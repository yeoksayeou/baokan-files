Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Nanjing dispatch: Long Yun, former Chairman of Yunnan Province and current President of the Military Advisory Council, issued a statement a few days ago condemning a few newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai for irresponsible reporting on the assassination of Li and Wen, stating that it involved personal legal responsibility. Long's accusation was triggered by recent extensive rumors spread by the *Shen Bao*, *Southeast Daily*, and others, claiming that Long Yun's son was the assassin of Li and Wen.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: The Kunming case has occurred for over ten days, causing an uproar in national public opinion. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to send Gu Zhutong and others to Kunming with "full authority" to handle the matter. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Kunming: "Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin, Gendarmerie Commander Zhang Zhen... and also accompanied by Lu Han (Chairman of Yunnan Province) and Huo Kuizhang (Commander of the Kunming Garrison), arrived in Kunming on the afternoon of the 27th and immediately listened to reports from all parties, carefully reviewing the situation... It is reported that Gu and others will inspect the southwest garrison after the case is resolved." (According to a Central News Agency dispatch: Gu, Leng, and others went to Guling from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 26th, and Chiang Kai-shek hosted a dinner for them at his residence at 9 p.m., with Huo Kuizhang, Zhang Zhen, and others in attendance. Furthermore, Tang Zong, the special agent chief previously sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Kunming to "investigate" the Kunming case, left Kunming for Shanghai on the 26th. Tang stayed in Kunming for three days, meeting with the Yunnan Provincial Government, the Garrison Headquarters, and "relevant agencies").

    谴责申报等造谣
    蒋派顾祝同调查昆明血案
    【新华社延安卅日电】南京讯：前云南省主席现任军事参议院院长龙云，曾于日前发表谈话，谴责京沪少数报纸对李闻被刺血案作不负责任之报导，且涉及私人应负法律责任。龙氏这一指责，起因于申报、东南日报等最近大肆造谣，说暗杀李闻者为龙云之子。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】昆案发生，瞬已兼旬，全国舆论哗然，蒋介石被迫又派出顾祝同等飞昆“全权处理”。据中央社昆明讯：“陆军总司令顾祝同率同副参谋长冷欣、宪兵司令张镇……并偕卢汉（云南省主席）、霍揆彰（昆明警备总司令）二十七日下午抵昆后，当即听取各方报告，详细检讨……。闻顾等一俟该案处理完毕后，将顺道巡视西南驻军。（按中央社讯：顾、冷等系二十六日下午自京赴牯岭，晚九时蒋介石在行馆约渠等晚餐，霍揆彰、张镇等在座。又前此蒋介石派往昆明“调查”昆案之特务头子唐纵，已于二十六日离昆飞沪，唐曾留昆三日，与滇省府警备总部及“有关机关”晤谈）。
