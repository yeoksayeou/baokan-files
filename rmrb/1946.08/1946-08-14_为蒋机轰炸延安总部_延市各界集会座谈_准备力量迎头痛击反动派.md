Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombing of the CCP Yan'an headquarters, a forum was held yesterday at 5:00 PM at the People's Education Center with representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an. Wang Hongyi, head of the Nanqu Chengguan Township, said: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan'an was the capital of all liberated areas, and Japanese imperialism wanted to bomb it. Now the Kuomintang reactionaries are also coming to bomb it, which is truly a strange thing." Mr. Bi Guangdou, a member of the Border Region Government, continued, "This is deliberately provoking a civil war." Merchant Ji Decheng said, "Last year, Chiang Kai-shek's planes even came to Yan'an to distribute leaflets, signed and sealed, saying that the civil war would be stopped; why doesn't that count?" Mr. Wu Hanzhang, a border region councilor and principal of the First Primary School, who was sitting with Bi Guangdou, warned the reactionaries angrily, "Qin Shi Huang wanted to be emperor for eternity, but ended up collapsing in the second generation. Now Chiang Kai-shek wants to be a dictator and emperor, and the people will not allow it!" Mr. Zhou Hongwen, former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, said, "During the War of Resistance, Japanese planes bombed Yan'an several times, but the people of Yan'an were not afraid, and we did what we were supposed to do as usual. Now, are we supposed to be afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's planes?" Wang Desheng, head of the Eastern District of Yan'an City, said, "The people of Yan'an have been tempered in war and cannot be threatened by airplanes and cannons!" Dr. Ma Hongzhang, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek relies on the help of American imperialist elements to fight the civil war. He said, "We must tell the American government to withdraw its troops from China!" At this time, a young citizen named Zhang Jingquan stood up and proposed: "If we oppose Chiang Kai-shek, we must take immediate action! Workers must step up production, the people must cultivate their crops well, and merchants must work hard to promote local products. At the same time, we must strengthen the self-defense forces. If the reactionaries attack, we will give them a head-on blow!"

　　为蒋机轰炸延安总部            
    延市各界集会座谈           
    准备力量迎头痛击反动派
    【新华社延安八日电】为蒋机轰炸中共延安总部事，昨日下午五时延市各界市民在民众教育馆举行座谈会。南区城关乡乡长王宏义说：“延安在抗战中是各解放区的首府，日本帝国主义要轰炸它。现在国民党反动派也来轰炸，真是一件怪事。”边区政府委员毕光斗老先生接着说：“这就是居心挑起内战。”商人姬德成说：“去年蒋介石飞机还来延安散了传单，签了名盖了章，说是停止内战；为什么就不算数了？”与毕光斗坐在一起的边区参议员第一完小校长吴汉章老先生激愤地警告反动派说：“秦始皇要永世称帝，结果到二世即亡。现在蒋介石要独裁称帝，人民是不允许的！”前商会会长周鸿温先生说：“抗战中日本飞机来延安炸了几次，我们延安老百姓也没有怕，该做什么还是照常做什么。现在难道就怕你蒋介石的飞机么？”延市东区区长王德胜说：“延安的老百姓是从战争中锻炼出来的，不是飞机大炮威胁得了的！”中医马鸿章老先生指出：蒋介石是依靠美帝国主义分子的帮助打内战。他说：“我们要告诉美国政府，把军队从中国撤出去！”这时一位青年市民张景泉起来提议：“我们反对蒋介石就要立刻行动起来！工人要加紧生产，人民要好好务庄稼，商人要努力推销土产，同时还要加强自卫军。反动派要打来，我们就给他一个迎头痛击！”
