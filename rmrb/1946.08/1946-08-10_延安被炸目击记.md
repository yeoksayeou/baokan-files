　　Eyewitness Account of the Bombing of Yan'an
　　By Ms. Anna Louise Strong
　　Editor's Note: Ms. Strong is a well-known columnist for various American newspapers and the author of several reportage works. Among them, "One-Fifth of Mankind," a book about the Chinese War of Resistance, has been particularly well-received. This time, she arrived in Shanghai in mid-July as a reporter for the Associated Press and eight newspapers, and flew to Yan'an from Ping on August 1st for an interview. This article was written specifically for the Associated Press. The author states that any Associated Press reporter can broadcast this article, and any Associated Press newspaper can reprint it.
　　At approximately 11:30 AM on August 2nd, the thunderous sound of explosions led us outside. The translator came to urge us to immediately run into the air-raid shelter. Hurrying over under the blazing sun, he repeatedly apologized for the late warning, as no one had anticipated an air raid. In the clear sunlight, I saw an airplane flying towards me in a seemingly annoying manner, at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. The Yan River divides Yan'an into two parts, and I was on the west bank of the river at the time. The plane turned to fly towards the eastern part of Yan'an, which is where the military headquarters and the residences of important officials are located. Near me, riflemen in the knee-deep grass were aiming with their rifles, but the plane was too high to reach. Soon, we reached the air-raid shelter, a sturdy sandstone shelter with a movable wooden door. Yan'an has many excellent air-raid shelters because it was often bombed by Japanese aircraft in the past. In fact, the city was almost completely destroyed! Most people live in cave dwellings on the mountains on both sides of the small river. Our shelter was crowded with people, including women and infants, but there was no panic. I spent most of the time standing outside the cave watching. The bombs exploded about a mile away on the east bank of the river, in the area of the military headquarters and the airfield. Finally, thick black smoke rose! Later, the all-clear signal sounded, and people went home to eat.
　　Investigations conducted jointly with U.S. military observers, along with Chinese testimonies, indicate that eight fighter planes first flew over Yan'an, using machine guns and incendiary bombs to concentrate fire on a "B-24" aircraft parked on the ground. This aircraft had flown from Chengdu to Yan'an on June 26th in a magnificent event and had been parked about a mile from the city. The fighter planes flew very low because Yan'an has no anti-aircraft guns. The "B-24" aircraft was completely destroyed by the accurate impact of the incendiary bombs.
　　Later, another bomber followed, dropping eleven bombs, estimated to be approximately 500-pound bombs based on the size of the craters. Nine of them landed in a straight line between the military headquarters and the airfield, but closer to the military headquarters. The other two landed on the mountainside. The forty farmers who were mowing grass there scattered, and no one was hit. The bomber flew southwest, presumably returning to Xi'an, which has been the source of harassment for Yan'an for ten years. Local Chinese believe the bomber's target was to bomb the military headquarters and the forty farmers because the "B-24" aircraft had already been destroyed. In any case, the bombing was extremely inaccurate and hit nothing but the foothills, which is not surprising because most of Yan'an is foothills and cave dwellings, making it difficult to hit anything. Except for the "B-24" aircraft, which is now scrap metal, nothing was damaged. This aircraft had dramatically flown from Chengdu to Yan'an six weeks earlier. The guards at Yan'an airfield, thinking it was an enemy plane, aimed their rifles at it. The door of the plane opened, and the pilot, Liu Shanben, came out, raised his hand in salute, and shouted, "Down with the Civil War!" When Liu explained that he did not want to fight the Communists either, only hoped for a united China, and was willing to preserve the plane for the future joint government's Ministry of National Defense, everyone cheered. The Yan'an Communists agreed with Captain Liu's desire not to use the plane for civil war. Moreover, due to the central government's long-term blockade, there was a severe shortage of gasoline, parts, and equipment, making it difficult to use the plane anyway. The idea that the Communists had an air force was simply a joke. For six weeks, Captain Liu and his "B-24" were the "Yan'an Air Force." The crude airfield here was only set up for American planes to connect with the U.S. military observer group every ten days. Some Communists proposed dismantling the plane's equipment because metal was extremely scarce here due to the central government's long-term blockade, and the parts and hardware from the plane were urgently needed. However, most opposed this suggestion for emotional reasons, because the plane was very new, valuable, and would one day be returned to China's joint government in a graceful manner, along with Captain Liu. So it was decided to exhibit the plane so that the people of the border region, who had often been bombed by Japanese aircraft but had never seen a bomber up close, could see what it actually looked like. The exhibition was originally scheduled to take place next week during the agricultural off-season, but it is now impossible to hold it. The "B-24" will now have to be used as scrap metal for Yan'an's factories.
　　Yan'an people view this bombing as a formal declaration of civil war. They also said, "Look at how an American plane destroyed another American plane!" They find it very ridiculous. When we came out of the air-raid shelter and went down the mountain, I saw the Chinese flag—what was once considered the Kuomintang flag, the Blue Sky with a White Sun—flying high on the flagpole. The same flag is flying over Nanjing. I pointed to the flag and raised what I thought was a very doubtful question: "Are you still hanging Chiang Kai-shek's portrait together with those of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill, as you did during the War of Resistance?" "Of course," the unexpected answer was: "We have never declared that we want to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek." This was a clear answer about fifteen minutes after the bombing. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　延安被炸目击记
    美史特朗女士
    编者按：史特朗女士系美国各报著名专栏作家，著有报告文学多种，其中以中国抗战为题材之《五分之一的人类》一书，尤博好评。此次她代表美联社、八个报纸的记者于七月中旬抵沪，于八月一日由平飞延采访。本文系专为美联社而作，作者自称本文任何美联社记者可以转播，任何美联社报纸可以转载。
    八月二日上午约十一点三十分，雷鸣的爆炸声把我们引到门外，翻译员来敦促立即跑进防空洞，他冒烈日匆匆走来，对警报发得太晚不断表示歉意，因为没人意料到会有空袭，在明朗的阳光照射下，我看见一架飞机似乎很讨厌地就向着我头上飞来，约为两千米的高度。延河把延安分成两部分，我当时就在河的西岸上。飞机转向延安东部飞去，那正是军事总部所在的重要官员所住的地方。在我附近的步枪手，在深至膝髁的草地里用来复枪瞄准着；但飞机太高，打不到。不久，我们就到了防空洞，这是一个坚固的沙岩的防空洞，安有可移动的木门。延安有许多优良的防空洞，因为过去常常遭受日本飞机的轰炸，事实上城内几乎完全被毁掉了！大部分人民住在小河两边山上的窑河里。我们那个防空洞挤满了人，有妇女和婴孩，没有惊惶。我大部分时间站在洞外注视。炸弹在一英里外河东岸军事总部与机场一带爆炸，最后乌黑的浓烟冒起了！以后解除警报响了，人们回家吃饭。
    与美军观察员共同调查，加上中国人的对证，表明八架战斗机先飞过延市，以机枪和烧夷弹集中向那一架停在地上的“Ｂ２４”飞机扫射和投掷，这架飞机是六月二十六日于壮伟的事件中从成都飞到延安来，并且就停在距城约一英里的地方。战斗机都飞得很低，因为延安没有高射炮。“Ｂ２４”飞机由于燃烧弹的准确轰击而完全毁坏了。
    后来还有一架轰炸机，紧跟着飞到投落十一颗炸弹，从弹坑的大小判断，大约都是五百磅的炸弹。其中九颗落在军事总部与机场之间的直线上，但较近于军事总部，另两颗投落山边。该处正在割草的四十个农民都散开，无人中弹。轰炸机向西南方向飞去，大概是返西安，这地方十年来经常是袭扰延安的来源。当地中国人认为轰炸机目标是要炸军事总部和四十个农民，因为“Ｂ２４”式飞机已经被毁坏了。无论如何，轰炸是极不准确的，除了山麓之外，什么也没有炸到，这是不足怪的。因为延安大部分地方都是山麓和窑洞，都很难命中，除了现在已成为废铁的“Ｂ２４”式机之外，没有任何地方受创。这架飞机是在六周前戏剧性地由成都飞到延安的，延安机场的守卫员以为是敌机，用步枪瞄准起来。飞机上的门开了，飞行员刘善本出来举手敬礼，高呼“打倒内战”。当刘氏解释他也不愿和共产党打仗，只希望有一个团结一致的中国，并愿保存这架飞机给以后联合政府的国防部时，每个人都欢呼致贺。延安共产党人赞同刘上尉不欲以飞机来进行内战的意愿，而且缺乏汽油没有零件及装备，也无论如何很难以使用的。共产党有空军一说，简直是开玩笑，六星期来，刘上尉及他的“Ｂ２４”即为“延安空军”。此地粗陋的飞机场，是仅仅为了美国飞机每十天一次与美军观察组连络而设的。某些共产党人提议卸除飞机装备，因为由于中央政府长期封锁，此地金属异常之缺乏，飞机上的零件五金正是此地所迫切需要的东西，但大多数因感情的理由，决定反对这一建议。因为飞机非常新式，很有价值，并且将来终有一天以优美的方式把刘上尉连同这架飞机一起送还中国的联合政府。于是决定把这架飞机展览，让虽常遭受日本飞机轰炸，却从未很近的看到轰炸机的边区人民，看看它究竟是什么样子。展览原规定下星期农闲时举行，现在却不可能展览了。“Ｂ２４”现在只好给延安的工厂当废铁用了。
    延安人士视此次飞机轰炸为内战之正式宣战，他们并称：“看一架美国飞机怎样炸毁了另一架美国飞机呀”！他们觉得这是非常可笑的。当我们从防空洞出来到山下时，我看到中国国旗曾被认为是国民党党旗的青天白日旗——高高地飘扬在旗杆上，飞扬在南京上空的也是这同一的旗帜。我指着这旗帜，提出我认为很可怀疑的问题道：“你们是否仍然像抗日战争时那样，将蒋介石的肖像和罗斯福、斯大林及邱吉尔的悬挂在一起呢”？“当然”，回答是出乎意料的：“我们从未宣布要推翻蒋介石”。这就是在轰炸后约十五分钟的一个明确的答复。（新华社）
