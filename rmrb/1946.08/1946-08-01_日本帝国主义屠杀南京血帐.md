Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo: On the 26th, Dr. Xu Fuyin, a Chinese witness, testified at the Far East International Military Tribunal regarding the Japanese army's entry into Nanjing. Mr. Xu stated: After the Japanese army entered Nanjing, they killed anyone they encountered. Mr. Xu was engaged in relief work at the time. Three days after the Japanese army entered the city, Mr. Xu witnessed Japanese officers inspecting the city to see if the corpses piled up on the streets could be removed. Mr. Xu counted the bodies on a certain main street and found that there were more than 500, most of whom had been subjected to torture before death. Mr. Xu stated: At that time, in Nanjing, regardless of north, south, east, or west, Chinese people were brutally murdered. The city was full of corpses, and the defendant Matsui was the commander of the Japanese army in the Nanjing area at the time. On the 26th, when Matsui listened to Mr. Xu's testimony, he moved his lower lip with his thumb and index finger, appearing quite fearful. Mr. Xu stated that the corpses he saw were all civilians. Wilson, an American doctor practicing medicine in Nanjing at the time, testified that traffic in Nanjing was not restored until the spring of 1939 after the city was occupied by the Japanese army. At that time, according to statistics, there were 21 opium dens on every mile of a street in the city. Later, Mr. Xu Fuyin added that at that time, the Chinese charity organization, the Red Cross alone, buried 42,000 corpses of people brutally murdered on the streets of Nanjing, most of whom were women who had been raped to death by the Japanese army. Mr. Xu stated: The Japanese army's rape atrocities are one of the ugliest pages in the history of world civilization, and he testified that among the eleven people he found who had been tortured to death, three women had been brutally raped by the Japanese army and then stabbed to death with bayonets. Mr. Xu witnessed a Chinese woman whose lower body was covered in blood after death, with a wooden stick inserted into her vagina, and another woman who was raped to death in bed, with a vase inserted into her vagina.
