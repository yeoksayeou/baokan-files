Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th (delayed dispatch). Chiang's troops, taking advantage of the conflict created in Anping, have spread and escalated the war to the Xianghe and Sanhe areas. Due to the delaying tactics adopted by both Chiang and the U.S. sides, the group from the Twenty-Fifth Special Team has been unable to go to the Xianghe front line to implement mediation and cessation of hostilities. This group was formed by order of the Three-Man Committee, specifically to mediate conflicts in the Xianghe area and is attached to the Twenty-Fifth Special Team. On the morning of the 11th, at a group meeting, the U.S. representative proposed four times that the CCP representative agree that this group was independent, attempting to isolate the Anping incident from the Xianghe war and obstruct a fair and reasonable resolution of the incident. The CCP representative immediately pointed out that this was inconsistent with the order of the Three-Man Committee and should be reserved. At this time, Chiang's representative, Wu ×ding, took the opportunity to make trouble and said, "Your reservation of opinion means that the group cannot work, and I want to protest." He echoed the U.S. representative. After the CCP representative's explanation, it was decided to discuss the group's departure based on the original order. The U.S. side then proposed that the group should go to the Anping area. The CCP representative believed that the group should first implement a ceasefire, but Anping town had already been captured by the Nationalists in violation of orders, and the war had exceeded Anping and expanded to the vicinity of Xianghe. Therefore, the group should go directly to Xianghe. The U.S. representative then agreed to this proposal, but wanted to go via Hewu, through Anping, and then to Xianghe. Chiang's representative also initially agreed. However, a few minutes later, Chiang's representative withdrew his opinion and insisted that the group only go to Hewu and Anping town. Therefore, the afternoon meeting ended without result. In the afternoon, the U.S. representative changed his opinion again, and the record cancelled the section agreeing to go to Xianghe. After the CCP representative's stern criticism, it was added again. At that time, the CCP representative took the initiative to concede, stating that they could go to Xianghe via Anping and Hewu, but the U.S. representative at this time completely overturned his opinion and refused to go to Xianghe. Due to the capricious nature of the Chiang and U.S. representatives, the group meeting ended without any results.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th (delayed dispatch). The Twenty-Fifth Special Team investigating the Anping incident continued to hold meetings on the 11th. The Chiang and U.S. representatives still attempted to have the team listen to a one-sided report from the U.S. Marines before the Three-Man Committee's instructions on investigation procedures arrived. Chiang's representative even attempted to undermine the principle of tripartite agreement in mediation through unilateral actions, causing the group to split and the mediation work to fall into a hopeless and dire situation. At the beginning of the meeting on the 11th, U.S. representative Colonel Davis declared that the Three-Man Committee would transmit an instruction stipulating the investigation procedure, and that before the instruction was received, the report of the U.S. Marines should be heard first. CCP representative Major General Huang Yifeng immediately pointed out that the report of the U.S. Marines representative was within the investigation procedure, and therefore it was not appropriate to act arbitrarily before the Three-Man Committee's official instructions arrived. Chiang's representative, Zhang Shuheng, even said: "Our two sides have the same opinion, and the other side cannot prevent us from acting." He proposed that the Chiang and U.S. sides should listen to the report of the U.S. Marines separately. The CCP representative immediately refuted him sternly, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned to await the Three-Man Committee's instructions on procedural matters.

　　冀东战火蔓延扩大蒋美代表拖延调处
    【新华社北平十二日电】（迟到）蒋军利用安平就地造成之战火，已蔓延扩大至香河、三河地区，由于蒋美双方采取拖延战术拖延时间，二十五特别小组的分组至今迟迟未能赴香河前线，实行调处制止。该分组系奉三委员之命组成，专为调处香河地区冲突之组织，附属于第二十五特别小组。十一日上午，分组会议上美代表四次提出，要中共代表同意这个分组是独立的，企图经此使安平事件与香河战争隔离起来，以阻碍事件公平合理的解决。中共代表当即认为这与三委员命令不符，应予保留。蒋方代表吴×定此时竟乘机取闹说：“你保留意见就是使小组不能工作，我要抗议。”与美代表一唱一和。经中共代表解释，决定仍根据原来命令，讨论分组出发事宜。美方又提分组应到安平地区，中共代表认为分组应首先实行停战，而安平镇已为国方违令攻占，战事已超过安平，扩大至香河附近，因此分组应直接去香河。美代表乃同意此议，但要走河西务，经安平再到香河，蒋方代表也一度表示同意。但数分钟后，该蒋方之代表又撤消了自己的意见，主张分组只到河西务、安平镇，故下午会议无结果。下午美代表又更改了自己的意见，记录取消了同意赴香河一段，经中共代表严正指责，乃重补上。但当时中共代表自动让步，表示可以经过安平、河西务到香河，但美方代表于此时却根本推翻了自己的意见，拒绝去香河。由于蒋美代表反复无常，使分组会议竟日无结果而散。
    【新华社北平十二日电】（迟到）调查安平事件之第二十五特别小组十一日继续举行会议，蒋美双方代表仍企图在三委员关于调查程序指示未到达前，先让小组听取美方陆战队的片面报告，蒋方代表更妄图以单独行动破坏三方一致协议的调处原则，使小组分裂，调处工作陷于无法收拾的恶劣境地。十一日会议开始时，美代表戴维思上校即宣称三委员将传达一指示规定调查程序，在指示未接到前，应先听取美陆战队之报告。中共代表黄逸峰少将当即指出美陆战队代表之报告，系在调查程序之内，故在三委员正式指示未到达前，未便随意行动。而蒋方代表张叔衡竟谓：“我们两方意见一致，另一方面不能阻止我们行动。”提议蒋美两方单独听取美陆战队之报告云云。中共代表当即严予驳斥，会议乃暂时休会，等候三委员关于程序问题之指示。
