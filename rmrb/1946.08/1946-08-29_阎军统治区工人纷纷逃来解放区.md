Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, August 24th: Workers in the areas controlled by Yan and Fu are living in extreme poverty and are fleeing to the liberated areas to make a living. The Fengzhen General Labor Union’s employment agency alone has placed 84 people in jobs since July. Having personally suffered from the oppression of the Yan and Fu reactionaries in the past, they immediately obtained employment and guaranteed living conditions upon arriving in the liberated areas, and have made rapid progress in their work and studies. Xu Shaojie, a worker from the "Guangming" power plant who fled from Datong, and Li Ruoliu, a worker from the "Dasheng" factory, not only work well but have also made leaps and bounds in labor, culture, and politics. Xu Shaojie has now been elected as a member of the labor union committee, and Li Ruoliu has been elected as the secretary of the labor union. Railway workers Liu Hanfeng, Wang Xiangdu, Lin Haisheng, and others have only received three payments from Yan Xishan since August of last year, averaging less than 50 kilograms of rice per month, and are living on the verge of starvation every day. After fleeing to Fengzhen, the station staff union immediately launched a donation drive, raising 7,950 yuan to provide temporary relief. The Pingdiquan Railway Union is also responsible for finding them jobs.

    工人纷纷逃来解放区
    【新华社兴县二十四日电】阎、傅统治区内，工人生活极端困苦，纷纷逃来解放区谋生。仅丰镇总工会职业介绍所，七月以来即按插工作的八十四人。他们过去亲身遭受阎、傅反动派压迫，一到解放区立即获得了职业，生活得到保障，工作学习均进步很快。从大同逃来的“光明”发电厂工友许绍介，“大生”厂工友李若留，不但工作好且在劳动、文化、政治方面亦有飞跃进步，现许绍介被选为工会委员，李若留被选为工会秘书。铁路工人刘汉丰、王祥杜、林海生等，自去年八月迄今阎锡山只发过三次饷，每月平均不到五十斤米，每天过着吃不饱的生活，逃来丰镇后，车站职工会立即发动捐款。七千九百五十元，予以临时救济，平地泉铁路工会并负责给他们找职业。
