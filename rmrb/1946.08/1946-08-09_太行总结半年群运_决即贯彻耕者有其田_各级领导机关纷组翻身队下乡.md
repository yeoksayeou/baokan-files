　　Taihang Summarizes Half-Year Mass Movement
    Resolves to Implement "Land to the Tiller"
    Leadership Organs at All Levels Form "Emancipation Teams" to Go to the Countryside

    [Our Newspaper] In order to achieve a swift, thorough, and victorious mass emancipation, cadres at all levels of the Party, government, army, and people in the Taihang region are working hard during this hot summer. The District Party Committee Office and the Research Office are busy summarizing the mass emancipation movement of the first half of the year. Based on this summary, they are clarifying achievements and shortcomings, and are making every effort to guide the even more ambitious emancipation movement in the next half year. It is reported that the Taihang emancipation movement in the first half of the year has achieved great results, but this summary shows that it is still far from meeting the demands of the masses for emancipation. Of the 37 new district counties and cities in the region, only Wu'an, Anyang, Changzhi, Lucheng, Cixian, Heshun, Xiyang, Xiangyuan, Shahe, and Xingtai have resolved most of the land issues when settling accounts for the blood and tears of various forms of exploitation. The remaining counties are much worse, and some counties have not even resolved the land issue at all, so the masses are basically still not emancipated. Based on these circumstances, the District Party Committee is calling on cadres to clear their minds and resolutely strive to complete the great cause of mass emancipation in the next half year.

    The Taihang Xinhua Daily specifically titled an article "In the Face of Intense Self-Defense Warfare, It Is Necessary to More Boldly Implement Mass Movements in the New District," calling for a thorough settlement of accounts for emancipation and resolving the land demands of farmers. It also pointed out that the development of the mass movement in this district, except for a portion that has already realized "land to the tiller" and transitioned to production movements, is mostly in the stage of in-depth movement. In some areas, the masses have been mobilized and some problems have been solved, but feudal tenant relations still exist in 40 percent [of cases], and the resolved land issues (excluding non-landlord relations of orphans and widows) only account for 38.5 percent. Some small and medium landlords have not yet reduced rent and interest, and cunning landlords are attempting to preserve feudal exploitation... Therefore, it is necessary to settle accounts for rent reduction and resolve the land issue, so that the masses can be thoroughly emancipated.

    The Administrative Office and the Political Department of the Military Region, in order to accomplish this great historical mission, jointly formed an "emancipation team" of more than 30 people, who are reportedly heading to the Fourth Military Sub-district within two or three days to help the masses emancipate themselves. The Second Military Sub-district formed an "emancipation team" of more than 400 people from students of the Taihang Second and Third Middle Schools and trainees from the Prefectural Party Committee Rectification Class. They completed their training at the end of last month and immediately went to Taigu, Yuci, and other counties to mobilize the masses to emancipate themselves. After returning from studying at the District Party Committee, the county party committees are holding cadre meetings and running emancipation training classes, summarizing the situation and problems of the first half-year movement, and preparing to set off a great emancipation upsurge in the entire district in the second half of the year.

　　太行总结半年群运
    决即贯彻耕者有其田
    各级领导机关纷组翻身队下乡
    【本报讯】为了群众翻身伟业迅速彻底胜利，太行全区党政军民各级干部在炎热的伏天里紧张的奔忙着。区党委办公室与调查研究室，正忙着总结前半年的群众翻身运动，从总结的基础上，明确成绩与缺点，全力指导今后半年内更宏伟的翻身运动。据悉：太行前半年翻身运动是有很大成绩的，但从这次总结中看出距群众的翻身要求还很远，全区新区三十七个县市中，只有武安、安阳、长治、潞城、磁县、和顺、昔阳、襄垣、沙河、邢台等十余县在清算各种剥削之血泪帐时，解决了大部土地问题，其余各县就差得很，有些县甚至根本没有解决土地问题，群众基本上仍未翻身。区党委根据这些情况，号召干部清醒头脑，坚决在今后半年内努力完成群众翻身伟业。
    太行新华日报顷特以“紧张的自卫战争面前必需更加放手贯彻新区群众运动”为题，号召彻底进行清算翻身，解决农民土地要求。并指出本区群运的开展，除一部分已实现了耕者有其田转入生产运动者外，大部处于深入运动的阶段。有些地区群众发动了，也解决了一些问题，但封建租佃关系尚存在百分之四十，被解决的土地问题（除孤寡户非地主关系者外），仅占百分之三八·五。若干中小地主尚没减租息，狡猾的地主企图保存封建剥削…………因此必需清算减租解决土地问题，使群众彻底翻身。
    行署与军区政治部，为完成这一伟大历史任务，合组翻身队三十余人，闻两三日内即赶赴四分区帮助群众翻身。二分区由太行二、三中学校学生及地委整风班学员共四百余人组成翻身队，已于上月底集训完毕，当即分赴太谷、榆次等县发动群众翻身。各县县委在区党委学习完毕回去后，正召开干部会与开办翻身训练班，总结前半年运动情况与问题，准备着掀起全区后半年的大翻身浪潮。
