    [Urgent Dispatch from Yangcheng, 14th of this Month] After reinforcements were completed, the Kuomintang troops in southern Shanxi began a large-scale offensive against us. On the 12th, the 53rd Division of the 90th Army moved from the Anyi-Xia County-Shuitou area to Wenxi. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, the Chiang troops' First Army in Wenxi, with a force of one division and under the cover of five planes, launched an offensive against our Dongzhen area (30 li northeast of Wenxi). From 5:00 AM, Kuomintang American-made planes continuously bombed and strafed the Dongzhen and Aikou areas for five hours. The invading Chiang troops were met with our resistance, and fierce fighting is currently taking place in the area south of Dongzhen.

    [Dispatch from Yangcheng, 12th of this Month] The Kuomintang reactionaries continue to transfer large armies from Henan and Shaanxi across the river to expand the civil war in southern Shanxi. The 30th Army led by Lu Chongyi, originally stationed on the Pinghan Railway Line, moved west via Luoyang in late July and crossed north from Tongguan in early August. Two divisions of this army advanced to Anyi and Yuncheng on the 7th and moved to Xia County on the 8th. The 53rd Division of the 90th Army, originally stationed in Xia County, was transferred to the Shuitou area on the same day to assemble, and two regiments of the 38th Army also crossed north from Taiyangdu in Pinglu on the 11th and advanced to Xia County and Anyi. The headquarters of the 27th Army is now stationed in Anyi, and the 47th Division and the remnants of the 31st Division under its command are assembled between Yuncheng and Shuitou. The headquarters of the First Army has now advanced to Wulitou, south of Wenxi, and the 78th Division and the 167th Division under its command are assembled along the Shuitou-Wenxi line, constantly launching probing attacks against our liberated areas, having already occupied our Dongguanzhuang, Xiangshansi, Zhao Jiazhuang, Qiu Jiazhuang, and Baishuling (8 li east of Wenxi). The Chiang troops in Xia County are also constantly attacking in coordination with Yan Xishan's "Love the Homeland Corps" in Xia County, occupying our Xinzhuang, Shizhuang, and Yuwangcheng (2 li southeast of Shuitou). At present, the Chiang troops entering southern Shanxi have reached a strength of eight divisions and are now deployed. Dong Zhao, Commander-in-Chief of the 38th Army Group and commander of the Chiang troops in the southern Shanxi civil war, stated that he is determined to open the traffic between Wenxi and Linfen in order to drive straight into the Taiyue Liberated Area.
