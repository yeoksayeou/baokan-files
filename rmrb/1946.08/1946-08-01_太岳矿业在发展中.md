    Taiyue Mining Industry is Developing
    With the support of the democratic government, industrial construction in the Taiyue region has been recovering and developing over the past year. Among them, the construction of coal, iron, and magnetic industries has been the most successful. Coal mines are abundant treasures in the Taiyue region, extending from Pingyao, Jiexiu, Qinyuan, Anze, Lingshi, Huoxian, Zhaocheng, Fushan, Yicheng, Changzi, Gaoping, Linfen, Qinshui, Yangcheng, and Jincheng in the north, to Yuanqu, Pinglu, and Jiyuan in the south, covering an area of approximately 560,000 mu. The highest quality coal is the anthracite from Jinpushan and Lishugou in Jincheng, which has been tested by experts and praised as the world's top-grade coal, containing 95% carbon and a heating value of over 20,000 calories. Iron ore is most abundant in Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping counties. According to incomplete statistics from these three counties, there were 3,297 iron furnaces (square, stir-fry, pot, bar, plow iron furnaces, etc.) before the war, employing 21,304 workers. Currently, 462 iron furnaces have been restored, employing 3,820 workers, with a total daily output of 228,130 jin, accounting for 22% of the pre-war total output. The development of the coal industry is inseparable from the development of the iron industry. Statistics from Jin, Gao, and Yang counties show that there were 417 well kilns and step kilns before the war, including three small machine kilns and one large machine kiln. Most of them ceased operation during the enemy and puppet occupation. After the war, our democratic government deeply understood that the mining of coal is directly related to the lives of the masses, so it invested a large amount of loans into the coal industry to support private mining. In just one year, it invested 31 million yuan. Currently, 249 well kilns and step kilns, and nine machine kilns have been restored, accounting for over 60% of the pre-war level. There are two types of business models: cooperative operation and private operation. Cooperative operation mainly involves workers with labor power who jointly raise funds and work together, distributing profits according to shares. For example, the Kuiji Furnace Factory in Xiyu Village, Jincheng, produced 65 furnaces of goods from November 26th last year to April 20th this year. After deducting costs, the thirteen workers earned a total of 223,795 yuan in wages and dividends. The thirteen workers and their 35 family members could each buy 4.745 shi of millet at the market price at the time. In private operation, such as Ji Zhende, the owner of Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory, was granted a loan of 50,000 yuan by the government as capital last year. In half a year, after deducting raw material costs and consumption, he earned a net profit of 85,844 yuan and developed another square furnace. He said happily: "Many people say that private furnaces cannot operate in our liberated areas, but this is a complete lack of understanding of the government's policies. Now I understand that engaging in production in the democratic liberated areas is completely profitable, and the government will also support your development." The lives of workers have also improved, with monthly wages of about 4,000 yuan. Workers at the Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory can also use their spare time and holidays to do sand turning for other factories, breaking the old rules that restricted workers in the past. The furnace factory also has worker bath facilities, and workers can freely go to take a bath after work every afternoon, paying considerable attention to workers' health. Due to the improvement of labor-management relations and the improvement of workers' production technology, significant results have also been seen. Worker Wang Bufang invented a method of combining square furnaces and pot furnaces for production after several days of research. In the past, square furnaces were dedicated to smelting ore, and then pot furnaces were used to melt and cast pots. However, after Wang Bufang's painstaking research, adding coal slag to the iron ore during smelting allows for direct pot casting, saving both raw materials and time. The Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory adopted this method, saving 260 yuan in raw material costs per furnace, resulting in a profit of 100,384 yuan in four months.

　　太岳矿业在发展中
    太岳区工业建设，一年来，在民主政府的扶持下恢复和发展着，其中尤以煤铁业磁业建设成绩最大。煤矿为太岳区丰富的宝藏，北从平遥、介休、沁源、安泽、灵石、霍县、赵城、浮山、翼城、长子、高平、临汾、沁水、阳城、晋城，直到南面的垣曲、平陆、济源等十八县，矿区面积约达五十六万余亩，质量最高者为晋城金普山、黎树沟的无烟炭，曾经专家化验，誉为世界高等煤炭，含炭素百分之九十五，热度为二万余卡。铁矿以晋城、阳城、高平三县为最多，据晋、阳、高三县不完全统计，战前有铁炉（方、炒、锅、条、犁铁炉等）三千二百九十七座，拥有工人两万一千三百零四人。现已恢复铁炉四百六十二座，工人三千八百二十个，每日总产量为二十二万八千一百三十斤，为战前总产量的百分之二十二。煤炭业的发展是与铁业发展分不开的，晋、高、阳三县统计，战前共有井窑步窑四百一十七座，有小机器窑三座，大机器窑一座，敌伪占领期间大部停止开采。战后我民主政府深知煤炭之开采直接关系于群众生活，故以大批贷款投入煤业中，扶植私人开采。仅一年时间，即投入资金达三千一百万元。现已恢复井窑步窑二百四十九座·机器窑九座，计达战前的百分之六十强。在经营方式上有合作经营、私人经营两种，合作经营大部为有劳动力之工人，共同集资共同劳动，按股分红。如晋城西峪村魁记炉厂，从去年十一月二十六日，截至今年四月二十日，共出六十五炉货，除成本外，十三个工人共赚工资洋及红利洋廿二万三千七百九十五元，十三个工人及其家属共卅五人，每人按当时市价可买入小米四石七斗四五。私人经营，如晋义西货铁厂厂主姬振德，去年政府贷给五万元作资本，半年中除原料成本及消耗外，净赚红利八万五千八百四十四元，又发展了一个方炉，他高兴的说：“许多人说咱解放区私人不能行炉，这全是对政府政策认识不够，现在我明白了，在民主解放区闹生产完全有利可图，政府还要扶植你发展”。至于工人生活也已改善，每月工资约四千元，晋义西货铁厂工人，并可利用闲暇、假期给别厂翻砂，打破过去束缚工人的旧行规。炉厂并有工人澡塘设备，工人每日下午下工可自由去洗澡，相当注意了工人健康。由于劳资关系的改善，工人生产技术的改良，亦见显著成效。工人王补方在数日研究中，发明了方炉与锅炉结合生产办法，过去方炉专司炼矿，再经锅炉溶化铸锅，但经王补方的苦心研究，在铁矿中和以煤渣溶炼，即可直接铸锅，既省原料又省时间，晋义西货铁厂采用此种办法，每炉可省原料费二百六十元，四个月中盈利十万零三千八百八十四元。
