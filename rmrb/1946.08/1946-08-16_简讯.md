    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Northeast Dispatch: The Kuomintang authorities in Shenyang have recently imposed several so-called "apportionments." Ticket apportionments alone are divided into two types: disaster relief and troop慰问. The former costs 13,000 yuan per ticket, and the latter costs 1,300 yuan per ticket. According to the baojia system, each household bears 845 yuan. Furthermore, the struggle for houses among Kuomintang officials here is becoming increasingly fierce, and the chaotic situation surpasses that of Peiping, Tianjin, and Beijing. The National Shenyang Compilation and Translation Bureau has even been turned into a military camp.
