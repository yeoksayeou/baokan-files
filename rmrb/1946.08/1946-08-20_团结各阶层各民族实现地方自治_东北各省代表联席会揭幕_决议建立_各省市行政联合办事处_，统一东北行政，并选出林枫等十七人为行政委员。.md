Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th - The Northeast Provinces Representatives Joint Conference, which has epoch-making significance in Northeast history, solemnly opened in Harbin on the morning of the 7th of this month. The purpose of the conference is to further unite the forces of all classes and nationalities in the Northeast to build a democratic and prosperous new Northeast, strengthen ties between the provinces, and determine unified guidelines and plans to achieve local autonomy in the Northeast. At the preparatory meeting held on the 6th, Zhang Xuesi, Chairman of Liaoning Province, reported on the significance of the conference and the preparations made on behalf of the conference organizing committee. He pointed out that when the Japanese surrendered last year and the Northeast people were liberated by the Democratic Allied Forces and the Soviet Red Army, people's representatives from all over the Northeast had convened a meeting in Shenyang to discuss plans for building a new Northeast, but the meeting had to be temporarily adjourned due to the Kuomintang's frenzied offensive. At that time, Lin Feng, Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, and others were elected to the presidium to prepare for the reopening of the meeting. Chairman Zhang Xuesi explained that over the past year, the people of the Northeast have effectively fought against the military offensives of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people of each province have successively elected their own governments and people's congresses, and formulated their own policy programs and guidelines according to their own will. Now, in order to strengthen the ties between the democratic regimes of the provinces and unify the democratic construction of the Northeast, the significance of this conference is very significant. The conference officially opened on the morning of the 7th. One hundred and eighty-six representatives from all over the Northeast, including seven Kuomintang members, seven members of the Northeast National Salvation General Association, one member of the Democratic League, three members of the Democratic Political Association, one member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, one member of the Anti-Imperialist League, two League members, fifty-four Communist Party members, representing various nationalities including Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Korean, from former officials and current democratic government staff to all sectors of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. After the meeting opened, Gao Chongmin, head of the Northeast General Branch of the Democratic League and Chairman of Andong Province, delivered an opening speech, explaining that the convocation of the conference was due to the fact that the people of the Northeast had seen through the true face of the Kuomintang reactionaries, recognized the benefits of democracy for them, and urgently needed democratic autonomy. He asked the conference to seriously study how to improve the democratic regime and establish policy guidelines, to transform governments at all levels from top to bottom and from bottom to top, so that today's democratic construction could be more extensive and in-depth. General Zhou Baozhong, one of the leaders of the Northeast Anti-Japanese resistance, spoke about the tasks of the Northeast people from the history of the Northeast people's fourteen-year struggle to the current task. The conference inherited the speech of Comrade Peng Zhen, representative of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC and the headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces. Comrade Peng Zhen called on the conference to strive for independence, peace, and democracy in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Chinese people's nation-building. Following this, Mr. Chen Xianzhou, head of the Northeast Democratic Political Association and Speaker of the Andong Provincial Assembly, Mr. Xie Yuqin, President of the Harbin China-Soviet Friendship Association, and representatives of workers, peasants, women, troops, and Mongolian and Hui minorities spoke. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their determination to unite around the conference and strive to eliminate the reactionary offensives and defend and build a democratic new Northeast.
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th - At the Northeast Provinces Representatives Joint Conference, all the representatives unanimously passed the establishment of the "Joint Administrative Office of Northeast Provinces and Municipalities (Special Municipalities)," which is the highest organ for promoting democratic construction in the Northeast provinces and unifying the administration of the Northeast provinces. The conference also elected Lin Feng, Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, Zhou Baozhong, Che Xiangchen, Zou Dapeng, Feng Zhongyun, Wan Yi, Yan Baohang, Gao Chongmin, Li Youwen, Liu Lanbo, Tang Hongjing, Yu Yifu, Chen Xianzhou, Li Du, Li Yanlu, Guan Junyan, Jin Guangxia, Ning Wu, Han Youtong, Zhou Jingwen, Tang Feng'a, Tang Shouga, Zhu Qiwen, Song Shende, Temuer Bagen, and seventeen others as administrative committee members of the office, including Communist Party members, Kuomintang members, Democratic League figures, Northeast elders, representatives of the Anti-Japanese United Army and the Democratic Allied Forces, Mongolian and Korean national representatives who had contributed to the Anti-Japanese War, and Northeast democratic figures from within the customs. Before the election, the conference conducted a careful discussion on the organizational outline of the office and the election method of the administrative committee members. First, Mr. Lin Feng explained the organizational outline in detail on behalf of the presidium, pointing out that the draft election plan of the outline stipulated that the election of the administrative committee members would be carried out by first electing candidates from each delegation, and then conducting a secret ballot at the conference, first going through a preliminary election, and then conducting a formal election, and the election could not be restricted by the list of candidates. This point also fully demonstrated the democratic spirit of this conference. Mr. Lin Feng also explained the relationship between the joint office and the provinces and cities, which is a direct superior-subordinate relationship. The office will set up nine committees according to actual needs, and the term of office of each committee member is one year. Comrade Lin Feng stressed: This organization was established in accordance with the will of all the people in the Northeast. After the liberation of the Northeast, our Northeast people expected the establishment of a local joint government in the Northeast, but the Kuomintang reactionaries not only failed to meet our requirements, but also mobilized large armies to launch a civil war in the Northeast, attempting to eliminate the democratic regime of the Northeast people. We named this a joint office this time, which also shows that this is a transitional and temporary institution, which means that we still expect the establishment of a democratic joint government with local autonomy. Following this, representatives spoke, and the Mongolian and Korean representatives proposed adding a minority ethnic committee under the joint office to deal with minority ethnic issues. After discussion, it was adopted. The issue of the power to interpret the organizational outline and other clauses was also seriously discussed, revised, or supplemented by the conference. At this point, the organizational outline was adopted.

    东北各省代表联席会揭幕     
    决议建立“各省市行政联合办事处”，统一东北行政，并选出林枫等十七人为行政委员。
    【新华社哈尔滨十六日电】在东北历史上具有划时代意义的东北各省代表联席会，已于本月七日上午在哈市隆重揭幕举行。该会的目的，在于进一步团结东北各阶层各民族力量建设民主的繁荣的新东北，并加强各省联系，确定统一的方针与计划，以实现东北的地方自治。在六日举行的预备会议上，辽宁省主席张学思代表大会筹委会报告会议意义及筹备经过，指出当去年日本投降，东北人民为民主联军及苏联红军解放后，东北各地人民代表曾在沈阳召开会议商讨建设新东北的大计，但旋因国民党的疯狂进攻，该会不得不暂告休会。当时并选出林枫、吕正操、张学思等七人为主席团，筹备重开会议。张学思主席说明一年来东北人民一方面有效的打击了国民党反动派的军事进攻，一方面各省人民皆先后选举了自己的政府和民意机关，并按照人民自己的意志制订了施政纲领与方针。今为加强各省民主政权的联系，统一东北民主建设事，故此次会议之意义非常重大。七日上午大会正式揭幕。一百八十六位来自东北各地的代表，包括国民党员七人，东北救亡总会七人，民主同盟一人，民主政治协会三人，东北抗日救国会一人，反帝大同盟一人，同盟会员二人，共产党员五十四人，代表中包括汉、蒙、回、韩各民族，从旧官吏现任民主政府工作人员，到工农商学兵各界。开会后，首由民主同盟东北总支部负责人安东省主席高崇民先生致开会词，说明大会之召集系由于东北人民已看清了国民党反动派的真面目，认识了民主对他们的好处，急切需要民主自治。他要求大会，要认真研究怎样才能健全民主政权确立施政方针，自上而下的，自下而上的改造各级政权，使今天的民主建设更加广泛和深入。东北抗日领袖之一周保中将军，从东北人民十四年斗争历史谈到当前东北人民的任务。大会继承中共东北中央局及民主联军总部代表彭真同志讲话。彭真同志号召大会要本着中国人民建国的根本方针，为实现独立、和平、民主而奋斗。继起讲话者，有东北民主政治协会负责人安东省议长陈先舟先生、哈市中苏友好协会会长谢雨琴先生及工、农、妇女、部队与蒙回少数民族代表。各代表讲话中，皆一致表示定要团结在大会周围，为消灭反动派进攻，保卫与建设民主的新东北而奋斗。
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】东北各省代表联席会上，全体代表一致通过成立“东北各省市（特别市）行政联合办事处”，此乃推进东北各省民主建设、统一东北各省行政的最高机关。大会并根据办事处组织大纲中之选举法选出林枫、吕正操、张学思、周保中、车向忱、邹大鹏、冯仲云、万毅、阎宝航、高崇民、栗又文、刘澜波、唐洪敬、于毅夫、陈先舟、李杜、李延禄、关俊彦、金光侠、宁武、韩幽桐、周鲸文、唐丰阿、唐寿轧、朱其文、宋慎德、特穆尔巴根等十七人为该办事处之行政委员，其中包括共产党员、国民党员、民主同盟人士、东北耆老、抗联与民主联军、抗日有功之蒙、韩民族代表及关内东北民主人士。大会在选举之前，曾对该办事处之组织大纲与行政委员选举办法进行慎重讨论，首由林枫氏代表主席团对组织大纲详细说明，指出大纲之选举草案中规定行政委员之选举，系采取先由各代表团推选候选人，再在大会进行无记名投票，先经过预选，再进行正式选举，且选举时可以不受候选名单的限制。此点亦充分显示此次大会的民主精神。林枫氏并说明此联合办事处和各省市的关系，乃是直接的上级关系，办事处下根据实际需要设九个委员会，各委员之任期为一年。林枫同志力称：这个组织乃是遵照全东北人民的意志成立的，在东北解放后，我们东北人民即期望成立一东北地方性的联合政府，但国民党反动派非但不能满足我们的这种要求，反而调动大军在东北发动内战，企图将东北人民的民主政权消灭。我们这次取名联合办事处，亦表明这是一个过渡时期临时性质的机构，这就是说我们还期待地方自治的民主的联合政府的成立。继由各代表发言，蒙、韩代表提议联合办事处下增设一少数民族委员会，以处理少数民族问题。经讨论后获得通过。关于对组织大纲的解释权问题及其他条文，亦经大会认真讨论修正或补充。至此组织大纲乃获得通过。
