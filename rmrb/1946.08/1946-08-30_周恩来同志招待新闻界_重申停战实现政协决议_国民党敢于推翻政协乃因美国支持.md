Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th, the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party received the press at 3:30 PM on the 26th, hosted by Zhou Enlai. During the reception, summaries of the "Immediate Unconditional Ceasefire and Implementation of Political Consultative Conference Resolutions" editorial from the Xinhua News Agency-printed Masses Weekly were distributed as the CCP's formal statement on the current situation. The statement briefly stated: "The *Masses* magazine, published in Shanghai on August 25th, published a lengthy editorial in response to Chairman Chiang's August 14th statement, titled 'Immediate Unconditional Ceasefire and Implementation of Political Consultative Conference Resolutions.' I believe that Chairman Chiang's statement not only failed to change this situation, but also worsened it, because the conditions for a ceasefire he proposed were that 'the Communist troops withdraw from many areas and the locally elected governments be abolished, to be taken over by the Kuomintang one-party government.'" The editorial pointed out how the government authorities overturned the ceasefire, the Political Consultative Conference, military reorganization and other agreements, for example, after the announcement of the January ceasefire agreement, the government side consistently failed to implement a ceasefire in the Northeast, failed to accept General Marshall's proposal, and failed to dispatch executive groups to the Northeast, which the CCP immediately approved. Later, although there was an agreement on March 27th, which allowed the dispatch of groups to the Northeast, the government side then violated the agreement by refusing a ceasefire and engaging in large-scale fighting in the Northeast. Even after the June truce, the offensive in the Northeast temporarily eased, but the offensive within the passes spread north and south of the Yellow River. The Kuomintang government still occupies 59 county towns and more than 3,000 villages in our liberated areas.

　　During the June ceasefire negotiations, the CCP, in an effort to achieve peace, did not hesitate to make significant concessions in supplementary agreements on issues such as a ceasefire in the Northeast, restoration of transportation, and military reorganization. However, during the negotiations, the government authorities unreasonably raised the issue of the US side having the final say... Just as the agreement was about to be concluded, the government suddenly demanded that the CCP troops and local elected governments withdraw from Subei, along the Jiaoji Railway, south of Chengde in Rehe, and Andong, otherwise the four agreements could not be signed and a ceasefire would be difficult to achieve. The CCP believes that the location of troops implementing the military reorganization plan should not be confused with local administration, and the issue of local political power has been clearly stipulated in the appendix to the Political Consultative Conference program, so it firmly rejected this demand that exceeded the scope of the ceasefire negotiations. At the beginning of the month, the five demands raised by the government authorities through Ambassador Stuart continued to increase, and the authorities took these demands "as preconditions for a comprehensive ceasefire and negotiations on government reorganization."

　　The government not only violated agreements on ceasefire, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, but also overturned the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Chiang's four promises long ago. Regarding the reorganization of the government, "the government has consistently failed to agree on the number of committee members and the one-third veto power in accordance with the resolution, and in violation of the resolution, it wants the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee to select these committee members from other parties and non-party members." Also, "regarding the National Assembly resolution, first because the government had not been reorganized, the draft constitution had not been reviewed, and it was inconvenient for all parties to submit a list of representatives, and later because the government side proposed increasing the number of representatives, the proportion of representatives was not agreed upon. As the May 5th deadline approached, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group, under the convocation of Chairman Chiang, decided to postpone the National Assembly and explained that the date of the meeting would be determined after all parties had negotiated. Unexpectedly, on July 3rd, the government authorities announced on their own that the National Assembly would be held on November 12th of this year without consulting with the Political Consultative Conference, so the Political Consultative Conference resolution was completely swept away."

　　The editorial pointed out: "One of the main reasons why the Kuomintang dares to overturn the Political Consultative Conference is because the United States government provides them with assistance in any situation." The editorial then pointed out: "General Marshall cannot but bear considerable responsibility on this issue, but it is not impossible for General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to mediate successfully."

　　The editorial finally analyzed the six guidelines proposed in Chairman Chiang's statement, pointing out that the aforementioned five demands are at its core: "The core is that the war cannot be stopped unless the CCP withdraws from certain areas." The editorial clearly stated the CCP's attitude, saying: "We always insist that the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be fully implemented, the Political Consultative Conference organization must continue to exist, and it should be allowed to negotiate government reorganization, review the final amendment to the constitution, agree on National Assembly representatives, and elect various committees with the participation of all parties. These matters can only be handled by the Political Consultative Conference."

　　周恩来同志招待新闻界
    重申停战实现政协决议
    国民党敢于推翻政协乃因美国支持
    【新华社延安二十七日电】据中央社南京二十六日电：中共代表团于二十六日下午三时半招待新闻界，由周恩来主持。招待会中散发新华社所印群众周刊社论“立即无条件停战、实行政协决议”一文之提要，以作为中共对于时局之正式声明。该声明略称：八月二十五日上海出版之《群众》上，发表一篇针对蒋主席八月十四日文告的长篇社论，题为“立即无条件停战、实行政协决议”。我认为蒋主席的这一文告，不仅未能改变这种局势，而且更恶化这一局势，因为他所提出的停战条件，是要“中共部队撤出许多地区，并将当地民选政府取消，由国民党一党政府来接收”。社论指出政府当局如何推翻停战、政协、整军等协定，例如在一月停战协定宣布后，政府方面始终不实行东北停战，不接受马歇尔将军提议、并为中共所立即赞同的派遣执行小组到东北。后来虽有三月二十七日协议，得以派遣小组到东北，但政府方面却又违约拒绝停战，且在东北大打。直到六月休战，东北进攻暂稍和缓，而关内进攻又遍于黄河南北，国民党政府至今犹占据我解放区的县城五十九座，村庄三千多处。
    在六月休战协商中，中共为力求达成和平愿望，在东北停战、恢复交通与整军问题等补充协议中，均已不惜作重大让步。可是在商谈中，政府当局曾无理的提出美方最后决定权问题………协议将成，政府忽又要求中共部队及地方民选政府须撤出苏北、胶济路沿线、热河承德以南及安东四处，否则四项协议不能签字，停战即难实现。中共认为实施整军方案的军队驻地，决不能与地方行政混为一谈，而地方政权问题，在政协纲领附记中已有明文规定，乃坚决拒绝这种超出休战协商项目的要求。月初政府当局经由司徒大使提出的五项要求，竟愈提愈多，当局并以这些要求“作为全面停战与商谈政府改组的先决条件”。
    政府不仅破坏停战、整军及恢复交通等协议，而且早已推翻政协五项决议与蒋主席的四项诺言。关于改组政府，“政府对委员名额与三分之一的否决权，始终不依决议商定，而且违反决议，要在国民党中央常委会遴选这些其他党派与无党派的委员”。又如“关于国民大会决议，先因政府未曾改组、宪草审议未定、各方面未便提交代表名单，后因政府方面提议增加名额，致代表比例又未商安。及至五五期近，政协综合小组在蒋主席召集下，乃决定国大延期，并说明待各方商妥后，再定召开日期。不意七月三日，政府当局竟不经政协协商，迳自宣布本年十一月十二日召开国大，于是政协决议就扫地无余”。
    社论指出：“国民党之所以敢于推翻政协，主要原因之一，是由于美国政府不论在任何情况下都给他们以帮助。”社论接着又指出：“在这个问题上，马歇尔将军不能不负相当责任，然而马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使的调处，不是不可能成功的。”
    社论最后分析蒋主席文告中所提出的六项方针，指出前述的五项要求是他的中心所在：“中心就是中共不撤出若干地区，战争就不能停止”。社论鲜明地说明了中共的态度，他说：“我们始终坚持政协五项决议必须全部实现，政协组织必须继续存在，允其协商政府改组，审定宪章最后修正案，商定国大代表，推定由各方人士参加的各种委员会等事，更非政协莫办。”
