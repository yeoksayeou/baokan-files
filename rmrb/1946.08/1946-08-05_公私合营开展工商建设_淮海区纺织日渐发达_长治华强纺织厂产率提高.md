Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd. The industry and commerce of the Huaihai area in the Suwan Border Region has developed greatly in recent years, which is due to the democratic government's excellent industrial and commercial policies and the rapid recovery and prosperity of the rural economy. In the past winter and spring, the Huaihai Prefectural Commissioner's Office successively issued huge amounts of agricultural loans, including various loans such as plowing cattle, fertilizers, and green seedlings, totaling 9.3 million Central China currency (nearly 300 million legal tender), and 500,000 jin of grain, benefiting 17,000 people. In addition, a separate allocation of 10,000 yuan and 300 jin of cotton was provided to support the rural household textile industry throughout the region. "Cotton Shop Cloth Exchange Stations" were widely established to exchange cloth, so that private textile funds could circulate and new difficulties in textiles could be overcome more quickly. It was also clearly stipulated that all troops and agencies in the region must purchase local cloth to solve the problem of local cloth sales. The textile industry in the region has developed from 103,077 spinning wheels and 1,066 looms last winter to 163,210 spinning wheels and 144,500 looms at present. The development of Huainan Town in Puyang City, which was newly liberated, is the fastest. The town had 40 looms last year, and now has 117, an increase of three times. In terms of industry and commerce, the First Branch of the Central China Bank issued industrial loans of 20 million yuan (the same below for 600 million legal tender), commercial credit loans of more than 1 million yuan, commercial wholesale loans of more than 1.3 million yuan, and small loans of 300,000 yuan. This spring, the Sixth Prefectural Commissioner's Office also clearly ordered the loan bureau to postpone the collection of spring and summer production and sales taxes. At present, there are more than 1,000 public and private factories in the region, including textiles, cigarettes, cotton ginning, leather, papermaking, and soap industries, with a total capital of 2.63 million yuan, of which private capital accounts for three-fifths. Now public factories have turned to public-private joint ventures to fully absorb private capital and develop private capital. The state-owned "Hua Xin Tobacco Company" has also begun to increase capital to raise shares to expand its capital to 30 million yuan, and has purchased cigarette machines and installed motors in large quantities, which will become the first machine factory in the region. In terms of operation, state-owned stores focus on taking care of and supporting small businesses. During the spring famine this year, state-run stores in various places wholesaled 2 million square feet of local cloth, 50,000 taels of silkworm cocoons, and a large number of Huaizi, mats, etc. to small and medium-sized merchants, which greatly benefited them. For example, cloth merchant Zhao Zihe only had capital of two bolts of cloth, but after obtaining loans and support from state-owned stores, his capital has expanded tenfold. Now Shuyang City produces more than 2,000 square feet of local cloth every day, which is not enough for sales in the city. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office is allocating 80 million yuan in Mucheng and collecting private shares to establish a local product consignment office and the "Yimin Cooperative" to further develop the local product business in the region.

(This newspaper Changzhi dispatch) The implementation of "labor-capital cooperation" in the city's Huaqiang Textile Factory has increased the productivity of workers by more than one time. The factory has been operated by the agency since March 20th. Before and after April 20th, due to the withdrawal of some funds by the agency, wages were not stipulated, and the business policy was not clear, which caused the productivity of workers to decline. On May 10, the factory held a meeting to review and determined that the factory would implement "labor-capital cooperation" in the future. The public contributes capital, the workers contribute labor, and the labor-capital profit-sharing method is implemented. The workers manage the factory themselves. Since then, the workers have established a sense of ownership, and their lives have gradually improved. The production mood and quality have doubled compared with the past. In the past, three or four workers weaved a bolt of cloth, and in May, each worker weaved one bolt (28 feet). On June 10, when the factory summarized the production achievements in January, 12 workers and 3 machines weaved a total of 71 bolts of cloth, earning 500 yuan per bolt, for a total of 35,500 yuan. After deducting food and miscellaneous expenses, the net remaining profit was 20,000 yuan. According to the "capital 2, labor 8 profit sharing", the workers benefited 16,000 yuan. In order to help the factory develop rapidly, the government specially loaned 30,000 yuan. Under this rising production mood, a one-month production plan from June 10 to July 10 was drawn up, and it is estimated that a net surplus of 44,000 yuan can be obtained after deducting food and miscellaneous expenses, and the workers' income will be doubled by a 3-7 profit sharing (capital 3, labor 7).

　　公私合营开展工商建设
    淮海区纺织日渐发达
    长治华强纺织厂产率提高
    【新华社淮阴二日电】苏皖边区淮海地区工商业数年来有很大发展，这是由于民主政府优良的工商政策及农村经济的迅速恢复与繁荣的结果。去冬今春两季淮海专署曾先后发放巨大数字的农业贷款，计有耕牛、肥料、青苗等各种贷款华中币九百三十万元（合法币近三万万元），粮食五十万斤，受益者一万七千人。并另拨款一万元，棉花三百斤，扶助全区农村家庭纺织业。普遍建立“花店布交换所”换布，使民间纺织资金周转，加速克服纺织新的困难。并明令规定全区部队机关一律采购土布，以解决土布销路问题。全区纺织业自去年冬一○三、○七七架纺车，一、○六六架织布机发展到目前一六三、二一○架纺车，一四四、五○○架织布机，尤以新解放的濮阳城之淮南镇发展最速，该地去年织机四十架，现已有一百一十七架，增加三倍。工商业方面，华中银行第一分行在全区发放工业贷款二千万元（合法币六万万元以下同此），商业信用贷款一百余万元，商业批采贷款一百三十余万元，小本贷款三十万元。今春六专署并明令贷款局缓征春夏季产销税收。现全区有公私营工厂千余家，包括纺织、香烟、弹花、皮革、造纸、肥皂等业，资金共二百六十三万元，其中私资占五分之三。现公营工厂已转向公私合营方式，充分吸收民资，发展私人资本。公营“华新烟草公司”，亦开始增资招股扩大资金到三千万元，并添购卷烟机大量装置马达，将成为全区第一家机器工厂。公营商店在经营的方式上，以照顾扶助小商人为主。在今年春荒期中，各地工营商店将收购的土布二百万方尺，蚕茧丝五万两，及大量华子、席子等，批发给中小商人，使中小商人获益甚大。如布商赵子和只有两匹布资本，自获得贷款及公营商店扶植后，资金已扩大十倍。现沭阳城一地日产土布二千余方丈，在本市销售尚嫌不够，专署正在沐城拨款八千万元并收集私股创办土产代销所与“益民合作社”，以进一步发展全区土产事业。
    【本报长治讯】本市华强纺织厂实行“劳资合营”，工人生产率飞速提高一倍余，该厂自三月廿日开始由机关经营。四月廿日前后，由于机关抽走部份资金，工资又未规定，营业方针也不明确，致使工人生产率降低。五月十日，全厂开会检讨，确定今后工厂“劳资合营”，公家入资本，工人入劳力，实行劳资分红办法，由工人自己管理工厂，从此，工人树立了主人翁思想，生活也渐渐改善，生产情绪和质量比过去提高一倍。过去三四个工织一匹布，五月每工就织一匹（市尺二丈八尺）。六月十日该厂总结一月生产成绩时，十二个工人，三架机子，共织布七十一匹，每匹布赚洋五百元，共计赚洋三万五千五百元，除伙食杂支消费外，净余红利二万元，按“资二劳八分红”，工人得利一万六千元。政府为帮助工厂迅速发展，特贷款三万元。在这高涨的生产情绪下，又订出六月十日至七月十日一月生产计划，预计除伙食杂支消费可净余四万四千元，以三七分红（资三劳七），工人收入较前增加一倍。
