　　(This dispatch from Yangcheng) Jincheng has recently gained some urban work experience, which is introduced below: (1) Some time ago, merchants in Jincheng had "three fears" in their minds: First, they feared that the farmers' struggle would damage the interests of their shops and workshops. Second, they feared that state-owned shops would squeeze them out of business. Third, they feared that shop assistants and clerks would settle old scores. These thoughts hindered commercial development. Shop assistants and clerks were also afraid of bankrupting their employers and losing their jobs. To this end, the Chengguan District Office convened a symposium with representatives of more than 260 shops in the city to discuss the matter. At the meeting, encouraged by the government, merchants put forward these concerns, and the government immediately put forward three guarantees and requirements: First, it guaranteed that the peasant movement would not harm the interests of industrialists and businessmen except for rent and interest reduction. At the same time, merchants were required to automatically resolve the issue of rent and interest with farmers. Second, it guaranteed the abolition of the special rights of state-owned shops, and at the same time required private shops to change their practices of "harming others to benefit oneself, hoarding and speculating" to "benefiting oneself and others, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and taking profit with benevolence." Third, it guaranteed that shop assistants and apprentices would not settle old scores, and at the same time required shopkeepers not to illegally treat or fire shop assistants and apprentices. After discussion, it was decided to establish a chamber of commerce to resolve disputes between merchants and farmers through mediation. (2) What to do after the urban masses were liberated was a very troubling issue for the leadership in the past. The city had no land to organize mutual aid in production, and the industries of the poor people were complex and scattered. Because they could not find a direction for a while, some people developed the phenomenon of idleness, heavy eating and drinking, and wasting the fruits of struggle. Recently, after discussions among the masses in various streets, they found a way to develop small-scale cooperative handicraft workshops, organizing former millers, musicians, wet nurses, etc., to form various small workshops or groups for spinning, wool spinning, saltpeter boiling, flour milling, etc., which have now begun to operate. (3) Because landlords in the city compensated farmers for losses with houses, citizens who originally lived in landlords' houses had housing problems. In West Street, out of 500 households, 200 households were facing housing panic. After consultation with the Farmers' Association, it was decided to temporarily handle the matter according to the following two principles: A. If the houses originally belonged to local tyrants, landlords, temples, or communities and had been inhabited by poor people or small merchants for more than 30 years, they would be distributed to the residents without compensation and become private property. B. If the houses originally belonged to general landlords and had been inhabited by ordinary citizens for less than 30 years, the residents could buy them at a low price. (Siyuan)

　　晋城创造城市工作经验
    解决商人“三怕”思想     
    翻身市民合作生产
    【本报阳城讯】晋城最近取得几点城市工作经验，特介绍于下：（一）前些时晋城商人思想存在着“三怕”，一、怕农民斗争会损害到自己商店与作坊的利益。二、怕公营商店把自己挤垮。三、怕店员伙计们算旧账。这些思想曾使商业发展受到阻碍。店员伙计们也怕弄垮东家，自己失业。城关区公所为此特召集全城二百六十余家商店代表座谈研讨。会上，商人在政府鼓励下，提出了自己这些顾虑，政府当即提出三项保证和要求：第一、保证农民运动除减租减息外，绝不损害工商业家的利益。同时要求商人自动和农民解决租息问题。第二、保证取消公营商店的特殊权利，同时要求私营商店改变“损人利己，屯积居奇”的做法为“利己利人，调剂有无，仁中取利”。第三、保证店员、学徒不算旧账，同时要求掌柜不能违法苛待或开除店员和学徒。经过大家讨论，决定成立商会，以调解办法解决商人和农民间纠纷。（二）城市群众翻身后再干什么，是过去领导上很苦恼的问题。城市既无土地组织生产互助，而贫民行业又很繁杂分散，由于一时找不着方向，部分群众产生游手好闲，大吃二喝，浪费斗争果实的现象。最近经过各街群众讨论，找到了一条发展小型合作性手工业作坊的生产门路，把从前的推磨的、吹鼓手、奶妈子等都组织起来，组成纺织、纺毛线、熬硝、磨面等各种小作坊或小组，现已开始进行。（三）因城里地主以房屋偿还农民损失，原来居住地主房屋的市民发生房子问题。西街五百户，即有二百户发生住房恐慌。经过和农会商讨后，决定暂按以下两原则处理：甲、房屋原属恶霸、地主、庙社，而为贫民、小商居住三十年以上者，无价分配给住户，成为私产。乙、原属一般地主，而为普通市民居住在三十年以下者，住户可以低价收买。（思远）
