　　Taking Care of Industry and Commerce, Understanding the Characteristics of Citizens
　　The Mass Movement in Linqing City is Large-Scale
    [Our paper's dispatch from Weixian] Since the 7th, Linqing City has launched a large-scale anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, overthrowing Su Ziming, the head of the puppet North China Business Office who recognized the enemy as his father and squeezed merchants and civilians, and Ji Xiaofan, the feudal evil landlord who ruled and squeezed the masses for many years. The citizens recovered losses of 16 million yuan. More than 3,600 citizens participated in mass organizations during the movement, and the following experiences were gained:
    (1) Understand the characteristics of citizens and grasp their demands. The occupations of urban civilians are very scattered and complex, and their suffering is diverse. For example, the 114 households in Taoyuan Street who participated in mass organizations include the extremely poor, the poor, vendors, small merchants, large cart drivers, mud workers, shoemakers, small shop assistants, long-term and short-term workers, church servants, and other types of people. They have suffered significant rule and oppression from the Kuomintang government, Japanese invaders, traitors and puppets, and evil landlords. Their lives are extremely poor, and they struggle to find their next meal. We must carefully investigate and research, deeply discover their suffering, and boldly let them rise up. During the movement, take care of their living difficulties, hold fewer large meetings, utilize evening meetings, and provide economic assistance.
    (2) There were a particularly large number of traitors and puppets in Linqing City in the past, but most of them were civilians forced by life. Therefore, in addition to severely punishing a small number of heinous, die-hard big traitors and evil bullies, most were educated to repent and rehabilitate themselves. During this movement, the first few people were moved by our education, frankly confessed their sins, and obtained the leniency of the masses, restoring their civil rights. Under their influence, more than 20 people immediately reformed, and some have already found suitable jobs.
    (3) In the anti-traitor liquidation movement, the interests of industry and commerce were taken into account, dispelling the doubts of merchants. The merchants saw clearly that the struggle was against big traitors and evil bullies, breaking the concerns of not daring to let go of business in the past due to listening to rumors from secret agents. The boss of Senji Tea Shop recently took a trip to Tianjin, and his capital of 100,000 yuan earned a profit of 110,000 yuan. He regretted and said, "In the past, I suffered from not believing in the policy. If I had done this earlier, several million yuan would have been in my hands!" Therefore, he has changed from passive observation in the past to active business. (Xiang Ming)
    [Another dispatch] The anti-traitor anger of the Third District of Linqing, with more than 80 villages jointly struggling against the puppet district chief Qin Muxuan, puppet message deliverer Huang Zhenhe, and Huang Dechang, etc., fired the first shot of victory, and it is burning vigorously and universally everywhere. Within a month, not counting struggles within the scope of one village, 34 villages jointly struggled against traitors Zhang Meng and Zhang Zhonglin; 20 villages jointly struggled against enemy agent Song Changze; 17 villages jointly struggled against Song Changyou and Zhao Tingdong, company commanders of the puppet bandit Wu Lianjie's unit. The remaining 10 or 8 villages jointly overthrew puppet township chiefs Zhao Shuchen, He Ganheng, etc. Finally, they concentrated their efforts to attack the famous five major feudal fortresses: Siwa, Aoli, Suizhuang, Fangzhi, and Wu Liuzhuang. They destroyed the stubborn puppet feudal rule, uncovered the Kuomintang secret agents' sabotage conspiracy, liquidated the spoils looted by the traitors and stubborn elements, redressed the grievances accumulated by the masses for many years, and transformed the regimes of more than 60 villages. At present, this movement is nearing its end, and the villages are organizing and distributing the fruits of victory. More than 30 villages have already turned to the great production movement.

　　照顾工商业认识市民特点
　　临清市群运规模宏大
    【本报威县讯】七日以来，临清市展开大规模的反奸诉苦运动，斗垮了认贼作父压榨商民的伪华北营业所主任苏子明，及统治压榨群众多年的封建恶霸地主冀筱帆，市民们追回损失款一千六百万元，运动中有三千六百多市民参加了群众组织，并获得几点经验如下：
    （一）认识市民的特点，抓住其要求。城市平民的行业非常分散复杂，痛苦是多种多样的。如桃园街参加群众组织的一百一十四户中，即包括赤贫、贫民、摊贩、小商人、大把车子、泥工、鞋匠、小店员、长短工、礼拜堂佣人等多种人。他们身受过国民党政府、日寇、奸伪及恶霸地主的重要统治压榨，生活穷困不堪，吃了上顿找下顿，我们要仔细调查研究，深入发现他们的痛苦，大胆让他们起来。在运动过程中照顾其生活困难，少开大会，利用晚上开会和经济上帮助等。
    （二）临清市过去的奸伪人员特别多，但大部分都是为生活所迫的平民。因而除对少数罪大恶极、死心塌地的大汉奸恶霸予以严惩外，一般的都教育其悔过自新。这次运动时，首先几个人为我教育所感动，坦白悔过取得了群众的宽大，恢复了公民权，在他们的影响下立即有二十多个自新了，并有的已找到适当职业。
    （三）在反奸清算运动中，照顾了工商业利益，打破了商人的疑虑。商人们看清了斗争的是大汉奸、恶霸，打破了过去由于听了特务造谣而不敢放手营业的顾虑。森记茶店老板，最近去天津跑了一趟，十万元本钱即赚了十一万利，他后悔的说：“过去吃了不相信政策的亏，如早这样作，几百万元已经到了手了！”所以他从过去的消极观望转为积极营业。（向明）
    【又讯】临清三区的反奸怒火，以八十余村联合斗争伪区长秦睦轩、伪传达长黄镇河及黄德昌等，打响了胜利的第一炮，并在各地轰轰烈烈地普遍燃烧起来。一月内，除一村范围的斗争不计外，有三十四村联合斗争汉奸张猛、张仲林；二十村联合斗争敌特宋长泽；十七村联合斗争伪匪吴连杰部连长宋长友、赵廷栋。其余十村八村联合斗倒的，有伪大乡长赵梳臣、何干亨等。最后并集中力量，攻下著名的五大封建堡垒：司洼、凹里、随庄、方治与吴刘庄。摧毁了顽伪封建统治，破获了国民党特务的破坏阴谋，清算了奸顽们所掠赃物，申雪了群众多年积冤，改造了六十多村政权。目下这一运动已近结束，各村正整理组织，分配果实。并已有三十余村转入大生产运动。
