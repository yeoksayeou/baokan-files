Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. The key points of the draft peace treaties regarding Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland from the Foreign Ministers' Meeting have been published as follows:

    Draft Peace Treaty with Italy

    Regarding the borders between Italy and Trieste, it is stipulated that Italy should cede to Yugoslavia all territories east of the French-proposed line, as well as several islands in the Trieste region of the Adriatic coast. The Free Territory of Trieste should continue within the Italian borders of the French-proposed line (note: incomplete here). France will obtain five small pieces of territory currently within Italy along the French-Italian border; however, Italy can obtain access to hydroelectric plants in the Alps region it lost. Italy must cede all sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, and it is stipulated that these islands must remain demilitarized forever. The transfer of the islands will be determined by the Anglo-Greek Agreement. British troops on the islands will withdraw within ninety days after the treaty comes into effect.

    Italy relinquishes all rights to its African possessions (including Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland). These possessions should temporarily maintain their original status until the four powers jointly make a final decision. Italy respects the sovereignty of Albania and Abyssinia and renounces its special interests or influence in both countries. Italy relinquishes all its interests and privileges in China under the 1901 Peking Treaty, and it is stipulated that Italy abolishes the treaty of the Italian concession in Tianjin and renounces its rights in the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements. Italy must deliver goods worth 100 million US dollars to the Soviet Union within six years, but existing industrial production can be delivered in the first two years. The treaty includes notes on the compensation claims of France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, and Abyssinia, which will be considered by the peace conference currently held in Paris. The treaty stipulates that the quantity and type of compensation goods must be limited by the Italo-Soviet agreement. The method of selection should be based on the principle of not hindering Italy's economic reconstruction and avoiding increasing debts to other countries.

    The size of the Italian army is limited to 185,000 men, and the gendarmerie to 65,000 men. The Italian navy should be 67,500 tons, plus the old battleships Doria and Duilio. Submarines are not allowed. The air force is limited to 200 fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and 150 transport and training aircraft. Before Italy concludes a commercial treaty or agreement with the United Nations, it should grant each United Nation the following treatment for eighteen months after the establishment of the peace treaty, and each United Nation should also grant Italy reciprocal treatment. That is, regarding tariffs on imports and exports and domestic taxation on imported goods, Italy should grant each United Nation unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. In all other respects, Italy shall not discriminate against the entry or exit of goods from any territory of any United Nation compared to other United Nations or other foreign countries. Nationals of any United Nation should be granted national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment.

    Draft Peace Treaty with Romania

    The borders of Romania should be based on the borders as of January 1, 1941. The Romanian-Hungarian border as of January 1, 1938, should be restored. The Soviet-Romanian border should be determined according to the Soviet-Romanian agreement of June 28, 1940, and the Soviet-Czech agreement of August 29, 1945. In accordance with the armistice agreement, Romania has taken measures to release all people imprisoned due to engaging in activities supporting the United Nations or sympathizing with the United Nations or for other racial reasons, regardless of nationality or ethnicity, and to abolish all discriminatory laws, ensure the completion of these measures, and refrain from taking any similar actions in the future. Like Italy, Romania should also guarantee to capture those accused of wartime treason or collaboration with the enemy and should provide evidence. Romania guarantees to recognize the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, as well as the agreements or measures reached in the past and future with Germany, Austria, and Japan to restore peace, which have full effect. The maintenance of land, sea, and air force armaments and defenses should be strictly limited to addressing domestic incidents and border defense tasks. Romania may have an army with a total strength of 120,000 men (including border guards), and 5,000 anti-aircraft guns and cannons. The navy is allowed 5,000 men, and warships are allowed 15,000 tons. The air force (including the air force belonging to the navy) is allowed 150 aircraft, with a total of 8,000 personnel. Romania must not possess or acquire aircraft whose design is primarily for bombing. All Allied forces should withdraw from Romania within ninety days after the treaty comes into effect, but the Soviet Union has the right to retain part of its troops in Romanian territory to maintain the transportation lines of the Red Army in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria. Due to Romania's military actions and the damage suffered by the Soviet Union due to the Romanian occupation of Soviet territory, Romania should pay compensation. However, in view of Romania's war against Germany, it is agreed to make only partial compensation, that is, reparations of 300 million US dollars, to be paid off in eight years.

    Draft Peace Treaty with Bulgaria

    The borders of Bulgaria should be based on its borders as of January 1, 1941. The part of this document concerning the Greek-Bulgarian border is temporary until Greece submits its opinions to the peace conference or the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Bulgaria may have an army with a total of 55,000 men (including border guards), 1,800 anti-aircraft guns, and 7,250 tons of warships. The air force (including naval aircraft) may have 90 aircraft, of which no more than 70 should be fighter-type aircraft, and the air force personnel should be 5,200. Bulgaria must not possess aircraft whose design is primarily for bombing. The damages suffered by Yugoslavia and Greece will be compensated by Bulgaria, but in view of Bulgaria's war against Germany, only partial compensation will be made.

    Draft Peace Treaty with Hungary

    The borders of Hungary with Austria and Yugoslavia should be based on the borders as of January 1, 1938. The Vienna Decision of August 30, 1940, is declared null and void, and the Hungarian-Romanian border of January 1, 1938, is restored. The border between Hungary and the Soviet Union, starting from the common intersection point of the two countries and Czechoslovakia, is established along the former Hungarian-Czech border of January 1, 1938. Hungary may have an army (including border guards and inland river fleet personnel) with a total of 65,000 men, and an air force of 90 aircraft, of which no more than 70 should be combat aircraft, and an air force personnel of 5,000. Hungary must not have aircraft designed primarily for bombing. The damages it caused to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia will be compensated by Hungary, but in view of Hungary's war against Germany, only partial compensation will be made, that is, reparations of 300 million US dollars, of which two-thirds goes to the Soviet Union.

    Draft Peace Treaty with Finland

    The borders of Finland should be based on its borders as of January 1, 1941, except that Finland recognizes the return of the Petsamo province to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union recognizes the relinquishment of its right to lease the Hanko Peninsula as stipulated in the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty of March 22, 1940. Finland recognizes the Soviet Union's right to use territory and territorial waters in the Porkkala-Udd area to establish a Soviet naval base for a term of 50 years, with an annual rent of 5 million Finnish marks. Finland may have an army of 34,400 men, a navy of 4,500 men, warships of 10,000 tons, and an air force (including naval aircraft) of 60 aircraft, with a total personnel of 3,000. Finland must not have aircraft designed primarily for bombing. The damages caused to the Soviet Union should be compensated by Finland, but in view of Finland's declaration of war against Germany and its assistance in expelling German troops from Finland, only partial compensation will be made, that is, compensation totaling 300 million US dollars, to be paid in goods over eight years. Finland recognizes the Soviet Union's right to confiscate all German property within Finnish territory, to be transferred to the Soviet Union by the German Property Control Committee.

    All treaties contain the following clauses: the countries concerned will guarantee that all people under their jurisdiction, regardless of race, gender, language, or religion, enjoy human rights and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, publication, religious belief, political belief, and assembly.

    All treaties have provisions stipulating that within eighteen months after the treaty comes into effect, the ambassadors, ministers, or heads of missions of the relevant powers will represent the Allied and United Nations to manage all matters concerning the implementation and interpretation of the treaty.

    All treaties include provisions similar to Article 13 of the Peace Treaty with Italy, namely regarding the handling of war criminals and supporters of fascism, the demobilization of troops exceeding the recognized military strength, the control of standing and war materials, and general economic clauses.
