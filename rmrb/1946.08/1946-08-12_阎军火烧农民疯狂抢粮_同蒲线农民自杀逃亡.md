　　Yan's Army Burns, Farmers Desperately Grab Grain
    Farmers Along the Tongpu Railway Commit Suicide and Flee
    [Report from this newspaper in Yangcheng] In order to supply military grain for the civil war, Yan Xishan's army is frantically seizing grain in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, Qidong, Zhaocheng, Linfen, Xiangling and other counties along the Tongpu Railway. Since the beginning of last month, Yan's army has been forcibly collecting the fourth batch of military grain after the wheat harvest. Countless farmers have been forced to flee or even commit suicide. Zhang Kuifu, a farmer in Beiying Village, Hongtong, committed suicide on the evening of the 6th of last month by hacking his daughter-in-law to death with a kitchen knife and then jumping into a well after failing to hand over three stones and one dou of wheat. Along the Tongpu Railway, Yan Xishan has openly issued orders to seize grain. On the 22nd, the "Love the Country Corps" of the 66th Division of Yan's army stationed in Xiangling held a second grain grabbing meeting, and local grain prices immediately tripled. The 37th Division of Yan's army that invaded the Dongquan area of Pingyao has seized more than 3,000 stones of grain from the masses in the past week. On the 4th, more than 300 soldiers of the 44th Division of Yan's army seized 40 stones of grain from farmers in Yangzao Village, Huoxian County, in one instance. The family of Niu Yongkui alone had 15 stones of wheat seized. During the grain grabbing, this unit of Yan's army discovered a hidden grain cellar with more than 20 farmers taking refuge inside. In addition to seizing all 57 stones of grain, Yan's army set fire to the cellar, burning all the farmers inside to death. Currently, the people in the Yan army's controlled areas are extremely panicked and are fleeing to the Liberated Areas to make a living. The Hongtong Democratic Government has officially established a resettlement committee to prepare land and grain to help the refugees settle down and resume production.

　　阎军火烧农民疯狂抢粮            
    同蒲线农民自杀逃亡
    【本报阳城讯】为供应内战军粮，阎锡山军正在同蒲沿线的平遥、介休，灵石、霍县、琪洞、赵城、临汾、襄陵等县，大肆抢粮。从上月初起，阎军即强征麦收后第四次军粮。无数农民纷纷被迫外逃，甚至自杀。洪洞北营村农民张奎福，因交不出三石一斗小麦，遂于上月六日晚，用菜刀砍死其媳妇，自己跳井自杀。在同蒲沿线，阎锡山已公开下命令抢粮。二十二日及驻襄陵之阎军六十六师“爱乡团”召开了第二次抢粮会议，当地粮价立即高涨三倍。侵入平遥东泉地区之阎军三十七师，一周以来，已抢去群众粮食三千余石，四日，阎军四十四师三百余人，在霍县杨枣村一次即抢去农民粮食四十石，仅牛永奎一家，被抢麦子即达十五石。在抢粮中该部阎军发现一藏粮窑洞内有廿余位农民避难，阎军除将粮食五十七石全部抢走外，并用火焚烧，将洞内农民全部烧死。现阎军统治区人民恐慌异常，纷纷逃来解放区谋生，我洪洞民主政府正式成立安抚委员会，筹备土地粮食，给逃出难民安家生产。
