Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: This year, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has enjoyed favorable weather, truly embodying the image of a bountiful harvest with "wind every five days and rain every ten days." Standing on the high peak outside Yanchuan City, forty miles from the Yellow River in the eastern part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, one can see at a glance that on every mountain, fields of autumn crops sway in the wind like waves, and the 60,000 mu of cotton appear even more lush and lovely. Although a layer of dry heat arose not long ago, it has now been completely eradicated by the incessant rains, to the delight of the cotton farmers. Under the specific leadership and organization of all county-level cadres dispatched by the county committee and county government, the county's 394 mutual aid teams and 104 work teams are gradually transitioning into piece-rate mutual aid work teams. The eleven mutual aid work teams in the two townships of the urban area have all transitioned to piece-rate. Currently, men, women, and children can be seen everywhere in the cotton fields. Zhao Shangming from the Sixth Township of the urban area, leads his wife in piece-rate work under the scorching midday sun. When passersby advise them to work later in the day, he enthusiastically says, "No, the cotton grows better when we work piece-rate in the morning."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: The Zhongliu large sluice gate on the Yalu River, irrigating more than 30,000 mu of paddy fields, suffered damage after "August 15th" liberation. Before the democratic government was established, bad elements took advantage of the chaos to steal the wooden planks, and the sluice gate was also destroyed by the tides, directly impacting this year's production significantly. The Andong government allocated 100,000 yuan and sent personnel to assist in the repair. After two months of effort, it was completed last month, to the jubilation of the local people. A grand meeting was recently held to celebrate and thank the democratic government for its meritorious service in benefiting the people.

　　碧野连绵一片丰收气象
    陕甘宁边区风调雨顺       
    鸭绿江中流大水闸峻工
    【新华社延安二十八日电】今年陕甘宁边区风调雨顺，真所谓“五日一风，十日一雨”的丰收佳象。站在陕甘宁边区东部，相距黄河四十里的延川城外的高峰上，举目四瞩，但见各个山头上，一片秋禾迎风摇动，起伏似波，六万亩棉花更显得葱绿可爱。不久前虽曾起一层油旱，现已被霪雨全部杀灭，棉户莫不喜出望外，刻正在县委县府派出全体县级干部具体领导与组织下，全县三百九十四个变工队和一百零四个扎工队，逐渐转为打卡变扎工队了。城区二乡十一个变扎工队已全部转入打卡。目前棉田里处处是男人女人和娃娃，城区六乡赵尚明，在中午灼热的太阳下引着婆姨打卡，路过的人劝他们过了中午再打，他兴致勃勃的说：“不，上午打卡棉花长的好。”
    【新华社延安二十六日电】鸭绿江上灌溉三万余亩水田的中流大水闸，“八一五”解放后，民主政权尚未建立时，坏分子乘混乱中窃去木板，水闸亦被潮水冲毁，直接影响今年生产甚巨。安东政府拨款十万元，并派员协助修复，经过两月的努力，已于上月完成，当地人民无不欢庆，日前开大会庆祝，感谢民主政府为民兴利的功绩。
