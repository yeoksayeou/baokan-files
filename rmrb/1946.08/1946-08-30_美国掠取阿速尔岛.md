　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: New York dispatch: New York Times correspondent Beidilezhi reported from Lisbon that U.S. State Department representative Colbert and Major General Curt continued negotiations with Portugal, which began on July 14th, regarding the issue of the U.S. seeking a long-term lease of the Portuguese-owned Azores Islands air base. At the start of the negotiations, Portugal stated that the U.S. could use the base during wartime, but this still did not satisfy the U.S., because the Azores are a crucial link in a chain of bases in the Atlantic that the U.S. Air Force is attempting to acquire. The correspondent stated that Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar recently declared that Portugal will obviously be unable to maintain neutrality in the event of a new war. He also indicated that Portugal would be firmly within the U.S. sphere of influence.

    【新华社延安二十七日电】纽约讯：纽约时报驻里斯本记者卑德勒治报导称：美国务院代表科尔伯逊与柯特少将，和葡萄牙继续开始于七月十四日的谈判，即美国要求长期租借葡属阿速尔群岛航空根据地问题。谈判一开始，葡萄牙曾声明在战时美国可以使用该基地，但仍不能满足美国，因为阿速尔是美国空军企图取得大西洋中一连串基地中的重要一环。该记者称：最近葡总理萨拉柯曾宣称，发生新战争时，葡萄牙将显然不可能保持中立了。他还表示，葡萄牙会固定的处于美国势力范围之内。
