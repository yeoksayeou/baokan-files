Eulogy to Martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo
Fan Wenlan
Martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were brutally murdered by the traitorous and country-selling bandit Chiang Kai-shek. The blood of the two martyrs has been poured into the raging fire of the Chinese people's anti-American and anti-traitorous struggle, and the flames are even higher. Rest in peace, martyrs! Your righteous blood will definitely not be shed in vain.

For the past hundred years, the landlord and comprador classes have produced major traitors and country sellers, the most famous being Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Yuan Shikai, and Duan Qirui, who sold out almost all of China. But compared to Chiang Kai-shek's straightforward and thorough betrayal, they are insignificant and cannot be considered major traitors and bandits. The only one comparable is Wang Jingwei, a true pair of villainous brothers among the traitors!

Chiang Kai-shek attempted to seize all the fruits of the War of Resistance against Japan, to maintain his fascist dictatorship forever, and brazenly sold out everything in China to seek aid from American imperialism. He sold the sky, the sea, the inland rivers, and the customs. He sold everything he could sell. He still felt it was not enough, and he even sold the so-called "final decision-making power." In other words, he sold out the entire Chinese government, turning China into an American Philippines and the Chinese people into American black slaves, so that he could "honorably serve" as American imperialism's puppet emperor. This major traitor and bandit, who embodies the culmination of evil, thought he had succeeded and妄图迫促 attempted to force the CCP delegation to agree to his "honorable service." After running into a brick wall, he took out a so-called Marshal Ma trump card to scare people. This is truly a specimen of "not knowing the meaning of shame." If one were to try to find the word "shame" in his mind, it would be harder than撈月 retrieving the moon from the bottom of the sea, because he doesn't even have a shadow of shame, despite constantly shouting "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame."

The Americans and Chiang Kai-shek engaged in a transaction where neither side put up any capital. American imperialism sold surplus munitions that were about to be dumped into the sea, and Chiang Kai-shek sold the people's China and the Chinese people. After the deal was completed, American imperialism bought a loyal and filial puppet emperor, and Chiang Kai-shek bought a large number of killing weapons to suppress the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, especially to attack the peaceful and democratic liberated areas, attempting to bind 450 million people as slaves. Everyone knows that a transaction with no capital involved will definitely continue and will not stop automatically. That is to say, today's China is once again facing a "July 7th" crisis. If the people of the whole country do not summon the national spirit of resisting Japanese imperialism to resist American imperialism, and do not summon the strong force of punishing Wang Jingwei to punish Chiang Jingwei, then the blood shed in the eight years of the War of Resistance will have been shed in vain, and the souls of the millions of martyrs will become ghosts without offerings.

At such a critical moment, shouldn't every person save the country?

The Communist Party of China and the China Democratic League, representing the people of all classes, have taken on the great task of saving the country from peril. Chiang Kai-shek has not yet been able to fully carry out his treacherous schemes and do as he pleases, precisely because of the combined efforts of the CCP and the Democratic League to stop him.

Martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were important leaders of the Democratic League and important representatives of the people. They had every right to speak for the people. Chiang Kai-shek acted as an accomplice, betrayed the country completely, and they walked out of their studies to call for saving the country. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war and massacred soldiers and civilians. They advocated justice and strove for peace. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek practiced dictatorial rule and enslaved the people. They insisted on democracy and opposed dictatorship. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek destroyed the national economic lifeline and let American imperialism seize the lives of the Chinese people. They refused to be enslaved and demanded economic construction and the development of capitalism. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek forced and lured innocent youths to take the wrong path, to engage in the despicable profession of secret agents and become fascist lackeys. They could not bear to sit idly by, and they cried out loudly, pointing out the path to enlightenment and saving countless youths in thought. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? What the two martyrs did was a thousand times over undeserving of being killed. There is no doubt about that. Then, Chiang Kai-shek, who killed the two martyrs, deserves to be killed a thousand times over, also without a doubt.

Oh, two martyrs! Rest assured! The Chinese people will avenge you! The time for Chiang Kai-shek's self-destruction is not far off. He fans the flames of poison, and we will overcome him with righteousness; he employs tricks and schemes, and we will break him with truth; he surrenders to American imperialism, and we will defeat him with the vast people; he finally launches a war of national betrayal, seeking a slim chance of survival, and we will stop him with a war of national salvation. Our democratic forces are surging and more than sufficient. Chiang Kai-shek's schemes are exhausted, and he is taking risks, only able to make a desperate struggle. Who will be the final victor? Does it still need to be explained?

Sleep peacefully, two martyrs! You are democratic warriors, your reputations will be immortal, and at your graves, the people will erect monuments to the martyrs who died for their country, to commemorate you forever. Look! In the distance, there is a large pile of dung, with a stinking bone buried inside. In front of the dung heap, there is a stubborn stone, on which is written "Shanghai gangster, leader of the assassination squad, stock exchange speculator, special-grade warlord, number one traitor and country seller, head of the secret service, public enemy and tyrant, Chiang Kai-shek, puppet emperor of American imperialism, buried here." Not far away, another pile of dung buries Wang Jingwei, the puppet emperor of Japanese imperialism. These two piles of dung forever represent the crimes of the landlord and comprador classes. Sleep peacefully, two martyrs! You are forever worthy of pride!

　　李公朴闻一多两烈士哀辞
    范文澜
    李公朴闻一多两烈士被汉奸卖国贼蒋介石惨杀了。两烈士的鲜血，灌注到中国人民反美帝反奸贼的猛火堆里，光焰更是万丈高了。两烈士瞑目吧！你们正义的鲜血，决不会白流的。
    近百年来，地主买办阶级里产生大汉奸卖国贼，最著名的如曾国藩、李鸿章、袁世凯、段祺瑞之流，把中国卖得差不多，但比之蒋介石那样干脆而彻底的出卖，却是小巫见大巫，反而算不得大奸大贼了。可以相比的只有汪精卫，好一对奸贼群中的难兄难弟！
    蒋介石企图掠夺抗日战争的全部果实，永远保持其法西斯独裁，悍然出卖中国的一切，向美帝求援。他把天空也卖了，把海面也卖了，把内河也卖了，把海关也卖了，凡可以卖的都卖了。他还觉得不够，还出卖所谓“最后决定权”。换句话说，就是出卖中国的全部政权，使中国变成美帝的菲律滨，使中国人民变成美帝的黑奴，他自己因此“荣任”美帝的儿皇帝。这个集罪恶之大成的大奸大贼，自以为得计，妄图迫促中共代表团同意他的“荣任”，碰了大钉子以后，拿出一张所谓马帅的王牌来吓人。这真是“不知人间有羞耻事”的标本，如果想在他的头脑里找出一个耻字，那比水底捞月还难，因为耻的影子他也没有，不管他经常大叫特叫“礼义廉耻”。
    美蒋进行买卖，双方都不掏本钱。美帝出卖的是准备投海的剩余军火，蒋介石出卖的是人民的中国和中国的人民。买卖成交以后，美帝买得忠孝双全的儿皇帝一个，蒋介石买得大批杀人凶器，用来镇压蒋家统治区的人民，特别是进攻和平民主的解放区，企图捆缚一万万四千万人民做奴隶。谁也知道，不掏本钱的买卖，一定要继续下去，不会自动停止的。那就是说，今天的中国，又一次面临“七七”危机，全国人民不拿出反抗日帝的民族精神来反抗美帝，不拿出膺惩汪精卫的坚强力量来膺惩蒋精卫，那么，八年抗日的鲜血将成空流，千百万殉国英魂将成不血食之鬼。
    在这样严重的关头，每一个人民是不是应该救国呢？
    中国共产党、中国民主同盟代表全国各阶层人民，担当起挽救危亡的大任。蒋介石至今还不能售其奸计，为所欲为，就是依靠中共、民盟的合力阻止。
    李公朴闻一多两烈士是民盟重要负责人，也是人民的重要代表人，他们有完全权利替人民讲话。蒋介石为虎作伥，彻底卖国，他们走出书房，号呼救国，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石发动内战，屠杀军民，他们主张正义，力争和平，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石独夫专政，奴役人民，他们坚持民主，反对独裁，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石断送全国经济命脉，让美帝抓住中国人民的生命，他们拒绝奴化，要求经济建设，发展资本主义，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石迫诱无辜青年，走入邪路，执行特务贱业，充当法西斯走狗，他们不忍坐视，大声疾呼，指示光明大道，在思想上拯救了无数青年，这是该杀的事么？两烈士所做所为，千不该杀万不该杀，是毫无疑问的，那么，杀两烈士的蒋介石，千该杀万该杀，也是毫无疑问的了。
    两烈士呵！你们安心吧！中国人民会替你们报仇雪恨的！蒋介石自毙的时期不远了。他煽毒焰，我们以正义克之，他施鬼蜮，我们以真理破之；他投美帝，我们以广大人民胜之；他最后发动卖国战，寻求万一的活路，我们以救国战制止之。我们民主力量声势蓬勃，沛然有余，蒋介石计穷智竭，挺而走险，只能作绝望的挣扎，谁是最后胜利者，难道还要说明么？
    两烈士安睡吧！你们是民主战士，你们的名誉将永垂不朽，你们的墓前，人民要树立殉国烈士之碑，永远纪念你们。看吧！你们的遥远处，有一大堆粪土，里面埋着一副臭骨头，粪土堆前一块顽石，上面写着“上海青皮、暗杀队队长、交易所投机商人、特等军阀、头号汉奸卖国贼、特务总头子、民贼独夫、美帝儿皇帝蒋介石埋尸处”。相距不远，另一粪土堆埋着日帝儿皇帝汪精卫。这两堆粪土，永远表示地主买办阶级的罪恶。两烈士安睡吧！你们是永远值得骄傲的！
