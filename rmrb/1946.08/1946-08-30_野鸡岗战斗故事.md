　　Battle Story of Yejigang
　　　　Wang Huaiyu, Company Commander, Fought Bravely

　　During the counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek troops at Yejigang Station, our Deputy Company Commander, Comrade Wang Huaiyu, personally led the assault team to attack the pillboxes, charging forward while throwing grenades, and successively took down several pillboxes. When they reached the last major pillbox, the enemy resisted fiercely. He personally led the engineers to plant explosives. In the darkness, it was difficult to see clearly. The first time, they found a hole and were about to place the explosives when a grenade was thrown out of the hole. The second time, they found another spot, but it turned out to be the enemy's machine gun firing port, and they were driven back again. The third time, they finally found the enemy's rifle firing port, planted the explosives, and collapsed half of the enemy's pillbox. The enemy continued to fire guns and throw grenades desperately. Comrade Wang Huaiyu, with great agility, felt his way along the base of the wall and approached the pillbox, throwing several volleys of grenades, which posed a serious threat to the enemy, and the enemy stopped firing. We took the opportunity to shout through the prisoners. At this time, Comrade Wang Huaiyu had already climbed onto the major pillbox, and the enemy all surrendered their weapons. He single-handedly carried down two machine guns.

　　　　Fellow Villagers Urge Each Other to Lay Down Their Arms

　　In the self-defense battle against Chiang Kai-shek's troops at Yejigang Station, when the battle began on the morning of the 11th, our army captured three pillboxes north of the road in one fell swoop, capturing Ge Jin, the captain of the security team, and more than twenty others. Yang Wanyu, the deputy captain of the security brigade, led his troops to stubbornly resist in the large pillbox south of the road. Comrade Zhou Desheng, the company commander of a certain company, discovered that Ge Jin was from Anhui, and Comrade Zhang Xiao discovered that another prisoner was from Shandong and a fellow villager. They used their fellow villager relationship to kindly explain the great righteousness to them. They were deeply moved and voluntarily followed our army to the pillbox south of the road to shout, denouncing the crimes of being used by Chiang Kai-shek to carry out a treasonous civil war, and persuading them to withdraw from the civil war and lay down their arms. At the same time, in light of their tragic treatment, they exposed Chiang Kai-shek's shady practices of excluding miscellaneous troops. The soldiers in the pillbox cried loudly when they heard this, and were unwilling to fight any longer. Yang Wanyu had no choice but to lay down his arms along with them. As a result, Yejigang Station was completely restored to freedom. Company Commander Zhou Desheng simply counted: In this battle, more than sixty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were tragically sacrificed for nothing, more than one hundred laid down their arms, and five machine guns and more than one hundred rifles were captured. The reactionary ringleader Chiang Kai-shek's Henan Security Regiment Second Regiment, Second Battalion, collapsed in this way.

　　野鸡岗战斗故事
          王怀玉连长奋不顾身
    反击野鸡岗车站蒋军时，我军副连长王怀玉同志，亲自带着突击组上去打碉堡，一面冲一面打手榴弹，一连突下了好几个碉堡。到最后一个大碉堡，敌人抵抗很凶，他又亲自带着工兵去安炸药。黑夜里看不很清，第一次找到一个洞，正要放炸药，不料洞里丢了一个手榴弹。第二次又找到一个地方，却是敌人的机枪枪眼，又被敌人打了回来。第三次才找到敌人步枪枪眼，安好炸药，把敌人碉堡炸坍了一半，敌人还拚命打枪，打手榴弹，王怀玉同志又很机动地沿着墙根摸过去接近了碉堡，一连打了好几排手榴弹，给了敌人严重威胁，敌人才停止打枪。我们利用俘虏乘机喊话，这时王怀玉同志已经上了大碉堡，敌人全部缴械，他一下扛了两挺机枪下来。
            同乡喊同乡放下武器
    在野鸡岗车站反击蒋军的自卫作战中，当十一日晨战斗开始，我军一举攻克路北三个碉堡，俘保安队中队长葛进等二十余人。保安大队副杨万玉，却带领所部坚守路南大碉堡顽抗。某连连长周德胜同志，发现葛进是安徽人，和他同乡张绡一同志发现另一个俘虏是山东人和他同乡，就以同乡关系，亲切地晓以大义，他们甚为感动，乃自动随我军到路南碉堡去喊话，痛陈受蒋介石利用进行卖国内战之罪行，劝他们退出内战放下武器，同时针对着他们悲楚的待遇，揭露蒋介石排斥杂牌的黑幕。碉堡里的士兵们听了大声痛哭起来，都不愿再打了，杨万玉只好跟着他们一齐放下武器，于是野鸡岗车站乃全部恢复自由，周德胜连长简单数了一下：这次战斗里，惨遭无谓牺牲的蒋军六十多名，放下武器的一百多，缴获机枪五挺，步枪一百多枝，反动头子蒋介石河南保安团第二团第二大队，就这样垮台了。
