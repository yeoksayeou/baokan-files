　　Suzhong Front Farmers and Militia

    Utilize Guiding to Capture Chiang's Troops
    [Huazhong Front, 23rd dispatch] During the battle east of Hai'an, when the 105th Brigade of Chiang's 49th Division was annihilated, a remnant of about twenty men, carrying seven light machine guns and rifles, fled from Libao, seizing a local farmer named Wang Laizi and forcing him to guide them to Hai'an. Wang claimed to be unfamiliar with the roads, and the Chiang soldiers allowed him to find a replacement along the way. Therefore, he decided to lead the Chiang soldiers to the assembly point of the New Yao Township militia cadres to find a solution. He deliberately took detours along small paths to make the Chiang soldiers lose their way. When he led them to the border of New Yao Township, they encountered Zhou Yuxing, the militia company commander of the township, and several others. Under Wang Laizi's prompting, they were seized by the Chiang soldiers to replace Wang as guides. They immediately led the group of Chiang soldiers to the vicinity of a certain regiment of the New Fourth Army, where all the men and weapons were captured.
