　　Springboard
　　——The Story of the People of Hongdong Participating in the War
　　Jin Sha
　　Sitting in front of the door, Li Yugui, with his gray hair, yellowish eyes, and withered hands, was even more deep in thought. He was thinking about one thing: from here to the west, crossing Fengbi to Yufeng Mountain, the county seat was about to be filled with the roar of cannons. Our people—the Eighth Route Army—were about to capture the city, rushing over the blockade ditch on springboards amidst the rain of bullets. Li Yugui smiled as he thought about it, then jumped up and left.
　　Li Yugui had more energy than usual, forgetting that he was a 66-year-old man. He walked around the village, then around outside the village, marking several large poplar trees in the river滩 as springboards for attacking the city. When our troops rushed over the large poplar springboards, only our troops could rush over the large poplar springboards. Every one who got through would make a flower bloom in our hearts—how glorious! Li Yugui returned home and found several familiar and reliable people to secretly discuss the matter of making springboards in a small house.
　　“This is a big deal. If we make springboards, our people will be able to rush over them and capture the city.”
　　“Right! We have to work on it day and night.”
　　Li Yugui said with a smile, "This matter must be kept secret, lest Zhang Conglong find out and be prepared."
　　"Right, it can't be. From parents to wives and daughters, absolutely no one is allowed to tell the truth."
　　Everyone took an oath voluntarily.
　　At dusk, nine dark shadows jumped over the ditch and crossed the 河滩. Saws rang out on the large poplar trees, "刺啊擦啊" (ci a ca a - onomatopoeia for sawing). Someone constantly looked east and west. The sound of the saws went from slow to fast, from fast to tight. Nine people's hearts were set on sawing down twenty-four large trees with one saw. Then with axes, they made twelve springboards, so that our people could rush over the springboards and take the city.
　　It was midnight, and the dew had already fallen, wetting their pants halfway up. Li Yugui was, after all, getting old and also sick, so he felt a little chilly, but he stretched out his arms, stuck out his belly, supported his waist, and exerted himself like everyone else, trying to stop the chills in his body. Someone noticed and said:
　　"You rest for a while."
　　"What are you talking about!" Li Yugui deliberately exerted a lot of strength. But the humidity was too heavy, and Li Yugui's stomach ailment flared up again, and his heart gradually began to ache, but he gritted his teeth. Later it became more severe, his stomach swelled up like a drum, and the saw handle often bumped into this "drum", but he still exerted force, and even wanted to use the saw handle to press the drum down...
　　In one night, twenty trees were felled, then carried to the village, and they began making springboards during the day. Li Yugui's stomach ached more and more, and his belly grew larger and larger, but he still worked hard. When tired, or if someone shouted, "How's it going, Old Li?" Li Yugui would pat his belly and jump up, saying, "It doesn't hurt anymore, it doesn't hurt anymore, let's work!" In fact, his stomach was still aching intensely, and his belly was still painfully bloated.
　　The villagers were discussing their strange actions, but no one could find out that they were making springboards for attacking the city. Hundreds and thousands of people would pass over the springboards and capture the city.
　　As darkness fell, our troops passed through the village. The twelve springboards had already been made, and some were carried to the roadside. They seemed to be saying to the troops, "Look, our springboards are made, go over them!"

　　跳板
　　——洪洞人民参战故事
　　金沙
    坐在门前的李玉贵，灰白的头发，带黄的眼睛，枯瘦的双手，更加重了他的沉思。他在思想着一件事：从这里往西，穿过冯壁到玉峰山，县城将要炮火连天，咱们的人——八路军就要攻下城来，在弹雨中从跳板上冲过封锁沟。李玉贵想着笑了，又跳起来就走。
    李玉贵比平日有劲头了，忘记了他是六十六岁的老人，在村里转了一圈，又在村外转了一圈，在河滩里号下几棵大杨树作跳板攻城。当咱的队伍从大杨树跳板上冲过去，也只有咱们队伍能从大杨树跳板上冲过去。冲过一个，咱们心上开一朵花，这多光荣。李玉贵回到家里，就找了几个熟悉可靠的人，来在一间小房子里悄悄的商议做跳板的事。
    “这可是件大事情，作起跳板，咱的人就能从跳板上冲过去攻下城来。”
    “对！黑明白夜要干的。”
    李玉贵笑着说：“这件事情得保守秘密，怕张从龙知道了有准备。”
    “对，这还不能。上至父母下至妻女，一概不准说出实情。”
    所有的人自动发过誓。
    黄昏，九个黑影子跳过水沟，穿过河滩去，锯子就在大杨树上“刺啊擦啊”响起来。有人还不时的东照照西瞧瞧，锯子的声音由慢到快，由快到紧，九个人心要一锯子伐下二十四棵大树来。又一斧子作起十二个跳板来，让咱们的人从跳板上冲过去拿下城来。
    半夜了，露水已经下来，他们的裤子湿了半截。李玉贵毕竟上了年纪，又加有病，有些寒颤，但他把胳膊一伸，肚一伸，腰撑起来和别人一样的出力，竭力来制止身上的寒颤。有人发觉了说：
    “你歇一会。”
    “什么话！”李玉贵故意使出很大劲来。但是潮气太重，李玉贵的胃病又犯起来，心口渐渐痛起来，可是他咬着牙齿。后来更利害，他的肚子又胀大了，像一面鼓，锯子柄常常撞到这面“鼓”上，他仍旧用着力，还想依锯子柄把这面鼓压了下去。……
    锯了一夜二十棵树伐倒了，又抬到村里，白天就开始作跳板。李玉贵的胃越来越痛，肚子越来越大，但是还一样出力干。在疲乏时候，或有人喊一声“老李怎么样？”李玉贵就把肚子一拍跳起来说：“不痛了，不痛了，来干！”其实胃还在剧烈的痛着，肚子还胀的难受。
    村里人在议论着他们奇怪的行动，可是没有人能问出来是在作攻城的跳板。将有整百整千人从跳板上过去，攻下城来。
    将黑的时候，咱们的队伍从村子经过，十二个跳板已经作起，有的抬在路边。他们好像向队伍说：“你看，咱们的跳板作起了，你们冲过去吧！”
