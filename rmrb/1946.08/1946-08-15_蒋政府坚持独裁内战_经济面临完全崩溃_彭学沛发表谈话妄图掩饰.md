Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 12th: Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement on the 10th, stating: "Regarding the economic situation, if a complete collapse is to be avoided, immediate solutions must be sought." After this statement was released, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda for the Kuomintang, immediately issued a statement in Shanghai, saying: "Recently, our country's financial and economic situation has gradually improved," "This year, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces have all reported bumper harvests, and grain and commodity prices have fallen."

Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: The Kuomintang authorities, who persist in the civil war, are facing the "complete collapse" of the "economic situation." This truth has even been acknowledged by Marshall and Stuart. The "complete collapse" facing the "economic situation" is an important factor in the inevitable and disastrous defeat of the Kuomintang authorities' policy of civil war. Peng Xuepei's statement is intended to conceal the fatal wound on the warmongers, but the facts cannot be concealed. This year's summer harvest in Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces yielded only 30% of the normal unit area output. In Hunan, "even the planted land is suffering because the disaster victims are not well-fed and have no strength to water, weed, or fertilize, leaving it to grow by relying on the heavens. Therefore, the actual income will be difficult to reach 60%." (Reported by a special correspondent of the Ta Kung Pao in mid-July). According to exaggerated statistics from the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute, the early-season harvest in Sichuan was only around 50% of the normal yield for various crops, and the actual situation was even more serious than the above figures. Large areas of cultivated land in various provinces have been abandoned. According to newspaper reports, 65% of the cultivated land in Jiangxi province was abandoned in the first half of this year, more than one-third in Hunan, one-third in Anhui, one-quarter in Henan, 60% in northern Hubei, one-quarter in southern Hubei (Liupu area), and more than three-quarters in northern Guangxi. In Guangdong, Gaoyao in Xijiang is the worst, with abandoned land reaching 60%. Therefore, the total agricultural output of each province this season is much smaller than the harvest ratio. The "decline in grain prices" mentioned by Peng is only a phenomenon in some areas, and the decline is minimal. Moreover, every year when the harvest season arrives, grain prices temporarily fall, and bureaucratic capital buys up agricultural products at low prices, but in an instant, grain prices soar again, and the peasants have no grain left. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek government is vigorously implementing requisitioning and borrowing of grain, as well as allocating military grain, which will further promote severe famine. As of July, incidents of starving people抢米(qiang mi - to rob rice) had occurred successively in Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces, and people's uprisings were rampant in northern Sichuan. The true situation of the rural "bumper harvest" mentioned by Peng Xuepei is like this.

Regarding the financial situation of the Kuomintang government, the average monthly expenditure for the first five months of this year exceeded 50 million yuan, and the average monthly expenditure for the next seven months reached 100 million yuan. As the civil war continues to expand, the deficit will become larger. Only by printing more banknotes can more malignant inflation be caused (the current amount of paper money issued has exceeded 1,500 times the pre-war level), making it even more impossible for people of all classes to live, and even government employees are starving. Their strikes have spread to thirteen provinces. In the Anhui provincial government, only "Chairman" Li Pinxian did not participate in the strike of government employees.

The result of the Kuomintang's dictatorial and civil war policy is that, apart from a small group of big bureaucratic compradors and secret service chiefs, everyone else is threatened with starvation. To save the Kuomintang-controlled area from the danger of complete economic collapse, the people of the whole country must work together to smash the Chiang Kai-shek government's policy of civil war and dictatorship.

　　蒋政府坚持独裁内战  
    经济面临完全崩溃            
    彭学沛发表谈话妄图掩饰
    【新华社延安十二日电】马歇尔、司徒雷登十日下午联合声明称：“就经济情势方面，如欲避免完全崩溃，须立谋立即之解决。”这声明发表后，国民党中宣部长彭学沛立即在沪发表谈话谓：“最近我国之财政经济情况已渐入佳境”，“今年江西、四川、湖南、各省均称丰收，粮价物价下跌”。
    新华社记者评称：坚持内战的国民党当局，面临着“经济情况”的“完全崩溃”，这一真理连马歇尔和司徒雷登也不得不承认。“经济情况”之面临“完全崩溃”，是国民党当局内战政策必然惨败之一个重要因素。彭学沛的谈话就是为掩饰好战派身上的致命伤，但是事实是掩饰不了的。今年夏收，河南、广东、广西等省的单位面积产量均不及常年的三成，湖南“即使已播种的地，也因灾民食不饱无力浇水锄草施肥，任其靠天滋长，故实际收入甚难达六成。”（七月中大公报特派员报导）四川早季收成，即据四川农业改进所的夸大统计，各项作物的收成也不过常年的百分之五十上下，而且实际情形比上述数字还要严重的多。各省耕地已有大量抛荒，据报章披露，江西全省今年上半年耕地抛荒百分之六十五，湖南三分之一以上，安徽三分之一，河南四分之一，鄂北百分之六十，鄂南（柳蒲折）四分之一，广西北部四分之三以上，广东以西江高要为最，荒地达百分之六十。因此各省今年一季农产总量比较收成比例还要小得很多。彭氏所说的“粮价下跌”只是部分地区的现象，跌数也极微，而且每年时届收成，粮价一时下跌，官僚资本以低价收括农产，但一转瞬间粮价又飞涨，而农民已粒米无存。加以蒋介石政府正厉行征实征借及摊派军粮，更将促进了严重的饥荒。迄七月份止，饥民抢米事件在湖南、广东、广西、福建、浙江、江苏等省相继发生，四川北部民变蜂起。彭学沛所说的农村“丰收”其真情就是如此。
    关于国民党政府的财政状况，今年头五月的开支平均每个月超过五千万万元，后七个月的每月平均支出数达一万万万元，内战继续扩大，则赤字越大，只有印发更多的钞票造成更恶性的通货膨涨（现在纸币发行数额已超过抗战前一千五百倍），使各阶层人民更加无法生活，连政府公务员也都饿肚子。他们的罢工已遍及十三省，安徽省政府公务员罢工，没有参加的只剩“主席”李品仙一个人。
    国民党的独裁内战政策的结果，就是除了一小群大官僚买办和特务头子以外，其余的人都要遭受饿死的威胁。要挽救国民党统治区经济完全崩溃的危险，只有全国人民一致努力，粉碎蒋介石政府的内战独裁政策。
