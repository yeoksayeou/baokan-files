Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Paris dispatch: The Paris Peace Conference has entered the stage of subcommittee activities. Yesterday was devoted to subcommittee meetings, and the plenary session was suspended. Ten subcommittees have been established one after another: namely, the Italian Political and Territorial Committee, the Italian Economic and Financial Committee, the Romanian Political and Territorial Committee, the Bulgarian Political and Territorial Committee, the Hungarian Political and Territorial Committee, the Finnish Political and Territorial Committee, the Romanian-Bulgarian-Hungarian-Finnish Economic and Financial Committee, the Italian-Romanian-Bulgarian-Hungarian-Finnish Military Committee, the Legal Drafting Committee, and the General Issues Committee.

The agenda of each subcommittee for the past few days has been limited to procedural matters. The Italian-Romanian-Bulgarian-Hungarian-Finnish Military Committee has elected Polish representative Colonel Nazkowski as chairman and Kuomintang government representative Fu Bingchang as vice chairman. The Romanian-Bulgarian-Hungarian-Finnish Economic and Financial Committee has also elected Czech representative Korba as chairman and Australian representative Evatt as vice chairman. The proposer of motions is the Soviet representative. The General Issues Committee elected Norwegian representative Lange as chairman and Polish representative Wierzbowski as vice chairman. The Legal Drafting Committee is chaired by Canadian representative Claxton, with a representative from Byelorussia as vice chairman. Dutch representative François serves as the proposer of motions.

The most important subcommittee, the Italian Political and Territorial Committee, held its second meeting yesterday. The proposer of motions for this committee is the New Zealand representative. Previous disputes on this issue have been resolved, and the procedural disputes of the committee have also reached an agreement, that is, based on the procedure drafted by the Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, the main points are: first, to review the preamble and political and territorial clauses; second, to review the issue of Allied troop withdrawal; third, to resolve differences; and fourth, to address all the provisions of the treaty. The chairman of the committee, South African representative Eglan, proposed that the draft treaty must be submitted for discussion before midnight on the 20th of this month. The draft treaty should be discussed chapter by chapter and article by article, and the Italian delegation should prepare complete memorandums according to the different articles of the treaty. All the above proposals were unanimously adopted.

On several subcommittees related to the Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Finnish issues, the Soviet representatives proposed that only countries that actually fought against the Axis satellite states should have the right to vote. Some countries disagreed with this, and no decision was made. Due to the lack of housing and translators, no more than three subcommittees can meet simultaneously each day. The committees will meet in the morning and afternoon, and also hold sessions in the evening. The plenary session will resume this morning, with representatives from Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt, who have recently been invited to participate, expressing their opinions.
