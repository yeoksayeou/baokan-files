　　Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 20th: The Eighth Route Army in the Bohai area of Shandong, in coordination with the broad masses of militiamen, continuously counterattacked and harassed a main force unit of Jiang's army's Eighth Army, which had invaded and occupied Guangrao City, and recovered the city on the 13th. The Jiang army fled south in separate routes. Guangrao City was liberated from the enemy and puppet forces by the Eighth Route Army on August 13th last year, and was captured by Jiang's army this month on the 10th. After entering the city, the Jiang army looted wantonly, and within three days, plundered the people's property with up to five hundred carts, which were transported to Linzi. The residents of the city, who had been subjected to long-term devastation by the enemy and puppet forces during the War of Resistance and whose wounds had not yet healed, have suffered this catastrophe, and their future lives will be even more difficult. The democratic government is seeking relief.
    Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 21st: More than a thousand Jiang's puppet troops from Lincheng, an isolated stronghold on the Jinpu Railway, invaded eastward from the city on the morning of the 7th, occupying Dongcang, four miles northeast of the city, and raiding Xishan Bridge and other places north of the city, in order to coordinate with the offensive of Jiang's army's 97th Army in the Chuanjiao area on the Jinpu and Longhai lines. The Eighth Route Army, in coordination with the militiamen, fought a battle at Xishan Bridge, capturing alive more than two hundred Jiang soldiers, killing or wounding dozens of others, and seizing three artillery pieces and more than one hundred rifles. On the 10th, more than ten militiamen from the Sixth District of Lincheng sneaked into the vicinity of Lincheng Railway Station and laid several landmines. When a unit of Jiang's 33rd Division came out to harass, they stepped on them, and a company commander and several soldiers were killed. Another report: Wu Huawen's puppet troops, entrenched in Yanzhou, led more than two thousand troops on the 8th to invade the border of Zou County, but were repelled by more than two hundred local joint defense militiamen using guerrilla tactics.
