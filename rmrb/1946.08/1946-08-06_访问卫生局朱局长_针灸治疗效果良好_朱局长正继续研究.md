　　Visiting Director Zhu of the Health Bureau
    Acupuncture Treatment Shows Good Results
    Director Zhu Continues Research
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the 3rd, this reporter visited Comrade Zhu Lian, Director of the Border Region Health Bureau. She was busy diagnosing patients in a spacious and quiet courtyard, inquiring about their symptoms, and performing her famous acupuncture. She had been diligently and continuously working for seven or eight days in this lush green village during the muggy mid-summer season, having come from Handan. Sometimes, she meticulously diagnosed twelve or thirteen patients in one go. According to medical practice, a doctor's energy is usually not sufficient to meticulously diagnose ten people at once. The day before yesterday, she went to a neighboring village to see patients, working all day and rushing back at dusk. She caught a cold after getting drenched in a sudden rain shower while covered in sweat. After resting for half a day, she started busily receiving patients again. Clearly, she was somewhat thin and tired, but she was cheerfully persevering.
    The Health Bureau was established in the first month of the lunar year, and at that time, there was only Director Zhu. There were no doctors, pharmacists, or nurses. After many efforts, they managed to recruit seven or eight doctors, but the pharmacists and nurses were all trained in-house. They adopted a "little teacher" system, where doctors taught nurses, and nurses who learned the skills taught new nurses. Within half a year, they trained many cadres, and now they have four pharmacists and more than thirty nurses. Director Zhu said modestly: We haven't treated many patients. In half a year, we treated 5,787 people. This includes personnel from Party, government, and military organizations, as well as ordinary people, with the latter accounting for one-third of the total. Currently, medicines are very expensive. The Health Bureau provides free preferential treatment to many people. The actual drug fees collected were only 170,000 yuan, while the free medical care amounted to more than 610,000 yuan.
    "Prevention is more important than treatment." The Health Bureau has taken some active and effective steps. In the spring, they provided free smallpox vaccinations, vaccinating 4,500 people in April alone. Now, they are vaccinating people against cholera and typhoid. In July, 20,000 people were vaccinated in Handan City. Regarding other urban sanitation work, they are actively promoting it in cooperation with relevant departments. When the land reform teams went to the countryside, the Health Bureau sent two epidemic prevention and medical teams to work in Handan and Linzhang, and another one in Handan City. There are many patients in the countryside, and poor patients cannot afford medicine. Hearing that the medical teams provided free medical care, they brought the old and the young to seek treatment. A seventy-year-old woman said, "I have lived for seventy years and have never seen anything like this." Many grateful words reached the ears of the medical team comrades. "Serving the people" brought them the greatest comfort. Although the medical team comrades' lives were hard, their work was busy, and medicines were scarce, they were very excited in their busy work. Although they were small in number, they had treated 806 people in three weeks. A large part of them were cured by acupuncture.
    "What is the scientific basis of acupuncture?" Director Zhu said: "It is scientific, using stimulation of nerves to produce a kind of electrotherapy effect." She said: Acupuncture has a very fast effect and can cure many diseases that are difficult to cure with drugs. At the same time, it can considerably solve the difficulty of drug shortages. An old farmer in Linzhang suffered from esophageal stricture and vomited up food immediately after eating. He could not be cured for many years. The comrades of the medical team performed four acupuncture treatments, and he was able to eat, move, and work in the fields. Another old lady suffering from hemiplegia was also cured by the medical team with two acupuncture treatments. Director Zhu has accumulated considerable experience in experimenting with acupuncture for more than a year, and has also trained more than ten cadres who can perform acupuncture independently. She plans to continue her research and write articles on the theory and experience of acupuncture in the near future to promote this scientific Chinese ancient medical method.

　　访问卫生局朱局长
    针灸治疗效果良好
    朱局长正继续研究
    【本报特讯】三日，记者往访边区卫生局局长朱琏同志，她正在一个宽敞寂静的院子里忙着诊断，询问病人的症状，进行其有名的针灸。他在这溽热的中伏季节，由邯郸来到这个绿树荫浓的乡村中，已经紧张而持续的忙了七八天了。有时候精细的一口气诊断十二三个病人，按照医界惯例，一个医生的精力是不能一次精细的诊断十个人的。前天她去邻近一个村子看病，忙了整整一天，黄昏时匆匆赶回，出了满身大汗的身子淋了急雨，病了，休息半天，又开始忙碌的接待病人。显然她有些消瘦和疲倦，但是她在愉快的支持着。
    卫生局是正月成立的，当时只有朱局长一个人。医生、司药、护士都没有。经过多方努力，总算网罗邀聘了七八位医生，司药和护士却都是自己培养的。他们采取“小先生”制，医生教护士，学会了的护士教新来的护士，半年之间培养了不少干部，到现在已有四个司药，三十多个护士了。朱局长很谦逊的说：我们治的病不算多，半年的时间治了五千七百八十七个人。这里面包括党政军各机关和老百姓，后者占了总数的三分之一。现在药品很贵，卫生局把免费的优待给予很多人，实收的药费不过十七万，而免费的则达六十一万余元。
    “预防重于治疗”，卫生局采取了一些积极有效的步骤。在春天，他们为人免费种牛痘，只四月份就种了四千五百人，现在又在为人们注射霍乱、伤寒疫苗，七月份邯郸市注射了两万人。关于其他城市卫生工作，他们正协同有关方面积极推行。翻身队下乡的时候，卫生局派了两个防疫医疗队分到邯郸、临漳工作，还有一个在邯郸市。乡村病人很多，贫苦的病患者无力吃药，听说医疗队看病不要钱，都扶老携幼的跑去求医，七十岁的老婆婆说：“我活了七十岁没看见过。”许多感激的语言传到医疗队同志的耳朵里，“为群众服务”得到最大的安慰，医疗队的同志们生活虽苦、工作虽忙、药品虽然缺乏，但在忙碌中却非常兴奋，他们人数不多，在三个星期时间内却已经治疗了八百零六个人。其中有很大一部分是针灸治愈的。
    “针灸的科学性究竟怎么样呢？”朱局长说：“它是科学的，利用刺激神经，起一种电疗作用。”她说：针灸的效果极快，能治许多药物所难治愈的病，同时可以相当解决一些药品缺乏的困难。临漳有一老农，患食道窄狭病，吃了饭就原封吐出来，经年累月不能治好。医疗队的同志施行了四次针灸，他就能吃饭，能行动，而且能上地了。另有一位老太太患半身不遂，也由医疗队施行两次针灸治好了。朱局长在实验针灸一年多的时间中，曾积累了相当的经验，也培养了十多个干部，都能单独进行针灸了。她准备继续研究，并在最近写一些关于针灸的理论与经验的文章，以提倡这种科学化了的中国古医法。
