　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan held a special meeting on the 15th. The US representative, Acheson, attempted to undermine the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution of last December by proposing that the Allied Council for Japan be expanded from four to eleven countries, and that this be resolved at this special meeting. The Soviet representative, Derevyanko, strongly refuted this, pointing out that the US representative's move was an act of bad faith in violation of international agreements, and declared that the Allied Council for Japan had no right to discuss this issue, which should be submitted to the four governments for consultation. After Derevyanko's speech, Acheson tried to get the Kuomintang representative to support him, asking Zhu Shimin to state his position. Zhu hesitated for a long time, looking very embarrassed, and just chuckled repeatedly. The British representative, Ball, said he would not consider it. At this point, Acheson became angry and shouted, "The order of our meetings is often disrupted by a certain member state." The Soviet representative then rebuked him again, saying, "It is you, Mr. Acheson, who has often disrupted order in the past, and you are doing so again today."
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: A spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 13th, condemning the Yoshida Cabinet's land reform plan announced on the 11th, declaring that Yoshida's plan, under the guise of "land reform," is merely a continuation of the feudal landlords' exploitation. Yoshida's plan stipulates that Japanese farmers will have two and a half acres of cultivated land, which will not liberate Japan's impoverished small farmers. At the same time, Yoshida's plan stipulates that rent should account for 15 percent of the average annual harvest, which is incorrect and should be around 10 percent. (Note: Yoshida's plan was approved by MacArthur on the 12th.)

　　盟国对日委员会上
    美国破坏莫斯科决议
    日共谴责吉田内阁土地改革计划
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会于十五日举行特别会议，美代表艾契森企图破坏去年十二月莫斯科外长会议的决议，提出对日委员会由四国扩大为十一国组成，并且要在这次特别会议中解决。苏代表德勤维杨科即严加驳斥，指出美代表此举为背信弃义破坏国际和约的行动，并声明对日委员会中无权讨论此项问题，应提交四国政府磋商。德氏发言后，艾契森即想找国民党代表作声援，要朱世明表明态度，朱氏踌躇良久，窘态百出，连声呵呵而已。英代表鲍尔表示不加考虑。艾契森至此恼羞成怒，大叫道：“我们开会的秩序常被某一会员国破坏”。苏代表乃再加斥责道：“过去常破坏秩序的乃是你艾契森阁下，即今天亦然。”
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：日本共产党发言人于十三日发表谈话，谴责吉田内阁于十一日发表的土地改革计划，宣称：吉田的计划，是在“土地改革”的幌子下，继续保持封建地主的剥削而已。吉田计划规定日本农民获有两英亩半的耕地，是不能使日本赤贫的小农得到解放的，同时吉田的计划中规定佃租占每年平均收获量的百分之十五，是不对的，应该在百分之十左右。（按：吉田计划已于十二日得到麦克阿瑟的批准。）
