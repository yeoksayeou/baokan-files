Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Yesterday at 6 PM, over two thousand representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an held a memorial service for Mr. Tao Xingzhi at the Border Area Assembly Hall. The four walls of the hall were covered with inscriptions presented by various circles. The inscription by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, read "Mourn the Great People's Educator." A female worker, Li Shuying, wrote, "You live in the hearts of us workers." A group of elementary school students from Yan'an City wrote, "We will each commemorate you by teaching two farmers well enough that they can recognize two hundred characters." The chief officiants were Lin Boqu, Xie Juezai, Lu Dingyi, and Xu Teli, with Li Zhuoran, Liu @, and eleven others as assistant officiants. Mr. Zhang Zonglin reported on Mr. Tao's life and deeds. Chairman Lin spoke on behalf of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, saying, "Mr. Tao is a genius—a people's educator—produced in our disaster-ridden country in the last thirty years. This is the glory of the Chinese nation. His life and actions demonstrate his deep love for the broad masses of the people and his extreme hatred for fascist dictators. This is precisely the great spirit possessed by a generation of Chinese workers." Chairman Lin said, "The people of the entire border region will permanently commemorate Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Although he never came here, his cause has been put into practice here and has increased the welfare of the broad masses. To commemorate Mr. Tao, the Border Region Government has decided to rename Yan'an Middle School as Xingzhi Middle School and establish the Xingzhi Scholarship, hoping that Mr. Tao's educational ideas will soon be implemented throughout the country." Subsequently, Lu Dingyi spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (the full text of the speech is in another dispatch). When invited to speak, Xu Teli pointed out that Mr. Tao's academic thought started from China's reality. He placed the transformation of society first. He was a great thinker and outstanding people's educator in modern China. Ding Huashan, representative of the Yan'an branch of the Society of Life Education, and Xu Hanru, representative of the Yucai School of the Shanghai Gongxuetuan, spoke successively. Xu Hanru said, "Mr. Tao's death is a great sorrow for us children who have suffered hardships. In the Great Rear Area, it has made our classmates lose a protector of their body and mind. We must call on the youth of the liberated areas to come forward to support them and oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction and sabotage of Mr. Tao's cause."
    The meeting finally passed a resolution to organize the Tao Xingzhi Memorial Committee to handle research and other commemorative work. It is composed of ten people, including Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, Xu Teli, Xie Juezai, Li Zhuoran, He Liancheng, Jiang Longji, Ke Zhongping, Ma Jichuan, and Zhang Zonglin. The meeting passed a telegram informing the national cultural and educational circles, Mr. Tao's family, and his friends of all the decisions regarding the memorial, as well as the situation of the memorial meeting. It was also decided to exhibit the memorial inscriptions for two days, the twelfth and thirteenth.

    【新华社延安十二日电】昨日下午六时，延安各界代表二千余人于边参会礼堂举行陶行知先生追悼大会。礼堂四壁为各界所送之题字布满，中共中央委员会主席毛泽东题字为“痛悼伟大的人民教育家”，女工李淑英写着“你活在我们工人心里”，延市完小一群小学生写着“我们每个人要用教好两个农民认识两百字的成绩来纪念你”。主祭人为林伯渠、谢觉哉、陆定一、徐特立，陪祭人为李卓然、柳＠等十一人。张宗麟先生报告陶先生生平事略。林主席代表陕甘宁边区政府讲话，他说：“陶先生是在我们这个多灾多难的国家里近三十年来所产生出来的一个天才——人民教育家，这是中华民族的光荣，他的一生言行，表现在他对于广大的人民群众有着深厚的爱，而对于法西斯独裁者则极端痛恨。这正是中国一代工人所具备着的伟大精神。”林主席说：“全边区人民将永久纪念着陶行知先生，虽然他没有来过这里，但他的事业在这里得到实践，且曾为广大群众增加了福利。为纪念陶先生，边府已决定将延中改名为行知中学，设立行知奖学金，希望陶先生的教育思想不久的将来能在全国得到实行。”继由陆定一代表中共中央讲话（演词全文见另电）。徐特立在被邀讲话时，指出陶先生的学术思想，是从中国的实际出发的，他把改造社会放在第一位，他是近代中国的一个伟大的思想家和优秀的人民教育家。生活教育社延安分会代表丁华山、上海工学团育才学校的代表许翰如相继讲话，许翰如说：“陶先生的死，对我们受过苦难的孩子们是一个很大的悲痛，在大后方来说，更使我们的同学失去了一个心身的保护者。我们要号召解放区的青年起来支援他们，反对国民党反动派对于陶先生事业的摧残和破坏。”
    会议最后通过组织陶行知先生纪念委员会，以办理研究及其他纪念工作。由林伯渠、习仲勋、徐特立、谢觉哉、李卓然、贺连城、江隆基、柯仲平、马济川、张宗麟等十人组成，通过大会通电，将大会追悼情形及一切有关纪念之决定，告知全国文化教育界及陶先生家属与生前友好。并决定将追悼题词十二十三两日展览两天。
