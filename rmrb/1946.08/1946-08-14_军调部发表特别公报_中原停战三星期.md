　　Military Mediation Department Issues Special Communiqué
　　Ceasefire in the Central Plains for Three Weeks
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th】Beijing dispatch: The Executive Headquarters for Mediation issued the following special announcement on the Central Plains ceasefire issue on the 9th of this month: The three members of the Beijing Executive Headquarters telegraphed Cheng Qian, director of the Wuhan Group Camp, Liu Zhi, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang army in Nanyang, Sun Ting, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang army in Laohekou, Hu Zongnan, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang army in Xi'an, and General Li Xiannian of the Communist army, instructing them on the temporary ceasefire agreement for the troops of each general. The Kuomintang government and the Communist side have been asked to immediately notify the relevant generals at the front line of the agreement, and then the three members will decide when and where to settle General Li Xiannian's troops. The terms of the agreement are as follows: (1) Both sides declare a ceasefire from midnight on August 6, 1946, until August 26, 1946. (2) All Kuomintang troops currently pursuing General Li Xiannian's troops shall cease pursuit and withdraw twenty miles. (3) The Kuomintang and Communist armies shall cease fire on the western front, and both sides shall withdraw ten miles from their current positions, the Kuomintang army withdrawing ten miles to the west, and the New Fourth Army withdrawing ten miles to the east. (4) General Li Xiannian orders his troops to cease moving. (5) General Li Xiannian will send a representative to Xi'an to confer with the Ninth or Thirty-Second Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters. The representative will arrive in Xi'an before midnight on August 9, 1946. (6) General Li Xiannian's troops, scattered due to pursuit, may regroup, and the Kuomintang army shall guarantee their safe passage, pending the disposal of the three members. (7) The Thirty-Second Group will assist the Kuomintang government and the New Fourth Army troops in providing supplies and caring for the sick and wounded. (8) Copies of this agreement will be immediately delivered by special envoy to the relevant generals and sent to the Beijing Executive Headquarters and the Nanjing Three-Person Committee. (9) The Ninth Executive Group will designate an appropriate area for the New Fourth Army to be stationed, and all Kuomintang troops shall withdraw from that area. The Ninth Group will be responsible for adjusting the work in this area and will submit it to the higher authorities for approval. (10) The field commanders of all parties concerned shall write to the Thirty-Second Executive Group in Xi'an, stating that they have received this agreement and clearly expressing their approval or disapproval. This notification to the Thirty-Second Group shall be issued before midnight on August 9, 1946. (11) Whenever a Kuomintang or New Fourth Army field commander fails to comply with this agreement established by the Ninth and Thirty-Second Executive Groups, the Three-Person Committee and the Executive Headquarters shall be immediately notified so that necessary steps can be taken. This agreement shall not prejudice any agreement and instructions concerning fundamental principles previously or future published by the Beijing Executive Headquarters or the Nanjing Three-Person Committee. This agreement was reached by the Ninth Executive Group on July 27.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th】Xinhua News Agency reporter comments on the joint communiqué issued by the Beijing Military Mediation Department on the 9th of this month regarding the three-week ceasefire agreement on the Central Plains issue: Since June 26, when Chiang Kai-shek ordered the encirclement and annihilation of Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains, which failed, he issued another order in mid-July to pursue Li's breakthrough troops with infantry, preventing them from gaining a "foothold," instructing the air force to conduct reconnaissance and bombing along the way, and offering a reward of 3 million yuan for the capture of General Li Xiannian. Currently, in addition to the Chiang troops originally pursuing Li's troops, Hu Zongnan has transferred four divisions to block the troops that broke through to southern Shaanxi and is continuing to reinforce them. On the 4th of this month, Zhu Shaozhou, chairman of Shaanxi, stated: "Notify Li Xiannian himself and his subordinates to leave Shaanxi within a time limit," not allowing the troops to have a foothold. Since January, Chiang's side has successively violated the "Luoshan Agreement," the "Yingshan Agreement," and the "Hankou Agreement" of May 10, attacking our army in the Central Plains in violation of the agreement. In more than half a year, he has occupied almost all of the Central Plains liberated areas with a population of five million, so it is questionable whether Chiang's army will abide by the agreement this time. As long as Chiang's army stops attacking and stops reinforcing troops, the CCP will definitely firmly abide by the agreement.

    【新华社延安十一日电】新华社记者评北平军调部本月九日发表关于中原问题三周停战协定之联合公报：溯自六月二十六日，蒋介石手令一举包围歼灭中原李先念部未成，又于七月中旬再下手令对突围李部以步兵跟迹追击，不使其有“立足”机会，责令空军分路侦察轰炸，并悬赏三百万元捉拿李先念将军。目前除原追击李部之蒋军外，胡宗南已调四个师向突围至陕南部队阻击，并在继续增援中。本月四日，陕主席祝绍周称：“通知李先念本人及其部属，限期离开陕境”，不让部队有立锥之地。蒋方从一月起，已先后破坏“罗山协定”、“应山协定”及五月十日之“汉口协定”，违约进攻中原我军。半年余来，已将我五百万人口之中原解放区侵占殆尽，因此蒋军此次能否遵守协议颇成问题。只要蒋军停止进攻，停止增兵，中共是一定坚决遵守协议的。
