Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. Shanghai People's Representative, Director of Shangyuan Enterprise Company, and Chairman of Kaimeike Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhang Gangbo, recently published an article in a Shanghai newspaper entitled "National Wealth Concentrated in the Hands of a Few People," pointing out that bureaucratic warlords concentrated wealth in three steps after the "July 7th" Incident: "After the July 7th Incident, Chinese bureaucratic warlords used their power to dominate transportation agencies, monopolize commerce, and manipulate the market. They used the name of unified control to fill their own pockets with the people's manpower and material resources. This was the first step in transforming national wealth into private property." "The second step was that the Japanese invaders in the occupied areas robbed all materials from the people at the lowest prices and by coercive means, concentrating them in several large cities. In Shanghai alone, there were thousands of warehouses, each piled high like a mountain." Zhang also pointed out that the third part of the concentration was after the victory. He said: "Last September, when the Japanese invaders surrendered, the receiving personnel who came from all over the place saw warehouses full of materials in Shanghai, as well as high-rise buildings, factories, commercial banks, and automobiles and furniture transferred by the enemy and puppets. Everyone's eyes turned red, like hungry tigers pouncing on sheep. They robbed and stole openly and secretly, regardless of reputation or law, taking the initiative as the best strategy. This muddled account has been going on for almost a year, and the government has never made a public announcement. The large amount of wealth concentrated by the Japanese invaders was easily obtained by bureaucratic warlords. The people watched with cold eyes and called it 'plunderous seizure.'"

Zhang continued: "Bureaucratic capital has already formed its development route. First, it takes over private public opinion organs, cultural organs, stock exchanges, etc., which have a deep foundation in commerce, under the beautiful name of 'increasing shares,' but in reality, it is 'usurping the nest of the magpie.' Then, it classifies the enemy and puppet companies, commercial factories, and financial institutions with substantial content as 'state-owned,' and sells the dilapidated ones to merchants and civilians, luring people to take the bait. The war efforts of the factories in the rear were written off with one stroke and were not given relief. Even in order to find a way out, they did not hesitate to collude with imperialist financial capital, such as opening up inland river navigation rights and revising the Company Law, regardless of losing national sovereignty. As a result, cheap and high-quality American goods came like a landslide. This is how bureaucratic capital transforms into comprador capital, acting as the vanguard of imperialist economic aggression."

Zhang stated: "In short, national wealth has been concentrated in a few large cities, and the wealth in the cities is undoubtedly concentrated in the hands of a few bureaucratic warlords. Corruption, embezzlement, and malfeasance have reached the point of decay and collapse in every corner of the administrative and military institutions, just like the blood in the human body is drying up and concentrated in the head, turning into cerebral congestion. Is it dangerous or not?" Finally, Zhang believed: "The situation of wealth distribution in China can be said to be unparalleled in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The issue of redistribution is imminent." Regarding the distribution of wealth, he proposed three paths: "First, those who made a fortune from national disasters and the victory should quickly realize their mistakes and voluntarily take out 80% of their ill-gotten gains to relieve the refugees. This is the best policy, but it is also wishful thinking. Second, the government should promptly promulgate a heavy wealth tax policy to impose legal sanctions on them and force them to spit out all their illegal gains. This is a moderate policy, but with political power in their hands, it is like asking a tiger for its skin and will not become a reality. Therefore, it is inevitable to take the last path, which is when the people can no longer endure it, they will rise up in revolt and shed blood in revolution. This is of course the worst policy and should be avoided at all costs, but observing the authorities, I am afraid they will still take this path. They will not give up until they reach the Yellow River. It is truly hateful."

　　沪张纲伯氏著文痛斥国民党官僚资本应重新分配全国财富
    【新华社延安廿九日电】上海人民代表、上元企业公司董事、开美科药厂董事长张纲伯氏，顷在沪报发表“全国财富集中在少数人手里”一文，指出“七七”以后官僚军阀集中财富有三个步骤：“七七事变后，中国官僚军阀利用职权，霸持交通机关，垄断商业，操纵市场，样样假以统制名义，将人民的人力物力均饱入私囊，这是将国家财富化为私有的第一步集中。”“第二步是日寇在沦陷区，将所有物资用最低价格和强迫手段从人民手中劫夺而来，集中在几个大城市，仅上海一地就有数千个仓库，个个堆积如山。”张氏又指出第三部集中是在胜利以后，他说：“去年九月日寇投降，从天上地下来的接收人员，一到上海见了满仓库的物资，敌伪所移交的高楼大厦工厂商行以及汽车家具，五光十色，个个眼红，如饿虎扑羊，你抢我夺，明抢暗偷，不管名誉法律，先下手为强，这笔糊涂账时将一年，政府从未公开宣布，日寇集中之大量财富，遂为官僚军阀垂手而得，人民冷眼旁观，名之曰‘劫收’。”张氏接着又说：“官僚资本早已形成它的发展路线，首先是将民间舆论机关文化机关交易所等等，在商业有深厚基础者，美其名曰‘加股’，而实则为‘鹊巢鸠占’，然后将接收敌伪的公司商业工厂金融机关内容殷实者归为‘国营’，将倒塌不堪者向商民标卖，叫人民上钩。后方工厂的抗战功劳被一笔勾销，不予救济，甚至他们为找出路，不惜与帝国主义金融资本勾结，如开放内河航权，修改公司法，丧失国家主权，亦所不顾。于是价廉物美的美国货如排山倒海而来，这就是官僚资本一变而为买办资本，做帝国主义经济侵略者的先锋。”张氏称：“总之，全国财富已集中在几个大都市，而都市中的财富无疑的又集中在少数官僚军阀手里，贪污腐化，营私舞弊，行政和军事机构任何一个角落里，已到了糜烂崩溃的程度，好比人体中周身血液干涸，集中在头部，变为脑充血，试问危险不危险？最后张氏认为：‘中国财富分配的情形现象，可谓古今中外，无与伦比，重新分配的问题，已刻不容缓。’关于分配财富，他提出三条路：‘第一，这批发国难财胜利财者快觉悟，自动将所得的不义之财拿出百分之八十，救济难民。这是上策，但也是妄想。第二，政府迅速颁布重征财富政策，对他们加以法律制裁，将他们非法所得尽数吐出来。这是中策，然政权在他们手中，也是与虎谋皮，不会成为事实。所以免不了要走最后一条路，就是到了人民忍无可忍的时候，揭竿而起，流血革命。这当然是下策，应极端避免的，但观察当局，恐怕还是走这一条路，不到黄河心不死，真是可恨之至。’”
