Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: The *Liberation Daily's* editorial "Commentary on the Marshall-Stuart Joint Statement," published on the 14th, has resonated with all circles in Nanjing. According to a report in the *Shanghai United Evening News* on the 16th, the attention of everyone in Nanjing is now focused on reviewing America's policy towards China and the need to reaffirm it. They unanimously believe that even if the United States can shirk its role in mediating peace in China, it is difficult to shirk the actual supportive role it has played in China's civil war. One student said, "The United States cannot completely shed its responsibility as a third party like other countries. If it wants peace in China, why doesn't it come up with effective solutions? If it wants to support China's civil war, why does it use empty negotiations to cover up the large-scale civil war that is underway nationwide?" A female church worker believed that "the biggest mistake is America's two-faced approach." A professor in his forties said angrily, "The United States should formally reaffirm its commitment to stopping the Chinese civil war and implementing a democratic coalition government; otherwise, it should simply openly intervene in China's civil war with force." A pediatrician suggested, "If it is truly impossible to mediate the China issue, the best solution is to withdraw all American forces in China and exit the vortex of the China problem." A bank clerk said, "We hope that Marshall will not retreat at this point, and that the United States will no longer continue its ambiguous policy towards China, but will frankly and clearly review the past and effectively help China stop the civil war."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: Shanghai News: The *United Evening News* here carried a special dispatch from Nanjing on the 16th: "'Autumn wind, autumn rain sadden people to death,' this is enough to describe the anxiety and distress of people in the capital recently regarding the current situation." Since Marshall and Stuart jointly issued a statement on the tenth of this month, admitting that their efforts to promote peace and unity in China had effectively failed, it was not until the 14th that Chairman Chiang issued a Victory Day message, and the *Yan'an Liberation Daily* also published an editorial on the 14th, commenting on the Marshall-Stuart joint statement. The reporter believes that these two documents are the most authoritative expressions representing the attitudes of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and deserve special attention, so he consulted authoritative observers here for their opinions. According to the observer, judging from these two documents, it can be seen that the severity of the current situation has reached its extreme. The observer pointed out that Chiang's message did not mention the Marshall-Stuart statement at all, nor did it pay any attention to Marshall's mission. From this, it can be seen that the government's confidence in resolving the problem independently and its interest in Marshall's mediation mission have been reduced to zero. As for the *Liberation Daily* editorial, it is the opposite, from beginning to end, it is almost entirely discussing the Marshall-Stuart statement and American policy. This may be sufficient evidence of the Communist Party's consistent realism. The editorial seems to have slight criticism of Marshall, but the main accusation is clearly focused on American policy, not Marshall personally. The newspaper believes that Marshall's failure was due to American policy. The newspaper also stated that even if Marshall returns to his country, he must give an explanation and cannot shirk his responsibility, because the Chinese people and the other two countries participating in the Moscow Three-Power Decision will not agree. At this point, the reporter became interested in the Moscow Three-Power Joint Declaration and asked the observer for his opinion. The observer believed that the Three-Power Declaration is indeed a historical document for clarifying and stabilizing the situation in the Far East. Since the declaration, the Soviet Union and Britain have largely been able to abide by it, for example, the Soviet troops in Northeast China withdrew as scheduled. The reporter then asked about Britain. He stood up and pointed to a Reuters telegram, saying: "Chinese troops will no longer use Hong Kong as a transit country, because the Chinese civil war has expanded, and the British government, in order to maintain strict neutrality, does not want to provide Hong Kong for the Chinese army as a transit base..." He believed that although this is an insignificant matter, the British willingness and spirit to avoid getting involved in the civil war is worth noting. However, the Moscow Three Powers include Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Even if the opinions of the Soviet Union and Britain are consistent, the United States can still exercise its veto power if it does not intend to modify its policy. Therefore, the main key at present lies in the United States, depending on whether the Chinese people and American public opinion can prompt the White House to change its policy towards China.

　　解放日报“评马司联合声明”
    得到南京各界共鸣
    对美国两面作风咸表不满
    【新华社延安二十七日电】延安解放日报十四日“评马司联合声明”的社论发表后，得到南京各界的共鸣。据十六日沪联合晚报报导：南京所有人的视线，现在都集中在美国对华政策的检讨和必须重新申明。他们一致认为，美国即使可以推卸调处中国和平的作用，也难推卸在中国内战中所起的实际支持作用。一个学生说：“美国是不能和其他国家一样完全以第三者的地位轻轻摆脱责任的，如要中国和平，为什么不拿出有效的办法？如要支持中国内战，为什么又用空洞的谈判来掩盖着正在进行的全国范围的大规模内战？”一个教会的妇女工作者，以为“最大的错误，是美国的两面作风”。一位四十多岁的教授气愤的说：“美国应该正式重新声明停止中国内战、实行民主的联合政府，否则就索性公然以武力干涉中国内战。”一个小儿科的医生提出：“如果真正是无法调处中国问题，最好的办法是撤退美国在华的一切势力，退出中国问题的漩涡。”一个银行职员说：“我们希望马司不就此退却，美国也不再继续过去那种暧昧不明的对华政策，而爽快明朗的检讨过去，重新有效的帮助中国停止内战。”
    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪讯：此间联合晚报载南京十六日专电：“秋风秋雨愁煞人”，此足为最近首都人士对时局焦灼苦虑之写照。自本月十日马歇尔、司徒雷登两氏发表联合声明，承认其促成中国和平与团结之努力已实际失败后，直至十四日，始由蒋主席发表胜利纪念日文告书，延安解放日报亦于十四日发表社论，评论马司联合声明。记者以此两文件，为最足代表国共两方态度的权威表示，殊足重视，特将以询此间权威观察家之意见。据该观察家称：就此两文件观之，可知时局严重实已达于极点。该观察家指出：蒋主席文告中对马司声明只字未提，对马司任务亦未加致意，由此殆可见政府之单独解决问题之自信，而对马帅调解任务之兴趣已减低至于零点。至于解放日报社论，则恰与之相反，从头至尾，几全在申论马司声明及美国之政策，此或足为共产党人素主现实主义之一证。该社论对马帅似有微辞，但主要指责显然集中于美国政策，而非马帅个人。该报认为马帅之失败，乃由于美国政策所致。该报又表示马帅即使返国，亦必得有个交待，不能推卸责任，因中国人民及参加莫斯科三强决定的其他两国亦不会答应。谈至此，记者对莫斯科三强联合声明问题发生了兴趣，当又向该氏征询意见，该氏认为三强声明确不失为澄清与安定远东局势之历史文件，自该项声明以来，苏英两国大体上都能遵守，例如东北苏军如期撤退了。记者又询以英国如何？他站起来指着路透社的一个电讯说：“中国军队将不再以香港为转运国，盖因中国内战扩大，英国政府为保持严格中立起见，不欲以香港供华军作为转运基地……。”他认为此虽一不足道的小事，但英国避免卷入内战的意愿及精神，却值得注意。不过莫斯科三强是包括英美苏三国的，苏英的意见即使一致了，美国如果无意修改其政策，仍可行使否决权。故目前主要的关键，还是在于美国，要看中国人民及美国的舆论能否促使白宫改变其对华政策。
