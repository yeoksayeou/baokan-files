Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 12th. A small number of landlord descendants from Northern Jiangsu, who had mistakenly believed reactionary rumors and fled to Zhenjiang, Xinpu, Haizhou, and other places, have now successively returned to the Liberated Areas, unable to endure the oppression and abuse of the Kuomintang authorities and being driven to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war. Four hundred and six fugitive youths have returned to Sishu County, one hundred and twenty-seven have returned to Huaiyin, and tens of people have returned to each of the counties of Lianshui, Guanyun, and Tongyang from the Kuomintang areas. It is said that anyone who fled to Zhenjiang was required by the Kuomintang authorities to register at the "Refugee Center" run by Xia Puzhai, the former president of the pseudo-Chamber of Commerce of Siyang, and issued a "Refugee Certificate" before being taken in. They lived in dilapidated temples and ate thin gruel of coarse rice twice a day. Old and young, men and women, were all crammed together, and any slight dissatisfaction would be met with beatings and scolding. Those who were relatively wealthy were arbitrarily labeled by the special agents as "Communist spies" and extorted tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan. If they refused to pay, they would be imprisoned on the charge of "colluding with bandits." The situation was the same for those who fled to Xinpu, Haizhou, and other places. For example, Zhu Tangchao from Wangji District was extorted twice in Xinpu and imprisoned for eighteen days, all his belongings were confiscated, and he suffered all kinds of hardships before he managed to escape and return home. In Zhenjiang, the Kuomintang authorities established so-called "Youth Training Classes," forcing fugitive youths to undergo military training in preparation for serving as cannon fodder in the civil war. The youths who had been deceived into fleeing suddenly realized this and, recalling the democratic and free life they had lived in the Liberated Areas, compared it to the Kuomintang authorities' all kinds of abuse of the youth, and the difference was like heaven and earth. Regretting their actions, they immediately tried to return home. The governments and people of the Liberated Areas have taken care of those who were deceived and have become aware and returned. After more than ten fugitives from Tonggui (a newly established county located in Mohongzhen, northwest of Shuyang) returned from Xinhai, the local people held a welcome meeting to celebrate their return to the light. The democratic government also immediately returned the land and property rights that had been held in trust on their behalf after they left home. They were moved to tears and unanimously expressed their determination to settle down and build a career in the Liberated Areas and work hard for the construction of the Liberated Areas.

　　受不了国民党的欺压虐待            
    苏北逃亡地主子弟返乡   
    政府与人民帮其安家照顾备至
    【新华社沭阳十二日电】误信反动派谣言逃亡镇江、新浦、海州等地之苏北少数地主子弟，因不堪国民党当局欺压虐待及被驱作内战炮灰，现已陆续返回解放区。泗沭县逃亡青年归来四百零六人，淮阴归来一百二十七人，涟水、灌云、潼阳各县自国民党区归来者各有数十人。据说凡逃往镇江者，国民党当局限定必须向前泗阳伪商会会长夏逆朴斋等所主持之“难民所”登记，发给“难民证”始得收留，住的是破庙，吃的是一天两顿糙米稀饭。老幼男女全在一堆，稍有不满，便以打骂相加。较为富有者，则被特务们任意加“八路军密探”等帽子，敲诈十万百万不等，不给则即加“通匪”罪入狱。逃往新浦海州等地者，情形亦同样。如随王集区朱堂钞在新浦被诈索两次，下狱十八天，随身衣物悉被没收，受尽百般苦楚后，始得脱险归来。在镇江国民党当局设立所谓“青年训练班”，强迫逃亡青年受军训，以备充当内战炮灰。被骗逃亡的青年，于此恍然大悟，回想在解放区所过之民主自由生活，与国民党当局对青年之百般虐害相较，判若天涯。悔悟之余，即设法回家。解放区政府与人民，对被骗者的觉悟返回者，多方照顾。潼归（新设县，在沭阳西北莫洪镇）十余逃亡者自新海归来后，当地人民即召开欢迎大会，庆祝他们重见光明。民主政府亦将彼等离家后代为保管之地权财权当即归还原主，彼等感激涕零，一致表示今后决心在解放区安家立业，为解放区建设而努力。
