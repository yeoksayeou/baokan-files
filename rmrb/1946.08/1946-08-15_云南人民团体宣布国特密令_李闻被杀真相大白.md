　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: The Chongqing Democratic Daily published on July 21st: The Yunnan People's Association for Peace and Democracy has released a secret order obtained from Guomindang secret agents, revealing the truth about the killings of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. The document stated: "The government's policy for resolving the CCP issue is based on political solutions, and it is willing to make significant concessions and tolerate them. Therefore, a ceasefire order was specially issued in the Northeast, aiming to promote a sincere resolution of all outstanding issues. However, considering the recent intentions of the CCP, there is no sincerity. In preparation for any eventuality, governments at all levels should strictly eliminate hidden elements of dissident parties and grant special powers for their convenient disposal. Secret order from the Military Intelligence Bureau." It is evident that the assassinations of Li and Wen were the result of their "strict elimination" and "convenient disposal." The association pointed out: When Li returned to Kunming, reactionary publications of the Guomindang, such as "New China" and "Zhenglun," wantonly spread rumors, saying that he was a "Communist" and had brought a large amount of money to Kunming to organize a major riot. The Kunming Municipal Police Department's summer health slogans even openly stated "to eliminate Li Gongpu's infectious disease."

    李闻被杀真相大白
    【新华社延安十一日电】渝民主报七月二十一日载：云南人民争取和平民主协会公布所获之国民党特务密令一件，揭露李、闻被杀真相。该件内称：“政府对中共问题索本政治解决方针，不惜作巨大让步与容忍，故于东北特发停战令，乃在能促其诚意解决诸悬案。惟视该党最近意图，实无诚意。为准备万一计，各级政府对异党潜伏分子应严加清除，并特予便利处置之权。军统局密令。”可见李闻之被暗杀是其“严加清除”与“便利处置”之结果。该会指出：当李氏返昆时，国民党反动派刊物《新中国》《正论》等肆意造谣，说他是“共产党”，并携大批款项来昆活动，组织昆明大暴动，云南省警察局夏令卫生标语，且公开声称“要扑灭李公朴的传染病”。
