            Border Region Assembly Sends Telegram of Congratulations
    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] Upon hearing that General Jiang Jiabin led 5,000 troops in an uprising in Yucheng, people from all walks of life here were exceptionally delighted, unanimously stating: "This is the inevitable result of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a civil war." The Border Region Assembly, representing the people of the entire region, sent a telegram of congratulations, which stated in brief: "The General's leading of his troops in an uprising once again proves that the warmongering elements of the Kuomintang's attempt to unify China by force is doomed to be shattered, and the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely be victorious. This Assembly, representing the 30 million people of the Border Region, welcomes your troops to the liberated areas to fight together for independence, democracy, and peace, and extends our condolences!"
    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 14th Telegram] General Wang Yingzhi, deputy commander of the 17th Division of the 38th Army of the Chiang army, who laid down his weapons on the front lines in the self-defense operations carried out by the Eighth Route Army in Meng County, was a subordinate of Mr. Feng Yuxiang. He entered the Zhangjiakou Northwest Cadre School, organized by Mr. Feng, in 1925. After the defeat of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army led by Ji Hongchang, he engaged in education in Linfen and other places. After the "July 7th" Incident, he returned to the army to participate in the War of Resistance against Japan through the introduction of Mr. Feng Yuxiang. Mr. Wang Yingzhi said when he met with a special correspondent of this newspaper on the 7th: "I returned to the army to defeat Japanese imperialism. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, peace and democracy are the demands of the people. Mr. Feng Yuxiang once said: 'Ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred people want peace, and only half a person wants to fight, he is conscience-stricken.' We are being used by conscience-stricken people as tools for civil war. The responsibility for launching the civil war should be borne by the Nanjing government, and should be borne by American imperialism. Without the ambitions of American imperialism, the civil war would not be possible. The people of the Liberated Areas are right to engage in self-defense war, it is the only way to guarantee China's peace, democracy and independence."

　　蒋嘉宾将军率领官兵五千
    反对内战起义虞城
    不甘供蒋介石驱策充当内战炮灰与我军并肩为和平民主独立奋斗
    【新华社荷泽十六日急电】国民党夏（邑）虞（城）永（城）联合指挥部总指挥蒋嘉宾将军不甘供蒋介石驱策充当内战炮灰，于十五日乘我军大举反攻陇海之时，率领全部官兵五千人在虞城东南（砀山西北）之康楼举行反内战起义，与八路军并肩为中国人民的和平民主独立解放事业而奋斗！虞城县城高插义旗，重获解放，全县人民欢欣若狂，热烈庆祝与慰劳蒋嘉宾将军及全体起义将士。
            边区参议会驰电庆贺
    【本报邯郸讯】蒋嘉宾将军率部五千人于虞城起义，此间各界人士闻悉欢欣异常，一致表示：“这是蒋介石打内战必然的结果”。边区参议会代表全区人民驰电庆贺，原电略称：“将军率部起义，再度证明国民党好战分子企图以武力统一中国之迷梦必遭粉碎，中国独立和平民主事业定获胜利。本会代表边区三千万人民欢迎贵部莅临解放区，共同为独立民主和平而奋斗，并致慰问之意！”
    【本报阳城十四日电】八路军在孟县实行自卫作战，在火线上放下武器之蒋军三十八军十七师副师长王应芝将军，为冯玉祥先生部下，民国十四年即入冯先生主办之张家口西北干部学校。吉鸿昌所领导的抗日同盟军失败后，在临汾等地从事教育工作。“七七”事变，经冯玉祥先生介绍，重返部队参加抗日。王应芝先生于七日接见本社特约通讯员时称：“我重回部队是为着打倒日本帝国主义，现在抗战胜利了，和平民主是人民的要求，冯玉祥先生曾说：“一百个人有九十九个半人想和平，只有半个人想打仗，他亏着心。”我们却被亏心人利用来做内战工具。内战发动的责任应由南京政府负责，应由美国帝国主义来负责任。没有美帝国主义的野心，内战是打不起来的。解放区人民的自卫战争是应当的，只有这样才能保证中国和平民主独立。”
