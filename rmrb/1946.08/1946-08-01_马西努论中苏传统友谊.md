　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow, 27th broadcast: Commentator Masinu, discussing the traditional friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, stated: On July 25, 1919, the young Soviet Russian government issued a declaration to the Chinese people proposing the abolition of all unequal treaties concluded between the Tsar and China. On September 27, 1920, the Soviet Russian government again proposed to the Chinese government the establishment of Sino-Soviet relations on the principles of complete equality and mutual respect. This aroused a sincere welcome from the Chinese people, and the revolutionary government led by Sun Yat-sen established relations with the Soviet Union. "Alliance with Russia" was one of Sun Yat-sen's three major policies. The Soviet Union has consistently been faithful to its policy of friendship towards the Chinese people. From 1925 to 1927, the Soviet Union provided spiritual and political assistance to the Chinese people. When Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China, the Soviet Union was the first to assist China, and it was the first country to conclude a treaty of friendship and alliance with China.
    However, reactionaries inside and outside China did not want to see China become an independent, strong, happy, and free China. With the help of international imperialism, the Chinese reactionaries prepared to occupy the government for a long time. Negotiations with the Soviet Union were conducted under the pressure of democrats and agreements were signed with the Soviet Union out of necessity. From that time on, two lines appeared in China: one was the line advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, namely, the line of expanding Sino-Soviet friendly relations; the other was the line of the reactionaries, the line of Kuomintang warlords destroying Sino-Soviet friendly relations. The line implemented by the Chinese reactionaries was not to inherit the unfinished cause of Sun Yat-sen, but to complete the unfinished business of Japanese imperialism. The Chinese reactionaries attempted to use the anti-Soviet movement to cover up their conspiracy to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and provoke civil war in China. On the other hand, they also attempted to use the anti-Soviet movement to cover up their traitorous acts. They knew very well that they could not destroy China's broad democratic movement by relying on their own strength. Therefore, the Chinese reactionaries often relied on foreign reactionary forces, and one of their most important foreign pillars was Japanese imperialism. After Japan was defeated, the Chinese reactionaries lost an important pillar, so they tried to find a new international pillar. In order to obtain such support, the Chinese reactionaries did not hesitate to sell out all of China's territories, territorial waters, territorial airspace, and various privileges, and carried out anti-Soviet activities. In order to realize this determination, the Chinese reactionaries wantonly fabricated rumors and slandered the Soviet Union. For example, a certain newspaper of the Kuomintang reactionaries openly clamored for invading Siberia. What deserves the attention of the Chinese people is that the anti-Soviet conspiracy and the constant instigation of civil war by the Chinese reactionaries are carried out simultaneously.
    The attitude towards the Soviet Union is the touchstone of who is a democrat, who is a reactionary, who is a follower of Sun Yat-sen, and who is a traitor to the Three People's Principles.

　　马西努论中苏传统友谊
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科二十七日广播：评论员马西努论中苏传统的友好关系称：一九一九年七月二十五日，年青的苏俄政府，向中国人民宣言提议取消沙皇与中国缔结的一切不平等条约。一九二○年九月二十七日，苏俄政府重新向中国政府提议在完全平等与相互尊重的原则上，建立中苏关系，这引起了中国人民的诚恳欢迎，孙中山领导的革命政府，便和苏联建立了关系。“联俄”是孙中山三大政策之一，苏联一贯忠实于对中国人民的亲善政策，一九二五——二七年，苏联曾在精神上与政治上援助中国人民；当日本大举进攻中国时，苏联首先援助中国，苏联并且是第一个与中国缔结友好同盟条约的国家。
    但是，中国国内外的反动派，不愿看见中国成为独立强大幸福自由的中国，中国反动派在国际帝国主义帮助之下，准备长期盘据政府，与苏联进行谈判是在民主人士压迫之下进行的，迫不得已与苏联签订了协定。从那时起，在中国出现了两条路线，一条是孙中山先生赞成的路线，即扩大中苏友谊关系的路线；另一条是反动派的路线，是国民党军阀破坏中苏友谊关系的路线。中国反动派所实行的路线，不是继承孙中山未竟的事业，而是在完成日本帝国主义所未完成的勾当。中国反动派曾企图利用反苏运动掩盖其破坏政协决议，挑拨中国内战的阴谋，另一方面亦企图以反苏运动掩盖其卖国行为。他们深知依赖其本身力量不能摧毁中国广大的民主运动，因此中国反动派经常依靠外国的反动势力，其最重要的外国支柱之一，即日本帝国主义。在日本被击溃之后，中国反动派便丧失了一重要支柱，因此它力图找到新的国际支柱。为获得此种支援，中国反动派不惜出卖一切中国的领土、领海、领空等各种特权，并进行反苏。中国反动派为实现这种决心，又大肆造谣诽谤苏联，如国民党反动派的某机关报，曾公开狂言侵入西伯利亚。值得引起中国人民注意的，是反苏勾当与中国反动派的经常挑拨内战是同时进行的。
    对苏态度，是谁是民主主义者、谁是反动派、谁是孙中山的信徒、谁是三民主义的叛徒之试金石。
