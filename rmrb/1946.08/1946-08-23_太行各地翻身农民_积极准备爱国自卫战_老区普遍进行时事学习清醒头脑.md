　　Turned-Over Peasants in Taihang Actively Prepare for Patriotic Self-Defense War
　　Old Liberated Areas Universally Conduct Current Affairs Studies to Clear Their Minds

[This Dispatch from Changzhi] In the tense situation of the Chinese reactionaries relying on the American reactionaries to launch a full-scale civil war, the vast cadres and masses in the new and old areas of the Taihang region, from the mountains to the plains, have set off a climax of the self-defense and patriotic movement. In the old areas of Wuxiang, Licheng, Pingshun, Shexian, Yushe, Zuoquan, and other places, cadres and masses are universally conducting current affairs studies, clearing up five incorrect thoughts: First, the thought of laying down arms for peace. Second, the Li Zicheng thought of personal enjoyment. Third, the paralyzing thought of underestimating the enemy and being complacent. Fourth, the pessimistic and disappointed negative thoughts. Fifth, the panicky wavering thoughts. Licheng and Wuxiang districts have successively held village cadre meetings. Everyone has cleared their minds and made historical recollections of their liberation. Many cadres, after recalling the two kinds of lives in the past and present, have been aroused to a high degree of anger and combat courage against the reactionaries' civil war offensive, which has been unprecedentedly enhanced. At the cadre meeting in Zhongzhuang, the key point of the Fourth District of Licheng, a challenge competition was launched to repair the cotton fields in the entire district within seven days, hoe the millet and corn, and prepare to participate in the war. After the village cadre meeting in the First District of Wuxiang, current affairs propaganda was launched among the broad masses. All villages restored their wartime command posts and displayed the combat style of the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Thirty-two women from Bai Village in Yushe voluntarily organized a women's defense army to stand guard, eliminate traitors, transport wounded soldiers, and entertain soldiers. All parts of Shexian are actively preparing to participate in the war. Nine women in Liujiazhuang volunteered to go to the front to care for the wounded soldiers. In more than ten counties including Changzhi, Heshun, Xiyang, Lucheng, and Wu'an, the peasants who have been liberated or are being liberated in the vast new areas, when they heard that the Kuomintang reactionaries were about to bring in the American reactionaries to invade the liberated areas again, were aroused to greater indignation. The masses in various villages universally conducted current affairs discussions and self-reflection on their liberation, and they demanded to be armed and go to the front line to defend the fruits of their liberation. The anti-civil war and self-defense patriotic movement has launched heated discussions in the families of the liberated masses. In Changzhi, Xiyang, Lucheng, Tangyin, and other places, many fathers and wives are letting their sons and husbands go to the village and district offices to ask to join the army. When Lan Xiao from Dongyetou in Xiyang discussed the reactionary attack on the liberated areas with his father, his father said: "Don't worry about your mother's illness. She won't get better if you stay with her, and she won't die if you leave. If you don't go, she will die if the reactionaries come, even if she's not sick." An old man of forty-five and youths of sixteen or seventeen in Beijie Village in the county insisted on going to the front line. Because there were too many people asking to go to the front line, the county persuaded many youths to return to the village. Two hundred and eighteen people were persuaded to go back at one time, but these people were unwilling, crying loudly in a团 (tuán - group) and shouting that they had to go.
