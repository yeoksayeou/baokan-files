Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Nanjing News: Due to the serious economic crisis, the Shanghai business community formed a petition delegation to go to Beijing to petition, arriving in Beijing yesterday morning (9th) at 6:00 AM. The delegation of forty people, led by Shou Jingwei, Yang Guanbei, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jechen, and others, went to the Kuomintang government to petition at 8:00 AM that day, where they were received by Chief Civil Secretary Wu Dingchang. According to a Central News Agency report, the delegation made the following requests to the authorities: (1) Improve financial measures to save the financial crisis. (2) Implement a linked import and export system, subsidize export industries, and implement high-price purchases. (3) Request an industrial relief loan of 2 billion yuan. The petition delegation then went to the Executive Yuan to petition, but Song Ziwen had already flown to Shanghai beforehand, and they were only received by Jiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Comprehensive News: After American cigarettes poured into Hong Kong, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, the domestic cigarette industry suffered a fatal blow. American cigarettes dominate the entire market in Guangzhou. "Camel," "Morris," and other cigarettes retail for only 500 yuan per pack, while ordinary domestic cigarettes cost 400 yuan per pack, and the best brands are even twice the price of American cigarettes. As a result, nine out of ten (about eighty) cigarette factories have closed down. The largest "Ministry of Economic Affairs Southeast Cigarette Factory" has also ceased operations, resulting in the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers. In Shaoguan, over ninety percent of the more than two hundred cigarette factories have closed down, with only nineteen barely surviving. The Sichuan cigarette industry had 327 factories during the war, directly and indirectly supporting 100,000 people. In April alone, 230 factories closed down, accounting for 70% of the original number. Approximately 70,000 people have lost their jobs, and the rest are barely surviving in semi-starvation. In Ningbo, 43 cigarette factories were restored or newly established after the victory against Japan. By the beginning of last month, more than 30 of them had closed down. In Tianjin, domestic cigarette factories have also been closing down one after another. Even the British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company, which owns 98 cigarette-making machines, has announced its closure due to its inability to compete with American cigarettes.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Chongqing News: The bureaucratic capital's China Textile Corporation is dumping large quantities of American cloth in the interior, resulting in the shutdown of four-fifths of the more than 20,000 weaving factories in Sichuan Province, totaling approximately 16,000 factories. In Chongqing alone, one-third of the workforce has changed professions. Recently, patriotic merchants in various counties of Sichuan Province have advocated promoting domestic goods to resist this trend.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai News: The city's dairy industry, unable to maintain operations due to competition from American merchants, has begun slaughtering dairy cows. According to customs figures, imports of milk powder in April alone amounted to more than 430,000 kilograms. One American ship imported 29,000 boxes of condensed milk into the city, while the total monthly output of the local condensed milk industry is only 1,000 boxes. This large and continuous influx of imports has already seriously threatened domestic milk production, and the huge price difference has further accelerated their demise. According to a survey, the cost of producing one pound of domestic fresh milk is 1,050 yuan. However, the cost of one pound of American condensed milk, including freight and import duties, is only 336 yuan, and it sells for only 700 yuan on the market, resulting in a sharp decline in sales of domestic milk.

    上海工商界代表赴京请愿
    【新华社延安十日电】南京讯：上海工商界因经济危机严重，特组请愿团赴京请愿，已于昨（九）日晨六时抵京。该团一行四十人，由寿景伟、杨管北、金润庠、葛杰臣等率领，于当日上午八时赴国民党政府请愿，由文官长吴鼎昌接见。据中央社消息：该团向当局提出：（１）改善金融措施，挽救金融危机。（２）实行进出口连锁制度，并补贴出口业，实行高价收购。（３）请求工业救济贷款二十亿元等要求。该请愿团于旋赴行政院请愿，适宋子文已于事前飞沪，仅由行政院秘书长蒋梦麟接见。
    【新华社延安十日电】综合消息：美国香烟源源从港津沪等地涌出后，国产卷烟业顿受致命打击。广州美国香烟统治了整个市场，“骆驼”“摩理斯”等烟零售每包不过五百元，而普通国产烟每包也要四百元，最好的价格竟大于美烟两倍。因此九十九家烟厂已有十分之九（约八十多家）关门。其中规模最大的“经济部东南烟厂”也告停工，失业工人达数万人。韶关二百余家烟厂，百分之九十以上关门，现仅余十九家勉强维持。四川卷烟业在战时曾达三百二十七家，直接间接赖以为生的达十万人。单在四月份就倒闭二百三十家，占原数百分之七十。约七万人已告失业，其余仅勉强维持半饥饿生活。其他如宁波，在抗战胜利后卷烟业复业与新设者有四十三家，迄上月初止，其中三十多家已先后倒闭。在天津，国产卷烟厂也纷纷倒闭了，甚至拥有制烟机九十八台之英商颐中烟草公司，也因无法做美烟竞赛，而宣告停工。
    【新华社延安九日电】渝讯：官僚资本之中纺织公司将大批美国布匹倾销内地，结果使川省二万家以上织厂的五分之四约计一万六千家停机断杼。单是重庆一地改业者已占总数三分之一，近来川省各县爱国商人均主张提倡国货，以谋抵抗。
    【新华社延安九日电】上海讯：本市牛奶业，因受美商排挤无法维持，已发生屠宰乳牛现象。根据海关发表数字，今年四月份一月进口乳粉就有四十三万余公斤，而本市进口的一艘美轮就载来炼乳二万九千箱，这里炼乳业的总产量每月只有一千箱，这样大量不断的进口，国产牛奶本已受到了严重威胁，加上价格的悬殊，更促进了她们的死亡。据调查国产淡牛奶一磅仅制造成本就是一千零五十元。但美国炼乳连运费和进口税每磅成本才三百三十六元，市价只售七百元，因此国产牛奶销路顿失。
