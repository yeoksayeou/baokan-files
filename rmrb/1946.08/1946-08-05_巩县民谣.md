Gong County Folk Song

　　The Yellow River water, long and long, the north and south banks are not the same, the south side (KMT occupied area) is like hell, the north side (Liberated Area) is like heaven.

　　Speaking of the "big team" (referring to the PLA), everyone is happy, the army and the people are like one family, helping each other like fish and water. In April, the wheat is yellow, the army and the people cooperate to harvest grain, helping with cutting, threshing, and storing, working without disturbing for a drop of water or soup. Even if one lives a hundred years, one never experiences such a kind-hearted army!

　　Speaking of the suffering of hell, it breaks one's heart! The Yama Palace is set up in the office, the Baozhang (local head) is the living King Yama, with a crowd of judges and little devils, holding knives and guns to capture ghosts (meaning the Bao Gong office arresting people); before the wheat is ripe, it must be all taken, without grain, the fire pillar burns. A year of hard work and sweat, the harvested grain cannot be eaten!

　　Either death or life, the matter of life and death is not ordinary at this moment (cannot wait). If you want to die, hang yourself from the beam, to avoid suffering sooner; if you want to live, go north, cross the Yellow River to heaven! (Yang Zesheng)

　　巩县民谣
    黄河水，长又长，南北两岸不一样，南边（顽占区）似地狱，北边（解放区）似天堂。
    提起大堂好，人人喜洋洋，军民如一家，鱼水两相帮。四月天，大麦黄，军民合作去收粮，帮割帮打帮助藏，做活不扰点水汤。人活百岁经不遍，没见过这样军队好心肠！
    提起地狱苦，叫人痛断肠！森罗殿设在办公处，保长就是活阎王，判官小鬼一大群，手执刀枪捉鬼魂（保公所拿人的意思）；麦未熟，就要光，没有粮食火柱烫。辛苦血汗整一年，打下粮食吃不上！
    或是死，或是生，生死当下不平常（不能等待了）。想要死，上悬梁，早些免得受凄凉；想要活，往北方，渡过黄河上天堂！（杨泽生）
