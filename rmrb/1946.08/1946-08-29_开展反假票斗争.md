　　Launch a Struggle Against Counterfeit Currency
    Yang Jianzhong
    In the past two months, many counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in various parts of the border region, including Jichaopiao (冀钞) red 500 yuan notes, blue 500 yuan notes, red 100 yuan notes, brown 100 yuan notes, red 50 yuan notes, green 10 yuan notes, Pingyuan edition blue 100 yuan notes, Jichaopiao bank draft green 500 yuan notes, Taiyue Economic Bureau commercial circulation notes blue 50 yuan notes, Luxi Bank blue 100 yuan notes, red 100 yuan notes, and more than 20 other types. Furthermore, according to reliable information: the Kuomintang special agents in Shijiazhuang are rushing to print 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan notes. This is a vicious plot by the Kuomintang reactionaries to systematically sabotage our border region's financial system. Based on the materials we have obtained, the Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote manufacturing areas include Anyang, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Xinxiang. In Tianjin, the ×× Association directly leads this work. In Anyang, there are two places manufacturing counterfeit banknotes: one is in Cuiqiao (more than ten li from Anyang City), led by a certain regimental commander of Wang Ziquan's puppet army; the other is in Anyang City. The counterfeit banknotes coming from Anyang have been found with five letter prefixes: A, B, C, D, and E. It is estimated that the amount issued is quite large, and most of them are 500 yuan notes. From this, it appears that Anyang is the Kuomintang's major base for manufacturing counterfeit banknotes.

    The Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote printing factories are relatively secret, but the promotion of counterfeit banknotes to the Liberated Areas is carried out openly. The following methods of promotion have been discovered:

    (1) Openly selling them in cities and towns. Economic special agents, carrying a bag of counterfeit banknotes, hawk them along the streets. The price is one yuan of legal tender for three yuan of counterfeit banknotes, or one yuan of genuine Jichaopiao for seven yuan of counterfeit Jichaopiao.

    (2) Wang Ziquan's puppet army in Anyang uses counterfeit banknotes to pay military salaries, 30,000 yuan per person per month, which are then used in our border areas by plainclothes teams.

    (3) Taking advantage of traitorous merchants who use counterfeit banknotes to purchase materials in the Liberated Areas, such as grain, cotton, and homespun cloth, regardless of price, buying as much as they can and whatever they find. Merchants only pay a small amount of paper money for expenses, one yuan of legal tender buying five counterfeit banknotes (regardless of the face value). After purchasing the materials, the profits are split evenly between both parties.

    (4) Economic special agents use social connections to entrust people going to the Liberated Areas to bring counterfeit banknotes directly to our region for promotion.

    (5) Forced exchange. When merchants and ordinary people from Tianjin go to the Liberated Areas, they are forced to exchange any legal tender they carry for counterfeit banknotes at Kuomintang checkpoints. They even pretend to be compassionate, saying: "The Communist Party area does not use legal tender. To prevent you from suffering losses, exchange your legal tender for Jichaopiao to take with you!"

    (6) A small number of traitorous merchants in the Liberated Areas, in order to get rich, voluntarily go to Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other places to traffic in counterfeit banknotes.

    (7) Counterfeit banknotes are brought from Kuomintang areas to the Liberated Areas, and in order to evade our inspection, they adopt despicable and shameless methods: First, they use women. In Jingxian, two beautifully dressed women were caught with more than a dozen small pockets around their shirts and underpants filled with counterfeit banknotes. If calculated with 100 yuan notes, one person can carry 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. This kind of carrying does not reveal its true form from the outside. Second, merchants conceal them in the goods they transport, for example, by digging a hole in the middle of a roll of paper to hide the counterfeit banknotes. Third, boatmen carry them.

    The Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes is vicious and despicable. On the one hand, they attempt to undermine the credibility of Jichaopiao, create market chaos, and cause inflation in our area. On the other hand, they use counterfeit banknotes to solve some of their economic difficulties, such as seizing materials and paying military salaries. The Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes is planned and large-scale, unlike the Japanese imperialists' surreptitious counterfeiting during the War of Resistance. It should arouse serious attention and vigilance from all the people in the border region.

    After counterfeit banknotes were widely discovered in various parts of the border region in early June, our efforts have quelled the flames, but they have already caused us considerable harm. First of all, some merchants, farmers, and government troops mistakenly received counterfeit banknotes and suffered losses. For example, a store in Linzhang sold 200,000 yuan worth of goods, and 190,000 yuan were counterfeit. A small merchant in Handan who relied on selling cotton to support his family once sold 47,000 yuan worth of goods, and 40,000 yuan were counterfeit.

    The intrusion of counterfeit banknotes has made people in some areas doubt the Jichaopiao. For example, after a large number of 500 yuan counterfeit notes were discovered in Linzhang, there was a short period when people were unwilling to use 500 yuan notes, fearing losses. One merchant said: "Jichaopiao is good, but there are too many counterfeits." This sentence is worthy of our attention.

    The struggle against counterfeit banknotes must flexibly apply two principles: first, mobilize the masses; second, banks, party, government, military, and people must closely cooperate to carry it out together. The specific methods adopted by various regions this year include the following:

    (1) Governments at all levels convened special meetings to discuss and arrange the matter.

    (2) The bank that first discovered the counterfeit banknotes (mostly in the border areas) notified other banks in other regions by telephone or special messenger. The banks then printed and distributed methods for identifying counterfeit banknotes, attracting everyone's attention.

    (3) The banks and the government cooperated to conduct extensive publicity, holding forums with merchants, holding rallies at fairs, exposing the Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes, and telling everyone the differences between counterfeit and genuine banknotes. Village cadres regularly talked to the people about the counterfeit banknote problem at mass meetings.

    (4) Bank cadres regularly patrolled the market towns, and if counterfeit banknotes were discovered, they immediately gathered the people around and explained the situation to everyone. This method was very effective.

    (5) Banks universally established counterfeit banknote identification centers (represented by exchange offices or cooperatives) to facilitate the public in identifying genuine and counterfeit banknotes.

    (6) Militiamen and anti-smuggling personnel in the border areas conducted strict inspections to prevent counterfeit banknotes from entering the Liberated Areas.

    (7) Banks and public security organs cooperated to investigate and crack down on counterfeit banknote criminals. This is a very important task.

    Various regions have successively cracked down on more than a dozen major counterfeit banknote criminals, some involving 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and others involving 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Generally, a fine of one to three times the amount of the counterfeit money is imposed. The purpose of the fine is mainly to allow them to exchange the money in a short period and compensate those who mistakenly received counterfeit banknotes. For those with serious circumstances, the government will punish them according to law. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses in detecting counterfeit banknotes, a reward of 5% to 10% is stipulated.

    The struggle against counterfeit banknotes is an important part of the economic struggle against the stubborn elements. It is a long-term, arduous, and mass-based undertaking. The Kuomintang is constantly manufacturing counterfeit banknotes to sabotage us, and a slight oversight can lead to great losses. Therefore, we must always pay attention and be vigilant at all times. After this struggle, the people have become smarter. Whenever they are not sure about a banknote, they first take it to the bank or counterfeit banknote identification center to inquire and distinguish between genuine and counterfeit. This gives the counterfeit banknote promoters a severe blow. I believe that with the joint efforts of all the people in the border region, we have the strength to shatter the Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote conspiracy.

### 开展反假票斗争

　　开展反假票斗争
    杨建中
    最近两个月来，边区各地发现假票很多，有冀钞红色五百元券，蓝色五百元券，红色百元券，褐色百元券，红色五十元券，绿色十元券，平原版蓝色百元券，冀钞本票绿色五百元券，太岳经济局商业流通卷蓝色五十元券，鲁西银行蓝色百元券，红色百元券等二十余种。又据确息：石家庄国特正赶印千元券五百元券，这是国民党反动派有计划地破坏我边区金融的毒辣阴谋。根据我们得到的材料来看，国民党制造假票的地区有安阳，石家庄、天津、开封、太原、新乡等地。天津由××会直接领导这个工作，安阳有两个地方制造假票；一在崔桥（离安阳城十余里）由安阳伪军王自全部某团长领导，一在安阳城内。从安阳来的假票，已发现者有ＡＢＣＤＥ五个字头，估计发行额相当大，并且大部分是五百元券，由此看来安阳是国民党制造假票的大本营。
    国民党的假票印刷厂较为秘密，但是往解放区推销假票却是公开进行，据已发现的有下列几种推行方法：
    （一）在城内和市镇上公开出卖，经济特务拿着一布袋假票沿街叫卖，价格是一元法币买三元假票，一元真冀钞买七元假冀钞。
    （二）安阳伪军王自全部用假票发军饷，每人每月三万元，通过便衣队到我边沿区使用。
    （三）利用奸商拿假票到解放区购物资，如粮食棉花土布等，不论价格贵贱，要多少出多少，见什么就买什么，商人只付给少数纸消费，一块法币买五张假票（不管票面额大小），买到物资后，利益双方均分。
    （四）经济特务利用社会关系，委托到解放区的人，带假票直接来我区推行。
    （五）强迫兑换，从天津到解放区来的商人和老百姓，经过国民党检查哨时，凡带有关金法币的强迫兑成假票。并且假慈悲地说：“共产党地区不使用法币，为了不让你吃亏，你把法币换成冀钞带去吧！”
    （六）解放区有少数奸商，为了发财自动去天津石家庄等地贩回假票。
    （七）假票由国民党地区带到解放区，为了逃避我们检查，采用卑鄙无耻的办法：第一利用妇女，景县查获两个妇女装饰很漂亮，衬衣和衬裤周围，有十几个小口袋装假票。若以一百元券计算，一个人可带二三十万元，这样携带从外表来看是不露原形的。第二商人贩运杂货中夹带，例如将一领纸中间挖一个洞装假票。第三船夫携带。
    国民党制造假票的阴谋是毒辣而卑鄙的，一方面企图破坏冀钞威信，造成我市场混乱通货膨胀，另一方面利用假票解决其部份经济困难，如抢购物资发军饷等。国民党制造假票的阴谋，是有计划的大规模的，和抗战时期日本帝国主义偷偷摸摸搞假票不同。应引起全边区人民严重的注意和警惕。
    六月初边区各地普遍发现假票后，经过大家努力，凶焰虽已扑灭，但已带给我们不少危害。首先是有些商人农民和机关部队误收假票遭受了损失。例如临漳一个商店卖了二十万元，有十九万是假票，邯郸有一个小商人靠卖棉花养家度日，有一次卖了四万七千元，竟有四万元是假票。
    假票侵入使某些地区人民对冀钞发生怀疑。例如临漳发现大批五百元券假票后，曾有一个短时期，老百姓不愿使用五百元券，害怕吃亏。有一个商人说：“冀钞好是好，只是假的太多”。这句话是值得我们注意的。
    反假票斗争必须灵活运用两个原则：第一发动群众，第二银行和党政军民密切配合共同进行。今年各地采用的具体办法有下列几种：
    （一）各级政府召开专门会议讨论布置。
    （二）首先发现假票的银行（大多在边境区）用电话或专人送信通知其他地区的银行，由银行印制假票识别办法张贴送发，引起大家注意。
    （三）银行和政府配合广泛进行宣传，召开商人座谈会，逢集召开大会，揭发国民党制造假票的阴谋，将假票和真票的区别告诉大家，村干部在群众会议上，经常向老百姓讲假票问题。
    （四）银行派干部经常在集镇上巡视，如果发现了假票，立即把周围的人聚拢在一起向大家讲，这个办法效力较大。
    （五）银行普遍设立假票识别所（由兑换所或合作社代理）便利群众认清真假票。
    （六）边沿地区的民兵和缉私人员，进行严格检查，杜绝假票进入解放区。
    （七）银行和公安机关配合，设法侦察破获假票犯，这是很重要的工作。
    各地已先后破获大宗假票犯十余起，多的有二三十万元，少的亦四五万元，一般是处以一倍至三倍的罚金，罚金的用途，主要是让他自己短期兑换，赔偿误收假票者的损失，情节严重者，政府依法制裁。为了鼓励群众查获假票的积极性，规定百分之五至百分之十的奖金。
    反假票斗争是对顽经济斗争中一项重要工作，它是长期的，艰苦的群众性的，国民党时时刻刻在制造假票破坏我们，稍一不慎就遭受很大损失，因此我们要经常注意随时警惕。经过这次斗争后，现在老百姓已经学得聪明了，凡是自己认不清楚的票子，先拿到银行或假票识别所去询问，以辨真假，这给假票推销者一个严重打击。相信在全边区人民共同努力之下，我们是有力量把国民党的假票阴谋粉碎的。
