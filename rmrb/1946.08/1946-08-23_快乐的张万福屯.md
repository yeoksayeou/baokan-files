　　Happy Zhangwanfu Village
　　Liu Baiyu
    When I was in Beian County, Heilongjiang, I made a special "rural visit."

    I took a horse-drawn carriage through some meadows. The dense willow bushes were everywhere green. We went around a large bend along a ridge and arrived at Zhangwanfu Village. The old village consisted entirely of thatched houses. On the edge of the village, several farmers were building houses for themselves – red bricks and white wood. I immediately jumped off the carriage. A farmer standing on top of a wooden ladder happily said, "We haven't gotten a piece of wood or a tile in fourteen years!" Another said, "Not to mention fourteen years, I never thought I'd see this in my whole life!" Amidst the old, gray thatched houses, I discovered another house with a tin roof, already built, with delicate glass windows. The paint on the tin roof gleamed in the sunlight. Here I saw what true happiness is all about.

    Zhangwanfu Village is a village of nineteen households. The village's Farmers' Association Director, Xiao Yuanqing, is an honest farmer in his forties with a face weathered by the elements. With a thick beard and pockmarked face, he wore a strangely short but well-made jacket. He told me... these were people who had come to Heilongjiang more than twenty years ago to escape famine, establishing a small village on the barren land. Later, more and more people came, and it developed. Everyone relied on their strength to cultivate the land and make a living... When the Japanese devils came, they gradually seized everything for the "Development Group." They would only give you forty yuan for land that should have been worth two hundred yuan per mu (unit of area). From then on, none of the nineteen households in Zhangwanfu Village owned even an inch of land.

    "How did you survive then?"

    "The Japanese then leased the land back to everyone, and they became the masters – besides paying rent, we also had to provide labor. Imagine, even if someone died, they wouldn't report the death for years, and we still had to provide labor for them! We suffered all the hardships in the world. We had to post a lookout at the door even to eat a little bit on the sly. Do you see how many Kwantung Army troops were stationed in Beian County (he pointed to a distant barracks)? They wanted calves and chicks; they wanted live chickens, which they would skin and store in icehouses." As he spoke, he led me into the village. Another farmer said to me:

    "Now Lao Xiao is the district Farmers' Association Director!"

    Suddenly, Lao Xiao pulled me to one place. It turned out that the two hundred-plus hectares of land around the village used to belong to the Development Group, but now it had all been distributed to everyone. Xiao Yuanqing's family received four hectares of land (ten mu per hectare). Now, he was building three new rooms in the center of his land, next to the thatched house he used to rent. Surrounding this house, both in front and behind, was the land he had been allocated. This way, when he lay in bed and opened his eyes, he could see his land. The house wasn't finished yet, but red paper with the words "Auspicious Raising of the Beam" was pasted on the beam. He pulled me to the front of the house and stood there, loudly asking me to take a picture of him. While adjusting the camera, I clearly saw Lao Xiao's face, and every deep wrinkle, filled with the hardships of life, was now trembling slightly with excitement.

    I asked him.

    "Zhangwanfu Village has two hundred hectares of land, but how can you all cultivate it?"

    Because I had always doubted this problem, whether distributing land to the poor could solve the problem. Because as far as I knew, the soil in the Northeast is colloidal and very easy to solidify. Even ordinary cultivated land requires three animals to pull a plow in the spring, and in this area, over sixty percent of poor farmers do not have livestock. But Zhangwanfu Village once again proved the creative ability of people. Within a month of the land being distributed, all the land was planted. It turned out that after the land was distributed, the entire village was extremely enthusiastic. Under the leadership of Farmers' Association Director Xiao Yuanqing, they immediately pooled all the livestock and cultivated all two hundred hectares of land.

    I asked: "If this is the case, the land of those who have livestock is cultivated, wouldn't it delay the farming season for those who don't have livestock?"

    "No!" Xiao Yuanqing resolutely replied. "We cultivate a part of the land for those who have livestock and a part of the land for those who don't have livestock. The crops are planted at different times, so we can ensure that no one is delayed."

    Behind the village, I discovered a dwelling for poor farmers, two small mud houses housing three families. In the past, farmers couldn't afford to rent a room, so they rented a bed platform; if they couldn't afford to rent a bed platform, they rented half a bed platform. The misery of the farmers' lives can be imagined. The principle of land distribution in Zhangwanfu Village is that whoever lives in front of the land gets to farm it. Currently, ten households in the village are building new houses, and a new rural area is taking shape. Hunger, cold, and oppression will disappear here. What could be happier than this?

    Finally, on the street, an old man with a black beard who sold his labor mumbled to me: "My family is in the street," (referring to Beian) "I don't have a share of the land here, but I think I'll just stay here. I want them to write my name down..." I could see how purely the laborers loved the land.

　　快乐的张万福屯
　　刘白羽
    在黑龙江北安县的时候，我专门作了一次“农村访问”。
    我坐了马车走过一些草甸子，丛生的柳条处处是绿色，沿着一条岗子绕了一个大湾，到了张万福屯。旧的村庄，一排全是草房，在村庄边沿上几个农民正在为自己建筑房屋——红砖白木料。我立刻从车上跳下来，一个立在木梯顶上的农民高兴的说：“十四年没得到一块木料一块瓦呀！”另一个说：“不要说十四年，长这样大也没想到啊！”在灰旧的草屋中间，我发现另外一处用铁皮做顶的家屋，已盖好了，很精巧的玻璃窗，太阳光里铁皮上的油漆发着光，在这里我看到真正的快乐是怎样一回事了。
    张万福屯是一个十九户的村庄。村的农会主任肖元庆一个四十几岁风霜满面的诚实农民。丛生着须子、痧眼，穿一件短小得奇怪而质料很好的衣服。他告诉我……这是二十多年前早到黑龙江来逃荒的人，在荒地上建立的一个小村庄，后来人愈来愈多就发展起来了。大家都靠力气开地过日子，……日本鬼子来了，慢慢这里所有的都给“开拓团”强占去了。应该二百元一亩只给你四十元，张万福屯十九户人家从此没有一个再有一寸地。
    “那怎么活下去呢”？
    “日本人再把地租佃给大家，他们便作主人——我们除了交租之外，还要出荷，你想想人死了几年报不上死亡，还是一样出荷！我们算是受尽了人世间的苦难。偷偷吃一点，还得在门口放个哨。你瞧，这北安县驻了多少关东军（他指着远远一片兵营）？他们要小牛、小鸡，鸡要活的送去，他们把鸡肉剥下来送到冰房里去存起来。”一面说着他领我走进屯子里头来。另一个农民对我说：
    “现在老肖是区农会主任呢！”
    突然老肖把我一拉，拉到一处。原来这屯周围二百多垧地，都是开拓团地，现在一下又分配给大家了。肖元庆一家分到了四垧地（每垧十亩），现在他就在他的地中央，原来租住的草房一边，盖起三间新房屋来。绕着这房屋，房前房后都是他分到的土地，这样他躺在炕上一睁眼，就能看到他的地。房子还没盖完，梁上贴着红纸“上梁大吉”。他把我拉到房前面，自己站在那里，高声的叫我给他照一张像片。在照像机对光的时候，我清晰的看到老肖的脸，那每一条深深的盛满风霜的皱纹，现在兴奋得在微微的颤动。
    是我问他。
    “张万福屯二百垧地，可是你们怎样种得上呢？”
    因为我一直怀疑这一个问题，就是土地分到穷人手里是否能解决问题。因为据我所知，东北土壤是胶质的，极易凝固，就是普通熟地，春耕也必须三匹牲口拉犁，而这一带是百分之六十几贫苦农民都没有牲口。可是张万福屯又一度证明人的创造能力。全部土地分配后，一个月所有土地都种上了。原来分配土地后，全屯热情极高，在农会主任肖元庆领导之下，马上把所有牲口拉在一起，把所有二百垧地都耕种了。
    我问：“这样一来有牲口人家的地都耕了，没有牲口的岂不是误了农时？”
    “不！”肖元庆坚决回答。“我们把有牲口人家的地耕一部分，把没牲口人家的地也耕一部分，庄稼下种有先有后这样就能保证谁的也不误。”
    在屯后面我发现一处贫苦农人的住处，两间小泥屋，住了三户人。从前农人租不起一间房，租一铺炕，租不起一铺炕就租半铺炕，农人生活之惨可想而知了。张万福屯分土地的原则，是在谁门前的地就分给谁家种。目前全屯有十户上下都在建筑新屋，一个新的农村正在形成中。这里饥寒与压迫将绝迹，有什么比这再快乐呢。
    最后在街上一个黑胡子卖劳动力的老年人喃喃对我说：“我家在街上，”（指北安）“这里我没份分地，可是我想就算这里的吧，我要让他们把我的名字写上……”。我看出劳动者是多么纯朴的爱着土地。
