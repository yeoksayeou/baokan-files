Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris Dispatch: The Paris Peace Conference unanimously passed a resolution yesterday morning to invite Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt to attend the plenary session and express their opinions (but without voting rights) to the Committee on the Italian Peace Treaty. The British side intended to include Austria among the invited countries, but quickly withdrew its suggestion. The plenary session also elected French representative Dubarle as Secretary-General of the conference. In the afternoon, the plenary session debated Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi's statement to the conference. Yugoslav representative Kardelj declared: De Gasperi had requested that the territory of other countries be given to Italy. Therefore, Yugoslavia suspects whether the Italian government will use the achievements of the Italian anti-fascist struggle to support its imperialist demands. Kardelj asserted that De Gasperi's population statistics on Venezia Giulia were based on fabricated materials. De Gasperi had stated that if the French demarcation line were adopted, Italy's doors would be wide open. However, everyone knows that aggression has always come from Italy, not Yugoslavia. Kardelj also stated that De Gasperi is repeating the tactics used by the Italian representatives during the First World War. Kardelj finally pointed out that he absolutely opposes De Gasperi's request to delay the resolution of the Trieste and Venezia Giulia issues for a year. According to De Gasperi, in his statement to the conference on the 10th, he detailed Italy's participation in the opposition to fascist Germany in the later stages of the war and stated that this situation was not adequately reflected in the preamble to the Italian Peace Treaty. De Gasperi emphasized the "dangerousness" of the Council of Foreign Ministers' decision on the Venezia Giulia and Trieste issue and complained greatly about it, insisting that the Italian-Yugoslav border should be based on the Wilson Line, which would assign most of the Venezia Giulia region and other important cities to Italy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: The Paris Peace Conference has concluded its second week of work and adjourned yesterday. The second week of the conference focused on the debate over voting rules, which still falls within the scope of procedural rules. The five treaty draft committees may officially begin work this week, and the entire conference may conclude one week or ten days before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (September 23rd). Today is the first day of the third week of the conference, and it will be chaired by Benes. The plenary session will discuss Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi's statement and Albania's participation in the conference. De Gasperi appealed for lenient terms for Italy's peace treaty at the plenary session on the afternoon of the 10th. The Italian delegation of twenty-four representatives was the first of the former five enemy countries to attend the conference.

　　和会程序进入第三周
    卡德尔斥意领土要求
    阿尔巴尼亚等四国参加全会
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：巴黎和会于昨日上午一致通过邀请阿尔巴尼亚、墨西哥、古巴与埃及出席全会，及对意和约委员会发表他们的意见（但无表决权）。英方拟将奥地利包括在被邀请国内，但旋即撤回其建议。全会又选举法国代表杜巴尔克为和会的秘书长。下午全会辩论意总理加斯贝利对和会的声明，南代表卡德尔宣称：加斯贝利曾要求将别国的领土给意大利，因此南斯拉夫怀疑意大利政府是否将利用意国反法西斯斗争的业迹来支持其帝国主义要求。卡德尔力说加斯贝利关于朱利亚的人种统计数字，是以假造材料为根据的，加氏曾声言如果采纳法国划界线，则意大利的门户大开。可是谁都知道，侵略一向来自意大利，而不是南斯拉夫。卡德尔又称：加斯贝利正在重复施用第一次大战时意大利代表所用过的策略。卡氏最后指出他绝对反对加氏对的里雅斯特和朱利亚问题延迟一年解决的要求。按加斯贝利在他十日对和会的声明中，曾详述在战争后一阶段中意大利参加反对法西斯德国的情形，并称此种情况并未适当地反映在对意和约序言中。加斯贝利着重指出外长会议对朱利亚及的里雅斯特问题决定的“危险性”，并对此大加抱怨，坚持南意边界应依据威尔逊线，该线将朱利亚边区大部与其他重要城市均划给意大利。
    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎和会已结束其第二周工作，昨日休会。和会的第二周集中于投票规则的争辩，仍属程序规则范围。五个和约草案委员会可能于本周正式开始工作，整个和会的工作可能于联合国大会开幕（九月二十三日）之一周或十日以前结束。今日为和会第三周的第一天，将改由贝纳斯主席，全会将讨论意总理加斯贝利的声明及阿尔巴尼亚参与和会的问题。加氏于十日下午在全会上为意大利呼吁和约之宽大条件，包括二十四位代表的意大利代表团，为前五敌国最先列席和会者。
