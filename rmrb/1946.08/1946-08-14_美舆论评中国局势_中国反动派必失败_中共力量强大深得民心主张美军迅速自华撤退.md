　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: New York dispatch: Some American public opinion on the Chinese situation points out that the Chinese reactionaries are bound to fail. The New York Herald Tribune on July 30 strongly stated: Although the Kuomintang may be stronger militarily, the strength of the Chinese left-wing is greater than theirs politically. The Chinese left-wing is carrying out land reform with the peasants for the benefit of the peasants. The newspaper cited the main political program of the CCP as implementing democratic reforms, believing that the Chinese Communists can win the support of the broad masses of the people in implementing this political program. The newspaper pointed out in an editorial: "The policies of the Chinese Communists show that the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot defeat this policy." On the same day, an American newspaper essay broadcast by a New York radio station said: "The Chinese Communists demand land reform, and their demands will undoubtedly be approved by the people, not only from the point of view of people's livelihood, but also from the point of view of practical policy. The practicality of these demands has been tested in one-third of China's residents. The Chinese Communist Party has implemented Sun Yat-sen's great doctrine in these areas, including the basic purpose of his doctrine - to solve the democratic problems of the people."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to a United Press dispatch from Washington: California Congressman George Miller advocated the rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. He said in a statement on the 8th: "The sooner they leave China, the better our situation will be." He believes that one Marshall is enough for the United States in China, and he said that the U.S. military has little or no benefit to Marshall's effectiveness as a mediator. Miller is a member of the U.S. House Committee on Island Affairs and recently returned from a 33,000-mile trip around the world. He met with Marshall in China.

    中共力量强大深得民心主张美军迅速自华撤退
　　【新华社延安十日电】纽约讯：美国若干舆论评中国局势，指出中国反动派必然失败。七月三十日纽约论坛报力称：国民党虽然在军事上可能强些，可是在政治上中国左派的力量比他们强大。中国左派为农民利益与农民一起进行土地改革。该报引证中共政治纲领主要为执行民主改革，认为中国共产党人在实行这种政治纲领中，能够得到广大人民的拥护。该报在社论中指出：“中国共产党人的政策，说明国民党反动派不能战胜这一政策。”同日纽约电台广播的美国报纸论文中说：“中国共产党人要求土地改革，他们的要求不仅从民生观点，而且从实际政策的观点看来，无疑会得到人民的赞同。这些要求的实际性，已在中国三分之一的居民中考验过。中国共产党在这些区域内实行了孙中山的伟大学说，其中包括他的学说的基本目的，--解决人民的民主问题。”
    【新华社延安十日电】据合众社华府讯：加利福尼亚州众议员乔治·密勒主张自中国迅速撤退美军，他于八日发表谈话称：“他们离开中国愈快，我们的情况就会更好。”他认为美国在中国有一个马歇尔也就够了，他说美军对马歇尔作为调解人的有效性很少，或者没有裨益。密勒氏为美众院岛屿问题委员会的委员之一，最近才周游世界三万三千里归来，在中国时曾与马歇尔晤谈。
