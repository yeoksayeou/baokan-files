Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 20th: This reporter visited Wang Yifang, the commander of the First Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Nationalist Army, who staged an uprising at the Nanquan Station on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway on the 10th, withdrawing from the civil war. He recounted the uprising, saying: "Our battalion has long been deeply dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war policy. This time, being sent to the front lines of Jiaodong to directly participate in the civil war, all officers and soldiers could not bear to harm our fellow compatriots. Therefore, at 5 PM on the 10th, we evaded the surveillance of special agents like Deputy Da Zhong, who were trained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and led more than 400 men in an uprising, opposing the civil war and entering the liberated area."

He then narrated that this special agent force was established in 1937 by the Military Intelligence Bureau under Dai Li as an "anti-espionage" "Advance Column." After the signing of the army reorganization plan, Chiang, in order to cope with the continued civil war after the army reorganization and demobilization, combined the Advance Column, Commando Corps, Loyal and Patriotic Army, and some puppet troops into 18 columns, under the guise of traffic police, but in reality, they were responsible for "suppressing the Communists." After the death of special agent leader Dai Li, Chiang gave a speech saying: "Now I directly lead you. The only enemy in front of us is the Communist Party. You must work hard to剿捕and eliminate the Communist Party." "You are my most trusted troops. I hope each of you can play the role of ten people." Chiang sent a large number of senior special agents trained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization to supervise various places. In the First Battalion, there were six, including Deputy Da, who received secret subsidies from Chiang.

When departing from Shanghai, the regimental commander summoned the battalion commanders and conveyed Chiang's secret order: "Go to Jiaodong, on the one hand, to fight the Communists, and on the other hand, to monitor other National Army troops. Establishing merit and achieving success is now or never." After arriving in Qingdao, the regimental commander again said to the battalion commanders: "The Eighth Army and the Fifty-Fourth Army are not doing well in the front. We are the most trusted of Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted troops, and we must complete our mission."

At this point, he exposed the crimes of Chiang and the US colluding to carry out an anti-people civil war, saying: "Let alone anything else, the fact that the carbines and Thompson submachine guns we use are all supplied by the US military in Tianjin is enough to prove it."

Speaking of his impressions of the liberated areas, he said: "What is most touching is the enthusiasm of the people in the liberated areas in welcoming us like relatives returning home. When we saw the people loving the Eighth Route Army like their own children, and the Eighth Route Army respecting the people like their parents, it reminded us of the people's past suspicion of us, and made us realize that only the people's army can have a close relationship with the people. We were even more envious of the united, well-fed, and happy life of all classes of people in the liberated areas."

In contrast, he lamented the dark crimes within the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the Chiang army. He said: "The most heartbreaking thing in the Chiang army is that the medical supplies for wounded soldiers are embezzled by superiors, resulting in many lightly wounded soldiers becoming disabled and no one caring about them. Even someone of my rank would not be cared for if injured."

On behalf of all the officers and soldiers, he firmly stated: "We are willing to work together with the army and people of the liberated areas to build a new China that is independent, peaceful, and democratic."

　　陈述胶东起义经过
　　揭露蒋介石内战阴谋
    【新华社莱阳二十日电】记者于日前往访十日在胶济路东段南泉车站举行起义退出内战之国民党交通警察第十五总队第一大队的王一芳，渠陈述举义经过称：本队对蒋介石之内战独裁深怀不满。此次被派至胶东前线，直接参加内战，全体官兵不忍自残同胞手足，乃于十日下午五时避开由中美合作所训练的特务大种副等的监视，率部四百余人起义，反对内战，开入解放区。接着他叙述这支特务武装系于二十六年由军统局戴立系所建立为“防谍性”的“挺进纵队”。整军方案签订后，蒋为应付整军复员的继续内战，遂将挺进纵队、别动总队、忠义救国军等，及部分伪军，合编为十八个纵队，以交通警察为名，实则担任“剿共”。特务头子戴笠死后，蒋曾训话称：“现在我直接领导你们，我们面前的敌人只有共产党，你们要给我努力剿捕和消灭共产党。”“你们是我最亲信的部队，我希望你们一个人能起十个人的作用。蒋派有大批由中美合作所训练的高级特务监掌各处，第一大队内就有大副等六名，彼等领取蒋之秘密津贴。由上海出发时，总队长曾召集大队长传达蒋的密令谓：“到胶东去，一面打共产党，一面监视其他国军，建功立业，在此一举。”抵青岛后，总队长又向各大队长说：“第八军及五十四军在前面打的都不顺利，我们是蒋委员长亲信之亲信，一定要完成使命。”至此，他揭发蒋美合谋进行反人民内战的罪迹谓：“别的且不说，单就我们用的卡趣式和汤姆式类机枪均系由天津美军供应一事，即足证明。”谈及对解放区观感，据他说：“最受感动的是解放区人民像欢迎亲人回家似的接待我们的热忱，当我们看到人民爱八路军如子弟，八路军敬人民如父母的情感，使我们回想起过去人民对我们的疑惧，并使我们知道了唯有人民的队伍，才能与人民关系密切。对解放区各阶层人民团结一致丰衣足食的愉快生活，更为羡慕。”在两相对比中，他慨叹国民党统治区及蒋军内部的黑暗罪行，他说：“在蒋军内最令人痛心者，为伤兵因医药被上级贪污以致许多轻伤员成为残废而无人过问，就是像我这样的阶级，一旦负伤，也不会有人理睬。”他代表全队官兵坚决表示：愿与解放区军民共同为建设独立和平民主之新中国而奋斗。
