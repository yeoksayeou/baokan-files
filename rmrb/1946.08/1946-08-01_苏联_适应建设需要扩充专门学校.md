　　Soviet Union
    Expands Specialized Schools to Adapt to Construction Needs
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet Education Minister Kavtanov announced that 550,000 students in higher education research institutions have completed their courses this year, with 70,000 experts graduating from various fields, exceeding last year by 50%. They are warmly welcomed by factories, schools, hospitals, and laboratories and do not fear any threat of unemployment. Kavtanov stated that the number of college students in the Soviet Union ranks first in the world, exceeding the total number of students in European countries. However, it still cannot adapt to the increasing needs of the national economy. This year, we can only meet one-fifth of the demand. In the future, Soviet higher education institutions will graduate 100,000 to 130,000 people annually and enroll 170,000 to 180,000 people. Before 1950, 674,000 students will enter higher education institutions. Kavtanov concluded that the Soviet Union is primarily expanding schools that train the most important industrial and agricultural experts, and special attention will be paid to specialized sciences that are most important to the national economy and national defense.

　　苏联
    适应建设需要扩充专门学校
    【新华社延安廿八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联教育部长卡夫塔诺夫宣布：在高级教育研究机关中，五十五万学生已完结了他们今年的课程，毕业的各业专家达七万人，比去年超出百分之五十。他们受到工厂、学校、医院与实验室的热烈欢迎，而不惧有任何失业的威胁。卡氏称：苏联的大学生，在数量上居世界之首位，超过欧洲各国学生的总和，但是仍不能适应国家经济中日益增涨的需要。今年我们也只能满足五分之一，以后苏联的高级教育机关将每年毕业十万到十三万人，招生十七万到十八万人，一九五○年以前将有六十七万四千学生入高级学校。卡氏结语称：苏联首先扩充的是训练最重要的工业与农业专家的学校，对国家经济与国防上最重要的专门科学，将受到特别重视。
