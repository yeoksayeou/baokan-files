　　Bianqu Postal Administration
    Actively Rectifies Operations
    Postage Rates to Increase from September
    [Report from Handan by Our Newspaper] Since Mr. Su Aiwu took over as the new Director of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Postal Administration, he has been actively engaged in rectification. The meeting of the heads of the business sections of various district bureaus was successfully concluded a few days ago. The meeting decided on five work plans for the second half of this year: simplify the organization, improve efficiency, increase revenue, reorganize trunk lines, and open remittance services. The bureau has now established a postal cadre school, drawing in bureau chiefs and business section heads from various county bureaus for training, to strengthen the idea of "serving the people" and to improve business skills, and to complete the postal enterprise. The first class has 44 students, with a training period of four months. The Border Region Post Office is expected to make considerable progress after this rectification.
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] In recent months, prices have soared, but postage rates have remained at the original price. The Bianqu Postal Administration, due to excessive losses, has decided to increase postage rates from September 1st: local ordinary letters 5 yuan, out-of-town 10 yuan, single registered 20 yuan, double registered 40 yuan, newspapers 2 yuan (news articles, also the same for envelopes with cut corners), and letters sent by family members of revolutionary soldiers are free of charge.

    积极整顿业务
    邮资将自九月起加价
    【本报邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫边区邮政管理总局自新局长苏爱吾氏接任以来，积极从事整顿，各区局业务科长会议已于日前完满闭幕，会上曾决定今年下半年五项工作计划：简化机构、提高效率、增加收入、整理干线、开放汇兑。该局现已举办邮政干部学校，抽调各县局局长暨分局业务科长受训，以加强“为人民服务”的思想，并提高业务技术，完成邮政企业化。第一期学员已有四十四人，受训期为四个月。边区邮政经此整顿当有长足进步。
