Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 2nd. Regarding the sabotage of mediation work by the Kuomintang representatives of the Taiyuan Executive Group, spokespersons for our Jinlu, Jinjiluyu, and Jinchaji Military Regions have issued the following joint statement: On the 26th of this month, the Kuomintang representative of the Taiyuan Executive Group delivered a memorandum to our representative, stating that they received a telegram from their committee member saying, "If CCP group members conduct espionage work, local military organs will handle them as spies," etc. This action by the Kuomintang representative is a blatant attempt to unreasonably restrict the freedom of action of our group members and a conspiracy to harm them at any time with trumped-up charges, exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' plot to sabotage peace negotiations and expand the civil war. Therefore, we lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang representative and demand that the Executive Headquarters immediately order the Taiyuan authorities and the Taiyuan Group to guarantee the safety of our group members. The Kuomintang side shall bear full responsibility for any harm suffered by our group members.

　　太原小组国方代表破坏调处我三个军区特发表联合声明
    【新华社兴县二日电】为指挥太原执行小组国方代表破坏调处工作，我晋鲁、晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀三个军区发言人，特发表联合声明如下：本月二十六日，太原执行小组国民党代表递送我方代表备忘录一件，内称奉彼方委员电：“如中共小组人员实施谍报工作，将由当地军事机关按间谍罪处理”等语，国民党代表此举显系企图无理限制我方小组人员工作行动自由，并阴谋随时以“莫须有”罪名加以危害，暴露国民党反动派破坏和平谈判扩大内战的阴谋。为此我们特向国民党代表提出严重抗议，并要求执行部立即下令太原当局及太原小组保障我方小组人员安全，我们小组人员如遭受任何危害，均应由国民党方面负完全责任。
