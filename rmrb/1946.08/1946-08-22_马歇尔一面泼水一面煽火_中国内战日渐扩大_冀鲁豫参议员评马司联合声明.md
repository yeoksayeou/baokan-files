　　Chinese civil war expands daily
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Senators comment on Marshall-Stuart Joint Statement
    [Heze 19th Dispatch] The dramatic joint statement issued by Marshall and Stuart has aroused anger from all walks of life in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region.

    Mr. Pei Yuming, a senator of the Border Region Senate, told reporters that the joint statement of Marshall and Stuart completely exposed the US policy of assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries in fighting the civil war, and exposed Chiang Kai-shek's determination to attack the Chinese people. He said: "The United States, on the one hand, mediates the Chinese civil war, and on the other hand, transports ammunition, sends warships, guns, and artillery to Chiang Kai-shek, trains marksmen for Chiang Kai-shek, and sends military advisers to Chiang Kai-shek. Obviously, this clever 'mediation' technique was exchanged for a secret agreement between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. In the seven months that Marshall has been in China, the consequence has been that the Chinese civil war has expanded day by day, and the Chinese people have suffered more and more. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, Chiang Kai-shek used American planes to bomb Jining and Nanle, and American-armed troops attacked eastern Henan and northern Huai, massacring peaceful people in the border region. The old folks in the border region will no longer believe Marshall's 'mediation' tactics." Old Man Pei said angrily: "No matter how the United States helps Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war and makes the Chinese people suffer more, I dare to believe that the Chinese people are bound to win."

    The revolutionary poet Wang Yaping, who recently fled to the Liberated Area, said: "The joint statement of Marshall and Stuart is not surprising. The Chinese people have long known that American imperialist elements want China to be like the Philippines, where the Kuomintang uses secret agent terror tactics to prevent the Chinese people from asking about state affairs. But if someone betrays China, shouldn't the Chinese people ask a question? Since Marshall came to China, Chiang Kai-shek's bloody policies have become more and more rampant. The so-called Marshall mediation of the civil war only makes Chiang Kai-shek's methods more terrifying." Mr. Wang, the chairman of the Heze City Chamber of Commerce, said: "The United States is pouring water on the fire while fanning the flames. The United States wants Chiang Kai-shek to dominate the world so that it can profit from it. Therefore, it reconciles on the surface but orders attacks inside."

　　马歇尔一面泼水一面煽火
　　中国内战日渐扩大
    冀鲁豫参议员评马司联合声明
    【荷泽十九日电】马歇尔与司徒雷登发表戏剧性的联合声明后，已激起冀鲁豫边区各界的愤怒。
    边区参议会参议员裴毓明老先生接见记者谈称：马歇尔与司徒雷登之联合声明，完全暴露了美国援助国民党反动派打内战的政策，暴露了蒋介石进攻中国人民的决心。他说：“美国一面调停中国内战，一面给蒋介石运军火、送兵舰、枪炮、给蒋介石训练射击手、给蒋介石派军事顾问，显然这一套高明的“调停”手法，是蒋介石与美帝国主义之密约所换取。马歇尔来华七个月，所造成的后果是中国内战一天比一天扩大，中国人民一天比一天痛苦，就冀鲁豫边区来说，蒋介石用美国飞机轰炸济宁、南乐，美国武装的军队进攻豫东、淮北，屠杀边区和平人民，马歇尔这一套“调停”手法，边区老百姓再不会相信了。”裴老激愤的说：“无论美国怎样帮助蒋介石打内战，使中国人民更痛苦，但是我敢相信中国人民是一定要胜利的。”
    最近逃抵解放区的革命诗人王亚平说：“马歇尔与司徒雷登的联合声明并不稀奇，中国人民老早就知道美国帝国主义分子骨子里是想让中国做菲律宾国民党统治运用特务恐怖手段，叫中国老百姓不问国事，但是有人出卖中国，中国人还不应该问一问吗？马歇尔来华以后，显然使蒋介石的血腥政策一天比一天猖獗，所谓马歇尔调停内战，不过更使蒋介石的手段恐怖而已。”荷泽市商会王会长说：“美国是一面拨水，一面扇火，美国心想叫蒋介石独霸天下，他好渔利，所以表面调和，里面叫打。”
