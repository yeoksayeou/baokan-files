　　Protest Against Chiang's Aircraft Raids on Yan'an
    *Liberation Daily* Commentary
    Yesterday, Yan'an City suffered its first bombing and strafing by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft. The War of Resistance against Japan has been won for almost a year, and the Liberated Areas and the people of the whole country are earnestly hoping for peace. However, Chiang Kai-shek has brazenly sent aircraft to wreak havoc on Yan'an. Not only are people from all walks of life in Yan'an indignant, but the people of the whole country will become clearer and more vigilant about Chiang Kai-shek's acts of war.
    Chiang's aircraft's attack on Yan'an is another ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a civil war. It exposes Chiang Kai-shek's various deceptive propaganda. Chiang Kai-shek once told Mr. Kui Yanfang and other representatives of the peace petition group that "I will not even fight back if the Communists come to attack." Yan'an is the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the center of the Liberated Areas' peaceful and democratic construction. Why must Chiang Kai-shek adopt the same means as the Japanese to invade Yan'an? This proves that the dictator's lies must be understood from the opposite perspective. The actual content of "political solution" is "military solution"; the actual content of "I will not even fight back if the Communists come to attack" is "Regardless of the Communist Party's continuous struggle for peace, I will still fight it." In his acts of launching a civil war, Chiang Kai-shek not only tried his best to deceive the Chinese people, but also tried every means to deceive foreigners. Currently, he has instructed his ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to declare that "there is no civil war in China." Today, while Chiang's troops are frantically attacking the Liberated Areas in the Central Plains, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, Chiang's aircraft are shamelessly bombing Yan'an, the "center of democratic China" (according to the American Far East expert, Bisheng). This is a signal that Chiang Kai-shek is more frantically carrying out a nationwide civil war, and it is also a shameless provocation to the entire Chinese peaceful and democratic movement. The people of the whole country and the world will see this fact more clearly. No matter how hard Chiang Kai-shek tries to deceive, the eyes and ears of the world cannot be blinded.
    The people of Yan'an and the people of the Liberated Areas have grown stronger in the eight years of arduous War of Resistance and nearly a year of self-defense struggles against the reactionaries. The people of the Liberated Areas have full confidence in their own strength and the cause of national independence, peace, and democracy. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to use the eight American bombs that bombed Yan'an and all the aid that American imperialism gave him to scare the people of the Liberated Areas is simply a dream! The result of the bombing of Yan'an can only further increase our hatred for domestic fascist dictators and foreign armed interventionists.
    The bombing of Yan'an is a satire on the so-called "mediating role" of the United States in China. While the Nanjing negotiations are intermittent, the planes given by the Americans are actually bombing and strafing the center of the CCP, one side being mediated. This event alone is enough to show how serious the extent of the US authorities' interference in China's internal affairs has developed! It is time for the American people to unite and stop this interference with practical actions.

　　抗议蒋机袭延
    解放日报时评
    昨天延安市第一次遭受了蒋介石飞机的轰炸扫射。抗战胜利已将一年，解放区与全国人民莫不殷切希望和平，而蒋介石竟悍然派飞机来延安肆虐，不但延市各界人士愤懑万分，全国人民对蒋介石的内战暴行，也会更加清楚，更加警惕。
    蒋机袭击延安，是蒋介石发动内战的又一铁证，它揭破了蒋介石的种种欺骗宣传，蒋介石曾对篑延芳先生等和平请愿团代表说过，“甚至共产党来打也不还手”。延安是中共中央所在地，是解放区人民和平民主建设的中心，为什么蒋介石必欲采取和日本人一样的手段来侵犯延安呢？这可证明对独裁者的鬼话，必须从反面去了解，“政治解决”的实际内容，就是“武力解决”；“甚至共产党来打也不还手”的实际内容，就是“不管共产党始终为和平奋斗，我还是要打它”。蒋介石在其发动内战的行径中，不仅尽力欺骗国人，而且千方百计欺骗外国人，目前他曾命驻美大使顾维钧氏宣称“中国没有内战”。今天在中原、苏皖、山东、山西、河北等地蒋军都在疯狂地向解放区进攻之时，蒋机竟无耻向“民主中国中心”（美远东专家毕生语）的延安滥施轰炸，这是蒋介石更疯狂地进行全国规模内战的信号，也就是对全中国和平民主运动的无耻挑衅，全国人民和全世界将更清楚地看清这一事实。不管蒋介石怎样费尽心计，天下人的耳目是无法蒙蔽的。
    延安的人民和解放区的人民，是在八年艰苦抗战和将近一年来对反动派进行自卫斗争中壮大起来的，解放区人民对于自己的力量和全国人民独立和平民主事业，具有充分的信心。蒋介石想拿轰炸延安的八枚美国炸弹和美国帝国主义给他的全部援助来吓唬解放区人民，那简直是梦想！轰炸延安的结果，只能更加增加我们对国内法西斯独裁者的仇恨与外国武装干涉者的仇恨。
    延安的被炸，是对美国在中国的所谓“调停地位”的一种讽刺，在南京谈判若断若续之时，美国人给的飞机竟在被调停的一方面——中共中心地区投弹扫射。只这一事件，就足以表现美国当局干涉中国内政的程度已发展到怎样严重的程度！美国人民一致起来制止这一干涉，是实际行动的时候了。
