Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 31st: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on an editorial in the New York Times on the 24th, titled "Our Task in China," stating: The author of the article not only openly defends the current US authorities' policy of assisting Chiang in the civil war, but also reveals the author's prejudice and confused ideas. The Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out: (1) The editorial writer of the New York Times attempts to obliterate the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government launched the civil war by saying that "war is inevitable." However, the facts cannot be obliterated. On the same day that the New York Times published the editorial, the New York Herald Tribune also published an editorial saying: "We can hardly ignore or deny the fact that the reactionaries in China, as stated by Ms. Soong (referring to Ms. Soong Ching-ling), are attempting to launch a civil war." In recent days, Congressmen DeLacy and many American democrats have been clamoring for an end to aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. It can be seen that the attempt of the New York Times editorial writer is futile. In fact, anyone with a little common sense can see the absurdity of that editorial. According to its statement, both Japan and the United States were "two sides of the war" in the Pacific War, and there was no such thing as a culprit at all, and the US war against Japan became superfluous. (2) The New York Times editorial says: "Chiang Kai-shek's National Government is the only recognized Chinese government and has been guaranteed American assistance as a wartime ally." We only need to ask the editorial writer, is the Nationalist government recognized by the United States the only one? Besides the United States, which other country is aiding Chiang in the civil war and interfering in China's internal affairs? The US government recognizes more than just the Chiang Kai-shek government in various countries. May I ask which other government of another country has been given the same "assistance" as the Chiang government by the US government? The editorial writer of the New York Times only knows that the National Government of China is recognized by various countries, but he does not know (or perhaps he is "forgetful") that the Moscow Conference Declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the Three Powers signed by the US Secretary of State stipulates that this government needs to be reorganized, and President Truman's statement also admitted that this government is a one-party government and that it needs to be reorganized. Obviously, the US authorities' "assistance" to Chiang is illegal, and the "only recognized Chinese government" cannot change this truth in the slightest. (3) The New York Times editorial's statement that "any protest should not be directed at the government and its supporters, but should severely condemn those who oppose the government" is even more outrageous and completely inconsistent with the democratic traditions of the American people. According to this formula, protests should not be "directed at" the dictatorial government of murderers, but should be "directed at" democratic figures such as Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu who were shot by this government.
    The Xinhua News Agency reporter finally stated: It is worthy of deep attention from American democrats that the New York Times, which often reflects the opinions of the US authorities, has published such absurd remarks.

　　美纽约时报言论荒谬新华社记者予以驳斥
    【新华社延安三十一日电】新华社记者评纽约时报二十四日社论“吾人在中国之任务”一文称：该文作者不仅公开为目前美国当局的援蒋内战政策辩护，而且流露了作者的偏见和糊涂观念。新华社记者指出：（１）纽约时报的社论作者企图以“战争非有的方面不可”的说法，来抹煞蒋介石独裁政府发动内战的事实。但是事实是抹煞不了的，在纽约时报发表社论的同一天，纽约先驱论坛报也发表了一篇社论说：“我们也难忽视或否认宋氏（按指宋庆龄女士）所称中国反动派企图发动内战的事实。”最近几天，德拉西等议员及许多美国民主人士都在大声疾呼，要求停止援助蒋介石内战。可见纽约时报社论作者的企图是徒劳无功的，其实稍有常识的人都可看出那篇社论的荒谬可笑。按照它的说法，太平洋战争中日本与美国都是“战争的两方面”，根本无所谓祸首，而美国的对日作战也成为多余的了。（２）纽约时报社论说：“蒋介石之国民政府为唯一被承认之中国政府，而以战时盟国资格获得美国协助之保证。”我们只要问一问社论作者，承认国民党的政府不只美国政府，除了美国以外，还有那一个国家援蒋内战干涉中国内政呢？美国所承认的各国政府也不只一个蒋介石政府，试问美国政府对于那一个其他国家的政府也给了像给蒋政府那样的“协助”呢？纽约时报的社论作者，只知道中国的国民党政府被各国所承认，但他不知道（也许是“健忘”）美国务卿所签字的三国外长莫斯科会议宣言规定了这个政府有改组之必要，杜鲁门总统的声明也曾承认这一政府是一党政府的事实与其改组之必要。显而易见的，美国当局对蒋的“协助”是不合法的，“唯一被承认之中国政府”并不能丝毫改变这一真理。（３）纽约时报社论所说“任何抗议不应指向该政府及其拥护者，而应痛斥反对该政府者”，更是太不像话，完全不合美国人民的民主传统。按照这种公式，抗议不应“指向”杀人犯的独裁政府，而应“指向”被这种政府枪杀的闻一多、李公朴等民主人士了。
    新华社记者最后称：常常反映美国当局的意见的纽约时报，竟然发表这样荒谬的言论，值得美国民主人士的深切注意。
