Representatives from the Border Region Government and the Municipal Government attended to offer their congratulations. Principal Hu Jing@① stated in his address: The private Jianye Accounting School is funded by several entrepreneurs and is divided into five departments. These departments separately cultivate cadres commissioned by various entrepreneurs, including students with high school degrees and three to five years of accounting experience, as well as students recommended by various enterprises and agencies or those who applied independently. In addition, there are evening school and correspondence departments. The students in this session are all accountants sent by various enterprises, factories, and companies, and most have a considerable foundation. To meet the urgent need for enterprise development, the study period is only one month. Vice Principal and Head Instructor Wang Fenglai explained that the school's learning method is to follow the mass line and the practical line. He said: As long as one thoroughly learns cost accounting related to practical application, it will be universally applicable. Mr. Chen Xiyu, a school director, emphasized that cost accounting is the key to the industrialization of factories and enterprises. He called on all students to overcome the notion of underestimating accounting and successfully complete their learning tasks.
    【Another Dispatch】The Jianye Accounting Firm opened on the 26th.

Although it is commercial in nature, its main purpose is to serve society and help develop the social accounting profession. The firm plans to use 70 percent of its profits to subsidize the Accounting Society and the Accounting School. Accountant Wang Fenglai explained that hiring accounting consultants guarantees the rights of shareholders and the development of enterprises, and the establishment of an accounting system also helps to balance prices. Representatives spoke one after another, offering various suggestions. Zhang Guangdou, manager of the Taichang Flour Company, said: "As enterprises develop day by day, they need the support of accountants even more. Currently, the most needed thing is a calculation method for cost accounting items." Guest Liu Shuxian said: "At present, many enterprises are established by private shareholding. With the guarantee of accountants, shareholders will be more at ease, which will greatly guarantee the cost reduction, output increase, and profit increase of the enterprises themselves." Zhang Xinzhou, head of the Accounting Section of the Border Region Government, hoped that the association would first provide assistance to the accounting systems of governments at all levels.
