One battalion of Chiang's army, cavalry, police special detachments, and other forces totaling over 700 men occupying Dagushanzi, Faku, have been harassing the Democratic Allied Army for days. On August 17th, after a defensive counterattack and fierce fighting by the Allied Army, most of them were annihilated. Over 240 Chiang soldiers were killed, wounded, or laid down their arms.
