Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. On the morning of the 29th, the Eighth Route Army's defense area near Anping Town, southwest of Xianghe, was subjected to a surprise attack. In the forced self-defense, the Eighth Route Army discovered more than 30 American soldiers, cooperating with more than 80 Chiang troops in the battle. As a result of the fighting, both sides suffered casualties. In the afternoon, a part of the U.S. military rushed from Tianjin to reinforce. In order to promote the U.S. military's awareness, the Eighth Route Army immediately withdrew from the battle. This is the truth of the so-called "Communist army attacking the U.S. military" by the Central News Agency. According to Brigadier General Whorton, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, the U.S. military that clashed with the Eighth Route Army was a "patrol team" from Tianjin to Ping. Mr. Wa did not explain why the U.S. military sent a "patrol team" to "patrol" to the Liberated Areas, and fought alongside Chiang's troops to attack the Eighth Route Army. In the past two months, the U.S. military has continued to provoke and disturb the Jidong Liberated Area, and now openly cooperates with Chiang's troops to directly fight against the people's army, so that American soldiers who could have returned home to live and work in peace after the end of the war against Japan are making unnecessary sacrifices in China. The Jidong Military Region Headquarters has asked the Beiping Executive Headquarters to investigate the Anping conflict and lodged a strong protest with the U.S. for its illegal act of armed interference in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. Tianjin News: The English evening paper here published an Associated Press telegram on the 1st, saying that U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson said that there are currently 90,000 U.S. Marines stationed in China.

　　美蒋军并肩作战
    进攻香河西南我军防地           
    我冀东军区向美方严重抗议
    【新华社延安卅一日电】二十九日上午，香河西南安平镇附近之八路军防地，受到突然袭击，八路军在被迫自卫中，发现美军三十余人，配合蒋军八十余人作战，战斗结果，双方均有死伤。至午后复有美军一部自天津赶到增援，八路军为促美军之觉悟，当即退出战斗。这就是中央社所谓“共军袭击美军”之真相。据驻津美海军陆战队参谋长瓦顿少将宣称：与八路军发生冲突之美军，系由津赴平之“巡逻队”，对于美军为何派“巡逻队”“巡逻”到解放区，并与蒋军并肩攻打八路军，瓦氏并无解释。两月以来，美军不断向冀东解放区挑衅滋扰，现在竟公开配合蒋军直接对人民军队作战，以致对日战争结束后本可回家安居乐业的美国士兵，在中国作无谓之牺牲。冀东军区司令部已向北平执行部要求调查安平冲突经过，并向美方严重抗议武装干涉中国内政之不法行动。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】天津讯：此间英文晚报曾于一日刊载美联社电讯，谓美副国务卿艾其逊称：现在驻华美军陆战队共有九万名。
