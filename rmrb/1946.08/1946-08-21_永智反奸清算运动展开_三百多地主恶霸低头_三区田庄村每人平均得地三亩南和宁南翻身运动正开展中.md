【Report from this newspaper in Weixian】After the liberation of Yongzhi County, the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts successively carried out rent reduction, interest reduction, capital increase, and land redemption movements. In the five districts of the county, two-thirds of the villages have established workers and peasants associations and sub-district representative assemblies. However, the failure to promptly launch an anti-traitor movement to further develop and consolidate the unity of the middle and poor peasants resulted in the long-term isolation of hired laborers and poor peasants, while landlords and stubborn elements seized the opportunity to launch widespread counterattacks. After more than one hundred cadres from the District Committee's Land Reform Work Team arrived in Yongzhi, their month-long efforts completely changed this situation. Out of the county's two hundred and fifty-six villages, more than one hundred large villages have been mobilized, and more than three hundred households of local tyrants, landlords, and traitors have been liquidated. The masses participating in the liquidation account for ninety percent of the total number of households. Farmers in most villages have obtained land, houses, and property. Farmers in Tianzhuang Village in the Third District received at least three mu of land and 80,000 yuan in property per person. The breakthrough was primarily due to the control of local armed forces, the implementation of traitor elimination and anti-espionage measures, the suppression of secret agent assassinations, and the removal of fear among the masses and cadres. In the anti-espionage movement in the Third District, three gangs of "political bandits" were eliminated. The assassination cases in Fengzhuang, Luzhuang, Wangfangzi and other villages have all been solved.

【Report from this newspaper】After the Land Reform Work Teams in Southern Hebei went to the countryside, they worked closely with local leaders according to the local situation, formed groups to go to the countryside to conduct investigations and research, and organized the masses to carry out land reform in a planned manner. After investigation and research in Ningnan, based on the actual situation in each region and the demands of the masses, the masses were mobilized again. According to statistics, there are sixty villages in the county that need to be further mobilized (including seventeen that have not been mobilized at all). The one hundred and twenty members of the Land Reform Work Team are divided into work groups and assigned to various districts, under the unified leadership of the original district. Each group has a key village to create experience. A base company is transferred from the county and assigned to various districts to suppress secret agents and support the masses. Specific methods: first investigate and study the rural class relations and existing problems. Then, start from organizing the masses to pour out their bitterness, holding "thinking meetings" to find the root causes of poverty, and enlighten the masses to rise up in struggle. More than fifty members of the Northern University Land Reform Work Team arrived in Nanhe in early August and have now been divided into five groups to cooperate with local cadres to go to the countryside and mobilize the masses to carry out land reform.

　　永智反奸清算运动展开
　　三百多地主恶霸低头
    三区田庄村每人平均得地三亩南和宁南翻身运动正开展中
    【本报威县讯】永智县解放后，二、三、四、五区相继进行了减租减息增资赎地运动。全县五个区已有三分之二的村庄建立了工农会和小区代表会。但未迅速开展反奸运动，进一步发展与巩固中贫农的团结，故使雇佃贫长期孤立，而地主封顽趁机普遍反攻。地委翻身队百余干部到永智后，经过一月努力，完全改变了这一局面。全县二百五十六村，已发动起来一百多个大村，清算了三百多户恶霸地主和汉奸，参加清算的群众，占总户数百分之九十，多数村庄农民获得了土地房屋和资财。三区田庄农民，每人起码得到土地三亩，资财八万元。局面的打开首先是由于掌握地方武装，实行除奸反特，镇压特务暗杀，解除群众与干部的恐惧。三区在反特运动中，消灭了三股“政治土匪”。冯庄、芦庄、王坊子等村暗杀案件，均被破获。
    【本报讯】冀南各地翻身队下乡后，根据当地情况，与当地领导密切配合，分组下乡进行调查研究，有计划的组织群众翻身。宁南经调查研究，根据各地区的实际情形和群众要求，重新放手发动群众。据统计全县需要继续发动的村庄有六十个，（内有根本未发动者十七个）翻身队一百二十人编为工作组，分配各区，由原区统一领导。各小组有一个重点村创造经验。由县抽调一个基干连，分配各区镇压特务，给群众撑腰。具体作法：先调查研究农村阶级关系和现有的问题。再从组织倒苦水，开“想想会”找穷根启发群众的觉悟，引导其起来斗争。北方大学翻身队五十余人八月初到达南和，现已划为五个小组，配合本地干部分头下乡，普遍发动群众翻身。
