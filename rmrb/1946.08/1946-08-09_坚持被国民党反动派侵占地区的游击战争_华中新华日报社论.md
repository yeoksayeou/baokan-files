Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th: The Huazhong Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Persist in Guerrilla Warfare in Areas Occupied by the Kuomintang Reactionaries," pointing out that the occupation of some towns and villages in the Suwan Liberated Area by the reactionaries can only be a temporary phenomenon. The military and civilians of Suwan have won democracy and freedom in the life-and-death struggle against the enemy, puppets, and all evil forces, and will never tolerate the barbaric rule, enslavement, and plunder of the reactionaries. We will continue to use the old magic weapon that we used to defeat the Japanese invaders in the past, that is, to persist in and expand guerrilla warfare until the reactionaries are eliminated or driven out.

The editorial then listed many favorable conditions for carrying out guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas:

First, the reactionaries are isolated and helpless among the people. They are in an antagonistic position with the broad masses of the people. The troops of the reactionaries, who are divorced from the masses, almost 100% of the soldiers and many middle and lower-level officers are disgusted with the civil war. Because the reactionaries have limited troops, they cannot be used in a dispersed manner, thus weakening their control over the occupied areas. This is an objective favorable condition for persisting in guerrilla warfare.

Second, the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan have tempered the people of the Liberated Areas. In the struggle against the Japanese invaders and improving their own lives, they have raised their awareness, strengthened their organization, and accumulated experience, and have the confidence, strength, and methods to deal with their enemies. This is the social foundation for persisting in guerrilla warfare.

Third, in most of the occupied areas, we have county and district backbone armed forces, and a relatively widespread militia organization. These people's armed forces grew up during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is the armed foundation for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.

Fourth, we have local cadres who were born and raised here, who not only have years of struggle experience, but also have an inseparable connection with the masses. This is the organizational foundation for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.

Fifth, this kind of guerrilla warfare is not isolated and helpless. It has a vast area without enemies to rely on, and a strong main force fighting on the main battlefield, playing a decisive role in coordination. This is the surrounding environment for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.

After listing these favorable conditions, the editorial believes that the following efforts should also be added subjectively:

First, we must further rely on the masses and use the path of the masses. Everything should proceed from the interests of the masses, universally arouse the hatred of the masses, oppose "left" and right deviations, and unite local mass leaders, militias, and the broad masses of the people like family and sons.

Second, prevent a purely military point of view. The armed forces in the occupied areas must become armed political work teams, and use various methods to win over all peace-loving and democratic troops and people from all walks of life to the anti-civil war front, and launch the Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and Liu Shanben movements everywhere. Even if he is a soldier, a "member of the armed home return group," regardless of his past, as long as he opposes the civil war today, we will sincerely welcome him.

Third, strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and guerrilla tactics, flexibly apply them to actual struggles, and launch a mass "unpredictable" guerrilla war: sometimes attacking the enemy in front, sometimes attacking the enemy in the rear, sometimes concentrating on attacking the enemy at one point, and sometimes dispersing and harassing everywhere, making the other side feel that there are enemies everywhere and unable to figure out the real situation, in order to achieve the purpose of confusing, containing, exhausting, and consuming the invaders. On the one hand, the reactionary occupation areas cannot expand further, and the landlords and gentry cannot collect grain and wealth, the people are still ours, and the villages are still ours. On the other hand, it gives great convenience to the main force's combat. Only when the guerrilla warfare of the local armed forces is coordinated with the mobile warfare of the main force can we carry out large-scale self-defense wars more powerfully.

The editorial finally emphasized: The reactionaries are not stronger than the Japanese invaders, and the people's strength is much stronger than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. As long as we are good at using various favorable conditions, relying on the masses, and extensively launching and persisting in guerrilla warfare, we can not only drive the reactionaries out of the occupied areas, but it will not take too long. Oh! I hope we can cleverly use all kinds of favorable conditions to rely on the masses and extensively launch and persist in guerrilla warfare, not only can we drive the reactionaries out of the occupied areas, but it will not take too long.

　　坚持被国民党反动派侵占地区的游击战争
    华中新华日报社论
    【新华社淮阴六日电】华中新华日报顷以“坚持被国民党反动派侵占地区的游击战争”为题，发表社论，指出苏皖解放区若干城镇村庄之被反动派侵占，只能是暂时的现象。苏皖军民在与敌伪及一切恶势力的生死斗争中，获得了民主自由，决不能再容忍反动派的野蛮统治奴役和掠夺。我们将继续使用过去曾用于战胜日寇的老法宝，即坚持与扩大游击战争，直到把反动派消灭或赶出为止。
    该社论继列举在被侵占地区进行游击战争的许多有利条件：
    第一，反动派在人民中间是孤立寡助的。他们和广大人民处于敌对地位。脱离群众的反动派的部队，几乎百分之百的战士和许多中下级军官都厌恶内战。反动派因为兵力有限，势不能分散使用，因此便减弱对于侵占地区的控制力。这是坚持游击战争的客观有利条件。
    第二，八年抗战锻炼了解放区的人民。在对日寇战斗与改善自己生活的斗争中，提高了觉悟，加强了组织，积累了经验，有信心，有力量，有办法对付他们的敌人。这是坚持游击战争的社会基础。
    第三，在被侵占的绝大部分地区，我们都有县、区的基干武装部队，有比较普遍的民兵组织，这些人民武装，是在八年抗战中生长起来的，这就是我们坚持游击战争的武装基础。
    第四，我们有土生土长的地方干部，不但有多年的斗争经验，而且与群众有血肉不可分离的联系。这就是我们坚持游击战争的组织基础。
    第五，这种游击战不是孤立无援的，有广大的没有敌人的地区可以依托，有坚强的主力在主要战场作战，起着决定性的配合作用。这就是我们坚持游击战的周围环境。
    该社论列举这些有利条件之后，认为主观上还应加上如下的努力：
    第一，要进一步的依靠群众与运用群众的路。一切从群众的利益出发，普遍的发动群众同仇敌忾心理，反对“左”右偏向，团结当地群众领袖、民兵和广大人民，像家人父子一样。
    第二，防止单纯的军事观点。被侵占区的武装要成为武装政治工作队，要用各种办法争取一切爱好和平民主的部队和各阶层人士到反内战的战线上来，到处掀起反内战的高树勋、潘朔端、刘善本运动。那怕他是一个战士，一个“武装还乡团员”，不问其过去如何，只要他今天反对内战，我们就要竭诚欢迎。
    第三，加强学习毛主席的战略思想与游击战术，把它灵活地运用到实际斗争中去，展开群众性的“神出鬼没”的游击战争：时而击敌前，时而击敌后，时而集中打敌一点，时而分散四处扰乱，使对方感觉到处都是敌人，到处摸不清真实情况，以达到迷惑、牵制、疲惫与消耗侵犯者。一方面使反动派占领地区不能更大的扩张，也能使地主绅士们的政权不能收到粮食资财，人民还是我们的，乡村还是我们的。另方面给主力作战以极大的便利。只有地方武装的游击战与主力军的运动战配合起来，才能更强有力地进行大规模的自卫战争。
    该社论最后着重指出：反动派并不比日寇强大，而人民的力量则比抗战时期更强大得多。只要我们善于运用各种有利条件，依靠群众，广泛地展开与坚持游击战争，不但可以把反动派从被侵占地区赶出去，而且为时不会太长。唷Ｖ灰?颐巧朴谠擞酶髦钟欣?跫??揽咳褐冢?惴旱卣箍?爰?持游击战争，不但可以把反动派从被侵占地区赶出去，而且为时不会太长。
