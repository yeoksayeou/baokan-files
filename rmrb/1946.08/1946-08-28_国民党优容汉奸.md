Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Shanghai dispatch: He Dehui, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, served as the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council and an advisor to the pseudo-Xin Sheng Daily during the enemy-puppet period. He was a notorious traitor who assisted the enemy. However, after the victory, the Kuomintang authorities not only failed to punish He, but instead appointed him as the Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, later changing his position to Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Luo Heng and other resident members of the Nanjing参政会 formally reported him to the authorities on the 19th of last month, and presented evidence such as official documents signed by He during his tenure as Director-General of the pseudo-Municipal Council. However, the Kuomintang authorities turned a deaf ear and tried their best to defend He. Therefore, He is still swaggering in and out of the Shanghai Municipal Government, working as usual, causing an uproar of criticism in Shanghai's public opinion circles in recent days.

　　国民党优容汉奸
    【新华社延安廿五电】沪讯：上海市政府秘书长何德奎，在敌伪时期曾任伪沪工部局总办及伪新声报顾问等职，为为虎作伥之著名汉奸，但胜利后，国民党当局对于何逆不仅未予惩办，反委为上海副市长，后改任市政府秘书长。南京参政会驻会委员罗衡等于上月十九日向当局正式检举，且提出何逆在任伪工部局总办时期所签署的公文等证据，讵国民党当局仍装聋作哑，竭力为何逆辩护。故迄今何逆仍昂然进出上海市政府，照常办公，以致沪市舆论界连日纷起抨击。
