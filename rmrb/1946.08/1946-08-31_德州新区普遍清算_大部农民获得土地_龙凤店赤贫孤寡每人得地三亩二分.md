[Report from our Jinnan correspondent] In more than thirty villages west of Dezhou, an anti-traitor liquidation movement has been launched. In the struggle against concealing land and shifting burdens, the broad masses of middle peasants have also been drawn into the movement. The peasants have legally recovered blood-and-sweat debts, reducing rent and recovering grain payments totaling 24.45 million yuan, equivalent to more than 2,000 mu of land. In the new district of Gucheng, District One, near Dezhou, the large landowners Xie and Ma, and landowners from outside the district, occupied more than 80 hectares of land. Their tenants, who were subjected to high rents and exploitation, were scattered across more than 70 villages in the district. After the incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), in order to evade enemy and puppet extortion, the landlords mortgaged most of their land, causing many tenants to lose their land and their lives to become even more impoverished. After the liberation of Dezhou, the turn-over movement was launched in more than 30 villages including Dongbalizhuang and Longfengdian. The turning-over horn for the peasants first sounded in Dongbalizhuang and Xiaotun. Tenant farmers and poor peasants accounted for one-half of the village, most of whom rented land from the Ma family. During the rent reduction struggle, the middle peasants also joined together to settle accounts with the landlords for illegal spending. In their grievances, the tenants said that when paying rent, they not only had to address the landlords with respectful titles, but if they were late, even a moment late, one dou of rent would be increased by one sheng, and if they were three days late, the land would be taken back. In times of famine, even if no grain was seen, the tenants still had to sell their belongings and land to pay the rent, leaving many farmers separated from their wives and children. As a result of the liquidation, the peasants recovered 530 mu of land. The peasants in Xiaotun recovered 123 mu of land, and 130 poor peasant tenant households received land. Secondly, the masses in Longfengdian had a very high desire to turn over, but the leadership was controlled by bad elements. The chairman of the farmers' association, the captain of the self-defense force, and the "cowherd" (the landlord's steward) jointly suppressed the peasants and obstructed and sabotaged the turning-over movement. After understanding the situation, the turning-over team detained the "cowherd" Wang Yutian. The peasants said to him, "You have been a 'cowherd' all your life, and you are still a pauper! We poor people are all one family!" These words moved Wang Yutian, and he confessed their sabotage conspiracy and offered the landlord's documents to help the tenants settle accounts. As a result, the peasants recovered unpaid rent, returned concealed land and paid burdens in silver dollars equivalent to 281 mu of land. Fifty-six households of also impoverished, widowed, orphaned and tenant families were distributed land, with an average of 3.2 mu per person. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers had 5 mu per person, and the middle peasants also received some.

　　德州新区普遍清算
    大部农民获得土地
    龙凤店赤贫孤寡每人得地三亩二分
    【本报冀南讯】德州以西三十余村展开反奸清算运动。在反黑瞒地和转嫁负担斗争中广大中农也全部卷入运动，农民们依法收回血汗账，共减租倒粮款二千四百四十五万元，折合土地二千余亩。靠近德州的新区故城一区，大地主谢家马家和外区地主即占有土地八十多顷，被他们高租剥削的佃户，遍布全区七十多个村，事变后地主为逃避敌伪勒索，将大部土地典当出，以致许多佃户失掉土地，生活更加无着。德州解放后，东八里庄、龙凤店等三十余村，即普遍展开翻身运动。农民的翻身号炮首先在东八里庄，小屯打响了，该村佃户贫农即占二分之一，大部租种马家土地。减租斗争时，中农也联合向地主清算非法花消，诉苦中佃户们说到交租时不只爷爷奶奶的称呼人家，并且送晚了一时一斗租即加一升，迟了三天就将地收回。灾荒时没见粮食，佃户也要卖东西卖土地来交租，许多农民被弄得妻离子散。清算结果，农民收回土地五百三十亩。小屯农民收回土地十二顷三十亩，一百三十家贫农佃户得到了土地。其次龙凤店群众要求翻身情绪很高，但领导权被坏分子掌握了，农会主任、自卫队长、牛头（地主的管家）联合压制农民，阻碍与破坏翻身运动。翻身队了解情况后，把牛头王玉田扣了，农民们向他说：“你当了一辈子牛头，还是个穷光蛋呀！咱们穷人才是一家人！”这话感动了王玉田，他坦白出他们的破坏阴谋，并献出了地主的文书来帮助佃户清算。结果农民收回倒租，退黑瞒地负担洋折合土地二百八十一亩。五十六户亦贫、孤寡、佃户分得土地，每人平均已有三亩二分，抗属三户每人已有五亩，中农也分得一部。
