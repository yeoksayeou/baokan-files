　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th (delayed dispatch). The Northeast Provinces Representative Joint Conference, lasting nine days, victoriously concluded on August 15th. The Administrative Committee held its first meeting on the same day, electing Lin Feng as Chairman, and Zhang Xuesi and Gao Chongmin (Head of the Northeast General Branch of the Democratic League, Chairman of the Andong Provincial Government) as Vice-Chairmen. All members of the Administrative Committee solemnly swore an oath of office at the closing ceremony, while also warmly celebrating the anniversary of the Northeast People's Liberation on "August 15th." On that day, the conference began with Chairwoman Han Youtong reporting on the process of the Administrative Committee's first meeting electing the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen. After music was played, all members, led by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, raised their hands and swore an oath of office. The oath was as follows: "We swear with utmost sincerity to serve the people of the Northeast, to fight to the end for a peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and new Northeast. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the punishment of the people. We solemnly swear!" Amidst thunderous applause, four female representatives presented flowers to the three Chairmen, followed by a closing speech by Comrade Lin Feng. Comrade Lin Feng first warmly celebrated the first anniversary of the Northeast People's Liberation on "August 15th." When he mentioned the Northeast Anti-Japanese heroes, the Democratic United Army, and all the people of the Northeast who had sacrificed in the past fifteen years, he was too moved to speak. He then said in a spirited voice: "In order to commemorate these national heroes, we must be determined to maintain the fruits of this revolution." He then elaborated on the two major achievements of the conference, namely, the formulation of the Program for Governance and the organization of the Northeast's unified highest administrative body, hoping that the representatives would implement these resolutions among the people. Regarding future work, Comrade Lin Feng suggested that in the coming year, the broad masses of suffering people should be thoroughly liberated. We must restore industrial and commercial construction and prepare for next year's great production campaign. He called for a thorough transformation of the old regime from top to bottom, the construction of a new order, initially achieving unified taxation, solving the national economic and troop supply problems, eliminating all impoverished people (missing number), eliminating the influence of all old ideas, and the bureaucratic system and bureaucratic style of the puppet regime. Finally, he pointed out that the day the Administrative Committee took office was the beginning of shouldering the heavy responsibility of seeking happiness for the forty million people, and therefore it must serve the people with utmost care. During free speeches, Mr. Che Xiangchen was the first to step onto the stage. He said: Personally, I am a non-partisan person, and my only belief is democracy, and I will not hesitate to sacrifice my blood and head for democracy. Comrade Wan Yi then, in his capacity as a veteran Northeast soldier, told the elders about the situation of wandering inside the pass for the past fourteen years, being oppressed and squeezed out by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and pointed out that only the Communist Party cultivated the outstanding children of the Northeast people. After "August 15th," they sent them—Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, Wan Yi, etc.—back to the elders of the Northeast to serve the people of their hometown. The speakers continued with Chen Yi, the General Political Representative of the Democratic United Army, and Wu Junyan, an old Kuomintang member. The conference closed after passing a temporary motion proposed by Mr. Chen Xianzhu, tasking the Administrative Committee with the responsibility of preparing to convene the Northeast People's Representative Conference.

　　东北各省代表联席会议
　　历时九日胜利闭幕
　　行政委员会推举林枫张学思高崇民任正副主席
　　筹备召开东北人民代表大会
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】（迟到）历时九日的东北各省代表联席会议，已于八月十五日胜利闭幕，行政委员会于同日召开第一次会议，推举林枫任主席，张学思、高崇民（民主同盟东北总支部负责人、安东省政府主席）任副主席。全体行政委员在闭幕典礼上隆重宣誓就职，同时热烈庆祝“八一五”东北人民解放周年纪念日。是日大会首由主席韩幼桐女士报告会前行政委员会第一次会议推举正副主席的经过，奏乐后，全体委员在正副主席领导下，举手宣誓就职。誓词如下：“余等誓以至诚，为东北人民服务，为争取和平民主建设繁荣的新东北奋斗到底，如有违反誓约，愿受人民制裁。谨誓！”大鼓掌声中，四位女代表向三位主席献花后，即由林枫同志致闭幕词。林枫同志首先热烈庆祝“八一五”东北人民解放一周年，当他提到十五年中牺牲了的东北抗日英雄民主联军以及一切东北人民时，激动的说不出话来。他继以昂扬的声音说：“我们为了纪念这些民族英雄，我们要下定决心，保持这个革命的果实。”接着他阐述了会议的两大成就，即制定了施政纲领，和组织了东北统一的最高行政机构，希望代表们把这些决议贯彻到人民中去。关于今后的工作，林枫同志建议，今后一年内，要使广大的受苦群众彻底翻身。要恢复工商业建设，准备明年大生产运动。他号召自上而下的彻底改造旧政权，建设新的秩序，初步作到统一税收，解决国民经济和部队供给问题，消灭一切贫民（中缺数字），肃清一切旧观念的影响，和伪政权的官僚制度与官僚作风。最后他指出行政委员会就职的一天，就是负起谋四千万人民幸福的重担的开始，因此要小心翼翼的为人民服务。自由讲时，车向忱先生第一个走上主席台，他说：个人是一个无党无派的人，唯一的信仰就是民主，为民主而牺牲，热血头颅在所不惜。万毅同志继以老东北军人资格，向父老们诉说过去十四年间流浪关内被国民党反动派压迫排挤的情形，指出只有共产党才把东北人民优秀子弟培植起来。“八一五”后，把他们——吕正操、张学思、万毅等送回给东北的父老，为家乡人民服务。继续讲演者有民主联军总政代表陈沂，及老国民党员吴俊彦等。大会在通过陈先舟先生提出之由行政委员会负责筹备召开东北人民代表大会的临时动议后闭幕。
