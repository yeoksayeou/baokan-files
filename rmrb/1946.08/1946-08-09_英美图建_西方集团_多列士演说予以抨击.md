　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 6th: Paris Radio: French Deputy Prime Minister and General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, criticized the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany in a speech in Pitiers near Lyon on the 4th, as an attempt to establish a "Western Bloc." Thorez said: The "Western Bloc" will give Nazism a chance to revive. The security of France cannot be based on the establishment of mutually opposed blocs, but only on the close unity and cooperation between large and small countries. We insist on the security of our eastern border and fair reparations. Germany should supply the coal, livestock, and machinery necessary for our reconstruction work. We must insist that the Ruhr be placed under international co-management politically and economically. Our country must obtain privileges over the Rhineland and merge the Saar into our economic and monetary system.

　　英美图建“西方集团”多列士演说予以抨击
    【新华社延安六日电】巴黎广播：法副总理法共总书记多列士四日在里昂附近的皮第艾维演说中，批评德境英美占领区之经济合并为企图成立“西方集团”之行动。多列士说：“西方集团”将予纳粹以复活之机，法国之安全不能基于建立互相对立的集团，只能基于大小国家间的亲密团结与合作。我们坚持我国东部边界的安全及公正的赔偿，德国应当输送为我国恢复工作所必需的煤、牲畜及机器。我们必须坚持鲁尔在政治上与经济上交由国际共管。我国必须获得对莱茵区的特权，并将萨尔合并于我国经济及货币制度之内。
