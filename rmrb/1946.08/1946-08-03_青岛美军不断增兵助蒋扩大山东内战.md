Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 31st: U.S. troops stationed in Qingdao have recently been continuously reinforcing their forces, constructing artillery positions, and assisting Chiang's troops in expanding the civil war in Shandong. In early June, the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet also dispatched eight warships from Shanghai. The number of U.S. troops in the city has reached 6,000. The U.S. troops originally stationed in Cangku outside the city have increased from more than 200 to more than 1,000 (not including the 96th Engineering Team constructing Cangku Airport). More than 700 U.S. troops are also stationed along the Baigou River. U.S. troops have also erected more than ten artillery pieces north of Cangku, and additional artillery positions have been built at Zhan Shan No. 5 Battery, Haipo Bridge, and other locations to cover the military operations of Chiang's 54th Army, which was transported by U.S. ships to Qingdao, to attack the Jiaodong Liberated Area. On May 28th and June 13th, the U.S. and Chiang held two farces in the city at Pier No. 3 of the Grand Harbor, called "Ship Donation Ceremonies," with the U.S. military transferring fifteen U.S. ships to Chiang's side. The second "ship donation" involved a total of eight ships, including two tank landing ships, the Zhongjian and Zhongye, two medium landing ships, the Meile and Meisong, and four infantry landing ships, the Lianzhen, Lianbi, Lianguang, and Lianhua. Some of the aforementioned ships have already sailed to the waters around Yantai and Weihaiwei to conduct military activities.
