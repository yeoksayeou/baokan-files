Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th. News: After the US-Chiang troops jointly occupied Anping Town, they continued to reinforce their troops and attacked Xianghe County in the Liberated Area in three routes, making the situation on the western front of Jidong extremely tense. The Fourteenth Sub-district of the Jidong Military Region sent a telegram to General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, requesting it to be forwarded to the Beiping Executive Headquarters to express its protest. It solemnly pointed out that if the US-Chiang troops do not withdraw from the occupied areas, the soldiers and civilians of the Liberated Area will be forced to carry out righteous self-defense, and the US-Chiang side will be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. The telegram stated: The area of over a hundred li between Tongzhou and Hexiwu on the Pingjin Highway was liberated by our sub-district's Eighth Route Army when the Japanese bandits surrendered. The US military requested to pass through, and in March of this year, it was permitted according to the instructions of the CCP member of the Executive Headquarters, Ye Jianying, and it was stipulated that a US flag should be used as a sign. Unexpectedly, the US side took advantage of this passage to make unreasonable provocations against our Liberated Area many times. On March 21, two of our scouts were shot and killed by four US soldiers traveling east from Tongzhou in a car while passing through the Pingjin Highway. On April 11, when the 21st Division of the Kuomintang 92nd Army invaded Liangji in the Tongxian Liberated Area, two cars full of US soldiers cooperated in the attack. The next day, the US troops of the division, under the pretext of "bird shooting," fired at our stationed troops. In early July, the Kuomintang army built bunkers in Hexiwu, Wuqing, and the transport vehicles were all marked with US flags. Our army has always exercised the greatest tolerance in all the above unreasonable acts of aggression, avoiding direct conflict with them and urging them to realize their mistakes. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 a.m. on July 29, seventeen cars suddenly came from Tianjin, fully loaded with armed US soldiers, with no markings on the cars, and opened fire on our troops stationed in Anping Town. When we realized that they were US troops, we avoided conflict and automatically withdrew. However, the US troops threatened with automatic weapons, forcing our troops to be unable to withdraw and forced to implement self-defense, resulting in casualties on both sides. At 3:00 p.m., another twenty cars full of Kuomintang troops came from Tianjin to reinforce, and four US planes were sent from Ping to support the attack, coordinating land and air forces to attack us fiercely. Our army reluctantly dispersed and withdrew. However, the US-Chiang troops continued to fire at the surrounding villages for as long as five hours, causing heavy damage to residents' houses. After the US-Chiang troops occupied Anping Town, they added a unit of US troops, accompanied by three tanks and more than sixty cars, cooperating with the Kuomintang 92nd Army, to invade the Xianghe Liberated Area in three routes from Anping, Matou, and Hexiwu, thus making the situation serious. Regarding the settlement of the Anping incident, the telegram demanded that the US-Chiang troops immediately withdraw from all occupied areas, apologize and compensate the Liberated Area, punish the directly responsible officers, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

　　美蒋合作三路进犯香河县
    我冀东当局提出严重抗议
    要求美蒋军立即退出侵占地区
    【新华社张家口七日电】军息：美蒋军联合侵占安平镇后，继续增兵，三路向解放区香河县进攻，冀东西线形势异常紧张。冀东军区第十四分区为此特电晋察冀军区司令聂荣臻将军，转北平执行部表示抗议，并严正指出美蒋军如不从侵占地区撤退，解放区军民将被迫进行正义自卫，由此引起的一切后果，当由美蒋方面负责。该电称：平津公路通州至河西务间百余里地区，日寇投降时即为我分区八路军解放。美军曾要求通过，今年三月经执行部中共叶剑英委员指示，予以允许，并规定需有美旗为标志，不意美方竟利用此通过之便，屡次向我解放区无理挑衅。三月二十一日，我侦察员二名通过平津公路时，突遭由通州乘汽车东开之美军四人击毙。四月十一日，国民党九十二军二十一师向通县解放区两集进犯时，有满载美军之汽车两辆配合进攻，次日，该部美军又借“打鸟”为名，向我驻扎部队射击。七月初，国民党军在武清河西务修筑碉堡，而运输汽车皆插有美旗。所有上述无理侵略事件，我军始终尽最大容忍，避免与其直接冲突，促其觉悟。讵料七月二十九日上午十一时，突有自天津开来汽车十七辆，满载武装美军，车上并无任何标志，向我安平镇驻军开枪射击。当我发现为美军时，即避免冲突自动撤退。但美军竟以自动火器威胁，逼使我军无法撤退，被迫实行自卫，双方均有伤亡。至下午三时，又有自津满载国民党军之汽车二十辆增援，并自平增援美机四架，陆空配合，向我猛犯，我军忍痛分散撤出。但美军与国民党军仍继续向周围村庄射击达五小时之久，居民房屋损失甚重。美蒋军占领安平镇后，复增加美军一部，附有坦克三辆，汽车六十余辆，配合国民党九十二军，由安平、马头、河西务分三路进犯香河解放区，事态因而严重。关于安平事件之解决，该电要求美蒋军立即撤出一切侵占地区，并向解放区赔偿道歉，处分直接负责军官，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
