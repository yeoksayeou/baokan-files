　　Intensify the Implementation of "Land to the Tiller"
    At the end of last month, more than a thousand liberated heroes, activists, and model cadres in the new district of Wu'an, based on Chairman Mao's remarks on land reform in "On Coalition Government" and Sun Yat-sen's spirit of "Land to the Tiller," conducted a county-wide inspection of the liberation movement. They decided to deepen the movement to thoroughly achieve "Land to the Tiller." After half a month of intense and widespread liquidation struggles, the great ideal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, "Land to the Tiller," has achieved initial realization. Of the 300,000 mu of land seized and exploited by landlords in the past, 250,000 mu have been returned to the peasants. Generally, peasants have obtained three to four mu of land. This news is as gratifying as the victorious reports from the front lines of self-defense. The fundamental problem of land for the peasants, which has not been solved in rural areas for thousands of years, has been solved relatively quickly and universally in Wu'an this time. This is a major event of historical significance, both in terms of liberating rural productive forces to promote New Democratic construction and in terms of guaranteeing the crushing of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's offensive through the complete victory of anti-feudalism. The process of promoting land reform and completely eliminating the rule of landlords is the process of awakening and organizing the broad masses of peasants. It will enable the broad masses of peasants to vigorously develop production on their own land and promote them to consciously take up arms to fight to defend the fruits of their liberation. Facts prove that the peasants of Wu'an are already doing this.
    The central task now facing the military and civilians of our entire border region is to mobilize all forces to strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Vigorously promoting land reform and fully mobilizing the peasants' liberation is to lay a solid mass foundation for the self-defense war. We hope that all localities can be like Wu'an, boldly approving the demands of the masses in leadership, letting the masses rise up and do it themselves, resolutely, quickly, fiercely and universally igniting the fire of liquidation and revenge, and completing the unfinished great cause of land reform in history. Some places may be affected by the war, but they should also take advantage of the gaps, seize the opportunity, and vigorously promote this movement.
    Since the Central Committee's Peasant Liberation Team went to the countryside in late June, all leading organs, schools, cadres, and students in our region have organized liberation teams to help the peasants liberate themselves, bringing the mass movement to thoroughly realize "Land to the Tiller" in our entire border region into a new stage. The movement is currently underway and has already achieved considerable results. This anticipates that this historical great cause will be completed smoothly soon. Only in this way can we completely crush the reactionaries' offensive and guarantee the victory of the patriotic self-defense war!

　　加紧贯彻耕者有其田
    上月末，武安新区一千多翻身英雄、积极分子与模范干部，根据毛主席论联合政府中土地改革及孙中山耕者有其田的精神，进行全县翻身大检查，决定深入运动，彻底作到耕者有其田，经过半个月猛烈而普遍的清算运动，已使孙中山先生的伟大理想“耕者有其田”，获得了初步实现，过去为地主掠夺剥削所兼并占有的三十万亩土地，已有二十五万亩复归农民所有，一般农民都已获得了三至四亩的土地。这个消息，是和前线自卫胜利捷报一样的可喜。数千年来农村中未能解决的一个基本问题——农民的土地问题，这次武安是比较迅速而普遍的解决了，这不论就解放农村生产力以推进新民主主义的建设来说，不论就以彻底反封建的胜利来保证粉碎卖国贼蒋介石的进攻来说，都是一件有历史意义的大事。推行土地改革，彻底消灭地主的统治，这个过程，即是广大农民的觉醒与组织的过程，它将使广大农民在自己的土地上，大力发展生产，并推动他们自觉地扛起武器，为保卫自己的翻身果实而斗争。事实证明：武安农民现在已经这样做了。
    现在摆在我们全边区军民面前的中心任务，是动员一切力量争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。大力推进土地改革，充分发动农民的翻身，就是给自卫战争打下雄厚的群众基础。我们希望各地都能像武安这样，在领导上大胆批准群众的要求，放手让群众自己起来干，坚决、迅速、猛烈而普遍地点燃起清算复仇的烈火，完成历史上未完成的土地改革的伟业。有些地方可能受到战争影响，但亦应利用空隙，抓紧时机，大力推进这一运动。
    自六月下旬，中直农民翻身队下乡后，我全区各领导机关、学校、干部及学生均纷纷组织翻身队，帮助农民翻身，使我全边区彻底实现耕者有其田的群众运动进入一新阶段。现运动正在进行，且已获得了不少成绩，这预期着这一历史伟业将很快的顺利完成，只有这样，才能彻底粉碎反动派的进攻，保证爱国自卫战争的胜利！
