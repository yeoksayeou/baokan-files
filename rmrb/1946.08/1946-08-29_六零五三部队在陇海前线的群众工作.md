　　Mass Work of the 6053rd Unit
    on the Longhai Front
    The 1st and 2nd Detachments of the 6053rd Unit achieved remarkable results in mass work during the breaks in the fighting of the Longhai Campaign.

    When the 1st Detachment of the 6053rd Unit first moved to Li Douzhuang, a "newly liberated area," they found it difficult to find housing and borrow things. Some soldiers said, "This village won't work; it will take two hundred years of education to be like the old liberated areas." When the 2nd Detachment arrived at its station, the people did not approach them.

    What could be done? Everyone knew that this was because they had been under the rule of the Kuomintang warlords for a long time and did not understand the Eighth Route Army. To achieve close unity between the army and the people, the only way was to start by improving relations with the masses. Therefore, the 1st Detachment held a military meeting, mobilizing all commanders and fighters to establish close relations with the masses. In the end, it was decided to help the masses with their work and not violate mass discipline, so that the people would be happy and satisfied. In addition to respecting the customs and habits of the masses, all commanders and fighters of the 4th and 6th Squads of the 2nd Detachment used the gaps in training to do work for the masses, and a widespread movement to help the masses with their work was launched. Cadres and soldiers of all companies competed to help the villagers carry water. An old man smiled and told everyone on the street, "My tank has never been full, and now the Eighth Route Army comrades have filled it." They helped the villagers push the mill, build walls, and clean pigsties in the hot sun. The villagers all said in unison, "Our own sons are not this good!" They helped the villagers hoe the fields on Sundays. Four soldiers of the 4th Squad of the 2nd Detachment hoed two and a half mu of turnips for the landlord in half a day. The 5th Squad and 5th Team hoed more than ten mu of land for the landlord. Comrade Huang Yuyan used his nap time to dig a circle of manure for the landlord. In short, they did their best to help with everything the masses needed.

    From their practical actions, the people's perception changed. And the people also recognized the essence of the people's army from their own experience. The masses sincerely said with gratitude, "You Eighth Route Army are really like family to us. None of us have ever seen such a good army." At the same time, they also used practical actions to thank the Eighth Route Army. They bought watermelons, made vermicelli, steamed buns, sent cigarettes, and sent dumplings. When the soldiers were sick, the landlords sent water, noodles, and chicken eggs, taking care of the sick like their own children. The women took turns helping the army sew and wash clothes every day. On rainy days, when the army had no firewood to burn, the youth in the village automatically organized to collect firewood for the army. From then on, the relationship between the army and the people became closer and closer. (Zhou Ziqin)

　　六零五三部队
    在陇海前线的群众工作
    六零五三部队的一、二分队在此次陇海战役的战斗空隙中间，群众工作做出了显著的成绩。
    六零五三的一分队刚移防到“新解放区”李豆庄时，找房子借东西都感困难。有的战士说：“这村不行，要象老解放区那样，还得二百年教育。”二分队在到了驻地后，老百姓都不接近他们。
    这可怎么好呢？大家都知道这是因为他们长期受国民党军阀的统治，不了解八路军。要想军民亲密团结，只有从改善群众关系上着手。因此一分队就开了一个军人大会，动员全体指战员要和群众建立亲密关系。最后决定帮助群众工作，不违犯群众纪律，使老百姓高兴满意。二分队四、六小队全体指战员除了尊重群众的风俗习惯外，还利用整训空隙给群众做活，普遍展开了帮助群众做活的运动。各连干部战士都争先恐后的帮助老乡挑水。一个老头在街上笑嘻嘻的逢人便说：“我家的缸从来没满过，这一下也叫八路同志挑满了。”他们在火热的太阳下，帮老乡推磨、垒墙。掏猪圈，老乡们都异口同声的说：“自己的儿子也没有这么好呀！”他们在星期日突击帮助老乡锄地。二分队四班四个战士半天给房东点了二亩半萝卜。五小队五班给房东锄了十几亩地，黄玉彦同志利用午睡时间，给房东掘了一圈粪。总之，凡是群众的事情，他们都尽力帮助。
    从他们的实际行动中，转变了老百姓的观感。而且老百姓也从他亲身的经历中认识了人民军队的本质。群众都真心感激地说：“你们八路军真是和我们象一家人，我们谁也没看见过象你们这样好的军队。”同时他们也用实际行动感谢八路军，他们买西瓜，做粉条，蒸馒头，送纸烟，送饺子。战士病了，房东送水，送面条，送鸡子，照护病号象对待自己的孩子。妇女们每天轮流帮军队缝洗衣服，在下雨天，部队没柴烧，村子里的青年都自动的组织起来，给军队拾柴。从此军民关系愈益亲密。（周子芹）
