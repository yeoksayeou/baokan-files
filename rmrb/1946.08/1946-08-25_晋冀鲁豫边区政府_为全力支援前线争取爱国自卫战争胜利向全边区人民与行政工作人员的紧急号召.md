Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government
Emergency Appeal to All People and Administrative Staff in the Border Region to Fully Support the Frontlines and Strive for Victory in the Patriotic Self-Defense War

　　Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army is pressing forward and has invaded our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. An unprecedented large-scale civil war has spread and is burning across the country.

　　Fellow elders and brothers of the entire border region! Administrative comrades of the entire border region! Let us all mobilize urgently and do the following tasks well to fully support the frontlines and fight for the victory of the frontlines.

　　(1) Organize war service work with the greatest strength, organize transport teams, stretcher teams, and rescue teams; ensure the supply of food to the troops; transport and supply weapons and ammunition; rescue and treat the wounded and sick, and clean up the battlefield after the battle. Women should take care of the wounded and sick as if they were their own family members, and make military shoes strong and durable so that the army does not have shoe problems. Administrative comrades must ensure the mobilization and supply of manpower and materials for the war. Organize well and minimize waste. Militiamen, self-defense team members, and all the people should actively participate in the war. Ensure that the frontlines do not feel any difficulties, so that our army can fight with peace of mind and win battles frequently.

　　(2) District and village cadres must stick to their posts in wartime and help the troops solve all difficulties. All the people should support their own army and help the troops solve living difficulties such as oil, vegetables, and firewood. Ensure that the troops can eat during combat. Economic departments, public and private businesses at all levels should pay attention to stabilizing prices, strictly prohibiting unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating; stabilize finance and stabilize the wartime economy. Governments at all levels should do a good job in preferential treatment and support for the families of soldiers and martyrs. Launch labor support movements, mobilize the people to support the army, and work together for the victory of the war.

　　(3) Cultural and educational departments should strengthen propaganda work, encourage the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the war, disseminate victory news in a timely manner, and enhance fighting courage. In areas affected by the war, students should organize to participate in propaganda, comfort, and rescue work, and earnestly serve for the victory of the war.

　　(4) Under any circumstances, the mass emancipation movement must be implemented, and it must not be relaxed in the slightest due to the urgency of the war. This is an important guarantee for winning the war. Strive to practice production and thrift, pay attention to cherishing the people's strength, and develop various agricultural, industrial, and sideline productions. Oppose corruption and waste, practice frugality, and use all strength to support the frontlines. Promote the model of combining war and production, and mobilize women and semi-labor forces to participate in production to support the long-term struggle.

　　(5) Strengthen rear area security work. Militias, self-defense teams, and local governments should be responsible for maintaining local order, strengthening sentry checks, preventing the infiltration of special agents and spies, and maintaining the tranquility of the rear area.

　　(6) This war is of great importance to the safety of our entire liberated area, the well-being of the people of the whole country, and the future of the country and the nation; we must defeat the reactionaries' offensive. Our goal in combat is to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, so sometimes we do not focus on the gains and losses of one city or one place. Some areas may be temporarily occupied by the reactionary army, and we must be fully prepared ideologically. In any place that is temporarily occupied, the remaining cadres should combine with local armed forces, militias, and the entire population to launch widespread guerrilla warfare. Disrupt the reactionary army's transportation, kill and wound the enemy, and finally cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy.

　　(7) Finally, we call on all regions and comrades to launch a work competition, a kill-the-enemy competition, to formulate work plans, to launch competition movements, and to create many mass work models and kill-the-enemy heroes.

　　Victory will surely belong to the broad masses of the people.

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府
　　为全力支援前线争取爱国自卫战争胜利向全边区人民与行政工作人员的紧急号召
    蒋介石反动大军，正着着进逼并已侵入我晋冀鲁豫边区，空前大规模内战已在全国各地蔓延燃烧着。
    全边区的父老同胞们！全边区的行政工作同志们！大家紧急动员起来，把下列几件工作做好，以全力支援前线，一切为着前线的胜利而斗争。
    （一）以最大的力量组织战争勤务工作，组织运输队、担架队、救护队；要保证部队的粮食供给；武器弹药的运输补给；伤病员的救护医治，战斗后的打扫战场。妇女看护伤病员，要如对自己家人一样的看护，做军鞋要牢固结实，使军队不致发生鞋子困难。行政工作同志，要保证参战人力物力的动员供给。要组织的好而又少浪费。民兵自卫队员和全体人民，都应踊跃参战。要保证前方不感到一点困难，使我们军队安心作战，经常打胜仗。
    （二）区村干部在战争情况下，必须坚持岗位工作，帮助部队解决一切困难。全体人民要拥护自己的军队，帮助部队解决油、菜、柴火等生活上的困难。保证部队在战斗中能吃上饭。各级政府经济部门公私商号要注意平抑物价，严禁奸商囤积居奇；稳定金融，稳定战时经济。各级政府更要把优抗工作做好。发动劳军运动，发动人民拥护军队，共同为战争的胜利而努力。
    （三）文教部门要加强宣传工作，鼓动群众的参战热忱，及时传播胜利消息，提高斗争勇气。在战事波及地区，学生应组织参加宣传、慰劳、救护等工作，切实为战争胜利而服务。
    （四）任何情况下，要贯彻群众翻身运动，不能因战争紧迫而丝毫放松。这是争取战争胜利的重要保证。努力厉行生产节约，注意爱惜民力，发展各种农、工、副业生产。反对贪污浪费，实行节衣缩食，以一切力量来支援前线。发扬战争与生产结合的模范，发动妇女半劳动力参加生产，以支持长期斗争。
    （五）加强后方警戒工作，民兵自卫队地方政府要负责维持地方秩序，加强岗哨盘查，防止特务奸细的混入，保持后方的安宁。
    （六）这次战争对我全解放区安危，全国人民的祸福，国家民族前途，关系至巨；我们必须打败反动派的进攻。我们在作战上，目的是要歼灭敌人的有生力量，所以有时并不在争一城一地的得失，有些地区可能暂时被反动军侵占，我们必须作充分的思想准备。凡暂时被侵占的地方，留下的干部，应该结合地方武装、民兵和全体群众，普遍展开游击战争。破坏反动军交通，杀伤敌人，最后配合主力军歼灭敌人。
    （七）最后，我们号召各地区、各同志展开一个工作竞赛，杀敌竞赛，订立工作计划，开展竞赛运动，创造出许多群众的工作模范与杀敌英雄。
    胜利是一定属于广大人民的。
                                                  八月二十一日
