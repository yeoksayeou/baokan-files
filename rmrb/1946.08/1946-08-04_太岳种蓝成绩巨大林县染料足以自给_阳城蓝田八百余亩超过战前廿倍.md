　　Taiyue's various regions have achieved significant success in indigo planting. This year, Yangcheng's planting area reached over 860 mu, exceeding twenty times the pre-war levels. Currently, various regions are actively extracting indigo dye, estimated to yield at least 70,000 jin of pure indigo. After meeting the county's own needs, approximately 20,000 jin can be exported. Nanguan Village planted 194 mu of indigo, which is expected to produce over 17,000 jin of indigo, with this income accounting for approximately 79% of the village's total actual income. The widespread indigo planting in Yangcheng this year is a result of the government's precise calculations and successful mobilization of the masses during a meeting of local experts in March, illustrating the benefits of indigo planting. In the past, indigo planting was prevalent in the garden areas of Qinshui Chengguan, but almost all of it was abandoned during the enemy's invasion. Last year, after our army liberated Yangcheng, the government called on the masses to restore their old industry. All of the more than 500 mu of garden land were planted with indigo, and it is estimated that 30 million yuan will be harvested this year.

　　[Changzhi News] Under the vigorous promotion of the Lin County government, more than 2,000 mu of indigo were planted this year, resulting in a rich harvest. This will enable the county to be self-sufficient in dyes. Lin County was originally an indigo-producing county, with a large output before the Republic of China era. Later, with the dumping of foreign indigo, it became increasingly unprofitable to plant local indigo, and it gradually disappeared. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the source of foreign indigo has been difficult to obtain, and dyes have been in severe shortage. Last winter, the dyeing price of one chi of cloth even exceeded the price of the cloth itself. Therefore, this year, the county government has vigorously promoted indigo planting, and all places with water-retaining land that could potentially be used for indigo planting have been cultivated as much as possible. As a result, indigo production has been restored.

　　太岳种蓝成绩巨大林县染料足以自给
    阳城蓝田八百余亩超过战前廿倍
    【本报阳城讯】太岳各地种蓝，已获巨大成绩。阳城今年种植面积达八百六十余亩，超过战前二十倍。日前各地正积极打靛，估计至少可出净靛七万斤，除去本县自给外，尚可输出两万斤。南关村种蓝一百九十四亩，可产靛一万七千余斤，此项收入约占全村实收入的百分之七十九。阳城今年普遍种蓝，是三月间全县各行能手座谈会上，政府以精确计算，打通群众思想，说明种蓝有利的结果。沁水城关园地，过去盛行种蓝，在敌寇侵犯期间几乎全部荒芜，去年我军解放阳城，政府号召群众恢复旧业，五百多亩园地全数种蓝，估计今年可收获三千万元。
    【长治讯】林县经县府极力提倡，今年种靛二千余亩，收获颇丰。可使全县染料自给自足。林县原为产靛县份，民国以前产量甚大。后洋靛倾销，种土靛日益无利，遂告绝迹。抗战以来洋靛来源困难，染料奇缺，去冬染布一尺染价竟超过布价，故今年县府提倡种靛甚力，凡有水地可能种靛地方，都尽量设法栽培，因此靛产又形恢复。
