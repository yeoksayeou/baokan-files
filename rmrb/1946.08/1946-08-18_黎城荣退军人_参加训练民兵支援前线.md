　　Retired Veterans in Licheng
    Participate in Militia Training to Support the Front Lines
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] More than 400 retired veterans in Licheng County, after holding a conference at the end of last month to study the current situation, are now actively participating in the training of local armed forces, and promoting and mobilizing the masses to carry out county-wide work such as eliminating traitors and anti-spies, and rear production. Some said: "We cannot think that the revolution is successful after being discharged from the army, we must continue to participate in the work in the future." Some said: "My body is too weak to participate in the war, I will step up production in the rear to support the front lines." Some demobilized soldiers said: "In the future, I will train the militia and lead the militia to fight."... Everyone believes that in the anti-civil war, we should strengthen unity and take the lead, and concentrate our strength to deal with the reactionaries. The conference closed in a warm and tense atmosphere.

　　黎城荣退军人
    参加训练民兵支援前线
    【本报长治讯】黎城县四百多位荣退军人自上月底召开大会，研究了目前时局后，现正积极参加训练地方武装，宣传动员群众进行全县除奸反特务与后方生产等工作。有人说：“我们不能以为退了伍就算革命成功了，以后还要参加工作。”有人说：“我身体太弱，不能参战，我要在后方加紧生产，支援前线。”有的复员军人说：“今后我还要训练民兵，带领民兵作战。”……大家都认为在反内战中应加强团结，起带头作用。集中力量对付反动派。大会在热烈紧张的空气中闭幕。
