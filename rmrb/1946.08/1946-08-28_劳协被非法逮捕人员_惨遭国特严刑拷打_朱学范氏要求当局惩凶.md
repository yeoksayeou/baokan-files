Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: According to Chongqing newspapers, regarding the forced takeover of the Labor Association: At 7:00 AM on August 6th, representatives from the KMT-controlled "Chongqing General Labor Union" suddenly arrived at the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association, leading over 200 fully armed military police, plainclothes agents and forcibly took over the Labor Association office and its affiliated worker welfare center, labor hospital, nursery, worker cultural service center, and art studio. Traffic was cut off, and police were densely deployed, as if facing a major enemy. Thirty-eight Labor Association personnel were arrested, including Ms. Zhou Ying, director of the association's worker welfare center, and Zhao Shuwen, director of the labor hospital. They were taken to the Chongqing Municipal Criminal Police Department on trumped-up charges of organizing an "assassination squad," and tortured to extract confessions. Shi Yiwu, an unemployed worker and Labor Association member, had four front teeth knocked out. Worker Chen Daoquan suffered severe injuries from clubbing. Tang Xiangjie, head of the welfare center's service group, was also beaten with clubs. The arrested personnel were subjected to abuse and went on a hunger strike in protest. At 7:00 PM on August 8th, Zhou Ying and 27 others were escorted to the local court by plainclothes agents and armed soldiers. At 5:00 PM on August 10th, plainclothes agents with guns coerced the Daliangzi Labor Association welfare center to hand over account books and safe deposit box keys, and seized documents, seals, and Ms. Zhou Ying's personal seal in an attempt to forge documents and frame the arrested personnel, in order to cover up their violent act of seizing the Labor Association.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Shanghai News: Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, held a reception for the press in Shanghai on the 8th regarding the KMT authorities' forcible seizure of the Chongqing Labor Association. After reporting the details of the incident, Mr. Zhu pointed out that a week before the incident, the *Laosheng Bao* (Labor Voice), run by Deng Faqing, the person in charge of the Chongqing General Labor Union (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek controlled labor union), fabricated news that the Labor Association was organizing an assassination squad with ulterior motives. When the incident occurred, the various institutions of the Chongqing Labor Association, located more than 20 *li* apart, were simultaneously seized by illegal armed forces. All these signs indicate that it was undoubtedly a planned action. Regarding the organization and activities of the association, Mr. Zhu said: The Labor Association was established in Shanghai in February 1935. In 1939, it joined the International Labor Federation. In 1944, it co-sponsored the organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions with the British, French, and Soviet Trade Unions and the American Industrial Union, and was elected Vice-Chairman of the Congress. The Labor Association is the only organization in China for workers to participate in the international labor movement. To date, the Labor Association includes more than 9,000 units with 2,175,177 members. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led the National Workers' Anti-Japanese General Association, organized workers to participate in the anti-Japanese war, and assisted 4,130 military transportation technicians. The Association has established various worker welfare organizations in Chongqing, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. Mr. Zhu also said: The Labor Association has suffered attacks more than once in the ten years since its establishment. Last year, representatives of the Labor Association were unreasonably arrested in Guangzhou, and they were threatened to stop activities in Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. Finally, Mr. Zhu, on behalf of the Shanghai General Labor Association, made three demands to the authorities: release the arrested, punish the perpetrators, and guarantee protection in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Shanghai News: Ms. Zhou Ying, Director of the Chongqing Office of the China Labor Association and Director of the Worker Welfare Center, and 27 others are still being held in prison. The Shanghai General Association has received letters from them in prison, requesting assistance in rescuing them. It is reported that Zhou Ying and others are currently imprisoned in a dark room of only ten feet square, and are being subjected to abuse. The agents are also forcing everyone to do hard labor. Zhou Ying's ten-year-old child is also among those arrested and is forced to make a pair of cloth shoe soles every day; failure to do so results in severe whipping.

    【新华社延安二十四日电】据重庆报纸报导劳协被强占经过称：八月六日晨七时，渝市中国劳动协会办事处突来国民党官办“重庆总工会”代表，率领军警便衣特务二百余人，全副武装，强行接收劳协办事处及附属之工人福利社、劳工医院、托儿所、工人文化服务社、美工堂等机构，一时交通断绝，岗警密布，如临大敌，并逮捕劳协人员三十八人，包括该会工人福利社主任周颖女士及劳工医院院长赵书文等，先后押至渝市刑事警察处，诬以组织“暗杀团”之莫须有罪名，并曾动刑逼供。失业工人、劳协会员再瑞武被打脱门牙四颗，工人陈道全遭受棍打重伤，福利社服务组长汤湘洁亦受棍击。被捕人员身受虐待，曾绝食反抗。八日下午七时，周颖等二十八人才由便衣特务及武装士兵押解移送地方法院。十日下午五时，大梁子劳协福利社复被便衣特务持枪威迫交出账册、保险箱钥匙，抢去社中文卷图记及周主任（周颖）私章，企图伪造证件，诬陷被捕人员，以掩饰其强占劳协之暴行。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏为国民党当局强占渝劳协事件，八日在沪招待新闻界。朱氏在报告事件经过后，指出事件发生前一周，渝市总工会（按即蒋方御用工会）负责人邓发清所主办的《劳声报》，即捏造劳协组织暗杀团图谋不轨之消息。事件发生之时，渝劳协各机构相距二十余里，均于同时为非法武装强占。由此种种迹象观之，乃为有计划无疑。谈及该会之组织及活动，朱氏称：劳协在民国二十四年二月成立于上海，民国二十八年加入国际劳工联合会，一九四四年会同英法苏总工会与美国产业工会发起组织世界工会联合会，当选大会副主席。劳协为中国工人参加国际工运之唯一组织，迄目前止，劳协所属包括九千多单位，拥有会员二百一十七万五千一百七十七人。抗战后曾领导全国工人抗敌总会，组织工人参加抗战工作，先后协助军运技工四千一百三十人。该会在重庆及西安兰州均设立各种工人福利组织。朱氏并称：劳协成立十年来，工作遭受打击不止一次，去年劳协代表在广州被无理追捕，在汉口、天津及各地亦被威胁停止活动。最后朱氏代表上海劳协总会向当局提出释放、惩凶及今后保障三项要求。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：中国劳协渝办事处职员及工人福利社主任周颖女士等二十八人，迄今犹被押狱中。上海总会已接获彼等自狱中所寄出之信件，要求设法营救。据悉：周颖等现被囚于方圆仅十尺之暗室内，备受虐待，特务并强迫各人做苦工。周颖之十余岁孩子亦在被捕之列，每天并被罚做布鞋底一双，如违则惨受鞭打。
