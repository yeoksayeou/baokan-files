Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily carried a dispatch stating: After the Kuomintang authorities took over He County (Anhui Province), they indulged in exorbitant taxes and levies. Before the "tax exemption" order reached He County, the county government had already exacted 100,000 shi of grain from the people in advance, which was far more than the land tax itself. After the order arrived, they implemented a disguised grain levy under the name of "requisition." In March, they forcibly bought grain at the officially stipulated price of 3,000 yuan per shi, and only disbursed the payments when the rice price rose to around 30,000 yuan. Moreover, the township chiefs, bao chiefs, and even the township people's representatives engaged in corruption at every level, and levied additional taxes on the people due to uneven distribution of the spoils. The people of He County suffered greatly from the ravages of the enemy and puppet troops and the Kuomintang army's searches and plunder. However, they considered the actions of the New Fourth Army when it was stationed there as a miracle and expressed a longing for them. Ordinary citizens and farmers said, "The New Fourth Army never loved money, paid for what they bought, never took or borrowed by force, returned what they borrowed, compensated for what they damaged, filled the water jar before leaving after using the water, and swept the residential houses clean when they departed; they engaged in production to reduce the burden on the people, helped the people with farming, implemented rent and interest reduction, and recalled all the Dajiang notes (currency used by the New Fourth Army) before withdrawing, so as not to let the common people suffer." The people said, "Only the New Fourth Army is the real people's army."

    不堪蒋政权横征暴敛和县人民怀念新四军
    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪文汇报载通讯称：国民党当局接收和县（皖省属）后，尽情横征暴敛，县政府于“免征田赋”政令到达和县以前，就预先向人民苛征十万石，单这项就比田赋多得多，及至政令到达以后，又在“征购”名义下，实行变相的征粮。在三月间用官方规定每石三千元的价格强买，直至米价涨到三万元上下时，才拨付款项，且乡长保长甚至乡民代表，层层舞弊，因分赃不均，又向老百姓加征。和县人民饱受敌伪军的蹂躏与国民党军的搜刮掳掠，但对新四军驻扎该地时的所作所为认为是奇迹，流露追恋之情。一般市民和农民都说：“新四军从不爱钱，买东西给钱，不强拿强借，借东西还原，弄坏了照赔，用了水临走挑满一缸，住民宅开拔时打扫干净；自己生产减轻人民负担，还帮人民耕种，实行减租减息，撤退前就将大江票（新四军所用之票）全部收回，以免老百姓吃亏”。老百姓说：“只有新四军才是真正的人民军队。”
