Anti-"Sixty Jin" and "Political Siege"
    Jin Sha, Zhu Xiang

    The most hated reactionary force of the people of Yuanqu was the "Sixty Jin." This originated from the enemy puppet regulations: pseudo-village "cadres" could extort sixty jin of fine grain from the masses each month, and the masses collectively called these bad people "Sixty Jin." Some people ate several sixty jin, called "Big Sixty Jin." Almost all of these people were local bullies and feudal landlords, who relied on enemy power in the village to make a fortune, arbitrarily detaining and hanging up the masses, or accusing the masses of "communicating with the Eighth Route Army," sending them to the enemy to be shot or buried alive. A Yuanqu folk song says: "Not afraid of King Yama, just afraid of Sixty Jin."

    Yuanqu County Town was a stronghold of traitors, spies, and feudal landlords, and the headquarters of all the large and small "Sixty Jin" in the county. Yao Huaisheng and Yao Hesheng, nephews of the big landlord Yao Sen, served as the chief of the Finance and Grain Section and the chief of the Construction Section of the pseudo-county government, respectively, and were the main founders of the "Sixty Jin" system. They often personally led people to the countryside to force grain and money, detaining and beating people, and taking large amounts of bribes. When Tanjiacun suffered a famine the year before last, because they had no money to bribe them, they were "promoted" from a third-class village to a first-class village, and extorted double the amount. Many farmers had even the few grains they snatched from the locusts mouths plundered, leading to a large number of people fleeing the famine, begging for food, and starving to death.

    They also took advantage of the disaster to make usurious loans that devoured people. The most common "kettle interest": interest rates reached three sheng of wheat per month for one yuan. There was also a "sleep interest": money was lent out without urging or demanding, and when the time was right, the "interest" was suddenly calculated, and the debtor's land and property were all taken away. Yao Ganchen's lending shop "He Shang Tai" didn't know how many farmers it ruined. At that time, the folk saying was: "Not owing He Shang Tai is like being a living god." The fertile water land in the east, west, and north of Hezao Beitoutou was almost entirely in the bloody hands of the Yao, Li, and Shi families. Yao Ganchen alone plundered more than a thousand mu of good land.

    During the period when the enemy in the city and the large and small "Sixty Jin" in the county ruled Yuanqu, more than 19,200 people out of the county's population of 60,000 were killed, murdered, forced to death, or starved to death. In the second district, with a population of 20,000, the population was reduced by half due to death and escape. In an ancient well in the district, more than 200 peasant corpses were found, bloody and horrible. Many rural fields became a desolate world where roads were broken and people were scarce, and weeds were taller than houses. The only hope of the people of Yuanqu was that the Eighth Route Army would come to take revenge. The masses in the Tanjiacun area said: "The Eighth Route Army will come to settle accounts!" This represents the voice of the people of the whole county.

    After our army liberated Yuanqu last year, it resoundingly put forward the slogan of anti-"Sixty Jin." The revolutionary movement of the people of the whole county against "Sixty Jin" was kicked off with a memorial service for the martyrs who died during the War of Resistance and a public trial of the traitor Liu Yanlin, and it was in full swing. The masses forgot the wind and snow of December, forgot fatigue and hunger, and launched struggles in various places day and night without rest. Villages such as Dongxihezao, Gaoluo, and Gao Yige were fighting even on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Many "Sixty Jin" deeply lowered their heads and begged the masses to spare their humble lives. Some stubborn guys were made to wear tall hats and paraded through "nine villages" and "four gates," shouting their own crimes. Most of them readily admitted to compensating the masses for all losses. The masses, holding swords and guns, went out in groups, in the middle of the night, to capture secret agents, even chasing them to Wenxi, Xiaxian, Yangcheng and other places, and brought them back for struggle and public trial. A large number of documents and contracts were pasted into "thousand-jin pagodas" (symbolizing the heavy pressure suffered by the peasants) and burned in parades and demonstrations. Many villages established "Liberation Days" and created liberation operas, with gongs and drums beating loudly, celebrating the new life. By March, 71 of the 77 villages in the county had entered the climax of the movement.

    The rule of the "Sixty Jin" in the countryside collapsed, but the ruling stronghold of traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords in the city still weighed heavily on the people. Some put seals on their doors, and they had automatically carried out fake struggles that stole the sky and changed the sun, saying that they had been "liquidated," but the eyes of the people were discerning and could not be deceived. In March, more than 300 people from the seven villages led by Tanjiacun went to the city to settle accounts with the landlords Yao, Xi, and Li families. At this time, the traitor landlords were prepared. On the one hand, they forced the restaurants in the streets not to sell food to the masses of the seven villages, claiming to starve these 300 people to death. On the other hand, Wang Xinheng, the head of the special agents, used the struggle against "Sixty Jin" Zhao Zhenhua as a pretext to deceive more than 600 people from the five riverside villages of Dongtan and Saili, and armed them to enter the city. They fabricated news, telling these 600 people that the villagers of the seven villages were bandits and wanted to "rob" the landlords, so that other villages could not reduce rent and clear debts; after provocation, they threatened them with "whoever leaves will be fined." Finally, led by the special agents, the masses of the seven villages were locked in a large courtyard and besieged. The "Sixty Jin" stood guard at all intersections, not allowing pedestrians to enter or leave. The masses of the seven villages were drenched in cold rain, enduring hunger and cold, waiting for reinforcements. The traitorous special agent landlords, fearing that the masses would not freeze and starve to death for a while, led the crowd to shout and curse loudly, throwing bricks and stones into the courtyard, causing many people to be cut and bleed.

    This situation continued for a day and a night, and the reactionary ferocity reached its peak. The county government and the county farmers association, located outside the city, learned that the masses of the seven villages were surrounded and immediately issued an emergency call to the peasants of the whole county to promote class friendship, support the masses of the seven villages, and attack the reactionary stronghold in the city. The peasants shouted slogans such as "Farmers of the world are one family," "Saving others is saving ourselves," and "Not letting the landlords and secret agents harm their own brothers," and more than 5,000 people automatically picked up various weapons and organized propaganda teams, combat teams, search teams, and transport teams to surround and advance towards Yuanqu City. On March 29, three columns of the peasant army, in a mighty manner, arrived at the outskirts of the city overnight. Two thousand people were deployed along the Yellow River to maintain vigilance, preparing to strike at the stubborn army on the opposite bank at any time, and three thousand people, holding torches high, climbed the walls and entered the city. The city head of Yuanqu suddenly shone with light. The "Sixty Jin" fled, hid, and even disappeared without a trace. After the peasants merged with the surrounded masses of the seven villages, they immediately separated to search. People armed with guns and torches were running everywhere in the streets and alleys, and Yaojia Lane (i.e., Landlord Lane) was even more crowded with people.

    For the first time, the peasants, as masters, opened and entered the black lacquered gate of the big landlord Yao Ganchen, and entered the lending shop "He Shang Tai." They smashed the "ticket plates" for printing paper money into pieces, and tore the famous paintings with sandalwood inlaid edges. Eating high-quality grain and living in high-rise buildings, they shouted, "This is all our blood! You've enjoyed enough!"

    Ten thousand bright eyes and strong hands searched out the trembling traitor Yao Hesheng, the special agent Wang Xinheng and other leading figures, and more than a dozen lackeys such as Yang Dengyun, from the caves. After four consecutive days of large-scale joint accusations, the two main criminals - the enemy agent and national agent Yao Hesheng and Wang Xinheng - were executed according to law under public trial by the masses, and the secondary lackeys confessed and repented. For those who confessed well, the masses shouted: "Be lenient with him!"

    The victorious peasants were extremely happy! Meetings were held during the day and operas were performed at night. The troupes and propaganda teams of various villages put this struggle on the stage for public performance. "Special agents armed to surround and beat the masses" and "bad people sabotage, good people are deceived" on the stage, and "Yao Huaisheng's crimes" in Shangzhuang, deeply educated the masses themselves. In particular, the masses of the five riverside villages who had been deceived said after seeing these operas that they had previously been "stuck in a gourd, unable to distinguish between enemies and friends."

    What the peasants of Yuanqu are most proud of is not only that the reactionary ruling clique of Yuanqu City was completely smashed, but even the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-army on the opposite bank of the Yellow River, which often harassed and strafed us, was frightened and did not dare to fire a single shot for four days and four nights. Although the masses' gongs and drums were loud, singing loudly, and the torches were burning red in the sky, the target was very prominent and clear. When they mentioned this victorious joint struggle, a victorious smile appeared on their faces, and together with the military siege when the Eighth Route Army liberated Yuanqu last September, it was resoundingly called "political siege."

　　反“六十斤”与“政治攻城”
    金沙、朱襄
    垣曲人民最痛恨的反动势力是“六十斤”。原来依照敌伪规定：伪村“干部”每人每月可向群众盘剥六十斤细粮，群众统称这些坏人为“六十斤”。其中有一人吃好几个六十斤的，称为“大六十斤”。这些人几乎全部都是恶霸及封建地主，在村里倚仗敌势，大发洋财，随意扣押吊打群众，或者给群众扣上个“通八路”的罪名，送到敌人手里，枪毙或活埋。垣曲民谣说：“不怕阎罗王，就怕六十斤。”
    垣曲县城，是汉奸、特务、封建地主的堡垒，是全县大小“六十斤”的首脑部。大地主姚森的侄子姚怀生、姚和生，分任伪县府财粮科长与建设科长，是“六十斤”制度的主要创始者。他们时常亲自率人下乡，逼粮逼款，扣人打人，从中掠取大量的贿赂。谭家村前年灾荒时，因无钱买贿他们，被从三等村“提升”为头等村，加倍勒索，许多农民连从煌虫嘴里抢出来的几颗粮食都被掠夺一空，以致大批逃荒、讨饭、饿毙。
    他们更利用灾荒，大放吃人的高利贷。最普遍的“棵儿利”：利率有达到一块钱一月三升麦子的。另外有一种“磕睡利”：放出钱去，不催不讨，待到一定时机，突然“加利”一算，将债户土地财产一齐算光。姚干臣开设的放账铺“和尚泰”，不知“坑”穷了多少农民。当时民谚说：“不欠和尚泰，就是活神仙。”东、西河糟北堡头一带的肥沃水地，几乎全部落在姚家、李家、师家的血手了。只姚干臣一家掠得好地就在千亩以上。
    在城内敌人和全县大小“六十斤”统治垣曲时期，全县六万人口，竟有一万九千二百多人被屠杀、暗害、逼死、饿死。二区两万人口，连死带逃减少一半，该区一古井内，曾发现农民尸首二百多具，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。好多农村田野，变成了路断人稀，野草与房屋比高的荒凉世界。垣曲人民唯一的希望，就是八路军来了报仇。潭家村一带群众说：“八路军来了算账！”这代表着全县人民的心声。
    我军于去年解放垣曲后，响亮提出反“六十斤”的口号。全县人民反“六十斤”的革命运动，以两万群众追悼抗战期间死难烈士及公审汉奸刘延林为序幕，如火如荼地开展起来。群众忘记了腊月的风雪，忘记了疲劳与饥饿，夜以继日，丝毫不休息地在各地展开了斗争。东西河槽、皋落、高倚阁等村，则连大年初一都在斗争。许多“六十斤”深深地低下了头，请求群众保留他们卑贱的生命。有些顽固家伙被戴上高帽游“九村”，“游四门”，自己喊自己的罪状。多数都满口承认赔偿群众一切损失。群众拿着宝剑和刀枪，成群结队，半夜三更的四出捕捉特务，甚至追到闻喜、夏县、阳城等地，把他们抓了回来，进行斗争与公审。大量的文书契约，被糊成“千斤塔”（象征农民所受重压），烧毁于游行示威之中。许多村庄订立了“翻身日”，创作出翻身戏，锣鼓喧天，庆祝着新生。至阳历三月，全县七十七村有七十一村进入运动高潮。
    农村中的“六十斤”统治垮台了，但城内的汉奸恶霸、封建地主统治堡垒，却仍然沉重地压在人民身上。有的把门上贴了封条，他们曾自动进行偷天换日的假斗争，说是已经“清算”过了，但人民的眼睛是雪亮的，欺骗不了的。三月，以谭家村为首的上七村群众三百多人，进城找姚家、席家、李家地主算账。此时，汉奸地主们早有准备，一面强迫各街饭铺不准卖饭给上七村群众，声言要饿死这三百多人，一面由特务头子王新恒借斗争“六十斤”赵振华为名，欺骗了东滩、塞里等沿河五村群众六百余人，拿着武器入城。他们捏造消息，告诉这六百多人说，上七村的庄户是土匪，要“抢劫”地主，使别村不能减租清债；挑拨之后，又以“谁走就罚谁”来威吓，最后由特务带头，把上七村群众关到一个大院，围困起来。各路口都由“六十斤”站了岗，不准行人出入，上七村群众被冷雨淋着，忍冻受饿的等待援军。汉奸特务地主们生怕群众一时冻饿不死，乃率众高喊大骂，向院里打砖块，打石头，打得好些群众皮破血流。
    这局面延续了一天一夜，反动凶焰达到了顶点。住在城外的县政府、县农会获悉上七村群众被围消息，立即紧急号召全县农民发扬阶级友爱，支援上七村群众，向城内反动堡垒进攻。农民们喊着“天下农民是一家”、“救别人就是救自己”、“不让地主特务伤害自己的兄弟”的口号，五千多人自动拿起各种武器，组织了宣传队、战斗队、搜索队、运输队，向垣曲城包围前进。三月二十九日，三路农民大军浩浩荡荡，连夜进抵城郊。两千人在黄河沿岸布好警戒，准备随时打击对岸的顽军，三千人高擎火把，爬墙进城，垣曲城头，顿放光明。“六十斤”们窜的窜，藏的藏，连影子也不见了，农民们与被包围的上七村群众汇合之后，即刻分头进行搜索。大街、小巷到处奔流着荷枪实弹的人群与火把，姚家巷（即地主巷）内，更是人山人海，挤的水泄不通。
    农民第一次以主人的姿态打开并进入大地主姚干臣的黑漆大门，进入放账铺“和尚泰”。他们把印刷纸币的“票版”摔成碎块，把檀香木镶边的名画也撕裂了”。吃着上等的粮食，住着高楼大厦，他们嚷叫着：“这都是咱的血呀！你们受用够了！”
    一万只雪亮的眼和有力的手，从地洞里，把混身发抖的汉奸姚和生、特务王新恒等首脑人物与狗腿杨登云等十余人搜捕出来了。经过连续四天大规模的联合控诉，两个主要罪犯——敌特兼国特姚和生和王新恒在群众公审下，依法处决，次要的狗腿们纷纷坦白悔过。对于坦白得好的，群众高喊：“宽大了他！”
    胜利了的农民欢喜极了！白天开会，晚上演戏。各村的剧团、宣传队，纷纷将这次斗争搬上舞台公演。上登板的“特务武装围打群众”、“坏人破坏、好人上当”，上庄的“姚怀生的罪恶”，都深深地教育了群众自己。特别是曾经受骗的沿河五村群众，在看到这些戏后，都说自己从前是“被装在葫芦里，分不清敌人和朋友”。
    垣曲农民最骄傲的，不仅是垣曲城的反动统治集团完全被粉碎，而且连黄河对岸经常向我们扰乱扫射的蒋伪军，都吓得整整四天四夜没敢放一枪。尽管群众锣鼓喧天，高歌欢叫，火把燃得满空通红，目标非常地突出与显明。他们一提起这次胜利的联合斗争，脸上就涌出胜利的微笑，和去年九月八路军解放垣曲时的军事攻城连在一起，响亮地称为“政治攻城”。
