　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: CCP member of the Executive Headquarters, Ye Jianying, received a memorandum from Kuomintang member Zheng Jiemin on the morning of the 19th, stating: Kuomintang troops will take free action against Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an to aid Kuomintang troops in the Datong area. The CCP side stated: Since late June, Chiang's troops have been attacking various liberated areas, occupying 20 county towns and 150 important market towns. Chiang Kai-shek has made five demands to the CCP: to cede the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, to cede the Jiaoji Railway, to cede Chengde and the area south of Chengde, to cede most of the Northeast, and to cede the areas in Shandong and Shanxi liberated by the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army from the puppet troops. Chiang Kai-shek's Lushan statement on August 13th openly supported these unreasonable demands. Since then, Chiang Kai-shek's deployment for an all-out civil war has become more active and specific. Zheng Jiemin, as a government member, formally announced the intention to attack Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an, confirming that the civil war has entered a larger-scale stage, which deserves serious attention from the people of the whole country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Beiping Dispatch: At the Executive Headquarters meeting on the morning of the 17th, Fu Jiajun, the Kuomintang representative of the Military Mediation Department's Executive Office, openly declared: "If the Communist army does not lift the threat to Datong, the government army will attack Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde." The CCP side stated: Chiang Kai-shek has投入85 percent of his troops into the civil war, and Chiang's troops are launching large-scale offensives against the liberated areas everywhere. Eight divisions of Chiang's troops, in violation of agreements, crossed the river and invaded southern Shanxi, advancing north along the Tongpu Railway, and have occupied important towns such as Wenxi,Shuitou, Dongzhen, and Houma. More than 500,000 Chiang's troops in northern Jiangsu have launched a large-scale offensive, advancing more than 100 li northward along the Yangtze River from Nantong to Taixing, successively occupying seven county towns including Xiaoxian, Lingbi, Sixian, Wuhe, Tianchang, Rugao, and Haian. More than 150,000 Chiang's troops along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong have occupied nine county towns including Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Linzi, Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Changshan, and Zouping. More than 200,000 Chiang's troops in the Central Plains tore up the ceasefire agreement reached by the ninth group and are pursuing and "annihilating" the breakout troops of Li Xiannian's command everywhere. Under these circumstances, the CCP cannot sit idly by and be destroyed, so it has to fight back in other parts of northern Shanxi to stop the ferocious flames of Chiang's military civil war. If Chiang's troops stop the offensive against the above-mentioned areas and withdraw from the occupied towns and vast areas, peace in Shanxi and the whole country should not be difficult to achieve immediately; conversely, if Chiang Kai-shek persists in his errors and insists on expanding the civil war, daring to invade Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, then Chiang's side will be responsible for all consequences.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: General Li Xiannian's representatives, Zhang Wenjin and two others, rushed from their station to Xi'an a few days ago to negotiate specific implementation of the Laohekou temporary agreement with the Ninth Executive Group; unexpectedly, when passing through Yangpaomiao in Zhen'an County, they were suddenly detained by Hu Zongnan's troops of Chiang's side, and their life or death is still unknown. Chiang's side's move is to isolate Li Xiannian's troops from the Ninth Group, so as to undermine the Central Plains ceasefire agreement and implement its plan to pursue and annihilate the Central Plains troops. And the rumor that the Central News Agency has repeatedly slandered and madly clamored that General Li Xiannian did not send representatives to Xi'an has been shattered by the above facts. Regarding the unreasonable detention of Zhang Wenjin and others by Chiang's side, General Zhou Enlai of the Nanjing CCP delegation and Ye Jianying, member of the Beiping Executive Department, have lodged serious protests with the Kuomintang.

　　公然叫嚣进犯延安张垣承德
　　蒋介石疯狂扩大内战
　　中共方面严正指出：蒋如执迷不悟应负责一切后果
    【新华社延安二十一日电】执行部中共叶剑英委员十九日上午接获国民党委员郑介民备忘录一份，内称：国民党军队将对张家口、承德及延安采取自由行动，以援助大同方面国民党军队。中共方面称：自六月下旬以来，蒋军向各解放区进攻，已侵占县城二十座，重要集镇一百五十处，蒋介石向中共提出让出苏皖边区，让出胶济路，让出承德及承德以南地区，让出东北大部地区，让出山东、山西八路军新四军从伪军手中解放的地区等五项要求。蒋介石八一三庐山声明，又公开地支持这些无理要求。此后，蒋介石之全面内战的部署更加积极和具体化了，身为政府委员的郑介民正式宣布要进攻张家口、承德及延安，证实了内战已走上更大规模的阶段，值得全国人民严重注意。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】北平讯：军调部执行处国民党代表傅家骏，于十七日上午执行处会议上公开宣称：“如共军不解除对大同的威胁，政府军队将进攻延安、张家口和承德”。中共方面称：蒋介石已将其百分之八十五兵力投入内战，蒋军正在各地大举进攻解放区。违约渡河侵入晋南之蒋军八个师，正沿同蒲路北犯，已进占闻喜、水头、东镇、侯马等重要城镇。苏北蒋军出动大军五十余万，南线沿长江由南通至泰兴一线，已向北推进百余里，先后侵占萧县、灵壁、泗县、五河、天长、如皋、海安等七个县城。在山东胶济沿线十五万以上蒋军，已侵占即墨、胶县、益都、临淄、淄川、博山、章邱、长山、邹平等九个县城。在中原蒋军二十余万，撕毁第九小组获致的停战协议，正在到处追击与“围歼”中共李先念部的突围部队。在这种情况下，中共自不能束手待毙，因此不得不在晋北其他地方实行反击，以制止蒋军内战的凶焰。如果蒋军停止对上述各地的进攻，并撤出所侵占的城镇与广大地区，山西和全国当不难立即获致和平；反之，如果蒋介石执迷不悟，坚持扩大内战，胆敢向延安、张垣、承德进犯，则一切后果将由蒋方负责。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】李先念将军代表张文津等三人，日前由驻地赶赴西安，与第九执行小组商洽具体执行老河口临时协议；讵料行经镇安县之杨泡庙时，突被蒋方胡宗南部扣押，迄今生死不明。蒋方此举为欲隔绝李先念部与第九小组之联络，以便破坏中原停战协议，实行其追剿与歼灭中原部队的计划。而中央社所一再污蔑狂叫李先念将军不派代表到西安之谣言，已由上述事实击破。对张文津等被蒋方无理扣押事，南京中共代表团周恩来将军与北平执行部叶剑英委员，均已向国民党提出严重抗议。
