Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Our correspondent interviewed the renowned legal scholar Professor He Sijing about the Anping Incident. Professor He stated: To understand the truth of the Anping Incident, one must know its background. In eastern Hebei, Kuomintang-controlled areas and liberated areas were intertwined. Most areas along the Beining Railway were liberated areas, and many places along the Tianjin-Beijing Highway (such as the hundred-mile area between Wuqing and Tongxian) also passed through liberated areas. The Kuomintang authorities tried their best to keep American troops embroiled in the war to attack the liberated areas, and U.S. Marine Corps officers have always lacked respect for China's territorial sovereignty and the concept of respecting the liberated areas. For example, in Liushouying, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and other places along the Beining Railway, the U.S. Marine Corps entered the liberated areas continuously from July 1st to 17th, resulting in as many as five conflicts. In these incidents, the U.S. military, armed and without prior notification, directly entered the liberated areas, even opening fire and killing local farmers. In the eyes of the U.S. military, these actions seemed to be their due right. This reveals an abnormal mentality on the part of the U.S. military, which is not treating China as an independent country on an equal footing with the United States, but rather regarding China as a colony. Precisely because of this mentality, actions that clearly violate the sovereignty of another country according to international law and the laws of any country are considered nothing by the U.S. military. Precisely because of this mentality, the U.S. military freely enters the liberated areas for military activities, and U.S. troops arbitrarily beat people and kill people with jeeps in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all of which are considered nothing. And when the Chinese people slightly carry out legitimate self-defense, the U.S. military believes it is an attack on them and feels very unhappy. The Anping Incident is another concrete manifestation of this abnormal mentality. But they should put themselves in the shoes of the Chinese people. If similar situations occurred in the United States, and foreign troops could move freely in American territory like the U.S. troops stationed in China today, then what would the American people do? If the American people would definitely rise up in self-defense, then how can it be imagined that the people in the liberated areas, who have a high degree of national self-esteem after eight years of national anti-Japanese war, can bow their heads and allow foreigners to trample on China's sovereignty? The U.S. Marine Corps patrol, fully armed, without U.S. military markings, and without prior notification to the liberated area authorities, suddenly entered the liberated area and opened fire. In this situation, how could the Eighth Route Army not rise up in self-defense? The Kuomintang authorities have always treated the bloody cases of U.S. troops killing compatriots in major cities within their control as nothing. After the Anping Incident, the Kuomintang authorities offered condolences and mourning to the dead and wounded U.S. soldiers with meticulous care, even to the point that the Americans themselves felt somewhat strange. However, for the military and civilians who died and were injured in defending national sovereignty, they not only did not provide compensation but also cursed them as "bandits." After the Anping Incident, the Kuomintang authorities defended the U.S. side even more vigorously than the U.S. military themselves. These Chinese are more American than the Americans, just as some Americans are more Chinese than the Chinese. The Kuomintang government's position has further fueled the U.S. side's abnormal mentality of disregarding China's sovereignty and not treating the Chinese as equals.

The Kuomintang government calls itself the "National Government," but it only protects foreigners and does not protect Chinese people. Tolerating foreign troops to trample on the sovereignty of the motherland is, in legal terms, a "crime of treason" and also a "crime of endangering the state."

Professor He also stated: The Military Mediation Department has now sent a special team to investigate the Anping Incident. We hope to ascertain the truth and obtain a fair and reasonable resolution. However, unfortunately, during the investigation process, the Kuomintang side still insisted on a policy of expanding the situation, and the U.S. side did not cautiously remove its own biases because it was a party to the incident, thus making the investigation difficult. The investigation procedure proposed by the Chinese Communist side can be described as fair in terms of law, reason, and human feelings, but it was ultimately rejected. At the same time, while the three parties were discussing, the U.S. military and the Kuomintang army occupied the scene of the incident, which, in legal terms, is equivalent to destroying evidence. Especially interesting is that the U.S. side, on the one hand, denies jointly attacking the liberated areas with the Kuomintang army, but on the other hand, sends troops to occupy Anping Town, which belongs to the liberated area. This proves that the U.S. side has completely lost its neutral position in this incident and has entered a state of combat together with the Kuomintang army.

Professor He concluded: As long as the U.S. side abandons the abnormal mentality of treating China as a colony and treats the Chinese people as people who have national self-esteem like the American people; as long as the Kuomintang authorities demonstrate a minimum of national stance, the Anping Incident should be resolved appropriately and reasonably.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Beiping Dispatch: The Kuomintang side's Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Executive Department, Cai Wenzhi's, remarks on the Anping Incident, in addition to lacking any national stance and comparing China to Vietnam, also fabricated extremely absurd accounts of the incident itself. This can be proven from the materials published in the Tianjin Min Guo Daily. Regarding the location of the conflict, Cai stated that the vicinity of Anping Town was not a liberated area but a "Communist army sneaking into" the highway area to "attack the U.S. military." However, the Min Guo Daily on August 1st stated that "the incident location is within the jurisdiction of Yang Meisheng, commander of the Jin-Ji Column of the Communist army." In fact, the hundred-mile highway from Tongzhou to Wuqing has been liberated by the Eighth Route Army since the surrender of the Japanese invaders. Cai also claimed that the Communist army sneaked into the highway area, setting up obstacles and ambushes in advance, which was clearly premeditated. But the Min Guo Daily said: "The U.S. military was traveling in heavy trucks, with a jeep in the lead, driven by a Chinese driver, far from the U.S. military's heavy trucks. The jeep drove to Anping, where about 300 Communist soldiers suspected it was a National army and "immediately forced the vehicle to stop," pushing the vehicle away. At this time, the U.S. cars had already arrived and fired at the Communist soldiers, and the conflict began." It can be seen that it was not "the Communist army premeditatedly ambushing the U.S. military," but that the U.S. military fired first when detaining a jeep of unknown origin that had illegally entered the liberated area. Even more ridiculous is that Cai Wenzhi attempted to prove that "there were no National army troops in the Anping Incident" by claiming that "the U.S. military suffered so many casualties, while the National army suffered no casualties." However, according to the Min Guo Daily published on July 31st, the director of the Beiping Executive Office, Shi Chaoru, stated that the 11th War Zone Command did not send troops there, but only "local troops" assisted the U.S. military. This is the evidence that Chiang's army jointly attacked the Eighth Route Army's defense area with the U.S. Marine Corps.

　　何思敬教授谈安平事件
    美军把中国看作殖民地国民党政府犯了叛国罪
    【新华社延安十二日电】本社记者为安平事件走访名法学家何思敬教授，何教授称：要了解安平事件的真相，就必须知道这一事实的背景。在冀东，国民党统治区和解放区犬牙相错，北宁路两旁大多是解放区，而平津公路也有许多地方（如武清、通县间百余里地区）通过解放区。国民党当局尽力设法把美军留在进攻解放区之战事漩涡中，而美海军陆战队的官员们也素来缺乏尊重中国领土主权与尊重解放区的观念。例如北宁路沿线留守营、昌黎、秦皇岛等地，美海军陆战队于七月一日至十七日曾连续进入解放区，以致发生冲突共达五次之多，在这些事件中，美军带着武装，事前毫不通知迳目进入解放区，以至开枪射击，杀害当地农民。在美军看来，这些行动似乎都是他们应有的权利。这就透露了在美军方面存在着一种不正常的心理，就是不把中国当成一个和美国处于平等地位的独立国家，也就是说把中国看作殖民地。正由于这种心理，按照国际公法和任何国家的法律，明明是侵犯别国主权的行为，在美军看来都不算什么一回事。正由于这种心理，美军自由进入解放区军事，美军在国民党统治区各大城市随意殴人，开吉普车撞死人，都不算什么一回事。而当中国人稍稍进行正当的自卫时，美军就认为是对他们的攻击，而会觉到非常的不痛快。安平事件也就是这种不正常心理的又一具体表现。但是他们应当设身处地想一想，如果在美国也发生类似的情况，外国军队可以像今天驻华美军一样在美国领地自由行动，那么美国人民将怎样办呢？如果美国人民一定要起来自卫，那末怎么能设想经过八年民族抗日战争有高度民族自尊心的解放区人民能够俯首贴耳令外人蹂躏中国的主权呢？美海军陆战队的巡逻队，全副武装，没有美国兵的标记，事前并未通知解放区当局，突然进入解放区，且开枪射击，在这样情况下，八路军怎么能够不起而自卫呢？国民党当局对于其统治区内各大城市美军杀害同胞的血案，一向不当作一回事。在安平事件发生后，国民党当局对于死伤美军慰问哀悼，无微不至，甚至使美人方面也觉得有些奇怪。但是对于为了保卫国家主权而死伤的军民则不仅不加抚恤，而且咒骂为“匪”。安平事件后，国民党当局为美方辩解，甚至比美军自己还要起劲。这些中国人比美国人还要美国化，正如有些美国人比中国人还要中国化一样。国民党政府这种立场，分外助长了美方蔑视中国主权，不以平等对待中国人的不正常心理。
    国民党政府自称是“国民政府”，但是他只保护外国人，不保护中国人。纵容外国军队蹂躏祖国主权，在法律上说来这是一种“叛国罪”，同时也是一种“外患罪”。
    何教授又称：现在军调部已派特别小组调查安平事件，我们希望能判明事实真相，得到公平合理的解决。但是，不幸得很，在调查过程中，国民党方面仍坚持扩大事态的方针，美方也未因自己是这一事件的当事人而谨慎地免除自己的偏见，因而使调查发生困难。中共方面所提的调查程序，按诸法理人情，可称公允，但卒被拒绝。同时，正在三方商谈之际，美军和国民党军进占了出事地点，在法律上说，等于毁灭证据。尤其有趣的，美方一方面否认与国民党军联合进攻解放区，但另方面却派兵占领属于解放区之安平镇。这证明美方在这事件中完全丧失了中立地位，而与国民党军一起进入了作战状态。
    何教授最后称：只要美方放弃以殖民地对待中国的不正常心理，而把中国人民看作和美国人民一样有民族自尊心的人民；只要国民党当局拿出最低限度的民族立场；安平事件应当得到适当合理的解决。
    【新华社延安十二日电】北平讯：军调执行部国民党方面参谋长蔡文治关于安平事件的谈话，除毫无民族立场把中国以越南自比外，对于该事件本身经过也极尽荒谬之捏构，这点仅从天津民国日报所载之材料中即可证明。关于冲突发生地点问题，蔡谓安平镇附近并非解放区而系“共军潜入”公路区，“袭击美军”。但民国日报八月一日所载是“出事地点为共军晋冀纵队司令杨梅生辖区”。而事实上通州至武清之百余里公路，从日寇投降后即为八路军所解放了的。蔡又称共军潜入公路区，事先设置障碍，布置伏兵，显系预谋。但民国日报却说：“美军系乘载重汽车，先头为一吉普车，系一中国司机，距美部队之载重汽车尚远，该吉普车行至安平，有共军约三百余人疑系国军，“当即迫令该车停驶”，将该车推走，是时美国汽车业已开到，乃枪击共军，至是双方开始冲突。”可见不是“共军预谋伏击美军”，而是在扣留不明来历非法闯入解放区的吉普车时美军先行开火。更可笑的，是蔡文治企图以“美军伤亡如是之多，而国军并无伤亡”来证明“安平事件中没有国军”，但据上月三十一日民国日报刊载北平行营办事处处长石朝如称：十一战区长官部并未派兵前往，只“当地部队”协助美军而已。这就是蒋军联合美海军陆战队联合进犯八路军防地的证据。
