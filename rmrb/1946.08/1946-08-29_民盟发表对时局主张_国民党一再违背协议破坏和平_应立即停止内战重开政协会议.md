Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 26th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, the China Democratic League (CDL) hosted a press conference at a Shanghai restaurant on the afternoon of the 25th. Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun, Liang Shuming, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and about 70 reporters from various newspapers attended. A written statement of propositions on the current situation was released at the meeting, stating in brief: China is currently suffering from a civil war of unprecedented scale in history. If, after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the government had quickly implemented the five resolutions and immediately fulfilled the four promises without a series of anti-PCC actions, the country could have moved towards peaceful unification. This was the first missed opportunity. On April 24th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a tea party of the PCC Comprehensive Group in Chongqing, also urging the representatives to go to Nanjing for consultation as soon as possible. If, after returning to the capital in May, he had truly adhered to this intention and consulted on matters, then there would certainly have been no unsolvable issues. Unexpectedly, the government fundamentally abandoned the Political Consultative Conference from April, which was another missed opportunity. On June 7th, the government ordered a ceasefire of 15 days, followed by a continuation of the ceasefire for eight days. During those twenty-odd days, the Military Three-Person Committee only consulted on three issues: the Northeast ceasefire, the restoration of transportation, and troop reorganization. By June 30th, more than 90 percent of the three issues had been resolved. The important difficulty was only the issue of local systems after the withdrawal of the Communist troops from northern Jiangsu and other places. Unfortunately, the authorities refused to sign, which was another missed opportunity. Today, the government pays lip service to implementing the PCC resolutions, but we must solemnly declare: The steps to implement the PCC resolutions are to simultaneously cease fire nationwide and reopen the PCC meeting or the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting. If convening a National Assembly to formulate a constitution, etc., does not follow the constitutional draft passed by the PCC as the only draft, but uses the so-called "gathering opinions from all parties for reference," then this violates the spirit of the PCC and undermines the PCC resolutions, which is very clear. But we firmly support the PCC resolutions. During the meeting, Luo Longji supplemented the contents of the written statement, putting forward three hopes: (1) Immediately stop the civil war, (2) Implement the PCC resolutions, and (3) Uphold justice for the Kunming, Beiping, and Chengdu incidents. Subsequently, Liang Shuming reported on the investigation of the Li-Wen case in Kunming, explaining that the trip to Kunming was conducted solely by the CDL, and the investigation content will soon be published in a systematic report, and requesting that the case be sent to the special court of the Nanjing court for trial. After Zhang Dongsun and Luo Longji respectively reported on the Sun Zhongyuan incident in Beiping and the beating of CDL Chairman Zhang Lan in Chengdu, the meeting adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 26th: Mr. Li Furen, the Northwest负责人 (responsible person) of the CDL, who was not killed in an assassination attempt by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Xi'an but was rescued by the masses and came to Yan'an, sent a letter of condolence after learning that CDL Chairman Zhang Lan was beaten by special agent thugs at the memorial service for Mr. Wen and Mr. Li in Chengdu on August 18th. It stated: "At this time when the world is in turmoil and everyone is in danger, we have painfully pointed out the dangerous situation and fought for justice, but unexpectedly, the reactionaries were ordered to disguise themselves as thugs and beat our CDL leader, a state elder, seventy years old, and watched by the world. If this person can be beaten, who cannot be beaten? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our League hopes that political movements can exist legally, but the authorities are forcing a violent revolution underground. Since they are unwilling to pull back from the precipice and lay down their butcher knives, what else can I say?! I dare to hope that you will cherish yourself for the sake of the country!"

　　民盟发表对时局主张
    国民党一再违背协议破坏和平
    应立即停止内战重开政协会议
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据中央社上海二十五日电：民主同盟二十五日下午假上海酒楼招待新闻界，到张君劢、张东荪、梁漱溟、沈钧儒、罗隆基、章伯钧等及各报记者七十余人。会中发表书面的对时局主张，略称：中国今日正遭受着一个历史上空前大规模的内战，假使在政协闭幕后政府对五项决议很快执行，并把四项诺言立即兑现而没有一连串的反政协行动，国家便可走向和平统一的途径，这是第一次错过机会。四月二十四日，蒋主席在渝召集政协会综合小组茶会，还敦促各代表从速到京协商，如在五月还都后真执着此意遇事协商，则亦必无不可解决之事，不料从四月政府根本放弃了政治协商会议，这是再一次错过机会。六月七日，政府下令休战十五天，其后继续休战八天，在那二十几天，只由军事三人委员会协商东北停战，恢复交通及整军等三个问题，到了六月三十日，三个问题已有了百分之九十以上得到了结论，重要的困难点不过苏北等地中共撤兵后的地方制度问题，无奈当局竟不签字，这又是再次错过机会。到了今天，政府口口声声说要实施政协决议，不过我们要严重声明：实施政协决议的步骤，为一面全国停战，一面重开政协会议或重开政协综合小组会议，如召开国民大会制定宪法等，不遵照政协通过的宪草为唯一的草案，而用所谓“会萃各方意见提供参考”的方式，这就违背了政协精神，破坏了政协决议，这是很明白的。但我们是坚决拥护政协决议的。会中由罗隆基补充书面谈话内容，提出三点希望：（一）立即停止内战，（二）实施政协决议，（三）对昆明、北平、成都事件主持公道。继由梁漱溟报告赴昆调查李闻案经过，说明此次赴昆系代表民盟单独进行调查工作，调查内容不久将发表有系统的报告，并要求将本发案解南京法院特别法庭审判。在张东荪及罗隆基分别报告北平孙中原事件及民盟主席张澜在蓉被殴经过后散会。
    【新华社延安廿六日电】在西安被蒋介石特务暗杀未死而经群众救护来延之民盟西北负责人李敷仁氏，获悉民盟主席张澜于八月十八日在成都闻、李两氏追悼会上被特务暴徒殴打的消息后，特致函慰问。内称：“当此天下汹汹、人人自危之际，我们痛陈危局，仗义力争，不料反动分子竟受命伪装暴徒殴打，我公民盟领袖，国家元老，七旬高龄，四海瞩望。斯人可打，孰不可打？斯而可忍，孰不可忍？本盟希望政治运动合法存在，而当局立逼暴力革命地下进行。彼既不愿悬崖勒马，放下屠刀，我复何言？！敢望我公为国珍重！”
