[Report from this newspaper's Changzhi correspondent] Lin (cheng), Zan (huang), Yuan (shi), Huo (lu), Gao (yi), Jing (xing) and other counties in the First Administrative Region have suffered severe drought since the beginning of summer, with very late rains, and some areas have not yet received thorough rainfall. Most autumn crops have not been planted, and spring-sown autumn crops have mostly withered, creating a drought situation. The First Administrative Office issued another emergency instruction a few days ago, calling for "frugality to prevent drought and prepare for famine," stipulating: 1. In areas that have received rain, immediately organize the planting of late millet, vegetables, and buckwheat, and must strive to achieve "one mu of buckwheat and half a mu of vegetables per person." Cooperatives and mutual aid organizations in each county should be responsible for adjusting seeds, and seeds can be loaned to the poor. 2. In areas without rain, organize watering of seedlings, and launch the construction of small canals and wells, and the rational use of water sources and waterwheel irrigation tools, "watering a plant to keep it alive counts." 3. Launch a movement to save food and clothing, and save up for famine preparedness. Each village should specifically plan to save food for the famine, and cadres and activists among the masses should play an exemplary role. 4. Strictly prohibit the export of food grains, strengthen the militia, step up sentry duty, and arrest special agents and smuggling merchants.

Currently, the masses in various places, under the leadership of the democratic government, have actively taken action. In Lin, Zan, Gao and other places, a widespread movement to carry water and replant has been organized. In Chengdi and other villages in Lincheng, all male laborers in the mutual aid teams have been organized to carry water to irrigate the land, and elderly, weak women and children have all gone to the fields to plant. All seeds and farm tools have been adjusted. Most of the land in Xicun has been planted. After careful calculation in the Chengguan District of Gaoyi, farmers who usually engage in small businesses have suspended their trade and are all working in the fields. Under the leadership of political director Chi Mengxiao and production committee member Chi Luxiang in Tuling Village, Zanhuang, more than 190 mu have been planted by carrying water. Yuan (shi) has generally received thorough rainfall, and various villages are now rushing to plant buckwheat and radishes. The county government has issued a circular to the cooperatives in various villages to expand their funds and save grain with the goal of overcoming famine, and has called for the organization of transportation teams to carry grain from Shanxi, as well as advocating thrift and the collection of substitute foods. Under the leadership of labor hero Xu Kuizi in Chujiatan Village, Jingxing, the village has implemented a daily savings of two liang of rice per person, with an average of two fen of vegetables planted per person in the whole village, and twenty jin of wild dried vegetables collected.

    农民抢种晚秋作物         
    作到每人一亩荞麦半亩菜加紧岗哨严禁粮食走私
    【本报长治讯】一专区临（城）、赞（皇）、元（氏）、获（鹿）、高（邑）、井（陉）等县入夏亢旱，得雨甚迟，部分地区至今未获透雨。秋禾多未种上，春播之秋庄稼亦多枯萎，旱象已成。一专署特于日前再度发布紧急指示，号召“节衣缩食防旱备荒”规定：一、已获雨地区立即组织种晚谷、菜、荞麦，必须作到“每人一亩荞麦半亩菜”。各县合作社及村中互助组织应负责调剂种籽，贫苦者可贷给种籽。二、未雨地区组织浇苗，发动修小渠、打井，合理使用水源与水车等灌溉工具，“浇活一株算一株”。三、发动节衣缩食，储蓄备荒运动，各村应具体计划省下渡荒粮食，干部与群众中积极分子应起模范作用。四、严禁食粮出口，健全民兵，加紧放哨，缉捕特务及走私奸商。
    现各地群众在民主政府领导下已积极行动起来，临、赞、高等地普遍组织了担水补种运动，临城澄底等村互助组全部男劳力已组织起来，突击担水润地，老弱妇女儿童一齐下地点种。种籽与农具均作了全部调剂。西村土地大部已种上。高邑城关区经过精密的计算，平时作小商的农民均暂停买卖，一律下地，赞皇土岭村在政治主任池梦小与生产委员池禄祥领导下，已担水点种一百九十余亩。元氏已普获透雨，各村现正抢种荞麦、萝卜。县府通令各村合作社以渡荒为方针，扩大资金，储蓄粮食，并号召组织运输队到山西担粮，号召节约与采集代食品。井陉楚家滩村在劳动英雄许魁子领导下，已实行每日每人节约米二两，全村平均每口种菜二分，采集野生干菜二十斤。
