Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his first speech at the third plenary session of the Peace Conference yesterday, accusing the representatives of Australia and the Netherlands of attempting to replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference's two-thirds vote decision with a simple majority vote plan. Molotov revealed that the Australian and Dutch representatives were indeed playing tricks, attempting to achieve a group combination between voting countries. Molotov also cited articles from the Labour Party's Socialist newspaper and the People's Daily to support their argument, which stated: "A simple majority voting plan will allow the US and Britain to rule everything with twelve votes." Molotov stated that the change to the voting rules of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was not based on the interests of peace, but on the interests of the bloc.

The Program and Rules Committee held its first meeting on the morning of the 30th of last month, with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee. During the initial discussion, Evatt and Wang Shijie proposed Spaak as a candidate for Chairman of the Committee, and the British and Dutch representatives seconded the motion. Molotov then proposed Kardelj as a candidate, seconded by the Ukrainian and Polish representatives. The conference passed the establishment of one Chairman and one Vice-Chairman each. Molotov also strongly urged the Program and Rules Committee to pass the proposal put forward by Yugoslavia that all conference resolutions require a two-thirds majority vote for passage. Yugoslav representative Pijade believed that the two-thirds rule would be the minimum measure to reach an agreement. He said: "Justice and lasting peace can only be maintained by the support of the conference's unity, which can guarantee the success of the conference and create a solid foundation for lasting peace." However, the Australian and Dutch representatives raised an opposing motion, arguing that a simple majority should be sufficient. No decision was made on this dispute. Pijade also proposed that Albania should become the 22nd country to attend the conference because it had been invaded and destroyed by Italy. The Yugoslav representative also suggested passing a rule giving Albania the right to veto any monitoring of Trieste. The Program and Rules Committee also made no decision on these two points.

It is also reported that the full text of the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland was published in Paris on the evening of the 30th by the Council of Foreign Ministers.

　　巴黎和会三次大会
    莫洛托夫首次演说
    斥责澳荷企图推翻原表决方案
    【新华社延安一日电】苏外长莫洛托夫于昨日在和会的第三次大会上，首次发表演说，斥责澳、荷代表企图以半数票表决方案，代替外长会议三分之二票表决方案的决定。莫氏揭露澳、荷代表确实在玩弄诡计，企图达成投票国家间之集团结合。莫洛托夫并引工党社会党会报、人民报之论文来支持他们的论点，该报称：“过半数票表决方案，将使美英能以十二票统治一切”。莫洛托夫表示对外长会议投票规则之改变，不是从和平利益出发，而是从集团的利益出发。
    上月卅日晨程序规则委员会举行第一次会议，比外长斯巴克及南斯拉夫副总理卡德尔当选为该委员会之正副主席，最初讨论时，伊瓦特与王世杰提出斯巴克为该委员会主席候选人，英荷代表附议。莫洛托夫则提出卡德尔为候选人，乌克兰及波兰代表附议。大会上通过设立正副主席各一人，莫洛托夫又力促程序规则委员会通过南斯拉夫提出的所有大会决议，皆需要三分之二票数通过的提案，南代表皮雅德认为三分之二的规则，将成为达到协议最低限度的措施。他说：“正义与持久的和平，只有和会一致性的拥护，才能维系，也才能保证大会的成功，并为持久的和平造成强固的基础”。但澳、荷代表提出反对案，主张只需过半数就够了。此一争论未作决定，皮雅德又提议阿尔巴尼亚应成为出席和会的第二十二国，因为该国曾受意大利侵略，并遭受破坏。南代表又建议通过规则，给与该国对的里亚斯特任何监察之否决权。关于该两点，程序规则委员会亦未作出决定。
    另悉：外长会议对于意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案的全文，已于三十日晚在巴黎公布。
