Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 25th. The people of Jinan and Qingdao, unable to bear the tyrannical government of the Kuomintang authorities, have seen more than 300 people flee to the liberated areas with their families. Our democratic government and local people are helping them settle down and build their lives. Shi Dianchen and other boatmen, 132 in total, who risked their lives to escape from Jinan, sailed more than 20 boats and safely arrived at Yangjiaoshi in Shouguang County, a liberated area in the Bohai Sea region. Our local government allocated 18,000 yuan (at 20 yuan per legal tender) to repair the damaged boats for them to engage in transportation. Within a short period, they earned more than 500,000 yuan, greatly improving their lives. Shi Dianchen and others happily told the chairman of the Navigation Industry Union: "We have been running this waterway for more than 20 years, and we have never made such a big profit." More than 200 refugees who fled from Qingdao to the liberated areas have been introduced by the democratic government to settle and work in Haiyang, Laiyang and other counties. When the first batch of more than 60 refugees arrived in Haiyang County, the nearby people sent large quantities of eggs and pancakes and other food to express their cordial greetings. The refugees said with emotion: "We can't even eat so well during the New Year at home."

    我政府群众帮助安家立业
    【新华社临沂廿五日电】济南及青岛两地人民，不堪国民党当局虐政，已有三百余人携家属逃来解放区，我民主政府及当地民众均帮助其安家立业。由济南冒险逃出之船民石殿臣等一百三十二人，驾船二十余艘，于安抵渤海解放区寿光县之羊角市后，我当地经政府拨款一万八千元（每元合法币二十元）将损伤之船只修好，从事运输，短期内获利五十余万元，生活大为改善。石殿臣等高兴的向航业工会会长说：“我们二十多年来跑这条水路，从未赚过这样大的利。”由青岛逃奔解放区之难民二百余人，已由民主政府分别介绍至海阳、莱阳等县安家就业。当首批六十余难民到达海阳县时，附近群众纷纷送来大批鸡蛋及大饼等食物亲切慰问，难民们感动地说：“俺在家过年也吃不上这样好。”
