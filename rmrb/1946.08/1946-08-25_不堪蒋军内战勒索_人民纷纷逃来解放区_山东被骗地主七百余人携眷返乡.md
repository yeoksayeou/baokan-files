　　Unable to Endure Chiang Kai-shek's Army's Wartime Extortion
　　People Flee to Liberated Areas
　　More Than 700 Deceived Landlords from Shandong Bring Families Back Home
    [Yangcheng, 21st dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek's army launched a large-scale civil war, and the requisition of military grain was extremely urgent, causing people to be impoverished and bankrupt, with large numbers fleeing to the liberated areas. According to refugees who fled from Shan County: Shan County purchased military grain twice from the end of November last year to the end of April this year. In the first phase, the price of wheat was set at 45 yuan per jin, and in the second phase, it was issued at 26 yuan, 1 jiao, 8 fen, and 5 li. If calculated at the market price at the time, the people had to compensate more than 100 yuan per jin of wheat on average. Based on the county's population, each person had to bear a compensation fee of about 30,000 yuan for just one purchase of military grain. At the same time, the actual wheat price issued was mostly embezzled by Kuomintang bureaucrats and baojia heads, and the people's losses amounted to more than 2 billion yuan. From November last year to the end of May this year, Xiuwu built 576 bunkers, costing a total of 2.23714 billion yuan, plus the funds allocated by the security teams of various counties, totaling 267.73 million yuan. Based on the 50,000 people in the stubborn occupied area of Xiuwu, each person had to bear 50,000 yuan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th dispatch] Landlords who were temporarily misled by Kuomintang secret agents' rumors and fled to Jinan, Cang County, Yanzhou, Xuzhou, Haizhou and other places, nearly 700 people have recently returned to their hometowns with their families. Liu Hengren, a landlord who returned to Linyi, cried to his fellow villagers, saying: "Before, I was blinded by greed and lightly believed the reactionary rumors and fled to Jinan. All the cash I carried was robbed by the merciless Central Army on the way. When I arrived in Yanzhou, I was falsely accused of being a 'traitor' and subjected to chili water torture and imprisoned for more than 20 days. I can't finish telling the suffering I have endured in two days." Ye Zhenshu, a landlord who fled from Cang County, and his family said: "We were extorted so badly by the running dogs. In Cangzhou, we had nothing to eat or drink and had to keep making donations. The carts and donkeys we brought were all forced to be sold." Liu Xianzhu, a landlord who had participated in the assassination squad in Cang County, decided to repent and start anew after returning home, and handed over his pistol to the democratic government. At present, the democratic governments in various places have returned the land held in trust to the landlords and are coordinating to help those who are temporarily in financial difficulties settle down.

　　不堪蒋军内战勒索
　　人民纷纷逃来解放区
　　山东被骗地主七百余人携眷返乡
    【阳城二十一日电】蒋军发动大规模内战，军粮催似火急，人民倾家破产，大批向解放区逃亡。据陕县逃来之难民谈：陕县从去年十一月底到今年四月底止，前后代购军粮两次，第一期每斤麦子规定价格四十五元，第二期按二十六元一角八分五发给，如以当时市价计算，平均每斤麦子人民得赔偿百元以上，按全县人口分摊，仅代购军粮一次，每人即须负担赔偿费三万元左右。同时实际所发麦价，又多为国民党官僚保甲长贪污中饱，人民的损失，达二十亿元以上。修武自去年十一月到今年五月底止，构筑碉堡五百七十六座，共花洋二十二亿三千七百一十四万元，加上各县保安团队派款共为二十六万万七千七百三十万元。按修武顽占区五万人计算，每人负担即达五万元。
    【新华社临沂十三日电】一时误信国民党特务造谣而逃往济南、沧县、兖州、徐州、海州等地之地主，近已有七百余人陆续携眷返乡。回至临沂的地主刘恒人向其乡亲哭诉称：“以前我是油蒙住心，轻信反动派谣言逃往济南，所携现款均在中途遭狼心狗肺的中央军劫去。在到兖州时，且被诬为‘奸民’灌辣椒水，囚禁二十余日。回想所受的罪两天也说不完。”由沧县逃来之地主叶贞书及其眷属说：“可叫狗腿子敲诈苦了，在沧州无吃无喝还要不断拿捐，带去的大车和驴骡都被迫卖光了。”曾参加沧县暗杀团之地主刘宪洲，返家后决心悔过自新，并把驳壳枪送交民主政府。现各地民主政府均分别将代管土地交还地主，并协同帮助暂时生活困难者安家。
