　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] A batch of relief supplies from the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), intended for northern Henan, arrived at the Handan Border Region Relief Association on August 7th. Upon inspection, it was discovered that some items were lost in transit. Originally, 180 packages of clothing were sent; after deducting 30 packages transported to the Hua County area (four counties), 150 packages were sent to the Handan Branch. These 150 packages were originally 15,386 pounds, but only 14,502 pounds remained upon inspection. Additionally, four packages were water damaged and expanded by 32 pounds, so the actual received weight was 14,534.5 pounds.

　　Originally, 375 cases of milk were sent (48 cans per case, each can weighing 14.5 ounces). 63 cases were transported to the Hua County area. The number transported to the Handan Branch should have been 312 cases. However, only 294 cases and 11 cans were in good condition, 13 cases and 11 cans had rusty containers, 3 cases and 30 cans were spoiled, 37 cans were empty, and 7 cans were missing.

　　The original shipment of medicine consisted of 12 cases of quinine (1,000 tablets per bottle), 36 bottles of Atabrine (100 tablets per bottle), 12 bottles of gentian pills (100 pills per bottle), 240 rolls of adhesive plaster, 60 packages of absorbent cotton, 12 dozen three-inch gauze bandages, 12 dozen four-inch gauze bandages, 12 rolls of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, 60 small bars of soap, and 60 large bars of soap. However, the actual received quantities were 8 bottles of quinine, 33 bottles of Atabrine, 11 bottles of gentian pills, 237 rolls of adhesive plaster, 10 rolls of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, 50 small bars of soap, and 52 large bars of soap. According to the person in charge of the branch, regardless of the reasons for the above shortages, the people of northern Henan should have received these supplies but did not. Therefore, it is hoped that the branch can replenish the missing supplies to the original amount.

　　After completing the inventory on the 9th, the branch immediately allocated the actual received quantities reasonably. Specifically, 30 packages of clothing, 63 cases of milk, and 3 cases of medicine to the Hua County area; 12 packages of clothing, 2 bottles of Atabrine, 18 rolls of adhesive plaster, 1 package of absorbent cotton, 1 dozen three-inch gauze bandages, 1 dozen four-inch gauze bandages, 1 roll of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, and 5 small bars of soap to Linzhang in southern Hebei; 24 packages of clothing, 50 cases of milk, and 2 cases of medicine (originally 12 portions, one portion per case) to Jiyuan and Meng Counties in the Taiyue Region. A total of 114 packages of clothing, 180 cases of milk, and 77 cases and 22 cans (including 13 cases and 11 cans with rusty containers, currently being inspected by doctors) to the fourteen counties of the Taihang Third and Fourth Special Districts. The remaining medicine, after distribution to the Hua County Special District and Linzhang, Jiyuan, and Meng counties, was entirely allocated to Taihang. However, due to rainstorms and damaged roads, the supplies cannot be transported to various places on time, and efforts are being made to transport and distribute them to the disaster victims.

　　Furthermore, of the 25 counties in northern Henan, the counties more completely occupied by Chiang's troops are Xinxiang, Yuanwu, Fengqiu, and Yangwu. The complete counties within our liberated areas are Boai, Wenxian, Qinyang, Wu'an, Shexian, Linxian, Mengxian, Jiyuan, Huaxian, Junxian, Linzhang, and Neihuang, a total of twelve counties. Nine counties are partially occupied. The ratio is that the liberated areas occupy 70% of Anyang, 60% of Tangyin, 40% of Qixian, 50% of Jixian, 70% of Xiuwu, 30% of Huojia, 50% of Huixian, 50% of Wuzhi, and 60% of Yanjin. When the Henan Branch conducted emergency relief in early April, the principle of distributing supplies was that the county's share of relief supplies would be given to the side that controlled the county seat. As a result, only the twelve complete counties in the liberated areas received supplies, while the nine counties that were partially occupied were entirely given to Chiang's forces. The people of these nine counties in northern Henan are deeply dissatisfied. Our representative, entrusted by the disaster victims, went to the Henan Branch in Kaifeng to negotiate. After extensive discussions, the Henan Branch believed that the opinions expressed by our representative were completely reasonable, but the emergency relief period had passed and the amount of flour in storage was very small. Therefore, it was decided to provide the disaster victims in the liberated areas of northern Henan with 180 packages of used clothing, 18,000 cans of milk, and 12 cases of medicine as a supplementary distribution. Our representative, Comrade Gao Buqing, together with Mr. Liu Shumo and Mr. Qin Hansheng, representatives of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, transported these supplies to Handan for redistribution to Wu'an.

　　行总救济物资一部运邯
    点收数目短少希按原数补足
    豫北九县人民愤慨蒋方独吞救资
    【本报特讯】行总河南分署救济豫北之物资一批，于八月七日运达邯郸边区救济分会进行点收时，发现路上损失一部，计原发来衣服一百八十包，除运滑县区四县三十包外，运邯郸分会之一百五十包，原为一万五千三百八十六磅，点收时仅余一万四千五百零二磅。另有四包因水湿涨出三十二磅，实收数为一万四千五百三十四磅半。
    原发牛奶三百七十五箱（每箱四十八厅，每厅重十四盎斯半），运滑县区六十三箱，运邯郸分会者应为三百一十二箱，但内中好的为二百九十四箱十一厅，锈了桶子的十三箱十一厅，坏了的三箱三十厅，空的三十七厅，短少七厅。
    药品十二箱原为奎宁十二瓶（每瓶千片），洋鼠理片三十六瓶（每瓶百片），龙胆丸十二瓶（每瓶百粒），胶皮二百四十卷，药棉六十包，三寸纱布十二打，四寸纱布十二打，三十六寸纱布十二卷，小块药皂六十块，大块药皂六十块，但实收到奎宁八瓶，洋鼠理片三十三瓶，龙胆丸十一瓶，胶布二百三十七卷，三十六寸纱布十卷，小块药皂五十块，大块药皂五十二块。据分会负责人表示：以上短少之物资不管其原因为何，但豫北人民是应该得到而没有得到，故希望分署能将短少之物资按原数补足。
    分会于九日点收完毕后，立即按实收数合理分配，计滑县区衣服三十包、牛奶六十三箱、药品三箱、冀南之临漳衣服十二包、洋鼠理片两瓶、胶布十八卷、药棉一包、三寸纱布一打、四寸纱布一打、三十六寸纱布一卷、小块药皂五块、太岳区济源、孟县两县衣服二十四包、牛奶五十箱、药品两箱（原数为十二份每箱一份）。太行三四专区十四个县共衣服一百一十四包，牛奶一百八十箱，福利托儿所七十七箱二十二厅（内有锈桶十三箱十一厅、正由医生检查中），药品除分给滑县专署区及临漳、济源、孟县者外，余全数给与太行。但天雨成灾，道路冲坏，不能按时运往各地，现正积极设法运输发给灾民。
    又讯：豫北共二十五个县，蒋军占领之较完整县为新乡、原武、封邱、阳武四县。我解放区内完整县为博爱、温县、沁阳、武安、涉县、林县、孟县、济源、滑县、浚县、临漳、内黄等十二个县，各占一部者为九个县，其比例计解放区占安阳百分之七十、汤阴百分之六十、淇县百分之四十、汲县百分之五十、修武百分之七十、获嘉百分之三十、辉县百分之五十、武陟百分之五十、延津百分之六十，当四月初河南分署进行急赈时之物资分配原则，为县城在那方面即将该县应得之救济物资交与那方面，因之解放区只十二个完整县得到物资，各占一部之九个县完全发给了蒋方，豫北九县人民深为不满。我方代表承灾民之托，前往开封河南分署进行交涉，经过多余商谈，河南分署方面认为我方代表所述意见完全合理，但急赈时期已过，面粉存数甚少，遂决定给豫北解放区灾民旧衣一百八十包，牛奶一万八千厅、药品十二箱，以示补发。我方代表高步青同志协同行总河南分署代表刘树模、秦汉生两氏，当将此物资运至邯郸，转武安分发云。
