　　Ten Minutes of Battle　　　　　　　Taiyue Communications
    On the night of the 13th, after our army recovered Dangma Village, two platoons of the Fifth Company chased the KMT troops of the First Company all the way to Zhu Village. The stubborn enemy set up a machine gun on the east gate tower of Zhu Village, firing wildly at the two platoons. However, our Deputy Company Commander Huang Jianli, braving the rain of bullets, charged heroically and drove the enemy into the village with four grenades in a row. We didn't stop and attacked straight into the village, occupying four courtyards. The stubborn enemy inside the village panicked and hastily started up mountain guns, infantry guns, mortars, and machine guns mounted on trees. Immediately, all kinds of sounds rang out, and sparks flew inside and outside the village. The other soldiers who had just recovered Changma, upon hearing their roar, also rushed to Zhu Village as fast as they could. Before long, they also plunged in from around the village. Grenades bloomed everywhere in the village, and the entire enemy force was thrown into chaos. Except for the stubborn enemy commander north of the crossroads, who desperately clung to a portion of his forces to resist, most of the enemy lost their courage in the terrifying darkness. Our soldiers charged and fought like dragons and tigers. Wang Zhangde, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad of the Seventh Company, led seven soldiers into the village from the south side and happened to meet the Second Squad, which had been challenged to compete with them, collecting the guns of the stubborn enemy in the temple courtyard, making them both envious and anxious. Suddenly, they heard Deputy Platoon Leader Li Jingfu shouting softly to them, and everyone immediately followed Li Jingfu north. Nine black shadows went up and down on the wall, and in a flash, they crossed two empty courtyards and hid in the shadow of the wall. Li Jingde saw several stubborn enemy soldiers through the gunhole in the north wall, squeezing into a dark room to the west like startled rats. He turned back and beckoned to Wang Zhangde, then immediately jumped onto the wall and landed gently in the courtyard. Wang Zhangde followed suit, and the other seven people had already surrounded the courtyard. Wang Zhangde groped to the window and looked inside. In the darkness, more than twenty stubborn enemy soldiers were huddled together in fear. He quickly retreated two steps, reached out, and threw a grenade into the door. Li Jingfu also threw one in. As the grenades exploded, the people in the room shouted in unison, "We surrender! We surrender!" Immediately afterward, a mortar tube was thrown out of the door. Wang Zhangde was still not at ease. He rushed in with a stride, and in the darkness, twenty-four stubborn enemy soldiers suddenly saw the flash of a bayonet approaching, and they knelt down in panic, clapping their hands and shouting, "We don't have any guns! We don't have any guns!" Li Jingfu continued to scout forward. At the corner of a dead alley, two heads wearing American-style caps poked out, peeking around. Li Jingfu thought that these must be guys looking for an opportunity to escape, and he quickly ordered two soldiers to block the alley entrance. He and Wang Zhangde rushed in in one breath. When the two guys poked their heads out again, they happened to be hit by a grenade explosion. The corner immediately cried out, "Ah! Don't shoot! We surrender..." They went up to take a look, and there were more than ninety people in total, some unarmed and some holding guns. Li Jingfu shouted loudly, and the stubborn enemy soldiers all put down their guns one by one. After saying a few comforting words to calm them down, they were taken to the rear in teams. Immediately afterward, Wang Zhangde discovered a large courtyard full of mules and horses, with two heavy machine guns and more than thirty rifles scattered on the ground, as well as several boxes of shells. He ordered two soldiers to guard them, and then hurriedly followed the deputy platoon leader and two soldiers to break through to the north. In a courtyard in front, there were chaotic noises and gunshots from the enemy. Because the courtyard wall was high and difficult to climb, Wang Zhangde threw a grenade over the wall, and the courtyard immediately became silent. At this time, Li Jingfu had nimbly sneaked to the courtyard gate and looked inside. Three wounded stubborn enemy soldiers were lying in the courtyard, groaning softly. He looked around the courtyard and knew that the enemy had nowhere to run. He quickly threw a grenade into the south room and shouted, "Those who surrender will not be killed; we are all Chinese." Then he heard a "thud!" A mortar was thrown out of the door, followed by "Zhongzheng rifles" like locusts thrown out of the door and window black holes, landing in the moonlight. When the stubborn enemy soldiers came out of the house, afraid that our soldiers would shoot, they clapped their hands high and kept shouting, "Out, out!" Only when they saw our soldiers greeting them did they feel relieved. Truly "trained Nationalist soldiers"! This is how Chiang Kai-shek's American weapons were let go by his soldiers. In the ten-minute battle between the Sixth Squad and the enemy in Li Village, the results were: more than 170 stubborn enemy soldiers captured, 64 mules and horses, two mortars, two heavy machine guns, and more than 120 rifles... We had no casualties.

　　十分钟的战斗            太岳通讯
    十三号夜里我军收复当马村后，五连两个排把一连蒋军一直追赶到朱村，顽军在朱村东门楼上架了一挺机枪，迎着这两个排狂叫起来，但是我们的副连长黄建利，冒着弹雨，英勇地冲了上去，一连四个手榴弹，就把顽军赶到村里。我们没停脚，一直攻进村里，占了四座院子，村内的顽军恐慌了，急急开动了山炮、步兵炮、迫击炮和架在树上的机关枪，立时各种声音响成一片，村里村外火花飞溅，其他刚收复常马的战士们，一听到他们的吼叫，也快步如飞的增援到朱村来，不一会就从村周围也扑了进去，手榴弹在村里到处开花，全村顽军慌乱的混成一团，除了十字路北的顽军指挥官，还死力抓住一部分兵力挣扎抵抗外，大部顽军在这恐怖的黑夜里丧魂失魄了。我们的战士们生龙活虎的冲杀着。七连的六班长王章德，领着七个战士，从村南面冲进去时，正遇见与自己挑战的第二班，在收缴庙院顽军的枪，使得他们又羡慕又着急，猛然间我们听见副排长李景福向他们小声喊叫，大家就立刻跟着李景福向北奔去，九个黑影子在墙头上忽上忽下，霎时翻过两座空院隐蔽在墙荫下。李景德从北墙的枪眼里望见几个顽军，像受惊的老鼠，挤着往西边黑屋里钻，他回头向王章德一招手，立即纵身跳上墙头，轻轻落到院里，王章德照样跟上来，其他七个人已经把院子包围起来了。王章德摸到窗前往里瞧，黑暗中二十多个顽军吓得缩成了一团，他火速退了两步，伸手将一个手榴弹仍进门里，李景福也跟着扔进去一颗，随着手榴弹爆炸，屋里同声喊出“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！”紧接着一门迫击炮筒就从门里扔出来，王章德还不放心，一个箭步冲进去，黑暗里二十四个顽军猛见一道刺刀的闪光逼来，慌忙跪倒，不住地拍着手喊：“我们没有枪了！我们没有枪了！”李景福继续往前侦察，在一个死胡同里的拐角处，两个戴美式大盖帽的脑袋伸出来在窥探，李景福的心想这准是些想找空隙逃跑的家伙，忙叫两个战士堵住胡同口，他和王章德一口气冲了进去，等那两个家伙又伸出来时，刚好碰上手榴弹开花，拐角里马上哭叫起来“啊呀！不敢打呀！我们缴枪呀……”，他们走上去一看，徒手的持枪的共有九十多个，李景福大喊了一声，顽军们一个个都把枪放下来。说了两句宽心的话，定定他们的神，就成队的带到后面去了。紧接着王章德又发现一座大院子骡马拴得满满的，两挺重机枪和三十多枝步枪乱放在地上，还有几个炮弹箱，他叫两个战士看守着，又急忙跟着副排长和两个战士往北突去。在前面一所大院里，有敌人慌乱的喧闹声和枪声，因院墙较高不易攀登，王章德隔墙投进一个手榴弹，院内立时鸦雀无声了。这时李景福已敏捷的伏到院门口往内看，三个带伤的顽军，正躺在院里小声呻吟，他环视一下院子的情形，知道敌人没处跑，赶快向南房扔进一颗炸弹，高喊“缴枪不打，都是中国人。”接着听得“呼咚！”一声，一门迫击炮从门里抛出来，紧连着“中正步枪”像飞蝗一样从门窗黑洞里掷出来，落在月亮地里。顽军从屋里走出来时，怕我们战士开枪，高高拍着手，嘴里不住喊着：“出来了，出来了！”及至见到我们战士招呼他们才放了心。真是“有训练的国军”！蒋介石的美式武器就是这样叫他们士兵们放下了。六班在李村与敌人战斗中十分钟的战果，俘虏顽军一百七十余名，骡马六十四匹、两门迫击炮、两挺重机枪，步枪一百二十余枝………我们没有伤亡一个人。
