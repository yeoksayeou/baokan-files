The traitorous and country-selling ringleader, in order to sell out the motherland and destroy the democratic liberated areas, has mobilized Chiang's troops, equipped by the United States, to encircle and annihilate our Central Plains Military Region, attack our Subei, Shandong, and southern Shanxi liberated areas, and bomb our CPC Central Committee's location in Yan'an, and the Yan'an headquarters. Relying on the support of their master, the American imperialist elements, they have formally declared war on the democratic forces of all the Chinese people. The flames of civil war are rapidly spreading.

Comrades! Compatriots! Our Chinese nation is facing a grave crisis. On the one hand, the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek is attempting to steal the fruits of the War of Resistance by utilizing the remnants of Japanese fascism, maintain his dictatorial rule, and strangle all the basic rights of the Chinese people. On the other hand, American imperialist elements are preparing to enslave the Chinese people through traitorous ringleaders. They have effectively taken control of our country's military, political, and economic lifeline, seizing our motherland's territory, airspace, territorial waters, and inland navigation rights. American goods are flooding everywhere, destroying national industries. The motherland is increasingly moving towards the path of becoming an American dependency. The eight years of bloody War of Resistance to drive out Japanese imperialism aimed to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. However, contrary to expectations, Chiang Kai-shek is preparing to replace Wang Jingwei, while American imperialist elements are preparing to replace the position of Japanese imperialism. The US-Chiang collaboration is to usurp the fruits of our eight-year War of Resistance. After eight years of heroic resistance and bloody sacrifice, we have not obtained independence, peace, and democracy. The fruits obtained through heroic resistance and bloody sacrifice have been stolen and sold out by traitorous and dictatorial elements. Now, only a just patriotic war can smash the mad offensive of traitorous and dictatorial elements, defend national independence and the integrity of national sovereignty and territory, and defend the liberated areas to realize independence, peace, and democracy. Without the victory of the patriotic war, there will be no peace, no democracy, no independence and freedom. The traitorous ringleaders can more easily sell out. Our sacred patriotic self-defense war is a war for independence, peace, and democracy!

Now, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army has invaded and continues to approach our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. Hu Zongnan's four armies are gathering in Yuncheng and Wenxi, actively advancing north. The 10th, 41st, and 47th Armies, which are besieging the Central Plains, are ordered to advance towards northern and eastern Henan. The disaster is deep! The time is pressing! All the soldiers and civilians in our border region should urgently mobilize and join hands with patriotic and democratic people in all liberated areas and Chiang-occupied areas to fight together for the realization of independence, peace, and democracy.

In order to win this war, we call on all soldiers and civilians in the entire border region, regardless of gender, age, or background, to mobilize and fight to implement the following tasks:

	(1) Soldiers of the Border Region, all commanders, fighters, political workers, artillerymen, cavalrymen, engineers, comrades and combat heroes, you should continue the glorious tradition of the eight-year War of Resistance and the Shangdang-Pinghan self-defense operations, carry forward the new heroism, fight bravely and resolutely annihilate the enemy, seize Chiang's army weapons to arm yourselves, and be willing to sacrifice everything to defend the motherland and hometown. This is your supreme glory; you should carry forward the flexible and mobile combat style, strengthen the combination of technology and tactics, and the coordinated actions between various arms and services; you must remember Chairman Mao's military guiding ideology in any case, to fight annihilation battles, to fight prepared battles; you should seize all combat intervals to conduct training, improve the three major techniques, improve the tactical literacy of commanders, and absorb new combat experience; you should strengthen unity, be harmonious internally, be ruthless towards the enemy, abide by discipline, obey orders, and especially carry forward the spirit of serving the people and being closely united with the masses, sharing life and death and difficulties. Victory is definitely ours.

	(2) Widely develop mass guerrilla warfare. All local armed forces, armed work teams, guerrillas, and millions of militiamen in the entire region, you should carry forward the tradition of the eight-year anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, go to the front line, go to the rear of the invaders, cooperate with the main force in combat, persist in the struggle in areas temporarily occupied by Chiang's army, strengthen activities in the border areas, destroy the invaders' railways and highways, intercept their supplies, cut off their supply lines, attack their transportation units, implement a scorched earth policy, launch landmine warfare, and use all effective methods to kill and injure the enemy. In the rear of Chiang's army, protect our democratic regime, maintain the interests of the masses, and establish new armed forces, so that Chiang's army is attacked from both the front and the rear, in order to cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy and retake all lost territories.

	(3) Strengthen the rear work and fully support the front line, everything for the victory of the front line. We call on all young and middle-aged people in the region to enthusiastically join the soldiers of the Border Region and ensure that the main force is constantly fully staffed. We require all military factories, logistics personnel, doctors, and nurses to work hard, intensify their work, and improve work efficiency and technical level. We call on militiamen, self-defense team members, and war participants to enthusiastically participate in stretcher rescue and transportation and other war service work, and do this work well, and strive to transport materials to ensure the supply of troops, so that they can get adequate food, clothing and material supplements.

	(4) Strengthen the political offensive, launch the righteous movement of Gao Shuxun and Kong Congzhou against civil war, against treason, and to participate in the people's cause, expand the patriotic united front, and call on all patriotic Kuomintang officers and soldiers who do not want civil war to carry out anti-civil war and anti-treason uprisings and stand on the side of the people. We warmly welcome them, respect their officer-soldier organizational life methods and traditional habits, and help them become the people's army. We are willing to cooperate with all patriotic people who advocate democracy and are for peace in China, regardless of class, gender, race, worker, peasant, soldier, student, or merchant, a grand alliance, to strive for independence, peace, and democracy.

	(5) Realize "land to the tillers," open up the path for the development of capitalist industry and agriculture, continue to mobilize the masses, and implement the mass emancipation movement. We must thoroughly carry out the anti-traitor liquidation, confiscate the land of the great traitors and distribute it to the landless and land-poor peasants, so that the working peasants have land to cultivate and food to eat; we must take care of the lives of landlords and rich peasants, so that they also have land to cultivate and food to eat; we must further develop industrial production and develop capitalism in the liberated areas. In villages and areas that have already realized "land to the tillers," we must organize farmers to produce well and prepare for next year's spring production campaign. This is an important guarantee for us to win the self-defense war and the patriotic war. No matter what the circumstances, we must insist on its realization and not relax in the slightest because of the urgency of the war.

	(6) Strive for production and frugality, everything from a long-term perspective, overcome the phenomenon of waste of manpower and material resources, especially in war service mobilization, scientific calculation is required, organize manpower and material resources, and avoid waste; we must be thrifty and honest, oppose corruption and waste; we must strengthen the development of agriculture, household sideline, factories, handicrafts, transportation, cooperative businesses, and mining industries, and carry forward the model of combining production and combat during the War of Resistance, and try to mobilize women and other semi-laborers to participate in production, and carry out a large-scale production campaign. And take all effective measures to stabilize prices, in order to improve people's lives, increase people's wealth, support long-term warfare, and ensure military and civilian food.

Comrades! Compatriots! We have full confidence in victory. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries have their serious difficulties: financial difficulties, officers and soldiers are tired of war and anti-war, morale is low, continuous anti-civil war and anti-traitor uprisings are taking place, disasters are extremely serious, people are living in poverty, people's grievances are boiling, people's rebellions are rising, the national democratic movement is surging, and the people of the whole country oppose the traitorous and unjust war carried out by the traitorous ringleaders; we have sufficient conditions for victory, all soldiers and civilians have the experience of persisting in the eight-year anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines, and the experience of the victory of the first self-defense war. We are a just patriotic self-defense war, with the sympathy and support of the anti-fascist people of the whole country. The broad masses of people have already turned themselves over, and have the brotherly cooperation of the liberated areas. As long as we are closely united around the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly complete the above tasks, we will surely win, victory is ours! Let us shout:

Crush the offensive of the traitorous ringleaders!
The soldiers and civilians of the entire border region are mobilized to strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war!
Fight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy!
Resolutely follow the Communist Party of China forward, follow Chairman Mao forward!

　　为粉碎蒋介石进攻晋冀鲁豫解放区暨争取爱国战争胜利的号召
    汉奸卖国贼头子为出卖祖国摧毁民主的解放区，调集美国所装备起来的蒋军围歼我中原军区，进攻我苏北山东及晋南解放区，轰炸我中共中央所在地延安，及延安总部。它们凭借其主子美帝国主义分子的扶持，已向全中国人民民主力量正式宣战，内战烽火正在迅速的蔓延中。
    同志们！同胞们！我中华民族正面临着严重危机，一方面是卖国独夫蒋介石利用日本法西斯残余企图窃取抗战果实，维持其独裁统治，必欲绞杀中国人民的一切基本权利；一方面是美帝国主义分子准备通过汉奸卖国贼头子来奴役中国人民，它实际上已掌握了我国的军事政治经济命脉，攫取了我祖国的领土领空领海及内河航行权，美货到处泛滥，摧毁民族工业，祖国濒危日益走上美国附庸国的道路。八年流血抗战，赶走日本帝国主义，其目的在求中国之独立自由平等，但事与愿违，蒋介石准备代替汪精卫，美帝国主义分子则准备代替日本帝国主义的地位，美蒋合作以篡窃我八年抗战的果实，我们在八年抗战之后没有得到独立和平与民主，英勇抗战流血牺牲所换来的果实，为汉奸卖国贼独裁主义者所窃取所出卖，现在只有以正义的爱国战争来粉碎汉奸卖国贼独裁主义者的疯狂进攻，保卫民族独立与国家主权领土的完整，保卫解放区以实现独立和平与民主，如果没有爱国战争的胜利，就没有和平可言，就没有民主可言，就不会有独立和自由，汉奸卖国贼头子就更可顺利的出卖，我们进行神圣的爱国自卫战争，就是为独立和平与民主而战！
    现在蒋介石反动大军已侵入并继续逼近我晋冀鲁豫边区，胡宗南指挥的四个军正集结运城闻喜积极北进，围攻中原的第十军、四十一军、四十七军正奉令向我豫北豫东挺进，祸深矣！时迫矣！我全边区军民应紧急动员，同各解放区及蒋占区的爱国民主人士们携起手来，共同为实现独立和平与民主而战。
    为了争取这一战争的胜利，我们号召全边区军民不分男女老幼一致动员起来，为实行下列的任务而斗争。
    （一）全边区的子弟兵、全体指战员、政工人员、炮兵、骑兵、工兵同志们和战斗英雄们，你们应继续八年抗战和上党平汉自卫作战的光荣传统，发扬新英雄主义，勇敢作战坚决歼灭敌人，夺取蒋军武装来武装自己，为保卫祖国与家乡不惜牺牲一切，这是你们无上光荣；你们应发扬机动灵活的战斗作风，加强技术与战术的结合，各兵种各部队间的协同动作；你们在任何情况下都要记取毛主席的军事指导思想，要打歼灭仗，要打有准备的仗；你们应抓紧一切战斗间隙进行练兵提高三大技术，提高指挥员的战术素养，吸收新的战斗经验；你们应加强团结，对内要和，对敌要狠，遵守纪律，服从命令，特别要发扬为人民服务的精神和群众亲密一致，同生死共患难，胜利一定是我们的。
    （二）广泛开展群众游击战争，一切地方武装、武工队、游击队及全区百万民兵们，你们应发扬八年抗日游击战争的传统，到前线去，到进攻者的后方去，协同主力作战，坚持暂时被蒋军侵占地区的斗争，强化边沿区活动，破坏进攻者的铁路公路，击截它的辎重，切断它的补给线，打击它的运输部队，实行空室清野，发动地雷战，用一切有效方法杀伤敌人，在蒋军的后方则保护我民主政权维持群众利益，建立新的武装，使蒋军腹背受击，以便配合主力军歼灭敌人，夺回一切失地。
    （三）加强后方工作，全力支援前线，一切为着前线的胜利。我们号召全区一切青壮年要踊跃参加子弟兵，保证主力军不断满员。我们要求一切军需工厂后勤人员医生护士们努力生产加紧工作，提高工作效能与技术水平。我们号召民兵自卫队员及参战群众们，踊跃参加担架救护和运输等战勤工作，并把这一工作搞好，要努力输将，保证部队的供给，使他们得到充分的衣食和物质补充。
    （四）加强政治攻势，开展高树勋，孔从周反对内战，反对卖国，参加人民事业的正义运动，扩大爱国主义统一战线，号召一切不愿内战的爱国的国民党官兵实行反内战反卖国起义，站到人民方面来，我们热烈的欢迎他们，尊重他们的官长士兵组织生活方法和传统习惯，帮助他们成为人民的军队。我们愿与一切爱国的、主张民主的、为了中国和平的人士合作，不分阶级性别种族工农兵学商大联合，为争取独立和平与民主而奋斗。
    （五）实现耕者有其田，开辟资本主义工农业发展的途径继续动员群众，贯彻群众翻身运动，要彻底进行反奸清算，没收大汉奸的土地分给无地少地的农民，使劳动农民有地种有饭吃；要照顾地主富农的生活，使其同样有地种有饭吃；要更加发展工业生产，发展解放区的资本主义，在已经实现了耕者有其田的村庄和地区，要很好的组织农民生产及准备明年春季大生产运动。这是我们争取自卫战争爱国战争胜利的重要保证，不管在任何情况下要坚持其实现，不能因战争紧迫而丝毫放松。
    （六）努力生产节约，一切从长期打算，克服人力物力的浪费现象，在战勤动员中尤需科学计算，组织人力物力，避免浪费；必须节衣缩食廉洁奉公，反对贪污浪费；必须加强农业、家庭副业、工厂手工业、运输事业、合作事业及采矿业的发展，发扬抗战期间生产与战斗相结合的模范，尽量发动妇女等半劳动力参加生产，开展大生产运动。并以一切有效之措施稳定物价，借以改善人民生活，增加人民财富，支持长期战争，保证军需民食。
    同志们！同胞们！我们有充分胜利信心，蒋介石反动派有其严重的困难，财政困难、官兵厌战反战，士气低落，不断举行反内战反卖国起义，灾荒极端严重，民不聊生、民怨沸腾、民变蜂起，全国民主运动高涨，全国人民反对汉奸卖国贼头子所进行的卖国的非正义的战争；我们则有足够的胜利条件，全体军民都有坚持敌后八年抗战的经验，有第一次自卫战争胜利的经验，我们是正义的爱国自卫战争，有全国反法西斯人民的同情和拥护，广大人民已经翻了身，有各解放区弟兄般的配合，只要我们紧紧的团结在中共中央及毛主席的周围，彻底完成上述任务，我们一定会胜利的，胜利是我们的！让我们高呼：
    粉碎汉奸卖国贼的进攻！
    全边区军民动员起来，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利！
    为独立和平民主奋斗到底！
    坚决跟着中国共产党前进，跟着毛主席前进！
