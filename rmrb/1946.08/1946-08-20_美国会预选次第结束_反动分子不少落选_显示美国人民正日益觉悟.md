　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: Comprehensive report: The primaries for Congress and governorships, which will have a huge impact on US domestic and foreign policy in the coming years, have been completed in all states except four (Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, and Nevada). In these primaries, due to the active efforts of labor groups and progressive democratic groups, many reactionaries were defeated. According to received news, it is known that Robert M. La Follette Jr., a well-known isolationist for 21 years as a senator, Burton K. Wheeler of Montana (unlike Vandenberg and La Follette, he represented agricultural states that advocated non-intervention in other countries' affairs), and Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota, an anti-New Deal figure, have all been defeated. The North Dakota Farmers Union also cooperated with Democratic progressives to defeat the notorious isolationist Gerald Nye, who was trying to make a comeback (they also defeated him in 1944). The prominent progressive Congressman Jerry Voorhis has been successfully elected. The more progressive Axle Steele, and Lindsay (Governor from 1941-1945), a friend of the famous progressive Senator Claude Pepper, have also won in Maryland and Florida, respectively. The New Deal Senator from New York State, who is considered relatively progressive by the Republican Party, was urged by the reactionary state chairman Curran within the party to withdraw from political life, but he firmly refused. He was elected from the 17th district, receiving 77,000 votes, while the Republican Party in that district only had over 29,000. In this US Congressional election, 35 senators are up for re-election, including 22 Democrats and 13 Republicans. According to the Constitution, one-third, or 32 senators, should be re-elected every two years. However, because Stanleyfield of Kentucky, Young of North Dakota, and Gossett of Idaho were all senators elected in by-elections last year, a total of 35 senators must be re-elected. 36 governorships are up for re-election, including 17 Democrats and 19 Republicans. Among the governors continuing in office, there are 8 Democrats and 4 Republicans. As for members of the House of Representatives, all are up for re-election. Although only the primaries have been held so far, they have already shown that the American people are increasingly awakening, abandoning the reactionary members of Congress elected a few years ago who have now proven unable to represent them.
    Currently, the primaries are mostly over, and there will be a fierce struggle in the official elections in November.

　　美国会预选次第结束
    反动分子不少落选
    显示美国人民正日益觉悟
    【新华社延安十七日电】综合报导：对美国今后数年内政外交有巨大影响的国会及州长之预选，除四州外（即科罗拉多、路易斯安那、密芝根及内华达），其余各州均次第举行完毕。在此次预选中，由于劳工团体及进步民主团体之积极活动，反动分子不少落选。据所收到的消息，已知历任参议员二十一年的战前著名的孤立主义者拉福莱特、蒙大拿州之孤立主义者惠勒（他与范登堡及拉福莱特不同，是主张不问他国事件的农业州区的代表人物）、明尼苏达的反新政分子希普斯德等均已落选。北达科他州的农民联盟亦与民主党进步分子合作，以打败卷土重来之著名孤立主义者奈埃（他在一九四四年亦被他们击败而落选），著名之进步众议员德拉西已胜利当选，较进步之阿克斯迭尔及著名进步参议员泼贝尔之友林赛（一九四一——四五年州长）亦分别在密兰里与佛罗里达获胜。纽约州共和党较称进步的新政参议员，虽为党内的反动的州主席库兰所不满，嘱其退出政治生活，但他坚决拒绝，他是第十七选区选出的，得票七万七千，而该区共和党仅二万九千余。此次美国国会改选参议员三十五人，其中民主党二十二人，共和党十三人。按宪法规定，参议员每二年原应改选三分之一即三十二人，但因坎塔基州之斯丹菲尔、北达科他州之杨格、伊达荷州之哥塞特均系在去年补选之参议员，故共须改选三十五人。州长改选者三十六人，其中民主党十七人，共和党十九人，继续任职之州长中，民主党八人，共和党四人。至众院议员则全部改选，迄今所举行者虽仅为预选，但已显示美国人民正日益觉悟，摒弃在数年前选出的现已证明不能代表他们的反动议员。
    目前预选大部结束，在十一月的正式大选中，尚有一番剧烈的斗争。
