　　Sober Minds Strengthen Self-Defense Preparations
    Taihang Launches Current Affairs Study
    [Changzhi, 30th dispatch] In order to study current affairs, clear their minds, and strengthen self-defense preparations, all troops, organs, and local cadres in the Taihang area have launched current affairs studies to study the CCP's "July 7th" declaration. More than 200 cadres in Licheng District started on the 12th and spent three days, combining it with current work and ideological inspections, to launch discussions and discover complacency. There was a general lack of understanding of the collusion between Chinese reactionaries and American imperialist elements, and the long-term twists and turns of the Chinese revolution. For example, Wang Zhide, director of the Fifth District Military Committee, said: "After Japan surrendered, I always thought in my mind that there would be peace, and armament was no longer important. After reflection, everyone recognized the reactionaries' conspiracy and also recognized that the Chinese people, especially the people in the liberated areas, who have undergone eight years of resistance, have the strength to crush the reactionaries' offensive. [We are] determined to do a better job in production and mass work, strengthen the people's strength, strengthen current affairs education, prepare for self-defense, and strive for peace." He Si, a farmer cadre at an enlarged cadre meeting in Changzhi County, said: "Chiang Kai-shek colludes with bad Americans to bully our old folks. I must do my job well and mobilize the folks to not be bullied by them." Finally, it was decided that in July all cadres would study and publicize the "July 7th" declaration, launch current affairs education, and mobilize the county's masses to defend their hometown and defend the fruits of victory. Cadres of the Third Special District also launched current affairs studies from the 4th to the 10th of this month, and conducted group discussions on the "July 7th" declaration, boldly exposing and solving individual thoughts based on the current situation, and recognizing current work tasks.

　　清醒头脑加强自卫准备
    太行展开时事学习
    【长治三十日电】为研究时事清醒头脑加强自卫准备，太行全区部队机关地方干部，均展开了时事学习，研究中共“七七”宣言。黎城区干部二百余人十二日开始用了三天时间，结合当前的工作和思想检查，展开讨论发现麻痹思想，普遍存在对中国反动派和美帝国主义分子的勾结和中国革命的长期曲折认识不够，如五区武委会主任王志德说：“日本投降后，我思想中总认为和平了，武装不重要了。经过反省，大家认识了反动派阴谋，也认识了经过八年抗战的中国人民，特别是解放区人民是有力量粉碎反动派的进攻，决心更好的作好生产与群众工作，壮大人民力量，加强时事教育，准备自卫，争取和平。长治县扩大干部会议上农民干部何四则说：“蒋介石勾搭美国的坏人来欺负咱老百姓，我一定好好把工作干好，把老百姓动员起来不受他们的欺负。”最后决定七月份全体干部学习与宣传“七七”宣言，展开时事教育，把全县群众动员起来，保卫家乡，保卫胜利果实。三专署干部亦于本月四日到十日，展开了时事学习，分组讨论“七七”宣言，根据目前的时局大胆暴露与解决个人思想，认识当前的工作任务。
