　　Handan Masses Gather to Welcome Righteous Deeds
　　Gentryman Jiao Weiran Donates Land
　　City Salvation Association Formulates Anti-Traitor Liquidation Program; Taihang District Party Committee Calls for Learning from Zhai Shixian

　　[Reported by this newspaper from Handan] On August 2nd, the masses of Jiaojia Kiln in Handan City held a grand meeting to welcome the righteous act of enlightened gentryman Jiao Weiran in donating land to the City People's Association. Amidst the applause of the masses, Jiao said, "These 65 mu of land were seized by warlords Shang Zhen and Huang Guanghua (Note by the reporter: Shang Zhen was then the commander of the Kuomintang 32nd Army, and Huang Guanghua was the commander of the division) before the War of Resistance, and turned into a large parade ground. When the Japanese devils came, they also used it as a parade ground and warehouse. After the democratic government came, it cleaned up the enemy's occupation of the people's property, and returned it to whom it belonged, returning these 65 mu to me. I can't farm so much land now, and many villagers have no land to farm, so I donate it to the City People's Association to be distributed to the villagers who have no land to farm forever. I also have some surplus houses, and if anyone has no place to live, I can give them some." Mr. Jiao also handed over all the land deeds to the City People's Association on the spot to show his sincerity. (Agricultural)

　　[Another Dispatch] In order to further mobilize and organize the broad masses to carry out the anti-traitor liquidation and emancipation movement, the City Salvation Association, after investigating and studying several villages, specially formulated the "Citizens' Anti-Traitor Liquidation Struggle Program" on August 1st, and sent it to various villages for detailed discussion and study in order to thoroughly implement it. The program is divided into seven articles, the contents of which are as follows:

　　1. Thoroughly liquidate the crimes of traitors and compensate for the loss of life and property of the people. Petty traitors should confess their guilt to everyone and start anew.

　　2. Liquidate the corruption and waste of the puppet township governments, indiscriminate spending, sheltering large households, and unfair apportionment. The grain, money, and corvee labor that large households rely on their power to evade or pay less should be investigated and compensated to us.

　　3. Oppose local bullies relying on their power to bully others, and force them to return the houses and land they have seized.

　　4. Oppose false mortgages and false sales, concealing unregistered land, evading burdens, and shifting burdens, where one person benefits and everyone suffers. The grain and money that should be paid should be investigated and compensated to us.

　　5. Thoroughly liquidate high rents, high interest rates, and illegal exploitation without pay, compensate us for our losses, and solve our housing and land difficulties.

　　6. Organize to solve our difficulties with capital and furniture. Use democratic evaluation to reasonably allocate loans, develop factories and handicrafts, and organize cooperatives.

　　7. Brothers who are oppressed and exploited should unite, oppose special agents spreading rumors and scaring us with "changing the sky." Whoever sabotages our emancipation, we will resolutely fight them. Develop membership, organize militias, strengthen our forces, and defend our emancipation. (Xiao Fang)

　　[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] The Taihang District Committee of the Communist Party of China highly commended Comrade Zhai Shixian, a teacher at Peking University, for voluntarily donating land for distribution to poor peasants for cultivation, which is conducive to the development of "land to the tiller." It sent separate letters to Comrade Zhai and the Wu'an County Party Committee to express encouragement and called on all party members in the district to learn from Zhai. The original letters are as follows:

　　(1) Comrade Zhai Shixian: In the spirit of a communist, you have modeled yourself by donating your private property to peasants with little or no land, promoting the emancipation movement led by the Party, and setting an example for Taihang party members and cadres to dedicate land to realize the Party's proposition. This is of great help to the implementation of the Party's land policy. We extend our condolences to you for this exemplary behavior of a party member. Taihang District Committee (August 7th)

　　(2) Comrades of the Wu'an County Party Committee: Comrade Zhai Shixian has earnestly promoted the Party's land policy and implemented the exemplary land donation and distributed his property. You should conduct a general discussion of this exemplary action among party members and cadres: how to sacrifice personal interests and obey the interests of the Party. Call on everyone to learn from Comrade Zhai Shixian. At the same time, after Comrade Shixian's land donation, attention should be paid to the necessary production expenses for his family's livelihood, so as not to suffer from hunger and cold due to the land donation. Taihang District Committee (August 7th)
