    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Tokyo dispatch: A general strike was launched on the 5th at the Kyushu Mitsubishi Zaibatsu coal mines, one of the largest coal mines in Japan. The coal mining company had a capital of 150 million yen in 1936, and after several expansions, it had 80,000 miners in 1944. This strike is a major blow to the Yoshida Cabinet's hopes of increasing coal production, solving power supply problems, and accelerating industrial recovery.
