Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to delayed news from Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party member Okano Susumu, in a Diet interpellation on June 28th, stated: The Communist Party has consistently demanded that the constitution be drafted after being discussed by the majority of the people, with full consideration of the people's opinions, and then submitted to the Diet. Why is the government so eager to complete the constitution? We must correct the undemocratic nature of the constitution's submission to the Diet. The Prime Minister claims that the current constitution possesses democracy and anti-militarism. If the current constitution is a democratic constitution, why is it necessary to enact a new constitution? If the new constitution, as Prime Minister Yoshida says, is a continuation of the current constitution, this is tantamount to admitting that the new constitution is an undemocratic constitution. Regarding the discussion of the constitution, it has not yet been determined whether sovereignty resides in the people or in the Emperor. The Prime Minister says "the people including the Emperor." If the Emperor is a member of the people, then there should be the provision in Article 13 of the draft, which states that the people are equal and should not be discriminated against. If the Emperor is a member of the people, he should be elected by the people. The government says that the Emperor's position comes from the people's feelings. There is no monarchy in the world based solely on the people's feelings. This is nothing more than a new kind of theocracy. Furthermore, there are some differences between the Japanese and English versions of the constitutional draft. If one reads the English version, it seems quite democratic, but if one reads the Japanese version, it is quite ambiguous. Is this not the Japanese constitution's democracy deceiving foreign countries? The Communist Party absolutely opposes leaving any political privileges in the hands of the Emperor and demands the enactment of a thoroughly democratic constitution. The House of Councillors is a new kind of aristocratic house that reduces the powers of the House of Representatives. The Communist Party opposes the House of Councillors and advocates a unicameral system. It also opposes the separation of powers; the executive body should be appointed by the Diet. The draft also stipulates the basic rights of the people. In the current situation, most government agencies are in the hands of capitalists, so their freedom is only the freedom of capitalists. We advocate that the constitution stipulates plans for the poor to fully utilize their freedom and demand that the constitution stipulates various clauses guaranteeing the people's stable and improving lives. The draft also stipulates the abandonment of general war. However, there are two kinds of war: just war and unjust war. The so-called unjust war is a war of aggression. A war fought to defend oneself against unjust aggression is a just war. Our constitution should clearly state the abandonment of wars of aggression and should not only say the abandonment of general war. From this, it can be seen that the government's intention is only to use the smoke screen of democracy to cover up the undemocratic nature of the new constitutional draft, to use the pretense of sovereignty residing in the people to cover up the essence of sovereignty residing in the monarch, in an attempt to continue the dominance of capitalists, bureaucrats, and landlords.

　　冈野进议会质问政府
    揭露宪草非民主性
    反对天皇保留丝毫政治特权
    【新华社延安廿八日电】据东京迟到消息：日共产党议员冈野进，六月廿八日在议会质问政府称：共产党一向要求宪法经大多数人民加以讨论，充分采纳人民之意见后始行起草，然后提出议会，政府何以如此急欲完成宪法？吾人须纠正宪法提出议会之非民主性。首相谓现行宪法具有民主主义性和反军国主义性，现行宪法倘系民主宪法，何须制定新宪法？新宪法倘如吉田首相所言系现行宪法之继续，这无异自白新宪法系非民主宪法。关于宪法之讨论，迄今未确定主权在国民之手抑在天皇之手，首相谓“包含天皇之国民”，倘天皇系国民，则有该草案第十三条所谓国民系平等，并不加以差别之规定；倘天皇系国民，应由人民选举。政府谓天皇之地位出自国民之感情，世界并无仅以国民之感情为基础之君主制，此不外系一种新式神权而已。又宪草之日文与英文间有若干差异，倘看英文颇有民主性，然看日文则颇含糊，此非向外国欺骗之日本宪法之民主性乎？共产党绝对反对留丝毫政治特权于天皇手中，并要求制定彻底民主之宪法。参议院乃缩小众议院权限之新式贵族院，共产党反对参议院，而主张一院制，又反对三权分立，执行机关应由议会任命。草案又规定国民之基本权利。如目前情形政府机关大部分握于资本家手中，则其自由仅系资本家之自由而已。吾人主张宪法规定得有穷人充分利用自由之计划，并要求宪法规定保证人民生活安定向上之各种条款。宪草又规定放弃一般战争，然战争有正当之战争及不正当之战争两种，所谓不正当之战争即侵略战争，对不正当之侵略战争为防卫自己而战之战争，乃正义之战争。吾人之宪草应明言放弃侵略战争，不应只谓放弃一般战争。由是观之，政府用意仅在以民主烟幕掩蔽新宪草之非民主性，以主权在民之假装，掩蔽新宪草主权在君之本质，以图延续资本家、官僚、地主之支配。
