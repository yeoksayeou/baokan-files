　　Victory Belongs to the People
　　Sun Dingguo
　　On this day last year, the entire military and civilians of the Taiyue Region, like other liberated areas, responded to the call and orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. With unparalleled courage, they used the strength prepared over the past eight years for the sacred task of accepting the enemy's surrender and launching counterattacks. On August 14th, they approached the Yuncheng Salt Pond, forcing the Japanese Kou, Shao Jiubao, to issue a plea for surrender; on the 17th, they recovered the two cities of Xiaxian and Pinglu, completely severing the Tongpu southern section of the railway and clearing the large and small strongholds along both sides of the river. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's Sixteenth Army, Yan Xishan's Thirty-fourth Army, Nineteenth Army, and Sixty-first Army, cooperated with the enemy and colluded with the puppets to support the enemy. They joined the enemy who wanted to surrender and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in launching an offensive and massacre against the people. The common people said it well: "When the Japanese came, Lao Jiang and Lao Yan left, and they didn't want the common people; when the Eighth Route Army fought until the Japanese surrendered, Lao Jiang and Lao Yan came again, and they came to kill the common people." The Eighth Route Army and the common people are not afraid of being killed. If you want to kill them, they know how to deal with the killers. Therefore, under duress, the Eighth Route Army and the common people had to engage in five months of self-defense war, repelling countless enemy attacks, and finally, in coordination with the military and civilians of Taihang, recovered the famous city of Changzhi, which had always been surrounded by the Eighth Route Army, and achieved victory. It was thought that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan would clear their heads, and after the pain, retreat in the face of difficulty. Especially for the sake of the Chinese people, to get out of the sea of war and embark on peaceful construction, our party and the national democrats made concerted efforts, and Chairman Mao went to Chongqing with great wisdom and courage; finally, after all the efforts of the Political Consultative Conference and the major concessions of our party, the famous truce, military reorganization, and Political Consultative Conference resolutions were established. Chiang Kai-shek hypocritically issued four promises, and it was time to put down the butcher knife. But the result was the opposite. After our army resolutely implemented the ceasefire order and painfully withdrew from Quwo, what we got in return was further attacks and massacres by Chiang and Yan. To this day, the vast liberated areas of southern Shanxi along the Tongpu line and the Yellow River coast have been ignited by the flames of war by warmongers, and the democratic and free life of the liberated areas is about to return to darkness. Chiang Kai-shek's ambition to fear that the world will not be in chaos, that China will not perish, and that the people will not die is becoming more and more obvious; his murderous face is becoming clearer and clearer; and his traitorous and country-selling behavior is becoming more and more unprecedentedly cruel and vicious; especially with the support of American imperialist elements, he is becoming more and more energetic. The military and civilians of the Taiyue Region, like the military and civilians of other liberated areas, are military and civilians who have been tempered by eight years of anti-Japanese war and nearly a year of self-defense war. Japanese imperialism cannot eliminate us, American imperialist elements cannot scare us, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot defeat us. We are military and civilians under the leadership of the Communist Party, military and civilians supported by the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world and China, and military and civilians who have been cultivated and educated for many years by Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of not surrendering. We resolutely support peace. For the sake of peace, we have been so painfully patient in the past, but there is a limit to concessions. At the same time, we are most resolutely opposed to civil war. For the sake of peace, we also understand how to carry out the most resolute struggle. Comrades fighting in the entire region! Comrades of the militia and self-defense forces! We are the people's own soldiers, we are the protectors of the people's interests, we should be very resolutely with the people, and in order to defend the motherland, defend victory, and defend peace and democracy, give Chiang Kai-shek's offensive the punishment it deserves! Let us raise six million iron fists to give those attackers a severe blow! We welcome the people in the rear to fight with us; we welcome Chiang and Yan's officers and soldiers to oppose the civil war for the sake of the motherland and the people, and also for their own sake, and to learn from General Gao Shuxun, Captain Liu Shanben, General Lei Wenqing, and all the anti-civil war soldiers of the Lei Department. We welcome the American people and democrats to join us in stopping American imperialist elements from helping Chiang Kai-shek. The great August 10th Victory Day belongs to the people, and the victory of peace and democracy must also belong to the people.

　　胜利是人民的
    孙定国
    太岳区全体军民在去年的今日，和其他解放区一样响应了毛主席朱总司令的号召与命令，以英勇无比的姿态，把八年来准备的力量使用在接受敌人投降与反攻的神圣任务上，八月十四日接近了运城盐池，迫使日寇少久保发出了乞降的哀鸣；十七日收复了夏县、平陆两城，整个打断同蒲南段铁路，以及肃清沿河两侧的大小据点。就在这个时候蒋介石的十六军，阎锡山的三十四军，十九军、六十一军，用与敌合作、与伪合流的方式来给敌人撑了腰。使要投降的敌人与蒋介石阎锡山在一起，开始了对人民的进攻和大屠杀。老百姓讲的好：“日本人来了，老蒋老阎就走了，走了是不要老百姓；八路军打得日本人投降了，老蒋老阎又来了，来了是杀老百姓。”八路军和老百姓是不怕杀的，你要杀他，他知道怎样对付杀人者。因之，在被迫的情况下，八路军和老百姓就不得不进行了五个月的自卫战争，打退了敌人无数次的进攻，终于与太行军民配合，收复了始终在八路军包围中的长治名城，取得胜利。方以为蒋介石、阎锡山会清醒一下头脑，创痛之余，知难而退，特别是为了中国老百姓，脱离战争苦海走上和平建设，我党与全国民主人士一致努力，毛主席大智大勇，亲到重庆；最后经过政协一切努力与我党重大让步，成立了有名的停战、整军与政协决议。蒋介石假惺惺的发布了四项诺言，应是放下杀人刀的时候了。而其结果又相反，在我军坚决执行停战命令忍痛退出曲沃之后，换得来的又是蒋阎的进一步的进攻和大屠杀。时至今日，同蒲沿线，黄河沿岸我晋南的广大解放区，已由好战分子的手燃起了大战的烽火，要解放区的民主自由生活再回到黑暗中去。蒋介石唯恐天下不乱，中国不亡，人民不死的野心是暴露得愈来愈明显了；他这一付杀人的狰狞面目，愈来愈清楚了；汉奸卖国的行为，也愈来愈加空前残酷与毒辣了；特别是在美帝国主义分子支持之下，更是愈来愈有劲头了。太岳区军民和其它解放区军民一样，是经过八年抗日锻炼的军民，是将近一年来自卫战争的军民了，日本帝国主义消灭不了我们，美帝国主义分子就吓不倒我们，蒋介石就打不败我们，我们是在共产党领导之下的军民，是在全世界全中国和平民主势力拥护与支持下的军民，是在毛主席没有屈服两个字的指导思想陶冶与教育多年的军民。我们坚决拥护和平，为了和平我们过去如何的忍痛的，但是有限度的让步，同时我们又最坚决反对内战，为了和平我们又了解如何的进行最坚决的斗争。全区作战的同志们！民兵自卫队同志们！我们是人民的子弟兵，我们是人民利益的保卫者，我们应十分坚决的和人民在一起，为了保卫祖国、保卫胜利、保卫和平民主，给蒋介石的进攻以应有的惩罚吧！让我们举起六百万只铁拳给那些进攻者以严重打击！我们欢迎大后方的人民和我们一起来斗争；我们欢迎蒋阎军官兵为祖国为人民计，同时也是为自己计，反对内战，学习高树勋将军、刘善本上尉、雷文清将军与雷部全体反内战的士兵同志。我们欢迎美国人民民主人士和我们一起制止美国帝国主义分子对蒋介石的帮助。伟大的八月十日的胜利日，是属于人民的，和平、民主的胜利，也一定是人民的。
