　　Wu'an Merchants Recognize Industrial and Commercial Policies
　　Voluntarily Report Concealed Materials
　　Government Commends Self-Reporting Households, Resolves to Protect Private Capital
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Following Han Xiuli's voluntary contribution of capital in Wu'an City's business sector, it once caused a shock. Some special agent saboteurs spread rumors saying, "This is terrible! The government will be even more suspicious of all merchants and will thoroughly defeat them." Individual merchants who did not understand the overall situation also spread unfavorable sentiments, saying, "Han Xiuli is attacking commerce and bringing disaster upon us," and as a result, a small number of businesses transported and concealed materials. However, the government declined to accept Han's materials, and the masses only reasonably liquidated a very small portion, with the majority still belonging to Han. The government and the masses also encouraged him to invest in industry and commerce. This shattered the special agents' absurd rumors. Merchants generally believed that the democratic government's policies were genuine, and they voluntarily reported materials buried underground. In just the two days of the 12th and 13th, more than ten foreign cloth shops, silk shops, and general merchandise stores, such as Deyuancheng, Yuxinhe, Hengfengheng, Fulixiang, and Longji, reported more than 120 rolls of foreign cloth, dyes, bicycle parts, and many other items. Businesses with traitor materials or shares, such as Ruifengxiang Foreign Cloth Shop, Hengtaixiang, Huachangde General Merchandise Store, and Zhongheying Cigarette Shop, also voluntarily contributed over 500,000 yuan of capital held by traitors Wang Junqing, drug dealer Li Fu's, puppet police officer Jiang Tiyuan, and puppet Li Pinsan Self-Government Army Secretary Yang Wenxiang. It is reported that the government has issued a notice commending businesses that voluntarily report traitor assets and guaranteeing that their private capital will not be harmed. They were once again encouraged to continue boldly investing materials into the market, and the government will guarantee this. Currently, in Wu'an City, the removal of buried materials is heard of daily.

　　武安商人认识工商业政策
　　纷纷自报掩藏物资
　　政府表扬自报户，决保护私人资本
    【本报讯】武安城商业界在韩修礼自动献资后，曾引起一度震荡。有些特务破坏分子造谣说：“这一下可了不得啊！政府更要怀疑所有商人，要彻底斗垮”。个别不明大义的商人也散布不利空气，说：“韩修礼是打击商业、给咱招祸”，因之少数商号即运藏物资。但政府谢绝接受韩的物资，群众只合理清算了极少一部，大批仍归韩所有，政府与群众并勉其投资工商业，这打垮了特务分子的无稽谣言，商人咸信民主政府政策真实，纷纷自动报出掩埋地下之物资，仅十二、十三两日内已有德源成、裕信和、恒丰亨、福利祥、隆记等十余家洋布庄、绸缎庄、广杂货行，报出洋布百二十余匹，颜料自行车零件等甚多。存有汉奸物资或股金的商号如瑞丰祥洋布庄、恒泰祥、华昌德杂货行、中和英烟庄等，亦均自动献出汉奸王俊卿、毒犯李富的、伪警官姜体元、伪李聘三自治军书记杨文祥等所存之资本五十余万元。闻政府已通告表扬自动报告汉奸资财的商号，并保证不损害其私人资本。再次勉励商人继续大胆把物资投进市场去，政府决予以保障。现武安城内搬出掩埋之物资者，日有所闻。（一帆）
