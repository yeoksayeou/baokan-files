　　Longhai Chiang Troops Attempt to Continue Offensive
    Our Self-Defense Forces Stand Ready
    [Report from our newspaper in Handan, 27th] Following our army's victory in the Longhai Self-Defense Counter-Attack, having annihilated over 16,000 Chiang troops, recovered five county towns and twelve train stations, and controlled 380 li of railway line, dealing a serious blow to the Chiang army's offensive system, Chiang Kai-shek became flustered and hastily transferred forces originally scheduled to be drawn from the Wuhan, Southern Henan, Western Hubei, Southern Shaanxi, and Huainan battlefields, rapidly reinforcing the Longhai front in an attempt to continue a larger-scale offensive against our liberated areas on both sides of the Longhai Railway. It is reported that in recent days, passenger trains on the Longhai, Pinghan, Xinbian, and Jinpu lines have been suspended and are being used exclusively to transport troops. The main forces of the Chiang army on the Longhai front, namely the two brigades of Chen Zongqiao's 41st Division, one brigade of Chen Dingxun's 47th Division, and two brigades of Zhao Xitian's Reorganized 3rd Division, which were originally pursuing our Li Xiannian's troops in the Longjuzhai area, were all transferred east around ten days ago and have now arrived at the front to join the battle, advancing in three routes, and have successively occupied our Sanyizhai, Luowang Station, and Lanfeng City. The 311th Brigade of its Reorganized 3rd Division is advancing from Changyuan towards the north of Kaocheng, attempting to attack our Dongming City, and is simultaneously coordinating with the 49th Brigade of the 27th Army on the Pinghan Line in Northern Henan, as well as the puppet troops of Sun Dianying and Cheng Daosheng, attempting to occupy our Junxian area, and has already occupied our Wulingji in Tangyin. The 40th Army, originally stationed in Anyang, is attacking westward and has already occupied our Qugou Town. The 18th Brigade of the 18th Division and the notoriously known surrendered enemy general Fang Xianjue's 81st Division, advancing west from Xuzhou, are cooperating with local bandits Geng Jixun and the Northern Jiangsu Security Brigade, and on the 19th, separately occupied our Dangshan and Peixian. Our district's military and civilians are separately engaging in resistance, with fierce fighting underway on all fronts. In summary, the Chiang army's intention is to reoccupy the area along the Longhai Railway and launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas north and south of the railway. Our border region's soldiers and militia are standing ready, preparing to give the invading army a devastating blow at any time.

    【本报邯郸二十七日电】陇海自卫反击战，我军获胜，歼灭蒋军一万六千余，收复县城五座、车站十二个、控制三百八十里铁路线，予蒋军进攻体系以严重打击，使蒋介石手忙脚乱，急调预定由武汉、豫南、鄂西、陕南、淮南等战场抽调之兵力，迅速增至陇海前线，以图更大规模的向我陇海路两侧解放区继续进攻。据悉：连日陇海、平汉、新汴、津浦各线之客车均已停开，专门用来运兵。在陇海方面蒋军之主力部队，为原在龙驹寨一带追击我李先念部队四十一师陈宗樵两个旅、四十七陈鼎师勋一个旅及整三师赵锡田两个旅，均于十日前后东调，现已到达前线加入作战，分三路前进，已先后占我三义寨、罗王车站及兰封城。其整三师三百一十一旅则由长垣向考城以北推进，企图进攻我东明城，同时并配合以平汉线豫北之二十七军四十九旅及伪军孙殿英、程道生部，企图占我浚县地区，刻已占我汤阴之五陵集。原驻安阳之第四十军则向西进攻，并已占我曲沟镇。由徐州西犯之十八师十八旅及臭名远扬之降敌名将八十一师方先觉部，配合土顽耿继勋、苏北保安旅，十九日分别进占我砀山沛县。我区军民分头迎击，各线正在激战中。综观蒋军意图，在于重新占领陇海路沿线，并向铁路南北解放区作大规模的进攻，我边区子弟兵和民兵正严阵以待，准备随时给予进犯军以歼灭性的打击。
