[Reported by our Yangcheng Correspondent] On the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, the people of Shimu Village in Gaoping celebrate their self-designated Emancipation Day, marking their liberation. This year, over ten thousand people from the surrounding dozens of *li* gathered to celebrate. There were twelve various lively performances and six theater troupes to add to the festivities, with content celebrating emancipation, opposing the civil war, and opposing Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. A celebration meeting was held on the sixteenth, beginning with a report by Zhou Jiangfa, chairman of the Shimu Farmers' Association, on the village's emancipation struggle. He said, "In Shimu, every family now has food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, and every household has land to cultivate. We no longer suffer the hardships of the past. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we live a well-fed and clothed life. We will never forget the Communist Party for our emancipation, and we will never forget the Eighth Route Army for our liberation. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao!" Emancipated farmer Xu Tianlin said, "Our emancipation was not easy; it came after much struggle. Now the reactionaries want to seize our fruits and sell them to the United States. We must resolutely fight them to the end! We firmly oppose betraying the country!" After recounting his own emancipation experience, veteran soldier Zhao Lianggen took out a letter from his pocket, intending to send it to Chairman Mao. The people of Shimu Village wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Today is the anniversary of the day the people of Shimu Village were freed from the thousand-pound stone slab. We recall the unbearable suffering we endured under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the old society. Today, you have led us to emancipation, giving us food, clothing, and land to cultivate. We are united, help each other, and engage in large-scale production. We cannot help but rejoice. We must defend this good life and resolutely repel the attack of the reactionaries." The meeting lasted for three days, culminating in a parade and demonstration, with groups spreading propaganda. Under the slogan "The fruits of victory are blood and sweat; whoever tries to seize them will face our resistance!" the masses have begun to take action, determined to support the front lines and strive for the complete victory of the emancipation self-defense and patriotic war.
