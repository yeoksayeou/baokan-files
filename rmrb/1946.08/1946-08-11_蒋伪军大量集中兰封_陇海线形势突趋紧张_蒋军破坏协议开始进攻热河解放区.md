　　[Heze Correspondent, August 1st] Chiang Kai-shek's troops "suppressing" the Yudong (Eastern Henan) liberated areas are currently concentrating in large numbers in Lanfeng along the Longhai Railway, attempting a surprise attack against us. The No. 1 Army of Wang Kangde under the command of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng, one of the main forces participating in the Yudong "suppression", moved from Zhecheng area to the Longhai line east of Lanfeng at the end of last month. The 81st Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's army has also been transferred from Qi County, the central area of eastern Henan, to Chenliu, southwest of Lanfeng. The remaining defense tasks are carried out with key deployments. On the one hand, small groups of troops are sent out to harass us daily, and on the other hand, fortifications are being built to continue their "suppression" of eastern Henan. On the 23rd, Liu Maoen, Chairman of Henan Province, personally went to Lanfeng to mobilize the Chiang Kai-shek's troops concentrated in the area for a civil war. He also gave secret instructions to a certain Hu, the administrative commissioner of the Kuomintang in the area, urging him to quickly supervise the local military and civilians to rush to repair the fortifications along the line, and put forward slogans such as "recovering" lost land from us. Currently, there are four ammunition depots storing ammunition in Lanfeng city. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the area are seizing laborers to rush to repair the two supply lines of grain, forage, and ammunition from Lanfeng to Kaocheng and from Lanfeng to Liuhezhen (north of Zhongling). The situation on the Longhai Railway is now suddenly becoming tense.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, August 8th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops entrenched in Qingyangdian, 35 miles west of Zouping City, frequently harassed us. The local militia, in coordination with the Eighth Route Army, counterattacked on the night of the 1st, killing and wounding over a hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, capturing over thirty alive, and seizing seven machine guns. On the morning of the 2nd, the 96th Army of the Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who had invaded Zouping, Zhangqiu, and other places, rushed to reinforce them, but were troubled by the militia's minefields and then defeated by the Eighth Route Army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, August 7th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Jinzhou-Gubeikou line have begun attacking the Rehe liberated area. On the 30th of last month, two regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Yebaishou advanced along the Chifeng-Yebaishou Railway. As of the 2nd of this month, they have successively occupied the two towns of Tianyi and Nailin. A regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Lingyuan advanced north, echoing the Chiang Kai-shek's troops on both sides of the Chifeng-Yebaishou line, and successively occupied Reshuitang, over a hundred miles northeast of Lingyuan, and Banjaying and Haizhongnao and other places northwest of Lingyuan on the 1st. As of the 5th, the war is still expanding. Duan Suquan, Major General and the Communist Party representative of the Central Group of the Chengde Executive Headquarters, has submitted a memorandum to the Beiping Executive Headquarters regarding the provocation of the Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacking the Rehe liberated area, recounting the Kuomintang's violation of the agreement reached between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the 26th Group in Chaoyang before July 25 to hold a chiefs' meeting, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek's troops' offensive actions be stopped, otherwise the Kuomintang will be responsible for all the consequences.
