　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 23rd: The water level in the Grand Canal continues to rise, and some areas have been flooded. A reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Construction Department of the Border Government to inquire about the recent situation. According to reports, there have been continuous heavy rains this month, measuring 7.7 inches, exceeding the rainfall in April of last year by 4.7 inches. The canal water has risen sharply. Taking Qingjiang as an example: on the 14th, the water level was 24 feet 3 inches, on the 17th it was 25 feet 6 inches, and on the 18th it was 26 feet 6 inches, with a continuing upward trend. However, as long as the Lanjiang and Guashan dams among the ten Guijiang dams controlled by the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou are opened, the canal's rising water can be diverted into the Yangtze River to avoid disaster. However, although the democratic government has repeatedly requested their opening, the two dams remain blocked to this day. The Kuomintang authorities in Donghai County have also blocked the Qiangwei River in the Huaihai area, preventing the Shu River from flowing smoothly into the sea, which further increases the burden on the canal, causing waterlogging in low-lying areas in northern Huaihai and along Hongze Lake. As for Mr. Chen Cheng's statement that "Mr. Zhou Enlai submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan regarding the rising water level in the canal, requesting the opening of five dams on the canal. I believe that with both the Yangtze River and Hongze Lake experiencing rising water levels, whether opening the five dams on the canal can accommodate the discharge volume should be jointly surveyed by both parties and experts," it is particularly ignorant and laughable. According to historical precedent, the water from the Huai River entering the Yangtze River dates back 200 years. The Huai River Diversion Plan formulated by the Kuomintang Huai River Diversion Committee also stipulates "30% into the sea (now even the sea is not allowed), 70% into the Yangtze River." What is the need for a "joint survey"? According to Mr. Chen's opinion, if the vast Yangtze River cannot accommodate the canal's discharge, then such a large amount of water blocked in the canal can only burst its banks. The Kuomintang authorities are not only preventing the canal's rising water from flowing into the Yangtze River and the sea, but also doing everything possible to sabotage the major dike construction and flood prevention projects. Their intentions are already obvious. Currently, our democratic government, in addition to leading the military and civilians to step up flood prevention projects, is also urging various places along the river and lake to immediately harvest and transport the ripe crops to higher ground, doing everything possible to minimize losses. However, we still hope that the Kuomintang authorities will immediately stop blocking and all destructive water conservancy behaviors, valuing the lives of the people and upholding humanity.

### 国民党坚不开坝阴谋昭然  运河续涨部分地区成灾

　　国民党坚不开坝阴谋昭然
    运河续涨部分地区成灾
    【新华社淮阴二十三日电】运河水势续涨，部分地区已泛滥成灾。记者特走访边府建设厅负责人探询近况，据谈本月以来，曾连遭霪雨，计量七寸七分，超过去年四月份雨量四寸七分。运河水陡涨不已。以清江为例：十四日水位为二丈四尺三寸，十七日为二丈五尺六寸，十八日即为二丈六尺六寸，且有续涨之势。但只要控制在扬州国民党当局手中归江十坝中之拦江、褂山两坝开放，运河涨水入江即可免于成灾。但该两坝虽经民主政府一再请其开放，然迄今堵塞如故。东海国民党当局，且在淮海地区堵塞蔷薇河，使沭水无法畅流入海，因而更加重运河负担，致淮海北部及洪泽湖沿岸一带洼地已遭受水滥之灾。至陈诚氏所称：“周恩来先生以运河水涨，曾向行政院提出备忘录，要求开放运河五坝。余意值兹长江洪泽均告水涨，开放运河五坝后，能否容纳排泄量，应由双方及专家合勘”等语，尤为无知可笑。按淮运之水入江已有二百年历史，国民党导淮委员会所订导淮计划亦有“三分入海，（现在海也不准入）七分入江”之规定，何须“合勘”？依陈氏意见，浩浩大江尚不能容纳运河排泄量，则如许水量堵在运河里，当然只有横决一途。国民党当局，不但阻止运河涨水归江与归海，并对大眺防泛工程，百般破坏之用意何在，已昭然若揭。现我民主政府除领导军民加紧防泛工程外，同时督促沿河沿湖各地，对已熟禾稼立即收割运置高地，尽一切可能争取少受损失。但仍望国民党当局，立即停止堵塞及一切破坏水利行为，以重民命而维人道。
