　　Large-Scale Anti-Traitor and Grievance-Airing Movement About to Unfold
	Ji'nan Farmers' Turn-Over Teams Go to the Countryside
	Taihang District Jingxing and Other Counties Organize Turn-Over Teams
[This newspaper's Weixian [now Wei County, Hebei] dispatch] Ji'nan [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] area’s farmer turn-over teams are heading to the countryside one after another. Focusing on the newly liberated areas of the Second Sub-district, such as Gaotang, Xiajin, Enxian, and Pingyuan, 200 cadres have been transferred from the Ji'nan Party School, 250 cadres have been transferred from the First, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-districts, and another 20-30 work teams have been organized in each county to go deep into the villages to assist the masses in carrying out the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. The Second Sub-district’s turn-over team, led by Comrade Han Ningfu, has more than 200 members, with 100 dispersed in the three districts of Wu Xun, the four districts of Linqing, the three districts of Shenxian, the two districts of Guanxian, and Linqing City; another 100 are going to Qingping. Currently, the entire district's 1,500 villages are surging into the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. The Third Sub-district's turn-over brigade has more than 1,000 people and has been dispatched to various counties, with 500 to Linzhang and 100 each to Handan, Chengci, Feixiang, and Weixian. In addition, 200 people from three work teams of the Prefectural Office, the District Committee, and the Military Committee have also gone to the countryside. The heated anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement is about to be launched on a large scale in all the newly liberated areas of Ji'nan.
　　Changzhi Dispatch: In Jingxing, Yuanshi, Gaoyi, and Zanhuang counties in the First Special District, due to the tense border struggle and the poor development of mass movements, the Prefectural Office has specially selected 600 cadres at the county, district, and village levels to form a "Farmers' Turn-Over Work Team." After short-term study, they will be dispatched to various places to lead the farmers' turn-over. Training began on the 12th of last month. Comrade Wu Zhensheng, Minister of the District Civil Affairs Department, pointed out at the beginning of the training: Our turn-over team has no other meaning, but only to completely sweep away the feudal landlords, bullies, and reactionary forces, so that farmers can turn over from under the big stone slabs of landlords, bullies, and other feudal forces, strengthen the people's democratic forces, defend the liberated areas, and defend peace. All students have high enthusiasm and experience and will be able to undertake this historical task.
