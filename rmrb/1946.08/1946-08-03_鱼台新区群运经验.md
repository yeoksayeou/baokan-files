　　Yutai New District Mass Movement Experience

    Since the work shift in Yutai New District in early May, in one month, 90% of the villages in the county's five new districts have launched a vigorous mass movement to oppose traitors, settle accounts, and overturn grain and interest debts. More than 50% of the population in over a hundred villages have been organized into farmers' associations, women's associations, children's corps, and rifle squads. Struggles and reasoning are taking place everywhere, and songs and shouting exercises are heard all around. It is a vibrant, earth-shattering, and newly emerging atmosphere.

    How was the movement launched on such a large scale?

    I. Letting Go

    In the past, the leadership and cadres were not sufficiently open-handed. They encouraged the masses to "move," but when the masses wanted to take action, the cadres immediately instructed them: "This is good," "That is not good"... Their thinking was that it was better to move "slowly" than to move "steadily." The masses said, "They (referring to the cadres) want the horse to give birth to a foal, but they are afraid of killing the horse by squeezing it," "How can we ever turn ourselves over?" The leadership discovered this problem and decided to let go, starting first with the leadership and cadres. The Yaotun District cadre meeting resolved this problem well. The leading comrades told the cadres: "1. Our only purpose is to get the masses to take action. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. The biggest mistake is when the masses don't take action. 2. Don't mechanically execute the old liberated area's pattern of anti-treason, grievance telling, rent reduction, and debt clearing. Don't try to fit the masses into our mold. Inspire them to do whatever they want." He didn't talk too much about policy, but only emphasized: Let go and do it, as long as it doesn't violate the interests of the middle peasants. The cadres grasped the new spirit and were all excited. They propagated and inspired the masses, and the masses changed from suspicion to closeness to us. The cadres were overwhelmed, and problems were discovered one after another. The dull atmosphere was broken.

    II. Vigorously Supporting the Masses

    Only by vigorously supporting the masses and resolutely suppressing evil can the long-oppressed masses dare to act boldly and quickly. Combining with the propaganda offensive, the government arrested the hidden enemy and puppet remnants, let them reflect collectively, removed the heavy pressure on the masses' heads, released those with minor crimes after "washing their faces," and handed over those with serious crimes to the masses for meetings and struggles. This top-down support prepared excellent conditions for the development of the movement.

    III. Joint Struggle - Village-by-Village Brewing, Lighting Fires Everywhere

    When Li Ge District turned to the liquidation movement, many cadres subjectively felt that the masses were not sufficiently awakened and lacked experience in struggle. They insisted on fighting a few small battles first to train themselves, so they did not dare to lead the struggle against the big traitor – Li Huaiyang, the puppet county self-defense regiment leader. However, the suffering that Li had inflicted on the masses was too great. The people were very angry and irritated when they saw the more than 50 tall buildings he had built with their own blood and sweat. They said, "To catch a thief, first catch the king," "If you take down one big bad guy, the little bad guys will cry without being beaten," advocating fighting Li first. The leadership accepted this opinion. After five days of brewing, they organized a struggle meeting of more than 15,000 people against Li. Li was overthrown. At the meeting, the masses truly saw their own strength, and the meeting itself played a role in supporting each other. They all said, "Li Huaiyang has been struggled against, what else is there to be afraid of?" After the meeting, the cadres took advantage of the heat and went down to assist the activists, brewing village by village, lighting fires everywhere. Large and small struggles were widely launched. Out of the 130 villages in the district, 129 were involved in the movement.

    Joint struggle requires strong leadership, otherwise it is easy to form factional struggles. Paying attention to handling the fruits of struggle can overcome this possible tendency. The leadership has proposed the spirit of "big villages giving way to small villages, poor villages dividing more, rich villages dividing less. Small villages dividing more, big villages dividing less." After the masses discussed and brewed it, it was quickly distributed and handled. At the same time, in joint actions, it is also necessary to carry out timely education on "poor people all over the world are one family" and "unity is strength."

    Fast, hot, and chaotic are the characteristics of the initial launch of the mass movement in the new district. The leadership should have the attitude of not being afraid of chaos, but only of not being able to move; not seeking to move well, but only seeking to move. But when the situation is opened up and the masses move, the leadership should grasp the phenomenon of "inter-village struggle" in some villages that are focused on purely seizing the fruits, and promptly emphasize the division of village struggles, mobilize the masses in the village to struggle and reason with the rulers in the village, and strengthen class education and policy education, so that the movement can be deepened and improved.

    IV. "Drill Through Every Crack", Move Whenever Possible, Organize in Time, Struggle in Time

    The work base in the new district is relatively poor. In the early stage of the movement, the majority of the masses are often willing to turn themselves over, but they are hesitant and watching the movement, unwilling to take the lead. A few bold and daring poor people are eager to turn themselves over and struggle. At this time, the old liberated area's experience of "incubating ideas until mature, waiting for the majority to consciously think before acting" cannot be mechanically applied. This will delay time, which is not in line with the new district's law of the masses' urgent demand to turn themselves over. It will also give the enemy and puppet feudal forces time to organize defenses and sabotage, and the activists will feel suppressed and their morale will drop. The correct leadership should be to move whenever possible, drill through every crack, on the one hand not relaxing the education of the few activists on "there is strength in numbers," so that they can more "connect" with other masses, on the other hand letting go and letting the masses take action, using living struggle materials to educate the majority, and constantly expanding mass organizations and raising mass awareness. Dazhuang Village in Luotun District is the home of the big traitor Guo Kunchi, a famous village of "plucking feathers from passing geese," and the ruling power is strong. In the beginning, a few people actively participated and struggled against the puppet Baochang (village head) - landlord Guo Fengming. At that time, all the villagers participated. After the victory, the leadership immediately summarized this struggle and educated everyone. The morale of the masses was extremely high. They were willing to actively participate in future struggles. On the same day, the farmers expanded by more than 30 people.

### 鱼台新区群运经验

　　鱼台新区群运经验
    鱼台新区自五月初工作转变后，一个月的时间，全县五个新区中有百分之九十的村庄，开展了轰轰烈烈的反奸清算、倒粮倒息的大规模群众运动。一百多个村庄组织了百分之五十以上的人口到农会、妇会、儿童团和钢枪班中。到处都在斗争说理，遍地是歌声和喊操声。轰轰烈烈，天翻地覆，一片新生的气象。
    运动是怎样大规模开展起来的呢？
    一、放手
    在过去，领导上和干部们曾经是不够放手的。他们鼓动群众“动起来”，但是群众要行动了，干部们又马上向群众嘱咐：“这样才好”、“那样不好”……他们的思想是宁可动得“慢”，也要动的“稳”。群众说：“他们（指干部）又要马生驹，又怕蹙死马”，“咱到底怎样翻身呀？”领导上发现了这个问题，决定要放手，并且首先要从领导上、干部中作起。腰屯区的干部会很好的解决了这个问题。领导同志向干部说：“一、我们的唯一目的是让群众行动起来，不要怕犯错误，只有群众行动不起来才是最大的错误。二、不要机械执行老区反奸诉苦——减租清债的规律，不要以我们的圈子去套群众，群众愿作什么就启发他作什么。”他没有过多的谈政策，只是强调提出：放手去作，只要不违犯中农利益就行了。干部们掌握了新的精神个个兴高彩烈，他们向群众宣传启发，群众也一变怀疑为亲近我们了。干部迎接不暇，问题陆续发现。沉闷的空气打破了。
    二、大力给群众撑腰
    只有大力给群众撑腰，坚决镇压邪气，久受压迫的群众才能大胆迅速的行动起来。政府结合着宣传攻势，逮捕了隐匿的敌伪残余分子，让他们集中反省，去掉群众头上的重压，罪轻的“洗脸”后释放，罪重的交给群众开会斗争。这种从上而下的撑腰，给运动的开展准备了优良的条件。
    三、联合斗争——村村酝酿、到处点火
    李阁区转向清算运动时，许多干部主观上感觉群众觉悟不够，斗争经验缺乏，坚持先打几个小仗锻炼一下，因此不敢领导斗争大汉奸——伪县自卫团长李怀阳。但是，李逆给群众的痛苦太大了，老百姓看到他以自己的血汗建造的五十多间高大楼房，就非常气愤刺眼，他们说：“擒贼先擒王”、“一整大坏蛋，小坏蛋不打自叫唤”，主张先斗李逆。领导上接受了这个意见，经过五天的酝酿，便组织了个一万五千余人的斗争李逆大会。把李逆斗倒了。群众在会上真正看见了自己的力量，会的本身就起了互相撑腰的作用。都说：“李怀阳都斗争了，还怕啥？”会后干部乘热钻下去，协助积极分子，村村酝酿，到处点火，大的小的斗争普遍开展起来，全区一百三十个村，一百二十九个卷入了运动。
    联合斗争需要强力的领导，否则容易形成宗派斗争。注意处理斗争果实，可克服这种可能的倾向。领导上曾提出“大村让小村，穷庄多分富庄少分。小庄多分大庄少分”的精神。通过群众酝酿讨论后迅速分配处理。同时在联合行动中还要及时进行“天下穷人是一家”、“团结起来力量大”的教育。
    快、热、乱是新区群运初发动时的特点。领导上应有的态度是不怕动的乱，只怕动不起来；不求动的好，只求动起来。但当局面打开，群众动起来以后，领导上就应掌握部分村庄眼睛向外，为单纯夺取果实而产生的“隔村斗争”现象，及时强调分村斗争，发动本村群众向本村统治者斗争与说理，并加强阶级教育与政策教育，使运动得到深入和提高。
    四、“有缝就钻”、能动就动，及时组织，及时斗争
    新区工作基础较差，运动初期往往是大部群众愿意翻身，但对运动又犹豫观望，不愿先出头行动。少数大胆敢干的贫民则急于要求翻身斗争。这时不能机械运用老区“思想酝酿成熟，等待多数思想自觉后再行动”的经验，这样会拖延时间，不合新区群众迫切要求翻身的规律，也会予敌伪封建势力以组织防御时间和破坏机会，积极分子也会感到压抑，情绪低落下来。正确的领导应该是能动就动，见缝就钻，一方面不放松对少数积极分子“人多力量大”的教育，使其更多的“串连”其他群众，另方面放手让群众行动，用活的斗争材料教育大多数，不断的扩大群众组织，提高群众觉悟。罗屯区大×庄是大汉奸郭昆池的家，有名的“雁过拔毛”的村子，统治势力较强。开头是几个人积极活动，斗争了伪保长——地主郭凤明，当时全村群众都参加了，领导上在胜利后马上总结这个斗争，向大家进行教育，群众情绪极高，他们愿意积极参加今后的斗争，当天农民便扩大了三十多个人。
