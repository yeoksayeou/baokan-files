　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] A spokesman for the Yan'an Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the bombing of Yan'an Headquarters by eight Kuomintang planes (Note by the reporter: the previous report of seven planes was an error, it was eight planes): While representatives of the Kuomintang, the United States, and the Chinese Communist Party are still negotiating for peace, the Kuomintang suddenly dispatched B-24 bombers on the 2nd of this month to bomb our headquarters, and used machine guns to fire approximately 10,000 bullets in the vicinity of our headquarters. The Kuomintang Air Force has bombed and strafed liberated areas countless times in the past six months, causing many deaths and injuries to our peaceful residents and significant losses. Now, they have even bombed and strafed Yan'an, which is an extremely serious and intolerable incident. Our headquarters has now telegraphed the CCP representatives in Nanjing and Beiping to lodge a serious protest, demanding not only an apology and compensation from the Kuomintang side, but also a complete ban on the use of any air force in the civil war. We believe that if the Kuomintang authorities have even a little bit of sincerity for peace and a sense of humanity, they cannot reject our just demands. The US government, standing on the position of mediating the Chinese civil war, should of course support this minimal method of reducing the cruelty of the civil war. Moreover, it should be solemnly pointed out that the planes, bombs, machine guns, machine gun bullets, and gasoline used by the Kuomintang in this bombing and strafing of Yan'an and previous bombings and strafings of various liberated areas were all manufactured and supplied by the United States and the US government. The personnel of the Kuomintang Air Force were also trained by American officers in China and in the United States. The US government, merely to demonstrate the necessary impartial attitude of continuing to participate in mediating the Chinese civil war, merely to express that it does not participate in or support the bombing and strafing of Yan'an and other liberated areas, cannot escape the political and moral responsibility of stopping the Kuomintang from using American air force weapons to massacre the Chinese people.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] Tokyo Dispatch: Yesterday, all Tokyo newspapers published the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast of the news of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang planes bombing Yan'an in prominent positions. "Minpo," the organ of the Japan Socialist Party (edited by Hitoshi Yamakawa), featured the news of the bombing of Yan'an as the lead story, with the headline "The Most Important Stage of the Kuomintang-Communist War." "Miyako Shimbun," which has a wide circulation, also published the news in a similarly prominent position. Minpo also published an editorial stating: The current situation in China may even provoke international joint intervention. The newspaper suggested: First, Chiang Kai-shek must abandon the idea of eliminating the Chinese Communist army within two or three months; second, the Chinese people's anti-civil war movement must be strengthened; and third, foreign public opinion must listen to the opinions of the Chinese people.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] Reuters, New York, 4th: New York Broadcasting announced tonight that Marshall, after receiving the CCP's protest against the bombing of the CCP capital Yan'an, had further discussions with Chiang Kai-shek. Reuters reported: Marshall flew to Guling yesterday to hear a report from CCP representative Zhou Enlai on Friday's bombing of Yan'an and to hold discussions with Chiang Kai-shek. The bombing was reportedly carried out by six American-style aircraft. Zhou Enlai told Marshall that this attack on the Communist "headquarters" signifies that the Chinese civil war has reached a decisive new stage.

　　就蒋机轰炸延安事
    延安总部提出严重抗议
    要求蒋方道歉禁绝空军用于内战美供给蒋介石军火不能逃脱责任
    马歇尔赴牯岭与蒋有所商谈
    【新华社延安五日电】延安总部发言人顷就国民党飞机八架（记者按：本报前称七架系八架之误）轰炸延安总部事发表谈话说：当国民党代表、美国代表和中共代表还在谈判和平的时候，国民党方面忽于本月二日出动Ｂ２４式轰炸机轰炸本总部，并在本总部附近用机枪扫射子弹约一万发。国民党空军，在过去半年内，曾经无数次轰炸扫射解放区，我和平居民死伤损失很多。现在竟又轰炸扫射延安，这实在是极端严重不可容忍的事件。本总部现已电令南京和北平中共代表提出严重抗议，除要求国民党方面道歉赔偿外，并要求完全禁绝在内战中使用任何空军。我们相信，国民党当局如果稍有一点和平诚意和人道观念，就不能拒绝我们的正义要求。美国政府站在调处中国内战的立场上，当然也应当赞助这种减轻内战残酷性的最低办法。而且应当郑重指出，国民党这种轰炸扫射延安和历次轰炸扫射各解放区，所用的飞机、炸弹、机枪、机枪子弹以及汽油，无一不是美国制造和美国政府供给的。国民党空军的人员，也是美国军官在中国和美国所训练的。美国政府仅仅为了表示继续参加调处中国内战的必要公正态度，仅仅为了表示不参加或不赞助对于延安和其他解放区的轰炸扫射，就不能逃脱制止国民党利用美国空军武器屠杀中国人民的政治的和道义的责任。
    【新华社延安四日电】东京讯：昨日东京各日报，一律以显著地位刊载新华社广播蒋介石国民党飞机轰炸延安之消息。日本社会党机关报“民报”（该报总编为山川均）把轰炸延安的消息作为首要新闻，标题为“国共和战的最重要阶段”。销行甚广的“都新闻”，亦以同样显著地位刊载该消息。民报并发表社论称：中国目前的局势，甚至可能促起国际的共同干涉。该报建议：第一，蒋介石必须抛弃在两三个月内消灭中国共产党军队的想法；第二，中国人民反内战运动必须加强；第三，外国舆论必须倾听中国人民的意见。
    【新华社延安五日电】路透社纽约四日电：纽约广播今夜称，马歇尔在收到中共抗议轰炸中共首府延安之抗议书后，又与蒋介石有所商谈。路透社称：马歇尔于昨日飞抵牯岭，以便在听取中共代表周恩来关于星期五轰炸延安之报告，并与蒋介石进行商谈。此次轰炸，据称是由六架美式飞机所进行者。周恩来告马歇尔称：这种打击共产党“首脑”的事件，意味着中国内战已达决定性的新阶段。
