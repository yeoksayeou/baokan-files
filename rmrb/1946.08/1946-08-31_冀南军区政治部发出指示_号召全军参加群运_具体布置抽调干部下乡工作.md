　　Political Department of the Jinnan Military Region Issues Instructions
    Calling on the Entire Army to Participate in Mass Movement
    Specifically Arranging for the Dispatch of Cadres to the Countryside
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Weixian] The Political Department of the Jinnan Military Region recently issued instructions to mobilize and organize the entire army to cooperate with the local authorities in actively supporting and participating in the great peasant emancipation movement. The instructions emphasized that we are the people's army, the sons and daughters of Jinnan, and should give a resounding response to the correct policy of the District Party Committee in boldly mobilizing the masses. We must mobilize and organize the entire army, from top to bottom, to cooperate with the local authorities, actively support and participate in the movement, so that the peasants can be liberated from feudal bondage. To achieve this task, the following work is specifically stipulated: 1. All units should hold various meetings based on their specific circumstances to unify thinking. All comrades, especially leading cadres at all levels, must clearly establish the following concept: heroic combat and helping the people to emancipate themselves are the basic tasks and duties of the people's army. 2. In coordination with the military training plan, organize study, examine thinking, and liquidate confused ideas. Systematically collect concrete and vivid materials from the mass movement, compile them into teaching materials, and educate the troops. Mobilize poor peasant soldiers and cadres who have recently joined the army after experiencing the mass movement to act as instructors, reporting on their own past suffering and emancipation process to educate everyone. 3. In addition to retaining necessary cadres to maintain daily work, all sub-district organs and troops must resolutely dispatch one-half to two-thirds of their cadres to work in the countryside. All field troops must also dispatch cadres to the countryside. 4. Create model movements to help peasants emancipate themselves. 5. Strengthen leadership and correct the view of underestimating mass movement work. The instructions emphasized repeatedly that this peasant emancipation movement is a great revolutionary movement, calling on all comrades in the army to display a high degree of class love, consciously and actively join the movement, actively support and help the peasants emancipate themselves, and improve the essence of our people's army through the movement.
