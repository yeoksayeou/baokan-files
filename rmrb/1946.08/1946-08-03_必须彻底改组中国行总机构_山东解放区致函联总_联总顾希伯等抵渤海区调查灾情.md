　　The China Relief Headquarters Must Be Thoroughly Reorganized
    Shandong Liberated Area Sends Letter to UNRRA
    UNRRA's G. Findlay Davidson and Others Arrive in Bohai Region to Investigate Disaster Situation
    [Linyi, 31st dispatch] The Shandong Liberated Area Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Government, and the Shandong Branch of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee, representing 29 million people in the liberated area, sent a letter to the UNRRA China Office and forwarded it to UNRRA, stating: "We believe that the China Relief Headquarters must be thoroughly reorganized, and representatives of the people from the liberated areas and democratic人士 from all parties should participate in order to achieve fair distribution of materials and effective disaster relief. The proposal made by the CCP representative General Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, the chief person in charge of the relief committee in the liberated areas, that the liberated areas directly send representatives to the UNRRA headquarters in Washington to prevent the Kuomintang's one-party government from engaging in private gain and corruption, is fully supported by us, representing 29 million people in the Shandong Liberated Area. The statement by the Kuomintang government spokesperson that 'the Chinese government's policy of distributing relief supplies is based on need, and the government has absolutely no other considerations' is completely inconsistent with the facts. The vast area north of the Longhai Railway, south of Tianjin, and east of the Jinpu Railway in the Shandong Liberated Area has been devastated by the violent Japanese for eight years. According to incomplete statistics, the losses have reached over 220 million yuan, and more than 30% of the total population is in urgent need of relief. If based on need, this area is the most in need. However, the relief supplies received in the past five months were only 1,300 tons, and the average per person was less than two taels on the market scale. The Kuomintang government and the China Relief Headquarters have repeatedly used transportation difficulties as an excuse. In fact, most areas of the Shandong Liberated Area can use wooden boats, sailing boats, and steamships... (code unclear) The Kuomintang military police stationed in Qingdao surrounded and detained them. In order to facilitate highway transportation, the liberated area mobilized 70,000 people to rush to repair more than 500 li of the Jiao (county) Lin (yi) highway. After the first batch of supplies arrived, more than 10,000 li of highway were repaired one after another. However, due to the Kuomintang authorities withholding gasoline, the highway could not be used, and a large number of relief supplies were transported by car to the areas ruled by the Kuomintang and puppet troops, resulting in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang and puppet troops in Shandong, with a population of less than two million, receiving several times more supplies than the liberated area with a population of 29 million." The letter continued: "The Shandong Liberated Area has always adopted a spirit of cooperation and provided convenience for the transportation of materials. All the meager supplies that have been transported have been completely and directly distributed to those in need, and the relief agencies are very sound. If reasonably allocated relief supplies can be obtained, the relief effect will definitely be brought into play."

　　必须彻底改组中国行总机构
    山东解放区致函联总   
    联总顾希伯等抵渤海区调查灾情
    【临沂三十一日电】山东解放区省参议会，省政府及中国解放区救济委员会山东分会等，代表该解放区二千九百万人民致函联总中国分署并转联总称：“我们认为必须彻底改组中国行总机构，应有解放区人民代表及各方民主人士参加，以求得物资的公平分配与有效的救济灾民，中共代表周恩来将军与解放区善后救济委员会总负责人董必武所提，由解放区直接派遣代表参加华盛顿善后救济总署，以免国民党一党政府营私舞弊的主张，我们代表山东解放区二千九百万人民全力拥护。国民党政府发言人所谓“中国政府分配救济物资之政策，系以需要为基础，政府方面绝无其他之考虑”一说，与事实完全不符。山东解放区陇海路以北，天津以南，津浦路以东，这一广大地区，八年来横遭暴日摧残，所受损失据不完全统计，达二万二千万万元以上，急需救济者占总人口的百分之三十以上，如以需要为基础，则此处需要最为迫切。然过去五个月中所获救济物资，仅一千三百吨，每人平均所得尚不及市秤二两，国民党政府及行总方面一再借口交通困难，事实上山东解放区大部地区均可利用木船，帆船及汽船……（电码不明）驻青之国民党军警包围和扣留。解放区为便利公路运输曾以七万人力赶修胶（县）临（沂）公路五百余华里，在首批物资到达后，先后修补公路一万余华里，然而由于国民党当局扣留汽油，以致公路无法利用，而大批救济物资却以汽车运往国民党及伪军统治地区，结果使不满二百万人口之山东国民党与伪军统治区，反较二千九百万人口的解放区，所得物资超过数倍。”该函继称：“山东解放区始终采取合作精神，对物资运输绝予方便，所有运来之微少物资，均完全直接发挥需要者之手，且救济机构均甚健全，如能得到合理分配的救济物资，定可发挥救济效果。”
