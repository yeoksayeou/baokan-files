　　The Evil Consequences of Bureaucratic Capital Domination
    Sharp Decline in Industrial Production in Tianjin and Beiping

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] Beiping News: The light and heavy industries in the Tianjin and Beiping area, seized by the Song clique's big bureaucratic capital, have very few plants operating, and the output is only half of what it used to be. According to the Economic Ministry's Special Commissioner's Office in mid-May: the ministry has taken over six direct industrial and mining enterprises in Beiping, Tianjin and part of Hebei. Of the 328 factories taken over, only 103 are operating, accounting for about 31 percent of the total. Among them, the ×hua Electric Power Company, one of the so-called eight major companies, including the Beiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu units, originally had a monthly power generation of 137,000 kilowatts, but now it only generates 85,000 kilowatts, only 62 percent of what it used to be. The Tianjin Railway Car Factory can now only produce 500 cars per month, half of the previous monthly output of 1,000 cars.
