    [Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 20th] From 11:00 PM on the 10th of this month to 8:00 PM on the 11th, in the 18 hours of counterattacking the main Kuomintang forces in the area east of Hai'an, a unit of the New Fourth Army recovered more than ten towns including Libao and Xichang, and annihilated the entire New 7th Brigade (formerly the New 7th Division) of the 21st Division (formerly the 21st Army) and most of the 105th Brigade (formerly the 105th Division) of the 49th Division (formerly the 49th Army) (except for one regiment). The results of the battle were as follows: It is estimated that over 3,000 Kuomintang soldiers including Liao Wanli, commander of the 21st Regiment of the New 7th Brigade, were killed or wounded. Over 5,100 officers and soldiers, including Tian Yuncong (from Yunnan, graduate of the Yunnan Military Academy), deputy brigade commander of the New 7th Brigade (formerly deputy division commander) and Jin Ya (formerly chief of staff of the 105th Division, recently transferred to this position), deputy brigade commander of the 105th Brigade, laid down their weapons. A total of 96 cannons of various calibers were seized (including 30 US-made 6cm mortars), 350 light machine guns (including 68 US-made submachine guns, 4 Thompson submachine guns, and 1 Karr submachine gun), 90 grenade launchers, 2,800 rifles and carbines, 4 telephones, 11 telescopes, over 300,000 rounds of various ammunition, and many other military supplies. The above statistics do not include the results of local armed forces. Note: The 105th Brigade was formerly General Zhang Xueliang's guard, later incorporated into the 49th Army by Chiang Kai-shek; the New 7th Brigade's Sichuan troops were all driven to the civil war front as alienated forces.
