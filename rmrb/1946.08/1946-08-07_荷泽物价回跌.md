　　Heze Commodity Prices Fall Back Down
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze] Recently, commodity prices in Heze rose sharply, causing great anxiety among citizens. In the past half-month, the Administration has been determined to stabilize commodity prices, simplify grain purchase certificates, and ban speculative merchants from smuggling and hoarding. Grain prices have now gradually fallen. On July 19th, wheat once rose to 940 yuan per斗 (dǒu), but fell back to 820 yuan on the 27th, and further to 800 yuan on the 29th. Soybeans rose to 640 yuan per 斗 (dǒu), fell back to 600 yuan on the 25th, and further to 540 yuan on the 29th. Millet rose to 700 yuan per 斗 (dǒu), and fell back to 600 yuan on the 29th. On the 23rd, sorghum rose to 400 yuan per 斗 (dǒu), and fell back to 350 yuan on the 29th. Other local products have also fallen without exception, such as cotton, which rose to 520 yuan per斤 (jīn) and fell to 450 yuan. The Director of the Municipal Administration said: The current decline in commodity prices is only the beginning. If we continue to implement Vice Chairman Rong's policy of stabilizing commodity prices, prices will gradually fall in the future.

　　荷泽物价回跌
    【本报荷泽讯】日前荷泽物价高涨，市民极为焦虑。半月来管理局决心平稳物价，统简购粮证，取缔投机商人走私囤积，现粮食价格已逐步下跌。七月十九日：麦子一度每斗涨至九百四十元，二十七日跌回八百二十元，二十九日再跌回八百元。大豆每斗涨至六百四十元，二十五日跌回六百元，二十九日再回五百四十元。小米每斗涨至七百元，二十九日跌回六百元。二十三日高粱每斗涨至四百元，二十九日回跌三百五十元。其他土产货物都无不下跌，如棉花每斤涨至五百二十元跌至四百五十元。本市管理局长谈：目前物价下跌仅为开端，继续贯彻戎副主席平抑物价方针日后将逐步下跌。
