Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th—The Joint Conference of Representatives from Northeast Provinces enthusiastically discussed the Common Governance Program of the democratic governments of Northeast provinces and cities on the 9th, 10th, and 11th. This program was originally proposed by Lin Feng, Lü Zhengfeng, Gao Chongmin, Zhang Xuesi, Che Xiangchen, and others, and co-signed by 146 representatives including Wang Huanwen, Yu Tianfang, and Wan Yi. It was presented to the general assembly on the third day (9th), with detailed explanations by the original proposers Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin. On the fourth day, various delegation held separate deliberations. On the fifth day, a plenary session was convened for discussion.

Prior to the discussion, Mr. Yu Yifu, representing the Proposal Review Committee of the conference, reported on the proposal review process, stating: "All proposals from the representatives of the conference totaled 108, which were consolidated into 55: 9 on politics, 16 on civil affairs, 5 on military affairs, 14 on education, 7 on finance and economics, 1 on transportation, 2 on ethnic affairs, and 1 on the governance program." Subsequently, the conference focused on discussing the governance program.

Representatives spoke enthusiastically, focusing primarily on land, military, cultural and educational affairs, and religious and ethnic minority issues within the program. The land issue sparked the most heated debate, with over 80 representatives speaking. While all representatives agreed on the principle of realizing "land to the tiller," the focus of contention was whether the program should include a clause on "distributing the land of large landlords."

Farmer representative Qiao Chuanyi stated: "Land to the tiller is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. Today, we are distributing the land of traitors, bandits, despots, and reactionaries. To take care of the lives of landlords and their families, those who have not acted as despots will still be allowed to cultivate some land." Other representatives added that in the Northeast, many large landlords were inseparable from traitors and bandits, and their land should be distributed. However, landlords who participated in the War of Resistance against Japan and the democratic movement should be taken care of. Regarding the land issue of Mongolians, some representatives suggested that it should be stipulated in the provincial constitutions of each province based on specific circumstances. Mr. Cha Ansun, Vice-Chairman of the Qiqihar City Council, said: "We must improve the lives of Mongolians and transform nomadic peoples into cultivators, so the land issue of Mongolians should be resolved." However, Mongolian representatives pointed out that in Jilin Province, 170,000 hectares of land were held by 30,000 Mongolians, and Mongolians could not bear to see Han compatriots without land, so a portion could be distributed.

During discussions on religious and ethnic issues, some representatives argued that Koreans who had acquired citizenship should be treated the same as domestic ethnic minorities. Mr. Guan Houyan explained that Koreans had made significant contributions in the War of Resistance against Japan and the democratic struggle, and many Korean compatriots in the Anti-Japanese United Army had fought bravely against Japan for many years.

After three days of detailed discussion, this general guideline for building a new, democratic, and prosperous Northeast was formally adopted with the unanimous support of all representatives.

　　东北各省代表联席会
　  通过民主施政纲领
　　对实现“耕者有其田”曾热烈讨论
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】东北各省代表联席会于九、十、十一三日热烈讨论东北各省市民主政府共同施政纲领。该纲领原由林枫、吕正峰、高崇民、张学思、车向忱等十人提出，王焕文、于天放、万毅等一百四十六位代表联署，于第三日（九日）大会提出，并由原提案人林枫、高崇民详加说明，大会第四日由各代表团分别进行酝酿，第五日即召开全体大会讨论。讨论前，于毅夫氏代表大会提案审查委员会报告提案审查经过称：大会各代表之全部提案共一○八件，经综合归并后共五十五件，计政治九件，民政十六件，军事五件，教育十四件，财经七件，交通一件，民族二件，施政纲领一件。继大会集中力量讨论施政纲领。各代表热烈发言，多集中于纲领中之土地、军事、文教及宗教、少数民族问题。尤以土地问题讨论最为热烈，共有八十几位代表发言，对实现“耕者有其田”的原则，各代表俱无异议，争论之焦点，在于纲领中应否规定“分配大地主土地”一项问题上。农民代表乔传义发言称：“耕者有其田是孙中山先生的主张，我们今天分的是汉奸、土匪、恶霸、反动派的土地，为了照顾地主的生活及其家属，没作恶霸的还留给他一部分土地耕种”。其他代表补充说明东北不少大地主和汉奸、胡子不可分，这些人的土地要分，但对参加抗日和民主运动的地主，应加以照顾。关于蒙民土地问题，一部分代表主张根据特殊情况，由各省的省宪中加以规定。齐齐哈尔市议会副议长查安荪先生说：“我们要提高蒙民生活，要使游牧民族变成耕种者，故蒙民土地问题应当解决”。而蒙民代表则提出吉林省有十七万垧土地在三万蒙人手中，蒙胞不能看着汉胞没土地，所以可以分出一部分。在讨论宗教、民族问题时，一部分代表主张对入籍之韩人，应与国内的少数民族同等看待。关后彦老先生说明韩人在抗日和民主斗争中都有不少功绩，抗联中曾有不少韩胞对日苦战多年。经过三天的详细讨论，这一建设民主繁荣新东北的总指针，在全体代表一致拥护下正式通过。
