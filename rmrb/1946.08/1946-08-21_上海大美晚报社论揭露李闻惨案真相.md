Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Shanghai air dispatch: After the Li-Wen assassination, the English-language Shanghai Da Mei Evening News pointed out in an editorial: "Based on the facts, the following conclusions can be drawn: First, the assassins did use special weapons equipped with silencers; second, these weapons were provided by the US side to the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, which was related to the group led by General Dai Li (referring to the Juntong Bureau)." The newspaper stated: "To promote China into a democratic and law-abiding, rather than an authoritarian, country, it is necessary to promptly eliminate this secret group's self-centered kingdom." Furthermore, according to reports in this newspaper quoting a United Press New York dispatch: The New York Post commented in an editorial on May 20th that the Kuomintang's audacity in attacking Chinese democrats stemmed from the belief that with American aid, the totalitarians could do whatever they wanted, realizing the bold dream of eliminating dissidents and transforming China into a prototype fascist Germany. The newspaper advocated that unless Chiang Kai-shek "immediately ceases using assassination as a political weapon and resolves to eliminate the threat of civil war," the United States should halt Lend-Lease aid to China.

　　上海大美晚报社论揭露李闻惨案真相
    【新华社延安十七日电】上海航讯：李闻惨案发生后，此间英文大美晚报在社论中指出：“根据事实可得出如下的结论：第一，暗杀时凶手确曾使用装有消声设备的特种武器；其次，这种武器是由美方交与中美合作所的，而后者与戴笠将军所领导之团体（按指军统局）有关。”该报称：“欲促使中国成为一民主守法而非集权主义的国家，对此秘密团体唯我独尊之王国，实有迅予肃清的必要。”又据此间报纸刊载合众社纽约讯：纽约邮报五月二十日在社论中评称：国民党甘冒大不韪，对中国民主人士实行攻击，实基于如下之信念，即以为借美国之援助，集权主义者即可为所欲为，实现铲除异己，变中国为雏型法西斯德国之勇敢梦想。该报主张除非蒋介石“立刻停止以暗杀为政治武器，并决意解除内战威胁”，则美国应停止以租借法案援华。
