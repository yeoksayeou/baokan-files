Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: A Tokyo dispatch from the Central News Agency on July 30th stated that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, in response to questions from a Progressive Party member during the House of Representatives budget committee meeting, "expressed gratitude" for Chairman Chiang's magnanimity towards Japanese residents in China after Japan's surrender. He also said, "I am deeply moved by Chairman Chiang's generous statement." According to the Central News Agency, "Yoshida regrets that Japan lacks diplomatic relations to formally thank the Chinese National Government, expresses his apologies, and hopes to find a way to express his gratitude." People in Yan'an feel that Yoshida Shigeru's "gratitude" to Chiang Kai-shek is not without reason. In his speech on August 15th last year, Chiang Kai-shek declared that "we must love our enemies" and "not dwell on past grievances." Under this policy, in addition to incorporating Japanese puppet troops and condoning the top war criminal Yasuji Okamura's residence in Nanjing without trial, the Chiang Kai-shek government, under MacArthur's direction, also sold out China's rights, such as allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish along the Chinese coast, damaging China's fishing industry and infringing on China's territorial waters.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Tokyo dispatch: The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers notified the Japanese government on the 29th of last month that the Supreme Commander did not oppose the Japanese government's plan to collect taxes from non-Japanese residents in Japan, except for personnel of the occupation forces and the Supreme Commander's headquarters. Note: This statement by the Allied Headquarters is in response to the fact that Japanese police shot Taiwanese people for not being able to pay the high taxes stipulated by the Japanese side. Japanese financial cliques then instructed the police to forcibly evict them from their stalls.

　　蒋介石有辱国体
    吉田茂对蒋宽容战犯，表示“感激”！
    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社七月三十日东京专电称：日首相吉田茂在众院预算会上答复进步党议员质问时，对蒋主席在日本投降后加诸在华日侨之宽大为怀，“表示感激”。并称：“蒋主席之宽大声明，本人极为感动”。据中央社称：“吉田惜日本外交关系现尚缺乏，无法向中国国民政府申谢，表示歉意，希望设法致谢”。延安人士咸感吉田茂对蒋介石之“感激”，不是没有原因的。蒋介石在去年八月十五日演讲中，即曾宣称“要爱敌人”，要“不念旧恶”，在这一方针之下，除了收编日伪军，纵容头号战犯冈村＠次安居南京迟迟不加审判外，蒋介石政府还在麦克阿瑟指使之下，出卖中国的权利，例如议日本渔船在中国沿海捉鱼，损害了中国的渔业，侵犯了中国的领海主权。
    【新华社延安一日电】东京讯：盟军最高统帅部上月二十九日通知日本政府，该统帅部不反对日政府征收日本境内非日本侨民赋税的计划，但占领军与该统帅部的人员例外。按：盟军总部此一声明，系针对日警枪杀台人因无钱缴纳日方规定的高度赋税，日财阀即指使警察以暴力驱逐出搭火摊之地。
