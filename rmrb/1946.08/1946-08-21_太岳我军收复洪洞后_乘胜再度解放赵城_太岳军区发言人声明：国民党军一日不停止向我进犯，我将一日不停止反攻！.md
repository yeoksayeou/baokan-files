　　After Recovering Hongdong, Our Taiyue Army
　  Seizes the Opportunity to Liberate Zhaocheng Again
　  Spokesperson for the Taiyue Military Region Declares: If the Kuomintang Army Does Not Stop Invading Us for Even One Day, We Will Not Stop Counterattacking for Even One Day!
　　[Urgent Telegram from Yangcheng, This Newspaper, 19th] After the Taiyue Eighth Route Army recovered Hongdong City, at 3:00 AM on the 18th, they seized the opportunity to liberate Zhaocheng again. The fierce battle began at 12:00 PM on the 14th, first clearing out peripheral strongholds such as Motou Station and Sunbao. Then, on the 16th and 17th, they besieged the county seat and Chengguan. More than 1,000 soldiers from Yan Xishan's 69th Division in Huoxian rushed to reinforce from the west of the river on the 17th. At that time, our army was encircling and annihilating and blocking the Yan army in the city. The 69th Division was terrified upon hearing the news and retreated rapidly to the west. Zhaocheng was then restored to us at 3:00 AM. More than 700 people were captured alive, and the seizure of mountain guns (2), mortars (3), and rifles and machine guns is still being verified. Zhaocheng was originally liberated by our army from the Japanese invaders on November 3rd of last year, but was forcibly occupied by the 73rd Division of Yan Xishan's 34th Army on the 22nd. Since the city was occupied by the Yan army, they imposed exorbitant taxes, raped, plundered, and returned the people to the bitter sea. When our army liberated the city, the masses warmly welcomed us, cheering along the streets, celebrating the liberation.
　　[Telegram from Yangcheng, This Newspaper, 18th] The spokesperson of the Taiyue Military Region recently issued a solemn statement regarding the Taiyue Eighth Route Army eliminating Yan-puppet strongholds in the Hongdong and Zhaocheng areas, cutting off the transportation routes of the Chiang-Yan reactionaries, and preventing the expansion of the civil war, stating: Chiang Kai-shek is mobilizing large armies to continuously enter southern Shanxi, openly refusing the investigation and mediation of the Linfen Executive Group, and his intention to expand the civil war has long been exposed. At present, the Chiang army that has entered the southern Shanxi civil war front has reached eight divisions. Starting from the 13th of this month, they have begun to invade us again. More than 100 villages in the Wenxi and Xiaxian liberated areas have now been invaded again, and they are now attacking Dongzhen, the important town northeast of Wenxi. At the same time, the Yan army along the Tongpu Railway is also intensifying its invasion. The Shanxi Yan army also reassembled its forces last month, coordinating with the Chiang army to attack us from the north and south. In the first half of the month, it dispatched more than 10,000 troops to successively invade and ravage more than 100 villages in the liberated areas of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Huoxian counties. On the 13th of this month, the entire 69th Division was dispatched in an attempt to wipe out our garrison in Huoxian in one fell swoop, and prepared to gradually compress us from north to south from Huoxian to Zhaocheng to Hongdong, occupying all the liberated areas along the Tongpu Railway, in order to open up the line from Linfen to Wenxi and further expand the civil war. Now our army has no way to retreat and cannot bear it any longer, and is forced to launch a counter-offensive, eliminating Yan-puppet strongholds in the Hongdong and Zhaocheng areas and cutting off their transportation routes to prevent them from continuing to reinforce their invasion. We solemnly declare: If the Kuomintang army does not stop invading us for even one day, we will not stop counterattacking for even one day! We must give the warmongers a double blow in order to smash the reactionaries' conspiracy and prevent the expansion of the civil war.

　　太岳我军收复洪洞后
　  乘胜再度解放赵城
　  太岳军区发言人声明：国民党军一日不停止向我进犯，我将一日不停止反攻！
    【本报阳城十九日急电】太岳八路军，于收复洪洞城后，十八日晨三时乘胜再度解放赵城。激战于十四日夜十二时开始，首先扫清磨头车站、孙堡等外围据点，继于十六、十七两日围攻县城及城关，霍县阎军六十九师千余人，即于十七日绕道河西赶来增援，当时我军正于城外围歼、堵击城内阎军，六十九师闻风丧胆向西急退，赵城遂于三时为我恢复。生俘七百余人，缴获山炮二门，迫击炮三门，步机枪正清查中。赵城原为我军去年十一月三日从日寇手中解放，二十二日即被阎军三十四军七十三师强占。该城自被阎军侵占后，横征暴敛，奸淫抢掠，重陷苦海。我军光复该城时，群众热烈欢迎，夹道欢呼，庆幸解放。
    【本报阳城十八日电】太岳军区发言人，顷就太岳八路军在洪、赵地区扫除阎伪据点，斩断蒋阎反动派运兵路线。制止内战扩大，发表严正声明称：蒋介石正调动大军源源开入晋南，公开拒绝临汾执行小组调查与调处，蓄意扩大内战，早已昭然若揭。目前进入晋南内战前线之蒋军，已达八师之众，本月十三日起，已开始向我再度进犯，闻、夏解放区百余村，刻已被再度侵占，现更向我闻喜东北之重镇——东镇进攻；同蒲沿线阎军之进犯，亦同时更加猖狂，山西阎军亦于上月重新集结兵力，配合蒋军向我南北夹击，上半月出动兵力万余，先后进犯蹂躏我平（遥）介（休）灵（石）霍（县）各县解放区百余村庄。本月十三日更以六十九师全部出犯，企图一举消灭我霍县驻军，并准备由霍县而赵城而洪洞，向我逐步压缩，由北向南，将占我同蒲沿线全部解放区，以打通临汾至闻喜一线，进一步扩大内战。现我军退无可退，忍无可忍，被迫进行反攻，在洪、赵地区扫除阎伪据点，断其运兵路线，以阻止其继续增援进犯。我们严正声明：国民党军一日不停止向我进犯，我将一日不停止反攻！必须给好战者以加倍的打击，方能粉碎反动派之阴谋，制止内战扩大。
