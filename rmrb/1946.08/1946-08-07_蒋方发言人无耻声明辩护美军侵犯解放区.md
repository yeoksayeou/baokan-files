　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Jiang's spokesman, Cai Wenzhi, issued a statement defending the illegal actions of the US Marines in encroaching on the Liberated Areas. Regarding the incident on July 13th, where seven US Marines stationed in Liushouying trespassed into the Changli Liberated Area and were disarmed by the militia, the US representative, Yu Ting, dispatched to Changli for investigation, had already admitted the US soldiers' mistake of opening fire and provoking the incident, violating Chinese sovereignty, and guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again. However, Cai Wenzhi, disregarding the facts, still tried his best to defend the US side. Cai Wenzhi also claimed that the US military's presence in China was the same as the Chinese army's entry into Vietnam. Jiang's government spokesman is actually willing to abandon the hard-earned status of the Big Four that the Chinese people obtained, reducing China to the status of Vietnam, which has not yet gained independence.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Since the incident of US Marines and Jiang's army jointly invading the Anpingzhen Eighth Route Army defense area in eastern Hebei occurred, the CCP side immediately requested the Beiping Executive Headquarters to send a special team to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth. However, for a week now, due to the delay by the Jiang side and the US side, the special team has not been able to depart. According to reliable sources, the Jiang side is planning to use the excuse of protecting the Pingjin Highway (note that this highway passes through our Liberated Area) to invade Xianghe and Baodi, which are under the control of the Eighth Route Army. Neutral observers in Pingjin believe that the Jiang side's delay in dispatching a special team for investigation is because the truth of the incident is not conducive to the Jiang side's rumor-mongering propaganda, and even more unfavorable to the Jiang side's conspiracy to invade Baodi and Xianghe.

　　蒋方发言人无耻声明辩护美军侵犯解放区
    【新华社延安四日电】蒋方发言人蔡文治发表声明，为美海军陆战队侵犯解放区的不法行为辩护。七月十三日驻留守营美海军陆战队七人闯入昌黎解放区被民兵解除武装一事，美方派赴昌黎调查之代表于亭早已承认美兵开枪启衅侵犯中国主权的错误，并保证以后不发生类似事件，而蔡文治竟不顾事实仍竟尽力为美方辩护。蔡文治并称：美军驻华与中国军队进驻越南之事相同。蒋政府发言人竟然甘于抛弃中国人民辛苦得来的四强地位，使中国降至尚未获得独立的越南的地位。
    【新华社延安四日电】自美海军陆战队与蒋军并肩进犯冀东安平镇八路军防地的事件发生后，中共方面即要求北平执行部派遣特别小组至出事地点调查真相，但迄今一周，由于蒋方与美方之拖延，特别小组迟迟未能出发。据可靠消息：蒋方正拟借口保护平津公路（按此公路经过我解放区），进犯八路军控制下的香河、宝坻。平津中立的观察家认为蒋方对派特别小组调查采取拖延，乃由于事件真相不利于蒋方的造谣宣传，更不利于蒋方进犯宝坻、香河的阴谋。
