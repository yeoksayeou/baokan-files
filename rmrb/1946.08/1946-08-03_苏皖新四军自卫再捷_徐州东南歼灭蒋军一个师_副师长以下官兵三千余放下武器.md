　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 31st—The Suwan New Fourth Army, in a self-defense battle in the area southeast of Xuzhou on the northern front on the 27th, annihilated an entire division of the Chiang Army's 99th Corps and part of another division. This is the third victory after annihilating more than 20,000 Chiang Army soldiers in the Taixing and Rugao areas on the southern front. The Chiang Army's 99th Corps, advancing from Jiagou Station on the Jinpu Railway, 80 miles south of Xuzhou, eastward to the Huaibei Liberated Area, continued to invade Yugou and Chaoyangji (both more than 100 miles east of Jiagou) on the 24th, and continued to attack eastward, attempting to coordinate with the Chiang Army attacking southeast of Xuzhou to jointly attack Juining. The New Fourth Army launched a counterattack on the 26th. After fierce fighting until the afternoon of the 27th, it had completely resolved the 92nd Division of the invading army at Yugou. Except for more than 500 people who made futile sacrifices, more than 3,000 officers and soldiers below the deputy division commander, Shen Shengkai, all laid down their weapons. The 60th Division of the same corps, which invaded Chaoyangji, was also partially annihilated by the New Fourth Army, and the remnants fled back to Shuanggou Town under the cover of Chiang's aircraft. At this point, Yugou and Chaoyangji were restored. In this battle, six mountain guns, two rocket launchers, one anti-tank gun, and other spoils of war were seized and are currently being inventoried. This corps is a direct line unit of Chiang Kai-shek, fully equipped with American weaponry. It was originally stationed in the Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin areas south of the Yangtze River, and was transferred to the Suxian Jiagou line on the Jinpu Railway around the 10th of this month to participate in the attack on the Suwan Liberated Area.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 31st—Chen Cheng, accompanied by six staff members, flew from Nanjing to Nantong on the 20th and convened a joint meeting of the Party, government, and military to reiterate the Kuomintang reactionaries' "determination to fully implement the bandit suppression plan in central and northern Jiangsu" and to boost the morale of the defeated Chiang Army. After Chen Cheng left, Tang Enbo also went to Nantong to direct the offensive. Bai Chongxi, under the pretext of "inspecting special forces," personally went to Xuzhou on the 24th to supervise the battle for four days, and returned to Nanjing on the evening of the 27th.

    【新华社淮阴卅一日电】苏皖新四军，二十七日在北线徐州东南地区自卫战中，歼灭蒋军九十九军一个师全部与另一师一部分，这是继南线泰兴、如皋地区歼灭蒋军二万余人后的第三次胜利。由徐州南八十里津浦路上夹沟车站东犯淮北解放区之蒋军第九十九军，二十四日续又侵占渔沟、朝阳集（均在夹沟东百余里）等地，并继续向东进攻，企图配合徐州东南犯之蒋军，合击雎宁。新四军于二十六日进行反击，激战至二十七日下午，已将侵占渔沟之该军九十二师全部解决，该部除五百余人作无谓牺牲外，副师长沈盛楷以下官兵三千余人全部放下武器。另侵占朝阳集之该军六十师，亦被新四军歼灭其一部，其残部在蒋机掩护下窜回双沟镇。至此，渔沟、朝阳集两地即告恢复。是役计缴获山炮六门、火箭炮二门、战车防御炮一门、其他战利品正清查中。按该军为蒋介石嫡系部队，全部美械装备，原驻江南无锡、镇江、江阴一带，于本月十日左右调来津浦路宿县夹沟一线，参加进攻苏皖解放区。
    【新华社淮阴三十一日电】陈诚偕随员等一行六人，于二十日由宁飞抵南通，召集党政军联席会议，重申国民党反动派“决心全力贯彻苏中苏北剿匪计划”，并为受挫之蒋军打气。继陈诚去后，汤恩伯亦至南通指挥进攻。白崇禧借“检阅特种部队”为名，二十四日亲至徐州督战四天，于二十七日晚返宁。
