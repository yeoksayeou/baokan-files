(Dispatch from Changzhi by this Newspaper on the 25th) Jiao Zuodian: On the afternoon of the 19th, twelve Chiang Kai-shek planes flying from Nanjing were forced to land in the Yubei area due to exhausted fuel and weather conditions. Two of them fell into the liberated area, one crashed 30 li south of Jiao City, and the other crashed near Qinyang City. The fuselages were damaged to varying degrees. One of the pilots was injured and has been sent to our hospital for treatment. The whereabouts of the other ten planes are unknown. Two landed near the Chiang Kai-shek army stronghold of Potou on the bank of the Yellow River in Meng County, three landed on the Yellow River滩 (beach/shoal), and one crashed into the Yellow River. It is said that this aircraft group belongs to the 42nd Squadron of the 11th Air Force and has been transporting civil war munitions to various places for the past six months. This time, they flew from Nanjing to Xinxiang with the mission of transporting a large amount of gasoline from Xinxiang to Xi'an. The planes were American-made, each equipped with four machine guns and a radio station.
