Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. Mr. Li Furen, one of the persons in charge of the China Democratic League Northwest Headquarters, recently cabled Mr. Luo Longji of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, recounting his ordeal and escape. The original cable is as follows:

To Mr. Luo Longji of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, and forwarded to the Standing Committee of the League:

　　On May 1st, I was kidnapped and assassinated by special agents in Xianyang. On July 17th, I escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an. The details are as follows:

　　At about 9 a.m. on May 1st, I was returning from visiting a friend at the Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Daily. I was walking along the South Courtyard towards my residence at the People's Education Center. On the way, I reached the entrance of the Provincial Library (located at a narrow intersection), where I saw three large sedans parked on the left side (facing south) with their doors open. Suddenly, four special agents rushed out, seized me from both sides, and forced me into a car. Inside the car, there were already four special agents (a driver, a commander of the kidnapping who sat next to the driver, and two others who took over). The two agents who took over pulled out a blood-stained towel from inside the car, blindfolded me, and tightened a leather belt around my throat. Then, they turned me to face the back of the car, pressed my head against the sofa, and held me down in the middle of the seat. The two agents who took over sat on either side. The car then sped away. After forty minutes, the car broke down and stopped. One of the agents said angrily, "Damn it! Call for another one." After several minutes of repair, it continued driving. About half an hour later, it stopped again beside a transportation ditch. Three agents dragged me out of the car, held me up from both sides, and one agent followed with a gun. They dragged me into the transportation ditch. At this time, the agents bound my hands behind my back, contorting my body into a stooped, arched shape. Suddenly, I heard the click of a gun being cocked. The first shot grazed my head, and then the second shot entered my back. I immediately fainted. When I woke up from the coma, I used my left hand to pull off the blindfold and realized that I was on the land of my familiar hometown of Xianyang. The place was a transportation ditch, eight feet deep, extending from Xingping to Dali, built during the War of Resistance. A moment later, a farmer called his son for dinner and discovered someone knocked down in the ditch. He went to the village to call for people, who came and asked me who I was and why I was in this situation. I immediately told them the truth. At this moment, the weather suddenly changed, and a storm began. The farmer reported to my family while helping me out of the ditch and carrying me home. I then learned that the assassination site was Sujiazhuang, located fifteen miles northwest of Xianyang City, near the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. During the transport, Xianyang County government officials and gentry rushed to express their condolences, some with tears of indignation. After being carried home, farmers came to visit incessantly. The next day, four special agents rode bicycles from Xianyang to search the village. Fortunately, with the protection of the farmers, I escaped their grasp. From then on, special agents searched everywhere. Thanks to the farmers' protection, not a word leaked out. Every time I moved, they secretly guarded me during the day and patrolled with guns at night. Therefore, despite the special agents' best efforts in their repeated "encirclements," they were ultimately unable to find me. However, after more than a month of wandering, it was the farmers who took care of me, treated my wounds, and provided medical care. The medicine and techniques used were rudimentary, and the bullet was never removed. The Kuomintang special agents still refused to let go and intensified their search. The people, fearing that I would fall into the hands of the enemy again, insisted on sending me to the safe Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for refuge. With my consent, they took a roundabout route through seven counties before finally arriving. Initially, because the bullet was lodged in my head, I was in constant pain. Fortunately, the local hospital of the Chinese Communist Party performed an operation to remove the bullet. After a short period of recovery, my health has been restored to a preliminary state. Knowing your concern, I am reporting this via cable. I am deeply grateful for your serious protest to the government authorities regarding my assassination. I can now list four points to prove who the perpetrators were: (1) Before my assassination on May 1st, the special agent terror had already permeated Xi'an. On March 1st, the Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Daily was burned down by special agents, who then beat the newspaper vendors, tore up newspapers, and set fire to the newspaper office a total of three times. The famous lawyer Mr. Wang Ren, who righteously served as the legal advisor to the newspaper, was arrested by the Xi'an authorities on April 23rd on the charge of being a smoker and was illegally executed. Six days before my assassination, the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters' Investigation and Statistics Office sent someone to warn the publisher of the "People's Guide," proving that my assassination was part of a series of planned and purposeful acts of violence by the authorities across the country to suppress and assassinate news professionals after the Political Consultative Conference (such as the tragic death of Mr. Yang Zao in a Hangzhou prison and the secret murder of Mr. Sun Pingtian in Nantong). (2) May 1st was the second day of Chairman Chiang's visit to Xi'an. The city was decorated with national flags, and the military police were everywhere. Under such heavily guarded conditions, who would dare to openly kill and set fire except the Kuomintang special agents themselves? I was forced into a car at the entrance of the Provincial Library, and the car openly displayed the words "Vehicle of the Xi'an Municipal Government." Who else would be so reckless? (3) After I was shot but not killed and rescued by the local farmers, four special agents rushed from Xianyang the next morning, carrying business cards from the "Central Military Academy Special Agent Training Class," and searched the village everywhere. Local farmers can testify to this. (4) On May 1st, at Sujiazhuang, fifteen miles northwest of Xianyang City, special agents shot me. The bullet entered the right side of the fifth thoracic vertebra in my back, passed through my chest, and lodged between the right-side carotid artery and jugular vein. The vertebra was damaged, and there is a .38 caliber revolver bullet as evidence. The above four points of evidence conclusively prove that the Xi'an Kuomintang authorities were responsible, leaving no room for denial. I hope the League will protest vigorously based on these facts, send personnel to cooperate with all parties to continue investigating the truth, and have the authorities cooperate with legal experts from various parties to participate in the trial of the main culprits and instigators of the massacre to uphold justice. I also hope that you will vehemently appeal to the authorities and call on democratic people across the country to rise up and stop special agent terror! With respect, and wishing you well! Li Furen, July 29th.

　　李敷仁致电罗隆基陈述被难脱险经过
    【新华社延安三十一日电】民盟西北总支部负责之一的李敷仁先生，顷致电南京中国民主同盟罗隆基先生，陈述被难脱险经过，原电如下：
    南京中国民主同盟罗隆基先生，并转本盟中常会钧鉴：
    我于五月一日被特务绑架暗杀于咸阳，七月十七日脱险抵延，其经过详情如下：
    五月一日上午九时许，我从秦风工商日报馆访友归来，路经南院，徒步行到民众教育馆寓所，途中走至省立图书馆门首（地处狭路口），即见三辆大卧车停驻在那里左侧（向南），车门敞开，突遇特务四名，蜂踊袭来，将我左右架起，投入汽车，车内早有特务四名（一司机、一指挥绑架者，并座于司机旁，另两名接手），由两名特务接手从车箱内抽出一块染满血迹的毛巾，将我两眼蒙住，并用一条皮带绑紧勒到咽喉，然后将我背向车头，头抵沙发，按纳于车箱座垫中间，接手的两名特务分座两侧，汽车即疾驶而去，四十分钟后，汽车发生故障，停驶下来，一特务气愤的说：“妈的！打电话另叫一部来。”经过数分钟的修理，又继续驶行，约半点钟，复停驻于一交通沟旁，三个特务将我拖出汽车，左右架起，一名持枪随后，拖至交通沟内。此时特务将我绑架，两手抄于背后，体成伛偻弓形，忽闻枪机扳动，第一枪从头际擦过，接着第二枪从背脊射入，当即昏倒，等到从昏迷中苏醒，我用左手揭开蒙眼的毛巾一看，方知我在地形如此熟悉的家乡咸阳的土地上。该处系一交通沟，纵深八尺，自兴平迄大荔，为抗战中所筑。片刻，一农民唤其子吃饭，发现濠沟内有一人被击倒，即到村内呼人，来此问我系何人，因何事如此，我当即以实相告。此时突然天变，风雨大作，农民一边向我家里报信，一边将我扶上沟濠，抬送家中，我始知被暗杀地为苏家庄，位于咸阳城西北十五里处，当西兰公路近旁。在抬送途中，咸阳县府职员及士绅纷纷奔来慰问，有感愤落泪者。既抬送家中，农民纷纷探视，一夜人群来往无间断。翌日从咸阳骑脚踏车赶来四名特务，至村中搜捕，幸赖农民掩护，躲过虎口。从此特务到处搜捕，赖农民保护，不让走露一丝风声，每移一地，他们就为我白天暗中放哨，夜晚持枪守卫，因此使特务们费尽心机，层层“围剿”，终于不能发现。但流亡月余，护痛养伤看护医治者为农民，敷药施术者系土法，弹终未取出；而国民党特务依然毫不松手，且搜捕日严，老百姓怕我再落虎口，定要送入到安全的陕甘宁边区来避难，经我同意，始绕经七县，辗转抵达。初因弹藏头部，时时作痛，幸蒙中共地方医院施行手术，将弹取出，经过短期疗养，健康已算初步恢复。知关锦注，特电奉告！诸公为我被杀事，向政府当局提严重抗议，深为感荷！今敷仁可列举证明四点，以证明行凶者究系何人：（一）在五月一日敷仁被暗杀之前，特务恐怖早已弥漫西安，三月一日秦风工商日报被特务焚毁，旋殴打该报报贩，撕毁报纸，并纵火焚烧该报社先后达三次。名律师王任先生，仗义担任该报法律顾问，竟于四月二十三日被西安当局以烟犯为名捕去，非法枪决。在我被暗杀前六日，国民党陕西省党部调统室曾派人当面警告过“民众导报”发行人，这证明我之被杀，是政协会后当局在全国压制与暗杀新闻从业员（羊枣先生之惨死于杭州狱中，孙平天先生之被暗害于南通等）之一连串有计划和有目的的行凶。（二）五月一日适值蒋主席莅临西安之第二天，全市遍悬国旗，军警林立，在此戒备森严的情况下，试问除了国民党特务自己外，谁敢公开杀人放火？我到省立图书馆门首被架上汽车，该车内公开贴有“西安市政府用车”字样，试问这又是谁在横行无忌呢？（三）我被枪杀未死，得当地农民救护后，翌晨早饭时即有四名特务从咸阳赶来，手持“中央军校特务训练班”名片，在村内到处搜捕，有当地农民为证。（四）五月一日，在咸阳城西北十五里处苏家庄，特务将我枪杀，弹从背部脊椎第五胸椎右侧射入，通胸部后留于颈部右侧动静脉之间，现该脊椎被击损折，并有二号左轮手枪枪弹为证。以上四点证据确凿为西安国民党当局所为，无可抵赖，望本盟据理抗议，派员协同各方续查真象，由当局协同各党派法律专家参加惨案正凶及主使者之审判，以彰公论。并望痛陈当局，呼吁全国民主人士，奋起制止特务恐怖为荷！肃此，并颂时祺！李敷仁，七月二十九日。
