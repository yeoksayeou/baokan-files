The Taihang District Party Committee Issues Emergency Notice
Calling on the Entire District to Immediately Prepare for Self-Defense
[This Dispatch from Our Changzhi Bureau, August 25th] After receiving the Central Bureau's emergency call to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic war, the Taihang District Party Committee immediately held a special discussion. On the 17th, it issued an emergency notice stating: All levels of organizations throughout the district, upon receiving this notice, should immediately convene meetings to discuss the Central Bureau's August 15th call and the August 17th *Liberation Daily* editorial. First, they must be ideologically mobilized and universally launch a patriotic movement against the sale of the country and the civil war. It must be ideologically clear that the American imperialist elements are unreasonably aiding Chiang, and Chiang Kai-shek is shamelessly selling out the country, colluding with each other to undermine China's independence, democracy, and peace, and launching a reactionary civil war. In contrast, we are opposing treason and aggression, defending democracy, and protecting the justness of the fruits of the people's democratic victory. The fruits of the War of Resistance are the result of our own bloodshed, sacrifice, and hard struggle, and we must never allow Chiang Kai-shek, that bandit leader, to rob them and sell them to the United States in exchange for his dictatorial rule, allowing imperialism and compradors to put a new yoke around our necks. The historical mission of restoring peace and realizing independence and democracy is the unshirkable responsibility of the Party, government, army, and people of the liberated areas. The people of the whole country place their hope in us. We must smash Chiang Kai-shek's civil war plan. Chiang Kai-shek is selfish and selling out the country, losing popular support and becoming isolated, appearing strong but inwardly weak, corrupt, and incompetent. Although he has American aid, he is bound to fail. The Party, government, army, and people of the liberated areas are defending the interests of national independence and democracy, which is a matter of course, gaining widespread support, solidifying unity, and ensuring victory with righteous indignation. Expose decadence and point out progress and development. Use the comparison of the two forces to illustrate the inevitable prospect of victory. However, it must be pointed out that victory will not come naturally; victory depends on a confident struggle. Therefore, comrades on all fronts must be careful and prudent, avoid arrogance and rashness, and guarantee victory.

In order to victoriously strike the traitorous Chiang army, strategic advances and retreats, and temporary gains and losses of a city or a place are inevitable and there is no need to panic. After the main force retreats, a guerrilla movement must be launched to attack and harass the Chiang army. All localities must make ideological and organizational preparations.

The Party, government, army, and people should be mobilized to immediately prepare for self-defense and resistance. Everything is for enriching and supporting the victory of the front line. Launch a new patriotic heroism movement on all fronts. All localities should immediately and conscientiously implement this notice upon receiving it.

[Another Dispatch] The Taihang District Party Committee, Military Region, and other organs held a mobilization meeting for cadres on the morning of the 24th at the Military Region's residence to prepare for the patriotic self-defense war to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Comrade Li Xuefeng of the District Party Committee gave a report, pointing out that since Chiang Kai-shek's ascent to Lushan and the issuance of the Marshall joint statement, the situation of fighting while negotiating has turned into a full-scale civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek. Only with the victory of the self-defense war can peace be restored, and democracy and independence be guaranteed. He then analyzed the difficulties and weaknesses of the Chiang side in carrying out the civil war, and the basis for the inevitable victory of self-defense. He pointed out that during the negotiation period of the past month, we won the sympathy of the people of the whole country, especially the middle class, so that the people of the whole country can recognize the national character of today's self-defense war and place the country's independence, democracy, and peace on our self-defense victory. At the same time, we also gained time to further consolidate the liberated areas, reorganize the troops, and improve combat effectiveness. Comrade Xuefeng called on all cadres to mobilize and urgently devote themselves to the righteous self-defense war. Everything is for the front line, everything is for the victory of self-defense. Respond to the Central Bureau's emergency call, overcome all individualism, complacency, hedonism, and feelings of disappointment with the current situation. Promote new heroism, unite comrades, unite and educate the masses, pool our wisdom and efforts, and strive for victory. He also called for cherishing the people's strength, economizing on resources, and taking a long-term view to support the war. On the same day, the Administrative Office also conducted cadre mobilization, with Director Li Yiqing giving a report. The next day, cadres of various organs launched discussions and will carry out extensive publicity to the masses in the vicinity of their residences on September 2nd.

　　太行区党委发出紧急通知
    号召全区立即准备自卫
    【本报长治二十五电】中共太行区党委接到中央局粉碎蒋介石进攻、争取爱国战争胜利的紧急号召后，立即作了专门的讨论，并于十七日发出紧急通知称：全区各级组织于接本通知后，应立即召开会议讨论中央局八月十五日号召及八月十七日解放报社论，首先从思想上动员起来，普遍展开反对卖国内战的爱国主义运动。思想上必须明确美帝国主义分子无理地援蒋，蒋介石无耻的卖国，狼狈为奸，破坏中国独立、民主、和平，发动内战的反动性，和我们反对卖国侵略、保卫民主、解放人民民主胜利果实的正义性。抗战果实是我们自己流血牺牲艰苦奋斗得来的，绝不能任彼蒋介石贼头子抢劫去卖给美国，换取他的独裁统治，让帝国主义与买办给我们颈上再套一付新的枷锁。恢复和平，实现独立民主的历史任务，是我们解放区党政军民义不容辞的重担，全国人民都把这希望寄于我们。我们必须粉碎蒋介石的内战计划，蒋介石自私卖国，失道寡助，众叛亲离，外强中干，腐烂无能，虽有美助必败；解放区党政军民维护民族国家独立民主利益，天经地义，得道多助，各界响应，团结坚实，哀兵必胜。揭发没落腐朽，指出进步发展，用两种力量的对比说明胜利的必然前途，然又必须指出胜利不会自然到来，胜利依靠于有把握的斗争。因此各个战线的同志必须小心谨慎，力戒骄傲轻率，保证胜利。
    为了胜利的打击卖国的蒋军，战略战术上的进退，一城一地暂时得失必不可免，无须惊慌，必须在主力撤退之后，展开游击运动，给蒋军以袭击困扰，各地须作思想上组织上的准备。
    党政军民全体动员起来，立即准备自卫应战。一切为着充实支援前线胜利而斗争，展开各个战线上的爱国新英雄主义运动。各地接到通知立即认真执行。
    【又讯】太行区党委、军区等机关干部为粉碎蒋介石进攻准备爱国自卫战争的动员大会，已于二十四日上午在军区驻地举行，由区党委李雪峰同志报告，指出自蒋介石上庐山、马司联合声明后，一面打一面谈的局面已变成蒋介石发动的全面内战，必须有自卫战的胜利，和平才能恢复，民主独立才有保障。继即分析蒋方进行内战的困难与弱点，和自卫的必胜根据，并指出一月以来的谈判期间，我们争取了全国人民特别中间人士的同情，使全国人民能够认识今天自卫战争的民族性，而把国家的独立民主和平寄托于我们的自卫胜利上，同时还争取了时间，进一步巩固了解放区，整训了部队，提高了战斗力。雪峰同志号召一切干部动员起来，紧急投入正义的自卫战，一切为了前线，一切为了自卫的胜利，响应中央局的紧急号召，克服一切个人主义、麻痹享乐以及对时局的失望情绪；发扬新英雄主义，团结同志，团结与教育群众，群策群力，争取胜利。并号召爱护民力，节约资财，长期着眼，以支持战争。同日行署机关亦进行干部动员，由李主任一清报告。次日各机关干部已展开讨论，并将于九月二日由各机关在驻地附近向群众作广泛宣传。
