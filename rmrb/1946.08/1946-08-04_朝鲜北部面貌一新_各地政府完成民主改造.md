　　Northern Korea Presents a New Look
    Local Governments Complete Democratic Transformation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Moscow Radio today broadcast: TASS reporter reports from Pyongyang: Northern Korea has taken on a completely new look. In a short period after the liberation from Japanese oppression, local governments in Northern Korea were transformed into democratic governments and many democratic social organizations were established. There are now more than thirty kinds of democratic newspapers. Northern Korea has trade unions in various industries. In Pyongyang alone, there are eighteen central trade union committees, and the "Workers' Newspaper" is published. Workers have the freedom to express their opinions in the newspaper. The political line of the trade unions completely supports the decision of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on Korea. They are fighting for the establishment of a democratic and independent Korea so that the democracy of Northern Korea can be extended to all parts of Korea. The trade unions have carried out tremendous mass work, publicizing the resolution of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on the Korean issue and exposing the activities of reactionaries such as Kim Koo. The trade unions have also participated in building new industries and eliminating illiteracy. The participation of trade unions in the democratization of Korea has won the support of the broad masses.
