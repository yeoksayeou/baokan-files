Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 29th: Fujian's cultural relics survey work achieved a bumper harvest last year. From April to the end of last year, Fujian's cultural relics survey team conducted surveys in forty-three counties, discovering hundreds of Neolithic sites, six hundred and seventy-four ancient buildings, one hundred and fifty-eight stone carvings, one hundred and eighty-nine tombs from the Six Dynasties to the Song Dynasty, seventy-four kiln sites from the Tang, Song, and Ming Dynasties, and one hundred and thirty-five other scattered cultural relics; and collected six hundred and seventy-nine revolutionary cultural relics.

Almost all of the forty-three counties surveyed had Neolithic sites. Among the two thousand nine hundred and thirteen stone tools collected, stone adzes were the most numerous, followed by stone axes, and they were all polished, with very few chipped stone tools. Among the four hundred and eight complete pottery pieces and more than tens of thousands of pottery shards obtained, there were painted pottery and stamped hard pottery. These all have the characteristics of the Southeast stamped pottery culture, and are physical materials for the study of Fujian's primitive social history.

Among the ancient kiln sites discovered and the three hundred and forty pieces of porcelain and porcelain shards collected, the Tang Dynasty kiln was discovered for the first time in Fujian. Kiln sites from the Song Dynasty were almost all over the coastal counties, with abundant products and exquisite manufacturing techniques, which may be related to foreign trade in the Song Dynasty. These large numbers of sites and relics can greatly supplement the research materials on the history of Chinese porcelain.

Earth pit tombs from the Han and Wei periods were discovered on the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway, and pottery with stamped square patterns was unearthed, belonging to the early porcelain of China. More than 800 iron Buddha statues from the Ming Dynasty were discovered in Ningde County. There was a rare "tribute list" for grain requisition during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. There were dozens of battlefields and beacon towers of the Ming Dynasty national hero Qi Jiguang who quelled the倭寇 (Japanese pirates). In addition, the sites of the Chinese Soviet era were investigated, and various currencies and cultural relics from that time were collected.

The Fujian Museum is currently further sorting out these relics.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 29th: The Fujian Cultural Relics Survey Team recently discovered a Han Dynasty ancient city site and a large number of cultural relics in Chengcun, seventy li south of Chong'an County. This is the earliest Han Dynasty site discovered in Fujian.

The site is located on a flat hill about ten to twenty meters high southwest of Chengcun, covering eight hilltops, stretching for two li, and there are still broken city walls about three meters high. Inside the city, discontinuous gravel road surfaces were found, as well as a large number of thick cord-patterned cylindrical tiles, flat tiles, and hard pottery shards printed with square patterns. A kind of flat tile with seal characters printed on the back was also discovered. On the hilltop platform where the tiles are concentrated, there is a nearly square stone column base. In addition, fragments of stone adzes and stone axes were also obtained. According to the cultural relics unearthed at the city site, archaeologists have initially judged that this ancient city site can be traced back to the Qin and Han Dynasties.

    福建发现大批古代遗址和革命文物
    新华社福州29日电　福建文物普查工作去年获得丰收。从去年4月到年底的八个月时间内，福建文物普查队在四十三个县中进行了普查，共计发现新石器时代遗址数百处，古建筑物六百七十四处，石刻一百五十八处，六朝至宋的墓葬一百八十九处，唐宋明的窑址七十四处和其他流散文物一百三十五处；收集革命文物六百七十九件。
    普查的四十三个县几乎都有新石器时代遗址。采集的二千九百一十三件石器，以石?最多，石?次之，而且都是磨光的，打制的石器很少；获得的四百零八件光整的陶器和数万片以上的陶片中，有彩陶和印纹硬陶。这些都具有东南印纹陶文化的特点，为研究福建原始社会史的实物资料。
    在发现的古窑址和收集的三百四十件瓷器和瓷片中，唐窑在福建还是第一次发现；而宋代的窑址几乎遍布沿海各县，产品丰富，制技精巧，可能与宋代对外通商有关。这些大量的遗址、遗物，可以大大补充我国瓷器史的研究资料。
    在南福铁路发现了汉魏时期的土坑墓，出土有印方格纹陶，属于我国早期的瓷器。在宁德县发现了明代铁佛像八百多尊。有罕见的太平天国时征粮的“贡单”。有明代民族英雄戚继光平倭寇的战场和烟火台数十处。此外，还调查了中华苏维埃时代的遗址，收集到当时的钱币、文物等多种。
    目前福建博物馆正在进一步整理这些遗物。
    新华社福州29日电　福建文物普查队最近在崇安县南七十华里的城村发现一座汉代古城遗址和大量文物。这是福建发现最早的汉代遗址。
    遗址在城村西南的高约十至二十公尺的平坦山丘上，范围包括八个山岗，纵横达二华里，还残存着约三公尺高的断续的城墙。城内发现有断续的碎石路面，有大量粗大的绳纹筒瓦、板瓦和印有方格纹硬陶片，还发现一种板瓦背面印有篆文。在瓦片集中的山岗平台上有一近方形石柱础，另外还获得有片段的石?和石?。考古工作者根据城址出土的文物初步判断，认为这座古城遗址可以上推到秦汉时代。
