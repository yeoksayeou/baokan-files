    When the Dirge of Lenin's Death Reached China

    "Lenin's death is a loss for all mankind, no small matter; especially for our Chinese nation, the loss of such an important friend makes us feel endlessly grieved!"

    Comrade Li Dazhao's words concentratedly expressed the sorrow of the Chinese people thirty-five years ago, when the dirge of Comrade Lenin's death reached China. The Chinese people found the path to liberate themselves under the radiant light of the October Revolution, and Lenin's theory of national and colonial revolution and his kind guidance to the Chinese revolution pointed out a clear direction for the Chinese people. After Lenin's death, in the memorial services held in various parts of China, and in the special issues published by various progressive publications, the Chinese people expressed their infinite sorrow and respect for this great teacher and friend. At the same time, they also expressed their confidence in learning from Lenin, studying and propagating Marxist theory, and completing the Chinese revolution according to the path pointed out by Lenin.

    In 1924, Beijing, despite being under the direct rule of the Northern Warlords, held a grand "Chinese National Memorial Meeting for Lenin" in Central Park (now Zhongshan Park), and compiled and printed a "Lenin Memorial Album" (see picture). The main contents of the memorial album were Comrade Li Dazhao's "Lenin is Immortal" and Chapter 5 of Lenin's "State and Revolution" (published under the title "Evolution of Communist Society"). Comrade Li Dazhao praised "Lenin as a good friend of weak nations, a loyal servant of the oppressed, and a brave warrior dedicated to the world revolution"; in addition, memorial albums were also published in Shanghai, Changsha, Chengdu, and other places.

    Progressive publications directly led by the Chinese Communist Party or under its influence all published special issues to mourn Lenin, introduce Lenin's life and thought, and his theory and its relationship with the Chinese revolution. The organ of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, "Chinese Youth," issued a "Lenin Special Issue" on February 2, publishing articles such as Comrade Yun Daiying's "Lenin and the Chinese Revolution" and Comrade Deng Zhongxia's "Lenin Chronology." The supplement "Awakening" of the Shanghai Republican Daily successively published more than a dozen commemorative articles and translations from February to July, including Comrade Zhang Tailei's "The Death of Lenin" and Comrade Zhao Shiyan's "The World, Lenin, and Leninism." Guangzhou's "New Student Semi-Monthly" published a "Commemorating the February 7th Massacre and Mourning Lenin Issue," which published Comrade Li Dazhao's and Mr. Liao Zhongkai's speeches at the memorial service in Guangzhou, as well as papers such as "Lenin, National Self-Determination, and World Revolution." All these articles in these publications actually formed a widespread propaganda movement to disseminate Marxist-Leninist theory on the Chinese revolution, which played a significant role in promoting the Chinese people, especially the youth, to participate in the democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party.

### 当列宁逝世的哀音传到中国的时候

    当列宁逝世的哀音传到中国的时候
    “列宁逝世，全人类的损失，真不在小；尤其是我们中华民族，损失了一个这样重要的朋友，更使我们伤感无已！”
    李大钊同志的这一段话，集中地表达了三十五年以前，当列宁同志逝世的哀音传到中国时，中国人民的悲痛心情。中国人民是在十月革命的光辉照耀下找到了解放自己的道路的，而列宁关于民族殖民地革命的理论和对于中国革命的亲切教导，更给中国人民指引了明确的方向。列宁逝世以后，在中国各地举行的追悼会上，在各种进步刊物所出版的特刊上，中国人民表示了对于这位伟大的导师和朋友的无限的哀思和敬意，同时，也表示了学习列宁、学习和宣传马克思主义理论、按照列宁指出的道路完成中国革命的信心。
    1924年的北京，尽管是处在北洋军阀的直接统治下，还是在中央公园（即现在的中山公园）举行了隆重的“中国国民追悼列宁大会”，并且编印了“列宁纪念册”（见图）。纪念册的主要内容是李大钊同志所写的“列宁不死”和列宁的著作“国家与革命”的第五章（以“共产主义社会底进化”为题发表）。李大钊同志称颂“列宁是弱小民族的良友，是被压迫者的忠仆，是献身于世界革命的一个仁勇的战士”；此外，上海、长沙、成都等地也都出版了纪念册。
    中国共产党直接领导的或在党影响下的进步刊物，都纷纷出版特刊悼念列宁，介绍列宁的生平和思想以及他的理论与中国革命的关系。中国社会主义青年团的机关刊“中国青年”于2月2日发行“列宁特号”，刊载了恽代英同志的“列宁与中国的革命”和邓中夏同志的“列宁年谱”等文章。上海民国日报的副刊“觉悟”，从2月到7月陆续发表了十几篇纪念文章和译文，其中包括张太雷同志的“列宁底死”，赵世炎同志的“世界与列宁及列宁主义”等文。广州的“新学生半月刊”出版了“纪念二七并追悼列宁号”，刊载了李大钊同志和廖仲恺先生在广州的追悼会上的演讲以及“列宁与民族自决论与世界革命”等论文。所有这些刊物上的文章，实际上形成了一个广泛传播马克思列宁主义关于中国革命理论的宣传运动，对推动中国人民特别是青年们参加中国共产党所领导的民主革命，起了重大的作用。
