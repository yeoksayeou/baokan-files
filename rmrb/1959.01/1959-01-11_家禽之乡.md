Anyone who has been to Huanglong Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, will be very interested in the township's poultry production. This township raises a large number of chickens, ducks, and geese, with some households averaging more than a hundred birds, and others averaging dozens. As you enter the village outskirts of this township, you can hear the "cock-a-doodle-doo... quack quack..." of poultry calls from afar. On the streets and in the farmers' homes, you see flocks of chickens and ducks with red, white, patterned, and yellow feathers gleaming in the sun. No wonder the representatives who attended the Southern Ten Provinces Poultry Production On-site Meeting in Huanglong Township said: This township truly deserves its name as the Homeland of Poultry!

The township's ability to have so much poultry is the result of people working hard, striving for excellence, and laboring diligently under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line.

Last winter and spring, a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production swept across the country. Under the guiding ideology of taking grain as the lead and promoting a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural and sideline production, the township Party committee seriously criticized the past thinking of not attaching importance to poultry production, and established a comprehensive production perspective. Subsequently, the township Party committee launched a vigorous campaign to develop poultry production among the masses, using detailed accounting methods to explain the great significance of raising poultry for supporting national construction and agricultural production, as well as improving living standards, which aroused the attention of the masses and relevant departments to poultry production. The township Party committee also mobilized commune members to search for wild feed in the mountains, fields, and marshes, and also used artificial breeding of feed, and uniformly reclaimed wasteland to plant feed, solving the feed problem.

Regarding the problem of poultry harming crops, people tried every means: using empty spaces and courtyards to enclose them with wooden boards and bamboo strips for raising poultry in isolation; generally establishing open-air chicken farms; and before the rice was ripe and harvested, assigning special personnel to graze ducks. In this way, chickens and ducks no longer harmed crops.

In the prevention and treatment of poultry diseases, a combination of indigenous and foreign methods was adopted, summarizing the experience of the masses, and creating and discovering many effective prescriptions for treating poultry diseases, with very good treatment results.

"To get money from livestock, you must sleep with livestock," is a saying circulating in rural areas. It fully reflects the tremendous hard work people put into raising livestock. In this township, there are many moving stories in the raising of poultry. For example, Liu Chuntao, a 16-year-old female breeder from Gaofu Cooperative, raised more than 1,600 poultry for the cooperative. In March last year, these poultry were newly born, and a cold wave struck. In order to prevent the loss of the cooperative's property, she braved the biting cold and slept in the open chicken and duck shed, getting up countless times at night to take care of the young poultry. Seeing the young poultry huddled together from the cold, she hugged them to her chest to keep them warm.

Hard work will be rewarded with fruitful results. Female commune member Qi Donglian used vegetable leaves, small insects, and wild plants as feed to raise more than 40 chickens and ducks in the previous year. The income from selling fresh eggs and chickens and ducks, in addition to solving the family's expenses for oil, salt, pocket money, and other miscellaneous items for all six members, also allowed each person to make a new set of clothes. Commune members deeply realized the benefits of vigorously developing poultry production, which not only supported national construction, but also supported agricultural production and increased personal income.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, poultry production was uniformly managed by the commune. The commune adopted a system of hierarchical management and overproduction bonuses, established specialized teams at each level, assigned tasks to individuals, and implemented a "four-fixed" method of fixing people, quantity, production, and rewards and punishments. The commune also stipulated that a "four-comparison" red flag competition should be held every month, focusing on comparing tasks, measures, enthusiasm, and feeding management, in order to promote the comprehensive development of poultry production in the commune. Now, this township is actively carrying out winter incubation, striving for an even greater leap forward in poultry production in 1959.

    家禽之乡
    邓漪
    到过湖南湘潭县黄龙乡的人们，对这个乡的家禽生产都会感到很大兴趣。这个乡饲养有大量的鸡、鸭、鹅，这些家禽有的平均每户有一百多只，有的平均几十只。一进这个乡的村庄边缘，就远远传来“喔喔喔……呷呷呷……”的禽鸣声。街道上、农家里，呈现在眼里的是红的、白的、花的、黄的……羽光灿烂的鸡鸭群。难怪在黄龙乡参加南方十省家禽生产现场会的代表们说：这个乡真是名不虚传的家禽之乡！
    这个乡能够有这么多家禽，是人们在党的总路线光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲、力争上游、辛勤劳动的结果。
    前冬去春，全国各地掀起了生产大跃进高潮。乡党委在粮食带头、农副业全面跃进的指导思想下，认真地批判了过去不重视家禽生产的思想，树立了全面生产观点。随后，乡党委在群众中开展了声势浩大的发展家禽生产的运动，用算细账的方法，说明饲养家禽对支援国家建设和农业生产以及改善生活的重大意义，引起了群众和有关部门对家禽生产的重视。乡党委又发动社员向山上、田野、沼河寻找野生饲料，同时还用人工繁殖饲料，又统一开荒栽种饲料，解决了饲料问题。
    对于家禽伤害农作物的问题，人们想尽了千方百计：利用空坪、空院用木板、竹片围挡起来，圈养隔离；普遍建立起露天鸡场；在稻谷成熟未收割之前，专人放牧鸭子。这样，鸡鸭也再不伤害农作物了。
    在防治家禽疫病方面，采取了土洋结合的办法，总结群众的经验，创造和发现了许多治疗家禽疫病的良方，治疗效果很好。
    “要得畜牲钱，必与畜牲眠”，这是流传在农村的谚语。它充分反映人们饲养畜牲付出了莫大的辛勤劳动。这个乡在饲养家禽中，就有着许多动人的事例。如高福社一个十六岁的女饲养员刘春桃，饲养着社里一千六百多只家禽。去年3月间，这些家禽出生不久，正逢寒潮到来。她为了社里的财产不受损失，冒着刺骨的寒冷，自己睡在敞开的鸡鸭棚里，晚上起来无数次照顾幼禽。见到幼禽冷得缩成一团，她就把幼禽抱在胸前取暖。
    辛勤的劳动，是会换来丰硕的果实的。女社员齐冬莲在前年利用菜叶、小虫与野生植物等饲料饲养四十多只鸡鸭，出售的鲜蛋和鸡鸭的收入，除解决全家六口人的油盐、零花等杂用钱外，每人还制了一套新衣服。社员们深深体会到大力发展家禽生产，既支援了国家建设，又支援了农业生产，也增加了个人收入的好处。
    在建成人民公社以后，家禽生产由公社统一经营。公社采取分级管理、超产奖励制度，层层建立专业队，将任务固定到人，实行定人、定量、定产、定奖罚的四定办法。公社还规定每月举行一次以比任务、比措施、比干劲、比饲养管理为主的四比红旗竞赛，以推动公社家禽生产的全面发展。现在，这个乡正在积级开展冬孵，争取1959年家禽生产有个更大的跃进。（附图片）
