    A Note in the Dining Car

    The train's dining car was serving the last meals of the evening.

    A tall, bespectacled woman, appearing to be under thirty years old, wearing a faded yellow army uniform, was sitting at a table near the exit. After she finished her meal, she asked my female classmate's loose-leaf notebook for a piece of paper and returned to her own table to write rapidly.

    She quickly finished writing and left. The waiter picked up the note left under the plate, nodding and smiling as he read it. I thought it must be a strange suggestion, and curiosity drove me to ask the waiter for the note. When I looked at it, it simply said: "Comrade Waiter, please scald the tableware I used several times with boiling water, because I have a lung disease, so as not to infect other passengers. Thank you, with respect!"

    餐车里的一张字条
    列车的餐车里，正在开最后一批晚饭。
    一个高个子，戴眼镜的女同志，看去还不到三十岁，穿着一套褪了色的黄军装，坐在一张靠出口的桌上。她吃完饭后，向我那邻座的女同学带的那个活页本上要了一页纸，回到自己的餐桌上就哗哗地写起来。
    她匆匆地写完就走了，服务员拿起了这张压在菜盘下的留条，边看边笑着点点头，我想，这一定是提了个奇怪的意见，好奇心驱使我向服务员把这张纸条要来，一看，上面写的只是两句很简单的话：“服务员同志，我用过的餐具，请您用开水多烫几次，因为我有肺病，以免传染给别的旅客，麻烦您，敬礼！”
