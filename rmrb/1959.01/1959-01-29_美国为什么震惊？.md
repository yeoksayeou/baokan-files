Why is the United States Shocked?
Xiang Chao

    The struggle of the Congolese people against colonial rule, which broke out on January 4, shocked the American ruling clique. The United States launched a frenzied propaganda campaign to slander and intimidate the Congolese people and support Belgian colonialism. On January 17, the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Satterthwaite, even put forward the argument that the African continent should "develop in a stable and orderly manner," insidiously attacking the struggle of the Congolese people.

    It is no accident that the American ruling clique is so shocked. The Congo was one of the earliest regions where the United States carried out colonial activities in Africa. The Congo's fall into Belgian colonial rule was also inseparable from the activities of the United States. From 1884 to 1885, colonial countries held a conference in Berlin to divide up African colonies. At this conference, the United States was the first to agree to place the Congo under the rule of Belgian King Leopold. At that time, the US Ambassador to Belgium, Henry S. Sanford, actively campaigned for Leopold at the Berlin Conference, enabling this proposal to be passed. Thus, in August 1885, Leopold declared himself the king of the so-called "Congo Free State." From then on, the Congolese people fell into an incomparably cruel colonial hell.

    Growing Investment
    The Congo, along with South Africa, Liberia, and Rhodesia, were the earliest investment regions for the United States in Africa. As early as 1907, American capitalists Thomas F. Ryan and Daniel Guggenheim were active in the Congo, investing in the "International Congo Forestry and Mining Company."

    After World War II, American capital infiltrated the Congo on a large scale. American companies such as "International Basic Economy Corporation," "Pacific Steel Company," "American Leam Company," and "International Business Machines Corporation" all set up factories in the Congo or acquired shares in Belgian companies. In 1950, American capital began to penetrate the Congo's largest monopoly organization, the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga. The Rockefeller family, through the Bank of England, acquired some equity. In the same year, the United States sent a financial delegation headed by Winthrop Aldrich of Chase Bank to discuss with the Belgian authorities the issue of promoting American investment in the Congo. Subsequently, the World Bank and the Export-Import Bank provided loans of 70 million and 15.5 million US dollars respectively, paving the way for American private investment. In recent years, the United States has invested 80 million US dollars in the Congo annually. The United States has effectively controlled one-third of the shares of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga and also holds a large number of shares in other large mining and plantation companies. Fifteen percent of the Congo's exports are shipped to the United States, and 33 percent of its imports come from the United States.

    As early as the end of World War II, the United States obtained the vast majority of the Congo's uranium ore products, which were used to start manufacturing the first atomic weapons. Now it monopolizes 90% of the Congo's uranium ore products and all of the cobalt, the raw material for manufacturing hydrogen weapons. In addition, the United States also controls many other important minerals in the Congo. Under the large-scale plunder of American capital, the Congo's mining production has grown at a rate of 6% per year in recent times, far exceeding the growth rate of developed capitalist countries. The Congo has become the United States' most important source of strategic raw materials and a source of huge profits.

    Huge Military Base Network
    The United States maintains a vast network of military bases in Africa. Among them, the military bases in the Congo are of particular importance to the United States.

    After World War II, the United States built forty-six airfields in the Congo. The air base near Kamina is the largest, known as "one of the largest bases in the world." The runway of this base is eight miles long and can withstand the takeoff and landing of aircraft weighing up to 135 tons. The base has a total area of 125,000 acres and can accommodate three airlift divisions or provide training for 17,000 air force pilots.

    The 300-mile-long railway line from Kamina to Kabalo was also completed in 1956. This is part of the trans-African transportation line from Lobito on the west coast to Dar es Salaam on the east coast. This railway line is of great economic and strategic significance.

    In addition, the United States has also built a naval base in Boma at the mouth of the Congo River.

    The United States' selection of the Congo region to build large-scale military bases is closely related to its colonial expansion throughout Africa. Although American investment has now spread to all African countries, most of the capital is concentrated in the Congo, the Central African Federation (Southern and Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland) and the Union of South Africa, south of the equator. These three regions produce the most valuable strategic raw materials such as uranium, cobalt, and copper, as well as the most valuable minerals such as gold and diamonds. The purpose of the United States in building huge military bases in the Congo is to strengthen its control over the Congo and the adjacent Central African Federation and the Union of South Africa, and to block the development of the national independence movements in West and East Africa. After the Congolese people launched a large-scale anti-colonial rule struggle on January 4, Belgium was able to quickly mobilize paratroopers and air force to suppress it, and the US military base network should be said to have played a certain role.

    Hit the US Where it Hurts
    Profit, strategic resources, and a so-called suitable "political climate" are the three main conditions that the United States often considers when choosing key areas for colonial expansion in Africa. In the eyes of the American ruling clique, the Belgian Congo was once a rare area where all three conditions were met. Many American political commentators admit that bases and uranium mines largely determine the US attitude towards many sensitive issues in Africa. Therefore, how to deal with the increasingly developing national independence movement of the Congolese people will become an increasingly important issue on the US agenda for aggression in Africa. After the Congolese people launched a large-scale struggle against colonial rule on January 4, the American mouthpiece newspapers were furious, and the American officials pretended to be silent, all reflecting that this struggle hit the key point of American colonial expansion.

    The US authorities are worried about how to continue to maintain its colonial interests in the Congo if Belgian colonial rule is weakened or even overthrown. At the same time, it also sees more clearly from the storm in Leopoldville that the end of colonialism is getting closer and closer throughout Africa. In this case, US Assistant Secretary of State Satterthwaite hypocritically stated that "the United States sympathetically approves of the reasonable aspirations of the African people," but at the same time wants the African people to carry out "stable and orderly development" and "must and should receive the cooperation and assistance of its Western world partners." However, this two-faced approach is not new at all, and it will not be suitable for dealing with the Congolese people. Belgian colonial rule, with the support of the United States, is still bound to be shaky, so how can the United States hope that the Congolese people are prepared to endure the shackles of the United States.

    美国为什么震惊？
    象超
    1月4日爆发的刚果人民反对殖民统治的斗争，震撼了美国统治集团。美国发动了疯狂的污蔑和威吓刚果人民、支持比利时殖民主义的宣传运动。负责非洲事务的美国助理国务卿萨脱斯威特，在1月17日更提出了非洲大陆应当“稳定和秩序井然地发展”的论调，含沙射影地攻击刚果人民的斗争。
    美国统治集团这样震惊不是偶然的。刚果是美国在非洲进行殖民活动的最早的一个地区。刚果之沦为比利时的殖民地，也是和美国的活动分不开的。1884到1885年，殖民国家在柏林召开了瓜分非洲殖民地的会议。在这次会议上，美国首先同意把刚果划归比利时国王利奥波尔统治。当时美国驻比利时大使亨利·斯·桑弗德并为利奥波尔在柏林会议上进行了积极活动，使这一主张得以通过。于是，利奥波尔在1885年8月宣称自己是所谓“刚果自由国”的国王。从此，刚果人民沦入了残酷无比的殖民地狱。
    越来越大的投资
    刚果和南非、利比里亚、罗得西亚，都是美国在非洲的最早的投资地区。早在1907年，美国资本家托马斯·弗·弗琼和丹尼尔·古根海姆就在刚果进行活动，向“国际刚果林业矿业公司”投资。
    第二次世界大战后，美国资本大规模渗入刚果。美国的“国际基本商品公司”、“太平洋钢铁公司”、“美国垒木公司”、“国际商用机器公司”等都在刚果设立了工厂，或者取得比利时企业的股份。1950年，美国资本开始打入刚果最大的垄断组织——上卡当加矿业联合公司。美国的洛克菲勒财团通过英格兰银行，取得了部分股权。同年，美国又派出了以“大通银行”的温特罗甫·阿尔德里奇为首的财政代表团和比利时当局讨论促进美国对刚果的投资问题。接着世界银行和进出口银行就分别提供了七千万美元和一千五百五十万美元的贷款，为美国私人投资铺平了道路。最近几年来，美国每年向刚果的投资达八千万美元。美国已经实际控制了上卡当加矿业联合公司股份的三分之一，还掌握了其他大矿业和种植园公司的大量股票。刚果出口的商品有15％运往美国，并自美国进口33％的商品。
    美国早在第二次大战末期就取得了刚果绝大部分的铀矿产品，用来着手制造第一批原子武器。现在它垄断了刚果铀矿产品的90％，制造氢武器原料——钴的全部。此外，美国也控制了刚果其他许多重要矿产。在美国资本的大规模掠夺下，刚果的矿业生产在最近时期以每年6％的速度增长着，大大超过了发达的资本主义国家的增长速度。刚果已成了美国最重要的战略原料产地和榨取巨额利润的泉源。
    巨大的军事基地网
    美国在非洲保有一个庞大的军事基地网。其中在刚果的军事基地对美国来说，具有特殊重要意义。
    二次大战后，美国便在刚果建筑了四十六个空军机场。在加米纳附近的空军基地，规模最大，号称“世界最大基地之一”。这个基地的飞机跑道长达八英里，可以承受重达一百三十五吨的飞机起飞和降落。基地总面积十二万五千英亩，可以容纳三个空运师或者供一万七千名空军驾驶员进行训练之用。
    从加米纳通往卡巴罗的长达三百英里的铁路线，也已在1956年建成。这是从西海岸的罗比托到东海岸的达累斯萨拉姆的横贯非洲大陆的交通线的一部分。这条铁路线在经济上和战略上都具有重大意义。
    此外，美国在刚果河口的波马，还筑有海军基地。
    美国选中刚果这个地区建造大规模的军事基地，和它在整个非洲的殖民扩张，有着十分密切的关系。美国投资今天虽然已经遍及非洲各国，但是，大部资本都集中在赤道以南的刚果、中非联邦（南、北罗得西亚、尼亚萨兰）和南非联邦。这三个地区生产了最贵重的战略原料铀、钴和铜等以及最贵重的矿产品黄金、钻石等。美国在刚果建造巨大军事基地的目的，就在于加强对刚果以及相邻的中非联邦和南非联邦的控制，阻挡西非和东非民族独立运动的发展。1月4日刚果人民爆发了大规模的反殖民统治斗争以后，比利时能够迅速调动伞兵和空军进行镇压，美国的军事基地网应该说是起了一定作用的。
    击中了美国的要害
    利润、战略资源和所谓合适的“政治气候”，是美国在非洲选择殖民扩张重点地区时经常考虑的三个主要条件。在美国统治集团看来，比属刚果过去是难得的三个条件齐备的地区之一。美国许多政论家承认，基地和铀矿在很大程度上决定了美国对非洲许多尖锐问题的态度。因此，如何对付刚果人民日益发展的民族独立运动，将成为美国侵略非洲日程表上越来越重要的问题。1月4日，刚果人民发动大规模的反对殖民统治斗争以后，美国御用报纸暴跳如雷，美国官方故作沉默，都反映了这次斗争击中了美国殖民扩张的要害。
    美国当局正在担心在比利时殖民统治一旦遭到削弱甚至被推翻的情况下，如何继续维持它在刚果的殖民利益。同时，它也从利奥波德维尔的风暴中更清楚地看到殖民主义在整个非洲的末日越来越近了。在这种情况下，美国助理国务卿萨脱斯威特一面假惺惺地表示“美国以同情的态度赞成非洲人民的合理愿望”，但是，同时又要非洲人民进行“稳定和秩序井然的发展”，“必须得到也应该得到它的西方世界伙伴的合作和援助”。但是，这种两面手法一点也不新奇，用来对付刚果人民也不会合适。比利时的殖民统治在美国支持下仍不免摇摇欲坠，美国又怎么能够希望刚果人民准备承受美国的镣铐。
