"Economic Research" Magazine
Discusses Commodity Production and the Law of Value

The first issue of the "Economic Research" magazine for 1959, published today, features a "Special Issue on Commodity Production and the Law of Value under the Socialist System." The special issue publishes eleven articles written by fifteen comrades, including Xu Dixing, Xue Muqiao, Wang Sihua, Zhang Yifei, Zhu Jiannong, and Jiang Xuemo, as well as a record of a symposium with comrades from economic work departments. The discussion covers many issues, and opinions differ. The main issues are the trend of commodity production under the socialist system, the scope of the law of value, whether means of production are commodities domestically, and commodity exchange versus product exchange.

I. On the trend of commodity production under the socialist system, in addition to the unanimous agreement that it must be greatly developed, Zhang Yifei put forward his views on the future disappearance of commodity production and commodity circulation. He believes that whether commodity production and commodity circulation will only completely disappear when entering a communist society should be observed from both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of commodities. Because the development process of the quantitative aspect of commodities is closely linked to the disappearance process of the qualitative aspect. If only observed from the quantitative aspect of commodities, commodities will seem to develop straightforwardly, developing until society enters communism and then completely disappear. If observed from the qualitative aspect of commodities, the situation is different. The quality of commodities will constantly change with each step of change in social and economic relations. The change in the quality of commodities is to constantly weaken the commodities themselves, causing the commodities to constantly move in the direction of no longer being commodities. When society enters communism, commodities will eventually tend to disappear.

II. Regarding the scope of the law of value, one view is that the regulatory effect of the law of value on socialist production is limited, but it still has an impact. Xu Dixing's article states: "Under the conditions of socialist production, the law of value still has a regulatory effect on the circulation of commodities; however, its regulatory effect on commodity production is limited. Generally speaking, the circulation process of commodities is closely linked to the production process, and the regulatory effect of the law of value in the circulation process will inevitably affect production. Under the socialist system, this influence is consciously utilized by the state." Another view is that the argument that the law of value only has an "influence" but no effect on socialist production is inappropriate. Zhu Jiannong said: The law of value has a certain effect on socialist production and its commodity circulation, whether it is the circulation of means of production or the circulation of consumer goods, but it has no regulatory effect. He believes that socialist production, whether it is the production of consumer goods or the production of means of production, is commodity production. The law of value is the inherent law of commodity production. It should not be regarded as something external to commodity production to have an "influence." Therefore, there is no need to use the term "influence."

Regarding the effect of the law of value on the production of people's communes, Xue Muqiao believes that the production of people's communes is basically regulated by the state. The state regulates it through planning on the one hand, and through supply and marketing relationships on the other, which means that it still has to utilize the law of value. Wang Sihua believes that in the state-owned economy under the system of ownership by the whole people, the law of value only plays the role of an economic accounting tool, while in the cooperative economy under the system of collective ownership, the law of value plays a certain role. Jiang Xuemo believes that within the scope of state-owned enterprises under the system of ownership by the whole people, the law of value has indeed lost its role as a production regulator. However, for the production of people's communes, the law of value will still maintain a certain regulatory effect. Zhu Jiannong believes that the law of value will of course have an effect on the commodity production of people's communes, but for the communes' self-sufficient production, the law of value can have a certain "influence" as an external economic law.

III. On the question of whether means of production are commodities domestically, there are two different opinions. One view is that some are commodities and some are not. Wang Sihua's article states: The exchange of products between two different ownership systems—ownership by the whole people and collective ownership—must take the form of buying and selling commodities. Tractors and various agricultural machinery produced by state-owned enterprises and sold to cooperatives are commodities. Means of production allocated within state-owned enterprises cannot be said to be commodities. Another view is that means of production are also commodities. Zhu Jiannong said: Although the transfer of ownership does not occur when means of production are transferred from one state-owned enterprise to another in a socialist society, it is indeed exchanged through buying and selling in accordance with the principle of equivalent exchange. This is no different from the equivalent exchange of consumer goods through buying and selling. One cannot consider consumer goods to be commodities on the one hand and deny that means of production are commodities on the other. The assertion that means of production seem to retain only the outer "shell" of commodities and have lost the "characteristics" of commodities does not conform to socialist reality. Wang Zhuo and Dai Yuanchen also believe that mechanically placing means of production outside the scope of commodities is incorrect.

IV. The issue of commodity exchange and product exchange. Wang Zhuo and Dai Yuanchen believe that the current relationship between the state and the communes is not just a relationship of commodity exchangers, and there are already elements of product exchange. The exchange between them does not follow the principle of equivalent exchange like commodity exchange. "A baby is in the mother's belly," and the factors of product exchange were already being conceived when the state and the communes engaged in commodity exchange. The authors believe that some people's views cannot be considered correct, such as: exchange through currency is commodity exchange, and exchange without currency is product exchange; exchange outside the plan is commodity exchange, and exchange within the plan is product exchange; exchange between two ownership systems is all commodity exchange, while exchange between state-owned enterprises under the system of ownership by the whole people is product exchange; and so on. Regarding whether exchanges within the economy of ownership by the whole people are commodity exchanges, Wu Jinglian believes that they are no longer true commodity exchange relations, but only retain traces of commodity exchange to a certain extent, that is, they apply the principle of equivalent exchange, which is also common in commodity exchange, to varying degrees. It is appropriate to call the exchange between enterprises under the system of ownership by the whole people "product exchange."

    “经济研究”杂志
    讨论商品生产和价值规律问题
    今天出版的“经济研究”杂志1959年第一期有一个“社会主义制度下商品生产价值规律问题讨论特辑”。特辑发表了许涤新、薛暮桥、王思华、张翼飞、朱剑农、蒋学模等十五位同志写的十一篇文章，和一份经济工作部门有关同志的座谈记录。讨论所涉及的问题很多，意见也有分歧。其中主要的有社会主义制度下商品生产的趋势、价值规律的作用范围、生产资料在国内是否商品、商品交换和产品交换等四个问题。
    一、社会主义制度下商品生产的趋势问题，除一致认为必须大大发展而外，张翼飞对商品生产和商品流通将来的消亡问题提出了他的看法。他认为商品生产和商品流通是不是只有进入共产主义社会时才一下子完全消亡，应该从商品的量和质两方面来观察。因为商品量的方面的发展过程是和商品质的方面的消亡过程紧密结合在一起的。如果单从商品量的方面观察，商品将似乎是一往直前发展的，将一直发展到社会进入共产主义时才完全消亡。如果从商品质的方面观察，情况就不同了。商品的质，则将随着每一步的社会经济关系的改变而不断地改变着。商品质的改变，就是使商品自身不断地削弱，使商品不断的向不再成其为商品的方向前进。到社会进入共产主义时，商品也就最后趋于消亡。
    二、关于价值规律的作用范围问题，一种意见是，价值规律对社会主义生产的调节作用受到了限制，但还有影响。许涤新的文章说：“在社会主义生产的条件下，价值规律对于商品的流通，还有调节作用；而对于商品生产的调节作用，则受到了限制。一般说来，商品的流通过程同生产过程，是密切联系的，价值规律在流通过程中的调节作用，必然会影响生产。在社会主义制度之下，这种影响是被国家所自觉地利用的。”另一种意见认为，价值规律对社会主义生产只有“影响”而没有作用的论点，是不恰当的。朱剑农说：价值规律对社会主义生产及其商品流通，不论是生产资料的流通或消费品的流通，都有一定的作用，但都没有调节作用。他认为，社会主义的生产，不管是消费品的生产或生产资料的生产，都是商品生产。价值规律是商品生产的内在规律。不应该把价值规律视为商品生产的外在的东西来发生“影响”。因此无需乎用“影响”的说法。
    关于价值规律对人民公社生产的作用问题，薛暮桥认为：人民公社的生产，基本上是由国家来调节的。国家一方面通过计划来调节，一方面还要通过供销关系来调节，就是还要利用价值规律。王思华认为：在全民所有制的国营经济中，价值规律只起经济核算工具的作用，在集体所有制下的合作经济中，价值规律才起着一定作用，蒋学模认为：在全民所有制企业范围之内，价值规律确实丧失了生产调节者的作用。但对于人民公社的生产，价值规律仍然将保持一定的调节作用。朱剑农认为，价值规律对人民公社的商品生产当然要发生作用，但对公社的自给生产，价值规律可以作为一种外在的经济规律发生一定的
  “影响”。
    三、生产资料在国内是否商品问题，有两种不同意见。一种意见认为：一部分是商品，一部分不是商品，王思华的文章说：在两种不同所有制——全民所有制和集体所有制之间的产品交换，必然采取买卖的商品形式。由国营企业生产而卖给合作社的拖拉机和各种农业机械，这些生产资料就是商品。在国营企业内部调拨的生产资料不能说是商品。另一种意见认为生产资料也是商品。朱剑农说：社会主义社会的生产资料从一个国营企业调拨到另一个国营企业，虽不发生所有权的转移，但它确实是按照等价交换的原则通过买卖的形式而交换的。这一点与消费品通过买卖的形式而进行的等价交换，没有什么不同。不能一方面认为消费品是商品，另一方面又否认生产资料是商品。那种认为似乎生产资料仅仅保持着商品的外“壳”，它已失去商品的“特性”的论断，不符合社会主义现实生活。王琢和戴园晨也认为：机械地把生产资料放到商品范围之外，是不正确的。
    四、商品交换和产品交换问题。王琢和戴园晨认为：目前国家和公社的关系中，并不是只是商品交换者的关系，已经存在着产品交换的因素。它们之间的交换并不像商品交换那样通行着等价交换的原则。“妈妈肚里有娃娃”，在国家和公社进行商品交换的时候，就已经孕育着产品交换的因素了。作者认为，有一些人的看法不能认为是正确的。如：通过货币的交换是商品交换，不通过货币的交换是产品交换；计划外的交换是商品交换，计划内的交换是产品交换；两种所有制之间的交换都是商品交换，而全民所有制的国营企业之间的交换则是产品交换；等等。全民所有制经济内部的交换是否商品交换，吴敬琏认为已经不是真正的商品交换关系，只不过多少还遗留着商品交换的痕迹，即程度不等地应用着在商品交换中也通行的等价交换原则。把全民所有制企业间的交换称作“产品交换”是妥当的。
