    A Person Who Shares Weal and Woe with the Masses
    Gao Zhi
    From the title "County Party Secretary," one can imagine that this film must be about a county party secretary as the protagonist; however, the film doesn't introduce this protagonist to us directly at the beginning but uses a roundabout approach to write about him from the side: Many people want to find the county party secretary, but they are blocked by the county head, because the county party secretary hasn't slept for days and nights and is sleeping now. Later, the county head takes everyone to find the county party secretary, but when they push open the door, the person who was sleeping has vanished without a trace. It turns out that the secretary has rushed to Qinglong Mountain! The characters' eagerness to find the county party secretary infects the audience. Although the county party secretary hasn't appeared yet, he has already occupied a place in our minds, and we, like the characters in the play, eagerly hope to see him. Finally, he appears, standing on a high mountain, discussing water conservancy matters with others. Then, this energetic person begins to move around in front of us. He tirelessly works with the masses on water conservancy, experimental high-yield fields, and iron smelting... For the sake of the collective, he forgets about himself, even neglecting to see his wife's newborn twins. He lives with the masses so closely and harmoniously, like a fish in water! Our party's leaders share weal and woe with the masses and appear as ordinary laborers, which is movingly reflected in him.
    Some of the plot handling in the film is quite vivid and interesting, such as the locomobile boiler in front of the county party committee, which the heads of the agricultural cooperatives are all vying for. But later, everyone discovers that the machine has disappeared. Where did it go? Then, a scene appears on the screen where many people are happily carrying the machine. It turns out that people from another cooperative carried it away. Here, the staging is not only concise and neat, but also the humorous dialogue, the magnificent songs of the people carrying the machine, and the picturesque mountain scenery in the background are all moving. And through the activities of the county party secretary, the film also shows the situation before the rural areas entered the people's communes and the need to establish people's communes, reflecting a fairly wide range of aspects. However, in this regard, because it touches on many things, it can only scratch the surface. Some things are even only generally recorded, without being subjected to a high degree of artistic generalization and concentration, and without being organically combined with the characters' activities, so the characters' personalities cannot be displayed more deeply and vividly.

    和群众同甘共苦的人
    高枝
    从“县委书记”这个题名就可以想见，这部影片一定是以一位县委书记为主角的；不过影片并没有开门见山的把这位主人公推到我们面前，而是用了曲笔从侧面来写的：许多人都要找县委书记，但却被县长挡架了，因为县委书记已经有几天几夜没有睡觉，现在正睡着哩。后来县长带着大家去找县委书记，但推开门一看，睡着的人却已杳如黄鹤，原来书记已经奔上青龙山了！剧中人急于找县委书记的心情感染了观众，虽然县委书记还没有出现，但他在我们心目中，已经占据了一席地位，我们也同剧中人一样，迫切希望看到他。终于，他出现了，正站在高高的山上，和别人谈论着修水利的事情。而接着，这个生龙活虎的人便在我们面前活动起来了。他毫不倦怠地同群众一块搞水利，一块搞丰产试验田，一块炼铁……为了集体，忘了个人，他甚至连爱人初生的一对双胞胎也顾不上去看看。他那样亲切融洽地和群众生活在一起，真是如鱼得水！我们党的领导者是和群众同甘共苦的，是以普通劳动者的姿态出现的，这在他身上得到相当动人的体现。
    影片有些情节处理颇为生动有趣，譬如县委会门口的一架锅驼机，农业社主任们都争着要，但后来大家发现这架机器却不翼而飞了。哪去了呢？接着银幕上出现了一个画面，许多人正兴高彩烈地抬着那架机器，原来另一个社的人把它抬走了。这里场面调度不仅简洁利落，而且那富于风趣的对话，那抬机器的人的雄壮的歌声，以及那作为背景的风光如画的山野，都很动人。而通过县委书记的活动，影片也表现了农村进入人民公社前的情景和成立人民公社的需要，反映的面是相当广的。不过在这方面，因为接触的事物较多，只能浮光掠影，有些事物甚至只作了一般性的记录，没有经过高度的艺术概括与集中，没有和人物的活动有机地结合起来，因此还不能使人物的性格更加深刻鲜明地展示出来。
