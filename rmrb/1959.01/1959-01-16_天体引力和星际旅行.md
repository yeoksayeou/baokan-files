    Celestial Gravity and Interstellar Travel
    Ke Xie
    From Aristotle to Newton
    Long ago, people knew that everything could not leave the ground. Whether an arrow is shot into the sky, a stone is thrown into the distance, or one jumps vigorously from the ground, sooner or later they will fall back to the ground. The Greek philosopher Aristotle gave a idealistic explanation of these phenomena. He said that this was because these things had a "love" for the earth, those who loved it strongly were heavy, and those who loved it lightly were light. He also drew a wrong inference from this: if two balls with a weight difference of one time fell at the same time, the one with a weight of one time would be one time faster.
    Three or four hundred years ago, the people of the West carried out fierce struggles against feudal rule, and natural science also participated in this battle. Italian scientist Galileo proved with his famous Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment that balls of different weights fall at the same time, overturning Aristotle's dogma that had ruled for more than a thousand years. Galileo also systematically analyzed free-fall motion and the parabolic motion of projectiles based on experiments. Galileo and the later German scientist Kepler also carefully studied the movements of planets and satellites based on Copernicus's heliocentric theory; in particular, Kepler devoted his life to studying planetary orbits and made precise calculations. Kepler and some later astronomers also guessed that planets revolved around the sun because they were attracted by the sun. However, none of them combined this conjecture with observed facts to develop it into a rigorous scientific theory.
    On the road paved by these scientific predecessors, British scientist Newton established his theory of gravity. He gave a scientific explanation of the movement of all falling objects and projectiles. He said that this was due to the earth's gravity. Moreover, he expanded the earth's gravity to hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from the ground. He believed that the reason why the moon can revolve around the earth at a speed of more than one kilometer per second without flying away is because there is an invisible rope—the earth's gravity—holding it.
        We live in a world of gravity
    Newton also extended this gravity to everything. He believed that there is gravity between all objects, which is universal gravitation; the magnitude of the gravity is directly proportional to the mass of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. For example, if a lead ball is cut in half, then the mass of half a ball is only half that of the whole ball, and the gravity it receives from the earth is only half as great. If the lead ball is moved to a place twice as far from the center of the earth, then the gravity will be reduced to one over the square of two (1/22), that is, reduced to a quarter; at a place three times as far from the center of the earth, the gravity will be reduced to one over the square of three (1/32), that is, reduced to one-ninth. Here, let me add a note about the difference between mass and weight. The so-called weight refers to the earth's gravity, which changes with the distance of the object from the center of the earth and its position on the ground; mass refers to the amount of matter contained in an object, and the mass of the object should be the same no matter where it is.
    Since we live in a world of gravity, the surrounding tables, chairs, walls, ceilings, and floors are all attracting us. But why don't we feel it at all? This is because these gravities are very small. The gravity between two large lead balls weighing one thousand kilograms each, one meter apart, is far less than the pulling force of an ant. However, sensitive instruments can be used to measure this gravity. As for objects with huge mass, such as the earth, the sun, and the moon, their gravity on surrounding objects is very large. The gravity between them is even greater. According to calculations, the average gravity between the earth and the moon is 20 million trillion tons, and the average gravity between the sun and the earth is 170 times this gravity.
    Newton used this law of universal gravitation to analyze the movement of planets and moons, calculated their orbits, and laid the foundation for celestial mechanics. He also calculated the first cosmic velocity of eight kilometers per second and the second cosmic velocity of eleven point two kilometers per second. However, at that time, the fastest means of transportation people could drive was a four-horse carriage, which was far from this speed. Therefore, for more than two hundred years thereafter, people believed that this speed should only exist in the sky, and it was difficult to achieve on earth; interstellar travel away from the earth was only a subject for science fiction novels written by writers such as Verne, and scientists did not care about it.
        Human struggle to overcome celestial gravity
    However, people are unwilling and will not be slaves to gravity. People try every means to go to the sky. People got on balloons and airships, using the buoyancy of air to overcome the earth's gravity and rise to an altitude of several kilometers; people also drove airplanes, using the impact of airflow on the wings to overcome the earth's gravity and freely navigate in the air. However, these flying tools cannot be separated from the air. They cannot enable people to break through the atmosphere and move away from the ground.
    Tsiolkovsky devoted his life to the lofty ideal of interstellar travel. He established interstellar travel on a scientific basis, established a complete theory of using rockets to fly out of the earth, and also depicted the simple structure of modern rockets. Since then, due to the emergence of modern rockets that can fly hundreds of kilometers, the ideal of interstellar travel has gradually approached reality, and many scientists are specifically planning this matter. Finally, the Soviet Union's red giants flew into the sky one by one, and the red space rocket also began its endless voyage. People have obtained the first and second cosmic velocities, completely overcoming the earth's gravity, and taken the first and second steps on the road to conquering the universe.
    However, people's struggle with gravity will continue. Rockets with the second cosmic velocity, after moving away from the earth and thus breaking free from the earth's gravity, will still become a new planet in the solar system, moving in a certain orbit under the control of the sun's gravity. If you want to make the rocket farther away from the sun, you have to increase the orbital speed or change the direction of travel to orbit a larger or flatter ellipse; if you want to make the rocket closer to the sun, you have to reduce the orbital speed or change the direction of travel to orbit a smaller and flatter ellipse. Without changing the speed and direction of travel, these requirements cannot be met, and it can only travel according to the original orbit.
    Therefore, if people want to go to Venus or Mars, they must strictly control the direction and speed of launch so that the rocket's orbit around the sun can extend to the orbits of Venus or Mars. It is also necessary to strictly select the launch date and time so that when the rocket reaches the orbits of Venus or Mars, these stars also happen to pass there. Moreover, when turning from Venus or Mars back to the earth's orbit, the earth has already turned to another place, and it is difficult to encounter it again by chance. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a suitable time on Venus or Mars to fly back, or after completing the inspection mission around them, adjust the speed and follow a new orbit back to Earth. The control of this return route must be even stricter, otherwise if the timing is missed or the route deviates, the rocket will pass the Earth by more than hundreds of thousands of kilometers, and then it will be difficult to select an orbit to catch up with the Earth again in a short time. In order to ensure the safety of interstellar travel, the rocket must carry a lot of fuel to prepare to adjust its speed and fight against the sun's gravity.
        The rocket speed must be increased to near the speed of light
    To fly out of the solar system, it takes even more effort to overcome the sun's gravity. The sun's mass is too large, and even Pluto, which is 5.9 billion kilometers away, must move under the control of the sun's gravity. Therefore, to fly out of the Earth's orbit, it must have a speed of 42.3 kilometers per second, which is a very high speed. However, as long as the direction of rocket launch is the same as the direction of the Earth's orbit, and it has an initial velocity of 16.7 kilometers per second, then after overcoming the Earth's gravity, it still retains a speed of 12.5 kilometers per second; as long as this speed is added to the Earth's orbital speed of 29.8 kilometers per second, then it will obtain a speed of 42.3 kilometers per second to leave the solar system.
    The energy required for a rocket with a speed of 16.7 kilometers per second is 2.1 times that of a rocket with a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, and at least two more stages of rockets must be added. This is technically quite difficult. However, Soviet scientists believe that it is possible to launch a rocket that escapes the solar system from the ground using only chemical fuels without using nuclear fuels. Therefore, we believe that in a short period of time, people will hear the news of this greater victory in the march to the universe again.
    After people leave the solar system, will they no longer be affected by gravity? It is not like that either. We know that the sun and the solar system are part of the Milky Way, and the entire Milky Way is composed of countless stars; under their own gravitational force, the Milky Way rotates around its center. Those close to the center rotate faster, and those far from the center rotate slower. The sun is located on the edge of the Milky Way, and it revolves around the center of the Milky Way at a speed of 250 kilometers per second. Because the sun is too far from the center of the Milky Way, it takes 180 million years to make a circle, so the sun's orbit is almost a straight line. After the rocket leaves the solar system, it must also revolve around the center of the Milky Way at a speed similar to that of the solar system and in a certain orbit. If you want to change the rocket's orbit, you have to change its speed. However, since the gravity the rocket receives at this time is only a few billionths of the gravity it receives on the ground, its flight is relatively free. However, when traveling in interstellar space, a more important factor to consider is "distance." The stars outside the solar system are too far away from us, and it takes 4.2 years to get from the nearest star to here, even if using light that travels 300,000 kilometers per second. If a rocket leaves the solar system and can accelerate to 20 kilometers per second, it will take 60,000 to 70,000 years to reach this star. Moreover, since this star is also moving, the above speed may never catch up with it. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the rocket speed to near the speed of light, which cannot be achieved by using chemical fuels or general nuclear fuels, but by using a newer type of rocket, such as a rocket that can radiate photons backward (a particle that travels at the speed of light, which makes up what we usually call light), which is a photon rocket. Many people doubt the possibility of photon rockets, just as many people doubted the possibility of interstellar travel in the past. Some Soviet scientists predict that in more than a hundred years, human photon rockets will eventually fly into the sky.
        The essence of gravity remains to be studied
    Speaking of which, some people may raise this question: why do objects attract each other? Newton did not further explore and solve this essential question of gravity. He said: "It is enough to point out that gravity exists in fact." Therefore, Engels said that Newton's universal gravitation did not explain but only depicted the current state of planetary motion.
    Of course, people will not shrink back from this problem, and many theories of gravity have been put forward. Among them, German scientist Einstein's theory of gravity is more famous. He believes that the nature of space changes with the surrounding material bodies. In the vicinity of material bodies with relatively large mass, such as planets and stars, space is curved, no longer a symmetrical space in all directions, but a curved space (the geometry of studying this curved space is called Lobachevskian geometry, which is different from the Euclidean geometry we are familiar with). Therefore, objects will move in curves in this space, rather than in straight lines, just as if they were subjected to an external force. In addition, some scientists have recently proposed a new theory of gravity, believing that gravity is a wave, similar to electromagnetic waves, which is transmitted from one object to another, thus making the objects attract each other, and when the object is cooled to 273.16 degrees Celsius below zero (scientifically called absolute zero), it will no longer emit this wave, and therefore will not be affected by gravity. If this theory is true, then people can cool the rocket shell to absolute zero and fly into the sky without the effect of gravity. This bold theory remains to be confirmed. However, we can be sure that the study of the essence of gravity can not only increase our understanding of the universe, but also help us complete the lofty task of conquering the universe.

    天体引力和星际旅行
    克谐
    从亚里士多德到牛顿
    很久以前，人们就知道，一切东西都不能离开地面。把箭射向天空，把石头抛向远处，或者使劲从地面上跳起来，迟早都将落回地面。希腊哲学家亚里士多德对这些现象，作了唯心论的解释。他说这是由于这些东西对地球的“爱好”，爱得强烈些的就重，爱得淡薄些的就轻。他还由此得出一个错误的推论：轻重差一倍的球同时落下，重一倍的球要快一倍。
    到了三四百年前，西方的人们对封建统治进行了激烈斗争，自然科学也参加了这场战斗。意大利科学家伽利略，以他著名的比萨斜塔实验，证明轻重不同的球同时落下，推翻了亚里士多德的统治了千余年的教条。伽利略还以实验为基础，系统地分析了自由落体运动和抛射体的抛物线运动。伽利略以及稍后的德国科学家开普勒，还以哥白尼的太阳系理论为基础，仔细地研究了行星和卫星的运动；特别是开普勒用毕生精力对行星轨道进行了研究，并作了精确的计算。开普勒和稍后的一些天文学家，也都猜想过，行星是由于受到了太阳的吸引才绕太阳转动的。可是，他们都没有把这种猜想结合观测到的事实，发展成为严谨的科学理论。
    在这些科学先辈铺设的道上，英国科学家牛顿建立了他的引力理论。他对一切落体和抛射体的运动，作了科学的解释。他说这是由于地球的引力。并且，他把地球引力扩大到远离地面几十万公里之外。他认为月球所以能以每秒一公里多的速度绕地球转动而不远飞，就是因为有一条不可见的绳索——地球引力拉住它。
        我们生活在引力的世界里
    牛顿还把这引力扩充到一切物体中间。他认为一切物体之间都有引力，这就是万有引力；引力的大小和物体的质量成正比，和物体之间的距离的平方成反比。例如，如果把一个铅球切成两半，那末半个球的质量只有整个球的一半，它受到地球的引力，也只有原来的一半大。如果把铅球移到离地心两倍远的地方，那末引力要减到二的平方分之一
  （1／22）即减到四分之一；在离地心三倍远的地方，引力要减到三的平方分之一（1／32），即减到九分之一。在这里，附带地说明一下质量和重量的区别。所谓重量是指地球的引力，它是随着物体离地心的远近，和在地面上的位置而变动的；质量是指物体所含的物质的量，不论在什么地方，物体的质量应该是一样多的。
    我们既然生活在引力的世界里，周围的桌、椅、墙、天花板和地板都在吸引我们。但是，为什么我们丝毫也感觉不到呢？这是由于这些引力都是非常小的缘故。两个相距一公尺的一千公斤重的大铅球，它们之间的引力远抵不上蚂蚁的拉力。可是，利用灵敏的仪器可以测出这种引力。至于质量巨大的物体，像地球、太阳和月球等，对周围物体的引力就很大了。它们互相之间的引力就更大了。据计算，地球和月亮间的平均引力是二千万亿吨，而太阳和地球间的平均引力是这个引力的一百七十倍。
    牛顿利用这条万有引力定律，分析了行星和月亮的运动，计算了它们的轨道，给天体力学打下了基础。他还计算出每秒八公里的第一宇宙速度和每秒十一点二公里的第二宇宙速度。但是，当时人们能驾驶的最快的交通工具，不过是四匹马拉的车子，离这个速度太远了。因此，在以后的两百多年间，人们都认为这个速度只应天上有，人间是很难做到的；离开地球作星际旅行，也只是文学家如凡尔纳等写幻想小说的题材，科学家是不过问的。
        人类克服天体引力的斗争
    可是，人们不愿也不会做引力的奴隶。人们千方百计地要到天上去。人们坐上了气球和飞艇，利用空气的浮力，战胜了地球引力，上升到几公里以上的高空；人们还驾起飞机，利用空气流对机翼的冲击，战胜了地球引力，自由地航行于空中。但是，这些飞行工具都离不开空气。都不能使人们冲破大气层，远离地面。
    齐奥尔科夫斯基把一生都献给星际旅行这个崇高的理想。他把星际旅行建立在科学的基础上，建立了利用火箭飞出地球外的整套理论，也描绘了现代火箭的简单构造。此后，由于能远飞几百公里的现代火箭的出现，星际旅行的理想逐渐接近现实，许多科学家都在具体地规划这件事了。终于，苏联的红色巨星一个一个飞上天，红色宇宙火箭也开始它的永不休止的航行。人们获得了第一和第二宇宙速度，彻底战胜了地球引力，在征服宇宙的道路上，走出了第一步和第二步。
    但是，人们和引力的斗争还要继续下去。具有第二宇宙速度的火箭，在远离地球从而摆脱地球引力束缚之后，仍将成为太阳系的一颗新行星，在太阳引力的支配下，循一定的轨道运行。如果想使火箭离太阳更远一些，那就得增加轨道速度或改变运行方向绕一个更大或更扁的椭圆；如果想使火箭离太阳更近一些，那就得减低轨道速度或改变运行方向，绕一个较小较扁的椭圆。不改变速度的大小和运行的方向，就不能达到这些要求，而只好按着原定的轨道运行。
    因此，人们要到金星或火星上去，就要严格控制发射的方向和速度，使火箭绕日的轨道，能延伸到金星或火星的轨道上。还要严格地选定发射日子和时刻，使火箭到达金星或火星轨道时，这些星也正好通过那里。并且，从金星或火星那儿转回到地球轨道上时，地球早已转到别的地方去了，很难凑巧又遇到。因此，需要在金星或火星上选个合适时刻再飞回来，或者在绕过它们完成考察任务后，就调整速度，循一条新的轨道回地球来。对这条回家的航线要控制得更严格，否则要是误了点，或者路线出了偏差，火箭在几十万公里以外擦地球而过，那时再要选一条轨道在短时间内赶回地球，就难了。为了确保星际旅行的安全，火箭上要带很多燃料，准备调整速度，跟太阳引力作斗争。
        要把火箭的速度提高到接近光的速度
    要飞出太阳系以外，就得花更大力量克服太阳引力。太阳的质量太大了，远在五十九亿公里以外的冥王星，也得在太阳引力支配下运动。因此，要从地球轨道上飞出去，得具有每秒四十二点三公里的速度才行，这是一个很大的速度。但是，只要火箭发射的方向和地球运行的方向一致，并具有每秒十六点七公里的初速，那末在克服地球引力后，它还留有每秒十二点五公里速度；只要把这个速度加到地球运行的速度每秒二十九点八公里上，那末它就获得离开太阳系的每秒四十二点三公里的速度了。
    火箭具有每秒十六点七公里的速度，所需的能量是速度为每秒十一点二公里的火箭的二点一倍，而且至少要再增加两级火箭才行。这在技术上是相当困难的。可是，苏联科学家认为，不需要利用核子燃料，只利用化学燃料，就有可能从地面上发射脱离太阳系的火箭。因此，我们相信，在不长的时间内，人们又会听到这个向宇宙进军获得更大胜利的消息。
    人们离开了太阳系以后，是否就再也不受引力的作用呢？也不是这样。我们知道，太阳和太阳系都是银河系的一部分，整个银河系由无数个恒星构成；在它们自身的引力作用下，银河系绕着自己的中心转动。离中心近的转得快，离中心远的转得慢。太阳位于银河系的边缘，它以每秒二百五十公里的速度绕银河系中心运行。由于太阳离银河系中心太远了，要一亿八千万年才转一圈，所以太阳的运行差不多是条直线。当火箭脱离太阳系以后，它也要以和太阳系差不多的速度，循一定的轨道绕银河系中心转动。如果要改变火箭的运行轨道，也得改变它的速度。可是，由于这时火箭受到的引力，只有它在地面上时受到的引力的几十亿分之一，所以它的飞行就比较自由。不过，在恒星际旅行时，要考虑一个更重要的因素，就是“距离”。太阳系以外的恒星离我们太远了，从最近的一颗恒星到我们这儿，即使利用每秒钟跑三十万公里的光，也得四点二年。火箭离开太阳系后如能加速到每秒二十公里，到达这颗恒星，也要六、七万年。而且由于这颗恒星也在运动，上面这个速度可能永远赶不上它。因此，需要把火箭速度提高到接近光的速度，这就不是利用化学燃料或一般的核子燃料能够达到，而要利用一种更新式的火箭，如能够向后辐射光子（以光速前进的一种粒子，它们组成了我们通常所说的光线）的火箭，这就是光子火箭。很多人怀疑光子火箭的可能性，就如过去很多人怀疑星际旅行的可能性一样。苏联的一些科学家预言，在一百多年以后，人类的光子火箭终将飞上天空。
        引力的本质问题还待研究
    谈到这里，可能有人会提出这样一个问题：为什么物体会互相吸引呢？对这个引力的本质问题，牛顿没有作进一步的探索和解决。他说：“只要指出事实上引力是存在的，也就够了。”因此，恩格斯说，牛顿的万有引力没有说明而只描画出行星运动的现状。
    当然，人们是不会在这个问题前退缩的，很多种的引力理论提出来了。其中以德国科学家爱因斯坦的引力理论比较著名。他认为，空间的性质是随着周围的物质体而变化的。在质量比较大的物质体像行星和恒星的附近，空间弯曲了，不再是四面八方很匀称的空间，而是弯曲了的空间（研究这种弯曲的空间的几何学叫做罗巴切夫斯基几何学，和我们熟悉的欧几里得几何学不同）。因此，物体在这空间将循曲线运动，而不再循直线运动，就像它受到了外力一样。此外，一些科学家在最近还提出了新的引力学说，认为引力是一种波，就和电磁波相仿，从一个物体传到另一个物体，因而使物体互相吸引，而物体冷到摄氏零下273.16度（科学上叫做绝对零度）时，它就不再发出这种波，因而也就不受引力的作用了。如果这种理论是确实的，那末人们就可以把火箭壳冷到绝对零度，在没有引力的作用下，飞向天空。这个大胆的理论还有待证实。但是，我们可以肯定，关于引力本质的研究，不仅可以增进我们对宇宙的认识，也可以帮助我们完成征服宇宙的崇高任务。
