    Seething with Enthusiasm
    Liu Di

    Although it is still early spring, if you travel around and take a look at the factories and rural areas leaping forward, you will immediately feel: our country is seething with enthusiasm and is thriving everywhere.

    In the factories, a production upsurge centered on technological innovation is surging and rising vigorously. In the vast rural areas, boundless land has been deeply plowed, water conservancy projects are being built in full swing, and the manure accumulation campaign is accumulating strength for even greater harvests. All this tells people: the prelude to an even greater high tide of industrial and agricultural production in 1959 has already begun.

    Seething with enthusiasm is truly invaluable for revolutionaries and revolutionary causes. The Great Leap Forward of the past year has brought us many valuable experiences. These experiences can be summarized into thousands of points, but the most important one is probably this precious enthusiasm. The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction has ignited the people's vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and inspired the people's soaring revolutionary drive. People are full of enthusiasm, spirited, daring to think and act, overcoming countless difficulties, and creating countless miracles. All tasks are being carried out vigorously and are changing with each passing day. One upsurge follows another, one leap forward follows another. In the midst of the high tide, the war drums are booming throughout the country, everything is red, and everything is full of enthusiasm. This high enthusiasm has generated enormous power, and this enormous power has promoted even greater leaps forward. It was in this kind of enthusiasm that 10.7 million tons of steel were produced, 750 billion jin of grain were harvested, and 270 million tons of coal were mined... Conservatism, superstition, negativity, and inferiority were all swept away by this surge of enthusiasm. The victory of 1958 appeared before us under the evaporation of this enthusiasm.

    We advocate seething with enthusiasm, and the reason is very simple. Revolutionaries cannot be without revolutionary enthusiasm, just as steam engines cannot be without a heat source, and life cannot be without sunshine and fire. Steam engines without a heat source lose their power and cannot operate; people cannot survive without sunshine and fire; what power do revolutionaries rely on to realize a great ideal without revolutionary enthusiasm? Revolutionaries have always been hot, never cold. This "heat" does not refer to anything else, but to firm confidence in the revolutionary cause, abundant enthusiasm, selfless labor, and active support for new things. Every revolutionary can only be enthusiastic, not cold-hearted. They can only be enthusiastic about the revolutionary cause, and the higher the enthusiasm, the better. Moreover, this enthusiasm must be consistent. Under any difficult and arduous circumstances, revolutionary enthusiasm will never diminish. Even if it is just a spark, it will start a prairie fire, let alone the raging fire we ignited during the Great Leap Forward, which has already "burned" out a great victory? While seeing the achievements of last year, we should also pay attention to applying the successful experiences of achieving those achievements to our future work. Let us press on and advance victoriously. In 1958, we were seething with enthusiasm; in 1959, we need even greater enthusiasm, muster even greater drive, break superstitions, oppose conservatism, dare to think and act, and achieve even greater leaps forward. Without soaring drive, where will the greater leap forward come from?

  Of course, we also advocate a calm scientific analysis of everything, but we have always opposed a cold attitude towards the revolutionary cause. Being cold as ice towards the revolutionary cause and taking a calm analysis of things are two completely different things. Our fundamental difference with the tide-watching conservatives lies here. During the Great Leap Forward, the tide-watchers watched coldly, made cynical remarks, and the abacus in the hands of the bean counters clicked non-stop, but in the end, they lost everything. Recently, these cold-hearted people have tried to use excuses to deny their debts. They say: The Great Leap Forward of 1958 was too hot, and this year it should be cooled down a bit. It is natural for cold-hearted people to have some wonderful theories when talking about heat. In fact, they don't even understand what is cold and what is hot! They are accustomed to observing new things with a cold attitude, so it is difficult not to be cold and sarcastic.

    Seething with enthusiasm is always the most valuable thing for our cause. After correctly understanding the relationship between cold and heat, we will radiate more heat and greater light.

    热气腾腾
    柳笛
    现在虽然还是早春，可是如果到各地走走，看一看飞跃前进的工厂和农村，就会立刻感到：我们的国家到处热气腾腾，蒸蒸日上。
    在工厂里，一个以技术改革为中心的生产热潮，正在汹涌澎湃地高涨起来。广大的农村里，辽阔无际的土地被深翻了起来，水利工程在轰轰烈烈地兴建着，积肥热潮正在为更大的丰收蕴藏着力量。这一切都告诉人们：1959年更大的工农业生产高潮已经揭开了序幕。
    热气腾腾，对于革命者和革命事业说来，真是无价之宝。去年一年来的大跃进，带给了我们许多宝贵的经验，这许多经验，真可以总结出上千条来，其中最主要的，恐怕就是这可贵的热气。党的社会主义建设总路线点燃了人民群众旺盛的革命热情，鼓起了人民群众冲天的革命干劲。人们热情澎湃，意气风发，敢想敢干，克服了无数的困难，创造了无数的奇迹。各项工作轰轰烈烈，日新月异，一个热潮接着一个热潮，一个跃进跟着一个跃进。高潮之中，全国战鼓咚咚，一片火红，一团热气。这高昂的热气产生了巨大的力量，巨大的力量又推动了更大的跃进。就在这种热气中，一千零七十万吨钢水出炉了，七千五百亿斤粮食收到手了，二亿七千万吨煤炭挖掘出来了……，保守、迷信、消极、自卑，通通被这一股子热劲冲到九霄云外去了。1958年的胜利，就是在这种热气蒸发之下出现在我们的面前。
    我们提倡热气腾腾，这个道理很简单。革命者不能没有革命热情，就如同蒸汽机不能没有热源，生活中不能没有阳光和火一样。蒸汽机没有热源，失掉了动力，不能开动，人们离开了阳光和火种，不能生存；革命者缺乏革命热情，凭什么力量去实现一个伟大的理想？革命者从来就是热的而决不是冷的。这种“热”，不是指的别的什么，乃是对革命事业坚定的信心，充沛的热情，忘我的劳动，对新生事物的积极扶持。每一个革命者只能做热心家，不能做冷心家，对于革命事业只许热，热气越来越高，越热越好。而且，这股子热劲要始终如一，在任何困难和艰苦的情况下，革命热情永不减退，那怕是星星之火，也要燎原，何况是大跃进中我们燃起的熊熊大火，已经“燎”出了一个伟大的胜利呢？我们在看到去年的成绩的时候，同时应该注意到把取得成绩的成功经验运用到今后的工作中去。一鼓作气，乘胜前进。1958年，热气腾腾；1959年，需要更大的热气腾腾，鼓起更大的干劲，破迷信、反保守，敢想敢干，实现更大的跃进。没有冲天的干劲，更大的跃进从何而来？
  当然，我们也主张对一切事情采取冷静的科学分析，但我们从来都反对那种对待革命事业的冷淡态度。对革命事业冷若冰霜和对事物采取冷静的分析，截然是两回事。我们和观潮派保守主义者的根本分歧，就在这里。大跃进中，观潮派冷眼旁观，冷嘲热讽，算账派手中的算盘也笃笃作响，算个不停，但是到头来他们输了个一干二净。最近以来，这些冷心家们又想借口赖账了。他们说：1958年的大跃进太热了，今年应该冷一下。冷心家谈热，自然有些妙论。其实，他们何尝懂得什么是冷，什么是热！他们惯于用冷淡的态度去观察新的事物，当然就很难不冷言冷语、冷气飕飕了。
    热气腾腾，对我们的事业永远是最值得珍贵的。正确地认识了冷和热的关系之后，我们的身上会散发出更多的热和更大的光。
