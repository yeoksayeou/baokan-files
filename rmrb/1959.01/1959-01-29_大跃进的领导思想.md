The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, in a recent telephone conference, when discussing the need to focus on steel production as the center of the entire industrial production effort, requested that Party Committee Secretaries at the prefectural and municipal levels, and other leaders at all levels, establish a leadership ideology of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end." This is the leadership ideology to ensure an all-round Great Leap Forward. Not only should the steel production departments establish this leadership ideology, but also the machinery, coal, electricity, transportation, and light industry departments should also establish this leadership ideology.

Our industry is based on planned production. The annual targets are evenly distributed across each month, and each month's targets are evenly distributed across each production day. The plan must be completed. If we do less today, we must do more tomorrow; if we do less this month, we must do more next month; if we do less in the first half of the year, we must do more in the second half of the year. Anyway, if there is slackness at the beginning, there will inevitably be pressure later. If we grasp tightly from the beginning and grasp tightly at all times, we can ensure that the plan is completed on a monthly and quarterly basis, and guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the Great Leap Forward targets. If we hold the attitude of "If we can't finish it today, there's always tomorrow," and don't grasp tightly at the beginning, being loose and slack, then the tasks will accumulate, and we will become passive at the end of the month, quarter, or year. This will not only affect the completion of the plan for the current month, quarter, and year, but also affect production in the next month, quarter, and year. Slackness at the beginning forces pressure later, and pressure later creates new slackness at the beginning. Slackness at the beginning and pressure later, pressure later and slackness at the beginning, influence each other, causing production to remain in an abnormal state.

The reason why leaders must grasp tightly is to quickly resolve various contradictions and overcome various difficulties in production. Contradictions not only exist in all things, but also run through the entire process of the development of all things. When old contradictions are overcome, new contradictions arise. Taking industrial production as an example, when old weak links are strengthened, new weak links will appear; when old erroneous ideas among the masses are overcome, new erroneous ideas will emerge. These new weak links and new erroneous ideas need to be resolved in a timely manner, otherwise they will hinder production. Therefore, to "grasp tightly" means that we cannot start without finishing, or start strong and finish weak, nor can we grasp for a while and then relax for a while, like suffering from malaria. Instead, we must grasp tightly from beginning to end, at all times.

To grasp tightly, we must also grasp fiercely and grasp comprehensively. "Fiercely" means truly solving the problem, not just scratching the surface or issuing general calls. "Comprehensively" means not being one-sided, helping one thing at the expense of another. Grasping without tightening, grasping without ferocity, and grasping without comprehensiveness is equivalent to not grasping at all. In complex industrial production, there are many problems. To grasp "comprehensively" does not mean failing to distinguish between important and urgent matters and grabbing everything at once. Rather, it means distinguishing between major and minor problems, grasping the major ones, and driving the minor ones. Taking the current situation as an example, the first thing to grasp is mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate advanced planning targets, develop reliable technical and organizational measures, launch technical revolution movements, establish necessary rules and regulations, and combine hard work with smart work to ensure an all-round Great Leap Forward in production.

Grasping tightly from beginning to end is not simple. Because this is not only a matter of leadership methods, but also a matter of leadership ideology. Therefore, to grasp tightly from beginning to end, leaders must have soaring drive and a calm mind. They must go deep into reality, make a comprehensive analysis of objective conditions, and have foresight about the development of things. They must strategically despise difficulties, while tactically valuing difficulties. They must not only focus on the theoretical but also on the practical, and quickly solve specific problems one by one. Only in this way can we truly achieve grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end.

    大跃进的领导思想
    王朴
    四川省委在最近召开的一次电话会议上，讲到要抓紧以钢材为中心的整个工业生产的时候，要求地委、市委等各级领导同志，要确立“一开头就抓紧，自始至终抓紧”的领导思想。这是保证全面大跃进的领导思想。不只钢铁生产部门要确立这种领导思想，机械、煤炭、电力、交通，以及轻工业等所有生产部门，也都要确立这种领导思想。
    我们的工业是按照计划生产的。一年的指标均匀地分配在每个月，每个月的指标又均匀地分配在每一个生产日里。计划是必须完成的。今天做少了，明天就得多做；这个月做少了，下个月就得多做；上半年做少了，下半年就得多做。反正有前松，就必有后紧。一开头就抓紧，时时都抓紧，就可以保证计划如月如季地完成。保证完成和超额完成大跃进的指标。要是抱着“今天完不了，还有明天”的态度，开始抓得不紧，松松懈懈的，那么，任务越拉越多，到了月末季末或者年末就被动了。不仅影响当月、当季、当年计划的完成，而且还影响到下一月、下一季、下一年的生产。前松逼出后紧，后紧又造成新的前松。前松后紧，后紧前松，互相影响，使生产老陷于不正常状态。
    领导要抓得紧，为的是迅速解决生产中的各种矛盾，克服各种困难。矛盾不仅存在于一切事物，而且贯串一切事物的发展整个过程。旧的矛盾克服了，新的矛盾又产生。拿工业生产来说，旧的薄弱环节加强了，新的薄弱环节又会出现；群众中旧的错误思想克服了，新的错误思想又会冒出来。这些新的薄弱环节、新的错误思想，都需要及时解决，要不就会妨碍生产。所以，要“抓紧”，就既不能有头无尾，或者虎头蛇尾，也不能抓一阵，松一阵，像打疟疾一样，而必须自始至终的时时刻刻的都要抓紧。
    要抓紧，还必须抓得狠，抓得全。“狠”，就是真正解决问题，不能浮光掠影，泛泛号召一下就算数。“全”就是不要片面，扶东倒西。抓而不紧，抓而不狠，抓而不全，等于不抓。在复杂的工业生产中，问题很多，抓“全”，并不是不分轻重缓急，眉毛胡子一把抓，而是要分清主要问题和次要问题，抓住主要的，带动次要的。拿当前的情况来说，首先要抓的，就是发动群众讨论和制订先进的计划指标，订出可靠的技术措施和组织措施，开展技术革命运动，建立必要的规章制度，把苦干和巧干结合起来，保证生产全面大跃进。
    要自始至终都要抓紧，并不简单。因为这不仅是一个领导方法问题，也是一个领导思想问题。所以，要自始至终都要抓得紧，领导者必须要有冲天的干劲和冷静的头脑，要深入实际，对客观条件要作全面的分析，对事物的发展要有预见性，要在战略上藐视困难，同时在战术上重视困难。既要务虚更要务实，迅速地一个一个地解决具体问题。这样才能真正作到一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧。
