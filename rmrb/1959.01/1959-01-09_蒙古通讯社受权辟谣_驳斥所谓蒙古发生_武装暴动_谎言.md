Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 7th: The Mongolian News Agency is authorized to refute rumors:

    According to reports from Wellington, some newspapers in New Zealand published a statement by an official of the Taipei Chiang Kai-shek "government," insisting that an "armed rebellion" had occurred in the Mongolian People's Republic. Furthermore, they claimed that one of these rebellions was led by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic himself. This Chiang Kai-shek element insisted that these "rebellions" were suppressed by Soviet troops.

    The statement from the Mongolian News Agency said that the above statement by the Chiang Kai-shek element is a complete and utter fabrication, a malicious slander against the Mongolian People's Republic and the Mongolian people. The Mongolian people are more closely united than ever around the Party and the government, and under their leadership are building socialism in their country with full confidence.

    One cannot help but ask: Who needs to carry out such dirty slander against the Mongolian People's Republic, and what is their purpose in doing so? The only answer is that such fabrication and dissemination of malicious slander is only beneficial to those who, disregarding the will of peace-loving people of all countries, and contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of mankind, persist in the "cold war" policy and oppose the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems.

    蒙古通讯社受权辟谣
    驳斥所谓蒙古发生“武装暴动”谎言
    新华社乌兰巴托7日电　蒙古通讯社受权辟谣：
    据来自惠灵顿的消息说，新西兰的一些报纸刊载了台北蒋介石“政府”的一个官员所发表的谈话，硬说什么在蒙古人民共和国曾发生了“武装暴动”。而且，还说什么其中的一次暴动是由蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席本人领导的。这个蒋介石分子硬说，这些“暴动”被苏联军队镇压了。
    蒙古通讯社的这项声明说，蒋介石分子的上述说法是彻头彻尾的卑鄙捏造，是对蒙古人民共和国和蒙古人民进行恶毒的污蔑。蒙古人民正空前紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，并在它们的领导下满怀信心地在本国建设着社会主义。
    人们不禁要问：谁需要对蒙古人民共和国进行这种肮脏的污蔑，他们这样做是为了什么？唯一的回答是：这种捏造和散布恶毒谰言的做法只是有利于那样一些人，他们不顾各国爱好和平的人民的意志，违反绝大多数人类的愿望而坚持“冷战”政策，反对社会和政治制度不同的国家和平共处的原则。
