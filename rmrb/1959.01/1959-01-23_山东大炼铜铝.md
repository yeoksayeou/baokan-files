    Shandong Province, adapting to the needs of the iron and steel and machinery industries, is vigorously developing copper and aluminum production through both indigenous and modern methods. By the end of December 1958, according to incomplete statistics, the province had built more than 2,500 small, indigenous copper smelting furnaces, mined more than 149,000 tons of copper ore, and produced 59.3 tons of copper matte. Alumina production is also being mechanized, and preliminary trials using indigenous methods such as the "lime sintering method" and the "Glauber's salt sintering method" for refining alumina have been successful. By the end of last December, more than 104,000 tons of aluminum oxide and 168,800 tons of aluminum hydroxide had been produced.
    In order to ascertain the situation of underground resources, various localities have launched mass activities of prospecting and reporting mineral deposits, “seeking treasures from high mountains and demanding minerals from the earth.” In the past year, 26 counties and cities have discovered copper and aluminum deposits, providing resources for vigorously developing mass copper and aluminum production.
    Indigenous copper smelting has developed from scratch. More than a dozen counties and cities, including Haiyang, Qixia, Rushan, Rongcheng, as well as Weifang and Yantai, have successfully refined copper using indigenous methods. Qixia and Haiyang counties, while vigorously developing iron and steel, produce 4,800 to 5,000 jin of copper matte per day. The Gaofeng People's Commune in Rizhao County uses four "pig snout" furnaces to refine copper, producing 960 jin per day. Indigenous methods for refining alumina have been successfully tested in Wangcun, Zibo, Yixian and other places.
    Shandong Province is actively preparing to build larger and medium-sized copper and aluminum factories and mines. A mechanized electrolytic aluminum production workshop was started in the second half of last year and will be able to produce electrolytic aluminum in large quantities this year.

    山东大炼铜铝
    据大众日报消息　山东省适应钢铁机电工业发展的需要，土洋并举大搞铜铝生产。到1958年12月底，据不完全的统计，全省已建成炼铜小土炉两千五百多座，开采铜矿石十四万九千多吨，共产冰铜五十九点三吨。氧化铝也在进行机械化生产，并已初步试用“石灰烧结法”和“芒硝烧结法”等土法炼氧化铝成功。到去年12月底，已生产铝氧十万四千多吨，氢氧化铝十六万八千八百多吨。
    为了弄清地下资源情况，各地都开展了向高山取宝向大地要矿的群众性查矿报矿活动。一年来，发现有铜铝矿的县市达二十六个，为大力开展群众性的铜铝生产提供了资源。
    土法炼铜，从无到有地发展起来了。全省已有海阳、栖霞、乳山、荣成以及潍坊、烟台等十多个县市用土法炼铜成功。栖霞和海阳两县在大搞钢铁的同时，日产冰铜达四千八百斤到五千斤；日照县高峰人民公社用四座猪嘴炉炼铜，日产九百六十斤。土法提炼氧化铝，在王村、淄博、峄县等地都已试验成功。
    山东省正在积极筹建较大型的和中小型的铜铝工厂和矿山。机械化生产电解铝的车间已在去年下半年施工兴建，今年就可以大量生产电解铝。
