Vigorously Increase Production of Vegetables, Meat, Fish, and Eggs
Ensure a Constant Supply of Green Vegetables Throughout the Year and Guarantee Supply During the Off-Season

The Hongxing First Branch of the Qiyi People's Commune in Shanghai County, formerly the Hongqiao Township, has 1,980 mu of cultivated land, mostly sandy loam and sandy dry soil. Apart from 150 mu for seed and feed fields, all of the remaining 1,608 mu suitable for vegetable cultivation are planted with vegetables. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the annual vegetable yield per mu reached 150 dan in 1958, an increase of 34.1% compared to 1957. The variety of vegetables has increased from 68 to 86 with the introduction of eighteen new varieties. More importantly, they have firmly established the idea of serving the city and have done an excellent job in ensuring a balanced supply of vegetables, guaranteeing the supply during the off-season.

Everything for Supplying the City

Whom do we serve? Do we serve the city, or do we serve money? This has always been the central point of the struggle between two roads in vegetable production in the suburbs of large cities. In previous years, January, February, August and September have always been the off-season for supply due to climatic conditions. Solving this problem is not only a technical issue but, more importantly, an ideological one. In these issues, the Hongxing First Branch has also been repeatedly struggling. The "money-first" advocates, represented by some wealthy middle peasants, believed that the state's planning and vegetable price controls were hindering the peasants' ability to act and were unwilling to produce according to the state plan or to serve the city. During the rectification movement, the poor peasants and the broad masses of commune members used the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and comparing before and after to criticize these people's capitalist ideas. Some said: Before liberation, low vegetable prices hurt farmers; if they could not sell their vegetables, they would rot in the fields and be dumped into the rivers. Now, who has ever seen vegetables being dumped? In 1957, when Shanghai's cabbages were concentrated on the market and could not be sold, the vegetable company tried to sell them to Shandong and Qinghai. Some said: Workers and peasants are brothers, flesh and blood; no one can do without the other. The medicines, machinery, pumps, and so on needed for vegetable production cannot be separated from the support of industry. Shouldn't we serve the city? ...

Through mass self-education, the idea of obeying the state plan and serving the city has been established, the enthusiasm has been boosted, and the know-how has been discovered. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members tried every means to overcome drought, high temperatures, and cold waves, and expanded the supply in the off-season. In August of last year, the production of twice-cooked chicken feathers increased by 1,500 dan, and the products were transported to the hands of urban residents. When the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day arrived, in order to enable the city people to eat enough vegetables to celebrate the festival, they not only rushed to harvest vegetables but also transported the vegetables used in the canteen to supply the city. They said: "We farmers have always eaten a lot of vegetables. Now we eat less and support our worker brothers and urban residents, so that everyone is happy and has more enthusiasm for production."

The Secret to Making the Off-Season Not So Off

The reason why the Hongxing First Branch was able to achieve evergreen vegetables and guaranteed supply in the off-season in 1958 was mainly that they grasped the three major measures for increasing production in production technology: water, fertilizer, and soil. In the winter of 1957, they launched a river-opening and fertilizer accumulation campaign, and also leveled land and improved more than 1,500 mu of soil. The land where beans and wheat used to fail is now fertile land where all kinds of vegetables can be grown.

In August and September, they also grasped the two major keys of fighting drought and high temperatures, and in January and February, they grasped the prevention of cold waves and frost, which enabled them to achieve remarkable results in vegetable production.

The Hongxing First Branch also adopted the method of planting water pit fields and intercropping to ensure the supply of vegetables in the off-season. Planting water pit fields was learned from Guangzhou. In 1958, they opened up 65 mu at once, thus increasing the off-season supply of 65,000 jin of vegetables.

"Eliminating Elevated Bare Land" is a new slogan. In 1958, spinach, celery, shepherd's purse, and other crops were intercropped under cowpea sheds and cucumber sheds. Long-term crops are intercropped with short-term crops, and short crops are planted inside tall ones, making full use of the front and rear gaps to grab and plant short-term crops, which also increased the output in the off-season. The commune also adopted measures such as advancing early crops and delaying late ones, selecting heat-resistant and cold-resistant varieties, and increasing new varieties, so that the supply in the off-season and peak season tended to be balanced. Flat cabbages and autumn cabbages can generally supply for nine months. Now, these two seasons of cabbages are divided into early and late stages. The early ones are brought forward even earlier, and the late ones are postponed even later. With this interweaving, three months are filled, so that cabbages can be on the market every month. In this way, the commune supplies cabbages, tomatoes, foreign potatoes, chives, green vegetables, etc. every month; and celery, shepherd's purse, spinach, radishes, and mushrooms, etc. are supplied every season.

Leap forward again and again. In 1959, the commune members said that they would further implement and study the technology for increasing production, comprehensively arrange production, increase the production of more vegetables, and better complete the task of balanced supply.

    大力增产菜肉鱼蛋
    蔬菜四季青　淡季保供应
    潘明沪
    上海县七一人民公社的东部原虹桥乡虹星一分社，共有耕地一千九百八十亩，多半是沙质壤土和沙干土，除了种子田和饲料田一百五十亩之外，其他能够种植蔬菜的一千六百零八亩都全部种植了蔬菜。在总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年每亩蔬菜年产量达一百五十担，比1957年增加了34.1％；蔬菜品种原有六十八种，又设法引进了十八个新品种。更重要的他们牢固地树立了为城市服务的思想，把蔬菜均衡供应工作做得非常出色，保证了淡季的蔬菜供应。
    一切为了供应城市
    为谁服务？为城市服务，还是为钞票服务？这一直是大城市郊区蔬菜生产中两条道路斗争的中心。历年来1、2月份、8、9月份因气候条件的关系，一直是供应上的淡季。解决这个问题不仅是个技术问题，而更重要的是思想问题。在这些问题上，虹星一分社也同样的在反复斗争着。以某些富裕中农为代表的“钞票论”者认为国家的计划、蔬菜的价格管理，是束缚农民手脚的，不愿意按国家计划生产，不愿意为城市服务。整风运动中，贫农和广大社员用摆事实、讲道理、前后对比的方法，批判了这些人的资本主义思想。有的说：解放前，菜贱伤农，种了菜卖不掉，烂在田里，倒在浜里，现在谁见过有蔬菜倒掉的？1957年上海市卷心菜上市集中，卖不掉，蔬菜公司就设法推销到山东、青海。有的说：工人、农民都是同蒂生，骨肉相连，谁也离不开谁。蔬菜生产所需要的药剂药械、抽水机等等都离不开工业的支援，我们难道还不该为城市服务吗？……
    经过群众的自我教育，服从国家计划、为城市服务的思想确立了，劲头也足了，窍门也有了。社员们在党支部的领导下，千方百计地战胜旱灾、高温和寒流，扩大了淡季供应量。去年8月份，光二熟鸡毛菜就增加了一千五百担，把产品运到了城市居民的手里。在中秋、国庆节日来到时，为了使城市人民能吃到足够的蔬菜欢度节日，不仅突击抢收蔬菜，而且把食堂里自用的蔬菜也运出去供应城市。他们这样说：“我们农民向来蔬菜吃的多，现在我们少吃一些，支援工人兄弟和城市居民，让大家高高兴兴，生产干劲更足。”
    叫淡季不淡的秘诀
    虹星一分社1958年蔬菜生产能够作到四季常青、淡季保证供应，主要是在生产技术上抓住了水、肥、土三大增产措施。他们在1957年的冬天就掀起了开河、积肥运动，又平整土地，改良了土壤一千五百亩以上，从前豆麦歉收的土地，现在已变成样样蔬菜能种的良田了。
    在8、9月份里，又抓住了抗干旱、抗高温，1、2月份抓住了防寒流、防霜冻这两大关键，因而使他们在蔬菜生产上取得了显著的成绩。
    虹星一分社还采取了种水坑田和插种的办法，保证蔬菜淡季供应。种水坑田是从广州学来的，1958年一下就开辟了六十五亩，因而增加了六万五千斤蔬菜的淡季供应。
    “消灭高架白地”，这是一个新的口号。1958年在豇豆棚和黄瓜棚下面，都插种了菠菜、芹菜、荠菜等作物。长期作物插短期作物，高的里面插矮的，尽量利用前后空隙，抢种短期作物，也给淡季增加了产量。这个社还采取提前拉后，选留抗热耐寒品种，增加新品种等措施，使淡季旺季供应趋向了平衡。平卷心菜和秋卷心菜一般能供应九个月，现在把这两季卷心菜分别分为早慢两起。早的更提早，慢的更推迟，这样一穿插，就补满了三个月，使卷心菜月月能上市。这样，全社月月供应的有卷心菜、蕃茄、洋山芋、韭菜、青菜等；季季供应的有芹菜、荠菜、菠菜、萝卜和蘑菇等。
    跃进再跃进，1959年社员们表示要进一步贯彻和钻研增产技术措施，全面安排生产，增产更多的蔬菜，更好地完成均衡供应任务。
