(Our correspondent from Hefei, 20th) The mass tool reform movement in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, started with the reform of water control tools in the winter of 1957. It has been continuously advancing for more than a year and has now developed into a comprehensive reform of various agricultural tools, agricultural and sideline product processing tools, cooking utensils, transportation, handicrafts, commercial tools, and more.

In the past year or so, Fuyang Prefecture has created, reformed, and imitated more than 3,700 kinds of advanced tools, promoted the use of more than 11 million pieces, produced 6.26 million sets of ball bearings, installed more than 1.43 million rotating tools, and laid more than 600 kilometers of wooden tracks. Old-fashioned tools have also been completely reformed, realizing the improvement of old-fashioned tools and the bearingization of rotating tools. The efficiency of advanced tools after the reform has generally increased by more than two times, and some have increased by ten or even dozens of times. The creation and use of these advanced tools have greatly saved labor. According to rough estimates, the entire region saved more than 500 million workdays last year, accounting for more than half of the 900 million workdays required for various productions in the entire prefecture last year, playing a huge role in ensuring the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity realization of various indicators and measures of the Great Leap Forward in production.

Last year's tool reform has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses for tool reform. In order to welcome the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, people's communes in various places are summarizing last year's experiences and continuing to mobilize the masses to reform tools. At present, in terms of water control tools, in addition to promoting last year's advanced tools, various places have created various new tools, such as turntable carts, pulleys, bearing carts, etc., and more than 770,000 pieces have been reformed, basically eliminating the phenomenon of manual carrying. Using these advanced water control tools on this year's river network construction sites, the highest daily efficiency per person can reach more than 100 cubic meters. The reform of cooking utensils has also set off a wave. Various places have created and reformed a large number of steamed bun machines, vegetable cutting machines, noodle rolling machines, dumpling wrapping machines, converted to one stove with multiple pots, and local tap water equipment, etc. In terms of transportation, people's communes are building shipyards based on the construction of river networks. The entire prefecture has now produced various wooden ships with a carrying capacity of 7,500 tons. Handicraft tools such as saws, drills, planes, chisels, and stone and bamboo tools are also developing towards semi-mechanization or partial mechanization of certain processes.

According to the plan of Fuyang Prefecture, more than 5 million tools will be created and improved this year, mainly including more than 130,000 wheat harvesters, 60,000 rice transplanters, more than 130,000 topdressing carts, more than 238,000 water lifting tools, more than 130,000 rope traction machines, more than 65,000 wooden boats, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools, etc. These tools, plus the tools that have been reformed last year, will enable the labor efficiency of 3.8 million male and female laborers in the entire prefecture to double and greatly reduce labor intensity.

The main experiences of Fuyang Prefecture in carrying out the mass tool reform movement are: First, the party committees at all levels must have determination. The tool reform work in this prefecture is led by the first secretaries of the party committees at all levels, who regard tool reform as the primary measure in grasping production; and they have all established technical revolution committees, transferred strong cadres to specifically grasp, pay great attention to, and continuously grasp it. Therefore, a magnificent and massive reform movement of tens of millions of tools was quickly launched, reaching more than 80,000 pieces of advanced tools made daily in August and September last year.

Second, resolutely and comprehensively mobilize the masses. There is a struggle between two lines in the process of tool reform in Fuyang area: one is to rely only on a few iron and wood technicians to do it, and the other is that the party committee takes the lead and mobilizes the whole party and all the people to engage in mass movements. The leaders in Fuyang area used facts to refute the former wrong line and adopted the method of resolutely and comprehensively mobilizing the masses. All localities vigorously encouraged the masses to create and mobilized everyone to offer suggestions and ideas, and generally held Zhuge Liang meetings to give full play to the talents of the five craftsmen of iron, wood, copper, silver, and stone. More than 50,000 people in the entire prefecture have made inventions and creations to varying degrees in tool reform, and more than 8,000 local experts have emerged. In solving the tool manufacturing force, Fuyang area also let go of the masses, put forward the slogan of "everyone is an iron and wood craftsman, every household is a factory," and handed over the technology of manufacturing tools and the task of manufacturing tools to the masses. In this way, the entire prefecture completed the manufacture of advanced tools in a timely manner. In solving the raw materials for tool reform, the method of relying on the masses to raise funds to solve the problem was also implemented. Last year, the entire prefecture manufactured more than 10 million advanced tools without the state taking out a single penny, fully demonstrating the power of the masses.

In the movement to mobilize the masses to engage in tool reform, party committees at all levels also grasped political and ideological work. Because tool reform is not only a technical innovation, but also an ideological innovation. Although tool reform is an urgent requirement of the broad masses, some people have a skeptical wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, all localities calculated detailed accounts for the masses based on the labor needs of production to educate and improve the masses' understanding of tool reform. The entire prefecture also held 1,593 on-site meetings on tool reform, summarizing the experience of tool reform, which also played a great role in promoting the in-depth development of the tool reform movement.

Third, tool reform has a center in each period and preparations are made in advance. The tool reform in various places is planned and carried out in advance according to the needs of production in each period. For example, in winter and spring, water control tools are grasped; before the summer harvest, tools for harvesting, threshing, and rice transplanting are grasped; before the summer planting, water lifting, transportation, and agricultural and sideline product processing tools are grasped; before autumn, deep plowing plows, close planting drills, harvesting, and threshing tools are grasped; after autumn, potato processing, water control, and soil transportation tools, as well as other tool reforms such as cooking utensils, are grasped. What is needed is changed as early as possible and inserted into all aspects of production, which can well meet the production needs of each period and is easily accepted by the masses. After the masses reform a batch of tools, they can immediately use them in production and see their role, and their enthusiasm for tool reform will be even higher. In this way, concentrating forces and carrying out one battle after another can gradually develop from the reform of some tools to the comprehensive tool reform.

    抓紧工具改革　解决劳力不足　保证更大跃进
    大大地提高农业劳动生产率
    阜阳专区总结去年丰富经验，进一步全面改革工具
    本报合肥20日电　安徽省阜阳专区的群众性工具改革运动，从1957年冬治水工具的改革开始，一年多来持续前进，已发展到现在对各种农具、农副产品加工用具、炊事用具、交通运输、手工业、商业等工具的全面改革。
    一年多以来，阜阳专区共创造和改制、仿制各种先进工具三千七百多种，推广使用一千一百多万件，生产滚珠轴承六百二十六万套，安装各种运转工具一百四十三万多件，铺筑木轨道六百多公里。并将旧式工具全部改完，实现了旧式工具改良化，运转工具轴承化。经过改革的先进工具，工效一般都提高二倍以上，有的提高十倍或几十倍。这些先进工具的创造和使用，大大地节省了劳力，据粗略计算：全区在去年一年节省劳力达五亿多个工作日，占全专区去年全年各项生产所需九亿工作日的一半以上，对保证按时、按质、按量实现生产大跃进的各项指标和措施发挥了巨大作用。
    通过去年一年的工具改革，已经大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众对工具改革的积极性。为了迎接今年工农业生产更大跃进，各地人民公社正在总结去年的经验，继续发动群众改革工具。目前在治水工具方面，除推广去年的先进工具外，各地又创造出各种各样新的工具，如转盘斗车、滑车、轴承小车等，现已改制七十七万多件，基本消灭了挑抬现象。利用这些先进治水工具在今年河网化工地上，每人每天工效最高可达一百多公方。对炊事工具的改革也已掀起了热潮，各地创造和改制了大批做馍机、切菜机、轧面条机、包饺子机、改为一灶多锅、土自来水设备等等。在交通运输方面，各人民公社根据河网化的兴修情况，正在兴建造船厂，全专区现已生产载重量达七千五百吨的各种木船。手工业工具如锯、钻、刨、凿及石竹等工具，也正在向半机械化或部分工序机械化发展。
    按照阜阳专区的计划，今年将要创造和改良工具五百多万件，其中主要包括小麦收割机十三万多部，稻子插秧机六万部，追肥小车十三万多部、提水工具二十三万八千多件，绳索牵引机十三万多部，木船六万五千多只和农副产品加工工具等。这些工具，加上去年已改的工具，将能使全专区三百八十万个男女劳动力的劳动效率提高一倍，并可大大减轻劳动强度。
    阜阳专区开展群众性的工具改革运动的主要经验是：第一，各级党委要有决心。这个专区的工具改革工作，都是各级党委第一书记挂帅，把工具改革列为抓生产措施中的首要一条；并都建立了技术革命委员会，抽调强有力的干部具体掌握，大抓特抓，持续地抓，因此，迅速掀起了规模壮阔、声势浩大的千万件工具的改革运动，在去年8、9月份曾经达到日制先进工具八万多件。
    第二，坚决地全面发动群众。阜阳地区在改革工具过程中有两条路线的斗争：一条是只依靠少数铁木技术工人来搞，另一条是党委挂帅，发动全党、全民大搞群众运动。阜阳地区领导上用事实批驳了前一种错误路线，采取了坚决的全面发动群众的办法。各地都大力鼓励群众创造，发动大家献计献策，并普遍召开了诸葛亮会，充分发挥了铁、木、铜、银、石五匠的才能。全专区有五万多人在工具改革上都有不同程度的发明创造，出现了八千多个土专家。在解决工具制造力量方面，阜阳地区也放手发动群众，提出“人人当铁木匠，家家户户是工厂”的号召，把制造工具的技术和制造工具任务交给群众。这样，全专区及时完成了先进工具的制造。在解决工具改革原材料方面，也实行了依靠群众自筹解决的办法，去年全专区共制造一千多万件先进工具，国家未拿出一文钱，充分表现了群众的力量。
    在发动群众大搞工具改革的运动中，各级党委还抓紧了政治思想工作。因为工具改革不仅是技术上的革新，同时也是思想上的革新。工具改革虽然是广大群众的迫切要求，但是一部分人却抱着怀疑观望态度。因此，各地都根据生产上需要劳力的情况，为群众算细账，来教育提高群众对工具改革的认识。全专区还召开各种工具改革的现场会议一千五百九十三次，总结工具改革经验，这对改革工具运动的深入开展，也起了很大的推动作用。
    第三，工具改革在各个时期都有中心，并提前进行准备。各地的工具改革都是根据各个时期生产的需要提前作出规划进行的。如冬春抓治水工具；夏收前抓收割、打场、稻田插秧等工具；夏种前抓提水、运输、农副产品加工工具；秋前抓深耕犁、密植耧子、收割、脱粒等工具；秋后抓薯类加工、治水、运土工具，以及炊事用具等其他工具改革。要用什么便及早改什么，插到生产各个环节中去，这就能很好满足各个时期的生产需要，容易为群众接受。群众在改革一批工具后，立即能用到生产上去，看到它的作用，对工具改革的积极性就更加提高。这样集中力量，一个战役接着一个战役地进行，就能够由部分工具的改革，逐步发展到全面的工具改革。
