　　Beautifying Furniture Without Paint
　　The Shanghai Guofeng Paper Mill has successfully trial-produced a type of veneer paper.

　　When this paper is applied to wood and processed, it becomes a smooth, brightly colored wooden board that can be used to make furniture or decorate rooms and build walls. It is durable and the color is bright and does not fade.

　　After this veneer paper was successfully trial-produced, it was processed and evaluated by the Beijing Timber Company, which proved that it was of excellent quality.

    美化家具不用漆
    上海国丰造纸厂试制成了一种贴面纸。
    把这种纸张贴在木料上，经过加工，即成为表面光洁、色泽鲜艳的木板，用来制造家具或装饰房间，建筑板壁，坚固耐用，色泽鲜明不退。
    这种贴面纸试成后，经北京市木材公司加工鉴定，证明质量优良。
