New Developments in Worker-Peasant Relations
Sha Ying

Our country is in a great era of unprecedented prosperity and development. Over the past year, under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, we have implemented "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture" and "the whole people running industry," developing cooperation and mutual assistance between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas. In particular, the establishment of people's communes in rural areas across the country, the large-scale development of industry by the communes, and the advancement of the communes towards industrialization and agricultural factories have brought China's worker-peasant relations into a new period.

The Development of the Rural People's Commune System
Points out the way to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants

As everyone knows, after we implemented agricultural collectivization, this solved the contradiction between socialist industrialization and the individual agricultural economy, guiding the broad masses of peasants towards a path of common prosperity, and fundamentally eliminating the antagonistic relationship between urban and rural areas. However, after the victory of the socialist revolution, the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas still exist. Now, in terms of the technical level of production, industry is higher than agriculture, and cities are higher than villages; in terms of transportation, science, education, and culture, cities are also more developed than villages; in terms of living standards and living conditions, there are also certain differences between urban and rural people. Especially in terms of ownership, rural people's communes are still basically under collective ownership, while cities are mainly under ownership by the whole people. Although both of these forms of ownership are socialist public ownership, ownership by the whole people is more advanced than collective ownership. Everyone knows that these differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas are the result of the old division of labor and class antagonism in human history, and cannot be eliminated in a short time. Our task is to gradually reduce these differences and create conditions for eliminating them in the future.

Marx and Engels proposed the ideal of "combining agriculture with industry and gradually eliminating the difference between town and country" in the "Communist Manifesto." Lenin also said in his article "The Great Beginning" that we must not only abolish any private ownership of the means of production, but also "abolish the distinction between town and country, as well as the distinction between manual and intellectual workers." But how can we narrow and even eliminate the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas? The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and our country's experience, have found concrete ways and forms. Recently, the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated that the development of the rural people's commune system has pointed out the path of gradual industrialization of the countryside for our people, the path of gradual transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in the countryside, and also pointed out the path of gradual transition from socialist "distribution according to work" to communist "distribution according to needs," as well as "the gradual reduction and even disappearance of the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor," and so on.

The People's Communes Gradually Industrialize
The differences between workers and peasants will gradually narrow

Our country's people's communes are large-scale grassroots organizations that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs into one, with the government and the commune integrated. It has gone beyond the scope of a purely economic organization and has become a unity of economy, politics, military affairs, and culture. In terms of economy alone, it includes not only agriculture, but also a comprehensive economy including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At the same time, people's communes must vigorously develop industry and move towards industrialization, gradually transferring an appropriate amount of labor from agriculture to industry. In agriculture, we must also move towards mechanization and electrification. This will not only accelerate the process of national industrialization, not only promote the realization of ownership by the whole people in the countryside, but also narrow the differences between industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas.

Now, the people's communes across the country are striding forward towards industrialization. Many communes have established fertilizer plants, farm tool plants, pesticide plants, sugar factories, textile factories, as well as heavy industries such as mining, iron smelting, and steelmaking. Some have even established comprehensive small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises ranging from iron smelting and steelmaking to forging, rolling, and metal products. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than six million industrial units run by counties and communes across the country. For example, by the beginning of October last year, Chengmen People's Commune in Minhou County, Fujian, had established 482 factories. In addition to transferring 800 laborers to participate in the construction of the county's iron and steel base, more than 300 laborers were also invested in the commune's iron-smelting production. Gangtie (Steel) People's Commune in Wuyang County, Henan, vigorously developed small-scale industry, and its current total industrial output value has greatly exceeded its total agricultural output value. Jiubujiang Commune in You County, Hunan, based on its original native blast furnaces, small blast furnaces, and low-temperature steelmaking furnaces, added small rolling equipment, mechanical processing equipment, and corresponding power equipment, and built a "small native joint" commune industrial base. According to the plan, it can produce 12,000 tons of iron, 64,000 tons of steel, 5,000 tons of steel products, 20,000 tons of coke, 15,000 tons of cement, and 200 tons of mechanical processing castings each year. In this way, on our vast land, due to the large-scale development of industry by the people's communes, blooming everywhere, like stars scattered across the sky, a completely new look has appeared on our country's industrial front.

The industries run by the people's communes in various places are mostly adapted to local conditions and use local materials due to different conditions in various places, and the forms are diverse, but they all have the following common characteristics: First, industry and agriculture support each other and are closely integrated; second, those engaged in production in the factories are both workers and peasants; third, these factories are mostly diversified and comprehensive joint enterprises; fourth, under the conditions of necessary division of labor, the producers are also managers, and the managers are also producers; fifth, as a production unit of the commune, this factory is not only an economic organization, but also an educational organization and an organization for promoting the collective welfare of the masses. Of course, the industries run by the people's communes are generally simple and crude, small in scale, with relatively rudimentary equipment, not very high productivity, and the quantity and quality of products are not enough; but we cannot look down on it, it has unlimited vitality, and in the process of its development, changes are bound to occur. It can gradually grow from small to large, from native to foreign, from low to high. This is a starting point for our people's communes to realize industrialization. At the same time, "small native groups" industry is one of the "two legs" of our current high-speed industrial development, which can accelerate the process of our country's national industrialization. Anyone who looks down on it will make a big mistake.

With the progress of industrialization of the people's communes, many major changes will be triggered in the countryside. For example: because the commune vigorously develops industry, it greatly stimulates the urgent demand for technical revolution and cultural revolution in the vast rural areas, and accelerates the process of agricultural mechanization and electrification. Because the commune vigorously develops industry, it requires unified allocation of labor and improvement of labor organization. The militarization of labor organization that we have begun to implement is to establish an industrial army that is both disciplined and democratic. Because the commune vigorously develops industry, and feels that there is a shortage of labor, due to the requirements of improving labor organization and liberating women, collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly have been established in rural areas. This collectivization of life further liberates the productive forces. Because the commune vigorously develops industry, it needs to fundamentally improve transportation conditions, so that trains, automobiles, and river transportation will all be greatly developed. Because the commune vigorously develops industry, the production of the countryside has developed. On the basis of production development, the lives of the rural people will be gradually improved, and the living conditions of the countryside will also be improved. All these changes that have been triggered and will be triggered, especially the combination of industry and agriculture, and the emergence of new people who are both workers and peasants, will promote the increasing reduction of the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas. This objective trend will become more and more obvious.

Only by accelerating the development of productive forces
Can we accelerate the elimination of the differences between workers and peasants

Under this trend, if someone thinks that we can now eliminate the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, that is an unrealistic idea, and that is a manifestation of being too impatient. Because our level of productive forces is still very low, and we are still a "poor and blank" country, there is no such possibility now. The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" pointed out that it will take fifteen, twenty, or even more years from now to build a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture; if we want to move from a socialist society to a communist society, it will take even longer. Only by constantly developing social productive forces, gradually enriching various products, and constantly raising the people's awareness, can we take appropriate steps to gradually transition socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people; only when the productive forces are further developed, the social products are extremely abundant, and other conditions for the transition to a communist society are ripe in the future, can we transition from a socialist society to a communist society. At that time, the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas will also disappear.

From this, we can know that in order to gradually narrow the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, and to create conditions for eliminating these differences in the future, the primary thing is to be enthusiastic about developing production and construction, rapidly improving social productive forces, and vigorously realizing socialist industrialization and the mechanization and electrification of agricultural production. In the people's communes, whether in industry, agriculture, or other production undertakings, there must be an all-round development, so that various products become increasingly abundant. With the rapid growth of social productive forces, new changes will inevitably occur in the field of production relations. In this way, in the process of developing productive forces, some new problems are raised for worker-peasant relations and urban-rural relations, such as the proportion of development between industry and agriculture, light industry and heavy industry, the relationship between accumulation and consumption, the distribution of workers and peasants, the living standards of urban and rural people, commodity production and price policies, etc.; for these problems, we must proceed from our country's population of more than 600 million, and make overall plans and reasonable arrangements based on actual conditions, in order to strengthen the close unity between workers and peasants, consolidate the mutual assistance and cooperation between urban and rural areas, and thus mobilize all positive factors to accelerate the process of socialist construction.

At present, the thing that is of great significance to worker-peasant relations and urban-rural relations is to consolidate and improve the people's communes. Only by consolidating this new social organization through education and rectification can the alliance of more than 500 million peasants and the working class be further consolidated and developed. The central link in consolidating and improving the people's communes is to develop production, so the rectification of the commune must be closely combined with the task of developing production. The policy of the people's communes for developing production, in addition to the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, must also implement the simultaneous development of self-sufficiency production and commodity production. Only by expanding commodity production and commodity exchange can the commune develop its economy, exchange for machines and equipment, and obtain consumer goods and cash to meet the needs of the commune to develop production and improve the lives of its members. At the same time, this can also supply a lot of industrial raw materials and living materials to the cities to meet the needs of the cities. Through this urban-rural commodity exchange, worker-peasant relations and urban and rural areas can achieve harmonious development. Our purpose in developing production is to improve the lives of the people, so we must gradually improve the lives of the people on the basis of developing production; only when the lives of the people are improved will the people's enthusiasm for production be greater. And while developing production and doing a good job in the people's lives, we should strengthen ideological education. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party requires us to comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and life. In this rectification of the commune, we must carry out an in-depth ideological education movement of socialism and communism to raise the awareness of the masses of the people. Of course, the working class must also conduct self-education in the spirit of communism, and unite with the people of the whole country to work together in production and construction with their exemplary actions. Only when production develops and people's awareness is raised, and conditions are increasingly created in both material and spiritual aspects, can we gradually narrow the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas.

    工农关系的新发展
    沙英
    我们的国家正处在一个前所未有的蓬勃发展的伟大时代。一年来，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀之下，我们实行“工农业同时并举”和“全民办工业”，发展工农之间、城乡之间的协作互助，特别是全国农村成立了人民公社，公社大办工业，公社向工业化、农业工厂化的方向前进，这就使我国的工农关系进入了一个新的时期。
    农村人民公社制度的发展
    指出消灭工农差别的道路
    大家都知道，当我们实行了农业合作化以后，这就解决了社会主义工业化同个体农业经济之间的矛盾，把广大农民群众导向一个大家共同富裕的道路，使城乡间的对立关系从根本上消除了。但是，在社会主义革命胜利之后，工农差别、城乡差别仍然是存在的。现在如果按生产的技术水平来说，工业是高于农业，城市高于乡村；如果就交通运输、科学、教育、文化等方面来说，城市也比乡村发达；如果就生活水平和居住条件来说，城乡人民也存在着一定的差别。特别是就所有制来说，现在农村人民公社基本上还是集体所有制，在城市中主要的是全民所有制，这两种所有制虽然都是社会主义的公有制，但是全民所有制则比集体所有制更进步。谁都知道，工农之间、城乡之间的这些差别，是人类历史上的旧式分工和阶级对立所造成的后果，是一时不能消灭的。我们的任务是逐步缩小这种差别，并创造条件，以便在将来消灭这种差别。
    马克思和恩格斯早在“共产党宣言”中就提出了“将农业同工业结合起来，促使城乡差别状况逐渐消灭”的理想。列宁也在“伟大的创举”一文中说过，我们不但要废除生产资料的任何私有制，而且“还要消灭城市和乡村的区别，以及体力劳动者和脑力劳动者间的区别”。但是，怎样缩小以至消灭工农之间、城乡之间的差别呢？党中央和毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义的理论和我国的经验，找到了具体的途径和形式。最近，在中共第八届中央委员会第六次全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中写道：农村人民公社制度的发展，为我国人民指出了农村逐步工业化的道路，指出了农村中的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的道路，同时也为我们指出了社会主义的“按劳分配”逐步过渡到共产主义的“按需分配”的道路，以及“城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别逐步缩小以至消失的道路”，等等。
      人民公社逐步工业化
      工农差别将逐步缩小
    我国的人民公社，是一种大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的基层单位。它已经超出了单纯的经济组织的范畴，而成为经济、政治、军事、文化的统一体。仅就经济方面来说，它不仅包括农业，而且是包括林业、牧业、副业、渔业等的综合经济。同时人民公社要大办工业，向公社工业化的方向发展，要逐步把适当数量的劳动力从农业方面转移到工业方面。在农业方面也要向机械化、电气化的方向发展。这样，不仅将加快国家工业化的进程，不仅将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，而且将会缩小工业和农业、城市和乡村的差别。
    现在，全国人民公社正昂首阔步向工业化前进。许多公社都建立了化肥厂、农具厂、农药厂、制糖厂、纺织厂，以及采矿、炼铁、炼钢等重工业，有的甚至建立了从炼铁、炼钢到锻制、轧钢及金属制品等综合性的小型钢铁联合企业。根据不完全统计，全国县和公社所办的各种工业单位已有六百多万个。例如：福建闽侯县城门人民公社到去年10月初，就已建立了四百八十二个工厂。它们除抽调八百个劳动力参加全县钢铁基地的建设以外，还有三百多个劳动力投入本社的炼铁生产。河南舞阳县钢铁人民公社大办小型工业，目前的工业总产值已大大超过农业总产值。湖南攸县酒埠江公社以原有的土高炉、矮高炉、低温炼钢炉为基础，增设小型轧钢设备、机械加工设备和相应的动力设备等，建成了一个“小土联”的公社工业基地。按照规划，每年可产生铁一万二千吨，钢六万四千吨，钢材五千吨，焦炭二万吨，水泥一万五千吨，机械加工铸造二百吨。这样，在我国广阔的土地上，由于人民公社大办工业，遍地开花，星罗棋布，使我国在工业战线上出现了一个焕然一新的面貌。
    各地人民公社所办的工业，由于各地的条件不同，大都是因地制宜，就地取材，形式多种多样，但是它们都具有以下的几个共同的特点：一、工业和农业是相互支援和密切结合的；二、在工厂中从事生产的既是工人又是农民；三、这种工厂大都是进行多种经营的、综合性的联合企业；四、在必要分工的条件下，生产者同时是管理者，管理者同时也是生产者；五、这种工厂作为公社的一个生产单位，它既是经济组织，又是教育组织和增进群众集体福利的组织。当然，目前人民公社所办的工业，一般来说，大都是因陋就简，规模比较小，设备比较土，生产率不大高，产品的数量和质量也不够多、不够好；但是我们不能看不起它，它有无限的生命力，在它发展的过程中是必然要起变化的，它可以逐步由小到大，由土到洋，由低到高。这是我们人民公社实现工业化的一个起点。同时“小土群”工业是我们当前的工业高速度发展的“两条腿”中的一条腿，它可以加速我国国家工业化的进程，谁要是看不起它，那就会犯大错误。
    随着人民公社工业化的进展，将在农村中引起许多重大的变化。譬如说：因为公社大办工业，就大大刺激了广大农村实行技术革命和文化革命的迫切要求，并且加速农业机械化、电气化的进程。因为公社大办工业，要求统一调配劳动力和改善劳动组织，我们已经开始实行的劳动组织的军事化，就是要建立一支既有纪律、又有民主的产业军。因为公社大办工业，而感到劳动力不足，由于改善劳动组织和解放妇女的要求，农村中办起了公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业，这种生活集体化，进一步解放了生产力。因为公社大办工业，需要根本改善交通运输条件，使火车、汽车、河运等都将大大发展起来。因为公社大办工业，农村的生产发展了，在生产发展的基础上，将会逐步改善农村人民的生活，也将会改善农村的居住条件。所有这些已经引起和将要引起的变化，特别是工农业互相结合，出现亦工亦农的新人，都会促进工农差别、城乡差别的日益缩小。这种客观的趋势将愈来愈明显。
    只有加快生产力的发展
    才能加快工农差别的消灭
    在这种趋势之下，如果有人以为现在我们就可以消灭工农之间、城乡之间的差别了，那是一种不切实际的想法，那是太性急了的表现。因为我们的生产力的水平还是很低的，还是一个“一穷二白”的国家，现在还没有这种可能。在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：要建成一个具有高度发展的现代化工业、现代化农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，从现在起需要十五年、二十年或者更多一些的时间；如果要从社会主义社会进入共产主义社会，那还需要更长一点的时间。我们只有不断发展社会生产力，使各种产品逐渐丰富起来，并不断提高人民的觉悟，才能采取适当的步骤，逐步地使社会主义的集体所有制过渡到社会主义的全民所有制；只有到将来生产力更加发展，社会产品极大的丰富了，向共产主义社会过渡的其他条件成熟了，我们才能从社会主义过渡到共产主义社会。那时，工农差别、城乡差别也就消失了。
    由此可知，为了逐步缩小工农差别和城乡差别，并创造条件以便将来消灭这种差别，首要的事情，是热心于发展生产和建设，高速度地提高社会生产力，用大力来实现社会主义工业化和农业生产的机械化、电气化。在人民公社中，不论工业方面、农业方面和其他生产事业方面，都要有一个全线的大发展，使各种产品日益丰富起来。随着社会生产力的高速度的增长，在生产关系的领域中也必将发生新的变化。这样，在发展生产力的过程中，就给工农关系和城乡关系提出了一些新的问题，例如工农业、轻重工业的发展比例问题，积累和消费的关系问题，工人农民的分配问题，城乡人民生活水平问题，商品生产和价格政策问题，等等；对于这些问题，都要从我国六亿多人口出发，根据实际情况，加以统筹兼顾，合理安排，才能加强工农间的亲密团结，巩固城乡间的互助协作，从而调动一切积极因素，以加速社会主义建设的进程。
    在目前来说，对工农关系和城乡关系具有重大意义的事情，就是要巩固和提高人民公社。只有使这种新的社会组织经过教育和整顿而巩固了，五亿多农民和工人阶级的联盟，才能更加巩固和发展。巩固和提高人民公社的中心环节是发展生产，因此整社又要同发展生产的任务紧密结合起来。人民公社发展生产的方针，除了工农业同时并举以外，还要实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。公社只有扩大商品生产和商品交换，才能发展经济，换回机器和设备，得到消费物资和现金，以满足公社发展生产和社员改善生活的需要。同时这样也可以有很多的工业原料和生活资料供应城市，以满足城市的需要。通过这种城乡的商品交换，工农关系和城乡便能得到和谐的发展。我们发展生产的目的是为了改善人民的生活，因此我们在发展生产的基础上，要逐步改善人民的生活；人民的生活有了改善，人民生产的劲头才会更大。并且在发展生产和搞好人民生活的同时，应当加强思想教育工作。党的八届六中全会要求我们，要全面地抓思想，抓生产，抓生活。在这次进行整社工作中，我们要开展一个深入的社会主义和共产主义的思想教育运动，来提高人民群众的觉悟。当然，工人阶级也要以共产主义精神进行自我教育，并在生产和建设中以自己的模范行动去团结全国人民共同奋斗。只有生产发展了，人民觉悟提高了，在物质方面和精神方面日益创造条件，才能逐步缩小工农之间、城乡之间的差别。
