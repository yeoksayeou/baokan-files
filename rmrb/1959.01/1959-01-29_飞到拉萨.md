Flying to Lhasa
By our reporter Ge Lai

One sunny afternoon after a snowfall, I took a plane from the mainland to Lhasa, a frontier city in the southwest of our motherland.

After the plane crossed the Qinling Mountains and Riyue Mountain, we saw Qinghai Lake, the largest inland saltwater lake in our country. The lake surface sparkled with azure blue waves, and a motorcade running on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway looked like a giant worm crawling on the flat road. Before long, the vast Qaidam Basin appeared under the wings, and we could see the red flag markers and drilling rigs erected by the basin developers.

The plane skimmed over the Kunlun Mountains, which resembled ocean waves, and then flew towards the Tibetan Plateau. At this time, the plane was flying very high, the temperature dropped, the people on board put on oxygen masks, and the cabin was heated, but a thick layer of ice flowers still formed on the glass windows. The pilot focused his attention on the snow line ahead, gripped the control stick tightly, and increased the throttle to the maximum, braving the fierce wind and clouds in the high altitude, and rushed towards the "air forbidden zone" on the "roof of the world". At this time, towering snow peaks appeared again below the wings. The driver skillfully threw the rising snow peaks behind one after another. Co-pilot Yang Jiazeng told me that the terrain of the Tibetan Plateau is very complex and the climate changes drastically. In the past, there were no accurate flight maps and a lack of obvious flight signs, so it had always been designated as an "air forbidden zone" before liberation. He proudly said: In order to support the Tibetan people and build a new Tibet, under the guidance of the Party, we finally overcame numerous difficulties and broke through the "air forbidden zone" in 1956, shortening the distance from Beijing to Lhasa.

The plane continued to cross the Tongtian River, the source of the Yangtze River, and the snow-capped Tanggula Mountains could be seen from afar. The Qiangtang pastoral area in northern Tibet was clearly visible. The undulating grasslands stretched into the distance, with many glittering lakes, black tents where herdsmen lived, and herds of cattle and sheep.

Soon, the plane entered a steep narrow valley. The Nyainqêntanglha snow peak was six hundred meters higher than the plane. The turbulence caused the plane to bump up and down a few times. At this time, the pilot was like driving a car on the road, advancing around the rugged valley, and landed smoothly at the airport near Lhasa.

We got into a car and arrived in the warm Lhasa River Valley agricultural area. In the fields, some Tibetan farmers were delivering fertilizer and leveling the land. Many rubber-wheeled carts appeared on the wide road. In the past, Tibetans relied on slow yaks and small donkeys to transport things. Now, Tibetans have learned to drive rubber-wheeled carts, and some use these carts to transport highland barley and wool.

The time I left Lhasa was not long, but the face of the city has undergone many new changes. The new buildings in the suburbs are almost more than double the size of old Lhasa. In the past, the areas around Lhasa and the suburbs more than ten miles away were all grasslands and wasteland. Now, water towers and factories have appeared in these places. The Bajiao Street in Lhasa is very lively. Tea, silk fabrics from Suzhou and Hangzhou, and various general merchandise brought from the mainland, which Tibetans love, are displayed in many new shops. The newly established Lhasa People's Broadcasting Station constantly broadcasts the good news of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, and more than a dozen huge anti-imperialist and patriotic slogans and cartoons have been erected on the streets.

When I first arrived in Lhasa, I took a tour of the city. I saw the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, Han workers, and Han cadres who were enthusiastically helping the Tibetan people build a new Tibet. A steelmaking furnace had just been built west of the Potala Palace, and the furnace was covered with congratulatory messages. Furnace worker Yao Shiyuan, who was testing a large blower, said that the day before yesterday they had picked up some ore from the mountains in the suburbs of Lhasa and smelted more than 500 kilograms of good quality iron. Walking into an auto repair shop in the suburbs, the roaring of machines came from many newly built workshops. In the forging workshop, young Tibetan forger Renqing was forging iron next to the scorching furnace. Han worker Hu Linhua and several other workers were testing a large gantry planer. When factory director Yang Zijiang introduced the situation of the factory, he said that last year they broke superstition and increased the number of automobiles repaired and assembled each month from 40 to more than 80, and at the same time successfully trial-produced electric motors and three-wheeled automobiles. The People's Liberation Army and office workers in Lhasa have cultivated a lot of land, and they have accumulated more than 50 million catties of fertilizer recently. Tibetan and Han students from the Tibet Local Cadre School and Lhasa Middle School voluntarily reclaimed dozens of acres of wasteland and planted tens of thousands of trees in their spare time.

The Tibetan cadres of the various departments of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region are growing rapidly under the vigorous cultivation and education of the Party and the specific help of Han cadres, and with the constant care of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. Many people have begun to become familiar with their work.

When I drove to the Lhasa River, a series of blasting sounds rang out in Gaba Mountain. Bulldozers shoveled up hard soil. A labor force composed of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, Han cadres from the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Tibetan laborers in Lhasa was launching a heated labor competition. They will split the two stone mountains in the Lhasa River Valley, build a dam and reservoir, and prepare to build a new hydroelectric power station here.

    飞到拉萨
    本报记者　格来
    一个雪后天晴的下午，我从内地乘坐飞机，到了祖国西南的边疆城市——拉萨。
    飞机越过秦岭、日月山以后，便看到我国最大的内陆咸水湖——青海湖，湖面上闪烁着蔚蓝色的波光，奔驰在青藏公路上的汽车队，像一条大爬虫在平坦的公路上蠕动。不一会，机翼下出现了广阔的柴达木盆地，可以看到盆地开发者插起的红旗标志和竖立起的钻探机。
    飞机掠过了海浪般的昆仑山，便向西藏高原飞去。这时，飞机已经飞得很高，气温下降，机上的人戴上了氧气面罩，机舱内散发着暖气，但玻璃窗上仍然结了一层很厚的冰花。飞行员精力专注地注视着前方的雪线，紧握着操纵杆，加大三个油门，冒着高空中凛冽的风云，向着“世界屋脊”的“空中禁区”冲去。此时机翼下面又出现了巍峨的雪峰，驾驶员巧妙地把崛起的雪峰一个接一个地抛在后边，副机长杨嘉增告诉我，西藏高原地形非常复杂，气候变化剧烈，过去没有准确的飞行地图和缺少明显的飞行标志，解放前一直被划为“空中禁区”。他自豪地说：为了支援藏族人民和建设新的西藏，我们在党的教导下，终于战胜了重重困难，在1956年突破了“空中禁区”，缩短了北京到拉萨的距离。
    飞机继续越过长江源头的通天河，远远就能望见白雪皑皑的唐古拉山脉。西藏北部的羌塘牧区历历在望了，起伏的草原伸展到远方，这里有许多亮晶晶的湖泊，一座座牧民居住的黑色帐篷和牛羊群。
    不久，飞机钻进一个险峻的狭谷，念青唐古拉雪峰比飞机还要高六百公尺，气流使飞机上下颠簸了几下，这时飞行员就像在公路上驾驶汽车一样，绕着崎岖的山谷前进，平稳地降落在拉萨附近的机场上。
    我们乘上汽车，到了温暖的拉萨河谷农业区。田野上有一些藏族农民们在送肥平地。宽阔的公路上出现了许多胶轮马车，过去藏民们依靠着缓慢的牦牛和小毛驴来驮运东西，现在藏民们学会赶胶轮马车了，有的用这种马车运青稞和羊毛。
    我离开拉萨的时间不算长，但这个城市的面貌却有了许多新的变化。市郊新的建筑物几乎相等于老拉萨的一倍多。过去拉萨市四周和十余里路以外的郊区，都是一片草地和荒滩，现在这些地方出现了水塔、工厂。拉萨市的八角街上很热闹，藏民们喜爱的从内地运来的茶叶、苏杭绸缎和各种百货日用品陈列在许多新的店铺里。新成立的拉萨市人民广播电台，不断播送着祖国内地大跃进的喜讯，大街上竖立起了十几幅巨大的反帝爱国的标语和漫画。
    我刚到拉萨的时候，在市区作了一次巡礼。看到进藏的中国人民解放军、汉族工人和汉族工作人员，正在热情地帮助藏族人民建设新西藏的情景。布达拉宫西边刚刚建立起了一座炼铁炉，炉旁贴满了贺喜报。正在试制大型鼓风机的炉工姚士元说，前天他们从拉萨市郊区的山上捡来了一些矿石，炼出了五百多公斤质量很好的铁。走进郊区的一个汽车修配厂，从新建的许多车间传出轰轰的机器声，锻工车间里，年轻的藏族锻工仁青在灼热的炉旁锻铁。汉族工人胡林华和其他几个工人正在试制一架大型的龙门刨床。厂长杨子江介绍这个厂的情况时说，去年他们大破迷信，从每个月修配四十台汽车提高到八十多台，同时还试制成功了电动机、三轮汽车。在拉萨的人民解放军和机关工作人员已经开垦了很多的土地，他们在最近积的肥料已有五千多万斤。西藏地方干部学校和拉萨中学的藏、汉族学员们，利用课余时间，自愿地开垦了数十亩荒地，种植了上万颗树木。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会各部门的藏族干部，几年来在党的大力培养教育和汉族干部的具体帮助下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的不断关心下，正在迅速成长。已有不少人开始熟悉自己的业务了。
    当我驱车来到拉萨河畔时，在嘎巴山响起了一阵劈山爆破的声音，推土机铲起了坚硬的土块，人民解放军驻拉萨部队和中共西藏工委的汉族干部以及拉萨市的藏族民工们组成的劳动大军，正在展开着热烈的劳动竞赛，他们将劈开拉萨河谷的两座石山，筑起拦河坝和水库，准备在这里新建一座水力发电站。
