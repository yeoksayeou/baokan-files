Consult workers more on what to teach and how to teach
Jiufeng Textile Mill's amateur school teachers reform teaching from a practical standpoint

    (Our dispatch) Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province—Teachers at the Jiufeng Textile Mill's workers' amateur school go deep into the workshops, eat, live, and work alongside the workers, learning production knowledge and operating skills in the process of production, so that teaching is closely integrated with production practice and the needs of the workers.
    The Jiufeng Textile Mill is an old factory, small in scale and equipped with simple equipment. The production output of its products is low, the quality is poor, and the costs are high. Since the establishment of the workers' amateur school in 1953, it has insisted on teaching for several years, improving the workers' cultural level. During the Great Leap Forward in production, the factory launched a technical innovation campaign, and all the workers were highly motivated, putting forward technical innovation proposals one after another, which led to a straight increase in the daily output of cotton yarn. However, the number of workers participating in amateur learning became less and less. The workers said: "The teachers talk eloquently in the classroom, but they cannot solve practical problems." Some said: "Formulas and laws, A B CD, class is like floating in the clouds, it is really impossible to understand." Therefore, the workers' amateur school had to suspend classes temporarily.
    Based on this situation, the factory's Party committee first organized the teachers to study the instructions on educational work and examined the problems with the past policy of workers' amateur education. At first, some teachers still emphasized that amateur education must be "regularized," believing that if teaching was combined with production practice and the needs of the workers, it would disrupt the systematic nature of the subjects and affect the quality of teaching. The factory's Party committee led all the teachers to debate this view and established the correct point of view: amateur education must be combined with production practice, meet the actual needs of the workers, help solve the problems raised in production, and promote the development of production. Through this review, many teachers realized that their thinking had not been well transformed, and that due to a lack of practical production knowledge, there were serious problems of being divorced from the masses and divorced from production in the past teaching. From this, it was proposed that teachers must go deep into the workshops and deep into the masses.
    After resuming classes, a series of reforms were made in teaching methods and teaching content, adopting a single-subject breakthrough teaching method, and dividing workers into classes according to their types of work. Yarn and cloth workers first learned Chinese. The Chinese teacher participated in the labor of the yarn reeling and drawing processes, and compiled the problems learned in production into texts, which were an important part of the entire teaching content; maintenance workers first learned mathematics, and the mathematics teacher participated in the maintenance of the spinning frame and compiled teaching materials related to practical mathematics for maintenance. Teachers also solicited workers' opinions on teaching in labor, meetings, and casual talks. The workers enthusiastically helped the teachers to become familiar with production, master operating skills, and studied teaching problems with the teachers.
    After participating in production, the teachers compiled some teaching materials that were rich in content, short in length, and easy for workers to accept. There were many new workers in the factory, and safety production education should be particularly strengthened. The Chinese teacher wrote a work injury accident that had occurred in the factory into a text and conducted teaching in conjunction with safety production measures, which had a good effect. After the mathematics teacher participated in production, he understood that the yarn guide angle on the spinning frame was composed of three parts: the leaf plate, the front roller, and the shrimp screw, and he knew that calculating the angle of the leaf plate and the sliver required using trigonometric functions. After explaining the sine function of trigonometric functions, he then guided the workers to calculate the drilling method of the screw circle. In the past, workers had difficulties in calculating pulleys and single and compound gears. The teacher combined this with the teaching of proportional identity transformations, and now more than 90% of the workers can accurately calculate it in five minutes.
    This practical teaching is warmly welcomed by the workers. After the resumption of classes, the number of participants increased from 240 in the first half of the year to more than 700, accounting for more than 90% of the factory's employees. Moreover, the output and quality of yarn have greatly improved. (Ding Zhixing)

    教什么怎样教多请教工人
    久丰纱厂业余学校教师从实际出发改革教学
    本报讯　浙江省宁波市久丰纱厂的职工业余学校教师，深入车间，与工人同吃同住同劳动，在生产中学习生产知识和操作技术，使教学同生产实际和工人的需要密切结合起来。
    久丰纱厂是一家老厂，规模不大，设备简陋，生产的产品产量低，质量差，成本高。自从1953年办起职工业余学校以来，几年来坚持教学，提高了工人的文化水平。在生产大跃进中，厂里开展了技术革新运动，全厂职工干劲冲天，纷纷提出技术革新的倡议，促使棉纱日产量直线上升。可是，职工参加业余学习的人数却越来越少。工人们说：“教师在课堂上讲得头头是道，就是不能解决实际问题。”有的说：“公式定律，A B CD，上课像腾云驾雾，实在领会不了。”于是，职工业余学校只能暂时停课。
    厂党委根据这一情况，首先组织教师学习关于教育工作的指示，检查过去职工业余教育方针的问题。开始，有的教师还强调业余教育必须“正规化”，认为如果教学同生产实际和工人需要结合起来，就会打乱学科的系统性，影响教学质量。厂党委领导全体教师对这种认识进行辩论，树立了正确的观点：业余教育必须结合生产实际，满足工人的实际需要，有助于解决生产中提出的问题，推动生产的发展。通过这次检查，许多教师认识到自己的思想还没有很好的改造，由于缺乏实际生产知识，因而在过去的教学中严重地存在着脱离群众、脱离生产的毛病。由此提出教师必须深入车间，深入群众。
    复课以后，在教学方法和教学内容上都作了一系列的改革，采取了单科突进的教学法，把工人按工种编班上课。纱布工人先学语文，语文教师就参加摇纱和并条两道工序的劳动，把生产中了解到的问题编成课文，作为整个教学内容的重要部分；保全、保养工人先学数学，数学教师就参加细纱保全工作，把保全、保养方面的实用数学编成教材。教师还在劳动、会议和闲谈中，征求工人对教学的意见。工人们热情地帮助教师熟悉生产，掌握操作技术，并和教师一起研究教学上的问题。
    教师参加生产之后，编写了一些内容充实，篇幅短小，易于为工人接受的教材。厂里的新工人很多，应该特别加强安全生产教育，语文教师就把本厂曾经发生过的一件工伤事故写成课文，配合安全生产措施进行教学，效果很好。数学教师参加生产之后，懂得了细纱车上的导纱角是由叶子板、前罗拉、虾米螺丝等三个部分组成的，并且知道了计算叶子板和细纱条干的角度，要用到三角函数。讲了三角函数的正弦函数之后，接着就指导工人计算螺丝圆的钻孔法。过去工人在皮带盘、单复齿轮的计算上有困难，教师在教比例的恒等变换时就结合进行讲解，现已有90％的工人能够在五分钟内准确地计算出来。
    这种从实际出发的教学，受到工人的热烈欢迎。复课之后，参加学习的人数从上半年的二百四十人增加到七百多人，占全厂职工的90％以上。而且纱的产量和质量都有很大提高。　（丁之行）
