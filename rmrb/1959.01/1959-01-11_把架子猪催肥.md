Fattening Up Young Pigs
Han Yijun, Deputy Director of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

In order to accelerate the development of the commune's sideline production and to welcome the first Spring Festival after a year of hard work and a comprehensive leap forward in the national economy, we must adopt various measures to maximize meat production.

How to increase meat production? There is a very effective way right now, which is to start fattening pigs immediately. It is estimated that among our existing 210 million pigs, at least 40 million are young pigs weighing over 80 jin. If we strengthen the feeding management of these 40 million pigs and take various fattening measures, they can all be fattened up by the Spring Festival to meet the needs.

There are many favorable conditions for launching the fattening of pigs now. First of all, the agricultural production in 1958 achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and the production of grain and agricultural and sideline products has greatly increased, which makes it possible to take out more coarse grains and by-products than in previous years to feed pigs. Secondly, in the 1958 Great Leap Forward in Production, the broad masses liberated their minds and created many very effective fattening methods. Vigorously promoting various new fattening techniques in light of local conditions can also greatly accelerate the fattening speed. Third, according to general production conditions, this time is the best time for fattening. A young pig can gain dozens of jin of meat in a few dozen days if various measures are taken to fatten it.

In order to effectively carry out this work, the following measures should be taken immediately:

(1) Each province (autonomous region) can determine the plan for fattening pigs before the Spring Festival based on the Spring Festival meat supply plan, external transfer, and export tasks. The people's communes should arrange the fattening work for commodity pigs and self-consumption pigs according to the tasks assigned by the state and their own needs, and the plan should be immediately passed down to each production team and each pig farm so that the plan is implemented and becomes action.

(2) According to the fattening plan, relevant departments should immediately arrange the supply of feed. People's communes, in accordance with the state grain plan, can take out a portion of the coarse grains (including waste grains, and potato crops) under the commune's own control to feed pigs.

(3) The people's communes should select a group of experienced people from the feeders to establish professional fattening teams and assign special personnel to be responsible for regularly checking the progress of the fattening work.

(4) Vigorously promote various effective fattening techniques, such as thyroidectomy, injecting protein and soybean oil into the pig's thyroid gland, and feeding various fattening drugs.

Our Party has always cared about the lives of the masses. At present, we must earnestly grasp this work. (Attached picture)

    把架子猪催肥
    农业部畜牧兽医局副局长　韩一均
    为了加速发展公社的副业生产和迎接苦战了一年取得国民经济全面大跃进以后的第一个春节，我们必须采取各种措施，尽最大努力来增产肉食。
    怎样增产肉食呢？现在有一条非常有效的办法，这就是马上开始进行生猪的催肥。据估计，我们现有的二亿一千多万头生猪中，八十斤以上的架子猪至少有四千万头，如果对这四千万头猪加强饲养管理和采取各种催肥措施，到春节的时候，就可以全部催成肥猪，供应需要。
    现在提出进行生猪催肥，有许多有利条件。首先是1958年的农业生产取得了空前的丰收，粮食和农副产品大大地增加了，这就有可能拿出比往年更多的杂粮和副产品去喂猪。其次，在1958年的生产大跃进中，广大群众解放了思想，创造了许多效果很好的催肥方法，因地制宜地大力推广各种新的催肥技术，也可以大大地加快肥育速度。第三，根据一般生产情况，这个时候正是催肥的最好时期。一头架子猪，如果采取各种措施催肥，几十天内可以长几十斤肉。
    为了把这一工作切实开展起来，就要立即采取以下几项措施：
    （1）各省（区）可根据春节肉食供应计划和外调以及出口任务，确定春节前的催肥猪的计划。人民公社要根据国家分配的任务和自己的需要，安排商品猪和自食猪的催肥工作，并且要把计划立即下达到每个生产队和每个养猪场，使计划落实，成为行动。
    （2）根据催肥计划，有关部门要立即安排饲料供应。人民公社按照国家粮食计划，可以把属于公社自己支配的杂粮（包括下脚粮、薯类）拿出一部分喂猪。
      （3）人民公社要从饲养员中挑选一批有经验的人，建立专业催肥队和指定专人负责，定期检查催肥工作进展情况。
      （4）大力推广各种行之有效的催肥技术，例如割甲状腺，给猪甲状腺注射蛋白、黄豆油和喂各种催肥药物等。
    我们的党历来是关心群众生活的，目前，我们一定要把这一工作认真地抓起来。（附图片）
