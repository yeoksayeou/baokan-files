Xinhua News Agency, 9th. This reporter's commentary:

The economic body of American monopoly capital is terminally ill, and it often needs stimulants to survive. A major stimulant is ever-increasing military spending. In the years since World War II, almost every time the government submits an annual budget and Congress discusses the budget, figures of the American ruling class stir up a frenzy of drumming up military expansion and war preparations. In the words of the American newspapers, at such moments, "the war drums sound again."

	The People Don't Want War
	But the Tycoons Crave Military Expansion

In a few days, Eisenhower will submit the budget for the 1960 fiscal year to Congress. As usual, government officials, generals, and newspaper commentators will be busy for a while. Although this official business has to be done every year, it is becoming more and more difficult. The reasons are: the serious economic crisis has added difficulties to the United States in terms of financial expenditures, the people do not want war, and the peaceful foreign policy and strength of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have greatly bankrupted the U.S.'s brinkmanship policy. But the Wall Street bosses don't care about these things. When progressive people all over the world are cheering the achievements of Soviet scientific development in opening a new era of interstellar flight, when mankind's first cosmic rocket goes into space, the shocked and frustrated Washington figures actually use this as an excuse to chew on the tongue of stepping up war preparations. U.S. Democratic Congressman McCormack clamored to guard against "a Pearl Harbor incident in outer space." The Army issued an announcement saying that the United States must "accelerate the invention" of a rocket super-thruster and cargo rocket system, "if this ideal is realized, troops can eventually be transported anywhere in the world within a few hours." Truly, three sentences cannot stray from their profession! The agents of Wall Street are not really thinking of competing with the Soviet Union in scientific development; everything is for the sake of stepping up war preparations. At this moment, the contrast between the two systems of peace and war, the Soviet Union and the United States, seems even stronger than in the past.

American capitalists are good at playing tricks, but the "stimulus for military spending fever" several times a year is essentially the same. People remember that before the government budget was proposed at the beginning of last year, there were two reports from the "Gaither Committee" and the "Rockefeller Special Research Group" that fanatically advocated increasing military spending and conducting "limited wars." This year, a committee of Congress issued a report on January 3, specifically stating how "lacking" the United States' domestic preparations for nuclear war still are. A report from the "National Planning Association" at the end of last year said even more openly that the United States "does not need a peaceful budget in the current historical stage" and must spend "several billion dollars more" in the military field, "no matter how seriously this may disrupt the budget balance." NBC also started the "Our Predicament" TV program in the new year. Former Army Chief of Staff Ridgway and current Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Hayward, one after another, advocated stepping up the nuclear arms race on the program.

	The President is Preparing to Increase Military Spending
	But the Bosses Still Think the Amount is Small

Eisenhower had already stated in December last year that the "defense spending" in the next fiscal year's budget "will be more than ever before in peacetime." And some Democratic congressmen believe that Eisenhower's "increased figures are too conservative." They advocated that in the new fiscal year, direct military spending should be drastically increased from the current 40.8 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars. Of course, behind this kind of advocacy is the opinion of powerful American monopoly financial groups. American oil tycoon Nelson Rockefeller proposed to increase military spending by 3 billion U.S. dollars every year, and increase it year by year. This year, it will increase by 6 billion U.S. dollars.

	The Economic Crisis is Still Serious
	Want to Rely on Armaments to Stimulate

The American economy currently continues to need the "stimulation" of large-scale military spending. The United States is in a deep economic crisis. From the sharp decline in production that began the year before last to April last year, American capitalists were panicked. A "research report" from a Wall Street investment company, Goodbody & Co., once said that "the entire economic community is eagerly awaiting the new (military order) 'large-scale start date,'" "It is no exaggeration to say that the major influence on our country's current economy and the economy for the next few years will likely be our spending on defense." Sure enough, the "large-scale start date" came. In the second quarter of last year, government military contracts reached a new peak in peacetime. In the first half of last year, the annual rate of military procurement and construction contracts was 9 billion U.S. dollars higher than the year before last. Following this, Dulles successively created "war brinkmanship" in the Middle East and the Taiwan Strait. U.S. industrial production had a partial recovery after May last year due to some artificial stimuli, but this recovery will not last long. The famous American bourgeois economist Hobbs estimates that industrial production may drop sharply again in the second quarter of this year. American capitalists are naturally looking forward to a new "large-scale start date."

	Stepping Up Military Expansion is Dangerous
	Financial Bankruptcy is Difficult to Avoid

However, the United States' further massive increase in military spending also contains great dangers, because stepping up military expansion has already led to a serious financial and monetary crisis. The budget deficit for this fiscal year will be as high as more than 12.2 billion U.S. dollars, and the national debt will accumulate to a peak of 288 billion U.S. dollars. Eisenhower also pointed out in November last year that a further massive increase in military spending "will bankrupt the United States." At present, there are two factions among the American monopoly bourgeoisie. One faction opposes a major increase in military spending, while the other powerful faction advocates continuing to increase military spending regardless of rising deficits. The struggle between these two factions is fiercely unfolding. However, the dispute between these two factions is only about the amount of the increase, and in general, they agree on the continued need to maintain huge military spending. In any case, this means that the American people will pay more taxes and make more sacrifices. It seems that Washington's apologists for "guns rather than butter" are going to "preach" to the American people again. (Attached image)

### 要为病入膏肓的经济打强心针  华盛顿又响起鼓吹扩军的叫嚣

    要为病入膏肓的经济打强心针
    华盛顿又响起鼓吹扩军的叫嚣
    新华社9日讯　本报记者的述评：
    美国垄断资本的经济躯体已经病入膏肓，经常需要用强心针来苟延残喘。一种主要的强心针是，越来越庞大的军事开支。在第二次世界大战以来的年份里，几乎每当政府提出年度预算以及国会讨论预算的时候，美国统治阶级人物都要煽起一阵鼓吹扩军备战的歇斯底里。用美国报纸的话来说，在这种时刻，“战鼓又响起来了”。
    人民不愿意战争
    富豪却渴望扩军
    再过一些天，艾森豪威尔就要向国会提出1960财政年度的预算。照例，政府官员、将军和报刊评论员们又要忙碌一阵。尽管这件公事年年要办，但是却越办越不顺手。原因是：严重的经济危机使得美国在财政开支方面增添了困难，人民不愿意战争，苏联和其他社会主义国家的和平外交政策和力量强大，使得美国的战争边缘政策大大破产。但是华尔街老板不管这些，当全世界进步人类都在欢呼苏联科学发展的成就开辟了星际飞行新纪元，人类第一个宇宙火箭上天的时候，震惊沮丧的华盛顿人士竟借此嚼起加紧备战的舌头来。美国民主党议员麦考马克叫嚷，要提防“在外层空间中遭受一次珍珠港事件”。陆军发布公告说，美国必须“加速发明”一种火箭超级推进器和货运火箭系统，“如果这种理想实现的话，最后能够在几小时以内就把军队运往全球任何地方”。真是三句话不离本行！华尔街的代理人那里是想真正在科学发展上同苏联竞赛，一切都是为了加紧备战。此时此刻，苏联和美国这两种和平和战争制度之间的对照，显得比过去更为强烈。
    美国资本家是好翻弄花样的，然而每年几度的“刺激军费开支热”实质上是一模一样的。人们记得，在去年初政府预算提出的前夕，出现了狂热鼓吹增加军费以及进行“有限战争”的“盖瑟委员会”和“洛克菲勒特别研究组”的两份报告。今年是国会的一个委员会在1月3日发表报告，专门申述美国国内关于核战争的准备工作还如何“缺乏”。“全国计划协会”去年年底的报告更公开说，美国“在目前历史阶段不需要和平预算”，必须再在军事方面“多花几十亿美元”，而“不管这可能多么严重地破坏预算平衡”。美国广播公司也在新年开办“我们的处境”电视节目，前陆军参谋长李奇微、现任海军作战副参谋长海华德等一个接一个在节目里主张加紧核军备竞赛。
    总统准备增军费
    老板还嫌数目小
    艾森豪威尔去年12月便已发表声明说，下一财政年度预算里的“国防费用将比和平时期中的以往任何时候都要多”。而国会里一些民主党议员还认为艾森豪威尔“增加的数字过于保守”，他们主张在新财政年度里把直接军事开支从目前的四百零八亿激增至六百亿美元。当然，在这种主张的后面，是美国有势力垄断财团的意见。美国石油大王纳尔逊·洛克菲勒去年提出，要每年增加三十亿美元军费，而且逐年累进，今年便要增加六十亿美元。
    经济危机仍严重
    想靠军火来刺激
    美国经济目前继续需要大量军费的“刺激”。美国正处在深刻的经济危机中。从前年开始生产猛烈下降到去年4月，美国资本家人心惶惶。华尔街一家老投资公司——古德博迪公司的“研究报告”曾经说，“整个经济界都在急迫地等待着新的（军事定货）‘大规模开始日’”，“可以毫不夸张地说，对我国目前经济以及今后若干年经济起重大影响的，将很可能是我们在防御方面的开支”。果然，“大规模开始日”来了，去年第二季度政府军事合同达到和平时期的新高峰，去年上半年军事采购和建筑合同的年率比前年高出九十亿美元。跟着，杜勒斯又接连在中东和台湾海峡制造起“战争边缘”来。美国工业生产在去年5月后靠一些人为刺激因素有局部回升，但是这种回升是长久不了的。美国著名资产阶级经济学家霍布斯估计，今年第二季度工业生产可能再度急剧下降。美国资本家自然又在期待着新的“大规模开始日”了。
    加紧扩军危险大
    财政破产难避免
    不过，美国要再大量增加军费也包含着很大的危险，因为加紧扩军已经促致严重的财政金融危机。本财政年度的预算赤字将高达一百二十二亿美元以上，国债将累积至二千八百八十亿美元的高峰。艾森豪威尔在去年11月也指出，军费再大量增加“将使美国破产”。目前美国垄断资产阶级里分作两派，一派反对军费再大事增加，另外有势力的一派则主张不惜赤字上升，继续增加军费。这两派间的斗争正在激烈展开着。然而，这两派争执的也只是增加的数量，而在继续需要保持庞大军费上，一般是一致的。无论如何，这都意味着美国人民交的更多的赋税，作出更多的牺牲。看来，华盛顿“要大炮不要牛油”的辩护士又要来向美国人民“说教”了。（附图片）
