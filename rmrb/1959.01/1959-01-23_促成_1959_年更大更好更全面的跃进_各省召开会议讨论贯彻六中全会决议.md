To promote a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, provinces are holding meetings to discuss and implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session.

Zhejiang

(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd dispatch) The Third Session of the Second Zhejiang Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held from December 28th of last year to January 10th of this year.

The meeting, based on the requirements of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the unified national plan, and based on Zhejiang Province's resources, technological foundation, and other conditions, discussed and formulated the province's economic construction plan for 1959. The meeting determined that the province's task for this year is to focus on the three "marshals" of grain, steel, and machinery, and the three "vanguards" of coal, electricity, and transportation, to develop industrial and agricultural production at high speed; to carry out technical and cultural revolution movements; and to continuously improve the people's material and cultural lives on the basis of production development. According to the plan, the province's national economy will have a greater leap forward than in 1958, with significant increases in the output of steel, grain, cotton, and oilseeds compared to 1958. At the same time, it is required that under the unified guidance of the national plan, priority be given to developing raw material industries, mainly metallurgy, and the machinery industry, developing various light industries and people's commune industries, and developing forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, industrial raw material crops, and cash crop production.

In order to complete the above tasks, the meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to implement the entire set of "walking on two legs" policies, based on the priority development of heavy industry, and the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. According to the tasks for 1959 and the current situation, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels in the province should take the lead in directing the work of consolidating the communes, grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other.

After summarizing the tremendous superiority that the people's communes across the province have demonstrated from their birth to the present, the congress pointed out that the urgent task of Party organizations at all levels is to conscientiously implement the "Resolution on Certain Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and to focus on production to carry out a rectification and consolidation of the people's communes. During the consolidation, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationships between production and distribution, democracy and centralization, accumulation and consumption, and production and life, in accordance with the Party's policies, and to properly arrange the work in the five aspects of ideology, production, distribution, life, and improved management, and to do everything practically well, so as to set off a greater production upsurge than in 1958. The meeting believed that the key to doing a good job in consolidating the communes lies in earnestly publicizing and implementing the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. All localities should closely combine the current production and commune consolidation work, and launch a vigorous socialist and communist education movement, talking extensively about the great victory of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, talking extensively about the tasks for 1959 and the great political and economic significance of realizing these tasks, and talking extensively about advanced experiences and commending good people and deeds. It is necessary to deeply publicize the Party's policies and make them known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. And fully use the methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, to boldly mobilize the masses and rectify while correcting. This will further consolidate and develop the achievements and promote a greater leap forward in production.

The meeting pointed out that while rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, the grassroots units of industrial and mining enterprises and cultural and educational undertakings should also conduct a rectification and improvement work by summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. During the rectification, emphasis should be placed on summarizing and promoting various advanced experiences, improving labor organization, and improving labor productivity. So that all economic work is both focused and comprehensive, seeking both quantity and quality, and constantly overcoming blindness, so that economic work becomes more and more detailed, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The meeting also called on all localities to earnestly summarize and vigorously promote advanced experiences in reforming tools, improving operating methods, improving labor organization, improving labor productivity, high-yield agriculture, improving product quality and comprehensive utilization in industry around industrial and agricultural production and various tasks, and to carry out a vigorous mass movement to learn from advanced, catch up with advanced, and surpass advanced, and strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

Heilongjiang

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 22nd dispatch) The Third Session of the First Heilongjiang Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party lasted for twenty-two days and ended on the 16th. The meeting, based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, summarized the experience of the Great Leap Forward in Heilongjiang Province in 1958 and determined the province's work for the future.

The meeting, based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session and the current work situation in Heilongjiang Province, proposed that the task of Party organizations and the people of the province is to continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and the entire set of "walking on two legs" policies, to implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session and the Central Committee's instructions on the work of the Northeast region, and to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction according to the objective law that the national economy must develop in proportion, to complete the task of vigorously supporting the whole country, and to build a prosperous and happy Heilongjiang Province.

The meeting, according to the above spirit, stipulated the main tasks of economic construction in Heilongjiang Province for the future. In terms of industrial production and construction, it is necessary to first grasp the leadership of the machinery industry in accordance with the requirements of vigorously supporting the whole country, fully tap potential, strengthen coordination, and pass the test of "heavy (type), large (type), precise (sion), sharp (top-notch)," and at the same time grasp the production of steel, coal, and timber to ensure the completion of various tasks stipulated by the state. On the other hand, it is necessary to actively and correspondingly strengthen the weak departments of electricity, transportation, geology, light industry, and chemical industry.

In agriculture, it is necessary to continue to increase grain yield per unit area and total output, and conscientiously and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture; at the same time, it is necessary to vigorously develop industrial raw materials, oil crops, vegetables, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, fishery, and other diversified operations and commune-run industries, expand commodity production, and gradually realize the industrialization of communes and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and to establish a certain foundation in 1959. With the development of production, it is necessary to further improve the people's lives and ensure that the actual income of workers and farmers increases appropriately year by year.

The meeting seriously discussed the issue of implementing the "walking on two legs" policy in future economic construction, and believed that the development of various departments of the national economy in Heilongjiang Province in the past few years has been basically mutually adapted, but with the development of industry, especially heavy industry, the industrial output value in 1958 has reached 63.1% of the province's total industrial and agricultural output value; the urban population has reached 41.6% of the province's total population. Therefore, in agriculture, light industry, and diversified agricultural operations, it is necessary to take measures as soon as possible to strengthen these three aspects while ensuring key construction.

The meeting emphasized that consolidating and improving the people's communes is an extremely important political task. Party organizations at all levels must organize Party members and cadres to earnestly study and implement the "Resolution on Certain Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and through comprehensively grasping ideology, grasping production, grasping distribution, grasping life, grasping organization, and grasping work style, effectively do a good job in consolidating the communes in the next few months.

The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, implement the mass line, improve thinking, and improve work style, and believed that this is the fundamental guarantee for the victorious completion of all future tasks.

Shanxi

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 22nd dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a plenary meeting from January 2nd to 10th. Prior to this, a preparatory meeting was held for ten days. The meeting was chaired by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, who conveyed in detail the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's instructions, and conducted full study and discussion by adopting the method of focusing on the abstract through the concrete, discussing the abstract based on the concrete, and linking theory with practice. The meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in the province in 1958, determined some of the main indicators of the province's national economic development in 1959, made a resolution on rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, studied financial and trade, cultural and educational and other work, and comprehensively arranged the work for the first quarter of this year.

The meeting believed that the objective possibility exists for realizing the province's 1959 leap forward targets of doubling steel, iron, grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other targets. And these indicators are like fruits growing on trees, you can't pick them if you stand still, but you can pick them if you jump up. In order to turn objective possibilities into realities, the meeting highly emphasized grasping the work in the first quarter, and believed that it is necessary to correctly implement the entire set of two-legged walking policies for developing the national economy determined by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and to correctly handle six key issues: (1) Industry: Under the premise of the whole country as a chess game, taking steel as the key link, ensuring key points, and ensuring the completion of production tasks, implement the two-legged walking policy of simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, combining key points and general points, and combining production and basic construction. It is necessary to constantly adjust the proportional relationship between them. (2) Agriculture: Under the premise of taking grain as the key link and ensuring the completion of agricultural production, implement the policy of simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, simultaneously developing production and basic construction, simultaneously developing garden-style farmland and managing general farmland, simultaneously developing commune agriculture and industry, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, in order to continuously promote the all-round revolution of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and continuously promote the mechanization and electrification of agriculture from low to high and from indigenous to foreign. It is necessary to find out the laws of increasing production like the "Eight-Point Charter" in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, just like agricultural production. (3) Change the situation where the "vanguard" lags behind the "marshal," and launch a movement of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation and running the power industry according to the policy of combining large, medium, and small and combining indigenous and foreign, to meet the needs of a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture. (4) Appropriately allocating labor and striving to improve the utilization rate of labor and labor productivity is the key to whether industrial and agricultural production can achieve a double victory in 1959. It is necessary to criticize the viewpoint and method of mechanically and statically calculating dead accounts, vigorously carry out the technical revolution movement, combine tool reform with improving labor organization, and combine hard work with skillful work, so that the efficiency of one working day in 1959 is equal to the efficiency of one and a half or even two working days in 1958. (5) Production and life are two contradictory things that are closely linked and mutually promote each other. Production occupies a dominant position, but under certain conditions, life becomes the main problem. All cadres must understand that the more industrial and agricultural production leaps forward, the more we must care about the lives of the masses, and the more we care about the lives of the masses, the more industrial and agricultural production can leap forward. (6) In order to ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction in 1959, it is necessary to carry out the ideological struggle between the two lines of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and achieving fewer, slower, worse, and more wasteful results from beginning to end. Establish a comprehensive view of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Arm the thinking of cadres and the masses with the existing rich experience and scientific knowledge of fighting against nature, and prevent and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. It is necessary to combine mass movements with centralized leadership, and combine giving play to people's subjective initiative with objective laws, so as to correctly implement the Party's mass line and achieve the greatest results of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The meeting required Party committees at all levels to regard the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes as the central task of the Party in the countryside at present, and to be led by the first secretary, mobilize and organize a large number of cadres to invest in the movement, and strive to complete the task before the end of April this year. In the process of consolidating the communes, it is necessary to closely combine the consolidation of the communes with current production from beginning to end. This consolidation of the communes is a movement to study and implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a deeper and more comprehensive socialist and communist education movement, and a mass movement to handle a series of issues such as production, life, distribution, and business management of the people's communes under leadership. After this rectification and consolidation, the superiority of the people's communes will be brought into play more fully and comprehensively, thereby powerfully promoting a greater leap forward in the province's industry, agriculture, and other socialist construction undertakings.

Anhui

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 22nd dispatch) The four-level cadre meeting convened by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on December 26th of last year ended on January 16th. More than 2,600 responsible cadres of Party committees at all levels above the people's communes participated in this meeting.

The meeting, according to the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session, earnestly studied the work of comprehensively rectifying the people's communes. It was believed that the requirements for rectifying the communes are: rectifying thinking and work style; establishing and improving various organizational systems; combining the rectification of the communes with doing a good job in production and distribution, and improving the lives of the masses. The methods of rectifying the communes are: closely combining with production; conducting key trials, completing in batches, requiring the end of key trials by the end of January, and carrying out comprehensive rectification of the communes in two batches, ensuring the completion of the rectification task by the end of April.

The meeting believed that the rectification of the communes can be roughly divided into four steps: The first step is to study documents, arrange current production and life, do a good job in distribution and canteen work, and sum up experiences and lessons, and carry out criticism and self-criticism among cadres. The second step is to widely publicize the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session to the masses, so that everyone knows it. On this basis, summarize the achievements and shortcomings in production, and mobilize the masses to carry out airing of views, and rectify while correcting. The third step is to improve the organization, revise rules and regulations, formulate business management methods, and formulate annual production and life plans. The fourth step is to handle outstanding issues, convene a meeting of commune members, elect cadres, organize production, and carry out competitions. The meeting also pointed out that the rectification of the communes must strengthen the Party's leadership, and the first secretary of the Party committee should personally take the lead.

The meeting believed that the management of the people's communes should conscientiously establish a production responsibility system, and implement the principle of democratic centralism, that is, "collective living, combat-like action, militarized organization, and democratized management." The meeting criticized the erroneous understanding of separating production and life, as well as the erroneous understanding that grasping life is only regarded as daily administrative work, which does not require leaders to worry about. The meeting also discussed the organizational structure of the people's communes, and many systems such as production, finance, distribution, and life, and made regulations.

The meeting earnestly discussed this year's production work, and unanimously agreed that Anhui Province's industrial and agricultural production in 1958 achieved unprecedented development. Other tasks have also achieved great results. This year is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and we must strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward. In order to ensure the completion of this year's tasks, the meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and implement the four simultaneous development and "walking on two legs" policies proposed by the Central Committee. The meeting particularly emphasized that, according to past experience, especially the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the rational arrangement and use of labor, reducing labor intensity, and improving labor efficiency are the basic key to developing various production and construction undertakings. Therefore, it is necessary to do everything possible to improve labor efficiency. To this end, it is necessary to rationally arrange labor, do a good job in labor allocation; improve labor organization, formulate labor quotas, eliminate idling; achieve rational layout in various construction undertakings; and carry out a comprehensive technical innovation and tool reform movement in various labor in various departments and industries of industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and catering.

    促成1959年更大更好更全面的跃进
    各省召开会议讨论贯彻六中全会决议
    浙江
    本报杭州22日电　中共浙江省第二届代表大会第三次会议从去年12月28日到今年1月10日举行。
    会议根据八届六中全会决议的要求和国家统一计划，并根据浙江省的资源、技术基础等条件，讨论和制定了全省1959年的经济建设规划。会议确定今年全省的任务是以粮食、钢铁、机械三大“元帅”和煤炭、电力、交通运输三个“先行官”为重点，高速度地发展工农业生产；开展技术革命和文化革命运动；在生产发展的基础上不断地改善人民的物质生活和文化生活。根据规划，全省国民经济将比1958年有更大的跃进，其中钢、粮食、棉花、油料等的产量都将比1958年有不少增长。同时要求在国家计划统一指导下，重点发展以冶金为主体的原材料工业和机械工业，发展各种轻工业、人民公社工业，发展林、渔、牧、副业及工业原料作物和经济作物的生产。
    为了完成上述任务，会议认为必须继续实行在优先发展重工业的基础上，工业和农业并举等一整套用“两条腿走路”的方针。根据1959年的任务和目前的情况，全省各级党委第一书记应当挂帅领导整社工作，一手抓工业、一手抓农业。
    代表大会在总结了全省各地人民公社从诞生到现在已经显示出来的巨大优越性以后指出，目前各级党组织的迫切任务，就是要认真贯彻执行八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，围绕生产抓紧对人民公社进行一次整顿和巩固工作。在整社中必须按照党的政策正确处理生产和分配、民主和集中、积累和消费、生产和生活等方面的关系，把思想、生产、分配、生活、改进经营管理等五个方面的工作妥善安排好，一项一项都切实做好，掀起比1958年更大的生产高潮。会议认为，搞好整社工作的关键在于认真宣传和贯彻执行八届六中全会的决议。各地应当紧密结合当前生产和整社工作，开展一个轰轰烈烈的社会主义和共产主义教育运动，大讲1958年全面大跃进的伟大胜利，大讲1959年的任务和实现这些任务的重大政治意义和经济意义，大讲先进经验和表扬好人好事。要深入宣传党的方针政策，使之家喻户晓，深入人心。并充分运用大鸣大放大辩论大字报的方法，放手发动群众，边整边改。这样就会进一步巩固和发扬成绩，促进生产的更大跃进。
    会议指出，在整顿巩固人民公社的同时，对于工矿企业和文教事业的基层单位，也应当通过总结1958年大跃进的经验，进行一次整顿和提高工作。在整顿时应当着重总结和发扬各种先进经验，改进劳动组织，提高劳动生产率。使各项经济工作既有重点又有全面，既求数量又求质量，不断克服盲目性，使经济工作越做越细，多快好省。
    会议还要求各地围绕工农业生产和各项工作，认真总结和大力推广改革工具、改进操作方法、改善劳动组织、提高劳动生产率、农业高产、工业提高产品质量和综合利用等方面的先进经验，开展轰轰烈烈的学先进赶先进超先进的群众运动，争取1959年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    黑龙江
    本报哈尔滨22日电　中共黑龙江省第一届代表大会第三次会议开了二十二天，到16日结束。会议根据党的八届六中全会的精神，总结了黑龙江省1958年大跃进的经验，确定了全省今后工作。
    会议根据六中全会的精神和黑龙江省当前工作的情况，提出全省党组织和全省人民的任务是要继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，贯彻执行六中全会的决议和中央对东北地区工作的指示，根据国民经济必须按比例发展的客观法则，实现社会主义建设更大更好更全面的跃进，完成大力支援全国的任务，建设繁荣幸福的黑龙江省。
    会议根据上述精神规定了黑龙江省今后经济建设的主要任务。在工业生产建设方面，必须根据大力支援全国的要求，首先抓紧对机械工业的领导，充分挖掘潜力，加强协作，过好“重（型）、大（型）、精（密）、尖（端）”这一关，同时抓紧钢铁、煤炭和木材等生产，保证完成国家所规定的各项任务。另一方面必须积极地相适应地加强电力、交通、地质、轻工业和化学工业等薄弱部门。
    在农业方面，必须继续提高粮食单位面积产量和总产量，认真地全面地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”；同时要大力发展工业原料、油料作物、蔬菜、畜牧业、林业、副业、渔业等多种经营和社营工业，扩大商品性生产，逐步实现公社工业化和农业的机械化、电气化，并要在1959年建立一定的基础。随着生产的发展，要进一步改善人民的生活，保证工人、农民的实际收入逐年都有适当的增加。
    会议认真讨论了今后经济建设中贯彻“两条腿走路”方针的问题，认为过去几年黑龙江省国民经济各部门的发展基本上是互相适应的，但是随着工业，特别是重工业的发展，1958年工业产值已达到全省工农业总产值的63.1％；城市人口已达到全省总人口的41.6％。因此，在农业、轻工业和农业的多种经营这三个方面，今后必须在保证重点建设的同时，及早地采取措施，予以加强。
    会议强调指出，巩固和提高人民公社是一项极为重大的政治任务，各级党组织必须组织党员干部认真学习和贯彻执行八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，通过全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓分配、抓生活、抓组织、抓作风，切实在最近几个月内作好整社工作。
    这次会议强调指出必须加强党的领导、贯彻群众路线、提高思想、改进作风，认为这是胜利完成今后一切任务的根本保证。
    山　西
    本报太原22日电　中共山西省委员会1月2日到10日召开了全体会议。在这之前，举行了十天的预备会议。会议由省委第一书记陶鲁笳详细地传达了党的八届六中全会的决议和毛主席的指示，采取以虚带实、就实论虚、理论联系实际的方法，进行了充分的学习和讨论。会议总结了全省1958年社会主义建设大跃进的成绩和经验，确定了全省1959年国民经济发展的一些主要指标，作出了关于整顿和巩固人民公社的决议，研究了财贸和文教等项工作，并且全面地安排了今年第一季度的工作。
    会议认为，实现全省1959年钢、铁、粮、棉、油料等成倍地增长的跃进指标，客观的可能性是存在的。而这些指标就像长在树上的果子，站住不动是摘不着的，但是跳起来就可以摘到。为了把客观可能性变为现实性，会议十分强调抓第一季度的工作，并且认为必须正确贯彻执行党的八届六中全会所确定的一整套的发展国民经济的两条腿走路的方针，正确地处理六个关键性的问题：（一）工业，在全国一盘棋、以钢为纲、保证重点、保证完成生产任务的前提下，实行重工业和轻工业同时并举、重点和一般相结合、生产和基本建设相结合的两条腿走路的方针。必须经常调节它们之间的比例关系。（二）农业，在以粮为纲、保证完成农业生产的前提下，实行农业和林牧副渔并举、生产和基本建设并举、发展园田化农田和经营一般农田并举、公社农业和工业并举、自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，以求不断地促进农林牧副渔全线革命，不断地由低到高、由土到洋地促进农业的机械化、电气化。必须在林牧副渔方面同农业生产一样，分别找出像“八字宪法”的增产规律。（三）改变“先行”落后于“元帅”的状况，根据大中小相结合和土洋并举的方针，开展一个全党全民办交通、办电力工业的运动，以适应工业和农业更大跃进的需要。（四）恰当地分配劳动力，并且努力提高劳动力的利用率和劳动生产力，这是1959年工农业生产能否双胜利的关键所在。必须批判机械地静止地算死账的观点和办法，大力开展技术革命运动，把工具改革和改善劳动组织结合起来，把实干苦干和巧干结合起来，要使1959年一个工作日的效率等于1958年一个半甚至两个工作日的效率。（五）生产和生活是紧密联系而又相互促进的两个矛盾的事物，生产占主导地位，但在一定条件下生活又成为主要的问题。必须使所有干部懂得，工农业生产愈跃进，愈要关心群众生活，愈关心群众生活工农业生产就愈能大跃进。（六）为了保证1959年社会主义建设事业更大更好更全面地跃进，必须贯彻始终地进行多快好省和少慢差费两条路线的思想斗争。树立多快好省的全面观点。用已有的丰富经验和对自然界作斗争的科学知识，武装干部和群众的思想，防止和克服右倾保守思想。必须使群众运动和集中领导相结合，使发挥人的主观能动性和客观规律相结合，这样才能正确地贯彻党的群众路线，而收到多快好省的最大的效果。
    会议要求各级党委，把整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，当作当前党在农村的中心任务，并且要由第一书记挂帅，动员和组织大批干部投到运动中去，争取在今年4月底以前全部完成任务。在整社过程中，必须自始至终使整社与当前生产密切结合起来。这次整社，是一次学习和贯彻党的八届六中全会决议的运动，是一次更深入、更全面的社会主义和共产主义的教育运动，是一次有领导地处理人民公社的生产、生活、分配、经营管理等一系列问题的群众运动。经过这次整顿和巩固，人民公社的优越性将会更全面更充分地发挥出来，从而有力地促进全省工业、农业和其他各项社会主义建设事业更大的跃进。
    安徽
    本报合肥22日电　中共安徽省委于去年12月26日召开的四级干部会议，已经在1月16日结束。参加这次会议的，有人民公社以上各级党委负责干部共二千六百多人。
    会议根据六中全会决议的精神，认真研究了全面整顿人民公社的工作。认为整社的要求是：整顿思想作风；建立与健全各种组织制度；结合整社，做好生产和分配工作，搞好群众生活。整社的方法是：和生产紧密结合；重点试验，分批完成，要求在1月底结束重点试验，全面整社分两批进行，保证在4月底全部完成整社任务。
    会议认为整社大体可分为四步：第一步学习文件，安排当前生产、生活，做好分配工作和食堂工作，总结经验教训，在干部中开展批评和自我批评。第二步广泛向群众宣传六中全会精神，做到家喻户晓。在此基础上总结生产中的成绩和缺点，发动群众开展鸣放，边整边改。第三步健全组织，修订规章制度，制定经营管理办法，制定全年生产、生活计划。第四步是处理遗留问题，召开社员大会，选举干部，组织生产，开展竞赛。会议还指出，整社工作必须加强党的领导，党委第一书记应亲自挂帅。
    会议认为人民公社的管理要认真建立生产责任制，并且要贯彻民主集中制的原则，即“生活集体化、行动战斗化、组织军事化、管理民主化。”会议批判了把生产和生活割裂开来加以理解，以及那种把抓生活只看做是日常事务工作，无需领导人操心的错误认识。会议对人民公社的组织机构、对生产、财务、分配、生活等许多制度也进行了讨论，并作出了规定。
    会议对今年的生产工作进行了认真的讨论，一致认为安徽省1958年的工农业生产获得空前的发展。其他各项工作也都取得了很大的成绩。今年是苦战三年中有决定意义的一年，一定要争取更大更全面的跃进。为了保证完成今年的任务，会议认为，必须继续反对保守，破除迷信，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，贯彻执行中央提出的四个并举、用“两条腿走路”的方针。会议特别强调指出，根据过去的经验，特别是1958年大跃进的经验证明，合理安排和使用劳动力，降低劳动强度，提高劳动效率，是发展各项生产建设事业的基本关键。因此，必须千方百计地提高劳动效率。为此，必须合理安排劳动力，做好劳动力的调配工作；改进劳动组织，制定劳动定额，消除窝工现象；在各项建设事业中做到合理布局；在工业、农业、交通运输、商业、炊事业各部门各行业各车间的各种劳动中，开展全面的技术革新和工具改革运动。
