Leading Cadres Go Deep Layer by Layer
Rectifying Communes with Key Points Driving the Whole Area

    (Our dispatch) The CCP Phoenix County Committee of Hunan Province has adopted the leadership method of leading by example, going deep layer by layer, implementing "three togethers," and using key points to drive the whole area, further rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. In early December last year, all three county party secretaries and seven county committee members went down separately, grasping both key points and the overall situation.
    After County Party First Secretary Zhang Zhimin arrived at the Second Production Team of the Linfeng People's Commune and found that some people had thin clothing and bedding, he suggested that the commune quickly make ten new cotton quilts and several new cotton-padded clothes. That evening, Secretary Zhang called the County Party Committee Office and instructed all people's communes to conscientiously check and solve the problem of winter cotton clothing and bedding for commune members. Therefore, the lives of the masses have generally received care.
    During the inspection, Zhang Zhimin also helped the Commune Party Committee here improve its leadership methods to adapt to the new situation of the comprehensive great leap forward in industry and agriculture. This is to adopt a new leadership method of "three divisions" (division of battle lines, division of labor, and decentralized management at the commune and brigade levels) and "one guarantee" (guaranteed responsibility) with the secretary taking the lead, and establish a system of regular inspection, summary, investigation, and visits. In this way, eleven of the seventeen cadres in the whole commune went down to the production team, everyone had a focus, and the work was quickly grasped in an all-round way.
    After the leading cadres went deep layer by layer, they also solved some specific problems in a timely manner. Tian Maoshun, Secretary of the Xinyang People's Commune Party Committee, led eighteen cadres, carrying baskets, to inspect and re-harvest tung trees and sweet potato fields in the Tonglinli and sweet potato fields of the Ciyan Production Brigade. In three hours, they picked up 520 jin of tung seeds and 150 jin of sweet potatoes. The next day, the entire commune mobilized more than 3,000 people to re-dig and re-harvest, and in one day picked up 634 dan of tung seeds and more than 18,000 jin of sweet potatoes. (Meng Fanqin)

    领导干部层层深入
    以点带面整顿公社
    本报讯　中共湖南省凤凰县委采取领导带头，层层深入，实行“三同”，以点带面的领导方法，进一步整顿和巩固了人民公社。去年12月初，全县三个县委书记，七个县委委员都分头下去，既抓重点，又抓全面。
    县委第一书记张志敏到林峰人民公社第二生产小队后，发现有些人衣被单薄，便建议公社很快做了十床新棉被和几件新棉衣，当晚，张书记就打电话给县委办公室，布置各人民公社认真检查和解决社员的过冬棉衣棉被问题，因此，群众的生活普遍受到关怀。
    张志敏在检查中，还帮助了这里的公社党委会改进了领导方法，以适应工农业全面大跃进的新形势。这就是采取书记挂帅，实行“三分”（分战线、分工、社队分级分权管理）一包（包干负责）的新的领导方法，并建立了定期检查总结、调查访问的制度。这样全社十七个干部有十一个下到生产小队，人人有重点，工作很快全面抓起来了。
    领导干部层层深入下去后，也及时解决了一些具体问题。新扬人民公社党委书记田茂顺带领十八个干部，挑着箩筐，在茨岩生产大队的桐林里和红薯地里，边检查、边复收，三小时捡得桐子五百二十斤，红薯一百五十多斤。第二天，全公社出动三千多人复挖复收，一天捡回桐子六百三十四担，红薯一万八千多斤。　（孟繁勤）
