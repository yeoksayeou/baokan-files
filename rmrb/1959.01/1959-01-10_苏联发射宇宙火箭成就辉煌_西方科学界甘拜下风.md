Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: According to TASS, scientists in Western countries continue to comment with admiration on the Soviet Union's great achievement in launching a space rocket.

    British physicist Professor Powell of the University of Bristol, a Nobel Prize winner, said that British technologists are surprised by the power and accuracy of Soviet artificial earth satellites and space rockets. He said that the Soviet achievements are the beginning of space research. These achievements open up many exciting prospects, indicating that the days when humans can land on the moon and some other planets are not far away.

    Professor Kopal, an astronomy professor at the University of Manchester, said that in terms of high-altitude rocket flights and interstellar travel, Soviet scientists and engineers have greatly surpassed their Western counterparts. He believes that the data collected after the Soviet rocket launch will be very valuable to scientists around the world.

    Professor Rotblat, a physics professor at the University of London, said when talking about his feelings about the launch of the space rocket: "The news of this latest achievement excites me the most. What scientists have dreamed of but were not sure of achieving is now a reality." He believes that Soviet scientists have made great achievements in this area, and only organized science can achieve such achievements. He said, I think if science all over the world were organized in this way, then greater progress would be made and benefit all mankind.

    Smith, the science commentator of the British "Daily Telegraph," marveled at the degree of precision achieved by Soviet scientists in the process of launching the space rocket, and pointed out: "It is more valuable for the rocket to maintain the closest distance to the moon than for the rocket to land on the moon, because this provides an opportunity to conduct probes when the rocket approaches the moon and when the rocket flies through the lunar region. If the rocket makes direct contact with the moon, it will interrupt the work of collecting information, and therefore there will be no particular benefit." Babor, the science commentator for the Associated Press, pointed out that the Soviet space rocket completed the scientific mission assigned to it. He quoted American scientist Friedman as saying that the launch of the space rocket "proves that the Russians have extraordinary abilities in controlling interplanetary spacecraft."

    West German rocket expert Glettorp said on the 7th that from the fact that the Soviet space rocket was able to pass through "an unexpectedly close distance from the moon," it can be concluded that the Soviet Union "has mastered highly developed control technology."

    Dr. Kuiper, chairman of the Dutch Interstellar Aviation Association, told the "Telegraph" that the launch of the Soviet space rocket was "the beginning of interplanetary travel." He expressed regret that Western countries had not achieved such success. Professor Oort, director of the Leiden Observatory, said: "There is no doubt that this achievement will enrich astronomy with new and important data. I must say that Russia is once again leading in mastering the second stage of interplanetary travel."

    Professor Adamopoulos, director of the Athens Observatory, and Professor Hatzabis, director of another observatory near Athens, believe that the flight of the Soviet space rocket in space is a historic event.

    苏联发射宇宙火箭成就辉煌
    西方科学界甘拜下风
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社消息：西方国家科学界人士继续以敬佩的心情评论苏联发射宇宙火箭的巨大成就。
    英国布利斯托尔大学物理学教授、诺贝尔奖金获得者鲍威尔说，英国科技界人士对苏联人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭的威力和准确性感到吃惊。他说，苏联的成就是研究宇宙的开端。这些成就打开了许多令人振奋的远景，它说明人类能够在月球和其他一些行星着陆的日子已经不远了。
    曼彻斯特大学天文学教授柯帕尔说，在高空火箭飞行和星际航行方面，苏联科学家和工程师大大超过了他们的西方同行。他认为，苏联火箭发射以后所搜集的资料对全世界的科学家将是十分宝贵的。
    伦敦大学物理学教授罗特布拉特在谈他对发射宇宙火箭的感想时说：“这个最新成就的消息使我最为激动。科学家所幻想的但是又没有把握实现的事情，现在成为现实了。”他认为，苏联科学家在这方面取得了巨大的成就，只有有组织的科学才能取得这样的成就。他说，我认为，假如全世界的科学都这样组织起来，那时就会取得更大的进步，而为全人类造福。
    英国“每日电讯报”的科学评论员史密斯惊叹苏联科学家在发射宇宙火箭过程中所达到的精确程度，并且指出：“火箭与月球保持最近距离运行时比火箭降落在月球上更有价值，因为这样就有机会在火箭接近月球和火箭飞过月球区域时进行测探。而如果火箭和月球直接接触就会使收集情报的工作中断，因之不会有什么特别的好处。”美联社科学评论员巴波尔指出，苏联宇宙火箭完成了赋予它的科学任务。他援引了美国科学家弗里德曼的谈话，弗里德曼说，发射宇宙火箭“证明俄国人在控制行星际飞船方面有非凡的才能”。
    西德火箭专家格列特鲁普7日说，从苏联宇宙火箭能在“离月球料想不到的近处”通过这一点可以得出结论：苏联“掌握了高度发达的控制技术”。
    荷兰星际航空协会主席库伊博士对“电讯报”发表谈话说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射是“行星际旅行的开端”。他对西方国家没有获得这样的成就表示遗憾。莱顿天文台台长奥尔特教授说：“毫无疑问，这一成就将以新的重要的资料丰富天文学。我应当说，在掌握行星际旅行的第二阶段，俄国再一次领先。”
  雅典天文台的台长阿达莫普罗斯教授和雅典附近另一个天文台的台长哈萨比斯认为，苏联宇宙火箭在太空的飞行是一个有历史意义的事件。
