Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 12th: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today, firmly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government's aggressive attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the objective pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan and the U.S. government in the recent talks on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" completely violates the demands of the Japanese people. The statement said: "The U.S. imperialists are attempting to turn Japan into their permanent military base by revising the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' drag Japan into a dangerous nuclear war, and attempt to use the resurrected Japanese militarism as a new tool of aggression against the Asian people."

The statement said: "The Kishi Nobusuke government is actively participating in this aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism in order to further promote the revival of Japanese militarism and further attempt to invade many Asian countries." "All these facts show that U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government are attempting to put Japan on the path of revanchism."

The statement said: "This will not only bring great misfortune and disaster to the Japanese people, but it is also a direct threat to the Korean people and is completely incompatible with peace and security in the Far East."

The statement said: "The Korean people clearly remember the national misfortune and suffering they suffered under the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism in the past, and they also remember the fact that during the Korean War, the Japanese government allowed U.S. imperialism to use Japanese territory as a springboard for aggression against Korea and directly helped U.S. imperialism carry out aggression."

The statement emphasized that the Korean people feel great anger at the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy with U.S. imperialists to carry out aggression against the Asian people, including the Korean people.

The statement said: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea firmly condemns the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government for their aggressive attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in order to make Japan a springboard for a new war and to revive Japanese militarism to make it the gendarme of Asia.

The statement expressed that the Korean people warmly support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. occupation of Japan and for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
