Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): TASS science correspondent reports: The Soviet space rocket has now left its starting position in Earth orbit by 30 million kilometers. The spherical marker on this interplanetary ship, as a symbol of the first artificial planet, proves that the fantasies of Soviet scientists have been brilliantly realized.

The launching of the Soviet interplanetary ship, which has become an artificial planet, is a huge qualitative leap in the development of rocket technology. The second cosmic velocity (11.2 kilometers per second) necessary to overcome the Earth's gravity is 40 percent greater than the first cosmic velocity (8 kilometers per second, with which an object can become an Earth satellite).

Calculations show that the amount of fuel required for the rocket to reach the second cosmic velocity should be increased accordingly. In addition, it should be considered that the artificial planet, weighing almost one and a half tons, is more than 150 kilograms heavier than the largest artificial Earth satellite - the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite. It is worth recalling that in order to launch an artificial satellite (Explorer) weighing only 14 kilograms together with its carrier rocket, the United States used a rocket system equivalent in size to a train carriage.

Calculations also show that in order to reach the second cosmic velocity, the thrust of the last stage of the space rocket should exceed 160,000 kilowatts, which is equivalent to the power of a large power station.

Of course, careful preparation for such a huge leap forward takes a lot of time. The fact that more than seven and a half months have passed since the completion of the third artificial Earth satellite proves that Soviet scientists and engineers were not overly hasty, nor did they rush ahead of the United States in launching a lunar rocket at any cost, even at the cost of failure.

With an increase of only 200 meters per second in the speed already achieved, the Soviet space rocket would be sufficient to fly to Mars.

It is not difficult to predict that, at the current rate of development of Soviet rocket technology, flights to Venus and Mars can be realized in the near future.

    宇宙火箭已离地三千万公里
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：塔斯社科学记者报道，现在苏联宇宙火箭已离地球轨道上的出发位置三千万公里。这个行星际飞船上作为第一个人造行星象征的球形标记，证明苏联科学家的幻想得到光辉的实现。
    已经变为人造行星的苏联行星际飞船的发射，是火箭技术发展的巨大的质的飞跃。为克服地球引力所必需的第二宇宙速度（每秒钟十一点二公里）比第一宇宙速度（每秒钟八公里，具有这样速度的物体就可以成为地球卫星）大百分之四十。
    计算表明，火箭为达到第二宇宙速度所必需的燃料数量要相应地增加。此外，应该考虑到，几乎有一吨半重的人造行星比最大的人造地球卫星——苏联第三个人造地球卫星还要重一百五十多公斤。这里提醒一下，美国为了发射一个连同运载火箭一起只有十四公斤重的人造卫星（探险者），就使用了一个相当于火车车厢这样大的火箭系统。
    计算还表明，为了达到第二宇宙速度，宇宙火箭最后一级的推力应该超过十六万瓩，即相当于一个大发电站的功率。
    当然，周密准备这样一个巨大的跃进是需要不少时间的。从第三个人造地球卫星制成以后过了七个半月以上的时间，这一点证明，苏联科学家和工程师并没有过分匆忙的情形，也没有不惜任何代价，甚至是失败的代价来在发射月球火箭方面赶在美国前面。
    只要在实际已达到的速度上再增加每秒二百公尺，苏联宇宙火箭就足以飞向火星了。
    不难预测，在苏联火箭技术目前的发展速度下，不久的将来即可实现向金星和火星方向的飞行。
