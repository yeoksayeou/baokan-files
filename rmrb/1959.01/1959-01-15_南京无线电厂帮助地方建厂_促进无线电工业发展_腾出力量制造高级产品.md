    Nanjing Radio Factory Helps Local Factories to Promote the Development of the Radio Industry and Free Up Strength to Manufacture Advanced Products

    (Our Dispatch) The state-owned Nanjing Radio Factory has adopted the method of "sowing seeds everywhere" to rapidly develop a number of local radio factories, while freeing up strength to trial-produce and manufacture advanced radio products.

    Since July of last year, under the leadership of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Nanjing Radio Factory has helped three districts in the city establish six radio component manufacturing plants, one complete machine assembly plant, and twelve resident processing groups. Most of these factories and resident processing groups have been put into production, with more than 2,000 people participating in production. The products include more than ten types such as carbon resistors, potentiometers, mica capacitors, instruments, and meters. Now, the Nanjing Radio Factory has begun to gradually hand over all the production tasks of five-tube radios to local factories, freeing up a large number of technical personnel to produce premium radios, car radios, and various modern radio communication equipment. Once they master the production technology of these new products, they plan to gradually hand over some advanced radio products to local factories for production. With a batch of local radio factories, they can continue to expand and improve. In the process of building factories, the Nanjing Radio Factory has done everything possible to extract all the equipment or special equipment used for the original production of parts in its own factory to support local factories. After the factories were established, they also extracted all the workers, technicians, or some key workers who produced certain parts and sent them to local factories to continue to maintain the production of parts, and cultivate technical forces for local factories in production. Some of the workers and technicians sent to local factories will gradually be transferred back to the factory after the local factories have mastered all the production technologies, some will stay in the local factories, and some will take care of both ends. In the initial stage of putting the new factory into production, as a branch of the Nanjing Radio Factory, the economy is not independently accounted for, and the production management, raw material supply, and finished products are all the responsibility of the general factory. The new factory is under the dual leadership of the general factory and the local party committee. When the production is on the right track, it will be handed over to the local party committee for leadership.

    The Nanjing Radio Factory's method of developing the radio industry by sowing seeds everywhere and climbing the stairs step by step has achieved three perfect results: it is good for the country, for state-owned factories, and for the local area.

    First of all, it has developed the radio industry for the country in a more, faster, better and more economical way. The batch of radio factories established by the Nanjing Radio Factory to help the local area, some of them took only a few days to one or two months from preparation to putting into production, and the total investment was only more than 100,000 yuan. The mica capacitor factory, thanks to the help of the mica capacitor section of the Nanjing Radio Factory, quickly installed the equipment and put it into production. In the past, the Nanjing Radio Factory relied on the supply of parts such as speakers and magnetic porcelain from other places. This time, it also established factories to produce these parts in cooperation with local areas. If the state wants to build a new radio parts factory with the production capacity of this batch of small factories, it will take two or three years and an investment of tens of millions of yuan.

    Secondly, the Nanjing Radio Factory has found a concrete way to popularize and improve the radio industry. In the past few years, because they produced general products such as radios, they held back a large number of technical personnel and could not trial-produce and produce more advanced radio products. Now, with a batch of local factories, the factory can produce more advanced products this year, and the output value will double that of last year.

    Thirdly, it has fully stimulated the enthusiasm of local areas to run factories. As early as two years ago, Xuanwu District had a plan to build a radio factory. In 1957, due to the lack of equipment and technical strength, only a radio repair group of five or six people was established. Last year, with the help of the Nanjing Radio Factory, they actively equipped cadres, vacated houses, and transferred labor from the society, and quickly established a radio assembly plant, an electric meter instrument plant, a resistor and potentiometer plant, and many resident processing groups.

### 南京无线电厂帮助地方建厂  促进无线电工业发展　腾出力量制造高级产品

    南京无线电厂帮助地方建厂
    促进无线电工业发展　腾出力量制造高级产品
    本报讯　国营南京无线电厂采取“遍地播种”的方法，迅速发展了一批地方无线电工厂，同时腾出力量试制和生产高级无线电产品。
    南京无线电厂从去年7月份以来，在中共南京市委领导下，帮助市内三个区建立了六个无线电零件制造厂、一个整机装配厂和十二个居民加工组。这批工厂和居民加工组大部分已投入生产，参加生产的有两千多人，产品有炭阻、电位器、云母电容器、仪表、电表等十多种。现在南京无线电厂开始逐步将五灯收音机的生产任务全部交地方工厂，腾出大批技术力量生产特级收音机、汽车用收音机和各种现代无线电通讯设备。他们一旦掌握了这些新产品的生产技术，准备再逐步将一些高级无线电产品交地方工厂生产。地方有了一批无线电工厂，又可以不断扩大和提高。在建厂过程中，南京无线电厂曾尽一切可能抽出本厂原来生产零件所用的全部设备或专用设备支援地方工厂。当工厂建立起来以后，他们又抽出生产某种零件的全部工人、技术人员或一部分骨干工人派到地方工厂，一面继续维持零件生产，一面在生产中为地方工厂培养技术力量。派到地方工厂的工人、技术人员有的待地方工厂掌握了全部生产技术，再逐步调回本厂，有的留在地方工厂，有的两头兼顾。新建工厂投入生产的初期，作为南京无线电厂的分厂，经济不单独核算，生产管理、原材料供应和成品都由总厂负责。新建工厂受总厂和当地党委双重领导。当生产走上正轨，即交当地党委领导。
    南京无线电厂这种遍地播种、步步上楼发展无线电工业的办法，达到三全其美的效果：对国家、对国营工厂、对地方都有好处。
    首先，多快好省地为国家发展了无线电工业。南京无线电厂帮助地方建立的这批无线电工厂，有些从筹备到投入生产只有几天到一、两个月，全部投资只有十多万元。云母电容器厂由于得到南京无线电厂云母电容器工段的帮助，很快就把设备安装好了，并且投入了生产。南京无线电厂过去依赖外地供应喇叭、磁性瓷等零件，这次和地方协作也建立了生产这些零件的工厂。如果国家要新建一个像这批小型厂生产能力的无线电零件厂，需要二、三年时间，投资几千万元。
    其次，南京无线电厂找到了无线电工业普及和提高的具体道路。几年来，他们由于生产收音机等一般产品，牵住了大批技术力量，无法试制和生产更高级的无线电产品，现在有了一批地方工厂，今年厂内就可以生产更高级的产品，产值将比去年翻两番。
    第三，充分发挥了地方办工厂的积极性。玄武区早在二年前就有办无线电厂的计划，1957年由于缺乏设备和技术力量，只办起一个五、六人的无线电修理组。去年在南京无线电厂的帮助下，他们积极配备干部，腾出房屋，从社会上调配劳动力，很快建立了收音机装配厂、电表仪表厂、电阻、电位器厂和许多居民加工组。
