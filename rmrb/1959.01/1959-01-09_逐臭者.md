    Those Who Chase After Stench
    Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals vigorously promote the "hula hoop dance," spreading the "American way of life." A new dance is popular in America, a hoop套套 around the body, men and women like madmen, twisting their butts and jumping all over the street. Obscene, crazy and erotic, a hundred ugly gestures, really disgusting; fighting here and making trouble there, a vivid picture of Western civilization. Those who chase after stench are everywhere, going wherever it stinks, like flies seeing dung, calling it flowers and fine wine. Newspapers and magazines all introduce it, promoting it with fanfare, some introduce its history, some introduce how to dance it. Some propaganda is even more shameless, calling it a "youth stimulant." Cinemas show documentaries, calling on everyone to learn. Originally they are all birds of a feather, the stench is the same, needless to say, it's ridiculous that they still pretend to be serious, unwilling to tear off their paper faces.

    逐臭者
    南斯拉夫报刊大力宣扬“呼拉圈舞”，传播“美国生活方式”。美国流行新舞蹈，一个圈儿身上套，男男女女像发疯，扭着屁股满街跳。肉麻疯狂加色情，丑态百出真恶心；这里打架那里闹，西方文明活现形。逐臭之夫到处有，哪里越臭哪里走，好比苍蝇见大粪，说是鲜花与美酒。报纸画刊都介绍，吹吹打打很热闹，有的介绍发展史，有的介绍怎样跳。有的宣传更无耻，说是“青春兴奋剂”。影院上演纪录片，号召大家来学习。原本就是一路货，臭味相同不用说，可笑还要装正经，不肯扯下纸脸壳。
