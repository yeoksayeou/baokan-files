Title: Dulles' Tears Cannot Deceive

In 1958, it could be considered the year when the Western fools, led by Dulles, most rampantly clamored and retaliated against the socialist camp, and it was also the year when their hostility and slander against the Chinese people reached their peak. After our country realized communization nationwide, they became even more frantic, feeling insecure all day long, and spitting all kinds of slander at the people's communes. In Dulles's view, the emergence of people's communes in our country and the great leap forward in our socialist construction were "destroying families," "slave labor," destroying graves, and disrespecting ancestors, and so on. Thus, the robber actually showed mercy, tears flowed straight down, and he wailed to the heavens as if mourning his parents, and the farce became more and more intense.

In fact, we are not at all surprised by this.

It is not new to scold us communists for "destroying families." The Communist Manifesto refuted this curse long ago.

What we are destroying is only the feudal patriarchal system, but we are not destroying families. On the contrary, we want to establish thousands upon thousands of new, democratic, and united families.

Speaking of the feudal patriarchal system, it has generally been destroyed in capitalist society long ago. However, after its destruction, a capitalist family with naked monetary relations as its content was established. As the Communist Manifesto pointed out: "On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the enforced celibacy of the proletarians and in public prostitution."

Isn't this exactly the case?

According to American bourgeois sociologist Williams, the characteristic of American society is a large number of divorces. There are many families without children. Kinship obligations are poorly observed. The divorce rate (calculated based on the average number of marriages per year over the past ten years) increased from 6% in 1890 to 40% in 1947.

In 1948, there was an advertisement in the American "News Report": "A woman is for sale, divorced, blonde, seductive and charming, now seeking a husband; anyone willing to support her and her two children can marry her, and those who are willing must agree to these conditions and immediately pay 10,000 US dollars."

Among the many shocking events in the United States, this is also one:

"Two American children (one nine years old and one thirteen years old) killed their eleven-year-old sister, stole $150 from their parents, and then fled to a hotel for a few days. The children's father actually used this opportunity to make money. He took a picture with the two young murderers and sold the picture to bourgeois hawkers who were obsessed with shocking news." ("Learning Translation Series" No. 3, 1955)

These are the family situations in American social life that Dulles and his ilk constantly boast about.

Can it be said that this family situation in American social life is a "reasonable" phenomenon? Can it be said that the cheap tears shed by Dulles on the family issue are not more appropriate to be shed in the United States?

Dulles also said, you are practicing "slave labor"!

This is not only a slander against the Chinese people, but also exposes the faces of Dulles and his ilk.

Slave labor does exist in the world: in feudal society, peasants are slaves of the landlord class; in capitalist society, workers are slaves of the bourgeoisie.

In the eyes of slave owners, in the eyes of imperialists represented by Dulles, everyone in the world is their slave, everyone's labor is slave labor, and all the fruits of labor, all the gold and silver treasures created from labor, should be put into their pockets.

This reminds me of a passage from Gorky's article entitled "A Great King of the Republic":

This great king, whose "pocket is like a big hole, where you can hide churches, senate halls and all necessities at will...

"He has a pair of long, retractable hands that can hold the entire earth, bring it close to a huge, dark mouth, suck, bite, and chew our planet, with greedy saliva on it, like sprayed on a hot roasted sweet potato..."

Isn't the so-called "slave labor" exactly Dulles painting his own face on others?

As for the emergence of people's communes, as for the doubling of our country's steel production in one year, the road that the United States took seven years to complete, and the United Kingdom took thirty-two years, we only need one year. The mystery is nothing else. Fundamentally speaking, it is precisely because our labor is free labor, creative labor, and the labor of masters, so that our labor productivity is beyond the reach of feudal society and also beyond the reach of capitalist society!

Although Dulles has repeatedly slandered the labor of our people as "slave labor," even Dulles cannot point out where the slave owners are in our country? This "slave labor" without slave owners proves one thing in reverse: that more than 600 million people in our country are all masters of labor! The wealth created by the laborers belongs to all the laborers themselves. Can this be done except in socialist countries?

Dulles suddenly developed "compassion" for our country's graves and our country's dead.

However, the Chinese people still have basic memories and are not too forgetful. The imperialists and domestic reactionaries, linked together, have slaughtered hundreds, thousands, and tens of of thousands of our country's revolutionaries. Mr. Dulles, your hands are stained with the blood of the Chinese people! Your hypocritical tears for our country's graves cannot deceive anyone. Your "compassion" is misplaced in our China. Our people are living a hot, prosperous life, and this is precisely the result of driving you away. The good people of America are at risk of death and unemployment at any time, and you cannot escape this responsibility!

    杜勒斯的眼泪骗不了人
    马铁丁
    1958年，大约可算得是以杜勒斯为首的西方蠢人们对社会主义阵营叫嚣、反噬得最猖獗的一年，也是他们对中国人民的敌视和污蔑达到顶峰的一年。当我国在全国范围内实现了公社化以后，他们更是如疯似狂，惶惶不可终日，对人民公社吐尽了唾沫。在杜勒斯看来：我国人民公社的出现、我国社会主义建设事业的大跃进是“破坏家庭”，“奴隶劳动”，破坏坟墓、不尊敬祖先云云。于是，强盗居然也发了慈悲，眼泪直泻，抢地呼天，如丧考妣，丑剧也就愈演愈烈了。
    其实，他们这一套，我们一点也不奇怪。
    骂我们共产党人“破坏家庭”，并不新鲜，共产党宣言中早就对这种诅咒驳斥过。
    我们所破坏的，仅仅是封建性的家长制，可并不是破坏家庭。正相反，我们要建立千千万万个民主团结的新家庭。
    说到封建性的家长制，在资本主义社会一般地早就破坏了。可是，在破坏了之后，建立了以赤裸裸的金钱关系为内容的资本主义家庭。正像共产党宣言上所指出的：“现代的资产阶级的家庭是建筑在什么东西上面的呢？是建筑在资本上面，建筑在私人发财制度上面的。这种家庭的完备发展形态，只有在资产阶级中间才存在着；而它的补充现象却是无产者的被迫独居生活和公娼制。”
    事实难道不正是这样吗？
    照美国资产阶级社会学家威廉斯的话说，美国社会的特点是大量离婚。没有子女的家庭很多。亲属义务遵守得很差。离婚率（以最近十年来每年结婚平均数计算）从1890年的6％提高到1947年的40％。
    1948年美国“新闻报”上有过这末一条启事：“兹有妇女一名出售，已离婚，发色金黄，诱惑迷人，现征求丈夫；凡愿赡养其本人及其小孩二人者，均可与其结婚，愿者须同意此项条件并需立即交付美金一万元。”
    在美国大量骇人听闻的事件中，这也是一件：
      “有两个美国小孩（一个九岁，一个十三岁）杀死了自己十一岁的姐妹，偷了父母一百五十块美元，然后逃到饭店去住了几天。小孩的父亲竟利用这个机会来赚钱，他和这两个年幼的凶手合照了一张像片，并把这张像片卖给醉心于惊人消息的资产阶级报贩子。”（“学习译丛”1955年第三期）
    这些就是杜勒斯之流不断吹嘘的美国社会生活中的家庭状况。
    难道说，美国社会生活中的这种家庭状况，是什么“合理”的现象吗？难道说，在家庭问题上，杜勒斯所倾洒的廉价的眼泪，不是洒在美国更为确当些吗？
    杜勒斯又说，你们实行“奴隶劳动”啊！
    这不仅是对中国人民的诬蔑，而且也暴露出杜勒斯们自己的嘴脸。
    世界上的奴隶劳动确实是存在的：在封建社会，农民是地主阶级的奴隶；在资本主义社会，工人是资产阶级的奴隶。
    在奴隶主看来，在以杜勒斯为代表的帝国主义者看来，世界上的一切人都是它的奴隶，世界上一切人的劳动都是奴隶劳动，世界上所有劳动的成果，所有从劳动中创造出来的金银财宝，都应该装进他们的荷包。
    这使我想起高尔基在题为“共和国的一个大王”文章中的一段描写：
    这位大王，它的“口袋像一个大洞，可以随便把教堂、参议院大厅和一切必需品藏到那里去……
      “它有一双伸缩自如的长手，可以把整个地球抱着、把地球挨近有一个巨大的、黑暗的嘴巴，把我们的行星吮吸着、咬着和咀嚼着，它那贪婪的唾液在它上面，像喷在一块热腾腾的烤白薯上面一样……”
    所谓“奴隶劳动”云云，难道不正是杜勒斯以自己的尊容画他人的面貌吗？
    至于人民公社的出现，至于我国钢产量在一年之内翻了一番，美国用七年的时间、英国用三十二年的时间所走完的路程，我们只要用一年时间。那奥妙并非别的，从根本上说，正是由于我们的劳动，是自由的劳动，创造性的劳动，主人翁的劳动，从而使我们的劳动生产率是封建社会所望尘莫及、也是资本主义社会所望尘莫及！
    杜勒斯虽然一再诬蔑我国人民的劳动是“奴隶劳动”，可是就连杜勒斯也无法指出在我国究竟奴隶主在那里？这没有奴隶主的“奴隶劳动”，却好反证一件事：我国六亿多人民，个个都是劳动的主人！劳动者所创造的财富，都归于全体劳动者自己，除了社会主义国家，能做到这样吗？
    对于我国的坟墓、对于我国的死人，杜勒斯忽然起了“恻?之心”了。
    但是，中国人民还有起码的记忆，并不是过于健忘的。帝国主义者和国内的反动派连结在一起，曾经成百、成千、成万地屠杀我国的革命者，杜勒斯先生，你的手上就染有中国人民的鲜血！你对我国坟墓的假惺惺的流泪，是骗不了什么人的。你的“恻?之心”用在我们中国那是用错了地方，我国人民正过着热腾腾、欣欣向荣的生活，这也正是把你们赶跑了的结果。美国的善良的活人们，随时都有死亡和失业的危险，你是逃避不了这个责任的！
