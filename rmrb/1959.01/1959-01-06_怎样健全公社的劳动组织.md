How to Improve the Labor Organization of the Commune
Pan Qinnong, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Dali County Committee, Shaanxi Province

In December of last year, the No. 1 Production Brigade of the Qiangbai People's Commune in Dali County began a socialist and communist ideological education campaign and a campaign to rectify the people's commune. During this movement, the work team, combined with the ideological education of the commune members, earnestly rectified the chaotic phenomena existing in the labor organization, and formulated a new set of labor management methods and systems according to the local actual situation and the commune's production policy. Practice has proved that this method is suitable for the new type of organization of the people's commune, and is also universally welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. The following is an introduction to the rectification of the labor organization in this brigade.

This brigade is divided into ten production teams, including twelve natural villages and 881 households. Due to the small population and large land area, each laborer cultivates an average of 11 mu of land, and each draft animal cultivates 44 mu. In the past, the local masses felt the difficulty of insufficient labor and animal power. After communization, industrial production and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries were carried out simultaneously, and various production targets and measures were increased, which made the difficulty of insufficient rural labor more serious, and there often occurred situations where there were many jobs but no one to do them.

Investigation and Debate

Solving the problem of labor organization is the key to carrying out various productions. In order to consolidate the people's commune and ensure the completion of various production increase tasks, the work team conducted a thorough investigation of the rural labor situation in various villages. The investigation showed that the labor shortage was mainly caused by improper labor arrangements, lax organization and management, and excessive labor occupied by service production (and many strong laborers doing light work). In order to unify understanding and clarify the key to the problem, the work team adopted the method of going from inside the Party to outside the Party, and from leaders to the masses, and classified and sorted out the problems raised by the commune members for discussion. After the cadres and commune members made extensive comments and debates, they unified their thinking, improved their understanding, and found solutions. Everyone agreed that industrial and agricultural production must be carried out simultaneously, production increase tasks must be guaranteed to be completed, and in addition to strengthening labor management, a large-scale tool reform movement must be carried out to solve the problem of labor shortage.

Rational Organization of Labor Force

According to the characteristics of the People's Commune having a large population and a wide range of operations, the work team, in accordance with the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, implemented the production policy of combining industry and agriculture, and combining self-sufficiency production and commodity production, and made unified arrangements for the entire team's labor force: it was initially determined to extract 208 laborers this year (accounting for 10% of the total labor force) as a long-term reserve force to support national industrial construction; extract 174 laborers (accounting for 7% of the total labor force) to ensure the needs of the commune and brigade's industrial enterprises; and the remaining 1,726 laborers (accounting for 83% of the total labor force) were rationally arranged by the brigade to each production team.

In the spirit of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and responsibility at all levels, and in accordance with the characteristics of the production team, the labor force was rationally divided and specialized. The specific methods were: to organize commune members with more experience, high technology, and fine cultivation into three specialized teams for grain, cotton, and horticulture respectively. This part of the labor force accounted for 34% of the total labor force, and its task was mainly to ensure the completion of various specialized production tasks. Secondly, establish specialized organizations for breeding and collective life welfare. And the method of quota management was implemented to save a large number of labor forces. At the same time, in these specialized organizations, try to replace men with women and the weak with the strong as much as possible, so that the agricultural production front can always maintain a large number and strong industrial army to ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks. In addition, each production team also organized a shock brigade. Usually, they fought side by side with the agricultural industrial army in their own team and produced together, under the unified leadership of the production team; when necessary, the production brigade uniformly transferred them according to the needs of the assault, and formed a large corps to fight.

In order to combine the assault and regular tasks in a planned way, the production brigade and the production team signed contracts with the assault team and the grain, cotton, and horticulture specialized teams, and then uniformly arranged and carried out the assault in stages, so as to ensure the completion of the production tasks of the grain and cotton specialized teams, and also to ensure the completion of the assault tasks.

Improve the Production Responsibility System

While organizing the labor organization, it is also necessary to establish and improve the corresponding production responsibility system. The work team assisted this brigade in preliminarily figuring out the following methods:

First, the production team and the production brigade implement the "five guarantees" system, namely, guaranteeing the completion of the sown area of crops; guaranteeing the realization of production increase targets; guaranteeing the rational use of investment; guaranteeing the comprehensive implementation of production increase measures; and guaranteeing the completion of planned labor tasks for crops. With the five guarantees as the content, the production team and the production brigade signed a contract, and the production team was fully responsible to the production brigade.

Second, the production team implements a professional responsibility system, that is, the production team organizes the commune members into grain professional teams, cotton professional teams, and horticulture professional teams in the team according to the "five guarantees" tasks contracted to the production brigade. Each professional team contracts the production tasks of one or two crops according to the "five guarantees" requirements. There must be a clear division of responsibilities, close cooperation, and mutual support between teams; it is necessary to ensure the completion of the contracted tasks and also to ensure the completion of various tasks of the entire production team.

Third, the cadres of the production team implement a leadership responsibility system of unified leadership, division of responsibilities, close cooperation, and each being responsible for their own duties. Responsibilities are clearly divided at each level, and everyone completes their tasks.

Fourth, commune members implement a four-fixed responsibility system in cultivation, namely, fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing projects, and fixing time. In management, a four-to-the-field management responsibility system is implemented, namely, indicators to the field, measures to the field, responsibilities to the field, and management to the field. In addition to the above-mentioned responsibility systems, the team cadres also stipulated the management responsibility system of "three grasps," "four to the field," and "six unifications" (three grasps are grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life; four to the field are labor to the field, office work to the field, inspection to the field, and evaluation to the field; six unifications are unifying ideological leadership, unifying planning arrangements, unifying labor deployment, unifying labor competitions, unifying summarizing and exchanging experience, and unifying evaluation, comparison, and reward and punishment systems). These systems, after a short period of practice, have greatly promoted the current production, and the labor attendance rate has increased from 85% to 100%, setting off a greater upsurge in winter production.

Strengthen the Labor Assessment System

In order to give full play to the strength of the collective organization and the positive role of each individual, continue to inspire the commune members' enthusiasm for labor, and set off a greater upsurge in winter production, while improving labor management, the commune members were mobilized to democratically formulate the following reward and punishment system: First, establish a system of three platforms and one list, that is, each production brigade and production team established an attendance platform, a leap forward platform, and a comparison platform; one list is the honor roll. Second, stipulate attendance assessment standards, and the method is that each production unit establishes an attendance book to record each person's daily lateness and early departure, record absenteeism, record leave, and record labor attitude and quality of work. Third, democratically formulate standards for award recipients. Those with poor labor attitude and violation of labor discipline will be criticized, criticized at meetings, or demoted.

    怎样健全公社的劳动组织
    中共陕西大荔县委农村工作部副部长　潘勤农
    大荔县羌白人民公社第一生产大队在去年12月开始了社会主义和共产主义思想教育运动和整顿人民公社的运动。在这一运动中，工作组结合对社员的思想教育，认真的对劳动组织中存在的混乱现象，进行了整顿，并根据当地实际情况和公社的生产方针，制定了一套新的劳动管理办法和制度。实践证明，这种办法是适合于人民公社这种新型的组织需要的，也是为广大社员普遍欢迎的。现将这个大队的整顿劳动组织的情况介绍如下。
    这个大队划分了十个生产小队。包括十二个自然村，八百八十一户。由于人少地广，每个劳力平均耕地十一亩，每个畜力四十四亩。在以往，当地群众就感到劳力和畜力不足的困难。公社化后，工业生产和农林牧副渔同时开展，各项生产指标和措施都加大了，农村劳力不足的困难更加严重，经常出现活路多没人做的情况。
    调查摸底开展辩论
    解决劳动组织问题，是开展各项生产的关键。为了巩固人民公社，保证各项增产任务的完成，工作组深入各村把农村劳力情况进行了一次彻底的调查摸底。从调查中可以看出，劳力紧张主要是劳力安排不当，组织管理不严，服务性生产占去劳力过多（而且有很多强壮劳力做轻活）等原因造成的。为了统一认识，搞清问题的关键所在，工作组采取了由党内到党外，由领导到群众的办法，把社员提出的问题，分类排队，进行讨论。经过社干部和社员大鸣大放大辩论，统一了思想，提高了认识，找出了办法。大家一致认为，工农业生产必须同时并举，增产任务必须保证完成，解决劳力不足问题除了加强劳动管理以外，必须大搞工具改革运动。
    合理组织劳动力
    根据人民公社社大人多、经营广泛的特点，工作组根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，实行工业和农业并举，自给性生产和商品性生产并举的生产方针，对全队劳力作了统一安排：初步研究确定今年抽出二百零八个劳力（占总劳力的10％）作为长期支援国家工业建设预备力量；抽出一百七十四个劳力（占总劳力的7％）保证公社和大队办工业的需要；下余一千七百二十六个劳动力（占总劳力的83％），由大队合理安排各生产队的劳动力。
    本着统一领导，分级管理，层层负责的精神，和生产队的特点，将劳力合理的进行分工分业，其具体作法是：把经验多、技术高、作务精细的社员，分别组织成定型的粮食、棉花和园艺等三个专业队。这部分劳力占总劳力的34％，它的任务主要是保证各项专业生产任务的完成。其次，建立饲养和集体生活福利等专业组织。并实行了定额管理的办法，节省出大批劳动力。同时，在这些专业组织中，尽可能的作到以女代男，以弱代强，以便使农业生产战线上经常保持较多和较强的产业军，保证农业生产任务的完成。此外，各生产队还组织了突击队。平时在本队与农业产业军并肩作战，共同生产，由生产队统一领导；必要时由生产大队根据突击的需要，统一抽调，组成大兵团作战。
    为了有计划的把突击和经常任务结合起来，生产大队和生产队与突击队及粮、棉、园艺等专业队订好合同，然后统一安排，分段突击，既要保证粮棉专业队的生产任务完成，又要保证突击任务的完成。
    健全生产责任制
    在组织劳动组织的同时，还必须相应的建立与健全生产责任制。工作组协助这个大队初步摸出的办法是：
    第一，生产队和生产大队实行“五包”制度，即包作物播种面积的完成；包增产指标的实现；包投资的合理使用；包增产措施的全面贯彻；包作物计划用工任务的完成。并以五包为内容，生产队和生产大队签定合同，生产队向生产大队完全负责。
    第二，生产队实行专业负责制，即生产队按照向生产大队所包的“五包”任务，在本队分别把社员组织成粮食专业队，棉花专业队，园艺专业队。各个专业队按照
  “五包”要求，分别承包一项或两项作物的生产任务。队与队之间既要有明确的分工负责制，又要有密切配合和互相的支援；既要保证完成所包任务的完成，又要保证整个生产队各项任务的完成。
    第三，生产队的干部实行统一领导、分关把口、密切配合、各负其责的领导负责制。层层分清责任，人人交清任务。
    第四，社员在作务上实行四定责任制，即定任务、定质量、定项目、定时间。在管理上实行四到田的管理责任制，即指标到田、措施到田、责任到田、管理到田。除上述各项责任制以外，队干部还规定了“三抓”“四到田”和“六统一”的管理责任制（三抓是抓思想、抓生产、抓生活；四到田是劳动到田、办公到田、检查到田、评比到田；六统一是统一思想领导、统一计划安排、统一劳动调配、统一劳动竞赛、统一总结交流经验、统一评比奖惩制度）。这些制度经过短期实践，大大的推动了当前生产，劳动出勤率由85％提高到100％，掀起了冬季生产更大高潮。
    加强劳动考核制度
    为了充分发挥集体组织的力量和每个人的积极作用，继续鼓舞社员的劳动热情，掀起更大的冬季生产高潮，在改进劳动管理的同时，发动社员民主制订了以下奖惩制度：第一、建立三台一榜制。即每个生产大队和生产队，均建立了出勤台、跃进台、评比台；一榜是光荣榜。第二、规定出勤考核出勤标准，其办法是各个生产单位均建立考勤簿，来记各个人每日迟到和早退，记旷工、记请假、记劳动态度和做活质量好坏等。第三、民主制订受奖者标准。对劳动态度不好、违犯劳动纪律的，分别给予批评、会议批判或记过降级。
