The Struggle of the Mexican People
	Zhang Ye
	Mexico broke away from Spanish rule and gained independence as early as one hundred and thirty-eight years ago, and later carried out a bourgeois democratic revolution, and the national economy developed. However, the most aggressive US imperialism has tried its best to undermine Mexico's independent development, carrying out all kinds of control and economic plunder. The economic crisis in the United States is also impacting the Mexican economy, causing it to encounter increasingly serious difficulties. In order to get rid of this predicament, the Mexican people are continuing their struggle against US imperialist control and plunder.
	The Bourgeois Democratic Revolution
	The bourgeois democratic revolution that broke out in Mexico in 1910 ended the dictatorship of Diaz, who represented the interests of the landlord class and the comprador class and served US imperialism. The Constitution was formulated in 1917, which has the following important provisions on the land issue: 1. The state is the fundamental owner of land, rivers, and minerals; 2. The state has the right to restrict or confiscate private property; 3. Only Mexicans can own land, rivers, and mines; 4. The church shall not own, operate, or lease real estate; 5. Joint-stock companies shall not own land; 6. Take appropriate measures to break up large estates, develop small land ownership, establish new rural population centers, and generally encourage and protect agriculture. Regarding the protection of labor, it stipulates: 1. Complete recognition of the right to organize trade unions; 2. Establishing an eight-hour working day, a six-day working week, and a seven-hour working day for night work; 3. Stipulating a minimum wage and double wages for overtime; 4. Stipulating rest time for female and child laborers and other protections for them; etc. Many of these provisions also apply to agricultural workers. In addition, the constitution also stipulates the separation of church and state, the right of the people to organize political groups and conduct democratic activities, expand educational facilities, and improve people's health.
	This constitution reflected the aspirations of the Mexican people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle at that time. Before 1910, Mexico suffered from the cruel exploitation of feudal landlords internally and the barbaric plunder of imperialism (mainly US imperialism) externally. The situation at that time was: three thousand families occupied almost half of Mexico's land, the Catholic Church was like an independent kingdom, and US investment surged to more than one billion US dollars. Most of the mines, iron refineries, oil fields, railways and other important economic sectors were controlled by US and British imperialists. This made Mexico, which has abundant resources, one of the poorest and most oppressed countries in the world, seriously hindering Mexico's development. The Mexican bourgeois democratic revolution and the 1917 Constitution, which reflected the achievements of the revolution, weakened large landlord ownership, restricted the privileges of the church, obtained many economic concessions for workers from capitalists, and dealt a blow to the control and plunder of US imperialism.
	The Progressive Measures of the Cardenas Government
	After the Mexican Revolution, several presidents, including Carranza, Obregon, Calles, and Rodriguez, did not actively implement the progressive clauses stipulated in the Constitution. It was not until the progressive leader of the Revolutionary Organization Party, Cardenas, took office from 1934 to 1940 that he began to implement the nationalization policy stipulated in the Constitution and distribute a large amount of land to farmers under the high tide of the Mexican people's movement.
	In 1937, the Cardenas government nationalized the national railway network mainly belonging to British and American capital; in 1938, it nationalized the oil fields belonging to American, British, and Dutch capital. At the same time, a more extensive land reform was implemented, distributing more than 18 million hectares of land to farmers, which is more than twice the total amount distributed since the beginning of the revolution, and a National Agricultural Credit Bank was established to help farmers.
	In addition, the Cardenas government revised and strengthened the national labor law, giving workers some rights to manage enterprises. He allowed women to participate in grassroots elections and made significant contributions to Mexican education.
	The measures taken by the Cardenas government were welcomed and supported by the Mexican people, but angered US and British imperialism. After the nationalization of Mexican oil, the United States and Britain refused to recognize the Mexican Petroleum Company, openly threatened the Cardenas government, and reduced the amount of silver that the United States routinely purchased from Mexico, attempting to strangle Mexico economically. Britain even severed diplomatic relations with Mexico as a result.
	After President Cardenas' term expired in 1940, Camacho and Alleman successively served as presidents. The Alleman government undermined the rights won by workers and peasants from long-term revolutionary struggles, stopped land reform measures, and relied on American loans to "develop industry," allowing American monopoly capital to take the opportunity to infiltrate. Since Cortines took office in 1952, he has restored land reform measures, levied land from large landlords and distributed it to farmers, and in November 1958, based on a Mexican land distribution law prohibiting the possession of large tracts of land (large estates), he confiscated 774,956 hectares of land occupied by the American Palomas Land and Livestock Company, incorporating it into the country's territory, and made some achievements in encouraging the development of industry and agriculture. However, in these years, American capital has continued to infiltrate Mexico.
	In terms of foreign policy, Mexico refused to sign a bilateral military agreement with the United States, abstained from the anti-communist declaration proposed by the United States at the Tenth Pan-American Conference in 1954, and opposed the merger of the Organization of American States with the aggressive North Atlantic Group. Despite pressure from the US State Department, Mexico has maintained its own position on many issues. For example, Mexico abstained from voting when the 13th UN General Assembly voted on the proposal not to include the issue of Chinese representation on the agenda. During the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly in September of the same year to discuss the Arab ten-nation proposal on the withdrawal of the United States and Britain from Lebanon and Jordan, Mexico proposed an amendment to prevent the wording of the Arab proposal from being misinterpreted as legalizing the US-British occupation of Lebanon and Jordan. President Mateos, who took office on December 1, 1958, announced when he was sworn in that his government would uphold Mexico's advocacy of mutual understanding, cooperation, peace, justice, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual respect among nations in international relations.
	The Development of the National Economy
	The nationalization and land reform policies implemented by the Mexican government, especially during the Cardenas era, promoted the development of the national economy.
	Due to the implementation of oil nationalization, the growth of Mexico's national oil industry has been quite rapid. Currently, Mexico's oil industry ranks sixth in the capitalist world and second in Latin American countries, second only to Venezuela. In recent years, the average annual growth rate of oil production has been 11%. Crude oil has increased from 79.9 million barrels in 1952 to 91.4 million barrels in 1957, and the total amount of refining has increased from 64.9 million barrels to 87 million barrels, supplying 92% of the energy consumed domestically. The development of the oil industry has promoted the development of other industrial sectors. In the past ten years, steel production has more than doubled, with an average annual output of 300,000 tons in 1947-1949, which increased to 1,049,000 tons in 1957, ranking second in Latin American countries after Brazil. In the past five years, the total value of Mexico's industrial production has increased by 40.2%, with an average annual growth of 8%.
	The Mexican government's investment has promoted economic development. The government owns enterprises such as the Mexican Petroleum Company, the Mexican National Railway, the Mexican Iron and Steel Plant, the Federal Electricity Company, the National Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, and many other such enterprises.
	The result of implementing land reform has also promoted the development of agriculture. Thirty years ago, Mexico had to import most agricultural products from abroad, but now the country's grain production can already meet 95% of the demand. In the past five years, the total value of Mexico's agricultural production has increased by 30.8%, with an average annual growth of 6.1%. However, despite the implementation of land reform, there are still more than 2 million rural households without land, and 15 million farmers have very little land, and the lives of farmers are still extremely poor.
	The Plunder of US Capital
	The control and plunder of the Mexican economy by US monopoly capital has not been curbed. According to materials announced by William McDonald, chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce, the total amount of US investment in Mexico has reached 787 million US dollars. In addition to obtaining astonishingly high profits, the penetration of foreign capital has also controlled some of Mexico's main economic sectors. For example, three American companies control 50% of gold, 61% of silver, 90% of lead, 80% of copper, and 97% of zinc production. American capital also controls 68% of electricity and nearly 80% of foreign trade. In addition, the United States also uses loans with political and economic conditions to control and plunder Mexico, obstruct the development of its national industry, and try its best to turn Mexico into a raw material production base, a source of cheap labor, and a sales market for industrial products for the United States.
	The US economic crisis has seriously affected the Mexican economy. Mexico's foreign trade mainly relies on the United States, with about 80% of imports coming from the United States and 75% of exports going to the United States. Due to the further adoption of unequal trade policies such as "buying cheap and selling expensive," raising tariffs, reducing and restricting imports, and dumping "surplus" cotton by US monopoly capital, Mexico's foreign trade has experienced a huge deficit for the first time in recent years, reaching 550 million US dollars in 1957 and 260 million US dollars in the first five months of 1958. The United States' suppression of lead and zinc prices has already caused 75% of Mexico's small factories and mines to close down. The United States announced in September 1958 that it would implement import quotas on lead and zinc, which will reduce Mexico's national income by 40% and cause a large number of miners to become unemployed.
	At present, due to the intensified penetration and plunder of the Mexican economy by US monopoly capital, the Mexican economy is in difficulty and faces a serious crisis of foreign trade deficits, increased budget deficits, reduced gold and foreign exchange reserves, inflation, and rising prices. This situation seriously damages the interests of the working class, farmers, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie, thus making the contradictions between the Mexican people and US imperialism and its Mexican agents increasingly acute. The Mexican Communist Party and the Mexican people regard getting rid of the control and plunder of foreign monopoly capital, mainly US monopoly capital, as the basic task of their struggle. In this struggle, all patriotic and democratic forces in Mexico have become increasingly united. The situation in which the East Wind prevails over the West Wind and the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising day by day is beneficial to the struggle of the Mexican people.

    墨西哥人民的斗争
    章叶
    墨西哥早在一百三十八年以前就摆脱了西班牙的统治而获得独立，后来又进行了资产阶级民主革命，民族经济有了发展。但是，最富侵略性的美帝国主义竭力破坏墨西哥的独立发展，进行种种控制和经济掠夺。美国的经济危机也冲击着墨西哥的经济，使它遇到越来越严重的困难。墨西哥人民为了摆脱这种处境，继续进行着反对美帝国主义的控制和掠夺的斗争。
    资产阶级民主革命
    1910年墨西哥爆发的资产阶级民主革命，结束了代表地主阶级和买办阶级利益并为美帝国主义服务的迪亚斯独裁政权。1917年制定了宪法，这部宪法对于土地问题有下列重要的规定：一、国家是土地、河流、矿藏的根本所有者；二、国家有权限制或没收私有财产；三、只有墨西哥人能领有土地、河流和矿山；四、教会不得领有、经营或承典不动产；五、股份公司不得领有土地；六、采取适当的方法拆散大地产，发展小土地所有制，建立新的农村人口的中心，并在总的方面鼓励与保护农业。关于保护劳工方面规定：一、完全承认组织工会的权利；二、确定八小时工作制，一周六日工作制以及夜工七小时工作制；三、规定最低限度工资以及加班付加倍的工资；四、规定女工与童工的休息时间以及对他们的其他保护；等等。这些规定有许多也适用于农业工人。此外，宪法还规定了教会与国家分离，人民有组织政治团体与进行民主活动的权利，扩大教育设施和增进人民健康等项改革。
    这部宪法是反映了当时墨西哥人民反帝反封建斗争的愿望。在1910年以前，墨西哥内有封建地主残酷剥削，外有帝国主义（主要是美帝国主义）的蛮横掠夺。当时的情况是：三千个家族几乎占有了墨西哥的一半土地，天主教会俨然自成独立王国，美国的投资激增到十亿美元以上，大部分矿山、炼铁厂、油田、铁路及其他重要经济部门都掌握在美、英帝国主义者手中。这就使拥有丰富资源的墨西哥，成了世界上最贫困和最受压迫的国家之一，严重地阻碍了墨西哥的发展。墨西哥的资产阶级民主革命和反映革命成果的1917年宪法，削弱了大地主所有制，限制了教会的特权，为工人从资本家那里取得了许多经济上的让步，并给了美帝国主义的控制和掠夺以打击。
    卡德纳斯政府的进步措施
    墨西哥革命后，卡兰萨、奥布勒冈、卡勒斯、罗德利格斯等几任总统，都没有积极实现宪法中规定的进步条款。一直到1934—1940年革命组织党进步领袖卡德纳斯执政期间才在墨西哥人民运动高涨的情况下，开始推行宪法中规定的国有化政策，并把大量土地分配给农民。
    卡德纳斯政府在1937年把主要属于美英资本的全国性铁路网收归国有；1938年把属于美国和英荷资本的油田收归国有。同时还实行了较广泛的土地改革，把一千八百多万公顷的土地分配给农民，等于革命开始以来分配总数的两倍以上，并设立了国家农贷银行来帮助农民。
    此外，卡德纳斯政府修订和加强了全国劳工法，给工人以一些管理企业的权利。他允许妇女参加基层选举的投票，并对墨西哥教育事业也作了重大贡献。
    卡德纳斯政府所采取的这些措施，受到了墨西哥人民的欢迎和拥护，但触怒了美英等帝国主义。美英两国在墨西哥石油国有化后拒绝承认墨西哥石油公司，公开威胁卡德纳斯政府，并且削减美国照例向墨西哥购买的白银数量，妄图从经济上扼杀墨西哥，英国还因而与墨西哥断绝了外交关系。
    1940年卡德纳斯总统任期届满后，卡马楚和艾勒曼先后相继出任总统。艾勒曼政府破坏了工人和农民从长期革命斗争中争取到的权利，停止了土地改革措施，并且依靠美国贷款来“发展工业”，使美国垄断资本乘机渗入。1952年科丁奈斯执政以来，恢复了土地改革措施，征收大地主的土地分配给农民，并在1958年11月间又根据一项关于禁止拥有大块土地（大庄园）的墨西哥土地分配法，把美国帕洛马斯土地畜牧公司所占有的七十七万四千九百五十六公顷的土地没收，并入国家的领土，在鼓励工农业的发展上取得了一些成绩。但是，这些年内，美国资本仍然继续不断地渗入墨西哥。
    在对外政策方面，墨西哥拒绝同美国签订双边军事协定，在1954年第十届泛美会议上对美国提出的反共宣言投弃权票，反对美洲国家组织同侵略性的北大西洋集团合并。尽管美国国务院施加压力，墨西哥在很多问题上持有自己的立场，如1958年第十三届联合国大会表决不把中国代表权问题列入议程的提案时墨西哥投弃权票，在同年9月联合国大会紧急特别会议讨论美英从黎巴嫩、约旦撤军的阿拉伯十国提案时，墨西哥曾提出一个修正案，要使阿拉伯提案的辞句不致被误认为美英侵占黎、约是合法的。1958年12月1日就任的马特奥斯总统在他宣誓就职时宣布，他的政府将维护墨西哥在国际关系方面争取互相谅解、合作、和平、正义、不干涉内政和各民族之间互相尊重的主张。
    民族经济的发展
    墨西哥政府，特别是在卡德纳斯执政时期，实行的国有化和土地改革政策，促进了民族经济的发展。
    由于实行石油国有化，墨西哥民族石油工业的增长相当快。目前，墨西哥石油工业的产量为资本主义世界中的第六位，为拉丁美洲国家中的第二位，仅次于委内瑞拉。最近几年石油产量每年平均增长速度为11％，原油从1952年的七千九百九十万桶增加到1957年的九千一百四十万桶，提炼总额从六千四百九十万桶增加到八千七百万桶，供给了国内所消耗的能量的92％。石油工业的发展促进了其他工业部门的发展。最近十年间，钢的生产增加了两倍多，1947—1949年每年平均产量为三十万吨，而1957年就增加到一百零四万九千吨，在拉丁美洲国家中仅次于巴西而居第二位。在最近五年期间，墨西哥工业生产总值增加40.2％，每年平均增长8％。
    墨西哥政府的投资，推动了经济的发展。政府拥有像墨西哥石油公司、墨西哥国营铁路、墨西哥炼铁厂、联邦电力公司、国营车辆制造厂以及其他许多这一类的企业。
    实行土地改革的结果，也促进了农业的发展。在三十年前，墨西哥要从国外购进大部分农产品，而目前本国生产的粮食已经可以满足95％的需求了。在最近五年期间，墨西哥的农业生产总值上升30.8％，每年平均增长6.1％。但是尽管实行了土地改革，农村中还有二百多万农户没有土地，一千五百万农民仅有很少的土地，农民的生活仍然极其贫困。
    美国资本的掠夺
    美国垄断资本对墨西哥经济的控制和掠夺，仍未受到遏止。据美国商会会长威廉·麦克唐纳宣布的材料，美国在墨西哥的投资总额，已经达到了七亿八千七百万美元。外国资本的渗入，除了获取惊人的高额利润以外，并控制了墨西哥的一些主要经济部门。如三家美国公司控制了50％的金、61％的银、90％的铅、80％的铜、97％的锌的生产，美国资本还控制了68％的电力和将近80％的对外贸易。此外，美国还通过附有政治、经济条件的贷款来控制和掠夺墨西哥，阻挠它的民族工业发展，竭力要把墨西哥变成美国的原料产地、廉价劳动力的来源和工业品销售市场。
    美国的经济危机严重地影响墨西哥的经济。墨西哥的对外贸易主要依靠美国，约80％的进口来自美国，75％的出口输往美国。由于美国垄断资本进一步采取“贱买贵卖”、提高关税、减少和限制进口、倾销“剩余”棉花等不平等贸易政策，使墨西哥的对外贸易在最近几年来首次出现了巨大的逆差，1957年达五亿五千万美元，1958年头五个月达两亿六千万美元。美国压低铅、锌价格，已经使墨西哥75％的小厂矿倒闭了。美国在1958年9月宣布，要实行对铅、锌的进口限额，这将使墨西哥的国民收入减少40％，并将引起大批矿工失业。
    目前，由于美国垄断资本的加紧对墨西哥经济渗入和掠夺，使墨西哥的经济陷于困难，面临严重的对外贸易逆差、预算赤字增加、黄金外汇储备减少、通货膨胀和物价上涨的危机。这种情况严重地损害了工人阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的利益，从而使墨西哥人民同美帝国主义及其墨西哥代理人之间的矛盾越来越尖锐。墨西哥共产党和墨西哥人民把摆脱外国垄断资本，主要是美国垄断资本的控制和掠夺作为自己斗争的基本任务。在这一斗争中，墨西哥一切爱国民主力量已日益团结起来。东风压倒西风和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族独立运动的日益高涨的形势，对墨西哥人民的斗争是有利的。
