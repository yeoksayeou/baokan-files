    A Month Between
    —Visiting the Communist Labor Team of the Stalin Collective Farm
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng

    Full Moon
    This winter in the Moscow region is colder than usual. In late December, the mercury in the thermometer dropped straight down: minus twelve degrees, twenty degrees, thirty-three degrees... forests, houses, mounds, and deep valleys were all dressed in silver, and thick snow sealed all the roads tightly.
    It was a sunny day, with not a cloud in the sky. Our car sped along the icy highway. The road was slippery and the car was fast. In less than an hour, the car left the highway and turned onto a snowy fork. At this time, through the car window, we could see the smoke curling up from the Stalin Collective Farm in the Noginsk district.
    When agronomist Kazlova of the collective farm learned of our purpose, she excitedly said, as if she had some good news to share, "You've come at just the right time. Today, our Communist Labor Team is exactly one month old from its birth." This agronomist is also an active organizer of the farm's Communist Labor Team.
    On November 28th, when the news that the Moscow marshalling station of the Moscow-Ryazan Railway had organized the first Communist Labor Team reached the Stalin Collective Farm, the farm was holding an open Party congress to discuss the draft of the Seven-Year Plan. The news woke up the villagers like a thunderclap in spring. At the discussion, those excellent milkmaids and tractor drivers eagerly stood up, vying to say: "Can't we do this too?" "We can definitely do it even better." After a heated discussion, the Stalin Collective Farm took the lead in the entire state and formed two Communist Labor Teams: a field work team and a dairy farm team.
    The dairy farm's Communist Labor Team has thirty-nine members, including twenty-four milkmaids and fifteen feeders. They manage a total of three cowsheds, two hundred and twenty-eight cows, and some calves and bulls. When discussing how to work in the spirit of communism, the team first proposed a guarantee that every cow would increase its milk production, striving to reach 4,200 kilograms of milk per cow in 1958.
    "We have already completed this plan ahead of schedule." Kazlova paused, as if she wanted to carefully consider every word she said, "In winter, cows rest when they give birth to calves, and milk production is low. Our team members worked diligently, feeding them in a timely manner and maintaining good hygiene, with the result that we increased the average daily milk production per cow from five and a half liters to seven liters. Don't think that one and a half liters is a small amount; it was hard-earned. What's important is that we broke the conventional wisdom that production always decreases in winter. We did not let milk production decrease, but increased it. This is the result of laboring in the spirit of communism, and it is also the result of the increased ideological awareness of the team members."

    New Home
    Kazlova led us along a small path in the fields. The snow on the ground would sometimes fly up and sometimes fall down with gusts of wind.
    In front of us appeared two rows of neat cowsheds, with thick snow covering the roofs, emitting puffs of steam, and strings of icicles hanging around the eaves. All of this told us that the diligent owners had made the cowsheds very warm. In the middle of the two rows of cowsheds was a square open space, with piles of greenish-yellow fodder grass everywhere.
    In the cowshed that the team members call the "New Home," I met Nikishina, the captain of the Communist Labor Team. She is in her forties, a strong and straightforward person. She and Kazlova organized this "New Home" together, and because of her conscientious work and care for her comrades, the team members all liked her.
    In the narrow cowshed, rows of white-spotted cows stood on both sides. As usual, in winter, the skylights facing the sun were covered by ice and snow, and the lights in the aisle in the middle of the cowshed were always on. The cows shone brightly under the lights, as if they had just been washed and not yet dried. Both the troughs and the aisles were cleaned particularly cleanly, without piles of urine and manure. An old man in his fifties—an activist in the team—walked non-stop from east to west, removing manure. Each cow had a pile of feed next to its head. Such a clean and orderly cowshed was truly rare. Only then did I understand the meaning of the team members calling it the "New Home": in the past, the villagers only made their own small families clean, warm, and beautiful. Today, the team members are concerned with making this "New Home" even cleaner, warmer, and more beautiful.
    Work team leader Nikishina said: "Although it was a work team before, everyone did their own thing and thought their own thoughts. Xu Duo's cows produced four or five thousand kilograms of milk, while others produced three thousand or two thousand kilograms. Why did such differences appear in the same cowshed? It was previously thought that the breeds of cows were different, but now it is said that the management methods were different. After the establishment of the Communist Labor Team, everyone's ideological awareness improved, and you helped me and I helped you, learning from each other. Cows with low yields in the past gradually increased their production."
    Now, the members of this "New Home," which is full of friendship, mutual assistance, and warmth, are working together to study how to shorten the resting period for cows after conception, in order to increase milk production. Some experiments have been successful. According to calculations, this method can extend the lactation period by about half a month, which means that each cow can produce an average of about one hundred and fifty kilograms more milk per year.

    Past Events
    In the office of Farm Chairman Sheskilov, he enthusiastically recounted a past event to the reporter.
    Everyone in the Stalin Collective Farm, young and old, men and women, knows that the Communist Labor Team of the dairy farm created a miracle: it solved a family dispute that no one had thought could be solved before. Feeder Pansikov and milkmaid Kufrjanova are the parents of four children. They are both members of the dairy farm's work team. Both of them are very capable, but they don't have a good family life and often quarrel. Pansikov also likes to drink, and he quarrels even more when he comes home after drinking too much. As a result, the couple cannot work properly and concentrate on their work, which greatly affects production.
    When this couple quarreled the most fiercely, they went to the farm chairman and the team leader every two or three days to complain about their grievances. People repeatedly tried to persuade them, but it was ineffective. Not long before the dairy farm established the Communist Labor Team, both of them filed for divorce.
    The regulations of the dairy farm's Communist Labor Team explicitly stipulate that each member must consciously live in the spirit of communism, which means that each member is required to live according to the highest communist moral standards. So, can Pansikov and his wife be accepted into the team? And what to do if they are not admitted? While the team members were discussing this matter, a fierce struggle also unfolded in the couple's minds.
    At the first team members' meeting, the old milkmaids eagerly said that their quarrelsome situation did not qualify them to join the team. Some people said that they had forgotten that life was getting better every day and that everyone was working hard to build communism, but they were still messing around. The team members severely criticized them one after another. Afterwards, the Party members of the work team conducted individual education.
    One day not long ago, Pansikov rushed into the farm chairman's office excitedly and said to the chairman, "It's all my fault, and I've caused you and everyone a lot of trouble. Now the work team has taught me well, and I will definitely work hard with everyone and learn to live well like everyone else...." Talking about this, the farm chairman said with a smile that the fresh wind of communism had awakened his mind.
    Now, Pansikov and his wife are living very closely together, and they are also very enthusiastic about production. Pansikov not only does his own work well, but also often takes time to help his wife with her work. He is determined to help his wife become an advanced producer in the Communist Labor Team.
    The news that the dairy farm's Communist Labor Team had helped Pansikov's family reconcile quickly spread throughout the entire farm. Some old-fashioned and curious villagers inquired everywhere about the team members, asking what method they used to "glue together this broken plate." The team members replied that it was communist ideological education. Communist ideological awareness is a universal key, and with it, any lock can be opened.

    Source
    The source of the formation and achievements of the Stalin Collective Farm's Communist Labor Team is the leadership of the Party. The dairy farm's work team has four Communist Party members, who played a significant leading role in organizing the work team. Each member's ideological awareness is different. Therefore, the entire process of organizing the work team is also a process of the Party conducting communist ideological education for the masses. As Kazlova told me, when they first started discussing the establishment of the Communist Labor Team, some elderly feeders said, "This is not my business." When the vast majority of team members were working happily and diligently, they were still doing everything as before. So the work team sent Communist Youth League members to help them move feed grass. The young people used their brains and came up with new ways to save time and feed the cows fully. Seeing the young people's enthusiasm, coupled with the repeated education of the Party members, their thinking gradually changed, and now they are working as vigorously as the young people.
    When talking about leading the work team, the farm chairman said, "The task of Party members is to do ideological work on people, which is both important and truly complex. To be honest, the abilities of our farm's Party members are also limited, so we have adopted the method of organizing the masses to carry out self-education together."
    The dairy farm's Communist Labor Team also stipulated a work and study system, such as stipulating that a general meeting of all team members should be held every ten days to conduct mutual criticism and praise. There are also political current affairs studies on weekdays; agronomic technical classes three times a month. In the past, it was considered good if half of the team members attended such courses, but now no one is absent and no one is late, and there are more questions asked in class than before. Every team member consciously studies, so the results have been very significant in the past month. No wonder people say: "The Communist Labor Team is like a main shaft. When it rotates, it drives everything else forward together."
    Now, the Stalin Collective Farm's Communist Labor Team is enthusiastically discussing the production tasks for the first year of the Seven-Year Plan in 1959. They have decided to make the average annual yield per cow 4,500 kilograms in 1959, ensure that there are no accidents, raise the calves well, and strive to increase the number of cows in the entire team to 279 within one year.

    一月之间
    ——访斯大林农庄共产主义劳动工作队
    本报记者　戴枫
    满月
    今年莫斯科州的冬天比往年更冷。12月下旬，寒暑表的水银柱直线地往下落：零下十二度、二十度、三十三度……，森林、房屋、土岗、深谷全部都换上了银装，厚厚的积雪把所有的道路严实地封闭起来。
    这是一个阳光普照的日子，万里无云。我们的汽车在结冰的公路上疾驰，路滑车快，不到一小时，汽车离开公路转上了积雪一片的叉道。这时，隔着车窗可以望见炊烟缕缕的诺金区斯大林集体农庄了。
    集体农庄农艺师卡兹洛娃知道我们的来意后，就像有什么喜讯相告似的激动地说：“你们来得真凑巧，从诞生日算起，今天我们的共产主义劳动工作队正满一个月。”这位农艺师也正是农庄共产主义劳动工作队的积极组织者。
    11月28日，莫斯科—梁赞铁路莫斯科调车站组织第一个共产主义劳动工作队的消息传到斯大林农庄的时候，农庄正举行党的公开大会，讨论七年计划提纲。这个消息像春雷似的惊醒了庄员们。讨论会上那些优秀的挤奶员、拖拉机手一个个兴奋地起来抢着说：“难道我们不能这样干吗？”、“我们定能干得更漂亮。”经过热烈的讨论之后，斯大林农庄在全州领先组成了两个共产主义劳动工作队：田间工作队和奶牛场工作队。
    奶牛场的共产主义劳动工作队有三十九个队员，包括二十四个挤奶员、十五个饲养员。总共管三个牛栏，二百二十八头奶牛和一部分牛犊子、公牛。工作队在讨论如何按共产主义精神工作时，首先提出保证，条条奶牛都要增产，争取1958年每条奶牛产量达到四千二百公斤。
    “这个计划我们已经提前完成了。”卡兹洛娃停了一下，仿佛要把想说的话逐字逐句都要琢磨一番似的，“冬天，奶牛生犊子要休息，产奶少。我们队员个个认真干，适时喂料，搞好清洁卫生，结果，我们使每条奶牛每天的平均产奶量由早先的五公升半提高到了七公升。你们不要认为这一公升半少啊，它的得来可不易。要知道，重要的是打破了先前认为冬天总要减产的常规。我们不让牛奶减产，而提高了产量。这是用共产主义精神劳动的结果，也是队员思想觉悟提高的结果。”
    新家
    卡兹洛娃领着我们在田间小径上走着。地面上的积雪随着阵阵狂风，忽而飞起，忽而又落下。
    我们面前出现了两排整齐的牛栏，铺着厚雪的房顶冒出一团团蒸气，屋檐四周挂着一串串冰凌，这都告诉我们：勤劳的主人把牛栏烧得非常温暖。两排牛舍中间是方形平地，到处堆着青里透黄的饲料草。
    在队员们称之为“新家”的牛栏里，我会见了共产主义劳动工作队队长尼基西娜。她四十多岁了，是个坚强直率的人。她同卡兹洛娃一道组织起了这个“新家”，由于工作认真，关心同志，所以队员们都喜欢她。
    狭长的牛栏里，两边排立着一列花白奶牛。跟往常一样，冬天冰雪遮住了向阳的天窗子，牛栏中间通道上的电灯总是开着的。奶牛在灯光下闪闪发亮，好像刚刚洗过澡还没有干透似的。不论是牛槽、甬道，都打扫得特别干净，没有一堆尿粪。一个五十来岁的老头——队里的积极分子，不停地从东头走到西头，铲除粪尿。每条奶牛头边都堆着饲料。这样清洁有条有理的牛栏，真是难得。从这里我才懂得了队员们把它称为“新家”的含义：庄员们过去只把个人的小家庭弄得干净、温暖、漂亮，今天，队员们关心的是把这个“新家”弄得更干净、温暖、漂亮了。
    工作队长尼基西娜说：“从前虽然也是一个工作队，可是大家各干各的，各想各的。雪杜娃管的奶牛出奶四、五千公斤，别人呢，三千两千公斤的都有。为什么在一个牛栏里出现这样的差别呢？早先认为牛种不同，现在才说是管理方法不一了。成立共产主义劳动工作队后，大家思想觉悟有了提高，你帮我，我帮你，互相学习。过去低产的奶牛渐渐增产了。”
    现在，这个充满友爱互助温暖的“新家”成员们，正在同心合力地研究使奶牛缩短受孕休息期，以便提高产奶量。有的试验已成功，据计算，这方法可以使产奶期延长半个月左右，即每条奶牛每年平均能增产一百五十公斤左右的奶。
    往事
    在农庄主席雪斯基洛夫的办公室里，他兴致勃勃地向记者叙述了一段往事。
    斯大林农庄的男女老少都知道奶牛场的共产主义劳动工作队创造了个奇迹：解决了早先谁都认为无法解决的家庭纠葛。饲养员潘西柯夫和挤奶员库甫里雅诺娃是四个孩子的父母亲。他俩都是奶牛场工作队队员，俩口子都很能干，就是过不好家庭生活，常吵嘴。潘西柯夫又爱喝酒，喝多了回家就更要吵嘴。这样，夫妻二人不能好好安心工作，大大影响生产。
    这对夫妻争吵得最厉害的时候，三天两头找农庄主席、找队长，各自申诉苦衷，人们再三相劝都无效。奶牛场成立共产主义劳动工作队前不久，他们双方提出要求离婚。
    奶牛场共产主义劳动工作队规章明文规定，每个队员要自觉地按共产主义精神来生活，也就是说，要求每个队员以最高的共产主义道德标准来生活。这样，能否接受潘西柯夫夫妇入队呢？不入队又怎么办呢？队员们正在讨论这件事的时候，这对夫妻思想上也展开了激烈的斗争。
    在第一次队员集会上，老挤奶员们争先说，他们这种吵吵闹闹的情况，不够资格入队。有人说，他们忘了，生活在天天好起来，人人都在为建设共产主义努力奋斗，他们却还胡闹。队员们你一言我一语严厉批评了一通。之后，工作队的党员又进行了个别教育。
    不久前的一天，潘西柯夫兴冲冲的闯进农庄主席的办公室，向主席说，“都是我的不是，给你、给大家增添了许多不安。现在工作队教好了我，我一定同大家一起努力干，学大家一样来好好生活……。”谈到这里，农庄主席笑着说，清新的共产主义之风吹醒了他的头脑。
    现在，潘西柯夫夫妇过得很亲密，生产劲头也很大。潘西柯夫不但做好自己的工作，还经常抽时间帮助妻子工作。他决心要帮助自己的妻子成为共产主义劳动工作队的先进生产者。
    奶牛场共产主义劳动工作队帮助潘西柯夫家庭和好的消息飞快地传遍了全农庄。有些老脑筋的、好奇的庄员到处打听队员，用什么方法“胶补起这个碎盘子的”。队员们回答说，是共产主义思想教育。共产主义思想觉悟是万能的钥匙，有了它，什么锁都能打得开。
    泉源
    斯大林农庄共产主义劳动工作队的组成与取得成绩的泉源是党的领导。奶牛场工作队有四个共产党员，他们在组织工作队中起了显著的领导带头作用。每个队员的思想觉悟是不一样的，因此，组织工作队的整个过程也就是党对群众进行共产主义思想教育的过程。如卡兹洛娃告诉我的，刚开始讨论成立共产主义劳动工作队时，有些年老的饲养员说，“这不是我的事。”当绝大多数队员兴高采烈地努力工作时，他们还是一切照老样。于是工作队派共青团员帮助他们搬料草。青年们开动脑筋，想出了节省时间，又让奶牛吃得饱饱的新办法。老人见青年人干劲十足，加上党员的一再教育，思想也逐渐变了，现在他们已跟青年人干得一样带劲。
    农庄主席在谈到对工作队的领导时说，
  “党员的任务就是做人的思想工作，这项工作既重要也真复杂。说真的，我们农庄党员能力也有限，所以我们采取组织群众一起来进行自我教育的办法”。
    奶牛场共产主义劳动工作队还规定了工作和学习制度，如规定每十天开一次全体队员大会，相互进行批评表扬。平时还有政治时事学习；每月三次农艺技术课。早先上这种课程时，到半数队员已算好的了，现在没有人缺席，没有迟到的，课堂上提问比以前多得多了。每个队员都自觉地学习，因此，一个月来成绩非常显著。怪不得人们都这样说：“共产主义劳动工作队好比一个主轴，它一转动，把其他的都一起带动前进了。”
    现在，斯大林农庄共产主义劳动工作队正热烈地讨论着1959年七年计划第一年的生产任务。他们决定在1959年使每条奶牛的平均年产量为四千五百公斤，保证不出事故，喂养好牛犊子，争取一年内全队奶牛增加到二百七十九条。（附图片）
