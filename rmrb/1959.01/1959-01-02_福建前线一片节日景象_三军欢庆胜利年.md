Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, January 1st: Our front-line reporter reports: The Fujian front is filled with festive scenes today. The three armed forces are joyfully celebrating the New Year to welcome even greater victories this year.

　　Yesterday and today, apart from the festive laughter, there was no artillery fire on the front-line positions. A day or two ago, our front-line broadcasting station informed the Chiang troops through broadcasts that, in order to allow them and the island's residents to spend the New Year in peace, our army would not fire on the 31st and 1st (single days).

　　While still vigilantly monitoring enemy harassment activities to ensure the people of the motherland spend the festival peacefully, the soldiers made their positions exceptionally beautiful, with gongs and drums resounding and cheers roaring. Some units even used pebbles and shells to create many slogans and patterns of Tiananmen Square, Longevity Hill, and other landmarks. Soldiers' poems were also created with stones on the positions. One of the poems read: "Soldiers with hearts of utter devotion, yearn for Tiananmen Square in Beijing, remember our beloved Chairman Mao, a thousand words are hard to express, after much thought, one plan emerges, vow to build military merits to welcome the New Spring."

　　Today, before the morning stars had fallen and as a red glow appeared in the east, the soldiers greeted the first morning of the year with joyful firecrackers and drums. Squads and platoons exchanged New Year's greetings and wished each other victory. Then, beating gongs and drums and carrying New Year's cards and letters of appreciation, they went to the neighboring positions and nearby villages to offer New Year's greetings to the fraternal units fighting side-by-side, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and the members of the people's communes.

　　At the artillery positions, after the sun rose, the sounds of accordions, erhus, and sanxians filled the air, and the radio was surrounded by gunners. At a certain naval wharf, as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, hundreds of sailors and returned overseas Chinese students held hands and danced in a circle amidst songs and firecrackers. The pilots of an air force unit posted their red paper resolutions on the airport bulletin board early this morning, determined to give invading enemy planes a head-on blow.

### 福建前线一片节日景象  三军欢庆胜利年

    福建前线一片节日景象
    三军欢庆胜利年
    新华社福建前线1日电　本社前线记者报道：福建前线今天到处呈现着节日的景象，三军将士为迎接今年更大的胜利，纵情欢度新年。
    昨天和今天，前沿阵地上，除了节日的欢笑之外，没有炮声。我军前沿对敌广播站一两天以前，就通过广播告诉了蒋军，为了让他们和岛上居民安静地过年，31日和1日这两个单日我军不打炮。
    战士们除了依然警惕地监视敌人骚扰活动，确保祖国人民安度佳节以外，阵地上锣鼓喧天，欢声雷动，每个地方都打扮得格外美丽，有的部队还用石子和贝壳等砌了许多标语和天安门、万寿山等图案。战士的诗也用石子砌在阵地上。其中有一首诗写道：“战士一片赤诚心，向往北京天安门，思念敬爱毛主席，千言万语难表心，左思右想一条计，誓建战功迎新春。”
    今天，晨星未落，东方出现一抹红霞的时候，战士们就以欢乐的爆竹声和锣鼓声，迎接了今年的第一个早晨。班与班、排与排，互相拜年，互祝胜利。接着，他们敲打着锣鼓，带着贺年片和慰问信，到友邻阵地和附近的村庄里，给并肩作战的兄弟部队、烈军属和人民公社的社员拜年。
    在炮兵阵地上，旭日升起以后，便响起了手风琴、胡琴和三弦琴声，收音机旁也坐满了炮手。在某海军码头上，当元旦零点的钟声响起来的时候，几百名水兵和归国华侨学生在歌声、鞭炮声中，手携手跳起了集体舞。空军某部的飞行员，今天一早把自己用红纸写的决心书，贴到机场的黑板报上，决心给来犯的敌机以迎头痛击。
