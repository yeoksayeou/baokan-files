New Families in the People's Commune

In the countryside, with the establishment of the people's communes, thousands upon thousands of democratic and united new families have emerged. The situations reflected in this column are snippets of life from several new families in the Xitiejiaoying First Production Team of the Nanyuan People's Commune in Beijing. – Editor

A Happy Family

In the evening, the production team finishes work. Women's Team Leader Chen Xiulan returns from the fields, first pokes the stove to get the fire going, then washes her hands and face, changes into a clean blue cloth jacket, and goes to the commune canteen to get the meal. Her husband picks up their eldest grandson, Xiao Qing, from the kindergarten, and soon after, her daughter-in-law Yulin returns from the nursery group holding their second child, who is just two months old. The family gathers around the stove for a hearty dinner: steaming white rice and fragrant stir-fried cabbage. While they are eating, footsteps come from outside, and Xiao Qing, familiar with the sound, peeks out and shouts, "Papa!" Xiao Qing's father is Wang Lijin, a young man in his twenties, who works as a foundry worker in a machine tool factory not far from the village. He comes home every night, and when the child sees his father, he refuses to sit still and insists that his father sing the "Hello Auntie" song that he learned in kindergarten. Wang Lijin is struggling when the loudspeaker broadcasts that the Central People's Broadcasting Station is about to broadcast "Little Trumpet." The child's eyes widen as he listens intently, and when he hears a child singing "Hello Auntie" on the loudspeaker, he stands up, claps his hands, and sings along:

"Hello Auntie, good Auntie, Auntie is like my own mother, I smile when I see Auntie..." After dinner, daughter-in-law Yulin finishes feeding the baby, grabs her books and pen, and goes to the kang-head group for study. (Note: The kang-head group is a small study group, mainly to facilitate study for women with children.) Wang Lijin coaxes the child while humming a tune.

The Child's Father Has Changed

After getting up in the morning, Li Maolian helps the two youngest children get dressed and takes them to the kindergarten. Before leaving, he tells his wife, Yin Xiufeng, to go to the production team to work early and not be late. As he walks out the door, he turns back and says that he will fetch the firewood for the stove when he returns from the fields. She deeply appreciates her husband's meticulous care and feels the happiness and fulfillment of family life. She cannot help but smile knowingly at her husband.

Before the establishment of the people's commune, Yin Xiufeng was held back by her four children. At that time, Li Maolian was too lazy to even ask about the children or housework. In Yin Xiufeng's words, he was the kind of person who "wouldn't even pick up an oil bottle if he knocked it over." Once, because Yin Xiufeng returned late from the fields and was unable to prepare lunch on time, Li Maolian flew into a rage and pointed his finger at Yin Xiufeng, asking, "Why didn't you come back earlier?" Yin Xiufeng thought, you work for the agricultural cooperative, and I work for the agricultural cooperative, neither of us is idle; so she retorted, "Why can't you do some cooking?" This added fuel to the fire, and Li Maolian said with confidence, "Are you asking me to cook and take care of the children?" They argued, and in the end, Li Maolian still believed he was right. Since the establishment of the people's commune, the commune has established a series of welfare institutions such as canteens and nurseries, and Yin Xiufeng quickly threw herself into agricultural production, receiving wages for her labor every month. She felt that she was now completely liberated. Li Maolian also realized that his past inability to help and care for his wife was a manifestation of inequality between husband and wife. From then on, he took the initiative to care about housework.

Into the City

January 5th was a rest day for the production team. The night before, the Wang Longyi family discussed how to spend the holiday. The eldest son suggested going to Taoranting Park in the city. The third daughter said that the Spring Festival was approaching and urged her mother to go to the department store to buy floral fabric to make clothes. Wang Longyi's wife, He Shuqian, was afraid of spending money in the city and declined, saying that she had to sew and wash clothes at home and had no time to go. The old grandfather sat on the kang, stroked his beard, and said in a conciliatory tone, "I think we should go to Taoranting Park and the department store. I'll stay home and take care of the youngest." He enlightened his daughter-in-law, saying, "The commune gives us holidays so that everyone can rest well. You should also see what Beijing is like." The old grandfather's words broke through He Shuqian's thinking. Although He Shuqian was from Changxindian in Beijing, she had never been to the bustling Wangfujing Street. When she was a child, her family was poor and she had no leisure to stroll the streets. After liberation, life got better, but she was held back by housework. She also thought that now that the commune had rest days, if she didn't go, when would she go! So she readily agreed to go to the city.

The next day, the family got up very early, dressed neatly, ate breakfast in the canteen, and took the No. 66 bus north of the village to the city.

Leave the Children Behind

Geng Shuqing's mother missed her and had recently asked someone to send a letter asking Geng Shuqing to visit her. Unfortunately, it was particularly cold these days. Should she take the child? She thought about it and couldn't make up her mind. Just as she was about to discuss the child's accommodation with the kindergarten, her mother-in-law ran over and said, "Shuqing, you go ahead, I'll take care of the child."

Geng Shuqing and her mother-in-law had separated several years ago. In the past, when they lived together, they often had minor disagreements and their relationship was not very harmonious. Since the establishment of the commune, everyone has been eating and working together, and the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law has become much closer. People say that the commune is as united as a family, and the family is as united as one person.

### 人民公社中的新家庭

    人民公社中的新家庭
    在农村，随着人民公社的建立，出现了千千万万个民主团结的新家庭。这个专栏里所反映的情况，是北京市南苑人民公社西铁匠营第一生产队几个新家庭的生活片断。　——编者欢乐的家庭
    傍晚，生产队收工了。妇女队长陈秀兰从田间回来，先把炉火通了通，然后洗了手和脸，换了件干净的蓝布罩衫，便去公社食堂打饭。她丈夫从幼儿园接回大孙子小青，不一会儿媳妇玉林抱着刚满两个月的老二也从娃娃组回来了。一家人围着火炉，开始丰盛的晚餐：热腾腾的白米饭，香喷喷的炒白菜。正在吃着，外面传来一阵脚步声，小青熟悉地探头望了望，大声喊爸爸。小青的爸爸叫王立金，是一个二十多岁的年青人，他在离村子不远的一个机床厂当铸工，每晚回家住宿，孩子看见爸爸回来，便不肯老老实实坐着，硬要爸爸给他唱幼儿园新教的“阿姨好”的歌子，王立金正在为难，扩音器传出中央人民广播电台宣布“小喇叭”开始广播啦。孩子睁大两只小眼睛注意地听着，听到扩音器里真的有一个小朋友在唱“阿姨好”，孩子便站起来拍着小手跟着唱：
  “阿姨好，好阿姨，阿姨好像亲妈妈，见了阿姨笑哈哈……”。饭后，儿媳玉林给老二喂完奶，拿着书和笔去学习班，不一会李文秀来找陈秀兰一同去炕头组学习（注：炕头组是小型的学习组，主要为了便利有孩子的妇女学习），王立金哄着孩子，嘴里还哼着什么曲子。孩子的爸爸变了样
    早晨起床后，李茂连帮着两个最小的孩子穿好衣服，领着他们去幼儿园。临走前嘱咐妻子殷秀凤早点去生产队干活，不要迟到了。走出大门又回头说，烧火的柴等他下地回来去挑。对丈夫这种无微不至的关怀，她深深地体会到家庭生活的幸福和美满，不由得对着丈夫会意地笑了一笑。
    在人民公社建立以前，殷秀凤被四个孩子拖得寸步难行，那时李茂连对孩子、家务事连问也懒得问一声，用殷秀凤的话来说，在家里他是一个
  “跌倒油瓶不扶”的人。有一次，因为殷秀凤下地回来晚了，中午饭没能按时做好，李茂连就大发脾气，指着殷秀凤的鼻子问：“你为什么不早点回来？”殷秀凤心想，你给农业社干活，我也给农业社干活，谁也没有闲着呀；就顶上一句：“你为什么不能做做饭”？这下火上加油，李茂连理直气壮地说：“难道叫我做饭看孩子吗？”两人吵了一顿，最后李茂连还认为自己有理。自从人民公社建立后，社里办起了食堂和托儿所等一系列福利机构，殷秀凤很快地全力投入农业生产，月月领到自己劳动换来的工资。她觉得现在才彻底解放了。李茂连也认识到过去不能帮助和体贴妻子，是夫妻之间不平等的表现。从此，他主动地关心家务事。进城
    1月5日，是生产队的休息日。头一天晚上，社员王隆义一家人便商量如何过假日。大儿子提议进城去陶然亭玩，三女儿说快要过春节啦！动员妈妈上百货大楼买花布做衣服，王隆义的妻子何淑倩害怕进城要花钱，推辞说她要在家缝缝洗洗没工夫去。老爷爷坐在炕头上摸摸胡须带着调解的口气说：“我看陶然亭也去，百货大楼也去，我在家看管小四”。并开导儿媳妇说：“社里给的假日就要大伙休息的好，你也该去看看北京城是个什么样。”老爷爷这一说，打通了何淑倩的思想。何淑倩虽然是北京市长辛店人，但却没去过繁华的王府井大街。小时候家境困难，没有闲情逛大街，解放以后日子过好了，可又被家务活拖住脱不开身。她也想现在公社有了休息日不去，什么日子去呀！于是便一口答应进城。
    第二天，一家人起的很早，穿得干干净净，在食堂吃过早点后，便到村北大道坐着六十六路公共汽车进城了。把孩子留下吧
    耿淑清的娘家妈妈想念耿淑清，前些时候，就托人带信要耿淑清去看她。不巧这几天特别冷，孩子去不去？她想来想去拿不定主意，正要和幼儿园商量孩子住宿问题，她婆婆跑来说：“淑清，你去吧，孩子留给我看管。”
    耿淑清和婆婆分家已好几年了，从前在一起的时候，常为些小事婆媳不十分和睦。自公社成立后，大家又在一锅吃饭，一起劳动，婆媳间却变得亲热了，人们说公社团结的像一家人，一家人团结的像一个人。（附图片）
