The year 1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle. We must strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 than in 1958. The call for new battles inspires the victorious people's will to fight for new victories. Look, in factory workshops, in the fields of the communes, in school classrooms, on the front lines of national defense, the heroes at various combat posts are stepping from the end point of the great leap forward in 1958 into a new starting point, confidently beginning new battles to welcome this new year of leap forward.

    Anshan Iron and Steel workers are brimming with enthusiasm to welcome the New Year. Inspired by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, they summarized the experience of the great leap forward in 1958 and decided to use even greater labor enthusiasm, hard work, practical work, and ingenious work to push production in 1959 to a new high.
