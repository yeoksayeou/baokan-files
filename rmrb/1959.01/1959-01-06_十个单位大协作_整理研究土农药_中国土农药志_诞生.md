Ten Units Collaborate to Organize and Research Indigenous Pesticides
"The Chinese Indigenous Pesticide Gazetteer" is Born
(Our report) A new scientific work, "The Chinese Indigenous Pesticide Gazetteer," has recently been completed through the collaborative efforts of over one hundred individuals from ten units: the Institute of Entomology, Institute of Botany, and Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; the Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; the Institute of Materia Medica and the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; Beijing Agricultural University; the Ministry of Agriculture; the Ministry of Commerce; and the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, Party committees in various regions, guided by the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," led the masses in a vigorous campaign to develop indigenous pesticides. In just a few months, over five hundred types of indigenous pesticides were discovered and utilized nationwide, and more than 2.4 million indigenous pesticide factories were established. The amount of indigenous pesticides used in agricultural production exceeded 10,000 tons, playing a significant role in ensuring an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture and providing more favorable conditions for eliminating the Four Pests.

The variety of indigenous pesticides discovered in various regions was extensive, and especially with the integration of traditional Chinese medicine, many rich and colorful compound mixtures were created, urgently requiring scientific research and organization. Under the direction of the Party Group of the Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Entomology, in conjunction with the Institute of Botany and the Institute of Microbiology, together with the Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Institute of Materia Medica and the Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, the Plant Protection Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Production Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce, and the Technology Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, jointly organized an Indigenous Pesticide Research Office. Under the organization and coordination of the Ministry of Commerce, they simultaneously conducted scientific research and began compiling "The Chinese Indigenous Pesticide Gazetteer."

After more than two months of work, preliminary results have been achieved. In terms of experimental research, with the assistance of the Central Ministry of Commerce and commercial departments in various regions, more than five hundred types of indigenous pesticides have been collected. The collected samples were promptly sent to relevant research units in Beijing for organization and research. The Chemical Control Laboratory of the Institute of Entomology established a battle headquarters to fully summarize and study indigenous pesticides. The youth of the Classification Group of the Institute of Botany, under the direct leadership of the Party branch and with the help of veteran scientists, completed the identification, morphological description, and drawing of more than two hundred plant-based indigenous pesticides in a short period of time. The Institute of Microbiology organized a screening team to conduct research on the inhibition of germ spore germination by indigenous pesticides and plant inoculation experiments. Preliminary results obtained by various units have proven that many of the indigenous pesticides created by the broad masses are indeed of superior performance.

The compilation of "The Chinese Indigenous Pesticide Gazetteer" was completed in mid-December last year. The content includes 340 types of indigenous pesticides, nearly 200 color illustrations, and a total of approximately 500,000 words. The compilation work fully embodies the correctness of the Party's principle of scientific research serving production and construction, and theory being linked to practice. It also reflects the important significance of conducting large-scale communist collaboration in scientific research.

    十个单位大协作　整理研究土农药
    “中国土农药志”诞生
    本报讯　一部新的科学著作
  “中国土农药志”最近已由中国科学院昆虫研究所、植物研究所、微生物研究所和中国农业科学院植物保护研究所、中国医学科学院药物研究所、流行病防治所、北京农业大学、农业部、商业部、化工部十个单位的一百多人共同完成。
    在去年大跃进中，各地党委根据“土洋并举”的方针，领导群众大搞土农药运动。在短短几个月的时间内，全国发掘利用的土农药已有五百多种，兴办的土农药工厂二百四十多万座。在农业生产中使用的土农药数量在一万吨以上，对保证农业空前大丰收起了极大的作用，同时对消灭四害也提供了更有利的条件。
    各地发掘的土农药品种繁多，尤其是结合中药的特点创造了许多丰富多采的复方混合剂，急待进行科学研究，加以整理。昆虫研究所根据科学院党组指示，联合了植物所和微生物所，同中国农业科学院植物保护研究所、中国医学科学院药物研究所、流行病防治所、北京农业大学、农业部植保局、商业部生产资料局、化工部技术司，共同组织了土农药研究办公室，在商业部负责组织协调下，一面进行科学研究工作，一面着手编著“中国土农药志”。
    经过两个多月的工作，已获得初步成果。在试验研究方面，在中央商业部及各地商业部门的协助下，已收集到土农药的品种五百多种。并将收集到的样品及时发到北京各有关研究单位进行整理研究。昆虫研究所化学防治室成立了战斗指挥部，全力进行土农药的总结和研究工作。植物研究所分类组的青年，在党支部的直接领导和老科学家的帮助下，短期内完成了二百多种植物性土农药的品种鉴定、形态描述、绘图等工作。微生物研究所组织了筛洗大队，从土农药抑制病菌孢子发芽、植株接种试验等方面开展了研究。各单位所取得的初步结果证明，广大群众所创造的土农药有许多种确实是性能优越。
    “中国土农药志”一书的编纂工作已在去年12月中完成。内容包括土农药三百四十种，彩色图谱近二百幅，全书共约五十万字。在编写工作中，充分地体现了党提出的科学研究为生产建设服务、理论联系实际的方针的正确性，也体现了科学研究开展共产主义大协作的重要意义。
