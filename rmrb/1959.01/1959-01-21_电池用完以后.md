    After the Battery is Used Up
    You probably think that after the battery is used up, it is useless! Actually, that's not the case. The various chemical components in waste batteries, such as the zinc skin on the outer cylinder, the carbon powder on the rod, the copper cap on the end of the rod, and the electric paste made of manganese dioxide, graphite powder, ammonium chloride, zinc chloride, mercuric chloride, starch, and water filled around the carbon rod, are not completely consumed. If the remaining parts are refined, industrial raw materials accounting for about half of the original ingredients can still be obtained.
    According to experiments conducted by the Chongqing Waste Recycling Station, one ton of waste batteries can be processed to extract 42 kilograms of ammonium chloride, 125 kilograms of manganese dioxide, 160 kilograms of graphite powder, 45 kilograms of carbon rods, 8,000 bakelite caps, 59 kilograms of zinc skin, 4 kilograms of scrap copper, and 25 kilograms of waste paper.
    The recovered ammonium chloride can be reused as battery electrolyte, printing dyes, raw materials for the leather industry, and an important chemical fertilizer. Manganese dioxide can be used for iron smelting. Graphite powder can be used as a coating material in molds, coatings for buildings, and raw materials for manufacturing paints and leather softening oils. Carbon rods and bakelite caps can be reused. Zinc skin can be refined and melted into zinc ingots. Scrap copper and waste paper also have great uses. The consumption of batteries increases every year. If we pay attention to recycling waste batteries, it will be a great wealth.

    电池用完以后
    你大概以为电池用完电以后就没有用了吧！其实不是的。废电池里的多种化学成份，如外面筒上的锌皮，棒上的炭精粉，棒端的铜帽，炭棒周围填充的二氧化锰、石墨粉、氯化氨、氯化锌、氯化汞、淀粉和水制成的电糊等等，并没有完全消耗掉，若把余留部分加以提炼，仍可得到约占原配料一半的工业原料。
    根据重庆废品收购站的实验，一吨废电池经过加工可以提炼出四十二公斤氯化氨，一百二十五公斤二氧化锰，一百六十公斤石墨粉、四十五公斤炭棒、八千个电木盖、五十九公斤锌皮、四公斤杂铜、二十五公斤废纸。
    回收的氯化氨可重作电池的电解液、印刷染料、制革工业的原料和重要的化学肥料，二氧化锰可供炼铁用，石墨粉可作铸模内的涂复料、建筑用的涂料和制造油漆、皮韧油的原料，炭棒及电木盖可重新使用，锌皮提炼后可熔为锌锭、杂铜、废纸等，用处很大。电池的使用量年年增多，如果注意回收废电池，就是一笔很大的财富。
