Tianjin Actively Arranges Increased Production of Small Commodities

(Our dispatch from Tianjin, January 14th) Tianjin is actively expanding the production of small commodities, such as small general merchandise and small hardware items, while arranging the production of state-planned products for the first quarter, in order to meet the growing needs of urban and rural people.

Various small commodities are closely related to people's lives, and many are indispensable in daily life. With the increase in people's purchasing power and the realization of people's communes in rural areas, the demand for small commodities in urban and rural areas has surged. Various regions have requested Tianjin to supply large quantities of pacifiers, baby bottles, sewing needles, trouser hooks, collar hooks, as well as scissors, tweezers, sterilized cotton, and needle cases for medical use in the first quarter of this year. To this end, after conducting a survey and study of the current market supply and demand situation, Tianjin's commercial departments have put forward a list of hundreds of urgently needed small commodities for relevant departments to use as a basis for arranging the production of small commodities. These commodities include daily necessities such as scissors, locks, buckles, shoe eyelets, shoe nails, hairpins, and pacifiers, as well as cultural supplies such as pencil sharpeners, fountain pen cartridges, thumbtacks, and pins, and a small number of small medical devices necessary for health stations and clinics.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of relevant units such as industrial and commercial departments and the Municipal Materials Supply and Marketing Bureau to specifically study the issue of increasing the production of small commodities. The relevant units participating in the meeting, in response to the varieties provided by the commercial departments, held separate professional meetings on general merchandise, culture, small hardware, etc., and immediately arranged the production of these commodities. Some factories currently producing small commodities have decided to mobilize their workers to take measures to increase output. Some factories that previously produced small commodities but later switched to other products have decided to resume the production of the original small commodities. Some large factories producing state-planned products have also allocated some of their resources to produce small commodities. For example, the factory in Hongqiao District that produces electrical switches has allocated part of its resources to produce iron shovels, iron hooks, and iron kettles. The factory producing large medical devices has shifted all of its production capacity from producing ambulances to producing small medical supplies such as sterilized cotton and needle cases, and veterinary syringes. Through such active arrangements, the output and supply of many small commodities in Tianjin have increased several times compared to the fourth quarter of last year.

In order to solve the difficulties in the supply of certain raw materials, in addition to taking out a portion of the raw materials for the production of these small commodities from the inventory of the Tianjin Municipal Materials Supply and Marketing Bureau and commercial departments, the commercial departments will also send people to other places to find sources of goods and carry out mass waste recovery work. The industrial departments have decided to mobilize workers to find ways to reduce the consumption quotas of raw materials or study the use of substitutes. Because small commodities have small value and require less material, and can utilize the waste materials from large factories, a large number of small general merchandise and small hardware can be produced as long as some raw materials are allocated. For example, one ton of black iron sheet scrap can produce more than 1.1 million hairpins.

Currently, the Tianjin Municipal Materials Supply and Marketing Bureau has allocated more than 1,000 tons of flat iron, white iron sheet, native steel, and black iron sheet scraps for industrial departments to produce hardware cooking utensils such as kitchen knives and stir-frying spoons, as well as trouser hooks, hairpins, locks, and scissors. In order to increase production, the industrial departments are not only stepping up production but also trying to use machines instead of manual operations. The tool factory that produces kitchen knives recently installed an electric motor to replace manual polishing, which has increased production efficiency several times.

### 天津积极安排增产小百货

    天津积极安排增产小百货
    本报天津14日电　天津市在安排第一季度国家计划产品生产的同时，积极扩大小百货、小五金等小商品的生产，以满足城乡人民日益增长的需要。
    各种各样的小商品和人民生活关系很密切，不少是日常生活中所不可缺少的。随着人民购买力的提高和农村实现人民公社化，城乡人民对小商品的需要量激增。各地今年第一季度要求天津大量供应奶嘴、奶瓶、缝纫针、裤钩、领钩和医疗上用的剪刀、镊子、消毒棉和针盒等。为此，天津市商业部门在对当前市场供求情况进行了调查研究以后，提出了市场急需的数百种小商品的货单，供有关部门作为安排小商品生产的依据。这些商品中有剪刀、锁头、扣吊、鞋眼、鞋钉、发卡、奶嘴等生活用品，也有铅笔刀、钢笔胆和图钉、大头针等文化用品，还有为数不多、但为保健站、卫生所所必需的小件医疗器械。
    中共天津市委员会最近召集工商部门、市物资供销局等有关单位开会，专门研究小商品的增产问题。参加会议的有关单位针对商业部门提供的那些品种，分别举行了百货、文化、小五金等专业会议，立即安排这些商品的生产。目前正在生产小商品的一些工厂，决定发动职工采取措施增加产量，有些过去生产小商品而随后改制其他产品的工厂，决定恢复原来生产的小商品。有些生产国家计划产品的大工厂，还抽出一部分力量，用来生产小商品。例如红桥区生产电器开关的工厂，就划出部分力量生产铁铲、铁钩、铁水壶。生产大型医疗器械的工厂，把用来生产救护车的全部生产力，改产消毒棉和针盒、兽用注射器等小件医疗用品。经过这样积极的安排，天津市很多小商品的产量和供应量数倍于去年第四季度。
    为了解决某些原料供应的困难，生产这些小商品的原料，除由天津市物资供销局和商业部门的库存物资中拿出一部分以外，商业部门还将陆续派人到外地去寻找货源和开展群众性的废品回收工作。工业部门决定发动职工找窍门想办法，减低原材料消耗定额，或研究使用代用品等。由于小商品价值小，用料少，而且能够利用大工厂的下脚废料，所以只要拨付一些原料，就能生产出大量的小百货、小五金来。像一吨黑铁皮下脚就可产一百一十多万只发卡。
    目前，天津市物资供销局已拨出一千多吨扁铁、白铁皮、土钢和黑铁皮下脚料等，供工业部门生产菜刀、炒匙等五金炊事用具和裤钩、发卡、锁头、剪刀等。工业部门为了多增产，除加紧赶制外，还尽量采用机器代替人工操作。生产菜刀的工具厂，最近新安装了电动机代替人力磨光，生产效率因而提高了好几倍。
