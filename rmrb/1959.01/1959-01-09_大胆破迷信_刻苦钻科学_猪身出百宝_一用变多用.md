Boldly Break Superstition, Diligently Study Science
The Pig's Body Yields Treasures, One Use Becomes Many
Tianjin No. 2 Food Factory Vigorously Develops Comprehensive Utilization, Slaughterhouse Becomes a Joint Enterprise of Slaughtering, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, and Power Generation

(Our dispatch) Tianjin Food No. 2 Factory proposed the fighting goal of vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of pigs during the Great Leap Forward in May last year: "Liberate the mind greatly, plant red flags all over the factory; manage the treasure house well, open the treasure chest; take out hundreds of treasures, eat pork for free." Now they have extracted forty-eight kinds of medicines and chemical preparations from pigs, including cephalin, and have also established a biogas power station using pig manure and sewage. They have also extracted valuable vitamin B12 from the feces and sewage after the biogas production. This truly achieves: "Dig treasures from the pig's body, extract gold from the manure."

Tianjin Food No. 2 Factory is a large-scale meat processing factory built in 1953. For several years, some employees, especially some new workers, have had incorrect views on the work of the slaughterhouse. They said: "Slaughtering pigs and sheep, fate is not strong," "Wide cotton spinning, rich steel plant, lowly pig feeder." These ideas were not criticized in time. As a result, the management of the enterprise has been in a backward state for a long time, and the financial plan has to be at a loss every year.

Since the Great Leap Forward, there have still been various arguments among the employees: First, "Special Theory": thinking that the slaughterhouse is only about getting pigs in and meat out, the business is simple, and there is no way to leap forward; Second, "Destiny Theory": thinking that the listed price is stipulated by the state, and the purchase price of live pigs is high, how can it not be a loss? Third, "Passive Theory": thinking that pigs are unified purchase materials, the factory has no right to allocate, pigs come in sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, the factory sometimes shuts down, sometimes is too busy, the cost will increase, anyway, no pigs come, everything is empty talk.

The Party Committee of Tianjin Food No. 2 Factory believes that these views are essentially emphasizing objective difficulties and not seeing the strength of the masses. To enable the enterprise's production and operation to leap forward, these right-leaning conservative ideas must be thoroughly criticized. Then, a comprehensive "theoretical" method was adopted to examine business ideas and launch a great debate. At the same time, the Party Committee Secretary (also the factory director) reported the poor management of the factory to all employees, handed the problem over to the masses, and mobilized all employees to launch a great debate. In this way, everyone from top to bottom checked their thoughts, discussed their understanding, exposed loopholes, and thought of ways. Various conservative ideas and erroneous arguments were criticized.

After refuting right-leaning conservative ideas, the Party Committee led the employees to switch to the activity of debating and calculating accounts. Everyone tapped potential and looked for tricks. In just four days, more than 8,000 suggestions were made. In addition to suggestions on improving business operations and reducing costs, breaking single operation and fully utilizing waste by-products has also become a major content of the suggestions. Some suggested using head hooves and internal organs to process various kinds of sauce products, and many people also suggested using waste by-products to make medicine. Such as using pig lungs to make asthma medicine, pig gallbladders to make knife wound medicine, pig pancreas to make diabetes medicine, etc... Although these suggestions were relatively general, some were just a "shadow," but they pointed out the direction for comprehensive utilization.

The direction was put forward. But at that time, some people still had different views on vigorously developing comprehensive utilization. Some cadres and technicians, including some workers, believed: "There is no profit in comprehensive utilization of slaughterhouses, and nothing can be achieved." They believe that since ancient times, pork and offal have only been eaten, and manure can only be used as fertilizer; the production of major meat processing plants across the country is only getting pigs in and meat out, is comprehensive utilization not engaging in improper activities? In response to these problems, the Party Committee once again launched a debate among all employees. The method is to first be "theoretical" and then be "practical", analyze the reasons, and propose measures. At the same time, the Party Committee Secretary presided over a forum for technicians to encourage them to talk freely about their understanding and engage in free debate.

After two days of debate, most employees clarified their thinking and realized that as long as they think of more ways, they can make full use of waste materials. Only a very few people still held a skeptical attitude. At this time, some technicians suggested using waste pig hair, internal organs, and blood tendons to make chemical soy sauce. Skeptical people said, "Is it too simple! Let's try it out." Others poured cold water and said, "Who will eat it when it's made?" In order to educate them with facts, the Party Committee took advantage of the situation and strongly supported the trial production of soy sauce. After efforts, a good quality animal soy sauce was successfully trial-produced. This soy sauce was tested by the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Station and fully met the edible standards. This certificate of conformity powerfully refuted the "watchers" and convinced them, breaking through the first barrier of comprehensive utilization.

The Party Committee of this factory seized this vivid fact in a timely manner, conducted extensive and in-depth publicity and education among the masses, and put forward the slogan: "Dare to think and dare to do, create miracles, strive for first place in comprehensive utilization." Then, worker Wang Wenyun and others, with the support of technicians from the Tianjin Institute of Chemistry, used the waste water that had been poured into the ditch when washing bitter gallbladders in the past to make bile acid, the raw material for medicines such as methyltestosterone and ursodeoxycholic acid, jumping out of the circle of making food. At the same time, some employees suggested that live pig internal organs and endocrine glands can be used as raw materials for many drugs.

The problem of whether or not to engage in comprehensive utilization has been resolved, and the goals have also been put forward, but what methods should be used? Simply use foreign methods or combine indigenous and foreign methods? Only rely on large-scale national investment and technical experts, or make do with simple equipment and rely on self-reliance?

To achieve comprehensive utilization, many technical problems must be solved, especially the extraction of various valuable medicines from pig internal organs and endocrine glands, which involves relatively complex issues such as operating technology and production equipment. In order to specialize in comprehensive utilization, the factory newly established a pharmaceutical research office.

In vigorously publicizing and implementing the general line of socialist construction, combined with the actual situation, focusing on breaking superstitions and liberating the mind. And the result of organizing employees to debate on "Can indigenous methods make medicine?" was that the workers all said yes.

As soon as the debate ended, a vigorous mass technological revolution was set off. Vigorously developing comprehensive utilization has become the common focus of attention of the entire factory. Everyone studies comprehensive utilization, talks about comprehensive utilization everywhere, and every workshop and every process digs for "treasures" from the part of the pig they come into contact with. Inspection personnel studied extracting treasures from internal organs, oil boiling workers looked for tricks in waste meat soup, and breeding workers focused on feed and pig manure. From processing workers to breeders, inspectors, and veterinarians, they all participated in this movement. Even the doctors in the clinic treated employees during the day and studied comprehensive utilization at night. In just a few days, more than 11,000 suggestions related to technological revolution were put forward, of which more than 30% were related to solving the technical and equipment problems of comprehensive utilization.

Unveiling the mysteries of nature and extracting treasures from pig waste and by-products is a very complex and arduous task. On the one hand, it requires liberating the mind and promoting the style of daring to think and daring to do. On the other hand, it also requires a pragmatic style, and requires hard work. Therefore, while mobilizing the masses to liberate their minds and create boldly, the Party Committee paid attention to advocating seeking truth from facts and studying diligently, advocating establishing a scientific attitude, paying attention to making full use of the achievements of modern science, and put forward: "Think boldly, learn modestly, study diligently, and try tenaciously."

In the technological revolution, under the leadership of various branches, technical groups composed of administrative leading cadres, veteran workers and technicians were formed, so that the scientific knowledge and expertise of technicians and the rich practical experience of veteran workers were closely combined. Later, the pharmaceutical workshop established in the factory (changed from the pharmaceutical research office) also implemented the spirit of "three combinations" in the same way. There, workers and technicians brainstormed to find information and study the trial production of new products. Technicians also rolled up their sleeves and worked like workers. In this way, the state of separation between mental and physical labor in the past was broken, and the combination of theory and practice, technology and labor was promoted. Many suggestions made by workers, with the participation of technicians, overcame the difficulties in technical operation. Technicians, in the process of experimenting and creating together with workers, integrated with the workers, and gradually overcame the ideological style of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses in the past, and were welcomed by the workers.

In order to fully utilize existing scientific achievements, the Party Committee paid attention to criticizing the ideas of a few people who only wanted to do it themselves behind closed doors and were unwilling to learn from others, advocated humbly learning from the outside, and vigorously engaged in communist cooperation with scientific research departments to strive for their support, so that the factory's research work could avoid detours. The factory also successively sent many cadres to research departments and pharmaceutical departments in Wuhan, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Beijing and other places to learn about the principles of pharmaceutical manufacturing. It has also successively linked up with the Chemical Research Institute, Beijing Medical College, Tianjin Science and Technology Association and other institutions in the city and Shanghai, exchanging research data with each other, and receiving their strong assistance. For example, when workers studied extracting cephalin from pig spinal cord, they failed after three trials. Later, they contacted technicians from the Tianjin Institute of Chemistry and, with their assistance, finally succeeded.

As a result of the close combination of workers and technicians and their diligent study, many new products were successfully trial-produced one after another. For example, the comrades of the pharmaceutical workshop snatched many pharmaceutical topics, moved their bedding to the workshop, fought tenaciously, failed again and again, overcame the technical and equipment difficulties, and used indigenous methods to make waste bones into activated carbon, pig hair into foam fire extinguishing liquid, waste blood tendons into peptone, bitter gallbladders into bile salts...making the flower of comprehensive utilization bloom all over the factory.

As a result of vigorously launching mass movements and making great efforts in comprehensive utilization, the factory's production outlook has undergone fundamental changes. It has changed from a simple slaughterhouse of "getting pigs in and meat out" into a joint enterprise including slaughtering, pork processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical preparations, starch, and power generation. In addition to the pork, pig by-products and medicines and chemical preparations extracted from pig bodies and pig manure mentioned above, the products also include chlortetracycline for animals, demeclocycline, tetraflavine, blood sugar, caustic soda, alcohol, starch, etc. While developing sideline businesses, due to vigorously launching mass movements, the "main business" has also greatly developed. The processing capacity of the processing workshop has been greatly improved compared with the past, the cost has also been greatly reduced, and the mortality rate of pigs has been reduced by half compared with the previous year. As a result of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, not only did the factory completely reverse the situation of losing money year after year, and handed over profits to the state, but also created extremely favorable conditions for a greater leap forward this year.

### 大胆破迷信　刻苦钻科学  猪身出百宝　一用变多用

    大胆破迷信　刻苦钻科学
    猪身出百宝　一用变多用
    天津食品二厂大搞综合利用，屠宰场变成屠宰、制药、发电联合企业
    本报讯　“思想大解放，红旗插遍厂；管好百宝库，打开百宝箱；取出百种宝，猪肉白吃上。”这是天津食品二厂在去年5月间大跃进中提出大搞猪的综合利用的战斗目标。现在他们已经从猪身上提取了包括脑磷脂等药品和化学制剂四十八种，同时还利用猪粪和污水建立了沼气发电站，并从产生沼气以后的粪便污水中，提取了价值昂贵的维生素B12。真正作到了：“猪身挖百宝，粪里掏黄金”。
    天津食品二厂是1953年建成的一个大型肉类加工厂。几年来，部分职工特别是一些新工人，对屠宰场的工作存在着不正确的看法。他们说：“杀猪宰羊，命运不强”，“阔棉纺，富钢厂，低三下四喂猪郎”。这些思想并没有及时得到批判。这样，就使得企业的经营管理长期处于落后状态，每年都要作赔钱的财务计划。
    大跃进以来，职工中仍然存在着各种各样的论调：一、“特殊论”：认为屠宰场是进猪出肉，业务单纯，没有跃进门路；二、“定局论”：认为牌价是国家规定的，生猪进价又高，怎能不赔呢？三、“被动论”：认为猪是统购物资，厂里没有调拨权，猪来的忽多忽少，厂里有时停工，有时忙不过来，费用就要增大，反正不来猪，啥都是空谈。
    中共天津食品二厂党委认为这些看法实质上都是强调了客观困难，看不见群众的力量。要使企业生产经营能跃上去，就必须彻底批判这些右倾保守思想。接着采取了全面务“虚”的方法，检查经营思想，展开大辩论。同时，党委书记（兼厂长）又向全体职工报告了工厂经营不善的情况，把问题交给群众，发动全体职工，展开大辩论。这样，上下一起查思想、谈认识、揭发漏洞、想办法，各种保守思想和错误论调都受到了批判。
    在驳倒了右倾保守思想之后，党委领导职工转入边辩论边算账的活动。人人挖潜力，找窍门，仅四天内就提出建议八千多件。除提出改善业务经营，降低费用等方面的建议外，打破单一经营，充分利用废副产品也成为建议的一个主要内容。有的提出用头蹄、内脏加工各种各样的酱制品，许多人还提出用废副产品制药。如用猪肺制喘药、苦胆制刀伤药，猪胰子制治糖尿药等……这些建议虽然比较笼统，有的仅是个“影子”，但却给综合利用指出了方向。
    方向是提出来了。但当时有的人对大搞综合利用，仍然有不同的看法。一部分干部和技术人员也包括一部分工人认为：“屠宰场搞综合利用没有油水，搞不出什么名堂来。”他们认为：自古以来，猪肉和下水只是吃吃而已，粪便只能当肥料用；全国各大肉类加工厂的生产都是进猪出肉，搞综合利用是不是不务正业？针对这些问题，党委又发动全体职工展开辩论。方法是先务“虚”，后务“实”，分析原因，提出措施。同时，由党委书记主持召开了技术人员座谈会，启发他们畅谈认识，展开自由争辩。
    经过为时两天的辩论，大多数职工都明确了思想，认识到只要多想办法，就能充分利用废料。只有极个别的人，还抱着半信半疑的态度。这时，有的技术人员提出用废猪毛、内脏及血筋制作化学酱油的建议。怀疑的人就说：“看的太简单了吧！试试看吧。”还有的人泼冷水说：“制出来谁吃？”为了用事实教育他们，党委就趁热打铁，大力支持试制酱油工作。经过努力，一种质量良好的动物性酱油试制成功了。这种酱油经市防疫站化验完全合乎食用标准。这一张化验的合格单，有力地驳倒了“观潮派”，使他们口服心服，突破了综合利用的第一关。
    这个厂的党委及时抓住这活生生的事实，在群众中进行广泛深入的宣传教育，并提出：“敢想敢干创奇迹综合利用争第一”的口号。接着工人王文运等在天津化学研究所技术人员的支持下，利用过去洗苦胆倒在地沟里的废水制成甲基睪丸素和熊胆酸等药品的原料——胆汁酸，跳出了作食品的圈子。同时有的职工提出生猪内脏及内分泌腺可以作许多药物的原料的建议。
    要不要搞综合利用的问题解决了，奋斗目标也提出来了，但是用什么方法搞？单纯用洋办法还是土洋结合？仅仅依靠国家的大量投资和技术专家，还是因陋就简、自力更生？
    要作到全面综合利用，就要解决许多技术难题，特别是从猪内脏和内分泌腺取出多种贵重药品，牵涉到操作技术和生产设备等比较复杂的问题。为了专门搞综合利用，厂里新成立了制药研究室。
    在大张旗鼓地宣传贯彻社会主义建设总路线中，结合实际情况，着重破除迷信，解放思想。并组织职工对“土办法能不能制药？”开展辩论的结果，工人们都说行。
    辩论一结束，一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革命热潮掀起来了。大搞综合利用成为全厂上下的共同注意中心，人人研究综合利用，到处谈论综合利用，每个车间，每个工序都从自己接触的猪身上的部分去挖“宝”。检验人员研究从内脏中取宝，熬油的工人从废肉汤里找窍门，饲养工人则从饲料和猪粪上打主意。从加工工人到饲养员、检验人员、兽医都投入了这一运动，甚至连医务室的大夫，白天给职工看病，晚上也研究搞综合利用。在短短几天内，就提出有关技术革命的建议一万一千多件，其中有关解决综合利用的技术和设备问题的，就占30％以上。
    揭穿自然的奥秘，从猪的废品和副产品中取宝，是一件十分复杂艰巨的工作。一方面需要解放思想发扬敢想敢干的风格，同时也需要实事求是的作风，需要经过艰苦的劳动。因此，党委在发动群众解放思想大胆创造的同时，注意提倡实事求是刻苦钻研，提倡树立科学态度，注意充分利用现代科学的成果，并提出：“大胆地想，虚心地学，刻苦地钻，顽强地试”。
    在技术革命中，在各支部的领导下，组成了行政领导干部、老工人和技术人员参加的技术小组，使技术人员的科学知识和专长与老工人的丰富的实际经验，密切结合起来。后来厂里成立的制药车间（由制药研究室改成），也同样地贯彻了“三结合”的精神。在那里，工人和技术人员一道动脑筋找资料，研究试制新产品，技术人员也和工人一样卷起袖子干活。这样，就打破了过去脑力劳动和体力劳动脱离的状态，促进了理论与实践、技术和劳动的结合。许多工人提出的建议，在技术人员的参与下，克服了技术操作上的困难。技术人员在同工人共同试验、创造过程中，和工人打成一片，逐步克服了过去的脱离实际、脱离群众的思想作风，受到工人们的欢迎。
    为了充分地利用现有的科学成果，党委注意批判少数人员中的只愿关门自己搞，不愿学习旁人的思想，提倡虚心向外边学习，和科学研究部门大搞共产主义协作，争取他们的支持，使厂里的研究工作少走弯路。厂里还先后派出许多干部到武汉、石家庄、上海、北京等地研究部门、制药部门学习有关制药的原理。还先后与本市和上海的化学研究所、北京医学院、天津科学技术协会等挂上了钩，彼此交换研究资料，得到了他们的大力协助。如工人们研究利用猪脊髓提取脑磷脂时，经三次试制，均告失败，后来和天津化学研究所技术人员联系，在他们的协助下，终于获得了成功。
    工人和技术人员密切结合，刻苦钻研的结果，许多新产品接二连三地试制成功了。像制药车间的同志抢走了许多制药课题后，把铺盖搬到车间，顽强地战斗，失败一次又接着一次，克服了技术和设备上的重重困难，用土办法把废骨头制成活性炭，猪毛制成泡沫灭火液，废血筋制成蛋白胨，苦胆制成胆盐……使综合利用之花，开遍全厂。
    大搞群众运动，大闹综合利用的结果，这个厂的生产面貌起了根本的变化。从一个单纯“进猪出肉”的屠宰场变成一个包括屠宰、猪肉加工、制药、化学制剂、淀粉、发电等的联合企业。产品除了上面提到的猪肉、猪副产品和从猪身、猪粪中提取的药品和化学制剂外，还包括畜用金霉素、地霉素、四黄素、血糖、火碱、酒精、淀粉等。在发展副业的同时，由于大搞群众运动，“正业”也有很大的发展。加工车间的加工能力比过去大大提高，费用也大大降低，猪的死亡率比前年降低了一半。由于全面大跃进的结果，不但使这个厂彻底地扭转了连年赔钱的局面，给国家上缴了利润，并且为今年的更大的跃进，创造了极其有利的条件。（附图片）
