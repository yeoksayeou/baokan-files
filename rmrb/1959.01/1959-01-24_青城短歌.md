    Qingcheng Short Songs

    Boiling Daqing Mountains
    Morning, the dawn is misty. I climb to the top of the five-story building of Inner Mongolia University, bathed in the morning sun, facing north.
    To the north, peaks stand tall, layer upon layer. This is the famous anti-Japanese base area of the people of Inner Mongolia—the Daqing Mountains. “Daqing Mountains, mountain after mountain, countless anti-Japanese heroes!” The people still sing of it today.
    Ah, Daqing Mountains! How many hardships have you experienced, and how many talents have you cultivated!
    Now, as a historical giant, holding a beautiful blueprint, issues the solemn call to "build socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results," you, Daqing Mountains, immediately become the battlefield for the labor of the Mongolian and Han people.
    Look, hundreds of thousands of labor troops are coming!
    Look, countless scaffolding is erected!
    Look, on the Shanxi border, the first large reservoir in the autonomous region—the Usutu Reservoir—has been completed!
    Look, on the Shandong border, the first people-run railway in the autonomous region—the Huhehot-Halaqin Railway—is open to traffic!
    Ah, the roar of wheels, the roar of explosives. The entire Daqing Mountains—is boiling!…
    New Look of the Ancient City
    Beneath the Daqing Mountains, in the Tumochuan Plain, there is an ancient cyan city. It is a sapphire-blue night pearl, embedded in the hearts of the people of the autonomous region, forever radiating infinite light.
    This is the capital of the autonomous region—Hohhot.
    Ah, Hohhot—the cyan city! You are a witness to history.
    In those dark years full of class oppression and national discrimination, you were divided into two cities, old and new: “The new city and the old city are forever enemies!” [Note] Whether people call you "Guihua," "Suiyuan," or "Guisui," you are still covered in tears. At that time, you stood silently in this desolate wilderness, watching the dim sunset and crows, listening to the heavy and lonely sound of camel bells…
    But when our great republic was born, you, this ancient city, were resurrected! And, fundamentally changed!
    The Mongolian and Han people happily used their own hands to build a wide tree-lined avenue, four or five miles long, one end connected to the new city, and the other end leading to the old city. Since then, countless tall buildings have appeared on both sides of this cement road—the new city and the old city are connected into one, and their boundaries have been eliminated!
    This is just one example. Like People's Park, Xinhua Street, Ulanqab Theater, Cinema Palace, Gymnasium… Just these names alone, which one doesn't excite people! They are all symbols of the unity of the Mongolian and Han nationalities in the autonomous region, and also the achievements of the people of all ethnic groups in socialist construction.
    During the Great Leap Forward in steel production, Qingcheng was illuminated by red light day and night. People smashed ore on the main roads and built blast furnaces on the ancient city walls. Whether it was day or night, the roar of motors and singing were everywhere. For the steel satellite to go to heaven, for the victory of the industrial front, people fought hard.
    In this way, your ancient city, which only had a few dilapidated flour mills before liberation, has established a new type of industrial system: Hohhot Medium-Sized Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, Machinery Factory, Machine Tool Factory, Chemical Factory, Transformer Factory, Automobile Factory, Woolen Mill… You have gradually become a center city for machinery manufacturing industry and chemical industry…
    Hohhot! Roads are extending around you, and buildings are being erected in front of you. How you are changing and developing!
    In the spring sunshine, the magnificent Drum Tower stands tall, and the flowers bloom in the street gardens. I saw the Inner Mongolia Museum standing in the city center square. This white, tall building is solemn and beautiful, and on top of the building is sculpted a galloping horse with loose reins. It seems to raise its head and gallop, towards the green grassland, towards the blue mountain peaks, towards the golden gate of communism…
    Note: Hohhot has two cities, old and new. The old city was built by the Mongolians during the Ming Dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, in order to suppress the people's resistance, a new city was built to the southeast of the old city.
    No Winter Before Zhaojun's Tomb
    South of Qingcheng, on the banks of the Dahei River, there is Zhaojun's Tomb.
    In front of Zhaojun's Tomb, the poplars rustle, and the red flags flutter. The deep plowing army of the Taohua People's Commune, with more than 3,700 people, is waging war on this land.
    Twenty degrees below zero, heavy snow is falling. However, these agricultural warriors holding shovels and picks don’t seem to feel it at all. They say, “The cold weather cannot cool our determination, and the frozen ground cannot freeze our perseverance!” They work day and night like this, finally, the task of deep plowing on a large area of more than 1,000 mu was successfully completed!…
    Ah, Zhaojun's Tomb, you have been called Qingzhong (Green Tomb) since ancient times. Du Fu once wrote: “Once gone from the purple platform, connecting to the northern desert, only the green tomb remains facing the dusk.” For thousands of years, you have been lonely facing the desolate grass and setting sun. The Dahei River weeps and flows quietly by your side. Century after century. This place has been full of suffering and war, where can there be peace.
    Only in the era when the people are in power, in today’s continuous creation of miracles, has this place completely changed. There is no winter in front of Zhaojun's Tomb.
    Therefore, the Dahei River laughs happily…

    青城短歌
    奎曾
    沸腾的大青山
    清晨，晓雾蒙胧。我登上内蒙古大学五层大楼的楼顶，沐着朝阳，面向北方。
    北方，群峰屹立，叠叠重重。这就是著名的内蒙人民的抗日根据地——大青山。“大青山，山套山，抗日英雄千千万！”人民至今传颂着。
    啊，大青山！你经历过多少苦难，又培育了多少英才！
    而今，当一位历史的巨人，拿着美丽的蓝图，发出“多快好省地建设社会主义”的庄严号召时，你，大青山，又立即成了蒙汉各族人民劳动的战场。
    看啊，几十万劳动大军开来了！
    看啊，无数的脚手架竖起来了！
    看啊，山西边，自治区的第一座大水库——乌素图水库建成了！
    看啊，山东边，自治区的第一条民办铁路——呼（和浩特）哈（拉沁）铁路通车了！
    啊啊，车轮巨响，炸药轰鸣。整个大青山——沸腾了！……
    古城新貌
    大青山下，土默川中，有一座青色的古城。它是一颗蔚蓝色的夜明珠，嵌在自治区各族人民的心上，永远放射着无穷尽的光芒。
    这就是自治区的首府——呼和浩特市。
    啊，呼和浩特——青色的城！你是历史的见证人。
    在那些充满了阶级压迫和民族歧视的阴暗的年代里，你被分为新旧二城：“新城与旧城，永远结仇恨！”〔注〕不论人们称呼你是“归化”、“绥远”，或是“归绥”，你依然满面泪痕。那时，你默默地屹立在这荒漠的旷野里，看着那昏黄的落日寒鸦，听着那沉重而寂寥的驼铃的响声……
    可是，当我们伟大的共和国诞生时，你这座古城，复活了！而且，根本地变了！
    蒙汉各族人民愉快地用自己的双手，修建了一条四、五里长的宽阔的林荫大道，一端连到新城，一端通往旧城。从此，无数幢高楼大厦出现在这条水泥大道的两旁——新城与旧城连成一片了，它们的界限消灭了！
    这只是一个例子。像人民公园，新华大街，乌兰恰特，电影宫，体育馆……单就这些名字来说，又哪一个不使人们激动啊！它们都是自治区蒙汉民族团结的象征，也是各族人民在社会主义建设中的成果。
    在大战钢铁的时候，青城日日夜夜，红光满天。人们在大马路上砸矿石，在古城墙上建高炉。无论是白昼还是深夜，到处马达轰隆，歌声四起。为了钢铁卫星上天，为了工业战线胜利，人们苦战不停。
    就这样，你这座解放前只有几家破旧的面粉厂的古城，已经建立起一个新型的工业体系：呼和浩特中型钢铁联合企业、机械厂。机床厂、化工厂、变压器厂、汽车厂、毛织厂……你已经一步步地成为一个机械制造工业和化学工业的中心城市了。……
    呼和浩特啊！一条条大路正向你的四周伸展开去，一幢幢大楼正在你的面前建立起来。你是怎样在变化，在发展着啊！
    在春天的阳光下，金碧辉煌的鼓楼巍然矗立，街头花园里鲜花朵朵盛开。我看见那屹立在市中心广场上的内蒙古博物馆了。这座白色的高大的建筑物庄严而又美丽，在高楼的上面，雕塑着一匹撒缰的烈马。它像要昂首飞奔，向着那绿色的草原，向着那蓝色的山峰，向着那金色的共产主义的大门……
    注：呼和浩特有新旧二城。旧城系明代蒙族人民所建，到清朝时为了镇压人民的反抗，又在旧城的东南方建立了一座新城。
    昭君坟前无冬天青城之南，大黑河畔，有昭君坟。
    昭君坟前，白杨萧萧，红旗飘飘。桃花人民公社三千七百余人的深翻大军，正在这向大地开战。
    零下二十度，大雪纷飞。但是，这些手执铁锹和镐头的农业战士们似乎根本没有觉得。他们说：“天冷冷不了决心，地冻冻不了恒心”！他们就这样不分昼夜地干，干，干，终于，千余亩地的大面积深翻的任务胜利完成了！……
    啊，昭君坟，你自古称为青冢。杜甫吟咏过：“一去紫台连朔漠，独留青冢向黄昏。”千百年来，你一直寂寞地对着荒草斜阳。大黑河呜咽着，静静地从你身旁流过。一个世纪又一个世纪。这儿饱经着苦难和战争，哪里会有安宁。
    也只有在人民掌握政权的时代，在不断创造奇迹的今天，这儿完全变了样。昭君坟前无冬天。
    于是，大黑河欢笑了……
