We Made a Locomotive
Linfen Machinery Factory Worker Han Yanqing (oral), Ji Hua (recorder)

On the afternoon of September 5th last year, Secretary Dong told us that the Party Committee wanted us to build a locomotive before National Day to support the people-run Linpu Railway. Who wouldn't be happy about this? I was the first to sign up, and Comrade Sun Yuqing also signed up. Secretary Dong said he would participate too. We formed a shock team of seven or eight people.

Our Linfen Machinery Factory used to only make walking plows and double-furrow plows. As for making trains, we had never even dared to think about it. But could we fail to complete the task assigned by the Party? The first difficulties we encountered were materials and technology. Secretary Dong and we were all very anxious. Someone told Secretary Dong that the Linfen County Party Committee had a 100-horsepower boiler, so we bought it. We also went to the Linfen Railway Warehouse and found several scrapped locomotive pilot wheels. In this way, we put together several large parts. But it still wasn't enough; we were missing many things like steam chests, connecting rods, coupling rods, and underframe beams. We couldn't find them anywhere. What should we do? I suggested to Secretary Dong: let's make them ourselves! Secretary Dong didn't say anything, but Lao Sun interjected: "Is that going to work? We don't have machine tools or drawings. Who knows how to make them!" I said, let's learn! Let's go to the station to visit and observe. Secretary Dong also thought this was a good idea and happily said: That's right! Let's do that. Lao Sun also got motivated. We rode our bikes to the station right away. There was a locomotive parked there, impressively puffing out thick smoke. We explained our intentions to the station, and they welcomed us and sent Driver Guo to take us to see it up close. This look really surprised us. We had seen trains countless times in the past, but who had ever looked at them carefully? We didn't expect this thing to be so complicated, with many parts such as large and small steam pipes that I couldn't even name. Lao Sun seemed a little worried too. We had taken on the task. Could we say we wouldn't do it? I went to Lao Guo and asked him for guidance: Lao Guo, please give us some pointers! Lao Guo introduced us to several important parts, such as the underframe and transmission. As he spoke, I took notes and spread the paper on the ground to draw. With these drawings, we cast the parts ourselves according to the measured dimensions. We were very busy in those days, getting up before dawn. Before others started work, we were already working. We worked and thought at the same time. We worked hard like this for more than ten days, and most of the parts were made. When we assembled them, problems arose. The parts were all made with crude methods, and they didn't fit properly; they were either too long or too short. We filed and ground them all day long. Everything else was easy to handle, but the underframe beam was a bit troublesome. We didn't have angle iron, so we folded it from thick iron plates in the factory. We originally estimated that 250 centimeters high would be enough, but who knew it wouldn't fit on the frame and wouldn't catch the axle. We went to the station again to measure the dimensions and added 150 centimeters before it was finally resolved.

The completion of the small train immediately caused a sensation throughout the factory. It was decided to test the train that afternoon. We lit the furnace fire and laid a long section of track. Driver Guo sat in the cab. When we saw the small train we made ourselves was about to start, we couldn't express the joy in our hearts. This thing hissed a little steam and started moving. Who knew it would stop after only a few steps. We had to help with iron crowbars, turning half a wheel and stopping, not moving a few steps. Our hearts immediately cooled down. What was going on?! We couldn't find the problem for a while. Lao Sun was sweating profusely, and I was almost in tears. At this time, the Party Secretary walked up to us and said gently: "It's not bad to go this far. It's the first test! Rest today and think about it more tomorrow."

That night, I didn't sleep all night, thinking over and over again. Suddenly, I thought the problem might be in the steam chest. I jumped up immediately and woke Lao Sun. It was almost dawn. We opened the steam chest but couldn't find any problems. Driver Guo said the crank arm was too short, so we ground the crank arm 15 centimeters longer, but it still didn't work. We pondered for two days like this, and finally found the problem. It turned out that the angle between the crank arm and the pull rod was too small, and the wheel's rotation range was not large enough, which caused the steam valve to not supply steam in time. We moved the crank arm, enlarged the angle, and tested it again. It was perfect. The small train was chugging steadily on the dirt track, moving forward and backward very smoothly. The whole factory was active again. That day was September 28th, and the day after tomorrow was National Day. We completed the task two days ahead of schedule.

    我们造出了火车头
    临汾机械厂工人  韩延庆  口述  季华  记录
    去年9月5日下午，董支书向我们传达党委要我们在国庆节前，制成一个火车头，支援民办临浦铁路。这谁能不高兴呢？我第一个报了名，孙玉庆同志也报了名。董支书说我也参加。我们七、八个人组成了突击小组。
    我们临汾机械厂过去只能造步犁、双铧犁，要说制造火车，连想也没敢想过。党给的任务能不完成吗？首先遇到的是材料和技术的困难，董书记和我们都挺着急。不知是谁告诉董书记说临汾县委有个一百马力的锅驼机，我们就去买下了。又到临汾铁路仓库，找了几个报废的机车前导轮。这样七拼八凑地闹了几个大零件。可是还不行，像汽箱、传动杆、合并杆、底架大梁缺的很多。找是找不到了，怎么办呢？我向董书记提议：我们自己造吧？！董书记倒没说什么，老孙就插言了：“那能行！一没机床，二没图表，谁知怎样造呀！”我说学?！到车站去参观。董书记也觉得这是个门道，高兴的说：对！就这么办。老孙也有了劲头。当时我们就骑着车子，跑到车站。那里正停着一辆机车，神气地一口口吐着浓烟。我们向车站说明了来意，他们很欢迎，并派郭司机领着我们到跟前去看，这一看可把我们楞着了，过去火车不知见过多少次，可谁仔细看过？没想这玩艺，这么复杂，大汽管、小汽管不少的零件，我都叫不上名堂。看样子老孙也有点发愁。任务是包下来了，能说不干吗？我走到老郭跟前向他请教说：老郭你就给我们指点指点吧！老郭向我们介绍了几个重要部分，如底架部分，传动部分。他一边说着，我一边记着，又把纸铺在地上划着。这算有了图表，我们就按着量下的尺寸，自己铸造。那几天我们可忙了，天还未亮就起床，别人没上工哪，我们就干开了。一边干一边琢磨，我们就这样苦干了十几天，一般零件都制成了。装配时出了问题，零件都是土造的，不合缝，不是长就是短。我们锉呀！辗呀！忙了一整天。别的倒好说，就是底架大梁有点费事。没有三角铁，我们是用厂里的厚铁板折成的。原来预计有二百五十厘米高就够了，谁知道搭不上架，卡不着轴轮。又跑到车站量了尺寸，加高了一百五十厘米才算解决了。
    小火车制成了，这个喜讯立刻轰动了全厂。当天下午就决定试车。我们点燃了炉火，铺了长长一段轨道，郭司机坐在驾驶棚里，我们看到自己制造的小火车，就要开动了，心里那个高兴劲真是说不出来。这家伙唦唦的放了点汽就走动了。谁知没走几步，就停下了。我们只得用铁撬来帮忙，就这样转半轮停一下，没走几步又不动了。我们的心立刻就凉下来了。怎么回事呢？！一时找不出毛病，老孙急的满头大汗，我也气的几乎掉下泪。这时党委书记走到我们面前，温和地说：“能走这么远就不坏，头次试验罗！今天休息吧，明天再琢磨琢磨。”
    当晚我一夜也没有睡着，翻来复去地想，猛的想到毛病可能在汽箱里。我立刻跳起来，叫醒了老孙。这时天也快亮了。我们打开汽箱，也找不出哪有毛病。郭司机说拐背短了，我们就把拐背辗长十五厘米，结果还是不顶事。就这样揣摸了两天，毛病总算找到了。原来拐背和拉杆的角度小，轮转的辐度不大，这就使汽门给汽不及时。我们动手移动了拐背，放大了角度，再一试验，满好。小火车在土铁轨上一喘一喘的平稳的走着，前进后退都很灵便，这下全厂立刻又活动起来了。那天是9月28日，大后天就是国庆节，我们提前两天完成了任务。
