    Communes Undertake Water Conservancy: Many People, Great Strength
    Shanxi Starts Constructing Over Ninety Large and Medium-Sized Water Conservancy Projects

    (Our dispatch from Taiyuan, January 10th) The rural people's communes of Shanxi Province have demonstrated tremendous superiority in the winter farmland water conservancy capital construction campaign. While undertaking various small-scale water conservancy projects, communes in various regions have begun to construct large and medium-sized water conservancy projects to harness and utilize floodwaters in a planned and methodical manner.

    Currently, construction has commenced on ninety-three large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in various regions, and preparatory work is being accelerated for some other projects. Apart from a few key large-scale projects directly led by the water conservancy departments with state investment and mobilizing commune labor for construction, the vast majority of projects are being constructed by communes or joint communes. The scale is grand, with general dam heights of twenty-five meters and storage capacities of over ten million cubic meters. Some projects have dam heights of sixty meters and storage capacities of hundreds of millions of cubic meters. These are all projects of great importance for developing production and changing the natural landscape. For example, the largest water conservancy project, the Fen River Reservoir, upon completion, can control the floodwaters of the Fen River's upstream drainage area of over five thousand three hundred square kilometers and transform them into clear water; ensure the safety of factories, mines, and villages in the middle and lower reaches; irrigate one million five hundred thousand mu of farmland in the Jinzhong area; and intercept twenty-three million tons of silt each year, preventing it from flowing into the Yellow River, directly protecting the Sanmenxia Yellow River key project; and also supply industrial water and generate hydroelectric power. Although farmers have long yearned for the construction of these projects, the past scattered, small agricultural cooperatives were unable to undertake them due to limitations in labor, capital, and technical strength. The realization of people's communes in the province's rural areas last September created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for unified planning of mountain and river basins and carrying out centralized, comprehensive management. Seventy percent of Shanxi Province is mountainous, with many rivers. In the past, high-lying cultivated land was threatened by drought, suffering lean harvests in nine out of ten years. On the other hand, river water at lower elevations flowed away unused, and whenever mountain floods erupted, they caused disasters. After cooperativization, agricultural cooperatives carried out many soil and water conservation projects, but they lacked unified planning, or the lower reaches were managed while the upper reaches were not, or measures were single and projects were scattered, resulting in slow progress. During the great leap forward in agriculture last year, some regions' agricultural cooperatives jointly constructed some larger projects, but problems such as land occupation, investment, and benefits were difficult to resolve. After being merged into a single commune for unified planning, these problems were easily solved. In the Taihang Mountains, Songxi River in Xiyang County (now merged into the suburbs of Yangquan City) runs across the entire territory, and flooding often affected agricultural production and endangered the safety of people and livestock. In previous years, unified planning and comprehensive management were not possible, and farmers along the river built protective works every year and suffered disasters every year. After the establishment of a commune for the entire county, the commune quickly established a project headquarters to uniformly plan projects and take unified action. In addition to carrying out a large amount of soil and water conservation work, a portion of the labor force was drawn to construct two large reservoirs. This harmful river, which had plagued the people for thousands of years, began to benefit the people. Such a large project would have been difficult to construct in the past.

    The communes' funds and property are more substantial than those of the agricultural cooperatives, with a greater investment capacity. At the same time, the scope of material allocation is large, which can both accumulate small amounts into large amounts and allow mutual exchange. After the construction of the Guan River Reservoir in Wuxiang County began, the quantities of cement, explosives, flatbed carts, and machinery required for the project were insufficient, and relying on external supply could not solve the problem. Later, it was decided to set up factories at the construction site, with each commune supporting whatever it had. As a result, they combined scattered resources and built ten comprehensive factories serving the project from scratch on a bare site, including cement, explosives, gypsum, vehicle repair, ball bearings, power generation, and weaving. In half a month, they produced more than one thousand eight hundred new products needed for construction. The establishment of factories greatly promoted the construction speed, saved labor and capital, and especially overcame the difficulty of a shortage of materials and equipment. Now the factories serve the project, and after the project is completed, the factories can serve the commune, making them a commune industrial base. Therefore, communes in various regions are developing commune industries while constructing large and small water conservancy projects.

    公社办水利  人多力量大
    山西动手修建九十多处大中型水利
    本报太原10日电　山西省农村人民公社在冬季农田水利基本建设运动中显示了巨大的优越性。各地公社在兴修各种小型水利工程的同时，开始有计划有步骤地兴建驯服、利用暴洪水害的大、中型水利工程。
    目前，各地已经动工的大、中型水利工程已有九十三项，还有一部分工程正在加紧进行施工准备工作。这些工程除一些重点大工程由水利部门直接领导、国家投资，调动公社劳力施工外，绝大部分工程由公社或公社联合兴建。规模都很宏伟，一般的坝高二十五公尺、蓄水量一千万公方以上，有的工程坝高六十公尺，蓄水量多至数亿公方，都是对发展生产、改变自然面貌关系重大的工程，如最大的水利工程——汾河水库，仅这一项工程竣工后可以把汾河上游五千三百多平方公里流域面积的洪水控制起来，变成清水；能够保证中、下游工厂、矿山、村庄安全；灌溉晋中地区一百五十万亩耕地；每年可拦蓄住二千三百万吨泥沙，不流入黄河，对三门峡黄河枢纽工程直接起保护作用；还能供应工业用水和进行水力发电。修建这些工程虽然农民渴望已久，但是过去分散、小型的农业社无论在劳力上、资金上和技术力量方面，都难以胜任。去年9月间全省农村实现人民公社化，就为统一规划山河流域，进行集中、综合治理创造了过去未有的优越条件。山西省70％的地区是山区，河流很多，过去长期是地势高的耕地受旱灾威胁，十年九歉，而另一方面是低处任河水白白流走不能利用，每当山洪暴发时还要泛滥成灾。合作化以后农业社虽进行了许多水土保持工程，但是缺乏统一规划，或下治上不治，或措施单一工程分散，收效缓慢。去年农业大跃进中有些地区农业社联合修建了一些较大工程，占地、投资、受益等问题也难以处理。经过合成一个公社统一规划后，这些问题都迎刃而解。太行山区昔阳县（现并入阳泉市郊）松溪河横贯全境，雨季经常泛滥影响农业生产和危害人畜安全。前几年不能统一规划综合治理，沿河农民年年修防护工程年年受灾，全县建立一个公社后，公社很快成立了工程指挥部统一规划工程、统一行动，除大量进行保持水土工作，并抽调了一部分劳力兴修两个大水库。这个千百年来危害人民的害河，开始为人民造福。这样大的工程过去是难以修建的。
    公社资金财产比农业社雄厚，投资能力较大，同时调剂物资的范围大，既能积少为多，又能互通有无。武乡县关河水库开工以后，工程需要的水泥、炸药、小平车、机具等品种数量都不够，靠外地供应得不到解决，后来决定工地办工厂，各公社有啥支援啥，结果化零为整，在一无所有的工地上，白手起家，建起为工程服务的水泥、炸药、石膏、车辆修造、滚珠、发电、编织等十个综合性的工厂，半个月就造出一千八百多种施工需要的新产品。办起工厂以后大大促进了施工速度，节省了劳力、资金，特别是突破了物资器材缺乏难关。现在工厂为工程服务，工程结束后工厂便可为公社服务，使它成为公社工业基地。因此，各地公社在兴建大、小型水利工程的同时，也发展了公社工业。
