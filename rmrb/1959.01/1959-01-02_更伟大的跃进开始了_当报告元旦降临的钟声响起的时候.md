A Greater Leap Forward Begins
When the Chimes Announcing New Year's Day Sound...
Our Staff Reporter

Strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward! This is the fighting banner raised high by the people of the capital as they enter 1959.

Heroes are Numerous Before Tiananmen
Red palace lanterns hung from the Tiananmen Gate tower, and a row of red flags fluttered in the wind. On both sides of the square, many newly erected scaffolding rose from the ground into the sky. Thousands of lights illuminated the construction site. Workers shuttled back and forth on the scaffolding, and below, there was a constant flow of traffic. Concrete workers pushing small carts continuously emitted heat from their heads. After work, the workers wrote poems praising their labor: "On New Year's Eve, the stars fill the sky, ten thousand lights shine brightly, the stars are countless, and the heroes on the construction site are like stars." At midnight, concrete workers carried a banner that read "Welcome the New Leap Forward Year, Create Greater Achievements" to take over the shift. The construction workers coming off duty flocked to the club to hold a New Year's party.

Fighting for 18 Million Tons
At the Capital Steel Base—Shigang—beneath Shijingshan, steel flowers splashed in the converter workshop, and the flames from the blast furnace group reddened the sky. On the construction site of the expanding iron and steel complex, scaffolding and derricks tens of feet high were faintly visible in the rolling smoke. Groups of steelworkers, busy taking over the midnight shift on New Year's Day, stamped their determination to "Fight to Seize 18 Million Tons of Steel" on a large-character poster that read "Seize 10.7 Million Tons of Steel." At 0:30, the flames from Converter No. 7 became increasingly bright. Zhang Jinghai, the first steelmaking hand and a young worker, nervously observed the rolling molten steel through blue-light goggles. When the molten steel was ready, he shouted, "Good!" At this moment, the furnace tilted forward, spewing out the first furnace of steel in 1959. These workers, who had once created a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in nine minutes and forty seconds and blowing eighty-two furnaces continuously, told reporters that they were determined to press ahead in the new year and break last year's records. Their goal is: "Rank first among the three steel mills (Shigang, Beijing Steel Plant, and Special Steel Plant) in 1958, and win the national red flag in 1959."

Miners Busy Underground
At the Chengzi Coal Mine on the banks of the Yongding River, leaders and technicians from various departments held a meeting to inspect the mine's holiday maintenance and arrange the production operation plan for January. Meng Jingfu, the deputy director of the mine, directed the battles of the ground and underground workers in the dispatch room. The locker room was brightly lit, and workers going down and coming up the mine were constantly passing by. The last shift of coal miners in 1958 brought good news from the mine to the workers participating in the evening party: the annual coal output was 660,000 tons, exceeding the mine's annual leap forward plan, which had been raised five times. At midnight, the reporter came to the mine, nearly two hundred meters deep underground, to visit the miners who were fighting. In the No. 2 slot roadway, eight excavation workers, who had once created a record of advancing 201.6 meters of rock per month, were using the fastest speed to split through fifty meters of rock to speed up the passage of coal cars. At 2:30 a.m., the blaster twisted the blasting machine, and forty-two blastholes continuously made a loud rumbling sound. The miners cheered for successfully firing the first batch of explosives this year. Advanced producer Zhao Yushu told reporters: In the past year, Chinese miners have left the UK far behind in terms of coal production. This year, we must muster greater efforts to produce more coal to support the country's construction and the people's livelihood needs.

Both Work and Leisure
Next to the famous Ming Tombs Reservoir, members of the fourth production team of the Changling Work Station of the Ming Tombs People's Commune, after completing the last work of 1958, took fragrant meals from the public canteen and returned to their newly built homes to hold family meals. Commune member Yu Jingquan said: "Before liberation, we worried about eating and drinking to avoid debt during the New Year, but now we will never have to worry about it again." In the team headquarters, team leader Cheng Guoxun and Shen Bingzhen, the deputy leader of the second production team who had just returned from the district labor model meeting, were studying the team's 1959 grain production plan. They planned to implement the basic farmland system of "less planting, high yield, and more harvesting," using some of the land for growing grain to plant grass and fruit trees to increase sideline income. In the evening, Cheng Guoxun and eight commune members discussed the issue of winter sideline production, planning to cut four hundred catties of grass per person per day. At this time, the club was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and the music of musical instruments. The actors of the amateur troupe were rehearsing Peking opera and Ping opera.

Firing the First Shot
Thousands upon thousands of builders of the Miyun Reservoir, surrounded by mountains, entered 1959 with excitement, tension, and order. The sound of train whistles and the crushing sound of tractors shook the entire valley and the earth. At midnight, a train full of sand and gravel arrived at the top of the dam. Xu Fenglin, the instructor of the Hebei Jixian militia rocket company, an advanced producer responsible for unloading the train, shouted to everyone: "Comrades, fire the first shot of 1959!" The militiamen immediately swarmed up, unloading the fifty-ton load of sand and gravel in just ten minutes, three minutes faster than usual. A person holding a stopwatch recorded the new speed created by the company in the New Year. In the work shed, militiamen from the Hongqi Commune in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, who were taking turns to rest, were receiving socks, towels, cabbage, and rice straw sent by their commune on the eve of the New Year. Some militiamen also received their wages sent by their commune on this day. The militiamen taking turns to rest also held dragon lantern shows, stilt walks, and danced the yangko to celebrate the New Year's Eve. Some districts and counties also held New Year's greetings. The Communist Youth League organization of the Zoumazhuang Deputy Dam construction site announced the admission of twenty-two outstanding young shock team members into the Communist Youth League at midnight today.

Be a Red Flag That Never Fades
Sharing the New Year with the people of the capital were also a group of the most respected guests, the outstanding representatives of the 500 million heroic farmers attending the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. As time stepped into a greater year, "leap forward" and "re-leap forward" became the focus of their conversations. Zhang Qiuxiang, a national agricultural labor model who was hired as a special researcher by the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke vibrantly about her new plan to plant ten mu of cotton "experimental fields" this year. She is determined to continue to strengthen the research on cotton "experimental fields," strive to learn advanced experience, and help others with all her experience, to be "a red flag that never fades." When the representatives talked about China's wheat production exceeding that of the United States in 1958, everyone rubbed their fists and palms, preparing to immediately join the new battle after the successful conclusion of the conference, determined to create more high-yield records and surpass capitalist countries in more areas.

Flowers Bloom Facing the Morning Sun
On the stage of a hall at Peking University, a magnificent picture appeared: the East is red, and a flower symbolizing the combination of education and productive labor is blooming towards the morning sun. It shows that the new year has begun! Nearly ten thousand teachers and students under the stage immediately cheered, hugged each other, and wished each other a happy new year. The songs and dances of "The East is Red" and "Socialism is Good" were sung in harmony, and joyful passion filled the hall.

Before this, teachers and students had held small New Year's Eve parties separately. Teachers and students from the Department of Geology and Geography who had just returned from finding minerals in the mountains exchanged their harvests in the field practice in the evening. Teachers and students from the Department of Chemistry who had victoriously returned to school after smelting steel in the countryside enjoyed literary and artistic programs written, directed, and performed by themselves, reflecting their three months of labor life. The fourth-year students of the Chinese Department, who won the title of National Advanced Unit for Youth Socialist Construction, are determined to contribute even more brilliant achievements in the new year than the "History of Chinese Literature" they compiled in 1958. Now, many of them are dressed as geological pioneers, steel workers, and other labor images, holding their scientific research results and the leap forward indicators for 1959, singing and dancing, and reveling in the hall.

Double Leap Forward in Thought and Art
The Beijing People's Art Theater was filled with laughter, and the entire staff was holding a farewell and welcoming New Year's party. Everyone performed programs praising the Great Leap Forward for a while, and danced gracefully for a while. The actors who had just returned from labor training in the countryside sang folk songs and clapper talks they had compiled based on rural life. Although they were not wearing peasant costumes tonight, their singing was bold, their faces were radiant, and they had the heroic style of peasants, sweeping away the delicate and soft air of intellectuals. The banners, certificates, and congratulatory letters hanging around the hall are witnesses to the hard work of the theater staff over the past year. But people are not satisfied with this. They raised their glasses to congratulate: this year, we must make creative works and performances more fruitful, and make another leap forward in thought and art. The theater has decided to further revise the drama "Burning Red Heart," which has been performed for more than three months with full houses, to more truthfully and artistically reflect the thoughts and personalities of the heroic characters in the play. During the party, many leaders from the literary and art circles also came to enjoy themselves with the actors. Writers, actors, and directors enthusiastically talked about their creative and performance plans for 1959. People congratulated Comrade Guo Moruo on his glorious joining of the Communist Party of China. When this old and vigorous scientist and writer talked to reporters, he enthusiastically praised the great victory of the Party's mass line in the field of science and culture over the past year. He said that in the new year, he must do his best to make greater contributions to the scientific and cultural undertakings of the Party and the people.

The Advice of "Old Man New Year"
In the Children's Palace in Jingshan Park, more than six hundred children were dancing and dancing around the spruce tree. At this time, an Old Man New Year wearing a scarlet robe, along with a group of guests—Steel Marshal, Grain Marshal, Machinery Marshal, Coal Pioneer, Electricity Pioneer, Wheat King, Rice King, Cabbage Girl, and Cotton Sister-in-law appeared on the stage and joined the dance circles under the stage. These guests were all "high-yield satellites," who were fat and tall, and it was very inconvenient to move around. The children wearing flower crowns held their hands and waists and danced the Leap Forward Dance together. It was late at night, and when the Old Man New Year and the guests bid farewell to the children by dragon boat, the Old Man New Year said: "1959 is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country. We should strive for a greater leap forward. Let's see who has achieved better results next year."

Heading Towards a New Milestone
At the time when people were singing and dancing to celebrate the New Year, the Fengtai Railway Station was a scene of intense labor. More than five hundred railway workers were fighting in the cold winter night. Looking out from the signal station, the tall lighthouse illuminated the entire station, and red, green, yellow, and white signal lights were flashing on dozens of dense lines; trains of freight cars spewed thick smoke, "Woo—woo" roaring and speeding past. This station is an important hub of China's railway transportation. In the twenty-four hours from 18:00 on New Year's Eve to 18:00 on New Year's Day, the number of freight cars passing through here increased by about 40% compared with the same period last year. These freight cars were loaded with steel and machines from the Northeast, logs from the Greater Khingan Mountains, coal from Jingxing, ore from Baoding, and cotton cloth from Tianjin. "1959 is a year of greater leap forward," people here have received a clear confirmation. When the staff of the station chatted with reporters about these situations, the roaring whistle announced that the time had entered 1959, and trains of freight cars passed through here again, heading towards a new milestone of socialism.

    更伟大的跃进开始了
    当报告元旦降临的钟声响起的时候……
    本报记者
    为实现更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！这是首都人民进入1959年时高举着的一面战斗的旗帜。
    天安门前英雄多
    天安门城楼上悬挂着大红宫灯，一排红旗迎风招展。在广场两侧，新搭起的许多脚手架从平地升入高空。万盏灯光把工地照得通明。脚手架上工人们往来如梭，架下车水马龙，推着小车的混凝土工人头上不断冒着热气。歇工后，工人们写诗歌颂自己的劳动：“除夕夜晚繁星天，万盏灯火一片明，繁星点点难尽数，工地英雄似繁星。”午夜，混凝土工人抬着“迎接新的跃进年，创造更大成绩”的标语牌前来换班。下班的建筑工人们，又涌到俱乐部里举行迎新晚会。
    为一八○○而战
    在石景山下的首都钢铁基地——石钢，转炉车间里钢花飞溅，高炉群中闪出的火光映红了天空。正在扩建的钢铁联合企业的工地上，数十丈高的脚手架和大抱杆在滚滚的浓烟中时隐时现。一群群忙着接元旦零点班的钢铁工人，把当晚写下“为夺一八○○万吨钢而战”的决心书，盖在“夺下一○七○万吨钢”的大字报上，零点三十分钟，七号转炉喷出的火焰愈来愈明亮，第一炼钢手、青年工人张景海带着蓝光镜紧张地观察翻滚的钢水。当钢水吹炼成熟的时候，他放开嗓子喊：“好！”这时，炉口向前倾斜，吐出了1959年的第一炉钢水。这些曾经创造九分四十秒炼一炉钢和一个炉连续吹炼八十二炉新纪录的工人们对记者说，他们决心在新的一年里乘胜直追，刷新去年的纪录。他们的目标是：“1958年列三钢（石钢和北京钢厂、特殊钢厂）第一，1959年夺全国红旗”。
    井下矿工忙
    在永定河畔的城子煤矿，各部门领导人和技术人员开会检查全矿的节日检修和安排1月份生产作业计划。副矿长孟景福在调度室里，指挥地面和井下职工们的战斗。更衣室灯火通明，上井下井的工人川流不息。1958年最后一班采煤工人，从井下给参加晚会的职工们带来了捷报：全年产煤六十六万吨，超额完成了这个矿五次提高过的年度跃进计划。午夜的时候，记者来到离地面近二百公尺深的井下，访问正在战斗着的矿工们。在二槽巷道里，曾经创造岩石月进二百零一点六公尺最高纪录的八个采掘工人，正在用最快的速度劈通五十公尺长的岩石，好加快煤车的通过速度。凌晨二点三十分，放炮员扭动放炮器，四十二个炮眼连续发出轰轰巨响。矿工们为顺利打响今年第一批排炮而欢呼起来。先进生产者赵玉书对记者说：过去的一年，我们中国矿工在煤的产量方面，把英国远远的甩在后边。今年，我们要鼓足更大的干劲，争取生产更多的煤，支援祖国建设和人民的生活需要。
    有劳又有逸
    在著名的十三陵水库旁边，十三陵人民公社长陵工作站第四生产大队的社员们，在做完1958年最后一工后，从公共食堂打回香喷喷的饭菜，各自回到新建的住宅里举行合家餐。公社社员于景泉老大爷说：“解放前过年躲债愁吃喝，如今永远甭操这份心了。”在大队部里，大队长程国勋和刚从区里开完劳模会回来的第二生产队副队长申丙珍正在研究全队1959年粮食丰产规划。他们准备执行“少种、高产、多收”的基本农田制，以一部分种粮食的土地种草和果树，以增加副业收入。晚上，程国勋又和八个社员研究了冬季副业生产的问题，计划每人每天打草四百斤。这时，俱乐部里锣鼓喧天，琴声动听，业余剧团的演员正在排演京剧和评剧。
    打响第一炮
    密云水库成千上万的建设者，在群山环抱中，怀着振奋的心情，紧张而有秩序地进入了1959年。火车的汽笛声和拖拉机的碾压声振动着整个山谷和大地。在子夜时，一列满载着沙石的火车开到坝顶。负责火车卸料任务的河北省蓟县的民工火箭连指导员、先进生产者徐凤林向大家高呼：“同志们，打响1959年的第一炮！”民工们立即蜂涌而上，只用十分钟，就把载重五十吨的沙石卸完了，比平时缩短了三分钟。一位手执跑表的人，记录下了这个连在新年创造的新速度。在工棚里，轮班休息的河北省宁河县的红旗公社的民工们，正在接受他们公社在新年前夕送来的袜子、毛巾、白菜和稻草。还有些民工在这天收到了他们公社送来的工资。轮班休息的民工们，还举行了龙灯会、高跷会和跳起秧歌舞来欢度除夕。有的区、县民工还举行了团拜。走马庄副坝工地的共青团组织，在今天零点宣布了二十二名优秀青年突击队队员为共青团员。
    做一面永不褪色的红旗
    和首都人民共度新年的，还有一批最受人尊敬的客人，他们是参加全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的五亿英雄农民的优秀代表。当时间跨进更伟大的一年的时刻，“跃进”
  “再跃进”成了他们谈话的中心。被中国科学院陕西分院聘请为特约研究员的全国农业劳动模范张秋香神采奕奕地谈她今年要种十亩棉花“试验田”的新计划。她决心继续加强棉花“试验田”的研究，努力学习先进经验，并以自己的全部经验帮助别人，做“一面永不褪色的红旗”。代表们在谈到1958年我国小麦产量超过美国时，个个磨拳擦掌，准备在大会胜利闭幕后，立即投入新的战斗，决心创造更多的高产纪录，在更多的方面压倒资本主义国家。
    鲜花迎着朝霞开放
    在北京大学一个大厅的舞台上，出现了一幅宏伟的图景：东方红了，一朵象征着教育与生产劳动相结合的鲜花正迎着朝霞开放。它表明：新的一年开始了！台下近万名师生，立刻纵情欢呼起来，互相拥抱，互祝新年。“东方红”、“社会主义好”的歌舞一唱百和，欢乐的激情充满了大厅。
    在这以前，师生们就分别举行过小型的除夕晚会。刚从丛山峻岭找矿归来的地质地理系师生们，在晚上交谈着在野外实习中得到的丰收。下乡炼钢胜利返校的化学系师生们欣赏着自编、自演，反映他们三个月劳动生活的文娱节目。获得全国青年社会主义建设先进单位的中文系四年级学生们，决心争取在新的一年中贡献出比1958年编著的“中国文学史”更辉煌的成绩来。现在，他们很多人化装成地质尖兵、钢铁工人等劳动者的形象，拿着他们科学研究的成果和1959年跃进的指标，载歌载舞，在大厅里尽情地狂欢。
    思想艺术双跃进
    北京人民艺术剧院笑声盈耳，全院人员正在举行辞岁迎新的联欢会。大家一会儿表演歌颂大跃进的节目，一会儿翩翩起舞。刚从农村劳动锻炼回来的演员们演唱了他们根据农村生活编成的民歌和快板。他们今晚虽然没穿农民装，但是歌声豪爽，满面红光，很有农民的豪迈风格，一扫知识分子的娇声柔气。大厅四周悬挂着的一幅幅锦旗、奖状和贺信，是这个剧院人员一年来辛勤劳动的见证。可是人们并不因此而满足，他们举杯祝贺：今年要使创作、演出更丰收，思想、艺术再跃进。这个剧院已经决定进一步修改连演三个多月场场客满的话剧“烈火红心”，使它更真实、更艺术地反映剧中那些英雄人物的思想和性格。在联欢过程中，许多文艺界的领导人也来和演员们同乐。作家、演员、导演们兴致勃勃地谈论着他们1959年的创作、演出计划。人们祝贺郭沫若同志光荣地加入中国共产党。这位老当益壮的科学家、文学家同记者交谈时，热情地歌颂了一年来党的群众路线在科学文化领域中的伟大胜利。他说，他在新的一年里，一定要竭尽全力为党和人民的科学文化事业做出更大的贡献。
   “新年老人”的嘱咐
    在景山公园的少年宫里，六百多个孩子围着枞树跳着，舞着。这时，一位穿着猩红长袍的新年老人，带着一批客人——钢元帅、粮元帅、机械元帅，煤先行官、电先行官、小麦王、水稻王、白菜姑娘、棉花嫂嫂出现在舞台上，并且参加到台下各个舞圈里。这些客人们都是“高产卫星”，长得又胖又高，走动很不方便，戴着花冠的小朋友们挽着他们的手和腰，一起跳了跃进舞。夜深了，当新年老人和客人们乘着龙舟向孩子们告别时，新年老人说：“1959年是建国十周年，应该争取更大的跃进，明年的今天，让我们再来看谁的成绩更好。”
    奔向新的里程
    在人们载歌载舞欢度新年的时刻，丰台火车站上是一片紧张的劳动景象。五百多名铁路职工在严寒的冬夜里战斗着。从信号站上远远望去，高高的灯塔照亮了整个车站，数十条密集的线路上红、绿、黄、白的信号灯在闪闪发亮；一列列的货车喷吐着浓烟，“呜—呜”地吼叫着飞奔而过。这个车站是我国铁路交通的一个重要枢纽。在除夕十八时到元旦十八时的二十四小时内，从这里通过的货车，比去年同期增长40％左右。这些货车上满载着东北的钢材和机器，大兴安岭的原木，井陉的煤，保定的矿石和天津的棉布。“1959年是个更大的跃进年”，人们在这里得到了鲜明的印证。当车站的工作人员同记者畅谈这些情况时，怒吼着的汽笛声宣布时间已进入1959年，一列列的货车又经过这儿奔向社会主义的新的里程。
