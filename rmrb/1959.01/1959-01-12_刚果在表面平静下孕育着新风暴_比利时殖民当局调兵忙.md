    Congo Brews a New Storm Beneath the Surface Calm
    Belgian Colonial Authorities Busy Deploying Troops
    Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 11th - The city of Leopoldville is superficially calm for the last two days under the brutal suppression of the Belgian colonial authorities. However, the colonial authorities are still stationing troops at the boundary between the African and European residential areas, ready to suppress any new resistance actions at any time. Colonial military patrols are still walking back and forth on the streets day and night.
    Belgian authorities are continuing to deploy troops to Congo to reinforce the local colonial army. According to reports, three planes carrying Belgian paratroopers took off from Brussels yesterday to the Kamina military base in Lower Katanga, Belgian Congo. In addition, another batch of paratroopers is scheduled to fly to Lisbon this morning, preparing to transfer to ships there to go to Belgian Congo. There are also reports that a group of Belgian troops who recently completed their military training in the Congo and are on their way home have also been ordered to return to the Congo to reinforce.
    Several hundred colonialists in this city held a meeting on the evening of the 9th, openly clamoring that the connection between Belgium and the Congo is "permanent and indivisible." They also clamored for the establishment of an "armed self-defense force" of colonialists, and demanded that "severe sanctions" be imposed on Africans who participated in this action against colonial rule.

    刚果在表面平静下孕育着新风暴
    比利时殖民当局调兵忙
    新华社11日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在比利时殖民当局的残酷镇压下，这两天利奥波德维尔市内表面上是平静的。但是殖民当局仍然把军队驻扎在非洲人居住区同白人居住区交界的地方，准备随时镇压新的反抗行动。殖民军巡逻队仍然日夜在大街上走来走去。
    比利时当局正在继续调兵前往刚果增援当地的殖民军队。据报道，昨日一天内有三架载有比利时伞兵的飞机从布鲁塞尔起飞前往比属刚果境内下加丹加的加米纳军事基地。另外还有一批伞兵部队定今天上午乘飞机赴里斯本，准备从那里换乘轮船去比属刚果。还有消息说，一批最近刚结束了在刚果的军事训练、正在回国途中的比利时军队也奉命转回刚果去增援。
    这个城市里的数百名殖民主义分子9日晚上举行集会，公开叫嚣比利时同刚果之间的联系是“永久的、不可分割的”。他们还叫嚷要成立一支殖民主义者的“武装自卫队”，并要求对参与这次反抗殖民统治行动的非洲人施以“严厉制裁”。
