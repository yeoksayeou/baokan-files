Connecting Canals and Reservoirs Transforms Arid Mountain Areas into "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall"
Southern Ningxia Vigorously Develops Water Conservancy to Create Conditions for Transforming Cultivation into Gardening

(Our report) The water conservancy construction army of 100,000 Hui and Han people in the arid mountainous area of southern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, with the heroic spirit of splitting mountains and filling gullies, braving the cold and digging frozen soil, is launching a high tide of water conservancy construction centered on comprehensive utilization of mountain reservoirs. In this mountainous area, the planning and construction of large and medium-sized mountain reservoirs is underway, with ten already under construction, two completed, and more than ten reservoirs actively preparing for construction. After these reservoir projects are completed next year, they will change the face of the poor mountains and bad waters in southern Ningxia and ensure the implementation of basic farmland systems in arid mountainous areas.

The arid mountainous area of southern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, located in the gully area of the Northwest Loess Plateau, includes Guyuan Special District and Tongxin, Yanchi, and other counties. The area has few rivers and many mountains, large mountains and deep gullies, severe soil erosion, and a lack of water sources, all of which make it a water-stressed area. The average annual rainfall here is only 250 mm to 300 mm, and most of it is concentrated in the autumn. Therefore, water storage and irrigation have become the main ways to develop water conservancy and increase grain production. Surveying began before and after the establishment of the autonomous region. The Guyuan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in leading the masses to carry out the water conservancy construction movement, proposed to take water as the key, with the construction of comprehensively utilized mountain reservoirs as the main focus, to treat the three rivers together (Hulu River, Jing River, and Qingshui River), to grasp the three waters together (sky water, surface water, and groundwater), and to accelerate the change of the mountainous area.

After the construction of these more than 20 mountain reservoir projects that have already been built or are about to be started, the water storage capacity can reach 820 million cubic meters, which can expand the irrigation area by 3.28 million mu and generate more than 9,000 kilowatts of electricity. The dams of the ten reservoir projects currently under construction are generally dozens of meters high. The largest, such as Zhangjiawan, Shixiakou, Sikouzi, and Xianma River reservoirs, have earth dams as high as 47 meters to 58 meters, higher than the dam of the Guanting Reservoir. The water storage capacity of Zhangjiawan Reservoir can reach 140 million cubic meters, more than twice the water storage capacity of the Ming Tombs Reservoir.

The construction of these large and medium-sized reservoirs in arid mountainous areas can not only form an irrigation network with interconnected canals and reservoirs and artificial lakes dotted around the mountains, achieving an average of three mu of insured water land per person with 500 cubic meters of water per mu. At the same time, the establishment of small hydropower stations using reservoirs will accelerate the industrialization, agricultural factoryization, and gardening of cultivation in the mountainous area people's communes. In addition, it can also be combined with soil and water conservation in the mountainous area to store water and conserve soil, change the climate, and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, turning the arid mountainous area into a rich, beautiful, and happy mountainous area. This will make the arid mountainous area in the southern part of the autonomous region comparable to the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall" in the Yellow River irrigation area in the northern part of the autonomous region.

Since November of last year, the water conservancy construction army composed of Hui and Han people has been constantly increasing. People have broken the conventional practice that large-scale water conservancy projects cannot be constructed in winter, and carried out winter construction in the ice and snow. The Hui and Han people issued heroic declarations: "Not afraid of high mountains and far distances, difficulties cannot stop the heroes, stepping over high mountains and turning over the sky, we must do it even in wind and snow!" Many Hui and Han women came to the construction site from hundreds of miles away and launched labor competitions with the men. The women's combat company composed of 105 Hui and Han women in the Huangjiachuan Reservoir in Xiji County created a record of completing an average of more than four cubic meters of earthwork per person per day after entering the construction site, which is one to several times higher than the average efficiency. On each construction site, the Hui and Han people demonstrated the spirit of close unity and communism, supporting each other and working together to overcome various difficulties. More than 1,000 Han commune members from the Yuwang District of Tongxin County traveled 300 miles to the Shixiakou Reservoir in Haiyuan County to support the local Hui commune members in building the reservoir.

In the construction of the reservoirs, the Hui and Han people also demonstrated the spirit of hard work and ingenuity. Since some reservoirs are in seismic zones, in order to ensure the quality of the earth dam of the reservoir, they created a method of building earth dams with a mixture of various soil types such as red clay, "geshi" soil [Translator's note: a type of gravelly soil], and loess, making the earth dam strong and stable. Now, dozens of new tools such as high-line soil transport, wooden rail and iron rail dump trucks, ice sled soil transport, and wooden sheep-foot rollers have been created on the construction site, and the work efficiency has increased by several to dozens of times compared with carrying by shoulders and backs. Some construction sites have basically eliminated the phenomenon of carrying by shoulders and backs, and have achieved "flying in the air" and "pushing on the ground" for soil transportation. In the Zhangjiawan Reservoir in Tongxin County, in the absence of mechanical equipment, the masses created a wooden winch that can cold-draw steel bars with a diameter of 12 mm, increasing the steel bar stress by 6% and reducing the two processes of rust removal and straightening. By using this method, each reservoir can save 60 tons of steel this year. The Sikouzi Reservoir in Guyuan County, after many experiments, took materials locally and successfully manufactured No. 200 cement using clay, solving the difficulty of 3,000 tons of cement required for the project, saving the state more than 60,000 yuan.

    渠库相连变干旱山区为“塞上江南”
    宁夏南部大办水利为实现耕作园田化创造条件
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区南部干旱山区，十万回汉族人民组成的水利建设大军，正以劈山填沟，气势磅礴的英雄气概，冒着风寒，掘开冻土，掀起兴修以综合利用的山地水库为中心的水利建设高潮。在这个山区规划兴修大、中型山地蓄水库，目前已经有十个开工，两个完工，还有十多座水库，也正在积极准备施工。这些水库工程在明年全部完工后，将改变宁夏南部穷山恶水的面貌，保证干旱山区实行基本农田制。
    宁夏回族自治区南部干旱山区，位于西北黄土高原沟壑区，包括固原专区和同心、盐池等县，境内川少山多，山大沟深，水土冲刷严重，水源缺乏，都是苦水区。这里平均每年降雨量只有二百五十公厘到三百公厘，并大部分集中在秋季，因此蓄水灌溉就成为发展水利增产粮食的主要途径。自治区成立前后，就开始进行勘测。中共固原地委，在领导群众兴修水利运动中，提出以水为纲，以兴修综合利用的山区水库为主，三河齐治（葫芦河、泾河、清水河）、三水齐抓（天上水、地面水、地下水），加速改变山区面貌。
    目前已经兴修和即将动工的这二十多座山区水库修成后可蓄水八亿二千万方，可以扩大灌溉面积三百二十八万亩，发电九千瓩以上。目前正在兴修的十个水库工程，坝高一般都在几十公尺，其中最大的如张家湾、石峡口、寺口子、苋麻河等水库，拦洪土坝高达四十七公尺到五十八公尺，比官厅水库的拦水坝还高。张家湾蓄水库蓄水量可达一亿四千万方，比十三陵水库的蓄水量多一倍多。
    在干旱山区兴修这些大、中型蓄水库工程，不仅可以在山区形成渠、库相连的灌溉网和星罗棋布的人工湖，达到平均每人有每亩给水五百方的保险水地三亩。同时，利用水库建立小型水电站将加速山区人民公社的工业化，农业工厂化，耕作田园化的实现。另外，还可结合山区的水土保持蓄水保土，改变气候，发展林业、牧业、副业和渔业，把干旱山区建设成一个富饶美丽幸福的山区。这样可使自治区南部的干旱山区与自治区北部引黄灌区的“塞上江南”相齐并类。
    从去年11月份开始，回汉族人民组成的水利建设大军就不断增加。人们破除过去在冬季大型水利工程不能施工的常规，在冰天雪地中进行冬季施工。回汉族人民发出“不怕高山远，困难挡不住英雄汉，踏过高山翻过天，刮风下雪也要干”的英雄豪语。有很多回汉族妇女，从几百里路以外来到工地，和男人们一起展开劳动竞赛。西吉县黄家川水库一百零五个回汉族妇女组成的妇女战斗连，进工地以后，连战连捷创造出平均每天每人完成土方四方多的纪录，比一般效率提高一倍到几倍。各个工地上，回汉人民发挥了亲密团结的共产主义精神，互相支援，同心协力，战胜各种困难。同心县预旺区千余个汉族社员，远征三百里到海原县石峡口水库，支援当地回族社员兴修水库。
    回汉族人民在水库建设中，还发挥了苦干、巧干精神。有些水库在地震区，为保证水库拦洪土坝的质量，他们创造了用红粘土、圪石土和黄土等多种土质混合兴建土坝的方法，使土坝结实稳固。现在工地上已经造了高线运土、木轨铁轨斗车、冰撬运土、木制羊脚磙碾等新工具数十种，工效比人背肩挑提高几倍到几十倍。有的工地基本上消灭了肩挑人背的现象，达到了运土“空中飞”、“地上推”。同心县张家湾水库，在没有机械设备的情况下，群众创造了能冷拉直径十二公厘钢筋的木制绞盘，使钢筋应力增加6％，并减少了除锈、回直两道工序。采用这种方法，今年各水库就能节约六十吨钢筋。固原县寺口子水库，经过多次试验，就地取材，利用粘土制造成功了二百号水泥，解决了工程所用的三千吨水泥的困难，给国家节省六万多元。（附图片）
