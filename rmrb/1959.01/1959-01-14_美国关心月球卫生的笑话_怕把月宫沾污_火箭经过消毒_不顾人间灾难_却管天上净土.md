Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The Soviet "Literary Gazette" recently published a short piece entitled "Everything is Difficult at the Beginning," wittily reporting on several lively moments from the press conference held in Moscow to celebrate the successful launch of the cosmic rocket.

The short piece reported that dozens of foreign and Soviet journalists packed the hall of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. It was a very lively press conference, with many journalists asking a barrage of questions.

A question from an American journalist drew laughter from the entire room.

Norton of the "Baltimore Sun" said that American lunar rockets, "in order not to contaminate the moon, are sterilized" before launch. He asked whether Soviet lunar rockets were also sterilized. At this point, the whole room burst into laughter.

The short piece wrote, "Ah! Those so-called champions of 'lunar hygiene,' while busily spreading radioactive poison on Earth and refusing to permanently ban nuclear weapons testing, show such moving concern for the desolate moon – how can people not laugh! Moreover, the 'sterilization' work done by American rocket manufacturers on their rockets is actually superfluous because, when their rockets burn up and crash to the ground, this is already the best possible 'sterilization.'"

During the press conference, when a journalist asked whether the Soviet Union planned to launch new cosmic rockets, the famous Soviet scientist, Academician Blagonravov, gave a concise yet profound answer. He smiled and said, "Everything is difficult at the beginning!"

    美国关心月球卫生的笑话
    怕把月宫沾污　火箭经过消毒
    不顾人间灾难　却管天上净土
    新华社13日讯　苏联“文学报”最近刊载了一篇题为“万事起头难”的短讯，别有风趣地报道了在莫斯科为发射宇宙火箭成功而举行的记者招待会上的几个生动镜头。
    短讯报道说，几十个外国的和苏联的记者挤满了苏联科学院主席团的大厅。这是一次非常热烈的记者招待会。许多记者提出了一大串一大串的问题。
    一个美国记者的问话引起了全场的哄堂大笑。
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”记者诺顿说，美国的月球火箭在发射前，
  “为了不致沾染了月球，都是消过毒的”，他问道，苏联的月球火箭是否也经过消毒？这时全场哄笑了。
    这篇短讯写道，是啊！那些所谓捍卫“月球卫生”的志士们，当自己正热中于在地球上散播放射性毒害，拒绝永久禁止核武器试验的时候，却对荒无人烟的月球表现了如此动人的关怀，怎不叫人发笑！而且，美国火箭制造家们给火箭所作的“消毒”工作也实在是多余的，因为，当他们的火箭一面焚毁，一面向地面栽下来的时候，这已经是再好不过的“消毒”了。
    在招待会上当有一位记者提出关于苏联是否还准备发射新的宇宙火箭的问题时，苏联著名的科学家布拉冈拉沃夫院士作出了简洁而又含义深远的回答。他微笑着说：“万事起头难！”
