    Relying on Local Party Committees, Relying on the Masses of Farmers
    The Sichuan-Henan Railway Advances at Full Speed

    Chengdu, January 25th (This newspaper) – The Chengdu-Nanchong section of the Sichuan-Henan Railway is progressing rapidly due to the method of joint construction by the railway department and the local authorities, and the vigorous mass movement. The Chengdu-Nanchong section is 222 kilometers long. From the official start of construction in late November last year, about six million cubic meters of earth and stone work had been completed in the thirty-plus days until the end of December, accounting for a quarter of the earth and stone work of the entire line. Construction of 110 bridges, tunnels, and culverts has started across the board, with nine major bridges already completing 30%-50% of the total project volume. The overall project progress is two to three times faster than the speed of general railway construction in the past.

    When the Sichuan-Henan Railway began preparations for construction last year, the railway department and Sichuan Province, along with three special districts and five counties along the line, jointly organized railway construction headquarters at all levels. The railway department transferred professional cadres and engineering technicians to participate in the work of the headquarters, and equipped them with some workers as technical backbone, responsible for the construction of especially large bridges. The labor force required for railway construction, raw materials, tools, and employee living supplies that could be solved locally were all the responsibility of the local Party committees. Various localities adopted the method of segmented contracting for construction.

    Based on the needs of railway construction and industrial and agricultural production, local prefectural and county Party committees made comprehensive arrangements for the supply of labor, materials, equipment, and daily necessities. Various localities transferred a batch of cadres and civilians to participate in railway construction, solving the problem of cadres and labor required for construction. Through cultivating experimental fields and running construction site Red and Expert schools, the railway department strengthened technical guidance, and a large number of cadres and civilians quickly mastered the technology of railway construction. Lacking construction tools, the local Party committees organized on-site production and mobilized the masses to bring their own, solving more than 320,000 items such as pickaxes, sledgehammers, and flat hoes, as well as more than 15,000 folk transport vehicles, shortly after the start of construction.

    In the past, when the railway department organized construction teams, it was necessary to spend money to build many sheds, which would take up a lot of farmers' arable land and would be abandoned after completion, resulting in a great waste. This time, the Sichuan-Henan Railway had the people's communes contract to solve the accommodation problem for the civilian workers. The communes allocated some civilian houses for the civilian workers to live in, and the railway department allocated funds from the state investment to the people's communes to build residential areas at a rate of two to three yuan per civilian worker, saving nearly one million yuan in shed costs. In the past, the railway department had to establish several hospitals and clinics for the road construction personnel, which not only cost a lot of money, but also made it difficult to solve the problems of medical personnel, housing, and medical equipment. Now, the district and township hospitals along the route are being expanded, and the railway department only allocates some funds and equips them with some cadres to ensure the needs of the construction site. This not only saves construction funds but also develops local health care, which the masses are very satisfied with. (Lü Xilin)

    依靠地方党委　依靠农民群众
    川豫铁路兼程挺进
    本报成都25日电　川豫铁路成都—南充段由于采取铁路部门和地方共同修建、大搞群众运动的办法，施工进展迅速。成都—南充段全长二百二十二公里，从去年11月下旬正式开工，到12月底的三十多天中，就已完成约六百万方土石方，占全线土石方工程的四分之一；一百一十座桥梁、隧道、涵洞工程普遍开工，其中九座大桥已经完成全部工程量的30％—50％。全线工程进度比过去一般铁路建设速度快两三倍。
    川豫铁路去年开始筹建时，铁路部门就和四川省、沿线三个专区、五个县共同组织了各级铁路修建指挥部。铁路部门调配专业干部和工程技术人员参加指挥部工作，配备一部分工人作技术骨干，担负特大桥梁的施工；修建铁路所需要的劳动力、地方能够解决的原材料、工具和职工生活供应问题，都由地方党委负责。各地采取分段包干的办法施工。
    沿线各地委、县委根据铁路建设和工农业生产的需要，全面安排了劳动力、物资器材和生活用品的供应。各地抽调出一批干部、民工参加铁路建设，解决了施工所需要的干部和劳动力问题。通过种试验田和办工地红专学校，铁路部门加强技术指导，大批干部、民工很快就掌握了修建铁路的技术。缺乏施工工具，地方党委便组织就地生产和发动群众自带，开工不久就这样解决了十字镐、钢锤、板锄等三十二万多件，民间运输工具一万五千多辆。
    过去由铁路部门组织施工队伍，需要花钱盖很多工棚，又要占农民不少耕地，完工后就不要了，浪费很大。这次川豫铁路由人民公社包干解决民工住宿问题，公社调剂出一部分民房供给民工住宿，铁路部门按每个民工二至三元从国家投资中调拨资金给人民公社去修建居民点，一共节约了将近一百万元的工棚费。过去铁路部门要为修路人员建立若干医院和门诊部，既要花不少钱，医务人员、房屋、医疗设备等又不好解决。现在由沿线各地扩充区、乡医院，铁路部门只拨出部分经费和配备一些干部，就保证了工地需要。这样既节约了建设资金，又发展了地方卫生保健事业，群众十分满意。　　　（吕希林）
