(Our newspaper, Harbin, 21st dispatch) The Changshou People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, has been using a commune members' representative congress to rectify the commune, which proves to be a good method of mass line that combines leadership with the masses and cadres with commune members for commune rectification.

The representatives in this commune members' representative congress include people from all aspects of the commune's organization, including leaders from the Party, government, and commune, as well as cadres and staff from factories, supply and marketing cooperatives, schools, militia organizations, and public welfare institutions such as canteens and nurseries. There are also leaders from the commune, management districts, and production teams, as well as young male and female production team members and experienced farmers.

The Changshou People's Commune relies on this core force to mobilize commune members to participate in commune rectification, allowing the masses to fully express their innermost thoughts. Their basic approach is: commune member representatives widely collect and prepare opinions before the meeting, and then hold the meeting. Led by the commune Party committee, resolutions are made on some urgent issues. Then, the commune member representatives return to the masses to further mobilize the masses to participate in airing views and rectifying. They plan to hold a commune member representative meeting in each stage of the entire commune rectification process, so that commune leaders and the masses can repeatedly exchange ideas, gradually deepening, enriching, and improving. Many representatives not only convene small meetings to collect mass opinions before and after the congress, but also visit door-to-door for conversations, thus maintaining close contact with the masses. After their congresses, the masses flock to them to confide their thoughts as soon as they return to the village. The Changshou People's Commune fully implements the principle of democratic centralism in the process of using the method of convening a commune member representative congress to rectify the commune, airing views while rectifying, and interspersing airing views with rectification, thereby making rectification swift and timely.

The labor wage grading conditions agreed upon by this commune in the past were not suitable. This time, the commune member representative congress decided to change the previous conditions, including the condition of ideological progress in the clause of labor attitude, and decided that each person's grading conditions should be concentrated on assessing the number of actual workdays completed in 1958. This commune did not allocate funds to reward production teams with good labor performance and individuals with good labor performance when distributing income in 1958. This time, the commune member representative congress decided to allocate 60,000 yuan for this aspect of the reward.

This method of rectifying the people's commune is fully suitable for the new situation of this year's commune rectification work. After its establishment, this commune has become a large grassroots social organization with more than 60 natural villages and more than 100 units, encompassing many aspects, and is no longer a single agricultural production unit. Especially in the current winter production, people are scattered hundreds of miles away to build water conservancy projects, engage in fertilizer production, or engage in winter sideline production. This situation makes the past method of rectifying advanced agricultural cooperatives by having township cadres divide their forces and guard different areas no longer suitable.

### 通过社员代表大会整社  尚志县长寿公社整改迅速及时

    通过社员代表大会整社
    尚志县长寿公社整改迅速及时
    本报哈尔滨21日电　黑龙江省尚志县长寿人民公社运用社员代表大会整社，事实证明是领导与群众相结合、干部与社员相结合的群众路线的一个整社好方法。
    在这个社员代表大会的代表当中，有公社组织各个方面的人，有党、政、社的领导人员，也有工厂、供销社、学校和民兵组织以及食堂、托儿所等公共福利事业机构的干部和工作人员，有公社、管理区和生产队领导干部，也有青年男女生产队员和老农。
    长寿人民公社依靠这个核心力量，发动社员群众参加整社，使群众把心里话全都说透。他们的基本做法是：社员代表在会前广泛搜集和准备意见，然后开会。由公社党委领导，就一些迫切问题作出决议。然后社员代表回到群众中间，进一步发动群众参加鸣放整改。他们在全部整社过程中准备每一阶段都开社员代表会一次，使公社领导和群众思想反复交流，逐步加深和丰富提高。许多代表在大会开会前后不仅召集小会搜集群众意见，而且挨门挨户访问谈心，因此和群众联系密切，在他们开过大会以后，一回村，群众就纷纷前来和他们谈心。长寿人民公社在采取召开社员代表大会的方法进行整社当中，充分贯彻了民主集中制的原则，边鸣放、边整改，鸣放和整改穿插进行，从而使得整改迅速及时。
    这个公社过去商定的劳动工资评级条件不够合适，这次社员代表会就决定改变过去的条件，把思想进步的条件订在劳动态度的一条里，并且决定每个人的评级条件应集中从1958年实做劳动日多少上加以考核。这个公社在进行1958年分配的时候没有拨款奖励劳动成绩好的生产队和劳动表现好的个人，这次社员代表大会就决定拨款六万元进行这方面的奖励。
    这个整顿人民公社的方法完全适合今年整社工作的新情况。这个公社在成立之后已经成为一个拥有六十多个自然村、一百多个单位的包括多方面的庞大的社会基层组织，再不是单一的农业生产单位。特别是在当前冬季大生产当中，人们分散在上百里远的地方修水利、搞粪肥或投入冬季副业生产。这种情况使得过去由乡干部分兵把口整顿高级农业社的办法不相适应了。
