Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: TASS Moscow, 8th: The first artificial planet will return to its original launch point after orbiting the sun one hundred and twenty-five times and meet with Earth. Theoretically, this should happen in the year 2113 AD. However, because the orbit of the cosmic rocket is affected by the Moon and various planets, the tenth planet will have no chance of colliding with Earth. The two cosmic bodies will pass through the area closest to each other. This was stated by Sternfeld, winner of the International Astronautics Encouragement Award, in an interview with a TASS reporter. The scientist based his calculations on the fact that the period of the artificial planet orbiting the sun is exactly four hundred and fifty Earth days.

In the recent decades, the new planet will be closest to Earth in early 1975. But even then, its distance from Earth will still be fifteen million kilometers. Sternfeld said that the rocket launched from Earth on January 2 will always travel along the same elliptical orbit, provided it does not encounter any obstacles in its operation (here, the influence of the planets is not taken into account). For this reason, it will return to the launch area each time, and sooner or later it will meet Earth at this point in space.

Sternfeld said that after four hundred and fifty days, the Soviet artificial planet will return to the area of ​​Earth's orbit where the artificial planet was launched. But by that time, the Earth itself will have moved far ahead along its own orbit, and its distance from the tenth planet will be far greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. After the artificial planet orbits twice, this distance will increase: their positions will be exactly one on one side of the sun and one on the other side of the sun. After the new planet orbits the sun three and four times, its distances from Earth will be 200 million kilometers and 67 million kilometers, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: According to TASS Moscow, Soviet astronomer and physicist Kozyrev published an article in "Teacher's Newspaper" on the 8th, saying that some secrets of the moon will be revealed in the near future. With the help of cosmic rocket observations, a final conclusion can be drawn on the question of whether the moon has its own thermal radiation.

Kozyrev discovered a volcanic eruption in the lunar crater "Alphonsus" on November 3 last year. He said that the instruments carried by the first cosmic rocket will help answer those questions that cannot be solved with astronomical telescopes with extremely high scientific precision.

Kozyrev wrote that, so far, the surface of the moon is believed to be covered with a thick layer of dust. If volcanic activity on the moon is still strong, the lava ejected to the surface of the moon will separate out the gases absorbed in the depths of the moon, resulting in a multi-bubble material with weak thermal conductivity on the lunar surface. Kozyrev said that future cosmic rockets will confirm this hypothesis.

    一百五十四年后
    人造行星将与地球重逢
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：第一个人造行星在围绕太阳运行一百二十五圈以后将回到原来的发射地点，并同地球相遇。从理论上来说，这应当发生在公元二千一百一十三年。但是，由于宇宙火箭的轨道受到月球和各行星影响而发生变化，第十个行星将没有可能同地球相碰。这两个宇宙体将在彼此相距最近的区域通过。这是国际宇宙航行鼓励奖获得者斯特恩菲尔德向塔斯社记者发表谈话时说的。这位科学家是以人造行星围绕太阳运行的周期正好为四百五十个地球日为根据，进行计算的。
    在最近的几十年中，新行星将在1975年初同地球最为接近。但就是那时它同地球的距离也还有一千五百万公里。斯特恩菲尔德说，1月2日从地球发射出的火箭，只要它在运行中不遇到任何障碍的话（这里没有把各行星的影响估计进去），将永远沿着同一条椭圆形轨道运行。正因为如此，它每次都将返回发射区，并迟早会在空间的这一点上同地球相遇。
    斯特恩菲尔德说，四百五十天以后苏联人造行星又将回到地球轨道上发射人造行星的区域。但是那时地球本身又沿着自己的轨道向前走得很远了，它距第十个行星的距离将远远超过地球与太阳之间的距离。在人造行星运行两圈以后，这个距离还会加大：它们的位置将正好是一个在太阳这一边，一个在太阳那一边。在新行星绕太阳运行三圈和四圈后，它同地球的距离分别为两亿公里和六千七百万公里。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联天文学家、物理学家科齐列夫8日在“教师报”上发表文章说，月球上的若干秘密在最近将来即可揭晓。借助于宇宙火箭的考察，月球是否有自己的热幅射问题即可得出最后结论。
    科齐列夫去年11月3日曾发现了月球上的“阿尔芬斯”寰形山发生过火山爆发。他说，第一个宇宙火箭所携带的仪器将帮助对那些用具有极高的科学精确性的天文望远镜也无法解决的问题得到答案。
    科齐列夫写道，到目前为止，月球的表面被认为是笼罩着厚厚的尘埃层。如果月球上火山活动还很强烈，喷出到月球表面的熔岩就会分离出在月球深部被吸收的气体，结果在月面上就会形成导热能力微弱的多气泡物质。科齐列夫说，未来的宇宙火箭将会对这一设想得到证实。
