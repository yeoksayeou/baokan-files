Steel rolling is like making noodles
	Thousands of degrees of high temperature are treated as commonplace,
	Soaring enthusiasm and high aspirations.
	No matter how strong and hard the steel is,
	Steel rolling is like making noodles.
    (Anshan steel rolling worker)

    轧钢好似压面条千度高温等闲置，干劲冲天志气高。任凭钢铁坚又硬，轧钢好似压面条。
    （鞍山轧钢工人）
