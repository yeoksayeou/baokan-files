    Lao Parliament Grants Government Special Powers
    TASS Reports Lao Reactionaries Deliberately Creating Border Disputes
    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: TASS Hanoi, January 14th: Vientiane Radio broadcast that the Lao Kingdom National Assembly approved granting the Sananikone government special powers on the morning of the 14th by a vote of twenty-eight to sixteen.
    Lao Prime Minister Sananikone requested at the National Assembly special session on the 12th to be granted the power to organize a new cabinet, and also requested the new government be granted special powers for a period of one year. He said that granting this power was necessary "due to changes in the domestic situation."
    Sananikone stated the program of the new government, the main points of which are to amend the constitution and hold National Assembly elections.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: TASS Hanoi, January 13th: Vientiane news: Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone issued a statement on January 11 regarding the relationship between Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, particularly concerning the border issue between the two countries. The border issue lies in Laos making unfounded claims to certain border territories of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Sananikone rejected the proposal repeatedly made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolve the issue through negotiations in a spirit of good neighborliness and equality. He groundlessly accused the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of infringing on the Lao border and "training" former Laotian combat troops within the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At the same time, the Lao Prime Minister had to admit that the incidents on the Vietnam-Laos border "would not have serious repercussions if they were not connected with the domestic situation in the Kingdom."
    News from Vientiane proves that the reactionary faction in Laos is using the tense relations created by the Lao government with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an excuse to attempt to establish a dictatorship with the support of certain groups in the United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam. For this purpose, Prime Minister Sananikone, at an emergency meeting of the National Assembly convened on January 12, spoke of "intensified subversion" and asked the National Assembly to give him "special powers" to reorganize the government and amend the constitution. He went on to say that Laos would continue to be a staunch supporter of the "free world" in the future.
    United Press International, in an apparently inflammatory report from Bangkok, predicted that a "coup is imminent" in Laos, which would follow the example of Thailand and Pakistan.
    Hanoi journalists believe that these reports show that Phoui Sananikone's statement on Laos's relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an attempt to deceive the Lao and world public, conceal the real reasons for the sharpening of relations between the two countries, and divert their attention from the schemes planned by reactionary forces at home and abroad against Laos. These journalists pointed out that the Lao army's provocations on the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as the propaganda of the propaganda organs of Thailand, South Vietnam and the United States slandering and groundlessly accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are aimed at covering up the measures that the American imperialists and their servants are preparing to take in Laos, namely, to suppress domestic democratic forces and drag Laos into the aggressive military bloc of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    老挝议会授予政府特别权力
    塔斯社报道老挝反动派制造边境纠纷别有用心
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社河内14日讯：据万象电台广播说，老挝王国国民议会14日上午以二十八票对十六票批准给予萨纳尼空政府以特别权力。
    老挝首相萨纳尼空12日在国民议会特别会议上要求赋予他组织新内阁的权力，并且要求赋予新政府为期一年的特别权力。他说，“由于国内情势改变”，赋予这种权力是必要的。
    萨纳尼空陈述了新政府的纲领，其中要点是修改宪法和举行国民议会选举。
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社河内13日讯：据万象消息：老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空1月11日就老挝同越南民主共和国之间的关系，特别是就两国之间的边界问题，发表了声明。边界的问题在于老挝对越南民主共和国的某些边疆领土提出了毫无根据的要求。萨纳尼空拒绝了越南民主共和国政府所一再提出的以睦邻和平等的精神进行谈判来解决这个问题的建议，他毫无根据地指责越南民主共和国侵犯老挝边境和在越南民主共和国境内“训练”前寮国战斗部队。同时老挝首相不得不承认，越南—老挝边境的事件“如果不是同王国国内情况有联系，是不会有严重的反应的”。
    来自万象的消息证明：老挝国内的反动派利用老挝政府所制造的同越南民主共和国的紧张关系作为借口，在美国、泰国和南越某些集团的支持下，企图建立独裁政权。由于这个目的，萨纳尼空首相在1月12日召开的国民议会紧急会议上，谈到了“颠复活动加剧”，要求国民议会给他“特别权力”来改组政府和修改宪法。他接着说，老挝今后将继续成为“自由世界”的一个坚决拥护者。
    合众国际社从曼谷发出的显然具有煽动性的消息中预言：老挝“即将发生政变”，这个政变将仿照泰国和巴基斯坦的榜样。
    河内新闻界人士认为，这些消息表明：培·萨纳尼空就老挝同越南民主共和国关系所发表的声明是企图蒙蔽老挝和全世界的公众，隐瞒使两国关系尖锐化的真正原因，转移他们对老挝国内外反动势力针对老挝而策划的计谋的注意。这些新闻界人士指出，老挝军队在越南民主共和国边境的挑衅以及泰国、南越和美国的宣传机关诽谤和毫无根据地责难越南民主共和国的宣传，目的是遮掩美帝国主义者和它的仆从们准备在老挝采取的措施，即镇压国内民主力量和把老挝拖进东南亚条约组织这个侵略性军事集团。
