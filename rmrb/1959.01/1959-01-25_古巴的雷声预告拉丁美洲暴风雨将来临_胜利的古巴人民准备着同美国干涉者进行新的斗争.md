Xinhua News Agency, January 24th – These days, the victory of the Cuban people has been attracting worldwide attention. The significance of the Cuban people's victory lies not only in overthrowing a dictatorial regime, but also in severely striking the American imperialists behind this regime.

Cuba is so close to the United States, just an hour away by plane. The American imperialists had long held it in their hands, treating it as an American colony. As early as 1823, then-US Secretary of State John Adams said that Cuba was a "natural appendage" of the North American continent, and that "incorporating Cuba into the territory of our federation is necessary for the continuation and integrity of the federation itself." Thus, Cuba was among the first batch of colonies that American imperialism reached out overseas to seize in its history. The United States occupied Cuba in 1898 through the Spanish-American War. The Cuban people resisted strongly, and the Republic of Cuba was established in 1902, after which the American invading forces had no choice but to withdraw from Cuba. Between 1906 and 1922, the United States again sent troops to Cuba three times to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. The United States still maintains two naval bases in Cuba to this day. The United States supported one dictatorial ruler after another in Cuba. Batista came to power directly under American instigation, relying on the constant influx of money and American weapons, and the support of American troops stationed at Cuban bases, to maintain his bloody rule. There used to be a saying in Latin America: "Latin America is too far from God and too close to the United States." However, right under the "nose" of the United States, the Cuban people bravely stood up, resolutely struggled, and achieved victory. The victory of the Cuban people cannot but give a tremendous impetus to the national independence movement throughout Latin America.

From December 1956, when Castro led dozens of Cuban youths to wage guerrilla warfare in Cuba, until today, when Batista was overthrown, it took only two years. The reactionary rule, which was fully supported by American imperialism, fully armed, and seemingly invincible, rapidly collapsed. The decisive factor was justice and the patriotic revolutionary youth on the side of the broad masses of the people who were resolutely fighting regardless of their own safety. In Latin America, Cuba is the first country to have won victory through a long-term people's armed struggle, completely defeating a dictatorial regime fostered by the United States. The victory of the Cuban people has opened a glorious page for the national liberation movement in Latin America.

In Latin America, American imperialism has consistently maintained its colonial interests through local reactionary dictators. However, since 1955, dictators in eleven countries colluding with the United States have fallen one after another. The rule of the remaining dictators in Paraguay and the Dominican Republic is also very unstable. After Batista's downfall, US President Eisenhower's brother, Milton Eisenhower, hurriedly presented a report, saying that the United States' past overt support for dictators was "committing some real mistakes," because "it can be clearly seen that throughout Latin America, there is a strong and irresistible trend toward freedom and democracy." Of course, the United States will never fail to support dictators in the future. What Milton Eisenhower advocated was only that it should not be done so overtly in the future; the United States will foster some dictators not only in Latin America but also in other places. However, the victory of the Cuban people shows that the desire of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries for independence, democracy, and freedom is the mainstream of the current world, and the reactionary countercurrent that the United States is trying to create is bound to fail.

The victory of the Cuban people has also fundamentally exposed the "paper tiger" nature of American imperialism, which appears strong but is inwardly weak. Since the Batista regime became increasingly shaky last year, the US government has repeatedly threatened the Cuban insurgents with great fanfare, and has several times plotted to directly send troops to interfere. Last July, the United States threatened to invade Cuba with the Marines. Later, it sent warships to the Cuban coast. However, the Cuban people's firm will stopped the bloody hand of the American interventionists.

The American ruling clique will certainly not give up. After they had no choice but to recognize the Cuban provisional government, they launched a propaganda campaign to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, and continued to conspire to subvert the Cuban provisional government by armed force. The million-person rally in Havana shows that the Cuban people are vigilant and ready to wage a new struggle against the American interventionists.

The Cuban people have made a victorious start to the Latin American national independence movement this year. There are reports that after Batista's downfall, American reporters scattered throughout Latin America were saying in fear that this was a "sign of a coming storm" for the entire Latin America, "storm clouds are pressing overhead." People everywhere in Latin America are demanding an end to the enslavement and rule of American monopoly capital. These days, American monopolists with investments in Latin America are rushing to Latin America in droves to "take care of business." The US Congress hurriedly established a special committee to immediately "investigate" the situation in Latin America and arrange new suppression measures. This shows that the Cuban people's struggle has indeed shaken the American ruling clique.

    古巴的雷声预告拉丁美洲暴风雨将来临
    胜利的古巴人民准备着同美国干涉者进行新的斗争
    新华社24日讯　这些天来，古巴人民的胜利，一直吸引着全世界的注意。古巴人民胜利的意义不只在于推翻了一个独裁政权，更在于沉重地打击了在这个政权背后的美帝国主义者。
    古巴离美国那么近，坐飞机只要一小时就可以到。美帝国主义者曾经长期把它抓在自己的手里，把它作为美国的殖民地。远在1823年，当时的美国国务卿约翰·亚当士就说过，古巴是北美大陆的“天然附属品”，“把古巴并入我们联邦的版图对于联邦本身的延续和完整是有必要的”。就这样，在美帝国主义历史上向海外伸手抢夺的第一批殖民地里，就有古巴。美国在1898年经由美—西（班牙）战争占领了古巴。古巴人民进行了强烈的反抗，1902年成立了古巴共和国，美国侵略军队这才不得不撤出古巴。而在1906年至1922年间，美国又曾经三次出兵古巴，干涉古巴的内政。美国并且至今仍在古巴保持着两个海军基地。美国在古巴扶植一个又一个独裁统治者。巴蒂斯塔是直接在美国指使下上台的，一直靠着源源而来的金元和美国武器，靠着驻扎在古巴基地的美国军队的支援，维持其血腥统治的。在拉丁美洲流行过一句话：“拉丁美洲离上帝太远，离美国太近。”但是，就在美国的“鼻子底下”，古巴人民勇敢地站起来，坚决进行斗争，取得了胜利。古巴人民的胜利，不能不给整个拉丁美洲民族独立运动以巨大鼓舞。
    从1956年12月卡斯特罗领导几十个古巴青年在古巴打游击开始，一直到今天推翻巴蒂斯塔，不过二年时间，有美帝国主义全力支撑的、全副武装的、看来似乎不可抵敌的反动统治，就迅速土崩瓦解了。决定性的因素就是正义和广大人民在奋不顾身地坚决进行斗争的爱国革命青年一边。在拉丁美洲，古巴是经过人民长期武装斗争，彻底打垮美国豢养的独裁政权而取得胜利的第一个国家。古巴人民的胜利，为拉丁美洲的民族解放运动开创了光辉的一页。
    在拉丁美洲，美帝国主义一贯是通过当地反动独裁者来维持它的殖民权益的。但是，从1955年以来，同美国勾结的十一个国家的独裁者一个一个相继倒台了。还存下的巴拉圭和多米尼加两个国家的独裁者，统治也十分不稳。在巴蒂斯塔倒台后，美国总统艾森豪威尔的兄弟密尔顿·艾森豪威尔赶紧陈上一个报告，说美国过去那样露骨地支持独裁者是“犯了一些实实在在的错误”，因为“可以明显地看到，在整个拉丁美洲，存在着一种强烈而不可抵挡的走向自由和民主的趋势”。当然，美国今后决不会不支持独裁者的。密尔顿·艾森豪威尔主张的也不过是今后不要做得那末露骨，美国不仅会在拉丁美洲，而且还会在其他地方扶植一些独裁者。但是，古巴人民的胜利说明了，殖民地半殖民地人民要求独立、民主、自由是当前世界的主流，美国力图制造的这股反动逆流是必然要遭到失败的。
    古巴人民的胜利，也从根本上揭穿了美帝国主义者外强中干的“纸老虎”本质。自从去年巴蒂斯塔政权日益动摇以后，美国政府曾一再对古巴起义人民气势汹汹地威胁过，并且好几度阴谋直接出兵干涉。去年7月，美国威胁要用海军陆战队进犯古巴。其后又派遣军舰前往古巴海岸。但是，古巴人民的坚决意志喝住了美国干涉者的血手。
    美国统治集团当然决不会就此罢休。他们在不得不承认古巴临时政府之后，又展开了干涉古巴内政的宣传运动，并且继续在阴谋武装颠复古巴临时政府。哈瓦那一百万人的集会表明，古巴人民在警惕着，准备同美国干涉者进行新的斗争。
    古巴人民给今年的拉丁美洲民族独立运动作出了胜利的开端。有消息说，在巴蒂斯塔倒台后，散在拉丁美洲各地的美国记者纷纷在忧惧地说，这是整个拉丁美洲“暴风雨来临的标志，暴风雨乌云压上头顶了”。拉丁美洲各处的人民在要求结束美国垄断资本的奴役统治。这些日子来，在拉丁美洲有投资的美国垄断资本家在成群地赶去拉丁美洲，“料理事务”。美国国会赶忙成立了一个特别委员会，立即“调查”拉丁美洲的情况，布置新的镇压措施。这说明，古巴人民的斗争确实已震撼了美国统治集团。
