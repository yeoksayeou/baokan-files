　　Talking About Chengjiang with Ten Thousand Truckloads of Mandarin Oranges
　　By Our Reporter Yi Xintian
　　White Flower Islet by the Chengjiang River, green orange groves and flowing river; in spring, orange blossoms are a white expanse, in autumn, mandarin oranges fill the trees; picking oranges at the start of winter, worried the baskets are too small, harvest after harvest follows the bumper crop.

　　The orange growers on both banks of the Chengjiang River in Huangyan County sing and write poetry, celebrating the great harvest of mandarin oranges with unparalleled joy. On January 20, I arrived in the orange-growing region with excitement. Although the mandarin oranges had been harvested for more than a month, large quantities were still being shipped out. Over 90% of Huangyan mandarin oranges are produced in Chengjiang Commune. In 1958, the commune's nearly 20,000 mu of orange groves produced 600,000 dan of mandarin oranges. If all were transported by three-ton trucks, it would take ten thousand truckloads.

　　According to the old saying, 1958 was a "small year" for the orange trees in Chengjiang Commune. However, the total output of mandarin oranges in the commune was not only no lower than a "big year," but even increased by nearly 10%. The achievement of surpassing a "big year" in a "small year" was created by the orange growers under the leadership of the Party, breaking superstitions and emancipating their minds. Here, many orange-growing experts have emerged. Zhang Youfa, known as an orange-growing expert, is one of the most outstanding. Zhang Youfa is a poor peasant who has grown oranges for more than ten years and is now the Party Branch Secretary of the Huijiang Production Team in Chengjiang Commune. Their team's 170 mu of orange groves averaged 5,736 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40% compared to the "big year" of 1957 and more than double the county's unit yield. He and several cadres jointly cultivated a little over one mu of experimental garden, creating a high record of ten thousand jin of oranges. Zhang Youfa was therefore honored to attend the National Representative Meeting of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction.

　　How was it possible to surpass a "big year" in a "small year?" I asked Zhang Youfa this question while we were working together in the orange grove. Zhang Youfa stopped hoeing and pondered for a moment, saying: Whether oranges have "big" or "small" years is entirely man-made, not something predestined by heaven. In the past, when it came to a "small year," many people superstitiously believed that the orange trees would bear fewer fruits, so they did not put much effort into cultivation, and the output was naturally low. Year after year, this gradually became a habit. Zhang Youfa and I talked while tidying up the orange grove. He is a farmer who loves to study technology. Over the years, he has continuously conducted various experiments. Now he has mastered more than ten kinds of citrus cultivation techniques and is familiar with their characteristics. Zhang Youfa heard that before liberation, the poor peasant Cai Qingchi used his only one fen of land to plant five orange trees, carefully cultivating them every year, and achieving a good harvest every year. Cai Qingchi's family of six all depended on the income from these five orange trees to live. Zhang Youfa thought: Why do other people's orange trees have "big" and "small" years, while Cai Qingchi's trees are different? He concluded that as long as the cultivation is good, there can be bumper harvests every year. Zhang Youfa and several cadres then cultivated a little over one mu of experimental garden. Fertilization, pest control, irrigation, pruning, and other advanced techniques were all first carried out in the experimental garden, and then the commune members were organized to visit and learn, and gradually promoted. In 1958, the entire production team's 170 mu of orange groves universally carried out fertilization before picking, frequently fertilizing, thinly fertilizing, and increasing the amount of fertilizer by nearly double compared to the previous year. Most of the orange groves achieved self-flowing irrigation through deep ditches and high ridges. For pest control, 1605 pesticides were also used to spray and basically eliminate white grubs, aphids, and leafroller larvae. Zhang Youfa also attached great importance to giving play to the role of the old orange growers. Experience told him: It is necessary to boldly adopt advanced technologies, but also to pay attention to absorbing the experience of the old farmers. Experienced old farmers often say, "Fertilizer and water are two treasures, orange trees cannot do without them; fruit trees need a lot of fertilizer, and they must also have enough water." The experience of the old farmers made him determined to do a good job in fertilization and water conservancy. Zhang Youfa led the masses to rely on the masses to create the achievement of surpassing a "big year" in a "small year," and now no one believes that a "small year" is predestined by heaven.

　　I walked along the Chengjiang River through orange grove after orange grove, and everywhere I saw commune members busy with cold protection, loosening the soil, and fertilizing the orange trees. Many orange trees are wearing "cotton pants" or have lime water applied to their bases to protect them safely through the winter. The commune members of Chengjiang Commune have proposed to double the output of mandarin oranges this year. (Attached picture)

    密桔万车话澄江
    本报记者  伊心恬
    澄江边上白花洲，桔林青青江水流；春来桔花一片白，秋到桔子满树黄；立冬采桔嫌箩小，丰收后面接丰收。
    黄岩县澄江两岸的桔农吟诗作歌，以无比喜悦的心情，欢庆蜜桔大丰收。1月20日，我怀着兴奋的心情来到了桔区。虽然蜜桔已采摘了一个多月，但大批蜜桔还在陆续外运。黄岩蜜桔90％以上产在澄江公社。1958年全社近两万亩桔园共产蜜桔六十万担，如果全用三吨卡车装运，可以装一万车。
    按照旧说法，澄江公社的桔树1958年是小年，可是全社蜜桔产量不仅不比大年低，还比大年增产近一成。小年超大年的成就是桔农在党的领导下破除迷信解放思想创造出来的。这里，涌现出许多种桔能手。被人们称为种桔专家的张友法就是比较突出的一个。张友法是种了十多年桔子的贫农，现在是澄江公社汇江生产队党支部书记。他们队一百七十亩桔园，平均亩产五千七百三十六斤，比1957年大年增产四成多，比全县单位产量高出一倍。他和几位干部合搞的一亩多试验园，创造了万斤桔的高额纪录。张友法因此光荣地出席了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。
    小年超大年是怎样创造出来的呢？我和张友法在桔园里一起劳动的时候提了这个问题。张友法停下锄头沉思了一会说：桔子有无大小年全是人为的，不是什么天定的。过去到了“小年”，很多人迷信桔树少结果，就不下大力加工培育，结果产量当然就低，年年如此，就逐渐成为一种习惯势力了。张友法和我边整理桔园边谈着。他是一个很爱钻研技术的农民，几年来，他不断进行着各种试验，现在他已掌握了十多种柑桔的栽培技术，熟悉了它们的特性。张友法听说贫农蔡青池解放前利用他仅有的一分地，种了五株桔树，年年细心培育，每年都能丰收。蔡青池一家六口全靠这五株桔树的收入过活。张友法想：同样种桔树为什么别人的树有大小年，蔡青池的树却不同呢？他从而得出结论：只要培育的好，年年都能丰产。张友法就和几个干部搞了一亩多试验园。施肥、除虫、灌溉、修剪等每项先进技术他都在试验园先搞，然后组织社员参观学习，逐步推广。1958年全生产队经营的一百七十亩桔园，普遍进行采前施肥，勤施，薄施，施肥量比上年增加近一倍。桔园大多做到深沟高畦灌溉自流化。除虫也采用喷射1605药剂，把白蚰、蚜虫、卷叶蛾幼虫基本上一扫光。张友法还很重视发挥老桔农的作用。经验告诉他：既要大胆采用先进技术，又要注意吸取老农的经验。有经验的老农常说“肥跟水是两个宝，桔树少不了；果树肥要多，水也要吃饱。”老农的经验使他决心搞好施肥和水利化。张友法领导群众依靠群众创造了小年超大年的成就，现在再也没有人认为小年是天定的了。
    我沿着澄江走过一片片桔园，到处看到社员们在忙着为桔树防寒、松土和施肥。许多桔树穿上了“棉裤”或在树脚涂上石灰水保护安全过冬。澄江公社的社员们提出今年要使密桔产量翻一番。（附图片）
