People's Communes are Good

The National Agricultural Exhibition uses rich materials to prove that in 1958, China's crops achieved an all-round Great Leap Forward and a brilliant harvest of grain. The total national grain output reached about 750 billion jin, more than double the increase of 1957, and nearly two and a half times the increase of 1949.
According to incomplete statistics from January to September 1958, 6.68 million industrial and mining enterprises were built in counties and townships across the country. It can be said that China's vast rural areas have entered a new period of vigorously developing industry. The National Agricultural Exhibition has rich materials to illustrate this point.

The commune is like a boat,
The east wind fills the sails,
The helmsman is our Chairman Mao,
The crew is 600 million strong.

The total cotton output in 1958 was about 67 million dan, an increase of about 34 million dan compared to 32.8 million dan in 1957.

In 1958, oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame also had a large increase in production. Excluding those not used for oil extraction, the edible vegetable oil that can be produced increased by about 50% compared to 1957.

    全国农业展览会用丰富的材料证明：1958年我国农作物获得了全面大跃进、五谷大丰登的辉煌成绩。全国粮食总产量达到七千五百亿斤左右，这比1957年增产一倍还多一点，比1949年增产近两倍半。
    根据1958年1月到9月的不完全统计，我国县乡建设的工矿企业达六百六十八万个。可以说我国广大农村已经进入大办工业的新时期。全国农业展览会有丰富的材料说明了这个问题。　高　宏摄

    东风鼓起船上帆，
    舵手是咱毛主席，
    赶船的人六万万。
