    Dawn Over the Fields [Works from the Second National Photography Art Exhibition]

    Dawn reflecting on the fields,
    Laughter and chatter from the nursery:
    Children surround their caregivers,
    Nursery workers lead the toddlers.

    Nursery workers lead the toddlers,
    Like a cluster of delicate, vibrant flowers.
    She is a young woman,
    Now surpassing even a mother.

    Day after day, meticulously caring,
    Releasing mothers from worry;
    Day after day, diligently nurturing,
    Allowing children to grow strong.

    Like the saplings by the roadside,
    The sun shines, the wind blows, the rain pours.
    Good gardeners support them day and night,
    Until green shoots emerge in spring.

    Everyone expresses heartfelt gratitude,
    Thanking you, young mothers,
    For the sake of socialism,
    You are mothers to many children!

    Dawn reflecting on the fields,
    Nursery workers lead the toddlers.
    See the earth, a tapestry of flowers,
    See the boundless happiness of the commune!

    田野朝霞〔第二届全国摄影艺术展览作品〕
    杨震河　摄影　江城树　配诗田野上映着朝霞，托儿所笑语喧哗：孩子们拥着阿姨，保育员带着娃娃。保育员带着娃娃，像一丛娇艳鲜花。她本是年轻姑娘，如今却赛过妈妈。一天天细心照料，让妈妈无牵无挂；一天天辛勤抚育，让孩子健壮长大。就像那路边小树，太阳晒风吹雨洒。好园丁日夜扶持，到春天透绿发芽。人人都同声感谢，感谢你年轻妈妈，你为了社会主义，做许多孩子的妈妈！田野上映着朝霞，保育员带着娃娃。看大地万花如锦，看公社幸福无涯！（附图片）
