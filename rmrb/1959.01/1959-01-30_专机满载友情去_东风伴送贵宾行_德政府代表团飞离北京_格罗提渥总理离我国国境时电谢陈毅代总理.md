When flying over the border between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic, I, on behalf of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, would like to express once again our heartfelt thanks to you, dear Comrade Premier, and through you to the government and people of the People's Republic of China for the warm reception we have received.
