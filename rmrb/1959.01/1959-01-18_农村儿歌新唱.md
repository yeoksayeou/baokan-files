New Renditions of Rural Children's Songs
    Jin Jin

    This year is a great harvest year, this year is a great harvest year, we will have everything: With tractors, we don't need oxen to plow the fields; the commune has cars, so we don't need to walk to town; with a power station built, we don't need oil for lighting; with a hospital in the village, we don't need to worry about getting sick.

    Little tea-picking sister, where do you come from? I come from Mount Mogong. What is on Mount Mogong? The mountains are full of tea leaves waiting to be picked. Pick during the day, stir-fry at night, machine-stir-fried tea is good and fast, thousands upon thousands of dan can't be filled up, the supply and marketing cooperative has sent cars.

    Rice-planting boat, rice-planting boat, so clever, sitting on the boat planting rice seedlings, the seedlings are planted quickly, no need to bend over much. This little boat is small, but it is better than a chair, no need to row to go back and forth, just push with your feet and it will run with you.

    农村儿歌新唱
    金近
    今年大丰收今年大丰收，样样都会有：有了拖拉机，耕田不用牛；社里有汽车，进城不用走；造好发电站，点灯不用油；乡里办医院，生病不用愁。
    采茶叶小妹妹，你从哪里来？我从莫公山上来。莫公山上有什么？满山茶叶要人采。日里采，夜里炒，机器炒茶好又快，千担万担装不完，供销社派了汽车来。
    插秧船插秧船，真灵巧，坐在船上插秧苗，秧苗插得快，不用多弯腰。这只小船虽然小，它比椅子还要好，来去不要橹来摇，两脚一撑跟你跑。
