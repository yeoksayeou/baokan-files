The talks lasted nearly an hour and a half.

Upon leaving the White House, Mikoyan gave a speech to many American and foreign journalists. He said that during the talks, many issues of interest to our two countries were discussed. We did not hold negotiations, but merely explained the positions of our two countries on a series of international issues. At the end of the talks, we all - President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and I - concluded that this was a beneficial exchange of views. On behalf of Khrushchev, I extended greetings to Eisenhower, wished him good health, and wished him success in his activities to improve relations between our two countries. The President expressed his gratitude and asked me to convey the same wishes to Khrushchev.

Following Mikoyan's talks with President Eisenhower, White House Press Secretary Hagerty told reporters that the issues of Berlin, Germany, disarmament, expanding trade between the two countries, and expanding the "free visit of personnel between the two countries" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union were discussed during the meeting. Hagerty also said that no "new proposals were put forward" during the talks. In response to reporters' questions, Hagerty said that President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles both considered the exchange of views with Mikoyan to be "beneficial."
