Stop the Bloodstained Hands of Human Traffickers!
Commentator of this newspaper

Recently, the Syngman Rhee clique is plotting a "migration" conspiracy, intending to forcibly sell South Korean residents to countries in Central and South America, in reality selling them to foreign capitalists and farm owners as slaves. The targets of these immigrants are mainly North Korean residents abducted by US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique during the Korean War and retired soldiers of the Syngman Rhee army. This inhuman crime cannot but arouse the anger of all Korean people and peace-loving and just people all over the world. To this end, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 22nd, solemnly condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's crime of trafficking in South Korean residents, demanding that the Syngman Rhee clique hand over all South Korean unemployed people who are preparing to be forcibly moved to foreign countries to North Korea, and demanding that US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique quickly return the residents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea abducted during the Korean War. We fully support the statement of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and fully support this just and humanitarian demand!

Under the cruel rule and crazy exploitation of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korea today has become a living hell! American surplus materials flood the South Korean market, causing the South Korean economy to go bankrupt across the board. At present, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed in South Korea has reached more than 4 million, hundreds of thousands of homeless orphans and war widows are wandering the streets, and more than 3 million food-deficient farmers are on the verge of starvation. After carrying out bone-sucking exploitation of South Korea, US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique are now colluding to do a new business - human trafficking! On January 8 this year, the Syngman Rhee clique passed a so-called "Overseas Immigration Outline" and formulated a specific implementation plan on the 15th to carry out the criminal act of trafficking in South Korean residents. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee clique is selling more than 1,200 Korean orphans to American farm owners to be slaves! This inhuman crime of human trafficking once again exposes the nature of American pirates and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique!

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always been concerned about the tragic situation of the people in South Korea and has extended a helping hand to them more than once. In August last year, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided to provide 150,000 석 (seok) of white rice, 5 million meters of textiles, 4 million pairs of shoes, and 10,000 tons of aquatic products free of charge to relieve South Korean unemployed people, and was willing to take in all South Korean orphans and provide 3,000 South Korean university students in difficult circumstances with a scholarship of 1,000 North Korean won per person per month, to fulfill its national obligation. At the same time, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has done everything possible to enable overseas compatriots, including 600,000 Korean compatriots in Japan, to return to their country. However, the Syngman Rhee clique not only does not accept the assistance of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the people of South Korea, does not care about the suffering compatriots overseas, but instead regards South Korean residents and orphans as commodities to be traded abroad! This crime is truly outrageous! This fully shows that the Syngman Rhee clique, which does all kinds of evil, is an enemy of the entire Korean nation and an enemy of human civilization! Human traffickers who undermine human dignity must be condemned by all progressive mankind!

It must be pointed out here that the root of all the misfortunes in South Korea lies in the fact that US imperialism still occupies South Korea, preventing the early realization of Korea's reunification and causing the people of South Korea to fall into deeper and deeper misery! People all over the world who love peace and justice must call out with the Korean people: Stop the bloodstained hands of human traffickers! The troops of the United States and its puppets must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible!

    制止人口贩子的血手！
    本报评论员
    最近，李承晚集团正在策划一项“移民”阴谋，打算把南朝鲜居民强迫出卖给中、南美国家，实际上就是把他们卖给外国资本家和农场主当作奴隶。这些移民的对象主要是在朝鲜战争期间被美帝国主义和李承晚集团劫走的朝鲜北部居民和李承晚军队的退伍军人。这种灭绝人性的罪行，不能不引起全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的愤怒。为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府于22日发表声明，严正谴责李承晚集团贩卖南朝鲜居民的罪行，要求李承晚集团把这些准备强迫迁往外国的南朝鲜失业者全部交给朝鲜北部，并且要求美帝国主义和李承晚集团迅速交回在朝鲜战争期间劫走的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国居民。我们完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的声明，完全支持这种正义的人道主义的要求！
    在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的残酷统治和疯狂压榨之下，今天的南朝鲜已成人间地狱！美国剩余物资充斥南朝鲜市场，使得南朝鲜经济全面破产。目前，南朝鲜的失业和半失业者已达四百多万，几十万流浪孤儿和战争寡妇徬徨街头，三百多万缺粮农民奄奄待毙，美帝国主义和李承晚集团在对南朝鲜进行了敲骨吸髓的压榨之后，现在又互相勾结做一笔新的生意——贩卖人口！今年1月8日，李承晚集团通过了一项所谓“海外移民纲要”，并且在15日制定了具体执行方案，以便进行贩卖南朝鲜居民的罪恶勾当。同时，李承晚集团正在把一千二百多名朝鲜孤儿卖给美国农场主去作奴隶！这种灭绝人性的贩卖人口的罪恶行为，再一次暴露了美国海盗和李承晚卖国集团的本性！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一向关怀朝鲜南部人民的悲惨处境，曾经不止一次地向他们伸出援救之手。去年8月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府又决定无偿地提供十五万石白米、五百万公尺纺织品、四百万双鞋子和一万吨水产品，救济南朝鲜失业者，并且愿意负责收养南朝鲜的全部孤儿和向三千名处境困难的南朝鲜大学生提供每人每月一千元朝鲜币的奖学金，以尽其民族的义务。同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府还为了使包括六十万旅日朝鲜侨胞在内的旅外侨胞返国而尽了一切的努力。然而，李承晚集团不仅不接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对南朝鲜人民的援助，不仅不关心在海外受苦的侨胞，反而把南朝鲜的居民和孤儿当作商品到外国去做买卖！这种罪行实在令人发指！这充分说明了无恶不作的李承晚集团是朝鲜全民族的敌人，也是人类文明的敌人！破坏人类尊严的人口贩子必须遭到全体进步人类的谴责！
    这里必须指出：南朝鲜一切不幸的根源都在于美帝国主义至今仍然霸占着南朝鲜，使朝鲜的统一不能早日实现，使南朝鲜人民日益陷于水深火热之中！全世界爱好和平和正义的人民都要跟朝鲜人民一起呼吁：制止人口贩子的血手！美国及其仆从的军队必须早日从朝鲜南部撤出去！
