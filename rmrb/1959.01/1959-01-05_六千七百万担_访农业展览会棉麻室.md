Sixty-Seven Million Dan

Visiting the Cotton and Hemp Room of the Agricultural Exhibition

By our reporter Xu Shijie

In 1958, Chinese farmers, with their miracle-creating hands, erected a new and immortal milestone in China's and the world's cotton production history. This milestone marks China's entry onto the path of high-speed development of cotton production. Now, a miniature of this milestone is on display at the National Agricultural Exhibition: the Cotton and Hemp Room.

Large-Area Bumper Harvests, High-Speed Production Increase

Five innocent and lively children are carrying a giant cotton boll nearly ten feet tall, doubled over with laughter. A row of red characters on the colorful ribbon around the cotton boll tells people: "In 1958, China's total ginned cotton production reached approximately 67 million dan, surpassing the United States..." When people enter the Cotton and Hemp Room and encounter this model celebrating the harvest, their hearts can't help but surge with joy, and some urgent questions arise: What does this "67 million dan" mean? What significant economic, political, and scientific value does it hold?

The cotton hall is filled with a dense array of large red charts, harvest maps, and high-yielding cotton plants, showcasing the glorious achievements of large-area high yields and high-speed growth on China's cotton production front in 1958. On the red charts, red flags fly over regions that have surpassed the 100-jin ginned cotton mark per mu. These regions are so vast, they encompass about two-fifths of the cotton-planted area in 1958. Charts also indicate that the national cotton yield per mu increased from 38 jin in 1957 to approximately 80 jin last year; the vast majority of cotton fields have reached or exceeded the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program to be achieved by 1967. People may remember that at the previous National Agricultural Exhibition in 1957, not to mention "100-jin counties," even "100-jin cooperatives" were rare!

In the cotton hall, even the most conservative person cannot find any argument against the possibility of high-speed production increases in any type of region. Here, the most vivid leap forward situation of 1958 is displayed: low-yield turning into high-yield, and high-yield becoming even higher-yield. Look! Below are the titles of large-area bumper harvest special zone and county red charts from various regions: "Ten Thousand Acres of Silver Waves Covering Jianghan, Jingzhou Achieves a Double-Hundred-Jin Ginned Cotton Special Zone," "Double-Hundred-Jin Ginned Cotton County on the Edge of the Ancient Yellow River Course," "On the Gobi Desert...," "Beside the Jinsha River...," "Hexi Corridor..." These red charts shatter the "condition theory" of conservatives. They show that, compared to the previous year's unit area yield, Xiangyang Special Zone in Hubei and Nanyang Special Zone in Henan, both traditionally known as low-yield areas, have increased by about three times; some new cotton areas and remote, scattered cotton areas, such as Siyang and Xinyu, have also increased by one, two, or even three or four times; high-yield areas have become even higher-yielding, such as the famous old cotton areas of Xinxiang in Henan, Jin County in Hebei, and Cixi in Zhejiang, all of which have increased by more than one or two times.

From these charts and objects, from the moving explanations of the narrators, and from the detailed inquiries with the staff, people quickly understand the meaning of "67 million dan": in the practice of large-area bumper harvests in 1958, we have found a path to develop cotton production at high speed.

Sixty-seven million dan also shows that it took the United States nearly fifty years to increase cotton production from 8.88 million dan to 67 million dan, while China only took nine years.

However, the most important thing that sixty-seven million dan demonstrates is that the key to a greater cotton harvest this year lies in carrying out a large-scale high-yield and bumper harvest movement. Although the planned cotton planting area is not expected to increase or increase very little this year, we have the confidence and basis to achieve the leap forward plan for 1959. This basis is the large-area bumper harvest of 1958.

A Gallery of Heroes on the Cotton Planting Front

The fundamental reason for the great victory in cotton production is the implementation of putting politics in command, the mass line, and the "Eight-Point Charter." The heroic images exhibited in the cotton hall all prove the victory of putting politics in command and the victory of the mass line.

On the large red chart of Jingzhou Special Zone in Hubei Province, which achieved a per-mu yield of double-hundred-jin ginned cotton, the scene of a great disaster and a great harvest is displayed before people's eyes. It was in this field of white cotton that, in April and May, when the cotton seedlings were still very small, it suffered three cold waves, one hailstorm, and more than forty days of continuous rain. Two hundred and eighty thousand mu were completely frozen to death. However, the people of Jingzhou Special Zone, armed with the general line, became even more enthusiastic, and the disaster further inspired their fighting spirit. Most areas of the zone replanted continuously three times, finally overcoming the disaster. In this way, the cotton planting heroes of Jingzhou Special Zone won the red flag of the double-hundred-jin special zone.

Dunhuang County, located on the Northwest Plateau near the vast Gobi Desert, has been able to increase cotton production year after year, and won the red flag again last year. A fundamental reason is that the county party committee conducted in-depth investigations and research, guiding farmers throughout the county to master the natural laws of cotton production. Precisely because the county party committee led the masses to combine the spirit of scientific analysis with down-to-earth hard work, the county has increased production every year, and went to a higher level last year. It is difficult to write out one by one the heroes introduced here in the picture boards and explanations. Behind each hero's name here, there is a novel hidden, so how can this short article introduce the heroes clearly one by one?

New Developments in Cotton Planting Technology

The Cotton and Hemp Room also exhibits new developments in China's cotton planting technology. People who plant cotton are very familiar with this: In recent years, in terms of cotton planting technology in our country, the struggles between irrigation and no irrigation (late-stage irrigation), topdressing and no topdressing (late-stage topdressing), deep plowing and shallow plowing, close planting and sparse planting, early sowing and late sowing, and management and no management (late-stage management) have been exceptionally fierce. Now, the large-area high-yield experiences in the cotton hall have drawn conclusions about these debates. All the red charts and objects prove that deep plowing, early sowing, rational close planting, reforming tools, and strengthening late-stage management, especially carrying out large-scale irrigation and topdressing in both the early and late stages, are important technical measures for last year's bumper harvest.

Regarding the long-standing problem of cotton boll shedding, many places began to accumulate some prevention and control experience in 1958. For example, Xieyu County implemented measures such as early sowing, more deep cultivation, more fertilization, and artificial pollination. Last year, the boll abscission rate of general cotton fields has been reduced from 70% to 50%, and the boll abscission rate of some satellite fields has been reduced to about 30%.

From the red charts, people have also seen many creative new attempts. According to the leap forward in production conditions last year, farmers in Xieyu County, Shanxi Province, did not top 80% of the cotton in the county; many areas universally postponed topping, and all achieved bumper harvests last year. The success of these attempts, especially the implementation of the agricultural "charter" mentioned earlier, is not only a fundamental revolution in China's cotton planting technology, but also provides a technical basis for China's cotton planting history to enter a new stage of planting less and harvesting more.

When people walk out of the Cotton and Hemp Room, their mood is always unable to calm down for a long time. Shouts from the bottom of their hearts, cheering long live the cotton heroes! Cheering that while our country has won brilliant achievements on the industrial front, the agricultural front has also had bumper harvests of all grains!

    六千七百万担
    访农业展览会棉麻室
    本报记者  徐士杰
    1958年，我国农民以他们创造奇迹的双手，在我国、同时也在世界棉花生产史上，竖下了一尊不朽的新的里程碑。这尊碑，标志着我国已经踏上了高速度发展棉花生产的大道。现在，这尊里程碑的缩影正在全国农业展览会展出，它就是棉麻室。
    大面积的丰收，高速度的增产
    五个天真活泼的孩子抬着一颗丈把高的大棉桃，乐得前仰后合。棉桃身上彩带边的一排红字告诉人们：“1958年，我国皮棉总产量达到六千七百万担左右，已超过美国……”。当人们一进棉麻室就遇上这场欢庆丰收的模型的时候，心里都禁不住欢情翻腾，一些迫切需要解答的问题也就油然而生了：这个“六千七百万担”意味着什么呢？它蕴藏有多么重大的经济意义、政治影响和科学价值呢？
    棉花大厅里密密麻麻的大红榜、丰收图、丰产棉棵，把1958年我国棉花生产战线上大面积丰产、高速度增长的辉煌战绩展示给人们。红榜上已经跃进过百斤皮棉大关的地区红旗横飞。这些地区是这样的辽阔，它大约包括了占1958年植棉面积五分之二左右的棉田。图表还表明：全国棉花亩产，在过去一年中已由1957年的三十八斤提高到八十斤左右；绝大多数的棉田亩产量已经达到或者超过了全国农业发展纲要规定的要在1967年达到的指标。人们可能还记得，1957年举办的上一次全国农业展览会上，不说百斤皮棉县，就是“百斤社”也还是凤毛麟角呢！
    在棉花大厅里，最保守的人也找不出任何一类地区不能高速度增产的论据。这里摆出的1958年的最鲜明的跃进形势是：低产变高产，高产更高产。看！下边就是来自各种地区的大面积丰产专、县红榜的标题：“万顷银波漫江汉，荆州实现双百斤皮棉专区”，“黄河古道边的双百斤皮棉县”，“戈壁滩上……”，“金沙江边……”，“河西走廊……”。这些红榜把保守派的“条件论”打得粉碎。它们表明：拿去年的单位面积产量和前年相比，一向著名的低产区湖北的襄阳专区和河南的南阳专区都猛增三倍左右；一些新棉区和边远分散棉区，像泗阳、新余等也增产一倍、两倍、甚至三、四倍；高产区的产量更高了，比如著名老棉区河南的新乡、河北的晋县、浙江的慈溪等县也都增长一倍多、两倍以上。
    人们从这些图表和实物上，从讲解员动人的讲解里，从和工作人员细致的探询中、很快也就清楚了“六千七百万担”的含意，那就是：在1958年大面积丰收的实践中，我们已经找出了一条高速度发展棉花生产的道路。
    六千七百万担还说明：棉花产量从八百八十八万担提高到六千七百万担，美国花费了近五十年的时间，而我国只用了九年。
    但是，六千七百万担说明的最重要的还不是这些，而是指出了今年棉花更大丰收的关键在于开展大面积高额丰产田运动。虽然今年预计棉花的播种面积没有什么增加或增加很少，但我们有信心有根据实现1959年的跃进计划，这根据就是1958年的大面积丰收。
    植棉战线上的群英谱
    取得棉花生产的巨大胜利的根本原因是：政治挂帅、群众路线、和“八字宪法”的贯彻。棉花大厅展出的英雄的形象，都在证明着政治挂帅的胜利，群众路线的胜利。
    在湖北省荆州专区亩产皮棉双百斤的大红榜上，大灾大丰收的场景显现在人们眼前。就是这片白棉似海的田野，4、5月间，正当棉苗还很小的时候，遭受了三次寒潮、一次雹灾和四十多天的连阴雨，有二十八万亩全部冻死。被总路线武装了的荆州专区人民干劲却更大了，灾害更激励了他们的斗志，全区大部分地区连续补种三次，终于战胜了灾害。就这样，荆州专区的植棉英雄们夺得了双百斤专区的红旗。
  位于西北高原临近大戈壁沙漠的敦煌县，棉花能够年年增产，去年又夺红旗，一条根本的原因，就是这个县的县委深入调查研究，引导全县农民掌握了棉花生产的自然规律。正是由于县委领导群众把科学分析精神和踏踏实实地干劲结合起来，因此，这个县年年增产，去年更上了一层楼。要一一写出这里图版上和讲解里介绍的英雄们，是困难的。这里的每一个英雄名字的背后，都藏有一部小说，这篇短文又怎么能把英雄们一一介绍清楚呢？
    植棉技术的新发展
    棉麻室还展出了我国植棉技术的新发展。种棉的人都非常熟悉：几年来，我国在植棉技术上，灌与不灌（后期灌溉）、追肥与不追肥（后期追肥）、深耕与浅耕、密植与稀植、早播与迟播、管与不管（后期管理）的斗争异常激烈。现在，棉花大厅里大面积丰产的经验对这些争论作了结论。所有的红榜和实物都证明：深耕、早种、合理密植、改革工具、加强后期管理，特别是早期后期都大搞灌溉、追肥，是去年丰收的重要技术措施。
    对于棉花落蕾落铃这个多年没有解决的老问题，1958年许多地方也都开始积累了一些防治的经验。如解虞县实行早种、多中耕、多施肥、人工授粉等措施，去年一般棉田的蕾铃脱落率已从70％降到50％，有些卫星田落铃率已降低到30％左右。
    从红榜上，人们还看到了许多富有创造性的新尝试。山西省解虞县农民根据去年生产条件跃进的情况，全县80％的棉花不打顶尖；许多地区普遍推迟打尖，去年都取得大丰收。这些尝试的成功，特别是前边说的农业“宪法”的贯彻，不仅是我国植棉技术上的根本革命，而且也为我国植棉历史进入少种多收的新阶段提供了技术基础。
    当人们走出棉麻室的时候，心情总是久久不能平静。从心底发出呼喊，欢呼棉花英雄们万岁！欢呼我国在工业战线夺得光辉成就的同时，农业战线上也五谷丰登！
