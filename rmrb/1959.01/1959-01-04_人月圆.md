    Ren Yue Yuan (Tune: 人月圆)
    Deng Tuo

    In the moon palace today, the immortals make merry,
    The New Year welcomes honored guests.
    Rockets of mankind,
    Soaring through clouds and mist,
    Fly to the gates of heaven.
    Chang'e wants to speak,
    Longing for ten thousand generations,
    Tears soaking her kerchief.
    Future undertakings,
    The Soviet Union takes the lead,
    The whole world is like a neighbor.

    人月圆
    邓拓月宫今日群仙乐，新岁接嘉宾。人间火箭，腾云驾雾，飞到天门。嫦娥欲语，相思万代，热泪盈巾。未来事业，苏联为首，六合如邻。
