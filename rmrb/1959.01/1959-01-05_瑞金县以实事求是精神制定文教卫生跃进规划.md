Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 4th: The people of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province—a culturally advanced county—based on the requirements for culture and health proposed in the Ten Initiatives of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, and after summarizing the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, have formulated a leap forward plan and measures for culture and health in 1959 with redoubled revolutionary vigor and a realistic and pragmatic spirit.

Ruijin, the revolutionary capital, suffered serious destruction and damage by the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, and culture, education, and health were extremely backward. In some areas, not a single literate person could be found in several villages, and diseases seriously threatened people's health. After liberation, especially in the year of the Great Leap Forward last year, thanks to the care and help of the Party and the government, and through the hard work of the people, the county's culture, education, and health undertakings have developed rapidly, leaping to become an advanced county in the province. Last year, the county basically eliminated illiteracy, and primary schools were established in every village, and amateur middle schools or agricultural middle schools were established in every township. As the people's cultural level has improved, rural literary and artistic creation and recreational activities have also become unprecedentedly active. This year, on the basis of popularization, the focus of the county's cultural and educational work will shift to consolidation and improvement. Teaching guidance will be strengthened to gradually regularize all spare-time red and expert schools and spare-time middle schools, and to ensure that there are two hours of study time every day, except for special circumstances during the busy farming season. It is required that all young and middle-aged people reach the level of higher primary school by the end of the year, and that 30% of them have a junior high school level in language. The established art school's main task is to train farmer directors, actors, and activists in cultural and recreational activities in order to strengthen the backbone of the existing clubs and troupes of the people's communes, so that every commune has a cultural center and every team has a library. At the same time, various sports activities such as basketball and track and field should also be widely carried out according to the needs of the masses. In terms of health work, a mass patriotic health campaign will be launched in conjunction with epidemic prevention to eliminate pests and diseases.

In order to realize this plan, the Ruijin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires that the Party committees of all communes strengthen their leadership, not only to focus on industrial and agricultural production, but also on cultural, educational, and health work. The County Committee emphasized that running culture and education should be based on the principle of diligence and thrift, preventing extravagance and waste, paying attention to content, and not paying too much attention to form and equipment.

    瑞金县以实事求是精神制定文教卫生跃进规划
    据新华社南昌4日电　江西省文化先进县——瑞金县人民根据全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议十大倡议中提出的对文化卫生方面的要求，在总结去年大跃进成就和经验的基础上，又以百倍的革命干劲和实事求是的精神，制定了1959年文化卫生方面的跃进计划和措施。
    革命故都瑞金解放前曾经遭受国民党反动派的严重摧残破坏，文化教育和卫生非常落后，有的地区几个村庄找不到一个读书人，疾病严重地威胁着人们的健康。解放后，特别是去年大跃进的一年中，在党和政府的关怀与帮助下，经过人民的艰苦努力，全县的文化教育和卫生事业得到了迅速发展，一跃而为全省的先进县。去年全县已基本扫除文盲，并且村村办起了小学，乡乡办起了业余中学或农业中学。由于群众文化水平提高，农村文艺创作和文娱活动也空前活跃起来了。在卫生方面，多年普遍流行的疟疾、血丝虫病等疾病已经基本消灭。今年，在普及的基础上，全县文化教育工作的重点将转向巩固和提高。加强教学辅导，使所有的业余红专学校、业余中学逐步走向正规，除了农忙的特殊情况以外，切实保证每天有两小时的学习时间。要求到年底全部青壮年达到高小程度，其中30％的人在语文方面具有初中的水平。已经建立的一所艺术学校，主要任务是培养农民导演、演员和文娱活动积极分子，以增强人民公社现有俱乐部、剧团的骨干力量。做到社社有文化馆，队队有图书站。同时，根据群众的需要，篮球、田径等各种体育活动也要普遍开展起来。卫生工作方面，将结合防疫开展一个群众性的除害灭病运动。
    为了实现这个计划，中共瑞金县委要求各公社党委必须加强领导，既要抓好工农业生产，也要抓好文教卫生工作。县委强调办文化教育要本着勤俭的原则，防止铺张浪费，注重内容，而不过分讲求形式和设备。
