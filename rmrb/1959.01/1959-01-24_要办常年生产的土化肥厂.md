Editorial Note:

    The practice of Liangyang County, Guangdong, in actively rectifying its existing 800 factories while vigorously producing local fertilizer, implementing fixed personnel, fixed production quotas, and fixed equipment to gradually transition them to year-round production is correct.

    It is abundantly clear that due to the rapid development of agricultural production, the demand for local fertilizer is increasing, the variety is becoming more complex, and the quality is becoming higher. How can we meet this need? One important method is to shift local fertilizer production from a crash-campaign style to a regular, standardized production; that is to say, we should establish more standardized factories to conduct year-round production. Because: establishing factories can strengthen production planning, can strengthen technological research, and can clarify product specifications and standards, all of which are important for ensuring timely supply and improving fertilizer quality.

    We hope that in areas with a certain foundation in local fertilizer production, under possible conditions, local fertilizer production will gradually shift from a crash basis to a regular basis, to a standardized basis.

    要办常年生产的土化肥厂
    广东两阳县在大造土化肥当中，积极整顿现有的八百个工厂，实行定人、定产、定设备，让它逐步转上常年生产的轨道，这个做法是对的。
    事情十分明显，由于农业生产的飞跃发展，需要的土化肥数量越来越大，品种越来越复杂，质量越来越高。怎样才能满足这个需要呢？重要方法之一，就是使土化肥生产由突击性的生产转上经常性的正规化的生产；也就是说，应该建立更多的正规化的工厂，进行常年的生产。因为：办起了工厂，可以加强生产计划性，可以加强技术研究，可以明确产品规格和标准，这对保证适时供应和提高肥料质量都有重要作用。
    我们希望有一定制土化肥基础的地方，都在可能的条件下，使土化肥生产逐步由突击转入经常，转入正规。
