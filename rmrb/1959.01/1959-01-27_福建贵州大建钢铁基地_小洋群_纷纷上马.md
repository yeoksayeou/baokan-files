Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th – Fujian Province is accelerating the development of steel "small modern groups." This year, the province will build seventy-eight small blast furnaces. Most of the small blast furnaces have already started construction, and some are beginning to produce iron.

During the mass iron and steel campaign in 1958, all parts of the province began to select factory sites, formulate plans, and order equipment based on newly discovered mines and resource conditions, in order to prepare for the launch of the "small modern groups." After the province completed the 1958 steel production task ahead of schedule in November last year, it concentrated more efforts on the construction of the "small modern groups." Based on mineral resources, transportation conditions, and existing industrial infrastructure, the province has selected seventeen steel "small modern group" construction sites along the Yingxia and Nanfu railway lines, including Shunchang, Zhangping, Guokeng, Baisha, Ningde, and Anxi.

At present, the machinery factories in Fuzhou City are actively manufacturing smelting equipment for the "small modern groups." In the first quarter of this year, they will manufacture thirteen sets of complete equipment for 28-cubic-meter small blast furnaces. Most of the equipment for the 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces supplied by Shanghai, as well as the blowers supplied by Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, have been transported to Fujian.

In order to solve the transportation difficulties of ore and fuel needed by the "small modern groups," the transportation department has begun to build railway sidings and highway branches at some "small modern group" construction sites.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 26th – Guizhou Province has begun to vigorously build "small modern group" ironmaking bases, so as to rapidly transition pig iron production from indigenous methods to mechanization.

This year, Guizhou Province plans to establish about 130 small blast furnaces, ranging from 6.5 to 55 cubic meters, in the first quarter. They will be established in groups of five or six, or in clusters of more than ten, in areas with convenient transportation and abundant mineral and coal resources within Zunyi, Anshun, Bijie, and the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. It is estimated that after these small blast furnaces are completed and put into production, they will be able to produce about 1,000 tons of good pig iron for the country every day.

In order to ensure that these small blast furnaces are put into production on schedule, the relevant leading departments of the province have made specific arrangements for the equipment required by each small blast furnace. In addition to all power equipment and larger blast furnace equipment being uniformly solved by the provincial machinery factory, the rest, such as blowers and hot air pipes, are organized and produced by the machinery factories of each special district and county.

While carrying out the basic construction of small blast furnaces intensively, each special district (autonomous prefecture) has also begun to prepare for production, such as training technicians and building highways. Zunyi Special District has established four academic districts centered on Chumi, Shangba, and Guanduhe, and is training more than 2,250 people in batches. The first batch of more than 400 foremen and furnace workers will graduate soon. Anshun, Bijie and other special districts are building highways leading to the "small modern group" bases. Shops, bookstores, and postal and telecommunications institutions that serve workers are also actively preparing to set up.

### 福建贵州大建钢铁基地  “小洋群”纷纷上马

    福建贵州大建钢铁基地
    “小洋群”纷纷上马
    新华社福州26日电　福建省正在加紧发展钢铁“小洋群”。今年全省将建设小高炉七十八座。现在大多数小高炉已经开工，有的正开始出铁。
    在1958年全民大搞钢铁运动的时候，全省各地就开始根据新发现的矿点和资源情况，着手选择厂址、编制计划、订购设备，为小洋群上马进行各项准备工作。去年11月，全省提前完成1958年钢铁生产任务以后，就集中较多的力量从事“小洋群”的建设。根据矿藏资源、交通条件和现有工业基础等情况，全省沿着鹰厦、南福两条铁路线，选定了顺昌、漳平、郭坑、白沙、宁德、安溪等十七个钢铁“小洋群”建设点。
    目前，福州市各机械厂正在积极地为“小洋群”制造冶炼设备，今年第一季度就要制造出十三套二十八立方公尺小高炉的配套设备。上海市供应的十三立方公尺高炉的大部设备，以及由上海、江苏、浙江供应的鼓风机，都已运达福建。
    为了解决“小洋群”所需矿石、燃料的运输困难，交通部门已开始在一些“小洋群”建设点修建铁路专用线和公路支线。
    新华社贵阳26日电　贵州省开始大力建设“小洋群”炼铁基地，好使生铁生产从土法冶炼迅速向机械化过渡。
    今年贵州省计划在第一季度建立六点五到五十五立方公尺的小高炉一百三十座左右。它们都将以五、六个一组，十多个一群，分别建立在遵义、安顺、毕节和黔东南苗族侗族自治州境内交通方便、矿源和煤源丰富的地方。预计这些小高炉建成投入生产后每天能为国家生产一千吨左右的好生铁。
    为了保证这些小高炉按期投入生产，省有关领导部门对各小高炉所需的设备，都早作了具体安排。除所有动力设备和较大的高炉设备由省级机械厂统一解决以外，其余的如鼓风机、热风管等，都由各专区和县机械厂组织生产。
    各专区（州）在紧张进行小高炉基本建设的同时，还开始着手进行培训技术人员、修筑公路等生产准备工作。遵义专区以楚米、上坝和官渡河等地为中心，建立了四个学区，分批对二千二百五十多人进行训练，第一期训练的四百多名值班长和炉前工，不久就要毕业。安顺、毕节等专区，正在修建通往“小洋群”基地的公路。为工人服务的商店、书店和邮电等机构，也在积极筹设中。
