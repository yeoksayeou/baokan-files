　　Be Proactive, Be Prudent!

　　The communes in Hebei Province are carrying out a large-scale high-yield campaign, and many communes in other regions have similar activities. These situations indicate that the vast number of communes are working hard to seize an even greater leap forward this year.

　　Grasping large-scale high yields is indeed an important part of achieving a greater harvest. Last year's Great Leap Forward experience proved that planting large areas of high-yield fields can yield one or several times more than ordinary fields. At the same time, doing a good job in large-scale high-yield fields can also create conditions for gradually realizing a farming system of planting less and harvesting more.

　　However, large-scale high-yield fields are not all farmland after all. Taking the wheat fields in Hebei Province as an example, high-yield fields account for only one-third of all wheat fields. Therefore, while we must grasp large-scale high-yield fields, we must also pay attention to grasping ordinary fields. Because ordinary fields occupy a larger area, and there is not yet sufficient experience in developing large-scale high-yield fields, ordinary farmland needs to continue to serve people for several years alongside large-scale high-yield fields—until the unit area yield is greatly increased and the policy of planting less and harvesting more is universally implemented.

　　Changing the farming system is a major event, and whether it is done well or badly directly affects the interests of 600 million people across the country. We must have both a proactive attitude and take prudent steps in this work. When the unit yield of large areas has not yet stabilized at a very high level, we must not ignore the planting and management of ordinary farmland, let alone reduce the cultivated area too much. It should be increased first and then decreased, that is, strive to increase the unit area yield first, and then reduce the cultivated area; rather than reduce first and then increase, that is, not reduce the cultivated area first, and then increase the unit area yield. This is very important.

    要积极　要稳妥！
    河北省各公社正在开展大面积高产运动，别的地区的许多公社也有类似的活动。这些情况说明，广大公社都在为夺取今年的更大跃进大下功夫。
    抓大面积高产，确是实现更大丰收的重要一环。去年大跃进的经验证明：种好了大面积高产田，可以多收一倍或几倍于一般田的产量。同时，搞好了大面积高产田，还可以为逐步实现少种多收的耕作制度创造条件。
    但是，大面积高产田毕竟不是全部的农田。以河北省的麦田说，高产田不过只占全部麦田的三分之一。因此，我们要抓大面积高产田，也要注意抓一般田。因为一般田的面积更大，而搞大面积高产田目前还没有取得充足的经验，这就需要一般农田伴随着大面积高产田再为人们服务若干年——直到大大提高单位面积产量，普遍实行少种多收的方针以后。
    改变耕作制度是一件大事，做得好或坏，直接关系到全国六亿人民的利害。我们在这个工作中既要有积极的态度，又要采取稳妥的步骤。当大面积单位产量还没有稳定在很高的基础上的时候，绝不能忽视对一般农田的种植和管理，更不能过多地缩减耕地面积。应该是先增后减，就是说，先争取单位面积产量增加，然后再缩小耕地面积；而不是先减后增，就是说，不是先缩小耕地面积，然后增加单位面积产量。这是十分重要的。
