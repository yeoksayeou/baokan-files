Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 14th: According to an Associated Press report, Fidel Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Cuban Provisional Government, demanded that the American military delegation "pack up and leave Cuba as soon as possible." Castro said, "We do not want a mission around that trains an army to defeat us and may engage in espionage activities." Castro made these remarks during a speech at the Havana Lions Club on the 13th.

The report said that in his speech on the 13th, Castro also condemned the malicious attacks by American newspapers on Cuba's execution of Batista criminals. He said, "Why didn't they attack when the Batista government massively executed the people?". Castro stated that Cuban courts are swiftly trying major war criminals and are only executing those who "must be executed to purify this country." Reportedly, recently, American news agencies have been deliberately reporting extensively on the so-called "horrific" scenes of the Cuban Provisional Government executing Batista murderers. US Senator Wayne Morse also attacked the Cuban Provisional Government on the 13th for executing war criminals, calling it a "bloody purge," "inhumane," and "contrary to Christian doctrine."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 13th: The Cuban Provisional Government is beginning to try Batista elements who committed crimes and murders. In Santiago and Camagüey provinces, fifteen military tribunals have begun the aforementioned trial work. According to reports, Cienfuegos, one of the leaders of the Cuban rebel army, emphasized in a conversation with reporters on the 13th that the new government has a moral obligation to execute Batista murderers found guilty of heinous crimes.

The Cuban weekly "Bohemia," published on the 12th, featured hundreds of pictures of the former dictator Batista's horrific atrocities. The magazine said that Batista had killed 20,000 Cuban people during the seven years since he seized power through a coup in 1952.

In other news, 160 bodies of political prisoners killed by Batista were found sixty miles west of Havana on the 11th, causing grief and indignation among local residents.

    卡斯特罗在哈瓦那发表演说
    要美军事代表团尽快离开古巴
    谴责美报对古巴处决战犯的恶意攻击
    新华社14日讯　哈瓦那消息：据美联社报道，古巴临时政府武装部队总司令卡斯特罗要求美国的军事代表团从古巴“卷铺盖，尽快离开”。卡斯特罗说，“不希望在周围有一个训练用来打败我们的军队的和可能进行间谍活动的使团”。卡斯特罗是13日在哈瓦那狮子俱乐部演说时说这番话的。
    消息说，卡斯特罗在13日的演说中还谴责美国报纸对古巴处决巴蒂斯塔罪犯的恶意攻击。他说，“在巴蒂斯塔政府大规模处死人民的时候，它们为什么不进行攻击呢？”。卡斯特罗表示，古巴的法庭正在迅速地审讯重大的战犯，并且只对那些“为了纯洁这个国家”而不得不处死的人才执行死刑。据报道，最近一个时候，美国通讯社曾别有用心地大量报道了古巴临时政府处决巴蒂斯塔杀人犯的所谓“可怖”的情景。美国参议员魏恩·莫尔斯也曾经在13日攻击古巴临时政府处决战犯是“血的清洗”，是“不人道”和“违反基督教义的”。
    新华社13日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府正在开始审判那些犯有罪行的巴蒂斯塔分子杀人犯。在圣地亚哥和卡马圭省，有十五个军事法庭开始了上述审判工作。据报道，古巴起义军领导人之一的西恩富戈斯13日在对记者发表谈话时强调指出，新政府有道德上的义务来处决那些被发现犯有巨大罪行的巴蒂斯塔杀人犯。
    12日出版的古巴周刊“波希米亚”刊载了几百张前独裁者巴蒂斯塔恐怖暴行的图片。这家杂志说，巴蒂斯塔自1952年通过政变攫取政权的七年以来，曾经杀戮了二万古巴人民。
    另有消息说，11日在哈瓦那以西六十英里的地方，曾发现一百六十具被巴蒂斯塔杀害的政治犯的尸体，这一件事引起了当地居民悲愤的情绪。
