Editor's Note:

    To preserve warmth and prevent frost, topdressing and covering with manure are needed; to eliminate weak, yellow, and late-growing seedlings, additional fertilizer should be applied; to satisfy the needs of root consolidation, spring revival, and jointing, continuous topdressing is necessary... The reports on field management of summer crops published today put forward a series of situations related to fertilizer.

    In southern regions with early seasons, wheat and rapeseed have already jointed and bolted, while in regions with later seasons, they will also gradually revive after "Start of Spring." How to seize this short period to prepare sufficient various fertilizers for summer crops and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer for spring crops should be the most important task for all regions at present.

    从田间管理看肥料
    保温、防冻要追肥盖粪；消灭三类苗要加施肥料；满足盘根、返青、拔节，需要不断追肥……。今天发表的夏熟作物田间管理的报道中，提出了一系列和肥料有关的情况。
    季节早的南方地区的小麦、油菜已经拔节、抽苔，季节晚的地区也将在“立春”以后陆续返青。如何抓住这个短暂的时间为夏熟作物准备足够的各种肥料，为春种作物积制大量的肥料，应该是各个地区当前头等重要的事情。
