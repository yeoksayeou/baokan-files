With the realization of the people's commune system, many collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly have been widely built in the vast rural areas. How to do a good job in hygiene in collective life has become one of the important tasks of the people's commune and is also the central task of current rural health work.

Compared with the scattered life of one household and one stove in the past, the hygiene work of collective life in the commune has a more important meaning. In the collective life of the commune, everyone not only works together, but also eats together. There are also nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly. Although children and the elderly often go home, they spend more time in collective activities than in the past. As the opportunities for people to contact each other increase, the chances of spreading diseases also increase. In order to ensure the health of the commune members, and to do a better job of hygiene than in the past when life was scattered, it is necessary not only to ensure that the commune members do not get sick and do not have absences, but also to make them stronger and more energetic. To achieve this, from leaders to the masses, from ideological understanding to specific measures, and from immediate problems to future development, each commune must conduct detailed research and unified arrangements.

Hygiene work in the collective life of the commune is a new and complex task, and it is also a task that requires constant attention. To enable each commune to do a good job in hygiene in collective life, the primary prerequisite is that the party and administrative leading cadres of the commune must truly attach importance to this work. At present, some leading cadres of the commune have insufficient understanding of the importance of hygiene work in collective life. They emphasize production but fail to grasp hygiene work, saying that production is tight and there is no time for hygiene work, pitting production against hygiene, and only arranging production work without arranging hygiene work. This kind of thinking and practice is very harmful.

Doing a good job in commune production and doing a good job in hygiene in the collective life of the commune are essentially two aspects of the same thing. In the final analysis, the development of production in the commune is to continuously improve the lives of the commune members, and doing a good job in hygiene work, so that the commune members are healthy, can better do a good job in production. In the Great Leap Forward, on the steel front, on the agricultural front, and on other fronts, the brilliant achievements created were the results of human labor. Good labor is inseparable from a healthy body. Some commune members said: "Health is the capital of production, and being free from disease is the guarantee of the Great Leap Forward." It can be seen that doing a good job in hygiene in collective life is not only necessary for production, but also a universal requirement of the vast number of commune members. The Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party clearly pointed out: "When the Party leads the work of the commune, it must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, production, and life. It must care about people and correct the tendency to see things but not people. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses. The more the Party cares about the lives of the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses will be. The view that pitting production against life, and believing that paying attention to the lives of the masses will hinder production, is wrong." This resolution also requires that public canteens should ensure that commune members "eat their fill, eat well, and eat cleanly and hygienically." It can be seen that doing a good job in hygiene is a very important aspect of doing a good job in life. Moreover, it should also be noted that at present, it is the busy season of winter production in the countryside, with large-scale water conservancy construction, crash accumulation of fertilizer, deep plowing of land, field management of overwintering crops, and large-scale sideline production. Some places also need to smelt iron, smelt steel, and mine coal. Labor is intense. At this time, it is even more necessary to pay attention to hygiene work. As long as the commune party committee leaders take hygiene work seriously and mobilize everyone to do it, then the hygiene workers will be more active and proactive in carrying out their work, and the cooks and childcare workers will also realize their glorious responsibilities, actively learn hygiene knowledge, and find ways to do a good job in hygiene. Only then can the vast number of commune members use their brains and come up with various methods to do a good job in hygiene. Countless examples have proven that the commune that does a good job in hygiene has healthy commune members, and the commune members' production enthusiasm is more and more sufficient, and work efficiency is significantly improved.

In order to do a good job in the hygiene of the commune's collective life, effective measures must also be taken in various aspects. At present, the most urgent task is to do a good job in the prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases. Now it is winter, and soon it will be spring, which is the time when various diseases are prone to occur. In densely populated construction sites, production teams, public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, efforts must be made to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. Where they occur, they must be vigorously eliminated to prevent their spread. At the same time, it is necessary to combine the rectification of the commune to improve medical and health institutions, unite Chinese and Western medicine, and expand the medical team. It is required to be able to detect the epidemic situation in time, carry out isolation treatment in time, prevent infection, and truly achieve "early diagnosis, early detection, and early treatment." For the convenience of treatment, the commune can also set up simple hospital beds according to specific conditions.

Seriously and quickly training and cultivating cooks and childcare workers is an important part of doing a good job in collective hygiene. In order to solve this problem, not only must the existing cooks and childcare workers be trained and improved, but also those among party members, league members, and activists who are suitable for this work should be selected for training. The trained cooks should gradually be able to "be both cooks and health workers," making a variety of dishes, and also understanding some nutritional knowledge and food hygiene. Childcare workers can also gradually "be both childcare workers and nurses," knowing how to take care of children, and also knowing some children's hygiene knowledge, ensuring the healthy development of children. In the current situation where cooks and childcare workers cannot immediately meet the requirements, some places have adopted the method of systematically assigning trained young cooks and childcare workers to work in various public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, leading those who have not yet been trained and the elderly. This is a practical and feasible method. Various places can adopt different methods to solve this problem according to their specific circumstances.

The patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, pay attention to hygiene, and eliminate diseases is still a regular task of the commune's hygiene work. To do a good job in this, it is necessary to combine the shock campaign with the regular work, the symptomatic treatment with the fundamental solution, and the mass movement with science and technology, and constantly enrich the content of the patriotic health campaign and improve the level of the movement. Through the movement, change the personal hygiene of the commune members, as well as the environmental hygiene of public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, villages, and production sites, and prevent the occurrence of diseases.

In order to comprehensively and thoroughly do a good job in the commune's hygiene work, there is still much work to be done. The party and administrative leaders of the commune need to plan according to the needs and possibilities of the commune members, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and gradually doing it. In particular, hygiene work involving the commune's basic construction and production planning, such as the adjustment of residential areas, the distribution design of drinking water wells, toilets, and livestock pens, and the construction of kitchens, dining halls, dormitories, and bathhouses, etc., all need to be considered by the commune as a whole. Therefore, to solve the hygiene problems of the entire commune, it must be regarded as one of the important contents of the current rectification of the people's commune. In the rectification of the commune, the hygiene situation of the commune should be carefully checked, and practical measures should be taken to quickly improve it, especially to do a good job in the hygiene of collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly. The grassroots hygiene workers must, under the leadership of the commune party organization and administrative leaders, give full play to their initiative and creativity, and do a good job in public hygiene and the personal hygiene of the commune members, so that the vast number of commune members are healthy and ensure the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

### 做好集体生活中的卫生工作

    做好集体生活中的卫生工作
    随着人民公社化的实现，广大农村普遍兴建了许多公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园以及敬老院等集体福利事业。如何做好集体生活中的卫生工作，已成为当前人民公社的重要工作之一，也是当前农村卫生工作的中心任务。
    比起过去一户一灶的时候的分散生活，公社集体生活的卫生工作有着更加重要的意义。在公社的集体生活中，大家不仅劳动在一起，吃饭也在一起。还有托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院，小孩和老人虽然经常回家里去，但是集中活动的时间比过去多多了。人与人接触的机会多了，传染疾病的机会也增多了。为了保证社员的健康，为了把卫生工作做得比过去分散生活时更好，不但要做到社员不害病，不缺勤，而且要使他们愈益身强体壮，愈益精神奋发。要做到这点，必须从领导到群众、从思想认识到具体措施、从眼前的问题到将来的发展，每个公社都要作详细的研究和统一的安排。
    公社集体生活的卫生工作是一项新的复杂的工作，也是一项需要经常注意的工作。要使每个公社都能做好集体生活的卫生工作，首要的前提就是公社的党和行政领导干部，要切切实实地重视这项工作。目前有些公社的领导干部对集体生活卫生工作的重要性认识不足，他们强调了生产，不抓卫生工作，说生产紧张，没有工夫搞卫生工作，把生产与卫生对立起来，只安排生产工作，不安排卫生工作。这种想法和做法是十分有害的。
    搞好公社生产，和搞好公社的集体生活中的卫生工作，实质上是一件事情的两个方面。归根到底，公社发展生产是为了不断改善社员的生活，而做好卫生工作，使社员身体健康，就可以更好地搞好生产。在大跃进中，在钢铁战线上，在农业战线上，在其他各个战线上所创造出来的辉煌成就，都是人的劳动成果。好劳动是同健康的身体分不开的。有的社员说：“健康是生产的资本，无病是跃进的保证”。可见，做好集体生活的卫生工作，不仅是生产所必需，也是广大社员普遍的要求。在党的八届六中全会所通过的关于人民公社若干问题的决议中，明确指出：“党在领导公社工作的时候，必须注意全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活。必须关心人，纠正那种见物不见人的倾向。群众的干劲越大，党越要关心群众生活。党越是关心群众生活，群众的干劲也会越大。把生产和生活对立起来，认为重视群众生活就会妨碍生产的观点，是错误的。”这个决议还要求公共食堂应该做到使社员“吃得饱、吃得好，吃得干净卫生”。可见搞好卫生工作是搞好生活的一个十分重要的方面。而且还应该注意到，目前正是农村冬季生产繁忙的时候，大修水利，突击积肥、深翻土地、过冬作物田间管理，大搞副业，有一些地方还要炼铁、炼钢、采煤，劳动是紧张的。在这个时候，更有必要重视卫生工作。只要公社党委负责干部切实抓起卫生工作，发动大家去干，那末卫生工作人员会更积极主动地去进行工作，而炊事员和保育员们也会认识到自己的光荣的职责，积极学习卫生知识，想办法做好卫生工作，广大社员也才能开动脑筋，想出各种办法，把卫生工作做好。无数事例证明：哪个公社卫生工作做得好，社员身体健康，哪个公社的社员的生产劲头就越鼓越足，工作效率就显著提高。
    为了把公社的集体生活卫生工作做好，还要从各方面采取有效的措施。目前最迫切的是做好冬春季传染病的防治工作。现在是冬令，转眼又是春天，正是各种疾病容易发生的时候。在人口聚集的工地、生产队，以及公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院，必须努力防止传染病的发生，发生了的地方就要大力扑灭，防止蔓延。与此同时要结合整社健全医疗保健机构，团结中西医，扩大医疗队伍。要求能够做到及时发现疫情，及时进行隔离治疗，防止传染，真正达到“早期诊断、早期发现和早期治疗”。为了治疗的方便，公社还可根据具体条件，设立简易病床。
    认真地迅速地训练和培养炊事员和保育员，是做好集体卫生工作的重要的一环。为了解决这个问题，不仅要对现有炊事员、保育员进行训练提高，而且要选择党员、团员和积极分子中适合于担负这一工作的人加以训练。应该使经过训练的炊事员，能逐步做到“是炊事员又是保健员”，使他们会做多种多样的饭菜，也懂得些营养常识和饮食卫生。保育员也能逐步做到“是保育员又是护理员”，既懂得带孩子，也懂得一些幼儿卫生常识，保证幼儿健康地发育。在目前炊事员、保育员都还不能马上满足要求的情况下，有些地方采取有计划地分配经过训练的年轻的炊事员和保育员，到各公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园去工作，带动还没经过训练的和年老的人，这是一个切实可行的办法。各地可以根据具体情况，采取不同的方法解决这个问题。
    对于除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的爱国卫生运动，这仍然是公社卫生工作的经常任务。要把它做好，必须把突击与经常、治标与治本、群众运动与科学技术结合起来，不断地充实爱国卫生运动的内容，提高运动的水平。通过运动，改变社员个人卫生，以及公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、村落以及生产现场的环境卫生，防止疾病的发生。
    为了全面而彻底地做好公社的卫生工作，还有许多工作要做，需要公社党和行政的领导干部根据社员需要与可能，有计划地分清轻重缓急，逐步地做起来，特别是牵涉到公社基本建设和生产规划的卫生工作，如居民点的调整，饮水井、厕所、畜圈等的分布设计，厨房、饭厅、宿舍以及澡塘的兴建等等，均需公社加以全盘考虑。因此，要解决整个公社的卫生工作问题，必须把它作为当前人民公社整社的重要内容之一。在整社中，要把公社的卫生情况认真检查，采取切实的措施，迅速加以改善，特别要把公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业的卫生工作办好。基层的卫生工作人员必须在公社党组织和行政领导下，充分发挥主动性和创造性，搞好公共卫生和社员个人卫生，使广大社员身体健康，保证实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
