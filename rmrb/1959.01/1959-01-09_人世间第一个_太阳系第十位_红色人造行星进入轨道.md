Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th: TASS Moscow, January 7th: TASS science reporter reports: The first artificial planet in the solar system entered orbit on the 7th.

Since the historical moment of January 2nd, 20:00 Moscow time (January 3rd, 01:00 Beijing time), when the Soviet Union launched the cosmic rocket, the cosmic rocket has traveled 14.5 million kilometers in interplanetary space, flying about one million kilometers away from the Earth (straight-line distance). The latter number will increase extremely rapidly, because the Earth and the artificial planet are moving farther and farther apart in the universe.

The tenth planet is much closer to Mars than to Earth, because the lunar rocket greatly exceeded the second cosmic velocity at launch. However, Soviet scientists predict that the Earth and the tenth planet may re-approach within a relatively close distance, which will allow people to observe the rocket accordingly in the distant future.

One week later (January 14th), the first artificial planet will reach its perihelion – the point on its orbit closest to the sun (146.4 million kilometers). At that time, it will reach its maximum speed – more than 32 kilometers per second. Afterward, as it approaches the aphelion of its orbit, its speed will also decrease, averaging 27.75 kilometers per second.

The selection of the date for launching the Soviet cosmic rocket towards the moon was not accidental. In early January, the moon was at one of its closest points to Earth on its orbit (368,000 kilometers). This was the beginning of the last quarter of the sun-moon (last quarter – translator's note), when the moon seemed to traverse the Earth's path, which was traveling at a speed of about 30 kilometers per second. Therefore, the orbit of the cosmic rocket almost completely coincided with the direction of the Earth's orbit around the sun, and the rocket itself could gain an extra speed of about 30 kilometers per second beyond the second cosmic velocity.

The selection of the launch time and direction was also not accidental. The rocket was launched shortly before the moon rose from the east. Therefore, the rocket launched in this direction gained an extra speed due to the Earth's rotation. It is worth recalling that the first communiqué on the cosmic rocket mentioned that the rocket crossed the eastern border of the Soviet Union.

Some foreign scientists insist that Soviet experts did not choose the launch date completely appropriately, and that it would be more advantageous to launch during the new moon period. This statement is difficult to agree with. Of course, launching a rocket during the last quarter of the sun-moon requires more complex and precise calculations. However, these calculations have been fully proven correct. Soviet scientists did not propose the task of landing on the moon, just as the Americans did not propose this task.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 8th: Soviet physics and mathematics associate Dr. Orlov published an article in "Labor Daily" today, saying that the future orbit of the Soviet cosmic rocket will have some minor changes, but the shape and position of the orbit are almost fixed.

Orlov said that the environment around the cosmic rocket has an impact on the rocket's orbit, but this impact is also negligible. Therefore, the lifespan of the rocket will actually be infinite. It may encounter meteorite impacts, but small meteorites will not have any impact on the rocket, and the possibility of encountering large meteorites is extremely small. Therefore, the possibility of the rocket being destroyed by meteorites practically does not exist. Like all celestial bodies orbiting along an orbit, the speed of the rocket will also change. At perihelion (the point on the orbit closest to the sun), the rocket's speed is about 32 kilometers per second, and at aphelion, its speed is about 24 kilometers per second.

Xinhua News Agency, January 7th: According to TASS, Academician Skobeltsyn, a famous Soviet scientist, wrote in "Pravda" on the 6th that due to the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket, unprecedented new possibilities have emerged in exploring the vast depths of outer space.

Skobeltsyn said that observations made with cosmic rockets far away from the Earth and outside the Earth's magnetic field can provide extremely valuable materials for solving many problems that we are urgently concerned about. He also pointed out that the observations of cosmic rays and other radiations in outer space that have been carried out and are planned to be carried out in the near future are only a beginning, only part of a broad scientific exploration plan based on artificial Earth satellites and solar satellites that may be realized in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 7th: Corresponding Academician Koshtoyants of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published an article in "Pravda" on the 6th, saying that under the level of modern science and technology, mankind can overcome the difficulties of physiological conditions not being suitable for survival in outer space, thereby entering the vast universe.

The scientist wrote that the first people who may appear on the moon or other planets will go there on specially made spacecraft. These spacecraft should consider installing equipment that can create all the conditions in which basic physiological processes are very adaptable. This type of spacecraft will be a "small Earth" that is in constant contact with the large Earth. On this type of spacecraft, there should be many devices that allow people to feel like they are living at home and can conduct observations in it.

    人世间第一个　太阳系第十位
    红色人造行星进入轨道
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日电：塔斯社科学记者报道：第一个太阳系人造行星7日已经进入轨道。
    自从1月2日莫斯科时间二十时（北京时间3日清晨一时）这个历史时刻，苏联发射了宇宙火箭以后，宇宙火箭在行星际空间走了一千四百五十万公里，飞离地球约一百万公里（直线距离）。后一个数字将极其迅速地增长，因为地球和人造行星在宇宙中正越离越远。
    第十个行星离火星的距离比离地球近得多，这是由于月球火箭在发射时大大超过了第二宇宙速度。可是苏联科学家预言地球同第十行星有可能在较近的距离内重新接近，这个距离可以使人们能在遥远的将来对火箭进行相应的观测。
    在一个星期以后（1月14日），第一个人造行星将到达自己的近日点——轨道上离太阳最近之点（一亿四千六百四十万公里）。那时它将达到最高速度——每秒钟三十二公里以上。以后，随着它接近于远日点轨道上，它的速度也将减少，平均为每秒钟二十七·七五公里。
    向月球方向发射苏联宇宙火箭日期的选定不是偶然的。1月初，月球正处在它的轨道上离地球最近点之一（三十六万八千公里）。这就是太阳月最后四分之一的开始时刻（下弦—译注），这时月球好像横越过每秒钟约三十公里的速度飞行的地球的道路。因此，宇宙火箭的轨道差不多是同地球绕太阳运行的方向完全吻合的，而火箭本身就在第二宇宙速度之外可以额外获得每秒钟约三十公里的速度。
    发射时刻和方向的选择也不是偶然的。火箭是在月球从东方升起之前不久发射的。因此向这个方向发射的火箭由于地球自转而又获得了一笔额外速度。这里提醒一下，在关于宇宙火箭的第一次公报中就提到，火箭越过了苏联东部边境。
    有些外国的科学家硬说，苏联专家发射火箭的日期选择得不完全恰当，又说在新月时期发射更为有利，这种说法是难于同意的。当然，在太阳月的最后四分之一时期发射火箭需要更复杂、更精确的计算。可是这些计算完全被证实是正确的。苏联科学家没有提出在月球上着陆的任务，正如美国人没有提出这个任务一样。
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联物理数学家奥尔洛夫副博士今天在“劳动报”上发表文章说，苏联宇宙火箭今后的运行轨道会有某些微小的改变，但轨道的形状和位置几乎是固定的。
    奥尔洛夫说，宇宙火箭周围的环境对火箭的轨道有影响，但这种影响也是微不足道的。因此火箭的寿命实际上将是无限长的。它可能会遇上流星的撞击，但微小的流星体对火箭不会有任何影响，遇到大流星的可能性是极小的，因此火箭被流星撞毁的可能性在实际上是不会存在的。和一切沿着轨道运行的天体一样，火箭运行的速度也会有所改变，在近日点（轨道上离太阳最近之点）时火箭运行速度约为每秒三十二公里，在远日点时，它的速度约为每秒二十四公里。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联著名科学家斯科贝尔琴院士6日在“真理报”撰文说，由于苏联宇宙火箭的发射成功，在考察宇宙空间辽远的深处方面出现了从来未有过的新可能性。
    斯科贝尔琴说，用宇宙火箭在离地球很远的地方、在地球磁场以外进行的观测，可以为解决我们所迫切关心的许多问题提供极珍贵的材料。他还指出已进行的和预定在最近进行的对宇宙线和宇宙空间其他辐射的观测，只不过是一个开始，只不过是在最近可能实现的以人造地球卫星和太阳卫星为基础的广泛科学考察计划的一部分。
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联科学院通讯院士科什托扬茨6日在“真理报”发表文章说，在现代科学技术水平的情况下，人类可以克服生理条件不适于在宇宙空间生存的困难，从而进入广阔的宇宙中。
    这位科学家写道，第一批可能出现在月球上或者其他行星上的人，将是乘特制的宇宙飞船去的，在这些宇宙飞船上应当考虑装上一些能够创造基本生理过程都非常适应的一切条件的设备。这种飞船将是同大地球有经常联系的“小地球”。在这种飞船上，应当有许多设备使人们在里头能感到像生活在家里一样，并能在其中进行观测。
