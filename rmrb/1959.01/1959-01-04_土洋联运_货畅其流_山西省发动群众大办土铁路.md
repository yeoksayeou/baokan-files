Local and Foreign Transportation Combined: Smooth Flow of Goods
Shanxi Province Mobilizes the Masses to Vigorously Build Local Railways

This dispatch from Taiyuan, January 3rd: (Reporter Guo Jie) To pave the way for the steel marshal, Shanxi Province has mobilized the masses to vigorously build local railways, and a high tide has emerged. In some areas where construction started earlier, the earthwork construction of the roadbed has been completed, and eleven local railways with a total length of 22.2 kilometers have been officially opened to traffic.

Currently, all localities are generally mobilizing the masses to adopt the method of planning, surveying, designing, and constructing simultaneously to speed up the progress of the project. More than 240 kilometers of local railways throughout the province have been fully started. Every day, more than 82,000 people are投入ing in building roadbeds, laying tracks, and rushing to build carriages. Many places have also planned labor specifically for building local railways. At present, in addition to more than 240 kilometers of local railways that have been started, more than 600 kilometers have begun topographic surveys.

Shanxi Province has developed 89 small and medium-sized iron and steel bases. With the large-scale construction of iron and steel bases and the rapid development of steel production, the transportation volume in various places has surged, and the transportation volume is large, the number of loading and unloading times is large, and the transportation distance is short. The existing modern railways and highways are obviously not enough to meet the needs of this production development. This year, the transportation volume of coal and iron will increase nearly tenfold compared with last year. Therefore, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed a plan to build 2,000 kilometers of local railways in the province in the past winter and this year to establish a local railway transportation network connecting mines and factories in all directions. After the meeting, various localities, according to the distribution of local iron and steel bases and the transfer lines of mineral resources, formulated specific plans for building more than 2,000 kilometers of local railways, and decided to complete 300 kilometers this spring.

At present, the local railways being built in Shanxi Province are divided into three categories. First, the connection between mines and factories; second, the connection between industrial bases and foreign railways; third, self-use within mines. In order to enable local railways to be put into production quickly, all localities have made specific plans and queuing according to the requirements of current production development and economic value, giving priority to urgency. Generally, in response to the urgent situation of ore and coke needed for the construction of iron and steel bases, the railways leading to coal areas and mining areas centered on the iron and steel bases are first selected for construction. In addition, there are also a small number of underground local railways in coal mines and temporary local railways at some water conservancy project sites.

"Combining local and foreign methods, and joint local and foreign transportation" makes local railways assistants to foreign railways, connecting industrial bases and foreign railways, which is a feature of the construction of local railways in various parts of Shanxi Province. In the areas where the Datong-Puzhou Railway running across the north and south of the province, the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway going east, and the Zhanjiang-Dongguan Railway under construction pass, local railways generally adopt connecting with foreign railways, or connecting the two local railways through a section of foreign train transportation. The foreign railway stations of iron and steel bases such as Linfen and Hongdong in southern Shanxi have become the central hub stations of local railways. In order to "combine local and foreign transportation", the relevant departments of Shanxi Province recently formulated technical standards for local railways based on the local railway situation that has been opened to traffic in various places. Some local railways connected to industrial bases and foreign railways have formulated the same track gauge as foreign railways according to the principles of economic rationality and applicability, so that local trains can enter foreign railway platforms to load and unload materials for joint transportation.

The mass movement to build local railways in various places has adopted local methods to overcome difficulties in manufacturing locomotives, tracks, etc. At present, the locomotives manufactured in various places include those converted from scrapped locomotives, and those converted from gas engines, portable steam engines, and car heads. The trial effect is very good. The steam locomotive manufactured by Linfen Machinery Factory was converted from a 100-horsepower portable steam engine. In addition to the boiler and wheels, they designed and manufactured 23 sets of cylinders, tie rods, and crescent plates, totaling more than 300 parts. This locomotive has a traction capacity of more than 100 tons and travels at more than 20 kilometers per hour. In order to overcome the brittleness of pig iron rails, various places have adopted the method of heating treatment again after casting and encrypting sleepers to solve the problem. The pressure per kilogram of this heat-treated local track reaches more than 10 to 15 kilograms.

Local railways are very popular in various parts of Shanxi. Because local railways are easy to build, take a short time, open to traffic quickly, and the construction cost is only one-tenth of that of building foreign railways. Once the railway is opened to traffic, it not only increases the freight volume and meets the supply of iron ore and coal needed by the steel base, but also replaces the transportation of a large number of cars, horse carts and pack animals, and also liberates a large amount of labor.

    土洋联运　货畅其流
    山西省发动群众大办土铁路
    本报太原3日电　记者郭洁报道：为钢铁元帅铺道开路，山西省发动群众大办土铁路，已出现高潮。部分动工较早的地区，已完成路基土方建设工程，并有十一条全长二十二点二公里的土铁路正式通车。
    目前，各地普遍发动群众采取边规划、边勘测、边设计、边施工的办法，加快工程进度，全省已有二百四十多公里土铁路全面动工修筑。每天，有八万二千多人投入了修筑路基、铺设轨道和赶制车厢。不少地方还规划了专门修筑土铁路的劳动力。现在，全省除了二百四十多公里土铁路已开工修筑外，还有六百多公里开始进行地形勘测。
    山西省各地已经发展起八十九个中小型钢铁基地。随着钢铁基地大规模的建设和钢铁生产的飞跃发展，各地运输量激增，而且运量大、装卸次数多，运距较短，已有的现代化铁路和公路显然不能满足这一生产发展的需要。今年煤、铁的运输量将要比去年增加近十倍。因此，中共山西省委提出了全省在去冬和今年一年多时间内要修筑二千公里土铁路的规划，建立接连矿山和工厂四通八达的土铁路运输网。会议以后，各地根据当地钢铁基地的分布状况和矿产资源的调运线路，制订了修筑两千多公里土铁路的具体规划，并决定今春完成三百公里。
    目前，山西省兴修的土铁路分三类。即一、矿山和工厂联结的；二、工业基地和洋铁路联结的；三、矿山内自用的。各地为使土铁路很快通车投入生产，都按照当前发展生产的要求和经济价值分别轻重缓急进行了具体规划和排队。一般都针对钢铁基地建设所需矿石、焦炭的急迫状况，首先选择了先建以钢铁基地为中心通往煤区、矿区的铁路。此外，还有一小部分是煤矿井下土铁路和少数水利工程工地的临时性土铁路。
    “土洋结合、土洋联运”，使土铁路成为洋铁路的助手，把工业基地和洋铁路联结起来，是山西省各地兴建土铁路的一个特点。在横贯全省南北的同蒲铁路和东去的石太铁路，以及正在兴建的詹东铁路，大洋铁路干线经过的地方，土铁路一般都采取和洋铁路连轨，或者通过一段洋火车运输，把两条土铁路接连起来。晋南地区的临汾、洪洞等钢铁基地的洋铁路车站，都成了土铁路的中心枢纽站。为了“土洋联运”，山西省有关部门最近根据各地已通车的土铁路情况，制订了土铁路技术标准，一部分工业基地和洋铁路联结的土铁路，都根据经济合理适用的原则，制定了和洋铁路同样的轨距，使土火车可进入洋火车站台去装卸物资，进行联运。
    各地发动群众大搞土铁路的运动，采取土办法上马克服制造机车、路轨等方面的困难。目前，各地制造的机车中，有用废旧机车改装的，也有用煤气机、锅驼机和汽车头改装的。试用效果很好。临汾机械制造厂制造的蒸气机车，就是用一部一百马力锅驼机改装的，其中除了锅炉和车轮外，他们自己设计和制造了二十三套汽缸、拉杆和月牙板等零件共三百多个。这个机车牵引能力达一百多吨，每小时行驶二十多公里。为了克服生铁铸轨发脆的困难，各地采取浇铸以后再加热处理一次和加密枕木的办法加以解决。这种加热之后的土道轨，每公斤承受的压力达到十至十五公斤以上。
    山西各地对土铁路都很欢迎。因为土铁路修建容易、时间短、通车快，而且修建成本仅等于修筑洋铁路的十分之一。铁路一通车，不但增大了货运量，满足了钢铁基地所需要的铁矿和煤的供应，而且代替了大批汽车、马车和驮畜的运输，也解放了大批劳动力。（附图片）
