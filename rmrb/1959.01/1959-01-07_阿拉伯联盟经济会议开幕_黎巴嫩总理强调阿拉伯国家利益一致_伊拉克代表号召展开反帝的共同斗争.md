Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 6th: The Fifth Conference of the Arab League Economic Committee opened in Cairo on the afternoon of the 5th.

Nine of the ten member states of the League sent representatives to the meeting; Tunisia's representative was absent. Kuwait sent observers. The committee had invited observers from Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait to attend the meeting, but the first two countries did not send observers.

Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna emphasized the importance of economic unity among Arab countries in his opening speech. He expressed hope that Arab countries would be able to sign an economic unity agreement, and that those countries that had not signed the economic unity agreement would be able to sign a financial organization agreement.

Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the UAR, Okheler, in his capacity as chairman of the previous committee meeting, announced the end of the fourth committee meeting and suggested that the chairmanship of this meeting be held by the head of the UAR delegation, UAR Minister of Economy, Keshouqi. Keshouqi spoke at the meeting and suggested that the head of the Lebanese delegation, Lebanese Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Karami, serve as chairman.

Karami said in his speech that the most important thing for Arab countries is "the unity of goals and interests, which makes us all sit here and work together to achieve our goals."

The head of the Iraqi delegation, Minister of Economy Kubba, said at the meeting that the imperialists realized that Arab unity is the most reliable guarantee against imperialist conspiracies and imperialist interests. That is why the imperialists are trying to undermine Arab unity by spreading false news and separating Iraq from the rest of the Arab world. But in fact, the unity between Iraq and the Arab world is very solid. This can be proved by the signing of military, cultural and economic agreements between Iraq and the UAR.

Kubba also said that Iraq opposes and condemns the policies of the imperialists and their agents, and it will always support the Arab struggle. He emphasized that the so-called Iraqi departure from Arab nationalism is an imperialist conspiracy.

Regarding Iraq's foreign policy, he said that Iraq pursues a policy of active neutrality and the Bandung principles. He said that Arab countries must launch a joint struggle against imperialism.

Kubba said that the realization of the best form of Arab common market depends on the realization of democratic political relations among free Arab countries.

He also said that the Arab unity issue "should not be simplified to the extent that the special circumstances of each Arab country are ignored." He said that all Arab countries hope for unity, and they can strive for it in different ways because they have different situations.

Finally, he called on Arab countries to eliminate imperialism and free their economies from imperialist exploitation.

When the head of the UAR delegation, Keshouqi, spoke, he expressed his approval of the committee's agenda. He said that he would like to take this opportunity to assure Iraq that the UAR does not attach importance to the imperialist attempts to create discord between the UAR and Iraq. The UAR will always advance together with Arab brothers to seek the common interests of the Arab people.

The meeting then began a closed-door session.

The three subcommittees established by the Arab League Economic Committee meeting on the 5th began to hold meetings on the 6th. One is discussing economic issues, one is discussing financial issues, and the other is discussing boycotting Israel and oil issues. These three subcommittees will submit reports to the Economic Committee.

    阿拉伯联盟经济会议开幕
    黎巴嫩总理强调阿拉伯国家利益一致
    伊拉克代表号召展开反帝的共同斗争
    新华社开罗6日电　阿拉伯联盟经济委员会第五次会议5日下午在开罗开幕。
    参加联盟的十个成员国中的九国派代表出席了会议，突尼斯的代表缺席。科威特派观察员列席了会议。委员会曾经邀请巴林、卡塔尔和科威特等三个国家的观察员列席会议，但是前两个国家的观察员没有来。
    阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳在开幕会议上讲话时强调阿拉伯国家之间经济统一的重要性。他表示希望阿拉伯国家将能签署经济统一协定，并且希望那些没有签署经济统一协定的国家能够签署财政组织协定。
    沙特阿拉伯驻阿联大使奥克赫勒以上次委员会会议主席的身份宣布第四次委员会会议结束，并建议这一次会议主席由阿联代表团团长、阿联经济部长凯舒尼担任。凯舒尼在会上发言，建议由黎巴嫩代表团团长、黎巴嫩总理兼经济部长卡拉米担任主席。
    卡拉米在会议上讲话时说，对阿拉伯国家来说，最重要的东西是
  “目标和利益的一致，这种一致使得我们大家坐在这里一起工作，以达到我们的目标”。
    伊拉克代表团团长、经济部长库巴在会议上说，帝国主义者意识到阿拉伯人的团结是反对帝国主义阴谋和帝国主义利益的最可靠保证。这就是帝国主义者用散布虚伪消息的办法尽力破坏阿拉伯团结，使伊拉克和阿拉伯世界其他国家割裂开来的缘故，但事实上伊拉克和阿拉伯世界的团结是非常巩固的。这一点可以从伊拉克和阿联签订军事、文化、经济协定这件事情得到证明。
    库巴还说，伊拉克反对和谴责帝国主义者和他们的代理人的政策，它永远支持阿拉伯的斗争。他强调指出，所谓伊拉克脱离阿拉伯民族主义的说法是帝国主义的阴谋。
    关于伊拉克的外交政策，他说，伊拉克奉行积极中立政策和万隆原则。他说，阿拉伯国家必须展开反对帝国主义的共同斗争。
    库巴说，最好形式的阿拉伯共同市场的实现，取决于自由阿拉伯国家之间政治上的民主关系的实现。
    他还说，阿拉伯统一问题“不应当简单化到忽视每个阿拉伯国家的特殊情况的程度”。他说，所有的阿拉伯国家都希望统一，他们可以用不同的方式去争取，因为它们有不同的情况。
    最后，他号召阿拉伯国家消灭帝国主义，并且使它们的经济摆脱帝国主义的剥削。
    阿联代表团团长凯舒尼发言时，表示赞成委员会的议程。他说他要借这个机会向伊拉克保证，阿联对帝国主义企图在阿联和伊拉克之间制造不和的尝试并不重视。阿联将永远同阿拉伯弟兄一起为谋求阿拉伯人民的利益共同前进。
    会议随后开始举行秘密会议。
    阿拉伯联盟经济委员会会议5日晚上决定设立的三个小组委员会已在6日开始举行会议。一个讨论经济问题，一个讨论财政问题，另一个是讨论抵制以色列和石油问题。这三个小组委员会将向经济委员会提出报告。
