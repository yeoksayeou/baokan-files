    Jewel Flower Fabric
    The Shanghai State-Owned No. 5 Printing and Dyeing Factory has recently produced a "Jewel Flower Fabric." This fabric can emit brilliant and dazzling starlight. Clothes made from it are very gorgeous and unique.
    How exactly do the jewels get onto the fabric? It turns out that the printing and dyeing workers take colored chemical plastics, add glitter powder, luminous powder, or embed diamond beads, and make them into small round beads. They then use a high-heat calendering method to melt them into the fabric fibers.
