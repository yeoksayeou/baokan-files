Vice Premier Chen Yi's Speech

Respectable Premier Comrade, respectable comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, comrades, friends:

With boundless reluctance to part, we are here today to bid farewell to our respected friend, Comrade Premier Grotewohl, and all the comrades of the delegation. At this moment of parting, I once again, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, express our deep gratitude for your gracious visit, for bringing the profound friendship of the German people to the Chinese people, and for your valuable contributions to further strengthening and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

We are pleased to see that over the past few years, the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples have been developing satisfactorily. We are particularly grateful to the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic for the sincere assistance they have given to our socialist construction. The North China Radio Equipment Factory and the Beijing Glass Factory, which the delegation visited in Beijing, were both established with the help of German comrades. The Dongba Management Station in Chaoyang District, Beijing, which the delegation visited, has been renamed the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune. These few concrete examples alone vividly reflect the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. The joint statement issued by our two governments this time and the consular treaty signed mark that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are entering a stage of comprehensive development.

Premier Comrade and comrades of the delegation: During your stay in Beijing, you were warmly welcomed everywhere by the Chinese people from the bottom of their hearts. This welcome expressed the Chinese people's boundless love and support for the fraternal German people. We hope that after you return home, you will bring this most sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the heroic German people, so that the fraternal relations between our two peoples will continue to be consolidated and developed. Finally, I sincerely wish you good health and a safe journey.

    在机场欢送德意志民主共和国代表团
    陈毅副总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们同志们，朋友们：
    我们怀着无限惜别的心情，在这里欢送我们敬爱的朋友，格罗提渥总理同志和代表团的全体同志们。在这临别的时刻，我再一次代表中国政府和中国人民深深地感谢你们的盛情访问，感谢你们为中国人民带来了德国人民的深厚友情，感谢你们对进一步加强和发展我们两国之间的友好合作关系作出了宝贵的贡献。
    我们高兴地看到，过去几年中，我们两国人民的友谊和合作一直在令人满意地发展着。我们特别感激德意志民主共和国政府和人民在我国社会主义建设事业中所给予我们的真诚援助。这次代表团在北京参观过的华北无线电器材厂和北京玻璃厂都是在德国同志帮助下建立起来的。代表团访问过的北京市朝阳区东坝管理站已经命名为中德友好人民公社。仅仅就眼前的这几个具体例子来说，它已最生动不过地反映了我们两国人民兄弟般的友谊和合作。至于这次我们两国政府发表的联合声明和签订的领事条约，更标志着我们两国的友好合作关系正在进入一个全面发展的阶段。
    总理同志和代表团的同志们：你们在北京停留期间，到处受到了中国人民发自衷心的热情欢迎，这种欢迎表达了中国人民对兄弟的德国人民的无限热爱和支持。希望你们回国以后，把中国人民这种最诚挚的友谊带给英勇的德国人民，使我们两国人民的兄弟关系不断地巩固和发展。最后，衷心地祝你们身体健康，一路平安。
