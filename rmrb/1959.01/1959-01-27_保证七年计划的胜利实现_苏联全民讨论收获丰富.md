    Ensuring the Victorious Realization of the Seven-Year Plan
    Rich Harvests from the National Discussion in the Soviet Union
    (Our Moscow Correspondent Shen Yiming reports on the 26th) Since the publication of the draft control figures report for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1959-1965 last November, a nationwide discussion has immediately swept across the Soviet Union. This discussion has been the most important event in the political life of the Soviet people in the past two months, and it is now coming to an end.
    This nationwide discussion on the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan has been conducted from beginning to end in a highly enthusiastic political and labor atmosphere. Encouraged by the beautiful prospects of the Seven-Year Plan, the working people in various regions have enthusiastically supported Khrushchev's draft report, actively put forward various suggestions, and launched labor competitions to welcome the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this nationwide discussion is actually a grand mobilization of the Soviet people marching towards communist construction.
    Extremely Wide-Ranging Content of Discussion
    The content involved in the discussion is extremely wide-ranging and rich, encompassing everything from the issue of the distribution of productive forces to the production of radio parts. But in general, the opinions expressed in the discussion are concentrated in the following aspects: tapping all potentials to accelerate the development of the national economy; ensuring that the development of various departments is coordinated and balanced; improving the layout of productive forces, and accelerating the development of the eastern regions and the specialization and comprehensive development of large economic regions; further developing cutting-edge science and science better serving production.
    Accelerating the Development of Industrial Production
    How to ensure the accelerated realization of the national economic tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan is one of the most frequently discussed aspects in this nationwide discussion. Developing the ferrous metallurgy industry is one of the key points of the Seven-Year Plan. Regarding the issue of how to provide more iron ore for the metallurgical sector, the leaders of the Party and enterprises in various mines have provided many suggestions. Moiashev, First Secretary of the Kursk Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, specifically discussed the issue of better utilizing the iron ore resources of the Kursk economic zone in a discussion article. He demanded that the exploration work be accelerated so as to determine the area for the construction of mines and metallurgical enterprises as soon as possible, and he also provided many materials suitable for use as metallurgical enterprise construction sites.
    In the next seven years, Kuzbass will still be one of the bases for providing coking coal to the metallurgical enterprises in the Urals and Siberia. Bestrov, manager of the Kuzbass Coal Mine Joint Enterprise, said in the discussion that the Kuzbass coal mines have great potential. The amount of open-pit mining alone can be almost doubled by 1965 compared with 1958, but in order to accelerate the increase in mining volume, it is necessary to further realize comprehensive mechanization.
    Regarding the development of the chemical industry, Dr. Fedorenko, an economist, said in a long article that to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, the production process must be technically improved, and chemical science institutions must explore new ways to utilize raw materials. He suggested vigorously developing raw materials for the production of synthetic substances from acetylene. In terms of the power industry, in order to win time in the economic competition with capitalist countries, a consensus in the discussion was to vigorously accelerate the development of thermal power plants. Many experts have provided suggestions on how to make the construction of thermal power plants faster and at a lower construction cost. For example, engineer Gudkevich suggested in a discussion article published in "Pravda": Build open-air thermal power plants without machine rooms as much as possible. This can save a huge amount of design work for the factory buildings and a large amount of funds for building the factory buildings, and the construction period can be greatly shortened. The construction time of an open-air thermal power plant with a power generation capacity of 600,000 kilowatts can be shortened by twelve to fourteen months compared with a thermal power plant with a factory building.
    Ensuring Balanced Development of Various Departments
    To develop the national economy at a high speed, ensuring the balance between various production departments is an important issue. Many opinions were expressed in this regard in the discussion, among which more concerned the issue of consistency between production plans and supply plans. Rubinchek, Vice Chairman of the Gorky National Economic Council, published an article on this topic, saying that the Gorky economic zone will greatly increase the production of automobiles, lathes, chemical products, and daily necessities in seven years. To ensure the smooth realization of the production plan, it largely depends on the balance of raw material technology supply and production plan. He suggested that the State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union and the various republics must take into account the corresponding supply plan when determining the production plan and construction plan for the economic commissions. In order to make the supply plan consistent with the production plan, it is necessary to make the local supply and marketing management agencies subordinate to the National Economic Council.
    In the comprehensive development of certain economic zones, the coordinated and balanced development of various industrial departments is one of the issues of concern to people in the discussion. For example, in economic zones that simultaneously develop metallurgy, mining, chemical, petroleum, and machine manufacturing industries, it is necessary to consider the planning coordination between these industries, because if any department in these industries does not consider other departments when formulating plans, it will affect the development speed of various enterprises.
    Developing the Potential of the Eastern Regions
    In the next seven years, the productivity of the eastern regions must be vigorously developed, because this region has very rich natural resources that have not yet been fully utilized. Many Party and economic leaders in the eastern regions have put forward many suggestions in the discussion on how to more effectively utilize the potential of this region. Kokalev, First Secretary of the Krasnoyarsk Krai Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, expressed his views on the rapid utilization of the natural wealth of Krasnoyarsk Krai, saying that the State Planning Commission has not fully estimated the raw material, fuel, and power potential for accelerating the development of the non-ferrous metallurgy industry in this krai. According to calculations, the construction speed of aluminum industry enterprises here can be much faster than the time currently stipulated in the plan. At the same time, the construction of the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station should be accelerated, because the completion of this hydropower station is of great significance for accelerating the development of the non-ferrous metal industry in this region.
    In the discussion, people pointed out that the comprehensive development of large economic zones has many benefits. For example, the reclaimed areas of Kazakhstan currently produce a large amount of grain, but lack industry, so the phenomenon has emerged that a large amount of grain has to be transported to other places for processing. There is not enough labor force during the harvest season, and it is necessary to temporarily transfer a large number of people from other regions to help with the harvest. This wastes a lot of manpower and financial resources. Therefore, many people suggested that the reclaimed areas should be comprehensively developed in the future, and some factories that start work in winter should be established, such as brick factories, wood processing factories, and sewing factories, so that many laborers can work in these factories during the winter slack season, and many laborers can settle in the reclaimed areas.
    Science Better Serves Production
    In this nationwide discussion, scientists and scholars have put forward many constructive opinions on how science can better serve production. Many scientists suggested that the development of computing technology should be strengthened in the next seven years, which is of great significance for promoting production process automation, scientific work, and engineering design. They suggested that computing centers should be established in large economic zones within the next two or three years, specializing in serving enterprises and research institutes in the economic zones. Computing departments should be set up in large factories and research institutes, and consideration should be given to establishing a national specialized research institute for computing technology. Because the industry and agriculture of many economic zones will be greatly developed in the next seven years, this urgently requires timely technical guidance from scientific departments. Some scientists suggested considering the establishment of branches of the Academy of Sciences in certain economic zones.
    In the nationwide discussion, people paid great attention to the issues of further improving and streamlining production management agencies and strengthening communist ideological education in the future. Some leaders of the National Economic Council believe that the division of certain economic zones should be appropriately adjusted in order to fully utilize the technology and resources of each economic zone.
    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on January 27, will finally review and approve the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. At present, the working people of the Soviet Union have confidently devoted themselves to selfless labor to strive for the victorious realization of the Seven-Year Plan.

    保证七年计划的胜利实现
    苏联全民讨论收获丰富
    本报莫斯科26日电　记者沈一鸣报道，自去年11月公布1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字报告提纲后，全苏各地立刻掀起了一个全民大讨论，这个大讨论是最近两个月来苏联人民政治生活中头等重要的事件，目前这个讨论即将结束。
    这次对七年计划控制数字展开的全民大讨论，自始至终是在十分高涨的政治劳动热情中进行的。在七年计划美好远景的鼓舞下，各地劳动人民一面热烈拥护赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲，并积极提出各种建议，同时并展开迎接苏共二十一次代表大会的劳动竞赛。因此这次全民大讨论实际上是一次苏联人民向共产主义建设进军的大誓师。
    讨论的内容极广泛
    讨论所涉及的内容是极其广泛和丰富的，大至生产力布局问题小至收音机零件生产问题无所不包。但总的来说，讨论中所发表的意见集中在如下几方面：发掘一切潜力，加速发展国民经济；各部门发展必须协调平衡；改进生产力的布局、加速发展东部地区和大经济区的专业化和综合发展问题；进一步发展尖端科学和科学更好地为生产服务。
    加快发展工业生产
    如何保证七年计划中规定的国民经济任务加快实现，是这次全民大讨论中发表意见最多的一个方面。发展黑色冶金业是七年计划的重点之一。如何为冶金部门提供更多的铁矿问题，各矿的党和企业的领导人提供了不少意见，苏共库尔斯克州党委第一书记莫伊阿舍夫在一篇讨论文章中专门谈了更好地利用库尔斯克经济区的铁矿资源问题，他要求加速勘察工作，以便及早确定矿井和冶金企业建设的面积，他并且提供了许多适宜作为冶金企业建设地的材料。
    在今后七年中，库兹巴斯仍是为乌拉尔和西伯利亚冶金企业提供焦煤的基地之一，库兹巴斯煤矿联合企业经理贝斯特罗夫在讨论中说，库兹巴斯的煤矿有很大的潜力，单是露天矿的开采量到1965年就可比1958年几乎增加一倍，但为了加速增加开采量，必需进一步实现综合机械化。
    在发展化学工业方面，经济学博士费多林科在一篇长文中说，要加速发展化学工业，必须在技术上改进生产过程，化学科学机构要开辟利用原料的新途径。他建议要大力发展从乙炔中产生合成物质的原料。在电力工业方面，为了在和资本主义国家经济竞赛中赢得时间，大力加快发展火力发电站是讨论中一致的意见。许多专家对如何使火力电站的建设速度更快，而建设成本更低提供了意见。例如工程师古得开维奇在“真理报”发表的一篇讨论文章中，建议：尽可能建设不设机器房的露天火力发电站，这样可以节省巨大厂房的设计工作和建造厂房的大量资金，建设期间也可大大缩短。一座发电能力为六十万瓩的露天火力电站的建设时间，可比设厂房的火力电站缩短十二到十四个月。
    保证各部门平衡发展
    要高速度发展国民经济，保证各生产部门之间的平衡是一个重要的问题，讨论中，在这方面发表的意见很多，其中较多的是生产计划和供应计划一致的问题。高尔基国民经济委员会副主席鲁宾奇克为此发表文章说，高尔基经济区在七年内要大大增加汽车、车床、化学制品和日用品的生产。要保证生产计划顺利实现，在很大程度上要靠原料技术供应和生产计划的平衡。他建议全苏和各加盟共和国国家计划委员会在给经济委员会确定生产计划和建设计划时，一定要考虑到相应的供应计划，为了使供应计划和生产计划一致，必须使地方供销管理机构从属于国民经济委员会。
    在综合发展某些经济区时，各工业部门协调平衡发展问题，是讨论中人们关心的问题之一。如在同时发展冶金、采矿、化学、石油、机器制造等工业的经济区，就必须要考虑到这些工业之间的计划协调，因为这些工业中任何一部门在订计划时不考虑到其他部门，都会影响各企业的发展速度。
    发展东部地区潜力
    在今后七年中要大力发展东部地区的生产力，因为这里有着非常丰富的自然资源还没有被充分利用起来。许多东部地区的党和经济领导人在讨论中对如何更有效地利用这一地区的潜在能力提出了许多建议。苏共克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区委第一书记科卡列夫就尽快利用克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区自然财富发表意见说，国家计划委员会还没有充分估计到在这个边疆区加速发展有色冶金工业的原料、燃料和动力潜力，据计算，这里制铝工业企业的建设速度可以比目前计划规定的时间快得多。同时应该加速克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的建设，因为建成这一水电站对加速发展这一地区的有色金属工业有很大意义。
    在讨论中，人们指出大的经济区综合发展的好处是很多的。例如哈萨克的开垦地区目前生产大批粮食，但是缺乏工业，因而出现了这样的现象：大批粮食只得运到外地加工。在收割时劳动力不够，必需到其他区临时抽调一大批人手来帮助收割。这样对人力财力浪费很大。因此许多人建议，垦荒地区今后应综合发展，应该建立一些在冬季开工的工厂，如制砖厂、木材加工厂、缝纫厂，使得冬季农闲时许多劳动力可在这些工厂工作，使许多劳动力在垦荒区定居下来。
    科学更好地为生产服务
    在这次大讨论中，科学家和学者们对科学如何更好地为生产服务，提出了许多建设性意见。许多科学家建议七年中要加强发展计算技术，这对促进生产过程自动化、科学工作和工程设计都有很大意义。他们建议在大的经济区在最近两三年内应建立起计算中心，专门为经济区的企业和研究所服务，在大的工厂和研究所应设立自己的计算部门，并应考虑建立全国性的计算技术的专门研究所。由于七年内许多经济区的工农业要大发展，这就极需科学部门及时的技术指导，有些科学家建议考虑在某些经济区成立科学院分院。
    在全民大讨论中，人们对今后进一步完善和精简生产管理机构和加强共产主义思想教育问题给了极大的注意。一些国民经济委员会的领导人认为某些经济区的划分应作适当调整，以便充分利用各经济区的技术和资源。
    在1月27日开幕的苏共第二十一次代表大会，将最后审查通过七年计划控制数字。目前全苏劳动人民已经充满信心地投入了为争取七年计划胜利实现的忘我劳动。
