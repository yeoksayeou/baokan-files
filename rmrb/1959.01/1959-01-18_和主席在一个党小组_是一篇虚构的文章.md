    “Being in the Same Party Group as Chairman” is a Fictional Article

    Our newspaper's supplement published "Being in the Same Party Group as Chairman" on November 13th of last year. This article originally appeared in the Liberation Army Daily. After its publication, readers pointed out that this article was inconsistent with the facts. After an investigation by the Liberation Army Daily's editorial department, it was confirmed that the entire article was fabricated from beginning to end.

    The fictitious nature of this article should have been easily apparent. However, we published it without conducting the necessary investigation and verification before reprinting it. This shows that we lack the necessary political responsibility. We must learn from this incident and improve our work.

    This article has been reprinted by many newspapers and periodicals, and some units have even compiled it into teaching materials. We hope that relevant parties will pay attention to this situation and stop spreading this fictional work; at the same time, we hope that readers, authors, and editors across the country will work together to eliminate this bad phenomenon of fabricating facts and deceiving the masses.　 Supplement Editors

    “和主席在一个党小组”是一篇虚构的文章
    本报副刊在去年11月13日发表了“和主席在一个党小组”，这篇文章原载解放军报。发表以后，有读者指出这篇文章与事实不符。经过解放军报编辑部派人调查，证实全文内容从头到尾都是虚构的。
    这篇文章的虚构性本来是容易看出来的。但是我们在转载这篇文章以前，没有进行必要的调查核实工作，就发表了。这说明我们缺乏应有的政治责任心。我们一定要从这个事件中吸取教训，改进工作。
    这篇文章已有许多报刊转载，甚至有些单位把它编成教材。我们希望有关的方面注意这个情况，不要再继续传播这种虚构的作品；同时也希望全国的读者、作者和编者，共同来消灭这种虚构事实、欺骗群众的不良现象。　副刊编者
