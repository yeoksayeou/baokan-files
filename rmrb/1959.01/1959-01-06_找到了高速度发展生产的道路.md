Found the Road to High-Speed Production Development
By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

Since liberation, the Chinese people have been actively seeking ways to increase agricultural production.

Where is the path? Some say that China has a large population and limited land, and that increased production is only possible through land reclamation. However, wasteland is far away in the border regions, and without sufficient manpower and resources, it is not easy to talk about. Thus, right-leaning conservatives have come to the conclusion that the only way to increase agricultural production in China is to wait for mechanization and take it slowly! The Party has always disagreed with this view. Based on the experience of high-yielding fields created by the masses in small areas in recent years, the Party believes that the way to increase agricultural production in China must be to increase yield per unit area. But right-leaning conservatives say that it is impossible to increase yields on a large scale. Is this really the case? Let the right-leaning conservatives take a look at the large-scale, high-yielding fields introduced at the National Agricultural Exhibition: In 1958, the area of ​​grain crops (excluding tubers) with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu reached more than 160 million mu, equivalent to 10% of the sown area of ​​grain crops (also excluding tubers), an increase of more than 100 times compared with the 1,000-jin mu in 1957. Cotton fields with more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu accounted for about two-fifths of the cotton planting area. And so on.... In the face of these large amounts of living facts, what reason do right-leaning conservatives have to say that large-scale production increases are impossible?

Great Significance

The emergence of large-scale, high-yielding fields has brought unprecedented bumper harvests to agricultural production in China. Among them, the grain production has doubled, not only solving the problem of feeding 600 million people across the country, but also making it possible to reasonably arrange the planting area of ​​grain crops, industrial raw material crops, cash crops, and feed crops as needed. This is of great importance for ensuring the supply of industrial raw materials and meeting the needs of the people's lives.

However, the emergence of large-scale, high-yielding fields has an even more far-reaching significance, which is that it creates favorable conditions for changing China's cultivation system. The characteristics of China's cultivation system are: in the north, there is vast land and sparse population, and insufficient labor, which has resulted in extensive cultivation and low yields; in the south, although the population is dense and labor is relatively abundant, the number of replantings is too high, and human and material resources cannot meet the needs of cultivation, which is actually also extensive cultivation and low yields.

For a long time, who has paid attention to this issue? Some bourgeois scholars attribute China's underdeveloped agriculture to the large population and limited land, and limited potential for increased production. Only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the realization of people's communes, the cultivation of large-scale, high-yielding fields, the implementation of intensive cultivation centered on the eight major measures for increasing production such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, has revealed the secrets of agricultural production potential. It is only possible to explain that China's cultivation system should change from extensive cultivation and low yields to less planting and more harvesting. This is a major revolution in China's agricultural production system.

Change from Extensive Cultivation and Low Yields to Less Planting, High Yields, and More Harvesting

Is it possible to change the extensive cultivation system to an intensive cultivation system with less planting, high yields, and more harvesting? The answer is yes. The achievements made in this area in Shanxi and other places in 1958 provide us with sufficient evidence. Shanxi Province has a total of 68 million mu of arable land, more than half of which is sloping land, with insufficient labor and low yields, with most yields below 100 jin per mu. In 1958, they extracted more than 37 million mu of suitable land for growing crops from the total arable land to establish "basic farmland," implemented intensive cultivation, and conscientiously implemented the eight-character "constitution" for agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection (disease and pest control), tools (improved tools), and management (field management), and thus obtained unprecedented bumper harvests. The average yield per mu of summer and autumn grains in the province reached 500 jin, equivalent to four times the average yield per mu in 1957, and the total output increased by 130% compared with the bumper harvest of 1956.

The experience of agricultural production in Shanxi Province shows that if all parts of the country, like Shanxi, change from extensive cultivation and low yields to intensive cultivation, less planting, high yields, and more harvesting, China's agricultural production will advance along a path of high-speed development - in a relatively short period of time, achieve high yields and sufficient agricultural products, gradually realize Comrade Mao Zedong's proposed "three-three system" (that is: one-third of the land for growing crops, one-third of the land for fallow, and one-third of the land for greening), and transfer an appropriate number of laborers from the agricultural front to the industrial front, to run industry on a large scale, accelerate the industrialization and mechanization and electrification of communes, thereby promoting the realization of the commune's ownership by the whole people and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas.

In Implementing the New Cultivation System, We Must Fight Against Right-Leaning Thought

Now, the promotion of large-scale, high-yielding fields and a cultivation system of less planting, high yields, and more harvesting has attracted the attention of all parts of the country. All localities have included the implementation of this new cultivation system in the 1959 agricultural production plan, requiring large harvests on a small amount of land.

This is a matter of special significance. In China, although grain production in 1958 leaped to a level of about 1,200 jin per capita nationwide, it is still not very affluent; while other agricultural crops such as cotton and oilseeds are still far from meeting the needs of the people. Therefore, future agricultural production must promote large-scale, high-yielding fields and a cultivation system of less planting, high yields, and more harvesting, to obtain abundant agricultural products, so that 650 million people can achieve abundance; as for the realization of China's industrialization and the undertaking of various socialist construction projects, it is also necessary to obtain sufficient raw materials from the promotion of the new cultivation system to accelerate the pace of progress.

However, not everyone agrees with the promotion of large-scale, high-yielding fields and a cultivation system of less planting, high yields, and more harvesting, and some people have doubts. They say that high-yielding fields require a lot of capital and labor, and although the yield is higher, it is not cost-effective compared to large fields. These arguments are essentially caused by the right-leaning conservative thought of being nostalgic for "extensive cultivation and low yields." Let the facts refute these arguments of "high-yield losses." The Taiqian People's Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, made a comparison of the labor input and yield of high-yield spring corn fields and ordinary fields: the average labor input for a mu with a yield of 10,000 to 20,000 jin is more than twice that of a mu with a yield of 1,300 jin, but the yield increases by six to fourteen times. The average labor input per mu of millet with a yield of more than 20,000 jin in this commune is more than three times that of a mu with a yield of 800 jin, but the yield has increased by twenty-four times. Looking at the production costs: the Xin'nan Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, spent 5.63 yuan per mu for general paddy fields in 1957, with a net income of 13.47 yuan per mu. In 1958, the production cost per mu for high-yielding paddy fields was 17.49 yuan, and the net income per mu was 240 yuan. In comparison, although the production cost per mu of high-yielding fields increased by more than two times compared to general fields, the net income increased by nearly seventeen times. Do these facts not show that engaging in high-yielding fields is not only not a loss, but also a great deal?

    找到了高速度发展生产的道路
    本报记者  古维进
    解放以来，我国人民一直都在积极寻求农业增产的道路。
    路子在哪里？有的人说：我国人多地少，要想增产，除非开荒。但是荒地远在边疆，没有足够的人力物力，谈何容易。于是右倾保守主义者对我国农业增产得出一个结论：“农业增产的道路只有等待机械化，慢慢的来吧！”党始终是不同意这种看法的。根据这几年来群众创造的小面积丰产田的经验，党认为我国农业增产的道路，必须是提高单位面积产量。但是右倾保守主义者又说，提高单产大面积是不可能的。事情真是这样的吗？让右倾保守主义者看一看全国农业展览会介绍的大面积高额丰产田的情形吧：1958年全国粮食作物（不包括薯类）亩产千斤以上的面积共达一亿六千多万亩，相当于粮食作物播种面积（也不包括薯类）的10％，比1957年的千斤亩增加了一百多倍。亩产百斤皮棉以上的棉田约占植棉面积五分之二左右。还有……。在这些大量的活生生的事实面前，右倾保守主义者还有什么理由说大面积增产是不可能呢？
    伟大的意义
    大面积高额丰产田的出现，给我国农业生产带来了空前未有的大丰收。其中由于粮食生产成倍地增长，不仅解决了全国六亿人的吃饭问题，而且有条件对粮食作物种植面积和工业原料作物、经济作物、饲料作物的种植面积根据需要来合理安排。这对于保证工业原料的供应，满足人民生活的需要都有很大作用。
    但是，大面积高额丰产田的出现，还有更深远的意义，这就是对我国耕作制度的改变创造了有利条件。我国耕作制度的特点是：在北方，地广人稀，劳力不足，形成了广种薄收；在南方，虽然人口稠密，劳力比较充足，但是复种次数太多，人力物力不能满足耕作的需要，实际上也是广种薄收。
      长期以来，有谁去注意这个问题呢？一些资产阶级学者谈到我国农业不发达，就归咎于人多地少，增产潜力有限。只有今天，在共产党的领导下，在农业生产大跃进和实现人民公社化的新形势下，培育了大面积高额丰产田，贯彻了以水、肥、土、种、密等八大增产措施为中心的精耕细作，揭开了农业增产潜力的秘密，才有可能说明我国的耕作制度应该是变广种薄收为少种多收。这是我国农业生产制度的重大革命。
    变广种薄收为少种、高产、多收
    把广种薄收的耕作制度改为精耕细作，少种、高产、多收的耕作制度有没有实现的可能呢？回答是肯定的。1958年山西等地在这方面取得的成绩，给我们提供了充分的根据。山西省共有耕地六千八百万亩，其中半数以上是坡地，劳力不足，产量低，大部分亩产在百斤以下。1958年他们从总耕地面积中抽出适宜种农作物的三千七百多万亩建立了“基本农田”，实行精耕细作，认真贯彻水、肥、土、种、密、保（除治病虫病害）、工（改良工具）、管（田间管理）农业八字“宪法”，于是获得了历史上从未有过的大丰收。全省夏秋粮食平均单产达到五百斤，相当于1957年平均亩产的四倍，总产量比丰收的1956年提高了130％。
    山西省农业生产的经验表明，如果全国各地都像山西那样改广种薄收为精耕细作、少种、高产、多收，我国农业生产就会沿着一条高速度发展的道路前进——在较短的时期内，取得高额产量和足够的农产品，逐步实现毛泽东同志提出的“三三制”（即：三分之一的土地种庄稼，三分之一的土地休闲，三分之一的土地绿化），并把适当数量的劳动力从农业战线转移到工业战线上来，大办工业，加速公社工业化和农业机械化电气化，从而促进公社全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。
    在实行新的耕作制度中必须和右倾思想作斗争
    现在，推广大面积高额丰产田和少种、高产、多收的耕作制度，已经引起全国各地的重视。各地都把实行这一新的耕作制度列入1959年的农业生产规划，要求在少量的土地上得到大量的收获。
    这是一件具有特殊意义的事情。在我国，1958年粮食生产虽然跃进到全国平均每人有一千二百斤左右的水平，但仍然不是很富裕的；而其他农作物如棉花、油料等，还距离人民的需要很远。因此，今后的农业生产，必须推广大面积高额丰产田和少种、高产、多收的耕作制度，取得丰富的农产品，才能使六亿五千万人民达到丰衣足食；至于实现我国工业化和进行各项社会主义建设事业，也同样需要从推广新的耕作制度里，取得足够的原料，来加速前进的步伐。
    但是，推广大面积高额丰产田和少种、高产、多收的耕作制度，并不是人人都赞同的，还有些人存在怀疑。他们说，高产田摊的本钱大，费的工多，产量虽然高一些，但和大田比起来，也是划不来的。这些论调，实质上是留恋“广种薄收”的右倾保守思想在作怪。让事实来驳斥这些“高产赔本论”的论调吧。山东省寿张县台前人民公社把春玉米高产田与一般田的用工量和产量作了一个比较：亩产一万到二万斤的平均用工量比亩产一千三百斤的多用二倍多，但产量增加六到十四倍。这个社亩产二万斤以上的谷子平均每亩用工量比亩产八百斤的多三倍多，但产量则增加了二十四倍。再从生产费用方面来看：江苏省新沂县红旗人民公社新南大队1957年一般水稻田每亩生产费用五元六角三分，每亩纯收益十三元四角七分。1958年水稻丰产田每亩生产费用十七元四角九分，每亩纯收益二百四十元。两相比较，丰产田每亩的生产费用虽比一般田增加二倍多，但纯收益增加了近十七倍。这些事实，不是说明搞高产田不仅不赔本，而且大大的划得来吗？
