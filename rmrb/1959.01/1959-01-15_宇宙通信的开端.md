The Beginning of Space Communication
Ma Dayou, Deputy Director of the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

If we say that the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, marked a new era in mankind's conquest of nature, then the launch of the Soviet space rocket on January 2, 1959, was the real beginning of spaceflight. This beginning is extraordinary: a ton and a half of behemoth carrying nearly four hundred kilograms of scientific instruments to study a series of extremely important scientific questions, most of which have never been studied before, nor could they be studied. In addition, there are measurements of temperature, pressure, and rocket flight conditions. A large amount of scientific data was sent back from extremely remote locations (up to 500,000 kilometers, more than 160 times the radius of the Earth) using radio communication methods. The rocket's position (distance and direction to the Earth) and speed were also measured with extremely high accuracy using radio methods, and the parameters of the rocket's orbit were accurately calculated based on these data, with an accuracy of 99.9%. These amazing achievements are a good start to space radio communication, which was born with spaceflight. Space communication will play an increasingly important role in human life.

The radio equipment in the space rocket transmits signals to Earth using four types of radio waves: 19.997 and 19.995 MHz (one million vibrations per second of a radio wave is called one MHz) are used to send telegrams, and 19.993 MHz is used to transmit scientific observation data. These three radio waves are all short waves with wavelengths of more than fifteen meters (radio waves with wavelengths between two hundred meters and ten meters, and frequencies between 1.5 MHz and 30 MHz); in addition, there are ultra-short waves (radio waves with wavelengths shorter than ten meters and frequencies higher than 30 MHz) at 183.6 MHz (wavelength 1.633 meters), used to transmit scientific intelligence and for ground positioning. Ultra-short waves of more than 100 MHz are basically unaffected when passing through the atmosphere. As long as the rocket is above the horizon, or even slightly below the horizon, the signal can be received, so it is a reliable and efficient communication medium. Short waves are refracted and absorbed by the ionosphere, so their effectiveness is relatively poor, but they can be received with general shortwave receivers, which also has its advantages.

In the past, the distance of radio communication rarely exceeded 10,000 kilometers. This time, the signal of the space rocket could be reliably received up to 500,000 kilometers away, which is a great progress. This not only requires a highly sensitive transceiver system (the antenna on the rocket must also be kept aligned with the Earth to avoid reducing sensitivity), but the required power (the function completed per unit time is called power) is also very large, estimated to reach one kilowatt (kW, one kilowatt equals 1.36 horsepower. One horsepower is the function of lifting a weight of 550 pounds one foot per second). This is equivalent to installing a not-so-small radio station on the rocket (many local radio stations only use a few hundred watts), which is of course much more complicated than a ground radio station. Power is not the main problem, the main thing is that the frequency (the number of vibrations of the radio wave per second) requires very high stability. The frequencies of the above three short waves only differ by two in the fifth digit, so the frequency must be stabilized to the fifth digit or above, otherwise they will interfere with each other. The rocket's speed is measured using the "Doppler effect" (this is a term in acoustics, meaning that when a sound-emitting object approaches a listener at a certain speed, the sound frequency heard by the listener will be higher than the original frequency emitted by the object, and when the sound-emitting object moves away from the listener, the sound frequency heard by the listener will be reduced; such a frequency change is called the "Doppler effect"). On January 4th at 10:57, the maximum radial velocity of the rocket was measured to be 2.34 kilometers per second, which is 78 parts per ten million of the speed of light. The Doppler frequency shift (the difference between the received frequency and the emitted frequency) caused by this speed is only 78 parts per ten thousand of the original frequency, so this measurement requires the frequency stability to be at least one part per ten million, or the seventh digit, which is even higher than the requirements of some radio stations. This is the requirement when the rocket is in the ultra-high vacuum tens of thousands of kilometers away from the ground, with strong sunlight shining from one side and strong cosmic rays shooting from all directions. The complexity of the problem can be imagined. Therefore, the success of this first space radio communication also shows that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in electronic research.

The Soviet space rocket also released a bright sodium vapor cloud—an artificial comet—at an altitude of about 110,000 kilometers according to pre-arrangement. This is not only a major innovation in astronomy, but it also provides new possibilities for radio communication and television. Television and ultra-short wave communication and broadcasting use ultra-short waves that propagate in a straight line, cannot bend with the Earth's surface, and cannot be reflected on the ionosphere. Therefore, the propagation distance is short, only slightly farther than the place where the eyes can see (the horizon). Despite the use of very high antennas and large power, the maximum propagation distance is only two or three hundred kilometers. It has long been suggested to broadcast television programs over a larger area using airplanes or balloons as relay stations at high altitudes, but because the maintenance of relay equipment at high altitudes is relatively difficult, this method has not been truly used. Some time ago, Soviet scientists suggested releasing three artificial Earth satellites as relay stations. As long as the distance is appropriate, their rotation speed can be equal to the Earth's rotation speed, so they appear stationary in the air when viewed from the ground. Now that the method of releasing sodium clouds in outer space has been successful, we can use sodium clouds as reflectors (or scatterers) instead of satellites to scatter high-power ultra-short waves emitted from the ground over a large area (Professor Shmakov, a Soviet scientist, suggested using two sodium clouds to scatter to the entire surface of the Earth), so that excellent television programs and ultra-short wave broadcasts can be received everywhere, and ultra-short wave communication can also be carried out between any two points. The advantage of this method is that no energy is needed in the upper air, and there are no maintenance problems.

According to the current level of Soviet rocket technology, it is already possible to launch a spacecraft orbiting the moon from the ground. The spacecraft can be equipped with an autopilot, and its movement can also be controlled by radio commands issued from the ground. The spacecraft carries observation equipment to observe temperature, pressure, rays, magnetic fields, particles, etc., and can also carry a television camera equipped with a telescope to carefully observe the surface of the moon. The observed data is sent back by radio waves at certain times according to ground commands. The accurate position and movement of the spacecraft can also be remotely measured by radio methods (using electronic computers for precise calculations). Such a set of radio tracking, control, and telemetry systems is completely possible in the current level of electronics technology. The frequency used in this system should be roughly between 100 and 3000 MHz. Radio waves below 100 MHz are easily affected by the ionosphere, and the size of the required directional antenna is too large. Radio waves with frequencies higher than 3000 MHz are absorbed by water vapor and other gases in the air. Within this range, the lower the frequency, the higher the efficiency, but a higher frequency can reduce the size of the antenna. Generally, when using 500 MHz, the required radio transmission power on the lunar satellite is about two kilowatts, and the ground requires two hundred kilowatts. It is simpler and safer to use such unmanned spacecraft to carefully observe the surface of the moon and the surrounding environment than to send people up at the beginning, and it will not be difficult to send people up after detailed observation.

With the current Soviet space rocket, reaching Venus and Mars, and even Mercury, is almost possible, but space communication within such a range remains to be solved, so observing near other planets still needs further research. The shortest distance from Earth to Venus is 40 million kilometers, and the longest is 250 million kilometers; the distances to Mars are 80 million kilometers and 380 million kilometers. Therefore, the power required to establish a control and observation system from Earth to Venus or near Mars is much greater. The spacecraft to Mars would require a radio transmission power of about six megawatts, and the ground control system would require six hundred megawatts (assuming the same 500 MHz as the lunar spacecraft above) to establish a reliable connection as described above. Such a large transmission power is still impossible at present. We need to study methods to obtain huge power, or antenna systems that are much more directional than what is currently possible.

Space radio communication also poses many other new scientific and technological problems for electronics technology. The space where the rocket is located has a much higher degree of vacuum than can be obtained on the ground, so the vacuum outside the electron tube must be better than inside. How to use this, how to prevent leakage and evaporation? The temperature on the side of the rocket exposed to the sun will reach above the boiling point of water, while the temperature on the shaded side will reach the temperature of liquid oxygen. How to make the electronic equipment work normally? In space, the original cosmic rays are very strong, and meteor dust often collides. Will this affect the electronic equipment? Will it corrode and damage it? Will it form radio noise that has never been encountered on the ground? How does this noise affect communication and control? In space communication, semiconductor diodes and triodes should be used as much as possible. Are they afraid of radiation from solar rays, cosmic rays, etc.? There are many problems that need to be studied.

The new era of spaceflight has opened up a new world of space communication for electronics workers, which will undoubtedly greatly promote the development of electronics.

    宇宙通信的开端
    中国科学院电子学研究所副所长　马大猷
    如果我们说，1957年10月4日苏联发射了第一个人造地球卫星，是人类征服自然界的新纪元的话；那么，1959年1月2日苏联宇宙火箭的发射就是宇宙航行真正开始的日子。这个开始是不寻常的，一吨半的庞然大物带着近四百公斤的科学仪器去研究一大串极其重要的科学问题，而且大部分是以前从来没有研究过、也不可能研究的。此外还有温度、压力以及火箭飞行情况的测定。大量的科学数据用无线电通信方法从极其遥远（最远达到五十万公里，地球半径的一百六十倍以上）的地方送回，火箭的位置（到地球的距离和方向）和速度也以极高的准确程度用无线电方法测定，并根据这些数据准确地算出火箭轨道的参数，准确程度达到千分之九百九十九。这些惊人的成就就是随着宇宙航行而诞生的宇宙无线电通信的良好的开端，宇宙通信将在人类生活中起越来越大的作用。
    在宇宙火箭中的无线电设备用四种电波向地球发射信号：19.997和19.995兆赫（无线电波每秒钟振动一百万次叫一兆赫）用于发送电报，19.993兆赫，用于传递科学观测的数据，这三种电波都是波长十五公尺多的短波（波长在二百公尺和十公尺之间，频率在一点五兆赫和三十兆赫之间的无线电波）；此外还有超短波（波长短于十公尺，频率高于三十兆赫的无线电波）183.6兆赫（波长1.633公尺），用于传递科学情报并供地面上测位。一百多兆赫的超短波传过大气时基本不受影响，只要火箭在地平线以上，甚至于在地平线下一点时，信号就可以收到，所以它是可靠而效率高的通信媒介。短波要受电离层的折射和吸收，效力比较差，不过用一般短波接收机就可以收听，也有它的优点。
    过去无线电通信的距离超过一万公里时不多，这次宇宙火箭的信号一直到五十万公里外还能可靠地接收到，这是很大的进展。这不但需要灵敏度很高的收发系统（火箭上的天线还必须保持对准地球的方向，以免灵敏度降低），所需要的功率（每单位时间内所完成的功能叫做功率）也是很大的，估计要达到一千瓦（即瓩，一千瓦等于1.36马力。一马力是每秒钟所作的功能将5.50磅重量提起一呎的距离）。这就等于在火箭上装一部不太小的广播电台（很多地方的广播电台不过用几百瓦），这当然比地面上的广播电台要复杂多了。功率还不是主要问题，主要的是频率（无线电波每秒钟振动的次数）的稳定要求很高。上面三个短波的频率只在第五位差二，因此频率必须稳定到第五位以上，否则彼此就要互相干扰。火箭的速度是用“多普勒效应”（这是声学中的名词，即当发声的物体以一定的速度接近听者，听者所听到的声音频率将较物体所发出的原来的频率为高，而当发声物体向听者离去时，听者所听到的声音频率将减低，这样的频率变化称为“多普勒效应”）测定的，在1月4日10时57分测得的火箭最大径向速度是每秒2.34公里，这是光速的千万分之七十八。这个速度引起的多普勒频移（收到的频率和发出的频率相差），也只有原频率的千分之七十八，因此这个测量就要求频率的稳定度至少到千万分之一，或是第七位数，比有些广播电台的要求还高。这是火箭在离地几万公里的超高真空里、在强烈的太阳光从一面照射而强烈的宇宙线又从各方面射来的情况下的要求，问题的复杂可想而知。因此这第一次的宇宙无线电通信的成功也说明，苏联在电子学的研究工作中已获得极大成就。
    苏联宇宙火箭还根据预先的安排在约十一万公里的高空放出了发亮的钠蒸气云——人造慧星，这不但在天文学上是重大的创举，它对无线电通信和电视也提供了新的可能性。电视和超短波通信和广播所用的超短波是沿着直线传播的，不能随地球表面而弯曲，也不能在电离层上反射，因此传播距离短，只能比眼睛能看到的地方（地平面）稍远一点，尽管使用很高的天线和很大的功率，最大传播距离也不过二、三百公里。很早就有人建议在高空用飞机或气球转播的办法把电视节目在较大范围里广播，不过因为在高空中对转播设备的维护比较困难，这个办法还没有人真正用过。前些时候，苏联科学家建议放出三颗人造地球卫星作转播站，只要距离合适就可以使它们的旋转速度等于地球自转速度，因而由地面上看来它们在空中是固定不动的。现在在外层空间放出钠云的方法成功了，我们就可以不用卫星而利用钠云作反射体（或散射体），把地面上射去的高功率超短波散射到很大面积（苏联科学家什马科夫教授建议用两片钠云向地球全部表面散射），使到处都能收到优美的电视节目和超短波广播，也可以在任何两点间作超短波通信。这个办法的优点是在上空不需要能源，没有维护问题。
    按现在苏联的火箭技术水平，已经可以由地面上发出绕月球旋转的宇宙飞船了。飞船上可以设自动驾驶器，还可以由地面上用无线电发出命令控制它的运动。飞船上带着观测设备，对温度、压力、射线、磁场、粒子等等都进行观测，还可以带着配有望远镜头的电视摄像机仔细观察月球表面。观测的数据按照地面上的命令，在一定时候用无线电波发送回来。飞船的准确位置和运动情况也可以用无线电方法遥测（用电子计算机进行精密的计算）。这样一套无线电跟踪、控制和遥测系统，在目前的电子学技术水平看来是完全可能的。在这种系统中使用的频率大致应在100到3000兆赫之间。低于100兆赫的无线电波容易受电离层的影响，所需要的指向性天线的尺寸也太大。频率高于3000兆赫的电波则要受空气中的水蒸气和其它气体的吸收。在这个范围内，频率越低效率越高，不过频率高些可以减少天线尺寸。大致用500兆赫时，月球卫星上所需要的无线电发射功率大约二千瓦，地面上则需二百千瓦。先用这样无人驾驶的宇宙飞船去详细观测月球表面和周围的情况比开始就送人上去要简单、安全，而且经过详细观察再送人上去就不困难了。
    用现在的苏联宇宙火箭达到金星和火星甚至于水星都已差不多了，但是在这样范围内的宇宙通信还待我们解决，因而去其它行星附近观察的事还需进一步研究。地球到金星的距离最短时是四千万公里，最长时是二亿五千万公里，到火星则是八千万公里和三亿八千万公里；因此建立地球到金星或火星附近的控制、观测系统所需要的功率就大得多了。到火星的宇宙飞船大约需要无线电发射功率六兆瓦，而地面控制系统则需六百兆瓦（和上面月球飞船一样都假设用500兆赫），才能建立起像上面所述的可靠联系。像这样大的发射功率在目前还是办不到的。我们就需要研究获得巨大功率的方法，或者比目前所能作的方向性更强得多的天线系统。
    宇宙无线电通信对电子学技术还提出很多其它新的科学技术问题。火箭所处的空间比地面上所能获得的真空程度还要高得多，因此电子管外边的真空就要比里面还好，如何利用这一点，如何防止漏气、蒸发，火箭在太阳晒到的一面温度要到水的沸点以上，而在背阴的一面要达到液体氧气的温度，怎样使电子学设备工作正常？太空中，原始宇宙线很强，流星尘埃也常撞来，对电子学设备有无影响，会不会腐蚀损坏？会不会形成地面没有遇到过的无线电噪声？这种嗓声如何影响通信和控制？宇宙通信中显见要尽量使用半导体二级管、三级管等，它们怕不怕太阳射线、宇宙线等的辐射等等，需要研究的问题还很多。
    宇宙航行的新时代给电子学工作者开辟了宇宙通信的新天地，毫无疑问将大大促进电子学的发展。
