Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 14th: According to "Borba", nearly 90% of students in Yugoslav universities have failed to graduate on time in the past three years due to poor grades. The "Komunist" weekly also stated: "The study period in all university departments in Yugoslavia exceeds the statutory time by 50%. At the University of Belgrade, the average study period extends to about eight years."

The "News" weekly, in an article titled "The Long Road," stated that at the University of Belgrade, "out of the 3,250 students who graduated in the 1955-1956 academic year, only 6.5% graduated on time. Of the students who graduated in the 1956-1957 academic year, only 8.6% graduated on time. Among the students who did not graduate on time, 19.6% to 20.1% were held back for three years."

The academic performance of students is also not good in universities outside the capital. "News" weekly said that at the Universities of Zagreb and Ljubljana, only 1.1% to 1.7% of the graduates in the 1956-1957 academic year graduated on time, and more than 20% of the graduates were delayed for more than four years. When talking about the reasons why students cannot graduate on time, "News" weekly quoted teachers as saying that it is because "many university students are not interested in attending classes." The weekly wrote: "We learned from the Department of Architecture at the University of Belgrade that out of 200 freshmen, 120 did not come to the department at all throughout the year." However, some university students often go to nightclubs to enjoy themselves by dancing half-naked and doing rock and roll dances.

    南斯拉夫高等教育情况糟糕
    绝大多数大学生因成绩不好不能按时毕业
    新华社14日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：据“战斗报”透露，最近三年中，在南斯拉夫各高等学校中有将近90％的学生因成绩不好不能按时毕业。“共产主义者”周刊也说：南斯拉夫国内“所有大学院系中的学习期限都超过了法定时间的50％。在贝尔格莱德大学的学习期限平均延续到八年左右”。
      “新闻”周报在一篇题为“漫长的道路”的文章中说，贝尔格莱德大学“在1955至1956学年毕业的三千二百五十名大学生中，按时毕业的只占6.5％。在1956至1957学年毕业的大学生中，按时毕业的也不过8.6％。在未按时毕业的学生中，有19.6％到20.1％都留级了三年”。
    在首都以外的一些大学里，学生的成绩也并不好。“新闻”周报说，萨格勒布大学、卢布尔雅那大学在1956至1957学年的毕业生中，只有1.1％至1.7％是准时毕业的，其中20％以上的毕业生都延迟了四年以上。“新闻”周报在谈到学生不能准时毕业的原因时，援引教师的话说，因为
  “很多大学生对上课不感兴趣”。这家周报写道：“我们在贝尔格莱德大学建筑系里了解到，在二百名入学的一年级大学生中，有一百二十名在整个一年中就根本没有到系里来过。”但是，却经常有些大学生到跳半裸体舞和阿飞舞的夜总会里去消遣。
