Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 20th. The government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) sent a note to the Soviet government on the 19th, welcoming the recent proposals made by the Soviet government regarding the German peace treaty issue. The note stated that the GDR government welcomes the Soviet government's proposals to achieve a consolidated and lasting peace in Central Europe and expresses agreement in principle with the draft peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union.

The note fully supports the Soviet government's suggestion to convene a broad peace conference in the shortest possible time. The note declared that the GDR is willing to participate in this conference, as well as in corresponding preparatory negotiations with the Four Powers.

The note was delivered yesterday by First Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR Council of Ministers, Walter Ulbricht, to the Soviet Ambassador to the GDR, Mikhail Pervukhin. It is a response to the Soviet government's note to the GDR on January 10th of this year regarding the German peace treaty issue, and to the draft peace treaty.

The reply note points out that the Soviet government's note and draft peace treaty are also the most positive and constructive response to the note issued by the GDR government to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on September 4, 1958, regarding the conclusion of a German peace treaty.

The note states that the development process of the GDR is fully consistent with the principles of the Soviet proposals. This consistency will undoubtedly contribute to the conclusion of a peace treaty that is in the interests of the German people.

The note says that the Soviet government's note also justly points out that the West German ruling circles are taking advantage of the lack of a peace treaty to carry out increasingly large-scale atomic armament and war preparations. They disregard the desire of the vast majority of West German residents for peace and mutual understanding.

The note states that the danger of the path taken by those who are carrying out West German atomic armament further demonstrates the urgency of immediately preparing for a German peace treaty and convening a peace conference within two months.

The note states that only by stopping the revanchist politicians and militarists in West Germany and putting all of Germany on the path to peace can there be hope for a life in Europe without the fear of atomic war.

The note points out that the concluded peace treaty should guarantee the peaceful and democratic conditions and the sovereign integrity by land, sea and air of the German people, and must include the abolition of the occupation regime in West Berlin. In this way, the most dangerous hotbed of tension in Europe can be eliminated, and understanding between the two Germanys can be promoted.

The note believes that the Soviet proposal to immediately conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys, and also with the German Confederation (as long as they form it before the conclusion of the peace treaty), is an important step in easing international tension and ending the Cold War. The West German ruling circles are now putting forward waiting for German reunification before concluding a peace treaty as the reason for their rejection of the Soviet proposals, which is hypocritical. The note says that the Bonn ruling clique has opposed both the conclusion of a German peace treaty and unification talks between the two Germanys in the past. They have placed the Paris Treaty and the resolutions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization above the national interests of the German people. This poses a great danger to the German people. Therefore, it is even more necessary to convene a peace conference to conclude a peace treaty.

The note goes on to say that the peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government opens up broad prospects of happiness and well-being for the German people. This peace treaty will guarantee peace and prevent Germany from participating in military aggression blocs. It guarantees that all foreign troops will withdraw from Germany and that all foreign military bases will be eliminated. Germany will gain complete freedom to develop its economy and trade, which will give the German people unlimited possibilities to unleash their great creativity. At the same time, the peace treaty will free West Germany from the shackles of military ties with some countries. Germany, as a peaceful country with a strong economy and thriving culture, will occupy its due place in the family of nations. By signing the peace treaty, the two Germanys can participate in the United Nations and other international organizations and become full members with full rights. The peace treaty will also ensure the safety of the peoples of all countries that have been attacked by German militarism and imperialism in the two world wars, and the peace treaty will establish a solid foundation for the development of good neighborly and friendly relations between the peoples of these countries and the German people.

The note concludes, "The German Democratic Republic will continue to strive for agreement among all the German people on the issue of the peace treaty."

### 民主德国政府就对德和约照会苏联政府  苏联的建议将给德国人民带来幸福  支持在最短期间召开和会　争取全德人民就和约取得一致意见

    民主德国政府就对德和约照会苏联政府
    苏联的建议将给德国人民带来幸福
    支持在最短期间召开和会　争取全德人民就和约取得一致意见
    新华社柏林20日电　德意志民主共和国政府19日照会苏联政府，表示欢迎苏联政府最近就对德和约问题提出的建议。照会说，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联政府使中欧获得巩固和持久和平的建议，并且对苏联提出的和约草案表示原则上同意。
    照会完全支持苏联政府关于在最短期间召开广泛和平会议的建议。照会声明德意志民主共和国愿意参加这个会议。以及参加同四大国相应的预备谈判。
    这份照会由德意志民主共和国部长会议第一副总理乌布利希于昨天交给苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使别尔乌辛。它是对苏联政府今年1月10日对对德和约问题给德意志民主共和国的照会和对德和约草案的答复。
    复照指出，苏联政府的照会和和约草案同时是对1958年9月4日德意志民主共和国政府就缔结对德和约问题向苏、美、英、法四国政府发出的照会的最积极和最有建设性的回答。
    照会说，德意志民主共和国的发展进程是与苏联建议中的原则完全一致的。这种一致无疑地将会有助于缔结一个符合德国人民利益的和约。
    照会说，苏联政府的照会还公正地指出，西德统治集团利用没有签订和约的情况，进行规模愈来愈大的原子武装和战争准备。他们无视西德绝大多数居民的要求和平与相互了解的愿望。
    照会说，实行西德原子武装的人们所采取的道路的危险性更加表明了，必须立即准备对德和约和在两个月内召开和平会议的迫切性。
    照会说，唯有制止西德的复仇主义政客和军国主义者，使全德国走上和平道路以后，才有希望在欧洲实现没有原子战争恐惧的生活。
    照会指出，签订的和约，要保障德国人民的和平民主条件和海陆空的主权完整，并且必须包括废除西柏林的占领制度在内。这样，就可以消除欧洲紧张局势的最危险的温床并促进两个德国之间的谅解。
    照会认为，苏联关于立即同两个德国而且也同德意志邦联（只要它们在缔结和约之前组成）缔结和约的建议，是缓和国际紧张局势和结束冷战的重要步骤。西德统治集团现在提出等待德国重新统一以后再缔结和约，作为他们拒绝苏联建议的理由，正是伪善者的做法。照会说，波恩统治集团过去既反对缔结对德和约，又反对两个德国进行统一谈判。他们把巴黎条约和北大西洋公约组织的决议放在德国人民民族利益之上。这给德国人民造成了巨大的危险。因此，更有必要召开缔结和约的和会。
    照会接着说，苏联政府建议的和约，给德国人民开辟了幸福和美好的广阔前途。这个和约将保证和平，不许德国参加军事侵略集团。它保证所有外国军队撤出德国并且将消灭一切外国军事基地。德国将获得发展自己经济和贸易的完全自由，这将给予德国人民发挥自己巨大创造力的无限可能性。同时，和约将使西德摆脱同一些国家军方联系的桎梏。德国作为一个经济强盛和文化繁荣的和平国家将在各国人民家庭中占有应有的地位。由于签订和约，使两个德国可以参加联合国和其他国际组织，成为其中的具有充分权利的成员。和约还将保证在两次世界大战中遭到德国军国主义和帝国主义进攻的各国人民得到安全，而且和约将为发展这些国家的人民同德国人民之间的睦邻和友好关系建立牢固基础。
    照会最后说，“德意志民主共和国将继续努力，争取全体德国人民就和约问题取得一致的意见。”
