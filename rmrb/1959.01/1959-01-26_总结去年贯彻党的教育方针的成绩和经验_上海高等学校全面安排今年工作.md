Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th. After more than a month of free airing and debate, Shanghai's universities have initially summarized the great achievements made in implementing the Party's education policy last year. Based on this summary, they have further made comprehensive arrangements for teaching, scientific research, productive labor, as well as better utilizing the role of teachers and caring for the lives of teachers and students.

Last year, in the process of implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, hundreds and thousands of teachers and students from Shanghai's universities went deep into factories, rural areas, mountainous regions, and the sea to engage in productive labor while conducting scientific research. This launched a vigorous education revolution, began to change the past situation in these schools of neglecting politics, divorcing from productive labor, and divorcing from reality, transformed the style of study, and created a variety of mass line teaching methods that linked theory with practice. Many of these methods have begun to be promoted. In order to adhere to the policy of combining education with productive labor, recently, the schools have in principle stipulated that students spend three months each year participating in productive labor, eight months studying, and one month on vacation. The teaching or productive labor time of different departments and majors can also be appropriately adjusted.

The new teaching plan emphasizes that the content of productive labor and scientific research for university students must be combined with their major as much as possible. Of the three months of labor time, in addition to about one month participating in industrial and agricultural production and other voluntary labor, the other two months can be spent either centrally or dispersedly going down to the countryside and factories in conjunction with their majors, participating in productive labor on the one hand and conducting on-site teaching and scientific research on the other. Each school has put forward different requirements for students' participation in productive labor according to different majors and different grades. For example, students in the first, second, and third grades of science and engineering majors should become familiar with the production knowledge of their major and learn basic operations through labor; senior students are required to be able to independently complete a certain process design or undertake a part of the scientific research task in addition to being familiar with operating techniques, so that students will have both systematic professional theoretical knowledge and practical production skills upon graduation. When students of literature and history majors participate in productive labor in factories and rural areas, they engage in investigation, research and study in conjunction with their majors while working, such as collecting and studying folk songs, compiling factory histories and people's commune histories, and engaging in social and economic surveys.

In the curriculum arrangement, all schools have paid attention to strengthening the teaching of basic courses and theoretical courses. Many schools have deleted repetitive, outdated, and inappropriate parts of the original basic course content, and added new disciplines reflecting modern scientific achievements. The Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics departments of Fudan University have decided to offer new basic courses such as Modern Chemical Experiment Technology in the next semester. The Geography Department of East China Normal University has divided the original General Physical Geography course into courses such as Astronomy, Meteorology and Climatology, Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Quaternary Geology according to different content. These arrangements are all designed to enable students to acquire more complete basic theoretical knowledge. In addition, some schools have also added new courses such as Basic Issues of Physical Geography, Introduction to Economic Geography, and Economic Survey of People's Communes, which are closely related to the development of people's communes, so that students can conduct comprehensive surveys of small areas after studying.

In addition to continuing to conduct political and ideological education for students in conjunction with various political movements and productive labor, all schools will also begin systematic political theory courses, and stipulate that approximately one day a week be devoted to socialist and communist ideological education and lecturing on political theory courses. Some schools have already opened courses in Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism and Political Economics.

Regarding scientific research, under the premise of ensuring the completion of teaching tasks, the schools have initially determined to undertake a part of the scientific research tasks assigned by the state and to train high-quality cadres, combining the research of cutting-edge science, the research of solving practical production problems, and teaching work, so as to be able to complete the scientific research tasks assigned by the state well and to continuously improve the quality of teaching. Teachers and students of the Geography Department of East China Normal University have decided to set aside a certain amount of time and effort each year to accept state tasks, go to the field to investigate and study the resource status of the motherland, and at the same time conduct on-site teaching and productive labor. Fudan University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and other schools with better conditions are all preparing to conduct research on cutting-edge science and technology and conduct experimental and intermediate production in their own factories in conjunction with teaching to serve Shanghai's industrial development.

Classroom teaching is still put forward as the main form of teaching in all schools, and at the same time, attention should be paid to combining it with on-site teaching. Courses that are suitable for on-site teaching should be moved to the site for teaching as much as possible in conjunction with productive labor. In teaching work, many schools have determined that attention should be paid to both giving play to the leading role of teachers and paying attention to giving play to students' initiative and enthusiasm in learning. At the same time, attention should be paid to absorbing experienced workers, peasants, local experts, and practical work cadres to participate in teaching, so that theory and practice, teaching and production are more closely linked.

In the new teaching plans of the schools, full attention has also been paid to the rest and recreational and sports activities of teachers and students, ensuring that teachers and students have eight hours of sleep time and four to six hours of eating, recreational activities, and sports exercise time every day. Arrangements have also been made for the time necessary for teachers to prepare lessons and pursue further studies, and necessary care has been given to the lives of weak and elderly teachers. Recently, the schools have also strengthened the leadership and management of collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens on campus, so that teachers and students can work, study, and live better.

    总结去年贯彻党的教育方针的成绩和经验
    上海高等学校全面安排今年工作
    新华社上海25日电　经过最近一个多月的鸣放讨论，上海高等学校初步总结了去年一年贯彻党的教育方针的巨大成绩，并在总结的基础上进一步对教学、科学研究、生产劳动，以及更好地发挥教师作用、关怀师生生活等作了全面的安排。
    去年一年，上海各高等学校在贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合方针的过程中，成百上千的教师、学生深入到工厂、农村、山区、海洋从事生产劳动，同时进行科学研究，掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的教育大革命，开始改变了这些学校过去忽视政治、脱离生产劳动、脱离实际的情况，转变了学风，创造了多种联系实际的群众路线的教学方法，这些方法有许多已开始推广。为了坚持教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，最近，各学校原则上规定学生每年以三个月的时间参加生产劳动，八个月学习，一个月假期。不同的系科和专业的教学或生产劳动时间，还可以适当调节。
    新教学计划强调高等学校学生参加生产劳动和科学研究内容必须尽可能与所学专业结合起来。三个月劳动时间中，除有一个月左右参加工农业生产和其他义务劳动外，另外两个月时间可以集中或是分散地结合专业下乡下厂，一面参加生产劳动，一面进行现场教学和科学研究。各校按照不同专业和不同年级对学生参加生产劳动都提出不同的要求。例如一、二、三年级的理、工科学生，经过劳动要熟悉专业的生产知识和学会基本操作；高年级学生则要求在熟悉操作技术之外，能够独立地完成一定的工艺设计或是负担一部分科学研究任务，使学生在毕业时既有系统的专业理论知识，又有实际生产技能。文、史科学生到工厂、农村参加生产劳动时，一边劳动，一边结合专业进行调查研究和学习，如采集和研究民歌，编写工厂史、人民公社史，从事社会经济调查等。
    在课程安排中，各校都注意了加强基础课和理论课的教学。很多学校删改了原来基础课内容中重复、过时及不确当的部分，增加了反映近代科学成就的新的学科。复旦大学的物理、化学、数学等系已决定在下学期开出近代化学实验技术等新的基础课。华东师范大学地理系把原来的普通自然地理课按照不同的内容，分为天文学、气象气温学、水文学和地貌学及第四纪地质学等课程。这些安排都是为了使学生获得更加完备的基本理论知识。此外，有的学校还新增加了自然地理学基本问题、经济地理导论以及和人民公社发展有密切关系的人民公社经济调查等新课，使学生在学习之后，可以进行小区域的综合调查。
    各学校除了将继续结合各种政治运动和生产劳动对学生进行政治思想教育外，同时还要开始系统的政治理论课，并规定每周大约有一天的时间进行社会主义、共产主义思想教育和讲授政治理论课。有的学校已开设辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义和政治经济学两门课程。
    对于科学研究，在保证完成教学任务的前提下，各校初步确定要负担一部分国家交给的科学研究任务和培养质量较高的干部，把尖端科学的研究、解决生产实际问题的研究与教学工作结合起来，做到既能很好完成国家交给的科学研究任务，又能不断地提高教学质量。华东师范大学地理系师生确定以后每年拿出一定的时间和力量接受国家任务，到野外调查研究祖国资源状况，同时进行现场教学和生产劳动。复旦大学、交通大学、同济大学等条件较好的学校，都准备在学校自办的工厂中结合教学开展尖端科学技术的研究和进行试验性、中间性生产，为上海工业发展服务。
    课堂教学仍然作为各校教学的主要形式被提出来，同时要注意到与现场教学相结合，凡是适宜于进行现场教学的课程，尽可能结合生产劳动搬到现场上去讲授。在教学工作中，许多学校都确定了既要注意发挥教师的主导作用，也要注意发挥学生在学习上的主动性、积极性。同时，注意吸收有丰富经验的工人、农民、土专家和实际工作干部参加教学，使理论和实践、教学和生产更紧密地联系起来。
    在各校新的教学计划中，还充分注意了师生的休息和文娱体育活动的安排，保证师生每天有八小时的睡眠时间和四到六小时的吃饭、文娱活动、体育锻炼时间。对教师备课和进修所必需的时间也作了安排，对体弱的和年老的教师生活上给予必要的照顾。各校最近还分别对校内的食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业加强了领导和管理，使师生更好地工作、学习和生活。
