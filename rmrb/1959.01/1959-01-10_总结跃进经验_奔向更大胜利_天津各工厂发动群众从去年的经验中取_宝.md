Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 9th: Tianjin's factories and enterprises are extensively mobilizing their workers to scientifically analyze and summarize the experiences of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, further consolidating the rich achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and laying a good foundation for achieving an even greater leap forward this year.

In 1958, Tianjin witnessed an unprecedentedly good new situation in industrial production due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward" and "walking on two legs." The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that through the practice of the past year, the broad masses of workers have gained a deeper understanding of the Party's general line for socialist construction and have created rich experiences. Comprehensively summarizing and elevating these scattered and fragmented understandings and experiences will play a very good role in guiding future and even greater leaps forward. The Municipal Committee believes that while summing up by leading cadres and a few full-time personnel is indeed a necessary method, it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the current situation. The Municipal Committee has decided to extensively mobilize the masses of workers in factories and enterprises throughout the city to summarize the achievements, shortcomings, and experiences in production management, work methods, and political and ideological work from their personal experiences. At the same time, such a summary will also be a vivid socialist and communist education for cadres and workers.

After mobilization by Party organizations at all levels, a mass summary movement has rapidly and vigorously unfolded in factories and enterprises throughout the city. Many factories first mobilized workers for general airing of views and debates, analyzing, synthesizing, and elevating the fragmented and scattered feelings and experiences put forward by each person. Then, based on the specific situation of the factory or workshop, they focused on prominent issues and entered into special airing of views and debates, finally summarizing the experiences. Many leading cadres went deep into the workshops and teams, airing views together with the workers, providing guidance and inspiration at any time.

In big-character posters and aired opinions, workers listed many vivid facts, illustrating the brilliant achievements of 1958. They affirmed the tremendous role played by mass movements, technological revolution, and the implementation of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" under the leadership of the Party in the Great Leap Forward in production. They understood the main reasons for achieving achievements and the direction of future efforts, further boosting their enthusiasm and revolutionary vigor for socialist construction. When recalling the reasons for the more than doubling of production in 1958, the workers of the Ink Manufacturing Factory realized that vigorously carrying out the technological revolution and combining hard work with ingenuity were important keys to achieving achievements. Therefore, during the summary process, they made rationalization proposals based on this experience. In the last ten days of last year, they had already put forward more than 200 technical innovation proposals, and more than 20 of them have been implemented. At the same time, they identified the shortcomings in the leap forward and overcame them, which further increased the daily output of ink. The workers of the Ink Grinding Team of this factory raised the question in the summary: Why is it that their team's equipment and technical strength are stronger than other teams, but the production tasks cannot always be completed? After recalling, discussing, and analyzing, the team summarized that the main reason was that some people did not cooperate enough with each other and did not implement technical measures quickly enough. The whole team put forward improvement measures to address these shortcomings and launched a competition between shifts, quickly changing the backward state. The Hui Fu Pharmaceutical Factory needed 7,000 sets of tablet pressing dies every year, which were processed by outside factories. This often affected production due to untimely supply. After analyzing this problem, the workers in the affiliated workshop believed that the factory must rely on its own efforts to solve this problem. Therefore, they took the initiative to make their own machine tools, and they searched for blueprints and painstakingly studied, and now they have manufactured a four-and-a-half-foot lathe. They also plan to build 13 machines, including a gantry planer and a shaper, in 1959 to arm themselves to ensure a greater leap forward this year.

In the mass summary movement, workers extensively carried out criticism and self-criticism, and the democratic atmosphere in the factories became even stronger. Many big-character posters praised advanced figures, praising their advanced deeds of daring to think and daring to act, and of loving the factory as their home, further establishing role models among the workers, thus setting off a new upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Some big-character posters criticized the work style of a few cadres and the shortcomings of some workers in their thinking and work. After the Fourth Glass Factory exhibited the advanced deeds of workers Li Jianhua, Dai Deyu, and others at the Great Leap Forward exhibition, who worked hard, diligently researched, and loved the factory as their home during the Great Leap Forward, the workers of the whole factory learned from them. Young workers Yu Wenzhang, Li Hechun, Zhang Zhizhi, and others were inspired and educated by the exhibition, actively studied technology, and with the help of experienced workers, have successfully trial-produced a high-grade glass fiber. Many cadres were once again tempered in the summary and accepted the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the workers, further improving their leadership style and strengthening their ties with the masses.

On the basis of summarizing last year's Great Leap Forward, many factories and enterprises are mobilizing workers to widely discuss the production plan for the first quarter of this year. Based on last year's experience, workers are further grasping the key, putting forward measures and rationalization proposals, and realizing this year's greater leap forward with the spirit of doing practical work, hard work, and skillful work.

Forward with "Treasures"

In 1958, we realized an unprecedented Great Leap Forward on the industrial front. In 1959, we will have an even more magnificent leap forward.

How to meet this greater leap forward? How to strive for this greater victory?

For the soldiers on the industrial front, the most important thing is to better arm themselves ideologically. The Party's general line for socialist construction and the whole set of policies of walking on two legs have proven in the great practice of 1958 to be invaluable treasures that guide us to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. Everyone should come together to summarize the construction experience of 1958, so that they can have a deeper understanding of this "treasure" and learn how to use this "treasure" better. In this way, we will become smarter and more powerful, and we will be more confident of winning in the new year.

To summarize the construction experience of 1958, it is necessary to fully mobilize the broad masses to participate. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 was achieved through the practice of millions of people; the new great leap forward in 1959 still needs to be practiced by millions of people. Therefore, only when the masses rise up to summarize can it be deep, broad, and able to educate the masses themselves, and turn all valuable experiences into favorable conditions for continuing to move forward.

Let us carry the "treasure" forward and achieve greater victories!

    总结跃进经验　奔向更大胜利
    天津各工厂发动群众从去年的经验中取“宝”
    新华社天津9日电　天津市各工厂企业正在广泛发动职工群众，对1958年大跃进的经验进行科学分析和总结，进一步巩固大跃进的丰富成果，为实现今年的更大跃进打下良好基础。
    1958年天津市由于认真贯彻执行了“以钢为纲、全面跃进”以及“两条腿走路”的方针，工业生产上出现了空前好的新局面。中共天津市委认为，通过一年来的实践，广大职工对于党的社会主义建设总路线有了更深刻的体会，并且创造了丰富的经验，把这些分散的、片断的体会和经验加以综合、总结和提高，对指导今后的更大跃进将起很好的作用。市委认为，由领导干部和少数专职人员去总结，固然是一种必要的方法，但仅仅如此，还不能适应目前形势的需要。市委决定在全市工厂企业中广泛发动职工群众，从切身体会中总结生产管理上、工作方法上和政治思想工作上的成绩、缺点和经验；同时，这样的总结，对干部和职工也是一次生动的社会主义和共产主义教育。
    经过各级党组织的动员，目前一个群众性的总结运动已迅速在全市工厂企业中轰轰烈烈展开。许多工厂先发动职工一般地鸣放辩论，把每个人提出的片断的、分散的感受和体验进行分析、综合和提高，然后根据本厂或本车间的具体情况，抓住突出的问题，转入专题鸣放辩论，最后把经验总结起来。不少领导干部都深入到车间、小组，同职工一起鸣放，随时进行辅导和启发。
    职工们在大字报和鸣放意见中，列举出许多生动事实，说明1958年的辉煌成就；肯定了在党的领导下，采取大搞群众运动、开展技术革命和实行“两参一改三结合”等办法，对生产大跃进所起的巨大作用；了解到获得成就的主要原因和今后努力的方向，更加鼓足了社会主义建设的热情和革命干劲。油墨制造厂的职工们，在回忆1958年生产提高两倍以上的原因时，体会到大搞技术革命，苦干和巧干相结合，是获得成就的重要关键之一，因此，他们在总结过程中，就根据这一经验，纷纷提合理化建议，在去年年底十多天的时间内就已提出技术革新建议二百多件，有二十多件已经实现；同时他们找出了跃进中的缺点，加以克服，使油墨的日产量又有了提高。这个厂轧墨一组的工人，在总结中提出：为什么自己小组的设备和技术力量比别组强，而生产任务总不能完成？小组经过回忆、讨论、分析，总结出主要原因是有些人互相协作不够、贯彻技术措施不快等等。全组就针对这些缺点提出了改进办法，并且开展班与班之间的竞赛，迅速改变了落后状态。惠符制药厂每年需要的七千套压片冲模都是由外厂加工的，往往由于供应不及时而影响到生产，附属车间的工人们分析了这一问题以后，认为必须由本厂自力更生，解决这个问题，于是他们主动提出要自制机床，并且到处找图纸、刻苦钻研，现在已经制造出一台四尺半的旋床。他们还规划在1959年内自造龙门刨、牛头刨等十三台来武装自己，以保证今年的更大跃进。
    在群众性的总结运动中，职工们广泛地开展批评与自我批评，工厂民主空气更加浓厚。许多大字报表扬了先进人物，歌颂他们敢想、敢干的先进事迹，在职工中进一步树立起榜样，从而掀起一个比先进、学先进、赶先进的新热潮。有些大字报对少数干部的作风和某些职工的思想上、工作上的缺点提出了批评。第四玻璃厂在跃进展览会上展出工人李建华、戴德裕等在大跃进中任劳任怨、刻苦钻研和爱厂如家的先进事迹以后，全厂工人纷纷学习。青年工人于文章、李和春、章振芝等受到展览会的启发和教育，积极钻研技术，在老师傅帮助下，已试制成功一种高级玻璃纤维。许多干部在总结中又一次受到锻炼，接受工人们提出的批评建议，进一步改进领导作风，密切了同群众的关系。
    许多工厂企业在总结去年大跃进的基础上，正发动职工广泛讨论今年第一季度的生产计划。职工们根据去年的经验，进一步抓关键，提措施和合理化建议，以实干、苦干、巧干的精神来实现今年的更大跃进。携“宝”前进
    1958年我们在工业战线上实现了空前的大跃进，1959年我们还要有一个更宏伟的跃进。
    怎样迎接这更大的跃进？怎样争取这更大的胜利？
    工业战线上的战士们，首要的是更好地在思想上武装自己。党的社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的一整套方针，在1958年的伟大实践中，证明了是引导我们多快好省地建设社会主义的无价之宝。大家都来总结1958年的建设经验，就能够更深地领会这个“宝”，学会更好地使用这个“宝”。这样，我们就将变得更聪明，更有力，在新的一年中更有把握稳操胜券。
    总结1958年的建设经验，一定要充分发动广大的群众来参加。1958年的大跃进是通过千百万群众的实践达到的；1959年的新的伟大跃进，仍然要通过千百万群众去实践。因此，只有群众起来总结，才能够深，才能够广，才能够教育群众自己，才能够把一切宝贵的经验变为继续前进的有利条件。
    让我们携“宝”前进，取得更大的胜利！
