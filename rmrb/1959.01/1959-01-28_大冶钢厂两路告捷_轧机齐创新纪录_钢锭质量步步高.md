Wuhan, January 27th (Reported by this newspaper) - Rolling mill workers at the Daye Steel Plant, filled with soaring enthusiasm, are advancing towards technological improvements, progressively increasing production from the newly built primary rolling mill. On the 23rd, they reached a daily output of 1,321 tons of steel billets, exceeding the designed capacity by 11%. On the same day, medium-sized and small rolling mills also rolled out 8,417 tons of steel, surpassing the highest daily output of last year by 91%, marking the first victory for the plant in increasing steel production this year.

The primary rolling mill and medium-sized rolling mill of the Daye Steel Plant are both new equipment that was put into operation at the end of last year. At the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Party branch, the rolling mill workers conducted "on-site rectification," analyzing the current situation as "new personnel, new equipment." They recognized that they must boost their enthusiasm to overcome the "new technology" barrier in order to complete the task of even greater leaps forward this year. Workers of all trades put forward their own goals, and based on production needs, they established a post responsibility system and safety regulations, strictly adhering to production discipline, combining mass movements with division of labor.

This "on-site rectification" has not yet concluded, but everyone has gradually become proficient in operation, initially grasping the rules of how to "load more, burn faster" and make the rolling mill continuously roll without interruption. They have also begun to make improvements in operation and equipment. Furnace workers Zheng Baorong and Jing Xin'an, based on the principle of using gas to cook for urban residents, devised a way to control the ratio of gas to air, changing the old method of preheating the soaking furnace to 500 degrees Celsius with firewood and coke before the gas could be ignited. They now directly use gas to heat the cold soaking furnace, making it both safe and improving the efficiency of the furnace, becoming a national innovation. Operator Li Ligong also devised a way to increase the reduction, reducing the number of passes for 180mm square steel from 17 to 15, improving the capacity of the rolling mill. The medium-sized rolling mill, which only went into production in December last year, has also been explored by the workers to develop the experience of "uneven speeds in the first and fourth passes, with the second pass subordinate to the third pass." Even with insufficient motor power, it can roll three to four steel bars simultaneously. As a result, the daily output of the primary rolling mill has increased from a maximum of over 700 tons last year to 975 tons, and then to 1,321 tons. The output of the medium-sized rolling mill has also increased from 340 tons to 453 tons.

Wuhan, January 27th (Reported by this newspaper) - The First Steelmaking Division of the Daye Steel Plant has adopted the "three-way combination" method, resulting in a monthly increase in steel quality. The quality inspection standards for this year are much stricter than those of the fourth quarter of last year, but as of January 23rd, their quality pass rate has increased from 69% in the fourth quarter to 95%. The average daily amount of good steel produced has also increased from 421 tons to 490 tons, and one-third of it is high-quality steel.

The First Steelmaking Division of the Daye Steel Plant has three medium-sized open-hearth furnaces and one small open-hearth furnace. The medium-sized open-hearth furnaces were all put into operation after June last year, and most of the operators are new workers. Before the equipment was fully adjusted, they encountered the new problem of using local iron to make steel. At that time, the First Steelmaking Division adopted the "three-way combination" method, with leading cadres, technical cadres, and veteran workers forming a technical research group. They finally developed more than ten desulfurization experiences such as "slag gasification sulfur," enabling local iron with a sulfur content of 0.7% to reduce the sulfur content of steel to below 0.12%. The workers also found ways to solve problems such as "steel leakage," and the quality pass rate increased month by month.

From New Year's Day this year, the steel inspection standards were tightened. Although they received foreign iron supplied by the Wuhan Steel Plant, it was all cast local iron unsuitable for alkaline open-hearth furnaces. The quality of the magnesite they received this year was also not ideal. Therefore, while continuing to promote existing desulfurization experiences, they strengthened raw material management and strictly controlled the mixing ratio of foreign iron, local iron, and local steel to ensure that the sulfur and silicon content of the molten iron was not too high. They also organized furnace protection teams to study the experience of high-yield, long-life furnaces and strengthened the drying of furnace repair materials and the maintenance of furnaces. In the first half of January, the daily output of good steel reached 456 tons, and from the 17th to the 23rd, it increased to 513 tons. Currently, they are further studying furnace protection experiences and shortening the time for furnace repair, striving for a leap forward in steel production and quality. (Attached picture)

    大冶钢厂两路告捷
    轧机齐创新纪录　钢锭质量步步高
    本报武汉27日电　大冶钢厂轧钢工人鼓起冲天干劲，向技术进军，使新建的初轧机生产逐步提高，在23日达到日产一千三百二十一吨钢坯，超过设计能力11％；中型与小型轧机也在同天轧出八千四百一十七吨钢材，超过去年最高日产量91％，为该厂今年增产更多的钢材打响了第一炮。
    大冶钢厂的初轧机和中型轧机都是去年年底投入生产的新设备。今年年初，轧钢工人们在党支部领导下进行“战地整风”，分析了当前的情况是“新人员、新设备”，认识到必须鼓足干劲突破“新技术”关，才能完成今年更大跃进的任务。各工种工人都提出自己的奋斗目标，大家又根据生产的需要，建立起岗位专责制和安全规程等制度，严守生产纪律，使群众运动与分工负责相结合。
    这次“战地整风”还没有结束，而大家已在操作上逐步熟练，初步摸到如何“多装、快烧”和使轧机不间隙地连续轧压的规律，并在操作和设备上开始有所改进。炉工郑保荣、景新安根据城市居民用煤气点火做饭的道理，设法控制煤气与空气的比例，将均热炉必须先用木柴、焦炭烤到五百来度才能点燃煤气的旧办法，改为直接用煤气烧烤冷的均热炉，做到既安全，又提高了炉子效力，成为全国创举。操纵工李立功也设法加大压下量，将一百八十公厘的方钢由轧压十七次减为十五次，提高了轧机的能力。去年12月才投入生产的中型轧机，也由工人们摸索出“一挡四挡不等，二挡服从三挡”的经验，在电动机力量不足的条件下，也能同时轧制三根至四根钢条。这样，初轧机就由去年最高日产七百多吨提高为九百七十五吨，再提高为一千三百二十一吨，中型轧机也由三百四十吨提高到四百五十三吨。

    本报武汉27日电　大冶钢厂第一炼钢部采取“三结合”的办法，使钢的质量逐月上升。今年的质量检验标准比去年第四季度严格多了，但截至1月23日止，他们的质量合格率却由第四季度的69％上升为95％，每天平均炼出的好钢数量也由四百二十一吨增加到四百九十吨，并且有三分之一是优质钢。
    大冶钢厂第一炼钢部共有三座中型平炉和一座小型平炉。中型平炉都是在去年6月以后投入生产的，操作的大部分是新工人。设备还没有完全调整好，就遇到了土铁炼钢的新问题。当时，第一炼钢部就采取“三结合”的办法，由领导干部、技术干部和老工人组成技术研究组，终于研究出“渣化气化硫”等十多项去硫的经验，使土铁在含硫0.7％的情况下也能使钢的含硫量降到0.12％以下。工人们还设法解决了“漏钢”等问题，质量合格率逐月上升。
    从今年元旦起，钢的检验标准加严。他们虽然得到了武钢供应的洋铁，但都是不适合碱性平炉的铸造土铁。他们今年得到的镁砂质量也不太理想。于是，他们一面继续推行已有的去硫经验，一面加强原料管理，严格控制洋铁、土铁和土钢的配合比例，使铁水熔化后所含的硫和矽都不太高。他们又组织护炉队到炉子上研究高产长寿的经验，并且加强补炉材料的干燥工作和炉子的维护工作。1月上半月每天炼出的好钢达四百五十六吨，17日到23日又增加到五百一十三吨。目前，他们正在进一步研究护炉经验，缩短补炉和修炉的时间，力争钢的产量和质量再来个飞跃的发展。（附图片）
