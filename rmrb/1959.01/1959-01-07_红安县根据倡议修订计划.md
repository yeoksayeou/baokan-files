Xinhua News Agency report: Cadres and the masses in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, warmly responded to the "Ten Initiatives" proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, resolving to achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Hong'an County achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, with significant increases in grain and peanut production compared to 1957. However, cadres and the masses throughout the county were not satisfied with their existing achievements. Each commune earnestly reviewed and summarized their production experiences from the past year, and based on this, formulated leap forward plans for this year. The "Ten Initiatives" further inspired the vast cadres and masses of Hong'an County's confidence in striving for an even greater leap forward this year. Some communes also checked and revised their leap forward plans for this year according to the requirements of the initiatives. For example, after studying the "Ten Initiatives," the Er'cheng Commune put forward the slogan of "Eight Changes and Eight Additions," namely, revise plans and add measures, revise measures and add drive, improve cultivation techniques and strengthen field management, improve leadership methods and strengthen grassroots leadership, change work styles and strengthen ties with the masses, change the face of industry and strengthen commune industrialization, change commodity production plans and strengthen commodity production, and change institutions and strengthen cultural and health work.

According to the requirements of the "Ten Initiatives," each commune also focused on studying the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, in light of local conditions. The Jiansu Commune decided to increase the number of pigs raised from less than one per capita last year to five. After carefully studying the seventh initiative in the "Ten Initiatives," some communes decided that in addition to further developing self-sufficiency production, they would also greatly develop commodity production to support the country.

On the second day after the members of the Huahe Commune discussed the "Ten Initiatives," more than 13,000 people from the whole commune were mobilized. On that day, they weeded and fertilized more than 2,700 mu of wheat and rapeseed fields, and also accumulated 20,000 dan of fertilizer. Now, they propose to eliminate the third-class seedlings before the Spring Festival.

    红安县根据倡议修订计划
    据新华社讯　湖北红安县广大干部和群众，热烈响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议，决心使今年的农业生产实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
    红安县去年获得了空前的大丰收，粮食和花生都比1957年增产很多。但是全县干部和群众并没有满足于已有的成绩，各公社都认真检查和总结了去年的生产经验，并在这个基础上制定了今年的跃进规划。十大倡议更加鼓舞了红安县广大干部和群众对争取今年更大跃进的信心，有些公社还对照倡议的要求，检查和修订了今年的跃进规划。例如，二程公社在学习了十大倡议以后，就提出了“八改八加”的口号，即改规划加措施，改措施加干劲，改进耕作技术加强田间管理，改进领导方法加强基层领导，改变作风加强联系群众，改变工业面貌加强公社工业化工作，改变商品生产计划加强商品生产，改变机构加强文化卫生工作。
    各公社还根据十大倡议的要求，结合本地具体情况，着重研究了全面发展农林牧副渔的问题。建苏公社决定把养猪数量由去年每人平均不到一头增加到五头。有的公社仔细地学习了十大倡议中的第七项倡议后，决定除进一步发展自给性生产以外，还要大大发展商品性生产，以支援国家。
    华河公社社员讨论十大倡议的第二天，全社出动了一万三千多人，这一天他们在二千七百多亩小麦、油菜地里锄了草，追了肥，另外还积了两万担肥料。现在，他们提出要把三类苗消灭在春节前。
