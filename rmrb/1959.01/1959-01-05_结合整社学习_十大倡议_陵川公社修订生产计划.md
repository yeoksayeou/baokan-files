Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th - Cadres and members of the Lingchuan People's Commune in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, are enthusiastically responding to the Ten Initiatives proposed by the representatives of advanced units in national agricultural socialist construction. After reading the initiatives, the commune's Party committee immediately convened a meeting to study and revise this year's plan for the all-round development of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. At the same time, in conjunction with current production and rectification, it launched activities to publicize, study, and discuss the Ten Initiatives throughout the commune.

Lingchuan Commune is located on the highest peak of the Taihang Mountains and is known as the "Roof of Taihang." In 1958, this commune experienced a great leap forward in production, showing a prosperous scene of abundant harvests and thriving livestock. Therefore, they had representatives attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction.

This year, the commune is determined to plant the red flag of the Great Leap Forward even higher in the Taihang Mountains. According to the plan, this year the commune will develop industry according to local conditions, and the total industrial output value of the commune will increase fourfold compared to 1958. At the same time, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will be comprehensively developed and make an all-round leap forward. In addition to the 320,000 mu of "basic farmland" concentrated on grain production to ensure continued growth in grain output, the commune has also designated 40% of the general cultivated land for the development of cash crops. It is necessary to densely plant and cultivate 950,000 mu of young forests, planting more than 70 million walnut, apple, pear, grape, jujube, persimmon, and other dried fruit trees. The number of large livestock will increase by 20% compared to last year, with each person raising an average of two pigs. It is also necessary to vigorously develop silkworm breeding, raising poultry, rabbits, and bees, as well as developing transportation, mountain products, medicinal materials, and other sideline productions. With the development of water conservancy construction, fisheries will be vigorously developed, with a plan to raise 5 million fish, ensuring that every reservoir and pond raises fish. According to this comprehensive development plan for diversified operations, the self-sufficient production and commodity production of Lingchuan Commune in 1959 will be greatly developed compared to last year, and the income of the commune and its members will increase significantly.

In order to realize the above plan and respond to the Ten Initiatives with practical actions, the commune leaders are, while leading the members in discussing the Ten Initiatives, launching and organizing a red flag competition centered on doing a good job in current production and rectification.

    结合整社学习“十大倡议”
    陵川公社修订生产计划
    新华社太原4日电　山西晋城县陵川人民公社干部和社员热烈响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议。公社党委看了倡议以后，立即召开会议，研究修订了今年工业和农林牧付渔全面发展的计划，同时结合当前生产和整社，在全社展开了宣传、学习和讨论十大倡议的活动。
    陵川公社地处太行山区的最高峰，有“太行屋脊”之称。1958年这个社生产大跃进，出现了五谷丰登、六畜兴旺的繁荣气象。因此，他们有代表出席了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。
    今年，这个公社决心把跃进的红旗在太行山区插得更高。按照规划，今年公社将根据当地条件因地制宜地发展工业，全社工业总产值将要比1958年增长四倍。同时农林牧副渔将要综合发展，全面跃进。全社除了三十二万亩“基本农田”集中生产粮食，保证粮食产量继续增长以外，还确定40％的一般耕地发展经济作物。要加密补植和培育幼林九十五万亩，种核桃、苹果、梨、葡萄、枣、柿以及其他干果树七千多万株。大牲畜要比去年增长20％，每人平均养到二口猪。还要大力发展养蚕，养家禽、家兔、养蜂，以及发展运输、山货、药材等副业生产。随着水利建设的发展，大量发展渔业，计划养鱼五百万尾，作到库库养鱼、池池养鱼。按照这个综合发展多种经营的规划，1959年陵川公社自给性生产和商品性生产都将比去年大大发展，公社和社员的收入将有显著增加。
    为了实现上述规划，以实际行动响应十大倡议，公社领导方面在领导社员讨论十大倡议的同时，正在发动和组织以搞好当前生产和整社为内容的红旗竞赛。
