    Emphasize Hygiene to Welcome the Spring Festival
    The Hygiene Red Flag Street in Shenyang City - Chaoyang Street in Shenhe District, further developed winter hygiene and epidemic prevention work in conjunction with the masses' tradition of sweeping away dust before the Spring Festival over the years. Now, the snow on the streets and in the courtyards has been cleared, and the streets and alleys appear particularly clean. Residents are busy dismantling and washing bedding, and cleaning up their environment to prepare for a clean and tidy Spring Festival.

    Resident Granny Wang Shuxian and her daughter are cleaning, ensuring bright windows and clean surfaces.

    When the weather is mild and sunny, the nursery school aunts take the children outdoors to engage in activities and breathe fresh air. Residents are taking advantage of the sunny weather to dismantle and wash a lot of bedding.
