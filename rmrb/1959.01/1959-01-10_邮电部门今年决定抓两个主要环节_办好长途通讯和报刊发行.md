Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently held a national postal and telecommunications conference in Beijing to arrange work for 1959. The conference required all levels of postal and telecommunications departments to, under the unwavering premise of serving the Party's central work and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, continue to implement the principle of prioritizing long-distance communication in telecommunications and newspaper distribution in postal services, focusing on the construction of communication organizations and the postal and telecommunications industry, and further accelerate the development of China's postal and telecommunications services.

In terms of telecommunications, the conference decided that in 1959, it would actively strengthen the technical transformation of the long-distance communication network. There should be more increases in the number of long-distance telecommunication circuits from Beijing to each province (autonomous region), from province to prefecture, and from prefecture to county. Modern cable and microwave communication equipment should begin to be constructed on major trunk lines. To this end, the postal and telecommunications departments will closely cooperate with relevant industrial departments under the overall plan of the state to develop the communications industry and actively develop the postal and telecommunications industry. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will vigorously expand and build new factories capable of manufacturing cables, carrier wave machines, and other communication equipment. Local postal and telecommunications departments and postal and telecommunications colleges and schools should also consolidate, reorganize, and expand existing factories according to needs and conditions. The technical revolution and scientific research work of the postal and telecommunications departments will also be widely carried out around the needs of postal and telecommunications production and construction. While facing the current needs of postal and telecommunications and construction, we will focus on cutting-edge technology—striving to solve the technical problems of cable and microwave communications, so that communication equipment can be continuously improved and reach a modern level.

In terms of postal services, in 1959, we must vigorously solve the problem of postal transportation, strive to increase the proportion of "three deliveries on the same day" for newspaper distribution (central newspapers arriving in provinces on the same day, provincial newspapers arriving in counties on the same day, and county newspapers arriving in communes on the same day), so that Party newspapers and Party publications can be delivered in a timely manner. With the timely delivery of newspapers and periodicals, the speed of delivery of letters and other mails can also be accelerated. In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, we must improve the organization of postal transportation, rationally adjust postal routes, increase the frequency of postal transportation, actively tap the potential of existing equipment, and rely on local support to solve possible transportation tool problems. At the same time, under the leadership of the local Party committee, we must obtain the support of the transportation departments to closely connect the transportation processes of trains and automobiles. In internal operations, we must actively carry out tool reforms to improve work efficiency and reduce heavy physical labor.

In addition, the postal and telecommunications institutions of the people's communes should be established and consolidated, leadership should be strengthened, specialized postal and telecommunications personnel should be trained, and political and ideological work and business and technical management should be strengthened.

    邮电部门今年决定抓两个主要环节
    办好长途通讯和报刊发行
    新华社9日讯　邮电部最近在北京召开全国邮电会议布置1959年工作。会议要求各级邮电部门必须在坚持不渝地为党的中心工作服务、为工农业大跃进服务的前提下，继续贯彻电讯以长途通讯为纲、邮政以报刊发行为纲，抓住通讯组织建设和邮电工业建设，进一步加速我国邮电事业的发展。
    在电讯方面，会议决定1959年将积极加强长途通讯网路的技术改造，从北京到各省（自治区）、省到专区和专区到县的长途电讯电路要有更多的增加，在主要干线上要开始建设现代化的电缆和微波通讯设备。为此，邮电部门将在国家发展通讯工业的整体规划下，与有关工业部门密切配合协作，积极发展邮电工业。邮电部将大力扩建和新建能够制造电缆、载波机与其他通讯设备的工厂，各地邮电部门和邮电学院、邮电学校也要根据需要和条件，整顿、巩固和扩建原有的工厂。邮电部门的技术革命和科学研究工作也将围绕邮电生产建设的需要广泛地开展。在面向当前邮电通讯和建设需要的同时，力攻尖端技术——努力解决电缆和微波通讯技术问题，使通讯设备不断提高，达到现代化水平。
    在邮政方面，1959年要大力解决邮政运输问题，努力提高报刊发行“三到”（中央报纸当天到省、省报当天到县、县报当天到达公社）的比重，使党报、党刊及时地传递下去。随着报刊的及时传递，信函和其它邮件的传递速度也就能够加快。为了解决这个问题，一方面要改进邮政运输的组织工作，合理调整邮路，加密邮政运输的班期，积极挖掘现有设备的潜力，并依靠地方上帮助解决可能解决的运输工具问题。同时还要在地方党委的领导下，取得交通运输部门的支持，使火车、汽车的运输过程紧密地衔接起来。在内部操作上，要积极进行工具改革，提高工作效率，减轻笨重的体力劳动。
    此外，应把人民公社的邮电机构建立和巩固起来，加强领导，培养邮电专门人材，加强政治思想工作和业务技术管理。
