Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: Over two hundred newly built small-scale sugar factories in Shanxi Province have already begun production using indigenous methods. Under normal circumstances, each factory can process 10,000 jin of sugar beets per day, producing over 1,100 jin of brown and white sugar. Currently, over one hundred more small sugar factories are under construction throughout the province.

Two months ago, the sugar industry in Shanxi Province was virtually non-existent, with the large amounts of sugar needed each year relying on state allocation. To change this situation, the Light Industry and Commercial Departments of Shanxi Province, based on the province's sugar beet resources, vigorously mobilized the masses to start operations using indigenous methods, quickly building hundreds of sugar factories utilizing old houses, warehouses, and some substitute equipment. In December of last year, the Provincial Light Industry Department also convened a provincial on-site meeting on indigenous sugar production, promoting some of the better experiences, which rapidly increased the sugar extraction rate of indigenous sugar production throughout the province.

These indigenous sugar factories all use sugar beets as raw material. Shanxi Province has abundant sugar beet resources; last year, the province planted over 100,000 mu, with a total output of over 240 million jin.

    山西建厂二百多  土法生产红白糖
    新华社太原27日电　山西省新建的二百多个土法小型制糖厂已经投入生产。按照正常情况，每个厂一天可以处理甜菜一万斤，产红糖、白糖一千一百多斤。目前，全省还有一百多个小糖厂正在兴建中。
    两个月以前，山西省制糖工业还是个空白点，每年需要的大量食糖都依靠国家调拨。为了改变这种情况，山西省轻工业部门和商业部门根据全省甜菜资源，大力发动群众用土法先上马，利用旧房屋、仓库和一些代用设备，迅速兴建起几百个制糖厂。省轻工业部门去年12月还召开全省土法制糖现场会议，推广了一些较好的经验，使全省土法制糖的出糖率迅速提高。
    这批土法制糖厂都以甜菜为原料。山西省甜菜资源丰富，去年全省就种植十万多亩，总产量达二亿四千多万斤。
