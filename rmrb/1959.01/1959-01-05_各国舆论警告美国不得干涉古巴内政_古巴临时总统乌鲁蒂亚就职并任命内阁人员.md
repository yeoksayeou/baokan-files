Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: The collapse of Batista's dictatorial regime in Cuba has received widespread attention from world public opinion. Newspapers in many countries have published commentaries, hailing the great victory achieved by the Cuban people in their struggle. Many newspapers have also sternly condemned the US attempt to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.

The "Neues Deutschland" published a commentary on January 3 regarding the escape of Cuban dictator Batista from Cuba, saying that this was a serious defeat for the United States at the beginning of the new year. The commentary, after denouncing the United States for sending warships in an attempt to interfere, pointed out: All the means of the Washington colonialists cannot change the basic fact that the era of using Wall Street's hired puppets to decide the path of Latin America is gone forever.

Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" wrote in its commentary on the Cuban event on January 3, "Regardless of how the Cuban event develops in the future, it can be said with certainty today that the collapse of the Batista dictatorship is a major victory for the Cuban people, and it once again demonstrates the desire of the people of Latin American countries for liberation."

Romania's "Scinteia" published a commentary on January 3, saying that this great victory of the Cuban people is a serious blow to the ruling group in the United States.

Bulgaria's "Rabotnichesko Delo" condemned the United States' attempt to armed intervention in Cuba's internal affairs on January 3, saying: If US imperialism dares to use the pretext of protecting the interests of US companies to armed intervention in Cuba's civil war, it will once again expose its ugly face to the people of the world. The people of all countries in the world will never turn a blind eye to this crude act of aggression by US imperialism.

Cairo's "Al Shaab" commented on the Cuban situation in its "World Politics" column on January 3. When talking about Washington's concern about the fate of the pro-American Cuban government, it said that this is not only because the United States' interests in Cuba will be affected by the revolution, but also because this revolution seriously affects the United States' position and prestige in the entire Western Hemisphere. The newspaper expressed its belief that American public opinion would consider the current situation in Cuba as a new failure of Dulles' foreign policy, and that the United States would take a series of measures to prevent similar revolutions from happening in this region.

Jakarta's "Sin Po" published an editorial on January 3, severely condemning the United States for interfering in Cuba's internal affairs.

The editorial pointed out that the United States has supported military regimes in some Latin American countries. The editorial quoted reports saying that after the establishment of the Cuban Military Committee, the United States discussed sending armed forces to Cuba to suppress the Cuban people's uprising, just as it did in Lebanon in the past. The editorial pointed out that the military regimes supported by the United States in some Latin American countries cannot solve the domestic problems of these countries. On the contrary, the military regimes have made the situation in these countries chaotic.

The collapse of Batista's bloody dictatorial regime in Cuba has aroused widespread comment in Parisian newspapers. Even reactionary newspapers have had to admit that the Batista regime was only supported by the US Embassy in Havana, and the Cuban people hated it.

"Paris Journal" wrote that the victory over the Batista dictatorial group, like a death knell for this regime, rang throughout Cuba. Under this regime, American financial groups and businessmen forced Cuba to implement their own laws.

French progressive newspapers warmly celebrated the downfall of the anti-people Batista regime. "L'Humanité" wrote: "We sincerely congratulate the victory of the small but very heroic Cuban people. This victory has shaken the imperialist world."

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: According to a TASS report from Buenos Aires on January 3rd: The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party issued a statement on the Cuban situation on January 3rd. The statement said that the collapse of Batista's bloody dictatorial regime, a running dog of US imperialism, is applauded not only by the Cuban people, but also by all the people of Latin America and the world.

The statement then pointed out that the victory of the Cuban people is a powerful blow to US imperialism. Batista's bloody dictatorial regime was supported by the US and British imperialist governments in every possible way until the last moment. But despite this, the people's uprising crushed it. The statement went on to say that American imperialism tries to put on a posture of an "almighty giant" in front of the people of the countries it has ruled or attempted to rule. But the Cuban incident once again shows that this "giant" is powerless in front of the people who have united and are determined to fight for freedom, happiness and national independence.

The Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party emphasized that the struggle in Cuba is not over. Domestic reactionary forces in Cuba and US imperialism will exert pressure on the new government. The statement called on the people of Latin American countries to unite and fight against the common oppressor, US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: Havana News: Manuel Urrutia, nominated by Cuban rebel leader Castro as the interim president of Cuba, was officially inaugurated in Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province, last night and appointed the cabinet members of the Cuban interim government. It is reported that Urrutia used to be a judge in Oriente Province. He was dismissed by former dictator Batista in 1955 for refusing to sentence a group of arrested rebel personnel, and was forced to flee to the United States in 1957 to seek refuge. Urrutia did not return to Cuba until recently.

The ceremony of Urrutia's inauguration as interim president of Cuba was held at Oriente University in Santiago. After taking office, Urrutia appointed Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and Roberto Agramonte, the former leader of the Cuban People's Party and once a presidential candidate, as the Minister of State. Other ministers appointed to senior positions in the interim cabinet include: Angel Fernandez as Minister of Justice, Raul Chibas as Minister of Finance, Raul Cepero Bonilla as Minister of Commerce, Julio Martinez as Minister of Health, and Manuel Fernandez as Minister of Labor.

Urrutia delivered a short speech at his inauguration. He pointed out that the days of the American people getting rid of the rule of tyrants have come, and some remaining dictators in Latin America will be overthrown. The news said that the new government will restore the constitutional guarantees suspended by the Batista dictatorial regime, protect the people's freedom of publication and workers' rights. The new government will also punish officials of the former dictatorial government who have committed crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th: Havana News: Cuban rebels are arresting and executing some officers of the former Batista dictatorial regime who have committed serious crimes.

It is reported that Eulogio Cantillo, the head of the "Military Committee" who took power after dictator Batista fled, was arrested on the 3rd for violating his promise to peacefully transfer Havana to the rebels. The news said that Cantillo betrayed the plan of the armed forces to join the rebels at a critical moment, and at the same time allowed dictator Batista and a group of his accomplices to abscond and take away 300 million US dollars.

According to Agence France-Presse, the rebels who captured Santa Clara, the capital of Las Villas Province, executed Colonel Joaquin Casillas Lumpuy, Batista's military commander of Santa Clara, on the 3rd after a military court trial. When the Cuban rebels attacked Santa Clara, Lumpuy requested dictator Batista to send the air force to bombard indiscriminately, resulting in nearly 3,000 deaths. The news said that the Santa Clara Military Court of the rebels also executed several other war criminals.

It is reported that Betancourt, the representative of the rebels in the United States, stated in Washington on the 2nd that all officials of the dictatorial government who have committed crimes should be tried. He said: "Even if these people have fled to the United States or other countries, they must be brought back for trial." (Attached picture)

    各国舆论警告美国不得干涉古巴内政
    古巴临时总统乌鲁蒂亚就职并任命内阁人员
    本报综合报道　古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的垮台，受到了世界舆论的普遍重视。很多国家的报纸发表评论，欢呼古巴人民在斗争中所取得的这一巨大胜利。不少报纸还对美国企图干涉古巴内政的阴谋进行了严正的谴责。
    “新德意志报”3日就古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔逃出古巴的事件发表评论说，这是跨进新年的时候，美国遭到的一次严重失败。评论在斥责美国派出军舰企图进行干涉后指出：华盛顿殖民主义者的种种手段都不能改变这一基本事实，这就是用华尔街雇佣的傀儡来决定拉丁美洲道路的时代已经一去不复返了。
    波兰“人民论坛报”3日评论古巴事件时写道，“不管古巴事件今后发展如何，今天可以肯定地说，巴蒂斯塔独裁制度的垮台是古巴人民的重大胜利，它再一次表明了拉丁美洲各国人民要求解放的愿望。”
    罗马尼亚“火花报”3日发表评论说，古巴人民的这一伟大胜利是对美国统治集团的严重打击。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”在3日谴责美国企图武装干涉古巴内政说：如果美帝国主义敢于借口保护美国公司的利益而武装干涉古巴的内战，它就会再一次在全世界人民面前暴露它的狰狞面目。世界上各国人民绝不会对美帝国主义这种粗暴的侵略罪行置若罔闻。
    开罗“人民报”3日在它的“世界政治”专栏中评论古巴局势。在谈到华盛顿对亲美的古巴政府的遭遇表示忧虑时说，这不仅是因为美国在古巴的利益会受到革命的影响，而且是因为这个革命严重地影响了美国在整个西半球的地位和威信。这家报纸表示相信，美国舆论会认为古巴目前的局势是杜勒斯制订的外交政策的新的失败，而且美国会采取一系列的措施防止在这个地区发生类似的革命。
    雅加达“东星报”3日发表社论，严厉谴责美国干涉古巴内政。
    社论指出，美国在拉丁美洲某些国家里扶植了军事政权。社论援引报道说，在古巴军事委员会成立以后，美国就讨论派遣武装部队到古巴去镇压古巴人民的起义，就像它过去在黎巴嫩所干的一样。社论指出，美国在拉丁美洲某些国家中扶植的军事政权并不能解决这些国家的国内问题，恰恰相反，军事政权使得这些国家的情况混乱不堪。
    古巴巴蒂斯塔血腥独裁政权的垮台引起巴黎报纸的广泛评论。甚至反动报纸也不得不承认，巴蒂斯塔政权只受到美国驻哈瓦那大使馆的支持，而古巴人民是憎恨它的。
    “巴黎日报”写道，对巴蒂斯塔独裁集团的胜利，像为这个政权送葬的丧钟一样，响彻了全古巴。在这个政权下美国财阀和商人强使古巴实行自己的法律。
    法国进步报刊热烈庆贺反人民的巴蒂斯塔政权倒台。“人道报”写道：“我们衷心庆贺人口不多但是非常英勇的古巴人民的胜利。这个胜利震撼了帝国主义世界。”
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯3日讯：阿根廷共产党中央委员会3日发表了关于古巴局势的声明。声明说，对于美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔的血腥独裁政权的垮台，不仅古巴人民，而且全体拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民都拍手称快。
    声明接着指出，古巴人民的胜利是对美帝国主义的有力打击。巴蒂斯塔的血腥独裁政权直到最后一刻还受到美英帝国主义政府千方百计的支持。但是尽管如此，人民起义还是粉碎了它。声明接着说，美国帝国主义在它已统治或企图建立统治的国家人民面前，力图装出一副“万能巨人”的姿态。但是古巴事件再一次表明，在已经团结起来并坚决为自由、幸福和民族独立而斗争的人民面前，这个“巨人”是没有力量的。
    阿根廷共产党中央委员会强调指出，古巴的斗争还没有结束。古巴国内的反动势力和美国帝国主义将对新政府施加压力。声明号召拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来，为反对共同的压迫者美帝国主义而斗争。
    新华社4日讯　哈瓦那消息：由古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗提名为古巴临时总统的曼努埃尔·乌鲁蒂亚昨天晚上在奥连特省的省会圣地亚哥正式就任，并且任命了古巴临时政府的内阁成员。据报道，乌鲁蒂亚曾经担任过奥连特省的法官，他在1955年由于不肯判处一批被捕的起义军人员而被前独裁者巴蒂斯塔解除了职务，并在1957年被迫逃到美国避难。乌鲁蒂亚一直到最近才返回古巴的。
    乌鲁蒂亚就任古巴临时总统的仪式是在圣地亚哥的奥连特大学举行的。乌鲁蒂亚在就任后任命了古巴起义军领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗为武装部队总司令，而由前古巴人民党领袖、一度是总统候选人的罗伯托·阿格拉蒙特担任国务部长。被任命为临时内阁高级职位的其他一些部长有：安赫尔·费尔南德思为司法部长，劳尔·奇巴斯为财政部长，劳尔·塞佩罗·博尼亚为商业部长，胡利奥·马丁内兹为卫生部长，曼努埃尔·费尔南德思为劳工部长。
    乌鲁蒂亚在就职时发表了简短演说。他指出，美洲人民摆脱暴君统治的日子已经来到了，拉丁美洲一些残存的独裁者都将被推翻。消息说，新政府将恢复被巴蒂斯塔独裁政权停止了的宪法保证，保障人民出版自由和工人权利。新政府还将惩办那些犯有罪行的前独裁政府的官员。
    新华社4日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴起义军正在逮捕和处决一些犯有严重罪行的前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的军官。
    据报道，独裁者巴蒂斯塔逃亡后执政的“军事委员会”首脑欧洛希奥·坎蒂略由于违背了他将哈瓦那和平移交给起义军这一诺言而在三日被捕。消息说，坎蒂略出卖了武装部队在决定性时刻归附起义者的计划，同时让独裁者巴蒂斯塔以及他的一批帮凶潜逃和带走三亿美元。
    另据法新社报道，攻占拉斯维利亚斯省省会圣克拉拉的起义军，经过军事法庭审判以后在三日处决了巴蒂斯塔的圣克拉拉城军事指挥官华金·卡西利亚斯·仑普伊上校。在古巴起义军进攻圣克拉拉时，仑普伊曾经请求独裁者巴蒂斯塔派空军滥施轰炸以致有将近三千人死亡。消息说，起义军圣克拉拉军事法庭还处决了其他几个战争罪犯。
    据报道，起义军在美国的代表贝坦科尔特2日曾在华盛顿表示，一切犯有罪行的独裁政府的官员都应该受到审判。他说：“即使这种人已经逃往美国或其他国家，也必须把他们押回来受审。”（附图片）
