    A Family United Across the Mountains
    (Zhuang Folk Song) Brother lives in Red Plum Village south of the mountain, sister lives in Peach Tree Village north of the mountain. I want to sing a mountain song for my brother to hear, but the high mountain blocks the sound. I want to pick fresh flowers for my brother, but everyone asks questions when I cross the mountains. This year, the advanced cooperative was established, and the people north and south of the mountain are one family. Sooner or later, I can see my lover's face, and my heartfelt words will be truly heard.
    Zhuang, Poem by Wang Damian, Woodcut by Zhao Ruichun (with picture)

    山南山北一家人
    （僮族民歌）哥住山南红梅庄，妹住山北桃树村，想唱山歌叫哥听，高山挡住不透音，想采鲜花送给哥，翻山越岭人人问。今年成立高级社，山南山北一家人，早晚能见情哥面，心里话儿听的真。
