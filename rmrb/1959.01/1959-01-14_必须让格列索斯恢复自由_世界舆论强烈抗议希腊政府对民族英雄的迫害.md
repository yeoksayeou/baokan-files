Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The life of Greek national hero Glezos, who was unreasonably arrested by the Greek government, is in danger. According to Rossi, a well-known Italian social activist and vice-president of the Women's International Democratic Federation who just returned from Athens, told the Italian newspaper "National Evening News" on the 10th that if the military court tries Glezos, a member of the administrative committee of the Greek United Democratic Left Party and president of the "Dawn Daily," according to the infamous Law No. 375, he will be shot.

The Greek national hero Glezos is a loyal patriot. From the time of the German Nazi occupation of Greece, Glezos waged an unyielding struggle against the German fascist occupiers. On the night of May 30, 1941, he climbed out of a tunnel onto a heavily guarded castle and tore down the Nazi flag. This courageous act quickly spread throughout Greece. After World War II, whether during the British occupation or under the rule of the Greek reactionary government, Glezos consistently and tirelessly fought for Greece's national independence. He was arrested and imprisoned several times for participating in democratic movements and sentenced to death three times. But the enemy's threat of death did not intimidate this loyal and courageous warrior. After the reactionaries were forced to release him from prison under popular protests, Glezos immediately threw himself into the struggle for national independence and democracy. On December 5 of last year, because the Greek authorities feared the strengthening of the people's progressive forces, they arrested him again on fabricated charges of so-called "espionage" and "plotting a coup" and sent him to a military court for trial.

The Greek government's persecution of democratic forces immediately aroused indignation and condemnation from the broad masses of the Greek people and many prominent social figures. People unanimously pointed out that the Greek government's accusation against him was absurd. Former Prime Minister Tsouderos also believed that "not a word in the accusation against Glezos is true." Now the Greek people's protests are surging. Telegrams from various social groups, trade unions, and urban residents protesting the government's persecution are flooding the Greek government. People realize that saving Glezos is the guarantee of saving Greek democracy, freedom, and peace.

People from all over the world have also launched movements to save Glezos. Since Glezos's arrest, many international organizations and mass organizations from countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy have successively issued statements protesting to the Greek government and demanding the release of Glezos. The All-China Journalists Association and the Chinese Writers Association have also protested the persecution by the Greek authorities. It was precisely because of the pressure of public opinion at home and abroad that the Greek authorities had to announce a postponement of Glezos's trial, but the threat from the military court still exists. Currently, the movement to save Glezos is still continuing to unfold around the world and within Greece.

### 必须让格列索斯恢复自由  世界舆论强烈抗议希腊政府对民族英雄的迫害

    必须让格列索斯恢复自由
    世界舆论强烈抗议希腊政府对民族英雄的迫害
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：受到希腊政府无理逮捕的希腊民族英雄格列索斯的生命正处于危险中。据刚从雅典归来的意大利著名社会活动家、国际民主妇女联合会副主席罗西10日向意大利“国家晚报”说，如果军事法庭根据恶名昭彰的第三百七十五号法律审判希腊统一民主左翼党行政委员会委员和“黎明日报”社社长格列索斯，他就会被枪决。
    希腊民族英雄格列索斯是一个忠诚的爱国者。从德国纳粹占领希腊起，格列索斯就同德国法西斯占领者进行了不屈的斗争。1941年5月30日夜晚，他曾从地道爬上警卫森严的城堡撕下纳粹的旗子，这个勇敢的行动迅速就传遍了整个希腊。第二次大战以后，无论是在英国占领期间或者是希腊反动政府统治时期，格列索斯始终坚持不懈为争取希腊的民族独立进行斗争。他曾经几次因参加民主运动被捕入狱，并且三次被判死刑。但是敌人的死亡的威胁并没吓倒这位忠诚而勇敢的战士。当反动派在人民抗议下不得不把他释放出狱之后，格列索斯又立即投入争取民族独立和民主的斗争。去年12月5日，由于希腊当局害怕人民进步力量的增强，又以虚构的所谓“间谍活动”、“策动政变”的罪名逮捕了他，并将他送交军事法庭审判。
    希腊政府这种迫害民主力量的行为，立即引起希腊广大阶层人民和许多著名社会人士的愤慨和谴责。人们一致指出希腊政府对他的控诉是荒谬的。前首相曹达利斯也认为“在对格列索斯的控告中没有一个字是真话。”现在希腊人民的抗议行动正在风起云涌。各种社会团体、工会组织和城市居民反对政府迫害行动的电报像雪片一样送到希腊政府。人们认识到拯救格列索斯就是拯救希腊民主自由和和平的保证。
    各国人民也纷纷展开了拯救格列索斯的运动。从格列索斯被捕以来，许多国际组织和苏、捷、法、意等国家的群众团体先后发表声明向希腊政府提出了抗议，要求释放格列索斯。我国新闻工作者协会和作家协会等也抗议希腊当局的迫害行为。正是由于国内外舆论的压力，希腊当局曾经不得不宣布延迟对格列索斯的审判，但是，军事法庭对他的威胁仍然存在。目前世界各地和希腊国内拯救格列索斯的运动还在继续展开。
