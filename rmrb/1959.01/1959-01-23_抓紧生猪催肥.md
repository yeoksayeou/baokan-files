Grasp Tightly to Spur Hog Fattening

    After overfulfilling the 1958 task of supplying urban non-staple food, the Xincheng People's Commune in Dawu County, Hubei Province, actively organized production to further expand the supply of non-staple food.

    The commune produces more than twenty kinds of non-staple foods, mainly including fat hogs, beef cattle, chickens, ducks, fresh eggs, and vegetables. Last year, the plan to supply the city with 250 fat hogs was fully completed; the plan to supply 70 beef cattle was completed with 87; the plan to supply 2,000 chickens and ducks was completed with 3,700; and the supply plans for other non-staple foods were also overfulfilled.

    Currently, the commune has decided to support the city with all of the more than 250 fat hogs weighing over 100 jin that are currently in stock; actively fatten piglets weighing less than 60 jin for the commune's own consumption. In addition, it has been decided to sell all of the more than 1,000 dan of processed vegetables (such as radishes, Jerusalem artichokes, and cabbage). At present, the commune has transferred some labor and vehicles to form a transportation shock brigade to transport and sell various non-staple foods.

    抓紧生猪催肥
    湖北大悟县新城人民公社，在超额完成1958年城市副食品供应任务后，又积极组织生产，继续扩大副食品供应。
    这个社的副食品生产有二十多种，其中主要的是肥猪、菜牛、鸡、鸭、鲜蛋、蔬菜等。去年计划供应城市的二百五十头肥猪，已全部完成；计划供应菜牛七十头，已完成八十七头；计划供应鸡鸭两千只，已完成三千七百只；其他各种副食品也都超额完成供应计划。
    目前，公社决定将现在存栏的二百五十多头百斤以上肥猪，全部支援城市；对六十斤以下的槽猪进行积极催肥，作为社内自食。另外，又决定将已加工好的蔬菜（如萝卜、洋姜、白菜）一千多担，全部外销。目前公社已抽调一部分劳动力和车辆，组成一支运输突击队，运销各种副食品。
