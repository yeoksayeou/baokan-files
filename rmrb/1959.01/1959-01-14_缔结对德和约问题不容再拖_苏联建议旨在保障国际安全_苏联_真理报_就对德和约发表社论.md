Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on December 12th entitled "In the Interests of International Security" regarding the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

    The editorial stated that in our era, the situation in Central Europe constitutes one of the most important issues generating international tension. In the fourteen years since the end of the war, there has been no peace treaty with Germany, and one of the two German states – the Federal Republic of Germany – has joined the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, and on its territory, the forces that twice incited world wars in our generation are being revived. In West Berlin, occupied by the United States, Britain, and France, a stronghold of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been established, located in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, and it is used as a tool for hostile activities against the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and countries friendly to them.

    The editorial stated that delaying the signing of a peace treaty and delaying the resolution of the Berlin issue cannot guarantee European security and create normal conditions for the peaceful and democratic development of the German people. In order to consolidate peace and security, the Soviet government, proceeding from the current reality, has put the resolution of these mature international issues on the agenda for 1959.

    Currently, the attitudes of the parties concerned on the German question have been fully determined, and it is now necessary to abandon unnecessary arguments and turn to making practical decisions needed for the German situation and the consolidation of European peace. Those who delay the discussion of the treaty issue have for many years put forward the argument of giving priority to so-called free all-German elections, and insisted that the question of restoring German unity should not be resolved by the Germans themselves, but by the four former occupying powers. These people clearly want to make things so that the German people have neither a peace treaty nor a unified country.

    The restoration of German unity will inevitably go through stages of mutual rapprochement between the two German states, overcoming the profound differences that currently hinder their unification. A peace treaty will create a good foundation for the rapprochement of the two German states. There are no real obstacles to concluding such a treaty. Since the West is attempting to avoid resolving this issue, the Soviet government has pointed out more than once that any meeting held by representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to discuss the issue of a unified Germany is impossible. This issue is not within their purview; it is a matter for the Germans themselves.

    The main purpose of the Soviet draft peace treaty is to ensure the peaceful and democratic development of the German people and to consolidate the security of Europe and the world.

    The editorial went on to say that attempts to divide the world into victors and losers are incompatible with the Soviet people, who harbor no feelings of revenge against their former wartime enemies. The draft treaty ensures a fair attitude towards the legitimate interests of the German people; it differs in principle from the Treaty of Versailles, which the Western countries forced on defeated Germany after the First World War. German public opinion is well aware of the significance of a just peace treaty, and both German states are conducting campaigns to strive for the drafting and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic has been striving for many years to realize this urgent task, and this effort is praised by all peace-loving people.

    The editorial emphasized that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the contrary, should bear most of the responsibility for the current situation in Germany, including the fact that Germany still does not have a peace treaty. The ruling group in West Germany has adopted a policy of reviving militarism and closely linking its policies with the military bloc plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. What Bonn is considering all day long is not easing international tensions, but intensifying the Cold War.

    The provocative clamor stirred up in West Berlin and in several other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization regarding the Berlin issue cannot make the public in these countries forget that the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city is of great significance to the cause of peace. If the Western countries continue to stubbornly refuse to negotiate with the Soviet Union in the interests of normalizing the Berlin situation, then this certainly cannot make the Soviet Union abandon the goals that life itself has put forward halfway, and no one can prevent the Soviet Union from abandoning its functions in Berlin and on the transportation lines between Berlin and West Germany, and no one can prevent the Soviet Union from resolving the resulting problems through consultation with the German Democratic Republic.

    The editorial stated that a policy aimed at the happiness of the German people and determined by the security interests of the European peoples has been approved and supported by peace-loving people in all countries. The Soviet Union is ready to discuss the Berlin issue with the countries concerned, if this is considered appropriate. It is also prepared to exchange views with other countries on the content of a peace treaty with Germany before the conference is convened.

    The editorial concluded by saying that there is every reason to believe that the year 1959 that has begun will be recorded in the history of Europe and all mankind as a year of major peace achievements. The question is up to the Western countries.

### 缔结对德和约问题不容再拖  苏联建议旨在保障国际安全  苏联“真理报”就对德和约发表社论

    缔结对德和约问题不容再拖
    苏联建议旨在保障国际安全
    苏联“真理报”就对德和约发表社论
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”12日就对德和约问题发表了题为“为了国际安全的利益”的社论。
    社论说，在我们的时代里，欧洲中部形成的局势构成了产生国际紧张局势的最重要的问题之一。在战争结束后的十四年中，尚没有一项对德和约，而两个德国中的一个——德意志联邦共和国却又加入了侵略性的北大西洋集团，并且在它的领土上，那种曾在我们这代人中两次煽起世界大战的势力正在复活。在美国、英国和法国占领的西柏林，目前建立了北大西洋公约组织的据点，这个据点位于德意志民主共和国的中心，它被用来作为对苏联、德意志民主共和国以及同它们友好的国家进行敌视活动的工具。
    社论说，拖延签定和约，拖延解决柏林问题，是不能保证欧洲安全和为德国人民的和平和民主发展创造正常条件的。苏联政府为了巩固和平和安全，从目前现实情况出发，把这些成熟了的国际问题的解决提到1959年的日程上来。
    目前，在德国问题上，有关方面的态度已经完全确定，现在有必要抛开不必要的争论，转而作出为德国局势和巩固欧洲和平所需要的实际决定。那些拖延讨论和约问题的人，许多年来一直提出优先进行所谓全德自由选举的论调，并且硬说，恢复德国统一的问题不应当由德国人自己来解决，而要由四个前占领国家来解决。这些人显然是想把事情弄得使德国人民既没有和约，又没有统一的国家。
    恢复德国的统一必不可免地要经过两个德国相互接近的道路上的一些阶段，克服目前妨碍他们统一的深刻分歧。和约会为两个德国的接近创造良好的基础。缔结这种条约不存在任何现实的障碍。既然西方企图避开解决这一问题，苏联政府已不止一次地指出，由苏联、美国、英国和法国代表为讨论统一德国问题而举行任何会晤都是不可能的。这个问题不在他们的权限以内，这是德国人自己的事情。
    苏联的和约草案的主要目的是保证德国人民和平民主的发展，巩固欧洲和全世界的安全。
    社论接着说，把世界分为战胜者和失败者的企图是对苏联各族人民格格不入的，他们对自己从前的战争敌人也绝不会有复仇感。拟定的和约草案能保证对德国人民的合法利益采取公正的态度；它同西方国家在第一次世界大战以后，强迫战败国德国接受的凡尔赛条约是有原则性区别的。德国的舆论非常了解公正的和约的意义，两个德国中都在开展运动，争取草拟和缔结对德和约。德意志民主共和国政府，多年来都在竭力设法实现这项迫切任务，这种努力为所有爱好和平的人民所称道。
    社论强调指出，德意志联邦共和国政府恰恰相反，应当对德国现在的局势负大部分责任，其中必须对德国直到现在还没有和约这件事负责。西德的统治集团采取了复活军国主义的方针，并且把自己的政策同北大西洋公约组织的军事集团计划紧密地联系在一起。波恩整天考虑的，不是缓和国际紧张局势，而是加剧冷战。
    在西柏林和在北大西洋公约组织的几个其他国家中，就柏林问题掀起的挑衅性叫嚣，并不能使这些国家的公众忘掉，苏联提出的关于使西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议，对和平事业具有重大的意义。如果西方国家，今后仍然顽固地拒绝为了柏林局势正常化的利益同苏联进行谈判，那么，这当然不能使苏联在半路上放弃生活本身所提出的目的，任何人也不能够阻止苏联放弃自己对柏林以及柏林同西德的交通线上行使的职权，任何人也不能阻止苏联通过同德意志民主共和国的协商来解决由此而产生的问题。
    社论说，目的在于使德国人民幸福、并且由欧洲各国人民的安全利益所决定的政策，受到了各国爱好和平公众的赞同和支持。苏联准备同有关国家讨论柏林问题，如果这被认为是适宜的话。在和会召开以前，还准备同其他国家就对德国和约内容交换意见。
    社论最后说，有一切理由可以相信，已经开始的1959年，将作为有重大和平成就的一年载入欧洲和全人类史册。问题就看西方国家了。
