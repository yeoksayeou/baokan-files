Henan

(Our newspaper, Kaifeng, 30th dispatch) The drums of war are thundering, and the whole people are marching to seize another 3 trillion jin of fertilizer. This major battle has been fully launched in Henan Province.

At present, the professional labor force participating in manure accumulation in Henan Province has reached more than 3.2 million people. Adding cadres, students, workers, peasants, and urban residents who use their spare time to accumulate fertilizer every day, more than 10 million people are engaged in manure accumulation every day. In the seven days from the 21st to the 27th, a total of 497 billion jin of farm manure and 6.4 billion jin of native chemical fertilizer were accumulated.

Now, in various parts of Henan Province, both urban and rural areas, scenes like the water conservancy upsurge in the spring of 1958 have begun to reappear. The agricultural production movement with "fertilizer in command" is in full swing. In the boundless fields, fertilizer piles up like mountains, and everywhere there is a sea of people accumulating fertilizer. A folk song is popular in Xia邑 County: "Fertilizer mountains are piled up everywhere, white clouds roll around the waist, standing on the pile and looking down, the manure accumulation army rolls like waves." This is the most true portrayal of the current manure accumulation movement in Henan Province.

On the 21st, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed at a telephone conference attended by the first secretaries of various regions and cities that the province should accumulate another 3 trillion jin of fertilizer before the spring sowing. In recent days, the Communist Party organizations at all levels have studied and revised labor plans, allocated labor, assigned manure accumulation tasks, and formulated specific plans for manure accumulation and production at all levels.

Various localities have generally adopted the method of combining the organization of professional teams with the mobilization of the whole people to accumulate fertilizer. After adjusting the distribution ratio of labor, Xinyang Prefecture organized more than 24,000 manure accumulation teams, and the number of people participating in professional manure accumulation increased by more than 130,000 compared with the past. Yuanyang County adopted the method of managing wheat fields during the day and accumulating fertilizer by every household at night. Under the inspiring slogan of "making fertilizer mountains taller than Mount Tai," the people of the county accumulated a total of 275.5 million jin of fertilizer and produced 940 million jin of native chemical fertilizer overnight, with lanterns and torches and thousands of vehicles and ten thousands of loads. The vast number of cadres, urban residents, and students have also actively participated in manure accumulation. In recent days, an average of more than 4,000 cadres from provincial-level agencies stationed in Zhengzhou City have participated in manure accumulation every day.

Since the beginning of winter, the province has accumulated more than 5 trillion jin of farm manure, which is nearly eight times that of the same period last year. Now, with the rapid development of this nationwide manure accumulation movement, many regions have revised their agricultural production increase targets.

Jiangsu

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a radio conference on launching the winter manure accumulation and production movement on the evening of the 28th, calling on the people of urban and rural areas throughout the province to act quickly, immediately launch a nationwide manure accumulation and production competition, and set off a vigorous and down-to-earth manure accumulation and production movement to fight a beautiful battle during the Spring Festival. Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his mobilization report that the province requires an average of at least 100 dan of refined fertilizer or more than 1,000 dan of coarse fertilizer per mu of sown area this year.

Liu Shunyuan demanded that this year's manure accumulation work must focus on increasing the accumulation of refined fertilizer. Refined fertilizer and manure should be given equal importance; organic fertilizer should be given priority, and organic and inorganic fertilizers should be given equal importance. It is required that all parts of the province should accumulate a large amount of coarse fertilizer while accumulating refined fertilizer, so that coarse fertilizer and fine fertilizer are given equal importance. In areas where there is less refined fertilizer, more coarse fertilizer should be accumulated to make up for the shortage of fertilizer.

Liu Shunyuan called on the people of the province: "Grasp fertilizer as if grasping grain, and there will be grain if there is fertilizer." "Now compare fertilizer piles, and in the future compare grain piles."

After listening to the broadcast, the vast number of cadres and the masses of the province were full of fighting spirit and plunged into the manure accumulation movement with the momentum of a tiger descending the mountain.

Liaoning

(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 30th dispatch) Liaoning Province has decided to "put fertilizer in command" and launch a two-month nationwide and vigorous manure accumulation and production blitz throughout the province. It has also decided to transfer 25% of the rural labor force to the manure accumulation and production front to fully accumulate and produce fertilizer. It is required that the province's fertilizer application this year should be 1.5 to 2 times more than last year.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee recently convened a provincial fertilizer work conference, urgently calling for a manure accumulation and production blitz with "fertilizer in command" to strive to accumulate enough manure in two months and send it to the fields. At the meeting, Huang Oudong, Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the province, required all localities to closely follow the work of tool reform, make use of all transportation forces and tools, and accumulate and transport at the same time. All cities should also combine the patriotic health movement to mobilize the people of the city to actively accumulate and produce fertilizer. All factories should make full use of waste water, waste gas, and waste smoke to manufacture various native chemical fertilizers to support the countryside.

Shanxi

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th dispatch) Shanxi Province is mobilizing at all levels, deploying at all levels, and gathering a large number of manure accumulation teams to vigorously build the manure accumulation army. The large-scale manure accumulation movement in various localities is gradually moving towards a climax.

In order to ensure a greater leap forward in 1959, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China successively held telephone conferences of the province's agricultural leading departments in late January to make emergency deployments. At the same time, it held a winter manure accumulation radio conference attended by six million people across the province to conduct a nationwide mobilization, calling on the people of the province to quickly set off a greater manure accumulation upsurge and strive to obtain 10 billion dan of good fertilizer. In accordance with this spirit, various localities have generally studied and determined targets and adopted measures. In addition to deploying work to the counties overnight, the Jin Southeast and Jin South Prefectural Committees of the Communist Party of China also dispatched cadres to help the counties quickly carry out manure accumulation work. Jin Southeast Prefecture has launched a million-person fertilizer war.

At present, the members participating in manure accumulation in various localities are becoming more and more extensive, and factories, mines, organs, troops, and schools have all taken action. According to the deployments of various localities, the province has organized a professional manure accumulation army of 1.5 million to 1.8 million people, and mobilized everyone to take action and every household to accumulate fertilizer.

Shaanxi

(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th dispatch) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held a radio conference on the 27th to mobilize the people of the province to immediately launch a manure accumulation and production blitz. The conference required the 18 million people of the province to go all out, everyone to take action, and every household to participate in actively participating in the manure accumulation movement. Five million people, including the heads of the Communist Party Committees at all levels, commune members, and all rural work cadres throughout the province, listened to the radio conference.

The conference required the people of the province to immediately launch a mass-based manure accumulation and topdressing movement. Urban organs, factories, and schools should also invest in this movement. Agricultural scientific research departments should send people to the countryside to conduct technical guidance on manure accumulation and summarize and promote good manure accumulation experiences. The conference required all people's communes to take manure accumulation as the guiding principle, rationally arrange labor, do a good job in agricultural tool reform, wheat field management, and spring plowing preparations.

During the broadcast conference, more than 20 prefectures and counties, including Yulin and Dali, expressed their firm response to the call of the conference.

Sichuan

(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 30th dispatch) Sichuan Province held a blitz manure accumulation and production radio mobilization conference on the evening of the 29th, calling on the people of the province to immediately take action and set off a nationwide manure accumulation and production upsurge. This conference organized more than 6 million people to listen through more than 70,000 loudspeakers of the provincial broadcasting network.

The conference required the people of the province to win victory in this battle, ensure the completion of accumulating and producing 5 trillion jin of fertilizer before the end of April, of which 20%-30% should be fine fertilizer, and complete 30% of the task before the Spring Festival.

The mobilization conference also analyzed various favorable conditions and put forward many methods for accumulating and producing fertilizer. From today, all parts of the province have taken action.

Xinjiang

(Our newspaper, Urumqi, 30th dispatch) An upsurge in spring plowing centered on manure accumulation has taken shape in both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are seizing the work of accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer with the soaring energy of the people's war on steel. They will accumulate another 400 billion jin of fertilizer before the end of April.

Now, from the countryside to the city, the crowds accumulating and transporting fertilizer are endless. In the northern wilderness of Xinjiang, which is frozen for thousands of miles, farmers dig up frozen soil, look for fertilizer sources, and then use manpower and animal power to pull thousands of light sleds to transport mountains of fertilizer to the edge of farmland.

Xinjiang's fertilizer resources are very rich. The region's more than 22 million livestock produce hundreds of billions of jin of fertilizer every year. Field embankment weeds, red willow fertile soil near oases, and peat in grass lakes are everywhere. Natural ammonium sulfate, niter, and phosphate rock for manufacturing chemical fertilizer are also very abundant. The proven phosphate rock is more than 9.7 billion jin. All people's communes in the autonomous region have established more than 4,000 native chemical fertilizer plants and put them into production.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a radio conference to mobilize people of all ethnic groups in the region to work hard for 100 days and accumulate 400 billion jin of fertilizer. Various prefectures, counties, and ethnic autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have sent telegrams to warmly respond.

Beijing

(Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch) A broad manure accumulation movement has unfolded in Beijing. Chen Peng, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on the people of the city to take immediate action at a radio conference attended by more than 2 million people tonight and launch a vigorous manure accumulation and production movement.

The Communist Party Committees of many organs, factories, schools, and troops have successively convened emergency meetings to deploy manure accumulation and production work. The districts have also successively established manure accumulation headquarters to specifically arrange mass manure accumulation activities within their local sections. More than 200 cadres from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee rushed to Fuxingmenwai in the afternoon and divided into more than a dozen groups to go deep into the residential areas to collect garbage fertilizer. Many residents have also begun to combine the Spring Festival cleaning, cleaning their homes and courtyards, and collecting all the dirty soil, waste, and garbage that can be used as fertilizer to support agricultural production.

Sanitation workers responsible for urban environmental sanitation put into the manure accumulation battle this morning. Workers from the sewer team of the Maintenance and Management Department of the Beijing Municipal Engineering Bureau also used 18 capstans to dig out the sludge from the sewers today. After being dug out, it was immediately pulled to the ground by farmers from the Huangtugang People's Commune in Fengtai District with large carts.

In the days before the people in the urban area of Beijing launched the manure accumulation movement, 270,000 people in the suburbs had participated in manure accumulation, and had accumulated and produced more than 46 billion jin of fertilizer. In addition, more than 360 million jin of various native chemical fertilizers were produced. (Picture attached)

    河南
    本报开封30日电　战鼓雷动，全民出征，再夺肥料三万亿斤的大战役，已在河南省全面开展。
    现在，河南省参加积肥的专业劳动力已达三百二十多万人，全省加上每天利用业余时间积肥的干部、学生、工人、农民及城市市民等，每日投入积肥的有一千多万人。在由21日到27日的七天里，即共积农家肥料四千九百七十亿斤，制土化肥六十四亿斤。
    现在，在河南省各地，不论城市和乡村，又开始出现了像1958年春季水利高潮时一样的场面，以“肥料挂帅”的农业生产运动在轰轰烈烈地进行着，无边的田野里，肥料堆积如山，处处都是人山人海的积肥大军。夏邑县流行着一首民歌：“处处堆起肥料山，白云滚滚绕腰间，站在堆上往下看，积肥人马如浪翻”，这就是对河南省当前积肥运动最真实的写照。
    21日，中共河南省委在有各地、市委第一书记参加的电话会议上，提出全省要在春播以前再积肥三万亿斤。连日来，各级中共党组织都逐级研究与修订了劳动规划，调配了劳动力，分配了积肥任务，并层层制定了积肥和造肥的具体计划。
    各地普遍采取了组织专业队和发动全民积肥相结合的方法。信阳专区调整了劳动力的分配比例之后，全区共组织积肥队二万四千多个，参加专业积肥的人数比过去增加了十三万多人。原阳县采用白天搞麦田管理，夜晚家家户户搞积肥，全县人民在“要使肥山比泰山”的豪迈口号鼓舞下，一夜之间，灯笼火把，千车万担，共积肥二亿七千五百多万斤，制成土化肥九亿四千万多斤。广大干部和城市市民及学生等，也都积极参加积肥。驻在郑州市的省级机关连日来平均每天都有四千多干部参加积肥。
    入冬以来，全省共积农家肥料五万多亿斤，等于去年同期将近八倍。现在，随着这次全民积肥运动的迅速开展，许多地区都纷纷修订农业增产指标。
