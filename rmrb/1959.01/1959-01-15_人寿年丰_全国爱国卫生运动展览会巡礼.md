    Abundant Life and Bumper Harvests
    ——A Tour of the National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition
    By our reporter Wei Wenhua
    The National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition, currently being held at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace and Zhongshan Park, displays thousands of exhibits selected from twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, including objects, specimens, models, photos, descriptions... Here, people first see the Party's deep concern for the health of the people. There are photos of the great leader Chairman Mao inspecting urban and rural areas in Zhejiang and Sichuan, Chairman Mao's talks and inscriptions, central documents on launching the Patriotic Health Campaign, and photos of leading comrades of Party organizations at all levels, from provinces and cities to grassroots, formulating health campaign plans, mobilizing the masses, inspecting the sites, and participating in labor with the masses. From top to bottom, the whole Party and the entire people are of one heart and one mind, forming a mass movement, achieving one victory after another.
          A Widespread Dragnet
    Sparrows and rats have harmed mankind for many years. But now, many places have laid down a widespread dragnet, leaving these "flying bandits" and "earthly bandits" with no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth.
    The exhibition displays the experiences of the masses in various places in catching sparrows using methods such as hitting, trapping, digging, poisoning, and "bombing," as well as the deeds of sparrow-killing experts. One set of exhibits from Henan Province introduces Song Tianpu, a 62-year-old sharpshooter from Runan County. This hunter has mastered the habits of sparrows and knows six kinds of shooting techniques. He once went on expeditions to five counties, including Shangcai and Sui, and killed more than 91,000 sparrows in ten months in 1958. In the exhibits from Yunnan and Guizhou, there are stories of Li Defa and Tang Erjiu, sparrow-catching experts who can understand bird language. A wire recorder even plays the sound of Tang Erjiu imitating four kinds of bird calls. According to the explanation, Tang Erjiu used "decoy sparrows" and other tools to catch sparrows, catching more than 100,000 from January to September 1958. One morning, he caught more than 500 in just two hours.
    In 1958, various places promoted a mass "bombing" and encirclement campaign to eliminate sparrows on a large scale. This method was based on scientific research, grasping the weakness of sparrows' low endurance to flight. On a regular basis, the masses are mobilized simultaneously in a wide area, from cities to villages, with gongs and drums sounding everywhere, launching a full-scale attack, leaving these flying bandits with no place to land, and falling to the ground exhausted and dying after flying for several hours. The exhibition displays many scenes of sparrow encirclement and photos of piles of dead sparrows. One set of exhibits from Shandong Province, entitled "A Widespread Dragnet, Making it Difficult for Sparrows to Escape with Wings," shows from the photos that the masses are comprehensively bombing, catching, hitting, digging, and blocking sparrows on ships, on land, on houses, in fields, and in forests. Incomplete statistics for the province show that in several battles in 1958, more than 66 million sparrows were eliminated.
    The cunning rats could not escape the pursuit of the masses either. The exhibition introduced the rich rat extermination experiences created by the masses in various places, and displayed a large number of rat-catching tools, truly ingenious, each showing its own skills. The masses in Anhui Province created more than 170 kinds of rat-catching tools, of which 80 are exhibited here, generally divided into nine categories: closing, pressing, clamping, clipping, cutting, drilling, fastening, turning over, and tightening, such as "tiger's mouth" and "maze." Some tools are designed to make rats want to enter, and once they enter, they are finished. Under the neon light title of "Chongqing Rat Extermination Battle," with pictures, on-site models, specimens, and descriptions, the rat extermination work in this mountain city, known for its many and large rats, is systematically introduced. The city eliminated more than 5.9 million rats in several battles, greatly reducing the rat infestation. Another set of exhibits introduces the situation in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, in eliminating the susliks that transmit plague. From April to August 1958, more than 310,000 people participated in the work, organizing more than 600 brigades, 1,200 companies, and 5,600 squads, launching three major campaigns, using shovels to dig and water to irrigate, eliminating tens of thousands of susliks. In the autumn, an inspection of more than 4,300 hectares of land showed an average of only 0.024 suslik holes per hectare.
    In 1958, various places eliminated hundreds of millions of sparrows and rats. The experiences introduced in various places prove that as long as everyone takes action and perseveres, these pests can be completely eliminated!
          Combining Symptomatic and Fundamental Treatment
    A considerable part of the exhibition introduces the mass mobilization to eliminate flies and mosquitoes, with tools for catching and killing flies and mosquitoes, and scenes of the "smoke sea battle" of using medicine to fumigate and kill mosquitoes. From hitting one by one to eliminating them in batches, various pictures and models show the wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of the masses.
    In addition to these symptomatic treatments, many places have also filled in pits and depressions, dredged ditches, and strengthened the management of toilets to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and flies, greatly improving environmental hygiene. The exhibition displays many vivid examples of this: The model of the comparison before and after the transformation of the Liaozi River in Shashi, Hubei Province, exhibited by Hubei Province, shows on one side that the place used to be a place for the burial of abandoned infants: more than a dozen patches of dirty black mud ponds, and several dilapidated thatched huts; on the other side, it is the situation after the masses renovated it with the support of the government: green ponds with lotus flowers, neat roadsides with trees and orchards, and bright and tidy houses, like a garden. Local folk songs mention that in the past, "three feet of black mud was over the cow's legs, and withered lotuses were everywhere breeding mosquitoes," but now, "the roads are broad and the flowers are full of trees, the river is clear and many fish swim." A set of exhibits from Zhejiang Province introduces that under the leadership of the Party, the people of Ningbo City adopted the method of "combining symptomatic and fundamental treatment, combining native and foreign methods," and in the early days of 1958, fought for 45 days to fill in more than 30 sewage ditches in the urban area, and transformed more than 90 miles of leaky roads and underground ditches into double-layered stone slab dark ditches, relatively thoroughly improving more than 12,000 manure tanks and toilets throughout the city, and strengthening the management of more than 90,000 open-air water tanks, eliminating and controlling a large number of mosquito and fly breeding grounds.
    The patriotic health campaign of eliminating the four pests has also prompted some places to begin to change their customs and habits. Paying attention to hygiene has become a habit, and many farmers are accustomed to brushing their teeth and washing their faces with their own towels. The exhibits from Qinghai introduce that some Tibetan women have begun to use menstrual belts.
    After the realization of the people's communes in the countryside, it created more favorable conditions for further improving environmental sanitation. The exhibits from Heilongjiang and Shaanxi provinces introduce that some places have merged and rebuilt toilets, and built livestock pens in the fields and mountain gullies. Hunan and other provinces introduced the experience of strengthening the management of feces and using biogas. In some places in the Northwest, cow dung used to be smeared on the walls and dried as fuel, but now it is no longer used like this. From the photos, it can be seen that these walls have been plastered, and some have even been painted with murals.
          Sending Away the God of Plague
    While the arrows on the statistical charts of China's construction projects are all rising, only in this exhibition can some downward-pointing arrows be seen, that is, the percentages of the incidence of various infectious diseases, such as dysentery, malaria, relapsing fever, pertussis, typhus, measles, etc., are decreasing year by year, and some diseases have approached zero in some areas. The exhibition gives a strong impression that various places have achieved remarkable results in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and implementing various comprehensive measures to prevent and control diseases. Cholera, which has been prevalent in China for more than 100 years, has now been eradicated; the plague that was prevalent in many areas before liberation was quickly brought under control after liberation, and human plague had been basically eliminated by 1956. Smallpox, which occurred year after year before liberation, was also basically eliminated in 1954.
    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country further launched a struggle against diseases that endanger people's health. Look at the several sets of products from Fujian Province! Under the title of "Thousands of Troops and Horses Destroying Snails," people blasted and destroyed snails on the islands, and climbed cliffs in remote mountain valleys to track down snails. From March to June, the relevant counties throughout the province mobilized more than 1.3 million people to destroy snails in an area of more than 28 million square meters, more than 17 times the total area of snail destruction in the past six years. In some places, after 15 re-examinations, it is not easy to find snails. The Liu Jintao Pioneer Group exhibited by Hunan Province used to treat 30 people a month with old methods in the work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis. In April 1958, they changed to using new methods to treat 6,000 people a month. In malaria-prone areas, especially in Yunnan, Guizhou and other places, the masses vigorously eliminated mosquitoes, greatly reducing the incidence rate. For example, a set of exhibits from Simao County, Yunnan Province, introduces that more than 30 years ago, there were more than 300,000 people here. Since malaria began to prevail in 1918, the county has only had more than 20,000 people due to continuous population deaths and migrations before liberation. After several years of patriotic health campaign and a large number of mosquitoes eliminated, the incidence of malaria in the county in 1958 was only 0.04%. The exhibition shows photos of the changes in Zhushi Street in the city. Before liberation, the streets were overgrown with weeds, but now they are bustling commercial districts with many shops. Guizhou Province's folk songs contrast the past and the present: in the past, "the rice is yellow in August, the malaria (malaria) demon gets into bed, nine out of ten people are sick, and no one sends medicine," but now, "the rice is yellow in August, the shadoofs are ringing in the fields, people come from all directions to carry rice, and people are happy everywhere."
    A large amount of material displayed in the exhibition shows that combining hygiene, accumulating fertilizer, and dredging ditches is conducive to farmland water conservancy; eliminating the four pests and eliminating hundreds of millions of rats and sparrows can save a lot of food; and the reduction of diseases also increases the attendance rate. The exhibits introduce that the masses in some places describe this situation as: people increase their life expectancy, fields increase grain, new countryside, new atmosphere!

    人寿年丰
    ——全国爱国卫生运动展览会巡礼
    本报记者  魏文华
    正在首都劳动人民文化宫和中山公园举行的全国爱国卫生运动展览会，陈列着从全国二十七个省、市、自治区选送来的几千件展品，有实物、标本、模型、照片、说明……。在这里人们首先看到：党对人民健康的深切关怀，这里有伟大领袖毛主席到浙江、四川城乡视察时的照片，主席的谈话和题词，中央关于开展爱国卫生运动的文献，各省、市、自治区以至基层党组织负责同志制定卫生运动规划，发动群众，到现场检查，和群众一起参加劳动的照片。全国各地从上到下，全党全民一条心，形成一个群众性的运动，取得了一个胜利又一个胜利。
          遍布天罗地网
    麻雀和老鼠，多少年来为害人类。但现在，许多地方布下了天罗地网，使这些“飞贼”、“土寇”，上天无路，入地无门。
    这里展出了各地群众利用打、捕、掏、毒、轰等办法捕雀的经验和打雀能手的事迹。河南省有一组展品介绍汝南县的神枪手宋天普，这个六十二岁的猎人，掌握了雀性，会用六种枪法，曾远征上蔡、遂平等五个县，在1958年十个月中打雀九万一千多只。在云南、贵州的展品中，有会鸟语的捕雀能手李德发、唐二九的事迹，钢丝录音机还放出唐二九学四种鸟叫的声音。据说明员介绍，唐二九利用
  “迷雀”和其它工具捕雀，在1958年1月到9月即捕到十万多只，有一个早上只两小时就捕到五百多只。
    各地在1958年推行了一种群众性的
  “轰”击围歼战，大规模地消灭麻雀。这种办法是根据科学研究，抓住麻雀耐飞力小的弱点，在广大地区范围内定期发动全民，同时统一行动，从城市到农村，到处锣鼓齐鸣，全线出击，使这些飞贼没有落脚之地，连飞几个钟头后疲累坠地而死。这里展出许多围歼麻雀的场面、成堆死雀的照片。山东省一组题名为“遍布天罗地网，叫麻雀有翅难逃”的展品，从照片上可以看到群众在船上、陆地上、房屋上、田野、树林中，对麻雀全面地轰、捕、打、掏、堵，全省不完全统计，在1958年的几个战役，即消灭麻雀六千六百多万只。
    狡猾的老鼠，也逃不脱群众的追击。展览会介绍了各地群众创造的丰富的灭鼠经验，展出大批捕鼠工具，真是千奇百异，各显神通。安徽省群众创造了一百七十多种捕鼠工具，这里展出的就有八十种，总起来有关、压、卡、夹、铡、锥、扣、翻、勒等九大类，什么老虎嘴、迷魂阵……，有些工具设计得使老鼠见了就想进去，进去就完蛋。在霓虹灯的“重庆灭鼠战”的大字标题下，用图画、现场模型、标本和说明，系统地介绍这个以鼠多鼠大闻名的山城的灭鼠工作。全市几次战役灭鼠五百九十多万只，大大地减轻了鼠患。另外有一组展品，介绍吉林省扶余县消灭传染鼠疫的黄鼠的情形，在1958年4月到8月全县有三十一万多人次出动，组织六百多个大队、一千二百多个中队和五千六百多个小队，发动三次大战役，用锹挖、水灌，消灭了成万的黄鼠，秋季在四千三百多公顷土地上检查，平均每公顷只有零点零二四个鼠洞。
    1958年，各地消灭了上亿的麻雀、老鼠。各地介绍的经验证明，只要大家动手，再接再厉，这些害物是可以消灭干净的！
          治标治本兼施
    展览会上有相当一部分展品，介绍全民动手消灭苍蝇、蚊子，有捕杀蝇、蚊的工具，有用药物熏杀蚊子的“烟海大战”的情景，从一个一个地打，到成批地灭，各种各样的画面和模型，显示出群众的智慧和冲天干劲。
    除了这些治标的办法，在许多地方还填坑垫洼，疏通水沟，加强对厕所的管理等，不让蚊蝇孳生，大大改善了环境卫生。展览会展出了许多这样生动的事例：湖北省展出的沙市廖子河前后对比的模型，一边标示出过去这里原是乱葬弃婴的场所：十几片污黑的泥塘，几间破败的茅屋；另一边是群众在政府支持下加以整治后的情形：碧绿的池水中有荷花，齐整的路边是树木和果园，住宅窗明屋整，像个花园。当地的歌谣提到过去是“三尺黑泥没牛腿，残荷遍地孳蚊窝”，现在是“道路康庄花满树，河水清彻游鱼多”。浙江省的一组展品，介绍宁波市人民在党的领导下，采取“标本兼治，土洋结合”的办法，在1958年初奋战四十五天，填塞市区内三十多条污水沟渠，把全市计长九十多里的漏缝马路和阴沟改建成双层石板暗沟，比较彻底地改善了全市一万二千多口粪缸和厕所，加强了对九万多口露天水缸的管理，消灭和控制了大量蚊蝇孳生地。
    除四害讲卫生运动，促使有些地方的风俗习惯也在开始发生变化。讲卫生已经成为习惯，许多地方农民习惯了刷牙和用自己的毛巾洗脸。青海的展品中，介绍藏族妇女有的开始使用月经带。
    在农村实现人民公社化以后，为进一步改善环境卫生创造了更为有利的条件。在黑龙江、陕西等省展品中，介绍有些地方合并改建厕所，在田头、山沟修建牲畜圈窝。湖南等省介绍了加强对粪便管理、进行沼气利用的经验。西北地区有些地方过去把牛粪抹在墙上，晒干作燃料，现在不用这样作了，从照片上可以看到，这些墙已经粉刷，有的还画上了壁画。
          送瘟神
    我国各项建设事业统计图表的箭头都是向上升的时候，独独在这个展览会看到一些下垂的箭头，那就是统计各种传染性疾病，如痢疾、疟疾、回归热、百日咳、斑疹伤寒、麻疹等发病率的百分比逐年下降，有些病在有些地区已经接近零。展览会给人一个强烈的印象，各地除四害，讲卫生，推行各种防治疾病的综合措施，已有显著成效。在我国流行了一百多年的霍乱，现已根绝；解放前在许多地区流行的鼠疫，解放后迅速得到控制，到1956年即已基本消灭了人间鼠疫。解放前连年不断的天花，也在1954年基本消灭。
    1958年大跃进中，全国各地人民在党的领导下，向危害人民健康的疾病进一步开展斗争。看福建省的几组产品！在“千军万马灭钉螺”的标题下，人们在海岛上爆破灭螺，到人迹罕到的深山野谷，攀登悬岩峭壁去追查钉螺，全省有关各县从3月到6月先后发动一百三十多万人次，灭螺面积达二千八百多万平方公尺，超过过去六年灭螺面积总和的十七倍多，在一些地方经十五次复查，已不容易找到钉螺了。湖南省展出的刘锦桃先锋小组，在防治血吸虫病工作中，过去用老办法一个月治三十人，1958年4月改用新办法一个月治疗六千人。在疟疾流行的地区，特别是云南、贵州等地，群众大力消灭蚊子，使发病率大大降低。如云南省的思茅县的一组展品介绍说，三十多年前这里原有三十多万人口，自从1918年开始流行疟疾，连年人口死亡和迁移，到解放前夕全县只有二万多人。经过几年来爱国卫生运动，大量消灭蚊子，1958年全县疟疾发病率只有0.04％。展览会展出了城内珠市街的变化的照片，解放前街头是荒草丛生，现在已经是商店林立的闹市区了。贵州省的民谣把过去和现在作了对比：过去是“八月谷子黄，摆子（疟疾）鬼上床，十有九人病，无人送药汤”，现在是“八月谷子黄，满田戽斗响，四面八方来挑谷，人群到处喜洋洋”。
    展览会展出的大量材料显示出：结合讲卫生，积肥料，疏通沟渠，有利于农田水利；除四害消灭了上亿的鼠、雀，可以节约大笔粮食；疾病减少，出勤率也在提高。展品介绍有些地方的群众形容这种情景是：人增寿，田增粮，新农村，新气象！
