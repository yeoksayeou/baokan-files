Transforming Imposing Mountains into Thoroughfares
Miao Manshan, First Secretary of the Jiangzhang County Party Committee, Sichuan Province

Jiangzhang County is one of the iron and steel bases under construction in Sichuan Province. The county has now built fifty-three small blast furnace clusters. Within the county, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway runs north-south, the Mianjiang Highway, the Zhongyan Highway, and the year-round navigable Fujiang River crisscross, and there are plans to develop and utilize the Rangshui River, for a total of over 300 kilometers of land and water transportation lines. It seems that transportation conditions are not too bad. However, most of the mining areas and furnace clusters are located in high mountains, and short-distance connection transport is a "difficult hurdle," a "narrow road" in iron and steel production.

Our county's mines are distributed among eleven mountains, including Guanzwu Mountain, Yunle Mountain, Taihua Mountain, and Lao Jun Mountain, all over 2,000 meters above sea level. Most of the mining areas are sparsely populated, the areas are vast, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and the roads are rugged. Some areas are entirely precipitous cliffs with no roads at all. The narrow paths were trodden out by the feet of the iron and steel army after they went up the mountain. Generally, from the furnace clusters to the mines, there are more than 20 *li*, and some mining areas are more than 50 *li* away. Especially during the continuous autumn rains, the roads are muddy, and round-trip transportation is very difficult. In the Penzi Mountain mining area, there is a famous Yama Slope and Monkey Cliff. Even climbing up empty-handed requires climbing like a monkey. The laborers from Luojiang County said: "What a Yama Pass, even monkeys find it hard to climb; what a Monkey Cliff, the road hangs in the air; tired and sweaty, the furnace is still hungry." The laborers on Guanzwu Mountain described Guanzwu Mountain as follows: "Guanzwu Mountain, shrouded in mist, it's clear less than two days out of three; the peaks are high and the roads are uneven, it's difficult to travel in the rain, walking with a cane, it's difficult to transport ore." It is clear that the transportation conditions in the mining area are very bad.

However, in order to guarantee the production of local blast furnaces, each work area has had to invest a large amount of labor in transporting ore and fuel. In most areas, transportation accounts for 50%-60% of the entire iron and steel army. The Guanzwu Mountain mining area has a total of 31,100 laborers, of which 20,479 are engaged in transportation, accounting for 66% of the total labor force. Due to poor transportation conditions, too much labor is spent on transportation, greatly increasing the cost of local iron. If this continues, not only will the cost of iron not be reduced, but it will also affect the completion of other transportation tasks. The supply of staple and non-staple foods and infrastructure materials needed by the mining area often became unbalanced last year. At the same time, the roads are narrow, and thousands of transportation troops are crowded on the rugged and winding roads. There is not enough space on the road, the work efficiency is low, and production is often stopped due to lack of materials. Once, during a high-yield week, it rained and the Guanzwu Mountain mining area could not go up the mountain to transport ore. The mining area mobilized more than 5,000 people to line up from the top of the mountain to the bottom, passing the ore by hand in turn. After passing through thousands of hands, the ore was polished and the workers' hands were also worn sore, but the average daily transportation volume per person was less than 50 *jin*. As a result, it was necessary to stop the furnace and wait for materials.

In order to break through this difficult hurdle, we, following the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee, with the strong assistance of the transportation departments of the province and the special district, launched a mass technical revolution in December last year to realize the "one network and four modernizations" movement of furnace clusters and mining areas.

The Provincial Party Committee instructed that the "small native groups" principle should be implemented when carrying out "one network and four modernizations." However, some cadres did not have a clear understanding of this principle at the time. Some people advocated building highways and buying cars; to build cableways and chutes, we need steel wire ropes and electric equipment, and so on. Some people said that native methods simply would not work. Some people believed that the mountains were high and the roads were dangerous, and the project was huge, so it would be difficult to complete such an arduous task in a short time, and they advocated maintaining the status quo and living one day at a time. Many comrades also believed that the labor force was tight, and drawing more people to engage in "one network and four modernizations" would seriously affect production, and they advocated doing it after the labor force was slightly relaxed. In short, they lacked the confidence and courage to conquer nature, and held a negative and fearful attitude towards realizing "one network and four modernizations."

The County Party Committee promptly criticized these ideas. We, in the spirit of doing small things if big things cannot be done, doing native things if foreign things are not available, and finding technical solutions from the masses, mobilized the masses to use bamboo ropes instead of steel wire ropes, wooden rails instead of steel rails, wooden wheels instead of iron wheels, cable cars without power, and native explosives without yellow explosives, overcoming a series of difficulties in carrying out "one network and four modernizations."

In November of last year, we first conducted a pilot project of "one network and four modernizations" in the Guanzwu Mountain mining area, determined to educate cadres with living facts and set an example to drive the overall situation. On technical issues, the Guanzwu Mountain mining area adopted the method of concentrating "five craftsmen" and "four soldiers" (the five craftsmen are mud workers, blacksmiths, carpenters, stonemasons, and bricklayers; the four soldiers are demobilized engineers, artillerymen, tank soldiers, and transportation soldiers), forming a technical team of more than 500 people; and adopted the method of masters teaching apprentices and experienced workers leading new workers to learn and do at the same time, solving the problem of insufficient technical strength. In terms of raw materials, we started by mobilizing the masses to donate materials, and cut down bamboo and wood on the mountain to solve the materials needed for large-scale "one network and four modernizations." The wooden rails, chutes, cableways, chicken carts, native trains, etc. we used were all made by the masses.

Regarding the arrangement of labor, in the pilot project, we first strengthened the political education of the laborers, conscientiously implemented quota management, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses, reducing 10%-15% of idleness and waste. At the same time, we promoted the experience of large-scale blasting in mining, which greatly improved work efficiency. After taking these measures, the entire mining area withdrew more than 3,000 laborers, and the labor problem was solved. As a result, not only did it not affect the completion of the production task, but it also promoted mining work, and the mining volume per person per day increased from 770 *jin* to 2,700 *jin*. The number of people decreased by 3,000, but the daily ore output increased by 2,279 tons compared to before. We formed the more than 3,000 people who were withdrawn into a road-building and vehicle-making team and immediately put them into the battle of "one network and four modernizations," building two native railway tracks, 2,600 meters long; two chutes, 420 meters long; two rack railway tracks, 700 meters long; thirteen cableways, 2,618 meters long; and repaired a 12-*li* long highway. We also built 98 new native railway cars, 891 chicken carts, and 20 flatbed carts. This greatly changed the transportation landscape of the Guanzwu Mountain mining area.

After the mining area transportation network was built, the transportation efficiency increased by 18.6 times compared to the original. The number of people engaged in transportation decreased from the original 20,479 to 2,207. Calculated solely on the wage expenditure of the reduced labor force, the cost per ton of iron was reduced by 873 yuan compared to before. The realization of "one network and four modernizations" reduced the phenomenon of carrying by shoulder in the mining area, and also greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers.

The living facts educated the cadres and pointed out a correct path for all work areas in the county to realize "one network and four modernizations." Then we held an on-site meeting in the Guanzwu Mountain mining area, and a magnificent mass movement quickly unfolded throughout the county. Each work area acted while planning, and in accordance with the principle of "adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and focusing on native methods," chutes were set up in high mountains, cableways were erected in the air, highways were built on gentle slopes, and tracks were laid on flat ground. All cadres and laborers were divided into two teams, one focusing on production and the other on transportation, drumming up two sets of drums at the same time, and setting off two high tides of production and "four modernizations."

All iron and steel warriors, with soaring enthusiasm and a determination to conquer nature, after a month of hard work, 32 furnace clusters in six work areas of the county's nine work areas basically realized "one network and four modernizations." By the end of December, a total of 25 simple highways, 290 kilometers long; 24 rack railway tracks, 122 kilometers long; 54 pedestrian paths, 165 kilometers long; 113 chutes, 20 kilometers long; 96 pairs of cableways, 9.55 kilometers long; and 17 wooden railway tracks, 18 kilometers long, were built. More than 800 wooden railcar boxes and 4,060 various native carts were manufactured, which greatly changed the transportation landscape of the mining area and furnace clusters, liberated the labor force, and reduced production costs. Because the principle of "small native groups" was implemented, the entire project cost very little investment. A project as large as Guanzwu Mountain only used more than 300 yuan. In October, the county had more than 80,000 laborers engaged in transporting coal and ore. After the realization of "one network and four modernizations," the number has decreased to 37,633, a reduction of 53%. The daily transportation volume has increased from 1,500 tons in October to about 8,000 tons, basically solving the problem of tight transportation capacity.

After the realization of "one network and four modernizations," everyone's mood was higher and their enthusiasm was greater, and there was a happy atmosphere everywhere. The masses in the Chonghua work area praised: "The chutes are like flowing water, the wooden rails open the way, the cableways are erected in the air, and the ore comes from the sky." They also said: "More people, more ideas, the carts climb the slopes; the ore is transported in the air, and the carrying pole is gone." It can be seen that as long as we resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and vigorously carry out technical revolutions, it is entirely possible to change the transportation landscape of mountain furnace clusters and mining areas in a short period of time, increase labor productivity, greatly reduce the labor force, and reduce production costs.

Although we have made some achievements in the "one network and four modernizations" work, our work is still not done well enough. There are still three mining areas in Jiangzhang County that have not fully realized "one network and four modernizations." Even in the better-performing mining areas, we still need to continue to vigorously carry out technical revolutions. In particular, there is still much work to be done in the mechanization of mining and iron smelting. We plan to manufacture a large number of ore crushers, coal crushers, ore dressing machines, charging machines, native cranes, etc. in the future; change the hand-operated bellows of native blast furnaces to animal or water power, and increase the air volume; accelerate the construction of hot blast furnaces; and gradually transform the "small native groups" into "small foreign groups," so that the mining area furnace clusters will embark on the road of mechanization and semi-mechanization, thereby fundamentally solving the problems of tight labor force and high product costs, and strive for a greater leap forward in iron and steel production this year.

    崇山峻岭变通途
    中共四川省江彰县委第一书记　苗满山
    江彰县是四川省正在建设中的钢铁基地之一。全县现在已经建成了五十三个小高炉群。在县境里，交通干线有宝成铁路纵贯南北，绵江公路、中雁公路、常年通航的涪江交错其间，并准备开辟让水河加以利用，总计水陆交通干线共长三百多公里，看来交通条件并不太差。但是矿区炉群绝大部分在高山上，短途接运却是一个“难关”，是钢铁生产中的“窄路”。
    我县的矿山分布在观雾山、云乐山、太华山、老君山等十一座都在两千公尺以上的高山中，大部分矿区人烟稀少，地区辽阔，山高坡陡，道路崎岖。有一些地区完全是悬岩陡壁，根本无路可走，羊肠小道还是钢铁大军上山后用脚踏出来的。一般矿区，从炉群到矿山，有二十多华里，部分矿区在五十里以上。特别在秋雨连绵季节，道路泥泞，往返运输十分困难。盆子山矿区有个著名的阎王坡和猴儿岩，空手上山也要像猴子一样攀着东西爬行。罗江县的民工说：“好个阎王关，猴子也难攀；好个猴儿岩，路在空中悬；累的满身汗，炉子还饿饭。”观雾山的民工形容观雾山说：“观雾山，雾沉沉，三天没有两天晴；峰高路不平，雨天难通行，走路拄拐棍，难把矿石运”。由此可见，矿区交通条件是很坏的。
    但是，为了保证土高炉的生产，各工区不得不投入大批的劳动力运输矿石和燃料。多数地区运输力量占全部钢铁大军的50％—60％。观雾山矿区共有劳动力三万一千一百人，搞运输的即达二万零四百七十九人，占了劳动力总数的66％。由于交通条件不好，在运输上花费的劳动力太多，大大增高了土铁成本。这样下去，不仅铁的成本无法降低，也影响到其他运输任务的完成。矿区所需要的主副食品和基建材料的供应，去年就常常产生失调现象。同时，道路狭窄，成千上万的运输大军拥挤在崎岖曲折的道路上，路上摆不开，工效又低，生产方面经常停炉待料。有一次在高产周中，适逢雨天，观雾山矿区无法上山运矿石。矿区动员了五千多人从山上一直排到山下，依次用手传递，一块矿石经过几千双手，矿石都磨光了，工人的手也磨痛了，而每人每天的运量平均不到五十斤，结果不得不停炉待料。
    为了突破这个难关，我们按照省委和地委的指示，在省和专区交通部门大力协助下，去年12月份开展了一次大搞技术革命，实现炉群、矿区的“一网四化”运动。
    省委指示搞“一网四化”应该贯彻“小土群”的方针。但是当时有些干部对这个方针认识不清。有的人主张要修就修公路、买汽车；要搞索道、梭槽，就要有钢丝绳和电动设备等等。有的人说，土办法根本不行。有些人认为，山高路险，工程浩大，恐怕短时间内很难完成这样艰巨的任务，主张保持现状，能维持一天算一天。还有不少同志认为劳动力紧张，要再抽人搞“一网四化”，会严重地影响生产，主张在劳动力稍有缓和之后再搞。总之，他们缺乏征服自然的信心和勇气，对实现“一网四化”抱着一种消极畏难的情绪。
    县委及时批判了这些思想。我们本着大的不行搞小的，没有洋的搞土的，技术问题找群众的精神，动员群众用篦绳代钢丝绳，木轨代钢轨，木轮代铁轮，没有动力用缆车，没有黄色炸药用土炸药，克服了大搞“一网四化”中一系列的困难。
    去年11月份，我们首先在观雾山矿区进行了“一网四化”的试点，决心以活的事实教育干部，做出样子带动全面。在技术问题上，观雾山矿区采用了集中
  “五匠”、“四兵”的办法（五匠是泥水匠、铁匠、木匠、石匠、砖瓦匠；四兵即复员的工兵、炮兵、坦克兵、交通兵），组成了一支五百多人的技术队伍；并采用师傅带徒弟，老手带新手的办法边学边做，解决了技术力量不足的问题。原材料方面，一开始就发动群众献料，并在山上就地砍伐竹材和木材，解决了大搞“一网四化”所需要的材料。我们所用的木轨道、梭槽、索道、鸡公车、土火车等全部是群众配制的。
    对于劳动力的安排，在试点中我们首先加强民工政治教育，认真贯彻定额管理，充分发挥群众的积极性，减少了10％—15％的窝工浪费。同时在采矿方面推广了大量爆破的经验，大大地提高了工效。采取这些措施后，全矿区共抽出劳动力三千多人，劳动力问题解决了。这样做的结果，不但没有影响到生产任务的完成，还推动了采矿工作，每人每天的采矿量由七百七十斤提高到了二千七百斤，人数减少了三千，每天矿石产量却比以前增加了二千二百七十九吨。我们将抽出来的三千多人，组成一支筑路造车队伍，立即投入“一网四化”的战斗，修成了土火车道两条，长二千六百公尺；梭槽二道，长四百二十公尺；架车道二条，长七百公尺；索道十三条，长二千六百一十八公尺；并补修了长十二华里的公路一条。新造土火车九十八辆，鸡公车八百九十一辆，板车二十架。这样就大大地改变了观雾山矿区的交通运输面貌。
    矿区运输网建成后，运输效率比原来提高了十八点六倍。搞运输的人员由原来的二万零四百七十九人，减少到二千二百零七人。单以减少下来的劳动力的工资开支计算，每吨铁的成本就比以前减少八百七十三元。实现了“一网四化”，矿区减少了肩挑人背现象，也大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    活生生的事实教育了干部，给全县各工区实现“一网四化”指出了一条正确的道路。接着我们在观雾山矿区召开了现场会议，全县范围内就迅速掀起了规模壮阔的群众运动。各工区边规划边行动，按照
  “因地制宜、就地取材、以土办法为主”的原则，高山设梭槽，空中架索道，缓坡修公路，平地铺轨道，将所有干部和劳动力分为两套班子，一手抓生产，一手抓交通运输，两套锣鼓一齐打，掀起了生产、“四化”两个高潮。
    全体钢铁战士以冲天的干劲，抱着坚决征服自然的决心，经过一个月的苦战，全县九个工区的五十三个炉群中，有六个工区的三十二个炉群基本上实现了
  “一网四化”。到12月底，总计修了简易公路二十五条，长二百九十公里；架车道二十四条，长一百二十二公里；人行道五十四条，长一百六十五公里；梭槽一百一十三条，长二十公里；索道九十六对，长九点五五公里；木轨道十七条，长十八公里。并制木轨车箱八百多个，各种土车子四千零六十部，大大地改变了矿区和炉群的交通运输面貌，解放了劳动力，降低了生产成本。因为贯彻了“小土群”为主的方针，整个工程所花投资很少，像观雾山那样大的工程只用了三百多元。全县10月份搞运煤运矿的劳动力有八万多人，实现“一网四化”后已下降到三万七千六百三十三人，减少劳动力53％。而每天运量却从10月份的一千五百吨提高到八千吨左右，基本上解决了运力紧张的问题。
    实现“一网四化”后，大家的情绪更高，劲头更大，到处充满了一片愉快的心情。重华工区的群众赞扬说：“梭槽如流水，木轨把路开，索道凌空架，矿石天上来。”又说：“人多主意多，车子爬坡坡；矿石空中运，扁担离了身。”可见只要我们坚决克服右倾保守思想，相信群众，依靠群众，大闹技术革命，在短期内改变山区炉群和矿区的交通运输面貌，提高劳动生产率，大大减少劳动力，降低生产成本，是完全可能的。
    虽然我们在“一网四化”工作上取得了一些成绩，但是我们的工作还做得很不够。江彰县现在还有三个矿区尚未全部实现“一网四化”。就是搞得比较好的矿区仍须继续大闹技术革命。特别在采矿、炼铁机械化方面还有许多工作要做。我们计划今后还要大量制造一些碎矿机、碎煤机、选矿机、上料机、土起重机等；将土高炉的人拉风箱改为畜力或水力带动，并加大风量；加速热风炉的建设；逐步将“小土群”改造成为“小洋群”，使矿区炉群走上机械化和半机械化的道路，从而从根本上解决劳动力紧张和产品成本高的问题，争取今年钢铁生产来个更大的跃进。
