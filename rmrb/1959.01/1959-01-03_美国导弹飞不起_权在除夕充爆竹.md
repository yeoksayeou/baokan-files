Xinhua News Agency, Cape Canaveral (USA) Dispatch: The US Navy's consecutive launches of the "Polaris" and "Thor" intermediate-range missiles failed on the eve of the 1959 New Year.

The launch of the "Polaris" missile took place on the morning of December 30 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shortly after launch, this two-stage rocket deviated from its intended course, and the second stage exploded one and a half minutes after launch.

This was the third test in a new series of "Polaris" missile tests. The previous two tests also ended in failure.

The first time was on September 24, when the missile exploded 43 seconds after launch. The second time was on October 15, and this time it failed even before the first stage fuel was completely burned.

The "Thor" missile was launched by the US Air Force at Cape Canaveral on the same night. As soon as this missile lifted off, it deviated from its intended course, flying in a northerly direction instead of vertically. After fifty seconds, having reached a height of only a few hundred feet, it plunged back towards the launch site. At this point, safety officials immediately pressed the button, and the missile exploded into pieces in the air, scattering into the Atlantic Ocean.

    美国导弹飞不起　权在除夕充爆竹
    据新华社讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国海军在1959年新年前夕发射“北极星”和“雷神”中程导弹连续遭到了失败。
    “北极星”导弹的发射是12月30日早晨在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角进行的。这枚两级火箭在发射不久就偏离了预定路线，而第二级在发射一分半钟后就爆炸了。
    这是“北极星”导弹新的一系列试验中的第三次试验。前两次试验也以失败告终。
    第一次是在9月24日，导弹在发射后四十三秒钟就爆炸。第二次是在10月15日，这一次甚至连第一级的燃料都还没有燃烧完毕就失败了。
    “雷神”导弹是同日夜间美国空军在卡纳维拉尔角发射的。这枚导弹刚一升空就偏离了预定路线，不是垂直上升，而是向相当偏北的方向飞去。经过五十秒钟刚刚达到几百呎的高度，它就向发射场栽了回来。这时安全官员立即按动按钮，导弹在空中炸成碎片，散落在大西洋中。
