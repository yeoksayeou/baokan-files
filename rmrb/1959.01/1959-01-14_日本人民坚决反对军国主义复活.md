Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 13th: The Japan Socialist Party, at its Central Executive Committee meeting held on the 12th, formulated its action program for the first half of 1959. The program stipulates that the Socialist Party should focus its struggle on abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and safeguarding livelihood and democracy.

The program also stipulates that the Socialist Party will force the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet to resign through the upcoming Japanese local elections and House of Councillors election.

In order to realize this program, the Socialist Party will launch a high tide of national movements against American military bases and for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. It will change the "National Conference for Opposing the Revision of the Police Duties Execution Law" into the "National Conference for Safeguarding Democracy and Peace" as an organization to oppose the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the same time, the Socialist Party will combine this national movement with its struggle in the ordinary Diet session to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government. The Socialist Party also decided to support the spring struggle of the Japanese working class and strengthen ties with trade union organizations.

This action program will be submitted to the expanded meeting of the Central Committee of the Japan Socialist Party to be held on the 19th and 20th for discussion and adoption.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 13th: Thirty-one prominent figures from all walks of life in Japan jointly issued an appeal today, calling on the Japanese people to participate in the Japan Peace Congress to be held on February 27th and 28th.

The appeal pointed out that the Japanese government and the Japanese people are at a time of making decisions. They must choose between the path of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to make Japan participate in the aggressive system of launching wars of aggression against Asian countries, or the path of abandoning nuclear armament and the ambition to revive imperialism, so that Japan will move towards neutralization and peaceful coexistence. There is absolutely no third path other than these two.

The appeal called on the Japanese people to actively participate in this Peace Congress, concentrate all democratic and peaceful forces, and make the congress establish the basic direction of the Japanese peace movement this year, in order to prevent the conspiracy of Japan and the United States to revise the "Security Treaty," and further strive to abolish this treaty. The appeal emphasized that the current domestic and international situation in Japan is conducive to the forces of peace and democracy. As long as the Japanese people unite on the basis of the achievements of the Japanese peace movement over the past decade, they can make this Peace Congress a congress of decisive significance.

The appeal also pointed out the importance of the upcoming House of Councillors election and local elections. It emphasized that the Japanese forces for peace and democracy must take these elections seriously in order to change the reality of politics, and put forward specific demands in the election struggle, and strive to realize a peaceful and democratic government.

Signatories to the appeal include: Yoshitaro Hirano, Kiyoshi Aono, Kaoru Ota, Akira Kazami, Toki Kushida, Hiroshi Suekawa, Jiichiro Matsumoto, Iku Yasui, Kumaichi Yamamoto, and Kamejiro Senaga, among others.

The Japan Peace Committee held a meeting of its Standing Council yesterday, deciding to formally call the Peace Congress to be held on the 27th and 28th of next month the "Japan Peace Congress for Abolishing the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' Promoting Peaceful Coexistence, Opposing Nuclear Armament and the Revival of Militarism, and Upholding Democracy."

The meeting also decided to establish an implementation committee for the Peace Congress on the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 12th: According to today's "Akahata" report, the southern route of the Fukuoka-Tokyo 1,200-kilometer national march against war and unemployment, which departed from Fukuoka on the 6th, reached Shimonoseki on the 10th amidst the cheers and encouragement of the people along the way.

Representatives from trade unions, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, the Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japan-China Friendship Association and other organizations in the Shimonoseki area, as well as more than 1,600 citizens, rushed to the Shimonoseki Port Wharf to warmly welcome the marching team. Then, a welcoming rally was held in the square in front of the railway station.

After the meeting, all the marchers and more than 1,200 people held a demonstration on the street. When the marching team passed in front of the Shimonoseki City Hall, Shimonoseki Mayor Yasuzo Fukuda personally addressed the marching team to encourage them.

Prior to this, when the marching team arrived in Moji on the 9th, they attended a welcoming rally organized by the Kitakyushu Trade Union Council with the participation of more than 2,500 people. At the meeting, the representative of the Mayor of Moji and representatives of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, trade unions, and farmers' associations spoke to encourage the marching team.

The declaration adopted at the meeting firmly stated that they would work hard to develop the march against war and unemployment into a movement of all the Japanese people, and strive to build a Japan without war and unemployment.

The Central Executive Committee of the National March issued an appeal on the day the marching team departed from Fukuoka, saying that 1959 is a very important year, which will be a year full of activities such as revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," policies hostile to China, revising the Constitution, and further making Japan an aggressive base. If the Japanese people stand idly by, Japan's security and economy will fall into the abyss of crisis. The appeal called on Japanese workers, farmers, peace groups, and citizens to join the ranks of the National March against war and unemployment, so that this march movement will become a national movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

The Central Committee of the Japan Communist Party also sent a telegram to the marching team on the same day, encouraging them to achieve victory in overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet and striving for Japan's independence and peace. (Attached picture)

    日本人民坚决反对军国主义复活
    社会党决定以废除日美“安全条约”为重点展开斗争
    和平委员会准备召开和平大会　反对战争大游行队伍正在行进中
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党在12日召开的中央执行委员会会议上制定了1959年上半年的行动纲领。纲领规定社会党要以废除日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交和维护生活和民主为重点展开斗争。
    纲领还规定社会党要通过将要举行的日本地方选举和参议院选举迫使岸信介内阁辞职。
    为了实现这项纲领，社会党要掀起一个反对美国军事基地和恢复日中邦交的国民运动的高潮，并且把“反对修改警察官职务执行法国民会议”改为“维护民主与和平国民会议”，作为反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动组织。同时，社会党要把这项国民运动和它在平时国会会议上进行的打倒岸信介政府的斗争结合起来。社会党还决定支援日本工人阶级的春季斗争，加强同工会组织的联系。
    这项行动纲领将提交十九、二十日两天召开的日本社会党中央委员会扩大会议上讨论和通过。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本三十一位各界著名人士今天联合发表呼吁书，号召日本人民参加将在2月27日和28日两天举行的日本和平大会。
    呼吁书指出，日本政府和日本人民正处在下决断的时期，他们要选择修改日美“安全条约”以便使日本参加对亚洲国家发动侵略战争的侵略体系的道路，或者是选择抛弃核武装和复活帝国主义的野心，使日本走向中立化和和平共处的道路，除了这两条道路以外绝对没有第三条道路。
    呼吁书号召日本人民积极参加这次和平大会，集中一切民主、和平力量，使大会确立今年日本和平运动的基本方向，以阻止日美修改
  “安全条约”的阴谋，并且进而争取废除这项条约。呼吁书强调指出，目前日本国内外形势有利于和平、民主力量，只要日本人民在十年来日本和平运动的成就的基础上团结起来，就能够使这次和平大会成为富有决定性意义的大会。
    呼吁书并且指出了即将举行的参议员选举和地方选举的重要性，同时强调指出，日本和平、民主力量为了改变现实政治，必须认真对待这些选举，并且在选举斗争中提出具体的要求，为实现和平、民主的政府而努力。
    在呼吁书上签名的有：平野义太郎、青野季吉、太田熏、风见章、栉田富贵、末川博、松本治一郎、安井郁、山本熊一和濑长龟次郎等。
    日本和平委员会昨天举行常任理事会会议，决定把将在下月27日和28日举行的和平大会正式称为“争取废除日美‘安全条约’、促进和平共处，反对核武装和复活军国主义、拥护民主的日本和平大会”。
    会议还决定，将在16日成立和平大会实行委员会。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，6日从福冈启程的福冈—东京一千二百公里反对战争和失业国民大游行的南路队伍，在沿途人民的欢迎和鼓舞的呼声中于10日达到下关。
    下关地区的工会、日本社会党、日本共产党、禁止原子弹氢弹协议会、日中友好协会等组织的代表以及市民一千六百多人特地赶往下关港码头热烈欢迎游行队伍。接着，又在火车站前面广场举行欢迎大会。
    大会结束后，全体游行队员和一千二百多名群众到街上举行了示威游行。当游行队伍路过下关市政府门前时，下关市长福田泰三亲自向游行队伍讲话，加以鼓舞。
    在这以前，游行队伍在9日到达门司时，出席了由北九州工会协议会主办的有二千五百多群众参加的欢迎大会。在会上门司市长代表和社会党、共产党、工会、农民协会等的代表都讲话鼓舞游行队伍。
    大会通过的宣言坚决表示，他们将努力把反对战争和失业的游行发展成为日本全体人民的运动，并且为建设没有战争和失业的日本而奋斗。
    国民大游行中央实行委员会在游行队伍从福冈出发当天，曾经发表呼吁书说，1959年是非常重要的一年，将是充满修改日美“安全条约”、敌视中国的政策、修改宪法、进一步使日本成为侵略基地等活动的一年。日本人民如果袖手旁观，将使日本的安全和经济坠入危机深渊。呼吁书号召日本的工人、农民、和平团体和市民都投入反对战争和失业的国民大游行行列里来，使这个游行运动成为打倒岸信介内阁的国民运动。
    日本共产党中央委员会也在同一天打电报给游行队伍，鼓舞他们在打倒岸信介内阁、争取日本的独立和和平方面取得胜利。（附图片）
