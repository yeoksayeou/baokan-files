Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. In the year 1958, when China's industrial and agricultural production achieved a great leap forward, the work of the national banks and people's commune credit cooperatives was very active. Through the organization, regulation, and economical and rational use of working capital, they not only promptly met the capital needs of all relevant parties in the Great Leap Forward, but also reduced waste in the use of working capital.

In terms of absorbing and organizing mass funds, the various deposits absorbed by the People's Banks across the country (calculated by balance), as of December 20th last year, increased by one and a half times compared to the end of 1957, and more than three times compared to 1953, the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. The increase in mass deposits indicates, on the one hand, that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to support socialist construction has reached an unprecedented high, and on the other hand, it also shows that due to the development of production, the income of the Chinese people last year increased compared to previous years.

The use of loan funds by the national banks includes three main aspects: supporting industrial production, supporting agricultural production, and supporting commercial and grain departments in the procurement of industrial and agricultural products.

In 1958, the proportion of loans supporting industrial production in the total loan portfolio increased from 12% in 1953 to 20%. During this year, the bank fully supported the development of local industries with large amounts of funds. According to statistics, as of December 20th, excluding loans that had already been repaid, loans granted by national banks to local industries increased more than tenfold compared to a year earlier. In order to implement the principle of economical and rational use of working capital, the national banks dispatched a large number of credit officers to help industrial enterprises make careful calculations, fully tap the potential of materials and funds, and strive to increase production with less capital, and many enterprises even achieved increased production without increasing capital, thereby saving a large amount of capital for the country.

In terms of supporting agricultural production, the agricultural loan target for this year was slightly higher than the previous year, and the actual amount of loans granted increased significantly compared to previous years. Thanks to the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the work of recovering matured agricultural loans was stepped up everywhere. In addition, the national banks and people's commune credit cooperatives accelerated the turnover of credit funds. Therefore, the total amount of agricultural loans issued throughout the year was greater than in any previous year, equivalent to more than twice the average accumulated amount issued annually during the First Five-Year Plan period. According to an analysis of the use of agricultural loans in eleven provinces and autonomous regions in the first half of last year (loans were mainly issued in the first half of the year), the vast majority were used to help agricultural production cooperatives and people's communes solve production expenses, including water conservancy construction, and the purchase of fertilizers and seeds. This is in line with the spirit of helping people's communes vigorously increase production. Before issuing these loans, the staff of national banks and credit cooperatives in various localities, under the leadership of the Party committees, helped agricultural cooperatives and people's communes analyze their financial situation based on the principle of using as little as possible and using less rather than more. They verified the actual needs before issuing the loans. Therefore, the vast majority of loans were used for production needs.

The great victory of the rectification movement and the proposal of the Party's general line for building socialism have brought great improvements to banking work. Based on the feedback from enterprises and the masses, and in order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the national banks boldly abolished and extensively revised some of the complex systems and methods, in the spirit of drastically breaking with the old and establishing the new. Parts that were still applicable were retained, and new methods created by the masses and welcomed by enterprises were affirmed and promoted. These played a certain role in supporting industrial and agricultural production in a timely and effective manner.

### 吸收群众资金　支持工农业生产  银行工作空前活跃

    吸收群众资金　支持工农业生产
    银行工作空前活跃
    据新华社3日讯　在我国工农业生产大跃进的1958年里，国家银行和人民公社信用部的工作非常活跃，它们通过对流动资金的组织、调节和节约而合理的运用，既及时地满足了有关各方面在大跃进中对资金的需要，也减少了流动资金使用上的浪费现象。
    在吸收和组织群众资金方面，全国各地人民银行吸收到的各种存款（按余额计），到去年12月20日为止，比1957年末增长了一倍半，如与第一个五年计划开始的1953年相比，则增长了三倍还多。群众存款的增长，一方面说明了广大人民群众支援社会主义建设的热情空前高涨，另一方面也说明由于生产的发展，我国人民去年的收入比往年又有增加。
    国家银行对贷款资金的运用，包括支持工业生产、支持农业生产和支持商业、粮食部门对工农业产品收购等三个主要方面。
    1958年支持工业生产的贷款在总的贷款比重中，由1953年的12％增长到了20％。这一年内，银行以大笔资金充分支持了地方工业的发展。据统计，截至12月20日止，除了已经归还的贷款以外，国家银行贷给地方工业的贷款比一年以前增长了十倍以上。国家银行为了贯彻节约地合理地使用流动资金的原则，曾派出大批信贷员，帮助工业企业精打细算，充分挖掘物资和资金的潜力，尽量做到多增加生产少增加资金，甚至许多企业还做到了增产不增资，从而为国家节约了大笔资金。
    在支持农业生产方面，这一年的农贷指标，比上年略有增加，实际贷放数比往年增加很多。由于在各级党委的领导下，各地抓紧了收回到期农贷的工作，加上国家银行和人民公社信用部加速了信贷资金的周转，因此全年的农贷放出数比以往任何一年都要大，相当于第一个五年计划期间每年平均累计放出数的两倍以上。根据十一个省、自治区去年上半年（放款主要在上半年）的农贷使用用途分析，绝大部分都用在帮助农业生产合作社和人民公社解决生产费用方面，其中包括兴修水利、购买肥料和种籽等。这是符合帮助人民公社大力进行增产这一精神的。在发放这些贷款之前，各地国家银行和信用部的工作人员都是在党委领导下，帮助农业社和人民公社本着能不用就不用、能少用就不多用的原则，分析了财务资金情况，按照确实需要加以核实，才进行发放。因此，绝大部分贷款都使用到了生产需要的方面。
    整风运动的伟大胜利和党的建设社会主义总路线的提出，使银行工作有很大的改进。国家银行根据企业和群众的反映，适应工农业生产大跃进的需要，对于繁杂的各种制度和办法，本着大破大立的精神，大胆地进行了部分废止和大量修改，对于现在仍然适用的部分，仍旧继续保留，同时，对于群众创造而为企业所欢迎的新办法，也予以肯定和推广，这些对于及时有效地支持工农业生产起了一定的作用。
