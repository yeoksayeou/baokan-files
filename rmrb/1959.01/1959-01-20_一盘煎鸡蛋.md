With temples frosted with grey, Air Force Lieutenant General Cheng Jun, when he came to serve as a soldier in an anti-aircraft unit's squad, used the name he had used twenty years ago during the Red Army days: Cheng Benxing. For seven days now, every time meat was served, he would give the meat from his bowl to other soldiers. This made squad leader Zhu Weili and others feel awkward. Was this "new recruit" not eating meat, or what? He himself didn't say.

One day, breakfast was about to be served, and Zhu Weili said to Cheng Benxing, "Let's eat in the dormitory today!" As soon as the squad leader said this, it immediately aroused great suspicion in Cheng Benxing: Usually eating was in the dining hall, what's going on today? He couldn't help but ask the squad leader, "Why aren't we eating in the dining hall?" Zhu Weili answered simply, "Today is special." After a while, he brought over a plate of fried eggs. This was because the soldiers saw that he wasn't eating meat and felt a bit sorry, so they specially made it for him. But no matter how the soldiers tried to persuade him, Cheng Benxing resolutely refused to eat it. In the end, he still took his own bowl and chopsticks and went to the dining hall to eat. Regarding this meal, the General made a suggestion to the company, saying: "Life in the past was much harder than this, what does this count as hardship? Today I am here to train, anything the comrades can eat, I can eat; any place the comrades can live, I can live; any technology the comrades can master, I must learn. I hope the comrades don't treat me like a 'guest'." (Attached image)

    一盘煎鸡蛋
    鬓发霜白的成钧空军中将，来防空部队一班当兵时，改用了二十年前当红军时的名字：成本兴。已经有七天了，每逢吃肉，他都要把自己碗内的肉给别的战士吃。这可把班长朱维礼等难坏了。这位“新兵”是不吃肉，还是怎么的？他本人也不讲。
    有一天，快开早饭了，朱维礼对成本兴说：“今天我们在宿舍里吃饭吧！”班长这么一说，马上引起成本兴很大的怀疑：吃饭本来要到食堂，今天怎么啦？他忍不住问班长：“为什么不到饭堂吃呢？”朱维礼也答得干脆：“今天特殊。”一会儿，他端来了一盘煎鸡蛋。这是战士们看他不吃肉，心中有些过意不去，专门给他煎作的。但是无论战士怎样地劝说，成本兴坚决不肯吃，最后，他还是拿了自己的碗筷，到食堂吃饭去了。为了这顿饭，将军给连里提了意见，他说：“过去生活比这艰苦得多，现在算得什么苦。今天我是下来锻炼的，同志们能吃的东西，我都能吃；同志们能住的地方，我也能住，同志们能掌握的技术，我也要学会，希望同志们不要把我当‘客人’。”（附图片）
