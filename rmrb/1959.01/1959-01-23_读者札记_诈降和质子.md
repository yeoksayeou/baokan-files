    Reader's Notes
    Feigned Surrender and Hostages
    Liu Mianzhi

    In the Battle of Red Cliffs, there were two instances of feigned surrender. One was when Cao Cao instructed Cai Zhong and Cai He to feign surrender to Sun Quan, citing the reason that their elder brother Cai Mao had been killed. Before their departure, Cao Cao told them, "Your family members are currently in Jingzhou, and I will take good care of them." Precisely because they didn't bring their families, Huang Gai saw through their feigned surrender. The other instance was Huang Gai's feigned surrender to Cao Cao, using the stratagem of the "bitter flesh" ruse. Zhou Yu beat Huang Gai in front of Cai Zhong and Cai He, and Cao Cao indeed believed it, suffering a great loss from the fire attack.

    Surrenderers should bring their families, and Cao Cao, when instructing people to feign surrender, also detained their families. In feudal society, the families of military officers have always been regarded as collateral. There's a specific term for this: "zhi" (质, hostage) and "zhiren" (质任, hostage duty).

    The earliest example found in historical records is the exchange of hostages between Zhou and Zheng. Duke Zhuang of Zheng served as a minister to King Ping of Zhou. King Ping was on good terms with the Duke of Guo, which displeased Duke Zhuang of Zheng, who complained. King Ping explained repeatedly, but it was no use, so they had to exchange sons as collateral. Prince Hu of Zhou was a hostage in Zheng, and Prince Hu of Zheng was a hostage in Zhou. One was a king, and the other was a feudal lord. The monarch and his subject were at odds and had to resolve it by exchanging collateral. This was a great joke at the time (Zuo Zhuan, Year 3 of Duke Yin of Lu). However, it also illustrates another situation: the unilateral submission of collateral between enemy states, small and large countries, weak and strong countries, or subjects to rulers, etc., was considered reasonable and lawful.

    There are many examples from the Three Kingdoms period. After Cao Cao was defeated by Zhang Xiu, he said to his generals, "My mistake in surrendering to Zhang Xiu was not taking his 'zhi' (hostage), which led to this situation. Having suffered this loss, I have learned a lesson. From now on, watch me, and I will never suffer another defeat." (Records of the Three Kingdoms, Wei Shu, Vol. 1) The lesson he learned was to take other people's 'zhi' (hostage). With living people as collateral, he could force people to obey and prevent them from daring or being willing to rebel. Gongsun Huang, the brother of Gongsun Yuan of Liaodong, was a hostage in Luoyang. When Gongsun Yuan raised troops, Huang was killed. (Ibid., Vol. 8, Biography of Gongsun Du; Vol. 24, Biography of Gao Rou) In the Wei system, counties were divided into three classes: "ju" (剧, critical), "zhong" (中, middle), and "ping" (平, peaceful). "Zhong" and "ping" were the inland areas, where people had heavier taxes and duties. Border areas near the enemy were classified as "ju," where people had lighter taxes and duties, but the prefects had to send their sons to Ye as collateral. (Ibid., Biography of Wang Guan) The Wu and Shu states were the same.

    In the early Jin Dynasty, it was stipulated that all generals and below, including the supervisors of tribal troops, had to send "zhiren" (质任, hostage duty) or "renzi" (任子, sons for appointment). (Book of Jin, Vol. 2, 3, 7)

    In the early Northern Song Dynasty, it was stipulated that all officials serving in border prefectures and counties had to concurrently hold nominal positions in inland prefectures and counties, and were only allowed to travel to their posts alone, with their families remaining in their inland postings. (History of the Song Dynasty, Vol. 275, Biography of Tan Yanmei)

    Emperor Taizu of Ming controlled his generals very strictly, and issued an order: "The wives and children of the commanding generals who capture cities for me must reside in the capital and are not allowed to move out." (Liu Chen's Records of Early Ming Dynasty)

    From these examples, it can be seen that in feudal society, there was no basis for mutual trust between military leaders and emperors towards their subordinate generals and border officials. The method to ensure unity was to use the families of the generals or border officials as collateral to gain trust, which was called "committing oneself to another" (委质于人). Cao Cao's demand that Sun Quan send a hostage was the same idea.

    读者札记
    诈降和质子
    刘勉之
    赤壁之战里有两起诈降，一起是曹操教蔡中、蔡和诈降孙权，理由是因为兄长蔡瑁被杀。临行时曹操对他二人说：“二位将军的宝眷现在荆州，必当妥为照应。”恰也正因为不带家眷，被黄盖识破是诈降。一起是黄盖诈降曹操，用苦肉计，周瑜当着蔡中、蔡和打了黄盖一顿，曹操果然相信了，吃了火攻的大亏。
    投降要带家眷，曹操教人诈降也要扣留家眷，带兵官的家眷在封建社会里历来是被当作抵押品的。有个专门名词叫作“质”，和“质任”。
    最早见于史书的例子是周郑交质，郑庄公作周平王的卿士，平王和虢公要好，郑庄公不高兴，发牢骚，平王再三解释还不行，只好交换儿子作抵押，周王子狐为质于郑，郑公子忽为质于周。一个是王，一个是诸侯，君臣两人闹蹩扭，只好用交换的抵押品来解决。在当时是个大笑话。（左传鲁隐公三年）但是也说明了另外一种情况，那就是在敌国之间、小国大国之间、弱国强国之间或者是臣对君等等的片面的交纳抵押品的行为，是被认为合理合法的。
    三国时的例子很多，曹操为张绣所败后，对诸将说：“我降了张绣，错在没有取他的‘质’，弄到这个地步。吃了这个亏，长了一智，你们看着吧，从今以后，再也不吃败仗了。”（三国志魏志一）他学到的乖就是取人家的‘质’，有了活人抵押作保证，就可以强迫人服从，不敢也不忍造反。辽东公孙渊兄晃在洛阳作质子，公孙渊起兵，晃就被杀。（同上卷八公孙度传，卷二十四高柔传）魏的制度，郡县分剧、中、平三等，中、平是内地，人民赋役就重一些，边地近敌的就列为剧，人民赋役轻一些，但是太守要送任子到邺作抵押。（同上王观传）吴、蜀两国也是如此。
    晋初规定诸将以下部曲督都要送质任或任子。（晋书卷二、三、七）
    北宋初年规定，凡是作边地州郡官的，都要挂名兼任内地的州郡官，只许单身赴任，家眷留在内地任所。（宋史卷二百七十五谭延美传）
    明太祖控制诸将很严密，下令：“与我取城子的总兵官，妻子俱要在京住坐，不许搬取出外。”（刘辰明初事迹）
    从这些例子可以看出，封建社会里的军事首领和帝王对他们的部将和边地守土官员之间，互相信任的基础是不存在的，保证一致的办法是把部将或边地官员的家眷作抵押品，以取得信任，叫作“委质于人”。曹操要孙权送质子就是这个意思。
