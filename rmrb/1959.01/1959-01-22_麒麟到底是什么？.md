    What Exactly is the Qilin?
    Yang Min

    A reader from Tianjin, Ma Munong, wrote: "In Comrade Guo Moruo's note to his poem "Ode to the Lingzhi Mushroom of Huangshan" in your newspaper on December 28, 1958, page 8, he said: "Qilin is the giraffe," while Comrade Fan Wenlan said in the article "Eliminating Superstition" in the second issue of "Red Flag" last year: "No one has ever seen a qilin, phoenix, or dragon"? Does the qilin actually exist? Is it the "giraffe?" We have asked Comrade Yang Min to provide the following answer to this question. ——Editor

    The qilin is traditionally said to be an auspicious beast, and together with the dragon, phoenix, and turtle, is known as the four spirits. When craftsmen paint it, they always cover it with scales and insert wings. Some even believe it can eat metal and dung... Needless to say, such an animal does not actually exist, but is merely a product of people's imagination.

    However, imagination is not entirely without basis. It is likely that people saw giraffes in the past, but due to limited knowledge at the time, they did not understand the details of this animal, so rumors spread and stories were fabricated, resulting in various misunderstandings. Furthermore, the ruling class took advantage of this, exaggerating and embellishing it, so that an animal that actually existed and could be understood became mysterious and inconceivable. Therefore, if we are to say that the qilin exists, it actually refers to the giraffe.

    The first reason for saying that the qilin is the giraffe is that the habits of the giraffe are very consistent with the ancient descriptions of the qilin. For example, the qilin was once thought to be a docile animal, and giraffes are indeed very docile. Although they have horns, hooves, and a tall stature, they generally do not use their horns and hooves to attack people or other animals, except when faced with sudden and unavoidable aggression. The "Mao Shi Lu Shu Guang Yao" states: "Those with feet should kick, but the qilin's feet can kick but do not kick, which is its benevolence. Those with foreheads should butt, but the qilin's forehead can butt but does not butt. Those with horns should touch, but the qilin's horns can touch but do not touch." Comparing these characteristics with the temperament of the giraffe, nothing could be more similar. It was also believed that the qilin was good at running, so good horses were often compared to the qilin. The "Lun Heng Shuo Ri Pian" specifically says that the qilin can travel a thousand li in a day and night. The giraffe is also known for its ability to run, and its speed can indeed reach more than 30 kilometers per hour.

    Secondly, the records of the qilin's physical form in ancient books are also very consistent with the giraffe. For example, the "Ming Shi Wai Guo Chuan" says: "The qilin's front feet are nine feet tall, the hind feet are six feet tall, the neck is sixteen feet and two inches long, it has two short horns, an ox's tail and a deer's body, and it eats millet and bean cakes." As for the qilin's horns having flesh at the ends, this also corresponds to the giraffe's horns having a layer of velvet on the ends.

    According to historical records, during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, the countries of Banggela and Malindi sent envoys to China to present qilin. The book "Yingya Shenglan" states that qilin are produced in the country of Aden. Banggela and Aden are relatively close to Africa, and Malindi is located on the African continent, and Africa is precisely the origin of giraffes.

    The characters for qilin both contain the radical "deer," indicating that the qilin seen by the ancients must have been similar to deer-like animals. Throughout history, the literature has stated that the qilin is like a roe deer, or that it is like a roe, and some even simply say that the qilin is a large female deer. Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, in the "Lun Heng Jiang Rui Pian," mentioned that the qilin may be an animal like the roe deer, which can be said to be the first attempt to unravel the mystery of the qilin.

    In conclusion, based on the above points, it is sufficient to prove that the qilin is the giraffe.

    麒麟到底是什么？
    杨旻
    天津读者马慕农来信说：“郭沫若同志在你报1958年12月28日第八版“咏黄山灵芝草”诗注中说：“麒麟，即长颈鹿”，而范文澜同志在“红旗”去年第二期“破除迷信”一文中则说：“麟凤龙谁也没有见过”？究竟麒麟是否存在？是不是“长颈鹿？”对这个问题，我们请杨旻同志作如下的答复。　　　——编者
    麒麟相传是一种瑞兽，和龙、凤、龟合称为四灵。工匠们画起它来，总要替它涂上鳞甲，插上翅膀。也有相信它能茹鈌粪金的……不用说，像这样的动物，实际上并不存在，不过是人们的一种想像而已。
    然而，想像也并不是完全没有凭借的。大概从前人们看到了长颈鹿，但当时由于知识所限，不了解这种动物的底细，因此以讹传讹，穿凿附会，便演成种种误解，再加以统治阶级从中利用，大事渲染夸大，于是一种本来存在、可以理解的动物，便变得神秘不可思议了。所以如果要说有麒麟的话，那实际上是指的长颈鹿。
    说麒麟就是长颈鹿，第一是因为长颈鹿的习性，同古代所描述的麒麟很相符。例如从前认为麒麟是一种温驯的动物，长颈鹿就是非常温驯的。虽然它们有角、有蹄、身材高大，但除了遇到突然的、不可逃避的侵犯以外，一般是不会使用它们的角和蹄来攻击人们或其他动物的。毛诗陆疏广要一书写道：“有足者宜踶，唯麟之足可以踶而不踶，是其仁也。有额者宜抵，唯麟之额可以抵而不抵。有角宜触，唯麟之角可以触而不触”。按照这些特点把它和长颈鹿的性情比起来，再相似也没有了。从前又认为麒麟善走，所以常常把良马用麒麟来比喻，论衡说日篇更具体地说麒麟在一昼夜间可行一千里。长颈鹿也正是以善于奔驰而著称的，它的行速，的确可以达到每小时三十公里以上。
    其次，古籍上关于麒麟形体的记载，和长颈鹿也非常符合。例如明史外国传说：“麒麟前足高九尺，后足六尺，颈长丈六尺有二，有二短角，牛尾鹿身，食粟豆饼饵”。至于说麒麟的角端载肉，也和长颈鹿的角端复有一层茸毛的情形相符合。
    据史籍所载，明永乐时榜葛刺国和麻林国曾遣使来中国献麒麟，瀛涯胜览一书则载阿丹国产麒麟。榜葛刺和阿丹都较邻近非洲，麻林国则在非洲本土，而非洲也正是长颈鹿的产地。
    麒麟两字都从“鹿”，足见古人所见到的麒麟，一定是和鹿一类的动物类似，历代的文献中不是说麒麟像獐，就是说它像麕，也有干脆说麟是大牝鹿的。东汉时代的王充，在论衡讲瑞篇中，就曾提到麒麟可能就是獐鹿一类的动物，这可以说是试图揭开麒麟之谜的第一声。
    总之，根据以上各点看来，已足可证明麒麟就是长颈鹿了。
