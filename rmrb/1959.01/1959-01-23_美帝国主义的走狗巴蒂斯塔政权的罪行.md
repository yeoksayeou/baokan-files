The Batista regime, running dog of U.S. imperialism, ruled Cuba for seventeen years. During this period, Cuba was filled with persecution and terror. In the seven years after Batista's return to power in 1952 alone, 20,000 Cubans were killed. News leaked in May 1958 that in three major Cuban cities alone, 300 people from literary and artistic circles had been brutally murdered recently. Now, many "secret cemeteries" have been discovered throughout Cuba, with dozens or hundreds of bodies of victims of collective massacres by Batista elements being exhumed.

The Batista ruling clique's frantic suppression and persecution of the Cuban people can be seen in a letter from Cuba published in an Argentine newspaper in February 1958: It wrote: "Currently, all the towns and villages of Cuba are filled with terror. Hundreds of people are shot, or hanged from trees after being tortured, or found dead on the roads. Most of those killed have had their fingernails pulled out and their eyeballs gouged out..." Last winter, as the Batista regime was on the verge of collapse, the terror and persecution intensified. According to appeals from Cuban women to foreign countries, the bodies of people tortured to death appeared every day on the central streets of the capital. They were covered with the scars of brutal torture in the torture chambers for political prisoners. The appeal pointed out that the police chief blatantly ordered that wherever a bomb exploded, there must be at least one body of a so-called culprit displayed as a warning. Therefore, the police would grab the first person walking down the street and shoot them on the spot, or arbitrarily drag a political prisoner who had suffered torture in the torture chamber to the scene to be shot.

During the Batista regime, prisons were filled with workers, peasants, Communist Party members, trade union cadres, students, liberal professionals, and insurgent soldiers. Among those who were severely tortured and murdered were fifteen-year-old children and women. The criminal laws used by Batista elements were extremely brutal and appalling, including needle pricks, whippings, electric shocks, burning with welding torches and cigarettes, and injecting the victims with drugs. They also arrested the wives, daughters, and family members of the victims to threaten them with rape or inflict barbaric punishments in front of them.

Under the rule of the Batista regime, Cuba became a large concentration camp, and the people's basic civil rights were completely destroyed. The Batista regime abolished the constitution, declared the Communist Party illegal, arrested leaders of the labor movement, strictly censored newspapers, radio, television, and movies, prohibited the celebration of "May Day" and mass activities, and arbitrarily promulgated reactionary decrees, placing Cuba under a state of martial law. For example, in April of last year, Batista blatantly issued a decree authorizing people in various districts of the country to freely shoot and kill people designated as revolutionaries. The police and security personnel of the Batista regime often searched residential homes late at night, broke down doors, kidnapped residents, looted freely, tortured, and raped women. A 1957 article in the Uruguayan "People's Daily" pointed out that in Havana, the capital of Cuba, it was risky to walk on the streets after six o'clock in the evening, and one could easily be killed or imprisoned. A communication in the American "Christian Science Monitor" on December 5, 1958, also revealed that the Havana police would stop and question even groups of three or five young people walking on the street. The communication said that the Batista dictator's reign of terror had reached an unprecedented level, with military personnel monitoring each other. For example, "Officer A is sent to monitor Officer B, and then Officer C is asked to keep an eye on Officer A." As a result, the morale of the army plummeted. It even went so far that in Santiago City, even thirty-seven women who walked out of a Catholic church in a line, praying and holding signs demanding peace, were dragged to prison. Even auditors sent by the National Bank to carry out routine audits were arrested.

The Batista regime levied exorbitant taxes and oppressed the peasants in every possible way. In 1957, under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, the Batista regime drove 30,000 peasants, regardless of men, women, old, young, and pregnant women, from the eastern mountainous areas to concentration camps in Santiago, Bayamo, and other places. The peasants' livestock were abandoned, crops were lost, and they suffered from hunger and cold. Even city residents who wanted to provide them with some food and clothing were abused or arrested by soldiers. In areas where guerrillas were active, Batista's air force carried out indiscriminate bombing and strafing, and the army carried out large-scale "sweeps," burning houses, destroying crops, and killing people "suspected" of "collaborating" with the insurgents. The atrocities that occurred in Minas Bueycito in 1958 were a typical example. Here, Batista's soldiers arrested the owner of a rural shop on the charge of "aiding the rebels," killed him in front of his young son, then shot and killed his young son, then strafed the peasants present, and finally raped a rural female teacher who protested.

The criminal acts of the Batista elements were carried out under the instructions and support of reactionary forces in the United States. An article in the "New French Weekly" on March 13, 1958, pointed out that Batista's various repressive activities against the Cuban people were assisted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). When Communist Party members were tortured, FBI personnel participated in the interrogation. A minister in the Batista government was once concerned about a detainee in a certain case, but he stopped asking about it later, saying: "The Americans are in charge of this case."

Military Order No. 30, promulgated by the Cuban insurgent forces in 1958, exposed the crimes of the United States in supporting the Batista regime in slaughtering the Cuban people. The military order pointed out: "The inhumane rulers of the United States...armed the Batista dictatorship to the teeth to slaughter our people." The military order revealed: "Faced with countless machine gun strafings and bombings, including white phosphorus bombs, napalm bombs, and cluster bombs. The planes are American planes, and the pilots are trained in American camps... This is not only against our insurgents, but also against the unarmed peasants in the vast areas controlled by the Second Front army." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔政权的罪行

    美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔政权的罪行
    美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔前后统治古巴十七年。在此期间，古巴充满迫害和恐怖。仅在巴蒂斯塔1952年重新登位的七年来，就有两万古巴人民遭到杀戮。1958年5月有消息透露，只是在近日在古巴的三个大城市中，就有三百个文学界和艺术界人士惨遭杀害。现在，古巴全国各地已经发现了不少“秘密墓地”，挖掘出成十、成百具惨被巴蒂斯塔分子集体屠杀的死难者的遗体。
    巴蒂斯塔统治集团对古巴人民的疯狂镇压与迫害，可以从1958年2月阿根廷报纸刊载的古巴来信中看出：它写道：“目前，古巴所有的城镇和农村到处充满了恐怖，成百个人被枪杀，或在受过酷刑以后被吊死在树上，或发现死在路上。被杀的人大都指甲被拔掉，眼珠被剜去……。”去年冬季，巴蒂斯塔政权岌岌可危，恐怖迫害更变本加厉，根据古巴妇女给外国的呼吁书所揭露，每天在首都的中央大街上都出现被折磨死的人的尸体。他们身上布满着政治犯刑讯室中野蛮拷打的伤痕。呼吁书指出，警察局长悍然下令，不论在什么地方，如有炸弹爆炸，就至少要有一个所谓爆炸祸首的尸体示众。因此警察就抓住第一个走过这条街的人，立即就地枪杀，或者任意抓出一个在刑讯室中备受苦刑的政治犯到出事地点来枪杀。
    在巴蒂斯塔统治时期，监狱中关满了工人、农民、共产党员、工会干部、学生、自由职业者和起义的军人。遭受严刑拷打并被残杀的人中，包括十五岁的孩子和妇女。巴蒂斯塔分子采用的刑法十分残暴，令人发指，包括针刺、鞭打、电刑、用焊灯和纸烟来烧以及给受刑人注射药剂等，还把受刑人的妻女家属捕来，用强奸来威吓或当面施加野蛮刑罚。
    在巴蒂斯塔政权的统治下，古巴全国变成一个大集中营，人民的基本公民权利被摧残殆尽。巴蒂斯塔政权废止宪法、宣布共产党非法、逮捕工人运动领导人、严格检查报纸、电台、电视和电影、禁止庆祝“五一”活动和群众活动以及任意颁布反动法令，使古巴实际处于戒严状态。如在去年4月，巴蒂斯塔就曾公然颁布法令，授权国内各区的人自由开枪来射杀被指为革命分子的人。巴蒂斯塔政权的警宪人员常深夜搜查居民住宅、打破大门、绑架居民、尽情劫掠、用刑和强奸妇女。1957年4月乌拉圭“人民报”的文章指出，在古巴首都哈瓦那，晚上六点以后在大街上走是很冒险的，很可能被打死或被关进监狱。1958年12月5日的美国“基督教科学箴言报”的通讯也透露，哈瓦那的警察对走在街上三、五成群的青年人也要止住和盘问。通讯说，巴蒂斯塔独裁者的特务统治已经到了空前绝后的地步，军事人员之间都互相监视，例如，“派军官甲去监视军官乙，然后要军官丙去钉军官甲的梢”，结果，军队士气一蹶不振。事情甚至于这样，在圣地亚哥城，连三十七名一面祈祷，一面手执要求和平的标语从天主教堂列队走出来的妇女也被拖去坐牢，连国民银行派出作例行稽查工作的稽查员们也都被捕。
    巴蒂斯塔政权对农民横征暴敛，百端压迫。1957年间，巴蒂斯塔政权以搜捕游击队为借口，竟把东部山区的三万农民，不分男女老幼和孕妇，都赶到圣地亚哥、巴雅摩等地的集中营去。农民的牲畜被抛弃，谷物都损失了，无衣无食，备受饥寒，而连想给他们一些衣食帮助的城市居民都受到士兵的虐待或者被捕。在游击队活动的地区，巴蒂斯塔的空军施行滥炸和扫射，陆军则大肆“扫荡”，烧毁房屋，毁坏庄稼，杀害“私通”起义者“嫌疑”的人。1958年在米纳斯布埃伊西托发生的暴行是一件典型事例，在这里，巴蒂斯塔的士兵逮捕了一个农村店铺的主人，以“援助叛乱者”为罪名，当他小儿子的面加以杀害，然后又开枪打死他的小儿子，接着又扫射在场的农民，最后还强奸提出抗议的一个农村女教师。
    巴蒂斯塔分子的罪恶行为是在美国反动势力的指使和支持下进行的。1958年3月13日的“新法兰西周刊”的文章指出，巴蒂斯塔对古巴人民的种种镇压活动得到了美国联邦调查局的帮助。当共产党员被拷打时，美国联邦调查局人员参加讯问。巴蒂斯塔政府的一个部长曾经关心某案的一个被拘留者，后来他不再过问了，他说：“美国人在管这一起案件。”
    古巴起义部队在1958年颁布的第三十号军令中，揭露了美国支持巴蒂斯塔政权屠杀古巴人民的罪行。军令指出：“美国不人道的统治者……把巴蒂斯塔独裁政权武装到牙齿，来屠杀我国人民。”军令揭露：“面对着无数次罪恶的机枪扫射和轰炸，包括活性磷弹、凝固汽油弹和榴霰弹。飞机是美国的飞机，驾驶员是在美国的营地训练出来的……这不仅是对付我们的起义军，而且更是为了对付在第二战线军队所控制的广大地区的手无寸铁的农民”。（新华社）
