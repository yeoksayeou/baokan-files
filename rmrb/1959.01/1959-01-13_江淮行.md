A Trip to Jianghuai
By our reporters Tang Tianzhen and Chen Chongfa

In mid-December of last year, we visited the several emerging steel bases along the Huainan Railway and on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

We started from Hefei and successively visited Bengbu and Huainan cities along the Huainan Railway, then crossed the Yangtze River to visit Wuhu, Ma'anshan, and Fanchang. All along the way, furnaces roared, and molten iron flowed. The railway line and the south bank of the Yangtze River resembled two long steel dragons. We had interviewed along the line three months before. At that time, besides small indigenous furnaces in production, many small modern furnaces were just beginning to be built. Now the situation has changed greatly, and small indigenous furnaces have given way to "small modern clusters."

	The First Small Modern Blast Furnace

We visited the steel plant of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee outside the West Gate of Hefei City with excitement. Passing through the furnace clusters, we walked toward No. 1 Blast Furnace. This thirteen-cubic-meter small modern blast furnace was the first to ignite the fire of building small modern blast furnaces in the province, paving the way and setting an example for the development of small modern blast furnaces throughout the province. As we approached the furnace, molten iron was pouring out of the furnace mouth, instantly filling the casting bed in front of the furnace. In the early stage of production of this small blast furnace, the iron output was low due to the workers' lack of operating skills. Later, as the workers' technical level continued to improve, the three shifts of workers strengthened their cooperation, and the output continued to rise. In October of last year, it maintained high production for twenty-nine consecutive days, with the highest daily output reaching more than twenty-one tons. The Hefei Municipal Metallurgical Industry Command awarded this furnace the "High-Yield Satellite" flag.

This steel plant is a steel experimental field built by the Provincial Party Committee with Party membership dues. Now, twenty small modern blast furnaces with a volume of thirteen to twenty-eight cubic meters and fourteen small steelmaking converters have been built. We remember that when No. 1 Blast Furnace was under construction and had just been put into production, large numbers of people came from all over the province every day to "learn from experience." Now, more than 1,100 small modern blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more have been built or are under construction in the province.

		"Small Modern Clusters"

We walked around the steel base outside the West Gate of Hefei City, and before we knew it, night had fallen. At night, the steel base was brilliantly lit. The red molten iron and countless electric lights clearly outlined the huge silhouette of the steel base.

We stood on a high ground here, surrounded by dense furnace clusters in all directions. The powerful sound of the blowers broke through the silence of the night. In addition to the steel plant of the Provincial Party Committee, there are also steel plants run by the Provincial Industrial and Transportation Department, the Political and Legal Department, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee, and municipal directly affiliated organs, with a total of about eighty blast furnaces.

The scene here is a microcosm of many steel bases along the Huainan Railway. We saw this scale of "small modern clusters" when we later interviewed in Bengbu, Huainan, and Wuhu. Now, these cities generally have three or four clusters, and one cluster is a steel plant. Each cluster generally has twenty or thirty blast furnaces. We saw a cluster of sixty-two in Huainan, and a cluster of fifty-two in Bengbu. The volume of the furnaces is all from eight to twenty-eight cubic meters.

However, the situation of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company is different. In addition to some small modern blast furnaces newly built last year, the main ones here are modern medium-sized blast furnaces with a volume of seventy-two to seven hundred and fifty cubic meters. Since the mass campaign to develop the iron and steel industry by the whole people, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has also been developing at a rapid pace. Five medium-sized blast furnaces built last year have been put into production, and seven medium-sized blast furnaces are under construction. Seeing these rows of modern medium-sized blast furnaces, we thought of the future of many steel bases along the Huainan Railway and on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

When talking about the benefits of small modern blast furnaces, many comrades along the way praised them. Take Wuhu City as an example. Wang Ke, the Minister of Industry and Transportation of the Wuhu Municipal Party Committee, told us that the daily output of the eight-cubic-meter small modern blast furnaces in the city is more than nine tons, and the iron output is more normal than that of small indigenous furnaces; the iron produced is all first and second-class gray cast iron; indigenous furnaces need three or four tons of coke to produce one ton of iron, while small modern blast furnaces only need one and a half tons of coke to produce one ton of iron; the labor required to produce one ton of iron is seventy-four to one hundred and forty-seven people for indigenous furnaces, while small modern furnaces only need more than twenty people. Small modern blast furnaces also require less investment and shorter construction time than large modern blast furnaces. Each small modern furnace only costs about 80,000 yuan and can be built in ten days to half a month. These small modern blast furnaces have formed clusters, which can not only use water and electricity uniformly and save cadre strength, but more importantly, create conditions for the future development of modern iron and steel joint enterprises. Everyone believes that under the current situation where the country urgently needs iron and steel, building such small modern blast furnaces is in line with the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy.

		In the Coal Mining Area

Getting off the train at Shuijiahu Station on the Huainan Railway and transferring to the train to Huainan City, it takes less than half an hour to enter the Huainan mining area. What particularly caught our attention was the rows of blast furnace chimneys that appeared between the tall mine shafts. On the railway lines in the mining area, trains run day and night, full of coal and coke going away, and full of ore returning.

This newly emerging scene marks that Huainan City's industry has developed to a new stage. Now, it not only produces coal, but also produces iron and steel. When we arrived, the city had already built and was building 157 small modern blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more. A large-scale steel plant is also under construction. The responsible comrades of Huainan City told us that building a steel plant here can use coal on the spot, and one train of coal can be transported out and one train of ore can be transported back, so the trains do not run empty in both directions.

At night, the entire mining area is like an ocean of fire. More than 30,000 coke refining troops from all over the province are vigorously engaged in indigenous coke refining methods. Walking towards a flashing light, we came to the largest coke refining site. On this coke refining site of approximately 1,000 mu, 163 coke kilns are simultaneously spitting out roaring flames. Now, Huainan City can produce more than 6,000 tons of coke every day. In addition to using part of it in the city, most of it is supplied to the needs of Ma'anshan and other places. Refining coke from coal can save a lot of transportation power. Transporting one ton of coke is equivalent to transporting two tons of coal.

The slogan "Guarantee the steel marshal has sufficient grain" has encouraged the Huainan coal mine workers to exert their soaring energy. They completed the annual coal production plan thirty-seven days ahead of schedule. The average daily output increased by more than 60% compared with 1957.

	Abundant Ore Supply Area

Now, we are again standing on the Baimashan ore field, which is high into the clouds. Here, the mountains are full of mining people. The mountain opening machines are constantly sounding, and the cars transporting ore down the mountain are running back and forth. Suddenly, a roaring explosion sounded on a mountain near us, followed by billowing smoke and tumbling boulders. An old worker happily told us that this was the "deep-hole expansion blasting method" that was successfully tested not long ago. Its power is really great. One shot can blast down several thousand tons, or even more than 12,000 tons, of ore.

Baimashan Mining Field is one of the five major mining fields in Fanchang County. Fanchang County is only more than forty kilometers away from Wuhu City, and the transportation is relatively convenient. It is the ore supply area for many steel bases on the south bank of the Yangtze River and along the Huainan Railway. In the mountains and ridges of this county, there are rich iron ore deposits. There are currently fifty-two mountain tops being mined. The iron content of the ore is all above 50%. On December 12 last year, the county overfulfilled the annual production plan of more than 1,017,000 tons of ore. (Attached picture)

    去年12月中旬，我们访问了淮南铁路沿线和长江南岸正在形成的几个钢铁基地。
    我们从合肥出发，先后访问了淮南铁路沿线的蚌埠市和淮南市，然后跨过长江，到芜湖、马鞍山和繁昌等地进行了访问。一路之上，到处炉火熊熊，铁水奔流，铁路沿线和长江南岸，宛如两条长长的钢铁巨龙。三个月以前，我们曾在沿线采访过，那时候除了小土炉在生产外，许多小洋炉才开始建设。如今情形大变，小土炉已经让位给“小洋群”了。
        第一座小洋高炉
    我们怀着兴奋的心情，参观了位于合肥市西门外的中共安徽省委办的钢铁厂。穿过炉群，我们向一号高炉走去。就是这座十三立方公尺的小洋高炉，第一个在全省点燃了兴建小洋高炉之火，为全省小洋高炉的发展开辟了道路，树立了榜样。当我们走近炉旁时，铁水正从炉口向外倾泄。那红红的铁水，瞬时就把炉前铸床灌得满满的。这座小高炉投入生产的初期，由于工人操作技术不熟练，出铁量低。后来，随着工人技术水平不断提高，三班工人加强了协作，产量就不断地上升。去年10月份还连续二十九天高产，最高日产量达到二十一吨多。合肥市冶金工业指挥部曾经奖给这座炉子“高产卫星”旗。
    这个钢铁厂是省委用党费建设起来的钢铁试验田。现在，已经建成十三立方公尺至二十八立方公尺的小洋高炉二十座，小炼钢转炉十四个。我们记得，当一号高炉正在建设和刚投入生产的时候，每天都有大批人从全省各地赶来“取经”。现在，全省八立方公尺以上的小洋高炉，已经建成和正在施工的共有一千一百多座。
            “小洋群”
    我们在合肥市西门外的钢铁基地上走来走去，不觉夜幕降临了。黑夜，钢铁基地光彩辉煌。那红红的铁水和无数的电灯，清晰地钩画出钢铁基地的庞大轮廓。
    我们站在这里的一块高地上，前后左右都被密密麻麻的高炉群包围着。鼓风机发出的强大的声浪，冲破了黑夜的沉静。这里除了有省委的钢铁厂以外，还有省工交部门、政法部门和合肥市委以及市直属机关办的钢铁厂，共有高炉约八十座。
    这里的情景，是淮南铁路沿线许多钢铁基地的缩影。我们以后在蚌埠、淮南、芜湖采访时，都看到了这种规模的“小洋群”。现在，这几个市一般都有三、四个群，一个群就是一个钢铁厂。每一群一般是二、三十座高炉，我们在淮南看到的一群是六十二座，蚌埠有一群是五十二座。炉的容积，全都是八至二十八立方公尺。
    不过，马鞍山钢铁公司的情景就不同了。除了去年新建的一些小洋高炉以外，这里主要的是七十二立方公尺至七百五十立方公尺的现代化的中型高炉。全民大办钢铁工业以来，马鞍山钢铁公司也以飞快的速度发展着。去年建成投入生产的中型高炉有五座，正在建设的中型高炉有七座。我们看到这一排排现代化的中型高炉，就想到了淮南铁路沿线和长江南岸许多钢铁基地的未来。
    谈到小洋高炉的好处，沿途许多同志都称赞不已。就以芜湖市为例吧。芜湖市委工业交通部长王克同志告诉我们，这个市八立方公尺的小洋高炉，日产量都在九吨以上，出铁比小土炉正常；炼出的铁都是一、二等的灰口铁；土炉每炼一吨铁需要三、四吨焦炭，而小洋高炉有一吨半焦就可以炼一吨铁；炼一吨铁所需要的劳力，土炉是七十四人至一百四十七人，小洋炉只要二十多个人。小洋高炉又比建设大洋高炉投资少，建设时间短。每座小洋炉只要八万元上下，十天到半个月就可以建成。这些小洋高炉成了群，不仅能够统一使用水、电，节省干部力量，更重要的是为今后发展现代化的钢铁联合企业创造了条件。大家都认为：在目前国家急需钢铁的情况下，建设这种小洋高炉是符合“多、快、好、省”方针的。
            在煤矿区
    从淮南铁路上的水家湖车站下车，转乘到淮南市的列车，不用半个小时，就进入淮南矿区了。特别引我们注目的，是在那些高大的矿井架间，出现了一排排的高炉烟囱。在矿区的铁路线上，火车日夜不停地奔驰着，满载煤和焦炭而去，又满载矿石而归。
    这种新出现的情景，标志着淮南市的工业已经发展到了一个新的阶段。现在，这里不仅生产煤，而且生产钢铁了。我们到达时，全市已经建成和正在建设的八立方公尺以上的小洋高炉有一百五十七座。一个大规模的钢铁厂，也在加紧施工。淮南市的负责同志对我们说：在这里建设钢铁厂，可以就地使用煤炭，而且运出一车煤就能运回一车矿石，火车来回都不空跑。
    夜晚，整个矿区像火的海洋。来自全省各地的三万多炼焦大军，正在大搞土法炼焦。迎着一片闪闪的火光走去，我们来到了一个最大的炼焦场地。在这大约一千亩地的炼焦场地上，一百六十三座焦窑同时吐出熊熊的火苗。现在，淮南市每天能出六千多吨焦，除本市用一部分外，大部分供应马鞍山等地的需要。就煤炼焦，可以节省很大的运输力量，运出一吨焦，就等于运出两吨煤。
    “保证钢铁元帅有充足的粮食”这一口号，鼓舞淮南煤矿的职工们发挥了冲天的干劲。他们提前三十七天完成了全年产煤计划，平均日产量，比1957年提高了60％多。
        富饶的矿石供应地
    现在，我们又置身在高入云层的白马山矿石场上了。在这里，满山都是开矿的人群，开山机不停地响着，往山下运矿石的汽车来往奔驰。突然，在我们附近的一个山头上响起了轰轰的爆破声，接着是硝烟弥漫，巨石翻滚。一位老工人高兴地告诉我们，这是不久以前试验成功的“深眼扩孔爆破法”。它的威力可真大，一炮就能炸下几千吨，甚至一万二千多吨矿石。
    白马山矿场，是繁昌县五大矿场之一。繁昌县离芜湖市不过四十多公里，交通比较方便，是长江南岸和淮南铁路沿线许多钢铁基地的矿石供应地。在这个县的崇山峻岭里，蕴藏着丰富的铁矿石。目前正在开采的就有五十二个山头。矿石的含铁量，都在50％以上。全县在去年12月12日，就超额完成了一百零一万七千多吨矿石的全年生产计划。（附图片）
