    Nine Dragon Mountain Unleashes the Long Dragon
    Lian Xiang
  A Debate Frees the Mind
    To go back a bit, in June 1958, when all the workers of the Nine Dragon Mountain Motor Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company were discussing the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the Transportation Company also presented to the workers for discussion technical measures for vigorously promoting "Five Transformations" (double-shift transportation, transportation rationalization, automobile trailerization, tool mechanization for maintenance, loading and unloading mechanization). Following this, a debate on "Can automobiles tow trailers?" unfolded. A few comrades felt uneasy about trailer transportation. Some said:
  "Our vehicles are all worn out, the traction is small, and they can't pull." Some said: "There are no braking devices on the trailers, and with a tail behind, it will sway and guarantee accidents." Some said: "It's okay to drive on flat roads, but climbing hills will be a problem." Some also worried: "It's okay to drive on the roads, but I'm afraid they won't be able to enter the gates of the freight yards and warehouses." Others feared it would easily damage parts and guarantee the rate of intactness. All sorts of reasons were put forward, but they could not refute the fact that the trailer trucks of the Tianjin Transportation Company were passing by their door every day. "If they can tow, why can't we?" The Party Committee, based on the opinions of the majority of comrades, used an "IFA" truck to tow four trailers, hauling fifteen and a half tons of bricks from Nine Dragon Mountain all the way to the Municipal Government Building to report good news to the Company Member Representative Conference that was being held. On that day, it was raining heavily, the road was slippery, and visibility was poor, but the train still climbed the slope of "Xianglai Street" at a speed of 15 to 20 kilometers per hour and entered the not-so-spacious gate of the Municipal Government Building without any accidents or damage to any parts. The debate ended in this way: the conservatives lost, the onlookers saw the living facts, and those who had doubts about towing trailers were all vying to tow trailers.
        "Persuading the Six States" Massively Develop Cooperation
    The problem of whether or not to tow trailers was solved, but the state could not allocate so many trailers for a while, so let's build them ourselves, but steel was in short supply. What to do?
    Difficulties can never stop people whose minds have been liberated. The Party Committee Secretary, the Depot Director, and several department heads discussed it together and found a solution through consultation. They thought: "Now that everyone is engaged in large-scale cooperation, things that one unit, one department, or one region cannot do alone can be done faster and better if several units, several departments, or several regions organize themselves and cooperate with each other." Subsequently, they launched a "Persuade the Six States" campaign. Several responsible cadres went to the nearby factories to publicize the contradiction between the current transportation capacity and the amount of transportation, and also told the brother factories about the difficulty they encountered in building trailers due to the shortage of steel. With the rationale explained clearly, the results were immediate. In just a few days, they received timely and enthusiastic support from brother factories and collected tons of broken steel and scrap iron. This hurdle of materials was thus overcome.
    Problems always follow one after another. With materials, there were not enough technicians, and a large number of trailers could not be built in a short time. What to do? We still have to find a solution outside the depot. They went to the Shunyi County Middle School and mobilized dozens of young and strong middle school students to come to their depot to participate in work-study programs. These lively and energetic young men learned from experienced workers and quickly became carpenters, fitters, and welders. One trailer after another was produced in their hands.
        "Add Another Trailer" Continuous Revolution
    The most active in engaging in towing was the 12th Squad of this depot. This squad was responsible for the grain supply transportation from the Eastern Suburbs Grain Depot to the Flour Mill outside Jianguomen, 7.5 million catties every day, not a catty less. In the past, to complete this 7.5 million catties of grain transportation, it required 18 trucks working all day long. After implementing one trailer per truck, each truck transported 80 tons more per day than before, and six trucks could be freed up to support transportation elsewhere.
    With people energized, the vehicles also became energized. After a period of time, the drivers felt that their "worn-out vehicles" had great potential, and generally added two trailers per truck. In this way, 7.5 million catties of grain only needed six main trucks to tow twelve trailers to complete the task.
    The more trailers were towed, the more experience was gained. Based on their experience, the drivers summarized their towing experience with the saying "Better to be slow than to stop." In the previous period, they towed less and drove fast, but when they encountered oncoming vehicles, they had to brake suddenly, which was not only unsafe but also very strenuous to start. Later, they always maintained a speed of 15 to 25 kilometers per hour, adjusting the speed according to the density of vehicles and pedestrians and the technical conditions of the road, being fast where appropriate and slow where appropriate. When encountering oncoming vehicles, they only needed to brake slightly to let them pass, greatly reducing the time spent stopping midway, and as a result, they arrived earlier than driving fast.
    If you drive a little slower, you can tow another trailer. In the end, they achieved one truck towing three trailers. With one main truck pulling three trailers, loading and unloading became a problem again. It took at least 40 minutes for four people to load 12.5 tons of goods. The time spent waiting for loading and unloading was prolonged, which was counterproductive. The new problem forced them to find new solutions.
        Cleverness Within Cleverness Infinite Potential
    What could be done to prevent the main truck from stopping? Squad Leader Ding Yuntian and the drivers working with him racked their brains for this matter. Every second counts, time is ton-kilometers. They finally defeated time and let time offer them more vehicles, which is the trailer circulating transportation method they are now promoting. They placed three trailers at each of the loading and unloading locations. Each main truck still carried three trailers, but the departure times were staggered. When the first truck arrived at the unloading location, it dropped the loaded trailers and hooked up the empty trailers; when the second and third trains arrived, they also dropped the loaded trailers and hooked up the empty trailers, and dropped the empty trailers and hooked up the loaded trailers in the same way. In this way, the main truck was always running, just like a railway locomotive, dropping one train and hooking up another, no longer having to wait in the freight yard for loading and unloading and wasting time. After adopting this method, the daily transportation volume of each truck increased from the original 38 tons to more than 100 tons; loading and unloading workers could concentrate on loading and unloading, and the number of personnel was also reduced from more than 40 to more than 20. Now, the flour mill's task of transporting 7.5 million catties of grain only requires three trucks and fifteen trailers, and can be completed in one day.
    The experience of the 12th Squad in organizing trailer circulating transportation has opened up a broad path for the national automobile transportation sector in organizing trailer transportation. It is conceivable that if all the automobile trailers in the country could organize circulating transportation like the 12th Squad, how much transportation capacity would be provided for the country and how much wealth would be created.

    九龙山放长龙

  一场辩论　思想解放
    话说得远一点，还在1958年6月，北京市运输公司九龙山汽车场全体职工，讨论党提出的建设社会主义总路线的时候，运输公司把大闹“五化”（运输双班化，运输合理化，汽车拖挂化，保修机具化，装卸机械化）的技术措施也同时交给职工讨论。随着，一场“汽车能不能拖挂”的辩论就展开了。有少数同志对拖挂运输心里老犯嘀咕。有的说：
  “咱们净破车，牵引力小，拖不起来”。有的说：“车上没有制动设备，拖上一个尾巴，东摇西晃，准保出事故”。有的说：“走平路行，爬坡有问题”。也有的说：“马路上走走行，只恐怕进不了货场仓库的大门”。还有人怕容易损坏机件，保证不了完好率。各式各样的理由都摆出来了，可是他们没有办法驳倒这样的事实：就在他们的门前，天津市运输公司的汽车挂车每天过来过去。“人家能拖，为什么我们不能拖”？党委根据大多数同志的意见，用了一辆“依发”车，拖了四个挂车，从九龙山拉了十五吨半砖，一直送到市府大楼，向正在召开的公司会员代表大会报喜。这一天，大雨滂沱，路滑、视距不清，列车仍以每小时十五至二十公里的速度，爬过了
  “象来街”的坡，进了市府大楼并不算宽敞的大门，既没有出事故，也没有损坏了什么机件。一场辩论就这样结束了：保守派输了，观望派看到了活生生的事实，那些对拖挂曾经有过怀疑的人都争着要拖挂车了。
        “游说六国”　大搞协作
    能不能拖挂的问题解决了，可是国家一时分配不下那么多的挂车，自己动手造吧，钢材又缺乏。怎么办呢？
    困难，再也难不住解放了思想的人们。党委书记、场长和几个科室负责干部一起合计了一下，务了一番虚，务出了个道理来。他们想：“如今处处都搞大协作，一个单位、一个部门、一个地区单独办不到的事情，几个单位、几个部门、几个地区组织起来，互相协作，就可以办得到，而且会办得更快更好。”随后他们就来了个“游说六国”，几个负责干部分头跑遍了附近的工厂，宣传当前运输能力和运输量之间不相适应的矛盾，把他们想造挂车遇到钢材不足的困难也告诉了兄弟工厂。道理讲清，立竿见影，仅仅在几天以内，他们就得到了兄弟工厂及时而热情的支援，搜集到了成吨的破钢废铁。材料这一关就这样闯过来了。
    问题总是一个接着一个，有了材料，技工不足，大批的挂车还是短时间内造不出来。怎么办？还得到场外去想办法。他们跑到顺义县立中学，动员了几十个年轻力壮的中学生，到他们场里来勤工俭学。这些生龙活虎的小伙子跟着老师傅学，很快就学成了木工、钳工、焊工，一辆辆的挂车，在他们的手里拿出来了。
        “再挂一个”　不断革命
    搞拖挂最积极的要算这个场的第十二小队。这个小队担负着从东郊粮库到建国门外面粉厂的粮食供应运输，每天七百五十万斤一斤不能少。以往要完成这七百五十万斤的粮食运输，需要十八部汽车整整工作一天。开始实行一车一挂后，每部车每天比以前多拉八十吨，可以挤出六部车来支援别处的运输。
    人有了劲，车也有了劲。一个时期后，司机同志感到他们的“破车”大有潜力，普遍来了个一车两挂。这样一来，七百五十万斤粮食只要六部主车拖十二个挂车就能完成任务。
    挂车越拖越多，越拖经验也越多。司机同志们根据他们的体会，用“不怕慢就怕站”这句话总结了他们的拖挂经验。前一个时期拖的少，跑得快，但一遇会车就得急刹车，既不安全，起步又很费劲。后来他们一直以每小时十五到二十五公里的速度，根据车马行人的密度、道路的技术状况，分别不同路段，该快就快，该慢就慢，遇到会车只要稍一刹车就让过去了，大大减少了中途停站时间，结果比跑快车还要到达得早。
    跑得慢一点，还可以再拖挂一个。最后他们实现了一车三挂。一部主车拉上三个挂车，装卸又成了问题。四个人装十二吨半货最少要四十分钟，汽车等装等卸的时间延长了，反而得不偿失。新的问题逼着他们非找新的办法不可。
        巧中有巧　潜力无穷
    想什么办法不让主车停下来呢？小队长丁允田和一起工作的司机为这件事绞尽了脑汁。分秒必争，时间就是吨公里。他们终于战胜了时间，让时间给他们献出了更多的车辆，这就是现在他们推行的挂车循环运输法。他们在装货和卸货的地点，一头放了三个挂车，每部主车还是带三个挂车，但把出场的时间错开，头车到了卸货地点，甩下重车，挂上空车；等到第二、第三趟列车到达时，同样也是甩重挂空，甩空挂重。这样，主车老在运行，就像铁路机车一样，甩下这一列又挂上那一列，再也不用等在货场装卸而浪费时间了。采取这个办法后，每部车的日运量从原来的三十八吨增加到一百多吨；装卸工人可以集中装卸，人员也由原来的四十多人，减少到二十多人。现在，面粉厂的七百五十万斤粮运任务，只需要三部汽车十五部挂车，工作一天就能完成了。
    十二小队组织挂车循环运输的经验，为全国汽车运输部门在组织挂车运输上开辟了一条广阔的途径。可以设想，全国的汽车挂车都能像十二小队那样组织循环运输，将为国家提供多大的运力，创造多大的财富。（附图片）
