The National Agricultural Work Conference, with tremendous drive and confidence, conducted detailed discussions, research, and preliminary arrangements for achieving an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front this year.

The conference, convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, followed the National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, which began on January 2nd. Participating in the conference were leading cadres from provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country responsible for agricultural production. The conference lasted twelve days, concluding on January 13th. The conference held comprehensive discussions and made preliminary plans for agricultural production in 1959, based on the grain and cotton production targets for 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Ten Initiatives proposed by the National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. The conference not only arranged the production of grain, cotton, oil crops, and hemp, but also discussed the further leap forward in the development of livestock, vegetables, silkworms, tea, and other productions, as well as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. Prior to discussing the production plan, the conference also made preliminary arrangements for the procurement plan of agricultural and sideline products, in order to incorporate the production of the people's communes into the national plan. In addition, the conference studied how to implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, the production policies and planning management of the people's communes, and the working methods of the agricultural departments under the new circumstances of communization.

Based on the experience of the great agricultural harvest of 1958, and with an active and reliable spirit, the conference discussed the production of the four major agricultural products of grain, cotton, oil crops, and hemp in 1959. Through calculations of cultivated land, planting area, unit yield, and labor force, the conference considered that the target of producing 1,050 billion jin of grain and 100 million dan of cotton this year was ambitious. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have all put forward preliminary planting plans and yield plans based on this target, ensuring completion and striving to exceed them. Many regions will see a leap in grain and cotton unit yields by about one-fold this year; the average grain per capita will reach about 2,000 jin; and all regions have appropriately reduced the planting area of sweet potatoes and increased the proportion of fine grains. The production of oil crops and hemp was raised to the same level as grain and cotton, expanding the planting area and striving for large-scale high yields, striving to meet the targets. The conference proposed: to manage this year's hemp fields with the spirit of managing cotton fields. According to the policy of diversified management, the conference also discussed the expansion of planting other cash crops, the great development of large livestock, and the development of breeding industries such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. In terms of developing animal husbandry, the conference proposed to vigorously organize large-scale collective breeding in the people's communes, with individual members also raising some pigs and chickens. It required each people's commune to arrange feed while arranging food and seeds. The conference proposed that animal husbandry should achieve full pregnancies in terms of breeding and full fatness in terms of fattening, striving for large-scale production. The conference also required each people's commune to make good vegetable production plans for supplying cities and for self-sufficiency, and to establish vegetable production bases according to the population each commune is responsible for supplying vegetables to.

The conference fully recognized that agriculture in 1959 is an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958, with the unit yields of rice, wheat, and other crops increasing by one-fold compared to 1958, a challenging task. However, the conference believed that under the leadership of the Party, as long as we further boost our drive, strive for the upstream, have the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, have the rich experience of the great harvest of 1958, and the conditions of water conservancy, deep plowing, and seeds are better than in 1958, the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture will be implemented more comprehensively and better, and the winter wheat, rapeseed, and other over-wintering crops are planted better than last year, laying the foundation for the first season's harvest this year. The agricultural front will surely achieve even greater victories in 1959.

During the discussion, regarding the policy of less planting and high yield, the conference unanimously agreed that it is necessary to first strive for high yield, and gradually reduce the cultivated land and sown area accordingly as the unit yield increases. This year, some regions will appropriately return to cultivation some salt-alkali wastelands, sandy wastelands, barren mountains, and other cultivated lands with extremely low yields; some provinces in the south plan to strive for high yields in one season and appropriately reduce multiple cropping; in order to concentrate labor to strive for high yields, and prepare for gradually reducing agricultural cultivated land towards large-scale landscaping. The conference believed that for the policy of less planting, high yield, more harvest, and the implementation of large-scale landscaping, we must be both active and prepared, down-to-earth, and steadily advance. Without a yield of 5,000 jin per mu, we cannot reduce the cultivated land of crops to about one-third. 1959 is still a preparation, and the cultivated land and sown area of grain crops cannot be reduced much. Cultivated land should be no less than 1.5 billion mu, the total sown area should be no less than 2.1 billion mu, the sown area of grain crops should be no less than 1.6 billion mu, and the sown area of cotton should be no less than 100 million mu. Old cotton-growing areas cannot reduce the sown area of cotton this year, and the planting area of sweet potatoes in various places should not be reduced too much. As for reducing multiple cropping, it must also be cautious. Preparations for spring-sown crops must be made early to ensure that they are planted well. Only when a great summer harvest is achieved, and early autumn crops sown in the spring are growing well, can we consider appropriately reducing the sown area of late autumn crops. Regarding diversified management and the all-round revolution of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, the conference believed that people's communes must establish the idea of diversified management. In 1959, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery must be comprehensively developed and make an all-round leap forward; not only must the output make a great leap forward, but the products must also be comprehensively utilized to increase commodity production. Only in this way can we solve the needs of market supply, increase industrial raw materials and the income of the communes. However, diversified management must also have priorities. In 1959, we must develop diversified management on the premise of first ensuring the production of grain, cotton, oil, and hemp, as well as the development of livestock. We must make comprehensive arrangements for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. Do not grasp the large and major ones and lose the small and minor ones. Commune-run industries should first develop industries such as agricultural tools and fertilizers that serve agriculture, the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products, and handicrafts, and then run other light and heavy industries.

The conference believed that rationally arranging and using labor is the key to ensuring the realization of a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959. To this end, the conference made a comprehensive calculation of the labor force required for various productions in 1959; and required all regions across the country and each people's commune to calculate the labor force account to ensure the realization of the production plan. In principle, the labor force used in agricultural production should account for half of the total rural labor force, and can be more during the busy farming season. Only in this way can we complete this year's production tasks through efforts to improve labor efficiency. However, it should not be too much, so as not to affect the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, rural industry, and welfare, culture, and health. The conference emphasized that improving labor productivity is a fundamental issue, and required all regions to pay comprehensive attention to the rational organization, arrangement, and use of labor, improve operating methods, continue to pay attention to tool reform and the realization of semi-mechanization, and strive to rapidly increase the production volume of each working day.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech at the end of the conference that the great victory achieved on the agricultural production front in 1958 was unprecedented. The absolute increase and the increase ratio of various agricultural crops are not found in historical records. Moreover, after repeated struggles and practices, in 1958 we established a complete set of production increase experiences: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management. In 1957, the observation faction and right-leaning conservative thinking attacked these eight points. In 1958, we repelled the attacks and established the eight points, and we achieved a great leap forward. We must continue this struggle in the future. We believe that as long as we conscientiously and comprehensively implement these eight production increase measures, coupled with the improvement of the management level of the people's communes, it is fully expected that an even greater harvest than in 1958 will be achieved in 1959. He further emphasized that the various indicators discussed at this conference for 1959 are another grand plan with great significance, a much more arduous task than in 1958, but the tasks of 1959 can be overfulfilled.

Regarding the conscientious and comprehensive implementation of the eight production increase measures, he pointed out: We must continue to promote the belief that man can conquer nature, and continue to build farmland water conservancy projects, but the plans should not be too large to avoid affecting quality and squeezing out other tasks. Both construction and irrigation must vigorously improve tools and operating methods, improve work efficiency, and save labor. It is very important to ensure the quality of the projects currently underway. Regarding fertilizers, he required all regions to seize the remaining one to two months of agricultural slack time to quickly launch a larger-scale shock fertilizer accumulation campaign; and required all regions to continue to develop local chemical fertilizers and formally establish factories for regular production. Regarding deep plowing, he pointed out that great achievements have been made since the autumn, and it is sufficient to carry out deep plowing on one-third of the land each year and rotate it once every three years, with a depth of about one foot, so as not to occupy too much labor. Regarding seeds, he pointed out that good seeds are an important issue. There is a certain limit to dense planting, and to further increase yields, we must select good seeds with many ears, large ears, many grains, and heavy grains. However, the main solution to good seeds depends on the establishment of good seed bases and warehouses by the people's communes in various places, and self-selection and cultivation. Regarding dense planting, he required all regions to conscientiously summarize the dense planting experience of those with yields of 1,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu, as a basis for further experimental research on the appropriate density of various crops. Regarding plant protection, he required all regions to strengthen forecasting and early warning, prepare early for frost prevention and pest control, and expand the area of radical treatment; and required all regions to vigorously manufacture local pesticides and machinery. In terms of field management, he required the people's communes to quickly restore and strengthen the responsibility system, and improve quality to achieve garden-style farming. Among the eight measures, Comrade Tan Zhenlin spoke the most about tool reform. He emphasized that agricultural machinery will still only increase slightly in 1959, and the main reliance is still on improving agricultural tools. Great achievements have been made in tool reform last year. Recently, except for some progress in water conservancy tools, there has been a standstill in other aspects. All regions must conscientiously summarize the experiences and lessons of tool reform, educate cadres and activists with concrete facts, and quickly re-launch the tool reform movement. This year, the tool reform work must move forward, and conscientiously and realistically do a good job in improving tools, adding ball bearings, and realizing semi-mechanization. In the work of tool reform, we must also strengthen scientific and technological experimental research, solve the problems of technical data supply, material supply, and repair, and conscientiously improve and earnestly help solve ideological and technical problems in the process of popularization and use. He required the people's communes, management districts, production teams, and county federations to divide the work of manufacturing; counties and communes should build factories, county factories should repair and manufacture larger and more precise tools, communes should manufacture general improved tools, and production teams should improve existing tools; counties and communes with conditions should establish ball bearing factories. He said: The tool reform movement should be improved this year. From now on, all regions must formulate annual plans and carry them out in an organized manner according to the plans, so that the task of realizing semi-mechanization is guaranteed.

After twelve days of discussion, the conference was full of drive and confidence in achieving greater victories on the agricultural front in 1959. The comrades attending the conference from provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions unanimously stated that at present, we must vigorously grasp winter production, vigorously grasp fertilizer accumulation, sideline occupations, and various preparations for spring ploughing production, especially to grasp the field management of over-wintering crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and first strive for a complete victory in winter production, a complete victory in spring ploughing, and a comprehensive great harvest in summer, to lay the foundation for a comprehensive victory on the agricultural front in 1959.

    认真全面执行八项增产措施，合理安排使用劳力
    实行少种高产方针要有准备，必须先高产后少种

    新华社18日讯　全国农业工作会议以极大的干劲和信心，对夺取今年农业战线上更大、更好、更全面的跃进，作了详细讨论、研究和初步安排。
    农业部召开的这次会议，是紧接着全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议之后，在1月2日举行的。参加会议的有全国各省、市、自治区的党或政府负责农业生产的领导干部。这次会议共开了十二天，已在13日结束。会议就中共八届六中全会所提出的1959年的粮、棉生产指标，和全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所提出的十大倡议，对1959年的农业生产作了全面讨论和初步的计划安排。会议不仅安排了粮食、棉花、油料、麻类的生产，还讨论了发展牲畜、蔬菜、蚕丝、茶叶等生产和林、牧、副、渔等方面的进一步跃进问题。在讨论生产计划前，为了把人民公社的生产纳入国家计划，会议还初步安排了农副产品的收购计划。此外，会议还研究了怎样贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，和人民公社的生产方针、计划管理，以及在公社化新的形势下农业部门的工作方法等问题。
    会议根据1958年农业大丰收的经验，以积极而又可靠的精神讨论了1959年粮食、棉花、油料、麻类四项主要农产品的生产。通过对耕地、种植面积、单位产量、劳动力等方面的计算，会议认为：今年生产粮食一万零五百亿斤、棉花一亿担的指标是积极的。各省、市、自治区都根据这个指标提出了初步的种植计划和产量计划，保证完成，力争超过。不少地区今年粮棉单位产量将跃增一倍左右；按人口平均每人粮食将达二千斤左右；而且各地都适当地略为收缩了一些薯类的种植面积，增加了细粮的比重。油料和麻类生产提到了和粮棉同等的地位，扩大了种植面积并力争大面积丰产，力争过关。会议提出：要用管理棉田的精神来管好今年的麻田。根据多种经营的方针，会议又讨论了扩大种植其他经济作物，和大大发展大牲畜，发展养牛、养马、养猪、养羊、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅、养兔等饲养业的问题。在发展畜牧业方面会议提出要大力组织人民公社的大规模集体饲养，猪、鸡等也发动社员养一部分，要求每个人民公社在安排口粮、种子时要同时安排好饲料。会议提出了今年畜牧业在繁殖上要作到满怀，肥育上要作到满膘，力争大群丰产。会议还要求每个人民公社都要作好供应城市的和自给的蔬菜生产计划，按各社所担负的供应蔬菜的人口，建立蔬菜生产基地。
    会议充分认识到：1959年的农业是一次比1958年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，稻、麦等单位产量比1958年要跃进一倍，任务艰巨。但是，会议认为，在党的领导下只要进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，有人民公社的无比优越性，有1958年大丰收的丰富经验，加上水利、深耕、种子等条件比1958年好，农业“八字宪法”将执行得更全面更好，小麦、油菜等越冬作物种得比上年好已为今年第一季丰收打下基础等等，农业战线一定能够在1959年取得更加伟大的胜利。
    讨论中，对于少种高产的方针，会议一致认为必须首先争取高产，随着单位产量提高逐步相应地收缩耕地和播种的面积。今年，若干地区将适当退耕一部分盐碱沙荒、瘠薄山地等产量极低的耕地；南方有些省区拟争取一季高产，适当收缩复种；以便集中劳力争取高产，为逐步减少农作物耕地走向大地园林化作准备。会议认为对于少种高产多收和实行大地园林化的方针既要积极又要有准备，脚踏实地，稳步前进。没有亩产五千斤的产量，就不能把农作物的耕地收缩到三分之一左右。1959年还是准备，耕地和粮食作物播种面积还不能收缩很多。耕地应不少于十五亿亩，总播种面积不少于二十一亿亩，粮食作物播种面积不少于十六亿亩，棉花播种面积不少于一亿亩。老棉区今年不能减少棉花的播种面积，各地薯类种植面积也不能收缩过多。至于收缩复种也须慎重，春播作物必须早作准备，保证种上种好，只有夏季取得了大丰收，春播的早秋作物又生长很好的情况下，才能考虑相应地减少晚秋作物的播种面积。关于多种经营，农林牧副渔五业全线大革命的问题，会议认为：人民公社必须确立多种经营的思想。1959年农林牧副渔五业必须全面发展，全面跃进；不仅产量要大跃进，而且产品要综合利用，增加商品性生产。只有这样才能解决市场供应的需要，增加工业原料和公社的收入。但是多种经营也要有轻重缓急，1959年必须在首先保证粮棉油麻生产以及发展牲畜的条件下发展多种经营，对农林牧副渔必须作全面的安排，不要抓了大宗的主要的，丢了小宗的次要的。社办工业方面首先是发展为农业服务的农具、肥料等工业，农副产品的加工业、手工业，然后才是举办其他轻重工业。
    会议认为：合理地安排使用劳动力，是保证实现1959年农业更大跃进的关键。为此，会议对1959年各项生产所需的劳动力作了通盘的计算；并要求全国各地、每个人民公社都算一算劳动力账，来保证生产计划的实现。原则上农业生产方面的用工以占农村总劳动力的一半为宜，农忙还可多些。这样才能在提高劳动效率的努力下完成今年的生产任务。但也不宜过多，影响林牧副渔、农村工业和福利、文化、卫生等事业的发展。会议强调提出：提高劳动生产率是根本问题，要求各地全面注意对劳动力的合理组织、安排和使用，改善操作方法，继续注意工具改革和实现半机械化，努力把每一个劳动日的生产量迅速提高。
    中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志在会议结束时讲话指出：1958年农业生产战线取得的伟大胜利是史无前例的，各种农作物的增产绝对数和增产比例都是历史记录上找不到的。而且经过反复的斗争和实践，1958年我们确立了水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管这一整套增产经验。1957年观潮派、右倾保守思想曾经攻击的就是这八条，1958年我们打退了攻击，确立了八条，就取得了大跃进。今后还要继续这个斗争。我们相信：只要认真地全面地执行这八条增产措施，加上人民公社经营管理水平的提高，在1959年内取得比1958年更大的丰收，是完全可以预期的。他更强调：这次会议所讨论的1959年各项指标是又一个有伟大意义的宏伟的计划，是比1958年艰巨得多的大事，但是1959年的任务是能够超额完成的。
    关于认真全面执行八项增产措施，他指出：必须继续宣传人定胜天的信念，继续兴修农田水利工程，但计划不要过大以免影响质量和挤掉其他任务。无论施工和灌溉都须大力改善工具和操作方法，提高工效节约劳力。现正进行的工程，保证质量是十分重要的。关于肥料，他要求各地抓紧尚有的一个月到两个月的农闲时间，迅速开展一个更大规模的突击积肥运动；要求各地继续发展土化肥，正式建立工厂经常生产。关于深耕，他指出去秋以来成绩很大，作到一年深耕三分之一，三年轮耕一次即可，深度一尺左右即可，以免占用劳力过大。关于种子，他指出良种是一个重要问题。密植有一定的限度，进一步提高产量要选用穗多、穗大、粒多、粒重的良种。但解决良种主要靠各地人民公社建立良种基地和仓库，自己选种和培育。关于密植，他要求各地认真总结那些亩产一千斤到三千斤的密植经验，作为进一步试验研究各种作物适当的密植程度的根据。关于植物保护，他要求各地必须加强预测预报，及早作好防霜和防治病虫害的工作，扩大根治区域；要求各地大力制造土农药械。在田间管理方面，他要求人民公社迅速恢复和加强责任制，并提高质量，作到园田化。在八项措施中，谭震林同志对工具改革讲得最多。他强调指出1959年农业机械仍然只有少量增加，主要还是依靠改良农具。去年工具改革成绩很大，最近除水利工具有些进展外，其他方面却有停顿现象。各地必须认真总结一下工具改革的经验教训，用具体事实教育干部和积极分子，迅速把工具改革运动重新发动起来。今年工具改革工作必须前进一步，脚踏实地、实事求是地把改良工具加滚珠轴承和实现半机械化的工作认真做好。在工具改革工作中还要加强科学技术的试验研究，解决技术资料供应、材料供应和修配等问题，推广使用过程中也要认真改进、认真帮助解决思想问题和技术问题。他要求各地人民公社、管理区、生产队和县联社分工制造；县和公社都要建厂，县厂修理和制造较大较精密的工具，公社制造一般改良工具，生产队改良现有工具；县和有条件的公社都建立滚珠轴承工厂。他说：工具改革运动今年应提高一步。从现在起各地就须拟出全年计划，按计划有组织地进行，实现半机械化的任务才有保证。
    经过十二天的讨论，会议对取得1959年农业战线上更大的胜利充满了干劲和信心。各省、市、自治区到会同志一致表示：当前要大抓冬季生产，大抓积肥、副业和各项春耕生产的准备工作，特别是要抓好小麦、油菜等越冬作物的田间管理，首先争取冬季生产全胜，春耕全胜和夏季的全面大丰收，为1959年农业战线的全面胜利打下基础。
