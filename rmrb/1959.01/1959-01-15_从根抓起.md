	Getting to the Root of the Matter

	Shijiazhuang is focusing on the quality of pig iron, starting with ore selection, coal washing, and coking. This is a good approach and shows foresight.

	The quality of pig iron directly determines the quality of steel and steel products, and is also related to the output and variety of steel and steel products. And the quality, output, and variety of steel products are major issues that affect the quality, output, and speed of basic construction projects and machinery equipment. To ensure a comprehensive Great Leap Forward this year, with double harvests in both quality and quantity, it is necessary to firmly grasp this "first process" from the beginning of the year. We hope that the "small native groups" and "small foreign groups" in all localities will vigorously focus on the quality of pig iron.

    从根抓起
    石家庄市抓生铁质量，而且从选矿和洗煤、炼焦抓起，抓得好，有眼力。
    生铁质量好坏，直接决定着钢和钢材的质量，也关联着钢和钢材的产量和品种。而钢材的质量、产量和品种，乃是牵涉到基本建设工程和机械设备的质量、产量、速度的大事。为了保证今年全面大跃进，质、量双丰收，及需从年初起就牢牢抓紧这“第一道工序”。我们希望，一切地方的“小土群”、“小洋群”，都猛抓一下生铁质量。
