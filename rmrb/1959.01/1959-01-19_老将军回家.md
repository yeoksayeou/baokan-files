    The Old General Returns Home
    As soon as the old general arrived at the commune, he instructed: I am going home to take a look, and I will eat with the commune members in the village canteen. Do not prepare anything.
    "Do not prepare anything," how could that be possible? We hid from the old general and secretly prepared some dishes: a bowl of tofu, a bowl of pork with vermicelli, and two bowls of local pickles. To be honest, even the most ordinary guest is treated with more than just these dishes by the farmers here. We thought, the general will surely eat such a meal. However, before we even reached the general's residence, we heard that he had gone to the canteen to eat. We hurried to the canteen and saw that the old general was already eating with everyone, and the dishes were the same as what the canteen was serving today: a bowl of radish and a bowl of cowpeas with large peppers.

    老将军回家
    老将军一到公社，就叮嘱说：我回家看看，就在湾里食堂和社员一块吃饭，一切都不要准备。
    “一切都不要准备”，这怎能行呢？我们躲着老将军的面，偷偷地做了点菜：一碗豆腐，一碗猪肉加粉条，两碗土产酱菜。照实说，这里农民招待最普通的客人，也不只准备这点菜。我们想，这样的饭菜，将军总会吃的。可是，我们还没到将军的住所，就听说他到食堂吃饭去了。我们连忙赶到食堂，只见老将军已经在食堂里和大伙儿吃起来了，菜就是食堂今天吃的菜：一碗萝卜和一碗豇豆加大椒。
