Delivering a Devastating Blow to a Devastating Disease
-- The People of Yanbei Eliminate Potato Late Blight in One Year
By Our Correspondent Yang Yi

In the Yanmen Pass area of northern Shanxi, the average yield per mu of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) has historically been only a few hundred jin. During the Great Leap Forward of 1958, this area shed its low-yield label, achieving a miraculous potato harvest. The average yield per mu across the region's one million mu of potatoes was over 2,100 jin. This great achievement, in addition to measures such as sparse planting becoming dense planting, furrow planting becoming pit planting, expanding the use of improved varieties, and increasing fertilizer application, was due in large part to the first-ever eradication of potato late blight, the potato's biggest enemy in terms of yield increase, a decisive factor in ensuring healthy potato growth.

Potatoes are a staple food for the people of Yanbei and are listed as one of the "Three Treasures"
("The Three Treasures of Yanbei: Potatoes, Naked Oats, and Leather Coats"). The farmers of Yanbei have a deep love for potatoes, but the mention of planting potatoes always brings up an indelible "worry": around July, at the height of potato growth when the plants are lush and leafy, patches of spots often appear on the leaves. Within days of their first appearance, these spots can turn large areas of green potato plants into withered, rotten, black fields, and the harvested potatoes are full of brown, hard lumps. When such a disaster strikes, the farmers are always at a loss. This, scientifically speaking, is the devastating potato disease – late blight. Potato cultivation in China has a history of nearly a hundred years, and late blight has a wide distribution. Looking at Yanbei's production records, the potato loss due to late blight in just 1953 and 1954 was equivalent to half a year's worth of grain for the entire Yanbei population. This disease has always been regarded as something impossible to prevent, and neither Chinese nor foreign scientists have developed effective control measures. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, through a vigorous mass movement, the heroic people of Yanbei broke down superstitions, created miracles, and sent away this "plague god."

Mass Experiments Uncover the Secret

The first to unlock the secret of preventing potato late blight and create the miracle of its elimination was the Nanhebao Agricultural Cooperative in Tianzhen County (now merged into Yanggao County). Back in July 1954, late blight was rampant in the Nanhebao area, and entire fields of potato seedlings withered and died in less than ten days. However, two patches of robust, green potato seedlings remained there. When it came time to dig up the potatoes, these two patches stood out even more, producing not only more but also better quality potatoes. These were the experimental plots conducted by the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the help of technical personnel, to prevent late blight in agricultural cooperatives. They conducted a total of five experiments on the experimental plots. After comparison, all had varying degrees of effectiveness in preventing late blight: vernalization and sun-drying of seeds increased production by more than 40% compared to no vernalization and sun-drying; cold storage increased production by 13% compared to hot storage; selecting and transferring improved varieties (local varieties) increased production by 37%; spraying pesticides increased production compared to not spraying; and early planting was also beneficial for preventing late blight. People initially explored a comprehensive new method for the prevention and control of late blight.

Everything is Attributed to Putting Politics in Command

The fact that the people of Yanbei solved the century-old problem of preventing late blight in one year of the Great Leap Forward is the result of daring to think, daring to act, and conducting scientific analysis. On the one hand, the Yanbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China educated cadres and farmers to establish a spirit of despising difficulties and to engage in this struggle with soaring enthusiasm; on the other hand, it organized personnel to investigate and study, analyze the laws of late blight occurrence, so that prevention and control work was orderly, down-to-earth, and targeted.

Yanbei started conducting typical experiments in 1954, and although it had explored some preliminary experiences, it had not been able to promote them comprehensively. The reason was that many cadres and farmers had a fluke mentality, hoping that the climatic conditions would not be conducive to the occurrence and development of late blight and hoping that late blight would self-destruct. In the spring of 1958, disputes arose again over the issue of late blight. One group advocated trying to control and eliminate it; the other group was intimidated by late blight in spirit, compromised to difficulties, and proposed reducing the potato planting area. The Prefectural Committee raised the issue of late blight at an enlarged meeting and launched a major ideological exchange. Then, a mass airing of views, a great debate was organized among party members and the masses throughout the region, strengthening the confidence and determination of leaders and the masses to overcome late blight.

At the same time, through the summary of past prevention and control experience, the Prefectural Committee further analyzed and pointed out: although late blight is rapidly infectious and repeatedly infectious, first, due to natural conditions, late blight pathogens can only parasitize on potato tubers. As long as diseased seed potatoes are eliminated, the occurrence can be prevented. Second, according to several years of observation, diseased potatoes do not develop simultaneously after sowing. The earliest outbreaks that form central diseased plants do not exceed 5% of all plants. Controlling central diseased plants can prevent the spread. Third, take prompt measures using the time required for the repeated infection cycle of pathogens after the onset of disease (generally four or five days). Through this realistic and scientific analysis, the vast number of cadres and the masses understood the laws of late blight occurrence and greatly enhanced their confidence in overcoming the disease.

Mass Movement Opens Up New Horizons

The method of eliminating late blight in the Yanbei area is to engage in mass movements. Prevention and control tasks and drugs and machinery were all fixed to production teams. With the meteorological station and agricultural experiment station as the center, agricultural cooperatives were absorbed to form an information network. In order to unify action, unified headquarters were established between counties for mutual assistance and support. At the same time, the method of "training soldiers in battle" was adopted to train technical personnel, and then campaigns were continuously organized according to the various stages of late blight occurrence and development.

The first was after the occurrence of central diseased plants, immediately launched a "everyone scouts, plant by plant inspection" movement to check for central diseased plants. The slogan was: "Inspect while checking, discover while checking, eliminate while checking, eliminate where it is discovered." 280,000 people in the region participated in this campaign, and timely handling was achieved in the 10,000 mu of cultivated land where late blight central diseased plants were found.

The second started on July 23. As central diseased plants continued to occur and begin to infect, the region organized a labor force of 500,000 people to fight against central diseased plants again. In the struggle, the masses created tactics of on-site elimination and layer-by-layer blockade. After discovering central diseased plants, measures such as removing diseased leaves or cutting and burying seedlings were taken, and then Bordeaux mixture was sprayed within 50 meters around the diseased plants, and copper sulfate water was sprayed within two or three li in the outer perimeter for layer-by-layer blockade. During this campaign, the original 10,000 mu of diseased plants were annihilated within ten days.

In early August, late blight appeared with a third infection peak, and a third campaign involving 580,000 people was launched throughout the region. This campaign was the most intense stage of the entire movement. People worked in shifts, and the machinery did not stop, day and night to encircle and annihilate late blight. In addition to blockading and surrounding affected plots, agents were also universally sprayed on potato fields. This peak of infection was suppressed again by the masses.

After three campaigns, the three outbreaks of late blight were contained, and the spread was basically controlled. However, in order to prevent all previous efforts from being wasted, in mid-August, the region organized 240,000 people to carry out a mopping-up battle, and another spraying protection was carried out on 700,000 mu of area. In this way, the Yanbei potato producing area safely passed the late blight occurrence period, ended the history of Yanbei being harmed by late blight, and cleared the way for healthy and high-yielding potatoes.

    给毁灭性病害以毁灭性打击
    ——雁北人民一年消灭了山药蛋晚疫病
    本报记者　杨义
    山西雁门关以北地区，在历史上山药蛋（马铃薯）的平均亩产量总是几百斤。在大跃进的1958年中，一跃而摘掉低产的帽子，出现了山药蛋大丰收的奇迹。全区一百万亩山药蛋平均亩产二千一百多斤。这项巨大成就的取得，除了与稀植变密植、犁种改窝种、扩大良种、增施肥料等措施有关外，首次歼灭山药蛋增产的最大敌人——晚疫病，是保证山药蛋健康生长的决定性因素。
    山药蛋是雁北人民的主食，被列为三宝之一
  （“雁北三件宝，山药、莜麦、大皮袄”）。雁北农民对山药蛋如此爱好，但是提起种山药蛋来却有一块消失不了的“心病”。就是每当7月天，山药蛋生长正枝盛叶茂的时刻，往往在叶面上发生一片一片的斑点，这种东西从开始发现起，几天之内就能使大面积绿油油的山药蛋株叶变成枯枝烂叶漆黑一片，收下的山药蛋满是褐色硬块。每当这种灾难降临的时候，农民们总是束手无策。这就是在科学上说的山药蛋毁灭性的病害——晚疫病。我国栽培山药蛋的历史近一百年，晚疫病流行范围也较广。打开雁北生产纪录看，仅1953、1954两年晚疫病危害损失的山药蛋就等于全雁北人民半年的口粮。这种病害过去一直是被人们看作是无办法防治的东西，中、外科学界都没有研究出好的防治措施。1958年大跃进中经过大搞群众运动，英雄的雁北人民打破了迷信，创造了奇迹，送走了这个“瘟神”。
  群众试验揭开了谜底
    首先打开防治山药蛋晚疫病秘密、创造消灭晚疫病奇迹的是天镇县（现并入阳高县）南河堡农业社。还是在1954年7月，南河堡一带晚疫病大流行，山药蛋苗一块接一块不到十天工夫就全枯死了。但是就在这里，却保留下两块茁壮翠绿的山药苗。到刨山药蛋的时候，这两块地更出类拔萃，不仅产的多而且质量好。这就是中共雁北地委组织技术人员帮助农业社进行的防治晚疫病试验地。他们在试验地共进行了五项试验，经过对照，对防治晚疫病都有不同程度的成效：春化晒种比不春化晒种的增产40％多；冷窖贮藏的比热窖贮藏的增产13％；选调良种的（当地品种）增产37％；喷药的比不喷药的增产；而且早种比迟种对防治晚疫病也有利。人们初步摸索到了一套全面综合防治晚疫病的新办法。
    一切归功于政治挂帅
    雁北人民一年大跃进解决了一百年来防治晚疫病的难题，是敢想敢做和进行科学分析的结晶。中共雁北地委一方面教育干部和农民树立藐视困难的气魄，以冲天的干劲进行这项斗争；另一方面组织人员调查研究，分析晚疫病发生的规律，使防治工作有条有理，脚踏实地，有的放矢。
    雁北自1954年着手进行典型试验，虽然摸索到了一些初步经验，但一直未能全面推广。原因是有许多干部、农民存在一种侥幸心理，他们幻想着气候条件不利于晚疫病的发生和发展，期望着晚疫病自生自灭。1958年春季在晚疫病问题上又发生了争论。一种人主张努力控制它，消灭它；另一种人则在精神上被晚疫病吓倒了，向困难妥协，提出要缩小山药蛋种植面积。地委在扩大会议上把晚疫病问题提出来展开了一次思想大交锋。接着又在全区党员和群众中组织大鸣大放大辩论，从领导到群众坚定了战胜晚疫病的信心和决心。
    与此同时，地委通过历年防治经验的总结，进一步分析指出：晚疫病虽然侵染迅速还要重复感染，但是，一、由于自然条件限制，晚疫病病菌实际上只能在山药蛋块茎上寄生，只要消灭了带病种薯，就可以杜绝发生；二、根据几年的观察，病薯播种后不是同时并发，最先发病形成中心病株的不超过全部植株的5％，控制住中心病株就可以制止蔓延；三、发病后利用病菌重复侵染周期所需要的时间（一般是四、五天），迅速采取措施。经过这种实事求是的科学分析，使广大干部和群众懂得了晚疫病发生的规律，大大增强了战胜病害的信心。
    群众运动开辟新天地
    雁北地区消灭晚疫病的办法是大搞群众运动。防治任务和药械都固定到生产队。以气象台、农业试验站为中心，吸收农业社组成情报网。为了行动统一，县与县建立统一指挥部互助协作支援。同时采取“阵地练兵”的方法训练技术人员，然后按照晚疫病发生和发展的各个阶段，连续组织战役。
    第一次是中心病株发生以后，立即开展了
  “人人侦察，株株检查”的查中心病株运动。口号是：“边检查、边发现、边消灭，发现在哪里，消灭在哪里”。全区有二十八万人投入这次战役，在发现有晚疫病中心病株的一万余亩耕地面积上，作到了及时处理。
    第二次是从7月23日开始，由于中心病株继续发生并开始侵染，全区组织了五十万人的劳动大军再次向中心病株斗争。在斗争中群众创造了就地消灭、层层封锁的战术。发现中心病株后，采取摘除病叶或者割秧深埋的办法，然后在病株周围五十公尺内喷打波尔多液，在外围二、三里内喷打硫酸铜水，进行层层封锁。这次战役中使原来的一万多亩发病植株在十天内就受到歼击。
    8月上旬晚疫病又出现了第三次侵染高峰，随着全区又掀起了五十八万人参加的第三次战役。这次战役是整个运动最紧张的阶段。人换班，械不停，昼夜围歼晚疫病，除对发病地块封锁包围外，并在山药蛋地普遍喷打了药剂。这一次的侵染高峰又被群众压了下去。
    经过三次战役，制住了晚疫病三次突起，基本上控制了蔓延，但为了防止功亏一篑，接着8月中旬全区又组织二十四万多人开展了一次扫残战斗，在七十万亩面积上，又进行了一次喷药防护。这样雁北山药蛋产区安全地渡过了晚疫病发生时期，结束了雁北受晚疫病危害的历史，为山药蛋健康、高产扫清了道路。
