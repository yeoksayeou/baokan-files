Cadres Returning from Labor at Renmin University Show Renewed Vigor in Work and Thought.
(Our newspaper’s dispatch) Reporter Sun Shikai reports: More than 400 cadres from Renmin University, after a year of labor at the outskirts of Beijing, have returned to their work posts with a bountiful harvest of both labor and thought. In the two months since their return to the university, new atmospheres have emerged in their work, ideology, and style.
These cadres, who were sent down from this university, were among the first group of personnel from Beijing universities to participate in labor training last year. Among them were associate professors, lecturers, young teaching assistants, and administrative staff. Through the practice of productive labor and grassroots work, they all felt that their perceptual knowledge had become richer than in the past, abstract knowledge had become concrete, and partial understanding had become more comprehensive, while some erroneous thoughts had also been corrected. Some lecturers and teaching assistants in the Philosophy Department, during their labor in the countryside, took peasants as their teachers and gradually learned to use the simple and clear language of the peasants, combined with the current practical work issues in the countryside, to expound the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. They saw the urgency of cadres and commune members in the people's communes to learn philosophy in their labor and life, and wrote philosophy textbooks for peasants after productive labor. A lecturer in the Philosophy Department, who returned from labor and resumed teaching, said with emotion: "I have been teaching philosophy for several years, and I always felt that it was principles plus examples. This time, I worked and studied with the peasants, and I saw that the peasants were learning philosophy by discussing the abstract with the concrete, learning for practical application, which gave me great inspiration." Many teachers from departments and teaching and research sections, after returning from labor, successively went to factories and rural areas to conduct investigations and research and participate in practical work. Associate Professor Tang Rang of the Statistics Department deeply felt during his labor training that theory must be linked to practice in order to do a good job in teaching. Shortly after returning to the university, he went to Anyang, Henan Province, to conduct rural surveys, so that he could teach with both theory and practice in the next semester. Some lecturers and teaching assistants in the Chinese Language and Literature teaching and research sections, after spending this labor life with workers and peasants, further realized the principle of using the past for the present in literature. Some teachers volunteered to go to the countryside to promote Mandarin Chinese, exploring teaching experience from practice.
These cadres who had been sent down have brought the revolutionary vigor and hard-working, plain living style of the countryside back to the university, making various tasks more active. Among the thirteen people who frequently work in the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section, nine are cadres who have returned from being sent down. A lecturer who rarely cared about work in the past now often encourages himself with the Great Leap Forward spirit of the working people and is busy proofreading over 200,000 words of translated teaching materials all day long without feeling tired. Some lecturers and teaching assistants used to not care about politics, let alone do administrative work, fearing that it would affect their "academic research." Now, they have realized from labor practice that this is due to the prevalence of individualism. After returning to the university, in addition to teaching, they also voluntarily asked to do more social work to train themselves. Many cadres who returned to the university are taking the hard-working and simple style of workers and peasants as their example. Dai Yun, the deputy head of the catering section, studied the methods of the rural experimental field work and, after returning to the university, went deep into a cafeteria, worked with the cooks, and jointly studied how to improve the meals. The cooks praised him saying, "Comrade Dai Yun is really energetic, and his style has also changed." Duan Cuixian, who originally worked in the Archives Department, set up a nursery in the countryside after being sent down and was rated as a model nursery worker. Originally, she was uneasy about staying at the university as a senior archivist after graduating from the graduate class of this university, always thinking that it was a waste of talent. After returning from the countryside this time, she immediately wrote to the personnel department of the school, expressing her firm obedience to the organization's assignment. When Wu Puyue, a lecturer in the Statistics Department, was assigned to work in a newly built university in Qinghai Province after returning from being sent down, she excitedly told the university, "The Party has cultivated me, and after a year of labor training, I can overcome any difficulties." Before leaving Beijing, she made a special trip to Nanpingzhuang, the place where she had labored, to see the villagers, and the villagers also sent the production captain to bring them the fruits of their joint labor—peanuts—to see her off.
Some cadres from this university still maintain frequent contact with the rural areas where they labored after returning. Some people take a Sunday to run back to the People's Commune to see the villagers and the land they have cultivated with their own hands, and some people often exchange letters with the commune to care for and greet each other. At the same time, some peasants also come to the university as guests to visit the partners with whom they lived and labored.

    劳动锻炼的鲜花在工作岗位结果
    人民大学下放归来干部工作、思想焕然一新
    本报讯　记者孙世恺报道：中国人民大学四百多个下放干部在北京郊区经过一年的劳动锻炼后，带着劳动思想双丰收的硕果回到了工作岗位。他们在回校后的两个多月中，工作和思想作风等各方面都出现了新气象。
    这个学校的下放干部是去年北京高等学校下放劳动锻炼较早的一批人，其中有副教授、讲师、青年助教和行政人员。经过生产劳动和基层工作的实践，他们都觉得感性认识比过去丰富了，抽象的认识具体了，片面的认识比较全面了，有些错误思想也得到纠正。哲学系一些讲师、助教在农村劳动中，拜农民为师，逐渐学会用通俗明快的农民语言结合当前农村实际工作中的问题，阐述马列主义哲学的基本原理。他们在劳动生活中看到人民公社的干部和社员要求学哲学的迫切性，便在生产劳动后为农民编写出哲学课本。哲学系有个下放回来，重新走上教学岗位的讲师很感慨地说：自己教了几年哲学，总感到是原则加例子，这回跟农民一起劳动一起学习，看到农民学哲学是以实论虚，学以致用，给自己的启发很大。许多系和教研室的教员下放回来，又陆续到工厂、农村作调查研究和参加实际工作。统计系副教授唐壤在劳动锻炼中深深感到理论一定要联系实际，才能搞好教学工作，这次他回到学校不久，便到河南省安阳去作农村调查，以便下学期能够有理论又有实际地进行教学。汉语和文学两个教研室的一些讲师、助教和工农群众共同度过这段劳动生活后，更进一步认识到文学的古为今用的道理。有的教员自愿到农村去推广普通话，从实践中摸索教学经验。
    这些下放干部，把农村的革命干劲和艰苦朴素的作风带回到学校，使各项工作更加活跃了。俄文教研室现在经常参加工作的十三个人中，有九个是下放回来的干部。过去对工作很少关心的一个讲师，现在经常以劳动人民的大跃进来鼓励自己，整天忙着核对二十多万字的翻译教材，也不觉得劳累。有些讲师、助教过去不问政治、更不愿作行政工作，生怕影响了他们的“学术研究”。现在从劳动实践中认识到这是个人主义作祟，回到学校后除担任教学工作外，还自动要求多作些社会工作，来锻炼自己。许多回校的下放干部都以工农群众的艰苦朴素作风作为自己的榜样。伙食课副课长戴匀学习农村种试验田的工作方法，回校后便深入一个食堂，和炊事员一起干活，共同研究改进伙食。炊事员们都称赞说，戴匀同志的干劲真足，作风也变了。原先在档案系工作的段翠先下放后在农村办起托儿所，曾被评为模范保育员。原来她在本校研究生班毕业后留校作高级资料员都不安心，总认为是大材小用。这次从农村回来后，立即向学校的人事部门写信，表示坚决服从组织分配。统计系讲师吴浦月下放回来后被分配到青海省的新建院校工作时，她兴奋地向学校表示：“党培养我，下放锻炼一年，有什么困难我也能克服。”她在离开北京前，特意跑到她劳动过的地方——南平庄去看望乡亲，老乡们也派生产队长带着他们共同劳动的果实——花生来为她送行。
    这个学校有些下放干部回来后，仍然和他们劳动过的农村保持经常联系。有人抽个星期天跑回人民公社里看看乡亲以及亲手耕种过的土地，也有人和社里经常书信来往，彼此关怀问候。同时，有些农民也来到学校作客，看望和他们一起生活劳动过的伙伴。
