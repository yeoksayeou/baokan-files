    The Suffering of the "Sweetest Country"
    ——How US Monopoly Capital Controls Cuba's Economic Life
    Yang Xiling
    The Cuban people's anti-dictatorial struggle has been victorious! On January 21st, a mass anti-American demonstration of one million people—one-sixth of the country's population—was held in Havana, the capital of Cuba. At the mass rally, Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro announced: "Cuba not only demands political freedom, but also economic freedom." He said that Cuba would "revise and abolish" the "various privileges granted to foreign enterprises" by the former Batista dictatorial government. The victory of the Cuban people and their determination to defend the fruits of their victory has greatly alarmed US imperialism, which enjoys special economic rights in Cuba. The January 23rd issue of "U.S. News & World Report" quite blatantly reflected this attitude. This mouthpiece of Wall Street wrote that "a ten billion dollar American business group may be in real trouble," and it also cited comments from so-called "American labor experts" stating that the Cuban workers' struggle against American monopoly enterprises "may have serious consequences for Americans doing business in Cuba."

    Why is it that just when people all over the world are rejoicing over the victory of the Cuban people, US imperialism is so disturbed and uneasy? It is not difficult to find the answer in the blood-related political and economic relationship between the United States and the Batista regime.

    US Financial Groups Invade a Beautiful Island
    Located at the intersection of two routes from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from South America to North America is the long, narrow island of Cuba. It is the largest island in the Caribbean archipelago, with an area of 114,500 square kilometers and a population of approximately six million. Cuba is located north of Florida in the United States, only 300 kilometers away. Cuba has fertile land, an excellent climate, and picturesque scenery. When Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, he called it "the most beautiful place humans have ever seen."

    The main productive activity of the Cuban people is agriculture. 42% of the working people are engaged in this occupation. The main agricultural product is sugar cane, and the main sugar-producing areas are in the four provinces of Oriente, Camagüey, Matanzas, and Las Villas. Cuba's sugar production and exports rank first in the world. Sugar production accounts for 90% of the national income, and sugar exports account for 85% of the country's total exports. That is why Cuba is also known as the "sweetest country." Cuba is also rich in tobacco and coffee. Havana cigars are world-renowned. Cuba's natural resources are also abundant. Its iron ore reserves rank fourth in the world, and other reserves such as oil, manganese, nickel, copper, and other minerals are also plentiful.

    However, these rich resources do not belong to their rightful owners—the Cuban people—but were first controlled by Spanish colonialists and then taken over by US imperialism.

    Cuba gained independence in 1901, but at that time the US military was still occupying Cuba. Under the pressure of US imperialism, the Cuban Constitutional Convention was forced to add the so-called "Platt Amendment" to the constitution in 1901, limiting Cuba's sovereignty. Article 3 gave the United States the "right" to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. This "amendment" was not abolished until 1934 under popular pressure. In 1903, the United States forced Cuba to sign a humiliating trade agreement and forced the Cuban government to lease naval bases (including Guantanamo) to the United States. For half a century, in order to obtain the greatest profits, US monopoly capital has used various despicable means, such as interfering in internal affairs and supporting pro-American regimes, to carry out cruel exploitation in Cuba.

    Batista Was a Tool of the US
    The Batista regime, supported by US monopoly capital, provided even more convenient conditions for US monopoly capital to plunder Cuba after taking power in 1952. In 1957, the Batista government promulgated a decree exempting US capitalists from taxes on remitting profits. In 1958, Batista signed another decree, which actually allowed foreign companies (mainly US companies, of course) to manage enterprises operating in Cuba, and their profits, dividends, funds, and excess profits would not be taxed. Two hundred US companies manipulated the economic lifeline of Cuba through the services of the Batista regime. The unprecedented activity of American monopoly enterprises during Batista's reign is due to this.

    Cuba is a relatively small island nation. Its area ranks thirteenth among the twenty-one countries in Latin America, but it ranks third in US direct investment in Latin American countries, totaling more than one billion US dollars, half of which was invested during Batista's rule. US monopoly capital has carried out shocking plunder of Cuba, robbing it of 750 million US dollars in wealth in the last five years alone. US monopoly capital controls the sugar industry, which is the foundation of Cuba's economy. 42% of Cuba's sugarcane comes directly from US-owned plantations, and the rest also belongs to US sugar factories. Since the United States is almost the only market for Cuban sugar, it manipulates Cuban sugar prices and stipulates sugar import quotas.

    US monopoly organizations are also Cuba's largest exporter and re-exporter. Not all the sugar exported to the United States is consumed in the United States. Most of it is resold by US monopoly organizations to Europe and Asia, especially to countries that receive "US aid," at high prices. But "U.S. News & World Report" even shamelessly said after the Cuban people overthrew the dictatorial regime: "Cuba must have the United States."

    The Rockefeller financial group's New York Schroeder Bank controls two large sugar companies in Cuba, covering 450,000 acres – "Manati Sugar Company" and "Francisco Sugar Company". The "United Fruit Company," one of the ten largest US companies, controlled by the Boston financial group and the Morgan Group, also owns huge sugar factories and plantations on the island of Cuba. Some of the largest sugar companies, such as Cuba Atlantic Sugar Company, Punta Alegre Sugar Company, Central Violet Sugar Company, and West Indies Sugar Company, are all US capital, and they extract profits equivalent to 30% to 500% of their investment every year. These American companies are like green devils, extending their claws into the coast and deep inland of the island of Cuba. They are the "state within a state" in Cuba. They run their own hotels, their own shops, power plants, radio stations, and have telegraph equipment and their own docks.

    Other sectors of the Cuban economy, such as electricity, transportation, mining, aviation, and telephony, are also controlled by US monopoly capital. Cuba's iron ore is controlled by US Bethlehem Steel Company, nickel ore is monopolized by US Reynolds Metals Company and Freeport Sulphur Company, oil is controlled by New Jersey Mobil Oil Company and Texas Company. Texas Company has more than two hundred gas stations throughout Cuba; US Foreign and Domestic Electric Company controls all of Cuba's electricity; US International Telegraph and Telephone Company has invested 20 million US dollars through Cuban Telephone Company. These American companies' businesses are supported by the US government. The US military base in Guantanamo also plays a role in protecting these various devils.

    The Cuban People Live in Suffering
    Everywhere in Cuban cities, there are signs of American companies and American trust banks, as well as brightly colored American film advertisements. The shelves in stores are almost entirely filled with American goods, and Cuba's national industry is ruthlessly strangled. In Cuba, Americans have their own banks, newspapers, radio stations, schools, clubs, and churches. The American financial magnate DuPont even has his private airport. It is the same in the countryside. The rice and canned goods on the table, the farmers' clothes, and even the scythes used to cut sugarcane all bear the mark "Made in USA."

    The Cuban people are trapped in the net woven by US monopoly capital. In the "sweetest country," they live the bitterest lives.

    Dependence on the US market has deepened Cuba's economic crisis. After 1952, Cuba's sugar and tobacco production was greatly hindered due to restrictions of international agreements that maintained monopoly prices. Cuba's sugar production in 1958 dropped from seven million tons in 1952 to five million six hundred thousand tons. In this situation, out of Cuba's six million people, there are often 650,000 unemployed. In addition, the work in sugarcane fields and sugar factories is seasonal, so sugar workers only have four to six months of work a year. Even if there is work, it is arduous and subject to various cruel exploitations. In 1953, Batista even stipulated that the wages of sugar workers should be determined by the rise and fall of the average price of sugar. This has greatly reduced the living standards of workers, because wages depend on the constantly falling sugar price manipulated by the United States, rather than on the cost of living. In 1955, the wages of Cuban sugar workers were reduced by 7.3% compared to 1954 based on the sugar price.

    Under the dual oppression of US monopoly capital and local landlords, the situation of Cuban farmers is getting worse year by year. Millions of farmers have no land and can only rent land from Americans and local landlords to cultivate under the most harsh and enslaving conditions. For example, in Oriente Province, foreigners occupy 87% of all sugarcane land, of which the "United Fruit Company" and the Cuban-American Joint Refining Company alone occupy 72%. 70% of the most fertile land in the country belongs to landlords who do not cultivate the land, while farmers who own their own land account for less than 16% of all farmers.

    Under the enslavement of US imperialism and its running dogs, the living standards of the Cuban people are very low and they are extremely poor. The average life expectancy of Cubans is only about thirty-two years. Cuba also has one of the highest infant mortality rates and tuberculosis mortality rates in Latin America. Among residents under the age of fifteen, there are 820,000 illiterates, and 40% of the rural population is illiterate.

    The Cuban people clearly see that all their disasters come from one root cause—US imperialism and the dictatorial regime it supports. Therefore, it is completely understandable that they expressed great anger at the interference of US imperialism after overthrowing the Batista dictatorial government.

    In the past, someone in Cuba said, "Without the United States, not even a small leaf on the island of Cuba would dare to shake." Now, the Cuban people have stood up and want to be their own masters. They are firmly moving towards the road of independence, freedom, and democracy, and no force can stop their progress.

    “最甜的国家”的苦难
    ——美国垄断资本控制古巴的经济生活
    杨锡玲
    古巴人民的反独裁斗争胜利了；1月21日，古巴首都哈瓦那举行了一百万人——占全国人口六分之一的群众反美大示威。在群众大会上，古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗宣布：“古巴不但要求政治上的自由，而且也要求经济上的自由”。他说：古巴将“修改和废除”前巴蒂斯塔独裁政府“给予外国企业的各种特权”。古巴人民的胜利和他们保卫胜利果实的决心，使得在古巴享有特殊经济权益的美帝国主义大为恐慌。1月23日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”就相当露骨地反映了这种态度，这家华尔街的喉舌写道，“十亿美元的美国企业集团可能会遭到真正的麻烦”，它还引证所谓“美国劳工专家”的评论，说明古巴工人对美国垄断企业进行的斗争“对在古巴做买卖的美国人所造成的后果可能是严重的”。
    为什么正当全世界人民都为古巴人民的胜利而欢欣鼓舞的时候，美帝国主义却如此惶恐不安呢？人们不难从美国和巴蒂斯塔政权血肉相连的政治和经济关系中找到答案。
    美国财阀侵入美丽的岛
    在从大西洋到太平洋和从南美洲到北美洲两条航路的交叉点上，座落着狭长的古巴岛。它是加勒比群岛中最大的一个岛，面积共十一万四千五百平方公里，人口约六百万。古巴北边是美国的佛罗里达州，相距仅三百公里。古巴土地肥沃，气候优良，风景如画。1492年哥伦布发现古巴的时候，称它为“人类从未见过的美丽的地方”。
    古巴人民主要的生产活动是农业，42％的劳动人民从事这种工作，主要农产品是甘蔗，主要产糖区在奥连特、卡马圭、马坦萨斯和拉斯维利亚斯四个省。古巴的糖产量和输出量均占世界第一位，糖产量占国民收入的90％，糖的出口占全国出口总值的85％。古巴所以也被人称为“最甜的国家”。古巴也盛产烟草和咖啡，哈瓦那雪茄烟就驰名全球。古巴的自然资源也很富饶，它的铁矿砂储藏量占世界第四位，其他如石油、锰、镍、铜和其他矿物储藏也不少。
    但是，这样富庶的资源并没有属于它的合法的主人——古巴人民，而是先受制于西班牙殖民主义者，继而又掌握在美帝国主义的手里。
    古巴是在1901年独立的，当时美国军队还占领着古巴。在美帝国主义的压力下，古巴制宪会议在1901年被迫在宪法中加入所谓“普拉特修正案”，限制了古巴的主权。它的第三条使美国有干涉古巴内政的“权利”，这个“修正案”一直到1934年才在人民的压力下被废除。1903年，美国又强迫古巴签订奴役性的贸易协定，并且迫使古巴政府把海军基地（包括关塔那摩）租给美国。半个世纪以来，美国垄断资本为了获取最大的利润，使用了种种卑劣手段，通过如干涉内政、扶植亲美政权等手法在古巴进行了残酷的剥削。
    巴蒂斯塔是美国工具
    美国垄断资本扶植的巴蒂斯塔政权从1952年上台后，为美国垄断资本掠夺古巴提供了较前更为便利的条件。1957年巴蒂斯塔政府颁布一道法令，豁免美国资本家汇出利润的捐税；1958年，巴蒂斯塔又签署另一法令，竟允许外国公司（当然主要是美国公司）可以管理在古巴所经营的企业，而且它们所获得的利润、红利、资金和超额利润都不必纳税。二百家美国公司就是通过巴蒂斯塔政权的效劳操纵了古巴的经济命脉。美国垄断企业在巴蒂斯塔掌权时期空前活跃，原因也在这里。
    古巴是一个比较小的岛国，它的面积在拉丁美洲二十一国中占第十三位，但是它在美国对拉丁美洲各国的直接投资中却占第三位，总额达十亿美元以上，而其中半数是在巴蒂斯塔执政时投入的。美国垄断资本对古巴进行了惊人的掠夺，仅在最近五年内就劫走了七亿五千万美元的财富。美国垄断资本控制了作为古巴经济基础的制糖业，古巴的甘蔗有42％直接来自美国持有的种植园，其余的也归美国制糖厂；由于美国几乎是古巴糖的唯一市场，所以它操纵了古巴的糖价并规定糖的入口定额。
    美国垄断组织又是古巴最大的出口商和再出口商，输出到美国的糖并不是全部都在美国消费掉，其中大部分是被美国垄断组织以高价转销给欧亚二洲，特别是那些接受“美援”的国家。但是“美国新闻与世界报道”甚至在古巴人民推翻独裁政权后还无耻地说：“古巴必须要有美国”。
    美国的洛克菲勒财团的纽约施罗德银行控制了古巴两个占地四十五万英亩的大糖业公司——“马纳提糖业公司”和“弗兰西斯科糖业公司”。美国国外十大企业之一的由波士顿财团和摩根集团所控制的“联合果品公司”在古巴岛上也拥有庞大的制糖厂和种植园。一些最大的制糖公司，如古巴大西洋糖公司，普恩塔阿格拉糖公司，中央维奥莱特糖公司，西印度群岛糖公司等都是美国资本，而且每年要榨取到相当于投资的30％到500％的利润。这些美国公司都像绿色魔鬼一样把魔爪伸入古巴岛屿沿岸和内地深处。它们是古巴的“国中之国”。它们开办着自己的旅馆、自己的商店、电力厂、广播电台和拥有电报设备以及自己的码头。
    古巴的其他经济部门如电力、交通运输、采矿、航空业和电话业也都为美国垄断资本所控制。古巴的铁矿为美国伯利恒钢铁公司所控制，镍矿为美国雷诺金属公司和弗里波特硫磺公司所垄断，石油是掌握在新泽西美孚油公司和得克萨斯公司之手，得克萨斯公司在古巴全国就有二百多个加油站；美国国内外电力公司控制了古巴全部电力；美国的国际电报电话公司通过古巴电话公司投资达二千万美元。这些美国公司的企业都得到美国政府的支持，在关塔那摩的美国军事基地也起了保护这些各色魔鬼的作用。
    古巴人民在苦难中生活
    在古巴城市里，到处是美国公司和美国信托银行的招牌以及鲜艳耀眼的美国电影广告。商店的货架上几乎全是美国货，古巴的民族工业受到无情的扼杀。在古巴，美国人有他们自己的银行、报纸、广播电台、学校、俱乐部和教堂。美国财阀杜邦甚至有他私人的飞机场。在农村里也一样，饭桌上的大米和罐头，农民的衣服，甚至割甘蔗用的镰刀，上面都有“美国制”的标记。
    古巴人民陷入美国垄断资本编织的罗网里，在“最甜的国家”里，他们过着最苦的生活。
    对美国市场的依附加深了古巴的经济危机。1952年以后，由于保持垄断价格的国际协定的限制，古巴糖和烟草的生产受到很大阻碍，古巴的糖产量1958年从1952年的七百万吨下降到五百六十万吨。在这种情况下，古巴六百万人口中经常有六十五万失业者，加以甘蔗园和制糖厂的工作都是季节性的，因而一年中糖业工人只有四到六个月的工作。即使有工作做也是劳苦不堪，每日工作时间很长，而且要受种种残酷的剥削。1953年，巴蒂斯塔竟规定糖业工人的工资需要根据糖的平均价格涨落而定。这就使得工人生活水平大大下降，因为工资要决定于在美国操纵下不断低落的糖价，而不是根据生活费用。1955年古巴糖业工人的工资根据糖价就比1954年降低了7.3％。
    在美国垄断资本和当地大地主的双重压迫下，古巴农民的处境一年比一年恶劣。千千万万农民没有土地，只能依照最苛刻的奴役条件向美国人和当地大地主租田来耕种。例如，在奥连特省，外国人共占有全部甘蔗耕地的87％，其中单只“联合果品公司”和古巴美国联营炼糖公司就霸占了72％。全国70％最肥沃的土地属于不种地的大地主所有，而自己占有土地的农民在全体农民中还不到16％。
    在美帝国主义及其走狗的奴役下，古巴人民生活水平非常低下，贫苦万分。古巴人的平均寿命只有三十二岁左右。古巴也是拉丁美洲婴儿死亡率及结核病死亡率最高的国家之一。在十五岁以下的居民中间，文盲有八十二万人，40％的农村人口目不识丁。
    古巴人民清楚地看到，他们的所有灾难都来自一个根源——美帝国主义和它扶植起来的独裁政权。因此他们在推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁政府之后对美帝国主义的干涉表示出极大的愤怒是完全可以理解的。
    从前，古巴有人说过，“如果没有美国，古巴岛上连一片小树叶都不敢抖动一下”。现在，古巴人民站起来了，要当家作主了。他们坚定地朝着独立、自由和民主的道路前进，任何势力也阻挡不住他们的脚步。
