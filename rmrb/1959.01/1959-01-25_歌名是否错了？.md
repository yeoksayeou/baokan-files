    Is the Song Title Wrong?

    In the January 12th issue, page 8, Comrade Wang Jing's article "Labor Songs and 'Sturgeon'" discussed how a singer changed his thoughts and feelings through labor practice, which is a good article. However, is the example of the song "Sturgeon" correct? Because the article mentions that this singer is good at singing Schubert's works, and there is a famous song by Schubert called "Trout". I wonder if Comrade Wang Jing is referring to this? Trout are two or three feet long and very lively; sturgeon are a very large fish. The lively melody described in the article seems closer to "Trout".

    The reader's opinion is correct, "Sturgeon" is indeed a mistake for "Trout."　 Deputy Editor

    歌名是否错了？
    1月12日八版上王静同志写的“劳动号子与‘鲟鱼’”，谈到一个歌唱家通过劳动锻炼改变了思想感情，是一篇不错的文章。但里面举出歌曲“鲟鱼”的例子，是否错了？因为文中说这位歌唱家擅长演唱舒伯特的作品，舒伯特所作的著名的歌曲中倒有一首叫“鳟鱼”的，不知王静同志是否指此？鳟鱼长二三尺，性活泼；鲟鱼是一种很大的鱼。文中描写那种活泼的旋律，似乎近于“鳟鱼”。

    读者的意见是对的，“鲟鱼”确是“鳟鱼”之误。　副刊编者
