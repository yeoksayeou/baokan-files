    Paving the Way for the Intellectualization of the Working People
    The Flourishing Development of Education in the Shucha People's Commune

    According to a report in the Anhui Daily, the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County is vigorously developing education, popularizing cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge among the broad masses of commune members, and paving the way for the intellectualization of the working people.

    On the basis of basically completing the task of eliminating illiteracy, the commune quickly established various types of schools. Now, the entire commune has 55 various types of spare-time schools, 451 cultural study classes; one secondary art school and one agricultural technical school, both offering half-work, half-study programs; three agricultural middle schools; as well as one full-time ordinary middle school, seventeen public primary schools, thirty-four people-run primary schools, three kindergartens, and thirty-four nursery classes.

    After the establishment of the Shucha People's Commune, the broad masses of commune members more urgently demanded to learn cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge. Based on this objective situation, the commune Party committee firmly grasped various favorable conditions, strengthened school management, assigned a secretary to be in charge of cultural and educational work, established a Culture and Education Section, and transferred six Party committee members to serve as school principals. The Party branch secretaries and main cadres of each production brigade also paid attention to leading cultural and educational work.

    In the early stage of running schools, a few cadres had insufficient ideological understanding of relying on the masses to run schools. They said, "With the great leap forward in production, who has the manpower and time to run education?" Some even believed that "peasants with muddy legs can't run schools well, and even if they do, they won't last long," and were afraid to lead the masses in running schools. Among the masses, there were also thoughts of fearing not being able to learn well or learn at all. In response to this situation, the commune Party committee held a series of meetings throughout the commune to discuss the Party's educational policy, and launched a debate among cadres and the masses on "whether or not to run schools, whether it is possible to run them, and how to run them well." During the debate, they analyzed the situation and presented specific conditions, thereby criticizing various erroneous views, greatly liberating their thinking, and breaking down superstitions. As a result, various types of schools were quickly established.

    In resolving the issue of school equipment, in addition to the unified arrangements made by the commune, issues such as school buildings, desks, and chairs, and funding were resolved by relying on the masses. The source of teachers for the schools was also resolved by taking materials locally and using those with abilities as teachers. Generally, the Party committee secretary and members were responsible for teaching political classes, production experts taught technical classes, and those with higher cultural knowledge taught cultural classes.

    The main forms of schooling in the Shucha People's Commune are two: one is the development of spare-time education from cultural classes to various types of spare-time schools, and the other is the development of school education from kindergartens and primary schools to middle schools. Every production team and every factory and farm in the entire commune runs a school, and schools also run factories and farms. At present, production teams all have primary schools, cultural classes, and spare-time schools, and all factories and farms also have their own schools.

    Various technical schools and spare-time schools all advance politically, culturally, and technically in parallel, implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. They generally adopt the method of "unified political education, separate classes for cultural learning, and separate industries for technical learning" for teaching. According to the political tasks and central work requirements of each period, various forms of political and ideological education are carried out, such as combining with relevant meetings, unified reporting and discussion, as well as classroom lectures and reading newspapers and periodicals. In terms of cultural knowledge teaching, due to the different levels of cultural literacy of each person, the method of separate classes is adopted. In terms of technical learning, specialized courses are set up according to the characteristics of various types of schools to cultivate technical talents in various fields and meet the needs of the technical revolution.

    Due to the different nature of various types of schools, the time allocated for study and labor is also different, generally in three forms: one is ordinary middle schools and senior primary schools that focus on learning, mainly learning various subjects, while participating in a certain amount of labor each week and listing it as a formal course; the other is half-work, half-study schools that focus on labor, such as agricultural technical schools and agricultural middle schools, where they study for two to three hours in the morning and two to three hours in the evening (including doing homework), and have five to six hours of labor production during the day. The third is various types of spare-time schools, which mainly use spare time such as early mornings and evenings, production gaps, and before and after meetings for teaching, ensuring two hours a day. Because the study time is arranged properly, there is no delay in both production and learning, and the enthusiasm of the masses for learning is very high, with very few absences.

    The commune's efforts in education have greatly promoted the technical revolution and are conducive to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Many schools have established scientific research groups, universally engaged in experimental fields, and carried out scientific research. In the past month or so, they have created 45 kinds of advanced tools and promoted their use.

    At present, the commune Party committee plans to focus on consolidating and improving schools and cultivating and improving teachers' work in the winter, and improve the quality of education through inspection and evaluation, and promotion of experience.

    为劳动人民知识化铺设道路
    舒茶人民公社教育事业蓬勃发展
    据安徽日报消息　舒城县舒茶人民公社大办教育，把文化和科学技术知识普及到广大社员中去，为劳动人民知识化铺设了道路。
    这个公社在基本上完成扫除文盲任务的基础上，迅速办起了各种类型的学校。现在，全社有各种业余学校五十五所，文化学习班四百五十一个；有半工半读的中等艺术学校一所，农业技术学校一所，农业中学三所；还有全日制的普通中学一所，公立小学十七所，民办小学三十四所，三个幼儿园和三十四个幼儿班。
    舒茶人民公社成立以后，广大社员更加要求迫切学习文化和科学技术知识。公社党委根据这种客观形势，紧紧地抓住各种有利条件，加强办学工作，确定一位书记专管文教工作，设立文教科，并调派六名党委委员担任学校校长，各生产大队党支部书记和主要干部也都注意领导文教工作。
    办学初期，有少数干部对依靠群众办学，在思想上认识不足。他们说“生产大跃进，那有人手和时间办教育”，有人甚至认为“泥巴腿子办不好学校，办起来也不会长”，不敢领导群众办学；在群众中也有怕学不好、学不会的思想。根据这种情况，社党委就在全社召开一系列会议进行讨论党的教育方针，并在干部群众中开展了“要不要办学，能不能办，如何办好”的辩论，在辩论中分析形势，摆具体条件，从而批判了各种错误看法，大大解放了思想，破除了迷信。因此，各类学校迅速地开办起来。
    在解决办学的设备时，除了公社统一安排外，校舍、桌凳、经费等问题都是依靠群众解决的。学校的师资来源，也是本着就地取材，能者为师的办法解决的，一般是党委书记和委员负责教政治课，生产能手教技术课，文化知识高一些的人教文化课。
    舒茶人民公社办学形式主要有两种，一种是发展从文化班到各类业余学校的业余教育，另一种是发展幼儿园、小学到中学的学校教育。全社每一个生产队和每一个工厂、农场都办学校，而学校又办工厂和农场。目前，生产队都有小学、文化班和业余学校，所有工厂、农场也都有自己的学校。
    各类技术学校和业余学校都是政治、文化、技术齐头并进，贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。一般采取“统一教政治，分班学文化，分业学技术”的办法，进行教学。根据各个时期的政治任务和中心工作的要求，采取结合有关会议，统一报告讨论，以及课堂讲课、阅读报刊等多种形式进行政治思想教育。在文化知识教学方面，由于各人的文化程度不一样，就采取分班上课的办法；在学习技术方面则是根据各类学校的特点分设专业课，以培养各方面的技术人才，适应技术革命的需要。
    由于各类学校的性质不一样，安排学习与劳动的时间也不一样，大体上有这样三种：一种以学习为主的普通中学和高小，主要是学习各科知识，同时每周参加一定时间的劳动，并把它列为正式课程；另一种是以劳动为主的半工半读学校，如农业技术学校和农业中学，在上午学习二至三小时，晚上学习二至三小时（包括做作业），白天有五至六小时的时间进行劳动生产。再一种是各类业余学校，主要是利用早晚和生产空隙、会议前后等业余时间进行教学，每天保证有二小时。由于学习时间安排得当，生产与学习两不误，群众学习的积极性都很高，缺课现象很少。
    这个公社办教育，大大地推动了技术革命，有利于工农业生产大跃进。许多学校都成立了科学研究小组，普遍搞试验田，进行科学研究。最近一个多月来，已创造先进工具达四十五种，并推广使用。
    目前，公社党委打算在冬季重点抓整顿巩固学校、培养与提高教师的工作，通过检查评比，推广经验，以提高教育质量。
