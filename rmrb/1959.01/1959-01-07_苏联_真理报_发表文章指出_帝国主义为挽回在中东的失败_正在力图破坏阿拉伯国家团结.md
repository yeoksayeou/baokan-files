Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th -- TASS -- The "Pravda" newspaper of the Soviet Union today published an article stating that the colonialists are attempting to undermine the freedom and independence of Arab nations from within.

The article points out that American reactionary newspapers, under the command of powerful groups in the United States, have recently intensified their provocative propaganda against the Republic of Iraq. American newspapers stubbornly insist that Iraq is facing a so-called "communist threat."

"Pravda" draws people's attention to the fact that the propaganda against Iraq has intensified after the visit of American Assistant Secretary of State Rountree to the capitals of Arab countries. The newspaper continues by writing that, in order to salvage their failures, imperialists are now adopting new tactics. Their main objective in the Near East now is to undermine the unity of the people of the Near East in their struggle for national independence, prevent them from receiving external support, create internal disputes within Arab countries, and use some of them against others. This is the old policy of colonial empires.

The newspaper then writes that the Arab public has already seen that American imperialists, under the guise of anti-communist clamor, are attempting to revive the bankrupt Baghdad Pact by signing bilateral military treaties, and one of the purposes of such treaties is to oppose Arab countries.

The newspaper points out that the new conspiracy of the imperialists to destroy the Arab people's will to strengthen unity will inevitably encounter a resolute rebuff.

    苏联“真理报”发表文章指出
    帝国主义为挽回在中东的失败
    正在力图破坏阿拉伯国家团结
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天发表文章说，殖民主义者企图从内部破坏阿拉伯国家的自由和独立。
    文章指出，美国反动报纸奉美国有势力集团之命，最近加强了对伊拉克共和国的挑衅宣传。美国报纸硬说伊拉克面临所谓“共产主义威胁”。
      “真理报”提请人们注意，反对伊拉克的宣传，是在美国助理国务卿朗特里访问阿拉伯各国首都以后加紧起来的。报纸接着写道，帝国主义者为了挽回他们的失败，现在正在采取新的策略。现在他们在近东的主要目的是破坏近东各国人民在争取民族独立斗争中的团结，不让他们得到外来的支持，在阿拉伯国家内部制造纠纷，利用他们当中的一些人来反对另一些人。这是殖民帝国的老牌政策。
    报纸接着写道，阿拉伯公众已经看到，美帝国主义者企图在反共叫嚣的掩饰下，通过签订双边军事条约的办法来复活已经破产的巴格达条约，而这种条约的目的之一是为了反对阿拉伯各国。
    报纸指出，帝国主义者要摧毁阿拉伯人民加强团结的意志的新阴谋必将遭到坚决的反击。
