    Angry Condemnation
    Editor's Note: In recent days, we have received many letters from readers expressing their indignation and protest against the crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam in massacring patriots and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea in selling the people as slaves. We have selected two of them below:

    The People of the World Cannot Forgive the Murderous Criminals
    Our entire group of comrades felt immense anger upon hearing the news that the South Vietnamese authorities had massacred more than 1,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. We resolutely protest against the South Vietnamese authorities' inhuman and bloody crimes.
    The South Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly violated the armistice agreement and the Geneva Accords, and under the direction of U.S. imperialism, they have intensified their brutal killing of patriots, fully exposing the ugly face of a dying paper tiger. Such frenzied atrocities cannot but arouse greater anger from the people of the world. Peace-loving and just people will never forgive such crimes.
    In order to save the thousands of other political prisoners in concentration camps, we demand that the International Commission immediately take action and adopt emergency measures to stop this bloody atrocity.
    We fully support the patriotic actions of the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national reunification, and we protest against the heinous crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism.
    U.S. imperialists, get out of South Vietnam, get out of Taiwan!
                The Entire Expert Working Group of the Institute of Water Conservancy Science
    No Inhuman Trafficking Allowed
    When I saw the "People's Daily" publish the news that the Syngman Rhee clique was conducting one of the world's most肮脏transactions—human trafficking, I felt extreme indignation. I want to use our newspaper to protest the shameless deeds of these scum.
    For many years, the American bandits and the scum of the Korean nation, the Syngman Rhee clique, have colluded with each other to carry out cruel rule and frantic exploitation of the Korean people, pushing half of Korea into the abyss of hunger and poverty. The crimes they have committed against the Korean people and the people of the world cannot be washed away even with the water of the entire Pacific Ocean. Now, they are once again carrying out shameless persecution against the dying people, selling them as slaves to foreign countries. It is truly outrageous.
    I want to shout loudly: People of the world who love peace, come and sanction this inhuman human trafficking. South Korea is the Korea of the Korean people, just as Taiwan is the Taiwan of the Chinese people. The world's culprit, U.S. imperialism, must get out of South Korea!

    愤怒的谴责
    编者按　连日以来我们收到了许多读者来信，对于南越吴庭艳集团屠杀爱国者和南朝鲜李承晚集团把人民当奴隶出卖的罪恶行为表示愤慨和抗议，我们选载其中两封如下：
    全世界人民不能饶恕杀人凶手
    我们全组同志听到了南越当局大规模屠杀富利集中营一千多名爱国人士的消息后，感到无比的愤怒。我们坚决抗议南越当局这种灭绝人性的血腥罪行。
    南越当局一再破坏停战协定和日内瓦协议，而且在美帝国主义指使下更变本加厉地残暴杀害爱国人士，这充分暴露了垂死的纸老虎的丑恶面貌。这种疯狂的兽行，不能不激起全世界人民更大的愤怒。爱好和平与正义的人民绝不会饶恕这种罪行。
    为了拯救集中营里另外几千名政治犯，我们要求国际委员会立即行动起来，采取紧急措施，制止这种血腥暴行。
    我们完全支持越南人民为祖国统一而斗争的爱国行为，我们抗议美帝国主义者的走狗吴庭艳集团的滔天罪行。
    美帝国主义者滚出南越，滚出台湾去！
                水利科学研究院专家工作组全体同志
    不许进行灭绝人性的人口买卖
    当我看到“人民日报”刊登李承晚集团正在进行一笔世界上最肮脏的交易——贩卖人口的消息后，我感到极大愤慨。我要通过我们的报纸，抗议这些败类的无耻勾当。
    多年来，美国强盗和朝鲜民族的败类李承晚集团狼狈为奸，对朝鲜人民进行残酷的统治与疯狂的压榨，把半个朝鲜推向饥饿与贫困的深渊。它们对朝鲜人民、世界人民所犯下的罪恶，就是用整个太平洋的水也洗不净其万一。如今，竟又再一次向奄奄一息的人们进行无耻的迫害，把他们当奴隶出卖给外国。真是令人发指。
    我要大声呼吁：全世界爱好和平的人们都来制裁这种灭绝人性的人口贩卖。南朝鲜是朝鲜人民的朝鲜，正如台湾是中国人民的台湾一样，世界的罪魁美帝国主义必须从南朝鲜滚出去！
