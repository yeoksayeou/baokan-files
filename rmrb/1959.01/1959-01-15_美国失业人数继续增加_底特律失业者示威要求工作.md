Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Detroit News: Over 1,500 unemployed workers demonstrated in front of the Detroit City Council building on the 12th, demanding jobs. The demonstration lasted for nearly two hours.

　　This demonstration was organized at the initiative of the Detroit Unemployed Committee. Demonstrators held up placards with slogans such as "Eliminate the deadly, blood-sucking system," "It is not our fault that crises arise, why should we suffer?" "We demand jobs, we don't want subsidies."

　　Representatives of the unemployed submitted their demands to the Detroit City Council members. An unemployed representative, a Black man named Smith who formerly worked at the Chrysler automobile factory, pointed out that the unemployed are living in extreme poverty, many are deeply in debt, and many are homeless. He said that the unemployment benefits of 245,000 unemployed workers in Michigan had expired in 1958.

　　It is reported that the average monthly unemployment in Michigan (the state where Detroit, the largest automobile industry center in the United States, is located) reached 406,000 in 1958, accounting for 13% of the state's total labor force, more than double the monthly average in 1957. Among them, the number of unemployed auto workers was 295,000, 100,000 more than in 1957. In addition, there are tens of thousands of workers in the state who work less than six days a week.

　　Among the unemployed workers, the situation of Black workers is even more tragic, as they suffer from the dual blows of economic crisis and racial discrimination. For example, in 1958, 70% of the workers who lost their unemployment benefits were Black workers.

　　Xinhua News Agency: The U.S. Department of Labor announced on the 13th that the number of employed people in the United States is decreasing and the number of unemployed people is increasing. In December of last year, the number of employed people decreased by a total of 680,000; the number of unemployed people increased by 275,000, reaching a total of 4,100,800.

　　Prior to this, U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell had said that job opportunities will remain scarce in early 1959, and the number of unemployed will continue to rise in January and February.

　　Some government economists say that in the coming months, the number of unemployed may rise to the same high level as at the beginning of last year, reaching 5 million again.

    美国失业人数继续增加
    底特律失业者示威要求工作
    新华社14日讯　底特律消息：一千五百多名失业者12日在底特律市议会大厦前举行了示威游行，要求得到工作。游行持续了近两小时。
    这次示威游行是在底特律市失业者委员会的倡议下组织的。示威者高举着标语牌，上面写着“消灭制人死命的、榨取血汗的制度”，“产生危机并不是我们的过错，为什么我们应该受害？”“我们要求工作，我们不要补助金”。
    失业者代表把自己的要求提交给底特律市议会议员。一位失业者代表、从前在克莱斯勒汽车工厂工作的黑人史密斯指出，失业者正过着非常贫困的生活，许多人已负债累累，许多人流离失所。他说，密执安州有二十四万五千名的失业者的领取失业补助金的期限已在1958年满期了。
    据报道，密执安州（美国最大汽车工业中心底特律所在的州）的失业人数在1958年平均每月达四十万六千人，占这个州整个劳动力总数的13％，比1957年每月平均数多一倍。其中汽车工人的失业人数有二十九万五千人，比1957年多十万人。除此之外，在这个州里还有成千上万的工人每周工作不到六天。
    在失业的工人中，黑人工人的遭遇更为悲惨，他们受到经济危机和种族歧视的双重打击。例如，在1958年中丧失了领取失业补助的工人中，有70％是黑人工人。
    新华社讯：美国劳工部13日宣布，美国就业人数正在减少，失业人数正在增加。在去年12月份，就业人数一共减少了六十八万人；失业人数增加了二十七万五千人，总数达到四百一十万零八千人。
    在这以前，美国劳工部长密契尔曾经说，1959年初就业机会仍然很少，失业人数在1月份2月份将继续上升。
    政府的一些经济学家们说，在将来的几个月中失业人数可能上升到同去年年初一样高的数字，再达五百万。
