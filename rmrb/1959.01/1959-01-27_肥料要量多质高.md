Short Commentary

    Fertilizer should be plentiful and of high quality
    A new situation has emerged on China's agricultural front this year: the irrigated area has been significantly expanded, deep plowing and close planting measures are being implemented more and more universally, and improved varieties are being promoted on a large scale... Striving for an even greater leap forward in agricultural production this year compared to last year is entirely possible.
    The new situation also brings new demands. That is, the quantity and quality of fertilizer must be adapted to these new circumstances. For example, densely planted crops must be supplied with sufficient quantities of high-quality fertilizer that can quickly exert its effect at every "checkpoint" in their growth and development in order to guarantee a large increase in production. In field management, people often have to engage in blitz campaigns to eliminate so-called "third-class seedlings," and the most important measure to eliminate "third-class seedlings" is always the application of quick-acting fertilizer. We have all seen how weak and emaciated seedlings, once they receive the urgently needed good fertilizer, quickly turn from yellow to green and are "upgraded" from the status of "third-class seedlings." Without a sufficient quantity of good quality fertilizer, there is no guarantee of balanced crop development and growth. This is a well-known experience.
    However, while ensuring quantity, paying attention to improving fertilizer quality has special significance. In terms of the quantity of fertilizer, the amount applied last year already exceeded any year in history, and even more will be needed this year. On the one hand, we should see that the sources of fertilizer are abundant and constantly produced, and therefore inexhaustible. But on the other hand, we should also see that in some places, the river mud and pond mud have indeed been dug up relatively thoroughly in the fertilizer accumulation campaign over the past year or two, and the foundations of walls and the bottoms of stoves have also been cleaned out relatively thoroughly. Therefore, these sources of fertilizer may not be as plentiful as in the past. Under these circumstances, in order to ensure this year's fertilizer needs, in addition to making every effort to increase the quantity, improving the quality is particularly important. If one pound of fertilizer can have the effect of one and a half or even two pounds of fertilizer, the fertilizer supply can be guaranteed more effectively.
    From the perspective of transporting and applying fertilizer, this requires a lot of labor. In the past, some places spent a lot of effort accumulating mountains of soil fertilizer, but sometimes because of insufficient manpower and transportation tools, it could not be transported to the fields in time, which affected production increase. This is very regrettable. If we improve the quality of fertilizer accumulation and production and the proportion of fine fertilizer, and use less fertilizer to achieve a greater fertilizer effect, we can greatly reduce the labor used in accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer. Under the current circumstances where various aspects of production and construction require a large amount of labor, doing so is of great significance.
    Now, the mass movement of accumulating and producing fertilizer is developing more and more vigorously. Agricultural departments and people's communes in various places should do a good job in publicity, so that the broad masses of people know the importance and benefits of improving fertilizer quality, and do not neglect improving fertilizer quality because of the rush to accumulate and produce fertilizer. The people's communes should, according to the different needs of various types of farmland and crops, generally determine the quality standards of various fertilizers, and determine the proportion of coarse fertilizer and fine fertilizer, organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer, and mobilize the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer in a planned way. At the same time, the people's communes should actively consolidate and replenish the local chemical fertilizer plants established last year, and establish a batch of new fertilizer factories as needed, specifically responsible for manufacturing local chemical fertilizers and other higher quality fertilizers. To improve fertilizer quality, we must also pay attention to the methods of accumulating and producing fertilizer. Various farm fertilizers accumulated in rural areas, if given appropriate processing and correct treatment, such as improving the composting method, heating it to fully ferment and decompose, can further improve fertilizer efficiency. Conversely, if handled improperly, the fertilizer efficiency will not be great, and so on. It can be seen that widely imparting technology in the fertilizer accumulation and production movement is also one of the keys to improving fertilizer quality.
    Fertilizer work is a major event in current production. Leading organs and people's communes in various places should conduct in-depth inspections, grasping both quantity and quality, to ensure that the task of accumulating and producing fertilizer is completed in a down-to-earth manner.

### 肥料要量多质高

    肥料要量多质高
    今年我国农业战线上出现了一个更新的局面：灌溉面积显著地扩大了，深耕和密植的措施越来越普遍地实行了，优良品种在很大的范围内推广了……。争取今年农业生产比去年有一个更大的跃进，这是完全可以作到的。
    新的情况也带来了新的要求。这就是肥料的数量和质量必须与这些新情况相适应。比如密植的庄稼，必须在它们生长发育的各个“关口”，及时供给足量的、质量高的、能够迅速发挥肥效的肥料，才能保证大量增产。在田间管理上，人们常常要突击作战，消灭所谓“三类苗”，而消灭“三类苗”的最重要的措施总离不了速效肥料。我们都曾看到，瘦弱不堪的小苗一经得到急需的良好肥料，很快就由黄转青，由“三类苗”的地位“升级”了。没有数量足够、质量良好的肥料，庄稼平衡发育成长就没有保证。这是人所共知的经验。
    但是，在保证数量的同时，注意提高肥料质量，还有特殊的意义。从肥料的数量来看，去年施用肥料之多已经超过了历史上任何一年，而今年还需要比去年更多。我们一方面应当看到，肥源是丰富的，是不断产生的，因而是挖不尽的。但是，另一方面也应当看到：一两年来在积肥运动中，有些地方的河泥、塘泥的确已经挖得比较彻底了，墙基、炕底也掏得比较干净了。因此，这些方面的肥源可能不如过去多。在这种情况下，为了保证今年的肥料需要，除了还要千方百计增加数量而外，提高质量就特别重要。如果能用一斤肥料顶一斤半甚至二斤肥料的肥效，就可以更有效地保证肥料供应了。
    从运肥和施肥来看，这方面需要劳动力很多。过去有些地方花很大力气积了堆积如山的土肥，有时因为人力和运输工具不足，不能及时运到田里去，以致影响了增产，这是很可惜的。如果提高积肥造肥的质量和细肥的比重，用较少的肥料顶更多的肥效。这样，就可以大大减少在积肥、运肥、施肥方面所使用的劳动力。在目前各方面生产建设都需要大量劳动力的情况下，这样做是具有重要意义的。
    现在，群众性的积肥造肥运动正日益猛烈地开展起来，各地农业部门和人民公社应该作好宣传工作，让广大群众都知道提高肥料质量的重要和好处，不要因为突击积肥造肥而忽视了提高肥料质量。人民公社应该根据各类农田和作物的不同需要，大体上定出各种肥料的质量标准，定出粗肥和细肥、有机肥和无机肥的比重，发动群众有计划地积肥、造肥。同时，人民公社要积极整顿和充实去年建立起来的土化肥厂，并根据需要建立一批新的肥料工厂，专门负责造土化肥和其他质量更高的肥料。要提高肥料质量，还得讲究积肥造肥的方法。农村积聚起来的各种农家肥料，如果再给以适当的加工和正确的处理，比如改进堆肥方法，加热使其充分发酵，腐熟，就可以进一步提高肥效。相反，如果处理不当，肥效就不大，等等。由此可见，在积肥造肥运动中广泛传授技术，也是提高肥料质量的关键之一。
    肥料工作是当前生产上一件大事，各地领导机关和人民公社都应当深入地检查，既抓数量，更要抓质量，保证踏踏实实地完成积肥造肥任务。
