An Important Link to Ensure Engineering Quality
Beijing Fourth Construction Company Actively Trains Workers

    (Our report) Beijing Fourth Construction Company is vigorously carrying out technical education among workers according to the needs of construction. Now a group of workers has improved their technical level, which has played a good role in ensuring and improving the quality of projects.
    With the development of the capital's production and construction undertakings, the company's construction tasks have also increased sharply, so a group of new workers was added last year. The technical level of these new workers is relatively low. The construction tasks undertaken by the company are a batch of buildings with relatively high quality and artistic standards, and many old workers also feel that their skills are unfamiliar and construction is difficult. There is a big contradiction between the quality requirements and the technical level.
    In order to solve this problem, the company's Party committee actively took measures to train workers. The fifth construction site in Xidan originally had only two relatively skilled welders, which was far from meeting the construction needs. They transferred new workers for training. The old workers explained the basic principles of welding technology and guided practical operation.
    After two batches of training, forty-four people have been trained. Thanks to the patient education of the old workers and the active study of the new workers, half of the workers trained in the first batch have now reached the operating level of third and fourth-grade workers.
    Another method for the company to train workers is to let a few people experiment first, summarize experience at any time, and then teach it to more workers to achieve the purpose of generally improving the technical level. In November last year, when the weather was not too cold, they transferred some workers and technical cadres from various construction sites to Harbin, where the climate was very cold, to conduct “cold work” tests for winter decoration projects. After a period of exploration, successful experience was gained in decoration work such as plastering walls and ceilings. After this group of people came back, they taught the techniques to all plasterers.
    In this way, the company quickly enabled all workers to initially master advanced decoration techniques under winter construction conditions. Now, various construction sites are carrying out experimental operations such as exterior plastering, facing bricks, and ax-cut stones.

    保证工程质量的重要环节
    北京第四建筑公司积极培训工人
    本报讯　北京市第四建筑公司根据施工需要，在工人中大力开展技术教育。现在有一批工人已经提高了技术水平，对于保证和提高工程质量起了良好的作用。
    随着首都生产建设事业的发展，这个公司担负的建筑任务也急剧增加，因此在去年曾增添了一批新工人。这批新工人的技术水平比较低。这个公司承担的建筑任务又是一批质量、艺术水平要求比较高的建筑物，不少老工人也感到技术生疏、施工吃力，质量上的要求和技术水平之间存在着很大的矛盾。
    为了解决这个问题，这个公司的党委积极采取措施培训工人。西单第五工地原来只有两个比较熟练的电焊工人，远远不能满足施工需要，他们就抽调新工人进行训练。由老工人讲解电焊技术的基本原理，并且指导实际操作。
    经过两批训练，现在已经训练出四十四人。由于老工人的耐心教育和新工人的积极钻研，第一批训练出来的工人中有一半现在已经达到了三、四级工的操作水平。
    这个公司培训工人的另一个办法，是先由少数人实验操作，随时总结经验，然后传授给更多的工人，达到普遍提高技术水平的目的。他们在去年11月天气还不太冷时，就从各工地抽调了部分工人和技术干部，到气候很冷的哈尔滨进行冬季装修工程的
  “冷作”试验。经过一段摸索，取得了立墙抹灰和顶棚抹灰等装修活的成功经验。这一批人回来以后，在所有抹灰工中传授技术。
    这样，这个公司很快就使全体工人初步掌握了在冬季施工条件下的高级装修技术。现在，各工地正在开展外粉刷贴面砖、斧剁石等实验操作活动。
