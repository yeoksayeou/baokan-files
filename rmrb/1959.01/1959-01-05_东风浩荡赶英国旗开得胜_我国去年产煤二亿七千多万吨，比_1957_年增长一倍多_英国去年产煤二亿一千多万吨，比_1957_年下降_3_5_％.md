Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Our correspondent reports: As the people of the whole country jubilantly celebrate the New Year, an exciting piece of good news has come from the coal industry front: In 1958, China's coal production had far surpassed that of Britain.

According to our correspondent, who learned from the Ministry of Coal Industry: By 24:00 on December 31, 1958, the total raw coal production in China for that year reached 270.2 million tons, an increase of 1.07 times compared to 1957. Britain's raw coal production in 1957 was 223 million tons. The British Ministry of Power announced that the production in 1958 for 52 weeks (the whole year has 52 weeks and one day) totaled 215.78 million tons, a decrease of 3.5% compared to the same period in 1957. This means that the great call made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to strive to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major products within fifteen years or a shorter period has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded in the coal industry in just one year. Now, the capitalist country with coal production immediately ahead of China is the United States. According to the United Press International, as of December 20, the U.S. coal production in 1958 was 387 million tons. According to the targets set by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China's coal production in 1959 will reach 380 million tons.

Despite the fact that the imperialist gentlemen have made a lot of slanderous attacks on China's Great Leap Forward, saying that China's surpassing Britain is a "distant goal," and even saying, "Can a horse grow wings?" The fact that coal production has now surpassed Britain is the first answer to these gentlemen.

In just one year, the coal production, which was only a little more than half of Britain's, has been increased to far exceed Britain's. This is indeed like a horse growing wings, a miracle that has never appeared in the world. This miracle once again proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the infinite vitality of the new China. From 1898, when Li Hongzhang established the first modern mine in Kaiping (now Kailuan), to the eve of the national liberation in 1949, the old China produced only one billion tons of coal in sixty years. From the founding of the new China to the end of the first Five-Year Plan, coal production rose from 30.98 million tons in 1949 to 130.5 million tons in 1957, jumping from the tenth to the fifth place in the world, with an average annual growth rate of 19%. This was already a very fast speed, but in 1958 it increased by more than double. Compared with some capitalist countries, it took Britain thirty-seven years to increase from 129 million tons in 1873 to 268.6 million tons in 1910 (Britain's highest annual output reached 292 million tons, and began to decline after 1913); even the United States, which developed faster, took fourteen years to rise from 134.9 million tons in 1888 to 273.6 million tons in 1902.

The emergence of this miracle is a great victory for the general line of socialist construction in China, and the result of the thorough implementation of the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward on the industrial front. At the end of 1957, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the task of striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of major products in about fifteen years, the broad masses of coal miners set the goal of catching up with Britain in coal production in five years. Later, with the arrival of the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, and the in-depth implementation of the general line of socialist construction in the coal industry, a new situation immediately emerged in coal production. The broad masses of coal miners shortened the period for realizing this goal to three years and two years. But no one expected that when the people of the whole country began to fight for the goal of 10.7 million tons of steel, the coal industry, which is closely related to steel production, would leap forward at a tremendous speed. Coal mines operated by state-owned, local state-owned and people's communes all launched a high-yield movement to hoard grain and gather grass for the steel marshal. The national coal production in September increased by more than 40% compared with August, and the average monthly output in the fourth quarter increased by 60% compared with September. It was originally estimated that it would take until 1959 to reach the level of British coal production in 1957, but it was achieved in less than a year.

Carrying out mass movements on a large scale in the coal industry front, and implementing the policy of "small native groups" and "large foreign groups" walking on two legs, is an important factor for the bumper harvest of coal production in 1958. In terms of "small native groups," thousands of people across the country carried hoes and cooking utensils, and went deep into the mountains and ridges to dig coal. As a result, in just three months, the number of small coal kilns in various places increased from more than 20,000 to more than 100,000. This not only guaranteed the needs of steel production, but also changed the extremely unbalanced distribution of China's coal industry to a certain extent. The "large foreign groups" are the backbone of China's coal industry. In this regard, many coal mines, after adhering to putting politics in command, relying on the masses, making great technical revolutions, and implementing various advanced management experiences, have also seen a straight upward trend in coal production. In December 1958, the average daily output of 52 state-owned coal mines reached 610,000 tons, an increase of 97% compared with January 1958; the average daily production of coal per miner throughout the year increased by 0.36 tons compared with 1957. The speed of mine construction has also developed rapidly. In 1958, more than 90 pairs of mechanized mines with an annual production capacity of more than 150,000 tons were put into production nationwide, an increase of 40 pairs compared with the new mines in 1957.

The assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries has also played a great role in the Great Leap Forward of China's coal industry.

While coal production has increased sharply, the production conditions of China's coal mines are also improving day by day. In 1958, the state purchased more than 300 combines and coal cutters to improve the mechanization of the original mines, and the number of ventilation and transportation machinery increased even more. At present, the practice of manual coal mining has almost disappeared in China's state-owned coal mines, and the degree of mechanization of working face and roadway transportation has increased to more than 90%. With the development of the mass technical revolution movement, some of the latest technologies that can fundamentally improve the working conditions of underground workers are also being adopted in many coal mines in China with the help of Soviet experts. In 1958, a total of eight fully hydraulic mines (including hydraulic coal mining, hydraulic transportation, and hydraulic hoisting) have been built, and 115 hydraulic coal mining working faces have been put into production. Due to the summary and promotion of advanced experience in reducing silica dust, the average dust content in the air per cubic meter in many mines when tunneling rock roadways has been reduced to less than 2 milligrams. Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry has also formulated a plan to transform small coal kilns. The plan is to transform more than 3,200 small coal kilns in 1959, so that they become mines that use mechanical or semi-mechanical hoisting, and gradually reduce heavy physical labor.

    东风浩荡赶英国旗开得胜
    我国去年产煤二亿七千多万吨，比1957年增长一倍多
    英国去年产煤二亿一千多万吨，比1957年下降3.5％
    新华社4日讯　本社记者报道：当全国人民欢欣鼓舞地庆贺新年的时候，我国煤炭工业战线上传出了令人振奋的捷报：1958年，我国煤炭产量已经远远超过英国。
    据本社记者从煤炭工业部获悉：截止1958年12月31日二十四时的统计，这一年我国共计生产了二亿七千零二十万吨原煤，比1957年增长一点零七倍。英国1957年的原煤产量是二亿二千三百多万吨，1958年的产量，据英国动力部宣布，五十二周（全年共五十二周又一天）共二亿一千五百七十八万吨，比1957年同期减产3.5％。这就是说，中共中央提出的争取在十五年或者更短的时期内在主要产品产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大号召，在煤炭工业方面只用一年时间就提前、超额完成了。现在，煤产量紧挨在我国前面的资本主义国家就是美国了。据合众国际社报道，到12月20日止，美国1958年的煤产量是三亿八千七百万吨。根据中共八届六中全会提出的指标，我国1959年煤产量将达三亿八千万吨。
    尽管帝国主义的先生们对我国的大跃进进行了不少污蔑与攻击，说什么我国超过英国是“遥远的目标”。甚至还有人说：“难道马还能长上翅膀？”现在煤炭产量已超过英国的事实，就是给这些先生们的第一个答复。
    在短短的一年内，就把原来只及英国一半多一些的煤炭产量提高到大大超过英国，这的确像马长上翅膀一样，是世界上从来没有出现的奇迹。这个奇迹再次证明社会主义制度的无比优越性，新中国的无限生命力。旧中国从1898年李鸿章在开平（现在的开滦）建立第一对近代化矿井起，到1949年全国解放前夕的六十年间总共也不过生产了十亿吨煤炭。新中国从成立以后到第一个五年计划结束，煤炭产量从1949年的三千零九十八万吨上升到1957年的一亿三千零五十万吨，从原来世界第十位跃居到第五位，每年平均增长速度为19％。这已经是很快的速度了，但1958年却增长了一倍多。如果与一些资本主义国家比较，英国从1873年的一亿二千九百万吨提高到1910年的二亿六千八百六十万吨共计用了三十七年（英国最高年产量曾达二亿九千二百万吨，1913年后开始下降）；即使发展速度较快的美国，从1888年的一亿三千四百九十万吨上升到1902年的二亿七千三百六十万吨，也整整走了十四年。
    这一奇迹的出现，是我国社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是工业战线上贯彻执行以钢为纲、全面跃进方针的结果。1957年底，中共中央提出争取十五年左右主要产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的任务时，广大煤矿职工就曾订出了煤炭产量五年赶上英国的奋斗目标。以后，随着全国大跃进形势的到来，和煤炭工业深入贯彻执行了社会主义建设总路线，煤炭生产立刻出现了崭新的局面。广大煤矿职工把实现这个奋斗目标的时期缩短为三年、两年。可是谁也没有料到，当全国人民为夺取一○七○万吨钢的大战开始以后，与钢铁生产有着密切联系的煤炭工业便以一日千里之势飞跃前进。不论国营、地方国营和人民公社经营的煤矿都开展了为钢铁元帅囤粮聚草的高产运动。9月份全国煤产量比8月份增长了40％以上，第四季度平均月产量又比9月份增长了60％。原来估计最快也要1959年才能达到1957年英国煤炭产量的水平，结果不到一年就达到了。
    在煤炭工业战线上大搞群众运动，贯彻执行了“小土群”和“大洋群”两条腿走路的方针，是1958年煤炭生产大丰收的重要因素。在“小土群”方面，全国成千上万的人背着镢头，带着锅灶，深入丛山峻岭去挖掘煤炭。因而在短短三个月内，各地小煤窑的数量就从原来的二万多个增加到十多万个。这样不但保证了钢铁生产的需要，也在一定程度上改变了我国煤炭工业分布极不平衡的现象。“大洋群”是我国煤炭工业的骨干，在这方面许多煤矿在坚持政治挂帅、依靠群众、大闹技术革命和推行各项先进的管理经验以后，煤炭产量也是直线上升。1958年12月份五十二个国营煤矿的平均日产量已达六十一万吨，比1958年1月份上升了97％；全年平均每个矿工每天生产的煤炭比1957年增加了0.36吨。矿井建设的速度也飞跃发展。1958年全国投入生产的年产能力在十五万吨以上的机械化矿井就有九十多对，比1957年新增矿井增加四十对。
    苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助，对于我国煤炭工业的大跃进也起了很大作用。
  在煤炭产量急剧增长的同时，我国煤矿的生产条件也正在日益改善。1958年国家为提高原有矿井的机械化程度，就购置了康拜因和截煤机三百多台，通风和运输机械增加得更多。目前，我国国营煤矿中手镐采煤的作法已几乎绝迹，工作面和巷道运输的机械化程度提高到90％以上。随着群众性技术革命运动的开展，一些可以根本改善井下工人劳动条件的最新技术，在苏联专家的帮助下也在我国许多煤矿中开始采用。1958年已经建成的全部水力化（包括水力采煤、水力运输、水力提升）矿井就有八对，投入生产的水力采煤工作面一百一十五个。由于总结和推广了降低矽尘的先进经验，目前很多矿井在掘进岩石巷道时平均每立方公尺空气中的含尘量已减少到二毫克以下。最近，煤炭工业部还制订了一个改造小煤窑的规划。计划在1959年改造小煤窑三千二百多个，使它们成为利用机械或半机械提升的矿井，逐步减轻笨重的体力劳动。
