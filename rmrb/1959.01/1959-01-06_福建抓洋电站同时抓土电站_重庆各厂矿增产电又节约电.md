    Fujian Grasps Foreign Power Stations While Also Grasping Indigenous Power Stations
    Chongqing Factories and Mines Increase Electricity Production and Save Electricity
    (Reported by this newspaper) The people of Fujian have launched a mass movement to build power stations, which has achieved great success.
    The province's large-scale industrial capital construction and the Great Leap Forward in Steel demand that electricity generation be accelerated. To adapt to this situation, the province is vigorously building power stations. The power generating capacity of the power stations under construction is nearly 500,000 kilowatts, which is more than ten times the total power generating capacity of the province in 1957. The Gutianxi First-Level Phase II hydropower construction project, with a total generating capacity of 60,000 kilowatts, is under intense construction. The main projects of the Gutianxi Second, Third, and Fourth Level power stations have also begun full-scale construction.
    While building large-scale foreign-style power stations, various regions, based on the principle of walking on two legs, have launched a mass movement to build power stations. The broad masses of farmers have demonstrated extraordinary creativity, actively utilizing various natural resources such as water, wind, tides, and biogas in accordance with local conditions, scattering a network of small power stations throughout the province. In 1958 alone, more than 3,000 hydropower, wind power, tidal power, and biogas power stations were built.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Chongqing's factories and mining enterprises are vigorously tapping potential, increasing electricity production and saving electricity.
    Workers in various factories are finding ways to use waste water, sewage, waste gas, and other power resources to generate electricity. Workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company used wastewater that originally flowed into the Yangtze River through sewers to drive a 22-horsepower water turbine to generate electricity. The Chongqing Jiangling Machinery Factory combined the factory's sewage and the water from nearby small streams to impel generators, establishing a 30-kilowatt power station.
    Various factories are actively finding ways to solve the problem of power generation equipment. Workers at the Chongqing Machinery Factory are actively learning to produce generators, and quickly manufactured ten small water turbine generators to support factories and mines in urgent need of generators to build power stations.
    Workers in Chongqing's factories and mines are also actively finding ways to save electricity in production and daily life. Factories that originally used electric furnaces to process parts have switched to using coal gas furnaces and honeycomb briquette stoves for heat processing. After many machinery factories promoted the advanced experience of high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-blade cutting, the output and quality of products have greatly improved, and the electricity consumption per unit of output has relatively decreased.

    福建抓洋电站同时抓土电站
    重庆各厂矿增产电又节约电
    本报讯　福建人民开展全民办电运动，已经取得巨大成就。
    全省大规模的工业基本建设和大搞钢铁运动，要求电力先行快马加鞭。为适应这一形势，全省大兴电站建设，施工中的电站发电能力近五十万瓩。相当于1957年全省发电能力总和的十几倍。发电总量达六万瓩的古田溪一级二期水电建设工程正在紧张施工。古田溪二、三、四级电站的主体工程也开始全面施工。
    在建设大洋电站的同时，各地根据两条腿走路的方针，开展了全民办电运动。广大农民表现了非凡的创造精神，因地制宜地积极利用水、风、潮、气等各种天然资源，在全省撒下了一个小型电站网。1958年一年兴建水力、风力、潮力和沼气发电站即达三千多座。
    本报讯　重庆各厂矿企业大力挖掘潜力，增产和节约电力。
    各厂职工设法利用废水、污水和废气等各种动力资源发电。重庆钢铁公司的职工利用原来从下水道流入长江的废水带动二十二马力的水轮机发电。重庆江陵机器厂将厂里的污水和附近小溪沟的水合流起来冲击发电机，建立了一个三十瓩的发电站。
    各厂积极想办法解决发电设备。重庆机器厂的职工积极学习生产发电机，很快制造出十部小型水轮发电机，支援急需发电机的厂矿兴办电站。
    重庆各厂矿职工还在生产和生活方面积极设法节约用电。原来用电炉加工机件的厂子，纷纷改用煤汽炉、蜂窝炉作热加工。许多机械厂推行了快速切削、多刀多刃的先进经验以后，产品的产量和质量都提高很多，相对地也减少了单位产量的用电量。
