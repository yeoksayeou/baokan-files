Facing the Overall Situation
　　Wang Pu
　　Socialist enterprises must resolutely implement state plans; this is a principle everyone understands. However, the plans issued by the state to enterprises often only stipulate certain major indicators and cannot possibly include all the details. Because plans must reflect objective reality, objective circumstances often change in the process of implementing the plans. Under these circumstances, even the most experienced planning staff cannot reflect situations that have not yet arisen in the plan. Therefore, for any enterprise, while strictly implementing state plans, it is permissible to have a certain degree of “flexibility” to adapt to local conditions and act according to circumstances. This is what is commonly referred to as the combination of the seriousness and flexibility of planning.
　　Since there is “flexibility,” the question arises of where to “flex.” Should it be in the direction of what the state and society urgently need, or in the direction of what is only beneficial to the enterprise itself? There is much to be considered here. For example, when the workers of the Beijing Lengfeng Machinery Factory discussed the production plan for the first quarter, they reflected two different directions of flexibility. Some people advocated producing varieties that the state did not urgently need but had high output value and few specifications, transferring some small-output and sporadic products to other factories. Most people advocated producing varieties with small output value but which were sporadic, but urgently needed by the state, with more variety and specifications. After some debate, they decided on the latter direction and rejected the former.
　　The direction of the Beijing Lengfeng Machinery Factory is very correct. Because this direction starts from meeting the urgent needs of the state and from the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game. This is the only basis for socialist enterprises to be flexible when implementing state plans. Conversely, if one only starts from the convenience of the enterprise, the result may be detrimental to the overall situation.
　　Every enterprise's production plan should face the overall situation and consider the requirements of the overall situation. If the state needs high output value, then produce high output value; if it needs small output value, then produce small output value; if it needs large-scale production, then produce large-scale production; if it needs sporadic varieties, then produce sporadic varieties; if it needs high-grade products, then produce high-grade products; if it needs low-grade products, then produce low-grade products. This is the style that our socialist enterprises should have.

    面向全局
    王朴
    社会主义企业一定要坚决执行国家计划，这是大家都明白的道理。但是国家下达给企业的计划，往往只规定若干主要指标，而不可能把一切细节都包括进去。因为计划是要反映客观实际的，在执行计划的过程中，客观情况往往会起变化，在这种情况下，就是最有经验的计划工作人员，也不可能把还没出现的情况反映到计划里去。所以，不论对什么企业，在严格执行国家计划的前提下，都允许有一定的因地制宜、见机而行的“机动”权。这就是通常说的计划的严肃性和灵活性相结合。
    既然“机动”，就产生一个向哪里“机动”的问题。是向国家和社会迫切需要的方向，还是向仅仅对本企业有利的方向？这里就有文章。例如北京冷风机械厂职工在讨论第一季度生产计划时，就反映了两种不同的机动方向。有些人主张生产国家虽不迫切需要但产值大规格少的品种，把一些产值小而又零星的产品转给别的工厂去做。大多数人则主张多生产产值虽小而零星，但国家迫切需要的品种，品种规格要多些。他们经过一番辩论以后，决定后一种方向，而否定了前一种方向。
    北京冷风机械厂的方向很对。因为这个方向是从满足国家迫切需要出发，从全国一盘棋的原则出发。这是社会主义企业在执行国家计划中机动和灵活的唯一依据。反之，只从本企业方便与否出发，其结果就可能对全局不利。
    每个企业的生产计划都应当面向全局，考虑到全局的要求。国家需要产值大的，就生产产值大的；需要产值小的就生产小的；需要大批生产，就大批生产；需要零星的品种，就生产零星的品种；需要高级产品，就生产高级产品；需要低级产品，就生产低级产品。这就是我们社会主义企业应有的风格。
