Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 19th. In Anhui Province, most of this year's summer harvest crops were planted early, with ample base fertilizer, deep plowing and close planting, resulting in deep furrows and high ridges. The seedlings are generally growing vigorously. Various localities are continuously adopting new measures based on these characteristics to improve the quality of field management.

Due to the high nutrient demand of close planting, the base fertilizer, though plentiful, is still insufficient to meet the needs of wheat and rapeseed seedlings. Therefore, various localities are paying close attention to topdressing. In the Fuyang Special Zone, over ten million mu of wheat fields have basically been topdressed once, with an average topdressing amount of around 500 dan. Large areas of high-yielding fields and high-yield plots have generally begun a second topdressing, with larger amounts than in general fields. This method of continuous topdressing ensures that the densely sown wheat receives a continuous supply of nutrients during the tillering, greening, and jointing stages.

To prevent dense seedlings from freezing, as well as to prevent yellowing, etiolation, and premature heading, various localities have rolled the wheat seedlings and carried out shallow hoeing to cultivate the soil around the roots, preserving warmth and moisture. Areas along the Yangtze River and in the Huainan region generally adopted the method of universally pressing pond mud; areas in northern Anhui generally used livestock manure and fire ash to cover and press the fertilizer, in combination with topdressing.

This year, some places have dug deep field ditches with steep slopes, making it easy for the ditch mud to collapse, affecting drainage, and making the wheat susceptible to rust. In light of this, various localities are carrying out ditch clearing work on wheat fields with steep slopes in conjunction with winter irrigation. Some places are using soil pesticides and "666" pesticide powder in advance to prevent insect pests.

This year, most summer harvest crops were planted early, planted well, and are growing vigorously, but there are also individual places and plots that were planted late, lack sufficient base fertilizer, and whose cultivation techniques have not met the original standards, resulting in a small number of third-class seedlings. To ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest, people's communes across Anhui are carrying out work to eliminate third-class seedlings. Shucheng County is using a comprehensive application of chemical fertilizer, cake fertilizer, and human manure to third-class seedlings, and is continuously and rationally topdressing, so that all third-class seedlings in the county have now been upgraded.

To ensure the effective implementation of new field management measures, Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province have conscientiously implemented political command and vigorously mobilized the masses. Taking Shucheng County as an example, more than 150 county, district, and commune Party secretaries and members went deep into the fields, taking the lead in making a model of garden-style field management to promote the improvement of field management quality among the broad masses of commune members. At the same time, the county, districts, and communes also established field management technical research groups, led by the first secretary or secretary of the Party committees at all levels. The county Party committee also hired four experienced farmers as consultants, working with more than 80 technical cadres to form four guidance groups to conduct roving guidance in various places, adopting the method of learning what is done, giving lessons in the fields, cultivating a technical team for managing wheat fields, and studying wheat field management measures. In terms of mobilizing the masses, various localities have generally adopted methods such as on-site meetings, forums, and detailed accounting to explain the significance of improving the quality of summer harvest crop field management to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest; and have universally promoted the six-fixed method of fixing people, land, quantity, quality, time, and fertilizer, and established a field management responsibility system. At the same time, a field management archive system of "signs in the field, registers at home" has been established, with responsibility assigned to the end and checks and acceptance carried out.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 19th. A surge in wheat field winter management, focusing on topdressing, covering fertilizer, and watering with urine, is taking shape in various parts of Hebei. According to statistics up to January 13th, 22.47 million mu of the province's 35 million mu of wheat have been topdressed, 6.77 million mu have been covered with fertilizer, and 7.46 million mu have been watered with urine. Some areas have adopted continuous operations of accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, and covering fertilizer, achieving the requirements of accumulating, delivering, and covering fertilizer as needed.

In order to improve the quality of topdressing, various localities are crushing coarse fertilizer, applying fertilizer along the ridges, concentrating fertilizer power, and improving fertilizer efficiency. Most of this year's wheat fields were deep-plowed and sown, and after watering, cracks tend to appear, so Party committees in various localities are paying special attention to wheat field management. The Tianjin Special Zone began a large-scale blitz of covering fertilizer and rolling wheat on January 15th, aiming to universally cover fertilizer once in all wheat fields in the special zone, and roll them with stone rollers once or twice. As of January 8th, more than 10 million mu of wheat had been rolled throughout the province, making up for the cracks in the wheat fields and playing a great role in raising ground temperature, loosening the soil to preserve moisture, and eliminating clods in the wheat fields.

    安徽河北根据深耕密植特点追施冬肥
    让麦苗不断得到养料
    新华社合肥19日电　安徽省今年夏收作物大部分种得早，底肥多，并做到了深耕密植，沟深畦高，苗儿一般生长旺盛。各地都根据这些特点不断采取新的措施，提高田间管理的质量。
    由于密植需肥量大，基肥虽多还不能满足麦子、油菜苗需要，因此各地十分重视追肥工作。阜阳专区一千多万亩麦田目前已基本上追了一次肥，追肥平均在五百担左右。各地大面积丰产田和高产田一般都开始追二次肥，追肥量都比一般田多。这样用不断追肥的办法，使播种稠密的麦子在盘根返青、拔节各个阶段都能够源源不断地得到养料供应。
    为了防止稠密的幼苗受冻，以及防止黄瘦、拔节和过早孕穗，各地对麦苗已进行了镇压，并进行浅锄培土壅根，保温保墒。沿江和淮南地区一般都采用了普遍压塘泥；淮北地区一般用牲畜粪和火粪等办法结合追肥，进行复盖压肥。
    今年有些地方田沟挖得深，沟沿陡直，沟泥容易倒塌，影响排水，小麦容易发生锈病。根据这种情况，各地对沟沿陡直的麦田，结合冬灌进行清沟工作，有的地方提前用土农药和“六六六”药粉防治虫害。
    今年大部分夏收作物种得早、种得好、生长旺盛，但也有个别地方和个别地块种得较晚，基肥不足，耕作技术还没有达到原订标准，产生了少数三类苗。为了确保全面大丰收，安徽各地人民公社展开了消灭三类苗的工作。舒城县对三类苗采用化肥、饼肥、人粪尿综合施用的办法，连续地合理追肥，现在全县三类苗已块块升级。
    安徽省各级党委为了保证新的田间管理措施有效地贯彻，都认真实行了政治挂帅和大力发动群众。以舒城县为例，全县有一百五十多名县、区、公社党委书记和委员深入田间，带头做出田间管理园田化的样子，推动广大社员提高田间管理的质量。同时，县、区、公社还分别成立了田间管理技术研究小组，由各级党委第一书记或书记亲自领导。县委还聘请了四位老农作顾问，配合八十多个技术干部，组成四个辅导组，到各地进行巡回辅导，采取作什么，学什么的办法，在地头上课，培养管理麦田的技术队伍，研究麦田管理的措施。各地在发动群众方面，大都采用了现场会、座谈会和算细账等办法，说明提高夏收作物田间管理质量对保证农业大丰收的意义；并普遍推行了定人、定田、定量、定质、定时、定肥等六定办法，建立了田间管理责任制。同时还建立了“田头有牌子，家里有册子”的田间管理档案制度，一包到底，检查验收。
    据新华社天津19日电　一个以追肥、盖肥、浇尿为主的麦田越冬管理热潮正在河北各地形成。到1月13日的统计，全省三千五百多万亩小麦已追肥二千二百四十七万亩，盖肥六百七十七万亩，浇尿七百四十六万亩。有些地区采取了积肥、送粪、盖肥连续作业，达到了随积随送随盖的要求。
    为了提高追肥质量，各地都把粗肥砸烂，顺垅施肥，集中肥力，提高肥效。今年的麦田大部是深翻播种的，经过浇水后，容易发生裂缝现象，因此各地党委对麦田管理特别注意。天津专区从1月15日开始开展盖肥、轧麦大突击，要将全专区的麦田普遍盖肥一次，用碌碡普轧一次到两次。全省到1月8日止已轧麦一千多万亩，弥补了麦田的裂缝现象，对提高地温，松土保墒，消灭麦田坷垃起了很大作用。
