According to the New China Daily News, since the beginning of winter, the Gaotang Brigade of the Suicheng People's Commune in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, has launched a crash program to accumulate fertilizer. At present, the work of accumulating fertilizer has become regularized.

At first, everyone thought that there would not be much fertilizer this year. The silt in the ponds had been dug up last year, and it would be a waste of effort to dig it up again this year. There were only two types of fertilizer: old wall soil and stove soil. There was no other fertilizer to accumulate. However, after investigation, there were many sources of fertilizer, such as chicken coop soil and stove soil, totaling fourteen types of soil fertilizer. After the sources of fertilizer were found, labor was allocated rationally. In order not to affect the topdressing of wheat fields, it was decided to apply topdressing during the day and launch a crash program to accumulate fertilizer in the early morning and evening. In addition to the wheat field management professional team, more than 900 people, including cooks, feeders, and all auxiliary labor, were organized to participate in the fertilizer accumulation crash program during their spare time.

After the crash program, arrangements were made for regular fertilizer accumulation: 1. Pig raising for fertilizer accumulation. By the end of this year, in addition to collective feeding averaging one pig per person, each canteen should also actively raise pigs to meet the meat needs of commune members. Every pig should have a sty, be cleaned and bedded regularly, and accumulate 1,000 catties of fertilizer per month. 2. Livestock pens should be cleaned and bedded every day, and each livestock should accumulate 60 catties of fertilizer per day. 3. Do a good job in basic construction for fertilizer accumulation and strengthen the management of manure. Build a public toilet for every three to six households. Build outdoor toilets in remote fields and by the roadside. 4. Each production team should appoint two people to carry manure, collect urine from each household every morning, and clean the toilets. In this way, the entire brigade of 3,800 people can accumulate 3 to 5 catties of human excrement and urine per person per day. In addition, by collecting scattered manure, 1.5 million catties of fine fertilizer can be collected in two months.

### 突击积野肥　经常积家肥

    突击积野肥　经常积家肥
    据新华日报消息　江苏睢宁县睢城人民公社高塘大队入冬以来，已经开展了一次积肥突击运动，目前积肥工作已走向经常化。
    开始时，大家都认为今年肥源不多，汪淤去年已挖过，今年再挖是白费劳力，只有老墙土灶土两种，其他无肥可积。但通过排队，肥源多得很，如鸡棚土、灶土等就有十四种土肥。肥源找出来以后，他们又合理安排了劳力。为了不影响麦田追肥，决定白天追肥，早晨傍晚突击积肥，除麦田管理专业队全部参加外，还组织了炊事员、饲养员及所有附带劳力共九百多人，利用业余时间，投入积肥突击运动。
    突击运动过后，又对经常性的积肥作了安排：一、养猪积肥。到今年年底除集体喂养每人平均达一头外，各个食堂也要积极喂养，以满足社员的肉食需要。猪猪有圈，勤出勤垫，每头猪每月要积肥一千斤。二、牲畜圈要做到天天出，天天垫，每头牲畜每日要积肥六十斤。三、搞好积肥基本建设，加强粪便管理。每三至六户建一个公共厕所。在远田与大路边建野外厕所。四、每个生产队确定两人专门抬粪，每天早晨到每户门口集尿，打扫厕所。这样全大队三千八百多人，每人每天可积人粪尿三至五斤，加上拾散粪，两个月可拾细肥一百五十万斤。
