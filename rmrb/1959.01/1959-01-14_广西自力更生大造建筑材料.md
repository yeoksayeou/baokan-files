　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th January: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is launching mass movements everywhere to produce building materials and overcome the shortage of certain building materials through self-reliance.

　　Guangxi has many basic construction projects this year, concentrated in time, and with urgent tasks. Coupled with a weak industrial base, the shortage of building materials is a prominent difficulty. Under these circumstances, the relevant leadership departments have adopted the method of "small indigenous groups," relying on the masses, using local materials, producing building materials locally, and supplying them locally. Guilin and Liuzhou cities, under the unified leadership of the municipal party committee, established local materials offices to uniformly lead and deploy the production of building materials. Liuzhou City launched a mass movement to produce building materials in November last year. More than 5,000 people in the city regularly participate in the production of brick blanks. The Secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee personally took charge of this production, and the number of building material production units in the city increased from the original ten to sixty-two. By the end of December last year, the red bricks produced not only met the needs of the city but also supported the construction of key projects in Liuzhou. In addition, 3,643 various indigenous kilns were built in various places, producing more than 9,600 tons of high-grade cement and more than 85,700 tons of low-grade cement, supplying basic construction and water conservancy projects.

　　In order to solve the problem of insufficient building materials, various construction units in the autonomous region that undertake basic construction tasks also run factories to manufacture building materials and machinery and equipment according to the needs of the projects. The Sixth Engineering Company of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, based on the principle of "adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and comprehensive utilization," plans to build 26 factories. Cement plants, brick and tile plants, lumber mills, and repair shops have been built and put into production. Factories for glass fiber, silicate products, and quarrying are also being planned. They strive to achieve 30% to 40% self-sufficiency in building materials. Various construction units also use simple machinery and equipment and waste materials to make lathes, drills, concrete mixers, plate rolling machines, crushers, and other machinery to arm themselves and support other factories and mines.

　　While self-reliantly producing building materials, various construction units are also practicing strict economy, clearing warehouses, and increasing material sources. The employees of the directly affiliated wood processing plant of the Autonomous Region Construction and Installation Engineering Bureau improved their operating methods, tapped potential, and increased the wood output rate from 75% to 85% in the past.

    广西自力更生大造建筑材料
    据新华社南宁13日电　广西僮族自治区各地大搞群众运动，生产建筑材料，自力更生地克服某些建筑材料不足的困难。
    广西今年基本建设项目多，时间集中，任务紧急，加上原来工业基础薄弱，建筑材料供应不足的困难较为突出。在这种情况下，有关领导部门便采取“小土群”的办法，依靠群众，就地取材，就地生产建筑材料，就地供应。桂林、柳州两市在市委统一领导下，成立了地方材料办公室，统一领导和布置建筑材料的生产。柳州市在去年11月就掀起了全民大搞建筑材料的运动，全市经常参加生产砖坯的群众有五千多人。中共桂林市委书记亲自抓这项生产，全市建筑材料生产单位由原来的十个增加到六十二个，到去年12月底生产的红砖，除满足本市需要外，还支援了柳州的重点工程建设。另外，各地建成各种土立窑三千六百四十三座，生产九千六百多吨高标号水泥和八万五千七百多吨低标号水泥，供应了基本建设和水利建设工程。
    自治区担负基本建设任务的各建筑单位，为解决建筑材料不足的问题，也根据工程的需要，自办工厂，制造建筑材料和机器设备。建筑工程部第四工程局第六工程公司，根据“因地制宜、就地取材、综合利用”的原则，计划自建工厂二十六个，现已建成并投入生产的有水泥厂、砖瓦厂、制材厂、修械厂等；正在筹建的还有玻璃丝、矽酸盐制品、采石等工厂。他们力争做到30％到40％的建筑材料自给。各建筑单位还利用简陋的机器设备和废料自制车床、钻床、混凝土搅拌机、卷板机、破碎机等机械，武装自己和支援其他厂矿。
    在自力更生生产建筑材料的同时，各建筑单位还厉行节约，清理仓库，增加材料来源。自治区建筑安装工程局直属木材加工厂的职工，改进操作方法，挖掘潜力，把木材出材率由过去的75％提高为85％。
