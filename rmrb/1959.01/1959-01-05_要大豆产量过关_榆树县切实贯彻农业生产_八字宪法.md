Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 4th—The people of Yushu County, Jilin Province, a well-known soybean production area in Northeast China, are enthusiastically responding to the ten initiatives of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, striving to achieve an average soybean yield of over 500 jin per mu this year, and successfully navigating this crucial soybean production hurdle.

Yushu County's planned soybean planting area this year accounts for one-eighth of the province's planned planting area. In addition to general farmland, half of the county's basic farmland will be planted with soybeans. In order to strive for high soybean yields, the people of the county are resolutely and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Currently, 35% of the labor force is being mobilized to actively carry out a manure accumulation campaign, to greatly increase the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of soybeans. Another 25% of the labor force is being allocated to water conservancy construction such as well digging and water cellar construction to overcome any drought that may occur this year. Specific measures have also been formulated to implement reduced row spacing, increased rows, and thorough close planting. Currently, the county is holding a meeting of township Party committee secretaries to study how to improve labor organization and do a good job in winter production, responding to the ten initiatives with practical actions.

    要大豆产量过关
    榆树县切实贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”
    新华社长春4日电　著名的东北大豆产地吉林省榆树县人民，热烈响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的十大倡议，力争今年大豆平均亩产达到五百斤以上，过好大豆生产这一关。
    榆树县今年大豆计划播种面积占全省计划播种面积八分之一。除一般农田外，全县的基本农田将有半数种植大豆。为了争取大豆高产，全县人民坚决全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”。目前正抽调35％的劳动力积极开展积肥运动，以大量增加每亩大豆的施肥量；另外抽调25％的劳动力进行打井、挖水柜等水利建设，以战胜今年可能发生的任何旱象。在实行缩垅、增行、贯彻密植方面也订出了具体措施。现在，这个县正在召开乡党委书记会议，研究改善劳动组织，搞好冬季生产，用实际行动响应十大倡议。
