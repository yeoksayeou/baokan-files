Editorial Note:

Foresight is Even More Necessary During the Great Leap Forward

Whether in revolution or construction, foresight on the part of leaders is extremely important. Complex struggles require leaders to be far-sighted and lead the masses forward, standing at the forefront of the movement. The solution by the Chen County Committee in Hunan Province to the shortage of small farm tools and household utensils under the situation of the Great Leap Forward is one such example. In fact, this is not the only case! In the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, other matters are the same; without this foresight, one will feel passive everywhere.

Where does the foresight of leaders come from?

The matter is not mysterious; it mainly comes from concrete analysis of specific problems. The Chen County Committee, because it discovered that after communization, the broad masses of women were liberated from housework and participated in productive labor, increasing the demand for small farm tools; because it promptly noticed that blacksmiths and carpenters participated in steelmaking during last winter, failing to manufacture these things as in previous years; because it analyzed the fact that "winter is not idle" after the Great Leap Forward, leading to increased tool consumption, it arrived at the correct conclusion to rush-manufacture small farm tools, and foresaw that only by solving these problems early could this year's bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward be more powerfully promoted.

The Great Leap Forward raises many new questions. It is not possible to follow the old rules. We must, based on the changed situation, improve and elevate our thinking, organization, and various work measures in a timely manner to meet the needs of the new situation.

### 大跃进中更需要预见性

    大跃进中更需要预见性
    不论是在革命中，还是在建设中，领导的预见性是极为重要的。复杂的斗争要求领导者高瞻远瞩，站在运动的前面领导群众前进。湖南省郴县县委解决大跃进的形势下小农具和家庭小用具供应不足就是其中的一例。其实何止这一例呢！在农业生产大跃进的新形势下，别的事情也是一样，没有这种预见性，就会处处感到被动。
    领导者的预见性从何而来呢？
    事情也并不玄妙，主要是对具体问题的具体分析。郴县县委由于发现了公社化以后广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了生产劳动，小农具需要量增加；由于及时地注意到去冬铁匠木匠参加炼钢炼铁，没有能够像往年一样在冬季制造这些东西；由于分析了大跃进以后“冬闲不闲”工具损耗增加的事实，便得出了赶制小农具的正确结论，便预见到只有把这些问题及早解决，才能更有力地促进今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    大跃进提出很多新问题，如果仍按照老规矩办事是不行的，必须根据变化了的情况，把我们的思想、组织以及各种工作措施及时地加以改进和提高，才能适应新形势的需要。
