    “The old world is collapsing more every day…”
    --Excerpt from Rosa Luxemburg's "Letters from Prison"
    "...I am very calm and happy now, as always. Yesterday I lay in bed for a long time unable to fall asleep -- now I can't sleep for less than an hour anyway, but I have to go to bed at ten o'clock -- so I meditated on various things in the dark. ...I lay quietly alone, my body seemingly wrapped in layers of the winter's darkness, melancholy, and the black cloth of unfreedom—but my heart was throbbing with an elusive, strange inner joy, as if I were walking through a splendid meadow in the bright sunlight. In the darkness, I smiled at life, as if I had learned a magic secret that could punish all evils and disheartening lies, and turn them all into pure light and happiness. At the same time, I was looking for the source of this joy myself, but I couldn't find anything, so I mocked myself again. I believe that this secret is nothing else but life itself, the pitch-black night is beautiful and soft like velvet, as long as you look at it correctly."
    "...But you must have patience and courage! We will live on, and we will experience earth-shattering things. Now we first perceive how the entire old world is sinking, a piece of it sinking every day, a new collapse every day, a new world turned upside down every day... The most ridiculous thing is that most people don't realize it at all, and still believe they are walking on solid ground..."

    “旧世界每天有新的崩裂……”
    ——摘自罗莎·卢森堡的“狱中书简”
    “……我现在非常平静、愉快，一如往日。昨天我躺在床上，长久不能入睡——如今我不到一点钟无论如何也睡不着，但是十点钟就必须上床——于是我在黑暗中冥想种种事情。……我一个人静静地躺着，身子像是被冬日的黑暗、烦闷和不自由的黑布层层缠裹住——但是我的心却由于一种无从捉摸的、奇怪的内在的喜悦而怦怦地跳动着，就好像我在辉煌的日光下走过一片绚烂的草原一样。在黑暗里我向生活微笑，仿佛我已得知一个魔术的秘密，这秘密能制裁一切邪恶和令人沮丧的谎言，并能把这一切化为纯然的光明和幸福。同时我自己也在寻找这种喜悦的根源，我什么也寻不着，只好再自嘲了一通。我相信，这秘密不是什么别的，它正是生活本身，漆黑的夜幕美丽、柔软得像天鹅绒，只要你正确地看它。”
    “……但是你要有耐心和勇气！我们还要活下去，我们还要经历惊天动地的事呢。现在我们首先觉察出来，整个旧世界如何在沉沦下去，每天有一块地方沉陷，每天有新的崩裂，每天有新的天翻地复……最可笑的是，大多数人根本就没有觉察到，还在相信他们是在坚实的土地上行走……”
