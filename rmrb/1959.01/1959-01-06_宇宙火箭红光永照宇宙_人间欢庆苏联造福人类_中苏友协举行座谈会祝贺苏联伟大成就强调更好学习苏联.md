Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association jointly held a symposium this afternoon to celebrate the Soviet Union's giant cosmic rocket successfully flying past the moon into space. The symposium was presided over by Guo Moruo, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters. Guo Moruo said that the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket successfully flying past the moon and becoming a new planet in the solar system has enormous significance not only in science and technology but also in politics, economics, and culture. The Soviet Union's victory is also our victory. This event further confirms Chairman Mao's statement that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. Soviet science and technology have reached an astonishing height. All progressive, righteous people around the world who care about human happiness are overjoyed and celebrating this great event.

Speakers at the meeting unanimously praised the great significance of this Soviet scientific feat. They discussed this great achievement with great interest, imagining the space secrets that would be revealed. Many people said that the red rocket broadened their minds, and some elderly people even spontaneously recited poems to praise it.

Many people pointed out that the Soviet Union's great achievement in launching a cosmic rocket demonstrated the further strengthening of the forces defending peace and was the glory and victory of peace-loving people around the world. Chen Shutong, Xu Deheng, and Chu Tunan said that the Soviet Union's achievement has great significance for safeguarding world peace and is a head-on blow to warmongers. At the beginning of 1959, the Soviet Union's red flag flew to the solar system, proving that the socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong. Li Jishen said in a written statement that the strength of the socialist camp will be further enhanced as a result, and the confidence of people all over the world in the struggle for peace and social progress will be greatly encouraged. He emphasized that we firmly believe that 1959 will be the beginning of even greater victories for the socialist camp, and that it will advance with even more magnificent strides in the future. Let the imperialists tremble before this powerful force for peace!

Chen Shutong read a poem at the meeting. The poem reads: "In 1959, the Soviet Union presented the world with a gift, large and abundant. Once again proving that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind, and further meaning that Chairman Mao's statement that the United States is a paper tiger has bright eyes..."

In analyzing the reasons for the Soviet Union's launch of a giant cosmic rocket, everyone believed that the most important thing was the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Huang Yanpei said that the fundamental reason for the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology is the superiority of the socialist system and the good relationship between people. However, under the capitalist system, people deceive each other and fight each other, so the United States is far behind. Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that this scientific achievement of the Soviet Union is mainly due to putting politics in command. Li Zhuchen pointed out that socialist countries engage in science and technology in a planned and collective manner, so they are successful. Li Wei, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said that officers and soldiers of all units of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically cheered the great achievements of the Soviet people. Everyone believed that the success of the Soviet Union in launching a cosmic rocket demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system and won the world championship in science and technology.

When discussing the reasons for the failure of the United States to launch a small lunar rocket and the success of the Soviet Union in launching a giant cosmic rocket, many people also pointed out that this is because the purpose of the two countries in scientific research is completely different. Shao Lizi said that the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket to benefit mankind and further conquer nature, while the United States handed over the work of launching a lunar rocket to the military department with the aim of war and dominating the world. Therefore, the key to success or failure lies in the different social systems. Liu Ningyi said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have achieved highly developed economic construction, and science has also been highly developed accordingly. The cosmic rocket was successfully launched on this basis. He believed that the Soviet Union will have even greater achievements in the future, while all the efforts of American imperialism are developing in the direction of destruction. He said excitedly that now everything on earth surpasses the sky, and those who surpass the sky are our Marxists-Leninists. The speeches of Chu Tunan and others all pointed out that the great achievements of Soviet science are also due to the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Li Dequan said enthusiastically: People will surely conquer nature, and everything proves the greatness of Marxist-Leninist principles.

Scientists explained from the perspective of science and technology that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket was an extremely complex and arduous task, the crystallization of huge manpower, material resources, and creative labor, and the result of highly developed productivity and advanced levels of various sciences and technologies. Qian Xuesen, a specialist in mechanics, said that to launch such a heavy artificial planet into space at such a high speed, the rocket can be imagined to be a huge behemoth. Therefore, this matter is very difficult in terms of engineering technology, and its amount of labor is extremely large. Qian Xuesen believes that the Soviet Union chose the period of the waning moon to launch the cosmic rocket in the direction of the moon, which shows that the Soviet Union was consciously making this rocket a new planet orbiting the sun. He believes that from the perspective of power and control, the Soviet Union has the possibility of launching rockets to Mars. Physicist Zhou Peiyuan said that cosmic rockets require alloys, fuels, and control to reach extremely high levels, and these three aspects involve complex science and technology, so the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket is a sign of the high level of its comprehensive development of science and technology. Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, said that labor can create the world, and now the labor of the Soviet people has also created planets.

The speakers emphasized that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket is also a powerful driving force for promoting and inspiring the Chinese people to accelerate socialist construction. They expressed that they would better learn from the Soviet Union, work hard, and contribute more to the construction of the great motherland. Chang Enshan, a worker at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and a model worker in Beijing's industry, Zhou Ximing, head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Locomotive Driver Team of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, and Ma Fengshan, director of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, all expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people for their great contributions to human happiness. They proposed to congratulate the victory of the Soviet people with practical actions in their respective positions. Chang Enshan said that the Soviet people have given great assistance to our industrial construction. Our working class must learn from the Soviet Union and make achievements on the industrial front to complete the tasks of 1959 in order to thank the Soviet people. Zhou Ximing mentioned that on the day they heard the news, their driver team immediately held a meeting to discuss their leap forward plan, proposing to haul more and run faster in the future to better complete transportation tasks. Ma Fengshan said that our farmers sincerely admire the great achievements of the Soviet people. In 1959, we must work harder to strive for greater harvests in agriculture and strive for the early arrival of a communist happy life. Liu Xiyuan, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that the excitement of Chinese youth is indescribable. The achievements of the Soviet Union show that the East Wind has spread all over the world. The youth have proposed to take the Soviet youth as a model, study harder, and contribute to the motherland in climbing the peaks of science. Li Dequan and Shi Liang both talked about how the Chinese people and Chinese women should accelerate construction on all fronts and make greater contributions in various construction positions. Li Dequan also specifically mentioned that in the future, we must better learn from the Soviet Union, do a good job in construction, make the Chinese people live better, and build a happy life where everyone is happy and healthy.

Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, proposed to better strengthen the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and develop Sino-Soviet friendship. Qian Junrui said that the Soviet Union's successful launch of a cosmic rocket once again proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and demonstrated the wisdom and greatness of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He suggested that the people of the whole country should learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard struggle, learn their creativity and pragmatic spirit, and further strengthen the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Guo Moruo said at the end of the symposium that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket is by no means purely a matter of science and technology, but a review of the entire Soviet construction cause, indicating that the Soviet Union has achieved great achievements in all aspects of construction. He believes that these achievements are the victory of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the victory of Marxism-Leninism. Guo Moruo said that when we learn from the Soviet Union, we must first adhere to putting politics in command in various tasks, using redness to lead expertise, promoting collectivism, and promoting the spirit of cooperation. Secondly, we must learn from their practical and hard-working honest attitude, learn their revolutionary enthusiasm and the spirit of combining scientific analysis, and build our country better.

The symposium unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association and the Soviet Academy of Sciences at the end.

Those who spoke and submitted written statements at the meeting also included Shen Yanbing, Ji Fang, Cao Jinghua, Wang Zhixiang, Wang Yunsheng, Yan Xichun, Zhang Zishi, and Zhang Bingguang. (Attached picture)

    宇宙火箭红光永照宇宙
    人间欢庆苏联造福人类
    中苏友协举行座谈会祝贺苏联伟大成就强调更好学习苏联
    新华社5日讯　中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友协今日下午联合举行座谈会，庆贺苏联巨型宇宙火箭胜利越过月球附近飞行于太空。座谈会由中苏友协总会副会长郭沫若主持。郭沫若说，苏联宇宙火箭成功地越过月球附近成为太阳系的新行星，不但在科学技术上而且在政治上、经济上和文化上都有巨大的意义；苏联的胜利，也就是我们的胜利，这件事情进一步证实了毛主席说的东风已经压倒了西风；苏联的科学技术达到了惊人的高度，全世界所有进步的、有正义感的、关心人类幸福的人，都为这件大事欢欣鼓舞，普天同庆。
    会上发言的人同声赞扬苏联这一科学创举的巨大意义。他们以极大的兴趣谈论这一伟大成就，设想着将被揭破的太空秘密，许多人谈到，红色火箭使他们的心胸开阔了，有的老人并且在会上情不自禁地吟诗歌颂。
    许多人指出，苏联发射宇宙火箭的伟大成就，表明保卫和平力量的进一步强大，是世界爱好和平人民的光荣和胜利。陈叔通、许德珩和楚图南等人说，苏联的这一成就对保卫世界和平有着重大的意义，是对战争贩子的当头一棒，1959年一开始苏联的红旗就飞到太阳系，这证明社会主义阵营已空前强大。李济深在书面发言中说，社会主义阵营的力量将因此更加增强，全世界人民争取和平和社会进步的斗争的信心将得到更大的鼓舞。他强调说，我们坚信1959年将是社会主义阵营取得更伟大胜利的开始，今后必将以更加雄伟的步伐向前迈进。让帝国主义者在这一强大的和平力量面前发抖吧！
    陈叔通在会上朗读了一首诗。诗中写道：“1959年苏联向全世界献礼，硕大且丰。又一次证明东风压倒了西风，更意味着毛主席的美国是纸老虎的言论，有雪亮的双瞳……。”
    在分析苏联发射巨型宇宙火箭的原因时，大家认为最主要的是社会主义制度的无比优越和苏联共产党的英明领导。黄炎培说，苏联科学技术如此先进，基本原因是社会主义制度的优越，人与人的关系好，但是资本主义制度下人们尔虞我诈，互相倾轧，所以美国是远远落后了。中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊说，苏联这一科学成就主要是由于政治挂帅。李烛尘指出社会主义国家搞科学技术是有计划地、集体协作地搞，所以就搞得成功。中国人民解放军代表李伟说，解放军各部队官兵都热烈地欢呼苏联人民的伟大成就，大家认为苏联发射宇宙火箭的成功，表明了社会主义制度的优越，科学技术上得到了世界冠军。
    许多人在谈到美国发射小型月球火箭失败和苏联发射巨型宇宙火箭获得成功的原因时，还指出这是由于两国研究科学的目的性是迥然不同的。邵力子说，苏联发射宇宙火箭是为了造福人类，进一步征服自然，而美国把发射月球火箭的工作交给军事部门，目的是为了战争，为了霸占世界，所以成败的关键还是在于两个社会制度的不同。刘宁一说，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，经济建设获得高度的发展，相应地科学也得到高度发展，宇宙火箭是在这样的基础上发射成功的。他相信今后苏联还会有更大的成就，而美帝国主义的一切努力，却是向着毁灭的方向发展。他兴奋地说，现在人间样样事件胜天空，胜天空者是我们马列主义者。楚图南等人的发言都指出，苏联科学的伟大成就也是由于有马克思列宁主义思想的指导。李德全热情洋溢地说：人一定胜天，一切证明马克思列宁主义原则的伟大。
    科学家们从科学技术的角度来阐明苏联发射宇宙火箭是一件极其复杂艰巨的工作，是巨大的人力物力和创造性劳动的结晶，是生产力高度发展和各门科学技术达到先进水平的结果。力学家钱学森说，要把这样重的人造行星用这样高速推上太空，这个火箭可以想见是一个庞然大物。所以这件事在工程技术上说来是非常艰巨的，它的劳动量是极为巨大的。钱学森认为苏联选择了下弦月的时期向月球方向发射宇宙火箭，可见苏联原是有意识地使这支火箭成为围太阳转的新行星。他认为：从动力和控制方面说，苏联已有可能放火箭到火星上去。物理学家周培源说，宇宙火箭要求合金材料、燃料和控制三个方面都达到极高的水平，这三个方面牵涉到复杂的科学技术，所以苏联发射宇宙火箭是它的科学技术全面发展的高度水平的标志。中国科学技术协会副主席茅以升说，劳动可以创造世界，现在苏联人民的劳动还创造出了行星。
    发言的人强调指出，苏联发射宇宙火箭，也是推动和鼓舞中国人民加速社会主义建设的强大动力，他们纷纷表示要更好地学习苏联，艰苦奋斗，为伟大祖国的建设贡献更大的力量。北京第一机床厂工人、北京市工业劳动模范常恩山，丰台机务段中苏友好号机车司机组长周锡铭，北京市郊区中苏友好社主任马风山等人，都表示衷心感谢苏联人民对人类幸福所做出的伟大贡献，他们提出要在自己的岗位上，用实际行动来祝贺苏联人民的胜利。常恩山说，苏联人民对我们的工业建设给予了伟大的援助，我们工人阶级一定要好好学习苏联，在工业战线上作出成绩，完成1959年的任务，以此来感谢苏联人民。周锡铭谈到他们司机组在听到这个消息的那天，马上就开会讨论了自己的跃进计划，提出今后要多拉快跑，更好地完成运输任务。马风山说，我们农民衷心向往苏联人民的伟大成就，在1959年，我们要鼓足更大的干劲，在农业上争取更大的丰收，争取共产主义的美好生活早日到来。共青团中央书记处书记刘西元说，中国青年的兴奋心情是无法形容的，苏联的成就，表明东风吹遍了全世界，青年们都提出要以苏联青年为学习的榜样，更努力地学习，在攀登科学高峰上为祖国作出贡献。李德全和史良都谈到，中国人民和中国妇女，要在各个战线上加速建设，在各个建设岗位上做出更大的贡献。李德全还特别提到，今后要更好地学习苏联，搞好建设，使中国人民生活得更好，建设人人快乐人人健康的幸福生活。
    中苏友协总会秘书长钱俊瑞在会上提出要更好地加强中苏友协的工作，发展中苏友谊。钱俊瑞说，苏联成功地发射宇宙火箭，再一次证明了社会主义制度的无比优越，表现了苏联共产党的英明和伟大，他建议全国人民要好好学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的精神，学习他们的创造力和实事求是精神，并且进一步加强中苏两国人民的友谊。
    郭沫若在座谈会结束的时候说，苏联发射宇宙火箭，绝不单纯是科学技术上的事情，而是整个苏联建设事业的检阅，表明苏联各方面建设都已取得了伟大的成就。他认为这些成就是苏联共产党的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。郭沫若说，我们学习苏联，首先要在各种工作中坚持政治挂帅，以红带专，发扬集体主义，发扬协作精神；其次，要学习他们那种切切实实、埋头苦干的老实态度，学习他们的革命热情和科学分析相结合的精神，把我们的国家建设得更好。
    座谈会最后一致通过了致苏中友协和苏联科学院的祝贺电。
    在会上发言和书面发言的还有沈雁冰、季方、曹靖华、王之相、王芸生、严希纯、张子事、张炳光等人。（附图片）
