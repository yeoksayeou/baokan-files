Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 2nd: Soviet scientists are looking forward to the new year with boundless excitement. Several prominent scientists have given inspiring interviews to TASS reporters.

    Academician Topchiev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said when talking about the prospects of chemical research that the issue of using polymers to directly make cloth or even ready-made clothing without the processes of spinning and weaving has already been raised. Scientists are close to creating pure inorganic polymers with the plasticity of organic polymers. In the future, it will also be possible to synthesize polymer systems that have the properties of living proteins and can transmit chemical reaction energy over long distances. This prospect is extremely attractive. If it is synthesized, it will be a great scientific achievement.
    Topchiev said that the past year has laid all the necessary preconditions for the further development of Soviet chemical science. The central task of Soviet chemists will be to study the process of polymerization. We expect to obtain some interesting and important results in areas such as petrochemical synthesis.
    It can be stated with complete certainty that polymers with a wide variety of different properties will become one of the most powerful tools for technological progress in the Soviet Union. It is possible to achieve achievements even in areas that seem inconceivable at present.
    Academician Andreyev, Chairman of the Acoustics Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, talked about the issue of controlling machines with sound, saying that in the future it will definitely be possible for people to operate machines according to what they say simply by moving their mouths. There are no fundamental difficulties with this now. The only question is the number of words and commands that must be transmitted to the machine.
    He said that Soviet scientists are now looking for ways to eliminate strong industrial noise that damages the human nervous system. The possibility of eliminating even extremely strong sound sources is becoming increasingly apparent.
    Emanuel, Deputy Director of the Institute of Chemical Physics, said that in the new year we will continue to study a very important issue - the physical and chemical mechanisms of cancer. The research in this area, which began in 1958 in collaboration with biologists, has already achieved the first positive results: in experiments using mice, the carcinogenic process was inhibited using negative catalysts—inhibitors.
    Academician Dorodnitsyn, Director of the Computing Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that 1959 will be a year in which electronic computing technology will be strengthened and integrated into all scientific departments. Some computing centers are being equipped with fast electronic computers; some of these will have calculation speeds that greatly exceed 10,000 arithmetic operations per second. With the establishment of powerful computing technology, mathematicians will face increasingly complex new tasks.
    He also pointed out that atomic dynamics is advancing by leaps and bounds, and new, more economical and reliable nuclear reactors are expected to appear.
    Academician Azimovich, Head of the Department of Physical Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the most important achievement in 1958 was that the energy of the synchrophasotron of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research reached 10 billion electron volts. The foundation for further research on the strong interaction of elementary particles has been successfully laid. It is very likely that the first fruits will be borne in this area in 1959 - the discovery of new elementary particles and antiparticles.
    He also said that in 1959, some new devices with different systems will be used to study controlled thermonuclear reactions. These devices can be used to clarify the physical properties of the atomic nuclear fusion process and solve the problem of the possibility of controlling thermonuclear reactions.
    Theoretical physicist Landau said that in recent years many significant events have occurred in the physics community. The discovery of the lack of mirror symmetry in elementary particles is one of the most noteworthy events. The achievements of 1959 will obviously not be few. It is very likely that in this year the theory of elementary particles, which all theoretical physicists dream of, will be established.

    苏联科学家展望苏联科学发展前景
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学家怀着无限兴奋的心情展望新的一年。一些著名科学家向塔斯社记者发表了振奋人心的谈话。
    苏联科学院副院长托普切夫院士在谈到化学研究的前景时说，现在已经提出了不经过纺和织的过程，用聚合物直接制成布甚至制成现成衣服的问题。科学家们已经接近于制成带有有机聚合物塑性的纯无机聚合物。今后还可能合成一些聚合物体系，使它们拥有活蛋白质性质，能够远距离传送化学反应能。这种前景是极诱人的。如果合成了，这将是一项极伟大的科学成就。
    托普切夫说，过去的一年已经为苏联化学科学的进一步发展建立了一切必要的前提。苏联化学家的中心工作将是研究聚合作用过程。我们指望在诸如石油化学合成方面获得一些有兴趣的、重要的结果。
    可以完全有把握地断定，拥有各种极不相同的性能的聚合物，将成为苏联技术进步方面最强有力的工具之一。甚至在目前看来是不可思议的领域中取得成就也是可能的。
    苏联科学院声学委员会主席安德烈耶夫院士谈到用声音控制机器的问题，他说，在将来一定可以做到，人只要动动嘴巴，机器就会按照他说的话去动作，现在这已经没有什么原则性困难了。问题只在于必须传达给机器的词汇和命令的数量。
    他说，现在苏联科学家正在寻找消除损害人的神经系统的强烈工业噪音的方法。消除甚至极强烈的声源的可能性正日益显露出来。
    物理化学研究所副所长埃马努埃尔说，在新的一年中我们将继续研究一项极重要的问题——癌症的物理化学机制。1958年同生物学家共同开始的这方面的研究，已经取得了第一批肯定结果：在利用老鼠进行的实验中，用负催化剂——阻化剂抑制了癌化过程。
    苏联科学院计算中心主任多罗德尼秦院士说，1959年将是电子计算技术加强进入一切科学部门的一年。一些计算中心正在装备快速电子计算机；其中有一些计算速度将大大超过每秒一万次算术运算。随着强大的计算技术的建立，数学家们将面临着日益复杂的新任务。
    他还指出，原子动力学正在大步前进，预计将出现新的、更加经济和可靠的核反应堆。
    苏联科学院物理数学部负责人阿齐莫维奇院士说，1958年最重要的成就就是联合原子核研究所的同步稳相加速器的能量达到了一百亿电子伏特。进一步研究基本粒子强相互作用的基础已经成功地奠定了。很可能，1959年在这方面将结出第一批果实——发现新的基本粒子和反粒子。
    他又说，1959年在研究可控制热核反应方面将使用一些不同系统的新装置，这些装置可以用来阐明原子核聚变过程的物理特性，解决有关控制热核反应可能性的问题。
    理论物理学家兰道院士说，近几年物理学界发生了许多有重要意义的事件。基本粒子缺乏镜称的发现，是最引人注意的事件之一。1959年的成就显然也不会少。很可能在这一年将建立起所有理论物理学家梦寐以求的基本粒子理论。
