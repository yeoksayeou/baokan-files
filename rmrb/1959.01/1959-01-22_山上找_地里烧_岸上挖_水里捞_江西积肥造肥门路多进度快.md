　　Jiangxi Accumulates and Produces Fertilizer with Many Methods and Rapid Progress
　　Nanchang, January 21st (By our newspaper) – Jiangxi Province, from leaders to the masses, is vigorously promoting fertilizer accumulation and production, with many methods, good quality, and rapid progress. Up to now, the province has accumulated and produced more than 8 billion dan of various fertilizers, an increase of more than four times compared with the same period last year. Calculated by cultivated land area, each mu of land has an average of 200 dan of fertilizer. Moreover, these fertilizers are mostly processed and refined farm manure and indigenous chemical fertilizers, with very good fertilizer efficiency.
　　This year, the grain and other crop yields of people's communes in Jiangxi Province will be greatly increased compared with last year. To achieve a greater leap forward, more and better fertilizers are needed. For this reason, starting in November, the entire province launched a vigorous fertilizer accumulation and production campaign to prepare "grain" for the land. During the movement, leaders and the masses worked together, with everyone's enthusiasm soaring. Currently, nearly two million people across the province are involved in fertilizer accumulation and production. People proposed: "Rely on the mountains to find mountains, rely on the water to find water," and adopted various methods such as "searching in the mountains, shoveling on the plains, sweeping at home, picking up outside, digging on the banks,撈撈撈捞捞, and burning in the fields" to accumulate and produce fertilizer. The 320,000-strong fertilizer accumulation army of various people's communes in Yichun Prefecture formed various specialized fertilizer accumulation teams to vigorously burn fire-soil ash, smoke soil blocks, dig pond and lake mud, and shovel surface soil. Poyang, Yujiang, Duchang and other counties along Poyang Lake, in mountainous areas, went up the mountains to cut thatch and sweep fallen leaves; in lakeside areas, they went down to the lake to collect lake grass, with thousands of boats making a big splash in Poyang Lake. A "water army expedition fertilizer accumulation team" of 962 people from Sanmiaoqian People's Commune in Boyang County collected more than 22,000 dan of lake grass in just two days. In Nancheng, Linchuan and other counties in Fuzhou Prefecture, people's communes, according to the strength of the labor force, divided the work and were responsible for "six cleanings," namely: cleaning the field ridges, carrying away pond mud, clearing ditches, sweeping in front of and behind houses, carrying away pig and cattle pen manure, and emptying manure cellars, forming a mass movement in which everyone accumulated fertilizer and everyone produced fertilizer. After Anfu County in Ji'an Prefecture pioneered "smothered fertilizer" in the fields, it was quickly promoted throughout the prefecture. "Smothered fertilizer" is also called "fire-burned fields," which involves digging pits about two feet deep in the fields, making a cross-shaped ditch for ventilation at the bottom of the pit, piling firewood on the ditch, adding thatch on the firewood, covering the thatch with turf, and finally covering the top layer with soil shoveled from the fields. This creates a circular kiln, which is lit to burn and smother into fire-soil. Generally, one kiln can burn about 1,000 dan of fire-soil. If there are several kilns in one field, the field soil can be burned completely once. According to scientific department analysis, this kind of "smothered fertilizer" in the fields has very good fertilizer efficiency, with two or three dan equivalent to one dan of cattle pen manure. This fertilizer accumulation method achieves a combination of fertilizer accumulation, deep plowing, and pest control. In order to improve the quality of fertilizer, field composting was also widely promoted in various places. Composting ponds and composting cellars were dug in the fields, and various natural fertilizers and farm manure were placed in the cellars, stirred, and then sealed with mud to make them rot and increase fertilizer efficiency. Many areas have already achieved having a pond for every mound and a cellar for every section. In addition, people's communes in various places have broken superstitions, worked hard and cleverly, and have manufactured more than 100 kinds of indigenous chemical fertilizers, establishing 28,229 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants. The province has now produced more than 60 million dan of indigenous chemical fertilizers.
　　In the fertilizer accumulation movement, various places also vigorously carried out tool reforms, creating and promoting a large number of fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools, greatly improving fertilizer accumulation efficiency.
　　The reason why the fertilizer accumulation movement in Jiangxi Province is progressing so quickly and well is mainly due to grasping the following links: First, strengthening leadership, mobilizing the masses, and getting everyone involved. Many areas believed that after vigorously accumulating fertilizer last year, there would not be much fertilizer source this year, and they did not mobilize the masses to actively and proactively find ways and think of methods. In response to this idea, various places organized debates to make everyone realize the importance of fertilizer accumulation in ensuring this year's increased production, thereby mobilizing everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions. As a result, various methods such as cutting in the mountains, shoveling on the plains, and burning in the fields emerged, proving that the fertilizer source was not non-existent, but abundant. Second, rationally arrange the labor force, establish specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, and establish a fertilizer accumulation responsibility system. In various winter productions, various places generally arranged 30% of the labor force to engage in fertilizer accumulation and production, and organized specialized fertilizer accumulation and production teams according to the strength of the labor force and technology, establishing a "four-determination" fertilizer accumulation responsibility system and a bonus system for exceeding the quota, i.e., fixed people, fixed time, fixed task, and fixed quality. This ensured the fertilizer accumulation work and improved the responsibility and labor enthusiasm of the members. For example, the Party committee of Xujia People's Commune in Nancheng County, according to the fertilizer accumulation projects, divided 3,000 people into 57 specialized teams according to labor strength and technology, and established a "four-determination" responsibility system, so that the labor was organized and orderly, and the members had a clear understanding of the assigned tasks. A heated fertilizer accumulation competition was launched between teams and individuals, and the daily fertilizer accumulation progress increased rapidly from 85,000 dan in the past to 138,000 dan. Third, grasping the tool reform of fertilizer accumulation and transportation. This is an important method to save labor, improve labor efficiency, and speed up fertilizer accumulation. Fourth, attaching equal importance to quantity and quality, universally achieving: combining the opening up of natural fertilizer sources with processing and refining; combining the large accumulation of natural fertilizers and farm manure with the large-scale production of indigenous chemical fertilizers.

    山上找　地里烧　岸上挖　水里捞
    江西积肥造肥门路多进度快
    本报南昌21日电　江西省从领导到群众大抓肥料，积肥造肥门路多、质量好、速度突飞猛进。到现在止，全省已积造各种肥料八十多亿担，比去年同期增加四倍以上，按耕地面积计算平均每亩田已有肥料二百担。而且这些肥料大都是加工精制了的农家肥和土化肥，肥效很好。
    今年江西省各地人民公社的粮食和其他作物产量都将比去年有很大增加。实现更大的跃进需要更多更好的肥料。为此，从11月份起，全省即掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的为土地备“粮”的积肥造肥运动。运动中领导、群众一齐动手，人人干劲冲天。目前全省近二百万人投入了积肥造肥。人们提出：“靠山找山，靠水找水”，采取了“山上找、平地铲、家里扫、外面拣、岸上挖、水里捞、地里烧”等多种多样的办法积肥造肥。宜春专区各人民公社的三十二万积肥大军，组成了各种积肥专业队，大搞烧火土灰、熏土块、挖塘湖泥、铲地皮泥。鄱阳湖畔的波阳、余江、都昌等县，靠山地区上山割茅草、扫落叶；滨湖地区下湖打捞湖草，千舟万船大闹鄱阳湖。波阳县三庙前人民公社一支九百六十二人的“水军远征积肥队”，两天即打捞湖草二万二千多担。抚州专区的南城、临川等县各人民公社，按劳动力强弱分工负责进行“六光”，即：田埂铲光、塘泥担光、阴沟清光、屋前屋后扫光、猪牛栏担光、粪窖挖光，形成了人人积肥、个个造肥的群众运动。吉安专区的安福县首创田间“焖肥”后，迅速在全专区推广开来。“焖肥”也称“火烧田”，是在田间挖深约二尺左右的坑，坑底做一通风的十字沟，沟上堆柴，柴上加茅草，茅草上盖草皮，最上面盖一层在田里铲的土。这样堆成一个圆形的窑，点火燃烧焖成火土。一般一窑可烧火土千担左右。如一田数窑，即能把田土全部烧一次。这种田间“焖肥”，根据科学部门化验分析，肥效很好，两、三担可抵一担牛栏粪。这种积肥方法做到了积肥、深耕、除虫三结合。为了提高肥料的质量，各地还普遍推行了田间沤肥，在田头挖沤肥池、沤肥窖，把各种自然肥料和农家肥料放在窖内搅拌之后用泥巴加以密闭，使之腐烂增加肥效。许多地区已经做到了丘丘有池、段段有窖。此外，过去不能制造的化学肥料，现在各地人民公社破除迷信，苦学巧干，已经制造出一百多种土化肥，建立起了两万八千二百二十九个土化肥厂。现在全省已生产土化肥六千多万担。
    在积肥运动中，各地还大搞工具改革，创造和推广了大量的积肥运肥工具，大大提高了积肥效率。
    江西省积肥运动所以进行得又快又好，主要是抓住了以下几个环节：一、加强领导，发动群众，人人动手。许多地区认为去年大搞积肥以后今年肥源不多了，不去发动群众积极主动地找门路、想办法。针对这种思想，各地通过组织辩论，使大家认识到积肥对保证今年增产的重要意义，从而发动大家献计、献策。结果山上砍、平地铲、地里烧等各种办法都出来了，证明肥源不是没有，而是很多。二、合理安排劳动力，建立积肥专业队，建立积肥责任制。各地在各项冬季生产中一般都安排了30％的劳动力从事积肥造肥，并按劳动力的强弱和技术组成各种积肥造肥的专业队，建立了定人、定时间、定任务、定质量的“四定”积肥责任制和超额奖励制度。这样就使积肥工作有了确切保证，同时提高了社员的责任心和劳动积极性。如南城县徐家公社党委会根据积肥的项目，按劳力强弱和技术将三千人分别组成五十七个专业队，并确定了“四定”责任制，使劳动作到有条不紊，社员对分配任务的要求明确，并在队与队、人与人之间开展热烈的积肥竞赛，每天积肥进度便由过去的八万五千担迅速增加到了十三万八千担。三、抓积肥、运肥的工具改革。这是节省劳力、提高劳动效率、加快积肥速度的重要方法。四、量与质并重，普遍做到；开辟自然肥源与加工精制相结合；大积自然肥、农家肥与大造土化肥相结合。
