    Broad Masses of Farmers Enthusiastically Embark on the Socialist Road
    Vietnamese Agricultural Cooperativization Movement Surges
    Number of Cooperatives Established Last Year Exceeded Original Plan Many Times Over
    (Reported by this newspaper) Currently, in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the movement to establish agricultural cooperatives is unfolding enthusiastically and rapidly among farmers in various provinces. Whether in the plains or mountainous rural areas, agricultural cooperatives are springing up like mushrooms after rain.
    According to the plan of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it was originally planned to establish 240 agricultural cooperatives in North Vietnam by the end of 1958. However, due to the rapid increase in the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers after the land reform, in just a few months leading up to the end of 1958, 4,721 agricultural cooperatives had already been established in the rural areas of North Vietnam, a number many times higher than originally planned.
    The enthusiasm of the masses of farmers in various localities to establish agricultural cooperatives is unprecedentedly high. They actively participate in learning about the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. In Ha Dong province, when some responsible comrades from the provincial Party committee came to a certain rural area, letters from farmers requesting the establishment of cooperatives flew to them. In a certain area of Phu Tho province, the responsible comrades initially worried that too many farmers would participate in the cooperative, making it difficult to lead them all at once, and claimed that they were organizing advanced cooperatives, thereby making it easier to control the number of participating households. However, when the farmers understood the situation of the advanced cooperatives, it instead formed a surge of the entire village participating in the advanced cooperative.
    In some places, farmers worried that higher authorities would not approve their establishment of cooperatives, so they actually organized cooperatives automatically and still named the cooperatives as mutual aid teams.
    Currently, the agricultural cooperativization movement is continuing to develop under the inspiration of the Three-Year Plan recently passed by the National Assembly of Vietnam.

    广大农民热烈走上社会主义道路
    越南农业合作化运动高涨
    去年建社数目超过原订计划许多倍
    本报讯　目前，在越南民主共和国，建立农业合作社的运动正以极快的速度在各省农民中热烈展开。无论在平原或山区农村，农业合作社犹如雨后春笋，纷纷出现。
    根据越南民主共和国政府的计划，原来准备到1958年底止，在越南北方建立二百四十个农业合作社。但是，由于广大农民群众在土地改革后政治觉悟和生产热情的迅速提高，在截至1958年底的短短几个月时间，越南北方农村就已建立了四千七百二十一个农业合作社，这个数目超过原计划许多倍。
    各地农民群众要求成立农业合作社的热情是空前高涨的。他们积极地参加有关成立农业合作社的学习。在河东省，当一些省委负责同志来到某地农村的时候，农民要求成立合作社的信件就纷纷飞到他们的面前。富寿省某地负责同志起初耽心参加合作社的农民太多，一下间不易领导，扬言所组织的是高级社，借此易于控制参加的农户数目，但当农民了解高级社的情况后，反而形成全村参加高级社的热潮。
    在某些地方，农民耽心上级不批准他们成立合作社，因而在实际上自动组织了合作社后仍把合作社命名为变工队。
    目前，农业合作化运动在越南国会不久前通过的三年计划的鼓舞下，正在继续发展。
