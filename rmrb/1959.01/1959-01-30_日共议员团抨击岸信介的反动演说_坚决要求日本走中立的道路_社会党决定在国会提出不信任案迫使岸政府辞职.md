Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, Tokyo Dispatch: According to a report in today's "Akahata" newspaper, the Japanese Communist Party Diet Members' Group issued a statement on the 28th regarding Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's policy speech, pointing out that Kishi Nobusuke still insists on a policy of hostility towards socialist countries and has not only failed to reflect on his hostile policy towards China but instead wants to shift the responsibility to China.

The statement pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's attacks on Japan's neutral policy show that he fears the Japanese people's urgent demand to take a neutral path.

The statement further pointed out that all of this shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is still resolutely implementing the policy of subservience to the United States centered on revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," according to the plans arranged by U.S. imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups, further dragging Japan onto the road of military alliance.

The statement emphasized that as long as the Japanese people, based on the victory in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," further strengthen unity, launch struggles, and closely cooperate with the people of Asian countries, Japan's neutrality will certainly be realized.

The statement called on all Japanese people to expose the reactionary intentions of the Kishi Nobusuke government and to fight to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Xinhua News Agency, January 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese newspapers today issued a chorus of condemnation against Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke's policy speech.

"Akahata" published an article pointing out that Kishi Nobusuke, in his policy speech, revealed his opposition to Japan's neutrality and his stubborn will to accelerate the negotiations for revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to forcibly revise the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The article pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's speech was under the banner of "peaceful diplomacy," but in reality, it was nothing more than a guise to make Japan further "strengthen its cooperative relationship with the United States."

The "Tokyo Shimbun" published an editorial pointing out that Kishi Nobusuke's speech was empty and deviated from the wishes of the Japanese people.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" today published an article by its editorial bureau advisor, Tatsuo Arai. Arai pointed out that at a time when the Japanese nation is standing at a critical juncture of life and death, Kishi Nobusuke's speech did not provide answers that could satisfy the Japanese people's demands on the two most important issues of this regular Diet session: the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and opening up relations with China.

An article in the "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's speech focused on branding "those who are skeptical of the two major political parties," "neutralists," and "labor movements" with the crime of being "anti-democratic," which carries the danger of leading to a "pre-war state." The newspaper pointed out that when Kishi Nobusuke finished his speech, only scattered applause came from the Liberal Democratic Party members, and even the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party showed indifference.

Xinhua News Agency, January 29th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japan Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejirō Asanuma told reporters in Shizuoka today that the Socialist Party intends to submit a motion of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet before the end of the deliberations on the Japanese 1959 budget draft at the end of February.

Asanuma went to Shizuoka Prefecture to support the Socialist Party candidate running for governor. He said that Kishi Nobusuke has not yet assumed the responsibility he should bear for illegally extending the session of the extraordinary Diet to forcibly pass the amendment to the "Police Duties Execution Law." He also said that within the Liberal Democratic Party, the atmosphere of opposition to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is growing stronger.

Asanuma said that the Socialist Party intends to force the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to resign en masse and form an election management cabinet to dissolve the Diet by introducing a motion of no confidence.

    日共议员团抨击岸信介的反动演说
    坚决要求日本走中立的道路
    社会党决定在国会提出不信任案迫使岸政府辞职
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党国会议员团28日就岸信介首相的施政演说发表声明指出，岸信介仍然要坚持敌视社会主义国家的政策，对于它敌视中国的政策不仅没有进行反省，反而想把责任推给中国。
    声明指出，岸信介所以要攻击日本中立的政策，这表明他害怕日本人民迫切要求走中立道路。
    声明进一步指出，这一切事情表明，岸信介政府仍然在按照美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团排好的计划坚决执行以修改日美“安全条约”为中心的屈从美国的政策，进一步把日本拖上军事同盟的道路。
    声明强调指出，只要日本人民以在反对修改“警察官职务执行法”斗争中获得胜利的基础上，进一步加强团结，展开斗争，并且同亚洲各国人民紧密合作，日本的中立必能实现。
    声明号召全体日本人民揭穿岸信介政府的反动意图，并且为打倒岸信介政府而奋斗。
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本报纸今天对岸信介首相的施政演说发出了一片谴责声。
    “赤旗报”发表文章指出，岸信介在施政演说中表明他反对日本中立，并且要加紧进行修改日美“安全条约”的谈判和强行修改“警察官职务执行法”的顽固意志。
    文章指出，岸信介在演说中打着“和平外交”的旗号，其实这不外是要使日本进一步“加强同美国的合作关系”的外衣罢了。
    “东京新闻”发表社论指出，岸信介的演说内容空虚，背离了日本人民的愿望。
      “每日新闻”今天刊登了它的编辑局顾问新井达夫的文章。新井指出，当日本民族站在生死关头的时候，岸信介的演说对这次国会平时会议中最重要的日美“安全条约”和打开日中关系两个问题，没有作出能够答复日本人民要求的回答。
    “朝日新闻”的文章指出，岸信介演说着重给“对两大政党抱怀疑者”和“中立主义者”以及“劳动运动”冠以“反民主”罪名，这种做法有通往“战前状态”的危险。这家报纸指出，在岸信介结束演说时，只有从自由民主党议员中传出零落的掌声，连自由民主党内的“反主流派”也表现冷淡。
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天在静冈向新闻记者发表谈话说，社会党打算在2月底审议日本1959年度预算草案工作结束之前对岸信介内阁提出不信任案。
    浅沼到静冈县是为了声援社会党人竞选知事。他说，岸信介对于为了强行通过“警察官职务执行法”修正案而非法延长临时国会会期的问题，直到现在还没有承担他应负的责任。他还说，在自由民主党内部，反对岸信介内阁的气氛越来越浓厚。
    浅沼说，社会党打算通过提出不信任案的办法来迫使岸信介内阁总辞职，成立选举管理内阁来解散国会。
