    Seeing the Dawn of Communism
    Old Bolsheviks Overjoyed
    Over a Hundred People Jointly Write a Letter Congratulating the Party Congress
    Moscow Dispatch, January 27th: The Soviet "Pravda" published on the 27th a congratulatory letter to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, jointly written by one hundred and eighty-nine Old Bolsheviks with forty to sixty years of Party membership. In the letter, they congratulated the congress and expressed their extreme joy at being able to see the dawn of communism in the Soviet Union.
    The letter said that in the face of the glorious victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Party, the political bankruptcy of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who were divorced from life, became even more apparent. They attempted to undermine the implementation of the Leninist policies formulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU. After unanimously condemning and crushing this shameful factional group, our glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union has strengthened its ranks even more powerfully.
    The letter mentioned the remarkable achievements made by the Soviet people in all aspects of economy and culture over the past year. The letter said that the Soviet state is entering a period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society, entering a period of establishing the material and technical foundation of communism, during which the historically significant task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output will be practically solved.
    These Old Bolsheviks continued in their congratulatory letter, saying that as representatives of the most advanced class in modern society, as advocates of the most progressive social system, communists are not interested in war. They know that the superiority of the socialist system can be most fully demonstrated under peaceful development conditions. The achievements made by the Soviet Union in building a new life are based on the Leninist foreign policy of peace consistently implemented by the Party and the government.
    The letter concluded by saying that we Old Bolsheviks are welcoming the historically significant 21st Congress of the Party with extreme pride. Under the wise leadership of the Leninist Central Committee, Lenin's great cause is constantly winning victories.

    看到了共产主义的曙光
    老布尔什维克无限喜悦
    一百余人联名写信祝贺党代会
    本报莫斯科27日电　苏联“真理报”27日刊登了一百八十九位有四十到六十多年党龄的老布尔什维克写给苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的一封贺信。他们在信中祝贺代表大会，并对他们能够在苏联看到共产主义的曙光而表示万分高兴。
    信中说，苏联人民在党的领导下取得辉煌胜利的情况下，可以更明显地看出脱离生活的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的政治破产，他们企图破坏苏共第二十次代表大会所制定的列宁主义方针的实现。在一致谴责并粉碎了这个可耻的派别分子集团之后，我们光荣的苏联共产党更加有力地加强了自己的队伍。
    信中谈到了苏联人民一年来在经济和文化各方面所取得的卓越成就。信中说，苏维埃国家正在进入全面展开共产主义社会建设时期，进入建立共产主义物质技术基础的时期，在这个时期内将要实际解决具有历史意义的任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    这些老布尔什维克在贺信中接着说，作为现代社会最先进的阶级的代表，作为最进步的社会制度的拥护者的共产党人，对战争是不感兴趣的。他们知道，在和平发展的条件下才能最充分地显示社会主义制度的优越性。苏联在建设新生活中所取得的成就是以党和政府一贯执行的列宁主义和平外交政策为基础的。
    信中最后说，我们老布尔什维克怀着极其骄傲的心情迎接党的具有历史意义的第二十一次代表大会。在列宁主义的中央委员会的英明领导下列宁的伟大事业正在不断获得胜利。
