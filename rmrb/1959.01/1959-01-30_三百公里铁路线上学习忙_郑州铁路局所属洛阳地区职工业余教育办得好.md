Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 29th: The relevant units in the Luoyang area under the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, relying on the masses to run schools, have comprehensively launched spare-time education for staff and workers along the railway line, which stretches three hundred kilometers from east to west. At present, this area has successively established eleven spare-time schools and thirty-three branch schools. These spare-time schools offer primary, junior high, and senior high school classes, and individual spare-time schools have also established university classes. 5,722 people are participating in learning, accounting for 97.3% of the total number of employees in various factories, sections, and stations. Veteran workers mainly study basic cultural knowledge, combined with necessary technical learning; new workers mainly study technology, combined with learning necessary cultural knowledge.

　　In the past two months, the schools, in response to the complex nature of railway enterprise work types, have created several teaching forms suitable for spare-time schools. For day-shift workers with fixed production schedules, a "six-three" system of class teaching is adopted; for shift workers, the potential of labor organization is tapped, and the daily three-shift cycle system is changed to a four-shift cycle. In addition to two day and night shifts for production and one shift for rest, one shift is rotated out for learning; for a small number of workers scattered along the line with unfixed work, they are concentrated at the designated Gongxian, Mianchi, and Lingbao stations for two days of learning each week, with the remaining four days for production; for drivers, stokers, conductors, and attendants who are constantly on the move, teaching is conducted on the train, with teachers traveling with the train and carrying books with them.

　　The Luoyang area of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau adheres to the principle of making education and production a unified system in carrying out spare-time education for staff and workers. Factory, section, and station chiefs serve as school principals, and the Party committees and general branches of each unit also serve as the Party committees and general branches of each school. Workshop directors are the department heads of the schools, production team leaders are the heads of the study classes, and production group leaders are the study group leaders.

　　Two months of experience have proven that when production and education are unified, vigorously developing spare-time education for staff and workers not only does not hinder production, but also greatly enhances the workers' awareness of the Party's concern for them and their communist consciousness, bringing into full play their labor enthusiasm. They automatically adjust production organization, engage in mutual assistance and cooperation, and ensure good production. Last December, while actively participating in spare-time learning, the workers in this area completed 113.2% of the monthly car loading plan and 135.2% of the monthly car unloading plan. The locomotive section's coal saving plan and the track maintenance of the track section, along with eight major production targets, were all completed and overfulfilled. In the first twenty days of January this year, the entire area's car loading task had already been overfulfilled. Mechanization and semi-mechanization have been achieved in loading and unloading and road maintenance throughout the district. After studying and improving their cultural level, the senior high school class of the telecommunications section successfully trial-produced the locomotive signal light, which was planned to be trial-produced by the end of this year, ahead of schedule on January 10.

　　These schools have more than five hundred teachers. In addition to full-time teachers, the rest are part-time teachers selected from cadres, technicians, and workers through a combination of "mass selection, leadership approval" and "leadership designation, mass evaluation." Among them, there are two hundred and eight veteran workers. These teachers and the vast number of employees eat, live, and work together, and when lecturing, they can combine book knowledge with labor practice.

    三百公里铁路线上学习忙
    郑州铁路局所属洛阳地区职工业余教育办得好
    新华社郑州29日电　郑州铁路局所属洛阳地区有关单位依靠群众办学，在东西长达三百公里的铁路线上全面开展职工业余教育。目前，这个地带已经先后建立了十一所业余学校和三十三所分校。在这些业余学校中，设有小学、初中、高中等班次，个别业余学校还设立了大学班。有五千七百二十二人参加学习，占各厂、段、站职工总数的97.3％。职工中的老工人以学习文化基础知识为主，结合必要的技术学习；新工人以学习技术为主，结合学习必要的文化知识。
    两个月来，各校针对铁路企业工种复杂的特点，创造了好几种适合业余学校的教学形式。对生产固定的日勤制工人，采用“六三”制的班级教学；对轮班制的工人，挖掘劳动组织潜力，由每日三班循环制改为四班循环，每天除日夜两班搞生产、一班休息外，还轮流抽出一班来学习；对分散在沿线工作不固定的少数工种的工人，每星期分别集中到指定的巩县、渑池、灵宝各站进行两天学习，其余四天生产；对常年流动的司机、司炉、车长、乘务员，采取教学上列车，教师随车走，随身带书本的形式进行教学。
    郑州铁路局洛阳地区在开展职工业余教育中坚持使教育和生产成为一个统一的体系，各厂、段、站长分别担任学校校长，各单位党委总支也担任各学校的党委总支，车间主任是学校的系主任，生产班长是学习班主任，生产小组长是学习小组长。
    两个月的经验证明：在生产和教育取得统一的时候，大力开展职工业余教育，不但没有妨碍生产；并且，由于职工们深感到党对自己的关怀，和在学习中共产主义的觉悟大大提高，空前发挥了劳动积极性，自动调整生产组织，他们搞互助协作，来保证搞好生产。去年12月份，这个地区的职工在积极参加业余学习的同时，曾完成装车月计划的113.2％，完成卸车月计划的135.2％，机务段节煤计划、工务段的线路维修等八大生产指标，都全部完成和超额完成。今年1月份的头二十天全地区的装车任务已经超额完成。在装卸和养路方面，全区实现了机械化和半机械化。电务段的高中班，经过学习提高文化后，将计划在今年底试制成功的机车信号灯，提前在1月10日试制成功了。
    这些学校有五百多名教师，除专职的以外，其余都是用“群众挑选，领导批准”和“领导指名，群众评定”的上下结合的办法，从干部、技术人员和工人中挑选出来的兼职教员。其中老工人有二百零八名。这些教师和广大职工，同吃同住同劳动，在讲课时，能把书本知识和劳动实践结合起来。
