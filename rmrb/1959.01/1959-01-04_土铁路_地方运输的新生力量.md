Since Meng County in Shanxi Province, and Weiyuan and Zhangye Counties in Gansu Province pioneered the construction of indigenous railways, many places have learned from this experience and started building their own railways. Some provinces have also formulated or are formulating plans for the construction of indigenous railways. Shanxi Province's plan was formulated earlier and implementation started sooner. More than 240 kilometers of indigenous railways are now under full construction throughout the province, and more than 600 kilometers of indigenous railways have begun surveying the terrain. This is of great significance for the development of local economies and the national transportation industry. Indigenous railways are a new force in local transportation. Our local transportation usually relies mainly on automobiles, small freighters, and folk transport tools such as wooden sailboats and animal-drawn carts. Automobiles, small freighters, wooden sailboats, and animal-drawn carts are indeed forces that cannot be ignored in local transportation, and we must continue to strengthen our work in these areas in the future. Automobile transportation and water transportation should be further developed wherever possible, and folk transport tools should be fully utilized and appropriately developed. However, this alone is not enough to meet the needs of the ever-developing local economy. This has been proven by many facts in the past year.

In the past year, all localities have conscientiously implemented the Party's complete set of policies on developing the economy by walking on two legs, giving play to the positive factors in all aspects, and enabling China's industrial and agricultural production to develop by leaps and bounds. The sound of construction comes not only from a few industrial cities, but also from many poor and remote areas that had no industry in the past. This situation of industry blooming everywhere is reflected in transportation, which requires not only an increase in quantity, but also an expansion of scope, requiring roads to be opened up in places where there were no roads in the past, and transportation forces to be gathered in places where there was no transportation force in the past. In order to meet the requirements of this situation, in the past period, local Party committees, on the one hand, mobilized all existing transportation forces, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to develop a variety of simple, easy-to-implement, and effective transportation methods. Indigenous railways are one of them. This kind of railway paved with tracks cast from molten iron has relatively simple technology, small investment, and can quickly yield results, undertaking a large volume of transportation.

The role of indigenous railways has become clearer in the recent period. In the recent period, as the "small indigenous groups" in the steel industry entered a new stage of rectification, consolidation, and improvement, especially with the construction of many small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and modern methods, the situation of local industrial development has undergone some important changes, that is, from dispersion to relative concentration. This situation places more arduous demands on local transportation departments: the volume of transportation has increased and become more concentrated, requiring a fixed transportation force. Under these circumstances, if we continue to mainly use folk transport tools such as animal-drawn carts, it will inevitably require the frequent concentration of large numbers of manpower and livestock, which is quite difficult. Even if it is possible to concentrate so much manpower and livestock, the roads will be impassable, and the cost will be too high. Indigenous railways can take on this large-scale, regular transportation task and save a lot of labor. For example, the Bagong Red Flag People's Commune in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, built a three-kilometer-long indigenous railway in half a month, which can transport 800 tons of coal to the steel plant every day, basically solving the transportation problem of coal, steel, and other materials, and freeing up more than 800 laborers, 1,000 livestock, and more than 1,000 iron-wheeled carts.

Perhaps some people say: "If we want to build railways, why not build railways with steel rails? Railways with iron rails are too backward!" Yes, railways with steel rails are much more advanced than indigenous railways paved with iron rails, and we are also vigorously building railways with steel rails. However, at present, China's steel rail production is not yet abundant, and we can only use the limited steel rails for the most important transportation lines, and it is not yet possible to build steel rail railways for small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and modern methods in various places. Moreover, these small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and modern methods, compared with scattered steelmaking and ironmaking points, although they are much more concentrated, are still distributed quite widely, and their output is also much smaller than that of large and medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprises. Building steel rail railways for these small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises is not only impossible at present, but also unnecessary.

While building steel rail railways, building indigenous railways paved with iron rails is also a matter of walking on two legs. The policy of walking on two legs is not something that anyone came up with out of thin air. In social life, relatively advanced technology and relatively backward technology always coexist, and indigenous and modern methods always coexist. Without backwardness, there is no so-called advancement; without indigenous, there is no so-called modern. Our Party has only analyzed this social phenomenon, recognized that the coexistence of indigenous and modern methods is an objective law, and thus proposed the policy of promoting both indigenous and modern methods in order to utilize this law. Taking railways as an example, railways in any country in the world are divided into double tracks and single tracks, and also into heavy rails and light rails. Double tracks have a large passing capacity, and heavy rails are more advanced in technology; single tracks have a smaller passing capacity, and light rails are more backward in technology, but they coexist at the same time. Double-track heavy rails are laid on busy sections, and single-track light rails are laid on sections with relatively small traffic volume. No one thinks this is unreasonable. Since it is completely reasonable for railways to be divided into double tracks and single tracks, heavy rails and light rails, why can't there be another distinction between steel rails and iron rails? This distinction is completely reasonable to meet the different requirements of various regions with different traffic volumes, and any idea that despises indigenous railways is incorrect.

The construction of indigenous railways must be connected to the surrounding transportation lines, especially to the surrounding modern railways and transportation trunk lines as much as possible. Transportation is valued for its accessibility. If indigenous railways are not connected to the surrounding transportation lines, especially transportation trunk lines, they cannot achieve unimpeded traffic, and the role of indigenous railways will be greatly limited. As everyone knows, "the whole country is one chessboard," and the development of the local economy cannot be separated from the development of the national economy, and local transportation cannot be separated from the national transportation network. In the past period, the outward transfer of pig iron from various provinces has become a major problem. One of the important reasons is that short-distance transportation lags behind trunk line transportation, and pig iron scattered in the countryside cannot be quickly concentrated on the transportation trunk lines. The construction of indigenous railways should pay attention to solving this problem. As far as the local area is concerned, only by connecting the indigenous railways with modern railways or other transportation trunk lines can the local construction obtain support from other places and make the local economic life pulsate with the national economic life. This requires all localities to consider not only the development of the local economy when planning the layout of indigenous railways, but also the connection with the surrounding transportation lines, especially the connection with transportation trunk lines such as modern railways. Of course, due to some special circumstances, such as remote locations and inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to connect indigenous railways with transportation trunk lines for a while, and it is also not opposed to building only a section of indigenous railway.

The construction of indigenous railways is still a new issue, and we do not have much experience in this area, and we need to continue to improve our understanding and summarize experience from practice. However, the role of indigenous railways is completely certain. Like automobile and train transportation, cableway transportation, wooden rail transportation, and wooden boat towing transportation, they have all been tested in the great practice of economic life in 1958. We must attach importance to this new force and support its development.

The development of China's railway construction industry in recent years has been amazing. However, compared with China's vast territory, the quantity is still too small. If we seize the construction of steel rail railway trunk lines and also vigorously build indigenous railways, we can not only enrich the strength of local transportation and invigorate the development of the local economy, but also form a well-connected railway network throughout the country in a relatively short period of time. What a wonderful prospect this is!

### 土铁路——地方运输的新生力量

    土铁路——地方运输的新生力量
    自从山西省的盂县，甘肃省的渭源、张掖等县创办土铁路以来，许多地方都学习这个经验，自己创办铁路。有些省还制订了或正在制订修建土铁路的规划，其中山西省的规划订得比较早，动手也比较早，现在全省已有两百四十多公里土铁路全面动工，还有六百多公里土铁路已经开始勘测地形。这对于发展地方经济和全国交通运输事业有着重大的意义。土铁路是地方运输中的一支新生力量。我们的地方运输通常主要是依靠汽车、小货轮以及木帆船、骡马大车等民间运输工具来担负的。汽车、小货轮和木帆船、骡马大车等等，固然是地方运输中不可忽视的力量，今后我们在这些方面的工作还要继续加强，在一切有可能的地方，汽车运输和水上运输都要进一步的发展，民间运输工具更应该充分利用起来并适当发展；但是，仅仅这样还是不能适应地方经济日益发展的需要的。这在过去一年中已经被许多事实证明了。
    过去一年中，各地认真贯彻了党所提出的关于发展经济的一整套的两条腿走路的方针，发挥了各个方面的积极因素，使我国的工农业生产突飞猛进地发展，建设的声音不只来自少数工业城市，而且来自许许多多过去毫无工业的穷乡僻壤。这种工业遍地开花的形势，反映在运输上，就不仅是量的增长，而且还要求面的扩大，要求在过去没有道路的地方开辟出道路来，在过去没有运输力量的地方聚结起运输力量来。为了适应这种形势的要求，过去一个时期，各地党委一方面动员了现有的全部运输力量，一方面还发动群众，发展了多种多样简便易行效果显著的运输方式。土铁路就是其中之一。这种用铁水浇铸的轨道铺筑的铁路，技术比较简单，投资小，却能很快地收效，担负起很大的运量。
    土铁路的作用，在最近一个时期看得更加清楚。最近一个时期，随着钢铁工业“小土群”进入整顿、巩固和提高的新阶段，特别是随着许多土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业的建设，地方工业发展的形势又有了一些重要的变化，这就是由分散走向相对的集中。这种形势，给地方运输部门提出了更繁重的要求：运量增加了，集中了，需要有固定的运输力量。在这种情况下，如果继续主要用骡马大车等民间运输工具，势必经常集中大批人力、畜力，这是有相当困难的。即便能集中这么多人力、畜力，道路也走不开，成本也嫌太高。而土铁路却能胜任这种大量的、经常的运输任务，节省大量的劳动力。例如山西省晋城县巴公红旗人民公社，用半个月的时间建成三公里长的土铁路，每天能给钢铁厂运八百吨煤，基本上解决了煤炭和钢铁等物资的运输问题，腾出了八百多个劳动力、一千头牲口和一千多辆铁轮大车。
    也许有人说：“要搞铁路，为什么不搞钢轨的铁路呢？铁轨的铁路太落后了！”是的，钢轨的铁路比铺铁轨的土铁路先进得多，我们也正在大力建设钢轨的铁路。但是，目前我国的钢轨生产还不富裕，我们还只能把有限的钢轨用到最关紧要的运输线路上去，还不可能为各地土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业修建钢轨铁路。何况这些土洋结合的小型钢铁联合企业，同分散的炼钢点、炼铁点比较起来，虽然是集中得多了，但仍然分布得相当广阔，产量也比大中型的钢铁联合企业少得多，为这些小型钢铁联合企业建造钢轨铁路，目前不仅不可能，而且也没有必要。
    在建造钢轨铁路的同时，修建用铁轨铺筑的土铁路，也是一个用两条腿走路的问题。两条腿走路的方针并不是哪一个人凭空想出来的。在社会生活中，比较先进的技术和比较落后的技术总是并存的，土和洋也总是并存的。没有落后，便无所谓先进；没有土，便无所谓洋。我们的党只不过分析了这种社会现象，认识到土洋并存是一种客观规律，从而提出了土洋并举的方针，来利用这个规律。拿铁路来说，世界上任何一个国家的铁路，都有双轨单轨之分，也都有重轨轻轨之分。双轨的通过能力大，重轨在技术上比较先进；单轨的通过能力比较小，轻轨在技术上比较落后，但它们却同时并存着。双轨重轨铺在运输繁忙的地段，单轨轻轨铺在运输量比较小的地段，谁也不认为这是什么不合理的事情。既然铁路有双轨单轨、重轨轻轨之分是完全合理的，为什么不可以再有一种钢轨铁轨之分呢？这种分别适应运量大小不同的各个地区的不同要求，是完全合理的，任何轻视土铁路的想法都是不正确的。
    建造土铁路，一定要同周围的运输线路，特别是要尽可能同周围的洋铁路、同运输干线连结起来。运输，贵在四通八达。土铁路不同周围的运输线路，特别是运输干线联系起来，就不能达到畅通无阻的目的，土铁路的作用也就受到很大的限制。大家知道，“全国一盘棋”，地方经济的发展不能离开全国经济的发展，地方运输也不能同全国的运输网割裂开来。过去一个时期，各省的生铁外调成为一个很大的问题。其中重要原因之一，就是短途运输落后于干线运输，散在四乡的生铁不能很快地集中到运输干线上来。土铁路的建设应该注意到解决这个问题。对于地方说来，也只有把土铁路同洋铁路或其他运输干线连结起来，才能使地方上的建设取得外地的支援，使地方经济生活随着全国经济生活的脉搏一起跳动。这就需要各地在规划土铁路布局的时候，不只考虑到地方经济的发展，而且要考虑到周围运输线路，特别是同洋铁路等运输干线的衔接。当然，由于某些特殊的情况，例如地方偏僻，交通不便等，土铁路一时难于同运输干线连结起来，只能建筑一段土铁路，也是不应该反对的。
    土铁路的建造，还是一个新的问题，我们在这方面的经验还不多，还有待于继续从实践中提高认识，总结经验。但是，土铁路的作用，却是完全可以肯定的。它同汽车列车运输、索道运输，木轨运输、木船拖带运输等一样，都是在1958年经济生活的伟大实践中经受过考验的。我们一定要重视这支新生力量，支持它的发展。
    几年来我国铁路建设事业的发展是惊人的。但是，同我国辽阔的国土比较起来，数量还是太少了。如果在抓紧建设钢轨铁路干线的同时，大办土铁路，就不仅能够充实地方运输的力量，活跃地方经济的发展，而且能够用比较短的时候，在全国范围内形成一个四通八达的铁路网。这是一个多么美好的前景啊！
