Fertilizer and Politics
Ge De
At present, fertilizer needs to "take command." Our Party Central Committee and the State Council have issued instructions to immediately launch a mass movement for accumulating and producing fertilizer. That "manure" once described as "worse than dirt" by refined gentlemen is now of great importance to politics.

In fact, the entire Party and all the people have already begun to mobilize. The Central Committee's demand to immediately launch a mass fertilizer accumulation movement is not only a current need but also has the momentum to succeed. Opening recent newspapers, from national to local, many of the headline titles are about the masses accumulating and transporting fertilizer: "Fertilizer Takes Command to Ensure a Greater Leap Forward in Agriculture, Everyone Takes Action to Solve the Current Urgent Task" (People's Daily), "Everyone Takes Action to Launch a Larger-Scale Fertilizer Accumulation Movement" (Hebei Daily), "Yan'an Prefecture's Mountains and Fields are Filled with Smoke and Boisterous Voices, Over 200,000 People Marching Towards the Fertilizer Great Leap Forward" (Shaanxi Daily), "Golden Abundance Mountain Foot Smoke Billows, Ting River Banks Red Flags Flutter" (Fujian Daily)...

This is exactly what is happening everywhere, regardless of east, west, north, or south, and everyone, regardless of gender or age, is engaged in large-scale fertilizer production. Which of these glorious and brilliant phrases in the newspapers isn't shining brightly and attracting people! In various places, secretaries are taking the lead, personally commanding large armies to direct operations. Provincial Party secretaries inspect fertilizer production, personally handling the problems of human and animal waste. County Party secretaries, county heads, grassroots Party committee secretaries, and numerous cadres personally carry manure baskets and pick up manure. Some places have formed a custom of "everyone going out with a manure basket." As for the vast number of Communist Party members in rural areas, they are even more selflessly striving to seize fertilizer. When a cold wave struck Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, all seven hundred and seventy-two Communist Party members of the Shijiao People's Commune turned out en masse to take the lead in accumulating fertilizer. They took the initiative to jump into the muddy ponds, greatly moving the masses, and actually accumulated more fertilizer than on warmer days.

If we were to talk about the masses' enthusiasm, it would be best to quote folk songs: "Cold winds gusting, rolling red flags, frost flowers fluttering, covering people's clothes, I'm not cold fighting pond mud, I won't give up if the land doesn't offer treasure." "Abundant fertilizer sources on both sides of the Mei River, commune members hoeing up the mountainside, fertilizer piled up to the ninth heaven, blocking the sun, unable to cross the river."

Farmers see fertilizer as even more precious than the sun. We have a story in our village: every time a farmer sends manure to the field, he always says two complimentary sentences: "Land, land, let's work together, you eat what I excrete, I eat what you excrete." Although the sentences are not so elegant, they flow from the farmer's sincere feelings. It is from this feeling that men and women, young and old, have displayed their creative spirit and high enthusiasm: modifying tools, repairing ice roads, "earth airplanes," "mountain cars," etc., are all amazing. Finding fertilizer sources, accumulating and producing more, they have also put forward a thirteen-character formula: planting, making, burning, exchanging, smoking, digging, sweeping, fishing, shoveling, washing, fermenting, piling, picking, truly displaying boundless resourcefulness, beyond the reach of immortals.

Why is this happening?

The answer is: fertilizer is a matter of great importance to socialist construction. This is the main reason why it must "take command." Why should fertilizer take command at present? First, this year we want an even greater leap forward than last year, and to harvest more grain, we must attack fertilizer more vigorously; second, "deep plowing of the land" requires more fertilizer, otherwise, it will be counterproductive; third, "dense planting" means more rice is needed to cook for more people, and more fertilizer is needed to plant more seeds, which is only natural; finally, there is also "limited time and pressing season," with spring plowing just around the corner. In this way, fertilizer has become "a decisive link in striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959." This year's great leap forward in agriculture is related to the progress of the entire socialist construction and the better improvement of the lives of more than 600 million people. The issue of socialist construction and the improvement of the lives of 600 million people is naturally the top political issue.

Moreover, first, the large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement is actually the beginning of a great upsurge in agricultural production in 1959. Now the farmers' emotions are full, their spirits are high, their enthusiasm is soaring, and they are full of ingenuity, which foreshadows a better and greater leap forward this year. Second, this movement is promoting the continuous improvement of the people's commune system, political measures and economic measures have been better coordinated, the good work style of cadres and Party members has been further promoted, and the relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between cadres and the masses have been further improved. All of this is both economic gain and political gain. Looking forward to the whole year, it is truly encouraging and exciting. It is:

Secretaries carry manure baskets one after another,
Rising early and working late, busy accumulating fertilizer;
Smoke and dust billowing, the army and horses move,
Please look at the golden granaries after autumn.

### 肥料和政治

    肥料和政治
    葛德
    当前肥料要“挂帅”，我们党中央和国务院发布指示：立即掀起全民积肥造肥运动。过去流传在雅人君子们口上的“粪土不如”的那“粪”，如今同政治发生重大关系了。
    实际上全党全民早已在开始发动。中央要求的立即掀起全民积肥运动，不仅是当前的需要，而且也有了必成之势。打开最近的报纸，从全国的到地方的，头条大字标题，很多都是关于群众积肥运肥的：“肥料挂帅确保农业更大跃进，人人动手解决当前紧急任务”（人民日报），“人人动手，掀起更大规模的积肥运动”（河北日报），“延安专区满山遍野浓烟四起人声沸腾，二十多万人向肥料大进军”（陕西日报），“金丰山麓烟尘滚滚，汀江两岸红旗飘飘”（福建日报）……
    这正是地不分东西南北，人不分男女老幼，都在大搞肥料。报纸上这些光辉灿烂的字句，哪个不是金光闪闪吸引人心！各地都是书记挂帅，亲自统率大军指挥作战。省委书记视察造肥，亲手处理人畜粪尿的问题。县委书记、县长、基层党委书记、众多干部，亲自背粪筐拾粪。有的地方已形成了一种“人人带粪箕出门”的风气。至于广大农村的共产党员，更是奋不顾身地在争夺肥料。广东省清远县石角人民公社七百七十二名共产党员，在一次寒潮袭来时，全体出动带头积肥。率先跃身入泥塘，使群众大受感动，反而比暖和日子积肥还多。
    倘要谈到群众情绪，最好还是引用民歌：“寒风阵阵卷红旗，霜花飘飘盖人衣，大战塘泥我不冷，地不献宝我不依”。“湄河两岸肥源多，社员荷锄上山坡，肥料堆上九重天，挡住太阳过不了河”。
    农民把肥料看得比太阳还亲。我们乡下有个故事，一个农民每次送粪到地里去的时候，总要说两句赞词：“土地土地，咱俩搭伙计，你吃我屙的，我吃你屙的”。句子虽不那么文雅，但却是从农民的真挚感情中流出的。正是从这种感情出发，男女老少才发挥了创造精神和高度的热情：改工具、修冰道、“土飞机”、“山区汽车”等等无奇不有，找肥源，多积造，还提出了十三字真言，曰：种、造、烧、换、熏、挖、扫、捞、铲、洗、沤、堆、拣，真是神通广大，神仙莫及。
    为什么会这样？
    回答是：积肥事关社会主义建设大计。这就是它要“挂帅”的主要原因。为什么在当前要肥料挂帅呢？一是今年要比去年更大跃进，粮食要更多打，就要多攻肥；二是“土地深翻”，深翻必须多施肥，否则反误事；三是“密植”，人多了作饭就要多下米，籽多了种地就要多施肥，这是理所当然；最后还有一个“时间有限，季节迫人”，春耕就在眼前了。这样，肥成了“争取1959年农业生产更大跃进具有决定性的环节”。今年农业的大跃进，关系着整个社会主义建设事业的进展，关系着六亿多人生活的更好改善。社会主义建设事业和六亿人民的生活改善问题自然就是头等政治问题了。
    何况还有，第一、大规模的积肥运动，实际上是1959年农业生产大高潮的开端，如今农民的情绪饱满，精神奋发，热气冲天，机巧百出，正预示着今年有一个更好更大的跃进局面。二、这个运动正促使人民公社制度不断健全，政治的措施和经济的措施已有了更好的配合，干部和党员的良好作风有了更进一步的发扬，党群关系、干部群众关系有了更进一步的改进。凡此等等，都是既有经济的收获，更有政治的收获。展望全年，实在令人欢欣鼓舞。正是：
      书记纷纷背粪筐，起早摸黑积肥忙；
      烟尘滚滚军马动，秋后请看金谷仓。
