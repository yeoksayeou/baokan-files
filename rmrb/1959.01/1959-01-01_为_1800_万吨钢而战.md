    Fighting for 18 Million Tons of Steel
    Li Shaoqui, Chief Furnace Master of No. 7 Open Hearth Furnace, Anshan Iron and Steel Works First Steel Plant, Anshan City Special-Class Labor Model

    We, the workers of the No. 7 Open Hearth Furnace, along with hundreds of thousands of steelworkers at Anshan Iron and Steel, successfully passed through 1958. In this year, under the leadership of the Party, the No. 7 Open Hearth Furnace overfulfilled the state plan by more than 5,000 tons of steel and won the championship in terms of furnace utilization coefficient in the entire plant. While celebrating this victorious year, our fellow workers are rolling up their sleeves, full of confidence to meet the 1959 battle for 18 million tons of steel. We are willing to compete with steelworkers across the country in this great battle, resolutely loading more, smelting faster, maintaining the furnace body well, increasing output, improving quality, and producing whatever steel the country needs. We strive to become the advanced furnace among the nation's large open hearth furnaces.

    How can we realize our determination? First, we must strengthen the unity of the four shifts. Unity is strength. The main reason for achieving such success in 1958 was the good unity among the four shifts of workers. The workers proposed "five no-goes" when handing over shifts: no leaving with unfinished work, no leaving without repairing the furnace, no leaving without patching the front wall, no leaving without smelting the furnace, and no leaving without tapping the steel. This ensured that each shift left no work behind, creating conditions for the next shift. In this new year, all our furnace workers must continue to be as united as steel to win more steel.

    Second, we must resolutely implement the Party Committee's instructions on mass thermal engineering, mass furnace body maintenance, and mass steelmaking, and rely on the masses to improve production. In the past, only the chief furnace master was involved in furnace smelting, which took a long time. In 1958, the No. 7 furnace spent four and a half hours per hundred hours on furnace smelting; in the future, we need to train every furnace chief to be able to smelt the furnace, reducing the smelting rate to below 3%. Everyone should make outstanding achievements in their positions and learn to direct steelmaking whenever possible. At the same time, the furnace leaders should frequently contact the masses and promptly inform them of the key points of the furnace.

    Third, we must humbly learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal furnaces and continuously improve our operating skills. Not long ago, when some furnaces created fast steelmaking experience, some steelworkers in our furnace were unwilling to learn, thinking that other people's experience was nothing special. After carrying out criticism and self-criticism on this ideology, our furnace achieved an unprecedented record of smelting 340 tons of steel in six hours and forty-five minutes. This fact tells us that we must promptly clear away ideological obstacles and absorb the advanced experiences of others in order to advance further.

    Fourth, like other furnaces in the First Steel Plant, the No. 7 furnace has added many new workers (accounting for 50%) because many old workers have gone to support newly built iron and steel enterprises. Therefore, quickly improving the operating skills of new workers is an important guarantee for winning the battle. In 1959, our plan is to use masters to guide apprentices, with one old worker responsible for training one new worker, so that 50% of the new workers reach the level of an assistant, 30% reach the level of a second assistant, and 20% reach the level of a general skilled worker.

    A year's plan starts in the spring. The workers of our No. 7 Open Hearth Furnace are determined to fight a beautiful battle at the beginning of 1959: guarantee 100% attendance during the New Year holiday, and break the old record in the first two days by creating a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in six hours.

### 为1800万吨钢而战

    为1800万吨钢而战
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂七号平炉总炉长鞍山市特等劳动模范  李绍奎
    我们七号平炉工人们和鞍钢十几万钢铁工人一起胜利地渡过了1958年。这一年，七号平炉在党的领导下，超额五千多吨钢完成了国家计划，夺得了全厂平炉利用系数方面的冠军。在欢送这胜利年的时候，工友们又磨拳擦掌，满怀信心地迎接1959年一千八百万吨钢的战斗，我们愿在这场大战中和全国炼钢工人比武，坚决多装快炼，维护好炉体，增加产量，提高质量，国家要什么钢就炼什么钢，争取做全国大型平炉的先进炉。
    怎样实现我们的决心？第一，要加强四班团结。团结就是力量，1958年所以能取得这样成绩，其中主要原因是四班工人团结得好。工人们提出交班时有活不走，补炉不走，贴前墙不走，炼炉不走，出钢不走等“五不走”，做到了班班不留活，上班给下班创造条件。在这新的一年中，我们全炉工人要继续团结得像钢一样坚固来夺取更多的钢。
    第二，我们要坚决贯彻党委的群众性热工、群众性维护炉体、群众炼钢的指示，依靠群众搞好生产。炼炉方面过去还只是总炉长炼，因此时间较长，1958年七号炉每一百小时有四个半小时用在炼炉上；今后要培养每个炉长都会炼炉，使炼炉率降低到3％以下。人人要在自己的岗位上做出出色成绩，有机会时都学习指挥炼钢。同时炉上的负责人要勤和群众联系，及时向群众交清炉子上的关键。
    第三，虚心学习兄弟炉的先进经验，不断提高操作水平。不久前当有的炉子创造出快速炼钢经验时，我们炉子曾有个别炼钢工不愿学习，认为人家的经验没有什么了不起，后来对这种思想开展批评和自我批评后，我们的炉子便出现了六小时四十五分钟炼出一炉三百四十吨钢的空前纪录。这一事实告诉我们必须及时扫清思想障碍，吸取别人的先进经验，才能前进再前进。
    第四，七号炉和第一炼钢厂别的炉子一样，由于很多老工人都支援新建钢铁企业了，增添了很多新工人（占50％）。因此，很快提高新工人的操作技术是打胜仗的重要保证。在1959年，我们的打算是以师带徒，一个老工人包培一个新工人，使新工人中的50％达到一助手水平，30％达到二助手水平，20％达到一般技术工水平。
    一年之计在于春，我们七号平炉的工人决心在1959年的开始就打个漂亮仗：保证年节期间出勤率百分之百，并在头两天就打破旧纪录创造出六点钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。
