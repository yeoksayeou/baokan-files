Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 25th: Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, who is currently visiting Venezuela, denounced the United States at a special session of the Venezuelan House of Representatives on the 24th, saying: The United States helped impose dictatorial rule on the people of Latin America. He suggested that all democratic countries in Latin America form a "democratic bloc" to "drive out the last dictator."

Castro was invited to participate in the first anniversary of the overthrow of former dictator Jimenez in Venezuela and arrived in Caracas by plane from Havana on the 23rd. He was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of people when he arrived at the airport.

According to reports, Castro delivered a two-hour inspiring speech at the special session of the House of Representatives on the Cuban revolution and its significance to the continent. In his speech, he called on all freedom-loving Latin American people to unite and support the struggle of the people of Dominica and Paraguay against dictatorial rule, and to jointly prevent foreign aggression. He said, "If the dictators have already united against us, we must unite to deal with them. Those concerned will know how and when to give them the final blow."

Castro also mentioned that Cuba will hold free elections in less than two years so that Cuba will have a legislative body that resolutely represents the true interests and rights of the Cuban people.

Castro's speech was warmly welcomed by the participants. During his speech, the deputies jumped up several times to applaud him with thunderous applause, which was enthusiastically echoed by the people who crowded the corridors and the thousands of people standing outside the Congress.

According to reports, on the evening of his arrival in Caracas, Castro reiterated the necessity of the Cuban government's suppression of Batista's murderous criminals at a mass rally. He emphasized that if the fruits of the revolution are to be maintained, then the execution of criminals is completely justified and absolutely necessary. He said, "The government is conducting these trials out of a clear demand for justice and with the unanimous support of the Cuban people." Castro, in condemning the slanderous propaganda of American politicians and American newspapers, said, "The purpose of this propaganda is to undermine the reputation of our revolution."

    卡斯特罗痛斥美国扶植独裁者
    号召拉丁美洲人民团结共御外侮
    指出古巴处决罪犯对保卫革命果实绝对必要
    新华社25日讯　加拉加斯消息：正在委内瑞拉进行访问的古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗24日在委内瑞拉众议院特别会议上谴责美国说：美国帮助了把独裁统治强加在拉丁美洲人民的头上。他建议所有拉丁美洲的民主国家成立一个“民主集团”来“赶走最后的独裁者”。
    卡斯特罗是应邀参加委内瑞拉推翻前独裁者希门尼斯一周年纪念，于23日由哈瓦那乘飞机来到加拉加斯的，在他到达飞机场时曾受到几万群众的热烈欢迎。
    消息说，卡斯特罗在众议院特别会议上就古巴革命及其对大陆的意义作了两小时的激动人心的演说。他在演说中号召所有爱好自由的拉丁美洲人民团结起来，支援多米尼加和巴拉圭人民反独裁统治的斗争，并共同防止外来的侵犯。他说，“如果各独裁者已经团结起来反对我们，我们必须团结起来对付他们。有关的人们将懂得如何和何时给他们以最终的打击”。
    卡斯特罗还谈到，古巴将在不到两年以内举行自由选举，使古巴有一个坚决代表古巴人民的真正利益和权利的立法机构。
    卡斯特罗的演说受到与会者的热烈欢迎。在他的讲话当中，议员们几次跳起来向他报以雷动般的掌声，这些掌声得到挤满走廊的人和站在国会外面千百个人热烈响应。
    据报道，卡斯特罗在到达加拉加斯的当天晚上曾经在一次群众集会上重申古巴政府镇压巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的必要性。他强调指出，如果要想保持住革命的胜利果实的话，那么，处决罪犯是完全正当的和绝对必要的。他说，“政府进行这些审讯是出于明确的正义要求，并且得到古巴人民的一致支持。”卡斯特罗在谴责美国政界人士和美国报刊的诽谤性宣传时说，“这种宣传的目的在于破坏我们的革命声誉”。
