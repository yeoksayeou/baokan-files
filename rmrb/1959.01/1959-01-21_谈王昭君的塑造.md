At the beginning of 1959, one of the noteworthy events in the capital's cultural life was the performance of the excellent Hunan operas "Zhaojun Out of the Border" and "Life and Death Tablet." Here, I will first discuss "Out of the Border." The Qiyang Opera "Out of the Border" is based on the old script, incorporating the strengths of "He Rong Ji" and "Qing Zhong Ji," simplifying the complex and refining the essence, highlighting the theme of the play. When you hear lines such as "Thousands of generals and soldiers in the court, yet a woman from the deep palace is sent"; "Rather be a ghost in the southern dynasty than an official in a foreign land"; and "Let alone people find it hard to walk, even horses hesitate to move past the gate"; "Geese fly south in formation, Zhaojun departs to the northern frontier with tears," you will feel a surge of patriotic emotion, which better expresses the Yuan dynasty playwright's grief and indignation when creating "Han Palace Autumn." Xie Meixian, the actress playing Zhaojun, immersed herself in the role, with tears flowing with her voice. Wang Long and the stable boy had close emotional exchanges with Zhaojun, which is also why this play is so moving.

In fact, the foreign relations during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, Liu Shi, were not as tense and humiliating as depicted in "Han Palace Autumn" or "Zhaojun Out of the Border." On the contrary, it was a time when the Han Dynasty was showing considerable strength. According to the Records of Emperor Yuan in the Former Han Dynasty, the Biography of the Xiongnu, and the Biography of the Southern Xiongnu in the Later Han Dynasty, the situation was as follows: In the third year of Emperor Yuan's Jianzhao era, he sent Gan Yanshou, the Commandant of the Western Regions, and Chen Tang, the Deputy Commandant, to send troops to attack Zhizhi Chanyu of the Northern Xiongnu, "beheading him and sending his head to the capital, hanging it at the gate of the barbarian residence." Emperor Yuan even reported this victory to the Imperial Ancestral Temple and changed the reign title to "Jingning" (meaning national tranquility). In the first year of Jingning (33 BC), Huhanxie Chanyu of the Southern Xiongnu came to court. Emperor Yuan, because he "did not forget his kindness, admired etiquette, and resumed the ceremony of paying tribute," and also expressed his "willingness to marry a Han woman to strengthen kinship," bestowed Wang Qiang (Zhaojun), who was then "awaiting orders in the side palace," to Chanyu as his Yan Zhi (read "yan you," meaning queen).

After Wang Zhaojun entered the Xiongnu, she was given the title of "Ninghu Yan Zhi" and had a son named Yitu Zhiyas with Huhanxie Chanyu. In the second year of Jianshi, Huhanxie Chanyu died, and the son of the Grand Yan Zhi, Diaotaomogao, became Fuzhulei Ruodi Chanyu. He wanted to marry Zhaojun as his wife according to Xiongnu custom. Zhaojun wrote to Emperor Cheng of Han requesting to return to her country. Emperor Cheng replied with an edict, telling her to "follow the customs of the Hu people." Thus, Zhaojun became the queen of the succeeding Chanyu, giving birth to two daughters. The elder daughter, Yunniang, was an Yimo Juzi (princess) and later married the nobleman Xubu Dang, becoming known as Xubu Juzi; the younger daughter was Dangyu Juzi.

At the beginning of Emperor Ping of Han's reign, the Empress Dowager held court, and Wang Mang was in power. To please the Empress Dowager, he hinted to the Chanyu to send Wang Zhaojun's daughter, Princess Xubu, to serve in the palace. Princess Xubu came to court, and the Empress Dowager was extremely pleased, bestowing many gifts upon her. In the fifth year of Wang Mang's Xin Dynasty, Wujuliu Ruodi Chanyu died. Xubu Dang, the Right Gutuhou, a minister in charge of affairs of the Xiongnu, was the son-in-law of Yunniang, Wang Zhaojun's daughter. Yunniang often wanted to establish peaceful relations with China. She was very close to Xian, the youngest son of the Grand Yan Zhi. After Wujuliu Chanyu died, they established Xian as Wulei Ruodi Chanyu. Yunniang and Xubu Dang suggested that Wulei Ruodi Chanyu establish peaceful relations with China. In the first year of Wang Mang's Tianfeng era, Yun Dang sent people to the Zhilu Fortress in Menghu County, Xihua, to inform the officials of the fortress, requesting to see Wang Xi, the Marquis of Peace, who was Wang Zhaojun's nephew and Yunniang's cousin. The Central Commandant reported this to Wang Mang, who sent Wang Xi and his brother Wang Sa, the Cavalry Commandant and Marquis of Zhande, to the Xiongnu, bestowing gold, clothing, painted silk, and congratulations to the newly established Chanyu. Later, he also enfeoffed Yunniang's husband, Gutuhou Xubu Dang, as the Duke of Houan, and her son, Nan She, as the Marquis of Houan. From the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, through the reigns of Emperors Yuan, Cheng, Ai, and Ping, the Chanyu "paid tribute for three generations and were guests in the Han court." For more than sixty years, until Wang Mang reopened hostilities, there was no war. It should be said that Wang Zhaojun and her daughter Yunniang played a certain role in this.

It is worth noting that Zhaojun's marriage was not forced but voluntary. The Biography of the Southern Xiongnu in the Later Han Dynasty states:

"Zhaojun's given name was Qiang, and she was a native of Nan Commandery. Initially, during the reign of Emperor Yuan, she was selected into the side palace as a daughter of a good family. At that time, Huhanxie came to court, and the emperor ordered that five palace women be given to him. Zhaojun had been in the palace for several years but had not been favored by the emperor. Accumulating sorrow and resentment, she asked the official of the side palace to seek permission to go. When Huhanxie was about to depart, there was a grand farewell ceremony. The emperor summoned the five women to show them off. Zhaojun was beautifully adorned, illuminating the Han palace with her splendor. Looking around, she stirred the emotions of those around her. The emperor was greatly surprised and wanted to keep her, but it was difficult to break his promise, so he gave her to the Xiongnu..."

This says that when Emperor Yuan wanted to select five palace women to bestow upon Huhanxie Chanyu, the leader of the Southern Xiongnu who had come to court, to consolidate the friendly relations between China and the Xiongnu, Wang Zhaojun voluntarily asked the official of the side palace to participate in this act of consolidating peace. Therefore, she did not drown herself to commit suicide, but rather went to the frontier with generosity and continued to carry out the will of her motherland and implement the mission of peace even after the old Chanyu died. From this perspective, "Zhaojun Out of the Border" can be written as a completely different play with national unity as its theme.

However, in an era when national oppression was very severe, the Yuan dynasty playwright Ma Zhiyuan had deep feelings about the Han people, especially the rulers and ministers of the Southern Song dynasty at that time, who did not strive for self-improvement, sought peace through humiliation, and ultimately led to the destruction of the country. They used the folk story of Mao Yanshou taking bribes through portraits, selling out the country, and causing border troubles, and through Wang Zhaojun, who was forced to leave the border and played the pipa on horseback, expressed the long-standing grief and indignation of the Han people, who had "arrows piercing the mouths of geese, with no one daring to cough." Therefore, it was changed so that Zhaojun had already been summoned and favored by Emperor Yuan before being selected to leave the border; after leaving the border, she refused to enter the foreign land and threw herself into the Black River. She neither married Huhanxie Chanyu, let alone married his son and had children with them. "The shadow of her jade pendant sways in the moon over the Green Tomb, the sound of her pipa fades in the autumn of the Black River." The poets shaped a completely different Wang Zhaojun who embodies national sentiment. This has even become the fixed image of Wang Zhaojun, and it is difficult for later generations to change it. Yuan people wrote about Han dynasty stories, not adhering to specific historical facts, but using the past to allude to the present, making the ancient serve the present. This is also a good example of valuing the present over the past in drama.

However, "Han Palace Autumn," from listening to the pipa under the moon to the farewell at Ba Bridge and the shocking dream in the Han Palace, mainly writes about this event from the perspective of Emperor Yuan of Han. Later, "Wang Zhaojun Out of the Border and Marrying for Peace" and "Qing Zhong Ji," as well as local operas "Zhaojun Out of the Border," put more effort into writing about Wang Zhaojun.

The Qiyang Opera Gaoqiang "Out of the Border" is largely a continuation and development of the twenty-ninth act of "He Rong Ji" and the "Sending Zhaojun" and "Out of the Border" scenes of "Qing Zhong Ji," with many lines borrowed from predecessors. However, the characters have different personalities. For example, Wang Long in "He Rong Ji" is Zhaojun's biological younger brother. Although he participated in the family's farewell, he did not escort her out of the border. In "Qing Zhong Ji," Wang Long has no blood relationship with Zhaojun; he was only sent by the emperor to escort Zhaojun, and he reluctantly took on this unpleasant task. Therefore, he says at the beginning: "I am none other than the unlucky Wang Long." Although playing this role requires many gestures, as the saying goes, "Sing Zhaojun to death, act Wang Long to death," he is actually a person with no heart.

Wang Long in the Qiyang Opera "Out of the Border," however, is the newly appointed Number One Scholar Liu Wenlong, who changed his name to Wang Long and was enfeoffed as the Imperial Uncle because Emperor Yuan ordered him to escort Zhaojun. Although he has no sibling relationship with Zhaojun, he is a person with some political feelings, sympathizing with Zhaojun's plight and caring about her fate along the way. In the end, when they parted, hearing Zhaojun say, "Bury my lonely soul at the source of the Black River," he was so moved that he shed tears and was reluctant to part. It should be said that this is a better Wang Long. The stable boy in the Qiyang Opera "Out of the Border" is not entirely a repetition of old movements; the movements are filled with emotion, making him a better stable boy as well. It would be just right not to exceed the scope that a stable boy should express.

Mr. Mei Lanfang commented on the Qiju Opera "Out of the Border," saying that the Zhaojun he used to play had more implicit singing, music, and movements, with emotions contained within, while this play of Qiju expressed them more strongly. This is true. But there are actually two approaches to Zhaojun in Peking Opera: one is more implicit in emotion, and the other is less emotional and more technical. Some Zhaojun give the impression mainly of countless beautiful riding movements. Beautiful as it is, the emotion of Zhaojun yearning for her homeland and resenting the emperor is nowhere to be found. It is only natural that we are amazed to discover a vivid and profound Zhaojun from the Qiju Opera "Out of the Border" today.

The Qiju Opera "Out of the Border" is indeed a better adaptation. In "Qing Zhong Ji," Zhaojun expresses many feelings of disgust when she sees the foreign soldiers. For example, she only says lines of physical criticism such as "His hair is like withered pine, his face is like black lacquer, his nose is like an eagle's beak, and his beard is like a mountain donkey." Not long ago, when listening to the Northern Kun Opera "Out of the Border," it was still sung this way, but the Qiju script has deleted all of these. This is completely right; we should no longer propagate such national prejudices. Also, for Wang Zhaojun's five things she cannot forget, according to "He Rong Ji," the first is that it is difficult to part with the kindness of her parents; the second is that it is difficult to part with the pillow she shares; the third is the good people who have been harmed; the fourth is the millions of iron-clad soldiers who work hard day and night; and the fifth is that the national grain and grass are all lost. "Qing Zhong Ji" only mentions the fourth to the fifth. The Qiju Opera changes the first to "It's hard to forget the good mountains and rivers of my homeland"; the second is the kindness of parents; the third is the good people of my homeland; the fourth is the Imperial brother's long journey of escorting me; the fifth is that it's hard to forget the three thousand iron-clad soldiers. This is much more appropriate. But some places can also be added or deleted. For example, Wang Long's opening poem, "The courtiers eat a thousand Zhong of millet for nothing, yet they send a beauty to marry for peace," originally comes from Zhaojun's parasol rain song in "Qing Zhong Ji," "Looking at those civil officials, they are all useless, and those military generals are also in vain, yet they ask me, a beauty, to marry for peace." Wang Long recites it first, and then Zhaojun sings, "Thousands of generals and soldiers in the court, yet they want me, a beautiful woman, to marry for peace," which is repetitive.

When Zhaojun plays the pipa on horseback, the string suddenly breaks. There are two very good lines in Ming You Hui'an's "Lamenting the Pipa" play: saying "A broken string can still be mended with phoenix glue, but I fear that a broken heart is hard to mend with phoenix glue." It would be good to add these two lines here.

In the first scene, the soldiers report "We have arrived at Yumen Pass." Wang Long asks Zhaojun to change horses. In the second scene, Zhaojun sings: "Yumen Pass, the north wind blows through my embroidered clothes and makes me cold." According to the fact that Zhaojun's Green Tomb is located twenty miles south of Guihua City (Gui Sui, today's Hohhot), traveling from Chang'an to today's Hohhot would certainly not go through Yumen Pass in Gansu. "He Rong Ji" has "Looking at the Great Wall from Yanmen Pass, even if there are twelve peaks of Wu Mountain, it is difficult to find." That is because Zhaojun's hometown is in Zigui, near the Wu Mountain range. But traveling from Chang'an to Hohhot does not need to detour through Yanmen Pass in Dai County, Shanxi. According to the geographical situation, it seems that one should take the Yulin Fortress.

Also, the Black River in "Han Palace Autumn" refers to the Heilongjiang River. Zhaojun asks: "What land is this?" The foreign envoy says: "This is the Heilongjiang River, the border between the foreign lands and the Han. The south belongs to the Han family, and the north belongs to our foreign country." Zhaojun borrows wine to bid farewell to the Han family, saying: "Han emperor, I am finished in this life, and I will wait for the next life." Then she jumps into the river and dies. Therefore, the Zhaojun of Qiju also sings: "Bury my lonely soul at the source of the Black River." But Gui Sui is far from the Heilongjiang River and very close to the Yellow River.

Finally, the escort official Wang Long should make some explanation to the foreign general who is welcoming Zhaojun, or go offstage for a moment, which would be more reasonable.

In short, the Qixi Opera's "Zhaojun Out of the Border" is a very distinctive and moving good play. We like this Wang Zhaojun, and we are deeply moved by her noble patriotism. But when the Guanshan and the Blackwater are no longer so desolate and terrifying; and when the people who drink camel's milk and eat sheep's ghee have become members of the great family of nationalities, can we shape another Wang Zhaojun who is also worthy of respect, under a new, more heroic spiritual style? Rather than being depressed in the deep palace, feeling jealousy for beauty, it is better to dedicate oneself to national unity far in the desert. This is actually a Wang Zhaojun who is more in line with the historical situation. There are already social conditions for writing such a Wang Zhaojun, but it takes a great risk to gain the approval of the audience. Are there any playwrights who dare to think and act like this?

    谈王昭君的塑造
    田汉
    1959年首，首都文化生活中引人注意的事件之一是优秀的湖南戏“昭君出塞”与“生死牌”的演出。这里先谈“出塞”。祁阳戏“出塞”是根据老本子，参合“和戎记”、“青冢记”的长处修改过的，删繁就简，去芜存菁，突出了本剧的主题思想。听到了“朝中将士千千万，却遣深宫一妇人”；“宁做南朝黄泉客，不做他邦掌印人”；以及“漫说是人难走，马到分关也步懒移”；“雁儿一字南归去，昭君含泪往北番”等词句，你会感到一种慷慨激越的爱国主义感情，也更能表达元代剧作家创作“汉宫秋”时的悲愤情绪。去昭君的演员谢美仙深入角色，泪随声下，王龙与马童和昭君有紧密的感情交流，也是这个戏如此感人的缘故。
    其实，汉元帝刘奭时代的对外关系并不像“汉宫秋”或“昭君出塞”里所描写的那样紧张、屈辱，相反地，那时还正是刘汉朝廷显示一定强大的时候。据前汉书元帝纪、匈奴传，后汉书南匈奴传等所载，情况是这样的：元帝建昭三年使护西域骑都尉甘延寿，副校尉陈汤等发兵攻北匈奴郅支单于，“斩其首，传诣京师，悬蛮夷邸门”。元帝为了这个胜利还告过太庙，并且改元“竟宁”（即国境安宁的意思）。竟宁元年（公历前三三年）春正月，南匈奴呼韩邪单于来朝，汉元帝因其“不忘恩德，向慕礼义，复修朝贺之礼”，又表示“愿婿汉氏以自亲”，便把当时“待诏掖廷”的王嫱（昭君）赐给单于做阏氏（读焉友，即王后）。
    王昭君入匈奴后，她被封为“宁胡阏氏”，和呼韩邪单于生了一个儿子叫伊屠·智牙斯。建始二年，呼韩邪单于死，大阏氏的儿子雕陶莫皋立为复株累若鞮单于，想按照匈奴风俗，以昭君为妻。昭君上书汉成帝请求回国，成帝复她的敕书，叫她“从胡俗”，于是昭君又做了后单于的王后，生了两个女儿，长女云娘为伊墨居次（公主），后嫁给贵族须卜当，称须卜居次；次女为当于居次。
    汉平帝即位之初，太后临朝，王莽当政，为了取悦太后，曾暗示单于要他派王昭君的女儿须卜公主入侍。须卜公主来朝，太后极为高兴，赏赐了她很多东西。新莽建国五年，乌居留若鞮单于死，匈奴用事大臣右骨都侯须卜当就是王昭君女儿云娘的女婿。云娘常常想和中国和亲，她跟大阏氏的少子咸很厚善，乌居留单于死后，他们就立咸为乌累若鞮单于。云娘和须卜当建议乌累若鞮单于跟中国和亲。新莽天凤元年云当派人到西河猛虎县制虏塞下，告塞上官吏，要求见和亲侯王歙，王歙是王昭君的侄儿，和云娘是姑表兄妹。中部都尉把这报告给王莽，莽派王歙和他的兄弟骑都尉展德侯王飒出使匈奴，赐黄金、衣被、绘帛、贺单于初立，后来还封云娘的丈夫骨都侯须卜当为后安公，封她的儿子男奢为后安侯。从汉宣帝朝起，经元、成、哀、平各朝单于“三世称藩，宾于汉廷”，直到王莽重开边衅为止，六十多年来没有战争。应该说王昭君和她的女儿云娘是起过一定作用的。
    值得注意的是昭君和亲并不是强迫的，而是出于她的自愿。后汉书南匈奴传云：
    “昭君字嫱，南郡人也。初元帝时，以良家子选入掖廷。时呼韩邪来朝，帝敕以宫女五人赐之。昭君入宫数岁，不得见御，积悲怨，乃请掖廷令求行。呼韩邪临辞大会，帝召五女以示之。昭君丰容靓饰，光明汉宫，顾影徘徊，竦动左右。帝见大惊，意欲留之，而难于失信，遂与匈奴。……”
    这是说当元帝要选五个宫女赐给来朝的南匈奴首领呼韩邪单于，来巩固中国和匈奴的友好关系的时候，王昭君自动向掖廷令（管宫廷的官）请求参加这个和亲壮举。因此她不是投水殉国，而是慷慨入番，就在老单于死后她还是继续执行祖国意旨，贯彻和亲任务。从这个意义出发，“昭君出塞”可以写成完全不同的、以民族团结为主题的剧本。
    但是元代剧作家马致远在民族压迫十分严重的时代，对汉民族，特别是当时南宋君臣不自振作，屈辱求和，终致国破家亡，有极深的感慨。他们便运用毛延寿画像索贿，卖国兴戎的民间故事，通过被迫出塞、琵琶马上的王昭君吐露汉民族长期以来“似箭穿着雁口，没个人敢咳嗽”的悲愤，因而改成昭君在被选出塞以前已经被元帝召幸了；出塞后不肯入番，而投身黑水了。她既不嫁给呼韩邪单于，更不用说再嫁给他的儿子，给他们生男育女了。“环珮影摇青冢月，琵琶声断黑江秋”，诗人们塑造出了寄托民族感情的完全另一个王昭君，这甚至已经成为王昭君的定型，后人很难更动它了。元人写汉代故事，不拘泥于具体史实，而借古喻今，古为今用，这也是戏剧上厚今薄古的一个好例。
    但“汉宫秋”从月下听琵琶，到灞桥送别，汉宫惊梦，主要从汉元帝角度来写这一事件。后来的“王昭君出塞和戎记”和“青冢记”以及地方戏的“昭君出塞”就用更多力量来写王昭君了。
    祁阳戏高腔“出塞”大体上是“和戎记”的第二十九折和“青冢记”的“送昭”、“出塞”的继承和发展，许多词句是袭用前人的。但人物性格却有不同之处。如王龙在“和戎记”里是昭君的亲弟弟，虽则参加过一家送行，却没有护送她出塞，在“青冢记”里，王龙与昭君并无骨肉关系，只是皇上派他护送昭君，他十分勉强地担任了这个不愉快的差使，因此他一上来便说：“自家非别，倒运的王龙便是”。虽说演这个角色的要求很多身段，所谓“唱死昭君，做死王龙”，但他实际是一个没有什么心肝的人。
    祁阳戏“出塞”中的王龙却是新科状元刘文龙因元帝命他护送昭君，才改名王龙，封为国舅的。他虽也和昭君无姐弟之亲，但却是一个有些政治感情的人，一路上同情昭君的遭遇，关心她的命运。最后分别，听到昭君说：“黑水源头葬孤魂”的时候，他是那样地感动流涕，惨然不舍。应该说这是一个较好的王龙。祁阳戏“出塞”的马童也不全重翻打，动作中带着感情，也是个较好的马童，只是不要超过一个马童所应该表示的范围就恰到好处了。
    梅兰芳先生评祁剧“出塞”说他自己过去演的昭君，唱腔、音乐、身段都比较含蓄、情感内蕴，而祁剧这出戏却表现得比较强烈。这是不错的。但京剧的昭君实际有两个路子：一是情感较含蓄，一是较少的感情，较多的技术。有些昭君给人的印象主要是无数美丽的趟马身段。美则美矣，而昭君那一腔依恋故国、怨愤君王的感情却不知到哪里去了。我们今天惊异地从祁剧“出塞”发现了一个生动深刻的昭君是很自然的。
    祁剧“出塞”的确是修改得较好。“青冢记”昭君见番兵的时候表示了许多厌恶情感。如只见他发似枯松，面如墨漆，鼻似鹰钩，须卷山驴”一类形体批评的词句，不久以前听北昆的“出塞”也还是这样唱的，祁剧本却都删去了。这是完全对的，我们不应当再宣传这样的民族偏见。又如王昭君的五难忘，按“和戎记”第一是难舍父娘恩；第二是“难割同衾枕”；第三是遭损害的良民；第四是昼夜辛勤的百万铁衣郎；第五是“国家粮草都输尽”。“青冢记”只把第四提到第五。祁剧把第一改成“难忘故国山河好”；第二是父母恩；第三是故土好黎民；第四是御弟千里遥遥护送情；第五是难忘三千铁甲兵。就恰当多了。但有些地方也可以做些增删。如王龙上场诗“朝臣枉食千锺粟，却教红粉去和番”，本是从“青冢记”昭君唱的梧桐雨“看那些文官济济全无用，就是那武将森森也枉然，却叫我红粉去和番”来的。王龙先念了，后来昭君再唱：“朝中将士千千万，反要我红粉佳人去和番”就重复了。
    昭君马上弹琵琶，忽然弦断，明尤悔庵的“吊琵琶”剧中有两句很好：说“弦断还堪续凤胶，只怕肠断了凤胶难续愁肠小。”这里正不妨加上这两句。
    第一场军士报“来此已是玉门关”王龙要昭君更马。第二场昭君唱：“玉门关，朔风吹透锦衣寒。”按昭君青冢既在归化城（归绥，今日的呼和浩特）南二十里，由长安到今日的呼和浩特决不走甘肃的玉门关。“和戎记”第二十九折点绛唇下有“雁门关上望长城，纵有巫山十二难寻觅”。那是因昭君的家乡在秭归，靠近巫山山脉吧。但长安出塞到呼和浩特也不必绕道山西代县过雁门关，按地理形势似应该走榆林塞。
    又黑水“汉宫秋”是指黑龙江，昭君问：“这里什么地面了？”番使云：“这是黑龙江，番汉交界处，南边属汉家，北边属我番国。”昭君借酒浇奠辞了汉家，说：“汉朝皇帝，妾今生已矣，尚待来生也。”因跳江而死。因此祁剧的昭君也唱：“黑水源头葬孤魂。”但归绥隔黑龙江甚远，而距黄河却甚近。
    最后护送官王龙应该跟迎接昭君的番将有所交代，或下场一下，才较合情理。
    总之，祁戏的“昭君出塞”是很有特色，很动人的好戏。我们欢喜这样的王昭君，我们为她的崇高的爱国至情而深受感动。但在分关、黑水已经不是那样荒寒可怕；饮骆浆、餐羊酥的人们已经成为民族大家庭的一员的时候，能不能在一种新的，更雄大的精神气派下，塑造出另一种也值得敬爱的王昭君呢？与其抑郁深宫，娥眉见嫉，还不如远适大漠献身于民族团结，这实际是真正的较符合历史情况的王昭君，要写出这样的王昭君已经有了社会条件了，但要取得观众的认可还得冒很大的险，有没有这样敢想敢做的剧作家呢？
