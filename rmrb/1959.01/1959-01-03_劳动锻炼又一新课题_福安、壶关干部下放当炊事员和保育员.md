　　Another New Subject in Labor Training
　　Fu'an and Huguan Cadres Sent Down to Serve as Cooks and Nannies

　　(Our Report) In order to truly improve the work of the people's commune canteens and nurseries, to ensure that commune members are well-fed, eat well, and raise children well and healthy, and to foster a social atmosphere where serving others is glorious, the CPC Fu'an Prefectural Committee and Fu'an County Committee in Fujian Province recently made specific regulations for cadres sent to lower levels. It was decided that cadres participating in physical labor should participate in the work of canteens and nurseries, serving as cooks and nannies.

　　The Fu'an Prefectural Committee stated in its regulations: Cadres of party and government organs, enterprises, and institutions at all levels, except for those who are old or ill and unable to participate in physical labor, must participate in at least one month of physical labor each year. Those who rarely participate in practical work or do not participate much in physical labor can participate in two to three months or more of labor. The main place to participate in labor is in rural people's communes, where they will be ordinary commune members, serving as cooks, nannies, educators, and feeders. Cadres in the industrial and transportation sectors should generally go to factories or roads to be workers, cooks, or road maintenance workers. Cadres in the commercial sector should go to stores as salespersons, cooks, or service personnel in the service industry. The Fu'an County Committee decided that all cadres who take turns going down to participate in physical labor for one month should all participate in canteen and nursery work, serving as cooks and nannies.

　　The regulations of the Fu'an Prefectural Committee and the Fu'an County Committee have been supported by the majority of cadres. Everyone is vying to sign up to go down to this glorious position. The first batch of cadres sent down includes Wei Luowang, Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Department of the Fu'an County Committee, Chen Ruzhen, Deputy Director of the County Women's Federation, Huang Xiangqing, Vice Chairman of the County Federation of Trade Unions, and Wu Changdi, Deputy Director of the Forestry Bureau. They have led one hundred cadres to the people's communes to engage in service labor. After they arrived at the people's communes, they were warmly welcomed by the commune members.

　　(Our Report) In order to ensure that all public canteens quickly get on the right track and ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and eat cleanly and hygienically, the CPC Huguan County Committee in Shanxi Province, in addition to making a series of arrangements, recently decided that all commune party committee secretaries, directors, and county bureau chiefs and above must personally go to the canteen and serve as cooks for a few days.

　　After this decision was issued, County Party Secretary Chen Chengfu took the lead and went to the Sixth Canteen of Pingshun Town to serve as a cook. He personally helped the cooks make noodles, stoke the fire, and clean up the dining hall. Through practical experience, he quickly found the problems existing in the canteen and helped them solve them. According to statistics, 410 commune party committee secretaries, directors, and above in the county have gone to the canteens to serve as cooks. Li Shunda, director of the Jinxing Commune, personally went to the Second Canteen of the commune a while ago and served as a cook for two days, helping the canteen increase the variety of food and improve the management system.

    劳动锻炼又一新课题
    福安、壶关干部下放当炊事员和保育员
    本报讯　为了切实改善人民公社的食堂、托儿所工作，保证社员吃饱、吃好，把孩子养好养胖，形成侍候人光荣的社会风气，中共福建省福安地委和福安县委，最近对下放干部作了具体规定，决定下放参加体力劳动的干部，要参加食堂和托儿所的工作，担任炊事员和保育员。
    福安地委在规定中说：各级党政机关、企业和事业单位的干部，除年老有病不能参加体力劳动者外，每人每年至少必须参加一个月的体力劳动。很少参加实际工作或参加体力劳动不多的人，可参加二个月到三个月或者更多的时间劳动。参加劳动的地方主要是农村人民公社，到公社中去做一个普通社员，担任炊事员、保育员、教养员、饲养员等职务。工业交通部门的干部，一般应到工厂或公路上，去做工人、炊事员或养路工。商业部门的干部，应到商店当营业员、炊事员，到服务行业做服务员。福安县委则决定所有轮流下放参加体力劳动一个月的干部，全部参加食堂和托儿所工作，担任炊事员和保育员。
    福安地委和福安县委这一规定，受到了广大干部的拥护。大家争先报名要求下放到这一光荣的岗位上去。第一批下放的有福安县委工业交通部部长魏洛旺、县妇联副主任陈如贞、县工会副主席黄祥庆、林业局副局长吴昌弟，他们已带领一百名干部下放到人民公社去从事服务性劳动。他们到达人民公社后，受到社员的热烈欢迎。
    本报讯　为了使所有的公共食堂迅速走向正轨，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃得干净卫生，中共山西壶关县委除作了一系列的布置外，最近又决定所有的公社党委书记、主任和县里的科局长以上干部，都要亲自到食堂当几天炊事员。
    这一决定发出后，县委书记陈成富即首先带头，到平顺镇第六食堂当了炊事员，他亲自下手帮助炊事员赶面、烧火和收拾饭厅。他从实际体验中，很快找到了这个食堂存在的问题，帮助他们解决了。据统计，这个县已有四百一十个公社党委书记、主任以上干部，下到食堂当了炊事员。金星社主任李顺达，在前些时候，曾亲到这个社的第二食堂当了两天炊事员，帮助这个食堂增加了饭菜的花样，改进了管理制度。
