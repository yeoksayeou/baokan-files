    From Lifting to Rocking
    Workers of Chongwen Vegetable Oil Factory, Sun Rongxuan, Zhang Kunjia

    We are workers at the Chongwen Vegetable Oil Factory, specializing in sesame oil.

    Although the factory has been operating for over thirty years and has some machinery, many tasks still rely entirely on physical labor. When loading finished sesame oil onto vehicles, it’s done by manual lifting. The large iron barrels weighing over four hundred pounds are truly heavy; even four young men struggle to lift them.

    In the past, every time we saw our colleagues sweating and straining to lift the barrels, we felt very sorry for them. We often discussed together, "When will we be able to use machines in our line of work?"

    Last November 8th, we visited the National Grain System Technical Revolution Exhibition. We saw a lever crane made by workers, constructed from several pieces of wood. It was simple in structure and convenient to use; pressing down on one side would lift things on the other.

    Back home, several of us discussed: Let’s also make such a crane. But how to do it? Nobody could explain the principles. This idea was brought to the attention of Comrade Han Jiec, our factory director and Party branch secretary. He called together seven or eight of us workers, encouraged us to do it, and told us to form a technical group, with three people taken off production to focus on tool improvement. A deputy factory director personally led this group. He himself attended our reporting meetings every evening.

    And so, we started working on it. We found three or four discarded railway ties and, imitating what we had seen, built a lever crane that looked pretty good from the outside. But when we hung an oil barrel on it, we couldn't press it down no matter what. After a long time, three or four people used a tremendous amount of effort to lift the thing. When it came time to load the vehicle, the oil barrel couldn't be lowered. Three or four people pulled on one end, while one person used a wooden stick to prop it up on the other. The wooden stick kept wobbling, causing the oil barrel to sway back and forth as if it were about to fall. It was truly nerve-wracking to watch. The loading workers found it clumsy and unsafe, and nobody wanted to use it.

    What to do? The two of us pondered together: When drawing water from the well, a crank mechanism on the pulley would bring one bucket up and the other down. If we could install such a mechanism on the lever crane, we wouldn't need people to pull the rope. We shared this idea with the technical group, and everyone thought it was feasible. They also suggested making the rope longer, as a longer rope would require less effort. Comrade Han Jiec also supported us.

    We wanted a wooden wheel and searched the entire factory for one. Eventually, we found an old car wheel in the scrap pile. After installing it and testing it, it worked well. But there was one problem: we couldn’t let go. We had to crank it down in one go; otherwise, the pulley would rewind, and the oil barrel would fall. We remembered that when treading the waterwheel in the countryside, when we got tired and wanted to rest, as long as we pushed back a little, the iron plate under the spur gear on the waterwheel would lock it in place. We thought we could install such a device on the pulley as well. We went to the workshop and searched for a long time, eventually finding a discarded pawl gear. This gear was large on one side and small on the other, making it difficult to use. We took it to the technical group to ask for ideas. A comrade named Bu Zhihe suggested that it could be used as long as the iron plate under the pawl gear was bent a little and a spring was installed under the iron plate.

    Without spending a single penny, we pieced together a lever crane in this way.

    Now, we only need one person to crank, and in one minute, we can easily lift a four-hundred-pound oil barrel. A strong person can lift it with just one hand.

    从抬到摇
    崇文植物油厂工人　孙荣轩　张昆甲
    我们是专做香油的崇文植物油厂的工人。
    工厂虽说已经开办三十多年，也有一些机器，但好多活还是全凭体力去干。做好香油装车时，也是用人抬。四百多斤的大铁桶，真沉，四个年青小伙子都抬不动。
    过去，每次看到我们的伙伴汗流浃背地抬桶，我们心里非常难过，大伙常在一起叨叨：“什么时候咱这一行才能使上机器？”
    去年11月8日，我们去全国粮食系统技术革命展览会参观。看见那儿摆着一台工人做的杠杆起重机，是用了几根木头搭成的。构造简单，用起来也挺方便，这边一压，那边东西就吊起来了。
    回到家，我们几个人在一起合计：咱们也来做这么一架起重机。可是怎么做呢？谁也说不出个道理来。这想法叫我们的厂长兼党总支书记韩介臣同志知道了，他把我们七、八个工人召在一起，鼓励我们干，并且叫我们成立一个技术小组，三个人脱产，专门改工具。这个小组由一个副厂长亲自领导。他自己呢？每天晚上来参加我们的汇报会。
    我们就这样干起来了。我们找了三、四根废枕木，照猫画虎搭了一个杠杆起重机，从外表看，挺像个样子。到挂上油桶，怎么压也压不动，弄了半天，三、四个人费了九牛二虎之力，才把东西吊起来。到装车的时候，油桶又吊不下来。三、四个人在这头拉，一个人在那头用木棍子顶，那木棍子老晃摇，弄的油桶摆来摆去，就像要掉下来，看着真叫人心跳。装车的工人看了都嫌笨嫌不保险，谁也不乐意使。
    怎么办？我们俩在一块琢磨：从井里打水时，一摇那鸳鸯罐的辘辘，这个桶上来了，那个桶下去了。要是在这杠杆起重机上也安那么个玩意儿，这样绳子就不用人拉了。我们把这想法在技术小组里说了说，大家都说行。他们还建议把绳子弄长一点，长了省劲。韩介臣同志也支持我们。
    我们想要一个木轮子。就满厂找。后来在废料堆里找着一个旧车轮子。安上去，一试，挺好用。可是有一样，不能松手，得一口气摇下去，不然，辘辘就会往回倒，油桶就会掉下来。我们想起在乡下踏水车时，有时踏累了，想歇一歇，只要往后一蹬，水车上的平牙轮下的铁板就把水车卡住不动了。心想，这辘辘上也可以安这么一个。我们到车间去找，找了很久，找到一个废狗头牙轮。这牙轮一边大，一边小，不好用。拿到技术小组请大家出点子，一个叫步致和的同志说，可以用，只要把狗头牙轮下的铁板打弯一点，铁板底下再安一个弹簧就能使。
    我们没花一个钱，就这样东拼西凑做成一个杠杆起重机。
  现在我们只要一个人摇，一分钟就能轻轻地把四百斤的油桶吊起。身强力壮的人，只要用一只手就能把它摇起。
