Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 21st: The National On-site Conference on Deaf Welfare Work was held in Tianjin from the 12th to the 20th. This conference was convened by the China Association for the Welfare of the Deaf-Mute. The conference focused on exchanging experiences in organizing deaf-mutes to participate in production, carry out education, prevent deafness, and develop deaf welfare organizations. The conference determined that, under the guidance of the principle of "starting from production, serving production, and promoting welfare through production," more, better, and more comprehensive deaf welfare work should be carried out this year.

According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two provinces and cities, in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, the number of deaf production units in various places increased ninefold, from twenty-three in 1957 to two hundred and twenty-three. The number of schools for the deaf and mute also increased from sixty-five in 1957 to one hundred and six. Many part-work, part-study private schools for the deaf and mute, spare-time schools, and literacy classes have also been opened in various places.

The meeting believes that, according to the specific conditions in various places, the two-pronged approach of decentralized employment and centralized organization of production should continue to be adopted to properly arrange for deaf-mutes to participate in labor production. If there are unreasonable phenomena in the division of labor and industries for deaf people already participating in production, appropriate adjustments should be made. According to the characteristics and labor capacity of the deaf, efforts should be made to make the best use of their talents; deaf production units that have already been established should be carefully inspected and rectified to improve business management; secondly, carrying out political and cultural education for the deaf and mute is an important political task.

During the meeting, Xie Juezai, Minister of the Interior, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that deaf welfare workers should go deep into the deaf masses, be students, understand the ideological situation of the deaf, appreciate the feelings of the deaf, learn the sign language of the deaf or learn to read lips, and help them properly solve production and life problems. Only in this way can we further promote the enthusiasm of the deaf masses in the cause of socialist construction.

    通过生产推进聋人福利
    全国聋人福利工作现场会议交流经验
    新华社天津21日电　全国聋人福利工作现场会议12日到20日在天津举行。这次会议是由中国聋哑人福利会召开的。会议着重交流了组织聋哑人参加生产、开展教育、防治聋症和发展聋人福利组织等经验。会议确定，在“从生产出发，为生产服务，通过生产，推进福利”的方针指导下，要更多更好更全面地开展今年聋人福利工作。
    据二十二个省市的不完全统计，在去年的工农业生产大跃进中，各地的聋人生产单位由1957年的二十三个发展到二百二十三个，增加了九倍。聋哑学校也由1957年的六十五所增加到一百零六所。各地还开办了不少半工半读的民办聋哑学校、业余学校和扫盲班。
    会议认为要根据各地的具体情况，继续采取分散就业和集中组织生产的两条腿走路的办法，妥善安排聋哑人参加劳动生产。对已参加生产的聋人，如果在分工分业上存在不合理的现象，应该予以适当调整。根据聋人特点和劳动能力，尽可能作到人尽其才，各尽所能；对已建立的聋人生产单位，要认真进行检查和整顿，改善经营管理；其次，向聋哑人开展政治和文化教育是一项重要的政治任务。
    会议期间，内务部部长谢觉哉到会讲了话。他强调指出，聋人福利工作者要深入到聋人群众中去，当学生、了解聋人的思想情况，体会聋人的感情，学会聋人的手势语或学会看口型，帮助他们妥善解决生产和生活上的问题。只有这样，才能更进一步发挥聋人群众在社会主义建设事业中的积极性。
