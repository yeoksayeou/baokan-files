    Combining Production, Everyone Participating, Widely Accumulating Manure, Greatly Manufacturing Fertilizer
    Hunan Launches Manure Sea Fertilizer Mountain Movement

    (Our Dispatch) Hunan, in its fertilizer accumulation efforts, fully leverages the superiority of the people's communes – many people, great strength – based on the characteristics of year-round greenery and abundant fertilizer sources. It adopts a combination of professional teams accumulating fertilizer and commune members' mass participation, combined accumulation of farm manure and creation of native chemical fertilizers. A year-round fertilizer accumulation, production, and preservation movement is underway. Since the winter fertilizer accumulation campaign launched in November of last year, as of January 15th, the province has accumulated more than 10 billion dan of farm manure, averaging about 200 dan of fertilizer per mu. As of January 15th, the province has built more than 30,000 native chemical fertilizer plants and more than 50,000 native blast furnaces, producing more than 20 million dan of various native chemical fertilizers, including more than 8.58 million dan of mixed potassium-calcium fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer. Last winter, the province sowed more than 15 million mu of green manure crops, which contain a lot of organic matter. Currently, most of these green manure fields are undergoing ditching and drainage, and some people's communes have also applied one or two top dressings of grass ash and pig and cattle manure for warmth and frost protection.

    Since last autumn, the fertilizer accumulation movement has been carried out amidst the overall great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and the tight labor situation. Thanks to the unified arrangements of the Party committees at all levels, most people's communes have established specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, and adopted phased and concentrated efforts according to different agricultural seasons. Therefore, the province has consistently maintained a fertilizer accumulation force of about one million people, showing that this year's fertilizer accumulation movement is characterized by: large scale, persistence, and concentration. The mountain-sitting fertilizer accumulation teams in the Xiangxi mountainous areas of Huaihua, Zhijiang, Mayang, and other counties combine fertilizer production with logging and other activities to burn a lot of fire soil ash, creating a magnificent scene of "smoke filling the clouds, fertilizer mountains piled up everywhere." Zhijiang County burned more than 200,000 dan of fire soil ash in the first five days of January. Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and other counties on the shores of Dongting Lake combine winter water conservancy construction with digging lake mud, establishing large ponds in the fields, and carrying out the "Manure Sea Fertilizer Mountain" movement. Due to the wide and scattered sources of fertilizer, while establishing professional fertilizer accumulation teams, all localities have also extensively mobilized commune members to participate in fertilizer accumulation in conjunction with various production activities. This not only alleviates the contradiction between fertilizer accumulation and labor shortage, but also kills two birds with one stone. Xiangxiang County adopted the method of combining "three-light" pest control with fertilizer accumulation. The county mobilized more than 150,000 people, cleared 630,000 field ridges and pulled 270,000 mu of rice stubble in four days, accumulating more than 18 million dan of fertilizer and eliminating pests at the same time, killing two birds with one stone. Hengshan County combined deep plowing with the widespread promotion of field ditch smoking soil method, simultaneously solving four problems: deep plowing, pest control, fertilizer accumulation, and soil improvement. Dao County adopted the method of "ten combinations," such as combining mountain repair and forest weeding with burning fire soil ash, combining water conservancy construction with digging pond mud, and combining cattle grazing with collecting wild manure. In more than ten days, it accumulated more than 200 million dan of fertilizer.

    In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor in fertilizer accumulation, many places have not only improved the fertilizer accumulation methods according to local conditions, but also actively implemented tool reforms for fertilizer accumulation and transportation. Xiangyin, Nanxian, Changde, Hanshou, and other counties on the shores of Dongting Lake changed from manual carrying to mud boat towing in the digging of lake mud. Some people's communes also used rope traction machines to tow mud boats, generally increasing efficiency by two to three times, and up to twelve times. Some people's communes in Mayang, Zhijiang, Ningyuan, and other counties in the mountainous areas of Xiangxi and Xiangnan used mountain slopes to set up cableways and chutes to transport fertilizer, which also greatly improved efficiency. The Yaoshi People's Commune in Mayang County set up 44 chutes on the mountain slopes, transporting 2,250 dan of fertilizer per person per day, which is 14 times more efficient than the original manual carrying.

    While accumulating fertilizer in the fields, all localities have also prominently focused on the collection of household manure. Changsha and other counties vigorously promoted the method of composting fertilizer in canteens, with each canteen of the Hexin People's Commune having a large pond with an area of one mu. Many places have also established construction site toilets and field manure sheds to prevent the loss of manure.

    While greatly accumulating farm manure, all localities have also launched a great movement to produce native chemical fertilizers. Among the more than 1,100 people's communes in the province, 879 communes have established native chemical fertilizer plants and started producing phosphate and potash fertilizers. A total of 330,000 people in the province participated in the manufacture of native chemical fertilizers, and they basically mastered the knowledge of identifying ores, mixing ingredients, and so on. The Hunan Provincial People's Committee recently organized some technical cadres to go to various special districts to help improve the crushing, mixing, calcining, and other technologies for manufacturing phosphate and potash fertilizers, and improve the quality of native chemical fertilizers.

    结合生产　人人动手　广积家肥　大造化肥
    湖南开展粪海肥山运动
    本报讯　湖南各地在积肥中，根据四季常青、遍地有肥源的特点，充分发挥人民公社人多力量大的优越性，采取专业队积肥与社员大家动手积肥相结合，积农家肥与造土化肥相结合的办法，正在开展四季积肥、造肥、保肥运动。从去年11月份起开展的冬季积肥运动，到1月15日止，全省共积农家肥料一百多亿担，平均每亩约有肥料二百担左右。到1月15日止，全省共建起土化肥厂三万多个，土高炉五万多个，已生产各种土化肥两千多万担，其中钾钙混合肥和磷肥有八百五十八万多担。含有机质多的绿肥，去冬全省播种一千五百多万亩。目前，这些绿肥田大都进行了开沟排水等培育工作，有些人民公社还追施一两次草木灰和猪牛粪，保温防冻。
    去秋以来，各地开展积肥运动一直是在工农业全面大跃进、劳动力紧张的情况下进行的。由于各级党委统一安排了劳动力，各人民公社大都建立了积肥专业队，加上按不同的农事季节，采取分段突击的办法，因此全省经常保持了约一百万人的积肥队伍，显示出今年积肥运动的特点是：规模大、持久、集中。湘西山区怀化、芷江、麻阳等县的坐山积肥队，结合伐木等活动大烧火土灰，出现了“烟雾弥漫白云间，处处堆起肥料山”的雄伟场面。芷江县1月的头五天就烧火土灰二十多万担。洞庭湖滨的湘阴、沅江等县结合冬修水利，挑湖泥，建立田头大氹，开展“粪海肥山”运动。由于肥源面广、分散，各地在建立专业积肥队的同时，又广泛地发动社员结合各项生产活动，人人动手积肥。这样做，不仅缓和了积肥与劳力不足的矛盾，而且是一举两得的好事情。湘乡县采取“三光”除虫结合积肥的办法，全县出动十五万多人，四天铲光田塍六十三万条、拔禾兜二十七万亩，共铲草积肥一千八百多万担，积肥又除虫，一箭双雕。衡山县结合深耕普遍推行了田间沟道熏土法，同时解决了深耕、除虫、积肥和改良土壤等四个问题。道县采取修山锄林结合烧火土灰、修水利结合挑塘泥、牧牛结合拾野粪等“十结合”的办法，十多天中积肥两亿多担。
    为了解决积肥中劳动力不足的困难，许多地方除了因地制宜地改进了积肥方法，而且积极实行了积肥、运肥的工具改革。洞庭湖滨的湘阴、南县、常德、汉寿等县在挑湖泥中改人挑为泥船拖，有些人民公社还利用绳索牵引机拖泥船，工效一般提高两、三倍，最高到十二倍。湘西、湘南山区的麻阳、芷江、宁远等县有些人民公社利用山坡架设索道和溜道运送肥料，也大大提高了工效。麻阳县尧市人民公社在山坡架设四十四处溜道，每人每天运肥二千二百五十担，较原来人挑的工效提高十四倍。
    在向田野积肥的同时，各地都比较突出地抓住了家肥收集工作。长沙等县大力开展了食堂沤氹肥的办法，合心人民公社的每一个食堂都有一亩面积的大氹。许多地方还建立了工地厕所、田间粪棚，防止粪便散失。
    在大积农家肥的同时，各地还开展了大造土化肥运动。全省一千一百多个人民公社中，已有八百七十九个公社建立了土化肥厂，开始生产磷钾肥。全省共有三十三万人参加制造土化肥，他们基本上掌握了鉴别矿石、配料等知识。湖南省人民委员会最近组织一部分技术干部分赴各专区，帮助改进制造磷钾肥的粉碎、拌合、煆烧等技术，提高土化肥质量。（胡坚）
