Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 24th: China's first largest gantry-type universal milling machine was recently successfully trial-produced at the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. After cutting tests, the performance was good and met the design requirements.

　　The worktable of the gantry milling machine is fixed and made of cement. It adopts the method of processing with the workpiece stationary and the tool moving. The width of the workpiece it processes is five meters. The machine tool can arbitrarily lengthen the guide rail, and the length of the workpiece being processed is not limited. Its weight is only more than 70 tons, which is about one-tenth of the weight of similar models of machine tools in the world. At the same time, it can also change the headstock to perform multiple processing operations such as grinding, drilling, and boring.

　　This milling machine was designed by the workers of the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. During the design process, it received strong assistance from manufacturing departments, research institutions, and users outside the factory. During the trial production process, it also received strong support from units such as Heilongjiang General Machinery Factory.

    齐齐哈尔制成最大铣床
    新华社哈尔滨24日电  我国第一台最大的天桥式万能铣床，最近在齐齐哈尔第一机床厂试制成功。经过切削试验，性能良好，达到设计要求。
    天桥式铣床的工作台是固定式的，用水泥浇成，采取工作物不动、刀具动的方式加工。它所加工的工作物，宽度为五公尺。机床可以任意接长导轨，加工的工作物长度不受限制。它的重量只有七十多吨，约为世界上类似型号机床重量的十分之一。同时它还可以改换床头，进行磨、钻、镗等多种加工。
    这台铣床是由齐齐哈尔第一机床厂职工自行设计的；在设计过程中得到厂外制造部门、研究机关和用户的大力帮助，在试制过程中还得到黑龙江通用机器厂等单位的有力支援。
