    "Explanation of *Shi Shuo*"
    Fan Xing
    An old gentleman over fifty years old has probably read Han Yu's "*Shi Shuo*." There are several sentences in this article that are worth thinking about for today's teachers and students. For example, he said:
          "Confucius said: 'If three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher.'
    Therefore, the disciple is not necessarily inferior to the teacher, and the teacher is not necessarily better than the disciple. There is a sequence to hearing the Dao, and specialization in skills and learning; that is all."
    Han Yu's original intention was to write this article as a self-explanation because he had accepted disciples and wanted to counter the criticisms of public opinion at the time. His point was that although he had become a teacher, he was not necessarily better than his disciples in every way, and those who learned from him were not necessarily inferior to him. People should not be surprised by this. Originally, as long as a person heard the Dao first, no matter who they were, they could be worshipped as a teacher. What needs to be learned is knowledge, and there is no need to ask whether they were "born before me" or "born after me"; nor is it necessary to demand that the teacher be proficient in all kinds of martial arts. As long as they are better than oneself in one area, one should recognize them as a teacher and learn from them. This is said to those who seek knowledge. But it can also be said conversely to teachers who "transmit the Dao, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts."
      "The disciple is not necessarily inferior to the teacher, and the teacher is not necessarily better than the disciple" is a truth, not nonsense. There is no absolutely insurmountable boundary between teachers and students. The teacher is superior to the student in this knowledge, and the student may be superior to the teacher in another knowledge; the teacher is superior to the student today, and the student may surpass the teacher tomorrow. This is also dialectics, the unity of opposites. Teachers and students can transform into each other: students must learn from teachers, and teachers also have things they need to learn from students.
    There is a famous passage in the *Record of Rituals's* "Learning Record," which has a similar meaning: "Although there is delicious food, one will not know its taste if one does not eat it. Although there is the ultimate Dao, one will not know its goodness if one does not learn it. Therefore, one knows one's inadequacy after learning, and one knows one's difficulties after teaching. Knowing one's inadequacy, one can then reflect on oneself. Knowing one's difficulties, one can then strengthen oneself. Therefore, it is said: 'Teaching and learning promote each other.' The 'Shuo Ming' says: 'Teaching and learning each account for half.' Is this what it means!" The words of the *Record of Rites* emphasize self-reflection and self-strengthening, but are not as thorough as Han Yu's. However, what it says, "one knows one's difficulties after teaching" and "teaching and learning promote each other," and the quoted "teaching and learning each account for half" (that is, teaching and learning each account for half, opposite and complementary), is still an irrefutable truth even today.
    A teacher inevitably also acts as a student, or first acts as a student, just as Marx said, "Educators must first be educated." This principle is very simple, but people find it very difficult to admit in actual life. Especially those who have been teachers for a long time, or those who, as Han Yu said, "specialize in skills and learning," find it very difficult to accept this point of dialectics.
    There are reasons why teachers do not easily accept this principle. Although "the disciple is not necessarily inferior to the teacher, and the teacher is not necessarily better than the disciple" is a viewpoint put forward by Han Yu, a representative of feudal thought, it was not popular in the feudal era. On the contrary, "heaven, earth, sovereign, parents, and teacher"—in the feudal era, the teacher was with "heaven, earth, sovereign, and parents," high above and condescending, so how could disciples be equal to teachers and yet in a unity of opposites? The teacher is, after all, the teacher; the teacher's way is respected and inviolable. The disciple is, after all, the disciple; how can they surpass the teacher? This view has been followed for a long time, and until recently, many people did not expect that there would be a great change in the ethical relationship between teachers and disciples that had existed for thousands of years.
    The new teacher-student relationship is really like what Han Yu said, "not ashamed to learn from each other." That is, to be each other's teachers and each other's students, to be equal to each other, without distinction between superior and inferior, truly "where the Dao exists, the teacher exists," whoever has knowledge is the teacher.
    Of course, academic and ideological criticism and teaching reform should have principles and goals. The principle is "let a hundred schools of thought contend, let a hundred flowers bloom," and the goal is to improve academics and improve teaching, not to criticize for the sake of criticism or to reform for the sake of reform. From the student's point of view, there should be a spirit of respecting the truth, "where the Dao exists, the teacher exists"; from the teacher's point of view, there should also be a generosity like Confucius, with a bit of "if three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher."
    Han Yu cited Confucius's precedent and made the judgment that "sages have no constant teacher." This sentence means that truly intelligent and knowledgeable people do not have fixed teachers; when they see someone with knowledge, no matter who they are, they recognize them as their teacher. I think I must add a sentence to him: "The teacher also has no constant way," that is, being a teacher does not always equate to truth. A teacher must dare to adhere to his own truth, and also dare to admit his own non-truth. As long as he can do this, he is a "constant teacher" and a "true teacher." Those who want to maintain their position as teachers may want to try this approach and strive for scientific truth together with their students.
    On the other hand, students should also understand: Since the relationship between teacher and disciple is not conditional on the teacher being necessarily better than the disciple or the disciple being necessarily inferior to the teacher, then today's students, after seeing a shortcoming of the teacher in a certain aspect, should not immediately conclude that the teacher can no longer be a teacher. A shortcoming in one aspect does not equate to shortcomings in all aspects; conversely, a strength in one aspect does not equate to strengths in all aspects. Even if students and teachers exchange positions, one should still "not be ashamed to learn" from those who have more knowledge than oneself. Moreover, positions cannot be exchanged; moreover, today's students bear a great mission and should more deeply recognize that their knowledge is still very limited and they must humbly learn from all who know something and have strengths, especially from teachers who "specialize in skills and learning"!
    This is my "Explanation of *Shi Shuo*."

### “师说”解

专栏：

    “师说”解
    繁星
    年过五十的老先生，大概总读过韩愈的
  “师说”。这篇文章里很有几句话值得今天当老师和学生的想一想。例如他说：
          “孔子曰：三人行，则必有我师。
    是故弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟
    子。闻道有先后，术业有专攻，如是而
      已。”
    韩愈的原意，是因为自己接受了门徒，为了抵制当时舆论的非议，所以写这篇文章自解。他的意思是说，自己虽是作了先生，并不一定样样贤于弟子，从他学的人也不一定不如他，人们不必因此而大惊小怪。本来，只要是一个人闻道在先，不管他是什么人，都可以拜为老师。要学习的是知识，用不着问他“生乎吾前”或“生乎吾后”；也用不着要求老师精通百般武艺，只要他有一门是比自己好的，就应该认他为师，向他学习。这是讲给求学的人听的。但也可以反过来讲给“传道受业解惑”的老师们听。
      “弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子”，这是一个真理，并不是瞎说。老师和学生并没有什么绝对不可逾越的界限。在这门知识上老师高于学生，在另一门知识上，学生也可能高于老师；今天老师高于学生，明天学生可能高过老师。这也是辩证法，对立面的统一。老师和学生可以互相转换：学生要向老师学习，老师也有需要向学生学习之处。
    礼记的“学记”有一段著名的话，意思也和这相近：“虽有嘉肴，弗食，不知其旨也。虽有至道，弗学，不知其善也。是故学然后知不足，教然后知困。知不足，然后能自反也。知困，然后能自强也。故曰：教学相长也。‘说命’曰：‘斅学半’。其此之谓乎！”礼记的话着重在自反自强，不如韩愈说得更彻底。但是它所说的“教然后知困”，“教学相长”，所引的
  “斅学半”（就是说教学各居其半，相反而相成），就是在今天看来，也还是颠扑不破的。
    做先生的必然同时做学生，或者首先做学生，像马克思所说的“教育者必先受教育”，这个道理说来很浅显，但是人们在实际生活中却很不容易承认。特别是当老师当久了的人，或者像韩愈所说的“术业有专攻”的人，就很不容易接受这点辩证法。
    老师们不容易接受这个道理，倒也事出有因。“弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子”，虽是封建思想的代表者韩愈所提出来的一个观点，但是在封建时代却并不通行。正好相反，“天地君亲师”，在封建时代，老师是同“天地君亲”在一起，居高而临下，弟子哪里能同老师上下平等而又矛盾统一呢？老师毕竟是老师，师道尊严，神圣不可侵犯，弟子毕竟是弟子，怎可以超过老师？这个观点相沿成习，直到不久以前，还有许多人没有料到千古以来的老师和弟子，会有一个伦常大变的时候。
    新的师生关系，倒真像韩愈所说的，是“不耻相师”。就是互为老师，互为学生，彼此平等，不分尊卑，真正是“道之所存，师之所存”，谁有学问，谁就是老师。
    当然，学术思想批判和教学改革，是应当有方针、有目标的，方针是“百家争鸣，百花齐放”，目标是提高学术和提高教学，不是为批判而批判，为改革而改革。从学生方面来说，应该有“道之所存，师之所存”的尊重真理的精神；从老师方面来说，也应该像孔夫子那样，有一点“三人行，则必有我师”的雅量。
    韩愈援引孔子的先例，作出判断说，“圣人无常师”。这句话的意思，是说真正聪明有学问的人，没有一定的老师；见人有学问，不管是谁，就认他为师。我想还得给他添一句：“师亦无常道”，就是当老师的并不经常等于真理。一个当老师的人，既要勇于坚持自己的真理，也要勇于承认自己的非真理。只要能作到这样一点，他就是“常师”和“真师”了。要保持师位的，不妨试一试这条方案，同学生们一道来为科学真理奋斗。
    在另一方面，当学生的也应当了解：既然师和弟子的关系并不以师必贤于弟子、弟子必不如师为条件，那末，今天的学生在看到老师的某一方面的短处以后，也就不应该马上得到结论说，老师再不能作老师了。某一方面的短处并不等于一切方面的短处；反之，某一方面的长处也并不等于一切方面的长处。即令把学生和老师换个位置，对于比自己多一些知识的人也仍然应该“不耻相师”。何况位置还并不能互换；何况今天的学生担负着重大的使命，更应该深切地认识自己知道的还很有限，还必须虚心地向一切有所知、有所长的人学习，特别是向“术业有专攻”的老师们学习呢！
    这就是我的“师说”解。
