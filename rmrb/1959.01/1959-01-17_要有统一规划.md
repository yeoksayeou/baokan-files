    There Must Be Unified Planning
    People's communes want to vigorously develop industry, and many people's communes have established many large and small factories in a few months. The newsletter published in this newspaper today, "A Victorious First Step," introduces how the Gucheng Commune in Suqian County, in less than fifty days, established more than 120 commune-run and team-run factories in one go. These factories manufacture tools and supply fertilizers for agricultural production, process agricultural products, and also produce a lot of non-staple foods to supply members and the market. Through vivid facts, the author allows us to once again see how much benefit running industry brings to the commune, and also allows us to more deeply understand the correctness of the commune's implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture. Currently, how much labor should be drawn from the agricultural front to run industry? When implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, it is necessary to carefully consider this issue. The development of commune-run industries can certainly directly serve agricultural production, promote the development of agricultural production, and increase the economic value of agricultural products; it can accelerate the process of national industrialization and narrow the gap between urban and rural areas. However, the development of commune-run industries can only be gradually, planned, and in batches, according to the different conditions of each commune; as for how much labor is transferred to the industrial front, it is necessary to pay attention to the current needs of agricultural production. If there is a lack of unified planning, whether too much or too little labor is drawn will be detrimental to both industrial and agricultural production.

    要有统一规划
    人民公社要大办工业，许多人民公社在几个月中已经办起了许许多多的大小工厂。今天本报发表的通讯——“胜利的第一步”，介绍了宿迁县古城公社在不到五十天中，一鼓作气，兴办了一百二十多个社办的、队办的工厂。这些工厂为农业生产制造工具，供应肥料，为农产品进行加工，也为供应社员和市场需要生产了不少副食品。作者通过生动的事实，让我们再一次看到了办工业给公社带来了多大好处，也让我们更深刻地认识到公社实行工农业并举方针的正确性。在目前究竟应该从农业战线抽多少劳动力去办工业？在执行工农业并举方针的时候，对这个问题有必要进行周密考虑。社办工业的发展，固然可以直接为农业生产服务，促进农业生产的发展，提高农产品的经济价值；可以加快国家工业化的进程，缩小城乡差别。但是，社办工业的发展，只能根据各个公社不同条件，逐步地有计划地分期分批兴办；至于转移到工业战线的劳动力的多少，必须注意考虑到当前农业生产的需要。如果缺少统一规划，劳动力抽得多了或少了，对工农业生产都是不利的。
