    Strive to Correctly Reflect Objective Reality

    The dialectic of the movement of things is a universal law. Our task is not to generally understand the meaning of dialectics, but to find the dialectic of the movement of things under various specific conditions in the ever-changing and varied things—the laws of the development of things. We must seriously study: "The contradictions of each form of material movement, the contradictions of each form of movement in each development process, each aspect of the contradictions of each development process, the contradictions of each development stage in each development process, and each aspect of the contradictions of each development stage." ("On Contradiction") to grasp the essence of things. But this is very complicated and requires serious investigation and research, avoiding subjective arbitrariness. The principles of "overall planning and comprehensive arrangement, classification and queuing, comparative analysis" instructed by the Party Central Committee are both leadership principles and methods of understanding things. For everything, we must look at two points, two sides, and even more, see the interconnections of the thousands of things that exist simultaneously, distinguish the principal contradiction from the secondary contradiction, and see the development and changes of the contradiction. Therefore, classification and queuing, and comparative analysis, are often the basis for overall planning and comprehensive arrangement.

    Boosting morale and leaving room for maneuver must be unified. The revolution's room for maneuver is to see the existing shortcomings while seeing the achievements, to see the truth and not forget the false, to see the victory and not forget that new contradictions have arrived. The so-called room for maneuver is to be vigilant at all times. On the one hand, we must strive to make our understanding correctly reflect objective reality, and on the other hand, we must also estimate that our understanding is still inevitably somewhat one-sided, because things themselves are extremely complex.

    We strive to make our understanding correctly reflect objective reality, which is the direction of our efforts; it is inevitable that errors will occur in our understanding, because the complexity of things determines that it is impossible for our subjectivity to always reflect the objective world 100% correctly. In each specific struggle, grasping the law of contradictory movement concretely is by no means easy, which requires scientific analysis. Lofty ideals must be combined with down-to-earth actions. The style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do is based on the general law of the development of things, while seeking truth from facts is to use the general law to seek the specific law of things under special conditions.

  Consciously Apply Objective Laws

    Some people think that transforming nature, diverting water to the mountains, and transforming the small-scale peasant economy into a collective economy is changing the law. This is completely wrong. Michurin's successful research on plant grafting is not for any other reason, but because he found the performance of plant production, which can graft one plant onto another, but he can't graft plants and stones together. From the point of view of diverting water to the mountains, when people understand the laws of nature, they can build dikes and dams to raise the water level, or use pumps to divert water to high places through the pressure of air to irrigate the land, but this does not change the law of water flow. As for the small-scale peasant economy being changed to a collective economy, generally speaking, this is using the law that the relations of production must adapt to the nature of the productive forces. If this is not done, and it is allowed to remain on the basis of individual decentralization, it will inevitably cause class differentiation, making farmers still unable to get rid of poverty. All this shows that it is not people who have changed the law, but precisely the result of people using the law.

    Some people confuse policies and laws with objective laws, which is also completely wrong. Policies and laws are not inherent in things themselves, but are formulated by people based on objective laws, and only have legal effect. Whether it is correct or not can only be proved by practical testing. Correct policies and laws can promote the continuous development of things; wrong policies and laws will affect the progress of things, causing work failures and confusion, but ultimately it cannot change the direction of development of things. Our policies and laws reflect objective laws, so we have achieved the great leap forward.

  Both Liberate the Mind and Seek Truth from Facts

    Chairman Mao said: "The changing movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of truth in practice never ends." That is to say, the development of objective things is infinite, and the process of people's understanding that reflects the development of objective things is also infinite. People's understanding of a thing is always from the shallow to the deep, from the low level to the high level, from the simple to the complex, from the incomplete to the complete; at the same time, old things are recognized, and new things appear, requiring people to recognize them again. Also, because people's understanding often lags behind reality, if we do not constantly break superstitions and liberate our minds, we cannot move forward victoriously. The process of people's understanding is a process of constant practice, constantly breaking superstitions, and liberating the mind, and it is also a process of constantly seeking the objective law of things. It can be seen from this that the development of things is infinite, and human wisdom is endless. Thought liberation is also bottomless. Of course, in a certain time and under certain conditions, people's understanding is also limited. But the limited is relative, and the infinite is absolute. Due to the development of science, people's understanding is always moving forward by constantly overcoming contradictions. And seeking truth from facts is also to constantly seek the law of objective things. Therefore, the two are completely consistent, and both require us to dare to explore objective truth, grasp the laws of the development of things, make the subjective consistent with the objective, and turn the objectively existing possibility into reality. If seeking truth from facts is misinterpreted as not daring to think and act, it will lack drive, be lukewarm, hinder the development of the cause, and commit right-leaning conservative errors. Conversely, if daring to think and act is misinterpreted as not seeking truth from facts, it will be impetuous and blind, only hot and not cold, turning good things into bad things, and committing "left" leaning adventurous errors. Therefore, both of these views are one-sided.

    愈是认识客观规律性　愈能发挥主观能动性
    报刊文摘
    力求正确反映客观实际
    事物运动的辩证法，是一条普遍的规律。我们的任务，不在于一般地理解辩证法的意义，而在于在千变万化，千差万别的事物中，找出各种具体条件下事物运动的辩证法——事物发展的规律，我们必须认真研究：“各个物质运动形式的矛盾，各个运动形式在各个发展过程中的矛盾，各个发展过程的矛盾的各方面，各个发展过程在其各个发展阶段上的矛盾以及各个发展阶段上的矛盾的各方面。”（“矛盾论”）才能把握事物的本质。但这是十分复杂的，必须认真调查研究，切忌主观随意。党中央指示的“统筹兼顾、全面安排、分类排队、比较分析”的原则，这既是领导原则，又是认识事物的方法。对每件事情要看两点、两面，更要看到同时存在的千万种事物的相互联系，分清主要矛盾和次要矛盾，看到矛盾的发展和变化。所以，分类排队、比较分析，常常是统筹兼顾、全面安排的依据。
    鼓足干劲与留有余地必须统一。革命的留有余地，是要在看到成绩的同时，也要看到存在的缺点，看到真而不要忘记假，看到既得的胜利而不要忘记新的矛盾已经到来。所谓留有余地，就是时时警惕着自己，一方面要力求使自己的认识正确反映客观实际，另一方面也要估计到自己的认识还难免有某些片面的地方，因为事物本身是极其复杂的。
    我们力求使自己的认识正确地反映客观实际，这是我们努力的方向；我们认识上会出现错误，这是不可避免的。因为事物的复杂性决定着我们主观不可能经常百分之百的正确地反映客观世界。在每个具体斗争中，具体地把握住矛盾运动的规律，决非轻而易举的事，这就需要科学分析。远大的理想必须与踏实的行动相结合。敢想敢说敢做的风格是以事物发展的一般规律为根据的，实事求是则是运用一般规律寻求事物在特殊条件下的具体规律。

  自觉地运用客观规律
    有的人认为改造大自然，引水上山，改造小农经济为集体经济，就是改变了规律，这是完全不对的。米丘林研究成功植物嫁接，不是别的原因，而是由于他找到了植物生产的性能，可以把一种植物嫁接到另一种植物上，但他总不能把植物和石头嫁接在一起。从引水上山来说，当人们认识了自然规律后，就可以修堤、筑坝，提高水位，或使用抽水机，通过空气的压力作用把水引到高处灌溉土地，但这并没有改变水流的规律。至于小农经济改变为集体经济，从总的方面来说，这是利用了生产关系要适合生产力性质的规律，如果不这样作，让它还停留在个体分散的基础上，就一定引起阶级分化，使农民仍然不能摆脱贫困。这些都说明，不是人们改变了规律，恰恰是人们利用规律的结果。
    有的人把政策法令和客观规律混为一谈，这也是完全错误的。政策法令不是事物本身固有的东西，而是人们依据客观规律制定的，只有法律上的效力。它的正确与否，只有通过实践的检验才能证明。正确的政策法令，能够促进事物不断向前发展；错误的政策法令，则会影响事物的前进，造成工作的失败和引起混乱，但它最终也改变不了事物发展的方向。我们的政策法令反映了客观规律，所以才取得了大跃进的成绩。

  既解放思想又实事求是
    毛主席说：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”这就是说，客观事物的发展是无限的，反映客观事物发展的人们的认识的过程也是无限的。人们对于一件事物的认识，总是由浅入深，由低级到高级，由简单到复杂，由不完整到完整；同时，旧事物被认识了，新事物又出现了，又要求人们去认识它。又由于人们的认识常常落后于实际，如果不是不断地破除迷信，解放思想，我们就不能胜利前进。人们认识的过程，是不断地实践，不断地破除迷信，解放思想的过程，也是不断地寻求事物的客观规律的过程。由此可见，事物的发展是无限的，人类的智慧是无穷无尽的。思想解放也是无底的。当然，在一定的时间、条件下，人的认识又是有限的。但有限是相对的，无限是绝对的。由于科学的发展，人们的认识总是不断地克服矛盾而前进。而实事求是也就是为了不断地寻求客观事物的规律性。因此，两者完全是一致的，都是要求我们勇于发掘客观真理，掌握事物的发展规律，使主观和客观一致起来，把客观存在的可能性变为现实。如果把实事求是曲解为不能敢想敢做，就会缺乏干劲，只冷不热，阻碍事业的发展，犯右倾保守的错误。反之，如果把敢想敢做曲解为不要实事求是，就会急躁盲目，只热不冷，把好事办成坏事，犯“左”倾冒险的错误。因此，这两种观点都是片面的。
