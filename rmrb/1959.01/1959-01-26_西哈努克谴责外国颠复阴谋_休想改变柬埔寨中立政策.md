Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 25th: The "Cambodian Current Situation" weekly published a record of an interview with Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk on the 24th. Sihanouk accused some foreign countries and their Cambodian agents of attempting to "ruin Cambodia's neutrality and me along with it." Sihanouk said, "I cannot say who revealed this conspiracy to me, but I can talk about who didn't."

He said, "Despite the fact that our American friends possess a very active and capable intelligence agency, and also provide many convenient conditions in our eastern and western neighboring countries, they did not think it necessary to let us know about this matter, which makes many of my compatriots doubt whether the Americans are being fair in dealing with this matter, which they can hardly be unaware of."

Sihanouk pointed out that among those who held secret meetings at night in Phnom Penh were former minister Sang Saly, a partner of Son Ngoc Thanh, and an employee of the embassy of a certain Western power. When talking about why the enemy was playing tricks, Sihanouk said: "They are very clear that no matter how hard they try to promote it, the people of our country still support me." "Cambodia's neutrality cannot be attacked, and no major country criticizes its neutrality anymore, at least not officially."

Sihanouk said that neighboring countries that sided with (the United States) would receive less respect from the American people, "They only get a little more money, which is of little value compared to national pride."

Sihanouk said: Our neighbors and some extremist Americans dream of dragging Cambodia into the "anti-communist front." He said that this is impossible because it violates the will of the Cambodian nation. Sihanouk said: "Any attempt to change our national system and policy direction will end in disaster." He said, "In other countries, I hope our American friends, like other smarter Western countries, can understand our neutrality and see it as the lesser of two evils."

    西哈努克谴责外国颠复阴谋
    休想改变柬埔寨中立政策
    新华社金边25日电　“柬埔寨现状”周刊24日发表了一篇柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王访问记。西哈努克指责一些外国和它们的柬埔寨特务说，他们企图“把柬埔寨的中立连我一起搞垮”。西哈努克说：“我不能说出谁向我揭发这个阴谋，但是，我可以谈谈谁没有这样做。”
    他说：“尽管我们的美国朋友拥有十分活跃而且手段厉害的谍报机关，而且在我们的东面和西面的邻国那里还提供许多便利条件，但是，他们没有认为应该让我们知道这件事情，这就使得我的许多同胞对美国人对待这件他们很难会不知道的事件是否公正表示怀疑。”
    西哈努克指出，那些在金边在夜里举行秘密会议的人中，有前大臣、山玉成的伙伴桑·萨里，和某西方大国大使馆的雇员。西哈努克在谈到敌人为甚么玩弄阴谋时说：“他们十分清楚，不管他们怎样拼命宣传，我国的人民还是支持我”。“对柬埔寨的中立是无法加以攻击的，任何大国都不再批评它的中立，至少是不再正式批评”。
    西哈努克说，投顺（美国）的邻国将受到美国人民更少的尊重，“它们只不过多得一点钱罢了，这一点用民族自豪感来比，是所值甚微的。”
    西哈努克说：我们的邻人和某些偏激的美国人梦想把柬埔寨拖进“反共阵线”。他说，这是不可能的，因为它违背柬埔寨民族的意志。西哈努克说：“一切改变我们的国家制度和政策方针的尝试，都会以灾难告终”。他说：“在其它国家中，我希望我们的美国朋友能够像其他聪明些的西方国家那样，理解我们的中立，并且把它看成是较小的祸患。”
