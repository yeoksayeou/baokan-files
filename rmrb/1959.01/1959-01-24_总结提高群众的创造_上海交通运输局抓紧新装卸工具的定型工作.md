Summarize and Improve Mass Creativity
Shanghai Transportation Bureau Seizes the Work of Finalizing New Loading and Unloading Tools

(Our newspaper Shanghai, January 23rd) In the mass technical revolution movement, the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Bureau has seized the work of finalizing newly created loading and unloading tools, finalizing and promoting them simultaneously, rapidly improving transportation efficiency.

In the past, this bureau relied on carrying poles, ropes, and baskets to load and unload goods, which was very inefficient. In addition, the short transportation distances and frequent loading and unloading times within the city meant that trucks spent about 35% of their total transportation time loading and unloading goods. Last year, the Party Committee of this bureau led employees to launch a technical innovation campaign centered on reforming loading and unloading tools. After a large number of employee creations emerged, the Party Committee seized the work of finalizing them. Currently, this bureau has finalized and is using six important types of loading and unloading tools: cranes for loading and unloading large machinery and equipment, forklifts for loading and unloading steel, automatic lifting platforms for loading and unloading bundled large items such as light industrial raw materials and products, automatic conveyors for loading and unloading bulk materials such as coal and sand, tonnage weighing devices, and automatic dump trucks. In this way, they have self-made, combined indigenous and foreign high-efficiency loading and unloading machinery for several major categories of goods they transport.

The bureau's finalization work also adopted a mass movement approach. Before finalizing each type of loading and unloading tool, they separately handed over similar creations to employees for sorting, evaluation, and appraisal. During this period, they also held large and small exhibitions and on-site meetings to conduct operational demonstrations and professional seminars. After widely collecting mass opinions, they organized specialized groups with the participation of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to conduct in-depth research and improvement.

Due to the concentration of mass collective wisdom, many loading and unloading tools gradually became more perfect during the finalization process. The automatic lifting platform is a cargo board installed at the rear of the vehicle that can be raised and lowered like an elevator, capable of loading and unloading a truckload in about eighteen minutes, an efficiency increase of 42% compared to manual labor. When this tool was first created, it was hand-cranked, which required high labor intensity. During the finalization period, it was gradually developed into an electric version. The car is equipped with a battery for power supply, which is charged by a small generator driven by the car's movement, providing an inexhaustible supply of power. The automatic conveyor originally had various types such as belt type, plate chain type, bucket chain type, and propeller type. The finalized version has both a conveying belt and a continuously rolling propeller, and is also equipped with digging buckets. After the machine is started, the propeller continuously feeds coal, sand, and other materials to the digging buckets, which are then transferred to the truck compartment by the belt, filling a truckload in three minutes. Using manual labor, it takes four people about twenty minutes to load a truckload.

In the recent short period of more than three months, this bureau has already promoted five hundred and one units (vehicles) of the six important loading and unloading tools. The time spent by trucks loading and unloading goods has been reduced from 35% of the total transportation time to 25%.

At the beginning of this year, this bureau seized the manufacturing and promotion of these tools, taking it as the central link in improving transportation efficiency. According to their plan, this year the time spent by this bureau's trucks loading and unloading will be reduced to 15% to 10% of the total transportation time. The transportation efficiency of vehicles will be greatly improved, and a large amount of loading and unloading labor can be saved. (Xu Shoukeng)

    总结提高群众的创造
    上海交通运输局抓紧新装卸工具的定型工作
    本报上海23日电　上海市交通运输局在群众性的技术革命运动中，对新创造的装卸工具抓紧进行定型，边定型、边推广，迅速提高了运输效率。
    这个局过去装卸货物都依靠扛棒、绳索和箩筐，效率很低，加以市内运输运距短、装卸次数多，因此卡车装卸货物的时间占到总运输时间的35％左右。这个局的党委去年领导职工开展了以改革装卸工具为中心的技术革新运动。在职工的创造大量涌现以后，党委又抓紧了定型工作。现在，这个局定型、使用的重要装卸工具已有六种：装卸大型机器设备的吊车，装卸钢材的铲车，装卸轻工业原料、轻工业制品等捆包大件的自动升降平台，装卸煤炭、砂石等散装物资的自动输送机，吨位衡量器和自动倾卸车。这样，他们运输的几类大宗货物就都有了自制的、土洋结合的高效率装卸机械。
    这个局的定型工作也采取了群众运动的方式。每种装卸工具定型前，都分别把同类的创造交给职工整理、评比和鉴定。这期间，还举行大大小小的展览会和现场会议，进行操作表演和专业座谈。在广泛收集群众意见以后，便组织有领导干部、工人和技术人员参加的专门小组深入研究和改进。
    由于集中了群众的集体智慧，不少装卸工具在定型过程中逐步趋于完善。自动升降平台是装在车后的一块货板，像电梯一样能升能降，十八分钟左右可装卸一车，效率比人力提高42％。这一工具刚创造出来是手摇的，劳动强度较高。定型期中，逐步发展成电动的。汽车上装置电瓶供电，电瓶由汽车行驶时带动的小型发电机充电，电力用之不竭。自动输送机原来有皮带式、板链式、链斗式和螺旋桨式等多种，最后定型的既有输送的皮带，又有不断卷动的螺旋桨，而且加装了挖斗。机械开动以后，螺旋桨就把煤炭、砂石等源源送给挖斗，再由皮带传递到车厢，三分钟可以装满一车。用人力，四个人装一车，需时二十分钟左右。
    在最近短短的三个多月内，这个局六种重要装卸工具已经推广了五百零一架（辆）。卡车装卸货物的时间由原来占总运输时间的35％，降低到25％。
    今年一开始，这个局又抓紧了这些工具的制造和推广工作，把它作为提高运输效率的中心一环。根据他们的规划，今年这个局卡车装卸时间将压缩到占总运输时间的15％到10％。车辆的运输效率将大大提高，而且可以节约大量装卸的劳动力。　（徐寿铿）
