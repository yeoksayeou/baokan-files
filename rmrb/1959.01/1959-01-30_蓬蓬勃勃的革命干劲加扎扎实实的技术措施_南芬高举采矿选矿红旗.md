Benxi Dispatch from our newspaper on the 29th: The Nanfen Open-Pit Iron Mine achieved a massive leap forward in production last year. Its mining intensity and the efficiency of its primary equipment have both reached the top position in the country, making it an advanced banner in mechanized large-scale mine production.

Since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, this mine has vigorously mobilized the masses to overcome weaknesses, and its mining intensity in the fourth quarter exceeded 400 tons. The annual mining intensity reached 384 tons, an 87% increase compared to 1957. Electric shovel efficiency increased to 1,350 tons, more than double the previous year. Due to the increase in these two indicators, the annual ore output jumped to 6.55 million tons, 1.8 times higher than the previous year.

The reason why the Nanfen Open-Pit Mine has achieved such great results is mainly because it has implemented the Party's General Line and responded to the great call to double steel production. It has launched mass movements in large-scale mines, constantly guiding the enthusiasm of the masses to solve key technical problems in production, and strengthening production and technical management.

Last year, the Nanfen Open-Pit Mine conducted a comprehensive analysis of the key problems in production. According to the analysis, to increase production, it was necessary to overcome conservative thinking and solve four key problems: lagging mining preparation, low truck transport efficiency, chute blockage, and low electric shovel utilization rate. The mine mobilized workers to focus on these key problems, proposing more than 20,000 rationalization suggestions, and finally solved these four major problems, greatly unleashing the mine's production potential. For example, in strengthening mining preparation work, some people believed that the ore body was narrow, the bench working line was short, and the blasting technology could not be broken through. However, after mobilizing the masses to engage in large-scale technical innovation, the labor organization form of mixed work teams was adopted, the "herringbone" mining method was implemented, the mining of the upper benches was accelerated, and new bench working faces were opened up, preparing sufficient ore volume for mining. In terms of improving equipment efficiency, the workers created a rapid loading method, and the shift output in October reached more than 2,000 tons. The crusher also accelerated its speed, and its production capacity doubled. At the same time, the truck dispatch rate also doubled.

Currently, the mine's workers are in high spirits and are launching a new production upsurge, striving for a greater production leap forward in 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, January 29th: The modernized Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant has launched a mass technical revolution, achieving a double leap forward in quality and output, and raising the national red flag for ore dressing quality and ball mill volume utilization coefficient.

Before March of last year, the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant's selected concentrate only had an iron content of about 60%, and the ball mill's hourly output per cubic meter of volume was only more than three tons, which was behind compared to advanced indicators. The main reason was that some leading cadres had right-leaning conservative thinking, opposing improving quality to increasing output and metal recovery rate, believing that improving quality would prevent increasing output, and increasing output would prevent improving quality. Some people also believed that the quality had already exceeded the original design level, and it would be difficult to improve it further. Since March of last year, this plant has combined with the rectification movement to vigorously publicize and implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction, mobilized the masses to continuously criticize these erroneous ideas, put forward the fighting slogan of "letting the blast furnace eat both full and well," and organized a comprehensive leap forward in production through large-scale technical revolution. As a result, the quality and output of ore dressing have continuously improved, breaking through the national advanced level in a short period of time. In April of last year, the iron content of the concentrate powder reached 63%, and the annual average reached 63.9%, of which it has remained above 65% since September. The annual average ball mill volume utilization coefficient reached 3.83 tons, of which it reached 4.41 tons in December. Since January of this year, these two indicators have still maintained a leading position in the country.

The improvement in ore dressing quality and output has a significant effect on increasing pig iron production in blast furnaces. Every 1% increase in the iron content of concentrate powder can increase blast furnace production by 2%. The concentrate produced by the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant is all supplied to the Benxi Iron and Steel Company for ironmaking. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has been able to maintain the national ironmaking champion title for nine consecutive months since April of last year, which is closely related to the use of high-quality concentrate (after sintering).

In the process of improving ore dressing quality and output, the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant has continuously guided the enthusiasm of the workers to technical revolution, using solid technical measures to ensure the realization of leap forward targets. In the past, a key problem hindering quality improvement in this plant was the coarse grinding particle size, and the iron components were not well separated from the impurities. At the same time, there were also some problems with equipment and operation. In the process of mobilizing the masses, the plant's leadership raised these issues for the workers to study and solve. Through continuous analysis and research, the workers have successively proposed and implemented dozens of major innovation measures, such as improving the vibrating screen, reducing the ore feeding particle size of the ball mill from the original 20 to 25 mm to 8 to 10 mm; correspondingly improving the operation technology, so that the final grinding particle size of the ball mill was greatly reduced; and reforming the ore dressing process, adding a secondary selection. In addition, electromagnetic dewatering troughs that are easy to separate iron from impurities and simple equipment for separately processing middlings (this ore has a low iron content and was originally mixed with concentrate) were also added, which significantly improved the quality of the concentrate.

    蓬蓬勃勃的革命干劲加扎扎实实的技术措施
    南芬高举采矿选矿红旗
    本报本溪29日电　南芬露天铁矿去年生产有巨大跃进，在采矿强度和主要设备效率方面，都跃居全国首位，成为机械化大型矿山生产的一面先进旗帜。
    1958年大跃进以来，这个矿由于发动群众大力克服薄弱环节，采矿强度在第四季度突破了四百吨，全年采矿强度达到三百八十四吨，比1957年度增长87％；电铲效率提高到一千三百五十吨，比上年度增长一倍多。由于这两项指标的升高，全年矿石产量跃到六百五十五万吨，比上年度增长一点八倍。
    南芬露天矿所以取得这样大的成绩，主要是由于贯彻执行了党的总路线和响应了钢产翻一番的伟大号召，在大型矿山中大搞群众运动，把群众的干劲不断引导到解决生产技术关键问题上，并且加强了生产技术管理工作。
    南芬露天矿去年曾对生产中的关键问题作了全面分析。根据分析，要提高生产，必须克服保守思想，解决采矿准备工作落后、汽车运输效率低、溜子堵塞、电铲利用率不高等四个关键问题。这个矿发动职工们围绕这些关键问题，提出了二万多件合理化建议，终于解决了这四大问题，大大发挥了全矿的生产潜力。例如在加强采矿准备工作方面，有人认为矿体狭窄，台阶工作线短，爆破技术关无法突破。但是，经过发动群众大搞技术革新以后，采用混合工作队的劳动组织形式，实行“人字形”开采方法，加速了上部台阶的开采，并且开拓了新的台阶工作面，为采矿准备好了足够的矿量。在提高设备效率方面，职工们创造了快速装车法，10月份班台效率达到二千吨以上。碎矿机也加快了转数，生产能力提高了一倍。同时，汽车出车率也提高了一倍。
    目前，这个矿的职工们情绪高昂，正在掀起新的生产高潮，争取在1959年来一个更大的生产跃进。
    新华社本溪29日电　现代化的南芬选矿厂发动群众大搞技术革命，使质量产量双双跃进，插上了选矿质量和球磨机容积利用系数的全国红旗。
    南芬选矿厂在去年3月份以前，选出的精矿含铁量只在60％左右，球磨机每小时每立方公尺容积产量也只达三吨多，同先进指标比较起来要落后。主要原因是部分领导干部有右倾保守思想，把提高质量同提高产量和金属回收率对立起来，认为提高质量就不能提高产量，提高产量就不能提高质量；也有些人认为，质量已经超过原设计水平，很难再提高了。去年3月份以来，这个厂结合整风运动，大力宣传和贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，发动群众不断地批判了这些错误思想，提出了“让高炉吃得又饱又好”的战斗口号，并且通过大搞技术革命，组织生产全面跃进，因而选矿的质量和产量都不断提高，在短期内就突破了全国先进水平。去年4月份，精矿粉含铁量达到了63％，全年平均达到63.9％，其中9月份以来一直保持在65％以上；球磨机容积利用系数全年平均达到三点八三吨，其中12月份达到四点四一吨。今年1月份以来，这两项指标仍然保持全国领先的水平。
    选矿质量和产量的提高，对于高炉增产生铁有重大作用。精矿粉含铁量每提高1％，就可以使高炉增产2％。南芬选矿厂生产的精矿，全部供应本溪钢铁公司炼铁。本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂从去年4月份以来能够连续九个月保持全国炼铁冠军称号，同使用高质量的精矿（经过烧结）有极为密切的关系。
    南芬选矿厂在提高选矿质量和产量的过程中，不断把职工群众的干劲引导到技术革命上来，用扎扎实实的技术措施，来保证跃进指标的实现。这个厂过去妨碍质量提高的一个关键问题，是磨矿粒度粗，铁的成分同杂质分离得不好；同时在设备和操作上也有些问题。在发动群众的过程中，厂的领导就提出这方面的问题让职工们研究解决。经过不断的分析研究，职工们先后提出和实现了几十件重大的革新措施，如改进了振动筛，把磨球机的给矿粒度从原来的二十到二十五公厘缩小到八到十公厘；相应地改进了操作技术，使球磨机最终磨矿粒度大大缩小；改革了选矿工艺过程，增加了一次精选。此外，还添置了易于使铁分同杂质分离的电磁脱水槽和单独处理中矿（这种矿石含铁量低，原来同精矿混在一起）的简易设备等，这样就显著地提高了精矿质量。（附图片）
