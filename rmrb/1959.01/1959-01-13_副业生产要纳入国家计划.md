Nanchang County's Maqiu Commune Produces and Supplies Large Quantities of Non-Staple Foods According to Urban Needs
Huayang County Comprehensively Arranges Sideline Production and Agricultural Product Processing for Each Commune

(Our Newspaper Nanchang, 12th) The Maqiu People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has completed the non-staple food production tasks assigned by the state both in quantity and quality, fully demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune being large and public. This once again proves the correctness of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party's policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production in people's communes.

Maqiu Commune is located between Nanchang City and Poyang Lake, rich in resources, and the masses have always had experience in engaging in diversified operations. After the establishment of the commune in September last year, the state assigned the task of producing non-staple foods to supply Nanchang City and other industrial and mining areas, that is, to produce 350,000 jin of aquatic products, 1 million jin of vegetables, 2,000 fat pigs, and 4,000 poultry and wild fowl for the state within three months. The Maqiu Commune Party Committee believed that the commune is a part of the entire national economy, and the commune's non-staple food production should also be subject to the unified leadership and planning of the state, and the completion of the state-assigned production tasks should be guaranteed first. Therefore, after the task was assigned, they led the members to conduct discussions on the special topic of whether or not to develop commodity non-staple food production. Initially, some members said that now that the commune has been established, they only need to produce what they need, and commodity production is optional. Some advocated that commodity production should be carried out only after fully meeting their own consumption needs. However, after several times of reasoning and debate, people's understanding was generally improved. Many people realized that if the commune does not engage in commodity production, on the one hand, cities and industrial and mining areas will not be able to obtain non-staple food supplies, and they will not be able to produce various agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and daily necessities for the commune; on the other hand, the commune will reduce its cash income and will not have money to purchase these things. Regarding the question of whether non-staple foods should first satisfy themselves or first supply cities and industrial and mining areas, everyone believed that without the development of the entire national economy, the production of a commune cannot be developed, and needs cannot be met. Therefore, the commune must first vigorously develop commodity production, support the state, and supply the needs of cities. After unifying ideological understanding, the commune party committee, based on the state's plan, the commune's needs, and production conditions, formulated an overall plan for the commune to develop commodity and self-sufficient non-staple food production. The plan was to produce 1.8 million jin of aquatic products, 10 million jin of vegetables, 50,000 live pigs, and 200,000 poultry and wild fowl in the entire commune within three months.

In order to ensure the completion of the plan, Maqiu Commune adopted the following measures: 1. The first secretary of the commune party committee took the lead in grasping the commune's non-staple food production and labor arrangement; the commune established a sales department, headed by a deputy secretary specifically in charge of the transportation of commodity non-staple foods. The commune party committee also sent more than ten party committee members to the front line of non-staple food production to solve problems at any time. In addition, production brigades and teams established non-staple food production command posts and stations, led by a deputy secretary of the party branch or a deputy captain to lead non-staple food production. In this way, there was leadership at all levels to ensure the implementation of the plan. 2. Rationally arrange labor, and achieve "each according to his ability." According to the commune's various production tasks, a total of 25% of the labor force, a total of 5,000 people, were drawn out and formed various professional teams such as fishing, goose hunting, lotus root digging, and pig raising according to their respective specialties. Elderly and weak members formed poultry breeding groups to raise chickens and geese. 3. Give full play to the superiority of the commune being large and public, and expand the scope of operation under the principle of collective operation as the main focus, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune's various levels of organizations and the vast number of members. The operation was expanded from the commune's sole operation in the past to five operations including communes, brigades, teams, canteens, and individual members. Among them, collective operations (communes, brigades, and teams) accounted for more than 80%. Because the number of collective operations is large, the variety is large, and the quality is also good, this part of the product is supplied to the state; the products operated by canteens and individual members are self-sufficient, and the surplus part is also supplied to the state, so as to meet the requirements of the state and the needs of the commune. 4. Broaden the avenues for sideline production, and expand from more than a dozen non-staple food production projects in the past to more than 30 projects.

After the above measures were implemented, in less than three months, the number of live pigs developed to 50,000, the number of poultry increased to 210,000, and other fishing, goose hunting, and vegetable growing have greatly increased. Due to the abundant and diverse varieties, the result was that the entire commune completed the non-staple food production task assigned by the state for the first time ten days ahead of schedule and by more than double.

Maqiu Commune also completed the state's temporary assigned non-staple food rush tasks very well. Maqiu Commune organized two permanent transportation teams with more than 500 people, and also organized a rush transportation team during the rush to ensure that the non-staple foods supplied to the state were transported to the designated sales locations in a timely manner. On December 20 last year, the state proposed to the commune to rush to transport 1,000 live pigs, 400,000 jin of fresh fish, and 1 million jin of vegetables within ten days before the Gregorian New Year to support Nanchang City to celebrate the New Year. After receiving the task, the commune immediately made arrangements and immediately organized a rush transportation team of more than 1,000 people in cooperation with the permanent transportation team, and transported all the non-staple foods transported by the state to Nanchang City within a few days.

In the development of non-staple food production, Maqiu Commune actively implemented the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production. As a result, it not only fully supplied the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas, but also increased the commune's income by more than 2 million yuan, improved the lives of the members, and increased the funds for expanding production. The members said that the development of commodity non-staple food production in the entire commune achieved "three goods", that is, it is good for supporting national construction, good for increasing commune income, and good for improving the lives of the members. (Liu Guanghui, Li Yuqing)

(Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th) The people's communes in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, have incorporated non-staple food production into the national plan by formulating purchase and sales plans and signing processing contracts with commercial departments, while also meeting their own needs for non-staple foods.

Due to the sufficient raw materials, the communes in Huayang County paid great attention to the development of workshop production after autumn, but because they did not fully understand the needs of the market, it was difficult to arrange the variety and quantity of products.

In order to promote the rapid development of workshop production, the Huayang County Party Committee paid great attention to helping solve these problems when leading the communes to formulate production plans. The county's financial and economic leading departments comprehensively arranged the tasks of agricultural product processing and non-staple food production for each commune according to the county's commodity purchase and sales plan. For some products, commercial departments also widely promoted the form of processing contracts. On this basis, the people's communes clarified their direction and made their own purchase and sales plans and arranged processing and production. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, the number of non-staple food processing workshops in the county's people's communes has increased by dozens. Recently, the communes have produced and supplied more than 500,000 jin of pickles and a large amount of vermicelli, starch, and dried vegetables to Chengdu City according to plan. The non-staple foods in the towns and townships in Huayang County are also more abundant. In the past, the county did not produce wine and sugar. Now, communes have generally established wineries and sugar mills, using sweet potatoes as raw materials to produce a large amount. Therefore, the county's supply of wine and sweets has also fundamentally changed the past situation of relying on Chengdu City for supply.

The development of workshops has also appropriately met the commune's own needs for non-staple foods. For example, Yongxing Commune in the mountainous area had fewer workshops in the past, and noodles, soy sauce, seasonings, and sweets had to be purchased from the county seat more than 100 li away. Now, the commune has built and expanded six mills and flour mills, one sauce garden, and one candy factory. In addition to completing the national plan, the products produced can also be self-sufficient to some extent.

### 副业生产要纳入国家计划

    副业生产要纳入国家计划
    南昌县麻丘公社按城市需要生产和供应大量副食品
    华阳县全面安排各个公社的副业生产和农产品加工
    本报南昌12日电　江西南昌县麻丘人民公社，对国家分配的副食品生产任务，完成得既多又好，充分显示了人民公社大而公的优越性，再一次证明了党的六中全会关于人民公社实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针的正确性。
    麻丘公社位于南昌市和鄱阳湖之间，物产丰富，群众也一向就有搞多种经营的经验。公社在去年9月份成立后，国家便分配了生产副食品供应南昌市及其他工矿区的任务，即在三个月内，给国家生产水产品三十五万斤，蔬菜一百万斤，肥猪二千头，家禽野禽四千只。中共麻丘公社党委认为，公社是整个国民经济中的一部分，公社的副食品生产也要像工农业生产一样，服从国家的统一领导和计划，并且要首先保证完成国家分配的生产任务。因此，在任务下达后，就领导社员以要不要发展商品性副食品生产为专题进行了讨论。最初，有的社员说，现在公社化了，只管生产自己需要的东西，商品生产可搞可不搞。有的主张，要在完全满足自己的消费后，再搞商品性生产。但是，经过几次的说理辩论，人们的认识普遍提高了，许多人都认识到：公社不搞商品生产，一方面城市和工矿区得不到副食品供应，便不能很好地为公社生产多种农具、化学肥料和日用品；一方面公社减少了现金收入，也就没有钱来购买这些东西。对于副食品是首先满足自己，还是首先供应城市和工矿区这个问题，大家认为，没有整个国民经济的发展，一个社的生产是不能发展的，需要也是不能满足的，因此公社必须首先大力发展商品生产，并支援国家，供应城市的需要。思想认识统一以后，公社党委根据国家的计划，本社的需要和生产条件，制定了全社发展商品性和自给性副食品生产的全盘计划。计划在三个月内全社生产水产品一百八十万斤，蔬菜一千万斤，生猪五万头，家禽野禽二十万只。
    为了保证计划的完成，麻丘公社采取了如下的措施：一、公社党委第一书记挂帅，抓全社的副食品生产和劳力安排；公社成立外销部，由一个副书记具体抓商品性副食品的调运。公社党委并派出十多名党委委员到副食品生产第一线，随时解决问题。此外，生产大队、小队都成立副食品生产指挥所、站，由一个党支部副书记或副队长领导副食品生产。这样，层层有领导，保证了计划的贯彻执行。二、合理地安排劳动力，做到“各尽所能”。根据全社各项生产任务，统一抽出25％的劳动力共五千人，按照各人的特长，分别组成捕鱼、打雁、挖藕、养猪等各种专业队。年老体弱的社员便组成家禽饲养小组，养鸡养鹅。三、充分运用公社大而公的优越性，在集体经营为主的原则下，扩大经营范围，把公社各级组织和广大社员的积极性都调动起来，由过去公社一家经营，扩大到公社、大队、小队、食堂、社员个人等五家经营。其中集体经营的（公社、大队、小队）占80％以上。由于集体经营的数量多、品种多、质量也较好，因此以这一部分产品供给国家；食堂和社员个人经营的产品自给，剩余部分也供给国家，做到既满足国家的要求，也满足本社的需要。四、广开副业门路，由过去的十多个副食品生产项目，扩大到三十多项。
    上述措施实行之后，不到三个月，毛猪发展到五万头，家禽增到了二十一万只，其他捕鱼、打雁、种菜等都有很大增长。由于产量丰富，品种多样，结果全社提前十天超额一倍完成了国家第一次分配的副食品生产任务。
    麻丘公社对国家临时分配的副食品突击任务也完成得很好。麻丘公社组织了有五百多人的两支常年运输队，突击调运时并组织突击运输队，保证及时把供应国家的副食品运到指定销售地点。去年12月20日，国家向公社提出在阳历年前十天内突击调运毛猪一千头，鲜鱼四十万斤，蔬菜一百万斤，支援南昌市过新年。公社接到任务后，马上进行了安排，立即配合常年运输队组织了一支一千多人的突击运输队，几天之内就把国家调运的副食品全部运到了南昌市。
    麻丘公社在发展副食品生产中，由于积极贯彻自给生产与商品生产并举的方针，结果，不仅充分供应了城市和工矿区的需要，还使公社增加了二百多万元的收入，改善了社员的生活，增加了扩大生产的资金。社员们说，全社发展商品性副食品生产做到了“三好”，即支援国家建设好，增加公社收入好，改善社员生活好。　　（刘光辉、李余庆）
    新华社成都12日电　四川省华阳县各人民公社，通过和商业部门制订购销计划和签订加工合同，把副食品生产纳入国家计划，同时满足了本身对副食品的需要。
    华阳县由于原料充足，秋后各公社都很注意发展作坊生产，但是因对市场需要不完全了解，对产品的品种和数量难于安排。
    为了促进作坊生产迅速发展，中共华阳县委在领导各公社制订生产规划中，十分注意帮助解决这些问题。县财经领导部门根据全县商品购销计划，全面安排了各公社的农产品加工和副食品生产任务。对部分产品，商业部门还广泛推行了加工合同的形式。在这一基础上，各人民公社方向明确了，纷纷做出本社购销计划，安排加工生产。据不完全统计，两个月来，全县各人民公社副食品加工作坊已增加了数十个。最近以来，各公社已按计划生产和供应成都市五十多万斤酱菜和大量的粉条、淀粉、干菜等。华阳县内的场镇副食品也更加充裕。过去这个县不产酒和糖，现在各公社普遍建立了酒坊、糖坊，用红苕作为原料，大量生产。因此，全县酒和糖果糕点供应也根本改变了过去依靠成都市供应的情况。
    作坊的发展，也适当地满足了公社本身对副食品的需要。如山区永兴公社，过去作坊较少，挂面、酱油、调味品和糖果等，都要往返一百多里从县城买回供应。现在，这个公社新建和扩建了六个磨房和粉房、一个酱园、一个糖果厂，生产的产品除完成国家计划外，还能自给一部分。
