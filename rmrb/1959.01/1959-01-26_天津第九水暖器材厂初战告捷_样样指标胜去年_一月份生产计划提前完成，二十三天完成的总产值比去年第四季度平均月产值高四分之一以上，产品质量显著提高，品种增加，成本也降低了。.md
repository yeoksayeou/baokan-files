    Tianjin No. 9 Plumbing and Heating Equipment Factory Achieves Initial Success
    All Indicators Surpass Last Year
    The January production plan was completed ahead of schedule, and the total output value completed in 23 days was more than a quarter higher than the average monthly output value in the fourth quarter of last year. Product quality has improved significantly, product variety has increased, and costs have also been reduced.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 25th. The workers of the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private No. 9 Plumbing and Heating Equipment Factory, based on the great leap forward last year, continued to exert their efforts, focused on practical measures, and created a good start for a greater leap forward this year. On the 23rd, this factory had already completed its January production plan ahead of schedule. The total output value completed in 23 days was more than a quarter higher than the average monthly output value in the fourth quarter of last year. Product quality has also improved significantly, product variety has increased, and costs have been reduced.
    The No. 9 Plumbing and Heating Equipment Factory produces copper and iron castings. The higher authorities requested that the factory increase production in the first quarter of this year by 25% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The factory's leading cadres initially felt that the target was too high and were afraid that the workers would not accept it. The factory's Party branch decided to hand over the target to all the factory's workers for discussion so that everyone could come up with ways to complete it. During the discussion of the target, the workers had two reactions: one was that they believed it could be completed and they would guarantee its completion, but they had no specific measures; the other was that they believed that production had reached its peak, and it would be difficult to complete a target that was even higher than the fourth quarter plan, when they were already working hard. The Party branch studied this situation and believed that the "production has reached its peak" theory was a stumbling block to a greater leap forward this year. It was decided that several leading cadres would go to the groups and discuss the national plan with the workers. The topic of discussion was whether the factory's production had reached its peak and, if there was to be another leap forward, where should they look for solutions? At the discussion, the workers recalled that during the factory's leap forward last year, some people in the factory also thought that there was not much more to be gained. However, after criticizing conservative thinking and carrying out a large-scale technical revolution, the output value completed last year increased by 1.4 times compared to the previous year. The idea that "production has reached its peak" was criticized. The workers realized that the potential for production was still great, and as long as they continued to exert their efforts and work hard and cleverly, production could continue to increase. They put forward the leap forward plan for the first quarter of this year and, around this plan, launched a wave of proposing measures and innovation suggestions. In just two days, the workers put forward 59 relatively important innovation suggestions. The workers also made a lot of efforts to overcome the shortage of raw materials. When there was not enough copper ingots, the workers went to the processing factory to collect copper powder and recast it into copper blocks. When there was not enough firewood, the workers adopted methods such as sealing the fire and cleaning the furnace in turn to save firewood. These suggestions and measures ensured the completion of the January leap forward plan.

    天津第九水暖器材厂初战告捷
    样样指标胜去年
    一月份生产计划提前完成，二十三天完成的总产值比去年第四季度平均月产值高四分之一以上，产品质量显著提高，品种增加，成本也降低了。
    新华社天津25日电　天津市公私合营第九水暖器材厂的职工，在去年大跃进的基础上，继续鼓足干劲、紧抓措施，为今年更大的跃进创造了良好的开端。23日，这个工厂已经提前完成了1月份生产计划，在二十三天中完成的总产值比去年第四季度平均月产值高出四分之一以上，产品质量也有显著提高，产品品种增加了，成本降低了。
    第九水暖器材厂是生产铜、铁铸件的。上级要求这个工厂今年第一季度的生产比去年第四季度提高25％，厂里的领导干部起初曾感到指标过高，怕工人接受不了。工厂党支部就决定把这个指标交给全厂职工讨论，让大家想办法来完成。职工们在讨论指标时，有两种反映：一种是认为可以完成，也要保证完成，可是没有什么具体措施；一种是认为生产已经到顶了，要完成比去年苦战正酣的第四季度计划再高的指标有困难。党支部研究了这个情况，认为“生产到头论”是阻碍今年更大跃进的绊脚石，就决定由几个领导干部分头到小组里去，和工人一起讨论国家计划。讨论的题目是本厂的生产是不是到头了？假使再跃进，应该从哪里想办法？在讨论会上，工人们回忆起去年全厂跃进时，厂里也有人认为没有多大油水，可是经过批判保守思想，大搞技术革命后，去年完成的产值就比前年增加一点四倍。“生产到头”的思想受到了批判。工人们认识到生产潜力还是很大的，只要继续鼓足干劲，实干苦干巧干，生产就可以不断提高。他们提出了今年第一季度的跃进计划，并围绕这个计划掀起了提措施、提革新建议的热潮，仅仅两天之内，工人们就提出了五十九件比较重要的革新建议。在克服原材料不足方面，职工也作了不少努力。铜锭不够，工人们就到加工厂去收集铜末，重新铸成铜块。劈柴不够，工人就采取封火、轮流清理炉子等办法，节约用柴。这些建议和措施，保证了1月份跃进计划的完成。
