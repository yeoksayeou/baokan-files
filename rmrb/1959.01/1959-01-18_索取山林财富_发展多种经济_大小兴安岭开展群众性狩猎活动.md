In the Yichun Forest Area of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, where "thousands of miles are frozen and ten thousand miles are covered with snow," mass hunting activities have been widely carried out. Starting from late November 1958, over 35,000 wild animals of various kinds have been captured in a month and a half, representing a 3.5-fold increase compared to the same period last year. This is an unprecedented bumper harvest in the hunting history of the Yichun Forest Area. Under the leadership of the Yichun Forest Area Party Committee, the eight people's communes in the forest area have organized more than 280 experienced old hunters and other farmers with a passion for hunting into 13 professional teams, establishing bases, patrolling the mountains and forests, and engaging in full-time hunting. Many forestry workers, government cadres, and city residents in the forest area have also participated in hunting production. During their rest periods, forestry workers put down their logging saws and pick up their hunting rifles to hunt wild animals. Forestry police team soldiers implement a combination of skiing, hunting, and shooting, with guns always in hand. In the mass hunting activities, many amateur hunting experts have emerged. Logging worker Lü Shiqin, using his spare time, hunted more than 200 chipmunks in two months. Due to the bumper harvest in hunting production, which has supported national socialist construction and improved the lives of forestry workers, employees of various forest farms can eat wild animal meat at any time. Yichun City has also opened a "Mountain Delicacies Restaurant." The masses sent a couplet to the Mountain Delicacies Restaurant: "Wild meat is available in large quantities on the market; Mountain Delicacies Restaurant is filled with customers."
The gratifying achievements in hunting production are due to the Party organization strengthening its leadership over this work. The Yichun City Party Committee has incorporated mountain production into the overall production plan, organized a Hunting Production Committee, established a Hunting Production Office, and made specific arrangements for carrying out hunting production this winter and spring:

1.  Organize professional hunters, seasonal hunters, and amateur hunters, and divide hunting areas, implementing a system of contracted responsibilities by area. At the same time, establish various systems for registration, reporting, and hunting.
2.  Adopt the method of "city contracting to district, district contracting to team, and team contracting to group" for production targets, so that tasks are clear and plans are implemented. At the same time, delegate the power to review hunter registration and approve temporary hunters entering the mountains from the city to the district.
3.  The labor remuneration for hunters participating in the commune adopts the method of fixed work points plus bonuses. Based on the general labor income of each people's commune, determine fixed points as basic work points, and then extract bonuses based on hunting income. The bonus extraction ratio is temporarily stipulated to be 20% to 50% of the total production value, with large amounts receiving smaller bonuses and small amounts receiving larger bonuses, in order to maintain the normal income of hunters.
4.  Encourage hunters to think of ways to create or improve hunting tools. When adding new tools, a portion of the timber can be used after reporting to the local forest farm for approval, based on the needs of the conditions.
5.  In order to encourage the production enthusiasm of hunters, the Municipal People's Committee issued preferential treatment certificates to hunters, providing convenience and preferential treatment in production and life. Production loans are provided through product pre-purchase to solve the funds needed by hunters for repairing and adding new tools and for living expenses. The quota standards for grain and cloth were adjusted as needed.
6.  In addition to running "Production Express Reports" to exchange experiences in a timely manner, the Municipal Hunting Office also regularly sends people to hunting areas to check and guide, study technology, summarize experience, and solve problems on the spot in a timely manner. At the same time, it strengthens publicity and education on forest protection and fire prevention, so that hunting production is combined with forest protection and fire prevention to ensure mountain and forest safety.

Through the above measures, the thoughts and steps of various departments have been unified, and the production enthusiasm of the hunters has been promoted. As a result, production equipment has been greatly expanded. For example, the number of wooden mortars has increased from the original 19,680 to 48,915, an increase of 1.5 times compared to last year; the number of various traps, guillotines, and snares has increased from the original 6,871 to 25,955, an increase of 2.8 times compared to last year; 129 new deer pits have been dug; and 80 hunting rifles and 128 hunting dogs have been added. The number of hunting personnel has also increased from the original 287 to 317, with 294 people engaged in seasonal production. Hunters throughout the city have innovated more than a dozen types of production tools. For example, hunter Zhou Xianzhis of Shuangzihe District created a flip-board deer trapping method and caught two live deer in three days.

Haila'er, this paper, January 17th. The rolling white snow has given the Greater Khingan Mountain area and the Hulunbuir grasslands a silver covering. This is a perfect season for hunters to display their skills.
In December of last year, the Chinese Communist Party's Hulunbuir League Committee convened a telephone conference, calling for hunters of all ethnicities to hunt wild fowl and beasts in large numbers to support the urban and rural people with more meat and hides. The leadership also allocated more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition to the hunters. Thousands of Oroqen, Ewenki, Daur, Mongolian, and Han hunters formed many hunting teams and groups, holding guns and riding horses, galloping across this vast forest and snow-covered wilderness, chasing various wild beasts and fowl. In Guligoulu (village), north of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Oroqen hunters just settled down. The residents there arranged food and firewood for the hunters, allowing the women, elderly, and children to live a comfortable life in the new hunter village, no longer having to follow the hunters and hunt in the mountains as they did in the past. The hunters are even more dedicated to hunting now. Oroqen youths Gaoluda (village head) and Meng Qinghai, who had recently joined the Party, led a small hunting team of more than ten people and killed more than 200 roe deer in half a month, reaping a bumper harvest. In Buteha Banner, in the central part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, there is a hunting team composed of hunters from Oroqen, Ewenki, Daur, Mongolian, and Han ethnic groups. They are members of a people's commune that was established not long ago. They help and unite each other and work very well. They have already hunted a large number of wild boars, moose, and roe deer. Tomilun, an Oroqen youth hunter who recently returned from a visit to Beijing, killed seventeen wild boars and roe deer by himself. In the past, Oroqen hunters only brought back the hides of the animals they hunted. The meat was either eaten at the time, or the rest was thrown away. Now, they transport the meat to the supply and marketing cooperative, or give it to forestry workers in the mountains. In the past, Oroqen hunters would kill deer, but now they have changed to catching live deer for breeding and raising. In this way, more valuable medicinal materials can be obtained from the deer. In order to prepare a large amount of meat for the Spring Festival, the hunting front is expanding. The Chinese Communist Party's Hailar Municipal Committee organized a hunting team of more than 250 people. They dispatched cars, horse-drawn carts, and drags, carrying hunting guns and rifles, to besiege herds of hundreds and thousands of Mongolian gazelles on the grassland. The entire Hulunbuir League plans to hunt 100,000 Mongolian gazelles and roe deer, 500 wild boars, and 68,000 wild fowl such as pheasants, sand grouse, black-bone chickens, and quail this winter and spring, totaling more than 4.2 million catties of game.

    索取山林财富　发展多种经济
    大小兴安岭开展群众性狩猎活动
    本报讯　在“千里冰封，万里雪飘”的小兴安岭伊春林区，广泛地开展了群众性的狩猎活动。从1958年的11月下旬开始，一个半月内已捕获了各种野兽三万五千多只，比去年同时期增长了三倍半。这是小兴安岭伊春林区狩猎史上空前未有的大丰收。在伊春林区党委的领导下，林区的八个人民公社，已经把经验丰富的二百八十多个老猎民和其他对狩猎爱好的农民组成了十三个专业队，设点为营，巡逻山林，专职打猎。林区有不少林业工人、机关干部和市民也参加了狩猎生产。林业工人休息时撂下伐木锯，就拿起猎枪打野生动物。林业警察队战士实行滑雪、狩猎、射击三结合，人人手不离枪，枪不离手。在群众性的狩猎活动中，出现了许多业余狩猎能手。伐木工人吕世勤，利用业余时间，在两个月内猎获灰鼠子二百多个。由于狩猎生产大丰收，既支援了国家社会主义建设，又改善了林业工人的生活，各林场职工随时可以吃到野生动物肉。伊春市还开办了一个山珍馆。群众给山珍馆送了一副对联：“野生肉大量上市，山珍馆顾客临门”。
    狩猎生产获得了可喜的成就，是由于党组织加强了对这项工作的领导。伊春市党委将山区生产纳入了整个生产规划，组织了狩猎生产委员会，设立狩猎生产办公室，并对开展去冬今春的狩猎生产作了具体的布置和安排：
    1．把专业猎民、季节性的猎民和业余狩猎者组织起来，并划分狩猎区域，实行分片包干制，同时订立登记、汇报、狩猎等各项制度。
    2．对生产指标，采取市包到区、区包到队、队包到组的办法，使任务明确，规划落实。同时将审核猎民登记、批准临时狩猎者入山的权力由市下放到区。
    3．猎民参加公社后的劳动报酬，采取固定工分加奖励的办法。按各人民公社的一般劳力所得，定出固定分数作为基本工分，然后再按狩猎所得提取奖励金，奖励金提取比例规定暂占生产总值的20％至50％，大额少奖，小额多奖。以保持猎民的正常收入。
    4．鼓励猎民人人想办法，创造或改良狩猎工具。在增添新工具时，根据条件需要，经报请当地林场批准后，也可动用一部分木料。
    5．为了鼓励猎民的生产积极性，由市人委发给猎民优待证，给予生产、生活上的便利和优待。通过产品预购，给予生产贷款，以解决猎民修理和增添新工具以及生活上需要的资金。并根据需要调整了粮食、布匹定量标准。
    6．市狩猎办公室，除举办“生产快报”及时交流经验外，还经常派人深入猎区检查指导，研究技术，总结经验，发现问题就地及时解决。同时还加强了护林防火的宣传教育，做到狩猎生产与护林防火相结合，确保山林安全。
    通过了上述各项措施，统一了各部门的思想和步调，促进了猎民的生产积极性。因而大大地扩大了生产设备，如木碓由原有一万九千六百八十盘增加到四万八千九百十五盘，比去年提高了一点五倍；各种夹子、铡、套子等由原有六千八百七十一件增加到二万五千九百五十五件，比去年提高了二点八倍；新挖了鹿窖一百二十九个；增加了猎枪八十支，猎犬一百二十八只。狩猎人员也由原有的二百八十七人发展到三百十七人，并有季节性生产的二百九十四人。全市猎民已革新生产工具十余种，如双子河区猎民周显志创造了翻板捉鹿法，在三天内就捉到了二只活鹿。

    本报海拉尔17日电　皑皑的白雪给大兴安岭山区和呼伦贝尔草原披上了银色的装束。这正是猎手们大显身手的好季节。
    年前12月间，中共呼伦贝尔盟委曾召开电话会议，号召各族猎手们大量猎取山禽野兽，支援城乡人民更多的肉食和皮张。领导上还给猎民调拨二十多万发子弹。鄂伦春、鄂温克、达斡尔、蒙古和汉族猎手数千人，组成了许多狩猎队和小组，持枪跨马，驰骋在这广阔的林海雪原上，追捕各种野兽野禽。在大兴安岭北边的古里高鲁（村）的鄂伦春猎民刚刚定居下来。那里的居民就为猎手们安排了吃的、烧的，让妇女、老人和儿童们在猎人新村里过上安适的生活，不再像过去那样跟着猎手在山林里游猎了。猎手们也更加专心地去打猎。这个村入党不久的鄂伦春青年高鲁达（村长）、孟庆海，率领一个十多人的猎民小队，在半月里打了二百多只狍子，获得了丰收。在大兴安岭中部布特哈旗有一只由鄂伦春、鄂温克、达斡尔、蒙古和汉族等猎手们组成的打猎队，他们是刚刚成立不久的一个人民公社的社员，他们互助团结，工作得很出色，已猎获了大批野猪、犴达犴和狍子。不久前从北京参观回来的鄂伦春青年猎民托米伦，一个人就打了野猪和狍子十七头。鄂伦春猎民们过去只是把猎取的兽皮带回，兽肉除自己当时吃以外，剩下的就扔了。现在都把肉运到供销社，或送给山里的林业职工。鄂伦春猎民过去是打死鹿的，现在改变为捕活鹿，加以饲养繁殖。这样就可以从鹿身上得到更多的贵重药材。为了给春节准备大量肉食，打猎的战线正在扩大。中共海拉尔市委组织了一个二百五十多人的打猎大队。出动了汽车、马车和扒犁，带着猎枪和步枪，在草原上围攻上千只和数百只的黄羊群。全呼伦贝尔盟计划一冬春猎获黄羊和狍子十万只，野猪五百口，野鸡、沙鸡、乌鸡、鹌鹑等野禽六万八千只，约计共有四百二十多万斤野味。
