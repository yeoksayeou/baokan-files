Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 25th: The Shanghai people's support for the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism is growing stronger. Today, people gave up their Sunday holiday and continued to hold rallies.

    At a rally in the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill, veteran worker Gu A'mei said passionately: On February 2, 1948, the Kuomintang army used armored vehicles manufactured by U.S. imperialism to attack our bare-handed striking workers. At that time, they seemed very fierce, but in the end, we drove them away. The struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people is not isolated. The Chinese people and progressive people all over the world are supporting them. The Cuban and Congolese people will surely achieve final victory.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 25th: Five thousand people from all walks of life in Wuhan held a meeting this afternoon to warmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for national independence and against imperialism.

    Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that we firmly support the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for national independence and freedom, and against U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialists. U.S. imperialism has recently frantically attacked the Cuban provisional government and people, attempting to prevent the Cuban government from trying Batista's murderers for their series of criminal activities. It cannot frighten the Cuban people, but can only arouse the anger of the Cuban people and peace-loving people all over the world. Li Erzhong then condemned the Belgian colonial authorities for suppressing the Congolese national independence movement.

    Also speaking at today's meeting were: Ma Xueli, Wuhan Municipal Model Worker, Su Xing, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, Du Wangao, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Li Dongqing, Director of the Wuhan Women's Federation, and Hua Yuqing, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people on behalf of their respective units and organizations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 25th: More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Chongqing held a meeting tonight to support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism and colonialism.

    Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said: The national and democratic revolutionary struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people mark a new upsurge in the national independence movement in Africa and Latin America. U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' bloody suppression of the Congolese people once again prove that imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people of the world, and the colonial system is the prison of oppressed nations. We Chinese people have suffered deeply from imperialist enslavement, and U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and coastal islands. Therefore, we have always given deep sympathy and sincere support to the people of all countries striving for national independence. We firmly advocate overthrowing the imperialist colonial system. Imperialism get out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America! No interference in Cuba's internal affairs! No killing of the Congolese people!

    Representatives of the Chongqing local organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations, representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' cruel suppression of the Congolese people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 25th: People from all walks of life in Xi'an have gathered to protest against U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' suppression of the Congolese people, and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people.

    Workers from the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory, the Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Rectifier Factory, the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory, the Xi'an Food Factory, and the Xi'an Cotton Textile Factories held various symposiums and protest rallies on the past two days. Workers spoke at the meetings, expressing their great indignation at the crimes of U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialism. At a rally attended by 7,000 people at the Shaanxi No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, advanced producer and fine yarn worker Li Fenglian said that our textile workers deeply sympathize with and firmly support the just struggle of our Cuban and Congolese brothers and sisters. We firmly believe that the people of Africa and Latin America will win their liberation just like we did.

    Students and teachers from major universities and middle schools in Xi'an also held protest rallies.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 25th: People from all walks of life in Shenyang have gathered in recent days to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonial authorities' bloody suppression of the Congolese people, and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people.

    Workers from the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, and other factories held rallies, and engineering and technical personnel from many factories held symposiums.

    At a rally attended by more than 2,000 workers from the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, city model worker and youth riveter You Zhengwen said: The Chinese people, like the Cuban and Congolese people in the past, suffered deeply from imperialist oppression, so we deeply sympathize with their suffering. Although we are separated from the Cuban and Congolese people by thousands of miles, our belief in opposing imperialism tightly connects us together.

    Residents of the Shenyang urban district also held rallies today.

    More than 6,000 commune members from the Beiling People's Commune in the suburbs are very angry at the evil activities of U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialism. Two hundred and forty-one team leaders and above who were attending meetings in the commune held separate symposiums, unanimously expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 25th: More than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Harbin gathered this morning to support the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle for national independence, and strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' crimes of massacring the Congolese people.

    Ren Zhongyi, First Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the victory of the Cuban and Congolese people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle not only marks a new upsurge in the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle for national independence, but also marks the growing strength of the world's people and revolutionary forces, and the approaching demise of imperialism and colonialism. We firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people until final victory.

    Representatives from all walks of life in Harbin also spoke at the meeting. Su Guangming, a model worker in Harbin, and Xiao Dezhi, a representative of women in Harbin, both angrily condemned the crimes of imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 25th: Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations in Fujian Province have issued statements to support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialist interference and aggression and for national independence.

    More than 900 members of 40 reading groups in the assembly workshop of the Fuzhou Power Machine Factory and the Fuzhou Cold Work Boiler Factory held symposiums, and the workers were encouraged by the victory of the Cuban and Congolese national independence movements.

    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 25th: People from all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's crimes of interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and warmly supported the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for defending national independence.

    Gongming Living Buddha, a Mongolian representative attending the first session of the Second People's Congress of the Autonomous Region in Urumqi, said: The anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people shows that the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day. We will stand together with the peace-loving people of the world and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. Yiming Mahsum, Director of the Islamic Association of the Autonomous Region, said: U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs is something that the peace-loving people of the world cannot tolerate. We Muslims of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggressive act of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. Wen Feiran, Deputy Dean of Xinjiang College, wrote a poem saying: "The east wind blows hard and the west wind wanes, victories for peace come one after another, the mad American, colonial rule is collapsing."
