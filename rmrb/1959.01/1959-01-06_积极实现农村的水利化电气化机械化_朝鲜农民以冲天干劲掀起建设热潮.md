Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: Our correspondent reports: Farmers in various parts of northern Korea are preparing for this year's agricultural production with soaring enthusiasm, actively realizing water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization. This is the scene in the Korean countryside as the National Agricultural Production Cooperative Congress, which is of great significance to the development of agriculture in Korea, opens today. Responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to expand the irrigated area by one million chongbo (one chongbo is approximately equal to fifteen Chinese mu), Korean farmers have achieved great success from the high tide of water conservancy construction that began last winter. Of the more than 7,900 small and medium-sized irrigation projects started last winter, more than 6,650 have recently completed their earthwork. Thousands of irrigation project sites distributed in the vast fields of northern Korea are full of red flags, and the farmers are working with soaring enthusiasm. When this reporter recently visited the Qingdan Irrigation Project in Haeju, South Hwanghae Province, I saw young farmers from three counties launching a vigorous labor competition. They had made many simple machines themselves, including aerial cableway cranes, ground-running handcarts, and wooden cranes that turned like scales. Recently, they launched a fast-loading and fast-transporting movement, and each person can excavate and transport twelve cubic meters of earth per day. This project started in October last winter and was originally scheduled to be completed in 1961. Now they are determined to complete all the repairs before the "May Day" holiday this year, and irrigate 20,000 chongbo of land so that 100,000 tons more rice can be harvested this year. Farmers everywhere are working like this, and they are determined to make the fields in northern Korea irrigable, except for the steeply sloping mountain fields, within two or three years, becoming cultivated land that is not afraid of drought or flood and guarantees a bumper harvest every year.

The movement to build small power stations in rural areas is developing rapidly like a prairie fire. Hundreds of small power stations have been built in each province. The small power station built by the Tousa Agricultural Cooperative in Junggang County, Jagang Province, has recently started generating electricity. This small power station with a power generation capacity of 32 kilowatts has provided electricity for 120 households in the village, and the electricity has also driven grass cutters and pulverizers, saving a lot of labor for the agricultural cooperative. Korean farmers want to have electricity in every village within one or two years.

In order to complete the mechanization of the countryside in the near future, factories in northern Korea are working hard to produce cars, tractors and various agricultural machinery to support the countryside. In addition, farmers are now launching a movement to create and use simple small machines. Various water mills and hydraulic threshing machines have been installed in various places. Local factories in various places have manufactured some ball bearings themselves, and farmers in Jagang Province and other places have recently installed ball bearings on the heavy oxcarts that have been used for countless generations. Local factories and agricultural cooperatives in various places have also self-made a large number of long-handled improved farm tools to replace the backward short-handled farm tools. This improves work efficiency and saves a lot of labor.

For this year's bumper harvest, farmers are launching a upsurge of accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing. Traveling in the fields of the Korean countryside, you can see that the fertilizer piles newly piled up by the farmers are all over the fields. In order to generally achieve a depth of 30 cm for deep plowing, farmers in various places have transformed plows into deep plows and will deep plow three times before spring sowing. In the New Sun Agricultural Cooperative in Sinchon County, Haeju, South Hwanghae Province, the reporter saw that the cooperative's high-yield experimental field had been deeply plowed to a depth of one meter.

    积极实现农村的水利化电气化机械化
    朝鲜农民以冲天干劲掀起建设热潮
    新华社平壤5日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜北部各地农民正在以冲天的干劲准备今年的农业生产，积极实现水利化、电气化、机械化。这是在朝鲜农业发展上有重大意义的全国农业生产合作社大会今天开幕时朝鲜农村的面貌。朝鲜农民响应朝鲜劳动党提出的扩大一百万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）灌溉面积的号召，从去冬掀起的兴修水利高潮，已取得很大成就。去冬开始兴修的七千九百多个中小型灌溉工程，已有六千六百五十多个在最近完成了土方工程。在朝鲜北部广大田野上分布着的数千个灌溉工程工地，到处红旗招展，农民们干劲冲天。记者最近到黄海南道青丹灌溉工程工地上访问时，看到三个郡的青年农民正在展开热火朝天的劳动竞赛，他们自己做了许多简单的机械，有空中飞的索道吊车、地上跑的手推车、像天平一样推着转的木制起重机。最近他们展开快装快运的运动，每人一天能挖运十二立方土。这个工程是在去冬10月开工的，原计划1961年完工，现在他们决心要在今年“五一”节前全部修成，放水灌溉二万町步的田地使今年就能多收十万吨稻谷。到处农民都在这样干着，他们决心要在二、三年内使朝鲜北部田地除了倾斜度很大的山坡田以外，都能灌溉，成为不怕旱涝年年保丰收的耕地。
    农村中修小型发电站的运动正在以星火燎原之势迅速地发展着。每个道都有数百个小电站建设起来。慈江道中江郡斗士农业社自己兴建的小电站最近已开始发电，这个发电量为三十二瓩的小发电站，使这个村庄的一百二十户有了电灯，电力还带动了切草机、粉碎机，为农业社节省了大量的劳动力。朝鲜的农民们要在一、二年内使村村都有电力。
    为了在不久的将来完成农村的机械化，朝鲜北部各工厂正在努力为农村生产汽车、拖拉机和各种农业机械支援农村。另外，农民们现在已展开创造和使用简单的小机械的运动。各种水磨、水力打谷机已在各地按装起来。各地的地方工厂自己制造了一些滚珠轴承，在慈江道等地的农民们最近把用了无数世代的笨重的牛车装上滚珠轴承。各地的地方工厂和农业社还自制了大批长柄的改良农具，用来代替落后的短柄的农具。这就提高了工作效率，节省了许多劳动力。
    农民们为了今年的丰收，正在展开积肥、深耕的热潮，在朝鲜农村的田野上旅行，可以看到农民们新堆起的肥料堆布满田野。为了深耕普遍达到三十公分，各地农民把犁改造成深耕犁，要在春播前深耕三遍。在黄海南道信川郡新太阳农业社里，记者看到这个社的丰产试验田深翻了一公尺。
