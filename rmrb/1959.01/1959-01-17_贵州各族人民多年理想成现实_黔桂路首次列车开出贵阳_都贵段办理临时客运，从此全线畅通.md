Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 16th. The Duyun-Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway began offering temporary passenger service yesterday. The track-laying on this section was completed on the last day of 1958.

　　At 5:20 yesterday morning, the first train carrying more than 300 guests from various ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou departed from Guiyang Station, its whistle breaking the tranquility of the mountain morning as it sped south. From now on, the ideal of the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou to travel around the country by train has become a reality.

　　This line has been providing temporary freight service since January 1, 1959. For nearly half a month, three or four freight trains have safely entered Guiyang every day. According to statistics from relevant departments of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, from the 1st to the 14th, 24,224 tons of various materials have been transported in. Among these materials are cotton from Hunan, general merchandise from Shanghai, bacterial fertilizer from Nanjing, and ammonium sulfate from Jilin, as well as various types of steel and machinery urgently needed for industrial construction and production transported from Anshan, Shenyang, and other places. Guizhou Province has also transported a large number of local specialties and mineral products to all parts of the country.

　　The opening of this section of railway was a full half-year ahead of the original plan. This is because the workers who built this railway created favorable conditions for early opening during the construction process. They widely adopted advanced construction methods and accelerated the construction progress while ensuring the quality of the project.

　　The Qian-Gui Railway is the first railway leading to Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. Because its starting station is connected to the Xiang-Gui Line, which is part of the national railway system, the remote mountainous areas of Guizhou can be closely connected with all parts of the country. In this way, the various local specialties and industrial raw materials abundant in Guizhou will no longer have to worry about being unsalable nationwide due to traffic congestion. At the same time, the industrial products and construction equipment needed by the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas to develop production can also be transported in continuously. Therefore, the rapid opening of this railway will not only accelerate the exchange of goods throughout the country but also greatly promote the development of industry and agriculture in Guizhou.

　　The Qian-Gui Railway is 605 kilometers long. It starts in Liuzhou City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and ends in Guiyang City, the capital of Guizhou Province. Among these sections, the Liuzhou to Jinchengjiang section was built before liberation; the Jinchengjiang to Duyun section was a restoration project and was opened to traffic at the end of 1956; the Duyun to Guiyang section is a new construction project with a total length of 145 kilometers.

### 贵州各族人民多年理想成现实  黔桂路首次列车开出贵阳  都贵段办理临时客运，从此全线畅通

    贵州各族人民多年理想成现实
    黔桂路首次列车开出贵阳
    都贵段办理临时客运，从此全线畅通
    新华社贵阳16日电　黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳段昨天开始办理临时客运。这段线路是在1958年最后一天完成铺轨任务的。
    昨天上午五点二十分，载着三百多个贵州山区的各族客人的首次列车，从贵阳站出发，鸣着汽笛，划破了山区早晨的宁静，向南方急驰而去。从此，贵州各族人民坐火车周游全国各地的理想，变成现实了。
    这条线路从1959年元旦起，就开始了临时货运工作。近半月来，每天都有三、四次货车安全驶入贵阳。据贵阳铁路局有关部门的统计，从1日到14日，已运进各种物资二万四千二百二十四吨。在这些物资中，有来自湖南的棉花，上海的日用百货，南京的细菌肥料和吉林的硫酸铵，还有从鞍山、沈阳等地运来的工业建设和生产上急需的各种钢材、机器。贵州省也向全国各地运送了大批的土特产和矿产品。
    这一段铁路通车时间整整比原计划提前了半年，这是因为修建这段铁路的工人们，在修建过程中为提前通车创造了良好的条件，都广泛采用了先进的施工方法，在保证工程质量的情况下，加快了施工进度。
    黔桂铁路是通往贵州省会贵阳的第一条铁路。这条铁路由于它的起点站是连接构成全国铁路体系之一的湘桂线，这就使地处边远的贵州山区能同全国各地紧密地联系起来。这样，贵州盛产的各种土特产和工业原料，从此再不愁因交通阻塞而不能畅销全国。同时，山区各族人民所需的工业品和发展生产的建设器材，也能源源运来。因此，这条铁路的迅速通车，不仅能加速全国各地的物资交流，而且对发展贵州的工农业生产将起很大的促进作用。
    黔桂铁路共长六百零五公里。它起于广西僮族自治区的柳州市，终于贵州省的省会贵阳市。这条线路中，柳州到金城江一段是解放前修的；金城江到都匀段是修复工程，已在1956年底通了车；都匀到贵阳段是新建工程，全长一百四十五公里。
