Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 13th: Miyamoto Kenji, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in the January issue of "Zenei" magazine entitled "The Focus of the Struggle for Peace and Independence," pointing out that crushing the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to revise the "Security Treaty" is the central task of Japan's current struggle.

    The article stated that the Japanese people, in their struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," have already recognized the close relationship between the conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." At the National Convention for Opening the Deadlock in Japan-China Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, held on October 28th last year, the slogan "Demand the abolition of the 'Security Treaty' and oppose the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan 'Joint Defense Treaty'" was adopted. The Socialist Party congress and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) gatherings have also stipulated that the "Security Treaty" issue will be an important goal for future struggles.

    The article discussed the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to use terms such as the United States having a defense "obligation" to Japan and "joint defense" to cover up its conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The article pointed out that the United States uses the pretext of having a defense "obligation" to Japan to make Japan recognize the status quo of U.S. troops stationed in Japan and continuing to occupy Japan. At the same time, it is precisely on the basis of this "obligation" that the United States is instigating Japan to revive militarism and implement new adventurous policies of militarists. In this way, just as the United States can use the "U.S.-Chiang Treaty" as an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs and expand its aggression against China, when the behavior of Japanese fishing boats intruding into other countries' territorial waters to engage in espionage is discovered and stopped, the United States can also use the "obligation" to "defend" Japan as an excuse to actively carry out military intervention and provoke wars that intensify international tensions.

    The article pointed out that the so-called U.S.-Japan "joint defense" actually increases the danger of Japan serving as cannon fodder for U.S. aggressive wars. At the same time, the United States can use this to promote the further revival of militarism in Japan, modernize the Japanese army, and openly carry out nuclear armament.

    In the article, Miyamoto Kenji called on the Japanese people not only to demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," but also to intensify the struggle to crush the San Francisco Treaty system. The article said that driving out the imperialist rulers and realizing Japan's independence is a basic condition for peace. Allowing imperialist aggression and allowing its military bases to exist is not only an infringement of national sovereignty, but also allows imperialists to prepare for war (currently to carry out nuclear armament), thereby threatening peace. Therefore, as far as Japan is concerned, the most serious and urgent task at present is to clarify the relationship between peace and independence, and to struggle for peace and independence. The current struggle to crush the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is the focus of the struggle for peace and independence.

    The article concluded by pointing out that among the Japanese people, there are 34 million people who have signed petitions demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, a vast peace force; there is the fighting will of millions of people who oppose revising the "Police Duties Execution Law" and safeguard democratic rights; and there is the strength of workers and peasants who are repeatedly waging tenacious struggles to protect their livelihoods. If all these various aspirations and demands are gathered in a united front demanding peace, independence, democracy, and the protection of livelihoods to carry out the struggle, then victory belongs to the people. If the Japanese Communist Party can unite all patriotic and democratic forces to fight in the work of promoting and organizing the national democratic united front, then victory will surely belong to the Japanese people.

    粉碎日美“安全条约”
    坚决争取和平独立
    宫本显治谈日本人民当前斗争任务
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治在1月号“前卫”杂志上发表题为“争取和平与独立的斗争的焦点”的文章指出，粉碎美日反动派修改“安全条约”的阴谋是日本当前斗争的中心任务。
    文章说，日本人民在反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的斗争中，已经认识到修改“警职法”和修改日美“安全条约”阴谋的紧密关系。在去年10月28日举行的打开日中关系的僵局和禁止核武装国民大会上采纳了“要求废除‘安全条约’、反对缔结日美‘共同防卫条约’”的口号。在社会党大会和日本工会总评议会的集会上也规定把“安全条约”问题作为今后重要斗争的目标。
    文章谈到岸信介政府企图用美国对日本负有防卫“义务”和“共同防卫”等名词来掩盖它修改美日“安全条约”的阴谋。文章指出，美国用对日本负有防卫“义务”的口实使日本承认美军驻留日本和继续侵占日本的现状。同时美国正是以这种“义务”为依据怂恿日本复活军国主义和执行军国主义分子的新的冒险政策。这样，美国就可以像利用“美蒋条约”为借口干涉中国内政和扩大对中国的侵略活动一样，当日本渔船侵入别国领海进行间谍活动的行为被发觉和被制止的时候，美国也可以用对日本“防卫”负有“义务”为借口积极进行军事干涉，挑起加紧国际紧张局势的战争。
    文章指出，所谓日美“共同防卫”，实际上是要增加日本替美国侵略战争充当炮灰的危险。同时，美国可以借此来促进日本进一步复活军国主义使日本军队现代化并且公开进行核武装。
    宫本显治在文章中号召日本人民不仅要求废除日美“安全条约”，而且要加紧展开粉碎旧金山和约体制的斗争。文章说，赶走帝国主义统治者、实现日本的独立是和平的基本条件。允许帝国主义者的侵略、允许它的军事基地存在，这不仅是侵犯了国家的主权，也是允许帝国主义者进行战争准备（目前是进行核武装）从而威胁和平。因此，就日本而言目前最严重的紧急任务是明确和平和独立的关系，并且为争取和平和独立而进行斗争。目前粉碎修改日美“安全条约”阴谋的斗争，就是争取和平与独立的斗争的焦点。
    文章最后指出，在日本人民当中，有三千四百万人签名要求禁止核武器的广大的和平力量，有反对修改“警察官职务执行法”维护民主权利的千百万人的战斗意志，有为了维护生活而反复进行着顽强斗争的工人和农民的力量。如果把所有这些各种各样的意愿和要求集结在要求和平、独立、民主和维护生活的统一战线中进行斗争的话，胜利是属于人民的。日本共产党如果能够在推动组织民族民主统一战线的工作中团结所有爱国的民主力量进行斗争，那末胜利一定属于日本人民。
