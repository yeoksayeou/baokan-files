    Waiting a Little Longer Doesn't Matter
    On the evening of December 4th last year, my child suddenly developed a high fever. I carried the child and got into Chen Yingjie's tricycle to go to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College. Comrade Chen saw that the child was seriously ill and followed me to the emergency room. After examination by the doctor, the preliminary diagnosis was acute meningitis, and after laboratory confirmation, he had to be transferred to the infectious disease hospital. When Chen Yingjie heard this, he said to me: "It is already late at night, and if the child is to be transferred to another hospital, I am afraid it will be difficult to find a car. I will wait outside." It was very windy at the time, and he was wearing thin clothes. We felt very sorry and asked him not to wait. Comrade Chen resolutely said:
  "Saving the child's life is important, waiting a little longer doesn't matter. Besides, I won't be able to sleep if I don't finish this matter." He waited until after two o'clock in the middle of the night, when the doctor said that the child would not be transferred, and then he rode his tricycle home. (Hu Yaohua)

    多等一下不要紧
    去年12月4日晚上，我的小孩突然发高烧。我抱着孩子坐上陈英杰的三轮车，到武汉医学院第二附属医院去。陈同志看见小孩病重，也跟着到了急诊室。经医生检查，初步诊断是急性脑膜炎，化验证实后要转到传染病院去。陈英杰一听就对我说：“现在已经是深更半夜了，如果小孩要转院，恐怕找不到车子，我就在外面等好了。”当时风很大，他穿的单薄，我们很过意不去，要求他别等了。陈同志坚决地说：
  “救小孩的命要紧，多等一下不要紧。再说我不办完这件事，回去也睡不着。”他一直等到后半夜两点多钟，医生说小孩不转院了，才踩着车子回去。（胡耀华）
