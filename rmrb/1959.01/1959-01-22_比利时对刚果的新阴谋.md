Belgium's New Conspiracy Against the Congo
Yao Chang

Belgian Congo has always been called the "only stable oasis" by the West, and the Belgian colonial authorities have also boasted that the Congo is a "model" of colonial rule, claiming that "the Congo can avoid the problems that plague other parts of Africa." However, the heroic anti-colonialist actions of the Congolese people that erupted on January 4th shattered these self-deceiving "myths." This action by the Congolese people directly supported the recently held "All-African People's Conference" and encouraged the burgeoning anti-colonialist struggle.

Belgium's eighty years of plunder and exploitation of the Congo have been extremely brutal. According to incomplete statistics: since 1887, half of Belgium's investments in the Congo have been plundered locally, and by 1956 this ratio had reached 64%. In 1955, the net profit income of Belgian companies was 26.4 billion Belgian francs (approximately US$530 million), of which 8.1 billion (one-third) came from the Congo. In the first ten months of 1957, the net profit obtained by 366 Belgian companies in the Congo reached 11 billion Belgian francs, while their total capital was only 28.5 billion Belgian francs; the capital of "Union Minière du Haut-Katanga" was only 5 billion Belgian francs, but its profit in the six years from 1950 to 1955 reached 28 billion Belgian francs.

Looking at the distribution of national income, in 1957, the national income of the Congo was 49 billion Belgian francs, of which 26.5 billion was earned by Congolese residents and 22.9 billion was earned by Europeans, that is, 1% of Europeans obtained nearly half of the national income (12 million Congolese people versus only 100,000 Europeans).

The exploitation rate of Congolese blacks by Belgium is 1250%, and the average wage difference between blacks and whites is 64 times. As for the atrocities and massacres of the Congolese people by Belgium, they are even more appalling. During Belgium's eighty years of rule, the Congolese population not only did not increase but was reduced by more than ten million, causing the Congolese population to drop from 30 million in 1884 to the current ten million. An average of 220,000 people were harmed and massacred each year.

The United States intervened in the Congo during World War II, and after the war actively expanded its investments, averaging $80 million annually in recent years. It plundered 90% of the Congo's total uranium production, and other nuclear materials such as cobalt and lithium were also monopolized by the United States. A large amount of American capital has infiltrated Belgian companies and has already controlled one-third of the shares of Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, which effectively controls the Congo. The United States' trade with the Congo has also jumped to second place, accounting for 24% of the Congo's imports and exports (Belgium accounts for 35%). Eisenhower once publicly declared: "I really can't understand what we would do without the Congo?"

While Belgian and American colonialists were cruelly plundering the Congolese people, a proletariat of 1.4 million people emerged in the Congo, and they are the strongest force against colonialism.

In order to deceive the Congolese people, Belgium has had to make certain concessions in form. The Belgian authorities held deceptive municipal elections in the Congo in December 1957. However, contrary to expectations, none of the "favorites" designated by the Belgian authorities were elected. Candidates from the Congolese nationalist organization "Abako" won 129 of the 170 parliamentary seats, and on May 9, 1958, the ten "Abako" councilors who were elected were also elected as district chiefs of the capital. Ignoring the repeated warnings from the Belgian authorities, they put forward the demand for the independence of the Congo. The deceptive measures of the Belgian authorities not only failed to achieve the goal of deceiving the Congolese people but instead made the increasingly awakened Congolese people even more dissatisfied with Belgian colonial rule. The Congolese people's call for independence is rising.

The riots in Léopoldville that broke out on January 4th were from the beginning a nationalist movement with a clear political hue, demanding independence and opposing racial discrimination. As soon as the incident occurred, the Belgian government wanted to quickly suppress the movement by force. Police and troops used machine guns to strafe African residents who were demonstrating. The Belgian government also dispatched tanks, armored vehicles, and paratroopers to strengthen the suppression, carried out large-scale searches, arrested 300 Africans, detained 96 Africans, and also declared the "Abako" organization illegal, and arrested the leader of the "Abako" organization, Kasa-Vubu, and some members on the grounds of "inciting racial hatred and participating in illegal meetings." The Governor-General of the Belgian Congo even threatened: "Any demonstrations in the future will be dealt with resolutely and forcefully." But the Congolese people's anti-colonial sentiment was far stronger than the colonial authorities had estimated. Even after the Belgian government took these high-pressure measures, incidents of attacking colonialists continued to occur in the Congolese capital and other cities. The nine African district chiefs of Léopoldville passed a resolution to the Belgian authorities, expressing "firm support for the Congolese people's legitimate desire to strive for independence and a socially just society without racial discrimination," and demanded "an immediate end to the military occupation of Léopoldville" and "modification of the dismissal of Kasa-Vubu."

The Congolese incident caused a great shock in Belgium. Faced with the strong resistance of the Congolese people and the pressure from the people at home, the Belgian government had to make a gesture of willingness to reconsider the Congolese issue. On January 8th, the parliament held an extraordinary meeting to specifically discuss the Congolese incident. In order to quell the Congolese people's anger, the parliament had to decide to send a parliamentary delegation (composed of four Catholic Social Party members, two Liberal Party members, and three Socialist Party members) to the Congo for investigation. On January 13th, the Belgian government submitted a statement to the parliament on the future of the Congo. The content was empty. It only said that it intended to make Belgian Congo a democratic country "capable of exercising sovereignty and determining its own independence." It did not propose a date for independence, nor did it mention the steps for independence. It only mentioned that "all Congolese people will have the right to vote, and the new provincial councils will be formed before March 1960."

The Belgian government's statement did not, in essence, make any concessions to the Congolese people. Due to the increasing pressure of international public opinion and the Congolese people's persistence in their just struggle, in addition to continuing military suppression, deception and divisive tactics will occupy a more important position in Belgium's policies. The specific practices may be: (1) Using and cultivating a group of Congolese national traitors, establishing some pro-government parties, and controlling the parliament. After the Belgian government issued the above-mentioned deceptive statement, Lumumba, the leader of the "Congolese National Movement," had already expressed "satisfaction" with the statement, supported the Belgian government's statement that the Congo still needs a "certain period of transition" to achieve independence, and falsely accused "Abako" as a "fervent religious movement against the Congo"; (2) Adopt the old trick of "divide and rule" by colonialists to attack and divide the Congolese people. The words spoken by the Belgian King on the radio on January 13th, in which he said that he intended to "greatly decentralize administrative power in the Congo... and diversify it according to its geographical, cultural, and ethnic characteristics and its economic development," imply this meaning, and this is worthy of attention.

The United States has maintained a tacit attitude on the surface towards this Congolese incident, with no official comments. But in fact, the United States supports the actions of the Belgian colonialists. For example, "The New York Times" stated that Belgium's actions have "shown the prospect of complete independence" to the Congolese people. The reason why the US government does not publicly come forward to support this is simply to make it easier to intervene in the Congo in the future, and Belgium's activities to suppress and divide the Congolese national independence movement also maintain the interests of the United States in the Congo.

The Congolese incident means that under the encouragement of the rising tide of anti-colonialism in Asia and Africa, the Congolese people have awakened. There are no more "stable oases" for the imperialists on the African continent. The current struggle is only the beginning. No matter whether the imperialists use military suppression or division and deception, they cannot prevent the awakening of the Congolese people. The storm has risen, and a bigger storm is yet to come.

    比利时对刚果的新阴谋
    姚昌
    比属刚果一向被西方称为“唯一安定的绿洲”，比殖民当局也吹嘘刚果是殖民统治的“典范”，并宣称“刚果能避免非洲其他部分所患的毛病”。然而，1月4日爆发的刚果人民反殖民主义的英勇行动却使得这些自欺欺人的“神话”破灭了。刚果人民这一行动直接支持了最近召开的“非洲人民大会”，鼓舞了正在蓬勃发展的反殖民主义斗争。
    八十年来比利时对刚果的掠夺和剥削是极其残酷的。据不完全统计：从1887年开始，比利时在刚果投资的半数是在当地搜刮的，到1956年这个比数已达到了64％。比利时公司1955年的纯利收入是二百六十四亿比利时法郎（约合五点三亿美元），其中八十一亿（三分之一）来自刚果。1957年头十个月，比利时在刚果的三百六十六家公司所获纯利达一百一十亿比利时法郎，而其资本总合只有二百八十五亿比利时法郎；“加丹加联合矿业公司”资本不过五十亿比利时法郎，1950—1955六年内获利达二百八十亿比利时法郎。
    再从国民收入分配来看，1957年刚果国民收入为四百九十亿比利时法郎，其中二百六十五亿为刚果居民所得，二百二十九亿为欧洲人所得，即占1％的欧洲人获得了将近一半的国民收入
  （刚果人一千二百人，欧洲人只有十万人）。
    比利时对刚果黑人的剥削率是1250％，黑人和白人平均工资差额是六十四倍。至于比利时对刚果人民的残害屠杀，更是骇人听闻。在比利时八十年的统治中，刚果人口不仅未增加反而被消灭了一千几百万人，使刚果人口由1884年的三千万降为现在的一千几百万。平均每年被残害和屠杀二十二万人。
    美国是在第二次世界大战中插足刚果的，战后积极扩大投资，最近几年平均每年投资达八千万美元。它掠夺了刚果全部铀产量的90％，其它如钴、锂等核原料也全为美国垄断。美国资本大量渗入比利时公司，并已经控制了实际上控度刚果的加丹加联合矿业公司三分之一的股票。美国对刚果的贸易也跃居第二位，占刚果进出口的24％（比利时占35％）。艾森豪威尔就曾公开声明说：“我真不能理解，如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办？”
    在比、美殖民主义残酷掠夺刚果人民的同时，刚果出现了一支一百四十万人的无产阶级队伍，他们是一支反殖民主义的最坚强的力量。
    为了欺骗刚果人民，比利时不得不作出某些形式上的让步。比利时当局于1957年12月在刚果举行了欺骗性的市政选举。然而事与愿违，比利时当局指定的“宠儿”没一个当选，刚果民族主义组织“阿巴科”的候选人在一百七十个议会席位中获得了一百二十九个，而1958年5月9日，“阿巴科”当选的十名议员又当选为首府的区长。他们不顾比利时当局的一再警告，提出要求刚果独立的主张。比利时当局的欺骗措施，不仅没有达到欺骗刚果人民的目的，反而使得日益觉悟了的刚果人民对比利时的殖民统治更加不满。刚果人民要求独立的呼声，日益高涨。
    1月4日爆发的利奥波德维尔的暴动，从一开始便是具有鲜明政治色采的、要求独立、反对种族歧视的民族主义运动。事件刚一发生，比利时政府本想迅速以武力把运动镇压下去。警察军队用机关枪扫射示威游行的非洲居民。比利时政府又派遣了坦克、装甲车和降落伞部队去加强镇压，大肆搜查，逮捕了三百名非洲人，拘留了九十六名非洲人，此外并宣布“阿巴科”组织为非法，并以“煽动种族仇恨和参加非法会议”为由逮捕了“阿巴科”组织的领袖卡萨·武布和一些委员。比属刚果总督更威吓说：“今后任何示威游行都将遭到坚决有力的对待”。但是刚果人民反殖民主义的情绪远比殖民当局估计的要强烈的多。就在比利时政府采取了这些高压手段后，刚果首府和其它城市仍不断发生袭击殖民者事件。利奥波德维尔的九位非洲人区长通过一项致比利时当局的决议，表示“坚决地支持刚果人民争取独立和争取没有种族歧视的社会正义的合法愿望”，并要求“立刻停止对利奥波德维尔的军事占领”和“修改对卡萨·武布撤职处分”。
    刚果事件在比利时国内引起了很大震动。面对着刚果人民的强烈反抗和国内人民的压力，比利时政府不得不作出表示愿意重新考虑刚果问题的姿态。1月8日议会召开了临时会议，专门讨论刚果事件，为了平息刚果人民的怒焰，议会不得不决定派遣议会代表团（由四名天主教社会党，二名自由党，三名社会党组成）赴刚果调查。1月13日比政府向议会提出关于刚果前途的声明，内容空洞，只说打算使比属刚果成为一个“能够行使主权和决定自己的独立”的民主国家，既末提出独立的日期，也未提及独立的步骤。只提到让“刚果所有人都有投票权，各省的新议会在1960年3月以前组成。”
    比利时政府的声明，在实质上并未对刚果人民作出任何让步。由于国际公正舆论的压力越来越大，刚果人民坚持正义斗争，比利时政府除了继续实行军事镇压以外，欺骗和分化手法在比利时的政策中将占着更加重要的地位。其具体做法可能是：（一）利用和培养一批刚果的民族叛徒，建立一些御用的党派，控制议会。在比利时政府发表了上述欺骗的声明后，刚果“民族运动组织”领袖卢蒙巴就已经表示对该项声明“感到满意”，支持比利时政府关于刚果获得独立还需“一定时期的过渡”的说法，并诬“阿巴科”为“反刚果的热烈的宗教运动”；（二）采用“分而治之”的殖民主义者的老手段，以打击和分裂刚果人民。比利时国王1月13日在广播中所说的他打算在刚果“把行政权大大分散……并按照它们的地理、文化和种族特点以及它们的经济发展使其多样化”的话就暗含此意，这是值得注意的。
    美国对这次刚果事件表面上保持缄默态度，官方不加任何评论。但实际上美国是支持比利时殖民者的作法的。如“纽约时报”就表示比利时的作法已在刚果人民面前“展示出完全独立的前景”。美官方之所以不公开出面支持，只是为了今后更便于插足刚果，而比利时镇压和分化刚果民族独立运动的活动，同时也就是维护了美国在刚果的利益。
    刚果事件意味着：在亚非大陆日益高涨的反殖民主义的浪潮的鼓舞下，刚果人民已经觉醒了。在非洲大陆上对帝国主义者已经没有什么“安定的绿洲”了。目前的斗争还仅仅是一个开始。不管帝国主义者使用武力镇压或是分化欺骗，都不能阻止刚果人民的觉醒。风暴已经起来了，更大的风暴还在后头。
