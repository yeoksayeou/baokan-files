Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 9th. Two African leaders, in separate interviews with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 8th, praised the Congolese people's resistance to colonial rule as a sign of the awakening of the African lion and called on African people to support the Congolese people.

Kivánuka, chairman of the Uganda National Congress, who is leaving for home tonight, said, "The people of Uganda are greatly encouraged by what is happening in the Congo at the moment. I believe this resistance will greatly help the rise of the African independence movement. Now, the sleeping lion is beginning to awaken. I think this is caused by the new spirit of nationalism. Nationalism is gaining momentum in Africa."

Mumi, chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, said: "The Congo issue is not just a colonial issue, it is an issue for the entire Africa. All African people and all freedom-loving people in the world should support the Congolese people by all means. The Congolese resistance has undoubtedly been encouraged by the anti-imperialist call of the Cairo Conference and the recent Accra Conference. This is entirely due to the internal cause of the increasingly intensified oppression of imperialism, because revolution can neither be exported nor imported. Every African wants freedom, but people can only show their strength when they are organized. People usually think that the Congo is the most deeply asleep place in Africa. The rise of the Congo is a sign of the awakening of the African lion. The Congolese resistance may not succeed this time, but in the near future, they will succeed.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th. Accra Message: A spokesperson for the Standing Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference here announced on the 8th that the Secretariat will send people to the capital of the Belgian Congo to investigate the residents' resistance to colonial rule there.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th. Léopoldville Message: Nine African district chiefs in Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, passed a resolution to the Belgian Governor-General on the 8th, strongly protesting the Belgian colonial army's bloody massacre of African residents. The resolution stated "firm support for the legitimate aspirations of the Congolese people for independence and for social justice without racial discrimination."

The resolution warned the Belgian colonial authorities that "the current calm is only a superficial phenomenon" after the colonial army brutally and bloodily suppressed the residents of the Congolese capital who recently engaged in resistance. Congolese African residents are prepared to sacrifice everything to achieve their legitimate aspirations.

The resolution demanded that the Belgian colonial authorities immediately publish a list of all the victims in this incident, immediately stop the military occupation of Léopoldville, and shorten the curfew hours. The resolution also called for the release of Kasavubu, one of the leaders of the Congolese movement for national independence and one of the district chiefs of Léopoldville, because Kasavubu's arrest has caused new discontent among African residents.

Currently, the situation in Léopoldville is still tense. The Belgian colonial authorities are still panicked, and the martial law declared since the 5th continues to be in effect. Armed military police equipped with tanks and armored vehicles rush through the streets day and night; they interrogate every pedestrian after dark and open fire indiscriminately. The various districts in the city are still blocked by barbed wire.

It is reported that in the large-scale resistance action that lasted for more than three days by African residents, at least 175 people were brutally shot and killed by the Belgian colonial army, and hundreds were injured. In addition, hundreds of African residents were arrested, including Kasavubu and Kanza, two leaders of the "Abako" association, a political organization of Congolese African residents striving for national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th. According to TASS, Brussels, January 9th: According to news from the Belgian Congo, the public in the Belgian colony continues to angrily protest the Belgian colonial authorities' bloody persecution of participants in the anti-colonialist struggle in Léopoldville. The guiding committee of the "Congo National Movement Party" condemned the Belgian authorities' cruel suppression of the participants in the Léopoldville struggle and demanded that the Belgian parliament establish a commission to investigate the recent incidents and hold those who have committed crimes accountable.

According to Agence France-Presse, the chairman of the Kalamu residential area city council condemned Belgium's policy because this policy "does not recognize the people's right to self-determination at a time when the entire Africa is moving forward along the road to liberation."

The struggle of the people of the Belgian Congo has received the sympathy and support of the people of other African countries. The "Ghana Times" wrote: "It would be very absurd for Belgian and Portuguese imperialists to hope that Africans under Belgian and Portuguese trusteeship would be inactive and submissive when their brothers under British and French imperialist rule break free from hateful slavery."

    刚果的奋起再次显示非洲雄狮觉醒
    非洲民族运动领袖号召非洲人民支持刚果人民斗争
    刚果首府九位区长表示刚果人民争取独立不惜牺牲
    新华社开罗9日电　两位非洲领袖8日在分别接见新华社记者时赞扬说，比属刚果人民反抗殖民统治的行动是非洲狮子觉醒的迹象，并且号召非洲人民支持刚果人民。
    今天晚上动身回国的乌干达国民大会党主席基瓦努卡说：“乌干达人民由于目前在刚果发生的事情而感到极大的鼓舞。我认为这次反抗行动对于非洲独立运动的高涨将大有帮助。现在，沉睡中的狮子开始觉醒了。我认为这是民族主义的新精神所造成的。民族主义正在非洲得势。”
    喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米说：“刚果问题不仅仅是一个殖民地的问题，它是整个非洲的问题。全体非洲人民和世界上一切爱好自由的人民应当用一切方法来支持刚果人民。刚果的反抗行动，无疑受到了开罗会议和最近的阿克拉会议的反帝号召的鼓舞。这完全是由于帝国主义日益加紧的压迫这个内因所造成的，因为革命是既不能输出，也不能输入的。每一个非洲人都希望自由，但是人民只有组织起来才能够表现出他们的力量。人们通常认为，刚果是非洲睡得最沉的地方。刚果的奋起是非洲狮子觉醒的迹象。刚果的反抗行动，这一次也许不会成功，但是在不久的将来，他们是会成功的。
    新华社9日讯　阿克拉消息：这里的全非人民大会常设秘书处的一位发言人8日宣布，秘书处将派人到比属刚果首府去调查那里的居民反抗殖民统治的行动。
    新华社9日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔市的九名非洲籍区长8日通过一项致比利时总督的决议，对比利时殖民军血腥屠杀非洲居民的行为提出强烈抗议。决议表示“坚决支持刚果人民要求独立和要求没有种族歧视的社会正义的合法愿望。”
    决议警告比利时殖民当局说，在殖民军对最近进行反抗行动的刚果首府居民实行残暴血腥镇压后所出现的“目前的平静只是一种表面现象”，刚果非洲居民准备不惜一切牺牲来达到自己的合法愿望。
    决议要求比利时殖民当局立即公布这次事件中全部被害者名单，立即停止对利奥波德维尔市的军事占领并且缩短宵禁时限等。决议还要求释放被逮捕的刚果争取民族独立运动的领导人之一、利奥波德维尔市区长之一卡萨武布，因为卡萨武布被捕一事已经在非洲居民中引起新的不满。
    目前利奥波德维尔市内仍然处于紧张状态。比利时殖民当局仍然是惊魂未定，从5日起宣布的戒严令仍在继续生效。配备有坦克和装甲车的武装军警日夜在大街上横冲直闯；他们在天黑以后盘问每一个行人，并且不问青红皂白地开枪。市内各区仍然拦着铁丝网。
    据报道，在非洲居民持续了三天多的大规模反抗行动中，至少有一百七十五人惨遭比利时殖民军枪杀，数百人受伤。另外还有数百名非洲居民横遭逮捕，其中包括刚果非洲居民争取民族独立的政治组织“阿巴科”协会的两位领袖卡萨武布和坎扎。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔9日讯：据来自比属刚果的消息，比利时殖民地的公众继续愤怒地抗议比利时殖民当局对利奥波德维尔反殖民主义斗争参加者的血腥迫害。“刚果民族运动党”指导委员会谴责比利时当局残酷镇压利奥波德维尔斗争的参加者，要求比利时议会成立一个调查最近事件的委员会，来追究犯有罪行的人。
    据法新社报道，卡拉穆居民点市议会主席谴责比利时的政策，因为这个政策“在整个非洲都沿着解放的道路前进的时候不承认人民的自决权”。
    比属刚果人民的斗争得到了非洲其它国家人民的同情和支持。“加纳时报”写道：“对于比利时和葡萄牙帝国主义者来说，如果希望在比利时和葡萄牙托管之下的非洲人，在他们的在英国和法国帝国主义统治下的兄弟挣脱可恨的奴役的时候，能够毫无行动和俯首听命，那就是非常荒谬的了。”
