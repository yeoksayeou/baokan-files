Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to broadcasts from Thai radio, Nai Sarit, leader of the Thai "Revolutionary Committee," issued an order on the 17th prohibiting the import of Chinese goods. The order stated that the import of goods produced or manufactured in China, or goods transported from China, into Thailand is prohibited. Anyone who transports the aforementioned goods into Thailand will be in violation of customs laws.

The order said: Stores selling Chinese goods before the promulgation of this order should report the quantity of their inventory and the location of the inventory to the county office where the store is located, and must complete the report within fifteen days after the promulgation of the order. One month after the promulgation of this order, no one is allowed to sell Chinese goods.

The order explained that the reason for taking this measure suddenly was that Chinese goods were so-called "non-essential" and "difficult to investigate and control."

According to the "World Daily" in Bangkok on the 18th, the Bangkok market was greatly shaken after the above order was announced. Many stores are checking their inventory and preparing to report to the authorities.

The news said that merchants are currently concerned about how to deal with Chinese goods currently in customs and Chinese goods that are on their way to Thailand.

People in Beijing attach great importance to this news and are closely watching the development of the situation.

    泰国竟禁止输入和销售我国商品
    命令公布后曼谷市场极为震动
    新华社20日讯　据泰国电台广播，泰国“革命委员会”领导人乃沙立17日发布了禁止中国货物入口的命令。这项命令说，禁止在中国出产或制造的货物、或由中国运来的货物输入泰国，任何人如将上述货物运入泰国，就违犯海关法律。
    命令说：在这项命令公布之前售卖中国商品的商店，应当向这些商店所在地的县署呈报存货数量、存货存放地点，并且限在命令公布后十五天内办理呈报。从这项命令公布之日起一个月后，禁止任何人售卖中国商品。
    这项命令解释突然要采取这个措施的理由是所谓中国商品为“非必需品”和“难于调查管制”。
    据曼谷“世界日报”18日报道，上述命令公布后，曼谷市场极为震动。许多商店正在检查存货，准备向当局呈报。
    消息说，目前商人正关心目前存在海关的中国货以及正在运往泰国途中的中国商品应如何处理。
    北京人士对这一消息，颇为重视，并密切注视情况的发展。
