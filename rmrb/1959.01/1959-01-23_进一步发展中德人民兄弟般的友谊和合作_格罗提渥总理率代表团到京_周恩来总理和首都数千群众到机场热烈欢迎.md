Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The friendship envoys of the fraternal German people – the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl – arrived in Beijing by special plane this afternoon. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at Beijing Airport by Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders, as well as thousands of people from the capital.

The esteemed Prime Minister Grotewohl and his wife, along with other distinguished guests, visited our country for the first time in December 1955. Today, three years later, as the distinguished guests once again arrived in our capital, the thousands of people who had gathered at the airport to welcome them excitedly beat drums and gongs, waved countless colorful flags and bouquets, warmly celebrating the guests' return visit, celebrating the mutual support and close cooperation between the Chinese and German people in their common struggle, and celebrating the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The national flags of China and Germany fluttered in the wind at Beijing Airport. After the band played the national anthems of both countries, Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied Prime Minister Grotewohl in reviewing the honor guard. Young Pioneers of the capital presented flowers to all the distinguished guests.

Also present at Beijing Airport today to welcome the distinguished guests were Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, Chen Yi, and Bo Yibo; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong; Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng; Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei; as well as responsible persons from various departments of our state organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, first delivered a speech welcoming all the distinguished guests who had come from afar. Premier Zhou happily pointed out: "The visit to our country again by the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl will make a greater contribution to further developing the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two countries, to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the noble cause of defending world peace."

Thousands of people welcomed Prime Minister Grotewohl's speech with thunderous applause. In his speech, Prime Minister Grotewohl said: This meeting will help to further consolidate the friendship and brotherly cooperation between the peoples of our two countries.

Prime Minister Grotewohl emphasized: “The people of the German Democratic Republic are extremely pleased and concerned to note the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction and in the struggle against and crushing the conspiracies and provocations of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Taiwan area. The German Democratic Republic supports this just struggle of the Chinese people and firmly believes that the Chinese people will liberate Taiwan."

The speeches of the two Premiers (full text on page 2) were met with bursts of warm applause from thousands of welcomers.

After the speeches, Premier Zhou Enlai and others accompanied all the distinguished guests around the airport to meet the welcoming crowds. Amidst the thunderous applause and cheers that intertwined into one, many young women kept surging from the welcoming ranks towards Prime Minister Grotewohl and his wife, presenting bouquets of flowers to the distinguished guests. At this time, loud slogans such as "Long live the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German people!" and "Long live world peace!" rose and fell, lasting for a long time, and thousands of welcomers were immersed in an atmosphere of unlimited joy and friendship.

The delegation arrived in Beijing today from Hanoi by special plane via Wuhan. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan and our country's ambassador to the German Democratic Republic Wang Guoquan went to Wuhan to greet them and accompanied the distinguished guests to Beijing. When the distinguished guests passed through Wuhan, they were warmly welcomed at Wuhan Airport by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Meng Futang, Deputy Governor of Hubei Province, and others.
