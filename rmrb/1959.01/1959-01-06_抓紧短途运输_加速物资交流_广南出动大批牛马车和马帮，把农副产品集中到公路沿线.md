According to Yunnan Daily news: Guangnan County, Yunnan Province, in the procurement and transfer of agricultural and sideline products, has tightly grasped the link of relying on the masses to carry out short-distance transportation, promoted the sideline production of communes, expanded the procurement volume, and accelerated the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In nearly forty days, a total of 270 tons of agricultural and sideline specialty products were transferred out. Among them were more than 500 head of beef cattle (old and disabled), more than 1,800 head of fattened pigs, 18 tons of chicken and duck eggs, 21 tons of saltpeter, as well as a large amount of garlic, star anise, lily bulbs, and other agricultural and sideline products. More than 240 tons of production and living materials were also transported back.

After two concentrated procurement campaigns for agricultural and sideline products, Guangnan County purchased more than 600 tons of materials. However, at that time, the short-distance transfer could not keep up, and the trucks could not leave fully loaded. Because short-distance transportation was not carried out, urban industrial products could not be quickly transported to the countryside. On the other hand, the large amount of agricultural and sideline products that were collected increased the difficulties in storage work. After the county party committee discovered this problem, it immediately instructed the commercial departments to rely on the communes, mobilize the masses, and vigorously promote short-distance transportation.

The county has a large number of mares, but in the past, there was no habit of using mares for transportation, and the masses always felt that mares carried less. Later, the commercial department adopted the method of packing according to the strength of the livestock, with strong mules and horses carrying 150 jin, weak horses carrying only 100 jin, and mares carrying only 70 jin. This greatly exerted the potential of the horses. Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, the Nasa grassroots supply and marketing cooperative organized more than 100 people to drive 364 mules and horses, and quickly transported more than 50 tons of agricultural and sideline products to the transportation line, and at the same time transported more than 30 tons of industrial daily necessities back for the commercial department, which quickly increased the commune's transportation income by more than 2,000 yuan. Among the 19 communes in the county, except for the two communes that did not have surplus livestock, all organized transportation teams. A total of more than 1,200 horse-drawn carts, more than 80 ox carts, and more than 1,200 packhorses were organized. Because agricultural and sideline products were transferred to the highway, the commercial department received cash, and the procurement volume quickly increased from the original 1.1 million yuan to more than 1.9 million yuan. At the same time, with the return of transport capacity, a large number of industrial products also went to the countryside. Some fast-selling industrial products were no longer out of stock, and the phenomenon of trucks waiting for materials in the past has been changed into materials waiting for trucks.

In order to better carry out the transfer work, the county also organized different means of transportation according to different transportation conditions. Where the road is long and there is a horse-drawn cart road, the ox carts and horse-drawn carts are fully utilized; where there is no horse-drawn cart road, packhorses are used; on the mountain roads where packhorses travel and carry goods, such as transporting wood down from the mountain, oxen are used to drag it. In places where the road is relatively short, in order to better exert the enthusiasm of the commune, the method of reasonably adjusting regional price differences is also adopted, so that the commune is happy to mobilize the masses to send agricultural and sideline products to designated locations for sale. In order to avoid the loss of fresh agricultural and sideline products, the county also adopted the method of not mixing fattened pigs in the same pen, not mixing cattle and sheep in the same pen, and not mixing chickens and ducks in the same nest, and stored the purchased agricultural and sideline products in the commune or the homes of the masses, signed a good breeding contract, and transferred them to the designated locations in batches and in stages according to needs. In order to quickly transport the materials well transferred by short-distance transportation, the commercial department not only closely cooperated with the departments that transferred industrial products downwards and the departments that came to transport agricultural and sideline products, but also inquired in Guangxi, Gejiu, Kunming and other four places. As long as they heard that there were empty trucks passing through the county, they immediately contacted them, and on the premise of ensuring that the long-distance transportation of other places was not affected, they helped the county to carry out long-distance transportation, ensuring that the agricultural and sideline products of the county were continuously transported into the city.

    抓紧短途运输　加速物资交流
    广南出动大批牛马车和马帮，把农副产品集中到公路沿线
    据云南日报消息　云南省广南县在农副产品采购、调运中，紧紧抓住依靠群众开展短途运输这一环节，促进了公社的副业生产，扩大了采购量，加速了城乡物资交流。在近四十天中，共调运出农副土特产品二百七十吨。其中菜牛（老、残牛）五百多头、肥猪一千八百多头、鸡鸭蛋十八吨、火硝二十一吨，还有大量的大蒜、八角、百合片和其他农副产品。并运回生产生活资料二百四十多吨。
    广南县经过两个突击采购农副产品运动后，共收购起六百多吨物资。但当时因短途调运跟不上，汽车来了不能满载而去。由于短途运输没有搞起来，城市工业品也不能迅速运到农村去。另一方面，农副产品大量收起后，加大了储存工作中的困难。县委发现这一问题后，即指示商业部门依靠公社，发动群众，大搞短途运输。
    这个县有大量的骒马，但过去都没有用骒马运输的习惯，群众总嫌骒马驮得少。后来商业部门采取了根据牲口体质的强弱来打包，壮骡壮马驮一百五十斤，弱马只驮一百斤，骒马只驮七十斤。这样就大大发挥了马匹的潜力。那撒基层供销社在公社党委的统一领导下，组织了一百多人赶三百六十四匹骡马，很快就赶运了农副产品五十多吨集中到交通沿线，同时又为商业部门运回了三十多吨工业日用品，很快就为公社增加了两千多元的运输收入。全县十九个公社中，除没有多余畜力的两个公社外，都组织了运输队。总计共组织了马车一千二百多辆，牛车八十多辆，马帮一千二百多匹。由于农副产品调运到了公路沿线，商业部门得到了现款，采购量很快就由原先的一百一十多万元上升到一百九十多万元。同时，随着运力回转，大批的工业品也下了乡。一些脱销的工业品不脱销了，过去车等物资的现象也一变而成物资等车。
    为了更好的搞好调运工作，全县还根据不同的运输条件，组织了不同的运输工具。在路途较远有马车路的地方，就充分的运用牛马车；在没有马车路的地方，才运用马帮；在马帮行走和驮运的山路上，如从山上运木料下来，就用牛拖。在路途较近的地方，为了更好的发挥公社的积极性，还采取合理地调整地区差价的办法，使公社乐于发动群众把农副业产品送到指定的地点交售。为了避免鲜活农副产品的损失，全县还采取了肥猪不杂厩，牛羊不杂栏，鸡鸭不杂窝的办法，把采购好的农副产品寄存在公社或群众家里，订立好寄养合同，根据需要分期、分批的调运到指定的地点。为了使短途调运好的物资迅速运出，商业部门不但与下调工业品和来运农副产品的部门紧密配合，而且还到广西、箇旧、昆明等四处打听，只要听到有回空车路过本县，就立即联系，在保证不影响其他地方长途运输的前提下，帮助本县进行长途调运，保证了本县的农副产品源源不断的运入城市。
