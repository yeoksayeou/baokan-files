Currently, people all over the world are closely watching the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. The victorious Chinese people are infinitely excited about the victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista dictatorial regime, the agent of U.S. imperialism! We express great sympathy and concern for the fate of the Congolese people who are waging arduous struggles for their independence and freedom.

The Cuban people have waged a long struggle to end the brutal rule of Batista, U.S. imperialism's loyal dog, and to break free from the chains imposed on them by U.S. imperialism. The victory achieved by the heroic Cuban people under the leadership of Castro is not only a great victory for the Cuban people in their struggle for national independence and freedom, but also a major failure of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Latin America. The wicked U.S. imperialists are constantly launching vicious attacks and slanders against the Cuban interim government, which enjoys broad popular support, and are grossly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs. We cannot but express our great indignation at U.S. imperialism.

Under Belgian colonial rule, the Congo has long suffered extremely cruel oppression and exploitation. During the Second World War, U.S. imperialism also intervened in the Congo, which added another pair of shackles to the Congolese people. The heroic anti-colonial action of the Congolese people that broke out on January 14th shows that the Congolese people have awakened, indicating that there is no longer any "stable oasis" for imperialism on the African continent. We firmly support the just struggle of the Congolese people and oppose the imperialist crimes of military suppression, division, and deception against them.

The present era is an era of continuous growth of peaceful forces and a vigorous development of national independence movements. No matter how cunning and ferocious imperialism may be, it cannot stop the tide of this era. The Cuban people have won, and the Congolese people are bound to win.

We resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism!
We resolutely support the Cuban people and the Congolese people!
Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live the independence and freedom of the oppressed nations of the world!
Long live the eternal victory of the revolutionary and progressive people of the world!

    殖民者挡不住时代的洪流
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席张治中的讲话
    目前，全世界人民都在密切注视着古巴和刚果人民的正义斗争。胜利了的中国人民，对古巴人民推翻美帝国主义代理人巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的斗争的胜利，感到无限的兴奋！对正在为自己的独立自由进行着艰苦斗争的刚果人民的命运，寄予极大的同情和关怀。
    古巴人民为了结束美帝国主义忠实走狗巴蒂斯塔的残暴统治，挣脱美帝国主义强加在古巴人民头上的锁链，曾经进行了长期的斗争。英勇的古巴人民在卡斯特罗的领导下所取得的胜利，不仅是古巴人民争取民族独立和自由的一大胜利，同时也是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲侵略政策的一大失败。万恶的美帝国主义者，不断对得到人民广泛支持的古巴临时政府进行恶毒的攻击和诽谤，对古巴的内政进行粗暴的干涉。我们对美帝国主义不能不表示极大的愤慨。
    刚果在比利时的殖民统治下，长期以来受到的压迫和剥削是极其残酷的。在第二次世界大战中，美帝国主义又插足刚果，这就又在刚果人民的头上增添了一副枷锁。1月14日爆发的刚果人民反殖民主义的英勇行动，说明刚果人民已经觉醒了，表明在非洲大陆上对帝国主义已经没有什么“安定的绿洲”。我们坚决支持刚果人民的正义斗争，反对帝国主义对刚果人民的武力镇压和分化、欺骗的罪恶阴谋。
    现时代是和平力量不断壮大的时代，是民族独立运动蓬勃发展的时代。不管帝国主义怎样狡诈和凶恶，都不可能阻止这个时代的洪流。古巴人民胜利了，刚果人民也定要胜利的。
    我们坚决地反对帝国主义反对殖民主义！
    我们坚决地支持古巴人民、支持刚果人民！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界被压迫民族独立自由万岁！
    世界革命进步的人民永远胜利万岁！
