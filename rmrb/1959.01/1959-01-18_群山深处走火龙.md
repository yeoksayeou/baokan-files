    Walking Fire Dragon in the Deep Mountains
    By our reporter Xiao Ming

    On the last day of 1958, in the drizzling rain, the rail-laying project of the Qian-Gui Railway completed its final seven kilometers, reaching the starting station, Guiyang Railway Station. From then on, in this area known for its many mountains, trains roared; the distance between this remote area and the heart of the motherland, Beijing, as well as all parts of the country, was shortened. Now, traveling by train from Beijing takes about four days to reach Guiyang. From then on, Guizhou Province opened a new chapter in its construction history, and with the help of this iron line, the province's industrial construction will develop more rapidly.

    Although the Duyun-Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway (from Guiyang, Guizhou to Guilin, Guangxi) is only one hundred and forty-five kilometers long, this section of the project was exceptionally arduous.

    In 1956, the three thousand employees who built the world-famous Baoji-Chengdu Railway, without wiping their sweat or shaking off the dust, swung their arms south, shifting their battle lines to the Sichuan-Guizhou and Qian-Gui lines. Although the engineering tasks were closely linked, many people breathed a sigh of relief. Indeed! From the perspective of China's railway history, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be said to be a large melting pot for railway construction workers. After being tempered by this melting pot, what else is there to be timid about? However, not long after the project started, the railway construction workers became increasingly tense. They encountered new enemies that they had not only never encountered on the Baoji-Chengdu line, but were also rare in the history of railway construction in the entire country - sinkholes and underground rivers. And the troublesome problems encountered on the Baoji-Chengdu line - landslides, collapses, quicksand, faults and groundwater, etc. - were all present here. The Kuli Well spiral section was hailed as "Little Qinling." The earth and stone works on this section of the line were large and concentrated.

    The complexity of the terrain and geology of Guizhou Province brought great difficulties to railway construction. Whether you enter Guizhou from the south, north, east, or west, it's an endless succession of mountains and slopes. Mountains connect to mountains, and peaks connect to peaks, with jagged-toothed peaks of all sizes filling the entire provincial boundary. People say that Guizhou is "nowhere flat for three li." For the long-term perspective, this line adopted a relatively straight design plan. The highway from Duyun to Guiyang is more than one hundred and seventy kilometers long, while the railway is only one hundred and forty-five kilometers long. To build a relatively straight line between towering mountains, steep cliffs, and slopes, it is natural to cut mountains, fill gullies, dig tunnels, and build bridges. A total of thirty-two tunnels were excavated along the line, with a length equal to one-tenth of the line. Thirty-two large and medium-sized bridges and more than three hundred small bridges and culverts had to be built. In the Zhangjia Mountain area, there are four tunnels and three bridges in less than four kilometers of line, with tunnels and bridges accounting for 90% of the line. Cutting mountains and filling gullies means a huge amount of earth and stone work. The so-called earth and stone work, to put it simply, is the relocation of earth and stones. A total of 18,210,000 cubic meters of earth and stone had to be moved along the line, with an average of one hundred and ten cubic meters of earth and stone moved on each meter of the roadbed. From Xiaotiechong, through Datiechong, to Shangba, five steep mountain peaks were connected to form an earth dam four kilometers long.

    The Datiechong construction site here was once the key project of the entire line. With a total length of just over seven hundred meters, it involved 450,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work, requiring half a mountain to be cut away and two gullies to be filled, with the highest fill being twenty-six meters. Concentrated earth and stone projects like this had not been seen on the Baoji-Chengdu line. The workload was large, and the work surface was small, making it difficult to excavate and backfill. In order to break through this key project, the leaders of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, the director, the Party secretary, the chief engineer, and others, worked with the workers here for more than forty days. In the most intense two months of the project, eight hundred employees fought day and night in shifts. People saw the tall Tiechong Mountain being cut away by half and said happily: "We are eight hundred 'Foolish Old Men'!" The unanimous slogan of these eight hundred "Foolish Old Men" was to never let Tiechong become a stumbling block, and this slogan was realized. The Tiechong key project was completed ahead of schedule.

    It is relatively easy to imagine complex terrain; it is nothing more than many mountains, high mountains, many rivers, deep rivers, and rapid rivers.... Complex geology, on the other hand, is truly complex. The geology of Guizhou is not only complex but also constantly changing. When excavating the longest Dongshanping tunnel on the entire line, at 190 meters from the west entrance, rocks as hard as steel were encountered. One shot hole took twenty-six steel drills to penetrate only one and a half inches. Tungsten steel drill bits were used for about five hundred meters of the entire tunnel. In soft places, it was impossible to use pneumatic drills to drill holes and set off explosions; steel drills were often stuck in the loose soil. The tunnel also experienced a large amount of water inflow, with water depths of more than two feet, which the water pumps could not keep up with. In order to prevent collapses, an 87-meter-long open-cut tunnel was also built at the east entrance. Hu Baoqing, the chief engineer of the tunnel engineering team, said: "Tunneling is most afraid of encountering hardness, softness, water, and collapse, and we encountered them all here." The other thirty-odd tunnels also encountered these problems that troubled the workers. Some drilled into copper mines, some drilled into iron mines, some tunnels were "water curtain caves," and some tunnels felt like traveling by boat. Landslides were also common here. The more than 40,000 cubic meters of collapse at the Xiazhai tunnel was caused by the entire 3-4 meter thick surface layer sliding down along the rock fault, as if the entire mountain was moving.

    Of all the complex geological conditions, the most troubling for the railway workers were the sinkholes and underground rivers.

    The geological structure of Guizhou Province is mostly limestone, coupled with abundant groundwater, and the rocks have been weathered and dissolved over a long period of time, forming sinkholes and underground rivers all over the high mountains and deep valleys. These sinkholes and underground rivers vary in size; some are filled with loess, some have flowing water; some have rain and fog, and cold winds howl; some are like warm rooms in winter, the palaces of birds and beasts. All these strange sinkholes and underground rivers are difficult to detect on the surface, and their entrances and exits are not easy to find. Therefore, some geologists call sinkholes and underground rivers "mysterious enemies." The roadbed must avoid being built on sinkholes or underground rivers that have no load-bearing capacity, but sinkholes and underground rivers are all over the deep valleys and high mountains, and the line is long and straight, so you can't avoid them all. When encountering these hidden enemies at the beginning, the workers were a little flustered, but now they are experienced in subduing these enemies. The Shangzhai tunnel was built with a water absorption tunnel parallel to the tunnel, diverting the water from the sinkholes and underground rivers. Zhangjia Mountain Tunnel No. 1 encountered a sinkhole that could not be probed to the bottom, making it impossible to fill and grout. The technicians displayed their creativity and built a two-hole, sixteen-meter T-shaped bridge in this tunnel. A sinkhole was encountered under the arch wall of the same tunnel, and the workers built an arch bridge under this wall, using the arch bridge to support the arch wall.

    This line started large-scale construction in the spring of 1957, and after the autumn of the same year, with the daily rise of various construction undertakings across the country, the construction progress of the Duyun-Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway also accelerated day by day. Finally, following the leaping pace of various undertakings across the country, it was completed and opened to traffic half a year ahead of schedule. In the construction process, the Party committees at all levels of the railway construction department implemented political command, followed the mass line, and made tens of thousands of employees work with soaring enthusiasm, giving full play to their initiative and creativity. The complete set of successful experiences of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was applied and developed here. The flap car invented by the workers during the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was improved into a stepped chute flap car on the Tiechong construction site to adapt to the long soil transportation distance. Adapting to the characteristics of mountainous areas, blasting was widely used in construction. The rapid excavation method was used in tunnel engineering, repeatedly setting new national daily progress records. Employees across the line had nearly a hundred major inventions and tool reforms, some of which increased work efficiency by 1,400 times. In this new "melting pot," these tens of thousands of employees have learned many new skills. (Attached picture)

    The Duyun-Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway began handling temporary passenger transport on January 15. The Qian-Gui Railway is six hundred and five kilometers long. It is the first railway to the capital of Guizhou Province, Guiyang. Its starting point is Liuzhou City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is connected to the Xiang-Gui Line. The section of the line from Liuzhou to Jinchengjiang was built before liberation; the section from Jinchengjiang to Duyun is a restoration project, which was completed at the end of 1956; the section from Duyun to Guiyang is a new construction project, which is one hundred and forty-five kilometers long, passing through mountainous and hilly areas, with arduous projects. This is the scene of the Qian-Gui Railway Duyun-Guiyang section laying tracks to Guiyang Station on the last day of 1958. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Jialie.

    群山深处走火龙

    1958年的最后一天，在蒙蒙细雨中，黔桂铁路的铺轨工程完成了最后的七公里，到达起点站贵阳客站。从此，这以多山著称的地区，火车轰鸣了；这偏处一方的地区和祖国的心脏北京以及全国各地的距离缩短了。现在，从北京乘火车，约用四天就能到达贵阳。从此，贵州省在它的建设史上揭开了新的一页，借助于这条钢铁线路，全省工业建设将得到更迅速的发展。
    黔桂铁路（从贵州贵阳到广西的桂林）都筑段（从贵阳到都匀）长度虽然只有一百四十五公里，但是这段工程却异常艰巨。
    1956年，修筑举世闻名的宝成铁路的三万名职工，汗未擦、尘未挥，就挥臂南下，转战于川黔和黔桂两条线路上。虽然工程任务衔接得很紧，不少人还是舒了一口气。是啊！从中国的铁路史上看，宝成铁路可以说是筑路职工的一个大熔炉。经过这个熔炉锤炼的英雄们，还有什么值得心怯胆虚的呢？但是，工程开始不久，筑路职工们的心情就愈拉愈紧了。他们碰到了不仅宝成路上没有碰到过，就是全国铁路修建史上也罕见的新的敌人——溶洞和暗河。而宝成路上碰到过的那些伤脑筋的问题——塌方、滑坡、流沙、断层和地下水等等，这里又样样俱全。苦李井盘道被誉为“小秦岭”。这段线路的土石方工程又大而集中。
    贵州省地形地质的复杂，给铁路建设带来极大的困难。无论你从南从北，或从东从西入贵州境，都是上不完的山，下不完的坡。山连山峰接峰，狼牙锯齿般的大小峰峦，摆满了整个省界。人们都说贵州是
  “地无三里平”。为长远打算，这条线路采取了一条比较直的设计方案，都匀到贵阳的公路全长一百七十多公里，铁路却只有一百四十五公里。要在丛山峻岭悬岩陡坡之间修筑一条比较直的线路，自然就要削山、填沟、开洞、架桥。全线共开凿三十二个隧道，长度等于线路的十分之一。要修筑大中桥梁三十二座，小桥涵洞三百多座。张家山一带不足四公里线路就有四个隧道，三座桥梁，隧道和桥梁占线路的90％。要削山填沟，就意味着土石方工程的庞大。所谓土石方工程，说通俗点就是土和石头搬家。全线要挪动一千八百二十一万立方土石，平均每一公尺的路基上要挪动一百一十立方。从小铁冲，经大铁冲到上坝，五座陡立的山头连成了一条长达四公里长的土坝。
    这里的大铁冲工地，曾是全线的关键工程。全长不过七百多公尺，却有四十五万立方土石工程，要劈掉半边山填起两道沟，填得最高的土方有二十六公尺。像这样的集中的土石工程，宝成路上也没有见过。工程量大，工作面小，出土进土都困难。为了突破这个关键工程，贵阳铁路局的领导人、局长、党委书记、总工程师等人，在这里和工人共同劳动了四十多天。在工程最紧张的后两个月，这里有八百名职工日夜轮番战斗。人们看到高大的铁冲山被削去了半边，欣喜地说：“我们是八百‘愚公’！”这八百“愚公”的一致口号是绝不让铁冲当拦路虎，这口号实现了，铁冲重点工程提前完工了。
    说地形复杂，比较容易想像，无非是山多山高，水多水深水急……。说地质复杂，就真是复杂了。贵州的地质不仅复杂而且变化多端。开凿全线最长的东山坪隧道时，西口进到一百九十公尺处，碰到了如钢似铁的石头，有一个炮眼打了二十六根钢钎才打进去一公寸五。全洞约有五百公尺是用钨钢钻头打的。软的地方，又根本不能用风钻打洞放炮，钢钎常被松软的泥土卡住。洞里还曾经大量涌水，水深二尺多，抽水机都抽不及。为了防止坍方，东口还修了八十七公尺明洞。隧道工程队的总工程师胡宝庆说：“开隧道就怕遇到硬、软、水、坍，而这里都遇到了。”其他三十多个隧道，也无一不碰到这些使职工们伤脑筋的问题。有的钻到铜矿，有的钻到铁矿，有的洞内是“水帘洞”，有的洞内行车如行船。滑坡现象这里也不少。下寨隧道四万多方的坍方，就是三、四公尺厚的表层顺着岩石滑断面整个倾滑下来，好像整个山在搬家。
    所有复杂的地质情况中，最使铁路职工伤脑筋的是溶洞与暗河。
    贵州省的地质构造多石灰岩，加以地下水旺盛，岩石经过长期的风化溶解，形成了遍布高山深谷的溶洞与暗河。这些溶洞与暗河，有大有小；有的塞满黄土，有的流水淙淙；有的雨雾纷飞，冷风呼啸；有的如寒冬暖室，是飞禽走兽的宫殿。所有这些千奇百怪的溶洞与暗河，都是表面上难以发现的，进出口不易寻觅。因此，有些地质人员称溶洞、暗河为“神秘的敌人”。路基要避免修筑在没有承载力的溶洞或暗河上，但是溶洞、暗河遍布深谷高山，线路又长又直，躲了这个躲不了那个。开始碰到这些暗藏的敌人时，职工们有些手忙心慌，现在他们在治服这些敌人方面已经富有经验了。上寨隧道，修了个与隧道平行的吸水洞，把溶洞、暗河的水引出来。张家山一号隧道碰到了探不到底的溶洞，无法填灌，技术人员们发挥创造性，在这个隧道里修建了一个二孔十六公尺的丁字桥梁。在同一个隧道的拱墙下碰到了溶洞，工人们就在这个墙下修了一座拱桥，用拱桥驮着拱墙。
    这条线路在1957年春天全线展开大规模施工，到同年秋季以后，随着全国各项建设事业的逐日高涨，黔桂铁路都筑段施工进度也逐日加快。终于跟随着全国各项事业的跃进步伐，提前半年完工通车。在施工过程中，铁路施工部门各级党委实行政治挂帅，走群众路线，使数万职工干劲冲天，发挥了积极性、创造性。宝成路的全套成功经验都在这里运用了而且发展了。工人们修筑宝成路时发明的翻板车，在铁冲工地上适应运土距离长的特点，被改进成梯台滑槽翻板车。适应山区特点，施工中普遍采用了爆破。隧道工程采用了快速掘进法，屡创全国日进新纪录。全线职工有近百件较重大的创造发明和工具改革，有的提高工效一千四百倍。在这个新的“熔炉”里，这数万职工又学得了许多新本领。（附图片）
    黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳段已于1月15日开始办理临时客运。黔桂铁路全长六百零五公里。是通往贵州省省会贵阳的第一条铁路。它的起点是广西僮族自治区的柳州市，和湘桂线相连。这条线路中柳州到金城江一段是解放前修的；金城江到都匀一段是修复工程，已在1956年年底修通；都匀到贵阳一段是新建工程，长一百四十五公里，沿途经过山岳和丘陵地带，工程艰巨，这是黔桂铁路都贵段在1958年最后一天铺轨到贵阳车站的情形。　新华社记者　赵家烈摄
