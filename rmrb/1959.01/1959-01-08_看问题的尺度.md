The South Xing Production Brigade of the South Wang People's Commune conducted a lively discussion. The peasants used their personal experiences and simple language to broadly and deeply expound on the relationship between the collective and freedom. This discussion is another proof of the increased socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants.

There are various aspects and scales to looking at problems. What is freedom? There can also be different measures. Whether it is correct or not, the key issue lies in standpoint, viewpoint, and method.

Looking at it from a large perspective versus looking at it from a small perspective are two different scales. Looking at it from a large perspective, one can fully see the overwhelming power after collectivization, see how people gradually turn from slaves of nature to masters of nature, and feel boundless freedom.

Looking at it from a long-term perspective versus looking at it from the present are also two different scales. Looking further ahead, both recalling the impoverished lives of the vast peasantry during individual production and looking forward to the wonderful prospects of developing production and improving life after collectivization, will increase infinite confidence and strength, and cherish the free life immensely.

Looking at it comprehensively versus looking at it one-sidedly are also two different scales. Looking at the problem comprehensively: on the one hand, striving to safeguard collective interests, and on the other hand, rationally arranging personal freedom, can make everyone feel happy and invigorated, so that individuals can be at ease in collective life, harmonious and seamless.

The members of the South Xing Production Brigade saw the problem in this way. Their debate will inspire everyone. Please read this dispatch.

### 看问题的尺度

    看问题的尺度
    南王人民公社大南邢生产大队进行了一场生动活泼的讨论。农民们用切身的体验，朴实的语言，广泛而深刻地阐述了集体和自由的关系。这场讨论，是广大农民社会主义觉悟提高了的又一次证明。
    看问题，有各种侧面和尺度。什么是自由？也可以有不同的衡量。正确与否，关键问题在于立场、观点和方法。
    从大的方面去看和从小的方面去看，这是两种不同的尺度。从大的方面去看，就可以充分看到集体化后排山倒海的力量，看到人从自然的奴隶逐步转向自然的主人，就会感到无限的自由。
    从长远的方面去看和从眼前去看，又是两种不同的尺度。看得远一些，既回顾个体生产时广大农民捉襟见肘的穷困生涯，又瞻望集体化后发展生产改善生活的美妙远景，就会增加无限信心和力量，万分珍视自由的生活。
    从全面看和从片面看，也是两种不同的尺度。全面看问题：一方面努力维护集体利益，一方面合理安排个人自由，就可以使人人心境舒畅，精神奋发，使个人在集体生活中如鱼得水，融洽无间。
    大南邢生产大队的社员们就是这样看问题的。他们的辩论对每一个人都会有启示。请读者读读这篇通讯。
