Xinhua News Agency, 3rd January – The distinguished guests of the Albanian People's Republic government trade delegation, headed by Vice-Chairman Abdyl Këllezi, visited the Xuanwu Steel Plant in Beijing this morning with great interest.

The guests of honor were warmly welcomed by the factory director, Yang Chengwu, and the Party Branch Secretary, Zhang Zisen, upon their arrival at the steel plant. After listening to the introduction by Yang Chengwu and others, the guests braved the cold wind to visit the coke ovens, small blast furnaces, and the workers' labor. The Xuanwu Steel Plant was established in the great leap forward of July last year. The workers built the factory while learning, and immediately put it into production. Now there are eight small blast furnaces in the factory, which can produce more than 30,000 tons of iron annually. In addition, the factory also self-refines coke and has begun steelmaking. After learning about this situation, Vice-Chairman Abdyl Këllezi expressed his great admiration for the workers' enthusiasm and said that he would definitely introduce the workers' achievements and enthusiasm to the people of Albania. The cordial concern of the guests gave the steel plant workers great encouragement.

During the visit, Vice-Chairman Abdyl Këllezi also warmly introduced the Albanian people's socialist construction to the people of the factory. He also wished that the 1.5 million Albanian people and the 600 million Chinese people would always be closely united like brothers.

Prior to today, the Albanian guests had visited the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition and the Exhibition on Combining Education with Productive Labor, and had also toured the Forbidden City and Beihai Park.

    阿尔巴尼亚贵宾在京参观
    新华社3日讯　以阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府贸易代表团的贵宾们，今天上午以极大的兴趣参观访问了北京宣武钢铁厂。
    贵宾们到达钢铁厂的时候，受到了厂长杨成五和党总支书记张子森的热烈欢迎。贵宾们在听了杨成五等人的介绍后，便迎着寒风参观了炼焦炉、小高炉和工人们劳动的情形。宣武钢铁厂是在去年7月大跃进声中建立起来的。工人们一边建厂、一边学习，一边就投入了生产，现在厂内有八座小高炉，每年可炼铁三万多吨，此外厂内还自炼焦炭，并且已经开始炼钢。阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席了解到这些情况后，对工人们的干劲表示十分称赞，并表示一定要把工人们的成就和干劲介绍给阿尔巴尼亚的人民。贵宾们的亲切关怀给予钢铁厂的工人们很大的鼓舞。
    阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席在访问中还热情地向工厂的人们介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义的情况。他并且祝愿一百五十万阿尔巴尼亚人民和六亿多中国人民，像兄弟一样，永远紧紧团结在一起。
    阿尔巴尼亚的贵宾们在今天以前，曾先后参观了全国工业交通展览会和教育与生产劳动相结合展览会，还游览了故宫和北海公园。
