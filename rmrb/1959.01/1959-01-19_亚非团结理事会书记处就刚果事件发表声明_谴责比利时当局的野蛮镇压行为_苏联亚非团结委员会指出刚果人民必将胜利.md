Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 18th: The Secretariat of the Asian-African Solidarity Council issued a statement today, calling on the Asian-African Solidarity Committees and peace-loving forces of all countries to protest against the brutal acts of the Belgian authorities in suppressing the Congolese people.

The Secretariat demanded that an international committee be allowed to enter the Congo to thoroughly investigate the crimes of the Belgian authorities in brutally suppressing the Congolese people's resistance in Leopoldville.

The statement also demanded that the Belgian authorities immediately release the leaders of the "Abako" association and other detainees.

The Secretariat demanded recognition of Congo's freedom and the immediate withdrawal of Belgian troops from the Congo.

The Secretariat's statement said that the terrible massacre in Leopoldville—in which hundreds of unarmed people were slaughtered—exposed the hypocrisy of the Belgian claim that they are ideal imperialists and that the Congo is a peaceful and contented colony.

The statement pointed out that the fact is that Belgium—whose area is one seventy-seventh of the Congo's—exploits the rich Congolese land with unparalleled cruelty.

The statement refuted the Belgian lie that they
“developed” the Congo. It said that it is enough to mention that out of twelve million Congolese, there are only five hundred doctors. It also cited figures showing that the Belgian regime has caused the deaths of millions of Congolese.

The statement spoke of the so-called "reforms" that Belgium is planning to implement, saying that this is another trick intended to continue maintaining Belgian rule and prevent the Congolese people from gaining freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, January 18th: According to TASS, Moscow, January 17th: The Soviet Asian-African Countries Solidarity Committee issued a statement demanding that Belgian colonialists end their rampages in the Congo.

The statement said that the Soviet people angrily condemned the brutal suppression of the working people of Leopoldville and deeply sympathized with the just struggle of the Congolese people for freedom.

The statement said that all good people, all those who respect the freedom, happiness, and prosperity of all peoples, are supporting this heroic struggle of the Congolese people.

The statement pointed out that the events in the Congo clearly prove that people in every corner of the world are now fighting against the shackles of the evil colonial enslavement system.

The Soviet Asian-African Countries Solidarity Committee believes that the just cause of the oppressed Congolese people will inevitably be victorious, and the colonialists will be driven out of the Congo forever.

    亚非团结理事会书记处就刚果事件发表声明
    谴责比利时当局的野蛮镇压行为
    苏联亚非团结委员会指出刚果人民必将胜利
    新华社开罗18日电　亚非团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，号召各国的亚非团结委员会和爱好和平的力量抗议比利时当局镇压刚果人民的残暴行为。
    书记处要求，让一个国际委员会进入刚果去彻底地调查比利时当局在利奥波德维尔野蛮地镇压刚果人民反抗行动的罪行。
    声明并且要求比利时当局立即释放“阿巴科”协会的领袖和其他被捕者。
    书记处要求承认刚果的自由以及比利时军队立即撤出刚果。
    书记处的声明说，利奥波德维尔的可怖的屠杀——几百个非武装的人民遭到残杀——揭露了比利时人那种说法的虚伪性，他们说什么他们是理想的帝国主义，说什么刚果是一个平静的心满意足的殖民地。
    声明指出，事实是，比利时——它的面积等于刚果的七十七分之一——以无与伦比的残忍方式剥削着富饶的刚果土地。
    声明驳斥了比利时人所谓他们
  “开发”刚果的谎话。它说，只要提这一点就够了，在一千二百万刚果人中，医生只不过五百个。它还列举数字，说明比利时政权使成百万刚果人丧失了生命。
    声明谈到比利时正在计划实行的所谓“改革”说，这又是一个诡计，打算借此继续保持比利时的统治，不让刚果人民获得自由。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联亚非国家团结委员会发表声明，要求比利时殖民主义者结束在刚果的横行霸道。
    声明说，苏联人民愤怒地谴责对利奥波德维尔劳动人民的残酷镇压，并深深地同情刚果人民争取自由的正义斗争。
    声明说，所有善良的人、所有尊重各国人民自由、幸福和繁荣的人都在支持刚果人民这一英勇的斗争。
    声明指出，刚果所发生的事件十分清楚地证明，现在世界上每一个角落的人民都在开展斗争，反对万恶的殖民奴役制的束缚。
    苏联亚非国家团结委员会相信，被压迫的刚果人民的正义事业必然获得胜利，殖民主义者将永远被赶出刚果。
