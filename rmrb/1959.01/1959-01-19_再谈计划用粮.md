    More on Planned Grain Use
    Ruo Bo
    On January 6th, this newspaper reported that Shanzao People's Commune in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, was conducting extensive and in-depth education on diligence and thrift in running the commune, and establishing a system for saving money and planning grain use. It is very necessary for this commune to pay attention to the issue of conservation in a timely manner and to formulate measures. In particular, planning grain use and conserving grain is an important issue. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also discussed this issue at a meeting of county party secretaries held not long ago to study the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.
    Grain is the "treasure of treasures." With a bumper harvest of grain, it is possible to implement "eating without paying." This most important and reliable social insurance enables people to "no longer worry about eating" and to concentrate on "working harder" in production. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the hard work of 500 million peasants resulted in a bumper harvest of grain, with production more than doubling. With increased grain production, it is necessary to eat more appropriately to improve living standards. However, the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest of that year was only the first year of "three years of hard struggle"; even with the bumper grain harvest, conditions were uneven across different regions. Some had much larger harvests, some had smaller harvests; some had larger harvests of fine grains, some had larger harvests of potatoes and tubers; in some places and some communes, the "grain hurdle" and the "fine grain hurdle" have not been completely overcome. This requires striving for even greater harvests in this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward to change this imbalance. With a larger bumper harvest of grain, it is also necessary to "store grain against famine" and have grain reserves; it is also necessary to "comprehensively utilize" grain, develop commune industrial production, increase income, and better improve living standards. This requires, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest, planning grain use, conserving grain, and ensuring that necessary grain is reserved and that processing enterprises for comprehensive utilization are well-run.
    Conserving grain and planning grain use is especially important for running public canteens well. Communes grasp production on the one hand and living standards on the other. Running collective welfare undertakings and public canteens is a new undertaking, and there is a lack of experience. It is not surprising that some communes ate a little more grain for a while due to various reasons. As long as attention is paid, it is possible to implement planned grain use and achieve the goal of both conserving grain and improving living standards. It would be wrong to be "extravagant" and wasteful. The main criteria for running public canteens well are: eating enough, eating well, being both economical and hygienic. Public canteens in all regions should make careful calculations based on the situation of their own commune and the needs of the country, formulate a one-year living plan, and eat in a planned way. Food should be a combination of coarse and fine grains, with staple foods mixed with miscellaneous grains. More staple food can be eaten when doing heavy work, and less can be saved when doing light work and during leisure time. These are the principles that should be realized by public canteens in all regions.

    再谈计划用粮
    若波
    1月6日本报报道了湖南湘乡县山枣人民公社进行广泛深入的勤俭办社教育，建立节约用钱、计划用粮制度。这个公社能够及时注意节约问题，订出措施，是很必要的。尤其是计划用粮，节约粮食，是一个重要问题。中共贵州省委在不久前召开的县委书记学习八届六中全会决议的会议上，也曾讨论了这一问题。
    粮食，是“宝中之宝”。粮食丰收了，就能够实行“吃饭不要钱”。这一最重要最可靠的社会保险，使人们“不用再愁吃饭这一回事”，而能够专心“加劲干”生产了。1958年大跃进，五亿农民的辛勤劳动，获得了粮食增产一倍以上的大丰收。粮食增产了，适当地多吃一些，以改善生活，是必要的。但是，这一年的大跃进大丰收，只是“苦战三年”的第一年；就是粮食的丰收，各地也是不平衡的。有的丰收得多，有的丰收得少；有的细粮收得多，有的薯类收得多；有一些地方的一些公社，“粮食关”、“细粮关”还没有完全过去。这就要求在今年更大更好更全面的大跃进中，争取更大的丰收，来改变这种不平衡状况。粮食丰收得多了，还要求“积谷防饥”，有储备粮；还要“综合利用”，发展公社工业生产，增加收入，更好地改善生活。这就要求在大跃进大丰收的基础上，计划用粮，节约粮食，作到储备必要的粮食，办好综合利用的加工事业。
    节约粮食，计划用粮，重要的是办好公共食堂。公社一手抓生产，一手抓生活。办集体生活福利事业，办公共食堂，是一件新事业，缺乏经验。有的社由于种种原因，一时多吃了一些粮食，也是不足为怪的。只要引起注意，就能够实行计划用粮，达到既能节约粮食，又能改善生活的目的。如果“大手大脚”、铺张浪费，那就不对了。办好公共食堂的主要标准是：吃得饱、吃得好，既节约、又卫生。各地公共食堂都要根据本社的情况和国家的需要，精打细算，制定一年的生活规划，有计划地吃。食粮要粗细搭配，主杂掺合，干重活时可多吃点主粮，干轻活和休闲时可节约一些。这些原则是各地办好公共食堂所应当实现的。
