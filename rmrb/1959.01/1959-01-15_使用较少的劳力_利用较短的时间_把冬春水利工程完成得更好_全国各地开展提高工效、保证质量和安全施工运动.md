Xinhua News Agency, 14th: In order to create conditions for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, the national rural water conservancy winter repair movement has gradually unfolded. According to statistics, as of the 11th, the completed earth and stone work for winter water conservancy projects in provinces, cities, and regions across the country reached 5 billion cubic meters.

The characteristics of this year's water conservancy construction are more planned, more step-by-step, with emphasis on tool reform, improved efficiency, and more thorough preparation. Based on the experience of last year's winter water conservancy repairs and the needs of this year's greater leap forward in agriculture, all localities put forward winter repair plans early on and made necessary arrangements. Due to the widespread establishment of people's communes, while further implementing the policy of "small-scale as the mainstay, storage as the mainstay, and commune-run as the mainstay," all localities appropriately organized a small number of larger backbone projects, implementing a combination of large, medium, and small projects; while developing irrigation, attention was paid to the comprehensive utilization of hydropower, power generation, shipping, aquaculture, and other aspects. The easily flooded and drought-prone plains areas of Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Beijing provinces and cities absorbed the advanced experience of Anhui Province in water management in northern Anhui last year, and partially started river network projects. In Henan Province, there were forty-eight river network projects that started construction in October of last year. In Jiangsu Province, some major trunk rivers, such as the Grand Canal from Zhenjiang to Benniu Town, the Taipu Canal, and the Dongba water diversion trunk canal, have been successively started. A number of pilot river network projects in the Huaibei area of Anhui, such as the Zilu Lake in Suxian County, the Yandai Lake in Huaiyuan, and the Shanqiao Township in Linquan, have been completed one after another.

In addition to the larger river network projects, the large projects under construction in various places also include the Yin Tao project in Gansu, the Longjiang project in Guangxi, the Haihe River harnessing project in Hebei, the Zhanghe River project in Shanxi, and the old irrigation area reconstruction project in Xinjiang, and so on. The Northeast, Shandong, Hebei and other places also made full use of groundwater to dig wells. The hilly areas of the South emphasized the automation of irrigation, vigorously developing pond and reservoir groups and water diversion canals.

It is particularly worth mentioning that: the three northeastern provinces, determined to achieve a major turnaround in agriculture, have moved into the winter water conservancy movement after engaging in large-scale deep plowing, creating experience in rapid construction under the unfavorable conditions of the ground freezing three feet deep. In Heilongjiang Province, the winter temperature is as low as minus thirty or forty degrees Celsius, and people have always believed that wells cannot be drilled in winter. However, last winter, Zhao Zhou, Shuangcheng and other places created the warm room well drilling method, providing valuable experience for water conservancy construction in frozen soil areas. In terms of soil extraction, Shuangcheng, Wuchang and other counties used the characteristics of frozen soil being blocky, firm, and brittle to create impact-type soil splitters to replace iron picks and shovels. The thicker the frozen layer, the higher the efficiency, turning the unfavorable factors of winter construction into favorable factors. According to a survey in Qingling Township, Shuangcheng County, after using the soil splitter, the average efficiency per person per day exceeded twenty cubic meters, with the highest reaching fifty cubic meters, which is ten to twenty times higher than using an iron shovel to dig soil. Because everyone used their brains and came up with solutions, overcame numerous difficulties, and the province's water conservancy construction reached a daily progress of nearly three million cubic meters before the New Year.

This winter and spring water conservancy movement is being carried out in the context of a greater leap forward in various tasks in various places. All production fronts require considerable manpower, so the labor force invested in winter water conservancy repairs is less than last year. To this end, various localities have used the experience accumulated in water conservancy construction over the past year to further develop a high-efficiency movement of tool reform and construction method reform, emphasizing practical work, hard work, and clever work, improving construction efficiency and ensuring project quality. Some areas in Guangdong Province have focused on the five links of "digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting," which account for the largest workload in earthwork projects, and have carried out comprehensive reforms of tools and operating methods, increasing efficiency by several to dozens of times compared to the original. Xuwen County, which started technological innovation earlier, completed more than eleven times more earthwork projects by the end of November last year than in the same period of the previous year due to large-scale reform of tools; the recent average efficiency has increased more than ten times compared to the initial stage of construction. Large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites in various places have also run factories to produce equipment and materials, and run schools to train construction personnel, relying on the masses to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and technical strength, which has also created conditions for accelerating project progress, ensuring project quality, and safe construction.

At present, the national average efficiency of winter water conservancy repairs has increased by about 50% compared with the previous winter and spring, but the efficiency between different regions still varies greatly. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture recently held on-site observation meetings on water conservancy construction in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province and Changsha, Hunan Province, requiring all localities to promote advanced experiences, further carry out a movement of high efficiency, ensuring quality and safe construction, and strive to complete this year's water conservancy projects better with less labor and in a shorter time.

### 使用较少的劳力　利用较短的时间  把冬春水利工程完成得更好  全国各地开展提高工效、保证质量和安全施工运动

    使用较少的劳力　利用较短的时间
    把冬春水利工程完成得更好
    全国各地开展提高工效、保证质量和安全施工运动
    新华社14日讯　为今年农业生产更大的丰收创造条件，全国各地农村水利冬修运动已经逐步展开。据统计，截至11日止，全国各省、市、区水利冬修工程已完成的土石方达五十亿公方。
    今年水利建设的特点是更有计划，更有步骤，强调工具改革，提高工效，准备工作也较充分。各地根据上年度冬修水利的经验和今年农业更大跃进的需要，早就提出了冬修的规划，并且作了必要的安排。由于人民公社的普遍建立，各地在进一步贯彻“以小型为主、以蓄为主、以社办为主”的方针时，适当地举办了少量较大的骨干工程，实行大、中、小工程相结合；在发展灌溉的同时，注意对水力、发电、航运、水产等方面的综合利用。江苏、河南、山东、河北和北京等省、市的易涝易旱平原地区，吸收安徽省上年度淮北治水先进经验，部分地开始了河网化的工程。河南省在去年10月动工的河网化工程就有四十八处。江苏省一些主要的干河如镇江到奔牛镇的大运河、太浦运河、东坝引水干渠，都已相继开工。安徽淮北地区今年的一批河网化试点工程，如宿县紫芦湖、怀远烟袋湖、临泉单桥乡等地工程已先后完工。
    除较大的河网化工程外，各地正在施工的大工程，还有甘肃的引洮工程、广西的龙江工程、河北的根治海河工程、山西的漳河工程、新疆改建旧灌区工程，等等。东北、山东、河北等地还充分利用地下水大打机井。南方丘陵地区更强调灌溉自流化，大搞塘坝水库群和引水渠道。
    特别值得一提的是：决心实现农业大翻身的东北三省，继大搞深翻地之后已转入水利冬修运动，在地冻三尺的不利条件下，创造出快速施工的经验。黑龙江省冬季气温低到摄氏零下三、四十度，人们一向认为冬季是不能打机井的。但是去年冬天，肇州、双城等地创造了暖室打井法，给冻土地区兴修水利提供了宝贵的经验。在取土方面，双城、五常等县利用冻土成块而又坚脆的特点，创造了冲击式劈土器来代替铁镐、铁锨，冻层越厚效率越高，把冬季施工的不利因素变成了有利因素。据双城县青岭乡调查，使用劈土器后，每人每天平均工效超过二十公方，最高的达五十公方，比用铁锨刨土提高工效十倍到二十倍。由于大家动脑筋，想办法，克服了重重困难，全省水利建设在新年前就达到了近三百万公方的日进度。
    这个冬春的水利运动是在各地各项工作更大跃进的形势下展开的，各条生产战线都需要相当的人力，因此投入水利冬修的劳动力比上年度减少。为此，各地运用过去一年兴修水利所积累的经验，进一步开展了工具改革、施工方法改革的高工效运动，强调实干、苦干加巧干，提高了施工效率，保证工程质量。广东省有些地区抓住土方工程中工作量最大的“挖、装、运、卸、压”五个环节，对工具和操作方法进行了全面改革，工效比原来提高几倍至几十倍。开展技术革新较早的徐闻县，由于大规模改革了工具，去年11月底完成的土方工程比前年同期增加了十一倍多；最近的平均工效，又比开工初期提高了十多倍。各地大、中型水利工地还自办了工厂生产器材，自办学校培养施工人员，依靠群众克服器材和技术力量不足的困难，也为加速工程进度、保证工程质量和安全施工创造了条件。
    目前，全国水利冬修平均工效虽然比上年度冬春提高了50％左右，但是不同地区之间的工效，却还相差很大。为此，农业部最近在广东省湛江和湖南省长沙召开了南方十四省、区水利施工现场观摩会议，要求各地推广先进经验，进一步开展高工效、保证质量和安全施工的运动，力争用较少劳力，在较短时间内把今年的水利工程完成得更好。（附图片）
