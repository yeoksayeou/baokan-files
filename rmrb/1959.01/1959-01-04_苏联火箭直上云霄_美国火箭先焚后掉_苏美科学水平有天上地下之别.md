Xinhua News Agency, 3rd January: On January 2nd, the world's largest cosmic rocket soared from the Soviet Union and headed for the moon. By 5 PM Beijing time, the rocket had exceeded an altitude of 200,000 kilometers and was leaving the cradle of the Earth, flying towards the lunar palace. This is the first time in human history that the second cosmic velocity of over 11 kilometers per second has been reached, opening a new era for realizing mankind's dream of traveling to the moon and interplanetary flight for thousands of years.

As everyone knows, on October 4, 1957, Soviet scientists created the first great achievement in human history by overcoming the first cosmic velocity (8 kilometers per second). Since the world's first artificial satellite was launched into space, in just one year and three months, the Soviet Union has opened a brilliant and magnificent chapter in the history of mankind's conquest of the universe, successively launching two increasingly large satellites, repeatedly causing a sensation in the world. The Soviet Union's third satellite in May of last year reached an astonishing weight of 1,327 kilograms. And the weight of the last stage of the cosmic rocket launched this time reached 1,472 kilograms. Moreover, it increased the speed from 8 kilometers per second to exceed the second cosmic velocity. Therefore, it overcame the shackles of the Earth's gravity and flew into interstellar space. This is a magnificent achievement of Soviet science, a glorious victory of the socialist system, and another proof that the East wind further prevails over the West wind.

In the past few months, the United States, in order to make up for its failures in rocket technology, has been clamoring to launch a lunar satellite to save face. It tried four launches, but contrary to its wishes, each time ended in an embarrassing failure. On August 17, 1958, the United States launched its so-called first "lunar" rocket, but when it rose for only 77 seconds, it fell into the Atlantic Ocean, emitting white smoke. On October 11, the United States launched its second "lunar" rocket, named "Pioneer 1," but because it did not have the necessary speed and the fourth stage rocket failed, it only flew for about five hours before burning up over the South Pacific. On November 8, the US Air Force's third "lunar" rocket launch, conducted with "Pioneer 2," similarly failed, with the rocket only staying in the air for 45 minutes before burning up again. Following the three failures of the US Air Force, the US Army set a fourth embarrassing record with "Pioneer 3" on December 6. This failure was due to a malfunction in the fuel supply equipment.

These American "lunar" rockets could not resist the jokes played on them by Earth's gravity and were dragged back one by one. There was no question of going to the moon. Originally, to launch a satellite to orbit the Earth, it needs 8 kilometers per second (first cosmic velocity) to enter orbit, and 11.2 kilometers per second (second cosmic velocity) to enter interplanetary space. The United States' four test launches, some of which only reached a speed of 7.1 kilometers per second, did not even reach the first cosmic velocity. The fastest one reached 10.4 kilometers per second, flying to about 128,000 kilometers, but it could not escape the grasp of the Earth's gravity and was caught back. According to American news agencies, the four American "lunar" satellites were all launched by piecing together some medium-range rockets that could not even reach intercontinental range. No wonder Dr. Picklin, a rocket expert at the California Institute of Technology, said that the United States "hasn't learned to walk yet, but wants to run."

From the size of the rockets and satellites, it further illustrates the advanced nature of Soviet science. The last stage of the Soviet lunar rocket has reached 1,472 kilograms. The smallest of the American "lunar" satellites that could not be launched was only 5.9 kilograms, and the largest was only 38.5 kilograms. Even the "Atlas" satellite, which the United States has been bragging about the most recently, has an effective weight of only 67.5 kilograms. The last stage of the Soviet lunar rocket is almost 21 times larger than this Earth satellite. (Attached chart)

### 苏联火箭直上云霄　美国火箭先焚后掉  苏美科学水平有天上地下之别

    苏联火箭直上云霄　美国火箭先焚后掉
    苏美科学水平有天上地下之别
    新华社3日讯　1月2日，世界上最大的宇宙火箭从苏联临空而起，向月球飞去，到北京时间十七时，这个火箭已经超过二十万公里的高度，正在离开地球的摇篮，飞向月宫去了。这是人类历史上第一次达到并且超过每秒十一公里的第二宇宙速度，从而揭开了实现人类千百年来遨游月宫和星际飞行的梦想的新纪元。
    大家知道，1957年10月4日，苏联科学家创造了人类历史上第一次克服第一宇宙速度（每秒八公里）的丰功伟绩。自从世界上第一个人造卫星上天以来，不过一年零三个月的时间，苏联在人类征服宇宙的历史上又翻开了光辉瑰丽的篇章，接连发射了两个越来越大的卫星，一次又一次地轰动了世界。去年5月苏联的第三个卫星，已达一千三百二十七公斤的惊人重量。而这次发射的宇宙火箭最后一级的重量竟达到一千四百七十二公斤。而且把速度由每秒八公里提高到超过了第二宇宙速度。因而克服了地球引力的羁绊，向星际空间飞去了。这是苏联科学宏伟的成就，是社会主义制度的辉煌胜利，是东风进一步压倒西风的又一佐证。
    过去几个月，美国为了弥补火箭技术上的失败，曾经大叫大嚷要发射月球卫星，挽回一些面子。它试射了四次，可是，事与愿违，每次都以丢丑的失败告终。1958年8月17日美国发射了它的所谓第一个“月球”火箭，可是当它上升了只有七十七秒钟的时候，就冒着白烟坠入了大西洋。10月11日，美国又第二次发射了“月球”火箭，名叫“先驱者一号”，但因为它不具备必要的速度和第四级火箭的失灵，只飞行了五小时左右，就在南太平洋上空焚毁。11月8日，美国空军以“先驱者二号”所进行的第三次“月球”火箭的发射工作，同样地遭到了失败，火箭仅在空中停留了四十五分钟就又烧毁了。继美国空军的三次失败之后，美国陆军在12月6日又以“先驱者三号”创下了第四次丢丑的纪录，这次失败是由于燃料供应设备出了毛病。
    这些美国“月球”火箭都挡不住地球引力给它们开的玩笑，一个个地被拖回来了。根本谈不上什么去月球。原来，要发射卫星环绕地球旋转，须要每秒八公里（第一宇宙速度）才能进入轨道，进入行星际空间须要十一点二公里（第二宇宙速度）。美国四次试射，有的速度只达到每秒七点一公里，连第一宇宙速度都没有达到。最快一次达到每秒十点四公里，飞到了十二万八千公里左右，也逃不出地球引力的手心，被它抓回来了。据美国通讯社报道，美国四个“月球”卫星都是用一些连洲际射程都到不了的中程火箭拼凑起来发射的。无怪乎，美国加利福尼亚理工学院火箭专家皮克临博士说，美国是“还没有学会走路，就想跑步”。
    从火箭和卫星的大小看，更说明了苏联科学的先进。苏联月球火箭最后一级已经达到一千四百七十二公斤重。而美国射不上去的“月球”卫星最小的只有五点九公斤，最大的只三十八点五公斤。就是美国最近吹嘘得最厉害的“阿特拉斯”卫星的有效重量也只有六十七点五公斤。苏联的月球火箭最后一级几乎比这个地球卫星大二十一倍。（附图表）
