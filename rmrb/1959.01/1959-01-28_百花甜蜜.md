Title: The Sweetness of a Hundred Flowers

　　Recently, I often hear people talking about bees. One farmer recited a poem: "Don't be like spiders spinning their own webs, learn from bees collecting flowers together." A literary magazine is even named "Bee." I also saw in the newspaper that someone mentioned the words of the 17th-century British scholar Bacon, who divided the attitudes of scholars into three categories: ants, spiders, and bees. Those who can connect with reality and integrate knowledge belong to the bee category. It seems that from ancient times to the present, people have always admired the bees' group nature and their ability to collect and create.

　　The bee's amazing spirit of contributing everything and sacrificing everything for the collective (even though it is instinctual and not based on any thought) is truly admirable. Everyone who has observed a hive or been stung by a bee knows that bees work diligently for the collective, so earnestly and persistently. When they encounter an enemy, they will bravely attack, not caring that they will die after losing their stinger. Not only that, even if the person who disturbed the hive avoids being stung, other bees, smelling the scent of the sting on their skin, will continue to pursue them, seeking revenge for their companions. This is truly admirable.

　　Leaving these things aside, just from the bee's honey collection, there are many working methods that can be learned. Why is honey so sweet? Sweet enough to last for thousands of years without spoiling, sweet enough that bacteria cannot grow on it? It turns out that bees concentrate and refine the sweetest and most quintessential things from all flowers, which makes honey, although derived from flowers, far sweeter and surpasses all flowers.

　　If people were like bees, extracting all the "best of the best" things and integrating them together, what would they create?

　　The answer is: they would definitely create extremely wonderful things.

　　Painters who travel through famous mountains and rivers paint the most magnificent landscapes; chefs who pick the heart of vegetables create the most delicious dishes.

　　In the same way, if we carefully observe, all good working methods have a principle similar to that of bees brewing "the sweetness of a hundred flowers."

　　Gathering the wisdom of the masses can make one the wisest person. The "Eight-Character Charter" in agriculture was formulated by the Party by summarizing the experience of high yields from farmers across the country. Although these experiences originally came from farmers in various places, the "Eight-Character Charter" is higher than all the scattered experiences of farmers. It can be said that the appearance of ten-thousand-jin mu yields is the result of using the "Eight-Character Charter" more extensively.

　　This working method has recently produced miracles in pig farming as well. In recent years, many good methods for raising fat pigs have been created in various places. Like removing the thyroid gland to make pigs "fatten foolishly," like cutting off part of the pig's tail and ears to stimulate the pig's metabolism, injecting spleen tissue fluid, and adopting the "starving water method," etc. Recently, students from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department of South China Agricultural College concentrated these advanced methods and experimented on several pigs. One of the fat pigs, which underwent the most comprehensive of these experiments, gained twenty-three jin in a single day, creating an amazing record.

　　Many production experts in factories are actually adopting this method of brewing "the sweetness of a hundred flowers" to improve their skills. One advanced female worker described her experience like this: "I just watched from the side how those who do well operate, remember their advantages, and concentrate them." The words are simple, but isn't that how miracles are created?

　　If we think more broadly, if we can absorb the strengths of others everywhere in learning and work, and have the ability to integrate and understand them, we will definitely be able to brew the sweetness of a hundred flowers. The Party's mass line also includes some of these things. Ancient maxims such as "Mount Tai does not reject soil, rivers and seas do not choose small streams" actually reflect people's simple understanding of this principle at that time.

　　However, why do many people fail to apply or even understand this principle, which seems not difficult to understand and not difficult to learn, in their actual lives? After careful study, we can know that although the principle is simple, arrogant people, complacent people, people who are afraid of difficulties, people who stop after a taste, people who lack respect and affection for others, and people who are unwilling to practice seriously or are unwilling to diligently grasp theory, are all impossible to truly brew the sweetness of a hundred flowers.

　　We must get rid of all those shortcomings before we can talk about thoroughly following the mass line and brewing the sweetness of a hundred flowers.

    百花甜蜜
    秦牧
    近来常常听到有人在谈蜜蜂。有一位农民吟诗道：“莫学蜘蛛各牵网，要学蜜蜂共采花”。有本文学杂志名字就叫做“蜜蜂”。在报上又看到有人提到英国十七世纪学者培根的话，他把搞学问的人治学的态度分为蚂蚁、蜘蛛、蜜蜂三类，能够联系实际，又能够融会贯通的就属于蜜蜂这一类。看来从古到今，人们对于蜜蜂的群性、采集创造的本领一直是十分赞赏的。
    蜜蜂那惊人的为集体贡献一切，牺牲一切的精神（尽管那是出于本能，并不是有什么思想），着实是使人赞美的。每一个观察过蜂巢、或者给蜜蜂叮过的人都知道，蜜蜂勤勤恳恳为集体工作着，是那样的认真，是那样的始终不懈。当一旦碰到敌人的时候，它们会奋勇袭击，尽管失去了刺之后就会死亡，也丝毫在所不顾。不止这样，即使捣乱蜂巢的人在被螫后避开了，其他的蜜蜂闻到他皮肤上被螫过地方的那股味道，还会继续追击，为同伴复仇，这真是十分使人赞叹的。
    撇开这些不谈，单从蜜蜂采蜜这回事来看，这里面就大有工作方法可以学习。蜜糖为什么这样甜？甜到可以经千百年不坏，甜到细菌无法在上面繁殖？原来，蜜蜂把所有花朵的最甜蜜最精粹的东西都集中提炼起来了，这就使得蜜糖虽出自花朵，然而却远远地甜美得盖过所有的花朵了。
    假如人也像蜜蜂那样，摘取一切“顶儿尖儿”的东西，使它融会在一起，那会创造出什么东西来呢？
    答案是：一定将创造出极其美妙的事物。
    遍历名山大川的画家，画出了最雄奇的山水；摘菜心来炒菜的厨子，炒出了最美好的肴馔。
    和这些道理一样，我们认真地观察一下：一切良好的工作方法，那道理都和蜜蜂酿制“百花甜蜜”的道理差不多。
    把群众的智慧集中起来，就可以成为最有智慧的人。农业上的“八字宪法”，是党概括了全国农民的丰产经验制订出来的。这些经验虽然原来出自各地的农民，然而“八字宪法”却高于所有农民的一切零星经验。所有万斤亩的出现，可以说都是比较多地运用了“八字宪法”的结果。
    这种工作方法，最近在养猪方面也出现了奇迹。近年来各地创造了许多养肥猪的好方法。像割除甲状腺，使猪“痴肥”起来啦，像割去一部分猪尾巴和猪耳朵以刺激猪的新陈代谢作用啦，注射脾组织液啦，采取“饿水法”啦等等。最近华南农学院畜牧兽医系的学生把这些先进方法集中实验到几头猪身上，其中有一头最全面地施行了这些试验的肥猪，竟一天增重二十三斤，创造了令人惊异的纪录。
    工厂里不少生产能手，他们实际上也是采取这种酿“百花甜蜜”的方法来提高自己的本领的。有一位先进女工这样叙述她的经验道：“我不过是在一旁看那些干得好的人怎样操作，记住她们的优点，把它集中起来罢了”。话是简简单单的几句，然而奇迹不就是这样创造出来的么？
    我们要是更广泛地想一想，在学习上，在工作上如果能处处吸取别人的长处，自己又有一种加以融会贯通的本领，是一定可以酿成百花甜蜜的。党的群众路线的道理也包括了这么一些东西。古代的“泰山不辞土壤，河海不择细流”等格言，实际上也多少反映了当时人们对这种道理的朴素的认识。
    然而这种粗看起来并不难懂不难学的道理，为什么有不少人在实际生活中却不能够运用甚至一窍不通呢？仔细研究一下，就可以知道：道理虽然简单，然而骄傲的人，自满的人，怕困难的人，浅尝即止的人，对旁人缺乏尊重缺乏感情的人，不肯认真实践或者不肯辛勤掌握理论的人，都是不可能真正酿出百花甜蜜来的。
    必须去掉那一切毛病，然后才谈得上彻底走群众路线，才谈得上酿百花甜蜜。
