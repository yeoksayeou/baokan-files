Major Step Towards Peaceful Resolution of the German Question

On January 10, the Soviet government proposed a draft peace treaty with Germany and sent notes to the governments of the countries involved in the war against Germany, suggesting that a peace conference be held within two months with the participation of representatives from both German states to discuss and sign the peace treaty. In its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, the Soviet government also expressed its willingness to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations. The Soviet government's proposal was endorsed by the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, which urged the West German authorities to negotiate on the draft treaty. The Soviet government's proposal is of great significance for the peaceful resolution of the German question, the promotion of German reunification, and the easing of tensions in Europe. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's proposal, which is beneficial to German unity and to peace in Europe and the world.

It has been nearly fourteen years since the end of the war against Germany, and the Allied countries that participated in the war against Germany during World War II and other countries that had been on the side of Germany have also signed peace treaties for several years. However, no peace treaty has been signed with Germany alone. While other countries allied with Hitler have gained freedom and independence as a result of signing peace treaties, Germany is still unable to exercise its national sovereignty. Foreign troops continue to be stationed on German territory. Western countries still maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin. All this is clearly abnormal.

In order to eliminate this artificially abnormal situation, the Soviet government has made long-term and unremitting efforts. As early as July 1946, the first year after the end of the war, the Soviet government proposed discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany at the Paris Conference of Foreign Ministers. However, at that time, the Western countries delayed the establishment of a German central administrative body, and at the same time used the pretext that this central body had not yet been established to refuse to discuss the peace treaty with Germany. Afterwards, Western countries, especially the United States, stepped up their conspiracy to split Germany. They first split Germany economically, implemented a separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones, and then merged the three Western occupation zones. By 1949, this split activity reached its peak, and they unilaterally established the government of the Federal Republic of Germany headed by Adenauer. In order to protect the interests of the German people from being harmed by the Western splitting activities, the outstanding representatives of the German people, with the support and assistance of the Soviet government, established the first worker-peasant state in German history—the German Democratic Republic. Since then, two German states have emerged on German territory.

The facts of the past few years have proved that these two German states are developing along two different paths. The German Democratic Republic, together with the Soviet government, faithfully followed the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and thoroughly eradicated the root cause of the threat to the world's people—German militarism, fascism, and Nazism. The territory of eastern Germany, originally a part of the hotbed of German militarist war, has become a peace-loving and democratic country. But in West Germany, the Potsdam Agreement has been torn to shreds by Western countries, and the forces of German militarism have revived rampantly with the support and assistance of Western countries. Soon this militaristic West Germany, full of revenge frenzy, was dragged into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc by Western countries. This made West Germany, together with West Berlin under Western occupation, a "cold war" base for this aggressive bloc to oppose and subvert socialist countries. This situation has created an ever-widening rift between the two German states, creating a sharply opposed situation in Central Europe, thus placing the peace and security of Europe under serious threat. At the same time, the US decision to arm the West German army with atomic weapons has made this dangerous situation even more explosive.

In order to adapt to the above-mentioned changed situation on German territory since the post-war period, to eliminate the abnormal situation of German division, and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question, the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested discussing and signing a peace treaty with Germany for a long time, and at the same time has put forward various constructive suggestions and measures to eliminate tension and promote the rapprochement of the two German states. For example: declaring the end of the state of war with Germany, canceling the military occupation of the German Democratic Republic; restoring normal diplomatic relations with West Germany; withdrawing foreign troops in East and West Germany and Europe; establishing a Central European zone free of atomic weapons; the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty signatories signing a treaty of non-aggression; supporting the German Democratic Republic's proposal to establish a confederation of the two German states.... All these proposals are conducive to creating good conditions for the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful resolution of the German question. But all these efforts have been unreasonably rejected one by one by Western countries. Since the end of the war, Western countries have never put forward a reasonable solution to the German question. The only thing they have put forward is: to establish an "all-German government" by means of so-called "free elections" in West Germany to annex the German Democratic Republic and then sign a peace treaty with this "all-German government." This is of course not to solve the German problem, but to obstruct the solution of the German problem.

For a long time, the struggle between the two roads on the issue of the German peace treaty and the German question has shown that the Soviet government has always proceeded from the interests of safeguarding European and world peace, and has unremittingly tried every means to turn militarist Germany, which has brought great disasters to the world twice in the past, into a peaceful and democratic country, so that the people of Europe and the world will never again suffer the pain of aggression by German militarism. But Western countries, especially the United States, are trying their best to occupy the territory of West Germany and use it as a tool for launching new aggressive wars in Europe. This policy of the Western countries has made the tense situation caused by the division of Germany worse and worse.

Last November, the Soviet government took another initiative in resolving the German issue, proposing the termination of the foreign occupation regime in Berlin and the establishment of a demilitarized free city of West Berlin. The implementation of the Soviet government's proposal can first make West Berlin no longer a poisonous tumor that endangers world peace, so as to ease the current tense situation in the Berlin area. Reaching an agreement on the Berlin issue can help eliminate the deep hatred and suspicion between Eastern and Western countries and East and West Germany, restore trust and rapprochement between them, and thus more easily promote the countries concerned to reach an understanding on the issue of signing a peace treaty with Germany. All this can only be beneficial to European peace and the settlement of the German unification issue.

However, the Soviet government's initiative was stubbornly rejected by Western countries. They also stirred up an atmosphere of "cold war" around the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue. In their recent replies to the Soviet government, Western countries once again expressed their unwillingness to abandon their occupation regime in West Berlin, but at the same time, in order to deceive world public opinion, Western countries hypocritically proposed to discuss the Berlin issue with the Soviet government in a broader scope of discussing the German issue and European security issues. But people know that the key to ensuring European security is to reunify the currently divided Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Under the current specific conditions of the existence of two different German states, the issue of restoring German unification has become an internal German issue, and this issue can only be resolved through the rapprochement and consultation of the two German states. Any attempt to overstep one's authority by the Four Powers can only constitute interference in Germany's internal affairs and can never be accepted by both parts of Germany. And what the Four Powers can do in restoring German unification is to convene a peace conference with the participation of the countries concerned as soon as possible to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany, so as to prepare conditions for promoting the realization of German unification. It is for this reason that the Soviet government has once again put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany and suggested that a peace conference be held within two months to discuss and sign the treaty. The draft peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government stipulates the restoration of the German people's full sovereignty over Germany, German territory, and German airspace; that no restrictions be imposed on Germany in the development of its own peaceful economy, trade, shipping, and access to the world market; and that Germany be recognized as having the right to possess its own armed forces necessary for national defense. The draft treaty also stipulates certain military restrictions, such as prohibiting the production of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, and prohibiting the use of these weapons to equip the German army. Obviously, the Soviet proposal will not harm the prestige and security of any country. It will only help eliminate the threat of the resurgence of German militarism, ensure that the German people engage in peaceful and creative labor, and greatly help consolidate international peace and security. At the same time, the Soviet government also expressed its willingness to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations in its notes to the United States, Britain, and France. There is no doubt that if the countries concerned can discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany on the one hand, and at the same time resolve the Berlin issue, this can promote each other on the German issue. The Soviet action once again showed its consistent sincerity in striving for a peaceful resolution of the German question and promoting German unification.

Do Western countries and the Adenauer government not often express their willingness to reunify Germany? Do their replies not also say that they want to negotiate to resolve the issues of European security and German unification? Now the Soviet government's proposal has once again provided a good basis, and the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has also expressed its willingness to negotiate with West Germany on the draft treaty, so what reason do the governments of the United States, Britain, and France and the Adenauer government have not to show their sincerity?

    促进和平解决德国问题的重大步骤
    1月10日，苏联政府提出了对德和约草案，并且向参加对德战争的有关国家的政府发出照会，建议在两个月内召开有两个德国的代表参加的和会来讨论和签订对德和约。苏联政府在给美英法政府的照会中还表示愿意通过谈判解决柏林问题。苏联政府的建议得到了德意志民主共和国部长会议的赞同，部长会议并敦促西德当局就和约草案进行谈判。苏联政府的这一建议对于和平解决德国问题和促进德国重新统一的实现，以至缓和欧洲的紧张局势都有着重大的意义。中国人民衷心支持苏联政府这一有利于德国统一、有利于欧洲和世界和平的建议。
    对德战争结束以来已近十四年了，第二次大战时参加对德战争的盟国和曾经站在德国方面的其他国家签订和约也已经好几年了。但是唯独对德国还没有签订一项和约。当其他和希特勒结盟的国家，由于签订和约获得了自由和独立的时候，而德国却仍然失去行使自己的国家的主权的可能。外国军队仍然继续驻扎在德国的领土上。西方国家至今保存着对西柏林的占领制度。这一切显然是极不正常的。
    为了消除这种人为的不正常的局面，苏联政府曾经进行了长期的坚持不懈的努力。早在战争结束后的第一年1946年7月，苏联政府在当时四国外长巴黎会议上就提出讨论对德和约的问题，但是当时西方国家一面拖延建立一个德国中央行政机关，同时又以这个中央机关尚未成立为借口拒绝讨论对德和约。之后，西方国家特别是美国，加紧策划分裂德国的阴谋。它们首先从经济上分裂德国，在西方占领区内实现了单独的货币改革，接着又合并了西方三个占领区，到1949年这种分裂活动更达到了最高点，它们片面地建立了以阿登纳为首的德意志联邦共和国政府。为了保护德国人民的利益不因西方的分裂活动而受害，德国人民的优秀的代表在苏联政府的支持和帮助下，成立了德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国。从此德国的领土上就出现了两个德国。
    几年来的事实证明，这两个德国正在依据两条不同的道路发展着。德意志民主共和国和苏联政府一起，忠实地遵循着波茨坦协定的规定，彻底铲除了威胁世界人民的祸根——德国军国主义、法西斯主义和纳粹主义。德国东部的领土由一个原来德国军国主义战争温床的一部分，变为一个爱好和平和民主的国家。但是在西德，波茨坦协定已经被西方国家撕得粉碎，德国的军国主义势力重又在西方国家的扶植和帮助之下，猖狂地复活起来了。不久这个充满复仇狂的军国主义的西德又被西方国家拉入了北大西洋侵略集团。这样就使西德连同处于西方占领之下的西柏林成为了这个侵略集团的反对和颠复社会主义国家的“冷战”基地。这种情况造成了两个德国之间越来越深的裂痕，造成了在欧洲中部尖锐对立的形势，从而使欧洲的和平和安全处于严重的威胁之下。同时由于美国决定用原子武器来武装西德军队，就更使这种危险的局面增加了爆炸性。
    为了适应战后以来德国领土上的上述变化了的形势，以消除德国分裂的不正常局面，并争取和平解决德国问题，苏联政府长期以来一再建议讨论和签订对德和约，同时又提出了各种各样的消除紧张局势和促进两个德国接近的建设性的建议和措施。例如：宣布结束对德作战状态，取消对民主德国的军事占领；恢复和西德的正常外交关系；撤退在东西德和欧洲的外国军队；建立中欧无原子武器区；北大西洋集团和华沙条约缔约国签订互不侵犯条约；支持民主德国提出的两个德国建立邦联的建议……。所有这一切建议都有助于为签订对德和约和和平解决德国问题创造良好的条件。但是这一切的努力都给西方国家一个一个无理拒绝了。从战后以来，西方国家自己从来没有提出过一个合理的解决德国问题的方案。它们唯一的提出来的东西就是：以西德吞并民主德国的所谓“自由选举”来建立一个“全德政府”然后和这个“全德政府”签订一项和约。这当然不是为了解决德国问题，而是为了阻挠德国问题的解决。
    长期以来，在对德和约和德国问题上两条道路的斗争表明：苏联政府始终从保障欧洲和世界和平的利益出发，坚持不懈地想尽一切办法来把过去两次给世界带来巨大灾难的军国主义的德国变成一个和平、民主的国家，使欧洲和世界人民永远不再遭受德国军国主义的侵略的痛苦。但是西方国家特别是美国却竭力要霸占西德的领土，把它当作在欧洲发动新的侵略战争的工具。西方国家的这种政策，使得由于德国的分裂局面所造成的紧张局势越来越恶化。
    去年11月苏联政府又在解决德国问题上采取了主动措施，提出终止外国对柏林的占领制度、建立西柏林非军事化自由城市的建议。实现苏联政府的这个建议，首先可以使西柏林不再成为一个为害世界和平的毒瘤，以缓和目前在柏林地区的紧张局势。而在柏林问题上取得协议就能帮助消除目前在东西方国家和东、西德之间的深刻的仇视和猜疑，恢复它们之间的信任和接近，因而也就更容易地促使有关国家在签订对德和约问题上达成谅解。这一切只能对欧洲的和平和解决德国统一问题有利。
    但是，苏联政府的这一创议又给西方国家顽固地拒绝了。它们并且还围绕着苏联关于柏林问题的建议煽起一阵“冷战”的气氛。在最近西方国家给苏联政府的复照中，它们再一次表示不愿放弃它们对西柏林的占领制度，但同时为了欺骗世界的舆论，西方国家假惺惺地提出要跟苏联政府在讨论解决德国问题和欧洲安全问题的更广泛的范围内讨论柏林问题。但是人们知道，保障欧洲安全的关键问题是要把目前分裂的德国在和平和民主的基础上重新统一起来。而在目前存在两个不同德国的具体条件下，恢复德国统一的问题已经成了德国内部的问题，这个问题只有通过两个德国的接近和协商的途径才能得到解决。任何想由四大国越俎代庖的办法都只能造成对德国内政的干涉，决不能为德国的两部分所共同接受。而四大国在恢复德国统一问题上所能尽力的就是尽快地召开有关各国参加的和会来讨论和签订对德和约，以为促进德国统一的实现准备条件。正是为了这个缘故，苏联政府再一次提出了对德和约草案，并建议在两个月内举行和会来讨论和签订和约。苏联政府提出的和约草案规定恢复德国人民对德国、德国领土和领空的完全主权；在发展本国和平经济、贸易、航运和进入世界市场等方面不对德国施加任何限制；承认德国有权拥有国防所必需的本国武装部队。条约草案还规定了某些军事上的限制，例如禁止生产核子武器和火箭武器，并且禁止用这些武器装备德国军队。显然，苏联的建议不会损害任何国家的威信和安全。它只会有助于消除德国军国主义再起的威胁，保证德国人民从事和平创造性劳动，并大大有助于巩固国际和平和安全。同时苏联政府在给美英法的照会中又表示愿意通过谈判来解决柏林问题。毫无疑问，如果有关国家能够一方面讨论和签订对德和约，另一方面又能同时解决柏林问题，这就能在德国问题上相互推动。苏联的这个行动再一次表明了，它一贯努力和平解决德国问题和促进德国统一的诚意。
    西方国家和阿登纳政府不是经常表示它们愿意使德国重新统一吗？它们的复照不是也说要谈判解决欧洲安全和德国统一问题吗？现在苏联政府的这一建议已经又一次提供了良好的基础，德意志民主共和国部长会议也表示愿意就和约草案跟西德进行谈判，那末美、英、法政府和阿登纳政府还有什么理由不拿出自己的诚意来呢。
