    The Beauty of Helping Others
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao
    The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, in the equipment completion campaign carried out in Taiyuan City, has promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Regardless of large or small parts, they always try their best to help manufacture them for whoever comes to them. Some factories, which originally had machines "stillborn" due to a lack of parts, finally produced complete sets of equipment with the help of the Mining Machinery Plant.
    In early October of last year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China arranged the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment as an important political task. The task of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant was very heavy. The entire plant established a Metallurgical Equipment Manufacturing Headquarters, stamping each part of the metallurgical equipment with the "steel" character mark. "Steel" character parts spread rapidly through each process in the plant like urgent letters. At this time, the task of the processing workshop exceeded its manufacturing capacity by three or four times. From workers to workshop directors, everyone was anxious. However, just at this moment, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant needed ninety sets of oilers for rolling mill machines but had nowhere to process them, so they entrusted the task to this workshop. The oilers were only the size of cigarette boxes, but they were very precise and complex, making them difficult to manufacture. Under the circumstances at the time, refusing someone else's request would not have been criticized. The processing workshop was hesitating when workers from the tool workshop, the repair workshop, and fitters and welders all came forward and said: If you have any difficulties, everyone will help. If we work harder, our country will have many more rolling mills. The plant's Party committee and administrative leaders strongly supported the idea of undertaking the task. Soon, the slogan "Facing processing, supporting processing, rushing to manufacture ninety sets of oilers" spread throughout the plant. Various workshops contributed tools, lathes, and workers, throwing themselves into the battle of the processing workshop. In just five days, they completed the plan to manufacture ninety sets of oilers, without affecting the plant's own production in the slightest.
    The Jinxi Machinery Plant planned to have its first medium-sized seamless steel pipe rolling mill leave the factory on New Year's Day. However, the gear milling machine suddenly broke down, and the remaining two large "human" shaped gears could not be processed, and the factory's plan was about to be delayed. The factory had sent people to many factories for help, and finally came to the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant. At this time, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant had an even heavier task, with nearly a hundred machines, including seven rolling mills, ten drilling machines, and ten bending machines, to be assembled and leave the factory by New Year's Day. Wu Lansheng's gear hobbing team had a total of seven gear hobbing machines, each surrounded by a large pile of parts. The assembly workshop posted large-character posters every day, urging them to speed up. At this moment when every second counted, this team not only could not spare any time to process for the Jinxi Machinery Plant, but also did not have a "human" shaped gear hobbing machine. "Should we accept it or not?" Wu Lansheng called a meeting with the team to discuss it. Everyone said: "Other people's tasks are our tasks, no matter how great the difficulties, we must help!" But the plant's tasks cannot be delayed, and there is no "human" shaped gear machine, what should we do? After Wu Lansheng and the team's veteran workers Wang Daquan and Jin Renfa studied the problem, they decided to improve the tools and operating methods to overcome the difficulties. Veteran worker Jin Renfa led several skilled workers to improve a small gear hobbing machine to process "human" shaped gears. Wu Lansheng helped the workers grasp the milling cutter rules and improve production efficiency. As a result, nearly a hundred machines from this plant and the medium-sized seamless steel pipe rolling mill from the Jinxi Machinery Plant were all installed ahead of schedule on December 30th of last year.
    These are just two examples. However, these two examples embody a valuable idea that deserves to be continued and promoted.

    成人之美
    本报记者　张超
    太原矿山机器厂，在太原市开展的设备成套运动中，发扬了共产主义协作精神，不管大部件、小部件，谁家找到他们，他们总是想尽一切办法帮助制造。有些工厂原来因为缺少部件而机器“难产”，在矿山机器厂的帮助下，终于制成了成套的设备。
    去年10月初，中共太原市委把制造冶金设备当作重要的政治任务布置下来。太原矿山机器厂的任务十分繁重。全厂成立了冶金设备制造统帅部，在冶金设备的每个部件上盖上“钢”字印记。“钢”字号部件在全厂像鸡毛信一样，迅速传过每道工序。这时，加工车间的任务超过了制造能力三、四倍。从工人到车间主任，都在着急。但是，就在这当儿，太原重型机器厂需要九十套轨钢机上的给油器，无处加工，来委托这个车间制作。给油器只有香烟盒那么大小，但是很精密，很复杂，做起来十分费事。在当时的情况下，拒绝别人的委托是不会受到责怪的。加工车间正在犹豫，工具车间的工人、修配车间的工人和钳工、电焊工们都来说：你们有什么难处，大家伙帮忙。我们加把劲，咱们国家就能增加好多台轧钢机。厂党委和行政领导人员极力支持承担任务的意见。随着，在全厂传遍了“面向加工，支援加工，赶制九十套给油器”的口号。各车间抽出工具、车床、工人，连人带马投入了加工车间的战斗。只五天，就完成了制造九十套给油器的计划，同时丝毫没有影响本厂的生产。
    晋西机器厂计划让自己首次制造的中型无缝钢管轧机在元旦出厂。可是，铣齿轮的机器突然坏了，剩下两个大型“人”字齿轮无法加工，出厂计划眼看要脱期了。厂里曾派人到许多厂子求援，最后来到太原矿山机器厂。这时候，太原矿山机器厂的任务更重了，有七套轧钢机，十部打眼机、十部弯板机等近百台机器，要在元旦装配出厂。吴兰生滚齿机小组一共有七台滚齿机，每台旁边都堆了一大堆部件，装配车间每天给他们贴大字报，催他们加快速度。在这分秒必争的时刻，这个小组不仅腾不出手来给晋西机器厂加工，而且也没有“人”字滚齿机。“接不接受呢？吴兰生召集小组的人开会商量，大家都说：“别人的任务就是我们的任务，困难有天大，也要帮忙！”可是厂里的任务不能耽误呀，又没有“人”字齿轮机，怎么办呢？吴兰生和小组的老工人王大全、金仁发研究以后，决定改进工具和操作方法，来克服困难。老工人金仁发带领几个熟练工人改进了一台小型滚齿机，加工“人”字齿轮。吴兰生帮助工人掌握铣刀规律，提高生产效率。结果，这个厂的近百台机器和晋西机器厂的中型无缝钢管轧机，都提前在去年12月30日安装了起来。
    这不过是两个例子。然而就这两个例子便体现了一种值得继续发扬光大的宝贵的思想。
