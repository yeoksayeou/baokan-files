Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 7th. The Czechoslovak News Agency today issued a statement, authorized by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Trade, regarding the false accusation made by a Yugoslav official spokesperson on December 19th of last year, alleging that the Czechoslovak government had not fulfilled its obligations under the credit agreement. The statement said that the main representatives of Yugoslavia had shown no real interest in fulfilling the Czechoslovak-Yugoslav credit agreement in the past, and this remains the case.

The statement, in addressing the $75 million loan granted by Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia in 1956, to be delivered in the form of Czechoslovak industrial equipment and consumer goods, emphasized that Yugoslavia had not shown any interest in drawing on this credit from the outset, despite repeated urgings from Czechoslovakia to numerous Yugoslav official representatives and requests for Yugoslavia to draw on the loan.

The statement pointed out that the real reason for this lack of interest is the well-known tendency of Yugoslav economic organizations to purchase industrial equipment and consumer goods from companies in capitalist countries.

The statement said that in the past, Yugoslav leaders, such as Gretić, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Trade Committee, Niketić, the former Yugoslav Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and Vukmanović, the former Vice Chairman of the Yugoslav Federal Executive Council, had at least admitted that they were responsible for the failure to fulfill the credit agreement. The statement emphasized that the Yugoslav side is now attempting to shift the blame onto Czechoslovakia and even using this as a pretext to launch vicious attacks and slanders against Czechoslovakia.

The statement emphasized that this attempt to damage Czechoslovakia's reputation in the eyes of the world public is doomed to failure. The statement concluded, "There is no doubt that similar actions and distortions of facts by the Yugoslav side are not conducive to creating favorable conditions for the development of economic relations between the two countries."

### 捷通讯社受权就捷南贸易发表声明  南当局无意履行信贷协定

    捷通讯社受权就捷南贸易发表声明
    南当局无意履行信贷协定
    新华社布拉格7日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社今天就南斯拉夫官方发言人去年12月19日虚伪地指责捷克斯洛伐克政府没有履行信贷协定所规定的义务一事发表声明说，南斯拉夫的主要代表过去没有对履行捷南信贷协定表示真正兴趣，现在也是这样。
    捷克斯洛伐克通讯社是受捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易部的委托发表这项声明的。
    声明在谈到1956年捷克斯洛伐克给予南斯拉夫的一笔以捷克斯洛伐克工业设备和消费品来交付的七千五百万美元的贷款一事时强调指出，南斯拉夫在一开始就没有表示对支取这笔信贷感到任何兴趣，虽然捷克斯洛伐克曾经屡次催促许多南斯拉夫官方代表，并请南斯拉夫支取这笔贷款。
    声明指出，这种缺乏兴趣的真正原因是，南斯拉夫的各种经济组织具有这样一种众所周知的倾向：它们愿意向资本主义国家的公司购买工业设备和消费品。
    声明说，在过去，南斯拉夫领导人，例如对外贸易委员会副主席格雷蒂奇、前驻捷克斯洛伐克大使尼凯集奇以及南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会前副主席伏克曼诺维奇等，至少承认过，他们应对没有履行信贷协定负责。声明着重指出，现在南斯拉夫方面却企图把责任推到捷克斯洛伐克身上，并甚至借此对捷克斯洛伐克进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑。
    声明强调指出，这种企图在世界公众面前破坏捷克斯洛伐克声誉的作法，是注定要失败的。声明最后说，“毫无疑问，南斯拉夫方面的类似行径和歪曲事实的作法，对于为两国经济关系的发展创造有利条件是没有好处的”。
