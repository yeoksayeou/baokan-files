To increase soap production and conserve oils, commercial departments in various regions, in coordination with industrial departments, are actively promoting the use of acid clay as a substitute for oils in soap manufacturing. Currently, many provinces and cities, including Yunnan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, and Tianjin, have successfully experimented with acid clay soap production. Some regions have already begun mass production to meet market demand.

Using acid clay to produce soap is an innovation in the soap industry. This method was jointly created by the Chongqing Department Store Wholesale Station and the local soap factory. In November of last year, the Ministry of Commerce held an on-site conference in Chongqing to introduce this experience and decided to promote it nationwide.

Acid clay resources are abundant and widely distributed. Promoting acid clay soap opens up a new source of raw materials for soap production, which plays a significant role in conserving oils and increasing soap production. Chongqing plans to produce 660,000 boxes of acid clay soap this year, which can save 4,442 tons of wood oil. Acid clay soap has low costs and good quality. Based on learning from Chongqing's experience, the Guangzhou Department Store Wholesale Station has also used talc powder and white stone powder to produce talc soap and white stone scented soap, respectively, and plans to test-market them in Guangzhou.

    增产肥皂　节约油脂
    各地推广用酸性白土制造肥皂
    本报讯  各地商业部门协同工业部门，积极推广用酸性白土代替油脂制造肥皂。现在，云南、山西、山东、湖南、湖北、江苏、广东、北京、天津等许多省市都已用酸性白土试制肥皂成功；有些地区已经开始大量生产，供应市场需要。
    利用酸性白土制造肥皂是肥皂工业上的一个创举。这一方法，是重庆市百货批发站和当地肥皂厂共同创造的。商业部去年11月间曾在重庆召开现场会议介绍了这个经验，并且确定在全国推广。
    酸性白土资源很丰富，分布地区相当广。推广酸性白土肥皂，开辟了肥皂原料的新来源，对于节约油脂、增产肥皂有不小的作用。重庆市今年将生产六十六万箱酸性白土肥皂，可以节约木油四千四百四十二吨。酸性白土肥皂成本低廉，质量也好。广州市百货批发站在学习重庆经验的基础上，还用滑石粉和白石粉分别制成了滑石肥皂和白石香药皂，准备在广州试销。
