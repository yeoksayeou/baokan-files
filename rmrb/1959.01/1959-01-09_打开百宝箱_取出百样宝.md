　　Open the Treasure Chest, Take Out a Hundred Kinds of Treasure
　　I. Extracting Valuable Medicines from Pig Offal
　　Everyone knows that pork and pig offal are delicious foods. However, pigs are not just good for their meat; their internal organs can also be used to make many medicines and chemical preparations. Perhaps fewer people know this.
　　Workers at the Tianjin No. 2 Food Processing Factory call pigs "treasure chests." During the Great Leap Forward, they have been comprehensively utilizing pigs, making many valuable medicines urgently needed by medical departments, some of which are important raw materials for medicine manufacturing and industrial production. So far, this processing factory has successfully trial-produced forty-eight kinds of medicines and chemical preparations using pig eyeballs, testicles, brains, ovaries, spleens, spinal cords, and other by-products. Many of these products were made from discarded internal organs that were previously considered useless or of little use. Now, let's just explain the uses of a few products.
　　Pig brains used to be sold with the pig head. Now, pig brains are comprehensively utilized to extract cholesterol, lecithin, and cephalin, three kinds of medicines with high usage value. Cephalin, for example, is a good medicine for nourishing the brain and a good raw material for chemical reagents. This processing factory has now started production, with a daily output of four to five kilograms, and sometimes over ten kilograms.
　　Near the pig brain, there is something about the size of a soybean called the "pituitary gland." Previously, few people paid attention to its use. Now, the workers at this processing factory take it out and process it, extracting four kinds of medicines and two semi-finished products, including oxytocin for treating difficult labor in women, adrenocorticotropic hormone for treating rheumatic arthritis and heart failure, and anterior pituitary powder, the main raw material for hormone injections.
　　Pig bile is very bitter and was often treated as waste in the past. However, now, after refining, it can extract reddish-orange powder bilirubin and bile calcium salt, which are important raw materials for artificial bezoar. At the same time, it can also extract bile acids and bile salts, which can be used as raw materials for methyltestosterone and chemical reagents.
　　Pig hair and bones are burned into activated carbon, producing half a ton to a ton daily, becoming an important raw material for decolorization in industries such as printing and dyeing. Pig hair, after chemical treatment, is made into foam extinguishing liquid. Now, more than half of the foam extinguishing liquid used to manufacture fire extinguishers in the city is supplied by this processing factory.
　　The wastewater from refining lard at this factory used to flow down the drains every day in quantities of more than ten tons, and no one thought it was useful. Now, after certain chemical treatments, "meat paste" containing a large amount of protein can be extracted, which is an important raw material for scientific departments to culture bacteria.
　　These are just a few examples of comprehensive utilization, which is enough to prove that the pig is a "treasure chest."
　　II. Pig Manure Can Be Used for Biogas Power Generation, and to Extract Vitamin B12, Gasoline, Kerosene, and Asphalt
　　Pig manure has been fertilizer from ancient times to the present. However, the situation has now changed. The staff of the Tianjin No. 2 Food Processing Factory, as a result of vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of pig manure, have made a preliminary calculation: after full comprehensive utilization, the value recovered from one jin of pig manure is estimated to reach two jiao and six fen, which is more expensive than one jin of flour.
　　This year, after all of the factory's pig manure is used for biogas power generation, it can generate more than 1.9 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, enough for the factory's power and lighting needs. At the same time, there is surplus biogas to supply the factory's cars as fuel, saving about 100,000 kilograms of gasoline.
　　After fermenting pig manure to extract biogas, the remaining manure residue and liquid can be used to extract vitamin B12. This factory's product has now been supplied to relevant pharmaceutical departments for use. Vitamin B12 has a wide range of uses and can treat pernicious anemia. More importantly, it can treat radiation sickness, such as illnesses caused by atomic radiation, and this medicine also has significant effects.
　　The uses of pig manure are not limited to this. The manure residue left over from extracting vitamin B12 can be used as granular fertilizer. However, the workers in the food factory feel that it is too "lavish" to use it as fertilizer, so they have found a way to dry-distill the remaining manure residue to extract coke and coal tar. From the coal tar, after further processing and chemical fractionation, disinfectant has been successfully trial-produced, and kerosene, gasoline, asphalt, and other things have been refined.
　　While using biogas for power generation, the carbon dioxide mixed in the biogas can also be extracted. Carbon dioxide is processed and compressed into liquid carbon dioxide, and then turned into dry ice under high pressure. Using airplanes to scatter dry ice into the air causes the water vapor in the sky to condense into water droplets and fall, which is artificial rain. This processing factory has now extracted carbon dioxide and is preparing to produce dry ice this year.
　　It doesn't end there; the uses are still very broad. The biogas extracted from pig manure can also be used to refine artificial fibers, and coal tar can also be chemically fractionated into plastics... It's truly infinitely wonderful. (Attached image)

   打开百宝箱　取出百样宝
    一、从猪杂碎里提炼贵重药物
    谁都知道，猪肉和猪的内脏——猪杂碎，是很好吃的食品。可是，猪不只是肉可以吃，它的内脏还能够作出许多药品、化学制剂，这恐怕知道的人就比较少了。
    天津市第二食品加工厂工人把猪叫作“百宝箱”。他们在大跃进中综合利用猪身上的东西，已经做出很多非常宝贵又为医疗部门所迫切需要的药品，有的是制造医药和工业生产上的重要原料。到现在为止、这个加工厂已经利用猪眼球、睪丸，脑子、卵巢、脾脏、脊髓等副产品，试制成功了四十八种药品和化学制剂。这些产品，许多是过去认为用处不大，或者没有用处的废弃内脏制成的。现在只就几种产品说明它的用途。
    猪脑子，过去一般都是随着猪头一起卖掉。现在，猪脑子经过综合利用，能同时提炼出胆固醇、卵磷脂、脑磷脂等三种药品，使用价值很高。像脑磷脂，是一种补脑子的好药品，又是做化学试剂的好原料。这个加工厂现在已开始生产，每天产量四、五公斤，高的达到十公斤以上。
    在猪脑子附近，有个黄豆粒一般大小的东西，叫做“脑下垂体”，以前很少有人注意它的用处，现在这个加工厂的工人把它取出来，经过加工，已经提炼出四种药品和两种半成品，包括有医治妇女难产用的催产素，有治疗风湿性关节炎、心脏衰弱的促肾上腺皮质激素，还有作荷尔蒙注射液主要原料的脑下垂体前叶粉。
    猪胆很苦，过去多作废料处理。可是，现在经过精炼，能提取出桔红色的粉末胆红素和胆汁钙盐，都是人造牛黄的重要原料。同时，又能提炼胆汁酸和胆盐，可以作甲基睪丸素的原料和化学试剂。
    猪毛和骨头，工人们把它烧成活性炭，每天出产半吨到一吨，已成为印染等工业作脱色用的重要原料。猪毛经过化学处理，造成泡沫灭火液。现在全市有一半以上制造灭火器的原料泡沫灭火液，都是由这个加工厂供应的。
    这个工厂提炼猪油后的废水，过去每天经常有十多吨顺着地沟流掉，谁也没有认为是有用的东西。现在经过一定的化学处理，可以取出含有大量蛋白质的“肉膏”，是科学部门培养细菌的重要原料。
    这些，仅仅是综合利用的几个例子，已经足够证明猪是一个“百宝箱”了。
    二、猪粪可作沼气发电，可提取维生素B12和汽油、煤油、沥青
    猪粪，从古到今，就是肥料。可是，现在情况变了。天津市第二食品加工厂的职工，大搞猪粪综合利用的结果，初步算了一笔账：一斤猪粪经过充分的综合利用之后，收回的价值估计可以达到二角六分，比一斤面粉还贵。
    今年，这个厂的猪粪全部利用作沼气发电以后，一年能发电一百九十多万度，够全厂动力和照明用电，同时还有剩余的沼气供应厂内汽车当燃料，约节省汽油十万公斤。
    这个工厂用猪粪发酵取出沼气后，剩下的粪渣粪水，可以提炼出维生素B12。现在这个厂的这宗产品已经供应有关制药部门使用了。维生素B12，用途很广，可治恶性贫血病。更重要的是，它能医疗放射线病，像受原子辐射引起的病症，用这种药治疗也有显著效果。
    猪粪的用处还不只如此，提取维生素B12剩下的粪渣，可以作颗粒肥料；但是，食品工厂的工人们觉得把它当肥料使用，实在太“阔气”了，所以又想办法把剩下的粪渣，经过干馏提炼出焦炭和煤焦油。从煤焦油里，再经过加工和化学分馏，已试制成功臭药水，并炼出煤油、汽油、沥青等多种东西。
    在利用沼气发电的同时，还可以把沼气里混合着的二氧化碳抽出来。二氧化碳经过加工压缩成液体二氧化碳，然后再经过高压就变成干冰。用飞机把干冰撒到空中，使天空中的水蒸汽凝成水点下落，就是人工雨。现在这个加工厂已经取出了二氧化碳，准备今年生产干冰。
    到这里还不算完了，用途还非常广阔，从猪粪取出的沼气，又能提炼人造纤维，煤焦油还能化学分馏出塑料……真是其妙无穷。（附图片）
