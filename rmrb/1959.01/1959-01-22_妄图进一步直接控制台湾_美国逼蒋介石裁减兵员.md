Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, Dispatch from Taipei: The pressure from the United States to force the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities to reduce their troops is increasing daily. The English-language "China Post" in Taipei said on the 18th that the Kuomintang group's "Administrative Reform Committee has recommended a gradual reduction in troops." This news in the English-language newspaper in Taipei has attracted widespread attention in Taipei.

Since the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles in October last year, with the surfacing of the American conspiracies of "isolating Taiwan" and "trusteeship of Taiwan," the United States has been stepping up various arrangements to directly control Taiwan and reduce the power of the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities. This practice has become even more blatant in the past month. A senior official of the U.S. Department of Defense openly coerced on the 20th of last month, saying that if the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities "want the United States to continue to modernize their weapons and equipment, then they should reduce their armed forces to avoid a large drain on the economic strength of the United States and its allies." The commander of the U.S. forces invading Taiwan, Smott, followed up on the 25th of last month by saying, "The size of your (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) armed forces can only be based on your financial budget. As for the amount of U.S. military aid, it is based on how much the United States believes is needed to supply your troops." According to foreign news agencies from Taipei earlier this month, it is rumored that the U.S. military authorities have made a suggestion that the Chiang Kai-shek group retaining 300,000 troops or 20 full-strength divisions is already "enough." Currently, the Chiang army has about 550,000 troops. This "suggestion" from the United States is to have the Chiang army reduce 250,000 troops.

When the news in the "China Post" was published, Liu Hoto, the spokesperson of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Ministry of National Defense," immediately formally denied it through the Central News Agency on the same day, saying that "the news published by the 'China Post' has no factual basis."

Recently, there have been constant rumors from the United States that the U.S. coercion to reduce the Chiang Kai-shek group's troop numbers is related to the U.S. authorities' attempt to further completely control Taiwan. There are reports that once the Chiang army is reduced by half, complete U.S. control will be much easier. Recently, many remarks abandoning the Chiang Kai-shek group have appeared in American newspapers and publications. For example, U.S. Democratic Senator Engle said that Chiang Kai-shek "is a very dangerous guy." Former U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Intelligence Officer Zacharias said even more bluntly. He said, "Taiwan in the hands of the Kuomintang is a threat to U.S. security" and that "more control should be exercised over the situation there." He also nakedly exposed the ambitions of the United States, saying: "Taiwan should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations and ruled by the United States."

### 妄图进一步直接控制台湾  美国逼蒋介石裁减兵员

    妄图进一步直接控制台湾
    美国逼蒋介石裁减兵员
    新华社21日讯　台北消息：美国胁迫台湾国民党当局裁减军队的压力日益加大。台北英文“中国邮报”18日说，国民党集团“行政改革委员会已经建议逐渐裁减军队”。台北英文报纸上的这则消息，在台北引起了广泛的注意。
    去年10月间蒋介石、杜勒斯会谈以后，随着美国“孤立台湾”和“托管台湾”的阴谋表面化，美国加紧进行各种直接控制台湾、削减台湾国民党当局权力的部署。这种做法在最近一个月来更加彰明昭著了。美国国防部高级官员在上月20日公开胁迫说，如果台湾国民党当局“想要美国继续把它们的武器和装备进行现代化，那么它们就应该裁减武装部队，以免大量损耗美国和它的盟国的经济力量”。侵台美军司令斯摩特跟着在上月25日说，“你们（指蒋介石集团）武装部队的规模，只能根据你们的财政预算。至于美国的军事援助数量，是根据美国认为需要多少，才供给你们的部队的”。据外国通讯社本月初从台北透露，据传美军当局已经提出建议，认为蒋介石集团保留三十万人或二十个足额师已经“很够了”。目前蒋军约有五十五万兵员。美国的这个“建议”就是要蒋军裁减二十五万人。
    当“中国邮报”上的消息发表后，蒋介石集团“国防部”发言人柳鹤图立即于当天通过中央社正式予以否认，他说“中国邮报”刊载的“该项消息并无事实根据”。
    最近时期美国方面即不断传闻，美国胁迫削减蒋介石集团兵额，是同美国当局企图进一步完全控制台湾的阴谋有关。有消息说，一旦蒋军裁减一半，美国的完全控制就容易得多了。最近美国的报纸刊物上出现了许多抛弃蒋介石集团的言论。如美国民主党参议员恩格尔说蒋介石“是一个非常危险的家伙”。美国前海军少将情报官查加利亚斯说得更加露骨。他说，“台湾在国民党手里是对美国安全的一种威胁”，“应该对那里的局势加以更多的控制”。他还赤裸裸地暴露了美国的野心说：“台湾应该由联合国托管，而由美国统治”。
