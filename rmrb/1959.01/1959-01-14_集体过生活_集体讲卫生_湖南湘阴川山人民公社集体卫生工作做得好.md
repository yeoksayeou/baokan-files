Living Collectively, Practicing Hygiene Collectively
The Chuanshan People's Commune in Xiangyin, Hunan Does a Good Job in Collective Hygiene

According to a report from the New Hunan Daily, "The socialist scenery is beautiful, loud songs shake the hills, do a good job in hygiene and send away the 'plague gods,' men, women, old and young are all healthy..." This is a popular song in the Chuanshan People's Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, recently. Over the past few months, under the leadership of the Party, the commune has repeatedly fought and sent away plague gods such as schistosomiasis, malaria, hookworms, and roundworms. The entire commune has seen a clean and civilized scene. Currently, although it is the season for the prevalence of winter infectious diseases, thanks to the implementation of the principle of prevention first, no infectious patients can be found here. All people with labor ability are working, and the winter production tasks have been completed ahead of schedule.

In the early days of the establishment of the Chuanshan People's Commune, due to a lack of experience in organizing large-scale production and collective life, hygiene work did not keep up, some people became ill, and the attendance rate declined, which affected the normal development of production at that time. After the commune's Party committee discovered this problem, the secretary took personal command, organized four working groups, and went deep into the production teams for inspection. Based on the problems found, the Party committee held a meeting for analysis and research. Subsequently, the commune established a living welfare department, led by the deputy secretary of the Party committee, to take unified charge of living welfare and hygiene work. First, the public canteens of the entire commune were rectified, and cooks who were old, weak, or did not meet health standards were replaced. The houses of nurseries and kindergartens were also adjusted, and the sites were chosen in places with sufficient sunlight, good air circulation, and relatively spacious areas. The cooks, service personnel, educators, and nannies were all trained in rotation by the brigade as a unit, so that they could master certain hygiene knowledge and professional skills. Through publicity and mobilization, the entire commune also carried out four mass cleaning and hygiene campaigns, and the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and flies were also thoroughly cleaned up, giving the entire commune a new look in terms of hygiene.

In order to strengthen the management of collective hygiene, the commune also adopted some practical and feasible measures. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the commune hospital and brigade health stations divided their work scope and were responsible for specific areas. They not only carried out regular mobile medical services, but also went deep into the production teams, public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens to assist and guide the development of hygiene work, so that they could treat diseases if they were present, and work and conduct hygiene propaganda with the commune members if there were no diseases. In order to consolidate the various hygiene work, the Party committee put forward specific requirements for the hygiene work of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. For example: public canteens must use public chopsticks, bowls and chopsticks must be washed clean, do not eat cold or moldy food, the kitchen and dining hall must be kept clean at all times, etc.; kindergartens and nurseries are required to ensure that children eat well, sleep well, play well, and grow well, and to cultivate children's love of cleanliness and hygiene from an early age; for general environmental hygiene, requirements such as "six transformations" and "ten lights" were put forward.

Because the leadership took effective measures for hygiene work and the requirements were specific, the masses gradually developed the habit of caring about collective hygiene, so that the various requirements could not only be implemented, but also be adhered to. The commune members who eat in the canteen are all concerned about the hygiene work of the canteen. When old commune member Wu Guisheng saw that the drinking water pond was not clean, especially when it rained, he had to drink muddy water, which was very unsanitary. He used bamboo to install a simple tap water pipe to introduce well water into the kitchen, which not only enabled the commune members to drink clean and hygienic water, but also saved a lot of water-carrying labor. When commune member Huang Genshen saw that dust often fell into the pot when cooking, he used his brains and changed to a stove that burned firewood behind the wall. This not only avoided dust and debris from flying into the pot, but also prevented the kitchen and dining hall from being smoked black. This kind of stove that burns firewood behind the wall has now been widely promoted throughout the commune. The kindergarten of the Chuanshanping Brigade is close to the station, with many people coming and going, which easily spreads diseases. The teachers and nannies in the kindergarten have come up with some ways to prevent the spread of diseases. On the one hand, they pay attention to doing regular hygiene work, ensuring that the children eat cleanly, pay attention to adding or removing clothes for the children according to changes in the weather, and pay attention to the children's sleep; on the other hand, they set up an isolation room near the kindergarten, and once a sick child is found, he or she is treated and cared for in the isolation room. Female commune members Zhang Youmei and Liu Yaliang compiled a few catchy rhymes to praise the kindergarten: "Kindergarten, many benefits. The children grow up strong, everyone smiles. Both clean and lively, they can dance and sing. Thank the teacher for taking good care of them, and the mothers are full of energy in production."

The Banana Brigade is the brigade with the best environmental hygiene in the entire commune. Every household is very clean, and even the quilts and beds are neatly arranged. The hygiene work of other brigades is also well done. The commune members said that after collectivization, there are more conditions for doing a good job in hygiene. The commune has a public canteen, and there is no need to stir-fry and cook at home, so there is much less dust and garbage; the children enter the kindergarten, and no one throws broken bricks, tiles, or paper scraps; their lives are also more regular, and they can take a certain amount of rest time to clean. Therefore, environmental hygiene and personal hygiene have been greatly improved compared to before.

The medical and health personnel have played a great role in the good collective hygiene work of the Chuanshan Commune. In the struggle against diseases, they have given full play to their soaring enthusiasm and implemented the principle of prevention first. Recently, many areas have seen infectious diseases such as measles, pertussis, and influenza, but not in this commune. In addition to strengthening the prevention and publicity of winter infectious diseases, they have also taken many specific measures. For example: decocting realgar and Dryopteris crassirhizoma in water for internal use as a preventive medicine for measles; boiling roots of Aglaonema modestum in water together and letting the commune members eat it to prevent influenza; they also put Dryopteris crassirhizoma roots in the water tanks of each public canteen. At the same time, using mulberry roots and radish boiled as tea can prevent pertussis. These methods have achieved good results. The commune has also established a herbal medicine clinic, using various folk remedies and herbal medicines to treat commune members. The commune members thanked the medical staff for their hard work and enthusiastically sang mountain songs: "Medical technology has undergone a great revolution, folk methods of disease prevention are better than injections, the health of the commune members is guaranteed, and we are wholeheartedly increasing production."

### 集体过生活  集体讲卫生  湖南湘阴川山人民公社集体卫生工作做得好

    集体过生活  集体讲卫生
    湖南湘阴川山人民公社集体卫生工作做得好
    据新湖南报消息　“社会主义好风光，响亮歌声震山岗，搞好卫生送‘瘟神’，男女老少都健康……”这是湖南省湘阴县川山人民公社近来流行的一首歌子。几个月来，这个社在党的领导下，经过反复战斗，送走了血吸虫、疟疾、钩虫、蛔虫等瘟神，全社出现了一片清洁、文明的景象。目前，虽是冬季传染病流行的季节，但由于贯彻了预防为主的方针，这里却找不到传染病人，有劳动能力的人都出了工，冬季生产任务已提前完成。
    川山人民公社建立初期，由于对组织大规模生产和集体生活缺乏经验，卫生工作没有赶上去，病了一些人，出勤率有下降的现象，影响了当时生产的正常开展。公社党委发现这个问题后，书记亲自挂帅，组织了四个工作组，深入到生产队进行检查，并根据发现的问题，召开党委会，进行了分析和研究。接着，公社便成立了生活福利部，由党委副书记领导，把生活福利和卫生工作统一抓起来。首先整顿了全公社的公共食堂，把年老体弱和不合乎健康标准的炊事员调换下来；对托儿所和幼儿园的房子也进行了调整，园址都是选择阳光充足、空气流通和比较宽敞的地方，并以大队为单位，对所有炊事员、服务员、教养员、保育员轮流进行了一次训练，使他们能掌握一定的卫生常识和业务技术。全社通过宣传动员，还先后开展了四次群众性的清洁卫生大扫除运动，对蚊、蝇孳生场所也进行了较彻底的清理，使全社卫生面貌焕然一新。
    为了加强集体卫生的管理工作，公社还采取了一些切实可行的办法。公社医院和大队医疗站在党委的领导下，划分了工作范围，分片包干负责，不仅开展经常性的巡回医疗，还深入到生产队、公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，协助和指导开展卫生工作，做到有病治病，无病与社员一起劳动和开展卫生宣传。为了使各项卫生工作能巩固下来，党委对公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作提出了具体要求。例如：要求公共食堂一定用公筷，碗筷要洗干净，不吃冷饭冷菜和霉烂食物，厨房、饭厅要保持经常清洁等；要求幼儿园、托儿所的孩子们吃得好、睡得好、玩得好、长得好，要培养孩子们从小就爱清洁讲卫生；对一般环境卫生，提出了“六化”、“十光”等要求。
    由于领导上对卫生工作采取了有效措施，要求具体，群众便逐步养成了关心集体卫生的习惯，使得各项要求不仅能够贯彻，而且能够坚持。在食堂吃饭的社员，都关心食堂卫生工作。老社员吴桂生看到饮水塘不清洁，特别是下雨时要喝泥巴水，很不卫生，便用竹子安装了土自来水管，把井水引进厨房，这样不但使社员能喝到清洁卫生的水，还节省了许多挑水工。社员黄根深看到炒菜煮饭时，常有灰尘落到锅里，他就开动脑筋，改为隔墙烧火灶，这样不但避免了灰屑飞进锅里，还不会把厨房和饭厅熏得乌黑。现在全社已经普遍推广了这种隔墙烧火灶。川山坪大队的幼儿园靠近车站，来往人多，容易传染疾病，园内的老师和保育员们，便想了一些办法，预防疾病的传染。他们一方面注意搞好经常的卫生工作，让孩子们吃得干净，注意随气候的变化给孩子们增衣减衣，注意孩子们的睡眠；一方面，在幼儿园附近设了一间隔离室，一旦发现有病儿童，即在隔离室进行治疗和护理。女社员张佑梅、刘亚良编了几句顺口溜，赞扬幼儿园：“幼儿园，好处多。孩子长得壮，个个笑呵呵。既干净，又活泼，会跳舞，会唱歌。感谢老师带得好，妈妈生产劲头足。”
    芭蕉大队是全社环境卫生搞得最好的大队，家家户户都很清洁，连被子、床铺都是整整齐齐的。其他大队的卫生工作也都搞得好。社员们说，公社化以后，搞好卫生的条件更多了，社里有公共食堂，家里不要炒菜煮饭，灰屑、垃圾就少多了；孩子们进了幼儿园，烂砖烂瓦、纸纸屑屑没有人乱丢了；自己生活也较有规律，能抽一定休息时间打扫清洁。因此，环境卫生和个人卫生都较以前大大改善了。
    川山公社集体卫生工作搞得好，医药卫生人员起了很大的作用。他们在和疾病作斗争中，发挥了冲天的干劲，贯彻了预防为主的方针。最近，不少地区出现了麻疹、百日咳、流感等传染性疾病，这个公社却没有。他们除了加强对冬季传染性疾病的预防宣传外，还采取了许多具体措施。比如：用雄黄、管仲煎水内服，作为麻疹的预防药；用万年青根放在水里一起煮，让社员吃了预防流感；他们还在每个公共食堂水缸里放了管仲蔸，同时，采用桑树根煮萝卜作茶喝，可以预防百日咳，这些办法都收到了很好的效果。公社并成立了草药门诊部，利用各种土方土药为社员治病。社员们感谢医务人员的努力工作，热情地唱着山歌：“医药技术大革新，土法防病赛打针，社员健康有保障，我们一心把产增。”（附图片）
