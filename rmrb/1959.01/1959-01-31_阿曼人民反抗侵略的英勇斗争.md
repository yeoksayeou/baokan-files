    The Heroic Struggle of the Omani People Against Aggression
    Lu Ying
    The Omani people are a heroic people who love freedom and independence. Under the leadership of national leaders such as Sheikh Ghalib bin Ali, they are waging an armed struggle against British imperialist aggression. They are fighting selflessly for national independence and freedom, writing many moving epics, and winning the admiration of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people of all countries.
    Oman is an ancient country, containing the Imamate of Oman and the Sultanate of Muscat. Because it faces the Arabian Sea to the east and controls the mouth of the Persian Gulf to the north, occupying an important strategic position, it has been the target of Western colonialists since the 16th century. The oil resources of the Buraimi Oasis, coupled with the rich oil deposits within Oman, have made this area a place of contention for imperialists.
    In the early 16th century, Portuguese colonialists first occupied Muscat. British and French colonialists both attempted to seize it in the late 18th century. Unable to resolve their contention, they declared in 1862 that they would jointly "guarantee" the independence of Muscat. After years of intense competition, Britain finally gained the upper hand in the late 19th century, and since the 20th century has regarded Muscat as its exclusive domain.
    Britain has been attempting to rule Muscat and all of Oman through the Sultan of Muscat, its puppet. However, the Omani people launched an uprising in 1913, establishing the Imamate of Oman and refusing to recognize British "protection." According to the "Treaty of Seeb" signed in 1920 between Oman and the Sultan of Muscat through British mediation, the Sultan of Muscat recognized the independence of Oman and guaranteed not to interfere in its internal affairs. The signing of the "Treaty of Seeb" showed that Britain and the Sultan of Muscat de facto recognized the independent and autonomous status of the Imamate of Oman.
    However, in order to reverse its decline in the Middle East and to control the Buraimi Oasis and the oil-rich area of the Fahud oilfields, Britain desperately wanted to seize a straw in Oman. The British "Daily Mail" once clamored: "This may be our last chance in the Middle East. If we fail, there will be nothing left for us." Thus, Britain instigated its puppet, the Sultan of Muscat, to attack the Imamate of Oman in November 1955, and officially announced in February 1956 that Oman was under its rule. The Imam of Oman, Ghalib, was forced into exile. In February 1957, the Sultan of Muscat officially announced his "sovereign rule" over Oman. But the Omani people would not yield. The Imam of Oman at the time declared that he would defend his country to the end.
    In July 1957, the Imam of Oman returned to the mountains and led the people of the mountains to launch a new and larger-scale armed uprising in mid-July, and once recovered the capital, Nizwa, and many other areas, defeating the Sultan of Muscat's army commanded by British officers. However, due to Britain's deployment of modern army and air force and the use of various new weapons for bloody suppression, the people's uprising forces, after a month of fierce fighting, automatically withdrew from Nizwa and moved into the mountains to continue to launch extensive guerrilla warfare against the British aggressors. Since then, the Green Mountains area has become the center of the Omani revolution and the torch of the national liberation movement in southern Arabia.
    For nearly twenty months, the British aggressors, disregarding the severe condemnation of world public opinion, have continued to wage a war of aggression against the poorly armed Omani people. The British colonial army frequently bombed the Green Mountains area indiscriminately, brutally massacring peaceful Omani residents, creating a horrific scene. But they still cannot crush the Omani people's resolute resistance. The uprising forces have killed hundreds of British aggressors in the past month and shot down three British aircraft, and the guerrilla area has also expanded.
    In order to ease the Omani people's struggle, the British aggressors, through the Sultan of Muscat in November last year, proposed an unconditional ceasefire and negotiations between the two sides. The Omani people immediately saw through this delaying tactic. The Imam of Oman declared that the basis for negotiations should be the restoration of the Imamate to the situation before the British aggression, otherwise the Omani people would continue to resist the British aggressors until they achieved independence.
    Since the Omani people's uprising, American imperialism has adopted a double-dealing policy. Initially, the United States put on a vague posture, expressing "no bias towards either side." But in fact, on the one hand, it falsely accused the Omani people's just struggle as a "rebellion," and on the other hand, it wanted to use the Arab people's resistance to British colonialism to squeeze out Britain and let the United States "fill the vacuum." Because of this, the United States at the time expressed uneasiness about the British army's entry into the Buraimi Oasis, believing it was a "blow" to the United States. In order to suppress the anti-colonialist struggle in Oman and the Persian Gulf coast, the United States took advantage of the weakness of the British aggressors and conducted a dirty deal with Britain in London in August 1957 on the Oman issue. According to the representative of the Imam of Oman stationed in Cairo, the United States and Britain reached a temporary "compromise," "allowing the United States to have freedom of action in the Buraimi Oasis, while Britain has freedom of action in the Imamate of Oman." This is "the right to administer Oman belongs to Britain, and the right to exploit oil belongs to the United States." In this way, after giving up some of its interests, British imperialism obtained the support of the United States and let go to carry out bloody suppression of the Omani people.
    In the early days of the British offensive, the Imam of Oman appealed to the United States, requesting it to find ways to stop the British aggression. However, the United States ignored this. The United States also colluded with Britain to manipulate the Security Council to reject the Arab countries' accusation against British aggression against Oman. Prince Harsa, the Deputy Imam of Oman, pointed out sharply: "In this war, the United States supports Britain, just as it supported the aggressors in the Suez War. The United States provides Britain with ammunition and equipment, but because it is afraid of world public opinion, it does not provide soldiers."
    The Omani people's just struggle against aggression has received the enthusiastic support of all just people in the world. Arab public opinion in every occasion condemns the British imperialist's criminal aggression against Omani independence and supports the Omani people's right to independence. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in January 1958 adopted a resolution demanding the cessation of aggression in Oman, demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Arabian Gulf, and calling on the Asian and African people to recognize Omani independence.
    All countries in the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are on the side of the Omani people. In August 1957, the Soviet government issued a statement solemnly pointing out that the British massacre of the Omani people brutally violated the basic principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, and seriously trampled on the basic principles of humanity and morality.
    The Chinese people have deep sympathy for the Omani people's struggle and are deeply admired for the Omani people's spirit of hard struggle under extremely difficult conditions. Although our two countries are thousands of miles apart, we are on the same front against colonialism and for national independence. In August 1957, the Chinese government's note to the Arab League stated: "The Chinese government and people firmly oppose the British government's armed intervention against the people of the Imamate of Oman and the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents of Oman." In October of the same year, Chen Jiakang, the Chinese ambassador to Cairo, again expressed to Prince Harsa, the Deputy Imam of Oman: "The Chinese government and people sympathize with the Omani people's anti-colonialist struggle."
    The Omani people, like all nations striving for liberation, have realized from their own experience that national independence must be won and cannot be bestowed by others, and that the people's unwavering struggle is the only correct path to achieving national aspirations. Although the Omani people's struggle will still be arduous, the heroic people marching towards the road of national liberation cannot be subdued by the guns and bullets of the collapsing colonialists. The victorious banner of the Omani people will be raised high and fly over the skies of South Arabia.

    阿曼人民反抗侵略的英勇斗争
    鲁映
    阿曼人民是热爱自由和独立的英勇的人民。在加利卜·本·阿里教长等民族领袖的领导下，他们正在进行着反对英帝国主义侵略的武装斗争。他们为争取民族独立和自由，奋不顾身，坚持斗争，写下了不少可歌可泣的史诗，博得了所有爱好和平和独立自由的各国人民的景仰。
    阿曼是一个古国，阿曼境内有阿曼教长国和马斯喀特苏丹国。由于它东临阿拉伯海，北扼波斯湾口，占着重要战略地位，从十六世纪以来就一直成为西方殖民者争夺的目标。布赖米绿洲的石油资源，加上在阿曼境内也拥有丰富的石油矿藏，这一地区更成为帝国主义角逐的场所。
    十六世纪初，葡萄牙殖民者首先占领了马斯喀特。英法殖民者都在十八世纪末企图据为己有，由于两国相争不下，在1862年宣布共同“保证”马斯喀特的独立。经过多年的明争暗斗，英国终于在十九世纪末占了上风，从二十世纪以来一直把马斯喀特作为它的禁脔。
    英国一直企图通过它所支持的马斯喀特的苏丹，对马斯喀特和阿曼全境进行统治。但是，阿曼人民在1913年举行了起义，成立了阿曼伊斯兰教长国，不承认英国的“保护”权。根据1920年阿曼和马斯喀特苏丹经英国调停而签订的“西卜条约”，马斯喀特苏丹承认阿曼独立，并且保证不干涉它的内政。“西卜条约”的签订表明，英国和马斯喀特苏丹在事实上承认了阿曼教长国的独立自主地位。
    但是，英国为了挽回它在中东的颓势；为了控制布赖米绿洲和法胡德油藏丰富的地区，竭力想在阿曼抓住一根芦苇。英国“每日邮报”曾叫嚷说：“这可能是我们在中东最后的机会了。如果我们失策，就不会有什么东西给我们留下了。”这样，英国唆使它的傀儡马斯喀特苏丹于1955年11月进攻阿曼教长国，并且于1956年2月正式宣布把阿曼置于它的统治之下。阿曼教长加利卜被迫流亡国外。1957年2月，马斯喀特苏丹正式宣布它对阿曼的“统治主权”。但是阿曼人民是不会屈服的。阿曼教长当时宣布要保卫自己的国家到底。
    1957年7月，阿曼教长回到山区，于7月中旬率领山区人民发动了新的更大规模的武装起义，并曾一度收复了首府尼兹瓦和其它许多地区，击溃了由英国军官指挥的马斯喀特苏丹军队。但由于英国出动了现代化的陆军和空军，使用了各种新式武器进行血腥镇压，人民起义部队经过一个月的激战后，自动撤出了尼兹瓦，转入山区，继续对英国侵略者展开广泛的游击战争。从此，绿山地区就成为阿曼革命的中心和阿拉伯南部民族解放运动的火炬。
    近二十个月以来，英国侵略者不顾世界舆论的严厉谴责，继续进行着反对武装简陋的阿曼人民的侵略战争。英国殖民军经常对绿山地区滥施轰炸，惨无人道地屠杀阿曼和平居民，造成了惨绝人寰的景象。但是他们依然不能摧毁阿曼人民的坚决抵抗。起义部队最近一个月期间击毙了数百名英国侵略军，并击落了三架英国飞机，游击区也扩大了。
    英国侵略者为了缓和阿曼人民的斗争，在去年11月通过马斯喀特苏丹提出无条件停火、由双方举行谈判的建议。阿曼人民立刻识破了这个缓兵之计。阿曼教长声明：谈判的基础应该是恢复教长国在英国侵略前的情况，否则阿曼人民将继续抵抗英国侵略者，直到取得独立为止。
    自从阿曼人民起义以来，美帝国主义采取着两面三刀的政策。最初，美国装出一副暖昧的姿态，表示“不偏袒任何一方”。但事实上它一方面把阿曼人民的正义斗争诬称为“叛乱”，另一方面又想利用阿拉伯人民对英国殖民主义者的反抗，排挤英国，由美国来“填补真空”。正因为这样，美国当时对于英国军队开入布赖米绿洲一事表示不安，认为这是对美国的一个“打击”。为了镇压阿曼和波斯湾沿岸的反殖民主义斗争，美国利用了英国侵略者的弱点，在1957年8月同英国就阿曼问题在伦敦进行了一笔龌龊交易。据阿曼教长驻开罗代表揭露，美英达成了暂时的“妥协”，“让美国在布赖米绿洲有自由行动的权利，而英国则对阿曼教长国有自由行动的权利”。这就是“阿曼管理权归英国，石油开采权归美国”。这样，英帝国主义在让出部分的利益后，取得了美国的支持，放手对阿曼人民进行血腥的镇压。
    在英国进攻初期，阿曼教长曾向美国呼吁，要求设法制止英国的侵略行为。但是，美国对此置之不理。美国还串通英国操纵安理会拒绝讨论阿拉伯国家对英国侵略阿曼的控诉案。阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王曾一针见血地指出：“在这场战争中，美国支持英国，就像它在苏伊士战争中支持侵略者一样。美国向英国提供弹药和装备，但是由于害怕世界舆论，因而没有提供士兵”。
    阿曼人民反对侵略的正义斗争得到了全世界一切正义人民的热情支持。阿拉伯各国舆论在每一场合都谴责英帝国主义对阿曼独立的罪恶侵略，并且支持阿曼独立的权利。1958年1月亚非人民团结大会通过决议，要求停止在阿曼所进行的侵略，要求从阿拉伯海湾撤退外国军队，并号召亚非人民承认阿曼独立。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的所有国家都是站在阿曼人民一边的。1957年8月，苏联政府发表声明，严正指出，英国屠杀阿曼人民粗暴地破坏了国际法基本原则和联合国宪章，而且严重地蹂躏了人道和道义的基本原则。
    中国人民对阿曼人民的斗争抱着深切的同情，对阿曼人民在极端困难的条件下艰苦奋斗的精神感到十分钦佩。尽管我们两国远隔千里，但我们是站在反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的一条战线上的。1957年8月，我国政府致阿拉伯联盟的照会说：“中国政府和人民坚决反对英国政府对阿曼教长国人民的武装干涉和对阿曼的和平居民滥施轰炸”。同年10月，我国驻开罗大使陈家康又向阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王表示：“中国政府和人民同情阿曼人民反殖民主义的斗争”。
    阿曼人民和所有争取解放的民族一样，从自己的亲身经历中认识到：民族独立必须争取而不能靠人赏赐，人民坚持不渝的斗争是实现民族愿望的唯一正确的道路。虽然阿曼人民的斗争仍将是艰巨的，但向着民族解放大道迈进的英勇的人民，是濒于崩溃的殖民主义者的枪弹所不能制服的。阿曼人民胜利的旗帜将会高高升起，飘扬在南阿拉伯的上空。
