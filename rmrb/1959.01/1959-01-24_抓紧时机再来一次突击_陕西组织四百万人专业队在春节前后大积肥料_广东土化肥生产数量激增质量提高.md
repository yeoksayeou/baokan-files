Seize the Opportunity for Another Concentrated Push
    Shaanxi Organizes a 4 Million-Strong Professional Team to Accumulate Fertilizer on a Large Scale Before and After the Spring Festival
    Guangdong's Production of Native Chemical Fertilizer Surges in Quantity and Improves in Quality
    Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 23rd: After studying the needs of wheat field topdressing and autumn field base fertilizer this year, relevant leading departments in Shaanxi Province decided that the entire province will organize a 4 million-strong fertilizer accumulation professional team, combined with the broad masses, to accumulate 600 billion catties of fertilizer in a concentrated push for one month before and after the Spring Festival, and then switch to regular fertilizer accumulation. In order to better organize and lead this fertilizer accumulation campaign, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of Commerce, and the Chemical Industry Bureau jointly convened a provincial fertilizer work conference on the 22nd to summarize and exchange experiences in fertilizer accumulation and production last year and to formulate this year's fertilizer work plan. A broadcast mobilization meeting will be held on the 24th to call on the masses throughout the province to quickly launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign.
    Last year, in addition to the regular fertilizer accumulation, Shaanxi Province also selected opportunities to carry out four mass-based concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns: the concentrated fertilizer accumulation before spring plowing and sowing, which ensured wheat topdressing and autumn field base fertilizer; the summer fertilizer accumulation, which met the topdressing needs of autumn crops; the concentrated fertilizer accumulation in October, which provided sufficient base fertilizer for wheat sowing; and the large amount of topdressing fertilizer applied to wheat fields during the concentrated fertilizer accumulation in December. During the last mass-based concentrated fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, an average of about one million people participated every day for three weeks. In the campaign, various places found ways to accumulate, make, compost, burn, smoke, steam, exchange, pick up, and sweep up fertilizer. In Mizhi County alone, the masses were mobilized to find more than 90 kinds of fertilizer sources. All localities rationally arranged labor, formed professional teams, and combined with the broad masses to launch fertilizer accumulation and production campaigns. Various localities widely promoted methods such as smoking fertilizer along the fields, setting up chemical fertilizer plants in the fields, and moving sheep pens up the mountains to accumulate and produce fertilizer locally, using it on the spot, accumulating, transporting, and applying fertilizer at the same time, improving various transportation tools and fertilization methods, and improving fertilizer accumulation efficiency. Chang'an County vigorously improved tools during fertilizer accumulation, creating 22,000 light and convenient vehicles in half a month. In addition to accumulating more than 14 billion catties of fertilizer in one month, the county's 220,000 mu of wheat also received a general topdressing.
    Relevant leading authorities in Shaanxi Province believe that these concentrated fertilizer accumulations not only meet the needs of agricultural seasons, but also have more natural fertilizer sources during these times, and it is also possible to allocate more manpower for fertilizer accumulation. Therefore, the characteristics of the concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign are: concentrated fertilizer accumulation force, short time, and great effect. This method of combining regular fertilizer accumulation with organized concentrated pushes is a very good experience. Last year, thanks to the province's adherence to this method, the amount of fertilizer accumulated was ten times that of 1957.
    This year, Shaanxi Province has a total of about 30 million mu of overwintering wheat, rapeseed, and small summer fields, which require a large amount of topdressing; early spring crops and cotton fields also need to prepare a large amount of base fertilizer, and more manpower can be allocated during this time. Therefore, while arranging the labor required for water conservancy, sideline occupations, transportation, and other aspects throughout the province, relevant departments decided to form a 4 million-strong professional team for fertilizer accumulation and production, and in conjunction with the mass fertilizer accumulation campaign, starting now, for one month before and after the Spring Festival, combined with the Spring Festival patriotic health campaign, carry out a large-scale mass-based concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign. Relevant departments also require each professional team to implement a responsibility system of setting tasks, determining the number of people, and determining the quantity and quality of fertilizer, implement over-fulfillment rewards, and stipulate that household fertilizer accumulation is priced according to quality and purchased according to price (cash and work points) to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, attention should be paid to improving fertilizer quality, increasing fine fertilizer, consolidating and improving native chemical fertilizer plants, strengthening the management of human and animal manure, improving the methods of use, and maximizing fertilizer efficiency.
    Our newspaper's dispatch from Guangzhou on the 23rd: Guangdong Province, while accumulating large amounts of natural fertilizer, has launched a mass campaign to manufacture native chemical fertilizer. According to statistics from relevant departments of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: in the forty days from December of last year to the beginning of January this year, nearly six million tons of native chemical fertilizer have been manufactured for spring plowing production.
    Guangdong Province established more than 180,000 native chemical fertilizer plants last year, producing dozens of kinds of native chemical fertilizer. This year, in order to manufacture more native chemical fertilizers with higher fertilizer efficiency, many areas have implemented a combination of regular production and large-scale concentrated production, launching a mass-based native fertilizer production campaign. The Zhanjiang Special Zone produced only nearly 300,000 tons of native chemical fertilizer in October and November last year. After taking various measures, from December of last year to the beginning of January this year, it produced more than 1.5 million tons of native chemical fertilizer. Liangyang County only produced about 60,000 tons in December last year. Recently, after organizing more than 16,000 people to concentrate on native chemical fertilizer production, a climax quickly formed. From January 1st to 20th, it completed 80% of the 750,000 tons of native chemical fertilizer needed for spring plowing. The county has begun to implement the method of assigning people, equipment, and output, and consolidating the existing 800 native chemical fertilizer factories in order to gradually transition to regular production.
    In order to continuously popularize and improve native chemical fertilizer production, most special zones and some counties recently focused on exchanging and promoting the experience of various places in manufacturing high-quality native chemical fertilizer at on-site meetings. After Liangyang County implemented the system of cadres residing in factories and inspecting and accepting on the spot, not only did fertilizer production efficiency double, but also native chemical fertilizers of higher quality than in the past were produced.
    How to solve the source of raw materials for native chemical fertilizer production to ensure the needs of future production is a common concern in the manufacture of native chemical fertilizers in various parts of Guangdong Province. After many places organized small-scale geological survey teams to explore and vigorously mobilized the masses to investigate and report mineral deposits, a large number of mineral fertilizer resources have been discovered. Zengcheng County alone has identified 33 kinds of mineral fertilizer resources totaling more than 90 million tons. Yingde County also discovered 18 phosphate mines in a few days after criticizing the idea of ​​not having phosphate fertilizer. (Zhou Qishu)

    抓紧时机再来一次突击
    陕西组织四百万人专业队在春节前后大积肥料
    广东土化肥生产数量激增质量提高
    本报西安23日电　陕西省有关领导部门，在研究了今年麦田追肥和秋田底肥的需要以后，决定全省组织四百万人的积肥专业队，与广大群众相结合，在春节前后一个月，突击积肥六千亿斤，然后再转入常年积肥。为了更好的组织领导这次积肥运动，22日省农林厅、商业厅、化工局联合召开了全省肥料工作会议，总结交流了去年积肥造肥经验，制订了今年肥料工作规划。24日将召开广播动员大会，号召全省群众迅速开展积肥运动。
    去年陕西省除了常年的积肥以外，还选择时机，开展了四次群众性突击积肥运动：即春耕播种以前的突击积肥，保证了小麦追肥和秋田底肥；夏季积肥又满足了秋季作物的追肥需要；10月份的突击积肥，给小麦播种提供了足够的底肥；12月份又在突击积肥中给麦田施了大量的追肥。最后一次群众性突击积肥造肥运动，突击三周，参加的人每天平均有一百万左右。各地在运动中找到了积、制、沤、烧、熏、蒸、换、拾、扫肥等门路。单是米脂县发动群众找到的肥源就有九十多种。各地都合理地安排了劳动力，组成专业队，和广大群众相结合，展开积肥造肥运动。各地普遍推广了田边熏肥，田间设化肥厂，羊圈上山等办法就地积肥造肥，就地使用，边积边运边施肥，改进了各种运输工具和施肥方法，提高了积肥效率。长安县在积肥中大力改进工具，半月造出轻便车子二万二千辆。一个月内除积肥一百四十多亿斤外，全县二十二万亩小麦还普遍追肥一次。
    陕西省有关领导机关认为这几次突击积肥，既适应农时需要，而这些时间有较多的自然肥源，也可能抽出较多的人力积肥，所以突击积肥运动的特点是：积肥力量集中，时间短，收效大。这种常年积肥和组织突击结合的办法是一条很好的经验。去年由于全省坚持了这个办法，积肥数量为1957年的十倍。
    今年陕西全省共有越冬小麦、油菜、小夏田三千万亩左右，需要大量追肥；早春作物和棉田，还需要准备大量的底肥，这个时间也可以抽出较多的人力。因此，有关部门在安排全省水利、副业、运输等方面所需劳动力的同时，决定组成四百万人的积肥造肥专业队，并与广大群众积肥运动相结合，从现在开始，在春节前后一个月，结合春节爱国卫生运动，开展一次大规模的群众性突击积肥运动。有关部门还要求各专业队执行定任务、定人数、定肥料数量和质量的责任制度，实行超额奖励，并规定家庭积肥按质论价，按价（现金和工分）收购，激发群众的积肥积极性。同时要注意提高肥料质量增加细肥，整顿和提高土化肥厂，加强对人畜粪的保管，改进使用方法，发挥肥效。
    本报广州23日电　广东省在大积自然肥的同时，掀起了一个制造土化肥的群众运动。据中共广东省委有关部门统计：从去年12月至今年1月上旬止的四十天内，已为春耕生产制造好土化肥近六百万吨。
    广东省去年建立了土化肥厂十八万多座，生产了几十种土化肥。今年为了制造更多的肥效较高的土化肥，不少地区实行经常性生产和大规模突击生产相结合，掀起了一个群众性的土法制肥运动。湛江专区去年10月和11月两个月制造的土化肥只有近三十万吨，采取各种措施后，从去年12月至今年1月上旬，即生产出土化肥一百五十多万吨。两阳县去年12月份只生产六万吨左右，最近组织了一万六千多人突击制土化肥后，很快就形成高潮，1月1日到20日就完成了春耕需要土化肥七十五万吨的80％。这个县已开始实行定人、定设备、定产量的办法，整顿现有的八百座土化肥工厂，以便逐步转为经常性生产。
    为使土化肥生产能不断普及和提高，最近大多数专区和部分县在现场会议上着重交流和推广了各地制造优等土化肥的经验。两阳县实行了干部住厂，就地检查验收制度后，不仅制肥效率提高二倍，而且制出了质量较过去高的土化肥。
    如何解决制土化肥的原料来源以保证今后生产的需要，是广东省各地制造土化肥中普遍重视的问题。许多地方组织了小型地质勘察队去探勘和大力发动群众查矿报矿后，已发掘了大量矿肥资源。仅增城县就已查出各种矿肥资源三十三种共九千多万吨。英德县在批判无磷肥的思想后，在几天内也发现磷矿十八处。　（周齐枢）
