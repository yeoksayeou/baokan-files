How to Compost Manure
Chen Shangjin

Regarding the issue of fertilizer accumulation, many methods have been proposed, such as accumulation, production, composting, smoking, burning, digging, steaming, exchanging, picking up, and sweeping, totaling ten major categories, all of which are very important. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on composting manure.

What is Composting Manure?

What is composting manure? Composting manure is the process of using organic materials such as wild grass, fallen leaves, straw, peat, etc., mixed with a small amount of soil, an appropriate amount of livestock manure and human excrement, and sufficient moisture, which are then decomposed by microbial activity. Why compost? First, organic materials such as wild grass and straw are not physically suitable for direct use as fertilizer. When applied to the field, they are airy and draughty, which is detrimental to land preparation, moisture retention, sowing, emergence, and rooting. Second, organic materials cannot be absorbed and utilized by plants without microbial decomposition. Third, organic materials decompose slowly when buried in the soil, making them difficult to utilize during crop growth. Composting and ripening can greatly improve the quality of fertilizer and accelerate its utilization.

How to Compost? Composting methods in China are diverse. Because the composting materials and environmental conditions vary, it is impossible to demand uniformity. However, if you want to compost manure well, you must grasp a principle, which is to provide a good environment for microbial fermentation: sufficient moisture, suitable nutrients, appropriate temperature, and sufficient air. If you can do the above, you can definitely compost well.

Two Methods of Composting Manure

Composting in China can be roughly divided into two methods: soaking and composting, and there are also methods that combine soaking and composting first, then heap composting. For example, composting manure in a water pit, putting materials such as straw, weeds, and livestock manure into the water, can be composted after a period of time, which belongs to the soaking method. When soaking, the moisture is sufficient, and the straw and weeds contain a large amount of carbohydrates, which are the main nutrients for microorganisms. Livestock manure contains a large number of microorganisms and the nitrogen and other nutrients needed for microbial reproduction, which can promote fermentation. However, the rapid decomposition of organic matter requires air. During soaking, there is insufficient air under the water surface, so the ripening is slower. If it can be soaked for a short period of time first, so that the straw absorbs enough moisture, and then taken out for composting, the straw can be composted quickly. This is because when it is piled up, there is sufficient air, and microorganisms use the oxygen in the air to turn some organic matter into carbon dioxide that escapes, and some into humus that remains, and the straw can be decomposed quickly.

There is also a method of direct composting, using wild grass, straw and other materials to make compost, rapid compost, and high-temperature compost, all of which belong to this category. The composting materials must contain a large amount of organic matter and be mixed with an appropriate amount of human excrement and livestock manure. When stacking, add sufficient moisture, which should account for 60%-80%; the pile is generally four to five feet high, five to six feet wide, and the length is determined by the material; the outside of the pile is covered with soil and mud to preserve moisture and temperature, and also to reduce the loss of nitrogen. Digging ventilation ditches on the ground to allow air to enter the lower layer of the pile to promote fermentation is a good method. In order to preserve moisture and temperature, it can also be piled in shallow pits of one to two feet; in summer, the temperature is high and the rainfall is high, ground piling can be used. It is necessary to mix some soil into the compost, which can play the role of water and fertilizer retention and neutralization of acidity, but the amount should not be too much, so as not to affect air permeability and delay ripening. Lime can also neutralize acidity, but it should not be too much, because too much lime will increase alkalinity and promote the loss of nitrogen.

Generally, livestock manure contains a large number of fiber-decomposing bacteria, so mixing livestock manure in the compost can advance fermentation. If there is a shortage of livestock manure locally, old, rotten compost and soil manure can be used as starters.

After stacking for a period of time, the pile should be turned, the ripening situation checked and water added, and the inside and outside mixed and ventilated once, which has a great effect on accelerating ripening.

How to Determine if Composting is Complete

In cold places, manure freezes into ice in winter, and microorganisms cannot move to decompose and ferment. The masses have created a method of adding a little fire under the manure pile to raise the local temperature to ten to twenty degrees Celsius, so that bacteria can begin to move. The temperature generated by bacterial reproduction can thaw the manure pile and advance ripening. Only in the northernmost regions of China is it necessary to use fire to heat up the manure. In most areas of North and Northwest China, choosing a sunny and relatively warm location, using more livestock manure, and paying attention to insulation, the manure can be composted well in winter without artificial heating.

What is called ripening? Ripening is to compost the manure well and thoroughly. This is a microbial decomposition process and is not mainly based on temperature heating. If it is not decomposed by microorganisms, and only relies on heating and boiling with fire, a lot of nitrogen will be lost, and the compost cannot be ripened, which is worthy of attention.

    怎样沤粪
    陈尚谨
    关于积肥问题，已经提出来不少办法，如积、制、沤、熏、烧、挖、蒸、换、拾、扫等十大项，都很重要。现仅就沤粪提出一些意见。
    什么叫沤粪
    什么叫沤粪？沤粪就是用野草、落叶、秸秆、草炭等有机物质，掺和少量的土，适量的牲口粪和人粪尿，加入充足的水分，经过微生物活动分解而成的。为什么要沤？首先因为野草、秸秆等有机物质，直接用作肥料，物理性状很不好，施到地里，透气跑风，对整地、保墒、播种、出苗、扎根都很不利。第二、有机物质不经过微生物的分解，植物不能吸收利用。第三、有机物质埋在土壤里，分解比较慢，在作物生长期间，很难利用，经过沤制腐熟，可以大大提高肥料的质量和促进肥料被利用的速度。
    怎样来沤？我国沤粪方法，是多种多样的，因为沤粪材料不同，环境条件不同，不可能要求一律。但是若想把粪沤好，一定要掌握一个原则，就是给予微生物发酵所需要的良好环境：充足的水分，适宜的营养物质，适合的温度和足够的空气。若能将以上事情做到，一定可以沤好。
    沤粪的两种方法
    我国沤粪大致可以分为泡沤和堆沤两种方法，也有采用先泡沤后堆沤相结合的办法。如在水坑里沤粪，将秸秆、杂草、牲口粪等材料，放进水里，经过一个时期，可以沤好，这是属于泡沤的办法。在泡沤的时候，水分是很充足的，秸秆、杂草里含有大量碳水化合物，是微生物的主要养分，牲口粪里含有大量微生物和微生物繁殖所需要的氮素和其他养分，可以促进发酵。但是，有机物质的迅速分解，是需要空气的，在泡沤时水面下的空气不足，所以腐熟较慢。如能先泡一个短时期，使秸秆吸足水分，取出来再堆沤，秸秆很快就可以沤好。这是因为堆起来，有了充足的空气，微生物利用空气中的氧，使一部分有机物变成二氧化碳跑掉，一部分变成腐植质留下来，秸秆很快就可以分解。
    也有直接采用堆沤的办法，用野草、秸秆等材料制成堆肥，速成堆肥、高温堆肥，都是属于这一种。堆沤的材料要含有大量有机物质，并要混合适量的人粪尿和牲口粪。在堆积的时候，要加入足量的水分，水分要占60％—80％；堆一般四—五尺高，五—六尺宽，长度按材料决定；堆的外面盖土糊泥，以便保存水分和温度，还可以减少氮素的丢失。为了供给空气，在地面上挖通气沟，使空气可以进入堆的下层，促进发酵，是很好的办法。为了保存水分和温度，也可以在一—二尺浅坑内堆积；夏季温度高，雨量多，可以采用地面堆积。堆肥里混加一些土是必要的，它可以起着保水保肥和中和酸度的作用，但是数量不宜过多，以免影响透气，推迟腐熟。石灰也可以中和酸度，但不宜过多，因为石灰过多，增加碱度，会促使氮素的损失。
    一般牲口粪里，含有大量纤维分解菌，所以堆肥里掺合牲口粪，可以提早发酵。若当地牲口粪缺乏，可以用陈旧腐熟堆肥、土粪来作引子。
    堆积到了一个时期，要进行翻堆，检查腐熟情况并添加水分，并使内外混合，通气一次，对加速腐熟作用很大。
    怎样才算沤透
    在寒冷地方，冬季粪冻成冰，微生物不能活动分解发酵。群众创造在粪堆下面，稍加一点火，使局部温度升高到摄氏十度到二十度，细菌就可以开始活动，由于细菌繁殖发生的温度，可以使粪堆开冻，提早腐熟。只有在我国最北面的地区，才需要用火加温的办法，华北、西北大部分地区，选择向阳比较暖和的地点，多用一些牲口粪，注意保温，不用人工加热，也可以在冬天将粪沤好。
    什么叫做腐熟？腐熟就是把粪沤好、沤透，这是一个微生物分解过程，并不是以温度加热为主。若不经过微生物的分解，仅靠用火加热煮熬，氮素要丢失很多，也不能使堆肥腐熟，是值得注意的。（附图片）
