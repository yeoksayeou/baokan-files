    The enthusiastic visitors to the National Agricultural Exhibition generally believe that this exhibition, which showcases the great leap forward in agriculture, has provided them with a vivid lesson and instilled them with boundless enthusiasm.
    The National Agricultural Exhibition has been open for five days. In these five days, over 52,900 visitors have braved the cold to visit the exhibition. This includes the 6,000 delegates attending the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, audiences from various agencies, factories, schools, and military units in the capital, as well as visitors from most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, and many foreign guests. According to the unified visitation arrangements, formal visiting delegations from various regions will gradually arrive in Beijing in mid-January.
    "This exhibition is a perfect microcosm of the great leap forward in China's agriculture, and it also shows an even brighter future." This is the unanimous reflection of many visitors. In recent days, the 6,000 delegates attending the conference of advanced agricultural units have been diligently visiting and learning at the exhibition. Tian Yingjun, a representative from Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, said that the greatest education he received this time was understanding why their wheat yield was not as high as that of Yanshi, Henan, and their corn yield was not as high as that of Shouzhang, Shandong, mainly because the "Eight-Point Charter" had not been fully implemented. Similarly, Jiang Zaiqiu, a famous labor model from Guangxi, clarified this time why their peanut yield was not as good as that of Hongan County, Hubei. He said: We are not as good as Hongan County in terms of deep plowing, fertilization, seed selection, and pest control when growing peanuts.

    农业展览会给观众增干劲长知识
    本报讯　参观全国农业展览会的热情的人们普遍认为：这个表现农业大跃进的展览会给自己上了生动的一课，给自己增加了无限的干劲。
    全国农业展览会开幕已经五天了。五天来，冒着严寒参观展览会的观众已达五万二千九百多人。包括出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的六千代表，首都各机关、工厂、学校、部队和来自全国大部分省、市、自治区的观众以及许多外宾。按统一的参观安排，各地正式的参观团要在1月中旬才会陆续到京。
    “这个展览会是我国农业大跃进的一个完美的缩影，而且看到了更美的远景。”这是许多观众的一致反映。连日来，出席农业先进单位代表会议的六千代表在展览会上更是孜孜不倦地参观学习。陕西盩厔县代表田英俊说，他这次受到的最大的教育，就是明白了为什么他们的小麦产量不如河南偃师高，玉米产量不如山东寿张高，主要就是“八字宪法”执行得还不全面。同样，广西著名劳动模范蒋在球这次弄清楚了他们的花生产量不如湖北红安县的道理。他说：我们种花生在深耕、施肥、选种、除虫等几个方面作得都不如红安县好。
