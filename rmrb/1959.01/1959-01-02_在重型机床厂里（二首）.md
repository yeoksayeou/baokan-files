    In the Heavy Machine Tool Factory (Two Poems)
    Hong Yang
    Spinning to the rhythm of the Great Leap Forward, we spin day and night!
    We spin with time, yet leave time behind!
    Don't嫌 us for being monotonous, mechanically repeating the same action;
    We are advancing at a rapid pace, one turn crossing a century!
    In this ceaseless spinning, steel is transformed into machines!
    Standing, sitting, lying down, all kinds of machine tools.
    In this ceaseless spinning, barren hills rise into large factories!
    In this ceaseless spinning, the fields are filled with tractors!
    In this ceaseless spinning, the newest and most beautiful pictures appear!
    In this ceaseless spinning, the newest and most beautiful songs resound!
    Spinning to the rhythm of the Great Leap Forward, we spin day and night!
    Time is quietly receding, one turn crossing a century!

    New products in our factory,
    Every day there are new products,
    Every day I have fresh feelings,
    Wanting to sing a new song.
    Day after day passes,
    The ode is not yet written;
    That latest new product,
    Is surpassed by another this morning!
    Who should my song be for?
    There are simply too many new products!
    Today it's the C527 vertical lathe,
    Tomorrow it's the 6642 gantry milling machine.
    Today it's a huge gantry planer,
    Tomorrow it's a precision gear hobbing machine!
    One after another peak of science and technology,
    In the blink of an eye, turns into hills!
    One machine after another,
    New products beget new products;
    A surge of fervent emotion,
    Vibrates in my throat.
    I want to sing loudly,
    Praising all these new products!
    Praising the new people of our working class,
    Who create miracles with their hands!
    Praising the vanguards of the technological revolution,
    Who climb the peaks of science!
    Praising the heroes of the Great Leap Forward,
    They are the people who exert full effort.
    Praising the Party's General Line,
    It is a long sail pregnant with wind,
    Our motherland's magnificent fleet,
    Is riding the wind and waves, advancing rapidly!

    在重型机床厂里（二首）
    洪洋
    旋转和着大跃进的节奏，我们日夜不停地旋转！我们踏着时间旋转，又把时间抛在后边！你别嫌我们单调，机械地重复着一个动作；我们正在飞速前进，一转跨过一个世纪！在这不息的旋转里，钢铁化成了机器！站着的、坐着的、躺着的，各式各样工作母机。在这不息的旋转里，荒山耸起了大工厂！在这不息的旋转里，田野布满了拖拉机！在这不息的旋转里，出现着最新最美的图画！在这不息的旋转里，响起最新最美的歌声！和着大跃进的节奏，我们日夜不停地旋转！时间在悄悄地往后退，我们一转跨过一个世纪！
    新产品在我们的工厂里，每天都有新产品，每天我怀着新鲜的感情，想要唱一首新的歌曲。一天一天过去了，颂歌还没有写成；那一台最近的新产品，又被今晨的另一台盖过！我的歌该唱给谁呢？新产品实在太多！今天是C527的立车，明天是6642的龙门铣。今天是巨大的龙门刨床，明天是精密的滚齿机！一个个科学技术的高峰，转眼就化成了丘陵！一台一台又一台，新产品又生出了新产品；一股激越的感情，震颤在我的喉头。我要放声高歌，歌颂这一切的新产品！歌颂用双手创造奇迹的，我们工人阶级的新人！歌颂技术革命的先锋，攀登着科学高峰的人。歌颂大跃进的英雄，他们是鼓足干劲的人。歌颂党的总路线，它是一面饱孕着风的长帆，我们祖国雄伟的船队，正在乘风破浪，飞速向前！
