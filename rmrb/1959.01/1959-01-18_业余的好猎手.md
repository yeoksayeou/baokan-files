A Good Amateur Hunter
Liu Xianxi

　　Early morning, in the quiet depths of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, a crisp gunshot suddenly rang out. At the sound of the shot, several plump gray squirrels tumbled from the branches. At this moment, a young man holding a gun quickly ran out to collect his prey, then went into the forest farm and began his day's work of logging.
　　This amateur hunter's name is Lü Shiqin, and he is a lumberjack in the Eighth Forestry Farm of the Fenglin Bureau in the Yichun Forestry Area. Every morning, when people are still sound asleep, he always brings his hunting gun and ammunition and is the first to arrive in the forest. At this time, clever and cunning gray squirrels emerge in groups from the pine tree holes and climb onto the trees to find pine cones. Lü Shiqin takes this opportunity to display his superb marksmanship, aiming at the gray squirrels, almost one shot per squirrel, and the gray squirrels fall down as if being "called out" by name. At noon, when everyone goes back to eat, he hurriedly finishes his packed lunch and continues to take the time to go into the woods to hunt. When work is over in the evening, he carries his prey, carries his shotgun, and walks home with a triumphant smile, and may even add some more achievements on the way home.
　　In this way, this amateur hunting enthusiast, using his spare time and Sundays, has hunted more than two hundred gray squirrels in the past two months, producing more than two hundred valuable gray squirrel pelts for the country. Therefore, he is known as an amateur "hunting expert" in the Yichun Forestry Area.
　　Only a few months ago, he knew nothing about hunting. When the Yichun Forestry Area launched a mass hunting production campaign, he enthusiastically threw himself into this production upsurge. In the beginning, he couldn't figure out the knack and wasted a lot of effort. Sometimes he carried his gun in the woods for a long time, getting tired and sore, only to shoot two gray squirrels, while others shot more than a dozen in a short time.
　　"What's going on here?" he pondered. "Hard work must be combined with skill; without understanding the habits and life patterns of gray squirrels, running around the mountains is still not enough." Every spare moment, he quietly ran into the woods, squatted under the pine trees to observe. After a period of time, he discovered that every dawn, groups of gray squirrels always run from their old home—the smelly pine forest—to the fruit pine forest to find pine nuts to eat; at noon, the gray squirrels play on the sunny pine trees. After many careful observations, he gradually grasped the activity patterns of the gray squirrels. Even if the gray squirrels are cunning and clever, they cannot escape the palm of this amateur hunting expert.

    业余的好猎手
    刘先希
    清晨，在静悄悄的小兴安岭密林深处，突然传来了清脆的枪声。枪声响处，几只浑肥的灰鼠子从树枝上滚了下来。这时，一个端枪的年轻人迅速地跑出来收拾猎获物，然后走进林场，开始了一天的伐木工作。
    这位业余狩猎者的名字叫吕世勤，是伊春林区丰林局第八林场的伐木工人。每天清晨，当人们还在酣睡时，他总是带着猎枪、弹药，第一个来到了森林。这时，机灵狡猾的灰鼠子成群结队的从松树洞里出来，爬到树上寻找松果。吕世勤趁这个机会，施展出他的绝妙枪技，瞄准灰鼠子，几乎一枪一个，灰鼠子就像“点名”似的个个应声而下。中午，当大家回去吃饭时，他抢忙吃完自带的干粮，又继续抽空钻到树林里去打猎。晚上收工了，他提着猎物，背着猎枪，带着胜利的微笑走回家去，说不定在归途中还会增加一些战绩。
    就这样，这位业余狩猎爱好者，利用业余时间和星期日，最近两个月来共猎获了二百多只灰鼠子，为国家生产了二百多张珍贵的灰皮。因此，他被誉为伊春林区业余“狩猎能手”。
    仅仅在几个月以前，他还对狩猎这行一窍不通。当伊春林区开展群众性的狩猎生产时，他干劲十足地投入了这个生产高潮。开始因为摸不着窍，费了不少冤枉力。有时背着枪在树林里转半天，累得腰酸腿痛，才打到两只灰鼠子，一看别人不大一会就打中了十几只。
    “这是怎么回事儿呢？”他寻思着：“苦干还得巧干，不掌握灰鼠子的习性和生活规律，满山跑还是不行的。”每天业余时间，他就悄悄地跑到树林里，蹲在松树下观察，经过一段时间，他发现：每天黎明，成群的灰鼠子总是从老家——臭松林跑到果松林去寻找松籽吃；一到中午，灰鼠又在向阳的松树上玩乐，经过多次的细心观察，他慢慢摸到了灰鼠的活动规律以后，即使灰鼠子再狡猾、机灵，也逃不脱这位业余狩猎能手的手掌了。
