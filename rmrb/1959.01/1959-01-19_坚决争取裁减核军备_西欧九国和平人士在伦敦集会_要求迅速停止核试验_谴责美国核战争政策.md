Xinhua News Agency Report: The "European Conference for Nuclear Disarmament" officially opened in London on the 17th. Two hundred and fifty delegates from nine Western European countries are participating in the conference. This is the first major conference held by organizations and individuals in Western Europe engaged in the anti-nuclear arms race movement. The National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy from the United States sent observers to the conference.

Canon Collins, chairman of the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said, "I think it is particularly appropriate that the first conference of European anti-nuclear weapons organizations and individuals is being held in London, because London is the capital of the only European country with the dubious honor of belonging to the 'nuclear club'. I am particularly pleased that France and West Germany have sent strong delegations here to participate in the meeting, because their governments are still knocking on the 'club' door."

The famous British philosopher Bertrand Russell, in his opening address to the conference, said that this conference is an encouragement to all who hope to avoid nuclear disaster.

He emphasized, "The most practical issue at present is to stop nuclear testing."

Russell called on Britain to abandon the hydrogen bomb. He then put forward other measures that he believes would reduce the risk of nuclear war and reduce the economic burden of armaments, including strengthening cultural contacts between East and West, easing international tensions, and so on.

The conference called on the major powers to reach an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons tests as soon as possible. The conference decided to write to British Prime Minister Macmillan to protest the British government's decision to build a nuclear weapons base near Dortmund in West Germany; and called on Western European countries to hold demonstrations to support the German people's struggle against the establishment of nuclear armaments and rocket bases.

The conference adopted a suggestion made by the British delegation: to designate August 6, the day the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, as World Anti-Atomic Bomb Day.

The conference decided to send a telegram to the conference on the discontinuance of nuclear weapons testing being held in Geneva; requesting the conference to "promptly obtain results sufficient to put a worried world at ease."

The conference also adopted a proposal to prepare for a more extensive world conference for nuclear disarmament to be held this autumn, which will invite representatives from socialist countries to participate. British playwright Ben Levy, in proposing this, said that this world conference should include representatives from Asian, African and Australian countries.

The conference also decided to establish a European Committee Against Nuclear Armaments, which has the power to coordinate various nuclear disarmament activities, including organizing a world conference for nuclear disarmament. It was announced that representatives of American anti-nuclear armaments organizations will participate in the aforementioned committee in an advisory capacity.

One after another, the delegates spoke about the increasing danger brought about by the development of weapons of mass destruction, and they each attacked the nuclear war policies of their own governments. British writer J.B. Priestley pointed out to the conference that this policy was imposed on them without their consent.

Many delegates specifically condemned the US nuclear war policy, including the recent US attempt to overturn the decisions made by scientists at the Geneva conference on stopping nuclear tests.

All the delegates spoke of the rising tide of anti-nuclear weapons movements in their countries.

Among the delegates present were many scientists. British medical scientist Professor Rotblat stressed that scientists cannot evade the responsibility they should bear for the current dangerous situation caused by the nuclear arms race. He said that more and more scientists are recognizing their responsibility and are convinced that they can make a beneficial contribution to international peace.

The conference is scheduled to end on the afternoon of the 18th. At that time, it is planned that seventy delegates will travel by special plane to Frankfurt to participate in a mass rally against nuclear war.

This conference was originally scheduled to be held in Basel, Switzerland, last July, but the Swiss government prohibited the conference from being held in Switzerland.

    坚决争取裁减核军备
    西欧九国和平人士在伦敦集会
    要求迅速停止核试验　谴责美国核战争政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：“欧洲争取裁减核军备大会”17日正式在伦敦开幕。参加这个大会的有来自西欧九个国家的二百五十名代表。这是西欧从事反对核武器竞赛运动的组织和个人第一次举行的大会。美国争取采取稳健的核政策全国委员会派了观察员参加大会。
    英国争取裁减核武器运动主席柯林斯说，“我认为，欧洲反对核武器的组织和个人的第一次大会在伦敦召开是特别正确的，因为伦敦是具有参加‘核俱乐部’这个可疑的荣誉的唯一的欧洲国家的首都。我特别高兴，法国和西德派出了强大的代表团到这里参加会议，因为它们的政府甚至现在还在敲‘俱乐部’的大门。”
    英国著名哲学家罗素在向大会致开幕词时说，这次大会是对一切希望避免核灾难的人的鼓励。
    他强调说，“当前最实际的问题是停止进行核试验。”
    罗素要求英国放弃氢弹。他接着提出了其他一些他认为会减少核战争的危险和减少军备的经济负担的措施，包括加强东西方的文化接触、缓和国际紧张局势等等。
    大会要求大国迅速就停止核武器试验达成协议。大会决定写信给英国首相麦克米伦，抗议英国政府决定在西德的多特蒙德附近建立核武器基地；并号召西欧各国举行示威来支持德国人民为反对建立核军备和火箭基地而进行的斗争。
    大会通过了英国代表提出的这项建议：把8月6日美国向广岛投掷第一颗原子弹的日子定为世界反对原子爆炸日。
    大会决定打电报给在日内瓦召开的不继续试验核武器会议；要求会议“迅速获得足以使焦虑的世界松一口气的结果”。
    大会还通过了一项关于准备在今年秋天组织一次规模更加广泛的争取裁减核军备世界大会的建议，这次大会将邀请社会主义国家的代表参加。英国戏剧家本·李维在提出这项建议时说，这次世界大会应当包括亚洲、非洲和澳洲国家的代表。
    大会还决定成立欧洲反对核军备委员会，这个委员会有权使各种争取裁减核军备的活动互相配合，包括组织争取裁减核军备世界大会。据宣布，美国的反对核军备组织的代表将以顾问资格参加上述委员会。
    代表们一个接一个地谈到了发展大规模毁灭性武器所带来的越来越大的危险，他们各自抨击了本国政府的核战争政策。英国作家普里斯特利向大会指出，这种政策是在没有征得人们的同意的情况之下就强加在他们身上的。
    许多代表特别谴责了美国的核战争政策，包括美国最近企图取消科学家们在日内瓦会议上就停止核试验所作出的决定的作法。
    所有的代表们都谈到，在他们的国家中，反对核武器运动日益高涨。
    在到会的代表中有许多科学家。英国医学科学家罗特布拉特教授强调指出，科学家们不能规避对目前由于核军备竞赛而造成的危险局势所应担负的责任。他说，既认识到自己负有责任，又深信他们能够对国际和平作出有益的贡献的科学家已经越来越多了。
    大会预定在18日下午结束。那时计划将有七十名代表将乘专机去法兰克福参加反对核战争的群众集会。
    这次大会原定于去年7月在瑞士的巴塞尔举行，可是瑞士政府禁止大会在瑞士举行。
