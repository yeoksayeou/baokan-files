    We advocate abolishing the unreasonable patriarchal system that has been left over from history and developing a democratic and united family life. This proposition has been warmly welcomed by the masses. Therefore, in terms of housing construction, attention must be paid to making houses suitable for the reunion of men, women, old and young in each family.
