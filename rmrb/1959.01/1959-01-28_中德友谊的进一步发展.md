    Further Development of Sino-German Friendship
    The friendly visit to our country by the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, is about to conclude. The visit by the distinguished guests has further enhanced the fraternal friendly cooperation between China and Germany and made a significant contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp and maintaining world peace.
    During the visit of the distinguished guests from the German Democratic Republic to our country, representatives of the Chinese and German governments held talks and reached a complete consensus on the current international situation and issues related to the relations between the two countries. The talks between China and Germany were held under the following circumstances: on the one hand, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become unprecedentedly strong, the unity of socialist countries is constantly strengthening, and the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also moving towards new upsurges; on the other hand, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, in order to alleviate its economic crisis and internal contradictions, is still hindering the relaxation of international tensions and continuing to implement aggressive policies of preparing for war and expanding outwards. On the entire international stage, the forces of peace and war, the forces of national independence and national oppression, and the forces of progress and reaction are engaging in fierce struggles under new conditions. As the joint statement of the Chinese and German governments unanimously believes: since the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country at the end of 1955, the balance of world power has undergone tremendous changes in favor of peace and socialism.
    The growth and development of socialist forces is the main trend of the world situation. In recent years, the economies of the socialist camp countries have flourished, science and technology have developed rapidly, the socialist and communist consciousness of the people has greatly improved, and peaceful diplomatic policies have also achieved significant victories. On the common basis of Marxist-Leninist principles, the relations of friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist camp countries are constantly consolidating and developing. All this has made the socialist camp a decisive factor in the international situation. In particular, the successful launch of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket and the grand goals of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, which are being discussed at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, further demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and greatly inspire and enhance the confidence of the people of the world in maintaining world peace and striving for a better future. The people of China and Germany are well aware that the increasing strength of the socialist camp is an important guarantee for our continuous victories. Therefore, the representatives of the two countries reiterated in the joint statement that they will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen the strength and unity of the socialist camp and continue to wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionism, which attempts to endanger the unity of proletarian internationalism and the international workers' movement.
    As loyal friends of the people of oppressed countries, the Chinese and German governments expressed their firm support in the statement for the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence. Today, whether in the Eastern or Western Hemisphere, the flames of this struggle are burning more and more fiercely. The Cuban people have overthrown the Batista dictatorship and continue to launch a struggle against interference in internal affairs by US imperialism; the mass struggle of the Congolese people for freedom and independence is developing vigorously. The increasingly high tide of national liberation movements is shaking the foundations of imperialist colonial rule. Socialist countries and oppressed nations have common interests in the struggle against imperialism. We have always expressed sympathy for national liberation movements and given them active support. We firmly believe that no matter what means imperialism adopts—whether it be intimidation, deception, division, suppression, or armed intervention—it cannot save itself from its inevitable demise. As long as they unite and persevere in their struggle, the national liberation movements in Cuba, the Congo, and all oppressed countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with the support of the world's forces of peace and progress, will surely achieve final victory.
    At the time of the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country, the unresolved German question is once again attracting worldwide attention. The representatives of the Chinese and German governments unanimously agreed in the talks that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of great significance for world peace. Because the US aggressive bloc and the ruling authorities in West Germany have taken advantage of the division of Germany and the absence of a peace treaty with Germany to revive militarism and prepare for a new war, European security and world peace are still seriously threatened, and the German people's desire for the peaceful reunification of Germany has not been realized. In order to change this extremely abnormal situation, which is harmful to the international situation and the interests of the German people, the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic have made significant efforts over the years. Recently, the Soviet government has put forward proposals on making West Berlin a demilitarized free city and on discussing and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic has declared its support for the Soviet proposals and reiterated its proposal for the establishment of a German confederation. These are reasonable proposals for a peaceful solution to the German question, taking into account the current reality in Germany. They are conducive to the realization of Germany's peaceful reunification and the relaxation of tensions in Europe, and are therefore valued and welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world. However, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, including the West German government, has still not shown sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question. They are eager to deny the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union and the government of the German Democratic Republic, but they cannot come up with practical and feasible proposals of their own. In order for the German question to be resolved on a peaceful and democratic basis, the German people and peace-loving people all over the world still need to carry out a persistent struggle. The government and people of our country have fully supported, are fully supporting, and will fully support in the future the Soviet government's proposal for a peaceful solution to the German question and the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to strive for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. In view of the fact that the imperialist bloc disregards reality and still harbors blatant hostility towards the German Democratic Republic, the government of the People's Republic of China emphasized in particular in the joint statement that "it will regard any attack by imperialist countries on the German Democratic Republic as an attack on the entire socialist camp and will fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such an attack." This fully expresses the firm will of the 650 million Chinese people to fully support the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic.
    In addition, in the joint statement, the representatives of the two governments also reiterated their support for the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals on convening summit conferences, universal disarmament, and the permanent prohibition of nuclear weapons, as well as the proposal of the People's Republic of Poland on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The two sides in the talks also expressed their full support for the struggle of the Vietnamese and Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherlands.
    The visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to China has made a significant contribution to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and Germany. Through consultations on current major international issues, explorations of the possibility of further developing our two countries' economic and cultural relations, and exchanges of experience in socialist construction, the friendly relations between our two fraternal countries have become even closer. The signing of the Sino-German consular treaty is another concrete step in strengthening the ties between our two countries. Loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, a high sense of responsibility for world peace and the cause of human progress, enable our two countries to work together, strengthen unity, support each other, and continuously advance our friendly cooperation.
    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic will soon conclude their visit to China satisfactorily. We sincerely congratulate the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic on achieving greater success in the struggle for German reunification, defending world peace, and building socialism! We wish the friendship between the people of China and Germany further consolidation and development!

### 中德友谊的进一步发展

    中德友谊的进一步发展
    以奥托·格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团对我国的友好访问就要结束了。贵宾们的这次访问，进一步增进了中德两国之间兄弟般的友好合作，并且对于加强社会主义阵营的团结一致和维护世界和平，作出了重大的贡献。
    在德意志民主共和国贵宾访问我国期间，中德两国政府代表进行了会谈，对于当前国际局势和有关两国关系问题取得了完全一致的看法。中德两国的会谈，是在这样的形势之下举行的：一方面，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量已经空前强大，社会主义各国的团结正在不断加强，同时亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动也走向新的高涨；另一方面，以美国为首的帝国主义集团为了缓和它们的经济危机和内部矛盾，还在阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，继续执行准备战争和对外扩张的侵略政策。在整个国际舞台上，和平和战争的力量，民族独立和民族压迫的力量，进步和反动的力量，正在新的条件下进行着剧烈的斗争。正像中德两国政府联合声明中所一致认为的：自从1955年底德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问我国以来，世界力量的对比发生了大大有利于和平和社会主义的变化。
    社会主义力量的壮大发展，是世界局势的主流。近年来，社会主义阵营各国的经济蓬勃高涨，科学技术迅速发展，人民的社会主义和共产主义觉悟有了很大的提高，和平外交政策也取得了重大的胜利。在马克思列宁主义原则的共同基础上，社会主义阵营各国友好团结和互助合作的关系不断巩固和发展。这一切，使社会主义阵营成了国际局势中的决定性因素。特别是苏联发射宇宙火箭的成功和正在苏共第二十一次代表大会讨论的苏联七年计划的宏伟目标，更加显示了社会主义制度的优越性，大大地鼓舞和增强了全世界人民维护世界和平和争取美好将来的胜利信心。中德两国人民深知，社会主义阵营的日益强大，是我们不断取得胜利的重要保证。因此两国代表在联合声明中再一次表示，今后将继续不倦地为加强社会主义阵营的力量和团结而努力，并继续同企图危害无产阶级国际主义团结和国际工人运动的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
    作为被压迫国家的人民的忠实朋友，中德两国政府在声明中对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，表示了坚决的支持。今天，无论在东半球还是西半球，这个斗争的烽火是愈燃愈炽了。古巴人民打倒了巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，继续展开了反对美帝国主义干涉内政的斗争；刚果人民争取自由和独立的群众斗争轰轰烈烈地发展着。日益高涨的民族解放运动，摇撼着帝国主义殖民统治的基础。在反对帝国主义斗争中社会主义国家同被压迫民族有着共同的利益。我们对民族解放运动一贯表示同情并给予积极的支持。我们深信，不管帝国主义采取什么手段——无论是恫吓、欺骗、分化、镇压和武装干涉，都挽救不了它们必然要死亡的命运。只要团结一致和坚持斗争，古巴、刚果以及所有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫国家的民族解放运动，在全世界和平和进步力量支持下，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    在德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问我国的时候，悬而未决的德国问题正再一次受到全世界的瞩目。中德两国政府代表在会谈中一致认为，缔结对德和约对于世界和平具有非常重大的意义。由于美国侵略集团和西德统治当局利用了德国分裂和没有签订对德和约的局面，复活军国主义和准备新战争，欧洲安全和世界和平仍然受到严重的威胁，而德意志人民要求和平统一德国的愿望也一直未能实现。为了改变这种极不正常的对国际局势和德国人民利益有害的情况，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府历年来已经作了重大的努力。最近苏联政府更提出了关于使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的建议和讨论与缔结对德和约的建议。德意志民主共和国政府已声明支持苏联的建议，并且重申关于建立德意志邦联的主张。这些都是在考虑到德国目前现实情况而提出来的和平解决德国问题的合理主张。它们有助于德国和平统一的实现和欧洲紧张局势的缓和，因而受到全世界爱好和平人民的重视和欢迎。但是以美国为首的帝国主义集团，包括西德政府在内，却仍然没有表现出和平解决德国问题的诚意。它们急于否定苏联和德意志民主共和国政府的合理建议，而自己又提不出切实可行的主张来。为了使德国问题能够在和平民主的基础上得到解决，德国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民还需要进行坚持不懈的斗争。我国政府和人民，过去、现在和将来都全力支持苏联政府关于和平解决德国问题的建议，支持德意志民主共和国为争取建立一个统一的爱好和平的和民主的德国所进行的努力。鉴于帝国主义集团无视现实，并且对德意志民主共和国仍然抱着露骨的敌对态度，中华人民共和国政府在联合声明中特别强调指出，“它将把帝国主义国家对德意志民主共和国的任何进攻都看作是对整个社会主义阵营的进攻，并且将全力支持德意志民主共和国击退这种进攻。”这充分表达了六亿五千万中国人民全力支持兄弟的德意志民主共和国人民的坚强意志。
    此外，在联合声明中，两国政府代表还重申了对苏联关于召开首脑会议、普遍裁军、永久禁止核武器等和平建议，以及波兰人民共和国关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议。对于越南和朝鲜人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争，会谈双方也表示了全力的支持。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团在中国的访问，对加强中德两国政府和人民之间的友谊合作，已作出了重大的贡献。通过对当前重大国际问题的磋商，对进一步发展我们两国经济文化关系的可能性的探讨，以及对社会主义建设经验的交流，我们两个兄弟国家之间的友好关系是更加紧密了。中德领事条约的签订，也是我们两国加强联系的又一具体步骤。对于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的矢忠不渝，对于世界和平和人类进步事业的崇高的责任感，使我们两国共同努力，加强团结，相互支援，把我们的友好合作不断地推向前进。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团就将圆满地结束他们在中国的访问了。我们衷心地祝贺兄弟般的德意志民主共和国人民在争取德国统一，保卫世界和平和建设社会主义的斗争中取得更大的成就！祝中德两国人民的友谊进一步巩固发展！
