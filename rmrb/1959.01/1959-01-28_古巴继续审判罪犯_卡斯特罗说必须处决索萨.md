    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 27th: The trial of Batista criminals in the Cuban capital continued on the afternoon of the 26th at the Havana Higher Military Court outside Camp Columbia. The Havana trials began on the 22nd. Later, the trials were suspended due to the illness of the defense lawyers for the other two criminals awaiting trial.
    On the afternoon of the 26th, the murderer Morejon, a former army officer of the reactionary government, was tried. According to reports, this criminal has been sentenced to death after trial. Morejon was one of the three major executioners under Batista. He had murdered two hundred farmers in Oriente Province and committed cruel crimes of theft and trampling on the people. One hundred people attended the trial of this murderer to testify, including General Cienfuegos, Chief of Staff of the Cuban Armed Forces.
    It is reported that Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro reiterated on the evening of the 25th that he would resolutely suppress those who have committed serious crimes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, January 27th: Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro said on the evening of the 25th that Sosa, a former lieutenant colonel in the dictatorial government's army, must be executed. This blood-debt-laden criminal, who murdered 108 people and burned more than 200 houses, was sentenced to death by the Havana court on the 23rd. According to reports, the murderer Sosa has appealed to a higher court against the Havana court's judgment.
    Castro said that Sosa "is the worst of the war criminals, and if he is not shot, then no one else can be executed."

    古巴继续审判罪犯
    卡斯特罗说必须处决索萨
    新华社27日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴首都审讯巴蒂斯塔罪犯的工作26日下午在哥伦比亚营外面的哈瓦那高级军事法庭继续进行。哈瓦那审讯罪犯的工作是在22日开始的。后来，审讯工作由于其他两个等待受审的罪犯的辩护律师生病而暂停举行。
    26日下午受到审讯的杀人罪犯是前反动政府陆军军官莫雷洪。消息说，这个罪犯经过审判以后已经被判处死刑。莫雷洪是巴蒂斯塔手下三个大刽子手之一，他曾经在奥连特省杀害了二百个农民，并且还犯有盗窃和蹂躏人民的残暴罪行。在审讯这个杀人罪犯时有一百人到场作证，其中包括古巴武装部队参谋长西恩富戈斯将军。
    据报道，古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗25日晚再次表示要坚决镇压那些犯有重大罪行的人。
    新华社27日讯　加拉加斯消息：古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在25日晚说，前独裁政府的陆军少校索萨必须被处决。这个血债累累的罪犯，因为谋杀过一百零八个人和焚烧过二百多间房屋曾在23日被哈瓦那法庭判处死刑。有消息说，杀人犯索萨对哈瓦那法庭的判决不服，已经向高一级的法庭提出了上诉。
    卡斯特罗说，索萨“是战犯中最坏的一个，如果不枪毙他，那末就没有其他人可以被处决了”。
