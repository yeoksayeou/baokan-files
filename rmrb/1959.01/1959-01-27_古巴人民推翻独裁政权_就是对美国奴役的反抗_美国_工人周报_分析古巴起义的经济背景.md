Xinhua News Agency, January 26th – During Batista's rule, the Cuban people suffered immensely from the brutal exploitation of American monopoly capital. A recent article in the U.S. "Workers' Weekly" titled "Economic Background of Cuban Uprising" argues that the Cuban people's overthrow of the Batista dictatorship is a revolt against the rule and exploitation of Wall Street imperialism. This shows that Batista's downfall is not only a great victory for the Cuban people against American imperialist political enslavement, but also against American imperialist economic enslavement.

Of the billion dollars of American investment in Cuba, half was invested during Batista's rule. Batista provided every convenience for American economic plunder. American monopoly capital controlled Cuba's major economic lifelines, including sugar production, electricity, public transportation, and underground mineral resources. American companies extended their tentacles into the interior and the coast, and many sugar companies also had affiliated banks, newspapers, radio stations, schools, and docks. American tycoon DuPont even established an airport in Cuba. According to materials listed in the financial reports of some companies, American companies stole high profits from Cuba every year, with the West Indies Sugar Company's profits reaching five times its investment.

The United States not only plundered Cuba's wealth through investment, but also turned Cuba into a raw material producing country mainly producing sugar, and made Cuba a dumping market for American goods. In describing the scene of American goods flooding the Cuban market, the aforementioned article in the U.S. "Workers' Weekly" wrote that the "Spanish" scarves used by Cuban middle-class women were imported from Manhattan (USA), and the cheese on the macaroni sold in restaurants was canned in Brooklyn (USA). The article said that even the toothpicks on the counters were made in the United States.

American economic plunder of the Cuban people was particularly ferocious during Batista's tenure. From 1952 to 1957, American companies plundered a huge profit of 750 million U.S. dollars from Cuba. During this period, 200 American companies infiltrated various economic sectors of Cuba. In the first half of last year, Batista offered the Moa cobalt mine concession to the United States, and in June of the same year, issued an order to lease certain underground resources of Cuba to American companies forever.

Millions of Cuban laborers lived like slaves under the strict control of American monopoly capital. According to Cuban trade union leaders, the worst off among the Cuban laborers were the hundreds of thousands of agricultural and industrial workers employed by American sugar factories and sugarcane plantation owners. Rojas, the general secretary of the Cuban National Sugar Workers' Union, once said in an article that every American sugar company in Cuba "has its own police. Any worker who dares to protest will be imprisoned and whipped." "All managers and technicians are North Americans, and they treat Cuban workers like dogs." Another Cuban trade union leader, Cundero, also pointed out that what makes the fate of these workers particularly tragic is that they only have work during the sugarcane harvesting season, which lasts no more than three to five months each year. Apart from this period, the workers have no choice but to buy what they and their families need on credit from the "company stores" controlled by the company. As a result, the amount of credit often exceeds all the wages that can be earned in the next harvest season, which makes Cuban workers become true slaves of American companies.

The living and housing conditions of the Cuban people are extremely harsh. A reporter who visited Cuba said that the people in the suburbs of the Cuban capital "live in squalid shacks with walls made of plywood and thin iron sheets, and roofs made of sugarcane and thatch." He said that a worker's daily wage is not enough to support himself, let alone his family. At the same time, according to Cuban newspapers, in this country with a population of just over six million, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the sugar, tobacco, textile, and other economic sectors has reached a quarter of the total population. Under the brutal plunder of American monopoly capital, Cuban laborers do not have enough food, and they do not have money to see a doctor when they get sick. It is said that, like some other countries in Latin America, the average life expectancy of Cubans is only over thirty years old.

    古巴人民推翻独裁政权  就是对美国奴役的反抗
    美国“工人周报”分析古巴起义的经济背景
    新华社26日讯　在巴蒂斯塔统治期间，古巴人民由于受到美国垄断资本的残酷剥削，生活极为悲惨。美国“工人周报”最近在一篇题为“古巴起义活动的经济背景”的文章中认为，古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，是对华尔街帝国主义的统治和剥削的反抗。这表明，巴蒂斯塔的垮台不但是古巴人民反对美帝国主义的政治奴役、而且也是反对美帝国主义经济奴役的一次巨大胜利。
    美国在古巴的十亿美元的投资中，有半数是在巴蒂斯塔统治期间投下的。巴蒂斯塔为美国的经济掠夺提供了一切便利条件。美国垄断资本控制了古巴的主要经济命脉，其中包括制糖、电力、公共交通运输和地下矿藏。美国公司把它的触角伸展到了内地和海边，许多糖业公司还附设了银行、报纸、广播电台、学校和码头。美国富豪杜邦甚至还在古巴设立有飞机场。根据某些公司在财政报告中所列举的材料，美国公司每年从古巴窃取了高额利润，其中西印度群岛糖公司的利润竟然达到了它的投资额的五倍。
    美国不但通过投资掠夺古巴的财富，并且把古巴变成以食糖为主的原料生产国，并且使古巴成为美国商品的倾销市场。美国“工人周报”的上述文章在描述美国货充斥古巴市场的情景时写道，古巴中产阶级妇女所用的“西班牙”围巾是从（美国）曼哈顿进口的，饭馆里出售的通心粉上面的干酪是在（美国）鲁克林装成罐头的，黄油是在（美国）威斯康星制造的。文章说，甚至在柜台上的牙签也是美国制造的。
    美国对古巴人民的经济掠夺在巴蒂斯塔执政期间特别凶恶。从1952年到1957年，美国公司就从古巴掠取了七亿五千万美元的巨额利润。在这期间，有二百家美国公司渗入了古巴的各个经济部门。去年上半年，巴蒂斯塔又把莫阿钴矿租让权奉送给美国，并且在同年6月间签发了一项把古巴某些地下资源永远出租给美国公司的命令。
    几百万古巴劳动人民在美国垄断资本的严密控制下，过着奴隶般的生活。据古巴的工会领袖揭露，在古巴劳动人民中，以美国糖厂和甘蔗种植园主雇用的几十万农业工人和产业工人的处境最为恶劣。古巴全国糖业工人联合会总书记罗查斯曾在一篇文章中说，在古巴的美国糖业公司每家“有自己的警察。任何敢于抗议的工人都要被监禁、鞭笞”，“所有的经理和技术人员都是北美人，他们把古巴工人当狗一样看待”。另一个古巴工会领袖昆德罗还指出，使这些工人的命运特别悲惨的是，他们每年只在为期不超过三至五个月的甘蔗收获季节里才有工作，除了这个时期以外，工人们不能不向公司操纵下的“公司商店”赊购他们自己和家庭所需要的东西。结果往往是赊购的款额超过了在下次收获季节里所可能获得的全部工资，这使得古巴工人变成了美国公司的真正奴隶。
    古巴人民的生活和居住条件极为恶劣，一个访问过古巴的记者说，古巴首都近郊的人民“住在用三夹板和薄铁片做墙、以甘蔗和茅草做屋顶的龌龊的棚户中”。他说，工人每日的工资不够养活他本人，更不用说到他的家庭了。同时，据古巴报纸报道，这个人口仅有六百多万的国家，在糖业、烟草、纺织和其他经济部门中失业和半失业的人数竟达到人口总数的四分之一。在美国垄断资本的残酷掠夺下，古巴劳动人民没有充足的食物，得了病也没有钱就医。有消息说，同拉丁美洲一些其他国家一样，古巴人的平均寿命只有三十多岁。
