Mobilize the Broad Masses of Workers and Staff to Study Science and Technology
Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant Establishes Mass Scientific and Technological Research Network

    (Our Dispatch) The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant has established a mass scientific and technological research network extending from the plant, to workshops, and even to work sections. This scientific and technological research network is composed of leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel under the unified leadership of the factory's Party committee.

    The Construction Machine Tool Plant established a Scientific and Technological Research Institute in July of last year. At that time, only one or two people from each workshop participated in research work, which fell far short of meeting the requirements of production development. Therefore, in October of last year, the factory's Party committee decided to take the original 600-plus scientific research personnel as the backbone to mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff in workshops and work sections to carry out scientific and technological research. Currently, the plant has established fifteen scientific and technological research institutes and more than seventy research groups. From July to December of last year, the plant successfully researched more than seven hundred scientific and technological projects in connection with key production problems, and these were quickly applied to production.

    The method used by each workshop to carry out scientific and technological research is to combine top-down efforts. General research projects are solved by groups; more significant research projects or those that groups cannot solve are researched and resolved by the research institutes; and projects that the research institutes cannot solve are brought to the factory's Scientific and Technological Research Institute, where experienced veteran workers, advanced producers, and engineering and technical personnel study and resolve them together.

    The development of scientific and technological research in the workshops of the Construction Machine Tool Plant has promoted the technical innovation movement throughout the plant and boosted production. The No. 31 Workshop of this plant launched scientific and technological research activities in October of last year and has been overfulfilling its production tasks ahead of schedule every month. In December of last year, the production tasks of this workshop were very tight, and the equipment was insufficient, making it seem difficult to complete the task of producing simplified wheel-making machines. The workshop's Party organization led the workers to engage in brainstorming, making the masses fully aware of the importance of completing the production tasks, while also tightly grasping the link of scientific and technological research. Targeting the weakness of insufficient equipment, the workers and technical personnel of this workshop vigorously engaged in scientific and technological research to design and manufacture indigenous machine tools, researching and making more than forty indigenous machine tools. In the past, the equipment section of this workshop relied on manual operation, but now 80% of the operations have been mechanized, and the task of producing simplified wheel-making machines has been overfulfilled.

    The development of scientific and technological research in the workshops has fully mobilized the positive factors in the workshops, brought into play the initiative and creativity of workers and technical personnel, and fully utilized the favorable conditions in the workshops to promptly apply the various research results to production. In the past, only a few people would study the rationalization proposals put forward by workers, with the research materials being solved by the factory, and the workers' rationalization proposals could not be quickly applied to production. Now, the workers' rationalization proposals are studied by the scientific and technological research group's researchers, the workers who put forward the proposals, veteran workers, and technicians. After collective discussion, they can find some scrap materials in the workshop and immediately start researching; after the experiment is successful, it can be immediately applied to production. In the two months since the establishment of scientific and technological research organizations in the workshops, the projects researched and implemented have reached more than six hundred and eighty due to the full mobilization of the masses. At the same time, because the research results can be quickly applied to production, the enthusiasm of workshop cadres in leading scientific and technological research has been greatly enhanced. Currently, when deploying production tasks, each workshop must deploy scientific research tasks based on the current key and weak links in production.

    Workers have further improved their scientific and technological level through scientific research. Wang Decan, a young lathe operator at this plant, found that when machining rolling bearings with a single-point tool, the machined surfaces could not be equally flat, resulting in a high scrap rate and low efficiency. To improve the output and quality of bearings, he studied scientific and technological books such as "Lathe Processing Technology" and "Mechanical Engineering," mastering a set of methods for installing multiple tools and multiple cutting edges. He modified the single-point tool into seven cutting tools for machining the outer ring of the rolling bearing, combining the seven processes into one, and the product quantity immediately soared from the original 70 to 80 pieces per day to more than 590 pieces, while also eliminating defective products. Wang Decan's research not only enriched the principles of multiple tools and multiple cutting edges, but also learned the design of fixtures and the various operating techniques of planing, drilling, milling, and fitting for making fixtures. At the same time, the workers producing the inner ring of the bearing also learned to master the operation of multiple tools and multiple cutting edges, improving production efficiency.

    发动广大职工研究科学技术
    重庆建设机床厂建立群众性科学技术研究网
    本报讯　重庆建设机床厂从厂部、车间到工段，建立了一套群众性的科学技术研究网。这套科学技术研究网是在工厂党委统一领导下，由领导干部、工人和技术人员组成的。
  建设机床厂去年7月成立科学技术研究院，当时每个车间只有一、二个人参加研究工作，远远不能满足生产发展的要求，因此，去年10月，工厂党委决定以原有六百多名科学研究人员为骨干，发动车间和工段广大职工进行科学技术研究。目前，全厂已设立十五个科学技术研究所，七十多个研究小组。从去年7月到12月，全厂结合生产关键问题研究成功的科学技术项目有七百多项，并且很快运用到生产上去。
    各车间进行科学技术研究的方法是上下结合。一般性的研究项目，由小组解决；较重大的研究项目或小组不能解决的项目，由研究所研究解决；研究所不能解决的项目，提到厂科学技术研究院，由技术水平较高、经验丰富的老工人、先进生产者和工程技术人员一起研究解决。
    建设机床厂车间开展科学技术研究，促进了全厂技术革新运动，推动了生产。这个厂的三十一车间，去年10月展开科学技术研究活动以后，月月提前超额完成生产任务。去年12月，这个车间的生产任务十分紧张，设备又不足，看来生产简易元车的任务很难完成。车间党组织一面领导职工务虚，使群众充分认识完成生产任务的重要性，一面紧紧抓住科学技术研究这一环。这个车间的工人和技术人员针对设备不足的薄弱环节，大搞设计和制造土机床的科学技术研究，前后研究和制成四十多台土机床。这个车间的装备段以前都是手工操作，现在已有80％的操作实行机械化，超额完成了生产简易元车的任务。
    车间进行科学技术研究，充分调动了车间的积极因素，发挥了工人和技术人员的主动性与创造性，充分利用车间的有利条件，及时把各项研究成果运用到生产上去。过去，工人提的合理化建议，只有少数人进行研究，研究材料由厂部解决，而且工人的合理化建议不能很快运用到生产上去。现在，工人的合理化建议由科学技术研究小组研究人员和提建议的工人、老工人、技术员共同研究。经过集体讨论，他们就可以在车间里找些废旧材料，马上动手作起研究来；试验成功后可以立即运用到生产中去。各车间成立科学技术研究组织两个多月以来，由于充分发动了群众，研究和实现的项目达到六百八十多项。同时，由于研究成果能很快运用到生产上，因此，大大提高了车间干部领导科学技术研究的积极性。目前，各车间在布置生产任务的时候，都要根据当前的生产关键与薄弱环节布置科学研究任务。
    工人们通过科学研究进一步提高了科学技术水平。这个厂的青年车工王德灿，发现用单刀车制滚动轴承时，车制的几个面不能一样平，报废率大，而且效率很低。为了提高轴承的产量和质量，他钻研了“车工工艺学”和“机工”等科学技术书籍，掌握了装置多刀多刃的一套方法。他把单刀改装为七把刀具车制滚动轴承的外圈，将七道工序合成一道，产品数量马上从原来日产七、八十件猛升到五百九十多件，并且消灭了废次品。王德灿的研究，不仅丰富了多刀多刃的原理，而且还学会了设计夹具和制作夹具的刨、钻、铣、钳等多种操作技术。同时生产轴承内圈的工人也学会了掌握多刀多刃的操作，提高了生产效率。
