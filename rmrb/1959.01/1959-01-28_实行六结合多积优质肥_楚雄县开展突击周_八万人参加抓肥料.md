    Implementing Six Combinations to Accumulate More High-Quality Fertilizer
    Chuxiong County Launches a Blitz Week with 80,000 People Participating in Fertilizer Collection
    (Our report) Chuxiong County in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, has accumulated a large amount of high-quality fertilizer such as farmyard manure and compost by adopting six major combinations. Currently, each mu of land for the spring crops has been fertilized with 15,000 jin, more than double the amount applied in the same period last year. The people of the county are now striving to apply 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.
    The six major combinations for accumulating fertilizer in Chuxiong County are: First, combining specialized teams with blitz efforts. Currently, Chuxiong County is carrying out a blitz fertilizer accumulation campaign week with 80,000 people participating, with the goal of accumulating 1.4 billion jin of fertilizer before the Spring Festival. Each commune has specialized teams for accumulating farm manure and manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers. In the Mouding District, 20% of the labor force is dedicated to accumulating and producing fertilizer, producing more than 10,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer every day. The amount of fertilizer applied to spring crops has reached 20,000 jin per mu, compared to only 80 jin last year, and the quality is also better than last year. Second, combining on-site fertilizer accumulation with on-site fertilizer application. Chuxiong is mostly mountainous, and the land is far from the villages. In the past, transportation back and forth wasted a lot of labor. Now, communes are building manure ponds by the fields or moving cattle and pig pens to the fields. The Shuangbai District alone has built 4,000 field-side manure ponds, accumulating a large amount of good fertilizer, which has transformed 60% of the backward fields. Third, combining the accumulation of coarse fertilizer with the production of indigenous chemical fertilizer. Currently, the county's 25 communes have more than 3,700 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants, which have produced more than 800 million jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer, averaging more than 80 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer per mu. In addition, some communes have also established antibiotic factories and granular fertilizer factories. Fourth, combining frost prevention with smoke fertilization. Chuxiong has a cold climate, with 120 days of frost throughout the year. To protect the spring crops from frost damage, more than 40,000 frost prevention kilns have been built throughout the county. The frost prevention kilns also provide smoke fertilization, and one kiln can smoke-fertilize 3,000 jin per year, while also playing a role in killing insects. Fifth, combining grazing with fertilizer accumulation. The county has 200,000 cattle. In the past, cattle manure was mostly discarded on the mountains. This year, this animal manure is being collected as much as possible. One strong ox can accumulate 30,000 jin of fertilizer per month. Finally, combining sanitation work with fertilizer accumulation. In areas where Yi, Han, Hui, Miao, and other ethnic groups live, the gray soil on the walls is often scraped off to accumulate fertilizer, and the sludge in the street ditches is also cleaned up, accumulating fertilizer and promoting hygiene.

    实行六结合多积优质肥
    楚雄县开展突击周　八万人参加抓肥料
    本报讯　云南楚雄彝族自治州的楚雄县，采取六大结合的方法积了大量的厩肥堆肥等优质肥料。现在小春作物每亩已施肥一万五千斤，比去年同期多施一倍多，全县人民正为每亩施肥五万斤而努力。
    楚雄县六大结合的积肥方法是：第一、专业队和突击相结合。现在楚雄县正在开展八万人参加的突击积肥运动周，计划在春节前将积肥十四亿斤。积农家肥和制造土化肥各公社都有专业队。牟定区有20％的劳力专门积肥造肥，每天生产土化肥一万多斤，小春作物施肥量达到每亩两万斤，而去年只有八十斤，质量也比去年好。第二、把就地积肥和就地用肥相结合。楚雄多山，土地离村庄很远。过去往返运送浪费劳力很大，现在各公社都在田边修了粪塘或者把牛厩猪舍搬到田里去。仅双柏区就建立了四千个田边粪塘，积了大量好肥料，使60％的落后田变了样。第三、积粗肥和制土化肥相结合。现在全县二十五个公社，有土化肥厂三千七百多个，已制土化肥八亿多斤，平均每亩有土化肥八十多斤；此外，有的公社还建立了抗生菌厂，颗粒肥料等厂。第四、防霜和熏肥相结合。楚雄气候寒冷，全年有一百二十天霜期，为了保护小春作物免遭霜打，全县建立了四万多个防霜窑。防霜窑同时熏肥，一年一座窑可熏肥三千斤，同时还起了杀虫的作用。第五、放牧和积肥结合。全县有牛二十万头，过去牛粪多被抛在山上，今年把这些畜粪尽量拾回来。一条壮牛每月可积肥三万斤。最后、把卫生工作和积肥结合起来。在彝、汉、回、苗等民族聚居的地方，多把墙壁的灰土刮掉一层来积肥，街道阴沟的污泥，也打扫得干干净净，积了肥，又讲了卫生。　（陈勇进）
