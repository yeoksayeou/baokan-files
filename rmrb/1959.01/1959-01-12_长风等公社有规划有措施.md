According to a report in the Hubei Daily, communes in Hubei are taking practical actions to respond to the Ten Initiatives. All the cadres and members of the Changfeng People's Commune in Xiaogan, where national agricultural labor model Guan Musheng works, enthusiastically discussed and responded to the Ten Initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, revised the commune's agricultural production plan for this year, and will also run industries on a large scale and actively develop diversified operations. Currently, they are focusing on field management of summer harvest crops.

In order to realize this year's plan, the commune party committee has taken specific measures. In agriculture: First, they demanded the complete elimination of waterlogging and drought disasters this year, and the construction of three large, long canals to achieve self-flowing irrigation and drainage. Second, based on last year's experience, they determined to accumulate 160 million dan of fertilizer this year, with an average application of 1,000 jin of soil fertilizer and 2,000 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer per mu. Third, all 86,000 mu of land in the commune will be deeply ploughed to a depth of one to two chi or more using tractors, explosives, gang plows, and other methods. Fourth, further promote close planting. Fifth, all crops will be of improved varieties, and seed breeding farms will be established to specialize in breeding improved varieties. Sixth, eliminate various crop diseases and insect pests, carry out thorough winter "three-light" pest elimination campaigns, and produce large quantities of local pesticides, with each team running a local pesticide factory. Seventh, strive to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of harvesting, threshing, transportation, processing, and other tasks. Eighth, strengthen field management to achieve garden-style cultivation and universally implement the field management responsibility system. Specialized teams have been established for industrial and diversified operations production, and necessary leading cadres have been assigned.

Now, under the slogan of "Strengthening field management of summer harvest crops to ensure a good start for the greater leap forward in 1959," the vast number of cadres and members, over 7,000 people have been put into field management, accounting for 40% of the total labor force. 95% of the summer harvest crops have been top-dressed one to three times, ensuring full and strong seedlings, deep and unobstructed ditches, and weed-free fields.

The Pangong People's Commune in Xiangfan City was invigorated after studying the "Ten Initiatives."

In order to realize the initiatives, the commune, based on its specific circumstances, has made detailed plans for agriculture, industry, commerce, and diversified operations in 1959, and formulated specific measures to increase production. In agriculture, in addition to resolutely implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," specific requirements were put forward for the winter management of minor spring crops. Vigorously develop diversified operations and set up fixed professional teams. In terms of winter sideline occupations, develop 100 kinds of sideline production. Gradually realize the industrialization of the commune and vigorously carry out technological innovation.

The Ten Initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units have promoted the Wuyi Commune in Yichang County to carry out various crop field management and actively carry out deep plowing for large-scale high-yield early rice in 1959. The whole commune has organized 60% of the labor force to vigorously carry out the cultivation and management of various crops, and fiercely attack second and third-class seedlings.

    长风等公社有规划有措施
    据湖北日报消息　湖北一些公社纷纷用实际行动响应十大倡议。全国农业劳动模范官木生所在的孝感长风人民公社的全体干部和社员们，热烈讨论和响应全国农业先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议，重新修改了全社今年农业生产规划，还要大办工业，积极开展多种经营。目前正在大抓夏收作物田间管理。
    为了实现今年规划，公社党委采取了具体措施。在农业上，一、要求今年彻底消灭水旱灾害，兴修三条大长渠，做到排灌自流化。二、根据去年经验，确定今年积肥一亿六千万担，每亩平均施土化肥一千斤、杂肥二千担。三、全社八万六千亩田地分别用拖拉机、爆炸、套犁等办法，深翻一尺到二尺以上。四、进一步推行密植。五、全部作物实现良种化，并建立种子繁育场，专门繁育良种。六、消灭各种农作物病虫害，深入开展冬季三光除虫运动，大量制造土农药，队队办土农药厂。七、力争实现收割、脱粒、运输、加工等活路机械化和半机械化。八、加强田间管理，实现园田化，普遍推行田间管理责任制。在工业和多种经营生产上，都成立了专管班子，配备了必要的领导干部。
    现在，广大干部和社员在“加强夏收作物田间管理，保证打响1959年更大跃进第一炮”的口号下，已有七千多人投入了田间管理，占整个劳力40％。95％的夏收作物追了一次到三次肥，作到了全苗壮苗、沟深缺通、田间无草。
    襄樊市庞公人民公社学习了“十大倡议”后，人人振奋。
    公社为了实现倡议，根据本社具体情况，将1959年农业、工业、商业以及多种经营都作了细致规划，制订了具体增产措施。在农业上除坚决贯彻执行“八字宪法”外，并对小春作物的越冬管理提出具体要求。大搞多种经营，成立固定专业班子。在冬季副业方面，开展一百种副业生产。逐步实现公社工业化，大力进行技术革新。
    全国农业先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议，推动着宜昌县五一公社大搞各种作物田间管理，并为1959年早稻大面积高产积极进行深翻。全社已组织60％的劳力大搞各种作物的培育管理，猛攻二、三类苗。
