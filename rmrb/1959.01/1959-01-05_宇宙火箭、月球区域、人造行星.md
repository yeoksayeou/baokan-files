Explanation of Terms:

    Space Rocket
    A rocket is a tool that uses the principle of jet propulsion, like a firecracker, and can fly in a vacuum. A single-stage rocket can only reach a certain speed; if several rockets are connected in series, and they are activated one after another, the final stage rocket can reach extremely high speeds, even escape the Earth and fly to other planets. This multi-stage rocket is also called a space rocket.
    
    First, Second, and Third Cosmic Velocities
    From physics, we know that if an object is launched from the ground at any speed, and there is no influence of Earth's gravity, it will fly straight along the direction of launch. However, due to the influence of Earth's gravity, its orbit will become a curve. According to calculations, we can know that the faster the launch speed, the straighter the object's path in the air. If the launch speed parallel to the ground reaches 7.9 kilometers per second, the object can rotate around the Earth without falling to the ground. We call this speed the first cosmic velocity, also known as orbital velocity.
    
    If an object has a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, it can overcome the Earth's gravitational force, fly out of the Earth, and go to other planets in the solar system (such as the Moon, Venus, Mars, etc.). This speed is called the second cosmic velocity, also known as escape velocity. The space rocket launched by the Soviet Union is currently using this speed to escape the Earth's gravitational range and fly towards the Moon.
    
    When an object has a greater speed, reaching 16.7 kilometers per second, it can not only escape the Earth, but also escape the entire solar system and fly to other stars. This speed is called the third cosmic velocity.
    
    Lunar Region
    Every celestial body in the universe has a gravitational field around it. The magnitude of the gravitational force at each point in the gravitational field is directly proportional to the mass of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between that point and the celestial body. Both the Moon and the Earth have gravitational fields around them. Between the Moon and the Earth, there is a point where the Moon's gravity and the Earth's gravity are exactly balanced, that is, the magnitudes of these two forces are equal and their directions are opposite. This point is called the "gravity neutralization" point. Past the "gravity neutralization" point, closer to the Moon, the Moon's gravity is greater than the Earth's gravity. The lunar region we are talking about refers to the region where the Moon's gravity is greater than the Earth's gravity.
    
    Lunar Magnetic Field
    The Earth is like a large magnet; if a small compass needle is placed around it, it will be affected by it and point in a certain direction. We call this space with magnetic force a magnetic field. It is estimated that the Moon should also have a magnetic field similar to that of the Earth (yet to be explored), called the lunar magnetic field.
    
    Lunar Radioactivity
    Like radioactive elements on Earth such as radium and uranium, they will naturally decay and emit radiation. Whether the Moon also has this type of radioactive substance remains to be explored. If the Moon also has this radioactive element, the degree of its radioactivity also needs to be explored.
    
    Gaseous Composition of Interplanetary Matter
    In between the planets of the solar system, it is not an absolute vacuum; there are interstellar dust, molecules, individual atoms, and electrons, etc. These substances are called interplanetary gaseous matter. According to observations, their composition includes atoms of calcium, iron, sodium, and titanium, etc. The density of these interstellar substances is very sparse, averaging only one hundred millionth of the density of water.
    
    Solar Particle Radiation
    The sun is a hot gaseous planet with a surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees. A large amount of material is ejected from the sun's surface. Solar particles refer to various particles emitted from the sun into space, such as electrons, protons (hydrogen nuclei), and ions of other elements.
    
    Meteor Particles
    There are many tiny particles within the solar system, called meteor particles; most can be said to be formed by the fragmentation of comets. The bright light we see flashing across the night sky is formed by these particle materials rubbing against the Earth's atmosphere.
    
    Artificial Comet
    Comets are commonly known as brooms stars. They are celestial bodies within the solar system that orbit the sun in a certain path. Comets are divided into two parts: the head and the tail. Its shape is very special, with a long gas tail. These gases are formed by the head being heated and evaporated by sunlight, and at the same time being pushed backward by the pressure of sunlight.
    
    This time, the Soviet Union's launched space rocket contains an automatic device and can emit a luminous gas called sodium vapor cloud at a predetermined time. These clouds also form a comet-like shape with long tails when they are first released. Therefore, it is called an artificial comet.
    
    Artificial Solar Satellite or Artificial Planet
    If the speed of the rocket launched from Earth to the Moon is relatively fast, when this rocket approaches the Moon, its speed is greater than the Moon's escape velocity (the Moon's escape velocity is 2.34 kilometers per second), so it can escape the Moon's range. However, at this time, the speed has not yet reached the speed to escape the solar system (30 kilometers per second), so it can be attracted by the sun's gravity and become a satellite orbiting the sun—that is, an artificial planet.
    
    Orbital Elements
    The data used to determine the orbit of a celestial body (artificial satellites and space rockets are also celestial bodies) are called orbital elements. There are generally six data, which respectively represent the shape and size of the orbit, the position of the orbital plane in space, the direction of the orbit, and the position of the celestial body on the orbit at a certain moment.
    
    Motion Parameters
    Reference data used to understand the movement of celestial bodies in the sky and help calculate orbital elements.
    
    Virgo Constellation
    In ancient times, people used their rich imagination to regard the stars in the sky as various shapes of people, objects, birds, and beasts, etc. This is the origin of the names of constellations. Now, there are a total of eighty-eight constellations in common international use. The shapes, ranges, and sizes of each constellation are different, and the number of stars contained is also very inconsistent. The Virgo constellation is one of the constellations.
    
    Spica (Alpha Virginis)
    The brightest star in a constellation often has its own exclusive name. The brightest star in the Virgo constellation is called Spica. In ancient China, the sky was divided into three enclosures and twenty-eight mansions, and part of the Virgo constellation belonged to the Horn Mansion.
    
    Arcturus (Alpha Boötis)
    Is the brightest star in the Boötes constellation, its exclusive name is Arcturus, also called Boötis Alpha.
    
    Zubeneschamali (Beta Librae)
    Is the brightest star in the Libra constellation, it belongs to one of the twenty-eight mansions, the Di Mansion, its exclusive name is Di Alpha; it is also called Libra Beta. Now, every morning around 6 o'clock, in the sky due south of Beijing, about forty degrees above the ground, the bright star on the west side is Spica, and the star on the east side is Zubeneschamali (the star further east is Jupiter), and at this time, Arcturus is near the zenith, very bright. These three stars are easily visible, forming a large triangle.

### 宇宙火箭、月球区域、人造行星……

专栏：名词解释

    宇宙火箭、月球区域、人造行星……
    宇宙火箭
    火箭是一种像爆竹那样利用喷气推进原理的工具，它可以在真空中飞行。单级的火箭只能达到一定的速度；如果把几个火箭串联在一起，让它们一个接着一个陆续发动，最后的一级火箭就可以达到极高的速度，甚至脱离地球而飞向其他星球。这种多级火箭也叫做宇宙火箭。
    第一、第二、第三宇宙速度
    从物理学上知道，在地面上以任何速度发射一个物体，如果没有地心引力影响的话，它就会顺着发射的方向一直飞去，但是由于受到地心引力的影响，它的轨道就会成为一种曲线。根据计算，我们可以知道，发射的速度越快，物体在空中的路线就越平直。如果平行于地面的发射速度达到每秒七点九公里，物体就可以绕着地球旋转而不降落到地面。我们把这速度称为第一宇宙速度，也叫环绕速度。
    如果物体具有每秒十一点二公里的速度时，就可以克服地球引力的作用，飞出地球之外，到太阳系的其他星球（像月亮、金星、火星等）上去。这速度称为第二宇宙速度，也叫脱离速度。目前苏联发射的宇宙火箭正是以这样的速度而脱离地球引力范围飞向月球的。
    当物体具有更大的速度，达到每秒十六点七公里时，它不但能脱离地球，还能脱离整个太阳系，飞到别的恒星上去。这个速度称为第三宇宙速度。
    月球区域
    宇宙间每个天体的周围都有一个引力场。引力场中每一点引力的大小，同天体的质量成正比，同该点与天体间的距离的平方成反比。月球和地球的周围都有引力场。在月球和地球之间有一个点，在这点上，月球的引力和地球的引力正好相平衡，就是说，这两个引力的大小相等，方向相反。这个点叫“引力中和”点。过了“引力中和”点，再靠近月亮，所受月亮的引力就大于地球的引力。我们所说的月球区域，就是指在这个区域内月球的引力要大于地球的引力。
    月球磁场
    地球像一块大磁体；把一个小磁针放在它的周围就会受到它的作用而指向一定的方位。我们把这样的有磁力作用的空间叫做磁场。据估计，月球应该也要具有与地球相类似的磁场（还有待探查），称为月球磁场。
    月球的放射性
    像地球上的放射性如镭、铀等元素，会自然蜕变后放出放射线。而月球上是否也具有这种放射性的物质存在，则有待探查。如果月球上也具有这种放射性元素，其放射程度怎样，也需要加以探查。
    行星际物质的气体成份
    在太阳系各颗行星中间，并不是绝对的真空，其中有着星际灰尘、分子、单个的原子和电子等等。这些物质称为行星际的气体物质。它们的成份根据观测到的约有：钙、铁、钠和钛的原子等。这些星际物质的密度都很稀疏，平均只有水的密度的一百万万万万万分之一。
    太阳微粒辐射
    太阳是个炽热的气体星球，其表面温度约六千度。从太阳表面上有大量物质喷发出来。太阳微粒是指从太阳向宇宙空间发出的各种粒子，如电子、质子（氢原子核）和其他元素的离子等。流星粒子
    太阳系内有很多微小粒子，叫做流星粒子；大部分可以说是彗星破碎而成的。我们夜间看见的飞跃而过的亮光，就是这些粒子物质和地球大气摩擦而成的。
    人造彗星
    彗星俗名扫帚星。它是太阳系里面的天体，也按一定轨道绕太阳运行。彗星分头部和尾部两部分，它的形状很特别，有着很长的气体尾巴。这些气体是由头部受到太阳光晒热蒸发，而同时受太阳光的压力推向后边形成的。
    这一次苏联发射的宇宙火箭里面有自动装置并能在预定时间发出一种会发亮的气体，叫做钠蒸气云的，这些云在刚放出来的时候，也形成彗星似的形状，有长的尾巴。所以称为人造彗星。
    人造太阳卫星或人造行星
    如果从地球上发射到月球上去的火箭速度比较快，当这火箭接近月亮附近的时候，它的速度比月亮的脱离速度（月亮的脱离速度是每秒二点三四公里）来得大些，因此能够逸出月亮的范围。但是，这时候的速度尚没有达到脱离太阳系的速度（每秒三十公里），因此能够被太阳引力所吸引而成为绕太阳旋转的卫星——也就是人造行星。
    轨道要素
    用来决定天体（人造卫星及宇宙火箭也是天体之一）的运行轨道所用的数据，叫做轨道要素。一般有六个数据，它们分别表示轨道的形状，大小，轨道面在空间的位置，轨道的方向，以及天体某一时刻在轨道上的位置。
    运动参数
    了解天体在天空运动情况，帮助计算轨道要素所用的参考数据。
    室女星座
    古代人们凭着丰富的想像力，把满天繁星看成是各种形状的人、物、鸟、兽等，这就是星座名称的来源。现在国际通用的共有八十八个星座，各个星座的形状、范围大小各不相同，所包含的星数也很不一致。室女星座是星座中的一个。
    角宿一
    一个星座中的最亮星往往有它的专有名称。室女星座中的最亮星叫角宿一。我国古代把天空分成三垣二十八宿，室女星座的一部分是属于角宿的。
    牧夫一
    是牧夫星座中的最亮星，它的专有名称是大角，也有叫它做牧夫一的。
    天秤一
    是天秤星座中的最亮星，它属于二十八宿之一的氐宿，专有名称是氐宿一；也有叫它做天秤一的。现在每天早晨约六点钟左右，在北京地方正南方天空离地面约四十度高度地方，靠西边的亮星是角宿一，靠东边是天秤一，（更靠东边的一颗星就是木星）而这时候牧夫一正在天顶附近，光很亮。这三颗星很容易看出来，形成一个大的三角形。
