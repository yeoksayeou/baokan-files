Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: TASS reports: Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, issued a statement at a press conference held in the Kremlin on the 24th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Soviet and foreign newspapers have already reported in considerable detail on my visit to the United States, and some of my talks, as well as the talks of American leaders, have also been published. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat what you already know.

    During my stay in the United States, I visited several large cities I had visited in past - Washington, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. I had extremely interesting conversations with representatives of various strata of the American people - workers, office workers, university students, businessmen, social activists, and political figures, as well as many journalists from the American press, radio, and television.

    The Americans I spoke with warmly welcomed us and expressed the kindest feelings towards the Soviet people.

    When I visited some factory workshops, the workers and employees of Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Corporation, and General Motors in Detroit, the workers of Lincoln Motor Company in Cleveland, the students of the University of California in Los Angeles, as well as the American residents we visited, and some other Americans whom we happened to meet, asked me to send their greetings to the Soviet people and said that the American people hope to live in peace and friendship with the Soviet people.

    Business people in New York and other American cities I visited frankly stated that our relations should be normalized and that the Soviet Union and the United States should be brought closer together, thereby consolidating world peace. They unanimously hoped to establish business relations with our country on the basis of respecting each other's interests and making every effort to develop trade relations.

    Due attention must be paid to this rational attitude of American businessmen towards the issue. Of course, we understand that the existence of this sentiment itself cannot solve the mature question of developing trade between our two countries. To a large extent, it will now depend on the extent to which this sentiment can be reflected in the policies of the American government. Unfortunately, there is no sign of any change in this regard at present. The Soviet government, for its part, has already put forward its own proposals. You are all, of course, familiar with the letter that Khrushchev, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, sent to President Eisenhower on June 2nd of last year on the issue of trade. The letter emphasized that developing normal trade relations between our two countries would be an important means of building trust. And President Eisenhower's reply was generally well-intentioned. On this issue, my talks with American officials have not yet yielded positive results. Apparently, the American government is not yet prepared to develop trade with us. Well, then we will have to wait for a better opportunity.

    As you already know, during my visit to the United States, I held talks with President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, senators, governors, and some other American leaders. We frankly expressed our hope to understand the attitude of the American leaders, and at the same time, we also wanted to explain our own attitude. The attitude was very serious on both our side and on the side of our interlocutors. We and the American leaders admitted that these talks were beneficial. It can be stated with satisfaction that American political activists, unlike their attitude not long ago, expressed their desire to improve Soviet-American relations and emphasized that holding contacts and talks at all levels is necessary and beneficial. Of course, these opinions of American political activists have not yet manifested themselves in any practical steps of the American government. Not only that, but on urgent international issues, the American government continues to adopt a position that disregards the current situation and actual facts. It has not made the necessary efforts to solve these problems on the basis of considering the mutual interests of all countries.

    When discussing these issues, the American side showed a certain cautious and implicit attitude, which did not give people the feeling that there was a desire to reach an agreement on the most important international issues, even though it had repeatedly stated its hope to conduct negotiations and reach agreements.

    Naturally, we have repeatedly pointed out that this situation is abnormal: that the Soviet side has put forward one proposal after another in order to seek a constructive solution, while the other side is limited to rejecting these proposals and does not make active contributions.

    After returning from the United States, I have reported on this visit to our government. I can tell you that the government fully agrees with my activities during my visit to the United States, and it believes that the results of this visit will help to further ease international tensions and improve Soviet-American relations.

    Our government is satisfied with the attention paid to me by American President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, and other officials. If Americans were to visit the Soviet Union, our government would reciprocate with the same warm hospitality.

    Someone asked me to talk about my overall impression of this visit to the United States.

    The answer to this question can be roughly given as follows: There is now a view that, despite the manifestations of the "Cold War" and despite many misunderstandings in the United States about the Soviet Union and the Soviet position, the overall atmosphere is now conducive to moving towards strengthening peace. More and more Americans are beginning to realize that, under modern conditions, war and threats of war are not appropriate ways to solve international problems. In modern times, these cannot be the basis of international relations, especially in relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The American people want peace and friendship with the Soviet people and the people of other countries. This cannot but make us happy. This strengthens everyone's confidence that, as long as the Soviet Union and the United States work together with other countries, they can and will create conditions for the peaceful and tranquil life of all peoples.

    Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to American President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, and all the groups and individuals who warmly received me. While I was in the United States, I received many invitations from American groups and individuals. I regret that I was unable to accept all of these invitations due to lack of time. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to all these groups and individuals for their invitations and for the kindness they expressed towards the Soviet people in their invitations.

    Mikoyan then answered many questions raised by Soviet and other foreign journalists.

    米高扬就美国之行发表声明
    美国人民希望和平共处  改善美苏关系有待努力
    新华社25日讯  塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬24日在克里姆林宫举行的记者招待会上发表声明。声明全文如下：
    苏联和外国的报纸都已经相当详细地报道了我访问美国的情况，我的一些谈话以及美国领导人的谈话也都刊登过了。因此我不打算再重复你们已经知道的东西。
    我在美国逗留期间，访问了几个我过去曾经到过的大城市——华盛顿、克利夫兰、底特律、芝加哥、旧金山、洛杉矶和纽约。我同美国人民各个不同阶层的代表——工人、职员、大学生、商人、社会活动家和政界人士，以及美国报刊、电台和电视台的许多记者进行了十分有趣的谈话。
    同我谈过话的美国人都非常热烈地欢迎我们，对苏联人民表示了最善意的感情。
    当我参观一些工厂车间的时候，底特律的福特汽车公司、克莱斯勒公司、通用汽车公司的工人和职员，克利夫兰的林肯汽车公司的工人，洛杉矶加利福尼亚大学的学生，以及我们访问过的美国居民，和我们碰到过的其他一些美国人，都要我向苏联人致意，并且说美国人民希望和苏联人民和平友好地相处。
    纽约和我访问过的美国其他城市的实业界人士都很坦率地说，应该使我们的关系正常化，并保证苏联和美国能彼此接近，从而巩固世界和平。他们一致希望在尊重彼此利益和尽力发展贸易关系的基础上同我国建立事务关系。
    对于美国商人对待问题的这种有理智的态度不能不给予应有的注意。我们当然明白，存在这种情绪的存在本身还不能解决已经成熟了的关于发展我们两国贸易的问题。现在在很大程度上将取决于这种情绪在美国政府的政策上能够反映到什么程度。遗憾的是，在这方面现在还看不出有任何转变。苏联政府这一方面已经提出了自己的建议。你们当然都熟知苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫去年6月2日给艾森豪威尔总统的那封关于贸易问题的信。这封信强调指出，发展我们两国之间的正常贸易关系将是建立信任的重要手段。而艾森豪威尔总统的复信一般说来也是善意的。在这个问题上，我同美国官方人士的谈话暂时还没有得到肯定的结果。显然美国政府还不准备同我们发展贸易。好吧，那么只好再等待更好的时机吧。
    你们已经知道，我在美国访问期间同总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯、参议员们、州长们以及其他一些美国的领导人举行了谈话。我们坦率地表示，希望了解美国领导人的态度，同时也很想说明自己的态度。无论是我们这一方面，还是我们谈话的对方，态度都是很认真的。我们和美国的领导人都承认这些谈话是有益的。可以满意地指出，美国政治活动家同不久以前的态度不同了，他们表示要改善苏美关系，并且强调指出举行各级的接触和会谈是必要和有益的。当然，美国政治活动家的这些意见在美国政府的任何实际步骤之中还没有什么表现。不但如此，在迫切的国际问题上美国政府继续采取不考虑当前局势和实际事实的立场，它没有作必要的努力，在考虑各国的相互利益的基础上来解决这些问题。
    在讨论这些问题时，美国方面表现出某种谨慎含蓄的态度，使人感不到有就最重要的国际问题达成协议的愿望，尽管它曾经多次声明希望进行谈判和达成协议。
    自然，我们曾经反复指出这种情况是不正常的，就是：苏联一方为了求得建设性的解决，提出一个建议又一个建议，另一方却只限于拒绝这些建议并且不作积极的贡献。
    从美国回来以后，我已经向我国政府作了关于这次访问的报告。我可以告诉各位，政府完全赞同我在访问美国期间的活动，它认为这次访问的结果有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和改善苏美关系。
    我国政府对美国总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯和其他官员对我的关注表示满意。如果美国人将访问苏联，我国政府将报之以同样盛情的招待。
    有人要我谈一下，这次访美的总的印象如何。
    对这一问题大致可以这样回答：现在已形成这样一种见解，尽管有“冷战”的表现，尽管美国对苏联、对苏联立场有许多误解，但是整个气氛现在是有利于向加强和平方面迈步的。越来越多的美国人开始了解到，在现代的情况下，战争和以战争相威胁并不是解决国际问题的适当办法，在现代，不能把这些作为国际关系的基础，特别是在同苏联以及其他社会主义国家的关系上更是这样。美国人民希望和平和同苏联人民及其他各国人民友好。这不能不使我们感到高兴。这加强了大家的信心：只要苏联和美国同其他国家共同努力，就能够而且一定会为各国人民的和平安宁的生活创造条件。
    乘此机会，我向美国总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯以及一切对我热忱招待的团体和个人表示衷心感谢。我在美国时接到了美国的团体和个人的许多邀请，很遗憾，由于时间不够，未能一一接受这些邀请。我要向所有这些团体和个人表示最衷心的感谢，感谢他们对我的邀请，感谢他们在邀请中对苏联人民表示的盛情。
    米高扬接着答复了苏联和其他国家记者提出的许多问题。
