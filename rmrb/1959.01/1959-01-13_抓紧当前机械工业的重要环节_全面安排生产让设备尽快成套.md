Taiyuan: Establishing a Headquarters to Strengthen Production Leadership

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 12th dispatch) Taiyuan City has strengthened its leadership over machinery manufacturing work, enabling manufactured machinery to be quickly completed. The city's twenty or so machinery manufacturing and processing factories, some of which are not very large, have produced complete sets of power station, steel rolling, mining, and coking equipment, as well as blast furnaces, converters, and iron melting furnaces, totaling 634 items and 22,758 sets in two and a half months, equivalent to the amount completed in the past two years. This provides reliable material conditions for this year's production.

In the past, the various machinery factories in Taiyuan City mostly carried out production according to their own plans. There was little unified arrangement with other factories in terms of production plans and manufacturing progress. Many machines made by various factories were either missing this part or that part, and could not be completed for a long time. In order to change this situation, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that Ma Guishu, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and Li Wenjie, Deputy Mayor of Taiyuan City, would take the lead, drawing more than ten workers, foremen, technicians, and dispatchers familiar with the factory's production situation from various machinery factories to form a complete equipment production headquarters to lead this work. The headquarters organized all the factories in Taiyuan City that could manufacture and repair into the complete manufacturing work. The headquarters, according to the production capacity, technical level, and equipment conditions of each factory, decided who could do what and assigned the work, and whoever had a large equipment capacity was responsible for the overall assembly. And according to the complete requirements, the delivery date of parts from each factory was formulated. Each machinery factory manufactured according to the plan of the headquarters, which doubled the completion rate. Thousands of machines that could not be completed for many years were quickly completed.

In leading the complete equipment production, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on the one hand, criticized the erroneous ideas of "producing behind closed doors, regardless of the completion of machines" and "equipping oneself first, manufacturing complete parts second," and improved the understanding of each factory on complete production. On the other hand, it organized collaboration and promptly solved the problems that arose in complete production, greatly avoiding the phenomenon of delayed completion. The machinery factories also listed the complete parts as first-line products.

Shaanxi: Strengthening Inspection Work to Ensure Key Needs

(Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th dispatch) Shaanxi Province is actively inspecting the matching of machinery and equipment in order to further unify the organization of equipment matching work and ensure the needs of key construction projects.

Currently, the province has formed an equipment matching inspection team headed by Deputy Governor Yang Zhengmin, which will go to key construction units and machinery factories to mobilize and rely on the masses of workers to inspect equipment matching work. The main contents of the inspection are: to understand the types, quantities, supply, and matching of equipment required by each construction unit; to conduct a detailed survey of the equipment, technical strength, product types, production capacity, and required raw materials of each machinery factory. After the inspection, the relevant departments will make unified plans and arrangements for the province's machinery industry production based on these situations, determine the production tasks of each factory according to the types and quantities of equipment required for key projects, and organize matching work. In this way, it can not only solve the problem of equipment matching, but also ensure that all equipment and materials are used for key construction projects.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the machinery industry in Shaanxi Province has successfully trial-produced many metallurgical, power generation, and chemical equipment. In the third and fourth quarters of last year, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized the province's machinery industry to produce a lot of complete sets of metallurgical equipment. However, at that time, due to production capacity and raw material supply and other reasons, some products could not be matched and could not be quickly put into production. In order to adapt to a greater leap forward this year, the Provincial Party Committee decided to uniformly organize complete production for the equipment needed for key projects in the metallurgical, power generation, mining, chemical, petroleum, machinery, and light industries.

Jilin: More Than Two Hundred Enterprises Implement Large-Scale Collaboration

(According to Jilin Daily news) Two hundred and sixty-six enterprises in Jilin Province are collaborating on a large scale to manufacture complete sets of smelting equipment to arm the Tonghua Iron and Steel Base and steel plants in various places. Now, more than 310 sets of equipment such as blast furnaces, converters, electric arc steelmaking furnaces, and rolling mills have been manufactured and are being transferred to the Tonghua Iron and Steel Base and other key steel plants. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of complete production, the province established a complete company in November last year. The production of smelting equipment is uniformly arranged and dispatched according to plan, so the equipment completion work is progressing relatively quickly.

As of December 25, 1958, the construction of blast furnaces in various parts of Jilin Province had reached 275 new furnaces under construction. These blast furnaces are mainly built at the Tonghua Iron and Steel Base. Among these 275 furnaces, 97 have been completed and put into production one after another. At present, there are still hundreds of foreign blast furnaces in the province speeding up winter construction to ensure that all of them are put into production in the first quarter, and there is an urgent need to supply complete sets of smelting equipment as soon as possible.

In organizing this complete set of smelting equipment production, large-scale collaboration was implemented according to the different equipment and technical conditions of each machinery factory. It was determined that several major machinery factories in Changchun, Jilin, Siping and other cities would be responsible for manufacturing the more technically complex furnace body, dust collector, hoist, feeding hopper, blower, motor, transformer and other equipment on the blast furnace. General parts are manufactured by machinery factories in various cities and counties. Large forgings, large diesel engines and other equipment are borne by large factories such as Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. This solves the various difficulties of a single factory undertaking the production of complete sets of equipment, saves time, and accelerates the production speed of complete sets of equipment.

Yunnan: Doing Everything Possible to Prepare Spare Parts for Rolling Mill Main Engines

(Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 12th dispatch) The industrial departments of Yunnan Province are doing everything possible to produce supporting equipment for rolling mills. Now, the main accessories for a rolling mill with an annual output of 130,000 tons of steel and a rolling mill with an annual output of 10,000 tons of steel have been basically prepared and have been trial run successively.

Yunnan Province's steel production has increased greatly last year, and will increase more than last year this year, but the rolling equipment capacity is not adapted to the steelmaking capacity, and the normal rolling capacity is only equal to about one-fifth of the steel production plan. In the past few months, Yunnan Province has successfully self-made a rolling mill main engine with an annual output of 10,000 tons of steel, and a main engine with an annual output of 30,000 tons of steel is being manufactured. Sichuan and other provinces and cities have also supported several rolling mill main parts. How to speed up the production of accessories for these rolling mills and put them into production has become one of the important issues in current steel production.

The industrial departments of Yunnan Province adopted a comprehensive flowering and clear division of labor method, grouping and dividing dozens of larger factories according to different production conditions and work nature, and producing various accessories for rolling mills, which has achieved remarkable results in the past few months. Now, a rolling mill with an annual output of 130,000 tons of steel supported by Tangshan to Yunnan is being installed in the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, and most of the nearly 100 accessories required have been manufactured by local factories.

    抓紧当前机械工业的重要环节
    全面安排生产让设备尽快成套
    太原：成立指挥部加强生产领导
    本报太原12日电　太原市加强对机械制造工作的领导以后，使制造的机械迅速成套。这个市的二十个有些规模并不大的机械制造和加工工厂，在两个半月内，已经生产出成套的电站、轧钢、采矿和焦化设备，以及高炉、转炉、化铁炉等六百三十四项，共二万二千七百五十八台套，等于过去两年的成套量。这为今年生产提供了可靠的物质条件。
    太原市的各个机械工厂，过去大都是各厂按自己的计划进行生产，在生产计划上和制造进度上很少和别厂进行统一安排，很多由各厂分做的机器不是少这个部件，就是少那个部件，而长期成不了套。中共太原市委为了改变这种状况，决定由市委书记处书记麻贵书和太原市副市长李文杰挂帅，从各机械工厂抽调了熟悉工厂生产情况的工人、工长、技术员、调度员等十多人，组成了设备成套生产指挥部，对这一工作进行领导。指挥部把太原市所有能够制造和修配的工厂都组织进了成套制造的工作中。指挥部根据各厂的生产能力，技术水平和设备条件，决定谁能做什么就给做什么，谁家装备能力大就由谁家负责总装配。并且根据成套要求，制订出各厂交部件日期。各个机械工厂根据指挥部的计划进行制造，使成套率成倍的增加。过去成年成不了套的几千台机器，很快都成了套。
    中共太原市委在领导设备成套生产中，一方面批判“关起门来生产，不顾机器成套”和“装备自己第一，制造成套部件第二”等错误思想，提高各厂对成套生产的认识。一方面组织协作，及时解决成套生产中出现的问题，大大避免了成套拖延现象。各机械工厂还把成套的部件列为第一线产品。
    陕西：加强检查工作　保证重点需要
    据新华社西安12日电　陕西省正在积极检查机器设备配套的情况，以便进一步统一组织设备配套工作，保证重点建设的需要。
    目前，全省已经组成以杨拯民副省长为首的设备配套检查组，分赴各重点建设单位和机械厂，发动和依靠职工群众对设备配套工作进行检查。检查的主要内容是：了解各建设单位所需设备的品种、数量及供应、配套等情况；对各机械厂的设备、技术力量、产品品种、生产能力及所需原料等进行详细摸底。检查结束后，有关部门就要根据这些情况，对全省的机械工业生产进行统一规划和安排，按照重点工程所需设备的品种和数量确定各厂生产任务，组织配套工作。这样，既可解决设备配套问题，又能保证把所有设备和材料用于重点建设。
    大跃进以来，陕西省机械工业试制成功很多冶金、发电、化工设备，去年第三、四季度，中共陕西省委就组织全省机械工业生产了不少成套的冶金设备，但是，当时由于生产能力和原料供应等原因，有些产品配不成套，不能很快用到生产上去。为了适应今年更大的跃进，省委决定对冶金、发电、矿山、化工、石油、机械、轻工等行业的重点工程所需要的设备，统一组织配套生产。
    吉林：二百多企业实行大协作
    据吉林日报消息　吉林省二百六十六个企业大协作，制造成套冶炼设备，武装通化钢铁基地和各地钢铁厂。现在已制出高炉、转炉、电孤炼钢炉、轧钢机等设备三百一十多套，陆续调运通化钢铁基地和其他重点钢铁厂。为了加强配套生产的组织领导，该省于去年11月就成立了配套公司，冶炼设备的生产按计划统一安排，统一调度，因而设备成套工作进行的比较迅速。
    吉林省各地的高炉建设截至1958年12月25日统计，动工新建的高炉已达二百七十五座。这批高炉主要是建设在通化钢铁基地。在这二百七十五座炉中，已经有九十七座先后建成并陆续投入生产。目前全省还有上百座洋高炉在加速进行冬季施工，以保证第一季度全部投入生产，迫切要求尽快供应成套冶炼设备。
    组织这次成套冶炼设备生产中，又根据各机械厂不同的设备、技术情况实行大协作。确定长春、吉林、四平等市的几个主要机械厂，负责制造高炉上技术比较复杂的炉体、贮尘器、卷扬机、给料斗、鼓风机、电动机、变压器等设备。一般部件由各市县的机械厂负责制造。大型锻件、大型柴油机等设备，由长春第一汽车制造厂等大厂负担。这样便解决了由一个厂子担负成套设备生产的各种困难，争取了时间，加快了成套设备的生产速度。
    云南：千方百计为轧钢主机备齐配件
    据新华社昆明12日电　云南省工业部门千方百计为轧钢机生产配套设备。现在，一台年产十三万吨钢材的轧钢机和一台年产一万吨钢材的轧钢机的主要配件已经基本备齐，先后试行运转。
    云南省的钢铁生产在去年有了很大增长，今年还将比去年增长，但是轧钢设备能力和炼钢的能力不相适应，正常的轧钢能力只等于钢材生产计划的五分之一左右。几个月来，云南省自制成功了年产一万吨钢材的轧钢主机，一台年产三万吨钢材的主机正在制造，四川等省、市又支援了几台轧钢机主件。如何加紧为这些轧钢机生产配件，使之投入生产，就成了当前钢铁生产上重要问题之一。
    云南省工业部门采用全面开花、明确分工的办法，把几十个较大型的工厂按不同的生产条件和工作性质编组分工，为轧钢机生产各种配件，几个月来已获得显著效果。现在，唐山支援云南的一台年产十三万吨钢材的轧钢机，正在昆明钢铁厂安装，所需的近百项配件，绝大部分已由当地各工厂制造出来。
