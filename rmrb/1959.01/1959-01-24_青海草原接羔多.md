From our correspondent in Xining on January 23rd: On the Qinghai grasslands, the broad masses of herdsmen are braving the freezing cold to carry out lambing and lamb rearing, as well as frost prevention and animal protection work.

Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture's Tongren, Zeku, and Jianzha counties, and Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture's Tianjun county, are actively engaged in lambing and rearing. The lamb survival rate in various areas is generally stable above 90%; at the same time, the number of healthy and fully surviving lambs is increasing daily. By January 7, five sheep flocks in the Dongfeng People's Commune of Tongren County had achieved a 100% lamb survival rate and were awarded the title of "Red Flag." This commune has delivered more than 5,000 lambs, with a survival rate of over 93%. The Second Production Team of the Tianjun Rocket People's Commune, which has relatively poor breeding conditions, achieved a lambing survival rate of 91% by the end of December last year, a significant improvement over previous years.

    青海草原接羔多
    本报西宁23日电　青海草原上广大牧民群众，正冒着天寒地冻进行接羔育羔和防冻保畜工作。
    黄南藏族自治州同仁、泽库、尖扎等县，海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州的天峻等县，正积极进行接羔育羔。各地羔羊成活率一般都稳定在90％以上；同时全活健壮的也日有增加。同仁县东风人民公社到1月7日，有五个羊群羔羊成活率达到百分之百，被评为“红旗”。这个社共接羔五千多只，成活率达到93％以上。饲养条件较差的天峻火箭人民公社第二生产队，在去年12月底，接羔成活率达到91％，比往年有很大提高。
