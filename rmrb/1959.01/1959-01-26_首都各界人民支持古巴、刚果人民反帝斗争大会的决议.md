    The people of all circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China solemnly held a meeting on January 25, 1959, representing 650 million people of China, to warmly celebrate and cheer the great victory of the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle, and to extend brotherly and warm respect to the heroic Congolese people.
    Our common enemy is imperialism. The Chinese people, who have suffered from more than a century of imperialist enslavement, fully sympathize with and support the Cuban people's just struggle to defend national independence and oppose the interference of American imperialism, and fully sympathize with and support the Congolese people's tenacious and heroic struggle against the bloody suppression by Belgian colonialists.
    The conference unanimously pointed out that all imperialists and colonialists in the world are rotting day by day, and the forces of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism are growing stronger day by day. The heroic struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people are part of the cause of the Latin American and African people for independence and freedom, and are part of the cause of the world's people for maintaining peace. Their struggles have received the deep sympathy and support of the people of the world. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Cuban people, under the leadership of Castro, will surely achieve more brilliant victories in the glorious cause of striving for independence and freedom. The Chinese people firmly believe that the heroic Congolese people will strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, and finally completely drive the colonialists out of their territory.

    中华人民共和国首都各界人民，于1959年1月25日隆重举行集会，代表全中国六亿五千万人民热烈庆贺和欢呼古巴人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，并向英勇奋斗的刚果人民致以兄弟的热烈的敬意。
    我们的共同敌人就是帝国主义。深受过一百多年帝国主义奴役的中国人民，完全同情和支持古巴人民保卫民族独立、反对美国帝国主义干涉的正义斗争，完全同情和支持刚果人民顽强英勇的反抗比利时殖民主义者的血腥镇压的斗争。
    大会一致指出，世界上所有的帝国主义者和殖民主义者正在一天天烂下去，全世界反帝国主义、反殖民主义的力量正在一天天壮大起来。古巴人民和刚果人民的英勇斗争是拉丁美洲和非洲人民争取独立和自由事业的一部分，是全世界人民维护和平事业的一部分。他们的斗争得到全世界人民的深切同情和支持。中国人民深信，在卡斯特罗领导下的古巴人民，在争取独立、自由的光荣事业中，一定会取得更辉煌的胜利。中国人民深信，英勇的刚果人民必将加强团结，克服困难，最后把殖民主义者从自己的领土上完全赶出去。
