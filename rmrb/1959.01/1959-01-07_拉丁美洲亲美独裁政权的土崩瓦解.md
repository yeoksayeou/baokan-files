    The Collapse of Pro-American Dictatorial Regimes in Latin America
    Zhang Ye

    On January 1, the Batista regime, one of the three remaining dictatorial regimes in Latin America (the other two being the Dominican Republic and Paraguay) and the public enemy of the Cuban people, collapsed. This is another significant victory in the struggle of national democratic forces in Latin America against dictatorial rule and for democratic freedom in recent years.
    
    Ten Dictatorial Regimes Collapse in Four Years
    The struggle against the pro-US imperialist agent – the traitorous dictatorial regime – is an important part of the Latin American people's national independence movement. In the four years since 1955, ten dictatorial regimes in Latin American countries have collapsed one after another:
    
    In January 1955, Panamanian dictator Remón was assassinated and succeeded by Vice President Espinosa. Presidential elections were held in May 1956, and Guizado was elected, taking office in October of the same year.
    
    In September 1955, the Argentine military launched a coup, overthrowing the Perón dictatorial regime. After the collapse of the Perón regime, Argentina experienced a period of rule by military groups that launched the coup. Presidential elections were held in February 1958, and Frondizi, the presidential candidate of the "Intransigent Radical Civic Union," was elected.
    
    In March 1956, El Salvador held presidential elections, and Lemus was elected, taking office in September of the same year, ending the dictatorial rule of Osorio, who came to power in 1948 through a US-orchestrated coup. Although Lemus was the Minister of Interior in the previous dictatorial government, he adopted some democratic measures different from those of previous governments after taking office, such as allowing exiled political figures, including communists, to return home and abolishing the former government's decrees suppressing the people.
    
    In February 1956, a military coup against the dictatorial tyrant Odría took place in Peru. Although it was unsuccessful, it shook the dictator's rule. Presidential elections were held in June of the same year, and Lavalle, the presidential candidate supported by Odría, suffered a crushing defeat. Prado was elected president and took office in July, and the Peruvian dictatorial regime collapsed.
    
    In September 1956, Nicaraguan dictator Somoza was assassinated and succeeded by his son, Luis Somoza (the then Speaker of the House of Representatives), as acting president. In February 1957, Luis Somoza won the presidential election and took office in May of the same year. Since then, under the pressure of the people, Luis Somoza has slightly relaxed his exclusive control of power and restrictions on freedom of speech. The Nicaraguan people are continuing to struggle for further democratization of the country.
    
    In December 1956, the people of Haiti held a general strike and demonstrations, defeating the coup plot of the outgoing dictatorial president Magloire. In February 1957, they overthrew the interim president Pierre-Louis, who openly sought to restore the old dictatorship, and elected Sylvio as interim president. Presidential elections were held in September of the same year, and Duvalier was elected, taking office in October.
    
    In May 1957, Colombian dictator Rojas Pinilla was forced to resign under the pressure of popular movements involving strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations. The military government took over the power. Presidential elections were held in May 1958, and Camargo was elected, taking office in August, ending a decade of military dictatorship.
    
    In July 1957, the dictatorial tyrant Armas, who had overthrown the democratic government of Árbenz in Guatemala under US instigation, was assassinated. Presidential elections were held in October. Due to the falsification of votes, Colonel Azurdia launched a coup, formed a military government, and declared the election invalid. Presidential elections were held again in January 1958, and a runoff election was held in February. Fuentes was elected and took office in March.
    
    In January 1958, the Jiménez dictatorial regime, which had ruled Venezuela for ten years, was overthrown by a military uprising supported by powerful popular strikes, demonstrations, and marches. A military junta headed by Rear Admiral Larrazábal was established. Presidential elections were held on December 7 of the same year, and Betancourt, the chairman of the Democratic Action Party, was elected.
    
    In January 1959, under the increasing strength of the Cuban people's struggle against dictatorial rule and the powerful offensive of the rebel forces led by Castro, the Batista dictatorial regime collapsed, and Batista and his followers fled abroad. Urrutia, nominated by Castro, has taken office as interim president and formed a government.
    
    Currently, the dictatorial rule in the only remaining two countries, Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, is also very unstable. In southern Paraguay, armed struggles against the Stroessner dictatorial regime broke out in April 1958, and the "Citizens' Army for Paraguayan Freedom," with more than a thousand people, was formed. The struggle of the Dominican people is also gradually unfolding. The parliament, which has always been controlled by the dictator, passed a resolution in August 1958 demanding the abolition of the agreement signed with the United States regarding US military assistance and assistance in US rocket testing.
    
    The collapse of dictatorial regimes in Latin America is a heavy blow to the US imperialist colonial policy of enslaving and oppressing the Latin American people, forming a huge wave in the Latin American national independence movement.
    
    The Mass Character of the Anti-Dictatorial Struggle
    The struggles to overthrow dictatorial regimes in Latin America in recent years have been carried out and won through various different forms. Some were achieved through military coups, followed by democratic elections to restore democratic rule of law, such as Argentina; some were achieved through the assassination of dictators by the opposition, followed by elections to establish new governments, such as Panama and Guatemala; some were achieved under the pressure of powerful popular movements involving strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations, with the military participating in the action and taking control of the government, and then forming a government through elections, such as Haiti, Colombia, and Venezuela; some were achieved through elections, resulting in a crushing defeat of dictatorial forces, such as El Salvador and Peru; some were overthrown through armed struggle under the unanimous opposition of the people, such as Cuba.
    
    Despite the different forms in which these dictatorial regimes were overthrown, they all reflect the people's hatred for pro-US dictatorial regimes and their desire for democracy and independence. In the struggles against dictatorial regimes in various countries, the people have become increasingly awakened and have widely participated in the struggles. For example, the anti-dictatorial struggle in Venezuela was triggered by a general strike declared by the Patriotic Committee, in which the Communist Party of Venezuela participated, and overthrew Jiménez. The reason why the Cuban rebel army led by Castro was able to grow from eighty-odd people to more than eleven thousand in two years and one month, and expand from the small base of the Sierra Maestra to the whole country, and finally defeat the Batista dictatorial regime, is inseparable from the active support and participation of people from all walks of life in Cuba. This situation shows that the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of Latin American countries, to varying degrees, have the progressive content and nature of the people's struggle for national independence and democratic freedom.
    
    The awakening of the masses of people in Latin American countries is not only an important factor in overthrowing dictatorial regimes, but also an important factor in ensuring national democratic development and striving for national independence and social progress. The Venezuelan people's crushing of the US imperialist-orchestrated coup plots to restore the dictatorial system three times and ensuring the holding of the presidential election on December 7, 1958, as scheduled, is the result of the Venezuelan people's perseverance in unity and heroic struggle. The Argentine people are also waging a tenacious struggle against the compromise and surrender policies of the Frondizi government. The formal contract between the Argentine government and the "American Group" headed by the Atlas Corporation to jointly exploit Argentine oil has not been signed, which is the result of the Argentine people's vigorous struggle. The people of other Latin American countries are also waging new struggles to safeguard national independence and democratic rule of law and strive for social progress.
    
    In the struggle against dictatorship and for independence and freedom, the Communist Parties of Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile have successively gained legal status. The Communist Parties of Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, and other countries have been able to carry out legal and semi-legal public activities. In the 1958 elections, the prestige and influence of the Communist Parties of Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Venezuela increased. These are all signs of the development of democratic and progressive forces in Latin America.
    
    The Failure of US Imperialism
    Another characteristic of the Latin American people's anti-dictatorial struggle is that this struggle is closely linked with the struggle against US imperialist enslavement, oppression, and intervention. Therefore, the victory of the anti-dictatorial struggle is the failure of US imperialism.
    
    As everyone knows, all the dictatorial regimes in Latin American countries were fostered and fully supported by US imperialism. These dictatorial regimes implemented fascist bloody rule internally, deprived people of freedom, and persecuted patriotic and democratic forces; externally, they relied on the United States, sold out national sovereignty and national wealth, and served US monopoly capital. However, the US imperialist act of supporting anti-people dictatorial regimes inevitably leads to its opposite, arousing strong opposition from the people of all strata in the country, including the national bourgeoisie, converging into an irresistible torrent of anti-dictatorial and anti-US struggle, and finally overthrowing the dictator. The Argentine dictator Perón, in the early days of his rule, in order to consolidate his regime, put forward the slogan of economic independence, nationalized some foreign enterprises, and implemented a social relief system and some measures to improve people's lives, thus deceiving the support of many people. However, when he openly relied on the United States, especially in the spring of 1955, when he signed a contract with the US "California Mobil Oil Company" and transferred the exploration and exploitation rights of 49,800 square kilometers of land area to this company, the people's dissatisfaction immediately increased, prompting the victory of the Argentine military coup that overthrew Perón.
    
    As for the downfall of Venezuelan dictator Jiménez and Cuban dictator Batista, it is even more sufficient to show that the Latin American people's anti-dictatorial struggle is actually an aspect of the anti-US struggle. Jiménez and Batista can be said to be the most loyal servants of US imperialism. The United States has 3 billion US dollars of investment in Venezuela, with annual profits of more than 600 million US dollars. During the Jiménez regime, a large amount of oil exploration rights were transferred to the United States. In just two years, 1956 and 1957, oil exploration rights for approximately 1.5 million hectares of land area were transferred to the United States, allowing US monopoly capital to plunder more than 70% of Venezuela's oil. The situation in Cuba is roughly the same. During Batista's rule, US monopoly capital obtained the most convenient conditions for plundering Cuban wealth. Even two months ago, Batista signed a bill to facilitate the economic plunder of foreign companies in order to gain the support of US imperialism, stipulating that foreign companies could manage the enterprises they operated in Cuba, and that the profits, dividends, funds, and excess profits they obtained would not be taxed. Therefore, although Cuba's land area ranks thirteenth among Latin American countries, the United States' direct investment reaches more than one billion US dollars, accounting for the third largest share of US direct investment in Latin American countries. Two-thirds of this one billion US dollars was invested during Batista's rule. Batista's traitorous acts enabled US monopoly capital to control Cuba's sugar, iron ore, nickel ore, and other economic lifelines, and seize huge profits. In the past five years alone, the United States has plundered more than 750 million US dollars in profits from Cuba.
    
    The traitorous acts of the Latin American dictatorial regimes violated the national interests of these countries and plunged the people into poverty and powerlessness. Therefore, the dictatorial regimes were opposed by the people, and US imperialism became the most hated enemy of the Latin American people. With the rise of the anti-dictatorial struggle, anti-US sentiment in Latin America has also increased. The expulsion, beating, and cursing of Nixon, Dulles, and Milton Eisenhower during their "visits" to South America are the best illustrations.
    
    The Complexity of the Anti-Dictatorial and Anti-US Struggle
    Although the Latin American people's anti-dictatorial and anti-US struggle has continuously achieved victories with the active participation and support of the masses, especially the working class, US imperialism is still using the economic dependence it has created in Latin America and the reactionary forces it has bought to carry out various intervention and subversion activities, undermining the fruits of the anti-dictatorial struggle. At the same time, due to the different forms in which dictatorial regimes are overthrown, the degree of development of the people's movements in various countries, and the contrast between patriotic and democratic forces and reactionary and surrender forces, the process of the anti-dictatorial struggle and the struggle to consolidate the fruits of victory in these countries has a certain degree of twists and turns and complexity.
    
    Currently, in the countries that have achieved victory in the anti-dictatorial struggle, the struggle to maintain independence, develop democracy, and strive for economic development is still very arduous. In Venezuela and Colombia, the new governments have taken some measures to promote democracy and protect national interests, and the Communist Party has also regained legal status. But the situation in Nicaragua and Guatemala is very different. There are also some countries, such as Argentina, where Frondizi put forward a campaign program that conformed to the interests of the people and the nation when he ran for president. After taking office in May 1958, he also took some democratic measures. However, later, due to the opportunity of Argentina's economic difficulties, US imperialism and domestic reactionaries exerted great pressure, so that in recent times, the Frondizi government has shifted to the right and regressed. It has looked to the United States to overcome its economic difficulties externally, and has begun to attack the working class and the Communist Party, which resolutely defend national oil resources and maintain domestic democracy, internally.
    
    Faced with the development of the Latin American democratic national movement and the collapse of pro-US and traitorous dictatorial regimes, US imperialism is not reconciled. Just as the Communist Parties of Latin American countries pointed out in a joint declaration issued in December 1958, "Imperialism and its agents are trying to obstruct the development of this process; they are using all their strength to maintain some governments that engage in terrorist activities; making it difficult for those governments that act constitutionally; maintaining and deepening the instability of constitutional regimes in various countries; and conspiring to create coups like they did in Guatemala, attempting to carry out evil intervention activities; and inciting new persecution of the working class and the most resolute patriots." However, in the overall international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the national independence movement has become an unstoppable historical trend. The re-sabotage of US imperialism and all reactionaries can only arouse the Latin American people to become more aware, more determined to unite and persist in the struggle, so that US imperialism and its agents will suffer new and greater defeats.

    拉丁美洲亲美独裁政权的土崩瓦解
    章叶
    1月1日，拉丁美洲残存的三个独裁政权（另外两个是多米尼加和巴拉圭）之一、古巴人民公敌巴蒂斯塔政权垮台了。这是最近几年来拉丁美洲民族民主力量反对独裁统治、争取民主自由斗争的又一次重大胜利。
    四年间十个独裁政权垮台
    反对美帝国主义代理人——卖国独裁政权的斗争，是拉丁美洲人民民族独立运动的一个重要环节。在1955年以来的四年期间里，拉丁美洲国家先后有十个独裁政权垮台了：
    1955年1月，巴拿马独裁者里蒙被刺身死，由副总统埃斯皮诺萨继任。1956年5月举行总统选举，古阿迪亚当选，同年10月就职。
    1955年9月，阿根廷军人发动政变，推翻了庇隆独裁政权。在庇隆政权垮台后，阿根廷曾经历了一段发动政变的军人集团的统治时期，在1958年2月举行了总统选举，“不妥协激进公民联盟”总统候选人弗朗迪西当选。
    1956年3月，萨尔瓦多举行总统选举，雷穆斯当选，同年9月就任，结束了1948年在美国策动下发动政变上台的奥索里欧独裁统治。雷穆斯虽然是前独裁政府的内政部长，但在上台后采取了某些与以前历届政府不同的民主措施，如允许包括共产党人在内的流亡国外的政治人物回国，取消前政府的镇压人民的法令等。
    1956年2月，秘鲁曾发生反对独裁暴君俄德利亚的军事政变，虽然没有成功，却动摇了这个独裁者的统治地位。同年6月举行总统选举，俄德利亚支持的总统候选人拉瓦里惨败，普拉多当选总统，并在7月就职，秘鲁独裁政权遂告垮台。
    1956年9月，尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查遇刺身死，由其子路易斯·索摩查（原任众议院议长）代理总统。1957年2月，路易斯·索摩查竞选总统获胜，并在同年5月就职。此后路易斯·索摩查在人民的压力下在独揽政权、限制言论自由等方面稍有放松；尼加拉瓜人民正继续为国家进一步民主化而斗争。
    1956年12月，海地人民举行总罢工和游行示威，击败了任期已满的马格鲁阿独裁总统的政变阴谋；1957年2月，又推翻了公然为旧独裁者复辟的临时总统皮埃尔—路易士，选举了西尔瓦因为临时总统。同年9月举行总统选举，杜瓦利埃当选，10月就职。
    1957年5月，哥伦比亚独裁者罗哈斯·皮尼亚在罢工、罢课、游行示威的人民运动压力下被迫辞职，军政府接管了政权。1958年5月举行总统选举，卡马戈当选，并在8月就职，结束了十年之久的军事独裁统治。
    1957年7月，在美国策动下用武力推翻危地马拉阿本斯民主政府的独裁暴君阿马斯被刺丧命。10月举行总统选举，因伪造选票，由阿苏迪亚上校发动政变，组成军政府，并宣告选举无效。1958年1月重新举行总统选举，2月复选，富恩特斯当选，并在3月就职。
    1958年1月，统治委内瑞拉达十年之久的希门尼斯独裁政权被强大的人民罢工、示威、游行支持下的军人起义所推翻，成立了以拉腊萨巴耳海军少将为首的军政府委员会。同年12月7日举行总统选举，民主行动党的主席贝坦科尔特当选。
    1959年1月，在古巴人民反对独裁统治的斗争日益增强和卡斯特罗领导的起义部队的强大攻势下，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权垮台，巴蒂斯塔及其追随者逃亡国外。由卡斯特罗提名的乌鲁蒂亚已就任临时总统，并组成政府。
    现在，仅存的巴拉圭和多米尼加这两个国家的独裁统治，也是非常不稳的。巴拉圭南部在1958年4月间曾爆发了反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的武装斗争，并且组成拥有一千多人的“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”。多米尼加人民的斗争也在逐渐展开，一向由独裁者控制的议会在1958年8月通过一项决议，要求废除同美国签订的关于美国给予军事援助和协助美国试验火箭的协定。
    拉丁美洲独裁统治的纷纷垮台，是对美帝国主义奴役和压迫拉丁美洲人民的殖民政策的沉重打击，形成了拉丁美洲民族独立运动中的一支巨大浪潮。
    反独裁斗争的群众性
    几年来拉丁美洲推翻独裁政权的斗争，是通过各种不同的形式进行和取得胜利的。其中有的是通过军人举行政变，后来又经过民主选举而恢复民主法治的，如阿根廷；有的是独裁者被反对派暗杀，后来经过选举而建立新的政府的，如巴拿马和危地马拉；有的是在强大的人民运动的罢工、罢课和游行示威的压力下，军人参加了行动，并由军人掌握政权然后经过选举组成政府，如海地、哥伦比亚和委内瑞拉；有的是通过选举，使独裁势力遭到惨败的，如萨尔瓦多和秘鲁；有的是在全国人民一致反对下，通过武装斗争而被推翻的，如古巴。
    尽管这些独裁政权被推翻的形式不同，但都反映了人民群众对亲美独裁政权的仇恨和他们要求民主和独立的愿望。在各国反对独裁政权的斗争中，人民群众日益觉醒起来，并广泛地参加了斗争行动。例如，委内瑞拉的反独裁斗争，就是在有委内瑞拉共产党参加的爱国委员会宣布一次总罢工以后高涨起来而把希门尼斯推翻的。卡斯特罗领导的古巴起义军之所以能够在两年零一个月的期间内，从八十几个人发展到一万一千多人，从马埃斯特腊山这一个小小的根据地扩大到全国，并最后打垮巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，也是同古巴广泛阶层的人民的积极支持和参加分不开的。这种情况表明，拉丁美洲各国人民反独裁的斗争，在不同程度上具有人民群众争取民族独立和民主自由的进步内容和性质。
    拉丁美洲各国人民群众的觉醒，不仅是推翻独裁政权的重要因素，而且也是保证国家民主发展、争取民族独立和社会进步的重要因素。委内瑞拉人民粉碎了美帝国主义策动的三次复辟独裁制度的政变阴谋和保证1958年12月7日总统选举的如期举行，正是委内瑞拉人民坚持团结、英勇斗争的结果。阿根廷人民也正进行顽强的斗争反对弗朗迪西政府的妥协和投降政策；阿根廷政府同以阿特拉斯公司为首的“美国集团”共同开采阿根廷石油的正式合同未能签字，就是阿根廷人民奋起斗争的结果。拉丁美洲其他国家的人民也在为维护民族独立和民主法制、争取社会进步而进行着新的斗争。
    在反对独裁、争取独立自由的斗争中，哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉和智利三国共产党相继获得了合法地位。巴西、哥斯达黎加、秘鲁等国共产党已能进行合法和半合法的公开活动。在1958年的选举中，巴西、智利、乌拉圭和委内瑞拉等国共产党的威信和影响日益增长。这都是拉丁美洲民主进步力量发展的标志。
    美帝国主义的失败
    拉丁美洲人民反独裁斗争的另一特点是，这个斗争是同反对美帝国主义奴役压迫和干涉的斗争紧密结合在一起进行的。因此，反独裁斗争的胜利就是美帝国主义的失败。
    大家知道，所有拉丁美洲国家的独裁政权，都是美帝国主义所一手扶植、并且加以全力支持的。这些独裁政权对内实行法西斯血腥统治，剥夺人民自由，迫害爱国民主力量；对外投靠美国，出卖国家主权和民族财富，为美国垄断资本服务。但是美帝国主义扶植反人民的独裁政权的行为，不可避免地要走向它的反面，激起包括民族资产阶级在内的国内各阶层人民的强烈反对，汇成势不可挡的反独裁反美斗争的巨流，最后把独裁者推翻。阿根廷的独裁者庇隆在他执政初期，为了巩固自己的政权，曾提出了经济独立的口号，把一些外国企业收归国有，并实行了社会救济制度和一些改善人民生活的措施，因而骗取了不少群众的拥护；但是当他公开投靠美国，特别是在1955年春季，同美国“加利福尼亚美孚油公司”签订合同，把四万九千八百平方公里土地面积的勘探和开采石油权出让给这家公司以后，人民的不满情绪立即增长起来，促成了阿根廷军人推翻庇隆政变的胜利。
    至于委内瑞拉独裁者希门尼斯和古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔的倒台，更足以说明拉丁美洲人民反独裁斗争实际上是反美斗争的一个方面。希门尼斯和巴蒂斯塔可以说是美帝国主义最忠实的奴仆了。美国在委内瑞拉有三十亿美元的投资，每年获取的利润达六亿美元以上。希门尼斯执政时期向美国大量出让石油开采权，仅仅在1956和1957两年间，就向美国出让了约一百五十万公顷土地面积的石油开采权，使美国垄断资本掠夺了委内瑞拉70％以上的石油。古巴的情况也大体相同。在巴蒂斯塔统治期间，美国垄断资本取得了掠夺古巴财富最便利的条件，甚至在两个月以前，巴蒂斯塔为了换取美帝国主义的支持，还签署了一项便利外国公司经济掠夺的法案，规定外国公司可以管理在古巴所经营的企业，而且它们所获得的利润、红利、资金和超额利润都不要纳税。因此，古巴的土地面积虽然在拉丁美洲国家中占第十三位，而美国的直接投资却达十亿美元以上，占美国对拉丁美洲国家直接投资的第三位。在这十亿美元中，有三分之二是在巴蒂斯塔执政时投入的。巴蒂斯塔卖国行为，使美国垄断资本控制了古巴的制糖、铁矿、镍矿等经济命脉，并且攫取了巨额利润，仅仅在最近五年内，美国从古巴劫走的利润就达七亿五千万美元以上。
    拉丁美洲独裁政权的卖国行为，违反了这些国家的民族利益，使人民陷于贫穷和无权的地位，因而，也使独裁政权受到人民的反对，使美帝国主义成为拉丁美洲人民最憎恨的敌人。随着反独裁斗争的高涨，拉丁美洲反美情绪也日益增长。尼克松、杜勒斯和密·艾森豪威尔先后“访问”南美之受到驱逐、殴打和咒骂，就是最好的说明。
    反独裁反美斗争的复杂性
    拉丁美洲人民反独裁反美斗争虽然在有人民群众特别是工人阶级的积极参加和支持下，不断取得了胜利，但是，美帝国主义仍在利用它在拉丁美洲造成的经济依赖性和收买的反动势力，进行各种干涉和颠复活动，破坏反独裁斗争的胜利果实。同时，由于独裁政权被推翻的形式、各国人民运动发展的程度以及爱国民主力量和反动投降力量的对比等等的不同，这些国家的反独裁斗争和巩固胜利果实的斗争的进程，具有一定的曲折性和复杂性。
    目前在取得反独裁斗争胜利的国家里，维护独立、发展民主和争取经济的发展的斗争，依然是十分艰巨的。在委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚，新政府采取了一些民主和保卫民族利益的措施，共产党也恢复了合法地位。但尼加拉瓜和危地马拉的情况就大大不同。还有一些国家，如阿根廷，在弗朗迪西竞选总统时曾提出了一个符合人民和民族利益的竞选纲领，1958年5月就职后也还采取了一些民主措施，但是后来由于美帝国主义和国内反动派借阿根廷经济困难的机会，大施压力，以致最近一个时期，弗朗迪西政府右倾倒退，对外指望美国度过经济困难，对内开始向坚决保卫国家石油资源和维护国内民主的工人阶级和共产党进攻。
    面对着拉丁美洲民主民族运动的发展和亲美卖国独裁政权的纷纷垮台，美帝国主义是并不甘心的。正像拉丁美洲国家共产党在1958年12月发表的联合宣言所指出的，“帝国主义及其代理人企图阻挠这一过程的发展；用全力来保持一些采取恐怖活动的政府；使那些依宪法行事的政府的活动发生困难；保持和加深各国宪法政权的不稳定性；并像他们在危地马拉所干的那样阴谋制造政变，企图进行罪恶的干涉活动；怂恿对工人阶级和最坚决的爱国者进行新的迫害”。但是，在东风压倒西风的总的国际形势下，民族独立运动已成了不可阻挡的历史潮流。美帝国主义和一切反动派的再捣乱，只能激起拉丁美洲人民更加提高觉悟，更坚决地团结起来坚持斗争，使美帝国主义及其代理人遭到新的更大的失败。
