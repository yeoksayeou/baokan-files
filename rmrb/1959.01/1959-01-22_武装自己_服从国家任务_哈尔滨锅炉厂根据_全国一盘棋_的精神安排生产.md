Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 21st - The Harbin Boiler Plant, proceeding from the viewpoint of "the whole country as one chessboard," ensures the completion of key national products first, and then manufactures equipment to arm itself. Currently, all employees of the plant are concentrating all their efforts to guarantee the production of fourteen sets of power station boilers within January and February to support the great construction of the power industry.

The second-phase expansion project of the Harbin Boiler Plant will be put into production in the second half of the year. All kinds of equipment needed for the new workshops are manufactured by the plant itself, as long as they are capable. However, when arranging this year's production tasks, the plant did not decide to arm itself first. Instead, proceeding from the viewpoint of "the whole country as one chessboard," it arranged the plant's production tasks in different levels. Boilers needed for the great construction of the national power industry (i.e., important components such as steam drums and tubes), valves and auxiliary equipment for the boilers, water treatment equipment for the boilers, and collaborative products to support the production of boilers in fraternal boiler plants, petroleum containers and chemical equipment produced for fraternal plants, as well as temporary tasks and miscellaneous orders given by relevant departments at the higher level, are all guaranteed to be completed with priority; for equipment to arm ourselves, we try our best to seize the gaps and rush to install urgently needed ones; for those not urgently needed, we postpone them temporarily.

In the first quarter of production, the first batch of key tasks is to ensure the completion of fourteen sets of power station boilers. At present, the plant has organized relevant personnel to check the completion of boiler supporting tasks in various workshops. In addition, the Harbin Boiler Plant also produces boiler steam drums for boiler plants in Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing, Liaoning and other places. They also give priority to these important collaborative products. The first steam drum made by this plant for its new 280-ton boiler last December has recently been sent to the Shanghai Boiler Plant, so that fraternal plants can assemble the boilers into complete sets first.

In terms of material usage, this plant also prioritizes good materials for boiler supporting tasks, and makes full use of waste materials for equipment to arm itself.

    “武装自己”服从国家任务
    哈尔滨锅炉厂根据“全国一盘棋”的精神安排生产
    据新华社哈尔滨21日电　哈尔滨锅炉厂从“全国一盘棋”的观点出发，保证先完成国家重点产品、后制造武装自己的设备。目前，全厂职工正在集中一切力量，保证在一、二月内生产出十四台成套电站锅炉，支援电力工业大建设。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂二期扩建工程在下半年就要投入生产。新建车间所需要的各种设备，凡是自己能做的全由自己制造。但是，这个厂在安排今年的生产任务时，却没有决定先武装自己，而是从“全国一盘棋”的观点出发，将全厂生产任务分级作了安排。对国家电力工业大建设需要的锅炉本体（即汽包、管子等重要部件），锅炉配套用的阀门和辅助设备，锅炉的水处理设备及支援兄弟锅炉厂生产锅炉的协作产品，为兄弟厂生产的石油容器和化工设备等，以及上级有关部门给的临时任务和零星订货，都保证优先完成；对武装自己的设备，凡急需的，尽量抽空隙赶装；不急需的，暂时推后进行。
    在第一季度的生产中，首批重点任务是保证完成十四台成套的电站锅炉。目前，这个厂已组织了有关人员清查各车间完成锅炉配套任务的情况。此外，哈尔滨锅炉厂还为上海、武汉、天津、北京、辽宁等地的锅炉厂生产锅炉汽包。对于这些重要的协作产品，他们也都优先作了安排。去年12月这个厂为自己新制成的二百八十吨锅炉做的第一个汽包，最近已发往上海锅炉厂，让兄弟厂先把锅炉配装成套。
    这个厂在材料使用上也是好材料首先用在锅炉配套任务上，武装自己的设备充分利用废料。
