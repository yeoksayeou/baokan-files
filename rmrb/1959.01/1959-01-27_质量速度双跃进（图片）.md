    Double Leap in Quality and Speed
    The first phase of a thermal power plant in Shenyang, with a total generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts, is under intensive construction. The people building this thermal power plant have overcome the numerous difficulties of winter construction, achieving a double leap in project quality and speed. A 65-meter-high water tower was built in just 35 days; the structural engineering of the 2,500-square-meter three-story mixed-structure main control room was completed in only ten days. These projects were not only completed quickly but also guaranteed quality.
    Currently, various projects are progressing rapidly, and it is expected that the civil engineering will be completed around the Spring Festival.　Xinhua News Agency reporter Xiao Ye

    质量速度双跃进
    沈阳市一座总发电量为二十万瓩的热电站第一期工程，正在加紧施工。建设这座热电站的人们，克服了冬季施工的重重困难，使工程质量、速度双跃进。一座六十五公尺高的水塔，仅用三十五天时间就建成了；二千五百平方公尺的三层混合结构主控制室的结构工程，仅用十天就建成了。这些工程不仅完成的快，而且保证了质量。
    目前各项工程正在飞速的进展中，预计春节前后可以完成土建工程。　新华社记者　肖野摄
