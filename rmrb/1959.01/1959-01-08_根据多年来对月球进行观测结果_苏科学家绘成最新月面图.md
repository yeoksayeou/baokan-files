Xinhua News Agency, January 7th, Leningrad dispatch: According to TASS, Leningrad geologist and selenologist Khabakov has drawn the latest lunar map with a scale of 1:1,500,000.

The new lunar map is based on the results of Khabakov's many years of observations of the Moon at the Pulkovo Observatory and the Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory. The map uses different colors to mark the epochs of formation of various undulating shapes on the lunar surface. The drawer also determined the alternation of orogenic periods and shorter periods of formation of huge marine depressions on the moon.

The drawer told TASS reporters that there is basically no orogenic activity on the moon now. Before that, there was the so-called Copernican period of lunar ring mountain formation, and earlier there was the so-called "Marine Period," when most of the major lunar depressions were formed. Before that, even earlier, there was a long orogenic period, during which the "Alphonsus" ring mountain, where Soviet scientist Kozyrev recently discovered gas eruptions, was formed.

When talking about the geological period of the development of the lunar surface topography with many ring mountains, Khabakov said that if it is considered to be caused by volcanic processes, it would take 150 to 200 million years; if it is considered to be caused by huge meteorites (and such large meteorites would only be encountered once or twice in a thousand years), it would take no less than tens of millions of years.

Khabakov finally said that in the future, more detailed lunar maps will be drawn, which are necessary for spacecraft landing on the moon. (Attached pictures)

### 根据多年来对月球进行观测结果  苏科学家绘成最新月面图

    根据多年来对月球进行观测结果
    苏科学家绘成最新月面图
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒消息：列宁格勒的地质学和月面学家哈巴科夫绘制成了比例尺为一百五十万分之一的最新月面图。
    新的月面图是根据哈巴科夫在普尔科沃天文台和阿巴斯图曼天体物理天文台多年来对月球进行观测的结果绘制的。图上用不同的颜色标出了月面各种起伏形状形成的年代。绘制者还确定了月球上曾有过造山时期和较短的巨大海洋洼地形成期的交替。
    绘制者对塔斯社记者说，月球上现在已基本上没有造山活动，在这之前曾有过月球寰形山形成的所谓哥白尼时期，再早便是所谓“海洋纪”，主要的月球洼地大多数都是那时形成的，而在此以前，更早的时候则是一个长的造山时期，最近苏联科学家科齐列夫发现有气体喷出现象的“阿尔芬斯”寰形山就是在这时形成的。
    哈巴科夫在谈到具有许多寰形山的月球表面地形发展的地质时期时说，如果认为这是火山过程造成，则需要一亿五千万到两亿年，如果认为是由巨大的陨石造成（而这种大陨石一千年中不过只会遇到一两次），那就该不少于几千万年。
    哈巴科夫最后说，今后还将绘制为宇宙飞船在月球着陆所必需的更详尽的月面图。（附图片）
