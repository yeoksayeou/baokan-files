	Insoluble at High Temperatures, Non-Freezing at Low Temperatures
	Shanghai Star Household Chemical Factory has recently produced two new types of high-grade fragrant creams, "Friendship" and "44776." Both creams are made from high-grade raw materials, with a delicate texture, bright color, and stable emulsification. They do not exude oil at high temperatures of 103° Fahrenheit and remain soft and non-freezing in severe cold below zero degrees. They are a superior product for winter cold protection and skin care.

    高温不溶　低温不冻
    上海明星家用化学厂，最近生产“友谊”、“44776”两种新型高级香脂。这两种香脂都采用高级原料制成，质地细腻、色泽光亮、乳化稳定。在华氏103°的高温下，膏体不走油；在零度以下的严寒，仍柔软不冻。它是冬令抗寒护肤的上等品。（附图片）
