Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 15th:

    According to the Vietnam News Agency, Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the State Planning Committee of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said in an interview with a Vietnam News Agency reporter that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had successfully completed the 1958 national plan.
    Nguyen Van Tran said that in agriculture, although the summer crops in North Vietnam were severely affected by drought in 1958, the autumn crops were particularly good. Therefore, the total rice production reached 4,574,650 tons, exceeding the plan by 12.2%, an increase of 15.9% compared with 1957, and an increase of 90% compared with 1939.
    He pointed out that although South Vietnam's planting area is 500,000 hectares larger than North Vietnam's, its rice production is 3.5 million tons less than North Vietnam's.
    Nguyen Van Tran said that North Vietnam's cash crops overfulfilled the plan in 1958. Progress has also been made in livestock breeding.
    He said that the agricultural cooperation movement developed greatly in 1958. The plan stipulated that 60% of farmers should participate in mutual aid teams, but by the end of 1958, 65% of farmers had participated in mutual aid teams. The plan stipulated the establishment of 240 agricultural cooperatives, but now 4,721 have been established.
    Nguyen Van Tran said that the industrial plan was also completed satisfactorily. The total industrial output value exceeded the plan by 3.3%, an increase of 40% compared with 1957. Labor productivity increased by 2% compared with the plan and 25% compared with 1957.
    Coal overfulfilled the plan by 4.8%, cement overfulfilled by 4%, fertilizer overfulfilled by 60.5%, apatite overfulfilled by 15.6%, ferrochrome overfulfilled by 27%, tin overfulfilled by 23.8%, and fabrics overfulfilled by 3.6%.
    He said that the basic construction situation in North Vietnam in 1958 was better than in 1957. The construction appropriation for industrial enterprises reached 8 billion Vietnamese Dong (approximately 20 million US dollars), while the estimated figure at the beginning of the year was 7 billion Vietnamese Dong.
    In education, the number of university students was 5,590, exceeding the original plan by 10%. The 5,185 general schools had a total of 1,117,000 students, an increase of 27% compared with 1957. The main achievement in this area was the improvement of the quality of teachers and students in accordance with the principles of building socialist schools.
    In terms of health work, the main efforts were to prevent diseases and eliminate epidemics left over from the old society. No infectious diseases occurred in North Vietnam last year.
    In terms of improving people's living standards, the government reduced the prices of major consumer goods by about 5%, vigorously stabilized the market, fought against hoarding and speculation, provided the people with sufficient commodities, and increased workers' wages by 13%, all of which further improved the people's living conditions.
    When talking about the reasons for the successful implementation of the 1958 plan by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Nguyen Van Tran pointed out that this was because the working masses, the army, and other classes of people in North Vietnam, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, had great enthusiasm and determination to build socialism in North Vietnam as the foundation for a unified motherland.
    Nguyen Van Tran said that the successful completion of the 1958 plan is a huge encouragement to the implementation of the 1959 plan, and 1959 is a crucial year in Vietnam's three-year plan (1958-1960) for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture.

    越南去年国家计划胜利完成
    工业总产值增加百分之四十　秋稻大丰收
    新华社河内15日电　据越南通讯社消息：越南民主共和国国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍在接见越南通讯社记者时说，越南民主共和国已经胜利完成1958年的国家计划。
    阮文珍说，在农业方面，虽然1958年北越的夏季作物受到旱灾的严重影响，可是秋季作物收成特别好，因此，水稻总产量达到了四百五十七万四千六百五十吨，超过计划12.2％，比1957年增加15.9％，比1939年增加90％。
    他指出，虽然南越的种植面积比北越多五十万公顷，它的水稻产量却比北越少三百五十万吨。
    阮文珍说，1958年越南北方经济作物超额完成了计划。在牲畜饲养方面也取得了进展。
    他说，1958年农业合作化运动有很大的发展。计划规定60％农户参加变工组，但是到1958年底，有65％的农户参加了变工组。计划规定建立二百四十个农业合作社，但现在建立了四千七百二十一个。
    阮文珍说，工业计划也令人满意地完成了。工业总产值超过计划3.3％，比1957年增加40％。劳动生产率比计划提高2％，比1957年提高25％。
    煤超额完成计划4.8％，水泥超额完成4％，肥料超额完成60.5％，磷灰石超额完成15.6％，铬铁超额完成27％，锡超额完成23.8％，布匹超额完成3.6％。
    他说，1958年越南北方的基本建设情况比1957年更好。工业企业的建筑拨款达八百亿元
  （约合两千万美元），而在这一年初的预计数字是七百亿元。
    在教育方面，大学生数目是五千五百九十人，比原来计划超过10％。五千一百八十五所普通学校共有学生一百十一万七千人，比1957年增加了27％。这方面的主要成就是按照建设社会主义学校的方针，提高了教师和学生的质量。
    在卫生工作方面，主要是努力预防疾病和消灭旧社会遗留下来的流行病。越南北方去年没有发生过一次传染病。
    在改善人民生活方面，政府把主要消费品的价格降低了5％左右，大力稳定市场，同囤积投机作斗争，对人民提供足够的商品以及工人工资提高13％等，都使人民的生活条件得到了进一步的改善。
    阮文珍在谈到越南民主共和国成功地实现1958年计划的原因时指出，这是由于越南北方劳动群众、军队以及其它阶层的人民在越南劳动党领导下，有巨大的热情和决心在越南北方建设社会主义作为统一祖国的基础。
    阮文珍说，1958年计划的胜利完成，对于1959年计划的贯彻是一种巨大的鼓舞力量，而1959年是越南发展和改造经济、发展文化三年计划
  （1958—1690年）中具有关键性的一年。
