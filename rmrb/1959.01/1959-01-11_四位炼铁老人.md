Four Old Iron Smelters

On the iron and steel front in Dadenggou, under the Helan Mountains, in the Lingwu Brigade, there are four Hui Muslim old men: Ma Yilong, Ma Zhanhai, Bai Junde, and Yang Shengyi. They are all over fifty years old, but when they work, they are full of enthusiasm and energy.

Last October, after they joined the iron and steel expedition team on the mountain, the headquarters assigned them to the Fifth Squad. When the two young men from the Fifth Squad, Xiao Liu and Shenwa, heard that four old men were coming to their team, they said to Captain He Shengzhi:
"How can this work? Assigning old men to us, how can we complete the task?" Before they could finish speaking, the old men, who were coming out of the kiln, happened to hear them. At this time, the old man Ma Yilong jokingly suggested to Captain He: "Please, Captain, assign the four of us old men to one furnace and compete with these young men." As he said this, he said to Xiao Liu and Shenwa: "Young men, dare you accept the challenge?" Xiao Liu and Shenwa replied nonchalantly: "A competition is a competition. What's there to be afraid of?"

The competition began, and the old men loaded the furnace and lit the fire in less than the time it takes to eat a meal. This furnace produced 740 jin of iron. However, they were not satisfied and asked the leaders to add another furnace. From then on, their enthusiasm became even greater. Once, just after the furnace had stopped firing, the temperature inside the furnace was very high, and the heat was overwhelming. But in order to rush to load the next furnace, the old man Ma Yilong still jumped into the furnace several times to take out the iron. When their third iron output reached 848 jin, Xiao Liu and Shenwa, like many young people, came to the four old men's furnace and earnestly said, "Old heroes, please tell us young people about your iron smelting experience!"

    四位炼铁老人
    在贺兰山下大磴沟钢铁阵地上，灵武大队有四位回民老汉。他们是：马义龙、马占海、柏俊德、杨生义。他们都已年过五十，干起活来却是情绪饱满，精神焕发。
    去年10月，他们参加钢铁远征军上山以后，指挥部把他们分给第五中队。第五中队的小刘、伸娃两个小伙子听说四个老汉要到他们队里，就对队长何生智说：
  “这怎么行呢？把上了年纪的老汉分给我们，那叫我们怎么完成任务？”他们的话还没说完，恰好被从窑里走出来的老汉们听到了。这时马义龙老汉饶有风趣地笑着向何队长提议说：“请队长把我们四个老汉分到一个炉子，和这些小伙子们比赛。”说着就向小刘、伸娃说：“小伙子敢应战吗？”小刘和伸娃满不在乎的回答：“比赛就比赛吧，有啥不敢应战的。”
    比赛开始了，老汉们不到一顿饭的工夫就装好炉子点了火。这一炉出铁七百四十斤。但是，他们并不满足，又向领导要求增加了一个炉。从此他们的干劲更大了，有一次炉刚刚停火，炉内温度很高，热气逼人，但为了赶装下一炉，马义龙老汉还是几次跳下炉内取铁。当他们第三次出铁达到八百四十八斤时，小刘和伸娃和许多青年人一样，来到四位老汉的炉旁恳切地说：“老英雄们，把你们的炼铁经验，给我们青年人讲讲吧！”　　　（曹希彬）
