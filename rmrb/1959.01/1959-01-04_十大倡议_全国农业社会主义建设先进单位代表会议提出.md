Ten Initiatives
Proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction

	(1) Guarantee the completion of the 1959 grain production target of 1,050 billion jin and strive to exceed it. In general areas, strive to achieve an average of 2,000 jin of grain per capita for urban and rural residents. In some areas, more than 2,000 jin may be necessary depending on needs. In areas with difficult conditions, this standard can be reached within 1959 and 1960.

	(2) Guarantee the completion of the 1959 production target of 100 million dan of ginned cotton and strive to exceed it.
	Guarantee that the production of oilseed crops and hemp will have greater development in 1959. Make every effort to ensure that the edible vegetable oil produced from oilseed crops in 1959, excluding those not used for oil extraction, increases by one time compared to 1958, reaching at least 6 million tons (i.e., 12 billion jin). The production of kenaf and ramie should reach 20 million dan.
	Sugar crops, tobacco leaves, silk, tea, other various industrial raw material crops, and subtropical crops must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the increased production targets stipulated by the state.

	(3) Conscientiously do a good job in the field management of wheat, rapeseed, and other overwintering crops, apply topdressing fertilizer, water diligently, and eliminate third-class seedlings. Carry out winter water conservancy, soil and water conservation, deep plowing to improve soil, and winter manure accumulation campaigns. Vigorously engage in winter sideline production to increase the cash income of the communes. Ensure the safe overwintering of livestock. Do a good job in all preparations for early rice and other spring-sown crops. Striving for a bumper harvest of summer-harvested crops and early rice is the first battle to achieve a greater bumper harvest in 1959, and must be grasped firmly to ensure victory.

	(4) Seriously implement the "soil, fertilizer, water, seed, density, protection, tools, management" eight-character charter. Implement garden-style cultivation, universally increase yield per unit area, and carry out a large-scale high-yield field campaign. This is the key to achieving a greater bumper harvest in 1959. Each people's commune should cultivate high-yield fields, the area of which should account for about 20% of the sown area, and the yield per mu should be more than twice the average yield per mu.

	(5) Comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. While increasing the production of grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other various industrial raw material crops, comprehensively arrange labor to develop forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline production. It is required that the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in 1959 should increase by about one time compared to 1958.
	In terms of animal husbandry, every people's commune should conscientiously carry out the campaign to achieve full fat and full pregnancy. The net increase rate of large livestock in 1959 is required to reach about 10%. For pigs and sheep, it is necessary to ensure a certain net increase rate and a certain market supply. Pigs must be fattened, ensuring that the slaughtered fat pigs weigh no less than 150 jin per head, and the number of slaughtered heads will be calculated according to this standard. For the production of chickens, ducks, eggs, aquatic products, and vegetables, each people's commune should make unified arrangements according to the conditions, taking into account the needs of the commune members and urban people for non-staple foods, and regard the supply of non-staple foods to cities as their glorious task.

	(6) Implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. People's communes and county-level cooperative associations should, according to different conditions, allocate a certain amount of labor to vigorously run industries. The industrial output value of people's communes and county-level cooperative associations in 1959 should increase by at least one time compared to 1958.

	(7) Implement the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production. People's communes should develop commodity production, and the output value of commodities in 1959 should increase by about one time compared to 1958. People's communes should manage well the rural commercial organizations and banks that have been decentralized, do a good job in the purchase of rural products and the sale of industrial products, and develop rural commerce.
	People's communes should actively establish rural transportation networks, build roads and bridges, dredge rivers, and develop transportation by vehicles and ships to facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and accelerate the development of the socialist economy.

	(8) Improve the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production. The public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly and other welfare undertakings of the people's communes must be run well. Ensure the implementation of the regulations of eight hours of sleep and four hours of eating and rest, as well as the special regulations on the protection of women, pregnant women, lying-in women, and breastfeeding mothers, so that commune members eat well, sleep well, raise their children well, feel happy, and have greater enthusiasm, which will provide a greater guarantee for achieving a greater leap forward in 1959.

	(9) Strive for a greater leap forward in science, culture, education, health, and sports. Continue to carry out the literacy campaign. Develop commune-run primary schools so that all school-age children can enroll. Consolidate and improve agricultural middle schools. Run red and expert schools well. On the basis of combining scientific research with mass production, further carry out scientific research work in rural areas. Carry out mass cultural and artistic activities such as drama and dance according to the needs and willingness of commune members. Continue to vigorously carry out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and sports activities to improve people's health.

	(10) Seize the next few months, closely combine with winter production, and rectify and consolidate people's communes. Conscientiously study the Central Committee's resolution on several issues concerning people's communes, unify understanding, improve thinking, do a good job in production, do a good job in life, do a good job in the operation and management of people's communes, establish responsibility systems, implement economic accounting, practice thrift, oppose extravagance and waste; and be sure to closely rely on the leadership of the Party, implement political leadership, promote democratic style and realistic style, so that people's communes are run better and better.

	Water: In 1957, China's irrigated area was only 520 million mu, accounting for 30.7% of the cultivated area; in 1958, it expanded to 1 billion mu, accounting for 59.5% of the cultivated area.
	Fertilizer: In 1957, the country accumulated a total of 33.6 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average application of 2,000 jin per mu; in 1958, it accumulated a total of 386 billion dan of fertilizer, with an application of 25,000 jin per mu.
	Soil: Across the country, during the spring planting and summer sowing in 1958, 120 million mu of land were deep-plowed; from the autumn of 1958 to the spring of 1959, it was planned to deep-plow 1.2 billion mu, and by the end of last year, about 800 million mu had been deep-plowed.
	Seed: In 1957, the planting area of improved varieties was 1.23 billion mu, accounting for 55.9% of the crop sowing area; in 1958, the area of improved varieties was 1.8 billion mu, accounting for 75.8% of the crop area.
	Density: According to surveys, in fields with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu, wheat was sown at 18 to 40 jin per mu, with more than 400,000 to 600,000 ears per mu; rice was transplanted with more than 30,000 seedlings per mu, with more than 400,000 ears per mu.
	Protection: In 1958, a total of 1.84 billion mu of various crops were protected from pests and diseases, an increase of one and a half times compared to 1957.
	Tools: Great achievements in agricultural tool reform: more than 420,000 creations and inventions, and more than 349 million pieces promoted and used.
	Management: Universally strengthening field management in stages was the key to the unprecedented bumper grain harvest in 1958.

    十大倡议
    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出
    （一）保证完成1959年粮食产量一万零五百亿斤的任务，并且力争超过。一般地区，力求做到按城乡人口平均每人有粮食两千斤。有些地方，根据需要可以多于两千斤。条件困难的地方，可以在1959和1960两年内达到这个标准。
    （二）保证完成1959年生产一亿担皮棉的任务，并且力争超过。
    保证油料作物的生产和麻类的生产在1959年都有更大的发展。想尽一切办法，使1959年所生产的油料作物，除了不用于榨油的以外，能够生产的食用植物油比1958年增加一倍，至少达到六百万吨（即一百二十亿斤）。黄洋麻和苎麻的产量达到二千万担。
    糖料、烟叶、丝、茶、其他各种工业原料作物和亚热带作物，都要保证完成和超额完成国家所规定的增产指标。
    （三）切实做好小麦、油菜和其他过冬作物的田间管理，施追肥，勤浇水，消灭三类苗。开展冬修水利、水土保持、深翻改良土壤和冬季积肥运动。大搞冬季副业生产，增加公社的现金收入。保证牲畜安全过冬。做好早稻和其他春播作物的一切备耕工作。争取夏收作物和早稻的大丰收，是实现1959年更大丰收的第一仗，必须抓紧，保证胜利。
    （四）认真执行“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八字宪法。实行耕作园田化，普遍提高单位面积产量，开展大面积高产田运动。这是实现1959年更大丰收的关键。各个人民公社都要培植高产田，面积应该占播种面积的20％左右，亩产量应该比平均亩产量高一倍以上。
    （五）农林牧副渔全面发展。在增产粮食、棉花、油料和其他各种工业原料作物的同时，要全面安排劳动力，发展林业、牧业、渔业和副业生产。要求1959年林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的产值比1958年增加一倍左右。
    在畜牧业方面，每一个人民公社都要认真开展满膘、满怀运动。大家畜1959年的净增率要求达到10％左右。猪、羊既要保证一定的净增率，又要保证一定的上市量，猪要喂肥，保证杀的肥猪，每头毛重不少于一百五十斤，以后就按这个标准，来折算屠宰的头数。鸡鸭、蛋品、水产和蔬菜等生产，每一个人民公社都要根据条件统一安排，要兼顾公社社员和城市人民副食品的需要，并且把供应城市副食品当做自己的光荣任务。
    （六）实行工业和农业同时并举。人民公社和县联社都要根据不同的条件，抽出一定的劳动力来大办工业。人民公社和县联社1959年的工业产值至少要比1958年增加一倍。
    （七）实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。人民公社要发展商品生产，商品的产值1959年要比1958年增加一倍左右。人民公社要把下放的农村商业机构和银行管理好，做好农村产品的收购工作和工业产品的销售工作，发展农村商业。
    人民公社要积极建立农村交通运输网，修路架桥，疏浚河道，发展车运船运，便利城乡物资交流，加速社会主义经济的发展。
    （八）在发展生产的基础上，改善群众生活。人民公社的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院等生活福利事业，必须办好。保证实行睡觉八小时和吃饭休息四小时的规定。以及关于保护妇女、孕妇、产妇和哺乳的母亲的特殊规定，使社员吃好饭，睡好觉，带好孩子，心情舒畅，干劲更大，实现1959年更大的跃进也就更有保证。
    （九）争取科学、文化、教育、卫生和体育事业更大的跃进。继续开展扫盲运动。发展社办小学，让学龄儿童都入学读书。巩固提高农业中学。办好红专学校。在科学研究和群众生产结合的基础上，进一步开展农村中的科学研究工作。按照公社社员的需要和自愿，开展群众性的戏剧、歌舞等等文化艺术活动。继续大力进行以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动和体育活动，增进人民的健康。
    （十）抓紧最近几个月的时间，密切结合冬季生产，整顿巩固人民公社。认真学习中央关于人民公社若干问题的决议，统一认识，提高思想，搞好生产，搞好生活，搞好人民公社的经营管理，建立责任制度，实行经济核算，厉行节约，反对铺张浪费；并且一定要紧密依靠党的领导，实行政治挂帅，发扬民主作风和实事求是的作风，使人民公社愈办愈好。（附图片）
