Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th Dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said in Osaka today that negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will enter a "substantial" stage starting at the end of January. He believes that the Japan-U.S. negotiations have "fallen behind the scheduled plan" at this stage.

Fujiyama Aiichiro said that he intends to sign the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the United States at the end of March.

Fujiyama revealed that in the future Japan-U.S. negotiations, the central issue will be whether Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands are included in the treaty's applicable area. According to previously revealed information, the draft new military treaty between the United States and Japan stipulates that these islands are included in the treaty's applicable area, so that the United States can use Japan as an accomplice in aggression in a wide area of the Far East. However, this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people. At the same time, the entire conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to revise the "Security Treaty" has been severely hit by the resolute struggle of the Japanese people, and they have had to slow down their pace.

    坚持修改日美“安全条约”
    日美双方将重开谈判
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎今天在大阪发表谈话说，修改日美“安全条约”的谈判将从一月底起进入“实实在在”的阶段。他认为，日美谈判在现阶段已经“落后于预定的计划”。
    藤山爱一郎说，他打算在三月底和美国签署修改后的日美“安全条约”。
    藤山透露，在今后的日美谈判中，中心问题将是冲绳和小笠原群岛是否包括在条约适用地区。根据过去透露出来的消息，日美双方的新的军事条约草案都规定把这些岛屿包括在条约适用地区，以便美国在远东广泛地区利用日本充当侵略帮凶。但是，美日反动派的这种阴谋遭到日本人民的强烈反对。同时，美日反动派修改“安全条约”的整个阴谋，在日本人民的坚决斗争下，遭到沉重的打击，而不得不放慢步调。
