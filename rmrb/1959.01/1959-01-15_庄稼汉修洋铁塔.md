Five months ago, when people took the train south from Zhengzhou along the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, they saw nothing but weeds or continuous mountains along the 300-kilometer line in Henan Province. But now, it has changed. A brand-new railway – the Zhengzhou-Hankou Double Track – and bridges have sprung up.

The Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Zhengzhou-Hankou Double Track was originally planned to start construction in 1959 and be completed and open to traffic in 1960. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, this section of the railway became a narrow bottleneck in China's north-south transportation. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on this situation, decided to start construction ahead of schedule. In June of last year, each construction team set off for their work posts with heavy tasks.

Zhao Guangshun, the Party Secretary of the Fifth Engineering Team, and Sun Chunzhong, the Captain, who were assigned to Xuchang, felt very heavy-hearted. Because on the line from Zhengzhou to Luohe that they were responsible for building, the workers, materials, and machinery had not yet been settled. Just as they were in trouble, Comrade Zhao Tianxi, the First Secretary of the Xuchang Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, met with them.

Zhao Guangshun reported on the work to the Prefectural Committee, especially stating: "We will carry out the work under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office."

"That's very good." Comrade Zhao Tianxi then asked, "What are your plans?"

Zhao Guangshun rattled off a lot of specific issues such as land purchase and relocation, earthwork pricing, and labor allocation.

Comrade Zhao Tianxi said: "What I mean by how to do it is not these specific issues, because solving these problems is not very difficult. What I am asking is, are you going to mobilize a batch of labor to repair it yourselves, or will the local people repair it?"

Zhao Guangshun was overjoyed to hear this. He believed that the second method was better, as it would speed up the process and ensure quality. Therefore, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee decided to transfer 70,000 laborers to repair the railway. In just seven days, they completed nearly 100 kilometers of earthwork in the entire area, firing the first shot of the masses repairing the road. Then, the masses in Xinyang and Zhengzhou areas were also mobilized.

When the broad masses of the people heard that they were going to build a railway, everyone was overjoyed. They carried luggage, brought tools, and traveled across mountains and rivers from all directions to the railway line. Before they came, no one knew how to build bridges or roads, and some had never even seen a railway. But it was these people who used those simple tools to make the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way.

In the autumn, the old Wang Slope in Xiping County was a vast expanse of water. According to legend, the Tang Dynasty general Luo Cheng was trapped here and shot to death by arrows. However, today's heroic people are going to build a road here. Where to get the soil for road construction? The Old Wang Slope is surrounded by water and mud for twenty or thirty miles, and it must be picked up from thirty or forty miles away. How long will it take to pick it up? Later, they decided to dig ditches and build embankments to first drain the mud and water, dig out the silt, and then dig out the soil below, dry it in the sun, and then build the road. One day, in the fourth company of the Old Wang Slope camp, more than twenty young men in their teens were waving shovels to dig silt in the depression opposite Luo Cheng's tomb. The knee-deep silt sucked their legs like a magnet. Every time they dug for a while, they had to move their legs, otherwise they would sink. Every time they moved, their bodies had to lean forward and backward, and their whole bodies turned into mud men.

"These young men should be called the Luo Cheng Platoon!" people around were discussing.

"What? We are not called the Luo Cheng Platoon!" the young men said unhappily.

"Why?"

"Why? Luo Cheng was killed by the Old Wang Slope, but we conquered the Old Wang Slope, how can we compare with him?"

With one word, people understood: In front of today's heroes, what does Luo Cheng count for!

You can see such heroes everywhere on the construction site along the line. On the difficult section of one kilometer long between Zhoujiawan and Pengjiawan in northern Xinyang, although it was the coldest period of winter, the boiling labor life made the entire construction site feel warm. The migrant workers from Xincai County who built this section of the roadbed took off their cotton clothes and faced the north wind to cut mountains and fill ponds. The crowd transporting soil was endless. The migrant workers tamping the soil sang and danced, and seven or eight people lifted a large stone roller weighing more than 400 pounds high and slammed it heavily on the roadbed, making the earth rumble. On this construction site, there was a young migrant worker with broad shoulders and a wide body. He transported six baskets of soil at a time, weighing more than 300 pounds. He crossed a distance of 170 meters and climbed a steep slope of more than 20 meters, transporting 17 cubic meters of soil every day. This is the "Iron Tiger" Wang Faling. After Wang Faling came to the construction site, he was rated as a labor model four times. At a labor model meeting, the County Party Secretary stroked his healthy body and said in surprise: "No wonder you have such great strength!" Wang Faling said with a smile: "I want to use my strength to carry a railway!"

The roadbed is built, but if the bridge is not built, it cannot be opened to traffic even if the rails are laid. At this time, the Henan Provincial Railway Construction Headquarters called on the entire army to fight against this "stumbling block" and launch a mass bridge construction movement.

Because the masses were relied upon, not only did each construction site complete the construction of small bridges and culverts ahead of schedule, but also built large bridges at lightning speed. When building the 205-meter-long Shi River Bridge, there was only one technician who graduated from a secondary technical school, one foreman, and two road workers who understood the technology; there were no materials either. Some elderly people in the local area heard that these people were going to lead the migrant workers to build the bridge and shook their heads and said: "How many years will it take to do this?" Because they had seen five French engineers, as well as many technicians and foremen, come to build the old Shi River Bridge. A large number of machinery and materials were transported. It took them twenty-one months to build the bridge. Indeed, there were not many technicians to build the new bridge, but they resolutely relied on the masses and established a construction committee, and everyone thought of ways to solve problems. If there were no materials, the masses were mobilized to collect them; if there were no skilled workers, those who had worked as bricklayers and carpenters in the past were organized and trained to pour concrete and build rubble masonry. In this way, in just two months, they basically completed the main project of the bridge.

The track laying work has begun. Because of the eagerness to open to traffic, Guo Chunying, a girl from Lin ying County who participated in the road construction, asked the leaders to allow women to participate in spiking the tracks. After the leadership approved, they formed a women's spiking track company. Guo Chunying became the company commander. Guo Chunying is a road construction model worker. As soon as she organized the women's spiking track company, she went to Zhengzhou Railway Administration to attend a meeting. Seven days later, when she came back, she saw that all the women in the company were spiking the tracks there, and the hammers were hitting accurately and steadily; the road workers who were guiding them praised them repeatedly. The rapid progress of the whole company of women's spiking track skills made her feel that spiking track was easy. However, after studying for half a day, she often couldn't hold the hammer steady, either hitting the nail crooked or hitting the rails.

"It seems that I am the dumbest," she complained to herself.

"No, it's still not enough effort." Pei Jiujie, Li Rang? and others who helped her practice said in unison. While they were practicing, every night they hammered a spike into a broken sleeper and pulled it out again.... Guo Chunying used their method to practice hard for more than a day, and caught up with them in technology.

Now, the double-track project is about to be completed, and the road construction army is returning to the countryside one after another, fully loaded with honor and harvest. Many farmers have become labor models, joined the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, and at the same time mastered earthwork construction, bridge and culvert construction, and track laying and spiking skills. This batch of strength will become the backbone of Henan Province's future construction of crisscrossing railway networks. (Attached picture)

Before the water pump was transported to the construction site, the migrant workers in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, used a large number of waterwheels to pump dry the lakes and ponds on the line.

    庄稼汉修洋铁塔
    本报记者　陆笑萍　郝健
    五个月以前，当人们从郑州乘火车沿着京广铁路南行的时候，在河南境内三百多公里的线路两旁，看到的不是杂草丛生，就是山岭连绵。可是，现在却变样了。一条崭新的铁路——郑汉复线的路基和一座座的桥梁，已经生长起来。
    京广铁路郑汉复线原计划1959年动工兴建，1960年建成通车。随着工农业生产的大跃进，这段铁路成为我国南北交通的狭窄地带。中共郑州铁路局党委根据这种情况，决定提前开工兴建。去年6月，各工程队便带着繁重的任务纷纷奔上了工作岗位。
    派到许昌去的第五工程队的党委书记赵广顺、队长孙纯忠，心情非常沉重。因为在他们负责修建的从郑州到漯河的线路上，工人、材料、机具还没有着落。正在为难之际，中共许昌地委第一书记赵天锡同志接见了他们。
    赵广顺向地委汇报了工作，特别说明：“我们要在地委、专署的统一领导、统一布置下进行工作。”
    “这很好。”赵天锡同志接着问：“你们打算怎么干法呢？”
    赵广顺一口气就把购地迁移、土方作价、劳动调配等具体问题谈了一大堆。
    赵天锡同志说：“我所说的怎样干，不是指的这些具体问题，因为解决这些问题并不很困难。我所提的怎么干，是调一批劳力你们自己去修呢？还是由地方来修？”
    赵广顺听完这段话，心里乐得开了花。他认为第二种办法比较好，这样既可以加快速度，又可以保证质量。于是，许昌地委决定抽调七万劳动力去修铁路。只干了七天，就完成了全区近一百公里的土方工程，打响了群众修路的第一炮。接着，信阳和郑州地区的群众也动员起来了。
    广大人民群众一听说要修铁路，个个兴高彩烈。他们挑着行李，带着工具，跋山涉水，从四面八方奔赴铁路沿线。他们在未来之前，谁也不知道怎样架桥，修路，甚至有的连铁路也没有见过。但是，就是这些人，用了那些简单的工具，便使高山低了头，河水让了路。
    秋天，西平县境内的老王坡，一片汪洋。相传唐朝的大将罗成因在这里陷身，被箭射死。可是，今天的英雄人民要在这里修路。修路，到哪里去取土呢？老王坡周围二、三十里到处是水是泥，必须到三、四十里以外去挑，这要挑到何年何月呢？后来，他们决定挖沟筑堰，先排除泥水，挖掉淤泥，再把下面的土挖出来，晒干以后再来筑路。有一天，老王坡营四连，有二十多个十七、八岁的小伙子挥舞着铁锨，在罗成坟对面的洼地里挖淤泥。没膝深的淤泥，像磁石一样吸着他们的两腿。每挖一会，就要把腿挪动一下，不然就会陷下去。每当挪动的时候，身体要前倾后仰，混身变成了泥人。
    “他们这群小伙子可该叫罗成排啊！”周围的人们在议论着。
    “什么？咱们才不叫罗成排呢！”小伙子们很不高兴地说。
    “为啥？”
    “为啥？罗成被老王坡害死了，咱们却治服了老王坡，这怎能与他相比呢？”
    一言道破，人们明白了：在今天我们的英雄面前，罗成又算得什么！
    像这样的英雄，你在沿线工地上到处都可以见到。在信阳北边周家湾到彭家湾间一公里长的难工地段上，虽然已是数九寒天，沸腾的劳动生活使整个工地感到温暖。修建这段路基的新蔡县的民工，脱掉棉衣，迎着北风在削山填塘。运土的人群川流不息。打夯的民工唱着跳着，七、八个人把一个四百多斤重的大石磙高高举起，狠狠地打在路基上，把大地震得轰轰作响。就在这个工地上，有一个膀大身宽的青年民工，他一次运土六筐，重达三百多斤。他越过一百七十公尺的距离，爬上二十多公尺的陡坡，每天运土十七方。这就是“铁老虎”王法岭。王法岭来到工地以后，四次被评为劳动模范。在一次劳模会上，县委书记抚摸着他的健康的身体惊喜地说：“怪不得你有这样大的力气！”王法岭笑着说：“我要用我的力气，担出一条铁路来呢！”
    路基修筑好了，桥梁没有修，就是铺上铁轨也不能通车。这时候，河南省修建铁路总指挥部号召全线大军大战这个“拦路虎”，开展群众性的修桥运动。
    由于依靠了群众，各工地不但提前完成了小桥涵的建筑工程，而且神速地建起了一座座的大桥。在建筑二百零五公尺长的溮河大桥的时候，懂技术的只有一个中等技术学校毕业的技术员，一个工长，两个路工；材料也没有。当地一些老年人听说就是这些人要领着民工修大桥，摇着头说：“这要做到哪一年呀？”因为他们过去看到在建旧线溮河大桥的时候，曾来了五个法国工程师，还有很多技术员，领工员。机具、材料运来了一大批。他们花了二十一个月的时间，才把大桥修成。修建新大桥，的确技术人员不多，但是他们坚决依靠了群众，建立了施工委员会，有问题大家想办法解决。没有材料，发动群众搜集；没有技术工人，就把过去做过瓦工、木工的人组织起来，经过训练，分别去浇灌混凝土，砌片石。就是这样，仅仅两个月的时间，他们就基本上完成了大桥的主体工程。
    铺轨工作开始了。由于盼望通车心切，临颖县参加修路的一位姑娘郭春英要求领导方面让妇女参加钉道。领导批准以后，她们成立了一个妇女钉道连。郭春英当连长。郭春英是修路模范。她把妇女钉道连一组织好，就到郑州铁路管理局开会去了。七天以后，她回来的时候，看到全连的妇女，正在那里钉道，铁锤打得又准又稳；指导她们工作的路工在旁边连连称赞不已。全连妇女钉道技术的飞快进步，使她产生了钉道容易的错觉。可是，当她学习了半天以后，铁锤还是常常把握不住，不是打歪了钉，就是碰上了铁轨。
    “看样子，就数我笨了。”她埋怨自己道。
    “不，还是不到功夫。”帮助她练习的裴九姐、李让?等人都异口同声地说。在她们练习的时候，每天晚上在破枕木上面，把一根道钉打下去，又拔起来……。郭春英用她们的办法苦练了一天多，在技术上就赶上她们了。
    现在，复线工程快完成了，修路大军正陆续满载着荣誉和收获而返回农村。许多农民当了劳动模范，参加了共产党或共青团，同时掌握了土方施工，桥涵建筑和铺轨钉道等技术。这一批力量，将成为河南省今后修建纵横交错的铁路网的骨干。（附图片）
