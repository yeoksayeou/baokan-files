    Wu Gang Holds Osmanthus Wine
    The bright sun is like fire, the starry flowers are brilliant, sounds of laughter never cease, red envoys cross the long sky, pointing directly at the Palace of the Moon. On the osmanthus tree, colorful flags flutter, Chang'e's heart is as sweet as honey, Wu Gang holds the osmanthus wine, wildly joyful, with ten thousand words to say. Waiting for millions of years, knowing that the east wind has spread throughout the world, looking far at Moscow, red light shines directly through the ninth heaven!

    吴刚捧着桂花酒
    沙鸥艳阳如火，星花灿灿，欢笑之声不断，红色使者过长空，直指广寒宫殿。桂花树上，彩旗飘展，嫦娥心里如蜜甜，吴刚捧着桂花酒，喜若狂，有万语千言。等待千万年，知东风把人间吹遍，遥望莫斯科，红光直射九重天！
