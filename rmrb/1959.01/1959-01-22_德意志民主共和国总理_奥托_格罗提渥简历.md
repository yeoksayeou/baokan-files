Biography of Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic

	Premier Otto Grotewohl was born in Braunschweig on March 11, 1894. He studied printing technology, and as early as his youth, he participated in the Socialist Labor Youth Movement and the German Social Democratic Party.

	Due to his active participation in political struggles, his wealth of knowledge, and his unwavering concern for the welfare of the working people, Grotewohl quickly became a respected and beloved leader within the party. At the age of twenty-seven, he served as the Minister of Education and Minister of the Interior of the State of Braunschweig, making him one of the youngest ministers in Germany at the time. Subsequently, he served as Minister of the Interior, Minister of Justice, and General Manager of the Braunschweig State Social Insurance Company. In 1925, he was elected as a member of the Reichstag and served as the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of the State of Braunschweig.

	Grotewohl persistently upheld genuine labor policies and fiercely opposed forces within the party that sought to dilute socialist goals. He devoted all his efforts to fighting against the fascism that was then arming itself and attempting to seize power domestically.

	Therefore, after the Hitler regime came to power, he was immediately subjected to persecution and intimidation by the authorities. Grotewohl was forced to leave his hometown and went to Berlin, and later to Hamburg, where he actively participated in the resistance struggle.

	Hitler's secret police arrested Grotewohl and falsely sentenced him for so-called treason. As soon as he was released from prison, he fearlessly continued his anti-fascist resistance struggle. Before he was almost arrested for the second time, he managed to escape abroad.

	Grotewohl learned a great deal during this darkest period in German history. He deeply realized that the reason fascism was able to establish its bloody reign of terror was simply because the working class had not yet united. Therefore, as soon as the war ended, Grotewohl began the important work of uniting the German workers' movement.

	Grotewohl was then the chairman of the newly established Social Democratic Party. He worked closely with Wilhelm Pieck (the current President of the Republic), who was then the chairman of the Communist Party, to merge the two parties into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. After the merger of the two parties, he remained a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Party. From 1946 to 1950, he was a member of the Saxony State Parliament.

	Grotewohl recognized that a new state could only be successfully established with the concerted efforts of all patriots. Largely due to his efforts, the fruitful work of the anti-fascist alliance of democratic parties and mass organizations began under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party.

	In the People's Congress movement, Grotewohl also tirelessly dedicated all his strength and knowledge to the unification of Germany. Currently, he is a member of the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic and a member of the People's Chamber.

	When the German Democratic Republic was founded in October 1949, all parties and factions unanimously entrusted Grotewohl with the important task of becoming the first Premier of a worker-peasant state in German history. Since then, he has repeatedly called on the West German government to work together with the German Democratic Republic to strive for the reunification of Germany. He has repeatedly demanded that West German Social Democrats stop the political struggle against their partners who are doing the same work.

	Grotewohl is a well-known and unwavering fighter against imperialism and militarism, a relentless warrior for socialism, and a friend of all peace-loving people around the world.

	Due to his significant contributions to the unity, peace, and friendship of all peoples, he has received due honor. He has been awarded the "Gold Medal for Patriotic Service," the "Karl Marx Order," and the title of "Hero of Labor." He has also received high-level medals from other countries, such as the "Order of Polonia Restituta" and the "National Flag Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." He has also been awarded the "Medal for Anti-Fascist Fighters." (Xinhua News Agency)

    德意志民主共和国总理
    奥托·格罗提渥简历
    奥托·格罗提渥总理于1894年3月11日生于不伦瑞克，他学习过印刷技术，早在青年时代，他就参加了社会主义劳动青年运动和德国社会民主党。
    由于他积极参加政治斗争，拥有丰富的知识以及始终不渝地关心劳动人民的福利，格罗提渥很快就在党内成为一个深受尊敬和爱戴的领导人。他二十七岁的时候就担任不伦瑞克州的教育部长和内政部长的职务，当时他是德国最年轻的部长之一。接着他先后担任过内政部长、司法部长以及不伦瑞克州社会保险公司总经理。1925年他当选为国会议员，并担任不伦瑞克州社会民主党的主席。
    格罗提渥坚持不懈地维护真正的劳工政策，激烈反对党内那些想冲淡社会主义目标的势力。他竭尽全力为反对当时武装起来企图在国内夺取政权的法西斯主义而斗争。
    因此，在希特勒政权执政后他立刻遭到当局的迫害和威吓。格罗提渥被迫离开家乡，他到了柏林，后来又到汉堡，在那里积极参加了抵抗斗争。
    希特勒的秘密警察逮捕了格罗提渥，并且硬以所谓叛国罪把他判刑。他刚一出狱，就毫无畏惧地继续进行反法西斯的抵抗斗争。在他几乎第二次被捕以前，他设法逃到了国外。
    格罗提渥在德国历史上的这个最黑暗的时期知道了不少东西。他深深体会到法西斯主义之所以能够建立血腥的恐怖统治，只是因为工人阶级还没有团结起来。因此，战争一结束，格罗提渥就开始进行团结德国工人运动的重大工作。
    格罗提渥当时是新建立的社会民主党的主席，他同当时担任共产党主席的威廉·皮克（现任共和国总统）紧密合作，把两个党合并成为德国统一社会党。在两党合并之后，他一直是党中央委员会政治局的委员。从1946年到1950年，他是萨克森州议会的议员。
    格罗提渥认识到只有在全体爱国者的协力下才能成功地建立新的国家。多半由于他的努力，在统一社会党的领导下，各民主党派和群众组织的反法西斯联盟的富有成果的工作开始了。
    在人民代表大会运动中，格罗提渥也孜孜不倦地为德国的统一献出了全部力量和知识。现在，他是德意志民主共和国全国阵线全国委员会的委员和人民议院的议员。
    当德意志民主共和国于1949年10月成立的时候，各党各派一致委托格罗提渥担任德国历史上第一个工农国家的总理的重任。从那时以来，他曾经无数次地呼吁西德政府同德意志民主共和国共同努力，来争取重新统一德国。他一再要求西德社会民主党人停止对同他们作同样工作的伙伴进行政治斗争。
    格罗提渥是著名的坚持不渝地反对帝国主义和军国主义的斗士，争取社会主义的不屈不挠的战士和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的朋友。
    由于他为各国人民的团结、和平和友谊作出了重大贡献，他得到了应有的荣誉。他荣获“爱国服务金质奖章”、“卡尔·马克思勋章”以及“劳动英雄”的称号。他还荣获其他国家的高级勋章，如“波兰复兴勋章”、“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗勋章”。他还荣获“反法西斯战士奖章”。　　　　　（新华社）
