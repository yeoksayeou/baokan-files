Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th: The entire Soviet people greeted the ongoing 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with tremendous political enthusiasm. The opening day of this congress, which is discussing the program for the comprehensive construction of a communist society, has become a grand day for all working people.

　　On the 27th, grand mass rallies were held in enterprises, collective farms, scientific institutions, and schools throughout the Soviet Union.

　　At the First Ball Bearing Factory in Moscow, workers immediately held a mass rally celebrating the opening of the 21st Party Congress after work. Factory Director Gromov said at the meeting that the Party Congress powerfully demonstrated the Soviet people's rock-solid political unity. The Soviet people will surely achieve new victories in communist construction. Foreman Novikov said, "Like all Soviet people, I wholeheartedly welcome the convocation of the beloved Party Congress. Although I am not a party member, the previous Party Congresses have been very significant events for me." Klimekmenova, the Communist Labor Team Leader, said, "The Party educates us young people like a loving mother and creates conditions for our growth."

　　Many factories sent letters of tribute to the Presidium of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after the mass rallies.

　　In the workshops of the Leningrad Metallurgical Plant, workers labored with particularly high enthusiasm.

　　The factory's competition plan to welcome the Party Congress has already been overfulfilled, but now, every worker is celebrating the opening of the Congress with new labor achievements. Workers in the steam turbine workshop began working on February's tasks ahead of schedule on the 27th, installing a 100,000-kilowatt steam turbine and planning to complete the installation far ahead of schedule.

　　The workers of the Minsk Automobile Factory have been working with increasing vigor these past two days. On the eve of the 21st Congress, Balachikin's team of steelworkers at this factory expressed their intention to produce sixteen tons of steel per shift during the Congress, exceeding the original target by three tons. However, on the 27th, they greatly exceeded the plan of sixteen tons, producing nineteen tons of steel per shift. On this day, the molder Zabelich said excitedly, "Today is a great day. In order to keep this day forever in our memory, we must strive to reach the goal of producing twenty tons of steel per shift."

　　In addition, the working people of Tbilisi, Almaty, Riga, Kiev, and other places are expressing their love for the Party and their determination to engage in creative labor for the comprehensive construction of a communist society through their own labor. At many mass rallies, people expressed their ambition to successfully complete the Seven-Year Plan.
