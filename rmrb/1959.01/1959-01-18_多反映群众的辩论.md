    More Reflections on Mass Debates

    The article "The Dialectical Unity of Collective Life and Individual Freedom," published on page 6 of the People's Daily on the 8th, is a very timely and worthwhile article for everyone to read. The article reflects a lively debate in the Nanwang People's Commune in Shanxi. The commune members, in their own distinct and accessible language, powerfully elucidated the dialectical relationship between collective life and individual freedom through real-life examples. In the current rectification movement, a serious and profound debate on the relationship between collective life and individual freedom will greatly help the broad masses of commune members further establish collectivist ideology and better unleash their enthusiasm for production. I hope the newspaper will coordinate with the socialist and communist education movement and publish more such reports.

    多反映群众的辩论
    8日人民日报第六版登载的“集体生活和个人自由是辩证的统一”，是一篇非常适时、值得大家阅读的好通讯。通讯反映了山西南王人民公社里的一场生动活泼的辩论，公社社员们以他们自己的鲜明通俗的语言，通过真人实例，有力地阐明了集体生活和个人自由的辩证关系。在目前的整社运动中，对集体生活和个人自由的关系认真作一次深刻的辩论，很有助于广大社员进一步树立集体主义思想，更好地发挥生产积极性。希望报上配合社会主义和共产主义教育运动，多发表这样的报道。
