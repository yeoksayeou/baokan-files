Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) convened its Fourth Enlarged Presidium Meeting of the Eighth Executive Committee in Beijing on January 28th. Based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this meeting studied and resolved issues related to trade union work under the new situation and determined the current tasks of trade unions. The meeting adopted the "Regulations on the Organizational Structure and System of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and National Committees of Industrial Trade Unions" and "Several Regulations on the System of Trade Union Grassroots Organizations."

Prior to this meeting, the ACFTU held a conference to exchange experiences on large-scale mass movements in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, as well as a trade union work conference. The meeting was attended by 76 grassroots trade union cadres from factories and mines, 47 Party secretaries and factory directors, leading officials from trade unions in provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and major provincial cities, as well as leading officials from various industries and departments of the ACFTU. The meeting extensively exchanged experiences in launching large-scale mass movements in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in 1958. Representatives from national industrial trade union committees and grassroots trade unions studied specific issues in various industries. In addition, discussions were held on propaganda and education, workers' welfare, and other issues, which provided good preparation for this Presidium meeting.

The meeting considered that in launching large-scale mass movements, it is necessary to implement the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, carry out the struggle between two lines and two ideologies, and conduct meticulous ideological and organizational work; implement the enterprise system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" (干部参加劳动，工人参加管理；改革不合理的规章制度；领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合), vigorously carry out the technical revolution, combine practical work, hard work, and skillful work, and combine breaking superstitions and respecting science; carry out socialist emulation campaigns; promote the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration; continuously improve the communist consciousness of the workers; organize workers' cultural and technical studies; conscientiously care for the workers' welfare, and closely combine grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping welfare.

The meeting focused on discussing trade union work. Under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations actively participated in the Great Leap Forward, implemented the Party's guidelines and policies, and the vast number of trade union cadres actively engaged in the magnificent mass movement on the industrial front. Significant achievements were also made in the work. The meeting unanimously agreed that the guidelines and tasks for trade union work determined by the ACFTU's rectification meeting in 1958 were correct and of great significance for improving the political and ideological level of trade union cadres and keeping up with the requirements of the development of the situation.

The meeting also discussed and arranged trade union work for 1959. 1959 is a year of decisive significance in our country's three years of arduous struggle. The 1959 national economic plan is a grand leap forward plan that is even greater than that of 1958. Faced with such a glorious and historically significant task, trade union organizations must, under the leadership of the Party, strengthen the political and ideological work of workers, further improve the communist consciousness of workers, continue to consolidate and promote the enthusiasm of workers, carry out large-scale mass production movements centered on vigorously promoting the technical revolution, launch a new upsurge in production, and complete and strive to overfulfill the 1959 national plan, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our country's socialist construction.

The meeting enthusiastically discussed the great historical significance of the great victories achieved in all aspects of our country's work in 1958. It was believed that this great victory greatly accelerated the pace of socialist construction in our country, made a good start for the three years of arduous struggle to greatly change our country's economic outlook and better complete the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The meeting expressed its respect for the great achievements made by farmers in 1958 on the agricultural front and in vigorously developing industry, and decided to further mobilize workers to better and more effectively support agricultural construction.

In 1958, a new social organization with strong vitality—the people's commune—appeared in our country's countryside. This is an event of great historical significance and a great development of Marxism-Leninism in China. The emergence of people's communes not only promoted the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, but also powerfully promoted the rapid development of industrial production in our country, and further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of workers across country. The meeting fully supported the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on certain issues concerning people's communes. The meeting also believed that trade union organizations should make it their lofty task to do a good job in the work of the people's communes.

All the comrades present at the meeting decided with full confidence that under the leadership of the Party, they would launch an even greater upsurge in production on the industrial front in 1959. The meeting called on all trade union workers to go deep into reality and into the masses with a spirit of modesty, prudence, and courage to be responsible, to display soaring enthusiasm, to do their work more practically and meticulously, and to outstandingly complete the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the working class, the Party, and the state.

    全总召开主席团扩大会议
    研究和解决了新形势下工会工作问题
    新华社30日讯　中华全国总工会于本月28日在北京召开了八届四次主席团会议（扩大）。这次会议根据中国共产党八届六中全会的精神，研究和解决了在新形势下工会工作问题，确定了当前工会工作的任务。会议通过了“关于全国总工会、各产业工会全国委员会的组织机构和组织制度的规定”、“关于工会基层组织制度的若干规定”。
    在这次会议以前，全国总工会召开了工矿交通企业大搞群众运动的经验交流和工会工作会议。参加会议的有厂矿企业基层工会工作干部七十六人、党委书记和厂长四十七人，各省、市、自治区和省属较大城市工会负责人和全总各产业、各部门的负责人。会上广泛交流了1958年工矿交通企业大搞群众运动的经验，产业工会全国委员会和基层工会代表就各产业工会的具体问题进行了研究，另外还座谈了宣传教育、职工生活等问题，为这次主席团会议作了很好的准备。
    会议认为，大搞群众运动必须贯彻党的领导，政治挂帅，开展两条路线、两种思想的斗争，进行细致的思想工作和组织工作；贯彻两参一改三结合的企业制度，大闹技术革命，实干、苦干和巧干相结合，破除迷信和尊重科学相结合；开展社会主义竞赛；发扬共产主义大协作的精神；不断地提高职工群众的共产主义觉悟，组织职工的文化、技术学习；认真关心职工生活，把抓思想、抓生产、抓生活紧密地结合起来。
    会议着重讨论了工会工作问题，工会组织在党的领导下，积极地参加了大跃进的行列，贯彻执行了党的方针路线，广大工会干部积极投入了工业战线上波澜壮阔的群众运动。工作中也作出了重大成绩。会议一致认为中华全国总工会1958年整风会议确定的工会工作的方针任务是正确的，对提高工会干部的政治思想水平，跟上形势发展的要求，有着重要的意义。
    会议还讨论和安排了1959年的工会工作。1959年是我国苦战三年中有决定意义的一年。1959年我国的国民经济计划是一个宏伟的比1958年更伟大的跃进计划。面临着这样一个具有历史意义的光荣任务，工会组织必须在党的领导下，加强职工的政治思想工作，进一步提高职工的共产主义觉悟，继续巩固和发扬职工的劳动热情，开展以大闹技术革命为中心的大规模的群众生产运动，掀起新的生产高潮，完成和争取超额完成1959年的国家计划，为我国社会主义建设事业更大、更好、更全面地跃进而奋斗。
    会议热烈讨论了我国1958年各方面工作获得伟大胜利的重大历史意义。认为这一伟大胜利大大加速了我国社会主义的建设速度，为苦战三年使我国经济面貌有一个很大改变和更好地完成发展国民经济的第二个五年计划作了良好的开端。会议对农民在1958年在农业战线上和大办工业中所获得的伟大成就，表示敬意，并决定进一步动员职工更好地、更有效地支援农业建设。
    1958年在我国农村出现了一个具有强大生命力的新的社会组织——人民公社。这是一个具有伟大历史意义的事件，是马克思列宁主义在中国的伟大发展。人民公社的出现不仅促进了农业生产大跃进，也有力地促进了我国工业生产的迅速发展，更加鼓舞了全国职工的革命干劲。会议完全拥护中国共产党八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议。会议并且认为工会组织要把作好人民公社的工作作为自己的崇高任务。
    全体到会同志，都满怀信心地决定在党的领导下，在1959年掀起一个工业战线上更大的生产高潮。会议号召全体工会工作人员以谦虚谨慎、勇于负责的精神，深入实际，深入群众，拿出冲天干劲，把工作做得更踏实、更细致，出色地完成工人阶级、党和国家交给自己的光荣任务。
