    On the Road to Abundance
    By our reporters Gong Chenghua and Li Yifang

    Facing the glow of the setting sun, after about an hour's journey, we arrived at the Xiashe work area from Baima, the location of the office of the Qunying Commune in Ningming County, where the Zhuang people live. On the streets, privately raised chickens roamed in flocks, with mother hens leading their chicks. The mountains were a deep green, and star anise bent the branches low, a fragrance of star anise hitting us. Around Xiashe, banana trees grew in forests, laden with fruit. This work area alone had more than 14,000 slopes planted with bananas, with five or six trees per slope. Longan, sand pears, Shatien pomelos, and citrus fruits were everywhere. All five work areas of this commune were rich in subtropical flowers, fruits, and specialty products. The Qunying Commune was truly a large orchard! Qian Shijin, the commune's Party Secretary, said: "The autumn harvest brought in more than 80,000 jin of star anise, and the winter harvest will bring in about one million jin. And there's even more citrus fruit, so much that we invite people to the mountains to eat it, so they can help leave seeds behind.”

    The Qunying Commune not only prominently focuses on agricultural production, but also pays attention to developing sideline production, ensuring increased income for its members. This commune had a bumper grain harvest this year, averaging 1,368 jin per mu, with the odd amount alone exceeding last year's 248 jin per mu. Now the entire commune has implemented free meals. While developing agricultural production, 1,296 people have been assigned to specialize in pig raising, fish farming, duck raising, vegetable growing, and other professions, and full use is made of the favorable subtropical conditions to grow various crops such as star anise, bananas, Shatien pomelos, citrus fruits, tung fruit, hawthorn, coffee, olives... To adapt to the new situation of the comprehensive expansion of sideline production, one of the two commune Party secretaries was extracted, and thirteen other cadres were transferred to specifically lead sideline production. They eat, sleep, work, and engage in labor production in the sideline production workshops. The Party branch secretaries of each production team lead agriculture, and the deputy secretaries or team leaders are in charge of sideline production. The commune has recently concentrated another 2,446 laborers to form sideline production teams to focus on sideline production. Due to the strengthened leadership of the commune's various levels of organizations, and the adoption of a combination of regular operations and short-term campaigns, sideline production has seen vigorous development. All 3,500 mu of ponds in the commune are used for fish farming, and this year, more than 100,000 jin of fish can be produced; there are 17,675 pigs, averaging more than three per household. Vegetables and fruits are all abundant. The Xiashe production area, due to the assignment of dedicated personnel to manage banana production and strengthen care, has seen bananas growing abundantly, large, and plump, with some bunches bearing over 200. This production area's income from bananas alone has increased two-fold compared to last year. Responsible cadres of the commune told reporters: "This year the commune's sideline income can reach 380,000 yuan, and more than 230,000 yuan has already been received. This income alone is enough to pay four months' wages with some left over." All 12,612 laborers in the commune received wages for the four months from September to December. Among them, 90% of the laborers received an average of 3 to 5.4 yuan per month; 217 strong commune members received an average of 6.5 yuan per month; and even the weaker laborers received an average of 1.5 to 2.2 yuan per month.

    In the Qunying People's Commune, a scene of abundance in food and clothing and a comfortable life is everywhere. The public canteens serve two dishes and a soup for each meal, all hot food. Under the eaves, old women sit in the sunlight sewing new clothes of blue and cyan cloth. On the cutting boards of the commune's clothing factory, stacks of new fabrics of various colors are piled up, and more than forty sewing machines are working day and night to make various styles of clothing for the commune members. In the supply and marketing cooperative distribution departments located in each production team, or in the Xiashe state-run central store, commune members buying daily necessities come and go in an endless stream. Everywhere, one can see farmers wearing "Warrior" brand rubber shoes and new sanitary clothing. The person in charge of the Xiashe central store told us: "From December 6th, the day the commune members received their wages, to the 24th, the daily sales of fabrics, rubber shoes, cloth shoes, sanitary clothing, vests, towels, etc., reached more than 1,200 yuan, and the sales volume of cotton cloth alone increased four-fold compared to November."

    The Qunying People's Commune has achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture and sideline production this year, and the lives of the commune members are getting better and better. The agricultural loans borrowed from the state in the past have now been basically repaid. Huang Yaofeng, a commune member who was deep plowing and turning the soil, told reporters on the ridge with a smile that after the establishment of the commune, the heavy burden of eating that had weighed on our shoulders for generations has been lifted. My two laborers also received four months' wages of 37 yuan, and after repaying the loans, everyone sewed a new set of clothes.

    But this is just the beginning. Next year, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery industries of the Qunying Commune will experience an even greater and more comprehensive development, making the lives of the commune members even more rich and colorful.

    在丰衣足食的道路上
    本报记者　龚成华　李益芳
    迎着夕阳的余晖，经过大约一小时的路程，我们就从僮族住居的宁明县群英公社办公的地方——白马走进夏石工区了。街上，社员私人养的鸡子成群，母鸡带着成群的小鸡跑来跑去。满山一片深绿，八角压得枝头伸不直腰，一股八角香气迎面扑来。夏石周围，香蕉成林，果实累累。单是这个工区种的香蕉就有一万四千多坡，每坡五、六棵不等。龙眼、沙梨、沙田柚、柑果，比比皆是。这个公社的五个工区，都盛产亚热带的花果和特产。群英公社真是一个大果园！公社党委书记钱世金说：秋收八角八万多斤，冬季八角要收一百万斤左右。柑果那就更多啦，多到请人上山去吃，以便帮忙留出种子来。
    群英公社不仅突出地抓农业生产，而且注意发展副业生产，保证社员增加收入。这个公社今年的粮食大丰收，平均每亩产粮一千三百六十八斤，光是零头就比去年亩产二百四十八斤还多。现在全公社已经实行了吃饭不要钱。在发展农业生产的同时，抽调出一千二百九十六人分工专搞养猪、养鱼、养鸭、种菜等专业，并充分利用地处亚热带的有利条件，多种八角、香蕉、沙田柚、柑果、桐果、山楂、咖啡、橄榄……。为适应副业生产全面展开的新形势，公社党委两个书记抽出一人，另外调集十三名干部专门领导副业生产，他们吃饭、睡觉、办公和劳动生产都在副业工场中。各生产队的支部书记领导农业，副书记或队长专管副业。公社在最近又集中二千四百四十六个劳动力组成副业生产队，突击副业生产。由于公社各级组织加强领导，采取经常经营和短期突击相结合的办法，副业生产得到蓬勃发展。全公社三千五百亩水塘都养了鱼，今年可产鱼十万多斤；生猪一万七千六百七十五头，平均每户三头以上。蔬菜、水果样样丰收。夏石生产区由于固定专人管理香蕉生产，加强护理，香蕉长得又多、又肥、又大，多的一串结到二百多个。这个生产区光是香蕉收入就比去年增加两倍。公社的负责干部告诉记者：今年公社副业收入可以达到三十八万元，现在已经收入二十三万多元，单是这项收入就够发四个月的工资还有剩余。全社一万二千六百一十二个劳动力都领到从9月到12月四个月的工资。其中有90％的劳动力，平均每个月领到工资三元至五元四角；二百一十七个劳动力强的社员，平均每月领到六元五角工资；劳动力弱的，平均每个月也领到一元五角到二元二角。
    在群英人民公社里，处处呈现一片衣食丰足、生活康乐的景象。公共食堂里每餐两菜一汤，都是热饭热菜。在屋角下，老太太们坐在阳光底下缝制蓝布、青布新衣。公社被服厂的案板上，堆着各色各样的新布，四十多架缝纫机日夜不停地在给社员赶制各式各样的服装。设在各个生产队的供销社分销部里，或是在夏石国营中心商店里，购买日用品的社员来往不绝。到处都可以看见穿“回力牌”胶鞋和新卫生衣的农民。夏石中心商店的负责人告诉我们：从12月6日社员领工资的那一天起到24日止，每天销售的布匹、胶鞋、布鞋、卫生衣、背心、毛巾等的营业额达到一千二百多元，光是棉布的销售量就比11月份增加四倍。
    群英人民公社今年的农业、副业获得全面丰收，社员们的生活越过越好，过去向国家借贷的农业贷款，现在已经基本还清。正在深耕翻土的社员黄耀风在田坎上满脸笑容地告诉记者说，建立公社以后，吃饭这个世世代代压在肩上的重担放下了，我两个劳动力还领得四个月的工资三十七元，还清贷款以后，每个人都缝了一套新衣服。
    但，这只是个开始，明年群英公社的农林牧副渔五业将来一个更大的全面的大发展，使社员的生活越过越丰富多彩。
