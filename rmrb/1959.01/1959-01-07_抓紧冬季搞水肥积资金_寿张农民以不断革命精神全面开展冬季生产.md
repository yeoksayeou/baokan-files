Seize the Winter to Develop Water, Fertilizer, and Accumulate Funds
Shou Zhang Peasants Launch a Comprehensive Winter Production Campaign with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution

    (Our report) Jinan — Taking ideology, production, and livelihood together, Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, is carrying out a heated winter production campaign. Since the beginning of winter, the county's 18 township communes, with a workforce of 460,000 people, have achieved initial success in the winter production upsurge centered on wheat field management, deep plowing, and pig raising for manure accumulation. By December 1958, over one million mu of wheat fields across the county had generally completed one round of topdressing fertilizer, irrigation of 460,000 mu, and rolling/hoeing of 1,020,000 mu, basically ensuring that the wheat seedlings were well-fed and watered, guaranteeing their rapid growth. The area of first-class seedlings increased from the original 450,000+ mu to 750,000+ mu. In terms of winter land preparation, of the 440,000 mu task, 366,000 mu has been completed, with 210,000 mu combining winter plowing with layered fertilization. Pig raising has also seen significant development, with the number of live pigs more than doubling since August. In sideline production, a large number of starch factories and distilleries have been established throughout the county. The variety of sideline production has expanded from weaving, transportation, saltpeter production, and brick kilns to as many as 28 types, generating an income of over 3 million yuan in the past four months.

    The reason why the winter production campaign in this county has developed so rapidly is mainly due to the fact that the leadership departments of this county have firmly grasped three key aspects in their work – grasping political ideology, grasping production management, and grasping livelihood arrangements.

    Grasping political and ideological work is one of the experiences of the Shou Zhang County Party Committee in organizing the upsurge of winter production. Because Shou Zhang County achieved a comprehensive agricultural harvest in 1958, some cadres and masses have developed such ideas since the beginning of winter: "We've worked for a year, the grain problem is solved, it's time to rest," "The wheat is well-planted, with plenty of fertilizer, close planting, and vigorous growth, so it can yield a bumper harvest even without management," and so on. After analyzing the harm of these complacent and "good enough" ideas to winter production, the Shou Zhang County Party Committee prominently grasped the working method of "speaking, checking, viewing, calculating, evaluating, and debating" to thoroughly break various erroneous thoughts. The so-called "speaking" is to speak extensively about socialism and communism, and about the construction plans of the county and township communes, so as to enable cadres and the masses to recognize the situation, clarify the direction, and make them understand that this year is a decisive year, and that doing a good job in winter production, especially managing wheat well, is significant for achieving victory in this year's decisive battle; the so-called "checking" is to organize cadres at all levels of the county, township commune, battalion, and company from top to bottom in a timely manner to conduct a comprehensive inspection, so that cadres and the masses can correctly recognize the achievements of their work and the current problems; at the same time, ideological understanding was unified through on-site visits, accounting comparisons, and large-scale debates.

    Comprehensively arranging winter production and organizing professional armies is the second experience of the Shou Zhang County Party Committee in organizing the all-round leap forward in the winter production movement. Since the beginning of winter, the Shou Zhang County Party Committee has summarized the experience of the bumper harvest and raised questions such as: "What should we rely on to achieve the 1959 plan?" "What should we do now?" "Should winter production be done on a large scale or a small scale?" "What should we do?" allowing commune members to engage in airing views, debate, and arrange winter production work in the production process. According to the opinions of the commune members, the County Party Committee organized various professional armies. One army is the wheat field management army, which is specifically responsible for topdressing, irrigating, and loosening the soil for wheat. Another army is the plowing army, which is responsible for winter plowing, requiring deep plowing of more than three feet, combined with layered fertilization during plowing. Another is the water conservancy army, and another is the feeding and manure accumulation army. There is also a sideline production army. After the formation of various professional armies, the County Party Committee also paid attention to equipping them with key personnel, strengthening leading cadres, and universally promoting the "four guarantees" (township commune guarantees battle zone, battalion guarantees company, company guarantees platoon, commune members guarantee their own share) and "eight determinations" (determine personnel, determine tasks, determine time, determine specifications, determine quality, determine rewards and punishments, timed inspection and acceptance, regular summary and evaluation) production responsibility system. In this way, the sense of production responsibility of cadres and commune members has been greatly strengthened, efficiency has been improved, and quality has been guaranteed.

    While grasping political ideology and grasping production management, the Shou Zhang County Party Committee paid great attention to the livelihood of the commune members. Since the beginning of winter, in view of the high enthusiasm of the commune members, the Shou Zhang County Party Committee has made the following regulations to ensure that the commune members have sufficient rest time: The labor of commune members generally should not exceed eight hours per day, and should not exceed ten hours at most. On the first and fifteenth day of each month, there will be two days off to handle personal matters, and special care should be given to women participating in production. Since the beginning of winter, the County Party Committee has proposed that party organizations at all levels should ensure that commune members achieve "four warms" and "five goods." The "four warms" are that commune members eat warm, live warm, wear warm, and feel warm in their hearts. The "five goods" are good rest, good entertainment, good cadre-mass relations, good labor production, and good commune member life. In order to achieve this requirement, the County Party Committee took three measures: First, it abolished the canteens of the township commune organs, and cadres ate with the commune members so that it would be easier to discover and solve problems. Second, in view of the fact that the original canteens were too large and inconvenient for commune members to eat, the scale of the canteens was adjusted, generally from 500 or 600 people to about 100 people, and the ranks of catering staff were purified. Third, a general inspection was carried out on homes for the elderly, maternity hospitals, and nurseries, all of which had specially established kitchens and heated kang beds. At present, life management committees have been generally established in the canteens throughout the county. Most of the canteens have menus and recipes, and coarse grains are made into fine food. The Satellite Battalion Party Branch of the Litai Township People's Commune studies the work of the canteen every seven days, and decided that the secretary Guan Dengqian and the female battalion commander Zhang Changjie would be specifically responsible. In addition to the democratic establishment of a life management committee, each production team also elected a representative to form a commune member life representative meeting, which holds a meeting every half month to study the life problems of the commune members while studying production.

    The result of the Shou Zhang County Party Committee's firm grasp of livelihood in winter production has proved that it not only did not hinder production, but on the contrary, greatly promoted production. The fact that the winter land preparation of the Taiqian Brigade of the Taiqian People's Commune powerfully illustrates this point. According to the statistics of this brigade, thanks to paying attention to the full rest and livelihood of the commune members, the quality of winter plowing was the same as that of autumn plowing, and the efficiency was increased by one-third.

    抓紧冬季搞水肥积资金
    寿张农民以不断革命精神全面开展冬季生产
    本报讯　思想、生产、生活一齐抓，山东省寿张县冬季生产运动搞得热火朝天。入冬以来，这个县十八个乡公社四十六万劳动大军在以麦田管理、深翻和养猪积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮中首战告捷。到1958年12月，全县一百万多亩麦田，普遍完成追肥一遍，浇麦四十六万亩，压麦、锄麦一百零二万亩，基本上达到了使小麦吃饱喝足，保证了麦苗的迅速升级。全县一类苗由原来的四十五万多亩，增加到七十五万多亩。在冬翻土地方面，四十四万亩的冬翻任务，已完成三十六万六千多亩，其中有二十一万亩结合冬翻分层施肥。养猪事业也有很大发展，毛猪比8月份前增加了一倍多。在副业生产上，全县建立了大批淀粉厂和酒厂。副业生产的品种，从编织、运输、制硝、砖瓦窑等发展到二十八种之多，四个月来收入达三百万多元。
    这个县的冬季生产运动所以这样迅速开展，主要经验是这个县的领导部门在工作中紧紧地抓住了三个环节——抓政治思想，抓生产管理，抓生活安排。
    抓政治思想工作，是寿张县委组织冬季生产高潮的经验之一。寿张县由于1958年获得了农业上的全面丰收，所以入冬以来，在部分干部和群众中产生了这样一些思想：“干了一年了，粮食问题解决了，该歇歇啦”、“小麦种的好，肥多、密植、生长旺盛，不用管也能丰收”等等。中共寿张县委分析了这些麻痹自满和“差不多”的思想对冬季生产的危害以后，突出的抓住了“讲、查、看、算、评、辩”六个字的工作方法，大破各种错误思想。所谓“讲”，就是大讲社会主义和共产主义，大讲县、乡公社建设规划，从而使干部群众认清形势，明确方向，使他们知道今年是决战年，搞好冬季生产特别是管好小麦，对取得今年决战胜利的意义；所谓“查”，就是从上而下及时组织县、乡公社、营、连各级干部，进行全面检查，使干部和群众正确认识工作成绩和当前存在的问题；同时通过实地参观、算账对比和大辩论，统一了思想认识。
    全面安排冬季生产，组织专业大军，这是寿张县委组织冬季生产运动全面跃进的第二条经验。入冬以来，寿张县委通过总结丰收经验，提出了：“实现1959年规划靠什么？”“当前搞什么？”“冬季生产是大搞还是小搞？”“搞哪些？”等问题，让社员在生产过程中，进行鸣放辩论，安排冬季生产工作。县委根据社员的意见，组织了各种专业大军。一支是麦田管理大军，专门负责给小麦追肥、浇水、松土。一支是翻地大军，负责冬耕翻地，要求深翻三尺以上，结合翻地分层施肥。一支是水利大军，另一支是饲养积肥大军。还有副业大军。各专业大军组成以后，县委并注意配备了骨干，加强了领导干部，普遍推行了“四包”（乡公社包战区，营包连、连包排、社员包了）、“八定”（定人员、定活落、定时间、定规格、定质量、定奖惩、定时检查验收、定期总结评比）的生产责任制。这样一来，大大的加强了干部、社员的生产责任心，提高了效率，保证了质量。
    在抓政治思想、抓生产管理的同时，寿张县委以极大的注意力关怀着社员的生活。入冬以来，寿张县委鉴于社员劳动情绪的高涨，为保证社员有充分休息的时间，曾作了这样的规定：社员们的劳动一般每天不得超过八小时，最多不得超过十小时，每月初一、十五放假两天处理个人事情，对妇女参加生产也作到特殊照顾。入冬以来，县委提出要各级党组织保证使社员作到“四暖”、“五好”。“四暖”是社员吃暖、住暖、穿暖、心意暖。“五好”是休息好、娱乐好、干群关系好、劳动生产好、社员生活好。为了达到这一要求，县委采取了三方面的措施：首先取消了各乡公社机关伙房，干部一律和社员一块吃，便于发现问题，解决问题。第二，鉴于原来食堂偏大，社员吃饭不方便，调整了食堂规模，一般由五、六百人一处调整到百人左右一处，纯洁了炊事人员队伍。第三，对敬老院、妇产院、托儿所普遍进行了一次检查，都专门建立了伙房，支上了热炕。目前全县的食堂普遍地建立了生活管理委员会，绝大多数食堂都有饭谱和菜谱，作到了粗粮细作。李台乡人民公社卫星营党支部，每七天研究一次食堂工作，并决定由书记关登乾和女营长张长杰具体负责。他们除民主建立了生活管理委员会，每个生产小组还推选一个代表，组成社员生活代表会，每半月开一次会议，在研究生产的同时，研究社员的生活问题。
    寿张县委在冬季生产中，狠抓生活的结果证明，不仅没有妨碍生产，相反，大大促进了生产。台前人民公社台前大队，冬翻地的事实有力地说明了这一点。据这个大队的统计，由于注意了社员的充分休息和生活，冬翻和秋翻相比，质量相同，效率提高三分之一。
