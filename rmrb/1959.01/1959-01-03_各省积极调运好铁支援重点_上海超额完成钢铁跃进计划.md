Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai has already surpassed its 1958 steel production target of 1.2 million tons. As of January 30th, the city's steel output has reached 1,219,137 tons. This is a continued effort by the city's people to present a gift to the 1959 New Year after recently completing the state plan of 1.11 million tons of steel. As a result, Shanghai's steel output in 1958 has increased by nearly 1.4 times compared to 1957, and more than 230 times that of 1949.

In Shanghai's 1958 struggle to produce 1.2 million tons of steel, the mass movement in "large" and "foreign" steel enterprises played a significant role. Since the second half of the year, all fronts of the city, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, have worked together to rapidly build 52 large-scale steel furnaces through mass movements, greatly increasing steelmaking capacity. Steelworkers launched a vigorous technical revolution, tapped the equipment potential of old steel furnaces, rapidly brought new steel furnaces to normal production, and devised various methods to solve many complex technical problems in indigenous iron smelting, resulting in a sharp increase in steel production.

The nationwide "small indigenous groups" movement for mining, coal mining, and iron smelting has greatly promoted the increase in steel production in Shanghai's "large" and "foreign" steel enterprises. Without the development of the nationwide "small indigenous groups," it would have been impossible for Shanghai to achieve such a high rate of steel production growth. Especially since the fourth quarter, under the instruction of the Party Central Committee, the provincial Party committees of various regions have vigorously transferred pig iron to support Shanghai. Provinces and autonomous regions such as Guangxi, Fujian, Shandong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hunan have organized tens of thousands of people to transfer the best indigenous iron to support Shanghai's steelmaking efforts.

The struggle surrounding the task of 1.2 million tons of steel has significantly changed the face of Shanghai's steel industry. In 1958, in addition to the large-scale expansion of old factories such as Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 6, a brand-new large steel plant with converter workshops and electric furnace workshops, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, emerged. In addition to the construction of a large number of steelmaking workshops, silicon steel sheet plants, steel pipe plants, medium plate workshops, thin plate workshops, seamless steel pipe workshops, and billet workshops have also been built or are under construction. These major construction projects enable Shanghai, which has always produced small-sized steel, to smelt more high-quality steel and alloy steel, and roll and cast large and medium-sized steel and steel castings in the future, creating favorable conditions for the development of the electromechanical industry towards heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge products, thereby better supporting all parts of the country.

### 各省积极调运好铁支援重点  上海超额完成钢铁跃进计划

    各省积极调运好铁支援重点
    上海超额完成钢铁跃进计划
    据新华社讯　上海市1958年炼钢一百二十万吨的跃进指标已经提前超额完成。到30日为止，全市钢产量已达到一百二十一万九千一百三十七吨。这是全市人民不久前完成一百一十一万吨钢的国家计划之后，继续努力向1959年元旦的献礼。至此，上海1958年的钢产量已经比1957年增长了近一点四倍，为1949年的两百三十多倍。
    1958年上海在为年产一百二十万吨钢的斗争中，“大”“洋”炼钢企业大搞群众运动发挥了巨大的威力。下半年以来，全市工农兵学商各条战线通力协作，用大搞群众运动的方式，快速建成了五十二座大型炼钢炉，大大增加了炼钢能力。炼钢工人们大闹技术革命，挖掘老炼钢炉的设备潜力，使新的炼钢炉迅速趋向正常生产，并且想出各种办法来解决土铁炼钢的许多复杂的技术问题，使钢的产量急剧增长。
    全国采矿、采煤、炼铁的“小土群”运动，对上海“大”“洋”炼钢企业增产钢起了巨大的促进作用。没有全国“小土群”的发展，上海要取得钢产量如此高速度的增长是不可能的。特别是第四季度以来，党中央指示各地省委大力调运生铁支援上海，广西、福建、山东、江西、浙江、安徽、江苏、河南、湖南等省和自治区，便组织了成千成万的群众，调运最好的土铁，支援上海炼钢。
    围绕着一百二十万吨钢任务所进行的斗争，显著地改变了上海钢铁工业的面貌。1958年，上海除了上钢一厂、二厂、三厂、六厂等老厂作了较大规模的扩建，还出现了有转炉车间和电炉车间的全新的大钢铁厂——上钢五厂；除了建设大批炼钢车间，还已经建成和正在建设矽钢片厂、钢管厂、中板车间、薄板车间、无缝钢管车间和开坯车间等。这些重大的建设工程使一向生产小型钢材的上海，今后将能冶炼更多的优质钢、合金钢，轧制和浇制大中型的钢材和铸钢件，为机电工业向重型、大型、精密、尖端产品方向发展创造了有利条件，从而更好地支援全国各地。
