Yongfeng People's Commune Members Remotely Send Greetings to Dulles
Editor's Note: Before the New Year, we received a letter from the Northeast Wang Station Party General Branch of the Yongfeng People's Commune in Beijing. The letter stated: "After the 'Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes' was published, the commune members were all delighted and enthusiastically engaged in studying it. When everyone learned that Dulles and his ilk were spreading rumors and slandering our people's communes, they were very angry. They used their own experiences and insights to refute the ignorant Dulles." The letter included three articles, many of which contained discussions by the commune members. We are now publishing some excerpts as a New Year's gift from the Yongfeng People's Commune members to Dulles, even though it is a little late.
  Wang Yuling: I am twenty-two years old this year and have four children. Before, I couldn't go out to work, and the family's economy depended entirely on my husband. I worried about food and fuel every month. Since the establishment of the people's commune, my eldest child has gone to primary school, and the other three children have entered the nursery. They are very well cared for there, and any illnesses are treated. They eat very well. My children have all gained weight after only three months in the nursery.
    I joined the production team and work in the fields every day, and I'm very happy. After work, I go to the canteen for a hot meal, and I don't have to fuss around the stove anymore! In the evening, my husband and I pick up the children from the nursery. They open their little mouths to sing newly learned songs and say polite things to me. The whole family listens happily.
    Since the establishment of the Red and Expert University, both my husband and I have been studying in the horticulture department. When we get home at night, he helps me review my lessons.
    It's getting cold, and coal has been distributed to us. The higher authorities are taking really good care of us. We women even get four days off a month! Since the establishment of the commune, these good days have been getting better and better!
    Huang Yuying: After the establishment of the people's commune, adults and children are all at ease!
    Before, the whole family depended on my husband alone, and we worried about food every month. Whenever I asked him for money to buy food and oil, we would quarrel because he was afraid I would spend the money recklessly.
    Now the children are in the nursery, and they've gained a lot of weight! I'm working in the fields now. Before, I often only ate pickles at home. Now, after work, I eat hot meals and cooked vegetables in the canteen, which is so convenient!
    After the commune educated my husband, he's much better! We don't quarrel anymore. Since the establishment of the commune, I have truly been liberated. I am very willing to work and learn culture! These days are much better than before!
    Hu Yurong: In the old society, the poor suffered. My children's father was disabled and unable to work. My nine-year-old child and I had to prepare the land, sow seeds, and plant crops. The grain we harvested was not enough to eat, and we still had to pay exorbitant taxes. We really couldn't survive. Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao for leading us to turn ourselves around and establish mutual aid teams and cooperatives, our lives have been getting better day by day. But because my family was small, when I participated in labor, no one at home could cook. So, I had to cook all the day's meals in the morning and eat cold dishes and cold meals. Over time, I often got sick. After communization, public canteens were established. Meals were free, and I could eat hot dishes and hot meals after work. My two children went to school, and I also got rid of my illiteracy. Now I am focused on production. If production is done well, life will be even happier. The benefits of the commune are endless. Dulles, you are really telling lies with your eyes open.
    Sun Guifen: There are nine people in my family. In the past, housework overwhelmed me. Every day, besides cooking, I had to carry water, take care of the children, push the millstone, fuss around the stove, and worry about food and clothing. After the establishment of the commune, we women were completely liberated and no longer had to fuss around the stove. I deeply appreciate the benefits of communization and am determined to work hard to improve production in order to thank the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Wang Rongzhen: I have five children, ranging in age from two to ten. My eldest child and second daughter have gone to primary school, my third and fourth daughters have gone to kindergarten, and my youngest daughter has been sent to the nursery.
    The children eat well, play well, and sing and dance in the kindergarten and nursery. Every morning, after washing up, the children happily leave. They even say, "Goodbye, Mom." They also come back on their own in the evening, only the youngest daughter needs to be picked up. We eat all three meals in the canteen. The food is hot and we are relaxed. We work with peace of mind. Before, it was troublesome. The children were coaxed by the older children or their grandmother. Every day, after returning from work, we had to cook. In the summer, the stove made the house smoky and hot. When eating, the children cried and vomited, making a lot of noise. The adults in the fields were also worried, always thinking about whether they would fall into the water. My second daughter once fell into the reed pond. Fortunately, I was there at the time and grabbed her quickly, so she was okay. Before, I was tired and worried, and often sick. Now I don't have to worry about that and can work with peace of mind. I am no longer sick.
    Grandma Wang: Dulles is a high-ranking American official. He seems to know everything and even wants to talk about our Chinese families. When it comes to family, I know more than he does. I married into this family when I was seventeen, and I am seventy-one years old this year. I have never enjoyed such happiness as I do now. Before, the whole family of more than ten people only farmed eleven mu of land, so they had to take their sons to work as hired laborers. At that time, they were only a little over ten years old. Every day after returning home, they also had to go to the Shahe River to buy rice and broad beans. That's how we lived. They never had a good life, unlike the children today who are so happy. In the past, we ate old corn, and we even had to mix the husks in. Today's corn bread is sweet and hot, and we don't even have to bother ourselves.

### 永丰人民公社社员们遥寄杜勒斯

    永丰人民公社社员们遥寄杜勒斯
    编者按：过年以前，我们接到北京永丰人民公社东北旺站党总支的一封来信，信上说：“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”公布以后，社员们都欢欣鼓舞地进行学习，当大家知道杜勒斯之流造谣生事污蔑我人民公社时，都非常气愤，他们用自己切身的经历和体会来驳斥不懂装懂的杜勒斯。信里附来三篇文稿，其中有很多是社员群众的谈论。我们现在摘录一点发表，算作为永丰人民公社社员们送给杜勒斯的一份新年礼物吧；虽然寄赠得稍迟了一些。
  王玉玲：我今年二十二岁了，有四个孩子。以前我不能出工干活，家庭经济全靠我丈夫一人维持。一到月头就愁粮愁柴的。自从人民公社成立后，我的大孩子上小学，另三个孩子入了托儿所。那里教养得很周到，有点什么病也都给医治。吃得也很好，才入托三个月，我的孩子都胖啦。
    我加入了生产队下地干活，天天高高兴兴的，下了工就到食堂吃热呼饭，再也甭围着锅台转啦！晚上，我和我丈夫把孩子从托儿所接回家。她们张着小嘴儿唱新学会的歌，对着我学说礼貌的话，全家人乐呵呵地听着很高兴。
    自从红专大学成立后，我和我丈夫都在园林系学习。晚上回家后，他帮助我复习功课。
    天冷了，煤也发给我们了。上级照顾得真周到，我们妇女一个月还有四天假呢！自从公社成立后，这好日子真是越过越带劲哪！
    黄玉英：人民公社成立后，大人孩子全都松心啦！
    从前，全家就靠我丈夫一人，月月愁粮食。一问他要钱买粮食买油等就要争吵起来，他怕我把钱乱花了。
    现在孩子放在托儿所，胖多啦！我下地生产了。从前在家时常常光吃咸菜，现在下了工就在食堂吃热饭熟菜，可省心哪！
    公社教育我丈夫后，他好多啦！我们现在已不再吵架。公社成立后，我可真是解放了。干活啦，学文化啦，我可愿意去呢！这日子过得比从前强多啦！
    胡玉荣：在旧社会，穷人就是受苦受气。孩子他爹残废了不能劳动，我和九岁的孩子耠地、撒种、种庄稼，打的粮食不够吃还要交苛捐杂税，我们实在没法活下去。多亏党和毛主席领导我们把身翻，成立了互助组，合作社，生活一天比一天好起来。但因我家人口单，参加劳动，家里没人做饭，只好早上把一天的饭做好，吃凉菜凉饭，时间长了就经常生病。公社化后建立了公共食堂，吃饭不要钱，下班后能吃热菜热饭，两个孩子到学校上学，我也摘掉了文盲帽子。现在我就一心搞生产，生产搞好了，生活就更幸福了。公社的好处真说不完。杜勒斯你真是睁眼说瞎话。
    孙桂芬：我家九口人，过去家务劳动压得我喘不过气来，每天除做饭外，还要挑水看孩子，推碾子，围着锅台转，愁吃愁穿一心挂几头。公社成立后，我们妇女彻底解放了，再甭围着锅台转了。我深深体会到公社化的好处，决心拿出十足干劲搞好生产，来感谢党和毛主席。
    王荣珍：我共有从二岁到十岁的五个孩子。大孩子和二女儿上小学念书去了，三、四女儿上幼儿园了，小女儿送托儿所了。
    孩子们在幼儿园和托儿所，吃得好，玩得好，还唱歌跳舞。每天清早梳洗完，孩子便高高兴兴地走了。走时还说：“妈妈再见。”傍晚也是她们自己回来，只有小女儿才要接送。我们三顿都到食堂里去吃饭，饭菜热，又清闲，我们干起活来十分安心。提起以前，那可麻烦啦，孩子们由大孩子或者奶奶哄着，每天干活回来，还得烧饭，暑天把房子烧得又烟又热，吃饭时孩子又哭又吐，吵吵闹闹。大人在地里还得担心，塘满井满的，总记挂着他们会不会掉到水里去，二姑娘有一回便掉到苇塘里去了，幸好当时在，抓得快，才没事。以前又累又虑，常病的；现在不再操这份心思，安心干活了，病也没有了。
    王家老奶奶：杜勒斯是美国的大官，他好像什么都懂，还要谈论我们中国人的家庭。要说家庭我比他懂得多，我十七岁便嫁来这家，今年我已经七十一岁了，从没有过像如今享福。从前，全家十多口人，才种了十一亩地，只好带着儿子替人做短工，那时他们还只有十岁多一点呢。每天回家后，还得到沙河去买米和蚕豆。就这样过日子。他们从未过过好日子，那像现在的小孩幸福。以前我们吃老玉米，还须把皮掺上，那像今天的窝头又甜又热，还用不着自己麻烦。
