　　Produce More Fat Ducks
　　The Linji People's Commune in Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, has vigorously developed duck farming by utilizing the favorable conditions of the water network area. By the end of last year, the number of ducks had increased from more than 3,000 in 1957 to more than 60,000.
　　In the past, this commune had a poor foundation for raising group ducks. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the duck farming industry has developed greatly. The commune established a sideline production committee headed by the deputy director of the commune, and appointed a committee member to specifically lead the duck farming work. The commune established a central breeding farm, and established 45 breeding farms with the production team as the unit. It also transferred more than 420 commune members with duck raising experience to serve as breeding management. In addition, a system of "three fixings, three guarantees, and one reward" was implemented, which fixed people, fatness, and eggs, and guaranteed grazing, feed, no disease or injury, and rewarded those who exceeded the quota. After the Limin Brigade implemented this system, the fatness of the ducks increased significantly. For example, the original requirement for first-class ducks was to guarantee three catties of fat, but after careful breeding by the breeders, the fat of first-class ducks reached five catties. The Lianmeng Brigade increased egg production by 40% compared to the past.
　　In order to support the needs of cities and the country, the commune sold more than 40,000 ducks and 56,000 catties of eggs in November last year alone. At present, the Linji Commune is actively preparing everything to make the duck farming industry take another bigger leap forward.

    生产更多的肥鸭
    江苏淮安县林集人民公社，利用水网地区的有利条件，大力发展了养鸭事业。到去年年底，已由1957年的三千多只，发展到六万多只。
    这个社过去饲养群鸭基础较差。建立人民公社后，养鸭事业获得了很大发展。公社成立了以副社长为首的副业生产委员会，并确定一个委员专门领导养鸭工作。公社建立了一个中心饲养场，又以生产小队为单位，建立了四十五个饲养场，并抽调四百二十多个有养鸭经验的社员，担任饲养管理工作。另外又实行定人、定膘、定蛋和保放养、保饲料、保无病无伤，超额进行奖励的“三定、三保、一奖制”。利民大队实行这一制度后，鸭子肥膘显著增长。如原订一等鸭保膘三斤，经饲养员的精心饲养，一等鸭的肥膘达到五斤。联盟大队比过去增产蛋品40％。
    公社为了支援城市和国家的需要，在去年11月一次就出售鸭子四万余只，蛋品五万六千斤。目前林集公社正在积极做好一切准备工作，使养鸭事业再来一个更大的跃进。
