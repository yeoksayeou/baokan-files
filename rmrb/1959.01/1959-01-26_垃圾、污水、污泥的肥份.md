　　Fertilizer Content of Garbage, Sewage, and Sludge

　　Garbage: Garbage can be broadly divided into two types: one is the residual matter accumulated from our daily life; the other is the furnace ash and other waste materials left over from industrial production. The composition of garbage is very complex. Generally, garbage contains 0.52% nitrogen, 0.62% phosphorus, and 0.4% to 0.6% potassium. These are excellent fertilizers for agricultural production.

　　Sewage:

　　Sewage can be roughly categorized into two types: one is domestic sewage, and the other is industrial wastewater. Domestic sewage refers to wastewater discharged from toilets, kitchens, bathhouses, laundry rooms, and cleaning activities; industrial wastewater refers to water used by factories in the production process. In sewage, water is the main component, with solids accounting for only about 0.1%. Fresh sewage has a slight odor and a grayish-yellow color. After rotting, it has the distinctive odor of hydrogen sulfide, and the color also turns dark gray. Sewage contains a lot of bacteria and organic matter. According to general sewage testing results, each kilogram of sewage contains 50 milligrams of nitrogen, 14 milligrams of phosphorus, and 29 milligrams of potassium. Using it to irrigate farmland serves both as water and as manure.

　　Sludge:

　　Sludge is the dirty matter that settles out of sewage, containing 0.24% nitrogen, 0.46% phosphorus, and 1.22% potassium. It is not only a good fertilizer but also can produce biogas.

    垃圾、污水、污泥的肥份
    垃圾　垃圾大体上可分为两种，一种是我们日常生活上积存下来的残余物质；另一种是工业生产上用余的炉灰渣以及其他废弃物。垃圾所含的成份很复杂。一般垃圾中含有0.52％的氮，0.62％的磷和0.4％到0.6％的钾。这些东西是农业生产上的很好肥料。
    污水
  　污水归纳起来大体有两种：一种是生活污水，一种是工业废水。生活污水就是洗厕所、厨房、澡堂、洗衣房和打扫清洁卫生等等排出的污水；工业废水是指工厂在生产过程中用过的水。在污水中，水份占主要成份，大致说来，固体仅有0.1％。新鲜的污水稍有臭味，颜色灰黄，经过腐化才有硫化氢的特臭，颜色也同时变为深灰。污水里所含有的细菌和有机物质很多。据一般污水化验的结果，每公斤污水含氮五十毫克，磷十四毫克，钾二十九毫克。用它灌溉农田既顶水又顶粪。
    污泥
    污泥是由污水中沉淀下来的脏东西，其中含有0.24％的氮，0.46％的磷，1.22％的钾，它不仅是一种很好的肥料，而且在污泥中还可产生沼气。
