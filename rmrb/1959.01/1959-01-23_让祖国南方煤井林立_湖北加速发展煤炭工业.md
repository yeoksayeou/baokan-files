Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 22nd: Hubei Province's coal industry is implementing the method of combining modern (洋法) and indigenous (土法) production, and this year will see an even greater leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward.

According to arrangements already made by the province, coal industrial departments throughout the province are currently actively engaged in the construction of large-scale, modern coal production bases. Four of the province's five modern, large-scale coal production bases have already begun construction, and one is under preparation. Once these bases are completed and put into production, the province's coal production will see a substantial increase.

While building large-scale coal bases, in order to meet the needs of industrial production for coal as soon as possible, the relevant departments in Hubei Province are also focusing on the technical transformation of small coal kilns with great effort. During the Great Leap Forward in steel production last year, Hubei Province built a large number of small coal kilns. At the beginning, most of these small coal kilns were mined manually. Now, as long as some technical transformations are made in tunneling, coal mining, drainage, hoisting, and transportation, labor conditions can be greatly improved and production levels can be raised. In this regard, some areas have already mobilized the masses to take active action and have achieved good results. For example, the Jinchengshan Coal Mine in Chongyang County vigorously mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations, successfully trial-produced four kinds of tools: a chain-plate foot-pedal conveyor, a hand-cranked single-wire pulley, a foot-pedal double-wire winch, and an automatic scale, which basically eliminated the phenomenon of shoulder carrying and human carrying in the past, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved. In addition, this mine has also connected these four tools with its own made wooden mine carts and earthen railways, thus basically realizing the semi-mechanization of the production process from coal mining and hoisting to transportation. The mine's current daily output has jumped from more than ten tons to one hundred and fifty tons. Zigui County has also implemented wooden track trolley transportation in forty-three small mines. Some mines have also widened and heightened the roadways, built drainage ditches, vigorously erected pulleys, built chutes, and improved external transportation, so the output has also increased significantly.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the coal industry, special districts in Hubei Province have established organizations dedicated to managing the coal industry in accordance with the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The province's twenty-nine people's communes responsible for coal production have also been equipped with Party committee secretaries in charge of coal production, and special organizations have been established to strengthen leadership.

### 让祖国南方煤井林立  湖北加速发展煤炭工业

    让祖国南方煤井林立
    湖北加速发展煤炭工业
    新华社武汉22日电　湖北省煤炭工业贯彻执行洋法生产和土法生产并举的方法，今年将在去年大跃进的基础上出现更大的跃进。
    根据省里已经作出的安排，全省煤炭工业部门目前正在积极进行大型、洋法生产的煤炭基地的建设。全省五个洋法生产的大型煤炭基地有四个已经动工，一个正在筹建。这些基地建成投入生产以后，将使全省煤炭产量有很大的增长。
    在建设大型煤炭基地的同时，为了尽快满足全省工业生产对于煤炭的需要，湖北省有关部门又以很大力量抓紧小煤窑的技术改造。去年大办钢铁时，湖北省建设了大量小煤窑。这些小煤窑开始时绝大部分都是手工开采，现在只要在掘进、采煤、排水、提升、运输等方面稍加技术改造，就能大大改善劳动条件，提高生产水平。在这方面，目前有些地区已经发动群众积极行动起来，并取得了很好的效果。如崇阳县金城山煤矿大力发动群众开展技术革新，试制成功了链板脚踏运输机、手绞单线滑丝、脚踏双线绞车和自动磅秤等四种工具，基本上消灭了过去的肩挑人驮现象，劳动效率已大大提高。另外，这个矿还把这四种工具和自己制作的人推木制矿车、土铁路联结起来，从而基本上实现了从挖煤、提升到运输的生产过程半机械化。这个矿目前的日产量由十多吨跃增到一百五十吨。秭归县也已经有四十三个小矿实行了木轨道拖车运输，有些矿井还加宽加高了巷道，建筑了排水沟，同时大力架设滑丝，修筑溜槽，改进井外运输，因此产量也显著提高。
    为了加强对煤炭工业的领导，湖北省各专区已经根据中共湖北省委的指示，建立起专管煤炭工业的机构；全省二十九个负有产煤任务的人民公社，也已配备管煤炭生产的党委书记，并且设立了专门机构加强领导。
