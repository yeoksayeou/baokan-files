Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 18th: The joint statement issued here today by the Czechoslovak and Albanian Party and Government Delegations points out that the decisive factor in the current international situation is the broad and continuous development of the world socialist system. It is indisputably superior to the capitalist system.

The two delegations believe that the key issue in the current international situation is to stop the mad arms race, first of all to permanently cease nuclear weapons testing, ban the production and use of these weapons, and destroy the stockpiles of these weapons. The two countries also fully support the Soviet proposal for an immediate, permanent, and unconditional cessation of experimental nuclear explosions. The two delegations also demand the immediate resumption of the meeting of experts in Geneva to discuss measures to prevent surprise attacks.

The statement said that the two delegations fully agree with the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city and fully support the Soviet proposal for concluding a peace treaty with Germany. They believe this is another significant initiative by the Soviet government to eliminate a dangerous hotbed of war in Europe. Czechoslovakia and Albania will do everything possible to promote the convening of a peace conference and to ensure that the conference completes its mission.

The statement points out that the two parties believe that their primary internationalist duty is to make every effort to strengthen the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the unity of the entire international communist movement. The two parties will continue to resolutely safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism and resolutely struggle against the mortal enemies of the international workers' movement—modern revisionism. This revisionism is clearly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the policies of the Yugoslav communist leadership.

The statement continued that the two delegations fully support the just struggle of the People's Republic of China for the final liberation of all of China's territory and resolutely condemn the United States' interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese government.

The two delegations expressed their full support for the struggle of Asian and African countries for national liberation and resolutely condemned the colonial policies of the imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France.

The two delegations condemned the policies of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and reiterated their countries' commitment to the obligations assumed under the Warsaw Treaty.

The statement concluded by pointing out that the cooperative relations between Czechoslovakia and Albania have developed comprehensively. The two delegations also reached agreement on some measures to further strengthen bilateral relations during the talks.

The talks between the two delegations were conducted in a spirit of complete agreement, and in an atmosphere of sincerity, friendship, and mutual understanding.
