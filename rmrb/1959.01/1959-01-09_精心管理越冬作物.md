Hebei Province Universally Applies Fertilizer and Covers Manure to Wheat Fields
Anhui Bengbu Prefecture Prevents Wheat Rust in Seedling Stage
Jiangsu Jiangning Organizes Professional Teams for Comprehensive Management
Guangxi Nandan and Quan County Strengthen Field Care

According to the Hebei Daily: A mass movement to apply fertilizer, cover manure, and water with urine to wheat fields has been fully launched across Hebei Province. By the end of last year, 21.5 million mu of wheat fields across the province had been covered with manure and fertilizer, and nearly 6 million mu had been watered with urine.

Since late December of last year, various regions in Hebei have successively shifted the focus of wheat field management to covering manure, applying fertilizer, and watering with urine. To promote this work, Handan and Shijiazhuang Prefectures, as well as many counties, conducted an in-depth evaluation and inspection of wheat field management. After the evaluation and inspection in Handan Prefecture, the daily progress of fertilizing wheat fields increased from 120,000 mu to 400,000 mu. The inspection also overcame the blindly optimistic sentiment of some cadres and commune members. In Henan Dian, She County, after a round of fertilization, many cadres and masses became complacent. The Party branch mobilized the masses to calculate the accounts. The commune's more than 56,000 mu of wheat required 150,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to guarantee the planned yield, but only 10,000 jin of fertilizer were available per mu. After this calculation, a fertilizer accumulation campaign was immediately launched throughout the village.

In order to prepare sufficient fertilizer for covering and applying to wheat fields, various regions widely launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign while covering and applying fertilizer to wheat fields. Handan Prefecture established 20,440 professional fertilizer accumulation teams, and the entire prefecture has accumulated 115.8 billion jin of fertilizer. Xingtai County widely mobilized the masses to carry out the "Five Digs" (pigpens, thatched walls, river mud, chicken and duck nests) and "Two Scrapes" (wall plaster, saltpeter soil) fertilizer accumulation campaign, and has now accumulated 15.1 billion jin of fertilizer.

According to the Anhui Daily: Bengbu Prefecture in Anhui Province is universally carrying out the inspection and prevention of wheat rust in the seedling stage.

In early and mid-December last year, wheat rust spores were successively discovered in parts of Xiao County, Dangshan County, Su County, Huaiyuan County, Si County, Fengyang County, Wuhe County, and Binghui County in Bengbu Prefecture. The Bengbu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to the above situation and promptly issued an emergency notice, requiring all localities to quickly mobilize the masses to conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of all wheat fields in conjunction with winter irrigation and fertilization. Any fields found to have rust should be marked with signs and quickly treated to eliminate the overwintering rust spores.

All localities in the prefecture quickly mobilized the masses to carry out rust inspection and prevention work, and adopted a method of simultaneous inspection and prevention to eliminate rust. Sanwan Brigade of Dongfeng Commune in Su County found rust in 30 mu of wheat fields and immediately sprayed them all over with a "cat's eye" sprayer. Dangshan County found rust in more than 2,300 mu of wheat fields and immediately organized more than 1,300 people to spray lime-sulfur mixture for prevention. Nearly 5,000 mu of wheat fields have been treated throughout the district.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 8th: Under the slogan of "Comprehensive Management, High Yield in Everything," the people's communes in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, have strengthened field management of overwintering crops such as wheat, barley, yuan wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure. As of January 4, the county's 450,000 mu of three wheats had generally been fertilized once or twice; among the 43,000 mu of rapeseed, more than 90% had been fertilized once, and more than 30% had been fertilized twice. More than 200,000 mu of broad beans and green manure are also being top-dressed with plant ash, soil is being added to the roots, increasing cold resistance, and promoting growth.

Some time ago, the Jiangning County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a comprehensive inspection of overwintering crops and found that many cadres and the masses had the idea of "emphasizing three wheats, neglecting miscellaneous grains." Some rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure were weak and yellow due to poor management. The County Committee believes that rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure, which account for 50% of the total area of summer crops in the county, cannot guarantee a comprehensive leap forward in this year's summer crops if overwintering management is not done well. The Jiangning County Committee of the Communist Party of China then put forward the slogan of "Comprehensive Management, High Yield in Everything," requiring all people's communes to manage rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure well while continuing to strengthen the management of three wheats.

According to the instructions of the County Committee, the people's communes, after mobilizing commune members for discussion, established the comprehensive development concept of treating three wheats, rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure equally, and universally revised the management plan for summer crops. All three wheats, rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure were all implemented with a responsibility system of assigning people, fields, management quality, and output. Thirty thousand people in the county have formed professional teams, and have successively invested in the overwintering management of various summer crops, ensuring a successful first summer harvest after communization.

According to the Guangxi Daily: Quan County and Nandan in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are actively strengthening field care of winter crops.

Quan County has more than 85,000 mu of winter wheat and 33,500 mu of rapeseed. In order to ensure a bumper harvest of winter crops, the eleven communes in this county have assigned special personnel to be responsible for leading this work. Each commune also ranked the winter crops in the fields by brigade, and provided care according to the different growth conditions of the crops. For example, after field ranking, Miaotou Commune found that 193 mu of wheat and 180 mu of rapeseed had not opened drainage ditches, and immediately organized 280 people to launch a sudden attack for one day, supplementing all the drainage ditches for 373 mu of wheat and rapeseed fields, ensuring that these crops were not flooded. Qiyi Commune promptly organized more than 300 people to carry out cultivation and weeding at one go for two days, applying five to six dan of fertilizer per mu, so that the Class III wheat and rapeseed quickly caught up with Class I.

Due to the strengthening of care, wheat seedlings in Nandan generally grew well. In order to ensure the realization of the target of 1,500 jin of wheat per mu, and strive for a large-area high-yield target of 2,000 jin, the Party committees of various people's communes in Nandan County first organized the masses to carry out a large-scale debate on field care. Through debate, the masses' understanding of field care was improved. By the end of last year, 11,700 mu of wheat fields in the county had been cultivated, and 8,560 mu had been fertilized, with an average of 49 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. The Yang Longzhen satellite field management team of Chengguan Brigade, Xiaochang Red Flag People's Commune, in order to ensure that the 2.5 mu of wheat satellite field achieved a high-yield record of 10,000 jin per mu, has now applied 100 dan of manure per mu, and watered it every three days, so that the wheat seedlings get sufficient water.

    精心管理越冬作物
    河北各地普遍给麦田追肥盖粪
    安徽蚌埠专区防治苗期麦锈病
    江苏江宁组织专业队全面管理
    广西南丹和全县加强田间护理
    据河北日报消息　一个群众性的给小麦追肥、盖肥和浇尿活动已在河北省各地全面展开。在去年年底以前，全省麦田已盖粪追肥二千一百五十万亩，浇尿近六百万亩。
    从去年12月下旬开始，河北各地相继把麦田管理的中心及时地转到盖粪、追肥、浇尿等方面来。为了推动这项工作，邯郸、石家庄专区以及许多县，深入地进行了一次麦田管理评比大检查。邯郸专区经过评比检查后，麦田铺肥日进度由过去的十二万亩提高到四十万亩。经过检查也克服了一些干部和社员的盲目乐观情绪。涉县河南店麦田普遍追了一次肥，不少干部群众就自满起来了，党支部发动群众算了个账，全社五万六千多亩小麦，按计划产量要求，每亩必须有十五万斤肥料才能保证，现在每亩麦田仅有一万多斤肥，还差很多。这样算账以后，全村立即发动起积肥运动。
    为了给麦田盖肥铺肥准备下足够的肥料，各地在麦田铺肥、追肥的同时，广泛开展起了积肥运动。邯郸专区建立起积肥专业队二万零四百四十个，全区已积肥一千一百五十八亿斤。邢台县广泛发动群众，开展了“五挖”（猪圈，茅墙，河泥，鸡、鸭窝）、“二刮”（墙皮、硝土）积肥运动，现在已积肥一百五十一亿斤。
    据安徽日报消息　安徽省蚌埠专区普遍开展苗期小麦锈病的检查和防治工作。
    去年12月上、中旬，蚌埠专区萧县、砀山、宿县、怀远、泗县、凤阳、五河、炳辉等县部分地区，先后发现了小麦锈病菌。中共蚌埠地委对上述情况极为重视，及时发出紧急通知，要求各地迅速发动群众，结合冬灌和施肥，对所有麦田进行普遍、彻底的检查，发现有锈病的田块，应插牌立标，抓紧防治，消灭越冬的锈病菌源。
    全专区各地都迅速发动群众进行锈病的检查和防治工作，并采取边检查边防治办法，消灭锈病。宿县东风公社三湾大队查出三十亩麦田有锈病，立即用猫耳眼水全部喷洒一遍。砀山县查出有锈病的麦田二千三百多亩，立即组织一千三百多人，喷洒石灰硫磺合剂防治。全区已防治麦田近五千亩。
    据新华社南京8日电　江苏省江宁县各人民公社，在“全面管理，样样高产”的口号下，对小麦、大麦、元麦、油菜、蚕豌豆和绿肥等越冬作物都加强了田间管理。到1月4日止，全县四十五万亩三麦已普遍追肥一次到二次，四万三千多亩油菜中，追肥一次的占90％以上，追肥二次的占30％以上；二十多万亩蚕豌豆和绿肥也正在追施草木灰，培土壅根，增加御寒能力，促进生长。
    中共江宁县委前些时候对越冬作物作了全面检查，发现不少干部和群众存在着“重三麦，轻杂粮”的思想。部分油菜、蚕豌豆和绿肥因管理不善，苗棵已瘦弱发黄。县委认为，占全县夏熟作物总面积50％的油菜、蚕豌豆、绿肥，如不搞好越冬管理，就不能够保证今年夏熟作物的全面跃进。中共江宁县委便提出“全面管理，样样高产”的口号，要求各人民公社在继续加强三麦管理的同时，管好油菜、蚕豌豆和绿肥。
    各人民公社根据县委指示，经过发动社员讨论，确立了对三麦、油菜、蚕豌豆和绿肥一视同仁的全面发展观点，普遍修订了夏熟作物的管理计划，对三麦、油菜、蚕豌豆和绿肥全部实行定人、定田、定管理质量、定产量的责任制。全县有三万人组成了专业队，先后投入各项夏熟作物的越冬管理，保证打好公社化后第一个夏熟丰收仗。
    据广西日报消息　广西僮族自治区的全县和南丹积极加强冬种作物的田间护理。
    全县冬种作物中有小麦八万五千多亩，油菜三万三千五百亩。为了保证冬种作物大丰收，这个县的十一个公社都分别指派专人负责领导这一工作。各公社还以大队为单位对冬种作物进行了田头排队，根据作物不同生长情况，分别加以护理。如庙头公社通过田头排队，发现有一百九十三亩小麦和一百八十亩油菜没有开排水沟，便立即组织二百八十人突击一天，将三百七十三亩小麦、油菜田全部补开了排水沟，保证这些作物免遭水淹。七一公社及时组织三百多人突击两天，全部中耕除草一次，每亩施下肥料五至六担，使三类小麦、油菜迅速赶上一类。
    南丹由于加强护理，麦苗普遍生长良好。为了保证实现小麦亩产一千五百斤，争取二千斤的大面积高产指标，南丹县各人民公社党委首先组织了群众开展田间护理大辩论，通过辩论，提高了群众对田间护理的认识。至去年年底止，全县麦田中耕已达一万一千七百亩，追肥八千五百六十亩，平均每亩追肥四十九担。小场红旗人民公社城关大队杨隆珍卫星田管理小组为了保证二点五亩的小麦卫星田实现亩产万斤的高产纪录，现在每亩已经追一百担大粪，并且每隔三天浇一次水，使麦苗得到充足的水分。
