Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th. According to figures released today by the British Iron and Steel Board, Britain's steel production in 1958 decreased by 11.5% compared to 1957.

    In 1958, Britain's steel production was 19.57 million tons, with an average weekly production of 369,200 tons – a decrease of 11.5% compared to the weekly production in 1957.

    The weekly production in December was 314,000 tons, a decrease of 21.1% compared to the weekly production in December 1957.

    The main reason for the decline in steel production is the decline in heavy industrial production. The amount of deliveries from the steel industry to heavy industries such as the coal mining industry, railways, and construction projects has been greatly reduced. The amount of steel provided by the steel industry to these industries, as well as to the shipbuilding industry and to manufacturers of products such as screws and nuts, has decreased by about one-third compared to the previous year.

    In 1958, Britain's production of milled iron was 13 million tons, a decrease of 11% in average weekly production compared to 1957.

    The production situation of the steel industry deteriorated continuously in 1958. The output in the last quarter of the year only reached 75% of production capacity, while it was 77% in the third quarter, 85% in the second quarter, and 83% in the first quarter.

    During the year, the demand for steel ingots is estimated to have decreased by 2.4 million tons. Among these, 1.75 million tons were due to the reduction in domestic sales. Direct and indirect exports of steel have also declined.

    The prospects for steel industry production in 1959 do not look good. The demand for steel from the coal mining industry and the shipbuilding industry is expected to decline further this year. The cessation of railway freight car construction plans will result in a demand for steel that is 150,000 tons less than in 1958.

### 英国钢铁业一年不如一年  去年钢产量比前年减少11.5％  今年生产预计还将进一步下降

    英国钢铁业一年不如一年
    去年钢产量比前年减少11.5％
    今年生产预计还将进一步下降
    新华社伦敦15日电　据英国钢铁局今天发表的数字，1958年英国的钢产量比1957年降低了11.5％。
    1958年英国的钢产量是一千九百五十七万吨，平均每周生产钢三十六万九千二百吨——比1957年的每周生产量下降了11.5％。
    12月份的每周生产量是三十一万四千吨，比1957年12月份的每周生产量下降了21.1％。
    钢产量下降的主要原因是重工业生产下降。钢铁工业对像采煤工业、铁路和建设工程这种重工业提供的交货量大大减少了。钢铁工业对于这些工业以及对于造船业和对于像螺丝钉、螺丝帽等产品的制造商所提供的钢的数量，比前一年下降了大约三分之一。
    1958年英国铣铁的产量是一千三百万吨，比1957年每周平均产量降低了11％。
    钢铁工业的生产情况在1958年是在不断恶化的。这一年最后一个季度的产量只达到生产能力的75％，而在第三季度为77％，第二季度为85％，第一季度为83％。
    在这一年中，对钢锭的需求估计降低了二百四十万吨。其中一百七十五万吨是由于国内销售量的缩小。钢的直接出口和间接出口也下降了。
    1959年钢铁工业生产的前景看来并不美妙。采煤工业和造船工业对钢的需求预料今年会进一步下降。铁路货车建造计划的停止将使对钢的需求比1958年少十五万吨。
