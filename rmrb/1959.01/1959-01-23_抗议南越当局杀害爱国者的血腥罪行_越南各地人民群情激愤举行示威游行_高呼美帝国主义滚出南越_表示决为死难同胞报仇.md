Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd: In Hanoi on the 21st, more than 13,000 workers, cadres, students, and artists successively held demonstrations and parades in the Hoan Kiem Lake area in the city center and in front of the Hanoi office of the International Commission, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' crime of killing more than 1,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp on December 1st of last year.

These 13,000 people were representatives sent by dozens of factories, institutions, and schools in Hanoi after holding separate protest meetings.

The demonstrators shouted slogans in front of the Hanoi office of the International Commission with great emotion, demanding "Yankee imperialism get out of South Vietnam!" and "Demand that the International Commission take emergency measures to stop the crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities!" The demonstrators expressed their determination to avenge the dead patriotic compatriots.

Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, also participated in the parade and handed a proposal to the负责人 [fù zé rén] person in charge of the Hanoi office of the International Commission on behalf of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor.

In the past two days, the Hanoi office of the International Commission has received 100 protest letters and a large number of collectively signed documents protesting the atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities.

People in Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, Nghe An, Hong Quang, Ha Dong, Son Tay and other places in Vietnam also held protest rallies and parades on the 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 21st: Today, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial continuing to condemn the crime of the South Vietnamese authorities in killing more than 1,000 political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The editorial said that the Phu Loi massacre is one of the most prominent events in the South Vietnamese authorities' numerous crimes. This is a serious consequence of Yankee imperialism's intervention in South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese authorities' policy of dependence on the United States.

The editorial said that the Phu Loi massacre once again proves that Yankee imperialism and its running dogs are the most ferocious enemies of the Vietnamese people. The editorial pointed out that the enemy's brutal crimes are a harbinger of their doom.

The editorial also said that the people demand that the South Vietnamese authorities disband all concentration camps, because they are gloomy hells where patriotic people are killed.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 21st: Today, the Albanian "Unity" newspaper published a commentary, angrily protesting the inhumane atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities in poisoning more than 1,000 political prisoners. The commentary stated that the Albanian people deeply sympathize with the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

The commentary pointed out that these more than 1,000 people were cruelly murdered simply because they opposed the traitorous regime, because they hoped to be free from the oppression of the colonialists and demanded to see the freedom and independence of their motherland.

The commentary emphasized that hunger, torture, and slaughter cannot suppress the will of the South Vietnamese patriotic fighters to turn their motherland into a peaceful and prosperous country. The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities can never destroy the South Vietnamese people's will to demand unification with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and their struggle to demand South Vietnam's independence from foreign rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 22nd: Today, Pyongyang newspapers firmly condemned the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam for poisoning more than 1,000 Vietnamese patriots under the instigation of Yankee imperialism.

The "Rodong Sinmun" commentary said: "This is not only a gross violation of the Geneva Accords, but also an extremely heinous crime against human conscience." The commentary said: "The Korean people resolutely condemn the Yankee aggressors for spreading the seeds of war wherever their beastly hooves tread, and demand an immediate end to this criminal act."

The commentary demanded that the International Commission in Vietnam, in accordance with its responsibility to monitor and supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords, thoroughly investigate the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's killing crime and take swift measures to save the Vietnamese patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp who have not yet been killed.

The commentary pointed out that in order to prevent similar tragedies from happening again and to realize the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, it is necessary to end the fascist rule of Yankee imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam.

The editorial published by "Minju Choson" said that this is "an indelible crime committed by the cannibalistic Yankee imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of the twentieth century." The editorial said: "The struggle of people facing extinction is tantamount to digging their own graves; repeated crimes will only hasten the day when the criminals are judged by the people."

    这一万多人是河内几十处工厂、机关、学校在分别举行了抗议集会后派出的代表。
    游行者在国际委员会河内办事处门前情绪激昂地高呼口号，要求“美帝国主义滚出南越！”“要求国际委员会采取紧急措施来制止南越当局的罪行！”游行者表示要为死难的爱国同胞报仇。
    越南总工会主席黄国越也参加了游行，他代表越南总工会把建议书交给了国际委员会河内办事处的负责人。
    国际委员会河内办事处两天来已经收到了一百封抗议书和大量集体签名的抗议南越当局暴行的文件。
    越南的海防、南定、宁平、义安、鸿广、河东、山西等地的人民群众21日也举行了抗议集会和游行。
    新华社河内21日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论继续谴责南越当局杀害富利集中营一千多名政治犯的罪行。
    社论说，富利惨案是吴庭艳当局的大量罪行中最突出的事件之一。这是美帝国主义干涉南越和南越当局依附美国的政策所带来的严重后果。
    社论说，富利惨案再一次证明，美帝国主义和它的走狗是越南人民最凶恶的敌人。社论指出，敌人残暴的罪行正是它们日暮途穷的预兆。
    社论还说，人民要求南越当局解散一切集中营，因为那里是杀害爱国人士的阴森地狱。

    评论指出，残酷地杀害这一千多人，只是因为他们反对卖国政权，因为他们希望不受殖民者的压迫和要求看到自己祖国的自由和独立。
    评论着重说，饥饿、拷打和屠杀压制不了南越爱国志士要把自己的祖国变为和平和繁荣的国家的意志。吴庭艳当局永远也不能摧毁南越人民要求和越南民主共和国统一的意志和要求南越脱离外国统治的斗争。
    新华社平壤22日电　平壤各报今天坚决谴责南越吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义指使下，毒死一千多名越南爱国者的滔天罪行。
    “劳动新闻”的评论说：“这不仅是对日内瓦协议的粗暴违反，而且是违背人类良心的极其可恶的罪行”。评论说：“朝鲜人民坚决谴责美国侵略者在他们的兽蹄所到之处，散播战争种子的犯罪行为，并要求立即停止这种犯罪行动。”
    评论要求越南国际委员会根据它监察和监督履行日内瓦协议的责任，彻底调查吴庭艳集团这次杀人罪行，并迅速采取措施拯救在富利集中营里尚未遭到杀害的越南爱国者。
    评论指出，为使不再发生类似的惨案、实现越南的和平统一，必须结束美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团在南越的法西斯统治。
    “民主朝鲜报”发表的社论说，这是“二十世纪吃人生番的美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团犯下的永远洗不掉的罪行”。社论说：“面临灭亡的人的挣扎，等于自掘坟墓；屡犯罪行，只会促使罪犯们受到人民审判的日子提早到来。”
