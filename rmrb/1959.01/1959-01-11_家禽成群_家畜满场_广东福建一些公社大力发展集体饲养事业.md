Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: After Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, vigorously developed collective poultry and livestock breeding last year, the number of poultry and livestock increased rapidly. The number of poultry in the county increased by more than 60% in the second half of last year compared with the first half of the year, and nearly doubled compared with 1957, reaching 6,527,000, an average of 50 per household. The number of pigs in the county increased by more than 50% in the second half of last year compared with the first half of the year, and 116% compared with 1957, with a total of 282,000, an average of 2.2 per household.

The unprecedented development of poultry and pigs in Qingyuan County last year strongly supported national construction and improved the lives of commune members. The income from selling chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs increased by more than 3.64 million yuan throughout the year. The income of more than 1.18 million yuan in the fourth quarter was equivalent to one-third of the total wages paid by the commune in November and December last year. Many poultry were used for self-slaughter and consumption, directly improving the lives of commune members.

Qingyuan County relied on the masses to use simple and local methods to set up more than 5,100 livestock (poultry) farms. These breeding farms were mainly established in the second half of last year. Among them, in addition to two large-scale demonstration livestock farms and more than 50 medium-sized farms, the remaining 99% are small-scale poultry farms raising 400 to 700 poultry (some even less). These poultry farms were built by adapting to local conditions, using local materials, being as simple as possible, and using the vicinity of rivers, mountains, and scattered houses or mobilizing the masses to donate small amounts of old materials and collect thatch and bamboo. Many local methods were also used in breeding poultry and disease prevention. This kind of poultry farm, which is small in scale, requires less investment, takes less time, and yields quick results, can most extensively mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the production technology is easily mastered by the masses, so it can meet the needs of greatly developing poultry and livestock production under the current conditions in rural areas. For example, after the original Shantung Township adopted the above methods, it established 107 poultry farms in only five days, and the number of poultry raised in the township has increased more than threefold in the last six months.

These breeding farms implement a method of specialized personnel, specialized responsibility, grouping, division by size, and division by male and female for breeding, and poultry and livestock have developed rapidly, are well-raised, and have a high survival rate. They generally keep mothers for breeding, do not eat seed eggs, and have established 350 hatcheries to carry out large-scale breeding in a planned manner. Advanced breeding technology and epidemic prevention and health work have been promoted very well. A total of 66 veterinary service stations have been established in the county, and more than 2,000 veterinarians or epidemic prevention personnel have been trained, realizing that every township has a station and every team has an epidemic prevention worker. Therefore, last year, 540,000 chickens were injected with plague vaccine (excluding eye drops for chicks), which was ten times more than in 1957. At the same time, breeding technologies such as removing chicken thyroid glands were promoted, and various advanced management systems were implemented, greatly promoting the development of production.

At present, in addition to collective breeding of poultry and livestock, commune members in Qingyuan County also raise a small amount individually, provided that it does not hinder collective labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 10th: Some people's communes in Fujian Province are vigorously developing collective poultry farming and encouraging commune members to raise poultry individually, which has resulted in chickens and ducks multiplying, even several times over.

In the development of chicken and duck farming, many people's communes have uniformly arranged collective and individual poultry farming for commune members. The Rocket Commune in Changtai County adopted the method of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains and raising poultry with the mountains." The entire commune collectively raised 2,055 chickens, more than three times the number in the same period last year; commune members individually raised 17,200 chickens, which was also a large increase compared with the same period last year. Commune members of the Chiyu Brigade of the Red Flag Commune in Changle County kept the hens and the 900 eggs that were recently laid to hatch chicks. The commune also purchased 600 chicks and goslings from other places for collective breeding.

These people's communes all pay attention to solving problems such as arranging labor time and supplying feed in poultry farming. The Jinjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China specially convened a poultry production meeting, instructing all people's communes to properly arrange the feed, labor, and time required for commune members to raise poultry. In addition to the commune members solving the feed needed for their own poultry raising, the insufficient part is included in the commune's plan. Some by-products of the commune that can be used as feed are uniformly distributed according to the feed required by the commune, brigades, and commune members. The Luqian Team of the Shenghuang Commune in Minqing County uses pine needles to cultivate white ants as poultry feed. Now the chickens and ducks raised by the entire team average three and a half per household, and they are growing very fat. Ducks grow more than three catties in two months, and chickens grow about two catties. The Chongtian Commune in Taining buys ducklings and contracts them to commune members for raising. For every 100 ducks, the commune supplies 150 catties of feed. After the ducks grow up, they hand in 200 catties of clean ducks to the commune. The excess is used as a reward. After implementing this method, the entire commune has raised more than 25,300 ducks, an average of five and a half per person.

    家禽成群  家畜满场
    广东福建一些公社大力发展集体饲养事业
    新华社广州10日电　广东清远县去年大力发展家禽家畜集体饲养业以后，家禽家畜头数迅速增加。全县家禽去年下半年比上半年增加了60％多，全年比1957年增加了近一倍，饲养数达到六百五十二万七千多只，平均每户五十只。全县生猪去年下半年比上半年增加了50％多，全年比1957年增加了116％，总头数达到二十八万二千头，平均每户二点二头。
    清远县去年家禽和生猪的空前发展，有力地支援了国家建设和改善了社员的生活。全年从出售鸡、鸭、鹅、猪中，便增加了三百六十四万多元的收入。第四季度收入的一百一十八万多元，就相当于公社发放去年11月和12月工资总额的三分之一。许多家禽用来自宰自食，直接改善了社员的生活。
    清远县依靠群众用穷办法、土办法办起了五千一百多个畜牧（禽）场。这些饲养场主要是在去年下半年办起来的。其中，除了有两个大型的示范性畜牧场和五十多个中型场以外，其余99％都是养禽四百只（有些还要少）到七百只的小型禽场。这些禽场都是因地制宜、就地取材、因陋就简、利用近河边、山边和分散的房舍或发动群众捐献零星旧料和搜集茅草、竹料建成的。在繁殖种禽和防疫方法上也采用了不少土办法。这种规模小、投资少、费时短、收效快的禽场，因为能够最广泛地动员广大群众的生产积极性，生产技术又容易为群众掌握，因而能适应农村目前条件下大大发展禽畜生产的需要。例如原山塘乡采用以上的办法以后，仅五天时间就建立禽场一百零七个，全乡饲养家禽的数量在最近六个月内增加了三倍多。
    这些饲养场实行专人、专责、分群、分大小和分公母的方法进行饲养，家禽家畜发展得很快，养得肥，成活率也高。他们一般都是见母就留，种蛋不食，并建立起孵房三百五十个，有计划地大量地进行繁殖。先进的饲养技术和防疫卫生工作推行得很好。全县共建立有兽医服务站六十六个，培训兽医或防疫人员两千多人，实现了乡乡有站、队队有防疫员，因而去年注射瘟疫苗的鸡达到五十四万只（不包括幼雏滴眼），比1957年增加十倍，同时推广了割除鸡甲状腺等饲养技术和实行了各种先进管理制度，大大促进了生产的发展。
    目前，清远县除了实行集体饲养家禽家畜以外，社员个人在不妨碍集体劳动的条件下，也少量饲养。
    新华社福州10日电　福建省一些人民公社正在大力发展集体的家禽饲养业，同时鼓励社员个人饲养家禽，已使鸡鸭成倍地甚至好几倍地发展起来。
    在发展鸡鸭饲养业中，不少人民公社都统一安排了集体的和社员个人的家禽饲养。长泰县火箭公社采取“靠山吃山，以山养禽”的办法，全社集体养鸡二千零五十五只，比去年同期增长了三倍多；社员个人养鸡一万七千二百只，比去年同期也有很大增长。长乐县红旗公社赤屿大队社员把母鸡和最近生的九百个鸡蛋都留了下来，留着孵小鸡，社里也向外地采购了六百只小鸡小鹅，集体饲养。
    这些人民公社都注意解决家禽饲养中的劳动时间安排和饲料供应等问题。中共晋江地委专门召开了家禽生产会议，指示各人民公社对于社员饲养家禽所需的饲料、劳力、时间都要妥善安排。社员自养家禽所需饲料，除了社员自己解决以外，不足部分纳入公社规划。公社的一些可以作饲料的副产品，按公社、大队、社员所需的饲料统一分配。闽清县省璜公社炉前队用松叶等来培育白蚂蚁，作为家禽饲料，现在全队养的鸡鸭平均每户已有三只半，而且长得很肥，两个月鸭子就长了三斤多重，鸡长了两斤左右。泰宁冲天公社买小鸭包给社员饲养，每百只鸭由社供给一百五十斤饲料，在鸭群成长后交社净鸭两百斤，超额部分作为奖励，实行这个办法以后，全社已养鸭二万五千三百多只，平均每人五只半。
