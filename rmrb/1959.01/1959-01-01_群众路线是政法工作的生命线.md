The mass line is the lifeline of political and legal work. This is a profound realization we have gained in our practical work over the past year. In our court, some comrades, influenced by the old legal system in the past, are accustomed to sitting in court and hearing cases. When it comes to going deep into the masses to handle cases, they believe that running around will inevitably affect the efficiency of handling cases; some are afraid of losing face if they don't handle cases well in front of the masses. All these are manifestations of distrust in the masses. Through the great rectification movement and the encouragement of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, under the leadership of the Party, the comrades finally broke through this barrier and embarked on the road of carrying the files down, consulting with the masses, and relying on the masses to handle cases.

Since last spring, the judges of our court have, according to the circumstances of the case, given priority to the important and urgent cases, and according to the distribution of the cases, consulted with the masses in a timely manner. This not only facilitates the masses and ensures the smooth completion of the central work, but also makes it easier for the court to understand the situation in depth and obtain the support of the masses, and effectively resolve disputes. For example, in February of last year, we accepted a case where the plaintiff, Old Duan, said that An Aigui drove his lamb with purple eye circles, a tuft of black hair on the top of its head, and a triangular tail into An Aigui's flock of sheep. After the court accepted the case, after questioning the defendant and going deep into the masses to understand, it was proved that the defendant also had lambs with the same characteristics. The case handlers felt it was difficult to handle, so they went deep into the masses to ask for advice on how to deal with it. A veterinarian named Ma said: After a ewe gives birth to a lamb, before it gives birth again, the ewe and the lamb will definitely have intimate actions when they meet. Therefore, the case handlers, according to the method proposed by the veterinarian, tied the two ewes and lambs together, confirming that the lamb was indeed the defendant's, and the plaintiff sold his lamb and attempted to defraud the defendant. After the problem was solved, the masses reflected that the people's court really had a way, the handling was reasonable, and it could go deep into the masses to solve the problem. The plaintiff was satisfied, and the defendant was also convinced.

Due to the vigorous implementation of the mass line in the trial work over the past year, we have deeply realized that the mass line is the most effective and correct method for handling contradictions among the people. Due to the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the masses' legal awareness and policy level have been improved, and disputes have been reduced. The case acceptance rate in the second half of 1958 was greatly reduced, and there were no civil disputes in August and October.

Our deepest feeling is that we must rely on the leadership of the Party in our work, put ourselves among the masses, seize the masses' production gaps and rest to handle cases, and when handing over cases to the masses for handling, we must be organized and led, explain the nature of the cases and policy boundaries to the masses, and must adhere to reasoning.

At the end of 1958 and the beginning of the new year, we feel that the victory of 1958 was the victory of following the mass line. In 1959, we will unswervingly implement this line on the basis of victory to ensure that our work achieves greater success.

    群众路线是政法工作的生命线
    济南市历下区人民法院院长　于进渭
    群众路线是政法工作的生命线。这是我们一年来在实际工作中的深刻体会。在我们法院中，部分同志由于过去受了旧法的影响，总是习惯于坐堂问案。当一提到深入群众办案，他们便认为这样东跑西奔，必定影响办案效率；有的怕当着群众面案件办不好丢脸，这些都是不相信群众的表现。通过伟大的整风运动和工农业生产大跃进形势的鼓舞，在党的领导下，同志们终于冲破了这一关，走上了携卷下去，和群众商量，依靠群众办案的道路。
    去春以来，我院审判员都根据案情，分别轻重缓急，按案件分布地区，作到及时和群众商量办理。这样既便利群众，保证中心工作顺利完成，又便于法院深入了解情况并取得群众的支持，有效地解决纠纷。如去年2月间受理了这样一个案件：原告老段说，安阿贵将他的一只紫眼圈、头顶有撮黑毛、三角尾巴的羊羔，赶入了安阿贵的羊群。法院受理后，经过讯问被告和深入群众了解，证明被告也有同样特征的羊羔。办案人员感到很难处理，于是便深入群众请教处理办法。一位姓马的兽医说：母羊生小羊后，在未再生以前，母羊和羊羔相遇，定会发生亲昵动作。于是办案人员根据兽医提出的办法将两只母羊及羊羔牵在一起，证实了羊羔确是被告的，原告把自己的羊羔卖了，企图骗取被告的羊。问题解决后，群众反映人民法院真有办法，处理合理，又能深入群众解决。原告满意，被告也心服。
    由于一年来在审判工作中大力贯彻群众路线的办案方法，使我们深深体会到群众路线是处理人民内部矛盾最有效最正确的方法。由于正确处理了人民内部矛盾，提高了群众法制观念及政策水平，减少了纠纷，1958年下半年收案率大大降低，8、10两月份没有一件民事纠纷。
    我们最深的感受，是工作中必须依靠党的领导，把自己置身于群众之中，抓紧群众的生产空隙及休息进行办案，在把案件交给群众处理时必须有组织有领导，向群众说明案件性质及政策界线，必须坚持说理。
    在1958年结束，新的一年开始的时候，我们觉得1958年的胜利，就是走群众路线的胜利，1959年将在胜利的基础上，坚定不移地贯彻这一路线，保证我们的工作取得更大的成就。
