Wheat, Rice and Coarse Grains Rise Wave Upon Wave
——An Introduction to the Grain Room of the Crop Hall at the National Agricultural Exhibition
By our reporter Su Qun

With boundless excitement, I stepped into the Grain Room of the Crop Hall at the National Agricultural Exhibition. Here, it felt like being in a field of abundant harvest, a scene of "bumper harvests" unfolding before your eyes. The exhibits competed in beauty, each displaying its unique splendor: wheat with thick stalks, large ears, and plump grains; rice with large ears and full grains; golden corn, shining, more than a foot long, weighing over a pound; and so on. These exhibits from all over the country collectively reflected that in 1958, China's grain crops achieved unprecedented bumper harvests.

High-Speed Leap Forward

At the entrance of this room, I was drawn to the golden grain bins. At the center of this bin was a brilliant red arrow and number: In 1958, the total national grain output reached approximately 750 billion jin, an increase of more than double that of 1957, and nearly two and a half times that of 1949. The increase in national grain output in 1958 alone was more than six times the total cumulative increase during the entire First Five-Year Plan (61.2 billion jin). The average grain yield per mu in 1958 was approximately 410 jin, more than double that of 1957. A walk through this room allows one to see the situation in which China's agricultural Great Leap Forward is developing wave upon wave, each higher than the last.

Wheat, taking the lead in the leap forward, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In 1958, 400 million mu of wheat were sown nationwide, with a total output of 80 billion jin and an average yield of up to 200 jin per mu. The total wheat output increased by 69% compared to 1957, with the increase in this one year exceeding the total increase from 1949 to 1957. The average wheat yield per mu increased by 75% in 1958 compared to 1957. Due to the high-speed leap forward and large-scale bumper harvest of wheat, the traditional view of wheat as a "low-yield crop" has been overturned, and the total wheat output has surpassed that of the United States, known as the "Wheat Kingdom," ranking second in the world.

Inspired by the heroic slogans of "Early Rice Surpassing Wheat" and "Late Rice Surpassing Early Rice," rice spread its wings and soared, continuing to lead the world in total output. In 1958, 480 million mu of rice were sown nationwide, with a total output of approximately 300 billion jin and an average yield of up to 620 jin per mu. The total output in one year was equivalent to 80% of the total national grain output in 1957. The speed of the leap forward in total rice output and average yield per mu was very high. In 1958, the total rice output increased by 73% compared to 1957 and 208% compared to 1949. Several provinces in the country achieved yields of over 1,000 jin per mu.

Under the slogan of "Promoting Autumn with Summer," diverse coarse grains also experienced a leap forward. In 1958, the total national corn output reached approximately 90 billion jin, more than doubling that of 1957. The total national millet output reached approximately 30 billion jin, an increase of 75% compared to 1957. The total national sorghum output reached approximately 18 billion jin, an increase of 18% compared to 1957, with an average yield per mu increasing by 95% compared to 1957. The total output of potato crops in 1958 increased by 334% compared to 1957, with an average yield per mu increasing by 172% compared to 1957.

Seeing these rapidly increasing figures, one cannot help but be proud of the high-speed development of China's grain production and think of how many grassroots cadres and leaders spent sleepless nights for it, how many farmers shed sweat and devoted their efforts to it, how many workers contributed their strength to it, and how many commercial workers served it.... Thanks to their selfless labor, we basically achieved the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule.

Large-Scale High Yield
Red Flags Flutter Everywhere

In this room, people not only see the overall bumper harvest of grain crops but also see the red flags of large-scale high yields for various crops such as wheat, rice, corn, millet, sorghum, and potato crops. These high-yield red flags are planted all over the country, fluttering everywhere. Calculated by cultivated land area, three-quarters of the country's counties (cities, banners) have reached or exceeded the per-mu yield "4, 5, 8" target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program to be achieved within twelve years. In 1957, only more than 60 counties and cities achieved the "4, 5, 8" target nationwide.

"Low-yield crops" have turned over, and wheat red flags are waving in the wind. Dunhuang County in Zhangye Prefecture, Gansu Province, located in the Hexi Corridor on the Gobi Desert, achieved an average yield of 1,037 jin per mu for its 66,000 mu of spring wheat. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of Meng County, Henan Province, exerted revolutionary effort and vigorously tackled the four challenges of "drought, frost, pests, and rain," enabling the county's 25,800 mu of winter wheat to leap from an average yield of 172 jin per mu in 1957 to a bumper harvest of 500 jin per mu. An'guo County in Hebei Province, by implementing garden-style wheat cultivation, deep plowing, and meticulous cultivation, achieved an average yield of 491 jin per mu for its 180,000 mu of winter wheat. In Gucheng County, Hubei Province, a cotton-wheat double-cropping area, the county's 254,000 mu of winter wheat achieved an average yield of 621 jin per mu.

The provinces that planted thousand-jin red flags for rice include Hubei, Henan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces. Many rice-growing areas and remote alpine regions have also planted red flags for large areas of rice.

Shanxi Province planted more than 7.04 million mu of corn, with an average yield of 810 jin per mu, more than three times the highest corn yield in history in 1954. Shou'zhang County in Shandong Province achieved a large-scale bumper harvest on 120,000 mu of corn, with a yield per mu increasing tenfold compared to 1957. Changge County in Henan Province and Bachu County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have become red flag counties for 2,000 jin and 1,000 jin of corn, respectively. In Fan County, Shandong Province, more than 164,000 mu of spring millet increased by more than tenfold compared to 1957. In Funing County, Hebei Province, at the foot of the Great Wall, more than 107,000 mu of multi-eared sorghum achieved an average yield of more than 1,300 jin per mu. In Chenxian Prefecture, Hunan Province, more than 400,000 mu of sweet potatoes achieved an average yield of more than 16,000 jin per mu. In Yanbei Prefecture, Shanxi Province, more than 1 million mu of potatoes achieved a high yield of more than 2,100 jin per mu due to the promotion of high-yielding varieties and, in particular, the encirclement and annihilation of late blight. In Yulin Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, the total grain output in 1958 reached more than 1.319 billion jin, more than three times that of 1957.

Tremendous Significance

The overall Great Leap Forward and overall bumper harvest of grain crops have significant economic implications, far-reaching political influence, and scientific theoretical value. In 1958, the average grain possession per person reached approximately 1,200 jin. Many people's communes in rural areas have already implemented "eating without money." In a large country that accounts for a quarter of the world's population, the per capita grain possession has increased so rapidly in such a short period of time, which is a remarkable achievement! This fully refutes all fallacies that China's agricultural production cannot grow rapidly, and all tide-watching factions and after-the-fact accounting factions have also completely failed. Ten years ago, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson asserted in the "White Paper" that China had no way to solve its economic problems, that its population was too large, a "crushing pressure," and that "no government has succeeded in solving the problem of feeding the people." Now, ironclad facts prove that this argument has also completely gone bankrupt. This fact once again eloquently proves that the socialist system has great vitality and incomparable superiority over the capitalist system.

People who visit here will clearly understand that the agricultural Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest have found a high-speed development path for China's agricultural production. The emergence of large-scale high-yield fields demonstrates that China's agricultural production has endless potential, and we have every reason to implement deep plowing and meticulous cultivation on the basis of carrying out large-scale high-yield field campaigns, planting less and harvesting more. With the solution of the grain problem, we will gradually increase the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, hemp, silk, soybeans, oilseeds, sugar crops, tea, tobacco, and medicinal materials in the total agricultural production, and accelerate the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This provides conditions for a comprehensive revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and thoroughly changes the face of the entire agricultural front.

The Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest of grain crops have promoted and will more rapidly promote the rapid development of China's entire economic and cultural construction. Agriculture is an important source of industrial raw materials and capital, and rural areas are a broad market for industrial products. The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production not only stimulates and promotes industry, accelerating its development to meet the needs of the agricultural Great Leap Forward, but also creates conditions for farmers to run industries. During the nationwide steel-making campaign, haven't the farmers drawn a powerful force and transferred it to the industrial front? The hundreds of thousands of "small native furnace clusters" that have emerged in various places are mainly built by relying on the strength of the farmers. The advance and over-fulfillment of 10.07 million tons of steel includes the fruits of farmers' labor. The bumper harvest in agriculture has also provided solid material conditions for the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, and therefore, a magnificent high tide of cultural construction has emerged in rural areas.

The agricultural Great Leap Forward has also promoted the development of agricultural scientific theory and opened up broad avenues for the development of new agricultural science. The "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection (plant protection), tools (tool reform), and management (field management), is the crystallization of the combination of theory and practice.

People who have visited the various grain crops here unanimously believe that they have achieved unprecedented and amazing miracles. However, people believe that the potential for grain production increase is still great; the average grain possession per person has not yet reached the 2,000 to 3,000 jin requirement put forward by the central government; the proportion of potato crops in the total grain output is large, and it is necessary to reduce the proportion of potato crops and increase the proportion of fine grains. This puts arduous tasks before the nation's 500 million farmers. The 500 million farmers, in the decisive year of the three years of hard work, and in the first year of production after the implementation of communization, are full of confidence in welcoming the new combat tasks put forward by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the people of the whole country, that the total grain output in 1959 should reach approximately 1050 billion jin, the total cotton output should reach approximately 100 million dan (lint cotton), and to leap forward better and more comprehensively, striving to create even greater miracles!

    麦稻和杂粮一浪高一浪
    ——全国农业展览会农作物馆粮食室介绍
    本报记者　苏群
    我怀着无限激动、兴奋的心情，走进了全国农业展览会农作物馆粮食室。到了这里好像置身在大丰收的田野中，“五谷丰登”的景象呈现在你的面前。展品争奇夺艳，各放异彩：有秆粗、穗大、籽粒鼓鼓圆的小麦，有穗大、籽粒饱满的稻谷，有金光闪闪长一尺多、重一斤的玉米，有……。这些来自祖国各地的展品共同地反映了：1958年我国的粮食作物，都获得了史无前例的大丰收。
    高速度飞跃
    在这个室的进口处，我被金黄色的粮囤吸引住了。在这个囤的中央有闪烁着光辉灿烂的、不平常的红箭头和数目字：1958年全国粮食总产量达到七千五百亿斤左右，这比1957年增产一倍还多一点，比1949年增产近两倍半。1958年一年全国增产的粮食等于第一个五年计划期间历年递增数字总和（六百一十二亿斤）的六倍多。1958年粮食平均亩产四百一十斤左右，比1957年增长一倍还多一点。人们在这个室里走一遍，就可以看到我国的农业大跃进后浪推前浪，一浪高过一浪地向前发展的形势。
    一马当先跃进的小麦，获得了空前的大丰收。1958年全国播种四亿亩小麦，总产量达到了八百亿斤，平均亩产高达二百斤。小麦总产量比1957年增长69％，这一年增长的数字比1949年到1957年八年共增产的数字还多得多。小麦平均亩产量，1958年比1957年增长75％。由于小麦高速度的跃进，大面积丰收，不仅改变了小麦历来被人认为是“低产作物”的看法，而且小麦总产量超过了号称“小麦王国”的美国，跃居世界第二位。
    水稻在“早稻超小麦”、“晚稻超早稻”的豪迈的口号鼓舞下，展翅高飞，总产量在世界上继续领先。1958年全国播种四亿八千万亩水稻，总产量达到三千亿斤左右，平均亩产高达六百二十斤。一年的总产量相当于1957年全国粮食总产量的80％。水稻的总产量和平均亩产量跃进的速度是很高的。1958年水稻总产量比1957年增长73％，比1949年增长208％。这一年全国出现了几个水稻千斤以上的省。
    丰富多彩的杂粮作物在“以夏促秋”的口号下，也来了一个飞跃。1958年全国玉米总产量达到了九百亿斤左右，这比1957年猛跳一倍多。全国谷子总产量达到三百亿斤左右，这比1957年增产75％。全国高粱的总产量达到一百八十亿斤左右，比1957年增产18％，平均亩产比1957年增产95％。薯类作物1958年的总产量比1957年增长334％，平均亩产量比1957年增长172％。
    人们看了这些飞速增长的数字，不能不为我国粮食高速度的发展而骄傲，就不能不想到：全国有多少基层干部和领导人员为它熬过不眠之夜，有多少农民为它流过汗水、费过心机，有多少工人为它出过力，有多少商业工作者为它服务过……。由于他们的忘我劳动，我们提前九年基本实现了农业发展纲要所规定的粮食增产指标。
    大面积高产
    红旗处处飘
    人们在这个室里，不仅看到粮食作物全面丰产，而且还可以看到麦子、稻子、玉米、谷子、高粱和薯类各项作物，都出现了大面积的高产红旗。这些高产红旗插遍了全国各地，红旗处处飘扬。按耕地面积计算的粮食亩产量，全国有四分之三的县（市、旗）达到或者超过了全国农业发展纲要规定在十二年内达到的亩产“四、五、八”指标。在1957年全国才有六十多个县市实现“四、五、八”指标。
    “低产作物”翻了身，小麦红旗迎风招展。河西走廊的甘肃省张掖专区的敦煌县处在戈壁滩上，全县六万六千亩春小麦，平均亩产达到一千零三十七斤。河南省孟县广大的群众在党的领导下，发挥革命干劲，猛攻“旱、霜、虫、雨”四关，使全县二万五千八百亩冬小麦，从1957年平均亩产一百七十二斤，一跃获得平均亩产五百斤的大丰收。河北省安国县由于实行种麦园田化，深耕细作，使全县十八万多亩冬小麦平均亩产获得四百九十一斤。棉麦两熟区的湖北谷城县，全县二十五万四千亩冬小麦，平均亩产六百二十一斤。
    水稻插上千斤红旗的省有湖北、河南、广东、江苏、安徽等省。许多稻区和边远的高寒山区也插上了水稻大面积的红旗。
    山西省播种的七百零四万多亩玉米，平均亩产八百一十斤，这比历史上玉米亩产最高的1954年增产两倍多。山东省寿张县十二万亩玉米获得大面积丰产，亩产量比1957年增加十倍。河南省长葛县，新疆维吾尔自治区的巴楚县都分别成为玉米二千斤和一千斤的红旗县。山东省范县春谷子十六万四千多亩，比1957年增产十倍以上。长城脚下的河北抚宁县种的十万七千多亩多穗高粱，平均亩产一千三百多斤。湖南省郴县专区四十多万亩甘薯，平均亩产一万六千多斤。山西省雁北专区一百多万亩马铃薯，由于推广高产品种，特别是后期围歼了晚疫病害，获得平均每亩二千一百多斤的高产。陕西榆林专区1958年粮食总产量达到了十三亿一千九百多万斤，比1957年增产两倍多。
    巨大的意义
    粮食作物全面大跃进、全面大丰收，具有重大的经济意义，深远的政治影响和科学理论价值。1958年，每人平均占有的粮食达到了一千二百斤左右，全国农村有许多人民公社，已实行了“吃饭不要钱”。在一个人口占世界四分之一的大国里，在短短的时间之内，每人占有的粮食增长的这样快，这是一件了不起的大事呀！这充分驳倒了我国农业生产不能迅速增长的一切谬论，一切观潮派、秋后算账派也都彻底失败了。在十年前，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾在“白皮书”中断言：中国解决经济问题是毫无出路的，人口太多，是一种“不堪重负的压力”，
  “解决人民的吃饭问题”是“没有一个政府成功的”。现在铁的事实证明，这种论调也彻底破产了。这一事实，再一次雄辩地证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度有伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。
    人们在这里参观会清楚地了解到农业的大跃进、大丰收，为我国农业生产找到了一条高速度的发展道路，这就是大面积高额丰产田风起云涌的出现，说明我国农业生产有无穷无尽的潜力，我们完全有根据在开展大面积高额丰产田运动的基础上，实行深耕细作，少种多收。随着粮食问题的解决，将逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟业、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中所占的比重，并且加速林业、牧畜业、副业和渔业的发展。这就为在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌提供了条件。
    粮食作物的大跃进、大丰收，已经推动了并且还将更迅速地推动着我国整个经济、文化建设事业的迅速发展。农业是工业原料和资金的重要来源，农村是工业品的广阔市场。农业生产的大跃进，不仅给工业以刺激和推动，使工业加快发展速度，以满足农业大跃进的需要，而且也创造了广大农民办工业的条件。在全民大办钢铁工业中，农民不是抽出一支强大的生力军，转到工业战线上来了吗，各地出现的几十万座“小土群”高炉，就是主要依靠农民的力量办起来的。提前超额完成一千零七十万吨钢，就有农民劳动的一份成果在里边。农业的大丰收还为文化革命和技术革命提供了雄厚的物质条件，因此，波澜壮阔的文化建设高潮在农村出现了。
    农业大跃进还促进了农业科学理论的发展，并给新的农业科学的发展开拓了广阔的道路。农业“八字宪法”：水、肥、土、种、密、保（植物保护）、工（工具改革）、管（田间管理），就是理论与实践相结合的结晶。
    人们在这里参观了粮食各项作物，一致认为获得了破天荒的、惊人的奇迹。但是，人们认为粮食增产的潜力仍然很大；每人占有的粮食还没有达到中央提出的二千斤到三千斤的要求；薯类作物在粮食总产量中的比重大，要压缩薯类的比重，增加细粮的比重。这就向全国五亿农民提出了艰巨的任务。五亿农民在苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，在实行公社化后的第一个生产年，都满怀信心地迎接党的八届六中全会向全国人民提出的新的战斗任务，1959年粮食总产量要达到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花总产量要达到一亿担（皮棉）左右，更好地和全面地向前跃进再跃进，正争取创造出更大的奇迹来！（附图片）
