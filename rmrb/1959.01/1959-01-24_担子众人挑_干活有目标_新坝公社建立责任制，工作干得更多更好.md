Everyone Carries the Load, Work Has Goals
Xinba Commune Establishes Responsibility System, More and Better Work is Done

(Our report) The Xinba People's Commune in Yangzhou County, Jiangsu Province, has comprehensively established a responsibility system from production to life. The superiority of the commune has been further brought into play, and a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward has begun to appear.

After Xinba Commune implemented line-based leadership and division of labor in the workforce, it immediately established various responsibility systems. In terms of collective responsibility, the production team is divided into responsibility areas for field management, with fixed output and fixed measures, and each labor force is assigned to manage the fields. In terms of individual responsibility, a labor quota is posted. For example, the weeding team sets a quota of 0.8 fen of land per day for Class A labor, with Class B, C, and D laborers each reducing the quota by 0.1 fen, with unified quality requirements. While establishing the responsibility system, an acceptance system was also established. An acceptance team consisting of three to five people, including the professional team leader, experienced farmers, and commune members (all directly participating in the work), conducts acceptance every three days, evaluation every ten days, and summarizes each agricultural task upon completion. Rewards are given for those who meet the quality standards during acceptance and evaluation. Those who do not meet the quality standards are subject to criticism and self-criticism and must rework.

After the comprehensive establishment of the labor quota posting responsibility system, the entire Xinba Commune is almost like a comprehensive factory, with production and life in good order. The entire commune has a unified timetable. In winter, labor is performed for ten hours a day, sleep for eight hours, and the rest of the time is for eating, learning, and resting. The plans for various agricultural tasks and the specific labor arrangements for each day are written on the "labor quota posting" in the canteen. In this way, commune members can prepare their tools the day before for the next day's labor, making it easy to go to work on time the next day. In terms of labor arrangement, various specialized teams for specific labor have been established on the four fronts of water conservancy, field management, industry, sideline production, and living welfare, based on the needs of the task and the principle of everyone doing their best, just like the various workshops in a factory. According to the physical strength, production experience, and technical level of each commune member, the labor capacity of the commune members is divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, and corresponding labor quotas are set according to the labor grade.

Since the implementation of the labor quota posting responsibility system in Xinba Commune more than a month ago, all aspects of work have been done excellently. Judging from the many acceptance results of the acceptance team, all kinds of agricultural work meet the quality standards, ensuring that the production plans formulated by the commune and production brigade are completed on time and with quality. Last year, the first weeding of wheat fields and green manure fields was still in progress in January; at present, all production brigades have begun weeding for the third time. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, a "collection, planting, creation, application, and transportation" five-pronged approach has been implemented, and the fertilizer for more than 12,000 mu of wheat fields in the entire commune can be regularly supplied according to plan. The work of protecting cattle through the winter is also done very well, with each head reaching 80% fatness. Significant achievements have also been made in canteens, kindergartens, and other living welfare and other aspects.

The establishment of the labor quota posting responsibility system has greatly strengthened the production responsibility of commune members, and the enthusiasm and expertise for labor have been further brought into play. They say, "Everyone carries the heavy load, and everyone has a goal in their work." Everyone has a great drive for their professional labor. For example, the pig-raising team has widely adopted the "three-cut" fattening method, which has increased the average monthly meat gain of live pigs from about 20 jin before the establishment of the responsibility system to more than 28 jin. According to the responsible comrades of the commune, it used to take six or seven months for a pig to grow from small to fat. According to the current speed, it only takes more than five months.

### 担子众人挑　干活有目标  新坝公社建立责任制，工作干得更多更好

    担子众人挑　干活有目标
    新坝公社建立责任制，工作干得更多更好
    本报讯　江苏扬中县新坝人民公社，从生产到生活，全面建立了责任制，公社优越性得到进一步发挥，开始出现了更大、更好、更全面跃进景象。
    新坝公社在劳动力分线领导、分军作战之后，紧接着建立了各项责任制。在集体责任制方面，如在田间管理上，以生产队划为责任区，定产量、定措施，将每个劳动力分工管到田。在个人责任制方面，实行劳动定额挂牌。如锄草专业队，甲等劳力每天定额锄田八分，乙、丙、丁等依次各减一分，质量要求是统一的。在建立责任制的同时，建立了验收制度。由专业队长、老农和社员（都是直接参加劳动的）三、五人组成验收小组，三天一次验收，十天一次评比，每项农活结束时小结一次。验收评比时对符合质量标准的给以奖励，不符合质量标准的，开展批评与自我批评，并一律返工。
    全面建立了劳动定额挂牌责任制之后，整个新坝公社差不多像一座综合性的大工厂，生产、生活各方面都井井有条。全公社有一个统一的作息时间表，冬季每天劳动十小时，睡眠八小时，其余是吃饭、学习和休息的时间。各种农活的计划和每天具体劳动的安排，都写在食堂里的“劳动定额挂牌”上。这样，社员们就可以在前一天为第二天劳动准备好工具，便于第二天准时上工。在劳动力安排上，根据任务需要和各尽所能的原则，在水利、田间管理、工业、副业和生活福利等四条战线上，又建立了各种具体劳动的专业队，好像工厂里的各个车间一样。根据各个社员的身体强弱、生产经验与技术水平高低，把社员的劳动能力分为甲、乙、丙、丁四等，按劳动力的等级订出相应的劳动定额。
    新坝公社实行劳动定额挂牌责任制一个多月以来，各方面的工作都做得很出色。从验收组许多次验收情况来看，各种农活都符合质量标准，保证了公社和生产大队制订的生产计划按时、按质完成。去年，麦田和绿肥田的第一遍锄草工作，到1月份还在进行；而目前，各个生产大队都已开始锄第三遍草了。在积肥方面，实行了“积、种、造、施、运”五管齐下的办法，全公社一万二千多亩麦田的肥料，都能按计划经常供给。保护耕牛过冬的工作也做得很好，头头都达到了八成膘。在食堂、幼儿园等生活福利和其他方面，也都有显著的成绩。
    劳动定额挂牌责任制的建立，使社员生产责任心大大加强，劳动积极性和特长得到进一步发挥。他们说是“千斤担子大家挑，人人干活有目标”。大家对本专业劳动的钻劲很大。如养猪专业队，普遍采用了“三割”催肥法，使生猪从建立责任制以前每月平均长肉二十斤左右，提高到二十八斤多。据公社负责同志说，一头猪从小到肥，过去要六、七个月，按现在这个速度计算，只要五个多月就行了。
