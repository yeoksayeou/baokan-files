    Where do Sunspots Come From?
    Shi Zhongxian
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper reported on page 6 on January 15th the news that "Beijing astronomical workers observed a large sunspot group," some readers asked for answers to questions such as what are sunspots and how are they formed. We now have Comrade Shi Zhongxian of the Beijing Observatory Preparatory Office write this article.
    Recently, when the sun is not too bright, people can see a black spot as big as a jujube on the solar disk. What exactly is going on?
      Sunspots Appear Frequently
    This black spot is the large sunspot that has recently appeared on the sun. Astronomical staff at the Beijing Observatory Preparatory Office observed this largest sunspot group to appear on the sun's surface in nearly ten years. It is located between 12 and 13 degrees north latitude on the solar disk and has an area approximately nineteen times that of the Earth.
    Sunspots appear frequently. However, because the sun is very far away from us (149.5 million kilometers), the sun is larger than the Earth (it would take 75,000 Earths to completely cover the solar disk facing us), and the sunlight is very dazzling, even if there are sunspots as large as the Earth (sunspots of this size are common), we cannot see them with the naked eye; only when sunspots several tens of times larger than the Earth appear near the center of the sun, when the sun is just rising or about to set, or when heavy fog and clouds cover the solar disk but we can still see the solar disk clearly, can we see it with the naked eye.
    The first people in the world to discover sunspots were the Chinese. The "Book of Han, Treatise on the Five Elements" records: In the first year of Yongguang during the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty (43 BC), in April... the sun was black in the west, as big as a pellet. It also records: In the Han "first year of Heping (28 BC)... in the 3rd month, on the day of Yiwu, the sun rose yellow, with black gas, as big as a coin, in the center of the sun." Even earlier, the "Huainanzi" and "Spring and Autumn Yuanmingbao" contain records of sunspots. (The "Huainanzi" records: "There is a crow squatting in the sun." The "Spring and Autumn Yuanmingbao" records: "There is a three-legged crow in the sun." The "squatting crow" and "three-legged crow" mentioned here refer to sunspots.) The earliest Japanese record is in 651 AD, and the earliest Western record is in 807 AD. The latter is eight hundred and thirty-five years later than the world's recognized Chinese record (sunspots seen in 28 BC).
    Sunspots are Not Black
    In fact, sunspots are not black, but because they are relatively low in temperature compared to the sun's surface (about 4,500 degrees Celsius, while the sun's surface temperature is 6,000 degrees Celsius) and have a relatively large concavity
  (concave by about 100 kilometers), they appear relatively black. If the sun's surface were covered with sunspots, we would not feel anything; the sun would still be very dazzling and bright.
    A fully developed sunspot has a darker core (umbra) and a brighter edge (penumbra). The penumbra has a finer structure, sometimes radiating like rays in all directions, and sometimes forming a vortex or other irregular curve.
    Sunspot groups are always more common than individual sunspots, and they often begin with small black dots surrounded by faculae (i.e., cloud-like gas masses in the upper atmosphere, clearly visible at the edges of ordinary sunspot photographs, towering above the sun's surface and brighter than the sun's surface), which then develop into two large sunspots. There are many small sunspots between them. The leading sunspot (because the sun rotates from west to east, sunspots always emerge from the eastern edge and descend from the western edge, so the sunspot running in front is on the west side) moves faster, and the sunspot group elongates in the east-west direction as time increases. The following (eastern) sunspot splits quickly and then tends to disappear. The leading sunspot changes very slowly and can exist for a long time. However, not all sunspots develop through such stages. Most sunspots disappear in less than a day. However, long-lived sunspots can exist for several months or even a year; for example, a sunspot group existed for eighteen months between 1840 and 1841.
    Sunspot Cycle is Eleven Years
    The number of sunspots is constantly changing, sometimes many (such as in 1958) and sometimes few (such as in 1954). But, generally speaking, there is an eleven-year cycle of change. It takes about seven years from maximum to minimum and about four years from minimum to maximum.
    The vast majority of sunspots appear on either side of the solar equator, and sunspots rarely appear in areas with latitudes greater than 40 degrees. Within a sunspot cycle, the latitude of the sunspots is constantly changing. Sunspots in a new cycle always appear at higher latitudes, and later sunspots gradually approach the equator; before the sunspots of an old cycle have completely disappeared, sunspots of a new cycle will appear again in high-latitude regions. Interestingly, sunspots are often more numerous in the sun's southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, and more numerous in the eastern hemisphere than in the western hemisphere. The preceding sunspots are clearer than the following ones.
    About 60% of sunspot groups are bipolar groups, that is, the leading sunspot (in the direction of the sun's rotation) and the following sunspot have different magnetic properties. The magnetic properties of the sunspot belts in the northern and southern hemispheres are exactly opposite, that is: sunspots often appear in pairs, and some sunspots have a north pole magnetic property, while others have a south pole magnetic property. Moreover, in any pair of sunspots in one hemisphere of the sun, the leading sunspot always has the same kind of magnetic property (south pole), while in the other hemisphere of the sun, each leading sunspot always has the opposite magnetic property (north pole). This lasts for eleven years, and when sunspots begin a new cycle, the magnetic properties of sunspots in the northern and southern hemispheres are interchanged. It is not difficult to see that the sunspot magnetic field has a 22-year cycle of change. However, like the sunspot's own cycle of change, this cycle of change has not yet been satisfactorily explained.
    The Central Magnetic Field Strength of a Sunspot Core Can Reach Several Thousand Gauss
  (Gauss is the unit of magnetic field strength; the Earth's magnetic field strength is 0.6 Gauss). The magnetic field strength decreases rapidly outward from the center of the sunspot. Does the sun itself have a universal magnetic field like the Earth? Some people say it does and have measured it to be about 50 Gauss. Some people say it does not because they measured the result to be zero. Does it exist or not? Further measurements are needed. The Soviet cosmic rocket's exploration of the moon's magnetic field will help solve this problem.
    The Reasons for Sunspot Formation Remain to be Explored
    The sun's surface temperature is 6,000 degrees Celsius, while the sun's center is as high as 20 million degrees Celsius. At such high temperatures, everything melts and becomes a very hot gas. Because the internal temperature is much higher than the surface temperature, and the surface temperature is not all 6,000 degrees, this imbalance causes huge gas flow and vortex motion (mainly the motion of incandescent hydrogen). Gases inside the sun are rolled to the sun's surface like extremely powerful tornadoes on Earth. Rising gases expand and therefore cool down. If the gas is too cold, it will be much darker than the surrounding background. Thus, we see sunspots in the center of the vortex. Observations show that in the core of the sunspot, gaseous substances (gaseous substances of elements such as hydrogen, helium, calcium, iron, and sodium) are indeed ejected at a speed of 1-2 kilometers per second, and in the penumbra, the gas mainly radiates from the center to the edge. However, how sunspots are actually produced remains to be explored and studied.
    The Impact of Sunspots on Earth
    The number of sunspots on the sun has a great impact on the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. When there are few sunspots on the sun, the Earth's magnetic field is not disturbed; but when many sunspots appear on the sun, or a large sunspot group appears, the Earth's magnetic field will undergo drastic changes (magnetic storms). At this time, the large sunspot group radiates a large number of high-speed (more than 1,000 kilometers per second) charged particles (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons. These things collide with atmospheric molecules and ions in the Earth's upper atmosphere, changing the original properties of the atmosphere, which interrupts shortwave radio propagation, disables radio facsimile, and creates beautiful auroras in the Earth's polar regions. In addition, some high-voltage power lines have increased large extra currents due to magnetic storms, seriously damaging the power transmission system, causing cities to fall into darkness and factories to shut down, resulting in countless losses. In addition, changes in sunspots cause changes in the total energy of solar radiation (increased when there are more sunspots), which causes changes in ground temperature and rainfall. It can be seen that sunspots have a great relationship with our production and life. Regularly observing and studying them is a very meaningful task. Currently, there are many observatories and astronomical observation units across the country that regularly observe and study sunspots.

    太阳上何来黑子？
    史忠先
    编者按：　1月15日本报六版报道了“北京天文工作者观测到太阳上的大黑子群”的新闻以后，有读者提出什么叫太阳黑子、它是怎样形成的等问题要求解答。现请北京天文台筹备处史忠先同志写了这篇文章。
    近来，在太阳不太明亮的时候，人们可以看到太阳圆面上有一大如小枣的黑点。这究竟是怎么回事呢？
      太阳黑子经常出现
    这黑点就是最近出现在太阳上的大黑子。北京天文台筹备处的天文工作人员观测到这出现在太阳表面上近十年来最大的黑子群，它的位置在日面北纬十二度到十三度之间，面积约相当于地球的十九倍。
    太阳黑子是经常出现的。但是，由于太阳离我们很远（一万万四千九百五十万公里），太阳比地球大（要七万五千个地球才能把太阳朝着我们这一面的圆面完全遮住），太阳光十分耀眼，所以就是在太阳上有地球那么大的黑子（这样大的黑子是常见的），我们用肉眼也看不到；只有比地球大好几十倍的黑子出现在太阳中心附近，在太阳刚升起来或者将要下落的时候，或者当大雾和云层遮住太阳圆面而仍能看清太阳圆面的时候，我们才能用肉眼看见它。
    全世界最先发现太阳上有黑子的是我们中国人。“汉书五行志”载：汉元帝永光元年（公元前43年）4月……日黑居仄，大如弹丸。又载：汉“河平元年（公元前28年……）3月乙未，日出黄，有黑气，大如钱，居日中”。更早在“淮南子”和“春秋元命苞”中就有黑子的记载。（“淮南子”载：“日中有蹲乌。”“春秋元命苞”载：“日中有三足乌。”这里说的“蹲乌”和“三足乌”即指太阳黑子。）而日本最早的记载是在公元651年，西洋最早的记载是在公元807年。后者比世界公认的我国记载（公元前28年所见黑子）迟了八百三十五年。黑子并不是黑的
    其实，黑子并不是黑的，只是因为它和太阳表面比较，温度比较低（约摄氏四千五百度，太阳表面温度为摄氏六千度），凹度又比较大
  （凹进一百公里左右），所以它才显得比较黑。如果太阳表面布满黑子，我们也不会有什么感觉，太阳仍然是十分耀眼和明亮的。
    一个发展完全的黑子，有较暗的核（本影）和较亮的边缘（半影）。半影有较精细的结构，有时它像射线一样向四面发射，有时则成旋涡状或其他不规则的曲线。
    成群出现的黑子总比个别出现的黑子多，而且往往开始于光斑（即大气上层的云状气体块，在普通的太阳黑子照片边缘看得很清楚，它高耸在太阳表面上，比太阳表面更亮）围绕着的小黑点，继而发展成两个大黑子。在它们之间有很多小黑子，前导的（由于太阳自西向东转，所以黑子总是从东边缘出来由西边缘下去，跑在前面的黑子就在西边）黑子移动较快，黑子群随着时间的增长而在东西方向拉长，后随的（东边的）黑子很快就分裂，然后趋于消失。前导黑子变化很慢，能存在很久。但是并不是所有黑子的发展都历经这样的阶段。大多数黑子的寿命不到一天就消失了。不过，寿命长的黑子也能存在几个月甚至一年之久；如1840到1841年间，有一个黑子群就存在了十八个月。
    黑子变化周期是十一年
    黑子的数目经常在变化着，有时多（如1958年就很多），有时少（如1954年就很少）。但是，总的说来，有一个十一年的变化周期。由极大到极小，约历七年；由极小到极大，约历四年。
    极大多数的黑子出现在太阳赤道两旁，纬度大于四十度的地区，很少有黑子出现。在黑子周内，黑子的纬度在不断变化。新的一周的黑子总是在较高的纬度出现，以后出现的黑子逐渐地接近赤道；旧的一周的黑子还没有完全消失，新的一周的黑子就又会在高纬度的地区出现了。有趣的是，太阳的南半球的黑子往往比北半球多，东半球的黑子又比西半球多，先行的黑子比后随的清楚。
    60％左右的黑子群是偶极群，也就是说，先行的黑子（顺太阳的自转方向）和后随的黑子带有不同的磁性。南北半球的黑子带的磁性恰好相反，即：太阳黑子往往成对出现，而一些黑子的磁性是北极，另一些则是南极。而且，在太阳的一个半球的任何一对黑子中，先行的黑子永远具有同一种磁性（南极），在太阳的另一半球，每一先行的黑子总具有相反一种磁性（北极）。这样持续了十一年，当太阳黑子开始新的循环时，北半球和南半球的黑子的磁性就相互易位。由此不难发现，黑子磁场有一个二十二年的变化周期。不过，这个变化周期和黑子本身变化周期一样，至今还没得到满意的解释。
    黑子核的中心磁场强度能达几千高斯
  （高斯是磁场强度单位，地球的磁场强度为零点六个高斯）。由黑子中心向外，磁场强度迅速下降。太阳本身是不是和地球一样有一个普遍磁场呢？有人说有，并测出来为五十高斯左右。有人说没有，因为他测得的结果是零。究竟有没有呢？还有待继续测量。苏联宇宙火箭对月球磁场的探测，将有助于这个问题的解决。黑子产生的原因还待探索
    太阳表面温度有摄氏六千度，而太阳中心高达两千万度。在这样高的温度下，所有的东西都熔化了，成了非常热的气体。由于内部温度比表面温度高得多，而表面的温度也不全都是六千度，这种不平衡就引起了巨大的气体流动和旋涡运动（主要是炽热氢的运动）。太阳内部的气体像地球上刮的威力极大的龙卷风一样卷到太阳表面，上升的气体膨胀因而冷却。如果气体太冷了，那末它比起四周的背景，就会暗得多。于是，我们就在旋涡的中心看到了太阳黑子。由观测表明：在黑子的核中确有每秒1—2公里速度的气体物质（氢、氦、钙、铁和钠等元素的气体物质）喷出来，在半影中气体主要是从中心向边缘散发。不过，黑子究竟是怎样产生的，还有待继续探索和研究。黑子对地球的影响
    太阳上黑子的多少对地球大气和地球磁场有着很大的影响。当太阳上没有什么黑子的时候，地球磁场不受扰动；而当太阳上出现很多黑子，或者出现一个很大的黑子群的时候，地球磁场就会发生剧烈的变化（磁暴）。这时，大黑子群辐射出了大量的、高速的（每秒一千多公里）带电粒子（氢原子核）和电子，这些东西和地球上层的大气分子、离子相撞，就改变了大气层原有的性质，从而使得短波无线电传播中断，无线电传真失灵，以及在地球两极地区出现美丽的极光。并且，有些高压电线因磁暴而增加了很大的额外电流，严重地破坏了输电系统，使城市陷于黑暗，工厂陷于停工，从而带来了无数的损失。此外，太阳黑子的变化使太阳辐射的总能量产生变化（黑子多时增强）了，因而引起了地面温度和降雨量的变化。由此可见，太阳黑子对我们的生产和生活都有着很大的关系。经常的观测和研究它，就成了一件非常有意义的工作。现在，全国有很多天文台和天文观测单位对太阳黑子进行经常性的观测和研究。
