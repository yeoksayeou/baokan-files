Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: Our correspondent reports: The economic construction of Eastern European socialist countries in 1958 presented a delightful scene of flourishing development. Triumphant news of completing and overfulfilling the 1958 industrial production plan kept pouring in. Some countries achieved bumper harvests in agricultural production. In the context of the great cooperation among socialist countries, they achieved outstanding results in developing industrial sectors with the most favorable natural and economic conditions in their own countries.

In 1958, the industrial production growth rate of Eastern European socialist countries generally exceeded the average rate of their ongoing five-year or three-year plans. Compared with 1957, these countries experienced rapid development in industrial production, with Albania showing the fastest growth in industrial output value, increasing by 20% compared to 1957. 1958 was the year in which the German Democratic Republic achieved its greatest success on the industrial production front in the nine years since its founding. Preliminary calculations indicate that its industrial output increased by 10.7% compared to 1957. Hungarian industry suffered serious damage during the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion, but after recovering in 1957, it advanced again in 1958 with a growth rate of 13%. Czechoslovakia's industrial production growth rate in 1958 reached its highest level in the past six years. Romania's total industrial output in 1958 will be approximately three times greater than the highest pre-liberation production level in 1938.

In 1958, economic mutual assistance and cooperation among the socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, further developed. According to the principle of international division of labor among socialist countries, Eastern European brotherly countries vigorously developed certain industrial sectors that they were most conditioned to develop. Therefore, in 1958, the production of these industries shone brightly, with outstanding achievements. Poland's coal production in 1958 reached its peak in Polish history, with an extraction volume of 94.8 million tons, exceeding the plan by more than 1.5 million tons; the labor productivity of coal miners reached the highest level since 1950. Hungary's communications equipment and instrument manufacturing industry, which has a technical foundation and export traditions, also achieved remarkable results in 1958, with the output of precision instruments increasing by more than 20% compared to 1957, and export value increasing by more than one-third compared to 1957. Czechoslovakia's machinery manufacturing industry is of great importance to the country's industrial and agricultural production and foreign trade. Its heavy machinery manufacturing industry produced 750 million crowns more than originally planned, and the output of trucks and sedans increased by 13% and 27% respectively compared to 1957. Romania's chemical and steel industry production grew the fastest in 1958, estimated to reach 19%. The focus of its industrial development in 1958 was the electricity and petroleum industries. In 1958, Romania's oil production was 2.5 times that of 1938. In addition, Bulgaria's non-ferrous metal industry and Albania's mining industry also developed rapidly. By the end of 1958, Albania's copper mines had increased by 37%, and oil had increased by 11%.

In the peaceful competition with capitalist countries, certain industries in Eastern European socialist countries have made considerable progress. In terms of per capita output, Czechoslovakia has ten products that rank first and second in the world, respectively. The per capita steel output has exceeded that of France and Sweden, and is close to the level of the United Kingdom. The German Democratic Republic's chemical industry output per capita has jumped to second place in the world, and its power generation exceeds that of all Western European countries, including West Germany. Fourteen years after the establishment of the people's regime in Poland, the per capita output of basic products has been higher than the world average.

In 1958, the achievements of Eastern European socialist countries in agricultural production were also considerable. The German Democratic Republic achieved a bumper harvest of crops, and the output of most agricultural products per capita has exceeded that of West Germany. Although agriculture in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and other countries suffered from natural disasters, the output was no lower than in 1957. Hungary had an unprecedented bumper harvest of grapes, and milk production was better than in any previous year. Czechoslovakia's sugar beets and hops and Poland's fruits also had bumper harvests.

The great achievements of agricultural development in Eastern European brotherly countries in 1958 are also reflected in the vigorous development of agricultural collectivization and technological reform.

Bulgaria had almost completely realized agricultural collectivization long ago. In 1958, it launched a mass movement to merge agricultural cooperatives, bringing agricultural collectivization to a higher stage of development. The number of farmers joining agricultural cooperatives in Albania increased by about 50% compared to 1957, and collectivization in the plains area is nearing completion. From January to November 1958, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic also increased by about half. In terms of agricultural technological reform, the main measures taken by Eastern European socialist countries were: developing agricultural mechanization, building water conservancy projects, and improving soil. In 1958, Romania and Bulgaria achieved outstanding achievements in mass water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and deep plowing. The reason why Eastern European brotherly countries achieved these achievements in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 is mainly because the Communist and Workers' Parties of the brotherly countries strengthened their leadership over economic work. In 1958, the parties and governments of the brotherly countries successively adopted a series of major measures to improve economic management and mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses.

The great achievements of Eastern European socialist countries on the economic front in 1958 are interwoven into a magnificent picture, showing the great vitality and unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. (Picture attached)

    经济战线捷报频传　建设成就光辉绚丽
    东欧兄弟国家跃进一年获硕果
    新华社31日讯　本社记者报道：东欧社会主义国家1958年的经济建设呈现一片繁花盛开的可喜景象。提前和超额完成1958年工业生产计划的捷报不断传来。一些国家的农业生产获得了大丰收。它们在社会主义国家大协作的情况下，在发展本国具有最有利的自然和经济条件的工业部门方面取得了出色成绩。
    1958年，东欧社会主义国家工业生产增长速度普遍都超过它们正在执行的五年计划或三年计划的平均速度。和1957年相比，这些国家的工业生产都有了较快的发展，工业产值增长得最快的是阿尔巴尼亚，比1957年增长了20％。1958年是民主德国建国九年来在工业生产战线上取得最大成就的一年。它的工业产量据初步计算，比1957年增长10.7％。匈牙利工业在1956年反革命叛乱时曾经受到严重的破坏，但是，经过1957年的恢复以后，1958年又以13％的增长速度前进了。捷克斯洛伐克1958年工业生产增长速度达到了以往六年来最高的水平。罗马尼亚1958年工业总产量将比解放前生产水平最高的1938年约增多三倍。
    1958年，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的经济互助合作有了进一步的发展。东欧各兄弟国家按照社会主义国家国际分工的原则，大力发展了本国最有条件发展的某些工业部门。因此，1958年这些工业的生产大放异彩，成绩非常出色。波兰1958年的煤产量达到波兰历史上的高峰，开采量达九千四百八十万吨，超过计划一百五十多万吨；采煤工人的劳动生产率达到1950年以来最高的水平。有技术基础和出口传统的匈牙利通讯器材和仪器制造业，1958年的成绩也十分显著，精密仪器产量比1957年增加20％以上，出口额比1957年增加三分之一以上。捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造业对本国工农业生产和对外贸易都具有十分重要的意义，它的重型机器制造工业比原计划增产七亿五千万克朗，卡车和轿车的产量分别比1957年增加13％和27％。罗马尼亚的化学和钢铁工业生产1958年增长得最快，估计可达19％。1958年它的工业发展的重点是电力和石油工业，1958年，罗马尼亚石油产量为1938年的二点五倍。此外，保加利亚的有色金属工业和阿尔巴尼亚的采矿业也发展得很快，到1958年年底，阿尔巴尼亚的铜矿增加了37％，石油增加了11％。
    在和资本主义国家的和平竞赛中，东欧社会主义国家的某些工业取得了长足的发展。捷克斯洛伐克在按人口计算产量方面，有十项产品已分别居世界第一位和第二位，按人口计算的钢产量已超过法国和瑞典，而接近于英国的水平。民主德国的化学工业产量按人口平均计算已跃居世界第二位，发电量超过了包括西德在内的所有西欧国家。波兰在人民政权建立十四年以后，按人口计算的基本产品产量已高于世界产量的平均水平。
    1958年，东欧社会主义国家在农业生产方面的成就也是相当大的。民主德国的农作物获得了大丰收，大部分农业品在按人口平均计算的产量方面已超过西德。捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰等国的农业虽然遭到自然灾害，但是产量并不低于1957年。匈牙利葡萄空前大丰收，牛奶生产比以往任何一年都好。捷克斯洛伐克的甜菜和啤酒花和波兰的水果也获得丰收。
    1958年东欧各兄弟国家农业发展的巨大成就还表现在农业合作化的蓬勃发展和技术改革方面。
    保加利亚早就差不多完全实现了农业合作化，1958年又开展了一个合并农业合作社的群众性运动，使农业合作化进入了更高的发展阶段。阿尔巴尼亚加入农业合作社的农户比1957年约增加了50％，平原地区的合作化将近完成。从1958年1月到11月，民主德国的农业合作社的数量也增加了大约一半。在农业技术改革方面，东欧社会主义国家采取的主要措施是：发展农业机械化、兴修水利、改良土壤等。1958年，罗马尼亚、保加利亚在搞群众性的兴修水利、积肥深耕等方面获得了出色的成就。1958年东欧各个兄弟国家之所以在工农业生产方面取得这些成就，主要是由于各兄弟国家的共产党和工人党加强了对经济工作的领导。1958年，各兄弟国家的党和政府相继采取了一系列重大的措施来改进经济的管理工作，发动群众的主动性和积极性。
    东欧各个社会主义国家1958年在经济战线上所获得的巨大成就，交织成一幅绚丽的图画，显示出社会主义制度的伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。（附图片）
