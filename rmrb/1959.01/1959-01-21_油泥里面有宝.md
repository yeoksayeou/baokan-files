　　The nutritional value of eggs is great, mainly because they contain phospholipids and proteins. Phospholipids help the digestive system absorb nutrients, especially enhancing the liver and large intestine's digestion of fat. Medicinally, they can treat liver diseases and promote children's physical development. According to experiments by Soviet scientists, white rabbits fed with feed mixed with phospholipids gained two-thirds more weight than those fed with ordinary feed.

　　In fact, phospholipids are not only found in eggs, but also in various vegetable oilseeds. Generally, vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and rapeseed oil contain about 5% phospholipids, while soybean oil and sunflower seed oil also contain more than 1%. These phospholipids are useless when left in the oil. They also darken the oil color, and when heated excessively during cooking, they produce black smoke, foam, and a bitter taste. Therefore, in order to improve oil quality, general oil extraction plants remove some of the oil sludge (phospholipids and other impurities) through refining. In the past, this oil sludge would ferment over time in the oil plant and be treated as waste.

　　Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Oil and Fat Chemical Industry Company, combining various oil refining processes, has preliminarily succeeded in extracting and refining phospholipids from oil sludge using a vacuum drying and dehydration method.

　　Using this phospholipid to replace eggs in making pastries, biscuits, bread, pasta, etc., not only tastes good but also has high nutritional value. In addition, this phospholipid can also be used as an emulsifier in the manufacture of cosmetics, soaps, rubber, leather, petroleum products, and other industries.

    油泥里面有宝
    蛋品的营养价值大，主要因为它含有磷脂和蛋白质。磷脂能帮助消化系统吸收养分，特别能增强肝脏和大肠对脂肪的消化，在医学上能治疗肝脏病，能促进儿童身体发育。根据苏联科学工作者的试验，用掺磷脂的饲料喂养小白兔比用一般饲料喂的体重增加三分之二。
  其实，磷脂不仅在蛋品中有，各种植物油料中都有。一般植物油，如花生油、棉子油、菜子油大约含5％的磷脂，豆油和葵花子油含量也在1％以上。这些磷脂留在油品中是没有用处的，它还会使油色深暗，食用时过热就冒黑烟、起泡沫、有苦味。所以一般榨油厂为了提高油品质量，就通过精炼清除一部分油泥（磷脂和其他杂质），过去这种油泥在油厂中日久发酵就当废料处理了。
    最近天津市油脂化学工业公司，结合各个精炼油脂的过程，初步用真空干燥脱水的办法，从油泥中提炼精制磷脂成功。
    用这种磷脂代替蛋品制糕点、饼干、面包、通心粉等，不仅味好而且营养价值也很高。此外，这种磷脂还可作乳化剂，在制造化妆品、肥皂、橡胶、皮革、石油产品等工业中也能应用。
