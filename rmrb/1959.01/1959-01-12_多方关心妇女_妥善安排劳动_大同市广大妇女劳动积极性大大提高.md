According to the Shanxi Daily, Datong City, based on women's characteristics of patience and meticulousness and their special physiological conditions, took care of women's special interests in many ways from the social division of labor and daily labor system, greatly stimulating women's enthusiasm for labor and enabling them to play a huge role on all fronts.

During the all-round Great Leap Forward, more than 59,000 women in Datong City were liberated from housework. In order to give full play to the role of this new force, the Datong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China studied and determined that women should be assigned to work suitable for them according to their characteristics of patience and meticulousness and their special physiological conditions, and their special interests should be taken care of. According to this policy, the personnel and labor departments adopted the method of "replacing men with women," transferring more than 40,000 young and strong male laborers from commerce, service industries, post and telecommunications, light industry, and all work positions that women could handle, and supplementing these places with more than 50,000 women. They served as salespersons, service personnel, barbers, postal workers, telephone operators, custodians, librarians, statisticians, cooks, seamstresses, broadcasters, nursery workers, and nurses. Some also took on lighter work such as machinery, repair, wool spinning, cotton spinning, weaving, dyeing, washing, dismantling, painting, installation, coal selection, and various processing tasks. Datong Coal Mine and Datong Cement Plant also conducted a general physical examination of female employees and readjusted their work according to their physical strength and age. Their special interests were also appropriately taken care of in their lives. The Datong Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee specially issued instructions stipulating that women could take appropriate rest during menstruation, not do heavy work, and not go into cold water; women who were more than three months pregnant should be transferred to lighter work; during childbirth, in addition to ensuring the implementation of the 56-day maternity leave, an appropriate amount of refined grains and sesame oil should be given in the diet according to local conditions; during the breastfeeding period, they should be given a certain amount of breastfeeding time according to the distance of their residences. In addition to running nurseries and breastfeeding rooms, Datong Power Plant also had special pregnancy meals for pregnant women. The Taiyang People's Commune stipulated that women should implement a card-flipping system during menstruation; those who were more than three months pregnant should not do heavier work; during childbirth, they should rest for two months and be given an extra portion of white flour and millet to take home to eat. For mothers who are breastfeeding, they are guaranteed to have a breastfeeding time once every morning and afternoon.

After the broad masses of women were taken care of in labor and living systems, their enthusiasm for labor was greatly stimulated. The 745 women assigned to the commercial sector as salespersons were universally praised by the masses for their kind attitude, fearlessness of trouble, and enthusiastic reception of customers. There are 337 factories of all sizes in the city, all or mostly organized by women, such as children's shoes, washing and dyeing, processing, wool spinning, painting, and embroidery. The 4,437 women working in these factories have quickly mastered the technology. (Attached photo)

    多方关心妇女　妥善安排劳动
    大同市广大妇女劳动积极性大大提高
    据山西日报消息　大同市根据妇女具有耐心细致的特点和生理上的特殊情况，从社会劳动分工和日常劳动制度上多方面照顾妇女的特殊利益，大大地激发了妇女的劳动积极性，使她们在各个战线上发挥了巨大作用。
    在全面大跃进中，大同市五万九千多名妇女从家务劳动中解放出来。为了充分发挥这批生力军的作用，中共大同市委研究确定，要根据妇女耐心细致的特点和生理上的特殊情况分配给适合她们做的工作，并照顾她们的特殊利益。人事劳动部门根据这个方针，采取了“抽男换女”的办法，从商业、服务行业、邮电、轻工业以及妇女能够胜任的一切工作岗位上，抽调出四万余名年青力壮的男劳动力，将五万余名妇女补充到这些地方去，担任了售货员、服务员、理发员、投递员、话务员、保管员、图书管理员、统计员、炊事员、缝纫员、播音员、保育员、护理员等，有的还担当了机械、修理、毛纺、棉纺、编织、洗染、拆洗、油漆、安装、选煤和各种加工等较轻微的工作。大同煤矿和大同水泥厂对女职工还普遍进行了一次身体检查，根据她们的身体强弱和年龄大小给她们重新调整了工作。并在生活上适当地照顾了她们的特殊利益。大同市委和市人民委员会专门发了指示，规定妇女在月经期间可以适当休息，不做重活，不下冷水；在怀孕三个月以上，要调做轻活；在生育期间，除保证执行五十六天产假的规定外，并在饮食上因地制宜地给一定数量的细粮和葫油；在小孩哺乳期间，要按住宅远近酌量情况给她们一定的喂奶时间。大同电厂除办好托儿所、哺乳室外，对孕妇专门还有孕妇餐。太阳人民公社规定，妇女在月经期间实行翻牌制；怀孕三个月以上，不让做较重的活；生育期间规定休息两个月，并给多分配一部分白面、小米，领回家吃。对奶小孩的母亲，保证每天上下午都有一次喂奶时间。
    广大妇女在劳动中和生活制度上得到照顾后，大大地激发了她们的劳动积极性。分配在商业部门担任售货员的七百四十五名妇女，由于态度和蔼，不怕麻烦，热情地招待顾客，普遍受到群众赞扬。全市全部或大部由妇女组织起来的童鞋、洗染、加工、毛纺、油漆、绣花等大大小小的工厂就有三百三十七个，在这些工厂工作的四千四百三十七名妇女，都很快掌握了技术。（附图片）
