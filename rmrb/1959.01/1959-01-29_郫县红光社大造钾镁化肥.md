The Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, has launched a mass movement to produce native fertilizer, focusing on the manufacture of potassium magnesium fertilizer. In just over a month, the entire commune has built 70 fertilizer plants, trained more than 300 technicians, and produced more than 10,000 jin of potassium magnesium fertilizer. Sichuan Province will promote the experience of this commune throughout the province.

Potassium magnesium fertilizer is a good fertilizer containing various elements. According to the analysis of the Sichuan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, it contains 6%-8% potassium, 2% nitrate nitrogen, and other elements such as magnesium and calcium. According to the actual application test by the working group of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, its fertilizer efficiency is similar to that of ammonium sulfate. One jin is generally equivalent to one load of manure water. It is the most effective and valuable potassium fertilizer in helping crops strengthen stems, fill grains, prevent lodging, and increase disease resistance.

In production, first, finely sieve old wall mud, thousand-foot mud, or artificially cultivated nitrate soil, add 5% plant ash and mix evenly. Then, load it into a large yellow bucket, add water to filter. The first filtrate tastes very weak and can be returned for re-filtering two or three times. When the taste has a relatively strong sour, sweet, bitter, spicy... taste, it can be collected into a pot for boiling. When boiling to yellow-white, add 0.5% quicklime according to the liquid volume (it must be made into lime milk, and raw quicklime must not be directly put in) and continue to boil. When the filtrate in the pot becomes milky white, like thin rice soup (about half of the original filtrate), filter out the sediment with an ash jar or cloth, and then transfer the filtrate back to the pot to continue boiling until the filtrate is like a dry paste, and a special-smelling red smoke is emitted. Then remove it from the pot and transfer it to a wooden box or iron bucket to cool, and it becomes a white or yellowish-white blocky potassium magnesium fertilizer.

### 郫县红光社大造钾镁化肥

    郫县红光社大造钾镁化肥
    本报讯　四川郫县红光人民公社以制造钾镁化肥为中心，掀起了一个群众性的大搞土化肥运动。全公社在短短一个多月内已建起化肥厂七十个，培养出技术工人三百多人，生产出钾镁化肥一万多斤。四川省将在全省推广这个社的经验。
    钾镁化肥是一种含有多种元素的好肥料。根据四川省农业科学研究所的化验，它含有钾6％—8％，硝酸态氮2％，其他还有镁、钙等元素。根据省农业厅工作组实际施用检验，它的肥效和硫酸錏差不多，一斤一般可抵一挑粪水，在帮助作物壮秆、饱满子实、防止倒伏、增加抗病力等作用上它是最有效、最宝贵的一种钾肥。
    生产时先将老墙泥、千脚泥或人工培养的硝泥打细过筛，加5％的草木灰均匀拌合，然后装入大黄桶，加水过滤，最先的滤液味道很淡，可转回去重滤二、三次，到其味有较强烈的酸、甜、苦、辣……等味时，即可收入锅内煮熬。熬至沸腾呈黄白色时，按液量加0.5％的生石灰（必须制成石灰乳，切不可直接放入生石灰）再熬，等锅内滤液变成乳白色的稀米汤状时（约为原来滤液的一半），用灰缸或布滤去沉淀物，再把滤液转回锅内继续煮熬，直到滤液呈干浆糊状，发生特殊气味的红烟时，起锅移至木箱或铁桶内冷却，即成白色或黄白色的块状钾镁肥。
