Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 5th: The Korean National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives, which is of historical significance for the development of Korean agriculture, opened in Pyongyang today. More than 4,600 representatives elected by agricultural cooperatives from all over northern Korea are participating in the conference.

The Chinese agricultural delegation headed by Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, the Soviet agricultural delegation headed by Deputy Minister of Agriculture Petrov, and the agricultural delegations of Bulgaria, Vietnam, Democratic Germany, Mongolia, and Romania were invited to attend the conference. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea were also invited to attend the conference.

The conference adopted two agendas: (1) On the victory of socialist agricultural cooperation in Korea and the future development of agriculture; (2) Draft Regulations of Agricultural Cooperatives. Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a report on the first agenda item at the conference.

In his report, Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that the basic tasks of the Korean agricultural sector are currently: in the next few years, to carry out a technological revolution and a cultural revolution in the countryside, to further consolidate the socialist collective economy politically and economically, and to promote the transformation of the Korean countryside into a prosperous and cultured socialist countryside with modern technology.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that irrigation, mechanization, and electrification are the basic contents of the technological revolution in the Korean countryside. Korea must expand the irrigated area from the current 460,000 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 Chinese mu) to 1 million chongbo in one to two years to realize farmland irrigation in two to three years; in four to five years, supply the countryside with 30,000 to 35,000 tractors and 25,000 to 30,000 trucks to fully mechanize field handling operations; and complete the electrification of the countryside in one to two years.

Premier Kim Il-sung also pointed out that it is necessary to further develop the collective management of agriculture and increase the yield per unit area. He emphasized deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization. He said that, without a doubt, this will make it possible to complete the task of producing more than 7 million tons of grain annually in two to three years.

Premier Kim Il-sung also spoke about the tasks of developing the production of cash crops, vegetables, and animal husbandry, and realizing a cultural revolution in the countryside.

When Premier Kim Il-sung spoke about the achievements Korea had made in agriculture at the conference, he said that the Korean agricultural cooperation movement, which began after the war, had been successfully completed in August 1958. This was a great revolution in the Korean countryside and a brilliant victory for the agricultural policy of the Korean Workers' Party.

Premier Kim Il-sung said: Thanks to the superiority of the collective economy and the selfless labor of the peasants, and by adopting many technical measures, Korea's grain output has been growing rapidly. Grain production already exceeded the pre-war level in 1956, reaching 2.87 million tons, 3.2 million tons in 1957, and increased to 3.63 million tons in 1958, which is about twice that of 1946. This is a bumper harvest that the ancestors of the Korean people could not have imagined for thousands of years.

Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that the collective economy has also played a decisive role in the multi-faceted development of agriculture. Korea's cash crop production, animal husbandry, sericulture, and fruit tree industry have all developed rapidly. In 1958, cotton production reached three times that of 1953. Meat production increased by 2.2 times in the five years after the war.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the rapid increase in agricultural production has consolidated the economic foundation of agricultural cooperatives and rapidly improved the lives of the members. In 1958, each member household received an average of 1,826 kilograms of grain, 501 kilograms of potatoes, and more than 20,000 Korean won, which compared to 1955, grain increased by 50%, potatoes increased by 1.6%, and cash increased by 2.6 times. Poor peasants, who accounted for about 40% of the total number of peasant households just after the armistice, no longer exist. The lives of Korean farmers have generally been raised to the level of middle peasants or higher.

The conference will last for five days.

    金日成首相在朝鲜全国农业合作社大会上强调
    进行技术文化革命建设社会主义农村
    新华社平壤5日电　对于朝鲜农业的发展具有历史意义的朝鲜全国农业合作社大会今天在平壤开幕。参加大会的有朝鲜北部各地农业合作社选出的代表四千六百多人。
    以廖鲁言农业部长为首的中国农业代表团和以彼得洛夫农业部副部长为首的苏联农业代表团以及保加利亚、越南、民主德国、蒙古、罗马尼亚农业代表团都应邀参加了大会。各国驻朝鲜外交使节也应邀参加了大会。
    大会通过了两项议程：（一）关于朝鲜社会主义农业合作化的胜利和农业今后的发展问题；（二）农业合作社章程草案。金日成首相在大会上就第一项议程作了报告。
    金日成首相在报告中指出：目前朝鲜农业部门的基本任务是：在最近几年内，在农村进行技术革命和文化革命，从政治上和经济上进一步巩固社会主义集体经济，促使朝鲜农村转变成为具有现代技术的富裕的和有文化的社会主义农村。
    金日成首相说：水利化、机械化和电气化是朝鲜农村进行技术革命的基本内容。朝鲜要在一、两年内把灌溉面积从现在的四十六万多町步（一町步约合十五市亩）扩大到一百万町步，在两、三年内实现农田水利化；在四、五年内，供给农村三万到三万五千台拖拉机和二万五千到三万辆载重汽车，使田间的搬运作业全部实现机械化；并且要在一、二年内完成农村的电气化。
    金日成首相还指出，要进一步发展农业的集体经营，提高单位面积产量。他强调要深耕、密植、大量施肥。他说，这样就毫无疑问，能够在二、三年内完成年产七百万吨以上的谷物的任务。
    金日成首相还谈到发展经济作物、蔬菜、畜产业生产和在农村中实现文化革命等任务。
    金日成首相在大会上谈到朝鲜在农业上已经取得的成就时说，从战后开始的朝鲜农业合作化运动已经在1958年8月胜利地完成。这是在朝鲜农村中掀起的伟大的革命，也是朝鲜劳动党的农业政策的辉煌胜利。
    金日成首相说：由于集体经济的优越性和农民的忘我劳动，并且采取了许多技术措施，朝鲜的谷物产量不断地迅速增长。1956年谷物产量就已经超过了战前的水平，达到二百八十七万吨，1957年达到三百二十万吨，1958年增加到三百六十三万吨，约等于1946年的两倍，这是几千年来朝鲜人民的祖先所无法想像的丰收。
    金日成首相指出，集体经济在农业的多方面的发展中也起了决定性的作用。朝鲜的经济作物生产、畜牧业、养蚕业和果木业都得到了迅速的发展。1958年棉花产量达到了1953年的三倍。肉类产量在战后五年增加了二点二倍。
    金日成首相说：农业生产的急剧增长，巩固了农业社的经济基础，并且迅速改善了社员生活。1958年入社农户每户平均可分得一千八百二十六公斤粮食、五百零一公斤薯类、二万多元朝币，这同1955年相比，粮食增加了50％，薯类增加了1.6％，现款增加了二点六倍。刚停战时约占总农户40％的贫农现在已经不存在了。朝鲜农民生活已经普遍提高到中农以上的水平。
    这次大会将举行五天。
