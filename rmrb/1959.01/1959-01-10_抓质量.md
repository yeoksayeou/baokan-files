　　Grasping Quality
　　Many regions in Hunan are paying close attention to the quality of locally-made fertilizers. They have adopted many effective methods to help the masses master fertilizer production techniques and ensure the quality of the fertilizer. This approach is worth emphasizing.
　　Whether producing local fertilizer or accumulating farm manure, quality must be emphasized. We fertilize crops to meet the nutrient needs of the crops during their growth. Therefore, the fertilizer we accumulate should not only have a sufficient quantity but also a certain quality, so that it can create conditions for high crop yields. If fertilizer production only focuses on quantity and not quality, then crops will not be able to obtain enough nutrients from a certain amount of fertilizer. This will not only affect the growth and fruiting of crops, affect the great bumper harvest of agricultural production, but also waste a lot of labor in accumulating and transporting fertilizer.
　　How to ensure quality? This requires mastering the techniques. Accumulating farm manure involves technical issues, and producing local fertilizer involves even more technical issues. In this work, we must, like Hunan, firmly grasp the technical issues and solve the technical issues.

    抓质量
    湖南许多地区在制造土化肥中，很注意质量。他们采取许多有效方法，帮助群众掌握制肥技术，保证肥料的质量。这一作法是值得重视的。
    无论制土化肥或积农家肥，都需要讲求质量。我们给农作物施肥，是为了满足作物生长过程中需要的养分。因此我们积制的肥料不但要有足够的数量，同时要有一定的质量，这才能为作物高产多收创造条件。如果积制肥料只注意数量而不注意质量，那么农作物就不能在一定数量的肥料中得到足够的养分。这不但会影响农作物的生长结实，影响农业生产大丰收，而且还浪费了积制肥料和运输肥料的许多劳动力。
    怎样保证质量？这需要掌握技术。积农家肥有技术问题，制土化肥更有技术问题。在这项工作上，我们要像湖南一样，紧紧抓住技术问题，解决技术问题。
