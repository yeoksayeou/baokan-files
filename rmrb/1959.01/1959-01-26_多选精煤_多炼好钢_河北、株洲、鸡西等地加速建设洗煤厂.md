Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 24th: The modern Handan Coal Washery and Matou Coal Washery, which will provide a large amount of high-quality coal to the steel industry, are under intensive construction. These two large coal washeries are both built in Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei Province, which is famous for producing high-grade coking coal, and were started in August and September 1957 respectively. At present, the large-scale main factory buildings and more than ten auxiliary production buildings of these two factories have been erected, and the civil construction is nearing completion. Equipment installation is in full swing, and the equipment installation task of Matou Coal Washery has been more than half completed.

The determination of the builders of the two coal washeries is: to work harder and strive to hand over to production half a year to a year earlier than originally planned, that is, in the second quarter of this year. To this end, the construction department of Matou Coal Washery has established a "Command Headquarters for the Decisive Battle" on the construction site, using the leadership method of the Party Committee taking command, the Secretary taking the lead, and the Department Chiefs leading the troops, to mobilize the masses to engage in a technological revolution to ensure the acceleration of construction and installation speed. The installation workers of Handan Coal Washery, under the slogan of "Install one machine as soon as it arrives," have also widely launched a red flag competition to strive for the top.

Matou Coal Washery is being built with the assistance of the Soviet Union; Handan Coal Washery is designed by our country itself. The production process of the two coal washeries is mechanized and automated. The large amount of refined coal produced after their completion can be used to make coke, which can not only improve the quality of steel, but also select a large amount of gangue contained in the raw coal of Fengfeng Coal Mine, avoiding their useless "long-distance travel," thereby saving transportation costs for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 23rd: Zhuzhou Coal Washery, the first modern coal washery in southern China, is accelerating its construction pace and striving to put it into production in July this year. The civil construction part and steel structure part of this factory have been mostly completed.

In order to ensure that this coal washery can be put into production as soon as possible, at present, the workers undertaking the civil construction and the workers undertaking the installation work have launched a competition to accelerate the progress of the project under the slogan of "both high speed and high quality." The workers responsible for civil construction guarantee to run ahead and create favorable conditions for installation work; the installation workers guarantee to overfulfill the task and keep up with the civil construction.

Zhuzhou Coal Washery is designed by Poland with assistance, and its complete set of equipment will also be provided by Poland. After completion, it can wash 1.8 million tons of raw coal annually. After the raw coal is washed, it is divided into four types: refined coal, medium coal, coal slime, and gangue. Refined coal is mainly used for coking; medium coal is used as power coal; coal slime is used as civilian coal; and gangue can be used as raw material for cement production.

The large amount of raw coal used by this factory will be supplied by coal mines such as Pingxiang in Jiangxi and Zixing in Hunan.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 24th: Jixi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province has adopted a combination of local and foreign methods, and has now built seven small-scale simple coal washeries and one large-scale simple coal washery, which can wash out 750,000 tons of refined coal annually. These refined coal can be used to produce 450,000 tons of metallurgical coke.

The simple coal washeries established by Jixi Coal Mine have simple equipment and production processes. They only use one or several water pumps to press out a strong water flow to wash the coal in dewatering screens made of waste materials and coal washing tanks made of wood. The simple coal washeries run by Chengzihe, Hengshan, and Mashan Coal Mines are all equipped with stagnant equipment from the mines. The coal washery of Jixi Mining School, which processes 200,000 tons of raw coal annually, is also built using the school's teaching aids and small water pumps.

### 多选精煤　多炼好钢  河北、株洲、鸡西等地加速建设洗煤厂

    多选精煤　多炼好钢
    河北、株洲、鸡西等地加速建设洗煤厂
    新华社邯郸24日电　为钢铁元帅提供大量精煤的现代化邯郸洗选厂和马头洗选厂正在加紧施工。这两座大型洗选厂都建设在以产高级炼焦煤著称的河北省峰峰煤矿，是1957年8月和9月份先后动工的。目前，这两个工厂的规模宏大的主厂房，以及十多项附属生产建筑物都已矗立起来，土建工程已经临近尾声；设备安装正在全面进行，其中马头洗选厂的设备安装任务，已经完成了一半以上。
    两座洗选厂的建设者的决心是：以更大的干劲，争取比原计划提前半年到一年以上的时间，即在今年二季度移交生产。为此，马头洗选厂的建设部门在施工现场上成立了“攻坚战指挥部”，以党委挂帅、书记上阵、处长领兵的领导方法，发动群众大闹技术革命，保证加快施工和安装速度。邯郸洗选厂的安装工人在“机器到一台就安装一台”的口号下，也广泛地开展了争上游的红旗竞赛。
    马头洗选厂是苏联帮助我国建设的；邯郸洗选厂是我国自行设计的。两座洗选厂的生产过程都是机械化和自动化的。它们建成后所产的大量精煤炼成焦炭，不仅能提高钢铁质量；同时，还可以把峰峰煤矿原煤中所含的大量矸石选出，避免它们作无益的“长途旅行”，从而为国家节省运费。
    新华社长沙23日电　我国江南第一座现代化选煤厂——株洲选煤厂正在加快建设步伐，争取在今年7月份投入生产。这个工厂的土建部分和钢结构部分已经大部完成了。
    为了保证这座选煤厂能尽快投入生产，目前，担负土建工程的职工和担负安装工程的职工，在“既要高速度又要高质量”的口号下，展开了加快工程进度的竞赛。担负土建任务的职工保证跑在前面，为安装工作创造有利条件；安装工人保证超额完成任务，紧跟上土建工程。
    株洲选煤厂是由波兰帮助我国设计的，其成套设备也将由波兰提供；建成以后，每年能洗选一百八十万吨原煤。原煤经洗选以后，分精煤、中煤、煤泥、矸石四种。精煤主要用于炼焦；中煤作动力用煤；煤泥作民用煤；矸石可作制水泥的原料。
    这个厂所用的大量原煤，将由江西的萍乡和湖南的资兴等煤矿供应。
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省鸡西煤矿采用土洋结合的办法，目前已经建成了七座小型简易洗煤厂和一座大型简易洗煤厂，每年能洗出七十五万吨精煤。用这些精煤，可以炼出四十五万吨冶金焦炭。
    鸡西煤矿兴办的简易洗煤厂，设备和生产过程都很简单，只用一台或几台水泵压出冲击力较强的水流，把煤放在废料做的脱水筛子和木板做的洗煤槽里用水冲洗。城子河、恒山、麻山煤矿办的简易洗煤厂，都是利用矿井的呆滞设备装备起来的。鸡西矿业学校的年处理二十万吨原煤的洗煤厂，也是利用学校的教具和小水泵建设起来的。
