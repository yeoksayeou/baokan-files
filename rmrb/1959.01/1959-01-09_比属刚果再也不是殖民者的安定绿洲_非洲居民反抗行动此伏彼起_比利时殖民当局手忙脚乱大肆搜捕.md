Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Mass resistance actions by African residents against colonial rule in the Belgian Congo continued to rise and fall yesterday.

According to news from Leopoldville, although there are currently no large-scale mass resistance actions in the city of Leopoldville, mass resistance actions by local residents still occurred yesterday in Kimuenza and Kaisangulu near the city, and in Thysville further away.

Many eye-catching slogans could still be seen on buildings in Leopoldville that day: "Long Live the Congo!" and "Independence!" During the large-scale mass resistance action on the 4th, African residents shouted slogans such as "Belgians go back to Europe" and "Long live independent Congo".

The Belgian colonial authorities continued their suppression yesterday. Leopoldville was under martial law all day, and military police patrolled everywhere in jeeps and armored vehicles equipped with machine guns. Military police also searched houses in African residential areas.

Colonial government personnel and police, who had just recovered from their shock, began to reorganize their offices, which had been destroyed during the mass resistance actions.

The resistance of the people of the Belgian Congo has caused great shock in Belgium. Newspapers in Brussels have been publishing relevant reports with large headlines and publishing commentaries in recent days. The Belgian government has decided to send Van Hemelryck, the Minister for the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, to the Belgian Congo to "investigate" the reasons for the resistance actions. But the fundamental reason cannot be concealed even by the right-wing newspapers in Belgium. The Catholic "La Libre Belgique" attributed this reason to "the generally intolerable state of Africans" and called the mass resistance action "the seeds of nationalism."

The Belgian Communist Party parliamentary group has submitted an urgent inquiry to the parliamentary secretariat. Parliament is scheduled to meet today to hear a government report on the incident.

The British "Times" commented on the 7th that "Europeans elsewhere will also feel uneasy because they have always regarded the Belgian Congo as the only peaceful oasis on an increasingly troubled continent. And African nationalists will be encouraged because they will believe that this riot shows that a strong liberation movement has finally unfolded in the Congo." The "Times" also mocked the Belgian authorities, saying: "The Belgians have always participated in the promotion of a myth: that the Congo can avoid the problems (referring to anti-colonialism) that afflict the rest of Africa. As this myth becomes more and more exaggerated, the disappointment (of the Belgian authorities) also increases accordingly."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th Dispatch: Galal, the head of the United Arab Republic delegation attending the recent All-African People's Conference in Accra, the capital of Ghana, issued a statement saying that the people of the United Arab Republic support the struggle of the people of the Belgian Congo against Belgian imperialism.

Galal said that the people of the Belgian Congo should be given political freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 7th Dispatch: "Al-Alam" reported today that the Istiqlal Party of Morocco sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, condemning the Belgian authorities' armed suppression of residents in Leopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, and requesting the Secretary-General of the United Nations to investigate the incident and meet the legitimate desire of the Congolese people for independence in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

The telegram said that the Moroccan people were deeply moved by this bloody incident.

The Istiqlal Party also sent a telegram to the Belgian Foreign Minister to express its protest. The telegram condemned Belgium's armed suppression of the Congolese people as "an imperialist act that violates the spirit of our times."

### 比属刚果再也不是殖民者的安定绿洲  非洲居民反抗行动此伏彼起  比利时殖民当局手忙脚乱大肆搜捕

    比属刚果再也不是殖民者的安定绿洲
    非洲居民反抗行动此伏彼起
    比利时殖民当局手忙脚乱大肆搜捕
    新华社8日讯　比属刚果非洲居民对殖民统治的群众性反抗行动昨天还在此伏彼起地继续着。
    据来自利奥波德维尔的消息，虽然在利奥波德维尔市内目前已经没有大规模的群众性反抗行动，但是在这个城市附近的基穆恩扎和开山古鲁以及稍远一些的太斯维尔，昨天仍然发生了当地居民的群众性反抗行动。
    在利奥波德维尔的建筑物上这一天还可以看到许多醒目的标语：“刚果万岁！”和“独立！”在4日发生大规模群众性反抗行动时，非洲居民高呼“比利时人滚回欧洲”和“独立的刚果万岁”等口号。
    比利时殖民当局昨天继续进行镇压，利奥波德维尔整日处于戒严状态，军警乘着装着机枪的吉普车和装甲车到处巡逻。军警还在非洲居民区逐户搜查。
    惊魂初定的殖民政府人员和警察开始重新布置他们的办公室，这些办公室是在群众性反抗行动中被捣毁的。
    比属刚果人民的反抗在比利时引起了很大震动。布鲁塞尔的各报连日来都用大字标题刊载了有关的报道，并发表评论。比利时政府已决定派刚果和卢安迪—乌隆大臣范埃梅里克去比属刚果“调查”发生反抗行动的原因。但是根本的原因甚至连比利时的右翼报纸也无法加以掩饰。天主教的“自由比利时报”把这个原因归之于“非洲人普遍处于不能忍受的状态”，并且把群众的反抗行动称为“民族主义的萌芽”。
    比利时共产党议会党团已经向议会秘书处提出紧急质询。议会定在今天开会听取政府关于这一事件的报告。
    英国“泰晤士报”7日评论说，“别的地方的欧洲人也将感到不安，因为他们始终把比属刚果看成是在一个愈来愈多事的大陆上的唯一一块安定的绿洲。而非洲民族主义者将欢欣鼓舞，因为他们将认为这次暴乱表明：一次有力的解放运动终于在刚果展开了”。“泰晤士报”还嘲笑比利时当局说：“比利时人一直参与这样一种神话的宣传：刚果能够避免非洲其余部分所患的毛病（指反殖民主义）。由于这种神话愈来愈夸张，因此（比利时当局）失望也就相应地增加了。”
    新华社开罗7日电　出席最近在加纳首都阿克拉举行的全非人民大会的阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团长加拉勒发表声明说，阿拉伯联合共和国人民支持比属刚果人民对比利时帝国主义进行的斗争。
    加拉勒说，应该给予比属刚果人民以政治自由。
    新华社拉巴特7日电　“旗帜报”今天报道，摩洛哥独立党打电报给联合国秘书长，谴责比利时当局对比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔居民的武力镇压，并且要求联合国秘书长对这次事件进行调查，按照联合国宪章满足刚果人民要求独立的合法愿望。
    电报说，摩洛哥人民对这次流血事件深为激动。
    独立党还打电报给比利时外交大臣表示抗议。这个电报谴责比利时对刚果人民武力镇压是“违反我们的时代精神的帝国主义行径”。
