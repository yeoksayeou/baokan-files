    Burning Ash to Create Fertilizer
    The Shihuang Management District of Changle Commune in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, has properly arranged its labor force and, while cultivating spring flowers, has launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation by burning large ash piles. Since mid-December of last year, the management district has burned more than 300 ash piles, totaling more than 100,000 dan.
    This method of accumulating fertilizer is very simple. The raw materials for the ash piles are rice root mud, large tree roots, and firewood. The large tree roots and firewood are placed in the center, and the outside is piled into a circle with rice root mud. The firewood inside is burned, and broken mud is placed on top, which can be burned into charred ash.

    烧灰造肥
    浙江嵊县长乐公社石璜管理区，妥善安排劳动力，在培育春花的同时，掀起了一个大烧灰堆的积肥高潮。管理区从去年12月中旬以来，已烧焦灰三百多堆，约十多万担。
    这种积肥方法很简单，灰堆的原料是稻根泥和大树根、柴等。将大树根、柴放在中间，外面用稻根泥垒成圆形，把里面的柴烧起来，上面放上碎泥，就能烧成焦灰。
