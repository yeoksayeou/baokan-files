　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th, Paris: Yesterday, France formed a new government with Debré as Prime Minister.
　　After De Gaulle took office as President yesterday, he immediately appointed his confidant, former Minister of Justice Debré, as Prime Minister. Since the power to appoint and approve the new government is now entirely concentrated in De Gaulle's hands, this time, from De Gaulle's appointment of Debré to the announcement of the new government's formation, only a few hours passed.
　　Since the power rests with President De Gaulle, a Reuters dispatch quoted a Paris newspaper as saying that Debré (in reality) "is only a Deputy Prime Minister."
　　The Debré government is mainly composed of De Gaulle's "Union for the New Republic," the Independent Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Socialist Party. Seventeen of the twenty-one ministers are ministers from the original De Gaulle government. The "Union for the New Republic" occupies the main departments of the government. In addition to Debré, another of De Gaulle's confidants, Soustelle, who launched the armed rebellion in Algeria last May, serves as the Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister's Office. It is pointed out that Soustelle has great power in the new government and is the number two figure in the new government. Soustelle's legacy as Minister of Information is succeeded by Frey, the Secretary-General of the "Union for the New Republic."
　　There are five members of the Independent Party in the Debré government, and Pinay continues to serve as Minister of Finance and Economy. The Debré government also includes three members of the Popular Republican Movement and one member of the Radical Socialist Party.
　　Due to the growing wave of opposition to France's current economic policies among the broad ranks of grassroots members of the Socialist Party and the working masses under the influence of the Socialist Party, the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party did not dare to openly participate in the Debré government this time. However, Socialist Blochi, in the capacity of a "technical expert," served as the Minister of Education in the new government.
　　The Debré government also includes some so-called "non-party" people, among whom Demeville, the representative of the large monopoly capital group, continues to remain as the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
　　Debré encountered some difficulties in piecing together the list of the new government, according to a United Press International report, because "Debré could not satisfy the demands of the various pro-De Gaulle factions competing for ministerial posts." Another dispatch from this news agency said: "Several powerful political parties opposed Debré's choice of several key ministers, and the debate over the appointment of Soustelle was very intense."

### 戴高乐御用内阁组成

    戴高乐御用内阁组成
    新华社9日讯　巴黎消息：昨天法国成立了以德勃雷为总理的新政府。
    戴高乐昨天就任总统以后，立刻任命了他的亲信、前司法部长德勃雷为总理。由于任命和批准新政府的权力现在全集中在戴高乐一个人身上，这次，从戴高乐任命德勃雷到宣布新政府组成前后只有几小时。
    由于大权是在总统戴高乐手中，路透社一条消息引用一家巴黎报纸的话说，德勃雷（实际上）“只是一个副总理”。
    德勃雷政府主要由戴高乐分子的“保卫新共和联盟”、独立党、人民共和党和激进社会党联合组成，二十一个部长中有十七个是原来戴高乐政府中的部长。“保卫新共和联盟”占据了政府的主要部门，除了德勃雷以外，戴高乐另一个亲信、去年5月发动阿尔及利亚武装暴乱的苏斯戴尔出任驻总理办公厅部长级代表，人们指出，苏斯戴尔在新政府中有极大权力，是新政府中的第二号人物。苏斯戴尔遗留下来的宣传部长由“保卫新共和联盟”的总书记弗雷继任。
    德勃雷政府中有五个独立党人，比内继续任财政经济部长。德勃雷政府中还有三个人民共和党人和一个激进社会党人。
    由于社会党广大基层党员和社会党影响下的工人群众反对法国目前经济政策的浪潮日趋汹涌，社会党右翼领导集团这次不敢再公开参加德勃雷政府，但是，社会党人布洛希以“技术专家”的身份在新政府中担任了教育部长。
    德勃雷政府中还包括一些所谓“无党派”的人，其中，大垄断资本集团的代表德姆维尔继续留任外交部长。
    德勃雷在拼凑新政府名单时候曾经遇到一些困难，据合众国际社报道，这是因为“德勃雷不能满足各派亲戴高乐分子竞争部长的要求。”这家通讯社的另一条消息说：“几个有势力的政党反对德勃雷所选择的几个主要部长，在任命苏斯戴尔的问题上，争论十分激烈”。
