Xinhua News Agency, 17th. To meet the needs of a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the in-depth development of the technological and cultural revolutions, China's paper industry will experience even greater development this year, building upon the achievements already made last year.

The tasks for the paper industry this year are: while fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises, focusing on the construction of necessary large-scale paper mills and a number of medium and small-sized modern paper mills producing cultural and printing paper, industrial technical paper, and industrial packaging paper. This is to ensure the needs of central and provincial Party journals and newspapers, as well as local school textbooks, and to strive to basically meet the needs of industrial technical paper, with a key focus on guaranteeing the supply of packaging paper for cement, pesticides, and the cigarette industry. Actively utilize local resources to develop county and commune-run small paper mills, increasing the supply of paper for people's cultural and daily use. Great efforts should be made to conserve materials such as caustic soda, felt, and copper mesh, find substitutes, and organize enterprises with the necessary conditions to produce raw materials such as caustic soda and bleaching powder.

In 1958, China's paper industry achieved great success. Machine-made paper increased by about 35% compared to 1957, 162 new products were developed, and paper quality also improved. However, this year, China's national economy and scientific and cultural undertakings will experience an even greater leap forward, and the demand for paper will increase exponentially. In order to ensure the high-speed development of China's paper industry and adapt to this need, the Ministry of Light Industry has determined that this year it is necessary to continue implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" with both "large foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" to achieve the above tasks. That is, in existing large and medium-sized enterprises, a mass movement centered on technological revolution should be carried out to fully tap the potential of enterprises. In the people's communes, paper mills should be built on a large scale using indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods.

The inventions and innovations of paper mill workers in various regions during the vigorous technological revolution movement last year laid an excellent foundation for this year's increase in paper production. Workers have made more than 200 technological innovations in major processes such as cooking, pulping, and papermaking alone. Promoting these advanced technologies can greatly increase paper production. The "sealed spiral continuous pulping method" created and used by workers in paper mills in Beijing and Shanghai can increase pulping capacity by 25% to 70%. Shortening the paper pulp cooking time and speeding up the papermaking machine are important measures to promote the increase in paper industry production. Jilin Shixian Paper Mill, Jiamusi Paper Mill, Shandong Paper Mill, and Jilin Paper Mill all have good experience in this area. In addition to requiring paper mills in various regions to summarize and promote these advanced experiences, the Ministry of Light Industry also requires various regions to continue to carry out mass movements, and to vigorously carry out technological revolutions; major paper mills should use their own waste materials and old equipment to build more satellite factories related to paper mills, such as alkali production plants and papermaking machinery plants, so that paper mills can develop in the direction of multiple products and solve their own urgent raw material problems.

People's communes running paper mills on a large scale is an indispensable measure to complete this year's tasks and the most reliable guarantee for achieving self-sufficiency in general cultural paper for counties and communes. Last year's practice proved that the more than 2,000 small factories that were launched and built one after another in various regions have the advantages of low investment, short time, and quick results. In the past, the vast majority of paper required by Henan Province relied on supply from other places. After running small paper mills on a large scale, it is planned to produce 90,000 tons of paper this year, which can achieve self-sufficiency in general paper use. Currently, a surge in building small paper mills is taking shape in various regions. Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are preparing to build more than 2,000 new small paper mills this year. Xinjiang, Guizhou, and Gansu, where the paper industry base was relatively weak in the past, are also actively building paper mills. The period before the spring plowing is a good opportunity for rural people's communes to run paper factories on a large scale. The Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has formed seven working teams to go to various regions to seize this opportunity to assist people's communes in establishing paper mills.

Improving the manufacturing capacity of existing equipment and timely supply of raw materials are the key to the development of the paper industry this year. The Ministry of Light Industry has required large paper mills in Jiamusi, Tianjin, Jilin and other places to manufacture paper machines with a daily output of 30 tons, and other paper mills to manufacture paper machines with a daily output of 10 tons to support various regions; in terms of raw materials, various regions are required to minimize raw material consumption quotas, while making full use of branch materials and bark materials, and continuing to expand the comprehensive utilization of grass fibers. In addition to the supply of raw materials such as caustic soda and soda ash by the chemical industry sector, various regions are required to conserve their use and vigorously adopt indigenous alkali recovery, replace with indigenous alkali, and vigorously develop indigenous alkali production to increase the source of alkali.

    大厂推行技术革新  公社自办小型纸厂
    适应今年工农业更大跃进形势  满足技术革命和文化革命需要
    新华社17日讯　适应工农业生产更大跃进，技术革命和文化革命深入开展的需要，今年我国造纸工业在去年已取得的成就的基础上，将有更大的发展。
    今年造纸工业的任务是：在充分发挥现有企业的潜力的同时，重点建设必要的大型纸厂和一批生产文化印刷用纸、工业技术用纸以及工业包装用纸的中小型现代化纸厂，以保证中央和省级党刊党报和各地学校教科书的需要，争取基本上满足工业技术用纸的需要，并重点保证水泥、农药、卷烟工业包装用纸的供应。积极利用当地资源，发展县、社小纸厂，增加人民文化和生活用纸的供应量。对烧碱、毛布、铜网等材料应大力节约，找寻代用品，并组织有条件的企业生产烧碱、漂粉等原材料。
    1958年我国造纸工业获得很大成就，仅机制纸比1957年增长35％左右，制成新产品一百六十二种，纸的质量也有提高。但是今年我国国民经济和科学文化事业将有更大跃进，对纸的需要量将成倍地增加。为了保证我国造纸工业高速度发展，适应这种需要，轻工业部已确定：今年必须继续贯彻“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路的方针，来实现上述任务。即在现有大中型企业中，大搞以技术革命为中心的群众运动，充分挖掘企业潜力，在人民公社，用土法和土洋结合的办法大办造纸厂。
    去年各地纸厂职工在大闹技术革命运动中的创造发明，为今年造纸工业的增产打下了极为良好的基础。职工们仅在蒸煮、打浆、抄纸等主要工序上就有二百多项技术革新，这些先进技术加以推广后，就可使造纸产量大大提高。北京、上海等造纸厂职工创用的“密闭式螺旋连续打浆法”，可使打浆能力提高25％到70％。缩短纸浆蒸煮时间和加快造纸机速度，是促使造纸工业增产的重要措施，吉林石岘纸厂、佳木斯纸厂、山东造纸厂和吉林造纸厂都有良好的经验。轻工业部除要求各地纸厂总结推广这些先进经验以外，还要求各地继续开展群众运动，大闹技术革命；各大造纸厂要利用本厂废料和旧有设备，多办一些与纸厂有关的卫星工厂，如制碱厂、造纸机械厂等，使纸厂向多产品方向发展，并自己解决迫切需要的原材料问题。
    人民公社大办纸厂，是完成今年任务不可缺少的措施，是做到县、社一般文化用纸自给的最可靠的保证。去年的实践证明，各地先后上马和建成的二千多个小厂，具有投资少、时间短、收效快等优点。过去河南省需要的纸张绝大部分依靠外地供给，在大办小型纸厂后，今年计划生产九万吨纸，可以做到一般用纸自给自足。目前各地建小型纸厂的热潮正在形成。四川、浙江、河北、吉林四省和内蒙古自治区今年准备新建二千多个小型造纸厂。过去造纸工业基础较为薄弱的新疆、贵州、甘肃等地也都在积极兴办纸厂。春耕前这一段时期，是农村人民公社大办造纸工厂的好时机，轻工业部造纸工业局已经组成七个工作队分赴各地，抓紧在这时期内协助人民公社创办纸厂。
    提高原有设备制造能力和及时供应原材料，是今年造纸工业发展的关键。轻工业部已要求佳木斯、天津、吉林等地的大纸厂制造日产三十吨的造纸机，其他各地纸厂要制造日产十吨的造纸机，支援各地；在原材料方面，要求各地尽量降低原材料消耗定额，一面尽量利用枝桠材和板皮等材料，一面继续扩大草类纤维的综合利用。对烧碱、纯碱等原料，除了由化工部门供应以外，要求各地要节约使用，并大力采用土法碱回收、用土碱代替、大搞土法制碱等，增加碱的来源。（附图片）
