    Reporting on Achievements of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine
    Recently, the People's Daily published some reports on how the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine has resulted in significant therapeutic effects for diseases that were previously difficult to treat, which is very encouraging. These reports not only illustrate that the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine will lead to major developments in medical science, but also bring hope of survival to people suffering from intractable diseases. It is hoped that the People's Daily can publish more news in this area in the future.

    报道中西医结合的成果
    最近，人民日报发表了一些中西医结合使难以救治的病症获得显著疗效报道，这很振奋人心。这些报道不仅说明中西医结合将使医学科学有重大发展，而且给患疑难病症的人带来生的希望。今后人民日报还可以多刊登这方面的消息。
