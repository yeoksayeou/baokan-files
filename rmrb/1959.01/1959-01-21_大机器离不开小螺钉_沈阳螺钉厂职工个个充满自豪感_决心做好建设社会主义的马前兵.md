    Big Machines Can't Do Without Small Screws
    Shenyang Screw Factory Workers Are All Full of Pride
    Determined to be the Vanguard of Socialist Construction

    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 20th dispatch) The workers of Shenyang Screw Factory, with the pride of "producing machines is glorious, and producing machine parts is equally glorious," are engaged in vigorous technical revolution, actively increasing the output and quality of screws, and increasing varieties to meet the needs of complete sets of parts for national electromechanical, transportation, and aviation industries.

    Shenyang Screw Factory started specializing in the production of screws in 1954. Later, it gradually developed from producing crude screws needed for railways, forests, and construction to producing precision screws needed for machine tools, automobiles, tractors, generators, transportation, and the aviation industry. In the beginning, many technicians and workers once thought that producing screws was not as promising as producing machine tools and automobiles. After a period of practice, everyone deeply realized the importance of this work. They realized that there are many advantages to producing screw parts by specialized factories, which can adopt advanced technology, have high efficiency, save materials, produce high-quality and low-priced products, and enable machine manufacturing plants to save a large number of machine tools to specialize in machine manufacturing. They also realized that screws are indispensable parts for various machinery, electrical appliances, transportation, and other equipment. A 1A62 lathe has 1,600 screws, and a 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine has as many as 4,000 screws. The number of units from all over the country ordering goods from this factory has increased to more than 280. Some units even flew here to request the supply of urgently needed screws. All the workers in the factory are proud of the "screw" role that the factory plays in socialist construction.

    In order to provide more and better screw parts for national industrial construction, the workers of Shenyang Screw Factory are actively marching towards advanced production technology and production mechanization and automation. In the past six months, the factory has carried out a mass technical revolution movement to vigorously automate manual operations and improve processes. In less than two months, the masses put forward and implemented more than 430 major technical innovation proposals. At present, 90% of the factory's products have adopted advanced technology, using the "tiger eating bones" method of cold forging, which produces one screw at a time, instead of cutting to manufacture various screws. Cold forging is more efficient than cutting and saves materials. Taking the "M12" screw manufactured by this factory as an example, cold forging can produce 1,200 pieces per hour, while cutting can only produce 12 pieces per hour; because cold forging does not cut a large part of the material into powder like cutting, the material utilization rate can reach 80% to 90%, while the material utilization rate of producing screws by cutting is only about 30%.

    Now, many of the factory's old semi-manual operation equipment such as punch presses, cutting machines, thread rolling machines, and friction presses have been converted into automatic production, enabling workers in cutting, cap pressing, punching, and trimming processes to begin to get rid of the heavy labor of manual feeding and unloading, and production efficiency has increased several times. The workers of this factory also made their own iron and manufactured more than 20 sets of equipment such as cold punching presses, automatic thread rolling machines, and automatic cold forging machines. The automatic cold forging equipment they manufactured can automatically complete five processes: cutting, upsetting, barrel shape, upsetting hexagon, and punching. This equipment can produce 60 to 100 screws per minute, and the output of one machine is equivalent to the output of more than 80 machine tools.

    In the mass technical revolution movement, the output of Shenyang Screw Factory has increased rapidly. The factory's output last year increased by more than double that of 1957, and the variety of screws has also increased from 54 to 105. (Lu Munong, Zhao Chunlie)

    大机器离不开小螺钉
    沈阳螺钉厂职工个个充满自豪感
    决心做好建设社会主义的马前兵
    本报沈阳20日电　沈阳螺钉厂职工怀着“生产机器光荣，生产机器配件同样光荣”的自豪感，大搞技术革命，积极提高螺钉的产量和质量，增加品种，满足全国机电、交通运输和航空工业成套产品的配件需要。
    沈阳螺钉厂从1954年开始专门生产螺钉。后来，从生产铁路、森林、建筑等方面所需的粗制螺钉，逐步发展到生产机床、汽车、拖拉机、发电机、交通运输和航空工业所需要的精密螺钉。开始的时候，不少技术人员和工人曾经认为，生产螺钉不如生产机床、汽车有出息。经过一段时间的实践，大家深深地体会到这项工作的重要性。他们认识到由专业性工厂生产螺钉配件有很多好处，可以采用先进工艺，效率高，用材料省，生产出的产品物美价廉，并能使机械制造厂省出大批机床专门从事机器制造工作。他们还认识到，螺钉是各种机械、电器、交通等设备不可缺少的配件。一台1Ａ六二车床上有一千六百个螺钉，一台一千五百瓩汽轮机上的螺钉多至四千个。全国各地到这个厂订货的单位已增加到二百八十多个。有的单位甚至乘飞机到这里要求供给急需的螺钉。全厂职工都为本厂在社会主义建设中起到的“螺丝钉”作用而光荣。
    为了给全国工业建设提供更多更好的螺钉配件，沈阳螺钉厂职工正在积极向先进的生产工艺和生产机械化、自动化进军。最近半年来，全厂开展了大搞手工操作自动化和改进工艺的群众性技术革命运动。不到两个月，群众提出并已实现的重大技术革新建议有四百三十多项。目前，全厂已有90％的产品采用了先进工艺，用“老虎吃骨头”的一轧一个的冷锻方法，代替切削方法制造各种螺钉。冷锻比切削生产效率高，省材料。以这个工厂制造的“Ｍ12”螺钉为例，用冷锻每小时可以生产一千二百个，用切削每小时只能做十二个；由于冷锻不像切削那样要把很大一部分材料切削成粉末，材料利用率可达80％到90％，而用切削方法生产螺钉的材料利用率只有30％左右。
    现在，这个厂有不少的冲床、切料机、搓丝机、磨擦压力机等陈旧的半手工操作设备已经改成自动生产，使切料、压帽、冲孔、切边等工序的工人开始摆脱了双手送料、退料的繁重劳动，生产效率成倍提高。这个厂的职工还自己动手化铁，制造出冷冲床、自动搓丝机、自动冷锻机等设备二十多台。他们自己制造的自动冷锻设备，能自动完成切料、墩平、桶形、墩六角、冲孔等五道工序。这种设备每分钟能生产螺钉六十到一百个，一台的产量相当于八十多台机床的产量。
    在群众性的技术革命运动中，沈阳螺钉厂的产量迅速增长。这个厂去年的产量比1957年增长一倍以上，螺钉的品种也由五十四种增加到一百零五种。（鲁牧农、赵春烈）
