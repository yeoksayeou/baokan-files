This newspaper reports from Kunming on the 5th: The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has adopted a method combining water conservancy and hydropower to vigorously develop electricity generation using indigenous methods. Significant progress has been made in the past six months.

In the latter half of last year, the autonomous prefecture had already built twelve small hydropower stations and one 300-kilowatt thermal power station using indigenous methods. The amount of electricity generated was double that of the first half of the year. Currently, seven more small hydropower stations in the prefecture have completed their infrastructure construction and are awaiting machinery installation. There are also sixty small hydropower stations and four medium-sized power stations under construction, with a total installed capacity of over 110,000 kilowatts.

The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture is located on the south bank of the Jinsha River and has very rich hydropower resources. In addition to the Jinsha River’s mainstream, which contains hydropower resources capable of generating millions of kilowatts, the six major rivers and more than five hundred small rivers within the territory can also be developed. In the first half of the year, the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee organized a force to conduct a general survey of the prefecture's hydropower resources. The Prefectural Committee Secretary also personally led people to conduct field investigations, planning, and design work. Based on the needs of irrigation, water storage, flood control, power generation, navigation, fish farming, industrial water use, and soil and water conservation, a comprehensive plan for the comprehensive utilization of water power was made. Hydropower organizations were established in the prefecture and in some county-level party committees and government departments.

While formulating a comprehensive plan for water power utilization for the entire prefecture, the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee and the county committees, in order to solve the problem of water turbine manufacturing, on one hand, organized carpenters to manufacture water turbines based on the principles of water mills and water grinders. On the other hand, they helped factories trial-produce small-scale power generating equipment. At the same time, they helped various communes to combine the efforts of two personnel (technicians and reservoir managers) and three craftsmen (carpenters, stonemasons, and plasterers) to carry out the construction, installation, and erection of transmission lines for hydropower stations (those without generators first build water turbines and install water mills, water-powered mortars, etc.). Because these measures were practical and feasible, and after a series of publicity discussions among the masses, many people who had doubts about whether backward mountainous areas could build their own power stations also actively took action.

The continuous emergence of small rural power stations has greatly inspired the confidence of farmers of all ethnic groups in building a new socialist countryside. After each power station started generating electricity, it triggered a "chain" reaction in nearby communes. They spread experience through visits and learning, so many power stations were built in a short period.

### 楚雄综合利用水力大办电站

    楚雄综合利用水力大办电站
    本报昆明5日电　云南省楚雄彝族自治州采取水利水力相结合的办法，大搞土法办电运动，半年来已经取得很大成绩。
    去年下半年，自治州已经用土法建成了十二个小型水电站和一座三百瓩的火电站，发电量比上半年增长了一倍。目前，全州又有七座小型水电站已经完成基建任务。只待安装机器。正在兴建的，还有六十个小型水电站和四个中型电站，总装机容量将达十一万多瓩。
    楚雄彝族自治州地处金沙江南岸，水力资源非常丰富，除金沙江干流蕴藏着可以发电数百万瓩的水力资源外，境内六条主要河流和五百多条小河流也都可以开发。上半年，中共楚雄地委就组织力量对全州水力资源进行了一次普查，地委书记也曾亲自带人出去进行踏查、规划和设计工作，根据灌溉、蓄水、防洪、发电、航运、养鱼、工业用水和水土保持的需要，做出了综合利用水力的全面规划，并在州和部分县级党委、政府部门分别成立了水电机构。
    在制定全州水力综合利用规划的同时，中共楚雄地委和各县委在解决水轮机制造方面，一面组织木工根据水磨水碾的原理制造水轮机，一面帮助工厂试制小型发电设备。同时，又帮助各公社采取二员（技术员、水库管理员）三匠（木匠、石匠、泥水匠）结合进行水电站的基建、安装和架设输电线路工作（没有发电机的先造水轮机，安装水磨、水碓等）。由于这些措施切实可行，在群众中进行一系列的宣传讨论后，许多对落后山区能否自办电站曾抱着怀疑态度的人也积极行动起来。
    农村小型电站的不断出现，大大激发了各族农民建设社会主义新农村的信心。每座电站发出电流以后，就在附近的公社里引起“连锁”反应。他们通过参观学习来传播经验，这样许多电站在短时期内就建设起来了。
