To meet the needs of the rapid development of nurseries and kindergartens in rural areas, Jiangsu has adopted short-term training methods at the county level to cultivate and train childcare workers and educators. Nearly 80,000 early childhood educators throughout the province have basically completed one round of training, with training sessions generally lasting five to seven days. During the training, the first step is to establish a professional ideology of doing a good job in early childhood education through great airing of views, great debates. After training, more than 100 educators in Jingjiang County expressed that they wanted to be "red in the kindergarten and expert in the kindergarten." Educators also generally learned basic skills. More than 130 educators in Taicang County have learned two sets of children's gymnastics, more than 30 games and nursery rhymes, and how to make teaching aids. Now, educators generally have a basic knowledge of education work, and children live well in kindergarten, and parents are also very satisfied.

Hebei Province has adopted a variety of methods to train more than 30,000 childcare workers and educators. The training methods are roughly as follows: (1) Centralized training of key personnel, and then conducting general training through them. (2) Learning and doing at the same time, holding short-term training classes for childcare workers in places where childcare work is done best, lecturing, and visiting and practicing on the spot to learn experience. (3) Attaching educator training classes to county-level normal schools and amateur schools run by people's communes. (4) Linking with primary schools to establish an early childhood teacher education network and guidance stations, with primary school teachers providing specific guidance to commune educators and childcare workers.

Through training, most childcare workers and educators have clarified that child care is a noble work to serve the people, and they understand the basic knowledge of early childhood education. Most of the childcare personnel in the suburban areas of Tianjin who participated in the training originally thought that being a childcare worker was not glorious and had no future. After training, many people were willing to be childcare workers for a lifetime. Hao Jinzhen and Wang Jinmin, childcare workers in the Meiman Commune, originally planned to change careers, but after training, they expressed their determination to dedicate all their energy to the childcare cause and vowed to make achievements in educating children. Originally, many people thought that being a childcare worker was just about keeping children from crying, being hungry, or getting hurt. After learning, they learned to educate children using scientific methods. Zhao Yalong, a childcare worker in Xinli Village, originally thought that she was doing a good job, but after training, she felt that she was far behind. She examined that in the past she used one towel and one washbasin to wash the faces of many children, causing many children to suffer from eye diseases, and that children and adults ate the same food, etc., were due to her lack of hygiene knowledge, and she expressed that she would pay attention to hygiene work in the future.

Sichuan Province's trained early childhood childcare workers and educators have taken practical actions to do a good job in childcare. Now, many children in nurseries and kindergartens eat well, play well, are healthy, and are well educated. In the kindergarten of Maicheng Commune, Qianwei County, before the childcare workers were trained, some children suffered from food accumulation disease due to improper diet and lack of attention to cleanliness and hygiene, and the childcare workers lacked nursing experience, and the children's illness could not be cured for a long time. After the childcare workers were trained, they learned nursing experience, and after their careful care, the children's illness was quickly cured, and they generally gained weight. Childcare workers also used the time when children slept during the day and at night to make toys, grow vegetables, and raise chickens. Some childcare workers also learned hairdressing and regularly gave children haircuts. They also established a system of visiting parents to understand parents' opinions and requirements for the kindergarten in order to improve their work in a timely manner.

    训练保育员  办好幼儿园
    江苏河北等省采取多种办法提高保教人员水平
    本报讯　为适应农村托儿所、幼儿园迅速发展的需要，江苏各地以县为单位采取短期训练的办法，培养和训练幼儿保育员和教养员。全省近八万名幼儿教养员基本上已轮训了一次，集训时间一般是五天到七天。集训时，首先通过大鸣大放大辩论，树立做好幼儿教养工作的专业思想。靖江县一百多名教养员经过训练，个个表示要“红在幼儿园，专在幼儿园”。教养员们还普遍学习了基本业务。太仓县一百三十多个教养员每人都学会了两套儿童体操以及三十多个游戏和儿歌，并学会制作教具等。现在，教养员一般都掌握了教养工作的基础知识，孩子们在幼儿园生活得很好，家长们也很满意。
    本报讯　河北省采取多种多样办法，已经训练保育员、教养员三万多人，训练的方法大致有：（一）集中训练骨干，然后通过他们展开普训。（二）边学边做，边做边学，在托儿工作做得最好的地方，举办保育员短期训练班，边讲课，边就地参观实习，学习经验。（三）在县立师范和人民公社办的业余学校里，附设教养员训练班。（四）同小学校挂钩，建立幼儿教师教育网和辅导站，由小学教师具体辅导公社教养员和保育员。
    通过训练，大多数保育员和教养员明确了儿童保育工作是为人民服务的一项崇高的工作，并懂得了幼儿教育的基本知识。天津市郊区原来参加训练的保教人员，多数认为当保育员不光荣，没出息。经过训练以后，许多人愿意当一辈子保育员。美满公社的保育员郝金珍、王金敏原来打算改行转业，受训后，表示决心把全副精力献给保育事业，立志要在教养孩子方面作出成绩。原来很多人认为当保育员就是管得孩子不哭不饿、不砸着碰着就行了。经过学习，学会了用科学方法教养孩子。新立村保育员赵亚同原来认为自己作的满不错，受训练后，感到自己还差的很远。她检查过去用一块毛巾一个脸盆给许多孩子洗脸，不少孩子害眼，以及孩子和大人吃一样饭等等做法是由于自己缺少卫生知识，表示今后要好好注意卫生工作。
    本报讯　四川省受过训练的幼儿保育员和教养员纷纷以实际行动做好保育工作。现在，许多托儿所和幼儿园的孩子都吃得好、玩得好、身体好、受教育好。犍为县买城公社幼儿园，在保育员受训以前，有些小孩因饮食不当和不注意清洁卫生，得了积食病，保育员又缺少护理经验，很长时期孩子的病好不了。保育员受过训后，学到了护理经验，经过她们的细心护理，孩子们的病很快好了，而且普遍增加了体重。保育员们还利用孩子白天和晚上睡觉的时间做玩具、种菜、喂鸡，有的保育员还学会了理发，定期给孩子理发。他们还建立了访问家长的制度，了解家长对幼儿园的意见和要求，以便及时改进工作。
