Women's Enthusiasm for Accumulating Fertilizer is High
In Yigou People's Commune, Tangyin County, Henan, a group of young women in the Yigou Brigade are all highly spirited and actively involved in the battle of accumulating fertilizer.

Yigou Town is close to the railway station, with many passing pedestrians, so the manure in the toilets is always piled high, and there is also a lot of good manure in the fields. In the past, because everyone was busy with other work, no one collected it. Forty women in the brigade volunteered to take on this task. On January 7th, the women got up early, had breakfast, and set off.

Song Jinghua and Wang Fuye ran to the station, searching in every corner. The more they found, the more there was. A small basket couldn't hold it all, so they ran to the porters' union to borrow a large basket, which solved the problem. Zhang Lanfang and Ren Xiuying thought one basket was not enough, so they simply carried two baskets and went to Jizhenzhuang, two miles away, to collect manure. Everyone who saw these lively and capable women praised them, saying, "Diao Chan has come down to earth, and she is really good at collecting manure!"

After the dinner bell rang, pairs of women returned fully loaded. The captain made a count. The original plan was for forty people to accumulate forty baskets of fertilizer per day, but they accumulated one hundred and twenty-six baskets in one day. The women excitedly surrounded the cadres, criticizing them for setting the quotas too conservatively.

    妇女积肥干劲高
    河南汤阴县宜沟人民公社宜沟大队里的一群青年妇女，个个气高志昂，积极投入积肥战斗。
    宜沟镇紧靠车站，来往行人很多，厕所里的大粪老堆得满缸，野外好粪也不少。过去因别的活忙，没有人收拾。队里四十名妇女自告奋勇，要担当这个活计。1月7日，妇女们起早吃了饭，就出发了。
    宋景花、王福叶跑到车站，各个角落里找，愈找愈多，拾的一个小筐装不了，跑到搬运工会借了个大筐，才算解决了问题。张兰芳、任秀英嫌一个筐不济事，干脆抬了两个筐，跑到二里远的棘针庄拾粪。大家看见这样活泼能干的妇女，夸奖道：“貂蝉下地啦，拾粪真能干！”
    晚饭钟响了以后，一对对满载回归。队长统计了一下，原计划四十人，日积肥四十筐，一天就积了一百二十六筐。妇女们兴奋地围着干部，批评他们制订定额太保守了。
