Greet the New Year with Whipping Spurs
    Gao Shiqi
    1959 has arrived, marking the tenth year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is the year with the most decisive impact on changing the face of our motherland through three years of hard work. It is also a year when all aspects of our national work will achieve greater development and a greater leap forward. Our entire nation welcomes her with joy and excitement.

    The past year was a year of overall great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    Grain production records have been surpassed one after another, shining brilliantly.

    Iron flowed, steel bloomed, and the entire nation fought for 10.7 million tons of steel, achieving unprecedented victory.

    Encouraged by the general line for building socialism, everyone was full of energy and high morale, engaging in technical and cultural revolutions, all striving to promote a greater leap forward in the motherland with even greater labor achievements.

    The past year was a year when the East wind continued to prevail over the West wind. In the Middle East and in the Taiwan Strait of our country, imperialism repeatedly carried out provocations, but suffered disastrous defeats time and time again. The forces of peace are growing stronger, and national independence movements are flourishing. It is truly a case of the enemy rotting away day by day, while we are getting better day by day.

    The past year was also a year of communization for the entire nation. Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers united into one big family, establishing public canteens and nurseries on a large scale, greatly liberating female labor. Schools were established on a large scale in rural areas and factories, and the integration of education and productive labor also achieved great success.

    Under this new revolutionary situation, how should our science and technology work catch up?

    Indeed, in the past year, under the leadership of the Party, our science and technology work has made many new achievements. In the past year, a series of national exhibitions were held in the capital, such as the National Agricultural Tool Reform Exhibition, the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, the National Science and Technology New Achievements Exhibition, the National Medical and Health Exhibition, the National Youth Socialist Construction Exhibition, and the Exhibition of the Integration of Education and Productive Labor. Those who visited the exhibitions cast their astonished and surprised eyes on these colorful and dazzling exhibits. These outstanding exhibits represent the crystallization of mass labor and wisdom, collectively created by ordinary workers, ordinary peasants, and young people.

    These products powerfully illustrate that only by following the mass line under the leadership of the Party, and leveraging the power and wisdom of the collective, can we reliably guarantee the high-speed development of science and technology work.

    It should be stated that after more than a year of rectification campaigns and anti-rightist struggles, the political consciousness of the worker-peasant masses and the general science and technology workers has been raised, and their thinking has been greatly liberated. This has made us realize that the Party can lead all work, and science and technology work is no exception. Science and technology work must obey the absolute leadership of the Party. Not only do we need the Party's leadership in guidelines and policies, but we also cannot do without the Party's leadership in business. Therefore, we must all listen carefully to the Party, be the Party's docile tools, and serve the people wholeheartedly, serving socialist construction.

    Vice Premier Nie pointed out at the National Science Association, National Popular Science Association, and National Congress of Representatives: "Our goal for the second five-year plan is to master the most important 'cutting-edge' science and technology as soon as possible, catch up with the world's advanced countries in industrial science and technology, and complete the summary of China's unique and rich experience in agriculture and medicine, and be in the most advanced position in the world." To this end, we must continue to work hard to ensure the realization of these great tasks put forward by the Party.

    At the beginning of this new year, let us rally around this great goal, be full of confidence, whip our horses, and forge ahead bravely!

    快马加鞭迎接新的一年
    高士其
    1959年来到了，这是中华人民共和国建国的第十个年头；这是苦战三年改变我们祖国面貌最有决定性作用的一年；也是全国各方面工作将获得更大发展更大跃进的一年。我们全国人民都以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接她。
    过去的一年，是工农业生产全面大跃进的一年。
    粮食丰产纪录一个盖过一个，大放异彩。
    铁水奔流，钢花怒放，全民为一千零七十万吨钢而战，已经取得空前大胜利。
    在建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，人人都干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，大闹技术革命和文化革命，都争取以更大的劳动成绩促进祖国更大的跃进。
    过去的一年，是东风继续压倒西风的一年，在中东，在我国台湾海峡，帝国主义虽然一次又一次地进行挑衅，但一次又一次遭到惨败。和平的力量日益强大，民族独立运动蓬勃发展起来了，真正是敌人一天一天地烂下去，我们一天一天地好起来。
    过去的一年，又是全国人民公社化的一年，工农商学兵团结成一个大家庭，大办公共食堂和托儿所，妇女劳动力得到大解放。农村和工厂大办学校，教育和生产劳动相结合，也获得大丰收。
    在这种新的革命形势下，我们的科学技术工作应当怎样迎头赶上呢？
    的确，这一年来，在党的领导下，我们的科学技术工作有了不少的新成就。这一年来，在首都举办过一连串全国性的展览会如全国农具改革展览会、全国工业交通展览会、全国科学技术新成就展览会、全国医药卫生展览会、全国青年社会主义建设展览会以及教育和生产劳动相结合展览会等都是，参观过展览会的人们，都曾以惊讶诧异的眼光投射在这些万紫千红琳琅满目的展品身上，而这些出色的展品代表了群众劳动和智慧的结晶，它们都是由普通工人、普通农民和青年人集体创造出来的。
    这些产品都有力的说明了，只有在党的领导下走群众路线，发挥集体的力量和智慧，才是科学技术工作取得高速度发展的可靠保证。
    应当说明，经过一年多来的整风运动和反右派斗争，工农群众和一般科学技术工作者政治觉悟提高了，思想大大解放了，使我们认清了党是能领导一切工作的，科学技术工作也不能例外，科学技术工作必须服从党的绝对领导，不仅在方针政策上需要党的领导，就是在业务上也离不开党的领导，因此，我们都必须好好地听党的话，作党的驯服工具，全心全意为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务。
    聂副总理在全国科联全国科普全国代表大会上指出：“我们在第二个五年计划期间的奋斗目标是：尽快掌握最重要的‘尖端’的科学技术，在工业科学技术方面赶上世界先进的国家；在农业和医学方面要完成中国特有的丰富经验的总结工作，而居于世界上最先进的地位。”为此，我们就要继续苦战，保证实现党提出的这些伟大任务。
    在这新的一年开始的时候，让我们围绕着这个伟大目标，满怀信心，快马加鞭，奋勇前进吧！
