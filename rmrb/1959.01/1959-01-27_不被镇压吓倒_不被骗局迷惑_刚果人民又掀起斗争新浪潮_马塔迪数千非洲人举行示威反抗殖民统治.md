Xinhua News Agency, January 26th, Matadi dispatch: A demonstration against Belgian colonial rule took place in the Congolese port city of Matadi on the 25th.

Thousands of Africans threw stones at Belgian official institutions. The colonial authorities opened fire to suppress the demonstration, and some Africans were injured.

This incident occurred when the Belgian colonial authorities were holding a meeting to explain Belgium's so-called "reform plan." The Belgian authorities attempted to use this deceptive plan to quell the Congolese people's resistance. Many Africans gathered near the venue, demanding that the authorities listen to their opinions.

However, the colonial authorities dispatched police to suppress them. The resistance quickly developed, and some Belgian colonial institutions were attacked by the masses.

Following the incident, the Belgian authorities erected barriers between the African and European residential areas of the city and announced a curfew in the African residential area from that evening until the following morning. Military police patrolled back and forth in the African residential area.

Matadi is Congo's only port, and all the precious minerals produced in Congo are shipped out through this port. The city is located in western Congo, about three hundred kilometers from Leopoldville, the capital of Congo, where large-scale resistance has recently taken place.

    不被镇压吓倒　不被骗局迷惑
    刚果人民又掀起斗争新浪潮
    马塔迪数千非洲人举行示威反抗殖民统治
    新华社26日讯　马塔迪消息：刚果的港口城市马塔迪25日发生了反抗比利时殖民统治的示威行动。
    数千名非洲人向比利时官方机关投掷石块。殖民当局开枪进行镇压，有一些非洲人受伤。
    这次事件发生在比利时殖民当局召开一次会议解释比利时的所谓“改革计划”的时候，比利时当局企图用这个欺骗性的计划来平息刚果人民的反抗行动。许多非洲人聚集在会场附近，要求当局听取他们的意见。
    但是，殖民当局出动了警察进行镇压。反抗行动迅速地发展开来，一些比利时殖民机关受到群众的攻击。
    在事件发生之后，比利时当局在这个城市的非洲人住区和欧洲人住区之间筑起了障碍物，并且宣布从当天傍晚到次日清晨在非洲人住区施行戒严，军警在非洲人住区来回巡逻。
    马塔迪是刚果唯一的港口，刚果出产的各种珍贵的矿石都是通过这个港口运出的。这个城市位于刚果西部，距最近发生大规模反抗行动的刚果首府利奥波德维尔约三百公里。
