    Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on launching a manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign:

    I. Meeting the fertilizer needs for a huge increase in crop production is a decisive factor in striving for an even greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. In 1959, deep plowing and dense winter sowing were implemented relatively universally across the country, and dense planting will also be implemented relatively universally in spring sowing. Therefore, more fertilizer must be applied than in 1958. The Central Committee has decided to launch a national mass campaign for manure accumulation and fertilizer production during the spring plowing preparation period. Current agricultural production should focus on carrying out manure accumulation and fertilizer production, implementing "fertilizer in command," and driving various other agricultural activities.

    II. In order to rapidly launch a high tide in the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign, all localities must immediately expand publicity, call on everyone to take action, and accumulate manure. The main tasks of manure accumulation and fertilizer production at present are to prepare sufficient topdressing fertilizer for wheat and rapeseed, and to prepare sufficient fertilizer for spring-sown crops. All localities and people's communes must formulate fertilizer plans in accordance with the crop planting plans, assigning personnel, quantities, quality, and time, and formulate remuneration and reward methods to immediately distribute the tasks. At the same time, government offices, troops, schools, and urban residents must also actively participate in this national blitz manure accumulation campaign, provided that it does not affect work, military training, or study. In rural people's communes, tasks should be assigned to each team, group, and household. In urban areas, tasks should also be assigned to grassroots units such as government offices, troops, and schools.

    III. The main avenues for manure accumulation and fertilizer production are the following three aspects:

    First, vigorously accumulate human and animal waste, smoke fertilizer, ferment fertilizer, and manufacture compost. Combine the raising and management of livestock and poultry with the patriotic health campaign, with everyone accumulating and making fertilizer. Do not abandon any small fertilizer source. Pay attention to covering and shading when collecting and using human and animal waste, adding straw and soil, and pay attention to covering with mud and soil when making compost and fermenting fertilizer to minimize fertilizer loss.

    Second, vigorously develop local chemical fertilizers. Vigorously rectify, strengthen, and replenish local chemical fertilizer plants, rely on the masses, and actively solve raw material and manufacturing technology problems. Relevant scientific and technological institutions must provide practical assistance.

    Third, strengthen the field management of green manure. Green manure is the main base fertilizer for early rice, and time should be seized immediately to strengthen management, increase the application of fertilizers rich in phosphorus and potassium, and increase the fresh grass yield per unit area.

    IV. During the high tide of the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign, labor forces should be properly arranged, and attention should be paid to improving quality, saving labor, and improving labor efficiency. Seize the manure accumulation and fertilizer production link to drive field management, spring sowing preparation, tool reform, and sideline production. At the same time, improve manure accumulation and fertilizer production methods, and promote field-side manure accumulation, composting, and smoke fertilization; implement cattle pens, pig pens, and sheep pens to the fields, and move livestock to the fields as much as possible according to the conditions. Also vigorously reform tools for manure accumulation, fertilizer production, fertilizer transportation, and fertilizer application, focusing on transportation tools, to achieve vehicle transportation, ship transportation, and cableway transportation to improve labor efficiency.

    V. All localities should widely adopt various forms such as telephone conferences, radio conferences, big-character posters, on-site visits, and appraisal competitions to strengthen publicity, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and rapidly push the campaign to a high tide. Report the progress of the campaign and the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated to the Ministry of Agriculture once a week.

    中共中央、国务院发布指示
    立即掀起全民积肥造肥高潮
    农村城市都动员起来，人人动手为农作物增产准备充足肥料
    新华社28日讯　中共中央、国务院关于开展积肥造肥运动的指示
    一、满足农作物巨大增产所必需的肥料，是争取一九五九年农业生产更大跃进具有决定性的环节。一九五九年全国比较普遍地实行了深耕和冬播密植，春播也将比较普遍地实行密植，因此必须比一九五八年施用更多的肥料。中央决定在春耕准备期间掀起一个全国规模的全民性的积肥造肥高潮。当前农业生产，应以开展积肥造肥为中心，实行“肥料挂帅”，带动其他各种农事活动。
    二、为了迅速掀起积肥造肥运动高潮，各地必须立即扩大宣传，号召人人动手，大家积肥。当前积肥造肥的主要任务就是为小麦、油菜准备充足的追肥，为春播作物准备充足的肥料。各地各人民公社都必须按照农作物种植计划，作好肥料规划，定人、定量、定质、定时，并且定出报酬和奖励的办法，把任务立即分配下去。同时，机关、部队、学校和城镇居民在不影响工作、练兵、学习的条件下，也必须积极参加这次全民突击的积肥运动。在农村人民公社要把任务布置到各队、各组、各户。在城镇也要把任务布置到机关、部队、学校等基层单位。
    三、积肥造肥的主要途径是以下三个方面：
    第一，大力积攒人、畜粪便，熏肥，沤肥，制造堆肥。结合家畜、家禽的饲养管理和爱国卫生运动，人人积肥造肥。不放弃任何细小的肥源。在收集和利用人、畜粪便时要注意加盖遮阴，垫草、垫土，在制造堆肥、沤肥时要注意糊泥盖土，尽量减少肥分损失。
    第二，大搞土化肥。大力整顿、加强和充实土化肥厂，依靠群众，积极解决原料和制造技术问题。有关科学技术机关，必须切实给以帮助。
    第三，加强绿肥的田间管理。绿肥是早稻的主要基肥，目前应即抓紧时间，加强管理，增施含磷、钾质较多的肥料，提高单位面积的鲜草产量。
    四、在积肥造肥运动高潮中，要妥善安排劳动力，要注意提高质量，节省劳动力，提高劳动效率。要抓住积肥造肥这个环节，将田间管理、春播准备、工具改革、副业生产都带动起来。同时要改善积肥造肥方法，提倡田头积肥、沤肥、熏肥；按照条件的可能实行牛圈、猪圈、羊圈到田，移畜就田。还要大力改革积肥、造肥、运肥、施肥的工具，改革的重点是运输工具，作到运肥车子化、船运化、索道化以提高劳动效率。
    五、各地都要广泛采用电话会、广播会、大字报、现场参观、评比竞赛等多种多样形式，加强宣传，及时交流经验，把运动迅速推向高潮。每周要把运动的进度和所积肥料的数量和质量等情况向农业部汇报一次。
    一九五九年一月二十八日
