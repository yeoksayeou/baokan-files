The butchers of South Vietnam must not escape the net of justice!
Zhang De

    On December 1, 1958, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime of South Vietnam—the agent of U.S. imperialism—carried out a shocking and barbaric massacre at the Phu Loi concentration camp in Thu Dau Mot Province, South Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime inhumanly poisoned the food of six thousand political prisoners, killing more than a thousand Vietnamese patriots. This heinous atrocity by the South Vietnamese authorities can only be compared to the crimes of the Hitlerite fascist bandits in slaughtering prisoners of war in concentration camps such as Auschwitz during World War II, and the large-scale massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by American executioners during the Korean War. But it must also be pointed out that this atrocity occurred four years and four months after peace had been restored in Vietnam, and the perpetrators of the mass killings were those who claimed to be “compatriots” of the victims. This makes the massacre even more outrageous. This large-scale massacre fully exposed the madness and bestiality of the South Vietnamese authorities and their master, U.S. imperialism. It aroused the public outrage of the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving and righteous people around the world, and became the most vivid teaching material for educating the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries to rise up against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    The Phu Loi concentration camp was a large prison in South Vietnam disguised as a "Central Re-education Center." As everyone knows, since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the United States and its agents in South Vietnam have never ceased their conspiracies to undermine and obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. In the early days of the ceasefire in Vietnam, the United States blatantly dispatched fleets and allocated huge sums of money to buy over reactionary elements in Vietnam as assistants, using rumors, deception, threats, and intimidation to abduct hundreds of thousands of Catholics from North Vietnam to the South. At the same time, under the direction of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities implemented a fascist policy of terror against patriots in South Vietnam who demanded peace, unity, independence, and democracy. According to incomplete statistics, in the first year after the ceasefire alone, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime created more than three thousand terrorist incidents in various parts of South Vietnam, causing more than four thousand casualties and imprisoning nearly twenty thousand people. From the second half of 1955, because the South Vietnamese authorities, under the instruction of the United States, openly refused to negotiate for the realization of Vietnam's general election and unification, they were unanimously opposed by the people of both North and South Vietnam. Under such circumstances, Ngo Dinh Diem further created a so-called "denunciation of the communists" movement to persecute South Vietnamese patriots who demanded peace and unification. Many prisons and concentration camps were established and expanded at this time, and the Phu Loi concentration camp was one of the most famous.

    The Phu Loi concentration camp is located north of Saigon, 33 kilometers from Saigon. It was built by the Japanese army during the Pacific War, covering an area of 120 hectares, surrounded by walls as high as three meters and twelve gloomy bunkers. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime sent nearly a thousand American-equipped security teams to guard the camp. Since June 1958, it has regularly held about six thousand male and female political prisoners. Most of these political prisoners were patriots from all walks of life who had participated in the war of resistance in the past. After being arrested, most of them were imprisoned without trial, and it was not certain when they would be released. They suffered inhuman abuse in prison, often eating only moldy rice soaked in limewater, receiving no medical treatment when they were sick, and being subjected to torture or beatings almost every day. Therefore, everyone was either emaciated or bloated, or suffered from lung disease or malaria, and several people died every day. Any supplies from their families were inhumanly banned by the South Vietnamese authorities.

    After the Ngo Dinh Diem clique struck on December 1, 1958, the political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp let out painful moans and cries for help. Many people had paralyzed limbs, their eyes rolled back, and they fell to the ground and died. When everyone discovered the mass poisoning, they tried their best to rush out. Some climbed onto the roof and threw tiles outwards, shouting for help. At this time, the security team of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime inhumanely opened fire on the political prisoners and used the water cannons of fire trucks to spray them. More than a thousand people died that day, and most of the others were also in critical condition. Nearby residents heard the cries for help and came to assist, but were blocked by armed security teams. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime initially spread rumors that so many people died in the concentration camp due to a cholera outbreak, but when the fact that dogs also died from poisoning after eating the leftover food of the political prisoners was presented to the people, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime fabricated rumors of political prisoners committing suicide by taking poison. But this heinous crime cannot be covered up. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime and its American master owe the Vietnamese people a new blood debt. Blood debts must eventually be repaid with blood. The South Vietnamese executioners who slaughtered patriots cannot escape the net of justice.

    General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, on January 18, 1959, sent a telegram to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam, exposing this shocking massacre in peacetime, lodging a serious protest with the South Vietnamese authorities, and pointing out that this incident seriously violated the Geneva Accords regarding the prohibition of individual or collective retaliation against former resistance personnel and their families. The representative of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army specifically pointed out at a press conference that the South Vietnamese special agents at the Phu Loi concentration camp, who directly committed the massacre, had received specialized training in the United States. From this, it is not difficult to see what role U.S. imperialism played in this great massacre of South Vietnamese patriots.

    The Vietnamese people have angrily risen up to fight, protesting the bloody atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities who have become agents of the United States. Righteous voices around the world are expressing sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people.

    南越的刽子手决不能逃脱人民的法网！
    章德
    1958年12月1日，南越吴庭艳政权——美帝国主义的代理人，在南越土龙木省富利集中营，进行了一次骇人听闻的野蛮大屠杀。吴庭艳政权灭绝人性地在六千名政治犯的饭里下了毒药，杀死了一千多名越南的爱国者。南越当局这一罪恶滔天的暴行，只有第二次世界大战期间希特勒法西斯匪徒在奥斯威辛等集中营屠杀战俘的罪行，和朝鲜战争期间美国刽子手对朝、中战俘的大规模屠杀可以比拟。但是必须同时指出的是，这次暴行发生在越南和平已经恢复了四年又四个月之后，而进行集体屠杀的凶犯，又是以被惨杀者的“同胞”自居的。这就使这次惨杀案更加令人发指。这一大规模的屠杀案件，完全暴露了南越当局和它的主子美帝国主义的疯狂和兽性。它激起了越南人民和全世界爱好和平及有正义感的人民的公愤，成了教育越南人民和全世界各国人民起来反对美帝国主义和它的走狗的最生动的教材。
    富利集中营是以“中央整训中心”为幌子的南越一座大监狱。大家都知道，自从越南和平恢复以来，美国和它在南越的代理人，从没有停止过破坏和阻挠日内瓦协议实施的阴谋活动。在越南停战初期，美国曾明目张胆地派遣舰队和拨出巨款，在越南境内收买反动分子做助手，用造谣、欺骗、威胁、恫吓等手段，把几十万天主教徒，从越南北方劫到南方。同时，南越当局在美国的指使下，对南越要求和平、统一、独立、民主的爱国者，施行法西斯恐怖政策。据不完全的统计，仅停战后最初一年间，吴庭艳政权就在南越各地制造了三千多起恐怖事件，致使四千多人遭受伤亡，近两万人被捕监禁。从1955年下半年起，由于南越当局在美国的授意下，公开拒绝为实现越南普选、统一而进行协商，因此遭到越南南北人民的一致反对。在这样的情况下，吴庭艳就进一步制造所谓“控诉共产党”的运动，以迫害要求和平、统一的南越爱国者。许多监狱和集中营都在这个时候建立和扩大起来，富利集中营就是其中著名的一个。
    富利集中营位于西贡的北部，距西贡三十三公里，是日本军队在太平洋战争期间建筑的，占地一百二十公顷，四周有高达三公尺的围墙和十二个阴森森的碉堡。吴庭艳政权派了近千名全副美式装备的保安队在这里看守。自从1958年6月以来，这里经常监禁约六千名男女政治犯。这些政治犯，大多是过去参加过抗战的各阶层爱国者。他们被捕后，大多没有经过审讯就被监禁起来，而且也不确定监禁到什么时候。他们在狱中受着惨无人道的虐待，经常只吃用石灰水浸过的发霉的米饭，病了得不到医治，几乎每天都免不了遭受酷刑或毒打。因此每个人不是骨瘦如柴或面目浮肿，就是患肺病或疟疾，每天都有数人死亡。家属对他们的任何供应，都被南越当局惨无人道地禁绝。
    吴庭艳集团在1958年12月1日下了毒手以后，富利集中营的政治犯发出了惨痛的呻吟和求救声，许多人手足瘫痪，眼睛翻白，倒下地后就死去了。当大伙发现集体中毒后，就竭尽全力向外冲，有的爬上屋顶，扔屋瓦向外大声呼救。这时吴庭艳政权的保安队，竟毫无人性地向政治犯开枪射击和用救火车的水龙喷射。当天有一千余人死亡，其余的人也大多生命垂危。附近的居民听到呼救声前来援助，但却遭到荷枪实弹的保安队的阻挡。吴庭艳政权开始时造谣说，集中营一下子死那么多人是由于发生了霍乱，但当狗吃了政治犯剩下的饭也中毒而死的事实摆在人们的面前时，吴庭艳政权又捏造政治犯服毒自杀的谣言。但是这一滔天罪行是掩盖不住的。吴庭艳政权和它的美国主子，又欠下越南人民一笔新的血债。血债最后必须用血来偿还。屠杀爱国者的南越刽子手，是不能逃脱人民的法网的。
    越南人民军总司令武元甲大将，在1959年1月18日，致电越南国际委员会主席安萨里，揭露这一骇人听闻的和平时期的大屠杀案，向南越当局提出了严重的抗议，并指出这一事件严重地违反了日内瓦协议关于不得对前抗战人员及其家属加以个别或集体报复的规定。越南人民军总司令部代表，特别在记者招待会上指出：直接制造惨杀案的富利集中营的南越特务人员，曾经在美国受过专门训练。由此不难看出，美帝国主义在这次屠杀南越爱国者的大惨案中，扮演了一个怎么样的角色。
    越南人民已经愤怒地起来进行斗争，抗议成为美国代理人的南越当局的血腥暴行。全世界正义的呼声，都在对越南人民表示同情和支持。
