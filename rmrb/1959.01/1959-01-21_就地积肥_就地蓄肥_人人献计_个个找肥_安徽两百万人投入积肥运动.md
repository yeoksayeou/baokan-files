Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th – Currently, over two million people in people's communes across Anhui Province are engaged in the movement of collecting, producing, and transporting fertilizer. They are adopting various methods to work hard and cleverly, and the quantity of manure collected and produced is increasing rapidly. In the past two months or so, the province has accumulated more than 61 billion dan of natural fertilizer. Since the beginning of the new year, an average of more than 1 billion dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer has been collected daily, doubling the previous rate. More than 200,000 local fertilizer plants across the province are in production, having already produced more than 8 million dan of local fertilizer and granular fertilizer.

    In the manure collection movement, various areas of the Fuyang Special District have adopted the "two on-the-spot" methods, namely, on-the-spot manure collection and on-the-spot fertilizer storage, with everyone contributing fertilizer ideas and everyone finding fertilizer sources. More than 500,000 people throughout the district are fixedly participating in manure collection every day, having accumulated 24 billion dan of various fertilizers, accounting for 40% of the winter-spring manure collection task. The Lu'an Special District has extensively promoted the methods of on-the-spot fertilizer smoking and field-edge fertilizer composting. Forty-six million mu of winter fields throughout the district have already been "baked," and 1.34 million new field-edge cellars and composting pools have been dug, preparing sufficient fertilizer for summer harvest crops and greatly saving labor for fertilizer transportation. In the Anqing Special District, various areas use idle soil in the field ditches of summer harvest crops to burn fire manure on the spot, using it while burning, which not only top-dressed the fertilizer but also prevented frost.

    In the manure collection movement, various areas not only attach importance to quantity but also try every means to improve the quality of manure collection and fertilizer production, achieving "one fineness," that is, collecting more fine manure and improving fertilizer production technology. Of the 21 billion dan of natural fertilizer that has been accumulated in the Bengbu Special District, human and animal manure accounts for more than 4 billion dan, and the proportion of fine fertilizer has increased from about 15% in previous years to more than 20%. The entire special district has also built 170,000 temporary toilets at water conservancy and iron and steel construction sites to accumulate manure. Through visits and internships, various people's communes in Chaoxian County have improved and enhanced local fertilizer production technology. More than 300 local fertilizer plants in the county have manufactured more than 30 kinds of local fertilizers with good quality and high fertilizer efficiency, such as ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and sodium hydroxide.

    In order to improve labor efficiency and accelerate the delivery of fertilizer to the fields, many places are vigorously manufacturing and modifying manure collection and transportation tools, replacing shoulder carrying with wheelbarrows, flatbed carts, rubber-wheeled carts, etc., implementing "one -ization," that is, the vehicle-ization of fertilizer transportation. According to statistics, from last year to January 13 this year, the province has manufactured more than 3,158,000 pieces of manure collection and transportation equipment. Thirty-two counties and two hundred townships have all adopted carts to transport fertilizer.

    In the movement of collecting, producing, and transporting fertilizer, party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership, assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible at each level, and established an inspection and acceptance system. Party committees at all levels in Lujiang County regard fertilizer as a strategic measure to increase production. A deputy secretary of the party committee from the county to the production brigade of the commune is specifically responsible for leading manure collection. The county has established 5,936 manure collection professional teams at the production team level, and additionally, there are 23,671 local fertilizer plants and one chemical fertilizer plant.

    During the manure collection movement, party committees at all levels promptly convened on-site meetings to summarize and exchange experiences, impart technology, train technicians, and guide manure collection work to ensure the quality of fertilizer. Some places encourage subsidiary labor and commune members to collect manure during spare time, achieving price according to quality and reasonable remuneration. In order to complete the manure collection task and solve the problem of insufficient labor, many areas have adopted a combination of short-term shock tactics and professional teams. In order to meet the needs of top-dressing summer harvest crops, in addition to more than 1,600 professional teams and 26,000 people specializing in manure collection, Su County also temporarily transferred more than 140,000 people from the field management professional team to carry out a concentrated manure collection effort, dividing them into three groups for manure collection, transportation, and top-dressing, adopting the method of collecting, transporting, and top-dressing simultaneously, so that all 530,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the county were top-dressed once.

    就地积肥　就地蓄肥　人人献计　个个找肥
    安徽两百万人投入积肥运动
    据新华社合肥20日电　安徽各地人民公社目前有两百多万人投入积肥、造肥、运肥运动。他们采取各种办法大干巧干，积肥造肥数量增加很快。两个多月来，全省已积攒自然肥料六百一十多亿担，新年开始平均每天积攒土杂肥十多亿担，比以前的进度加快一倍。全省有二十多万个土化肥厂正在生产，已经造出土化肥、颗粒肥八百多万担。
    阜阳专区各地在积肥运动中，采取了“两就”办法，即就地积肥、就地蓄肥，人人献肥计，个个找肥源。全区每天固定五十多万人参加积肥，已积各种肥料二百四十多亿担，占冬春积肥任务40％。六安专区大量推广就地熏肥、田头沤肥办法，全区冬田已经烧包子的有四十六万亩，新挖田头窖和沤肥池一百三十四万个，为夏收作物准备了充足肥料，并且大大节省了运肥劳力。安庆专区各地利用夏收作物田沟闲土就地烧火粪，边烧边用，既追了肥，又防了冻。
    在积肥运动中，各地不仅重视数量，而且千方百计地提高积肥、造肥质量，做到“一细”，即多积细肥，并提高化肥生产技术。蚌埠专区已积的二百一十亿担自然肥料中，人畜粪尿占四十多亿担，细肥比例由往年15％左右提高到20％以上。全专区并在水利和钢铁工地上搭盖临时厕所十七万个，用来积蓄粪尿。巢县各人民公社通过参观和实习，改进和提高了土化肥生产技术，全县三百多个土化肥厂已经制造出硫酸铵、硫酸钾、氢氧化钠等三十多种质量好、肥效高的土化肥。
    为了提高劳动效率，加速把肥料送到田里，很多地方大力制造和改制积肥运具，以独轮车、平板车、胶轮车等代替肩挑，实行“一化”，即运送肥料车子化。据统计，从去年到今年1月13日，全省已制造积肥运具三百一十五万八千多件。有三十二个县，二百个乡已全部采用车子送肥。
    在积肥、造肥、运肥运动中，各地党委都加强了领导，层层固定专人负责，并且建立了检查验收制度。庐江县各级党委把肥料当作一项增产的战略措施来抓，从县到公社的生产大队都有一个党委副书记专门领导积肥。全县以生产队为单位，建立了五千九百三十六个积肥专业队，另外还办土化肥厂二万三千六百七十一个，化学肥料厂一个。
  各级党委在积肥运动中，及时召开现场会议，总结交流经验，传授技术，培训技术员，指导积肥工作，以保证提高肥料的质量。有些地方鼓励附属劳动和社员利用空隙时间积肥，做到按质论价，合理付酬。许多地区为了完成积肥任务，解决劳动力不足的问题，采取了短期突击和专业队相结合的办法。宿县为了满足夏收作物追肥的需要，全县除平时有一千六百多个专业队，二万六千多人专门积肥以外，又临时从田间管理专业队中抽调十四万多人开展突击积肥，分成积肥、运肥、追肥三套班子，采取边积、边运、边追办法，使全县五十三万多亩夏收作物全部追了一次肥。
