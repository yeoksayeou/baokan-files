Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 8th: Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, is actively taking measures to organize the masses to engage in spare-time cultural learning and consolidate literacy achievements.

Last year, Jingjiang County achieved great success in literacy work, and many farmers can now recognize over a thousand characters. However, many people can only read some of the characters they have learned, but cannot write or use them, which cannot meet the needs of production and life. They are urgently requesting further improvement of their cultural level.

In response to the above situation, since the beginning of winter, the county has taken measures to strengthen farmers' spare-time education work. Currently, over 50,000 migrant workers have been organized to participate in spare-time learning on water conservancy construction sites. The county has assigned some cultural and educational cadres, literacy instructors from various communes, and full-time spare-time school teachers to the construction sites to specifically be responsible for publicity and organizing learning. It has also trained over 1,000 propaganda and education workers who serve as both propagandists and cultural teachers. Various types of spare-time schools have also been established in various townships and villages, organizing over 40,000 people to participate in learning. For those who have not yet reached the literacy standard, a form of contracted teaching and guaranteed learning is adopted to gradually bring them up to the literacy standard. Those who have already become literate are organized to study politics, technology, and culture. Cultural courses include Chinese language and arithmetic. Arithmetic focuses on practical problems, abacus, and measurement. The Chinese language course is combined with agricultural technology and other professional knowledge. In addition to the textbooks compiled by the county, some brigades also compile their own materials based on local conditions and central tasks. For example, when studying the contradiction between current labor and tasks, the Baimu Brigade used rhyming slogans related to this issue as teaching materials, which not only enabled the students to recognize characters, but also improved the ideological understanding of the commune members, and properly solved the problem of labor shortage.

    巩固扫盲成果
    靖江县加强农民业余教育工作
    新华社南京8日电　江苏省靖江县积极采取措施，组织群众进行业余文化学习，巩固扫盲成果。
    靖江县去年扫盲工作取得很大成绩，很多农民都认识了一千多字。但许多人对已认识的字有些只会读不会写和用，不能满足生产和生活需要，迫切要求进一步提高文化。
    针对以上情况，这个县在入冬后，采取措施加强农民业余教育工作。目前，在水利工地上已组织了五万多民工参加业余学习，县里指派一部分文教工作干部和各公社扫盲辅导员、专任业余学校教师到工地具体负责宣传和组织学习；还培养了一千多名宣教员，既做宣传员，又做文化教员。在各乡各村，也办起了各类业余学校，组织了四万多人参加学习。对还未达到扫盲标准的人，采取包教保学的形式，使他们逐步达到扫盲标准。已经脱盲的，组织他们学习政治、技术、文化。文化课有语文和算术。算术以实用题、珠算、测量等为主。语文课和农业技术等业务知识相结合。教材除县编外，有些大队还结合中心任务就地取材自编，如柏木大队在研究当前劳力和任务的矛盾时，就以有关这一问题的顺口溜等为教材，不仅使学员们识了字，并且提高了社员们的思想认识，妥善地解决了劳动力紧张的问题。
