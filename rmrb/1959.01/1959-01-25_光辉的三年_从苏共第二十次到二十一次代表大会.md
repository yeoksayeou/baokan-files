    The Glorious Three Years
    ——From the 20th to the 21st Congress of the CPSU
    Chen Quanbi
    The 21st Congress of the CPSU, which is universally anticipated by all progressive people in the world, is about to open. The short three-year period since the 20th Congress of the CPSU has been a period of great significance in the history of the CPSU and the cause of communist construction in the Soviet Union. During this period, the CPSU waged a struggle against the anti-Party group, thereby consolidating and strengthening the unity of the Party. It also adopted many important measures in developing the economy, such as the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, the reorganization of tractor stations, and the reform of the agricultural product purchasing system. In addition, reforms were carried out in the national education system to link schools with life. In accelerating the development of socialist productive forces, the mechanization and automation of production, the chemicalization and electrification of industry, and specialization and cooperation were further implemented. In science, within a period of less than two years, the successful launch of three artificial satellites and one cosmic rocket was achieved. The Soviet Union also carried out large-scale housing construction and improved the people's lives in all aspects during these three years. As Khrushchev pointed out in his report to voters last February: The tremendous achievements made since the 20th Congress of the CPSU not only accelerated the pace of communist construction in the Soviet Union but also represented a "qualitative leap."
    One of the significant measures taken and major achievements made in the past three years is the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, which is an extremely important measure to accelerate the development of productive forces under socialism. Soviet economists have unanimously pointed out that the reorganization of industry and construction in the Soviet Union has brought new vitality to the vigorously developing socialist productive forces. As a result of this reorganization, the Soviet government abolished 141 industrial ministries, and more than 56,000 industrial cadres were streamlined. The 104 economic regions established nationwide based on the industrial reorganization accepted the decentralization of enterprises that accounted for more than 75% of the country's product production from the central government. A large number of economic leaders were decentralized, and they either became heads of national economic committees or leaders of factories and enterprises. Although the time since the industrial reorganization has not been long, as Khrushchev said, "the great superiority of the new form of industrial management has been demonstrated." One of the most prominent achievements of the industrial reorganization is that the production volume of the original factories and enterprises allocated to various economic regions has greatly increased. According to the materials of the most recent year, production increased by 17 billion rubles in the year after the industrial reorganization compared to the previous year. The period for completing plans in various economic regions was also advanced, and the amount of excess increased. Due to the specialization and cooperation of enterprises, leadership close to production, and full utilization of local resources and all other production conditions, production potential has been further brought into play, and workers' enthusiasm and production initiative have also been improved compared to the past. The industrial reorganization also plays a very important role in accelerating the training of various technical cadres and reducing production costs.
    Last year, the Soviet Union achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, with a grain harvest of 8.5 billion poods. If calculated according to the current population of the Soviet Union, each person in the Soviet Union can obtain 1,400 catties of grain. In milk production, the Soviet Union's production last year caught up with and surpassed that of the United States, and meat increased by 2.1 million tons compared to 1953. Now the speed of agricultural development in the Soviet Union far exceeds that of the United States. According to statistics, the average growth rate of agricultural products in the Soviet Union reached 7.1%, while in the United States it was 1.1%. The growth rate of meat in the Soviet Union was 6.2%, while in the United States it was 1.3%. The growth rate of milk in the Soviet Union was 9.6%, while in the United States it was 0.9%. The rich fruits achieved by the Soviet Union on the agricultural front are all the result of the correct implementation of agricultural policies by the Central Committee of the CPSU. Since the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1953, due to the correct implementation of the policy of reclaiming wasteland by the Central Committee of the CPSU, the area of arable land in the Soviet Union has expanded dramatically in the past three years, and the Soviet Union's plan to obtain 2 billion poods of grain annually from wasteland has also been fully realized. It should be pointed out that the measures of reclaiming wasteland are not simply to expand the area of arable land, but more importantly, to carry out the specialization of agricultural areas. The reorganization of tractor stations in March last year was another major measure taken by the CPSU to develop agriculture. Since machinery and land are concentrated in the hands of the collective farms, the situation of the separation of technical equipment from collective farm production that has existed in agriculture for many years has been completely overcome. Due to the reorganization of tractor stations, the technical foundation of collective farms has been greatly strengthened. As of now, 83% of the collective farms nationwide have purchased machinery, and all collective farms now own 1.7 million tractors, 700,000 trucks, and 500,000 grain harvesters. The leadership strength of the farms has also been greatly enhanced. Many station chiefs of tractor stations have become chairmen, party committee secretaries, or members of the management committee of the farms. Since the machinery belongs to the farms, the cultivation period and the quality of cultivation have been improved compared to the past, and the yield per unit area has also increased compared to the past. In the next seven years, according to the indicators proposed by Khrushchev in the outline of the seven-year plan report, agriculture will make further progress on the basis of current achievements.
    In recent years, Soviet science and technology have continued to produce miracles, successfully launching three artificial earth satellites and one cosmic rocket in one year and two months. The successful launch of artificial satellites is the first step for mankind to conquer outer space, and the successful launch of this cosmic rocket has created conditions for mankind to realize interstellar travel. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has also built the world's first "Lenin" atomic icebreaker, manufactured intercontinental ballistic rockets, manufactured the Tu-114 turboprop aircraft, the world's longest-range aircraft after the Tu-104, and built a 10 billion electron volt synchronous phase-stable accelerator. At present, the Soviet Union has also greatly surpassed the level of the United States in mathematics, atomic physics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, and geophysics. All the above achievements eloquently prove that the socialist system has created unparalleled superior conditions for the development of science.
    The Soviet people are closely united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee, and resolutely struggle to realize the Party's various policies and lines. Under the guidance of the Party, the Soviet people have a high degree of communist consciousness and a determination to accelerate the building of communism. In recent years, the more intimate concern of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union for further improving the people's material welfare and cultural life has further aroused the Soviet people's infinite love and support for the Party and the government. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has put forward various major tasks in meeting the material and cultural needs of the people: "The total amount of agricultural products and the average output per capita should exceed the current level of the United States within seven years", "The problem of housing shortage should be completely solved within ten to twelve years", "The problem of shortage of shoes and clothes should be solved within five to seven years", "The output of cotton should be doubled within twelve to fifteen years". The proposal of these magnificent tasks can imagine what huge efforts the Soviet government and people will make. The realization of these huge tasks will mean that the living standards of the Soviet people will further approach the level of communism. In the three years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made great efforts to improve and improve the people's material welfare and cultural living standards. In terms of housing construction, the total area of construction in the past three years has reached more than 155 million square meters, which is equivalent to the total construction area of the entire Fifth Five-Year Plan period. Commodity circulation reached more than 1,850 billion rubles. Preferential treatment funds paid to the elderly reached more than 132 billion rubles. At present, the Soviet Union is also taking various measures to shorten the working hours of workers and staff, increase the wages of low-paid personnel, and further improve various social welfare facilities.
    In the next seven years, more efforts will be made to improve the people's material welfare and improve the people's living standards. Aren't all of these proofs of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government's meticulous care for the people?
    In the three years since the 20th Party Congress, due to the struggle against the anti-Party group by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee has been further consolidated, and the Party's various policies and lines are being smoothly promoted. Due to the brilliant achievements made by the Party and the government in communist construction in recent years, the Party's prestige and trust among the entire people have been further enhanced. The activists who emerged in communist construction poured into the Party's ranks in large numbers, and they have become the new backbone and new force of communist construction. Due to the further strengthening of the Party's ideological work and the implementation of the Leninist Party style, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer, the connection has become closer, and the guiding role of the Party in the entire communist cause has been further strengthened. In the months since the CPSU decided to convene the 21st Congress, the labor competition launched throughout the Soviet Union to welcome the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and the communist labor team movement launched to welcome the great seven-year plan, fully demonstrate the Soviet people's infinite love for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and their trust and support for the Party's policies. The 21st Congress of the CPSU is about to open in Moscow. This Congress will adopt the magnificent communist construction program of the seven-year plan and will make more brilliant and greater contributions to the communist construction of the Soviet Union and the cause of human progress.

    光辉的三年
    ——从苏共第二十次到二十一次代表大会
    陈泉璧
    为全世界进步人类所一致瞩望的苏共第二十一次代表大会，就要开幕了。在苏共第二十次代表大会以来短短三年的这段期间，是苏共历史和苏联共产主义建设事业的一个具有重大意义的时期。在这个期间，苏共进行了反对反党集团的斗争，从而巩固和加强了党的团结，在发展经济方面也采取了许多重要的措施，例如工业和建筑业管理形式的改组，拖拉机站的改组，农产品收购制度的改革；此外还进行了使学校和生活联系的国民教育制度的改革。在加速发展社会主义的生产力方面，则进一步实行了生产的机械化和自动化，工业的化学化与电气化，专业化和协作化。在科学上，在两年还不到的时期内成功地发射了三次人造卫星和一次宇宙火箭。苏联还在这三年中大规模地进行了住宅建筑和在各方面提高了人民的生活。赫鲁晓夫去年2月对选民所作的报告中这样指出：苏共二十次代表大会以来所获得的这样巨大的成就，不仅是苏联共产主义建设速度的加快，而且是一种“质的飞跃”。
    三年来所采取的重大措施并已获得重大成就之一，是工业与建筑业管理形式的改组，这是在社会主义条件下加速发展生产力的一项极重要的措施。苏联的经济学家曾一致指出：苏联的工业与建筑业的改组，给蓬勃发展的社会主义生产力带来新的生命力。由于实行这次改组，苏联政府撤销了一百四十一个工业部，有五万六千多工业干部被精简；根据工业改组在全国成立起来的一百零四个经济区接受了中央下放的占全国产品生产75％以上的企业；经济领导干部实行了大批下放，他们或者做了国民经济委员会的负责人，或者做了工厂企业的领导者。工业改组后的时间虽不长，但正如赫鲁晓夫所说：“新的工业管理形式的巨大优越性已经表现出来”。工业改组最突出的成果之一，就是拨交各经济区的原有工厂企业的生产量都大大提高了。根据最近一年来的材料，工业改组后一年比前一年增产了一百七十亿卢布。各经济区完成计划的期间也提早了，超额的数量也增多了。由于企业实行专业化与协作化，领导接近生产，地方资源与其它一切生产条件的充分运用，生产潜力得到了进一步发挥，工人们的劳动热情与生产积极性也比从前要提高，工业改组对于加速培养各种技术干部和降低生产成本也起着十分重要的作用。
    去年苏联获得了前所未有的农业大丰收，谷物的收获量达到八十五亿普特。假使按苏联现有人口计算，苏联每人可以得到粮食一千四百市斤。在牛奶生产上苏联去年的生产量已赶上并超过了美国，肉类比1953年增加了二百一十万吨。现在苏联农业发展的速度大大超过了美国。据统计，苏联农产品平均增长的速度达到7.1％，而美国是1.1％，肉类增长的速度苏联是6.2％，而美国是1.3％，奶类苏联是9.6％，美国是0.9％。苏联在农业战线上所获得的这样丰盛的果实，都是苏共中央正确地贯彻农业政策的结果。自1953年苏共中央九月全会以来，由于苏共中央正确地实现了开垦荒地的政策，使苏联的耕地面积在近三年来有飞跃的扩大，而苏联准备在荒地上每年获得二十亿普特谷物的计划也已完全实现。应该指出：开垦荒地的措施，不仅是简单地扩大耕地面积，而更重要的是进行农业地区专业化的分工。去年3月拖拉机站的改组，是苏共为发展农业而采取的又一重大措施。由于机器和土地集中在农庄的手里，多少年来在农业上所存在的那种技术设备与农庄生产相割裂的局面已完全克服。由于拖拉机站的改组，集体农庄的技术基础已大大加强了。截至目前止，全国已有83％的集体农庄购买了机器，而全体集体农庄现拥有一百七十万台拖拉机，七十万辆载重汽车，五十万台谷物收割联合机。农庄的领导力量也大大增强了，许多拖拉机站的站长做了农庄的主席、党委书记或农庄管理委员会的成员。由于机器归农庄所有，耕作期间与耕作质量都比从前提高了，单位面积产量也比从前有所增加。在未来的七年中，根据赫鲁晓夫在七年计划报告提纲中所提出的指标，农业还要在现在成就的基础上百尺竿头更进一步。
    近年来苏联的科学技术不断涌现出奇迹，在一年又两个月的时间内，成功地发射了三次人造地球卫星和一次宇宙火箭。人造卫星的发射成功，是人类征服宇宙空间的第一步，而这次宇宙火箭的发射成功，又为人类实现星际航行创造了条件。苏联在近两年来还建成了世界上第一艘“列宁号”原子破冰船，制成了洲际弹道火箭，制成了继图一○四后的全世界最远程的图一一四涡轮螺旋桨飞机，建成了一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器。目前苏联在数学、原子物理学、化学、天文学、物理学与地球物理学等方面也都大大超过了美国的水平。上述这一切成就，雄辩地证明了社会主义制度为科学的发展创造了无比优越的条件。
    苏联人民紧密地团结在苏联共产党和它的中央周围，坚决地为实现党的各种政策和路线而奋斗。苏联人民在党的教导下具有着高度的共产主义的觉悟和加速建成共产主义的决心。近年来，苏联共产党和政府对于进一步提高人民物质福利和文化生活水平的更亲切的关怀，更加激起了苏联人民对党和政府的无限热爱和拥戴。苏联共产党在满足人民的物质和文化生活的需要上，提出了各种重大的任务：“七年内农产品总量和按人口计算的平均产量要超过美国现在的水平”、“十年到十二年内要彻底解决住宅不足的问题”、“五年至七年内要解决鞋类和衣服不足的问题”、“十二至十五年内棉花产量要增加一倍”。这些雄伟任务的提出，可以想像到苏联政府和人民将要作出怎样巨大的努力。这些巨大任务的实现，将意味着苏联人民的生活水平将要进一步接近共产主义的水平。在苏共第二十次代表大会后的三年来，苏联共产党在改进和提高人民的物质福利和文化生活水平方面曾作出了巨大的努力，在住宅建筑方面，三年来建筑的总面积达到一亿五千五百多万平方公尺，相当于整个第五个五年计划时期全部建筑面积的总和。商品流转达到一万八千五百多亿卢布。发给年老人的优抚金达到一千三百二十多亿卢布。目前苏联还在采取各种办法缩短工人和职员的工作时间，提高低薪资人员的工薪和进一步改进各种社会福利设施。
    在今后七年中，在改进人民的物质福利和提高人民的生活水平上还要作出更多的努力。所有这一切，难道不都是苏联共产党和政府对人民的无微不至的关怀的明证吗？
    第二十次党代表大会后的三年来由于苏联共产党进行了反对反党集团的斗争，苏联共产党及其中央的团结是更加巩固了，党的各种政策和路线在顺利地推行着。由于党和政府近年来在共产主义建设中所获得的辉煌成就，党在全体人民中的威望和信赖是更加提高了。在共产主义建设中所涌现出的积极分子，大批地涌进党的队伍，他们成为共产主义建设的新的骨干，新的生力军。由于党的思想工作的进一步加强和列宁式党的作风的贯彻，党和群众的关系更亲密了，联系更紧密了，党在整个共产主义事业中的指导作用更加强了。在苏共决定要召开二十一次代表大会的几个月来，在整个苏联国土上所掀起的为迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会所举行的劳动竞赛，为迎接伟大的七年计划所展开的共产主义劳动工作队运动，充分表现了苏联人民对苏联共产党的无比热爱和对党的政策的信赖和拥护。苏共二十一次代表大会就要在莫斯科开幕了。这次代表大会将要通过七年计划的雄伟的共产主义建设纲领，将对苏联的共产主义建设和人类的进步事业作出更辉煌更伟大的贡献。
