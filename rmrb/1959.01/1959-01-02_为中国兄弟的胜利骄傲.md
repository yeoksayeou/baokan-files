    Proud of the Victory of Chinese Brothers
    Albania Anton Kotte
    At the time of the 1959 New Year, a loyal friend extends heartfelt congratulations to you—my dear brothers.
    1958 has ended. Everyone has the best memories of the past year in their minds and hearts. I also have a most beautiful memory. In this year, I visited the People’s Republic of China and had a good opportunity to further understand the heroic, wise, and hardworking Chinese people, and to understand the invincible army that faithfully guards the borders of their great motherland. This is the most precious gift that 1958 brought me.
    Now I am sitting by the warm fireplace of my home, and the Chinese comrades I met in the People’s Republic of China in October and November constantly appear in my mind. I recall the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, the steel smelters by the small blast furnaces in Nanjing, the members of the people's commune in the suburbs of Hefei, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Wuxi, middle school students, and university students.
    What kind, hospitable, hardworking, and lovely people they are!
    Among them, I felt as if I was living among brothers and sisters as close as siblings, as happy and free as I am now by the fireplace in my own home.
    Comrades, I am with you, enjoying the joy of your victories, laughing as you laugh. I feel happy for every furnace of steel, every grain of rice, and every foundation stone laid for the indestructible socialist fortress. Like you, I am proud of these victories and proud of the bright future of fraternal China.
    Dear comrades, you are hardworking, lovely, simple, and tireless people. Wherever I went, I saw you working happily and enthusiastically to implement the tasks put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. You deeply love your motherland, the glorious Party, the Soviet Union, and other countries of the socialist camp. You are good soldiers for peaceful coexistence and the defense of peace. We always take you as an example, and your labor and victories constantly inspire us.
    At this New Year, dear comrades, I sincerely congratulate you on achieving further success on the road of socialist construction. I wish you more steel, grain, and various crops in 1959. I wish your lovely motherland a bright future, prosperity, and strength.
    Greetings to you from distant Albania.

    为中国兄弟的胜利骄傲
    阿尔巴尼亚　安东·柯特
    值此1959年新年的时候，一个忠实的朋友向你们——我亲爱的兄弟们致以衷心的祝贺。
    1958年结束了。每一个人在他的脑子里和心里都留下了往年最美好的回忆。我也有一个最美好的回忆，这一年中，我访问了中华人民共和国，获得了良好的机会进一步了解英勇、智慧和勤劳的中国人民，了解忠实地守卫着他们伟大祖国边防的不可战胜的军队。这就是1958年带给我的最珍贵的礼品。
    现在我坐在温暖的家庭的壁炉旁，在我的脑海里不断地浮现起我10月、11月在中华人民共和国所会到的那些中国同志。我回忆起了鞍钢的工人，南京小高炉旁的钢铁冶炼者，合肥郊区人民公社的社员，无锡的解放军的战士，中学生和大学生。
    他们是多么善良、好客、勤劳和可爱的人啊！
    在他们中间，我感到自己像是生活在亲如手足的兄弟姐妹中间一样，就像现在在自己家里的壁炉旁这样的愉快和自由。
    同志们，我和你们在一起，享受着你们胜利的愉快，和你们一样的欢笑。我为每一炉钢水、每一粒稻米和每一块坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒奠基石而感到幸福。我和你们一样，为这些胜利而感到骄傲，为兄弟般的中国的光辉未来而感到骄傲。
    亲爱的同志们，你们是勤劳、可爱、朴实和不倦的人们。我所到之处，看到你们为贯彻党中央和毛主席提出的任务而愉快和热情地劳动着。你们非常热爱你们的祖国、光荣的党、苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国，你们是和平共处和保卫和平的好战士，我们始终以你们为榜样，你们的劳动和胜利不断地鼓舞着我们。
    在这新年的时候，亲爱的同志们，衷心地祝贺你们在社会主义建设的道路上获得进一步的成就。祝你们在1959年中获得更多的钢铁、粮食和各种农作物。祝你们可爱的祖国光芒万丈、繁荣富强。
    在遥远的阿尔巴尼亚衷心地向你们致意。
