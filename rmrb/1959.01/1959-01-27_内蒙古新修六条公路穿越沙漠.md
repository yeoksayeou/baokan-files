Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 26th: Six highways have been built in the western desert areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. These six highways are: from Sandao Kan near the Yellow River in Bayannur League to Jianguo Camp in Ejin Banner; from Xilinhot in the northern part of Xilin Gol League to Ba昌 in the south; from Duolun County to Dabeigou; from Dabuchak Town in Uxin Banner, Ikezhao League, to Batu Bay; from Dabuchak Town to Yulin County in Shaanxi Province; and from Wulan Town in Otog Banner to Chengchuan on the border of northern Shaanxi. The six highways have a total length of more than 1,600 kilometers, of which about 400 kilometers cross the desert area, and are now all open to traffic.

The completion of these highways is of great benefit to promoting economic and cultural exchanges within and outside the Autonomous Region, strengthening national unity, and promoting production and construction in remote areas. Now, livestock, animal products, minerals, salt and other materials that are abundant in many remote areas along the highway can be smoothly transported out. The means of production and daily necessities needed by people of all ethnic groups can also be supplied in a timely manner.

Building highways in desert areas is still a pioneering undertaking for Inner Mongolia. During the Great Leap Forward last year, people of all ethnic groups in the western part of the Autonomous Region formed a road construction army, overcame various difficulties such as sparse population, lack of water, and inconvenient food and lodging in the desert, and not only built the highways, but also accumulated a lot of experience in desert control and road construction in the process of road construction.

    内蒙古新修六条公路穿越沙漠
    新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区西部沙漠地带建成了六条公路。这六条公路是：从巴彦淖尔盟黄河附近的三道坎到额济纳旗建国营，从锡林郭勒盟北部的锡林浩特到南部的宝昌，从多伦县到大北沟，从伊克昭盟乌审旗达卜察克镇到巴图湾，从达卜察克镇到陕西省榆林县，从鄂托克旗乌兰镇到陕北边界的城川。六条公路共长一千六百多公里，其中有四百公里左右穿越沙漠地带，现在已全部通车。
    这些公路建成后，对促进自治区内外经济文化交流，加强民族团结，推动偏远地区的生产建设都有很大好处。现在，沿公路线的许多偏远地区盛产的牲畜、畜产品、矿石、食盐等物资都能顺利的运出。各民族人民需用的生产工具和日用品也能够得到及时的供应。
    在沙漠地带修建公路，对内蒙古来说还是创举。去年大跃进中，自治区西部各族人民组成一支筑路大军，克服了沙漠中人烟稀少、水源缺乏、食宿不便等各种困难，不但把公路修成了，在筑路过程中，民工们还积累了许多治沙筑路的经验。
