Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th: Jiangsu Province's patriotic sanitation campaign to eliminate the "five pests," emphasize hygiene, and eradicate diseases before the Spring Festival has begun throughout the province. The broad masses are closely combining production with large-scale sanitation work.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a province-wide broadcast meeting on the 20th regarding the elimination of the five pests, emphasizing hygiene and eradicating diseases. The meeting called on all areas to closely center their work around rectifying and consolidating the people's communes, to fully mobilize the masses in a patriotic sanitation campaign in close combination with production, so that people can happily, joyfully, and cleanly welcome the Spring Festival. The Suzhou, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Nantong and other regional Party committees, and the Nanjing Municipal Committee, have all established command structures for the sanitation campaign based on the instructions of the Provincial Committee, and have fully prepared for the campaign. The Suzhou Special Zone has organized four work groups to go to various counties to inspect the progress of the campaign. Many counties and people's communes have convened mobilization rallies to eliminate the five pests.

Sheyang County adopted the method of mobilizing, organizing, and acting simultaneously, holding broadcast meetings and telephone conferences at all levels to deploy sanitation work. The county has transferred some medical and health personnel to work with the masses in the sanitation campaign. In the past few days, more than 90,000 people in the county have participated in the campaign. According to statistics from three communes, in three days they caught 2,998 rats, 2,820 sparrows, and collected more than 200,000 dan of garbage. Many production brigades in the county are combining sanitation with large-scale fertilizer accumulation. For example, several production teams in the Guangming Commune accumulated more than 16,200 dan of fertilizer in two or three days by combining sanitation work. Many commune members have carried out major furniture relocations in the sanitation campaign, achieving clean windows and bright tables, creating a fresh new look. Danyang County recently mobilized the people of the county to catch sparrows, and in one and a half days they caught more than 11,000 sparrows and eliminated more than 2,100 rats. All counties in the Yangzhou Special Zone are closely combining deep winter plowing with large-scale winter snail eradication work.

In order to strengthen leadership over the campaign, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee recently organized a sanitation inspection team to go to various areas and people's communes to inspect various sanitation efforts.

    新华社南京30日电　江苏省春节前除五害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的爱国卫生突击运动已在全省各地开始展开，广大群众正紧密结合生产大搞卫生工作。
    中共江苏省委在20日召开了全省除五害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的广播大会，要求各地紧紧围绕整顿、巩固人民公社的工作，密切结合生产充分发动群众开展一次爱国卫生突击运动，使人们欢欢喜喜、高高兴兴、干干净净地迎接春节。中共苏州、常州、扬州、徐州、南通等地区党委和南京市委都根据省委指示，建立了卫生突击运动作战指挥机构，充分地作好战前准备。苏州专区组织了四个工作组分赴各县检查运动情况。不少县和人民公社都召开了除五害誓师大会。
    射阳县采用了边发动、边组织、边行动的办法，层层召开了广播会，电话会，布置卫生工作。县里抽调了部分医药卫生工作人员和群众一起搞卫生突击工作。几天来，全县已有九万多人投入了运动，据三个公社的统计三天中即捕鼠二千九百九十八只，捉雀二千八百二十只、积聚垃圾二十多万担。这个县的很多生产大队都在结合卫生大搞积肥，如光明公社几个生产队结合卫生工作二、三天就积肥一万六千二百多担。很多社员在卫生运动中都进行家具大搬家，做到窗明几净，气象一新。丹阳县最近发动全县人民捕雀，一天半的时间就捕捉麻雀一万一千多只，灭鼠二千一百多只。扬州专区各县都紧密结合冬季深翻地，大搞冬季灭螺工作。
    江苏省委为了加强对运动的领导，最近还组织了一个卫生检查团分赴各地、各人民公社检查各项卫生工作。
