Taiyuan Builds "Missing Link" Industries to Promote Early Completion of Equipment Sets

(Our newspaper Taiyuan, 19th dispatch) Taiyuan City is stepping up the construction of some "missing link" industries essential for manufacturing complete sets of equipment, in order to promote the early completion of equipment sets.

Taiyuan City has strong mechanical manufacturing capabilities. In the mass movement of taking steel as the key and vigorously building metallurgical equipment, more than twenty large and small machinery factories have joined the battle, and in the past two months alone, they have manufactured more than 600 sets of mining, coking, rolling, blast furnace, converter, and other smelting equipment. Among them are huge six-ton converters, blast furnaces of 100 cubic meters or more, and large lifting equipment. However, due to the scarcity of local motor factories and parts factories, even if this equipment is manufactured, it cannot be assembled into complete sets. For example, the blast furnace body, rolling mill, and overhead crane have been manufactured, but they cannot be assembled due to the lack of electric motors, control equipment, and instruments. Sometimes the main parts of the equipment are manufactured, but they cannot be used for production due to the lack of some essential parts.

In order to expedite the completion of production equipment sets, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant business departments, in addition to mobilizing all factories and enterprises in the city for extensive cooperation, have also adopted two methods to strengthen the weak links in equipment support: organizing existing machinery factories to increase the production of electrical equipment and building some new electrical factories and parts factories. Jinxi Machine Factory, Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, and Fenxi Machine Factory, which have better casting and processing technology conditions, used to produce only large and precision machine tools. Now these factories have separately trial-produced 100-horsepower motors, 1,500-horsepower steam turbines, and power generation boilers. This year, they will produce动力 and control equipment needed for metallurgical equipment in batches, and they will be able to equip some small and medium-sized steel plants in the first half of the year. Taiyuan Gongjian Iron Factory used to only produce boilers for heating and general industrial use, but now it can produce large high-pressure power generation boilers by adding some equipment. In order to supply parts, Xinguang Iron Factory has been converted to specialize in the production of various parts and screws for supporting equipment. In addition, new factories such as Taiyuan Motor Factory, Electrical Instrument Factory, Electrical Switch Factory, Transformer Factory, and Insulation Material Factory are also accelerating their construction speed.

Taiyuan City's construction of these "missing link" industries mainly adopts the method of "the hen laying eggs," with large factories leading small factories. For example, Taiyuan Rolling Bearing Factory can currently only produce general small bearings. With the help of fraternal factories such as May 1st Machine Factory and First Machine Tool Factory, by slightly increasing a few special machine tools, it will be able to produce precision bearings needed for blowers and motors.

### 太原建设“缺门”工业  促使设备及早成套

    太原建设“缺门”工业
    促使设备及早成套
    本报太原19日电　太原市正在加紧建设一些制造成套设备必不可少的“缺门”工业，来促使设备及早成套。
    太原市机械制造能力是雄厚的。在以钢为纲，大造冶金设备的群众运动中，二十多个大小机器厂一齐上阵，仅最近两个多月就制造成六百多台采矿、焦化、轧钢、高炉、转炉等冶炼设备。其中有庞大的六吨转炉、一百立方公尺以上的高炉和大型起重设备。但是由于当地的电机工厂和配件工厂很少，即使这些设备制造出来，也配不成套。比如，高炉炉体和轧钢机、天车都已制成，因为没有电动机、控制设备和仪表而装配不起来。有时设备的主体配件制造出来了，由于缺少一些必不可少的零件，也不能运用到生产上去。
    中共太原市委和有关业务部门为了让生产设备尽快成套，除发动全市各工厂和企业部门广泛协作外，还采取了组织现有机器厂增加生产电器设备和新建一些电器工厂、配件工厂两种办法，来加强设备配套中的薄弱环节。铸造和加工技术条件较好的晋西机器厂、山西机床厂、汾西机器厂，过去只生产大型精密机床，现在这些厂已分别试制成了一百马力的电动机、一千五百马力汽轮机和发电锅炉。今年要成批生产冶金设备需要的动力和控制设备，上半年就能装备一些中小型钢铁厂。太原工建铁工厂过去只能生产烧暖气和一般工业用的锅炉，现在再增加些设备就能生产大型的高压发电锅炉。为了供应配件，新光铁工厂已改为专门生产配套用的各式各样的零件和螺丝。此外，太原电机厂、电器仪表厂、电器开关厂、变压器厂、绝缘材料厂等新厂也正在加快建设速度。
    太原市建设这些“缺门”工业，主要采取“母鸡下蛋”，大厂带小厂的办法。如太原滚珠轴承厂目前只能生产一般的小型轴承。这个厂在五一机器厂、第一机床厂等兄弟厂的帮助下，稍微增加几部专用机床，就能生产鼓风机、电动机上需要的精密轴承了。
