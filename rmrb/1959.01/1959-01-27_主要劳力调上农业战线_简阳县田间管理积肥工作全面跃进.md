Our newspaper Chengdu, 26th dispatch: Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has made overall plans to arrange labor proportionally, resulting in a new situation of vigorous, down-to-earth, and comprehensive great leap forward.

Jianyang County achieved great development in industry, agriculture, and diversified economy last year, with grain, cotton, and other products more than doubling. In order to strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and to enable industry, agriculture, sideline occupations, and fisheries to grow exponentially, the Jianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principle of highlighting key areas, taking care of all aspects, and achieving a comprehensive great leap forward in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, arranged the county's 500,000 laborers proportionally: 55% for agricultural production, 25% for sideline occupations and diversified economy, and 20% to participate in steelmaking, iron smelting, and commune-run industries. Among the 270,000 strong army engaged in agricultural production, 50% were used for the current field management of wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans, and for the early preparation for spring plowing, while the remaining half were engaged in manure accumulation and water conservancy construction. In terms of diversified economy and industrial production, in addition to a portion participating in the production of the county's steel base to ensure the completion of steel tasks, the remaining labor force was divided into five professional armies, focusing on commune-run industries, animal husbandry, and vegetable production, while also taking care of the development of economic forests and local specialties. All 81 communes in the county organized professional teams and formulated management responsibility systems, making appropriate arrangements based on the specific circumstances of the communes. The Caochi Commune assigned 50% of its labor force to agricultural production, forming professional teams for field management, farmland capital construction, manure accumulation, road construction, water conservancy construction, and deep plowing of winter paddy fields; the remaining labor force participated in commune-run industries, diversified economy, and logistics work. These professional teams all implemented dedicated personnel for specific positions, responsible for contracts and production to the end. For certain urgent tasks or major projects that a single commune was unable to complete, the county also uniformly deployed labor between communes and districts, implementing large-scale collaboration for concentrated efforts. In this way, not only was there someone responsible for everything, but the labor force could also be used flexibly and uniformly, ensuring the realization of a comprehensive leap forward.

Due to the proportional arrangement of the labor force and the responsibility of each person for their tasks, the masses in the county, encouraged by the achievements of last year's great leap forward, quickly launched a high tide of production for the great leap forward. In the fields, everywhere were active production armies; the field management professional teams, composed of more than 200,000 people, had already universally top-dressed more than 700,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed twice, and were now carrying out irrigation and top-dressing for jointing fertilizer, with each mu receiving 10,000 jin of fertilizer and 200 cubic meters of water. In addition to collecting large quantities of natural fertilizer, the manure accumulation professional teams also intensified the production of local chemical fertilizer in thousands of local chemical fertilizer plants in the communes. The 59 plants in the Jiajia District had already produced 490,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer for use in the minor spring and major spring. The county also had 5,000 small local oil presses, which were also working day and night to produce 36 million jin of cottonseed cake fertilizer. The labor army engaged in deep plowing, water conservancy, and basic farmland construction was also braving the severe cold to prepare enthusiastically for spring plowing. More than 400,000 mu of winter paddy fields in the county had now been plowed once, and 110,000 mu had begun to be plowed a second time, in order to apply fertilizer in layers. In terms of water conservancy, the water conservancy professional teams, in addition to building ponds and dams, also paid special attention to the accumulation and utilization of existing stream water. The county implemented segmented interception and damming on 300 streams of all sizes, and used tools such as waterwheels and "Liberation-style" waterwheels to draw water for irrigation. The communes throughout the county are selecting cotton seeds, building earthen greenhouses, and making nutrient cups and pots, preparing conditions for greenhouse seedling raising for 600,000 mu of cotton in advance. At the same time, commune-run industries and diversified economic production have also developed greatly, with diversified economy alone expected to generate more than 3 million yuan in income in January.

    主要劳力调上农业战线
    简阳县田间管理积肥工作全面跃进
    本报成都26日电　四川省简阳县统盘筹划按比例地安排劳动力，出现了轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实、全面大跃进的新局面。
    简阳县去年工农业和多种经济有很大发展，全县粮、棉等增产一倍多。为争取今年更大更全面跃进，使工农副业成倍增长，中共简阳县委根据重点突出，照顾全面，工农林牧副渔全面大跃进的原则，将全县五十万个劳动力按比例进行了安排：以55％进行农业生产，以25％从事副业和多种经济，以20％的劳力参加炼钢、炼铁和社办工业。在农业生产的二十七万大军中，又以50％的劳动力用来进行当前麦子、油菜、蚕豆的田间管理和提前进行春耕生产的各项准备工作，其余半数人力从事积肥和兴修水利等。在多种经济和工业生产方面，除一部分参加全县钢铁基地生产，保证钢铁任务完成外，其余劳动力分成五路专业大军，以社办工业、畜牧、蔬菜生产为重点，同时照顾经济林木和土特产的发展。全县八十一个公社都组织了专业队，制定了管理责任制度，根据公社具体情况，作了恰当的安排。草池公社以50％的劳动力从事农业生产，组成田间管理、农田基本建设、积肥、修筑道路、兴修水利、深耕冬水田等专业队；其余劳动力参加社办工业、多种经济和后勤工作。这些专业队都实行了专人专职分工，包工包产负责到底。一个公社无力完成的某项紧急任务或重大工程，全县还在公社和公社、区和区之间统一调配劳动力，实行大协作进行突击。这样，既能事事有人负责，又能机动灵活统一使用劳动力，保证全面跃进的实现。
    由于劳动力按比例安排，事事有人负责，全县群众在去年大跃进的成绩鼓舞下，迅速掀起大跃进的生产高潮。田野里，到处是活跃的生产大军；由二十多万人组成的田间管理专业队，已把七十多万亩小麦、油菜普遍追施了两次肥料，现正进行浇灌和追施拔节肥，每亩追肥达万斤，灌水二百方。积肥专业队除大量采积自然肥料外，公社成千个土化肥厂也加紧制造土化肥。贾家区五十九个厂已制出土化肥四十九万斤，供小春和大春使用。全县还有五千部小土油榨，也日夜赶制棉籽饼肥三千六百万斤。从事深翻、水利和基本农田建设的劳动大军，也冒着严寒为春耕热烈进行着准备。全县四十多万亩冬水田，现在已普遍犁了一遍，其中十一万亩已开始翻犁第二遍，作到分层施肥。在水利方面，水利专业队除了修建塘堰外，还特别抓紧现有溪水的蓄积和利用。全县在三百条大小溪流上实行分段截流扎堰，并利用筒车、解放式水车等工具引水灌溉。全县各公社正粒选棉种、修筑土温室和制做营养杯、钵，提前给六十万亩棉花准备温室育苗的条件。与此同时，社办工业和多种经济生产，也有了很大发展，单多种经济一项，1月份就可收入三百多万元。（纪希晨、孙跃冬）
