Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 19th: Nanjing No. 7 Middle School launched a teaching quality inspection by teachers to summarize the gains of implementing the Party's education policy this semester.

The teaching quality inspection showed that after vigorously implementing the Party's educational work policy this semester, students have not only undergone tremendous changes in their political and ideological outlook, but also have significantly improved their basic knowledge. In terms of Chinese language learning, the most prominent reflection is the improvement of students' writing ability. This semester, students completed nearly 40,000 compositions inside and outside of class. The content generally praises labor, the Great Leap Forward, or describes personal experiences in participating in work-study programs. The past affectations of students have been reduced. Because students participated in productive labor, their thoughts and feelings have changed, which also deepened their understanding of the texts and improved their ability to analyze and critique works. In many classes, 60% to 70% of students scored 80 or more on Chinese language tests. In mathematics, Class 2 of the third year of senior high school used to be the class with the worst math performance. In the first and second years of senior high school, about 20 students failed each year, accounting for 40% of the class. This time, in a surprise test, 65% scored 90 or more, and the failure rate dropped to only 2%. The teacher in charge of the math course compared the learning situation of senior high school students in solid geometry over the years with the learning situation of this class this semester. He said that after students participated in productive labor, they drew their own diagrams, calculated materials and earthwork, reviewed plane geometry and trigonometry, and cultivated spatial concepts. Therefore, their ability to listen and understand in class, solve problems, and solve practical problems are much stronger than those of previous senior high school students. In previous years, about 50% of the students would make mistakes when doing parallel cross-section exercises, but this year none of them made mistakes. In the past, senior high school classes always focused on cultivating students' spatial concepts in the first semester, but this year everyone understands the three-dimensional graphics at a glance. In physics, chemistry, and other subjects, the knowledge students gained after participating in productive labor is also more complete than in the past. According to a test of the chemistry class of Class 3 of the third year of senior high school, a total of four questions were tested. Two of them belonged to testing basic concepts. All but three or four of the forty-four students in the class answered correctly. These all show that students have learned basic knowledge very well.

This inspection adopted a combination of key and general methods. Teachers were required to inspect the learning quality of students in the classes they taught and make analytical reports. At the same time, the school determined that Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry and six representative classes such as senior high school year three and junior high school year three would be the focus. Inspection methods: (1) Surprise test—the four key subjects were tested with questions set by the school uniformly; (2) The school leaders and teachers invited students to participate in forums; (3) Written survey—focusing on understanding students' views on learning and labor, and their usual learning situation; (4) Individual interviews. In order not to put too much burden on students, it was stipulated that each class should generally only have surprise tests in two subjects.

After the teaching quality inspection, all the teachers in the school believed that they had attended the most vivid lesson. Many teachers said that this inspection was both a political study and a professional study; it not only solved ideological problems, but also solved specific work problems. Many teachers are prepared to take specific measures to further improve teaching quality in response to the problems discovered in the inspection. (Attached picture)

### 南京七中检查教学质量的结果表明  教育结合劳动　学习成绩提高

    南京七中检查教学质量的结果表明
    教育结合劳动　学习成绩提高
    新华社南京19日电　南京市第七中学为总结本学期贯彻党的教育方针的收获，发动教师进行了一次教学质量检查。
    这次教学质量检查表明，经过本学期大力贯彻党的教育工作方针，学生们不仅政治思想面貌起了巨大变化，而且基础知识也有显著提高。在语文学习方面，最突出的反映在学生的写作能力提高了。本学期学生课内外的习作将近四万篇，内容一般都是歌颂劳动，歌颂大跃进，或记述个人参加勤工俭学的感受，过去那种学生腔减少了。学生由于参加生产劳动思想感情起了变化，也加深了对课文的理解，提高了对作品的分析批判能力。许多班级语文测验时得八十分以上的占到了60％至70％。在数学方面，高三（二）班过去是数学成绩最差的一个班，在高一、高二年级时每年都约有二十人不及格，占全班人数40％；这次进行突击测验，得九十分以上的占65％，不及格的降到了只占2％，担任这班数学课程的老师，将历年来高三学生学习立体几何的情况和这个班本学期的学习情况作了对比。他说，学生们参加生产劳动以后，自己画图、计算材料和土方，复习了平面几何和三角，培养了空间概念，因此课堂听讲接受能力、作题能力和解决实际问题的能力，都比以往高三班学生强得多了。往年作平行截面习题，总要有50％的学生算错，今年就没有一个算错的。以前高三班总要在第一学期着重培养学生的空间概念，今年画出立体图形，大家一看就懂了。在物理、化学等方面，学生参加生产劳动后，获得的知识比过去也更为完整。根据对高三（三）班化学课的测验，共测验了四个题目，两个属于测验基本概念，全班四十四人除了三、四个人以外都答对了。这些都说明，学生的基础知识学得很好。
    这次检查采取了重点和一般相结合的办法。教师们都要检查自己所教班级学生的学习质量，作出有分析的报告。与此同时，学校确定以语文、数学、物理、化学四个学科及高三、初三等六个有代表性的班级为重点。检查方法：（1）突击测验——四门重点学科由学校统一命题；（2）由学校领导方面和教师邀集学生座谈；（3）书面调查——着重了解学生对学习、劳动的看法及平时的学习情况；（4）个别访问。为了不使学生负担过重，又规定每个班级一般只突击测验两门。
    经过教学质量检查，全校教师都认为是上了最生动的一课。许多教师说，这次检查既是政治学习，又是业务学习；既解决思想问题，又解决具体工作问题。许多教师准备针对检查中所发现的问题，采取具体措施，进一步提高教学质量。（附图片）
