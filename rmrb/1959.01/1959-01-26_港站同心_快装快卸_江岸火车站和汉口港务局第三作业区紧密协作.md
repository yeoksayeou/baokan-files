Port and Station Unite: Quick Loading and Unloading
Jiang'an Railway Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port Authority Closely Collaborate

(Our Wuhan Dispatch) Jiang'an Railway Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port Authority broke down the boundaries between railways and ports, vigorously promoted transport collaboration, and greatly improved the loading and unloading efficiency of trains and ships. The dwell time of express freight trains at the station was reduced from 3.56 hours to 1.35 hours, and the time for express freighters in port was reduced from 2.5 days to 0.8 days. The average unloading time for coal per train was shortened from 90 minutes to 28 minutes.

Jiang'an Station is a land-water intermodal transport operation area, with a large volume of goods loaded and unloaded by trains and ships every day, making the relationship between railways and ports very close. During last year's rectification movement, Jiang'an Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port both examined their business ideologies and realized that to achieve a great leap forward in transportation and serve as pioneers, they must overcome departmentalism and vigorously promote collaboration between railways and ports. Workers compared the relationship between railways and ports to two legs, saying that neither leg could leap forward if one was missing. Both sides put forward their guarantees to create loading and unloading conditions for each other. In order to enable the port to know the quantity of arriving vehicles in advance and arrange labor rationally, Jiang'an Station specially assigned personnel to strengthen the pre-reporting work of the number of arriving vehicles. In order to adapt to the railway's transportation requirements, the port actively changed its work schedule and proposed to load and unload as many vehicles as there were.

Both sides also reformed some rules and regulations that hindered collaboration and constrained the improvement of production efficiency, and adopted measures such as unified mobilization of labor and loading and unloading tools, and unified use of railway lines by both sides, to ensure timely loading and unloading of trains and ships. As a result of this great collaboration, the transportation capacity has been greatly improved. Since the vigorous development of the steel industry last year, although the volume of goods in this cargo handling area has surged by 100%, there has been basically no congestion of goods, and trains and ships can depart in a timely manner.

    港站同心　快装快卸
    江岸火车站和汉口港务局第三作业区紧密协作
    本报武汉电　江岸火车站和汉口港务局第三作业区破除铁路和港口的界限，大搞运输协作，大大提高了车船货物的装卸效率，使快速货运列车在站停留时间由三点五六小时压缩到一点三五小时，快速货船在港时间由二点五天压缩到零点八天；卸煤时间每列车平均由九十分钟缩短到二十八分钟。
    江岸车站是水陆货物联运作业区，车船每天要装卸的货物很多，因此铁路和港口的关系十分密切。去年整风运动中，江岸车站和汉口港第三作业区都检查了业务思想，认识到要实现运输工作大跃进，当好先行官，必须克服本位主义，大搞铁路和港口的协作，工人把铁路和港口的关系比做两条腿，他们说缺少哪一条腿都不能跃进。双方为了给对方创造装卸条件，都提出了自己的保证。江岸车站为了使港口能够预先知道车辆到达的数量，合理安排劳动力，专门派人加强了车辆到达数量的预确报工作。港口方面为了适应铁路的运输要求，主动更改了作息时间，提出有多少车，就装卸多少车。
    双方还改革了一些妨碍协作，束缚生产效率提高的规章制度，采取了劳动力和装卸工具统一调动和双方铁路线统一使用等办法，保证车船及时装卸。这样大协作的结果，大大提高了运输能力，去年大办钢铁工业以来，这个货物装卸区的货物虽然激增一倍，但基本上没有发生货物堵塞现象，车船都能及时开出。
