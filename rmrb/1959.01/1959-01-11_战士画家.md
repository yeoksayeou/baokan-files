Soldier Painter
Jiang Wenpin
Look! What a beautiful composition, how expressive the characters are, and how vividly it embodies the theme of "another new record"!

Who is the creator of such a fine painting? Is it a new work by a famous painter?

No! This is not a painting by an expert, it is a painting by a soldier. His name is Zhang Renfu.

Zhang Renfu is twenty-three years old this year. He joined the army in 1956 and is now a senior private. Before liberation, his family was quite poor. He started school at the age of nine, and at eleven, as soon as he could carry a hoe, his grandfather called him down to work in the fields. After liberation, he studied for another two years, graduating from higher primary school. After graduation, he continued to farm.

Zhang Renfu, who loved to draw since childhood, in his first year of school, imitated the way he saw gourds, depicting a cat racing against an airplane, which made the teacher giggle. When he was in higher primary school, his paintings were even more impressive. The second year after graduation, a charcoal painter in Huang County wanted to recruit some students. His classmates encouraged him to go, and his aunts also said that this child was "skillful" and should go to learn. He himself also wanted to go. The elders in his family, under the persuasion of everyone, agreed to let him go and study for a few months. Zhang Renfu studied at this small art research institute for three half-days a week for nine months before coming out.

In 1955, he joined the agricultural cooperative and for the first time used his wisdom to create four paintings, reflecting the enthusiasm and learning life of higher primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, the agricultural cooperative engaging in sideline production, and the militia protecting the autumn harvest. The cooperative members encouraged him to send them to "Serial Pictures."

"Serial Pictures" published two of them in the "Peasants' Paintings" column, and the cooperative members encouraged him to paint more. This peasant son, for the first time, used his pen to paint the affairs of the peasants themselves, reflecting the peasants' yearning for a better life after liberation.

Zhang Renfu's greatest progress in painting came after he joined the army. Because he saw more things, experienced more things, received encouragement from his superiors, help from his comrades, and personal guidance from professional art personnel in the army, and because the army leadership organs convened activist conferences of engineering soldiers or arranged technical innovation exhibitions in Yantai, Jinan, and Beijing, he was allowed to participate and create and paint together with many experienced art personnel in the army, thus gradually enabling this peasant son to grow up. In less than three years, he created more than 930 serial pictures, single paintings, cartoons, and sketches. The biggest feature of his works is "close cooperation with the central task." In the past two years, Zhang Renfu has been in the construction troops. The paintings that appear in his pen depict the labor life of the construction troops, praising the advanced deeds and model figures of the troops. For example: "Come on! Rock, just not afraid of you being hard," "The vanguard of building the motherland's coastal defense," "Breaking the target again," "The plumb bob test was successful," "The moon and stars are close, the People's Liberation Army and the people are heart to heart"... These paintings enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army's high revolutionary heroism, optimism, and the fine tradition of unity between the army and the people, and unity between officers and soldiers.

Zhang Renfu is not only good at painting, but also an all-round excellent pacesetter: He paints so many paintings, not only does it not affect his job, but also, by depicting the deeds of many outstanding figures, he has further improved his class consciousness. He has been commended and rewarded many times since joining the army.

Zhang Renfu, who is eager to learn and make progress, has recently been watching introductions to excellent Soviet works and carefully reading theories related to art creation. He wants to paint more and better paintings for the socialist construction of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    战士画家
    姜文品
    瞧！这幅画构图多美，人物的神态多足，体现“又创新纪录”这个主题多鲜明呵！
    这样的好画，出自何人之手？是哪位名画家的新作？
    不是的！这不是专家的画，这是幅战士的画。他名叫张仁福。
    张仁福今年二十三岁。1956年入伍，现在是个上等兵。解放前，他家挺贫。他九岁上学，十一岁刚能扛上镢头就被爷爷叫下来种地。解放后，又念两年，算是高小毕业了。毕业后，依然种地。
    从小爱画的张仁福，头一年上学，照着葫芦画瓢，描了个猫跟飞机赛跑，就逗的老师咯咯笑。上高小的时候，画的就更带谱。下学第二年，黄县城里有个画炭画的要招几个学生。同学们劝他去，婶子大娘也说这孩子“手巧”该去学，自己也很想进去。家里的老人在众人劝说下，答应叫他去学几个月。张仁福在这个小美术研究社里，一周学三个半天，学了九个月，就出来了。
    1955年他参加了农业社，第一次运用自己的智慧创作了四幅画，反映了高小毕业生参加农业生产后的干劲和学习生活、农业社搞副业生产、民兵保卫秋收的情景。社员们看了鼓励他寄到“连环画报”去。
  “连环画报”在“农民的画”栏里发表了两幅，社员们见了更鼓励他多画。这个农民子弟，第一次用自己的笔画出了农民自己的事，反映了解放后农民对美好生活的向往。
    张仁福的画最大的长进还是入伍以后。由于他看的东西多了，经历的事情广了，首长的鼓励，战友们的帮助，部队的专业美术人员亲自把着手指导，部队领导机关在烟台、济南、北京召开工程兵积极分子大会或
          布置技术革新展览会，都让他参加，和部队许多久经锻炼的美术人员一起创作、绘画，从而，使这个农民子弟逐渐成长起来。不到三年时间，他创造了连环画、单幅画、漫画、速写画等九百三十多幅。他的作品最大的特点是“紧密配合中心任务”。近两年来，张仁福是在施工部队。在他笔下出现的画就是描绘施工部队的劳动生活，表扬部队的先进事迹和模范人物。例如：“来吧！岩石，就是不怕你硬”、“建设祖国海防的尖兵”、“再次突破指标”、“吊锤试验成功了”、“月亮和星星近，解放军和人民心连心”……。这些画都热烈地赞颂了人民解放军的高度革命英雄主义、乐观主义精神，和军民一致、官兵一致的优良传统。
    张仁福不但画画好，而且还是个全面优秀的标兵：他画这么多画，不但没影响本职工作，而且通过描绘许多优秀人物的事迹，更提高了他的阶级觉悟。他入伍后多次受到表扬和奖励。
    好学上进的张仁福，最近经常看介绍苏联的优秀作品，精心的阅读有关美术创作的理论。他要为祖国的社会主义建设画出更多更好的画来。（附图片）
