Experiences in Developing Large-Area High-Yield Movements
Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the large-area high-yield farmland movement in Hebei Province has begun to take shape. Currently, it is being further deepened in close combination with the central tasks of winter production and rectification of people's communes.

Developing the large-area high-yield farmland movement, comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and gradually realizing the policy of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation with less planting and more harvesting is an important experience summarized by the cadres and masses of Hebei Province under the specific leadership and assistance of the Party Central Committee from the agricultural production practice of universal bumper harvests and comprehensive leaps forward last year.

Last year's great leap forward in agricultural production saw old farming habits begin to change: vigorously implementing various yield-increasing measures such as water conservancy, deep plowing, soil improvement, increased fertilization, and pest control, bringing two new situations to agricultural production. First, in terms of agricultural output, villages with less land and more labor gave full play to the yield-increasing role of people, and the growth rate of output generally exceeded that of villages with more land and less labor. In Gaocheng County, where the average land per person was 2.5 mu, the per-mu yield of villages such as Beima Village, Gangshan, Maozhuang, Zhao Village, and Hanxinzhuang, where the average land per person was less than 2 mu, generally exceeded the average per-mu yield of the county by about one time. Villages with land occupancy exceeding the average figure of the county had lower per-mu yields than the county's average. Second, in terms of labor, areas with more land generally had more extensive cultivation in the past. During the Great Leap Forward movement, both digging wells and preparing the land, coupled with deep plowing and increased fertilization, made labor particularly tight. This situation forced cadres and the masses to come up with new ideas. Some of the masses in Ningjin County, where the average land per person was 7 mu, dug machine wells and opened canals on some of the better land, creating conditions for guaranteed harvest despite drought or flood, and then concentrated some of their efforts on processing and fertilizing these lands for key management, thus achieving better harvests. The above two situations show that the production practice of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has improved farmers' understanding, helped them break with old concepts and habits of management and planting, and the new production situation has forced farmers to put forward new requirements for gradually achieving less planting with high yields and more harvests.

Deeply developing the large-area high-yield movement can quickly improve the unit area yield of cultivated land and create preconditions for gradually changing the cultivation system from extensive planting and low yield to less planting and more harvesting. In last year's leap forward movement in agricultural production, the large-area high yield in some advanced areas has provided good examples. In An’guo county last year, the total output of large-area high-yield fields of grain crops reached more than 200 million catties. One mu of high-yield farmland is equivalent to the output of more than three mu of ordinary grain fields. The province plans to cultivate 20 million mu of large-area high-yield fields for grain, cotton, peanuts, sesame and other crops this year. The yield target for these high-yield fields is generally more than double the local average yield. If this experiment is successful, with a few years of effort, the sown area of cultivated land can be gradually reduced, and corresponding land can be planted with trees and pasture, and rivers and lakes can be dug, to achieve a "one-third system" of cultivation.

The initial development of the large-area high-yield movement has shown its role in promoting the overall development of production. Whether in the cotton-producing areas in the south, the low-lying areas in the central region, or the northern regions, methods have been found to solve the grain problem with the "formula" of large-area high-yield. Vigorously developing large-area high-yield fields can also greatly improve labor efficiency. According to several typical surveys, concentrating on planting large-area high-yield fields with the same amount of labor can greatly exceed the yield of ordinary fields planted with an average use of labor. Last year, the labor input in the high-yield peanut field in Hanjiawa, Ding County, increased by 4.3 times compared to ordinary fields, but the yield increased by 49 times; the labor input in the high-yield wheat field increased by 91%, and the yield increased by 231%; the labor input in the high-yield sweet potato field increased by 20 times, and the yield increased by 50 times. The large-area high-yield movement will also cause changes in all aspects of the farming system. To ensure large-area high yields, planting will rapidly move towards regionalization on the basis of communization. With the progress of planting regionalization and the establishment of various large-area high-yield professional teams, the operational division of labor of rural labor will gradually move towards specialization. All these changes will further utilize the land to the fullest and make the best use of talents, adapting to people and local conditions, and greatly improving the unit yield of farmland.

Under the Absolute Leadership of the Party Committee

Developing the large-area high-yield movement is another great revolution in agricultural production. The movement must be placed under the absolute leadership of the Party committee from beginning to end. The so-called absolute leadership of the Party committee requires Party committees at all levels to personally take charge of the large-area high-yield fields from determining plans, measures, and personnel to actual planting actions, from planting to harvesting. At present, Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province are deploying forces, assigning people and land, and strengthening the leadership of the large-area high-yield movement in accordance with this principle. According to statistics from four counties including Cangxian and Yongnian, 54 county party secretaries and members, and 534 commune secretaries and members have been assigned to the fields. According to the statistics of these counties, on average, for every 100,000 mu of large-area high-yield wheat fields, there are five county party committee members, fifty commune party committee members, and one thousand grass-roots branch committee members assigned to the fields to lead the high-yield efforts.

Experience has proven that the large-area high-yield movement develops faster, the high-yield wheat fields are planted better, the management is more timely, and the spring sowing preparation work is carried out faster in places that earnestly implement the above principles. On the contrary, the Party organizations of some counties and communes have not resolutely implemented this principle, and have regarded the large-area high-yield movement as a general task, without personally taking charge and grasping it firmly, and the movement has not been launched in a timely manner.

Must Let Go and Mobilize the Masses

Developing the large-area high-yield movement, changing shallow plowing and rough sowing to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, involves everyone's ideological understanding and affects the entire production process of various crops. Therefore, it is necessary to unify ideological understanding and fully mobilize the masses.

Judging from the situation in Hebei Province, the main ideological obstacle to developing the large-area high-yield movement is still the deeply ingrained ideological influence of the small-scale peasant economy on farmers. In the old society, farmers were unable to invest in processing, so they advocated extensive planting and low yield, saying, "Without thousands of acres of land, it is difficult to harvest ten thousand shi of grain." Now, in developing the large-area high-yield movement, they still have some ideological concerns; at the same time, some of the masses believe that high yields of several thousand catties per mu can only be tested on areas of three mu or five mu, and they do not have the strength to promote it to larger areas. The fundamental method for Hebei and other places to solve these ideological obstacles is to summarize the high-yield experience of the Great Leap Forward, educate the masses with the actual large-area high-yield achievements in the local area, and improve the ideological awareness of the masses.

The key to mobilizing the masses is to first mobilize the cadres. Only when the cadres take the lead actively can they drive the broad masses to actively participate in the movement. The methods used by Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province to mobilize cadres and the masses are roughly as follows. The first is to carry out large-scale publicity. In the early stages of the movement, Hebei Province seized on actual examples such as the high-yield cotton field in Cheng'an County and the high-yield wheat in Anguo County, and used various methods such as meetings, newspapers, periodicals, radio, and exhibitions to carry out continuous publicity. The local county party committees also closely combined the actual local situation and used various organizations to carry out publicity and education among cadres and the masses. In this way, the large-scale planting of large-area high-yield fields quickly formed a momentum. The second is to specifically calculate the accounts in conjunction with summarizing production and formulating plans, telling cadres and the masses about the significant role and significance of large-area high-yield fields in increasing production. Through specific calculations of output, labor, and investment, the masses can realize that large-area high-yield fields are the best way to strive for greater harvests. The third is to conduct a great airing of views, a great debate, and a great discussion. When Henan Dian Commune in She County deployed the large-area high-yield movement, cadres and the masses raised dozens of negative opinions. The Party organization of the commune led the cadres and the masses to hold 23 debates. As a result, not only did they overfulfill the sowing task of high-yield wheat, but they also cultivated a red and expert team for planting high-yield fields.

In developing the large-area high-yield movement, Hebei Province has also paid attention to diverse forms and indicators that are tailored to local conditions and times. At present, the large-area high-yield fields in various places have dozens of forms created by the masses themselves, such as high-yield river terraces, high-yield roads, high-yield slopes, high-yield seas, high-yield depressions, high-yield ditches, high-yield squares, and high-yield paddies. They not only have different names and sizes, but also have high and low output indicators. Some have low and medium targets set within high targets, and some have high targets with low targets outside. Under the direction of large-area high yields, allowing the masses to create according to local conditions will not only not affect the unified plan, but will instead bring new development to the plan.

Need to Establish Professional Teams

The output targets of large-area high-yield fields are high, the number of yield-increasing measures is large, the requirements are high, and many new scientific farming management methods have been promoted in technology, and many agricultural tasks (such as preventing lodging in windy weather) are quite urgent. Therefore, if there is no fixed management professional team and the method of assigning workers temporarily is still implemented, the established production plan will definitely not be completed. According to the actual experience of various places in Hebei, after organizing a professional team, the responsibilities are clear, which can strengthen the sense of responsibility of the members and increase the enthusiasm for production. Because the production management is singularized, many people who were not very skilled in cultivation and management quickly mastered the production technology of high yields after participating in the professional team. From the requirements of cadres and the masses in various places, with the deepening of the large-area high-yield movement, the specialization of daily production management has become a development trend after some concentrated and intensive agricultural tasks (such as deep plowing) are completed.

The high-yield field professional teams in Hebei Province were mostly organized after wheat sowing. Because of different conditions, these professional teams have various organizational forms. One type is that the labor of managing a certain crop (wheat) is completely specialized. This professional team is responsible for all field production management from sowing to harvesting. Some also intercrop construction projects such as opening canals, building roads, and greening large-area high-yield fields, and accumulating fertilizer and making soil fertilizer. Another type is roughly the same in nature, but with fewer people, it has the nature of a key team. The general yield-increasing measures for large-area high-yield fields are managed by these people. When labor is insufficient, the commune and production team will send additional support.

Within the professional team, it is still necessary to establish a responsibility system. In the professional teams in various places in Hebei, the battalions, companies, platoons, and squads are all divided into sections, and the more thorough ones are also assigned to individuals. Various places have promoted "several packages" and "several fixed points," with different names but roughly the same content. From the implemented projects, it is nothing more than fixing personnel, fixing land sections, fixing measures, and fixing quality.

How large is the scale of the large-area high-yield professional team, and how many people should be taken from the total labor force to engage in the professional team is a relatively important issue. If the high-yield field professional team has too few people and insufficient labor, it may not reach the output of the high-yield field. If the high-yield field professional team has too many people and the labor force is too concentrated, it may affect the care of ordinary fields. The number of high-yield field professional teams in various places in Hebei generally accounts for about one-third of the existing agricultural labor force, and each person is responsible for about ten mu of high-yield fields. The high-yield wheat professional team in the Baili Wan Jin Chuan in She County is responsible for an average of 7 mu of high-yield wheat fields per person. The professional team in the large-area high-yield fields in the Yongding River flood area is responsible for 13 mu of wheat fields per person.

Cultivating Red and Expert Teams

To achieve large-area high yields, there must be a group of red and expert activists with advanced ideas and who can master advanced technologies to manage them. Zhang Xiaogou, the captain of the Beiying production team in Gaocheng County, is a member of the Party branch and has been active and responsible in the past. Before this high-yield wheat was sown, the small ridge close planting technical measures were repeatedly conveyed and implemented inside and outside the Party, but during sowing, because his thinking was not clear, he violated the commune's regulations for narrow ridges and narrow rows to sow 40 catties per mu. This example shows that large-area high yields will inevitably cause a sharp struggle in the ideological understanding of the masses. According to surveys in various places, the past views and practices of farmers, except for certain aspects (such as experience in land preparation, sowing, irrigation, and operating technologies), are not adapted to the yield-increasing requirements of high-yield fields. Therefore, to achieve large-area high yields, it is necessary to help farmers reform their old and unreasonable technologies and promote new scientific and technological technologies from ideological understanding to operating technologies. And cultivate a team of activists who are both red and expert for agricultural construction from production practice.

Hebei Province cultivates a team of red and expert activists in the large-area high-yield movement in this way. In the sowing of large-area high-yield wheat fields, constantly select people with leap-forward ideas who can accept and master new technologies to participate in the professional team, and then use the professional team organization to further educate and train them.

In terms of being red, in addition to establishing a regular political and ideological education work system, Party organizations in various places have also selected a group of Party members and League members to go to the professional team as backbones. According to typical surveys, Party members and League members in the activist team generally account for 10%-20% of the total.

In terms of expertise, the following methods are adopted. First, summarize the farming experience of old farmers. Facts have proven that the experience of old farmers is a valuable source that cannot be missed for cultivating expertise. The accuracy of old farmers using seed drills to sow high-yield wheat in Anguo County, in terms of depth, density, and spacing, is amazingly precise. According to the results of random checks by professors from the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the difference between the number of seeds per foot of ridge is only a few seeds. In the activists in various places in Hebei Province, there are old farmers with superb technologies serving as teachers and mentors. Second, promote science and technology to raise practical experience to the level of theory. Third, alternate training that combines learning and production. In this regard, in addition to temporary training for items such as sowing and fertilization, some have also established teaching and training corps, learning while producing, and training in shifts.

Take Corresponding Technical Measures

To plant large-area high-yield fields, you cannot just rely on enthusiasm, you must have corresponding technical measures.

The main content of the technical measures for the large-area high-yield movement is the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management. In the previous stage, Hebei and other places mainly focused on water conservancy, deep plowing, increasing fertilizer, and close planting. In terms of farming technology, various places also tightened the landscaping, changing from large-scale flooding irrigation to small-scale furrow irrigation, and generally promoted several leveling and straightening (such as land leveling, water leveling, ridge straightening, and path straightening, etc.) in well-irrigated land. It is understood that the high-yield wheat that has been planted in various places is generally deeply ploughed about one and a half feet, 50,000 catties of base fertilizer is applied per mu, about 40 catties of seeds are sown, and various close-planting methods are promoted, with a land utilization rate of over 50%.

According to understanding, some people's understanding of the dialectical relationship of the Eight-Point Charter is not very clear at present. Some cadres and the masses in some areas are very impressed with the yield increase through close planting in the management of high-yield wheat fields, and are very skilled in calculating how many plants and grains per mu can achieve the planned output; however, they rarely calculate how much fertilizer of various elements is needed for every thousand catties of wheat on different cultivated land. Therefore, leaders at all levels in Hebei Province are vigorously taking effective measures such as applying additional fertilizer, topdressing fertilizer, and irrigating water on the basis of deep plowing and close planting to strengthen the winter management of wheat fields and ensure the bumper harvest of high-yield fields.

How to specifically apply the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture in large-area high-yield fields is being summarized and technical guidelines are being formulated in Hebei Province. According to the content that has been preliminarily affirmed, one is to select local high-yield crop varieties, and the other is to promote high-yield and effective planting methods. The large-area high-yield fertile land in Hebei Province has selected five crops: local high-yield wheat, millet, multi-spike sorghum, corn, and rice. According to last year's experience, this year, the large-area high-yield cotton fields in Hebei Province plan to be planted using the method of opening ditches and raising ridges, that is, evenly spaced ditches and ridges are opened on half a mu of area in each mu of cultivated land, and the cotton is planted on the soil ridges, allowing the cotton to ventilate and get light from all sides to promote growth and ensure bolls. At present, the province, special districts, counties, and communes are holding meetings to concentrate the high-yield creations and inventions of the masses, summarize experiences, and draft technical operating procedures for various crops in large-area high-yield fields.

The large-area high-yield movement not only causes changes in various aspects such as leadership methods and labor organization, but also requires strengthening its logistics supply work. One of the most important items is fertilizer. According to understanding in various places, the fertilizer plan for large-area high-yield fields (including base fertilizer) is generally above 50,000 catties, and some reach about 100,000 catties, and they are all high-quality fertilizers. According to the planned area of large-area high-yield fields in the province, applying 50,000 to 100,000 catties of fertilizer per mu requires 900 to 1800 billion catties of fertilizer. To solve this problem, the Provincial Party Committee has proposed the requirement of one pig per mu of high-yield field. Many counties have built pig farms in the large-area high-yield fields according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. In She County alone, 98 pig farms were built in the Baili High-Yield Chuan before the freeze. Fertilizer supply stations for large-area high-yield fields are being gradually established in the fields.

One of the most important issues in fertilizer supply is the issue of chemical fertilizer. Large-area high-yield fields require a large-scale promotion of close planting, and it is difficult to apply a large amount of crude fertilizer. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the production of soil fertilizer. At present, Hebei and other places are actively building factories to expand production.

    开展大面积高产运动的经验
    河北省农林厅
    在各级党委的领导下，河北省的大面积高额丰产田运动，已经初具规模地开展起来。目前正紧密地结合着冬季生产和整顿人民公社等中心工作，进一步深入地开展。
    开展大面积高额丰产田运动，全面贯彻
  “农业八字宪法”，逐步实现深耕细作、少种多收的方针，是河北省的干部、群众，在党中央的具体领导帮助下，从去年农业普遍丰收全面跃进的生产实践当中，总结出来的一条重要经验。
    去年农业生产大跃进，农民旧的耕作习惯开始被改变着：开展水利、深翻土地、改良土壤、增施肥料、防害除虫等各种增产措施大力贯彻，给农业生产带来两种新的情况。一、从农产量上看，土地较少劳力较多的村庄，充分发挥了人的增产作用，产量的增长速度，一般都超过了土地较多劳力较少的村庄。藁城县每人平均占有耕地二亩半，但平均每人占有土地不到二亩的北马村、岗山、毛庄、赵庄、韩辛庄等村，亩产量一般都超过全县平均亩产量一倍左右。而耕地占有量超过全县平均数字较多的村庄，亩产量都低于全县的平均产量。二、从劳动力上看，凡是土地较多的地区，过去的耕作一般都比较粗放，在跃进运动中，既打井、又整地，再加上深翻、增肥等加工细作，劳力显得格外紧张。这样，形势就逼迫着干部、群众不得不打新的主意。每人平均七亩地的宁晋县的部分群众，在一些较好的土地上打了机井，开了渠，创造了旱涝保收的条件，就集中一部分力量在这些地里加工加肥，重点管理，于是得到了较好的收成。上述两种情况表明，农业生产大跃进的生产实践，提高了农民的认识，帮助农民打破了经营种植的旧观念旧习惯，新的生产形势迫使农民提出了逐步实现少种高产多收的新要求。
    深入地开展大面积高额丰产运动，可以较快地提高耕地的单位面积产量，为逐步改变广种薄收为少种多收的耕作制度创造前提条件。在去年的农业生产跃进运动中，有些先进地区的大面积丰产，已经提供出很好的例证。安国县去年的粮食作物当中，大面积丰产田的总产量约达两亿多斤。一亩丰产田，即相当三亩多一般粮田的产量。全省今年计划培养粮食、棉花、花生、芝麻等大面积高额丰产田二千万亩。这些高产田产量指标一般都高过当地平均产量一倍以上。这种试验如果获得成功，经过几年努力，即可逐步减少耕地播种面积，以相当的土地种植树木、牧草，开挖河网湖泊，实现“三三制”的耕作制度。
    大面积高额丰产运动的初步开展，已经显示了它对全面发展生产的促进作用。无论南部产棉区、中部低洼地区和北部地区，都找到了用大面积高额丰产“方”来解决粮食问题的方法。大搞大面积高额丰产田，还能大大提高劳动效率。根据若干典型调查，以同等的用工量集中种植大面积丰产田，即能大大超过平均使用力量种植普通田的产量收获。去年定县韩家洼花生丰产田的用工比普通田增加了四点三倍，产量却比普通田增加了四十九倍；小麦丰产田的用工增加了91％，产量增加了231％；丰产甘薯田用工增加二十倍，产量增加了五十倍。大面积高额丰产运动，还将引起耕作制度各个方面的变化。为了确保大面积高额丰产，在公社化的基础上，种植将迅速走向区域化。随着种植区域化的进行，和各种大面积高额丰产专业队的成立，农村劳动力的操作分工，也将逐步走向专业化。所有这些变化，将进一步的作到地尽其用，人尽其才，因人因地制宜，大大提高农田的单位产量。
    在党委的绝对领导下
    开展大面积高额丰产运动，是农业生产上的又一次大革命，运动从始至终，必须置于党委的绝对领导之下。所谓置于党委绝对领导之下，就是要求各级党委，对大面积高额丰产田从确定规划、措施、人员，到实际的种植行动，从种到收，都要亲自下手。目前，河北省各级党委正按照这个原则，部署力量，定人、定地，加强大面积高额丰产运动的领导。据沧县、永年等四县统计，已有五十四名县委书记、委员，五百三十四名公社的书记、委员挂帅到田。根据这些县的统计，平均每十万亩大面积高额丰产麦田，就有五名县委和五十名公社党委委员，一千名基层支部委员到田挂帅，领导丰产。
    经验证明，凡是认真执行上述原则的地方，大面积高额丰产运动开展得就快，丰产麦田种的就较好，管理的也比较及时，春播的备耕工作也开展的较快。相反，有些县和公社的党组织，贯彻这个原则不坚决，把大面积高额丰产运动当成一个一般的任务，没有亲自下手狠狠地抓，运动就没及时地开展起来。
      必须放手发动群众
    开展大面积高额丰产运动，改浅耕、粗种为深耕、细作，涉及到每一个人的思想认识，牵扯到各种作物的整个生产过程，因此必须统一思想认识，充分地发动群众。
    从河北省的情况看，开展大面积高额丰产运动的主要思想障碍，仍然是小农经济对农民根深蒂固的思想影响。农民在旧社会时，无力投资加工，因而主张广种薄收，说“没有千顷地，难打万石粮”。现在开展大面积高额丰产运动，他们仍然有些思想顾虑；同时，也有些群众认为，亩产几千斤的高额丰产，只能在三亩、五亩的面积上作试验，没有力量向更大的面积上来推广。河北各地解决这些思想障碍的根本方法是，总结跃进的丰产经验，以当地的大面积丰产实际教育群众，提高群众的思想觉悟。
    要发动群众，关键在于首先发动干部，只有干部积极带头，才能带动广大群众积极投入运动。河北省各级党组织发动干部群众的方法，大体有以下几种。第一是大张旗鼓的进行宣传。运动开展初期，河北省曾抓住成安县棉花丰产方、安国县的高额丰产麦等实际典型，利用会议、报刊、广播、展览等各种方式，进行连续的宣传。各地县委也紧密结合当地实际情况，利用各种组织，向干部、群众进行宣传教育。这样，大种大面积的高额丰产田，很快就形成了一种声势。第二是结合着总结生产和制定规划，具体算账，告诉干部群众大面积高额丰产田在增产中的重大作用和意义。通过具体计算产量、用工、投资，使群众认识大面积高额丰产田是争取更大丰收的最好办法。第三是大鸣大放大辩论。涉县河南店公社布置大面积高额丰产运动时，干部、群众提出了几十条否定的意见，这个公社党组织领导干部、群众，开了二十三次辩论会，结果不仅超额完成了高额丰产麦的播种任务，并且培养出了一支种植高额丰产田的红专队伍。
    河北省各地开展大面积高额丰产运动时，还注意了形式多种多样，指标因时因地制宜。目前各地大面积高额丰产田有丰产川、丰产路、丰产坡、丰产海、丰产洼、丰产沟、丰产方、丰产畈等几十种群众自己创造的形式。它们不仅名称不一，规格不齐，而且产量指标也有高有低。有的低中套高，有的高外带低。在大面积高额丰产的方向下面，允许群众因地制宜的进行创造，不仅不会影响统一计划，相反使计划有了新的发展。
      需要建立专业队
    大面积高额丰产田的产量指标高，增产措施项目多、要求高，在技术上又推行了许多新的科学的耕作管理方法，而许多农活（如风天防止倒伏等）又有相当大的突击性。因此，如果没有固定管理的专业队，仍然实行大家动手临时派工的方法，肯定不能完成既定的生产计划。根据河北各地的实际经验，组织起专业队后，责任明确，能够加强社员的责任心，提高生产积极性。由于生产管理单一化，许多原来耕作管理不太精熟的人参加专业队后，也很快地掌握了高额丰产的生产技术。从各地的干部、群众的要求来看，随着大面积高额丰产运动的深入开展，在一些集中突击性的农活（如深翻地等）完成后，日常生产管理的专业化，已成为一种发展的趋向。
    河北省的高产田专业队，多是在小麦播种后组织起来的。因为条件不同，这些专业队有多种多样的组织形式。一种是管理某种作物
  （小麦）的劳动，全部专业化，这种专业队，负责从种到收的全部田间生产管理，有的还间作大面积丰产田的开渠、修路、绿化等建设工程和积肥、制土化肥。另一种性质与此大体相同，只是人数少，具有基干队的性质。大面积高产田的一般丰产措施由这些人主管，劳力不够用时，公社和生产队再另外调人支援。
    专业队内部，仍然需要建立责任制。河北各地的专业队中，营连排班都分包地段，作的较彻底的还分配到人。各地推行了“几包”、“几定”，名目不同，内容大体一致。从实行的项目看，不外定人员，定地段，定措施，定质量等。
    大面积高额丰产专业队的规模多大，从总劳力中拿出多少人来搞专业队，是一个比较重要的问题。丰产田专业队人少，劳力不足，可能达不到丰产田的产量。丰产田专业队人过多，劳力太集中，又可能影响对一般田的照顾。河北各地的高产田专业队人数，一般占农业现有劳力的三分之一上下，每个人所负担的丰产田，大约达十亩左右。涉县百里万斤川的丰产麦专业队，每人平均负担七亩高产麦田。永定河泛区大面积高产田的专业队，每人则负担麦田十三亩。培养红专
  队伍
    要想达到大面积的高额丰产，必须有一批具有先进思想，又能掌握先进技术的红专积极分子来经营管理。藁城县北营生产大队长张小狗，是党的支部委员，过去工作积极负责。这次高产麦播种前，党内外曾多次传达贯彻小垅密植技术措施，但在播种时，因为他的思想不通，竟违背公社窄垅窄行每亩播种四十斤的规定。这个例子说明，大面积高额丰产，在群众思想认识中，必定引起一场尖锐的斗争。根据各地调查，过去农民的一套观点和作法，除去某些方面（如整地、播种、灌溉的经验与操作技术等）以外，和高产田的增产要求不相适应。因此，要想实现大面积的高额丰产，必须从思想认识到操作技术，帮助农民改革自己的旧的不合理的技术，推广新的科学技术。并从生产实际中，为农业建设培养起一支又红又专的积极分子队伍。
    河北省在大面积高额丰产运动中是这样培养红专积极分子队伍的。在大面积高额丰产麦田的播种中，不断的选拔既有跃进思想又能接受掌握新技术的人参加专业队，然后再用专业队这个组织，进一步的教育培养他们。
    在红的方面，除建立定期的政治思想教育工作制度外，各地党组织还选派了一批党团员到专业队中去作骨干。根据典型调查，积极分子队伍中的党团员，一般占总数的10％—20％。
    在专的方面，采用了以下的几种培养方法。一、总结老农的耕作经验。事实证明，老农的经验是培养专的不可缺少的一个宝贵来源。安国县老农摇耧播种高产小麦，深浅稀密的准确程度，精确惊人。据省农学院教授抽查的结果，每尺垅的种子，上下只差几粒。河北省各地的积极分子中，都有精湛技术的老农当教员作师傅。二、推广科学技术，把实际经验提高到理论的水平。三、学习和生产相结合的轮流训练。这方面除去播种施肥等项的临时训练外，还有的成立教导团，边生产边学习，轮流训练。
    采取相应的技术措施
    种大面积高额丰产田，不能只凭热情办事，必须有相应的技术措施。
    大面积高额丰产运动技术措施的主要内容，就是水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管农业八字宪法。前一段河北各地主要抓的是水利、深耕、增肥和密植，在耕作技术上各地还抓紧了园田化，改大水漫灌为小畦勤浇，一般井浇地则推行几平几直（如地平、水平、垅直、道直等）。据了解，各地已种的高额丰产小麦，一般都深耕一尺半左右，亩施底肥五万斤，下种四十斤上下，并且推广了各样的密植方法，土地利用率达到50％以上。
    根据了解，目前有些人对八字宪法的辩证关系的认识，还不大明确。有些地区的干部、群众，在对高产麦田的管理上，对密植增产的印象很深刻，计算每亩多少株，多少粒，即能达到计划产量很熟练；但对每千斤小麦在不同耕地上需要多少各种要素的肥料，却很少计算。因此，河北省各级领导正在深耕密植的基础上，大力采取补肥、追肥、灌水等有效措施，加强麦田的越冬管理，保证丰产田丰收。
    大面积高额丰产田怎样具体运用农业八字宪法，河北省正在总结经验，制定技术纲要。根据已经初步肯定的内容看，一条是选择当地高产的作物品种，一条是推广高产有效的种植方法。河北省的大面积高额丰产良田，即选择了当地高产的小麦、谷子、多穗高粱、玉米、水稻等五种作物。根据去年的经验，今年河北省大面积高额丰产棉田，计划用开沟起垅的办法种植，即每亩耕地中，以半亩的面积等距开沟起垅，棉花种在土垅上，让棉花四面通风透光，发棵保铃。目前，省、专、县、社正分别召开会议，集中群众高产的创造发明，总结经验，起草大面积高额丰产田各种作物的技术操作规程。
    大面积高额丰产运动，不仅引起领导方法、劳力组织等各个方面的变化，同时还要求加强它的后勤供应工作。其中最主要的一项是肥料。根据各地了解，大面积高额丰产田的施肥计划
  （包括底肥在内），一般都在五万斤以上，有些达到十万斤左右，并且都是质量较高的肥料。根据全省大面积高额丰产田的计划面积计算，每亩施肥五至十万斤，就需肥料九千至一万八千亿斤。为解决这个问题，省委已提出每亩高额丰产田一口猪的要求。许多县已根据省委的指示，在大面积高额丰产田里修建了养猪场。仅涉县一个县，在封冻前，即在百里丰产川中修建了猪场九十八处。大面积高额丰产田的肥料供应站，正在田野上逐步建立。
    肥料供应中一个很重要的问题是化肥问题。大面积高额丰产田，需要大量推广密植，如果大量追施粗肥，有一定的困难。因此必须增加土化肥的生产。目前，河北各地正在积极建厂扩大生产。
