Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The delegation of the German Democratic Republic government, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, visited the North China Radio Equipment United Factory, Beijing Glass Factory, and the atomic reactor of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences this morning.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Zhao Erlu, and Vice Minister Liu Yin accompanied Prime Minister Grotewohl and some members of the delegation to visit the North China Radio Equipment United Factory.

The North China Radio Equipment United Factory is a basic factory designed and built with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic for the production of various radio equipment. Today, the factory was decorated with red flags and resounding drums and gongs to welcome the distinguished guests. When Prime Minister Grotewohl and some members of the delegation arrived, thunderous applause and firecrackers erupted from the welcoming crowd, and the workers danced lion dances, chanting slogans such as "Long live Sino-German friendship."

During the visit, the factory director, on behalf of all the factory workers, presented the distinguished guests with a new precision instrument recently trial-produced with the help of German experts. After accepting the gift, Prime Minister Grotewohl wrote an inscription in the commemorative album. Prime Minister Grotewohl wrote in his inscription: "Our friendship is based on socialism, and our cooperation will change the world. Together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, we will strive to ensure that labor is carried out in peace not only today, but forever."

After the inscription, Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke to the workers of the factory. He praised the workers of the factory and the German experts for their enthusiastic work and the achievements they had made in their work. He said: The united labor of Chinese workers and German experts is an example of proletarian internationalism. We will always be united in this way and advance on the road of socialism. After his speech, Prime Minister Grotewohl presented the factory with gifts: a small film camera and a projector, and large photographs of a huge chemical factory and a power plant.

In the workshops of the factory, there were welcoming crowds everywhere, and slogans were written everywhere, such as "Welcome to the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic" and "Thank you to the Government of the German Democratic Republic for your help to our country." Prime Minister Grotewohl saw the red characters "Welcome to the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic" written in chalk on a blackboard, and he picked up a red chalk and wrote "Long live socialism" in German on the blackboard.

The distinguished guests visited the factory for an hour. Prime Minister Grotewohl wished the workers greater success in production before leaving. Members of the delegation, including Gerhard Weiss, Deputy Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade of the German Democratic Republic, accompanied by Lin Haiyun, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of our country, visited the Beijing Glass Factory. This factory was designed with the help of the German Democratic Republic. Members of the delegation, including Professor Manfred von Ardenne, a member of the Government Commission for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy of the German Democratic Republic, accompanied by Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, visited the atomic reactor.
