　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet government today sent notes to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France, as well as the governments of other countries that participated in the war against fascist Germany, and the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, presenting them with a draft peace treaty with Germany.

　　In its notes, the Soviet government proposed that a peace conference be held in Warsaw or Prague within two months to study the draft peace treaty with Germany and to draft and sign a mutually agreed treaty.

　　The notes have been forwarded to the governments of the aforementioned countries through their respective embassies in Moscow.

　　The notes pointed out that the signing of a peace treaty with Germany would not only have a significant positive effect on ensuring peace in Europe, but also on resolving the national task of the German people – the unification of Germany.

　　In its notes to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France, the Soviet government also responded to their recent notes to the Soviet government regarding the Berlin issue, and reiterated its hope to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations among the relevant countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Berlin: Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic today, on behalf of the German Democratic Republic, accepted in principle the Soviet proposal for a draft peace treaty with Germany.

　　The Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, P.A. Abrasimov, today delivered to Ulbricht the Soviet government's note to the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the convening of a peace conference within two months to study the peace treaty with Germany, as well as the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany. After listening to the Soviet Ambassador's explanation of the two documents, Ulbricht, in addition to expressing his acceptance in principle of the draft treaty, also welcomed the measures taken by the Soviet government, which are of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe, and expressed his gratitude for the new position of the Soviet Union, which reflects a high degree of respect for the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic.

　　The Press Bureau directly under the Premier commented that the attitude towards the latest Soviet proposal will provide the German people and the people of Europe with a standard to judge who is willing to peacefully resolve the German question and who is pursuing other goals. Now, both Germanys have a greater task than before to move towards reconciliation and understanding.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th dispatch: "Neues Deutschland" said in an editorial today that the West Berlin question is not an isolated issue and must be considered and treated in connection with world peace and the national interests of the German people. The editorial pointed out that this is the main point in the German Democratic Republic's reply to the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the West Berlin issue.

　　Commenting on the notes from Western countries and West Germany to the Soviet Union, the newspaper pointed out that Western countries are attempting to justify their continued occupation of West Berlin with so-called legal arguments. However, Western countries have abandoned their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement. This agreement contains an obligation to the German people, namely, that the occupation of Germany was originally intended to help the German people take the path of peace, but the Western countries are attempting to permanently occupy West Germany in order to make Germany the center for planning atomic warfare.

　　The editorial said that, in contrast, the Potsdam Agreement has been implemented in the German Democratic Republic. This has been acknowledged by many people who cannot be accused of being partial to the German Democratic Republic. For example, the "Times" recently strongly attacked the strong territorial ambitions of the Bonn government and pointed out that the German Democratic Republic had long accepted the borders stipulated for Germany by the Potsdam Agreement.

　　Since the people of the German Democratic Republic have embarked on a new path towards happiness and prosperity, instead of the periodic outbursts of militaristic madness, it has the moral right to protest the abuse of German territory and the German people to achieve anti-peace purposes.

　　The newspaper said that a free Germany must be established that eradicates militarism and gets rid of the politicians of occupation, so that it can move along the path prescribed by the Potsdam Agreement towards a peaceful and happy future.

    苏联政府照会有关各国政府
    建议开会讨论对德和约问题
    民主德国接受苏联建议并表示原则上同意和约草案
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府今天照会美、英、法三国政府和参加反对法西斯德国战争的其他国家的政府以及德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的政府，向它们提出了对德和约草案。
    苏联政府在照会中建议在两个月内在华沙或布拉格举行和平会议，研究对德和约草案并且起草和签订一致同意的条约。
    这项照会已经通过上述各国驻莫斯科大使馆转交这些国家的政府。
    照会指出，签订对德和约不仅对保证欧洲和平，而且对解决德国人民全民族的任务——统一德国都会有很大的积极作用。
    苏联政府在致美、英、法三国政府的照会中还答复了它们不久以前就柏林问题给苏联政府的照会，并且再次表示希望通过有关国家的谈判来解决柏林问题。
    新华社10日讯　据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希今天代表民主德国原则上接受了苏联提出的对德和约草案。
    苏联驻民主德国大使别尔乌辛今天向乌布利希递交了苏联政府致德意志民主共和国政府关于在两个月内召开研究对德和约的和平会议的照会和苏联的对德和约草案。乌布利希在听取了苏联大使关于两个文件的说明以后，除表示原则上接受和约草案以外，还表示欢迎苏联政府采取的对维护欧洲和平具有非常重大意义的措施，并对苏联体现的高度尊重德意志民主共和国主权的这一新的立场表示感谢。
    总理直属新闻局对此发表评论说，对苏联最新建议的态度，将是给德国人民和欧洲各国人民提供一个标准，用来判断谁愿意和平解决德国问题，谁在追逐其它目标。现在，两个德国负有比以前更大的任务向和解和谅解迈进。
    新华社柏林9日电　“新德意志报”今天在一篇社论中说，西柏林问题不是一个孤立的问题，必须同世界和平和德国人民的民族利益联系起来加以考虑和对待。社论指出，这是德意志民主共和国在答复苏联关于西柏林问题的建议而发出的复照中的主要论点。
    这家报纸在评论西方国家以及西德给苏联的照会时指出，西方国家企图用所谓法律论点来为它们继续占领西柏林辩解，但是，西方国家背弃了他们根据波茨坦协定所承担的义务。这个协定包含对德国人民的一个义务，那就是对德国的占领，原是为了帮助德国人民走和平的道路，但是西方国家却企图永久占领西德，以便使德国成为策划原子战争的中心。
    社论说，与此相反，波茨坦协定已在德意志民主共和国贯彻执行。关于这一点，是许多不能被指责为偏袒德意志民主共和国的人都承认的。例如“泰晤士报”最近极力攻击波恩政府的强烈的领土野心，并且指出，德意志民主共和国早就接受了波茨坦协定为德国规定的国界。
    既然德意志民主共和国人民已经走上了通向幸福和繁荣的新道路，而不是走向军国主义疯狂的周期性暴发的道路，因此它就有道义上的权利抗议滥用德国领土和德国人民来达到反和平的目的。
    报纸说，必须建立一个铲除军国主义、摆脱占领政客的自由德国，以使它能够沿着波茨坦协定所规定的道路走向和平和幸福的未来。
