Xinhua News Agency, Dakar, 18th: Representatives from four West African nations—Senegal, French Sudan, Dahomey, and Upper Volta—decided at a meeting in Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, on the 17th to form a federation.

This federation, called "Mali," will remain within the French "Community," and its defense, diplomacy, and finance will still be controlled by France.

"Mali" is the name of a West African empire from six hundred years ago, whose territory once stretched from the Gulf of Guinea to the deserts of Sudan.

According to the draft constitution of the "Mali" Federation agreed upon at the meeting in Dakar, the federation will establish a single federal government, parliament, court, and judicial department.

The constitution declares that the federation remains "open to all autonomous West African states that wish to join the federation." Of the original French West Africa, besides Guinea, which declared its independence on October 2nd of last year, there are also Ivory Coast, Niger, and Mauritania. They did not join this federation.

    西非四国组成“马里”联邦
    国防外交财政权力仍由法国掌握
    新华社18日讯　达喀尔消息：塞内加尔、法属苏丹、达荷美和上沃尔特等四个西非国家的代表17日在法属西非洲的首府达喀尔举行的一次会议上，决定由这四个国家组成一个联邦。
    这个叫做“马里”的联邦将留在法国“共同体”内，它的国防、外交和财政仍将掌握在法国手中。
  “马里”是六百年前西非的一个帝国的名称，它的版图曾经从几内亚湾伸展到苏丹的沙漠。
    根据四国代表在达喀尔的会议上同意的“马里”联邦宪法草案，这个联邦将建立单一的联邦政府、议会、法院和司法部门。
    宪法宣布联邦对“那些希望参加联邦的西非一切自治国家仍然是开放的”。原来的法属西非洲除了几内亚已经在去年10月2日宣布独立外，还有象牙海岸、尼日尔和毛里塔尼亚。它们没有参加这个联邦。
