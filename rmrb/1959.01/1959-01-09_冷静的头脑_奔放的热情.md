    Calmness and enthusiasm seem to be opposites, not easily unified. With passionate enthusiasm, there is less time for careful consideration, making it difficult to remain calm; excessive consideration, even turning into excessive worry, restricts enthusiasm and hinders its release.

    Therefore, we often see contrasting phenomena in reality. Either we work with full enthusiasm, advancing courageously and unstoppably, which is certainly good. However, due to insufficient consideration, we often run too fast and too far. Running too fast and too far carries the risk of detaching from reality and the masses. Or, we are filled with many concerns before action, including objective conditions and rigid rules, thinking back and forth, fearing tigers and wolves, resulting in immobility, stagnation, and the fading of revolutionary brilliance into dullness.

    However, the emergence of this phenomenon is due to the failure to combine a calm mind with passionate enthusiasm. These two appear contradictory but are actually unified. A revolutionary must possess both a calm mind and passionate enthusiasm. He should be a dialectical materialist theorist and analyst, as well as a tireless, continuous revolutionary. Only then can he dare to despise all difficulties while also valuing all specific difficulties, thereby overcoming all difficulties.

    Why are some people able to simultaneously possess a calm mind and passionate enthusiasm, while others cannot? I believe there is no other reason than that the former have grasped the laws of revolutionary development and are able to flexibly apply these laws, thus having full enthusiasm to strive for the beautiful ideals of the future. The latter, on the other hand, understand the laws of revolutionary development only partially, resulting in a lack of confidence, worrying about gains and losses, and vacillating from left to right.

    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Party's Eighth Central Committee pointed out that the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit must be upheld in all work. The communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session pointed out: We must oppose conservatism, break down superstition, advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, exert full effort, and strive for upstream; at the same time, we must earnestly advocate practical, hard, and skillful work, advocate "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures," advocate practical calculation, arrangement, and inspection, oppose exaggeration, and oppose concealing shortcomings.

    This is the spirit of combining a calm mind with passionate enthusiasm. It should be applied in economic work, and in all work.

    From this, it can be seen that we must carefully consider all major links of action in reason, and devote ourselves to action with passionate enthusiasm; we must calmly follow the laws of progress, and enthusiastically use the laws to promote social development; we must neither commit impetuosity, nor be right-leaning and conservative. - This method is the correct method of thought and action that combines a calm mind with passionate enthusiasm.

    Without such a method, we would not have the miracle of doubling steel production in one year; without such a method, we could not complete the earth-shaking, unprecedented great cause of the people's communes; without such a method, we would not be able to achieve new and greater victories.

    冷静的头脑　奔放的热情
    章沛
    冷静与热情似乎是对立物，不容易统一。热情奔放，细心考虑的时候就少，冷静不了；考虑得太多，甚至变成顾虑太多，热情又受拘束，奔放不起来。
    因此，我们就会在现实中看到相反的现象。或则是干事满腔热情，勇往直前，不可阻挡，这当然是好的。但由于想得少，往往跑得太快太远。太快太远，就有脱离现实、脱离群众的危险。或则是在行动面前顾虑很多，既有客观条件，又有清规戒律，思前想后，怕虎怕狼，结果寸步难移，停止了，不前进了，革命的光彩也就褪色了，变成灰溜溜的。
    但是，这种现象的产生，是由于没有把冷静的头脑和奔放的热情结合起来。这两者貌似矛盾，而实际上是统一的。一个革命者必须既有冷静的头脑，又有奔放的热情。他应该是一个辩证唯物主义的理论分析家，同时又是一个不知疲倦的不断革命论者。这样，他才敢于藐视一切困难，又重视一切具体困难，进而克服一切困难。
    为什么有些人能够同时具备有冷静的头脑和奔放的热情，而有些人却不能呢？我以为，没有别的原因，只是由于前者掌握了革命发展的规律，并且能够灵活运用这种规律，因而就有满腔的热情来为未来的美好理想而奋斗。而后者则是片面地理解革命发展的规律，因而信心不足，患得患失，左右摇摆而已。
    党的六中全会指出，在任何工作中必须坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则。六中全会的公报中指出：我们一定要反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游；同时又要认真提倡实干苦干巧干，提倡“十分指标，十二分措施”，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查，反对浮夸，反对隐瞒缺点。
    这是把冷静的头脑和奔放的热情相结合的精神，在经济工作上应该这样，在一切工作上都应该这样。
    由此可见，既要在理智上仔细考虑一切行动上的主要环节，又要以奔放的热情付诸行动；既要冷静地遵循规律前进，又要热情地运用规律来促进社会的发展；既不犯性急病，也绝不右倾保守。——这样的方法，就是冷静的头脑与奔放的热情相结合的思想行动的正确方法。
    没有这样的方法，我们就不会有钢产一年加番的奇迹，没有这样的方法，我们就不能完成人民公社化这样惊天动地的空前伟业；没有这样的方法，我们也就不能取得新的更大的胜利。
