Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: A grand rally will be held in the capital on the morning of the 25th by people from all walks of life to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. The Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast the live proceedings of the rally on the first program starting at 8:45 AM on the 25th. Beijing People's Broadcasting Station and Beijing Television will also broadcast simultaneously.

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today sent telegrams to workers in Cuba and the Congo respectively, supporting their anti-imperialist struggles. In its telegram to the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the United Workers' Central of Cuba, the ACFTU stated: The Chinese working class and all the people wholeheartedly hail the great victory of the Cuban people, fully support the just struggle of the Cuban people to establish an independent and autonomous country, and resolutely condemn any infringement and interference by U.S. imperialism in Cuba's internal affairs. We firmly believe that the Cuban workers and all the people, with their long tradition of struggle, will unite closely, overcome all obstacles, and continue to advance on the road of fighting for independence and freedom, constantly achieving new victories.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the ACFTU, said in a telegram to Congolese workers: It is a matter of course for the Congolese people to oppose colonialism and demand national independence. The 650 million people of China fully support your just demands and struggles. We believe that final victory will belong to the Congolese workers and people.

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to the Federation of Cuban Women for Democracy, supporting the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban people.

The telegram first congratulated the Cuban people on the great victory they had achieved in their struggle for independence and freedom. The telegram stated: Chinese women are deeply concerned and enthusiastically support the struggle of the Cuban people and women for independence and freedom. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Cuban people and Cuban women.

Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: The All-China Youth Federation said in a telegram to the Cuban Socialist Youth League today: "The 120 million young people of China extend warm congratulations to the Cuban youth with great joy, congratulating the victory of the Cuban people."

After sternly condemning the U.S. imperialism's unreasonable interference in Cuba's internal affairs and national democratic revolutionary movement, the telegram said: "We are excited to see the Cuban people and youth resolutely fighting against imperialist interference. The Chinese people and youth know from their own experience that imperialism is fierce and cunning, but with the unity and resolute struggle of the people, any aggression and interference by imperialism can be defeated."

The All-China Youth Federation also sent a telegram today to the Congolese Youth Federation and relayed it to all the young friends of the Congo, warmly supporting their national liberation movement. The telegram stated: "We believe that imperialist rule will inevitably be crushed into powder under the giant hands of the Congolese people. Victory will surely belong to the Congolese people and youth who are fighting for national independence!"

The All-China Students' Federation also sent a telegram today to the Federation of University Students of Cuba, congratulating the victorious development of the Cuban people's national democratic revolutionary movement and supporting their heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist interference.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 24th: Many factories, institutions, schools, hospitals, theater troupes, and shops in Shanghai have held rallies to support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism and to severely condemn the U.S. imperialists' interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonial authorities' crimes of massacring the Congolese people.

The Shanghai workers, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, enthusiastically praised the heroic spirit of the Cuban and Congolese people and expressed their determination to stand firmly on their side and support their national democratic revolutionary movement. The night shift workers of the No. 17 State Cotton Mill held a rally after finishing their shift this morning. Huang Baomei, a national advanced producer and female spinner, said angrily: It is entirely the internal affair of the Cuban people to overthrow the reactionary dictatorial regime in their own country. What reason does U.S. imperialism have to interfere arbitrarily? Sun Weiji, a melter at the No. 1 Steel Plant, said that the people of the world are standing on the side of the Cuban and Congolese people. If the imperialists do not stop this criminal act, they will surely get their heads broken.

The scientists from various research institutes in the Shanghai area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said at the rally that the awakened Cuban and Congolese people cannot be conquered by any violence. Feng Depei, a famous physiologist and deputy director of the Shanghai Branch of the Academy of Sciences, said that U.S. imperialism has always believed that Latin America is under its rule, exploited, and enslaved by it, but today the Cuban people have taken action. In Africa, the Congolese people have also roared. The Cuban and Congolese people's struggle against imperialism powerfully demonstrates that the second half of the twentieth century is the century of the people, and violence cannot intimidate the people who are fighting for independence and freedom. Gao Yisheng, deputy director of the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the imperialists' acts of violence and aggression are increasingly arousing the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. Today, the anti-imperialist anger of the Cuban and Congolese people and the people all over the world will eventually burn imperialism clean. Teachers and students of Shanghai universities and colleges also expressed their infinite concern and support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. The broadcasting stations of many schools constantly broadcast news of the Cuban people's national democratic revolutionary movement, and the campuses were covered with huge slogans and cartoons.

The Shanghai literary and art circles once again angrily used artistic weapons to condemn the imperialists and resolutely support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. Movie actors Zhang Ruifang, Qin Yi, Huang Zongying, and Sun Daolin recited poems they had created themselves against U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and against the Belgian colonial authorities' massacre of the Congolese people at the rally. More than 30 directors and actors also collectively wrote letters to support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. Many Chinese painters created propaganda paintings related to supporting the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people this afternoon.

    新华社上海24日电　上海的许多工厂、机关、学校、医院、剧团、商店纷纷举行集会，支持古巴、刚果人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争，严厉谴责美帝国主义干涉古巴内政和比利时殖民当局屠杀刚果人民的罪恶行为。
    具有光辉的反帝斗争传统的上海工人，热情地赞扬古巴、刚果人民的英雄气概，表示坚决站在他们一边，支持他们的民族民主革命运动。国棉十七厂夜班工人今晨下班后举行了集会。全国先进生产者、细纱女工黄宝妹愤慨地说：古巴人民推翻自己国内的反动独裁政权，这完全是自己的内政问题，美帝国主义凭什么理由横加干涉？上钢一厂化铁炉工人孙维极说，全世界人民都站在古巴、刚果人民一边。帝国主义者再不停止这种罪恶行动，一定会碰得头破血流。
    中国科学院上海地区各研究所的科学家们在集会上说，觉醒了的古巴、刚果人民是任何暴力征服不了的。著名生理学家、科学院上海分院副院长冯德培说，美帝国主义过去始终认为拉丁美洲是在它的统治之下，由它榨取、剥削和奴役的，然而今天古巴人民已行动起来了。在非洲，刚果人民也怒吼起来了。古巴、刚果人民的反对帝国主义的斗争，有力地说明二十世纪的下半世纪是人民的世纪，暴力吓不倒争取独立自由的人民。中国科学院药物研究所副所长高怡生说，帝国主义的暴力和侵略行为，日益引起全世界和平人民的反对，今天古巴和刚果以及全世界人民的反帝国主义的怒火，必将最后把帝国主义烧个干净。上海高等学校师生同样对古巴、刚果人民的反帝斗争表示无限的关怀和支持。许多学校的广播台不断播送古巴人民民族民主革命运动的消息，校园里贴满了巨幅标语和漫画。
    上海文艺界又一次愤怒地以艺术武器斥责帝国主义者，坚决支持古巴、刚果人民的反帝斗争。电影演员张瑞芳、秦怡、黄宗英、孙道临在集会上朗诵了他们自己创作的反对美帝干涉古巴内政和反对比利时殖民当局屠杀刚果人民的诗篇，有三十多位导演、演员还集体写信支援古巴、刚果人民的正义斗争。不少国画家今天下午创作了有关支持古巴、刚果人民反帝斗争的宣传画。
