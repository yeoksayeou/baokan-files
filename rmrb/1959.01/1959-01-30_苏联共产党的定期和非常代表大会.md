    Regular and Extraordinary Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    Question: The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU, which opened on the 27th of this month, why is it an extraordinary congress? What is the difference between an extraordinary congress and a regular congress?
                  Beijing Reader, Li Chun
    Answer: According to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the highest organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the Party Congress. The Congress is divided into two types: regular and extraordinary. Regarding the regular congress, the Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) formulated at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1925 stipulated that it should be convened once a year. The Party Constitution revised successively by the 17th and 18th Congresses of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) held in 1934 and 1939 both stipulated that the regular congress should be convened at least once every three years. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held in 1952 determined that the Party's regular congress should be convened at least once every four years. The Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission are elected at the Party Congress.
    Regarding extraordinary congresses, all previous Party Constitutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulated that they should be convened by the Party Central Committee based on the decision of the Party Central Committee or at the request of more than one-third of all Party members represented by the previous Party Congress.
    The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was convened based on the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on September 5 last year. The agenda of this Congress is to discuss the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965. The Congress will not re-elect the Party's central organs.

    苏联共产党的定期和非常代表大会
    问：本月27日开幕的苏共二十一次非常代表大会，为什么是非常代表大会，非常代表大会与定期代表大会有何不同？
                  北京读者　黎纯
    答：根据苏联共产党章程规定，苏联共产党的最高机关是党的代表大会。代表大会又分为定期的和非常的两种。关于定期代表大会，1925年联共（布）第十四次代表大会制订的全苏联共产党（布尔什维克）党章中规定每年召集一次。1934和1939年举行的联共（布）第十七次和第十八次代表大会先后两次修改的党章中都规定，定期代表大会至少每三年召开一次。1952年举行的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会又确定，党的定期代表大会至少每四年召开一次。在党的代表大会上选举中央委员会和中央检查委员会。
    关于非常代表大会，苏联共产党历次党章都规定，根据党中央委员会的决定或上次党代表大会所代表的全体党员三分之一以上的要求，由党中央委员会召集。
    苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会就是根据去年9月5日苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定而召开的。这次代表大会的议程是讨论1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字。大会将不改选党的中央机构。
