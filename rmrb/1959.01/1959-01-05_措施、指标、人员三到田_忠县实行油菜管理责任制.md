According to Sichuan Daily news, Zhong County, Sichuan, is carrying out continuous oilseed rape field management blitz campaigns with a spirit of continuous revolution. At present, the 40,000 mu of oilseed rape are generally growing well, of which 50% of the oilseed rape seedlings have grown to more than two chi (approx. 2/3 meter) tall. Now, they are taking advantage of the victory to pursue and elevate the inferior seedlings step by step to become first-class seedlings.

Since Zhong County concluded the oilseed rape sowing and transplanting work in mid-October last year, the county party committee immediately took hold of field management, and successively launched work such as thinning seedlings, setting seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing fertilizer, weeding, pest control, and soil consolidation. More than 2,000 oilseed rape technical guidance committees and professional groups have been established at all levels throughout the county, forming a field management army of more than 12,000 people. At the same time, a responsibility system has been established in which measures, targets, and managers are assigned to the fields. In this way, the phenomenon of some oilseed rape fields being unmanaged or poorly managed in the previous period was overcome. Some cooperatives treated all the oilseed rape fields for pests in a few days, and some districts even treated them three times in a row, basically eliminating pests.

Currently entering winter, a movement to protect oilseed rape safely through the winter is being launched throughout the county. (Attached picture)

In the oilseed rape field visited by Chairman Mao in the Hongguang People's Commune, Pixian County, Sichuan, a vermilion "Happiness Field" archway was erected. The commune members are killing insects and weeding in the oilseed rape field.

    措施、指标、人员三到田
    忠县实行油菜管理责任制
    据四川日报消息　四川忠县用不断革命精神连续开展油菜田间管理突击运动。目前四万亩油菜普遍生长良好，其中有50％的油菜苗已长到二尺多高。现在，他们正乘胜追击，使次等苗步步高升成为一类苗。
    忠县自去年10月中旬结束油菜播种移栽工作后，县委立刻把田间管理抓起来，先后展开了匀苗、定苗、补苗、追肥、除草、治虫、培土等工作。全县逐级成立了油菜技术指导委员会和专业小组二千多个，组成了一支一万二千多人的田间管理大军。同时，并建立了措施、指标、管理人三到田的责任制度。这样，就克服了前段时期有些油菜田无人管理或管理得不好的现象。有的社几天中就把全部油菜田治了一次虫，有的区队还连续治了三次，基本上扑灭了虫害。
    目前进入冬季，一个保护油菜安全过冬的运动又在全县展开。（附图片）
