Mass Training of Qualified Preschool Teachers
Zhengzhou Preschool Normal School Teachers and Students Improve Teaching Level Through Practical Work

(Our report) Zhengzhou, Henan – Reporter Chen Jian reports: Zhengzhou Preschool Normal School in Henan Province is using a "snowball" method to train tens of thousands of preschool education personnel for the entire province.

To adapt to the large-scale development of preschool education after the people's communes were established, all of the more than 300 third-year students from this school went to the suburbs of Zhengzhou and the rural areas of various counties to run kindergartens, and also set up short-term training classes for preschool education personnel on the spot, training preschool education personnel for many people's communes. According to statistics from 23 counties in the Luoyang, Xinyang, and Kaifeng special districts and the Zhengzhou suburbs, several hundred kindergartens have been established and more than 12,000 preschool education personnel have been trained.

While the first group of students went to the countryside, the school also transferred more than 300 primary school teachers from various counties to open a two-and-a-half-month short-term preschool teacher training class. In addition to learning some basic principles and professional knowledge of preschool education, the trainees also ran more than 60 kindergartens in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. Currently, the second phase of the training class, with more than 100 students, has also graduated. These trainees will become the backbone of short-term training classes for preschool education personnel in various counties.

The school also runs accelerated training classes for preschool education personnel, training more than 100 preschool education personnel for five counties in the Zhengzhou suburbs. These training classes last only seven days, and the content is all urgently needed in current preschool education. For example, how to arrange a child's daily life, how to teach children to develop hygienic habits, how to teach children to sing, dance, play games, etc. After returning, the trainees taught what they had learned to the nursery workers in the same kindergarten.

In order to help various counties open regular normal school classes, the school also plans to train a preschool normal school teacher with a higher normal school level for each county.

The hundreds of students who went to the countryside, through combining theory with practice, broke through the constraints of some unreasonable preschool education principles, compiled many new preschool teaching materials, and created various kinds of children's toys. Now the school's Party committee is leading teachers and students to compile a set of educational textbooks suitable for rural kindergartens.

Zhengzhou Preschool Normal School has more than 700 students, graduating after three years. In the past, many students had the idea of ​​underestimating preschool work, and some teachers also felt that this work was not glorious. After the students went to the countryside this time, they not only greatly improved their professional level through practical work, but also improved their ideological awareness. They saw that the local Party committees and members attached great importance to their work, and many female members secretly washed their quilts and made shoes for them. The students deeply felt that their work was respected and needed by the members, so they became fond of preschool education. They went deep into all parts of the province and started kindergartens from scratch. Many students served as eight staff members at the same time (cook, nursery worker, cleaner, accountant, etc.), going up the mountains to chop firewood and boil water for the children. Many students were rated as models by the people's communes. Teachers in the school were also educated. They often went deep into suburban kindergartens to provide guidance and absorb new educational methods to supplement their lectures. Recently, the school's Party and Youth League organizations received applications for Party membership from more than 130 teachers and students and applications for Youth League membership from more than 100 students. Many applications stated that they would dedicate their lives to the noble cause of preschool education.

    大量培训合格的保教人员
    郑州幼儿师范学校师生通过实际工作提高教学水平
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省郑州市幼儿师范学校，采用“滚雪球”的办法，为全省培训了数以万计的保教人员。
    为了适应人民公社化后幼儿事业大发展的情况，这个学校三年级三百多个学生，全部到郑州郊区和各县农村办幼儿园，并就地开办保教人员短期训练班，为许多人民公社培训保教人员。据洛阳、信阳、开封三个专区的二十三个县和郑州郊区的统计，已创办了几百个幼儿园，培训一万二千多名保教人员。
    这个学校在第一批学生下乡的同时，还从各县调来三百多名小学教师，开办了为期两个半月的短期幼儿师资训练班。学员除了学习幼儿教育的一些基本原理和业务知识外，还在郑州郊区办了六十多个幼儿园。目前，训练班第二期一百多名学员也已经毕业。这些学员将成为各县保教人员短期训练班的骨干。
    这个学校还开办保教人员速成训练班，为郑州郊区五个县培训了一百多个保教人员。这种训练班学习时间仅七天，学习内容都是当前幼儿教育急需的。如：怎样安排幼儿的一天生活，怎样教幼儿养成卫生习惯，怎样教孩子唱歌、跳舞、游戏等等，学员回去以后，又把自己学到的知识教给同园的保育员。
    为了帮助各县开办正规的师范班，这个学校还准备为每个县培养一名具有高等师范水平的幼儿师范班教师。
    下乡的几百名学生，由于结合实际进行学习，突破了若干不合理的幼儿教育原理的束缚，编写了不少新的幼儿教材，并且创造了各种各样的儿童玩具。现在学校党委正领导教师和学生一起编写一套适合农村幼儿园用的教育课本。
    郑州幼儿师范学校共有七百多个学生，三年毕业。过去许多学生存在着轻视幼儿工作的思想，有的教师也认为这个工作不光荣。这次学生们下乡以后，通过实际工作不仅大大提高了业务水平，而且也提高了思想觉悟。他们看到当地党委和社员对他们的工作十分重视，不少女社员还偷偷地为她们洗被、做鞋。学生们深深感到他们的工作为社员所尊重、所需要，因此对幼儿事业热爱起来。他们深入到全省各地，白手起家创办幼儿园。许多学生一人兼八员（炊事员、保育员、清洁员、会计等），为孩子上山砍柴烧水。有许多学生被人民公社评为模范。在校教师也受到教育，他们经常深入到郊区幼儿园进行辅导，并吸取新的教育方法，补充讲义。最近，学校党团组织接到一百三十多名师生要求入党和一百多名学生要求入团的申请书，许多申请书上写着，他们要把自己的一生都献给崇高的幼儿事业。
