What "Ruler" to Use to Measure?

　　When people talk about the unprecedented bumper wheat harvest of 1958, they always feel a sense of regret, that is, its "先天不足" [innate deficiency], otherwise it would have brought us more grain. This year, many regions have learned from this lesson and paid attention to this issue early in the wheat planting season, doing a lot of work.

　　Is the work that has been done sufficient? Can we say that this year's wheat has "先天足" [sufficient innate conditions]? This depends on what standard of "ruler" is used to measure it. Compared with the autumn sowing and winter management of the previous year, it can be said that there has been progress; if compared with this year's increased production targets, it may still feel insufficient. It is for this reason that Hunan, Jiangxi and other places are organizing forces to carry out a concentrated effort on wheat field management.

　　When measuring the quality of winter crop field work, each region should not forget to use the "ruler" of a greater leap forward.

### 用什么“尺子”量？

    用什么“尺子”量？
    当人们谈起一九五八年小麦空前大丰收的时候，总感到有一件遗憾的事，这就是它的“先天不足”，不然还会给我们带来更多的粮食。今年，许多地区已经记取了这一教训，早从小麦播种的时候就注意了这一问题，做了不少工作。
    已经做的工作是不是很够？可不可以说今年的小麦就是“先天足”呢？这要看用什么标准的“尺子”来衡量。和前一年的秋播和冬季管理比，可以说有进步；如果和今年的增产指标相比，就可能还感不足。正是这个原因，所以湖南江西等地正组织力量，突击小麦田间管理工作。
    每个地区在衡量越冬作物田间工作好坏的时候，不要忘记用更大跃进的“尺子”。
