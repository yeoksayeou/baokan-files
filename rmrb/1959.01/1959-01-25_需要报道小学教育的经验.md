    Need for Reports on Elementary Education Experience

    The People's Daily has published many news items, articles, and introductions to experiences related to education. For example, the article "Several Issues in Implementing the Party's Education Policy" published on page 7 on January 12th was very helpful for us in studying the Party's education policy. This article explained the issues of teaching and labor, theory and practice, and the combination of teachers and students relatively clearly and thoroughly. However, the articles and news you publish mostly introduce the situations of universities, secondary schools, or kindergartens. Articles on some issues in elementary education, especially on how to implement the Party's education policy, reform teaching materials, and improve teaching quality, are published less frequently; recently, there has been almost none. I hope that the People's Daily can increase its coverage and articles in this area.

    Comrade Pang Shumin's opinion is very good, and we will pay attention to organizing reports in this area in the future.

    需要报道小学教育的经验
    人民日报登了许多有关教育工作的消息、论文和经验介绍。像1月12日七版所登的“贯彻党的教育方针中的几个问题”一文，对我们学习党的教育方针很有帮助，这篇文章对教学和劳动、理论和实际、教师和学生结合等问题阐述得比较清楚透彻。但是，你们发表的文章和消息多是介绍高等学校、中等学校或幼儿园的情况，对小学教育中的一些问题，特别是如何贯彻党的教育方针，改革教材，提高教学质量等问题的文章登的较少，最近几乎一篇也没有。希望人民日报能增加这方面的报道和文章。

    庞淑敏同志的意见很好，我们今后要注意组织这方面的报道。
