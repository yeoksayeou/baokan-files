Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 6th. Xinle County, Hebei Province, mobilized the masses to save more than 37,000 tons of coal in two months, ensuring the needs of steel production and the people for cooking and heating.

Since the launch of communization and the mass movement for running industries in Xinle County, there has been a shortage of coal supply. The Xinle County Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a self-reliant approach, mobilizing the masses to conserve coal on the one hand and vigorously produce artificial coal on the other. The County Committee issued instructions, putting forward the slogan of "The whole party and all the people mobilize together, break through the technical barriers of coal burning, and widely promote new stoves, so that black mud can produce flames," and appointed two County Committee members to lead this work.

Xinle County's coal conservation movement focused on two aspects: one was to save coal for cooking in public canteens, and the other was to manufacture artificial coal for heating for commune members. The County Committee mobilized the masses to create the "three-linked blast stove" and the "Longmen Tiger Head Stove" using earthen blowers, and promoted their use in canteens throughout the county. As a result, not only could they burn anthracite coal fines and inferior bituminous coal, freeing up good bituminous coal for steel production, but also, on average, only half a catty of coal per person per day was enough, saving about one catty compared to the past, and cooking was actually faster than before. At the same time, the County Committee mobilized the masses to use "black pit mud" plus some rice husks or sawdust, grass roots and leaves, and a small amount of salt to make artificial coal. Now, more than 130 villages in the county are manufacturing it, and more than 90% of the coal used for winter heating can be replaced by artificial coal.

At a site meeting held last December, the Hebei Provincial Department of Commerce promoted Xinle County's experience in saving coal.

### 改进炉灶　制“人造煤”  新乐县两个月节约煤炭三万多吨

    改进炉灶　制“人造煤”
    新乐县两个月节约煤炭三万多吨
    据新华社天津6日电　河北新乐县发动群众在两个月内节约了三万七千多吨煤炭，保证了钢铁生产和人民群众做饭取暖的需要。
    新乐县在公社化和全民办工业运动开展以来，煤炭供应曾出现紧张现象，中共新乐县委采取自力更生的办法，发动群众一方面节约用煤，一方面大搞人造煤。县委发出指示，提出“全党全民齐动员，大破燃煤技术关，普遍推广新炉灶，要使黑泥起火焰”的号召，并且指定两个县委委员负责领导这项工作。
    新乐县的节约用煤运动抓住了两个方面：一是节约公共食堂的炊事用煤，一是制造人造煤供社员取暖用。县委发动群众，创造“吹风三连灶”和使用土鼓风机的“龙门虎头灶”，在全县食堂中推广使用，结果不仅能烧无烟煤末和次烟煤，腾出好烟煤供钢铁生产用，而且平均每人每天只用半斤煤就够了，比过去节约一斤左右，做饭反而比过去快。县委同时发动群众，用“黑坑泥”加上一些谷糠或锯末、草根树叶，再加少量食盐，制造人造煤。现在全县已有一百三十多个村子制造，冬季取暖用煤90％以上可以用人造煤来代替。
    河北省商业厅在去年12月召开的一次现场会议上，曾经推广新乐县节约用煤的经验。
