Readers Also Need Book Reviews

    After reading the article “Publishing Work Needs Book Review Guidance” on the seventh page of the People’s Daily on the 6th, I feel that not only do publishers need book reviews, but readers need them even more. Recently, the number of book reviews published in newspapers and magazines has been small, with no reviews of many new books, and even fewer reviews of new editions of old books. As a reader, I very much hope to be guided in my reading through book reviews.

    Perhaps some comrades have concerns about writing book reviews, fearing that they will not be comprehensive or that they will contain errors. Book reviews are indeed not easy to write, but readers do not necessarily accept the content of the book entirely based on the book review as a standard, and can still think independently. Book reviews only provide some inspiring guidance. Moreover, if there are differences of opinion, a correct and unified understanding can still be reached through debate, which is also a great thing.

    I suggest that the People’s Daily and other newspapers and magazines publish more book reviews.

    读者也需要书评
    看了人民日报6日第七版的“出版工作需要书评指导”之后，我感到不仅出版工作者需要书评，读者更需要书评。近来报刊发表的书评数量少，对许多新书没有任何评论，对新版的旧书更少评论。作为读者，很希望通过书评来指导阅读。
    也许有些同志对写书评有顾虑，怕不全面，怕有错误。书评的确不大好写，但是读者并不一定完全以书评为标准来接受书中内容，仍可独立思考，书评只给一些启发性的指导。况且，如果意见有分歧，仍可通过争论达到正确的统一的认识，这也是一大好事。
    建议人民日报及其他报刊多登一些书评。
