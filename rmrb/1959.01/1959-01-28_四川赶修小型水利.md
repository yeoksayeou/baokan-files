Sichuan Hastens to Repair Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects

    (Our Dispatch) In order to maximize the role of winter water conservancy repairs in this year's agricultural production, water conservancy construction in various parts of Sichuan Province has first focused its efforts on large-scale high-yield fields, and has undertaken a large number of small-scale projects that require little effort but provide immediate benefits. These small-scale projects are mainly various small reservoirs, weirs, ponds and canals, which have the advantage of "immediate results" and quick returns.

    In order to accelerate the progress of the projects, various regions have launched a high-efficiency movement centered on improving tools, and have also improved labor organization.

    四川赶修小型水利
    本报讯　为了使冬修水利在今年农业生产上发挥最大作用，四川省各地水利建设首先围绕大面积高产田布置力量，举办了大量费力不大而马上受益的小型工程。这些小型工程主要是各种小的水库、堰塘和渠道，具有“吹糠见米”，见效很快的优点。
    为了加速工程进度，各地开展了以改良工具为中心的高工效运动，还改进了劳动组织。
