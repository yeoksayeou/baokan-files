Great Achievements, Magnificent Prospects

The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic is flourishing. The German people are striving to fulfill the battle mission proposed by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany at its Fifth Congress last July: "Fight for 1,200 days, that is, by the end of 1961, to surpass West Germany in per capita consumption of all major necessities and consumer goods" (see chart). The completion of this battle mission will mean that the economic development of the German Democratic Republic will greatly exceed that of West Germany, whose economic foundation was originally stronger.

Currently, in terms of industrial consumer goods, the German Democratic Republic has surpassed West Germany in terms of technical level and product quality. In terms of per capita consumption of food and heavy industrial products, the German Democratic Republic has also caught up with and surpassed West Germany in many respects.

The industrial development prospects of the German Democratic Republic are exciting. By the end of the third Five-Year Plan (1960-1965), total industrial production will double that of 1957. Currently, the output of the chemical industry in the German Democratic Republic ranks second in the world in terms of per capita output, second only to the United States; in terms of absolute output, it ranks seventh in the world. During the third Five-Year Plan, the chemical industry is the focus of development. During this period, investment in the chemical industry will be about 9 billion marks, which is two and a half times the investment in the current Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The total output of the chemical industry will increase by 64% compared to 1960, of which the output of the plastics industry will increase by 50%, the output of man-made fiber will increase by 360%. At that time, the output of plastics and man-made fibers will reach the world level.

In addition, two of the most modern power plants will be built in the southern suburbs of Berlin, which will be the world's largest power plants fueled by brown coal. At least 700,000 housing units will be built by 1965. (Attached picture)

    伟大的成就  壮丽的前景
    德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设正在蓬勃发展。德国人民正在为完成去年7月德国统一社会党在第五次代表大会上提出的“奋战一千二百天，即1961年底在所有主要生活资料和消费品的每人平均消费量方面超过西德”的战斗任务（见图表）而奋斗。这一战斗任务的完成，将意味着民主德国的经济发展大大超过了经济基础本来比较雄厚的西德。
    目前，在工业消费品方面就技术水平和产品质量而言，民主德国已超过了西德。就是按人口平均计算的食品和重工业品的消费量方面，民主德国在许多方面也赶上和超过了西德。
                  （见图表）
    民主德国的工业发展前景是令人兴奋的。在第三个五年计划（1960—1965年）结束时，工业总生产将比1957年增加一倍。目前民主德国的化学工业产量按人口计算在世界上居第二位，仅次于美国；按绝对产量计算，占世界第七位。在第三个五年计划期间，化学工业是发展的重点。在这个期间，在化学工业方面的投资约九十亿马克，这个数目是现在五年计划（1956—1960年）投资的两倍半。化学工业总产量将比1960年提高64％，其中塑料工业的产量将提高一倍半，人造纤维产量将提高一倍半，人造纤维产量将提高三点六倍。这时，塑料和人造纤维的产量将达到世界水平。
    另外，在柏林南郊还将兴建两座最现代化的发电厂，它们将是世界上规模最大的用褐煤作燃料的发电厂。到1965年至少要建造住宅七十万套。（附图片）
