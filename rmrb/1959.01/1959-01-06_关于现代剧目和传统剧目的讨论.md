Editor's Note

    In 1958, driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, opera work also took a big step forward, especially in the area of depicting modern life, where the opera community achieved great results. However, some shortcomings also arose, such as one-sided pursuit of quantity and neglect of traditional repertoire. How to further improve opera repertoire with modern themes, and how to better inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of Chinese opera art are issues of concern to everyone in the opera community. On December 10th and 23rd of last year, we published articles by comrades Mei Lanfang and Cao Yu, respectively, expressing their opinions on the above issues from different perspectives. Today, we are publishing articles by comrades Zhang Geng and Yi Bing to further explore these issues. We hope that comrades in the opera community will continue to participate in the discussion, and especially hope that actors with rich artistic practice will express their opinions.

    关于现代剧目和传统剧目的讨论
    1958年里，在工农业生产大跃进的带动下，戏曲工作也大大地向前迈了一步，特别是在表现现代生活方面，戏曲界创造了很大的成绩。但同时也产生了一些缺点，比如片面追求数量，忽视传统剧目等。如何进一步提高现代题材的戏曲剧目，如何更好地继承和发扬我国戏曲艺术的优秀传统，正是目前戏曲界大家关心的问题。去年十二月十日、二十三日我们分别发表了梅兰芳、曹禺等同志的文章，从不同的角度对以上问题发表了意见。今天，我们又发表了张庚、伊兵两位同志的文章，对这些问题作进一步的探讨。我们希望戏曲界同志继续参加讨论，特别希望有丰富的艺术实践的演员们发表意见。
