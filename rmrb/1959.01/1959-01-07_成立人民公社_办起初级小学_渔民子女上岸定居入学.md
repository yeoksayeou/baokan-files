    Establishing People's Communes and Setting Up Elementary Schools
    Fishermen's Children Settle Ashore and Enroll in School
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Yuye (Fishing Industry) Brigade of the Jiujiang People's Commune in the suburbs of Wuhu City, Anhui Province, has established elementary schools and kindergartens for the children of fishermen, enabling the offspring of boat-dwelling fishermen, who have been illiterate for generations, to settle ashore and enroll in school, further aiding the development of fisheries production. Currently, over eighty fishermen's children have settled ashore to attend school, and forty children have entered kindergarten.
    The fishermen of the Jiujiang Commune reside on boats year-round. Due to their nomadic aquatic lifestyle, the issue of their children's schooling had remained unresolved in the past. Last year, with the establishment of the People's Commune, the Party organization within the commune, in order to ensure that fishermen's children receive education, first established a primary school according to the fishermen's demands. After the school building was completed, fishermen eagerly sent their children to enroll. On the day of registration, fisherman Cao Youcai personally used his small boat to transport his two children, along with the children and luggage of other team members, to the school. Many elderly fishermen said with emotion, "We never imagined that the descendants of us 'fishing vagrants,' who have been blind to the world for generations, would be able to go ashore and study today."
    In order to further liberate the female labor force of the fishermen and enable young children to live a stable life on land, the commune established a kindergarten within the elementary school last November. The commune assigned two elderly women and a young childcare worker to specifically care for the children. The Municipal Education Bureau dispatched a specialist to guide the work of the kindergarten.
    The establishment of elementary schools and kindergartens for fishermen's children not only ensures that fishermen's children receive education but also promotes fisheries production. In the past, whenever there was wind or rain, fishermen with children would be busy taking care of their children, and some often forgot to lower the sail, leading to dangerous situations. Now, young and middle-aged male and female fishermen can concentrate on production with peace of mind.

### 成立人民公社　办起初级小学  渔民子女上岸定居入学

    成立人民公社　办起初级小学
    渔民子女上岸定居入学
    据新华社讯  安徽芜湖市郊区鸠江人民公社渔业大队办起了渔民子弟小学和幼儿园，使祖祖辈辈是文盲的船居渔民的子弟上岸入学，也进一步帮助了渔业生产的发展。现在，上岸入学的渔民子弟已有八十多人，入幼儿园的儿童有四十人。
    鸠江公社的渔民常年居住在船上。由于他们过着不定居的水上生活，过去子女入学问题一直没有解决。去年人民公社成立了，公社里党组织为了使渔民子弟受到教育，根据渔民的要求首先办起了一所初级小学。校舍建成后，渔民们纷纷送孩子报名入学。在报名那天，渔民曹有才用小船亲自把他的两个孩子和别的队员的子弟及行李送到学校。许多老年渔民感动地说：“真没想到我们祖祖辈辈都是睁眼瞎的
  ‘渔花子’的子孙，今天也能上岸读书了。”
    公社为了进一步解放渔民妇女劳动力，使幼年儿童也能在陆地上过着安定的生活，去年11月份又在小学内设立了一所幼儿园。公社抽调两个老大娘和一个年轻的保育员，专门带领孩子。市教育局派了专人来指导幼儿园的工作。
    渔民子弟小学和幼儿园的建立，不仅使渔民子弟受到教育，而且也推动了渔业生产。过去，每逢刮风下雨，有孩子的渔民就忙着照顾小孩，有的常常为了抱小孩忘了拉风篷而发生危险的。现在青壮年男女渔民都可以安心地生产了。
