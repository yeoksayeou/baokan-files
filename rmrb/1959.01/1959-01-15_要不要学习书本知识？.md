Should We Study Book Knowledge?
Bai Sheng

For students, the question of whether or not to study book knowledge should not even be a question. What else would students do if not study? People are not born knowing everything; of course, they must learn. The question is what to learn and how to learn. Illiterate people need to learn to read; those who know more need to learn more deeply. For example, university students need to study theory. The reasoning seems obvious, and it seems like there shouldn't be any problems. There is also another kind of learning, which is to train in labor and gain perceptual knowledge through practice. Last year, most universities and colleges across the country implemented the policy of combining education with labor, and the results were brilliant. Of course, the significance of the policy of combining education with productive labor is far more profound than merely acquiring some perceptual knowledge. Currently, some people have not deeply understood the significance of participating in productive labor. However, some students have the misunderstanding that since labor is also learning, and theory arises from labor practice, it is not very important to study book knowledge today as long as we labor hard. Some students even cite "native experts" as examples, saying:

"Look, didn't native experts become experts without reading much?"

In the past, due to limited conditions, native experts were subjected to cultural oppression and lacked the opportunity to study book knowledge. Therefore, they could only rely on their extremely rich practical experience to explore and solve practical problems. If they had theoretical knowledge from books, coupled with experience in production practice, their inventions and creations would be far more numerous and of higher quality, and their talents would be even more radiant. Therefore, the Party is now making every effort to improve them in this regard. In order to study book theoretical knowledge, they do not relax this pursuit, no matter how difficult their own conditions are. They spare no effort. They compare their cultural level to a large mountain and use tireless struggle to conquer it, aiming to truly become someone who has both practical experience and book theoretical knowledge. Now, some students studying at school have the best conditions to learn knowledge from books. Why not study diligently? The Party has always wanted young people to study more, but it does not want them to be people who only have book knowledge, people who are "sharp-tongued, thick-skinned, and empty-bellied," but rather to simultaneously learn practical knowledge and develop healthily and comprehensively. Didn't Comrade Mao Zedong say long ago: "There are two kinds of incomplete knowledge, one is ready-made knowledge from books, and the other is knowledge that is biased towards perceptual and local. Both of these have one-sidedness. Only by combining the two can good and relatively complete knowledge be produced." In the past, university students only studied books and did not participate in labor. As a result, theory was completely divorced from reality. After participating in productive labor, they gained perceptual knowledge through labor practice, and theory was connected to reality, becoming comprehensive and living knowledge. Our schools are precisely to cultivate such students in order to meet the needs of our national construction. Therefore, if someone misunderstands that as long as they labor, they don't need to read, then they cannot obtain comprehensive knowledge, and this also does not meet the requirements of our country.

The relationship between learning and labor, in a sense, is the relationship between theory and practice. However, the two cannot be simply equated. Theory comes from practice, but it is not equal to practice. The two are a dialectical relationship of unity of opposites. Practice is like the root of a tree, and theoretical knowledge is like the trunk of a tree. A root without a trunk cannot become a tree; a tree without a root cannot grow. Only a tree with both roots and a trunk can have large branches and lush leaves, growing delicious fruits. Therefore, in dealing with the relationship between studying book knowledge and labor practice, neither can be neglected. Of course, some book knowledge is truly useful, and some is completely useless at present. Good indirect knowledge should always be learned. If a person relies solely on their own experiments, there will be many things they will not know.

In order to cultivate students into people who have both theoretical knowledge and can solve practical problems, they must both learn from labor practice and attach importance to the study of book theoretical knowledge in school. Especially existing institutions of higher education bear the task of raising standards. The quality of students' theoretical learning must be continuously improved. Therefore, the issue in institutions of higher education is not whether or not to study book knowledge, but rather to combine practice and productive labor and strive to learn book knowledge thoroughly and deeply.

    要不要学习书本知识？
    柏生
    对于学生来说，要不要学习书本知识的问题，应该是不成问题的，学生不读书，干什么呢？人非生而知之，当然要学，问题是学什么，怎样学。不识字的人要扫盲；懂得多一些的人，就要学得深一些。比如高等学校的学生，就要学理论。道理看起来很明显，好像不会发生什么问题似的。还有另外一种学习，就是到劳动中去锻炼，到实际中去取得感性知识。去年一年，全国大、中学校大多数执行了教育和劳动相结合的方针，成果辉煌。当然，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，其意义比之学得一些感性知识要深远得多。现在，还有一些人没有深刻理解到参加生产劳动的意义，但是，也有一些学生有这样的误解，认为反正劳动也是学习，理论还是由劳动实践中产生出来的，因此，今天只要好好劳动，学习不学习书本知识并不十分重要。有的学生还举出土专家为例说：
  “看，土专家不是也没有读多少书，也成为专家了吗？”
    土专家过去由于条件的限制，受着文化压迫，缺乏学习书本知识的机会，所以他们只能依靠自己的非常丰富的实践经验，摸索着去解决实际问题。如果他们有了书本理论知识，再加上生产实践的经验，那他们的创造发明在数量上质量上都会远不止此，他们的才华将更加焕发。因此，今天党在这方面千方百计地提高他们。为了学习书本理论知识，他们不管本身条件怎么困难，也不放松这个追求。千辛万苦，在所不惜。他们把文化水平比作大山，用不懈的斗争去攻占它，目的就是要真正成为一个既有实践经验又有书本理论知识的人。现在，一些在学校读书的学生，有着最好的条件去学习书本上的知识，为什么不去认真学习呢？党从来就是要青年多学习，只是不要做一个仅有书本知识的人，不要做一个“嘴尖皮厚腹内空”的人，而是要同时学习实践知识，要健康地全面地发展。毛泽东同志不是早就说过了么：“有两种不完全的知识，一种是现成书本上的知识，一种是偏于感性和局部的知识，这二者都有片面性。只有使二者互相结合，才会产生好的比较完全的知识。”过去的大学生，由于只读书，不参加劳动，学的结果，理论完全脱离了实际。参加生产劳动以后，通过劳动实践，获得了感性知识，理论联系了实际，就成为全面的活的知识了。我们的学校正是要培养这样的学生，以便适应我们国家建设的需要。因此，如果有人误解为只要劳动，不要读书，那么，也同样不能获得全面的知识，这也同样不符合我们国家的要求。
    学习与劳动的关系，在某种意义上说，就是理论与实践的关系。但是，二者又不可简单地画等号。理论来自实际，但不等于实际，二者是矛盾统一的辩证关系，实践好比是树根，理论知识好比树身。有根没有树身不能成为树；有树没有根，树就长不起来。只有有根又有树身的树，才能枝大叶肥，生长出鲜美的果实。因此，在对待学习书本知识和劳动实践的关系上是不能偏废的。当然书本知识有真正有用的，也有在现在是完全无用的。好的间接的知识，永远是要学习的，一个人什么都靠自己试验才算数，那就会有很多事情都是不知道的。
    为了把学生培养成为又有理论知识，又能解决实际问题的人，就要让他们在学校里既要从劳动实践中学习，也要重视书本理论知识的学习。尤其现有的高等学校担负着提高的任务，学生的理论学习质量更要不断地提高。因此，在高等学校里不是要不要学习书本知识的问题，而是要结合实践，结合生产劳动，努力把书本知识学透钻深。
