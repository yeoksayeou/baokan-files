　　The Eight Iron Sisters

　　On the iron and steel construction site at the foot of the Helan Mountains, the story of the eight sisters smelting iron is circulating. These eight girls are Li Xiuzhen, Kong Xiufang, Hai Fenglan, Fan Xiuzhen, Zhang Qingxia, Liu Fengying, Liu Shuxia, and Duan Xiufang from Pingluo County. All eight of them requested to come to the iron and steel construction site themselves, and when they first arrived, they worked on crushing ore.

　　After more than a month, their efficiency in crushing ore increased from over 500 jin to over 1,300 jin, earning praise from the ironworks leaders. However, they felt that their contribution to iron and steel production was too small and wanted to work at the iron smelting furnace like the young men.

　　When the young men learned of this idea, they deliberately walked past the girls and said loudly, "Little girls with yellow hair want to smelt iron too? Be careful the iron ash blackens your faces and you start crying."

　　The girls were very unconvinced. Two days later, the ironworks leaders approved their request for the eight girls to build a furnace to try. On the same day, the furnace leader Li Xiuzhen led her seven sisters to dig a pit and build a furnace. When the pit was dug, there were no stones. They wanted to borrow some from the neighbors, but the young men curled their lips and said, "If you're capable, don't let us men help you!" The girls didn't say a word, turned around, and left. They crossed mountains and ridges to carry stones from the mountains several miles away, acting as furnace builders themselves. After the furnace was built, there was no firewood to dry it. They hid from the company commander and climbed up the tall mountains to cut tree branches to bake the furnace. Then, the eight of them carried ore, crushed ore, and loaded materials overnight. In just four days, they built a trumpet furnace and loaded it with ore. After the furnace was loaded, the girls watched the fire and fanned the flames day and night, just like a mother watching her child. Six days later, this small furnace, which could hold more than 4,000 jin of ore, smelted more than 1,000 jin of low-carbon steel for the first time. The subsequent six furnaces all produced low-carbon steel. This news caused a sensation at the Dengkengou Ironworks in Pingluo. The "roll call stage" was covered with red and green congratulatory reports and commendations.

　　Beside the red-hot furnace, the eight girls' will was strengthened. They were not satisfied with the achievements they had already made and wanted to strive for greater achievements. They sang:

　　Clear stream and blue sky,
　　Camping under the Helan Mountains,
　　Although we are peasants,
　　Our hearts will not be satisfied if iron doesn't flow.

专栏：钢铁八姊妹

    钢铁八姊妹
    贺兰山下的钢铁工地上，流传着八姊妹炼铁的故事。这八个姑娘是平罗县的李秀贞、孔秀芳、海凤兰、樊秀珍、张清霞、刘凤英、刘淑霞和段秀芳。她们八个人都是自己要求来到钢铁工地的，刚到工地时做砸矿石的工作。
    一个多月后，她们砸矿石的效率由五百多斤提高到一千三百多斤，得到铁厂领导的表扬。但是她们感到自己对钢铁生产的贡献太少，想同小伙子一样上炼铁炉。
    这个想法让小伙子们知道了，他们故意走在姑娘们身旁大声说：“黄毛丫头也想炼铁，小心铁灰把脸糊黑了哭鼻子。”
    姑娘们听了很不服气。过了两天铁厂领导批准她们八个姑娘建一个炉试试看。当天炉长李秀贞就领着七个姊妹挖坑建炉。坑挖好了没石头，她们想跟邻居们借一些用，但小伙子们撇撇嘴说：“有本事就别让我们男人帮忙！”姑娘们听了二话没说，扭头就走。她们翻山越岭到几里外的大山上背石头，自己充当砌炉工人。炉子砌好后，没有柴禾烘干，她们瞒着连长爬上几丈高的大山砍树枝烘炉子，接着八个人又连夜背矿石、砸矿石和装料。只用了四天工夫，就建好了一座喇叭炉，并且装好矿石。炉子装好后，姑娘们就像妈妈看孩子一样，日夜守在炉边看火煽风。六天以后，这个容纳矿石四千多斤的小炉子，第一次炼出了一千多斤低炭钢。后来连续的六炉，炉炉都是低炭钢。这个消息轰动了平罗大磴沟铁厂。“点将台”上红红绿绿的贺喜报和表扬书贴满了墙壁。
    在红通通的火炉旁，八个姑娘的意志锻炼得更坚强了。她们并不以已经取得的成绩为满足，她们要争取更大的成绩。她们唱道：
    清清的流水蓝蓝的天，
    贺兰山下扎营盘，
    虽然我们是庄稼汉，
    铁水不流心不甘。
