    The Audience Wants Good Plays
    Qin Li
    Recently, when talking about plays, everyone always talks about the Peking Opera "Battle of Red Cliffs" and the Northern Kunqu Opera "Red Glow," just like last year when they talked about "Red Storm" and at the end of the year when they talked about Qin Opera.
    Someone said: Is there some kind of superstition in this?
    I don't think this is superstition. This is a normal situation: the audience wants good plays.
    After working for a day or a week, people always want some cultural entertainment during their rest time. At this time, they naturally have a desire to see good plays and good movies. Although everyone has different preferences and standards, a wonderful play and a deeply moving film will be applauded by everyone. What the masses ask of our professional art troupes is to produce more good works of art.
    Is this in conflict with the masses performing, singing, and entertaining themselves? I don't see any conflict. Even if the level of amateur performances in our factory, commune, organization, school, or military unit reaches a very high level, the audience will never refuse or give up going to see "Red Storm" or "Battle of Red Cliffs." Otherwise, why would our country have so many professional art troupes?
    The cultural departments are vigorously promoting walking on two legs. As a member of the audience, I think this meets the demands of the masses. Of course, I am not underestimating amateur performances at all. Aren't the performances of the revolutionary disabled soldiers in Sichuan and the recent performances of the coal miners also topics that everyone often talks about? This is also because they are not just amateur performances, but good performances.

    观众要的是好戏
    秦犁
    最近一阵，谈到戏的时候，大家总是要谈京剧的“赤壁之战”，谈北昆的“红霞”，就像去年谈“红色风暴”，年底时候谈秦腔一样。
    有人说：这里头莫非有迷信思想？
    我看这不是迷信。这是正常的情况：观众要的是好戏。
    人们在劳动了一天或一星期之后，到了休息时间，总想文化娱乐一番，这时候，自然产生一种看好戏、好电影的要求。虽然这里面也各有所好，每个人的兴趣、标准也不同，但一出精彩的戏，一部感人至深的影片，那是大家都会叫好的。群众要求于我们的专业艺术团体的，也就是多拿出些好的艺术作品来。
    这同群众自演自唱自己娱乐有没有矛盾呢？我看没有什么矛盾。本厂、本公社、本机关、本学校或本部队的业余演出的水平即使到了十分精彩的地步，观众也决不会拒绝或放弃去看“红色风暴”或“赤壁之战”的。要不，我们国家搞那么多专业艺术团体干什么呢？
    文化部门正在大力提倡两条腿走路，作为一个观众，我以为这是符合群众的要求的。自然，我丝毫没有看轻业余演出的意思，四川革命残废军人的演出，以及最近煤矿工人的演出，不也是大家经常谈论的题目么？这也因为他们不只是业余演出，而且是好的演出。
