Title: The True Face of "Humanitarians"

    The skin of imperialists is the thickest in the world: the American imperialists, who protect the murderers of Cuba, call themselves "humanitarians," and their lackeys, the Belgian colonialists who suck the marrow of the Congolese people, also call themselves "humanitarians." However, what have these self-proclaimed "humanitarians" brought to the Congolese people in the past eighty years? It is that workers work as long as fourteen to sixteen hours a day; it is the increase in the number of unemployed; it is that the population has been reduced by half; it is that the infant mortality rate is as high as 50%! According to statistics, in 1957 alone, the five hundred companies operated by Belgium in the Congo took 10,583 million Belgian francs from the Congolese people. And this is only a part of what they themselves admit.

    For such "humanitarians," the United States, which regards itself as the "defender of Western civilization," boasts that he is an "enlightened colonizer." Birds of a feather flock together. This is understandable. In recent years, the United States has seized more wealth in the Congo than the Belgian colonialists, obtaining a 90% priority in purchasing Congolese uranium and thorium production, controlling 50% of tin mining rights and molybdenum, tungsten, and cadmium mines, and establishing dozens of military airports. Eisenhower once said publicly: "What shall we do without the Congo?" If they do not call his lackeys "enlightened colonizers," how can they explain themselves?

    However, black is always black, white is always white, and it cannot be reversed. The people know, from their own personal feelings, what kind of devils are riding on their backs. They want to break free from the devils riding on their backs and break the shackles that bind them. "Africa is moving!" The American masters are panicked. The "enlightened" Belgian colonialists, despite pretending to "investigate" the "causes" of the Congolese riots, immediately exposed their ferocious faces: mobilizing a large number of troops from the country to the Congo for bloody suppression. And American imperialism—today's greater plunderer of the Congolese people—more eagerly exposed their terrified and ferocious faces, and they are applauding the two-faced policy played by the Belgian government to deceive the Congolese people. In this way, these two hypocritical "humanitarians" all exposed their true colors.

    The brutal exploitation of colonial peoples is one of the most important survival conditions for imperialists. Now, the sleeping African lion has awakened, and it has shaken the cornerstone of imperialism. "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." This is the inevitable trend of the world, and no matter how furiously the imperialists rage, they cannot save their fate of rotting away.

    “人道主义”者的本相
    郁君文
    帝国主义者的脸皮，算得是天下最厚的了：袒护古巴杀人犯的美帝国主义，自封为“人道主义”者，而它的小伙计，吮吸着刚果人民膏血的比利时殖民者，却也自称为“人道主义”者了。然而，这自称为“人道主义”者的比利时殖民者，八十年来带给刚果人民的是什么呢？是工人工作时间长达十四小时到十六小时；是失业人数的增加；是人口减少了一半；是婴儿的死亡率高达50％！据统计，仅在1957年一年中，比利时在刚果进行经营的五百家公司，便从刚果人民身上刮走了一百零五亿八千三百万比利时法郎。这还只是他们自己承认的一部分而已。
    对于这样的“人道主义”者，以“西方文明保卫者”自居的美国，却夸称他为“开明的殖民者”。物以类聚，这也是可以理解的。美国近年来在刚果，夺取了比比利时殖民者更多的财富，获得了购买刚果铀、钍产量的90％的优先权，控制了50％的锡的开采权和钼、钨、镉矿，建立了几十个军用机场。艾森豪威尔就公开地说过：“如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办？”如果他们不封他的小伙计为“开明的殖民者”，又怎么自解呢？
    然而，黑总是黑，白总是白，颠倒不了的。人民以他们切身的感受，知道骑在他们背上的，究竟是什么样的魔鬼。他们要挣脱骑在他们背上的魔鬼，拧断套在他们身上的枷锁。“非洲动起来了！”美国老爷们惊慌了。比利时“开明”的殖民者，尽管装模作样地去“调查”刚果暴动的“原因”，然而也立刻暴露了他们的狰狞面目：从国内调动大批军队到刚果去进行血腥的镇压。而美帝国主义——今天刚果人民更大的剥夺者，更急不可待地暴露了他们既恐惧又狰狞的面目，他们正为比利时政府玩弄的欺骗刚果人民的两面政策喝采。这一来，这两个伪善的“人道主义”者，一齐暴露了他们的本来面目。
    对殖民地人民的野蛮剥削，是帝国主义者最重要的生存条件之一，现在，沉睡的非洲雄狮觉醒了，它动摇了帝国主义的基石。“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”，这是世界必然的趋势，帝国主义者再暴跳如雷，也挽救不了他们烂下去的命运了。
