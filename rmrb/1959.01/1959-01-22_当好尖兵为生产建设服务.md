Serving Production and Construction Well as a Vanguard
*People's Daily* Commentator

In 1958, China's meteorological work, like other undertakings, achieved tremendous development under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and by relying on the entire Party and all the people. The number of meteorological stations and weather (climate) stations increased by 81% compared with 1957. The masses themselves built more than 38,000 meteorological outposts and more than 480,000 weather observation groups. A meteorological service network of "prefecture-level regions with stations, counties with stations, communes with outposts, and teams with weather observation groups" was basically formed across the country. Due to the combination of meteorological science and mass experience, the accuracy rate of weather forecasts increased by an average of more than 10%. The rapid development of meteorological work has played a significant role in ensuring agricultural production.

The task of meteorological work is to fully guarantee the completion of production and construction tasks, especially agricultural production tasks. At present, there is still a large gap between meteorological work and objective needs. Weather forecasts need to be greatly improved, weather control needs to be further explored, and service work cannot fully meet the needs of all parties. Therefore, meteorological work must rely on Party committees at all levels, rely on the broad masses, and adhere to the principles of combining state-run meteorological stations with people-run meteorological outposts, combining scientific technology with mass experience, and combining the forecasts of meteorological stations with the supplementary forecasts of meteorological (climate) stations and outposts. Meteorological stations, outposts, and groups are spread throughout every corner of the motherland, and meteorological services are related to all walks of life and connected to every rural area. The quality of meteorological work largely depends on whether power is delegated and whether the mass line is resolutely implemented. The facts of the past year have proven that in areas where meteorological work has been resolutely and thoroughly delegated and where mass work is better, meteorological work is full of vitality. Conversely, it is cold and stagnant. The achievements of meteorological work last year fully demonstrate the greatness of the power of the masses and the infinite wisdom of the masses. Only by extensively mobilizing the masses to run meteorological undertakings can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results and continuously improve to meet the needs of construction undertakings.

China's meteorological scientific foundation was originally weak. On the one hand, we should combine the characteristics of China's weather and terrain and modestly learn from foreign, especially Soviet, advanced experience. On the other hand, we should also attach importance to exploring China's meteorological scientific heritage, collecting and summarizing mass experience, and applying it to practical work. Practice has proven that the masses have rich meteorological knowledge, and it is all explored from long-term production practice, which is more local and more adaptable to specific production needs. This is precisely the problem that modern meteorological science is still difficult to solve for the time being. The reason why the accuracy rate of supplementary forecasts from meteorological stations and outposts is more than 10% higher than that of meteorological stations is because the large-scale weather situation forecasts of meteorological stations are combined with the local weather characteristics of local areas.

China has already established a dense meteorological service network. However, the establishment of a meteorological service network is only the beginning of the popularization of meteorological work. The key to whether the meteorological service network can be consolidated lies in whether service work can be done well. The same is true for meteorological outposts and groups. At present, there are not many outposts and groups that can do a good job of service. Therefore, grasping the consolidation work is a key issue at present. We should seize the opportunity and immediately impart supplementary forecasting methods and simple agricultural meteorological forecasting methods to all meteorological personnel, especially outpost and group personnel, so as to prepare before the agricultural production season arrives and provide timely services.

With the development of socialist production and construction, the tasks of meteorological work will become increasingly heavy. Meteorological workers should be good at summarizing the experiences of meteorological construction in the past few years, especially last year, and meteorological work will definitely be done better.

    当好尖兵为生产建设服务
    本报评论员
    1958年，我国气象事业和其他事业一样，在党中央正确领导下，依靠了全党全民，获得了巨大的发展。气象台和气象（候）站比1957年增加了81％，群众自建了三万八千多个气象哨，四十八万多个看天小组，在全国范围内，基本上组成了“专区有台、县县有站，社社有哨，队队有看天小组”的气象服务网。由于气象科学与群众经验相结合，天气预报的准确率平均就提高了10％以上。由于气象事业的迅速发展，在保证农业生产方面，发挥了很大的作用。
    气象工作的任务是全力保证生产建设任务特别是农业生产任务的完成。目前气象工作与客观需要还有很大距离，气象预报还需要大力提高，天气控制还有待于进一步摸索，服务工作还不能充分满足各方面的需要。因此，气象工作必须依靠各级党委，依靠广大群众，坚持贯彻国家气象台站和民办气象哨组相结合、科学技术与群众经验相结合以及气象台的预报与气象（候）站、哨的补充预报相结合等方针。气象台、站、哨、组遍布于祖国的各个角落，气象服务关系到各行各业，连系到每一个农村，气象工作的好坏，在很大程度上决定于权力是否下放，是不是坚决地贯彻了群众路线。一年来的事实证明：凡是气象工作下放坚决彻底的地区，群众工作较好的地区，气象工作就生气勃勃，反之，就冷冷清清，停滞不前。去年气象工作的成就，充分显示出群众力量的伟大，群众智慧的无穷。只有广泛发动群众来办气象事业，才能多、快、好、省，不断提高，适应建设事业的需要。
    我国气象科学基础原较薄弱，我们一方面应该结合我国天气和地形的特点，虚心学习国外、特别是苏联的先进经验，另一方面，也要重视发掘祖国的气象科学遗产，汇集和总结群众经验，运用到实际工作中去，实践证明：群众有丰富的气象知识，而且都是从长期的生产实践中摸索出来的，更具有地方性的特点，更能适应具体的生产需要，而这又恰恰是近代气象科学一时还难以解决的问题。气象站、哨补充预报之所以比气象台预报准确率高出10％以上，就是由于把气象台大范围的天气形势预报与局部地区的地方性天气特点结合起来的结果。
    我国已经建立了星罗棋布的气象服务网，但是，气象服务网的建立不过是气象工作群众化的开始，气象服务网能不能巩固，关键在于能不能做好服务工作。气象哨、组更是如此。现在能够做好服务工作的哨组为数还不多，因此抓紧巩固工作，就是当前一个关键问题。目前应该抓住时机、立即向所有的气象人员，特别是哨、组工作人员，传授补充预报方法和简易的农业气象预报方法，以便在农业生产季节来临之前做好准备，及时进行服务。
    随着社会主义生产建设的发展，气象工作的任务将日益繁重。气象工作人员要善于总结几年来尤其是去年气象建设的经验，气象工作就一定能够办得更好。
