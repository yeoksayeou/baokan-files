Supports the German People's Struggle for the Reunification of their Motherland
The Just Struggles of the Cuban and Congolese People Will Surely Achieve Final Victory with the Support of People All Over the World

Respected Premier, esteemed comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, comrades, friends:

Today, we, the people from all walks of life in the capital, are gathered here with the feeling of old friends reuniting to warmly welcome our close friend, the outstanding statesman of the Chinese people and the German people, Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic. We feel very honored and happy. Please allow me, on behalf of the people of the capital and all the people of China, to express our highest respect to our distinguished guests, and through them, to the fraternal German people.

Three years ago, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, visited our country at the invitation of our government and signed the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with our government, making a significant contribution to consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. This time, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic has once again been invited to visit our country, which will surely further strengthen the fraternal friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

The Chinese people have always held the German nation, which gave birth to the founders of scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, in high esteem. The people of the German Democratic Republic, as the masters of the first worker-peasant state in German history, have inherited and carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the German nation. Now, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, they are working selflessly with full confidence to complete the task of socialist construction in a short period of history. At present, the industrial production growth rate of the German Democratic Republic has exceeded that of all capitalist countries. The total industrial output in 1958 increased by 10.9% compared with 1957, greatly exceeding the original plan. In agriculture, a general bumper harvest of grain was achieved last year, and the output of most agricultural products, calculated per capita, has exceeded that of West Germany. Great progress has also been made in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held in July last year, put forward the task of "exceeding West Germany in the per capita consumption of all major means of livelihood and consumer goods by the end of 1961." This year, the scale of economic construction in the German Democratic Republic will be even more magnificent. The industrial output plan for this year is 11.1% higher than last year, and the socialist transformation of agriculture will also be further developed. The victory of socialist construction in the German Democratic Republic has and will continue to have a profound impact on the whole of Germany and Europe. The stronger the German Democratic Republic, the more guaranteed is peace in Europe. The German Democratic Republic is the foundation of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. It represents the lofty hopes and bright future of all the German people. The path taken by the German Democratic Republic today is also the only correct path for all the German people.

The German Democratic Republic is a strong bulwark for maintaining peace and security in Europe and an important force against the American aggressors launching a new war in Europe. The German Democratic Republic has made unremitting efforts to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys, and to unify its motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis. The German Democratic Republic is increasingly attracting the increasingly broad peace-loving and democratic forces of the whole of Germany, and is playing an increasingly significant role in maintaining peace in Europe and promoting the cause of the German nation's unification into a peace-loving and democratic country. The peaceful foreign policy of the Government of the German Democratic Republic and its active support for the position of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries in maintaining and striving for national independence have been trusted and praised by all peace-loving people in the world. The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, visited some Asian and African countries and received warm welcome and friendly reception from the governments and peoples of these countries. This will undoubtedly further strengthen and expand the friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and these countries. Not long ago, the Soviet government, in line with the lofty aspiration of maintaining peace and promoting the peaceful settlement of the German issue, proposed to withdraw foreign troops from Berlin, end the occupation status of West Berlin, and turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. Recently, the Soviet government put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany and proposed that relevant countries convene a meeting to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. These positive proposals have been welcomed and supported by the German people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. The Chinese people not only fully support these reasonable proposals of the Soviet government, but also support the position of the Government of the German Democratic Republic on striving for the unification of the German nation into a peace-loving and democratic country and resolving the Berlin issue. We firmly believe that the German people's just struggle for the reunification of their motherland in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles will surely achieve final victory.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are making every effort to realize the general line of socialist construction. In the past year, the output of industrial and agricultural products in our country has greatly increased, and the vast rural areas have basically realized communization. This year, the people of our country are continuing to work hard and strive for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959. The achievements of our country's economic construction are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. The Chinese people cherish this fraternal support very much and express their heartfelt gratitude for this fraternal support.

Comrades, friends, the international situation has never been as good for the people of the world who are striving for peace as it is now. We are in a great era in which the East wind has prevailed and will continue to prevail over the West wind. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is thriving, its unity is becoming increasingly consolidated, and its mutual assistance relations are developing day by day. Not long ago, the control figures of the Soviet Union's plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965 was a program for building communism of great significance. It represents the vigorous new atmosphere of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the superiority of the socialist system. The Soviet Union has recently successfully launched the world's first cosmic rocket, once again powerfully proving that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in the latest science and technology. At the same time, the struggle of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries against colonialism and for national independence has also made great progress. The great victory of the Iraqi national revolution has caused the imperialists to suffer a heavy defeat in the Middle East. The Algerian people are waging a heroic national liberation war, and their just struggle has won the widespread sympathy and resolute support of the people of the world. The African continent, which has always been regarded as "stable" by the colonialists, is now roaring. The movement of the people of the Belgian Congo to strive for independence is developing vigorously. The flames of the national liberation movement have spread throughout Africa. At the same time, in Latin America, which was regarded by the American imperialists as their own "backyard," the national democratic movement is also developing vigorously. The Cuban people have overthrown Batista's pro-American traitorous dictatorial government. The American imperialists are trying every means to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. The Cuban people are bravely carrying out a national struggle against American interference. We fully sympathize with and resolutely support the Cuban people, the Congolese people, and all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are struggling for national independence. We firmly believe that with the sympathy and support of the powerful socialist camp and all justice-upholding people and countries in the world, their heroic struggle will surely achieve final victory.

In the face of the flourishing socialist camp and the rising tide of the national liberation movement, the decline of imperialism has become more obvious. Their economic crisis is continuing to deepen and expand, internal contradictions are becoming more acute, and they are heading towards disintegration. Although the imperialists are still making a final death struggle, no force in the world can save them from their demise. The life of imperialism will not be long. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The enemy is decaying day by day, and we are getting better day by day." This is the most fundamental characteristic of our era today.

The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are fraternal countries born in the same year and month. Since their establishment, our two countries have jointly supported each other and advanced side by side under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, on the basis of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, the cooperative relations between our two countries in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects have been fully developed. The Chinese people have consistently received the support and assistance of the people of the German Democratic Republic in the struggle to build socialism and oppose American imperialist aggression. Here, on behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Premier and all the comrades of the delegation, and through you to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. Similarly, we Chinese people also regard supporting the socialist construction of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the just struggle for the reunification of their motherland as our unshirkable responsibility. The Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe. If the imperialist war maniacs dare to invade the German Democratic Republic, then not only will all the countries of our entire socialist camp fully support the German Democratic Republic, but all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world will stand on the side of the German Democratic Republic, and the aggressors will inevitably suffer the consequences.

Comrades, friends, let us shout:

Long live the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and German peoples!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

Long live world peace!

    彭真市长在首都各界人民欢迎德政府代表团大会上讲话
    支持德意志人民为统一祖国而斗争
    古巴、刚果人民的正义斗争在全世界人民支持下必将取得最后胜利敬爱的总理同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里集会，怀着旧友重逢的心情热烈地欢迎中国人民亲密的朋友和德国人民杰出的政治家、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，我们感到非常荣幸和愉快。请允许我以首都人民和全中国人民的名义，向我们的贵宾们，并且通过他们向兄弟的德意志人民表示崇高的敬意。
    三年前，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应我国政府的邀请，曾经访问了我国，并且同我国政府签订了中德友好合作条约，对于巩固和发展我们两国的友好合作关系作出了重大贡献。这次德意志民主共和国政府代表团再次应邀来我国访问，必将进一步加强我们两国之间的兄弟般的友好合作关系。
    中国人民对诞生了科学社会主义的创始人马克思、恩格斯的德意志民族，一向怀着崇高的敬意。德意志民主共和国的人民，作为德国历史上第一个工农国家的主人，继承并且发扬了德意志民族的光荣革命传统。现在他们在德国统一社会党的领导下，正在满怀信心地为在短短的历史时期内完成社会主义建设的任务进行着忘我的劳动。目前德意志民主共和国的工业生产增长速度已经超过了所有的资本主义国家，1958年的工业总产量比1957年增长了10.9％，大大地超过了原订计划。在农业方面，去年谷物获得普遍丰收，大部分农产品的产量按人口平均计算已经超过了西德。在农业社会主义改造方面也获得了巨大的进展。去年7月间举行的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，提出了“到1961年底要在所有主要生活资料和消费品的每人平均消费量方面超过西德”的任务，今年德意志民主共和国的经济建设规模将更加宏伟。今年的工业产量计划比去年增加11.1％，农业社会主义改造也将获得进一步的发展。德意志民主共和国社会主义建设的胜利已经并且还将继续在整个德国和欧洲发生深远的影响。德意志民主共和国的力量愈加强大，欧洲的和平也就愈有保障。德意志民主共和国是一个统一、和平和民主的德国的基础，它代表着全体德意志人民的崇高希望和美好的未来。今天德意志民主共和国所走的道路，也是全体德意志人民的唯一正确的道路。
    德意志民主共和国是维护欧洲和平和安全的坚强堡垒，是反对美国侵略者在欧洲发动新战争的重要力量。德意志民主共和国为争取缔结对德和约和建立两个德国的邦联，为在和平民主的基础上统一自己的祖国作了坚持不懈的努力。德意志民主共和国日益吸引着越来越为广泛的全德爱好和平民主的力量，在维护欧洲和平和促进德意志民族统一成为爱好和平和民主的国家的事业中起着越来越为显著的作用。德意志民主共和国政府的和平外交政策和积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民维护和争取民族独立的立场受到了全世界一切爱好和平人民的信任和赞扬。这次以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问了一些亚非国家，并且受到了这些国家的政府和人民的热烈欢迎和友好接待。这无疑将进一步加强和扩大德意志民主共和国同这些国家的友好关系。不久以前，苏联政府本着维护和平和促进德国问题和平解决的崇高愿望，提出了从柏林撤退外国驻军，结束西柏林的占领状态和把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议，最近苏联政府提出对德和约草案，并且建议有关国家召开会议，讨论并签订对德和约。这些积极的建议得到德意志人民和全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人士的欢迎和支持。中国人民不仅完全支持苏联政府的这些合情合理的建议，并且支持德意志民主共和国政府在争取德意志民族统一成为爱好和平和民主的国家和解决柏林问题上的立场。我们深信，德意志人民为争取按和平民主原则统一祖国的正义斗争，必将获得最后胜利。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正在全力为实现社会主义建设的总路线而努力。在过去的一年中，我国工农业产品的产量有了巨大的增长，广大的农村基本上实现了公社化。今年我国人民正在继续苦战，争取1959年的工农业生产更大的跃进。我国经济建设的成就，是同苏联和各兄弟国家的援助分不开的，中国人民十分珍视这种兄弟的支援。并且对这种兄弟的支援表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们，朋友们，国际形势对于全世界争取和平的人民从来没有像现在这样好过，我们正处在东风已经压倒并且将继续压倒西风的伟大时代，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国正在蒸蒸日上，团结日益巩固，互助关系日益发展。不久以前，苏联提出的1959年至1965年发展国民经济计划的控制数字是一个具有伟大意义的建设共产主义的纲领，它代表着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国朝气勃勃的新气象和社会主义制度的优越性。苏联最近又成功地发射了世界上第一个宇宙火箭，再一次有力地证明了苏联在最新的科学技术方面，已经远远地把美国抛在后面了。同时，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，也有了巨大的发展。伊拉克民族革命的伟大胜利，使帝国主义在中东遭到了惨重的失败。阿尔及利亚人民正在进行着英勇的民族解放战争，他们的正义斗争获得了全世界人民的广泛同情和坚决支持。过去一直被殖民主义者视为
  “安定”的非洲大陆，现在怒吼起来了。比属刚果的人民争取独立的运动正在轰轰烈烈的发展着。民族解放运动的烽火已经燃遍了整个非洲。同时，过去被美帝国主义者视为自己“后院”的拉丁美洲，民族民主运动也在轰轰烈烈地发展着。古巴人民已经推翻了巴蒂斯塔的亲美的卖国独裁政府。美帝国主义者正在千方百计地对古巴内政进行干涉。古巴人民正在英勇地开展着反对美国干涉的全民斗争。我们完全同情和坚决支持古巴人民、刚果人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切为民族独立而斗争的人民。我们坚信在强大的社会主义阵营和全世界一切主持正义的人民和国家的同情和支持下，他们的英勇斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    在社会主义阵营欣欣向荣和民族解放运动日益高涨的面前，帝国主义的没落已经更加明显了。它们的经济危机正在继续加深和扩大，内部的矛盾更加尖锐，正在走向分崩离析。尽管帝国主义还在作最后的垂死挣扎，但是世界上没有任何力量可以挽救它的灭亡。帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。正如毛泽东同志所说“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。这就是我们今天时代的最根本的特点。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是同年同月诞生的兄弟国家，自从成立以来，我们两国就共同在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大家庭中，互相支持，并肩前进。几年来，我们两国在中德友好合作条约的基础上，在政治、经济、文化等方面的合作关系得到了全面的发展。中国人民在建设社会主义和反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中一贯受到德意志民主共和国人民的支持和援助。在这里，我谨代表中国人民向总理同志和代表团的全体同志们，并且通过你们向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。同样，我们中国人民也把支持德意志民主共和国人民的社会主义建设和争取祖国统一的正义斗争看作是自己的义不容辞的责任。中国人民不仅关心亚洲的和平，同时也关心欧洲的和平，如果帝国主义战争狂人胆敢侵犯德意志民主共和国，那末，不仅我们整个社会主义阵营各国将全力支持德意志民主共和国，全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的人士都将会站在德意志民主共和国一方面，侵略者必将自食其果。
    同志们，朋友们，让我们高呼：
    中德两国人民友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
