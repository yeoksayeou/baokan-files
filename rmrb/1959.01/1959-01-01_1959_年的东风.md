    The East Wind of 1959
    Guo Moruo

    1959 is a year of historical significance.

    Looking at the overall international situation, the imperialist bloc will become increasingly fragmented and rotten day by day; while socialist countries and nationalist countries will become increasingly united and mutually supportive, getting better day by day.

    In the Soviet Union, this is the year to begin implementing the magnificent new Seven-Year Plan, which, based on past experience, will undoubtedly be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded.

    The Soviet Union is the core force for maintaining world peace. The increasing strength of the Soviet Union means the increasing growth of peaceful forces, which is the relative weakening of the forces of war.

    In China, this is the year to welcome the glorious tenth National Day. We already have nine years of construction experience, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have a more solid grasp of making 1959 a year of even greater leap forward.

    Steel production will increase from 11 million tons to 18 million tons; coal production will increase from 270 million tons to 380 million tons; grain production will increase from 750 billion jin to about 1,050 billion jin; cotton production will increase from 67 million dan to about 100 million dan.

    The new task for 1959 is a greater leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. We will strive to follow the Party's instructions, closely combine revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, and will certainly complete these tasks ahead of schedule and exceed them.

    Of course, we must also more solidly learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and even the commendable experiences of the enemy. We must follow the Party's teachings, strategically despise the enemy, and tactically value the enemy. We must "know ourselves and know our enemy" to ensure "a hundred battles, a hundred victories."

    Whatever meets the demands of the people and the nation is a nascent force and will inevitably grow stronger day by day; whatever violates the demands of the people and the nation is a dying force and will inevitably rot day by day.

    The distance between the contrast of these two forces will become greater and greater.

    The East Wind of 1959 will undoubtedly further overwhelm the West Wind.

    1959年的东风
    郭沫若
    1959年是具有历史意义的一年。
    从整个国际形势来看，帝国主义集团将会愈见分崩离析，一天一天地更烂下去；而社会主义国家和民族主义国家将会愈见团结互助，一天一天地更好起来。
    这一年在苏联是开始执行雄伟的新七年计划的一年，根据以往的经验，无疑是将提前并超额完成的。
    苏联是维护世界和平的核心力量，苏联的日益强大便是和平力量的日益增长，也就是战争势力的相对的削弱。
    这一年在我们中国是要迎接第十次的光辉国庆的一年。我们已经有了九年的建设经验，特别是在1958年的大跃进之后，我们有了更扎实的把握能使1959年成为更大跃进的一年。
    钢的产量要由一千一百万吨增加到一千八百万吨；煤的产量要由二亿七千万吨增加到三亿八千万吨；粮的产量要由七千五百亿斤增加到一万零五百亿斤左右；棉的产量要由六千七百万担增加到一亿担左右。
    1959年新的任务是在去年大跃进的基础上更大的跃进。我们努力遵照着党的指示，把革命热情和科学精神密切地结合起来，也一定会提前和超额完成这些任务。
    当然，我们还须得更扎实地学习苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，甚至敌人的可取经验。我们要遵从党的教导，在战略上藐视敌人，而在战术上重视敌人。我们要“知彼知己”，然后才能保证“百战百胜”。
    凡是合乎人民的要求、民族的要求的是方生力量，必然会一天一天地壮大起来；凡是违反人民的要求、民族的要求的是方死的力量，必然会一天一天地腐烂下去。
    在两种力量的对比之间，距离将要显得愈来愈大。
    1959年的东风，毫无疑问，必将进一步压倒西风。
