Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 17th: Under the situation of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," Tianjin City newly built and expanded 400 industrial projects last year. By the end of last year, 291 of them had been fully or partially put into production. The commissioning of these projects has further changed the production landscape of Tianjin and provided conditions for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year.

Last year, Tianjin's industrial capital construction investment accounted for more than 62% of the city's total capital construction investment; the focus of investment was on the steel industry and the electromechanical industry. Since the city's people, under the leadership of the Party, launched a steel-grabbing campaign in August last year, the newly built No. 2 and No. 3 steelmaking plants of Tianjin Steel Plant and the newly built Beicang branch of Xinxing Steel Plant have been completed successively and put into production successively last year. The newly added equipment capacity has increased nearly five times compared with the original, and the ironmaking capacity has also increased. With the development of steel production, Tianjin's refractory materials and steel rolling industries have also been expanded. In addition to the expansion of three workshops for strip steel, welded pipes, and thin plates in the No. 1 Steel Rolling Plant, a seamless steel pipe plant was also newly built. After these newly built and expanded steel rolling plants were put into production successively, Tianjin can now produce thin plates and seamless steel pipes in batches, which it could not produce in the past.

Last year, Tianjin's electromechanical industry began to build several large-scale enterprises, and newly built and expanded machine tool factories, motor and electrical appliance factories, and transportation machinery factories that can produce higher-precision products. The first phase of the expansion project of the Xin'an Motor Factory has been basically completed, and the newly added production capacity is equivalent to more than five times the original production capacity. The expansion project of the transformer factory has been put into production successively, which not only increased the output, but also can produce large transformers.

Tianjin faces the Bohai Sea. In order to develop the marine chemical industry, Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Plant, Dagu Chemical Plant, Tianjin Chemical Plant, etc., all started expansion last year. In addition, the chemical industry sector also expanded the pesticide plant and expanded the production capacity of tires. The power industry, light industry, and textile industry have also been further developed through new construction and expansion. The Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant built a new generator with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts in September last year; it is still under expansion, striving for the new generator to participate in operation in the first quarter of this year. The paper industry expanded eight factories, increasing the paper production capacity by 20%. The production capacity of rubber shoes, bicycles, and sewing machines has also increased this year. In order to meet the needs of the development of the chemical industry, the Changlu Tang Duyan Saltworks started expanding the Dagu salt fields last year, and according to the design capacity, the newly added output each year reaches more than 630,000 tons.

    为更大跃进准备条件
    天津近三百个工业项目投入生产
    新华社天津17日电　在“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的形势下，天津市去年新建扩建的工业项目有四百个，到去年年底全部和部分投入生产的有二百九十一个。这些工程投入生产后，就进一步改变了天津市的生产面貌，并且为今年工农业生产更大的跃进提供了条件。
    去年，天津市工业基本建设投资约占全市基本建设投资总额的62％以上；投资的重点是钢铁工业和机电工业。从去年8月全市人民在党的领导下掀起夺钢大战以来，天津钢厂新建的第二、第三两个炼钢厂和新兴钢厂新建的北仓分厂先后落成，并且在去年陆续投入了生产，新增加的设备能力比原来提高近五倍，炼铁能力也有增加。随着钢铁生产的发展，天津市耐火材料和轧钢行业也进行了扩建。除了轧钢一厂扩建了带钢、焊管、薄板等三个车间以外，还新建了无缝钢管厂。这些新建、扩建的轧钢工厂陆续投入生产后，天津市过去不能生产的薄板和无缝钢管等，也可以成批生产了。
    去年，天津市机电工业开始兴建了几个大型企业，并且新建、扩建了能够生产精密度较高的机床工厂、电机电器工厂和运输机械工厂。新安电机厂第一期扩建工程已基本竣工，新增的生产能力相当于原有生产能力的五倍多。变压器厂扩建工程已经陆续投入生产，不仅提高了产量，并且可以生产大型的变压器。
    天津面临渤海。为了发展海洋化学工业，永利久大沽厂、大沽化工厂、天津化工厂等，都在去年开始扩建。此外，化学工业部门还扩建了农药厂，扩大了轮胎的生产能力。电力工业、轻工业、纺织工业通过新建和扩建也有了进一步发展。天津第一发电厂在去年9月间，新建了一座容量两万五千瓩的发电机；目前还在进行扩建工程，争取新发电机在今年第一季度参加运行。造纸工业扩建了八个厂，使造纸生产能力增长了20％。胶鞋、自行车、缝纫机的生产能力也在这一年中有了提高。长芦塘大盐场适应化学工业发展的需要，去年开始扩建大沽盐田，按设计能力计算，每年新增加的产量达六十三万多吨。
