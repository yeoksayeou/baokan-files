    A Dining Hall for Four Ethnic Groups
    The public dining hall of the Shangtang Production Team in Piaoli Commune, Longsheng Autonomous County, serves 113 people from 26 households of four ethnic groups: Han, Zhuang, Miao, and Dong. The dining hall prepares different dishes for everyone according to the different living habits of each ethnic group, with various salted vegetables, spicy dishes, and pickled vegetables, making it rich and diverse. Originally, this production team, during the advanced cooperative, was called the Ninth Team. The team had the most Han and Zhuang people. They used to eat collectively, but because of different living habits, they often disagreed about the food, and the collective broke up in March 1957. "Small rivers are not as long as the Yangtze River, and small cooperatives are not as strong as people's communes." In August 1958, everyone joined together again to establish a people's commune. This time, from the day the commune was established, everyone expressed that they wanted to strengthen unity, help each other, learn from each other, and make progress together. In order to run the collective dining hall well, they established a five-person management committee with representatives from the Han, Zhuang, Dong, and Miao ethnic groups. In addition to providing good food, the dining hall also provides hot water for washing feet and faces in the morning and evening. Now, the 26 households eating in this dining hall live, produce, and study together, no longer distinguishing between Han, Zhuang, Dong, and Miao.

    四个民族的食堂
    龙胜各族自治县瓢里公社上塘生产队的公共食堂，共有汉、僮、苗、侗四个民族二十六户一百一十三人吃饭。食堂根据各个民族生活习惯的不同为大家做不同的饭菜，咸菜、辣菜、酸菜，样样都有，丰富多采。原来这个生产队，在高级社时，叫第九队，队里的汉族与僮族最多，原来也是集体开伙的，因为生活习惯不同，时常为了菜饭闹意见，曾在1957年3月散了伙。“小河不比长江长，小社不如公社强”。1958年8月大家又合到一起建立人民公社。这次，从建立公社那天起，大家就表示，要加强团结，互助互学，共同进步。为了办好集体食堂，他们建立了一个五人管理委员会，汉、僮、侗、苗族都有人参加。食堂除去办好了饭菜，早晚还有热水洗脚洗脸。现在在这一个食堂吃饭的二十六户人，大家生产、生活和学习都在一起，不再分汉、僮、侗、苗族了。
