Hard Work Plus Ingenuity, Technology Improves Daily
— Visiting the Tool Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition
By our reporter Zhu Cheng

While touring the various exhibition rooms and performance areas of the Tool Pavilion at the National Agricultural Exhibition, seeing those exquisite tool exhibits, and recalling the bumper agricultural harvest of 1958, a concept became increasingly clear in people's minds: "Tools are humanity's weapons for conquering nature. When weapons are improved, less labor is spent, and the wealth that nature gives to people is greater!"

The experience of 1958 was precisely like this. In that year, under the illumination of the General Line, the great wave of tool reform, combined with other increased production measures, formed a tremendous force, pushing China's agricultural production to unprecedented heights.

Everything Requires Ingenuity

The Water Conservancy Tool Exhibition area displayed various soil transportation and ramming tools. A large portion of these tools were created in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958. Seeing these tools, people couldn't help but think of the previous winter and spring.

At that time, the mass movement to strive for a great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 swept the country. The high tide of water conservancy construction rose wave upon wave, higher and higher. At this very moment, weapons for achieving ingenuity, the crystallization of mass wisdom—thousands of types of improved water conservancy construction tools—were born. Pao Ma Township in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, reformed fourteen types of water conservancy construction tools, increasing work efficiency by more than three times. Because the whole township vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction, the 100,000 workdays that they were short in three months were solved by increasing work efficiency through improved tools. This province promoted the experience of Pao Ma Township, and from then on, "One township runs like a horse, the whole province gallops." In Anhui, in Henan..., following the appearance of the first batch of improved tools, the mass movement to reform water conservancy construction tools spread like wildfire everywhere.

The effect of improving water conservancy construction tools enlightened the masses: in order to increase production, improve all tools, and do everything with ingenuity. By early December of last year, the number of tools invented, created, and improved throughout the country numbered in the tens of thousands, with more than 349 million pieces promoted.

Three Characteristics

The exhibits in the Tool Pavilion showed people that the tool reform movement, developed under the guidance of the idea of ingenuity, had three distinct characteristics: first, broad scope; second, penetration into every process of production; and third, increasingly refined improvements, developing in the direction of semi-mechanization and mechanization.

The wide scope of tool reform reflected the masses' demand to do everything with ingenuity. Among the exhibits on display, there were not only those used for agricultural production but also those used for forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production; there were various processing tools for agricultural and sideline products, as well as improved cooking utensils, homemade lathes for manufacturing some of the improved tools, and various sources of power energy such as water, fire, wind, gas (marsh gas and natural gas), machines, and electricity, all excavated by the masses using indigenous methods and equipment.

Using indigenous methods to discover various power energy sources was the masses' way of wanting to work even more ingeniously, allowing various power sources to replace manual labor. An electrical construction schematic model in the Tool Pavilion explained that Yongchun County in Fujian Province had already begun to let hydroelectric power replace manual labor. Last year, the masses of this county, through self-raised funds and self-made equipment, established 1,041 hydroelectric power stations, with a total power generation of more than 5,800 kilowatts. More than 90% of the county's processing of agricultural and sideline products has been mechanized. Because the Dongping District of this county has mechanized the processing of agricultural and sideline products, it can save more than 50,000 labor workdays throughout the year. In the marsh gas exhibition room, you will see another scene: Fuyang County in Anhui Province, one of the national marsh gas pioneer counties, relying on the inventions and creations of the masses, using indigenous methods and equipment, realized marsh gasification throughout the county in ten days. Now, more than 80% of the county's population uses marsh gas for lighting and cooking.

In terms of depth, let's look at the exhibited agricultural production tools. Those exhibits show that from preparatory farming to plowing, harrowing, sowing, cultivating, weeding, autumn harvesting, threshing, processing, transportation, etc., almost every agricultural task in the four seasons has seen inventions, creations, and improvements in the tools used. Compared with old-fashioned tools, these improved tools have increased work efficiency by two, five, eight, or even more than twenty times.

People who visited the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, which opened on May 5, 1958, will definitely get a deep impression after visiting the Tool Pavilion this time: since then, the national tool reform movement has developed greatly forward. What gives people this impression is not only that various tools are being improved more and more finely but also that people have seen two new exhibits that were not seen at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition.

One is the rope-drawn machine. This labor-saving and efficient machine, which can be used for various purposes and can be driven by various power sources, has been promoted to more than 2.68 million units throughout the country, and it has greatly demonstrated its power in the deep plowing movement.

The other is ball bearings. A chart tells people that in just a few months, more than 480,000 units for manufacturing ball bearings have been established throughout the country, producing 120 million sets of ball bearings, and 45 million pieces of operating tools have been installed with ball bearings. It is precisely because of this that the broad masses have firmly grasped it in the development of the tool reform movement. By early December of last year, 767 counties across the country had achieved ball bearingization of operating tools. Why is the manufacture and installation of ball bearings so fast? A folk song on the wall of the Tool Pavilion reveals its reason: "Small ball bearings, the size of soybeans, are not afraid of thousands of pounds, installed on operating tools, it's like riding a thousand-mile horse."

Agricultural Machinery is Developing

If you think that China's agricultural technological revolution is only engaged in tool improvement, then you are wrong. The exhibits in the various exhibition rooms and performance areas of the Tool Pavilion tell people that in the agricultural technological revolution, in addition to improving tools and vigorously engaging in semi-mechanization, gradually transitioning to mechanization, at the same time, according to the conditions of industrial development, the area of ​​machine farming is gradually expanded, and preparations are made for mechanization and electrification. In 1958, the number of tractors nationwide increased to 41,500, and the area of ​​machine farming accounted for 5.1% of the total cultivated area, reaching more than 85 million mu. In this year, many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have been able to manufacture tractors. However, the exhibits in the exhibition hall clearly tell people that this year, 1959, improved tools plus ball bearings to achieve semi-mechanization is still the main thing.

A prominent creation in the tide of tool reform in 1958 was the electric plow created by the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute on the basis of the Jiangsu rope-drawn machine. This electric plow has become the most attractive exhibit in the Tool Pavilion.

On the left side of the exhibition, there is a piece of flat land, where a group of people are visiting farmland. But, strangely enough, a plow is automatically plowing the land and moving forward, pulled by a steel cable. When it reaches the end of the field, it automatically shifts and plows forward in the opposite direction. Neither a plowman nor an operator can be seen in the field. It turns out that the plow operator is pressing a button in a working pavilion in the corner of this field. In this working pavilion, which can protect against wind and snow in winter and avoid the scorching sun in summer, he looks out from the bright glass window and sees the plow reaching the end of the field. When he presses the button, the electric motor pulls the plow back through the steel cable.

This is the electric plow.

The birth of the electric plow in 1958 is one of the countless bright flowers blooming in the technological revolution. Its birth has opened up a new possible shortcut for China's agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    实干加巧干　技术日日新
    ——访全国农业展览会工具馆
    本报记者　朱成
    在全国农业展览会工具馆的各展览室、表演场巡行的时候，看到那些精巧的工具展品，联想到1958年的农业大丰收，一个概念在人们的头脑里越来越清晰：“工具，是人类征服自然的武器，武器改良了，花费的劳力就少；而大自然交给人们的财富却多！”
    1958年的经历正是这样的。这一年，在总路线的照耀下，工具改革的巨浪，汇合着其他各项增产措施，形成了一股巨大的力量，把我国的农业生产推上了有史以来的新高峰。
    事事都要巧干
    水利工具展览场展出了各种运土夯实工具。这些工具有很大一部分是1957年冬季和1958年春天诞生的。看到这些工具，人们不禁想起了前一个冬春的情况。
    那时候，力争1958年农业大跃进的群众运动席卷了全国。兴修水利的高潮一浪接着一浪，越涨越高。就在这时候，实现巧干的武器，群众智慧的结晶——千百种兴修水利的改良工具诞生了。湖北省当阳县跑马乡改革了十四种水利施工工具，工效提高三倍以上。全乡由于大搞水利建设，在三个月中所缺的十万个工，都从改良工具提高工效中解决了。这个省推广了跑马乡的经验，从此，“一乡跑马，全省飞奔”。在安徽，在河南……，都随着第一批改良工具的出现，改革水利施工工具的群众运动，犹如燎原之火，燃遍了各地。
    改良水利施工工具的效果，启发了群众：为了提高生产，改良所有的工具，事事都要巧干。到去年12月上旬，全国各地发明创造和改良的工具种类数以万计，推广了三亿四千九百多万件。
    三个特点
    工具馆里那些展品向人们表明，在巧干的思想指导下发展起来的工具改革运动，有三个鲜明的特点：第一是广泛性；第二是深入生产的每个过程；第三是越改越精，向半机械化、机械化的方向发展。
    工具改革的面广，反映了群众事事都要巧干的要求。在展出的展品中，不仅有用于农业生产的，也有用于林牧副业生产的；有农副产品各种加工工具，也有改良炊事用具，有制造部分改良工具的土车床，还有被群众用土办法土设备挖掘出来的水、火、风、气（沼气和天然气）、机、电等各种动力能源。
    用土办法发掘各种动力能源，是群众想要干的更巧，让各种动力代替人力操作。工具馆中一个电气化建设示意模型说明，福建省永春县已经开始让水力电力来代替人力操作了。这个县的群众，在去年自筹资金，自造设备，建立了一千零四十一座水力电力站，发电量共达五千八百多瓩，全县90％以上的农副产品加工实现了机械化。这个县的东平区由于农副产品加工实现了机械化，全年可节省劳动用工五万多个。在沼气展览室，你又会看到另一幅景象：全国沼气化先锋县之一的安徽省阜阳县，依靠群众的发明创造，利用土办法土设备，在十天中全县就实现了沼气化，现在全县有80％以上的人口用沼气点灯、烧饭。　　在深的方面，就看看展出的农业生产工具吧。那些展品显示：从备耕起，到耕耙播种、中耕除草、秋收、脱粒、加工、运输等等，几乎四个季节每项农活使用的工具都有发明创造和改良。这些改良工具，和旧式工具比较起来，工效都提高二倍、五倍、八倍，甚至二十倍以上。　参观过1958年5月5日开幕的全国农具展览会的人们，这次在工具馆参观以后，一定会获得一个很深的印象：从那时以来，全国的工具改革运动大大向前发展了。让人们获得这种印象的，除了各种工具越改越精以外，还由于人们看到了在全国农具展览会上没有看到的两种新展品。
    一种是绳索牵引机。这种省工出活可作多种用途并可用各种动力带动的机器，已在全国推广了二百六十八万多部，它在深翻土地运动中，大大地显示了威力。
    一种是滚珠轴承。一幅图表告诉人们：全国各地在短短的几个月中已经建立制造滚珠轴承的单位四十八万多处，生产滚珠轴承一亿二千万套，安装滚珠轴承的运转工具已达四千五百万件。正是因为这样，广大群众在工具改革运动的发展中才紧紧地抓住了它。到去年12月上旬，全国已有七百六十七个县实现了运转工具滚珠轴承化。滚珠轴承的制造和安装为什么这样快？工具馆的墙壁上一首民谣道出了它的原因：“小小滚珠黄豆大，千斤万斤它不怕，运转工具安上它，好像跨上千里马”。
    农业机械在发展
    如果你以为我国的农业技术革命只是在搞工具改良，那就错了。工具馆的各个展览室和表演场的展品告诉人们，在农业技术革命上，除了改良工具大搞半机械化，再逐渐向机械化过渡之外，同时还根据工业发展的条件，逐步扩大机耕面积，并为机械化、电气化作准备。1958年全国的拖拉机已经增至四万一千五百台，机耕面积占总耕地面积5.1％，达八千五百多万亩。在这一年，全国许多省、市和自治区已经能够制造拖拉机。但是，展览馆的展品明确告诉人们，今年，1959年，改良工具加滚珠轴承实现半机械化仍然是主要的。
    1958年在工具改革的浪潮中一项突出的创造，是北京农业机械化研究所在江苏绳索牵引机的基础上创造的电犁。这种电犁成了工具馆最吸引人的展品。
    在展览会的左侧有一片平地，那里有一群人在参观耕地。但是，奇怪得很，一台犁被一条钢丝绳牵引着在地里自动地翻耕着土地前进，走到地头，又自动地移行，向相反的方向翻耕前进。在地里既看不到扶犁的人，也看不到操纵者。原来，操犁人却在这片田地的一角一间工作亭里按电钮。他在这间冬能防风御雪、夏能避免烈日曝晒的工作亭里，从明亮的玻璃窗中望去，看到那台犁走到地头，一按电钮，电动机便通过钢丝绳把犁牵引回来。
    这就是电犁。
    1958年电犁的诞生是技术革命中开放的无数鲜艳的花朵之一。它的诞生为我国农业机械化电气化又新辟了一条可能的捷径。
