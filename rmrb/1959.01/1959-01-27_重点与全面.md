In our work, we must always seek the key issues; grasp them, and solving them will drive the overall situation. The news published in today's newspaper about Jianyang County highlighting key areas, taking care of all aspects, and allocating labor proportionally, resulting in a vigorous new upsurge in production, is proof of this.

People's communes, in a certain period, need to have a clear understanding of the main issues to be addressed. Based on the immediate needs, focusing labor on these aspects while also attending to general tasks is called reasonable allocation. From a national perspective, the most important issue in agricultural production currently is fertilizer. All aspects of agricultural production conditions this year have greatly improved, and crops are planted very well, but the fertilizer work cannot fully adapt to the new requirements under the new situation. Therefore, accumulating and producing fertilizer is truly the top priority and should currently take the lead. It should be placed at the forefront of all work, as the most prominent focus. In terms of labor allocation, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of highlighting key areas and allocate more labor to the fertilizer accumulation and production front. At the same time, it is also necessary to widely mobilize the masses and rapidly launch a mass movement in which everyone participates in accumulating fertilizer.

Of course, where there is a focus, there must be non-focused areas, and what is temporarily non-focused may turn into a focus in the future. For those temporarily non-focused areas, appropriate guarantees should be given in terms of labor allocation according to a certain proportion, based on the principle of taking care of all aspects. This will not only complete the main tasks but also take care of other aspects. This will enable this year's production to have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    重点与全面
    作工作，时时刻刻都要寻求工作中的关键问题；抓住它，解决了，就能带动全局。今天本报发表的简阳县突出重点，照顾全面，按比例安排劳动力，出现了生产上轰轰烈烈的新高潮的消息，就是一个证明。
    人民公社在一定时期中，主要抓什么问题，需要心中有数。根据当务之急，把劳动力的重点安放到这方面去，并兼顾一般任务，这就叫合理安排。从全国来说，农业生产当前最主要的问题是肥料。今年农业生产的各方面条件全有极大改进，庄稼种得很好，就是肥料工作还不能完全适应新形势下的新要求。因此积肥造肥实为当务之急，目前应该挂帅。应该把它安排到所有工作的最前面去，作为最突出的重点。这样，在劳力安排上也就需要根据重点突出的原则，把更多的劳力安排到积肥造肥战线上去。同时还要广泛发动群众，迅速掀起一个人人动手大搞积肥的群众性的运动。
    当然，有重点必有非重点，而一时的非重点将来也可能转变成重点。对于那些一时的非重点，就要根据照顾全面的原则，在劳力上按一定比例给予适当的保证。这样既能完成主要任务，而又照顾了其他方面。这就将使今年的生产能有更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
