Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - US President Eisenhower presented the budget message for the 1960 fiscal year to the US Congress on the 19th. The message reflects the dilemma of the US ruling group on financial issues: on the one hand, it wants to continue to maintain military spending at the highest level in peacetime in order to intensify the arms race, especially the atomic arms race, and use this to stimulate the US economy in crisis; on the other hand, facing a serious financial crisis, it does not dare to openly propose maintaining such a huge fiscal deficit as in the previous fiscal year. Therefore, the message proposes to further increase taxes and reduce civilian expenses, placing a heavier burden on the American people, in order to achieve "a general balance of income and expenditure."

The message stipulates that in the 1960 fiscal year, from July 1 this year to June 30 next year, the US government's budget expenditure will be $77 billion, $3 billion less than the estimated figure for the 1959 fiscal year. However, the message shows that this reduction in book expenditure does not mean that the number of actual appropriations requested by the US government from Congress has decreased. The number of new contract rights that the US government requires Congress to approve in the 1960 fiscal year is $86.8 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion compared to the 1959 fiscal year.

    Maintaining Huge Military Spending, Intensifying the Development of Missiles and Nuclear Weapons

The message stipulates that in the 1960 fiscal year, direct military expenditures in government spending (including the Department of Defense's expenses, atomic energy programs, strategic material reserves, and foreign military "aid" four items) totaled more than $45.8 billion, accounting for nearly 60% of the total budget expenditure, about the same as the 1959 fiscal year. If we add the expenses for veterans, the interest on the national debt accumulated mainly due to war and the arms race, and other military expenditures not listed under military spending items, direct and indirect military expenditures account for more than three-quarters of the total expenditure.

The message emphasizes that in the 1960 fiscal year, there will be a "focus shift" in US military spending, that is, to further increase the proportion of expenditures for missile weapons and nuclear weapons in total military spending. The message states that the Department of Defense will greatly increase expenditures on purchasing missiles and developing new weapons and measuring the effectiveness of new weapons, and reduce expenditures on other purchases and construction. The message also said that the share of missile systems in the total (military) procurement expenditure will increase in 1960. It is reported that in the 1959 fiscal year, nearly a quarter of the funds in the United States' military procurement were used to purchase missiles.

Regarding atomic armament, the message said that the Atomic Energy Commission's expenditure will reach a record $2.7 billion in the 1960 fiscal year. Although the United States is currently conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union in Geneva on the cessation of nuclear tests, the message still requires Congress to "must stipulate financial authorization in order to continue to develop and produce nuclear weapons at the current high level." The message also said: "The (nuclear weapon) test sites in Nevada and the Pacific will be retained on a ready-to-use basis." The message also shows that the US "Department of Defense will continue to study how to use (artificial) satellites for specific military purposes."

In military spending, the 1960 budget, like the previous year, also stipulates a so-called Department of Defense emergency fund of $150 million. As everyone knows, in the 1959 fiscal year, this fund was mainly used for military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.

    Continuing to Use the Guise of Aid, Striving to Carry Out Foreign Expansion

When talking about the issue of foreign "aid," the message once again clamored to strengthen the aggressive military groups pieced together by the United States under the guise of so-called "resisting the communist threat," and further urged the "allied countries" participating in these groups to provide cannon fodder and expand their armaments. The message stipulates that in the 1960 fiscal year, direct and indirect military "aid" accounted for $2.63 billion of the US's $3.49 billion in foreign "aid" funds.

The message emphasizes the need to increase "economic assistance" and "technical assistance" in order to pave the way for US monopoly capital to further penetrate other countries, especially African and Latin American countries. The message states that the United States will try to sign agreements with "friendly countries" to reduce the "trade barriers" of these countries. "The United States also hopes to negotiate tax treaties aimed at encouraging its citizens to invest abroad… In addition, the State Department and the Department of Commerce's Business Advisory Committee are studying ways to expand the role of private investment, management and technical training abroad." The US government also requires an increase in its investment in the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" and the "International Monetary Fund" in order to better control these two organizations to serve the foreign expansion of US monopoly capital.

    Cutting Civilian Expenditures in Many Ways, Massively Increasing Harsh Taxes and Levies

When it comes to the US government's civilian expenditures, Eisenhower made no secret of his disregard for the lives and welfare of the American people in the message. Although the economic crisis has put the American working people in distress, he suggested reducing expenditures on "labor and welfare" by $260 million, reducing expenditures on agriculture (mainly expenditures to maintain agricultural product prices) by more than $700 million, and reducing expenditures on commerce and housing construction by more than $1.2 billion in the 1960 fiscal year. At the same time, the message stipulates that the income for the 1960 fiscal year is $77 billion, an increase of $9 billion compared to the 1959 fiscal year. Since taxes are the main source of income for the US government, this means that taxes will be greatly increased. The message requires Congress to agree to extend the effective period of last year's decision not to reduce consumption taxes by one year, and to increase gasoline taxes and postal rates.

    Huge Deficits Cannot Be Made Up
    Balance of Income and Expenditure is Purely an Illusion

Although this message emphasizes that it is necessary to "generally equalize income and expenditure" and "avoid deficits" in the 1960 fiscal year to prevent further increases in the cost of living and further inflation, Eisenhower himself is clearly lacking confidence in this point. The message requires increasing the national debt limit from the current $280 billion to $285 billion, which is to prepare for further borrowing to make up for deficits. The fact shows that Eisenhower also proposed a budget with roughly equal income and expenditure at the beginning of 1959, but the result was an estimated deficit of $12.9 billion. Therefore, according to Western news agencies, many Democratic congressmen are now dissatisfied with this budget plan for the 1960 fiscal year. They accuse the Republican government of deliberately making a budget with the illusion of "balanced income and expenditure" from the perspective of the 1960 presidential election, attempting to pass it to the Democratic-controlled Congress for modification, in order to shift the responsibility for the imbalance of income and expenditure to the Democrats.

### 维持巨额军事开支　加重捐税弥补亏空  美总统提出加紧搜括人民预算

    维持巨额军事开支　加重捐税弥补亏空
    美总统提出加紧搜括人民预算
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔19日向美国国会提出了1960财政年度的预算咨文。咨文反映了美国统治集团在财政问题上进退维谷的处境：它一方面要继续把军事开支维持在和平时期最高的水平上，以加紧进行军备竞赛。特别是原子军备竞赛，并且以此刺激陷于危机中的美国经济，另一方面，面临着严重的财政危机，它又不敢公然提出保持像上一财政年度那样巨大的财政赤字，因此，咨文提出要进一步增加捐税和削减民用费用，把更沉重的负担加在美国人民头上，这样来达到“收支大体上的平衡”。
    咨文规定，在从今年7月1日到明年6月30日为止的1960财政年度内，美国政府的预算支出是七百七十亿美元，比1959财政年度概算少三十亿美元。但是咨文表明，这种账面开支的减少并不意味着美国政府要求国会实际拨款的数目有所减少，美国政府要求国会批准在1960财政年度的新订合同权的数目是八百六十八亿美元，比1959财政年度还增加了四十四亿美元。
    维持庞大军事开支  加紧发展导弹核弹
    咨文规定，在1960财政年度的政府开支中，直接的军事费用（包括国防部经费、原子能计划、战略原料储备和对外军事“援助”四个项目）共为四百五十八亿余美元，差不多占预算总支出60％。同1959财政年度的数字不相上下。如果再加上用于退伍军人的费用、偿付主要由于战争和军备竞赛而积累起来的国债的利息以及其他不列在军事开支项目下的军事开支，直接和间接的军事开支一共占了总开支四分之三以上。
    咨文强调，在1960财政年度，美国的军事开支将有“重点的改变”，就是进一步增加用于导弹武器和核武器的费用在军事总开支中的比重。咨文说，国防部将大大增加采购导弹以及发展新武器和衡量新武器的效能方面的支出，减少其他方面的采购和建设的支出。咨文还说，1960年的导弹系统在（军事）采购开支总额中所占份额将增加。据报道，在1959年度，美国的军事采购方面，已经有将近四分之一的款项是用于采购导弹的。
    关于原子军备，咨文说，原子能委员会的开支在1960财政年度将达到二十七亿美元的创纪录数字。尽管美国现在正在日内瓦同苏联进行关于停止核试验的谈判，咨文仍然要求国会“必须规定财政上的授权，以便继续在目前很高的水平上发展和生产核武器”。咨文还说：“内华达和太平洋的（核武器）试验场将在随时备用的基础上予以保留”。咨文还表明，美国“国防部将继续研究如何把（人造）卫星用于具体的军事目的”。
    在军事开支中，1960年度的预算和上一年度一样，还规定了一亿五千万美元的所谓国防部紧急基金。大家知道，在1959财政年度中，这笔款项主要是用于进行在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅的。
    继续打起援助幌子  竭力进行对外扩张
    咨文在谈到对外“援助”问题时再一次在所谓“抵御共产主义威胁”的幌子下叫嚷要加强美国拼凑的侵略性军事集团，进一步鞭策参加这些集团的“盟国”提供炮灰和扩充军备。咨文规定，在1960财政年度美国三十四点九亿美元的对外“援助”款项中，直接和间接的军事“援助”占了二十六点三亿美元。
    咨文强调要增加“经济援助”和“技术援助”，以此为美国垄断资本进一步渗入其他国家、特别是非洲和拉丁美洲国家开路。咨文说，美国将要设法同“友好国家”签订协定，减少这些国家的“贸易障碍”。“美国还希望谈判旨在鼓励它的公民在国外进行投资的税收条约……此外国务院和商务部企业顾问委员会正在研究扩大私人在国外的投资、管理和技术训练的作用的方法。”美国政府也要求增加它在“国际复兴开发银行”和“国际货币基金组织”中的投资，以便更好地控制这两个组织来为美国垄断资本对外扩充服务。
    多方削减民用开支  大量增加苛捐杂税
    谈到美国政府的民用开支，艾森豪威尔在咨文里毫不掩饰他对美国人民的生活和福利的漠视。尽管经济危机使美国劳动人民处在困厄之中，但是他却建议在1960财政年度把用在“劳工和福利”方面的开支减少二亿六千万美元，把用在农业方面的开支（主要是维持农产品价格的开支）减少七亿余美元，用在商业和房屋建筑的开支减少十二亿余美元。同时，咨文规定1960财政年度的收入是七百七十亿美元，比1959财政年度增加九十亿美元。由于税收是美国政府主要收入，这就意味着捐税将大大增加。咨文要求国会同意把在去年作出的关于不减低消费税的决定的有效期间延长一年，并且提高汽油税和邮资。
    巨额赤字无法弥补
    收支平衡纯属假象
    尽管这个咨文强调要在1960财政年度“收支大体相等”，“避免赤字”，以防止生活费用的进一步增加和通货进一步膨胀，但是这一点连艾森豪威尔本人也显然是缺乏信心的。咨文要求把国债限额从目前的二千八百亿美元提高到二千八百五十亿美元，就是为进一步举债以弥补赤字作准备的。事实表明，艾森豪威尔在1959年初也提出了一个收支大体相等的预算，而其结果却是估计将有一百二十九亿美元的赤字。因此，据西方通讯社报道，许多民主党议员现在对1960年度这个预算计划表示不满，他们指责共和党政府从1960年的总统竞选考虑，故意作出一个具有“收支平衡”假象的预算，企图假手民主党控制的国会来加以修改，以便把收支失去平衡的责任推给民主党人。
