Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd. Many well-known figures in the capital's scientific and literary circles today expressed their firm support for the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism. They unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' bloody suppression of the Congolese people.

The famous physicist and vice president of Peking University, Zhou Peiyuan, said: "I firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people for independence, freedom and democracy. The Cuban people have the right to deal with the Batista criminals who rode on their heads in the past. The victory of the Cuban people is a great encouragement to the Latin American and African people who are deeply oppressed by imperialism." Zhou Peiyuan also expressed his firm opposition to the Belgian colonialists' colonial rule over the Congolese people, saying: "The Congolese people who have been enslaved for eighty years must be liberated. The Belgian colonialists who are supported by U.S. imperialism to oppress the African people must give up their cruel rule over the Congolese people."

Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University, warmly supported the resolute measures taken by the Cuban people to maintain national sovereignty and try Batista's criminals. He said that this is entirely Cuba's internal affair, and the United States has no right to interfere at all. Now is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the era of vigorous development of national independence movements. As long as the people unite and fight resolutely, imperialism will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

The famous architect and director of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University, Liang Sicheng, said: The Cuban people's just struggle to overthrow the Batista dictatorial rule pierced the U.S. imperialist paper tiger from its ass. This struggle once again proves that U.S. imperialism, which does all kinds of bad things and specializes in supporting reactionaries in various countries, is the public enemy of the people of the world.

The writer Lao She, who is writing a script reflecting the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people, said: "The people of Latin America and Africa are roaring and fighting in the huge waves against imperialism and for national independence! This furious tide is irresistible." He believes that the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people will surely achieve the final victory, and expressed his firm support for the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people.

The poet Xiao San, who had visited Latin America, said: "I have been to several countries in Latin America and also passed through the African continent and coast. Now, hearing the Cuban people's powerful and brave struggle and the Congolese people's just demands, it is like hearing the roars from Havana Square and the banks of the Congo River, which makes me particularly excited. Our people have also suffered the hardships imposed on us by imperialism and colonialism. Therefore, we have great sympathy for the struggles of various countries and nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America for freedom and independence, and express our firm support."

The Peking opera actor Li Shaochun, who visited South America for performance tours more than two years ago, was very excited today when he saw the news of the anti-American demonstrations by millions of people in Cuba in the newspaper. He said that he firmly believes that the Cuban people will defeat the interference of U.S. imperialism and win the final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 23rd. People from all walks of life in Tianjin resolutely support the national independence struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. Many factories, institutions, schools and streets held forums and report meetings to introduce the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. Participants unanimously condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialism.

Next to the huge open hearth furnace of the Tianjin Steel Plant, the steelworkers of the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Model Group - Qi Zisheng Group, who had just finished their shift, held a forum with the engineers. Zhao Fenglai, a steelworker, said indignantly: "Like the Cuban and Congolese people in the past, we Chinese people suffered the cruel rule and oppression of imperialism for a long time. Although the Chinese people and the Cuban and Congolese people are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts to defend world peace are the same, our struggle against imperialist aggression is common, and we firmly support the Cuban and Congolese people." Engineer Dong Zhenjiang said: "In the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind and the people of the world are becoming aware and progressing like never before, the Cuban people's just struggle is by no means isolated. U.S. imperialism supports Batista and all the dirtiest and stinkiest dregs and garbage in the world, and will eventually be strangled by the people of the world."

Teachers and students from universities and colleges in Tianjin also held many forums. Xu Yichi, a professor at Tianjin Normal University, said, "The Chinese people cheer for the victory of the Cuban people and for the heroic struggle of the Congolese people. We firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism." The second-year students of the Department of Education of Tianjin Normal University expressed their determination to stand together with the Cuban and Congolese people in the discussion. They pointed out that U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialism are vainly attempting to suppress the national independence movement and will inevitably suffer a disastrous defeat.

At a gathering held by representatives of residents of Xing'an Road, a protest letter was written on the spot to condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism and Belgian colonialism. Many readers also wrote letters to Tianjin Daily, expressing their determination to support the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. The letter from readers Tang Jing and others to Tianjin Daily said: "We warn the imperialists that your old road of aggression will not work!" (Attached picture)

    反殖民主义斗争的洪流不可抗拒
    古巴、刚果人民必获最后胜利
    北京天津各界谴责美国的干涉和比利时的野蛮镇压
    新华社23日讯　首都科学界和文艺界许多著名人士今天表示坚决支持古巴、刚果人民反对帝国主义的斗争，他们一致谴责美帝国主义干涉古巴内政、比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民的血腥镇压。
    著名物理学家、北京大学副校长周培源说：“我坚决支持古巴人民争取独立、自由和民主的正义斗争。古巴人民有权处理过去骑在他们头上的巴蒂斯塔罪犯，古巴人民的胜利对于深受帝国主义压迫的拉丁美洲人民、非洲人民是一个极大的鼓舞。”周培源还表示坚决反对比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民的殖民统治，他说：“被奴役了八十年的刚果人民必须获得解放，得到美帝国主义支持来压迫非洲人民的比利时殖民主义者必须放弃对刚果人民的残酷统治。”
    北京师范大学校长陈垣热烈支持古巴人民为维护国家主权审判巴蒂斯塔罪犯的坚决措施。他说，这完全是古巴的内政，美国根本无权干涉。现在是东风压倒西风的时代，是民族独立运动蓬勃发展的时代，只要人民团结起来坚决斗争，帝国主义必然要遭到可耻的失败。
    著名建筑学家、清华大学建筑系主任梁思成说：古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的正义斗争，把美帝国主义纸老虎从屁股上给戳穿了。这场斗争再一次证明：尽做坏事、专门扶植各国反动派的美帝国主义者，是全世界人民的公敌。
    正在赶写反映中国人民大跃进剧本的作家老舍说：“拉丁美洲与非洲人民都在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的巨浪中怒吼起来，斗争起来！这个怒潮是无可抵挡的。”他相信古巴和刚果人民的正义斗争必定得到最后的胜利，并且表示坚决支持古巴和刚果人民的斗争。
    曾经访问过拉丁美洲的诗人萧三说：“我到过拉丁美洲的几个国家，也经过非洲大陆和海岸，如今听到古巴人民声势浩大、坚决勇敢的斗争和刚果人民的正义要求，就如同听到了从哈瓦那广场和刚果河畔发出的吼声，特别感到兴奋。我国人民同样经受过帝国主义和殖民主义强加在我们身上的苦难，因此对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各个国家、各个民族争取自由独立的斗争都寄予极大的同情，并且表示坚决的支持。”
    两年多以前到南美进行过访问演出的京剧演员李少春今天从报上看到古巴百万群众反美大示威的消息，心情十分激动。他说，他坚决相信古巴人民一定会击败美帝国主义的干涉，取得反帝斗争的最后胜利。
    新华社天津23日电　天津市各界人民坚决支持古巴和刚果人民的民族独立斗争。许多工厂、机关、学校和街道举行了座谈会、报告会，介绍古巴和刚果人民的斗争情况，参加会议的人一致谴责美帝国主义和比利时殖民主义者的罪行。
    在天津钢厂巨大的平炉旁，刚下班的天津市工业模范小组——齐子升小组的炼钢工人，和工程师一起举行了座谈会。炼钢工人赵凤来激愤地说：“我们中国人民过去和古巴、刚果人民一样，长期受着帝国主义的残酷统治和压迫。虽然中国人民和古巴、刚果人民远隔万里，但是我们保卫世界和平的心是一致的，我们反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争是共同的，我们坚决支持古巴和刚果人民。”工程师董振江说：“在东风压倒西风、全世界人民觉悟空前提高的时代里，古巴人民的正义斗争绝不是孤立的。美帝国主义支持巴蒂斯塔，支持世界上一切最脏最臭的渣滓和垃圾，到头来终将被全世界人民绞死。”
    天津市高等学校的教师和学生们也举行了许多座谈会，天津师范大学教授许忆痴说，“中国人民为古巴人民的胜利欢呼，为刚果人民的英勇斗争欢呼，我们坚决支持古巴、刚果人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争。”天津师范大学教育系二年级的学生们在座谈中表示坚决和古巴、刚果人民站在一起。他们指出：美帝国主义和比利时殖民主义者妄想镇压民族独立运动，必将遭受到惨败。
    兴安路的居民代表们举行的集会上，当场写了抗议书谴责美帝国主义和比利时殖民主义者的罪行。许多读者还写信给天津日报社，表示决心支持古巴、刚果人民的斗争。读者唐静等十二人给天津日报的信上说：“我们警告帝国主义者，你那条侵略的老路行不通了！”（附图片）
