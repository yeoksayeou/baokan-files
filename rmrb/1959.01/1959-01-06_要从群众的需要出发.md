    It is Necessary to Proceed from the Needs of the Masses
    Following the vigorous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a high tide of cultural revolution has been launched, setting off a wave of socialist singing unprecedented in history. I have personally witnessed many workers and peasants who had never written anything before, or who had just shed their illiteracy, enthusiastically creating folk songs. Many excellent folk singers have also composed many new lyrics, enthusiastically praising the Party and singing about the new life through their melodious and moving voices full of local flavor, making singing an important part of the cultural life of the masses.
    However, in my work, I have also deeply realized that it is natural for the masses to hope to sing their love for the socialist motherland with the words in their hearts, but in the greater leap forward in the new year, they also shoulder more important production tasks, and it is impossible to universally require them to set aside a lot of time to compose their own songs. However, some comrades excessively emphasize mass creation. They believe that the masses only need to sing the songs they write themselves, and they generally believe that the songs written by professional composers are not as good as those created by the masses, and do not put the power of professional composers in the appropriate position. I think that among the broad masses of workers and peasants, there are indeed many talented music enthusiasts. They live in the fiery struggle and are familiar with traditional and folk music forms. They are capable of creating beautiful songs. However, they are ultimately amateur enthusiasts, and their main task is production. In addition, they have no opportunity to receive more systematic guidance and training in this area, and their amateur creative activities will inevitably be subject to certain limitations. Therefore, we hope that while developing songs created by the masses, professional composers should also write more and better songs for the masses to meet their needs in musical life. Neglecting the role of professional composers is equivalent to neglecting the important significance of musical workers serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Facts have proved that the masses do not reject the songs composed by professional composers. For example, "Socialism is Good" and other mass songs written by professional composers have not been sung in every corner of China? Don’t men, women, old and young all love to sing them? The problem is that there are too few good songs like this. We have the right to ask composers to write more, newer, and more beautiful songs that the masses love to sing.
    In the socialist singing movement, I feel that the diverse singing styles that have emerged among the masses have indeed greatly enriched and enlivened their cultural life. However, I also disagree with what some comrades hope to achieve, "everyone sings"..., because people's energy is limited, and their hobbies are different. After a day of intense production and study, it is entirely necessary to widely carry out various cultural activities to adjust people's lives, but not everyone has to sing. If he likes to spend his spare time on other activities, doesn't it also enrich his life?
    I think that all kinds of mass amateur cultural activities are only truly required by the masses when they proceed from the needs and hobbies of the masses.

    要从群众的需要出发
    跟随着轰轰烈烈的工农业生产大跃进而来的文化革命高潮，掀起了一个历史上从来没有过的社会主义歌唱运动热潮。我亲眼见到不少从来没有写过东西，或者是刚摘掉文盲帽子的工农群众热情充沛地作起民歌来了。许多优秀的民间歌手，更是编写了不少新词，通过他们富有乡土情调和嘹亮动人的歌喉热烈地歌颂党，歌唱新生活，使歌唱成为群众文化生活中一个重要的组成部分。
    但是，我在工作中，也较深刻地体会到，群众希望用自己心里的话来歌唱他对社会主义祖国的热爱是很自然的，但在新的一年更大的跃进中，他们还担当着更为重要的生产任务，不可能普遍地要求他们腾出很多的时间为自己作歌子。可是，有一些同志却过分地强调了群众创作，他们以为群众只要唱自己编写的歌子，笼统地认为专业作曲家写的歌曲不如群众创作，不把专业作曲的力量放在适当的地位。我以为，广大的工农群众中，的确有不少富有才能的音乐爱好者，他们生活在火热的斗争生活中，又熟悉传统和民间的音乐形式，他们是能够创作出优美的歌子来的。然而，他们究竟是业余爱好者，他们的主要任务还是生产；加之他们没有机会比较系统的受到这一方面的指导和训练，在他们的业余创作活动中必然会受到一定的限制。因此，我们希望在发展群众创造的歌曲的同时，专业作曲家也要为群众写出更多更好的歌曲，来满足他们在音乐生活上的需要，忽视专业作曲家的作用，也就等于忽视音乐工作者必须为工农兵服务的重要意义。事实证明：群众并不是不欢迎专业作曲家所作的歌子，像“社会主义好”等专业作曲家写的群众歌曲，不是唱遍了全中国各个角落吗？不是男女老幼都爱唱吗？问题在于：像这样的好歌曲还太少，我们有权利要求作曲家们写出更多更新更美的、为广大群众爱唱的歌曲来。
    在社会主义歌唱运动中我觉得，群众中出现的多种多样的演唱方式，的确大大丰富和活跃了他们的文化生活。可是，我也不赞成某些同志所希望的要做到“人人唱歌”……，因为人的精力有限，爱好也不同，在一天的紧张生产、学习之余，广泛地开展各种文化活动来调剂人们的生活完全有必要，但并不一定每个人都要唱歌，如果他喜欢把业余时间花在其他活动上不也是同样丰富了生活内容吗？
    我想，各种群众性的业余文艺活动，只有真正从群众的需要和爱好出发，才是群众所要求的。
