Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 27th: Anhui Province's coal industry departments, based on summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year and after careful research, have formulated even greater Leap Forward targets for this year's coal production compared to last year, and have set out specific measures to achieve these targets. Last year, Anhui Province's coal production was equivalent to 1.7 times that of 1957.

Currently, the relevant provincial departments have determined that the development policy of the coal industry is: combining large, medium, and small sizes, combining indigenous and foreign methods, with a focus on foreign methods. On the one hand, vigorously grasp the production and construction work of large and medium-sized coal mines; on the other hand, use indigenous methods to start quickly and comprehensively develop small coal pits, and self-manufacture equipment to gradually convert small indigenous pits into small foreign pits, in order to reduce labor intensity and increase production capacity.

Under the guidance of this policy, the province will first vigorously focus on the production and construction work of the Huainan and Huaibei coal mines, striving to have eleven pairs of large and medium-sized mines put into production within the year.

Last year, the coal production of small coal pits in Anhui Province was more than three times that of 1957. A total of 1,475 new small coal pits were built throughout the year, and 449 were put into production. Through the exploitation of small coal pits, it has been found that more than 40 counties in the province have coal reserves. This year, the planned coal production of small coal pits will increase several times compared to last year. Therefore, it is required that all areas that can be mined should organize forces to vigorously mine. Existing small coal pits should adopt indigenous methods to carry out comprehensive technical transformation and key improvements, requiring that simple drainage, lifting, and other equipment be installed on all small coal pits by the first half of the year. While using indigenous methods to exploit small coal pits, it is necessary to select places with relatively abundant resources, shallow topsoil of coal seams, better coal quality, and convenient transportation to transform small coal pits into small foreign pits. In addition, it is planned to build, expand, and restore more than 100 pairs of small foreign pits with a designed capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 tons per year.

At present, all coal mine workers in the province are working harder to achieve new Leap Forward targets. From January 1st to 20th, some coal mining and tunneling teams in the Huainan Coal Mine exceeded their plans. Coal miners at the Liyingzi No. 3 well produced more than 7,000 tons of coal in twenty days; the average tunneling speed of tunneling workers at the Xieji集 No. 3 mine increased by about 50% compared to December last year. Several hundred small coal pits in the Wuhu area have launched a tool reform movement. The three counties of Xuancheng, Jingxian, and Guangde, where there are more small coal pits, have basically realized the railization of underground carts, the mechanization of lifting winches, and the use of pulleys for transporting coal and earth, eliminating the phenomenon of carrying by shoulders.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 27th: Guangxi's coal industry will have significant development this year.

According to the plan, Guangxi will build, continue to build, and renovate a total of 133 pairs of small inclined shafts and adits in the first quarter of this year. These coal mines will focus on the exploitation of coking coal and will adopt the method of simultaneous construction, installation, and production to ensure that they play their role as soon as possible. In the Fusu and Liucheng mining areas, which are rich in coal reserves and have coking coal, there are 68 newly built and renovated coal mines, of which 53 have already started construction.

In order to accelerate the construction of key coal bases, the autonomous region's machinery industry departments are also taking the method of self-reliance and mutual cooperation to rush to manufacture mining equipment. The employees of various machinery factories in Liuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin, who are responsible for the equipment for the Fusu coal mine with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 tons, are giving full play to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and ingenuity, and striving to manufacture the three main equipment items of ventilation, drainage, and lifting in February. In addition, Nanning City is also preparing to transfer a 500-kilowatt generator to support the construction of the Fusu coal mine.

While building new coal mines, Guangxi is also preparing to vigorously carry out technical transformation of small coal kilns. Most of these small coal kilns were established during last year's mass coal mining campaign. After technical transformation, the original situation of simple equipment, inconvenient transportation, large use of labor, and low output will be greatly changed. At present, Guangxi is taking the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods according to geological and transportation conditions to enhance the lifting, drainage, and ventilation equipment of small coal kilns; at the same time, through "three fixings" (fixing the location, fixing the personnel, fixing the leadership), the small coal kilns are undergoing production management rectification and consolidation work.

Driven by the policy of taking steel as the key link, Guangxi's coal industry had a leap forward development last year. A total of 755 new coal mines were built, and coal production increased more than ten times compared to 1952, powerfully supporting the production of steel and other industries. At the same time, through the mass coal mining campaign, geological workers were also helped to further understand the autonomous region's coal resources. At present, rich coal reserves have been discovered in 40 counties of the autonomous region, and some of the coal can be used for coking.

    安徽广西展开夺煤大战
    据新华社合肥27日电　安徽省煤炭工业部门在总结去年大跃进经验的基础上，经过细致的研究，制订了今年煤炭产量比去年增长更多的跃进指标，并定出了实现指标的具体措施。去年安徽省产煤量相当于1957年的一点七倍。
    现在，省有关部门已经确定煤炭工业的发展方针是：大、中、小结合，土洋结合，以洋为主。一方面大力抓紧大中型煤矿的生产和建设工作，一方面用土法上马，全面发展小煤井，并自制设备，逐渐把小土井改为小洋井，以减轻劳动强度，提高生产能力。
    在这个方针指导之下，全省将首先大力抓紧淮南、淮北两大煤矿的生产和建设工作，争取年内有十一对大、中型矿井投入生产。
    去年安徽省小煤井的煤产量为1957年的三倍多，全年新建小煤井一千四百七十五个，投入生产的有四百四十九个。通过开采小煤井，查明了全省有四十多个县蕴藏有煤。今年小煤井的产煤量计划比去年增长几倍。因此，要求凡是可以开采的地区，都要组织力量，大力开采。已开采的小煤井，要采取土办法进行全面的技术改造和重点提高，要求在上半年内在所有小煤井装置上简单的排水、提升等设备。在用土法开采小煤井的同时，要选择资源较丰富、煤层表土浅、煤质较好、交通便利的地方，把小煤井改造成为小洋井，另外再计划新建、扩建、恢复设计能力为年产五万到十万吨的小洋井一百多对。
    目前，全省煤矿职工正以更大干劲为实现新的跃进指标而努力。1月1日到20日，淮南煤矿一些采煤队和掘进队都超额完成了计划。李郢孜三号井采煤工人在二十天内多生产煤炭七千多吨；谢家集三矿掘进工人平均每天的掘进速度，比去年12月提高50％左右。芜湖专区几百个小煤井掀起了工具改革运动，小煤井较多的宣城、泾县、广德三个县，基本实现了井下车子轨道化，提升绞车绞盘化、运煤、运土滑车化，消灭了肩挑人抬现象。
    据新华社南宁27日电　广西煤炭工业今年将有很大的发展。
    按照计划，广西今年第一季度要新建、续建、改建的小型斜井、平洞共有一百三十三对。这批煤井将以开采焦煤为重点，并且采取边施工、边安装、边生产的办法，以保证其尽快发挥作用。在扶绥、柳城两个煤藏丰富并且有焦煤的矿区，新建、改建的煤井就有六十八对，其中有五十三对已经开始施工。
    为了加速重点煤炭基地的建设，自治区机械工业部门，也采取自力更生、互相协作的办法，正在加紧赶制矿井设备。柳州、南宁和桂林等市负责扶绥年产三万到五万吨煤井设备的各机械厂的职工，发挥苦干、实干、巧干的精神，力争在2月份制造出通风、排水、提升三项主要设备。此外，南宁市还准备抽调一台五百瓩的发电机，支援扶绥煤矿建设。
    在建设新煤井的同时，广西还准备对小煤窑大力进行技术改造工作。这些小煤窑大部分是在去年群众采煤运动中建立起来的，经过技术改造以后，将大大改变原来的设备简陋、运输不便、使用劳动力较多、产量较低的状况。目前，广西各地正在根据地质和交通运输等条件，采取土洋结合的办法，增强小煤窑的提升、排水、通风等设备；同时，通过“三定”（定点、定员、定领导），对小煤窑进行生产管理方面的整顿、巩固工作。
    在以钢为纲的方针带动下，去年广西煤炭工业有了飞跃的发展，全年共新建煤井七百五十五对，煤炭产量比1952年增长十倍多，有力地支援了钢铁和其他工业的生产。同时，通过群众采煤运动，还帮助地质工作人员对自治区的煤炭资源有了进一步的了解。目前，自治区已经有四十个县发现蕴藏丰富的煤，而且有一部分煤可以用来炼焦。
