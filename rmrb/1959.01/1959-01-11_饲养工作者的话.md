    Words from a Breeder
    After reading the People's Daily editorial on December 28th, "Vigorously Grasp the Production and Supply of Non-Staple Foods," we further realized the importance of providing better and more non-staple foods to the urban and rural people. We feel even more honored to be doing breeding work.
    The Party Central Committee instructs us to grasp production with one hand and livelihood with the other. The Party and Chairman Mao are always concerned about improving the living standards of the broad masses of people across the country. Under the leadership of the Party, we must redouble our efforts, work hard and skillfully, and do a good job in poultry breeding and raising, so that the people of the capital can eat more and better non-staple foods.

    饲养工作者的话
    我们读了12月28日人民日报社论“大抓副食品的生产和供应”，进一步认识到如何对城乡人民的副食品供应的更好些，生产的更多些，是很重要的任务。我们更感到做饲养工作是光荣的。
    党中央指示要一手抓生产、一手抓生活，党和毛主席时刻关心着全国广大人民生活水平的提高。在党的领导下，我们要鼓足更大干劲，苦干加巧干，做好家禽繁殖、饲养工作，让首都人民吃到更多更好的副食品。
