Iron and Steel Warriors Produce More and Better Steel and Iron
Key Enterprises Take the Lead
New Records Constantly Appear in Anshan, Shanghai, and Chongqing Steel Plants
(Our Anshan dispatch, 21st) Since New Year's Day, the hundreds of thousands of heroic iron and steel warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel have been attacking key production points with even greater enthusiasm to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's greater leap forward plan for the first quarter.
Many factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel have summarized their high-yield experience from last year, adopted practical measures focusing on key production areas, tapped potential, and pushed the production level in the first quarter of this year to a new peak. The national high-furnace king—Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 blast furnace—has implemented various production increase measures "to produce more and better iron." The three shifts of workers treated the furnace as their home, and the furnace front, furnace interior, and electromechanical mutual aid groups launched competitions. In recent weeks, they have achieved high production every day. From the 11th to the 17th, they exceeded the plan by 2,441 tons of pig iron in seven days. The workers of No. 11 open hearth furnace of the First Steelmaking Plant meticulously prepared in advance every day, and overproduced more than 260 tons of steel in the four days after New Year's Day. The average daily output increased by 44% compared with December last year. At the joint meeting of the four shifts, they summarized the four days of work and proposed a high-yield initiative to the brother open hearth furnaces. Because the First Medium Plate Plant concentrated its efforts on the rolling mill and adopted a series of measures such as fast rolling, fast repair, and fast replacement of rolls, it rolled more than 1,100 tons of high-quality steel plates for the country in the half month from January 1st to 15th.

(Our Shanghai dispatch, 21st) Since the beginning of this year, the steel plants in Shanghai have continued to exert their utmost efforts, focusing on both quality and quantity, both steelmaking and steel rolling, actively taking measures to strive to produce more and better steel and roll various types of steel.
After the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the workers and cadres of various steel plants in Shanghai widely discussed the communique of the Plenary Session. When analyzing this year's goal of 18 million tons of steel, everyone believed that this year not only should the quantity be large, but also the quality should be high and the variety should be diverse. This is a greater leap forward plan, and we must continue to exert our utmost efforts and work hard and cleverly. At the same time, the factories also summarized the experience of using local iron to make steel and rolling high-sulfur steel last year, promoted it, and generally carried out equipment maintenance.
After the discussion, the workers entered the new battle this year with full enthusiasm from the beginning, striving for a leap forward in both quality and quantity. In the first half of January, the No. 1 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 still used local iron with very high sulfur content. After adopting the method of two slag removals and soda ash desulfurization, the qualified rate of steel ingots increased to more than 98%, which was higher than the 6th and 7th months of last year when all good iron was used for steelmaking. The output also produced 634 tons of steel more than the original operating plan. The steel rolling workers of Shanghai Steel Plants No. 6 and No. 5 also launched a warm competition, creating many new records of high quantity and high quality.

(Our Chongqing dispatch, 21st) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company vigorously launched mass movements and unfolded a high-yield competition centered on grasping the quality of steel and steel materials.
Since entering January, the company's Party committee, in view of the fact that this year's production tasks were larger than last year's, the raw material for steelmaking, local iron, was more, and the sulfur content was higher, explained the current situation to all employees, handed over production tasks, and mobilized the masses to conduct great debates, further establishing the idea of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the minds of employees. Then, it widely mobilized employees to launch the "Three Reds" (Red in the first week, red in the first month, red in the first quarter) and "Five Goods" (good output, good quality, good safe production, good cost reduction, good cooperation) competition.
In order to further solve the problem of excessive sulfur content in local iron and shorten the smelting time, the company's Party committee organized working groups to go deep into the steelmaking workshops to plant "experimental fields," carefully studied the experience in this area, and at the same time, each steelmaking workshop adopted an effective method combining leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers to find solutions. From the 1st to the 14th, the average qualified rate of steel ingots in the small open hearth furnace workshop reached 96.16%, and the large open hearth furnace workshop reached 82.57%. The qualified rate of various steel products was above 99%, and most were first-class products.

Increase Small Native Furnaces; Build Small Modern Furnaces
Xinyang Prefecture's Output of Good Iron Rises
According to Henan Daily, the Xinyang Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Party Committee and a meeting of industrial secretaries of various counties to specifically discuss and deploy the steel production tasks for 1959 and the first quarter. After the prefecture and county Party committees took various measures, the output of high-quality iron in the entire region increased, and by the 15th, it had reached a daily output of 106 tons of high-quality iron.
In order to complete this year's leap forward plan for steel production, the Xinyang Prefectural Party Committee decided to focus on ideological work, and at the same time, determined to quickly finalize the leadership and personnel of all the existing small native groups in the region on the basis of determining the location, factory, and furnace type, strengthen planning management, establish and improve various systems, and implement economic accounting and cost management. And vigorously promote the improved Yangcheng furnace, the big-bellied furnace, and the Shangcheng-style native blast furnace. So that the entire region has 1,093 excellent native blast furnaces and 119 three-cubic-meter blast furnaces, and regularly maintains 400 furnaces in production, with an average daily output of 302 tons of good iron; it is also necessary to focus on the construction of modern furnaces, and newly build 24 twenty-eight-cubic-meter blast furnaces, and strive to put them into production before the end of March.
In order to improve steel output and quality, the Xinyang area is vigorously reducing the proportion of coke, requiring the average native blast furnace to reach a ratio of one to two (white coal), and the modern furnace to reach a standard of one to one point five (coke). In smelting and mining, take the "eight-izations" as the content (semi-mechanization of mining, semi-mechanization of ore dressing, vehicle transportation, semi-mechanization of charging, ore roasting, hot air heating of the furnace, gray pig iron of native furnace, production safety), and set off a mass technical innovation upsurge.

Use Simple Instruments; Implement Scientific Management
Anhui's "Small Modern Groups" Take Another Step Forward
(Our dispatch) In the process of consolidating and improving the steel "small modern groups," Anhui Province is actively promoting the use of simple instruments for blast furnaces to ensure the normal production of small modern blast furnaces and produce more and better iron.
Anhui Province has built and is building more than 1,100 small modern blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more, and 801 have been put into production. In order to manage these small modern blast furnaces well with scientific methods, various places are promoting several simple instruments used by the steel plant of the provincial directly affiliated finance and trade system. These simple instruments include a cold air flowmeter and a cold air pressure gauge installed on the cold air pipe, a hot air flowmeter, a hot air pressure gauge, and a hot air temperature gauge installed on the hot air pipe, a gas pressure gauge installed on the gas main, and a furnace top thermometer. People can judge the production situation inside the furnace according to these instruments, ensure normal production, and ensure and improve the quality of pig iron. For example, the No. 12 blast furnace of the steel plant of the provincial directly affiliated finance and trade system found three hanging charges within two days after the furnace was started because the furnace was not baked well and the furnace charge was too wet. Because the problem was discovered early from the instruments, measures were taken in time without affecting normal production. The iron output of the No. 5 furnace of this plant once dropped from about 1,000 kilograms to more than 100 kilograms. After the instrument was installed, it was found that the hot blast stove was leaking too much air. After repairing the hot blast stove, the furnace's iron output returned to about 1,000 kilograms.

    奥托·格罗提渥同志为完成1800万吨钢发挥冲天干劲和聪明才智
    钢铁战士生产更多好钢好铁
    重点企业一马当先
    鞍山、上海、重庆钢厂新纪录不断出现
    本报鞍山21日电　元旦以来，鞍钢十几万英雄的钢铁战士，以更大的干劲，攻打生产关键，保证超额完成今年第一季度更大的跃进计划。
    鞍钢的许多厂矿都总结了去年高产经验，围绕生产关键采取切实措施，挖掘潜力，把今年第一季度生产水平推向新的高峰。全国高炉王——鞍钢十号高炉为“多出铁，出好铁”，实现了各项增产措施。三班职工以炉为家，炉前、炉内和机电互助组展开竞赛，最近一星期连日高产，从11日到17日，七天共超过计划增产二千四百四十一吨生铁。第一炼钢厂十一号平炉的工人，每天都细致地提前做好准备工作，元旦后四天就超产钢二百六十多吨，平均日产量比去年12月增长44％。在四班联席会议上，他们总结了四天工作，并向各兄弟平炉提出高产倡议。第一中板厂由于全厂集中力量在轧钢机上采取了快轧、快修、快换轧辊等一系列措施，从元月1日到15日的半个月，为国家多轧了一千一百多吨优质钢板。
    本报上海21日电　上海市各钢铁厂今年以来继续鼓足干劲，既抓质量又抓产量，既抓炼钢，又抓轧钢，积极采取措施，争取炼出更多更好的钢，轧出多种多样的钢材。
    在党的八届六中全会以后，上海各钢铁厂工人和干部广泛讨论了全会的公报，在分析今年一千八百万吨钢的奋斗目标时，大家认为：今年不仅数量要大而且质量要高，品种要多，这是一个更大的跃进计划，必须继续鼓足干劲，苦干巧干。与此同时，各厂还总结了去年用土铁炼钢和轧制高硫钢的经验，加以推广，并普遍进行设备检修。
    经过讨论以后，工人们投入今年新的战斗时，一开始就劲头十足，力争质量和数量一起跃进。上钢三厂第一转炉车间，1月上半月用的土铁含硫仍然很高，他们采取两次造渣、纯碱去硫的办法后，钢锭合格率提高到98％以上，比去年全部用好铁炼钢的6、7月份还高。产量也比原定的作业计划多炼了六百三十四吨钢。上钢六厂、五厂轧钢工人们也掀起热烈的竞赛，创造了不少量多质高的新纪录。
    本报重庆21日电　重庆钢铁公司大搞群众运动，展开以抓钢和钢材的质量为中心的高产竞赛。
    进入1月份以来，这个公司的党委针对今年公司的生产任务比去年大、炼钢的原料土铁多、含硫高等情况，向全公司职工讲清目前形势，交代生产任务，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，在职工思想上进一步树立更大更好更全面跃进的思想，然后广泛发动职工展开“三红”（第一周红、第一月红、第一季红）、“五好”（产量好、质量好、安全生产好、降低成本好、协作好）竞赛。
    为了进一步解决土铁含硫过高的问题和缩短冶炼时间，公司的党委组织工作组深入炼钢车间种“试验田”，认真研究这方面的经验，同时各个炼钢车间都采用了领导干部、工程技术人员和工人三结合有效的方式，找出解决办法。1日至14日，小平炉车间的钢锭质量合格率平均达到96.16％，大平炉车间达到82.57％。各种钢材的合格率都在99％以上，大多数是一级品。
    提高小土炉　建设小洋炉
    信阳专区好铁产量上升
    据河南日报消息　中共信阳地委最近先后召开了地委扩大会议与各县工业书记会议，具体讨论部署了1959年和第一季度的钢铁生产任务。经过地、县委采取了各种措施后，全区优质铁的产量上升，到15日已日产优质铁一百零六吨。
    为了完成今年钢铁生产跃进计划，信阳地委决定抓好思想工作，同时确定把全区已有的小土群在定好点、厂及炉型的基础上，迅速把领导和人员定下来，加强计划管理，建立与健全各项制度，实行经济核算与成本管理。并大力推广改良式的阳城炉、大肚炉和商城式土高炉。使全区拥有优良土高炉一千零九十三座，三立方公尺高炉一百一十九座，经常保持有四百座炉子投入生产，平均日产好铁三百零二吨；还要抓好洋炉建设，新建二十八立方公尺高炉二十四座，争取在3月底前投入生产。
    为了提高钢铁产量与质量，信阳地区正大力降低焦炭的比例，要求土高炉平均达到一比二（白煤），洋炉子达到一比一点五（焦炭）标准。在冶炼、采矿方面以“八化”为内容（采矿半机械化，选矿半机械化，运输车子化，上料半机械化，矿石焙烧化，炉子热风化，土炉灰生铁化，生产安全化），掀起群众性技术革新高潮。
    使用简单仪表　实行科学管理
    安徽“小洋群”又提高一步
    本报讯　安徽省在巩固和提高钢铁“小洋群”的过程中，积极推广高炉使用的简单仪表，保证小洋高炉正常生产，多出铁，出好铁。
    安徽省已经建成和正在兴建的八立方公尺以上的小洋高炉有一千一百多个，投入生产的有八百零一个。为了把这些小洋高炉用科学的方法管理好，各地正在推广省直属财贸系统钢铁厂采用的几种简单仪表。这些简单仪表，有安装在冷风管上的冷风风量计、冷风压力计，有安装在热风管上的热风风量计、热风压力计、热风风温计，有安装在煤气总管上的煤气压力计和炉顶温度计等。人们可以根据这些仪表判断炉内生产情况，保证正常生产，保证和提高生铁质量。如省直属财贸系统钢铁厂的十二号高炉，因为炉没有烘好，炉料太潮，开炉后两天内就发现三次悬料，由于从仪表上及早发现问题，及时采取措施，没有影响正常生产。这个厂五号炉的出铁量一度曾由一千公斤左右降到一百多公斤，在装上仪表以后，发现是热风炉跑风过多，修理了热风炉，炉的出铁量又回升到一千公斤左右。（附图片）
