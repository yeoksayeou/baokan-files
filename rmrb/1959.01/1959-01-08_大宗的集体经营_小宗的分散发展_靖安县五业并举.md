    Collective Management of Large-Scale Operations, Decentralized Development of Small-Scale Operations
    Jing'an County Promotes Five Industries Simultaneously
    (Our report) Jing'an County, a mountainous area in Jiangxi Province, while focusing on grain crops in 1958, paid attention to the comprehensive development of agricultural production, enabling agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries to flourish. According to investigations and accounting, in 1958, the county not only doubled its total grain output compared to 1957, with the per-unit area yield exceeding the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program, reaching 816 jin; the tending and felling of trees and bamboo also exceeded the state plan. In terms of livestock and poultry, in addition to fulfilling the state task of transferring pigs, the current number of pigs in stock has doubled compared to the same period in 1957, and the current number of chickens and ducks has increased by 1.6 times compared to the same period in 1957. In the past, there was no fish farming tradition here, but in 1958, all perennial reservoirs and ponds were used for fish farming, producing 530 dan of fresh fish. In addition, the county also opened up a wide range of sideline production channels, managing more than 100 kinds of other native paper, pulp, shiitake mushrooms, charcoal burning, medicinal materials, and local specialties. The development of multiple economic sectors not only strongly supported national industrial construction and market needs but also greatly increased the income of the communes. By mid-December 1958, the income from forestry and sideline occupations in the county had reached 3.6 million yuan, averaging more than 26 yuan per commune member. Therefore, each commune has sufficient production funds, allowing members to receive pocket money every month.
    Jing'an County has grasped both grain production and achieved all-round development of multiple economic sectors, mainly by focusing on the following key aspects:
    In the spring of 1958, the County Party Committee convened meetings of Party Committee and branch secretaries from various townships and communes, as well as a series of cadre meetings. By calculating three accounts (income and expenditure account, account of supporting national construction and social needs, and labor account), cadres were made to realize the importance of developing multiple economic sectors and to establish a comprehensive leap-forward perspective.
    Party committees at all levels, while not relaxing grain production, especially strengthened their leadership over multiple economic sectors. The County Committee specifically established a Forestry and Sideline Production Office, led by a deputy secretary of the County Party Committee.
    The county's large-scale forestry and sideline occupations, such as timber, bamboo, pulp, papermaking, charcoal burning, shiitake mushroom cultivation, medicinal material digging, pig raising, and fish farming, can only be easily coordinated and arranged in terms of labor force through collective management. Therefore, these projects have adopted a form of collective management as the main method, with communes and teams managing them at different levels, establishing various perennial professional teams and groups, and assigning responsibilities according to technical expertise and labor strength. Because forestry and some sideline occupations, such as timber harvesting and transportation, and the cutting of bamboo and ramie for papermaking, are highly seasonal and have large tasks, a "large-scale troop" collaboration and concentrated effort method is adopted at this time, seizing the agricultural gap and mobilizing the whole population to complete them. For example, in the spring, the county took advantage of the spring flood season to concentrate on transporting timber rafts and engaging in large-scale bamboo ramie and pulp production; in late summer and early autumn, when trees are easy to peel, which is beneficial for forest land renewal, the county concentrated on cutting timber; in autumn and winter, when there is less agricultural work, the county concentrated on transporting bamboo and wood from the mountains to the streams by shoulder and collecting wild plants, burning charcoal, and digging medicinal materials.
    After the realization of communization, while ensuring collective management, each commune still allows commune members to continue to engage in some small-scale household sideline occupations, such as livestock and poultry raising, and helps them solve the difficulties of feed. Now, in addition to the collective pig farms, chicken farms, and duck farms run by communes and production teams, many commune members themselves raise a meat pig. In 1958, each household of commune members raised an average of 13 chickens and ducks, more than doubling the number in 1957.

    大宗的集体经营　小宗的分散发展
    靖安县五业并举
    本报讯　江西省山区的靖安县1958年在大抓粮食作物的同时，注意了农业生产的全面发展，使农林牧副渔“五花”齐开并茂。根据调查核算，1958年这个县不仅粮食总产量比1957年翻一番，单位面积产量跨过农业发展纲要所规定的指标，达到了八百一十六斤；林木、毛竹的抚育和采伐也都超额完成了国家计划；家畜家禽方面，生猪除上调完成国家任务以外，现存栏数比1957年同期增加一倍，现有鸡鸭比1957年同期增加一点六倍；过去这里没有养鱼的习惯，1958年所有常年蓄水的水库、水塘都养了鱼，出产了鲜鱼五百三十担。此外，还广开副业生产门路，经营的其他土纸、纸浆、香菇、烧炭、药材和土特产等共一百多种。由于多种经济的发展，不仅有力地支援了国家工业建设和市场需要，同时使公社收入大大增加。到1958年12月中旬止，全县林副业的收入已达三百六十万元，按人口计算平均每个社员可分二十六元多。因此，每个公社都有较充足的生产资金，并使社员每个月都能支取到零用钱。
    靖安县既抓了粮食，又取得了多种经济的全线发展，主要是抓住了以下几个环节：
    1958年春季县委召开了各乡、社党委、支部书记会议和一系列的干部会议，通过算三笔账（收入支出账、支援国家建设和社会需要账、劳力账）的办法，使干部认识到发展多种经济的重要性，树立起全面跃进的观点。
    各级党委在不放松粮食生产的前提下，特别加强了对多种经济的领导。县委会专门成立了林副业生产办公室，由一个县委副书记亲自挂帅指挥。
    全县大宗的林副业如木材、毛竹、纸浆、造纸、烧炭、作香菇、挖药材、养猪、养鱼等，只有集体经营才便于统一调配和安排劳动力。因此，对这些项目采取了以集体经营为主的形式，并实行社、队分级管理，建立各种常年性的专业队、组，按技术专长、劳力强弱分工负责。因为林业和部分副业如木材采伐、放运、造纸原料竹麻的砍伐等，季节性很强，任务又大，这时就采取“大兵团”协作突击的办法，抓住农业空隙全民动员突击完成。如春季即趁春汛突击放运木排，大搞竹麻、纸浆；夏末秋初树木容易剥皮，对林地更新有利，即突击砍伐木材；秋冬两季农事较少，即突击由山上肩运竹木到溪边和采集野生植物、烧木炭、挖药材。
    实现公社化以后，在保证集体经营的前提下，各公社仍允许社员个人继续经营一些家庭小副业，如家畜和家禽等，并帮助其解决饲料的困难。现在除公社和生产队经营的集体养猪场、养鸡和养鸭场外，许多社员自己都喂有一头肉猪。1958年每户社员平均养鸡养鸭十三只，比1957年增加一倍多。
