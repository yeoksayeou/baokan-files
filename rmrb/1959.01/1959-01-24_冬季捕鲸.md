    Winter Whaling
    The No. 1 whaling ship of the Lüda Aquatic Products Company broke the convention of only going to sea for whaling in the spring, and is conducting winter whaling in the nearby sea.
    The whaling ship has already caught two fin whales, weighing 50,000 and 90,000 jin respectively. The harpooner who hit these two whales is a young whaler who has been on the ship for less than three years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
