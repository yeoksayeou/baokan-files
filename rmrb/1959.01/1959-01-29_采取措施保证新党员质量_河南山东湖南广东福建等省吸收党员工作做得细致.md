Take Measures to Guarantee the Quality of New Party Members
Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian and Other Provinces are Meticulous in Absorbing Party Members

    (Based on our report) The CPC organizations in Henan, Shandong, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian and other provinces have adopted many effective measures in the work of admitting party members to ensure the quality of new party members, especially in conducting meticulous organizational and ideological education work before admission. Therefore, most of the newly admitted party members meet the higher and stricter standards of party members.

    Under the new situation of the all-round great leap forward in socialist construction, the Party organizations of these provinces have planned to admit a number of activists with high communist consciousness and soaring enthusiasm who emerged in the great leap forward, in order to better ensure the completion of various Party tasks. Most of the new party members developed by the Henan Provincial Party organization are leading cadres on the people's communes and the iron and steel front, and many are models on various fronts. According to statistics from the three counties of Songxian, Huixian, and Anyang, among the 1,522 new party members admitted, 914 were various models. More than 97% of the 1,400 new party members admitted by the four counties of Xiangxiang, Suining, Xinning, and Xinshao in Hunan Province were originally backbones of agricultural cooperatives. Anle People's Commune in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, admitted 168 new party members last year, of which 155 were rated as models by the commune. Zheng Yimei, a new party member admitted by the Party organization of Weixing People's Commune in Changle County, Fujian Province, has been rated as a model seven times in agricultural production. During the mass campaign to make steel, she actively mobilized women to participate in burning charcoal and washing iron sand, successfully completing the task and receiving first-class merit.

    In order to ensure the quality of new party members, the Party organizations of these provinces have undergone a relatively long period of preparation before developing new party members, and have conducted meticulous ideological education and organizational work. Some grassroots Party organizations in Shandong Province have closely integrated with the central work, selected and trained a large number of activists through activities such as formulating red and expert plans and carrying out production appraisals and competitions; at the same time, they have also adopted the method of running amateur Party schools on a large scale, using construction sites, factories, and fields as classrooms, to conduct serious education on basic Party knowledge for activists. The Party organizations at all levels in Henan Province, in conjunction with the central work, have cultivated 2.4 million red and expert activists, and have established more than 5,000 amateur Party schools, absorbing 300,000 activists to study the Party program, the Party Constitution, the Party's mass line, and current affairs policies. Party organizations in Fujian, Hunan and other provinces have also adopted the method of assigning Party members to contract tasks, with Party members going deep into furnace sides, mine pits, charcoal kilns, fields and classrooms to implement contracted education, contracted inspection, contracted development and contracted quality for activists. In addition to educating activists, Party organizations in various places also planned to assign them to take the lead in completing some arduous tasks, so that they would be strictly tested and tempered in actual life.

    Conducting a comprehensive and serious review of each development target and strictly following the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution to admit new party members is the key to effectively ensuring the quality of new party members. Party organizations especially emphasized the importance of comprehensive inspection of the development targets, and should not only look at temporary and isolated performances. When admitting new party members, Party organizations in Henan, Shandong, Hunan and other provinces seriously performed three procedures, that is, the introducer made a serious and comprehensive introduction, the branch general assembly seriously discussed, and the Party committee seriously reviewed and approved. Some places also absorbed non-Party masses to participate in the discussion and admission of new Party members to listen to their opinions.

    In order to effectively ensure the quality of new party members, Shandong and Henan provinces have also proposed to block various loopholes that may reduce the quality of party members. Shandong Province stipulates that the work of developing new party members must be carried out on the basis of thorough rectification. Regions and units where rectification is not deep or thorough will not admit new party members for the time being. Henan Province stipulates that in some backward areas and backward units, new party members will generally not be developed for the time being until the backward situation has been changed. These regulations are very necessary to ensure the quality of new party members.

    Because Party organizations at all levels pay attention to ensuring the quality of new party members in Party building work, and at the same time pay attention to admitting new party members in places where the Party's strength was originally relatively weak, this further strengthened the Party's leading role in grassroots work. The Yaoti Production Team of Jingang People's Commune in Changde County, Hunan Province, originally had no Party members, and was backward in five of the seven production appraisals. Since a group of outstanding members were admitted to the Party and a grassroots Party organization was established, the work has taken on a new look, winning first place in every one of the six appraisals. The Party organizations at all levels in Henan Province have admitted a group of new Party members among the staff of the public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens of the people's communes, greatly strengthening the Party's leadership over these collective welfare undertakings. The Guangdong Provincial Party organization also admitted a group of new Party members in the urban service industry. In the service industry in Guangzhou, nearly 2,000 outstanding members have joined the Communist Party of China, including shop assistants, tea house and hotel waiters, and hairdressers. They are engaged in the noble labor of "serving people." The development of the Party organization has greatly strengthened the Party's leadership over these departments. In addition, Party organizations in various places also paid attention to admitting some outstanding people into the Party among senior intellectuals.

    采取措施保证新党员质量
    河南山东湖南广东福建等省吸收党员工作做得细致
    本报讯　河南、山东、湖南、广东、福建等省的中共组织在接收党员工作中，采取了许多有效的措施来保证新党员的质量，特别是在接收之前进行了细致的组织工作和思想教育工作，因而使接收的新党员大都符合于更高更严的党员标准。
    这几个省的党组织在社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的新形势下，为了更好地保证完成党的各项工作任务，都有计划地接收了一些大跃进中涌现出的有较高的共产主义觉悟和冲天干劲的积极分子入党。河南省党组织发展的新党员，大部分都是人民公社和钢铁战线上的领导骨干、许多人还是各个战线上的模范。据嵩县、辉县、安阳三个县接收的一千五百二十二名新党员的统计，其中有各种模范九百一十四名。湖南省湘乡、绥宁、新宁、新邵四个县接收的一千四百多名新党员，原农业社的骨干占97％以上。广东省揭阳县安乐人民公社去年接收了一百六十八名新党员，其中有一百五十五人被公社评为模范。福建省长乐县卫星人民公社党组织接收的新党员郑依媄，在农业生产中曾七次被评为模范；在全民大炼钢铁运动中，她又积极发动妇女参加烧木炭、洗铁砂，出色地完成了任务，立了一等功。
    为了保证新党员的质量，这几个省的党组织在发展新党员以前都经过了较长时间的准备，进行了细致的思想教育工作和组织工作。山东省一些基层党组织紧密结合中心工作，通过制订红专规划、开展生产评比竞赛等活动，挑选和培养了大批积极分子；同时又采取大办业余党校的方式，以工地、工厂、田间为课堂，对积极分子认真进行了有关党的基础知识的教育。河南省各级党组织结合中心工作，培养了二百四十万名红专积极分子，举办了五千多所业余党校，吸收三十万名积极分子学习了党纲党章、党的群众工作路线和时事政策等。福建、湖南等省的党组织还采取党员分工包干的办法，由党员深入炉边、矿坑、炭窑、田间和课堂，对积极分子实行包教育、包考察、包发展、包质量。除了向积极分子进行教育以外，各地党组织还有计划地分配他们带头去完成一些艰巨的任务，使他们在实际生活中受到严格的考验和锻炼。
    对每一个发展对象都进行全面、认真的审查，并严格地按照党章规定的手续接收新党员，是切实保证新党员质量的关键。党的组织特别强调要重视对发展对象的全面考察，不能只看一时一事的表现。河南、山东、湖南等省的党组织在接收新党员时，都认真履行了三道手续，即介绍人认真全面介绍，支部大会认真讨论，党委认真审查批准。有的地方在讨论接收新党员时，还吸收非党群众参加，听取他们的意见。
    为了切实保证新党员的质量，山东、河南两省还提出要堵塞各种可能降低党员质量的漏洞。山东省规定发展新党员工作必须在整风已经深透的基础上进行，凡是整风不深不透的地区和单位，暂时都不接收新党员。河南省规定对于某些落后的地区和落后的单位，在没有改变落后状况以前，一般暂时不发展新党员。这些规定对保证新党员的质量是非常必要的。
    由于各级党组织在建党工作中注意保证新党员的质量，同时又注意在党的力量原来比较薄弱的地方接收新党员，这就进一步加强了党在基层工作中的领导作用。湖南省常德县金钢人民公社腰堤生产队，原来没有党员，七次生产评比就有五次落后。自从接收了一批优秀分子入党并建立了党的基层组织以后，工作面貌焕然一新，六次评比每次都得了第一。河南省各级党组织在人民公社的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的工作人员中接收了一批新党员，大大加强了党对这些集体福利事业的领导。广东省党组织还在城市服务性行业中接收了一批新党员。在广州市的服务性行业中，有近两千名优秀分子加入了中国共产党，其中有商店售货员、茶楼酒店的服务员和理发员等，他们从事着“侍候人”的崇高劳动，党的组织的发展，使党对这些部门的领导有了很大的加强。除此以外，各地党组织还注意在高级知识分子中吸收了一部分优秀人物入党。
