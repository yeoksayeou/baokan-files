    "Four Fixes and One Reward" Production Responsibility System
    The CCP Suixian County Committee Work Group
    The Hongxing People's Commune in Suixian County, Henan Province, implemented a production responsibility system of unified leadership, decentralized management, and "four fixes and one reward" (fixing production targets, fixing investment, fixing delivery quotas, fixing measures for increased production, and rewarding overproduction), resulting in rapid development of various socialist construction undertakings. The commune's labor attendance rate increased from 92.6% to 112%, and labor efficiency increased by 1.2 times. According to a 41-day statistic, the commune newly manufactured and modified 126 types of tools, totaling 1,403 pieces. The rapid kiln firing method created by the First Brick and Tile Kiln saved 12,000 yuan and 1,380 workdays in one month. The sewing factory invented a shoe sole cutting machine, which allows one person to cut 180 pairs a day, increasing efficiency by 20 times compared to manual cutting. Before implementing the "four fixes and one reward," the comprehensive iron factory made a profit of 5,700 yuan per month; after implementing the "four fixes and one reward," the monthly profit was more than 12,600 yuan. The commune's 18,000 laborers spent only two days pulling flower stalks from 25,000 mu of land, accumulating 2.8 million jin of fertilizer, and applying topdressing to 18,000 mu of wheat fields. Production management must adapt to the leaping progress situation.
    After the establishment of this commune, the original production management system could not fully adapt to the needs of the leaping progress situation due to changes in organizational forms, production relations, business scope, and distribution system. In order to improve management level, the Party Committee and Management Committee, based on the principle of democratic centralism, the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, and the planning requirements of the county joint cooperative, combined with the specific conditions of the commune, initially determined that: the commune would implement the "four fixes and one reward" system for management areas and the factories and stations under their jurisdiction; the management areas would implement "three fixes" for production teams; and professional teams and groups would implement "three fixes" for commune members. This changed the original production management system and established a production responsibility system at each level.
    The decentralized management and "four fixes and one reward" production responsibility system of the Hongxing People's Commune were implemented on the basis of debate and unified thinking from bottom to top and from top to bottom. Initially, some cadres and masses were unclear about the benefits of implementing the production responsibility system. Production team leader Zhang Zhenzhong said, "Whether the four fixes or three fixes are implemented or not, production is the same; we just hand over whatever we harvest." In order to unify thinking and understanding, the commune held a series of meetings to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization. By examining the situation and tasks, examining the role of the "three guarantees" (guaranteed work, guaranteed production, and guaranteed investment), examining the achievements of production management and the existing problems, the commune organized a great debate on the topics of "Is it beneficial to production to implement the 'four fixes and one reward' production responsibility system?" and "How to implement the 'four fixes and one reward' production responsibility system?" Through debate, everyone believed that implementing the "four fixes and one reward" and "three fixes and one reward" had five major advantages: First, it could better integrate the commune's plans with the state's plans; second, it more specifically solved the scope of responsibility for unified management and decentralized management; third, it greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of cadres and commune members to complete tasks; fourth, it facilitated the strengthening of production planning and labor and financial management; fifth, it could comprehensively improve production and ensure the quality of work.
    On the basis of unifying understanding and raising awareness, the commune formulated a plan for the "four fixes and one reward" system. The method of formulation was to first put forward a preliminary plan for the "four fixes and one reward" system by the Commune Party Committee and the Commune Management Committee, then implement it through the congress of commune member representatives, party member, league member and cadre meetings and commune member mass meetings, widely absorbing the opinions of grassroots cadres and commune members, and carry out a mass airing of views, big contending and big debate. After five days of airing views and debate, a total of 41,800 big-character posters were written, and 82,000 suggestions were made, which greatly enriched the content of the "four fixes and one reward" system. Finally, it was modified and finalized through the congress of commune member representatives. After the plan was finalized, contracts were signed, a mobilization rally was held, and labor competitions were launched between management areas and between factories.
      How to Implement the "Four Fixes and One Reward" System
    The decentralized management and "four fixes and one reward" production responsibility system of the Hongxing People's Commune were implemented on the basis of adjusting land, livestock, labor, leading backbone, and organization. In accordance with the principles of being conducive to developing production and conducive to consolidating and improving the commune, more than 9,000 mu of land were adjusted between management areas and production teams, and more than 20 head of livestock were exchanged. Adjustments and plans were also made for leading backbone and labor engaged in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and collective welfare undertakings. On this basis, the commune, based on business scope, production capacity, and other conditions, and through comprehensive planning, specifically formulated the "four fixes and one reward" system.
    Fixing Production Targets: The determination of agricultural production targets was based on the quality of the soil, water conservancy equipment, and other conditions, appropriately referring to the actual output of previous years, and adopting a method of zonal unified mixed grading. The commune's eight management areas classified food crops into three grades and then subdivided the grades according to different crops. For example, the first management area had more two-combine land and good alluvial land, suitable for planting cotton and grain, so planting cotton and grain crops were both first-grade areas; but planting peanuts and oil crops were second-grade areas. The second management area was all green sandy land, suitable for planting oil crops, so oil crops were a first-grade area, and grain was a third-grade area. The production targets for various crops throughout the commune were assigned to each unit. The method of allocation was: first, the Commune Party Committee and the Management Committee put forward preliminary opinions on the production targets of each production unit, then each production unit put forward revisions, and finally the congress of commune member representatives was convened to discuss and finalize the plan. Industrial and sideline production targets were determined in accordance with the principle of vigorously developing local industry, actively developing diversified operations, and vigorously developing commodity production.
    Fixing Investment: In accordance with the principle of "running the commune diligently and thriftily, and supporting production," the total amount of production investment in the commune was 5 million yuan, of which 2 million yuan was for agricultural investment, 1.5 million yuan for industrial and sideline investment, 200,000 yuan for forestry investment, 300,000 yuan for animal husbandry investment, 100,000 yuan for commercial investment, and the remaining 900,000 yuan was used as mobile and other investment.
    Fixing Delivery Quotas: All products produced by each production unit were uniformly distributed by the commune. In order to reduce procedures, the delivery quotas could be calculated after offsetting the above two provisions. The commune's delivery quota was 13 million yuan, accounting for 32% of the total income.
    Fixing Measures for Increased Production: In agricultural production, the commune required the management areas to thoroughly realize advanced garden-style farming, change the extensive cultivation system, increase fertilizer application, rationally plant densely, thoroughly eliminate pests and diseases, strengthen field management, and realize agricultural mechanization. The measures for increasing industrial and sideline production were: putting politics in command, secretaries taking action, mobilizing the whole people, vigorously developing local industry and diversified operations, and conscientiously implementing the "small indigenous groups" policy. The forestry production measure was to implement a dedicated person responsible system for who plants, who manages, guarantees planting and guarantees survival. Commercial and animal husbandry production also set out major measures to increase production, so as to effectively ensure the completion of various production tasks.
    On this basis, the management area also implemented a "three fixes and one reward" (fixing production targets, fixing investment, fixing measures to increase production, rewarding overproduction) system for the production team and its subordinate units. The production team implemented five fixes for specialized production groups (fixing leadership, fixing labor, fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing time), and the specialized group implemented three fixes for commune members (fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing time).
    Reward System: The commune rewarded overproducing units that actively produced, had strong measures, and were well managed by extracting 40% of the overproduced portion, which was used by the overproducing unit as funds for expanding reproduction and developing welfare undertakings. 60% was turned over to the commune, and the commune then extracted 40% of the overproduction turnover as bonuses for various grassroots production units. The commune also gave rewards to commune members who overfulfilled production tasks, and the bonuses were controlled by the management area. Units or individuals who did not complete their tasks were given appropriate criticism and were not given material punishment.

    “四定一奖”生产责任制
    中共睢县县委工作组
    河南睢县红星人民公社实行统一领导，分级管理和“四定一奖”（定生产指标、定投资、定上交任务、定增产措施和超产奖励）的生产责任制度，各项社会主义建设事业迅速发展。全社劳动出勤率由92.6％增加到112％，劳动效率提高一点二倍。据四十一天统计，全社共新制和改制一百二十六种、一千四百零三件工具。第一砖瓦窑场创造的快速烧窑法，一个月就节约一万二千元，省工一千三百八十个。缝纫厂创造裁鞋底机，一个人一天可裁一百八十双，较以前人工裁效率提高二十倍。综合铁工厂未实行“四定一奖”前一个月获利润五千七百元，实行“四定一奖”后，一月获利一万二千六百多元。全社一万八千个劳力只两天时间就拔花柴二万五千亩，积肥二百八十万斤，麦田追肥一万八千亩。生产管理必须适应跃进形势
    这个社建成后由于组织形式、生产关系、经营范围、分配制度的变化，原有的生产管理制度就不能完全适应跃进形势的需要。党委会和管理委员会为了提高管理水平，根据民主集中制的原则，工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，以及县联社的计划要求，结合本社的具体情况，初步研究确定：公社对管理区和所辖的厂、站，实行“四定一奖”制；管理区对生产队实行“三定”；专业队、组对社员实行“三定”。改变了原来的生产管理制度，逐级建立了生产责任制。
    红星人民公社的分级管理和“四定一奖”生产责任制，是在自下而上、自上而下层层辩论、统一思想认识的基础上执行的。开始有部分干部和群众对实行生产责任制有没有好处认识不清。生产队长张振中说：“不管四定或三定实行不实行，都是一样生产，反正收多少交多少。”为了统一思想认识，社里召开了一系列的会议，进行广泛深入的宣传动员。通过查形势看任务，查三包（包工、包产、包投资）看作用，查生产管理的成绩看现存问题，组织了“实行‘四定一奖’生产责任制，对生产有利没利”、“怎样实行‘四定一奖’，生产责任制”为题的大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，大家认为，实行“四定一奖”和“三定一奖”有五大好处：一、可以更好地把公社的计划和国家的计划紧密结合起来；二、更加具体解决了统一经营、分级管理的责任范围；三、大大加强了干部和社员对完成任务的责任心；四、便于加强对生产计划和劳动、财务管理；五、可以全面搞好生产，保证活路质量。
    在统一认识、提高觉悟的基础上，全社制定了“四定一奖”制的方案。制定的方法是先由公社党委会和公社管理委员会提出“四定一奖”制的初步方案，通过社员代表大会，党员、团员、干部会，社员群众会贯彻下去，广泛吸收基层干部和社员的意见，开展全民性的大鸣大放大辩论。经过五天的鸣放辩论，共写出大字报四万一千八百张，提意见八万二千条，大大充实了“四定一奖”制的内容。最后通过社员代表大会，修改定案。定案以后，签订了合同，召开誓师大会，开展管理区与管理区、厂与厂的劳动竞赛。
      怎样实行“四定一奖”制
    红星人民公社的分级管理和“四定一奖”生产责任制，是在调整土地、牲畜、劳力、领导骨干和组织的基础上实行的。根据有利于发展生产、有利于巩固提高公社的原则，全社管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队之间，共调整土地九千多亩，调换牲口二十多头，对从事工业、农业、林业、牧业和集体福利事业的领导骨干和劳力也都进行了调整和规划。在此基础上公社根据经营范围、生产能力等条件，通过全面规划，具体制定了“四定一奖”制度。
    定生产指标　农业生产指标的确定，是根据土质的好坏、水利设备等条件，适当参考历年实际产量，采取了分区统一混合分等的办法。全社八个管理区以粮食作物为三等，再按不同作物分出等级。如第一管理区两合土地和好淤地较多，适宜种植棉花和粮食，种棉花和粮食作物均是一等区；但种花生、油料是二等区。第二管理区全部是青沙地，宜于种油料，因而油料是一等区，粮食是三等区。将全社各种农作物的生产指标，分别分配到各个单位。分配的方法是：先由公社党委和管理委员会提出各个生产单位的生产指标的初步意见，再由各个生产单位提出修改意见，最后召开社员代表大会，讨论定案。工业和副业生产指标，是本着大搞地方工业，积极发展多种经营，大搞商品生产的原则确定的。
    定投资　本着“勤俭办社，支持生产”的原则，全社生产投资的总额为五百万元，其中农业投资二百万元，工业和副业投资一百五十万元，林业投资二十万元，畜牧业投资三十万元，商业投资是十万元，其余九十万元作为机动和其他投资。
    定上交任务　各个生产单位所生产出来的一切产品，由社统一分配。为了减少手续，可以按照上述两项规定抵消后，计算出上交任务。全社的上交任务是一千三百万元，占总收入的32％。
    定增产措施　在农业生产上，社要求管理区彻底实现高级园田化，改变粗放的耕作制度，增施肥料，合理密植，彻底消灭病虫害，加强田间管理，实现农业生产机械化等。工业和副业增产的措施是：政治挂帅，书记动手，全民动员，大搞地方工业和多种经营，认真贯彻执行“小土群”的方针。林业生产措施是贯彻执行谁栽谁管，保栽保活的专人负责制。商业、畜牧业生产，也均定出了主要的增产措施，切实保证各项生产任务的完成。
    在此基础上，管理区对生产队和所辖的单位也实行了“三定一奖”（定生产指标、定投资、定增产措施、超产奖励）制。生产队对专业生产组实行五定
  （定领导、定劳力、定任务、定质量、定时间），专业组对社员实行三定（定任务、定质量、定时间）的方法。
    奖励制度　公社对积极生产、措施有力、管理好的超产单位，从超产部分中提取40％给予奖励，由超产单位作为扩大再生产和兴办福利事业的资金。60％上交给公社，公社再从超产上交部分中抽出40％作为对各个基层生产单位的奖金。对于超额完成生产任务的社员，公社也给予奖励，奖金由管理区掌握。对没有完成任务的单位或个人，给予适当的批评，不给予物质惩罚。
