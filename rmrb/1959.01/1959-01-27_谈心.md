The Yangmei Management Area of the Hekou Commune has established a good system: regular heart-to-heart meetings for commune members to resolve various internal conflicts. If used well, this system can greatly vitalize our democratic life.

Heart-to-heart meetings are a manifestation of our Party's mass line, a method consistently welcomed by the masses. This is because such meetings have a more relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, with lively and unconstrained conversations. After communization, thousands of people live in one large family, and the relationships between individuals and the collective, and between individuals, are closer than before. Naturally, there are more concerns and opinions. In this situation, it is even more beneficial to hold small, regular heart-to-heart meetings, allowing everyone to voice their opinions on the commune, the cadres, and even among commune members themselves in a timely manner. From the leadership's perspective, they can constantly hear various voices from the masses. With the support and supervision of the masses, they can be more clear-headed and more confident in their work. For the masses, the more opportunities they have to speak, the more harmonious and harmonious their relationships become, the more comfortable they feel, and the higher and stronger their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the collective cause become.

Heart-to-heart meetings should create an atmosphere where everyone feels they are talking to close friends, able to speak openly and honestly about everything. The person chairing the meeting should pay special attention to cultivating this democratic atmosphere. The main purpose of heart-to-heart meetings is to exchange opinions and experiences. Criticism of an individual's shortcomings is also possible, but criticism must be gentle, sincere, and patient, allowing the person being criticized to dare to express their differing opinions. If the person being criticized does not understand immediately, it is better to wait, rather than forcing someone to accept someone else's opinion. Of course, there may be debates during heart-to-heart talks, but if a commune member raises an opinion about the commune's work, even if the opinion is not necessarily feasible, do not immediately reject it. If a commune member criticizes a cadre, even if the facts and degree of the criticism are not entirely appropriate, an attitude of "correcting mistakes if they exist, and being encouraged if they don't" should be adopted to show welcome. When different opinions are debated, people should be convinced with reason, not intimidated with labels. In fact, this democratic atmosphere is not only needed in heart-to-heart meetings, but also in debate meetings, various work meetings, commune member congresses... It is also needed not only in meetings, but also in daily work. We must also think of various ways to enable everyone to express their opinions at any time.

Holding more heart-to-heart meetings can also supplement the shortcomings of larger-scale debate meetings. Heart-to-heart meetings involve fewer people, the topics discussed are smaller, and it is not necessary to reach a conclusion in one meeting. In this way, heart-to-heart meetings can be held more often than debate meetings, and everyone has more opportunities to speak, making it easier to speak freely. Heart-to-heart meetings can also be interspersed with debate meetings. Some problems are not clarified in debate meetings, or some people are not clear about certain problems during the debate, a small heart-to-heart meeting can be held to allow more deliberation, allowing everyone to exchange opinions more casually and gradually bring their views closer. In this way, we can not only achieve a relaxed and open atmosphere, but also improve ideological unity and understanding, so that debate meetings can be more lively and convincing.

    谈心
    易槐
    河口公社杨梅管理区规定了一项好制度，经常举行社员谈心会，调整社内的各种矛盾。运用得好，这种制度对于活跃我们的民主生活会大有作用。
    谈心会，这是我们党的群众路线的一种方式。这种方式一直很受群众欢迎。因为，这样的会议气氛比较轻松愉快，谈话生动活泼不受拘束。公社化以后，成千上万的人生活在一个大家庭里，个人和集体、个人和个人之间的关系比过去更为密切，相互之间的关心和意见自然也就更多。在这种情况下，经常举行一些小型的谈心会，使大家把对社的、对干部的以至社员彼此之间的意见，能够有机会及时的提出来，就更有好处。从领导方面来说，可以经常听到来自群众的各种声音，工作有了群众的支持和监督，心里就更清醒一些，办事也更有把握一些。对于群众来说，说话的机会越多，彼此之间的关系越融洽和谐，心情就越舒畅，对于集体事业的积极性和责任心就越高越强。
    在谈心会上要形成那么一种气氛，让大家感觉到的确是在至亲好友面前谈心，可以开诚布公无话不谈。主持会议的人要特别注意培养这种民主空气。谈心会主要是大家交换意见和经验，也可以批评某一个人的缺点，但是，批评一定要和风细雨，诚恳耐心，而且要使被批评的人敢于说出自己的不同意见。被批评的人思想一时不通，不妨有所等待，而不要勉强谁接受谁的意见。谈心中当然也可以有所争论，但是，如果是社员对公社工作提意见，即使这意见不一定能行得通，也不要马上把人碰回去；如果社员对干部有所批评，即使批评的事实、分寸还不完全恰当，也要采取有则改之无则加勉的态度表示欢迎。不同的意见进行争论时，要以理服人而不要以帽子压人。其实，这种民主空气，不仅谈心会上需要，辩论会上、各种工作会议上、社员大会上……也同样需要；不仅会议上要有民主空气，在日常工作中同样也要培养民主空气，也要想各种办法使大家能够随时提出意见。
    多开谈心会，还可以补充规模较大的辩论会的不足。谈心会的人数少一些，谈的题目也小一些，一次会上也不一定要得出结论。这样，谈心会就可以比辩论会开得更多一点，大家的发言机会也多，更容易做到畅所欲言。谈心会也可以和辩论会穿插起来进行。有些问题在辩论会上一时辩论不清楚；有些人在辩论中间一时对某些问题还弄不清楚，也可以开一个小型的谈心会多多酝酿；使大家更随便的交换意见，使看法慢慢接近起来。这样，既能做到心情舒畅无话不谈，又能提高思想统一认识，辩论会也就可以开得更生动活泼以理服人了。
