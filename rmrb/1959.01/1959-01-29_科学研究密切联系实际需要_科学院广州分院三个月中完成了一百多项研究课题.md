Scientific Research Closely Linked to Practical Needs
Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Completes Over 100 Research Projects in Three Months

    (Our report) The scientific workers of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of the Party and displaying soaring enthusiasm, have been conducting research while simultaneously establishing their institutes. In the recent short period of three months, they completed 102 scientific research projects.
    The South China Botanical Research Institute has completed a "Flora of Hainan" (manuscript), which includes all plant species on Hainan Island. The book contains approximately four million words, over a thousand illustrations, and records 250 families and over 3,600 plant species. This was compiled and written by the institute, concentrating most of its research efforts, after 50 days of arduous work. This work is of great significance for further development and utilization of plant resources on Hainan Island, as well as for the introduction and cultivation of tropical and subtropical plants in South China.
    Recently, the institute also discovered more than 100,000 mu of a wild vetiver grass in the Maoming, Dianbai, and Hua counties of Guangdong Province. After joint research and identification with the Guangzhou Baihua Perfume Factory and a paper mill, it was determined to be a very good fragrance plant. Its roots can be used to extract high-grade perfume oil and can also be used to make paper. Its stems and leaves are also good raw materials for papermaking and can be used to make high-grade writing paper. The wild vetiver grass has a rich oil content, with an oil extraction rate of 2.68%, exceeding the world's highest oil extraction rate of Java vetiver grass (2.5%). Preliminary estimates indicate that the total oil content of 100,000 mu of wild vetiver grass is 19,100 tons, which can be used to extract more than 380 tons of high-grade perfume oil, with a total value of more than 110 million yuan. This discovery not only increased the wealth of the country, but also solved the problem of insufficient seedlings for the domestic production of vetiver grass.
    The plant physiology group created a simple soil moisture meter suitable for rural use. It is small in size, easy to operate, and the degree of accuracy can reach 99.9% under careful operation, catching up with the level of the British "Rapid" soil moisture meter (99.8%). In addition, they also completed scientific works such as "Vegetation Atlas of Guangdong," "Basic Characteristics of Vegetation in Guangdong," "Natural Environment and Vegetation of Hainan Island," "Summary of Flora Survey in Western Guangdong," "Summary of Experience in Utilizing Wild Plants in Guangdong," and "Investigation and Research on Physiological Leaf Spot Disease of Sisal."
    The newly established Institute of Applied Chemistry, which is less than two months old and does not yet have a laboratory, had its fiber group use indigenous methods to conduct research on the comprehensive utilization of Masson pine needles (pine leaves), extracting several industrial raw materials from Masson pine needles: such as pine needle fiber, which is a very good raw material for papermaking; after bleaching, it can also be used to make rayon and artificial silk; pine needle oil, which is a raw material for making soap after processing; and pine needle glue, which can be used for making cardboard and wood, as well as for bonding and anti-corrosion purposes. This has found a way out for the huge output of Masson pine needles in Guangdong, which are usually treated as waste.
    The newly established Semiconductor Research Institute has trial-produced various components such as thermistors and barium-magnetic porcelain, and used indigenous methods to make a tubular high-temperature electric furnace with a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius. The young staff of the transistor technology room, who had just returned from studying at the Institute of Physics in Beijing, worked hard for a week to produce the first batch of germanium diodes, which were of good quality. After testing, they can be compared with imported goods of the same type.
    The Institute of Electronics, in cooperation with the Department of Electrical Engineering of the South China Institute of Technology and the Department of Physics of the South China Normal College, researched and designed a radio-controlled simulated automatic cockpit, and trial-produced instruments such as a dual-beam oscilloscope, an ultrasonic flaw detector, a power supply for electron microscopes, an inductance bridge, and a pulse oscilloscope.
    The Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences has completed two million words of works and investigation materials in the past three months. The ethnic group, in cooperation with the Guangdong Ethnic Investigation Group, relied on the leadership of the local Party committee and the working method of following the mass line, completed the investigation of the social history of the Li, Miao, Yao, Jing, Hui, Zhuang, and Man ethnic minorities in Guangdong ahead of schedule by two months, wrote more than 700,000 words of investigation materials, and also wrote "A Brief History and Records of the Jing Ethnic Group."
    In addition, the staff of the South China Tropical Biological Resources Comprehensive Investigation Team, who participated in the investigation of the Shiwan Mountains, traveled more than 90 li every day, climbing mountains and ridges, completed the investigation of 17 counties in more than four months, exceeding the original plan by more than four times, wrote more than 70 copies of various special reports, made 54 kinds of charts and tables, collected 23,293 specimens of various types, 331 kinds of biological resources, and found 2.64 million mu of land suitable for rubber planting.
    Most of the research units under the Guangzhou Branch are newly established and have relatively poor conditions. Some do not even have laboratories or necessary equipment. The main reasons they have been able to achieve such results are that politics has taken command, the mass line has been followed, the spirit of daring to think and act has been combined with the down-to-earth scientific spirit, and the policy of linking scientific research with practice has been correctly implemented.

    科学研究密切联系实际需要
    科学院广州分院三个月中完成了一百多项研究课题
    本报讯　中国科学院广州分院全体科学工作者，在党的领导下，发挥冲天的干劲，边建所边研究，在最近短短的三个月中，完成了一百零二项科学研究课题。
    华南植物研究所完成的一部包括海南岛所有植物种类的“海南植物志”（稿本），全书约有四百万字，图片一千多幅，记载了二百五十科三千六百多种植物。这是该所集中了大部分研究力量，经过五十天的苦战整理编写出来的。这部著作对进一步开发和利用海南岛植物资源以及引种栽培华南热带亚热带植物，有重要意义。
    这个所最近还在广东的茂名、电白、化县一带，发现有面积十万亩以上的一种野生香根草，经过该所同广州百花香料厂、造纸厂合作研究鉴定，确定是一种很优良的香料植物。它的根可以提炼高级香料油，还能造纸，它的秆和叶也是造纸的好原料，而且能造高级书写纸。野生香根草含油量很丰富，出油率达2.68％，超过世界上出油率最高的爪哇香根草（2.5％）。初步估计，十万亩野生香根草的含油总量有一万九千一百吨，可提炼高级香料油三百八十多吨，总值可达一亿一千万元以上。这一发现，不仅为国家增加了财富，而且也为国内生产香根草解决了种苗不足的问题。
    植物生理组创造出一种适于农村使用的简便土壤水分速测器，体积小，操作简单，精确程度在细致操作下可以达到千分之九百九十九，赶上英国的“快速牌”土壤水分速测器的水平（千分之九百九十八）。此外，他们还完成了“广东植被图志”、“广东植被基本特点”、“海南岛自然环境及植被”、“广东西部地区植物区系调查总结”、“广东利用野生植物经验总结”、“剑麻生理叶斑病的调查研究”等科学著作。
    刚成立不到两个月的应用化学所，实验室还没有建立，纤维组的青年就用土洋结合的办法，开展了对马尾松针（松叶）综合利用的研究，从马尾松针中提炼出好几种工业原料：如松针纤维，是一种很好的造纸原料，经过漂白处理后，还可以造人造棉和人造丝；松针油，经过加工后是制造香皂的原料；又如松针胶，可作制纸板、木板，作粘合与防腐用。这为广东产量巨大的、被人们当作废物的马尾松针找到了出路。
    新建立的半导体研究所，试制出热敏电阻、钡——磁性瓷等多种元件，用土洋结合的办法制成温度达到一千五百度的管式高温电炉。刚从北京的物理研究所学习回去的晶体管工艺室的青年工作人员，他们苦战一周，制出了第一批锗二极管，质量良好。经过测验，可以和同类型的进口货媲美。
    电子学研究所同华南工学院电工系和华南师范学院物理系合作，研究设计成无线电操纵模拟自动驾驶舱，并试制出双射线示波器、超声探伤器、电子显微镜用电源、电感桥、脉冲示波器等仪器。
    哲学社会科学研究所三个多月来完成了二百万字的著作和调查资料。民族组同广东民族调查组合作，依靠当地党委的领导和走群众路线的工作方法，提前两个月完成了对广东地区黎、苗、瑶、京、回、僮、满等少数民族社会历史的调查，写出了调查资料七十多万字，还写出了“京族简史简志”。
    此外，参加十万大山考察的华南热带生物资源综合考察队的工作人员，在四个多月来，每天走九十多里路，翻山越岭，完成了十七个县的考察工作，超过原订计划的四倍多，写出各种专题报告资料七十多份，制成各类图表五十四份，采集各类标本二万三千二百九十三号，生物资源三百三十一种，并且找出了橡胶宜林地二百六十四万亩。
    广州分院所属的研究单位大部分是新成立的，条件都比较差，有的连实验室和必要的设备都没有，他们能够取得这样的成绩，主要是政治挂了帅，走群众路线，把敢想敢做的风格和脚踏实地的科学精神结合起来，正确地贯彻了科学研究联系实际的方针的结果。
