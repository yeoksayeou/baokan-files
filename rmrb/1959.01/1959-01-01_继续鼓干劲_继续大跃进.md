Continue to Exert Efforts, Continue the Great Leap Forward
Li Qi

1958 was the first year of the implementation of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and it was also the first year that the Chinese people realized an all-round Great Leap Forward with giant strides. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, after a year of arduous struggle, the people of the whole country have achieved extremely brilliant accomplishments on all fronts of the national economy. Major industrial and agricultural products such as steel, electricity, grain, and cotton have all increased by one time or more compared with 1957, creating unprecedented miracles in the history of industrial and agricultural development. These facts fully demonstrate the correctness of the Party's General Line for building socialism and the superiority of the socialist system.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, I believe there are five major events worth mentioning in particular: the creation of a complete set of experiences in large-area, high-yield, and abundant harvests in agriculture; the comprehensive leap forward in the industrial front, taking steel as the key link; the establishment and development of the people's communes; the integration of education with productive labor; and the participation of cadres in labor. The achievements in these five aspects have paved the way for our country to completely solve the food problem, accelerate industrialization, and gradually reduce the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 not only brought us great harvests in material production, but also brought us great harvests in the theory, policies, and experience of building socialism. In a sense, the latter is even more important for our country's future development. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is a conclusion on the main experiences of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, correctly implementing the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is the most important guarantee for our country to strive for greater victories in 1959.

1959 will be a year of even greater leap forward. Steel production is to be increased to 18 million tons, and grain production will be increased to 1,050 billion catties. We not only have the confidence to complete this, but also the confidence to exceed it. The key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership and implementing the principle of putting politics in command. Only in this way can we fully grasp the laws of development of objective things and fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.

Secondly, we must not only implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward, but also pay attention to proportionate development. This is an important experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Otherwise, it will hinder the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural production.

Thirdly, in all work, we must see both people and things. It is certainly wrong to see only things and not people, but conversely, it is also wrong to only see the subjective initiative of people without considering any objective conditions. Chairman Mao said in his book "On Protracted War": "Those who direct a war cannot overstep the limits imposed by objective conditions and expect to win; however, they can and must strive for victory within the limits allowed by objective conditions." Chairman Mao's instruction is still fully applicable to our construction work today. In the past, we criticized "the theory of everything depends on conditions" because this viewpoint only sees things and not people, thereby causing people to bow their heads in the face of difficulties and preventing them from leaping forward; but this does not mean that we can ignore objective conditions when doing work. Marxists are unitarians of people and things who see both people and things. The two cannot be completely separated.

1959 has arrived. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we have full confidence in striving for even greater victories.

    继续鼓干劲　继续大跃进
    李琪
    1958年，是党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线开始实行的第一年，也是我国人民以巨大的步伐实现全面大跃进的第一年。全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过一年的苦战，在国民经济的各个战线上获得了极为光辉的成就，钢铁、电力、粮食、棉花等主要工农业产品，都比1957年增加一倍或一倍以上，创造了工农业发展史上空前未有的奇迹。这些事实，充分说明了党的建设社会主义总路线的正确性，说明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    在1958年的大跃进中，值得大书而特书的，我认为有以下五件大事：在农业上创造出了一整套大面积高额丰产的经验；工业战线上的以钢为纲，全面跃进；人民公社的建立和发展；教育与生产劳动相结合；干部参加劳动。这五方面的成就，为我国彻底解决粮食问题，加速工业化、逐步缩小城乡差别，工农差别，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别等等开辟了道路。1958年的大跃进，不仅在物质生产上我们获得了伟大的丰收，而且在建设社会主义的理论方面，政策方面，经验方面，也获得了伟大的丰收。后者在一定意义上说，对我国今后的发展更为重要，党的八届六中全会的决议，就是对大跃进的主要经验所做的结论。因此，正确贯彻执行党的八届六中全会的决议，是我国在1959年争取更大胜利的最重要的保证。
    1959年，是更大跃进的一年。钢产量要增加到一千八百万吨，粮食产量将增加到一万零五百亿斤，我们不但有信心完成，还有信心超过，关键就在于加强党的领导，贯彻政治挂帅。只有这样才能既充分掌握客观事物发展的规律，又充分发动群众的革命干劲。
    其次，既要贯彻以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。又要注意按比例发展，这是1958年大跃进的一个重要的经验。否则就会障碍高速度地发展工农业生产。
    再次，在各项工作中，既要见人，又要见物。只见物不见人固然不对，但反过来只看到人的主观能动性，不考虑任何客观条件，也是不对的。毛主席在“论持久战”一书中说：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利”。毛主席的这一指示，对于我们今天的建设工作，也还是完全适用的。过去我们批评“唯条件论”，是因为这种观点只见物不见人，从而使人们在困难面前低头，不能跃进；但这决不是说做工作就可以不考虑客观条件了。马克思主义者是见人又见物的人和物的统一论者。不能把两者截然分开。
    1959年来了。回顾过去，瞻望将来，我们有充分的信心，争取更大的胜利。
