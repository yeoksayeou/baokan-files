Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow, January 3rd (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union extend congratulations to the scientists, engineers, technicians, workers, and all personnel who participated in the creation and launch of the multi-stage space rocket.

The congratulatory message states that the creation of the multi-stage space rocket and its successful launch towards the moon on January 2, 1959, marks a tremendous achievement for Soviet science and technology.

The congratulatory message emphasized that the first interplanetary flight of the Soviet space rocket opened a glorious page in the research of outer space, and demonstrated to all mankind the creative genius of the free Soviet people and the great scientific and technological progress achieved by the working people of the world's first socialist country.

The congratulatory telegram expresses confidence that the Soviet scientists, engineers, and all personnel who participated in the creation and launch of the space rocket will continue to bring joy to the Soviet Union and all progressive humanity with new discoveries and achievements of world significance.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow time 7:25 (Beijing time 12:25) TASS dispatch: TASS communique:

At 5:59 Moscow time on January 4th (10:59 Beijing time), the Soviet space rocket passed the closest point to the moon on its trajectory. The rocket's instruments and transmitters continue to function normally, sending back valuable scientific intelligence to ground receiving stations. The scientific tasks predetermined before the launch of the space rocket have been fully accomplished.

As the rocket moves further and further away from the Earth, and as the power source is depleted, radio contact with the space rocket will become increasingly poor, and it appears that it will cease within the next 24 hours.

Now, the space rocket is slowly moving across the sky, still located in the constellation Virgo. At 7:01 Moscow time, the rocket's declination was minus 10.8 degrees, and the right ascension was 14 hours 14 minutes.

At 9:00 AM Moscow time (2:00 PM Beijing time), the space rocket will be located over Angola, South Africa (20 degrees East longitude and 11 degrees 25 minutes South latitude), at a distance of 390,000 kilometers from the Earth.

As the space rocket moves further and further away from the Earth and the Moon, the influence of the Earth and the Moon on the rocket's movement will gradually weaken. The rocket's movement will be determined to an increasing extent only by the Sun's gravity. The rocket will enter its own final elliptical orbit around the Sun, thereby becoming the first artificial planet in the solar system. This will effectively begin to occur from January 7-8.

The experimental observation results obtained by the Soviet space rocket will be compiled and published.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow time 17:00 (Beijing time 22:00) TASS dispatch: At 12:00 Moscow time on the 4th (17:00 Beijing time), the Soviet space rocket was 422,000 kilometers from the center of the Earth and 60,000 kilometers from the center of the Moon.

The space rocket continues to rush away from the Earth and the Moon and is gradually entering an elliptical orbit around the Sun.

At 12:00 Moscow time (17:00 Beijing time), the rocket's position was, right ascension 14 hours 15 minutes, declination minus 12 degrees.

Soviet ground observation stations are continuing to listen to the signals sent by the rocket.

According to measurements, the temperature of the rocket's surface is between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, and the temperature of the internal devices and gases in the container holding the scientific instruments is between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, thus ensuring that the instruments function normally.

On January 4, when the Soviet space rocket passed very close to the moon, observation stations throughout the Soviet Union continued to observe the parameters of the rocket's trajectory.

As a result of measuring the radial velocity of the rocket as it passed near the Moon, the maximum value of the radial velocity in this region was recorded as 2.45 kilometers per second at 5:57 Moscow time on January 4. This is consistent with other measurements of its trajectory when the rocket was closest to the Moon.

In this way, the space rocket has traveled 370,000 kilometers from the Earth to the Moon in less than one and a half days (34 hours).

The results of the orbital measurements provide rich data for determining the orbital elements of the rocket as it approaches the Moon, and provide rich data for determining scientific observation materials in space. These results are now being processed using electronic computers.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow time 3rd 23:45 (Beijing time 4th 4:45) dispatch: TASS communique on the launch of the space rocket towards the Moon.

As a result of measuring the orbit of the Soviet space rocket using radio technology equipment, accurate data on the parameters of the rocket's movement were obtained. This makes it possible to reliably calculate the data of the predetermined target and to make long-term predictions about the rocket's movement. Through these data, the elements of the orbit of the space rocket as an artificial planet of the solar system have also been determined.

According to preliminary calculations, after entering the orbit of an artificial satellite of the Sun (i.e., an artificial planet), the space rocket will move along an orbit close to a circle. The maximum diameter of the artificial planet's orbit is 343.6 million kilometers, and the orbital period is approximately 15 months. The eccentricity of the elliptical orbit will be 0.148, and the long axis of the orbit of the artificial planet will form an angle of 15 degrees with the long axis of the Earth's orbit. The orbital plane of the artificial planet is almost consistent with the orbital plane of the Earth.

The Soviet artificial planet, moving along its orbit, will reach its closest point to the Sun (perihelion) on January 14, 1959, at which time it will be approximately 146.44 million kilometers away from the Sun. The artificial planet will reach its furthest point from the Sun (aphelion) in early September 1959 - 197.2 million kilometers.

The adjustment calculation center is continuing to process the large amount of orbital measurement data and to further determine the movement parameters of the space rocket.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow time 3rd 19:45 (Beijing time 4th 0:45) dispatch: At 16:00 Moscow time on the 3rd (21:00 Beijing time), the Soviet space rocket was located above Peru (8 degrees 20 minutes South latitude and 86 degrees West longitude). At this point, its distance from the Earth was 237,000 kilometers, and its distance from the Moon was 131,000 kilometers.

The Soviet scientific stations observing the rocket and receiving scientific intelligence stopped radio contact with the rocket at 13:00 Moscow time on the 3rd, because it fell below the horizon as a result of the Earth's rotation.

The rocket will continue to move westward over the Pacific Ocean, and North and South American countries can clearly observe it. According to calculations, the rocket will pass over the following locations on Earth at 19:00, 21:00, and 24:00 Moscow time on January 3: 8 degrees 57 minutes South latitude, 9 degrees 18 minutes South latitude, 9 degrees 45 minutes South latitude, 131 degrees and 160 degrees West longitude, and 155 degrees East longitude. The distances between the rocket and the Earth are 265,000 kilometers, 284,000 kilometers, and 311,000 kilometers, respectively.

At 1:00 Moscow time on January 4, Soviet observation stations will again be able to observe the rocket and begin receiving scientific intelligence, because the rocket will rise again from the eastern horizon at this time.

All the scientific instruments and radio transmitters in the rocket continue to function normally. Materials on the rocket's trajectory will continue to be published on January 4.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, according to TASS Moscow time 3rd 22:30 (Beijing time 4th 3:30) dispatch: Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Topchiev, told TASS reporters that, according to Soviet observation station materials, as of 21:00 Moscow time on the 3rd (2:00 AM Beijing time on the 4th), the Soviet lunar rocket had reached a height of 284,000 kilometers, with a speed of approximately 9,000 kilometers per hour. Thus, it has almost completed 80% of the journey from Earth to the Moon.

Topchiev also said that it has now been finally confirmed that the Soviet lunar rocket will become a satellite of the Sun, that is, the first artificial planet. Based on the flight speed and direction, it can be said with complete certainty that the bonds of Earth's gravity have been broken, and this spacecraft will never return to Earth.

Xinhua News Agency, January 4th, Moscow time 4th 7:20 (Beijing time 12:20) dispatch: From 20:36 on January 3, scientific observation stations in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union once again received radio signals from the Soviet space rocket, with frequencies of 19.993 MHz, 19.995 MHz, and 19.997 MHz. The reception started much earlier than the time the rocket began to emerge from the horizon. From 0:30 Moscow time on January 4 (5:30 Beijing time), radio signals with a frequency of 183.6 MHz were received again. The scientific instruments and radio transmitters on the rocket continue to function normally. The information received proves that the rocket continues to fly along its predetermined trajectory towards the Moon.

At 3:00 Moscow time on January 4 (8:00 Beijing time), the rocket's position was over the Indian Ocean, south of Java Island (110 degrees East longitude and 10 degrees 7 minutes South latitude), 336,000 kilometers from the Earth. The rocket is approaching the Moon. At 5:59 Moscow time (10:59 Beijing time), the rocket will pass very close to the Moon, at which time the distance from the lunar surface will be 7,500 kilometers, and the distance from the center of the Earth will be 370,000 kilometers. Then the rocket will move further and further away from the Moon, gradually entering its own solar system planetary orbit. The scientific information from the space rocket is now continuing to be transmitted according to the predetermined measurement program. (Attached picture)

(From this diagram, you can see the comparison between the trajectory of an artificial planet and a natural planet. The direction in which planets orbit the sun is the same. Because the moon's distance from the earth is only about one three hundred and ninetieth of the earth's distance from the sun, the moon is not drawn on this proportional diagram.)

    探测月宫的任务胜利完成  第一个人造行星遨游太空
    苏联火箭飞过月球将绕太阳运行
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议向制造和发射宇宙火箭的人员祝贺
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议向参加制造和发射多级宇宙火箭的科学家、工程师、技术员、工人和全体工作人员表示祝贺。
    贺词说，多级宇宙火箭的造成和它在1959年1月2日朝月球方向的成功发射，标志着苏联科学和技术取得了极伟大的成就。
    贺词着重说，苏联宇宙火箭的第一次行星际飞行在宇宙空间的研究方面揭开了光荣的一页，并向全人类显示了自由的苏维埃人民的创造天才和世界上第一个社会主义国家的劳动人民所取得的巨大的科学技术进步。
    贺电确信，参加制造和发射宇宙火箭的苏联科学家、工程师以及全体工作人员，还将会更多地以具有世界意义的新发现和新成就给苏联和全体进步人类带来喜悦。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社4日莫斯科时间七时二十五分（北京时间十二时二十五分）电：塔斯社公报：
    1月4日莫斯科时间五时五十九分（北京时间十时五十九分）苏联宇宙火箭通过了其轨道上离月球最近的一点。火箭的仪器和发射机继续正常工作，并向地面接收站发回珍贵的科学情报。在发射宇宙火箭以前预定的科学任务，已经全部完成。
    由于火箭离地球越来越远，以及电源的耗竭，同宇宙火箭的无线电联系将越来越差，看来将在今后一昼夜内停止。
    现在，宇宙火箭正沿着天穹缓缓运行，仍然处在室女星座中。在莫斯科时间七时一分，火箭的赤纬为负一○点八度，而赤经是十四时十四分。
    在莫斯科时间上午九时（北京时间十四时），宇宙火箭将处于南非安哥拉（东经二十度和南纬十一度二十五分）上空，距离地球三十九万公里。
    随着宇宙火箭离开地球和月球越来越远，地球和月球对火箭运行的影响将逐渐减弱。火箭的运行将在越来越大的程度上只决定于太阳引力。火箭将进入它自己的围绕太阳的最终椭圆轨道，从而成为第一个太阳系人造行星。这件事将实际上从1月7—8日开始发生。
    通过苏联宇宙火箭获得的试验观测结果，将边整理边公布。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社4日莫斯科时间十七时（北京时间二十二时）讯：4日莫斯科时间十二时正苏联宇宙火箭已距离地球中心四十二万二千公里，距离月球中心六万公里。
    宇宙火箭正在继续远离地球和月球而向前飞奔，并正逐步进入围绕太阳的椭圆形轨道。
    当莫斯科时间十二时（北京时间十七时）的时候，火箭的位置是，赤经十四时十五分，赤纬负十二度。
    苏联地面的观察站都在继续收听火箭发来的讯号。
    据测定，火箭表面的温度为摄氏十度至十五度，装有科学仪器的容器的内部装置和气体的温度在摄氏十度至十五度之间，从而能保证仪器正常进行工作。
    在1月4日，当苏联宇宙火箭在离月球很近的地方通过的时候，苏联各地观察站继续观测了火箭运行的参数。
    由于对火箭飞过月球附近时的径向速度进行了测量，在1月4日五时五十七分（莫斯科时间）记录下了在这一地区径向速度的最大数值为每秒二点四五公里。这同在火箭离月球最近时对其轨道的其他测量的资料是符合的。
    这样，宇宙火箭就在不到一个半昼夜（三十四小时）的时间内已从地球向月球飞行了三十七万公里。
    轨道测量的结果，为确定火箭在靠近月球时的轨道要素，提供了丰富的资料，并且为在空间测定科学观察材料，提供了丰富的资料。现在这些结果正在用电子计算机进行整理。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科时间3日二十三时四十五分（北京时间四时四十五分）消息：塔斯社关于向月球方向发射宇宙火箭的公报。
    由于用无线电技术设备对苏联宇宙火箭的轨道进行了测量，得到了关于这个火箭运动参数的精确数据。这样就可能可靠地算出预定目标的数据，并且对火箭的运动提出长期的预报。通过这些数据，还确定了作为太阳系人造行星的宇宙火箭的轨道的要素。
    根据初步计算的数据，宇宙火箭在进入太阳的人造卫星（即人造行星）的轨道以后，将要沿着接近圆形的轨道运动。人造行星轨道的最大直径为三亿四千三百六十万公里，运行周期约为十五个月。椭圆轨道的偏心率将为○·一四八，人造行星轨道的长轴将同地球轨道的长轴成十五度角。人造行星的轨道平面同地球轨道平面几乎是一致的。
    苏联人造行星沿着轨道运动，将于1959年1月14日达到最接近太阳之点（近日点），到那时它将离开太阳大约一亿四千六百四十万公里。人造行星将于1959年9月初达到离太阳最远的地方（远日点）——一亿九千七百二十万公里。
    调整计算中心正在继续整理大量的轨道测量资料，并且进一步确定宇宙火箭的运动参数。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科时间3日十九时四十五分（北京时间4日零时四十五分）消息：3日莫斯科时间十六时（北京时间二十一时），苏联宇宙火箭处在秘鲁上空（南纬八度二十分和西经八十六度）。这时它同地球的距离为二十三万七千公里，离月球还有十三万一千公里。
    苏联对火箭进行观测和接收科学情报的各科学站，在3日莫斯科时间十三时停止了同火箭的无线电联系，因为它由于地球运行结果落到地平线下去了。
    火箭将继续在太平洋上空向西运动，北美和南美各国可以清楚地观测到。据计算，火箭在1月3日莫斯科时间十九时、二十一时、二十四时将分别通过地球下述地点上空：南纬八度五十七分，九度十八分，九度四十五分，西经一百三十一度和一百六十度，东经一百五十五度。火箭同地球距离分别为二十六万五千公里，二十八万四千公里和三十一万一千公里。
    1月4日莫斯科时间一时，苏联各观测站将重新有可能观测火箭和开始接收科学情报，因为火箭这时又将从东方地平线升起。
    火箭全部科学仪器及其无线电发射机继续正常工作。1月4日将继续发表火箭运行材料。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科时间3日二十二时三十分（北京时间4日三时三十分）消息：苏联科学院副院长托普切夫对塔斯社记者说，据苏联观测站材料，到莫斯科时间3日二十一时（北京时间4日清晨二时），苏联月球火箭达二十八万四千公里高度，运行速度约为每小时九千公里。这样，它几乎走完了地球到月球路程的80％。
    托普切夫还说，现在已经最后肯定，苏联月球火箭将成为太阳卫星，即第一个人造行星。根据飞行速度和方向可以完全有把握地说，地球引力羁绊已被摆脱，这个宇宙飞船永远不回地球了。
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社4日莫斯科时间七时二十分（北京时间十二时二十分）电：从1月3日二十时三十六分起，苏联东部地区的科学观测站重新收到苏联宇宙火箭的无线电讯号，其频率分别为一九点九九三兆周、一九点九九五兆周和一九点九九七兆周。开始收到时间比火箭开始飞出地平线的时间早得多。从1月4日莫斯科时间零时三十分（北京时间五时三十分就重新收到频率为一八三点六兆周的无线电讯号。火箭上的科学仪器和无线电发射机继续正常工作。收到的情报证明，火箭继续沿着向月球方向的预定轨道飞行。
    莫斯科时间1月4日三时（北京时间八时）火箭的位置在印度洋爪哇岛以南（东经一百一十度和南纬十度七分）的上空，离地球三十三万六千公里。火箭正在接近月球。莫斯科时间五时五十九分（北京时间十时五十九分），火箭将在离月球极近的地方通过，这时离开月球表面的距离将为七千五百公里，而离地球中心的距离将为三十七万公里。然后火箭将离月球越来越远，逐渐进入它自己的太阳系行星轨道。现在宇宙火箭上的科学情报正在按照预定的测量程序继续传来。（附图片）
