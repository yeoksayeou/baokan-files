    Difficult and Not Difficult
    Li Shu
    People's communes have established many collective welfare undertakings, bringing smiles to the faces of men, women, old, and young. However, the development is still uneven. Many communes are doing well in this regard, while others lag behind. There are many reasons for the lagging, but one subjective reason is that some managers initially believe that collective welfare undertakings are difficult to manage, saying, "It is difficult to please everyone."
    In fact, this matter is both difficult and not difficult.
    It is said to be difficult because it is indeed not easy to make everyone satisfied with collective welfare undertakings. Collective living is not about uniformity or the simplest average. People have common needs, but they also have many different needs. Take eating, for example. Everyone has different preferences and tastes. Many people eating in public canteens perfectly illustrate the saying, "It is difficult to cater to all tastes." While cooking large pots of food may seem easy, there is a lot of skill involved in ensuring that everyone is full, eats well, and eats clean, hygienic food.
    However, difficulty is only one aspect of the matter. From another perspective, it can be said that it is not difficult at all.
    Why can it be "not difficult"? Here, we can take the Beizhuang canteen in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, as an example. The Beizhuang canteen is well-run and deeply welcomed by commune members. The cook, Yan Junfang, can make two hundred and twenty-eight different dishes. It is indeed not easy for a "local" cook to make so many dishes, but she was not able to do so from the beginning. It was only when the commune members were dissatisfied with the limited variety of dishes and complained that she was touched. She thought: The commune members work so hard. It doesn't feel right to only give them radishes and greens. Putting herself in their shoes, she wouldn't feel comfortable either. Therefore, she started to use her brain and increase the variety of dishes. This "putting herself in their shoes" is truly commendable. It shows that the staff are not being subjective in their work, not replacing the wishes of the masses with their own preferences, but truly recognizing the importance of running the canteen well and being good at thinking from the masses' perspective. They also set up a life suggestion box to give commune members ample opportunity to express their opinions. When everyone takes care of their own affairs and cares for each other, what difficulties cannot be solved? Naturally, not all the requests made by the commune members can be met, but after explanation, everyone can always feel comfortable and satisfied. This approach perfectly compensates for the shortcomings of "putting oneself in their shoes." Because what a few managers can see and think of is ultimately limited and cannot be perfect. It is necessary to solicit opinions widely, draw on collective wisdom, and make things even more perfect.
    Running a public canteen is like this, and running other welfare undertakings is also like this. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, have everyone come up with ideas, and have everyone think of solutions, we can come up with many practical solutions, and any difficulties can be easily solved. Even if some problems cannot be solved temporarily, everyone can see them clearly and work together to create conditions for their solution. The reason why it is not difficult lies here.
    When vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings, management staff should see both the difficult and the not difficult aspects. Seeing the difficulty allows them to take into account the different needs of the people, so as not to force uniformity and simplify things. Seeing that it is not difficult allows them to be full of confidence, fearless, and to embark on the correct path – caring for the masses, promoting democracy, and entrusting the affairs of the people to the people.

    也难也不难
    黎曙
    人民公社里举办了许多集体福利事业，使得男女老少笑逐颜开。这方面，现在也还不平衡，有许多公社搞得好，有些地方就差些。差些，当然有许多原因，其中有一个主观上的原因，就是有些管理人员首先认为集体福利事业难搞，“一人难称百人心”嘛。
    其实，这事也难也不难。
    说它难，是因为集体福利事业要办到大家满意，确实不容易。生活集体化并不是清一色，并不是最简单的平均数。人们的需要有相同之处，但也有很多不同之处。就拿吃饭来说吧，各人的喜好口味不同，许多人在公共食堂里吃饭，正应了“众口难调”的一句老话。大锅饭看来虽然好做，但要做到人人吃饱、吃好、吃得干净卫生，这其中就大有学问了。
    不过，难，只是事情的一个方面；从另一方面来看，也可以说并不难。
    为什么能够“不难”呢？这里不妨以江苏武进县的贝庄食堂为例。贝庄食堂是一个办得很好、深受社员欢迎的食堂。厨师严俊芳可以做出二百二十八种不同的菜来。一个“土”厨师能做这样多的菜，确实不简单，不过她也并不是一开始就能做得这样多的，只是当社员吃着少样的菜不满意，论长论短时，才触动了她的思想。她想：社员干活那样辛苦，光是给他们吃萝卜青菜，将心比心，换了自己也感到不舒服。因此才开动脑筋，把菜的花样做多起来。难能可贵的是这“将心比心”。这表明工作人员不是主观主义地在办事，不是以一己所好来代替群众的愿望，而是真正认识到办好食堂的重要意义，善于设身处地地为群众着想。他们还设立了生活意见栏，让社员有充分发表意见的机会。大家的事大家管，大家关心，还有什么困难不能解决的呢？自然，并不是所有的社员提出的要求都能做到，不过经过解释，大家总能心情舒畅，没有什么不满意了。这种做法，正好弥补了“将心比心”的不足。因为少数管理人员能够看得到的，想得到的，到底有限，不可能尽善尽美，必须广发言路，集思广益，才能使事情做得更臻完美。
    办公共食堂是如此，办其他的福利事业也是如此。只要充分发动群众，依靠群众，人人出主意，个个想办法，便能想出许许多多切实可行的办法，不论什么样的困难，都能迎刃而解了。即使暂时还不能解决的，大家也都看得清清楚楚，为它的解决共同来创造条件。不难的道理，就在这里。
    大搞集体福利事业，管理工作人员都应该看到这难和不难两方面。看到难，才能照顾到人们的不同的需要，不致于强求统一，简单行事；看到不难，才能信心十足，无所畏惧，也才会走上正确的途径——关心群众，发扬民主，大家的事情，交给大家来办。
