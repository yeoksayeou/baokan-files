    Reactionary Policies Meet Resistance Everywhere, Ruling Position Difficult to Stabilize
    Kishinobu at the End of His Rope
    Desperately Attempts to Escape Predicament by Slandering China and the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency Commentary

    Japanese Prime Minister Kishinobu willingly acts as a lackey of U.S. imperialism, goes against the will of the Japanese people, implements a latent imperialist policy externally, and carries out fascist rule internally, threatening the peace and security of the Japanese nation and Asian countries. These reactionary domestic and foreign policies of his have met with strong resistance from the Japanese people and powerful criticism from the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party, putting him in a crisis. Kishinobu is also forced to admit that his ruling position is unstable, but he reverses black and white and attributes the instability of the Japanese political situation to "disruptive activities from foreign countries."

    Kishinobu said at a press conference on the 21st that the "unstable situation in the Japanese political situation has not been eliminated, and various ideas and anxieties remain within the party. Therefore, internationally, the free camp is watching us with unease, and we are subjected to disruptive activities by the communist camp; and domestically, just as the House of Councillors election is about to be held and the Diet is about to reconvene, the situation will become very difficult to deal with." When reporters asked him what he meant by "disruptive activities from foreign countries," Kishinobu shamelessly said: China and the Soviet Union "issued protest statements regarding the negotiations on the revision of the (Japan-U.S.) 'Security Treaty.' This is clearly interference in internal affairs."

    The crystal-clear fact is that Kishinobu attempts to forcibly revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" to implement a police terror rule domestically and revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to drag Japan onto the road of devastating war. These conspiracies of the Kishinobu government have aroused the raging anger of the Japanese people, further sharpening the contradictions between the Japanese and U.S. nations and the class contradictions within Japan. This is precisely the root cause of the crisis in the Kishinobu government.

    In order to cover up the true cause of the instability of the Japanese political situation, Kishinobu is once again playing his "specialty," that is, reversing black and white, saying that the instability of the Japanese political situation is due to "disruptive activities from foreign countries," "China and the Soviet Union issued protest statements regarding the negotiations on the revision of the (Japan-U.S.) 'Security Treaty,' which is clearly interference in internal affairs," etc., to deceive the Japanese people, attempt to divert attention, and vainly attempt to use nationalist sentiment to stir up anti-China and anti-Soviet public opinion in order to extricate himself from his predicament.

    Kishinobu should understand that it was not the governments of China and the Soviet Union that asked him to submit the "Police Duties Execution Law" amendment to the Japanese Diet's extraordinary session to provoke the Japanese people's just struggle against the Kishinobu government; Kishinobu understands in his heart that the Japanese people oppose the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan, the control of Japan in politics, economy, diplomacy, and other aspects, and urgently demand to drive away the U.S. troops and gain true independence and autonomy. Everyone knows that Japanese progressive parties, mass organizations, and peace-loving Japanese people have long demanded that Japan take the road of neutrality and that Japan coexist peacefully with all countries. And the governments of China and the Soviet Union have successively issued statements hoping that Japan will take the road of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, only to support the above-mentioned just demands of the Japanese people and to maintain peace in Asia and the world. This hope of the governments of China and the Soviet Union not only conforms to the interests of the Japanese nation, but also conforms to the interests of the Asian people. Therefore, these two statements have received enthusiastic support from the Japanese people. Of course, these two statements greatly shocked the Kishinobu government, which feared that these two statements would affect its negotiations with the United States on revising the "Security Treaty" and hinder its pursuit of an aggressive policy following the United States. Therefore, Kishinobu became angry and attacked the governments of China and the Soviet Union for issuing this statement as "interference in internal affairs," but no matter how much he attacks or fabricates rumors and slanders, he cannot relieve the worries in Kishinobu's heart and cannot help him get rid of the increasingly difficult situation.

    Another reason for the increasing chaos in the Japanese political situation is the factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party. The Kishinobu group once attempted to ease the increasingly sharp contradictions within the party by wooing the "anti-mainstream faction" Kojiro Ishii into the cabinet and partially reorganizing the cabinet and party leadership, but Kishinobu's plan fell through, and these measures did not stabilize Kishinobu's position. Currently, there is another fierce struggle surrounding the re-election of the president. With the "anti-mainstream faction" nominating Kenzo Matsumura as a candidate for president to confront Kishinobu, the "mainstream faction's" attempt to have Kishinobu re-elected by advancing the presidential re-election to January 24 will also encounter difficulties. Is the difficulty from within the Liberal Democratic Party also a "disruptive activity from foreign countries"?

    It should be pointed out that the Japanese economic crisis is an important factor that makes the Kishinobu group feel more and more unstable. Can Kishinobu find an excuse related to "disruptive activities from foreign countries" from the economic crisis caused by the laws of capitalist economy?

    It seems that Kishinobu is really worried about the fact that "the free camp is watching us with unease." According to an Associated Press report on December 29 last year, "The United States is closely watching the political threat faced by Prime Minister Kishinobu after the resignation of three members of his cabinet." U.S. officials admitted that "relations between the United States and Japan have been very good during Kishinobu's administration. But no one thinks he is the only Japanese leader who can maintain this relationship." Kishinobu is obviously worried about falling out of favor with his U.S. masters.

    According to a recent report in the "Japan Economic News," Japanese monopoly capital groups are disappointed with Kishinobu, sternly reprimanding Kishinobu, and even some in the monopoly capital groups have begun to consider the issue of forming a third party.

    Kishinobu's claim that the unease in the Japanese political situation is due to "disruptive activities from foreign countries" can only show that he is already "at the end of his rope" in the face of an increasingly deepening crisis.

### 反动政策四处碰壁统治地位难于稳定  岸信介黔驴技穷  妄想用诬蔑中苏两国的可耻手法来摆脱窘境

    反动政策四处碰壁统治地位难于稳定
    岸信介黔驴技穷
    妄想用诬蔑中苏两国的可耻手法来摆脱窘境
    新华社记者述评
    日本首相岸信介甘心充当美帝国主义的奴仆，违背日本人民意志，对外执行潜在的帝国主义政策，对内实行法西斯统治，威胁日本民族和亚洲各国的和平和安全。他执行的这些反动的内外政策，遭到日本人民坚强的反击和自由民主党内部“反主流派”的有力抨击，使他面临危机。岸信介也不得不承认他的统治地位不稳，但是他却颠倒黑白地把日本政局的不稳归因于“来自外国的扰乱活动”。
    岸信介21日在记者招待会上说，日本“政局的不稳定情况还没有消除，党内还留下了各种各样的想法和不安情绪。因此，在国际上，自由阵营以不安的神色注视着我们，我们还遭到共产主义阵营的扰乱活动；而在国内，正当就要举行参议院选举和国会就要复会的时候，情况将变得非常难于应付”。当记者问他所谓“来自外国的扰乱活动”是指什么时，岸信介竟无耻地说：中国和苏联“对于（日美）改订‘安全条约’的谈判，发表了抗议声明。这明明是干涉内政”。
    明如观火的事实是：岸信介企图强行修改“警察官职务执行法”，对内实行警察的恐怖统治并且修改日美“安全条约”把日本拖上毁灭性战争的道路。岸介信政府的这些阴谋激起了日本人民的熊熊怒火；使日美民族矛盾和日本国内阶级矛盾进一步尖锐化了。这正是使岸信介政府陷入危机的根本原因。
    岸信介为了掩盖日本政局不稳的真实原因，这次又玩弄他的“拿手好戏”，即颠倒黑白地说什么日本政局不稳是“来自外国的扰乱活动”，“中国和苏联对于（日美）改订‘安全条约’的谈判发表了抗议声明，这明明是干涉内政”等等，来欺骗日本人民，企图转移视线，并且妄想利用民族主义情绪，煽动起反对中苏的舆论，以解脱自己的狼狈处境。
    岸信介理应明白不是中苏两国政府要它向日本国会临时会议提出“警职法”修正案来激起日本人民反对岸信介政府的正义斗争；岸信介心里明白日本人民反对美国军队驻扎日本，在政治、经济、外交等各方面控制日本，迫切要求赶走美国军队，获得真正的独立自主。谁都知道日本进步党派，群众团体和爱好和平的日本人民早就要求日本走中立的道路要求日本同各国和平共处。而中苏两国政府先后发表声明，希望日本走和平、独立、民主和中立的道路，只是支持日本人民的上述正义要求和维护亚洲和世界和平。中苏两国政府的这种希望不仅符合日本民族的利益，也符合亚洲人民的利益。因此这两项声明受到了日本人民的热烈支持。当然这两项声明使岸信介政府大为震惊，它害怕这两项声明影响到它同美国进行的修改“安全条约”的谈判，妨碍它追随美国推行侵略政策。因此岸信介恼羞成怒，攻击中苏两国政府发表这项声明是“干涉内政”，但是不管攻击也罢，造谣诬蔑也罢，都不能解除岸信介心中的烦恼，不能帮助他摆脱日益困难的处境。
    使日本政局越来越混乱的另一个原因是自由民主党内的派系斗争。岸信介集团曾经企图通过拉拢“反主流派”的石井光次郎入阁和局部改组内阁和党内领导机构来缓和党内日益尖锐的矛盾，但是岸信介的打算落了空，这些措施都没有使岸信介的地位稳定下来。目前，又在围绕着重选总裁问题进行着激烈的斗争。在“反主流派”提名松村谦三为总裁候选人来和岸信介对抗的情况下，“主流派”想通过1月24日提前改选总裁使岸信介重新当政的企图也将遇到困难。难道来自自由民主党内部的困难也是“来自外国的扰乱活动”吗？
    应当指出，日本的经济危机是使岸信介集团进一步感到地位不稳的重要因素。难道岸信介能够从由资本主义经济规律所产生的经济危机中寻找出和“来自外国的扰乱活动”有关的口实吗？
    看来岸信介倒是真的耽心“自由阵营以不安的神色注视着我们”这一事实。据美联社去年12月29日报道，“美国正在密切注意岸信介首相在他的内阁的三位阁员辞职之后面临的政治威胁”。美国的官方人士承认，“在岸信介执政期间，美国和日本的关系一直很良好。但是没有人认为他是唯一能够保持这种关系的日本领袖”。岸信介显然是在耽心失宠于美国主子。
    据“日本经济新闻”不久前报道，日本垄断资本集团对岸信介感到失望，严厉地申斥着岸信介，甚至在垄断资本集团中有人开始考虑成立第三党的问题。
    岸信介把日本政局的不安说成是由于“来自外国的扰乱活动”的作法，只能说明他在日益加深的危机面前，已经“黔驴技穷”。
