Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th - The Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway is accelerating construction even in the severe winter. Although it is a time of heavy snow and frozen earth, the construction workers are still fighting tenaciously. Currently, most of the ten large bridges, ten tunnels, over ten million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and over four hundred small bridges and culverts along the approximately 200-kilometer section from Hekou to Xining have been completed. The basic roadbed is taking shape, and track laying has begun on the section entering Qinghai.

The scene of building roads in the snow and ice is very moving. On many snow-covered construction sites, one can see people bustling about and vehicles coming and going everywhere. The more than 40,000 farmers, cadres, workers, students, and railway construction workers of all ethnic groups in Qinghai work from dawn to dusk. Leading Party and government cadres of Qinghai Province also dig and transport earthwork with the workers in the chilling wind.

The workers have come up with various methods to overcome the difficulty of insufficient cold-proof materials. They make their own grass curtains by cutting grass and weaving them, and use methods such as covering with loose fine soil, blocking with broken wooden boards, and covering with discarded cement paper bags to do a good job in the cold protection of the project. Some construction sections have manufactured ice sleds themselves, walking on the ice and snow, greatly increasing transportation efficiency, thereby accelerating the progress of the project. The Second Engineering Team of the 306th Engineering District went deep into mobilizing the masses, overcame the severe cold, and carried out rapid construction, so that the main project of the Shataochuan Bridge, which was originally planned to be completed in twenty days at the earliest, was completed in less than fifteen days.

The winter railway construction workers have received support and care from all sides. The cotton clothes, leather clothes, gloves, felt hats, mattresses, leather hats, and other cold-proof supplies they need have been adequately supplied, and stoves have been installed in the workers' residences as much as possible.

### 风雪工地车水马龙  兰青铁路冬季大施工

    风雪工地车水马龙
    兰青铁路冬季大施工
    新华社西宁6日电　兰青铁路在严寒的冬季里仍在加速施工。目前虽是大雪纷飞、冻土盈尺的日子，但筑路职工们仍然顽强地战斗着。现在河口到西宁段约二百公里线路上的十座大桥、十条隧道、一千多万土石方和四百多座小桥涵工程，大部分已经完成，路基雏形已经展现出来，进入青海境的一段线路已开始铺轨。
    在冰天雪地里筑路的情景是十分感动人的。许多白雪皑皑的工地上，到处可以看到人头钻动，车水马龙。参加筑路的四万多名青海各族农民、干部、职工、学生和筑路职工，都起早贪黑地工作。青海省党政领导干部也在寒风凛烈的日子和职工一道挖运土方。
    职工们想出多种办法来克服防寒材料不足的困难。他们自己动手割草编织草帘，并用松细土掩、破木板挡、废水泥纸袋盖等等办法，做好工程防寒工作。有的施工地段自己制造了冰滑车，在冰雪上行走，使运输效率大大提高，从而也加快了工程进度。三零六工区第二工程队深入发功群众，战胜严寒，大搞快速施工，使原来计划最快要二十天才能完成的沙淘川大桥主体工程，在不到十五天的时间内就完成了。
    冬季筑路职工受到了各方面的支援和关怀。他们需要的棉衣、皮衣、手套、毡帽、褥子、皮帽等御寒用品，都得到了较为充足的供应，职工住处都尽量安上了火炉。
