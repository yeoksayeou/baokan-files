    Smash the Pig Snout Sticking into Our Vegetable Garden
    Speech by Tong Delu, Representative of Farmers from the Suburbs of Beijing
    Comrades, Fellow Compatriots:
    A few days ago, we read in the newspapers that the Cuban people had overthrown the dictatorial rule that was riding on the backs of the people and embarked on the road of independence and democracy. We also saw the news of the Congolese people's struggle against Belgian colonial rule for national independence. We were truly filled with joy. It is just as Chairman Mao said: the enemy is rotting away day by day. The 2.8 million farmers in our suburbs wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for independence, freedom, and democracy.
    When we were resting from work, we read in the newspapers that the Cuban provisional government, in accordance with the demands of the people, punished those executioners who massacred the people. We felt particularly happy in our hearts, just as we felt when we saw the government suppress counter-revolutionaries after the liberation of Beijing. Many commune members said when they heard this passage read, "These bad eggs deserve to be killed, deserve to be killed!" But the American imperialists, those bad guys, came out to rant and rave, saying that the Cuban people's suppression of counter-revolutionaries was "inhumane," and even wanted to directly interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, wanting to let their running dog Batista go back to rule the people again. This is simply a dream! The anti-imperialist demonstration of one million people in Cuba gave them a hard slap in the face. We want to warn the American imperialists that the Cuban people are perfectly justified in suppressing murderers and traitors. If anyone is not reconciled and runs into someone else's vegetable garden like a wild boar, its pig snout will definitely be smashed to pieces by the Cuban people.
    The Congo affair is even more infuriating to hear about. The newspapers reported that Belgian colonialists ruled the Congolese people for eighty years, leaving only a little over ten million people out of the thirty million Congolese. On average, 220,000 people were tormented to death or killed each year. The lives of the Congolese people are even more miserable than those of our Chinese peasants before liberation. The Congolese people can no longer tolerate the brutal rule and cruel exploitation of the Belgian colonialists. They have risen up to oppose the Belgian colonialists and shouted the slogan "Long Live Congolese Independence!" The Belgian colonialists vainly attempt to suppress the anger of the people with bayonets and machine guns. We warn them that the Congolese people's struggle is not isolated. The Chinese people support them, and progressive people all over the world are also supporting them. The Belgian colonialists using machine guns to mow down unarmed demonstrators has aroused our enormous anger. This is simply not something a human being would do; it is the act of beasts! The more frenzied the Belgian colonialists become, the more they show their fear of the people and the weakness of their power, and the sooner they will be finished. We demand that the Belgian authorities immediately recognize the independence of the Congo and immediately release the arrested people.
    Since the realization of people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs have been integrated, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have been comprehensively developed. Production is more vigorous, we have a clearer understanding of the good life we will lead in the future, and we feel that there is even more to look forward to. We simply hate the way that outwardly strong but inwardly weak imperialists always want to bully people and ride on the backs of the people. Although we are so far away from the Cuban and Congolese people, our hearts are connected. We firmly support their anti-imperialist struggles.
    Final victory will surely belong to the Cuban and Congolese people!
    No American interference in Cuba's internal affairs!
    Belgian colonialists, get back to Europe!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

### 打烂伸到菜园来的猪嘴  北京市郊区农民代表佟德禄的讲话

    打烂伸到菜园来的猪嘴
    北京市郊区农民代表佟德禄的讲话同志们，同胞们：
    前几天，我们从报上看到古巴人民推翻了骑在人民头上的独裁统治，走上了独立民主道路的消息，也看到了刚果人民反对比利时殖民主义统治，争取民族独立斗争的消息，我们真是满心高兴，这真是像毛主席说的：敌人一天天烂下去。我们郊区二百八十万农民全心全意地支持古巴和刚果人民争取独立、自由和民主的斗争。
    我们在干活休息时，念到报上说，古巴临时政府顺应人民的要求，惩治那些屠杀人民的刽子手时，心眼里特别痛快，就像北京解放后看到政府镇压反革命那样痛快，好些社员听到念这一段，都说：“这些坏蛋，该杀，该杀！”可偏偏美帝国主义者这些坏家伙们又出来瞎嚷嚷，说古巴人民镇压反革命是“不人道”，还想直接干涉古巴内政，想让他们的走狗巴蒂斯塔重新回去统治人民，这简直是作梦！古巴一百万人的反帝大示威狠狠地打了他们一个大嘴巴。我们要警告美帝国主义者，古巴人民完全应该镇压杀人犯和卖国贼，谁要是不甘心，还像一支野猪一样跑到别人菜园子里乱拱，它的猪嘴一定会被古巴人民打个稀烂。
    刚果的事情听起来更叫人气炸了肺。报上说，比利时殖民主义者统治了刚果人民八十年，使三千万人的刚果，现在只剩下一千多万人，每年被折磨死的加上被杀死的平均就有二十二万人。刚果人民的生活真比咱们中国农民解放前还惨。刚果人民已经不能再忍受比利时殖民主义者的野蛮统治和残酷剥削了，已经起来反对比利时殖民主义者，喊出了“刚果独立万岁！”的口号。比利时殖民主义者妄想用刺刀、机关枪来压服人民的怒火，我们警告他们，刚果人民的斗争不是孤立的，中国人民支持他们，全世界进步的人民也在支持他们。比利时殖民主义者用机枪扫射手无寸铁的示威群众，惹起了我们巨大的愤怒，这简直不是人办的事情，是畜类！比利时殖民者愈是疯狂，就愈显出他们对人民的害怕和力量的虚弱，就完蛋得更早。我们要求比利时当局立即承认刚果的独立，立即释放被捕的人民。
    我们北京郊区的农民，在实现人民公社以后，工农商学兵互相结合，农林牧副渔全面发展，生产更有劲了，对将来要过的好日子认得更清了，觉得奔头更大了。我们对外强中干的帝国主义者总想欺负人，总想骑在人民头上的事情简直恨透了。我们虽然离古巴和刚果人民那么远，我们和他们心连着心，我们坚决支持他们的反帝斗争。
    最后胜利一定属于古巴和刚果人民！
    不许美国干涉古巴内政！
    比利时殖民主义者滚回欧洲去！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
