    Strive to Guarantee Quality
    The news from Shanghai's major iron and steel plants and Yunnan's Jinning County Satellite Reservoir published in today's newspaper touches on the issue of guaranteeing quality. This is a very important aspect of production and capital construction.

    Our guiding principle for production and construction is "more, faster, better, and more economical." This is a dialectically unified and complete principle, and no aspect should be neglected. It is wrong to only focus on "more, faster, and more economical" while neglecting "better." Similarly, it is wrong to only focus on "better" while neglecting "more, faster, and more economical."

    In production, especially in industrial production, the quality of products will affect a series of other links. In capital construction, especially in newly built factories, water conservancy projects, and other projects, guaranteeing quality is a matter of long-term importance. Vigorously grasping quality is a problem that needs special attention at present.

    To vigorously grasp quality and fully implement the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," we must, under the unified leadership of the Party, implement the "three-way combination" of administrative personnel, technical personnel, and workers, and fully mobilize everyone. We must earnestly study technology under the guidance of politics and establish and improve some necessary rules and regulations. The rules and regulations that existed in the past and are still suitable should continue to be used and should not be abolished casually. Furthermore, we must formulate some new systems and operating procedures based on the practice of production and construction to strengthen organizational management and technical management. As long as we do it conscientiously, we will definitely be able to achieve high output and high quality, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    力保质量
    本报今天发表的上海各大型钢铁厂和云南晋宁县卫星水库的消息中，谈到了保证质量的问题，这是生产工作和基本建设中的一个很重要的方面。
    我们生产建设的方针是多、快、好、省，这是一个辩证统一的完整的方针，任何一方面都不可偏废。那种只要多、快、省，而不要好，是不对的；同样，那种只要好，而不要多、快、省，也是不对的。
    在生产工作中，特别是在工业生产中，产品质量的好坏，将影响到其它一系列的环节；在基本建设中，特别是新建的工厂、水利等工程，保证质量，更是百年大计。狠狠地抓质量，是当前需要特别加以注意的问题。
    要大抓质量，全面地贯彻多、快、好、省的方针，就一定要在党的统一的领导下，实行行政人员、技术人员和工人的三结合，把大家充分地发动起来；就一定要在政治挂帅下，认真地钻研技术，并建立和健全一些必要的规章制度。过去已有、现在还适合的规章制度，应该继续使用，不要随便废除；并且还要根据生产和建设的实践，制订一些新的制度和操作规程，加强组织管理和技术管理。只要我们认真去做，就一定能做到高产又高质，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
