The Party Cultivated Me to Be a Teacher
Li Naihua, Worker at Tianjin Pen Factory

The buzzer had just rung for the start of the shift when I began operating the machine to cut copper wire and make the copper tips for ballpoint pens. These pens sell even faster than fountain pens, so we have to work extra hard to meet the people's needs for cultural life.

I had only recently learned this process and wasn't very skilled at it yet. As I was working, Director Wang of the workshop came towards me with a smile. I thought, "Is he smiling at my lack of skill?" I was about to ask him when he spoke first:

"Xiao Li, come here, I want to tell you something."

"Okay." I left the machine and followed Director Wang to the workshop office.

"The factory has decided to send you to study. Our factory is preparing to establish a part-work, part-study political and technical school, and they may ask you to be a teacher..."

"Good heavens!" I was a little nervous when I heard this, and I blurted out, "I can learn how to do the work, but I can't be a teacher..."

"If you couldn't do it, the factory wouldn't ask you," Director Wang said. "Go to the factory office. You might have to register immediately."

I took off my apron, washed the oil off my hands, put on my cotton coat, and left the workshop to go to the office.

On the way, I thought a lot. For some reason, I remembered the scene when I first arrived in the city.

More than eight years ago, I came to Tianjin and became an apprentice in a small factory. I was only fourteen years old that year, and not very tall. After entering the factory, no one called me by my name; they all called me "Little Dot." I only went to elementary school for three years at home and couldn't even write a letter. When I saw that there was a workers' spare-time school, I was very eager to go to study. At that time, the capitalists were very opposed to my going to school. After the "Five-Anti Campaign," the capitalists no longer prevented me from going to school. It was the Party that gave me back the opportunity to study.

My education level has grown year by year, and now I have reached the cultural level of a high school student. My parents couldn't afford to send me to school, but the Party had a way, and I have endless gratitude. Now, I have been given another task—to be a teacher. How could I refuse?

I arrived at the office. Party Branch Secretary Li and Labor Union Chairman Lao Cui rushed to pull up a chair for me, and another rushed to pour me water. My eyes were moistened by this scene, and I quickly wiped them before sitting down.

"Do you have confidence in being a teacher?" Secretary Li said. "Being a worker and teaching at the same time, how about it?"

"I'm afraid I can't do it, I haven't done it before, I've been a worker since I was a child..." I said.

"That's right!" Labor Union Chairman Lao Cui said, "Precisely because you are a worker, the Party is cultivating workers. Workers must be all-powerful!"

"Do it," Secretary Li said. "Everything is created by workers. Now, after workers have studied philosophy, they can even write editorials! Young man, do it! This is the task the Party has given you!"

With the leaders saying this, how could I refuse? This is originally our own business! So I said, "Okay, I'll go to study!" The branch secretary and labor union chairman were all happy.

I am studying junior high school Chinese at the Red and Expert Rapid Teacher Training School. In the future, after I finish my studies and return to the factory, I will teach junior high school courses for the workers' part-work, part-study program.

During my studies, I work in the morning and study in the afternoon. This is not bad at all. I have never experienced this kind of life before. Now, mental and physical strength are combined. The more I learn, the more motivated I become, because this is the Party's cultivation of me, no, it is also to cultivate more and more workers! I feel the importance of learning, and I know that I have this responsibility.

    党培养我当教师
    天津制笔厂工人　李乃华
    上班电铃刚响过，我便操纵着机器截铜丝，制做圆珠笔的铜头儿。这种笔比金笔销的还快，所以我们必须要紧上加紧，好供给人民文化生活需要。
    我是最近刚学会这道工序的，干起来还不很熟。我正干着活儿，车间的王主任笑着向我走来，我心里说：“笑我干的不熟吗？”我正想问他，他倒抢着先说了：
    “小李，你来我给你说个事儿。”
    “好。”我就离开机器，跟着王主任，来到车间办公室。
    “厂里研究决定，叫你去学习，咱厂准备也搞半工半读的政治技术学校，可能叫你当教师……”
    “好家伙！”我一听，心里有些紧张，便抢着说：“干活学一学就会了，当教师我可不行……”
    “不行厂里也不叫你当，”王主任说：“你到厂办公室去一趟吧，可能马上就去报到。”
    我把围裙解下，洗净油手，穿上棉衣，离开车间，到办公室去。
    一路上，我想的很多。不知道为什么，又想起了我刚进城时的情景来。
    八年多前，我来到了天津，在一家小工厂当学徒。我那年才十四岁，个子长得也不高，进厂后，没有人喊我的名字，都管我叫“小不点儿”。我在家只上了三年小学，连信也不会写。我一看有了工人业余学校，很愿意去学习。当时，资本家很不同意我去上学。经过“五反”以后，资本家才不阻挡我上学了，是党给我夺回了上学的机会。
    我的文化一年年的向上长，现在已经达到了高中的文化水平。爹娘没法叫我上学，党有办法，我有说不尽的感激心情。现在，又给我一个任务——当教师，能说不干吗？
    我来到办公室里，党支部李书记和工会主席老崔，一个抢着给我搬凳子；一个抢着给我倒水，我的眼被这种情景触湿了，赶紧一揩，就坐下了。
    “当教师有信心吗？”李支书说：“又是工人又教学，怎么样？”
    “怕不行，没干过，我从小就当工人……”我说。
    “是呀！”工会主席老崔说：“正因为你是工人，党才培养工人，工人要万能！”
    “干吧，”李支书说：“什么都是工人创造的。现在，工人学了哲学以后，还能写社论呢！小伙子，干吧！这是党给你的任务！”
    领导上这么一讲，我还能推辞吗？这原是我们自己的事啊！我就说：“好，我就去学习！”支部书记和工会主席全乐了。
    我在红专速成师范学校，学初中语文，将来学完回厂后，就教工人半工半读的初中课程。
    我在学习期间，是上午干活儿，下午学习，这一来，很不坏，我以前从来没有经历这种生活。这一下，脑力和体力结合起来了。我越学越有劲，因为这是党对我的培养，不，也是为了培养更多更多的工人们！我感觉到学习的重要，也知道我有这个责任。
