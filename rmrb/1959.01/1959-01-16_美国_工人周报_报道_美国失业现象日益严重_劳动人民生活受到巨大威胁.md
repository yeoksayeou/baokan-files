U.S. "Workers' Weekly" Reports
    Unemployment in the United States is Increasingly Serious
    Laboring People's Lives Greatly Threatened
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) According to the U.S. "Workers' Weekly" on January 11, unemployment in the United States is increasingly serious, and the lives of the laboring people are greatly threatened.
    Detroit
    In Detroit, official reports show the grim unemployment situation in Michigan. According to the facts released by the Michigan Employment Security Commission: The monthly average number of unemployed people in Michigan is 400,600, accounting for 13.9% of the state's labor force, more than double that of any month in 1957. The monthly average employment in Michigan in 1958 decreased to 2,112,000, a decrease of 233,000 compared with 1957, the lowest monthly average employment since 1949.
    In 1958, the monthly average number of unemployed auto workers was 295,000, 100,000 more than the monthly average in 1957. The overall unemployment situation in 1958 did not include the tens of thousands of people who had reduced working hours and only worked a few days a week.
    In 1958, construction workers were the hardest hit, with an average of 15,000 workers unemployed each month throughout the year. In 1958, the average number of unemployed clerks engaged in wholesale and retail trade was 11,000 per month. In transportation and public utilities, the average number of unemployed people was 7,000 per month in 1958.
    The Employment Security Commission's report avoids mentioning Black workers who are doubly hit by the economic recession and racial discrimination. In 1958, of the more than 150,000 unemployed workers who exhausted their 39 weeks of unemployment benefits, 70% were Black workers. This situation illustrates the impact of racial discrimination. Black people are the first to be laid off because of their shorter seniority. Because unskilled jobs are gradually being automated, eliminating the need for unskilled labor, Black workers are the most affected. 68% of the workers applying for welfare relief are married and unmarried Black workers.
    Cleveland
    In Cleveland newspapers, there are almost daily news reports about "the recession is ending," but in inconspicuous columns, some more accurate reports are often revealed. For example, on December 25, 1958, a newspaper published a report from the Unemployment Relief Bureau in a short article. The report pointed out that in the week ending December 20, 100,1493 people continued to receive unemployment benefits, and in the last week of December, there were another 20,099 new applications.
    Schultz, the head of the business district office of the Ohio Unemployment Service, recently stated in a speech at the "Metropolitan League": "This is a workers' economic recession. Factory workers are the hardest hit." Schultz said that of the 56,000 unemployed workers in November 1958, 40,000 were male workers and 16,000 were female workers. 80% of the unemployed male workers and 60% of the unemployed female workers were factory workers.
    Chicago
    The number of marriage certificates issued in Chicago in 1958 decreased by 5% compared with 1957. Staff handling marriage registration said that due to unemployment, many young men and women postponed their marriage dates, hoping for better days.
    Of the 130,000 construction workers in Chicago, the number of unemployed in 1958 reached 25%, the highest figure in the past decade.

    美国“工人周报”报道
    美国失业现象日益严重
    劳动人民生活受到巨大威胁
    本报讯　据美国“工人周报”1月11日报道，美国各地失业现象日益严重，劳动人民的生活受到很大威胁。底特律
    在底特律，官方机构发布的报告显示了密执安州冷酷的失业情况。据密执安州就业安全委员会所发布的事实：密执安州每月平均失业人数为四十万零六千名，占全州劳动力的13.9％，超过1957年任何月份的一倍。而密执安州1958年每月平均就业人数减为二百一十一万二千，比1957年减少了二十三万三千人，为自1949年以来最低每月平均就业人数。
    1958年，失业汽车工人每月平均为二十九万五千名，比1957年每月平均数字多十万名，在1958年失业总况里，还没有把成千上万缩减了工作时间、每周只有数日工作的人计算进去。
    1958年，受打击最严重的是建筑业工人，全年每月平均有一万五千名工人失业。1958年，从事批发、零售商业的店员，每月平均有一万一千人失业。在交通运输、公用事业方面，1958年每月平均有七千人失业。
    就业安全委员会的报告避免谈到受经济衰退和种族歧视双重打击的黑人工人。而在1958年，十五万名以上用完了为期三十九个星期的失业救济金的失业工人中，70％是黑人工人。这个情况说明了种族歧视的影响。由于工龄较短，首先被解雇的是黑人。由于不需要熟练技术的工作逐渐实行自动化，使不需要熟练技术的工作趋于消灭，黑人工人因此最受影响。申请福利救济的工人68％是已婚的和未婚的黑人工人。克里夫兰
    在克里夫兰的报纸上，几乎每天都有关于“衰退正在结束”一类的消息，但是在不引人注目的栏目里，往往流露了一些比较确实的报道。例如，1958年12月25日，一家报纸在短文中刊载了失业救济金局的一项报告。报告指出，到12月20日为止的一周里，继续领取失业救济金的有十万零一千四百九十三人，而在12月最后一周，又有了二万零九十九份新的申请书。
    俄亥俄州失业服务处商业区办事处的负责人舒尔兹最近在“都会联盟”发表演说称：“这是工人的经济衰退。遭受打击最严重的是工厂工人。”舒尔兹说，在1958年11月的五万六千名失业工人里，四万名是男工，一万六千名是女工，失业工人中80％的男工、60％的女工都是工厂工人。芝加哥
    1958年芝加哥颁发的结婚证书比1957年减少了5％。办理结婚登记的人员说，由于失业的原故，许多青年男女推迟了结婚的日期，期待着较好的日子。
    在芝加哥十三万名建筑工人里，1958年失业的人数达到25％，为十年来最高数字。
