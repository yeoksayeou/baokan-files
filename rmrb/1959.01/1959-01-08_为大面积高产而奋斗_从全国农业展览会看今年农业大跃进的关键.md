Strive for Large-Area, High Yield
    --Key to This Year's Agricultural Great Leap Forward Seen from the National Agricultural Exhibition

    The National Agricultural Exhibition, which opened a few days ago, receives tens of thousands of visitors from all over the country every day. This exhibition is a grand review of China's agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958. From this exhibition, people will see the great achievements and rich experiences accumulated over the past year in China's agriculture, community-run industries, forestry, animal husbandry, and aquaculture, and further strengthen their confidence in winning the victory of a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959.

    The National Agricultural Exhibition first shows people the general picture of the leap forward in all aspects in 1958: the national grain output is expected to reach about 750 billion jin, and the cotton output is expected to reach about 67 million dan, both more than double that of 1957; there have also been significant increases in the production of crops such as peanuts, rapeseed, sesame, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane and sugar beets, and ramie. In terms of animal husbandry, the number of large livestock increased by 6% compared to 1957. The output of aquatic products increased by one and a half times compared to 1957. In forestry, the afforestation area reached 400 million mu, exceeding the total afforestation area in the eight years after liberation. The achievements in water conservancy construction are even more brilliant, with the national irrigated area expanding by 480 million mu, almost equivalent to the original irrigated area (520 million mu). All these achievements vividly prove the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the victory of putting politics in command and the mass line.

    The large number of facts displayed in the National Agricultural Exhibition reflects a prominent feature of the agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958, which is the emergence of large-area, high-yield fields. In the large-area, high-yield fields, there are not only high-yield crops, but also crops that were previously considered low-yield. These large-area, high-yield fields not only appear in historically high-yield areas, but also in low-yield areas that were previously considered difficult to change due to their high altitude, cold climate, and barrenness. According to the introduction at the National Agricultural Exhibition, in terms of wheat, the country has more than 20 million mu of wheat fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, including 15,596 mu of wheat fields with a yield of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, 308 mu of wheat fields with a yield of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, and 95.7 mu of wheat fields with a yield of over 4,000 jin per mu. In terms of cotton, the area with a yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu accounts for 40% of the total cotton field area. In addition, the exhibition also introduced many special zones and counties (banners, cities) that have created large-area high-yield records. These areas have large-area high-yield fields, ranging from several million mu to at least tens of thousands of mu. As for the people's communes that have created large-area high-yield records, there are too many to list.

    The reason why large-area, high-yield fields are attracting more and more widespread attention is that people have found a way for the high-speed development of China's agriculture from the experience of large-area, high yields, which is also the way for the great revolution in China's agricultural production. Since liberation, China's agricultural production has developed rapidly on the basis of land reform and cooperation, and grain production can already ensure that the people of the whole country have enough food. And it provides more raw materials for industry. This is something that no dynasty in Chinese history could have done. However, we must also see that the backward state of agricultural cultivation techniques in our country has not been fundamentally changed. Because of this, in a large country with a population of more than 600 million, 200 to 300 million people still need to work hard in the fields year after year to solve the problem of food. This situation not only affects the great development of agriculture itself, but also affects the development speed of industrial construction and other constructions of the country. In order to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science, and modern culture as soon as possible, we must do our best to change the above situation. The experience of large-area, high yields provides us with a method, which is to change extensive farming and low yields into intensive farming and high yields. By doing this, we can obtain enough agricultural products on less cultivated land, so we can put a large amount of labor saved from agriculture into industry, forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, sideline occupations, and various economic and cultural constructions. The "Ten Proposals" put forward by the recently concluded National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction especially emphasized the importance of developing large-area high-yield fields, and required each people's commune to set aside 20% of the sown area this year to cultivate high-yield fields, which is the reason for this.

    The large-scale emergence of large-area, high-yield fields is not accidental, but the result of implementing the "eight-character charter" of "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management" for increasing production. The National Agricultural Exhibition uses abundant facts to convincingly prove that no matter what region or what crop, whoever actively and appropriately implements the "eight-character charter" according to local conditions will achieve high yields. In the "Measures for Increasing Production Hall" of the exhibition, many contrasting charts were displayed, vividly illustrating the huge role of the "eight-character charter" in increasing production. For example, the Jianggu People's Commune in Guangsi County, Guangdong Province, used to only plow shallowly to a depth of three to four inches, and the annual yield of rice per mu was only 300 to 400 jin; in 1958, the late rice was generally deeply plowed to a depth of seven to eight inches to one foot or more, and at the same time, fertilizer application and technical measures were implemented, resulting in an average yield per mu that soared to 3,250 jin. The increase in yield of the late rice fields in the Jianggu town suburb of this commune due to deep plowing was the most obvious: under the same other measures, those plowed to a depth of seven to eight inches yielded 3,200 jin per mu; those plowed to a depth of one foot and two inches yielded 3,800 jin per mu; and those plowed to a depth of one foot and five inches yielded 4,600 jin per mu. Similar examples can be found in many places at the agricultural exhibition. In addition, the exhibition also introduced specific experiences in rational irrigation, layered fertilization, multiple top dressings, the manufacture and utilization of soil fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer, all of which have been affirmed by the facts of large-area high yields in various places. In the "Measures for Increasing Production Hall," there is also a large chart summarizing the close planting experience of various places, which shows that the measures for close planting to obtain a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu are: wheat is sown at 18 to 40 jin per mu, with 400,000 to 800,000 ears per mu; rice is transplanted with more than 30,000 seedlings per mu, with 400,000 ears per mu; and peanuts have more than 18,000 to 25,000 plants per mu. As for the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, the example of Yanbei Special Zone in Shanxi Province exhibited at the exhibition is the most convincing. In 1954, this special zone suffered a major epidemic of potato late blight, and each mu of potatoes yielded only 357 jin; in 1958, hundreds of thousands of people were mobilized to carry out four "encirclements" of potato late blight, resulting in a bumper harvest of 2,200 jin of potatoes per mu. In the materials displayed at the National Agricultural Exhibition, there are many such examples of obtaining large-area high yields by implementing the "eight-character charter," which cannot be cited one by one here. From the listed examples alone, the close relationship between the "eight-character charter" and large-area high yields can already be clearly seen.

    In the agricultural production of 1958, many people did not have a deep enough understanding of the importance of the "eight-character charter" and the interrelationship between the eight characters, so they did not do enough in consciously applying the "eight-character charter" in production practice. But despite this, we still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This shows that China's agricultural production still has great potential and great possibilities for a greater leap forward. Now people have seen from practice that implementing the "eight-character charter" can enable China's agricultural production to achieve a greater leap forward and enable the unit area yield of our country to increase several times. This makes it possible for us to gradually change the extensive farming system with low yields and implement a new farming system with less planting and more harvesting, deep plowing and intensive farming.

    How to cultivate large-area, high-yield fields? The National Agricultural Exhibition gave a clear answer based on the practical experience of various places: we should implement the gardening of cultivated land. Gardening, characterized by a high degree of intensive farming, is an important creation of Chinese farmers. Its purpose is to obtain very high yields per unit area. Gardening can be said to be a set of high-standard and meticulous farming methods from planting to harvesting. If it is said that general farmland needs to implement the "eight-character charter," then farmland implementing gardening must implement the "eight-character charter" according to higher specifications and standards. Gardening is a concentrated expression of the comprehensive implementation of the "eight-character charter." In the Grain Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition, the achievements of Anguo County in gardening were comprehensively introduced. Anguo County realized the gardening of wheat planting in 1958, and the 183,000 mu of winter wheat in the county achieved an average yield of 491 jin per mu. Since the autumn plowing and autumn planting in 1958, many regions across the country have begun to promote this experience. It can be predicted that due to the promotion of gardening farming methods, there will be large-area, high-yield fields with larger areas and higher yields in 1959. This is the key to achieving a greater bumper harvest in 1959.

    The National Agricultural Exhibition not only shows the great achievements of China's agricultural Great Leap Forward in the past year, but also provides us with rich experience in developing agriculture, and clearly points out the huge potential for increased production and the far-reaching development prospects of China's agriculture. We should earnestly study these experiences, especially the experience of large-area high yields, and vigorously promote them in combination with the specific conditions of our regions, so as to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front in 1959.

    为大面积高产而奋斗
    ——从全国农业展览会看今年农业大跃进的关键
    几天前开幕的全国农业展览会每天接待来自全国各地的成千成万的观众。这个展览会是对1958年我国农业大跃进的大检阅。从这个展览会里，人们会看到一年来我国的农业、社办工业、林业、畜牧业、水产业等方面的伟大成果和集中起来的丰富的经验，更加坚定了争取1959年农业更大跃进的胜利信心。
    全国农业展览会首先向人们展示了1958年各方面跃进的概貌：全国粮食产量预计将达七千五百亿斤左右，棉花产量预计将达六千七百万担左右，两者都比1957年增长了一倍以上；花生、油菜、芝麻、烤烟、甘蔗和甜菜、苎麻等作物也有很大的增产。在畜牧业方面，大家畜比1957年增加了6％。水产品产量比1957年增加一倍半。林业方面造林面积达到四亿亩，超过解放后八年造林面积的总和。水利建设方面，成就更加辉煌，全国灌溉面积扩大了四亿八千万亩，几乎相当原有的灌溉面积（五亿二千万亩）。所有这些成果，都生动地证明了党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，证明了政治挂帅、群众路线的胜利。
    全国农业展览会中展出的大量事实反映了1958年农业大跃进一个突出的特点，就是大面积高产田的出现。在大面积丰产田中，不仅有高产作物，而且有过去被认为是低产的作物。这些大面积高产田不仅出现在历史上的高产地区，而且也出现在过去一贯被认为难于改变的高寒贫瘠的低产地区。根据全国农业展览会上的介绍，在小麦方面，亩产一千斤以上的麦田全国已达二千多万亩，其中亩产二千斤到三千斤的麦田有一万五千五百九十六亩、三千斤到四千斤的麦田有三百零八亩、四千斤以上的麦田有九十五点七亩。在棉花方面，亩产皮棉百斤以上的就占棉田总面积40％。此外，展览会还介绍了许多创造大面积高产纪录的专区和县（旗、市），这些地区的大面积高产田，多的达几百万亩，最少的也有几万亩。至于创造大面积高产纪录的人民公社就更多得不胜列举了。
    大面积高产田之所以愈来愈引起广泛的重视，是因为人们从大面积高产的经验中找到了我国农业高速度发展的途径，也就是我国农业生产大革命的途径。解放以来，我国农业生产在土地改革和合作化的基础上有了迅速发展，粮食生产已经可以保证全国人民有足够的口粮。并且为工业提供了更多的原料。这是我国历史上任何朝代不可能做到的事情。但是，我们还必须看到，我国农业耕作技术的落后状况还没有根本改变。因为这个缘故，在一个六亿多人口的大国里，还需要两三亿人终年累月地在田间辛勤劳动，以解决吃饭问题。这种状况不仅影响了农业本身的大发展，而且影响工业建设和其他各项建设的发展速度。为了早日把我国建成为现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，我们必须尽最大努力改变上述的状况。大面积高产的经验，就为我们提供了办法，这就是变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为精耕细作、少种多收。这样做以后，就可以在较少的耕地上获得足够的农产品，因而就可以把从农业方面节省下来的大量的劳动力投入工业和林业、畜牧业、水产业、副业等各种经济建设和文化建设中去。不久前闭幕的全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所提出的“十大倡议”中，特别强调大搞大面积高产田，并且要求每个人民公社今年拿出占播种面积20％的耕地来培植高产田，就是这个道理。
    大面积高产田的大量出现，并不是偶然的，这是贯彻“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八大增产措施的结果。全国农业展览会用丰富的事实令人信服地证明：不论什么地区，也不论是什么农作物，凡是积极地因地制宜地贯彻了“八字宪法”的，就获得了高额丰产。在展览会的“增产措施馆”里，展出了很多对比鲜明的图表，生动地说明“八字宪法”对增产的巨大作用。例如：广东省广四县江谷人民公社一向只浅耕三至四寸，每年亩产稻谷只有三、四百斤；1958年的晚稻普遍深耕七、八寸到一尺以上，同时贯彻了增施肥料和技术措施，结果平均亩产量猛增到三千二百五十斤。这个公社的江谷镇郊区的晚稻田因深耕而增产的情况最明显：在其他措施相同的条件下，深耕七寸到八寸的，亩产三千二百斤；深耕一尺二寸的，亩产三千八百斤；深耕一尺五寸的，亩产四千六百斤。类似的例子，在农业展览会上还可以找到好多。此外，展览会还介绍了合理灌溉、分层施肥、多次追肥、土化肥和细菌肥料的制造和利用等具体经验，这些经验都已为各地大面积高产的事实所肯定。在“增产措施馆”中，还有一大幅概括了各地的密植经验的图表说明，凡是获得每亩千斤以上的产量的，密植的措施是：小麦每亩播种十八到四十斤，每亩有穗四十万到八十万株以上；水稻每亩插秧三万多兜，每亩有穗四十万株；花生每亩多在一万八千至二万五千株以上。至于防治病虫害，展览会展出的山西省雁北专区的事例最有说服力，这个专区1954年因马铃薯晚疫病大流行，每亩马铃薯只收三百五十七斤；1958年动员了几十万人进行了四次“围剿”马铃薯晚疫病，结果获得了每亩产马铃薯二千二百斤的大丰收。在全国农业展览会所展示的材料中，像这样因为贯彻“八字宪法”而获得大面积高产的事例多得很，这里不能一一引述。仅从列举的这些事例中，就已经可以明显地看出“八字宪法”与大面积高产的密切关系了。
    在1958年的农业生产中，许多人对于“八字宪法”的重要性和八者之间的相互关系还认识得不够深刻，因而在生产实践中自觉地运用“八字宪法”方面还作得不够。但是，尽管这样，我们还是获得了空前的大丰收。这就说明我国的农业生产，还有极大的潜力，还有更大跃进的巨大可能性。现在人们已经从实践中看到：贯彻“八字宪法”，就可以使我国的农业生产获得更大的跃进，就能够使我国的单位面积产量成倍地增长。这就使我们有可能逐步地改变广种薄收、浅耕粗作的耕作制度，实行少种多收、深耕细作的新的耕作制度。
    怎样培植大面积高产田？全国农业展览会根据各地的实践的经验作了明确的回答：应该实行耕作园田化。以高度的精耕细作为特点的园田化，是我国农民的一项重要创造。它的目的，就是获得很高的单位面积产量。园田化可以说是从耕种到收获的一套高标准的精细的耕作方法。如果说，一般农田需要贯彻“八字宪法”，那末实行园田化的农田就必须按照更高的规格和标准来贯彻“八字宪法”。园田化是“八字宪法”全面贯彻的集中表现。在全国农业展览会的粮食馆里，全面地介绍了安国县园田化的成就。安国县在1958年实现了种麦园田化，全县十八万三千亩冬小麦，获得了平均亩产四百九十一斤的丰产成绩。这个经验，从1958年秋耕秋种的时候起，全国已有不少地区开始推广。可以预料，由于园田化的耕作方法的推广，1959年将会出现面积更大、产量更高的大面积高产田。这是实现1959年更大丰收的关键。
    全国农业展览会不但显示了一年来我国农业大跃进的伟大成就，而且向我们提供了发展农业的丰富的经验，明确指出了我国农业的巨大增产潜力和远大的发展前途。我们应当认真地研究、学习这些经验，特别是大面积高产的经验结合本地区的具体情况大力加以推广，以便在1959年的农业战线上取得更大更好更全面的跃进。
