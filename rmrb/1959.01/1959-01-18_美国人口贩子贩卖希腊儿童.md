Xinhua News Agency, Athens, January 15th: Newspapers report that a gang of American human traffickers is operating in Greece, selling Greek children.

    "Dawn" newspaper writes that these villains come to Greece, pretending to be wealthy Americans, and "adopt" Greek children as stepchildren. Sometimes they buy these children at very low prices. Once in the United States, they auction these children off at prices ranging from two thousand to three thousand dollars each. According to some very incomplete materials from the Greek Ministry of Social Welfare published in "Daily News," they transported 526 children to the United States between September 1, 1957, and December 1, 1958.

    贩卖希腊儿童
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社雅典15日讯：报纸报道，贩卖希腊儿童的一帮美国人在希腊进行活动。
      “黎明日报”写道，这帮恶棍来到希腊，佯称是美国富翁，把希腊儿童“收为继子”。有时他们花很小的代价买下这些儿童。到美国，他们将这些儿童按每个二千至三千美元的价格拍卖。根据“每日新闻”刊登的希腊社会福利部一些很不完全的材料，1957年9月1日至1958年12月1日，他们运往美国去的儿童有五百二十六个。
