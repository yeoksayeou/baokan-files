    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 26th: While ice skating and skiing athletes in the north are racing across the ice and snow, Guangdong Province, from Hainan to northern Guangdong, is carrying out mass winter open-air cold water swimming activities.
    In Dongguan and Huazhou (formerly Wu Chuan County and Hua County), where swimming activities are better developed, more than 10,000 people regularly participate in winter swimming exercises. More than 80% of the Dongguan County Juvenile Amateur Sports School has winter swimming programs. In addition, the vast majority of people's communes in the county have organized winter swimming teams, with more than 3,000 members of the Daojiao Commune participating in winter swimming. With the exception of a few who are physically unsuitable for swimming, teachers and students of Shimen Middle School in Nanhai County regularly participate in winter swimming exercises. In other counties such as Lechang and Luoding, which are located in mountainous and hilly areas, people also frequently use rivers, streams, and ponds for winter swimming activities.
    Based on the widespread development of winter swimming activities throughout the province, the Guangdong Provincial Sports Commission held a provincial winter swimming sports conference in Xinhui County from January 22nd to 25th.

    广东开展群众性冬季游泳活动
    新华社广州26日电　正当北国溜冰滑雪健儿在冰雪上驰骋的时候，广东省从海南到粤北正在开展群众性的冬季露天冷水游泳运动。
    在游泳运动开展得比较好的东莞、化州（原吴川县、化县）两县，经常参加冬泳锻炼的群众都在一万人以上。东莞县的青少年业余体育学校80％以上都有冬泳项目。此外，全县绝大部分人民公社都组织有冬泳队，其中道滘公社参加冬泳的社员有三千多人。南海县石门中学的师生除少数身体条件不适宜于参加游泳运动以外，都经常进行冬泳锻炼。其他如处在山区和丘陵地区的乐昌、罗定等县的群众，也经常利用河溪、池塘进行冬泳活动。
    广东省体育运动委员会在全省冬泳运动广泛开展的基础上，1月22日到25日曾在新会县举行了全省冬季游泳运动大会。
