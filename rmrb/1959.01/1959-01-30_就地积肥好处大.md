On-site Manure Accumulation Has Great Benefits
    Zeng Zhi
    In the nationwide campaign to accumulate and create fertilizer, many places have created methods for accumulating and applying fertilizer on-site. Bo'ai County, Henan Province, launched the "Thousand Mu Hundred Pools" movement, composting fertilizer on-site and applying it on-site. Liling County, Hunan Province, while vigorously accumulating household manure, also focused on field pond fertilizer in various places. The county has already built more than 260,000 large ponds in the fields, capable of composting 80 million dan.

    These methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer on-site are good experiences accumulated by the local masses from years of production practice, and are worth vigorously promoting and popularizing. Adopting these methods can greatly save labor. According to our production situation over the years, a large part of the labor force in agricultural production is used for transportation, and the largest proportion of transportation is fertilizer. Calculating on the basis of 30,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, if it is carried by people, it would take 300 trips back and forth to get the accumulated fertilizer to the field. The country has more than one billion mu of cultivated land. If fertilizer were transported like this, how much labor would it consume? This is just to get the already accumulated and manufactured fertilizer to the field. If we add up the labor needed to accumulate and create fertilizer bit by bit, then even more labor would be needed. Various places have already transferred a large amount of labor from other aspects of agricultural production to the front line of accumulating, creating, and transporting fertilizer. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have also called on everyone, regardless of city or countryside, to take action and every household to accumulate fertilizer. These measures are completely correct and necessary. However, increasing the labor force does not mean that we should not save labor. Saving labor on the fertilizer front is still a very important issue.

    On-site accumulation and creation of fertilizer can not only save a large amount of labor for transporting fertilizer, but also be beneficial to hygiene. In the past, due to the limitations of the individual economy, people had to accumulate fertilizer at home, on the streets, and next to villages. In addition, the management was not always reasonable. In the summer, it was easy to breed flies and maggots and spread diseases. After collectivization, the conditions have changed. The commune not only has the full strength to change this situation and improve environmental sanitation, but also can fully arrange, according to the production development plan and the specific situation of each management area and production team, where to build pigsties and cattle pens, where to build soil fertilizer plants, where to dig composting ponds and pits, where to build toilets, etc., to implement on-site material collection, on-site accumulation of fertilizer, on-site fertilizer production, and on-site application. Of course, building pigsties and toilets on the edge of fields, digging composting ponds and pits, etc., also requires a certain amount of labor, and keeping pigs and sheep in the wild may also increase some trouble in feeding management. However, compared with the benefits of on-site accumulation and creation of fertilizer, these are just small troubles and small expenditures. Being afraid of these small troubles and being reluctant to spend this small amount will not allow us to achieve greater results in the overall account of the rational use of labor.

    就地积肥好处大
    曾志
    在全国大搞积肥造肥运动中，很多地方创造了就地积肥、施肥的方法。河南省博爱县开展了“千亩百池”运动，就地沤肥、就地施用。湖南醴陵县在大积家肥的同时，各地都抓住了田间凼肥。全县已在田头建立大凼二十六万多个，可沤八千万担。
    这些就地积肥、造肥的办法，都是当地群众从多年的生产实践中积累起来的好经验，值得大大提倡和推广。采取这些办法，可以大大节省劳动力。按照我们历年生产的情况，在农业生产中，有很大一部分劳力是用在运输上，而运输中占比重最大的又是肥料。以一亩地施三万斤肥计算，如果用人挑的话，就得挑三百次走三百个来回，才能把积好的肥送到地里。全国有十几亿亩耕地，如果都这样运肥的话，那要耗费多少个劳动力？这还仅仅是把已经积、制好的肥料送到地里去，如果再要算上一点一滴地积肥、造肥，那末需要的劳动力就更多了。各地已从农业生产的其它方面给积肥造肥运肥战线抽调了大量的劳动力，党中央和国务院还号召不分城市和农村，人人动手，户户积肥。这些措施是完全正确的，必要的。但是增加劳动力，并不等于不要节约劳动力。在肥料战线上节约劳动力，还是一个十分重要的问题。
    就地积肥、造肥不但可以节省大批运肥的劳动力，而且有利于卫生。过去，由于个体经济的条件限制，人们不得不把肥料积在家里、街上、村旁，加上保管又不尽合理，一到夏天，很容易孳生蝇蛆、传染疾病。公社化以后，条件变了，公社不仅完全有力量改变这种情况，改善环境卫生，而且也完全可以按照发展生产的计划，根据各个管理区、生产队的具体情况，统一安排在什么地方修建猪圈、牛栏，什么地方建土化肥厂，什么地方挖沤肥池、坑，什么地方可以修建厕所等等，实行就地取材、就地积肥、造肥、就地施用。当然，要在田头、地边修建猪圈、厕所，挖沤肥池、沤肥坑等，也需要一部分劳动力，而且，要把猪羊养在野地里，也可能要增加一些饲养管理上的麻烦。但是，这些比起就地积肥、造肥的好处来，仅仅是些小麻烦、小支出，害怕这些小麻烦，舍不得花这一小的支出，就不能在合理使用劳动力的总账上获得更大成效。
