Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 29th: In the past year, 350,000 Hong Kong compatriots visited the mainland for sightseeing and family visits. Those who experienced the mainland firsthand have improved their understanding of the socialist motherland and were encouraged by the Great Leap Forward. The visitors included workers, farmers, industrialists and businessmen, educators, women, film, news, publishing, and cultural and artistic workers, people from the financial and sports sectors, medical personnel, employees of various industries, and people from various social groups. Some visited the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, some participated in the Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou, and many visited people's communes in the countryside. Some spent more than forty days traveling through a dozen provinces, while others made day trips to Shenzhen, which borders Kowloon.

The scope of their visits was very broad, including factories, steel bases, people's communes, reservoirs, hydroelectric power stations, cultural, educational and health undertakings, canteens, homes for the elderly, nurseries, and so on. Many people said excitedly after the visit: The lives of the people in the motherland have been fundamentally improved, and a happier and more fulfilling future is in sight.

According to visitors, some people initially did not dare to believe the various miracles that appeared in the Great Leap Forward in the motherland, especially the people's communes. Many people had the mentality of "going back to see what it is really like." However, after the visit, they not only dispelled their doubts, but also greatly improved their understanding. Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. What educated and impressed them the most was that the problems of people's birth, old age, sickness, and death were solved throughout the country, women's labor force was completely liberated, and a noble communist morality and soaring enthusiasm were formed among the people of the country. All the compatriots who had visited the mainland further realized that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government were truly working for the people everywhere, and recognized the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. They felt extremely honored and proud to be Chinese. Their introductions after returning to Hong Kong allowed more Hong Kong compatriots to understand the situation of the motherland.

    百闻不如一见
    香港同胞回内地观光大受鼓舞
    新华社香港29日电　香港同胞在去年一年内有三十五万人次先后回到内地参观、探亲，到过内地身历其境的人，都提高了对社会主义祖国的认识，受到了大跃进的鼓舞。到内地观光的人中，包括工人、农民、工商业者、教育工作者、妇女、电影、新闻、出版、文化艺术工作者，金融、体育界人士，医务人员、各业职工和各业社团人士。他们有的参观了祖国大跃进的情况，有的参加了在广州市举行的出口商品交易会，有不少人下乡参观了人民公社。有的人用了四十多天的时间走了十几个省，也有的人当天来回，观光了同九龙交界的深圳。
    他们参观的范围很广泛，有工厂、钢铁基地、人民公社、水库、水电站、文教卫生事业、食堂、敬老院、托儿所等等方面，许多人在参观后兴奋地说：祖国人民生活从根本上改善了，更幸福美满的前景就在眼前。
    据参观者反映，开始有些人对祖国大跃进中出现的各项奇迹是不敢相信的，特别对人民公社，许多人都抱着“回去看看到底怎样”的心理。但在参观后不仅消除了疑问，而且大大提高了认识。百闻不如一见，给他们教育和感受最深的是全国人民的生养病老问题得到了解决，妇女劳动力得到了彻底解放，全国人民中形成了崇高的共产主义道德风尚和冲天的干劲。所有回内地参观过的同胞，都进一步认识到中国共产党和人民政府真是处处为着人民，认识到社会主义制度的无比优越性，他们为自己是一个中国人而感到无比的光荣和骄傲。他们回到香港后的介绍，使更多香港同胞了解祖国的情况。
