Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 19th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) announced at a press conference held on the 18th, the "Resolution on the Japanese Communist Party's Attitude towards the Neutralization of Japan," passed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Japanese Communist Party held on January 11th.

    The resolution stated that the governments of China and the Soviet Union have separately issued statements expressing their hope for the neutralization of Japan and indicating their respect for Japan's neutral position. This is entirely in line with the Japanese people's desire for peace, independence, and democracy, and with the interests of the nation. The Japanese Communist Party has issued a statement expressing its heartfelt welcome and support for this. The resolution pointed out that despite the slanders of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet against the statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments, more and more Japanese people are realizing the significant meaning of these two statements.

    The resolution pointed out that currently, there are two completely different policies towards Japan internationally: One is the United States' attempt to force Japan to conclude an aggressive military alliance with it by taking the opportunity to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," in order to undermine peace in the Far East, permanently deprive Japan of its independence, and threaten Japan's security. In contrast, China and the Soviet Union, in order to safeguard peace in the Far East, have expressed their respect for Japan's independence, guaranteeing Japan's security, and supporting the neutralization of Japan.

    When discussing the current international situation, the resolution pointed out that under the increasingly apparent condition that the strength of the socialist camp exceeds that of the imperialist camp, the United States' war provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait have been defeated. In order to remedy its political isolation and strategic disadvantage in the Far East, the United States is attempting to transform the current Japan-U.S. relationship into an aggressive Asian military alliance targeting China and the Soviet Union by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," in order to maintain its system of oppression over the Japanese nation, encourage the revival of Japanese militarism, and turn Japan's "Self-Defense Forces" into an aggressive army serving it.

    The resolution pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, in order to realize the ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capital group, is willing to act as the United States' gendarme in the Far East, thereby openly pursuing a policy of reviving militarism to relive the imperialist dream of aggression against Asian countries.

    The resolution pointed out that the situation caused by the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has put Japan at a crucial juncture in determining its fate.

    The resolution pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" launched in the autumn of last year not only forced the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" to become almost a dead letter, but also forced the United States and the Kishi Nobusuke government to be unable to revise the "Security Treaty" according to the original plan, thereby plunging the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet into crisis.

    The resolution pointed out that in the current situation, the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" sharply reminds the Japanese people that this issue is an important question relating to war or peace, and whether to subordinate Japan to the United States or to achieve complete independence, thereby determining the future direction of the country.

    The resolution said that more and more Japanese people have expressed dissatisfaction and unease with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policies, and this dissatisfaction and unease has gradually turned into a demand to change the path Japan is currently taking. The Japanese Communist Party believes that the time has come for the Japanese people to seize the initiative in choosing the future path of the country. Therefore, the Japanese people must fight to transform Japan's policy of subordinating itself to the United States into an independent and neutral policy.

    The resolution then clarified the Japanese Communist Party's position and attitude on the issue of Japan's neutralization. The resolution pointed out that the so-called neutral policy is to break away from all military alliances, not participate in any military alliances, and at the same time establish equal and friendly relations with all countries in the world. The resolution said that after Japan strives to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and promotes the withdrawal of U.S. troops and U.S. military bases from Japan, it will be able to establish a completely equal relationship with the United States as an independent country, and on the basis of not participating in any military alliances, further establish friendly and amicable relations with all countries with different social systems.

    The resolution pointed out that today, with the Chinese and Soviet governments' statements supporting the neutralization of Japan, if the Japanese people stand up to fight for Japan to adopt an independent and neutral policy, they will surely be able to promote Japan to become an independent Asian country pursuing a peaceful policy. The Japanese people have enough strength to achieve this goal.

    The resolution pointed out that a policy of peace and neutrality is a policy that all people of different classes, engaged in different occupations, and holding different political positions, except for a small handful of anti-national and anti-people forces, can unanimously support.

    The resolution said that in order to take this path, the Japanese people must do their utmost to fight to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and strive for the abolition of this treaty.

    The resolution pointed out that the Japanese people must strive to achieve the following goals: 1. Prohibit nuclear armament of Japan; promote the withdrawal of U.S. troops and U.S. military bases from all Japanese territory, including Okinawa and Ogasawara; recover Okinawa and Ogasawara. 2. Restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China; conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; restore normal diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and support the peaceful reunification of Korea; restore diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and promote the implementation of the Geneva Accords; establish amicable and friendly relations with all countries, and develop economic and cultural exchanges. 3. Prevent the revision of the Constitution, uphold the current Constitution, and fully implement the clauses in the Constitution relating to the realization of peace and democracy.

    The resolution said that if the Japanese people achieve victory in the above-mentioned struggle, then they will be able to achieve complete independence and establish a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan. This is not only a guarantee of Japan's security and independence, but will also help maintain peace in Asia and the world. The people of China and the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people of Asian countries who have suffered the heavy disasters of Japanese imperialist aggression, are sincerely hoping for the emergence of a Japan that implements such a policy.

    The resolution concluded by pointing out that as long as the Japanese Communist Party holds high the banner of peace and neutrality, and unites with all the people who can cooperate with it, the Japanese people's movement to strive for peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards will surely achieve rapid development, and the foundation for establishing a national democratic united front in Japan will also be increasingly consolidated. The resolution called on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to fight towards the above-mentioned goals, and to establish a broader united front of the Japanese people.

    日共通过关于日本中立化问题的决议
    日本广大人民要求走和平中立道路
    争取废除日美“安全条约”是决定日本未来方向的重要问题
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会在18日举行的记者招待会上，公布了在1月11日举行的日本共产党四中全会上通过的关于日本共产党对日本中立化的态度的决议。
    决议说，中苏两国政府曾经分别发表声明，表示希望日本中立化，并且表示将尊重日本中立化的立场，这是完全符合日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的愿望和国家利益的，日本共产党已经就此发表声明，表示衷心欢迎和支持。决议指出，尽管岸信介内阁对中苏两国政府的声明进行诬蔑，但是，越来越多的日本人民了解到这两项声明的重要意义。
    决议指出，目前，国际间存在两种完全不同的对日政策：一种是美国利用修改日美“安全条约”的机会，企图迫使日本同它缔结侵略性军事同盟，以破坏远东和平，永久剥夺日本的独立和使日本的安全遭受威胁的政策；与此相反，中苏两国为了维护远东和平，则表示它们尊重日本的独立，保障日本的安全，并且支持日本的中立化。
    决议在谈到目前的国际形势时指出，在社会主义阵营的力量超过帝国主义阵营的形势日益明显的条件下，美国在台湾海峡对中国进行的战争挑衅遭到了失败。美国为了补救它在远东的政治上的孤立和战略上的劣势，企图通过修改日美“安全条约”来把目前的日美关系发展成为针对中苏两国的侵略性的亚洲军事同盟，以维持它对日本民族的压迫体系，并且鼓励日本复活军国主义，把日本的“自卫队”变成为它服务的侵略军队。
    决议指出，岸信介内阁为了实现日本垄断资本集团的野心，甘愿充当美国在远东的宪兵，从而公然推行复活军国主义的政策，来重温侵略亚洲各国的帝国主义旧梦。
    决议指出，由于缔结日美“安全条约”所引起的局势，使日本目前已经面临决定日本命运的重要关
  头。
    决议指出，日本人民在去年秋季展开的反对修改“警职法”的斗争不仅迫使“警职法修正案”几乎成为废案，并且迫使美国和岸信介政府不能按照原订计划来修改“安全条约”，从而使岸信介内阁陷入危机。
    决议指出，在目前的形势下，关于修改日美“安全条约”的问题尖锐地提醒日本人民：这个问题是关系到战争或者和平、使日本从属于美国或者取得完全独立的决定国家将来的方向的重要问题。
    决议说，越来越多的日本人民对岸信介内阁的政策表示了不满和不安，这种不满和不安已经逐渐变成改变日本目前所走的道路的要求。日本共产党相信，日本人民把选择国家将来要走的道路的主动权掌握在自己手里的时机已经到来。因此，日本人民必须为把日本从属于美国的政策转变为自主、中立的政策而斗争。
    决议接着阐明了日本共产党在日本中立化问题上所采取的立场和态度。决议指出，所谓中立政策就是摆脱一切军事同盟、不参加任何军事同盟，同时同世界各国建立平等、友好关系的政策。决议说，日本在争取废除日美“安全条约”、促使美军和美军基地撤出日本之后，将可以以独立国家的资格同美国建立完全平等的关系，并且在不参加任何军事同盟的基础上，进而和不同社会制度的一切国家建立友好、亲善关系。
    决议指出，在中苏两国政府声明支持日本中立化的今天，如果日本人民站起来为使日本采取自主、中立政策而进行斗争，一定能够促使日本成为实行和平政策的亚洲独立国家。日本人民有足够力量来实现这个目标。
    决议指出，和平、中立政策是除了一小撮反民族、反人民的势力以外属于不同阶层、从事不同职业和持有不同政治立场的所有人民都能够一致支持的政策。
    决议说，为了走这条道路，日本人民必须全力为阻止修改日美“安全条约”和争取废除这项条约而斗争。
    决议指出日本人民必须为实现下列目标而奋斗：一、禁止核武装日本；促使美军和美军基地撤出包括冲绳、小笠原在内的日本全部领土；收复冲绳和小笠原。二、恢复日中邦交；缔结日苏和约；恢复同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的正常邦交，支持朝鲜的和平统一；恢复同越南民主共和国的邦交，促使实施日内瓦协议；同一切国家建立亲善、友好关系，发展经济、文化交流。三、阻止改坏宪法，维护现行宪法，完全实施宪法中有关实现和平和民主的条款。
    决议说，如果日本人民在上述斗争中取得胜利，那么就能够实现完全独立，建立和平、独立、民主、中立的日本，这不仅是对日本的安全和独立的保障，而且将有助于维护亚洲和世界和平。中苏两国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的人民，尤其是曾经遭受日本帝国主义侵略的惨重灾难的亚洲各国人民，正在衷心希望出现一个执行这种政策的日本。
    决议最后指出，只要日本共产党高举和平、中立的旗帜，同一切能够同它进行合作的人民团结起来，日本人民争取和平、独立、民主和提高生活水平的运动必将得到飞跃发展，在日本建立民族民主统一战线的基础也将日益巩固。决议号召日本共产党的全体党员朝着上述目标，为建立更加广泛的日本人民的统一战线而斗争。
