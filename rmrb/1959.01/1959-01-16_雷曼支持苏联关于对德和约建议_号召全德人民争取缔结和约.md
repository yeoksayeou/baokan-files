    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 15th: Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, said in a radio address on January 14th on the German peace treaty issue: "All peace-loving people in West Germany who are seeking peace, understanding, and a peaceful resolution to the German question will find in the Soviet draft peace treaty an answer that is in accordance with the national interests of our country."

    Lehmann continued: Such a treaty would be beneficial to all peace-loving people. It will help our people stop German militarism and knock the atomic weapons out of its hands, to guarantee peace and enable them to build a comfortable life.

    Lehmann emphasized: "Adenauer refuses any discussion of the Soviet's new initiative and even prohibits members of his own party from talking about the treaty. He wants to prevent any other suggestions from being made and refuses any kind of negotiation. These facts can only have one explanation: Adenauer wants war." Lehmann said that this is the reason why Adenauer and the German militarists do not accept the Soviet's new initiative. He said: "The government of the Federal Republic of Germany is trying to undermine the proposal to conclude a treaty, while the German Democratic Republic has once again proven that it represents the national and peaceful interests of all the German people."

    Lehmann finally pointed out that the interests of the working class and the entire German nation require us to unite in the struggle against Adenauer's policies and to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: Berlin News: Many political activists in West Germany and West Berlin have made positive evaluations of the Soviet's new proposal to conclude a German peace treaty.

    Elfes, chairman of the West German "German League," emphasized that in the face of the Soviet proposal, the West must finally abandon "past illusions," and in particular, should face the reality of two Germanys. He advocated making good use of the opportunities provided by the Soviet proposal, which could promote the gradual approach and eventual unification of the two Germanys.

    Thomas Dehler, former chairman of the West German Free Democratic Party, pointed out in an interview with the "Berliner Tageblatt" that the new Soviet proposal refers to the restoration of German unity as the right of the German people.

    雷曼支持苏联关于对德和约建议
    号召全德人民争取缔结和约
    新华社柏林15日电　德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼14日就对德和约问题发表广播讲话说：“西德的所有正在寻求和平、谅解与和平解决德国问题的爱好和平的人们将在苏联提出的对德和约草案中找到一个符合我国民族利益的解答。”
    雷曼接着说：这样一个和约将会对所有爱好和平的人都有好处。它将帮助我国人民制止德国军国主义和打掉它手中的原子武器，以保证和平和使他们能够建设舒适的生活。
    雷曼强调说：“阿登纳对苏联的新倡议拒绝进行任何讨论，甚至禁止他自己的政党的党员们谈论和约。他想要阻止任何其他建议的提出，并且拒绝任何一种谈判，这些事实只能有一种解释：阿登纳想要战争。”雷曼说，这就是阿登纳和德国军国主义者不接受苏联新倡议的原因。他说：“德意志联邦共和国政府正试图破坏缔结和约的建议，而德意志民主共和国则再一次证明它是全体德国人民的民族利益与和平利益的代表者。”
    雷曼最后指出，工人阶级和全德意志民族的利益要求我们一致进行反对阿登纳政策的斗争和争取缔结和约。
    据新华社15日讯　柏林消息：西德和西柏林的不少政治活动家对苏联关于缔结对德和约的新建议作出了积极的评价。
    西德“德国人联盟”主席艾尔费斯强调说，在苏联建议面前，西方必须最后地抛弃“过去的幻想”，特别是应该正视两个德国的现实。他主张很好利用苏联建议所提供的能够促使两个德国逐渐接近和最后趋于统一的机会。
    西德自由民主党前主席托马斯·戴勒在对“柏林日报”发表的谈话中指出，在苏联的新建议里把恢复德国统一称作德国人民的权利。
