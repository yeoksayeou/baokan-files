Editorial Postscript:

To ensure high yields and bumper harvests, it is necessary to focus on large areas of high-yield fields, as they are the backbone. However, while grasping the main points, we must not forget the secondary ones; while grasping the large, we must not lose sight of the small; while grasping the near, we must not abandon the far. Therefore, the practice of Liuqiao Commune in Boxing County of organizing labor to strengthen the management of farmland in remote areas is very correct. A great harvest is a comprehensive harvest, which means every plot yields a good harvest and every mu produces high yields. This point must be fully recognized.

    块块兼顾
    保障作物高产丰收，要抓大面积丰产田，因为它是骨干。但是，抓住主要的，不要忘记次要的；抓了大，不要丢了小的；抓了近处的，不要丢了远处的。因此，博兴县柳桥公社组织劳力，对偏僻地区的农田加强管理的做法很对。大丰收，就是全面丰收，就是要块块丰收，亩亩高产。这一点要充分的认识到。
