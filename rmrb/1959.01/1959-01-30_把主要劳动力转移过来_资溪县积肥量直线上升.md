    Transferring Main Labor Force Leads to Sharp Increase in Fertilizer Accumulation in Zixi County

    (Our Dispatch) Zixi County, Jiangxi Province, is simultaneously carrying out fertilizer accumulation by specialized fertilizer teams and scattered fertilizer accumulation by commune members, sparking a county-wide upsurge of "every household mobilized, everyone participating" in fertilizer accumulation.

    Zixi County is a small mountainous county with a lot of land and a small labor force, with each laborer cultivating an average of more than twenty mu of land. According to the situation of having a small labor force, the Zixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China made comprehensive arrangements for fertilizer accumulation after last year's autumn harvest. According to the need to double grain production in 1959 compared to the previous year, the County Committee planned to apply 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of paddy field in 1959, requiring a total of 9 billion jin of fertilizer for the entire county, equivalent to five times that of last year. After the plan was formulated, the entire county adopted the following measures: First, expand the specialized fertilizer accumulation teams. More than 3,000 laborers from winter planting and the iron and steel front were all transferred to the fertilizer accumulation teams, with three-quarters of the county's total labor force dedicated to concentrated fertilizer accumulation. Their tasks are, first, to shovel sod, burn ash fertilizer, and dig field-side cellars, manure pits, and burn Great Leap Forward kilns, ensuring every plot has a cellar and every ridge has a kiln; second, to engage in "three relocations" (turf, stove soil, toilets) to accumulate fertilizer; and third, to vigorously develop indigenous chemical fertilizers, with each production team establishing more than one indigenous chemical fertilizer plant, ensuring every team has a plant. Second, stockmen, cooks, barbers, nursery workers, and working personnel (cadres) carry out "five-member" fertilizer accumulation. Stockmen combine grazing with fertilizer accumulation, cooks collect firewood ash and garbage, barbers collect hair and hair-washing wastewater, nursery workers collect and manage infant and child feces and urine fertilizer; working personnel collect garbage, accumulating twenty dan of fertilizer per person before the Spring Festival. Third, combine fertilizer accumulation with water conservancy construction, road construction, mountain management, and sanitation campaigns. Fourth, carry out technological innovation to improve work efficiency. All communes use vehicles for transporting fertilizer; adopt the method of "three on-site" (obtaining materials on-site, making fertilizer on-site, applying fertilizer on-site) and "three carry" (commune members bring fertilizer to the fields three times a day when going to work) to carry out fertilizer accumulation and application, in order to save labor.

    After the above measures were implemented, everyone participated in fertilizer accumulation, and the fertilizer accumulation movement rapidly developed throughout the county, with the daily amount of fertilizer accumulation increasing sharply and the quality also better than last year.

    把主要劳动力转移过来  资溪县积肥量直线上升
    本报讯　江西省资溪县集肥专业队积肥和社员个人分散积肥一同开展，全县掀起了“户户动员、人人参加”的积肥热潮。
    资溪县是个小山区县，田多劳动力少，平均每个劳动力耕种二十多亩田。中共资溪县委根据劳力少的情况，在去年秋收后，便对积肥作了全面安排。县委按照1959年粮食产量比前一年增长一倍的需要，计划1959年每亩稻田施肥十万斤，全县共要积肥九十亿斤，等于去年的五倍。计划制定之后，全县便采取了如下的措施。一、扩大积肥专业队。把冬种、钢铁战线上的三千多个劳动力全部转到积肥专业队来，以全县总劳动力四分之三的人专搞突击积肥。他们的任务，一个是铲草皮、烧灰肥、挖田头窖、大粪窖、烧跃进窑，做到丘丘有窖，垅垅（山垅）有窑；一个是“三搬家”（地皮、灶土、厕所）积肥；一个是大搞土化肥，每个生产队建立一个以上土化肥厂，做到队队有厂。二、饲养员、炊事员、理发员、保育员、工作员（干部）开展“五员”积肥。饲养员结合放牧积肥，炊事员收集柴火灰、垃圾，理发员收集头发、洗头的污水，保育员收集和管理幼儿粪、尿肥；工作员收集垃圾，到春节前每人积肥二十担。三、结合修水利、修路、修山、卫生运动积肥。四、开展技术革新，提高工效。各公社运肥全部车子化；采取“三就”（就地取材、就地造肥、就地施肥）和“三带”（社员每天三次上工带肥下田）的方法进行积肥和下肥，以节省劳动力。
    上述措施实行之后，人人参加积肥，积肥运动便迅速在全县开展起来了，每日积肥数量直线上升，质量也比去年好。
