The successful launch of cosmic rockets by the Soviet Union marks humanity's entry into a new era of directly exploring the universe. With the beginning of human interstellar travel, geological research will also expand to the moon and even other planets, thereby pushing the past so-called "comparative geology" to a new stage of development, and "astrogeology" will be born accordingly.

"Comparative geology" is based on astronomical observation data of the moon and other planets, and from a geological point of view, it compares the moon and other planets with the Earth. Currently, from the research of "comparative geology," what is known about the moon is: the moon's mass is one-eightieth of the Earth's. The average density is 2.3 times that of water; the average density of the rocks constituting the moon's crust is twice that of water, which is less than that of basalt, granite, and general sedimentary rocks. The atmospheric density surrounding the moon is only one hundred thousandth of the Earth's atmosphere. Two-thirds of the moon's surface are mountains, and one-third are circular plains. The mountainous areas have a large number of ring-shaped mountains and volcanic cones, with peaks reaching up to nine kilometers and deep craters reaching up to four kilometers. The plain areas have many large cracks that are up to one kilometer deep and ten kilometers wide. The entire lunar surface has a thick layer of dust, and volcanic activity is very strong. The temperature on the lunar surface changes drastically, and can go from minus 120 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius in a few minutes, so weathering is very strong. Recently, Soviet scholar Professor Harbakov further drew a structural map of the lunar surface with a scale of 1:1,500,000 based on years of observations of the moon from Earth. He believes that there used to be orogenic movements (the process of rock strata folding into mountains) and epeirogenic movements (large-scale subsidence) on the moon, and these two movements occurred alternately. However, now, except for volcanic eruptions, there is basically no orogenic movement; it can be said that the lunar surface has hardened. The plain and mountainous areas on the moon have different colors. The mountainous areas are mainly red. It is generally believed that the mountains on the moon are mainly formed of iron-rich rocks, so iron ore on the moon may be very abundant; on the other hand, due to frequent magmatic activity, there must be many other metal minerals as well. In addition, according to the study of meteorites, the substances constituting celestial bodies are mainly composed of metals rich in iron, nickel, cobalt, and chromium, and there are also many rare elements among them. According to the results of spectroscopic analysis (different elements show different wavelengths and chromatograms under a spectroscope), the mineral elements on the moon and other planets are also very rich.

However, these inferences are mostly obtained by indirect methods, rather than like the conclusions of geology, which are mainly derived from direct on-the-spot exploration. Even for the moon, which is closest to us, what we can observe is limited to the side facing the Earth. In the near future, with the realization of human travel to the moon, we will be able to use the geological methods of studying the Earth to directly study the moon. Lunar morphology, which is equivalent to geomorphology, lunar tectonics, which is equivalent to geological tectonics, as well as lunar petrology, lunar ore deposit geology, lunar chemistry, and lunar physics, etc., will be gradually established. By analogy, with the realization of human travel to other celestial bodies, "astrogeology," which is equivalent to all branches of geology, will also gradually develop. With the development of astrogeology, we will be able to further understand the morphological structure and material composition of the moon and other planets, and further understand the origin and development history of celestial bodies. This will not only enrich our theoretical knowledge, but also help us to carry out prospecting work on celestial bodies. For example, heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cobalt, and iron, as well as light metals such as lithium, magnesium, aluminum, and titanium, are all present in large quantities in celestial bodies and interstellar matter, which can supplement the mineral resources lacking on Earth. Moreover, we will be able to discover elements that do not exist on Earth. This will make rare elements, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, and non-metallic minerals inexhaustible and inexhaustible, and will make human life more and more fulfilling.

    即将诞生的天体地质学
    中国科学院地质研究所副所长  张文佑
    苏联发射宇宙火箭的成功标志着人类进入直接探索宇宙的新时代。随着人类星际旅行的开始，地质学的研究也将扩展到月球以至其他星球上去，从而把过去所谓“比较地质学”推向新的发展阶段，“天体地质学”将随之诞生了。
    “比较地质学”是根据对于月球和其他星球的天文观测资料，从地质学观点出发，对月球和其他星球与地球作相比较的研究。目前从“比较地质学”的研究对月球所了解到的情况是：月球质量等于地球的八十分之一。平均密度为水的二点三倍；构成月球外壳的岩石的平均密度两倍于水，小于玄武岩、花岗岩和一般沉积岩。包围月球的大气密度只有地球大气的十万分之一。月球表面三分之二是山，三分之一是圆形平原。山区有大量的环状山脉和火山锥，高峰可达九公里，深的火山口可达四公里。平原区有许多深达一公里和宽达十公里的大裂缝。全月球表面有很厚的尘埃层，火山活动很强烈。月球表面温度变化剧烈，在几分钟内可由摄氏零下一百二十度达到摄氏一百五十度，所以风化作用很强。最近苏联学者哈尔巴科教授根据多年来自地球上对于月球的观测，进一步绘制出比例尺为一百五十万分之一的月球表面构造图。他认为过去在月球上曾有过造山运动（岩层折皱成山的作用）和造海运动（大面积沉陷作用），这两种运动是交替发生的。但是，现在除尚有火山喷发活动外，基本上已经没有造山运动；可以说月球表面已经硬化了。月球上的平原区和山区颜色不同，山区主要为红色，一般认为月球上的山脉主要是由富含铁质的岩石形成的，所以月球上的铁矿可能非常丰富；另一方面由于岩浆活动频繁，其他金属矿产也一定是很多的。此外，根据磒石的研究，构成天体的物质以富含铁、镍、钴和铬等金属为主，而且其中还有多种稀有元素。根据光谱分析（不同的元素在分光镜下显示不同的波长和色谱）观测的结果，月球和其他星球上的矿产元素也是非常丰富的。
    但是，这些推论多是用间接方法求得的，而不是像地质学的结论，主要是由直接实地探测而来的。即使对于离我们最近的月球，我们所能观测的也只限于向地球的一面。不久将来、随着人类到月球旅行的实现，我们就将可以把研究地球的地质学方法用来直接研究月球。和地貌学相当的月貌学、和地质构造学相当的月球构造学，以及月球岩石学、月球矿床学、月球化学和月球物理学等等，都将逐步建立。依此类推，随着人类到其他天体旅行的实现，相当于地质学各门的“天体地质学”也将逐步发展起来。随着天体地质学的发展，我们将可以进一步了解月球和其他星球的形态结构和物质成分，进一步了解天体的起源和发展历史。这将不仅可以丰富我们的理论知识，还可以帮助我们在天体上进行找矿工作。如铬、镍、钴和铁等重金属，以及锂、镁、铝和钛等轻金属，都是大量地存在于天体和星际物质中的，将可以补充地球上所缺少的矿产资源。并且，我们将可以发现地球上所没有的元素。这就将使稀有元素、有色金属、黑色金属和非金属矿产都达到取之不尽、用之不绝的地步，将使人类生活越发美满起来。
