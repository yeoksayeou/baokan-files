Editor's Note:

    With Creation, Promote It
    Various regions have created many advanced tools and excellent methods in the manure accumulation campaign. This is the prelude to a technical revolution in manure accumulation.

    Once the successfully tested manure accumulation and transportation tools and advanced methods are affirmed, they should be immediately organized for promotion. The Anbu People's Commune in Chao'an County, Guangdong, has done a good job in this regard. They held on-site meetings, and through observation and debate, they promoted more than 1,000 high-efficiency tools in ten days. Haicheng County in Fujian Province also paid attention to promotion work, and as a result, the manure accumulation campaign in the county developed rapidly.

    With creation, promote it, which means turning the good experiences of one place into the wealth of all places; once good experiences are promoted, they will inevitably become richer, because the process of promotion is also the process of development.

    有了创造，就要推广
    各地在积肥运动中，创造了很多先进工具和良好的方法。这是积肥技术革命的先声。
    试验成功的积肥、运肥工具和先进方法，一经肯定，应该立即组织推广。这一点，广东潮安县庵埠人民公社做得很好，他们召开现场会议，通过边参观、边辩论，在十天中推广了一千多件高工效工具；福建海澄县也重视了推广工作，因而全县积肥运动迅速开展起来。
    有了创造，就要推广，就是说要把一个地方的好经验变成各个地方的财富；好经验一经推广，也必然会更加丰富起来，因为推广的过程也正是发展的过程。
