Comrade Xiao Jia:

    In your letter, you discussed some issues related to adapting the novel "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" into a play, and you also provided valuable opinions on the play "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" that Comrade Gao Chen and I co-adapted. I am very grateful and would like to share my views on the issues you raised.

    Bringing "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" to the stage can educate the audience on patriotism and provide revolutionary historical education. Through the performance of "Bitter Vegetable Flowers," the audience can understand how the Party led the people in a tenacious struggle against Japanese imperialism to save the nation from peril, and ultimately defeated the enemy. They can understand that the seemingly strong imperialism is just a paper tiger, and that victory will ultimately belong to the people. They can recognize that without the arduous struggles and sacrifices of the past, there would be no freedom and happiness today. This will encourage us today not to forget the past, to love today even more, and to love the Party even more.

    However, the adaptation of "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" has many shortcomings, as you mentioned: it lacks focus, and the theme and story are not concentrated enough. Therefore, I would also like to share some very superficial experiences from adapting "Bitter Vegetable Flowers":

    A drama must have a story, characters, and conflicts, otherwise, it is not a play. If we were to write about the mother's growth as in the novel, it would be difficult to structure a play, and it would also be beyond our writing abilities. So, I first focused on the anti-espionage struggle. However, even focusing on the anti-espionage line, I still encountered difficulties in terms of structure, i.e., it was difficult to string together a complete story based on the material in the novel. What to do? We adopted another approach, which was to not stray too far from the novel, but to make some additions and deletions. The result of this structure is what is being performed on stage today. The advantage is that the performance effect is still good, but the disadvantage is that it lacks focus, and the theme and story are not concentrated enough. How to improve it? Small changes are possible, but large changes are difficult to find a way to make, and we are in a state of "helplessness." If we dare to think and act, then we would have to greatly break through the constraints of the original novel and give more fiction to make it more complete, otherwise, it is difficult to solve. But if we boldly fictionalize, it will inevitably form another situation, that is, it will deviate too far from the novel, even become unrecognizable, and it will be like starting from scratch, which would no longer be an adaptation.

    So, how should we adapt a novel? After thinking about it, I think there are three ways: First, if the novel itself has the conditions for being adapted into a play, or if a part of it can be adapted, then we should concentrate on the essence according to the theme of the novel and make some creations and supplements to bring it to the stage. This will make the drama unified and complete while conforming to the spirit of the original novel. This adaptation method is of course the best and most successful adaptation. Second, if we encounter a novel like "Bitter Vegetable Flowers," where the story, plot, and characters are not concentrated enough and it is difficult to structure a unified and complete play, what should we do? My idea is to be bolder, get rid of the shackles of the novel, and take a certain point or several points as material to process and use, and then give more fiction and more creation based on our own lives and ideals. I think this approach may also produce a good play. What's wrong with writing a good play using this method? The third is to change the difficult-to-concentrate novel into a new continuous play. However, this method of adaptation is not very ideal.

    Personally, I am more affirmative of the first two methods. I don't know if my views are correct?

    In addition, I believe that creation and adaptation have equally important significance, and it is also a matter of walking on two legs. Adapting novels into dramas is a very good tradition in Chinese opera. Many traditional operas come from novels, but they have unique characteristics. Today, we are exploring how to adapt novels and summarizing some experiences in this area through practice, which is beneficial to the development of the drama movement.

    从改编中感到的问题
    薛恩厚萧甲同志：
    你来信谈了把小说“苦菜花”改编成戏的一些问题，同时，也对我和高琛同志合作改编的“苦菜花”一剧提出宝贵意见，甚为感激，愿就你所提的问题谈谈我的看法。
    “苦菜花”搬上舞台可以使观众受到爱国主义教育，也是革命历史教育；通过“苦菜花”的演出，使观众认识到党为了挽救民族危亡，如何领导人民同日本帝国主义进行顽强的斗争，并最后战胜了敌人；理解到外强中干的帝国主义不过是只纸老虎，胜利一定会属于人民；认识到没有过去的艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲，就没有今天的自由、幸福。从而使我们今天的人不要忘记过去，更加要热爱今天，更加热爱党。
    但是，“苦菜花”的改编有很多缺点，正如你所谈的：失之于松散，主题、故事不够集中。因而，我也谈谈改编“苦菜花”当中一点非常肤浅的体会：
    戏剧要写故事、人物、冲突，否则不成为一个戏。如果按照小说那样写母亲的成长，是很难结构成一个戏的，也是我们写作水平所不能胜任的。于是我就先抓反特斗争这条线，但抓反特这条线，在结构上依然碰到困难，即按小说的材料很难串起一个完整的故事。怎么办呢？我们就采取了另一个办法，即不敢离小说太远，又有所增删，结构的结果就是今天舞台上演的这个样子。其优点是演出效果还好，缺点是失之松散，主题、故事不够集中。如何改进呢？小的改动还可以，大的改动尚无门路可寻，处于“无可奈何”的状态中。如果敢想敢作的话，那就得大大突破原有小说的束缚，给予更多的虚构，才有可能趋于完整，否则是很难解决的。但如果大胆虚构，必然会形成另一种情况，即脱离小说太远，甚至于面貌全非，等于另起炉灶，那就不成其为改编了。
    那末，对改编小说究竟怎样作为好呢？想来想去，认为办法有三：第一种，如果小说本身就具备改编成戏的条件，或局部可改编成戏，那就根据小说主题，集中精华并进行若干创作、补充，搬上舞台。作到既合乎原小说的精神又使戏剧统一完整。这种改编办法当然是最上乘、最成功的改编了。第二种，如遇像“苦菜花”这样小说，故事、情节、人物本来就不够集中、很难结构成一个统一完整的戏，怎么办呢？我的想法，干脆大胆一些，摆脱小说的束缚，取其某点或若干点作为素材来处理和运用，然后根据自己的生活和理想给以更多的虚构和更多的创作，我认为这种作法也可能写出好戏来。用这种方法写成一个好戏有什么不好呢？第三种是把难以集中的小说改为新连台本戏。但，这种改法又不是很理想的办法。
    我个人是比较肯定前两种办法的。不知道我的见解对不对？
    此外，我认为创作与改编都有同等重要的意义，也是两条腿走路的问题。把小说改成戏剧是我国戏曲中一个很好的传统，传统戏中很多都是来源于小说，而又独具特色。今天我们探讨一下如何改编小说，并通过实践总结这方面的一些经验，对戏剧运动的开展是有好处的。
