Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic

Respected Comrade Premier, Respected Comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Comrades, Friends:

Today, we feel particularly cordial and happy to be able to welcome once again the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Otto Grotewohl, to visit our country in our capital. First of all, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests, respected Comrade Premier Otto Grotewohl and all the comrades of the delegation. Everyone remembers that three years ago, Premier Grotewohl led the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic on a friendly visit to our country and signed the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with our government, making a great contribution to the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and German peoples. Today, we would like to especially thank them for bringing once again the profound friendship of the German people towards the Chinese people.

Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved great victories in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. They have already laid the foundation for the grand edifice of building a socialist society. The Chinese people are elated and encouraged by the significant achievements they have made.

Standing on the western frontier of the socialist camp, the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace. Its international ties are constantly expanding and strengthening, and its international status is also rising day by day. The German Democratic Republic resolutely opposes the war and aggression policies of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States, opposes the revival of West German militarism, and has made unremitting efforts to safeguard peace in Europe and the world. In order to strive for Germany to become a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country, the German Democratic Republic has put forward many reasonable proposals, such as the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a confederation by the two Germanys. Not long ago, the Soviet government proposed the withdrawal of foreign troops from Berlin, the ending of the occupation status of West Berlin, and the transformation of West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. Recently, the Soviet government also put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany and suggested that relevant countries convene a meeting to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. The Chinese people, like the people of the German Democratic Republic, warmly support and firmly endorse these positive proposals. It is very clear that turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city will greatly help promote the rapprochement between the two Germanys and the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, thereby facilitating the reunification of Germany and peace in Europe. Today, fourteen years after the war, the Western countries headed by the United States have no reason to reject these reasonable proposals. If they continue to linger in West Berlin and intensify their efforts to turn West Germany and West Berlin into military bases for aggression against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, then things will develop in the opposite direction to what they expect, and their war and aggression policies will suffer an even more disgraceful defeat in the face of the growing opposition of all peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people are deeply convinced that the great German people's sacred cause of reunifying their motherland will surely achieve final victory, because the power of truth and justice cannot be stopped by any reactionary force.

Comrades, Friends! Since Comrade Premier Grotewohl's last visit to our country, the international situation has undergone tremendous changes in a short period of three years. The East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown unprecedentedly. The Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year construction plan and the successful launch of cosmic rockets have once again powerfully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and against colonial oppression have become an irresistible torrent. The Cuban people's overthrow of the US-backed dictatorial regime and the Congolese people's roar against colonialism are signs that this struggle will continue to flourish in the new year. The struggle of people all over the world to maintain peace and oppose war is also rising day by day. The situation in the imperialist camp is characterized by the severity of the economic crisis, the intensification of social conflicts, and the sharpening of internal contradictions. Desertion and division are the inevitable laws of their development. No matter what means the imperialist ruling cliques and their various lackeys use to obstruct and undermine the cause of peace and progress for the people of the world, they cannot change their destiny of being doomed to failure.

Dear Comrade Premier, the Chinese people are pleased to see that the fraternal friendship between our two peoples has been fully developed on the basis of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. In the struggle for socialist construction and the maintenance of world peace, we support each other and help each other. I would like to emphasize that in our socialist construction and the struggle against imperialism, the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic have given the Chinese people sincere support and assistance. Today, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to unite with the people of the German Democratic Republic forever and forge ahead for our common cause.

Comrades, Friends, I propose a toast,

To the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples,
To the growing prosperity and strength of the German Democratic Republic,
To the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
To world peace,
To the health of Premier Grotewohl and all the comrades of the delegation,
To the health of President Wilhelm Pieck, a respected friend of the Chinese people and a beloved leader of the German people.

Cheers!

### 在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团的宴会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们能够在我国的首都再一次欢迎以奥托·格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团来我国访问，感到特别亲切和高兴。首先，我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向我们的贵宾、敬爱的奥托·格罗提渥总理同志和代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎。大家都还记得，三年以前，格罗提渥总理曾经率领德意志民主共和国政府代表团到我国进行友好访问，并且同我国政府签订了中德友好合作条约，对中德两国人民友好关系的发展做出了巨大的贡献。今天，我们要特别感谢他们又一次带来了德意志人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。
    兄弟的德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中，获得了巨大的胜利。他们已经为建筑社会主义社会的宏伟大厦奠定了基础。中国人民为他们所取得的重大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    德意志民主共和国站在社会主义阵营的西方前线，一贯执行和平的对外政策。它的国际联系正在不断扩大和加强，它的国际地位也在日益提高。德意志民主共和国坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团的战争政策和侵略政策，反对西德军国主义复活，并且为维护欧洲和世界的和平进行了不懈的努力。为了争取德意志成为一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的国家，德意志民主共和国曾经提出缔结对德和约以及由两个德国建立邦联等许多合理的建议。不久以前，苏联政府提出关于从柏林撤退外国军队、结束西柏林的占领状态和把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议。最近，苏联政府又提出对德和约草案，并且建议有关国家召开会议讨论和签订对德和约。中国人民和德意志民主共和国人民一样，热烈拥护和坚决支持这些积极的建议。事实很明显，把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市，将大大有助于促进两个德国的接近和对德和约的签订，从而有利于德国的重新统一和欧洲的和平。在战后十四年的今天，以美国为首的西方国家没有任何理由拒绝这些合理的建议。如果它们继续赖在西柏林不走，并且变本加厉地把西德和西柏林变成侵略德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的军事基地，那么，事情就会朝着它们所设想的反面发展，它们的战争政策和侵略政策在全世界一切爱好和平的人民日益增长的反对下就会遭到更可耻的失败。中国人民深信，伟大的德意志人民统一祖国的神圣事业一定会取得最后的胜利，因为，真理和正义的力量是任何反动势力都阻挡不了的。
    同志们，朋友们！自从格罗提渥总理同志上次访问我国以来，在短短的三年时间中，国际形势发生了十分巨大的变化，东风已经压倒西风，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前壮大了。苏联的宏伟的七年建设计划和宇宙火箭的成功发射，再一次有力地显示出社会主义制度的无比优越性。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立、反对殖民压迫的斗争已经成为一股不可抗拒的洪流。古巴人民推翻美国所豢养的独裁政权，刚果人民发出了反对殖民主义的怒吼，就是这个斗争在新的一年继续蓬勃发展的标志。全世界人民维护和平、反对战争的斗争也一天比一天高涨。帝国主义阵营的情况则是经济危机的严重、社会冲突的加剧和内部矛盾的尖锐化。众叛亲离，四分五裂，这就是它们发展的必然规律。帝国主义统治集团和它们的各式各样的仆从，不管用什么手段来阻挠和破坏全世界人民争取和平和进步的事业，也无法改变他们注定要失败的命运。
    亲爱的总理同志，中国人民高兴地看到，我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊在中德友好合作条约的基础上有了全面的发展。在社会主义建设和维护世界和平的斗争中，我们互相支持，互相帮助。我愿意强调指出，在我国社会主义建设事业和反对帝国主义的斗争中，德意志民主共和国政府和人民给了中国人民以真诚的支持和援助。今天，我愿意在这里代表中国政府和中国人民向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。中国人民决心同德意志民主共和国人民永远团结在一起，为了我们共同的事业而奋勇前进。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议，
    为中德两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，
    为德意志民主共和国的日益繁荣和富强，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为格罗提渥总理和代表团全体同志的健康，
    为中国人民敬爱的朋友、德意志人民敬爱的领袖威廉·皮克总统的健康。
    干杯！
