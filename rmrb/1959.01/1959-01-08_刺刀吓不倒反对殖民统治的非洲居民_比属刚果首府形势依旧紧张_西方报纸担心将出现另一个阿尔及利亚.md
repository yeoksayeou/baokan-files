Xinhua News Agency, 7th. News from Léopoldville states that the situation in Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo in Central Africa, remains very tense. Despite the brutal suppression by the Belgian colonial authorities, African residents continue to resist Belgian colonial rule in various ways.

The African residential areas of this city are still sealed off by Belgian military police today. After the riots of African residents on the 4th and 5th, the Belgian colonial authorities hastily mobilized a large number of troops into the city, including paratroopers and armored units; the paratroopers were even transported by air. However, even Léopoldville Mayor Todl had to admit at a press conference held locally on the afternoon of the 6th that only a few areas of Léopoldville had returned to normal, and that as soon as the Belgian patrols left, African residents continued to hold rebellious demonstrations.

The Belgian authorities are carrying out terroristic large-scale arrests of African residents. Todl also admitted that about 300 people have already been arrested. Among these are Daniel Kanza, chairman of the Congolese political organization "Abako" Association, and other Congolese leaders.

This revolt by the residents of the Belgian Congo against colonial rule has aroused panic among Western colonial countries.

The "New York Times" editorial on the 7th wrote that "the African independence movement, which aims to 'completely liberate' the African continent from colonial rule, has now expanded to the Belgian Congo, which has hitherto been unaffected." The newspaper fears that the Belgian Congo will become "another Algeria" and hopes that Belgium will take action to prevent this. The Belgian Congo is rich in uranium mines, and the United States is a major buyer of uranium from the Belgian Congo. The first American atomic bombs were made with uranium produced in the Belgian Congo.

The Portuguese government authorities have also expressed concern about the situation in the Belgian Congo, fearing that the impact of the Léopoldville riots will spread throughout the Belgian Congo and even to Portuguese Angola, which borders the Belgian Congo.

    刺刀吓不倒反对殖民统治的非洲居民
    比属刚果首府形势依旧紧张
    西方报纸担心将出现另一个阿尔及利亚
    新华社7日讯　据来自利奥波德维尔的消息，中非比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔的形势仍然很紧张。尽管比利时殖民当局残酷地进行了镇压，非洲居民继续用各种方式反抗比利时殖民统治。
    这个城市的非洲居民区今天仍旧被比利时军警封锁着。在4、5两日发生了非洲居民的暴动以后，比利时殖民当局慌忙调集了大批军队开进这个城市，其中包括伞兵和装甲部队，伞兵甚至是空运去的。但是就连利奥波德维尔市长托德尔在6日下午在当地举行的记者招待会上也不得不承认，利奥波德维尔还只有几个地区恢复正常，非洲居民只要一等比利时巡逻队离开，他们就继续举行反抗性示威。
    比利时当局正在对非洲居民进行恐怖性的大逮捕，托德尔也承认已经逮捕了三百人左右。这些人中有刚果人政治组织“阿巴科”协会的主席丹尼尔·坎扎和其他刚果领袖。
    比属刚果居民反抗殖民统治的这次暴动已经引起西方殖民国家的恐慌。
    7日的“纽约时报”的社论写道，“目的在于把非洲大陆从殖民统治中‘完全解放’出来的非洲独立运动，现在已经扩及迄今一直没有受到影响的比属刚果”。这家报纸担心比属刚果将成为“另一个阿尔及利亚”，并且希望比利时采取行动来防止这一点。比属刚果富于铀矿，美国是比属刚果的铀的大买主，美国第一批原子弹就是用比属刚果出产的铀制造的。
    葡萄牙政府当局也对比属刚果的局势表示不安，它害怕利奥波德维尔的暴动的影响会扩大到整个比属刚果，甚至扩大到同比属刚果接壤的葡属安哥拉。
