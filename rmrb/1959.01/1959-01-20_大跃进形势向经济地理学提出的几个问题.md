The nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, have caused a qualitative leap in the political and economic life of our people. This new situation has also raised many significant new issues, including many in the field of economic geography.

        Industrial Configuration and Comprehensive Development of Regional Productive Forces

Due to the implementation of the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, to central and local industries, to large and small enterprises, and to indigenous and foreign methods of production, our industrial production has spread like stars across the country from the interior to the border regions, from cities to rural areas, and from plains to mountains. The distribution of industry has shifted from a distribution of "points" to a distribution across a "surface." Each region has an increasing number of production departments, and the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and waste products allows the production departments to connect with and penetrate each other, strengthening the comprehensive nature of regional productive force development. Not only are large economic cooperation zones and provinces forming huge regional production complexes, but cooperation zones, special districts, counties, and even people's communes within provinces are gradually forming multi-sectoral regional production complexes of varying scales. These regional production complexes are organically linked together to form a vast national economic system. Due to the specific differences in natural conditions and resources, historical economic conditions, and national economic needs in various regions of the country, there are different approaches to realizing the comprehensive development of regional productive forces and implementing the principle of combining large, medium, and small scale operations and indigenous and foreign methods in different scales, and many problems need to be studied.

        Rational Agricultural Configuration and Agricultural Regionalization

Before 1958, most regions of the country needed to concentrate about 80% of their arable land on grain production, and over 80% of the grain was still for rural self-sufficiency. Therefore, the regional division of agricultural production had not yet become a universal requirement. With the basic solution of the grain problem and the guarantee of planting less but harvesting more as a result of the agricultural Great Leap Forward, it is possible to gradually free up some land to develop cash crops, animal husbandry, horticulture, and other previously weak agricultural sectors. The products of these sectors have higher commercial value and stronger regional characteristics. Production in each region cannot be solely for local self-sufficiency but must supply large quantities to other regions. Cotton, sugarcane, tea, silk, rubber, fine wool sheep, etc., cannot be effectively produced to the same extent in every part of the country. Every region must develop a multi-sector economy of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but the multi-sector economy of the Northeast and South China will inevitably be very different. To avoid the unreasonable transportation of agricultural products that may occur in development, and the uniform agricultural production content regardless of specific conditions, the question of how to achieve the rational configuration of agricultural production, namely the regional specialization and comprehensive development of agricultural production, in a planned way throughout the country in accordance with local conditions has become an urgent objective practical problem to be solved. According to the needs of the national economy and natural economic conditions, giving priority to allocating each agricultural sector and crop to the regions with the greatest needs and best conditions, and realizing a rational regional division of agricultural production among various regions of the country, will enable these sectors and crops to develop most rapidly. Within each region, a rational combination of major and minor sectors should be achieved in accordance with local conditions, ensuring both national and local needs and fully exploring the productive potential of each place. To solve these tasks, it is necessary to deeply study the relevant natural economic conditions for agricultural production, fully estimate the national economic needs for various agricultural products, to formulate plans for the agricultural configuration of each sector and region and to carry out agricultural regionalization work at all levels, as a scientific basis for agricultural planning departments to assign tasks and formulate agricultural development plans.

                Rational Utilization of Land

The principle of "planting less, producing more, and harvesting more" formulated under the premise of large-area, high-yield, and bumper harvests requires a gradual reduction of arable land throughout the country, implementing the spirit of the "three-three" system. This has led to the widespread re-configuration of agricultural land. Since high-yield bumper harvests are to be guaranteed, the conditions for arable land must be even stricter. For example, to achieve deep plowing, areas with excessively thin soil layers are obviously not suitable; to achieve high-standard water conservancy and mechanization, steep slopes cannot be used as arable land. However, different regions have different natural conditions and agricultural development contents, and the arable land for different regions and different crops needs to be selected under different conditions, and there cannot be a uniform standard. On the other hand, fallow land cannot adopt the backward "reclaiming wasteland" method. How to utilize fallow land, how to transition to landscaping, and the landscaping of each region should have different contents. The "three-three" system ratio cannot be mechanically applied regardless of mountains, plains, south, or north. If it is said that it was impossible to fully and rationally utilize land under the small-scale peasant economy and backward agricultural production level, then under the conditions of people's communes and agricultural mechanization and electrification, it is possible to most rationally utilize land according to national economic needs and natural conditions, making land an inexhaustible source for developing agriculture. These are all issues worthy of study.

        Agricultural Configuration After Agricultural Industrialization

With the gradual realization of planting less and producing more, and agricultural mechanization and electrification, agricultural industrialization has been placed on the agenda as an important topic. However, agriculture is not exactly like industry; it is the reproduction of plants and animals, and plants and animals are organically linked to the environment. Therefore, different regions should have different forms and contents of agricultural industrialization, unlike industry where the same design drawings can be used everywhere. On the other hand, the result of planting less and producing more and agricultural industrialization may be like the current high-yield satellite fields, with sheds added to large fields, or further turning the sheds into greenhouses and implementing artificial heating, cultivating field crops in greenhouses and hotbeds. The waste heat and waste steam provided by the large-scale industry in rural areas also create conditions for artificial heating. In this way, the growth of crops may, to a large extent, break away from the limitations of zonality and seasonality caused by insufficient heat that could not be overcome until now (insufficient rainfall can now be solved by irrigation and artificial rainfall, but insufficient temperature and excessively short frost-free periods cannot be solved), widely planting subtropical crops in the north, thereby revolutionizing the conditions and appearance of agricultural configuration.

    Rational Utilization of Labor Resources and Rational Configuration of Residential Areas

After the establishment of people's communes, the movement of "engaging in both agriculture and industry" by all-rounders, and the comprehensive combination of "workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers," with the simultaneous development of multi-sectoral economy, will gradually change the old social division of labor, especially gradually eliminate the difference between "industrial population" and "agricultural population." This has created a completely new situation in the utilization of labor resources, the departmental allocation of labor, and the seasonal balance of labor. On the other hand, with the gradual realization of rural industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification, cities and villages will gradually become landscaped, and rural residential areas will be transformed from the scattered and backward state of "small bridges, flowing water, and households" to relatively concentrated new-type residential areas with modern production equipment and modern material and cultural facilities. Cities will not only be consumption bases but also production centers, and will be transformed from noisy and polluted living environments to scenic garden cities. This will gradually narrow and eliminate the existing differences in production and living conditions between urban and rural areas. However, in our large country with such a large population and such a diverse environment, how to achieve the elimination of these differences, how to transform old residential areas, and how to reconfigure new residential areas cannot adopt a uniform format everywhere. These issues are very prominent and worthy of study.

        Strive to Establish a New Economic Geography of Our Country

The above issues share common characteristics: First, they are all major issues that have already emerged and will emerge in the practice of socialist construction in our country, and are also new issues that the Party and the government, together with the broad masses of the people, urgently need to solve and are working to solve. In order to combine the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses with realistic and scientific analysis, and to strive for greater victories, a large amount of scientific research is needed. Scientific workers cannot stand idly by. Second, these issues are closely related to the natural and economic conditions of various regions and have strong regional characteristics. Therefore, geographers, especially economic geographers, can play a role in the study of these issues. Third, most of these issues have Chinese characteristics. Through the study of these issues, it is possible to grasp their unique laws from practice, opening up a new situation for establishing a new economic geography of our country and laying a foundation.

These are all new issues, with no established rules to follow. This requires economic geographers to completely emancipate their minds, break away from the constraints of outdated theoretical principles, and discover and summarize laws from the rich practical experience of the broad masses of the people. For this purpose, it is necessary to shift from the working method of simply describing the status quo to the method of deeply studying problems, from the method of broadly looking at things in a cursory way to the method of detailed research in small areas. Basic units such as people's communes (which involve all the above issues) should be the best base points for conducting research. To solve practical tasks, not only do all geographical workers need to put politics in command, cooperate closely, and work with full vigor, but they also need to humbly learn from related marginal sciences and from the broad masses of the people. We believe that as long as economic geography workers closely rely on the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, deeply study the Party's guidelines and policies and the natural and economic conditions of various regions of our country, as well as the rich experience of the broad masses of the people, they will certainly be able to make contributions to socialist construction and completely change the backward state of economic geography in our country in a short period of time.

    大跃进形势向经济地理学提出的几个问题
    中国科学院地理研究所副研究员  邓静中
    全国工农业大跃进，全国农村实现人民公社化，这种新形势引起我国人民政治经济生活上的质的飞跃，也提出了许多重大的新问题，其中包括许多经济地理学上的问题。
        工业配置和地区生产力综合发展问题
    由于贯彻执行工业和农业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举以及土法生产和洋法生产同时并举的方针，使得我国的工业生产从内地到边疆、从城市到农村、从平原到山地星罗棋布，遍地开花。工业配置从“点”的分布，转向“面”的分布。每一个地区生产部门越来越多，原料废料的综合利用使得各生产部门互相联系互相渗透，地区生产力发展的综合性越来越强。不仅大的经济协作区、省区正在形成为巨大的生产地域综合体，就是省内的协作区、专区、县乃至人民公社，都在逐渐形成为多部门结合的不同规模的生产地域综合体。这些生产地域综合体有机地联系起来，便组成为庞大的全国的经济体系。由于全国各地区的自然条件和资源、历史经济条件以及国民经济需要的具体差别，如何因地制宜地在不同规模上实现地区生产力综合发展和贯彻大中小结合土洋并举的方针，目前在不同地区有不同的作法，也存在着许多需要研究的问题。
        农业合理配置与农业区划问题
    1958年以前全国大部分地区需要集中80％左右的耕地去生产粮食，而80％以上的粮食还是农村的自给性生产，因而农业生产地域分工还没有普遍成为现实的要求。在农业大跃进使粮食问题得到基本解决并保证少种多收的前提下，便可以逐步腾出一部分的土地来发展经济作物、畜牧业、园艺业等等原来比较薄弱的农业部门。这些部门的产品具有较高的商品性和较强的地域性。每个地区的生产不能仅仅为了本地自给，必需大量供应其他地区。棉花、甘蔗、茶叶、蚕丝、橡胶、细毛羊等等也不是全国任何地方都能够同等有效地进行生产的。每个地区都要发展农、林、牧、副、渔的多部门经济，而东北和华南的多部门经济必然大有差别。为了避免发展中可能出现的不合理的农产品调运，以及不顾具体条件的千篇一律的农业生产内容，如何在全国范围内因地制宜地有计划地实现农业生产合理配置即农业生产地域专门化和综合发展的问题，便成了客观实践上迫切需要解决的问题。按照国民经济需要和自然经济条件，把每一个农业部门和作物优先配置在需要最多条件最好的地区，在全国各地区间实现农业生产合理的地域分工，将使得这些部门和作物得到最迅速的发展。而在每一个地区内部又因地制宜地实现主要部门和次要部门的合理结合，既保证全国性需要，也保证地方性需要，充分发掘各地的生产潜力，为了解决这些任务，就需要深入研究有关农业生产的自然经济条件，充分估计国民经济对各种农产品的需要，来拟定各部门各地区农业配置的方案和进行各级的农业区划工作，作为农业计划部门分配任务、制订农业发展规划的科学依据。
                土地的合理利用问题
    在大面积高额丰产前提下所制定的“少种、高产、多收”的方针，要求在全国范围内逐步缩小耕地，贯彻“三三”制的精神，这就普遍出现了农业用地的重新配置问题。既然要保证高额丰产，那么对耕地的条件必然要更加严格。例如，为了要实现深耕，那么土层太薄的地方显然不符合要求，为了要实现高标准的水利化和机械化，那么陡坡显然不能作为耕地。然而，不同地区有不同的自然条件和农业发展的内容，不同地区不同作物的耕地也就需要选择不同的条件，而不可能有千篇一律的标准。另一方面，休耕地也不能采用落后的“撩荒”方式，休耕地如何利用，如何向园林化过渡，各个地区的园林化应该有不同的内容，也不能不管山地平原南方北方都机械地搬用“三三”制的比例。假如说在小农经济和落后的农业生产水平下不可能充分合理利用土地，那么在人民公社化和农业机械化电气化的条件下，便可能按照国民经济需要和自然条件，最合理地利用土地，使土地成为无穷无尽的发展农业的源泉。这些都是值得研究的问题。
        农业工厂化后的农业配置问题
    随着少种高产多收以及农业机械化和电气化的逐步实现，农业工厂化已作为一个重要课题提到日程上来。然而农业究竟不像工业，它是动植物的再生产，而动植物是与环境有机联系着的。因而不同地区应有不同的农业工厂化的形式和内容，不像工业可以各地采用相同的设计图纸。另一方面，少种高产和农业工厂化的结果，有可能像现在某些高产卫星田一样在大田加上篷盖，也有可能进一步把篷盖变成温室并实行人工加温，把大田作物进行温室温床栽培，而农村大办工业所提供的废热废汽也给人工加温创造了条件。这样一来，农作物的生长便可能在很大程度上摆脱迄今不能摆脱的由于热量不足造成的地带性和季节性的限制（现在雨量不足可以用灌溉和人工降水等办法来解决，气温不足和无霜期过短却无办法），把亚热带作物广泛种到北方去，从而使得农业配置的条件和农业配置的面貌发生革命性的变化。
    劳动资源合理利用与居民点合理配置问题
    人民公社化以后实行“亦农亦工”的多面手运动，和“工农商学兵”全面结合，多部门经济齐头并进，这将逐步改变旧有的社会分工特别是使“工业人口”同“农业人口”的差别逐步趋于消失。这在劳动资源的利用、劳动力的部门分配和劳动力季节平衡问题上出现了完全新的局面。另一方面，随着农村工业化、农业机械化电气化的逐步实现，城市和农村逐步走向园林化，农村的居民点将从“小桥流水人家”的分散落后状态，转变为具有现代化的生产装备、现代化的物质文化设施的比较集中的新型居民点。而城市则不仅由消费据点变为生产中心，更将由喧嚣污浊的生活环境转变为风景幽美的花园城。这将使城市与乡村间现存的生产与生活条件的差别逐步缩小而趋于消灭。但在我们这个人口如此众多、环境如此多样化的大国里，如何实现这种差别的消灭，如何改造旧居民点和重新配置新居民点，不可能在各地方都采用千篇一律的格式。这些问题都是很特出的值得研究的问题。
        为建立我国新的经济地理学而奋斗
    以上这些问题，具有共同的特点：一、它们都是我国社会主义建设实践中已经出现和即将出现的重大问题，也是党和政府同广大人民群众迫切需要解决并正在着手解决的新问题。为了使广大群众的冲天干劲同实事求是的科学分析结合起来，为了争取更大的胜利，需要进行大量的科学研究。科学工作者是不能袖手旁观的。二、这些问题都和各地的自然经济条件有密切联系，具有强烈的地域性，因而地理工作者特别是经济地理工作者，有可能在这些问题的研究上发生作用。三、这些问题大多具有中国的特殊性，通过这些问题的研究，可以从实践中掌握其特有的规律。为建立我国新的经济地理学打开局面，奠定基础。
    这些都是新问题，没有任何成规可据。这就需要经济地理工作者彻底解放思想，破除过时的理论原则的约束，从广大人民群众丰富的实践经验中去发现规律、总结出来。为了这个目的，就必需从单纯描述现状的工作方式转向深入钻研问题的方式，从大面积走马看花的方式转向在小地区详细研究的方式，而像人民公社这样一种基层单位（它涉及上述的一切问题）应该是进行研究的最好的基点。为了解决实践任务，不仅需要所有地理工作者政治挂帅、通力协作、鼓足干劲，更需要向有关的边缘科学、向广大群众虚心学习。我们相信，只要经济地理工作者紧紧依靠党的领导，走群众路线，深入钻研党的方针政策和我国各地区的自然经济条件以及广大人民群众的丰富经验，一定能够在社会主义建设中作出贡献，并在短期内彻底改变我国经济地理学的落后面貌。
