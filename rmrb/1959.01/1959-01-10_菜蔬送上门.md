    Vegetables Delivered to the Door

    Old Man Li Shixiang is a member of the Haiyan People's Commune in Ganjingzi District, Dalian City. His son has joined the army, and his daughter-in-law works in the commune. He lives alone at home and finds it tiring to go to the street to buy vegetables and grain every day. A few days ago, a salesperson from the vegetable group of the Shanzhong Street outlet of the commune's commercial group came to discuss with him and decided to deliver everything he needed for daily life to his door, so the old man wouldn't have to go out to buy things. Since then, every evening or morning, a salesperson comes to his house, introducing what the outlet has and asking what he wants to buy. It's delivered that evening or the next morning. Sometimes, the salesperson even takes time to wrap dumplings and make noodles for him. The old man is very touched. To thank the salesperson nurtured and educated by the Party for caring for his life, he specifically asked someone to write a letter to his son, telling him about his happy life at home and encouraging him to strive for meritorious service in the army.

    Currently, in Haiyan People's Commune, there are sixteen families with elderly, weak, or sick members who are not being cared for because the women are participating in various productions. The Shanzhong Street outlet delivers daily necessities to their homes according to their needs.

    菜蔬送上门
    李世祥老人，是旅大市甘井子区海燕人民公社的社员。他的儿子参军了，儿媳妇在社里参加劳动，他在家里生活没人照顾，每日上街买菜、买粮感到累。前些天，公社商业组山中街门市部菜组的一个售货同志来和他商量，决定每天把他生活所需要的东西送上门，不用老人家出门买东西。此后，在每天晚上或早晨，就有一个售货员来到他家，一边介绍门市部里有些什么，一边问他要买什么。当天晚上或第二天早上就送来。有时，售货员同志还抽空来给他包饺子、做面条吃。这位老人很受感动。为了感谢党所培养和教育出来的售货员关心他的生活，他特意求人给儿子写信告诉他在家里的幸福生活，并鼓励他在部队里争取立功。
    现在，海燕人民公社有十六家有老、弱、病人，因为妇女参加各项生产而没人照顾，山中街门市部都根据他们的需要，每天把生活必需品送到家。
