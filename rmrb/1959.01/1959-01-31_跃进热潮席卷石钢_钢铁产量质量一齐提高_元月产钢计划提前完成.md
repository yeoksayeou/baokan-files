    The momentum of a greater leap forward in production and construction is forming at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company.
    The factory's January steel production plan was completed ahead of schedule at 2:00 PM on the 30th. The steel's qualification rate reached 99.47%, an increase of 5.35% compared to December of last year, which was the best month for quality last year. The utilization coefficient of most blast furnaces is growing rapidly, with the average utilization coefficient reaching 3.1 tons over the past 30 days. The installation of many pieces of equipment for the company's three major projects—Blast Furnace No. 3, Coke Oven No. 3, and the Sintering Plant—has also been completed ahead of schedule.
    Workers enthusiastically launched a competition to break through key areas, tap potential, learn from advanced experiences, and catch up with the advanced. After Blast Furnace No. 2 learned from the experience of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in increasing production by reducing the size of the burden, the charging workers on the third shift launched a rapid pulling and running competition, which increased the blast furnace's production level by 4% compared to December of last year in two weeks. The workers installing the main hoist for Blast Furnace No. 3 originally spent fifteen days installing this equipment at Anshan Iron and Steel. This time, ten technicians and fifteen apprentices worked closely together, and on the premise of ensuring installation quality, it only took them forty-six hours to install the main hoist.
    A massive production and construction upsurge is sweeping through every corner of the company. In recent days, factories and engineering companies under the company have held leap forward skill competitions one after another. The workers carried placards displaying new production achievements, beating gongs and drums to spread the good news everywhere. Leap forward platforms and suggestion stations at each production site are filled with workers' proposals for production innovations. (Attached picture)

    跃进热潮席卷石钢
    钢铁产量质量一齐提高　元月产钢计划提前完成
    本报讯　一个更大跃进的生产建设高潮，正在石景山钢铁公司形成。
    这个厂1月份钢的产量计划，已在30日下午二时提前完成。钢的合格率达到99.47％，比去年质量最好的12月份提高了5.35％。大部分高炉的利用系数在迅速增长，过去三十天的平均利用系数达到三点一吨。这个公司兴建的三高炉、三焦炉和烧结厂三大工程很多设备的安装工程，也都纷纷提前完成。
    职工群众热烈开展了突关键、挖潜力、学先进、赶先进的竞赛。二高炉学习太原钢铁公司增产经验把料批改小以后，三班的上料工人开展了快拉快跑的竞赛，两周使这个高炉的生产水平比去年12月份增长了4％。三高炉安装主卷扬机的工人，原在鞍钢安装这项设备时，安装工期为十五天。这次十个技工和十五个徒工密切配合，在保证安装质量的前提下，只用四十六小时就把主卷扬机安装好了。
    一个声势浩大的生产建设高潮，正在席卷着这个公司的每个角落。连日来，公司所属各厂和工程公司纷纷召开跃进比武大会。工人们抬着各种生产新成就的牌板敲锣打鼓到各处报喜。各生产现场的跃进台、献计台上贴满了职工们革新生产的建议。（附图片）
