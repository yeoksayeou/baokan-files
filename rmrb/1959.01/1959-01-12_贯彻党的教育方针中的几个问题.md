Editor's Note: The semi-monthly "Frontline," published on the 10th of this month, carried an article written by Comrades Yang Shu and Peng Peiyun, discussing several noteworthy issues in current school education: the combination of education and labor, the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of teachers and students under the leadership of the Party. The following is an abstract of this article, with subheadings added by the editor of this newspaper.

In Order to Improve the Quality of Education
Labor Teaching Cannot Be Abandoned

    First, teaching and labor. To implement the policy of combining education with productive labor in universities, the first problem to be solved is the combination of teaching and labor. Recent times have fully demonstrated that combining teaching and labor is very good. The method of only teaching and not laboring is no longer viable. The people our universities cultivate should be communist new people, socialist-minded and cultured laborers. How can such people be cultivated by only teaching and not laboring?
    Combining teaching and labor does not simply mean allowing labor to occupy a place in universities, with labor being labor and teaching being teaching, without allowing teaching to be affected by labor. In fact, the teaching plan, teaching content, teaching methods, and the entire educational system are being significantly influenced by labor. Teaching has been infiltrated by labor, becoming brand-new teaching. Many facts during the Great Leap Forward in universities illustrate that once teaching is combined with productive labor, the teaching content becomes richer and more practical, and the teaching methods are greatly improved. For example, the automobile and tractor major at Tsinghua University, in the past, did not pay much attention to combining with productive labor. As a result, after learning "Automobile Construction," and even participating in internships, they still could not disassemble and assemble cars themselves. Originally, the past internships were not participating in productive labor, but simply putting up a model engine, and even the screws were loosened by the workers in advance, and then the students "practiced" it once. Naturally, this teaching method could not achieve much results. After implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, they studied "Automobile Construction" while directly participating in productive labor. Now, they not only have a deep understanding of "Automobile Construction," but also can skillfully repair various automobiles. Finally, based on rich practical experience, they wrote a "Automobile Repair" textbook.
    With the correct policy, there must also be correct leadership and methods to combine education and productive labor well. To this end, many schools have arranged teaching time and labor time to ensure both. If labor is not included in the teaching plan and labor time cannot be guaranteed, the quality of education will not be improved. Similarly, if teaching time is too short, the courses that should be learned are not learned, or learned less, it will also reduce the quality of education. The proportion of productive labor in the teaching plan should be specified separately according to different types of schools or departments.
    In order to combine teaching and productive labor well, it is also necessary to create various conditions and adopt various methods. Students' participation in labor should be combined with the teaching content as much as possible, and labor that is adapted to the teaching content should be arranged according to the characteristics of the grades. The purpose of students participating in labor is not only to produce products or solve the problem of lack of labor in production, but mainly to cultivate themselves into communist new people and improve the quality of learning. To achieve this goal, education must be combined with productive labor. Participating in productive labor is a political lesson, which plays an important role in exercising and transforming students' thinking. This is the combination of education and labor. There is a lot of productive labor, and it is combined with the major. In this way, students learn their major courses vividly and well. This is also the combination of education and labor.
    After labor is incorporated into the teaching plan, the teaching methods must be changed accordingly. Some courses can also adopt on-site teaching methods, combining production labor to teach some principles. However, systematic lecturing in the classroom is still important. The teaching experience accumulated over many years should also be critically inherited. In short, the implementation of the educational policy is still in its initial stage, and everyone needs to constantly create and experiment in practice and summarize experience.

Must Persist in Combining with Reality
But Also Prevent Neglecting Theory

    Second, theory and practice. The combination of education and productive labor greatly strengthens the combination of theory and practice, because production activities are the basic practical activities of mankind. If we only generally advocate the combination of theory and practice, without combining education with productive labor, it is not easy to thoroughly solve the problem of combining theory and practice. After science and engineering students participate in productive labor, they combine the theory learned in the classroom with production practice, exercise their ability to solve practical problems, and consolidate and deepen their understanding of theory. The many inventions and creations that have emerged during this period are the fruitful results of the combination of theory and practice. In the past, teachers and students of liberal arts and law rarely went to the countryside and factories. Even if they did, they rarely participated in productive labor and could not integrate with workers and peasants. Therefore, it was impossible to have a true understanding of social reality. Now, they have conducted extensive and in-depth investigations and research in common labor with workers and peasants. As a result, they have studied the theory of our country's revolution and construction more deeply and have written many articles that combine theory with practice.
    In order to cultivate students into people who have both theoretical knowledge and can solve practical problems, they should be allowed to come into contact with practice and do some practical work before graduation in addition to reading. Because all true knowledge originates from direct experience. Personally participating in production practice and social practice, acquiring rich perceptual knowledge, and then summarizing and improving it, can enable them to learn truly and thoroughly.
    However, university students spend more time learning theoretical knowledge. Book knowledge is the theory written by predecessors summarizing the experience of production struggle and class struggle. People cannot experience everything directly. In fact, most of the knowledge is indirect experience from others, including the indirect experience of ancient people and foreigners. This knowledge should be studied critically, and should be appropriately linked to historical reality and current reality. During this period, we have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois ideology of belittling productive labor and belittling practice, and the dogmatic style of learning that separates theory and practice, and achieved great results. This criticism still needs to be continued in the future. But now we must also prevent another one-sidedness, that is, belittling theory, being satisfied with one's own local experience, and being unwilling to learn theories that are not directly related to current production. Existing universities bear the task of improvement, and especially need to pay attention to improving their teaching quality, and must not lower the original level. For example, the physics course in higher industrial schools is a basic theoretical course that describes some of the most essential phenomena and laws of nature. It not only prepares students for learning professional courses, but also enables students to have a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the entire material world, so as to more widely and deeply master the laws of nature, and be more creative in production and scientific research; it also cultivates students' dialectical materialism worldview through the physics course. Because the physics course in the past had the shortcoming of not being able to combine well with professional courses, some comrades advocated simply canceling the physics course, and putting various parts of the physics course into relevant technical foundation courses and professional courses (such as electrical engineering and thermal engineering). This approach has the danger of weakening the knowledge of basic theory and is not appropriate.
    The bourgeois idealist academic thought must be continued to be criticized in depth. In the past six months, the mass criticism movement against bourgeois academic thought in universities has achieved great results, and now we need to consolidate and expand the results of this movement. Thoroughly criticizing bourgeois academic thought is a long and arduous struggle, and we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements. We should further improve the level of Marxist theory, master more materials, learn to conduct scientific analysis, and better combine revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit to prevent simplification and one-sidedness in criticism. In order to conduct in-depth academic criticism and promote scientific progress and cultural prosperity, we should implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and distinguish the debate on academic issues from political problems. The implementation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend does not weaken the leading position of Marxism in the ideological sphere, on the contrary, it strengthens this position.

   Both Need to Implement the Mass Line
    And Give Play to the Role of Teachers

    Third, the combination of teachers and students under the leadership of the Party. Should the work of universities take the mass line? Some professors and experts do not approve of taking the mass line. They believe that young people have shallow knowledge and have no right to speak in teaching work, and are not qualified to participate in scientific research work. However, young teaching staff and young students have refuted this view with their own practical actions. Although they lack knowledge and experience, they have made many outstanding achievements due to their ideological liberation and full of energy, relying on the strength of the collective. Facts have proved that only by fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses can universities be run well. Of course, this does not mean that professors and experts have no role to play. On the contrary, implementing the Party's mass line requires mobilizing all positive factors within the school and correctly combining the role of professors and experts with the role of the masses. Most of the old teachers have made progress in their thinking to varying degrees after the education of various movements in the past year, and expressed their willingness to accept the leadership of the Party and transform themselves. Many people have participated in various production practices and social practices, and some have also gone to factories and the countryside to participate in labor within their capacity. In terms of business, after the test of practical work and the criticism of academic thought, they have a more practical understanding of their knowledge and abilities. Therefore, now we have more favorable conditions to unite and transform them, and strive to win over all possible professors, lecturers, and researchers to serve the proletarian education and cultural and scientific undertakings, and play a greater role in the socialist construction. In the past, some young people blindly believed in experts and professors, which was of course wrong and should be broken. However, it should also be seen that many old teachers have mastered more book knowledge, much of which is useful, and young people should learn from them. During this period, young students have made many achievements in scientific research. The knowledge that teachers taught them in the past played a role in this, and these achievements were achieved under the guidance and help of teachers who actively served socialism and were knowledgeable. We hope that teachers and students, old teachers and young teachers will establish new relationships of unity and mutual assistance, and work together to implement the Party's education policy. At the same time, teachers should be responsible for teaching well and give full play to their role in teaching.
    Strengthening the Party's leadership is the key to running schools well. The experience of the past year fully proves that the Party is fully capable of leading higher education and scientific undertakings, and the Party's leadership must continue to be strengthened in the future. The Party organizations in schools should be good at combining education with productive labor, focusing on teaching, and making proper and comprehensive arrangements for teaching, scientific research, productive labor, as well as sports, mass cultural activities, and other tasks. At present, the most important task is to combine education and productive labor well and continuously improve the quality of teaching. Party organizations should promote the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts. Any work must be good at consulting with the masses and listening to various opinions. For people with shortcomings and mistakes within the people, only the method of persuasion and education can be adopted, and the method of coercion must not be adopted. Strengthening the Party's leadership first requires strengthening the leadership of guidelines, policies, and political thought. Universities should implement the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on education, and give full play to the role of teaching and administrative organizations at all levels. This is not only conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of non-Party personnel and strengthening their sense of responsibility, but also enables the Party's leadership to avoid being trapped in too many administrative affairs.

    贯彻党的教育方针中的几个问题
    杨述　彭佩云
    编者按：本月10日出版的“前线”半月刊，刊载了杨述、彭佩云同志写的一篇文章，对目前学校教育中几个值得注意的问题：教育与劳动结合的问题、理论与实际结合的问题以及党的领导下的教师和学生结合的问题作了论述。下面是这篇文章的摘要，插题是本报编者加的。为了提高教育质量
  劳动教学不能偏废
    第一，教学和劳动。在高等学校里执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，首先就要解决又教学又劳动这个问题。最近一个时期内，已经充分地证明：又教学又劳动，好得很。只教学不劳动的办法行不通了。我们的大学培养出来的人应该是共产主义新人，应该是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。只教学不劳动，那里能培养出来这样的人？
    又教学又劳动，并不是只让劳动在高等学校占领一个席位，劳动是劳动，教学是教学，不让教学受到劳动的影响。事实上是教学计划、教学内容、教学方法以及整个教育制度，都正在受到劳动的重大的影响。教学受到了劳动的渗透，成为崭新的教学。高等学校大跃进中许多事实，说明了教学一经与生产劳动结合，使得教学内容更加丰富更切实际，教学方法也有了很大的改进。如清华大学汽车拖拉机专业，过去因为不大注意结合生产劳动，结果是学了“汽车构造学”，还参加了实习，却不会自己拆装汽车。原来过去的实习，不是参加生产劳动，只不过是摆了一台做样子的发动机，甚至螺丝钉也事先由工人拧松，然后由学生“演习”一遍，这种教学方法自然收不了多大成效。贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针后，他们一边学习“汽车构造学”，一边直接参加生产劳动。现在不仅对“汽车构造学”理解得深刻，而且能熟练地修理各种汽车，最后还根据丰富的实际经验，写成一本“汽车修理学”。
    有了正确的方针，还要有正确的领导和方法，使教育和生产劳动很好地结合起来。为此，许多学校把教学时间和劳动时间作了安排，以保证教学时间与劳动时间。如果劳动不列入教学计划，劳动时间不能保证，教育质量将不会提高。同样，如果教学时间过少，应该学的课没有学，或者学少了，也会降低教育质量。生产劳动在教学计划中所占比例应当按照不同类型的学校或系级分别规定。
    为了使教学和生产劳动很好结合，还要创造各种条件，采取各种办法。学生参加劳动要尽可能和教学内容结合，并按照年级的特点安排与教学内容相适应的劳动，通过劳动提高学习质量。学生参加劳动并不是仅仅为了生产出产品，或者解决生产中缺乏劳动力的问题，而主要地是要使自己培养成为共产主义新人，使学习质量提高。为了达到这个目的，教育必须与生产劳动相结合。参加生产劳动是一门政治课，在锻炼和改造学生的思想方面有重要的作用。这是教育与劳动的结合。有许多生产劳动并且是和专业相结合的。这样，使学生学习专业课时学得活，学得好。这也是教育与劳动的结合。
    劳动纳入教学计划以后，教学方式必须随之改变。有些课程也可以采取现场教学的办法，结合生产劳动讲授一些原理。但是课堂上的系统讲授仍然是重要的。多年积累起来的教学工作经验还应当批判地继承下来。总之，目前贯彻教育方针还在开始，还需要大家在实践中不断地创造试验并总结出经验来。必须坚持结合实际
  也要防止轻视理论
    第二，理论与实际，教育与生产劳动的结合，大大加强了理论与实际的结合，因为生产活动是人类基本的实践活动。如果我们只是一般地提倡理论与实际结合，而不把教育与生产劳动结合起来，就不容易彻底解决理论与实际结合的问题。理工科的学生参加生产劳动以后，把课堂上学到的理论和生产实践结合起来，锻炼了解决实际问题的能力，巩固加深了对理论的认识，这个时期涌现出来的许多创造发明便是理论和实际结合的硕果。从前，文法科的师生很少下乡下厂，既使下去也很少参加生产劳动，不能和工农打成一片，因此也就不可能对社会实际生活有真正的了解，现在他们在和工农共同劳动中进行了广泛深入的调查研究，因此对于我国革命和建设的理论学习得比较深入了，并且写出了不少理论联系实际的文章。
    为了培养学生成为既有理论知识又能解决实际问题的人，应当让他们毕业之前除读书以外，也能接触实际，作一些实际工作。因为一切真知都是从直接经验发源的，亲身参加生产实践和社会实践，取得丰富的感性知识，再加以总结提高，就能学得真、学得透。
    但是，高等学校的学生较多的时间还是学习理论知识。书本知识是前人总结生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验写成的理论。人不能事事直接经验。事实上多数的知识都是别人的间接经验。包括古人和外国人的间接经验。对于这些知识，应该批判地学习，应该适当地和历史实际和当前实际联系起来。这一个时期，我们对于轻视生产劳动、轻视实际的资产阶级思想和把理论和实际分割开来的教条主义学风进行了彻底的批判，收到了很大的成效，这种批判今后还需要继续进行。但是现在也要防止产生另一种片面性，那就是轻视理论，满足于自己的局部经验，凡是与当前生产没有直接关系的理论就不愿意去学习。现有的高等学校担负着提高的任务，尤其需要注意提高自己的教学质量，决不能降低原有的水平。例如高等工业学校的物理课是讲述自然界一些最本质的现象与规律的一门基础理论课，它不仅要为学生学习专业课作准备，还要使学生对整个物质世界有一个全面的系统的了解，以便更广泛、更深入地掌握自然规律，在生产和科学研究中更加富有创造性；还要通过物理课培养学生辩证唯物主义的世界观。由于过去物理课存在着不能与专业课很好结合的缺点，有些同志就主张干脆取消物理课，而把物理课中各个部分分别放到有关的技术基础课和专业课（如电工学、热工学）去讲。这种做法有削弱基础理论知识的危险，是不妥当的。
    对于资产阶级唯心主义的学术思想，必须继续深入地展开批判。半年来，高等学校里对资产阶级学术思想展开的群众性的批判运动取得了很大的成绩，现在需要巩固和扩大这个运动的战果。彻底批判资产阶级学术思想是一个长期而艰巨的斗争，我们决不能满足于已有的成绩，应该进一步提高马克思主义理论水平，更加大量地掌握材料，学会进行科学的分析，把革命精神和科学精神更好地结合起来，防止批判中的简单化和片面性。为了深入进行学术批判，促进科学进步、文化繁荣，应当贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，把学术问题的争论和政治问题区别开来。实行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针并不会削弱马克思主义在思想界的领导地位，相反地正是会加强它的这种地位。
      既要贯彻群众路线
        又要发挥教师作用
    第三，党的领导下的教师和学生结合。高等学校的工作要不要走群众路线？有些教授专家们是不赞成走群众路线的。他们认为青年人知识浅薄，在教学工作中没有发言权，科学研究工作也没有资格参加，但是青年教学人员和青年学生却以自己的实际行动驳倒了这种意见。他们虽然知识经验不足，但是由于思想解放，干劲足，依靠着集体的力量，作出了许多出色的成绩。事实证明，只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，才能把高等学校办好。当然，这并不是说教授、专家就没有作用，相反地，贯彻党的群众路线，要求调动学校内的一切积极因素，把教授专家的作用和群众的作用正确地结合起来。大多数的老教师经过一年来各种运动的教育，思想上都有了不同程度的进步，表示愿意接受党的领导，改造自己。许多人参加了各种生产实践和社会实践，有些人还下厂下乡参加了力所能及的劳动。在业务方面，经过实际工作的考验和学术思想的批判，他们对于自己的知识和能力有了比较切实的认识。因此，现在我们有着更有利的条件去团结改造他们，争取一切可能争取的教授、讲师和研究人员，为无产阶级的教育事业和文化科学事业服务，在社会主义建设事业中起更多的作用。过去有些青年人迷信专家教授，当然是不对的，应当破除迷信；但是也应当看到，很多老教师掌握了比较多的书本知识，其中有许多是有用处的，青年人应当向他们学习。这一时期，青年学生在科学研究方面作出了许多成绩，过去教师教给他们的知识对此起了作用，而且这些成绩是在积极为社会主义服务的和有学问的教师指导和帮助下才取得的。我们希望教师和学生，老教师和青年教师建立团结互助的新关系，共同努力贯彻党的教育方针。同时，教师应当负责教好书，在教学方面充分发挥自己的作用。
    加强党的领导是办好学校的关键，一年来的经验充分说明了党是完全能够领导高等教育和科学事业的，今后必须继续加强党的领导。学校党的组织要善于把教育和生产劳动结合起来，以教学为主，把教学、科学研究、生产劳动以及体育、群众文化活动和其他各项工作，作妥善地全面安排。当前，最重要的任务是使教育和生产劳动结合好，不断提高教学的质量。党的组织应当发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风。任何工作必须善于和群众商量，倾听各种意见。对待人民内部有缺点和错误的人，只能采取说服教育的办法，决不能采取压服的办法。加强党的领导首先要加强方针、政策和政治思想的领导。高等学校应当按照党中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示，实行党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，把各级教学行政组织的作用都充分发挥起来，这样既有利于发挥非党工作人员的积极性和加强他们的责任心，也可以使党的领导避免陷于过多的行政事务。
