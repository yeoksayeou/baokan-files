Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: What will Africa be like in 1959? Looking ahead at what some Western politicians call the "overriding international problem," even many bourgeois newspaper reporters do not hesitate to answer that the "contagious" national independence struggles will rise and fall, and will inevitably converge into a surging torrent.

The new calendar of Africa's anti-colonial struggle in 1959 was opened by the Congolese people. The sparks of struggle are still flashing. The Paris "Radical News" commented on the various attempts by the Belgian colonial authorities to extinguish the Congolese people's anger, lamenting that the seeds had already been sown. The "New York Times" of January 7th blurted out in alarm: the Congo must not become "another Algeria."

The struggle of the Congolese people is closely linked to the struggles of the people in vast areas of Africa. The All-African People's Conference held in Accra last December was another major event in the political life of the African people, following the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and the Conference of Independent African States. This grand gathering, the first of its kind held in Africa, greatly strengthened the unity and strength of the African people in the anti-colonial struggle. Now, the imperialist colonial system in Africa is not only cracking, but collapsing in swathes. Looking at the African continent, the world's second-largest continent with 30 million square kilometers, the number of independent countries has increased from four to eleven in the past seven years. The area of independent countries is 11 million square kilometers, accounting for more than one-third of the continent. The population of independent countries is about 100 million, nearly half of the continent's population.

In some countries scheduled to gain independence in the next year or two, emotions are running high, and they are striving to achieve their goals ahead of schedule or on time. These countries include: Cameroon, Togo, Nigeria, Somaliland.

Due to the violent suppression by the colonizers, the areas where national independence is sought through armed struggle have expanded and developed further. The Algerian people's national independence war, which has been going on for more than four years, is a shining example. The country is becoming stronger as it fights. In addition, the people of Cameroon are in high spirits, and they have persisted in armed struggle for more than three years.

In East Africa, Black Africa, and Central Africa, the political situation is changing. The most developed Buganda kingdom in Uganda has recently issued calls for independence. Tanganyika and Kenya are demanding further constitutional reforms from Britain. The independence of Guinea and the federation of Ghana and Guinea have had an important impact on Africa. The struggle of the people of Central Africa to dissolve the Central African Federation, which was established purely for the benefit of British rulers, will also develop. According to the "Washington Post," Southern Rhodesia will become one of the areas of fierce resistance, including strategic strikes, boycotts of colonial goods, and civil disobedience movements.

The South African federal government, which adheres to a barbaric policy of racial discrimination, is worried that after the All-African People's Conference, it may encounter boycotts of South African trade by African independent countries and African people. The struggle against racial discrimination there has never stopped.

Recently, the struggle for independence and liberation in Africa has been intertwined with the "organization of federations." It is reported that some leaders of countries that have already gained independence have stated that the goal of organizing federations is to eliminate the traces of artificial division by imperialism, concentrate the strength of member states to develop their own natural resources, and jointly embark on the road to prosperity and strength. It is worth noting that imperialism also wants to use the "federations" they organize to consolidate their colonial rule.

According to Western newspapers, the awakening of Africa has greatly alarmed the Western colonial rulers. On the one hand, they are adopting a high-pressure policy, attempting to extinguish Africa's national independence movement; on the other hand, they are also attempting to use deception, appeasement, and even making certain concessions, to continue to control Africa politically and economically. The planners of the "Euro-African Community" dream of using European capital to exploit Africa's natural resources and exploit Africa's cheap labor, thereby seizing the highest profits.

Dreams may not come true. Prime Minister Nkrumah said that once people are in the ranks of the anti-colonial struggle, it is impossible to turn back.

People are now aware of the conspiracy of American neo-colonialism. On the one hand, the United States is actively participating in the planning of the "Euro-African Community" plan, trying to further intervene in Africa along with European capital; on the other hand, it is brewing to take advantage of the precarious situation of European colonial rule over Africa, hypocritically expressing "catering to the wishes of the African people," and putting on the disguise of "financial and technical assistance" to carry out the purpose of colonial rule over Africa.

However, the various desperate struggles of the imperialist demons cannot stop the rising sun of the African national independence movement. Now, the east wind is blowing strongly, Africa is advancing, and the day when the imperialists will be completely driven out of Africa is not far away.

### 民族独立的洪流激荡着非洲  刚果人民揭开了今年反殖民主义斗争的第一页  帝国主义的挣扎顽抗不能挽救殖民体系的崩溃

    民族独立的洪流激荡着非洲
    刚果人民揭开了今年反殖民主义斗争的第一页
    帝国主义的挣扎顽抗不能挽救殖民体系的崩溃
    新华社23日讯　1959年的非洲将会是怎么样？展望这个被某些西方政客称为“压倒一切的国际问题”时，连许多资产阶级报刊记者都毫不犹豫地回答说，“富有传染性”的民族独立斗争将彼落此起，而且将不可避免地汇合成一股汹涌的洪流。
    1959年的非洲反殖民主义斗争的新日历由刚果人民揭开了第一张。斗争的火花还在闪耀。巴黎
  “激进新闻报”在评论比利时殖民当局种种想扑灭刚果人民怒火的企图时感叹地说，火种已经种上了。1月7日的“纽约时报”失口惊呼：刚果不要成为“另一个阿尔及利亚”。
    刚果人民的斗争同非洲广大地区人民的斗争是紧密关联着的。去年12月在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会，是非洲人民的政治生活上，继亚非国家万隆会议、亚非人民的团结大会、非洲独立国家会议之后的又一重大事件。这个第一次在非洲举行的规模盛大的集会，大大加强了非洲人民在反殖民主义斗争中的团结和力量。现在，帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系不仅是裂开缺口，而是成片成片地瓦解了。放眼非洲大陆，七年以来，独立国家已经从四个增加到十一个。在这个三千万平方公里的世界第二大陆上，独立国家的面积已有一千一百万平方公里，占三分之一以上。独立国家的人口已有一亿左右，将近大陆人口的二分之一。
    预定在最近一两年内获得独立的一些国家内，群情激动，他们正努力争取提前或按期达到目标。这些国家包括：喀麦隆、多哥、尼日利亚、索马里兰。
    由于殖民者采用暴力进行镇压，以武装斗争形式来争取民族独立的地区更加扩大和发展了。进行了四年多的阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立战争，是一个光辉的例子。这个国家愈战愈强。此外，喀麦隆的人民斗志高昂，他们已经坚持了三年多的武装斗争。
    在东非、黑非洲和中非，政治局面在发生变化。乌干达的最发达的布干达王国在最近传出了要求独立的呼声。坦噶尼喀和怯尼亚正在要求英国作出进一步的宪法改革。几内亚的独立以及加纳和几内亚结成联邦，在非洲产生了重要的影响。中非人民为解散纯粹出于英国统治者的利益而建立的中非联邦的斗争也将有所发展。根据“华盛顿邮报”的消息，南罗得西亚将成为激烈的反抗性地区之一，反抗行动将包括战略罢工，抵制殖民国家货物、公民不服从运动等。
    坚持野蛮的种族歧视政策的南非联邦政府正担忧在全非人民大会后可能会遇到非洲独立国家和非洲人民对南非贸易的抵制。那里的反种族歧视的斗争一直没有中断过。
    最近以来，非洲在争取独立和解放的斗争中交织着“组织联邦”的行动。据报道，某些已经获得独立的国家领袖表示，组织联邦的目标是要消除帝国主义人为分割的痕迹，集中成员国的力量开发自己的自然资源，共同走上富强的道路。值得注意的是，帝国主义也想假借他们组织的“联邦”来巩固他们的殖民统治。
    据西方报刊报道，非洲的觉醒，使西方殖民统治者大为惊慌。他们一方面采取高压政策，妄想扑灭非洲的民族独立运动；另一方面也企图用欺骗、笼络甚至作出某些让步的策略，来在政治上和经济上继续控制非洲。“欧非共同体”的策划者们就是梦想用欧洲的资本来榨取非洲的自然资源和剥削非洲的廉价劳动力，从而攫取最高额的利润。
    美梦未必能应验。恩克鲁玛总理说，人们一旦置身于反殖民主义斗争的行列，就不可能再转过身来。
    人们现在已经认识到美国新殖民主义的阴谋。美国一方面积极参加“欧非共同体”计划的策划，力图随着欧洲资本进一步插手非洲；另一方面，正在酝酿利用欧洲殖民国家对非洲统治摇摇欲坠的时机，假惺惺地作出“迎合非洲人民愿望”的表示，披上“财政和技术援助”的伪装，来施行对非洲殖民统治的目的。
    但是，帝国主义魑魅们的种种挣扎顽抗，不能阻住非洲民族独立运动的东升旭日。现在是，东风正在劲吹，非洲正在前进，帝国主义者被全部赶出非洲的日子已经为期不远了。
