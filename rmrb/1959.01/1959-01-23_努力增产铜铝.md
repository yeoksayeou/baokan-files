    Strive to Increase Copper and Aluminum Production
    Today we published the news about Shandong's development of copper and aluminum production, with the aim of drawing everyone's attention to these two industries. As everyone knows, copper and aluminum are the most important materials for manufacturing power generation equipment. This year, the manufacturing of power generation equipment will increase several times over last year, and copper and aluminum must correspondingly catch up to ensure that electricity takes the lead. At the same time, we hope that all regions will attach as much importance to the production of copper and aluminum as they do to steel production, and ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of copper and aluminum production tasks no matter what.
    Indigenous methods of copper smelting are an important aspect of developing copper production. This year, a significant portion of copper production plans rely on indigenous methods. Therefore, "small indigenous groups" for copper smelting need to be developed more extensively and deeply. Some places already have a certain foundation in indigenous copper smelting, and these places should pay attention to consolidation and improvement. At present, particular emphasis should be placed on grasping the technical reform of ore dressing. Because copper ore has a relatively low grade, generally only containing about 1% copper, if it is not crushed and dressed, it may be impossible to smelt copper due to too much waste rock mixed in, or it may consume too much fuel.
    In terms of aluminum smelting, the main task is to solve the raw material problem. Currently, some raw materials rely solely on a few large factories for production, and this situation cannot meet the needs. We suggest that places with suitable conditions consider building factories locally and producing locally to solve this problem.

    努力增产铜铝
    今天我们发表了山东发展铜铝生产的消息，目的是为了引起大家对这两种工业的重视。大家知道，铜和铝是制造发电设备最重要的材料。今年发电设备的制造将比去年增加好几倍，铜和铝必须相应地赶上去，才能保证电力先行。同时，我们希望各个地区要像重视钢铁生产那样重视铜铝的生产，无论如何要保证完成和力争超额完成铜和铝的生产任务。
    土法炼铜是发展铜的生产的一个重要方面，今年铜的生产计划中，有不少要靠土法生产。因此，炼铜的“小土群”需要更广泛、更深入地开展。有些地方土法炼铜已经有一定的基础，这些地方应当注意巩固、提高的工作。在目前，尤应突出地抓选矿的技术改革工作。因为铜矿的品位比较低，一般仅含铜1％左右，如果不经过破碎和选矿，就可能由于混入的废石太多而炼不出铜来，或者是消耗燃料太多。
    在炼铝方面，主要的是要解决原料问题。现在有一些原料仅仅依靠少数大厂生产，这种状况是不能满足需要的。我们建议有条件的地方，考虑就地建厂就地生产来加以解决。
