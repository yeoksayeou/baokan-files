The Jin Southeast District Committee has mobilized the entire Party and all the people to summarize the experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward. This is a good thing that boosts morale and stimulates enthusiasm, and it is worth promoting greatly.

After a battle, seeing our brilliant results can boost our morale and diminish the enemy's prestige. In 1958, we worked hard for a year and achieved tremendous successes on all fronts. When planning this year's work, looking back to assess the achievements we have already made can allow us to see our strength more clearly and have a hundredfold confidence and greater enthusiasm in this year's Great Leap Forward.

The first great benefit of summarizing experience is that it allows us to more fully recognize our achievements. Some people may say that the great achievements of 1958 are there for all to see, and everyone can see them without summarizing. But that's not entirely true. Many aspects of achievements cannot be expressed in numbers, and people cannot see them at a glance or say them all at once. For example, the combination of education and productive labor. Everyone knows that our achievements in this area are indeed great. However, if you ask what aspects the achievements are reflected in, how to evaluate these achievements, and how the achievements were obtained, not to mention outsiders, even educators may not be able to answer these questions correctly and completely. If achievements are just empty concepts in our minds, they will not easily boost our morale and stimulate our enthusiasm. Only through systematic analysis and summarization can we fully recognize and evaluate the achievements we have made. Some aspects of achievements can be expressed in numbers, but numbers cannot fully explain their significance. For example, the small-scale indigenous furnaces on the steel front, their significance is far more than just the tons of steel smelted last year. Without careful summarization, it is not easy to fully see the great achievements beyond the numbers. The achievements are great, and we must have sufficient estimation of them, which is conducive to boosting our enthusiasm and morale.

The year of the Great Leap Forward was the year with the most practice. With more practice, there is more contact with the objective laws of the development of various things. Raising this understanding of objective laws from the perceptual stage to the rational stage can greatly boost our morale and greatly stimulate our enthusiasm. Confidence cannot come out of thin air. Comrade Mao Zedong talked about in "On Practice" that some comrades often say when they cannot bravely accept work tasks: they are not sure. The so-called "not sure" means that they do not have a regular understanding of the content and environment of this work. It can be seen that the basis of the so-called certainty and confidence is mainly the understanding of the objective laws of things. The more fully and thoroughly we understand the objective laws of things, the higher our morale will be, the greater our enthusiasm will be, and the easier it will be to give play to our subjective initiative. Last year, from the Party organizations of a region or a system to every ordinary worker, farmer, and staff member, through their own practice, they have had more exploration and understanding of the objective laws of things. Systematically summarizing them will make everyone feel that the conditions for this year's Great Leap Forward are much better than last year's. Not only is the material foundation more solid, but the regularity of the development of things is more and more deeply understood. With such confidence, we will ride the wind and waves and continue to move forward.

No matter how well anything is done, it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings. In last year's Great Leap Forward, we did many unprecedented things, and it was even more inevitable that some shortcomings occurred in our work. Our Party has always opposed concealing shortcomings, and advocated promoting achievements and overcoming shortcomings—even if these shortcomings are just a very small black spot in the face of brilliant achievements. To promote achievements, we must analyze and summarize the achievements and experiences. To overcome shortcomings, we must also analyze and summarize the shortcomings and lessons. Here, we must also strictly draw a line between ourselves and the "spectator faction" and "settling accounts faction." They stand outside the movement, have insufficient understanding of the achievements or are even indifferent, and are only focused on searching for this or that shortcoming. Separated from the achievements, they put certain shortcomings in isolation under a magnifying glass. When they see a black mole, they are alarmed and insist that the whole face of this person is black. Treating shortcomings in this way can only destroy our morale, drain our enthusiasm, and hold us back from making great strides forward. But every promoting faction is not like this. We summarize achievements and analyze shortcomings in order to overcome shortcomings and strive for greater victory and leap forward on the basis of victory.

    总结经验长志气
    易槐
    晋东南地委发动全党全民总结去年大跃进的经验，这是一件长志气鼓干劲的好事，值得大大提倡。
    作完了战，看到自己辉煌的战果，就可以长自己志气，灭敌人威风。1958年我们苦干了一年，在各条战线上都取得了巨大的成就，在规划今年工作的时候，回头来估量一下已经取得的成绩，可以使我们更清楚地看到自己的力量，在今年的大跃进中信心百倍，干劲更足。
    总结经验的第一个大好处，就是使我们可以更充分的认识成绩。有人也许会说，1958年的巨大成绩就在那里摆着，不用总结大家也都看得见。其实不尽然。很多方面的成绩不能用数字来表现，人们不可能一眼就能看到，一下就能说出。比如，教育和生产劳动相结合，谁也知道在这方面我们的成绩的确很大。可是，要问成绩究竟表现在哪些方面，怎样估价这些成绩，以及成绩是怎样得来的，莫说是外行人，就是教育工作者，怕也不是每一个人都能正确的完整的回答这些问题。成绩在我们的脑子里如果只是空洞的概念，它就不容易给我们长志气、鼓干劲。只有经过系统的分析总结，我们才能够充分认识和估价已经取得的成绩。有些方面的成绩虽然可以用数字表现，但是，数字也不能完全说明它们的意义。比如，钢铁战线上的小土群，它的意义就决不止于去年冶炼出多少吨钢铁，不经过认真的总结，就不容易全面看到它数字以外的巨大成绩。成绩很大，还要对它有足够的估计，才有利于我们鼓干劲、长志气。
    大跃进的一年是实践最多的一年。实践多，接触各种事物发展的客观规律就更多。把这种对于客观规律的认识从感性阶段提高到理性阶段，就可以大长我们的志气，大鼓我们的干劲。信心不能凭空而来。毛泽东同志在实践论中谈到，有些同志在不能勇敢接受工作任务时常说：没有把握，所谓“没有把握”，就是说他对这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解。可见，所谓把握和信心的基础，最主要的还是对事物的客观规律的理解。对事物的客观规律了解得越充分越透彻，我们的志气就越高，干劲就越大，主观能动性就越容易发挥。去年一年，上自一个地区一个系统的党组织，下至每一个普通的工人、农民和工作人员，都通过自己的实践，对事物的客观规律有了更多的探讨和认识，把它系统地总结出来，就会使每一个人都感觉到今年大跃进的条件比去年要好得多，不但物质基础更为雄厚了，而且对事物发展的规律性认识得更多更深了。有了这样的信心，就会乘风破浪继续前进。
    任何一件事情，不论做得多好，都难免会有一些缺点。去年的大跃进，我们作了很多前无古人的事情，工作中发生一些缺点更为难免。我们党一向反对隐瞒缺点，而主张发扬成绩克服缺点——即使这些缺点在光辉灿烂的成绩面前只是一个极小的黑斑。要发扬成绩，就要对成绩进行分析和总结经验。要克服缺点，也要对缺点进行分析和总结教训。这里，我们和观潮派算账派也要严格划清界限。他们站在运动之外，对成绩认识不足甚至无动于衷，一心要搜寻这样那样的缺点，脱离了成绩，把某些缺点孤立地放在放大镜下，看到一颗黑痣，就大惊小怪地硬说这个人的整个面孔都是黑的。这样对待缺点，只能灭我们的志气、泄我们的干劲、拖住我们不让大步前进。而每一个促进派却不是如此，我们总结成绩和分析缺点是为了克服缺点，争取在胜利的基础上走向更大的胜利跃进。
