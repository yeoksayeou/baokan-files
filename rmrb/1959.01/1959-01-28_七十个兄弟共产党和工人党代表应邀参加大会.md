Moscow, January 27th (By Our Correspondent) - Today, Moscow's atmosphere feels different than usual, filled with a joyous, festive mood. The Kremlin walls, the snow-covered fir trees, and the red star shining atop the Spassky Tower are all bathed in a bright and radiant glow.

Early in the morning, delegates headed towards the Great Kremlin Palace. Among the crowds, you could see old warriors who had participated in underground struggles and strike struggles before the October Revolution, standard-bearers who had marched through the streets holding red flags during the days when revolutionary thunder resounded in Petrograd, heroic sons and daughters who had rendered outstanding service to the motherland in the Great Patriotic War, and outstanding figures who had demonstrated their great skills in the pre-war and post-war Five-Year Plans. The elite of the older and younger generations of the Soviet people were all heading to the venue.

At precisely 10:00 AM Moscow time, the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, appeared on the rostrum, and the entire hall rose and cheered enthusiastically. The delegates cheered the wisdom and correctness of the leadership of the CPSU Central Committee, and cheered the great and brilliant achievements of the Soviet Party and people in communist construction.

Outstanding fighters from the international communist and workers' movement from all over the world also appeared on the rostrum. Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties from a total of seventy countries came to participate in the 21st Party Congress. The 21st Party Congress is being held in an environment of greatly increased strength of the socialist camp. The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day. All the delegates stood up to pay tribute and cheer the outstanding representatives of the people from all over the world. The entire venue was immersed in a joyous atmosphere.

A component of the great program of Soviet communist construction – the Seven-Year Plan report – began. Amidst enthusiastic applause, Comrade Khrushchev stepped onto the podium. He said that the Congress was convened to discuss the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965. This is a great program. Its scale is unprecedented. Comrade Khrushchev described in detail the great achievements of the Soviet Union, and then pointed out that the Soviet people now have the opportunity to enter a new and important period of development - a period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction. Comrade Khrushchev's lengthy report was warmly welcomed by the delegates and the representatives of fraternal parties attending the Congress.

    七十个兄弟共产党和工人党代表应邀参加大会
    本报莫斯科27日电　今天莫斯科的气氛显得不同往常，人们充满了欢欣鼓舞的节日似的情绪。克里姆林的宫墙、披着白雪的枞树、斯巴斯克塔的钟楼上闪耀着的红星，都染上了一层明亮焕发的光彩。
    一清早，代表们就走向大克里姆林宫。在人群当中，你可以看到那在十月革命前参加过地下斗争和罢工斗争的老战士，那在彼得堡的革命雷霆震响着的日子里撑着红旗在街上前进的旗手，那在卫国战争中给祖国立下了汗马功劳的英雄儿女，那在战前和战后几个五年计划中大显身手的卓越人物，老一代和青年一代苏联人民中的精英，都走向会场来了。
    莫斯科时间上午十点整，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党领导人员出现在主席台上，全场起立，热烈欢呼。代表们欢呼苏共中央委员会领导的英明和正确，欢呼苏联党和人民在共产主义建设中的伟大辉煌成就。
    来自世界各国的国际共产主义和工人运动的杰出战士们也出现在主席台上了。一共有七十个国家的共产党和工人党的代表来参加二十一次党代会。二十一次党代会是在社会主义阵营的力量大大高涨的环境下召开的。敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。全体代表起立向来自世界各国人民的优秀的代表致敬、欢呼。整个会场沉浸着欢乐的情绪。
    一个苏联共产主义建设伟大纲领的组成部分——七年计划报告开始了。在一片热烈掌声中，赫鲁晓夫同志走上讲台。他说，代表大会是为讨论1959到1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字而召开的。这是一个伟大的纲领。它的规模是史无前例的。赫鲁晓夫同志详细地叙述了苏联的伟大成就，接着指出，苏联人民现在有可能进入新的重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义建设的时期。赫鲁晓夫同志的长篇报告，受到了代表们和参加大会的各兄弟党代表的热烈欢迎。
