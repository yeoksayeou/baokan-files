    The contract system is an important means for the state to implement planned leadership over the people's communes. It can specifically connect the state plan with the commune plan. In the long period to come, it will be an important form of commercial integration between the state and the communes. The establishment of the people's communes is conducive to strengthening planning and promoting the implementation of the contract system. Promoting this system should become an important task of commercial work.

    合同制度是国家对人民公社实行计划领导的一种重要手段，它能够把国家计划同公社计划具体地衔接起来，在今后的长时期中它将是国家同公社之间商业结合的重要形式。人民公社的建立，有利于计划性的加强，有利于合同制的推行。推广这种制度应当成为商业工作的一项重要任务。
