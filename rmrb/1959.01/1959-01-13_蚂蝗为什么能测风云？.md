Why Can Leeches Predict the Weather?
　　Lián Shēng
    The People's Daily once published an article entitled "Leeches – Living Barometers," introducing the very effective and interesting local method used by the Chánghòu People's Commune in Nán County, Hunan Province, to forecast the weather using leeches.

    Leeches belong to the class Hirudinea of the phylum Annelida, with many fine rings on the surface of their bodies. Inside their bodies, the head has a relatively developed brain and a pair of fused ventral nerve cords, in addition to circulatory, excretory, and reproductive organs. Therefore, they are not very primitive animals. Usually, they adhere to stones at the bottom of the water or on the edges of ponds, and sometimes they crawl along stone crevices. If taken and placed in a small bottle filled with water, they can still survive, but because they are in closer contact with the outside world, they are easily affected by external climate.

    Before a rain, the changes in the atmosphere are significant. Vertical movements in the atmosphere can cause air to rise and cool, and also cause air to sink and warm. These atmospheric changes vary depending on the type of rain, so the air pressure fluctuates, but generally, the air pressure drops before rain. Before rain, not only does the air pressure decrease, but the humidity on the ground also increases, and the air mass is filled with sufficient moisture. Changes in air pressure and humidity affect the leech's respiration. They do not have special respiratory organs, but use their skin, which contains many capillaries, to exchange gases. Precisely because they breathe through their skin, they are more sensitive to these changes. Normally, the pressure inside the leech's body and the atmospheric pressure are balanced, and it stays at the bottom of the water according to its habits. When the atmospheric pressure drops, the leech's respiration is not as smooth as usual, so it floats to the surface of the water or moves up and down. In this way, the changes in the leech's living habits before rain inadvertently serve as a barometer.

    Those who are good at fishing are adept at casting their lines on cloudy days or in the evening, when fish often float to the surface and are easily caught. The principle is similar.

    蚂蝗为什么能测风云？
    连升
    人民日报上曾登载了“蚂蝗——活的气象仪”一文，介绍湖南省南县长厚人民公社用蚂蝗来预报天气，这一土办法很灵验，也很有趣。
    蚂蝗是属于环节动物水蛭纲，身体表面有许多细致的环纹。它的身体里面，头部有较发达的脑和一对并合的腹神经索，另外还有循环、排泄和生殖器官。所以，它并不是很低等的动物，平时它常吸附在水底或水池边缘的石块上，有时还会沿着石缝蠕动，如将它取来放入盛水的小瓶中，虽然照样生存，但因与外界接触较近，容易受到外界气候的影响。
    下雨前夕，大气中的变化是很大的，大气中的垂直运动可引起空气上升，使空气冷却；同时，也可引起空气下沉，使空气增热，这种大气中的变化是随各种类型的雨性而不同，因此，气压有了高低的变化，不过一般雨前是气压变低。雨前不仅气压变低而且地面上的湿度也增大，气团中充满了足够的含水量。气压与湿度的变化使蚂蝗的呼吸作用受到了影响。它没有特殊的呼吸器官，只是用含有许多微血管的皮肤进行气体交换。也正因为是用皮肤呼吸，所以对此感受更为敏感。平时蚂蝗体内与大气气压两者压力平衡，它就按照自己的生活习性伏在水底。当大气中气压变低时，蚂蝗的呼吸就不似平时那样顺畅，它便浮于水面或上下摆动，这样一来，蚂蝗在雨前生活习性的变动，无形中就起了气象仪的作用。
    会钓鱼的人都善于在阴天或傍晚时下钩，那时鱼常浮于水面，容易上钩，其道理与此相似。
