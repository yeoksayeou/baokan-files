From "Little Kindergarten Director"

Having finished editing the newsletter "Little Kindergarten Director Cui Xiangqin," I was deeply moved.

"As long as there's a need, we will never leave the children." This is an ordinary sentence, but upon deeper reflection, it's quite extraordinary.

Some comrades doing childcare work often don't see the importance of childcare, especially young people, who are even more reluctant to do it. The reasons are nothing more than the following two points: First, children are difficult to manage; second, they think doing this kind of work is not promising.

Children are difficult to manage, but they are not impossible to manage. As long as you understand the psychology of children, and according to their character, patiently guide them, "little naughty ones" will quickly become good children. The newsletter has already written many vivid facts. I won’t say more here.

Whether one has a promising future, and the size of that future, should be measured by the contribution one makes to the country and society, and the size of that contribution. Last year, the rapid development of childcare organizations in urban and rural areas across the country was due to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. Without establishing a large number of childcare organizations, the broad masses of women would not be able to participate in production, and the problem of labor shortage would be difficult to solve. In the future, more and more childcare organizations will be established, and in order to allow mothers to concentrate on production and to cultivate good socialist successors, they must be run well and not badly. This is the glorious responsibility of childcare workers. The country needs a large number of outstanding childcare workers to take on this glorious task. Thus, from the perspective of national needs and contributions to society, doing childcare work is very promising.

"Little Kindergarten Director" Cui Xiangqin and her companions feel that every little progress of the children is their greatest pleasure, and this feeling is an important driving force for consolidating their work enthusiasm. We hope that every childcare worker will approach this noble cause with this kind of sentiment.

### 从“小园长”谈起

    从“小园长”谈起
    编完了“小园长崔香琴”的通讯，很受感动。
    “只要需要，我们一辈子也不离开孩子们。”这是一句普通话，但深思起来，却又那样不普通。
    有一些做保育工作的同志，往往看不到保育工作的重要，特别是年轻的人，更腻歪去做。原因不外以下两点：一、孩子不好看管；二、认为做这种事没有出息。
    孩子难看管，但也不难看管。只要懂得孩子的心理，根据孩子的性格，循循善诱，“小调皮”也会很快变成好孩子。通讯里已经写了很多生动的事实。这里不再多说。
    有没有出息，出息大小，衡量的标准应该是对国家和社会有没有贡献、贡献大小。去年全国城乡托儿组织所以大发展，是因为工农业生产大跃进的需要。不举办大量托儿组织，广大妇女就不能参加生产，劳动力缺乏问题就难解决。在将来，托儿组织还会越办越多，而且为了使妈妈安心生产，为了培养好社会主义的接班人，只能办好不能办坏。这就是保育工作者的光荣责任。国家需要大批优秀的保育工作者担起这项光荣的任务。这样，从国家需要和对社会的贡献来说，做保育工作大有出息。
    “小园长”崔香琴和她的同伴们，对孩子们的每一点进步都感到是自己的极大愉快，这种感情是巩固工作情绪的重要动力。我们希望每一个保育工作者都用这种心情来从事这一崇高的事业。
