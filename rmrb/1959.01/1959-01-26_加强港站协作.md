Strengthening Port-Station Coordination
People's Daily Commentator

The transportation of goods almost always requires the use of two or more modes of transport to complete. Some goods are first transported by truck to the railway station and then shipped out by train; some goods are first transported by train to a seaport and then shipped out by ship; and some goods even need to be collected and distributed by various forms of private transport. Doing a good job of connecting the transfer of goods from one mode of transport to another is an important measure to improve transportation efficiency. If the connection is good, the goods arrive, and the vehicles and ships also arrive, the turnover rate of transportation tools can be greatly improved, and the dwell time of goods at transfer points such as stations and ports can also be greatly shortened. If the connection is not good, either the goods arrive but there are no vehicles or ships, or the vehicles or ships arrive but the goods have not yet arrived, which will inevitably prolong the turnover time of transportation tools and the dwell time of goods at transfer points such as stations and ports.

Doing a good job of connecting the transfer of goods between stations and ports is basically a matter of strengthening cooperation. Although stations and ports belong to two different departments and use two different modes of transport, they share the same task: transportation. The transfer of goods at stations and ports is like passing the baton from one person to the next in a relay race. Here, there should only be a common goal, to run to the finish line quickly, without any delay. Recognizing this consistency and strengthening cooperation, the connection of goods transfer can be done well. Today's news in this newspaper about Jiang'an Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port strengthening cooperation, greatly shortening the dwell time of goods at the transfer point, and improving the turnover efficiency of vehicles and ships, fully proves this point. The cooperation between Jiang'an Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port was not very good in the past, and everyone had a bit of departmentalism. Through the rectification movement, both sides examined their thinking, raised their awareness, and strengthened their cooperation, and quickly changed the face of transportation.

Of course, to do a good job of connecting the transfer of goods between stations and ports, in addition to solving ideological problems and promoting the communist spirit of cooperation, it is also necessary to strengthen planning and organization work and solve some specific problems. However, with the idea of cooperation, specific problems are not difficult to solve. Jiang'an Station and the Third Operations Area of Hankou Port have also created good experiences in this regard. They use the monthly transportation plan as a transshipment plan, strengthen the advance forecast of the arrival of vehicles, ships, and goods, prepare in advance with a clear understanding, make the connection of vehicles and ships closer, and reduce or even avoid blindness and passivity in the work, creating favorable conditions for the work. They also combine the various links of vehicles arriving and ships leaving into a unified technical operation process based on the transshipment plan and the loading and unloading capacity, handling capacity, barges, shunting locomotives, and related equipment capacity of both parties, and signed a contract, and then formulated unified operation indicators based on this unified technical operation process. This eliminates the contradictory phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. In addition, they also implement unified dispatching, unified shifts, leadership meetings, and mass suggestions to solve problems in daily work. This work is done very carefully, which is an important reason why cooperation can achieve practical results. Economic work should be done more and more carefully, and cooperation is a coordinated action between two units, so there must be meticulous arrangements.

In the cooperation between stations and ports, we should also pay attention to gradually increasing loading and unloading equipment and loading and unloading forces, so that it adapts to the transportation tasks.

In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, the cooperative relations between ports and stations across the country have greatly improved. This year, further strengthening station-port cooperation will surely unearth more transportation potential to serve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    加强港站协作
    本报评论员
    货物的运输过程，几乎全部要通过两种以上的运输工具才能完成。有的货物是先由汽车运到铁路车站，再用火车运出去；有的货物是先由火车运到水运港口，再用船舶运出去；还有的货物更需用各种民间运输工具来集散。做好货物从一种运输工具转到另一种运输工具的衔接工作，是提高运输效率的一项重要措施。衔接得好，货到了，车和船也到了，运输工具的周转率能大大提高，货物在车站、港口等转运地点的停留时间也可以大大缩短。衔接得不好，不是货到了，没有车，没有船；就是车或船到了，货还没有来，结果势必延长运输工具的周转时间和货物在车站、港口等转运地点的停留时间。
    做好车站和港口货物转运的衔接工作，基本上是一个加强协作的问题。车站和港口虽然分属两个部门，运用着两种不同的运输工具，却担负着相同的任务：运输。货物在车站和港口转移，好比接力赛跑中的接力棒从上一个人传给下一个人。这里，只有一致的目标，赶快跑到终点，而不应有任何的延误。认识到这种一致性，加强协作，货物转运的衔接工作就能做好。今天本报发表的江岸站和汉口港第三作业区加强协作，大大缩短货物在转运地点的停留时间，提高车船周转效率的新闻，完全证明了这一点，江岸站和汉口港第三作业区过去的协作也不是搞得很好的，大家都有点本位主义。通过整风运动，双方都检查了思想，提高了认识，加强了协作，很快就改变了运输面貌。
    当然，做好车站和港口货物转运的衔接工作，除了解决思想问题，发扬共产主义的协作精神之外，还要加强计划和组织工作，解决一些具体问题。但是，有了协作的思想，具体问题也就不难解决。江岸站和汉口港第三作业区也在这方面创造了良好的经验。他们根据月度运输计划作为换装计划，加强了车、船、货的到达预报，事先作到心中有数，作好准备，使车、船的衔接更加密切，减少以至避免了工作中盲目性和被动情况，给工作创造了有利条件。他们又根据换装计划和双方的装卸力、运搬力、驳船、调车机车和有关设备能力，把车来船去的各个环节组成一个统一的技术作业过程，并签订了合同，然后又根据这个统一的技术作业过程订出了统一的作业指标。这样就消灭了顾此失彼的矛盾现象。此外，他们还实行统一调度、统一班次、领导见面、群众献策等办法，来解决日常工作中的问题。这些工作都作得很细致，是协作能收到实效的重要原因。经济工作要越作越细，协作是两个单位的协同动作，更要有细致的安排。
    在车站和港口的协作中，还要注意逐步增加装卸设备和装卸力量，让它与运输任务相适应。
    几年来，特别是去年的大跃进以来，全国各港口和车站的协作关系有了很大的改进。今年进一步加强站港协作，一定能挖掘出更多的运输潜力来，为更大更好更全面的跃进服务。
