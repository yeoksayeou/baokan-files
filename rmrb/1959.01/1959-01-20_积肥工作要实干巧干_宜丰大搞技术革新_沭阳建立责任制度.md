Accumulate Fertilizer Through Practical and Skillful Work
Yifeng Engages in Technical Innovation, Shuyang Establishes a Responsibility System

According to a report in the Jiangxi Daily, Yifeng County recently mobilized all possible forces to vigorously innovate fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools, forming a massive fertilizer accumulation movement. In just six days, 56 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated and produced, averaging 187.5 dan per mu.

At the end of last month, 30,000 people formed 598 shock teams, using a large number of advanced fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools, which rapidly promoted the fertilizer accumulation movement. More than a thousand and six hundred pieces of advanced fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools were used throughout the county, such as soil cranes, soil trains, hand-pulled fertilizer boxes, chute tractors, ox-drawn flatbed carts, and winches, greatly reducing labor intensity and improving the efficiency of fertilizer accumulation and transportation. The county also organized more than 500 handicraft workers to rush to manufacture and repair various fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools. The masses in various communes created many advanced experiences in accumulating and producing fertilizer, such as fumigating and burning field mud, six-hole fertilizer kilns, and composting soil in the fields. Local chemical fertilizers also blossomed everywhere. A total of 202 local chemical fertilizer plants were built in the county, producing more than 94,000 jin of various local chemical fertilizers.

The progress of fertilizer accumulation and production in Yifeng County was originally not fast enough because many people believed that there were not enough fertilizer sources, so they did not actively explore fertilizer sources; on the other hand, they emphasized that there was insufficient labor. After studying these situations, the county party committee realized that if the fertilizer accumulation work was not grasped tightly, it would seriously affect this year's agricultural production, so it was determined to concentrate the necessary and possible labor force and mobilize some cadres from government offices, teachers and students from schools, and urban residents to participate. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, the county party committee pointed out that "four major grasps" were needed, namely, grasping composting, digging pond mud, burning fire soil ash, and making local chemical fertilizers.

Now, the county party committee is summarizing the experience of this concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign in order to organize several more fertilizer accumulation campaigns and combine regular fertilizer accumulation with concentrated fertilizer accumulation to complete the task of having 600 dan of fertilizer per mu this year.

According to a report in the Xinhua Daily, Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, formed a professional fertilizer accumulation army of 35,000 people, and since the end of autumn planting, it has accumulated 1.04 billion dan of fertilizer.

In order to ensure that crops are well-fed and protected from the cold, each mu of land in the county needs 500 dan of base fertilizer, totaling 5 billion dan of fertilizer. In order to complete this task, the county party committee strengthened its leadership over the fertilizer accumulation front, combining professional fertilizer accumulation with mass fertilizer accumulation, combining year-round fertilizer accumulation with concentrated fertilizer accumulation, and combining the production of local chemical fertilizers with the accumulation of natural fertilizers. At the same time, corresponding rewards and cash purchase methods were adopted. In general, each commune determined that the deputy party secretary would take the lead, the brigade determined that the deputy party secretary and a brigade committee member would be responsible, and the production team determined that the head of the team would be in charge of fertilizer accumulation. Each production team formed professional fertilizer accumulation teams of fifteen to twenty people, which were further divided into livestock fertilizer groups, manure collection groups, and concentrated fertilizer accumulation groups. In each squadron on the water conservancy construction site, a fertilizer management group was established to ensure that no manure was lost. Each commune generally established a "three-fixed and one-reward" (fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed quality, and rewards for exceeding quotas) responsibility system. Team cadres and ordinary commune members were also assigned fertilizer accumulation tasks without affecting production. The quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulation were evaluated in mid-month, and the excess portion was paid for in cash based on quality and price.

Due to the implementation of the above measures, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for accumulating fertilizer has been greatly increased. The people of the county are launching a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement week, determined to complete the task of accumulating 5 billion dan of fertilizer in February. (Attached picture)

    积肥工作要实干巧干
    宜丰大搞技术革新　沭阳建立责任制度
    据江西日报报道　宜丰县最近动员一切可以动员的力量，大搞积肥运肥工具改革，形成了一个声势浩大的积肥运动。仅六天，积肥造肥五千六百万担，每亩平均达一百八十七担半。
    上月底，有三万人组成了五百九十八个突击队，使用了大量先进积肥运肥工具，积肥运动迅速开展。全县使用的积肥运肥先进工具如土起重机、土火车、手拉运肥箱、滑道拖拉机、牛拉大板车、绞车等几十种，共一千六百多件，大大轻减了劳动强度，提高了积肥运肥效率。全县还组织了五百多个手工工人，赶制和修补各种积肥运肥工具。各公社群众创造了许多积肥造肥的先进经验，如熏烧田泥、六孔烧肥窑、田头沤土等。土化肥也百花齐放，全县共建土化肥厂二百零二座，造出各种土化肥九万四千多斤。
    宜丰县的积肥造肥工作原来进度不够快，原因是不少人存在肥源不多的思想，因此没有积极开辟肥源；另方面是强调劳动力不足。县委研究这些情况后，认识到目前积肥工作不抓紧，就会严重影响今年的农业生产，因此决心集中必要的和可能的劳力，并动员一部分机关干部、学校师生、城镇居民参加。在积肥的方法上，县委指出要“四大抓”，即抓沤肥、挖塘泥、烧火土灰和制土化肥。
    现在，县委正在总结这次突击积肥的经验，以便再组织几个积肥战役，并将使经常积肥和突击积肥结合起来，完成今年每亩地有肥六百担。
    据新华日报报道　江苏沭阳县组成了三万五千人的积肥专业大军，从秋种结束以来，已积肥十亿零四百万担。
    为了庄稼吃饱盖暖，全县每亩土地需要基肥五百担，这样共需肥五十亿担。为了完成这个任务，县委加强了积肥战线的领导，使专业积肥和全民积肥结合起来，常年和突击积肥结合起来，制土化肥和积自然肥结合起来，同时还采取了相应的奖励和现金收购的办法。在各公社一般确定了副党委书记挂帅，大队确定副支书和一个大队委员负责，生产队确定正队长管积肥。各生产队组成十五人到二十人的专业积肥队，队里又分成牲畜肥组、拾粪组、突击积肥组；在水利工地上每个中队设立一个管理肥料组，保证不丢掉一泡粪。各公社普遍建立了“三定一奖”（定时、定量、定质、超额奖励）的责任制。队干部和一般社员在不影响生产的前提下，也规定了积肥任务。积肥的数量、质量，每到月中要进行评比，超额部分，按质论价，付给现金。
    由于贯彻了上述措施，大大提高了干部和群众的积肥积极性，全县人民正在开展一个大规模的积肥运动周，决心在2月份完成积肥五十亿担的任务。（附图片）
