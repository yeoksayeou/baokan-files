Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 18th. Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), in his report to the Fourth Session of the Central Committee of the SED, put forward specific proposals for establishing a German Confederation.

In his report entitled "National Rebirth Through a Peace Treaty," Ulbricht pointed out that the ultimate goal of establishing a Confederation is: the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic state, and the Confederation should serve as a transitional solution.

Ulbricht said that the basis for establishing a Confederation is: comprehensive democratization of social and political life in Germany; both German states renounce the production, purchase, or testing of nuclear weapons; the withdrawal of all foreign troops from German territory and, in accordance with the provisions of the peace treaty, the cancellation of foreign military bases on German territory; and both German states withdraw separately from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact Organization, and do not participate in military alliances.

Ulbricht said: A pan-German committee could be established in the Confederation as its highest body. The tasks of this committee are: to conclude a peace treaty, to conclude agreements with foreign countries, to participate in international organizations and international conventions; to adjust relations between the two German states, to abolish conscription in West Germany, to determine the number of armed forces; and to adjust trade, transportation, freight, labor issues, social insurance, cultural issues, and statistical surveys between the two German states.

In his report, Ulbricht also exposed Adenauer's conspiracy to oppose a German peace treaty and to carry out atomic armament, as well as the capitulation policy of the right-wing leadership group of the German Social Democratic Party. He emphasized that the conclusion of the Soviet-proposed peace treaty with Germany would be a barrier to ensuring peace and opposing new wars. Without a peace treaty, Germany will become increasingly divided, while the conclusion of a peace treaty is the beginning of the reunification of the German nation.

    乌布利希在德统一社会党全会上指出
    建立邦联是统一德国的过渡解决办法
    新华社柏林18日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在德国统一社会党中央全会第四次会议上所作的报告中，提出了建立德国邦联的具体建议。
    乌布利希在这篇题为“通过和约达到民族重生”的报告中指出，建立邦联的最终目的是：德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的民主国家，邦联应作为一种过渡的解决办法。
    乌布利希说，建立邦联的基础是：德国社会政治生活全面民主化；两个德国都放弃生产、购买或试验核武器；从德国领土上撤退一切外国军队和按照和约规定，取消在德国领土上的外国军事基地；两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织，并且不参加军事联盟。
    乌布利希说：在邦联中可以建立一个全德委员会，作为它的最高机构。这个委员会的任务是：签订和约，同外国订立协定，参加国际组织和国际公约；调整两个德国之间的关系，取消西德的义务兵役制，确定武装力量的数目；调整两个德国之间的贸易、运输、货运、劳工问题、社会保险、文化问题和统计调查。
    乌布利希在报告中还揭露了阿登纳的反对对德和约和进行原子备战的阴谋，以及德国社会民主党右翼领导集团的投降政策。他着重指出，签订苏联所建议的对德和约将是保证和平和反对新战争的屏障。没有和约，德国将越来越分裂下去，而签订和约则是德国民族重新集合的开始。
