Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 27th: Over 60,000 people in Iraq held a rally at the largest stadium in Baghdad this afternoon to commemorate the anniversary of the 1948 People's Uprising. The conference was organized by the National United Front.

    The conference unanimously adopted a resolution of the National United Front, which declared that it would continue to fight to consolidate the Iraqi Republic and defend its achievements, and to support the leadership of Qasim.

    The conference passed a resolution strongly condemning the aggressive measures of establishing rocket launch sites and nuclear weapons bases in Turkey and Iran to encircle Iraq. The resolution pointed out that these measures threaten the independence of Iraq and endanger world peace.

    The resolution reiterated its support for the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference.

    The resolution said that the Iraqi people are striving to protect Arab unity. They believe that "Arab unity in the struggle against imperialism and Zionism is the right path to Arab unification." The resolution also pledged active support for the Arab people struggling in Algeria, Oman, Aden, and other places, and expressed its determination to hold high the "lofty banner of free Arab nationalism."

    The resolution praised the martyrs of the 1948 uprising and called for maintaining the unity of the internal ranks and consolidating the fraternal relations between the Arab and Kurdish nationalities.

    Iraqi Minister of Agriculture and Acting Minister of Education Humud, Baghdad Mayor Brigadier General Hassan, President of the People's Court Colonel Mahdawi, and Military Prosecutor Colonel Amin and other senior officials attended the conference.

    Ismail, editor-in-chief of "People's Solidarity," spoke at the conference, emphasizing the necessity of close unity of all loyal forces. He said that all Arab people support us. Socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China, as well as peace forces, support us. These two great powers "help us with brotherly and selfless attitude, they are friends of our people and the Arab nation."

    Lawyer and entrepreneur Khadmuri, when talking about drawing lessons from this uprising, said that the Iraqi people are prepared to stop any conspiracy to undermine Iraq's democratic principles.

    The atmosphere at the meeting was warm and the masses were in high spirits. They constantly sang and cheered and shouted slogans. These slogans emphasized the unity of people of all strata and nationalities, consolidating the gains already made, and defending the Republic.

    At the end of 1947, Britain demanded that the old Iraqi regime change the 1930 enslavement treaty into a more aggressive treaty. On January 15, 1948, Britain and Iraq signed a new treaty in Portsmouth. The Iraqi people immediately rose up on January 19 to oppose and demand the abolition of this treaty. This action later developed into the uprising of 1948. Despite the reactionary regime's best efforts to suppress it, under the strong pressure of the people, the Iraqi cabinet at that time finally collapsed on January 27, and this treaty was not ratified.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 27th: Iraqi newspapers and radio stations today published articles, editorials and photographs commemorating the eleventh anniversary of the People's Uprising of 1948.

    Kamel Shadishi, leader of the National Democratic Party, said in an article in "National News," "The direct result of the 1948 uprising and the subsequent 1952 uprising was to raise the people's awareness and unite the various political parties to lead the national movement."

    Shadishi continued, since the Iraqi revolution of 1920, the purpose of every movement of the Iraqi people has been to strive for the happiness and freedom of the Iraqi people. He expressed the hope that the July Revolution will continue until the people obtain their full rights and freedoms.

    Iraqi Republic Radio said in a commentary on January 27 that the Iraqi people's anti-imperialist struggle has been linked to the struggle for democratic freedom and the elimination of imperialist control in the Arab East. The Iraqi people have repeatedly proved to the world that they are strong and indomitable in the common struggle of the Arabs.

    The radio station said that the Iraqi people understand that every national demand can only be realized in the fiery anti-imperialist struggle and the bloody struggle for democracy.

    纪念一九四八年人民起义日
    巴格达六万群众举行集会
    宣布决心保卫共和国支持卡塞姆
    新华社巴格达27日电　伊拉克六万余群众今天下午在巴格达最大的运动场举行集会，纪念1948年人民起义的周年纪念日。这次大会是由民族统一阵线组织的。
    大会一致通过民族统一阵线的一项决议，决议宣布将继续为巩固伊拉克共和国和保卫它的成就而斗争，并且支持卡塞姆的领导。
    大会通过决议强烈谴责在土耳其和伊朗建立火箭发射场和核武器基地来包围伊拉克的侵略措施。决议指出，这些措施威胁着伊拉克的独立并且危害世界和平。
    决议重申对万隆会议和亚非人民团结大会的各项决议的支持。
    决议说，伊拉克人民努力保护阿拉伯的团结。他们认为，“阿拉伯人在反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争中的团结是走向阿拉伯统一的正确道路”。决议还保证积极支持阿尔及利亚、阿曼和亚丁等地正在斗争的阿拉伯人民，并且表示要高举“自由的阿拉伯民族主义的崇高旗帜”。
    决议对1948年起义的烈士表示赞扬，并且号召保持内部队伍的团结以及巩固阿拉伯族和库尔德族的兄弟关系。
    伊拉克农业部长兼代理教育部长胡穆德、巴格达市长哈桑准将、人民法庭庭长马赫达维上校和军事检察长阿明上校等高级官员都出席了大会。
    “人民团结报”主编伊斯梅尔在大会上发言，强调所有忠诚的力量紧密团结的必要性。他说，所有的阿拉伯人民都支持我们。苏联和中国等社会主义国家以及和平力量都支持我们。这两个大国“以兄弟般的和无私的态度帮助我们，它们是我国人民和阿拉伯民族的朋友”。
    律师和企业家哈德穆里在谈到从这次起义中汲取教训时说，伊拉克人民准备制止任何破坏伊拉克的民主准则的阴谋。
    会场气氛热烈，群众情绪高昂。他们不断地唱歌和欢呼并高呼口号。这些口号强调各阶层人民和各民族团结一致，巩固已获得的成果，保卫共和国。
    在1947年底，英国要求伊拉克旧政权把1930年的奴役条约改成为更富有侵略性的条约。1948年1月15日，英国和伊拉克在朴次茅斯签订了新条约。伊拉克人民立即在1月19日起来反对并且要求废除这项条约。这一行动后来就发展成为1948年的起义。尽管当时的反动政权竭力镇压，但是在人民的强大压力下，伊拉克当时的内阁在1月27日终于垮了台，这个条约未被批准。
    新华社巴格达27日电　伊拉克报纸和电台今天发表文章、社论和刊载照片纪念1948年人民起义第十一周年。
    国家民主党领袖卡迈勒·沙迪希在“国民报”上发表文章说，“1948年起义以及后来的1952年起义的直接结果是提高了人民的觉悟，并且使各政党团结起来领导了民族运动。”
    沙迪希接着说，自从伊拉克1920年革命以来，伊拉克人民历次运动的目的都是为了争取伊拉克人民的幸福和自由。他表示希望七月革命继续进行下去，直到人民获得他们的充分权利和自由。
    伊拉克共和国电台27日发表评论说，伊拉克人民的反帝斗争，已经和争取民主自由和消除帝国主义在阿拉伯东方的控制的斗争联系了起来。伊拉克人民向全世界一再证明，他们在阿拉伯人的共同斗争中是坚强的和不屈不挠的。
    电台说，伊拉克人民懂得，每一个民族要求只能在烈火般的反帝斗争中和争取民主的流血斗争中得到实现。
