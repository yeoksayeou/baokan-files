Qinghai Has Many Specialties

	Qinghai Horse
	Legend has it that there is a Heart of the Lake Mountain in Qinghai Lake. Placing a mare on it can produce "dragon seed." The ancient Tuyuhun people once put Persian grass horses there, resulting in a piebald colt that could travel a thousand miles a day, known as the Qinghai Cong. Emperor Yang of Sui placed horses there to graze in order to obtain "dragon seed." Although these are near-mythical legends, Qinghai has been famous for its horses since ancient times.
	Qinghai Province has more than 350,000 horses, which can be roughly divided into four types according to their body shape and performance: Hequ horse, Datong horse, Yushu horse, and Qaidam horse. Among them, the Hequ horse is the best, and the Datong horse is the most numerous.
	The Hequ horse is named after its distribution in the Hequ area of the Yellow River at the junction of Gansu and Qinghai. It is one of the three famous breeds in the country, along with the Ili horse and the Mongolian horse. This horse is tall, long-waisted, long-eared, and large-hoofed, and quite majestic. It is highly adaptable and can be used for both riding and draught. It can pull 500 kilograms and travel 50 kilometers a day. If used for riding, it can gallop quickly and for a long time.
	The Datong horse, also known as the Menyuan horse, is distributed in the Qilian Mountains. Although this horse is smaller in size and draught power than the Hequ horse, and has less endurance, it is stable, easy to walk, flexible to control, good at walking mountain roads, and resistant to cold, making it a very good riding horse.

	Xining Wool
	The wool produced in Qinghai Province is collectively referred to as Xining wool, and is known as the "King of Wool" in domestic and foreign markets. This wool has coarse and long fibers, is rich in elasticity and toughness, is wear-resistant and durable, and has bright color, making it the best raw material for weaving carpets and various blankets.
	Qinghai Province ranks third in the country in wool production, second only to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. Last year, wool production increased by nearly 100% compared with 1952. In order to further meet the needs of China's wool textile industry for fine wool raw materials, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Animal Husbandry has been using Xinjiang sheep and local ewes for crossbreeding since 1952, preparing to gradually improve the local Tibetan sheep into fine wool sheep for both wool and meat.

	Xining Rhubarb
	In the vast Qinghai Province, especially in the two Tibetan autonomous prefectures of Guoluo and Hainan, a precious medicine called "Jinmu" in Tibetan grows everywhere, which is the "Xining Rhubarb" famous at home and abroad. Rhubarb is a good medicine for clearing heat, promoting瀉下，strengthening the stomach, and sterilizing, and can also be used as an industrial pigment raw material. Because the rhubarb in Qinghai Province is all gathered in Xining for processing and transportation, it is called "Xining Rhubarb".
	Xining Rhubarb ranks first in the country in terms of output and quality.

	Cordyceps
	Cordyceps is a strange medicinal material. In winter, it resembles a silkworm hibernating underground. When spring arrives, before the worm awakens, a kind of fungus quietly parasitizes the worm's body, growing seedlings by borrowing the worm's nutrition, and the stiff worm still maintains its complete form. Therefore, farmers and herdsmen in Qinghai call it "Winter Worm Summer Grass."
	Cordyceps is a tonic and strengthening medicine, mostly exported to various parts of Southeast Asia. The high mountains of the two Tibetan autonomous prefectures of Guoluo and Yushu in Qinghai Province have abundant reserves.

    青海特产多
    青海马
    青海湖中有个海心山，相传置牝马于其上，可得“龙种”。古吐谷浑曾将波斯草马放入其中，因得骢驹，能日行千里，被称做青海骢。隋炀帝为得“龙种”，曾置马在此放牧。这虽然是一些近乎神话的传说，但青海出名马，却是自古就闻名的了。
    青海省有马三十五万多匹，按其体形和性能来说，约可分为河曲马、大通马、玉树马和柴达木马四种，其中以河曲马为最好，大通马数量最多。
    河曲马因分布在甘、青交界处的黄河河曲地带而得名，与伊犁马、蒙古马同为全国三大名种之一。这种马身躯高大，腰长窎，耳长，蹄大，颇为雄壮。适应性强。可乘挽兼用。挽五百公斤，日行可达五十公里；如供乘骑，疾驰持久。
    大通马又名亹源马，分布在祁连山区。这种马虽然体型、挽力比河曲马小，持久力差，但由于稳健、善走，灵活易驭，善走山路，耐寒力强，是很好的乘用马。
    西宁毛
    青海省出产的羊毛被统称为西宁毛，在国内外市场上有“毛中之王”的称誉。这种毛纤维粗长，富于弹性和韧性，抗磨耐用，色泽鲜润，是织造地毯和各种毛毯的最好原料。
    青海省的羊毛产量仅次于新疆、内蒙古而居全国第三位，去年羊毛产量就比1952年提高了近一倍。为了进一步满足我国毛纺工业对于细呢原料的需要，青海省畜牧厅从1952年起，就开始用新疆羊和当地土种母羊进行杂交，准备逐步把这里的藏系羊改良为毛肉兼用的细毛羊。
    西宁大黄
    在辽阔的青海省，特别是在果洛和海南两个藏族自治州境内，遍地生长着一种藏语称为“金木”的名贵药，这就是驰名国内外的“西宁大黄”。大黄是一种去热、利泻、健胃和杀菌的良药，并可以作工业色素原料。由于青海省的大黄都汇集在西宁加工外运，所以被称为“西宁大黄”。
    西宁大黄的产量和质量都居全国第一。
    冬虫草
    冬虫草是一种奇异的药材。冬天，形似家蚕在地下冬眠；当春季到来，这条虫子还没有苏醒的时候，一种菌胞悄悄地寄生在虫体，借着虫体的营养成长出苗，僵死的虫子仍然保持着完整的形态。因此，青海的农牧民都称它为“冬虫夏草”。
    冬虫草是一种滋补、强壮用药，大多数出口销向南洋各地。青海省果洛、玉树两个藏族自治州的高山上有着丰富的藏量。
