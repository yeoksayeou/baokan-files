Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The people of the capital express great concern and support for the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism and for national independence. They resolutely condemn the US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' crimes of suppressing the Congolese people's independence struggle.

Today, many factories, enterprises, and suburban people's communes held discussion meetings. At a forum held at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, fitter Ren Chenggang said: "The Cuban people's overthrow of the Batista regime is a very gratifying event. Although Cuba and the Congo are far from us, their heroic struggles arouse great sympathy and concern among our Chinese steel workers." Li Shusen, an engineer from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and a deputy to the National People's Congress, said that he was very excited to see news in the newspaper about the victory of the national independence movements of the Cuban and Congolese people. If the imperialists do not stop their shameless intervention, they will surely be smashed to pieces. At discussion meetings held at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, people unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people.

Cadres of the capital's government offices, teachers and students of universities and colleges are constantly concerned about the national independence struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. People rush to read the relevant news in the newspapers every day. They congratulate the Cuban people on overthrowing the dictatorial government that had been riding on their heads for many years, and express great sympathy for the Congolese people's struggle for freedom. Teachers and students from the civil engineering, radio, mechanical, and power departments of Tsinghua University held discussion meetings to condemn the US imperialism and Belgian colonialists' interference and suppression of the Cuban and Congolese people. Jin Xiwu, deputy director of the Mechanical Engineering Department, Yang Shide, deputy director of the Civil Engineering Department, and others pointed out at the discussion meetings that the US imperialism's efforts to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and protect Batista and his reactionary partners show that it is the most ferocious enemy of the Latin American people. With the support of just people all over the world, the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people will surely achieve final victory.

In recent days, Beijing newspapers have received many letters from readers expressing their firm support for the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. Readers expressed great anger at the crimes of US imperialism and Belgian colonialists in their letters. (Attached pictures)
