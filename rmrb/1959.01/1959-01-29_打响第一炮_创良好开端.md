    Fire the First Shot, Create a Good Start

    Editor's Note: This is an editorial published in Yunnan Daily. It is a collective creation of four comrades from the Southwest Instrument Factory: workers and technicians Wu Wencuan, Yang Youfa, Luo Shenghe, and Ying Guichu. They use their own personal experiences as workers to discuss the principle of "firing the first shot and creating a good start."

    This year is the decisive year of the three-year hard struggle. The Party has issued a battle call to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The production tasks of many factories have increased several times compared to last year, and various new products need to be trial-produced. This task is arduous, but also glorious. We workers have the confidence and determination to complete the various production tasks assigned by the Party this year, and we must make outstanding contributions.

    Since this year's production will have a greater leap forward than last year, based on last year's experience, we must start the year by vigorously promoting production. We must not have the mentality that "if we don't complete the plan in January, we can catch up in February." We must focus on the beginning of the month, not the end; we must focus on the beginning of the year, not the end. Only in this way can we ensure both the completion of production tasks and avoid quality and safety accidents due to rushing tasks.

    To vigorously promote production, the leaders of each factory must first become more energetic, especially in arranging plans well. Although some factories cannot decide on the full-year plan for the time being, they should arrange the first quarter's plan as soon as possible so that the workers have a clear goal to strive for. Plans guide production. If plans are not arranged in time and there is no direction, production and thinking cannot become energetic. Last year, the plans in some workshops of the Southwest Instrument Factory were arranged slowly, the tasks were not very clear, and materials were not supplied in time. As a result, the beginning of the month was relaxed, and they only started rushing tasks around the 20th. Consequently, the workers' enthusiasm and production were affected. This year, the Southwest Instrument Factory has learned from last year's experience. Each workshop started discussing plans in December of last year, and by the beginning of January this year, all plans had been arranged. At the beginning of the year, the workers were able to engage in production vigorously. This ensures both the completion of tasks and the guarantee of quality and safety. Workshops and offices must also do a good job in production preparation: drawings, materials, tools, labor organization adjustments, etc. If preparation work is not done well, workers will be looking for this and that, lacking this and that, resulting in only five or six hours of actual work during the eight-hour shift. If preparation work is done well, workers can work a full eight hours after starting work and can accomplish more. In this way, the rhythm of work and rest is adjusted, and production tasks are completed. Cadres participating in labor and sharing weal and woe with workers should continue. This can further encourage the workers' enthusiasm. Last year, cadres of the Southwest Instrument Factory rarely went to the chrome plating section. The workers said that our section was a remote part of the factory and had opinions. Later, with the implementation of "two participations and one reform," cadres often went to the section, problems in production could be resolved in a timely manner, and the workers worked even more enthusiastically. Recently, the workers in the first workshop voluntarily carried out voluntary labor, and all the cadres of the workshop also participated, which greatly encouraged the workers. This style should continue to be promoted, so that the workers' enthusiasm will definitely be greater, and the monthly completion of tasks will be guaranteed.

    What about us workers ourselves? We must stir up soaring energy. Because we directly shoulder the production tasks, and we directly participate in production management, we have a major responsibility for the success or failure of the task completion. We must continue to boost our energy, strive for the upper reaches, work hard and diligently, launch socialist competitions, and ensure the outstanding completion of production tasks. The Party instructed us to adjust the rhythm of work and rest, which is the Party's cordial care for us. Then, we must work practically, work hard, and work cleverly, carry out technological innovation, and complete the leap forward plan in a greater, better, and more comprehensive way. We must understand that only with the spirit of hard work can we find clever ways to work. The vigorous technological innovation movement of the past year was precisely generated under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. Without the spirit of hard work, it would be impossible to come up with clever ways to work. Of course, clever work will further encourage the spirit of hard work, so hard work and clever work must be well combined.

    To complete this year's larger production tasks, we need to overcome many difficulties. Judging from the situation of some factories, the first is insufficient technical strength. New workers must quickly master production techniques and adapt to the needs of production development. The method adopted by the Southwest Instrument Factory is to first help new workers master the basic principles of production, and then help them quickly produce independently, learning by doing, studying production during the day and studying theory at night, accelerating the improvement of their production technical level. At the same time, we must continue to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, boldly innovate technology, vigorously develop indigenous methods and equipment, and rely on our own efforts to solve the difficulties of insufficient and unbalanced equipment; we must also fully tap the potential of equipment and labor. With the help and participation of the leadership, workers must also closely integrate with engineering and technical personnel, learn from friendly factories, master new technologies, and ensure the continuous improvement of product quality. In addition, we must also pay attention to saving raw materials and continuously reducing costs. For example, adopt forging die modularization to reduce machining allowance and save materials, and strive to ensure that no defective products are produced when machining parts, so as to avoid waste of every bit. We believe that as long as we continue to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results under the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to overcome various difficulties, complete this year's industrial production tasks, and win a great victory in January.

### 打响第一炮  创良好开端

    打响第一炮  创良好开端
    编者按：这是云南日报发表的一篇社论。它是西南仪器厂工人和技师吴文全、杨友发、罗盛和、应桂初四个同志的集体创作。他们用工人自己的切身体会论述了“打响第一炮，创良好开端”的道理。
    今年，是苦战三年决定性的一年，党已经发出了争取更大、更好、更全面跃进的战斗号召。许多工厂的生产任务比去年成倍地增加了，而且要试制各种新产品。这个任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。我们工人有信心有决心完成今年党交给的各项生产任务，而且一定要做出出色的贡献。
    今年的生产既然比去年有更大的跃进，根据去年的经验，一开年就要紧张地把生产搞起来，不能有“一月完不成计划还有二月再来赶”的打算。要紧在月头，不要紧在月尾；要紧在年头，不要紧在年尾。只有这样，才能既保证完成生产任务，又不致于因为赶任务发生质量安全事故。
    要把生产紧张地搞起来，首先从各厂的领导人就要紧张起来，特别是要把计划安排好。有些厂子虽然一时决定不了全年的计划，但是要把一季度的计划趁早安排下来，这样，工人才有个明确的奋斗目标。计划是指导生产的，不及时安排计划，没有个方向，生产和思想都无法紧张起来。去年，西南仪器厂有的车间计划安排得迟缓，任务不十分明确，材料也供应不上，所以月初很松，到了二十几号才来赶任务。结果，工人的积极性和生产都受到了影响。今年，西南仪器厂接受了去年的经验，各车间从去年12月起就开始讨论计划，今年1月初，就都把计划安排下去了。一开年，工人们就能紧张地投入生产。这样，既能保证完成任务，又能保证质量和安全。车间和科室也必须做好生产准备工作：图纸、材料、工具、劳动组织的调整等等都要做好。要是准备工作做不好，工人一上班又找这样、又找那样，又缺这样、又缺那样，结果，上班八小时，实际只能干五、六小时的活；如果准备工作做好了，工人们上班后，能足足地干八小时，就可以做出更多的活来。这样，劳逸节奏也调节了，生产任务也完成了。干部参加劳动，与工人同甘共苦，都应该坚持下去。这样，能够更加鼓舞工人们的劲头。去年，西南仪器厂干部很少到镀铬工段去，工人们说我们工段是厂里偏僻的地方，有意见；后来，实行两参一改，干部常到工段去了，生产中的问题能够及时解决，工人们劳动得也就更有劲。最近第一车间工人们自动地进行义务劳动，车间的全体干部也都参加了，对工人鼓舞很大，这种作风要继续发扬，这样，肯定工人的干劲会更大，一定会保证月月完成任务。
    我们工人自己呢？更要鼓起冲天的干劲。因为生产任务是由我们直接挑着，而且我们又直接参加生产管理，任务完成的好坏，我们有重大的责任。我们要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，苦干苦钻，开展社会主义竞赛，保证出色地完成生产任务。党指示我们要调整劳逸节奏，这是党对我们的亲切关怀。那么，我们就更要实干、苦干加巧干，开展技术革新，更大、更好、更全面地完成跃进计划。要明白，只有有了苦干的劲头，才会找出巧干的办法来。去年一年轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，正是在大跃进的形势下产生的。如果没有苦干的劲头，也就不可能想得出巧干的办法。当然，巧干会进一步鼓舞苦干的劲头，因此必须把苦干与巧干很好结合起来。
    要完成今年更大的生产任务，需要我们克服许多困难。从一些厂的情况来看，首先是技术力量不够。必须让新工人很快地掌握生产技术，适应生产发展的需要。西南仪器厂采取的办法是，首先帮助新工人掌握生产的基本原理，然后帮助他们很快地单独生产，边做边学，白天学生产，晚上学理论，加速提高他们的生产技术水平。同时，还要继续发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，大胆革新技术，大搞土洋设备，自力更生，来解决设备不足和不平衡的困难；还要充分挖掘设备和劳动的潜力。在领导的帮助和参加下，工人还要与工程技术人员密切结合，向友厂学习，掌握新技术，保证不断地提高产品质量。此外，还要注意节约原材料，不断地降低成本。如采取锻件胎模化，以便减少加工余量、节约用料，加工零件尽量保证不出废品，做到一点一滴不浪费等。我们相信，只要在党的领导下，继续贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，我们就一定能够战胜各种困难，完成今年的工业生产任务，并在1月份就打一个大胜仗。
