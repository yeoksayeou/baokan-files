    Pigskin Leather Manufacturing: Value Multiplied a Hundredfold
    (Our report) In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the leather industry, like other industries, has experienced rapid development. Last year, the output of light leather (for light industry) and heavy leather (for heavy industry) is expected to increase by 40.8% compared to 1957, and the output of leather shoes will increase by 30.2%.
    Given the need to protect draught cattle and develop agricultural production, the source of cowhide is limited. In order to develop the leather industry, the use of pigskin for leather making has been vigorously promoted in recent years. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the total utilization of pigskin reached more than 4.7 million pieces. After last year's bumper agricultural harvest, pig breeding increased rapidly. Many regions, such as Henan, Shaanxi, and Fujian, have begun to skin pigs. According to statistics, by the end of the year, it is expected to reach more than 4.22 million pieces, equivalent to 88.5% of the total amount during the first Five-Year Plan period.
    Last year, the employees of the leather industry put forward a large number of technical innovation proposals, among which 32 were of high value and worthy of promotion nationwide. At the same time, the quality of several major products has reached international standards.
    In terms of pigskin leather production technology, a relatively mature set of experiences has been mastered. To beautify pigskin leather, the coarse-grained and rough-surfaced pigskin can be made fine and smooth. Pigskin can be made into textile leather rollers that can spin 60-count yarn, with performance no less than that of cowhide. Zhang Deyuan of the Chengdu slaughterhouse also created a skinning machine. Using this machine to skin a pig takes only ten seconds per pig, increasing efficiency thirty times compared to the fastest manual skinning speed. The skinned pigskin has no knife marks and does not include the mammary gland part of the abdomen, which improves the useful area and quality of the leather making.
    Because pigskin is available throughout the country, since the people's communes have been vigorously developing industry, new leather and shoe factories have been established in places such as the Zhangjiawan People's Commune in Beijing and the Dengta People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, to utilize local pigskin resources and meet the needs of commune members for shoes.

    猪皮制革  身价百倍
    本报讯　在工农业生产大跃进中，皮革工业和其他工业一样，已经有了飞跃的发展。去年轻革（轻工业用革）重革（重工业用革）产量预计将比1957年增加40.8％，皮鞋产量将增加30.2％。
    在保护耕牛，发展农业生产的情况下，牛皮来源有一定的限度。为了发展皮革工业，近几年来，大力利用猪皮制革。在第一个五年计划期间，猪皮利用总量已达四百七十多万张。去年农业大丰收后，猪的繁殖很快，很多地区如河南、陕西、福建等地，都已开始剥猪皮，据统计，到年底，预计可达四百二十多万张，相当于第一个五年计划期间总量的88.5％。
    去年皮革工业的职工们，提出了大量的技术革新建议，其中价值较高、值得在全国范围内推广的就有三十二件。同时已经有几种主要产品质量达到了国际水平。
    在猪皮制革的生产技术上，已经掌握了一套比较成熟的经验，为美化猪皮革，可以把粗纹麻面的猪皮变得细致平整，使猪皮制成纺织用皮辊革，能纺六十支纱，性能不次于牛皮。成都市屠宰场张德元还创制了剥皮机，用这种机器剥皮，每剥一头猪的皮，只需十秒钟，比最快的手工剥皮速度提高效率三十倍。剥下的猪皮无刀伤，不带腹部乳头部分，提高了制革的有用面积和质量。
    由于猪皮全国各地都有，在人民公社大办工业以来，北京张家湾人民公社、山东省高唐县灯塔人民公社等地，都已经建立起新的制革制鞋厂，就地利用猪皮资源，满足社员穿鞋需要。
