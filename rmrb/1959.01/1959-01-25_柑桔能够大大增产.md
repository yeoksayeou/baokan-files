Citrus Fruits Can Greatly Increase Production
Wang He

Great achievements were made in citrus production in 1958. It is estimated that the national citrus output will increase from 6.43 million dan in 1957 to about 8 million dan, an increase of 24%; the citrus cultivation area has also expanded by more than 600,000 mu. This growth rate exceeded any year in history, but it still cannot meet the growing huge needs of our people. Facing 1959, a year of greater and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, citrus production must also have a greater development. At last year's national citrus on-site conference, many southern provinces proposed to double citrus production in 1959, which is achievable. In 1958, we have created rich experience in increasing citrus production. Due to breaking superstition, emancipating the mind, and strengthening cultivation management, many high-yield citrus orchards have emerged in various places, powerfully criticizing the conservative ideas that citrus production cannot break the large and small year cycle and that the increase in production of perennial fruit trees in the current year is limited. Many fruit farmers have deeply realized that as long as the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is earnestly implemented in cultivation and management techniques, the old rules of large and small years can be broken, so that citrus can increase production year after year; the newly built orchards can blossom and bear fruit faster, and the original old fruit trees can have deep roots and lush foliage, rejuvenate, and greatly increase production. Therefore, whether this year's citrus can greatly increase production depends on whether various management measures can keep up in time. In spring, it is necessary to seize the time to accumulate fertilizer, make fertilizer, clean up the citrus orchards, prepare medicine and machinery, and carry out fertilization, pest control, and pruning in a timely manner; in the northern regions, it is necessary to continue to do a good job in cold protection.

Cultivating large-scale high-yield citrus orchards is an important guarantee for realizing a great leap forward in citrus production, but at the same time, it is also necessary to transform low-yield citrus orchards well, and turn most of the low-yield orchards into high-yield orchards, in order to greatly increase the total national citrus output. As far as the whole country is concerned, our existing citrus cultivation area cannot meet the needs, and every existing citrus tree is very precious, and we must make great efforts to manage it well. However, at present, in every citrus producing area, there are high-yield orchards and low-yield orchards, and in the same orchard, there are also high-yield trees and low-yield trees with very different yields. Every citrus tree is not born high-yield or low-yield, the main thing is artificial cultivation. As long as efforts are made in cultivation, every low-yield tree can become a high-yield tree. This also shows that as long as various places take some fundamental measures, prescribe the right medicine, transform backward orchards, and eliminate low-yield trees, the existing citrus trees still have great production potential to be tapped.

To develop citrus production, from a long-term perspective, it is also necessary to actively expand the cultivation area. This year, many provinces have plans to cultivate citrus, and the current central issue is to quickly solve the source of citrus seedlings. The method is to rely on the masses and rely on our own efforts. The reason why the citrus area had a relatively rapid increase in 1958 was mainly due to the establishment of the principle of relying on the masses and relying on our own efforts in seedling cultivation; the combination of mass seedling cultivation and state-owned seedling cultivation, and the simultaneous advancement of four seedling cultivation methods: grafting, layering, cutting, and seedling. Where this was done, the citrus area was significantly expanded. The Shaoyang City Horticultural Farm in Hunan Province, due to relying on and mobilizing employees, carried out technical revolution in seedling cultivation, and created the "one" shaped budding method, which increased efficiency by an average of two or three times, with the highest one grafting 3,303 plants a day, and the survival rate reaching 90%.

In order to meet the needs of various places to develop citrus production in large quantities, the people's communes in citrus producing areas should establish citrus nurseries, and carry out "self-selection, self-collection, self-cultivation, self-planting", and the communes can adjust each other. To establish a nursery, we must now try every means to collect various citrus seeds, and many areas have launched a mass movement of "eating oranges and donating seeds", which has achieved good results. If the seedling work is done well, in one or two years, the citrus cultivation area can be greatly expanded.

    柑桔能够大大增产
    王贺
    1958年柑桔生产取得了很大成绩。估计全国柑桔产量将由1957年的六百四十三万担增加到八百万担左右，提高了24％；柑桔栽培面积也扩大了六十余万亩。这种增长速度超过了历史上任何一年，但还不能满足我国人民日益增长的巨大需要。面临着农业生产更大更全面跃进的1959年，柑桔生产也必须有一个更大的发展。在去年的全国柑桔现场会议上，南方许多省都提出要在1959年把柑桔产量增加一倍，这个任务是可以实现的。1958年在柑桔增产方面，我们已经创造了丰富的经验。由于破除迷信，解放思想，加强了培养管理，各地出现了许多高产柑桔园，有力地批判了柑桔生产大小年不可打破和多年生果树当年增产有限等保守思想。许多果农都已经深切体会到，只要在栽培管理技术上认真贯彻农业八字宪法，就可以打破大、小年之分的老规矩，使柑桔连年增产；就可以使新建的果园更快地开花结果，使原有的老果树根深叶茂，由老还童，产量大增。所以，今年的柑桔能否大大增产，关键在于各种管理措施能否及时跟上。在春季来说，就是要抓紧积肥、造肥、清理桔园，准备药械，及时进行施肥、除虫、修剪；北部地区目前还要继续作好防寒工作。
    培养大面积高产柑桔园是实现柑桔生产大跃进的一个重要保证，但同时也必须很好地改造低产柑桔园，把大部分的低产园变成高产园，才能大大提高全国柑桔的总产量。就全国来说，我们柑桔的现有栽培面积还不能满足需要，现有的每一棵柑桔树都是十分宝贵的，都要下大力把它管理好。但是，目前在每一个柑桔产区，都有高产园和低产园，在同一个果园里，也有产量相差很大的高产树和低产树。每一棵柑桔树，并非生来就是高产或是低产的，主要的还是在于人工的培育。只要在培育上下功夫，每一棵低产树都可以变成高产树。这也说明：只要各地采取一些根本措施，对症下药，改造落后园，消灭低产树，现有的柑桔树还有很大的生产潜力可以挖掘。
    发展柑桔生产，从长远打算，还必须积极扩大栽培面积。今年许多省都有了栽培柑桔的计划，当前的中心问题是迅速解决柑桔苗木的来源。办法是依靠群众，自力更生。1958年柑桔面积所以有了较快的增长，主要就是确立了依靠群众、自力更生的育苗原则；群众育苗和国营育苗相结合，嫁接、压条、扦插、实生四种育苗方法齐头并进。那里这样作了，那里柑桔的面积就显著扩大。湖南邵阳市园艺场由于依靠和发动职工，在育苗方面实行技术革命，创造了“一”字形芽接法，效率平均提高了二、三倍，最高的一人一天嫁接三千三百零三株，成活效率达90％。
    为了满足各地大量发展柑桔生产的需要，柑桔产区的人民公社应建立柑桔苗圃，进行“自选、自采、自育、自栽”，公社之间可以互相调剂。要建立苗圃，当前就要想尽一切办法把各种柑桔种子搜集起来，不少地区展开了“吃桔献种”的群众运动，已经收到良好效果。育苗工作作好了，一两年后，柑桔的栽培面积就可大大扩大。
