Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 1st: T. Surenjav, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia, published an article in the Mongolian newspaper "Unen" today, discussing the development indicators of Mongolia's national economy in 1959.

The article stated that 1959 marks the second year of Mongolia's Three-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture. One of the main tasks this year is to further develop the agricultural and pastoral collectivization movement, consolidate agricultural and pastoral cooperatives organizationally and economically, and increase the income of the cooperatives.

Reviewing the situation in 1958, the article said that the national herdsmen launched a high tide of the collectivization movement this year, making the number of herdsmen households joining the cooperative reach 56%. The vast number of herdsmen have proved the superiority of collectivization in practice.

The article pointed out that the livestock breeding target for 1959 is 3.3%, bringing the total number of livestock to 24.2 million. In this way, the national plan to develop 25 million livestock by 1960 can be realized. The lambing season is approaching, and ensuring the survival of young animals without loss is the glorious task of the herding masses.

In agriculture, the cultivated area in 1959 will be expanded by 23.6% compared with last year, and grain output will increase by 21.3%. Members of pastoral cooperatives with the necessary conditions should engage in agriculture while increasing livestock. State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should also expand their cultivated area.

The article pointed out when discussing the development of industry, that the shoe factory and leather factory of the Industrial United Factory will be expanded this year. The newly built paper mill and prefabricated wood structure housing factory will be completed this year. This year, a campaign to increase the output of industrial products and improve product quality should be launched. Attention should also be paid to expanding and improving transportation, postal and telecommunications work, and the speed of capital construction should be accelerated.

The article stated that relying on the soaring enthusiasm, wisdom, and creativity of the working class and all working people, and with the assistance and economic cooperation of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, we are fully capable of completing the annual construction tasks ahead of schedule this year.

    苏伦扎布著文谈今年经济发展指标
    新华社乌兰巴托1日电　蒙古部长会议第一副主席苏伦扎布今天在蒙古“真理报”上发表文章，谈蒙古1959年国民经济的发展指标。
    文章说，1959年蒙古进入发展国民经济和文化的三年计划的第二年。这一年主要任务之一是进一步开展农牧业合作化运动，使农牧业合作社在组织上、经济上得到巩固，并且增加合作社的收入。
    文章回顾1958年的情况时说，这一年全国牧民掀起了合作化运动的高潮，使得入社牧户达到56％。广大牧民在实践中证实了合作化的优越性。
    文章指出，1959年的牲畜增殖指标为3.3％，使牲畜总头数达到二千四百二十万头。这样，到1960年就能实现全国发展到二千五百万头牲畜的计划。目前牲畜接羔期已经临近，保证幼畜成活无损，是牧民群众的光荣任务。
    在农业方面，1959年的耕地面积将比去年扩大23.6％，粮食产量将增加21.3％，凡是有条件的牧户合作社社员，在增加牲畜的同时，应经营农业。国营农牧场也要扩大耕地面积。
    文章谈到工业发展的情况时指出，今年将扩建工业联合工厂的制鞋厂、皮革厂。新建的造纸厂和木结构房屋预制厂将在今年建成。今年要开展一个提高工业产品产量、改进产品质量的运动。还要注意扩大和改进交通邮电工作，要求加快基本建设的速度。
    文章说，依靠热情高涨的工人阶级和全体劳动人民的智慧和创造性，在苏联、中国和社会主义各国的援助及经济合作之下，今年我们完全有条件提前完成全年的建设任务。（附图片）
