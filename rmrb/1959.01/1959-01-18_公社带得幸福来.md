The spring breeze blows, a hundred flowers bloom
The commune brings happiness
Everyone joyfully enters the commune
Flowers of happiness bloom everywhere
Every bird loves the green mountains
Every sunflower faces the sun
The people's commune is beloved by everyone
Like a child loves its mother
Every river flows eastward
Everyone walks the path of happiness
The people's commune has been established
Poverty is gone forever
