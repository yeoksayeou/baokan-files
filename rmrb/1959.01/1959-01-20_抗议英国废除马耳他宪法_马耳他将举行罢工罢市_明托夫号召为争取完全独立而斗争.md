Xinhua News Agency, Valletta, January 19th: Maltese Labour Party leader Mintoff called on all Maltese residents at a public rally on the 18th to hold a 24-hour strike and business closure after the British House of Commons passed the abolition of the Maltese Constitution, and to designate this day as a national day of mourning.
    The abolition of the Maltese Constitution is a measure by Britain to suppress the Maltese people. After negotiations between Britain and the Maltese political parties' delegations broke down due to Britain's refusal to grant Malta independence, Britain announced at the beginning of this month the abolition of the constitution that recognized certain autonomous rights for the residents of Malta, and the direct rule of Malta by the British Governor. The British government has requested the House of Commons to pass its bill on the abolition of the Maltese Constitution when it reconvenes later this month.
    Mintoff called on the residents of Malta to regard this strike and business closure as a symbol of the Maltese residents' protest against British policy, saying, "We should express our feelings with action rather than just words. We demand complete independence; this is the greatest struggle for the residents of Malta."
    Mintoff demanded that the residents of Malta boycott institutions and ceremonies organized by the British or participated in by the British.

    抗议英国废除马耳他宪法
    马耳他将举行罢工罢市
    明托夫号召为争取完全独立而斗争
    新华社19日讯　马耳他岛瓦莱塔消息：马耳他岛工党领袖明托夫18日在一次公众集会上号召全马耳他岛居民在英国下院通过废除马耳他岛宪法以后举行二十四小时的罢工和罢市，并且把这一天订为全国哀悼日。
    废除马耳他岛宪法是英国企图镇压马耳他岛人民的一个措施。在由于英国拒绝给予马耳他岛独立而使英国同马耳他岛各政党代表团之间谈判破裂后，英国就在本月初宣布废除承认马耳他岛居民有一定自治权利的宪法，而由英国总督直接统治马耳他岛。英国政府已经要求下院在本月下旬复会的时候通过它的关于废除马耳他岛宪法的法案。
    明托夫号召马耳他岛居民把这次罢工和罢市当作马耳他岛居民抗议英国政策的标志，他说：“我们应该以行动而不是只用言词来表达我们的感情。我们要求完全独立，这是马耳他岛居民最大的斗争。”
    明托夫要求马耳他岛居民抵制英国组织的或者有英国人参加的机构和仪式。
