Taiyuan, January 27th (Report from this newspaper) The Shanxi Machine Tool Factory adopted a method combining reasoning and scientific experimentation, enabling all employees to have a clear and consistent understanding of the question of "whether production can increase several times this year." Everyone is full of confidence and has plunged into the battle to ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

At the end of 1958, the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory overfulfilled its leap forward plan, with the total output value increasing nearly twofold compared to 1957, while the national plan for 1959 increased by about three times the actual completed figure of 1958. To this end, the factory Party committee called on all employees to increase production several times on the basis of existing equipment and manpower. After the call was issued, the vast majority of employees were full of confidence and responded actively; however, some employees believed that it was impossible to increase several times. Therefore, the factory Party committee organized cadres and workers to go to the Northeast to learn from the Machine Union Factory's experience of doubling production and launched a "learn from Machine Union, catch up with Machine Union, and surpass Machine Union" campaign to double production within the factory; at the same time, it organized the masses to conduct an ideological debate on "whether production can be doubled." During the debate, those who doubted the doubling presented their arguments rationally; those who advocated doubling convinced others with reason. All employees spoke freely, and if they could not persuade others, they conducted experiments on the spot. The great debate was both substantial and lively.

Is Production at Its Peak?

At the beginning of the debate, the first obstacle encountered was the resistance from the idea of "production reaching its peak." Some people said: "After the great leap forward last year, production has reached its peak, and it is impossible to double it again this year."

Those who advocated doubling did not agree with the above view. The first to come out to criticize them were some workers who had participated in the study of philosophy. They said: "Everything is constantly developing. Saying that production has reached its peak is not acknowledging the development of things. Whether production has reached its peak depends on whether there is still potential to be tapped in the equipment; whether the equipment has potential depends on whether our thinking is liberated and whether we dare to transform the equipment. Last year's hard work for a year is a fact, but we cannot only rely on hard work, we must also learn to work skillfully. Doing a good job in the technical revolution will yield even greater results than last year. How can you say that production has reached its peak?" In order to further criticize the theory of production reaching its peak, each workshop conducted debates and experiments. The employees of the 13th workshop helped Zhang Tianrui change his past scribing method. After the experiment, the scribing of washing nail machine rollers was shortened from one and a half hours to five minutes. Zhang Tianrui's confidence in doubling production increased, and those who said production had reached its peak were also convinced.

Is There Still "Oil" to be Extracted from the Technical Revolution?

At this time, someone raised a new question. They said: "Technical revolution is a good method, but you can't just keep revolutionizing endlessly! Technical innovations were carried out in the first half of last year, and simple machine tool movement was vigorously promoted in the second half of the year, and many equipments have been almost completely innovated. There won't be much 'oil' to extract this year." Qi Tianzhen, a young worker from the fifth workshop's fitter group, said: "In the past, fitters used manual operation, but now they use modern machines such as broaching machines and grinding machines. What more advanced methods can be revolutionized?"

Jiao Jun and Bai Jianwen, veteran workers from the fifth workshop's fitter group, thought to themselves: It is indeed a big step forward for fitters to use broaching machines and grinding machines to replace manual work, but the finish of the parts pulled and ground is not good, and the dimensions are incorrect. We still have to use files, isn't this potential? They expressed their opinions at the debate meeting and said: "If we improve the broaching and grinding machines so that they produce products that meet the standards and reduce a filing process, won't we double it? Who says there is no 'oil'?" Turner Kuang Shengren also criticized this, saying: "Saying that the technical revolution has no 'oil' is actually the idea of production reaching its peak. The original speed cutting of Feng Lixian's group's lathe has reached the highest level, and it seems to have reached its peak; but after being transformed by first-level worker Ke Shipian, it was increased from 240 revolutions to 360 revolutions. It can be seen that the original production was not at its peak; the technical revolution still has a lot of 'oil'. The key lies in whether we humans can fully exert our subjective initiative, whether we can correctly understand objective things, and actively transform objective things."

"Conditionalists" Surrender

After debate and experimentation, no one said that "production has reached its peak" or that "there is no 'oil' in the technical revolution"; however, new "conditionalists" came out to speak. Some said: "Our workshop has poor equipment and low technology, so we can't double it." Wang Fu, the foreman of the fifth workshop, calculated the equipment and labor in his work area and said: "We only have these machines and these people, at most we can increase it by two times. It is impossible to increase it by five times as required by the task."

In the debate, everyone used the facts of the Northeast Machine Union Factory to illustrate that even with poor equipment and technology, it is possible to double production. Worker Zhou Wenlan said: "The quality of equipment and the level of technology do have differences in the degree of doubling, but they are not absolute. Xu Zihong of our work section is a third-level lathe operator, so he should not be considered highly skilled! However, after he improved the tools, he doubled production. Can you say that it is impossible to double production just because the technical level is low? It is necessary to put forward different requirements for different equipment and different technical conditions; it is wrong to cling to this point and not actively think of ways." When the workers of Wang Fu's group discussed, they gave Wang Fu a great education on the idea of only counting heads and machines and not counting ideological factors. On the spot, the workers put forward 28 technical revolution suggestions for the group's 19 processes, which strengthened Wang Fu's confidence in doubling production multiple times. During the discussion of Jiang Cunxing's group in the 13th workshop, they believed that they could not double production without good machine tools and good cutting tools. Li Xingwang, a turner in this group, immediately used the method of improving operation and increasing the speed to increase the efficiency of machining vertical lathe turbines by 11 times, refuting the "conditionalist" theory with practice.

The problem was basically debated thoroughly, and the understanding was basically unified. Worker Liu Wuquan raised a new question. He said: Now there is a shortage of raw materials, and what is the use of doubling production, tapping potential, and making a fuss when there is no work to do? Most people thought this way of understanding the problem was wrong. They believed that the shortage of materials was a temporary phenomenon. As long as the equipment capacity is doubled, if there are no materials for this kind of work, another kind can be done; once the materials come, production can be doubled immediately. If there is equipment but no materials, people can do other things, but if there are materials but no equipment, they will be in a hurry. Some people also advocated that on the issue of materials, we should also think more about ways to tap potential, use scraps and substitutes, act as clever tailors, save good materials, and produce more work. People who originally thought that doubling production was impossible due to insufficient materials also had their ideas cleared up after the debate.

Having clarified the principles and undergone experimentation, people felt much better. Each workshop formulated plans to increase production by several times according to its own actual situation. In order to base the factory's doubling plan on a more reliable foundation, the factory's employees are conducting specific technical debates, studying drawings, changing models, and conducting scientific experiments. Once an experiment is successful, it is decided. Soon, the factory will formulate a factory-wide production doubling plan based on practical measures.

    山西机床厂谈思想做试验得出一致结论
    今年是铁定的跃进年
    全体职工齐心争上游，指标猛增几倍
    本报太原27日电　山西机床厂采取说理和科学试验相结合的办法，使全体职工对“今年生产能不能增长几倍”的问题有了明确一致的认识。大家都满怀信心地投入战斗，保证在今年实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    1958年底，山西机床厂超额完成了跃进计划，总产值比1957年增长将近一倍，而1959年的国家计划又比1958年实际完成数字提高三倍左右。为此，厂党委号召全厂职工在现有设备、人力的基础上，使生产再增长几倍。号召发出之后，绝大部分职工都信心百倍，积极响应；但是也有部分职工认为再增长几倍是不可能的。因此，该厂党委一面组织干部、工人到东北学习机联厂生产翻番经验，在厂内开展“学机联、赶机联、超机联”的生产翻番运动；一面组织群众进行“生产到底能不能翻番”的思想辩论。在辩论过程中，怀疑翻番者，据理力辩；主张翻番者，以理服人。全体职工畅所欲言，说不通就当场进行试验，大辩论进行得有虚有实，生动活泼。
    生产是不是到顶了？
    辩论一开始，首先遇到的是“生产到顶论”思想的抵触。有一部分人说：“经过去年大跃进，生产已经到顶了，今年再不能翻番了”。
    主张翻番的人，不同意上述看法，最先出来批驳的是一部分参加过学哲学的工人。他们说：一切事物都是不断发展的，说生产到顶，就是不承认事物的发展。生产到不到顶，要看设备还有没有潜力可挖；设备有没有潜力，又要看我们的思想是不是解放了，敢不敢对设备进行改造。去年苦战一年确是事实，可是我们不能光靠苦干，还得学会巧干。搞好技术革命，就会收到比去年更大的效果。怎能说生产到顶了呢？”为了更进一步批驳生产到顶论，各个车间一面辩论一面进行试验，十三车间职工帮助张天瑞改变了过去的划线方法，试验后，使洗钉机滚筒划线，由原来一个半小时，缩短为五分钟。张天瑞翻番的信心增强了，说生产到顶的人也服气了。
    技术革命还有油水吗？
    这时，又有人提出了新问题。他们说：“技术革命是好办法，可不能没完没了地革呀！去年上半年搞技术革新，下半年大搞简易机床运动又革新，很多设备革的差不多了，今年再革也没有多大油水了。”五车间钳工小组青年工人祁天真等说：“过去钳工是用手工操作，现在用拉床、磨床等现代机器操作，再革还能革出什么更先进的办法呢？”
    五车间钳工小组老工人焦俊、白建文等心里想：钳工用拉床、磨床代替手工确是进了一大步，可是现在拉、磨出来的活，光洁度不好，尺寸不对，还得锉刀锉，这不就是潜力吗？他们在辩论会上发表了自己的意见，并说：“如果改进一下拉、磨床，使它们产出合标准的产品来，减少一道锉刀工序，不就翻上去了吗？谁说没有油水？”车工邝生仁也对此进行了批判，他说：“说技术革命没油水，实际上就是生产到顶论的思想，冯力先小组的元车是高速切削，走刀量已达到最高水平，看起来是到顶了；可是经过一级工人柯世篇改造以后，就由二百四十转提高到三百六十转，可见，原来生产并不是到顶了；技术革命还很有油水。关键在于我们人能不能充分发挥主观能动作用，能不能正确认识客观事物，并积极改造客观事物。”
    “唯条件论”者服输
    经过辩论和试验，说“生产到顶”，“技术革命没油水”的人没有了；可是新的“唯条件论”者又出来说话了。有的说：“咱车间设备差，技术低，翻不上去”。五车间工长王富算了算自己工区的设备、劳力说：“我们就有这些机器，这些人，顶多提高两倍，像任务要求那样提高五倍，根本办不到。”
    在辩论中，大家用东北机联厂的事实，说明设备和技术差，也能翻番。工人周文兰说：“设备好坏，技术高低，在翻番程度上固然有差别，但，不是绝对的。咱工段许自洪是个三级车工，应该说水平不高吧！可是，他改进了工具以后，就使生产翻上去了。能说技术水平低，就翻不上去吗？对不同设备、不同技术条件，提出不同要求是必要的；死抱住这一条，不积极想办法，就不对了”。王富小组的工人在讨论时，对王富只算人头账、机器账，不算思想账的思想，给予很大教育，当场工人们对小组的十九道工序，提出了二十八项技术革命建议，从而使王富增强了多翻番的信心。十三车间姜存兴小组讨论时，认为没有好机床，没有好刀具，不能翻番。这个组的车工李兴旺当场用改进操作，提高转速的办法，使加工立式车床涡轮的工效提高了十一倍，用实践驳倒了“唯条件论”。
    问题基本辩透了，认识也基本上达到了统一，工人刘务泉又提出了新问题。他说：现在原材料供应不足，搞翻番，挖潜力，闹完了没活干，这有什么用呢？大多数人认为这样认识问题不对。他们认为：材料不足，是暂时现象，只要设备能力翻上去，这种活没有材料，可以干另一种；一旦材料来了，马上就可以使生产翻番。有设备没材料，人可以做别的，有材料没设备就会手忙脚乱。还有人主张在材料问题上，也应该多想办法挖潜力，利用边料、代料，作巧裁缝，节省好料，多出些活。原来认为材料不足就不能翻番的人，经过辩论，思想也通了。
    既讲清了道理，又经过了试验，人们心情大为舒畅。各车间都根据自己的实际情况，分别制订了提高几倍的计划。为了使全厂的翻番计划建立在更加可靠的基础上，该厂职工正在进行具体的技术辩论，研究图纸、换型和科学试验，试验成功一项，订下来一项，不久，该厂即将制定出有切实措施为依据的全厂性生产翻番计划来。
