Deep Sympathy, Warm Support
By Our Correspondent

Beijing people, along with the people of the whole country, have always supported the national revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They have voiced their support for the people of the Middle East in their resistance against imperialist aggression, and they have also supported the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence. Yesterday, filled with indignation, they held another rally, once again expressing their warmest support for the people of Cuba and the Congo who are persisting in their anti-imperialist struggle, and sending out earth-shaking roars against American imperialism and Belgian colonialism.

Firm and Powerful Voices

Yesterday, when the sky was still dim, the people of the capital, angered by the aggressive actions of American imperialism, poured into the Beijing Gymnasium from factories, schools, government offices, shops, and people's communes in the suburbs. More than 10,000 people from all walks of life and ethnic groups gathered to hold a rally in support of the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. People saw the latest news from Havana and Leopoldville in the People's Daily they had just bought, and they sang the song "Victory Surely Belongs to the Cuban and Congolese People" with excitement. People raised their fists high and shouted the same slogan: "Oppose American imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs!" "Oppose the Belgian authorities' massacre of the Congolese people!"

High Spirits at the Rally

"The era when American imperialists run rampant in Latin America is coming to an end," the whole of Africa has been set in motion, now Africa is full of volcanoes, some have already erupted, and some are about to erupt. This was the firm and powerful voice of Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Peng Zhen's speech stirred the hearts of everyone. One wave of slogans had barely died down before another rose, and some people even stood up from their seats and shouted excitedly. Comrade Peng Zhen waved repeatedly before the whole venue calmed down. People then held their breath and listened to his solemn speech: "The 650 million people of the People's Republic of China stand on the same front as all the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for independence and freedom. Their enemies are also our enemies, and their struggles are also our struggles."

Persistence in Struggle Means Victory

The Chinese people, who have suffered long-term oppression by imperialism, understand best the strong desire of the Cuban and Congolese brothers to strive for independence and oppose colonial rule. At this rally, Liu Anchen, a member of the Nanyuan People's Commune, was so moved that he shed tears. This peasant, who had herded cattle for landlords and worked as a hired hand since he was a child, had experienced the same tragic life as the Cuban and Congolese brothers. Now Liu Anchen stood up! He shouted loudly: Cuban and Congolese brothers: We must work with you to drive out American imperialism and Belgian colonialism!

Gong Yalan, a female worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, worked with several workers overnight the day before yesterday to write a new song in support of the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. She stood among the workers and sang loudly.

Her singing was echoed by the crowd, and the passionate and inspiring singing made people even more excited. Many old mothers with wrinkles on their foreheads shouted along with everyone: Down with the imperialist colonial system!

Pricking the Paper Tiger

On the podium, speaker after speaker took the floor, their speeches often interrupted by slogans and thunderous applause. When people heard writer Lao She give an "anatomical operation" to the imperialist paper tiger, bursts of laughter suddenly erupted. Liu Jiuchang, a worker from the Third Engineering Company of Beijing Municipal Construction, who was sitting on the west platform, talked with the people sitting next to him about how he and his comrades-in-arms, when he was a gunner in the Chinese People's Volunteers, smashed American military vehicles and turned tanks into "dead turtles". The image of the paper tiger vividly reappeared in his memory. He used his own experience to testify that imperialism can be defeated!

Beijing – Havana – Banks of the Congo River

The broadcast transmitted the resolution of representatives of all sectors of the capital’s people, representing 650 million Chinese people, in support of the anti-imperialist struggles of Cuba and the Congo: “The Chinese people, who have suffered more than a century of imperialist enslavement, fully sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Cuban people to defend national independence and oppose the interference of American imperialism, and fully sympathize with and support the Congolese people's tenacious and heroic struggle against the bloody suppression of Belgian colonialism." This voice spread throughout the city and across the country with the radio waves.

Cuban and Congolese brothers, the Chinese people support you!

    深切的同情　热情的支持
    本报记者
    北京人民同全国人民一道，一向支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族革命运动。他们声援过中东人民反抗帝国主义的侵略，也支持过阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争。昨天，他们又带着激愤的心情举行集会，再一次向坚持反帝斗争的古巴和刚果人民表示了最热情的声援，向美国帝国主义和比利时殖民主义者发出了震天的怒吼。
    坚定而有力的声音
    昨天，当天色还是微明的时候，为美帝国主义的侵略行动所激怒了的首都人民，就从工厂、学校、机关、商店和郊区的人民公社涌向北京体育馆，他们——一万多各界各族的人民，将在这里举行支援古巴、刚果人民反帝斗争的大会。人们从刚刚买到的人民日报上看到了来自哈瓦那和利奥波德维尔的最新消息，他们激昂地唱起“胜利一定属于古巴、刚果人民”的歌子。人们高高举起自己的拳头喊出了同一的吼声：“反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政！”“反对比利时当局屠杀刚果人民！”
    大会上群情激愤
    “美帝国主义者在拉丁美洲横行霸道的时代，已经接近末日了”，整个非洲已经动起来了，现在非洲到处是火山，有的已经爆发，有的将要爆发。这是中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记彭真同志坚定而有力的声音。彭真同志的讲话激动着每一个人的心。口号声一片刚停，一片又起，有的人甚至激昂地从坐位上站起来呼喊。彭真同志一再挥手，整个会场才平静下来。人们又屏息地听他庄严的讲话：“我们中华人民共和国的六亿五千万人民，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切争取独立自由的人民，是站在一条战线上的。他们的敌人也就是我们的敌人，他们的斗争也就是我们的斗争”。
    坚持斗争就是胜利
    身受帝国主义长期压迫的中国人民最了解古巴、刚果兄弟们争取独立和反对殖民主义统治的强烈愿望。在这次集会上，南苑人民公社社员刘安臣激动得流出了眼泪。这个从小就给地主放牛、当雇工的农民，经历过古巴、刚果兄弟们同样的悲惨生活。现在刘安臣站起来了！他高声呼喊：古巴、刚果兄弟们：我们要和你们一道，把美国帝国主义和比利时殖民主义者赶走！
    石景山发电厂女工龚雅兰前天连夜和几个工人一起赶写出一首支援古巴、刚果人民斗争的新歌。她站在工人群众中纵声高唱。
    她的歌声在人群中得到了应和，慷慨激昂的歌声，使人们更加激动起来。有许多额上布满皱纹的老妈妈同大家一起高呼：打倒帝国主义殖民制度！
    戳穿纸老虎
    讲台上，讲话的人一个接着一个，他们的讲话常常被口号声和春雷般的掌声所打断。当人们听到作家老舍在给帝国主义纸老虎作“解剖手术”的时候，突然迸发出一阵阵的笑声。坐在西台上的北京市政建设第三工程公司的工人刘久昌和坐在他旁边的人们谈起了他在中国人民志愿军当炮手时，和战友们一起把美国军队汽车打得稀烂、坦克打成了“死乌龟”的情形，纸老虎的形象又逼真地重现在他的记忆里。他用自己的经历作证说：帝国主义是可以打败的！
    北京——哈瓦那——刚果河畔
    广播器传出了首都各界人民代表六亿五千万中国人民通过的支持古巴、刚果反帝斗争的决议：“深受过一百多年帝国主义奴役的中国人民，完全同情和支持古巴人民保卫民族独立、反对美国帝国主义干涉的正义斗争，完全同情和支持刚果人民顽强英勇的反抗比利时殖民主义的血腥镇压斗争。”这个声音随着广播电台的电波传播到全城，传播到全国。
    古巴、刚果兄弟，中国人民支持你们！
