Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its meeting at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) on January 29th, discussing Comrade Khrushchev's report.

    The first speaker at the afternoon meeting was Kahnberzin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party. Kahnberzin said in his speech that the Seven-Year Plan is the most important milestone in the development of the Soviet national economy and in the construction of communism. The implementation of this plan will make the socialist camp stronger and create insurmountable obstacles in the path of warmongers.
    Vakoleva, a representative from Belarus and chairman of the "Defend the Motherland" Collective Farm, introduced the situation of the "Defend the Motherland" Collective Farm and its seven-year plan in her speech. She has been the chairman of this collective farm for seven years. Kovaleva said that the farm's seven-year plan could be completed in four or five years.
    The next speaker was Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.
    Kiselyov, First Secretary of the Rostov Oblast Committee of the CPSU, said in his speech that the entire Soviet people warmly support the Seven-Year Plan. He said that enterprises, collective farms, and state farms in the Rostov Oblast have widely launched a socialist competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Many factories have proposed guarantees to complete the new plan in five or six years. The speaker said that this decision is realistic. The achievements already made prove its reality.
    At the afternoon meeting, Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.
    The chairman of the afternoon meeting announced that the Congress had received congratulatory messages from the Jordanian Communist Party, the Luxembourg Communist Party, the San Marino Communist Party, and the Guatemalan Labor Party.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today.

    The first speaker at the meeting was Gayevoi, First Secretary of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party. He said that the Seven-Year Plan is a plan for a huge upsurge in the Soviet economy and culture, and this plan arms the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people with a program for communist construction. More than one million people in the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast participated in the discussion of the draft report on the Seven-Year Plan.
    The next speaker was Suslov, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Suslov said that an inspiring and historically significant prospect has been presented before the Soviet state. The Soviet people, united around the Communist Party, have reached such a high point that it is now possible for our country to enter a new and most important period of development—a period of fully unfolding the construction of a communist society.
    Suslov emphasized that these words in Khrushchev's draft report summarized the entire history of the Soviet state and provided a scientific explanation of the new era that is beginning.
    Suslov said that the Seven-Year Plan is completely realistic and undoubtedly achievable because it is based on scientific Marxism-Leninism.
    Suslov said that the high level of development of the Soviet productive forces and the high level of scientific and technological development make it possible to propose and solve the great tasks in our plan. Our country already has a contingent of experts and skilled workers capable of solving any task.
    Suslov then talked about a series of theoretical issues. He believes that these issues are of decisive significance in the period of fully unfolding the construction of a communist society in the Soviet Union. He said that there is no insurmountable boundary between the lower and higher stages of communism, and socialism will gradually develop into communism. He said that this process is long-term and cannot be completed in seven years. Throughout this entire period, the leading role will still be played by the working class and the party of the working class. The Seven-Year Plan will make all the basic outlines of communism both clearly visible and practically tangible.
    Suslov emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen ideological work and overcome the phenomenon of ideological work being divorced from the practice of building communism. He said that we must raise our ideological work to a new level. He pointed out the importance of strengthening the theoretical work on the following issues: the transition from socialism to communism, the international communist movement and the international workers' movement, and the national liberation struggles in colonies and dependencies.
    Suslov pointed out the special significance of elucidating the question of the role of the state. He said that Khrushchev's report has formulated extremely valuable principles on this issue. In this regard, Suslov talked about the growing role of the Soviets of Workers' Representatives in ensuring the participation of all people in state management. He said that in the period of completing the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, in the period of transition from socialism to communism, the Soviets will play a decisive role. Its mission is to further consolidate the alliance of the working class and the peasantry.
    Suslov said that the role and significance of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, cooperatives, and other social organizations with tens of millions of members will increase.
    When talking about carrying out education in a communist attitude towards labor and cherishing socialist property, Suslov said that in addition to various forms of education, the practice of building communism itself will also play a great role in this regard. In this regard, he emphasized the significance of correctly solving the problem of linking schools and education with labor production. He pointed out that schools should actually prepare for participation in labor and participation in communist construction.
    Suslov then said that newspapers, literature, and art play an important role in the ideological education of the working people.
    Suslov then said that our party has strengthened its ties with the masses, restored Lenin's principles of leadership, and smashed and abandoned the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. The whole world is listening to the voice of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is no accident that our Congress is the center of attention of the world's public. Our party will always be loyal to the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and its main strength lies in this.
    Suslov said that the imperialists and their lackeys vainly attempt to hinder our progress. However, the reactionary forces' attempts to block our path to communism are hopeless. Capitalism is struggling desperately to keep its head above water, but it is becoming increasingly difficult. The crimes that capitalism has committed against humanity are dragging it to the bottom, and capitalism will inevitably give way to a truly progressive system—socialism.
    Vladimir Gorbunov, an installer on the world's first nuclear icebreaker, the "Lenin," reported the achievements of the Leningrad shipbuilders to the delegates of the Congress.
    Dolinnyuk, a squad leader of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Ternopol Oblast of Ukraine, talked about the new life that has emerged in the rural areas of the Ternopol Oblast since the reunification of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian Republic in 1939. She also talked about how the peasant women of the Ternopol Oblast discussed the tasks of further improving Ukrainian agriculture put forward in the Seven-Year Plan with a sense of ownership. She said that their farm will guarantee the completion of the Seven-Year Plan in four or five years.
    Serdyuk, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moldavian Communist Party, talked about the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Moldavian Republic during the years of Soviet power. He said that in the fifteen years of peaceful construction and in the less than ten years since the establishment of the collective farm system, relying on the immeasurable assistance and rich experience of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and other fraternal republics, the former Bessarabia has completely changed.
    Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered congratulatory messages at the meeting. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants.
    The Congress continued after a short break. Mukhitdinov, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, spoke first. Mukhitdinov said that there are more than 100 nationalities and ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and they enjoy equal rights, working side by side as members of a multinational family.
    In his speech, Mukhitdinov talked about several issues of the party's nationalities policy from the perspective of its domestic and international significance. He pointed out that our party and the Russian people have helped all nationalities in our country establish their own states and turned the border republics into highly developed regions in terms of economy and culture.
    Mukhitdinov said that one of the characteristics of the party and the Soviet state's nationalities policy is to first develop those economic sectors in each national republic that have the most favorable conditions. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates the rapid development of industry in the Kazakh, Uzbek, and other republics in the east of the Soviet Union. After the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the economies of these republics will undergo not only quantitative changes but also qualitative changes.
    Mukhitdinov pointed out that Khrushchev's report developed the scientific and theoretical basis of the party's nationalities policy. Mukhitdinov particularly emphasized the spiritual commonality of all socialist nations in the Soviet Union. He then said that the main thing is the party's leading and guiding role, and the party itself is a vivid example of internationalism.
    Mukhitdinov emphasized that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has aroused a surge of creative enthusiasm among all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Mukhitdinov then talked about the international significance of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the people of Asian and African countries who have gotten rid of or are getting rid of dependent status and are embarking on the road of independent national development.
    Mukhitdinov pointed out that recently, Western countries have been trying to impose neo-colonialism on Eastern countries with the help of so-called blocs. He said that the people of Eastern countries are increasingly beginning to understand the harm of their governments forming such blocs.
    Mukhitdinov pointed out that recently, many countries in Asia and Africa have been increasingly demanding active neutrality and non-participation in imperialist blocs. He said that our government welcomes the position of these countries because the basis of these countries' foreign policy is the famous "Panchashila" principles. Mukhitdinov emphasized that the Yugoslav revisionists are helping imperialism in Eastern countries, and they are trying to provoke Eastern countries' distrust of the policies of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries. Mukhitdinov also emphasized that the Yugoslav revisionists are playing the role of imperialism's servants in the East.
    Mukhitdinov continued, in individual countries in the East, the ruling authorities are trying to stifle the enthusiasm of democratic forces. This is being done under the banner of fighting the "communist danger." Mukhitdinov emphasized that this only suits the taste of imperialism. The communists of Eastern countries, like communists all over the world, are the most steadfast fighters for the happiness of mankind.
    Mukhitdinov hopes that the leaders of these countries will make wise decisions that are in line with the interests of the progress and prosperity of their people.
    When talking about the development of political, economic, and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and Eastern countries in the past five years, Mukhitdinov said that the Soviet Union has always been and will always be a loyal friend of the East.
    The last speaker at this morning's meeting was Kitalov, the captain of the tractor team of the "Twentieth Congress of the CPSU" Collective Farm in the Kirovograd Oblast of Ukraine and a socialist labor hero.
    Kitalov said that according to the initiative of his work team, a competition to adopt comprehensive mechanization in planting crops, to efficiently utilize technical equipment, and to achieve high yields has been widely launched in Ukraine. He said that agricultural workers in the Kirovograd Oblast have proposed a guarantee to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years.
    The morning meeting ended at 2:00 PM Moscow time. (Attached photo)

    苏斯洛夫在苏共代表大会上指出
    七年计划将使苏联初具共产主义轮廓
    穆希金诺夫说苏联各民族的创造热情空前高涨
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会29日下午四时（莫斯科时间）继续举行会议，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。
    在下午会议上首先发言的是拉脱维亚共产党中央委员会第一书记卡恩别尔津。卡恩别尔津在发言中说，七年计划是苏联国民经济发展中和共产主义建设中最重要的里程碑。执行这一计划的结果社会主义阵营将更为强大，在战争贩子的道路上将产生不可克服的障碍。
    白俄罗斯代表、“保卫祖国”集体农庄主席瓦科列娃在发言中介绍了“保卫祖国”集体农庄的情况和它的七年计划，她担任这一集体农庄主席已有七年。科瓦列娃说，农庄的七年计划可以在四、五年内完成。
    接着发言的是苏联外交部长葛罗米柯。
    苏共罗斯托夫州委员会第一书记基谢廖夫在发言中谈到，全体苏联人民热烈拥护七年计划。他说，罗斯托夫州内的各企业、集体农庄和国营农场广泛展开了争取提前完成七年计划的社会主义竞赛。许多工厂提出了争取在五、六年内完成新计划的保证。发言人说，这种决定是现实的。已经取得的成就证明了它的现实性。
    在下午会议上，保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成、越南劳动党主席胡志明、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查向代表大会致了贺词。他们的讲话都受到了热烈欢迎。
    下午会议的主席曾宣布，代表大会收到了约旦共产党、卢森堡共产党、圣马力诺共产党以及危地马拉劳动党的贺电。
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫举行。
    会上，首先发言的是乌克兰共产党第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州委员会第一书记加叶伏伊。他说，七年计划——这是苏联经济和文化巨大高涨的计划，这一计划以共产主义建设的纲领武装苏联共产党和苏联人民。在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州有一百多万人参加了七年计划报告提纲的讨论。
    接着发言的是苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员苏斯洛夫。
    苏斯洛夫说，在苏维埃国家的面前已展现出振奋人心的具有历史意义的前景。团结在共产党周围的苏联人民已达到了这样的高峰，使我国现在有可能进入新的最重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。
    苏斯洛夫强调说，赫鲁晓夫报告提纲中的这些话总结了苏维埃国家的整个历史，并对开始进入的新时期作了科学的解说。
    苏斯洛夫说，七年计划是完全现实的，这是毫无疑问可以完成的计划，因为它是以科学的马克思列宁主义为基础的。
    苏斯洛夫说，苏联生产力发展的高度水平和科学技术发展的高度水平使得有可能提出和解决我们计划中的伟大任务。我国已有了一支能够解决任何任务的专家和熟练工人的队伍。
    苏斯洛夫接着谈到了一系列理论问题。他认为这些问题在苏联全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期中有着决定性的意义。他说，在共产主义的低级和高级阶段之间没有不可逾越的界限，社会主义将逐渐发展到共产主义。他说，这个过程是长期的，不可能在七年中就完成。在这一整个时期内，起领导作用的将仍然是工人阶级和工人阶级的政党。七年计划将使共产主义所有基本轮廓既可以清楚看见，又可以实际摸到。
    苏斯洛夫强调指出，必须加强思想工作和克服思想工作同建设共产主义的实践脱节的现象。他说，必须把我们的思想工作提高到一个新的水平。他指出了加强如下一些问题的理论工作的重要性：即关于由社会主义过渡到共产主义的问题，关于国际共产主义运动和国际工人运动的问题以及关于殖民地和附属国的民族解放斗争的问题。
    苏斯洛夫指出了阐明关于国家的作用问题的特别意义。他说，赫鲁晓夫的报告已就这个问题拟定了极有价值的原理。在这方面苏斯洛夫谈到了保证全体人民参加国家管理的劳动者代表苏维埃的日益增长的作用。他说，在完成苏联发展国民经济的七年计划时期，在从社会主义向共产主义过渡的时期，苏维埃将具有决定作用。它的使命是更加巩固工人阶级和农民的联盟。
    苏斯洛夫说，工会、共青团、合作社及其它拥有数千万人的社会团体的作用和意义将增加。
    苏斯洛夫在谈到进行以共产主义态度对待劳动和爱护社会主义财产的教育工作时说，除了各种教育形式以外，建设共产主义的实践本身在这方面也将起很大作用。在这方面他着重指出正确解决学校和教育同劳动生产联系的问题的意义。他指出，学校应当实际上为参加劳动和参加共产主义建设作准备。
    苏斯洛夫接着说，报刊、文学和艺术在对劳动人民的思想教育方面起着重要的作用。
    苏斯洛夫接着又说，我党加强了同群众的联系，恢复了列宁主义的领导原则，粉碎和摒弃了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。全世界都在倾听苏联共产党的声音。我们的代表大会是全世界公众注意的中心，这不是偶然的。我们的党永远忠于马克思列宁主义学说，而它的主要力量也正在于此。
    苏斯洛夫说，帝国主义者和他们的走狗妄想阻挠我们前进。但是，反动势力想堵塞我们走向共产主义的道路的企图是毫无希望的。资本主义拼命挣扎，想把头部浮在水面上，但是越来越困难。资本主义对人类所犯下的罪行正在把它拖向水底，资本主义必将让位给真正进步的制度——社会主义。
    世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”的安装工弗拉基米尔·戈尔布诺夫向大会的代表们报告了列宁格勒造船工人的成绩。
    乌克兰特尔诺波尔州的斯大林集体农庄小队长多林纽克在发言中谈到自从1939年西乌克兰重新合并入乌克兰共和国以后，特尔诺波尔州农村所出现的新的生活。他还谈到特尔诺波尔州的农民妇女以主人翁的态度讨论了七年计划中提出的进一步提高乌克兰农业的任务。她说，她们的农庄将保证在四、五年内完成七年计划。
    摩尔达维亚共产党中央委员会第一书记谢尔久克谈到摩尔达维亚加盟共和国在苏维埃政权年代里所发生的巨大变化。他说，在和平建设的十五年以及集体农庄制度建立以来不到十年的时间内，依靠俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰以及其他兄弟共和国的不可估量的援助和丰富的经验，从前的比萨拉比亚完全变样了。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记泽登巴尔和印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记艾地在会上致了贺词。他们的讲话受到与会者热烈欢迎。
    代表大会经过短暂的休息后继续开会。苏共中央主席团委员穆希金诺夫首先发言。穆希金诺夫说，苏联有一百多个民族和部族，它们享有平等的权利，作为一个多民族大家庭的成员并肩劳动。
    穆希金诺夫在发言中从党的民族政策的国内意义和国际意义的角度谈到了这个政策的若干问题。他指出，我们党和俄罗斯人民帮助我国各民族建立了国家并且使边疆区的共和国变成了在经济和文化方面高度发展的地区。
    穆希金诺夫说，党和苏维埃国家民族政策的特点之一，就是在各民族共和国首先发展那些具备最有利条件的经济部门。在七年计划中规定了苏联东部的哈萨克、乌兹别克等共和国的工业飞快发展的速度。七年计划完成后，这些共和国的经济不仅会发生量变，而且也会发生质变。
    穆希金诺夫指出，在赫鲁晓夫的报告中发展了党的民族政策的科学理论基础。穆希金诺夫特别强调指出了苏联各社会主义民族精神上的共同性。他接着说，主要的是党的领导作用和指导作用，党本身就是体现国际主义的生动典范。
    穆希金诺夫强调指出，苏联发展国民经济的七年计划在苏联各民族中引起了创造热情的高涨。　  穆希金诺夫随后谈到苏联七年计划对亚非各国人民的国际意义，这些国家人民已经摆脱或正在摆脱附属地位，走上独立国家的发展道路。
    穆希金诺夫指出，最近西方国家企图借助所谓的集团把新式殖民主义强加给东方国家。他说，东方各国人民日益开始明白其本国政府结成这种集团的政策的危害性。
    穆希金诺夫指出，最近亚非许多国家日益强烈地要求积极中立，不参加帝国主义集团。他说，我国政府欢迎这些国家的立场，因为这些国家外交政策的基础是著名的“潘查希拉”原则。穆希金诺夫强调说，南斯拉夫修正主义者正在东方国家中为帝国主义帮忙，他们企图挑拨东方国家不信任苏联和社会主义阵营各国的政策。穆希金诺夫同时强调指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者正在扮演帝国主义在东方的仆从的角色。
    穆希金诺夫继续说，在东方的个别国家里，执政当局企图扼杀民主力量的积极性。这是在同“共产主义危险”作斗争的旗帜下进行的。穆希金诺夫着重指出，这只适合帝国主义的口胃。东方国家的共产党人同全世界的共产党人一样，是争取人类幸福的最坚定的战士。
    穆希金诺夫希望这些国家的领导人会作出符合本国人民进步和繁荣的利益的英明决定。
    在谈到苏联最近五年以来发展同东方国家的政治、经济和文化联系的情况时，穆希金诺夫说，苏联一贯是、而且将来也是东方的忠实朋友。
    今天上午会议最后一个发言的是乌克兰基洛夫格勒州“苏共第二十次代表大会”集体农庄拖拉机队长、社会主义劳动英雄基塔洛夫。
    基塔洛夫说，根据他的工作队的倡议，在乌克兰广泛展开了一个争取在种植农作物时采用全盘机械化、争取高效率利用技术设备和丰产的竞赛。他说，基洛夫格勒州的农业劳动者已提出七年计划五年完成的保证。
