Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd: The Philippine government decided on the 22nd to summon its ambassador to the United States, Romulo, back home to study Philippine-US relations. Prior to this, the US ambassador to the Philippines, Bohlen, had already departed on the 20th to return to Washington for consultations.

Many American and Philippine newspapers openly acknowledge that Philippine-US relations are deteriorating. The *Manila Daily Bulletin*, which is close to the US embassy, wrote that summoning an ambassador home for consultation "is usually a dangerous sign," indicating "the deterioration of relations to such an extent that long-distance telecommunications with the home government are no longer sufficient."

The Philippines is very unwilling to be treated as a "satellite state" of the United States in international diplomatic circles. According to an Associated Press report on the 20th, the Philippine representative to the United Nations has begun to work to wash away the shame they feel: the Philippines is seen as just a rubber-stamp satellite state of the United States. The US authorities have long turned a deaf ear to or deliberately delayed the repeated requests made by Philippine congressional leaders and government authorities to revise the unequal military and economic agreements between the Philippines and the United States.

In military affairs, negotiations to revise the Philippine-US military base agreement, which began as early as 1956, broke down due to the US stubbornly insisting on maintaining judicial jurisdiction over American soldiers who commit crimes. Although the Philippines has repeatedly requested the resumption of negotiations, formal negotiations have not yet reopened. The Philippines is also worried that the United States will use the so-called "common defense" arrangement to unilaterally drag the Philippines into the disaster of war.

The Philippine public points out that the current Philippine-US trade agreement is the root cause of the Philippines' financial and economic difficulties. It has made the Philippine treasury increasingly empty and its foreign exchange reserves close to exhaustion. Recently, the Philippine government's request to restore the special import tax (its predecessor was the foreign exchange tax) on American goods to 17% in order to make up for the decline in tariffs has also been strongly opposed by the United States.

Most of the loans that the United States promised during Garcia's visit to the United States last June have not yet been disbursed. This makes the Philippines feel very hurt. Philippine people often say that the United States always feels very confident about the Philippines and does not take it seriously.

The Philippines is also very dissatisfied with the various conditions attached to American loans. There is a rising voice in the country calling for borrowing money from countries other than the United States. The United States refuses to give up its land ownership of its bases in the Philippines and its sovereignty over the weapons it "aids" the Philippines with, and is slow to grant the Philippines sufficient compensation for wartime losses and gold devaluation compensation for foreign exchange reserves. Philippine people believe that when they are asking for what they are entitled to, they are treated as if they were begging for favors.

The arrogance and domineering of the United States is increasingly playing the role of a "negative teacher." *Manila Chronicle* columnist Soliongco wrote painfully: "After years of humiliation, we have realized that the military base agreement signed in 1947 is just a shackle." Philippine entrepreneur Marcelo said that the Philippine-US trade agreement has been hindering rather than promoting the economic development of the Philippines.

As anti-American sentiment rises among the Philippine people and officials, US imperialism is very worried about the rise of Philippine nationalism. It has been revealed that in October of last year, it instigated some pro-American military officers to secretly plot a coup in order to overthrow the Garcia government and suppress all Philippine people with nationalist tendencies. President Garcia has already launched a new policy of establishing close relations with other non-communist Asian countries (including neutral countries).

American newspapers, which have always called the Philippines the "democratic showcase" of the United States, have had to express concern about the country's growing opposition to American colonialism. The Associated Press exclaimed on the 20th: In the Philippines, which has long been considered a bastion of pro-Western thought, Asian nationalism is on the rise!

### 菲律宾也受不了美国的气  反美情绪在高涨　同美国关系紧张

    菲律宾也受不了美国的气
    反美情绪在高涨　同美国关系紧张
    新华社23日讯　菲律宾政府在22日决定传召驻美国大使罗慕洛回国，以便研究美菲的关系。在这以前，美国驻菲律宾大使波伦已经在20日奉召启程回华盛顿述职。
    很多美国和菲律宾的报刊都公开承认，美菲关系正在日益恶化。接近美国大使馆的“马尼拉日报”写道，传召一个大使回国磋商“通常是一个危险的讯号”，这表明“关系的恶化到了那种程度，以至同本国政府联系的长途电讯设备已经不敷应用了”。
    菲律宾对于在国际外交场合上总被当作是美国的“卫星国”这种情况很不甘心。据美联社20日报道，菲律宾驻联合国代表开始努力洗去他们所感到的这样的耻辱：菲律宾被认为只是美国的一个橡皮图章卫星国。美国当局长期以来对菲律宾国会领袖和政府当局一再提出的修改美菲之间的军事和经济方面的不平等协定的要求采取充耳不闻或故意拖延的态度。
    在军事方面，早在1956年已经开始的修改美菲军事基地协定的谈判，由于美国顽固地要保持对犯罪的美国军人的司法裁判权而宣告破裂，虽然菲律宾已经一再提出恢复谈判的要求，正式谈判却至今没有重开。菲律宾还担心，美国会利用所谓“共同防御”的安排，片面地把菲律宾拖到战争灾难里。
    菲律宾公众指出，现行的美菲贸易协定是菲律宾财政经济困难的根源。它使得菲律宾国库日益空虚，外汇储备濒于枯竭。最近，菲律宾政府要求把对美国商品的特别进口税（它的前身是外汇税）恢复到17％的水平，以弥补关税的下降，这也遭到美国的强烈反对。
    美国在去年6月加西亚访美时所许下的贷款至今绝大部分没有发放。这使得菲律宾觉得感情很受伤害。菲律宾人士常常说，美国总觉得对菲律宾很有把握而不把它当作一回事。
    菲律宾对于美国贷款所附带的种种条件也感到很不满。国内正响起一种向美国以外的国家借钱的呼声。美国拒绝放弃对它在菲律宾的基地的土地所有权和它“援助”菲律宾的武器的主权，迟迟不给予菲律宾足够的战时损失赔偿和外汇储备方面的黄金贬值补偿。菲律宾人士认为，当他们讨取分内应得的款项的时候却被当作是乞求施惠一般。
    美国的骄横跋扈，正在越来越大地起着“反面教员”的作用。“马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家索力昂科沉痛地写道：“在受了多年侮辱以后，我们已经认识到，在1947年签订的军事基地协定只是一种羁绊而已”。菲律宾企业家马塞洛说，美菲贸易协定一直在阻碍而不是促进菲律宾的经济发展。
    随着菲律宾人民和官方反美情绪的高涨，美帝国主义非常担心菲律宾民族主义倾向的抬头。据揭露，它曾经在去年10月间一度唆使一些亲美军人密谋策动政变，以便推翻加西亚政府和镇压一切有民族主义倾向的菲律宾人士。而加西亚总统已经发起了一个同其他非共产党亚洲国家（包括中立国家）建立密切关系的新政策。
    一向把菲律宾称为美国的“民主橱窗”的美国报刊，已经不得不对这个国家的日益增长的反对美国殖民主义的情绪表示不安。美联社20日惊呼说：在长期以来被认为是亲西方的思想的堡垒的菲律宾，亚洲的民族主义正在高涨！
