Xinhua News Agency, January 17th -- The Beijing Railway Bureau, after mobilizing the masses to break down some conventions restricting production, has successively improved and established new systems to ensure safe train operation and promote the development of productive forces.

Under the unified leadership of the Bureau's Party Committee, the Bureau launched two relatively large-scale "Break Conventions, Establish New Systems" campaigns in the first half of last year. When the workers and masses fiercely attacked conventions, the Bureau's Party Committee promptly proposed to the masses that the purpose of breaking down conventions was to further develop productive forces, therefore, they should break and establish simultaneously. The Bureau's freight department, while abolishing 200 outdated rules and regulations, also established and improved more than 110 rules and regulations to ensure safe train operation and accelerate vehicle turnover, based on the opinions of the masses and the needs of production. For example, according to the previous cargo transportation rules, goods transported from Station A to Stations B and C needed to be re-counted at Station B before being transported to Station C, which not only prolonged the vehicles' dwell time at the station but also easily damaged the goods. After listening to the opinions of cargo owners and loaders, the freight department, with the approval of higher authorities, reformed this system, established a responsibility system to strengthen the dispatch of goods from Station A, and canceled the procedure of counting goods at Station B. As a result, the vehicles' dwell time at the station was shortened by one hour, and the cargo damage rate was greatly reduced. When the Nancang Station revised its operation system, it mobilized technicians and workers to put forward revision opinions based on their own operating experience, and then the station leaders summarized them into five systems to ensure safe train operation, such as regularly inspecting technical equipment and employee protective equipment, and conducting safety production education for new employees, and then submitted them to the masses for discussion and approval. In this way, everyone truly valued the safety assurance system ideologically. In the past year, there has not been a single serious train accident or major casualty. A dedicated line of the Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant used to accommodate only seven railcars for loading and unloading. The local railway department, based on the railcar capacity of this dedicated line, requested to increase one railcar each time to accelerate vehicle turnover. However, the plant was afraid that increasing railcars would prolong the loading and unloading time and be fined by the railway department, so it refused to agree. Last year, the railway department reformed the system of controlling loading and unloading time with economic fines and established a new system of mutual support with the Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant to improve loading and unloading capacity, which rapidly increased the loading and unloading capacity.

In the process of breaking and establishing various systems, the Beijing Railway Bureau has formulated and implemented the following regulations: some conventions belonging to basic-level regulations that do not affect safety and quality are to be resolved by the basic-level; for some systems regulated by the Administration Bureau and the Ministry of Railways, the basic-level must submit opinions to higher authorities for approval; some technical, relatively significant, and quality-safety-related rules and regulations must be approved by relevant higher authorities and tested among the masses before being fully implemented if they prove feasible.

The Bureau has also launched several mass mobilizations to inspect and rectify the situation of breaking and establishing rules and regulations, and to deal with problems in a timely manner. For example, at the end of last year, more than 200 stations under its jurisdiction universally revised the "Station Management Regulations" by relying on the masses during the inspection of the breaking and establishing of systems, consolidating some effective systems for ensuring safe train operation. Moreover, it also established systems for accident analysis, research, and handling, and improved safety supervision correspondents to further ensure safe train operation. When the Beijing Guang'anmen Station broke through outdated rules and regulations, it did not pay attention to establishing and improving some necessary rules and regulations, and there were chaotic phenomena such as "tickets without goods" and "goods without tickets". After the station's employees put forward their opinions, the leadership organized the masses to hold a forum in a timely manner, collectively discussed and formulated seven new systems, including freight yard management, warehouse management, warehouse operations, and accident prevention, to clarify the division of labor, strengthen the individual responsibility system, and overcome the chaotic phenomena in the freight yard.

### 建立新制度  行车保安全  北京铁路局发动群众健全责任制

    建立新制度  行车保安全
    北京铁路局发动群众健全责任制
    新华社17日讯　北京铁路局在发动群众破除一些束缚生产的陈规以后，先后健全和建立了一些新制度，来保证行车的安全和促进生产力的发展。
    在局党委统一领导下，去年上半年，这个局曾先后展开两次规模较大的“破陈规建新制”的运动。当职工群众猛攻陈规时，局党委及时向群众提出破除陈规的目的是为了进一步发展生产力，因此，应该做到有破有立。这个局货运部门在废除二百件陈旧的规章制度时，又根据群众的意见和生产的需要，建立和健全了一百一十多件保证行车安全、加速车辆周转的规章制度。例如，按照以往的货物运输规则，由甲站运往乙、丙两个车站的货物，到达乙站后，需要重新清点运往丙站货物的件数，不仅延长了车辆在车站的停留时间，而且容易损坏货物。货运部门听取货主和装卸工人的意见后，经过上级批准，改革了这项制度，建立了加强甲站发货的责任制度，取消了乙站清点货物的手续。实行结果，车辆在车站的停留时间缩短了一小时，货物损坏率大大降低了。南仓车站在修改作业制度时，发动技术人员和工人，根据自己的操作经验，提出修改意见，然后由车站领导上综合归纳成定期检查技术设备和职工防护用品、对新职人员进行安全生产教育等五项保证安全行车的制度，再交群众讨论通过。这样，就使大家对保证安全制度真正从思想上重视起来，一年以来，没有发生过一次恶性以上行车事故和重大伤亡事故。宣化铁厂的一条专用线，过去一直只容七个车皮装卸，当地的铁路部门根据这条专用线的容车量，要求每次增加一个车皮来加速车辆周转。但是这个厂怕增加车皮会延长装卸时间，被铁路部门罚款，不肯答应。去年铁路部门改革了用经济罚款控制装卸时间的制度，和宣化铁厂订立相互支援以提高装卸能力的新制度，使装卸能力迅速提高。
    北京铁路局在破立各项制度的过程中，曾经作出并贯彻了下列规定：对一些属于基层规定的、对安全质量没有影响的陈规，由基层负责解决；对一些属于管理局和铁道部规定的制度，基层提出意见，必须报上级批准；对一些带有技术性的、比较重大的和有关质量安全的规章制度，必须经有关上级批准，并在群众中先行试验后，证明可行才全面实行。
    这个局还几次发动群众对规章制度破立的情况，进行检查和整顿，发现问题，及时处理。如去年年底，所属的二百多个车站在检查制度破立情况时，依靠群众普遍修订了“车站管理细则”，把一些保证安全行之有效的制度固定下来，而且，还建立了对事故分析研究处理、健全安全监察通讯员等制度，来进一步保证行车安全。北京广安门车站在冲破陈旧的规章制度时，由于没有重视建立和健全一些必要的规章制度，曾经发生“有票无货”，“有货无票”等混乱现象。车站的职工提出意见后，领导上及时组织群众开座谈会，集体讨论和制订了货场管理、仓库管理、仓库作业、防止事故等七项新制度，做到了分工明确，加强了个人责任制，克服了货场的混乱现象。
