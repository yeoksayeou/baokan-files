    Guanghua Lumber Mill Uses Chemical Processing Methods to Fully Utilize Wood
    Sawdust Becomes Important Industrial Raw Material
    (Our report) Beijing Guanghua Lumber Mill utilizes chemical processing and other methods to fully utilize sawdust, so that the wood utilization rate can be increased to more than 97%.

    This comprehensive wood processing factory processes over one hundred thousand cubic meters of logs annually, leaving a large amount of by-products and scraps. In the past few years, this factory has established specialized workshops to process some of the scrap wood, firewood, shavings, etc., into furniture or semi-finished products, and the wood utilization rate has increased from 50% to over 80%. However, all the sawdust was still treated as waste.

    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the factory's workers have analyzed the plant's waste utilization and studied the utilization of sawdust, which accounts for about 10% of the processing residue. While actively using waste materials to produce artificial boards, they have adopted chemical processing methods to fully utilize sawdust. They used the "normal pressure dilute acid hydrolysis method" to produce alcohol from sawdust. Experiments have proved that about sixteen tons of sawdust can produce one ton of alcohol. They also used the "fluidized bed carbonization activation" method to produce 1.5 tons of activated carbon from about twenty tons of sawdust. In addition, they also made bakelite powder. These products are all very important industrial raw materials.

    光华木材厂用化学加工方法充分利用木材
    锯末变成重要工业原料
    本报讯　北京市光华木材厂采用化学加工等办法充分利用锯末，使木材利用率可以提高到97％以上。
    这个综合性的木材加工厂每年加工十几万立方公尺原木，剩下大量副料、碎料。过去几年，这个厂设立专业工段，把一部分碎木料、劈柴、刨花等加工成家具或半成品，木材利用率由50％提高到80％以上。但是，全部锯末仍旧当废料处理了。
    去年大跃进以来，这个厂的职工分析了全厂利用废料的情况，对大约占加工剩余物10％的锯末的利用问题进行了研究。他们在积极用废材废料生产人造板的同时，采用化学加工的办法来充分利用锯末。他们用“常压稀酸水解法”，从锯末中制造出了酒精。试验证明，十六吨锯末约可生产一吨酒精。他们还用“沸腾式炭化活化”的办法，从二十吨左右的锯末里生产出一点五吨活性炭。另外，他们还制成了电木粉。这些产品都是很重要的工业原料。
