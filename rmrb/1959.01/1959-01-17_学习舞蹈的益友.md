The newly published "Dance" supplement is a reader that provides dance activity materials, how to learn on your own, and increase knowledge in this area for dance enthusiasts. It plays a certain role in enriching the content of the mass cultural life activities that are currently being widely carried out. It will become a good friend to dance enthusiasts.

Collective dance is a kind of self-entertainment dance creation form that the masses love. For a long time, there has been a lack of new works in this area. The two collective dances "The Noose Around the Neck of American Imperialism" and "The Entire People are Soldiers" compiled by dancer Dai Ailian can just meet some of the needs of the masses in this regard. More and better works of this kind are needed in the future. In some places where there are few or no professional dance workers, amateur dance activists are distressed by their inability to get started and do not know how to exercise. The "Basic Training for Amateur Dance" published in this issue uses concise text and illustrations to discuss this issue, which is also timely and meets practical needs. In addition, the crosstalk dance "Heroic Little Eighth Route Army", the dance stage notes "Corn Acceptance" and the dance knowledge lecture and other articles also enrich the content of this issue in many ways.

    学习舞蹈的益友
    新出版的“舞蹈”副刊，是一本为舞蹈爱好者提供舞蹈活动材料、如何进行自学和增长这方面知识的读物。它对于丰富目前广泛开展的群众文化生活活动内容有着一定的作用。它会成为舞蹈爱好者的一个好朋友。
    集体舞是群众喜爱的自娱性的舞蹈创作形式的一种。很久以来，这方面缺乏新作品。舞蹈家戴爱莲编的“绞索套在美帝脖子上”和“全民皆兵”两个集体舞，正能满足群众对这方面的部分要求。今后还需要更多更好的这一类作品。在一些很少或没有专业舞蹈工作者的地方，业余舞蹈活动积极分子苦于无法入门，不晓得怎样进行锻炼，这一期刊载的“业余舞蹈基本训练”，用简练的文字和图解来谈这个问题，也是及时和切合实际需要的。此外，相声舞蹈“英雄小八路”、舞蹈场记“玉米验收”和舞蹈知识讲座等篇也从多方面丰富了这一期的内容。
