    Increase Production of Light Industrial Goods, Expand Market Supply
    Sichuan Vigorously Develops Light Industry
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 20th dispatch) In 1959, a new and greater leap forward situation emerged in dozens of light industry sectors in Sichuan Province. The province has initially determined that the total output value of light industry will increase significantly compared to last year, and the growth rates of major products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, vegetable oil, and sugar will greatly exceed those of 1958.

    The large-scale development of light industry by the people's communes is a characteristic of Sichuan's development of light industry this year. According to local arrangements, people's communes will focus on textiles, paper making, sugar production, processing of agricultural and sideline products, and comprehensive utilization of rural resources to develop light industry, using local materials, producing locally, and supplying locally. The provincial light industry authorities plan to help communes establish 1,000 small paper mills with a daily output of less than one ton, 1.5 million earthen spinning spindles, and a number of other small factories this year. In the fourth quarter of last year alone, people's communes in various special districts established more than 1,000 small factories in the three industries of papermaking, sugar and alcohol, and silicates. The small paper mills established in places like Santai and Tongliang generally use wood, bamboo, and stone as materials. Commune members use the slack time in agricultural production to manufacture equipment themselves, investing less than 2,000 yuan, and completing construction and putting it into production in as little as half a month. Papermaking raw materials are mainly grass fibers, and low-grade newsprint, cultural paper, packaging paper, and household paper have been produced, recouping the entire investment in a few days. With their own factories, the cultural activities and livelihood needs of the communes' members are satisfied, and large quantities of rice straw, wheat straw, and wild fibers are rationally utilized.

    Urban and special district/county light industry are the backbone of light industry. Currently, all localities are focusing on both production and construction, striving to rapidly expand production capacity. A batch of cotton spinning, hemp spinning, papermaking, and textile machinery manufacturing factories planned to be newly built this year are being organized to accelerate design and start construction in batches. Existing factories are widely mobilizing the masses to further engage in technological revolution, improve production levels, expand varieties, and improve product quality. The textile industry focuses on high quality, high technology, low consumption, and expanding variety, with all-round increases in cotton spinning, wool spinning, hemp spinning, and silk weaving products. The silicate industry plans to produce more than 80,000 tons of industrial ceramics this year, including more than 2,000 sets (units) of major equipment for papermaking, alcohol production, oil extraction, and sugar production. In addition to the mechanical departments having already started processing the equipment needed for the expansion of production in various factories, the light industry factories have organized their own machine repair forces to manufacture indigenous equipment to arm themselves. For products such as small hardware, sewing machines, bicycle parts, batteries, and flashlights, the provincial light industry authorities are organizing factories that have switched to producing other products to return to their original lines, in order to rapidly expand market supply.

### 增产轻工业品　扩大市场供应  四川大办轻工业

    增产轻工业品　扩大市场供应
    四川大办轻工业
    本报成都20日电　1959年四川省几十个轻工业行业出现了一个新的更大跃进的局面。全省初步确定的轻工业产值将比去年增长很多，棉纱、棉布、纸张、植物油、食糖等主要产品增长率都将大大超过1958年。
    人民公社大办轻工业是今年四川发展轻工业的一个特点。根据各地安排，人民公社办轻工业将以纺织、造纸、食糖、农副产品加工以及综合利用农村资源为主，就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。省轻工业主管部门计划今年帮助公社建立日产一吨以下小型纸厂一千个，土纺纱锭一百五十万枚，以及若干其他小型工厂。去年第四季度，各专区人民公社仅造纸、糖酒、硅酸盐三个行业就建立了小型工厂一千多个。在三台、铜梁等地建立的小型纸厂一般都是用木料、竹子、石头做材料，公社社员利用农业生产的间隙时间自己制造设备，投资不到二千元，最多半个月就建成投入生产。造纸原料以草类纤维为主，已生产出低级新闻纸，文化用纸，包装纸和生活用纸，几天就收回了全部投资。公社有了自己的工厂，文化活动和社员生活需要既得到满足，大量的稻草、麦秆、野生纤维又得到合理利用。
    城市和专、县轻工业是轻工业的骨干，目前各地既抓生产，又抓建设，争取迅速扩大生产能力。今年全省计划新建的一批棉纺、麻纺、造纸、纺织机械制造等工厂，已组织力量加速设计和分批动工。现有工厂则广泛发动群众进一步大闹技术革命，提高生产水平，扩大品种，提高产品质量。纺织工业以高质量、高技术、少消耗和扩大花色品种为中心，棉纺、毛纺、麻纺、丝织产品都要全面增产。硅酸盐工业计划今年生产工业用陶瓷八万吨以上，其中包括造纸、酒精、榨油、制糖等主要设备二千多套（台）。各厂扩大生产所需要的设备，除机械部门已着手加工外，各轻工业厂已组织机修力量，制造土设备武装自己。小五金、缝纫机、自行车配件、电池电筒等产品，省轻工业主管部门正组织已改行生产其他产品的工厂归队，以迅速扩大对市场的供应。
