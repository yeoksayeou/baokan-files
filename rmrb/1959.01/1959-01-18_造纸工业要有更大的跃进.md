The paper industry had a great leap forward in 1958. The annual output increased by 35% compared with 1957, greatly exceeding the annual increase rate of 19.4% of paper during the First Five-Year Plan.

However, due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the development of the cultural revolution and technical revolution, the demand for paper in all aspects has increased even faster. According to statistics from nine provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hubei, due to the multiple increase in newspaper and periodical circulation, the demand for newsprint alone this year will increase at least twice as much as last year, greatly exceeding the total output of machine-made paper last year. Paper production must not only meet the needs of news and cultural undertakings, but also meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production technology paper, packaging paper, and people's daily use paper (such as writing paper and toilet paper). This situation requires the paper industry to have a corresponding greater leap forward in 1959, in accordance with the principle of planned and proportionate development, to increase paper production as much as possible, in order to basically meet the demand for paper, and to focus on ensuring the needs of industrial paper and cultural paper.

This year, to achieve a greater leap forward in the paper industry, the primary task is to launch a mass movement and a technical revolution in existing paper-making enterprises. Last year, the paper industry vigorously launched a mass technical revolution movement. Thanks to the hard work and creative efforts of the workers and staff, there have been major technological innovations in every process of paper making, from cooking and pulping to paper making, which has increased the production efficiency of each process by 20% to more than one time compared to before the innovation. For example, in terms of cooking, after adopting strong cooking measures at the beginning of last year, the daily pulp production per cubic meter (volume of the digester) of state-owned paper mills reached 900 kilograms, which has more than doubled compared to the past. Shanghai workers further successfully tested continuous cooking, and the daily production per cubic meter can reach more than two tons, which is more than twice as efficient as using a spherical digester for strong cooking. In terms of pulping, a closed spiral beater has been created, which is five times more efficient than ordinary beaters. In terms of paper making, due to the adoption of technologies such as suction cylinder molds and automatic paper threading, efficiency has been significantly improved. The paper speed of cylinder paper machines has increased from 80 meters per minute to more than 100 meters per minute, and the paper speed of ordinary Fourdrinier paper machines has increased from 170 meters per minute to more than 200 meters per minute. This year, on the basis of this achievement, we should continue to vigorously promote these advanced technologies, and update equipment on the principle of using less or no steel, to meet the requirements of adopting these new technologies, so as to increase production capacity and increase output faster.

Secondly, we must accelerate the progress of capital construction in the paper industry and rapidly increase new paper production capacity. In order to speed up the progress of capital construction, the industrial bureaus of all provinces and cities must firmly grasp the manufacturing of paper-making equipment, actively urge existing paper-making machinery factories to give full play to their production potential and complete their production tasks ahead of schedule, according to the allocation of steel, and vigorously organize the mechanical repair workshops of paper mills and the mechanical manufacturing forces of handicraft cooperative factories to carry out production. In order to save steel, we should produce as much equipment as possible for medium and small paper mills to meet the needs of building factories at the prefectural and county levels. The work of replacing steel with ceramics to manufacture drying cylinders must also be strengthened. While grasping the equipment manufacturing, we must also properly arrange construction and installation forces and do a good job in production preparation, so that the newly built paper mills can be put into production as soon as possible.

While building new large and medium-sized enterprises, running small paper mills in people's communes is an important way to rapidly increase production capacity, solve the current shortage of paper supply, and further rationalize the layout of the paper industry. China has a vast territory and abundant paper-making resources, while existing paper-making enterprises are mostly in cities, and more than 70% of paper production is concentrated in Northeast and East China, resulting in great waste in the round-trip transportation of raw materials and finished products. Since every commune has paper-making raw materials, and paper-making equipment and required materials can be adapted to local conditions, generally people's communes can solve them. Therefore, people's communes can run simple and small paper mills on a large scale. Universally building small paper mills in people's communes is not only short in construction time, small in investment, and quick in results, but also because it is locally sourced, locally produced, and locally sold, it can save a lot of transportation power, reduce costs, and facilitate the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and can also increase the income of the communes. At present, most provinces and cities have launched a wave of building paper mills in every county and every commune. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-four provinces and cities, starting from the fourth quarter of last year and ending at the end of the year, more than 2,000 small paper mills have been built or are under construction across the country, and more than 140 have been officially put into production. This year, we should continue to develop on this basis. If 10,000 of the more than 26,000 people's communes in the country build paper mills, and each paper mill produces half a ton of paper per day, the annual output can be 1.5 million tons. Calculated on the basis of six months of production time, it is also 750,000 tons. This will play a significant role in meeting the needs of people's commune members for cultural and daily use paper.

The policy of people's communes building small paper mills with a daily output of less than two tons should be to rely on the masses, rely on their own efforts, start with indigenous methods, and gradually move from indigenous to modern methods. On the one hand, we should fully utilize and transform the existing manual paper-making production, promote experiences such as hanging curtain paper making and fire wall drying, and gradually move towards continuous production to increase the output and quality of paper. On the other hand, we should also actively adopt a combination of indigenous and modern paper-making equipment with higher efficiency according to local conditions, build new factories, and produce better quality cultural printing and packaging paper. Areas with insufficient pulp can also consider building small indigenous pulp mills. Although the technical requirements for paper production are relatively high, judging from the experience of people's communes building paper mills in various places, the indigenous and modern paper mills, taking the approach of building factories while training technicians, and testing while improving the technical level of workers, do not take a long time from the completion of the factory construction to the official production.

In addition, the shortage of raw materials is the main problem in increasing production at present. The supply of wood, chemical raw materials, copper mesh, and felt is insufficient. Therefore, all paper mills should vigorously reduce the consumption quota of raw materials, try to replace part of the wood pulp with grass pulp, strengthen the recovery of alkali, extend the service life of copper mesh and felt, and strive to find alternative raw materials. At the same time, the industrial bureaus of all provinces and cities and all paper-making enterprises should vigorously organize the production of raw materials needed for paper making, and take a variety of methods such as salt electrolysis, indigenous alkali causticization, and extraction from steel slag according to local resource conditions to develop the production of caustic soda and bleaching powder; actively mine alum mines, and adopt effective methods such as adding sulfuric acid to furnace ash or clay to extract alumina. All major paper-producing areas should establish their own copper mesh factories and felt factories. As for the copper mesh and felt required for commonly used cylinder paper machines, local handicraft production cooperatives that currently produce window screens, sieve bottoms, and blankets should be organized to produce them.

Since the demand for paper is growing rapidly, the current production of paper cannot meet all consumption needs. Therefore, all paper-using units, especially factories and publishing agencies, must vigorously save paper. The consumption of paper and the circulation of publications should be appropriately controlled. We hope that the paper industry department, focusing on launching a technical revolution in old factories and running small paper mills in people's communes, will conscientiously mobilize the masses, continue to exert their energy, and strive for a greater leap forward in paper production in 1959, to meet the needs of all sectors of society for paper.

    造纸工业要有更大的跃进
    1958年，我国的造纸工业有了很大的跃进，全年产量比1957年增加了35％，大大超过了第一个五年计划期间纸张每年递增19.4％的速度。
    但是，由于工农业生产的大跃进和文化革命、技术革命的开展，各方面对纸张的需要量增加得更快。根据北京、上海、江苏、湖北等九个省市的统计，由于报刊发行量成倍地增长，今年对新闻印刷用纸一项的需要量比去年至少增加一倍，大大超过了去年全部机制纸的总产量。而纸张生产不仅要满足新闻文化事业的需要，同时也要满足工农业生产技术用纸和包装用纸以及人民生活用纸（如书写纸、卫生纸）的需要。这种形势，要求造纸工业必须按照有计划按比例发展的原则，在1959年也有相应的更大的跃进，尽一切可能增产纸张，以作到基本上适应对纸张的需求，重点保证工业用纸和文化用纸的需要。
    今年，要实现造纸工业更大的跃进，首要一环，是在现有造纸企业中大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。去年，造纸工业已经蓬勃地开展群众性的技术革命运动。由于职工群众的刻苦钻研和努力创造，造纸的每一个工序，从蒸煮、打浆到抄纸，都有了重大的技术革新，使每一工序的生产效率较革新前提高20％到一倍多。如蒸煮方面，去年年初采用强力蒸煮的措施后，国营造纸厂每日每立方公尺（蒸煮锅的容积）产浆量达到九百公斤，已经比过去翻了一番，而上海职工进一步试验连续蒸煮成功，每日每立方公尺可产浆二吨多，比用蒸球强力蒸煮的效率又提高二倍多。在打浆方面，创造了封闭式螺旋打浆机，效率比普通打浆机提高五倍。抄纸方面，由于采取了抽气式圆网、自动引纸等技术，效率显著提高，圆网造纸机的抄速由每分钟八十公尺提高到一百公尺以上，普通长网纸机的抄速每分钟一百七十公尺，提高到二百公尺以上。今年应当在这一成绩的基础上，继续大力推广这些先进技术，并在少用或不用钢铁的原则下，更新设备，来适应采用这些新技术的要求，以便更快地提高生产能力，增加产量。
    其次，必须加速造纸工业的基本建设进度，迅速地增加新的纸张生产能力。为了加快基本建设进度，各省市工业厅局要抓紧造纸设备的制造工作，根据钢材分配的情况，积极地督促现有造纸机械制造厂，发挥生产潜力，提前完成生产任务，并大力组织造纸厂的机修车间，以及手工业合作工厂的机械制造力量进行生产。为了节约钢材，应当尽可能地多生产中、小型纸厂的设备，满足专区、县一级建厂的需要。以陶瓷代替钢铁、制造烘缸的工作也必须加强。在抓紧设备制造的同时，还必须妥善安排施工和安装力量，做好生产准备工作，使新建纸厂能够尽早投入生产。
    与新建大中型企业的同时，在人民公社中大办小型纸厂是迅速地增加生产能力，解决当前纸张供应不足，和进一步使造纸工业布局趋于合理的重要途径。我国地区辽阔，造纸资源丰富，而现有造纸企业多在城市，70％以上纸张产量又集中于东北和华东，原料和成品往返运输，浪费很大。由于造纸原料社社都有，造纸设备及所需材料可以因地制宜，一般人民公社都可以解决。因此人民公社可以大办简易的、小型的造纸厂。在人民公社普遍建设小型造纸厂，不仅建设时间短、投资小、收效快，而且因为是就地取材、就地生产、就地销售，可以大量的节约运输力量，降低成本，便于原料的综合利用，同时还可以增加公社的收入。目前，多数省市已经开展了县县、社社大办纸厂的热潮。据二十四个省市不完全的统计，从去年第四季度开始，截至年底为止，各地已建成或正在兴建的小型造纸厂已达二千余个，正式投入生产的一百四十余个。今年应当在这一基础上继续发展。全国二万六千多个人民公社，如果其中有一万个人民公社建设了纸厂，每个纸厂日产纸张以半吨计，全年即可有一百五十万吨的产量，按生产时间半年计算，也有七十五万吨。这对于满足人民公社社员文化和生活用纸的需要将起很大作用。
    人民公社建设日产两吨以下的小型纸厂的方针，应当是依靠群众，自力更生，土法上马，由土到洋。一方面充分利用和改造现有手工造纸的生产，推广吊帘抄纸、火墙烘干等经验，逐步走向连续生产，提高纸张的产量和质量。另一方面还要因地制宜，积极采用土洋结合的效率较高的造纸设备，建设新厂，生产质量较好的文化印刷和包装用纸。纸浆不足的地区也可以考虑兴建小型土法纸浆厂。造纸生产的技术要求虽然较高，但从各地人民公社建设纸厂的经验看来，土洋结合的纸厂，采取边建厂、边培训技术人员，边试车、边提高工人技术水平的做法，从建厂完成到正式生产，并不需要很长的时间。
    此外，原材料不足是当前增加生产中的主要问题。木材、化工原料、铜网、毛布等供应不足。因此各纸厂应大力降低原材料消耗定额，尽量用草浆代替部分木浆，加强碱的回收工作，延长铜网、毛布的使用寿命，努力寻找代用原材料。同时，各省市工业厅局和所有的造纸企业，都应该大力组织造纸所需原材料的生产，根据各地资源情况，采取食盐电解、土碱苛化以及从钢渣中提取等多种多样办法，发展烧碱和漂粉的生产；积极开采矾矿，并采用在炉灰或白土中加硫酸提炼矾土等有效的方法。各个主要产纸地区都应当建立自己的铜网厂和毛布厂。至于普遍需要的圆网造纸机所需铜网、毛布，则应就地组织现在生产窗纱、箩底以及毛毯的手工业生产合作社进行生产。
    由于纸张的需要量增长得很快，目前纸张的生产还不能满足全部消费需要，因此所有用纸的单位，特别是工厂和出版机关，必须大力节约用纸，纸张的消耗和出版物的发行额，应加以适当的控制。我们希望，造纸工业部门以在老厂大搞技术革命和在人民公社大办小型纸厂为中心，认真发动群众，继续鼓足干劲，争取1959年纸张生产有更大的跃进，以适应社会各方面对纸张的需要。
