The Great Victory of the Party's Educational Policy and Educational Line
Yang Xiufeng Reports on Educational Work at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units

(Our Newspaper News) Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education of the People's Republic of China, made a report on education work on December 31st at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Socialist Agricultural Construction.

Yang Xiufeng said: "1958 was a year of the greatest socialist construction and overall Great Leap Forward in Chinese history. Along with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a vigorous upsurge of technological and cultural revolutions emerged throughout the country, creating a new situation in which the entire Party and all the people ran education, enabling China's education to achieve unprecedented leaps in development, thus bringing about tremendous changes in the cultural outlook of the vast urban and rural areas."

When talking about the Great Leap Forward in education in 1958, he pointed out that according to preliminary and not very precise statistics: "About 100 million young and middle-aged people across the country have been freed from illiteracy, and more than half of the counties and cities have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people; and on the basis of eliminating illiteracy, various forms of spare-time schools (including spare-time primary schools, middle schools, universities, and Red and Expert schools, cultural and technical schools, etc.) have been established on a large scale. Whether in urban or rural areas, nurseries and kindergartens have greatly developed, with approximately 25 million children enrolled, an increase of more than twenty times compared with 1957. Most counties and cities have basically popularized primary school education, with the average enrollment rate of school-age children across the country reaching over 90%, and the number of students increasing by more than 40% compared with 1957. The number of students in various types of secondary schools (including ordinary middle schools, industrial middle schools, agricultural middle schools, and secondary vocational schools) has doubled compared with 1957. The number of students in universities and colleges has reached more than 700,000, an increase of more than 70% compared with 1957. In particular, with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, rural education has been further enriched and developed. Some communes have established a comprehensive national education system covering children's education, youth education, and various forms of adult education. Education has truly become the cause of the people and has begun to be controlled by the people themselves."

Yang Xiufeng said: "All levels and types of schools have also achieved great success in implementing the Party's educational policy of 'education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor' in recent times. From launching the work-study movement in existing schools to schools running factories and farms on a large scale, and factories and agricultural cooperatives running schools on a large scale, specific forms of combining education with productive labor have been created. Full-time and part-time schools at all levels and types have included productive labor as a formal course, with students studying and working at the same time, effectively participating in various productive labors. The vast number of teachers and students have received profound educational training in ideological and political consciousness, and their thoughts and feelings have undergone great changes. Now, the vast number of young students have begun to develop the habit of participating in productive labor, taking labor as an honor, and greatly improving their communist consciousness. In teaching and scientific research, the past erroneous tendency of seriously separating from politics and reality has been initially reversed. The quality of teaching has significantly improved. Especially in universities and colleges, the reform of teaching and scientific research has achieved unprecedented results due to the implementation of politics taking command and the mass line, giving full play to the collective wisdom and strength of teachers, students, and staff. Ideological movements, teaching reforms, productive labor, and scientific research have formed a new atmosphere of mutual promotion and mutual progress. In this way, students can achieve all-round development in moral, intellectual, and physical education, realizing the requirement of cultivating 'laborers with socialist consciousness and culture' as instructed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao."

Yang Xiufeng pointed out that the great achievements of China's education in 1958 were a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction; a great victory for the Party's educational policy and educational line; and the result of implementing the mass line principle of "walking on two legs" of all the Party and all the people running education, combining unity and diversity, combining popularization and improvement, and combining central leadership and local decentralization. Of course, this is also inseparable from the hard work of millions of comrades engaged in education, and inseparable from the pioneering role and significant contributions made in their work by the representatives of advanced units (including representatives of education work) attending this conference.

Regarding the current tasks of China's education, Yang Xiufeng pointed out: "Education is an important part of the entire socialist construction cause, and it must serve socialist economic construction and the development of production well. The Party and the broad masses of the people's requirements for education work, like production tasks, not only require necessary development but must also consolidate and improve as much as possible on the existing work base. It requires education workers to further implement the Party's educational policy, line, and work principles. There are many new problems to be solved diligently. This is the new situation and new tasks facing education work."

Yang Xiufeng then focused on the issue of rural education. He said: "The broad masses of peasants have deeply felt in practice that in order to further fully develop the productive forces in rural areas, it is necessary to have culture and technology. After freeing themselves from illiteracy, they also urgently demand to improve their cultural and technical levels. To this end, it is necessary to further implement the principle of 'walking on two legs' of combining popularization and improvement. It is necessary to run well kindergartens, full-time middle and primary schools, and part-time schools that cultivate children and young people. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of peasants and continuously improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, it is also necessary to develop, consolidate, and improve various forms of spare-time schools."

Yang Xiufeng said: "In recent months, rural people's communes have run many kindergartens, which not only liberated women's labor but also made preschool education develop towards the direction of social education, which is of great benefit to the cultivation of the new generation. We must run kindergartens well in accordance with the requirements of the 'Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes' of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In order to run nurseries and kindergartens well, the important issue that needs to be resolved at present is to rapidly train nursery workers and teachers. This work should be carried out by adopting various methods according to the policy of combining long-term training and short-term training."

Yang Xiufeng also said that in order to run primary school education well, run full-time ordinary middle schools, part-time agricultural middle schools, and other secondary vocational schools well, it is first necessary to properly arrange teaching and productive labor, ensuring both students' study time and sleep and rest time. This will enable teachers to teach better and students to learn better, so as to continuously improve students' ideological and political awareness, labor views, practical production technology, knowledge, and skills, and improve cultural knowledge levels. Full-time schools should focus on learning, requiring students to learn basic general knowledge well, while also including productive labor as a compulsory course, enabling students to receive labor training and improve their ideological awareness and knowledge levels. Organizing students to carry out productive labor should also be combined with teaching as much as possible, teaching while doing, so as to ensure the completion of the school's entire education plan and improve the quality of teaching. Newly established full-time and part-time schools should pay attention to the work of consolidation and improvement.

Yang Xiufeng also pointed out that the implementation of boarding systems in primary and secondary schools must pay attention to solving the most basic material conditions, such as dormitories, beds, bedding, food, sanitary equipment, etc., and effectively strengthen management work. The commune must also select some young people to apply for senior high schools, secondary vocational schools, and universities in cities in order to train laborers with higher cultural levels for the country and the commune.

Yang Xiufeng also emphasized the importance of adult education in his report. He said: "Implementing universal education among the broad masses of adult laborers and gradually improving the level of education is a major step in making China's working people knowledgeable and gradually narrowing the gap between manual and mental labor, and we should strive to create conditions for it and conduct it seriously. For existing various adult spare-time schools, we should pay attention to the work of consolidation, enrichment, and improvement. Adult education should focus on production and combine production to uniformly arrange labor and study time, and take care of the different requirements of different objects and different situations."

He also pointed out that eliminating illiteracy is an arduous task and we must continue to work hard to consolidate and improve it in order to truly complete this task. To this end, we must strive to develop and run various spare-time cultural and technical schools and Red and Expert schools so that the masses who have gotten rid of illiteracy can continue to improve. These schools are a new type of school. They are the base for cultural and technological revolutions in rural areas and the foundation for the future popularization of education in rural areas. Education administrative departments at all levels must attach importance to, care for, and support these schools, and give practical guidance and help in cultivating teachers, organizing exchanges, compiling teaching materials, and teaching methods.

Yang Xiufeng concluded: "Although education has made great progress in the past year, it is still lagging behind or far from meeting the requirements of the state and the people compared with the high-speed development of production, especially in terms of education quality. According to needs and possibilities, we must pay attention to development with emphasis while also needing to consolidate and improve in a timely manner. We must remember Chairman Mao's instructions, combine soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts and scientific analysis, better implement the Party's policies, and complete the task of cultural revolution."

    党的教育方针和教育路线的伟大胜利
    杨秀峰在全国农业先进单位代表会议上报告教育工作
    本报讯　中华人民共和国教育部部长杨秀峰31日在全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上作了关于教育工作的报告。
    杨秀峰说：1958年，是我国历史上最伟大的社会主义建设全面大跃进的一年。随着工农业生产大跃进，在全国各地出现了蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命和文化革命的高潮，出现了一个全党全民办教育的新局面，使我国教育事业得到了空前的飞跃的发展，从而使广大城乡的文化面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    他在谈到1958年教育事业大跃进的情况时指出，据目前初步不很精确的统计：全国扫除青壮年文盲约一亿人左右，已有半数以上的县市基本上扫除了青壮年文盲；并在扫除文盲的基础上大办各种形式的业余学校（包括业余小学、中学、大学和红专学校、文化技术学校等）。不论城市和农村，托儿所、幼儿园都有了很大的发展，入园幼儿约二千五百万，比1957年增长二十倍以上，大多数县市已经基本上普及了小学教育，全国学龄儿童入学率平均达到了90％以上，学生人数比1957年增加了40％以上。各类中等学校（包括普通中学、工业中学、农业中学、中等专业学校）学生比1957年增加了一倍。高等学校在校学生达到七十多万人，比1957年增加了70％以上。特别是随着农业生产的大跃进和全国农村实现人民公社化以后，农村教育事业更得到新的充实和发展。有些公社已经建立了一个初具规模的包括儿童教育、青年教育和各种形式的成人教育的全民教育体系。教育事业真正成了人民群众的事业，并且开始为人民群众自己所掌握。
    杨秀峰说：各级各类学校在贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育工作方针方面，近来也获得了巨大的成绩。从原有学校开展勤工俭学运动，发展到学校大办工厂、农场，工厂、农业社大办学校，从而创造了教育与生产劳动相结合的具体形式。全日制和半日制的各级各类学校，都已经把生产劳动列为正式课程，学生一面读书，一面做工，实际有效地参加了各种生产劳动。广大师生在思想政治觉悟方面受到了深刻的教育锻炼，思想感情有了很大的变化。现在广大的青年学生对参加生产劳动，已开始养成习惯，以劳动为光荣，共产主义觉悟大大提高。在教学和科学研究工作方面，初步扭转了过去严重脱离政治、脱离实际的错误倾向。教学质量有显著提高。特别是在高等学校中，改革教学、科学研究，由于实现了政治挂帅、群众路线，发挥了师生员工集体智慧和力量，收到了空前未有的成果。思想运动、教学改革、生产劳动、科学研究，形成了互相推动，互相促进的新气象。这样，就使学生在德育、智育、体育几方面得到全面发展，实现党中央、毛主席所指示的培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的要求。
    杨秀峰指出，1958年我国教育事业所以能够取得伟大成就，是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利；是党的教育方针和教育路线的伟大胜利；是贯彻实行了全党全民办教育，统一性与多样性相结合、普及与提高相结合、中央领导与地方分权相结合的“两条腿走路”的群众路线原则所取得的成绩。当然这也是跟千百万从事教育工作的同志辛勤努力分不开的，和出席这次大会的先进单位的代表们（包括教育工作的代表）在工作中所起的先锋作用和显著贡献分不开的。
    关于我国教育工作当前的任务，杨秀峰指出：教育事业是整个社会主义建设事业的重要的组成部分，它必须很好地为社会主义经济建设服务，为发展生产服务。党与广大人民对教育工作的要求，同生产任务一样，不仅是要有必要的发展，还必须尽可能在现有的工作基础上巩固、提高。要求教育工作者进一步的贯彻党的教育方针路线和工作原则，有许多新的问题要努力解决，这就是教育工作所面临的新形势，新任务。
    杨秀峰接着着重谈到了关于农村教育方面的问题。他说：广大农民在实践中已经深刻地感觉到，要使农村的生产力进一步充分地得到发展，就要有文化，有技术。他们在摆脱文盲状态之后，还迫切地要求提高文化、技术水平。为此，必须进一步贯彻普及和提高相结合的“两条腿走路”的原则。要办好培养儿童和青年一代的幼儿园、全日制中、小学和半日制的学校。同时，为了满足广大农民的要求，不断提高他们的政治、文化和技术水平，还必须发展和巩固提高各种形式的业余学校。
    杨秀峰说：最近几个月来，农村人民公社办了很多幼儿园，不仅解放了妇女劳动力，也使幼儿教育向以社会教育为主的方向发展，这对培养新生一代有很大的好处。我们必须按照党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”所要求的那样，把幼儿园办好。为了办好托儿所、幼儿园，当前需要解决的重要问题是迅速培养训练保育员和教师。应该根据长期培养和短期训练并举的方针，采取多种多样的办法来进行这项工作。
    杨秀峰还说，要办好小学教育，办好全日制的普通中学、半日制的农业中学和其他中等职业学校，首先要把教学同生产劳动作恰当的安排，既要保证学生的学习时间，又要保证睡眠时间和休息时间。使教师教得更好，学生学得更好，以达到既能不断提高学生的思想政治觉悟、劳动观点、实际生产技术知识技能，而又能提高文化知识水平。全日制学校应以学习为主，要求学生学好普通基础知识课，同时，把生产劳动作为必修课，使学生受到劳动锻炼，提高思想觉悟与知识水平。组织学生进行生产劳动，还要在可能范围内同教学相结合，一面作，一面教，只有这样，才能很好地保证学校整个教育计划的完成，提高教学质量。新建立的全日制和半日制的学校应该注意巩固提高的工作。
    杨秀峰还指出，中小学实行住宿制，必须注意解决最起码的一些物质条件，如宿舍、床铺、被褥、伙食、卫生设备等等，并且切实加强管理工作。公社还必须选送一部分青年去投考城市里的高级中学、中等专业学校和高等学校，以便为国家和公社培养有较高文化水平的劳动者。
    杨秀峰在报告中还强调指出了成人教育的重要意义，他说：在广大成年的劳动人民中间实行普及教育，并且逐步提高教育水平，这是使我国劳动人民走向知识化、逐步缩小体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别的一个重大步骤，应当努力创造条件，认真进行。对现有各种成人业余学校，应该注意巩固、充实、提高的工作。成人教育要围绕生产、结合生产来统一安排劳动和学习时间，照顾不同对象，不同情况的不同要求。
    他还指出，扫除文盲是一项艰巨的工作，必须继续努力巩固提高，才能真正完成这项任务，为此必须努力发展和办好各种业余文化技术学校、红专学校，使摆脱文盲状态的群众能够不断提高。这些学校是一种新型的学校，它是农村进行文化革命技术革命的基地，也是将来农村普及教育的基础，各级教育行政部门，都必须重视、关心和支援这类学校，从培养师资、组织交流编选教材和教学方法等经验方面给予切实的指导和帮助。
    杨秀峰最后说：一年来，教育事业虽然取得了巨大的进展，可是这同高速度发展的生产相比，同国家和人民的要求相比，还是落后的或者相差很远的，特别是在教育质量上。要根据需要与可能，既适当注意有重点地发展，更需要及时的巩固提高工作。要记住毛主席的指示，把冲天干劲和实事求是的科学分析的精神结合起来，更好地贯彻党的方针政策，完成文化革命的任务。
