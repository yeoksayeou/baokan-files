    Speed Up the Repair of Small Farm Tools and Strive for Production Initiative
    Chen County Organizes Forces to Use Local Iron and Regularly Complete Plans
    (Our dispatch) The Chen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province, in order to adapt to the great development of agriculture and the needs of the masses' lives, has organized specialized processing factories (groups) to vigorously manufacture and repair small farm tools and household utensils. From the end of November last year to the present, the county has manufactured and repaired more than 20,000 pieces of small farm tools such as hoes and iron rakes, manufactured and repaired more than 5,700 small iron pots and tripods, and also manufactured more than 25,000 rain hats and straw capes. It is expected that by the end of February, the county's need for small farm tools and utensils can be basically resolved.
    When the Chen County Committee turned to focusing on agricultural production at the end of November last year, it discovered a new situation: all localities felt that small farm tools were insufficient, and commune members also lacked small utensils. The reasons are: First, with the implementation of collective living, women's labor has been greatly liberated, and the number of workers has increased significantly. According to county-wide statistics, since communization, the number of people in the county participating in agricultural production has increased by about 30%, so the demand for small farm tools has also increased. Second, during the nationwide campaign to run the iron and steel industry, the vast majority of ironworkers and carpenters in the county were invested in the battle to support iron and steel production, and the production of small farm tools and utensils was temporarily suspended. Third, the tool loss rate has increased. Hoes are used to dig ore during iron smelting; hoes are used to dig hard fields during deep plowing, and about 10% of the tools in the county have been damaged. Fourth, the safekeeping work in some areas has not been done well enough, and farm tools have also suffered some losses.
    In response to these situations, the county committee has successively held three telephone conferences of commune party committee secretaries and issued two instructions, requiring all communes to actively establish small farm tool and utensil processing groups or factories, and also determined a deputy secretary to be specifically responsible for leadership. Each commune also designated a deputy secretary to take charge, and each production brigade had a deputy brigade leader in charge. The county has organized a total of 296 ironworkers, 500 carpenters, and more than 600 bamboo weavers to form a number of specialized groups and factories responsible for processing and repairing. The Qiaokou Commune originally had nine iron furnaces and twenty-eight ironworkers, concentrated in the commune's office location to work. Now, in addition to keeping three furnaces, each of the six brigades has been assigned a furnace, which can be processed and repaired locally. In addition, according to the production of raw materials, a household utensil processing factory and two rain gear processing groups were organized with the participation of bamboo weavers.
    In terms of raw materials, Chen County produced more than 300 tons of local steel last year while completing the state's pig iron production tasks; the county also allocated twelve local furnaces to produce pig iron for the manufacture of small farm tools and utensils. At the same time, it vigorously mobilized and relied on the masses to collect scrap steel and iron and find substitutes. For example, Qiaokou Commune used rice straw, bamboo shoots, and old oiled paper to make many straw capes. Another way to solve the difficulty of raw material supply is to clean up tool warehouses to make the most of everything. Some tools only need to be cleaned up to be used, and those that need to be returned to the furnace are returned in time, which saves both materials and labor.
    The people's communes in Chen County have also educated commune members on cherishing public property and keeping their own small farm tools in good condition. After communization, some commune members mistakenly believed that their small farm tools were useless and that the commune would allocate them; in addition, some public property was not kept by special personnel. On January 10, the Aoshang Commune organized a spring plowing inspection team of more than 200 cadres and masses, and they made the inspection of safekeeping and care of farm tools an inspection item. Through discussion, the commune selected eighteen commune members to be responsible for keeping tools, vacated houses to store tools, and formulated a reward system and a responsibility system of "one guarantee (guarantee to the end), one unification (large farm tools are uniformly managed by the brigade), and four haves (tool receipts, storage rooms, account registration, and inspections)."

    赶修小农具生产争主动
    郴县组织力量，利用土铁，定期完成计划
    本报讯　中共湖南省郴县县委为了适应农业大发展和群众生活需要，组织专业加工厂（组），大力赶制、修理小农具和家庭小用具。从去年11月底到目前止，全县已经制造和修配了锄头、铁耙等小农具二万多件，制造和修补了小铁锅、鼎锅五千七百多口，还制造了斗笠、蓑衣二万五千多件。预计2月底，全县需用的小农具、小用具可以基本得到解决。
    郴县县委在去年11月底转入大抓农业生产的时候，发现了一个新的情况：各地感到小农具不足，社员也缺少小用具。原因是：一、实行生活集体化，妇女劳力大大解放，出工人数显著增加。根据全县统计：公社化以后，全县出工参加农业生产的人数增加了30％左右，因此小农具的需要量也增加了。二、在全民大办钢铁工业时，全县绝大部分铁工木工投入了支援钢铁生产的战斗，暂时停止了小农具、小用具的生产。三、工具损耗率增加。炼铁的时候，挖矿石用锄头；深耕的时候，用锄头挖板田，全县约有10％左右的工具被损坏了。四、部分地区保管工作做得不够好，农具也多少有些损失。
    针对这些情况，县委先后召开了三次公社党委书记电话会，并且发了两次指示，要求各公社积极建立小农具和小用具加工组或加工厂，还确定一个副书记具体负责领导，各个公社也确定了一个副书记抓，生产大队有一个副大队长管。全县共组织了二百九十六个铁工，五百个木工，六百多个篾工，成立了若干个专业小组和工厂，负责加工修理。桥口公社原来有九个铁炉、二十八个铁工，集中在公社办公所在地工作。现在除留下三个炉子外，六个大队都分配了一个炉子，可以就地加工，就地修理。另外还根据原料的生产情况，组织了篾工参加的生活小用具加工厂和两个雨具加工组。
    在原材料方面，郴县去年在完成国家生铁生产任务的同时，还炼出了三百多吨土钢；县里又拨出十二座土炉子为制造小农具小用具生产生铁。同时大力发动和依靠群众收集废钢废铁和找代用品。比如桥口公社就利用稻草、笋壳、旧油纸制出蓑衣多件。解决原料供应困难的另一个办法是，清理工具仓库，做到物尽其用。有的工具只需要收拾一下就可以使用，需要回炉的便及时回炉，这样既省料又省工。
    郴县各人民公社还对社员进行爱护公共财产和保管好自己小农具的教育。公社化以后，有些社员错误的认为自己的小农具不顶用了，公社会有配给；另外有部分公共财产也无专人保管。坳上公社1月10日组织了二百多干部、群众参加的备耕检查团，他们把检查保管、爱护农具作为一项检查内容。通过讨论，全社选定了十八个社员负责保管工具，腾出房子装工具，并制订了奖励制度和一包（包到底）、一统（大农具统一由大队管理）、四有（领农具有领条、有保管室、有账目登记、有检查）的责任制。（欧阳贤、张芷生）
