Good Implementation of Educational Policy Results in Great Improvement in Student Learning: Beijing Mining Institute's Examination Scores Improve

(Our dispatch) Beijing Mining Institute students are confidently undertaking their first end-of-term exams after the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor. Scoring results show a significant improvement in student performance this semester.

Currently, the second and third-year students of the Institute have completed all their examinations. According to the school's statistics, compared to the performance of students in the same year in the previous semester, the exam results for these students in four subjects—Physics, Theoretical Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials, and Principles of Electrical Engineering—show that the percentage of students scoring a 5 increased from 27.9% in the previous semester to 48.6%, the percentage scoring a 4 increased from 34.7% to 35.7%, the percentage scoring a 3 decreased from 28.1% to 12.5%, and the percentage scoring a 2 decreased from 9.3% to 3.2%.

Regarding the exam questions this time, Sun Deyan, Associate Professor and Director of the Physics Teaching and Research Group at the Institute, said that when setting the questions, the Teaching and Research Group considered measuring whether students had mastered the most basic and essential content of the courses. Each student had to answer four theoretical questions and four calculation questions, and the quality of the questions was not lower than in previous years.

During a post-examination discussion on this achievement, some teachers and students at Beijing Mining Institute believed that the good examination results were a consequence of earnestly implementing the Party's educational policy over the past year. Students not only learned theoretical knowledge in the classroom but also acquired rich practical knowledge through productive labor. Sensory knowledge and theoretical knowledge were mutually verified, and the learning effect was greatly improved. Some students in Class 5 of the third year of the Mining Electrical Engineering Department originally found it challenging to learn the Principles of Electrical Engineering. When the teacher explained the theory of the three-phase AC generating rotating magnetic field, they drew diagrams and gestured how the coils rotated. However, due to a lack of sensory knowledge, the students still did not fully understand it. After the students spent one day a week working in the motor factory, they quickly understood the theoretical concepts they hadn't fully grasped and mastered knowledge of the motor's structure and the function of each component. To gradually realize the semi-mechanization of the cement factory they were running, students in the Mining Machinery Department and the Mining Construction Department naturally applied theories from Theoretical Mechanics and Mechanics of Materials during the design and manufacturing of ball mills, grinding machines, and mixers. Therefore, when they studied these courses again, it was much easier than before.

As a result of combining education with productive labor, many classes that excelled in both labor and study emerged throughout the school. The third-year, Class 3 students of the Mining Machinery Manufacturing major were rated as a Red Banner class for their work in the self-run oil-bearing bearing factory and steelmaking movement. They also achieved excellent results in this examination, with more than 77% of the students scoring 4 or 5, except for one student who failed one course.

### 教育方针贯彻好　学生学习收效大  北京矿业学院考试成绩提高

    教育方针贯彻好　学生学习收效大
    北京矿业学院考试成绩提高
    本报讯　北京矿业学院学生正满怀信心地进行贯彻教育同生产劳动相结合的方针以后的第一次期终考试。评分的情况表明，这学期学生的成绩有了显著的提高。
    现在，这个学院二、三年级学生已经全部考试完毕。据学校的统计，这些学生物理学、理论力学、材料力学、电工原理四门课的考试成绩，与前一学期同年级学生的成绩相比，得五分的由前一学期的27.9％提高到48.6％，得四分的由34.7％提高到35.7％，得三分的由28.1％下降到12.5％，得二分的由9.3％下降到3.2％。
    关于这次考试的试题，这个学校的物理教研组主任孙德兗副教授说，教研组在出题时，考虑到要通过这次考试来衡量学生是否掌握了课程中最基本、最主要的内容，每个学生须答复理论题、计算题各四个，试题的质量比往年并没有降低。
    北京矿业学院部分师生在考试后座谈这方面的收获时认为，取得这样良好的考试成绩，是一年来认真贯彻执行了党的教育方针的结果。学生们不仅在课堂上学习了理论知识，也通过生产劳动，学到了丰富的实际知识，感性知识和理论知识相互得到印证，学习效果就大有提高。矿山电机系三年级五班有些学生原来学电工原理感到很吃力，教师在讲三相交流产生旋转磁场的理论时，一面画图，一面比划线圈怎样转动，但学生们由于缺乏感性知识，还是理解得不透。当学生每周有一天时间在电机厂进行劳动以后，对这部分没有学透的理论很快就理解了，并且掌握了电机的构造、各部件的作用等方面的知识。矿山机械系和矿山建筑系学生为了使自己兴办的水泥厂逐步实现半机械化，在设计制造球磨机、磨片机、搅拌机过程中，很自然地运用了理论力学、材料力学等方面的理论，因此当他们再学这些课程时就比过去容易得多了。
    由于教育同生产劳动相结合，全校涌现出不少劳动好、学习好的班级。矿山机械制造专业三年级三班学生在自办含油轴承厂和炼钢运动中，被学校评为红旗班，这次考试中也取得了优良的成绩，全班除一个学生有一门课未及格以外，77％以上的学生获得了四分和五分。
