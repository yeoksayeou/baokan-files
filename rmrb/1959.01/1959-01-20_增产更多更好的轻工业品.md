(Reported by our newspaper from Guangzhou on January 19th) Guangzhou City, while ensuring the production of key materials, is taking measures to vigorously increase the production of daily necessities.

The total output value of daily necessities in Guangzhou City last year increased by 79% compared to 1957, but it still cannot meet the growing needs of various places inside and outside the province. The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to vigorously strengthen the production of daily necessities based on needs and possibilities. In addition to instructing relevant departments to allocate more raw materials to relevant factories, the Municipal Committee stipulates that factories producing essential daily necessities, such as match factories and soap factories, factories producing popular daily necessities, and factories producing unique products, shall not switch to producing other commodities. These measures ensure that these factories can continue and expand the production of their original commodities.

The industrial and commercial departments of Guangzhou City that directly produce and supply daily necessities are working together to take many measures to strengthen the production of daily necessities. More than eight hundred factories under the Guangzhou Municipal Light Industry Bureau are using the method of mobilizing the masses to carry out large-scale technological innovations to double the production of existing enterprises. At present, industries such as rubber shoes, flashlights, light bulbs, sweets and biscuits, and small hardware are promoting the use of mechanization and semi-mechanization to replace manual operations, striving to greatly increase output. For example, flashlight production, which is already the highest in the country, will more than double this year on the basis of essentially the same equipment, reaching more than 42 million units. Soap production this year will be more than 11,000 tons, more than double that of last year. Toothpaste production this year will also be more than one and a half times that of last year. In addition, earth-method paper mills, synthetic rubber factories, and glass factories will be established, so as to increase output in a very short time. Regarding the raw materials necessary for the production of certain commodities, such as soda ash, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid, the relevant industrial and commercial departments will establish some factories of this kind themselves this year, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in raw materials.

At present, Guangzhou City is doing everything possible to increase the production of daily commodities. The total amount of daily necessities supplied to the city and other places in the first quarter of this year will increase by about 40% compared to the same period last year.

(Reported by our newspaper from Xi'an on January 19th) Xi'an City is actively organizing cooperation between industrial and commercial departments to produce various small commodities.

At present, factories are actively organizing trial production and production of various small commodities according to the product needs list put forward by the commercial departments. The commercial departments are signing contracts with various factories, making advance payments, and actively helping to solve equipment and raw material problems. Up to now, the commercial departments have prepaid more than 930,000 yuan of order payments to fifty-one factories (cooperatives). The commercial departments also go to the people's communes to organize raw material production and procurement, and carry out waste product recovery.

In organizing the production of small commodities, factories first tap the potential of existing enterprises, and under the premise of not hindering the original production tasks, adopt self-made indigenous equipment and carry out technological innovations to expand production, and make full use of the factory's leftovers or waste materials to self-produce small commodities. The auxiliary workshop of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory will use leftovers to produce 100,000 sets of iron stationery such as compasses, iron clips, and stationery boxes. The metrology factory produces wooden stationery such as meter sticks and T-squares. Attempts are being made to restore those that were able to produce small commodities but later stopped production due to factory mergers. Some newly built street factories and rural commune factories have also uniformly arranged the production of various small commodities according to their own capabilities.

After unified planning and arrangement, the variety of small commodities in Xi'an City has greatly increased compared to last year. Shoe nails, hairpins, eyelets, etc., which could not be produced locally in the past, can basically be self-sufficient, and dip pens, rickshaw bars, etc. can also support other provinces.

According to Heilongjiang Daily, the industrial and commercial departments of Harbin City organized light industrial factories throughout the city to combine manual operation with mechanical operation, and earth methods with foreign methods, to produce daily necessities in large quantities. For example, in sugar production, in addition to fully leveraging the production potential of existing sugar factories, it has also been decided to open forty simple earth sugar factories to meet the market's need for sugar. Nangang District launched a "Hundred Products Movement", with the entire district's industry, commerce, and academia combining and cooperating to manufacture machines for producing earth paper. Harbin Pigment Factory successfully trial-produced barium hydroxide in three days, helping to solve the problems in earth method papermaking. As of the 14th, Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory has produced 18,890,000 tablets and 1,280,000 ampoules; trial-produced and produced three new drugs; 700 grams of chlortetracycline have been produced by earth methods, 300 bottles of antipyretic and anti-inflammatory "Aidazole" have been produced, and 600 bottles of pediatric medicine Antelope Essence have also been produced. The employees of Songhua River Food Chemical Factory are doing everything possible to expand the variety of pickles. In the past ten days, they have produced more than eighty kinds and more than two hundred tons of various pickles, and they can also produce eighty tons of vinegar before the Spring Festival. Songjiang Knitting Factory rushed to produce knitwear urgently needed by the people. According to statistics as of the 14th, 19,155 dozens of sweaters, autumn clothes, etc. have been produced.

(Reported by our newspaper from Changchun on January 19th) Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan and other cities in Jilin Province are mobilizing the masses to do everything possible to produce more and better daily necessities to supply the rapidly growing needs of the people.

When arranging production in the first quarter, the light industry departments of these cities all attached importance to the production of daily necessities that are urgently needed in the current market. The output of most of the ninety-seven main products planned to be produced in Changchun City in the first quarter has greatly increased compared to the actual output in the fourth quarter of last year. For example, paper increased by 45%, various injections increased by 94%, and major foods such as daily-use ceramics, agricultural veterinary drugs, and dim sum breads and dairy products have also increased. The total output value of light industry in Liaoyuan City in the first quarter will increase by 80.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Siping City plans to produce 3,600 tons of soap this year, an increase of 38.8% compared to the actual completed quantity last year.

Various cities mobilized the masses and took measures to overcome the shortage of raw materials. For example, Changchun No. 8 Rubber Factory decided to use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to produce synthetic rubber by itself, and the annual output can provide at least 500,000 pairs of sneakers. At the same time, under the premise of ensuring product quality, waste materials and substitute raw materials are used. For example, Siping Grease Chemical Factory uses waste oil and substitute raw material acidic clay to produce soap, and Changchun's glass factory and agricultural veterinary drug factory use ordinary lime instead of light lime and heavy carbon instead of starch, and the effect is very good. In addition, Changchun City also signed contracts with nearby counties to transport in raw materials such as crude oil, calcium carbide, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, earth sugar and alcohol.

The light industry departments of various cities actively tap the production potential of light industrial factories and build some urgently needed daily necessities factories. Jilin City No. 2 Chemical Factory has prepared raw materials for the production of cosmetics in the first quarter. Recently, the highest daily output of the toothpaste production team has increased by more than double, and the daily output of vanishing cream has also increased by 50%. Many newly built small light industry factories in various cities have started production. A large number of products produced by the newly built furniture, bamboo ware, small hardware, and children's toy factories in Changchun City have met with the general public. Changchun City did not have a battery factory before. Not long ago, the commercial department newly established a battery factory, which plans to produce 141,000 dozen batteries this year to supply market needs.

(Reported by our newspaper from Fuzhou on January 19th) The match industry department in Fujian Province produces a large number of match materials that are shipped to Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hong Kong and other places.

Fujian is rich in match materials. Recently, relevant industrial departments rushed to produce more than 1,410 tons of high-quality match stems and more than 106 million sets of inner and outer box pieces for various places.

Last year, the match industry in Fujian Province had great development, and the product quality also improved significantly. The staff of Fuzhou Huaguang Match Factory made full use of production equipment, and the daily output of matches has increased from 1,200 pieces in December last year to 2,000 pieces.

    增产更多更好的轻工业品
    广州：八百工厂争取生产加番
    西安：工商部门协作组织生产
    哈尔滨：大力增产食糖纸张药品
    吉林：找原料、挖潜力、办新厂福　建：突击生产大批火柴材料
    本报广州19日电　广州市在保证重点物资生产的同时，采取措施大力增产日用百货商品。
    广州市去年日用百货商品的总产值比1957年增长了79％，但是还不能满足省内外各地日益增长的需要。中共广州市委已决定根据需要和可能，大力加强日用必需品的生产。市委除了指示有关部门增拨原料给有关工厂外，并且规定了生产生活必需品的厂如火柴厂和肥皂厂，和出产受群众欢迎的日用百货商品的厂，以及生产独家产品的工厂，一律不能转生产别的商品。这些措施保证了这些厂能够继续和扩大原来百货商品的生产。
    广州市直接生产和供应日用百货商品的工业和商业部门通力合作，采取了许多加强日用百货生产的措施。广州市轻工业局所属的八百多家工厂，正用发动群众大搞技术革新的办法来使现有企业生产翻一番。现在，胶鞋、电筒、电珠、糖果饼干和小五金等行业正在推行以机械化和半机械化来代替手工操作，争取大大提高产量。如产量已为全国第一的电筒今年要在基本上是原有设备的基础上比去年多生产出一倍的电筒来，达到四千二百多万支。肥皂今年将生产一万一千多吨，为去年的一倍多。今年牙膏的产量也要比去年多一倍半左右。此外，还要以土法为主，兴办纸厂、合成橡胶厂和玻璃厂等，以便在很短时间内增加产量。生产某些百货商品必需的原料，如纯碱、烧碱、硫酸、盐酸等，各有关工商业部门将在今年内自己兴办一些这类的工厂，逐步做到自行解决原料的来路问题。
    目前，广州市正在千方百计增产日用商品，在今年第一季度供应本市和外地的日用百货商品的总量，将要比去年同期增长40％左右。
    本报西安19日电　西安市积极组织工业和商业部门协作，进行各种小百货商品的生产。
    现在，各工厂正根据商业部门提出的产品需要单，积极组织试制和生产各种小商品。商业部门正在和各厂签订合同，预付货款，主动帮助解决设备和原料问题。到目前为止，商业部门已经向五十一个厂
  （社）预付了九十三万多元订货款。商业部门还到人民公社组织原料生产和收购，开展废品回收工作。
    各工厂在组织小商品生产中，首先挖掘现有企业的潜力，在不妨碍原生产任务条件下，采取自制土设备，开展技术革新来扩大生产，并且充分利用本厂的下脚料或废料自制小商品。西安人民搪瓷厂附属车间要利用下脚料生产十万件圆规，铁夹、文具盒等铁质文具。度量衡厂生产米尺、丁字尺等木质文具。原来能够生产小商品而后来因并厂停止生产的设法恢复。一些新建的街巷小工厂和农村公社小工厂也都根据自己的力量统一安排了各种小百货的生产。
    经过统一规划和安排后，西安市小商品的品种已比去年大大增加，过去当地不能生产的鞋钉、发卡、气眼等都可基本上自给，蘸水钢笔、人力车条等还可以支援外省。
    据黑龙江日报消息　哈尔滨市工商部门组织全市各轻工业工厂实行手工操作与机械操作相结合，土法生产和洋法生产相结合，大量生产日用品。如食糖生产，除充分发挥现有糖厂生产潜力外，同时还决定开办四十个简易的土糖厂，以满足市场对食糖的需要。南岗区掀起了
  “百种产品运动”，全区工、商、学大结合、大协作制造生产土纸的机器。哈尔滨颜料厂用三天时间试制成功氢氧化钡，帮助解决了土法造纸中的难题。哈尔滨化学制药总厂，截至14日止，已经生产了片剂一千八百八十九万片，针剂一百二十八万支；试制与生产了三种新药品；用土法制作的金霉素已生产了七百克，解热消炎的“爱大唑”生产了三百瓶，还生产了小儿用药羚羊精六百瓶。松花江食品化学厂的职工们，千方百计地扩大酱菜品种，十几天来已经生产了八十多种、二百多吨各种酱菜，春节前还可生产出八十吨醋。松江针织厂赶制人民所急需的针织品，截至14日的统计，已生产出绒衣、秋衣等一万九千一百五十五打。
    本报长春19日电　吉林省长春、吉林、四平、辽源等城市，正在发动群众千方百计地生产更多更好的生活日用品，供应人民群众迅速增长的需要。
    这些城市的轻工业部门在安排第一季度生产时，都重视了当前市场急需的日用品生产。长春市在第一季度计划生产的九十七种主要产品产量，绝大部分都比去年第四季度实际产量有很大增加。如纸增加45％，各种针剂增加94％，日用陶瓷、农兽药以及点心面包、乳品等主要食品也都有增加。辽源市第一季度轻工业总产值将比去年第四季度增长80.3％。四平市今年计划生产肥皂三千六百吨，比去年实际完成数量提高38.8％。
    各城市发动群众，采取措施，克服原材料不足的困难。如长春第八橡胶厂决定用土洋结合办法自制合成橡胶，全年的产量最低可供生产五十万双球鞋用。同时，在保证产品质量的条件下，利用废料和代用原料。如四平油脂化工厂利用废料油和代用原料酸性粘土生产肥皂，长春市的玻璃厂和农兽药厂用普通石灰代替轻石灰、用重炭代替淀粉等，效果都很好。此外长春市还与附近各县订合同运进原油、电石、烧碱、硫酸、土糖和酒精等原料。
    各城市轻工业部门积极挖掘轻工业工厂的生产潜力，新建一些急需的日用品工厂。吉林市第二化工厂，已为第一季度的化妆品生产做好了原材料的准备，最近牙膏生产小组的最高日产量提高一倍多，雪花膏日产量也提高了50％。各城市已有不少新建的小型轻工业工厂开始了生产。长春市最近新建的家具、竹器、小五金、儿童玩具等工厂生产的大量产品，已与广大群众见面。长春市以前没有电池厂，不久之前商业部门新办一座电池厂，今年计划生产十四万一千打电池，供应市场需要。
    本报福州19日电　福建省火柴工业部门生产大批火柴材料源源运往上海、江苏、湖北、湖南、浙江、安徽和香港等地。
    福建盛产火柴材料，最近有关工业部门突击为各地生产了质量很好的火柴梗枝一千四百一十多吨，内外盒片一亿零六百多万套。
    去年福建省火柴工业有了很大发展，产品质量也有显著的提高。福州华光火柴厂职工充分利用生产设备，火柴的日产量已由去年12月份的一千二百件增加到二千件。（附图片）
