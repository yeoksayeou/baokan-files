    Pay Attention When Choosing Toys!
    Ji Xin, Beijing Toy Factory
    I am a toy designer, and I was very excited after reading "More Good Toys Should Be Made" published in "Cultural Street Corner" on January 15. I am willing to accept Comrade Qin Li's suggestions and work hard to improve toy design. At the same time, I would also like to offer some suggestions to parents who purchase toys.
    I often see customers in department stores looking hesitant when buying toys, unsure which one is best. In fact, since toys can help educate children, the first requirement is that we have a relatively correct understanding of our own children. Due to the differences in children's age, gender, habits and interests, it is most important to choose toys according to their different characteristics and needs. For children around two years old who have just learned to walk, they often develop a feeling of boredom with walking and are used to being held by adults. At this time, a colorful and sound-making pull-along toy can help us. It can quickly make children feel good about walking. For children a little over one year old who often do not like to take a bath, we can buy them a brightly colored toy that can float freely on the water, such as a little swan or a little mandarin duck... and put it in the bathtub. In this way, they will gradually become interested in water and enjoy taking a bath. For girls aged four to five who are relatively lazy and do not pay much attention to hygiene, a rag doll is the best educational tool for them. By helping the doll put on clothes and socks, comb its hair, and bathe and wash clothes for the doll every few days, they will gradually develop habits of cleanliness and love of labor.

    挑选玩具要注意！
    北京玩具厂　吉信
    我是一个玩具设计工作者，读了1月15日“文化街头”内发表的“多做些好玩具”后，非常兴奋。我愿意接受秦犁同志的意见，努力改进玩具设计工作，同时也对选购玩具的父母们作一些建议。
    我常在百货公司里看到顾客们购买玩具时，面对着各式各样的玩具常常表现出犹豫不决的神情，不知选哪一种最好。其实既然玩具能帮助教育孩子，首先要求我们对自己的孩子有比较正确的认识。由于孩子年龄，性别的差异，习性与爱好也就有所不同，因此，最主要的是按照孩子们不同的特点和需要来选择玩具。在两周岁左右刚刚学会走路的孩子，时常会对走路发生厌倦心理，习惯于让大人抱着，这时，有声又有色的拖拉式玩具，就会来帮我们的忙，它很快就能使孩子对走路发生好感。像一周岁多一些的孩子，往往不爱洗澡，这样，我们就可以替他购买一个色彩鲜艳的能在水上自由浮动的玩具，如小天鹅，小鸳鸯……放在澡盆里。这样，慢慢地就会引起他对水的兴趣而乐于洗澡。对于四至五周岁，生活比较懒散而又不太讲求卫生的女孩子来说，布娃娃是对她再好也没有的教育工具了。通过替娃娃穿衣袜，梳头发，几天给娃娃洗澡、洗衣服等，渐渐地她自己也就养成了爱整洁，爱劳动的习惯。
