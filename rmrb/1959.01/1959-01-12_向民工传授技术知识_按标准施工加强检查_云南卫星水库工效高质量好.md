According to Yunnan Daily, while continuously improving water conservancy efficiency, the Yunnan Province Jinning County Satellite Reservoir construction site pays special attention to educating migrant workers to value project quality and learn technology. From leading cadres to the vast number of migrant workers, the entire construction site is working hard and delving into technology to ensure that the reservoir project achieves both high efficiency and good quality.

The Satellite Reservoir is a medium-sized water conservancy project. In the process of striving for high efficiency, some migrant workers believed that "to be fast, it cannot be good; to be good, it cannot be fast" in water conservancy construction. Therefore, in the early stages of construction, there was a phenomenon of only focusing on quantity and not quality. At that time, the construction site leadership only generally deployed the issue of valuing quality, and the specific work was only controlled and inspected by one or two technicians, making it difficult to implement. With the specific help of the Jinning County Party Committee, the construction site leadership placed the issue of ensuring project quality in an important position. First, by summarizing the lessons learned from the poor quality of a few past water conservancy projects, the migrant workers were made to specifically recognize the importance of project quality; second, cadres and migrant workers on the construction site were educated to study and delve into technical knowledge in water conservancy, to work practically and skillfully, so as to ensure that both efficiency and project quality were improved.

The construction site leadership paid special attention to organizing the masses to learn and master relevant water conservancy engineering technical knowledge. The construction site director took the lead in seriously learning the basic knowledge of water conservancy operating procedures. Before each new task arrived, technical meetings were held in a timely manner with the participation of technicians, construction site leaders at all levels, and activists among the migrant workers, to study the technical operating procedures in this area, and specific specifications and quality requirements were put forward on the spot, and everyone was taught how to operate. Then, according to the different requirements and situations of the project, various forms were used to impart technology to the relevant migrant workers. Since the start of construction, according to the operating situation, the principles of building dam slopes in proportion, the importance of not mixing grass and stones in the soil used for the dam, and a series of technical knowledge such as foundation clearing and excavation of bonding trenches have been explained to the migrant workers. In order to enable migrant workers to construct in accordance with the prescribed design requirements in actual action, the leading cadres and technicians of the construction site continued to go deep into the construction site to directly impart technology. For example, various soil samples were placed in the soil extraction area to tell the soil extraction migrant workers about the characteristics of various soils, so that the soil extraction migrant workers could learn to identify the soil and be able to select suitable areas for soil extraction.

After the cadres and migrant workers attached importance to quality and mastered general engineering technical knowledge, the quality of the project was guaranteed. When digging the culvert foundation, some migrant workers were unwilling to dig to the bottom in order to save labor. The construction site director promptly carried out political and ideological education for the migrant workers, explaining the importance of adhering to quality to the migrant workers who were digging the culvert; explaining that if the culvert foundation was not dug to the hard bottom, there would be deformation, cracking, and leakage in the future. Therefore, the general migrant workers were able to consciously carry out the work according to the prescribed standards, and actively put forward rationalization proposals to ensure quality based on technical principles and local practical operating conditions. In the process of setting the culvert, after the technician told the stonemasons that the cement must be poured within twenty minutes to ensure quality, the stonemasons used the method of implementing assembly line operations to strive to shorten the time for pouring cement.

The construction site leadership also strengthened the inspection and acceptance system, and listed the quality of the project as one of the important conditions for evaluation. During the inspection, if it was found that the specifications and standards had not been met, the work was reworked.

Due to the full exertion of the enthusiasm and determination of all the migrant workers, the entire construction site achieved an average efficiency of 6.1 cubic meters of compacted earth per person per day (including all personnel in construction site management, odds and ends, etc.), and the project quality was simultaneously done carefully and conscientiously. In the case of a large amount of soil and rock layers, the foundation of the dam was cleared to extremely hard rock before backfilling; clay with low permeability was selected as the soil material for backfilling; when building the main dam, weeds, roots, and gravel were not allowed on the dam; in order to facilitate compaction, the thickness of each layer of soil was only one to two inches, and each layer was rolled three to four times.

    向民工传授技术知识  按标准施工加强检查
    云南卫星水库工效高质量好
    据云南日报消息　云南省晋宁县卫星水库工地在水利工效不断提高的同时，特别注意教育民工重视工程质量，学习技术。整个工地从领导干部到广大民工，都鼓足干劲，苦钻技术，保证了水库工程工效高、质量好。
    卫星水库是一个中型水利工程，在争取高工效过程中，有不少民工认为兴修水利“要快就不能好，要好就不能快”。因此，在动工初期，一度出现了只顾数量不顾质量的现象。当时工地领导机构只把重视质量的问题一般地布置下去，具体工作仅由一、两个技术人员掌握检查，结果很难贯彻。在晋宁县委的具体帮助下，工地领导机构才把保证工程质量问题放在重要地位来处理。首先通过总结过去少数水利工程质量不好的教训，使民工们具体地认识到工程质量的重要性；其次教育工地干部和民工学习钻研水利方面的技术知识，实干巧干，以保证工效、工程质量双双提高。
    工地领导机构特别注意组织群众学习掌握有关的水利工程技术知识。工地主任带头认真学习水利操作工序上的基本知识。在每一项新的工作任务到来以前，都及时召开了有技术员、工地各级领导干部、民工中的积极分子参加的技术会议，学习这方面的技术操作规程，并且当场提出具体的规格质量要求，当场教大家学会操作方法。然后根据工程的不同要求和情况，运用各种形式向有关的民工传授技术。从动工以来，根据操作情况，曾先后向民工讲解了坝坡按比例修筑的原理、上坝土壤不能掺杂有草石的重要性和清基、挖结合槽等一系列的技术知识。为了让民工在实际行动中都能按照规定的设计要求施工，工地领导干部和技术人员又不断深入施工现场直接传授技术，例如在取土区摆上了各种不同的土壤样品，向取土民工讲述各种土壤的特性，使取土民工学会鉴别土壤，能够选择适宜的地区取土。
    在干部和民工们重视质量并掌握了一般的工程技术知识后，工程质量得到了保证。在挖涵洞基础时，有的民工图省工不愿意挖到底，工地主任即及时对民工进行政治思想教育，一面向挖涵洞的民工讲清坚持质量的重要性；一面说明涵洞基础不挖到硬底子，将来会出现走样、开裂、漏水的现象，于是一般民工都能自觉地按照规定的标准去进行，并且根据技术原理和当地的实际操作条件，积极提出保证质量的合理化建议。在镶砌涵洞的过程中，技术员向石工讲述了水泥必须在二十分钟内灌下才能保证质量的道理后，石工师傅就用实行流水作业法来争取缩短灌水泥的时间。
    工地领导还加强了检查验收制度，并把质量的好坏列为评比的重要条件之一，检查中，发现没有达到规格标准的，就进行返工重做。
    由于充分发挥了全体民工的干劲、钻劲，整个工地在工效平均每天每人达到六点一个压实方的情况下
  （包括工地管理、勤杂等全部人员在内），工程质量同时做得细致认真。在土层岩石较多的情况下坚持把坝的基础清到极坚硬的岩层上才进行回填；回填中选用了透水性小的粘土作土料；修筑正坝时，做到了杂草、树根、碎石不上坝；为了便于压实，每层土的厚度只达到一公寸到两公寸，每层碾压三至四道。
