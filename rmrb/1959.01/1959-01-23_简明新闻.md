　　Building Terraced Fields
　　In the past month, the masses in Zhidan County launched an assault on steep slopes and rocky areas, building 130,000 mu of terraced fields. The speed of building terraced fields in this county is three times faster than before. This is mainly due to mobilizing the masses to carry out tool reforms on a large scale (a total of more than 4,800 advanced tools have been promoted), and the agricultural tool repair and assembly plants of each commune have also been moved to the construction site to ensure repairs are done as soon as tools break.
