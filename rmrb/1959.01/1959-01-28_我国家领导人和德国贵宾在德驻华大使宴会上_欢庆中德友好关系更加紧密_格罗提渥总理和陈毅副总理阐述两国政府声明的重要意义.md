Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Guozhang, hosted a grand banquet tonight for the visit of Premier Grotewohl-led government delegation to China.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other national leaders of our country attended tonight's banquet to celebrate with the distinguished guests the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Germany, and to bid farewell to the friendship envoys of the great German people who are about to leave our country.

Premier Grotewohl and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet successively. In their speeches, they reiterated the close cooperation and mutual support between the peoples of the two countries in their common struggle, and emphasized the importance of the joint statement signed today between the two governments of China and Germany. Premier Grotewohl said that the "two sides have reached complete consensus on all the issues discussed," which is "another manifestation of the unity of the socialist family fighting for common goals." Vice Premier Chen Yi also pointed out in his speech that the joint statement between the two governments and the Sino-German consular treaty signed at the same time are "significant events in the political life of our two peoples, and also a clear symbol of the further development of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples."

Premier Grotewohl spoke first at the beginning of the banquet, saying: "We once again feel with joy, gratitude, and pride that the Chinese people have sincere and friendly feelings towards the German people and are always ready to support the German people in their socialist construction and in their struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of the motherland with the spirit of proletarian internationalism."

He said: "I would also like to assure you that the working people of the German Democratic Republic and the progressive forces of the entire German people will give them more effective support in the Chinese people's struggle for a happy future."

He emphasized: China and Germany "welcome the Soviet Union's proposal of January 10, 1959, on concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and regard it as an effective step to ease the tension in Europe and revive the German nation." "Both sides expressed their determination to further develop friendly relations in an all-round way in the future. To this end, our two countries have signed a treaty on consular relations and reached an agreement to establish a consulate general in Shanghai. In addition, it is stipulated to increase the volume of foreign trade in 1959 and to sign a treaty of commerce and navigation and a long-term trade agreement."

Premier Grotewohl pointed out that the fraternal and close cooperation between the countries and peoples of the socialist camp is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism. He emphasized: China and Germany "reaffirm that they will continue to work tirelessly to enhance and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp in the future."

Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke. He said: "This visit to Asia and Africa by the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic has achieved great success. This visit has greatly consolidated and enhanced the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic strengthened the understanding and friendly co-operation of the German Democratic Republic with the United Arab Republic, Iraq, and India, and further developed the fraternal unity of the German Democratic Republic with Vietnam and China."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the profound friendship between the Chinese and German people has unlimited vitality and is unbreakable.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "At any time, the Chinese people will continue to fully support the socialist construction of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the just struggle for the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy and for the maintenance of world peace."

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally wished the people of the German Democratic Republic greater achievements in the struggle to build their own country and to realize the unification of the German nation into a peaceful and democratic country and sincerely asked Premier Grotewohl to bring the friendship of the 650 million Chinese people to the German people.

More than 600 Chinese and foreign guests welcomed Premier Grotewohl and Vice Premier Chen Yi's speeches at the banquet with bursts of warm applause. After their speeches, the band played the national anthems of China and Germany respectively.

Although the visit of the distinguished guests was only a few days, it left a deep and unforgettable impression on our people. Today, when the distinguished guests and our national leaders and people from all walks of life gather together again, everyone repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the friendship between the Chinese and German people, and to congratulate the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
