    Nikolai Podgorny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, said in his report to the Congress that the Ukrainian Republic could complete the agricultural tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in four to five years.

The reporter said that compared with 1953, Ukraine's grain production increased by 44%, sugar beets doubled, milk increased by three-quarters, and meat increased by 45%. At present, no country in the world can compare with Ukraine in terms of using sugar beets to produce sugar. When talking about industrial production, Podgorny pointed out that Ukraine's pig iron production per capita has exceeded all capitalist countries in the world, including the United States. By the time the Seven-Year Plan is completed in 1965, Ukraine's metallurgical industry will increase by 40% to 57% compared to 1958, the chemical industry will increase by 2.3 times, the light industry will increase by about 70%, and the production of wool, silk, and cotton fabrics will increase by 1.6 times.
