Zhou Enlai Said at the Reception Given by the Soviet Ambassador to Celebrate the First Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Scientific Cooperation Agreement:
    The Soviet Cosmic Rocket is a Boon for Peace
    If Warmongers are Keen on Military Rocket Races or Even Risk Starting Wars, They Will Fail Even More Miserably
    Ambassador Yudin Warmly Congratulates the Close Cooperation Between Chinese and Soviet Scientists

Xinhua News Agency, January 15th. At the reception given tonight by Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement between the Soviet Union and China on Jointly Conducting and the Soviet Union Helping China Conduct Major Scientific and Technological Research," two hundred Chinese and foreign guests warmly congratulated the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket, congratulated the outstanding achievements of Soviet science and technology, and its great contribution to world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception and delivered a speech.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai first extended New Year greetings to all Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception. Premier Zhou then said that we have something even happier than celebrating the New Year, and that is that the Soviet Union successfully launched a cosmic rocket on the second day of the New Year, creating the first artificial solar planet. We Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world feel infinitely happy and encouraged by such a great event that has shaken the world, and express our warm congratulations.

Premier Zhou said that such a great event is a brilliant achievement of Soviet scientists, the beginning of mankind entering outer space, and a gospel for safeguarding world peace. Now that mankind has the possibility of entering outer space to carry out activities, some warmongers are still trying to create wars of aggression on Earth, causing mankind to suffer killings. More and more people will realize how foolish this is, and will resolutely join the ranks of defending peace, making the warmongers increasingly isolated. We thank the Soviet cosmic rocket for giving us greater confidence and strength in defending peace.

Premier Zhou went on to point out that, of course, things will develop in two directions. The imperialist warmongers will not hold the same view as us. Seeing the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket, they will be more keen on conducting military rocket races, rather than using rocket technology for peaceful purposes. However, since the Soviet Union already has rockets that can reach the second cosmic velocity, and such heavy and accurate rockets, if the imperialist warmongers insist on conducting military rocket races, or even risk starting wars, they will fail even more miserably, and universal and lasting world peace will come even faster. Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the great epoch-making achievements made by Soviet scientists under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and through the joint efforts of the Soviet people, and to the great victory of mankind in conquering outer space!

Ambassador Yudin spoke first at the beginning of the reception. In his speech, he said that the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket is an event of great historical significance in human knowledge of the laws of the development of the universe and nature, and a new step forward in the historical development of human progress. It is a great victory for progressive mankind all over the world and also the greatest national pride of the Soviet people. Ambassador Yudin said that the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket immediately received the widest response from all over the world, and our great friends and allies—the Chinese people—very happily welcomed this event. After quoting the evaluations of the Chinese and world public opinion on this great achievement of the Soviet Union, Ambassador Yudin pointed out that peace-loving countries and people all over the world and a very small number of warmongers have expressed two completely different attitudes towards the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket.

Peace-loving countries and people rightly regard the Soviet rocket as a further consolidation of the cause of peace for all nations, while the representatives of war extremists, first of all, the bellicose groups of American imperialism, regard this news as their military failure and demand that the US government increase more military appropriations.

Ambassador Yudin finally said that we hope that scientists from other countries will repeat or surpass the achievements of Soviet scientists in the near future, and we will be happy and encouraged about this in the future.

Han Guang, Deputy Director of the Science and Technology Commission of the People's Republic of China, said in his speech at the reception that the successful launch of the cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union is a new milestone on the road for mankind to conquer outer space. It marks that the Soviet Union has left the most developed capitalist countries far behind in the latest science and technology. It further proves that the East wind is overwhelming the West wind with greater advantages. This great achievement of the Soviet Union has greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp and greatly enhanced the confidence of progressive people all over the world. It is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are accelerating socialist construction.

In their speeches at the reception, Ambassador Yudin and Deputy Director Han Guang also warmly congratulated the close cooperation between the scientists of the two countries and pointed out the great significance of this cooperation.

Ambassador Yudin said that there are the closest relations and cooperation in political, economic and cultural aspects between our two friendly socialist countries. The characteristic of the scientific cooperation agreement signed in January 1958 is that the scientists of the two countries jointly study one hundred and twenty-two topics of great scientific and economic significance. The results of studying these topics will be a contribution to the common cause of developing socialist culture and science. I wish scientists and experts of the two countries major creative achievements so that our two countries can add new scientific inventions and technological transformations to promote social progress and development.

In his speech, Deputy Director Han Guang also emphasized that Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation has promoted the economic construction and the development of science and technology of the two countries, especially for our country, it has a significant effect. In recent years, through scientific and technological cooperation, the Soviet Union has given our country great scientific and technological assistance, and helped us cultivate scientific and technological forces in many ways. For this, we express our deep gratitude! We must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union, and closely cooperate with scientific and technological workers of the two countries in order to further promote the common development of economic construction and scientific and technological undertakings of our two countries.

Also present at tonight's reception were Vice-Chairmen Huang Yanpei and Chen Shutong, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhu Kezhen and Wu Youxun, Deputy Directors of the Science and Technology Commission Liu Xiyao, Zhang Youxuan, Fan Changjiang, Wu Heng, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Li Dequan, Ma Yinchu, Shao Lizi, Secretary-General Qian Junrui, as well as heads of various departments of our government, famous scientists from China and the Soviet Union, and diplomatic envoys to China.

The head of the diplomatic mission, Indonesian Ambassador to China Wiyopranto, also delivered a speech at the reception, saying, "We congratulate the Soviet government, Soviet leaders, Soviet scientists and workers for the scientific achievements they have achieved. Our generation is very happy to see this achievement, because such achievements can benefit mankind." He raised his glass and proposed a toast to the Soviet leaders, the Soviet people, and world peace!

After the reception, the Soviet film "Road to the Stars" was shown.

    周总理在苏联大使庆祝中苏科学合作协定一周年招待会上说
    苏联宇宙火箭是保障和平的福音
    战争狂人如果热中于军事火箭竞赛甚至冒险发动战争，就一定会失败得更惨
    尤金大使在讲话中热烈祝贺中苏科学家的亲密合作
    新华社15日讯　在苏联驻中国大使尤金今晚为庆祝“苏中关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究协定”签订一周年而举行的招待会上，二百位中外来宾热烈祝贺苏联发射宇宙火箭成功，祝贺苏联科学技术的卓越成就和对世界和平的伟大贡献。
    周恩来总理出席了招待会并讲了话。
    周恩来总理在讲话中首先向所有参加招待会的中外来宾祝贺新年。周总理接着说，我们还有比欢度新年更高兴的事情，这就是苏联在新年的第二天成功地发射了宇宙火箭，创造了第一个人造太阳行星。对这样一件震动全世界的伟大事件，我们中国人民，全世界爱好和平的人民，都感到无限的欢欣鼓舞，并且表示热烈的庆贺。
    周总理说，这样一件大喜事是苏联科学家的辉煌成就，是人类进入宇宙空间的开始，也是保障世界和平的福音。现在，人类已经有了进入宇宙空间进行活动的可能，而有些战争狂人却还企图在地球上制造侵略战争，让人类遭受残杀。越来越多的人会认识到这是多么愚蠢，因而会坚决地投入保卫和平的队伍，使战争狂人们越来越孤立。我们感谢苏联宇宙火箭给了我们更大的保卫和平的信心和力量。
    周总理接着指出，当然，事情是会向两方面发展的。帝国主义战争狂人们是不会同我们持一样看法的，他们看到苏联发射宇宙火箭成功，将会更加热中于进行军事火箭的竞赛，而不是把火箭技术用于和平的目的。但是，既然苏联已经有了达到第二宇宙速度的火箭，有了这样重、这样准确的火箭，帝国主义战争狂人们如果要一意孤行地进行军事火箭竞赛，甚至冒险发动战争，他们就一定会失败得更惨，而世界普遍的永久的和平，就会来得更快。最后，周恩来总理提议为苏联科学家在苏联共产党的领导下、在苏联人民的共同努力下所取得的伟大的划时代的成就而干杯，为人类在征服宇宙空间方面所取得的巨大胜利而干杯！
    尤金大使在招待会开始时首先讲话。他在讲话中说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射成功，是在人类关于宇宙和自然界发展规律的知识方面有着重大历史意义的事件，是人类进步的历史发展上的一次新的迈进。它是全世界进步人类的伟大胜利，也是苏联人民最大的民族自豪。尤金大使说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射立刻受到了全世界最广泛的反应，我们伟大的朋友和同盟者——中国人民非常高兴地欢迎这个事件。尤金大使接着引述了中国和世界各国舆论对苏联这一伟大成就的评价以后指出，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民与极少数的战争狂人们对于苏联宇宙火箭的发射成功，表示了两种完全不同的态度。
    爱好和平的国家和人民正当地把苏联火箭看做是对各国人民和平事业的进一步巩固，而战争极端的代表，首先是美帝国主义好战集团，把这个消息看做是自己的军事失败，并且要求美国政府增加更多的军事拨款。
    尤金大使最后说，我们希望其他各国科学家在不久的将来重复或者超过苏联科学家的成就，对这件事我们将来是要欢欣鼓舞的。
    中华人民共和国科学技术委员会副主任韩光在招待会上的讲话中说，苏联成功地发射了宇宙火箭是人类征服宇宙空间道路上的新的里程碑，它标志着苏联在最新的科学技术方面把最发达的资本主义国家远远地抛在后面，它进一步证明了东风正以更大的优势在压倒西风，苏联这个伟大成就，大大地加强了社会主义阵营的力量，大大地增强了全世界进步人类斗争的信心，对正在为加速社会主义建设的中国人民是个极大的鼓舞。
    尤金大使和韩光副主任在招待会的讲话中，还热烈祝贺两国科学家的亲密合作，指出了这个合作的重大意义。
    尤金大使说，我们两个友好的社会主义国家之间有着政治、经济和文化方面最密切的关系与合作。1958年1月所签订的科学合作协定的特点就是两国科学家共同研究一百二十二项有很大的科学和经济意义的题目，研究这些题目的结果对于发展社会主义文化科学的共同事业将是一种贡献。我预祝两国科学家和专家取得重大的创造性的成就，使得我们两国增添科学新发明和技术改造，推动社会进步和发展。
    韩光副主任在讲话中也强调说，中苏科学技术合作促进了两国的经济建设和科学技术的发展，特别是对我国有重大的作用。几年来，通过科学技术合作，苏联给予我国以巨大的科学技术援助，并多方面帮助我们培养科学技术力量。对此，我们特表示深切的感谢！我们更要努力向苏联学习，密切中苏两国的科学技术工作者间的合作，以进一步促进我们两国经济建设和科学技术事业的共同发展。
    出席今晚招待会的，还有黄炎培、陈叔通副委员长，外交部副部长张闻天，中国科学院副院长竺可桢、吴有训，科学技术委员会副主任刘西尧、张友萱、范长江、武衡，中苏友好协会总会副会长李德全、马寅初、邵力子、秘书长钱俊瑞，以及我国政府各部门的负责人、中苏两国著名科学家和各国驻华使节。
    外交使团团长、印度尼西亚驻华大使维约普拉诺托也在招待会上致词说，我们祝贺苏联政府、苏联领袖、苏联科学家和工人所获得的科学成就，我们这一代人很高兴看到这个成就，因为这样的成就能够为人类谋福利。他举杯提议为苏联领导人、苏联人民和世界和平而干杯！
    招待会结束后，放映了苏联电影“到星球之路”。
