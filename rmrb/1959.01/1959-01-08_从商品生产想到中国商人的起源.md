    From Commodity Production to the Origins of Chinese Merchants
    Liu Mianzhi

    Recently, people have become very interested in the question of commodity production while studying political economy. From commodity production, one will think of the character "shang" (商), and the term "shang ren" (商人), or merchant. How did the term "shang ren" come about? According to historical documents, merchants in China have a very long history.

    The "Records of the Grand Historian, Zheng Family" states that Zheng Huan Gong You served as Situ under King You of Zhou, and gathered the people of Zhou, who liked him very much. The people between the Yellow River and the Luo River all missed him. Later, Zheng Huan Gong led a part of the Zhou people to move east to the east of the Luo River, establishing the state of Zheng in Xinzheng. This part of the Zhou people settled down.

    A part of the Zhou people who were good at trading were actually remnants of the Yin people.

    These Yin remnants, i.e., merchants, were concentrated in Chengzhou, now Luoyang, through the following process.

    After King Wu defeated Zhou, although the Zhou Dynasty gained ruling power, the strength of the Yin people in the east was not destroyed. The method of control was to divide and rule, and to send troops to suppress them. The central Henan area of Yin was divided into three states: Bei was enfeoffed to Wu Geng, the son of Zhou; Yong was governed by Guan Shu, the younger brother of King Wu; and Wei was governed by Cai Shu, the younger brother of King Wu. These were called the Three Overseers. Guan Shu and Cai Shu were commanders of military forces, suppressing the Yin people and monitoring Wu Geng. When King Wu died and King Cheng was young, the Duke of Zhou took power. Guan Shu and Cai Shu allied with Wu Geng to rebel. The Duke of Zhou campaigned eastward to quell the rebellion, and established Luoyang as a military center to suppress the east, called Chengzhou. The Yin people were moved to Luoyang. The "Book of Documents, Many Officers" states: "Chengzhou being completed, the stubborn people of Yin were moved." "The Book of Documents, Bi Ming" states: "Take care of the stubborn people of Yin and move them to Luoyi." Some Yin remnants were dispersed to various places, such as enfeoffing Bo Qin, the son of the Duke of Zhou, with the people of Shang and Yan to establish the state of Lu, and granting him six clans of Yin people. Kang Shu, the younger brother of King Wu, was enfeoffed at the original ruins of Yin, and granted seven clans of Yin people (Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ding, Year Four). Some were incorporated into the army, such as the inscription on the Bai Mao Fu Dun vessel: "The King ordered Bo Mao Fu to use the eight *lue* of Yin to attack the Eastern Yi."

    The Yin remnants were forcibly concentrated in Luoyang. The Zhou people called them stubborn people. They were often summoned for speeches and not allowed to speak or move freely, living under surveillance. The Yin remnants were part of the Zhou people, but were viewed differently. They had no political rights and lost their land. How could they make a living? They had no choice but to run around doing business. The Zhou aristocrats disdained this profession, and the common people had to farm and could not do it, but it was needed by society. Over time, commerce became the main occupation of the Yin remnants.

    How did the Yin remnants come to be called merchants? This is because Yin was the name used after Pan Geng moved to Bo. For hundreds of years before Pan Geng, it was originally called Shang. Qi was enfeoffed in Shang, and Shang was a place name. The name merchant came from the place name Shang, which became the name of the dynasty. After Pan Geng, although the name was changed to Yin, the name Shang was still habitually retained. Yin and Shang were used interchangeably, and Yin people were merchants. Even in the "Book of Documents, Many Officers," the Zhou Dynasty still referred to the Yin capital as Tianyi Shang in its reprimand to the "stubborn Yin people."

    According to documents, oracle bone inscriptions, and the situation of the Yin ruins, the Shang Dynasty already had currency, using shells calculated in strings. There were many commodities from various places, and commerce was quite developed.

    Therefore, the term merchant originated from the people of the Shang Dynasty. From the Zhou people's perspective, merchants were "stubborn people" who were viewed differently, but also needed by society. Merchants (those who do business) came from the Shang people (Yin remnants). As they lived together for a long time, the merchants in the state of Zheng guaranteed that they would not rebel, the ethnic boundaries gradually disappeared, and some Zhou people also participated in commercial activities, and even some aristocrats came to do business. In this way, the merchant lost its original meaning of "stubborn people" and became the exclusive term for the profession of engaging in commercial activities, becoming one of the four classes of ancient feudal society: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.

### 从商品生产想到中国商人的起源

    从商品生产想到中国商人的起源
    刘勉之
    最近，人们在学习政治经济学的时候，对商品生产问题很发生兴趣。从商品生产，就会想到“商”字，就会想到“商人”这一名词。“商人”这一名词是怎么来的呢？从历史文献看，商人在中国，却是历史很悠久的了。
    史记郑世家说郑桓公友为周幽王司徒，和集周民，周民很喜欢他，河洛之间的人民，都想念他。后来郑桓公带领一部分周民东迁到洛水以东，立国于新郑，这一部分周民就定居下来了。
    周民中一部分会作买卖的商人，即殷遗民。
    殷遗民即商人，被集中在成周即今洛阳的经过是这样的。
    武王伐纣，取得胜利以后，周虽然取得了统治权，但东方殷人的实力并未被摧毁。控制的办法是分而治之，派兵镇压。把殷的中心河内地区分为三国，邶封给纣子武庚，鄘以武王弟管叔为尹，卫以武王弟蔡叔为尹。叫作三监。管蔡二叔是统帅军事力量，镇压殷民，监视武庚的。到武王死，成王幼小，周公执政，管蔡二叔和武庚联兵反叛，周公东征平定，建立洛阳为镇压东方的军事中心，叫作成周。把殷民迁到洛阳。尚书多士：“成周既成，迁殷顽民。”毕命：“毖殷顽民，迁于洛邑。”又把部分殷遗民分散到各地去，如以原来商、奄之民封周公子伯禽，建鲁国，又赐以殷民六族，于原来殷墟封武王少弟康叔，又赐以殷民七族，（左传定公四年）或编入军队，如白懋父敦盖：“王命伯懋父以殷八?征东夷。”等等。
    殷遗民被强迫集中在洛阳，周人叫他们作顽民，经常被召集训话，不许乱说乱动，过着被监视的生活。殷遗民是周民的一部分，但却被另眼相看。他们既无政治权利，又失去了土地，怎么过日子呢，只好东跑西跑作买卖。这一行业周的贵族不屑做，庶民要种地不能做，而又为社会所需要，日子久了，商业成为殷遗民的主要行业了。
    殷遗民怎么会叫作商人呢？这是因为殷是盘庚迁亳以后的称呼，在盘庚以前几百年原来是叫商的。契封于商，商是地名，商人之名是从商这个地名转为朝代名而来的。盘庚以后，虽然改称殷了，但习惯上还保存着商的称呼，殷、商兼称，殷人即商人。直到尚书多士，周王朝对“殷顽民”的训词中还称殷的首都为天邑商呢。
    据文献、甲骨文和殷墟遗物的情况看来，商朝已经有了货币，用贝以朋计算，有来自各地的许多商品，商业是相当发达的。
    所以商人这一名词出于商朝的人，从周人说来，商人是“顽民”，是被另眼相看的人，但也是被社会所需要的人。商人（作生意的人）出于商人（殷遗民），到了共处日子久了，郑国内商人保证不造反了，民族的界限逐渐泯灭了，周人中也有人参加商业活动，甚至某些贵族也来作买卖了，这样，商人就失去了原来“顽民”的意义，成为从事商业活动的职业的专称，成为古代封建社会士、农、工、商四民之一了。
