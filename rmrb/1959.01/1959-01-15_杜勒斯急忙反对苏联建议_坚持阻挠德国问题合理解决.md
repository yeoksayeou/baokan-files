Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held a press conference on the 13th. At this press conference, he mainly discussed the issue of Mikoyan's visit to the United States and reiterated the U.S. attitude of obstructing a solution to the German question.

In answering questions from reporters, Dulles said that in the upcoming talks between Mikoyan and U.S. government leaders, the U.S. side hopes to conclude the exchange of views that Mikoyan had already begun earlier in Washington. He said that the main purpose of these talks, as seen by the U.S., is to understand the Soviet Union's ideas and, where possible, "enable them to understand our ideas." Dulles said that the U.S. "does not regard these talks as negotiations. We are not conducting bilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union on issues that are equally relevant to other countries and, to some extent, even more relevant to other countries than to ourselves."

A reporter asked Dulles whether his remarks meant that the U.S. leaders' purpose in the upcoming talks with Mikoyan was only to clarify whether there had been any changes in the Soviet position, especially on the German question; and whether the U.S. side intended to propose specific "counter-proposals." Dulles replied that in the talks, the U.S. "can only state our overall attitude, which is our overall view of the situation, rather than putting forward specific proposals that must first be agreed upon with our allies." He emphasized that the U.S. still adheres to the proposal and statement made in its reply to the Soviet Union on December 31, with the agreement of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, regarding the unreasonable rejection of turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

When talking about the Soviet Union's recent proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany, Dulles said that he firmly opposed these proposals. Dulles described the Soviet proposals on signing a peace treaty with Germany and turning West Berlin into a free city so that Germany could embark on the path of peace, democracy, and unity as "unworkable" and not a "sound solution." He insisted that the proposal to make Germany a peaceful, democratic country that does not participate in military blocs would "isolate Germany" and "make Germany a difficult and dangerous force to deal with."

Dulles reiterated that the U.S. still insists on unifying Germany through so-called "free elections," that is, it still dreams of West Germany annexing Democratic Germany, a bankrupt proposition. He insisted that discussing issues related to Berlin and a peace treaty with Germany while deviating from the issue of unifying Germany on the basis of "free elections" is "unrealistic." However, when a reporter asked him whether he believed that "free elections" were the only way to unify Germany, Dulles said, "We have never said that." He said, "This seems to us to be a natural way. But I am not willing to say that this is the only way to achieve reunification." But he refused to explain what other methods he thought could unify Germany.

    杜勒斯急忙反对苏联建议
    坚持阻挠德国问题合理解决
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在13日举行记者招待会。他在这个记者招待会上主要是谈有关米高扬访问美国的问题，并且重申美国阻挠解决德国问题的态度。
    杜勒斯在回答记者提出的问题时说，在即将举行的米高扬和美国政府领导人的会谈中，美国方面希望结束早些时候米高扬在华盛顿时已经开始的意见交换。他说，美国认为进行这些会谈的主要目的是要了解苏联的想法，并且在可能的情况下，“使他们能够了解我们的想法”。杜勒斯说，美国“并不把这些会谈看作是谈判。我们并不就跟其他国家同样有关以及在某种程度上甚至对其他国家比对我们自己的关系更大的问题，同苏联进行双边谈判”。
    有记者问杜勒斯，他这番话是否意味着美国领导人在即将同米高扬举行的会谈中所抱的目的只是为了澄清在苏联的立场方面是否有所改变，特别是在德国问题方面；而美国方面是否打算提出具体的“反建议”。杜勒斯回答说，在会谈中美国“只能表明我们总的态度，就是我们对于局势的总的看法，而不是提出必须首先跟我们的盟国谈妥的具体建议”。他强调，美国目前还是坚持它在北大西洋公约组织成员同意下在12月31日给苏联复照中作出的关于无理拒绝使西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议和声明。
    杜勒斯在谈到苏联最近提出的关于缔结对德和约的建议时说，他坚决反对这些建议。杜勒斯把苏联提出的关于签订对德和约和把西柏林变为自由城市以便德国走上和平、民主与统一的道路的建议说成是“行不通的”，不是一个“健全的解决办法”，他硬说，使德国成为一个和平、民主和不参加军事集团的国家的建议是“孤立德国”，“将使德国成为一种难对付的、危险的力量”。
    杜勒斯重申，美国目前还是坚持通过所谓“自由选举”来统一德国、也就是说仍然梦想由西德吞并民主德国的破了产的主张。他硬说，脱离在“自由选举的基础上统一德国的问题”而去讨论同柏林和对德和约有关的问题是“不现实的”。但是当记者问他是否认为“自由选举”是德国统一的唯一途径时，杜勒斯又说，“我们从没有这样说过”。他说，“这在我们看来是一种自然的办法。但是我不愿说，这是能够实现重新统一的唯一办法”。但是他拒绝说明他认为还有什么方法可以统一德国。
