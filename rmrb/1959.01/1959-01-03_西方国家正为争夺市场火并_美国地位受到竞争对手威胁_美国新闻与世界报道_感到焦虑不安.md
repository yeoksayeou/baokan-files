Xinhua News Agency, New York: “The days when American companies could easily penetrate export markets are gone forever. American businessmen are beginning to have to pay renewed attention to the growing competitive strength of Western Europe and Japan.” This is the conclusion reached by "U.S. News & World Report" in its December 26th issue regarding the increasingly fierce struggle for markets in the capitalist world.

    In reports from New York, London, Frankfurt, Milan, and Tokyo, the magazine said, “The competitive position of the United States is changing. Foreign competitors, especially those in Europe, are catching up quickly. The long-standing leadership of American business and the ease of sales are being replaced by a period of internecine strife.” The magazine also said that the United States must now not only fight for foreign markets, but also faces "the danger of foreign goods invading" the domestic market.

    The report cited a large number of facts to illustrate that America's overseas competitors are "showing a clear upward trend" while the United States is "losing ground." In the first ten months of 1958, U.S. exports decreased by 17% compared to the same period in 1957. The report believes that "from a competitive point of view," the export situation of manufactured goods is more important, and the figures for U.S. manufactured goods exports in the first ten months of this year are the lowest since 1954.

    The magazine said that well-known American entrepreneurs and bankers believe that the price of American goods is causing them to lose sales in the market. Many European capitalists have openly declared that "the competitive strength of the United States is no longer so strong." The reason for the high price of American goods is not only that American companies' equipment is not more modern than European companies, but also that the United States has to add a large amount of freight, so in many places people would rather buy products from other countries than buy American goods. In terms of loans, many countries would rather obtain credit in marks, pounds, and yen than in dollars. The magazine said, "All this means that there is no advantage in buying American goods overseas, and American manufacturers are clearly facing a new era."

    The magazine spoke with the same anxiety about the increasingly fierce competition faced by the United States in the domestic market. In September 1958, U.S. imports increased by 10% compared to the same period in 1957. In recent years, a large increase in imports has been in manufactured goods, which are also manufactured in the United States. This year, manufactured goods imported into the United States accounted for 30% of total imports, while in 1950 they only accounted for 17%.

### 西方国家正为争夺市场火并  美国地位受到竞争对手威胁  “美国新闻与世界报道”感到焦虑不安

    西方国家正为争夺市场火并
    美国地位受到竞争对手威胁
    “美国新闻与世界报道”感到焦虑不安
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：“美国公司随时可以渗入出口市场的日子已经一去不复返了。美国商人已经开始不得不重新重视西欧和日本的愈来愈增长的竞争力量。”这是12月26日出版的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”对资本主义世界愈来愈剧烈的争夺市场的斗争作出的结论。
    这家刊物在从纽约、伦敦、法兰克福、米兰、东京发出的报道中说，“美国的竞争地位正在发生变化。外国的竞争者，特别是在欧洲的竞争者，都很快地赶上来了。美国商业长期领先的地位和销售方面容易脱手的状况正在为互相火并的时期所代替。”这家刊物同时说，现在美国不仅必须为国外市场进行斗争，而且国内市场也受到“外国货物入侵的危险”。
    这篇报道列举了大量的事实说明美国的海外竞争者“显出明显的上升趋势”而美国却“正在丧失地盘”。1958年头十个月，美国出口额比1957年同期减少了17％。报道认为，“从竞争的观点来看”，更重要的事情是制成品的出口情况如何，而今年头十个月美国制成品出口的数字是1954年以来最低的。
    这家刊物说，美国著名的企业家和银行家认为，美国货的价格正在使自己在市场上丧失销路，欧洲的许多资本家已经公开宣称，“美国的竞争力量不再那么强大了”。美国货的价格高的原因，不仅是由于美国企业的设备并不比欧洲的企业更现代化，而且美国还要加上大量的运费，因此在很多地方人们宁愿买其他国家的产品而不愿买美国货。在贷款方面，很多国家宁愿获得马克、英镑和日元而不愿获得美元的信贷。这家刊物说，“这一切意味着在海外购买美国货没有什么好处，美国制造商显然面临着新的时代。”
    这家刊物以同样焦虑的心情谈到美国在国内市场上遭到的越来越激烈的竞争。1958年9月份美国的输入比1957年同期增长了10％。近年来，输入中大量增加的是制成品，而这些货物都是美国也在制造的。今年输入美国的制成品占输入总额的30％。而1950年则只占到17％。
