    On Learning

    After reading two short articles on page 8 of the People's Daily ("Make Learning a Regular Part of Our Lives" and "On the Learning Problems of Rural Cadres"), I would like to share some opinions.

    Based on the situation in our unit, the leadership's call for learning is still just a general one, without concrete measures. Cadres are busy with work and rushing to complete tasks, and do not consider learning to be necessary. They lack learning habits, and also lack the determination, confidence, and perseverance to learn. We subscribe to quite a few books, newspapers, and magazines, but not many people read them. This needs to be further addressed.

    In addition, I suggest that the theoretical publications of the provincial and municipal Party committees take some measures, such as publishing commentaries and opening special columns, to encourage people to make learning a regular practice, establish a system, and make it a necessary part of their lives.

    关于学习
    读了人民日报八版的两篇短文（“使学习成为我们的生活常规”和“谈农村干部的学习问题”），想谈一点意见。
    根据我们单位的情况，领导对学习还只是一般号召，没有切实的措施；干部工作忙，赶工作，不认为学习也是必需的；没有学习习惯，也还缺乏学习的决心、信心和恒心。书报杂志订得倒不少，但看的人却不多。这是需要进一步解决的。
    另外，我建议各省、市委的理论刊物，采取一些措施，如发表评论，开辟专栏等，促使人们把学习变成常规、形成制度、成为生活内容必要的一部分。
