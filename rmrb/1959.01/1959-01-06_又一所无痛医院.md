They widely solicit patients' opinions, collect relevant information, analyze the causes of medical pain, and take measures to achieve painless effects.

    又一所无痛医院
  据新华社呼和浩特5日电　内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局卫生院已经成为一座无痛医院。据去年12月份统计，这个卫生院的注射不痛率达到99.5％；换药不痛率达到80％；正常分娩不痛率达到75％，微痛占15％；外科手术基本上实现了不痛，穿刺、拔牙和检查等完全做到了不痛。
    这座卫生院是内蒙古一座规模较大的医院，是大兴安岭林区各族职工及其家属们的医疗中心。它拥有各种现代化医疗设备和一百七十张病床，有一百九十多名医务工作人员。经过整风运动和社会主义、共产主义教育，全院医务工作者政治觉悟和工作热情大为提高，树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。他们提出：“一切为了生产、为了病人”的口号，个个干劲冲天。他们广泛地征求患者意见，收集有关资料，分析医疗疼痛的原因，采取措施来达到无痛的效果。
