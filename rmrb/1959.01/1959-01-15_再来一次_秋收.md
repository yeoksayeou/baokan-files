A "Second Autumn Harvest"

    The peasants of Macheng County, Hubei Province, said to the comrades of the work team for rectifying the communes: "1958 should have a good ending, and 1959 should have a bigger leap forward." This opinion is not only from the peasants of Macheng, but from peasants all over the country.
    What does it mean to have a good ending in 1958? In terms of production, it means getting all the fruits of labor. Every grain of food and every boll of cotton is the result of the hard work of the vast number of peasants. It is entirely right for the peasants to cherish them especially. Many places have timely combined commune rectification and winter production, and the practice of conducting a "second autumn harvest" and a "third autumn harvest" for the scattered crops still left in the fields is very good. Longjuan Commune in Anxi County, Fujian Province, mobilized the masses to harvest carefully three times, and harvested more than 500,000 jin of sweet potato tubers and more than 3 million jin of sweet potato leaves and roots on more than 10,000 mu of sweet potato land. Recently, Hebei Province has launched a campaign to find fallen flowers, stiff petal flowers, and eyelashes (unpicked flowers) in conjunction with cotton purchase work. The two regions of Handan and Shijiazhuang alone recovered 30 million jin of seed cotton. It is said that the scattered and small-scale crops that have not yet been recovered in some areas are about 10% of last year's total output. From the perspective of individual units, it is indeed not a big deal to see that there are occasionally one or two mu of peanuts that have not been dug, or a few beans that have not been harvested. From a national perspective, the crops that have not yet been recovered, if there are 10%, or less, or more, are a huge wealth in total, and a huge material force for building socialism and improving people's lives.
    At present, all kinds of work and production in the vast rural areas are very busy, and there is a shortage of labor. It is indeed a contradiction to extract a certain amount of labor to do this. The solution to this contradiction requires a comprehensive arrangement of various tasks in rural areas and a unified plan for labor. The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party requires us to learn the working method of "walking on two legs," and to be good at starting from the overall situation and making overall arrangements when carrying out any work or handling any problem, so as to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another. Recovering all the fruits of the bumper harvest in 1958 and doing a good job in winter production to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959 also requires "walking on two legs" and combining various tasks well.

### 再来一次“秋收”

    再来一次“秋收”
    湖北省麻城县的农民对整社工作队的同志们说：“1958年应该有个很好的结尾，1959年再来个更大的跃进。”这个意见不仅是麻城农民的，全国农民都有这个要求。
    1958年，要有个很好的结尾是什么意思呢？表现在生产上，就是把全部的劳动果实拿到手。每一颗粮食，每一朵棉花都是广大农民辛勤劳动的成果。农民对它特别珍惜完全是应该的。很多地方及时地结合整社和冬季生产，对仍留在田里的零星作物进行了“第二次秋收”“第三次秋收”的作法是很好的。福建安溪县龙涓公社发动群众三次细收，在一万多亩甘薯地里，多收薯块五十多万斤，薯叶、薯根三百多万斤。河北省最近结合棉花收购工作，开展了找落地花、僵瓣花、眼睫毛（未摘净的花）的运动，仅邯郸和石家庄两个专区就复收了三千万斤籽棉。据说，有些地区现在仍未收回来的零星的、小宗庄稼约等于去年总产量的10％上下。从个别单位看来，只是这里偶尔还有一亩两亩花生未刨，那里见或有几棵豆子未割，的确算不了一件了不起的大事情。从全国看来，还未收回的庄稼，如果有10％，或者少些，或者多些，总起来就是一笔巨大的财富，是一个巨大的建设社会主义、改善人民生活的物质力量。
    目前，广大农村各种工作、生产都很忙，劳动力都感到不足，再要抽出一定的劳力去搞这件事，的确是个矛盾。解决这个矛盾的办法，需要把农村的各项工作通盘安排一下，把劳动力统一规划一下。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中，要求我们学会“用两条腿走路”的工作方法，要我们在进行任何工作、处理任何问题的时候，善于从全面出发，善于统筹安排，避免顾此失彼。收回1958年的全部丰收果实和搞好冬季生产，争取1959年更大跃进，也要“两条腿走路”，也要把各项工作很好结合起来。
