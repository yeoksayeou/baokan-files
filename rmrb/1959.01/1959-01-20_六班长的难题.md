Political Commissar Xia Zhendong of a certain unit became a soldier in the Third Company. The company decided to assign him to the Sixth Work Squad. As soon as he entered, he saw Squad Leader Lai Xigen and immediately gave him a salute. Squad Leader Lai was stunned, forgetting to return the salute. After a long while, he stuttered, "Chief, you've come." "No, I'm a soldier in your squad. Call me Xia Zhendong from now on."

In the past, Lai Xigen had been Xia Zhendong's bodyguard. Sometimes, when he encountered difficult problems, he would even cry in front of the chief. Today, to be this veteran Red Army soldier's "immediate superior" felt somewhat inconvenient. Xia Zhendong had already seen through the squad leader's thoughts and knew he couldn't make the squad leader uncomfortable. From the day he arrived in the squad, he took the lead in everything. Whenever he had time, he would read the newspaper, teach songs, and tell battle stories to the comrades. The squad was very active, work was eagerly taken up, and the squad leader no longer felt constrained by Xia Zhendong being a soldier in the squad. On the contrary, he felt that Xia Zhendong had brought great strength to the squad, and everything felt like having a support. Everyone also cared about this old "Private." Afraid of exhausting him, they always tried not to let him do too much heavy work. One day, the Sixth Squad was working, and the water accumulated in the tunnel was mixed with stone powder and silt, becoming deeper and deeper, resembling a thick pot of rice soup. Just as they were starting to drill the bottom holes, Xia Zhendong insisted on crawling into the mud and snatched the rock drill, which weighed more than 20 kilograms, and started operating it. Squad Leader Lai anxiously thought that the chief's health was weak and he wouldn't be able to withstand this, so he quickly said, "Comrade Xia Zhendong, you go and transport the slag." However, Xia Zhendong continued to operate with all his might. Finally, taking advantage of the moment he changed the drill bit, Squad Leader Lai snatched the rock drill back. At this time, Xia Zhendong immediately picked up a trolley to transport the slag. Before long, he was sweating profusely and his face was covered with mud. But he didn't care at all and turned around to prepare to load explosives for blasting.

After work, Squad Leader Lai's mind was still replaying the scene of the "old private" Xia Zhendong crawling in the water operating the rock drill. He thought about it, feeling both moved and distressed. Suddenly, soldier Zhu Hongxian playfully said to him, "You usually rush to do any heavy work, and if someone doesn't listen, you give orders. How about today? Orders don't work in front of the 'old soldier,' right!" This remark sparked a fierce ideological struggle in the squad leader's mind: disobeying orders should be criticized; but he is a veteran Red Army soldier, a former chief, how can I criticize him?

During the evening critique, after Squad Leader Lai finished talking about the advantages and disadvantages of the work, he repeated himself over and over again, hesitating for a long time before finally making up his mind and saying, "Some individual comrades did not follow the assignment." Xia Zhendong was carefully listening to the squad leader's critique, comparing and examining himself. When he heard the squad leader say this, he immediately realized that this was a criticism of him. As soon as the squad leader finished speaking, he raised his hand and reported, "I was wrong. A soldier must obey orders under any circumstances. I didn't do that today, and I gladly accept the criticism. But please, Squad Leader and comrades, from now on, treat me as an ordinary soldier in labor and work." Comrade Xia Zhendong's spirit of self-criticism deeply moved all the comrades in the squad. Everyone gazed at this ordinary soldier with boundless admiration.

    六班长的难题
    某部夏振东政委，到三连当兵了。连里决定他到第六作业班。刚进门，一眼就望见了六班长来锡根，并立即向他来了个举手礼。六班长楞住了，连还礼也忘掉了。好一会，他才吞吞吐吐地说：“首长，您来了。”“不，我是您班的兵，以后叫我夏振东。”
    过去，来锡根当过夏振东的警卫员，有时，遇到难解决的问题，还在首长面前哭鼻子；今天，要当这位老红军的“顶头上司”，总觉得有些不方便。夏振东早把班长的心思看出了八九分，心想一定不能叫班长为难。从到班上那天起，就事事领先，样样带头。一有空，还给同志们读报、教歌、讲战斗故事。班上非常活跃，工作互相抢着干，班长也不再因为夏振东在班里当兵，而感到拘束了。相反的，倒觉得他给班上带来了巨大力量，一切都像有了个靠山。大家也都很关心这位老“列兵”。唯恐累坏了他，太重的活总是尽量不让他干。有一天，六班正在作业，坑道的积水，掺上了石粉和泥沙，愈来愈深，活像一锅稠米汤。正当打底眼的时候，夏振东争着爬在泥浆里，夺过二十多公斤重的钻岩机，就操作起来。六班长着急地想，首长身体很弱，这怎么能受得了，连忙说：“夏振东同志，你去运碴。”可是，夏振东仍然一股劲地操作着。最后，还是趁着他换眼的时候，六班长才把钻岩机夺过来。这时，夏振东又立即拿起推车去运碴。不一会，弄得汗水直流，满脸泥污。但他毫不在意，回头又准备去装药爆破。
    下班以后，六班长脑子里还在回旋着“老列兵”夏振东爬在水里操作钻岩机的情景。他想着，内心里又是感动，又是痛惜。突然，战士朱洪献调皮地对他说：“平时有个什么重活你都抢着干，一不听，就下命令；今天怎么样，命令在‘老兵’面前不好使了吧！”他这一说不要紧，却使班长起了激烈的思想斗争：不服从命令，应该受到批评；可是，他是老红军，老首长，这怎么批评呢？
    晚上讲评的时候，六班长把作业中的优缺点讲完以后，又重复过来重复过去，犹豫了好久，才下定了决心，说：“有个别同志不听从分配。”夏振东正在仔细地听着班长的讲评，对照检查自己，当他听到班长这么一说，马上意识到这是批评自己。班长刚刚讲完，他就举起手来报告说：“我错了。一个军人，在任何情况下都要听从指挥，今天我没有作到，我愉快地接受批评。但是请班长和同志们，今后在劳动上、工作上，都按照普通一兵来要求我。”夏振东同志的自我批评精神，深深地感动了全班的同志。大家都以无限敬佩的心情，凝视着这位普通一兵。
