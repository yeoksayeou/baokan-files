Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 27th: Sichuan province's sugar industry is actively promoting advanced experiences and carrying out technological innovations to improve sugar production and quality.

In Neijiang Prefecture, a key sugar-producing area in the province, the original hundred or so native sugar mills have universally adopted steel-axle stone rollers for sugar production, thereby improving production efficiency. In many small sugar mills in other prefectures, a sugarcane leaching sugar production method that can increase the sugar extraction rate is currently being promoted. This sugar production method does not require pressing sugarcane and the equipment is simple, only requiring a shredder made of ordinary wood and a small amount of thin steel sheets. This method is very suitable for small sugar mills run by people's communes.

All mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar mills in Sichuan Province have also universally launched technological innovation campaigns, adopting advanced sugar production experiences from various regions and improving sugar production tools. Many sugar mills are universally promoting a sugarcane residue roller feeder, which can increase the pressing volume by about 18%. Workers at the Neijiang Sugar Mill also created a sugar boiling instrument called the sugar boiling pan. Workers use the sugar boiling pan to control the saturation of the sugar solution, greatly improving the total sugar recovery rate. In addition, all sugar mills are strengthening the management of production processes such as clarification, boiling sugar, separation, and crystal promotion to improve the total sugar recovery rate and increase sugar production.

To improve the quality of sugar, many sugar mills are currently taking measures to reduce the moisture and impurities in the granulated sugar. Many native sugar mills have strengthened the cleanliness and hygiene of sugar production, using wooden filter presses for filtration and thin-liquid sugar boiling methods to gradually make native sugar workshops continuous in production, to improve the purity of brown sugar.

    四川积极推广制糖先进经验
    食糖产量质量齐飞跃
    新华社重庆27日电　四川省制糖工业部门积极推广先进经验，进行技术革新，以提高食糖的产量和质量。
    在全省产糖重点的内江专区，原有的一百多家土糖厂已经普遍采用钢轴石辊制糖，从而提高了生产效率。在其它各专区的许多小糖厂里，目前都在推广一种可以提高出糖率的甘蔗浸出制糖法。这种制糖法不用压榨甘蔗，设备简单，只需一个用普通木料和少许薄钢片做成的切丝机就行。这种方法很适用于人民公社办小糖厂。
    四川省各个机制糖厂和半机械化的制糖厂，也都普遍开展了技术革新运动，采用各地制糖的先进经验和改进制糖工具。不少糖厂正在普遍推行一种蔗渣入辊器，它可以提高压榨量18％左右。内江糖厂的职工还创造了一种煮糖仪表，名叫煮糖盘。工人们用煮糖盘掌握糖液的饱和度，大大提高了糖份的总收回率。此外，各个糖厂都正在加强沉清、煮糖、分蜜、助晶等生产过程的管理工作，以提高糖的总收回率，增加糖的产量。
    为了提高糖的质量，目前许多糖厂正在从减少砂糖的水份和夹杂物等方面采取措施。不少土糖厂加强了制糖的清洁卫生工作，采用木制压滤机过滤和薄液煮糖等方法，逐步使土糖坊生产连续化，以提高红糖的纯度。（附图片）
