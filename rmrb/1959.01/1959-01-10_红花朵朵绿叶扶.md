Red Blossoms Supported by Green Leaves
　　Kong Sang

　　People eat one mouthful at a time. Eating one mouthful and then another ensures good digestion. Building factories is the same; build them in batches. Building one batch and then another ensures the new factories are quickly put into production. The experience of construction in the past few years has repeatedly proven this point. The news published in this newspaper today about the accelerated progress of a batch of key projects in Shandong Province is another proof.

　　Since we are to build in batches, construction must have a focus; build the important ones first, and the less important ones later. What is important and what is less important will, of course, be determined by the time and the place. But no matter when and where, having a focus means having a non-focus (general), having a first means having a last, having those who are supported means having those who support. There are many departments across the country, and each department has many industries. The country has more than twenty provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and each province, municipality and autonomous region has many special districts and counties. Who is the focus? Who is the general? Who is first? Who is last? Who is supported? Who is the supporter? This depends on the role of the construction project in the specific development stage of the entire national economy. Projects with a large role, a large impact, and urgent needs are the focus and should be prioritized. Projects with a relatively small role, a relatively small impact, and not very urgent needs are non-focus and should be ranked lower. Taking the current situation as an example, departments such as steel, machinery, electricity, and transportation are important links to ensure the high-speed development of the entire national economy, so they are the focus of construction and should be ranked at the forefront.

　　However, not every construction project in key departments is a key project, and not every project in other departments is a non-key project. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) and Baotou Steel are key projects, and we must fully guarantee that they get started first and support them in running fast. But some of their non-productive buildings may not be key projects. Compared with heavy industries such as steel and machinery, light industry is a non-key project, but when cotton production doubles, while the production capacity of the textile industry is far from being able to adapt, the construction of some textile factories becomes a key project. Other departments, such as chemical industry and building materials, are neither "marshals" nor "pioneers," but some of their projects will also be listed as key projects. There are general projects within key projects, and key projects within general projects. When ranking basic construction projects, we must ensure that we do not miss the real key projects, and we must also prevent non-key projects from posing as key projects. We must not only guarantee the key projects, but also take care of the general projects, especially the key projects within the general projects. Combining guaranteeing key projects and taking care of general projects can enable the national economy to develop at high speed, and also ensure that each department maintains appropriate proportional relationships, and achieve an all-round leap forward.

　　Is there a contradiction between key and non-key, first and last? Yes, there is. In order to guarantee key projects, the construction of general projects in non-key and general areas cannot proceed simultaneously, which is the contradiction. But from the perspective of long-term development, letting key projects and key areas take the lead will enable them to in turn support general projects and general areas, and open up the road for the entire national economy to advance by leaps and bounds. It's like a million-strong army crossing the river, letting some people go over first to build bridges and roads, so that the people and horses behind can pass quickly. This is the unity of the contradiction between key and non-key, first and last. This is the reason why key projects should be vigorously supported.

　　Mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties and treating the entire country as a single chessboard is also a unity of opposites. We must greatly promote the spirit of communist cooperation and vigorously support the construction of key projects and key areas. But on the premise of guaranteeing key projects and supporting key projects, we must also rationally arrange general construction projects needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and we must not ignore them. In this way, in our great construction garden, there will not only be red blossoms, but also lush green leaves.

    红花朵朵绿叶扶
    孔桑
    人们吃饭都是一口一口吃的，吃了一口再吃一口，这样才消化得好。建设工厂也一样，要一批一批的建，建了一批再建一批，才能保证新厂迅速投入生产。这个道理，过去几年建设的实践，已经一再证明过了，今天本报发表的山东省一批重点工程进度加快的消息，又是一次证明。
    既然要一批一批地建，建设就得有重点，先建重要的，后建次要的。重要和次要，当然会因时因地而定。但不论何时何地，有重点就有非重点（一般），有先就有后，有被支援的就有支援的。全国有许多部门，每一个部门又有许多行业，全国有二十几个省市区，每一个省市区又有许多专区和县，谁是重点？谁是一般？谁在先？谁在后？谁是被支援的？谁是支援的？这就看建设工程在整个国民经济具体发展阶段的作用了。作用大、影响大，而又是迫切需要的，就是重点，就该排在前头；作用比较小、影响比较小，不很迫切需要的，就是非重点，就该往后排一排。拿当前的情况来说，钢铁、机械、电力、交通等部门，是保证整个国民经济高速度发展的重要环节，所以就是建设的重点，就该排在最前面。
    然而，在重点部门也并非每一个建设项目都是重点，其他部门的项目也并非都是非重点。武钢、包钢是重点，我们要全力保证它们先上马，支援它们快跑。但它们的某些非生产性建筑就不一定是重点。轻工业跟钢铁、机械等重工业比起来，是非重点，但在棉花产量翻一番，而纺织工业的生产能力又远远不能相适应的时候，某些纺织厂的建设，就成为重点。其它如化工、建筑材料等部门，它们既非“元帅”，也非“先行”，但它们中间也有些工程会列为重点。重点中有一般，一般中有重点。在进行基本建设项目排队的时候，要做到不漏掉真正的重点，又要防止非重点冒充重点。我们既保证重点，又要照顾一般，特别是照顾一般中的重点。保证重点和照顾一般相结合，就可以使国民经济高速度发展，又可以保证各部门保持适当的比例关系，全面跃进。
    重点与非重点，先与后，有没有矛盾呢？有的。为了保证重点，非重点的一般工程、一般地区的建设，就不可能同时并进，这就是矛盾。但从长远的发展看，让重点工程、重点地区先走一步，它就可以反过去支援一般工程、一般地区，为整个国民经济大踏步前进开拓道路。好比百万雄师过河，让一些人先过去搭桥修路，后面的人马就可以很快过去了。这就是重点与非重点、先与后矛盾的统一。对于重点工程应当大力支援的道理就在这里。
    调动各方面的积极性和全国一盘棋，也是对立的统一。我们要大大发扬共产主义的协作精神，大力支援重点工程、重点地区的建设。但在保证重点，支援重点的前提下，对国计民生所需要的一般建设项目，我们也要合理安排，不能忽视。这样，我们的建设大花园里，就不仅是红花朵朵，而且绿叶繁茂。
