Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, 7th - The U.S. government admitted yesterday that the United States did "possess weapons for conducting germ warfare" during the Korean War and had transported a "limited number of chemical warfare weapons to the Far East."

This news was unintentionally revealed by U.S. Assistant Attorney General Schnack in a so-called "affidavit." Schnack submitted this "affidavit" to prevent the Powell couple from accessing government secret records in order to expose the government's "accusations" against them.

The Powell couple had published the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai. During the Korean War, they published materials in the newspaper exposing the U.S.'s crimes of conducting germ warfare, which infuriated the U.S. ruling group. In 1953, when they returned to the United States, the U.S. government persecuted them on charges of "sedition."

The Powell couple's request caused great panic among the U.S. ruling group. Fearing that the truth would be revealed, Schnack presented the "affidavit" in an attempt to deny it. He said that although the United States had transported a "limited number" of chemical weapons to the Far East, this was only for "training." He requested the court not to allow the Powell couple to obtain government secret records because he believed that publishing such a report would greatly harm "national security."

### 美政府承认  美国在朝鲜战争的期间曾把细菌武器运来远东

    美政府承认
    美国在朝鲜战争的期间曾把细菌武器运来远东
    新华社7日讯　旧金山消息：美国政府昨天承认在朝鲜战争期间美国的确“拥有进行细菌战争的武器”，并且曾经把“数量有限的化学战武器运往远东”。
    这个消息是美国助理司法部长施纳克在一份所谓“宣誓书”上无意中透露出来的。施纳克提出这份“宣誓书”的目的是为了阻止鲍惠尔夫妇提出的关于调阅政府的秘密记录以便揭穿政府对他们的“控告”的要求。
    鲍惠尔夫妇曾在上海发行过“密勒氏评论报”，在朝鲜战争期间，他们曾在报上发表材料揭发美国进行细菌战争的罪行，因而美国统治集团恼羞成怒。1953年当他们回国后，美国政府便以所谓“煽动叛乱罪”对他们进行迫害。
    鲍惠尔夫妇这一要求使美国统治集团大为恐慌，由于害怕真相毕露，施纳克就提出什么“宣誓书”企图抵赖。他说美国虽然曾经把“数量有限的”化学武器运往远东，但这只是用来进行“训练”。他要求法院不准鲍惠尔夫妇取得政府的秘密记录，因为他认为发表这种报告将对“国家安全”有很大损害。
