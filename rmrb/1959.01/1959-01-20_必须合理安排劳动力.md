    After the realization of people's communes in rural areas across the country, a new production upsurge is taking shape. This year's winter production tasks are much more enormous and complex than last year's.
    According to the guidelines determined by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, people's communes should simultaneously promote industry and agriculture, simultaneously promote self-sufficient production and commodity production, and achieve comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Currently, most regions across the country are beginning to organize production in accordance with these guidelines. However, in some places, in some specific measures, especially in the allocation of labor power, this is not fully adapted to these guidelines.
    It should be recognized that whether the arrangement of rural labor power is reasonable is not only related to whether the development of agricultural production itself can maintain an appropriate proportion, but it also inevitably relates to whether the development of the entire national economy can maintain an appropriate proportion. For example, if some people's communes relax the arrangement of labor power on the transportation front, it will affect the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; if some people's communes neglect the production of certain daily necessities, it will affect the supply to the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas. This principle is easy for everyone to understand. Of course, rationally arranging rural labor power is not an easy task. Sometimes, due to focusing attention on a few particularly urgent primary tasks while neglecting some relatively secondary aspects, it is difficult to avoid in the case of insufficient experience. However, once the problem is discovered, it must be taken seriously and strive for a reasonable solution.
    At present, in the people's communes, it is necessary to build water conservancy projects, accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, prepare for spring plowing, develop diversified operations, participate in industrial and transportation construction, and manage overwintering crops. It should be said that these tasks are quite complex and arduous. Under these circumstances, how to arrange labor power has become the most pressing issue. Whether the enthusiasm of the broad masses can be further brought into play and whether a comprehensive great leap forward can be guaranteed this year depends first and foremost on whether this problem can be solved well. One of the most significant advantages of the people's commune is that labor power can be arranged and deployed uniformly on a larger scale, used more rationally and effectively than before, and thus more conducive to the comprehensive development of production. Precisely because of this, people's communes need to pay more attention to rationally arranging labor power.
    How can people's communes arrange labor power appropriately? On the one hand, people's communes must see the overall situation and the whole; that is to say, they must correctly implement the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, simultaneously promoting commodity production and self-sufficient production, and achieving comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. On the other hand, it is also necessary to distinguish between the important and the urgent; that is to say, the principles of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the time should be grasped flexibly. These two aspects must be well integrated to rationally allocate labor power.
    Currently, from these two perspectives, how should the labor power of the people's communes be deployed? There are three areas that particularly need a large increase in labor power:
    First, sideline production. Agricultural production achieved a great harvest last year. However, sideline production is still a relatively weak link. Greatly developing sideline production can increase market supply, meet the diverse needs of urban and rural people's lives, and further expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; it can enable communes to have more cash income to add production materials and improve the lives of members, and further consolidate the people's communes. In accordance with the policy of simultaneously promoting self-sufficient production and commodity production, and in accordance with the policy of achieving comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, a necessary amount of labor power should be invested in sideline production. We must seize the opportunity of one to two months before spring plowing, especially before the Spring Festival, to launch a mass movement for sideline production.
    Second, accumulate and manufacture fertilizer. "Fertilizer" is the second article of the "Eight-Point Charter" and is an extremely important material foundation for ensuring a great leap forward in agricultural production. Some areas have already accumulated more fertilizer since the beginning of winter than in the same period last year, and have also manufactured a lot of local fertilizer, and are continuing to work hard to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, which is very necessary. However, on a national scale, this work still needs to be greatly strengthened, and the team for accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer needs to be expanded. This year, dense planting is universally implemented throughout the country, and crops are planted more densely than in the past in the original dense planting areas; the land is also cultivated deeper. Therefore, much more fertilizer is needed than last year to meet the needs of topdressing overwintering crops and applying base fertilizer to spring sowing crops, and to ensure a much greater harvest than last year. The people's communes must seize the opportunity and take out enough labor power to launch a shock movement to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer.
    Third, field management. This year, there are more than 400 million mu of winter wheat and other overwintering crops; the innate conditions of these crops are better than last year, but it is absolutely impossible to relax cultivation; and some measures before and during sowing have not been done very well. Topdressing, winter irrigation, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests for overwintering crops are current urgent tasks. The first key to striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture this year is to strive for a greater harvest of summer crops than last year. And to achieve this, doing a good job in field management of overwintering crops is of great significance.
    The above three aspects are relatively weak links in current rural production and require immediate strengthening of leadership and addition of labor power. Judging from the recent situation, many regions have already noticed this problem. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee has made comprehensive arrangements for the current rural work and has instructed all localities to draw one-quarter to one-third of the labor force to form professional teams to invest in the fertilizer accumulation upsurge; in terms of sideline production, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements, especially to focus on the production of non-staple foods, agricultural product processing, local sugar making, hunting, promoting fattening pigs, etc.; and to do a good job in other spring plowing preparation work. Such arrangements are very necessary. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee has also instructed all localities to rationally arrange labor power; by early January, Xiangyang Prefecture had more than 800,000 people invested in field management centered on topdressing, 300,000 people invested in sideline production, and the accumulation of fertilizer had been completed at 2.4 billion dan. Other places should also do this. Some comrades in some areas have not paid enough attention to the work in these areas and are still excessively concentrating the labor power of the people's communes in other areas. They should quickly and resolutely take measures to readjust the labor power.
    To add labor power in the three aspects of sideline occupations, fertilizer accumulation, and field management, it is necessary to appropriately reduce labor power in other aspects. Judging from the current national situation, labor power can be drawn from the following aspects:
    First, in terms of water conservancy construction. It is of course very necessary to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction; in the past, especially last year, great achievements have been made in this regard, which has played a huge role in ensuring increased production. Making fuller and more reasonable use of these projects will enable them to play a greater role in the future. Of course, new water conservancy projects should still be carried out on a large scale and well this year; however, from a global perspective, too many should not be done. The amount of earthwork to be done this year is equivalent to last year, or about the same as last year, which is already quite a lot and a great leap forward. Some comrades feel that since this year's leap forward is going to be greater than last year's, then more water conservancy projects should be built. These comrades do not understand that this year's situation is different from last year's, and what needs to leap forward is not only water conservancy construction, but also a comprehensive leap forward in many other aspects. This year's winter production will be broader. This requires that the labor power invested in water conservancy construction not only cannot be more than last year, but also less than last year. It is true that water conservancy projects are the basic construction of farmland, and it is a good thing to do more water conservancy projects, but we cannot complete all the good things in one or two years. If labor power is excessively concentrated in this aspect, from this aspect, the progress is accelerated for a while; however, this will inevitably relax other aspects, which is unfavorable from a comprehensive perspective. Therefore, except for provinces with too little irrigated area, the tasks of water conservancy construction and the labor power used may be reduced. Of course, the people who stay on the water conservancy construction sites must not slacken at all, but must show even greater effort, starting from reforming tools, innovating technology, and improving labor organization, and make the greatest effort to improve work efficiency and complete more tasks in a shorter time with less manpower.
    Second, in terms of deep plowing of land. Since last autumn, the area of deeply plowed land has reached 700 million mu, which is unprecedented in history. The work of deep plowing should continue in places where less deep plowing has been done. However, the amount of labor power invested in this area must also be appropriate. If there is too much, it will also have an adverse effect on comprehensive development. In the case where deep plowing tools have not been manufactured in large quantities, the depth of plowing may be temporarily controlled at about one foot, and if it cannot be reached, a depth of seven or eight inches is also acceptable, and can be deepened year by year in the future. It is also appropriate to rotate deep plowing once every three years, that is to say, only one-third of the arable land is deeply plowed in one year.
    Third, in terms of smelting steel. The "small local furnace" steel production has already achieved great success, and it must be adhered to and gradually improved in the future. It should be noted that one of the benefits of "small local furnace" steelmaking is that it can adapt to the needs of people's communes to flexibly allocate labor power, and can "start up" and "shut down" at any time. When agriculture needs it, a part of the labor force can be drawn from the steel front to the agricultural front. At the same time, the "small local furnace" should also strive to save labor power, and one of the important methods is to develop towards the "small modern furnace." As for some places where the conditions of resources and fuel are not good and the cost is too high and very uneconomical, they should be stopped sooner and the labor power transferred to other aspects. The people who stay on the steel front still have to muster their efforts, become skilled through practice, and strive to produce more and better steel with reduced manpower.
    In short, in the current winter production, it is necessary to have a global perspective, to be good at distinguishing which are urgent things and which are long-term things; which things should be grasped quickly and which things may be done slowly; to see the situation clearly, like fighting a war, and to resolutely and flexibly reallocate labor power as the battle situation changes. Not long ago, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting considered the needs of water conservancy construction and the needs of various agricultural activities in the province, resolutely made appropriate adjustments to the water conservancy tasks and projects, and drew labor power to strengthen fertilizer accumulation, commodity production, field management, and other work; at the same time, it strengthened political leadership, rationally organized labor, and vigorously promoted technological innovation in water conservancy. Doing so just grasped the key to the work. Hebei Province originally planned to build twelve larger water conservancy projects, and it has now been decided to temporarily start construction on three to four. Yushu County in Jilin Province has already drawn 44,000 of the 120,000 people originally invested in water conservancy projects to the fertilizer accumulation front, expanding the fertilizer accumulation team. Doing so is very necessary.
    Labor power must be arranged in this way in winter production. Later, with the shift of the situation and seasons, labor power should also be mobilized in a timely and flexible manner in accordance with the guidelines determined by the Party Central Committee. In order to implement the production policy of the people's communes more proactively and comprehensively, it is best for each county and each people's commune to formulate a year-round labor plan while formulating a production plan during the consolidation of the commune. Calculate clearly the labor power required to complete the tasks in all aspects, and make unified arrangements for all the labor power. With such a plan, it is possible to have a clear idea and to maximize the role of each labor force in the most rational way. Of course, when calculating labor power, it is impossible to stick to the old habits of the past. It should be understood that how much a labor force can do is not fixed. With the reform of production tools, the improvement of labor organization, and the improvement of people's awareness, labor efficiency can be increased exponentially. The facts of the great leap forward in our country last year vividly illustrate this point. However, under certain conditions, the发挥 of subjective initiative has a certain limit. If too much labor power is used in a certain aspect or several aspects, it will inevitably make other aspects feel a shortage of labor power. This will make the entire economic life lose its due relative balance. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve investigation and research and grasp the laws that should be followed when allocating labor power. In this way, it will be possible to give fuller play to the role of labor power and realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    必须合理安排劳动力
    全国农村实现人民公社化以后，一个新的生产高潮正在形成。今年冬季生产的任务，比上一年要巨大得多、复杂得多。
    根据党的八届六中全会确定的方针，人民公社要实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，农林牧副渔全面发展。现在，全国绝大部分地区正在按照这个方针着手组织生产。但是，在有些地方，在一些具体措施上，特别是在劳动力的调配方面，同这个方针还不是完全适应。
    应当看到：农村劳动力的安排是否合理，不但关系到农业生产本身的发展能否保持适当的比例，而且也必然关系到整个国民经济的发展能否保持适当的比例。举例来说，如果某些人民公社放松了运输战线上的劳动力的安排，就会影响城乡物资的交流；如果某些人民公社忽视了某些生活必需品的生产，就会影响对城乡广大人民的供应。这个道理，是大家容易了解的。当然，合理安排农村劳动力并不是一件轻而易举的事。有时由于集中注意于某几项特别紧急的首要的任务，而忽视了某些较为次要的方面，在经验不足的情况下，也是难以避免的。但是，在问题一经发现以后，就必须认真对待，力求合理解决。
    目前，在人民公社里，既要兴修水利，又要积肥造肥，既要准备春耕，又要发展多种经营，既要参加工业交通建设，又要管理过冬作物，应当说，这些任务是相当复杂、相当繁重的。在这种情况下，怎样安排劳动力，成为一个最迫切的问题。能不能进一步发挥广大群众积极性，能不能保证今年全面大跃进，首先就看能不能很好地解决这个问题。人民公社的最显著的优越性之一，就是劳动力可以在更大的范围内作统一的安排和调度，可以比以前更合理更有效地使用，因而更便于全面地发展生产。正因为如此，人民公社就需要用比较大的注意力来合理地安排劳动力。
    人民公社怎样才能把劳动力安排得恰到好处？一方面，人民公社必须看到全局和整体；也就是说，必须正确地执行工业和农业、商品性生产和自给性生产同时并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的方针。另一方面，还要分清轻重缓急；也就是说，应当灵活地掌握因地制宜、因时制宜的原则。要把这两方面很好地结合起来，合理地调配劳动力。
    目前，从这两方面来看，人民公社的劳动力应该怎样调度呢？有三个方面特别需要大量地增添劳动力：
    一是副业生产。去年农业生产获得了大丰收。但是副业生产还是比较薄弱的环节。大大发展副业生产，就能增加市场供应，适应城乡人民生活多方面的需要，进一步扩大城乡物资交流；就能使公社有更多的现金收入，以增添生产资料和改善社员生活，进一步巩固人民公社。按照自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，按照农林牧副渔全面发展的方针，都应该在副业生产方面投入必要数量的劳动力。要抓紧春耕以前一个月到两个月的时机，特别是春节以前的时机，开展一个群众性的副业生产运动。
    二是积肥造肥。“肥”是“八字宪法”中的第二条，是保证农业生产大跃进的极其重要的物质基础。一些地区入冬以来已经积了比去年同期更多的肥料，还制造了很多土化肥，并且正在继续努力大力积肥造肥，这是非常必要的。但是，就全国范围来说，这个工作还需要大大加强，积肥造肥的队伍还需要扩大。今年全国各地都普遍实行密植，原来密植的地方庄稼种得比过去更密；土地耕得也更深了。因此，要有比去年多得多的肥料，才能适应过冬作物施追肥和春播作物施底肥的需要，保证获得比去年更大得多的丰收。人民公社必须抓紧时机，拿出足够的劳动力来开展一个突击积肥造肥运动。
    三是田间管理。今年冬小麦和别的过冬作物共有四亿多亩；这些作物的先天条件比去年好，但是，决不可因此就放松培育；而且播种前和播种时的一些措施也并不是都做得很好了。给过冬作物追肥、冬灌、防治病虫害，这是当前迫切的工作。今年争取农业更大更好更全面的跃进的第一个关键，就是要争取夏收作物比去年有更大的丰收。而要达到这一点，做好过冬作物的田间管理有着重大的意义。
    上述的三个方面，是当前农村生产中比较薄弱的环节，需要立即加强领导，增添劳动力。从最近的情况看来，不少地区已经注意到这个问题。甘肃省委对当前农村工作作了全面安排，已经指示各地可以抽调四分之一到三分之一的劳动力组成专业队投入积肥高潮；在副业生产方面也要大搞群众运动，特别要抓副食品生产、农产品加工、土法制糖、打猎、催育肥猪等等；还要做好其他各项春耕准备工作。这样的安排十分必要。湖北省委也已经指示各地合理安排劳力；到一月上旬，襄阳专区已有八十多万人投入以追肥为中心的田间管理，三十万人投入副业生产，积肥已完成二十四亿担。别的地方也应该这样做。有些地区的同志们对于这几个方面的工作还没有给予足够的注意，仍然把人民公社的劳动力过分地集中在别的方面，应当赶快坚决地采取措施，把劳动力重新加以调整。
    要在副业、积肥和田间管理这三方面增添劳动力，就必须在其他方面适当减少劳动力。从目前全国的情况看来，可以从下述几个方面抽调劳动力：
    一是水利建设方面。大规模地兴修水利当然是十分必要的；过去，特别是去年，在这方面已经有了巨大的成就，对于保证增产起了巨大的作用。把这些工程更充分地更合理地利用起来，今后就能发挥更大的作用。今年，新的水利工程当然还是应该大搞、搞好；但是，从全局看来，不可搞得过多。今年要做的土石方，相当于去年、或者同去年差不多，就已经够多了，也是很大的跃进了。有些同志觉得，今年既然要比去年跃进更大，那末水利工程也就要修得更多。这些同志不了解，今年的形势不同于去年，需要跃进的不仅是水利建设，还要有其他许多方面的全面跃进。今年冬季生产的方面要更广。这就要求投入水利建设的劳动力，不仅不能比去年多，而且要比去年少。不错，水利工程是农田的基本建设，多搞水利工程是好事情，可是，我们也不可能把所有的好事在一两年内办完。如果把劳动力过分地集中在这个方面，从这一方面来看，一时进度是加快了；可是，这就势必放松了其他方面，从全面来说是不利的。因此，除了灌溉面积还太少的省份以外，水利建设的任务和使用的劳动力不妨减少一些。当然，留在水利工地的人们一点也不可松劲，而要拿出更大的干劲来，从改革工具、革新技术、改进劳动组织等方面着手，尽最大努力提高工作效率，用较少的人力在较短的时间内完成较多的任务。
    二是深翻土地方面。去年秋天以来，深耕地的面积已经达到七亿亩，在历史上是空前的。深翻地搞得较少的地方，也还应该继续进行这个工作。但是，在这方面投入的劳动力的数量也必须适当。如果过多了，对于全面发展也会有不利的影响。在深耕工具还没有大量制造出来的情况下，耕翻的深度不妨暂时控制在一尺左右，达不到的话，七寸八寸深也可以，以后可以逐年加深。深耕的面积，三年轮一次也就可以了，也就是说一年只深耕三分之一的耕地是适当的。
    三是冶炼钢铁方面。“小土群”的钢铁生产已经获得了巨大的成就，今后也必须坚持和逐步提高。应当注意的是，“小土群”办钢铁的好处之一，正是能适应人民公社灵活调配劳力的需要，随时可以“上马”，也随时可以“下马”。在农业上有必要时，就可以从钢铁战线上抽出一部分劳动力到农业战线上去。同时，“小土群”也要力求节省劳动力，重要方法之一就是向“小洋群”发展。至于有些地方，资源和燃料的条件都不好，成本过高，很不合算，应该快些停下来，把劳动力转移到其他方面去。留在钢铁战线上的人们，仍然要鼓足干劲，熟中生巧，在人力减少的情况下争取生产更多更好的钢铁。
    总之，在目前冬季生产中要有全局观点，要善于分辨哪是急迫的事情，哪是长远的事情；哪些事情应该快抓，哪些事情不妨缓办；要看清形势，像打仗一样，随着战局的变化，果断而灵活地重新调配劳动力。不久以前，湖南省委扩大会议考虑了全省兴修水利的需要和各项农事活动的需要，坚决地把水利任务和项目作了适当的调整，抽调劳动力加强了积肥造肥、商品生产、田间管理等工作；同时在水利方面加强政治领导、合理组织劳力、大搞技术革新。这样做，正好抓住了工作中的关键。河北省原拟修建十二个较大的水利工程，现在已决定暂时先开工三个到四个。吉林省榆树县已经把原来投入水利工程的十二万人，抽调四万四千人转到积肥战线上，扩大了积肥队伍。这样做都是非常必要的。
    在冬季生产中，劳动力必须这样安排。以后，随着形势和季节的转换，还应该根据党中央确定的方针，及时地灵活地调动劳动力。为了更主动更全面地贯彻执行人民公社的生产方针，各县各人民公社最好在整社中制订生产规划的同时，制订全年的劳动规划。把完成各方面的任务所需要的劳动力计算清楚，并且将全部劳动力加以统一安排。有了这样的规划，就可以做到心中有数，能最合理地最大限度地发挥每个劳动力的作用。当然，在计算劳动力的时候，不可拘泥于过去的老习惯。应当了解：一个劳动力究竟能做多少事，这并不是固定不变的。随着生产工具的改革、劳动组织的改善、人们觉悟程度的提高，劳动效率能够成倍地提高。去年我国大跃进的事实生动地说明了这一点。但是，在一定条件下主观能动性的发挥总有一定的限度。在某一方面或者某几方面使用的劳动力过多了，必然会使别的方面感到劳动力不足。这就会使整个经济生活失去应有的相对的平衡。因此，必须更进一步做好调查研究工作，掌握住调配劳动力时所应当遵循的规律。这样，就能够越来越充分地发挥劳动力的作用，实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
