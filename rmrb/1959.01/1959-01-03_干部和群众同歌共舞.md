Cadres and Masses Sing and Dance Together
Hai Bo

The "Regulations on Several Tasks to Improve the Current People's Livelihood" approved and transmitted by the CCP Central Committee from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee is an important document at present. Every provision in this regulation is vivid, lively, and urgently needed. One of them is particularly interesting; it reads: "During the intervals of intense labor, cadres leading singing and dancing is a good form of rest and a good opportunity to carry out propaganda and mobilization work." At first glance, this may seem unrelated to caring for people's lives and a bit stiff, but in fact, it is a wonderful provision.

Everyone knows that Hong'an County in Hubei Province does a good job in everything, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is also very harmonious. From the first secretary of the county party committee and the propaganda minister to the commune cadres, everyone not only cultivated experimental plots and worked with the masses, but also knew how to perform Lianhualao, storytelling, and singing. They often sang with the broad masses during labor intervals and used these activities to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. When they sang, the masses sang and performed along, so the masses and cadres naturally formed a socialist choir. Like soldiers, they often sang battle songs and went to fields and construction sites.

This matter illustrates a problem: entertaining with the masses has always been valued as a method of connecting with the masses.

Our cadres come from the people and are for the people. They have always had flesh-and-blood ties with the people, especially after the rectification campaign, this connection has become even deeper. However, many places still lack one thing, which is not yet being entertaining together.

Some intellectuals see the things that the masses sing as low-level, and they sing in a "foreign accent," unwilling to sing "local tunes" with the masses, that is to say, they can't let go of the stinky airs of intellectuals. This is one of the reasons for not entertaining with the masses. In fact, these people still lack the feelings of the masses and do not care about the inner voices of the masses. Of course, the things of the masses need to be improved, but the basis of improvement is first to lead this work and carry out popularization work.

Others think this is a trivial matter and not worth mentioning. This is another reason for not entertaining with the masses. The example of Hong'an County shows that cadres leading the masses in singing is not a trivial matter that is unrelated to the Great Leap Forward and painless. It is as important as caring for people's eating and sleeping. Our people are people who can sing and dance. As the poem says: "Not comfortable without singing folk songs, singing folk songs makes me happy, the more production I do, the more energetic I become, and a happy life will come soon." This reflects the diverse life and urgent demands of the masses. Under the leadership of the Party, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the cultural and recreational activities and artistic creations of the Chinese people are like a hundred flowers blooming and shining brightly. The land of poetry is everywhere, and talented poets and singers are everywhere. With the development of production and the improvement of material life, people's demands for spiritual life will become more urgent and diverse, and it will become an important part of people's entire life. It is the responsibility of the cadres to lead it well. And personally leading the masses to sing and dance is a good way to achieve this leadership.

Leading the masses to carry out cultural and recreational activities is a matter of livelihood and a political matter. Every cadre should see it this way and should do it this way.

    干部和群众同歌共舞
    海波
    中共中央批转的中共湖北省委关于作好当前人民生活的几项工作的规定，是当前的一个重要文件。这个规定的每一条都鲜明生动而迫切需要。其中有一条使人感到特别有趣，这一条这样写道：“在紧张劳动的间隙，干部领导歌舞演唱是一种很好的休息，是进行宣传鼓动工作的好机会。”这一条乍一听来，似乎跟关心人民生活关系不大，而且有点生硬，其实，这真是绝妙的一条。
    大家都知道湖北红安县，样样工作都搞得好，干部和群众的关系也十分融洽。从县委第一书记、宣传部长到公社干部，每人不仅种了试验田，和群众同劳动，而且大都会打莲花落、说书、演唱。他们在劳动间隙常同广大群众一起演唱，并通过这些活动进行宣传鼓动工作。他们一唱，群众也跟着唱、跟着演，于是群众和干部自然而然形成了一支社会主义的合唱队。他们经常像战士一样，唱着战歌，奔赴田园和工地。
    这件事说明一个问题：和群众一起娱乐，是向来被人重视的一种联系群众的方法。
    我们的干部是来自人民，为了人民，自来都与人民群众有着血肉联系，特别是整风以后，这种联系更深了一层。但是很多地方还缺少一点，就是还没作到同娱乐。
    有些知识分子出身的人把群众演唱的东西，看作是一种低级的东西，一唱就是“洋腔”，不愿同群众一块唱“土调”，也就是说，还放不下知识分子的臭架子。这是没有同群众同娱乐的原因之一。这种人实际上还缺少群众的感情，不关心群众内心的呼声。当然，群众的东西有待提高，但提高的基础首先是要把这个工作领导起来，进行普及工作。
    还有的人认为这是琐碎小事，不屑一顾。这又是一个没有与群众同娱乐的原因。红安县的例子说明，干部带领群众演唱并不是一件与大跃进无关、无关痛痒的小事，它和关心人民吃饭睡觉一样重要。我们的人民是能歌善舞的人民，有诗为证：“不唱山歌不自在，唱了山歌乐开怀，生产越干越有劲，幸福生活早日来。”这就反映了群众这种丰富多彩的生活和迫切要求。在党的领导下，特别是大跃进以来，我国人民的文娱活动、文艺创造更似百花齐放，大放异彩，诗歌之乡，天才的诗人和歌手比比皆是。随着生产的发展，物质生活的提高，人民对精神生活的要求会更加迫切和多样，它将成为人民整个生活中的重要部分。干部的责任就是要把它领导好。而亲自带领群众歌舞演唱则是实现这种领导的好方法。
    领导群众开展文化娱乐活动，是生活问题，又是政治问题。每个干部都应该这样看，应该这样作。
