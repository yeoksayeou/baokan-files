The Dong Autonomous County of Sanjiang in Guangxi used to have the saying, "Every mountain has its feng shui, and every place has its gods." During the Great Leap Forward in production, the masses of farmers, after great debates, swept away this superstition that had lasted for thousands of years. Mountains were opened, earth was moved, and grain production increased! Now, various villages have many interesting stories circulating. The examples reflected in this column are only a part of them. —Editor

　　
　　Carp Slope Becomes a Treasure Land
　　South of Chengyang Great Village, there is a hillside shaped like a carp. Therefore, people call it Carp Slope. Legend has it that the eight villages of Chengyang are a long dragon, and Carp Slope is a "treasure in front of the dragon." With this treasure, the villages can be safe and sound. Therefore, since ancient times, no one has been allowed to move Carp Slope with a hoe.
　　It was in the winter of 1957 that the call of the Great Leap Forward resounded throughout Chengyang. Chengyang had a large population and little land. To solve the food problem, some wasteland had to be reclaimed. At a mass meeting, someone proposed leveling Carp Slope. The villagers were stunned when they heard this. Yang Tongmao and Wang Laoweng took the lead in opposing it. One said, "If you dig up the 'treasure in front of the dragon,' the village will catch fire and people will die. Whoever moves a hoe will get sick." The other said, "We must be careful when doing things, and the safety of the village is important. We can't be so reckless." The meeting was filled with murmurs, and everyone discussed it. Therefore, the Party branch raised several questions for the villagers to debate: Should we Dong people stick to superstition and backwardness, or should we break superstition and seek progress? Is it better to strive for a thousand-jin county in the Great Leap Forward, or to produce less grain according to the old rules? At the debate, the superstitious faction spoke again: "If a thousand-jin county could be achieved, our ancestors would have done it long ago. Why would they wait for us now!" This worried several activists who had just returned from visiting other places. They couldn't hold back and stood up, saying forcefully: If the Han people can do it, why can't we Dong people do it? One person after another spoke, and the meeting of more than two thousand people became more and more heated, lasting until late at night. Finally, it was unanimously agreed to attack the "treasure in front of the dragon."
　　After the meeting that night, everyone braved the cold wind, carried their hoes, and rushed to Carp Slope. Party Branch Secretary Shi Mingde and Wu Jiasheng, an elderly promoter, dug the first hoe of soil on Carp Slope. Since then, hundreds or even thousands of people have been working here every day. At night, the slope is filled with fire. In a short time, a large part of Carp Slope was cut down. Last year, eighteen acres of cassava and soybeans were planted here, and a small factory was built to use the clay on the slope to make earthen cement. Now, when people in the village mention Carp Slope, the "treasure in front of the dragon," they laugh and say: The dead treasure has become a living treasure. Everything depends on people, not gods!
　　
　　Fragrant Rice by the Wind and Rain Bridge
　　On the Linxi River, there is a tall wind and rain bridge with exquisite structure and unique style. It is a great creation of Dong culture and art. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, many people come here to kowtow and burn incense. People also walk across the bridge quietly, fearing to disturb the "gods." After liberation, although the number of people coming to pray to the gods and burn incense gradually decreased, in the minds of many people, this bridge is still a place of many taboos.
　　At the west end of the bridge, there are thirty-five acres of dry land, which have poor harvests every year. Whoever the agricultural cooperative assigns it to, no one wants it. Later, Communist Party member Yang Yun'gao accepted this piece of land. He thought: There are ditches and canals on the other side of the river, and the crops will naturally grow well with enough water. If we divert the water here, there will be no problem with increasing production. He discussed it with the members of the Youth Red Flag Team, and everyone decided to build a flume right next to the wind and rain bridge. Last spring, they started construction according to their plan. When construction started, some people with superstitious ideas said: "The wooden trough makes a rustling sound, disturbing the gods on the bridge day and night. What if it causes trouble?" The team members were all unconvinced and said: This is obviously a good thing, how could it cause disaster? In this way, they finally built the wooden trough by the bridge. This piece of land used to have a maximum yield of only 480 jin per mu, but last year the early rice averaged more than 1,000 jin per mu. During the harvest season, people sang: Smiling faces on harvest days, piles of grain hitting the clouds, the wind and rain bridge and the drum tower have become warehouses, and they can't hold so much gold!

　　Celebrating the Harvest Above the Bottomless Cave
　　The late rice above the "Bottomless Cave" on the southwest side of Fengchao Village yielded more than 13,800 jin last year, with an average yield of 2,313 jin and 9 liang per mu, which is really a great event!
　　Speaking of the "Bottomless Cave," it has a long story. Legend has it that this used to be a high mountain and deep valley, covered with thorns. The hardworking minority people split mountains and filled gullies, turning the river valley into fertile land. One day, many years later, a farmer was harrowing the field and suddenly sank into the mud and disappeared. Later, his body was found at the "Dragon's Mouth," five miles away. Since then, this field has been constantly flooding, icy cold, and has become a terrible trap. Until 1957, no one knew how deep the field was, and no one dared to cultivate it. People said that there was a man-eating monster inside, and it was called the "Bottomless Cave."
　　The Party's call to break superstition and develop production stimulated the youth's ambition to dare to think and dare to do. Last February, a group of young people braved the severe cold and went to explore the "Bottomless Cave." They carried a long wooden board, tied the four corners with ropes, and put it in the field to float. Hou Bangli and Hou Guangzong sat on the board, probing the depth with bamboo poles, while the others stood on the edge of the field and pulled the ropes. Hou Bangli forcefully inserted the first pole, more than four feet deep into the mud. Later, it reached five feet, eight feet, and the deepest was no more than one zhang. It turned out that the Bottomless Cave still had a bottom. How to transform it? The young people discussed it. They remembered that the Party committee had instructed: Shallow fields can become deep fields, and deep fields can also become shallow fields. They immediately gathered more than sixty people, chiseled rocks, carried mud, and fought hard for five days and nights using the method of "moving mountains and filling the sea," filling the Bottomless Cave to a depth of only three feet. Then, they used red clay mixed with lime and manure to build a good field bottom and planted rice seedlings. In this way, the Bottomless Cave finally put on green clothes. The first season yielded 784 jin per mu. Adding the late rice, these six acres of land, which had not yielded any grain in the past, had an average yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu. In the village, the myth of the "Bottomless Cave" eating people has become a laughing stock for people after dinner.

    侗家村寨变化多
    广西三江侗族自治县，过去曾流传着“山山有风水，处处有神灵”的传说。在生产大跃进中，农民群众经过大争大辩，把这种千百年的迷信忌讳一扫而光。山开了，土动了，粮食增产了！现在，各个村寨流传着许多有趣的故事。这个专栏里所反映的事例，仅是其中的一部分。　　　　　　——编　者
    鲤鱼坡变宝地
    程阳大寨的南面，有个山坡，形状好似鲤鱼。因此，人们都称它为鲤鱼坡。相传程阳八个寨子是一条长龙，鲤鱼坡是个“龙前宝”，有了这个宝，村寨才得平安无事。所以，自古以来鲤鱼坡一锄头也不许动。
    是1957年冬天的时候，大跃进的号角响遍了程阳。程阳人多地少，要解决粮食问题，就必须开垦一些荒地。在一次群众大会上，有人提议挖平鲤鱼坡。社员们猛一听，都怔住了。杨桐茂、王老翁带头反对，一个说：“把‘龙前宝’挖掉，寨子就要失火死人，谁动锄头谁生病。”那一个又说：“做事要小心，寨子安全要紧，不能这么胡乱来。”会场上嘀嘀咕咕，大家七嘴八舌地议论起来。于是，党支部便提出几个问题，让社员们辩论：我们侗族是守住迷信落后好，还是破除迷信求进步好？是大跃进争取千斤县好，还是按老规矩少打粮食好？在辩论会上，迷信派又开腔了：“千斤县要办得到，老祖宗早就办了，还等我们这个时候！”这一说，急坏了刚从外地参观回来的几个积极分子。他们蹩不住站将起来，振振有词地说：汉族能干，我们侗家为什么不能干？发言的人一个接一个，两千多人的大会越辩越热火，直开到深更半夜。最后，一致同意向“龙前宝”进攻。
    当晚散会后，大家便冒着寒风，扛起锄头，朝鲤鱼坡涌去。党支部书记石明德和老年促进派吴家盛，在鲤鱼坡上挖了第一锄土。自此，这里每天都有几百人甚至上千人在劳动。夜晚，坡上一片火光。没有多少日子，就把鲤鱼坡劈掉一大半。去年，这儿种上了十八亩木薯、黄豆，还办起了一座小工厂，利用坡上的粘土制造土水泥。如今，一提起鲤鱼坡这个“龙前宝”，寨里的人便笑道：死宝变活宝，真是万事靠人不靠神啊！
    风雨桥边稻谷香
    林溪河上，有一座高大的风雨桥，结构精美，别具风格，真是侗族文化艺术的一大创造。每逢初一、十五，就有许多人到这里来叩头烧香。人们路过大桥时，也都是轻手轻脚的，惟恐惊动了“神明”。解放以后，虽说来求神上香的人逐渐稀少，但在不少人的心目中，这座大桥仍是百事禁忌之地。
    在大桥的西头，有三十五亩旱地，年年收成不好。农业社分给谁，谁也不乐意要。后来，共产党员杨云高，把这块地接受了下来。他想：河那边有沟有渠，水足庄稼自然长得好，要是把水引过来，增产就没有问题了。他和青年红旗队的队员们一商量，大家决定紧挨着风雨桥架一条水槽。去年春天，他们按照自己的计划动工了。动工时，有些有迷信思想的人说：“木槽淌水哗啦啦响，吵得桥上神公日夜不安，惹出了祸事怎么办？”队员听了个个不服，都说：这分明是好事，怎么会惹出灾祸？就这样，他们终于靠桥架起了木槽。这片田，过去最高亩产只有四百八十斤，去年早稻平均每亩收了一千多斤。在收割的季节，人们唱着：收割的日子笑盈盈，堆堆谷子撞着半天云，风雨桥、鼓楼都变仓库，也装不完这样多的金！
    无底洞上庆丰收
    凤朝村西南边“无底洞”上的晚稻，去年打了一万三千八百多斤，平均亩产达二千三百一十三斤九两，真是破天荒的大喜事！
    提起“无底洞”，说来话长。相传，这儿早先是高山深谷，遍地荆棘，勤劳的少数民族人民劈山填沟，把河谷变成了良田。多少年代以后的一天，一个农民在田里耙田，突然陷到烂泥里不见了。后来在五里地之外的“龙吸口”，才发现了他的尸体。从此，这块田常年冒水，冰凉彻骨，变成了可怕的陷井。一直到1957年，谁也摸不清田有多深，也不敢去耕种。人们说那里面有吃人的妖怪，取名叫“无底洞”。
    党关于破除迷信、发展生产的号召，激发了青年人敢想敢干的雄心。去年2月，有一群小伙子冒着严寒，到“无底洞”去探险了。他们扛着一块长木板，用绳拴住四个角，放在田里漂着。侯帮理、侯光宗坐在板上，拿着竹竿探试深浅，其他的人站在田边拉着绳子。侯帮理用力猛插第一竿，入泥四尺多深，以后，又达到了五尺，八尺，最深也不过一丈多。原来，无底洞还是有个底。怎样来改造呢？青年们商议着。他们想起党委曾经指示过：浅田变深田，深田也能变浅田。马上集合了六十多人，凿岩石，挑泥土，用“移山填海”的办法苦战五昼夜，把无底洞填得只有三尺多深。然后用红粘土掺石灰、粪肥打好了田底，并插上了秧。就这样，无底洞终于披上了青装。第一季亩产七百八十四斤，加上晚稻，这往年颗粒不收的六亩田，平均亩产三千多斤。在寨子里，“无底洞”吃人的神话，已经成为人们茶余饭后的笑谈。（附图片）
