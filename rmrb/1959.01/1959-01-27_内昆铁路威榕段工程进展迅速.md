Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 26th. The Weirong (Weining) Rong (Feng) section of the Neikun Railway is progressing rapidly. At present, the vast majority of manpower has been transferred to the main line construction. The 120-kilometer transportation line parallel to the railway from Jinzhong in Weining to Panlong in Rongfeng has been completed.

The Railway Corps unit undertaking this section of the project, together with the road-building workers, are working with soaring enthusiasm. In the first ten days of this year, the speed of tunneling was almost twice that of late December last year. At 8:00 PM on January 9th, the pilot tunnel of the Chege Tunnel, with a total length of 138 meters, was completed six days ahead of schedule. This is the first of the 72 tunnels in the Weirong section to be completed. In terms of bridge construction, the fastest is the Xincun Bridge. This bridge is 194 meters long, and three piers have now been completed.

During the construction, the Railway Corps and civilian workers also displayed their ingenuity, creating earth transportation tools and setting up some material manufacturing plants and mechanical repair shops, which have played a significant role in saving labor, improving work efficiency, and overcoming raw material difficulties.

    内昆铁路威榕段工程进展迅速
    新华社昆明26日电　内昆铁路威（宁）榕（峰）段工程迅速向前进展。目前，绝大部分人力已转入正线施工。从威宁的金钟到榕峰的盘龙段，同铁路平行的一百二十公里的运输线已经修通。
    担任这段工程的铁道兵某部同修路民工一道，在施工中以冲天的干劲，在今年的头十天里打洞的速度，几乎等于去年12月下旬的两倍。9日下午八时，全长一百三十八公尺的扯格隧道导坑提前六天打通了，这是威榕段七十二座隧道中最先打通的一座。在桥梁施工方面，最快的是新村大桥，这座桥长一百九十四公尺，现在已经完成了三个桥墩台。
    在施工中，铁道兵和民工还发挥巧干的精神，创造了土运输工具并且办起了一些材料制造厂和机械修理厂，对于节省劳力、提高工作效率和克服原材料困难，都起了很大作用。
