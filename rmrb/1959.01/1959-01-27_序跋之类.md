    Prefaces and Postscripts
    Qin Li

    Before reading a book, people are always accustomed to looking at the preface and postscript first, because this can enhance our understanding of the book's content. However, some time ago, this request was often difficult to fulfill. This shows that in addition to some authors not caring about prefaces and postscripts, publishing houses have also abandoned this good platform for educating readers.

    However, some people are happy to take the opportunity to make a big fuss. For example, the author of "Old News of National History," published in July last year, openly promoted feudal ideology in the book's "Self-Preface." He praised his landlord and merchant ancestors for "being diligent and thrifty in farming, and also engaging in trade to exchange what they had for what they lacked," regarded the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution as "military disasters," and regretted that the Qing Dynasty had not been able to suppress it in time, causing his great-grandfather to die young and his family to decline!

    This kind of phenomenon has changed somewhat now. There are more prefaces, postscripts, and annotations in our publications, and there are more articles discussing issues from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. For example, "Newly Compiled Three Hundred Tang Poems" published by Zhonghua Book Company and "Selected Poems and Essays of Kang Youwei" published by People's Literature Publishing House are examples of efforts in this direction.

    "Selected Poems and Essays of Kang Youwei" has a rather long preface, which, in addition to introducing the progressive role of his reformist ideology under the historical conditions at the time, also criticized the reactionary side of his reformist ideology. An analysis was also made of his poems and essays. The attached chronology at the end of the book describes in an original way Kang Youwei's life from being a protagonist of the Hundred Days' Reform to degenerating into a reactionary monarchist and restorationist. The style is also not like the old-fashioned chronology, which is simply a record of objective facts; it often includes criticism at important key points, focusing on the scope related to ideological development and political activities. These have aroused the readers' interest.

    The editors' labor of breaking down and building up is quite arduous, but it is very meaningful work. We thank and welcome this new attempt and effort.

    序跋之类
    秦犁
    读书之前，人们总是习惯先把一本书的序跋看一下，因为这样可以增进我们对于书的内容的理解。但是在前些时候，这种要求也会难以如愿。这说明除了有些作者对序跋之类不介意以外，出版社也放弃了这个向读者进行教育的好地盘。
    但是也有人乐于借此大肆发挥，如去年7月出版的“国史旧闻”的作者就在这书的“自序”里公开宣扬起封建思想来了，他称颂地主兼商人的祖先为“躬勤俭以力稼，兼懋迁于有无”，把太平天国革命看成是“兵燹”，恨清朝没能及时镇压下去，致使他曾祖早年丧命，家道中衰！
    这类现象现在已经有所改变了，我们的出版物中序跋注释之类已经多了，运用马克思列宁主义的观点来谈问题的也多了。如中华书局出版的“新编唐诗三百首”、人民文学出版社出版的“康有为诗文选”就是朝着这个方向努力的一个例子。
    “康有为诗文选”里有篇不短的前言，除了介绍了他的改良主义思想在当时历史条件下的进步作用以外，也批判了他改良主义思想本质的反动的一面。对于他的诗文也进行了分析。书后附录的年谱也别出心裁地叙述了康有为由一个戊戌政变的主角堕落为反动的保皇主义者和复辟主义者的一生经过。体例也不像旧式年谱一样的只是客观事实的简单记录，它在重要关键处常常有所批判，着重了与思想发展、政治活动有关的范围。这些都引起了读者的兴趣。
    编选者这种有破有立的劳动是相当辛苦的，但这是很有意义的工作。我们感谢和欢迎这种新的尝试和努力。
