Night Visit to Qingtong Gorge

The Qingtong Gorge Water Conservancy Hub construction site on the Yellow River is brightly lit on this winter night, resembling daytime. Countless lights reflect the rushing Yellow River, where enormous ice floes cascade down like piles of snow. Both banks of the Yellow River present a scene of bustling activity. The sounds of bulldozers, winches, and diesel engines echo through the canyon. Excavation of the dam foundation, water pumping, and concrete pouring are underway simultaneously on several fronts, progressing in an interwoven manner. Nearly ten thousand Hui and Han workers have been fighting here day and night for three full months. Using ancient folk methods, they have swiftly built a "grass-and-earth cofferdam" stretching over six hundred meters. Like iron arms, it tightly embraces half of the Yellow River's valley.

The project entered a more arduous and demanding new phase in mid-December 1958. Everyone at the construction site is fighting intensely for the goal of cutting off the river in April and releasing water by May 1st. They put forward a resounding slogan: "Every second counts, everyone is responsible."

Late at night, the temperature at the Qingtong Gorge construction site drops to around minus ten degrees Celsius, but the bitter cold cannot deter the determination of the heroes. As the foundation pit is excavated to a certain depth, a large amount of water continuously seeps in, becoming a formidable enemy in the construction process. Drainage has become the most urgent task. Leading comrades from the Party committee and the Engineering Bureau take turns on night shifts, sticking to their posts and personally supervising the battle. Those responsible for drainage are fighting the infiltrating water every second, striving to stay ahead of the water. Veteran technicians Chang Baoxing, Wang Xianzhang, and Sun Dewang, in order to repair a 20-horsepower diesel engine, stood in the water, operating persistently in the biting wind. The water submerged their knees, filling their rubber boots. The water splashed on their bodies immediately froze into a layer of ice, but sweat dripped from everyone's foreheads. The machine wasn't repaired yet, and watching the seepage rise one centimeter at a time, the water was about to flood the excavator's seat. This was a crucial moment where every second counted. At this moment, someone shouted, "Quick, transfer the nearby diesel engine to relieve the dangerous situation here!" "Right!" With a resounding echo, they and a dozen workers carried a running diesel engine from a hundred meters away. By the time the newly moved machine was installed, it was already past four in the morning. The leading comrades wanted them to rest for a while, but they said in unison, "How can we sleep when the machine hasn't been repaired yet?" and proceeded to repair the broken machine.

"Comrades, work harder! If we don't speed up the excavation of the dam foundation, it will affect the concrete pouring!" A loud voice came from a nearby construction site. Hundreds of workers wearing leather vests responded in chorus: "Work harder!" The sound drowned out the noise of the nearby diesel engines. They had to remove a layer of topsoil eight to fourteen meters thick and peel off two to three meters of rock. A lively competition unfolded on the construction site. They said, "We are building a power station in our hometown. How can we be worthy of the Party if we don't work harder!" The forty-three members of the Lingwu Militia Battalion Youth Shock Brigade are already well-known night-fighting experts. For over two months, they have been working the night shift. They made a request to the Party organization at the construction site, saying, "Give us the most difficult work!" That night, while excavating the dam foundation, the deeper they dug, the more water seeped in. The water pumps were insufficient, and the water couldn't be drained in time, causing great difficulty for the excavation work. What to do? If they didn't dig, it would affect the continued pouring of concrete. Wu Shengqiang and Yang Wenhuan jumped into the water to excavate. Water filled their high rubber boots, and they worked in the water for a full eight hours. The captain asked them to come up and drink some wine, but they replied, "As long as we complete the task, a little cold doesn't matter!" No wonder they sang such heroic verses:

青铜峡的英雄兵，　　　　　　　　　　＊
满腔热血在沸腾，
寒风吹来黄河冻，
地冻天寒心不冷。

    ＊
The heroic soldiers of Qingtong Gorge,
Their hearts are filled with boiling blood,
The cold wind blows and the Yellow River freezes,
The ground is frozen and the sky is cold, but their hearts are not cold.
This is the heroic character of the builders of Qingtong Gorge.

The dam pouring project is also underway intensely. The warm shed is as warm as spring, and more than a dozen electric lights illuminate it like daytime. At this moment, the raging northwest wind makes the high-voltage lines hum, and the yellow sand obscures the sky, but the workers have become even stronger. In order to overcome the cold, they rush from the concrete mixing plant, more than three hundred meters away, pushing the concrete in wheelbarrows. In an instant, the concrete spills from the funnel onto the rocks. The vibrator operators from Sanmenxia start the vibrators, evenly distributing the cement and gravel. They are worthy of pride. Their footprints have been imprinted on many large reservoir construction sites throughout the country, and now they have reappeared on the Qingtong Gorge construction site. They once said heroically, "We will safeguard the Yellow River and converge at the Three Gorges!" On the west bank of the Yellow River, leading comrades from the Party and government of the Second Engineering Area are inspecting the preparatory work for dam pouring. Pouring will also begin here, advancing side by side with the pouring project on the east bank of the river. The future dam will fly across here, cutting off the turbulent Yellow River. Half of the warm shed on the west bank has been built, and a light railway track, eight hundred meters long, transporting concrete, goes straight to the dam foundation. On the construction site, we can't see the faces of the heroes clearly, but from their accents, we can hear that some of them are locals, some are from Shanghai, Shandong, and Henan. They are all fighting for an ideal: that in one year, a dam will stand in the center of the Yellow River, generating 260,000 kilowatts of electricity every day, keeping the factory machines running day and night. The river water spraying from the gate will flow smoothly through the channels to the vast fields. The reservoir, with a capacity of 900 million cubic meters, will be the largest lake in the autonomous region and a breeding ground for fish. Around it, there will be lush trees and scattered buildings. At that time, people will come here to recuperate and spend pleasant holidays.

    夜访青铜峡
    冬夜，黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程的工地上灯光闪闪，整个工地如同白天一样。盏盏灯火映照着湍急的黄河水，巨大的冰凌像雪堆似地一泻千里。黄河两岸呈现着一片繁忙的景象，推土机、卷扬机、柴油机的声音响彻峡谷。修筑拦河大坝的坝基开挖、抽水、混凝土浇筑几条战线同时铺开，交错进展。近万名回族和汉族民工，已经不分昼夜地在这里战斗了整整三个月。他们用民间古老的办法，神速地筑起了共长六百多公尺的“草土围堰”。它像铁臂似的，紧紧地环抱着黄河半个河谷。
    工程自1958年12月中旬进入了一个更加艰巨和繁重的新阶段。全工地的人都在为今年4月截流，“五一”放水紧张地战斗着。他们提出响亮的口号：“分秒必争，人人有责”。
    深夜，青铜峡工地的气温下降到摄氏零下十度左右，但严寒阻拦不住英雄的决心。在基坑开挖到一定的深度时，大量的水不断渗透进来，这是施工过程中的劲敌。排水成了当前最紧迫的任务。党委和工程局领导同志晚上轮流值班，坚守阵地，亲自督战。排水的人们每分每秒都在和渗透的水搏斗着，争取跑在水的前面。老技工常保兴、王宪章、孙德旺为了修理好一架二十马力的柴油机，在大风刺骨的夜里，站在水中坚持操作。水没过了膝盖，灌满了胶皮高靴；溅在身上的水，立即冻结成一层冰，但他们每个人的头上却冒着汗珠。机器还没有修好，眼看着渗水一公分、一公分地往上冒，马上水就要漫过挖土机的坐垫了，这正是分秒必争的关头。这时不知谁喊了一句：“快把附近的柴油机调来解救这里的险局！”“对！”一声响，他们和十几个民工，从一百公尺以外的地方把一台正在运转的柴油机扛过来。这时，水泵被水淹没了，也来不及考虑，他们又跳下水去搬动水泵位置。当装好新搬来的机器时，已是深夜四点多了。领导同志要他们歇一会儿，可是他们异口同声地说：“机器还没有修好，怎么能入睡呢？”又动手修理那台坏了的机器。
    “同志们，加油干，咱们不加快开挖坝基，就会影响混凝土浇灌”，从附近工地上传来了宏亮的声音。成百个穿着皮背心的民工应和着：“加油干啊！”声音压倒了近处的柴油机声。他们要掀掉八至十四公尺厚的一层地皮，剥开二至三公尺厚的岩石。工地上展开了热火朝天的竞赛，他们说：“在咱们家乡修电站，再不加油干，怎么对得起党！”灵武民兵营青年突击队四十三个队员已经是出名的夜战突击手。二个多月来，他们一直干夜班，他们向工地党组织提出要求说：“把最困难的工作交给我们！”这一夜，在开挖坝基时，愈挖到深处，渗水愈多，抽水机不够用，水不能及时抽干，给开挖工作带来极大困难。怎么办？不挖，就要影响继续浇筑混凝土。吴生强、杨文焕就跳到水里开挖，水灌满了长统胶鞋，在水中整整干了八个小时。队长要他们上来喝点酒，他们却回答：“只要完成任务，冻点也没有什么！”难怪他们唱出了这样豪迈的诗句：　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　＊
        青铜峡的英雄兵，　　　　　　　　　　＊
        满腔热血在沸腾，
        寒风吹来黄河冻，
        地冻天寒心不冷。这就是青铜峡建设者们的英雄本色。
    大坝浇灌工程也正在紧张进行。暖棚里温暖如春，十几盏电灯照耀得如同白天。此刻，狂暴的西北风，吹得高压线呼呼作响，黄沙遮天，但是民工们却变得更加坚强。他们为了战胜寒冷，飞也似的从三百多公尺远的混凝土拌合厂里，用小车把混凝土推来，倾刻之间，混凝土从漏管中吐泻到岩石上。来自三门峡的振捣手开动振捣器，均匀洋灰和沙石。他们是值得自豪的，在祖国许多大水库工地，都曾经印过他们的足迹，如今却又出现在青铜峡工地上。他们曾经豪迈地说过：“保打黄河，会师三峡！”在黄河西岸，二工区党政领导同志，在检查大坝浇筑准备工作。这里，也将开始浇筑，和河东浇筑工程并头前进。未来的大坝将在这里飞架而过，斩断汹涌的黄河水。河西的暖棚已盖好一半，一条运送混凝土的长达八百公尺的轻便铁轨直奔坝基。在工地上，我们看不清英雄的脸庞，但从他们的口音上，可以听得出，他们中间，有的是本地人，有的是上海人、山东人、河南人。他们都在为一个理想而战斗着，这就是：一年之后，这里一座大坝耸立在黄河中央，每天发出二十六万瓩的电量，使工厂的机器日夜转动。从闸门喷出的河水，顺着渠道畅流到广阔的田园。容量达九亿立方的水库，将是自治区最大的湖泊，也是鱼群繁殖的场所。在它周围，绿树成荫，楼房星落。那时，人们将在这里疗养，度过愉快的假日。
