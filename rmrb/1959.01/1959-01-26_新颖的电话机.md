Novel Telephones

    Unable to relay messages when no one is home
    Have you seen a telephone like this? When you're not at home, if someone calls for you, it will respond audibly: "This is a recording telephone. The owner is not at home. Please leave a message, and I will tell him when he returns." Then it will record everything the caller says. When you return, you can turn on the recorder, pick up the receiver, and find out who called and what they said.
    This type of recording telephone has been successfully trial-produced by Kang Taizhong and others at the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications.

    One Machine, Five Uses
    Zhu Bingqi, a young technician at the Mechanical Power Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, and the workers have jointly researched and successfully trial-produced a five-use telephone.
    In addition to making and receiving calls, this telephone can also be used as a radio, a broadcasting machine, a sound amplifier for telephone conferences, and a record player.
    This telephone was mostly made from waste materials and cost only a little over sixty yuan.

    ·Only the Size of a Soap Box·
    Employees of the Baoshan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Jiangsu Province recently made a miniature telephone. It is about the size of a soap box and has a very simple structure. On the outside of the plastic box, there are two symmetrically arranged buttons, a signal light, and a transmitter. The telephone has two "antennae" and a "tail," with the earpiece inside the tail. The box contains an output transformer and four small dry-cell batteries. Just use a small bamboo pole to hang the two copper wire antennae on the telephone line, press a button, and wait for the signal light to turn on, then you can talk.

    The Deaf Can Also Hear
    Huang Haigen, a technical worker at the Shanghai Deaf-Aid Factory, has recently successfully trial-produced a telephone radio specially for the deaf. In addition to making calls, it can also be used to listen to the radio. Even deaf people with completely impaired auditory nerves can use it by placing the neuro-auditory device on their teeth or head.
    This telephone radio was introduced to seven deaf patients by the Shanghai branch of the China Welfare Association for the Deaf and Mute for trial listening, and the results were good. (Attached picture)

    新颖的电话机
    家中无人能传话
    你见过这样的电话机吗？当你不在家的时候，如果有人打电话找你，它便会发音接应：“我是录音电话机，主人不在家，你有事请讲吧，等他回来我转告他。”接着它便会把对方讲的话全部录下音来。等你回来扭开录音机拿起话机听筒，就可以知道谁来过电话，对方讲些什么话。
    这种录音电话机，已经由北京邮电学院康泰忠等试制成功。
    一机五用
    太原钢铁公司机械动力处青年技术员朱炳弃，和工人们一起研究试制成功一部五用电话机。
    这部电话机除了接打电话外，还可以用来作收音机、广播机、电话会议用的扩音机和放唱片。
    这部电话机大部分是用废料做的，一共只花了六十多元。
    ·只有皂盒大·
    江苏宝山县邮电局职工，最近制成一部袖珍话机。它的大小和肥皂盒差不多，构造也很简单。塑料盒外面对称地排着两个电钮，一个信号灯和一个发话机。话机有两个触角和一条尾巴，尾巴里装着耳听机，盒子里面装有一个输出变压器和四个小干电池。只要用一根小竹竿把两根铜丝触角挂上电话线，揿一下电钮，等信号灯亮了，就可以通话。
    聋人也能听
    上海耳聋机厂技术工人黄海根，最近试制成功一种专供聋人使用的电话收音机，除了打电话外，还可以用来收听广播，听觉神经全部残废的聋人也可以使用，只要把神经听觉器放在牙齿上或是头部就可以了。
    这种电话收音机经中国聋哑人福利会上海市分会介绍七个耳聋患者试听，效果良好。（附图片）
