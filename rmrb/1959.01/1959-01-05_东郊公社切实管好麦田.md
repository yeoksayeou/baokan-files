Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th January: Cadres and members of the Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng, Shandong, enthusiastically responded to the Ten Initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. They believe that the Ten Initiatives fully expressed their demands and what they wanted to do, making the direction of production development clearer and giving them more confidence.

The Dongjiao Commune is currently carrying out winter management of wheat fields. Li Kuichen, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of the Zhuxing Brigade, said that conscientiously doing a good job in wheat field management and earnestly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" is the key to achieving a greater harvest in 1959. In order to ensure that the wheat is well-fed and watered, this brigade is determined to apply fertilizer three to five times and irrigate five to seven times to the wheat fields. After reading the initiatives, Wei Chengen, captain of the Daxin Brigade, plans to mobilize commune members to accumulate dry ash from now on, so that they can apply fertilizer when the wheat turns green in the spring. In accordance with the spirit of the initiatives, the Peiliang Brigade is reorganizing its labor force and arranging work. They plan to dig two large ponds and sink seven wells to ensure that 70% of the land has water; in addition to raising a large number of pigs to accumulate fertilizer, they will also organize a professional team of 100 people to specialize in fertilizer accumulation, in order to ensure that sufficient fertilizer is applied to the wheat; and they will also organize a professional team of 300 people to specialize in sideline production, in order to provide the country with more commodities and increase the income of the commune.

    东郊公社切实管好麦田
    据新华社济南4日电　山东历城东郊人民公社干部和社员热烈响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议。他们认为十大倡议完全说出了他们的要求和要做的事情，使发展生产的方向更加明确，心中更加有数。
    东郊公社当前正对麦田进行越冬管理。祝幸大队的党支部副书记李奎臣说，认真做好小麦田间管理和认真执行“八字宪法”是1959年获得更大丰收的关键。为了让小麦吃饱喝足，这个大队决心要给麦田追三至五次肥，浇五至七遍水。大辛大队队长魏承恩看了倡议以后，计划从现在起就发动社员积干灰，等开春小麦返青时好追肥。裴梁大队根据倡议精神，正重新组织劳力，安排活路。他们计划挖两个大塘，打七眼水井，保证70％的土地要水有水；除大量养猪积肥外，再组织一百人的专业队专门积肥，以保证给小麦追施足够的肥料；还要组织三百人的专业队专搞副业生产，以便为国家提供更多的商品，增加公社的收入。
