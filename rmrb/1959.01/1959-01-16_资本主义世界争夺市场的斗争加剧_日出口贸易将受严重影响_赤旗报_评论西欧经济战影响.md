Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th. "Akahata" published an article on the 14th pointing out that the implementation of free currency convertibility by Western European countries and the establishment of the "Common Market" by the six Western European countries will hit the Japanese monopoly capital groups' plans to ease the economic crisis through expanding exports. The article pointed out that these measures by Western European countries will further intensify competition in the international capitalist market, and will become a major obstacle to Japan's trade, which is already hitting snags everywhere in its "economic diplomacy." Especially in terms of exports, Japan cannot compete with the cheap exports of Western European countries and will suffer heavy blows in important markets.

The article pointed out that, as a result, the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital groups are being forced to re-examine the foreign exchange and trade management systems. Faced with this situation, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is already dejected.

The article pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is currently intensifying its efforts to strengthen its economic power internally by adopting methods of using financial funds and exploiting workers; externally, while conducting negotiations to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," it is attempting to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation" relationship, attempting to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" with the help of the power of the dollar.

According to recent news, Japan is deeply disturbed by the emergence of the Western European "Common Market," fearing that the agreements reached by Western European countries on tariffs and trade will cause difficulties for Japan's export trade to the Western European region, while goods from Western European countries will more easily enter the Asian region.

    资本主义世界争夺市场的斗争加剧
    日出口贸易将受严重影响
    “赤旗报”评论西欧经济战影响
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”14日发表文章指出，由于西欧国家实行货币自由兑换和西欧六国成立
  “共同市场”，将使日本垄断资本集团通过扩大输出来缓和经济危机的计划受到打击。文章指出，西欧各国的这些措施将更加加剧资本主义国际市场的竞争，并且对于“经济外交”已经到处碰壁的日本的贸易，将成为很大的障碍，尤其是在输出方面，日本不能对抗西欧各国商品的廉价输出，它将在重要市场上遭受沉重打击。
    文章指出，因此，目前岸信介政府和垄断资本集团被迫就外汇和贸易管理制度重新进行商讨。面临这种情况，通商产业省已经神气沮丧。
    文章指出，目前岸信介政府对内在加紧采取利用财政资金和剥削工人的办法来加强经济实力；对外，在进行修改日美“安全条约”谈判的同时，正在企图进一步加强日美“经济合作”关系，企图借助美元的力量来重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。
    据不久前的消息透露，日本对西欧“共同市场”的出现深感不安，它怕西欧国家在关税和贸易方面达成的协议，使日本对西欧地区的出口贸易发生困难，同时西欧国家的商品将更容易打入亚洲地区。
