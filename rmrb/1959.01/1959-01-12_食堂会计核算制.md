    Mess Hall Accounting System

    (By our newspaper) The Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, has established a "mess hall accounting system" during its rectification, strengthening the planned management of public mess halls.

    First, mess hall accounting is separated from production, administration, and other accounting, and calculated separately. Then, the commune determines the scope of mess hall expenses, accurately determining the per capita monthly consumption standards for grain, vegetables, fuel, seasonings, etc., and allocates them monthly based on vouchers. The mess hall then lists a material consumption statistics table based on income and expenditure, specifying the daily consumption of staple food, non-staple food, and cash. In this way, managers and the masses can calculate the per capita daily food standard at any time, thereby using the most economical method to save food and run the mess hall well.

    Since the implementation of the "accounting system" a month ago, it has shown three major benefits: First, with this simple accounting method, each meal uses grain and money according to plan. Second, the mess hall can keep accounts clear monthly and settled daily, and regularly announce them to the commune members, truly placing the mess hall management under the supervision of the masses. Third, everything is planned, and the work is not chaotic.

    食堂会计核算制
    本报讯　四川省郫县红光人民公社在整社中，建立了“食堂会计核算制”，加强了公共食堂的计划管理。
    首先是把食堂会计和生产、行政等会计分开，单独计算。接着，由公社确定食堂的开支范围，精确定出每人每月粮食、蔬菜、燃料、调味等消费标准，按月凭据调拨。食堂再根据收入和支出，列成物资耗用统计表，分项填明每天主食、副食等消费数量和现金。这样，管理员和群众在任何时候都能算出每人每天的伙食标准，从而用最经济的办法，节约粮食，办好食堂。
    实行“会计核算制”一月来，已显示出三大好处：第一，有了这个简易的会计核算办法，每顿饭都按计划用粮、用钱。第二，食堂可以作到账目月清日结，定期向社员公布，把食堂管理真正置于群众的监督之下。第三，事事有计划，工作不紊乱。
