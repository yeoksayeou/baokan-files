名词解释 [Noun Explanation]

Lunar Dust

The rapid drop in temperature on the moon's surface observed during lunar eclipses (a change of 250℃ in two hours) indicates that the thermal conductivity of the lunar surface is very low, a condition that could only exist if the lunar surface were covered with a layer of dust-like material. As for where this layer of dust comes from, there are different hypotheses. Some believe it is due to the effects of the moon's huge temperature changes, while others believe it is the result of falling cosmic dust and explosions caused by falling meteorites. The exact cause remains to be studied further.

    月球上的尘土
    从月食时所观测到的月亮表面温度急剧下降的情形（两小时内变化250℃），可知月面的导热率非常小，而且有当月面上盖有一层灰尘状物质时才可能有这种情况。至于这层尘土是哪儿来的，有不同的假说，有的认为这是月亮上温度巨大变化的影响所致，有的认为这是宇宙尘的落下和陨石落下时所产生的爆裂的结果，究竟是什么原因，有待于继续研究。
