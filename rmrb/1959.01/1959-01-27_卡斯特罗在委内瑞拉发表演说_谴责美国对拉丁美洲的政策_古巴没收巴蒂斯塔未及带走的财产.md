During his visit to Venezuela, Castro participated in several rallies held by people from all walks of life in Caracas to welcome him. Reports say that at a mass rally on the 25th, Castro reiterated the importance of "unity and cooperation among Latin American democratic countries." Castro also expressed his support for the establishment of a common market in Latin America and condemned the US policy towards Latin America. Castro said that the United States "cannot always defend the interests of monopoly capital." He said, "The United States must at least respect the right of each country to establish its own government."

Prior to this, Castro spoke to a rally of 10,000 people, mostly students. Reports say that in this speech, Castro condemned the dictators of Dominica and Paraguay. He also accused the United States of "supporting" these "Latin American dictators."

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th, Havana Dispatch: During Batista's rule, this dictator amassed a large amount of money through embezzlement. According to an announcement by the Cuban provisional government on the 24th, so far, 25 million US dollars of "property" under the name of dictator Batista has been identified. The government has decided to confiscate this embezzled money and put it into the national treasury.

According to reports, when the Cuban provisional government was investigating the large amount of wealth that Batista did not have time to take away, they discovered a will personally written by the dictator on January 17, 1957. This will stipulated that 2.26 million in cash and 3.74 million in securities would be left to his son. Prior to this, the Cuban provisional government also discovered a sum of money deposited in the bank under the name of Batista's former presidential secretary, Domingo. This money was also prepared for his son, including 6 million in securities and millions in cash and stocks. The investigation also revealed stocks and cash worth 4 million US dollars deposited in the name of Batista's wife.
