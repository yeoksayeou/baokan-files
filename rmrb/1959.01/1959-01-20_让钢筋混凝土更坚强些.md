    Make Reinforced Concrete Stronger
    Mou Zhi
    In this year's various capital construction projects, we will vigorously promote prestressed concrete structures. Prestressed concrete is one of the world's advanced structural technologies. In bridges, roof trusses, bicycle beams, aircraft hangars, water pipes, pavements, water towers, granaries... and other aspects, it can achieve the purpose of saving materials and reducing self-weight. Compared with steel structures, it can save 60%-70% of steel. Compared with ordinary reinforced concrete structures, it not only has better quality, but also saves steel and cement, and reduces the weight of the structure itself.
    What is prestressing?
    If a row of upright books is squeezed tightly at both ends by hand, not only will it not be easy to pull them out, but also this row of books will be like a strong horizontal beam. Even if some heavy objects are placed on it, the books will not fall. This is because stress is pre-added to the row of books, which is called prestressing.
    Prestressed reinforced concrete is to pre-add stress to the reinforced concrete structure. Take a reinforced concrete beam as an example. When weight is added to it, it will bend downward. When the beam bends, the bottom of the beam will lengthen, which means that tensile stress is occurring; the upper part of the beam will shorten, which means that compressive stress is occurring. Because concrete can resist compression but its tensile performance is very poor, steel bars with good tensile resistance are used to help at the bottom of the beam. They cooperate with each other. This is ordinary reinforced concrete. In an ordinary reinforced concrete beam, there is no other stress except for the stress caused by its own weight before being subjected to load. If pressure is applied to the steel bars first, wouldn't that exactly offset the tensile force that occurs when subjected to load? Yes, that's a great idea! Before pouring a reinforced concrete beam, the steel bars are first tensioned, and after the concrete is poured and hardened, the steel bars are released. At this time, the steel bars tightly want to stretch back, but the hardened concrete stubbornly holds them back. This means that pressure has already occurred in the steel bars. Due to the effect of the bottom steel bars shrinking, the upper concrete has a tendency to be pulled apart, which means that tensile force has occurred. These pre-added stresses in the reinforced concrete beam are exactly the opposite of the stresses that occur after loading, so they can also offset a portion. Therefore, prestressed concrete can carry more load than ordinary reinforced concrete.

    让钢筋混凝土更坚强些
    谋之
    在今年的各项基本建设中，我们将大力推广预应力混凝土结构。预应力混凝土是世界上先进的结构技术之一。在桥梁、屋架、自行车梁、飞机库、水管、路面、水塔、谷仓……等各方面，都能够达到节省材料减少自重的目的。和钢结构相比，可以节省钢材60％—70％，和普通钢筋混凝土结构相比，不仅质量比较好，而且也节省了钢材水泥，减轻了结构本身的重量。
    什么叫预应力呢？
    一横列立着的书本，如果用手在两端挤紧，不但不容易抽出来，而且这横列的书会像一根坚强的横梁一样，即使在上面放上些重物，书本也不会跌落下来。这是因为在一横列书里，预先加上了应力，这就叫做预应力。
    预应力钢筋混凝土，也就是在钢筋混凝土结构里预先加上了应力。拿一根钢筋混凝土梁来说吧，当它上面加上重量的时候，它就会向下弯曲。当梁弯曲的时候，梁的底部就要拉长，这说明发生着拉应力；梁的上部就要压短，这说明发生着压应力。因为混凝土能够抗压而抗拉的性能很差，因此在梁的底部就请抗拉很好的钢筋来帮助，它们分工协作，这就是普通的钢筋混凝土。在普通的钢筋混凝土梁里，没有受到载重以前，除了由于本身重量而发生的应力而外，是没有什么其他应力的。如果在钢筋里先加上压力，那末受到载重而发生拉力的时候，不正好抵消吗？对，这真是好主意！在钢筋混凝土梁浇捣以前，先把钢筋拉紧，把混凝土浇捣并且结硬以后再将钢筋放松，这个时候，钢筋紧紧的要伸张回去，已结硬的混凝土却苦苦的将它拖住。这也就是说，已经在钢筋里发生了压力。由于底部钢筋紧缩的影响，上部的混凝土却有着拉开去的趋势，这也就是发生了拉力。这些在钢筋混凝土梁里预先加上的应力，刚好和载重后发生的应力相反，这样也就能抵消一部分。因此预应力混凝土的载重比普通的钢筋混凝土更多。
