With thousands of carrying poles and ten thousand baskets, we shoulder the high mountains and steep ridges.
With a thousand iron shovels and ten thousand picks, we work together to build a road to happiness.
With a thousand red flags and ten thousand hearts, red flags and red hearts face Xining.

    齐心修条幸福路
    奔卉千条扁担万个篮，来把高山峻岭担。千把铁铣万把镐，齐心修条幸福道。千面红旗万颗心，红旗红心向西宁。
