    Three "Children's Manure Piles"
    On January 16th, I, along with Qiu Guocai, the Party Secretary of Hongtang Commune, went to the Yitang production team to understand the situation of manure accumulation. On the way, we met Liu Fucai, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee, who joined us as we walked towards the fields. When passing Dongmen Kiln, Liu Fucai pointed with a smile to three small manure piles by the roadside and told us, "These are three children's manure piles." Then he told us a story about several children accumulating manure.
    Some time ago, the commune called on its members to vigorously engage in the manure accumulation movement. Four children, all under the age of ten, excitedly came to ask to participate in the manure accumulation work. Seeing that they were young and afraid they would get tired, I said to them, "You are still young now, wait until you grow up before contributing to the Great Leap Forward!" They said unhappily, "Socialism doesn't distinguish between age, adults do big things, children do small things. If we collect a few loads of fertilizer, we can also contribute a little to the Great Leap Forward!" After saying that, they ran off in a puff of smoke. After these children went back, they quietly started working, led by nine-year-old Peng Hannv. Because they were young and weak, they carried a basket together in pairs, sweeping fallen leaves everywhere. After sweeping the fallen leaves, they went to shovel sod. One shoveled, two carried, one piled, and they kept busy. In just a few days, they accumulated three manure piles, totaling more than four hundred loads. After they piled up the fertilizer, they specifically ran up to me and said, "Uncle Liu! You said we were too young to accumulate manure, now please go and see our manure piles!"...
    At this point in his story, Liu Fucai asked us to look at the bamboo sticks stuck in the manure piles. We saw the words "Children's Manure Pile" written crookedly on the sticks. (Zeng Shangde, Yichun, Jiangxi)

    三个“少儿肥堆”
    1月16日，我同洪塘公社党委书记丘国材，到伊塘作业区去了解积肥情况。路上遇见团委书记刘福才，他跟我们一道向田间走去。路过东门窑的时候，刘福才笑咪咪地指着路边三个小肥堆告诉我们说：“这是三个少儿肥堆。”接着他就向我们讲了一段几个小孩积肥的故事。
    在前些时候，公社号召社员大搞积肥运动，有四个不满十岁的小孩，兴致勃勃地跑来要求参加积肥工作。我见他们年纪小，怕累坏了，便对他们说：“你们现在年纪小，等以后长大了，再为大跃进出力吧！”他们很不高兴地说：“搞社会主义还分什么年纪大小，大人做大事，小孩做小事，我们搞几担肥料，也能为大跃进出一点力呀！”说完就一溜烟跑走了。这几个孩子回去后，就在九岁的彭汉女带领下，悄悄地干起来了。因为年纪小、力气弱，他们就两人抬一个箩筐，到处扫落叶。扫完落叶，又去铲草皮。一个铲，两个抬，一个堆，一直忙个不停。没有几天，就积了三个肥堆，足有四百多担。他们把肥料堆好后，特意跑到我跟前说：“刘叔叔！你说我们年纪小，不能积肥，现在请你去看看我们的肥堆吧！”……
    刘福才说到这儿，叫我们去看肥堆上插的竹签，只见竹签上歪歪斜斜的写着“少儿肥堆”几个字。　（江西宜春　曾尚德）
