    Do a good job of wheat field management and develop diversified operations
    Henan's People's Communes take measures to implement the spirit of the initiative
    According to the Henan Daily, the Ten Initiatives put forward by the National Advanced Units Representatives Conference on Agricultural Socialist Construction to the rural people's communes across the country have been warmly supported by the people's communes in Henan.
    43,676 members of the Weixing People's Commune, Yaoshan Management District, in Suiping County, held meetings to study and discuss the initiatives, expressing their determination to implement this program and strive for even greater victories in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1959.
    In order to carry out friendly competitions with peasant brothers throughout the province and respond to the Ten Initiatives, all commune members, after discussion, formulated conditions for the production increase competition.
    More than 2,000 representatives to the Yuxian County Industrial and Agricultural Labor Model Conference conducted serious study and discussion of the Ten Initiatives. During the discussion, Li Fasun, an agricultural labor model from Shundian Township, said that the Ten Initiatives are like bright lights, shining brightly in our hearts. In order to respond to the Ten Initiatives, I propose ten guarantees to the Party (guarantee to take steel as the key link to complete various tasks; guarantee to work in a down-to-earth manner and do a good job in wheat field management; guarantee to conduct large-scale high-yield experimental fields; guarantee to run canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly better; guarantee to follow the mass line; guarantee to organize production upsurges according to the Party's instructions; guarantee to strengthen political and cultural learning; guarantee to consolidate the people's communes; guarantee to complete production increase tasks according to the state plan; guarantee to always listen to the Party and lead the masses in production).
    The Hui County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Party Committee secretaries of each commune on the 4th of this month to specifically discuss the Ten Initiatives, unanimously expressing their determination to let the Ten Initiatives bloom and bear fruit universally in the people's communes of Hui County.
    In order to ensure that grain and cotton production double on the basis of last year, the meeting determined four measures: First, carry out a socialist and communist education movement of "thousands of people reporting and tens of thousands of people publicizing." Through publicity and education, the Ten Initiatives will be known to every household. Second, earnestly do a good job in all production. Third, develop diverse economies and expand commodity production. The county will draw 15,000 laborers to specialize in diverse economies, ensuring an income of 16.48 million yuan before the spring plowing. Fourth, closely integrate with production and do a good job in consolidating and rectifying the commune.
    The Zhongmu County Party Committee proposed that while vigorously publicizing the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes," it is necessary to publicize the requirements for responding to and realizing the Ten Initiatives. By the 15th, the content of the initiatives should be known to every household; each township, management district, and production team should formulate production plans in accordance with the spirit of this initiative. At the same time, the publicity for the resolution and initiatives should be used as a driving force to promote the current management of 680,000 mu of wheat fields in the county, and in the near future, fertilizer should be applied to the wheat everywhere, and water should be irrigated wherever possible.
    After the Yuanyang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically discussed the Ten Initiatives and initially proposed the main leap forward targets for industry, grain, cotton, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1959, it demanded that all localities vigorously launch in-depth publicity. After the people's communes launched publicity and study, the broad masses of commune members warmly responded to the Ten Initiatives, and production enthusiasm was even greater. The Shizhai People's Commune convened a meeting attended by 2,000 Party members, Youth League members, and activists, read out the Ten Initiatives, immediately formulated a plan, dispatched 10,000 people, and launched a major campaign to accumulate fertilizer and topdress the wheat fields, guaranteeing the accumulation of 600,000 carts of fertilizer within seven days and the application of fertilizer three times to all wheat fields.
