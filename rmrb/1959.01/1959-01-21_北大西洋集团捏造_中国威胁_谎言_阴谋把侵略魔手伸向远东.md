Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 20th: A communique issued on the 17th by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) headquarters reveals that the North Atlantic Group, manipulated by the United States, is again fabricating the lie of the so-called "threat from Communist China," plotting to use this as a pretext to extend its aggressive claws to the East.

The communique states that at the SEATO Representative Council meeting on the 15th, representatives from the United States, Britain, and France presented a communique from the North Atlantic Group Council, expressing "concern" about the so-called "growing threat from Communist China." The communique said that the North Atlantic Group has given "special attention to the efforts of the Communist bloc to weaken the position of the free world in various regions of the world."

U.S. Ambassador Johnson's speech at the Representative Council meeting showed that the United States is actively plotting to use the North Atlantic Group to intensify its aggression in the Far East. He said that the North Atlantic Group Council's clamoring about the so-called "growing threat from Communist China" is "very beneficial." He said that this shows that the military bloc named after the North Atlantic is not "too focused on Europe and is also focusing its attention on the Far East."

    北大西洋集团捏造“中国威胁”谎言
    阴谋把侵略魔手伸向远东
    新华社20日讯　曼谷消息：东南亚军事集团总部17日发表的一项公报透露，在美国操纵下的北大西洋集团，又在捏造所谓“共产党中国的威胁”的谎话，阴谋借此把它的侵略的魔手伸向东方。
    这项公报说，在东南亚条约集团代表理事会15日的会议上，美、英、法三国代表向会议提出了北大西洋集团理事会的一项公报，这项公报对所谓“共产党中国日益增长的威胁”表示“关切”。这项公报说，北大西洋集团对于所谓“共产党集团削弱自由世界在世界各个地区地位的努力已给予特别注意”。
    美国大使约翰逊在代表理事会会议上的发言，表明美国正积极策划利用北大西洋集团在远东加紧侵略活动。他说，北大西洋集团理事会叫嚷所谓“共产党中国日益增长的威胁”是“非常有益的”。他说，这表明，以北大西洋命名的军事集团不是“太专注于欧洲而且也正在把它的注意集中于远东。
