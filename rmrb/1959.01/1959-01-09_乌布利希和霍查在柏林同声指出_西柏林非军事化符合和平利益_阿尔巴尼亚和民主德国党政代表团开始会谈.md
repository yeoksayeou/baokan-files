Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 8th - The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, invited to visit the German Democratic Republic (GDR), arrived in Berlin on the 7th. The delegation of seven was led by Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Member of the Presidium of the People's Assembly. Members of the delegation included Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania; Manush Myftiu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Education and Culture; Koço Theodhosi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Behar Shtylla, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Kiço Ngjela, Minister of Trade; and Gjafer Pazi, Albanian Ambassador to the GDR. Kurt Prenzel, the GDR Ambassador to Albania, accompanied the delegation to Berlin.

When the Albanian Party and Government Delegation arrived in Berlin, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), and Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, spoke at the railway station.

In his speech, Ulbricht welcomed the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the government, and the people of the German Democratic Republic. Ulbricht praised the achievements of the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party. Referring to the great economic tasks facing the GDR, he pointed out that the most important thing for the successful execution of these tasks was to maintain peace. Ulbricht said that to maintain peace, it was necessary to solve two urgent tasks: the demilitarization and neutralization of West Berlin and the conclusion of a German peace treaty. He said that the Adenauer government opposed this, but Adenauer did not represent the whole of West Germany.

Ulbricht said that cooperation between the GDR and Albania was very important. He was convinced that this visit would contribute to the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to world peace.

In his speech, Hoxha said that there was a deep friendship between Albania and the German Democratic Republic. They are both an integral part of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. They stand at the forefront of the struggle against the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism. Hoxha said: "The German Democratic Republic is the first German state of workers and peasants, and it is a mirror of the future of the whole of Germany. The people from the Elbe and the Adriatic Sea to the Pacific Ocean have united as one. Any attack on the German Democratic Republic will be an attack on the entire socialist camp."

Hoxha said never to forget the danger of imperialist aggression. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting has turned West Germany into an aggressive military base, and the revival of German militarism in West Germany is particularly dangerous. Hoxha said: "We must further strengthen the Warsaw Pact as an instrument of peace and security in Europe. We must constantly strengthen our close friendship with our friend and defender, the Soviet Union, and we must know how to successfully defend the unity of our socialist camp against all conspiracies, provocations and attacks, whether these provocations and attacks are planned by the imperialists and their servants or by modern revisionists - mainly the Yugoslav revisionists."

Hoxha said that Albania supports the German Democratic Republic's proposals for the establishment of a confederation and the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and it supports the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a free, demilitarized city. He said that without a doubt, these measures would contribute to the cause of peace in Europe and the resolution of the German question.

Hoxha was convinced that the visit of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation to the GDR would strengthen relations between the two countries.

The Albanian Party and Government Delegation and the German Democratic Republic Delegation began talks on the afternoon of the 8th. The two sides reached a consensus on all issues. The talks will continue.

The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a grand banquet last night to welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation. At the banquet, General Stoph, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR, and Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, spoke successively.

In his speech, Stoph said that the balance of power in the world has undergone a decisive change in favor of peace and socialism, and the socialist world system headed by the Soviet Union is increasingly determining the development of the international situation. The Soviet space rocket, which is now orbiting the sun as the tenth planet, is a signal of the continuous progress of socialism.

Stoph said, "The time has come to eliminate the new hotbed of imperialist instigation of war in the heart of Germany." He said, "Eliminating the dangerous hotbed of West Berlin and turning this part of the capital of the German Democratic Republic into a demilitarized free city is not only in the interests of the German people, but also in the interests of all countries and peoples who advocate maintaining and defending peace."

In his speech, Hoxha said: "The existence of the first workers' and peasants' state in German history and its comprehensive development towards the socialist path is an event of great significance for the future of the German people and for peace in Europe." He said that Albania unreservedly supports the proposals for the establishment of a confederation between the German Democratic Republic and West Germany and the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and supports the Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a non-military free city. These proposals are the only policy that is fully in line with the vital interests of the German people and peace in Europe.

Before the banquet, President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic received Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania.

    乌布利希和霍查在柏林同声指出
    西柏林非军事化符合和平利益
    阿尔巴尼亚和民主德国党政代表团开始会谈
    据新华社柏林8日电　应邀访问民主德国的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团已于7日到达柏林。代表团一行七人，由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记、人民议会主席团委员霍查率领。团员有阿部长会议主席谢胡，党中央政治局委员、部长会议第一副主席兼教育和文化部部长穆夫蒂乌，中央政治局候补委员、部长会议副主席科·蒂奥多西，外交部部长贝·什图拉，贸易部部长基·恩杰拉，阿尔巴尼亚驻民主德国大使加·帕兹。陪同代表团前往柏林的有民主德国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使库尔特·普伦策尔。
    当阿尔巴尼亚党和政府代表团到柏林的时候，德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查在火车站上讲了话。
    乌布利希在讲话中代表德国统一社会党、德意志民主共和国政府和人民欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党和政府代表团。乌布利希赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下所取得的成就。他在谈到民主德国面临的伟大经济任务时指出，如果要顺利地执行这些任务，最重要的就是要维护和平。乌布利希说，要维护和平，就必须解决两项迫切的任务，即必须使西柏林非军事化和中立化，并且缔结对德和约。他说，阿登纳政府反对这样作，但是，阿登纳并不能代表整个西德。
    乌布利希说，民主德国同阿尔巴尼亚合作非常重要。他深信，这次访问将对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和世界和平作出贡献。
    霍查在讲话中说，阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国之间有着深厚的友谊。它们都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不可分割的一部分。它们在抗击以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力的斗争中站在最前列。霍查说：“德意志民主共和国是第一个工农德意志国家，它是整个德国前途的一面镜子。从易北河和亚德里亚海一直到太平洋之间的各国人民已经团结得像一个人一样。对德意志民主共和国的任何进攻都将是对整个社会主义阵营的进攻。”
    霍查说，决不要忘记帝国主义侵略的危险。北大西洋公约组织会议已经把西德变成一个侵略性的军事基地，德国军国主义在西德的复活是特别危险的。霍查说：“我们必须进一步加强作为欧洲和平与安全的工具的华沙条约，我们要经常加强同我们的朋友和保卫者苏联的密切友谊，而且我们一定要懂得如何成功地保卫我们社会主义阵营的团结，来对付一切阴谋挑衅和进攻，不管这种挑衅和进攻是帝国主义者和它们的仆从策划的也好，或者是现代修正主义者——主要是南斯拉夫式的修正主义者策划的也好。”
    霍查说，阿尔巴尼亚支持德意志民主共和国提出的建立邦联和缔结对德和约的建议，它并且支持苏联提出的把西柏林变成自由的、非军事化的城市的建议。他说，毫无疑问，这些措施将有助于欧洲的和平事业和德国问题的解决。
    霍查确信，阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的访问民主德国将加强两国之间的关系。
    阿尔巴尼亚党和政府代表团和德意志民主共和国代表团，8日下午开始举行会谈。双方在所有的问题上都达成一致的看法。会谈将继续进行。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会和德意志民主共和国部长会议昨晚举行盛大宴会，欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。在宴会席上，统一社会党中央政治局委员、民主德国副总理斯多夫上将和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查先后讲了话。
    斯多夫在讲话中说，世界上的力量对比已经朝着有利于和平和社会主义方面发生决定性的改变，以苏联为首的社会主义世界体系日益决定着国际局势的发展。现在作为第十个行星环绕太阳运行的苏联宇宙火箭就是社会主义不断前进的信号。
    斯多夫说，“现在已经是消除在德国心脏中帝国主义挑拨战争的新温床的时候了。”他说：“消除西柏林的危险温床，把德意志民主共和国首都的这一部分变成非军事化的自由城市，这不仅符合德国人民利益，而且符合所有主张维护和保卫和平的各国人民和各国的利益”。
    霍查在讲话中说：“德国人民历史上第一个工农国家的存在和它的向社会主义道路全面发展，是一个对于德国人民的未来和欧洲和平具有非常重大意义的事件。”他说，阿尔巴尼亚毫无保留地支持在民主德国和西德之间建立邦联的建议和缔结对德和约的建议，并且支持苏联政府关于把西柏林变为非军事的自由城市的建议，这些建议是完全符合德国人民和欧洲和平的切身利益的唯一政策。
    在宴会前，德意志民主共和国皮克总统接见了霍查和阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡。
