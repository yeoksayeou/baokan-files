　　I heard about a "new forty-year-old youth" in the Yangxi Branch Farm logging team before I even got to the mountain. After arriving at the team, I curiously asked the captain, Comrade Zhan Jinfu, about it. He chuckled a few times, and before he could say anything, a sturdy man with thick eyebrows, narrow eyes, and a square face walked in from outside. As soon as he took off his rattan safety helmet, Lao Zhan smiled and asked him, "How many did you cut today?" The man wiped his sweat with a towel and, seeing a stranger, said somewhat shyly, "Not many, only twenty-four." After he left, Lao Zhan told me that the man was called Wu Houchang, and he was the "new forty-year-old youth."
    In Lao Zhan's style of summing up work, he said in two sentences: "His enthusiasm for labor rivals that of a young man, and his eagerness to learn resembles that of a teenager." Take tree felling for example. The trees in this deep mountain are huge; it takes several people to encircle the thick ones. Being able to cut twenty-four trees a day is no easy feat, and he ranks among the top three out of twenty or thirty young men!
    I couldn't help but ask, "Then why do you call him a 'new youth'?" Lao Zhan said, "Don't rush, there's more to it."
    A wave of learning swept through the team. One day, everyone went to the forestry technician, Liu Jucheng, to register for newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Everyone was vying to subscribe to several publications. Wu Houchang, seeing the trend, also wanted to subscribe. Indeed, he couldn't understand the Forestry Journal, and he couldn't delve into nursery techniques. How could he manage without studying? The more he thought about it, the more he felt he needed to subscribe to a newspaper, but he only knew about two hundred characters. What should he subscribe to? Wu Houchang went to Zhan Jinfu and asked, "Captain Zhan, I can't understand the Jiangxi Daily, not to mention the People's Daily. I even stumble through the Jinggangshan Daily. What should I do?" Lao Zhan thought for a while and said, "Well, the 'New Youth Daily' is the simplest newspaper. It's for elementary school students in the third and fourth grades, and it has pictures and drawings." When Wu Houchang heard that it had pictures, he jumped up and ran to Liu Jucheng in two strides, excitedly saying, "I'll subscribe to the 'New Youth Daily'!" When Lao Liu heard this, he burst out laughing, but Captain Zhan stopped him with a glance before he could finish. From then on, news spread throughout the team: a forty-year-old man was subscribing to the "New Youth Daily."
    Once during a break, I wanted to chat with Lao Wu, but he was suddenly gone. After searching, I found him hiding in the bushes reading the newspaper. In his mind, his subscription to the "New Youth Daily" was in a "semi-secret state," but in reality, everyone knew about it, and the nickname had even spread down the mountain.

    四十岁的新少年
    朱惟豪
    我在山下就听说洋溪分场林业砍伐队有一位四十岁的新少年，我来到这个队之后，就好奇地问队长詹金发同志，他嘿嘿笑了几下，话还未出口，从外面走进一位横眉细眼，四方大脸的壮年人，他刚一取下藤壳安全帽，老詹就笑着问他：“你今天砍了多少啦？”那人用手巾拭了一下汗，见有生人，就不大好意思地说：“不多，只有二十四根。”他走后，老詹就告诉我，这人叫邬厚昌，就是那个“四十岁的新少年”。
    按照老詹那种善于总结工作的口气来说，两句话：“劳动劲头赛青年，虚心学习似少年”。就说砍树吧，这深山的树很大，粗的几个人才抱得住，一天能砍二十四根就不简单，他在二三十个小伙子里面还名列前三呢！
    我忍不住问：“那为什么叫他作‘新少年’呢？”老詹说：“别慌着，还有下文嘛。”
    队里掀起了学习高潮，有一天，大伙都到林业技术员刘居诚那里去登记订报刊，每人都争着订了好几份。邬厚昌看势头，也想订。可不是，他看林业通讯看不懂，苗圃技术也钻不进，不学习怎行呢？他越想越觉得要订份报纸看看，但他只识二百来字，订什么呢？邬厚昌找到詹金发，问：“詹队长，我江西日报看不懂，人民日报不消谈，井冈山报也结结巴巴，怎么办？”老詹想了一会，就说：“算‘新少年报’是最浅的报纸了。这是小学三、四年级的学生看的，里面还有图有画。”邬厚昌听说里面还有图，猛地跳起来，三步作两步跑到刘居诚那里，兴奋地说：“我订新少年报！”老刘听说就大笑起来，还未笑开，就被詹队长一个眼色给止住了。从此，这队里便传开了一件新闻——四十岁的人订“新少年报”。
    有一次休息，我想找老邬聊聊，他忽然不见了。一找，原来他躲在树丛里看报。在他看来，他订“新少年报”是处于“半秘密状态”，其实大家都知道了，外号还传到山下去了呢。
