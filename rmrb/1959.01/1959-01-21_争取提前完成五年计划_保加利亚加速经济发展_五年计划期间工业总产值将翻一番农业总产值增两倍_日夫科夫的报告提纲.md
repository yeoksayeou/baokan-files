Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 19th: Bulgarian newspapers today published the outline of the report to be given by Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, at the next session of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, on "Accelerating the Development of the National Economy, Raising the Material and Cultural Living Standards of the Working People, and Improving State and Economic Leadership." This report outline will be widely discussed throughout the nation.

In the outline, Zhivkov talked about the great achievements of the Bulgarian people in socialist construction and the brilliant and inspiring prospects for the development of the national economy in 1959-1962-1965.

Zhivkov said that the basis for the development of the national economy in 1959-1962-1965 will be: to rapidly increase agricultural production and the production of processing industries, while giving priority to increasing the production of means of production, and on this basis, greatly improve the people's living standards and welfare.

The outline stated that compared to 1957, the total industrial output value in 1962 will double, while previously it was only stipulated to increase by 62%. By 1965, industrial production will increase by two to three times compared to 1957. In 1965, approximately 700,000 tons of pig iron, approximately 900,000 tons of steel, and approximately 700,000 to 800,000 tons of steel products will be produced, meaning that steel product output will increase by approximately six times compared to 1957. In 1965, lead production will reach 90,000 tons, zinc production will reach 50,000 tons, and electrolytic copper production will reach approximately 25,000 tons.

In 1965, the scale of the machine-building and metal processing industry will increase by approximately five times compared to 1957, and coal production will increase by two to three times. Electricity generation in 1965 will reach approximately 10 billion kilowatt-hours.

The scale of the chemical industry in 1965 should increase by approximately six times compared to 1957. In 1965, Bulgaria should produce 30,000 to 40,000 tons of plastic products and over 1.6 million tons of chemical fertilizers, etc.

The outline stated that in agriculture, the total output value of agricultural products in 1962 will reach 40 billion to 45 billion leva. In 1965, the total output value of agricultural products will reach 60 billion leva, which is 45 billion leva more than what was produced in 1957. In 1965, 6.6 million tons of grain and green fodder will be produced.

The outline continued that, based on the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, by 1965, the national income will reach 100 billion to 110 billion leva, which is approximately 75% more than in 1957. Labor productivity will be greatly improved.

The rapid surge in the national economy will greatly increase people's consumption. By 1962, people's consumption will double compared to 1957 (the original plan was 40%), and by 1965, it will increase twofold.

The outline emphasized that solving these economic tasks will mean providing the material prerequisites for the gradual transition from socialism to communism throughout the country.

The outline stated: "A great historical turning point has taken place in agricultural development. The Party creatively applied Lenin's collectivization plan, ensuring the victory of socialism in the Bulgarian countryside." Currently, socialist agriculture has 680 large-scale agricultural production cooperatives, 54 state-owned farms, and 209 machine tractor stations.

The report outline stated that the cultural revolution is proceeding smoothly. Currently, approximately 1.3 million people in Bulgaria are studying in various types of schools. Twenty institutions of higher learning have been established, with over 40,000 students studying in them.

The outline emphasized the particularly important significance of the October and November plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party for further accelerating Bulgaria's socialist construction. The outline stated that the slogan put forward by the Party to strive to complete the Third Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) in three or four years has become a cause closely linked to the masses and a powerful material force, and has formed a nationwide movement. Some preliminary practical results of this nationwide movement prove that the enormous tasks put forward by the October and November plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to the Bulgarian people can be victoriously completed.

When discussing specific measures to improve state and economic leadership, the outline stated that it is now appropriate to take appropriate restrictions on the concentration of administrative management according to professional nature, and to establish approximately 30 administrative and economic regions based on regions to replace the existing 13 states (including cities equivalent to states) and 117 counties (including cities equivalent to counties). That is to say, various professional departments and competent authorities will delegate some of the powers of practical leadership over the national economy to local organizations – the state people's congresses. After the focus of national economic leadership shifts to the local level, it will bring the economic leadership organs closer to enterprises and production.

The outline pointed out that it is still necessary in the future to maintain centralized planning, centralized allocation of funds, and a centralized budget, and to be good at combining local management with centralized planning, centralized mobilization of funds, and centralized allocation of economic resources in important directions of economic development.

The outline pointed out that the basic economic production unit in the administrative and economic region in agriculture will be the agricultural production cooperative, the rural handicraft production cooperative, and a part of the existing local industrial enterprises will also be merged into this expanded agricultural production cooperative. The basic production unit in the administrative and economic region in industry is the industrial enterprise, which will be directly under the leadership of the administrative and economic region people's congress. In order to more fully utilize the full potential of industry, similar enterprises in republican industry and local industry must be merged.

The outline pointed out that in order to further improve the work of the Council of Ministers and better play the functions of the socialist state, some professional departments that still exist should be abolished, and the State Planning Commission, the Industrial and Technological Improvement Commission, the Construction and Building Commission, the Labor and Price Commission, the Health and Social Issues Commission, the National Inspection Commission, and the Central Bureau of Statistics should be established under the Council of Ministers.

The outline pays great attention to further consolidating and developing the agricultural cooperative system. The outline stated that Bulgaria has basically completed the process of expanding agricultural production cooperatives, which means the beginning of a new and higher stage in the development of the cooperative system in the Bulgarian countryside. Now, 680 large-scale agricultural cooperatives have been formed to replace the previous 3,450 agricultural cooperatives.

The outline pointed out that machine tractor stations have played a huge and positive role in consolidating Bulgaria's cooperative system and the victories it has achieved. The expansion of agricultural cooperatives raises the question of the suitability of starting to gradually reorganize machine tractor stations according to the example of the Soviet Union and selling tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machines directly to the cooperatives, so that by the time the five-year plan is completed, agricultural cooperatives in various administrative and economic regions in the country will be able to obtain the main part of the technical equipment of the machine tractor stations.

In the report outline, Zhivkov also talked about the issue of the gradual transition of Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. He said that in order to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, the following three profound transformations must be completed in agriculture: gradually raising the level of collective ownership of agricultural means of production to the level of ownership by the whole people; improving the provisions of the socialist principle of remuneration for agricultural labor, gradually reducing the differences in remuneration for the same quantity and quality of labor in various cooperatives, so as to achieve complete consistency in remuneration for labor between urban and rural areas in the future; because the labor of cooperative members gradually approaches the labor of industrial workers, the labor of members will become a form of industrialized labor.

In order to liberate the labor force of housewives, Zhivkov suggested taking the following measures: opening public canteens in various places; adding nurseries and kindergartens in urban and rural areas; opening new public laundries and bathhouses; greatly reducing the prices of children's clothing and shoes, and reducing the food expenses paid by parents with two or more children for their children in school canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens.

The outline pointed out that it is now necessary to abolish the state agricultural product mandatory purchase system and replace it with a new unified purchase system for agricultural products based on unified purchase prices, which can promote further rapid development of agriculture. Agriculture faces a huge task – to double agricultural production in two years.

The outline then pointed out that it is necessary to improve the labor remuneration system, increase the wages of low-wage laborers, and gradually transition to shortening the working day. It is necessary to rapidly develop public facilities in rural areas and expand the network of social service agencies and cultural institutions in rural areas in order to overcome the imbalance in cultural development between urban and rural areas.

The outline concluded that these measures are urgent and objectively necessary. They involve fundamental issues of national economic development, and they are determined by practical life, socialist practice, the internal development of Bulgaria's socialist economy, Bulgaria's internationalist obligations, and the need to expand Bulgaria's contribution to the overall competition between the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the imperialist camp. This program has historical significance for Bulgaria's further comprehensive development, for increasing Bulgaria's economic strength, and for greatly improving the material and cultural living standards of the Bulgarian people.

The outline emphasized: "The wise leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people's love of labor, and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are the guarantee of this victory."

    争取提前完成五年计划
    保加利亚加速经济发展
    五年计划期间工业总产值将翻一番农业总产值增两倍
    日夫科夫的报告提纲
    新华社索非亚19日电　保加利亚报纸今天发表了保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫将在保加利亚人民共和国国民议会下届会议上作的“加速国民经济的发展，提高劳动人民的物质生活和文化水平以及改进国家和经济领导”的报告提纲。这个报告提纲，将在全民中广泛展开讨论。
    日夫科夫在提纲中谈到了保加利亚人民在社会主义建设中的巨大成就和1959—1962—1965年发展国民经济的光辉的、令人鼓舞的前景。
    日夫科夫说，1959—1962—1965年国民经济发展的基础将是：在优先提高生产资料生产的情况下，迅速提高农业生产和加工工业部门的生产，并在这一基础上大大提高人民生活福利。
  提纲说，同1957年相比，1962年工业生产总产值将翻一番，而过去仅规定增加62％。到1965年，工业生产将比1957年增加二倍至三倍。1965年将生产约七十万吨生铁，约九十万吨钢，约七十至八十万吨钢材，也就是说，钢材产量要比1957年增加约六倍。1965年铅产量将达九万吨，锌产量达五万吨，电解铜的产量约二万五千吨。
    1965年，机器制造业和金属加工业的规模将比1957年增加约五倍，煤产量将增加二至三倍。1965年的发电量将达到约一百亿度。
    1965年化学工业的规模应比1957年增加约六倍。1965年保加利亚应生产三万吨至四万吨塑料制品和一百六十万吨以上的化学肥料等等。
    提纲说，农业方面，1962年农产品总产值将达到四百亿到四百五十亿列弗。1965年农产品总产值将达到六百亿列弗，即比1957年所生产的多四百五十亿列弗。1965年将生产六百六十万吨谷物和青饲料。
    提纲接着说，在迅速发展工农业生产的基础上，到1965年，国民收入将达到一千亿至一千一百亿列弗，即比1957年约增加75％。劳动生产率将大大提高。
    全国经济的迅速高涨将使人民消费量大大增加，到1962年，人民消费量将比1957年增加一倍（原计划为40％），而到1965年将增加两倍。
    提纲强调说，解决这些经济任务，将意味着为全国逐步从社会主义过渡到共产主义提供物质前提。
    提纲说：“在农业发展方面发生了伟大的历史性转折。党创造性地运用了列宁的合作化计划，保证了社会主义在保加利亚农村的胜利。”现在，社会主义农业有六百八十个大型农业生产合作社，五十四个国营农场和二百零九个机器拖拉机站。
    报告提纲说，文化革命正在顺利进行。现在，保加利亚约有一百三十万人在各类学校中学习，建立了二十所高等学校，其中有四万多学生在学习。
    提纲着重指出保加利亚共产党中央委员会十月和十一月全会对进一步加速保加利亚社会主义建设的特别重要意义。提纲说，党提出的争取在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）的口号已经成为与人民群众血肉相关的事业和强大的物质力量，并已形成一个全民运动。这个全民运动的一些初步实际效果证明，保加利亚共产党中央委员会10月和11月全会给保加利亚人民提出的巨大任务是能够胜利完成的。
    提纲在谈到改进国家和经济领导的具体措施时说，现在对按照专业性质的行政管理的集中采取适当的限制和按照地区建立约三十个行政经济区来代替现有的十三个州（包括相当于州的市）和一百一十七个县（包括相当于县的市）是适宜的。这就是说，各专业部和主管机关将把一些实际领导国民经济的职权交给地方组织——州人民会议。国民经济领导重心转到地方后，就使得经济领导机关接近了企业和生产。
    提纲指出，今后仍然必须保持集中的计划，集中拨款和集中预算，要善于在发展经济的重要方向上把地方管理同集中的计划、资金的集中调动，以及经济资源的集中支配结合起来。
    提纲指出，行政经济区在农业方面的基本经济生产单位将是农业生产合作社，农村的手工业生产合作社，一部分现有的地方工业企业也将归并到这种扩大了的农业生产合作社中来。行政经济区在工业方面的基本生产单位是工业企业，这些企业将直属行政经济区人民会议领导。为了更充分地利用工业的全部潜力，共和国工业和地方工业的同类企业必须进行合并。
    提纲指出，为了进一步改善部长会议的工作和更好地发挥社会主义国家的职能，应该取消至今还存在的一些专业部，而在部长会议之下设立国家计划委员会、工业和技术改进委员会、建设和建筑委员会、劳动和价格委员会、卫生和社会问题委员会、国家监察委员会、中央统计局。
    提纲很注意进一步巩固和发展农业合作化制度。提纲说，保加利亚已经基本上完成了扩大农业生产合作社的过程，这意味着在保加利亚农村发展合作制度的新的更高阶段的开始。现在组成了六百八十个大型农业合作社代替过去的三千四百五十个农业合作社。
    提纲指出，在巩固保加利亚的合作制度及其所取得的胜利中，机器拖拉机站起了巨大的积极作用。农业合作社的扩大提出了按苏联的例子着手逐步改组机器拖拉机站和把拖拉机、联合收割机及其他农业机器直接出售给合作社的合宜性的问题，以便在五年计划完成时，在国内各个行政经济区的农业合作社都有能力获得机器拖拉机站技术设备的主要部分。
    日夫科夫在报告提纲中还谈到保加利亚农业合作社从集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的问题。他说，要从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制必须在农业方面完成下列三个深刻的转变：逐步把农业生产资料集体所有制提高到全民所有制的水平；改进农业劳动报酬社会主义原则的规定，逐步缩小各个合作社同一数量和质量的劳动的报酬差别，以便将来达到城乡劳动报酬的完全一致；由于合作社社员的劳动逐步接近产业工人的劳动，社员的劳动将变为工业化劳动的一种形式。
    为了解放家庭妇女的劳动力，日夫科夫建议采取下列措施：在各地开办公共食堂；在城乡各地增设托儿所、幼儿园；开设新的公共洗衣房和浴室；大大降低儿童服装和鞋的售价，降低有两个或两个以上子女的家长为他们的子女在学校食堂、托儿所和幼儿园所付的伙食费。
    提纲指出，现在已经有必要取消国家农产品义务交售制，而代之以新的按照统一收购价格的农产品统一收购制，这样可以促进农业进一步迅速发展。农业面临一个巨大的任务——在两年内使农产品生产增加两倍。
    提纲接着指出，有必要改进劳动报酬制度，提高低工资劳动者的工资，逐渐向缩短工作日过渡。必需迅速发展农村的公共设施和扩大农村社会服务机构和文化机构网，以便克服城乡文化发展的不平衡现象。
    提纲最后说，这些措施是迫切的，在客观上是必须的。它们涉及到国家经济发展的根本问题，它们是由实际生活、社会主义实践，保加利亚社会主义经济的内部发展，保加利亚的国际主义义务，以及必须扩大保加利亚在社会主义阵营同帝国主义阵营进行的总的竞赛中的贡献这件事所决定的。这个纲领对保加利亚进一步的全面发展，对提高保加利亚的经济实力，对大大提高保加利亚人民的物质生活和文化水平有着历史性的意义。
    提纲强调说：“保加利亚共产党的英明领导，保加利亚人民的热爱劳动，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致是这种胜利的保证。”
