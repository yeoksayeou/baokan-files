    工业生产平地起家
    农业机械从无到有
    本报讯　山西省阳泉市岩会人民公社在整社中，以社会主义和共产主义教育为纲，组织冬季生产，同时，运用边整边改的办法，解决社员在生活中的各种实际困难，并通过检查总结1958年的工作，肯定了公社化后各项工作所获得的巨大成就，干部和群众思想觉悟显著提高，从而大大地促进了冬季生产运动。
    整社开始，公社党委以检查总结1958年工作为内容，发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论、贴大字报，以肯定成绩，找出缺点，分清是非，找出改进办法。经过辩论，全体社员和干部都明确了1958年全社在钢铁、粮食、思想方面都获得了巨大的丰收，具体表现在下列十大变化：（一）工业生产平地起家。在大搞钢铁运动中，建炉五十八座，炼钢三千七百四十四吨；（二）农业机器从无到有。公社化后全社安装了各种动力机器十五部，自造滚珠轴承一千零四十套，绳索牵引机八部，共节省劳力八万多个；（三）邮电交通事业四通八达。全社修建了三条长达六十华里的公路，基本上做到了场场有电话，村村有喇叭；（四）农业生产大丰收。全社由缺粮地区变为余粮地区；（五）造林事业蓬勃发展。公社化后共植树一百四十二万余株，等于1957年植树量的四倍；（六）牧畜事业成倍增长。公社化后养猪比1957年增加了七倍，养羊增加了42％，还发展了养兔、养蜂及养鱼等生产；
  （七）文化教育事业大发展。中学由三所增为七所，高小由七所增为十九所，小学由八十一所增为八十九所。此外，还兴办了俱乐部及图书馆等；（八）福利卫生事业全面开花结果。全社实现了“四无四洁”的指标，新建地区医院三个，基本上做到了大病不出社，小病不出保健站。敬老院、托儿所、幼儿园、公共食堂、缝纫厂及妇产院等福利事业也举办起来了；（九）供销工作的收购总额较1957年增长了两倍，生产资料的供应增加了四倍，销售总额也较1957年增加了12.3％；（十）在水利建设上，水地面积由一千二百亩增加到三千六百四十亩，大大增强了战胜自然的能力。
    在运动中部分干部也检查了自己过去在工作中关心群众生活不够，管理方面缺乏民主作风等缺点，表示今后决心改正。
    岩会人民公社的全体社员经过了这段运动之后，都提高了思想觉悟，积极投入了冬季生产运动，仅在积肥工作中社员们便找到了十七种肥源，在十天里就积了各种肥料一百三十九万担，制造了土化肥十三万四千斤。
