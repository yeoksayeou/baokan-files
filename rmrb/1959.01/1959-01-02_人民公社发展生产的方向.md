The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction has victoriously concluded. This conference was a review of the brilliant achievements of 1958 and a mobilization meeting to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. The representatives of the advanced units widely exchanged rich experiences at the conference and, after serious discussion, unanimously supported the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. On this basis, the conference put forward ten proposals to the people's communes in rural areas throughout the country. This is a great proposal and a bugle call for marching forward. This proposal will surely be warmly received by rural workers and all farmers across the country and will powerfully promote a new upsurge in China's rural socialist construction.

The Ten Proposals put forward the fighting program for the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of rural people's communes in 1959. That is to say, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the task of producing 1,050 billion jin of grain and 100 million dan of cotton, and strive to exceed these targets; at the same time, it is necessary to ensure greater development of oil crops and bast fiber crops, doubling the output of edible vegetable oil and reaching 20 million dan of bast fiber; while vigorously developing agricultural production, it is also necessary to double the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and to increase the industrial output value of the people's communes by at least one time, and the output value of commodities by about one time; while developing production, it is also necessary to do a good job in commerce and transportation, to improve the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production, and to strive for a greater leap forward in science, culture, education, health, and sports. In order to achieve the above-mentioned great goals, the Ten Proposals put forward two things to be done well in the near future: one is to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, and the other is to earnestly do a good job in winter production. The Ten Proposals also emphasized the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter," the implementation of garden-style cultivation, the universal increase of unit area yield, and the launching of a large-scale high-yield field movement. All of these are undoubtedly very important. The realization of these goals will have great significance for the consolidation and development of the people's communes, for the prosperity of China's economy and culture, and for the further improvement of people's lives.

The Ten Proposals of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction are mainly based on the production guidelines of the people's communes stipulated in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. We would like to take this opportunity to talk about the production guidelines of the people's communes.

The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party clearly pointed out: "Developing production is the central link in consolidating and improving the people's communes. The correct policy for developing production in people's communes should be: according to the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, according to the principle of diligence and thrift in running communes, implementing simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production." The emergence and development of any new and progressive social system are the result of the development of social productive forces. Without the development of productive forces, without the development of production, the new social system (including the people's communes) cannot be born, and even if it is born, it cannot be consolidated or improved. However, in order to consolidate and improve the people's communes, to develop the production of the people's communes, why must we implement the simultaneous development of industrial production and agricultural production, and the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production?

Proportional development of the national economy is an objective economic law. The two major sectors of the national economy—industry and agriculture—must also develop according to this law. To achieve high-speed development in agriculture, mechanization and electrification are needed, which means that industry needs to provide agriculture with new-style technical equipment; similarly, only when agriculture provides more grain and raw materials and absorbs a large number of industrial products can industry develop rapidly. Precisely for this reason, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the principle of "simultaneous development of industry and agriculture under the premise of giving priority to the development of heavy industry" as the guiding principle for China's socialist economic construction. In recent years, especially the high-speed development of China's economic construction in 1958, the facts have proved that this principle is completely correct. Now, the Party Central Committee, based on the new situation of the realization of communization in rural areas throughout the country, has once again taken the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture as the production policy of the people's communes. It cannot be considered that the implementation of the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is only a matter for the whole country or a province and autonomous region, and that the commune only needs to engage in agriculture. It must be known that the development of the commune economy must also take two legs, developing both agriculture and industry. Only in this way can the commune quickly become prosperous. Of course, to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, it is mainly necessary to rely on national industrialization, but whether it is from the perspective of rapidly developing the commune economy at the present stage, or from the long-term perspective of gradually narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, it is necessary to realize commune industrialization, that is, to vigorously develop the industry of the commune while developing agriculture. The Ten Proposals' proposal to increase the industrial output value of the people's communes in 1959 by at least one time compared with 1958 is completely necessary.

Closely related to the simultaneous development of industrial and agricultural production is the issue of the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production. The people's commune must of course develop production specifically to meet the needs of production and the lives of its members, but no commune, even the one with the best conditions, can completely rely on its own production to meet all its needs, and it is completely unnecessary to do so. Because the national economy is a whole, not only should there be mutual exchange between regions, but also between communes, developing production according to local natural conditions and strengths. This kind of social division of labor is the most economical and reasonable. It is not necessary nor possible for any commune to "close itself off" and be "self-sufficient." China currently does not have too many commodities, but rather too few. Commodity production and commodity exchange in China are not very developed, but very underdeveloped. Therefore, the development of commodity production and commodity exchange is an economic policy for a fairly long period of time. Some comrades do not like the word "commodity," as if it is somewhat disgraceful for socialism to be linked to commodities. In fact, this is a misunderstanding of commodities. Commodities are the inevitable product of the development of the social economy to a certain level, and they will only disappear when the social economy develops to another necessary level. They are produced or eliminated regardless of whether people like them or not. To dislike or even fear commodity production is probably because these comrades confuse commodity production with capitalism, or mistakenly believe that commodity production will lead to capitalism. Commodity production and capitalism are not the same thing, and commodity production does not necessarily lead to capitalism. Only in a society where there is private ownership of the means of production, where there is a system of capitalists exploiting wage workers, will commodity production lead to capitalism. China is a country that has completed the socialist revolution and implemented socialist public ownership. Commodity production not only cannot lead to capitalism, but will only greatly benefit the development of the socialist economy. With commodity production and commodity exchange, China's socialist economy will become more active, and the lives of the Chinese people will become richer and more colorful. Taking the people's commune as an example, by developing commodity production, the broad masses of commune members not only have enough agricultural products, but also can obtain various industrial products through commodity exchange. Therefore, the Ten Proposals' proposal to increase the commodity output value of the people's communes in 1959 by one time compared with 1958 is completely necessary. Of course, the commodity production and commodity exchange of the people's communes must be carried out under the guidance of the unified national plan and be subject to national leadership and management, so as to avoid a state of anarchy, which would be detrimental to the commune and to the country.

Implementing the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production, the people's communes must vigorously develop diversified operations, which has more urgent and practical significance at present. 1958 was the first year of the Great Leap Forward. In order to lay the foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future, all localities first focused on water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation movements, and grain production, which was completely necessary and correct; after the autumn of last year, in order to allow the "steel marshal" to ascend the platform as soon as possible, the people's communes vigorously carried out the mass steelmaking movement, which was also necessary and correct. Precisely because of this, China's ability to resist two major disasters—floods and droughts—was greatly enhanced last year. Although the weather was not good, it still achieved an unprecedented harvest and created favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in China's agricultural production in the future. The early ascension of the two marshals—grain and steel—has decisive significance for accelerating the pace of China's socialist construction. However, with the basic solution of the grain problem, while continuing to increase the output and improve the quality of grain, people's communes in various localities must gradually increase the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, flax, silk, soybeans, oil crops, sugar crops, tea, tobacco, and medicinal materials in the entire agricultural production, and pay great attention to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. The Ten Proposals have put forward the 1959 targets for the above-mentioned production, and require that the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should increase by one time compared with 1958, which is completely necessary. In the production of 1959, special attention should be paid to increasing the production of cotton, oil crops, and bast fiber crops, striving to basically pass the test in these three aspects after a year of hard work; at the same time, special attention should also be paid to increasing livestock, which is very urgent not only for solving the lack of animal power in agriculture, but also for solving the supply of meat. In short, only when the commune's industrial raw material crops are developed, only when the commune's various economies such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are developed, only when the commune's industrial production is developed, only when the commune's commodity production is developed and can produce a large number of industrial and agricultural products for commodity exchange with other communes and with the state, can the public accumulation of the people's communes be greatly increased, and the income of the commune members can be rapidly increased. The increase in commune accumulation can strengthen the material strength of the commune's expanded reproduction; the increase in commune members' income and the improvement of their lives can promote the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. Once strong material strength is combined with the enthusiasm of the masses, it will enable the commune's various production and construction undertakings to develop faster and greater.

On the basis of a bumper harvest in agriculture, people's communes in various localities have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply systems, and the broad masses of male and female farmers have begun to receive their own wages. Families that used to worry about food, firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea can now "eat without money," which means they have obtained the most important and reliable social insurance. However, since China's social products are not yet very abundant, it should not and cannot rapidly expand the scope of the supply system. The wage portion of commune members' income distributed according to labor will occupy an important position for a long time, and will occupy a major position for a period of time. In order to promote the labor enthusiasm of commune members and thus promote the rapid development of commune production, and also to make it easier for commune members to meet the complex needs in their lives, the commune must gradually increase the wages earned by commune members, and must increase them faster than the supply portion in several years. How can people's communes ensure that commune members are paid on time? How can the wage income portion of commune members be increased and improved faster? The only way is to develop diversified operations and develop commodity production. After the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, especially after the bumper harvest of grain crops, China's commodity production and commodity circulation have undergone new changes in terms of the variety of products and the laws of circulation. In the past, grain, which occupied the main commodity position in agricultural products, has been able to be self-sufficient or even have a surplus in most communes and even in the communes of economic crop areas due to the universal bumper harvest in various parts of the country. Although some grain is still sold to the state as a commodity, the quantity is limited after all. As for exchanges between communes, grain as a commodity will be greatly reduced. This raises a question for people's communes in various localities: if they want to increase cash income, if they want to have money to buy more industrial products to meet the needs of commune production and the lives of commune members, if they want to be able to issue commune members' wages on time and increase commune members' wage income faster, it is no longer possible to rely on grain or mainly rely on grain for exchange. It is necessary to greatly develop economic crops and greatly develop industrial raw material crops while continuing to develop grain production. It is necessary to vigorously develop commune industrial production and handicraft production. Only when these products are greatly increased can the commune carry out more extensive commodity exchange with the state and with other communes, and only these products can be exchanged for the means of production and means of livelihood needed by the commune, and increase the commune's cash income and increase the commune's accumulation.

At present, in order to seize the time to implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, party committees at all levels should help the people's communes to do two things well. The first thing is to formulate the production plan of each commune for 1959 on the basis of conscientiously studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session and according to the Ten Proposals of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction while rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. This production plan should not only reflect the requirements of the unified national plan, but also give full play to its own characteristics and reflect the principle of adapting to local conditions; it should not only vigorously develop agriculture and self-sufficient production, but also vigorously develop industry and commodity production. The second thing is to lead all communes to tightly grasp the period from now until the spring plowing, vigorously engage in sideline production, and strive to set off a high tide of sideline production. Doing so can not only solve the wage problem of commune members, but also prepare more sufficient funds and stronger material strength for the comprehensive development of commune production in 1959. When arranging winter sideline production, special attention should be paid to rationally allocating labor according to the policy of developing diversified operations.

Now, the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction has successfully concluded. We hope that after the representatives return to their respective localities, they will implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party into practical work, and turn the Ten Proposals put forward at this conference into the practical actions of the broad masses of the people, so as to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed on behalf of the Party Central Committee in his speech at this conference.

    人民公社发展生产的方向
    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议已经胜利闭幕了。这次会议是1958年辉煌成就的检阅大会，又是1959年争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进的誓师大会。各先进单位的代表们在会议上广泛地交流了丰富的经验，并且经过认真的讨论，一致拥护党的八届六中全会的决议。在这个基础上，会议向全国农村人民公社提出了十大倡议。这是一个伟大的倡议，也是进军的号角。这个倡议一定会得到全国农村工作者和全体农民的热烈响应，并将有力地促进我国农村社会主义建设事业的新的高涨。
    十大倡议提出了农村人民公社在1959年全面大跃进的奋斗纲领。这就是说，要保证完成粮食产量一万零五百亿斤和棉花产量一亿担的任务，并且力争超过；同时又要保证油料作物和麻类作物有更大的发展，使食用植物油的产量增加一倍，麻类产量达到二千万担；在大力发展农业生产的同时，还要使林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的产值增加一倍左右，使人民公社的工业产值至少增加一倍，使商品的产值增加一倍左右；在发展生产的同时，还要做好商业工作和交通运输，要在发展生产的基础上改善群众的生活，要争取科学、文化、教育、卫生和体育事业更大的跃进。为了实现上述的伟大目标，十大倡议中提出在最近期间要做好两件事，其一是整顿和巩固人民公社，其二是切实做好冬季生产。十大倡议还强调认真执行“八字宪法”，实行耕作园田化，普遍提高单位面积产量，开展大面积高产田运动。所有这些，毫无疑问都是十分重要的。这些目标的实现，对于人民公社的巩固和发展，对于我国经济和文化的繁荣，对于人民生活的进一步改善，都具有重大的意义。
    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的十大倡议，主要是根据党的八届六中全会的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”所规定的人民公社的生产方针而提出的。我们想趁这个机会，来谈一谈关于人民公社的生产方针的问题。
    党的八届六中全会的决议明确指出：“发展生产是巩固和提高人民公社的中心环节。人民公社发展生产的正确方针应当是：根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。”任何一种新的进步的社会制度的产生和发展，都是社会生产力发展的结果。没有生产力的发展，没有生产的发展，新的社会制度（包括人民公社在内）是不可能诞生的，诞生了也不能巩固、不能提高。但是，要巩固、提高人民公社，要发展人民公社的生产，为什么一定要实行工业生产和农业生产同时并举、自给性的生产和商品性的生产同时并举呢？
    国民经济按比例发展是客观的经济法则。国民经济的两大部门——工业和农业也必须按照这个法则发展。农业要实现高速度的发展，需要机械化电气化，也就是说需要工业供给农业新式的技术装备；同样，只有农业更多地供给粮食、原料并大量地吸收工业品，工业才能迅速地发展。正因为这个缘故，党中央和毛泽东同志很早以前就把“在优先发展重工业的前提下，实行工农业同时并举”作为我国进行社会主义经济建设的方针。几年来，特别是1958年我国经济建设事业高速度的发展的事实证明，这个方针是完全正确的。现在，党中央根据全国农村实现了公社化的新情况，又把工农业同时并举作为人民公社的生产方针。不能认为，实行工农业并举的方针只是全国范围或者一个省和自治区范围的事，公社只搞农业就行了。要知道公社经济的发展，也必须两条腿走路，既发展农业，也发展工业。只有这样，公社才能迅速富裕起来。当然，要实现农业机械化、电气化，主要地要依靠国家工业化，但是，无论从现阶段迅速发展公社经济来说，或者从长远的逐步缩小城乡差别和工农差别来说，必须实现公社工业化，就是说，在发展农业的同时大力发展公社的工业。十大倡议中提出1959年人民公社的工业产值比1958年至少要增加一倍是完全必要的。
    同工农业生产同时并举紧密有关的是自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的问题。人民公社当然要发展专为满足本公社生产和社员生活所需要的生产，但是，无论那个公社，即使条件最好的公社，也不可能完全靠自己的生产来满足一切需要，而且也完全不必要这样做。因为全国经济是一个整体，不仅各个地区之间，而且各个公社之间，应该根据当地的自然条件和特长来发展生产，互通有无。这种社会分工是最经济、最合理的。任何一个公社，不必要也不可能“闭关自守”、“自给自足”。我国目前不是商品太多，而是还很少。我国商品生产和商品交换，不是很发达，而是很不发达。因此，发展商品生产和商品交换是一个相当长时期的经济政策。有些同志不喜欢“商品”这个字眼，好像社会主义同商品联系在一起有些不光彩。其实，这是对商品的误解。商品，是社会经济发展到一定水平的必然产物，也只有社会经济发展到另一必需的水平时才会消亡，它不以人们的喜欢或不喜欢而产生或消灭的。讨厌甚至害怕商品生产，大概是由于这些同志把商品生产同资本主义混同起来了，或者误认为一搞商品生产就会产生资本主义了。商品生产同资本主义不是一个东西，商品生产也不一定产生资本主义。只有存在着生产资料私有制，存在着资本家剥削雇佣工人的制度的社会里，商品生产才会产生资本主义。我国是完成了社会主义革命，实行了社会主义公有制的国家，商品生产不仅不能产生资本主义，而且只会对社会主义经济发展大有好处。有了商品生产和商品交换，就会使我国的社会主义经济更加活跃，就会使我国人民的生活更加丰富多彩。拿人民公社来说，发展商品生产，广大社员不仅有足够的农产品，还能够通过商品交换获得各种各样的工业品。因此，十大倡议中提出1959年人民公社的商品产值要比1958年增加一倍是完全必要的。当然，人民公社的商品生产和商品交换，必须在国家统一计划的指导下进行，接受国家领导和管理，这样才能避免无政府状态，否则对公社、对国家都是不利的。
    实行工农业并举、自给生产和商品生产并举的方针，人民公社就必须大力发展多种经营，这在目前更有其迫切的现实意义。1958年是大跃进的第一年，为了给今后农业生产的更大跃进打下基础，各地都首先抓住了水利建设、积肥运动和粮食生产，这是完全必要的正确的；去年入秋以后，为了使钢铁元帅早日升帐，人民公社又大力开展了全民炼钢运动，这也是必要的正确的。正因为如此，我国去年抗拒两大主要灾害——水灾和旱灾的能力大大增强了，虽然天时并不好，但是仍然获得了空前的丰收，并且为今后我国农业生产的更大跃进创造了良好的条件。两大元帅——粮食和钢铁元帅早日升帐，对于加速了我国社会主义建设的步伐，有着决定性的意义。但是，随着粮食问题的基本解决，各地人民公社在继续增加粮食的产量和提高粮食的质量的同时，必须逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中的比重，并且极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展。十大倡议中对上述生产都提出了1959年的指标，并且要求林、牧、副、渔的产值要比1958年增加一倍，这是完全必要的。在1959年的生产中，要特别注意增加棉花、油料作物、麻类作物的生产，争取在这三方面经过一年苦战基本过关；同时，也还要特别注意增加牲畜，这不仅对于解决农业的畜力不足，而且对于解决肉食的供应，都是非常迫切的。总之，只有公社的工业原料作物发展了，只有公社的林、牧、副、渔各种经济发展了，只有公社的工业生产发展了，只有公社的商品生产发展并且能够拿出大量的工农业产品同其他公社、同国家进行商品交换了，人民公社的公共积累才能大量增加，社员的收入才能迅速提高。公社积累增加能够加强公社扩大再生产的物质力量；社员收入提高生活改善，能够促进广大社员的劳动积极性。雄厚的物质力量一旦和群众的积极性结合起来，便会使公社的各项生产建设事业更快更大地发展起来。
    在农业大丰收的基础上，各地人民公社实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，广大的男女农民开始领得自己的工资，而过去经常愁吃愁喝、愁柴米油盐酱醋茶的家庭，从此可以“吃饭不要钱”，也就是说得到了最重要和最可靠的社会保险。但是，由于我国目前的社会产品还不太丰富，不应该也不可能迅速扩大供给制的范围，社员收入中按劳分配的工资部分，在长时期内必将占有重要地位，在一段时期内并将占有主要地位。为了促进社员的劳动积极性从而促进公社生产的迅速发展，也为了使社员在生活中的复杂的需要比较容易满足，公社必须使社员所得的工资逐步增加，并且在若干年内必须比供给部分增加得更快。人民公社怎样才能保证按时给社员发工资呢？怎样才能使社员的工资收入部分增加和提高得更快呢？唯一的办法是发展多种经营，发展商品生产。农业大跃进以后，特别是粮食作物大丰收以后，我国的商品生产和商品流通无论在产品的种类上，或者在流通的规律上，都已起了新的变化。过去曾经在农产品中占主要商品地位的粮食，由于全国各地普遍大丰收，大多数的公社甚至经济作物区的公社粮食都已能够自给甚至有余了。虽然仍有一部粮食作为商品出售给国家，但数量毕竟是有限的。至于公社之间，粮食作为商品去进行交换将会大大缩小。这就给各地人民公社提出了一个问题：要想增加现金收入，要想有钱购买更多的工业产品以满足公社生产和社员生活上的需要，要想能够按时发放社员工资并更快地增加社员的工资收入，只靠粮食或主要靠粮食去进行交换已经不行了，必须在继续发展粮食生产的同时大大发展经济作物，大大发展工业原料作物，必须大力发展公社的工业生产和手工业生产。只有这些产品大量增加了，公社才能同国家、同其他公社进行更广泛的商品交换，也只有这些产品才能够换回公社需要的生产资料和生活资料，并且增加公社的现金收入、增加公社的积累。
    目前，为了抓紧时间贯彻实行党的八届六中全会的决议，各级党委要帮助人民公社作好两件事情。第一件事情是在认真学习六中全会决议的基础上，在整顿和巩固人民公社的同时，根据全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的十大倡议，制定各个公社1959年的生产规划。这个生产规划既要体现国家统一计划的要求，又要充分发挥自己的特点，体现因地制宜的原则；既要大力发展农业和自给性的生产，又要大力发展工业和商品生产。第二件事情是领导各个公社紧紧抓住从现在起到春耕前这一段时间，大搞副业生产，务期掀起一个副业生产的高潮。这样作，不仅能够解决社员工资问题，也能够为1959年公社全面发展生产，准备更充足的资金和更雄厚的物质力量。而在安排冬季副业生产的时候，要特别注意根据发展多种经营的方针合理地分配劳动力。
    现在，全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议圆满结束了。我们希望，代表们回到各地方之后，把党的八届六中全会的决议贯彻到实际工作中去，把这次会议所提出的十大倡议变为广大人民群众的实际行动，像刘少奇同志代表党中央在这次会议上致词中所提出的那样，在1959年争取更大更好更全面的跃进。
