    Self-Reliance Overcomes Difficulties
    Rapidly Changing the Face of Industrial Backwardness

    (Our dispatch) The industrial development of Qinghai Province is changing with each passing day, and the face of industrial backwardness in the past is accelerating its transformation.

    In the all-round Great Leap Forward of various construction undertakings in Qinghai Province in 1958, the whole Party and the entire people engaged in industry. Based on local needs and raw materials, they relied on their own efforts to build a large number of factories and mines in just a few months. Now, in Qinghai Province, from the agricultural areas in the east to the Qaidam Basin in the west, from the Kunlun Mountains in the south to the Qilian Mountains in the north, factories and mines can be seen everywhere, whether in valleys or on plains, in agricultural areas or on grasslands. At present, more than 160 factories and mines above the county level have been built in the province (not including the more than 35,000 factories and mines established by the people's communes), an increase of eighteen times compared with the number of factories and mines in the early days of liberation, and an increase of 1.3 times compared with 1957. Last year's total industrial output value increased by more than double that of the previous year. The output and variety of major industrial products have greatly increased compared with the previous year. New products successfully trial-produced and mass-produced last year include metallurgical equipment such as blast furnaces and converters, power equipment such as generators, motors, and gas engines, large-scale crushing machinery and machine tools, and twelve-row seeders, bacterial fertilizers, and chemical fertilizers. These products have strongly supported the development of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production in the province.

    The industry of Qinghai Province has developed from nothing to something, from small to large. In this province, which did not produce an ounce of iron in the past, iron-smelting plants were universally established in various prefectures and counties last year. Now, not only has iron been produced, but steel has also been produced, and various machines and agricultural implements have been made from steel smelted from local iron. This place, which in the past did not even have the raw materials to produce a thread or an inch of cloth, used wild plants to manufacture artificial cotton last year, and wove cloth and made cotton wadding. Small factories and handicraft cooperatives that could only make parts and engage in repair and assembly in the past have now developed into factories capable of producing large-scale machinery such as 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces and two-ton converters. Last year, not only did the production capacity and technical level of industries such as coal, electricity, and machinery in Qinghai Province greatly improve compared with the previous year, but also new metallurgical, petroleum, chemical, and building materials industries emerged. At the same time, light industries such as sugar refining, papermaking, dairy products, and food also developed rapidly with a brand-new attitude.

    In the development of industry, the 200,000-plus workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises in Qinghai Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, fought with selfless labor, soaring energy, and all kinds of difficulties. When equipment was insufficient, they adopted methods such as ants gnawing bones, manufacturing indigenous machine tools, and improving tools to produce large machines; when technical strength was weak, they adopted methods such as learning from each other, learning from other places, and researching and producing at the same time to solve the problem; and they adopted methods such as saving and using substitutes to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply. If one factory could not produce a product, several factories cooperated to produce it together. In this way, many kinds of difficulties were overcome by them one by one. (Li Ying)

    自力更生克服困难
    工业落后面貌迅速改变
    本报讯　青海省工业的发展日新月异，过去工业落后的面貌正在加速地改变着。
    青海省在1958年各项建设事业全面大跃进中，全党全民办工业，根据本地需要和原材料等情况，自力更生，在短短的几个月内，兴建了大批厂矿。现在青海省内，东自农业区，西到柴达木，南到昆仑山，北至祁连山，不论在山谷，还是在平地，在农业区或在草原，都可见到工厂和矿山。目前省内已建成了县营以上的厂矿一百六十多个（人民公社兴办的三万五千多个厂矿不包括在内），比解放初期的厂矿数增长了十八倍，比1957年增长了一点三倍。去年的工业生产总值比前年增长了一倍多。主要工业产品的产量和种类都比前年大为提高和增多。去年试制成功并大量生产的新产品有高炉、转炉等冶金设备，有发电机、电动机、煤气机等动力设备，有大型的粉碎机械和工作母机，有十二行播种机、细菌肥料、化学肥料等。这些产品有力地支援了本省工农牧业生产的发展。
    青海省的工业是从无到有，从小到大地发展起来的。这个过去寸铁不产的省份，去年在各州、县普遍建立了炼铁厂，现在不仅已生产出了铁，而且还生产了钢，并用土铁炼出来的钢制成了各种机器和农具。这个过去连生产一根线、一寸布的原料都没有的地方，去年利用野生植物制造了人造棉，并织成了布，制成了棉絮。过去只能作些零件和搞修配的小工厂、手工业社，现在已发展到能生产十三立方的高炉、两吨的转炉等大型机械的工厂了。去年，青海省内不仅煤、电、机械等工业生产能力和技术水平比前年大为提高，而且有了新兴的冶金、石油、化工、建筑材料业。同时，制糖、造纸、乳制品、食品等轻工业也以崭新的姿态迅速地发展起来。
    在发展工业中，青海省工矿企业的二十几万职工在各级党委的领导下，以忘我的劳动、冲天的干劲和各种困难进行着斗争。设备不足，他们就采取蚂蚁啃骨头、制造土机床、改进工具等办法来生产大机器；技术力量薄弱，就采取互相学习，到外地学习，边研究、边生产的办法加以解决；并采取节约、用代用品等办法来克服原材料供应不足的困难。一种产品一个工厂不能生产，就几个厂共同协作生产。就这样，好多种困难都被他们一一克服了。　（李瑛）
