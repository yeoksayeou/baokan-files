Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th - The Vietnam News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement refuting the message reported by the United States' United Press International on the 9th regarding the statement made by the Lao Kingdom Government's Minister of Propaganda, Nane Champa regarding the Vietnam-Laos border issue.

The message said that Nane Champa believed that the troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had invaded the territory of Chebang in Laos, causing two hundred Lao households to cross the border and flee to Vietnam. Nane Champa also said that the purpose of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's troops invading the Lao border was to force the International Commission in Laos to continue to stay there.

The Vietnam News Agency issued a statement saying: The troops of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have absolutely not taken any actions to invade the territory of the Kingdom of Laos. Xiangli Township is the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has clearly affirmed this in telegrams and letters sent to the government of the Kingdom of Laos on December 28, 1958, and January 1, 5, and 8, 1959. The statement said that in the past period, no Laotians have ever crossed the Vietnamese border. Therefore, the above message is completely unfounded.

The statement said that the events created by the troops of the Kingdom of Laos in Xiangli Township in the border area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are acts of infringing upon the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The opposition of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the above-mentioned acts of infringing upon the Vietnamese border has absolutely nothing to do with the implementation of the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue, or with the International Commission in Laos itself.

The statement said that the above message is completely fabricated and distorts the facts, and its purpose is to create tension between the two countries and to pave the way for American imperialism to further interfere in Laos and drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. This only benefits imperialism and its lackeys, and is absolutely not beneficial to the people of Vietnam and Laos.

The statement said that the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always been: hoping that both sides will improve the neighborly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos on the principle of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity; all disputes between the two countries must be resolved peacefully.

### 越南通讯社受权发表声明  越南军队并未侵犯老挝领土  希望以和平方式解决两国争端

    越南通讯社受权发表声明
    越南军队并未侵犯老挝领土
    希望以和平方式解决两国争端
    新华社河内12日电　越南通讯社今天受权发表声明，驳斥美国合众国际社在9日报道的关于老挝王国政府宣传大臣纳强帕萨就越南和老挝边境问题发表的声明的消息。
    消息说，纳强帕萨认为，越南民主共和国军队曾经侵犯了老挝领土的切邦，并且使得老挝二百户居民越过国境，逃往越南。纳强帕萨还说，越南民主共和国军队侵犯老挝国境的目的，是为了迫使老挝国际委员会继续留在那里。
    越南通讯社发表声明说：越南民主共和国军队完全没有侵犯老挝王国领土的行动。向立乡是越南民主共和国的领土。越南民主共和国政府在1958年12月28日和1959年1月1日、5日和8日发给老挝王国政府的电报和信件中都明确地肯定了这一点。声明说，在过去一段时期，从来没有任何一家老挝人越过越南边境。因此，上迹消息完全没有根据。
    声明说，老挝王国军队在越南民主共和国边境地区的向立乡所制造的事件是侵犯越南民主共和国领土和主权的行为。越南民主共和国政府反对上述侵犯越南国境的行为，同履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，同老挝国际委员会本身都毫无关系。
    声明说，上述消息完全是捏造和歪曲事实的，其目的在于制造两国之间的紧张局势，为美帝国主义进一步干涉老挝和把老挝拖入东南亚侵略集团开辟道路。这只有利于帝国主义和它的走狗，而绝对不利于越南和老挝人民。
    声明说，越南民主共和国的立场始终是：希望双方在互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则上，改善越南民主共和国同老挝王国之间的邻邦关系；两国之间的一切争端都必须以和平方式求得解决。
