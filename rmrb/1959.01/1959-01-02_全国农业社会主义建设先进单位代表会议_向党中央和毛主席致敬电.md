The National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction
A Letter of Salute to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao

Respected Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

We, the entire body of representatives attending the National Congress of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, bring the heartfelt wishes of the nation's 500 million farmers, and extend our most sublime and sincere respects to our beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, in 1958, China's agricultural production achieved a great historical victory. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all experienced unprecedented bumper harvests, achieving the grain and cotton production increase targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule, creating a miracle unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. On the basis of the great leap forward in agricultural production, rural areas across the country realized people's communes in a very short period, bringing China's agriculture into a new historical period. Simultaneously with the great leap forward in production, the patriotic health campaign, centered on eliminating the four pests, also saw leaping development throughout the country. Our lives have also been further improved and will be further improved in the future.

We deeply know that all of this was achieved under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. At this meeting, we earnestly studied the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the resolution on several questions concerning the people's communes, and listened to the cordial instructions given to us by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee. We listened to the reports of Premier Zhou and other responsible comrades. We, representing the farmers of the whole country, pledge to the Party and Chairman Mao that we will follow the instructions of the Party and work with the people of the whole country to strive to implement the Party's resolutions.

We have put forward ten major initiatives to the people's communes and all farmer brothers and sisters in rural areas across the country. In line with the central government's instructions to promote both industry and agriculture, and both self-sufficient production and commodity production, we will ensure the completion and strive to exceed the 1959 production targets for grain and cotton. We will ensure that oil crops, hemp, sugar crops, tobacco leaves, silk, tea, and other various industrial raw material crops all complete and overfulfill the increased production targets set by the state. We must earnestly do a good job in the current field management of overwintering crops and the preparations for spring sowing. We must conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase. We will launch a large-scale high-yield field campaign. We will comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production, and supply more and better non-staple foods needed by cities. And we will run industries on a large scale according to conditions. We will gradually realize the all-round revolution in the five sectors of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and completely change the face of the entire agricultural front.

While developing production, we will also run public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly well, ensuring that all commune members eat well, sleep well, and rest well. We will rectify and consolidate the people's communes, improve operation and management, promote management democratization, and make all commune members feel happy and more motivated. On the cultural, educational, and health fronts, we will continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and sports activities to ensure that the people are healthy and energetic. We will continue to carry out the literacy campaign, develop education, further carry out scientific research, and improve the cultural level and cultural life of the farmers.

We will resolutely follow the instructions of the Party, continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, always maintain high morale and soaring energy, and combine it with a scientific spirit. We will never be arrogant and complacent because of our achievements. We know that the existing achievements are still far from the great ideal of building a highly developed modern socialist agriculture and the landscaping of the land proposed by Chairman Mao. We must always remember Chairman Mao's instruction: "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind," always maintain a humble and prudent attitude, promote the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts, resolutely guard against exaggeration, and diligently do our work more, better, more meticulously, and more practically. We will always maintain the advanced honor of our units, help other units to progress, and consolidate and strengthen our close relationship with the masses. Under the leadership of the Party, we will strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural socialist construction in 1959! We will strive to build a modern socialist new countryside!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live our beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议
    向党中央和毛主席致敬电敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的全体代表，带来了全国五亿农民的心意，谨向我们敬爱的党中央和毛主席，致以最崇高最诚挚的敬礼！
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年我国的农业生产取得了伟大的历史性的胜利，农、林、牧、副、渔各个方面都获得空前大丰收，提前九年实现了全国农业发展纲要所规定的粮棉增产指标，创造了古今中外所未有的奇迹。在农业生产大跃进的基础上，全国农村在很短期间内实现了人民公社化，使我国的农业进入了一个新的历史时期。在生产大跃进的同时，全国各地以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，也有了跃进的发展。我们的生活也有了进一步的改善，今后还要得到更大的改善。
    我们深深知道，所有这一切都是在党和毛主席的领导下得到的。在这次会议上，我们认真地学习了党的八届六中全会会议公报和关于人民公社若干问题的决议，并且听了刘少奇同志代表党中央给我们作的亲切的指示，我们听了周总理和各位负责同志的报告，我们代表全国农民，向党和毛主席保证，一定要遵循党的指示，同全国人民一道，努力实现党的决议。
    我们向全国各地农村人民公社和全体农民兄弟姊妹提出了十大倡议。本着中央指示的工业农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，保证完成和力争超过1959年粮食、棉花的生产任务。保证油料作物、麻类、糖料、烟叶、丝、茶和其他各种工业原料作物都完成和超额完成国家所规定的增产指标。一定要切实做好当前的过冬作物的田间管理和春播作物的备耕工作。认真执行农业增产的“八字宪法”。开展大面积高产田运动。全面发展农林牧副渔生产，更多更好地供应城市需要的副食品。并且要根据条件大办工业。我们一定逐步实现农林牧副渔五业中的全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。
    在发展生产的同时，我们还要办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院，保证全体社员吃好、睡好、休息好。整顿和巩固人民公社，搞好经营管理，发扬管理民主化，使社员人人心情舒畅，干劲更足。在文教卫生战线上，要继续开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动和体育活动，使人民身体健康，精神充沛。继续开展扫盲运动，发展教育，进一步开展科学研究工作，提高农民的文化水平和文化生活。
    我们坚决按照党的指示，继续反对右倾保守思想，永远保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲，并和科学精神结合起来。我们决不因为工作有了成绩就骄傲自满。我们知道已有的成绩距离建设高度发展的现代化的社会主义农业和毛主席提出的大地园林化的伟大理想，还差的很远。我们要永远记住毛主席的指示：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，永远保持谦虚谨慎的态度，发扬群众路线和实事求是的作风，力戒浮夸，勤勤恳恳地把工作做的更多、更好、更细致、更踏实，永远保持自己单位的先进荣誉，并帮助其他单位进步，巩固和加强同群众的密切关系。在党的领导下，为实现1959年农业社会主义建设更大更好更全面地跃进而奋斗！为建设现代化的社会主义的新农村而奋斗！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的党中央和毛主席万岁！
