Zunyi City is the second largest city in Guizhou and a glorious city in the history of the people's revolution.

On January 8, 1935, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau here. This meeting was the "Zunyi Conference," a turning point in revolutionary history.

On January 8, 1959, it was exactly the twenty-fourth anniversary of the "Zunyi Conference." On January 6, twenty-four years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De led the First Front Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army into Zunyi City after the battle of crossing the Wujiang River. When the Red Army entered the city, the people of Zunyi spread the news: "They're here! They're here!" The people of Zunyi, who had been suffering for so long, finally awaited the Red Army. The Red Army stayed here for more than ten days, sowing the seeds of revolution and strengthening the people's confidence in victory. The revolutionary people believed that the Red Army would definitely return.

In November 1949, the People's Liberation Army liberated Zunyi. The people's own army, which the revolutionary people had always looked forward to, had truly "returned!" They donated the revolutionary historical relics they had preserved at the risk of their lives. In the "Zunyi Conference" Memorial Hall, one can see the "Ten Programs" issued by the Red Army at that time, the "Political Department Notice," the "Letter to Poor Peasants," as well as banknotes issued by the "Chinese Soviet Republic Bank," and the Red Army's weapons - rifles, grenades, and so on. These revolutionary historical relics preserved by the revolutionary people confirmed the revolutionary people's firm belief in the inevitable victory of the people's revolution.

Zunyi, in the dark years of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, was truly "done for," with the people living in dire poverty. In the nine years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Zunyi have undergone a series of movements such as suppressing bandits and eliminating local despots, land reform, democratic reform, and production reform, as well as the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the socialist revolution of agricultural collectivization, and have been striding onto the "happy bridge" of the people's commune leading to communism since the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958. The old "Ximatang" head is now towering with the buildings of the Zunyi Health School; the old "Lazy Bench" has become a prosperous town. Today's Nanbai People's Commune is formed here at "Lazy Bench."

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the population of Zunyi city, which originally had more than 100,000 people, suddenly increased to more than 200,000; the industrial output value increased sharply from just over 9% of the total industrial and agricultural output value to more than 30%.

The people of Zunyi are working hard, "striving for the steel capital of tomorrow - Zunyi!" At the time of liberation, there were only three dilapidated factories run by bureaucratic capital: a distillery, a match factory, and a flour mill. The Zunyi Power Plant, Farm Implements Factory, Manganese Iron Plant, Coal Plant, Pharmaceutical Factory, Brick and Tile Factory, Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, Silk Weaving Factory, etc., were all built by the revolutionary people themselves after liberation. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, on June 10, four factories, steel, alloy, chemical, and refrigeration, started construction at the same time. Ten days later, a high-grade fertilizer factory broke ground. When the million-strong army of the Zunyi Special District fought a great battle for steel, on last year's October 20 "High Yield Day," the 20,000 tons of iron produced by Zunyi accounted for a quarter of the entire district. Standing on the mountain south of the city and looking into the distance, you can see the tall chimneys of the Zunyi Iron and Steel Plant and the iron smelting furnaces competing in height on the ring of the flat dam. Half a year ago, this was still a barren slope and rice paddy, but at this time, the victory of the 90,000 people of Zunyi in battle has changed its face. One of Guizhou's five iron and steel joint industries will "race steel water with the Wujiang River" in the bright spring season this year.

Heading south from the iron and steel joint industrial base, looking into the distance at the "basic farmland" of the Dafengbao Production Brigade of the Nanbai People's Commune, you can see the dense green wheat seedlings, thriving and spread out in the rectangular "big flat dam." This is one of the "high-yield dams" of Zunyi's 900,000 mu of "basic farmland"; it is the result of a half-month battle by 4,000 combatants. Deep plowing to a depth of three feet, digging and filling soil, 204 mu and 90 plots of paddy fields were leveled into 219 mu and 6 large flat dam "high-yield fields." Now, the production teams along the big flat dam are responsible for the field management of this "high-yield dam" and have established a "file system." They are busy topdressing, wanting the dense wheat seedlings to grow more vigorously, to realize the Party's call for large-area high-yield harvests.

The people of Zunyi, in the tense labor of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, have also transferred a large number of laborers to support the heroic battle of building the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The 2,100-meter-long tunnel of the perilous Loushan Pass was opened half a year ahead of schedule on June 30, 1958; the road-building army is digging the longer 4,200-meter-long Liangfengya tunnel with the soaring spirit of the Red Army's bloody battle at Loushan Pass. The road-building armies from the north and south will "meet" here. "Building the Sichuan-Guizhou road will bring happiness for ten thousand years," and the people along the route support the road-building army like they supported the Red Army and the People's Liberation Army.

The "Zunyi Conference" twenty-four years ago, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, saved the Chinese revolution at the most critical juncture and opened the glorious page of the great victory of the Chinese revolution. On the anniversary of the "Zunyi Conference" today, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out the road for our country to build socialism and prepare for the gradual transition to communism. The people of Zunyi are determined to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 on this "ten thousand years of happiness" avenue. (Attached picture)

    跃进中的遵义
    若波
    遵义市是贵州第二个大城市，是人民革命历史上的光荣城市。
    1935年1月8日，党中央在这里举行了中央政治局扩大会议。这次会议，就是革命历史转折点的“遵义会议”。
    1959年1月8日，正是“遵义会议”的二十四周年。在二十四年前的1月6日，毛泽东同志、朱德同志领导着中国工农红军第一方面军经过抢渡乌江战役进入了遵义城。红军入城时，遵义人民奔走相告：“来了！来了！”久处在水深火热中的遵义人民，终于盼到了红军。红军在这里住了十多天，撒下了革命火种，坚定了人民的必胜信心。革命的人民相信红军一定会回来的。
    1949年11月，人民解放军解放遵义。革命人民时刻盼念着的自己的军队真的“回来”了！他们把自己冒着生命危险保存下来的革命历史文物捐献了出来。在“遵义会议”纪念馆中，可看到，当年红军散发的“十大政纲”、
  “政治部布告”、“告贫农书”，还有“中华苏维埃共和国银行”印发的钞票、红军作战的武器——步枪、手榴弹，等等。这些为革命人民保存下来的革命历史文物，确证了革命人民坚信人民革命的必胜。
    遵义，在国民党反动统治的黑暗年代里，真是“干”到了山穷水尽，民不聊生。解放九年来，遵义人民在党的领导下，经过了搜山清匪、土地改革、民主改革、生产改革一系列的运动，经过了抗美援朝运动和农业合作化等社会主义革命，一直到1958年工农业大跃进，已经迈登上人民公社这座走向共产主义的“幸福天桥”。昔日的“洗马滩”头，高矗着遵义卫生学校的楼房；昔日的“懒板凳”上，成了繁荣的市镇。今天的南白人民公社，就在“懒板凳”这里组成。
    1958年大跃进，原来十多万人口的遵义城区突增到二十多万人；工业产值从只占工农业总产值的9％多突增到30％以上。
    遵义人民正在鼓足冲天干劲，“为明日的钢都——遵义而奋斗！”这里在解放当时，只有官僚资本经营的三个破烂工厂：酒精厂、火柴厂和面粉厂。遵义电厂、农具厂、锰铁厂、煤厂、药厂、砖瓦厂、磷肥厂、丝织厂等等，都是革命的人民在解放后亲手兴建的。1958年大跃进，在6月10日这一天，同时动工的，就有钢铁、合金、化工、冷冻四个厂。过了十天，又有高级化肥厂破土兴工。当遵义专区百万大军大战钢铁的时候，在去年10月20日“高产日”中，遵义所产二万吨铁占全区的四分之一。在城南登山遥望，就可以看到遵义钢铁厂的高大烟囱同化铁炉在环山的平坝里比高。这里，半年前还是荒坡和田畦，而这时，遵义九万人民作战的胜利，已经改变了它的面貌。贵州五个钢铁联合工业之一，就将在今年春光明媚时节“钢水同乌江赛跑”了。
    从钢铁联合工业基地南行，遥望南白人民公社大风暴生产大队的“基本农田”，只见茂密的绿油油的麦苗，茁壮地铺在条方形的“大平坝”里。这是遵义九十万亩“基本农田”的“丰产坝”之一；是四千战斗员鏖战半月的战果。深翻三尺、挖填土，二百零四亩、九十块畦田，平整成二百一十九亩、六块大平坝“丰产田”。现在，沿着大平坝的生产队，担负了这块
  “丰产坝”的田间管理，建立了“档案制”。他们正在紧张追肥，要叫茂密的麦苗生长得更加茁壮，来实现党的大面积高产丰收的号召。
    遵义人民，在工农业同时并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的紧张劳动里，还抽调了大批劳力，支援修建川黔铁路的英勇战斗。天险娄山关二千一百多公尺的大隧道，早在1958年6月30日提前半年打通；更长的四千二百多公尺的凉风垭大隧道，筑路大军正在用红军血战娄山关的冲天干劲开凿。南北两路筑路大军将在这里“会师”。“修通川黔路，幸福万万年”，沿线人民像支援红军、支援解放军一样地支援着筑路大军。
    二十四年前的“遵义会议”，在毛泽东同志领导下，在最危急的关头挽救了中国革命，揭开了中国革命取得伟大胜利的光辉史页。在“遵义会议”二十四周年纪念日的今天，在毛泽东同志领导下，党的八届六中全会指明了我国建成社会主义、并为逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件的道路。遵义人民决心在这条“万年幸福”的大道上，争取1959年更大更好更全面地跃进。（附图片）
