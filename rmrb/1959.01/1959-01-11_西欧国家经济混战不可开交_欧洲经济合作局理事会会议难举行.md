Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th dispatch: A spokesman for the European Economic Cooperation Bureau announced on the 9th that the European Economic Cooperation Bureau Council meeting, originally scheduled for January 15th, would be postponed. The spokesman did not announce when the postponement would be.

This meeting was decided upon at the European Economic Cooperation Bureau Council meeting held in Paris on December 15th of last year. At that meeting, the "Common Market" group of six Western European nations and the Western European nations not belonging to this group fell out with each other. The latter, represented by Britain, feared that the establishment of the "Common Market" would put them at a disadvantage when competing in this market, and therefore demanded that the "Common Market" not "discriminate" against other countries; while the "Common Market" group insisted that there must be special trade terms that only apply to each other. The fierce dispute almost completely broke down the meeting. Merely in consideration of the fact that these countries still needed to maintain a facade of "unity" before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, the meeting was finally decided to be postponed to January 15th of this year to continue, and the permanent representatives of the seventeen countries participating in the European Economic Cooperation Bureau were instructed to conduct "preparations" for this meeting during this period.

According to the spokesman of the European Economic Cooperation Bureau, the "preparatory work" of these permanent representatives has not yet progressed to "a degree sufficient to make it advantageous to convene a ministerial meeting on January 15th."

Currently, the point of contention between the two sides lies in: Britain still insists on a proposal it made at the December 15th meeting: "Common Market" member states must extend a special clause they implement among themselves—allowing to increase the import quota of certain products (including automobiles) to 3% of the domestic production of similar items—to non-"Common Market" countries. However, "Common Market" member states believe that accepting Britain's demands would be tantamount to "drowning" the "Common Market," and therefore refuse to agree. France, in particular, has openly come forward to oppose Britain's demands. France recently announced that it has relaxed its import quotas for European Economic Cooperation Bureau countries by 90%. It is said that this makes France more justified in rejecting Britain's demands.

France's attitude naturally aroused dissatisfaction in Britain. The British "Financial Times" complained that France's so-called 90% relaxation of import quotas is based on the 1948 quotas, and at that time many things were completely prohibited from import; moreover, the goods for which import quotas are currently relaxed do not include items such as automobiles, many types of tractors, and machine tools, which are very important for British exports. On the other hand, the "3% clause" that only applies within the "Common Market" still creates "serious discrimination" against countries outside the Common Market. This newspaper, speaking for British capitalists, emphasized that "discrimination" is something Britain can never accept, because it means that "the free trade zone is doomed."

### 西欧国家经济混战不可开交  欧洲经济合作局理事会会议难举行

    西欧国家经济混战不可开交
    欧洲经济合作局理事会会议难举行
    新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：欧洲经济合作局的一个发言人9日宣布，原定在1月15日举行的欧洲经济合作局理事会会议将延期举行。至于延期到什么时候，这个发言人并没有宣布。
    这次会议是去年12月15日在巴黎举行的欧洲经济合作局理事会会议决定要举行的。在那次会议上，西欧六国“共同市场”集团和不属这个集团的西欧国家吵翻了脸。以英国为代表的后者害怕“共同市场”的成立会使它们在这个市场中竞争时处于劣势地位，因此要求“共同市场”不得“歧视”其他国家；而“共同市场”集团则坚持说，必须有只适用于它们彼此之间的特殊贸易条款。剧烈的争吵使得会议几乎完全破裂。仅仅是为了考虑到在北大西洋集团理事会会议前夕这些国家还需要维持一个“团结”的门面，会议最后才决定延期到今年1月15日继续举行，并且责成参加欧洲经济合作局的十七国的常驻代表在此期间为这次会议进行“准备”。
    据欧洲经济合作局的发言人说，这些常驻代表们的“准备工作”直到现在还没有进行到“足以使在1月15日召开一次部长级会议成为有利的程度”。
    目前，双方争执之点在于：英国仍然坚持它在12月15日会议上提出的一项建议：“共同市场”成员国必须把它们彼此之间实行的一项特殊条款——可以把某些产品（其中包括汽车）的进口额提高到占本国同类物品产量的3％——扩大到非“共同市场”国家。但是，“共同市场”成员国认为，接受英国的要求就等于“淹死”“共同市场”，因此不肯同意。特别是法国公开出面反对英国的要求。法国在不久以前宣布把它对欧洲经济合作局国家的进口限额放宽90％，有消息说，这样法国在拒绝英国的要求的时候，就更加振振有词了。
    法国的这种态度自然引起了英国的不满。英国的“金融时报”抱怨说，法国的所谓放宽进口限额90％是以1948年的限额作为基础的，而当时有很多东西是根本禁止进口的；何况目前进口限额予以放宽的货物中并不包括像汽车、许多种类的拖拉机和工作母机等对英国的出口十分重要的东西。而另一方面，仅仅适用于“共同市场”内部的“百分之三条款”则仍然造成了对于共同市场以外的国家的“严重歧视”。代表英国资本家说话的这家报纸强调说，“歧视”是英国绝不能接受的，因为这意味着“自由贸易区注定要倒楣”。
