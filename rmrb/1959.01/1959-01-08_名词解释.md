Glossary of Terms

    Cosmic Television: In television broadcasting and microwave radio communications, extremely short radio waves are used, called ultra-short waves. These ultra-short waves are different from ordinary radio short waves. Ordinary radio waves rely on reflection from the ionosphere and are not affected by ground obstacles; however, ultra-short waves cannot rely on reflection from the ionosphere and can only propagate within the line of sight. Therefore, to increase the distance of television broadcasting or microwave radio communications, two methods are usually adopted: one method is to install the transmitting antenna as high as possible; the other method is to establish radio communication relay stations. However, relying on these two methods, it is also difficult to achieve a situation where one broadcast television can be received globally. If we set up this relay station on artificial satellites or the moon, and use the reflection of artificial clouds (sodium clouds, artificial comets) formed by cosmic rockets, we can solve the problem of broadcasting television in one place being visible globally.
    Mars Opposition: When the Earth travels between the Sun and an outer planet (i.e., planets farther from the Sun than Earth: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto), that is, when the Sun, Earth, and a certain outer planet are on a straight line, it is called the opposition of the outer planet.
    Since the orbits of planets and the Earth are not perfectly circular, the distance between the outer planet and the Earth is different when opposition occurs. If we encounter the closest "opposition," it is called the Great Opposition, to distinguish it from ordinary opposition. Mars Great Opposition is the opposition of Mars that occurs at its perihelion. At this time, Mars is only 55 million kilometers away from Earth. If the opposition of Mars occurs near the aphelion, the distance from Earth is as far as 100 million kilometers. Mars Great Opposition occurs every fifteen or seventeen years, and always between July and September. For example, a Mars Great Opposition occurred on September 10, 1956, and the next Mars Great Opposition will occur in August 1971.
    Ion: When molecules and atoms, the basic components of matter, carry an electrical charge, they are called ions.
    Ion Engine, Ion Rocket: Ions can release heat when combined. It is possible to use this heat as the energy source of an engine to create an ion engine. Since there are a large number of ions in the ionosphere and the space above it, as well as in interplanetary and interstellar space, if they can be used to propel the engine of a cosmic rocket, then the rocket can be given new kinetic energy in addition to its original kinetic energy, finding an inexhaustible new energy source for the rocket. This future ideal rocket is called an ion rocket.
    Weightlessness: There is attraction between any objects in the universe. The Earth's attraction to everything around us is called the Earth's gravity. When a person rides a spaceship away from the Earth and flies towards the universe, they are free from the Earth's attraction and lose weight. At this time, a person in the spaceship can float lightly with just a slight jump, and many other strange phenomena will occur. This situation is called weightlessness.

    名词解释
    宇宙电视：在电视广播和微波无线电通讯方面，都应用着波长极短的无线电波，叫做超短波。这种超短波和普通的无线电短波不同。普通的无线电波依靠电离层反射，不受地面障碍物的影响；而超短波不能依靠电离层的反射，只能在视线所及的范围之内传播。因此为了增加电视广播或者微波无线电通讯的距离，通常只能采取两种办法：一种办法是发射天线尽可能安得高些；一种办法是设立无线电通讯转播站。但是，依靠这两种办法也很难作到一处广播电视，全球都能收到。如果我们把这种转播站设在人造卫星上或者月球上，以及利用宇宙火箭形成的人造云（钠云、人造彗星）的反射，就能解决一处广播电视全球都可看到的问题了。
    火星大冲：当地球运行到外行星（即离开太阳比地球远的行星：火星、木星、土星、天王星、海王星、冥王星都是）和太阳之间，也就是当太阳、地球和某个外行星碰在一条线上的时候，就叫做外行星的冲日。
    由于行星和地球的轨道都不是正圆的，因此，遇到冲日时，外行星和地球之间的距离也就不同。如果碰到距离最近的“冲日”，就叫大冲，以别于一般的冲。火星大冲就是火星在近日点发生的冲日，这时火星离开地球只有五千五百万公里，如果火星的冲日发生在远日点附近，和地球的距离就达一万万公里了。火星大冲每隔十五年或者十七年发生一次，而且总在7月到9月之间，例如1956年9月10日发生过火星大冲，下一次火星大冲将在1971年8月间发生。
    离子：物质的基本组成部分——分子和原子带有电荷时称为离子。
    离子发动机，离子火箭：离子结合时能发出热量，可以设法利用这种热量来作为发动机的能源，制造出离子发动机，由于在电离层及更上层的空间以及行星际空间和星际空间有大量离子的存在，所以如果能利用它们来推动宇宙火箭的发动机，那么就可以使火箭除了原有的运动能量外再加上新的运动能量，为火箭找到无穷尽的新能源，这种未来理想的火箭称为离子火箭。
    失重：宇宙间任何物体之间都有吸引力，地球对于我们周围的一切物体的吸引力称为地心引力。当人乘着宇宙飞船离开地球向着宇宙飞行时，就摆脱了地球的吸引力，失去了重量，这时，人在宇宙飞船中只要稍微跳一跳，就能轻飘飘地飞起来，并且还会发生其他许多奇怪的现象，这种情况称为失重。
