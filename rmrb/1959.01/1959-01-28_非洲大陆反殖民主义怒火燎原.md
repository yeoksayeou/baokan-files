A comprehensive report from our newspaper: On January 4th, the roar of the Congolese people opened a new chapter in the African national independence movement in 1959. From Algiers to the Cape of Good Hope, from Dakar to the Gulf of Aden, the flames of struggle are raging everywhere. Millions of oppressed African people are holding high the banner of "Immediate Independence" and "Colonialists Get Out of Africa," advancing bravely.

	Rhodesian and Nyasaland Masses Rally
	Demanding an Immediate End to British Colonial Rule

In Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the struggle of the Congolese people resonated widely. Salisbury, the industrial center of Southern Rhodesia, held a mass rally on January 18th to support the struggle of the Congolese people. Cheekelema, Vice Chairman of the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, said at the rally that the situation in Southern Rhodesia was similar to that in the Belgian Congo, and if a violent revolution occurred in Central Africa, it would start in Southern Rhodesia first. The mass rally also passed a resolution protesting against the persecution of Rhodesian national independence movement leaders by the British colonial authorities. A mass rally of 2,000 people was held in Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, demanding an immediate end to British colonial rule.

On January 20th, Nyasaland held mass rallies and demonstrations against colonial rule. Because the police suppressed the demonstrators, the marching masses attacked the police station and government office buildings with stones. Forty people were arrested by the colonial authorities, thirty-six of whom were women.

	Tanganyika People Demand Independence This Year
	Buganda Parliament Resolves Not to Be a "Protectorate"

In East Africa, on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, voices against colonial rule are also constantly being heard.

The people of the British "Trust Territory" of Tanganyika have issued an ultimatum to the Queen of England and the Governor of Tanganyika, stating that if they are not granted independence in 1959, they will resolutely resist. Bibi Titi Mohammed, leader of the Tanganyika Women's Organization, which has 100,000 members, said on January 20th that the people of Tanganyika are prepared to endure any hardship to achieve this goal.

In the British "Protectorate" of Buganda, although the colonial authorities have been forced to agree to hold elections for members of the "Legislative Council" this year, directly electing all thirty members (previously only eighteen), this has not quelled the anger of the people of Buganda. The Buganda Legislative Council recently passed a resolution demanding a swift end to the status of a British "Protectorate."

	Resistance Appears in Portuguese Mozambique
	Leaflets Criticizing Colonial Authorities Distributed

Recently, in Mozambique, under Portuguese terrorist rule, leaflets criticizing various colonial policies of the colonial authorities have been distributed. The Portuguese colonial authorities are greatly alarmed. Large numbers of police are conducting searches and arrests everywhere. The number of those arrested has reached fifty.

	Cameroon People's Armed Struggle Continues to Develop
	Togo Situation Alarms French Authorities

In West Africa, the people of Cameroon continue to wage a fierce armed struggle against the French colonialists. In a recent battle, twelve French invaders were killed and more than ten were wounded. The French army is very frightened. French motorized patrols randomly shoot at pedestrians on various highways. On January 6th, the West German "Die Welt" admitted that the French colonialists, "despite taking strong measures," Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, is still under the influence of nationalist forces.

In Togo, another French "Trust Territory," the national independence movement has also recently developed vigorously. According to French newspapers, after the outbreak of the Congolese people's struggle, French motorized troops were dispatched from Cotonou (the capital of Dahomey), crossed the border, and headed to Lomé, the capital of Togo. A large number of French troops concentrated in Dahomey are in a state of combat readiness. France has also sent reinforcements from Dakar, French West Africa, by military transport aircraft to Cotonou. French newspapers said that these troops are also going to Togo to fight.

	Strengthen West African Workers' Unity in Struggle
	General Union of Black African Workers Announced

The establishment of the General Union of Black African Workers is a major event in the workers' movement and national independence movement in West Africa recently. This organization was decided upon at the first congress of the General Union of Black African Workers held in Konakry, West Africa, in mid-January. The General Union of Black African Workers has determined its struggle goal as: to unite all African workers in one trade union movement to safeguard the material and spiritual interests of all members, and to guide and coordinate the struggle of African trade union organizations against colonialism and various forms of exploitation.

	New Turn in Algeria's Military Situation
	National Liberation Army Breaks Through French Morice Line

While the anti-colonial struggle in the above-mentioned regions of Africa is surging, the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army has broken through the French so-called "Morice Line," achieving a great victory.

The Morice Line extends from the Tunisian border in the east to the Moroccan border in the west. The French colonial army has deployed ten divisions of troops along this defense line, setting up radar, fortresses, artillery positions, and an electric grid one kilometer deep, in an attempt to block the connection between the Algerian National Liberation Army and the outside world.

The breakthrough of the "Morice Line," as pointed out by the "Voice of the Algerian Republic" radio station, is a great victory for the National Liberation Army. This allows a large number of members and equipment to be transported into Algeria to replenish and strengthen the various units of the National Liberation Army. Therefore, "This means the complete failure of the French blockade policy, the further weakening of the French military strength; it also marks a turning point in the Algerian military situation."

### 非洲大陆反殖民主义怒火燎原

    非洲大陆反殖民主义怒火燎原
    本报综合报道　1月4日，刚果人民的一声怒吼，揭开了1959年非洲民族独立运动的新的一页。从阿尔及尔到好望角，从达喀尔到亚丁湾，到处燃烧起了熊熊的斗争烈火。千百万饱受压迫的非洲人民，高举起“立即独立”、“殖民者滚出非洲”的大旗，奋勇前进。
    罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰群众集会
    要求立即结束英国的殖民统治
    在罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰，刚果人民的斗争引起了广泛的共鸣。南罗得西亚的工业中心索耳兹伯里在1月18日举行了群众大会，支持刚果人民的斗争。南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会副主席契克雷马在大会上说，南罗得西亚的情况跟比属刚果的情况相似，如果中非发生暴力革命，首先将从南罗得西亚开始。群众大会并且作出决议，抗议英国殖民当局迫害罗得西亚的民族独立运动领袖。北罗得西亚的卢萨喀城曾经举行了有二千人参加的群众大会，要求立即结束英国人的殖民统治。
    尼亚萨兰在1月20日举行了反对殖民统治的群众集会和游行。由于警察进行镇压，游行群众用石块袭击了警察局和政府办公楼。四十人遭到了殖民当局逮捕，其中三十六人是妇女。
    坦噶尼喀人民要求在今年独立
    布干达议会决议不当“保护国”
    在印度洋西岸的东非地区，也不断传出了反对殖民统治的呼声。
    英国“托管地”坦噶尼喀人民向英国女王和坦噶尼喀总督提出了最后通牒，表示如果不让他们在1959年取得独立，他们将进行坚决的反抗。拥有十万会员的坦噶尼喀妇女组织领袖比比·蒂蒂·穆罕默德在1月20日说，坦噶尼喀人民准备忍受任何艰辛来达到这一目标。
    在英国的“保护国”布干达，殖民当局虽然被迫同意要在今年举行“立法会议”议员选举，直接选出全体议员三十名（过去仅十八人），但这并不能平熄布干达人民的怒火。布干达立法议会最近通过了一项决议，要求迅速结束英国“保护国”的地位。
    葡属莫三鼻给出现反抗行动
    有人散发抨击殖民当局传单
    最近在葡萄牙恐怖统治下的莫三鼻给有人散发抨击殖民当局各项殖民政策的传单。葡萄牙殖民当局大为恐慌。大批警察到处进行搜索和逮捕。被捕者已达五十人。
    喀麦隆人民武装斗争继续发展
    多哥局势使法国当局惊慌失措
    在西非地区，喀麦隆人民继续进行激烈的反对法国殖民者的武装斗争。在最近一次的战斗中，法国侵略者有十二人被击毙，十余人被击伤，法国军队十分恐慌。法国摩托化巡逻队在各个公路上随便向行人开枪。1月6日西德的“世界报”承认，法国殖民者“尽管采取了有力的措施”，但是喀麦隆的首都雅温得仍然处于民族主义势力影响之下。
    在法国另一个“托管地”多哥，民族独立运动最近也有了蓬勃发展。据法国报纸报道，在刚果人民的斗争爆发后，法国摩托化部队即由科托努（达荷美的首府）出动，越过边境，开往多哥的首府洛美。集中在达荷美的法国大批兵力，处于备战状态。法国还派遣一批增援部队从法属西非的达喀尔乘军用运输机开往科托努。法国报纸说，这批部队也是到多哥去作战的。
    加强西非工人在斗争中的团结
    黑非洲工人总联合会宣布成立
    黑非洲工人总联合会的成立是最近西非地区工人运动和民族独立运动的重大事件。这个组织，是1月中旬在西非科纳克召开的黑非洲工人总联合会第一次代表大会决定成立的。黑非洲工人总联合会确定自己的斗争目标是：把所有非洲工人团结在一个工会运动里，以维护所有成员的物质和精神利益，指导和协调非洲各工会组织进行反对殖民制度和各种剥削形式的斗争。
    阿尔及利亚军事形势出现新转折
    民族解放军突破法国莫里斯防线
    正在非洲上述地区反殖民主义斗争风起云涌之际，英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军突破了法国的所谓“莫里斯防线”，取得了一次巨大的胜利。
    莫里斯防线东起突尼斯边境，西至摩洛哥边境。法国殖民军在这条防线的沿线布置了十个师的军队，设置雷达、堡垒、炮兵阵地和纵深达一公里的电网，企图封锁阿尔及利亚民族解放军和外界的联系。
    “莫里斯防线”的被突破，正如“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台指出的，是民族解放军的巨大胜利。这使得大量成员和装备可以运入阿尔及利亚，以补充和壮大民族解放军各部队。因此，“这意味着法国封锁政策的全面失败，意味着法军战斗力量的进一步削弱；这也标志着阿尔及利亚军事形势的一个转折。”（附图片）
