Train Rural Nursery Staff Quickly
Yi Qing

With the establishment of people's communes, nurseries and kindergartens have been widely established in various places. The task of childcare has suddenly shifted from thousands of families to the nursery staff of nurseries and kindergartens. Nursery staff must not only bear the responsibility of raising children like parents but also bear the responsibility of educating children like teachers. This is a glorious cause, but also an arduous task. To run nurseries and kindergartens well, the most important thing is to ensure the quantity and quality of nursery staff. Since the establishment of communes in various places, due to the mobilization of all positive factors and the unified allocation of manpower, the number of nursery staff is still not enough, but the issue of quality is even more important. Therefore, after the establishment of nurseries and kindergartens in various places, a common requirement has been put forward, that is, to universally train nursery staff and improve their political and ideological and professional level. Some places have already begun to carry out this work. This is a very important measure.

At present, those working in rural nurseries and kindergartens are probably no more than two groups of people: one group is young unmarried girls, most of whom are commendable for their enthusiasm, but lack experience in managing and educating children. They often cannot take care of children's cold, heat, hunger, and fullness very thoughtfully, and they do not know how to educate children. The other group is older rural women, who, although they have experience in managing and educating children, also have no experience in how to manage and educate so many children well. Among them, some people have an unclear understanding of the great significance of childcare work and are not content with doing childcare work. After children are concentrated in nurseries and kindergartens, there are many benefits for parents to participate in labor production, but some new difficulties have also arisen. For example, how to pay attention to the health of dozens or hundreds of children gathered together, and how to nurse and isolate them once they get sick, is a new problem that should be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, which parent does not want their children to eat well, sleep well, play well, and even receive a good education? One can imagine: if a commune member hears that their child has caught a cold, become ill, or developed bad habits while working or resting, what will happen? It will affect their peace of mind in production and good rest. Therefore, improving the level of nursery staff through training and allowing them to work better is not only directly related to the improvement and consolidation of nurseries and kindergartens but also related to the labor production of commune members and the consolidation and improvement of communes.

Training for nursery staff should be both substantial and realistic, with the virtual leading the real, and combining the virtual and the real. First of all, strengthen political and ideological education to improve their awareness, so that those who believe that "being a nursery worker has no future" will slowly realize that educating and raising children well and enabling the next generation to grow up healthy in body and mind is a noble, glorious, and promising career, thereby settling down and actively engaging in this work. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out training in professional knowledge, which should focus on children's hygiene, health care knowledge, and training in children's education methods.

In terms of training methods, various methods can be adopted according to the specific circumstances of each place, such as running preschool normal schools, mobilizing primary school teachers to be responsible for tutoring, and running short-term training for nursery staff. Regardless of which method, it must be combined with theory and practice, that is, teaching, learning, and doing at the same time, so that the time is short and the results are quick. When Tianjin suburban area of Hebei Province trained nursery staff, it taught the importance of childcare work and basic knowledge, and at the same time, allowed the nursery staff to visit and intern on the spot. In just a few days, they gained a lot from ideology to business. Some nursery staff who originally thought "I would rather be a pig head (i.e., a breeder) than a child head" became content with being a nursery staff after training; an educator who originally couldn't sing a song has learned more than 20 children's songs after training. At present, they have returned to their jobs, full of confidence to do this work well.

The Party committees in various places must quickly grasp the work of training rural nursery staff. Doing a good job in nurseries and kindergartens is closely inseparable from doing a good job in people's communes.

    赶快训练农村保育员
    怡清
    随着人民公社的建立，各地普遍建立了托儿所、幼儿园。保育幼儿的任务一下子由成千成百的家庭，大部分移到托儿所、幼儿园的保育员身上了。保育员既要担负像父母那样抚育子女的责任，又要担负像教员那样教育孩子的责任。这是一个光荣的事业，可也是一个艰巨的任务。要把托儿所、幼儿园办好，最主要的一点，就是保证保育员的数量和质量。各地办起公社以后，由于调动了一切积极因素，统一调配人力，保育员的数量虽然也不是很够，但是，质量问题更是重要。因此，各地在托儿所、幼儿园成立以后，提出一个共同的要求，即普遍训练保育员，提高他们的政治思想和业务水平。有些地方已经开始进行这项工作。这是非常重要的措施。
    现在，在农村托儿所、幼儿园里工作的，大概不外两部分人：一部分是没有结过婚的年轻的姑娘，他们大部分热情可嘉，但是缺少管理教育孩子的经验，对于孩子的冷、热、饿、饱，常常不能照顾体贴得很周到，也不知道怎样对孩子进行教育。另一部分是年龄稍大些的农村妇女，他们虽然有管理、教育孩子的经验，但是怎样管好、教好这样多的孩子，也同样没有经验。在他们中间，还有一部分人对保育工作的重大意义认识不清，不安于做保育工作。孩子集中到托儿所、幼儿园以后，对父母参加劳动生产的好处很多，但也发生了一些新的困难。譬如：几十个、几百个孩子集中在一起，如何注意孩子的健康，一旦生了病，如何护理、隔离，就是一个新的问题，应当尽快解决。再说，哪一个做父母的不希望自己的孩子吃好、睡好、玩好，以至受到好的教育呢？可以设想一下：如果一个社员在生产或者休息的时候，听说自己的孩子着了凉，生了病或者染上坏习惯，将会怎样呢？将会影响他安心生产和很好地休息。所以，通过训练提高保育人员的水平，让他们工作得更好，不仅仅直接关系到托儿所、幼儿园的提高、巩固，还关系到公社社员的劳动生产，关系到公社的巩固和提高。
    对于保育人员进行训练，要有虚有实，以虚带实，虚实结合。首先加强政治思想教育，提高他们的觉悟，让那些认为“当保育员没有前途”的人慢慢认识到：教养好孩子，使下一代身心健康的成长，是崇高的、光荣的很有前途的事业，从而安心、积极地去从事这一工作。同时，还必须进行业务知识的训练，其中要着重儿童卫生、保健知识以及儿童教育方法的训练。
    在训练方法上，可以根据各地具体情况，采取多种多样的办法，如举办幼儿师范学校，发动小学教师负责辅导，开办保育员短期训练等等。不管哪一种方法，都必须做到理论与实际相结合，即边教、边学、边做，这样，时间短，收效快。河北省天津郊区在训练保育员时，一面讲授保育工作的重要性及基础知识，一面让保育员实地参观、实习，在短短的几天中，从思想到业务，收获很大。有些原来认为“宁愿当猪子头（即当饲养员），不愿当孩子头”的保育员，经过训练后，安心当保育员了；原来一个歌也不会唱的教养员，训练后已学会了二十多个幼儿歌曲。目前，他们已经回到工作岗位，满怀信心地做好这一工作。
    关于训练农村保育员的工作，各地党委要赶快抓一下。做好托儿所、幼儿园的工作，同做好人民公社的工作是密切不可分的。
