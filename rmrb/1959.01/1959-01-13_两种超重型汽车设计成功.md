(Xinhua News Agency) Jilin University of Technology's fifth-year students and faculty in the Automotive Department, in collaboration with researchers from the Changchun Automotive Research Institute, have completed the design of two super-heavy automatic unloading vehicles with load capacities of 40 tons and 60 tons, respectively.

The 40-ton and 60-ton super-heavy vehicles are 11 meters long, 4.5 meters wide, and over 3 meters high. Their engines are free-piston gas turbine sets, with horsepower ratings of 500 and 650 respectively. They will soon be handed over to Changchun First Automobile Works and Nanjing Automobile Factory for trial production. Once completed, they will be used in the construction of the Three Gorges water conservancy project.

The design of these large-tonnage super-heavy vehicles concentrates cutting-edge technology and the latest achievements in the automotive industry. For example, the torque required for steering such vehicles is very large, requiring power steering. This design uses a single hydraulic power steering system. In this way, the driver only needs a very small amount of force to steer easily. At the same time, gear shifting and braking are also very convenient.

    两种超重型汽车设计成功
    据新华社讯　吉林工业大学汽车系五年级的师生和长春汽车研究所研究人员协作，完成了载重量分别为四十吨和六十吨的两种超重型自动卸货汽车的设计。
    四十吨和六十吨超载重汽车，车长十一公尺，宽四点五公尺，高三公尺多。它的发动机是自由活塞式燃汽轮机组，马力分别为五百匹和六百五十匹，不久将交由长春第一汽车制造厂和南京汽车制造厂试制，制成后将用于长江三峡的水利工程建设。
    这种大吨位超载重汽车的设计，集中了汽车工业上的尖端技术和最新成就。例如，这种汽车的转向所需的力矩非常大，需要采用动力操纵。这次设计是采用单一液压动力操纵系统。这样驾驶员只需要很小的力量，就能轻便地转向，同时换挡、制动也非常轻便。
