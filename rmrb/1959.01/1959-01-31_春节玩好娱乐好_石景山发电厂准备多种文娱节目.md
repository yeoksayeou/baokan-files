Currently, the factory leadership is arranging Spring Festival production and maintenance work, and organizing recreational programs to ensure that the workers who do not take a vacation can have a good Spring Festival at the factory.

To make the Spring Festival at the factory more meaningful than at home, the factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders are leading the workers in actively preparing for festival recreational activities. During the Spring Festival, they will hold a grand get-together with workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers from the Shijingshan People's Commune. Plant-wide recreational activities include shooting competitions, bicycle races, ball games, chess games, dances, etc. Workshops, sections, and teams will hold small-scale entertainment performances. The staff of the factory's four large canteens are also actively trying to increase the variety of festive food.
