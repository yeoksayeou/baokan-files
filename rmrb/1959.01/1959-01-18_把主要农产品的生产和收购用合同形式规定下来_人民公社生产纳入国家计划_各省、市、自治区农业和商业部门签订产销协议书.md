Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Responsible persons from the agricultural and commercial departments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country signed agreements in Beijing on the 16th regarding the production and sale of agricultural products for 1959 in their respective areas. The signing of these agreements is intended to stipulate the production and procurement plans for major agricultural products in various localities in the form of contracts, to facilitate guiding the rural people's communes in carrying out more planned production, to promote the development of commodity production within the people's communes, and to further incorporate all production activities of the people's communes into the orbit of the planned economy.

These agreements were formulated after consultation between representatives of the agricultural and commercial departments of each province, municipality, and autonomous region. In the future, rural people's communes and grassroots commercial organizations in various localities will also sign specific contracts based on the agreements of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, in order to link the commune's production plans with the state plan. This year, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other materials provided by the state to support agricultural production will also be supplied under contracts signed by commercial and agricultural departments to guarantee supply.

Comrades Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and responsible comrades from the central agricultural and financial and trade departments participated in the signing ceremony. Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin delivered speeches successively. In their speeches, they pointed out that the signing of contracts between agricultural production departments and commercial departments is not a mere formality, but rather a manifestation that, after the rural people's communes are established, socialist economic work must become more meticulous, more accurate, more conducive to the development of production, and must more fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist planned economy. They demanded that the agricultural and commercial departments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions seriously treat the contracts signed this time, and make their utmost efforts to fulfill the tasks stipulated in the contracts, and implement the contract system in the people's communes, in order to realize the provisions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party regarding the establishment of a contract system.

    把主要农产品的生产和收购用合同形式规定下来
    人民公社生产纳入国家计划
    各省、市、自治区农业和商业部门签订产销协议书
    新华社17日讯　全国各省、市、自治区的农业部门和商业部门的负责人，16日在北京分别签订了各地的1959年农产品产销协议书。这些协议书的签订，是为了把各地今年主要农产品的生产、收购计划用合同形式规定下来，便于指导农村人民公社进行更有计划的生产，促进人民公社商品性生产的发展，并且进一步把人民公社的各项生产都纳入计划经济的轨道。
    这些协议书是经过各省、市、自治区农业部门和商业部门的代表协商后制定的。今后各地的农村人民公社和基层商业机构也要根据省、市、自治区的协议，签订具体合同，以便把公社的生产计划和国家计划衔接起来。今年国家支援农业生产的农业机械、化肥、农药等，也将由商业部门和农业部门签订合同，保证供应。
    中共中央书记处书记李先念同志、谭震林同志和中央农业、财贸部门的负责同志都参加了这个签字仪式。李先念和谭震林先后讲了话。他们在讲话中指出，农业生产部门和商业部门签订合同，这不是一种形式，而是表现农村人民公社化后，社会主义的经济工作必须愈作愈细，必须愈来愈准确，必须更有利于生产的发展，必须更充分地发挥社会主义计划经济的优越性。他们要求各省、市、自治区农业部门和商业部门严肃地对待这次签订的合同，并且尽最大努力来完成合同规定的任务，并把合同制贯彻到人民公社，以实现党的八届六中全会关于建立合同制的规定。
