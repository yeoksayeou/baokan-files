Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th – The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of local and municipal Party secretaries on the evening of the 21st to specifically arrange for the immediate launch of a large-scale, vigorous movement to accumulate fertilizer and manage wheat fields throughout the province.

Regarding the launching of the fertilizer accumulation movement, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out at the telephone conference that since last winter, more than 4 trillion jin of fertilizer had been accumulated throughout the province. However, before the wheat harvest, there were plans to apply another 2 trillion jin of topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields (20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu) and 1 trillion jin of base fertilizer to autumn crops (20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu). Thus, the province still needed to accumulate 3 trillion jin of fertilizer. The Provincial Party Committee requested that Party committees at all levels must attach importance to fertilizer accumulation work. Secretaries should take action, every household should be mobilized, and everyone should take part, to widely and deeply launch a movement in which each laborer accumulates 1,000 jin of fertilizer per day. Urban residents, workers, cadres, and students should also participate in fertilizer accumulation, forming a province-wide upsurge in fertilizer accumulation and production. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that Henan Province has extremely broad sources of fertilizer, and it is entirely possible to accumulate 3 trillion jin of fertilizer in 150 days. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, the first priority is to vigorously grasp farmyard manure: (1) universally promote the practice of "people having toilets, pigs having pens, cattle having sheds, sheep having folds, and a hundred ponds for every thousand mu" to collect all human and animal excrement; (2) universally promote composting and heated composting; (3) universally promote smoke fertilization (especially paying attention to smoke fertilization for autumn crops); (4) extensively dig pond mud and river mud; (5) in conjunction with the patriotic health movement, clear dirt from houses, courtyards, and streets; (6) break up old wall soil and kang soil. While accumulating farmyard manure, it is also necessary to vigorously grasp soil fertilizer. It is required that each laborer produce 1,000 jin of soil fertilizer, totaling 25 billion jin throughout the province. Chemical fertilizer plants should also be actively prepared for construction.

According to the Hebei Daily, on January 25, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference attended by the first secretaries of various local committees and other responsible comrades to deploy a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement throughout the province. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to engage in fertilizer accumulation in the same way as in the large-scale iron and steel campaign, to complete and strive to overfulfill the fertilizer accumulation plan, and to ensure the realization of a greater bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year.

At the meeting, Comrade Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke on how to carry out the fertilizer accumulation movement.

He said that in order to ensure the realization of the agricultural production increase target of 60 billion jin of total grain output and 1.8 billion jin of cotton output this year, it is first necessary to strive for a large summer harvest and plant high-yield fields well, which requires full material guarantees. From the current point of view, fertilizer has become a very prominent issue. According to the minimum requirements: 10,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields, 30,000 jin of base fertilizer for spring-sown crops in high-yield fields, 20,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer, and 10,000 jin each of base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer for general fields, the province must have 2.5 trillion jin of coarse fertilizer, which is the annual figure. In order to ensure the need for base fertilizer for spring-sown crops and topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields, 1.5 trillion jin of fertilizer must be accumulated before spring sowing, and 50 billion jin of soil fertilizer must be produced. Without this amount, there is no guarantee for striving for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production. Obtaining so much fertilizer is not easy, and a mass-based, large-scale shock movement must be launched. The Provincial Party Committee believes that from now until spring sowing, it is necessary to focus on the work of accumulating, producing, and delivering fertilizer in the same way as in the large-scale iron and steel production, mobilize cities, villages, communes, government agencies, schools, and troops to organize a fertilizer accumulation army, stipulate quantity, quality, and time requirements, and create a situation of province-wide mobilization, with everyone taking action to accumulate and produce fertilizer.

Comrade Yan Dakai concluded by saying that local and county Party committees all the way down to commune Party committees must establish a fertilizer accumulation and production front. The secretary should take charge and be specifically responsible for leading this work, and it must be grasped deeply and thoroughly and effectively carried out.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 27th – Qinghai Province held a broadcast mobilization meeting on the 23rd to strengthen preparatory plowing and fertilizer accumulation work. Cadres and commune members of various counties and people's communes listened to the mobilization report of Chen Sigong, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the broadcast meeting. Chen Sigong said in his report that the task of increasing grain production this year is very heavy, and the time for spring sowing is also approaching. The Provincial Party Committee requires that a new upsurge of preparatory plowing be launched immediately, centered on fertilizer accumulation and tool reform. Chen Sigong said that fertilizer accumulation must be grasped especially vigorously, ensuring both quantity and quality, and ensuring that organic fertilizer is coordinated with inorganic fertilizer, indigenous and foreign chemical fertilizer is coordinated with farmyard manure, and various fertilizers of different components are mutually coordinated. In addition to applying large amounts of farmyard manure this year, 500 jin of indigenous and foreign chemical fertilizer must be applied to each mu of land. It is required that all people's communes quickly establish and strengthen professional fertilizer accumulation teams, and assign fertilizer accumulation tasks to teams and households, implementing the "three fixed" method of fixing tasks, fixing quality, and fixing rewards, so that professional fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation are well combined. While grasping fertilizer accumulation and production, all communes must also grasp fertilizer delivery, promoting the methods of accumulating fertilizer at the field head, processing it locally, and building pens on the spot. Government agencies, troops, and schools should also quickly join the fertilizer accumulation team. In his report, Chen Sigong also put forward specific requirements for spring plowing preparation work such as tool reform. The cadres and commune members in various places immediately expressed their determination at the broadcast meeting to respond to the call of the Provincial Party Committee with practical actions. Many people's communes discussed and studied specific methods by production team or group that evening.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th – The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference of local and municipal Party committees on the evening of the 22nd, calling on the people of the province to strive to resolutely complete 10 billion dan of high-quality fertilizer.

According to reports from local committees, a massive and magnificent shock fertilizer accumulation movement in which everyone is accumulating fertilizer and fertilizer is accumulated everywhere is rapidly unfolding throughout the province.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, Party organizations at all levels have adopted the two-pronged approach of combining collective fertilizer accumulation with individual fertilizer accumulation and combining fertilizer accumulation with the production of various chemical fertilizers. Some areas have also implemented methods such as assigning tasks according to the number of people, implementing fixed-quota work points for fertilizer accumulation, and rewarding over-fulfillment, and communes purchase fertilizer accumulated by commune members at a price based on quality, thereby greatly increasing the enthusiasm of commune members for accumulating fertilizer. Many people's communes have organized professional fertilizer accumulation teams; some county Party secretaries have carried manure baskets on their backs and taken the lead in collecting manure, so the fertilizer accumulation movement has progressed rapidly and achieved great results.

    狠狠抓  紧紧抓  突击积肥造肥
    河南河北青海山西四省号召全民投入战斗
    据新华社郑州27日电　中共河南省委21日晚召开各地、市委书记参加的电话会议，具体布置在全省范围内立即掀起一个大规模的轰轰烈烈的积肥和麦田管理运动。
    关于开展积肥运动问题，省委在电话会议上指出，从去冬以来，全省已积肥四万多亿斤，但在麦收前还计划再对麦田施追肥二万亿斤（每亩二、三万斤），对大秋地施底肥一万亿斤（每亩二、三万斤），这样，全省还需要积肥三万亿斤。省委要求各地党委必须重视积肥工作。要书记动手，家家动员，人人动手，广泛深入地开展一个每个劳动力日积千斤肥的运动。城市市民、工人、干部、学生也要参加积肥，形成一个全民积肥造肥高潮。省委指出，河南省肥源极广，在一百五十天内积成三万亿斤肥料是完全有可能的。在积肥运动中，首先要大抓农家肥料：（1）普遍推行人有厕所、猪有圈、牛有厩棚、羊有栏和千亩百池的做法，把人畜粪尿全部积起来；（2）普遍推行堆肥和加温堆肥；（3）普遍提倡熏肥（大秋地更要注意熏肥）；（4）大量挖塘泥、河泥；（5）结合爱国卫生运动，清除房、院、街各处污土；（6）破老墙土、炕土。在积农家肥的同时，还要大抓土化肥。要求每个劳力造土化肥一千斤，全省共造二百五十亿斤。化肥厂也要积极筹建。
    据河北日报消息　1月25日，中共河北省委召开有各地委第一书记和其他负责同志参加的电话会议，部署在全省范围内开展大规模的积肥运动。会议强调，要充分发动群众像大搞钢铁一样地大搞积肥，完成并力争超额完成积肥计划，保证实现今年粮棉更大丰收。
    在这次会议上，中共河北省委书记处书记阎达开同志对如何开展积肥运动的问题做了讲话。
    他说，为了保证实现今年粮食总产量六百亿斤、棉花产十八亿斤的农业增产任务，首先争取夏季大丰收，并种好丰产田，这都需要有充分的物质保证。从现在看，肥料已经成为一个十分突出的问题。按最低要求算账：麦田追肥一万斤，春播作物丰产田底肥三万斤，追肥二万斤，一般田底肥、追肥各一万斤，全省就必须有粗肥二万五千亿斤，这是全年数字。为了保证春播作物底肥和麦田追肥的需要，在春播前必须积肥一万五千亿斤，制土化肥五百亿斤。没有这个数，争取农业生产更大丰收就没有保证。拿到这么多的肥料，不是轻而易举的，必须搞起一个群众性的大规模的突击运动。省委认为：从现在起到春播前要和大搞钢铁生产一样，突出的抓积肥造肥送肥工作，发动城市、农村、公社、机关、学校、部队组织一支积肥大军，规定数量、质量、时间要求，造成一个全民动员，大家动手，人人积肥的积肥造肥局面。
    阎达开同志最后说，各地、县委一直到公社党委都要建立一条积肥造肥战线。由书记挂帅，专门负责具体领导这个工作，并且一定要抓深抓透，切实搞好。
    新华社西宁27日电　青海省23日召开加强备耕、积肥工作的广播动员大会。各县、各人民公社的干部和社员收听了中共青海省委书记陈思恭在广播会上的动员报告。陈思恭在报告中说，今年粮食增产的任务很大，春播的时间也快到了。省委要求马上掀起以积肥、工具改革等工作为中心的备耕新高潮。陈思恭说，积肥必须大抓特抓，既要保证数量，又要保证质量，一定要做到有机肥料同无机肥料、土洋化肥与农家肥料、不同成分的各种肥料互相配合。今年除大施农家肥料外，每亩地还要施土、洋化肥五百斤。要求各人民公社迅速建立与加强专业积肥队伍，并把积肥任务分配到队、户，实行定任务、定质量、定奖励的三定办法，使专业积肥同个人积肥很好地结合起来。各公社在抓积肥、造肥同时，还要抓好送肥，推广地头积肥、就地加工和就地边搭圈等办法。机关、部队、学校也要迅速参加到积肥队伍中去。陈思恭在报告中对工具改革等春耕准备工作也提出了具体的要求。各地的干部、社员在广播会上当即表示决心以实际行动响应省委号召。许多人民公社当晚就以生产队或小组为单位讨论、研究了具体的做法。
    新华社太原27日电　中共山西省委在22日晚上召开了各地、市委电话会议，号召全省人民要为坚决完成一百亿担质量好的肥料而奋斗。
    据各地委汇报，一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的人人积肥、处处积肥的突击积肥运动，正在全省迅速展开。
    在积肥运动中，各级党组织采取了集体积肥和个人积肥相结合、积肥与制造各种化学肥料相结合的两条腿走路的办法。有些地区还实行了按人分配任务，实行积肥定额记工，超额奖励等办法，公社按质作价收买社员积的肥料，因而大大提高了社员积肥积极性。许多人民公社都组织了积肥专业队；有的县委书记背起粪筐，带头拾粪，因而积肥运动进展迅速，收效很大。（附图片）
