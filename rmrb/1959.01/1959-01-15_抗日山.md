    Anti-Japanese Mountain
    Shu Chang, Anti-Japanese Mountain Forest Farm Worker

    In western Ganyu County, Jiangsu, there is a famous revolutionary sacred mountain called Anti-Japanese Mountain. The mountain is majestic and imposing, looking like a huge green bell from afar, and shaded by pines and cypresses up close, with very magnificent scenery.

    This mountain was originally called Ma'anshan (Saddle Mountain). The people of Huaihai all know this mountain. Outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation wrote a glorious page in the history of the Anti-Japanese War here with their blood and lives. To commemorate the heroes, the people took the initiative to build this mountain area into a martyrs' cemetery and renamed it Anti-Japanese Mountain. Today, resting here are Political Commissar Fu of the former Binhai Military Region, Chief of Staff Peng Xiong, a hero who crossed the Jinsha River, and the four female heroes who died in the Battle of Xiaoshadong. …

    Every year during the Qingming Festival, local people come in droves to climb the mountain and pay their respects, offering wreaths to the martyrs. Many leading comrades have also specially written inscriptions for the martyrs' tombstones. The first thing you see at the entrance is Marshal Chen Yi's handwritten inscription: "The Noble Spirit Will Endure Forever!"

    Before liberation, this area was desolate, and large tracts of land yielded no crops. The people suffered from hunger and cold, singing mournful songs everywhere: "The grass does not seed, the trees have no bark, nine out of ten families are starving, mothers cook their children's flesh as good food, white bones fill empty bowls with tears of sorrow!" After liberation, the Communist Party helped the people find the natural cause of disaster and poverty: soil erosion and barren land, unable to withstand drought and flood. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, the local people launched a fierce battle against the barren mountains.

    Initially, due to insufficient conditions, only some small ponds and dams were built to partially solve the irrigation of farmland. Until 1956, with the arrival of the high tide of agricultural collectivization across the country, the county established a soil and water conservation station, and a large-scale water management campaign to transform nature and subdue dragons was launched in this area.

    Today, the mountainous area has a completely new look: fish-scale pits have been dug on the mountains, terraces have been built on the mountainsides, and reservoirs of various sizes have been built at the foot of the mountains. Some of the thin land that could only grow low-yielding crops has now been turned into large rice paddies. Looking around, it is green, watery, neat, and swaying in the wind, promising a good harvest. People happily praise the benefits of large-scale water conservancy:

    "Large reservoirs and long ditch embankments, gravity-fed irrigation around the mountain canals, every household engages in water conservancy, and flags of bumper harvest fly everywhere!"

    Speaking of reservoirs, we must mention the "March 8th" Reservoir recently completed at the foot of the mountain. It was built by more than 700 women from all corners and positions in the county. There were young and strong young women, newly married young women, little girls wearing red scarves, and old women with gray hair. At the start of construction, it was August, when the sun was scorching the rocks, and the women's army was organized into battalions, companies, platoons, and squads, appearing on the construction site with the posture and drive of soldiers.

    They sang: "The martyrs shed fresh blood, we sweat profusely, blood and sweat flow together, the reservoir will definitely be realized!"

    In this way, after only thirty days of hard work, a large reservoir with a length of 500 meters, a height of 9 meters, a storage capacity of 250,000 cubic meters, and irrigating 833 mu of land was successfully built. The county water conservancy bureau awarded them a large red cotton flag with the inscription:

    Riding the east wind before Anti-Japanese Mountain,
    Great ambitions surpass Mu Guiying,
    Working hard day and night to create miracles,
    March 8th Reservoir locks the dragon!

  The women's army sang loudly in response:

    Women used to stay at home,
    Now women are the masters,
    Locking the Dragon King and holding the big seal,
    The east wind is triumphant and the reservoir is full of gold!

    Anti-Japanese Mountain is a magnificent mountain, a heroic mountain! It not only defeated the enemy but also conquered nature. It will bloom with the flowers of socialist construction in the place where the heroes sleep peacefully. In the near future, a small mountain on the Shandong side will be rebuilt into Happiness Mountain, with a March 8th orchard opened on the mountain and a Happiness Home built at the foot of the mountain; to the west, an agricultural university and middle school will be built; to the south, 100 mu of land will be designated as a March 8th water conservancy satellite field. In addition, we will also dig a circular mountain canal and connect the Anti-Japanese Mountain Reservoir, Zhuqishan Reservoir, Xushan Reservoir, Honglingjin (Red Scarf) Reservoir, Youth Reservoir, and March 8th Reservoir with trunk canals to form a huge hydropower grid. At present, the Zhuqishan Reservoir power station has been lit. After this hydropower grid is formed, this will be a civilized and hygienic paradise, with electric lights everywhere, flowers and fruits all over the mountains, and evergreen all year round!

    抗日山
    抗日山林场工人　舒畅
    江苏赣榆县西部，有一座著名的革命圣山，名叫抗日山。山势巍峨雄伟，远看仿佛一口巨大的青钟，近看松柏成荫，风景十分壮丽。
    这山原名马鞍山。淮海人民都知道这座山。优秀的中华儿女在这里用热血和生命写下了抗日战争史上的光辉一页。为了纪念英雄，人民动手将这盘山地建成了烈士陵园，并且改名抗日山。如今，安息在这里的有前滨海军区符政委，有当年抢渡天险金沙江的英雄彭雄参谋长，以及在小沙东海战中牺牲的四位女英雄。……
    每年清明时节，当地人民都成群结队地登山凭祭，向烈士们献上花圈。许多领导同志还特地为烈士们撰写了碑文，迎门第一面，便是陈毅元帅的亲笔大书：浩气长存！
    这一带在解放以前，满目凄凉，大片土地颗粒不收。人民饥寒交迫，到处唱着哀歌：“草不打籽树无皮，十家倒有九家饥，娘煮儿肉当好饭，白骨空瓢泪悲啼！”解放后，共产党帮助人民找出了灾难贫困的自然根源是水土流失，土地瘠薄，经不起旱涝。于是，在党的领导下，当地人民便与荒山展开了激烈的搏斗。
    最初，因为条件不足，只是兴修了一些小型塘坝，局部解决农田灌溉。直到1956年，随着全国农业合作化高潮的到来，县里成立了水土保持站，这一带才又展开了一个声势浩大的改天地擒蛟龙的治水运动。
    如今，山区面貌全新了：山上挖了鱼鳞坑，山腰叠梯田，山下修下大小水库。一些原来只能生长低产作物的薄地，现在已经改成大片稻田。展眼望去，绿油油，水汪汪，齐齐整整，迎风摇曳，丰收在望。人们喜滋滋地赞说，这都是大搞水利的好处：
    “大水库来长沟堤，自流灌溉环山渠，家家户户搞水利，遍地招展丰收旗！”
    提起水库，不能不说到新近在山下竣工的“三八”水库。它是全县七百多个妇女建造起来的。她们来自全县各个角落各个岗位，有年轻力壮的大姑娘，有新婚不久的少妇，有带着红领巾的小女孩，也有两鬓苍白的大娘。开工的时候，正是烈日晒得山石烫人的8月时节，妇女大军编成了营、连、排、班，以军人的姿态和干劲出现在工地上。
    她们唱道：“烈士流鲜血，我们出大汗，血汗流一起，水库定实现！”
    就这样，仅仅奋战了三十来天，一座五百公尺长、九公尺高、蓄水二十五万方、灌溉八百三十三亩地的大型水库胜利地修成了。县水利局嘉奖了一面大红绵旗给她们，上书：
    抗日山前乘东风，
    大志远胜穆桂英，
    披星戴月创奇迹，
    三八水库锁蛟龙！
  妇女大军放声歌唱回答道：
    从前妇女不出门，
    如今妇女做主人，
    锁住龙王掌大印，
    东风得意库满金！
    抗日山是壮丽的山，英雄的山！不仅打败了敌寇，也战胜了自然。它将要在英雄们含笑长眠的场所再开满社会主义建设的鲜花。不久的将来，山东边的一座小山将要改建成幸福山，山上开辟三八果园，山下修建幸福院；西边，兴建农业大学、中学；南边划出一百亩土地，作为三八水利卫星田。此外，我们还要开挖一道环山运河，并把抗日山水库、祝其山水库、徐山水库、红领巾水库、青年水库、三八水库用干渠连在一起，组成一个巨大的水力发电网。目前，祝其山水库发电站已经照明了。到这个水力发电网组成以后，这里将是一个文明卫生，处处电灯，满山花果、四季长青的天上人间！
