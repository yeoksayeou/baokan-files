This dispatch from Changsha, January 21st: During the rectification of the commune, the Dongtingwei People's Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, organized manpower to clean up farm tools. They cleaned over 30,000 large and small farm tools, which had been placed outside or scattered in commune members' homes, and concentrated them. Production teams were assigned specific personnel for safekeeping. At the same time, iron, wood, and bamboo workers were organized to go deep into the production teams to repair more than 9,000 large and small farm tools.

Concurrently, they established a "six-fix" method, namely fixed person, fixed location, fixed farm tools, fixed safekeeping system, fixed remuneration, and fixed rewards. They also established farm tool usage contracts, farm tool retrieval procedures, and farm tool inspection systems. After strengthening the farm tool safekeeping responsibility system, many custodians voluntarily moved to live in the farm tool storage rooms. Everyone expressed their determination to properly safeguard the farm tools and ensure that they are readily available for use in spring plowing and production.

    整修大小农具
    本报长沙21日电　湖南省湘阴县洞庭围人民公社在整社中，组织人力清理农具，把放在外面和分散在社员家里的三万多件大小农具、油洗干净，集中起来，以生产小队为单位，确定专人保管。同时，组织铁、木、篾工深入生产小队整修了九千多件大小农具。
    同时，还建立定人、定地点、定农具、定保管制度、定报酬、定奖励的“六定”办法，建立农具使用合同、领取农具手续和农具检查等制度。加强农具保管责任制以后，许多保管员还自动搬到农具保管室去住。大家都表示要把农具保管好，保证春耕生产中随时有农具使用。
