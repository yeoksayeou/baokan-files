Utilizing Local Materials, Comprehensive Utilization, Indigenous Methods
Jiangsu Vigorously Develops the Chemical Industry

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd dispatch) Jiangsu Province is mobilizing the masses to adopt the methods of utilizing local materials and comprehensive utilization, and using indigenous methods to develop the chemical industry. In just a few months, many chemical plants, large and small, have been built throughout the province from cities to villages, and the output of various chemical products has increased rapidly.

Some areas that were originally "blank" in the chemical industry are developing chemical industries from scratch and from small to large. Lianyungang City is located on the coast and has an inexhaustible supply of seawater. It has the crude salt and bittern of the Huaibei Saltworks, and rich phosphate rock at the foot of Jinping Mountain, which are all excellent chemical raw materials. However, in the past, this was a blank spot in Jiangsu Province's chemical industry. Last year, Lianyungang City built more than thirty small chemical plants, and now it can produce basic chemical raw materials such as three acids and two alkalis and more than twenty kinds of chemical products. The output value of the chemical industry has quickly grown to account for about one-third of the city's local industrial output value. Since October of last year, Nanjing City has mobilized the masses to vigorously tackle the "three acids and two alkalis." Lacking ceramic equipment for producing sulfuric acid, they used soy sauce jars and water tanks instead; lacking electrolytic cells, they used toilet cisterns and cement pipes instead. By the end of November, the city had built 252 sulfuric acid towers with a capacity of 80 tons each, producing 395 tons of sulfuric acid; it had built 134 electrolytic cells, producing 155 tons of caustic soda, laying a preliminary foundation for the production of basic chemical raw materials.

The key chemical plants with better technical conditions are actively playing the role of chemical bases and creating conditions for the widespread development of the chemical industry while tapping potential and striving to increase production. The staff and workers of the Yongli Ning Factory, one of China's chemical industry bases, carried out technical revolutions to simplify the process and shorten the sulfur process on the factory's large foreign equipment, resulting in a substantial increase in production. They also established a special technical mobile guidance team to provide guidance to small and medium-sized factories. Jinling, Changjiang, and Liuhe chemical plants have all developed rapidly with the support of Yongli Ning Factory. The experience of producing sulfuric acid using the indigenous contact method created by Yongli Ning Factory has been widely promoted throughout the province with good results. Wuxi Chemical Plant has already produced 88% concentrated sulfuric acid using the indigenous contact method.

The development of the chemical industry enables many resources to be "multi-purpose" and "used to the fullest." Food industries in various regions extract many important chemical raw materials from sweet potatoes, rice bran, straw, cottonseed, and other items. Workers at the Jiangdu County Oil Factory extracted mixed oil from rice bran, which was decomposed into methanol, calcium acetate, acetic acid, high-grade phenolic oil, furfural, light oil, and asphalt. According to preliminary calculations, the chemical products extracted from 10,000 catties of rice bran are worth 1,100 to 1,300 yuan, which is more than ten times the original value of the rice bran. The equipment for extracting "treasure" from rice bran using indigenous methods is very simple. All that is needed is to build a tower-shaped earthen furnace, find a few glass tubes, a few water tanks, and a distillation pot. People's communes throughout the county are actively processing rice bran. At present, 231 furnaces have been built, and 124 have been put into production.

    就地取材　综合利用　土法上马
    江苏大办化学工业
    本报南京23日电　江苏省各地发动群众采取就地取材、综合利用的办法，用土法上马发展化学工业。在短短几个月内，全省从城市到乡村，建起了大大小小的许多化工厂，各种化工产品产量迅速增长。
    原来的一些化学工业“空白”地区，正在从无到有、从小到大地发展化学工业。新海连市地处海滨，有取之不尽的海水，这里有淮北盐场的原盐和卤水，锦屏山下有丰富的磷矿石，都是很好的化工原料。可是，过去这里是江苏省化学工业的空白点。去年新海连市建成了三十多个小型化工厂，现在已能生产三酸二碱等基本化工原料和二十多种化工产品，化学工业的产值很快增长到占全市地方工业产值的三分之一左右。南京市从去年10月以来，发动群众猛攻“三酸二碱”关。生产硫酸没有陶瓷设备，就用酱缸、水缸代替；没有电解槽就用抽水马桶水箱、水泥管代替。到11月底，全市就建成八十吨的硫酸塔二百五十二座，生产出硫酸三百九十五吨；建成电解槽一百三十四只，生产烧碱一百五十五吨，初步打下了生产基本化工原料的基础。
    原来技术条件较好的重点化学工厂，在挖掘潜力努力增产的同时，积极发挥化工基地的作用，为化学工业遍地开花创造条件。我国化学工业基地之一的永利宁厂的职工，在厂内大洋设备上进行了简化工序和缩短硫程的技术革命，使生产有了大幅度的增长。他们还专门成立了技术巡回指导小组，对中小工厂进行指导。金陵、长江、六合等化工厂，都是在永利宁厂支持下迅速发展起来的。永利宁厂创造的制土接触法硫酸的经验，已经在全省广泛推广，效果良好。无锡化工厂用土接触法已经生产出88％的浓硫酸。
    化学工业的发展，使许多资源作到“一物多用”、“物尽其用”。各地食品工业从山芋、米糠、稻草、棉籽等物品中，提取出许多重要的化工原料。江都县油厂的工人从大糠中提出的混合油，分解出甲醇，醋酸钙，醋酸，高级酚油，糠醛，轻油，柏油等产品。据初步计算，一万斤大糠提出来的化工产品价值一千一百元到一千三百元，比大糠的原价值高十几倍。用土法从大糠中取“宝”的设备很简单，只要砌一座塔形的土炉子，找几根玻璃管，几只水缸和一座蒸馏锅就能生产。全县各人民公社纷纷进行大糠加工，现在已建炉二百三十一座，并有一百二十四座投入生产。
