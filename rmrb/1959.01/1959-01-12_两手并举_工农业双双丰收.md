The Gaotang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party implemented the Central Committee's spirit of grasping agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, and launched two waves of large-scale industrial development around the establishment of the People's Communes. The first industrial surge began in May of last year, which was during the intense summer anti-drought "Three Guarantees" (guarantee harvest, guarantee planting, guarantee seedlings) campaign. During the campaign, the problems of insufficient labor and livestock power, lack of fertilizer, and backward tools (especially transportation tools) were prominently exposed, affecting the progress of the campaign. In order to solve these problems, we established thirty-six projects and one hundred and thirty-seven joint factories in a very short period of time, covering iron, woodworking, fertilizer, feed, grain processing, and sewing. Since the autumn, with the realization of communization, new issues have been raised for industry. These mainly include: a bumper agricultural harvest, requiring the processing of one to several times more agricultural products than in the past; the urgent need to improve the living standards of the broad masses of commune members; and the current urgent need for nationwide steelmaking and deep plowing, autumn planting, and water conservancy construction, all of which are making labor increasingly tight. Under these circumstances, on October 15th, we launched the second wave of industrial construction, expanding sixty-two factories for machinery, woodworking, and clothing, and building one hundred and nineteen new factories for papermaking, textile, alcohol, sugar, oil pressing, fertilizer, food, and cotton processing. The establishment of these factories directly supported the greater leap forward in agricultural production and also promoted the great development of commune industry.

Since community-run industry was a new issue, various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking were encountered at the beginning of large-scale industrial development and during the construction phase. The process of large-scale industrial development is the process of implementing the Party's General Line and fighting against right-leaning conservative thought. This struggle became even more acute and prominent after the people's communes were established. These ideas were mainly expressed in the following aspects: (1) Some people did not understand the nature of the People's Communes and their characteristics of being "big and public," and they still insisted on the idea that "farmers should focus on agriculture," saying that the People's Communes were simply agricultural production organizations. (2) Some of the masses and a few commune leading cadres believed that industry and agriculture were contradictory and that engaging in industry would affect agriculture. This argument became more prominent during the busy seasons of deep plowing and autumn harvesting. They shouted: If more people are drawn into factories, we will take measures to "close the gate" and "push them back." (3) In implementing the principle of "small-scale, indigenous, and mass-based" methods, some technical cadres blindly pursued foreign methods, seeking only formality, and proposed "no factory without power machinery, no factory without beautiful buildings, no factory without engineers and experts." According to them, the conditions were not in place, and large-scale industrial development could not be carried out. (4) Some people had a narrow vision, could not see the future of commune industry, adhered to conventions, advocated that commune-run industry should be as small as possible, regarded "small-scale, indigenous, and mass-based" methods as a collection of handicrafts, and demanded that communes engage in industry during the agricultural slack season after autumn, and do it slowly after agriculture was done well. In response to the above ideological problems, the county committee carefully and comprehensively analyzed them and unanimously believed that these ideas were essentially due to insufficient understanding of the Party's policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and misunderstanding of the principle of "small-scale as the main focus, combining small and medium, starting small and growing large, indigenous as the main focus, combining indigenous and foreign, starting with indigenous and moving to foreign, from low to high."

They are like Tieguai Li (an immortal known for his lame leg), only knowing how to walk on one leg and not being used to walking on two legs. According to their logic, communes should not and cannot run industry. The county committee analyzed the necessity and possibility of large-scale development of county and commune industries, unswervingly implemented the Party's instructions, implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and "small-scale, indigenous, and mass-based" methods, and conducted a large-scale debate among the whole Party and the entire people. The main topics of the debate were: (1) Why must counties and communes develop industry on a large scale? (2) What is the correct relationship between industry and agriculture? (3) Can we run industry? (4) What principles should be adopted for running industry? Who should we rely on to run industry? Which industries should we run? etc. In the debate, we adopted the method of "explaining the principles, calculating the details, and talking about the prospects," carried out propaganda and mobilization from top to bottom, organized exposure and debate from bottom to top, and carried out debates using large and small meetings, field breaks, construction sites, workshops, before and after meals, and other occasions. More than 64,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county to launch a fierce attack on right-leaning conservatives, and a propaganda army of 10,000 people was organized to universally educate the broad masses of people about the benefits of developing industry to farmers, and the number of people educated reached more than 300,000. Through propaganda, a competition movement of learning from the advanced, breaking with conservatism, comparing creations, and comparing inventions was launched.

Secondly, the practice of large-scale industrial development has proved the mutually promoting role of industry and agriculture. Over the past year, we have always adhered to the principle of doing what is needed and doing what we have. Especially in the agricultural anti-drought "Three Guarantees" campaign, a comprehensive assault was launched on the industrial front. In less than a month, the county rushed to manufacture 15,650 water-lifting tools, overcame the severe drought of 300 days without soaking rain, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The great leap forward in agriculture promoted the great development of industry, and the great development of industry in turn greatly supported the leap forward in agriculture. The facts of the past year have proved that industrial development has shown a huge role in production, life, and socialist construction.

After the whole Party and the whole people unified their thinking, in order to ensure the comprehensive leap forward centered on industrial and agricultural production, the county committee emphasized comprehensively arranging all work centered on industrial and agricultural production, and unified the organization of industrial and agricultural teams from the county to the commune, dividing them into two fronts. Through the leadership method of "four samenesses" and "dual management," industrial and agricultural production were closely combined. The "four samenesses" are: making arrangements for industrial production at the same time as studying and arranging agricultural production; checking the quality of industrial production serving agricultural production at the same time as checking agricultural production; evaluating the achievements of industrial production serving agricultural production at the same time as evaluating agricultural production; and summarizing the experiences of industrial production serving agricultural production at the same time as summarizing agricultural production. "Dual management" means: grasping both agriculture and industry, and the agricultural base point of the county committee is also the industrial base point. Tightly twisting industrial and agricultural production into one rope, one content with two movements, interacting and developing together. For example, the anti-drought sowing movement in agricultural production is also the production movement of large-scale water-lifting tools on the industrial front, the fertilizer delivery movement in agricultural production is also the "three-ization" movement (namely, bearing-ization, cart-ization, and wooden track-ization) on the industrial production front. The deep plowing and sowing movement in agricultural production is also the production movement of rushing to manufacture deep plowing and close planting industries on the industrial production front. And so on, in each production link, agriculture gives topics to industry, and industry sets tasks and measures according to the needs of agricultural production. The result of doing so is that cadres in charge of industry feel that they lose their direction of production if they leave agriculture, and cadres in charge of agriculture feel that without industry, the completion of tasks is not guaranteed.

The Party Central Committee instructed us to carry out mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front. This policy is very correct. Whether to rely on a few technical personnel or on the masses to run industry is also a struggle between two ideas and two lines.

In the process of large-scale industrial development in Gaotang County, some people opposed carrying out mass movements on a large scale. They thought it was okay to engage in agriculture, but it would not work to engage in industry, saying that farmers were laymen in industry, "country bumpkins" who did not understand science, and therefore mobilizing the masses was useless. In their work, they always wanted to simply rely on administrative orders to force the masses to act according to their own subjective wishes. They could not see the infinite wisdom and enormous power in the masses, and they did not understand that socialist industrialization was in the vital interests of the broadest masses. If we do not rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, it is impossible for the cause of socialist industrialization to achieve high-speed development. Therefore, in the movement of the whole people engaging in industry on a large scale, the county committee always adhered to the principle of combining the mass line with centralized leadership, relying on the Party's strong leadership, implementing political leadership, strictly criticizing the ideological style of not believing in the masses and being divorced from the masses, mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans, and organizing the masses to offer suggestions and solutions to solve various difficulties in the process of running industry. As a result of deeply mobilizing the masses, the masses actively and voluntarily did their best to support and participate in industrial construction. They put forward the slogan "Do your own things, build your own factories." And launched a "Three Contributions" movement (namely, contributing talent, materials, and methods). According to statistics, the masses recommended more than 1,900 technical talents of various types, contributed 64 kinds of materials such as copper, iron, bricks, tiles, and wood, and also funds of more than 3 million yuan, ensuring that the county overfulfilled its factory construction plan under the principle of self-reliance.

Over the past year, in the process of large-scale industrial development, we have deeply realized that the victory of industrial construction is also the victory of the mass line.

The purpose of running industry is to produce industrial products. Therefore, after the factories were built, we tightly grasped strengthening production management (including planning, quotas, and finance), emphasized economic accounting, improved product quality, reduced costs, and established and improved Party and League organizations and various living systems. Such as technical research and learning organizations, labor systems and financial accounting systems. After the implementation of "two factories and one station" (namely, the commune joint general factory, the farming area-run branch factory, and the production team-run joint processing station), there were conditions to quickly put production on a regular basis.

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees, the county and commune industries in Gaotang County have developed greatly over the past year, but they are still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production and the increasing needs of the people. More importantly, there is still a big gap with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees, especially the machinery industry and the chemical industry are still a weak link. Therefore, according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we have proposed that while consolidating the existing industry, in 1959 we should develop the machinery industry on a large scale to serve the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification; vigorously develop water conservancy, wind power, biogas, waste gas, and thermal power generation, and carry out a nationwide power generation movement to meet the growing demand for electricity brought about by the great development of industry and agriculture; vigorously develop the chemical fertilizer industry to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture. And organize a great leap forward in transportation work to completely realize the roller bearing-ization and cart-ization of transportation tools. At the same time, we must also develop commodity production to meet the needs of people's lives and increase commune income. (Attached pictures)

    两手并举　工农业双双丰收
    中共山东省高唐县委员会第一书记　曹子丹
    高唐县委贯彻党中央一手抓农业，一手抓工业的精神，于人民公社成立前后掀起了两次大办工业高潮。第一次工业高潮是从去年5月开始的，当时正处于夏季抗旱三保
  （保收、保种、保苗）运动，农活十分紧张的季节。在运动中，突出的暴露了劳畜力不足、肥料缺乏、工具落后（特别是运输工具）等问题，影响着运动前进。为了解决这些问题，我们在很短的时间内建起了铁、木业、肥料、饲料、粮食加工、缝纫等三十六个项目，一百三十七个联合工厂。入秋以来，随着公社化的实现，又为工业提出了新的课题。这主要是：农业大丰收，比过去多一倍到几倍的农产品需要加工处理，广大社员提高生活的要求更加迫切，当前的全民性的炼钢和深耕、秋种、水利建设都很紧迫，劳力越来越显得紧张。在这种情况下，我们于10月15日又掀起了第二次工业建设高潮，扩建了机械、木业、被服等厂子六十二处，新建了造纸、纺织、酒精、制糖、榨油、肥料、食品、棉花加工等厂子一百一十九处。这些工厂的建立，直接支援了农业生产的更大跃进，同时也促进了公社工业大发展。
    由于社办工业是个新的问题，因此，在大办工业的开始，以及进入建设阶段以后，曾遇到了形形色色的右倾保守思想。大办工业的过程就是贯彻党的总路线，和右倾保守思想作斗争的过程。特别是人民公社化后，这个斗争更显得尖锐突出。这些思想主要是表现在以下几个方面：（一）有些人不了解人民公社的性质和人民公社又大又公的特点，他们仍坚持“农民就得以农业为主”的主张，说什么人民公社就是单纯的农业生产的组织。（二）部分群众和少数公社领导干部认为工业和农业有矛盾，搞工业就会影响农业。这种论调到秋天深翻地、秋收农忙季节更为突出。他们叫喊：再抽人到工厂，就采取“关闸”“顶回去”的手段。（三）在贯彻执行小土群方针上，有一部分技术干部迷信洋法，盲目追求形式，提出“没有动力机械不办，没有漂亮的厂房不办，没有工程师、专家不办”。照他们的说法是，条件不具备，不能大办工业。（四）也有一部分人眼光狭隘，看不到公社工业的前途，墨守成规，主张公社办工业愈小愈好，把小土群看成是手工业的集汇，要求公社搞工业在秋后农闲时去搞，搞好了农业再搞工业，慢慢的来。针对上述思想问题，县委认真地全面地作了分析，一致认为：这些思想实质上是对党的工农业并举的方针认识不足，是对以小为主，中小结合，先小后大，以土为主，土洋结合，先土后洋，由低到高的方针的误解。
    他们和铁拐李一样，只会用一条腿走路，不习惯于用两条腿走路。按照他们的逻辑，就是公社不要办工业，也不能办工业。县委分析了大办县社工业的必要性和可能性，坚定不移地贯彻党的指示，执行工农业同时并举和小土群的方针，并在全党和全体人民中进行了大辩论。辩论的主要题目是：（一）县社为什么必须大办工业？（二）工农业的正确关系是什么？（三）我们能不能办工业？（四）办工业采取什么方针？依靠谁来办工业？办哪些工业？等等。在辩论中，我们采取了“讲道理、算细账、话前景”的方法，自上而下地进行宣传发动，自下而上地组织鸣放辩论，利用大会、小会、田间休息、工地、车间、饭前饭后等场合开展了争辩，全县张贴大字报六万四千余张，向右倾保守主义者进行了猛攻，并组织了万人的宣传大军利用各种形式向广大人民群众普遍地进行了发展工业给农民带来好处的教育，受教育的人数达三十余万人之多。通过宣传，掀起了学先进、破保守、比创造、比发明的竞赛运动。
    其次，大办工业的实践，证明了工业、农业相互促进的作用。一年来，我们始终坚持了需要什么办什么，有什么办什么的原则，特别是在农业抗旱“三保”运动中，在工业战线上，进行了全面突击，不到一个月的时间，全县赶制提水工具一万五千六百五十件，战胜了三百天无透雨的大旱，夺得了空前大丰收。农业大跃进带动了工业的大发展，工业的大发展反过来又大大地支持了农业的跃进。一年来的事实证明，工业发展已经在生产、生活和建设社会主义等方面显示了巨大作用。
    在全党全民思想统一以后，为了保证以工农业生产为中心的全面跃进，县委强调了以工农业生产为中心全面安排各项工作，从县到社统一组织了工业和农业两支队伍划分两条战线。并通过“四同”“双管”的领导方法把工农业生产紧紧结合在一起。“四同”是：研究安排农业的同时作好工业生产的安排；检查农业生产的同时检查工业生产为农业生产服务的好坏；评比农业生产的同时评比工业为农业生产服务的成绩；总结农业生产的同时总结工业生产为农业生产服务的经验。“双管”是：既抓农业又抓工业，县委的农业基点又是工业基点。把工农业生产紧紧拧成一股绳，一个内容两个运动，相互作用，共同发展。例如农业生产上的抗旱播种运动又是工业战线上的大搞提水工具的生产运动，农业生产上的送肥运动又是工业生产战线上的“三化”运动（即轴承化、车子化、木质轨道化）。农业生产上的深翻播种运动又是工业生产上的赶制深翻密植工业的生产运动。如此等等，每个生产环节，农业都为工业出题目，工业根据农业生产的需要定任务，定措施。这样做的结果，使管工业的干部感觉到离开农业就失去了生产方向，管农业的干部感到没有工业，任务的完成就没有保证。
    党中央指示我们要在工业战线上大搞群众运动，这一方针是十分正确的，办工业依靠少数技术人员，还是依靠群众这也是两种思想两条路线的斗争。
    高唐县在大办工业的过程中，曾有一些人反对大搞群众运动，他们认为搞农业还可以，搞工业则行不通，说什么农民在工业上是外行，是“土包子”不懂科学，因而发动群众没用处，在工作中，他们总想单纯的依靠行政命令，强迫群众按照自己的主观愿望办事，他们既看不到群众中的无穷智慧和巨大力量，又不懂得社会主义工业化是最广大群众的切身利益，如果不依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性，社会主义工业化的事业就不可能取得高速度的发展。因此，在全民大搞工业的运动中，县委始终坚持了群众路线同集中领导相结合的原则，依靠党的坚强领导，实行政治挂帅，严格批判了那种不相信群众和脱离群众的思想作风，发动群众讨论制订规划，组织群众献策献计，解决办工业过程中的各种困难。深入发动群众的结果，群众积极主动的去尽自己的一切力量支援和参与工业建设。他们提出了“自己的事自己办，自己的工厂自己建”的口号。并掀起了“三献”运动（即献人才、物料、办法）。据统计，群众共推荐各种技术人才一千九百余名，献出铜、铁、砖、瓦、木材等物料达六十四种，还有资金三百余万元，保证全县在自力更生的原则下超额完成了建厂计划。
    一年来，在大办工业的过程中，使我们深刻地认识到：工业建设的胜利也是群众路线的胜利。
    办工业的目的在于生产工业产品，因此，工厂建起来之后，我们就紧紧抓住了加强生产管理（包括计划、定额、财务），强调经济核算，提高产品质量，降低成本，建立健全了党团组织，和生活各项制度。如技术研究和学习组织、劳动制度和财会制度等。实行“两厂一站”（即公社联合总厂、耕区办分厂和生产队办联合加工站）以后，就有条件迅速地把生产纳入了正规。
    在党中央和省地委的领导下，高唐县一年来县、社工业有了很大发展，但是还远远不能满足农业生产和日益增长的需要，更重要的是与党中央和省地委的要求还有很大距离，特别是机械工业和化工工业还是一个薄弱环节。因此，我们根据八届六中全会精神，提出了在巩固现有工业的同时，1959年要大办机械工业，为实现农业机械化、电气化服务；大搞水利、风力、沼气、废气和火力发电，开展全民办电运动，以适应工农业大发展带来的用电量日益增长的需要；大搞化工化肥工业，保证农业大丰收。并组织运输工作大跃进，彻底实现运输工具滚珠轴承化、车子化。同时还要发展商品生产，以满足人民生活需要和增加公社收入。（附图片）
