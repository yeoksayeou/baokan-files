Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 22nd. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, meeting in Berlin on the 21st, unanimously passed the resolution on the 1959 National Economic Development Plan and the decree on the 1959 National Budget. The meeting also approved the report on the implementation of the 1957 National Budget.

According to the report made to the People's Chamber by Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Bruno Leuschner, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic in 1959 will increase by 11.1% compared to 1958. The total state investment will be 14.7 billion marks, an increase of 20% compared to 1958, equivalent to the total for 1954 and 1955.

In 1959, the chemical industry will increase by 9.6%, power industry production will increase by 10.6%, metallurgy will increase by 8.2%, and heavy machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 12.4%. In the chemical industry, plastics and synthetic fibers are the focus of development.

This year, state investment in agriculture will increase by 400 million marks compared to last year. The number of slaughtered livestock will increase by 80,000 tons this year compared to last year, milk will increase by 640,000 tons, and eggs will increase by approximately 128 million. This will reduce imports of these products this year, thereby allowing industry to obtain more imported raw materials.

In terms of supply, residents of the German Democratic Republic will receive 4 billion marks worth of more goods this year compared to last year. According to the plan, this year the German Democratic Republic will approach the best years' levels of West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of leather shoes and silk fabrics.

This year, the working people of the German Democratic Republic will receive 91,500 new homes, which is 29,400 more homes than were built last year.

In his report, Leuschner stated that this year is the decisive year to catch up with West Germany by 1961, and all production must develop at a higher speed. To this end, it is necessary to increase labor productivity, and the key to increasing labor productivity is to correctly apply advanced science and technology. He said that the German Democratic Republic is currently at the forefront of the world in some scientific and technological fields, such as electron microscopes. This year, scientific and technological aspects will receive comprehensive development. He also said that production automation is the direction of future industrial and agricultural development.

Leuschner also pointed out that the three basic issues in this year's economic work are to systematically implement scientific and technological progress, economize on investment, and conserve raw materials. Solving these problems will enable the national economy to develop rapidly.

    德意志民主共和国加速建设步伐
    人民议院通过今年经济计划　建设投资大大增加
    新华社柏林22日电　21日在柏林举行的德意志民主共和国人民议院会议，一致通过了关于1959年国民经济发展计划的决议和1959年国家预算的法令。会议还批准了1957年国家预算执行情况的报告。
    根据副总理兼国家计划委员会主席布鲁诺·洛伊施纳向人民议院作的报告，1959年德意志民主共和国的工业总产值将比1958年增长11.1％；国家投资总额是一百四十七亿马克，比1958年增加20％，而相当于1954年和1955年的总和。
    在1959年，化学工业将增加9.6％，动力工业生产增加10.6％，冶金增加8.2％，重型机器制造工业增加12.4％。在化学工业中，塑料和合成纤维是发展的重点。
    今年国家对农业的投资较去年增加四亿马克。屠宰牲畜今年将比去年增加八万吨，牛奶增加六十四万吨，鸡蛋约增加一亿二千八百万个。这将使今年这些产品的进口有所减少，从而使工业获得更多的进口原料。
    在供应方面，今年德意志民主共和国的居民将较去年多获得价值四十亿马克的物资。根据计划，今年德意志民主共和国在按人口平均的皮鞋和丝织品消费量方面将接近西德最好年代的水平。
    今年，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民将获得九万一千五百幢新的住宅，即比去年建成的住宅多二万九千四百幢。
    洛伊施纳在报告中提出，今年是在1961年赶上西德的决定性的一年，各项生产必须有更高速度的发展。为此，必须提高劳动生产率，而提高劳动生产率的中心是正确地应用先进科学技术。他说，目前德意志民主共和国在某些科学技术方面已居于世界首位，如电子显微镜。今年科学技术方面将获得全面的发展。他又说，生产自动化是今后工农业发展的方向。
    洛伊施纳还指出，有组织地贯彻科学技术的进步，节约利用投资和节约原料是今年经济工作中的三个基本问题。解决这些问题，才能使国民经济得到迅速的发展。
