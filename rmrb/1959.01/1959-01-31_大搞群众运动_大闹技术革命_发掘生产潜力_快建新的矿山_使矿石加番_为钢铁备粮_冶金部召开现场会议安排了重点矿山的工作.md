Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, January 30th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently convened a national on-site conference on ferrous metallurgy geology and mines in Nanfen. The conference proposed that increasing the production of iron ore and other raw materials for the steel industry by every possible means, and providing abundant "grain" for the great leap forward in the steel industry, is a major and glorious task for the workers and staff of the national ferrous metallurgy mines.

The conference called on the ferrous metallurgy mines and geological exploration departments to launch mass movements and vigorously promote technical revolution, give full play to the production potential of existing mines, and at the same time accelerate the basic construction of mines, so as to ensure a greater leap forward in the production of raw materials for the steel industry this year.

Participating in the conference were representatives from key mines and geological exploration departments of the national ferrous metallurgy system, metallurgical bureaus of some provinces, and related universities and scientific research institutions. The conference summarized the rich experience of the great leap forward in the production of key mines last year, studied the situation and tasks facing the production of raw materials for the steel industry this year, and arranged the production work of key mines in 1959.

The information provided by the conference indicated that in 1958, China's production and construction of iron ore and other raw materials for the steel industry achieved great success. Iron ore production increased several times, ensuring the victorious realization of the national steel production plan in 1958. In 1959, steel production will have a greater leap forward than in 1958, and the production of raw materials for the steel industry must also have a greater leap forward, staying ahead of steel production and meeting the needs of steel production in terms of quantity, quality, and variety. The conference pointed out that the dozens of key mines across the country are the main force in the production of raw materials for the steel industry this year, and these mines will undertake about 70% of the production tasks this year. According to the preliminary arrangements, the iron ore production of key mines this year will increase by about 100% compared with last year, and the absolute increase will greatly exceed that of last year; the production of manganese ore, magnesite, silica, dolomite, refractory clay, etc., will also have a great increase.

The conference believes that although the production tasks of ferrous metallurgy mines this year are very arduous, as long as we conscientiously implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to go all out, aim high, break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and further launch mass movements and vigorously promote technical revolution, fully tap the production potential of existing mines, and speed up the construction of new and expanded mine projects, we will be confident in completing this year's production tasks.

The conference clearly pointed out that giving full play to the production potential of existing mining enterprises is of great significance for completing this year's ore production tasks. A large part of the increased ore production this year will be achieved by tapping the production potential, which requires key mines to further launch mass movements and vigorously promote technical revolution. In launching mass movements and technical revolution, in accordance with the spirit of "10-point targets and 12-point measures," we must promptly guide the enthusiasm of the masses and the spearhead of technical revolution to solving key problems and overcoming weak links to ensure increased output and quality. In terms of increasing output, it is necessary to greatly increase the mining intensity of mines and the utilization coefficient of mineral processing ball mills, which are comprehensive indicators of good or bad production. The conference pointed out that the Nanfen open-pit iron mine has jumped to the first place in the country in mining intensity because it mobilized the masses to solve key production problems. The ore produced per meter of working line of the benches of this open-pit mine has increased from an average of 205 tons throughout 1957 to 423 tons in the fourth quarter of 1958. If the mining intensity of all open-pit iron mines in the country can reach the level of the Nanfen open-pit iron mine, more than 10 million tons of iron ore can be produced annually without increasing equipment and investment; if the underground mining intensity is also increased accordingly, the iron ore produced annually in the country will be even more considerable. The ball mill utilization coefficient (tons of ore processed per cubic meter of volume per hour) of the Nanfen concentrator in the fourth quarter of last year has reached 4.37 tons; if the ball mill utilization coefficient of all concentrators in the country can reach this level, more than 1.8 million tons of concentrate can be produced annually. Last year, the Nanfen concentrator also increased the iron content of the concentrate from about 60% to more than 65% (an increase of 1% in the iron content of the concentrate can increase the production of blast furnaces by 2%) due to the mobilization of the masses to vigorously promote technical revolution; if all concentrators in the country can reach the level of the Nanfen concentrator, it will be of great significance for increasing the national pig iron production. In terms of variety, the conference called for vigorously increasing the production of rich iron ore, manganese ore, refractory clay and other raw materials that are currently in urgent need.

The conference also exchanged the experience of key mines in "walking on two legs." The conference pointed out that implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" is an important guarantee for rapidly increasing the production of raw materials for the steel industry. Last year, Yantongshan Iron Mine of Longyan Iron and Steel Company adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, making use of local conditions and materials, and establishing four surrounding iron mines, laying the foundation for doubling production this year. The conference believes that vigorously developing surrounding mines is an important way for existing production mining enterprises to give play to their production potential and increase ore production, and requires all mines with resource conditions to vigorously develop surrounding mines to promote a leap in production.

In order to ensure the rapid growth of raw material production for the steel industry, the conference believes that accelerating the construction speed of new and expanded mines is very important, not only for this year's production, but also for an important guarantee for a greater leap forward next year.

The conference also exchanged experiences in ferrous metallurgy geological exploration, arranged this year's geological exploration tasks, and required geological workers to accelerate exploration and create conditions for mine construction.

This conference started on January 19th and lasted for six days. During the conference, in addition to visiting the Nanfen open-pit iron mine and concentrator, the representatives also listened to the introduction of advanced experience of 21 units, and held discussions on some important experiences. The representatives attending the conference unanimously believed that the experiences exchanged this time were important and pointed out the direction for the great leap forward in production in 1959.

    大搞群众运动　大闹技术革命　发掘生产潜力　快建新的矿山
    使矿石加番　为钢铁备粮
    冶金部召开现场会议安排了重点矿山的工作
    新华社本溪30日电　冶金工业部最近在南芬召开了全国黑色冶金地质矿山现场会议。这次会议提出：千方百计地增产铁矿石及其他钢铁工业原料，给钢铁工业大跃进提供丰足的“粮食”，是全国黑色冶金矿山职工的一项重大而光荣的任务。
    会议要求黑色冶金矿山及地质勘探部门大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命，充分发挥现有矿山生产潜力，同时加速矿山基本建设，以保证今年钢铁工业原料生产更大跃进。
    参加会议的，有全国黑色冶金系统的重点矿山、地质勘探部门，部分省的冶金局，以及有关的高等学校和科学研究机关的代表。会议总结了去年重点矿山生产大跃进的丰富经验，研究了今年钢铁工业原料生产所面临的形势和任务，安排了重点矿山1959年的生产工作。
    会议提供的情况说明，1958年我国铁矿石及其他钢铁工业原料的生产建设获得了巨大的成就，铁矿石产量成倍地增长，保证了1958年全国钢铁生产计划的胜利实现。1959年钢铁生产比1958年有一个更大的跃进，钢铁工业原料的生产也必须来一个更大的跃进，走在钢铁生产的前面，从数量、质量、品种各方面满足钢铁生产的需要。会议指出，全国几十个重点矿山是今年钢铁工业原料生产的主力军，今年70％左右的生产任务将由这些矿山担负。根据初步安排的计划，今年重点矿山铁矿石产量将比去年增长一倍左右，增长的绝对量大大超过了去年；锰矿、镁砂、矽石、白云石、耐火粘土等的产量，也都将有很大的增长。
    会议认为，今年黑色冶金矿山的生产任务虽然十分艰巨，但是只要认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，破除迷信，解放思想，进一步大搞群众运动和大闹技术革命，充分挖掘现有矿山的生产潜力，加快新建和改建矿山工程的建设速度，就会有把握完成今年的生产任务。
    会议明确指出，充分发挥现有矿山企业的生产潜力，对完成今年矿石生产任务有着极重大的意义。今年增产的矿石中，有很大一部分要通过挖掘生产潜力的办法来实现，这就要求重点矿山必须进一步大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。在大搞群众运动和技术革命中，要根据“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神，及时地把群众的热情和技术革命的矛头引向解决关键问题、克服薄弱环节，保证提高产量和质量。在增加产量方面，要大大提高矿山采矿强度和选矿球磨机利用系数，这是标志生产好坏的综合性指标。会议指出，南芬露天铁矿由于发动群众解决了生产关键问题，采矿强度已跃居全国第一，这个露天矿的每月每公尺台阶工作线生产的矿石，已由1957年全年平均二百零五吨，提高到1958年第四季度的四百二十三吨。如果全国露天铁矿采矿强度都能达到南芬露天铁矿的水平，在不增加设备和投资的情况下，一年就可以增产铁矿石一千多万吨；如果井下采矿强度也相应地提高，那末全国一年增产的铁矿石将更为可观。南芬选矿厂去年第四季度球磨机利用系数（每立方公尺容积每小时处理矿石吨数）已经达到四点三七吨；如果全国选矿厂球磨机利用系数都能达到这个水平，一年就可以增产一百八十多万吨精矿。南芬选矿厂去年还由于发动群众大搞技术革命，把精矿含铁量由60％左右提高到65％以上（精矿含铁量增长1％，可使高炉增产2％）；全国选矿厂如果都能达到南芬选矿厂的水平，那末对于增加全国生铁产量就有着极为重大的意义。在品种方面，会议要求大力增产富铁矿、锰矿、耐火粘土等目前急需的原料。
    会议还交流了重点矿山“两条腿走路”的经验。会议指出，贯彻
  “两条腿走路”的方针，是迅速增加钢铁工业原料生产的一项重要保证。龙烟钢铁公司烟筒山铁矿去年采取土洋结合、因陋就简、就地取材的办法，开办了四个外围铁矿，给今年生产翻番奠定了基础。会议认为大搞外围矿山，是现有生产矿山企业发挥生产潜力、增加矿石产量的一条重要途径，要求凡是有资源条件的矿山，都要大搞外围矿山，促进产量飞跃提高。
    为了保证钢铁工业原料产量的迅速增长，会议认为加快新建扩建矿山的建设速度，是十分重要的，这不仅是为了今年的生产，也是明年更大跃进的重要保证。
    会议还交流了黑色冶金地质勘探方面的经验，安排了今年的地质勘探任务，要求地质工作者加速勘探，为矿山建设创造条件。
    这次会议是1月19日开始的，共开了六天。会议期间，代表们除了参观南芬露天铁矿和选矿厂以外，还听了二十一个单位先进经验的介绍，并且就某些重要经验进行了座谈讨论。参加会议的代表们一致认为，这次交流的经验都是重要的，给1959年的生产大跃进指出了方向。（附图片）
