Strive for High Speed in Transportation
    Li Yuchang

    The Soviet Union's space rocket, at a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, broke free from Earth's gravity and became the world's first artificial satellite. Today, when the beautiful ideal of interstellar travel may soon be realized, it is interesting to recall the history of mankind's efforts to increase transportation speed over the centuries.

    We know that under normal circumstances, a person's walking speed is 5 kilometers per hour, a running horse-drawn carriage is 10 kilometers per hour, and a skier's speed is 18 kilometers per hour. Cavalry at a regular pace travels at 6 kilometers per hour, and at a fast pace at 12.6 kilometers per hour. For many years, people were unable to surpass these speeds in transportation. It wasn't until the 18th century, with the advent of steam-powered machinery—the steam engine—and its use in manufacturing steam locomotives, that humanity first had vehicles powered by engines. Their speed ranged from dozens of kilometers per hour to over a hundred kilometers per hour.

    The birth of the internal combustion engine brought another step forward in transportation speed. Its principle is simple: atomized gasoline is mixed with air and ignited in a cylinder to make the machine run. Compared to the steam engine, it has higher efficiency. The efficiency of a steam engine is only about 8%, meaning that about 90% of the heat released by burning coal in the combustion chamber is lost, while the efficiency of an internal combustion engine can be increased to 30%. The speed of cars using internal combustion engines is roughly the same as that of trains.

    In the 20th century, the most popular form of power is electricity. Because electric motors are easy to operate and have an efficiency of over 90%, they are widely used in industry. However, as a transportation power source, electric motors are not particularly convenient. This is because vehicles require the engine to have maximum horsepower during the starting process, but AC motors are precisely the weakest at this time.

    To fly freely in the sky and increase the speed of transportation has been an ideal cherished by people for many years. Ancient Chinese books contain legends of the flying chariot of Qigongshi and the wooden kite of Gongshuban. Ancient Greece also had the myth of Daedalus and his son using bird feathers to make wings and flying out of a prison cage. Russian chronicles record that the serf Nikita made a flight on a machine with wings. The Tsar believed that this person violated nature and sentenced him to death. Just as the development of human society cannot be stopped by any ruler, the development of transportation speed cannot be stopped by any ruler either. In the mid-19th century, Russian naval officer Mozhaisky, the "father of aviation," made a large kite and flew into the sky while sitting on it. Later, he continued his research and built an airplane equipped with a steam engine and three propellers.

    For military and transportation needs, mankind has tried many ways to increase the speed of airplanes. The record of the highest airplane speed is: 40 kilometers per hour in 1884, 41.3 kilometers per hour in 1906, 174.1 kilometers per hour in 1912, 330.3 kilometers per hour in 1921, 473.8 kilometers per hour in 1932, 709.2 kilometers per hour in 1934, 975.1 kilometers per hour in 1945, and 1,079 kilometers in 1948. Today, many supersonic aircraft have appeared (the speed of sound at sea level is 1,224 kilometers per hour). If the improvement in the speed of airplanes from the beginning of this century to around the end of World War II was only a gradual quantitative change, then the change in airplanes from approaching the speed of sound to exceeding the speed of sound can be said to be a profound and essential change.

    Originally, when the speed of an airplane is less than the speed of sound, the resistance of the surrounding gas to it is basically of two types: one is the friction between the gas and the various parts of the airplane. The way to reduce friction is to make the surface as smooth as possible. The other is the resistance the airplane's head receives - form drag. For example, when a ship moves in a lake, it constantly causes vortices behind it. These vortices form a low-pressure area behind the ship, which causes the ship to experience a large pressure coming head-on. This pressure is also the pressure the ship experiences in motion. The same is true for airplanes. The way to reduce this resistance is to make the fuselage streamlined. When an airplane rises from subsonic to supersonic speed, its resistance increases rapidly due to the shock wave generated in front of the airplane. For an airplane of the same size and shape, when the speed increases from 600 kilometers per hour to 1,200 kilometers per hour, although the speed only doubles, the resistance is thirty-two times that of the former. Therefore, building supersonic aircraft requires engines that are more powerful, smaller in size, and lighter in weight. This has made the internal combustion engine, which was once very superior in terms of horsepower-to-weight ratio, obsolete! The new jet engine replaced the internal combustion engine. The jet speed is eight-thirds of a kilometer per second, or approximately 2.7 kilometers.

    It is no exaggeration to say that without jet engines, there would be no space rockets today. Propeller engines rely on pushing the surrounding air to generate a reaction force to move forward. However, there is no air outside the atmosphere, and the propeller loses its function. Without jet engines, it is unimaginable to launch a rocket out of Earth's gravitational field.

    Although mankind has now mastered the first cosmic velocity and the second cosmic velocity, the latter speed is more than eight thousand times faster than people's walking speed, and more than a thousand times faster than the highest speed of airplanes seventy years ago, this is far from the ideal speed for mankind. Mankind must strive to master the third cosmic velocity in order to break out of the solar system, and fly to other "solar systems," and to the vast and boundless universe at much higher speeds. Therefore, continuing to strive for high speed remains an urgent task for scientists. We know that multi-stage chemical fuel rockets that achieve the first and second cosmic velocities can potentially increase to the third cosmic velocity of 16 kilometers per second. However, chemical fuel rockets are not suitable for long-distance and long-term space flights. Therefore, ion rockets, nuclear rockets, and photon rockets have become the objects of research for people to further increase flight speed. Using ion rockets, people estimate that they can achieve a speed of 30 to 40 kilometers per second. If nuclear energy is used, it is calculated that a first-stage rocket can reach the first cosmic velocity of 8 kilometers per second, and adding two stages of liquid fuel rockets can achieve even higher speeds. Photon rockets can accelerate the rocket to a speed close to the speed of light (for example, 200,000 kilometers per second). From the current technical level, the realization of ion rockets and nuclear rockets will not be a distant matter, perhaps in less than ten years. The realization of photon rockets, as of now, still has many difficulties waiting to be overcome. It can be said with certainty that in the near future, mankind will achieve greater achievements in space flight than in the past few years.

    力争交通的高速度
    李毓昌
    苏联的宇宙火箭以每秒十一点二公里的速度挣脱了地球的引力，成为世界第一颗人造行星。在很快就可能实现星际飞行这一美丽理想的今天，回忆一下几百年来人类提高交通速度的历史，是一件很有意思的事。
    我们知道，在通常情况下，人步行的速度是每小时五公里，奔跑的马车每小时是十公里，滑雪的人每小时是十八公里。骑兵常步是每小时六公里，骑兵快步是每小时十二点六公里。多少年来，人们在交通上没有能够超越过这样的速度。直到十八世纪，出现了使用蒸汽的动力机械——蒸汽机，并用来制造蒸汽机车。人类史上才第一次有了使用动力的车辆。它的速度是每小时几十公里到一百多公里。
    内燃机的诞生使交通速度提高一步。它的原理很简单，就是把雾化后的汽油同空气混合在一起，在汽缸内点燃爆炸，使机器运转。同蒸汽机相比，它有较高的效率。蒸汽机的效率只有8％左右，也就是说在燃烧室中燃煤所释放出来的热量的90％左右都散失掉，而内燃机的效率可以提高到30％。使用内燃机的汽车的速度同火车大致相仿。
    二十世纪最受欢迎的一种动力是电能。由于电动机操纵便利，效率高达90％以上，所以它在工业上得到广泛的应用。但是作为交通动力来说，电动机并不特别便利。这是因为车辆在起动过程中，要求发动机有最大的马力，可是交流电动机恰恰在这时最没劲。
    在天空中自由自在地飞行，以提高交通速度，是人们多少年以来抱有的理想。我国古书中就有奇肱氏的飞车，公输般的木鸢等传说。古希腊也有德达尔父子用鸟的羽毛做翅膀，飞出囚笼的神话。在俄国编年史中记载着，农奴尼基塔在一台带翅膀的机器上作了一次飞行。沙皇认为这个人违反自然，将他判处了死刑。正像人类社会的发展，没有任何统治者能够阻止得了一样，交通速度的发展，也是任何统治者阻止不了的。十九世纪中叶，“航空的祖国”的俄罗斯海军军官莫扎依斯基做了很大的风筝，自己坐着飞上了天。以后他继续进行研究，制成了装有蒸汽发动机和三个螺旋桨的飞机。
    为了军事上和交通上的需要，人类曾多方设法提高飞机的速度。飞机的最高速度纪录是：1884年每小时四十公里，1906年每小时四十一点三公里，1912年每小时一百七十四点一公里，1921年每小时三百三十点三公里，1932年每小时四百七十三点八公里，1934年每小时七百零九点二公里，1945年九百七十五点一公里，1948年一千零七十九公里。到今天，已经有不少超声速的飞机出现了（声音在海平面的速度是每小时一千二百二十四公里）。如果说从本世纪初起到第二次世界大战结束前后飞机在速度方面的改进还只是一个逐渐的量变，那么飞机从接近声速到超过声速这当中的变化，可以说是一个深刻的本质的变化。
    原来飞机的速度比声速还小时，周围气体对它的阻力基本上有两种：一种是气体同飞机各部分的摩擦力。减少摩擦力的办法是尽可能把表面做得光滑一些。另外一种是飞机头部所受的阻力——型阻，如船在湖水中前进时，它的后面不断引起漩涡，这些漩涡形成了船背后的低压区，因而使船受到了迎面而来的大压力，这个压力也便是船在行进中的压力。飞机也是同样。减少这种阻力的办法是把飞机机身做成流线形。当飞机由亚声速上升到超声速时，由于飞机前面产生了激波，它的阻力也急速上升。同等大小形状的飞机当速度从每小时六百公里增加到一千二百公里时，速度虽只增加到原先的二倍，而阻力却为前者的三十二倍。因此，建造超声速的飞机更加需要功率强大而体积小重量轻的发动机。这一点又使过去在马力和重量比例上显得非常优越的内燃机落伍了！新的喷气式发动机代替了内燃机。喷气速度是每秒三分之八公里，即二公里七弱。
    可以毫不夸张地说，没有喷气发动机便没有今天的宇宙火箭。螺旋桨发动机是靠拨动周围空气产生反作用力前进的。但是，在大气层以外没有空气，螺旋桨也失掉了它的作用。没有喷气发动机要想使火箭冲出地球引力场是不可想像的。
    现在人类虽然掌握了第一宇宙速度和第二宇宙速度，后一速度比起人们走路的速度提高了八千多倍，比起七十多年前飞机的最高速度也提高了一千多倍，但这还远不是人类理想的速度。人类还要努力掌握第三宇宙速度，以便冲出太阳系，还要用更高得多的速度飞向别的“太阳系”，飞向广漠无垠的大宇宙。因此，继续力争高速度，仍然是科学工作者的迫切任务。我们知道，用获得第一、第二宇宙速度的多级化学燃料火箭还可能提高到每秒十六公里的第三宇宙速度。但是，化学燃料火箭却不能适应远程和长期的宇宙飞行。因此，离子火箭、核能火箭、光子火箭便成为人们进一步提高飞行速度的研究的对象。利用离子火箭人们估计可以得到每秒三、四十公里的速度。如果利用核能，据计算一级火箭可以达到每秒八公里的第一宇宙速度，再加上两级液体燃料火箭便可以获得更高的速度。光子火箭可以把火箭加速到接近光速（例如每秒二十万公里）的速度。从目前的技术水平说，离子火箭及核能火箭的实现将不是很遥远的事，也许用不到十年的时间。光子火箭的实现，从目前来说，还有很多困难等待克服。可以肯定地说，不久的将来，在宇宙飞行方面人类会获得比过去几年更伟大的成就。
