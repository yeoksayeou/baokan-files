Xinhua News Agency, London, January 10th: According to statistics published by the Manchester-based "Trade Overview," an average of two cotton textile factories in Britain closed down every week in 1958.

The number of workers in the cotton textile industry decreased by more than 30,000 in 1958.

The British cotton textile industry, which once dominated the world, has not been able to recover to its pre-war production levels since the war. In recent years, its production decline has accelerated, and the situation in 1958 was particularly serious. According to reports, the number of spindles in the British cotton textile industry has fallen from 40 million in 1937 to 15 million. The output of single yarn has fallen from 26.48 million pounds per week to 15.25 million pounds, and the output of cotton cloth has fallen from 70 million yards to less than 25 million yards (based on figures from the end of September last year).

    英国棉纺织业危机严重
    去年平均每周有两家工厂倒闭
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：据曼彻斯特出版的“贸易综览”所发表的统计材料，英国在1958年平均每星期有两家棉纺织厂倒闭。
    棉纺织业的工人在1958年减少了三万人以上。
    一度称雄世界的英国棉纺织业，在战后以来一直没有能够恢复到战前的生产水平。在最近几年里，它的生产衰退加速了，而1958年的情况尤其严重。据报道，目前英国棉纺织业的纱锭已经由1937年的四千万锭下降到了一千五百万锭；单根纱的产量已经由当年每周二千六百四十八万磅下降到了一千五百二十五万磅，棉布产量由七千万码下降到了不到二千五百万码（根据去年9月底的数字）。
