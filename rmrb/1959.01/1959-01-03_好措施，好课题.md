Good Measures, Good Subject
Hua Ren

The Fuan Prefectural Committee and other departments have made specific regulations for cadres sent to lower levels, deciding that cadres sent to lower levels should work as cooks and childcare workers in people's communes during their labor training. This regulation is a good measure for leaders and a good subject for cadres sent to lower levels.

It's a good measure because it is proposed at the right time.

The establishment of people's communes has brought a new and important issue, which is to learn how to manage large-scale collective affairs, to manage the eating and resting problems of hundreds of millions of peasants, and the collective education of hundreds of millions of children. This is a glorious and arduous task. At present, we do not have experience in managing such a large collective. We must learn to manage it well, otherwise, it will not only affect the lives of the masses but also directly affect the greater leap forward in production. This issue is one of the important links in consolidating the commune at present, and we must grasp this link.

Sending cadres to the communes to serve as cooks and childcare workers, first, can strengthen the collective life management work of the communes, enable the communes to quickly consolidate in this regard, and at the same time, gain a relatively complete set of experience in collective life management, which can be promoted throughout the county and prefecture. This is a good method. Second, caring for the lives of the masses, although it is a fine tradition of our party, today we must manage the large-scale affairs of hundreds of millions of peasants, even managing eating and children. This is a new subject. Our cadres must learn this skill, which is an indispensable part of leadership work. Sending cadres to the communes to work as cooks and childcare workers will enable cadres to learn this unfamiliar but important work. This is a good way to train cadres at present. Third, at present, some working people have a misconception that the management of collective life is not as important as production work and political work. In particular, some women, who used to revolve around the stove, are now finally liberated from housework and are unwilling to manage housework, cook, or take care of children. They do not realize that housework has always been very important; only because in the past, housework was scattered in various families, and in a class society where women were oppressed, housework did not receive due evaluation, and people looked down on women who did housework, forming the misconception that housework was inferior. In fact, housework is a noble task. Let us imagine, if no one manages housework, no one cooks, no one takes care of children, what would society become? Housework (including some scattered housework) must be regarded as an important task in the social division of labor. Especially today, we have started large-scale collective affairs, and we want to cook for hundreds or thousands of people, and take care of children for hundreds or thousands of families. Isn't this a work with greater significance? To do this work well, there is still a lot to learn, such as hygiene knowledge, nutrition knowledge, and child psychology knowledge. At present, some people's views of belittling housework cannot be changed for a while, so they also feel that the work of cooks and childcare workers is not important. Assigning cadres to do these jobs will quickly change people's views and will encourage more people who are more suitable for these jobs to bravely do these jobs well.

In the past year, we have had millions of cadres sent to the countryside to eat, live, and work with the peasants, leaving a deep impression on the peasants and greatly promoting practical work. I believe that comrades sent to commune canteens and nurseries will achieve greater victories! (Attached picture)

### 好措施，好课题

    好措施，好课题
    华仁
    福安地委等部门，对下放干部作出了具体规定，决定下放干部在劳动锻炼期间，要到人民公社去当炊事员和保育员。这一规定，对领导来说，是一个好措施；对下放干部来说，是一个好课题。
    说它是个好措施，是因为它提得适时。
    人民公社的建立，带来了一个新的重要问题，那就是要学会管理大家务，要把亿万农民的吃饭问题，休息问题，亿万孩子的集体教育问题管起来。这是个光荣而又艰巨的任务。目前，我们对管理这样一个大家务还没有经验。我们必须学会把它管好，不然的话，它不仅会影响群众的生活，还会直接影响着生产的更大跃进。这个问题是当前巩固公社的重要环节之一，我们必须抓住这一环。
    把干部下放公社去担任炊事员、保育员，第一，它可以使公社的集体生活管理工作加强，使公社在这方面能很快地巩固起来，同时可以取得一套比较完整的集体生活管理工作的经验，在全县、全专区推广，这是一个好办法。第二，关心群众生活，虽是我们党的优良传统，但是我们今天要管的是亿万农民的大家务，连吃饭、孩子都要管。这却是一个新的课题。我们的干部必须学会这套本领，这是领导工作不可缺少的一环。把干部下放到公社当炊事员、保育员，就会使干部学会这一生疏而又重要的工作。这是当前培养干部的好办法。第三，目前，在部分劳动人民中有一种错觉，他们以为集体生活的管理工作不如生产工作、政治工作重要。特别是有些妇女，她们原来围着锅台转，现在好容易从家务中解脱出来，不愿再去管家务、作饭、带孩子。她们没有认识到，家务工作从来就是很重要的工作；只因为过去家务工作分散在各个家庭里，并且在妇女受压迫的阶级社会里，家务工作没有得到应有的估价，人们看不起干家务的妇女，形成了家务工作低人一头的错误观念。其实家务工作是一项崇高的工作。让我们设想一下，如果没有人来管家务，没有人作饭，没有人带孩子，那么社会会变成什么样子呢？必须把家务（包括一部分分散的家务）工作看做是社会分工中的一项重要工作。特别是今天，我们办起了大家务，我们要给上百上千的人做饭，给上百上千家人管孩子，这不是一项有更大意义的工作吗？要作好这项工作，还要有很多学问，如卫生知识、营养知识、儿童心理知识等。目前，有些人轻视家务工作的看法一时还转不过来，因而炊事员和保育员的工作也觉得不重要，把下放干部分配去作这些工作，会迅速地改变人们的观点，并且会激励更多的更适合作这些工作的人勇于去作好这些工作。
    在过去的一年中，我们有百万干部下放到农村，和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，给农民留下了深刻的印象，对实际工作，也起了极大的推动作用。相信下放到公社食堂和托儿所的同志，一定会取得更大的胜利！（附图片）
