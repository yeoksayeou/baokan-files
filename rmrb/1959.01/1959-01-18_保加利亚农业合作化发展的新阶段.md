New Stage of Agricultural Cooperation Development in Bulgaria
George Vlahov, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee

The socialist transformation of agriculture in Bulgaria has been successfully completed. Large-scale collective agricultural economies have eloquently demonstrated their superiority over small-scale individual peasant economies.

The collectivization of our country was completed on the basis of already formed historical and economic conditions, usually with the establishment of a cooperative in each village. Therefore, in addition to large cooperatives, many small cooperatives were also established, with a total of several thousand decares (each decare is equal to one and a half Chinese mu).

By the end of 1956, among the three thousand and fifteen agricultural cooperatives, nine hundred and thirty-four cooperatives had six thousand or fewer decares of land, seven hundred and forty-eight cooperatives had six thousand to ten thousand decares of land, eight hundred cooperatives had ten thousand to eighteen thousand decares of land, and five hundred and thirty-three cooperatives had more than eighteen thousand decares of land. Between 1957 and 1958, more than four hundred new cooperatives were established, most of which were in mountainous or semi-mountainous areas, thus increasing the number of cooperatives with less than ten thousand decares of cultivated land.

The experience of agricultural cooperatives, as well as the experience of Soviet collective farm construction, shows that small collective economies have limited possibilities for increasing agricultural production and reducing production costs. Precisely for this reason, three or four years ago, at the initiative of the cooperative members themselves and local Party, state, and economic workers, the merger of some small cooperatives in individual regions of the country began, and the effectiveness of the mergers has been well reflected in the smooth development and rapid consolidation of these cooperatives. Other cooperatives have also welcomed the mergers with great interest. These cooperative mergers have been highly praised and supported by the Bulgarian Communist Party.

Not long ago, our country launched a mass movement to merge agricultural cooperatives. The merger of agricultural production cooperatives was successfully completed in a short period of time. The past three thousand four hundred cooperatives have been merged into six hundred and forty cooperatives, with an average of 70,000 decares of cultivated land per cooperative.

The merger of agricultural cooperatives is a new stage in the development of the socialist cooperative system in rural Bulgaria.

Wherein lies the superiority of the expanded agricultural cooperatives?

The expansion of cooperatives creates more favorable conditions for the correct combination of various economic sectors of the cooperative, for the more complete utilization of land and labor, and for the development of highly commercialized economies in various sectors of the cooperative. Cooperatives with a total of five or six thousand or ten thousand decares of land often lack appropriate conditions for integrating various economic sectors and adopting correct crop rotation systems. It is often the case that a certain cooperative mainly develops field planting, but animal husbandry develops very poorly due to insufficient pastureland, even if grain feed is abundant; however, a neighboring cooperative, although possessing vast pastureland, cannot develop animal husbandry due to insufficient grain feed production. There are also other situations: some cooperatives cannot guarantee that all members have work to do, while neighboring cooperatives face certain difficulties in some tasks due to labor shortages during certain seasons. After several adjacent agricultural cooperatives are merged into one, the land area is expanded, these difficulties and shortcomings can be eliminated, and better conditions are created for the coordinated development of various economic sectors and the rapid increase in agricultural production.

The expansion of agricultural cooperatives also enables the rapid development and consolidation of the public economy. The merged cooperatives possess a large amount of public accumulation funds, which can be used to build irrigation systems and projects, reclaim new land, rapidly develop forestry and intensive crops, and ensure the continuous growth of members' income on this basis.

In the merged agricultural cooperatives, favorable conditions are already in place to improve labor productivity and reduce product costs by more fully utilizing existing machinery, implementing comprehensive mechanization in animal husbandry and crop cultivation, adopting advanced experience and agricultural scientific achievements, and reducing non-productive labor and capital expenditures.

With the merger of agricultural cooperatives, the leadership work of the cooperatives has also been greatly improved, and the promotion of good cadres with rich experience in economic and organizational work to the positions of chairmen, Party secretaries, or other leadership positions of agricultural cooperatives plays a significant role in the upsurge of our entire socialist agriculture.

Now, our country has launched a nationwide movement to complete the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in a shortened period of time. Whether it is a factory, an agricultural cooperative, or a machine tractor station, specific measures have been set to tap new potential to increase production.

The expansion of agricultural cooperatives enables our country to maximize the huge potential of socialist agriculture, increase agricultural production, reduce costs, and enable the Five-Year Plan to be completed in a shortened time frame. (Translated by Wu Chuanduo) (Attached picture)

    保加利亚农业合作化发展的新阶段
    保加利亚共产党中央农业部副部长　乔治·弗拉吉柯夫
    保加利亚农业的社会主义改造顺利地完成了。大型的集体农业经济雄辩地证明了它对个体小农经济的优越性。
    我们国家的合作化是在已经形成的历史和经济条件的基础上完成的，通常是每一个村子成立一个合作社。因此除了大型的合作社外，也建立了许多小型的合作社，这些小型合作社总共拥有几千狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合中国的一亩半）的土地。
    到1956年底，在三千零十五个农业合作社中间，拥有六千或不到六千狄卡尔土地的合作社有九百三十四个，拥有六千到一万狄卡尔土地的合作社有七百四十八个，拥有一万到一万八千狄卡尔土地的合作社有八百个，拥有一万八千狄卡尔以上的土地的合作社有五百三十三个。在1957年和1958年间，建立了四百多个新的合作社，这些社大都是在山区或半山区，因而拥有一万狄卡尔以下耕地面积的合作社的数量增加了。
    农业合作社的经验，以及苏联集体农庄建设的经验表明，小型集体经济在增加农业生产和降低生产成本方面的可能性是有限的。正因如此，在三、四年以前，根据合作社员自己以及地方党、国家和经济工作人员的倡议，开始把国内个别地区一些不大的合作社合并，并社的成效已经在这些合作社的顺利发展和迅速巩固上很好地反映出来。其他的合作社也以极大的兴趣来迎接并社。这些合作社的合并，得到了保加利亚共产党的高度评价和支持。
    不久以前，我国展开了合并农业合作社的群众性运动。农业生产合作社的合并在短期内就胜利地完成了。过去三千四百多个社已合并为六百四十个，平均每一个合作社的耕地面积为七万狄卡尔。
    农业合作社的合并是保加利亚农村社会主义合作社制度发展的新阶段。
    扩大了的农业合作社的优越性在哪里呢？
    合作社的扩大，为合作社各种经济部门的正确结合，为土地和劳动力更加充分的利用，为合作社各部门的和高度商品性的经济的发展，创造了更加有利的条件。总共拥有五、六千或一万狄卡尔土地的合作社，在使各经济部门相互结合与采用正确的轮种制方面往往缺乏适当的条件。常有这样的情况：某个合作社主要发展田间种植业，但是，畜牧业由于牧场不够，即使谷物饲料十分充足也发展得很差；但邻近的一个合作社，虽然拥有辽阔的牧场，而由于谷物饲料生产不足，畜牧业也不能得到发展。还有另外一些情况：某些合作社不能保证所有的社员有活干，而邻近的合作社却在一定季节由于劳动力紧张而给某些工作造成一定的困难。若干个毗邻的农业合作社合而为一以后，土地面积扩大了，这些困难和缺点也就可能得到消除，并为协调地发展各种经济部门，急速地增加农业生产，创造更好的条件。
    农业合作社的扩大也使得公有经济得到迅速的发展和巩固。合并了的合作社拥有大量的公积金，可以用来修建灌溉系统和工程，开垦新的土地，迅速发展造林和精耕作物，在这个基础上来保证社员收入的不断增长。
    在合并了的农业合作社里，已具备有利条件，通过更加充分的利用现有的机器，在畜牧业和植物种植业中实行综合机械化、采用先进经验和农业科学的成就、缩减非生产性劳动和资金的开支等途径，来提高劳动生产率，降低产品的成本。
    随着农业合作社的合并，合作社的领导工作也得到了很大的改善，把具有丰富经济工作和组织工作经验的好干部，提拔到农业合作社主席、党的书记或其他领导岗位上来，对我们整个社会主义农业的高涨，起着重大的作用。
    现在，我国已开展了全民性运动，争取在缩短的期限内完成第三个发展国民经济的五年计划。无论是工厂，农业合作社或机器拖拉机站，都定出了具体的措施，挖掘新的潜力来增加生产。
    农业合作社的扩大，使我国能够最大限度地利用社会主义农业的巨大潜力，提高农业生产，降低成本，使五年计划得以在缩短的时限内完成。（吴传铎译）（附图片）
