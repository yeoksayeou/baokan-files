Broaden Fertilizer Sources, Improve Fertilizer Efficiency, and Apply Fertilizer Rationally
Sichuan's Fertilizer Accumulation and Production Movement Reaches a New High Tide

    (Our report) Chengdu, Sichuan Province – Closely integrated with the field management of minor spring crops, Sichuan Province is vigorously carrying out a winter campaign of accumulating, producing, and applying fertilizer. Since December of last year, a wave of fertilizer accumulation has risen one after another across the province, with many prefectures and counties reaching an average of tens of thousands of jin of fertilizer per mu. More than 50 million mu of minor spring crops throughout the province have generally been top-dressed twice or more.

    Many places have strengthened leadership over fertilizer accumulation work from the start, combining the organization of professional forces with the large-scale mass movement, yielding very significant results. In Wanxian County's winter fertilizer accumulation effort, all communes and teams in the county established fertilizer accumulation professional teams, restored and established more than 700 fertilizer plants, and continuously launched several mass blitz campaigns for fertilizer accumulation. In the county, a total of more than 23 billion jin of natural fertilizer and native chemical fertilizer was accumulated in the most recent month, averaging 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. There are now more than 100,000 commune-run native chemical fertilizer plants throughout the province.

    Another characteristic of Sichuan's fertilizer accumulation this year is the broadening of fertilizer sources. According to statistics from some prefectures, tens of thousands of raw materials that can be used to make native chemical fertilizers have been discovered. Currently, there are more than 100 kinds of native chemical fertilizers, granular fertilizers, and bacterial fertilizers made from various natural minerals and waste materials, containing large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Some places, in conjunction with hygiene campaigns and water conservancy construction, mobilized the masses to find them in the mountains, pick them from trees, shovel them from the ground, and scoop them from the water, ensuring that fertilizer accumulation penetrates everywhere. In the work of fertilizer accumulation, various places also paid attention to accumulating and producing fertilizers according to the different fertilizer needs of crops during their growth period.

    Accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, and applying fertilizer simultaneously, with a set of fertilizer accumulation personnel combining these three aspects, saves time and effort. Nanchong, Mianyang and other prefectures widely adopted the method of accumulating fertilizer locally, producing fertilizer locally, and using fertilizer locally, which greatly improved work efficiency.

    Currently, the province's fertilizer accumulation movement is further moving towards a new high tide, accumulating fertilizer for minor spring crops while also preparing for major spring crops. In areas where work is progressing well, a province-wide fertilizer accumulation movement has emerged. Recently, government organizations, schools, and residents in Jingyan County have launched a wave of native chemical fertilizer production; the people in some towns and cities have also participated in fertilizer accumulation work.

    广开肥源　提高肥效　合理施肥
    四川积肥造肥运动走向新高潮
    本报讯　四川省各地紧密结合小春作物田间管理，正在大力开展冬季积肥、造肥、施肥运动。去年12月以来，全省积肥热潮此起彼伏，许多专区和县已达到平均每亩有几万斤肥料。全省五千多万亩小春作物已普遍追肥两次以上。
    许多地方一开始就加强了积肥工作的领导，使组织专业大军和大搞群众运动相结合，收效十分显著。万县在冬季积肥中，全县社社队队都建立了积肥专业队，恢复和建立了七百多个肥料厂，连续开展了几次群众性的突击积肥运动，全县最近一个月中积自然肥和造土化肥共二百三十多亿斤，平均每亩有肥三万斤。全省的社办土化肥厂已有十万个以上。
    四川省今年积肥的另一个特点是广开肥源。据部分专区统计，已发现可制土化肥的原料有几万种。目前，利用各种自然矿物和废物制成的土化肥、颗粒肥和细菌肥有一百多种，这些肥料含有大量氮、磷、钾。有些地方结合卫生运动和兴修水利，发动群众在山里找、树上摘、地面铲、水里捞，做到积肥无孔不入。在积肥工作中，各地还注意了根据作物生长期需要不同的肥料来积肥造肥。
    边积肥、边造肥、边施肥，一套积肥人马三面结合，这样做省时又省力。南充、绵阳等专区广泛采用就地积肥、就地造肥、就地使用的办法，大大提高了工效。
    目前，全省积肥运动正进一步走向新的高潮，在为小春积肥同时也为大春作物做好准备。开展好的地区已出现全民积肥运动。井研县城镇机关、学校、居民最近掀起造土化肥热潮；有些地方的城镇人民也参加了积肥工作。（于竞祁）
