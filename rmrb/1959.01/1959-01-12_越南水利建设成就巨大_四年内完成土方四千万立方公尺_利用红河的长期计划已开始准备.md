Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 11th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, from 1955 to 1958, the earthwork completed in North Vietnam for constructing and reinforcing dikes reached 40 million cubic meters. This figure is equal to the total amount of earthwork completed during the twenty years of French colonial rule.

This was stated by Vietnamese Minister of Water Conservancy Tran Dang Khoa in a report delivered at the National Water Conservancy Conference, which is currently being held in Hanoi.

Tran Dang Khoa said that from the beginning of 1956 to the middle of 1958, the Vietnamese people dug nearly 19,000 kilometers of irrigation canals, built 5.78 million cubic meters of revetment walls, and spent more than 4.2 million workdays irrigating farmland.

Since the restoration of peace, twelve large-scale water conservancy projects destroyed by the French colonialists during the war of aggression have been restored, and six new projects have been built.

Tran Dang Khoa emphasized that in the struggle against natural disasters, the Vietnamese people have demonstrated great labor enthusiasm and infinite creativity. In early 1956, severe droughts occurred throughout Vietnam, but through the hard work of the people, the disasters were finally overcome. A bumper harvest was also achieved last summer after overcoming drought. Currently, during the winter and spring planting, farmers are responding to the government's call to prepare for the possible drought.

Tran Dang Khoa also said that the preparation work for a long-term plan to utilize the Red River has begun.

    越南水利建设成就巨大
    四年内完成土方四千万立方公尺
    利用红河的长期计划已开始准备
    新华社河内11日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南北部从1955年到1958年期间，在修建和加固堤岸方面的土方达四千万立方公尺，这个数字等于法国殖民主义者统治时期二十年中所完成的土方总和。
    这是越南水利部长陈登科在全国水利会议上作报告时说的。会议现在正在河内举行。
    陈登科说，从1956年年初到1958年年中，越南人民开凿了近一万九千公里灌溉渠，修建了五百七十八万立方公尺的护堤壁，并且用四百二十万多个工作日灌溉农田。
    自从和平恢复以来，已经恢复了法国殖民主义者在侵略战争中所破坏的十二个巨大的水利工程，另外还修建了六个新工程。
    陈登科强调说，在反对自然灾害的斗争中，越南人民表现了巨大的劳动热情和无穷的创造力。在1956年初，越南各地发生了严重旱灾，但是经过人民的苦战，终于克服了灾害。去年夏季也是在战胜旱灾以后获得丰收的。目前，在冬春的播种中，农民们正响应政府的号召，准备同可能发生的旱灾进行斗争。
    陈登科还说，利用红河的长期计划的准备工作已经开始。
