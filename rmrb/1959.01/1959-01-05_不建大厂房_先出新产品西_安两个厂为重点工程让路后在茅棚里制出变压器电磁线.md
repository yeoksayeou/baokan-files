Xi'an, January 4th (report from this newspaper) – The Xi'an Cable Factory and Xi'an Transformer Factory, in their preparatory work, both actively yielded to key projects and actively sought ways to leap forward. These two factories, without their construction projects being scheduled, mobilized all employees to start from scratch, manufacture complete sets of indigenous equipment in thatched sheds, and produce new products such as transformers and enamelled wire.

The Xi'an Cable Factory and Xi'an Transformer Factory were originally planned to start construction in the second half of 1958, complete part of the factory buildings before the end of the year, and begin trial production of new products. Since the Great Leap Forward, the number of construction projects in Shaanxi Province has increased significantly, making it difficult to meet the demand for building materials and construction manpower all at once. In order to ensure key industrial construction, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the principle of prioritizing urgent projects, queued up the basic construction projects. At that time, neither of the two factories was scheduled, and some employees had opinions, feeling discouraged that they were not scheduled and could not leap forward while others were. In order to overcome the negative emotions among the employees, the Party branches of these two factories launched a debate on the question of "Should we guarantee key projects?" Through the debate, the employees clearly realized that only when metallurgy, machinery and other marshals go up first, will the state have more materials and equipment to build more new factories; giving way is to speed up the construction. Then, they led the employees to discuss whether they could leap forward after giving way, and how to leap forward. They analyzed the various favorable and unfavorable conditions of the factory. They unanimously agreed that the products of these two factories are urgently needed in the current construction, and that there are engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers supported by the old factories. The material problems can also be solved with the support and help of the local Party committee and brother factories. The final conclusion was: Relying on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilizing the masses can create conditions for building factories.

The leap forward plan of the employees of these two factories immediately received the support and encouragement of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. With the help of the Municipal Committee, they absorbed several street-level small repair factories, and then launched a mass movement to arm themselves throughout the factory. From leaders to workers, from technicians to apprentices, all participated in this movement. In order to arm themselves, the employees of the Xi'an Cable Factory decided to produce forty-eight sets of indigenous equipment before the end of the year, including complete sets of indigenous machines such as enamelling machines, yarn wrapping machines, large drawing machines, medium drawing machines, plastic machines, flattening machines, stranding machines, and rewinding machines. However, apart from some scrap steel allocated by the state, there were no materials. So they tried to solve the material problem. Some veteran workers found some old gears, shafts, and shaft tiles at scrap steel recycling stations as parts for indigenous equipment; some employees, with the help of local governments, bought some old wood from people's communes or timber processing plants to make machine bodies and parts. Without factory buildings, the employees worked in the open air or in dormitories, and also built more than 2,600 square meters of thatched sheds. In this way, they made more than a dozen sets of indigenous equipment such as die machines, medium drawing machines, enamelling machines, and stranding machines. After testing, these devices performed well and could completely replace foreign equipment for production. They are manufacturing more than thirty sets of indigenous equipment and installing their own indigenous machines in indigenous factory buildings to begin trial production of new products. The employees of the Xi'an Transformer Factory also borrowed an unfinished factory building from the Xi'an High-Voltage Switch Factory as a temporary factory building. They overcame the difficulties of materials and equipment in trial-producing new products and produced three 320,000 kVA transformers.

    安两个厂为重点工程让路后在茅棚里制出变压器电磁线
    本报西安4日电　西安电缆厂和西安变压器厂在筹建工作中，既主动给重点工程让路，又积极想办法跃进。这两个厂在建厂工程没有排上队的情况下，发动全体职工，白手起家，在茅棚里制造出成套的土设备，并生产出变压器和电磁线等新产品。
    西安电缆厂和西安变压器厂原计划在1958年下半年开始建设，年底前建成部分厂房并开始试制新产品。大跃进以来，陕西省建设项目增加很多，建筑材料和施工力量很难一下满足。为了保证重点工业建设，中共陕西省委根据轻重缓急的原则，对基本建设项目进行了排队。当时，这两个厂都没有排上队，有些职工有意见，有人感到没排上队很泄气，觉得别人都在大跃进，自己就不能跃进了。为了克服职工中存在的消极情绪，这两个厂的党支部对
  “应不应该保证重点”的问题，发动职工进行了一场辩论。通过辩论，职工们明确认识到只有让冶金、机械等元帅上去以后，国家才有更多的材料和设备建设更多的新厂；让路是为了加快建设速度。接着，又领导职工对让路后能不能跃进，如何跃进的问题又展开了讨论。他们分析了工厂的各种有利条件和不利因素。一致认为这两个厂的产品都是目前建设中迫切需要的产品，都有老厂支援的工程技术人员和老工人，材料问题，也可以在地方党委和兄弟厂的支持和帮助下求得解决。最后的结论是：依靠党的领导、充分发动群众，就可以为建厂创造条件。
    这两个厂职工的跃进计划马上得到了中共西安市委的支持和鼓励。在市委的帮助下，他们吸收了几个街道小型修配工厂，接着又在全厂范围内开展了自己武装自己的群众运动，从领导到工人，从技术人员到学徒，都投入了这个运动。西安电缆厂的职工们为了自己武装自己，决定年底前生产出四十八台土设备，其中包括漆包机、纱包机、大拉机、中拉机、塑料机、压扁机、绞线机、复绕机等全套土机器。但是除了国家调拨的一些废钢铁外，什么材料也没有，于是又想办法解决材料问题。有些老工人在废钢铁收购站找到了一些旧齿轮、轴和轴瓦等作为土设备的零件；有些职工在地方政府的帮助下，到人民公社或木材加工厂买到了一些旧木料用来制造机身和零件。没有厂房，职工们就在露天或宿舍内工作，还建设了二千六百多平方公尺的茅棚。就这样他们制出了孔模机、中拉机、漆包机、绞线机等十几台土设备。经过试验，这些设备性能良好，完全可以代替洋设备进行生产。他们正在制造三十多台土设备，并在土厂房里安装自己制造的土机器，开始试制新产品。西安变压器厂职工也借用西安高压开关厂一个没有完工的厂房作为临时厂房，在试制新产品时克服了材料和设备的困难，生产出三台三百二千千伏安的变压器。
