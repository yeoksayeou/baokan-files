    Steelmaking Also Refines People
    Ba Na
    On September 13, 1958, the first batch of molten iron flowed out of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Blast Furnace! Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace is a state-of-the-art furnace. With the valiant efforts of the steel warriors and the support from all over the country, this blast furnace was built with the highest speed and the best quality! What an exciting event! This glorious fact has already been reflected in artistic works. Not long ago, we saw the documentary "Iron Flowers in Full Bloom," and now we see the play "Sparks from the Blast Furnace."
    "Sparks from the Blast Furnace" writes about what happened in the welding section of the metal structure of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace. The characters are mostly electric welders. Although it writes about the events in one section, it can be seen that the construction of this blast furnace was not smooth sailing, but involved contradictions and struggles. Some senior workers, headed by the section chief, opposed the participation of junior workers in welding. They believed that female welder Gao Lanxing was like "a hen trying to crow," and she was simply not suitable for high-altitude operations. They would rather work overtime themselves than give these young people opportunities to practice and learn; however, this approach was opposed by the Party branch secretary, Tian Ziliang, who proposed that novices must be cultivated and improved in their work, that steelmaking also refines people. Therefore, the entire play, while portraying how the workers worked tirelessly to build the blast furnace, also runs through the red line of the struggle between advanced and conservative ideas.
    Under the leadership and support of the Party, the junior workers displayed a spirit of daring to think and daring to do. After diligent study and hard work, they finally grew into skilled workers. They, along with all the workers, undertook the arduous task of building the blast furnace and successfully completed it; and in the face of such facts, the section chief was also educated and changed his views.
    The play also interspersed some comedic plots, such as the depiction of that British reporter. This foreigner was so arrogant and self-important at first, shaking his head at this and doubting that, naturally even less believing that our No. 1 Blast Furnace could be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. On the day the blast furnace produced iron, he came again. In order not to lose face in front of the workers, he put on a pair of glasses, changed his clothes, and pretended to be French. But this ultimately could not deceive the workers' eyes! When the people on stage were mocking him, the audience off stage couldn't help but laugh out loud.
    Currently, there are not many plays about steel workers. The appearance of "Sparks from the Blast Furnace" can be said to be a welcome sign. If this play were written in a more focused and refined manner, and the character portrayals were strengthened, it would be even more moving.
    In 1958, we achieved unparalleled brilliant victories on the steel front. How many exciting events occurred, and how many heroic figures emerged! We hope that playwrights will write more plays reflecting the steel front to inspire people and to cheer for even greater leaps forward this year!

    炼钢也炼人
    巴娜
    1958年9月13日那天，武汉钢铁公司一号高炉流出了第一炉铁水！武钢一号高炉是最新型的高炉，在钢铁战士们的奋战下，在全国各方面的支援下，这座高炉以最高的速度、最优等的质量建成了！这是多么激动人心的事啊！这个光辉的事实已经在艺术作品中反映出来了。不久前，我们看到了纪录片“铁花怒放”，现在我们又看到了话剧“高炉火花”。
    “高炉火花”写的是发生在武钢一号高炉炉体金属结构的焊接工段上的事，出场的人物大都是电焊工人。虽然写的是一个工段上的事，但从中也可以看出，建成这座高炉并不是一帆风顺，而是有矛盾斗争的。以工段长为首的一些高级工反对初级工参加焊接，对于女电焊工高兰星更认为是“母鸡学打鸣”，根本不能参加高空作业，他们宁肯自己加班加点，也不给这些年青人锻炼学习的机会；但是，这种做法受到党支部书记田自亮的反对，他提出必须在工作中培养提高新手，炼钢也炼人。因此整个戏在表现工人们如何努力不懈建成高炉的同时，也贯穿着先进思想对保守思想进行的斗争红线。
    在党的领导和支持下，初级工们发挥了敢想敢干的精神，经过苦学苦炼，终于成长为熟练工人。他们和所有工人一道，承担起了建设高炉的艰巨任务，并且胜利地完成了；而在这样的事实面前，工段长也受到了教育，改变了自己的看法。
    剧中还穿插了一些喜剧情节，比如对于那个英国记者的描写。这个外国人开始时是那么趾高气扬，不可一世，对这也摇头，对那也怀疑，自然更不相信我们的一号高炉能够如期或提前建成罗。在高炉出铁那天，他又来了。为了不让自己在工人面前丢脸，他加上了一副眼镜，改变了服饰，把自己说成是法国人。不过这到底蒙蔽不了工人们的眼睛！当台上的人在嘲弄他的时候，台下的观众也不禁哈哈大笑起来了。
    目前，写钢铁工人的话剧还不太多，“高炉火花”的出现可说是一个可喜的先兆，如果这个戏写得集中精炼一些，人物形象的塑造更加强一些，会更感动人的。
    1958年，我们在钢铁战线上取得了无比辉煌的胜利，出现了多少激动人心的事迹、涌现了多少英雄人物啊！我们希望剧作家们多写点反映钢铁战线的戏，来鼓舞人们，来为今年更大的跃进助威！
