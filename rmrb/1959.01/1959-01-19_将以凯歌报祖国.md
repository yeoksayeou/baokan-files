Ten thousand miles of morning glow, the rising sun ascends. The grassland giant—the towering body of Baotou Steel’s No. 1 Blast Furnace, stands before the Ulan Mountains, draped in golden sunlight. The massive No. 4 Coke Oven billows forth clouds of smoke edged with gold. The concrete structure of the “King of Open Hearths” construction site stands like a steel-cast city wall. Colorful flags, lion dances, dragon dances, and flower basket teams flow with song and dance along the steel street adorned with poems and paintings.

The builders of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base, having overfulfilled their 1958 tasks, now sing battle songs and march forward into the even more glorious ranks of the battle for 18 million tons of steel!

1958, this year of the Great Leap Forward that shook human history, the builders of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are changing the face of the borderlands at the speed of light. Even the greatest romantic poet would find it difficult to imagine such a realm filled with wondrous brilliance. In the past, people often depicted golden halos behind the heads of gods and Buddhas to symbolize the light of wisdom, but the desolation of the grasslands remained unchanged. However, in the hands of the people today, the ancient barren mountain of Bayan Obo, barren for billions of years, has been transformed into a precious crown strung with thousands upon thousands of night-shining pearls. At night, a beautiful halo appears in the sky behind Bayan Obo Mountain. Herdsmen near the mine have electric lights, like the Ziwei Star flying into the ancient Mongolian yurts.

The Yellow River, which has been difficult to tame for thousands of years, will be transformed into clear water according to people's will under the conquest of tens of thousands of water conservancy heroes, diverted northward to the foot of the Ulan Mountains, serving Baotou Steel.

Baotou Steel is one of China's largest and most modern iron and steel bases. It is being built in an ancient border region with a small population and no industrial base. To build a world-class iron and steel base in such an area is a daunting task. But those builders under the leadership of the Party are changing the grasslands at a speed of one day equaling twenty years. The borderlands—where ancient heroes once sang of "a desolate view of mountains and rivers"—now are like dough in the hands of a dough figurine maker, allowing the builders' will to shape a magnificent and exquisite work of art: a city of steel.

The construction site of No. 1 Blast Furnace, which marks the birth of Baotou Steel, is simply a launch site for "satellites." The eagles of the No. 2 Team of the Metal Structure Company, without any modern installation equipment, used a few seamless steel pipes to install a 70-meter-high, 40-ton giant tower crane in 30 days, 70 days faster than brother units with modern installation equipment. This is the success of the "self-installation, self-hoisting" plan of veteran workers Zhan Derong and Zhu Xiaoxian. This crane could originally only rotate 270 degrees, and designers and technical experts were sure that this congenital defect could not be changed. However, young worker Yu Changyu simply wrapped the turntable rope one more time, and 270 degrees became 450 degrees.

The installation of No. 1 Blast Furnace encountered numerous difficulties, such as insufficient equipment, uncoordinated other projects, and the inability of tower cranes to pass through. With the assistance of brother units, the workers of the No. 2 Metal Structure Team installed nine rings of this behemoth in twelve days. According to regular operations, after nine rings, installation cannot continue without pallet supports, but these supports simply could not arrive. At this time, they continued to install 19 rings with creative scientific methods. In this ingenious process, they created a fast construction method of leaving a feeding door in the first ring of the furnace body and blocking it only after six rings were installed. This pioneering blast furnace installation added a scientific data to future blast furnace construction.

On the installation of hot blast stoves, Zhang Xuejing, Shi Lianzhu, Sun Jian and other twenty-four young people released the reddest "satellites." They had only four qualified welders, and in two days they taught twenty people to master DC welding machines and use No. 42 welding rods. In seven days and sixteen hours, they installed two units in the cold winter rain of the borderlands. Then, in sixty-six hours, they installed the last one. These three furnace bodies, each weighing four to five hundred tons and with 1,500 meters of weld seams and over forty meters in height, could not be touched in the past without dozens of qualified welders and a construction period of two or three months.

This is the reddest speed of light. This is exquisite art in the history of steel.

Baotou Steel’s No. 1 Blast Furnace and its three hot blast stoves now stand majestically on the grassland. To its west, the magnificent No. 4 Coke Oven, having been heated six months ahead of schedule, emits the first blue smoke into the skies of the Ulan Mountains. They report to the headquarters of the 18 million tons of steel battle in high spirits: We are here!

"We are doing extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done." Encouraged by this great language, thousands of skilled craftsmen—master workers—who had suffered under the old era, under the leadership of the Party, opened training classes, served as instructors, and dedicated their spare time to train their successors. Master furnace builder Shi Junshan, for the coke oven project, brought forty young people and used ten days to teach them the furnace building technology he had learned from the age of fifteen to the present. The shaped bricks of a coke oven are truly varied. There are six or seven hundred numbers and six or seven hundred shapes. It's truly dazzling. He used the evenings to draw many diagrams as teaching materials. That day, I looked at a roll of beautifully drawn, precisely lined drawings and thought about how much effort and how many sleepless nights this old worker in his fifties, who could not read, had spent.

Master worker Sui Yongzhi, who once built factories and started trains with a pair of iron pliers, meticulously taught young people riveting technology. He taught young workers to first draw diagrams, then cut out the diagrams and align them to arouse their interest and understanding. These master workers regard training the younger generation as an supreme honor, without asking for any compensation or rewards. They said that with politics in command, technology is the decisive link. By doing this, we can send people wherever the Party needs them.

At the Baotou Iron and Steel Base, I often heard this sentence: "The people of the whole country are concerned about us and watching us! We must speed up and produce iron and steel as soon as possible!" Young all-rounder Liu Zhixiang realized semi-mechanization of automobile repair in the first half of last year, and will fully mechanize this year. The waste oil dripping from hundreds of automobiles at Baotou Steel, through his creation, was resurrected into seven kinds of oil, producing three tons per month, saving 40,000 yuan.

I heard Liu Zhixiang tell a story: Last year, when he was attending the National Youth Activists Congress in Beijing, he went to get a haircut one day. The barber asked him where he came from while working. He replied that he came from Inner Mongolia. The barber was not satisfied with his general answer and said, "Inner Mongolia is big. Have you been to Baotou?"

Liu Zhixiang apologized and said, "I came from Baotou."

The barber then asked, "Are you at Baotou Steel?"

"Yes, I am a worker at Baotou Steel."

"Baotou Steel?" The barber was happy. "When will you produce steel?"

"Soon, we can produce iron and steel next year."

"Hurry up, comrades, we are all watching you!"

Many people have encountered such concern. I have encountered it on trains and in hospitals. Advance ahead of schedule, accelerate the production of iron, steel, and steel materials; accelerate the production of special steels that the motherland does not yet have to repay the support and concern of the Party and the people! This is why the builders create selflessly and labor selflessly.

The prototype of the largest, and one of the world's rarest, crushing plant has been erected at the foot of Bayan Mountain. This reinforced concrete structure, which is more than 30 meters deep underground and more than 60 meters high, would have been completed long ago if the materials had kept up. The mine builders call the winding electric railway on the mountain "The Great Wall." The electric locomotives from Hunan anxiously cried out during the test run: "Hurry up with the sleepers!" In the future, in the places where giant boring machines have worked, next to the piles of iron ore crushed by blasters, electric shovels that can swallow four or six tons of ore at a single gulp will dump the ore onto electric train cars along the spine of "The Great Wall," and then pour the ore into the crushing plant, and then the ore will be transported through the transmission system to castle-like ore storage tanks, and then flow into trains passing through the vast Ulanqab grassland and transported to the foot of the Ulan Mountains, and transformed into rivers of molten iron with flying golden stars.

The Baotou Iron and Steel Base is being born. But this steel giant is to be born in a remote wilderness. It does not need two ordinary milk bottles or a few ordinary small shirts. It needs all kinds of parts, instruments, generators... For its birth, just to say the most ordinary screws, it is not one ton or ten tons, but more than a dozen large train cars!

I once climbed the blast furnace, which had been installed for nineteen rings, with Sun Jian, the deputy leader of the Youth Shock Team of the No. 2 Golden Knot, who is known as the Eagles. I asked him when it could be fully installed. He said:

"If the material supply keeps up, it will be fast!"

He was like a distant expedition soldier, waiting for reinforcements on the eve of a victorious decisive battle. He looked at the distant clouds and seemed to say: We are grateful for the support and concern of the motherland! But we urgently need ammunition in order to repay the motherland with triumphant songs sooner!

Now I understand: why the meetings at all levels here are praising matchmakers. In order to complete an important iron and steel base in our country, may there be no cruel mothers-in-law in the world and matchmakers everywhere! (Attached picture)

    将以凯歌报祖国
    阮辛竟
    朝霞万里，旭日高升。草原巨人——包钢一号高炉的高大炉体，披着金色的阳光立在乌拉山前。巨大的第四号焦炉，喷出朵朵滚着金边的烟云。“平炉之王”工地的混凝土结构，像钢铸的城墙矗立着。五色缤纷的彩旗、狮舞、龙舞、花篮队，载歌载舞流过满墙诗画的钢铁大街。
    包头钢铁基地的建设者们，超额完成了1958年的任务，现在高唱战歌，投入更光辉的一千八百万吨钢的战斗行列前进！
    1958，这个撼震人类历史的大跃进年中，在党和毛主席领导下的包头钢铁基地的建设者，如光的速度在改变着塞外的面貌。即使是最伟大的浪漫主义做诗家，也很难想像出如此充满奇光异彩的境界。过去，人们常以金色的光环，画在神佛的头背，以象征智慧之光，而草原的荒凉，却依然如故。然而在今天人们的手里，亿万年来的无树老荒山——白云鄂博，已经变成一顶以千颗万串夜明珠穿成的宝冠。夜晚白云鄂博的山后天穹上，出现着一轮绮丽光环。矿山附近的牧民，有了电灯，像紫微星飞进了古老的蒙古包。
    千古难驯的黄河，在成千上万的水源工程英雄们征服下将按照人们的意志变成清水，分流向北流到乌拉山下，为包钢服务。
    包钢，是我国最大最现代化的钢铁基地之一。它建设在一个人口少，完全没有工业基础的古塞外。要在这样的地区，建设一个世界第一流的钢铁基地，任务是艰巨的。但是那些在党领导下的建设者们，以一天等于二十年的速度改变着草原。塞外——这个古代英雄到此唱出“一望山河萧索”的地方，现在像在捏面人手里的面团，任从建设者的意志，捏出一个无比雄伟、无比精美的艺术——钢铁之城。
    标志着包钢诞生的一号高炉的工地上，简直是“卫星”的发射场。金属结构公司二队的雄鹰们，在完全没有现代化安装设备的条件下，用几根无缝钢管，在三十天中，把七十米高的四十吨巨型塔式吊车，安装起来。比有现代化安装设备的兄弟基地，快了七十天。这是老工人詹德荣、朱孝先的“自安自吊”方案的成功。这座吊车原来只能转二百七十度，设计家和技术专门家，肯定这是无法改动的先天性的缺点，然而，青年工人于长玉，只把转盘绳子多绕一圈，二百七十度就变成四百五十度。
    安装一号高炉，遇到了设备不足、其它工程配合不上、塔式吊车开不过来的重重困难。金属结构二队的工人们在兄弟单位的协助下，用十二天的时间把这个庞然大物，安装了九圈。按正规作业，九圈以后，没有托盘支柱是不能继续安装的，可是，这种支柱偏偏又来不了。这时，他们以创造性的科学方法，又继续安装了十九圈。在这个巧干的过程中，他们创造了第一圈炉体留个进料门，安好六圈才堵上的快速施工法。这个安装高炉的创举，给今后高炉施工添了一笔科学资料。
    在安装热风炉的工程上，张学敬、石连柱、孙健等二十四名青年，曾经放出了最红的“卫星”。他们只有四名合格的焊工，两天里就使二十人学会掌握直流电焊机和使用四十二号焊条。以七天又十六小时，在塞外冬季寒雨中，安装了两座。紧接着又以六十六个小时，把最后一座安装起来。这三座四五百吨重，焊缝一千五百公尺的各身高四十多公尺的炉体，过去没有几十名合格焊工和两三个月工期，是不敢动的。
    这是最红的光速。这是钢铁历史的精美艺术。
    包钢第一号高炉和它的三座热风炉，现在威武地立在草原上。在它的西边，雄伟的四号焦炉，已提前六个月烘炉，把第一阵蓝烟，吐在乌拉山的苍穹上。它们精神抖擞地向一千八百万吨钢的大本营报到：我来了！
    “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。在这句伟大语言鼓舞起来的、曾受尽旧时代压迫的上千个巧匠——老师傅，他们在党的领导下，开训练班，当教员，献出自己的业余时间，培养他们的接班人。筑炉工老师傅史俊山，为了焦炉工程，带着四十名青年，把自己从十五岁到现在学来的东西，用十天时间，使他们学会筑炉技术。一座焦炉的异形砖，真是千姿万态。号码有六七百，形状有六七百。真是使人看得眼花缭乱。他利用晚上，画下许多图样作教材。我那天看了他一卷绘着精美的、线条精确的图纸，想到一个五十多岁，不识字的老工人，不知花了多少心血，熬了多少个不眠的夜晚。
    曾经靠一把铁钳，把厂房盖起来，把火车开起来的老师傅隋永秩，细致认真地向青年人传授铆工技术，他教青年工人先画图样，然后把图样剪下再对正，使他们发生兴趣和了解。这些老师傅们把培养年青一代当做无上的荣誉，而不要任何报酬和奖赏。他们说，政治挂了帅，技术就是决定性的环节了，我们这样做，等党需要人到哪里，我们就能派出人到哪里。
    在包头钢铁基地上，我经常听到这样一句话：“全国人民都在关心我们，望着我们！要加快，要早日出铁出钢！”青年万能手刘志祥在去年上半年实现了修理汽车半机械化，今年要全部机械化。包钢几百部汽车滴下的废油，经过他的创造，复活为七种油，每月出三吨，节约四万元。
    我听刘志祥说过一个故事：去年，他在北京参加青年积极分子大会时，有天他去理发。理发师在工作的时候，问他从哪里来。他回答从内蒙古来。理发师不满意他笼统的回答，说：“内蒙古大了。你去过包头没有？”
    刘志祥抱歉地说：“我是从包头来的。”
    理发师紧接着问：“你是不是在包钢？”
    “是的，我是包钢的工人。”
    “包钢？”理发师高兴了。“你们什么时候出钢？”
    “快了，明年可以出铁出钢了。”
    “要快点呀同志，我们都望着你们呢！”
    像这样的关怀，很多人都遇到过。我曾在火车上、医院里遇到过。提前再提前，加快出铁出钢出钢材；加快为祖国出还没有的特种钢材来答谢党和人民的支持和关怀！这就是建设者们之所以忘我地创造、忘我地劳动的原因。
    全国最大的、世界少见的破碎厂的雏形，已经立起在白云山下。这座深入地下三十多公尺，六十多公尺高的钢筋混凝土结构，如果材料跟上，也早已完成了。矿山建设者称之为“长城”的盘山电车铁路出现了，从湖南来的电机车在试车时着急地叫着：“快来枕木呀！”将来，在巨型凿孔机劳动过的地方，经过爆破手粉碎的铁石堆旁，经过一次张嘴就能吞掉四吨、六吨矿石的电铲，吐在电车皮上，顺着“长城”的脊梁，泻在破碎厂，再由输送系统送到城堡似的储矿槽，再流进穿过地阔天空的乌兰察草原的火车，运到乌拉山前，化为金星飞舞的铁水黄河。
    包头钢铁基地在诞生中。但是这个钢铁巨人要诞生在一个遥远的荒野上。它需要的不是两只普通的奶瓶、几件普通的小衫。它需要各种各样的配件、仪器、发电机……为着它的诞生，只说最普通的螺丝钉，不是一吨十吨，而是要十几个大火车皮！
    我曾经有一次和人们誉为鹰群的金结二队青年突击连副连长孙健，登上安装了十九圈的高炉上。我问他什么时候能全部安装好。他说：
    “如果材料供应跟上，就快啦！”
    他像个远征的战士，在胜利的决战前夕，等待后援。他望着远方的天云，似乎说：我们感谢祖国的支援和关怀！但我们急需弹药，以便更早的以凯歌来报答祖国！
    我现在才了解：为什么这里的各级会议上，都在赞美红娘。为着成全我国的一个重要的钢铁基地，愿天下无崔母，各地有红娘！（附图片）
