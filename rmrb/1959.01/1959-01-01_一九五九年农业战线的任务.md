1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, a year of the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and also a year in which China's agricultural production achieved unprecedented bumper harvests and an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. As we bid farewell to the old year and usher in the New Year, we should look back at the great victories and rich experiences gained on the agricultural front in 1958 to greet the new tasks brought by the New Year, and strive with full confidence and continued efforts to achieve the new tasks of 1959.

I.

The total grain output in 1958 is estimated to be around 750 billion jin, an increase of about 380 billion jin compared to 370 billion jin in 1957. The total cotton output is about 67 million dan, an increase of about 34 million dan compared to 32.8 million dan in 1957. The output of both grain and cotton in 1958 doubled compared to 1957, and even slightly exceeded that. There was also a significant increase in the production of oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame. Excluding those not used for oil extraction, the production of edible vegetable oil increased by about 50% compared to 1957. The output of flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and sugar beets all increased several times over. The growth rate of agricultural products such as hemp, silk, tea, and fruits varied from 20%, 30%, to 40%, all of which were significant increases. The development of animal husbandry was also rare in previous years, with more than 5 million more large livestock than in 1957, 30 million more sheep, and about 60 million more pigs. All of this shows that China's agricultural production in 1958 was indeed an unprecedented bumper harvest and Great Leap Forward.

The increase in the output of various crops in 1958 was mainly due to the increase in yield per unit area, and the increase in sown area was not significant. For example, the average yield per mu of grain crops, calculated by sown area and including potatoes, increased from 204 jin in 1957 to more than 400 jin, and excluding potatoes, increased from 196 jin to more than 350 jin, both about double that of 1957. The yield per mu of grain calculated by cultivated area has reached or exceeded the per-mu yield targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Forty Articles) to be achieved within twelve years in three-quarters of the counties (cities, banners) across the country. The yield per mu of cotton increased from 38 jin to 75 jin, also double that of 1957. The yield per mu of most cotton fields across the country has reached or exceeded the level set in the National Agricultural Development Program to be achieved within twelve years. On the basis of the general increase in yield per unit area, many large areas of high-yield fields and small areas of "satellite fields" have also emerged. For example, according to incomplete statistics, the area of grain crops (excluding potatoes) with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu is about 160 million mu, accounting for about one-tenth of the sown area of grain crops. In 1958, the total output and yield per unit area of many crops increased several times over, and the annual growth rate greatly exceeded the total growth in the five years of the First Five-Year Plan. This fact threw the old tune that "the growth rate of agricultural production can only increase by a few percent per year and cannot be faster" to the winds. The situation of the agricultural leap forward in 1958 is also manifested in "turning low-yield into high-yield, and making high-yield even higher." Many low-yield areas, such as Yulin in northern Shaanxi and Shuoxian in northern Shanxi, have turned over. Some crops that have always been considered low-yield, such as wheat and sesame, have also launched "high-yield satellites" and shed their "low-yield hats." This has broken the old concepts that bound people's minds and liberated people's thinking. At the same time, as the Party Central Committee pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes": "In the past, people often worried that we have a large population and little cultivated land, but the fact of the great agricultural harvest in 1958 overthrew this argument. As long as we seriously promote the experience of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, layered fertilization, and rational close planting to obtain extremely large high-yield harvests, cultivated land is not small, but more, and the population is not large, but feels that there is a shortage of labor. This will be a huge change." In the face of the great harvest in 1958, kind-hearted people can get rid of this worry, and bourgeois demographers should also be taught a lesson. Imperialists and reactionaries always curse us, saying that we "cannot get rid of the contradiction of a large population that is increasing rapidly, while agricultural products increase very slowly." The fact of China's agricultural Great Leap Forward has also given them a merciless blow, and will continue to give them a merciless blow. Facts are the most eloquent. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 undeniably shows that under the leadership of the Party, the working people have been economically liberated and have achieved victory in the political and ideological socialist revolution, which will unleash the unimaginable and immeasurable subjective initiative and creativity of the people.

II.

The experience of the agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958 is very rich. I believe that it can be summarized into three points: "Politics in Command," the mass line, and the "Eight-Character Charter."

First, "Politics in Command." "Politics in Command" is essentially strengthening the leadership of the Party. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 was a great achievement in implementing the general line of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong of "Going All Out, Aiming High, and Building Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results." The lessons of "Anti-Rash Advance" in the second half of 1956 and the spring of 1957, and "Right-leaning conservatism, willing to stay downstream, less, slower, worse, and more expensive" are still fresh in our minds. Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party can we implement "Politics in Command." Without the leadership of the Party, what "Politics in Command" can we talk about? And with what "Politics" to take "command"? Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party and conducting extensive and in-depth socialist and communist ideological education among cadres and the masses can we wage a struggle against various erroneous tendencies, and can we correctly implement the Party's line and policies. This is "Politics in Command." Advocating the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and liberating the mind is also an important experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. And daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do involves the question of what to think, what to say, and what to do. We must dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do according to the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and according to objective laws, instead of thinking randomly, speaking randomly, and doing randomly away from Marxism-Leninism and away from science. Therefore, daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do must also closely rely on the leadership of the Party, and must also have "Politics in Command."

Second, the mass line. The mass line is our Party's glorious tradition. Whether on the industrial front, the agricultural front, or on all fronts of socialist construction, the traditional good style of the mass line is an important "magic weapon" for achieving the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The great blooming, great contending, and big-character posters created in the Party-wide and nationwide rectification movement and widely applied in agricultural production and various rural work; doing what, blooming what, contending what, this is a new form of socialist democracy and a new creation of the mass line. The three-way combination of cadres, masses, and technical personnel, planting experimental fields, and cadres participating in production to lead production is a new creation in implementing the mass line in leading the masses in production and fighting against nature. The leadership method of "grasping both ends and leading the middle" is also a concrete method of implementing the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." The new method of on-the-spot conferences to promote experience is to directly bring everyone to the scene of the new creations of the masses to "learn from the scriptures," summarize experience on the spot, observe and learn in the field, and promote it after returning, which is effective and fast. This is also a new method of implementing the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." All of this shows that in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the traditional style of the mass line has been well promoted and has undergone new development; and it is precisely this promotion and development that has guaranteed the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings of socialist construction in 1958.

Third, the "Eight-Character Charter." Water (water conservancy), fertilizer (fertilizer), soil (deep plowing, soil improvement), seed (improved varieties), density (close planting), protection (plant protection, prevention and control of pests and diseases), tools (tool reform), and management (field management), these eight characters are the "Eight-Character Charter" proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong based on summarizing the experience of peasants in increasing production measures. The practice in 1958 proved that where this "Charter" was conscientiously implemented, the growth rate of agricultural production was relatively large; where the implementation of this "Charter" was relatively poor, the increase was relatively small, or the proportion of increase was very small, or there was no increase, and individual counties, townships, and communes even reduced production. Of course, the specific practices of each character of the "Eight-Character Charter" should be adapted to local conditions, and different crops and different varieties should also have different practices, not uniformly. However, although the practices are different, in general, it has become a generally accepted conclusion that the "Eight-Character Charter" must be conscientiously implemented. This is a fundamental experience in technical measures for increasing production in the agricultural production Great Leap Forward in 1958.

III.

The rural areas across the country (except for individual regions), from August and September 1958, quickly and smoothly realized the people's commune in a few months. This is another great victory with far-reaching significance on the agricultural front in 1958. After the realization of the three major socialist transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, after correctly handling contradictions among the people, the Party-wide and nationwide rectification movement, the nationwide struggle against the frenzied attack of the bourgeois rightists, and the socialist education movement in the rural areas, the question of who will win between the two roads of socialism and capitalism has been relatively thoroughly resolved on the ideological and political fronts. It also resolved which line to take in the two lines of building socialism, "Go All Out, Aim High, and Build Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results" and "Right-leaning conservatism, willing to stay downstream, less, slower, worse, and more expensive." It also further resolved the problem of developing the work style of the mass line to constantly overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy, thus causing a Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and a nationwide socialist and communist ideological liberation. The People's Commune movement was produced on this basis. As the Central Committee pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes": "The emergence of the people's commune is not accidental, it is the product of China's economic and political development, the product of the Party's socialist rectification movement, the general line of socialist construction, and the socialist construction Great Leap Forward in 1958."

As soon as the People's Commune was established, it showed greater superiority than the previous agricultural production cooperatives. The organizational scale of the People's Commune is much larger than the previous agricultural production cooperative. At the beginning of 1958, there were more than 740,000 agricultural cooperatives across the country, with an average of about 170 households per cooperative, several hundred laborers (a large number of women laborers were still bound by trivial housework), and more than 2,000 mu of land. The current more than 26,500 rural people's communes have an average of nearly 5,000 households per commune, with about 10,000 laborers and about 6,000 mu of land. The large size of the commune and the large number of people mean that labor, land, and other means of production can be uniformly planned, uniformly allocated, and uniformly used on a larger scale, thus making them more reasonable and effective. The previous agricultural production cooperatives were basically engaged in agricultural production alone, while the current rural people's communes are developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in an all-round way. The manufacture of local chemical fertilizers, local pesticides, and building materials such as local cement and bricks, the manufacture and repair of local machinery and farm tools, the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural products, and the small-scale industries of coal mining, mining, iron smelting, and steelmaking have been established everywhere by rural people's communes. Rural commercial and banking institutions originally operated by the state have also been delegated to the People's Communes. Commune-run primary schools, middle schools, and red and expert schools have also developed like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The People's Commune also used the experience of the past revolutionary war period to implement the combination of labor and military, and correspondingly established militia organizations in production organizations at all levels. At the same time, the current rural people's commune is also one with the grassroots political power. Therefore, it can be said that the People's Commune is a basic-level unit of the socialist social structure that combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government and commune.

From the establishment of the People's Commune to now, it is not the slack farming season, but the busy farming season. The three autumn works of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting are very tense, because the agricultural harvest is great, and the workload of autumn harvesting has doubled compared with previous years. The task of deep plowing in the autumn of 1958 has been completed by about 700 million mu by the end of November, according to statistics. 370 million mu of wheat were planted, plus other miscellaneous grains for summer harvest and winter rapeseed, the area of autumn planting reached more than 550 million mu, and the plowing was deeper and the planting was better than in previous years. At the same time, a nationwide upsurge of steelmaking by the whole people was also set off across the country. Many People's Communes drew out 30% or even about half of their labor force as soon as they were established to mine coal, make coke, burn charcoal, mine, smelt iron, and make steel, and groups of local furnaces were established everywhere, which played a huge role in completing the task of doubling steel production in 1958. If the people's commune had not been implemented, it would have been unimaginable to draw out such a large amount of labor from the agricultural front to the industrial front in the tense autumn busy season while doubling the output of grain and cotton. The simultaneous development of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, autumn planting, and the large-scale development of steel is a powerful proof of the great superiority of the People's Commune. Therefore, it can be said that "the People's Commune will accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country." The new situation of the rural People's Commune is obviously preparing more favorable conditions for striving for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture in 1959.

At the present stage, our task is to build socialism. The current People's Commune is basically a collective ownership system. The nature of the People's Commune is still socialist, and its distribution principle is still distribution according to work. It will take a considerable period of time to transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and it will take even longer to transition from socialism to communism. However, the People's Commune "points out to the people of our country the road to gradually industrializing the countryside, the road to gradually transitioning from collective ownership in agriculture to ownership by the whole people, and the road to gradually transitioning from the socialist 'distribution according to work' (that is, paying according to labor) to the communist 'distribution according to need' (that is, each according to their needs)." Therefore, it can be said that the rural people's commune is a great victory with more far-reaching significance on the agricultural front in 1958.

IV.

The achievements on the agricultural front in 1958 were unprecedentedly great. However, agricultural production has not completely "passed the test." First, the total grain output in 1958 averaged only about 1,200 jin per person according to the national population. To achieve the requirement of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per person, it is necessary to increase production by another one to two times on the basis of the output in 1958. Potatoes accounted for about one-quarter of the total grain output in 1958, and the proportion of potatoes should be appropriately reduced in the future. Second, the total cotton output in 1958 averaged only about ten jin per person according to the national population. To achieve "ample clothing," it is also necessary to increase production by another one to two times on the basis of 1958. Third, the production of oil crops and hemp has not fundamentally passed the test, and the supply of edible vegetable oil and hemp is still tight. Fourth, the output of tea and silk, which have always been world-renowned, has not yet recovered to the highest historical level. Fifth, animal husbandry production is still a weak link in agricultural production. Animal power is still insufficient, and livestock and poultry still cannot meet the growing needs of urban and rural people for meat. These are the five tests in agricultural production. To pass these five tests, it is necessary to continue to go all out and leap forward again. Any relaxation and discouragement are harmful.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed that the total grain output in 1959 should be increased to 1,050 billion jin, an increase of about 300 billion jin compared to 1958; the total cotton output should be increased to 100 million dan, an increase of about 34 million dan compared to 1958. This requirement is entirely possible to achieve, and should be strived to achieve, and strive to exceed. In terms of grain, all provinces and regions where the average per capita for urban and rural residents is less than 2,000 jin should generally strive to reach 2,000 jin, except for individual cases where conditions are special; provinces and regions that are close to or have reached 2,000 jin should strive to exceed 2,000 jin and strive for an average of 3,000 jin per person. In 1959, efforts should be made to ensure that the production of oil crops and hemp passes the test. The annual output of oil crops, excluding those not used for oil extraction, should be no less than 6 million tons of edible vegetable oil. Tea, silk, and various industrial raw material crops are required to have greater development, and efforts should be made to reclaim old tea gardens and mulberry forests and plant new ones, so that in a relatively short period of time, the historical peak levels of tea and silk can not only be restored but also greatly exceeded. In terms of large livestock, efforts should be made to ensure that all breeding female animals of appropriate age are fully pregnant, and to carry out the "Four All Movement" of "full mating, full accurate foals, full abortion protection, and full survival." Pigs and sheep should also have greater development, not only requiring a faster rate of development, but also requiring a certain slaughter rate, meat yield, and market supply. The production of chickens, ducks, and vegetables must also be well arranged to ensure the supply of meat, vegetables, and other non-staple foods to urban and rural residents. Rural people's communes should regard the supply of non-staple foods to urban residents as an important responsibility.

In order to achieve a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, first of all, we must seize the current field management of overwintering crops such as wheat and rapeseed, do a good job in winter irrigation and topdressing, and eliminate third-class seedlings. We must also seize the early rice, and now we must do a good job in preparing for early rice sowing after the spring. Grasping wheat, rapeseed, and early rice to ensure a great harvest in the first harvest season of 1959 is the first key to striving for a great harvest throughout the year. In the agricultural "Eight-Character Charter," water, fertilizer, soil, seed, tool reform, and prevention and control of pests and diseases are all to be prepared in winter and are important contents of winter production. The old saying "A year's plan lies in spring" has long been inapplicable in agricultural production, but rather "A year's plan lies in the previous winter." Winter production and all preparations for spring plowing in 1959 must be done well.

The second key to striving for a great harvest in 1959 is to strive to carry out the movement of large-area high-yield fields. In 1959, the sown area of crops such as cotton, rapeseed, and soybeans is expected to have no increase, or not much increase, and the sown area of grain will be reduced somewhat compared to 1958. The main way to increase production is to greatly increase the yield per unit area. In 1958, there were 160 million mu of grain with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and cotton fields with a yield of over 100 jin of lint cotton per mu accounted for about two-fifths of the cotton planting area. This is the actual basis for carrying out the movement of large-area high-yield fields in 1959. In 1959, the "Eight-Character Charter" in terms of agricultural production measures must be universally, practically, and better implemented, changing the past shallow plowing and extensive cultivation, and extensive planting with low harvest to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and less planting with more harvest, to ensure the victorious realization of the movement of large-area high-yield fields, ensure the completion and overcompletion of the production increase targets of grain, cotton, oil, and other various industrial raw material crops, and strive for a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production.

At the same time, the success of the movement of large-area high-yield fields in 1959 will lay a preliminary foundation for the realization of the "three-thirds system" of land utilization and the great land landscaping. We will be more confident and full of confidence to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's great ideal of land landscaping in a considerable period of time.

V.

Agricultural production is not just the planting of crops, it must be the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are even more mutually combined and interdependent. The Central Committee pointed out that with the solution of the grain problem, the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, hemp, silk, soybeans, oil, sugar, tea, tobacco, and medicinal materials in all agricultural production should be gradually increased, and great attention should be paid to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery; and pointed out that a full-line great revolution must be carried out in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery to completely change the face of the entire agricultural front.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee, the policy of developing production in rural people's communes should be: "According to the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, and according to the principle of diligence and frugality in running communes, implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the simultaneous development of self-sufficiency production and commodity production." Rural people's communes should gradually transfer an appropriate number of laborers from the agricultural front to the industrial front with the success of the movement of large-area high-yield fields, the implementation of the policy of "less planting with high yield and more harvest," and the gradual realization of the "three-thirds system" of land utilization, and greatly develop industry. The situation where six-fifths of the country's population is engaged in agricultural production must be changed; otherwise, our country will not have a highly developed modernized industry, will not be able to truly realize socialist industrialization, and will not be able to fundamentally change the face of our country. The People's Commune's large-scale development of industry and gradual realization of commune industrialization will not only accelerate the process of industrialization in our country, but also promote the realization of ownership by the whole people in rural areas and narrow the gap between cities and villages.

Of course, the industrialization of the commune and the full-line great revolution of the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and the complete change in the face of the entire agricultural front, cannot be completed in one year in 1959. However, a big step must be taken in this direction in 1959. Therefore, when formulating plans for 1959, each place and each People's Commune, in addition to specifying the production increase targets for grain, also needs to set the production increase targets for cotton, hemp, oil, and other various industrial raw material crops, the development targets for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and the targets for commune-run industries according to the principle of adapting to local conditions. There is also a certain proportional relationship between grain and various industrial raw material crops, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline production, and commune-run industries. In the past, many agricultural production cooperatives were mainly engaged in grain production, and grain accounted for a large proportion of the total output value. In the future, while continuing to increase grain production, the proportion of grain in the total output value of the People's Commune must be gradually reduced.

Only by growing a variety of industrial raw material crops, expanding diversified operations, and developing commune-run industries can the commodity production of the People's Commune be greatly increased and the simultaneous development of self-sufficiency production and commodity production can be truly realized. Developing socialist commodity production can promote the entire socialist economy to develop forward at a faster rate. As far as rural people's communes are concerned, only with the great development of commodity production can the People's Commune "exchange for the necessary machinery and equipment, realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, and also exchange for the consumer goods and cash needed to supply the members and pay wages, and gradually increase wages." Now, some People's Communes that mainly produce grain have surplus grain, especially potatoes, and it is too late to process and sell them temporarily. The cash turnover of the commune is not working, and production investment and wage expenditures are also in difficulty. This is a very obvious example. Therefore, it can be said that developing commodity production is a major measure to consolidate and develop the People's Commune.

In 1959, while continuing to increase grain production, significant achievements must be made in greatly developing various industrial raw material crops, in accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline production, and in simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and in simultaneously developing self-sufficiency production and commodity production. We must do everything possible to strive for a great harvest of agricultural crops in 1959 and achieve a comprehensive leap forward in the five industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and commune-run industries.

VI.

Finally, in order to achieve the new tasks of 1959, it is necessary to continue to go all out and aim high. Any thoughts and practices of relaxation and discouragement are harmful and must be resolutely opposed. At the same time, soaring enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis. Comrade Mao Zedong told us that we must be both hot and cold in our work, which are two opposites of unity. Soaring enthusiasm is hot, and scientific analysis is cold. The two must be unified. It is not right to love cold and not love heat. Without a calm mind, unwilling to do analysis, and only loving heat is also not right. This is also another aspect of the experience gained in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. We must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a pragmatic spirit and advocate a realistic style. When formulating production plan targets, we should fully consider the basis for achieving the targets. The targets should be based on objective actual possibilities, that is, based on realistic possibilities, and not based on empty fantasies without objective possibilities. In the entire process of implementing the production plan, we should also be realistic and resolutely guard against exaggeration and falsification. Economic work must be done more and more meticulously and more and more solidly.

1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and it is the first production year after the realization of the People's Commune. The tasks on the agricultural front in 1959 are very arduous and must be completed. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the rich experience gained, and under the favorable new situation where the People's Commune has been realized in the rural areas across the country, the huge tasks on the agricultural front in 1959 are also entirely possible to complete. It is necessary to seriously study the Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" in the current movement to rectify and consolidate the People's Commune, combined with the current winter production and preparation for farming, to improve awareness ideologically and unify understanding of the People's Commune; to establish and improve the system of the commune organizationally, do a good job in production, do a good job in life, develop the work style of the mass line and the realistic style, strengthen the leadership of the Party, so as to achieve a greater harvest and a comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front in 1959.

Our slogan is: Bumper harvest again bumper harvest, leap forward again leap forward!

    一九五九年农业战线的任务
    廖鲁言
    1958年是我国社会主义建设大跃进的一年，是我们党的社会主义建设总路线伟大胜利的一年，也是我国的农业生产获得空前未有的大丰收和史无前例的大跃进的一年。在除旧岁、迎新年的时候，我们应当回顾一下一九五八年在农业战线上所取得的伟大胜利和丰富经验，来迎接新的一年所带来的新任务，并且信心百倍地、再接再厉地为实现一九五九年的新任务而奋斗。
    一
    一九五八年的粮食总产量，预计为七千五百亿斤左右，比一九五七年的三千七百亿斤增加三千八百亿斤左右。棉花总产量六千七百万担左右，比一九五七年的三千二百八十万担增加三千四百万担左右。一九五八年粮食和棉花的产量都比一九五七年增加了一倍，还略有超过。大豆、花生、油菜籽和芝麻等油料作物也有很大的增产，除去不用于榨油的以外，可生产的食用植物油，比一九五七年增长50％左右。烤烟、甘蔗和甜菜的产量都是成倍地增长。麻类、蚕丝、茶叶和水果等农产品的增长比例，为20％、30％、40％不等，也都是显著地增产。畜牧业的发展也是历年少有的，大家畜比一九五七年增加五百多万头，羊增加三千万只，猪增加六千万头左右。这一切都说明，一九五八年我国的农业生产，的确是空前的大丰收和大跃进。
    一九五八年各种农作物产量的增长，主要是由于单位面积产量的提高，播种面积增加得并不多。例如，粮食作物的亩产量，按播种面积计算，包括薯类在内，平均由一九五七年的二百零四斤提高到四百斤以上，薯类除外，平均由一百九十六斤提高到三百五十斤以上，都比一九五七年提高一倍左右；按耕地面积计算的粮食亩产量，全国已有四分之三的县（市、旗）达到或者超过了全国农业发展纲要（四十条）规定在十二年内达到的亩产指标。棉花的亩产量，由三十八斤提高到七十五斤，也比一九五七年提高一倍。全国绝大多数棉田的亩产量已经达到或者超过了全国农业发展纲要规定在十二年内达到的水平。在单位面积产量普遍提高的基础上，还涌现出许多大面积的高产田和小面积的卫星田。例如，粮食作物
  （不包括薯类）亩产千斤以上的，据不完全的统计，有一亿六千万亩左右，约占粮食作物播种面积的十分之一。一九五八年许多农作物的总产量和单位面积产量成倍地增长，一年的增长速度大大超过了第一个五年计划期间五年增长的总和。这一事实，把所谓“农业增产速度一年只能增加百分之几，不能更快”的陈腐论调抛到九霄云外去了。一九五八年农业跃进的形势，还表现为
  “低产变高产，高产更高产”。许多低产地区，例如陕北的榆林和雁北的朔县等等，都已经翻了身。一些历来被认为是低产的作物，例如麦子、芝麻等，也放出了“高产卫星”，摘掉了“低产帽子”。这就打破了束缚人们思想的旧观念，解放了人们的思想。同时，正如党中央在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中所指出的：“过去人们经常忧愁我们的人口多，耕地少，但是一九五八年农业大丰产的事实，把这种论断推翻了。只要认真推广深耕细作、分层施肥、合理密植而获得极其大量的高额丰产的经验，耕地就不是少了，而是多了，人口就不是多了，而是感到劳动力不足了。这将是一个极大的变化。”在一九五八年大丰收的事实面前，好心肠的人可以摆脱这种忧愁了，资产阶级的人口论者也应该得到了教训。帝国主义和反动派总是诅咒我们，说我们“无法摆脱人口多、增加得快，而农产品增加很慢的矛
  盾”。我国农业大跃进的事实也给了他们以无情的打击，并且将继续给他们以无情的打击。事实是最雄辩的。一九五八年的大跃进无可争辩地说明了，在党的领导下，劳动人民在经济上获得了解放，又取得了政治上和思想上的社会主义革命的胜利，就会发挥出人们想像不到的、不可估量的主观能动性和创造性。

    一九五八年农业大跃进的经验是非常丰富的，我以为，可以集中起来，归纳为三条：“政治挂帅”、群众路线和“八字宪法”。
    第一，“政治挂帅”。“政治挂帅”，实质就是加强党的领导。一九五八年的大跃进，就是贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志的“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的伟大成果。一九五六年下半年和一九五七年春天的
  “反冒进”，“右倾保守、甘居下游、少慢差费”所带来的教训在我们的头脑中还是记忆犹新的。只有加强党的领导，才能实行“政治挂帅”。离开了党的领导，还谈得上什么“政治挂帅”？又是用什么“政治”去“挂帅”呢？只有加强党的领导，在干部和群众中广泛深入地进行社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，才能同各种错误的倾向展开斗争，也才能正确执行党的路线和政策。这就是“政治挂帅”。提倡敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，解放思想，这也是一九五八年大跃进的一条重要经验。而敢想、敢说、敢做，就有一个想什么、说什么、做什么的问题。我们要根据马列主义的普遍真理、根据客观规律去敢想、敢说、敢做，而不是离开马列主义、离开科学去乱想、乱说、乱做。所以，敢想敢说敢做也必须紧密依靠党的领导，也要“政治挂帅”。
    第二，群众路线。群众路线是我们党的光荣传统。无论在工业战线上、农业战线上和社会主义建设事业的各个战线上，群众路线这个传统的优良作风，是取得一九五八年大跃进的重要“法宝”。在全党全民整风运动中创造出来的，在农业生产和农村各项工作中普遍应用的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报；做什么，鸣放什么，辩论什么，这是社会主义民主的一种新形式，也是群众路线的一种新创造。干部、群众和技术人员三结合，种试验田，干部参加生产领导生产，这是在领导群众生产、向自然界作斗争方面，贯彻群众路线的一种新创造。“抓两头、带中间”的领导方法，也就是实行从群众中来、到群众中去的一种具体方法。现场会议这种推广经验的新方式，则是把大家直接带到群众新创造的现场去“取经”，就地总结经验，实地观摩学习，回去推广，收效大而且快，这也是实行从群众中来、到群众中去的一种新方法。这一切说明，在一九五八年大跃进中，群众路线的传统作风有了很好的发扬和新的发展；也正是这种发扬和发展，保证了一九五八年工农业生产和社会主义建设各项事业的大跃进。
    第三，“八字宪法”。水（水利）、肥（肥料）、土（深翻地、改良土壤）、种（良种）、密（密植）、保（植物保护、防治病虫害）、工（工具改革）、管（田间管理），这八个字，是毛泽东同志总结了农民群众增产措施的经验而提出的“八字宪法”。一九五八年的实践证明，那里认真贯彻执行了这个“宪法”，那里的农业生产的增长幅度就比较大；那里贯彻执行这个“宪法”比较差，那里的增产幅度就比较小，或者增产的比例很小，或者没有增产，个别的县、乡和公社甚至减产。当然，“八字宪法”的每一个字的具体做法，应该因地制宜，不同的作物和不同的品种也应该有不同的做法，不是千篇一律的。但是，做法尽管不同，总的来说，必须认真执行这个“八字宪法”，则已经成为公认的结论。这是一九五八年农业生产大跃进在增产技术措施方面的一条根本经验。
    三
    全国农村（除个别地区以外），从一九五八年八、九月起，经过几个月的时间，迅速地顺利地实现了人民公社化。这是一九五八年农业战线上又一个伟大的、具有深远意义的胜利。在实现了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义三大改造以后，经过正确处理人民内部矛盾、全党全民的整风运动、全民性的反对资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的大斗争、农村中的社会主义教育运动，在思想战线和政治战线上比较彻底地解决了社会主义和资本主义这两条道路谁战胜谁的问题，也解决了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省”和
  “右倾保守、甘居下游、少慢差费”这两条建设社会主义的路线中究竟采取那条路线的问题，还进一步解决了发扬群众路线的工作作风来不断地克服主观主义、官僚主义作风的问题，因而引起了社会主义建设大跃进和全民性的社会主义、共产主义思想大解放。人民公社运动就是在这样的基础上产生的。正如中央在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中所指出的：“人民公社的出现不是偶然的，它是我国经济和政治发展的产物，是党的社会主义整风运动、社会主义建设总路线和一九五八年社会主义建设大跃进的产物。”
    人民公社一成立，就表现了比以前的农业生产合作社更大的优越性。人民公社的组织规模比以前的农业生产合作社大得多。在一九五八年初，全国有七十四万多个农业合作社，每社平均约一百七十户，三百几十个劳动力（其中大批的妇女劳动力还束缚在繁琐的家务劳动中），二千多亩地。现在的两万六千五百多个农村人民公社，每社平均将近五千户，有一万个左右劳动力和六千亩左右的土地。社大人多力量大，劳动力、土地和其他生产资料可以在更大的范围内统一规划、统一调配、统一使用，因而使用得更合理、更有效。以前的农业生产合作社基本上是单纯从事农业生产的，现在的农村人民公社则是工业和农业并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的。土化肥、土农药以及土水泥和砖瓦等建筑材料的制造，土机械和农具的制造和修理，农产品的加工和综合利用，以及挖煤、采矿、炼铁、炼钢等等小型工业，已经由农村人民公社到处兴办起来。原来由国家经营的农村商业和银行等机构，也下放给人民公社。社办小学、中学和红专学校也如雨后春笋般地发展起来。人民公社还运用了过去革命战争时期的经验，实行劳武结合，在各级生产组织中，相应地建立民兵组织。同时，现在的农村人民公社又是同基层政权合而为一的。所以说，人民公社是工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的社会主义社会结构的基层单位。
    从人民公社成立到现在，并不是农闲季节，而是农忙季节。秋收、秋耕和秋种的三秋工作十分紧张，因为农业大丰收，秋收的工作量比往年成倍地增长了。一九五八年秋季深翻土地的任务，到十一月底的统计，已经完成了约七亿亩。种麦三亿七千万亩，加上其他夏收的杂粮和冬油菜，秋种的面积达五亿五千万亩以上，并且耕得比往年深，种得比往年好。与此同时，全国各地还掀起了一个全民炼钢铁的高潮，许多人民公社一成立就抽调出30％甚至一半左右的劳动力，去挖煤、炼焦、烧木炭、采矿、炼铁、炼钢，到处建立起来了土炉群，这对于完成一九五八年钢产量翻一番的任务起了巨大的作用。如果不实行人民公社化，要在粮食、棉花产量翻一番的同时，在紧张的秋忙季节，从农业战线抽出这样大量的劳动力到工业战线上来，那是不可想像的。秋收、秋耕、秋种和大办钢铁同时并举，就是人民公社巨大优越性的有力的证明。所以说，“人民公社将加快我国社会主义建设的速度”。农村人民公社化的新形势，显然是为争取一九五九年农业更大的丰收和全面的跃进准备了更为有利的条件。
    在现阶段，我们的任务是建设社会主义，目前的人民公社基本上还是集体所有制的，人民公社的性质还是社会主义的，它的分配原则还是按劳分配。由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制还需要经过一段相当的时间，由社会主义过渡到共产主义，时间需要的更长。但是，人民公社却“为我国人民指出了农村逐步工业化的道路，农业中的集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的道路。社会主义的‘按劳分配’（即按劳付酬）逐步过渡到共产主义的‘按需分配’（即各取所需）的道路”。所以说，农村人民公社化是一九五八年农业战线上的一个具有更为深远的意义的伟大胜利。
    四
    一九五八年农业战线上的成就是空前伟大的。但是农业生产并没有完全“过关”。第一，一九五八年的粮食总产量按全国人口平均，每人不过一千二百斤左右，要实现每人两千到三千斤的要求，还要在一九五八年产量的基础上再增产一倍到两倍。薯类在一九五八年的粮食总产量中约占四分之一，今后应该适当地压低薯类的比重。第二，一九五八年的棉花总产量，按全国人口平均，每人不过十斤，要实现“丰衣”，也还要在一九五八年的基础上再增产一倍到两倍。第三，油料作物和麻类的生产还根本没有过关，食用植物油和麻的供应，目前还是紧张的。第四，历来闻名于世界的茶叶和蚕丝，产量还没有恢复到历史上的最高水平。第五，畜牧业生产还是农业生产中的一个薄弱环节，畜力仍感不足，家畜家禽仍不能满足城乡人民日益增长的肉食的需要。这是农业生产上的五关。要过这五关，还必须继续鼓足干劲，跃进再跃进。任何松劲和泄气的情绪，都是有害的。
    党的八届六中全会提出，一九五九年的粮食总产量要增加到一万零五百亿斤，比一九五八年增加三千亿斤左右；棉花总产量要增加到一亿担，比一九五八年增加三千四百万担左右。这个要求是完全可能实现的，应该力求实现，并且争取超过。在粮食方面，凡是按城乡人口平均还不到两千斤的省区，除个别条件特殊的以外，一般应该争取达到两千斤；已经接近或者达到两千斤的省区，应该争取超过两千斤，并且向每人平均三千斤而努力。一九五九年应该力争油料作物和麻类的生产过关。油料作物的全年产量，除去不用于榨油的以外，要求做到生产食用植物油不少于六百万吨。茶叶、蚕丝和各种工业原料作物，都要求有更大的发展，并且努力垦复旧有的和培植新的茶园和桑林、柞树林，以便在较短的时期内，不仅恢复到而且大大超过茶叶和蚕丝的历史最高水平。在大家畜方面，要力争适龄母畜的满怀，开展“全配种、全准驹、全保胎、全成活”的“四全运动”。猪、羊也要有较大的发展，不仅要求有较快的发展速度，还要求保证一定的屠宰率、出肉量和上市量。鸡鸭蔬菜的生产，也必须有很好的安排，保证城乡人民肉食、蔬菜等副食品的供应。农村人民公社应该把供应城市人民的副食品当做自己的一项重要责任。
    为了实现一九五九年更大的丰收和农业生产的全面跃进，首先要抓紧当前的小麦和油菜等越冬作物的田间管理，做好冬灌和追肥，消灭三类苗。还要抓早稻，现在就要做好开春后早稻播种的准备工作。抓紧小麦、油菜和早稻，保证一九五九年第一个收获季节的大丰收，这是争取全年大丰收的第一个关键。农业“八字宪法”中，水、肥、土、种、工具改革和防治病虫害等，都是要在冬季做好准备工作的，都是农村冬季生产的重要内容。“一年之计在于春”的老话，在农业生产上早已不适用了，而是“一年之计在于前冬”，冬季生产和为一九五九年春耕的一切准备工作，都必须切实做好。
    争取一九五九年大丰收的第二个关键是，努力开展大面积高额丰产田运动。一九五九年的棉花、油菜、大豆等作物的播种面积，预计并没有什么增加，或者增加不多，粮食的播种面积还将比一九五八年减少些，增产的主要途径是大大提高单位面积产量。一九五八年，粮食千斤亩有一亿六千万亩，亩产百斤皮棉以上的棉田约占植棉面积的五分之二左右，这就是一九五九年开展大面积高额丰产田运动的实际根据。一九五九年必须普遍地、切实地、更好地贯彻执行农业生产措施方面的“八字宪法”，改变过去的浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收，保证大面积高额丰产田运动的胜利实现，保证粮、棉、油和其他各种工业原料作物的增产指标的完成和超额完成，争取农业生产更大的丰收和全面的跃进。
    同时，一九五九年大面积高额丰产田运动的成功，也就为实现耕地利用的“三三制”和大地园林化奠定初步的基础，我们将更有把握地、信心百倍地在相当的时期内实现毛泽东同志关于大地园林化的伟大理想。
    五
    农业生产不只是农作物的种植，必须是农林牧副渔的全面发展。农业、林业和牧业更是相互结合、相互依存的。中央指出，随着粮食问题的解决，应当逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中所占的比重，并且极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展；并且指出，一定要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。
    根据中央的指示，农村人民公社发展生产的方针应当是：“根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。”农村人民公社应当随着大面积高额丰产田运动的成功，“少种高产多收”的方针的实行和耕地利用的“三三制”的逐步实现，而逐步地把适当数量的劳动力从农业战线转移到工业战线上来，大办工业。全国六分之五的人口从事农业生产的局面，必须改变，否则，我们的国家就没有高度发展的现代化的工业，就不能真正实现社会主义的工业化，也就不能根本改变我们国家的面貌。人民公社大办工业，逐步实现公社工业化，不仅将加速我国工业化的过程，而且将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。
    当然，公社工业化和农林牧副渔五业的全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线上的面貌，并不是在一九五九年一年内就可以完成的。但是，一九五九年必须在这一方面前进一大步。因此，各个地方和各个人民公社，在制定一九五九年计划的时候，除了规定粮食的增产指标以外，还需要根据因地制宜的原则，定出棉、麻、油和其他各种工业原料作物的增产指标、林牧副渔业生产的发展指标和社办工业的指标。粮食和各种工业原料作物、农业和林牧渔副业和社办工业相互之间也有一个一定的比例关系。以前有许多农业生产合作社，主要从事粮食生产，粮食在总产值中占的比重很大，今后必须在继续增产粮食的同时，把粮食在人民公社总产值中所占的比重逐步压低。
    只有多种工业原料作物，扩大多种经营，发展社办工业，才能大大增加人民公社的商品生产，真正实现自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。发展社会主义的商品生产，就能够促进整个社会主义经济以较快的速度向前发展。就农村人民公社而言，也只有商品生产的大发展，人民公社“才能够换回必要的机器和设备，实现农业机械化、电气化，也才能够换回所需要的消费物资和现金，以便供应社员和发放工资，并使工资逐步增长。”现在，有一些主要生产粮食的人民公社，多余的粮食，特别是薯类，加工出售一时来不及，公社的现金周转不灵，生产投资和工资开支也发生困难。这就是很明显的例证。所以说，发展商品生产是巩固和发展人民公社的一项重大措施。
    一九五九年，在继续增产粮食的同时，必须在大大发展各种工业原料作物方面，在加速发展林业、牧业、渔业和副业生产方面，在工业和农业同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举方面，取得显著的成就。我们要千方百计地努力争取一九五九年农作物的大丰收，实现农林牧副渔五业和社办工业的全面大跃进。
    六
    最后，为了实现一九五九年的新任务，必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，任何松劲泄气的想法和做法都是有害的，都必须坚决地加以反对。同时，冲天干劲又必须和科学分析结合起来。毛泽东同志告诉我们在工作中要热又要冷，这是统一性的两个对立面。冲天干劲是热，科学分析是冷。两者必须统一起来。爱冷不爱热，是不行的。没有冷静的头脑，不愿意做分析，只爱热，也是不行的。这也是在一九五八年大跃进中取得的另一面的经验。我们必须把革命的热情和务实的精神结合起来，提倡实事求是的作风。在制定生产计划指标的时候，应该充分考虑到实现指标的根据，指标要建立在客观实际可能性的基础之上，就是说，要建立在现实的可能性的基础之上，而不要建立在没有客观可能性的空想的基础之上。在执行生产计划的全部过程中，也都应该实事求是，力戒浮夸和弄虚做假。经济工作必须是越做越细致、越踏实。
    一九五九年是苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，是实现人民公社化以后的第一个生产年。一九五九年农业战线的任务是十分艰巨的，也是必须完成的。在一九五八年大跃进和取得的丰富经验的基础上，在全国农村已经实现了人民公社化这个有利的新形势下，一九五九年农业战线上的巨大任务也是完全有可能完成的。必须在当前的整顿和巩固人民公社的运动中，结合当前的冬季生产和备耕工作，认真地学习中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，在思想上提高觉悟，统一对人民公社的认识；在组织上建立和健全公社的制度，搞好生产，搞好生活，发扬群众路线的作风和实事求是的作风，加强党的领导，从而在一九五九年在农业战线上取得更大的丰收和全面的跃进。
    我们的口号是：丰收再丰收，跃进再跃进！
