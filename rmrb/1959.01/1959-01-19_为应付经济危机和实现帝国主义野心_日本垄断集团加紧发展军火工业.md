Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th - To cope with the economic crisis and realize its imperialist ambitions, Japanese monopoly groups are stepping up the development of the armaments industry.

    Japan's Defense Agency will double its spending on missiles, rockets, and submarines in the 1959 fiscal year, starting April 1.
    The Japanese Defense Agency announced on the 17th that it would allocate over $1.1 million from its 1959 fiscal year military budget of 136 billion yen ($377.9 million) to these areas. A Defense Agency spokesman said that Japan would focus on researching and developing air-to-air missiles, anti-tank rockets, homing torpedoes, and submarine long-range exploration equipment.
    Japan's "Air Self-Defense Force" has decided to purchase 90 "Sidewinder" missiles from the United States in the 1959 fiscal year, and it is expected that 14 of them will be shipped to Japan in March. In addition, Japan has already purchased a batch of missiles from Switzerland.
    Japan's first post-war submarine will be launched in April.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th - The Japanese Defense Agency recently drafted a plan to adjust the command system of Japan's army, navy, and air force to ensure that the three services can take rapid and effective action in "emergency situations."
    The plan stipulates the establishment of a direct command system from the Prime Minister - Defense Agency Director-General - Chairman of the Joint Staff Council, and decides to strengthen the Joint Staff Council (an organization equivalent to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff) so that the Defense Agency Director-General can command the three services through this organization, instead of commanding them separately through the chiefs of staff of the army, air force, and navy as is currently the case.
    The plan also stipulates that the Joint Staff Council should first formulate a comprehensive military plan, and then formulate specific content with the assistance of the three service staff departments. The current practice is for the three service staff departments to propose plans first, and the task of the Joint Staff Council is only to adjust them. The purpose of this is to adapt to the needs of modern warfare.
    The Defense Agency's plan will be submitted to the Legislative Bureau of the Diet, the Administrative Management Agency, and the Liberal Democratic Party for discussion in early next week, and then submitted to the ordinary session of the Diet to be convened at the end of the month for approval.

    为应付经济危机和实现帝国主义野心
    日本垄断集团加紧发展军火工业
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本防卫厅将在从4月1日开始的1959财政年度中把用在导弹、火箭和潜水艇方面的费用增加一倍。
    日本防卫厅17日表示将从1959年度的一千三百六十亿日元（合三亿七千七百九十万美元）的军事预算中拨出一百一十多万美元用在这些方面。防卫厅的一个发言人说，日本将着重研究和发展空空导弹、反坦克火箭、定向鱼雷和潜水艇远距离探索器设备。
    日本“航空自卫队”决定在1959年度内向美国购买
  “响尾蛇式”导弹九十枚，预料其中的十四枚将在3月份运到日本。此外，日本已经从瑞士买了一批导弹。
    日本战后第一艘潜水艇将在4月下水。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本防卫厅最近草拟了一项调整日本陆、海、空军指挥系统的计划，以便保证日本三军在“紧急状况”时能够采取迅速而有效的行动。
    计划规定建立一个从首相—防卫厅长官—幕僚长联席会议主席的直接指挥系统，并且决定加强幕僚长联席会议（相当于美国参谋长联席会议的机构），以便使防卫厅长官通过这个机构指挥三军，而不是像现在那样分别通过陆上、航空和海上幕僚长来指挥。
    计划还规定先由幕僚长联席会议拟订一个全面的军事计划，然后分别在三军幕僚监部帮助下拟订具体内容。目前的做法是先由三军幕僚监部提出计划，幕僚长联席会议的任务仅仅是加以调整。这样做的目的是为了适应现代化战争的需要。
    防卫厅的计划将在下星期初提交国会法制局、行政管理厅和自由民主党讨论以后，提交月底将要召开的国会平时会议通过。
