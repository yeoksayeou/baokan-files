Living Diligently and Frugally

——An Account of Several Elderly Women Running a Canteen Thriftily
By our reporter Sun Shikai

In the Bai Zhi Fang North Lane resident canteen in Beijing, there are several elderly women working as cooks, continuing to promote the virtues of diligence and thrift in running collective welfare undertakings. Each of them is clever, thrifty, and makes sure that every grain of rice and every cabbage head is both saved and delicious.

When I visited the canteen recently, I saw several elderly women busy preparing lunch. Auntie Bai, who is in charge of the canteen management, told me with great enthusiasm, "The food we make has never wasted a single grain of rice or a single cabbage head. Leftover rice is mixed with cornmeal to make rice rolls and rice cakes, rice water is used to cook cabbage, and even the cabbage heads are not discarded. They are pickled with salt and drizzled with chili oil, making a delicious side dish!" She walked to the cupboard and took out a plate of "tuan fen" (starch), smiling, "This is made from the sediment of water used to wash shredded potatoes. It's great for stir-frying!" I looked closely and pinched a small piece, finding it difficult to distinguish from the starch sold in stores.

After a while, the room was filled with people eating, and the kindergarten children also arrived. Auntie Yang was busy serving food. Seeing that some of the younger children were dropping rice grains, she went to help feed them, saying kindly to the children, "Whoever eats cleanly and doesn't waste food is a good child..."

Speaking of running the canteen thriftily, Auntie Bai always says: If the cooks have the mindset of "running the house," they will find ways to plug all loopholes that cause waste. Since this resident canteen opened seven months ago, the elderly women have treated the canteen as their home, regarding grain as a treasure. They cook rice according to the number of people every day, achieving monthly planned grain consumption, and paying attention to not letting go of every small loophole that may cause waste. They found that it was easy to spill some rice and flour when washing rice and kneading dough. Even though it was just a few specks, they immediately took measures to prevent waste: make sure the rice sinks before pouring water when washing rice, and find a piece of paper to catch the spilled flour when kneading dough. Auntie Li, who is responsible for making side dishes, is even more of a thrift expert. Every vegetable in her hands can be eaten. Cabbage heads and celery leaves are all used to make side dishes, which are delicious and cheap. Here, every aspect of eating rice and burning firewood is done with strict economy. One early morning, Auntie Bai came to the canteen and saw that the coal ash in the earthen basket was a bit black. She stepped on it and found that a lot of it had not been burned thoroughly. She wrapped it in a headscarf and carried it back to the canteen, and discussed with Auntie Yang, who was responsible for emptying the stove, a way to save coal.

These elderly women not only pay attention to saving in the kitchen, but also pay attention to eliminating waste at the table. In this canteen, every day a group of children come from the kindergarten to eat. Their parents are not around, and they are always noisy, making it easy to spill food or leave leftovers. After the elderly women discovered this problem, they immediately took measures. Every time meals are served, Auntie Yang is specially assigned to take care of the children, which ensures both saving and that the children eat hot food. Seeing this scene, the people eating often praise them, saying, "These elderly women are really good at managing a household. We can rest assured when we hand over our food stamps and money to them!"

After this canteen promoted the virtues of diligence and thrift, it achieved "increasing income and reducing expenditure," both saving grain and reducing expenses. Since the start of business, it has saved more than two hundred catties of grain for the residents. Li Guifang's family of seven eats in the canteen, saving more than ten yuan a month compared to cooking at home.

These elderly women not only pay attention to saving everywhere, but also pay attention to constantly changing the variety of dishes so that everyone finds them delicious and satisfactory. Since Auntie Bai proposed making coarse grains skillfully, cornmeal can be made into more than twenty varieties, including pancakes, stuffed dumplings, and silk cakes. In winter, cabbage and bean sprouts are common vegetables, and they also make them in different ways. These are not all the cooks do. Sometimes, people working the night shift feel hungry after returning home and knock on the door to buy a piece of silk cake, and the cook on duty in the canteen also sells it to them. At the same time, for elderly people with stomach problems who come to the canteen, the cooks proactively make the rice hot and soft, so that the elderly can eat comfortably. In this way, more and more people join in eating at the canteen.

This canteen, where nearly two hundred people eat, was established after housewives participated in production. Auntie Bai and three other elderly women, encouraged by the street party organization, were determined to be good cooks. They are all family members of workers, and they personally converted five rooms into a canteen without spending a penny of public money, and the canteen opened. These elderly women have also established some good systems according to the spirit of running the canteen thriftily, including a technology research association, a life discussion meeting, and inviting people who eat to form a food committee. Every night, after they clean up the furniture, they hold a meeting to study the advantages and disadvantages of the day's dishes and the opinions of the residents, so as to save grain and run everyone's meals well.

    勤勤俭俭过日子
    ——记几位老大妈勤俭办食堂
    本报记者　孙世恺
    在北京市白纸坊北里居民食堂里，有几位担任炊事员工作的老大妈，在办集体福利事业中继续发扬着勤俭持家的美德。她们个个心灵手巧，精打细算，一粥一饭都做到既节省，又好吃。
    记者最近到这个食堂访问的时候，看到几位老大妈正在忙着做中饭。担任食堂管理工作的白大妈兴致勃勃地向我说：“我们做的饭菜没浪费过一粒米一个白菜头。剩饭再渗些棒子面做成饭卷、饭饼，米汤熬了白菜，白菜头也舍不得丢，用盐腌上浇些辣子油也是一种好吃的小菜啊！”她走到柜厨前，取出一盘“团粉”，笑着说：“这是用洗土豆丝的水沉淀成的，炒菜时可好用啦！”我仔细看了看，又用手捻了一小块，觉得很难看出和商店里卖的团粉有啥区别。
    过一会儿，吃饭的人挤满了屋子，幼儿园的孩子也来了，杨大妈忙着送饭送菜。看到较小的孩子吃饭掉些饭粒，就去帮助喂，她对孩子们亲切地说：“谁吃饭干净不浪费，谁就是好孩子……”
    谈起勤俭办食堂，白大妈总这样说：炊事员有了“当家人”的思想，就会想法堵住一切产生浪费的漏洞。这个居民食堂开办七个来月，几位老大妈都以食堂为家，把粮食看成宝中之宝。她们每天做饭都按人下米，作到月月实行计划用粮，并注意不放过每一个可能造成浪费的细小漏洞。她们发现在淘米、和面时容易撒些米面，尽管是星星点点的，也立即作出防止浪费的措施：淘米时一定使米沉沉再倒水，和面时也要找张纸接着撒出的面粉。负责做副食的李大妈更是个节约的能手，菜到她的手里全能吃，白菜头、芹菜叶都想法作成小菜，既好吃，折价又便宜。在这里，吃米、烧柴样样都厉行节约。有一天清早，白大妈从家里来到食堂门前，看见土筐里的煤灰有些发黑的，她用脚一踩，发现有好多没烧透，便用头巾抱回到食堂里，并同负责掏炉坑的杨大妈研究出节约烧煤的办法。
    这些老大妈并没有只管锅台前的节约，也注意消除饭桌上的浪费现象。在这个食堂里，每天都有一群孩子从幼儿园来吃饭，爸爸妈妈不在跟前，他们总是吵吵闹闹，最容易撒饭或剩饭。大妈们发现这个问题后，立刻采取了措施。每次开饭，都抽出杨大妈专门照顾孩子吃饭，这样既作到节约，又保证孩子吃到热饭热菜。吃饭的人们看到这种情景，端起饭碗经常这样夸奖说：“这几位老大妈真是过日子的好手，我们把粮票、饭钱交给她们可放心啦！”
    这个食堂发扬勤俭持家的美德后，做到了“开源节流”，既节约粮食，又减少开支。从开始营业以来，已为居民节约二百多斤粮食。李贵芳一家七口人在食堂吃饭，每月都比在家里自己做饭节省十多元钱。
    这几位老大妈不仅处处注意节约，还注意不断改变饭菜的花样，使大家吃起来觉得可口满意。自从白大妈提出粗粮巧作后，棒子面能做出二十多样，有烙饼、馅团子，也有丝糕。冬天，白菜、豆芽是个普通菜，她们也变着花样做。这些还不是炊事员的全部工作。有时，夜班生产的人们回家后觉得饿了，敲门要买块丝糕，食堂值班的炊事员也卖给他们。同时，有肠胃病的老人到了食堂里，炊事员们主动把饭做得又热又烂，让老人吃得舒服。这样，入伙的人便一天天多起来了。
    这个有近二百人吃饭的食堂，是在家庭妇女们参加生产后成立起来的。白大妈和另外三位老太太在街道党组织的鼓励下，决心当好炊事员。她们都是工人的家属，亲自动手把五间住房改成了食堂，没用公家一个钱，食堂就开张了。这几位老大妈还根据勤俭办食堂的精神，建立起一些好的制度，有技术研究会、生活讨论会，还邀请吃饭的人组成伙食委员会。每天晚上，她们收拾完家具，就开碰头会，研究当天饭菜的优缺点和居民的意见，作到节省用粮，又办好大家的伙食。
