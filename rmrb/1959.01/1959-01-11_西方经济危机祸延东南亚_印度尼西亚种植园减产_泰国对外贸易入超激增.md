Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th - Indonesian Minister of Agriculture Sadjarwo's remarks prove that the economic crisis in the Western world has caused a decline in the income and output of large Indonesian plantations.

Sadjarwo told the press on the 8th that the output and income of large plantations in 1958 decreased compared to 1957. In particular, the output and income of rubber plantations decreased due to the decline in the prices of certain important raw materials in the international market caused by the economic recession.

Sadjarwo said that it is estimated that the income of large plantations in 1958 will decrease by 600 million to 700 million rupiah compared to 1957. The income in 1957 was about 3 billion rupiah. The export of large plantation products plays an important role in Indonesia's economy. Sadjarwo said that, excluding oil exports, the export of large plantation products accounted for 40% of Indonesia's exports until 1957.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th - Bangkok News: The Permanent Secretary of the Thai Ministry of Economic Affairs, Luan Ta Yin, announced on the 5th that in the first nine months of last year, Thailand's total foreign trade surplus was 1,074,650,000 baht (Thai currency), an increase of 374,930,000 baht compared to the surplus in the same period of 1957.

Under the attack of the economic crisis in capitalist countries, Thailand's foreign trade showed a decline last year. According to Luan Ta Yin, Thailand's total foreign trade in the first nine months of last year was 11,147,580,000 baht, a decrease of 8% compared to the same period in 1957.

    西方经济危机祸延东南亚
    印度尼西亚种植园减产
    泰国对外贸易入超激增
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚农业部长萨雅沃的谈话证明，西方世界的经济危机已经使印度尼西亚大种植园的收入和产量下降。
    萨雅沃8日对报界说，1958年大种植园的产量和收入比1957年减少，特别是橡胶种植园产量和收入减少，是由于经济衰退引起国际市场中某些重要原料价格下跌所造成的。
    萨雅沃说，据估计，1958年大种植园的收入将比1957年减少六亿盾到七亿盾。1957年的收入是三十亿盾左右。大种植园产品的出口在印度尼西亚的经济中起着重要的作用。萨雅沃说，除了石油出口不算以外，到1957年为止，大种植园产品的出口占印度尼西亚出口量的40％。
    新华社9日讯　曼谷消息：泰国经济部常务次长銮他因5日宣布，去年头九个月，泰国对外贸易共入超十亿七千四百六十五万铢（泰币），比1957年同期的入超额增加了三亿七千四百九十三万铢。
    在资本主义国家经济危机的袭击下，泰国去年对外贸易呈现衰退。据銮他因说，泰国去年头九个月的对外贸易总值为一百一十一亿四千七百五十八万铢，比1957年同期减少8％。
