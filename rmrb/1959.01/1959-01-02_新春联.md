New Spring Couplets

The people cheer the people's commune
All the people sing the praises of the motherland's rivers and mountains

Spur the fast horse, persist in leap after leap
Brave the wind and waves, strive for upstream and further upstream

Everyone strives to be a versatile person
Everyone learns to be an all-rounder
