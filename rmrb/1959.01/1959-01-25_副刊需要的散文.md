    Essays Needed for the Supplement
    Quite a few readers have written to ask: Are the essays published in the supplement all true stories, and what kind of essays does the supplement need?
    Generally speaking, essays with specific events, locations, and names should be true stories. If it is not a true story, some necessary processing can be done on the basis of facts. However, no matter which type, the author should have observed and extracted it from actual life.
    The types of essays needed by the supplement are very broad, such as lyrical essays, random notes, letters, diaries, travel notes, etc. In terms of content, everything that writes about new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward and reflects the current features of the motherland's construction is needed. At present, we urgently need sketches that express the deeds and ideological outlook of some advanced figures in production and construction. We especially hope that writers can write some eloquent essays.

    副刊需要的散文
    有不少读者来信问：副刊发表的散文是否都是真人真事，副刊需要哪些散文？
    一般说，散文中凡有具体事件、地点、姓名的都应该是真人真事。如果不是真人真事，就可以在事实的基础上进行某些必要的加工。但，不管是哪一种，作者都应该是从实际生活中观察到和提炼出来的。
    副刊需要的散文方面很广，例如抒情散文、随笔小品、书信、日记、游记等都可以。内容方面凡是写大跃进中新人新事、反映当前祖国建设风貌的，都需要。目前，我们很需要表现生产建设中一些先进人物的事迹和他们的思想面貌的速写。我们特别希望作家们能够动手写一些文情并茂的散文。
