Xinhua News Agency, 30th – As the Spring Festival approaches, various places across the country are extensively launching activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. After a year of the Great Leap Forward, people everywhere are joyfully making arrangements for various activities, preparing to extend greetings to their loved ones.

Launching activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers during the Spring Festival has become a tradition in our country. This year's activities will unfold even more enthusiastically amidst the atmosphere of national joy. Currently, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have made preparations. Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Liaoning, Yunnan, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have established Spring Festival慰问团 (Comfort Groups) composed of people from all walks of life. The Liaoning Province Comfort Group is divided into five sub-groups and has already begun its visits to various places since the 22nd. The comfort groups in various places are mostly led by provincial and municipal party and government leaders and are equipped with a certain number of song and dance troupes, theater troupes, and film projection teams to visit border defense, coastal defense troops, construction troops, local garrisons, homes for disabled veterans, and hospitals for the wounded and sick, and to hold grand army-civilian get-togethers.

Many workers, farmers, and students in various regions have written letters of greetings to the troops. Some families of martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized soldiers in some areas have written to their relatives and comrades in the army, reporting on the progress of local industrial and agricultural production and the new atmosphere after the people's communes. In some places in Sichuan Province, it is planned to invite officers and soldiers of the garrison to attend group worships during the Spring Festival according to local customs, and to organize gatherings, report meetings, or seminars.

While carrying out慰问 (comfort) activities, all localities will also extensively carry out propaganda and education on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers through various means, publicizing the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in safeguarding national security and supporting national construction, publicizing the advanced figures of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers who have emerged in the Great Leap Forward, and commending models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. Many regions plan to organize report meetings and seminars in people's communes, institutions, enterprises, and schools, inviting garrison leaders, active or retired veteran Red Army soldiers, and heroic models to report on the history of revolutionary struggles and exemplary deeds to the people. Guangdong, Jilin, and other places will also mobilize commune members, street residents, and students to do a good deed for local families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans during the Spring Festival.

Some localities plan to organize cadres to慰问 (comfort) families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers in the people's communes before and after the Spring Festival, and effectively help them solve practical difficulties. In order to enable families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers to spend the Spring Festival happily, Qinhuangdao City conducted a thorough inspection of preferential treatment and resettlement work. The city's three districts organized a total of 367 preferential treatment inspection teams to慰问 (comfort) and inspect the living conditions of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers. Residents and students in two districts have collected more than 100,000 jin of firewood for families of martyrs and soldiers. Qinhuangdao City also organized 400 doctors to conduct a general examination of the chronic diseases of disabled and demobilized soldiers and provided them with appropriate resettlement and treatment. The families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled veterans throughout the city were greatly encouraged by the care of the Party and the government, and they wrote more than 1,000 letters to their relatives and comrades at the front, encouraging them to make even greater contributions in defending the motherland.

    军民共庆跃进年
    各地展开拥军优属活动
    新华社30日讯　春节将到，全国各地正在广泛展开拥军优属活动，经过一年的大跃进，各地人民都怀着欣喜愉快的心情积极安排各种活动，准备慰问自己的亲人。
    新春佳节开展拥军优属活动，在我国已经成为一个传统。今年的拥军优属活动，将在全民欢乐的气氛中更为热烈地展开。现在，各省、市、自治区都进行了筹备。浙江、江苏、山东、广东、辽宁、云南、北京、上海等地方，都成立了各界人民春节慰问团。辽宁省慰问团分成五个分团，已从22日开始分赴各地进行慰问。各地的慰问团大都由省、市党政领导人亲自率领，并且分别配备了一定数量的文工团、剧团及电影队等，准备分头向本地区的边防、海防部队，施工部队，当地驻军，残废军人教养院和伤病员进行慰问，并举行盛大的军民联欢活动。
    许多地区的工人、农民、学生向部队写了慰问信，有些地区的烈属、军属和复员军人向部队亲人、战友写了信，向他们报告当地工农业生产跃进的情况以及人民公社化以后的新气象。四川省有些地方在春节期间，准备按照当地习惯，邀请驻军官兵举行团拜，并且组织联欢会、报告会或座谈会。
    各地在开展慰问活动的同时，还将通过各种方式，广泛开展拥军优属的宣传教育工作，宣扬人民解放军在保卫祖国安全和支援国家建设的丰功伟绩，宣扬烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人在大跃进中涌现出来的先进人物，表扬拥军优属工作模范。许多地区准备以人民公社或机关、企业、学校为单位，组织报告会、座谈会等，邀请驻军首长、在职或退休老红军以及功臣模范，向人民群众报告革命斗争历史和模范事迹。广东、吉林等地在春节期间，还将发动公社社员、街道居民、学生为当地烈属、军属和残废军人做一件好事。
    有的地方准备在春节前后组织干部对人民公社内的烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人逐户进行慰问，切实帮助他们解决实际困难问题。秦皇岛市为了使烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人欢度春节，深入地进行了优抚复员工作大检查，这个市有三个区共组织了三百六十七个优抚检查小组，逐户慰问和检查了烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人的生活情况。有两个区的群众和学生已经给烈军属拾柴草十多万斤。秦皇岛市还组织了四百名医生普遍检查了残废、复员军人的慢性病情况，并使他们得到了适当的安置和治疗。全市烈军属和残废军人对党和政府的关怀感到极大鼓舞，他们给前线亲人、战友写出一千多封信，鼓舞他们在保卫祖国中立更大的功劳。
