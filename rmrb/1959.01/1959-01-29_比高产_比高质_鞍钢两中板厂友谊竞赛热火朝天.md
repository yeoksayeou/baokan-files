Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 28th: In order to ensure the realization of an even greater leap forward plan this year, the two Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills of the same type of work - the First and Second Medium Plate Factories - have launched a heated competition, thereby rapidly increasing the output, quality and variety of steel plates. From New Year's Day to the 25th, the First Medium Plate Factory has increased production by 2,070 tons of steel plate, and the Second Medium Plate Factory has also increased production by 2,064 tons.

The workers of the First Medium Plate Factory are running at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward. At the beginning of the new year, all the workers of this factory discussed and summarized the experience of the two high-yield weeks in December last year, and immediately launched a high-yield, high-quality, multi-variety production increase campaign. They made great efforts in technical revolution, overcame the weak links of unstable quality and low output of the rolling mill when rolling thin steel plates. In the first half of the month, they not only completed the variety plan, but also produced more than 1,174 tons of steel plates.

The workers of the Second Medium Plate Factory repeatedly studied and learned from the experience of the First Medium Plate Factory, put forward the slogan "Learn from the First Medium Plate Factory, Catch up with the First Medium Plate Factory", and launched a high-yield week campaign, increasing steel plate production by more than 1,000 tons in seven days.

When the news that the Second Medium Plate Factory had caught up came to the First Medium Plate Factory, it gave the workers of the First Medium Plate Factory great encouragement and supervision. They warmly congratulated the winners of the competition on the one hand, and on the other hand expressed their determination to fight the Second Medium Plate Factory again. On the 24th, the workers of this factory indeed created the highest record of daily rolling of multi-variety steel plates; among them, the C shift workers rolled 720 pieces of 12 mm thick steel plates in eight hours, exceeding the highest shift output record of the Second Medium Plate Factory. At present, this friendly competition is still going on enthusiastically. (Attached picture)

### 比高产  比高质  鞍钢两中板厂友谊竞赛热火朝天

    比高产  比高质
    鞍钢两中板厂友谊竞赛热火朝天
    新华社鞍山28日电　鞍钢两个同工种的轧钢厂——第一和第二中板厂为保证实现今年更大的跃进计划，展开了热火朝天的竞赛，从而使钢板的产量、质量和品种都迅速提高。从元旦到25日，第一中板厂已增产了二千零七十吨钢板，第二中板厂也同样增产了二千零六十四吨。
    第一中板厂的职工跑在跃进的前列。新年一开头，这个厂的全体职工就讨论总结了去年12月份两次高产周的经验，并且立即开展了高产量、高质量、多品种的增产运动。他们大闹技术革命，克服了轧钢机在轧制薄钢板时质量不稳定、产量低的薄弱环节，上半个月不仅完成了品种计划，而且还多生产一千一百七十四吨钢板。
    第二中板厂的职工反复研究和学习了第一中板厂的经验，提出了“学习一中板、赶上一中板”的口号，开展了高产周运动，七天内就增产钢板一千多吨。
    当第二中板厂后来居上的消息传到第一中板厂时，给了第一中板厂的职工们很大的鼓舞和督促，他们一面热烈向竞赛优胜者祝贺，一面提出决心要同第二中板厂再战一场。24日，这个厂的职工果然又创造了日轧多品种钢板的最高纪录；其中丙班工人八小时内轧出了十二公厘厚的钢板七百二十块，超过了第二中板厂最高班产量纪录。现在，这场友谊竞赛还在继续热烈地进行着。（附图片）
