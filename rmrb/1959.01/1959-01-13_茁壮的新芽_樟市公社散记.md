Vigorous New Sprouts
—Notes from Zhangshi Commune
Zhang Tao, Ding Xinren

Having heard good things about the Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, we visited this commune on a bright, sunny morning, December 18th. The commune had only been established for eight months. In the history of the commune's development, it could only be considered a newborn infant. However, in the short time we visited here, we could already see the infinite vitality displayed by a young commune. From the growth of this commune, we saw that our country's more than twenty-six thousand communes would, or already had, emit dazzling brilliance just like Zhangshi Commune.

Not Enough Warehouses

When we visited the commune, it was a good time of "ten thousand people singing the praises of the commune, and the walls covered with poems and paintings celebrating the bumper harvest." Everywhere we could see a scene of prosperity and vitality. That day, the commune members we met, regardless of gender or age, couldn't stop talking about the good things about the People's Commune. Compared to 1957, the late rice yield here did not double, but increased elevenfold. Xu Jianxin, a humorous commune member who loved honor and the collective, wrote a bumper harvest folk song for us that day: "Late rice has a great harvest, the commune members are happy, there are not enough warehouses, the director is worried." Due to the great grain harvest, all the large and small granaries here were filled to the brim. The higher authorities had sent an inspection team to weigh and inspect the grain, which took them half a month of hard work to complete.

Large-Scale Construction

Hearing about the situation of the commune's industrial construction was also truly inspiring. As we sped along the flat highway, a commune cadre told us an interesting story. He said: Building a highway has been the long-held wish of the people of Zhangshi. This highway, which stretches fifteen *li* to Zhangshi, was built by mobilizing four thousand commune members to work hard for two days and nights. Upon hearing that a highway was to be built here, Chen Jiubo, who was in his sixties, shook his head in disbelief: "Building a highway is that simple? Without machines, and crossing mountains and ridges, see when you will be able to build it." Who knew that only a few days later, trucks were already driving all the way behind Chen Jiubo's house. This startled Chen Jiubo: "Oh dear, the trucks have really come, the commune is amazing, what they said they did."

Soon after, this highway extended to the steep mountains. Trucks transported loads of wood to the Zhangshi fair, where large-scale construction was underway.

Relieving One's Mind
Picking Up One's Heart

After the commune was built, what changes did the lives of the commune members undergo? When reporters arrived at the deep plowing land of the Yuanchangying Satellite Company, we quickly got the answer. There, people were using a new type of tool, which involved tying planks to the harrow. This made the efficiency of leveling the soil five or six times faster than ordinary harrows, and the entire company therefore completed the deep plowing task ahead of schedule and above quota. We learned that the creator of this fast harrow was called Zhang Dayang. Whether communization is good or not, Zhang Dayang is perhaps the one who feels it most deeply.

Zhang Dayang's family of six, four children and a couple, joined the agricultural cooperative. Although they worked actively, their lives were much better than before, but due to the lack of labor, they were still overdrawn by dozens of yuan every year. Last April, the People's Commune was established, and his whole family ate in the public canteen. The four children were also sent to the nursery and kindergarten. The couple were free from worries and actively engaged in production. After September, the commune paid wages three times, and the couple received more than thirty yuan in total. With this, the whole family added new clothes, and Zhang Dayang also bought a pair of new rubber shoes. From then on, Zhang Dayang worked with all his might. As he said, he relieved one's mind and picked up one's heart, and from then on, he focused on production.

When deep plowing began this year, he successfully tested the above-mentioned soil leveling tool for the first time, which greatly improved labor efficiency.

She is not a quarrelsome person

Women talked even more about the benefits the commune brought them.

One evening, we met Pan Yasan in the company's club. In the past, she was known for often quarreling with her husband. That night, she told us about her life with a constant smile, and we immediately felt that she was not a quarrelsome person at all.

"In the past, my husband and I had four children. When Wenming (her husband's name) came back at night, there was no food to eat, and the children were crying, so he would scold me. I thought to myself, I get up before dawn and do several big things, such as starting the fire, picking vegetables, cooking, carrying water, and taking care of the children, so I'm late for work. At noon and in the evening, I have to repeat these things, and also raise pigs, water vegetables, and wash clothes. I'm already upset after worrying about these things all day, and Wenming still says I don't go to meetings and scolds me for being backward. There are really few good words between husband and wife. I don't know how many times I've cried because of this." Speaking of now, Pan Yasan was even happier. Now, she goes to work every day after washing her face. After eating in the canteen in the evening and taking a shower, she goes to meetings if there are any, and goes to bed early if there aren't. She focuses on production wholeheartedly during the day, without worries, and feels refreshed, just thinking about how to strive for the upper reaches. Then, she praised her husband in front of us: "Now when we go home at night, Wenming always encourages me to lead the production team well. I also often discuss the next day's work with him. Quarrels have never happened again. The two of us discuss everything, and this is the first time in many years of marriage."

Many families we visited had similar experiences to Pan Yasan's family; many women had also experienced the same path as Pan Yasan.

More women customers

Fresh things are always endless:

One market day, we passed by the department store and saw groups of women crowded in front of the counters, choosing floral headscarves and floral clothes. In the past, women rarely acted as buyers themselves, because they didn't handle money. As they said: In the past, recording work points was like a bottle drawn on the wall, "you can look but can't take." Now they put their own private seals and receive money themselves, and buy whatever they want. Wu Xizhi, who has six children, received a total of more than twenty yuan in wages after three wage payments since September last year. Each of the eight members of her family, two adults and six children, made a new set of clothes. The sixty-year-old grandma Huang Yamei received seven yuan, but she was reluctant to buy anything for herself and made a set of clothes for each of her two grandsons. Squad leader Chen Wenming's family of six went to the company to buy new clothes. He suggested that his wife buy a set of floral fabric, but Pan Yasan disagreed. She said that this time she would buy black first, which is convenient for working, and next time she gets paid she will buy a set of floral fabric.

Company cadre Liao Jinling complained to us: Commune members make suggestions every day, saying that there is not enough cloth to sell, and it takes too long to make clothes, and they can't buy ready-made clothes. In fact, our clothing processing factory has added five people, and they are still working hard day and night, but they still can't keep up.

Canteen Scene

One noon, we went to the Yuanchang squad canteen for lunch. Two things immediately attracted us. One was that a large stove was placed on each table; the other was the diverse and varied snack bar, where there were chicken eggs, duck eggs, goose eggs, preserved meat, fermented bean curd, chili sauce, etc. In addition, the canteen also cooked custom dishes. We asked the canteen manager if there were many people adding dishes here? He said that after the wages were paid, even baskets of eggs were not enough to sell.

After the meal, a group of women and old people scrambled to tell us about the benefits of the canteen: When grandma Huang Yamei was sick at home, cook Lin Ya personally cooked porridge and noodles and sent them to her. The child in the arms of female commune member Ou Lian was the first little citizen born in Yuanchang squad after the establishment of the commune. The happy mother introduced the canteen's meticulous care for pregnant women. After she gave birth to her child, the canteen gave her several chickens and dozens of eggs according to regulations. The cook also specially stewed chicken with rice wine for her to eat. Ou Lian said that at the time she was afraid that the canteen would not take care of her when she gave birth, but it was really unnecessary. She said: This is my third and most blessed son. When I gave birth to my first two children, I could only eat fried ginger rice and pickled vegetables.

"The People's Commune is good!" Every day we stayed in Zhangshi Commune, every event we heard and saw, every number, every ordinary commune member, made us deeply feel that this was not just black and white on paper, but a living, irrefutable reality.

    茁壮的新芽
    ——樟市公社散记
    张涛　丁辛人
    欣闻广东省韶关市郊区樟市人民公社的好名声，12月18日，一个阳光耀目的早晨，我们访问了这个公社。公社成立不过八个月，在公社发展的历史上它只算得上个刚出生的婴孩，但是，就我们在这里访问的短短的日子，已经可以看到一个年轻的公社所显示出来的无穷的生命力。从这个公社的成长，我们看到了我国两万六千多个公社都将要或已经像樟市公社一样发出夺目的光辉。
    仓库不够用
    当我们访问公社的时候，正是“万人同唱公社好，满墙诗画庆丰收”的好时光。到处都可以看到欣欣向荣，万物皆春的一片兴旺景色。那天，我们碰到的社员，不论男女老幼，同我们谈不尽人民公社的好话。比起1957年，这里的晚稻增产不是翻一番，而是增产了十一倍。爱荣誉、爱集体而富有幽默感的社员徐建新，那天便写了一首丰收歌谣送给我们：“晚稻大丰收，社员喜心头，仓库不够用，社长发了愁。”由于粮食大丰收，这里所有的大小粮仓都填得满满的。上级曾经派过一个验收团来过秤验收，足足苦战了半个月才算把谷子称完。
      大兴土木
    听了公社工业建设的情形，也实在叫人振奋。当我们奔驰在平坦的公路上时，社干部告诉我们一件趣事。他说：修公路是樟市人民多年的愿望了。这条通向樟市的长达十五里的公路，就是公社成立后，发动四千个社员苦战一天两夜筑成的。听说这里要修公路，六十多岁的陈九伯便不信地摇头：“修公路那么简单？没有机器，又要过山越岭，看你们何年何月才修成。”谁知才隔了几天，大汽车已经嘟嘟地一直开到陈九伯的屋背后了。这可把陈九伯吓了一跳：“唉呀，汽车真的来了，公社真了不起，说到做到。”
    不久以后这条公路又伸展到峻峭的大山上。汽车将一车车的木材运到正在大兴土木的樟市圩上。
    放下一条心
      提起一条心
    公社建成后，社员的生活究竟起了什么变化呢？当记者到达源昌营卫星连的深翻地上，我们很快便得到答案了。在那里，人们正在使用一种新式工具。就是将木板绑在耙上，这样平土的效率比普通的耙要快上五、六倍，全连深翻任务因此提前超额完成。我们打听到这个快速耙的创造者叫张大洋。公社化好不好，这里要算张大洋体会得最亲切了。
    张大洋一家六口，四个小孩和夫妇两口，加入农业社后，虽然积极劳动，生活比过去好多了，但终因劳动力少，年年超支几十元。去年4月，人民公社成立，他的全家都在公共食堂吃饭了，四个小孩又送到了托儿所和幼儿班，两夫妇无牵无挂地积极生产，9月以后公社发了三次工资，两夫妇共领回了三十多元。这下子一家人都添置了新衣，张大洋还买了一双新胶鞋。从此，张大洋干起活来，真是浑身是劲。像他说的，是放下一条心，拿起一条心，从此一心搞生产了。
    今年深翻开始时，他一次试验成功了上述的平土工具，大大提高了劳动效率。
  她不是爱吵架的人
    妇女们谈起公社带给她们的好处就更多了。
    一天晚上，我们在连的俱乐部里见到潘亚三。过去，她是以同丈夫经常吵架而出名的。这天晚上，她笑不停口地向我们叙述了她的生活，我们立即感到，她根本不是一个爱吵架的人。
    “过去，我们两夫妇带着四个小孩，晚上文名（她的丈夫的名字）回来，没有饭吃，孩子又哭，就骂我，我想，我天不亮就起床，干完起火、摘菜、煮饭、担水、带小孩几件大事，出工就晚了。中午晚上，还要重复地干这几件事，还有养猪、浇菜、洗衣服。一天操了这份心，已经是心烦意乱，文名还说我不去开会，骂我是落后分子。夫妻之间，确是没有几句好话讲的，为了这些，我不知哭了多少回。”谈到现在，潘亚三更高兴了。现在，每天洗完脸就出工，晚上去食堂吃过饭，洗完澡，有会开就开会，没会开就早点睡觉。白天一条心搞生产，无忧无虑，心神爽快，只想怎样争上游。接着，她在我们面前称赞了自己的丈夫：“现在我们晚上回家，文名总爱鼓励我领导好生产组。我也经常和他研究第二天的工作。吵架再也没有发生过了。两个人有商有量，结婚多年，这还是第一次呢。”
    我们访问过的许多家庭，都有过像潘亚三家庭的遭遇；许多妇女，同样经历过潘亚三的道路。
  妇女顾客多起来了
    新鲜事情总是说不完：
    在一个圩日里，我们路经百货公司，只见成群的妇女挤在货柜前面选购花头巾和花衣服。过去，妇女是很少自己当买主的，因为钱财不过手。正如她们说的：以前记工分是墙上画的瓶，“有看没拿”。现在是自己盖私章自己领钱，想买什么就买什么了。有六个小孩的吴细忮去年9月以后三次发工资，一共发了二十多元工资，一家两大六小每人都做了一套新衣服。六十多岁的老婆婆黄亚梅领到七元钱，自己舍不得买东西，替两个孙子各做了一套衣服。排长陈文名阖家大小六人到公司买新衣，他建议妻子买套花布的，但潘亚三不同意，她说这次先买黑的，做工方便，下次发工资再买套花的。
    公司干部廖锦灵向我们诉苦：社员天天提意见，说布不够卖，做衣服的时间又太久了，买不到成衣。其实我们的服装加工厂已经增加了五个人，日夜苦战还是做不来。
      食堂景象
    一天中午，我们到源昌排食堂吃午饭。有两件事马上吸引了我们，一件是每张桌子上都放上了一个大火炉；一件是多式多样的小卖部，那里有鸡蛋、鸭蛋、鹅蛋、腊肉、豆腐乳、辣椒酱等，此外食堂还代煮客菜。我们问食堂经理，这里加菜的人多不多？他说发放工资后，成箩鸡蛋都不够卖呢？
    饭后，一群妇女和老人争着向我们念叨食堂的好处：老婆婆黄亚梅卧病在家时，炊事员林亚就亲自煮了粥、粉送给她吃。女社员欧莲怀里抱着的小孩，是公社成立后，在源昌排出生的第一个小公民，幸福的母亲介绍了食堂对孕妇无微不至的照顾。她生产孩子后，食堂按规定给她送来几只鸡，几十个鸡蛋，炊事员还特地替她用黄酒炖鸡来吃。欧莲说，当时我还怕生小孩食堂没照顾，这真是白操心了。她说：这是我生第三个也是最有福气的儿子了，我在生前两个小孩时，只能吃到炒姜饭和头菜呢。
      “人民公社好”！我们在樟市公社逗留的每一天，耳闻目见的每一件事，每一个数字，每一个普通的社员，都使我们深刻地感到，这已经不是白纸上的黑字，而是活生生的、无可辩驳的现实。
