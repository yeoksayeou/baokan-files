    The Plot of Intervention is Bound to Fail
    We protest with extreme anger against American imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs!
    The Cuban people, through heroic struggle, overthrew the Batista dictatorial regime, which was fostered single-handedly by American imperialism, and embarked on the path of national independence. This fact demonstrates that the flames of opposition to imperialism, opposition to colonialism, and the struggle for national independence have already ignited in the "backyard" that American imperialism has always considered stable. The progressive people of the whole world feel immense joy and encouragement at the victory of the Cuban people, and give it full sympathy and support. Only the utterly vicious American imperialism feels dissatisfied and panicked, attempting to find excuses to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cuban people. We express our utmost indignation at this unreasonable behavior of the United States.
    American imperialism's actions to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs mean that it has put on a new noose. It handed the other end of the noose to the Cuban people, and the Cuban people will not let go. All righteous people resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle to safeguard independence and freedom. We firmly believe that the Cuban people's struggle will surely be victorious, and the American interventionists will surely be battered and bloodied!

    干涉阴谋必败
    我们以极其愤怒的心情抗议美帝国主义干涉古巴的内政！
    古巴人民经过英勇的斗争推翻了美帝国主义一手豢养起来的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，走上了民族独立的道路。这个事实说明了：反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的烈火已经在美帝国主义一向认为稳定的“后院”中燃烧起来了。对于古巴人民的胜利，全世界进步人类感到莫大的欢欣鼓舞，并给它以完全的同情和支持。只有穷凶极恶的美帝国主义感到不满和惊慌，企图找寻借口干涉古巴人民的内政，我们对美国的这种无理的行径表示极大的愤慨。
    美帝国主义干涉古巴内政的行动，意味着它又套上了一个新的绞索。它把绞索的另一头交给了古巴人民，古巴人民是不会松手的。一切正义的人民都坚决支持古巴人民维护独立自由的斗争。我们坚信，古巴人民的斗争一定胜利，美国干涉者一定碰得头破血流！
