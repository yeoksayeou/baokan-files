    A Red Banner for Technical Reform in Pastoral Areas
    By our reporter Bai Shulian

    On the snowy grasslands of the Evenk Autonomous Banner in the Hulunbuir League, the brilliant flowers of the technical revolution are in full bloom. Evenk, Mongolian, Daur, and other ethnic herders, combining revolutionary zeal with a scientific spirit, are creatively organizing a new year's Great Leap Forward.

    As you approach the reed-filled banks of the Xini River, Hui River, and Yimin River, you will be drawn to a scene of winter harvesting. There, herders are driving horse-drawn mowing machines, busily harvesting reeds. The herders told me that this year they plan to harvest tens of thousands of tons of reeds to supply paper mills in Yingkou and other places. Because harvesting with sickles was too inefficient, they boldly reformed the horse-drawn mowing machines to cut reeds. Now, one person driving a mower can cut seven or eight hectares per day, an efficiency increase of eight or nine times compared to using a sickle. The baskets and clothing used by herders to clear livestock manure are now also being replaced by advanced tools. In some winter camps, a wooden automatic unloading vehicle has appeared, responsible for transporting garbage and livestock manure. This is a high-efficiency tool for accumulating fertilizer and transporting it, created by herders in the process of accumulating fertilizer to support agricultural production and carrying out patriotic health campaigns. The lele cart, which has been used for thousands of years, was previously thought to have no room for improvement. Now, herders have liberated their minds and boldly innovated. The first batch of lele carts with roller bearings has already appeared on the grasslands. Because it has become agile and light, its carrying capacity has increased by more than two times. If people are careful, they can also see animal-powered vehicles on the grasslands of the Evenk Autonomous Banner that can travel on snow, dry land, and in rivers. If the axles of this vehicle are removed and placed in another fixed position, it can be used as a sled in winter; in summer, it can be used as a small boat in the water. People call it the "three-purpose vehicle," and it is very popular. Anyone familiar with pastoral life probably knows that several inches of snow on the grassland can often take the lives of livestock or drive herders away from ideal pastures. To overcome this natural disaster, herders have created a wooden snow breaker that can open up enough pasture for grazing five or six hundred livestock per day. What is a blizzard?

    If you visit a herder's home, you will find many folding bowl racks, folding tables and chairs, folding grassland beds, and other multi-purpose household items in their yurts. When these items are folded, they are just a piece of wood or a few planks. When needed, they can be propped up to become a bed for sleeping, a desk, a dining table, or a small cabinet. For herders who frequently move Aoter (pastures), moving their homes is extremely convenient.

    These days, herders in each Sumu of the Evenk Autonomous Banner are gathering the tools they have created and reformed from all corners of the grasslands to Nantun, the seat of the Banner. The Banner's iron and wood factory is also working overtime to produce physical objects and models. Among these tools are wooden grass pushers, grass stackers, wooden-set ploughs, fast sleds, amphibious boats, and other pastoral production tools, as well as clever and lightweight folding wardrobes, beds, chairs, and various other grassland living utensils. A pastoral area tool reform on-site conference will be held here soon. People can see how great wisdom and creativity the people of the grasslands possess.

    Wu Liansheng (Evenk) and Batu, experts in renovating pastoral production tools, told me that when the Party put forward the task of technological revolution last year, many people, including themselves, did not know how to proceed and lacked confidence. However, after the leadership of the Banner Party Committee and a visit to the Beijing Agricultural Tool Reform Exhibition, they realized that with only three or four thousand laborers in the entire Banner, it would be impossible to achieve a Great Leap Forward without carrying out a technical revolution. Therefore, they dared to think and dared to act, actively participating in the tool reform movement. They each created four or five to seven or eight new tools. Last year, Wu Liansheng and others exhibited their fast sleds, folding grassland beds, and six other tools at the Agricultural Tool Reform Exhibition in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    Recently, the Hulunbuir League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also organized three levels of cadres from pastoral areas to visit the Evenk Autonomous Banner. Some cadres said after the visit: "I used to think that herders had poor creative abilities and that pastoral tools had no value for reform and could only be eliminated. Therefore, I never dared to think about the problem of tool reform in my area. In the future, I will learn from the Evenk Autonomous Banner." Many areas have requested that the most urgently needed new tools be quickly promoted. To commend the achievements of the Evenk Autonomous Banner, the Hulunbuir League Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hulunbuir League Commissioner's Office specially awarded them a banner inscribed with: "Hold high the red banner of tool reform in pastoral areas and advance!"

    牧区技术改革的一面红旗
    本报记者　白树廉
    在白雪皑皑的呼伦贝尔盟鄂温克族自治旗草原上，正在盛开着灿烂的技术革命的花朵。鄂温克、蒙古、达斡尔等民族牧民把革命干劲和科学精神结合起来，创造性地组织着新的一年的大跃进。
    当你走到芦苇丛生的锡尼河、辉河、伊敏河畔，便会被一种冬季收割景象所吸引。在那里牧人们驾驶着马拉打草机在紧张地收割芦苇。牧民们告诉我，今年要打几万吨芦苇，供应营口等造纸厂的需要，因为用镰刀割效率太低，他们就大胆地改革马拉打草机来打芦苇，现在一个人驾驶一台打草机每天可以割七、八公顷，比用镰刀割效率提高了八、九倍。牧民清除牲畜粪便的筐篓和衣襟，现在也开始被先进的工具代替了。在一些冬营地上已经出现一种木制自动卸货车，担负着运输垃圾和牲畜粪便的工作，这是牧民在积肥支援农业生产和开展爱国卫生运动中创造的高效率积肥和运输工具。已经沿袭使用了千百年的勒勒车，在过去谁也没有想到它还会有什么进步，现在，牧民思想解放，大胆革新，第一批滚珠轴承化的勒勒车已经在草原上出现了，因为它变得灵巧轻快，它的载重能力比过去提高了两倍多。如果人们细心一些，在鄂温克族自治旗草原上还能看到可以在雪地、旱路和河水里行驶的兽力车。如果把这个车的轴轮卸下放在另一个固定的位置上，那么在冬季就可以做爬犁用；夏季在水里就可以当小船用。人们称它为“三用车”，很受欢迎。熟悉牧区生活的人大概都知道，草原上盈尺的积雪常常可以夺去牲畜的生命，或把牧民从理想的牧场上赶走。为了战胜这种自然灾害，牧民们已经创造出一种木制破雪器，它每天可以开辟足够放牧五六百头牲畜的牧草场，暴风雪算了什么呢。
    如果到牧民家里做客，人们会在他们的蒙古包里发现好多折叠式碗架、折叠式桌椅、折叠式草地床等一式多用的生活用具。这些用具，把它们折叠起来，就是一块木头或几块木板；根据需要把它支撑起来，就可以成为睡觉的床、写字台、饭桌或小柜橱等。对于经常走敖特尔（移场放牧）的牧民，搬起家来方便极了。
    这几天，鄂温克族自治旗各苏木牧民们正从草原各个角落往旗所在地——南屯集中自己创造改革的工具，旗铁木工厂也在加紧赶制实物和模型。在这些工具中，有木制推草机、垛草机、木套耕田犁、快爬犁、水陆两用船等牧业生产工具和灵巧、轻便的折叠式立柜、床、椅等各种各样的草地生活用具。一个牧区工具改革现场会议将要在这里召开。人们可以看到草原上的人们具有多么伟大的智慧和创造能力。
    牧业生产工具的革新能手武连生（鄂温克族）、巴图等告诉我，去年党提出技术革命任务时，连他们自己在内，许多人都不知怎样进行，没有信心，但由于旗委的领导和参观北京农具改革展览会以后，认识到在全旗只有三、四千名劳动力的情况下，不开展技术革命，就无法实现大跃进的道理，因此就敢想、敢干，积极地投入了工具改革运动。他们每人都创造了四、五种到七、八种新工具。去年在内蒙古自治区农具改革展览会上，武连生等曾展出了自己的快爬犁、折叠式草地床等六种工具。
    最近中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会还组织牧区三级干部到鄂温克族自治旗进行了参观。有的干部参观以后说：“我过去认为牧民的创造能力差，牧区工具没有改革的价值，只好淘汰，因此对自己地区工具改革问题想都未敢想，今后要向鄂温克族自治旗学习”。许多地区都要求把当前最急需的新式工具迅速加以推广。中共呼伦贝尔盟委员会和呼伦贝尔盟公署为了表彰鄂温克族自治旗的成绩，特地奖给他们一面锦旗，上面写着：“高举牧区工具改革红旗前进！”
