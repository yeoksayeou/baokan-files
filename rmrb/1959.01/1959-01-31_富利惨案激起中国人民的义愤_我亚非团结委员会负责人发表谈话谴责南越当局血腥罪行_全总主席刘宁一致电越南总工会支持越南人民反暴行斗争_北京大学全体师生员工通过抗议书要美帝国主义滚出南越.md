Xinhua News Agency, January 30th - The person in charge of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee issued a statement today protesting the bloody crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities in their large-scale massacre of Vietnamese patriots. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The recent incident of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, supported by U.S. imperialism, massacring Vietnamese patriotic figures on a large scale has aroused the boundless anger of all the Chinese people. The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee firmly condemns and protests the bloody crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities.

    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese authorities have consistently violated the armistice agreement and the Geneva Accords, obstructing the Vietnamese people from realizing the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world. The incident of massacring more than a thousand Vietnamese patriotic figures at the Phu Loi concentration camp once again exposes the ugly face of the United States' interference in the internal affairs of the Vietnamese people and the inhumane behavior of the South Vietnamese authorities. This cannot but arouse the serious condemnation and opposition of peace-loving and righteous people of all countries. We, the Chinese people, fully sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the barbaric atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities and the Vietnamese people's just struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The South Vietnamese authorities must account for this bloody atrocity. The American aggressors must get out of South Vietnam. We firmly believe that the cause of the Vietnamese people's reunification of their motherland will surely be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, January 30th - Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, today sent a telegram to Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, expressing support for the protest demonstrations launched by the Vietnamese people to protest the large-scale massacre of patriots by the South Vietnamese authorities.

    The telegram stated that the Chinese working class learned with boundless anger of the heinous crimes of the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, instigated by U.S. imperialism, in massacring former Vietnamese resistance personnel and patriots on a large scale. This outrageous act of large-scale massacre once again thoroughly exposed the madness and bestiality of the South Vietnamese authorities and their master, U.S. imperialism. On behalf of all Chinese workers, I firmly protest this fascist and terrorist crime of the South Vietnamese authorities and express firm support for the unprecedented mass protest demonstrations launched throughout Vietnam.

    The telegram stated that the South Vietnamese executioners who massacred Vietnamese patriots cannot escape the net of the people's justice. Truth and justice are on the side of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people, in their struggle against the atrocities of the South Vietnamese reactionary ruling clique, will receive the unanimous support of peace-loving and righteous people all over the world.

Xinhua News Agency, January 30th - More than a thousand teachers and students of Peking University held a rally tonight to protest the bloody atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities in massacring Vietnamese patriots. Vietnamese students and other foreign students studying at the university also participated in the meeting.

    Vietnamese student Ye Tinghua made an accusation at the meeting about the crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, under the protection and support of U.S. imperialism, in massacring more than a thousand Vietnamese patriots. Ye Tinghua's accusation aroused the boundless anger of those present at the meeting towards the U.S.-Ngo group, and they unanimously shouted: "Protest the monstrous crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities!" "Resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people!"

    Following this, representatives of Peking University faculty and staff, Professor Zheng Xin, director of the Philosophy Department, and student representatives Zhang Dian, a student of the Vietnamese Department of the Department of Eastern Languages, spoke. They said that the interests of the Vietnamese people are our interests, the disaster of the Vietnamese people is our disaster, the struggle of the Vietnamese people is just, and the Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Representatives of students from the Soviet Union, India, Ceylon, France and other countries also unanimously protested the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities at the meeting and supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Students from Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Denmark, Nepal, Norway, Spain and other countries also wrote protest letters separately or jointly.

    The meeting finally passed a protest letter from all teachers, students and staff of Peking University against the bloody atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities in massacring Vietnamese patriots. Firmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The protest letter said: "We demand that the Vietnam International Commission investigate the Phu Loi collective massacre incident and demand the immediate dissolution of the South Vietnamese death camps. The atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique must be stopped. U.S. imperialism must get out of South Vietnam!"

    电报说，屠杀越南爱国者的南越刽子手，是不能逃脱人民的法网的。真理和正义在越南人民这一边。越南人民在反对南越反动统治集团暴行的斗争中，将获得全世界爱好和平和有正义感的人民的一致支持。
    新华社30日讯　北京大学一千多名师生今晚集会抗议南越当局屠杀越南爱国者的血腥暴行。在这个大学学习的越南留学生和其他国家的留学生也都参加了大会。

    大会最后通过了北大全体师生员工对南越当局屠杀越南爱国者血腥暴行的抗议书。坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争。抗议书说：“我们要求越南国际委员会进行调查富利集体屠杀事件，要求立即解散南越死亡营。吴庭艳集团的暴行必须制止。美帝必须滚出南越去！”
