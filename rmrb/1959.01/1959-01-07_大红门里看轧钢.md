Watching Steel Rolling in Dahongmen
By Our Correspondent Zhang Huixian

	In June, on a large open space in the southwest corner of Dahongmen in Beijing's southern suburbs, stood three warehouses full of pesticides, and the croaking of frogs could be heard from the surrounding reeds. But by October, a steel rolling mill, booming and clanging all day long, had sprung up here, and the three warehouses had been transformed into workshops producing square steel, round steel, flat steel, rebar, sheet metal, silicon steel sheets... This is the Dahongmen Steel Rolling Mill, capable of producing tens of thousands of tons of steel annually.

	Why was this factory built in just three months at a cost of only 10,008 yuan?

	Factory Director Bian Xinfu, who used to be an auto mechanic in Yan'an, told the reporter: "Rolling steel into steel products is always done by people. Before there was steel, no one could roll steel. We used this ambition to overcome many difficulties and build the steel rolling mill in a simple and crude way. Now the output and quality of steel are gradually improving."

	When Bian Xinfu led more than a hundred handicraft workers to prepare for the construction of the steel rolling mill, he was met with opposition and ridicule from some people. Some said, "Forget it, how can you people who knock and cut scissors run a steel rolling mill!" Others said, "You want to roll steel, have you ever even seen steel rolling?" Some even pointed to their heads and bet, "If you can build the factory, I'll cut off my head..."

	In the face of difficulties, the workers who were preparing to build the factory did not waver. The Party branch analyzed the situation realistically, studied the difficulties and ways to overcome them, and decided to focus on solving the three key issues of equipment, factory construction, and training technical personnel.

	A tense battle began. Some workers moved the pesticides out of the warehouse, some went to the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives to find an unwanted, broken steel rolling mill, and some started building heating furnaces. At the same time, Bian Xinfu, with the approval of higher authorities, invited engineer Qiao Dezhen from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology to search for old, unused steel rolling mill parts in Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Lushun, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant gave an old steel rolling mill stand, and Sujiatun Nonferrous Metals Processing Plant gave eighteen rollers and a set of rolling mill frames... In this way, the equipment needed for a plant with an annual output of tens of thousands of tons of steel was largely assembled.

	The construction of the Dahongmen Steel Rolling Mill encountered new twists and turns. Some people believed that the geological conditions here were too poor; brick and wood structures were fine for warehouses, but for rolling steel, new factory buildings should be built. The workers carried out a realistic analysis. They said: to prevent fire, the heating furnace can be built outside the workshop; the poor soil can be filled with good soil. In this way, the construction speed was greatly accelerated.

	In order to speed up the construction of the factory, all the workers organized many shock brigades. Bian Xinfu worked with the workers to lay the foundations and bury the cables, and wherever there were more difficulties, he rushed there. One night, everyone was laying the foundations when they suddenly encountered quicksand. If they rested, the quicksand would quickly fill the excavated foundations. At this critical moment, the factory director and the workers immediately decided to overcome the quicksand and decided to use mixed soil to fill the foundations. During the most intense period of factory construction, the factory director and the workers all slept in the workshop and office, and no one was willing to go home. In this way, they transformed the three warehouses into workshops, built six heating furnaces, and installed all the electrical equipment in one month.

	More than thirty young handicraft workers diligently studied and practiced in steel rolling mills in Taiyuan, Tianjin, and other places, and learned steel rolling techniques in just over two months that would normally take a year to learn. When Communist Youth League member Yu Qinming and others went to the steel rolling workshop of Taiyuan Steel Plant to study, it was the hot summer. The workers in the steel rolling workshop worked for half an hour and rested for half an hour, but Yu Qinming and others used their rest time to study techniques such as pulling iron, rear-hand rolling, front-hand rolling, and gate operation. The oil sludge under the rolling mill was full, so they jumped into the ditch to scoop out the oil sludge, completely turning themselves into mud men. The veteran workers in the steel rolling workshop of Taiyuan Steel Plant were moved to see the young men from Beijing studying so hard and wrote a big-character poster saying "Truly Workers from Chairman Mao's Side," expressing their determination to teach them in the shortest possible time. With the enthusiastic help of the veteran workers of Taiyuan Steel Plant, they were already able to roll steel skillfully.

	On August 17, the first silicon steel sheet of the Dahongmen Steel Rolling Mill was rolled out, and the workshop immediately burst into cheers, with workers and leading cadres congratulating each other. Soon, square steel, round steel, flat steel, rebar, and other products were also produced. However, the performance of the pieced-together steel rolling mill was difficult to master, the rollers often broke, and the output of steel was not high. Bian Xinfu and technician Zhang Nailiang set out on a second expedition to study steel rolling technology and advanced experience in twenty-one factories in six regions, and as a result, they found the cause of the roller breakage. After returning to the factory, they immediately mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations, installed tracks and trolleys, and made anti-collar discs and head-cutting machines, which greatly reduced physical labor and increased steel output.

### 大红门里看轧钢

    大红门里看轧钢
    本报记者　张慧贤
    6月里，在北京南苑大红门西南角的一大片空地上，矗立着三间满装着农药的仓库，人们还能从周围的芦苇丛中听到青蛙的叫声。进入10月，这里却出现了一个成天轰轰隆隆、铿铿锵锵的轧钢厂，三间仓库变成了生产方钢、圆钢、扁钢、螺纹钢、薄板、矽钢片……的车间。这就是能年产好几万吨钢材的大红门轧钢厂。
    为什么这个厂只用了一万零八元，三个月就建成了呢？
    曾经在延安当过汽车修理工人的厂长卞心福对记者说：“把钢轧成钢材总是人干的。世界上没有钢材之前，谁也不会轧钢。我们就用这样的雄心，冲破了重重困难，因陋就简地把轧钢厂建设起来。现在钢材产量和质量正在逐步提高。”
    当卞心福领着一百多个手工业工人筹建轧钢厂的时候，曾受到了一些人的反对和嘲笑。有的说：“算了吧，凭你们这些敲打剪刀的能办轧钢厂！”有的说：“你们想轧钢，见过轧钢没有？”有的人甚至指着自己的脑袋打赌：“你们能把工厂建起来，就割我的头……”
    在困难面前，筹建工厂的职工们并没有动摇，党支部实事求是地分析了情况，研究了面临的困难和克服困难的办法，决定抓紧解决设备、建设厂房和培训技术力量的三大关键问题。
    一场紧张的战斗开始了。有的工人从仓库里把农药搬走，有的到全国手工业合作总社找来了一台没有人要的破轧钢机，有的就开工建设加热炉。与此同时，卞心福经过上级批准，邀请北京钢铁工业学院乔德振工程师到沈阳、鞍山、大连、旅顺、上海和天津等地找别人不用的旧轧钢机部件，抚顺重型机器厂给了一台旧的轧钢机架，苏家屯有色金属加工厂给了十八个轧辊和一副轧机匡子………这样，一个年产十几万吨钢材所需要的设备大体上配齐了。
    大红门轧钢厂的建设工程又遇到了新的波折。一些人认为这里的地质情况太坏，砖木结构做仓库还可以，要轧钢，应该盖新厂房。职工们经过实事求是的分析。他们说：怕失火，加热炉可以建在车间外边；土质坏可以用好土垫。这样，建设速度是大大加快了。
    为了加快建厂速度，全厂职工组织了很多突击队。卞心福同工人们一起打地基，埋电缆，那里困难多，他就赶到那里。一天晚上，大家正在打地基，忽然遇到了流沙，如果休息，流沙就会很快填满挖好的地基。在这紧张的时刻，厂长和工人们立刻决定战胜流沙，决定用混合土垫好地基。在建厂最紧张的时候，厂长和工人全睡在车间和办公室里，谁也不肯回家。就这样，他们在一个月内就把三个仓库改成了车间，砌好了六个加热炉，安装好了全部电器设备。
    三十多个年轻的手工业工人，在太原、天津等地的轧钢厂里勤学苦练，只用两个多月时间就学会了一年才能学会的轧钢技术。青年团员于钦明等到太原钢厂轧钢车间学习的时候，正是炎热的夏天。轧钢车间工人都工作半小时休息半小时，可是于钦明等人利用休息时间学习拉铁、轧钢后面手、前面手和把闸的技术。轧钢机下边油泥满了，他们就跳到沟里往外掏油泥，自己完全变成了泥人。太原钢厂轧钢车间老工人们看到北京来的小伙子这样刻苦地学习，感动地写了一张
  “真不亏是毛主席身边的工人”的大字报，表示要用最短的时间教会他们的决心。在太原钢厂老工人热情的帮助下，他们已经能够熟练地轧钢了。
    8月17日，大红门轧钢厂的第一片矽钢片轧制出来了，车间立刻沸腾起来，工人们和领导干部互相祝贺。不久，方钢、圆钢、扁钢、螺纹钢等也生产出来了。可是拼凑起来的轧钢机，性能很难掌握，轧辊常坏，钢材产量也不高。卞心福同技术员张乃良又第二次出征，到六个地区二十一个工厂学习轧钢技术和先进经验，结果找到了轧辊坏的原因。他们回厂以后，立刻发动群众开展技术革命，安好了道轨和滑车，作了反围盘和切头机等，使体力劳动大大减轻，钢材产量也提高了。（附图片）
