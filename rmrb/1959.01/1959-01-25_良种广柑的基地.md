    Base for Fine Varieties of Guanggan Oranges
    By our reporter Sun Yuedong
    Not far outside the west gate of Jiangjin County seat is a lush orchard. The green branches are laden with golden Guanggan oranges, attracting passing pedestrians. Surrounding the orchard are rows of nurseries, with fruit saplings of varying heights, like children around their mother. Some are tender green shoots, some have just been grafted, while others are already gracefully awaiting transplanting. This is the supply base for fine Guanggan orange saplings – the Jiangjin Horticultural Experiment Station of Sichuan Province. Here, you can taste dozens of different fine Guanggan varieties, the most famous of which is the Goose Egg Orange. The fine fruit saplings cultivated here have been supplied to more than a dozen provinces in China, and their traces can even be seen in fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia. In the past five or six years, 500,000 fine saplings have been promoted to various places, the vast majority of which are Goose Egg Oranges. This experiment station covers an area of approximately 1,200 mu, with 40 to 50 technicians and more than 200 workers. Here, people are selecting, analyzing, and identifying various famous Jiangjin Guanggan oranges, breeding and cultivating a large number of excellent seedlings, researching fruit tree management techniques, and experimenting with how to eliminate the phenomenon of alternate-year fruit bearing in fruit trees, in order to achieve high and abundant yields every year.
    From the name Guanggan, which is commonly used by the people, it can be known that this fruit was not originally native to Sichuan. It is said that it was introduced to the Qijiang River area of Jiangjin County from Guangdong about 300 years ago. Under the diligent cultivation of local farmers, Guanggan trees have grown and propagated in the purple soil of Jiangjin and surrounding areas. Year after year, many excellent varieties have been cultivated by fruit farmers. Since 1953, the experiment station has organized working groups to investigate and study different varieties of Guanggan in the local area, and after selection, analysis, and identification, they are then systematically cultivated and promoted. Up to now, more than 20 excellent varieties have been selected, and more than 10 fine varieties have been introduced from other places. This place has almost become a general collection of fine Guanggan orange saplings. Through variety selection and identification, an interesting experiment is also being carried out here: among the selected varieties, some are early-maturing, such as the Tongzi Orange, Bingchun Orange, and Thin-skinned Fine-leaf Orange. When their skin color is still green, the pulp is already fragrant and sweet, and they can be harvested two months earlier than general mid-season varieties. However, some late-maturing varieties are delayed until early March of the following year to ripen, when there are not many fresh Guanggan oranges on the market. If early, mid-season, and late-maturing varieties of Guanggan oranges are cultivated and promoted in a planned way, the supply period of fresh Guanggan oranges can be extended by four or five months.
    This year, people's communes in various places are developing fruit trees in a planned way, and the demand for saplings has greatly increased. Although the experiment station has prepared 500,000 saplings, which is equivalent to the total number of saplings promoted in the past six years, it is still far from meeting the needs of various places. In the past, the time for Guanggan orange saplings to leave the nursery was slow, and three years of seedling cultivation became a matter of course. After the Great Leap Forward last year, the experiment station finally successfully experimented with a rapid seedling cultivation method: one is a two-year rapid seedling cultivation method, that is, seedlings are cultivated in the first year, fine varieties are grafted in the spring of the second year, and they can be taken out of the nursery for transplantation in the second half of the year. There is also another method, where fruit saplings can be taken out of the nursery in one year. The method is to use greenhouses to cultivate seedlings at the beginning of the year, graft in the summer, and then take them out of the nursery for transplantation in the winter of the same year. The success of the rapid seedling cultivation experiment has created favorable conditions for the rapid development of fine Guanggan orange varieties.

    良种广柑的基地
    本报记者　孙跃冬
    出江津县城西门不远，就是一片茂盛的果园，青绿的树枝上，结满了金黄色的广柑，吸引着来往的行人。果园的四周，是一畦畦的苗圃，高高低低的果树苗，像围绕在母亲身边的一群儿女。它们有的还是嫩绿的苗芽，有的才经过嫁接，而有的却已亭亭玉立等待出圃了。这里就是良种广柑树苗的供应基地——四川省江津园艺试验站。在这里，你能尝到数十种不同的良种广柑，其中最著名的一种就是鹅蛋柑。从这里培育出来的良种果树苗，曾供应国内的十几个省，甚至在苏、保、捷等兄弟国家，也能看到它们的踪迹。在最近五、六年中，推广到各地的良种树苗达五十万株，绝大多数都是鹅蛋柑。这个试验场的面积约一千二百亩，有四、五十名技术人员，两百多名工人。在这里，人们对各种各样的著名江津广柑进行着选择、分析和鉴定，繁殖培育大批优良种苗，研究果树的经营管理技术，试验着怎样消除果树隔年结果的现象，而达到年年高产多收。
    从广柑这个群众沿用的名称就可以知道，这种水果并非四川本地所原有，相传它大约是在三百多年前从广东引进到江津县綦江河一带来的。在当地农民辛勤地培植下，广柑树在江津及附近地区紫色土壤里生长并繁殖推广起来。一年又一年，许多优良的品种被果农们培育出来。试验站从1953年便组织了工作组，对当地不同品种的广柑进行调查研究，经过选择、分析、鉴定之后，再有计划的培育推广。到现在，选出的优良品种有二十多种，另外还有从外地引进的良种十多种，这里差不多成了良种广柑树苗的总汇。通过品种选择鉴定，这里还在进行一项有趣的试验：选育的品种中，有几种是早熟的，如桐子柑、冰纯柑、薄皮细叶柑等，当它们皮色还发青时，果肉却已香甜可食了，比一般中熟品种可提前两个月采摘。而另外有些晚熟品种却要延迟到次年3月上旬才成熟，那时，市场上新鲜的广柑已不多见了。如果将早、中、晚三种品种的广柑有计划地培育推广，新鲜广柑的供应期间前后可延长四、五个月。
    今年，各地人民公社都在有计划地发展果树，果苗的需要量大增。虽然试验站已准备了五十万株树苗，相当过去六年推广树苗的总数目，但仍远远不能满足各地的要求。过去广柑树苗出圃时间是较慢的，三年育苗成为天经地义的事。经过去年的大跃进，试验站终于试验成功了快速育苗法：一种是二年速成育苗法，即第一年育苗，第二年春天进行良种嫁接，下半年即可出圃移栽。还有另一种，果苗一年即可出圃。办法是年初用温室育成苗，夏天嫁接，当年冬季便可出圃移栽。快速育苗试验的成功，就给良种广柑的迅速发展创造了有利条件。
