Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 15th: Chervenkov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, who recently visited China, published an article entitled "The People's Communes of China" in "Rabotnichesko Delo" on the 15th, detailing the nature, organizational structure, and great superiority of the Chinese People's Communes in developing production and improving the lives of farmers.

The article stated that the new phenomenon of the Chinese People's Communes is a natural product of the nationwide movement to more broadly develop agricultural productive forces in China last year, the rectification campaign, and the Great Leap Forward in the economy.

The article pointed out that as soon as the communes appeared, they demonstrated their extraordinary vitality. In the short period since the establishment of the communes, the peasants have already realized their undeniable superiority and benefits in increasing production and improving the welfare of the peasants. The communes have significantly improved the lives of the peasants and have demonstrated a bright and realistic prospect for continuously improving the lives of the peasants in the future. It is particularly significant that Chinese women have been liberated from heavy housework for the first time.

When discussing the significance of the People's Communes, the article pointed out that, in reality, the communes already contain the seeds of communist distribution according to need (free supply of some items). The People's Communes simultaneously lead industry and agriculture, which opens the way to narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor. The article concluded by saying that the Great Leap Forward in China's production, construction, and culture is closely related to the People's Communes. This proves that the Chinese Communist Party, skillfully applying the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, has found the correct path for carrying out socialist construction in China and, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, is leading the Chinese people from victory to victory.

    契尔文科夫著文指出
    中国人民公社显示巨大优越性
    新华社索非亚15日电　不久前曾到中国访问的保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席契尔文科夫15日在“工人事业报”上以“中国的人民公社”为题发表文章，详细地介绍了中国人民公社的性质、组织机构和它在发展生产和改善农民生活方面显示出的巨大的优越性。
    文章说，中国的人民公社这一新现象是中国在去年更加广泛地发展农业生产力的全民运动，整风和经济大跃进的自然产物。
    文章指出，公社一出现，就显示了它的异乎寻常的生命力。在公社成立以后这一短短期间内，农民们已经体会到了它在增加生产和提高农民福利方面所带来的无容置疑的优越性和好处。公社显著地改善了农民的生活，并展示出将来不断改善农民生活的光明而现实的前景。而中国妇女第一次由繁重的家务劳动中解放出来这一情况尤其具有特殊意义。
    文章在谈到人民公社的意义时指出，实际上，公社已包含有共产主义按需分配的萌芽（免费供给部分）。人民公社同时领导工业和农业，这为缩小城乡差别、工农差别以及脑力劳动和体力劳动差别开辟了道路。文章最后说，中国在生产、建设和文化方面的大跃进与人民公社有着密切的联系。这证明，巧妙地运用了马克思列宁主义学说的中国共产党找到了在中国进行社会主义建设的正确的道路，并且在苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助下，正领导着中国人民从胜利走向胜利。
