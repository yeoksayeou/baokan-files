    Early Spring
    Yu Chuan
    The first snow had just fallen on the Chengdu Plain, and the north wind howled and tumbled on the construction site. People's enthusiasm melted this frozen world, and the project was advancing at a miraculous speed. After checking the quality of the three boiler steel frames that had just been hoisted last night, I was ready to get off work.
    "Have breakfast and go to the cadre section," the section chief gently pulled me, then walked away without even turning his head. I sensed that the thing that had been rumored lately was about to happen. However, I thought again: at this critical moment of the project, technical strength is needed. Could they really transfer me away?
    When I arrived at the cadre section, Section Chief Wang breathed a sigh of relief when he saw me walk in. "Oh, you're finally here!" I said in confusion, "The section chief only told me this morning, and I came as soon as I received the notice." Section Chief Wang smiled, "Your transfer order arrived last month, but your section wouldn't let you go. The Party Committee Secretary of the office severely urged your section chief, and only today did they release you. Your section chief is really parochial!"
    "What, are you really going to transfer me away?" I panicked upon hearing this and quickly said, "Section Chief Wang, you know that the project has just entered a tense stage. There are still two gas furnaces and two acid-resistant towers waiting to be constructed. The foreman has gone out to get materials, and I am the only one left at home. Besides, I must wait until everything is completed before I can leave!"
    Section Chief Wang pulled me to sit beside him and said patiently, "My opinion is the same as yours. But after all, we can't just look at the problem from one work section! If we look at the whole installation bureau, the whole of Sichuan, you and I will give up this idea." Seeing that I didn't respond, he continued, "The new construction site needs people very much. This year will be a bigger leap forward year. Where will the people come from? Shouldn't we be supported by these old construction sites? From our own perspective, the personnel seem a bit tight, but from the perspective of the whole of Sichuan, we are considered strong here."
    I couldn't find any reason to answer for a moment, so I just said, "In any case, other construction sites are not so tense, right!"
    Section Chief Wang said meaningfully, "Maybe that's the case. But we should completely change the phenomenon of 'slack in the front and tight in the back' in installation projects, don't you think? The purpose of transferring you now is to prepare early and strive to start fighting in January!"
    Then, regardless of whether my thoughts were clear or not, he introduced me in detail to the place I was going, the nature of the project, and the personnel situation. Finally, he added, "You go one step ahead, and we will follow later!"
    In this case, what else could I say?
    A few days later, a group of dozens of us got off the train at Zigong Station. The new environment was attracting us, and I had long forgotten the argument with Section Chief Wang.
    The new construction site was not far from the station, right on the quiet banks of the Fuxi River. On the way to the construction site, the slogans on the walls deeply touched our hearts: "Fight hard for three years and turn Zigong into a chemical city!"
    The construction site was in full swing. The sound of blasting mountains, workers' chants, and the roar of trucks loaded with construction equipment merged into a magnificent piece of music.
    Seeing such a lively scene, someone who is used to living on construction sites could no longer resist. That afternoon, we ran to the Chemical Industry Bureau and took back the installation drawings of the soda ash plant. The director of the bureau received us and welcomed our support on behalf of all the city's workers. Before leaving, he enthusiastically said to us, "The position of alkali in the chemical industry is just like the position of steel in the mechanical industry. We demand that it be officially put into production in June this year. This is also the hope of all the people in our city for you installation workers!"
    We took the drawings and rushed to the construction site, ready to immediately join the battle.
    Spring on the banks of the Fuxi River seemed to come earlier than any other year. What a wonderful spring it is again!

    早春
    于川
    川西平原上刚飘过第一场雪，北风呼呼的在工地上直打滚。人们的热情融化了这冰封的世界，工程正以神奇的速度向前推进。我检查了昨晚刚吊装的三台锅炉钢架的质量，就准备下班了。
    “吃了早饭到干部科去一下”，段长轻轻的拉了我一下，说完，连头也不回的就走开了。我预感到近来传说着的那件事将发生了。不过，我又转念想：在这工程的紧要关头，正需要技术力量，难道真会把我抽调走吗？
    到了干部科，王科长一见我走进门，就大大地舒了口气说：“唉呀，你到底来了！”我困惑地说：“今早晨段长才对我说，接到通知我就来了。”王科长笑笑：“你的调令上个月就到了，可是，你们段里不放你走。处党委书记狠狠的追了你们段长，直到今天才放了你，你们段长真本位啊！”
    “什么，真的要把我调走？”我一听急了，连忙抢着说：“王科长呀，你们不是不知道，工程刚刚进入紧张阶段，还有两台煤气炉，两台耐酸塔正待施工，工长到外面搞材料去了，家里只剩我一个人了。再说，无论如何要等全部竣工后才能脱手啊！”
    王科长拉我坐在他身边，耐心地说：“我的意见跟你一样。但是我们毕竟不能只从一个工段来看问题啊！如果从全安装局、全四川来看，你和我就都会放弃这种意见了。”他见我不响，又接下去说：“新的工地很需要人，今年将是更大的跃进年，人从哪里来呢？难道不应该由我们这些老工地来支援吗？从我们本身考虑，人员似乎紧了点，但是从全四川来看，咱们这里算强的呢。”
    我一下子找不出什么理由来回答，只好说：“无论怎样，其它工地总没有这样紧张吧！”
    王科长意味深长地说：“也许是这样。但是，我们应该彻底改变安装工程的前松后紧现象，你说不是吗？现在调你去的目的，也就在于早早做好准备，争取在1月份就开始战斗！”
    接着，他也不管我的思想通没通，就详细地向我介绍了要去的地方，工程的性质和人员情况，最后并添加一句：“你先走一步，我们随后跟来！”
    在这种情况下，我还能说什么呢？
    几天以后，我们一行几十个人在自贡车站下了车，新的环境在吸引着我们，我早把和王科长争辩的事情忘记了。
    新的工地离车站不远，就在这静静的釜溪河畔。在去工地的路上，壁上的标语深深的打动了我们的心弦：“苦战三年，把自贡变为化工城！”
    工地上正在紧张地施工，开山的炮响、工人的号子，以及满载着建设器材的汽车马达声，汇成了一支雄壮的乐曲。
    看到这样热闹的场面，对于一个在工地上生活惯了的人来说，早已耐不住了。当天下午，我们就跑到化工局拿回了纯碱厂的安装图纸。局长接见了我们，还代表全市职工欢迎我们的支援。临走时，他热情地跟我们说：“碱在化学工业上的地位，正如钢铁在机械工业上的地位，我们要求在今年6月正式投入生产，这也是我们全市人民对你们安装工作者的希望！”
    我们拿了图纸就赶到了工地，准备马上投入战斗。
    釜溪河畔的春天似乎比任何一年来得都早一些，这是多么好的又一个春天啊！
