    The principle of diligence and thrift will never be outdated
    Zhong Huai
    Everyone is increasingly aware of the importance of improving living standards. As for how to improve living standards, people still have different views and practices.
    Some people believe that to improve collective welfare, more grain and money should be used. In 1958, there was an unprecedented bumper harvest, and after the establishment of the communes, there was a large family and a large business, and there were also these material conditions. Therefore, public canteens can use grain without a plan, and setting up a nursery can cost hundreds of yuan. In the view of these comrades, the word "thrift" in diligence and thrift is somewhat outdated. To implement the principle of diligence and thrift will not improve living standards and shows a lack of a mass perspective.
    In fact, the principle of diligence and thrift will never be outdated. Diligence and thrift are closely related. Diligence means working hard, and thrift means correctly handling the fruits of labor. What kind of handling is considered correct? It is to appropriately combine immediate interests with long-term interests, and to make immediate interests subordinate to long-term interests. Thrift without diligence, of course, cannot fundamentally solve the problem of developing production and improving living standards; diligence without thrift cannot achieve the goal of continuing to develop production and improve living standards. Only with both diligence and thrift can we achieve "production is getting higher and higher, and life is getting better and better." The reason why agricultural production was able to make such a great leap forward in 1958 was also the result of both diligence and thrift. We will continue to leap forward this year, how can we not continue to implement the principle of diligence and thrift? With communization, it is indeed a "large family and a large business"; but if we do not pay attention to thrift, then things will also change—it will become a "large family and a small business."
    In fact, Chinese farmers have always had the tradition of diligence and thrift in managing their households. Many meaningful sayings are circulated among the people, such as "Eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, miscalculation makes you poor for life," "A small stream flows steadily," etc. These are all experiences accumulated over a long period of time. After the large-scale establishment of people's communes, the facts in many places also tell us that improving living standards is not contradictory to the principle of diligence and thrift. The public canteens of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan, originally used grain without a plan. Later, they strengthened management and established a system, which not only enabled the commune members to eat their fill and eat well, but also saved grain, and the commune members were generally satisfied. The No. 1 Brigade of the Ouqu Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu, set up three kindergartens without spending a penny.
    The key here is to follow the mass line. Taking the Hongguang Commune as an example, after the local party organization learned that the canteens had not implemented planned grain use and grain conservation, it conducted propaganda and education through various methods and launched mass debates. As a result, it established systems such as grain storage and canteen accounting, achieving eating one's fill, eating well, and saving, and the masses automatically rose up to check and prevent various phenomena of throwing away and wasting grain.
    The CPC Central Committee pointed out in its instructions on the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's Several Regulations on Doing a Good Job in the Current People's Life: "Life should be improved based on the spirit of diligence and thrift, rather than advocating extravagance and waste." This sentence embodies the demands of the broad masses. Only by doing things this way is it a complete mass viewpoint, not a one-sided mass viewpoint.

    勤俭原则永不过时
    锺怀
    对于搞好生活的重要性，大家越来越看得清楚了。至于怎样搞好生活，人们还有不同的看法和做法。
    有人认为要搞好集体生活福利，就得多用粮、多花钱。1958年空前大丰收，成立公社以后家大业大，也有这个物质条件。于是，公共食堂用粮可以不讲计划，办个托儿所可以花上几百块钱。在这些同志看来，勤俭的“俭”字有些过时了。要贯彻勤俭节约原则，就搞不好生活，就是缺乏群众观点。
    其实，勤俭原则永不过时。勤和俭有密切的关系。勤是要好好劳动，俭是要正确处理劳动的成果。怎样处理才算正确？就是要使眼前利益和长远利益适当结合，而且要使眼前利益服从长远利益。俭而不勤，固然不能从根本上解决发展生产、提高生活的问题；勤而不俭，也不能达到继续发展生产和提高生活的目的。又勤又俭，才能做到“生产越来越高、生活越过越好”。1958年农业生产所以能有这样大的跃进，也是又勤又俭的结果。我们今年还要继续跃进，不继续贯彻勤俭原则怎么行呢？公社化了，固然是“家大业大”；但是要是不注意节俭，那么事情也会发生变化——变成“家大业小”的。
    其实我国农民一向就有勤俭持家的传统。民间流传着许多意味深长的说法，像“吃不穷，穿不穷，计算不到一世穷”，“细水长流”等等，这都是长期积累起来的经验。大办人民公社以后，许多地方的事实也告诉我们，搞好生活同勤俭原则是不矛盾的。四川郫县红光人民公社的公共食堂原来用粮没有计划，后来加强了管理，建立了制度，不仅使社员吃得饱吃得好，而且节约了用粮，社员普遍满意。江苏常熟县藕渠公社一大队不花一文钱，就举办了三个幼儿园。
    这里的关键在于走群众路线。以红光公社为例，那里的党组织在了解到食堂没有实行计划用粮和节约用粮的问题后，就通过各种方式进行宣传教育，发动群众辩论，结果建立了粮食保管和食堂会计核算等制度，做到吃饱、吃好、节省，并且群众自动起来检查和防止各种抛撒浪费粮食的现象。
    中共中央在湖北省委关于做好当前人民生活的几项规定的批语中指出：“要根据勤俭节约的精神搞好生活，而不是提倡铺张浪费。”这句话体现了广大群众的要求。只有照这样办事，才是完全的群众观点，而不是片面的群众观点。
