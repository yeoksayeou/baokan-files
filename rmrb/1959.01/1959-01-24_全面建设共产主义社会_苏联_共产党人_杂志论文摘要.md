Comprehensive Construction of Communist Society
Abstracts from Articles in the Soviet Journal "Kommunist"

    Regularly Improve the Distribution System
    Reduce Differences in People's Living Standards

    The "Kommunist" magazine, issue number sixteen of 1958, published an article by M.S. Mstislavsky, Deputy Doctor of Economics, entitled "On the Road to Communist Living Standards," elaborating on the Soviet Seven-Year Plan.

    The author writes: By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the needs of residents will be fully met in terms of sugar, vegetables, dairy products, and vegetable oil. Fundamentally improving living conditions occupies a primary position in communist construction. In the next seven years, approximately two-fifths of the population will move into new homes. The construction of new houses will take into account giving each family a separate residence. Great attention will be given to convenient design and complete equipment of houses. At the same time, along with residential construction, public facilities will be developed, cities, workers' towns, and villages will be gasified, water pipes will be laid, and the bathing and laundry industries, urban transportation, etc., will be developed. Undoubtedly, people's consumption and needs will increase in the next seven years, both in quantity and especially in quality. At the same time, the science of studying rational consumption should be developed. This science should not only study the new consumption of the people, but also become the foundation for cultivating communist cultural preferences, and become a weapon for fighting against unreasonable habits, especially against the habits of excessive drinking, and vulgar tastes in clothing and living environment.

    The author says that significant changes will occur in the socialist distribution system, which is necessary according to the laws of preparing for the transition to the communist distribution system.

    In socialism, the distribution of consumer goods is limited by the level of production, and the differences in labor remuneration have not been completely eliminated. Only when the level of development of productive forces is higher than socialism, when materials are extremely abundant, can society turn to the implementation of the communist distribution principle. The communist distribution system can completely eliminate the shortcomings of the socialist distribution system. Preparing for the transition to the communist distribution principle requires not only the vigorous development of productive forces, but also the communist education of the people.

    Regularly improving the socialist distribution system is also an important prerequisite. Gradually bringing the living standards of various social members closer, gradually raising the wages of low-wage and middle-wage workers to the level of high wages, gradually reducing the difference in income between those with and without labor power, reducing the difference in income between families with different numbers of non-working members, and bringing the living standards of urban and rural areas closer are one of the main lines for developing the distribution of material and cultural living materials in the period of comprehensive development of communist construction.

    When explaining the process of eliminating the boundaries of living standards between various classes and types of working people and bringing such living standards closer, an important factor should also be taken into account. The number of Soviet workers and intellectuals and their proportion in the total population are rapidly increasing. At the same time, more and more workers and staff members live in local rural areas, many of whom are members of collective farmers' families. According to control figures, in the next seven years, the number of workers and staff members in the national economy will increase by 11.5 million, or 21%. The number of farmers will decrease slightly. Increasing the proportion of the working class and intellectuals will not only rely on the increase in the number of workers and staff members' families, but also on the increase in the number of workers and staff members in collective farmers' families. All of this will further improve the welfare of the people and further even out the living conditions of various types of residents. Reforming national education is also one of the factors in leveling living standards. Now, some families have more young people studying, and their income per family member is less than that of families with fewer students. Putting the younger generation into production will reduce this difference to a considerable extent. In the future, the state will increase assistance to families with many children. We believe that the most appropriate way to help such families is to provide free meals and uniforms to all students in schools.

    The author points out that constantly increasing the role and proportion of socialized and organized people's consumption is one of the important laws for the transition to the communist distribution system and to communist living standards. This people's consumption includes: public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and educating children in boarding schools, public nursing homes and homes for the disabled, public utility economy (room equipment, laundry, urban and rural public facilities), public sanatoriums, convalescent homes, and summer camps, public medical facilities, etc. It is appropriate to increase the development speed of organized social people's consumption to the extent that the need for small family economic development decreases. It is scheduled to build more than 22 million houses and buildings in urban and rural areas from 1959 to 1965. This means that 22 million kitchens, accounting for more than a quarter of the total residential area, will be built. The state will invest approximately 70 billion rubles in these kitchens. If you add the necessary dishes and utensils in the kitchen, the residents will spend even more on this.

    Of course, every family should have a good, modernly equipped household stove. However, with the proper development of public canteens, child-rearing institutions, and comprehensive life service institutions, the main expenses necessary for small family economics can be significantly reduced. In small families, the area of the kitchen can be reduced. If the food in the canteen is delicious and cheap, and it is close by, then some families and single men will be happy to not eat at home at all. Calculations show that if only the construction and equipment costs of small family kitchens are reduced by a quarter, then the amount of public canteens can be increased several times with this expense. Millions of housewives can free up time to participate in public economy, social activities and cultural life.

    The author believes that in the next seven years, public canteens should be transformed into a powerful socialist economic sector, which should be equipped with the latest technology, have highly skilled cadres, and be able to provide most residents with more delicious, nutritious, and cheaper breakfasts, lunches, and dinners than those made at home. This also needs to be taken into account in residential construction, the development of commercial networks, and rural construction. It is also necessary to build new types of communist-style houses according to the degree of material capacity growth. These communist-style houses should take into account a life service joint enterprise for every 100 to 200 households, including canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, boarding schools, children's clubs, adult reading rooms, and TV rooms. In every large residential area, it is also necessary to design a factory for manufacturing semi-finished foods, mechanized laundries, and complete sets of sports equipment, etc.

    Timely Discovery of Contradictions and Resolution of Contradictions
    Guarantee Room for Further Development of Productive Forces

    Issue number eighteen of the Soviet "Kommunist" magazine, published in December 1958, published an article by Dr. of Philosophy Glezerman, entitled "Changes in Social Relations During the Period of Large-Scale Construction of Communism."

    The article says: In the process of transitioning from socialism to communism, the vigorous development of productive forces requires that production relations, economic relations, and forms of economic management must be changed. The view that non-dialectically understands the nature of the adaptation of production relations to productive forces has long occupied a dominant position in our country's economics and philosophy works. Now, this view has been overturned not only in theory, but also in practice. Life proves that at a certain stage of development, productive forces cannot but conflict with the outdated aspects of production relations and the organizational forms of production and economic management. Timely discovery of these contradictions, correct adoption of the necessary measures to resolve these contradictions, and practical implementation of these measures can guarantee room for further development of productive forces. The Soviet people have already begun to taste the fruits of the reform of the industrial and construction industry management system implemented last year.

    When discussing the issue of gradually eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and the differences between workers and peasants, the article says: The basis for eliminating the remaining differences between the working class and collective farmers is to overcome the differences between the two forms of socialist ownership. The basis for solving this problem is the development of the socialist mode of production and the strong upsurge of productive forces in urban and rural areas. This upsurge of productive forces will gradually eliminate the boundaries between the two forms of ownership and eliminate the essential differences between urban and rural areas.

    When discussing the issue of collective farms having to comprehensively develop their economies in order to gradually transition to ownership by the whole people, the article says: The reorganization of machine tractor stations and the sale of machines to collective farms have solved the contradiction between the needs of collective farms in terms of mechanization and the forms of production technology services through machine tractor stations.

    Due to the reorganization of machine tractor stations, the procurement of agricultural products must adopt new methods, and commodity relations between urban and rural areas are also expanding day by day. This not only does not contradict further advancement towards communism, but creates conditions for more rapid advancement.

    In the process of collective farm ownership approaching ownership by the whole people, developing production connections between collective farms is of great significance. This is a new progressive phenomenon in the development of collective farm ownership. It proves that the increasing socialization of labor has begun to exceed individual, even huge, collective farms. Developing connections between collective farms can raise socialist collective farm ownership to a higher level of socialization. Industrial, construction, and other enterprises jointly organized by collective farms, enterprises for processing and storing agricultural products, as well as jointly organized power stations, irrigation and drainage projects, etc., will have an increasingly wider scale.

    When discussing the issue of eliminating the differences between physical and mental labor, the article mentions that communism will abolish the old forms of social division of labor formed over thousands of years in development. The article also criticizes the erroneous view that physical labor will be eliminated in communist society. The article says: In the process of advancing towards communism, based on comprehensive technological progress, the nature of labor has also changed. However, it must be pointed out that this process of changing the nature of labor is often depicted in a simplified way in our country. Some propagandists (equivalent to our country's theoretical teachers - editor's note) describe communist society as a society without physical labor at all when lecturing. This gives some listeners a caricatured concept of people in communist society: big head and small hands. What is even more harmful is that it sometimes creates a snobbish attitude of contempt for physical labor in schools, regarding physical labor as an industry historically destined to disappear and therefore incompatible with educated people. Obviously, with the progress of technology, physical labor itself must also change its content. Communism will not eliminate physical labor, but change it, making it combined with mental labor.

    Strengthen Communist Education
    Overcome Negative Factors in Active Life

    Issue number seventeen of the Soviet "Kommunist" magazine, published in December 1958, published an article entitled "Problems of Communist Construction and Ideological Education Work."

    The article says that life has placed new and higher demands on ideological education work. A task that is sharper than ever is to educate Soviet people in the spirit of communist consciousness, that is, in the spirit of true human morality, attract a wider range of workers to master the great cultural achievements, and clear away all negative phenomena left over from the old world of exploiters from daily life. Our ideology should more actively oppose the remnants of private ownership society, such as individualism, parasitism, idleness, hooliganism, and other behaviors that violate the laws and moral standards of communist society. The article points out that the ideological front has great significance for educating the growing generation. Soviet youth are steadfastly loyal to communist ideas and have demonstrated the power of this loyalty in practice. However, the struggle to eliminate the remnants of private ownership morality is still of primary significance. The dark side of life and the indecent behavior of some (of course, not many) young people should not be concealed by the achievements made in communist education for the younger generation. Among these people, you can find people with empty hearts, who are proud of their idleness and think that their mission is only to enjoy all the benefits of life, and not to add a brick to the communist mansion that the people are building. The article points out that the Soviet "Party's wise construction on strengthening the connection between schools and life and improving the national education system" plays an inestimable role in the correct intellectual and physical aspects of the growing generation, enabling us to overcome the negative factors in the multifaceted active life of our youth.

    The article requires economists and philosophers to focus on new phenomena in the mode of production and the foundation of socialist society. For example, more attention must be paid to analyzing the contradictions in the productive force system of socialist society in order to reveal the laws of forming the material and technical foundation of communism. For example, the role of material incentives in improving labor productivity, strengthening economic accounting, adjusting wages, the application of the law of value under Soviet social conditions, improving the statistics and labor remuneration system in collective farms, the national form of socialist ownership and the cooperative collective farm form and the ways for their further approach. The study of these issues is also of great significance.

    全面建设共产主义社会
    苏联“共产党人”杂志论文摘要
    经常改进分配制度
    缩小人们生活水平方面的差别
    1958年11月出版的“共产党人”杂志第十六期刊载了经济学副博士姆斯米斯拉夫斯基为阐述苏联七年计划而作的“在走向共产主义生活水平的道路上”的文章。
    作者写道：到七年计划底在糖、蔬菜、乳制品、植物油方面将完全满足居民的需要。根本改善居住条件在共产主义建设中占有头等地位。在今后七年中将有大约五分之二的居民迁入新居。新房屋的建造将考虑到：给每一家一套单独的住宅。对房屋的设计方便和设备完善将给予很大注意。同时，同住宅建筑一起，发展公共设施，城市、工人镇和乡村煤气化，敷设水管，发展洗澡洗衣业、城市交通等等。无疑，人的消费和需求在最近七年内在数量方面特别是质量方面都将会增长。与此同时应该发展研究合理消费的科学，这门科学要不仅研究人民的新的消费，并且成为培养符合共产主义文化的嗜好的基础，成为同不合理的习惯，特别是同过分饮酒的习惯、穿衣和生活环境方面的庸俗趣味作斗争的武器。
    作者说，在社会主义分配制度方面将发生重大的变化，这种变化是准备向共产主义分配制过渡在规律上所必要的。
    在社会主义中，消费品的分配为生产水平所限制，劳动报酬上的差别还没有完全消灭。只有当生产力的发展水平比社会主义更高的基础上，那时候物资极为丰富，社会才能够转而实现共产主义的分配原则。共产主义的分配制度能完全消除社会主义分配制度的缺陷。准备过渡到共产主义的分配原则，不仅需要生产力的蓬勃发展，同时也要对人民进行共产主义教育。
    经常改进社会主义的分配制度也是一个重要的前提。使各类社会成员的生活水平逐渐接近，逐步把低工资和中等工资的工作人员提高到高工资的水平，逐步缩小有劳动力和无劳动力的人收入的差别，缩小无劳动力的成员数目不同的家庭之间收入的差别，使城乡的生活水平接近，这是全面展开共产主义建设的时期中发展物质文化生活资料分配的主要路线之一。
    在说明消除各个阶级和各类劳动人民生活水平界限和使这种生活水平接近的过程时，还应该考虑到一个重要的因素。苏联工人和知识分子的数量以及他们在居民总数中的比重正在迅速增加。同时有越来越多的工人和职员住在当地农村中，其中许多人是集体农民的家属。根据控制数字，在今后七年内，国民经济中工人和职员的人数将增加一千一百五十万，也就是增加21％。农民的数量将略略减少。增加工人阶级和知识分子的比重将不仅依靠工人和职员家庭数的增加，同时也要依靠增加集体农民家庭中工人和职员的数量，所有这一些都会更加提高人民的福利，更进一步拉平各类居民的生活条件。改革国民教育也是拉平生活水平的因素之一。现在，有的家庭中有较多的求学青年，按照每一个家庭成员计算，他们的收入就比求学人数少的家庭的收入少。使年轻一代投入生产将在相当程度上减少这种差别。今后国家将增加对多子女家庭的帮助。我们认为，帮助这种家庭的最合适的方式就是在学校中免费供应全部学生的伙食和制服。
    作者指出，不断增加社会性有组织的人民消费的作用和比重是向共产主义分配制度和向共产主义生活水平过渡的重要规律之一，这种人民消费包括：公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和在寄宿学校中教育儿童，公营养老院和残废院，公用事业经济（房间设备，洗衣房，城乡公共设施），公营休养所、疗养院和夏令营，公共医疗设施等等。把有组织的社会性人民消费的发展速度提高到能使小家庭经济发展的需要下降的程度是合适的。预定1959年至1965年中城乡兴造二千二百多万幢住宅和房屋。这意味着，将建造占住宅总面积四分之一以上的厨房二千二百万个。国家对这些厨房将投资约七百亿卢布。如果加上厨房中所必要的碗碟和用具的话，居民花在这方面的费用还要大。
    当然，每个家庭应该有一个良好的、现代化设备的家用灶。可是在适当发展公共食堂、儿童教养机构和全面的生活服务机构的情况下，小家庭经济所必须的主要花费就可以显着减少。在小家庭中，厨房的面积可以缩小。如果食堂中的食物又好吃又便宜，而且离得近的话，那么一部分家庭和单身汉就会乐意完全不在家里吃饭。计算表明，如果仅仅把小家庭厨房的建筑和装备费减少四分之一，那么用这笔费用就可以把公共食堂的建筑量增加几倍。几百万的家庭主妇可以腾出时间来参加公共经济，参加社会活动和文化生活。
    作者认为今后七年内应该把公共食堂变为强大的社会主义经济部门，这个部门要装备有最新技术，有高度熟练的干部，并且能够给大部分居民供应比家庭做的更可口、更有营养和更便宜的早餐、午餐和晚餐。在住宅建筑、发展商业网和农村建设中也需要考虑到这一点。还应该根据物质能力增长的程度建造新型的、共产主义式的房屋，这种共产主义式的房屋要考虑到每一百至二百户有一个生活服务的联合企业，其中包括食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、寄宿学校、儿童俱乐部、成人阅览室和电视室等。在每一个大的住宅区还需要设计一个制造半成品食物的工厂、机械化洗衣房和成套的运动设备等等。
    及时发现矛盾解决矛盾
    保证生产力有进一步发展的余地
    1958年12月出版的苏联“共产党人”杂志第十八期发表了哲学博士格列则尔曼的一篇文章，题目是：“在大规模建设共产主义时期社会关系的变化”。
    文章说：在从社会主义向共产主义过渡的过程中，生产力的蓬勃发展，要求生产关系、经济关系及经济管理形式必须改变。非辩证地理解生产关系与生产力相适应的性质的看法，长期以来在我国的经济学与哲学的著作中占居统治地位。现在，不仅在理论上，而且在实践中推翻了这种看法。生活证明，生产力在一定发展阶段上，不能不同生产关系中已经过时的方面、生产与经济管理的组织形式发生矛盾。及时地发现这些矛盾，正确地采取解决这些矛盾所必需的措施，并实地予以执行，——这就可以保证生产力有进一步发展的余地。苏联人民已经开始尝到去年实行的工业与建筑业管理制度改组的果实。
    文章在谈到逐步消灭城乡差别和工农差别的问题时说：消灭仍然保留的工人阶级和集体农民差别问题，其基础则是克服社会主义所有制两个形式的差别问题。解决这一问题的基础是发展社会主义生产方式和城乡生产力的强大高涨。这一生产力的高涨会逐渐地消除两个所有制形式的界限，消除城乡的本质差别。
    文章在谈到集体农庄必须全面发展自己的经济以便逐步向全民所有制过渡的问题时说：改组机器拖拉机站、出售机器给集体农庄的作法，解决了集体农庄在机械化方面的需要同经由机器拖拉机站进行生产技术服务的形式不相适应的矛盾。
    由于机器拖拉机站的改组，农产品的采购就要采取新的办法，而且城乡间的商品关系也在日益扩大。这不仅和进一步向共产主义前进不矛盾，反而为更迅速的前进创造条件。
    在集体农庄所有制同全民所有制接近的过程中，发展各集体农庄间的生产联系具有重要意义。这是集体农庄所有制发展中的新的进步现象。它证明日益增长的劳动社会化，已经开始超出单个的、甚至巨大的集体农庄。发展集体农庄之间的联系，可以把社会主义集体农庄所有制提高到更高的社会化水平。各集体农庄共同举办的工业、建筑业及其他企业，农产品加工与贮存的企业，以及共同举办的发电站、灌溉与疏干工程等等，将具有越来越广泛的规模。
    文章在谈到消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动差别的问题时，提到共产主义在发展中将取消千百年来形成的社会分工的旧形式。文章并且批判了那种认为到了共产主义社会体力劳动就要消灭的错误说法。文章说：在向共产主义前进的过程中，在全面的技术进步的基础上，劳动的性质也起了变化。但是必须指出，改变劳动性质的这一过程在我国往往被描绘得简单化了。有一些宣传员（相当于我国的理论教员——编者注）在讲课时，把共产主义社会描绘成根本没有体力劳动的社会。这使某些听讲人对于共产主义社会的人产生了一个漫画式的概念：头大手小。更有害的是有时在学校里造成一种轻视体力劳动的老爷态度，把体力劳动看成是历史上注定消失的、因而同有教养的人不相称的行业。显然，随着技术的进步，体力劳动本身也要改变内容。共产主义不会消灭体力劳动，而是改变它，使它同脑力劳动结合起来。
    加强共产主义教育
    克服积极生活中的消极因素
    1958年12月出版的苏联“共产党人”杂志第十七期发表了一篇题为“共产主义建设和思想教育工作问题”的文章。
    文章说，生活向思想教育工作提出了新的更高的要求。一项比任何时候更加尖锐的任务就是：用共产主义觉悟的精神，即用真正人的道德的精神教育苏联人，吸引更加广泛的劳动者掌握伟大的文化成果，从日常生活中清除剥削者旧世界遗留下来的一切消极现象。我们的思想体系应该更积极地反对私有制社会的残余，如个人主义倾向，寄生行为、游手好闲、流氓行为和其他破坏共产主义社会法律和道德准则的行为。文章指出，思想战线对教育正在成长中的一代具有重大的意义。苏联青年坚定不移地忠于共产主义的思想，并且在实践中表明了这种忠诚的力量。但致力于消灭私有制道德残余的斗争还是具有首要的意义。不应当以对青年一代进行共产主义教育已取得的成就来掩盖生活的阴暗面，掩盖某些（当然是不多的）青年的不体面的行为。在这些人中可以碰到心灵空虚的人，他们反以自己的游手好闲为荣，认为自己的使命只在享受一切生活福利，而不对人民正在建设的共产主义大厦加一块砖。文章指出，苏联“党关于加强学校同生活的联系和改进国民教育制度的英明建设”对正在成长中的一代的正确的智育和体育方面起不可估量的作用，使我们能够克服我国青年多方面的积极生活中的消极因素。
    文章要求经济学家和哲学家集中注意生产方式中、社会主义社会基础中的新现象，例如，必须更多地注意分析社会主义社会生产力系统中的矛盾，以便揭示出形成共产主义物质技术基础的规律，再如，物质刺激在提高劳动生产率中的作用，加强经济核算，调整工资，在苏联社会条件下的价值法则的运用，改善集体农庄中的统计和劳动报酬制度，社会主义所有制的全民形式与合作社集体农庄形式和它们的进一步接近的途径，新条件下国民经济计划化的形式和方法。对这些问题的研究也具有重大意义。
