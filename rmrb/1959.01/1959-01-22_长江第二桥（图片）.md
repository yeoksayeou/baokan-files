The Second Yangtze River Bridge

    The construction of the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge is now in full swing. The entire bridge, including the cross-line bridge for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, has a total of nineteen piers. Fifteen of them are under intense construction. The workers are determined to complete all nine underwater piers during the dry season. The foundation construction method of this bridge is the "large-diameter caisson drilling method" jointly created by China and the Soviet Union during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

    长江第二桥
    重庆长江大桥现已在经进入全面施工阶段。全桥加上成渝铁路的跨线桥共十九个桥墩，有十五个正在紧张施工，工人们决心在枯水季节，把水中的九个桥墩全部修出水面。这座大桥的基础工程施工方法，是采用修建武汉长江大桥时中苏合作创造的“大型管柱钻孔法”。
