Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Beijing suburbs people's communes are launching a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement.

Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of the First Secretaries of suburban districts and county committees to arrange for the immediate launch of a large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign in the suburbs. The meeting pointed out that with the widespread implementation of close planting and deep plowing this year, only much more fertilizer than last year can guarantee sufficient topdressing and base fertilizer for winter crops and spring-sown crops, and ensure a greater agricultural harvest this year. Therefore, the meeting demanded that all communes, in conjunction with the Spring Festival's major sanitation cleanup, rapidly launch a vigorous fertilizer accumulation and production movement. In terms of fertilizer accumulation methods, in addition to consolidating and organizing professional fertilizer accumulation teams, the task of fertilizer accumulation should also be assigned to households and individuals, implementing quantitative, qualitative, time-bound, and reward-based measures for fertilizer accumulation. The meeting also pointed out that some institutions, schools, and factories with the conditions to accumulate fertilizer should also undertake fertilizer accumulation tasks, truly launching a mass movement in which everyone participates and every household accumulates fertilizer.

Shunyi, Huairou, Mentougou, and Zhoukoudian districts (counties) have decided to launch a ten-day to half-month concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign before the Spring Festival. Shunyi District requires a major effort for half a month, accumulating 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Zhoukoudian District aims to accumulate 25,000 jin of coarse fertilizer per mu of basic farmland and produce 100 to 200 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer in ten days. In the vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign in Pinggu County, efforts are made to combine professional teams with everyone's participation, combining farm household fertilizer accumulation with indigenous chemical fertilizer production, and emphasizing both quantity and quality. Tongzhou District, which has a large area sown to winter crops, aims to accumulate an additional 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu for the district's 400,000 mu of wheat fields before the Spring Festival, based on the existing 2.2 billion jin of fertilizer.

    结合春节扫除大积肥料
    北京开展群众性的突击运动
    据新华社讯　北京郊区人民公社正在开展一个大规模积肥运动。
    最近，中共北京市委召开了郊区区、县委第一书记会议，布置立即在郊区开展大规模的积肥运动。会议指出，在今年普遍实行密植和土地深翻的情况下，只有比去年多得多的肥料才能保证过冬作物和春播作物有足够的追肥和底肥，保证今年农业的更大丰收。因此，会议要求，各公社要结合春节卫生大扫除迅速开展起一个轰轰烈烈地积肥造肥运动。在积肥方法上，除了要整顿和组织好积肥专业队伍外，还要把积肥任务分配到户、到人，实行定量、定质、定时和定奖励的办法进行积肥。会议还指出，一些有条件积肥的机关、学校和工厂，也要担当积肥任务，真正掀起一个人人动手、户户积肥的群众性运动。
    顺义、怀柔、门头沟和周口店等区（县），已决定在春节前开展一次十天到半月的突击积肥运动。顺义区要求大干半月，每亩积肥三万斤。周口店区要在十天中为每亩基本农田积粗肥二万五千斤，制出土化肥一百至二百斤。平谷县在大搞积肥运动中，作到专业队与人人动手相结合，农家积肥与土制化肥相结合，数量和质量并重。冬季播种较多的通州区，要在现有二十二亿斤肥料的基础上，力争在春节前再为全区四十万亩麦田每亩积肥一万斤。
