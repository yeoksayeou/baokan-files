Xinhua News Agency, 28th: A scientific research team for desert control, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Desert Control Team, has been formed, jointly composed of more than 40 units including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, relevant central and local departments, and universities. The Desert Control Team consists of more than 800 scientific research personnel and administrative technicians from over ten disciplines including forestry, animal husbandry, agronomy, botany, water conservancy, hydrology, geology, and soil science. Soon, this scientific desert control team will head to various regions in Northwest China for investigation, including the Tarim Great Desert, which has never been deeply explored before, to ascertain the actual conditions of deserts nationwide. At the same time, they will establish six comprehensive experimental stations in various desert regions, combining with local scientific and technological forces to conduct research and experimentation focusing on planting grass and trees and building water conservancy projects. This is an important step in implementing the comprehensive desert control plan formulated at the six provinces and regions desert control planning conference held in Hohhot last winter.

From January 16th to 23rd, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Desert Control Team held a meeting in Beijing to plan this year's work, and proposed the focus of this year's scientific research: to study the vegetation conditions and patterns in the desert; to study planting trees and grass and aerial seeding in the desert; to study diverting water to irrigate the desert, developing underground water sources in the desert, and experimenting with artificial rainfall over the desert; to study the agricultural utilization of sandy land and the impact of desert greening on the climate; to study the application of solar energy, wind energy, and new technologies in desert transformation; and to study the formation of deserts and the laws of sand dune movement, and so on. These many research topics will lead to one result, namely, proposing specific measures for the comprehensive transformation and utilization of deserts.

    全面改造利用沙漠
    一支治理沙漠科学队伍组成
    新华社28日讯　由中国科学院、中央和地方有关部门以及高等学校等四十多个单位共同组成一支治理沙漠的科学研究队伍——中国科学院治沙队。治沙队有森林、畜牧、农学、植物、水利、水文、地质、土壤等十多个学科的科学研究人员和行政技术人员等共八百多人。不久以后，这支治沙科学队伍将分头到我国西北各个地区进行考察，包括从来没有人深入过的塔里木大沙漠，以便摸清全国沙漠的底细；同时，他们将要在各沙漠地区设立六个综合试验站，与地方科学技术力量结合进行以种草造林、兴修水利为中心的研究试验工作。这是实现去年冬天在呼和浩特举行的六省区治沙规划会议上所制订的，全面治沙规划方案的一个重要步骤。
    1月16日到23日，中国科学院治沙队在北京举行会议，规划今年的工作，提出了今年科学研究工作的重点：研究沙漠中的植被情况与规律，研究沙漠中植树种草和飞机播种；研究引水灌溉沙漠、开发沙漠中的地下水源，以及在沙漠上空试验人工降水，研究沙地的农业利用以及沙漠绿化后对气候的影响，研究太阳能、风能和新技术在改造沙漠中的应用，以及研究沙漠的形成和沙丘移动规律，等等。这许多研究课题将归结为一个结果，即提出全面改造利用沙漠的具体措施。
