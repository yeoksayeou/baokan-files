Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 11th: The result of Taiyuan City's "Ten Thousand Machines Movement"—more than 11,000 pieces (sets) of economical and practical mechanical equipment manufactured in the past two months have been successively put into production in the first ten days of this year, providing more favorable conditions for ensuring the completion of this year's first quarter mechanical and other production tasks.

The batch of mechanical products manufactured by the city through a concentrated effort includes metallurgical, mining, power, transportation equipment and machine tools. Among them, various indigenous and simple equipment account for about two-fifths; these simple equipment not only save materials and are easy to use, but some equipment has approached or exceeded the production capacity of foreign equipment.

After this batch of mechanical equipment was successively put into production, many machinery factories supplemented the large-scale equipment and special equipment lacking in the first quarter of this year's production, increasing new production capacity. Workers at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory used 310 sets of various mechanical equipment recently produced to further arm themselves and have already put them into production. The 350 initial rolling mill manufactured by Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory has been transported to the Taiyuan Wire Rod Factory and put into production. After the Taiyuan Vehicle Factory equipped itself with various indigenous and foreign mechanical equipment, not only did the factory's mechanical equipment increase by one and a half times compared with the original, but also the fitter, forging and other processes, which used to be manual operations, were fully or partially mechanized.

Taiyuan City's Ten Thousand Machines Equipment Manufacturing Movement began in November last year. At that time, many units urgently needed rolling steel, metallurgy, mining and other equipment. In view of this, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China quickly led and mobilized the masses of workers to launch a movement to manufacture ten thousand pieces of equipment to meet the needs of relevant units. As each factory repeatedly reviewed and balanced the mechanical manufacturing plan under the principle of ensuring the completion of national key tasks and supporting others, and adopted the method of indigenous methods first, and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the concentrated manufacturing movement quickly achieved a great harvest.

### 太原及早进行准备迎接跃进年  万台设备投入战斗

    太原及早进行准备迎接跃进年
    万台设备投入战斗
    新华社太原11日电　太原市开展“万台机械运动”的成果——最近两个月制造出一万一千多台（套）经济、适用的各种机械设备，已经在今年的头十天陆续投入生产，为保证完成今年第一季度的机械等生产任务提供了更有利的条件。
    全市突击制造的这批机械产品，包括冶金、采矿、动力、运输设备和机床等。其中各种土法简易设备约占五分之二；这些简易设备不仅节省材料、使用方便，而且有一些设备已接近或超过了洋设备的生产能力。
    这批机械设备陆续投入生产以后，许多机械工厂在今年第一季生产中缺少的大型设备和专用设备得到了补充，增加了新的生产能力。太原矿山机器厂职工，拿最近生产的各种机械设备三百一十台（套），进一步武装了自己，并且已经在生产中发挥了作用。太原重型机器厂制造的三五○初轧机，已经运往太原线材厂投入生产。太原车具厂生产的各种土洋机械设备装备了自己以后，不仅使全厂的机械设备比原来增加一倍半，而且使过去一向用手工操作的钳工、锻工等工序，全部或部分地实现了机械化。
    太原市万台机械设备制造运动是去年11月开始的。当时好多单位迫切需要轧钢、冶金、采矿等设备。中共太原市委有鉴于此，便迅速领导发动职工群众掀起了制造万台设备、满足有关单位需要的运动。由于各厂在保证完成国家重点任务和支援别人的原则下，反复地审查和平衡了机械制造计划，并且采取了土法上马、土洋结合的办法，因而使这次突击制造运动很快获得了大丰收。
