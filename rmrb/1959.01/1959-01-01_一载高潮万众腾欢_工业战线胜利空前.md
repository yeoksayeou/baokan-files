Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: In 1958, the Chinese people marched forward with great strides and high spirits on the industrial production front, achieving brilliant and splendid victories at a rate far exceeding any previous year. According to preliminary statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the total industrial output value in 1958 will reach approximately 120 billion yuan, a sharp increase of more than 60% compared to 1957, greatly exceeding the average annual industrial growth rate of 19.2% during the First Five-Year Plan. This high speed is unprecedented in the industrial development history of any capitalist country.

This year, major industrial products have seen significant growth. Steel reached approximately 11 million tons, and coal reached approximately 270 million tons, both more than doubling compared to 1957. In the machinery industry, machine tools reached more than 90,000 units, power generating equipment reached more than 1 million kilowatts, and metallurgical equipment reached 180,000 tons, representing an increase of more than two to thirteen times compared to 1957, exceeding or greatly exceeding the total output of these three products during the First Five-Year Plan. Electricity reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, and oil reached 2.25 million tons, representing increases of 42% and 54% respectively compared to 1957. With the rapid development of heavy industry, light industry has also seen significant growth, with cotton yarn reaching approximately 6.8 million bales and cotton cloth reaching 6.4 billion meters. Transportation, postal and telecommunications services have also seen great development.

The tens of thousands of new industrial products successfully trial-produced in 1958 present a flourishing scene of a hundred flowers blooming and vibrant colors. The vast number of workers have made more inventions and creations this year than ever before. Various industrial departments have made significant achievements in mastering cutting-edge technologies of great significance to the national economy. Through a year of rich practice, the technical strength of China's industry is growing rapidly.

The picture of national economic prosperity and vigor displayed by China and other socialist countries led by the Soviet Union this year stands in stark contrast to the severe economic crisis and sharp decline in production currently seen in the Western capitalist world. This fact once again eloquently demonstrates that the socialist system has great vitality and incomparable superiority.

The most fundamental reason for the great achievements in China's industrial production in 1958 is the earnest implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction. The Party's policy of "walking on two legs," that is, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small- and medium-sized enterprises, simultaneously using "foreign" methods and "indigenous" methods, and combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements, is a beacon illuminating the high-speed and rapid advance of China's industrial production. Since spring, especially after the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party in August, Party committees at all levels have shifted their focus from agriculture to industry, rapidly launching a mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to develop industry on a national scale. This is vividly reflected in the growth figures of several major products nationwide around August. Compared with the sum of the output in the first eight months of 1958, the sum of the output in the last four months of 1958 saw the national steel output increase by more than 40%, machine tool output increase by more than 30%, power generating equipment increase by more than double, and blast furnace equipment increase by about four times. The old conventions of relying on a few people to run industry in a cold and quiet manner have been thoroughly changed. While central enterprises and large-scale enterprises are increasing production and accelerating construction, all parts of the country have established thousands of steel, machinery, coal, chemical fertilizer, and other medium and small-scale industries in a short period of time, enabling many areas in China that were originally blank spots in industry or had very weak industrial foundations to rapidly develop industrial production from scratch, from small to large. A moving picture of "machines everywhere, factories all over the countryside" has begun to appear across the country. The ranks participating in industrial production and construction are not only tens of millions of workers, but also the broad masses of farmers, who have become an important force in developing industry.

The outstanding feature of the mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to develop industry in 1958 is that it takes the steel industry as the key, driving the overall leap forward of various industrial departments and other departments of the national economy. That is to say, in 1958, the Chinese people initially recognized and mastered the principle of taking steel as the key to drive everything else in China's industrial construction at the present stage, and explored a path for high-speed industrial development. In 1958, while the national steel output increased by more than double compared to 1957, the coal output directly related to steel production increased by more than double compared to 1957, and the main products of the machinery industry department increased by two to more than ten times compared to 1957; even many products of light industry also saw significant growth compared to 1957.

The great achievements on China's industrial front are also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. At present, the vast number of workers and masses on China's industrial front are continuing to forge ahead along the victorious road of 1958, striving for even greater and more brilliant achievements in the new year, based on the possible conditions of materials and technology, continuing to exert all their efforts, aiming high, and riding the waves.

    一载高潮万众腾欢
    工业战线胜利空前
    新华社31日讯　1958年，我国人民在工业生产战线上昂首阔步、高歌猛进，以远远超过以往任何一年的高速度，取得了辉煌灿烂的伟大胜利。据国家统计局初步统计，1958年工业总产值将达到一千二百亿元左右，比1957年猛增60％以上，大大超过了第一个五年计划期间平均每年工业增长19.2％的速度。这种高速度是任何资本主义国家工业发展史上所没有过的。
    这一年，主要工业产品都有很大的增长。钢达到一千一百万吨左右，煤二亿七千万吨左右，都比1957年翻了一番多。机械工业方面，机床达到九万多台、发电设备一百多万瓩、冶金设备十八万吨，比1957年增长两倍多到十三倍，超过或大大超过第一个五年计划期间这三种产品产量的总和。电力达到二百七十五亿度，石油二百二十五万吨，分别比1957年增长42％和54％。随着重工业的迅速发展，轻工业也有很大增长，棉纱达到六百八十万件左右，棉布六十四亿公尺。交通运输、邮电事业也有很大发展。
    1958年试制成功的、数以万计的工业新产品，更呈现出百花争艳、万紫千红的欣欣向荣景象。广大职工在这一年当中，发明创造之多，也是前所未有的。各个工业部门在掌握对国民经济具有重大意义的尖端技术方面，已取得了显著的成就，我国工业的技术力量，经过一年来丰富的实践，正在飞跃地成长。
    我国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，今年所表现出来的国民经济一片繁荣奋发的图景，同目前西方资本主义世界严重的经济危机、生产猛烈下降的凄惨景象，适成鲜明的对照。这个事实再一次雄辩地表明，社会主义制度具有伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。
    1958年我国工业生产获取的伟大成就，最根本的原因是认真贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线。党所规定的“用两条腿走路”的方针，即：在优先发展重工业的基础上工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，“洋”法生产和“土”法生产同时并举以及集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，是照耀着我国工业生产高速猛进的灯塔。自从春天以来，特别是8月党中央政治局扩大会议以后，各级党委把领导重心从农业转向工业，在全国范围内迅速掀起了一个全党全民大办工业的群众运动。这从8月份前后全国几种主要产品增长的数字里鲜明地表现出来。以1958年后四个月的产量总和和前八个月的总和相比，全国的钢产量增加了40％以上，机床产量增加了30％以上，发电设备增加了一倍多，高炉设备增加了四倍左右。历来依靠少数人办工业的冷冷清清的常规被彻底改变了。在中央企业、大型企业增加生产、加速建设的同时，全国各地在短期内建立起了成千上万座钢铁、机械、煤炭、化学肥料和其他中、小型工业，使我国许多原来工业上的空白点或工业基础十分薄弱的地区，工业生产快速地从无到有、从小到大地发展起来，全国开始出现了“机器到处响，工厂遍城乡”的动人图景。参加工业生产、建设的队伍，不仅仅是几千万工人，而广大农民，也成为新的发展工业的重要力量。
    1958年全党全民办工业的群众运动的突出特点，是以钢铁工业为纲，带动了各工业部门和国民经济其他部门全面跃进。这就是说，我国人民在1958年工业生产战线上初步认识和掌握了在目前时期我国工业建设必须采取以钢为纲带动一切的方针，摸索出了高速度发展工业的途径。1958年在全国钢产量比1957年增加了一倍挂零的同时，和钢铁生产直接相联系的煤产量，比1957年增加了一倍以上，机械工业部门的主要产品，比1957年增加了两倍到十数倍不等；就是轻工业的许多产品也比1957年有了很大增长。
    我国工业战线上的伟大成就也是和苏联和其他社会主义国家无私的援助分不开的。目前，我国工业战线上的广大职工和群众正沿着1958年胜利的道路，根据物质技术的可能条件，继续鼓足干劲、力争上游、乘风破浪地前进，争取在新的一年取得更伟大更辉煌的成就。（附图片）
