Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th dispatch: After being forced to express recognition of the new Cuban government, the United States continues to take in large numbers of high-ranking officials of the Batista dictatorial regime, who are hated by the Cuban people, allowing them to seek "refuge" in the United States.

According to United Press International, the U.S. Immigration Bureau admitted on the 8th that seven senior naval officers of the Cuban dictatorial government, including two generals, will formally receive U.S. entry permits. At the same time, the yacht carrying the notorious former Cuban Senator Rolando Masferrer has also been allowed to dock in the United States. This man is known for slaughtering the Cuban people. The "Tiger Squad" he led stubbornly resisted when the Cuban rebel army entered Havana, and was still carrying out disturbances in Havana on the evening of the 7th. Just one day before the U.S. Immigration Bureau announced that Masferrer's yacht was docking in the United States, Luis Buch, the secretary of the Cuban Provisional Government President, had already announced that the Cuban government had requested the U.S. government to extradite this "powerful figure" in the Batista government, and announced that he had instructed the Attorney General of the Supreme Court to immediately file a public prosecution against Masferrer.

According to American news agencies, on the eve of the collapse of the Cuban dictatorial government, a large number of officials of the dictatorial government fled by plane or yacht to Miami, New Orleans, and other places in the United States. These people immediately received temporary U.S. visas and are now scattered throughout the United States. The U.S. government not only allows these criminals of the Cuban people to stay in the United States, but also tries to prevent Cuban expatriates from demonstrating and protesting against these people.

    美国是政治垃圾收容所
    庇护大批古巴前独裁政权分子
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国在被迫表示承认古巴新政府以后，却继续大量收留为古巴人民所痛恨的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的高级官员，让他们在美国“避难”。
    据合众国际社报道，美国移民局在8日承认，有七名古巴独裁政府的海军高级军官、其中有两名是将军将正式得到美国的入境证。同时罪恶昭彰的前古巴参议员罗兰多·马斯费雷尔所乘的游艇也已经被允许在美国靠岸。这个人以屠杀古巴人民著称，他所领导的“老虎队”在古巴起义军进入哈瓦那时曾经负隅顽抗，并且在7日晚上仍然在哈瓦那进行骚动。就在美国移民局宣布马斯费雷尔所乘的游艇在美国靠岸的前一天，古巴临时政府总统秘书路易斯·布奇已经宣布古巴政府要求美国政府引渡这个巴蒂斯塔政府中的“有力人物”，并且宣布已经指示最高法院检察长立即对马斯费雷尔提起公诉。
    据美国通讯社报道，在古巴独裁政府垮台的前夕，独裁政府的大批官员乘飞机或游艇逃到美国的迈阿密和新奥尔良等地。这些人马上得到美国的临时签证，现在散布在美国各地。美国政府不但让这些古巴人民的罪犯留住在美国，而且还设法防止古巴侨民对这些人的示威和抗议。
