    Qing Chun Ze
    --Welcoming the New Year of 1959
    Deng Tuo

    China is flying, the world is watching, the east wind is blowing all over the world. The leadership is brilliant, and the future is infinitely happy. The people are loyal, brave, hardworking, and even more rare are their wisdom and talent. We have great ambitions to transform our hometown and build a paradise. The New Year coincides with the early spring, see the cotton and grain songs and dances, and the steel is soaring with joy. One year of high tide has turned the world upside down; after a few more rounds of hard struggle, we will surely turn the world upside down. Looking forward to the future, interstellar navigation and world peace.

    庆春泽
    ——迎接1959年元旦
    邓拓中国飞奔，全球注视，东风吹遍大千。领导英明，前途幸福无边。人民忠勇勤劳甚，更难能足智多贤。有雄心，改造家乡，建设乐园。新年又值春光早，看棉粮歌舞，钢铁腾欢。一载高潮，竟然倒海移山；再经苦战几回合，管教他地复天翻。盼将来，星际通航，世界长安。
