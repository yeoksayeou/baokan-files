　　Driver Wei Deling of a certain unit, seeing that all the comrades in the company had become multi-skilled chemical soldiers in a short period of time, wanted to learn more skills and add more strength to defeating the enemy.

　　One night, he told the leaders about this idea, saying, "No matter how difficult it is to learn, if you can learn it, I can definitely learn it too." The leaders saw that he had such great confidence and agreed.

　　In addition to completing his driver's professional studies and work, Wei Deling studied chemical warfare operations with a diligent and hardworking spirit every day. One night, everyone else was asleep, but he was still practicing the use of skin protection equipment. Some comrades asked him to go to sleep, but he said, "It's a Great Leap Forward! Practicing a little more, it doesn't matter if I go to sleep later." As the learning entered an intense phase, Wei Deling developed a sore on his middle finger that was so painful he couldn't sleep at night, but he still persisted in the operations during the day. Other car drivers were moved by his spirit and automatically participated in the study of chemical warfare operations. With the help of his comrades, Wei Deling fulfilled his wish in less than a month, learning to use various protective equipment, as well as all the operations of radiation reconnaissance (poison detection) soldiers, ground disinfection soldiers, and weapon disinfection soldiers. Not long ago, the military region organized a chemical warfare soldier competition, and Wei Deling achieved good results in the multi-skilled chemical warfare soldier test. Comrades proudly said: Wei Deling is not only our company's car soldier, but also our company's multi-skilled chemical warfare soldier.

    驾驶员成了多能防化兵
    某部汽车驾驶兵韦德灵，看到全连同志在短期内成了多能化学兵，就想多学一套本领，多增加一分打击敌人的力量。
    一天晚上，他把这个心思告诉了领导同志，他说：“不管多难学，你们能学会我一定也能学会。”领导看他信心这样大，也就答应了。
    韦德灵除了完成司机的业务学习和工作外，每天都以勤学苦练的精神学习防化操作。一天晚上，大伙都睡了，只有他还在练习皮肤防护器材的使用。有的同志叫他去睡，他说：“跃进嘛！多练一会，晚点睡也没什么关系。”学习进入紧张阶段，韦德灵的中指长了个疮，晚上痛得不能入眠，可是白天他同样坚持了操作。其他汽车驾驶员被他这种精神感动了，也自动参加防化业务学习。韦德灵在同志们的帮助下，不到一个月就实现了自己的心愿，学会了使用各种防护器材，以及辐射侦察（侦毒）兵、地面消毒兵和兵器消毒兵的各项操作。不久前，军区组织防化兵评比，韦德灵在多能防化兵测验中，获得了良好的成绩。同志们都自豪地说：韦德灵不但是我们连的汽车兵，而且是我们连的多能防化兵。
