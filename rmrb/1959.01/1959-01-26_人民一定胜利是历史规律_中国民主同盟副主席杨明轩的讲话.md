Dear compatriots:
    At this solemn demonstration today, I represent the China Democratic League in expressing our firm support for the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism, and express our boundless anger at the US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' bloody suppression of the Congolese people.
    Cuba is the Cuba of the Cuban people, and the Congo is the Congo of the Congolese people. The Cuban people have long been under the rule of US imperialism and its running dog Batista regime, suffering unbearable enslavement and exploitation. Armed uprisings have erupted repeatedly. After a long period of struggle, they finally completely overthrew the US imperialism-backed dictatorial regime on January 1 this year, established a provisional government, and achieved a complete victory. This victory dealt a heavy blow to US imperialism and gave tremendous encouragement to the Cuban people, the Latin American people, and the peace-loving people of the world. US imperialism is unwilling to accept defeat. It is still shamelessly clamoring, threatening, and plotting to obstruct the Cuban provisional government from punishing Batista's criminals. This measure of the Cuban provisional government is supported by all the Cuban people. It is entirely in line with the interests of the Cuban people. This is Cuba's internal affair, and no foreign country has the right to interfere.
    At the same time as the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle achieved brilliant victory, in the distant African continent, the cry of "Long live the independence of the Congo!" "Belgians, get back to Europe!" resounded across Africa. The Congolese people have lived for eighty years under the dark and inhuman rule of Belgian colonialism. The people have long been threatened by imprisonment, exile, disease, and death. The Congolese people deeply understand that they can only gain independence and freedom after breaking the shackles imposed on them by the colonialists. For more than a decade, the Congolese people have waged countless fierce struggles against the Belgian colonialists. The blood of patriotic martyrs has not been shed in vain. The people's uprising movement has grown and developed day by day. Today, the African national liberation movement has set off a new upsurge. The Congolese people have bravely stood up and launched a relentless struggle against the colonialists. The Belgian colonialists, like US imperialism, are unwilling to accept defeat. They have carried out frantic suppression and massacres of the Congolese people, but the Congolese people's flames of resistance, like a volcanic eruption, cannot be suppressed.
    All imperialists and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Ten years ago, all imperialists and reactionaries at home and abroad in China suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Chinese people. This has been confirmed by history. Today, in Latin America, Cuba has once again confirmed this, and in Africa, the Congo will also confirm this. This is the law of historical development, which is merciless to the imperialists.
    What kind of era are we in today? From Latin America to Africa, the national liberation movement is magnificent and earth-shattering, setting off a new upsurge. The struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for national independence is not isolated. It is not only a part of the national liberation movement in Latin America or Africa, but also a part of the struggle of people all over the world for peace, democracy, and progress. The struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people for national independence has received the sympathy and support of the entire socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, as well as all people in the world who support national independence and advocate justice. We Chinese people have waged a long and brutal struggle against imperialism and finally achieved victory. Our fate is closely linked with the fate of all oppressed nations. We are even more excited about the victory of the Cuban people and even more concerned about the Congolese people who are waging a difficult struggle for their own independence and liberation. Let me once again express our firm support for the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism, our firm opposition to US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs, and our firm opposition to the Belgian colonialists' bloody massacre of the Congolese people. We firmly believe that the US imperialist aggressors and the Belgian colonialists will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat, and the Cuban and Congolese people will inevitably win the final victory.

    人民一定胜利是历史规律
    中国民主同盟副主席杨明轩的讲话亲爱的同胞们：
    在今天这个庄严的示威大会上，我代表中国民主同盟表示坚决支持古巴、刚果人民反对帝国主义的斗争，并对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政，比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民的血腥镇压表示无比的愤怒。
    古巴是古巴人民的古巴，刚果是刚果人民的刚果。古巴人民长期在美帝国主义及其走狗巴蒂斯塔政权的统治下，不堪奴役与剥削，历次暴发了武装起义，经过长期的斗争，终于在今年1月1日彻底打倒了美帝国主义支持的独裁政权，成立了临时政府，取得了完全的胜利。这个胜利给美帝国主义一个沉重的打击，给古巴人民，拉丁美洲人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一个莫大的鼓舞。美帝国主义是不甘心失败的，他仍无耻地在叫嚣、威胁、阴谋企图阻碍古巴临时政府惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子，古巴临时政府的这一措施是得到全体古巴人民支持的，这是完全符合古巴人民的利益，这是古巴的内政，任何外国都没有权利进行干涉。
    在古巴人民革命斗争取得辉煌胜利的同时，远在非洲大陆的刚果也发出了“刚果独立万岁！”“比利时人滚回欧洲去！”的震撼非洲的呼声，刚果人民在比利时殖民统治下过了八十年暗无天日惨无人道的生活，人民长期受着监禁、流放、疾病、死亡的威胁，刚果人民深深地了解，只有在打碎殖民主义者强加在他们身上的枷锁以后才能获得独立、自由。十多年以来，刚果人民和比利时殖民主义者展开无数次激烈的斗争，爱国烈士们的血没有白流，人民起义运动日益壮大发展，今天非洲民族解放运动掀起了新的高潮。刚果人民英勇地站立起来，和殖民主义者展开了无情的斗争。比利时殖民主义者也和美帝国主义一样是不甘心失败的，他们对刚果人民进行了疯狂地镇压和屠杀，但刚果人民的反抗怒火像火山爆发一样，是镇压不下去的。
    一切帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。十年前我们中国国内外一切帝国主义和反动派在中国人民面前遭到了惨败，这是历史证实了的。今天，在拉丁美洲的古巴又一次得到了证实，在非洲的刚果也将得到证实。这是历史的发展规律，对帝国主义者来说是铁面无情的。
    今天，在我们眼前是个什么时代呢？从拉丁美洲到非洲民族解放运动波澜壮阔雷霆万钧，已掀起了一个新的高潮。古巴人民、刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争不是孤立的，它不仅是拉丁美洲，或是非洲的民族解放运动的一部分，也是全世界人民争取和平、民主和进步的斗争的一部分。古巴、刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争，得到了以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营，以及世界上一切拥护民族独立和主张正义的人们的同情和支持。我们中国人民长期和帝国主义进行了残酷的斗争，最后取得了胜利，我们和一切被压迫民族的命运是息息相关的，我们为古巴人民的胜利更加感到兴奋，对为自己的独立解放而进行着艰苦斗争的刚果人民更加关怀。让我再一次表示我们坚决支持古巴、刚果人民反对帝国主义的斗争，我们坚决反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政，我们坚决反对比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民的血腥屠杀。我们完全相信，美帝国主义侵略者、比利时殖民主义者必然遭到可耻的失败，古巴、刚果人民必然获得最后的胜利。
