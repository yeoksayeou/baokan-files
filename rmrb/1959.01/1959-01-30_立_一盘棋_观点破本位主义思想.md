    Establish the "Whole Chessboard" Viewpoint to Break Down Departmentalism

    In our socialist country, economic work and other work should have a "whole chessboard" mentality. The various departments and undertakings of a socialist country should, under the overall planning and arrangement, give full play to their initiative and active role, with both overall planning and division of labor and cooperation, mutually serving as conditions and premises. For example, it is necessary to develop both industry and agriculture; in industry, it is necessary to develop both heavy industry and light industry; there must be both smelting and mining; there must be both manufacturing and repair; there must be both production organizations and service departments; there must be both cutting-edge and general, and so on. The development of each department should be carried out in a certain proportion according to the actual situation, otherwise there will be weak links and narrow zones, which will cause imbalance and confusion in the entire work. Of course, it does not mean that emphasizing the "whole chessboard" at the national or city level prevents the departments from playing any initiative; on the contrary, only when each department, under the overall plan and arrangement of the nation and the city, makes every effort to tap its potential can it ensure overall leaps forward and drive the development of other departments. In last year's Great Leap Forward, under the guidance of the national plan with steel as the key link, the communist style of mutual support, mutual cooperation, and common progress among the various departments was greatly promoted, thus ensuring the realization of the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an overall leap forward. This is the result of the guidance of the "whole chessboard" thinking. However, in our actual work, there are still various forms of departmentalism, and this kind of departmentalism thinking and work style is clearly exposed when encountering certain contradictions and difficulties.

    Departmentalism, whether out of "good intentions" or malice, always fails to take into account the overall requirements, always violates the deployment of the whole chessboard, always creates or increases everyone's difficulties, and actually plays a destructive and disruptive role in socialist construction. For example, only caring about completing one's own output value or targets, regardless of whether other departments need it; only caring about changing one's own production and arbitrarily abandoning cooperation contracts; only caring about engaging in technical equipment to arm oneself, while being very passive and indifferent to supporting others; only caring about seizing more materials and funds, disobeying overall mobilization and arrangements, and even resorting to unscrupulous means to poach other people's labor and materials; having advanced experience, but not helping others to improve together, but covering up and blocking it, refusing visits and learning, etc., all belong to this category.

    Departmentalism is actually a reflection of a capitalist business viewpoint and style, which is opposed to communist ideology. To establish a communist style, it is necessary to break down departmentalism and make the "whole chessboard" thinking thoroughly and firmly established in various departments and units. We must tell all those who consciously or "unconsciously" have departmentalism thinking that our real "position" is a chess piece in the whole chessboard. If we clarify this "position," we will not commit departmentalism again, and we can truly play our due role as a screw in this huge socialist machine.

### 立“一盘棋”观点破本位主义思想

    立“一盘棋”观点破本位主义思想
    在我们社会主义国家搞经济工作和其他工作，都应该有“一盘棋”的思想。社会主义国家的各部门、各种事业都要在一个总的计划安排之下，充分发挥自己的主动积极作用，既有全面规划，又有分工协作，彼此互为条件和前提。例如，既要发展工业，也要发展农业；在工业中既要发展重工业，也要发展轻工业；既要有冶炼，也要有采掘；既要有制造，也要有修理；既要有生产组织，也要有服务部门；既要有尖端，也要有一般等等。各个部门的发展应当根据实际情况按照一定的比例进行，否则就要出现薄弱环节和狭窄地带，就会引起整个工作的失调和混乱。当然，并不是说，强调了全国一盘棋或全市一盘棋就不能发挥各部门的任何主动性了，恰恰相反，只有各部门在全国全市总的计划安排下，都尽可能地发掘潜力，才能保证全面的跃进和带动其它部门的发展。在去年大跃进中，在以钢为纲的全国计划的指导下，各部门互相支援、互相协作、共同前进的共产主义风格是大大发扬了，因此就保证了以钢为纲、全面跃进方针的实现。这正是“全国一盘棋”思想指导的结果。但是，在我们实际工作中也还存在着各式各样的本位主义现象，这种本位主义思想作风，一遇到某些矛盾和困难，就明显地暴露出来了。
    本位主义，不管是出于“好心”或恶意，总不能顾全而是违反整体的要求，总不是促进而是破坏一盘棋的部署，总是造成或增加大家的困难，对社会主义建设实际上起着破坏与扰乱作用。例如，只顾自己完成产值或指标，不管其它部门是否需要；只顾自己改变生产，可以随便废弃协作合同；只顾搞技术设备武装自己，对支援别人则很消极冷淡；只顾多抓材料、资金，不服从全面调动与安排，甚至不择手段去挖别人的劳动力和材料；有了先进经验，不是帮助别人共同提高，而是掩盖封锁，拒绝参观学习等等都属于这一类。
    本位主义实际上是一种资本主义经营观点作风的反映，它和共产主义思想是对立的，要树立共产主义风格，就要大破本位主义，使一盘棋思想彻底在各种部门、各个单位中牢固地树立起来。要告诉所有自觉或“不自觉”地有本位主义思想的人，我们真的“本位”，就是一盘棋中的一枚棋子，明确了这个“位”，就不至于再犯本位主义，就可以真正在社会主义这个庞大的机器中起到自己应有的螺丝钉作用。
