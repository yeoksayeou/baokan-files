    Grandpa's Paper Flowers
    Jin Jin

    There was an old grandpa, and he had a great talent. The paper flowers he made could turn into real flowers. These paper flowers, when planted in the ground, could grow and bloom into even more beautiful and fragrant flowers. For example, he would make roses out of red paper, with leaves and stems. The leaves were made of green paper, and the stems were made of twigs. After he made them, he would stick them in the soil, water them, and they would come to life. The roses would emit fragrance and bloom more and more every day.

    Everyone knew that the paper flowers made by this grandpa could turn into real flowers, so they all asked him to make them. Some wanted chrysanthemums, some wanted plum blossoms, some wanted him to make red pomegranate flowers that could bloom in winter; and some, in the summer, wanted him to make winter-blooming narcissus. No matter what kind of paper flower it was, as long as it was made by the grandpa, it would turn into a real flower.

    Why could the grandpa's paper flowers come to life when planted in the soil? Why could they turn into fragrant and beautiful fresh flowers? Because the paper flowers made by the grandpa were exactly like real flowers, not even a bit different, extremely similar. The paper flowers made by others were not as good as his, and could not turn into living flowers.

    Later, the grandpa became very old, and he wanted to teach his skill to others, so that they could also make them. So he took in an apprentice. This apprentice followed the grandpa every day to learn. The grandpa made a peony flower, and he also learned to make a peony flower. The one made by the grandpa, when stuck into the soil and watered, would come to life and emit a fragrant scent. The one made by the little apprentice, when stuck into the soil, was still a paper flower, not alive at all, and not fragrant. The grandpa took a close look and saw that the petals made by the little apprentice were very messy, and the leaves were not glued on properly. The grandpa said:

    "Little apprentice, you have to make it again."

    The little apprentice hurriedly made another one and stuck it into the soil, but the paper flower was still a paper flower, and still could not come to life. The grandpa said:

    "Make another one for me to see."

    The little apprentice did not want to make any more. He stretched and said to the grandpa:

    "Master, I am very tired from making them. I want to go to sleep."

    Before the grandpa could say anything, he went to bed and fell asleep.

    The grandpa was angry, and he shook his head and said:

    "You are really a lazy apprentice. Not like a frog, but like a toad, cannot croak, cannot jump, only loves to sleep all day long."

    Days passed, the grandpa became too old and died. He would never make paper flowers again, and everyone could no longer buy the good paper flowers he made.

    The lazy apprentice did not learn anything. The paper flowers he made were still paper flowers when stuck into the soil, could not come to life no matter what, were not fragrant, and not beautiful at all.

    The grandpa's good skills were not passed down, what a pity. The lazy apprentice regretted it more and more, but what was the use of regretting?

    From that time on, fragrant and beautiful living paper flowers could no longer be seen, and those who made paper flowers could no longer make paper flowers like the grandpa's. That is to blame the lazy apprentice for not being willing to learn properly. (Attached picture)

### 老公公做的纸花

    给幼儿园小朋友多讲些故事
    老公公做的纸花
    金近
    有个老公公，他的本领挺大挺大，他做的纸花，能变成真的花，这种纸花，种在地上还能长大，还能开出更多的鲜花来，又香又好看。比如说吧，他用红纸做出玫瑰花，有叶子，有梗子，叶子是绿纸做的，梗子是树枝条做的。他做好以后，插在泥土里，再浇上些水，就活起来了，这玫瑰花就会发出香味来，还会一天一天开出很多花来。
    大家知道这个老公公做的纸花能变成真花，都叫他来做了。有的要做菊花，有的要做梅花，有的要他做红红的石榴花，就能在冬天开出来；有的到了夏天，要他做冬天开的水仙花。不管做什么纸花，只要是老公公做的，都会变出真花来。
    老公公做的纸花，插在泥土里，为什么能活起来呢？为什么能变成又香又好看的鲜花呢？因为老公公做的纸花，跟真的鲜花一模一样，一点也不差，像极啦。别人做的纸花就没有他做得那样好，就不会变成活的鲜花。
    后来，老公公的年纪很大了，他想把自己的本领教给别人，让别人也会做，他就收了一个徒弟。这个徒弟天天跟着老公公学，老公公做一朵牡丹花，他也学着做一朵牡丹花。老公公做的这一朵，插到泥土里去，浇上水，就活起来了，还发出喷喷香的香味来。这个小徒弟做的那一朵，插到泥土里去，还是一朵纸花，一点也不活，也不香。老公公细细一看，原来这个小徒弟做的花瓣是很乱的，叶子也没有粘好。老公公说：
    “小徒弟，你得重新做过。”
    小徒弟急急忙忙地又做了一朵，插到泥土里去，纸花还是纸花，还是活不起来。老公公说：
    “你再做一朵给我看看。”
    小徒弟不高兴做了，他伸个懒腰，对老公公说：
    “师父，我做得累极啦，我要去睡觉啦。”
    老公公还没有说话，他就到床上去睡觉了。
    老公公生气了，他摇摇头说：
    “你真是一个懒徒弟。不像一只青蛙，倒像一只癞哈蟆，不会叫，也不会跳，整天只爱睡懒觉。”
    日子一天天过去，老公公年纪太大了，死了。他再也不会做纸花啦，大家再也买不到他做的好纸花啦。
    那个懒徒弟，他什么也没有学会，他做出来的纸花，插在泥土里还是纸花，怎么也活不起来，怎么也不香，一点不好看。
    老公公的那套好本领，就没有传下来，多可惜啊。那个懒徒弟越想越后悔，他后悔有什么用呀？
    从那时候起，又香又好看的活纸花就看不到了，做纸花的人也做不出老公公那样的纸花了，那就要怪懒徒弟不肯好好学。（附图片）
