    Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 14th Dispatch: Inspired by the victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista dictatorship, exiles from Latin American countries residing in Venezuela have organized political organizations against dictatorial rule in Caracas and Maracaibo and are actively engaged in activities.
    According to a report in the "Universal" newspaper on January 7, the Anti-Dictatorship Committee formed in Maracaibo has the participation of exiles from Nicaragua, Paraguay, and other places. The committee declared that its purpose is to fight against dictatorial rule in Latin America and the Franco regime in Spain. The same day, the "Universal" also said that the purpose of the January 1st Movement Women's Committee established in Caracas is to help liberate the Dominican Republic, which has been "suppressed by the dictator Trujillo for twenty-nine years."
    The January 1st Movement is named after the dates when the Venezuelan dictator Pérez Jiménez was driven away in early 1958 and Batista was driven away from Cuba this year.
    The newspaper also stated that to provide funding for the movement to overthrow the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua, national university groups are issuing "Freedom Bonds" for the establishment of an organization called Freedom for Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Citizens Committee, entrusted with the sale of these bonds, has representative groups in Caracas and Maracaibo.

    在古巴人民胜利的鼓舞下
    拉丁美洲反独裁斗争高涨
    一些在委内瑞拉的流亡者积极展开活动
    新华社14日讯　加拉加斯消息：在古巴人民取得推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的胜利鼓舞下，居住在委内瑞拉的拉丁美洲国家的流亡者在加拉加斯和马拉开波组织了反对独裁统治的政治组织，并且正在积极进行活动。
    据1月7日的“宇宙报”报道，在马拉开波已经组成的反独裁统治委员会，有来自尼加拉瓜和巴拉圭等地的流亡者参加。该委员会声明，其宗旨为同拉丁美洲的独裁统治和西班牙的佛朗哥政权进行斗争。同一天的“宇宙报”还说，在加拉加斯成立的一月一日运动妇女委员会的宗旨是帮助解放“遭到独裁者特鲁希略压制二十九年”的多米尼加共和国。
    一月一日运动是以1958年初撵走委内瑞拉独裁者佩雷兹·希门尼斯和今年赶走古巴的巴蒂斯塔的日子取名的。
    这家报纸还说，为打垮尼加拉瓜的索摩查独裁统治的运动提供经费，全国大学团体正在为成立称之为尼加拉瓜自由的组织而发行“自由公债”。受委托出售这种公债的尼加拉瓜公民委员会在加拉加斯和马拉开波都有代表小组。
