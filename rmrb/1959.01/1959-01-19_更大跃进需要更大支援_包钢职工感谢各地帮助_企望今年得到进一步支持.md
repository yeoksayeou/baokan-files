The builders of Baotou Steel sincerely thank all sides for their support, and they urgently need greater assistance from various regions in the matter of complete sets of materials and equipment.

Speaking of support, they always think of Anshan Iron and Steel first. "Anshan Iron and Steel is like Baotou Steel's maternal home; Baotou Steel lacks something, it goes back to its maternal home to ask for it." In December of last year, when the No. 4 coke oven of the Baotou Steel Coking Plant was being baked, thermocouples were nowhere to be found. Without them, the temperature could not be measured, and the oven could not be baked. In the end, forty of them were taken from the warehouse of Anshan Iron and Steel, which ensured the early baking of the oven. Anshan Iron and Steel has also made great efforts in terms of construction and production technology. On the construction site of Baotou Steel, you can meet people from Anshan Iron and Steel everywhere. As the person in charge of Baotou Steel said well: It is very difficult to build such a modern large-scale iron and steel enterprise like Baotou Steel without a large industrial base like Anshan Iron and Steel.

Many factories regard rushing to manufacture equipment for Baotou Steel as their important production task, which left a very deep impression on the workers of Baotou Steel. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory delivered most of the equipment it manufactured for Baotou Steel last year half a year ahead of schedule. They took the initiative to find drawings for the forty-ton weighing car needed for the large blast furnace manufactured for Baotou Steel, striving for time and stepping up production to ensure that it caught up with the use of the No. 1 blast furnace. The workers of Shanxi Machine Factory created advanced methods for the furnace doors, furnace door frames, protective plates, bridge pipes and other equipment manufactured for the Baotou Steel coking oven, and the delivery time was greatly advanced. Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant and Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant both took supporting Baotou Steel as a powerful mobilization slogan.

The railway and highway transportation departments have adopted positive measures of "making way for steel" to rush materials to Baotou Steel. The Air Force of the People's Liberation Army and the motor vehicle units of the Beijing Military Region also participated in the transportation front here from thousands of miles away. The Ministry of Railways took great pains to transport the furnace top equipment of the No. 1 blast furnace. The diameter of the furnace cover is 4.8 meters, and it is not wide enough to put it horizontally in the carriage, and it exceeds the specified height when it is erected. There are more than 1,600 kilometers from Shenyang to Baotou, and several station bridges and more than 60 mountain tunnels in the Fengsha section have to be passed in the middle. The railway transportation department is determined to overcome all difficulties and send this behemoth to Baotou.

The workers of Baotou Steel once said this way: If the construction of Baotou Steel in 1958 has already taken shape roughly, then, first of all, it should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party and the support from all sides.

However, for Baotou Steel, 1958 was only the beginning of construction. 1959 is the peak of Baotou Steel's industrial construction. Within this year, on the one hand, it is necessary to achieve "three outputs" – output of iron, output of steel, output of large steel; on the other hand, it is necessary to carry out large-scale construction. Therefore, the demand for manpower and material resources is very large. According to the person in charge of Baotou Steel: At present, the biggest problem in equipment and materials is still the problem of complete supply, and whether large-scale equipment can be matched on time is the key to the smooth construction of Baotou Steel. For example, the No. 1 blast furnace will be put into production in the second quarter. However, the central nervous system of the blast furnace – the switchboard of the hoist – cannot be completed. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently.

The processing and manufacturing of non-standard equipment cannot keep up with production and construction, which also needs to be solved. According to calculations, about 8,000 to 9,000 tons of non-standard equipment are needed in the first quarter of this year, and the non-standard equipment required for the whole year is equivalent to a quarter of the total amount of equipment. When Anshan Iron and Steel was built that year, dozens of factories in industrial cities such as Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin processed non-standard equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel. Today, in the construction of Baotou Steel, there is also a need for several factories to specialize in processing non-standard equipment for Baotou Steel.

In addition, regarding the procurement of hardware, electrical materials, chemical industry and other self-produced and self-sold materials, in the eyes of some people, it may be insignificant trivial things. In fact, although soldiers are small, they are all related to the whole game. For example, the grinding wheel for grinding refractory bricks is a small material, but without it, it will affect the bricklaying of the blast furnace. This year, Baotou Steel needs more than 1,200 kinds of tools such as turning tools and milling cutters, and thousands of small hardware equipment and tools are needed for a single construction project. It is impossible to meet the requirements by relying on one city alone, and the commercial departments of Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hunan and other places need to actively help.

### 更大跃进需要更大支援  包钢职工感谢各地帮助　企望今年得到进一步支持

    更大跃进需要更大支援
    包钢职工感谢各地帮助　企望今年得到进一步支持
    本报讯　包钢的建设者衷心感谢各方面的支援，他们迫切需要各地在材料设备配套问题上给以更大的支援。
    谈起支援，他们首先总是想起鞍钢。“鞍钢就像包钢的娘家，包钢缺什么就回娘家去要”。去年12月，包钢焦化厂四号焦炉烘炉时，到处买不到热电偶。没有它就无法测量温度，也就不能烘炉。后来还是从鞍钢的仓库里拿来四十多支，才保证了提前烘炉。在建筑和生产技术力量方面，鞍钢也作了很大的努力。在包钢的工地上，哪里都会遇到来自鞍钢的人。包钢负责人说得好：建设包钢这样一个现代化的大型钢铁企业，没有像鞍钢那样大的工业基地是很不好办的。
    许多工厂对于赶制包钢的设备看成自己的重要生产任务，给包钢职工留下极深刻的印象。大连工矿车辆厂去年替包钢制造的设备，大都提前半年交出产品。他们为包钢制造大高炉上需要的四十吨秤量车，曾主动地找寻图纸，争取时间，加紧赶制，保证赶上一号高炉的使用。山西机器厂职工们为包钢焦炉制造的炉门、炉门框、保护板、桥管等设备，创造了先进方法，交货时间大大提前。富拉尔基重型机械厂、沈阳重型机械厂都把支援包钢作为有力的动员口号。
    铁路和公路运输部门采取了“为钢铁让路”的积极措施，为包钢赶运物资。人民解放军空军部队、北京军区的汽车部队，也不远千里参加了这里的运输战线。铁道部承运一号高炉炉顶设备，曾经煞费苦心。炉盖的直径四米八，横着放车厢不够宽，竖起来又超过了规定的高度。从沈阳到包头共有一千六百多公里的路程，中间还要经过几个站桥和丰沙段的六十多个山洞。铁道运输部门决心克服一切困难，把这个庞然大物送到包头。
    包钢的职工们曾经这样说：如果说1958年包钢的建设已经粗具规模的话，那末，首先应当归功于党的正确领导和各方面的支援。
    但是，1958年，对于包钢来说，还仅仅是建设的开始。1959年才是包钢工业建设的高峰。今年这一年内，一方面要实现“三出”——出铁、出钢、出大型钢材；另一方面要进行大规模施工。因此，人力、物力的需要量都很大。据包钢负责人谈：目前，设备材料中最大的问题，仍然是成套供应问题，大型设备能否按时配套，是包钢建设顺利进行的关键。比如一号高炉第二季度就要投入生产了。但是高炉的神经中枢——卷扬机的配电盘还不能成套。这是迫切需要解决的问题。
    非标准设备的加工制造赶不上生产建设，也需要解决。据计算今年第一季度就需要非标准设备约八、九千吨，全年所需的非标准设备相当于设备总量的四分之一。当年鞍钢建设时，大连、沈阳、长春、哈尔滨等工业城市的几十个工厂，都为鞍钢加工非标准设备。今天，在包钢建设中也需要有若干个工厂专门为包钢加工非标准设备。
    另外，关于五金、电料、化工等自产自销材料的采购，在有些人看来，也许是无关大局的零碎东西。其实，兵卒虽小，都与全棋有关。比如磨耐火砖的砂轮是小材料，但没有它就要影响高炉砌砖。今年包钢所需的车刀、铣刀等工具有一千二百多种，一项工程施工就需要成千上万件小五金器材工具。单靠哪一个城市都不能满足要求，需要北京、上海、辽宁、黑龙江、湖南等地的商业部门积极帮助。
