The "Wenyi Bao" last year launched a discussion on the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and so far, nine articles have been published, along with detailed reports on this discussion. The first issue of this year continues with Chen Baichen's article "Ideal Characters on Stage and Others."

The author said: Many comrades say that fantasy, exaggeration... etc., are frequently used techniques of romanticism, but these are not equivalent to romanticism itself. I also agree with this opinion.

Speaking of the combination of realism and romanticism in opera, everyone mentions "The Legend of the White Snake's" Flooding of Jinshan Temple, "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai's" transformation into butterflies, "The Injustice to Dou E's" June snowfall, etc. These plots all have strong romantic fantasy and imagination. The Monkey King and Pigsy on stage, like in the novel "Journey to the West," are completely imaginative characters, and are also well-known romantic creations, but these bold fantasies and imaginations themselves do not constitute romanticism. The serial opera "Investiture of the Gods" and "Ji Gong the Living Buddha," which also depict fantasy gods and monsters like "Journey to the West," do not become romantic works. It can be seen that if fantasy and imagination are not attached to anything, they do not become romanticism. The scene of Flooding of Jinshan Temple in "The Legend of the White Snake" is convincing after writing about Bai Niangzi's unwavering love for Xu Xian, writing about Fahai's unreasonable persecution of them, and writing about Bai Niangzi and Xiaoqing's heroic struggle against Fahai.

There is another type of character on our opera stage: Zhuge Liang in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" operas, Wu Song in "Water Margin," Mu Guiying in the "Generals of the Yang Family" operas, and Bao Gong, excluding his activities in the underworld, are all ideal characters full of romantic color. The common feature of these characters is that they are exaggerated to the point of being almost perfect. But exaggeration in itself is not equivalent to romanticism. "The Water Margin Sequel" depicts a Chen Liqing who defeats all the heroes on Liangshan, and this character is exaggerated beyond exaggeration, but Chen Liqing does not become a character with romantic color. It can be seen that exaggeration must also be combined with certain things in the character to have romantic characteristics. If Zhuge Liang did not have the spirit of "dedicating himself to the task until his dying day" and resourceful talent, he could not be exaggerated into the embodiment of wisdom on the stage who could predict the enemy like a god; if Li Kui was not completely loyal to Liangshanbo, he could not be exaggerated into a perfect figure loyal to the peasant revolutionary cause.

Therefore, neither fantasy and imagination nor exaggeration in themselves can become romanticism. They form romanticism only after being combined with certain concrete things. This concrete thing is the positive character that the author attempts to affirm, and that the broad masses of people have already affirmed, as well as their heroic actions and struggles.

Characters like Bai Niangzi and Zhuge Liang, no matter how much romanticism is endowed on them, they are first and foremost realistic. Because these characters are built on the foundation of realism, romanticism has something to attach to. Otherwise, romanticism will become water without a source, a tree without roots. Moreover, the more solid the foundation of realism, the more vast the world romanticism can gain to gallop freely. When realism and romanticism are well combined, the stronger the realism, the more intense the romanticism, and the two are directly proportional (of course, this refers to the spirit). Conversely, if romanticism is not based on expressing realism, or if this foundation is very weak, it is difficult for the two to combine; even if they are forced to combine, such romanticism will inevitably be very false and appear pale and weak.

Romanticism must be combined with realism, just as ideals must be combined with a spirit of practice. If a writer's ideal is truly his own, and not borrowed from others, it is inseparable from his worldview. Romanticism is generated through realism, and is a requirement of the writer's ideal naturally expressed through realism.

### 革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合

专栏：论文摘要

    革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合
    去年“文艺报”开展了关于革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合问题的讨论，到现在为止已经发表了九篇论文，并作了较详细的关于这一个讨论的报道。今年第一期继续发表了陈白尘的“舞台上的理想人物及其他”一文。
    作者说：很多同志说，幻想、夸张……等等，都是浪漫主义经常使用的手法，但这些并不等于浪漫主义本身。我也同意这样的意见。
    说到戏曲里的现实主义和浪漫主义的结合，大家都提到“白蛇传”里的水漫金山，“梁山伯与祝英台”里的化蝶，“窦娥冤”里的六月飞雪等等。这些情节都具有浓烈的浪漫主义的幻想和想像。舞台上的孙悟空、猪八戒，和在“西游记”小说里一样，是完全出于想像的人物，也是人所共知的浪漫主义的创造，但这些大胆的幻想和想像的本身，并不成为浪漫主义。和“西游”记同样写幻想中的神怪人物的连台本戏“封神榜”以及“济公活佛”等等，并不成为浪漫主义的作品。可见幻想和想像如果无所附丽，就不成其为浪漫主义。“白蛇传”里水漫金山一场，是在写出白娘子对于许仙忠贞不二的爱情，写出法海对他们的无理迫害，写出白娘子和小青向法海进行了英勇的斗争之后，才使人信服的。
    我们戏曲舞台上还有另一类人物：“三国”戏里的诸葛亮，“水浒”中的武松，“杨家将”戏曲中的穆桂英等等，还有除去阴间活动那一面的包公，都是富于浪漫主义色彩的理想人物。这些人物的共同特点是被夸张得几乎都完美无缺。但夸张的本身也不等于浪漫主义，“荡寇志”里写了一个陈丽卿，把梁山上所有的英雄们都打败了，这个人物该是在夸张之上被夸张的了，但陈丽卿并不成为有浪漫主义色彩的人物。可见夸张也必须和人物身上某些东西相结合，才能具有浪漫主义的特色。如果诸葛亮没有“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”的精神和足智多谋的才能，就无法夸张为舞台上料敌如神的智慧的化身；李逵如果不是对梁山泊一片忠诚，也不能被夸张为忠于农民革命事业的完美的人物。
    因此，幻想和想像也罢，夸张也罢，其本身并不能成为浪漫主义。它们是和某些具体的东西结合后才形成浪漫主义。这个具体的东西便是作者所企图肯定，也是广大人民业已肯定的正面人物，以及他们的英雄行为和斗争。
    白娘子之类和诸葛亮之类的人物，不管他们身上被赋予的浪漫主义如何，他们首先是现实主义的。因为这些人物建筑在现实主义的基础上，浪漫主义才有所附丽。否则浪漫主义将成为无源之水，无根之木。而且现实主义的基础愈坚实，浪漫主义才能获得广阔的天地而驰骋自如。现实主义和浪漫主义结合得好，那就应该是现实主义性愈强，浪漫主义性也愈浓烈，二者是成正比例的（当然这是指的精神）。反之，如果浪漫主义不以表现现实主义为基础，或者这个基础很薄弱，则二者是很难结合的；即使强为结合，那样的浪漫主义也必然很虚假和显得苍白无力。
    浪漫主义必须与现实主义相结合。正如理想必须与实践精神相结合一样。作家的理想如果真正是他自己的理想，而不是向别人借用的，那是与他的世界观分不开的。浪漫主义是通过现实主义生发出来的，是作家的理想通过现实主义自然表现出来的一种要求。
