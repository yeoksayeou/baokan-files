Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: In the Great Leap Forward, China's civil aviation aircraft became an extraordinarily active "air assault force." According to statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in 1958, the total transport turnover of China's civil aviation increased by 48.1% compared to 1957, and the workload of specialized aviation, calculated by flight hours, increased by 76.6% compared to 1957. Among all indicators, the cargo transportation volume grew the fastest, nearly doubling compared to 1957.

	In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, civil aviation aircraft rushed large quantities of pesticides, fish fry, sheep breeds, dairy cows, pig feed, and crop seedlings and seeds to various places. During the days of the mass steelmaking campaign, civil aviation fleets continuously transported motors, blowers, and other equipment needed for steelmaking to various locations.

	In order to meet the needs of national economic development and people's lives, the civil aviation department opened nineteen new local routes last year.

	Last year, civil aviation professional aircraft carried out more than a dozen types of operations, such as controlling crop diseases and insect pests, sowing tree seeds, surveying wasteland, selecting railway lines, and artificial rainfall, making multifaceted contributions to accelerating socialist construction.

    “空中突击队”空前活跃
    去年民航运输总量比1957年增长48.1％
    据新华社9日讯　我国民航飞机在大跃进中成为一支异常活跃的“空中突击队”。据交通部民用航空局统计，1958年我国民用航空的运输总周转量比1957年增长了48.1％，专业航空按飞行小时计算的工作量比1957年增长了76.6％。在各项指标中增长得最快的货物运输量，比1957年将近翻了一番。
    在农业大跃进的高潮中，民航飞机把大批的农药、鱼苗、羊种、乳牛、生猪饲料和农作物的秧苗、种籽等赶运到各地。在全民炼钢的日子里民航机群为各地源源运送电动机、鼓风机和其他炼钢需要的设备。
    为了适应国民经济发展和人民生活的需要，民用航空部门去年共新辟了十九条地方航线。
    民航专业飞机去年进行了除治农作物病虫害、撒播树种、测量荒地、选择铁路线、人工降雨等十几种作业，为加速社会主义建设作出了多方面的贡献。
