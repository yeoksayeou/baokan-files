Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 6th: Erich Apel, Director of the Economic Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, published an article in a recent issue of "Economic Weekly," discussing the achievements of East Germany's economic construction in 1958. He said that, according to preliminary estimates, East Germany's industrial output increased by 10.7% in 1958, and this year's achievement is a significant step in enhancing the development speed of our country's socialist industry.

Apel said: East Germany has also achieved significant development in agriculture, transportation, and foreign trade. The total investment in 1958 was approximately 1.721 billion marks (German currency) higher than in 1957. The increase in investment and the significant increase in production in industry, agriculture, and transportation have laid a favorable foundation for solving the tasks of 1959 and rapidly developing the national economy.

Apel then discussed East Germany's economic construction tasks for 1959. He said: In 1959, East Germany's industrial output will increase by 11.1% compared to the already completed 1958 plan. Chemical industry production will increase by 9.7% compared to 1958. There will also be a large increase in the production of consumer goods, with woolen textiles alone increasing by 34.5%.

Apel said: The total investment in 1959 will increase by 19.8% compared to 1958. Some new factories will be put into production this year. For example, the production of bituminous coal bricks will increase by approximately 2.6 million tons, cement will increase by 750,000 tons, and electric motors will increase by 109,000 units.

Apel emphasized that the chemical industry will experience significant development, with investment in this area increasing by 40% this year compared to last year. Construction of oil refineries and chemical fiber complexes will begin. The expansion of the coal mining industry and power plants will also play an important role in 1959. The metallurgical industry will be greatly expanded, and light industry, especially the textile industry, will develop more rapidly.

Apel said: In agriculture, the socialist transformation of agriculture will be vigorously carried out this year, increasing livestock products and grain yield per unit area.

Apel finally talked about the development of education. He said that in 1959, universities and normal schools will enroll 21,400 new students. This year, there will be nearly 14,000 university graduates and approximately 24,000 technical school graduates.

    阿佩耳说：民主德国在农业、交通运输和对外贸易方面也取得了重大的发展。1958年的投资总额大概比1957年增加十七亿二千一百万马克（德币名）。投资额的增长以及工农业和交通运输业生产的大大增加，为解决1959年的任务和快速度发展国民经济打下了有利基础。
    阿佩耳接着谈到民主德国1959年的经济建设任务。他说：在1959年，民主德国工业产量将比已经完成的1958年计划增加11.1％。化学工业生产量将比1958年增加9.7％。在消费品工业生产方面，也将有很大增长，仅毛织品即将增加34.5％。
    阿佩耳说：1959年投资总额将比1958年增加19.8％。今年将有一些新工厂投入生产。比如，烟煤砖产量将约增加二百六十万吨，水泥将增加七十五万吨，电动机将增加十万九千台。
    阿佩耳强调说：化学工业将有很大发展，1959年在这方面的投资额将比去年增加40％，将开始建设炼油厂和化学纤维联合厂。采煤工业和发电厂的扩大也将在1959年中占重要地位。冶金工业将大大扩大，轻工业、特别是纺织工业将更快地发展。
    阿佩耳说：在农业方面，今年将大力进行农业的社会主义改造，增加畜产品以及谷物单位面积产量。
    阿佩耳最后谈到教育事业的发展。他说，1959年，各大学和师范学校将招收两万一千四百名新生。今年，大学毕业生将近一万四千名，技术专科学校的毕业生约有两万四千人。
