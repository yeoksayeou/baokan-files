Xinhua News Agency reports: Kishi Nobusuke, the candidate of the "mainstream faction" of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, manipulated power and, taking advantage of the "anti-mainstream faction's" lack of preparation, was reelected as president of the Liberal Democratic Party at the party convention held on January 24.

The "anti-mainstream faction" of the Liberal Democratic Party issued a statement after the election, expressing respect for the results of the presidential election and stating that they would take a cooperative attitude when the Diet passes the 1959 budget. However, the internal struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party has not been eliminated. First, although Kishi Nobusuke received 320 votes, this was 30 votes less than the "mainstream faction" was confident it could achieve. On the other hand, the losing "anti-mainstream faction" candidate, Matsumura Kenzo, received 166 votes, exceeding the 100 votes predicted by the Kishi Nobusuke group, accounting for one-third of the total votes of the convention delegates. Kyodo News commented on the election results, saying that for Kishi Nobusuke, "the anti-mainstream faction will be like a ticking time bomb in the future." The "anti-mainstream faction" issued a statement after the election, asking Kishi Nobusuke to pay full attention to the significance of the votes received by Matsumura Kenzo, and expressed their determination to "not change their determination to strive to refresh the party's style" and to "eliminate politics that rely on money and power for promotion."

Japan's monopoly capitalist groups believe that although Kishi Nobusuke has been re-elected as president, his future will still be fraught with difficulties. The economic circles in the Kansai region of Japan even believe that after this year's House of Councillors election, the Liberal Democratic Party may face the danger of splitting.

    岸信介重新当选日自由民主党总裁
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：日本执政的自由民主党“主流派”总裁候选人岸信介，玩弄权术，乘“反主流派”准备不够的情况，在1月24日举行的党代表大会上重新当选为自由民主党的总裁。
    自由民主党“反主流派”在选举后发表声明，表示尊重选举总裁的结果，并且将在国会会议上通过1959年度预算时采取协助的态度。但是，自由民主党的内部斗争并没有消除。首先，岸信介虽然得了三百二十票，但比“主流派”自信可以达到的票数少三十票。而落选的“反主流派”候选人松村谦三获得一百六十六票，超过了岸信介集团所预料的一百票，占大会代表的总票数的三分之一。共同社评论这次选举结果说：对岸信介说来，“反主流派今后将成为好像一颗定时炸弹的存在”。“反主流派”选举后发表声明，要岸信介充分注视松村谦三所得票数的意义，并表示“将不改变争取刷新党风”的决心，要“排除依靠金钱和权利来推行的政治”。
    日本垄断资本集团认为，岸信介虽然重新当选了总裁，但是他的前途仍然将是困难重重。日本关西地区的经济界甚至认为，在今年参议院选举以后，自由民主党有可能发生分裂危险。
