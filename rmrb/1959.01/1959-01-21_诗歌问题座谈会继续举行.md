    Poetry Problem Symposium Continues
    On January 16, we held the second symposium on poetry issues. Those present included Ding Li, He Qifang, Sha Ou, Li Guangtian, Lin Mohan, Shao Quanlin, Lin Lin, Song Lei, Xu Chi, He Jingzhi, Guo Xiaochuan, Xiao San, etc. At the meeting, He Qifang, Ding Li, Xiao San, and others made speeches, and Xu Chi and Song Lei submitted written opinions (the excerpts of the speeches by Comrades Xu Chi and Song Lei published today are summaries of their written opinions).
    Regarding whether the folk song style has limitations, there are roughly two opinions: one believes that the folk song style has limitations in syntax and genre. It is bound to be somewhat restrictive to express complex new life. One opinion is that the five- and seven-character folk song style has no limitations in expressing today's new life, and the success of new folk songs expressing the Great Leap Forward shows its strong vitality. It can be used as a more common form, the basic form of poetry. Regarding the mainstream of poetry, some people think that it is not necessary to raise the issue of the mainstream. Others believe that the new poetry since the May Fourth Movement has achievements, but also has great shortcomings. Its form is greatly influenced by foreign countries, and the working people are not accustomed to it and do not like it. The current facts themselves show that new folk songs are the mainstream of poetry.
    At the meeting, many comrades believed that Li Yaqun's criticism of the Hong Bailing's disdain for new folk songs in "My Opinion on the Issue of Poetry Going Down to the Countryside" ("Stars" November 1958 issue) was correct.
    The symposium unanimously agreed that discussions and articles should be approached with a realistic attitude. In conducting debates, generalizations or citations of others' arguments should be as accurate and comprehensive as possible.
    Finally, everyone felt that the current discussion was meaningful and that further discussions should be held on some fundamental issues in the future. The preliminary topics for discussion are as follows:
    1. On the issue of developing new poetry based on folk songs and classical poetry; 2. On the development and improvement of new folk songs; 3. On the issue of the form of poetry, including national forms and modern metrical poetry; 4. On the evaluation of the new poetry movement since the May Fourth Movement.

### 诗歌问题座谈会继续举行

    诗歌问题座谈会继续举行
    1月16日，我们召开了诗歌问题的第二次座谈会。到会的有丁力、何其芳、沙鸥、李广田、林默涵、邵荃麟、林林、宋垒、徐迟、贺敬之、郭小川、萧三等。会上，何其芳、丁力、萧三等作了发言，徐迟、宋垒写了书面意见（今天发表的徐迟和宋垒同志的发言就是他们的书面意见的摘要）。
    关于民歌体是否有限制的问题，大致有两种意见：一种认为民歌体在句法、体裁上有限制。要表现复杂的新生活不能不有所束缚。一种意见认为五、七言的民歌体，表现今天的新生活没有限制，表现大跃进的新民歌的成功说明了它的生命力是强的。它可以作为一种比较普遍的形式，诗歌的基本形式。关于诗歌的主流问题，有人认为不一定要提主流的问题。也有人认为“五四”以来的新诗有成绩，但也有很大缺点，它的形式受外来的影响很大，劳动人民不习惯，不喜爱。当前的事实本身说明了新民歌是诗歌的主流。
    会上，许多同志认为李亚群在“我对诗歌下放问题的意见”（“星星”1958年11月号）一文中对红百灵的轻视新民歌的批评是对的。
    座谈会一致认为，进行讨论，发表文章，应该采取实事求是的态度。在进行论争时，无论概括或引用别人的论点，应力求准确和全面。
    最后，大家觉得现在的讨论是有意义的，今后应进一步就一些根本性的问题进行讨论。讨论题目初步拟定如下：
    一、关于在民歌和古典诗歌基础上发展新诗的问题；二、关于新民歌的发展和提高问题；三、关于诗歌的形式问题，包括民族形式和现代格律诗等问题；四、关于“五四”以来新诗运动的估价问题。
