Key figures from China's various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as model workers from industry and agriculture, representatives of youth, women, and the People's Liberation Army, and many well-known scientists, were invited to attend the symposium. Everyone unanimously cheered and expressed heartfelt congratulations on another great and glorious achievement made by the Soviet people.
