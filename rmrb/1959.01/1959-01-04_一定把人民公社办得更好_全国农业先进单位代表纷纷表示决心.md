Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: Representatives attending the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction have expressed their determination to go back and work hard.

During the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, the representatives conscientiously studied the Communiqué of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes." Combining this with several reports by central leading comrades at the meeting, they conducted relatively full discussions on the nature of the People's Commune, the production policy of the commune, the democratic management of the commune, distribution and livelihood issues, and the combination of revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic approach.

The representatives believed that studying the two documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and listening to the reports of the central responsible comrades was their greatest gain from participating in this meeting. It not only clarified their understanding of the international and domestic situation, but also gave them a further understanding of the principles and policies for developing production and running the People's Commune well. They also deeply felt the great significance of the people's commune movement. As some representatives said: The central documents have enlightened us, and all the main problems in carrying out the people's commune movement have been arranged. During the discussion, the representatives cited many facts to affirm that the current People's Commune has more advantages than the advanced agricultural production cooperative.

During the meeting, the representatives also exchanged opinions on how to run the commune well and consolidate the commune. Some representatives proposed that in the next few months of consolidating the commune, several things should be done well: first, organize cadres to conscientiously study the Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, unify understanding, improve thinking, and promote production through the consolidation of the commune, improve life, improve the management and distribution of the commune, reasonably arrange the distribution ratio of the state, the commune, and individuals, and clearly explain the policies on financial and life issues that the masses are most concerned about. Some delegations also proposed that they should promote a democratic style and a realistic style when they return, so as to run the commune well.

The representatives believed in the discussion that the central government's proposed policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery is very correct. The representatives believed that doing so can not only make economic construction develop rapidly, but also increase the income of commune members, meet the needs of urban and rural people for non-staple foods, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

The representatives also made full discussions on the issue of the people's livelihood. Ensure that people's lives are improved in the short term, so that commune members are in a good mood and have more enthusiasm, and ensure a greater leap forward this year.

When discussing the ten proposals put forward to the whole country, the representatives paid attention to both giving play to enthusiasm and paying attention to practical possibilities. All indicators were carefully considered. Representatives from Hebei Province believed that as long as we bring out the combination of hard work, practical work, and clever work, the tasks stipulated in the Ten Proposals for this year can definitely be completed and may be exceeded.

All the representatives expressed in the discussion that they would work hard when they return. During the meeting, many representatives sent telegrams, made phone calls, or wrote letters home to convey the spirit of the meeting in a timely manner.

    一定把人民公社办得更好
    全国农业先进单位代表纷纷表示决心
    据新华社3日讯　　出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的代表们，纷纷表示回去要大干一场。
    在全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议开会期间，代表们认真地学习了中共中央八届六中全会公报和“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”两个文件，并结合中央领导同志在会议上的几个报告，对人民公社的性质、公社的生产方针、公社的民主管理、分配和生活问题、革命热情和实事求是的作风相结合的问题，做了比较充分的讨论。
    代表们认为：学习党的八届六中全会两个文件和听了中央负责同志的几个报告，是他们参加这次会议的最大收获，不仅明确地认识了国际国内形势，对发展生产、办好人民公社的方针、政策也有了进一步的认识，并深刻地体会到人民公社化的伟大意义。正像一些代表们说的：中央的文件给我们开了窍，把开展人民公社运动的主要问题都安排了。在讨论中，代表们举出了很多事实，来肯定现在的人民公社有着比高级农业生产合作社更多的优越性。
    在会议期间代表们还交流了办好公社、整顿公社的意见。有些代表提出在今后整顿公社的几个月中要做好几件事情：首先是组织干部认真学习党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议，统一认识，提高思想，通过整顿公社搞好生产，搞好生活，搞好公社的管理和分配，合理安排国家、公社、个人的分配比例，对群众最关心的财务和生活问题要把政策交代清楚。有的代表团还提出，回去要发扬民主作风与实事求是的作风，把公社办好。
    代表们在讨论中认为，中央提出的实行工业与农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举及农林牧副渔全面发展的方针是十分正确的，代表们认为这样做不仅可以使经济建设迅速的发展，而且可以增加社员的收入，满足城乡人民副食品的需要，巩固工农联盟。
    代表们对群众生活问题也做了充分的讨论。保证在短期内把人民生活搞好，使社员心情舒畅，干劲更大，保证今年更大的跃进。
    代表们在讨论向全国提出的十大倡议的时候，既注意了发挥干劲，又注意了实际可能。对各项指标都是认真地考虑过的。河北省代表认为：只要拿出苦干、实干结合巧干，十大倡议规定的今年的任务一定可以完成而且是可能超过的。
    各代表们在讨论中都表示回去要大干一场。在会议期间就有很多代表打电报、电话或写信回家，及时传达会议的精神。
