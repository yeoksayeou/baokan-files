Today, after the square was renamed, a team of athletes brought the congratulatory letter from the residents of Iasi, the former capital of the Principality of Moldavia, to the residents of Bucharest (the former capital of the Romanian Principality). At the same time, the residents of Iasi also received a congratulatory letter from the residents of Bucharest. In this newly named square, tens of thousands of citizens braved the severe cold and watched with great interest the wonderful folk dances performed by various artistic groups. In the evening, tens of thousands of citizens spent a carnival night in "Republic Square." In the historically significant city of Iasi, citizens gathered in the square in front of the former Moldavian Prince's Palace, expressing their infinite joy with singing and dancing.
