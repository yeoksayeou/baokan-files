Xinhua News Agency reports: The 33rd National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, which opened in Naples on the 15th, closed on the 18th.

    The Socialist Party's congress was held amid serious divisions within the party over the relationship with the Italian Communist Party, resulting in a sharp struggle within the party. Three reports, not one, were submitted for discussion at the congress. These three reports were drafted by the Socialist Party's General Secretary Nenni, Secretary Viggiani, and Secretary Basso, the leaders of the three factions within the Socialist Party.

    Italian Communist Party Secretary Amendola attended the meeting on behalf of the Italian Communist Party and delivered a congratulatory speech. He said that the ideological debates and differences between the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the international workers' movement should not hinder the fraternal cooperation of the Italian people in their common struggle for freedom and socialism.

    In his report to the congress, Socialist Party General Secretary Nenni firmly opposed united action between the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. He said that this "formula" was outdated and had lost its meaning. However, he acknowledged that trade unions must act in unison. Regarding the merger of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party, he said that he considered it a question of the unity of all socialists (referring to socialists and social democrats – editor's note) around the Italian Socialist Party. The Socialist Party's policy is to oppose the "bourgeois conservative group headed by the Christian Democratic Party" politically.

    Speaking on international issues, Nenni criticized the imperialist aggression against Middle Eastern countries and criticized the United States' policy towards People's China. Nenni also stated in his report that "the occupation of Berlin has lasted for more than twelve years. This occupation should be ended sooner or later, either according to the Soviet proposal or in some other form, just as Germany must be unified sooner or later."

    Nenni advocated resolving international issues through negotiations and expressed hope for a high-level meeting.

    Socialist Party Secretary Viggiani delivered a report on behalf of the Socialist Party's left wing. He emphasized that the correctness of the left wing's view that working-class parties must act in unison has been confirmed by many events and the current domestic situation in Italy, which is characterized by the solidarity and fraternal cooperation of the working people in large-scale economic and social struggles.

    Referring to Nenni's report, Viggiani said that the left wing increasingly opposed Nenni's position. The position taken by Nenni actually isolates the Socialist Party. Viggiani said that the task of the Italian Socialist Party is to fight with all its strength against the capitalist and monopoly capitalist social system and against the bourgeois forces and their representative, the current government.

    In his report, Socialist Party Secretary Basso made many criticisms of Nenni. He said that Nenni was not clear enough in rejecting all forms of cooperation between the (Socialist Party) and the Christian Democratic Party, and that the party's independence does not preclude the struggle for the political unity of the entire working class, not just trade union unity.

    He advocated dissolving the factions within the Socialist Party based on formulating a wise political policy acceptable to the entire party.

    The congress debated the three reports of the party's three faction leaders. The Nenni faction obtained a majority at the congress, but this majority was far from what they had expected. The representatives who voted in favor of their proposed draft resolution accounted for only 58% of the total number of representatives. The votes in favor of the proposals put forward by Viggiani and Basso accounted for 32.6% and 8.7% respectively. Therefore, more than 40% disagreed with Nenni's policy. This was a setback for the Nenni faction.

    In his closing speech, Socialist Party left-wing leader Viggiani said that abandoning the political unity of the working class and only acknowledging this unity in the trade union struggle to win the immediate demands of the working people is a betrayal of Marxism. Socialist Party Central Committee member Russo also criticized Nenni, saying that the speeches of the Nenni faction representatives reflected that the views of the bourgeois camp had infiltrated the Socialist Party. If these views gained the upper hand in the party, then the Italian Socialist Party would not be a working-class party. Many other faction representatives also emphasized that Nenni's position carried the serious danger of leading the Socialist Party into the mire of reformism.

    The Italian newspaper "Unità" pointed out that the Socialist Party congress ended without reaching a consensus among the factions. The outcome of the Socialist Party congress has now attracted the attention of the Italian right-wing groups and reactionaries. Mario Zagari, Deputy Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, which participates in the Italian government, said that he would ask his party to rejoin Nenni's ranks.

### 意社会党举行代表大会  主张同共产党合作的力量增强  南尼派方针仅得微弱多数支持

    意社会党举行代表大会
    主张同共产党合作的力量增强  南尼派方针仅得微弱多数支持
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：15日在那不勒斯开幕的意大利社会党第三十三次全国代表大会，已经在18日闭幕。
    社会党这次代表大会是在党内长期来对待意大利共产党关系问题发生严重分歧，而在党内形成尖锐斗争的情况下举行的。提交大会讨论的报告不是一个，而是三个。这三个报告的起草人是社会党总书记南尼、书记维基耶蒂和书记巴索，这三个人是目前社会党内三派的领袖。
    意大利共产党书记阿门多拉代表意大利共产党参加了会议，并向代表大会致祝辞。他说，意大利共产党和社会党在国际工人运动的意识形态问题上的争论和分歧不应当阻碍意大利人民在争取自由和社会主义的共同斗争中的兄弟合作。
    社会党总书记南尼在大会上作报告时，坚决反对意大利共产党和社会党采取一致行动。他说，这个“公式”已经过时了，失去了它的意义。但是它承认工会必须行动一致。他在谈到社会党和社会民主党合并的问题时说，他认为这是一个全体社会党人（指社会党人和社会民主党人——编者）在意大利社会党周围团结的问题。社会党的政策是对政治上以“天主教民主党为首的资产阶级保守集团”采取反对立场。
    南尼在谈到国际问题时抨击了帝国主义对中东国家的侵略行动，并且批评了美国对人民中国的政策。南尼在报告中还认为，“柏林的占领已经有十二年多了。这种占领迟早应该根据苏联的建议或者根据其他形式结束，就像德国迟早要统一一样”。
    南尼主张通过谈判方式解决国际问题并且表示希望召开高级会议。
    社会党书记维基耶蒂代表社会党左派作了报告。他着重指出，左派代表关于工人阶级政党必须一致行动的看法的正确性已经为许多事件和意大利当前的国内局势所证实，国内局势的特点就是劳动人民团结友爱进行大规模的经济斗争和社会斗争。
  维基耶蒂在谈到南尼的报告时说，左派越来越反对南尼的立场。南尼所采取的立场实际上是使社会党处于孤立状态。维基耶蒂说，意大利社会党的任务是：为反对资本主义和垄断资本主义社会制度、为反对资产阶级势力及其代表——现政府而全力进行斗争。
    社会党书记巴索在他的报告中对南尼提出许多批评。他说，南尼在否定（社会党）同天主教民主党的一切形式的合作方面还不够明确，党的独立性并不排斥为争取整个工人阶级的政治团结而不只是工会团结而进行的斗争。
    他主张在制定一个全党都能够接受的明智的政治方针的基础上解散社会党内部的各个派别。
    大会对党内三派领袖的三个报告进行了辩论。南尼派在代表大会上得到多数，但是这种多数同他们所指望的相差很远，投票赞成他们提出的决议草案的代表只占代表总数的58％。而赞成维基耶蒂和巴索提出的提案的票数，分别占32.6％和8.7％。因此不同意南尼政策的占40％以上。这对南尼派是一个挫折。
    社会党左派领导人维基耶蒂在闭幕词中说，放弃工人阶级的政治一致而仅仅在争取劳动人民眼前要求的工会斗争方面承认这种一致，就是背弃马克思主义。社会党中央委员卢素也批评南尼，他说，南尼派代表的发言反映了资产阶级阵营的观点已经渗入到社会党内。如果这些观点在党内占了上风，那么意大利社会党就不是工人阶级政党了，许多其他派系代表也强调指出，南尼的立场有使社会党滚入改良主义泥坑的严重危险。
    意大利“团结报”指出，这次社会党代表大会是在各派之间没有取得一致的情况下结束的。现在社会党大会的结果已引起意大利右翼集团和反动派的注意。参加意大利政府的社会民主党副书记马里奥·查加里说，他将要求他的党重新加入南尼的队伍。
