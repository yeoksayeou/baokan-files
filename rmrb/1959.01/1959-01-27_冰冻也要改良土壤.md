    Even Frozen, Soil Must Be Improved
    In Huinong County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, an army for improving the soil has been organized and is currently engaged in deep plowing to transform saline-alkali soil.
    This soil improvement work is extremely arduous, requiring deep plowing under conditions where the ground is frozen a foot deep, followed by fertilization in five or six layers. The farmers have come up with various ways to break the ice and thaw the ground, such as spreading grass on the ice and burning it to melt the ice, or using the heat from horse manure to melt the frozen ground before plowing.

    冰冻也要改良土壤
    宁夏回族自治区惠农县组织了一支改良土壤大军，正在深翻改造盐碱土壤。
    这项土壤改良工作十分艰巨，需要在地冻一尺的条件下进行深翻，然后分五、六层施肥。农民们想出了多种破冰解冻办法，如在冰上铺草燃火熔冰，或用马粪热来熔冰冻再翻土地。
