Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 19th – The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party held a plenary session on the 17th and 18th. The meeting passed a resolution supporting the Congolese people and demanding that the government grant Congo independence.

The resolution pointed out that the events in Leopoldville were entirely the responsibility of Belgian colonialism.

The Central Committee plenary session believes that the Belgian government's statement on Congo policy on January 13th was as elusive as a shadow. Its purpose is to use a superficial spirit of magnanimity to conceal the continued colonial exploitation of Congo.

The plenary session pointed out that the government, for the benefit of a handful of financiers, deliberately endangered the safety and lives of Belgian workers in Congo. The Belgian government has mobilized troops, making it possible for Congo to become a second Algeria and dragging the entire country into a colonial war. This war will shed the blood of Belgian youth, inflate military budgets, and further worsen the economic situation of the working people.

The plenary session called on all democrats in the country to demand that the government establish normal and friendly relations with Congo, and to demand that the two countries hold negotiations in order to grant Congo independence.

The plenary session proposed to take urgent measures: end the suppression of the Congolese people, immediately release the arrested Congolese leaders; immediately grant Congolese workers freedom of association, publication and assembly in accordance with the United Nations Charter; and withdraw the Belgian troops in Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, January 19th – According to TASS, Brussels, January 18th: Van Moerkerke, secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, published an article in the "Red Flag Weekly" on the 18th analyzing the situation in Congo. He called on the Belgian workers' movement and all democrats to promote the Congolese people's attainment of independence, to promote the immediate granting of political freedom, and to demand the release of Congolese leaders and the cessation of criminal suppression.

Van Moerkerke pointed out that the Belgian government's statement on Congo's reforms is nothing more than applying a new coat of paint to colonialism; its colonialist essence does not change as a result.

Van Moerkerke questioned: If the basic conditions for conducting truly free elections—freedom of speech and freedom of publication—are not guaranteed, can the government's statement on holding elections be believed? He specifically criticized the Belgian colonialists for arresting the most prestigious Congolese leaders and dissolving ABAKO, the largest Congolese organization.

    比共支持刚果人民独立愿望
    要求政府停止武装镇压　指责政府欺骗性声明
    新华社巴黎19日电　比利时共产党中央委员会17日、18日举行了全体会议。会上通过决议声援刚果人民，要求政府让刚果独立。
    决议指出，利奥波德维尔事件完全应当由比利时殖民主义负责。
    中央全会认为，比利时政府1月13日关于对刚果政策的声明的措词像影子一样难于捉摸。它的目的是想用表面的宽大精神来掩盖继续对刚果实行的殖民剥削。
    全会指出，政府为了一小撮金融家的利益，故意使在刚果的比利时劳动者的安全和生活遭到威胁。比利时政府动用了军队，因而有可能使刚果成为第二个阿尔及利亚而把全国卷入一场殖民战争。这场战争将使比利时的青年流血，将使军事预算膨胀，并将使劳动人民的经济情况进一步恶化。
    全会号召全国一切民主分子要求政府和刚果建立正常的友好关系，并且要求两国举行谈判，以便给刚果以独立。
    全会提出要采取紧急措施：结束对刚果人民的镇压，立即释放被逮捕的刚果领袖；根据联合国宪章立即赋予刚果劳动者以工会、出版和结社自由；调回在刚果的比利时军队。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔18日讯：比利时共产党中央委员会书记范穆克尔克18日在“红旗报周刊”上撰文分析刚果的局势。他号召比利时工人运动和所有民主人士应促使刚果人民获得独立，促使立即给予政治自由，并且要求释放刚果人领袖和停止罪恶镇压。
    范穆克尔克指出，比利时政府关于刚果改革的声明不过是给殖民主义涂上一层新的色彩，它的殖民主义本质并不因此而改变。
    范穆克尔克质问道：如果对于进行真正自由选举的基本条件——言论自由和出版自由没有得到保证的话，政府的关于进行选举的声明，能令人信以为真吗？他特别指责了比利时殖民主义者逮捕刚果人最有声望的领袖和解散最大的刚果人组织阿巴科。
