Vietnam-Laos Border Incident Should Be Resolved Peacefully
Commentator of this newspaper

Recently, the relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos have become strained due to Laos' unfounded claims to certain border territories of Vietnam. This situation cannot but arouse the attention and concern of all those who care about peace in Indochina and the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.

The simple course of the Vietnam-Laos border incident is as follows: In recent months, the army and air force of the Kingdom of Laos have repeatedly violated the territory and airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Although the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly reminded the government of the Kingdom of Laos of this situation and demanded that measures be taken to stop such incidents, this situation has not improved until now, and the violations continue to occur.

The Vietnam-Laos border incident itself is not very complicated. Originally, as long as the countries concerned could treat each other with trust and goodwill, such problems could be completely resolved through peaceful consultation on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity. A particularly important factor that is currently conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Vietnam-Laos border issue is that throughout the entire process of this incident, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently implemented the spirit of friendly consultation and strived to peacefully resolve the border disputes between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect. After the incident occurred, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the one hand, sternly pointed out that the actions of the Lao army in invading the Vietnamese border endangered the normal life of the people in the border area and were detrimental to the good-neighborly relations between the two countries, and hoped that the government of the Kingdom of Laos would take measures to stop such behavior; on the other hand, he sincerely suggested that Laos and Vietnam send government representatives to Vientiane or Hanoi for negotiations to resolve the current border dispute between the two countries. Although the government of the Kingdom of Laos adopted a cold and even unreasonably rejected attitude towards the reasonable proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and although some extreme pro-American elements in Laos fabricated and distorted the truth of the incident in order to create tension between the two countries, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always patiently reiterated its proposals, hoping that the good-neighborly relations between the two countries can be maintained, and that the disputes between the two countries can be resolved peacefully. The tolerant attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully demonstrates its loyalty to its peaceful and friendly foreign policy, to the principles of peaceful coexistence of the Bandung Conference, and to the implementation of the principles jointly announced by it and the government of the Kingdom of Laos. Everyone remembers that the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos formally stated at the Asian-African Conference held in 1955 that the two governments were willing to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to establish good neighborly relations between the two countries. In the joint communiqué issued by the two governments on August 29, 1956, this point was reaffirmed, and it was emphasized that the existing problems between the two countries should be resolved fairly and correctly through consultation on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

The position taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this border incident is not only conducive to the neighborly relations between the two countries and the traditional friendship between the Vietnamese and Lao peoples, but also helps to ease the situation in the region. The Chinese people express their full support.

It is regrettable that although the government of the Kingdom of Laos has verbally stated that it hopes that the current incident will not harm the good-neighborly relations between Laos and Vietnam, it has never taken any corresponding actions. What is particularly disturbing is that the extreme pro-American elements in Laos even disregard the responsibilities of the Kingdom of Laos for the Geneva Accords, and openly stated that Laos is within the "defense" area of ​​the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and requested the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene "when necessary."

The conspiracy of US imperialism is obvious in this incident. At the beginning of the Vietnam-Laos border incident, the American propaganda machine vigorously publicized that this incident "threatened" the stability of Southeast Asia, and advocated that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization take action. The intention of the United States is not difficult to understand. One of the most vicious means by which colonialists used to rule the people of Indochina in the past was to create divisions and antagonisms among them in order to defeat them one by one. Today, they are still creating conflicts between many countries in Asia and Africa in order to provide an excuse for their intervention. Isn't it under the guise of "aid" and "defense" that US imperialists have repeatedly extended their aggressive claws into some Southeast Asian countries?

China is a common neighbor of Vietnam and Laos. We cannot but express our concern about the current situation, and sincerely hope that the government of the Kingdom of Laos, valuing the friendly relations of the Indochinese people and the peace of the Indochinese region, can work with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolve the disputes over the border issue through peaceful consultation in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence of the Asian-African Conference.

    越南——老挝边境事件应该和平解决
    本报评论员
    最近，越南民主共和国和老挝王国之间的关系，由于老挝对越南的某些边疆领土提出了没有根据的要求而变得紧张起来。这种情况，不能不引起一切关心印度支那和平、关心日内瓦协议的全部实施的人们的注意和关切。
    越南—老挝边境事件的简单经过是这样的：近几个月来，老挝王国的陆军和空军曾经许多次侵犯越南民主共和国的领土和领空。越南民主共和国政府虽然多次提醒老挝王国政府注意这一情况，并且要求采取措施制止这类事件的发生，但是，直到现在，这种情况并未改善，侵犯事件仍然继续发生。
    就越南—老挝边境事件本身来说，并不十分复杂。本来只要有关的国家能够以信任和善意相待，这类问题是完全有可能在互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则基础上，通过和平协商来得到解决的。而目前有助于和平解决越南—老挝边界问题的一个特别重要的因素，就是在这次事件发生的整个过程中，越南民主共和国始终贯彻友好协商的精神，争取在平等和相互尊重的基础上和平解决两国的边界争端。越南民主共和国总理范文同当事件发生后，一方面严正指出老挝军队侵犯越南边境的行动危害了边界地区人民的正常生活，有害于两国之间的睦邻关系，希望老挝王国政府采取措施，制止这种行为；一方面诚恳地建议老挝和越南双方互派政府代表在万象或河内进行谈判，来解决目前两国边境问题的争端。尽管老挝王国政府对于越南民主共和国的合理建议，采取了冷淡甚至无理拒绝的态度，尽管老挝的某些极端亲美分子为了制造两国之间的紧张局势，对事件真相进行捏造和歪曲，但越南民主共和国却始终耐心地一再提出自己的建议，希望两国之间的睦邻关系得以保持，希望两国之间的争端能以和平方式求得解决。越南民主共和国政府这种宽容态度，充分说明它忠于自己的和平友好的外交政策，忠于万隆会议的和平共处的原则，忠于实行它和老挝王国政府所共同宣布的原则。大家记得，越南民主共和国政府和老挝王国政府，早在1955年召开的亚非会议上，就曾正式表示两国政府愿意遵行和平共处五项原则来建立两国之间良好的邻国关系。而在1956年8月29日两国政府发表的联合公报中，再一次肯定了这一点，并且强调两国之间所存在的问题，应在互相尊重主权、领土完整和互不干涉内政的基础上，通过协商方法，进行公平和正确的解决。
    越南民主共和国政府对这次边境事件所采取的立场，不仅有利于两国之间的邻邦关系和越老两民族之间传统的友谊，也有助于这一地区形势的缓和。中国人民表示完全的支持。
    令人遗憾的是，老挝王国政府虽然口头上表示希望目前的事件不会危害老挝—越南之间的善邻关系，但始终不曾做出任何相应的行动。尤其令人不安的是，老挝极端亲美分子甚至无视老挝王国对于日内瓦协议负有的责任，公然表示老挝处在东南亚条约侵略组织的“防御”地区之内，“必要时”要求东南亚条约侵略组织进行干涉。
    这一事件同美帝国主义的阴谋策划是显而易见的。美国的宣传机关在越南—老挝边境事件发生之初，就大事宣扬这一事件“威胁”东南亚的稳定，鼓吹东南亚条约侵略组织采取行动。美国的用心是不难理解的。殖民主义者过去统治印度支那各国人民的最恶毒的手段之一，就是在他们之间制造隔阂和对立，以利于各个击破。今天他们也仍然在亚非地区的许多国家之间制造冲突，以便为他们进行干涉提供借口。美帝国主义者不正是在“援助”和“防御”的名义下，曾多次把它的侵略魔手伸进东南亚一些国家吗？
    中国是越南和老挝的共同的邻邦。我们对于目前的情况不能不表示关切，并且诚恳地希望老挝王国政府，能够以印度支那人民的友好关系为贵，以印度支那地区的和平为贵，根据亚非会议的和平共处的原则，同越南民主共和国政府一道，通过和平协商来解决关于边界问题的争端。
