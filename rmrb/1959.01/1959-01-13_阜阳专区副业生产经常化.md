Hefei, January 12th (By our reporter) Sideline production in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, has been institutionalized.

In developing sideline production, Fuyang Prefecture has adopted the method of focusing on the breeding industry, with pig raising as the backbone, implementing a combination of public and private breeding, with collective breeding as the mainstay. Sideline production in the entire region has developed rapidly. In the past eleven months, the average net income from sideline occupations was more than seventy yuan per person, completing 111% of the plan, nearly doubling the same period in 1957. Due to the development of the breeding industry, it has greatly supported the needs of industrial and mining cities and national exports. Fuyang Prefecture has completed 118% of the state's assigned task for the sale of fattened pigs, and 530,000 fattened pigs have been transferred out of the area, an increase of 8.8% over the same period in 1957. The purchase of eggs has completed 120% of the state plan.

After the people's communes were established, Fuyang Prefecture adopted the method of establishing livestock farms at three levels: commune, production brigade, and production team. Great efforts were made to develop collective sidelines, and specialized teams for sideline production were established, with dedicated personnel responsible at each level. While vigorously developing steel production and grain production, sideline occupations were never squeezed out because labor was properly arranged.

The vigorous development of sideline production has not only increased the income of commune members but also expanded the accumulation of the communes. According to incomplete statistics for the entire region, more than 23,000 factories have been established using sideline income, 9.7 million jin of chemical fertilizers have been purchased, more than 1.4 million pieces of large and small farm implements have been purchased, more than 6,000 head of draft animals have been purchased, and more than 800,000 sets of boiler-camel machines, water pumps, and water lifting tools have been purchased. The masses have also used sideline income to purchase a large number of daily necessities.

    阜阳专区副业生产经常化
    本报合肥12日电　安徽阜阳专区副业生产已做到经常化。
    阜阳专区在发展副业生产上，采取了以饲养业为重点，以养猪为骨干的办法，实行公养和私养结合，而又以集体饲养为主，全区副业生产得到迅速发展，去年十一个月当中，副业的纯收益每人平均达七十元多，完成计划111％，比1957年同期增加近一倍。由于饲养业的发展，大大支援了工矿城市和国家出口的需要。阜阳专区肥猪交售已完成国家分配任务118％，外调肥猪五十三万头，较1957年同期增加8.8％，鸡蛋收购完成国家计划120％。
    人民公社化以后，阜阳专区采取了社、生产大队、生产小队三级建立养畜场办法，大抓集体副业，并建立了副业生产专业队，逐级确定专人负责。在大办钢铁、大抓粮食生产的同时，因为劳动力有了适当安排，始终没有把副业挤掉。
    副业生产的大力发展，不仅增加了社员的收入，而且也扩大了公社的积累。全区据不完全统计，用副业收益开办的工厂二万三千多个，购买化肥九百七十万斤，大小农具一百四十万多件，耕畜六千多头，锅驼机、抽水机、提水工具八十万多部。群众也用副业收入购买了大量生活用品。
