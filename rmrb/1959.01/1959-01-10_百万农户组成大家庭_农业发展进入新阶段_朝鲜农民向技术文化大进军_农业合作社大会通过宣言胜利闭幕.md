Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th - The National Agricultural Cooperative Congress of Korea concluded victoriously at 7 pm tonight after a five-day meeting in Pyongyang.

The meeting today adopted the Congress Declaration, the Standard Charter of Agricultural Cooperatives, and a letter to South Korean farmers. Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a concluding speech at today's meeting.

The declaration adopted by the Congress stated that this historic Congress summarized the achievements of the Korean agricultural cooperativization movement, discussed the fighting tasks for further developing agriculture, and fully demonstrated the correctness and infinite vitality of the Korean Workers' Party's general line for post-war economic construction and agricultural cooperativization policy.

The declaration said that great changes have taken place in the Korean countryside in the five years since the war. The individual peasant economy of thousands of years has been abolished forever. One million farm households have gathered in more than 3,800 agricultural cooperatives, forming a large family. The Korean countryside has become a cooperative socialist countryside.

The declaration said that the grain output in northern Korea in 1958 had reached 3.7 million tons, and the most difficult food problem in Korea after the war has been solved. This has promoted the production of agricultural products and the development of various agricultural sectors, and can more satisfactorily supply industrial raw materials.

The declaration said that agriculture in northern Korea has entered a new stage of development. Korean farmers must ride the Chollima and accelerate the realization of the great tasks of further developing agriculture proposed by Comrade Kim Il-sung. This is to increase the output of important agricultural products to the following levels within two to three years: 7 million tons of grain, 200,000 tons of cotton, 400,000 tons of meat, 70,000 tons of silkworm cocoons, and more than 250,000 tons of fruits. That is to say, to double grain production, triple cotton production, increase meat production by 3.4 times, increase silkworm cocoon production by 7 times, and double fruit production.

The declaration said that the most urgent problem in the agricultural sector at present is to complete the technical revolution in the shortest possible time. The central task is to realize water conservancy within two to three years, electrification within one to two years, and mechanization within four to five years.

The declaration emphasized the need to carry out communist education among farmers and to carry out sports, literature, and art activities.

Park Jung-ai, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting this morning on the second item on the agenda of the conference - the draft Standard Charter of Agricultural Cooperatives (provisional). Park Jung-ai said that with the victorious completion of agricultural cooperativization in Korea, agriculture has entered a new stage of development. In order to consolidate agricultural cooperatives politically and economically, it is necessary to formulate a new Standard Charter of Agricultural Cooperatives. Park Jung-ai said: The draft charter stipulates that the purpose of agricultural cooperatives is: to promote the completion of socialist construction in the countryside and gradually prepare for the construction of a communist society. She said that the entire draft charter is permeated with the spirit of: expanding and strengthening the collective ownership of agricultural cooperatives' land and all other means of production, developing agricultural production more rapidly on a new technical basis, enabling members to live a prosperous life, and consolidating the socialist positions in the countryside.

During the meeting, a total of 269 representatives spoke, and they unanimously supported the reports made by Kim Il-sung and Park Jung-ai on the first and second items on the agenda of the conference.

The letter to South Korean farmers adopted by the Congress called on South Korean farmers to bravely fight against US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, resolutely demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a concluding speech amidst warm applause and cheers from all the representatives. He said that this conference showed the unanimous support and endorsement of the entire peasantry for the policies of the Labor Party, and showed how much the entire Korean people love the Korean Labor Party. Kim Il-sung called on all representatives and all farmers to overcome all difficulties, to struggle for the implementation of the agricultural development policies formulated by the conference, and for the realization of the technical revolution and cultural revolution in the countryside.

Kim Il-sung emphasized the need to vigorously develop animal husbandry and develop diversified economies to improve the living standards of farmers.

Kim Il-sung called on the leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives to strengthen their sense of responsibility, go deep among the masses, work with the masses, highly promote democracy, learn advanced science, and do their work well.

Kim Il-sung called on all farmers to continue to go all out, to leap forward again and again, to build a socialist paradise in northern Korea, and to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

At today's meeting, the heads of the agricultural delegations from the German Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia delivered congratulatory speeches to the Congress.
