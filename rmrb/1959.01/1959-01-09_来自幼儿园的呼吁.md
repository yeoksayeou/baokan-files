An Appeal from Kindergarten

Dear Editor:

Recently, we often encounter this situation: whenever we finish telling the children a story, they always look up with their small faces, their eyes full of longing, and plead, "Auntie, tell another story, please!" "Good Auntie, tell a new one, not an old one." Even when it's time for outdoor activities, they linger indoors, unwilling to go out, just to hear another story. This makes us both touched and troubled. Three to five-year-old children love to hear stories, and they want fresh ones. This is a manifestation of their developing intelligence and strong desire for knowledge. But we rack our brains and cannot create so many stories. We have to turn to newspapers, magazines, and books for help, but they rarely publish stories suitable for kindergarten teachers to tell children. Many responsible aunties have the same distress. Especially the childcare workers in the countryside, who are new to this profession, are even more distressed due to the limitations of their work experience and cultural level. We hope that writers, especially our familiar and respected children's literature writers, will write some short, pleasant stories with realistic educational significance for the sake of the children!

The Entirety of Beijing Donghuamen Kindergarten Teachers

[Editor's Note] We feel that the letter from all the teachers of Beijing Donghuamen Kindergarten is not only addressed to the editorial department, nor is it only addressed to the writers. It is everyone's responsibility to tell kindergarten children more stories. We hope everyone will care about the spiritual life of the next generation!

### 来自幼儿园的呼吁

    来自幼儿园的呼吁亲爱的编辑同志：
    我们近来常常遇到这样的情景：每当给孩子们讲完一个故事，他们总会仰起小脸蛋，充满渴望的神色央求道：“阿姨，再讲一个故事好吗？”“好姨，讲一个新的，不要老的。”尽管到了室外活动的时刻，可是他们都逗留在屋里不肯出去，为的是再听一个故事。使我们又感动又为难。三、五岁的孩子，爱听故事，而且要新鲜的，这是智力正在发育、求知欲旺盛的表现。但是我们挖空心思，也编造不了那么多的故事。我们不得不求助于报纸、杂志、书籍，可是它们很少登载适合幼儿园老师们讲给孩子听的故事。许多责任心强的阿姨都有同样的苦恼。特别是农村的保育工作者，她们新参加到我们这行列里来，受到工作经验和文化水平的限制，这种苦恼更大。我们希望作家们，特别是我们熟悉的敬爱的儿童文学作家们，为了孩子，快给我们写些短小动听有现实教育意义的故事吧！
                            北京东华门幼儿园全体教师
    〔编者附记〕我们觉得，北京东华门幼儿园全体教师们的来信，不仅是写给编辑部的，也不仅是写给作家们的。给幼儿园小朋友多讲些故事，是我们大家的责任。我们希望大家都来关心下一代的精神生活吧！
