The Era's Spirit in Traditional Chinese Painting

After seeing the "Jiangsu Province Traditional Chinese Painting Exhibition," one gets a new feeling. Most of the hundreds of works on display depict modern themes and are full of the spirit of the times.

The large-scale traditional Chinese painting "Fighting for Steel" and "People's Commune Canteen," collectively created by the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Painting, uses traditional techniques to depict the new atmosphere of our nationwide Great Leap Forward. The scenes are fiery and enthusiastic. Even in some small, individual pieces, mass movements such as steelmaking, eliminating the four pests, and splitting mountains to divert water are all themes favored by the painters. For example, some new subjects that painters had never attempted before appeared at this exhibition, such as "Forgeman," "Foundry Worker," "Coking Plant," "Local Blast Furnace Iron Smelting," and "Steel Tapping." Although some of these works still appear thin and immature, and the forms are not diverse enough, the spirit of the traditional Chinese painters' effort to express the current struggle is commendable.

In front of these many paintings depicting people, labor, and the great construction of the motherland, the old view that traditional Chinese painting cannot reflect real life is completely refuted.

Traditional Chinese painters have proven with their practice that traditional Chinese painting can reflect real life and can be combined with it naturally. For example, in a painting called "Ode to Yuhuatai," the painter did not simply depict the landscape of Yuhuatai, nor did he make other rigid combinations. From the picture, the Martyrs' Memorial only occupies a small corner, and half of it is obscured by trees. Young Pioneers faintly appear in the bushes. However, the author also used full strokes to paint the vigorous, towering pines and cypresses, and under the trees, faintly reveals a scene of smoking chimneys at the foot of Yuhuatai... which is very inspiring. In addition, works such as "Unstoppable Wind and Snow" and "Transporting Materials," if the authors did not first have a passion for new things, it would be difficult to paint such paintings; if they had not used the tradition of traditional Chinese painting and taken into account the aesthetic habits of the masses, it would be difficult to combine them so naturally.

The achievements of Jiangsu's traditional Chinese painters are gratifying. This is the result of the painters facing life.

    国画里的时代气息
    看了“江苏省国画展览会”以后，给人以一种新的感觉，在这上百幅的作品里大都是表现现代主题的，充满着时代气息。
    江苏省国画院集体创作的大幅国画“为钢铁而战”、“人民公社食堂”用传统的技法描绘了我们全民大跃进的新气象，画面是火炽的、热烈的，就是一些独幅的小品里，炼钢铁、除四害、劈山引水等群众运动也都是画家们喜爱的题材。例如这次会上就出现了一些画家们以往从未有过的新命题，像“锻工”、“翻砂”、“炼焦场”、“土高炉炼铁”、“出钢”等都是。这些作品虽然有的还显得比较单薄，不够成熟，形式也不够多样，但是国画家们这种努力想表现当前斗争的精神是可贵的。
    在这许多表现人，表现劳动，表现祖国伟大建设的画幅面前，那种认为传统的国画是不能反映现实生活的老看法都不攻自破了。
    国画家用自己的实践证明，国画既可反映现实生活，而且可以结合得很自然。例如有一幅“雨花台颂”，这位画家就没有单纯的只是去描写雨花台的山水草木，也没有作其他生硬的结合。从画面上看，烈士纪念碑只占了一个不大的角落，而且半截被树木遮掩，树丛中隐隐地出现了来过队日的少先队员。但是，作者也用了饱满的笔墨画出了苍劲遮天的松柏树，树下又淡淡地显出雨花台下一片冒烟的烟筒……很能启发人联想。此外像“风雪无阻”、“运料”等作品，如果作者们不是先有了对新事物的激情是很难画出这样的画来；如果不是运用了国画传统和照顾到群众的欣赏习惯，也是很难结合得这样自然的。
    江苏国画家们的成绩是可喜的，这是画家们面向生活的成果。
