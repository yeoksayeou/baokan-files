A Year of Great Development in National Independence Movements
Xing Zhang

    1958 was a year in which international peace forces, socialist revolutionary forces, and national revolutionary forces achieved significant development, and imperialist and reactionary forces were further weakened. In this year, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rose comprehensively, powerfully打击了以美国为首的帝国主义集团的军事侵略和其他阴谋活动, and accelerated the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system.

    Socialist and national revolutionary forces are new forces that are rising and developing; imperialism is a decadent force facing serious political and economic crises.

    Sharp Struggles, Great Victories

    Under unprecedentedly favorable international circumstances, national independence movements experienced sharp struggles and achieved great victories.

    National independence movements are expanding from the Far East and the Middle East to Africa and Latin America, with irresistible vigor. The Middle East became the most intense area of ​​anti-colonialist struggle. The victory of the Iraqi people's revolution is of particular significance. It overthrew the Faisal-Said traitorous regime and disrupted the imperialist aggression front in the Middle East. US-British imperialism launched a frantic counterattack, attempting to strangle the Iraqi revolution and suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East. However, the US-British invasion failed shamefully. The Republic of Iraq was defended, and the Lebanese people ousted Chamoun from power. This is another major victory for the Arab people after the Suez incident and the Syrian incident. At the same time, the people in the Oman and Aden regions of the Arabian Peninsula continued their struggle against British aggression.

    The African struggle for independence and freedom shone brightly. The heroic Algerian people's armed struggle against the French colonial army entered a new stage, and an independent Algerian Provisional Government was established. Guinea also gained independence. De Gaulle's dictatorial government's arrogant plan to merge French African colonies suffered a heavy blow. The people of French West Africa and many other French African colonies are by no means satisfied with being republics within the French Community; they demand complete independence. The rule of old colonial countries such as Britain, Italy, and Belgium in Africa has also been shaken. The people of Nigeria, Togo, Cameroon, and Somaliland have successively demanded independence before 1960. The African continent is on the eve of a great transformation.

    The development of the national independence movement in Latin America is prominently reflected in the progress of the anti-dictatorial and anti-American struggle. The Venezuelan people overthrew at one stroke the dictatorial regime that US imperialism had fostered for ten years, and successively crushed the US-orchestrated subversion plots in July, September, and November. The Batista dictatorial regime in Cuba also collapsed under the successive victorious offensives of the Cuban rebel army. At present, only two military dictatorial countries remain in Latin America: the Dominican Republic and Paraguay. US imperialism has become the center of hatred for the Latin American people. Nixon's beating vividly proves this point. The raging flames of national revolution are burning in America's "backyard."

    Striving for Economic Independence and Opposing Foreign Plunder

    While striving for independence and freedom, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have launched a struggle to get rid of the plunder of foreign monopoly capital and strive for the independent development of their national economies.

    After gaining political independence, developing their own national economies became a major and urgent task for the vast number of nationally independent countries. Imperialism tried its best to maintain its economic monopoly position in these countries and continued to carry out economic penetration, stepping up the scramble for commodity markets and spheres of influence. The economic offensive launched by US imperialism in this regard poses the greatest threat to economically underdeveloped countries. The US economic crisis that began in the autumn of 1957 and its behavior of shifting the economic crisis caused serious economic disasters to economically underdeveloped countries.

    On the one hand, the United States deliberately lowered raw material import prices and reduced and restricted raw material commodity import quotas; on the other hand, it tried its best to raise the prices of industrial products that economically underdeveloped countries needed to import, and used methods such as loans and aid to disguise the export of surplus commodities and massively dump surplus agricultural products. This two-pronged economic plunder caused economically underdeveloped countries to experience a sharp increase in trade deficits and a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves. The economic difficulties of the Philippines and Pakistan have become even more serious. As of November 21, 1958, the Philippines had a deficit of more than 104 million pesos (Philippine currency), and the national debt in 1959 would reach 1.571 billion pesos, with a deficit of 486 million pesos. Pakistan's budget deficit for the 1958 fiscal year increased by 50% compared to the previous year. US restrictions on oil imports forced Venezuela to reduce oil extraction by 14%, with a loss of at least US$250,000 per day; restrictions on lead and zinc imports reduced Bolivia's lead and zinc sales by 40%, causing Peru to lose US$20 million annually.

    Under these circumstances, the contradictions between US imperialism and economically underdeveloped countries have greatly increased. At the Colombo Plan meeting and the Americas "Committee of Twenty-One" meeting, representatives from many countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America expressed dissatisfaction with the US's foreign economic policy and demanded that the United States stabilize raw material prices and provide them with effective assistance to overcome the current economic difficulties. However, the United States is truly interested in how to make every effort to use these countries' economic difficulties to expand commodity dumping and capital exports, and strengthen its political and economic control over them.

    However, the era of imperialism arbitrarily enslaving and exploiting is gone forever. Their struggle to get rid of imperialist plunder, promote equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation, and develop national economies is developing. The "Resolution on Economic Issues" adopted by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the Asian-African Economic Conference convened based on the conference's recommendations on the establishment of an Asian-African economic cooperation organization, and the calls for developing national economies at the African Independent States Conference and the All-African People's Conference, all reflect the strong desire of the Asian and African people to strengthen economic cooperation and strive for the independent development of their national economies.

    The Most Vicious Enemy - US Imperialism

    In this year's sharp struggle against colonialism and defending national independence, it was thoroughly exposed that US imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the national independence movement, and at the same time, it is a paper tiger.

    US imperialism has been trying to hide its true colors and, through various hypocritical and cunning means, disguise itself as a friend of the national independence movement. During the Anglo-French-Israeli war of aggression against Egypt, it even appeared as an active supporter of the ceasefire, seeking political capital for its promotion of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." However, when the Iraqi revolution broke out, the US mask was immediately torn off, and it engaged in naked military aggression, regardless of any disguise, and was tried as a defendant of aggression at the emergency special session of the UN General Assembly. One of the major political significances of the Middle East events lies in the fact that the US's open aggression has opened the eyes of the Arab people and the entire Asian, African, and Latin American people, exposed the true colors of US imperialism, and experienced that US imperialism can also be defeated as long as resolute struggle is carried out.

    However, US imperialism is not reconciled to failure. Its aggression in the Middle East is shifting to a vicious offensive of threats, inducements, division, and instigation. It is "making up" for the Baghdad Pact, piecing together the "Northern Tier Alliance," negotiating with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan to conclude military agreements, and instigating Israel to carry out threatening activities. At the same time, it is making every effort to carry out conspiracies to subvert the Republic of Iraq and provoke relations between Arab countries. Recently, the successive "visits" to the Middle East by US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, Secretary of Defense McElroy, and Assistant Secretary of State Rountree were for this despicable purpose.

    In other regions, US imperialism is also stepping up its conspiracies to suppress national independence movements. After the US failed to use the Indonesian rebel group to carry out subversive activities, it continued to support the remnants of the rebel group in establishing the so-called "Sumatra State" and plotted for the Netherlands and Australia to establish the so-called "Irian State" in order to obstruct Indonesia's recovery of West Irian. The United States is expanding in Africa, squeezing out old colonial forces, and undermining the African national independence movement. In the Latin American region, the United States has repeatedly carried out subversive activities against countries such as Venezuela, which have overthrown the dictatorial regimes of US imperialism's agents, and has even openly attempted to extinguish the armed uprising of the Cuban people through armed intervention. The successive "visits" to Latin America by Nixon, Dulles, and Milton Eisenhower show how eager the US ruling group is to plot conspiracies to suppress the Latin American national independence movement.

    When US imperialism viciously suppresses national independence movements, it always waves the tattered banner of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, desperately slandering the socialist camp's sincere support for national independence movements, and provoking the friendly relations between nationally independent countries and socialist countries. This is because the facts are increasingly and powerfully proving that the support given by the Soviet Union and all socialist countries to the national independence movement in various aspects, and their cooperation in the struggle against aggression and for the defense of peace, has become a serious obstacle to the imperialists' frantic struggle to maintain the colonial system.

    The Most Loyal Friend of National Independence Movements

    From the days when there was only one socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, to the powerful development of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union today, socialist countries have consistently adopted a clear proletarian internationalist stance, regarding their support for all anti-colonialist struggles as their inescapable duty.

    In recent years, when the ominous clouds of imperialist aggressive wars shrouded Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, it was the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union that repeatedly gave the greatest support to the Arab people and stopped the bloody hands of the aggressors. This joint US-British aggression in the Middle East was a particularly vicious attack on the national independence movement and world peace. However, with the firm support of the more than 900 million people of the socialist countries and the peace-loving people of the world, the Arab people finally drove the US-British aggressors out of the Middle East. This once again vividly shows that the socialist and national revolutionary forces are greater than the imperialist forces, and the union of the former is unmatched by imperialism.

    In this year, the Indonesian people in their struggle to crush the US-backed military rebellion, the Algerian people in their armed struggle against the French colonial war, and the people of Oman and Yemen in their struggle against British aggression, have all received the support of socialist countries. At the United Nations and other international conferences, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have continuously exposed and criticized the imperialist conspiracies of aggression and interference, supported Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian, the Cypriot people's demand for self-determination, and resolutely defended the interests of all oppressed and invaded nations.

    In order to help all countries that have achieved national independence develop their own economies, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have provided economic and technical assistance without any conditions attached. The economic ties and economic cooperation between nationally independent countries and socialist countries are also conducive to the development of the economies of nationally independent countries. This stands in sharp contrast to the United States' so-called "aid" and "cooperation" and the policies of imperialist countries that exploit the difficulties of economically underdeveloped countries to strengthen their plunder.

    When the United States imposed an economic blockade on Egypt, Syria, and other Arab countries that insisted on national independence, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries helped them break through the blockade. When the United Arab Republic requested foreign aid to build the Aswan Dam, and the United States, together with Britain and the World Bank, imposed various harsh conditions for loans to the Egyptian government, and then revoked the loans in an insulting manner, the Soviet Union provided the UAR with a loan of 400 million rubles and signed an agreement with the UAR to assist in the first phase of the dam project. When imperialist countries tried every means to obstruct the development of national industries in underdeveloped countries, making it difficult for them to import machinery and equipment, and dumped surplus agricultural products and consumer goods on them, seriously damaging their national economies, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries made many proposals and plans at the United Nations and other international conferences to help economically underdeveloped countries develop their economies, and provided assistance and exported machinery and equipment according to the needs and requirements of underdeveloped countries. For example, the United States refused to give the Argentine government government investment, making it impossible for Argentina to purchase the machinery and equipment necessary to develop its oil industry, and vigorously encouraged private investment in order to infiltrate and plunder Argentina's oil resources; while the Soviet Union provided Argentina with a loan of 400 million rubles for Argentina to purchase the machinery and equipment necessary to develop its oil industry. Precisely because of this, trade and economic exchanges between socialist countries and countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also greatly developed.

    The socialist countries' selfless assistance to underdeveloped countries and the mutual development of economic cooperation have broken the "monopoly" position of imperialism, first and foremost US imperialism, in "aiding" underdeveloped countries, and have made more and more people see through the ugly face of imperialist countries who use "aid" as a guise to carry out plunder, and recognize that socialist countries are supporters of their national economic development. Even Brazilian President Kubitschek, who had great illusions about US "aid" and investment, compared the foreign economic policies of the United States and the Soviet Union in a public speech, pointing out the favorable nature of the Soviet Union's economic assistance to underdeveloped countries. At the Americas "Committee of Twenty-One" meeting, Brazilian representative Schmidt vehemently criticized US policy, believing that expanding trade with the Soviet Union and China would save Brazil from economic exhaustion. Many Latin American politicians have called for developing trade and economic relations with socialist countries.

    Strengthening Solidarity and Moving Towards Greater Victory

    In the struggle against imperialism and for national independence, the solidarity of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is constantly strengthening. This is an important factor in the strong development of the national independence movement.

    The "Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference" held from December 26, 1957 to January 1, 1958 was a milestone in the solidarity of the Asian and African people against imperialism and colonialism. This was a meeting of historical significance. Representatives of Asian and African countries powerfully exposed the crimes of the colonial system at the conference, angrily condemned imperialist aggression in the Asian and African regions, and gave strong support to the struggles of the people of various countries. The conference's "Letter to the People of the World" and various resolutions put forward specific action programs for the future struggles of the people of Asia and Africa and their solidarity and cooperation in the struggle. The "Letter to the People of the World" adopted by the conference said: "The people of Asia and Africa have reached a higher degree of unity in the task of supporting peace, and have reached the point of having a common action program."

    After this, the African Independent States Conference held in April 1958 and the All-African People's Conference held in December also issued righteous and stern condemnations of the bloody crimes of imperialism's cruel rule over the colonial people, and unanimously called for strengthening solidarity and fighting together. These two meetings reflected the strong desire of the African people to unite and strive for national independence, and helped strengthen the unity of the African people in the anti-colonialist struggle for national independence.

    In Latin America, despite US obstruction and sabotage, the national democratic and progressive forces of Latin American countries are also strengthening their mutual ties in the common struggle against US aggression, interference, and plunder. The demand for Latin American countries to establish economic group ties and cooperation to get rid of US control is also constantly growing. The strengthening of economic ties between Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Venezuela, etc. illustrates this point.

    In the struggle against US and other imperialist aggression in the Middle East, and in the entire struggle to defend and strive for independence, the mutual support and sympathy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has been greatly strengthened in recent years. The imperialist conspiracies to defeat each other and sow discord have been repeatedly thwarted. The union of socialist countries, nationally independent countries, and all nations striving for liberation, and the establishment and expansion of vast peace regions, is a guarantee that the cause of opposing aggression and defending peace will advance from victory to greater victory.

    民族独立运动巨大发展的一年
    邢章
    1958年是国际和平力量、社会主义革命力量和民族革命力量取得重大发展，帝国主义和反动力量进一步削弱的一年。在这一年中，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动全面高涨，有力地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义集团的军事侵略和其他阴谋活动，加速了帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解过程。
    社会主义和民族革命力量是新生力量，正在上升发展；帝国主义是腐朽的力量，正在面临着严重的政治和经济危机。
    尖锐的斗争　巨大的胜利
    在空前有利的国际形势下，民族独立运动经历了尖锐的斗争，取得了巨大的胜利。
    民族独立运动正在从远东、中东向非洲和拉丁美洲扩展，锐气风发，不可抗拒。中东地区成了反殖民主义斗争最激烈的地区。伊拉克人民的革命胜利，具有特别重大的意义。它推翻了费萨尔—赛义德卖国政权，打乱了帝国主义在中东的侵略阵线。美英帝国主义发动了疯狂的反扑，妄图扼杀伊拉克革命，从而把中东民族独立运动镇压下去。但是，美英侵略行动可耻地失败了。伊拉克共和国保卫住了，黎巴嫩人民把夏蒙撵下了台，这是阿拉伯人民继苏伊士事件、叙利亚事件之后取得的又一重大胜利。同时，在阿拉伯半岛阿曼和亚丁地区人民继续进行着抗击英国侵略的斗争。
    非洲争取独立自由的斗争，光芒四射。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民同法国殖民军队进行的武装斗争，进入了新的阶段，独立的阿尔及利亚临时政府成立了。几内亚也取得了独立。戴高乐独裁政府合并非洲法属殖民地的狂妄计划，遭到了沉重的打击。法属西非和其他许多法属非洲殖民地国家人民，决不满足于成为法兰西联邦内的共和国的地位，他们要求取得完全独立。英国、意大利、比利时等旧殖民主义国家在非洲的统治，也发生了动摇。尼日利亚、多哥、喀麦隆和索马里兰人民纷纷要求在1960年以前取得独立。非洲大陆正处在一个伟大变革的前夕。
    拉丁美洲民族独立运动的发展，突出地表现在反独裁反美斗争的进展上。委内瑞拉人民一举推翻了美国帝国主义扶植达十年之久的独裁政权，并在7、9和11三个月内，先后三次粉碎了美国策划的颠覆阴谋。古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政权也在古巴起义军节节胜利的进攻下垮了台。目前拉丁美洲只剩两个军事独裁国家了，即多米尼加和巴拉圭。美帝国主义已成了拉丁美洲人民憎恨的中心。尼克松的挨揍，生动地证明了这一点。民族革命的熊熊火焰，正在美国“后院”燃烧着。
    争取经济独立反对外国掠夺
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民在争取独立、自由的同时，展开了摆脱外国垄断资本的掠夺和争取民族经济的独立发展的斗争。
    广大的民族独立国家在争得政治独立后，发展自己的民族经济成了它们重大的迫切任务。帝国主义竭力企图保持在这些国家的经济垄断地位，并继续进行经济渗透，加紧争夺商品市场和势力范围。美帝国主义在这方面展开的经济攻势，对经济不发达国家的威胁最大。1957年秋季开始的美国经济危机和它转嫁经济危机的行为，使经济不发达国家遭到了严重的经济灾难。
    美国一方面故意压低原料进口价格，减少和限制原料商品进口额；另方面竭力抬高经济不发达国家所必需进口的工业品价格，并通过贷款、援助等方式变相输出过剩商品和大量倾销剩余农产品。这种双管齐下的经济掠夺手法，造成了经济不发达国家贸易逆差激增、外汇储备锐减的后果。菲律宾和巴基斯坦的经济困难更加严重。到1958年11月21日止，菲律宾已有一亿零四百多万比索（菲币）的赤字，1959年国家债务将达十五亿七千一百万比索，赤字将达四亿八千六百万比索。巴基斯坦1958财政年度的预算赤字比前年度增加了50％。美国限制石油进口使委内瑞拉被迫减少14％的石油开采量，每天至少损失二十五万美元；限制铅锌进口使玻利维亚的铅锌销售量减少40％，使秘鲁每年损失二千万美元。
    在这种情况下，美帝国主义同经济不发达国家之间的矛盾大大增长起来。在科伦坡计划会议和美洲“二十一国委员会”会议上，东南亚和拉丁美洲的许多国家代表，对美国的对外经济政策表示不满，要求美国稳定原料价格，并给予它们有效的援助，以度过目前的经济困难。但美国真正感到兴趣的，却是怎样千方百计地利用这些国家的经济困难，扩大商品倾销和资本输出，加强对它们的政治经济控制。
    但是，帝国主义任意奴役和剥削的时代，一去不复返了。它们争取摆脱帝国主义掠夺，促进平等互利的国际经济合作，发展民族经济的斗争，正在发展起来。亚非人民团结大会通过的“关于经济问题的决议”和根据这次大会建议召开的亚非经济会议关于成立一个亚非经济合作组织的建议，以及非洲独立国家会议和全非人民大会上关于发展民族经济的呼声，都反映了亚非人民加强经济合作、争取民族经济独立发展的强烈要求。
    最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义
    在这一年反殖民主义和保卫民族独立的尖锐斗争中，彻底暴露了美帝国主义是民族独立运动最凶恶的敌人，同时它又是一只纸老虎。
    美帝国主义一直竭力隐藏自己的真面目，并以各种伪善和狡猾手段，把自己打扮成民族独立运动的朋友。在英、法、以色列发动侵埃战争时期，它甚至以停火的积极支持者的姿态出现，为自己推行“艾森豪威尔主义”猎取政治资本。但当伊拉克的革命一声爆发，美国的假面具就立即撕破了，它顾不得任何打扮，进行了赤裸裸的军事侵略，在联合国大会紧急特别会议上作为侵略者的被告地位受审。中东事件的重大政治意义之一，正在于美国的公开侵略使阿拉伯人民和整个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民擦亮了眼睛，识破了美帝国主义的真面目，并体验到只要进行坚决的斗争，美帝国主义也是可以被击败的。
    但是，美帝国主义是不甘心失败的。它在中东地区的侵略活动，正在转入威胁利诱和分化挑拨的恶毒攻势方面。它正在“弥补”巴格达条约，拼凑“北层联盟”，同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦谈判缔结军事协定，并唆使以色列进行威胁活动。同时，它竭力进行颠覆伊拉克共和国和挑拨阿拉伯国家关系的阴谋。最近，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁、国防部长麦克耳罗伊、助理国务卿朗特里的相继到中东“访问”，就是进行这个卑鄙的勾当。
    在其他地区，美帝国主义也在加紧进行镇压民族独立运动的阴谋活动。美国利用印度尼西亚叛乱集团进行颠覆活动失败后，继续支持叛乱集团的残余分子成立所谓“苏门答腊国”，并策划荷兰、澳大利亚成立所谓“伊里安国”，以阻挠印度尼西亚收复西伊里安。美国正在非洲进行扩张，排挤旧殖民势力，破坏非洲民族独立运动。在拉丁美洲地区，美国一再对委内瑞拉等推翻了美帝国主义代理人独裁政权的国家进行颠覆活动，并曾公然企图以武装干涉来扑灭古巴人民的武装起义。尼克松、杜勒斯和密尔顿·艾森豪威尔的先后“访问”拉丁美洲，说明美国统治集团是多么急忙于策划镇压拉丁美洲民族独立运动的阴谋活动。
    美帝国主义在凶恶地镇压民族独立运动的时候，总是打着反共反苏的破烂幌子，下死劲诬蔑社会主义阵营给予民族独立运动的真诚支持，挑拨民族独立国家同社会主义国家的友好关系。这是因为，事实越来越有力地证明，苏联和全体社会主义国家给予民族独立运动各方面的支持，它们之间在反对侵略和维护和平的斗争中的合作，已成了帝国主义为维持殖民体系而进行疯狂挣扎的严重障碍。
    民族独立运动最忠实的朋友
    从世界上还只有一个社会主义国家苏联的年代，到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的强大发展的今天，社会主义国家一贯采取明确的无产阶级国际主义的立场，把它对一切反殖民主义的斗争的支援看作是自己的不可推诿的义务。
    这几年来，当帝国主义险恶的侵略战争的乌云笼罩着埃及、叙利亚和伊拉克的时候，一再给予阿拉伯人民以最大的声援，制止了侵略者的血手的，就是以苏联为首的社会主义各国。这次美英对中东的联合侵略行动，是对民族独立运动和世界和平的特别凶恶的进攻。但在社会主义国家九亿多人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决支援下，阿拉伯人民终于把美英侵略者赶出了中东。这又一次生动地表明：社会主义和民族革命力量大于帝国主义力量，前者的联合是帝国主义所不能匹敌的。
    这一年里，印度尼西亚人民在粉碎美国支持的军事叛乱的斗争中，阿尔及利亚人民在抗击法国殖民战争的武装斗争中，阿曼、也门人民在反对英国侵略的斗争中，也都得到了社会主义国家的声援。在联合国和其他国际会议上，苏联和其他社会主义国家不断揭露和抨击帝国主义的侵略和干涉阴谋，支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安、塞浦路斯人民要求自决的斗争，坚决捍卫一切被压迫被侵略的民族的利益。
    为了帮助一切取得了民族独立的国家发展自己的经济，苏联和其他社会主义国家不附带任何条件地给予了经济技术援助。民族独立国家同社会主义国家的经济联系和经济合作，也有利于民族独立国家经济的发展。这同美国的所谓“援助”、“合作”以及帝国主义国家利用经济不发达国家的困难而加强掠夺的政策形成了鲜明的对照。
    当美国对坚持民族独立的埃及、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家实行经济封锁的时候，苏联和其他社会主义国家帮助它们冲破了封锁。当阿拉伯联合共和国要求外国援助它修建阿斯旺水坝，而美国会同英国和世界银行向埃及政府提出贷款的种种苛刻条件，然后又以侮辱性方式撤销了贷款的时候，苏联向阿联提供四亿卢布的贷款，同阿联签订了援助水坝第一期工程的协定。当帝国主义国家千方百计地阻挠不发达国家的民族工业的发展，使它们难于输入机器和设备，并对它们实行剩余农产品和消费品倾销，严重损害它们的民族经济的时候，苏联和其他社会主义国家在联合国和其他国际会议上提出了有助于经济不发达国家发展经济的许多建议和方案，并依据不发达国家的需要和要求提供援助和输出机器设备。例如，美国拒绝给阿根廷政府以政府投资，使阿根廷无法购买它发展石油工业所必需的机器和设备，并大力鼓励私人投资，借以渗入和掠夺阿根廷的石油资源；而苏联则对阿根廷提供四亿卢布的贷款，充作阿根廷购买发展石油工业所必需的机器和设备之用。正是因为这样，社会主义国家同亚非和拉丁美洲各国的贸易和经济往来，也有了很大的发展。
    社会主义国家对不发达国家提供无私援助，相互发展经济合作，打破了帝国主义首先是美帝国主义“援助”不发达国家的“垄断”地位，并使越来越多的人识破了帝国主义国家假“援助”之名而行掠夺之实的丑恶面目，认清了社会主义国家是它们发展民族经济的支持者。甚至对美国的“援助”和投资有很大幻想的巴西总统库比契克，也在一次公开讲话中比较了美苏两国对外经济政策，指出苏联给予不发达国家的经济援助的有利性质。在美洲“二十一国委员会”会议上，巴西代表施密特猛烈抨击美国的政策，他认为扩大与苏联和中国的贸易就会使巴西免于遭到经济上的枯竭。许多拉丁美洲国家政界人士纷纷要求同社会主义国家发展贸易和经济关系。
    加强团结　走向更大胜利
    在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争中，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的团结在不断加强。这是民族独立运动强大发展的重要因素。
    作为亚非人民团结起来反对帝国主义和殖民主义的里程碑的是1957年12月26日至1958年1月1日举行的“亚非人民团结大会”。这是一次具有历史意义的会议。亚非各国代表在大会上有力地揭发了殖民制度的罪恶，愤怒地谴责了帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略活动，并对各国人民的斗争互相作了有力的支持。大会的“告世界人民书”和各项决议为亚非两洲人民今后的斗争和在斗争中的团结合作提出了具体的行动纲领。大会通过的“告世界人民书”说：“亚非人民在支持和平的任务中已经达到了更高度的团结，而且已经达到了有共同的行动纲领的地步”。
    在这以后，在1958年4月间举行的非洲独立国家会议和12月间举行的全非人民大会也都对帝国主义残酷统治殖民地人民的血腥罪行，提出了义正辞严的谴责，并一致呼吁加强团结共同斗争。这两次会议反映了非洲人民团结起来争取民族独立的强烈愿望，并有助于加强非洲人民在反殖民主义，争取民族独立斗争中的团结。
    在拉丁美洲，尽管有美国的阻挠和破坏，拉丁美洲各国民族民主进步力量在反对美国的侵略、干涉和掠夺的共同斗争中，也正在加强相互的联系。拉丁美洲国家建立经济集团联系和合作，以摆脱美国控制的要求，也在不断增长中。阿根廷、巴西、玻利维亚、智利、委内瑞拉等经济联系的加强，就说明了这一点。
    在反对美国和其他帝国主义侵略中东的斗争中，在维护和争取独立的整个斗争中，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的相互声援和同情，近年来都有了很大的加强。帝国主义各个击破、挑拨离间的阴谋，一再遭到打击。社会主义国家和民族独立国家以及一切争取解放的民族的联合，广大和平地区的建立和扩大，是反对侵略和维护和平的事业从胜利走向更大胜利的保证。
