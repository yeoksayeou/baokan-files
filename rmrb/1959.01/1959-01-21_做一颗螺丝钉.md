Be a Screw

Wu Lü

A small screw, yet like the main components on various machines and equipment, is absolutely indispensable. In mechanical industrial production, we must grasp the major components, and also grasp the screws. According to statistics, screws often account for 50% to 60% of the total number of parts in various machines. A 1A-62 lathe has 1,600 screws, and a 1,500 kilowatt steam turbine has 4,000 screws. Without screws, even if the main components are present, the machine will not start, or if it barely starts, it will eventually stop.

There are many things like screws that seem insignificant but are also of great importance. Without a chain, a bicycle can only be displayed; without a switch, even the most ingenious electrical equipment is difficult to start; without small repair and fitting factories, thousands upon thousands of machines will be unable to move after even slight damage. A screw, a small part, a small repair and fitting factory, all seem unremarkable, but without them, the "big picture" is affected. During the Great Leap Forward last year, many factories producing small parts like screws switched to producing major machine components, and many small repair and fitting factories switched to mechanical manufacturing. In the industrial sector, this is called "upgrading." "Upgrading" is certainly a good thing. Our country doesn't have too many factories capable of manufacturing machines, but rather too few. Those factories producing small parts like screws and repair and fitting factories can use their original foundations, without spending much money, to enrich the country's mechanical manufacturing power, which is certainly a great thing, a side of the Great Leap Forward in China's industrial production, and this should be affirmed.

However, we cannot therefore think that screws and repair and fitting are unimportant. On the contrary, the more production leaps forward, the greater the need for screws and the more repair and fitting work there will be. Therefore, the competent departments in various regions should also make overall arrangements for the production of repair parts like screws in this year's plans, so that the manufacturing capacity and repair capacity, the manufacturing capacity of large main components and the manufacturing capacity of small parts maintain a compatible ratio. Some transitioned factories that used to produce parts and specialized in repair and fitting should also return to their posts and resume their old business. The purpose is for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

For small factories that produce small parts like screws and do repair and fitting, it is necessary to be content with the production of screws and happy to do repair and fitting. This requires resolving the ideological problem of so-called "chicken beak" versus "ox tail." Whether it is a chicken beak or an ox tail, it is an inseparable part of the animal. Although there are different divisions of labor, both are needed and indispensable. Small factories producing small parts like screws and repair and fitting factories, like mechanical factories manufacturing large main components, only have different divisions of labor, and there is no difference in status.

Thousands upon thousands of communist party members with great ambitions take being a screw as their motto. The small screw is both ordinary and extraordinary. The workers of small factories that produce small parts like screws and do repair and fitting should, like the workers of the Shenyang Screw Factory, establish a sense of professional pride: be a screw in the country's construction!

    做一颗螺丝钉
    吴滤
    小小一颗螺丝钉，却同各种机器设备上的主件一样，是绝对不能缺少的。在机械工业生产中，要抓大主件，也要抓螺丝钉。据统计，在各种机械的零件总数中，螺丝钉往往占了50％至60％。一台1Ａ六二车床上有一千六百个螺丝钉，一台一千五百瓩的汽轮机上有四千个螺丝钉。缺了螺丝钉，尽管主件具备，机器还是转动不起来，或者勉强让它转动，最终还是要停摆。
    像螺丝钉这类看来无足轻重，却也关系重大的事情还有不少。没有链条，自行车只能摆着做样子；没有开关，电器设备虽百般灵巧也难以启动；没有修修配配的小工厂，千千万万的机器稍有损坏便不能动弹。一颗螺丝钉，一种小零件，一个修修配配的小工厂，看来都没有什么了不起，但缺了它，却影响“大局”。在去年大跃进中，有许多生产螺丝钉之类小零件的工厂转向生产机器的大主件，也有许多修修配配的小工厂转向机械制造。这在工业部门，被叫做“升级”。“升级”当然是件好事。我们国家能制造机器的工厂不是太多了，而是太少了。那些生产螺丝钉之类小零件和修修配配的小工厂，利用自己原有的基础，不花多少钱，就能充实国家机械制造的力量，这当然是一件绝大的好事，是我国工业生产大跃进的一个侧面，这是应当肯定的。
    然而，却不能因此就认为螺丝钉和修修配配不重要了。相反，生产越向前跃进，螺丝钉的需要量也就越大，修修配配的业务也就越来越多，因此各地的主管部门在安排今年的计划中，也要统筹安排一下螺丝钉之类的修配零件的生产，使制造能力和修配能力、大主件的制造能力和小零件的制造能力保持相适应的比例。某些转业的生产零件的和专事修配的小厂，还应当归队，重操旧业。目的是为了今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    对于生产螺丝钉之类小零件和修修配配的小工厂说来，要安于螺丝钉的生产，乐于修修配配。这就一定要解决所谓“鸡口”“牛后”的思想问题。鸡口也罢，牛后也罢，都是动物身上不可分割的一部分。分工虽有不同，却都是需要的，缺一不可。生产螺丝钉之类小零件和修修配配的小工厂，同制造大主件的机械工厂，也只有分工的不同，而无高低的不同。
    千千万万胸怀大志的共产党员都以做一颗螺丝钉为自己的座右铭。小小螺丝钉，平凡又不平凡。生产螺丝钉之类小零件和修修配配的小工厂的职工，应该像沈阳螺钉厂的工人一样，树立职业的自豪感：做国家建设中的一颗螺丝钉！
