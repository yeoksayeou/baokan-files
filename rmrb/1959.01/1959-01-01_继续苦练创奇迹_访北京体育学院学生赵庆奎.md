    Continue to Work Hard and Create Miracles
    —An Interview with Zhao Qingkui, Student of Beijing Sport University
    “In 1959, I not only want to continue to improve the world record for the clean and jerk, but I am also preparing to challenge the world records for the snatch and the total score.” Zhao Qingkui, the twenty-two-year-old world record holder for the clean and jerk in the light heavyweight class, expressed this determination in an interview with reporters on the eve of New Year's Day, 1959.
    Zhao Qingkui said: "Since I first participated in the national weightlifting competition in March 1955, my total score has increased by a full 150 kilograms. In 1958, when I participated in the Moscow International Weightlifting Championships, I won the second place. In domestic competitions with some foreign weightlifters of the same weight class from the Soviet Uzbek Republic, the United Arab Republic, and Poland, I won all the matches. In this year, I broke the world record for the clean and jerk in the light heavyweight class, which had been held by the American athlete Jan George for nearly two years, twice."
    Under the Party’s cultivation over the past few years, Zhao Qingkui has achieved quite remarkable achievements in weightlifting, but he is still very dissatisfied with these achievements. He said: "Although my total score in 1958 reached 432.5 kilograms, it actually only increased by 15 kilograms compared to 1957. This speed is still very disproportionate compared to the great leap forward in the national industry and agriculture." "If I could concentrate the best results I achieved in each individual event in 1958 (130 kilograms in the press, 132.5 kilograms in the snatch, and 177.5 kilograms in the clean and jerk) in one performance, then my total score would be 440 kilograms, which would be equivalent to the level of the champion of the 1958 World Weightlifting Championships."
    Zhao Qingkui is full of confidence in realizing his wishes for the coming year. He said: "Since our country can create many miracles in industry and agriculture, it should and certainly can create even greater achievements in sports."

    继续苦练创奇迹
    ——访北京体育学院学生赵庆奎
    “1959年我不但要继续提高挺举的世界纪录，而且还准备向抓举和总成绩的世界纪录进行冲击。”二十二岁的轻重量级挺举世界纪录保持者赵庆奎，在1959年元旦前夕同记者谈话时，表示了这样的决心。
    赵庆奎说：“自从我1955年3月第一次参加全国性的举重比赛到现在，总成绩已整整提高了一百五十公斤。1958年，我参加莫斯科奖个人国际举重比赛时，曾经取得亚军；在国内同来自苏联乌兹别克共和国、阿拉伯联合共和国和波兰的一些同一等级的外国举重选手比赛时，又获得了全胜；在这一年中，两次刷新了由美国运动员詹·乔治保持了将近两年的轻重量级挺举的世界纪录。”
  在党几年来的培养下，赵庆奎在举重方面已经取得了相当突出的成就，但他对他这些成就还很不满意。他说：“1958年我的总成绩虽然已经达到四百三十二点五公斤，但实际上只比1957年提高了十五公斤。这种速度同全国工、农业大跃进的形势比较，还很不相称。”“如果我能把1958年我在每个单项方面所取得的最好成绩（推举一百三十公斤，抓举一百三十二点五公斤，挺举一百七十七点五公斤）集中在一次表现出来，那么我的总成绩就应该是四百四十公斤，这就相当于1958年世界举重锦标赛冠军的水平了。”
    赵庆奎对实现他未来一年的愿望充满了信心。他说：“既然我国能在工、农业方面创造出许多奇迹，在体育运动方面也应该和一定能够创造出比目前更大的成绩来。”
