Western Policies Are Not Working

The Soviet government's proposal to end the foreign occupation of Berlin and make West Berlin a free city has been around for more than forty days. The Soviet government's proposal has attracted widespread attention from countries around the world. All governments and people who truly cherish the cause of peace and are sincerely concerned about the fate of the German people welcome this initiative by the Soviet government, which is conducive to peace in Europe and the world. In particular, the people and government of the German Democratic Republic, which is most closely related to the Berlin issue, have expressed warm support and endorsement. The GDR government sent a reply to the Soviet Union on the 7th and issued a memorandum on the 9th, expressing its agreement with the Soviet government's proposal, willing to discuss the status of West Berlin, and will do its best to make West Berlin a free city. The GDR government's agreement to grant the West Berlin, which should be part of its territory, the status of an independent city is a major contribution to strengthening peace in Europe and for the benefit of all the German people.

In Western countries, the Soviet government's proposal has also received widespread positive reactions. Western news agencies had to admit that the Soviet proposal "has considerable appeal to the world." First of all, in West Germany, which is directly affected by the West Berlin issue, many groups and bourgeois newspapers believe that the situation in which West Berlin is increasingly becoming a center of the "Cold War" must be ended, and that the Soviet note is a document of great significance, which is not only conducive to the cause of peace, but also helps to eliminate the hotbed of tension in Europe through negotiations. Many bourgeois opinions also believe that the Soviet government's proposal on the West Berlin issue will create conditions for promoting the reunification of Germany. In this regard, even Mess, a former member of the Bundestag of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union, said that the Soviet proposal pointed out the way to broadly ease international tensions, which may be a prerequisite for solving the German problem.

At the same time, in other Western European countries, public opinion praised the Soviet proposal as a positive factor in improving the situation in Germany and Europe. Even those political figures and newspapers that have always been keen on the "Cold War" admit that the Soviet government's proposal is "reasonable" and "impeccable" and should not be rejected lightly. British Conservative MP Hictonbrook and the Conservative tabloid "Daily Express," with a circulation of four million copies, advocated that Eastern and Western troops withdraw from Berlin.

In the United States, some influential newspapers and figures have also criticized the West's policy toward Germany as "outdated" and demanded that officials "re-examine the German situation without prejudice." Prominent political commentator Walter Lippmann even had to admit that to solve the problem of German reunification, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that there are two Germanys. Lippmann also said: "The Adenauer policy of not recognizing East Germany must be greatly revised." In any case, the emergence of this argument reflects that within the political circles of the United States and Britain, some people feel that the Western countries' policy toward the German problem is not working. Especially now that the Soviet government has proposed the establishment of a free city in West Berlin, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Western countries to cling to this past policy.

A Stubborn Attitude and Conspiracy

But in this case, what is the attitude of Western governments?

The Soviet government's proposal once made Western countries feel "shocked and uneasy." For this reason, they hurriedly issued various statements. But these statements, in addition to saying a series of "no" and "rejection," they can not put forward any legitimate reasons to oppose the Soviet proposal. Among these countries, the Adenauer government of West Germany and the US government have formed the main force in frantically opposing the Soviet proposal. Adenauer tried his best to implore Western countries not to withdraw their occupying forces in West Berlin, and to ask the "allies" to adopt a "tough attitude" in dealing with the Soviet Union. West German newspapers even clamored "fight for West Berlin, die for West Berlin." The US government, on the one hand, declared that the United States does not intend to withdraw from West Berlin; on the other hand, it arrogantly clamored to use "resort to force if necessary" in an attempt to intimidate. However, all this cannot obliterate the impact of the Soviet government's proposal. Even the US "Baltimore Sun" had to admit: If the West cannot put forward any arguments and counter-proposals, but only insist on "rejecting" and trying to write this matter off, it will not work. Because the residents of West Germany are very interested in the Soviet proposal. Some Western news agencies further pointed out that when the world's broad public opinion welcomes the Soviet government's proposal, Western countries can only arouse the opposition of world public opinion if they stubbornly shake their heads and say "no."

It is precisely in this situation that Western countries have had to restrain their nakedly hostile attitude towards the Soviet proposal and instead use the so-called "counter-proposal" to discuss the entire German problem to resist the Soviet government's proposal in order to deceive world opinion. The North Atlantic Group Council Communiqué in mid-December last year and the recent replies from the United States, Britain, France and West Germany to the Soviet government stubbornly refused to abandon their occupation system of West Berlin, but at the same time hypocritically proposed to discuss the Berlin issue with the Soviet government in a broader scope of resolving the German problem and European security issues. However, the solution to the German problem that they put forward is still the long-outdated plan of a unified Germany that is supposed to hold "free elections" and annex the German Democratic Republic. Facts have long proved that this plan has no other effect than hindering German reunification. The reason why Western countries want to bring up the German problem is to tie the Berlin problem to the knot they have made on the German reunification problem, thereby hindering the solution of the Berlin problem.

Unjustifiable Excuses

In order to defend their conspiracy to deliberately occupy West Berlin for a long time and oppose the Soviet government's proposal, Western countries have constantly put forward various absurd arguments for a period of time. First of all, they sophistically said that they do not intend to withdraw from West Berlin because they have "inherent rights of occupation" over Berlin. They even said: "The three Western countries are stationed there as occupying countries," so "they are not prepared to give up their rights obtained by victory." This excuse is of course untenable. Even the recent replies from Western countries to the Soviet Union had to admit that after thirteen years since the end of the war, it is "abnormal" that the occupation system formulated in 1945 is still retained in a part of German territory. What's more, the fact that there are two sovereign states on German territory today has been almost ten years. Since the Soviet Union has established relations between sovereign states with the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Republic, together with its capital Berlin, is a completely sovereign state. There is no occupying country in this country at all, let alone any "rights of occupation." The emphasis of the Western countries on the so-called "rights of occupation obtained by victory" can only show that the Western countries fought against Hitler's fascism not, as the people of the world hoped, to eliminate the aggressive forces that endanger world peace and allow the people of the world, including the German people, to live a peaceful life again, but to occupy German territory for a long time.

Western countries have never been able to come up with any decent defensible reason for the Soviet government's point that the three Western countries have undermined the Potsdam Agreement and thus lost the legal basis for occupying West Berlin. So they either avoid talking about it, or they insist that "the status of Berlin does not depend on this agreement," but is based on the agreements on the control of Berlin in 1944 and 1945. Western countries even falsely accused the Soviet Union of "unilaterally betraying international obligations." This is really shameless to the extreme. People know that the Potsdam Agreement, which requires the eradication of the scourge of German militarism and Nazism so that it will no longer threaten world peace, reflects the universal aspirations of the people of all countries after the war and should be the highest criterion for the post-war settlement of the German problem. Many specific measures on the control of Germany and the eradication of militarist forces were also formulated in accordance with the spirit of this highest criterion. Take the temporary occupation of Germany by the four major powers after the war, isn't its purpose precisely to fulfill the responsibility of helping to restore domestic order in Germany and completely eradicate the militarist and Nazi forces in Germany? Isn't it precisely to turn Germany from a source of war in Europe into a peaceful and democratic Germany? But the facts of the past few years have proved that the Western countries' occupation of West Berlin has long abandoned this lofty obligation. In this case, what is the significance of Western countries using the agreements of 1944 and 1945 as an excuse? Even the West German bourgeois newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung" had to admit: At present, "those premises on which the four-nation agreements signed between 1944 and 1945 were based no longer exist in reality."

Cold War Clamor Cannot Intimidate People

Western countries, especially the United States, are currently carrying out a series of war clamors around the Berlin issue. The US power figures and generals have repeatedly shouted about the "Berlin crisis," "the Soviet ultimatum," "the Soviet threat," etc., in an attempt to stir up a "Cold War" atmosphere. Obviously, the United States wants to divert attention, frame the Soviet Union, and disguise itself as the "protector" of the freedom and security of the people of West Berlin. At the same time, the United States wants to use this kind of tense atmosphere to cover up the numerous contradictions between the North Atlantic aggressive group and "unify" its increasingly centrifugal "allies" under its control. But can ironclad facts be reversed by the clamor of the United States? Everyone can see that it is precisely the Western countries that have painstakingly regarded West Berlin, located in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, as a "front-line city" deep into the German Democratic Republic, and as a springboard for sabotage and subversion of the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, seriously threatening peace in Europe and the world. The Soviet government's proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city is precisely to remove this malignant tumor that endangers world peace and turn this past Cold War base of West Berlin into a peaceful city. The Soviet government did not threaten with force at all when it put forward this reasonable proposal, but advocated that the four major powers and the two Germanys conduct peaceful negotiations within six months to jointly solve the Berlin issue. But it is precisely the Western countries that stubbornly insist on the occupation system of West Berlin, and openly carry out military threats, clamoring that Western countries should use force to "break into" Berlin, and Henry Hodes, commander of the US Army in Europe, even shouted that they are ready to fight to "protect the western region." What is all this if not a naked military threat? Of course, peace-loving and powerful socialist countries will never be intimidated by this clamor of US generals. Soviet Premier Khrushchev once pointed out that if the West wants to use troops and tanks to clear the road to Berlin, it means war, because the other side also has tanks and other more powerful weapons that will not be shelved. This is obviously a powerful warning to those warmongers. But Western countries have made a big fuss about this, and hysterically shouted about "the Soviet threat." Western countries use West Berlin as a base to threaten peace, clamor to use force to "break in," and "prepare for battle," this is not called a "threat," but the Soviet government advocates resolving the West Berlin issue through peaceful negotiations, but it is a "threat" to freedom and security, can this deceive people? Elvers, chairman of the German League for Reunification, Peace and Freedom in West Germany, said it well: What is currently being said to be a threat is essentially caused by the West's own policy - "position of strength" and "Cold War" policy.

Now, in order to peacefully resolve the German problem as soon as possible, the Soviet government put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany on the 10th. And informed the governments of the countries concerned to hold a peace conference within two months to sign a peace treaty with Germany. If the Western countries are at all sincere in their desire to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve the German problem, as expressed in their recent notes, then they should no longer stubbornly oppose this proposal of the Soviet Union. Otherwise, it can only show that Western countries still insist on not giving up their unreasonable occupation of West Berlin and resolving the issue of German reunification, and still stubbornly use West Berlin as a breeding ground for maintaining international tensions. This will only further expose their faces as aggressors and occupiers, which will also arouse greater opposition from world public opinion. No matter what plans Western countries have, what is certain is that they will not be able to stay in West Berlin for a long time. (Attached picture)

    赖着不走是不行的
    席林生
    西方的政策行不通了
    苏联政府提出关于结束外国对柏林的占领，使西柏林成为自由城市的建议已经四十多天了。苏联政府的建议引起了世界各国的普遍注意。一切真正珍视和平事业并热诚关怀德国人民的命运的各国政府和人民，都欢迎苏联政府这一有利于欧洲和世界和平的创议。其中特别与柏林问题关系最密切的德意志民主共和国的人民和政府，更表示了热烈的支持和拥护。民主德国政府在7日向苏联发出了复照，9日又发表了备忘录，表示赞同苏联政府的建议，愿意商谈有关西柏林地位问题，将用全力促使西柏林变为自由城市。民主德国政府同意给予这个理应属于它领土一部分的西柏林以独立城市的地位，是为了加强欧洲和平、为了全体德国人民的全民族利益而作出的重大贡献。
    在西方国家，苏联政府的建议也广泛地得到了肯定的反应。西方通讯社不得不承认，苏联的建议“对世界有相当大的吸引力”。首先在直接感受西柏林问题影响的西德，许多团体和资产阶级报纸就认为：西柏林日益成为“冷战”中心的这种情况必须终止，而苏联的照会是一份有重大意义的文件，不仅有利于和平事业，而且也有助于通过谈判来消除欧洲紧张局势的策源地。不少资产阶级舆论还认为，苏联政府关于西柏林问题的建议将为促进德国的重新统一创造条件。在这方面甚至阿登纳的基督教民主联盟前联邦议会议员梅斯也说，苏联的建议指出了广泛地缓和国际紧张局势的道路，这可能是解决德国问题的前提。
    同时，在其他西欧国家，广大舆论也都称赞苏联的建议是改善德国和欧洲局势的积极的因素。甚至包括那些一贯热衷于“冷战”的政治人物和报纸也承认苏联政府的建议是“合情合理”、“无懈可击”，不应该轻率地加以拒绝。英国保守党议员希琴布鲁克和发行量达四百万份的保守党帝国派报纸“每日快报”，都主张东西方军队撤出柏林。
    在美国，一些有影响的报纸和人物也批评了西方对德政策“已经过时”，要求官方人士“无成见地重新研究德国情况”。著名政论家李普曼甚至不得不承认，要解决德国统一问题，必须重视存在着两个德国的事实。李普曼还说：“要大大修改阿登纳不承认东德国家的政策。”不管怎样，这种论调的出现，反映出在美英两国政界内部，也有人感到西方国家对德国问题的政策是行不通了。特别当现在苏联政府提出了建立西柏林自由城市的建议的时候，西方国家还要死抱住过去的这种政策是越来越困难了。
      死硬的态度和阴谋
    但是，在这种情况下，西方国家政府的态度是怎样呢？
    苏联政府的建议曾经使西方国家感到“震惊和不安”。为此它们急急忙忙发表了各种各样的声明。但是这些声明除了一连说许多“不”和“拒绝”之外，它们提不出任何一点正当的理由来反对苏联的建议。在这些国家中，特别是西德的阿登纳政府和美国政府结成了疯狂反对苏联建议的主力。阿登纳竭力恳求西方国家不要撤退它们在西柏林的占领军，并且要“盟国”在对付苏联时要采取“强硬的态度”。西德的报纸甚至叫嚷“为西柏林而战、为西柏林而死”。美国政府一方面宣称，美国不打算撤出西柏林；另一方面又蛮横地叫嚣以“必要时诉诸武力”来妄图威吓。但是，这一切都不能够抹煞苏联政府的建议的影响。就连美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”也不得不承认：如果西方提不出任何论据和反建议，而只是一味“拒绝”，企图把这件事情一笔勾销，那是不行的。因为西德居民对苏联的建议实在十分感到兴趣。一些西方通讯社更指出，当世界广大舆论欢迎苏联政府的建议的时候，西方国家光是顽固地摇头说“不”，那只能激起世界舆论的反对。
    正是在这种情况下，西方国家不得不收敛一下赤裸裸敌视苏联建议的态度，转而用所谓讨论整个德国问题的“反建议”的办法来抵制苏联政府的建议，以便欺骗世界的舆论。去年12月中旬的北大西洋集团理事会公报以及不久前美、英、法和西德给苏联政府的复照，都顽固地不愿放弃它们对西柏林的占领制度，但同时却又假惺惺地提出要跟苏联政府在讨论解决德国问题和欧洲安全问题的更广泛的范围内讨论柏林问题。然而它们搬出来的解决德国问题的办法仍然是早已发霉的所谓举行“自由选举”并吞德意志民主共和国的统一德国计划。事实早已证明，这个计划除了阻碍德国统一之外没有什么别的作用。西方国家所以要抬出德国问题，是为了把柏林问题扣紧在他们给德国统一问题打下的死结上，从而阻碍柏林问题的解决。
      站不住脚的辩解
    为了替它们这种蓄意长期霸占西柏林，以及反对苏联政府的建议的阴谋辩护，一个时期来西方国家不断地提出了各种各样荒谬的论据。首先它们强词夺理地说，它们不打算撤出西柏林是因为它们拥有对柏林的“固有的占领权利”。它们甚至还说：“西方三国是作为占领国驻在那里的”，因此“它们不准备放弃它们由于胜利而得到的权利”。这种借口当然站不住脚。就连最近西方国家给苏联的复照中也不得不承认；在战争结束十三年之后，在德国一部分领土上竟仍然保留着1945年所制定的占领制度是“不正常的”。更何况今天在德国领土上存在着两个主权国家的事实也已经差不多十年了。由于苏联已经同德意志民主共和国建立了主权国家之间的关系，德意志民主共和国连同它的首都柏林是一个完全的主权国家。在这个国家里根本不存在什么占领国，更谈不上什么“占领权利”。西方国家强调所谓“由于胜利而得到的占领权利”，这只能说明西方国家跟希特勒法西斯作战，并不像世界人民所希望的那样，为了消灭为害世界和平的侵略势力，重新让世界人民包括德国人民过着安宁的生活，而是为了长期霸占德国的领土。
    西方国家对于苏联政府提出的，由于西方三国破坏波茨坦协定从而丧失了占领西柏林的法律根据这一点，始终拿不出半点像样的可以辩护的理由。于是它们要末避而不谈，要末就是硬说“柏林的地位并不取决于这个协定”，而是依据1944年和1945年关于管制柏林的协议。西方国家甚至还反诬苏联“片面背弃国际义务”。这真是不知羞耻到家了。人们知道，要求根除德国军国主义和纳粹主义祸害、使其不再威胁世界和平的波茨坦协定反映了战后各国人民的普遍愿望，应当是战后处置德国问题的最高的准则。许许多多关于管制德国和铲除军国主义势力的各种具体措施也都是依据这个最高准则的精神来制定的。就拿战后四大国对德国的暂时的占领来说，它的目的难道不正是为了履行帮助恢复德国国内秩序，彻底根除德国的军国主义和纳粹主义势力的责任吗？不正是为了使德国由一个欧洲的战争策源地变成一个和平和民主的德国吗？但是几年来的事实已经证明，西方国家对西柏林的占领早已背弃了这种崇高的义务。在这种情况下，西方国家还以1944年和1945年的协议作为借口还有什么意义呢？这连西德资产阶级报纸“南德意志报”也不得不承认：在目前“1944—1945年间签定的四国协定所依据的那些前提实际上早就不存在了”。
      冷战叫嚣吓不了人
    西方国家，特别是美国目前正在围绕着柏林问题进行一系列的战争叫嚣。美国的当权人物、将军都一再地叫喊什么“柏林危机”、“苏联的最后通牒”、“苏联的威胁”等等，企图以此煽起一股“冷战”的气氛。显然，美国是想转移视线，栽赃在苏联身上，而把自己打扮成西柏林人民的自由和安全的“保护者”。同时，美国又想以这样一种紧张的空气来掩盖北大西洋侵略集团之间的重重矛盾，并把它的日益离心离德的“盟国”“统一”在它的控制之下。但是，铁的事实岂是美国的叫嚣所能颠倒的？谁都看得出，正是西方国家处心积虑把位于民主德国心脏的西柏林作为深入民主德国内部的“前线城市”，并当作破坏和颠覆民主德国和其他社会主义国家的跳板，严重地威胁着欧洲和世界的和平。而苏联政府主张把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市正是为了割除这个为害世界和平的毒瘤，使这个过去的冷战基地的西柏林变成一个和平城市。苏联政府在提出这个合理的建议时丝毫也没有以武力相威吓，而是主张在六个月内由四大国和两个德国进行和平谈判来共同解决柏林问题。但正是西方国家既死硬地坚持占领西柏林制度，并公然进行武力威胁，叫嚷西方国家应当用武力“冲进”柏林，美国驻欧洲陆军司令亨利·霍迪斯甚至叫喊准备战斗来“保护西部地区。”这一切不是赤裸裸的军事威胁是什么？当然爱好和平和强大的社会主义国家是决不会被美国将军的这种叫嚣所吓倒的。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫曾经指出：如果西方要用军队和坦克来扫清通向柏林的道路，这就意味着战争，因为另一方也有坦克和其他更强有力的武器，不会搁置不用的。这显然是对于那些战争狂人的一个有力的警告。但是西方国家却又在这上面大做文章，歇斯底里地叫起“苏联的威胁”来。西方国家利用西柏林作为威胁和平的基地、叫嚷用武力“冲进去”、
  “准备战斗”这不叫
  “威胁”，而苏联政府主张用和平谈判来解决西柏林问题，倒反而是对自由和安全的“威胁”，这难道能够骗人吗？西德的德国争取统一、和平和自由联盟主席艾尔费斯说得好：目前被说成是威胁的东西，实质上是由西方自己的政策——“实力地位”和“冷战”政策——所造成的。
    现在，苏联政府为了早日和平解决德国问题，又在10日提出了对德和约草案。并照会有关各国政府在两个月内举行和会来签订对德和约。如果西方国家在最近照会中所表示的愿意跟苏联谈判解决德国问题的愿望还有一点真诚的意思的话，那么它们就不应该再顽固地反对苏联的这个建议。否则的话，只能表明西方国家仍然坚持不愿意放弃它们对西柏林的无理占领和解决德国的统一问题，仍然顽固地利用西柏林作为保持国际紧张局势的策源地。这只能更加暴露它们侵略者和占领者的面目，从而也将引起世界舆论更大的反对。不管西方国家有着什么打算，肯定的是，它们要想长期赖在西柏林不走是不行的。（附图片）
