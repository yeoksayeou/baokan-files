    Logistics Warriors in Universities
    Xinhua News Agency reporter He Qirui
    In order to cultivate talent for national construction, in universities, there are also many logistics service personnel who stick to their ordinary posts year after year, arranging life for teachers and students, and creating good conditions for teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Every year, when batches of university graduates leave school and go to construction posts, they often talk about these logistics warriors with gratitude.
    The reporter recently visited several service departments of Peking University and learned about some fragmentary stories. Although they are all very ordinary, they are deeply moving.
    As long as teachers and students eat well, we are not afraid to run more errands
    Peking University has more than 10,000 teachers, students, and staff. In order to make so many people eat well, the cooks have come up with various methods. During the most intense days of the great leap forward in scientific research, the cafeteria was open day and night, and teachers and students could eat whenever they came. Last summer, when teachers and students were digging a swimming pool in the rain, considerate cooks delivered bucket after bucket of ginger soup in a timely manner. The Peking University cafeteria is already quite good in terms of the possible conditions. But the cooks are not satisfied. They raise hundreds of pigs and dug ice cellars and vegetable cellars. In the season when vegetables are most abundant, the Peking University cafeteria prepares more than 100 kinds of side dishes for each meal. In the past, when teachers and students went to the city for meetings or temporary internships, they could only bring some cold steamed buns. After visiting several food stores in the city and suburbs, cooks Qiao Changhe and Zeng Jitian built a bread baking oven without spending a penny and baked golden bread for teachers and students to take with them when they went out. When teachers and students went on field internships, sometimes the cooks followed. In this way, even if the teachers and students were far away from the school, they could feel the care of the cooks. When the teachers and students of the Biology Department were interning in Jinshan, a western suburb of Beijing, the cook Zhang Zongqi went to the foot of the mountain several miles away every day to buy fresh vegetables, never complaining of being tired. Now, he has gone to the Northeast with the geology department internship team.
    The merits of the cooks are endless, and the feelings of the teachers and students for the cooks are also particularly deep. During the general election last spring, the voters of Peking University elected cook Hao Gang as a representative of the Haidian District People's Congress. The cook, who had been working as a cook for more than ten years, said emotionally at the radio conference: "Everyone elected me as a people's representative. We cooks feel very honored. This was something we couldn't even dream of in the past. Teachers and students, we cooks must make sure that everyone eats better, to ensure that you study hard and contribute more to national construction in the future."
    Every stitch and thread takes painstaking effort
    In people's impression, tailoring shops should make new clothes, but Peking University has a tailoring shop that specializes in mending old clothes for students.
    This tailoring shop used to make new clothes, but later the tailors discovered that some students accidentally tore their new clothes as soon as they put them on, and some old clothes needed mending. Some students threw away clothes that could still be worn because they couldn't find a place to mend them. After learning about this situation, the tailors held a meeting to discuss: Since students need it, why not add the business of mending clothes? So, with the approval of the leadership, starting in 1957, this tailoring shop began to mend clothes for students.
    The four tailors are very caring for the students. They know that some students still don't know how to arrange their lives properly. Therefore, when students send work to them, they consider it for the students in many ways. Once, a student sent a pair of broken woolen pants, saying that they could not be worn and wanted to make them into shorts. However, the tailor Sun Chengqi managed to mend them. It only cost 30 cents, and a pair of woolen pants "revived." The student was extremely happy.
    Mending clothes is a piecemeal job, but they never mind the trouble. As long as it is for the students, they accept jobs worth a few cents. After mending the clothes, they always look at them again and again. If they find small holes or loose buttons, they mend them along the way. When careless students later discover these handiwork of the tailors, their hearts are filled with gratitude.
    Everything for the Teachers and Students
    Peking University has a library with more than two million books. Such a wealth of books brings great benefits to teachers and students for teaching and scientific research. But who will take care of these books? Who will classify and number the books? And who will deliver the books that teachers and students want to them in a timely manner from so many collections? It is the librarians.
    The librarians here have a common slogan: "Everything for the readers!" During the great leap forward in scientific research last year, many teachers and students came to the library to look for reference materials. However, they spent a lot of time just looking through the catalog. Therefore, the librarians formed a "catalog consulting group" to help them search the catalog specifically until they borrowed the book. When the reporter visited the library, he saw a big-character poster and a letter of thanks. After understanding, it turned out that this was the case: Once, a class of students in the Russian Department wanted to study the issue of "Russian and Soviet Literature in China" and decided to browse the relevant old social science magazines. Han Xueqin, who worked in the old periodical reference reading room, and two librarians who were temporarily transferred to support them, received them. The students borrowed a lot of books at a time, flipping through them hastily, and if there were no materials they wanted inside, they would return them and borrow them again. Therefore, during the period they consulted the materials, these three librarians moved more than 6,000 old periodicals up and down, in and out. Afterwards, the students were very grateful, so they wrote letters and posted big-character posters to commend them.
    Han Xueqin is a 57-year-old man who came to work in this library in 1927. In the old society, not only were the wages meager, but even this small position was precarious. During the New Year and holidays, you had to give gifts to the curator. At that time, the students studying at Yenching University (now Peking University is located in the old site of Yenching University) were all young masters. If they were not served properly, they would not only scold you, but also write you a black note and stuff it into the "opinion box." This kind of life is gone forever for Han Xueqin. Now, he doesn't need to worry about his work and life at all. The teachers and students also respect him very much. When Mr. Han Xueqin recalled the changes before and after, he said with emotion: "How can I not work hard? I will do my job well, let the readers learn more knowledge, and build socialism well in the future. This is also my repayment and contribution to the Party and the government!"

    大学里的后勤战士
    新华社记者　贺启瑞
    为了培养国家建设人材，在大学里，也有许许多多的后勤服务人员年年月月地坚守在平凡的岗位上，为师生们安排生活，为师生们创造教学、科学研究和生产劳动的良好条件。每年，一批批大学毕业生离开学校走向建设岗位的时候，常常是怀着感激的心情谈论起这些后勤战士。
    记者最近访问了北京大学的几个服务部门，了解到了一些片断的事迹，它们虽然都很平常，但却深深感动人心。
    只要师生吃好，不怕多跑路
    北京大学师生员工有一万多人。为了使这么多人吃得好，炊事员们想出了各种各样的办法。在科学研究大跃进最紧张的日子里，食堂昼夜开放，师生随来随吃。去年暑假中，当师生们冒着雨挖游泳池的时候，体贴入微的炊事员适时地送来一桶又一桶的姜汤。北京大学的食堂，就可能的条件来说，已经办得不错了。但炊事员们还不满足，他们养了几百口猪，挖了冰窖、菜窖。蔬菜最丰富的季节，北京大学食堂里每餐光小菜就准备了一百多种。往年，师生们进城开会或临时外出实习，只能带些冷馒头。炊事员乔长和、曾继田在城里城外参观、访问了几家食品店以后，不花一文钱，砌起了烤面包的炉子，烤出了黄腊腊的面包，供师生们带着外出。师生们去野外实习，有时炊事员就跟着去。这样，师生们即使远离了学校，也能感受到炊事员的关怀。生物系师生在北京西郊金山实习时，炊事员张宗启每天都到山下几里远的地方购买新鲜蔬菜，从不叫累。现在，他又随着地质系实习队到东北去了。
    炊事员们的功绩说不完，师生们对炊事员们的感情也分外深厚。去年春天普选时，北京大学的选民们选举炊事员郝刚为海淀区人民代表。这位作了十几年炊事工作的炊事员在广播大会上感动地说：“大家选我当人民代表，我们当炊事员的感到十分光荣，这在过去是作梦也想不到的。老师们，同学们，我们炊事员一定要让大家吃得更好，保证你们好好学习，将来为国家建设出多点力。”
    针针线线费苦心
    在人们印象里，缝纫铺应该是作新衣服的，可是北京大学有一所缝纫铺却是专门为学生补旧衣的。
    这所缝纫铺原来也是作新衣服的，后来缝纫员们发现：学生们因为不小心，有些新衣服一穿上身就扯坏了，还有一些旧衣服需要补缝，有些学生因为找不到补缝的地方，把还能穿的衣服就给扔掉了。缝纫员们知道这些情况后，就开会商议：既然学生需要，为什么不增加补缝衣服的业务呢？于是，经领导同意，从1957年开始，这个缝纫铺便为学生们补衣服了。
    四个缝纫员对学生关怀备至。他们知道有的学生们还不会妥善安排自己的生活。因之，学生们送来活儿，他们就多方面替学生考虑。有一次，一个学生送来一条破呢子裤，说是不能穿了，要改一条短裤。可是，缝纫员孙承起设法补了补，只用了三毛钱，一条呢子裤“复活”了，那个学生高兴极了。
    补衣服是件零零碎碎的工作，但他们从来不嫌麻烦，只要是为了学生，几分钱的活儿也接收。补完衣服，他们总要翻来复去看看，如果发现有破了的小口和不牢靠了的扣子，便顺便给修补修补。当粗心的学生事后发现缝纫员们的这些手迹的时候，心里都充满了感谢。
    一切为了师生
    北京大学有一个藏书二百万册以上的图书馆。这么丰富的藏书，给师生们教学、科学研究带来很大的好处。可是，谁来保管这些书？谁来给书分类、分号？又是谁，在这么多藏书中及时地把师生们要的书送到他们手里呢？是图书馆员们。
    这里的图书馆员们，有一个共同的口号：“一切为了读者！”去年科学研究大跃进时，很多师生来图书馆寻找参考资料，可是，他们光查目录就花去了很多时间。于是，图书馆员们便成立了“目录咨询小组”，专门帮助他们查目录，直到把书借到为止。记者访问这个图书馆的时候看见了一张大字报和一封感谢信，经了解，原来是这么回事：有一次，俄语系有一个班的学生要研究“俄罗斯·苏联文学在中国”的问题，决定翻阅有关的旧的社会科学杂志。在旧期刊参考阅览室工作的韩学勤和临时调来支援的两位图书馆员接待了他们。学生们借书，一借就是一大堆，借去匆匆一翻，里面没有他们要的材料，就退回来重借。因之，在他们翻阅资料的期间，这三位图书馆员上上下下，出出进进，把六千多册旧期刊搬运了一遍。事后，学生们感激不已，于是写信、贴大字报表扬了他们。
    韩学勤是一个五十七岁的老人，1927年就来到这个图书馆工作。在旧社会，不但工资微薄，就是这个小职位也有朝不保夕的危险。过年过节，得给馆长送礼。当时在燕京大学上学（现在北京大学设在前燕京大学的旧址里）的都是公子哥儿，稍一侍候不到，骂了你不算，还给你写个黑条子，塞到“意见箱”里。这种生活对韩学勤来说已经一去不返了。现在，他的工作、生活丝毫用不着担心。师生们也很尊敬他。韩学勤老先生回忆起这前后的变化，不胜感慨地说：“我怎么能不好好的工作？我把我的工作作好，让读者多学些知识，将来好好建设社会主义，也算我对党和政府的报答和贡献！”（附图片）
