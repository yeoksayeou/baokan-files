The first blast furnace of the Linfen Iron and Steel Plant, which is under construction, was officially put into production on December 28th of last year. The volume of this blast furnace is 100 cubic meters. It took only seven months from the start of construction in May of last year to completion and commissioning.

Currently, at this iron and steel plant construction site, in addition to Blast Furnace No. 1 being put into production, the installation of Blast Furnace No. 2 has also been basically completed. At the same time, the workers have also installed five hot blast stoves and laid more than twenty *li* of water transmission pipelines, fifty *li* of dedicated heavy-rail railway in the mining area, as well as light rail railways within the plant. The installation of furnace foundations and furnace bodies for Blast Furnaces No. 3 and No. 4, as well as steelmaking and rolling workshops, are also under intense construction.

The Linfen Iron and Steel Plant is built at the foot of Ta'er Mountain in the east of Linfen City, where large amounts of iron ore are buried.

According to preliminary plans, after the Linfen Iron and Steel Plant is fully completed and put into production in 1962, it will be able to produce one million tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of steel annually. At the same time, it can also roll various steel products such as wire, medium plates, thin plates, and seamless steel pipes. (Attached picture)

    临汾钢铁厂出铁
    正在建设中的临汾钢铁厂的第一座高炉，已在去年12月28日正式投入生产。这座高炉的容积为一百立方公尺，从去年5月份开始动工到建成投入生产，仅仅用了七个月。
    现在，在这个钢铁厂工地上，除了一号高炉已经投入生产以外，二号高炉的安装工程也已基本竣工。与此同时，职工们还安装起了五个热风炉和铺设了二十多华里长的输水管道、五十华里的矿区重轨专用铁路，以及厂内的轻轨铁路。这个钢铁工地上三、四号高炉的炉基和炉身的安装，炼钢、轧钢等车间，目前也都在紧张施工中。
    临汾钢铁厂建在临汾城东塔儿山脚下，这里埋藏着大量铁矿。
    根据初步规划，临汾钢铁厂到1962年全部建成投入生产后，就可以年产生铁一百万吨、钢五十万吨，同时还可以轧制线材、中板、薄板和无缝钢管等多种钢材。（附图片）
