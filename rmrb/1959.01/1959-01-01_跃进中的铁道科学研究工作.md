Leaping Forward in Railway Scientific Research

Mao Yisheng

1958 was the greatest year in our country's history, and railway scientific research also achieved unprecedented development. A surprising number of scientific and technological innovations emerged in railway transportation operations. Scientific research blossomed throughout the entire railway system. Railways saw the emergence of some of the world's most advanced transportation technology and equipment manufactured entirely by ourselves, as well as complex and arduous engineering projects built with advanced technology.

At the "Eleventh" National Day exhibition last year, there were more than 6,000 achievements in railway science and technology, of which more than 400 could be called cutting-edge railway technologies. These exhibition projects were selected from more than 5 million inventions and rationalization proposals put forward by the masses. The vast majority of these exhibits were contributions from various units at railway production sites, and most of them were proposed to solve pressing problems in production, but many were also of a highly scientific level and of the nature of railway cutting-edge technology. This shows that scientific research has begun to appear in a dynamic situation on railway production sites. This is an extremely important turning point in the history of railway scientific research. From then on, research work embarked on a new socialist path of the mass line. At the inaugural meeting of the "China Association for Science and Technology," Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen pointed out four aspects of the development path of scientific and technological work in our country (see "Red Flag" magazine, issue 9), one of which is the mass line. This has already begun to be practiced by the 1.3 million employees of the railway industry. The two "simultaneous" and three "combinations" proposed in the instructions are the new direction followed by the Railway Scientific Research Institute. Currently, railway production units are setting up research institutes one after another. The number of railway colleges has increased from the original three to thirty. Scientific popularization movements have been widely carried out in railway transportation and construction work. Locomotive and rolling stock repair factories have become manufacturing factories. Various engineering sections have established 700 small factories producing building materials such as steel, cement, and bricks and tiles. The mechanization and automation movement is surging forward, and the technical appearance of railways is changing with each passing day. As it is today, in the future, the railway industry will develop a hundredfold, and the role of the mass movement in scientific research will inevitably become increasingly important, and the proportion of production sites in scientific research achievements will inevitably become larger and larger.

In research work, overall planning is very necessary. Railway scientific planning is a part of the national scientific planning. We should not only form a national railway scientific work network in the railway system by combining the research work of professional research institutions, various universities and colleges, and production units, but also, under the leadership of the State Science and Technology Commission, cooperate with relevant parties across the country to organize into a national scientific work network. The Railway Scientific Research Institute should, like the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the national scientific work network, undertake the tasks it should undertake. In the past, people said that the Academy of Sciences was the locomotive in scientific work. In fact, this locomotive should be the Party, and the Academy of Sciences is just a "carriage with luggage," but this carriage has special equipment and service personnel. The Railway Scientific Research Institute should be a smaller special carriage, which is also different from the "carriages" on ordinary railways. The tasks of railway scientific professional research institutions should develop in three directions: first, cutting-edge science and technology; second, major, universal, and key technologies; and third, research on relevant basic theories. This is "grasping three things." The main research work at railway production sites should solve the urgent technical problems in the local area. This is "two responsibilities." All the tasks of "grasping three things" and "two responsibilities" should include summarizing and improving the creations of the masses on the spot and popularizing new technologies on the spot. Of course, the so-called "grasping three things" and "two responsibilities" are not absolute, but only a division of labor in the main directions.

Here, it is worth noting that the task of railway pioneers is as urgent as a shooting star, and various research works are inevitably tense day and night due to close integration with production. However, railway technology is improving all over the world, and our country's railways have many special problems. Although exploratory research work has no direct relationship with current production, once the experiment is successful, it may fundamentally change production conditions and achieve the goal of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Such work should not be lacking in professional research institutions. The needs of the near and distant future should be well combined in research work.

Vice Premier Nie pointed out in his instructions that scientific research should proceed from the tasks of socialist construction. This is another aspect of developing a new road for science. He said, "Use tasks to drive scientific research." That is to say, take tasks as the key link, and take all relevant disciplines as the goal. When the key link is grasped, everything else falls into place, and the research of various disciplines will be driven. The disciplinary system in science has its importance. Through a disciplinary system, a series of related problems in production can be solved, and one example can be used to deduce many others, achieving twice the result with half the effort, which should be valued. However, this must be verified in production practice. To engage in disciplines in isolation from production is to spoil the disciplinary system. At the same time, scientific research on any production problem must integrate all related disciplines. Therefore, disciplines that are closely related to production tasks are more easily popularized and improved. Tasks are both pressure and motivation. This is the inevitability of production promoting science. Therefore, the research method of "tasks driving disciplines" not only has clear goals, can encourage effort, and can organize cooperation in all aspects, but is also an important means of developing science. In railway scientific research, the main task is to be able to coordinate all parties to ensure the completion of the ever-increasing transportation tasks. The goal of railway transportation can be summarized as more loading, faster running, good delivery (delivering the original quality), and saving effort (human, material, and financial resources). These four things can be summarized into one requirement, which is safe high speed, because if the speed of all work can be improved under the condition of ensuring safety, all requirements for transportation will not be difficult to meet. If the speed of the current train can be doubled, our country's railway transportation will be fundamentally changed, and our country's railway science will also catch up with or exceed the world's advanced level. It can be said that this is not a distant matter, and some regions may even take the lead in doing so during the National Day celebrations this year. Therefore, this task requirement of safe high speed is the task within the task, the key link within the key link, and the greatest driving force for the entire plan of railway scientific research. Not only do locomotives and rolling stock need the fastest and newest models, but also all relevant aspects such as lines, bridges, traffic signals, and transportation organization must be transformed accordingly.

The above ideas belong to the requirements of liberating thought and breaking down superstition. This is another aspect of the new road instructed by Vice Premier Nie, and it is also an extremely important aspect. There is no doubt that the Party Central Committee's great call to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, to build socialism with communist spirit, is an incomparably important driving force for scientific research to usher in a great leap forward. The fact that the Railway Scientific Research Institute was able to achieve more than eight years of results in one year is an example. Scientific researchers are often accustomed to working alone, detached from reality, and at the same time blindly believing in books, blindly believing in themselves, and not believing that the masses can engage in scientific research. When the idealist ideology of science is liberated and the mystical view of science is broken, experts and the masses can fight side by side and attack fortresses together. Here, it is more difficult for intellectuals to liberate their minds and break down superstitions than for the masses. For example, the railway "turnouts" that are currently popular in the world have a history of hundreds of years, but they have many shortcomings, and engineers turn a blind eye to them, while our railway workers can successively invent many new types of turnouts, which have a great effect on safe driving at high speeds. Due to historical reasons, our country's railway technical equipment is relatively complex and chaotic, and there are many problems when improving driving speed and carrying out technical transformation. Only on the basis of the new spirit of this new era can we rely on our own efforts to independently solve our own problems.

The four aspects of the new road for developing science proposed by Vice Premier Nie in his instructions are: (1) liberate thought and break down superstition; (2) proceed from the tasks of socialist construction; (3) overall planning; (4) the mass line; which are mutually related and promote each other. Railway scientific research is working hard in these four aspects and advancing along this new road. Therefore, great achievements have been made in 1958, and as experience grows in the future, greater achievements will inevitably be made. We must work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of railway science, and in this crucial year of 1959, we must make unprecedentedly great achievements to present to the Party and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.

    跃进中的铁道科学研究工作
    茅以升
    1958年是我国有史以来最伟大的一年，铁道科学研究工作，也得到空前的大发展。铁道运输业务中出现了惊人数量的科学技术上的创造发明，整个铁道系统中科学研究工作遍地开花，铁路上出现了不少完全自己制造的世界最先进的运输技术装备和自己修建的高度技术的复杂艰巨工程，等等。
    在去年“十一”献礼的展览会上，铁道科学技术成就有六千多件，其中称得起铁路尖端技术的就有四百多件，这些献礼项目是从群众提出的五百多万件的创造发明和合理化建议中选择出来的。这些展品绝大部分是铁道生产现场各单位的贡献，其中极大多数都是为了解决生产中的迫切问题而提出的，但是也有不少是属于高度科学水平及铁路尖端技术性质的。由此可见，科学研究工作在铁路生产现场已经开始出现万马奔腾的局面。这在铁道科学研究的历史上，是个意义极其重大的转折点。从此，研究工作走上了群众路线的社会主义新道路。聂荣臻副总理在“中国科协”成立大会上指出我国科学技术工作发展的道路有四个方面（见“红旗”杂志第九期），其中之一就是群众路线。这在铁道事业一百三十万职工中，已经开始身体力行了。指示中所提出的两个“并举”、三个“结合”，正是铁道科学研究所遵循的新方向。现在，铁路各生产单位正在纷纷设立研究所，铁道学院已从原来的三个发展到三十个，铁道运输和建设工作中广泛开展了科学普及运动，机车车辆修理厂成为制造厂，各工务段办起七百个生产钢铁、水泥、砖瓦等建筑材料的小工厂，机械化自动化运动风起云涌，铁道技术面貌日新月异。今天如此，将来铁道事业什百倍地发展，群众运动对科学研究的作用必将日益重要，而在科学研究成就上，生产现场的比重也必将愈来愈大了。
    在研究工作中，全面规划是非常必要的。铁道科学规划是全国科学规划中的一部分，我们不仅应当在铁道系统中把研究专业机构和各高等学校及生产单位的研究工作组成一个全国性的铁道科学工作网，还应当在国家科学技术委员会领导下，配合全国各有关方面，组织到全国性的科学工作网里去。铁道科学研究院在铁道科学工作网中，应当像中国科学院在全国科学工作网中担负的任务一样，担负起它应担的任务。过去人们把科学院说成是科学工作中的火车头，其实，这个火车头应当是党，科学院还只是一个“带行李”的车辆，不过这个车辆有特殊的设备和服务员而已。铁道科学研究院应当是一个更小型的特殊车辆，它也不同于一般铁路上的“车辆”。铁道科学专业研究机构的任务，应向三个方面发展：一是尖端科学技术，二是重大的普遍的关键性的技术，三是有关基本理论的研究。这是“三抓”。而铁路生产现场的主要研究工作，则应当解决当地当前的急迫技术问题。这是“两当”。所有“三抓”“两当”的任务，都要包括对现场群众创造的总结提高和对新技术在现场的推广普及。当然，所谓“三抓”“两当”并非绝对的，而只是主要方向的分工。
    在这里，值得注意的是，铁路先行官的任务急如星火，各种研究工作由于密切结合生产，也必然是日夜紧张，但是铁路技术全世界都在提高，我国铁路更有许多特殊问题，所谓探索性的研究工作，虽对目前生产还无直接关系，而一旦实验成功，就可能根本改变生产条件，达到更加多快好省的目的。这种工作，在专业研究机构中，还是不能缺少的。近期远期的需要应在研究工作中，很好结合起来。
    聂副总理在指示中提出科学研究要从社会主义建设任务出发，这是发展科学新道路的又一方面。他说，要“用任务来带动科学研究”。这就是说，以任务为纲，把一切有关的学科为目，纲举而目张，各学科的研究就跟着被带动起来。科学上的学科系统是有其重要性的，通过一个学科系统就可解决生产中相关的一系列问题，举一反三，事半功倍，应当予以重视。但是，这是要在生产实践中验证出来的，脱离生产而孤独地搞学科，是对学科系统的糟踏。同时，任何生产问题的科学研究，都要综合起所有相关的学科，因而对生产任务有密切关系的学科，就更易普及和提高。任务既是压力，又是动力，这是生产推动科学的必然性。因此，“任务带学科”的研究方法，不仅目标明确，可鼓干劲，可以组织各方面的协作，而且也是发展科学的一个重要手段。在铁道科学研究中，主要任务是要能协同各方，保证日益增长的运输任务的完成。铁道运输的奋斗目标，可总括为多拉，快跑，好交（交出原来质量）、省力（人力、物力、财力），而这四件事更可总结为一个要求，就是安全的高速度，因为一切工作的速度如果都能在保证安全的条件下提高，所有对运输的要求就不难满足了。如果能把现在火车的速度翻一番，我国的铁道运输就根本改观，而我国的铁道科学也就跟着赶上或超过世界先进水平。可以说，这不是遥远的事，甚至在今年国庆献礼时，就可能有地区抢先做到。因此，这个安全的高速度的任务要求，对铁道科学研究的全部规划来说，就是任务中的任务，纲中之纲，更是带动科学研究的最巨大的动力。不但机车车辆需要最快最新的型式，而且线路、桥梁、行车信号、运输组织等等一切有关方面，都要随着改造。
    以上这些想法，就属于解放思想，破除迷信的要求了。这是聂副总理指示的新道路的另一个方面，也是极重要的一个方面。毫无疑问，党中央的这个敢想敢说敢干的伟大号召，用共产主义精神，建设社会主义，对科学研究来说，是掀起大跃进的无比重要的推动力量。铁道科学研究院所以能在一年内作出超过八年的成绩，就是一个例证。科学研究人员往往习惯于个人单干，脱离实际，同时又迷信书本，迷信自己，不相信群众能搞科学研究。对科学的唯心主义思想解放了，对科学的神秘观点破除了，专家与群众就可并肩作战，齐攻堡垒。在这里，知识分子的解放思想、破除迷信，要比群众困难一些。比如，现在世界通行的铁路“道岔”，已有百年历史，但是缺点很多，工程师们竟视若无睹，而我国铁路工人就能先后发明了多种新型的道岔，对高速度的安全行车有很大作用。我国铁路技术设备，由于历史关系，比较复杂混乱，在提高行车速度进行技术改造时，问题是很多的。只有在这个新时代的新精神基础上，才能自力更生，独立解决我们自己的问题。
    聂副总理指示中所提出的发展科学新道路的四个方面是：（1）解放思想，破除迷信；（2）从社会主义建设任务出发；（3）全面规划；（4）群众路线；是互相联系、彼此促进的。铁道科学研究工作正是在这四方面努力，遵循着这条新道路前进。因此，在1958年就取得了不小成绩，今后经验增长，必然会取得更大的成绩。我们要苦战三年，基本改变铁道科学的面貌，而在1959年的这个具有关键性的一年，更要作出空前巨大的成绩，向党献礼，向建国十周年献礼。
