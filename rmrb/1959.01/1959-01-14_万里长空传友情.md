	Friendship Across the Vast Sky
	Li Zhi
		Drilling before the enemy, flying to different locations, friendship conveyed across the vast sky,
		Our combat friendship is deeper than the sea, with eagles acting as our messengers.
    The weather was exceptionally clear this day. Our unit, under the premise of completing war preparedness tasks, organized a transfer flight training exercise. This transfer flight not only improved the technical skills of our pilots but also greatly strengthened the revolutionary friendship with our old comrades of the ×× unit, who are located far away and whom we had never met before.
    At dawn, each flight crew wrote greetings and gratitude to the leaders and comrades of the old brother unit on the auxiliary fuel tanks of their planes. Some ordnance personnel wrote greetings to the "artillery" (i.e., ordnance), and some crews expressed their feelings for the old brothers in the form of poetry. For example, the crew of plane No. 40 wrote a poem greeting the old brothers:
		The east wind rises, the red flag waves, the sun shines brightly in the vast sky,
		Carrying our heartfelt wishes, we send our greetings to our old brothers.
    Plane No. 45 wrote a poem expressing gratitude to the old brothers:
		Old brothers work responsibly, helping us little brothers with the transfer;
		You all work so hard, we will never forget it.
    Many comrades also instructed the pilots that, after arriving at the fraternal unit, they must convey greetings to the old brothers, hoping to bring their best wishes.
    A few hours after takeoff, our silver eagles returned, laden with the deep feelings of the leaders and comrades of the old brother—the ×× unit. The comrades were extremely excited to see the words of greeting written all over the auxiliary fuel tanks and inside the nozzles of their planes. Therefore, the first task after preparing the planes was to copy these words and the greetings of the flight crews. Among these words were the old brothers' greetings to us, such as:
		Good eagles, good eagles, we add fuel when the eagles come down;
		We guarantee the eagles a safe transfer, and send our regards to you!
    Some expressed our common will to defend the motherland, while others wrote down the old brothers' encouragement and praise for us. For example, there was this poem on plane No. 45:
		Old brothers maintain the planes well, the war eagles are clean and healthy;
		Transfer training is for war preparedness, annihilate more enemy planes and win battles.
    After seeing this, the mechanic Yang Qiancan immediately copied it into his work diary. Then he led all the crew members in wiping down the plane, working even more enthusiastically than usual, making the plane cleaner and more thorough.
    As soon as the leader of the formation, Zhao Yunqing, got off the plane, he excitedly told everyone how warmly the unit leaders and comrades had received them after they arrived at the old brother's place. He said that before leaving, the political commissar insisted that each of them take a large tangerine, and Zhao Yunqing said at the time, "We must bring the tangerines representing the leaders' and comrades' feelings back to our crew comrades." Everyone present felt as if they were there themselves, deeply moved by this kind of intimate care. Some comrades said: We must repay the old brothers' encouragement by doing our jobs well.
    In one of the old brothers' poems, there were these two lines:
		Although the war eagles only stop here briefly, they leave behind deep feelings and friendship.
    Indeed, although it was only a single round trip, the impression it left on us was unforgettable. As Comrade Zhao Yunqing said: "I can't even describe the close unity and revolutionary friendship between our brother units." This feeling of class brotherhood and revolutionary friendship further encourages us to do our work well and defeat the enemy with redoubled confidence.

    万里长空传友情
    李智
        敌前练兵飞转场，万里长空传友情，
        雄鹰为咱作信使，战斗友谊比海深。
    这一天天气特别晴朗。我们部队在完成战备任务的前提下，组织了一次转场飞行训练。这一转场飞行，不但提高了飞行员同志的技术水平，而对于与我们遥遥相隔又从未见过面的老大哥——××部队的革命友谊也大大加强了。
    天刚亮，每个机组就在自己的飞机副油箱上用粉笔写下了向老大哥部队首长和同志们的问候与感谢，有的军械人员写下了向“炮兵”（即军械）的问候，有的机组以诗歌来表达对老大哥的心意。如40号机组写了一首向老大哥的问候诗：
        东风起，红旗飘，万里晴空阳光照，
        带着我们的心意，向老大哥问好。
    45号机写了一首向老大哥的感谢诗：
        大哥工作责任强，帮助小弟转场忙；
        您们工作真辛苦，我们永远不会忘。
    有很多同志还向飞行员交代，要他们到达兄弟部队后，一定要向老大哥问候，谁都希望能把自己的心意带过去。
    起飞几小时后，我们的银燕满载着老大哥——××部队首长和同志们的深情厚意归来了。同志们看到自己飞机的副油箱上和喷管里面都写满了问候的字句，兴奋得不得了，因此在大家准备好飞机后的第一个工作，就是忙着抄录这些字句和机组的问候。在这些字句中，有的是老大哥对我们的问候，如：
        雄鹰好，雄鹰好，雄鹰下来我加料；
        保证雄鹰平安转，捎个话儿问你们好！
    有的表达了我们保卫祖国的共同意志，还有的写下了老大哥对我们的鼓励、表扬。如在45号飞机上有这样一首诗：
        大哥飞机维护强，战鹰清洁又健康；
        转场训练为备战，多歼敌机打胜仗。
    45号机组看了后，机械师杨前灿同志马上把它抄在工作日记上，接着领导全机组人员擦洗飞机，干的比平日更欢，飞机擦的也比平日更清洁、更彻底。
    领队长机赵云清同志一下飞机，就兴高采烈的向大家讲他们到老大哥那儿后，部队首长和同志是如何的热情接待。他说，临走时，政委还一定要他们每个人带一个大桔子，赵云清同志当时表示说“一定把代表首长和同志们情意的桔子带回去给我们的机组同志”。当时在场的每个同志，真有如亲临其境，都为这种亲切的关怀、照顾深深感动。有的同志说：我们要以搞好工作的实际行动，来报答老大哥对我们的这种鼓励。
    在老大哥的一首诗中有这样两句：
    战鹰来此虽一停，留下情长谊又深。
    的确，虽只有这样一个来回，给我们的印象是难忘的。正如赵云清同志所说：“我怎么也形容不尽我们兄弟部队之间的这种亲密团结和革命的友谊。”这种阶级兄弟的感情和革命的友谊，更鼓舞我们信心百倍地去搞好工作，去战胜敌人。
