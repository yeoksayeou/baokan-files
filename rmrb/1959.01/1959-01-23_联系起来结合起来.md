Post-Editing Notes:

    Accumulating and producing fertilizer requires a large amount of labor. How can this be solved given the current labor shortage? In some areas of Hunan Province, various production activities are closely linked with fertilizer accumulation, which not only accumulates fertilizer, but also saves labor and improves production. It's truly a win-win situation.

    In doing work, especially leadership work, we must be good at linking and combining various aspects of work. All regions have some valuable experience in this regard. For example, literacy work is a regular task. In the context of one central task after another, some places combine it with production and with the masses' demand for improving their cultural level, carrying out this work colorfully and persistently throughout the year. Another example is the work of hygiene and eliminating the four pests. Various places adopt a combination of regular and shock campaigns, while also combining this work with fertilizer accumulation and disease prevention, which can be carried out on a large scale nationwide. These facts all illustrate that as long as the work is combined, both the central task and the departmental work can be done at the same time; both the key tasks can be successfully completed, and general work can be carried out incidentally. This is a leadership art. We must learn to combine central and non-central tasks, regular and intensive work. In this way, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Hunan Province's combination of fertilizer accumulation and production is a very good example.

    联系起来结合起来
    积肥造肥需要大量的劳动力，在当前劳力十分紧张的情况下，怎样来解决？湖南省有些地方把各项生产活动和积肥紧密结合起来，既积了肥，也节省了劳力，又搞好了生产。真是一举数得。
    做工作，特别是领导工作，要善于把各方面的工作联系起来，结合起来。各地在这方面都有一些宝贵的经验。譬如，扫盲工作是一项经常性工作，在中心工作一个接一个的情况下，有些地方结合生产，结合群众对提高文化的要求，把这项工作开展得有声有色，坚持全年。又如讲卫生除四害的工作，各地采用经常和突击运动相结合，同时把这项工作和积肥、预防疾病相结合，就能在全国范围内大规模地开展起来。这些事实都说明，只要把工作结合起来，在同一时间，既能做好中心工作，也能做好部门工作；既能胜利地完成重点工作，也能附带着开展一般工作。这是一种领导艺术。我们一定要学会把中心工作和非中心工作，经常性工作和突击性工作结合起来。这样就可以事半功倍。湖南省把积肥和生产结合起来，就是很好的一例。
