Xinhua News Agency, 30th – "Resolutely fulfill and overfulfill the plan for the first ten days of February, adhere to production until the last minute before the Spring Festival holiday, have a good rest during the Spring Festival, and strive for a flying start with full attendance on the first day of work after the Spring Festival." This is the battle cry put forward by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC at a meeting held on the 29th to arrange work for February.

As of the 30th, 127 factories and mines in Beijing have completed their January production plans. Some enterprises mobilized workers to discuss the production plan for January of this year at the end of last year and formulated specific measures to achieve the plan. The workers had confidence and were full of energy. For example, the Liulihe Cement Plant mobilized the masses to discuss the production plans for the first quarter and January of this year at the end of last year. In January, the plant's Party committee specifically focused on the ten-day and daily plans. The plant's January plan was completed four days ahead of schedule on the 27th. The Party Committee Secretary and the Director of the Jingxi Mining Bureau personally took charge at the beginning of this year, went to various mines to check production, and mobilized the masses to organize high-yield days, so that the daily coal output generally reached about 16,000 tons, and the highest reached 17,000 tons, equivalent to the actual level of late December last year. It is estimated that this mine's coal production plan for January can be overfulfilled.

The meeting pointed out that now that January is coming to an end, all factories and mines in the city must continue to exert their energy, seize the time to arrange production for February. The method is to launch a vigorous mass movement, hand over the plan to the masses for discussion, and create a lively and vigorous atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward to ensure the early and overfulfillment of the February production plan. He said that, based on the experience of last year and January of this year, in addition to launching a large-scale mass movement, all units must also vigorously grasp production, grasp it early and tightly, and strengthen specific leadership. All units that have the conditions should formulate ten-day plans and daily plans, and conscientiously check the completion of the ten-day plans and daily plans.

The meeting believed that a year's plan lies in spring, and February has only twenty-eight days, and the Spring Festival is also in this month. If the February plan is completed well, it will lay a good foundation for completing the entire first quarter production plan. All units should earnestly do a good job in equipment maintenance and all preparations before production during the Spring Festival to ensure that employees can immediately put into production after the Spring Festival. The meeting called on all employees in the city to immediately mobilize, muster greater revolutionary energy, continue to strive for excellence, and struggle to comprehensively complete the February production plan in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    春节前坚持生产不松劲  春节后争取全勤开门红
    中共北京市委号召全面完成二月份计划
    新华社30日讯　“坚决完成和超额完成2月上旬的计划，春节前要坚持生产到放假前最后一分钟，春节期间要好好休息，春节后开工第一天争取全勤生产开门红”。这是中共北京市委在29日召开的布置2月份工作的会议上提出的战斗号召。
    到30日止，北京市已有一百二十七个厂矿企业完成了1月份生产计划。有些企业在去年年底就发动职工讨论了今年1月份的生产计划，并制定了实现计划的具体措施，职工们心中有底，干劲十足。如琉璃河水泥厂去年年底就发动群众讨论了今年第一季度和1月份的生产计划，1月份，厂的党委又具体抓旬计划、日计划，全厂1月份的计划已在27日提前四天完成。京西矿务局党委书记和局长在今年一开始就亲自挂帅，分赴各矿检查生产情况，发动群众组织高产日，使煤的日产量一般达到一万六千吨左右，最高达到一万七千吨，相当于去年12月下旬的实际水平，预计这个矿1月份的产煤计划可以超额完成。
    会议指出，现在1月份即将结束，全市各厂矿企业必须继续鼓足干劲，抓紧时间安排2月份的生产，办法是大搞群众运动，把计划交给群众讨论，造成轰轰烈烈有声有色的大跃进气氛，保证提前超额完成2月份生产计划。他说，根据去年和今年1月份的经验，除大搞群众运动外，各单位还必须狠狠地抓生产，要抓得早，抓得紧，加强具体领导。凡是有条件的单位，都要订出旬计划、日计划，并且要认真地检查旬计划和日计划的完成情况。
    会议认为，一年之计在于春，2月份只有二十八天，春节又在这个月内。2月份计划完成得好，就为完成整个第一季度的生产计划打下很好的基础。各单位应在春节期间切实做好设备维护和生产前的一切准备工作，以保证职工能够在春节后立刻投入生产。会议号召全市职工立即动员起来，鼓起更大的革命干劲，继续力争上游，为多快好省地全面完成2月份生产计划而斗争。
