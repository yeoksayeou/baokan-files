　　Gromyko Points Out at the CPSU Congress
　　The Soviet Union Steadily Holds the Initiative in Diplomacy
　　Imperialism Will Suffer an Unprecedented Defeat in History If It Launches a New War
　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the afternoon of the 29th.
　　He emphasized that the theses of Khrushchev's report to the 21st CPSU Congress, published last November, had a significant stabilizing effect on the overall international situation.
　　Gromyko then said that Westerners have recognized the fact that a country striving to become the world's number one in industrial production desires peace. Due to the strengthening of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, launching a new world war is less of a risk and more of an impossibility. Gromyko then emphasized that this provided a new and more solid foundation for the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful coexistence. Gromyko said that the peaceful policies pursued by the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries have had a new impact on the fate of the world.
　　Gromyko mentioned some of the peaceful steps taken by the Soviet government recently aimed at easing international tensions. He said that Western countries have not shown a willingness to welcome the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals on issues such as convening a summit meeting. They have spent a lot of energy and effort to avoid convening this meeting.
　　Gromyko said that the current policies of Western countries reflect their undiminished hope of trying to reverse the course of history. Gromyko said that non-recognition of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic is a reflection of this policy. Gromyko then said that the time may come when the United States and other countries, which are ignoring the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, will have to invite People's China to sit at the table.
　　Speaking of the German question, Gromyko particularly emphasized the danger to the fate of peace of the plan to arm West Germany with atomic weapons. Gromyko pointed out that equipping West Germany with atomic and rocket weapons will not only fail to guarantee its security, but will instead reduce its security. Even West German Defense Minister Strauss, who is particularly active in advocating the arming of the Bundeswehr with atomic weapons, does not dare to deny the fact that the cities of the Federal Republic of Germany, farthest from the Soviet Union, are still much closer than the moon.
　　Gromyko then emphasized that the most important aspect of the German question is the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the abolition of the occupation regime in West Berlin.
　　Gromyko said that when US Secretary of State Dulles spoke on this issue at a press conference two days ago, he resorted to concealment and threats of war. Gromyko said that if a new war breaks out, there will only be one result: the defeat of the aggressor, and this defeat will be an unprecedented defeat in history.
　　Gromyko then said that the Soviet Union is now willing to reach an agreement on the German question. However, if an agreement cannot be reached through no fault of our own, then the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will seek other ways to resolve this issue.
　　Gromyko then said that the same should be true of the Berlin issue. The Soviet Union is sincerely seeking a solution to this issue, and if a unified solution cannot be found, then the Soviet Union will implement the established measures that everyone knows, in accordance with the agreement with the German Democratic Republic. He said that no one should miscalculate on this point.
　　Gromyko also pointed out that Adenauer is the first to oppose every peaceful initiative of the Soviet Union. He said, "We do not consider Germany to be our enemy, and we are not prepared to take revenge on them. But if West German militarists launch a war of aggression, then we will not only settle new accounts with them, but also settle old accounts."
　　Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet Union has firmly grasped the initiative in international affairs. The Soviet Union has put forward many peaceful proposals and taken a series of diplomatic actions. Gromyko pointed out that the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov caused great harm to Soviet foreign policy. The Central Committee of the Party promptly purged this factional group and is currently paying great attention to foreign policy issues.
　　Gromyko then said that this is a reliable guarantee that Soviet foreign policy is in line with the interests of all Soviet people. Now, all Soviet people are striving for new and more outstanding achievements not only on the front of national economic construction, but also on the road to saving mankind from the threat of war.

### 葛罗米柯在苏共代表大会上指出  苏联在外交上稳握主动权  帝国主义如发动新战争必遭历史上空前失败

    葛罗米柯在苏共代表大会上指出
    苏联在外交上稳握主动权
    帝国主义如发动新战争必遭历史上空前失败
    据新华社讯　苏联外交部长葛罗米柯29日下午在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上发言。
    他强调指出，在去年11月发表过的赫鲁晓夫向苏共第二十一次代表大会的报告提纲对整个国际局势产生了显著的稳定性的影响。
    葛罗米柯接着说，西方人士已经认识到这样一个事实：一个努力争取使工业产品生产占世界第一位的国家是希望和平的。由于苏联和社会主义阵营各国力量的加强，发动新的世界大战与其说是冒险，不如说是不可能。葛罗米柯接着强调指出，这样就使苏联所主张的和平共处政策有了新的更加牢固的基础。葛罗米柯说，中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家所奉行的和平政策对全世界命运产生了新的影响。
    葛罗米柯提到苏联政府最近时期所采取的旨在缓和国际紧张局势的一些和平步骤。他说，但是西方国家像在召开高级会议这样的问题上并没有表现出欢迎苏联这种和平建议的愿望。它们花了不小的气力和心思来逃避召开这一会议。
    葛罗米柯说，西方国家目前的政策反映了它们还没有打消力图倒转历史车轮的希望。葛罗米柯说，不承认中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国就是这种政策的一种反映。葛罗米柯接着说，但是，忽视中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的美国和其他国家不得不请人民中国坐到一张桌子上来的时候也许就要到来。
    葛罗米柯在谈到德国问题时，特别强调指出了用原子武器武装西德的计划对和平命运的危险性。葛罗米柯指出，西德配备原子武器和火箭武器，不但不能够保障它的安全，而相反地还会减少它的安全。甚至特别积极主张用原子武器武装联邦国防军的西德国防部长施特劳斯也不敢否认这一事实，即离苏联最远的德意志联邦共和国的城市同月球比起来还是要近得多。
    葛罗米柯接着强调指出，德国问题最重要的方面就是缔结对德和约和取消西柏林的占领制度。
    葛罗米柯说，美国国务卿杜勒斯两天前在记者招待会上谈到这一问题时采取了欲盖弥彰和以战争相威胁的办法。葛罗米柯说，如果发生新战争，结果只有一个，这就是侵略者的失败，而且这种失败是历史上空前的失败。
    葛罗米柯接着说，苏联现在就愿意在德国问题上达成协议。但是，如果并非因我们的过错而未能达成协议时，那么苏联和其他社会主义国家将另谋解决这一问题的办法。
    葛罗米柯接着说，在柏林问题上也应该是这样的。苏联是真诚谋求解决这一问题的，如果不能找到一致解决这一问题的办法，那么苏联就要根据同德意志民主共和国的协议实行大家都知道的既定措施。他说，谁也不要在这一点上打错算盘。
    葛罗米柯还指出阿登纳对苏联每一个和平倡议都是第一个反对者。他说，我们并不认为德国是我们的敌人，我们也不准备向他们复仇。但是西德军国主义者要发动侵略战争的话，那我们就不但要向他们算新账，而且要算旧账。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联在国际事务上已经稳稳地掌握了主动权，苏联提出了许多和平的建议，采取了一系列的外交行动。葛罗米柯谈到这里时指出，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团给苏联外交政策造成了很大的危害。党中央委员会及时地清除了这一宗派主义分子集团，并且目前对外交政策问题给予非常大的注意。
    葛罗米柯接着说，这是苏联外交政策符合全体苏联人民利益的可靠保证。现在，全体苏联人民不仅在国民经济建设战线上，而且在挽救人类免于战争威胁的道路上正在争取新的更加杰出的成就。
