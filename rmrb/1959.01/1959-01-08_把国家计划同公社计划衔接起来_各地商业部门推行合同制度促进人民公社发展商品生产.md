Integrate National Plans with Commune Plans
Commercial Departments in Various Regions Implement Contract Systems to Promote Commodity Production in People's Communes
Longchang County, Sichuan, Signs Over Fifty Purchase and Sale Contracts, Greatly Activating the Economic Life of the County's People's Communes

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Commercial departments in many regions are fully playing the role of "staff headquarters" in helping people's communes develop commodity production.

Commercial departments generally start by signing purchase and sale contracts or participating in the formulation of diversified economic development plans for the people's communes. Through purchase and sale contracts, they further connect the communes' diversified economic development plans with the national acquisition plans, greatly strengthening the planning of commodity production. The Phoenix County Commercial Bureau in Hunan Province, during the process of signing contracts with communes, helped them find seventeen new avenues for developing diversified economies, such as paper pulp. The state needs a lot of paper pulp, and the local area has abundant resources. The commune originally had no plans, but after the commercial department made suggestions, the entire county decided to build thirteen new paper pulp factories with an annual output of two million catties of paper pulp. The commercial department also suggested that the commune increase the planting of one hundred mu of jute and reduce the planting of individual varieties that are not very marketable, making the plan more realistic. This contract system is currently being implemented in many regions across the country. In Henan Province alone, the commercial departments of Puyang, Qingfeng, Hua County, Changyuan, Jiyuan, Huojia, and six other counties have signed more than five thousand contracts with communes.

After participating in the formulation of production plans for the people's communes, commercial departments immediately provided assistance in terms of seeds, raw materials, funds, and technology. In Lushan County, Henan Province, commercial departments at all levels dispatched more than three hundred cadres to specialize in helping communes engage in commodity production, training more than nine hundred technical personnel for the communes, and setting prices for more than eight hundred new commodities in accordance with national price policies, ensuring that there is a price for every product. At the same time, they ensured that whatever production needs is supplied, and whatever is produced is purchased, and that processing and transportation are done in a timely manner to accelerate commodity circulation. With the strong support of the commercial departments, Lushan County had established more than one thousand seven hundred factories and farms for raising poultry and livestock and processing silk, oil, and paper by early December of last year, and cultivated more than one hundred and eighty production bases for various mountain products and medicinal materials.

The Finance and Trade Department of Qin County, Shanxi Province, has created an effective method to promote the diversified economic development of communes. They established a diversified economic demonstration zone in the county center, placed "flags" of diversified economy in larger market towns, and developed eighty-three diversified economic "points" in production brigades with better conditions in each commune, forming a network for developing a diversified economy centered on the demonstration zone. This demonstration zone was established by employees transferred from the Finance and Trade Department. Currently, it has established sixteen factories and twelve breeding farms, and planted fourteen kinds of fruit trees and nineteen kinds of cash crops. It not only accumulates management experience and cultivates technical talents for developing a diversified economy, but also sets an example for the development of a diversified economy throughout the county.

The Jingxi County Commercial Department in Guangxi adopted the method of assisting people's communes in organizing professional teams to develop sideline production. With the assistance of the commercial department, the Jingxi People's Commune has established a sideline production team of four hundred and eighty people, and has set up three sow breeding farms and Wanji Mountain, a rabbit farm, and a dairy farm. The establishment of this kind of sideline production professional team makes it easier for the Party committee to strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan sideline production according to local conditions, and unify the arrangement of labor, while also facilitating the promotion and exchange of advanced experience.

After some advanced areas developed commodity production, the income of the communes increased, the needs of the state were met, and the purchase and sale business of the commercial departments also became active. Liangjiatai Store in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, which has always paid attention to developing a diversified economy in mountainous areas, helped the commune march towards three hundred kinds of cash crops last year, increasing the commune's income by 1,375,000 yuan. The store's business also became increasingly active, with the types of goods it handled increasing from seventeen in 1953 to eight hundred and twenty-five, and the purchase amount skyrocketing from 20,000 yuan to 672,000 yuan. It also exceeded the annual acquisition and sales tasks by more than 20% forty-eight days ahead of schedule, and the annual profit plan was also exceeded by 8% ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th: How to implement the contract system and promote diversified economic development after the people's communes were established is an important issue in current commercial work. The commercial department of Longchang County, Sichuan Province, has set a good example in this regard.

As of now, the commercial department of Longchang County has signed fifty-five purchase and sale contracts with all the people's communes in the county. According to the contract provisions: in the first and second quarters of 1959, the commercial department will pre-purchase sixty-one kinds of products from the commune, with a total amount of 12.9 million yuan; and supply the commune with seventy-eight kinds of materials, with a total amount of 7.26 million yuan. Through the signing of the contract, the national procurement plan and the commune production plan were further linked.

Now both sides are working hard to realize the plan of the contract. All communes have arranged production according to the content of the contract. For example, the several major products planned to be produced by the Hujia People's Commune will develop to more than 233,000 pigs, 20,000 sheep, and an average of fifteen chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits per person. The output of other products will also be greatly increased compared to last year. After the contract was signed, the County Commercial Bureau supplied the commune with 200 boxes of improved varieties of bees, 123,000 fruit tree seedlings, 210,000 various forest tree seedlings, 40,000 various medicinal herb seedlings, and 750,000 jin of oil crop seeds, and trained more than 480 technicians, so that every production team in the county has technical personnel.

The active support and participation of the commercial department in the commune's production plan has helped the commune to widely open up production avenues, and has powerfully promoted the development of a diversified economy. According to preliminary statistics from six communes, such as Hujia and Xinhua, twenty-three new varieties of production have been opened up, such as bees, and thirty-three varieties have been restored and increased in production, such as cotton thread, sugar cane, and fish. Even the production arrangements for many small local specialties, such as brooms, straw sandals, and raincoats, are now on the agenda of the commune Party committee. In the past, many women in Longchang County were engaged in hemp thread production. Last year, due to the tension in agricultural production, most women were put into agricultural labor, so the output of hemp thread was greatly reduced, and the raw materials for summer cloth production could not be solved, affecting the completion of the commodity production task. Now, according to the provisions of the contract, the commune has made appropriate arrangements to organize women to spin hemp for a certain period of time.

The signing of the contract guarantees the realization of the policy of giving equal importance to the commune's self-sufficiency production and commodity production, so that the needs of the state and the commune are appropriately met. For example, Hujia Commune has planted 1,800 mu of vegetables, of which 800 mu are for the consumption of the commune members, and 1,000 mu are for the supply of cities and industrial and mining areas.

The contract system enables the commercial department to more systematically promote products and supply materials for the commune. In the past, the commercial department did not know what the commune needed, what to promote, how much was needed, and how much to promote. After participating in production planning and accounting, the commercial department can directly deliver materials to the production team according to the number, and at the same time, they can make arrangements for quality, specifications, and specific time as early as possible.

Before signing the contract, the county Party committee and the commune Party committees had conducted political and ideological education for the commercial department and commune cadres, overcoming the right-leaning conservative ideas of some cadres. Originally, some cadres in the finance and trade department believed that the development of a diversified economy was a matter for the agricultural department, and had nothing to do with the finance and trade department, so why bother to run training classes, find seeds, and sign contracts, looking for trouble; some cadres in the commune were also afraid that the development of a diversified economy would occupy cultivated land and affect grain income; when arranging specific varieties, they wanted to engage in more good and valuable varieties, but did not take care of the overall needs; they were also afraid that after being included in the contract, it would affect the needs of the commune; some cadres were afraid that too many sideline products would be produced and could not be sold. In response to these ideas, the commune Party committees promptly carried out education on how to correctly treat the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and carried out airing of views and debates through accounting of grain, labor, improvement of commune members' lives, and the accounting of immediate and long-term interests, so that the cadres clarified the necessity of developing a diversified economy, and the development must have a positive and reliable contract as a guarantee. The commercial department also stated that it will purchase as much as the commune produces.

In order to ensure that the contract has a reliable basis, the commercial department of Longchang County conducted a ranking of local products before signing the contract with each commune, and organized the relevant departments of the commune to fully discuss. Find out which ones are currently produced in large quantities, which ones were produced in the past but are currently interrupted, and which ones are new products, and at the same time, calculate the seven accounts of land, manpower, seeds, varieties, quantity, time, and income. Arrange the five combinations: the combination of large and small items, the combination of large-scale development and general development, the combination of national needs and the commune's self-production and self-use, the combination of large and small income, and the combination of long-term income and immediate income. The county Party committee conducted unified leadership and arrangements for the signing of contracts between the commercial department and the commune; many commune Party committee secretaries personally participated in accounting for the details, and reviewed the varieties and quantities stipulated in the contract.

In order to ensure that the contract can be realized on time, the commercial department of Longchang County helped the commune to make plans for developing a diversified economy while signing contracts with the commune, organized the supply of raw materials and seeds, and provided technical guidance; in addition, it strengthened business management, often paid attention to checking the implementation of plans and contracts, and paid attention to the "combination of near and far", that is, in signing contracts, it not only focused on the current needs for supply and promotion, but also appropriately signed some longer-term contracts based on the commune's long-term plan.

    把国家计划同公社计划衔接起来
    各地商业部门推行合同制度促进人民公社发展商品生产
    四川隆昌县签订五十多份购销合同，使全县人民公社经济生活大大活跃
    据新华社7日讯　不少地区商业部门在帮助人民公社发展商品生产中，充分发挥了“参谋部”的作用。
    商业部门一般都从签订购销合同或者参与人民公社制订多种经济的发展规划入手，通过购销合同把人民公社发展多种经济的规划和国家收购计划进一步地衔接起来，使商品生产的计划性大大加强。湖南凤凰县商业局在与公社签订合同的过程中，帮助公社找到了十七个发展多种经济的新门路，如纸浆，国家很需要，当地又有丰富的资源，公社原来没有计划，商业部门提出建议后，全县就决定新建纸浆厂十三个，年产纸浆二百万斤。商业部门还建议公社增种黄麻一百亩，并且核减了个别不大畅销的品种，使计划更切合实际。目前这种合同制度已在全国不少地区推行，仅河南省濮阳、清丰、滑县、长垣、济源、获嘉等八个县的商业部门，就与公社签订了五千多份合同。
    商业部门在参与人民公社制订生产规划以后，立即从种子、原料、资金、技术等方面给以援助。河南鲁山县各级商业部门抽出三百多个干部专门帮助公社搞商品生产，帮助公社训练各种技术人员九百多人，并且按照国家价格政策订出八百多种新商品的价格，做到了有货就有价，同时做到生产需要啥供应啥，生产多少收购多少，而且及时加工、及时调运，加速商品流转。在商业部门的大力扶持下，鲁山县到去年12月上旬已先后建立起饲养家禽家畜和加工丝绸、油料、纸张的厂场一千七百多个，培植了各种山货、药材生产基地一百八十多处。
    山西沁县财贸部门促进公社发展多种经济中，创造了一套有效办法。他们在县中心建立多种经济示范区，较大集镇安插多种经济的“旗”，在各公社条件较好的生产大队发展了八十三个多种经济的“点”，以示范区为中心组成了发展多种经济的网。这个示范区由财贸部门抽调职工建立，目前已办起了十六个工厂、十二个饲养场，种植了十四种果树和十九种经济作物，它不仅为发展多种经济积累管理经验，培养技术人材，而且为全县发展多种经济树立了榜样。
    广西靖西县商业部门采取协助人民公社组织专业队伍的办法来发展副业生产。在商业部门协助下，靖西人民公社已经建立起一支拥有四百八十人的副业生产队伍，办起了三个母猪繁殖场和万鸡山、兔子场、牛奶场。这种副业生产专业队的成立，便于党委加强领导，便于因地制宜全面规划副业生产和统一安排劳动力，同时也有利于推广和交流先进经验。
    部分先进地区发展商品生产以后，公社收入增加了，国家需要得到满足，商业部门的购销业务也随着活跃起来。一贯注意发展山区多种经济的河北青龙县亮甲台商店，去年在协助公社向三百种经济作物进军以后，使公社增加收入一百三十七万五千元。商店的业务也日益活跃，经营品种由1953年的十七种增加到八百二十五种，采购金额由二万元猛增到六十七万二千元，并且提前四十八天超额20％多完成了全年收购和销售任务，全年的利润计划也超额8％提前完成。
    新华社成都7日电　人民公社化以后，如何推行合同制度，促进多种经济发展，是当前商业工作中的一个重要问题。四川省隆昌县商业部门在这方面做出了良好榜样。
    截至目前为止，隆昌县商业部门已与全县各人民公社签订了五十五份购销合同。根据合同规定：1959年一、二季度商业部门向公社预购产品六十一种，总金额达一千二百九十万元；供应公社物资七十八种，总金额七百二十六万余元。通过合同的签订，国家收购计划和公社生产计划便进一步衔接起来。
    现在双方都在为实现合同的规划而努力。各公社已按合同的内容安排生产。如胡家人民公社计划生产的几种主要产品，生猪将发展到二十三万三千多头，羊二万头，鸡、鸭、鹅、兔达到每人平均十五只，其他产品的产量也比去年大大增加。县商业局在合同签订以后，已经供应了公社良种蜜蜂二百箱、果树苗一十二万三千株、各种林木苗二十一万株、各种药材种苗四万株、油料作物种子七十五万斤，并训练了技术员四百八十多人，使全县各个生产队都有技术手。
    商业部门积极支持和参与公社的生产规划，已帮助公社广开生产门路，有力地促进了多种经济的发展。据胡家、新华等六个公社初步统计，新开辟生产的品种有蜜蜂等二十三种，恢复和增产的品种有棉线、甘蔗、鱼等三十三种。连很多小土特产如扫帚、草鞋、蓑衣等的生产安排，现在都列入公社党委的议事日程上了。过去隆昌县不少妇女从事麻线生产，去年由于农业生产紧张，妇女大都投入农业劳动，因而麻线产量大大减少，夏布生产原料无法解决，影响商品生产任务的完成。现在公社根据合同的规定，已作适当安排，以一定时间组织妇女绩麻。
    合同的签订，保证了公社自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举方针的实现，使国家和公社的需要都得到适当的满足。比如胡家公社已种植一千八百亩地蔬菜，其中八百亩蔬菜供本社社员食用，一千亩蔬菜供应城市和工矿区。
    合同制度可以使商业部门更有计划地为公社推销产品和供应物资。过去商业部门对公社需要什么，推销什么，需要多少，推销多少，心中不是很有数的。经过参加生产规划和算账，商业部门可以直接按数把物资送到生产队，同时在质量、规格、具体时间上都能及早进行安排。
    在签订合同以前，县党委和各公社党委曾经对商业部门和公社干部进行了政治思想教育，克服了某些干部的右倾保守思想。原来，财贸部门有些干部认为多种经济的发展是农业部门的事情，与财贸部门无关，何必办训练班、找种籽、签合同，自找麻烦；公社也有些干部怕多种经济的发展占去耕地面积，影响粮食收入；在安排具体品种时，对好搞的值钱的，想多搞，不照顾全面的需要；又怕纳入合同后影响公社需要；还有的干部怕副业产品生产多了卖不掉。针对这些思想，各公社党委及时进行了如何正确地对待国家、集体、个人之间的关系的教育，并通过算粮食账、劳力账、社员生活改善账、眼前利益和长远利益账，开展鸣放、辩论，使干部们明确了发展多种经济的必要，以及发展中必须要有积极可靠的合同作保证。商业部门也表示：公社生产多少就收购多少。
    为了使合同有可靠的根据，隆昌县商业部门在与各公社签订合同之前，都对当地产品情况进行了排队，并组织公社有关部门充分讨论。找出那些是现在大量生产的，那些是过去生产而目前中断的，那些是新产品，同时算好土地、人力、种籽、品种、数量、时间、收入七笔账。安排好五结合：大宗与小宗相结合、成片发展与普遍发展相结合、国家需要与公社自产自用相结合、收入大的与收入小的相结合、多年才有收益的与当年就有收益的相结合。县委对于商业部门与公社签订合同，进行了统一领导和安排；很多公社党委书记亲自参加算细账，并审查了合同中规定的品种和数量。
    为了保证合同能如期实现，隆昌县商业部门在和公社订合同时一面帮助公社作发展多种经济的规划，组织原料、种籽供应，在技术上进行指导；此外还加强经营管理，经常注意检查规划和合同执行的情况，并注意“远近结合”，就是在签订合同中既抓当前需要供应和推销的，也根据公社的远景规划，适当签订一些较长远的合同。
