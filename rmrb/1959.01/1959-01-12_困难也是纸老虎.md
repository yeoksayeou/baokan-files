Difficulties are Also Paper Tigers
Liu Di

Reading the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, I was reminded of Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers when I read that we should strategically despise difficulties but tactically take them seriously. Difficulties are also paper tigers.

On our road forward, large and small difficulties are common. They are like tigers blocking the road, obstructing people's way. However, looking back at the long road we have travelled, we have overcome one difficulty after another; we have trampled one blocking tiger after another under our feet. The blocking tigers have turned into paving stones; difficulties have been transformed into steps for our advancement. Why is this so? There are many reasons. One of them is that we have adopted Chairman Mao's attitude of strategically despising all difficulties and tactically taking all difficulties seriously, which is a strategic idea that guarantees victory in every battle. Under the guidance of this idea, we have forged ahead and achieved one victory after another; relying on this ideological weapon, we have also achieved brilliant results in our struggle against nature.

A revolutionary must make revolution. Revolution against imperialism and all reactionaries, and also revolution against all kinds of difficulties. Therefore, we first of all despise all difficulties from the overall and long-term point of view. No matter how great the difficulties are in front of us, we have no fear. Not only are we not afraid, but we also despise them, and overcome them with an indomitable iron will and a majestic spirit. This is not an easy task either. This requires us to always be filled with a hundredfold courage and confidence in the revolutionary cause, to work with soaring enthusiasm and passion, to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and to firmly believe in and rely on the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, this heroic spirit of revolutionaries has been greatly developed among the broad masses of the people. Under the leadership of the Party, the people have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, become energetic, and fought with high morale. From this, the infinite power to overcome difficulties has been generated. The facts of the past year are the best proof. Those 10.7 million tons of steel and 750 billion jin of grain also confirm this truth. Is it difficult to produce 10.7 million tons of steel annually? It is difficult, but we despise it. We adopted the principle of taking steel as the key link, combined indigenous and foreign methods, and launched a mass steelmaking campaign. As a result, we smelted it out furnace by furnace. Is it difficult to double grain production? It is difficult, and we despised it too, and finally doubled grain production. This is called knowing the difficulties and advancing. In the face of the facts, those "head-shaking factions" who feared difficulties could not but nod, and the "accounting factions" could not but admit defeat. It was like this last year, why can't it be like this this year!

Strategically despising all difficulties is not based on unfounded delusions. Where is the basis? The basis lies in our mastery of the objective laws of the development of things, and in our giving play to our subjective initiative. We are materialists, we believe that society is bound to develop forward, and that difficulties are only temporary phenomena in the process of progress, and that new things will always triumph. Our great ambitions are based on the inevitable result of the development of this objective law. Difficulties can be completely transformed into smooth progress, which is why we despise all difficulties.

While we strategically despise all difficulties, we also tactically take all difficulties seriously. A "paper tiger" is not born of paper, it only becomes paper after people despise it and defeat it. Before that, it is always a tiger. Since it is a tiger, we need to carefully and specifically study the strategy of fighting the tiger. From an overall point of view, difficulties cannot prevent us from winning; but specific difficulties often reduce our speed of progress and cause us to suffer losses. Therefore, we must have a scientific attitude of taking difficulties seriously, and we must have specific ways to overcome difficulties. Difficulties will not naturally turn into smooth progress; this requires people's subjective efforts. This means scientifically analyzing unfavorable and favorable factors, turning unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, understanding all aspects of contradictions, and then finding clever ways to promote the transformation of difficulties into smooth progress. Look far ahead, take solid steps, overcome difficulties one by one, and move towards victory step by step.

To despise and take difficulties seriously is precisely our dialectical and Marxist attitude towards things. Lacking one aspect, it is impossible to move forward. Strategically despising all difficulties is our fundamental difference with right-leaning opportunists; tactically taking all difficulties seriously is our fundamental difference with "left"-leaning opportunists. We must have both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of scientific analysis; we must both oppose conservatism, break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and oppose exaggeration, seek truth from facts, and work hard and skillfully; we must have both full enthusiasm and a calm mind. In this way, we will be invincible, and all difficulties must raise their hands in surrender!

### 困难也是纸老虎

    困难也是纸老虎
    柳笛
    读党的八届六中全会公报，读到要在战略上藐视困难，又要在战术上重视困难，不由地想起了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。困难，也是纸老虎。
    在我们前进的路上，大大小小的困难是常见的，它们就像拦路虎，拦住人们的去路。但是，回过头来看一看我们走过的漫长的道路上，一重重的困难，被我们战胜了；一个个的拦路虎，被我们踏在脚下了。拦路的虎，变成了铺路的砖石；困难，转化成了我们前进的阶梯。为什么会这样？原因有很多。其中一条就是，我们对困难采取了毛主席指出的在战略上藐视一切困难、在战术上重视一切困难的态度，这是一个百战百胜的战略思想。在这样的思想指导下，我们勇往直前，取得了一个接一个的胜利；依靠这一思想武器，我们在和自然作斗争中，也已经取得了辉煌的成绩。
    革命者就是要革命。革帝国主义和一切反动派的命，也革各种各样困难的命。所以我们首先从全局和长远观点上藐视一切困难，天大的困难摆在面前，都毫无惧色。不仅不惧，还要藐视它，以大无畏的钢铁意志和气吞山河的气概战胜它。这也不是一件容易的事。这需要对革命事业始终充沛着百倍的勇气和信心，干劲冲天，热情澎湃，敢想敢说敢做，坚信群众和依靠群众。大跃进以来，这种革命者的英雄气概已经在广大人民群众中大大发扬起来了。人民群众在党的领导下，破除迷信、解放思想，精神焕发，斗志昂扬。从这里，产生了克服困难的无穷威力。去年一年的事实，是再好不过的证人了。那一千零七十万吨钢和七千五百亿斤粮食，也证实了这个道理。年产一千零七十万吨钢难不难？难，但是我们藐视它，来了个以钢为纲，土洋并举，全民大炼钢铁，结果一炉一炉地把它炼出来了；粮食产量翻一番难不难？难，我们也藐视它，结果终于把粮食产量翻了上去。这叫做知难而进。在事实面前，那些惧怕困难的“摇头派”不能不点头了，“算账派”不能不服输了。去年是这样，今年又何尝不能这样！
    在战略上藐视一切困难，并不是出于无根据的妄想。根据在哪里？根据就在我们掌握了事物发展的客观规律，又发挥了主观能动作用。我们是唯物主义者，我们相信社会是必然向前发展的，困难不过是前进过程中的暂时现象，新生的事物总要战胜。我们的雄心大志就建立在这种客观规律发展的必然结果上。困难完全可以向顺利转化，这就是我们藐视一切困难的理由。
    我们在战略上藐视一切困难，但同时又在战术上重视一切困难。“纸老虎”并非天生是纸的，只是在人们藐视它而且战胜它之后，它才成了纸的。在这以前，它总是个虎。既然是个虎，就需要认真具体地研究打虎的对策。从整体上看，困难并不能阻挡我们胜利；但是具体的困难常常会减低我们前进的速度，使我们遭受损失。因此，我们就要有重视困难的科学态度，要有克服困难的具体办法。困难是不会自然而然地向顺利转化的，这需要加上人们的主观努力。这就是科学地分析不利和有利因素，把不利条件变为有利条件，摸清矛盾的各个方面，然后找出巧干的办法，促使困难向顺利转化。眼光看得远大，步子走得踏实，一个一个地克服困难，一步一步地走向胜利。
    对困难既藐视，又重视，这正是我们辩证地对待事物的马克思主义态度。缺了一面，都是无法前进的。在战略上藐视一切困难，这是我们同右倾机会主义者的根本分歧；在战术上重视一切困难，这又是我们同“左”倾机会主义者的根本分歧。既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学分析的精神；既要反对保守、破除迷信、敢想敢说敢干，又要反对浮夸，实事求是，实干苦干巧干；既要有饱满的热情，又要有冷静的头脑。这样我们就会所向披靡，永远立于不败之地，一切困难都必须举起双手来投降！
