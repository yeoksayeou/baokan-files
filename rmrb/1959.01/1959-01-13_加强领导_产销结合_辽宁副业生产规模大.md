Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: People's communes in various parts of Liaoning Province, while engaged in farmland water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, have also drawn some labor to form sideline production professional teams, launching a large-scale sideline production campaign. According to preliminary statistics from 28 counties and cities including Changtu, Zhuanghe, Yingkou, Fengcheng, Xifeng, Gaiping, Fuxin, and Zhangwu, more than 470,000 people have been put into the sideline production front, producing more than 210 kinds of sideline products, with a total sideline output value of more than 31 million yuan.

In carrying out sideline production, this province has not only formulated plans and strengthened leadership at the county (city) and commune levels, but also closely coordinated agricultural and financial and trade departments to implement the correct combination of production and sales, which has effectively promoted the development of sideline production. For example, Lingyuan County implemented the "three guarantees and four combinations" method in organizing sideline production. The three guarantees are:
    (1) When there is a shortage of raw materials for sideline production, the supply and marketing department guarantees supply and is responsible for adjusting between availability and unavailability; (2) the agricultural department guarantees technical guidance and allocates technical personnel; (3) the supply and marketing department guarantees the purchase and sale of sideline products. The four combinations are: (1) the combination of people's communes and supply and marketing departments, that is, the combination of production and sales; (2) the combination of banks and supply and marketing departments, that is, supporting the supply and marketing departments with funds for large-scale purchases and sales; (3) the combination of purchasing work and central work; (4) the combination of purchasing personnel going to the countryside and participating in labor. This not only promptly adjusted and supplied the raw materials needed for sideline production, ensuring the continuous progress of sideline production, but also allowed a large number of sideline products to be sold in a timely manner.

In organizing sideline production, various places have also adopted a two-pronged approach in terms of business scope. The people's communes in Fuxin County stipulate that sidelines that are large-scale and convenient for the commune to manage in a unified manner, such as mining, weaving, cutting strips, and collecting mountain grass, are organized by the commune for collective production; sidelines that are small and scattered and not convenient for the commune to manage in a unified manner are allowed for commune members to engage in individually during holidays and production gaps.

The widespread development of sideline production movements in various places has not only rapidly increased the income of the communes and promptly solved the funds needed for production and life in the communes, but also powerfully supported the current industrial and agricultural production and construction. For example, the people's communes in the five counties of Beizhen, Heishan, and Changtu have produced minerals such as copper, iron, limestone, and barite, as well as construction stone needed by industry in their vigorous sideline production. Sideline production has provided even more significant support to agricultural construction. According to incomplete statistics from the six counties of Tieling, Jin County, and Lingyuan, they have produced and supplied more than 89,000 soil baskets and more than 100,000 carrying poles and hoe handles urgently needed for current water conservancy construction.

### 加强领导　产销结合  辽宁副业生产规模大

    加强领导　产销结合
    辽宁副业生产规模大
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省各地人民公社，在兴修农田水利和开展积肥等工作的同时，抽调部分劳力，组成副业生产专业队，掀起了大规模的副业生产运动。仅据昌图、庄河、营口、凤城、西丰、盖平、阜新、彰武等二十八个县、市的初步统计，目前投入副业生产战线的人数已有四十七万多人，生产的副业产品有二百一十多种，副业产值已达到三千一百多万元。
    这个省在开展副业生产中，除县（市）、社都制订了规划和加强领导外，农业和财贸部门还密切配合，实行产与销的正确结合，有力地促进了副业生产的开展。如凌源县在组织副业生产工作中，实行了“三包四结合”的办法。三包是：
  （一）副业生产原料不足时，供销部门包供应，负责有无之间的调剂；（二）农业部门包技术指导，调配技术人员；（三）供销部门包购包销副业产品。四结合是：（一）人民公社与供销部门结合，即产销结合；（二）银行与供销部门结合，即支援供销部门大购大销的资金；
  （三）收购工作与中心工作结合；
  （四）收购人员下乡工作与参加劳动结合。这样不仅及时地调剂与供应了副业生产所需要的原料，保证了副业生产的持续进行，而且大量的副业产品也可以及时地销售出去。
    各地组织副业生产中，在经营范围方面，也采取了两条腿走路的办法。阜新县各人民公社规定：属于大宗的、公社便于统一经营的副业，如采矿、编织、割条子、打山草等，由公社组织集体生产；属于小型分散的、公社不便于统一经营的副业，允许社员利用假日和生产空隙个人搞。
    各地副业生产运动的普遍开展，不仅迅速地增加了公社的收入，及时地解决了公社生产和生活上所需要的资金，而且有力地支援了当前的工农业生产和建设。如北镇、黑山、昌图等五个县人民公社在大搞副业生产中，就生产出工业上所需要的铜矿、铁矿、石灰石、重晶石等矿石和建筑用石等。副业生产对农业建设的支援更为显著。仅据铁岭、锦县、凌源等六县的不完全统计，就生产供应了当前水利建设急需的土篮子八万九千多付，扁担和锹镐把十万多个。
