Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 9th. West Germany will soon produce atomic weapons that it is forbidden from producing by the Paris Agreements.

According to a report by the German News Agency, the Bonn Ministry of Defense announced on the 8th that the matter of producing atomic rockets is being "seriously considered." Negotiations are currently underway in Bonn, Paris, and Rome regarding the joint production of American "Hawk" atomic rockets by West Germany, France, and Italy.

According to another dispatch from Bonn, West Germany is continuing to provide military forces to the North Atlantic military group. Since the beginning of the new year, it has already provided two fighter-bomber squadrons equipped with American aircraft and a destroyer.

In addition, a statement was issued by the "University Students Anti-Atomic Armament Conference" convened by the working committee against West German atomic armament from universities and colleges in West Germany and West Berlin, pointing out that West Germany's atomic armament is a "decisive obstacle to easing tensions in Central Europe."

It said that atomic armament is burying democracy, while the anti-atomic armament movement is a movement to defend democracy.

    新华社柏林9日电　西德不久就要生产巴黎协定禁止它生产的原子武器了。
  据德意志通讯社报道，波恩国防部8日宣布，关于生产原子火箭的事，正在“认真考虑中”。目前已经在波恩、巴黎和罗马就西德、法国和意大利三国配合起来生产美国“鹰”式原子火箭举行谈判。
    另据来自波恩的消息，西德正在继续为北大西洋军事集团提供军事部队。新年开始后，它已经提供了由美国飞机装备的两个战斗轰炸机中队和一艘驱逐舰。
    又讯　由西德和西柏林各大学和高等学校的反对西德原子武装工作委员会召集的“大学生反原子武装大会”发表声明，指出西德进行原子武装是“缓和中欧紧张局势的决定性障碍”。
    他说，原子武装是埋葬民主的，而反原子武装运动却是维护民主的运动。
