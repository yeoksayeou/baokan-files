Aesthetic Problems
    Qin Li

    During a recent viewing of a acrobatic performance, I was struck by a question, which I raise here for discussion. This was a very high-level acrobatic troupe, with many acts that were delightful and admirable. I had seen acrobatic performances in the past, but they did not seem to reach such a high level of skill.

    However, in many of the successful acts, a female performer's "contortionism" seemed somewhat lacking—or, to be more precise, "lacking in beauty." I believe it could be improved and elevated. She performed various astonishing movements of the human body's limbs and waist, bending freely, "as if without bones." The performances of this type that I had seen in the past were not as "extreme" as this one—I can't find the right words to describe it, so I can only use these two seemingly mismatched words. Because, if you see someone who can turn their feet backwards and place them under their chin, if you see someone who can make their buttocks and head touch... what words would you use to express your surprise? Such contortionism may be called a unique skill. It's good, but some of the movements and poses don't give people a sense of beauty. On the contrary, they make people feel somewhat grotesque—if not ugly. These extreme movements and deformed postures are a destruction of the beautiful image of the human body, rather than an enhancement or elevation.

    Of course, contortionism is acrobatics, not dance, and we cannot demand the same things from acrobatics as we do from dance. However, since contortionism performs human body movements, although it is not dance, it is at least close to gymnastics, and it should give people a beautiful feeling. The last movement of this contortionism act is the performer holding a flower in her mouth, using the flower to support her entire body. Why use a flower, and not some other ugly object, to perform? This shows that contortionism performances also need to consider the question of aesthetics. I think this program is worth studying.

    美感问题
    秦犁
    我在一次观看杂技表演的时候，感到一个问题，提出来供探讨。这是一个水平很高的杂技团，许多节目令人欣赏赞佩。过去我也看到过杂技演出，似乎没有达到过这样高的技巧水平。
    但是在许多成功的节目中，有一位女演员表演的“柔术”，却使人觉得美中不足——说得正确些，是“美的不足”，我以为可以加以改进和提高。她表演的是人体四肢和腰部的各种惊人的动作，屈曲自如，“好像没有骨头一样”。我过去所看到的这一类表演都没有这次“厉害”——我选择不出适当的字眼来形容，只能用这两个似乎对不上头的字。因为，如果你看到一个人能够把两只脚反转来放在下巴之下，如果你看到一个人能够使自己的臀部和脑袋接触……你将用什么词儿来表示你的惊讶呢？这样的柔术也许可以称得上绝技。好是好，可就是其中有一些动作、姿态的形象不能给人美的感觉，反而使人觉得有些怪诞——如果不用丑这个字眼的话。这些极度的动作，畸形的姿态是一种对人体的美的形象的破坏，而不是加强或者提高。
  当然，柔术是杂技，不是舞蹈，我们不能像对舞蹈那样来要求杂技。不过，由于柔术所表演的是人体的运动，虽非舞蹈，至少同体操表演接近，它应该给人以优美的感觉。这个柔术节目的最后一个动作是演员口衔一枝花，由这枝花把她整个身体支持起来。为什么要用花，而不用其他丑的形象的物体来表演呢？可见柔术表演也是要顾到美感问题的。我以为这个节目是值得研究的。
