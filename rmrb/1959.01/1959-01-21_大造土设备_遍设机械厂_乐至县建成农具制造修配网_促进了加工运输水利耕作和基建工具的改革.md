This newspaper, Chengdu, 20th - According to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, launched a "Three-Five" movement in the mechanical industry ("Three-Five" means equipping each district and commune's factory with five machine tools, each team having five tools, and using five kinds of power to drive operations), building earth machine tools and earth tools on a large scale. This quickly achieved significant results in the reform of tools in five aspects: agricultural product processing, transportation, water conservancy, farming, and infrastructure.

Now, thirty-six of the county's fifty-one communes have farm implement manufacturing plants, each plant averaging three machine tools such as lathes, drilling machines, and planers; four hundred and forty production teams have established farm implement repair stations, each station averaging five large tools (including pliers, steel files, hacksaws, hand drills, and screw plates), forming a farm implement manufacturing and repair network throughout the county. Not only can general improved tools and new-style farm implements be manufactured, but even automobile valves, pistons, pulleys, motor housings, as well as bench vises, milling machines, etc., can be manufactured independently.

More than two months ago, Lezhi County's mechanical industry was still a blank slate. The Lezhi County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the masses of the county to carry out a debate on whether indigenous methods could manufacture machines, breaking the mysterious view of manufacturing machinery, thoroughly liberating thinking, and launching a movement to manufacture machinery using indigenous methods through on-site meetings and mass suggestion and advice campaigns. If there was no steel to make machine tool frames, wood and stone were used instead, and some even converted cotton gin frames into lathe frames; without drilling machines for processing, hand drills and the like were used instead, and hand shovels were used instead of planers.

After a month or two of effort, Lezhi County not only manufactured one hundred and twenty-one indigenous lathes, drilling machines, planers, and milling machines, more than five thousand pliers, steel files, hacksaws, hand drills, and screw plates, but also manufactured more than one hundred and fifty kinds of new-style improved farm implements, more than five hundred and twenty thousand pieces. The county has taken a big step forward in realizing the motorization of rural transportation, the improvement of infrastructure tools, the improvement of farming plows and harrows, the ball-bearingization of rotating tools, and the semi-mechanization of processing tools. Due to the reform of tools, labor efficiency has been improved, saving a lot of labor. According to statistics, the county can save more than five thousand and six hundred labor days annually in only five aspects: agricultural product processing, transportation, water conservancy, farming, and basic construction, equivalent to an increase of eighteen thousand laborers.

In order to catch up with the needs of this year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture and make a big effort in technological revolution, the county has made a larger plan for the development of the mechanical industry, requiring the trial production of thirty types of new-style farm implements in deep plowing, rice transplanting, harvesting, processing, and transportation, totaling three hundred and fifty thousand pieces. In order to continue to implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, the county plans to build a mechanical plant equipped with forty machine tools; each of the county's fifty-one communes will have three to five machine tools in its farm implement factory, so that each team will have five major tools. On the basis of existing indigenous mechanical equipment, coal gas engines, steam water pumps, ball mills, generators, and gantry planers, bullhead planers, and other machine parts will be produced, and five kinds of power sources such as electricity, water power, animal power, hand cranking, and foot pedaling will be fully utilized according to local conditions. At the same time, in order to strengthen the management of existing enterprises, it is required to establish a production responsibility system in conjunction with the rectification of the commune, gradually achieving factory-like management and improving technical level.

    大造土设备　遍设机械厂
    乐至县建成农具制造修配网
    促进了加工运输水利耕作和基建工具的改革
    本报成都20日电　四川省乐至县根据农业生产大跃进的新形势，开展机械工业的“三五”运动（“三五”即装备每个区、公社的工厂五部机床，每个队有五件工具和使用五种动力带动操作），大造土机床、土工具，使农产品加工、运输、水利、耕作、基建等五个方面的工具改革，很快获得了显著成就。
    现在，这个县五十一个公社中已有三十六个公社有了农具制造厂，平均每厂都有车床、钻床、刨床、铣床等三部；四百四十个生产队建立了农具修配站，平均每站有五样大件工具（包括老虎钳、钢锉、钢锯、手摇钻、丝板），在全县范围内形成一个农具制造修配网。不仅一般改良工具、新式农具能够制造，甚至像汽车凡尔、活塞、皮带轮、马达壳，以及钳床、铣床等，也能自己制造。
    两个多月以前，乐至县的机械工业还是一张白纸。中共乐至县委曾领导全县群众开展了土法能不能造机器的辩论，打破制造机械的神秘观点，彻底解放思想，通过现场会议、群众献策献计运动，展开土法造机械运动。没有钢铁作机床架，便用木、石来代替，有的甚至把轧花机架改装成车床架；没有加工用的钻床，就用手钻等代替，用手铲代替刨床。
    经过了一、两个月的努力，乐至县不仅制造出一百二十一台土车床、钻床、刨床、铣床，五千多件老虎钳、钢锉、钢锯、手摇钻、丝板，而且还制造了各种新式改良农具一百五十多种、五十二万多件。全县在实现农村运输车子化、基建工具改良化、耕作犁耙改良化、运转工具滚珠轴承化、加工工具半机械化等方面，大大地前进了一步。由于工具改革，劳动效率提高，节约了大量劳动力。据统计，仅农产品加工、运输、水利、耕作、基本建设等五个方面，全县全年即可节约五千六百多个劳动日，相当于增加劳动力一万八千个。
    为赶上今年农业大跃进的需要，大闹技术革命，全县已作出更大发展机械工业的规划，要求试验生产三十五万件深耕、插秧、收割、加工、运输等方面的新式农具三十种。为继续贯彻土洋并举的方针，全县计划建成一个装备机床四十台机械厂；全县五十一个公社，每个公社的农具厂都有机床三至五台，作到队队有五大件工具，并在现有土机械设备的基础上，生产煤气机，蒸气水泵，球磨机，发电机和龙门刨，牛头刨等机件，因地制宜地充分运用电力、水力、畜力、手摇、脚踏等五种动力。同时，为加强现有企业的管理工作，要求结合整社建立生产责任制，逐步作到管理工厂化，提高技术水平。
