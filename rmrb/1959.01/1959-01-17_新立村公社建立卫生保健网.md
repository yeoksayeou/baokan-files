    Everyone Takes Action to Improve Collective Hygiene; Good Health Ensures Greater Leap Forward
    Xinli Village Commune Establishes Healthcare Network
    Implements a Three-Way Combination of Hygiene and Production, Medical Treatment and Prevention, Full-Time Personnel and the Masses
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 15th. The Xinli Village People's Commune in the suburbs of Tianjin has established a comprehensive medical and health care network, and has begun to integrate health care with production, medical treatment with prevention, and full-time health personnel with the masses. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee recently held an on-site meeting to promote this experience.
    The Xinli Village People's Commune is a large commune with ninety-one natural villages and more than 115,000 commune members. It originally had twenty-six rural medical and health care institutions and more than 120 medical personnel. The new health care network is built on this foundation, including the commune's health center, health stations and maternity homes in each production team, and specialized health groups established in nurseries, kindergartens, canteens, schools, homes for the elderly, veterinary stations, factories, and other units. In addition to professional medical personnel, the health network also has a mass health worker team.
    The main feature of the new health network is that medical and health care organizations at all levels are placed within production organizations at the same level, and health organizations and production organizations are integrated. In terms of organizational leadership, the commune has established a Culture, Education, Health, and Welfare Department, which directly leads the health center. The health center is a medical and preventive institution at the commune level and also a health administrative institution. Under the commune, each brigade has established a Culture, Education, Health, and Welfare Section, and each team has established a health team to lead health stations, maternity homes, and specialized health groups, and also has cadres in charge of medical prevention, maternal and child health, food hygiene, and environmental hygiene. This ensures that the health network can more effectively serve production and the health of the vast number of commune members. Recently, health organizations at all levels in the commune have taken a series of specific measures to ensure the improvement of sanitation and working conditions for commune members. For example, the Xinli Village Brigade Health Station, together with the production team, has established a women's labor protection system: when assigning labor tasks each day, women during their menstrual period are assigned to dry land labor; pregnant women are assigned to light labor; and breastfeeding women are assigned to nearby labor. This measure has been warmly welcomed by female commune members and has also ensured the attendance rate of women's labor. Now, each team (residential area) has a health team, health station, maternity home, and a set of specialized health groups, and commune members can generally seek medical treatment nearby when they are sick. For example, in the Xinli Village team, which has more than 2,000 people, commune members used to have to travel seven or eight miles to see a doctor when they were sick, but now they can not only see a doctor at the health station nearby, but the doctors at the health station also regularly patrol the fields and provide medical treatment on the spot. Doctors at the commune health center can also make immediate house calls when commune members have acute or serious illnesses.
    The establishment of the new health care network has changed the long-standing situation in the area where medical treatment and prevention work were not coordinated. Now, health care institutions are not only medical institutions but also prevention institutions; medical personnel are engaged in both medical and preventive work. Many doctors at health stations spend half the day in the clinic and half the day going to the fields for mobile medical treatment and visits, and they also regularly conduct health education work every week. In particular, in addition to conducting regular health knowledge publicity, the vast number of health workers also conduct intensive publicity during disease epidemics and are responsible for grasping the health status and disease occurrence of the masses within their scope. Recently, as soon as measles was discovered in this commune, the entire commune immediately took preventive isolation measures. Doctors at each health station and the vast number of health workers universally explained the prevention and nursing common sense of measles to the commune members, and individual sick children were assigned to doctors for fixed-point contracted treatment. As a result, the spread of the measles epidemic was effectively controlled.
    Because professional medical staff are combined with a large number of non-detached health workers, health work has become a commune-wide work. The non-detached health workers are selected from a group of young commune members in the production team, nursery and kindergarten caregivers, canteen cooks, and production team cleaning and fertilizer accumulation team members. Under the condition of not affecting production, they are regularly lectured and trained by doctors at the health station in groups according to their place of residence. Therefore, they know how to identify epidemics, use health kits, and can treat minor illnesses and injuries; caregivers know child-rearing hygiene knowledge; and cooks can do a good job in food operation hygiene and personal hygiene. Every day when commune members go to the fields, health workers also carry medicine kits to the fields together. When commune members have minor illnesses and injuries, the health workers treat them, which saves time and does not delay production. Health workers are also responsible for organizing the elimination of the four pests, checking personal hygiene and environmental hygiene, making epidemic reports, light illness care, serious illness escort, and health education and labor protection. This health worker team has become an important force in the commune's health care network.
    In the process of establishing the Xinli Village Commune's health network, it closely relied on the leadership of the Party organizations at all levels of the commune. The secretaries of the Party organizations at all levels personally took action to strengthen political and ideological work. In the early stage of establishment, a small number of medical personnel were enthusiastic about establishing large, foreign, new, and complete health care organizations; at this time, the Party organization promptly carried out education on running medical undertakings diligently and thriftily, and reversed this situation. Many brigade and team Party branch secretaries specifically guided the planning work of health stations, maternity homes, and so on. Some teams also have the deputy secretary or branch committee member of the Party branch serve as the political and ideological leadership of the health team, which not only guarantees the implementation of the Party's health work guidelines and policies, but also facilitates ideological education for medical personnel.

### 新立村公社建立卫生保健网

    大家动手搞好集体卫生  身强力壮保证更大跃进
    新立村公社建立卫生保健网
    实行卫生和生产、医疗和预防、专职人员和群众三结合
    新华社天津15日电　天津市郊区新立村人民公社建立起一套医疗卫生保健网，开始作到卫生保健工作和生产相结合，医疗和预防相结合，专职卫生人员和群众卫生人员相结合。中共天津市委和天津市人民委员会最近曾召开现场会议，推广这一经验。
    新立村人民公社是一个有九十一个自然村、十一万五千多社员的大公社，原有二十六处乡村医疗保健机构和一百二十多名医务人员。新的卫生保健网就是在这个基础上建立起来的，它包括有公社的卫生院，各个生产队的保健站和产院，在托儿所、幼儿园、食堂、学校、幸福院、兽医站、工厂等单位建立的专业卫生组。卫生网内除了专业的医务人员以外，还拥有一支群众性的卫生员队伍。
    新的卫生网的主要特点，是各级医疗卫生保健组织都置于同级生产组织之内，卫生组织和生产组织结成统一体。在组织领导上，公社成立文教卫生福利部，直接领导卫生院。卫生院是公社一级医疗预防机构，又是卫生行政机构。公社下面各大队成立文教卫生福利股，各中队成立卫生队，领导保健站、产院和各专业卫生组，还设有专管医疗预防、妇幼卫生、饮食卫生、环境卫生等干事。这样，保证了卫生网能够更有效地为生产，为广大社员的健康服务。最近公社各级卫生组织采取一套具体措施，来保证改善社员的卫生和劳动条件。例如新立村大队保健站同生产队一起，建立了妇女劳动保护制度：每天分配劳动时，对月经期的妇女，调做旱地劳动；对怀孕妇女，调做轻劳动；对哺乳的妇女，调做近处劳动。这项措施受到女社员的热烈欢迎，也保证了妇女劳动出勤率。现在，各中队（居民点）都有卫生队、保健站、产院和一套专业卫生组，社员有了病一般都能就近就医。例如有两千多人口的新立村中队，过去社员有病要到七、八里路以外去看，现在不仅可以就近到保健站看病，保健站的医生还经常到田间巡回，就地医疗。公社卫生院的医生，在社员发生急病或重病时，也可以立即出诊。
    新的卫生保健网的建立，改变了当地长期没有解决的医疗工作和预防工作不协调的情况。现在，卫生保健机构，不但是医疗机构，也是预防机构；医务人员既作医疗工作，也作预防工作。很多保健站的医生都是半天门诊、半天下地巡回医疗和访视，每周还定期进行卫生宣传工作，特别是广大卫生员除了作经常性的卫生知识宣传以外，在疾病流行时还进行突击宣传，并且负责掌握所属范围内群众的健康情况和疾病发生等情况。最近这个公社刚一发现麻疹，全社立即采取了预防隔离措施，各保健站的医生和广大卫生员普遍向社员讲解麻疹的预防和护理常识，个别病儿由医生定点包干负责治疗。结果，有效地控制了麻疹病情的蔓延。
    由于专业医护人员同广大不脱产的卫生员队伍相结合，卫生工作就成为全社性的工作。不脱产的卫生员，是由生产队里挑选出来的一批青年社员，幼儿园、托儿所的保育员，食堂的炊事员和生产队的清洁积肥队员等人担任的。他们在不影响生产的条件下，由保健站医生按居住情况定期分片讲课训练。因此，他们懂得鉴别疫情，使用保健箱，能治疗小病小伤；保育员懂得育儿卫生知识；炊事员能够作好食品操作卫生和个人卫生。每天社员下地，卫生员也背起药箱一块下地，社员们有了小病小伤就由卫生员给治疗，又省时间又不耽误生产。卫生员还负责组织除四害工作，检查个人卫生和环境卫生，作疫情报告、轻病护理、重病护送以及卫生宣传和劳动保护工作等。这支卫生员队伍已经成为公社卫生保健网中的一支重要力量。
    新立村公社的卫生网建立过程中，密切依靠了公社各级党组织的领导。各级党组织的书记都亲自动手加强政治思想工作。建立初期，有少数医务人员热心于建立大、洋、新、全的保健组织；这时，党组织就及时对他们进行勤俭办医疗事业的教育，扭转了这种情况。许多大队、中队的党支部书记都具体指导保健站、产院等的筹划工作。有些中队还由党支部副书记或支部委员担任卫生队的政治思想领导工作，既保证了党的卫生工作方针政策的贯彻，又便于对医务人员进行思想教育。
