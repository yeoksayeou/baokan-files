How to Make "Fire-Burnt Manure"

    In the production upsurges of the winter before last and the spring of last year, the Dawa People's Commune of Dawa Township, Changtu County, created a method of accumulating fertilizer called "fire-burnt manure." Crops fertilized with "fire-burnt manure" in this commune generally increased production by 10%-15%.

    "Fire-burnt manure" has four major benefits: (1) good quality, containing: nitrogen 1%-2%, phosphorus 0.1%-0.5%, potassium 1%-1.5%; (2) simple method, requiring only ten to fifteen workdays to burn one pit; (3) all kinds of crop stalks, weeds, etc., can be used to make manure; (4) this method can be used to make manure all year round, with each pit taking about fifteen days to burn.

    There are two methods of making "fire-burnt manure": one is the underground burning method; the other is the above-ground burning method.

    Underground pit burning involves digging a round pit in the ground, the size of which depends on the amount of raw material. Generally, it should be six to seven feet in diameter and five to six feet deep. A smoke channel is dug at the bottom of the pit to allow smoke to pass through and transmit heat. On one side of the pit, dig a fire channel that is a little over one foot away, three feet wide, six feet deep, and five feet long. To burn one pit of manure, you need 1,500 catties of crop stalks, corn husks, or weeds, *Lespedeza* and the like, 1,000 catties of soil, 400 catties of horse manure, and 2,500 catties of diluted human manure liquid (500 catties of human manure and 2,000 catties of water). First, put horse manure at the bottom, then layer soil, *Lespedeza*, and human manure liquid, layering in this order until the pit is full. Immediately start burning to smoke. Generally, you need to burn the fire four to five times within fifteen days to smoke it well and ferment it thoroughly.

    Above-ground burning involves taking materials on the spot, right next to the ground or in the field, to burn manure. How to dig the manure burning trenches: dig trenches on the ground in a grid pattern, eight feet to one *zhang* long, and eight inches deep and wide. After the trenches are dug, tie sorghum stalks or corn stalks into bundles about two to three inches thick and insert them at the intersections of the trenches to allow smoke to pass through and smoke the manure. To burn one pile of manure, you need 500 catties of horse manure, 2,000 catties of human manure, and 8,000 to 10,000 catties of soil. According to the proportion of raw materials, layer them. First soil, then horse manure, then human manure, layering in this order until it is about three feet high. After the materials are piled up, fill the mouths of each trench with kindling, light it, and let it burn for five to six minutes. Then, block the trench mouths with adobe or soil clods. This allows the smoke to rise along the sorghum stalk bundles that are used as chimneys, smoking the soil. It will be ready in five to seven days. (According to a report from *Liaoning Daily*)

    怎样搞“火烧粪”
    昌图县大洼乡大洼人民公社，于前年冬天和去年春天的生产高潮中，创造了一种“火烧粪”的积肥方法。这个社施“火烧粪”的庄稼，一般增产10％—15％。
    火烧粪有四大好处：（1）质量好，含有：氮1％—2％，磷0.1％—0.5％，钾1％—1.5％；（2）方法简单，烧一窖用十——十五个工即可；（3）各种作物秸棵、杂草等均可造粪；（4）全年都可用此法造粪，每窖烧十五天左右即可。
    “火烧粪”有两种方法：一种是地下烧粪法；另一种是地上烧粪法。
    地下坑烧粪，就是在地下挖一圆坑，坑的大小，看原料多少而定，一般的应直径六——七尺，深五——六尺。坑底挖成通烟道，用作通烟传热。坑的一边，距一尺多远地方挖一个宽三尺深六尺，长五尺的烧火下道。烧一坑粪需用一千五百斤作物秸子、苞米皮或杂草、格荛等，一千斤土，四百斤马粪，二千五百斤人粪尿稀制液（人粪尿五百斤，水二千斤）。底层先放马粪，然后一层土一层格荛、一层人粪尿，分层以此堆积，坑满以后立行烧火熏烟，一般十五天内烧火四——五次方可熏好沤透。
    地上烧粪法，即是在地边或田地里，就地取材，就地烧粪。烧粪沟的挖法：在地面上挖纵横成方格形的沟，沟长八尺——一丈，深、宽各八寸。沟挖好后，用秫秸或苞米秆扎成大小二——三寸粗的把子，插在沟的交接处，以备通烟熏粪。烧一堆粪，需马粪五百斤，人粪尿二千斤，土八千到一万斤。按着原料比例，分层堆积，先土、后马粪、再后人粪尿，依此堆积到三尺高左右为止。材料堆完后，在各个沟头口，填上引柴点火燃烧，等柴火燃烧五——六分钟后，用土坯或土块堵住沟口，这就使烟顺着秫秸把子作的烟囱，冒出烟熏土；五——七天即可烧好。（据辽宁日报消息）
