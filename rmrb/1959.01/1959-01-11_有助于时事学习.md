    Helps with the Study of Current Events
    The three articles published in the People's Daily on December 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, "The American Economic Crisis Has a Tendency to Further Deteriorate," "The Imperialist Camp Is Riddled with Contradictions," and "Claws Stretched Everywhere, Noose Tied All Over," analyze the dog-eat-dog struggles within the imperialist camp and the current military and economic situation in the United States, allowing us to understand more concretely that imperialism is rotting away day by day.
    These three articles are very helpful to us and also provide us with rich reference material for studying Chairman Mao's documents on paper tigers.

    有助于时事学习
    人民日报12月21日、22日和23日刊载的“美国经济危机有进一步恶化的趋势”、“帝国主义阵营矛盾重重”、“魔爪到处伸，绞索套满身”三篇文章，分析了帝国主义阵营狗咬狗的斗争和美国军事、经济现状，使我们更具体地了解到帝国主义正在一天一天地烂下去。
    这三篇文章对我们很有帮助，也给我们学习毛主席论纸老虎文献提供了丰富的参考材料。
