Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 25th: TASS reported that First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, answered several questions raised by reporters at a press conference held in the Kremlin on the 24th.

    Answering a question from a "Pravda" reporter, Mikoyan said: In almost all conversations, I have had to explain in detail our arguments on the Berlin issue. In the face of our strong arguments, the Americans cannot put forward any convincing counterarguments. The main argument used to confuse many Americans is that it seems we have set a deadline for negotiations, which is equivalent to issuing an ultimatum to everyone. Some even accuse us of threatening people with force.

    Mikoyan said, I have tried my best to prove that this concept of distorting our position is completely incorrect. We have not issued any ultimatums to anyone, nor have we threatened anyone; these are fabrications. The Americans fabricated these things themselves and frightened themselves. We do not want to obtain any privileges for ourselves on the Berlin issue, nor do we want to harm anyone's interests, but only want to end the vestiges of war—the occupation of West Berlin. We hope that West Berlin will have the status of an independent, demilitarized, free city, so that people of all countries can freely come to West Berlin, and all relevant countries will guarantee this status of West Berlin with the participation of the United Nations.

    Mikoyan pointed out that the American ruling group acts according to its own intentions and is unwilling to hold negotiations. American newspapers are shouting that in another six months, the Russians will implement their plan. However, the fact that a deadline is set for negotiations is not terrible in itself. The main point of our proposal is not the deadline for negotiations, but the negotiations themselves and the necessity of holding negotiations. If we can convince ourselves that the Western countries are sincere in negotiating to eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin, I don't think it would be difficult to extend the deadline for negotiations by two or three weeks, or even two or three months.

    When a reporter from the Romanian News Agency asked about the prospects for the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United States, Mikoyan replied: We advocate the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United States, but significant development of this trade is only possible if the restrictions imposed by the US government are lifted. American business circles advocate the removal of these restrictions, but in my opinion, the US State Department is not yet prepared to do so. We will wait for the situation to improve.

    Next, Mikoyan answered a question from an Agence France-Presse reporter regarding the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket. He said that the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket will be of great significance for improving the international situation. This is a new proof of our country's power. The Soviet Union is unwilling to use its power to serve war, but is willing to use it to consolidate peace.

    Mikoyan said to the reporters present: During a conversation at a banquet held by Dulles, a minister asked me if I recognized the principle of material interests. Mr. Dulles answered this question for me, and answered it very expertly and accurately, almost as if I were going to answer it myself. He said at the time that the Soviet Union is now in the first stage, namely socialism, and is moving towards the second stage, namely communism. I praised his knowledge of Marxism-Leninism at the time (laughter). He then suddenly sent me a telegram, which I received on the plane. The telegram said that there is state capitalism in the Soviet Union, while there is private capitalism in the United States. When I stopped at the Argentia Naval Air Station in the United States, I sent a telegram back to Mr. Dulles, politely refuting it, unwilling to use harsh words. I even thought that Mr. Dulles might be joking. However, Comrade Gromyko told me very correctly that it is still far from April 1st (April Fool's Day), and it is incomprehensible to make an April Fool's joke in January.

    Mikoyan also talked about the relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany. He said that we have good relations with the German Democratic Republic, and we hope to have good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany as well. My visit to Bonn last year was aimed at consolidating and improving this relationship. The residents and business circles there all hope for peace and hope to be friendly with us and the people of other countries. But, of course, there are also revanchists over there. Mr. Adenauer had promising talks with me on the issue of improving relations between the two countries. But later, he adopted a belligerent tone towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, especially the German Democratic Republic. Now, Adenauer is the first to oppose our proposal for a German peace treaty, especially opposing the solution to the West Berlin issue. All of these have deteriorated relations between the two countries. But we have not lost hope, and we will take measures to improve our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. I think that at a certain time they will repent.

    "Neues Deutschland" reporter Holstein asked: Do you think that the United States now also agrees with the proposal for the establishment of a confederation between the two Germanies? Mikoyan said: I dare not say for sure, but I cannot fail to mention a statement made by Mr. Dulles at a press conference once. This statement was different from what we had heard before. He said that free elections are not the only way to restore German unity. This is a very interesting statement.

    Mikoyan told the reporters that the United States has not yet replied to the Soviet Union's proposal for a German peace treaty. They cannot simply deny the Soviet Union's proposal, but judging from all aspects, it is difficult to say what kind of results will be produced by the questions they raised in this regard.

    Mikoyan said at the end of the press conference: Before I finish my speech, I would like to say a few words about Denmark. I passed through Denmark on my way to and from the United States this time. I had two pleasant and fruitful meetings and discussions with Danish Prime Minister Hansen and Foreign Minister Krag. I would like to express my gratitude to the Danish people and government for giving us such a good reception during our stay in Denmark.

    米高扬在记者招待会上指出
    苏联宇宙火箭上天有助改善国际局势
    新华社26日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科25日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬24日在克里姆林宫举行的记者招待会上回答了记者向他提出的一些问题。
    米高扬在回答“真理报”记者的问题时说：几乎在所有的谈话中我都不得不详细地说明我们在柏林问题上的论据。在我们有力的论据面前，美国人不可能提出任何令人信服的反论据。用来迷惑许多美国人的主要论点是，似乎我们规定了进行谈判的期限，就等于向所有的人提出了最后通牒。有人甚至责备我们，好像我们是采用武力来威胁人。
    米高扬说，我尽力证明歪曲我们立场的这种概念是完全不正确的。我们没有向谁提出过任何最后通牒，也没有威胁过谁，这些都是捏造的；美国人自己捏造了这些东西，自己吓唬了自己。我们不想在柏林问题上为自己获得任何特权，也不想损害任何人的利益，而只是想结束战争残余——对西柏林的占领。我们希望西柏林得到独立的非军事化的自由城市地位，以便各国人民都能自由地到西柏林来，一切有关国家在联合国参预下将保证西柏林的这一地位。
  米高扬指出，美国统治集团按照自己意图行事，不愿意举行谈判。美国报纸叫喊，再过六个月俄国人就要实行自己的计划。但是，规定举行谈判期限的事实本身并没有什么可怕。我们建议中的要点不在于举行谈判的期限，而在于谈判本身和举行谈判的必要性。如果能使我们相信西方国家有诚意进行谈判来消除西柏林占领制度，我认为，把举行谈判期限延长两三周，甚至两三个月并不是难事。
    当罗马尼亚通讯社记者问及苏联和美国的贸易发展前途的时候，米高扬回答说：我们主张发展苏联和美国之间的贸易，但是这种贸易的重大发展只有在取消美国政府所实行的限制的情况下才有可能实现。美国实业界主张取消这些限制，但以我看来，美国国务院还没有准备这样作。我们将等待时机的好转。
    接着，米高扬回答了法新社记者提出的有关苏联发射宇宙火箭的问题。他说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射对于改善国际局势将有很大的意义。这是我国威力的新的证明。苏联不愿利用它的威力来为战争服务，而愿意用来为巩固和平服务。
    米高扬对与会各位记者说：在杜勒斯举行的一次宴会上进行交谈时，有一位部长问我，您是否承认物质利益原则，杜勒斯先生代替我回答了这个问题，并且回答得十分内行和准确，几乎像我本人要回答的那样。他当时说，苏联现在是处在第一阶段，即社会主义，并且正走向第二阶段，即共产主义。我当时夸奖了他的马克思列宁主义的知识（笑声）。他紧接着又突然向我拍来了一封电报，我在飞机上收到了它。电报说，苏联国内存在国家资本主义，而美国存在的是私人资本主义。当我停留在美国阿根夏基地时，我给杜勒斯先生拍了回电，客气地给了反驳，不愿用激烈的字眼，我甚至以为这可能是杜勒斯先生在开玩笑。但是，葛罗米柯同志向我说得很对，现在离开4月1日（愚人节）还远着呢，而4月份的玩笑在1月份开是令人费解的。
    米高扬还谈到苏联和西德的关系。他说，我们同德意志民主共和国有着良好的关系，我们希望同德意志联邦共和国也有良好的关系。去年我访问波恩的目的是巩固和改善这种关系。那里的居民和实业界人士都希望和平，希望同我们以及其他各国人民友好。但是，当然，那边也有复仇主义者。阿登纳先生曾同我就改善两国关系问题进行了令人抱有希望的谈话。但是后来，他对苏联和其他社会主义国家，特别是德意志民主共和国采取了好战的腔调。现在，阿登纳首先反对我们关于对德和约的建议，特别是反对解决西柏林问题。所有这些都使两国关系恶化了。但是我们没有失去希望，我们将采取措施来改善我们同德意志联邦共和国的关系。我认为，到一定时候他们会反悔的。
      “新德意志报”记者霍尔斯坦问：您是否认为，现在美国也赞同关于两个德国建立邦联的建议？米高扬说：我不敢断言，但是不能不提一提杜勒斯先生有一次在记者招待会上的声明。这次声明同我们以前听到的不同了。他说，自由选举并不是恢复德国统一的唯一道路。这是很有意思的声明。
  米高扬对记者们说，美国还没有答复苏联关于对德和约的建议。他们不能简单地否定苏联这个主张，但是，从各方面判断，他们在这方面提出的那些问题，很难说会产生什么样结果。
    米高扬在结束记者招待会时说：在我的讲话结束之前，我想说几句有关丹麦的话。我这次去美国，来回都路过丹麦。我同丹麦首相汉森先生和外交大臣克拉格进行过两次愉快和有益的会见和座谈。我想对丹麦人民和政府表示感谢，感谢他们在我们逗留丹麦的期间给我们以很好的接待。
