A Paradise for Maritime Activities
——Qingdao China People's Navigation Club

In the picturesque coastal city of Qingdao, maritime sports strongly attract the vast number of young people. The China People's Navigation Club, located in Qingdao, has become a "paradise for maritime activities" for these maritime sports enthusiasts. They often use their spare time after school and work to come here and learn theoretical knowledge and techniques related to the navy, navigation, and shipbuilding. During holidays, people flock to this "paradise for maritime activities." The club's training ship is filled with navigation enthusiasts for maritime practice and to experience life at sea; in the electromechanical laboratory, members of the engine and electrical groups, under the guidance of amateur instructors, conduct operational practice and experiments; the exhibition room displaying ship models is often packed with visitors; at the water sports station, various naval sports athletes can be seen practicing climbing, heaving lines, communications, and other activities intensively; the sampan athletes practice rowing and sailing almost every day; and the motorboat athletes skillfully drive their motorboats, speeding back and forth across the sea.

Many maritime sports enthusiasts have learned navigation and naval knowledge and skills in this "paradise." Many of them have become excellent naval athletes, and many have become reliable reserve forces for national defense and socialist construction. Since the club was established in 1953, it has trained more than 20,000 naval athletes, model boat enthusiasts, and electromechanical group members. Wu Qiwei, China's outstanding female motorboat athlete who won gold, silver, and bronze medals at the Second International Naval Sports Competition in 1957, was trained by this club.

    海上活动的乐园
    ——青岛中国人民航海俱乐部
    在风景如画的我国滨海城市青岛，航海运动有力地吸引着广大青少年。设在青岛的中国人民航海俱乐部成了这些航海运动爱好者的
  “海上活动的乐园”。他们经常利用课余、业余时间到这里来学习有关海军、航海和造船的理论知识和技术。每逢假日，人们就纷纷涌到这个“海上活动的乐园”来。俱乐部的实习船满载着航海爱好者们到海上实习和体验生活；机电实验室里，轮机、电工小组组员们在业余教练员的辅导下，进行操纵实习和试验；舰船等模型陈列室里常常是挤满了参观者；在水上运动站，可以看到航海多项运动员在紧张地练习着攀登、撇缆、通讯等活动；舢舨运动员几乎天天都在练习荡桨和驶帆；摩托艇运动员，熟练地驾着摩托艇在海面上飞也似地来往驰骋。
    多少个航海运动爱好者就在这个“乐园”里学到了航海和海军知识和本领。他们很多人成了优秀的航海运动员，很多人成为祖国海防和社会主义建设中的可靠的后备力量。自1953年俱乐部成立到现在已培养出航海运动员、航海模型和机电组员两万多人。在1957年举行的第二届国际航海运动竞赛中获得金、银、铜三种奖章的我国优秀女摩托运动员吴其伟就是这个俱乐部培养出来的。
