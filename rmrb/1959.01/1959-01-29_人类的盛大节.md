    Humanity's Grand Festival

  　Three. Those of us of a certain generation probably still remember that when the Russian October Revolution broke out and the Soviet regime was first established, a new term came from Japan to China: "radical faction," "radicalism." This was the then-current Chinese translation of "Bolshevik" and "Bolshevism."

    Imperialists, monopoly capitalists, big merchants, factory owners, landlords, and wealthy people buzzed with discussion: radicalism was a scourge, radicals killed and set fires, practiced communism of wives... How terrible and hateful the painters hired and kept by them painted the Bolsheviks! Not with three heads and six arms, but with wolf fangs and tiger claws... Their journalists and writers described Soviet Russia as a world of hunger, cold, and darkness... In a word: the end of the world had come, and the criminal was the Bolshevik, was Lenin and his "radical party"...

    In 1919-1920, the "opinion" of the West on Soviet Russia could be seen from the names of two books. One was written by the American political commentator Robert Wilton, called "Russia's Death Struggle"; the other was written by the British science fiction writer Herbert Wells, called "Russia in the Shadows." The former "predicted" that from an economic point of view, it was impossible for the Soviet Union to continue to exist, and from a political point of view, it was absurd; the latter said that if the West did not help Russia, then Russia "had no other future except to completely destroy the last remnants of modern civilization."

    It was to this publicly recognized bold science fiction writer that Lenin opened the "bold draft" of Russian electrification. It seems that this British guest was not bold enough. Although he was temporarily conquered by Lenin's firm and optimistic confidence, he later said that Lenin was a "utopian"...

    But another great Western writer with great talent and profound accomplishment, Romain Rolland, said something different. He believed that Lenin's fantasy was in action.

    This is much better than Wells' statement! Yes, the Communists dare to practice, are full of drive, and are full of ideals and ambitions. When Communists are determined to transform the world, they often combine fantasy and science. In our current words, revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism have always been well combined in Communists. Whether it is political, economic, cultural, artistic... any work shows this noble and valuable quality.

    After ending the civil war and driving out the intervention armies of fourteen countries, the Soviet Union actively engaged in restoring the thoroughly destroyed national economy. On the vast land occupying one-sixth of the earth, thousands upon thousands of old, middle-aged, and young men and women carried out extraordinarily difficult and resolute work with soaring enthusiasm. How many poems praising labor in that era still inspire people when recited today! Can you say that Paul Korchagin only knew how to work hard and without lofty ideals? Without fantasy? It was in that era that the "Communist Saturday" movement was born. It was at that time that Lenin planned the nationwide electrification and cooperative movement.

    It is almost unbelievable that when the Soviet Union restored the 1913 level of industrial production, set about fundamentally transforming the national economy, and began to implement the first five-year plan, it was about fifty to one hundred years behind the most developed capitalist countries; but ten years later (Lenin once smiled and said to Wells: "Please come again in ten years and see what Russia has done during this period?"), by 1930, the Soviet Union had already done what Britain needed a hundred years to do!

    I myself experienced the periods of the first and second five-year plans in the Soviet Union, and personally saw how the socialist construction of the Soviet Union developed by leaps and bounds; I also saw how the capable hands and heroic wisdom of the Soviet people were used simultaneously, and how calm scientific thinking and flying fantasy were closely combined.

    The Hitler fascist plague interrupted the third five-year plan and caused great disasters to the Soviet Union. But as soon as the war stopped, the Soviet people, under the call of the Party, restored and expanded their construction at a mythical speed. By 1958, industrial output ranked first in Europe and second in the world. The steel output and oil production in each month of 1958 were more than the whole year of 1913! The power generation every three days was equal to the total power generation in the Tsarist era! Doesn't this show the combination of the Soviet people's practical drive and magnificent fantasy again?

    But all this is already in the past; what is important and amazing is still behind, in today and tomorrow: – In the forty-first anniversary of the Great October Revolution and entering the forty-second year, how many miracles have appeared on Soviet soil! Just the fact that three artificial Earth satellites have been sent into the sky one after another has shocked the whole world. And while the third artificial moon was still revolving around the earth, as the opening ceremony for 1959 and a gift to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet people launched a giant cosmic rocket, which flew over the moon and became the first artificial solar satellite! Isn't this an unprecedented event? Isn't this a myth turned into reality? It is appropriate for all progressive humanity to rejoice and be encouraged by it. But a small group of enemies of peace were dumbfounded.

    Facts are ironclad proof: one side launches and hits every time; one side fails every time. One side's economy, culture, and science are thriving; one side's crisis, panic, unemployment, decadence, and backwardness. One side is like the rising sun, with infinite light; one side is like the setting sun, with boundless darkness.

    One side fabricates rumors and slanders, strengthens the Cold War and subversion activities, or scurries around and lights fires everywhere, its momentum fierce, but each time it has to run away with its tail between its legs, and has to study how to surrender, how to hold its position, block the east wind, and how to get rid of the noose; one side is as stable as Mount Tai, speaks righteously, extinguishes the flames of war, defends world peace, supports the vigorously developing national independence and people's liberation movement, and advocates peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition.

    Just as the socialist system has already been established in the world and the colonial system is increasingly collapsing, that is, when "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day," the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as the leader, organizer, and encourager of the Soviet people's struggle for the victory of communism, and as Lenin once pointed out, the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era, is holding the 21st Congress to discuss the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965. From what we have already read in "Comrade Khrushchev's Report Outline at the 21st Congress of the CPSU," it should be affirmed that this is a congress convened at a time when the creativity of the great Soviet Union is in an unprecedented period of prosperity, a congress where the great Soviet people are advancing with firm steps and full confidence along the road to communism, and a congress where the great Soviet people - not only the Soviet people - are entering a new and important period of development - the comprehensive development of communist construction.

    The seven-year plan to be discussed at the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a component part of the "long-term plan for the development of the national economy in the next fifteen years, and is the economic program for the construction of Soviet communism" (Report Outline). Thinking of these things, we cannot help but leap three hundred, waving and cheering: Communism - the highest and most beautiful ideal of mankind - is not far away!

    When Marx and Engels co-authored the "Communist Manifesto," communism was still a "specter" "wandering in Europe," naturally taking secluded paths. But since its appearance, its footsteps have grown larger day by day, and later it strode across the five continents and five oceans of the earth, and issued a loud call. In October 1917, its loud call, its sound of artillery, shook the world, sent Marxism-Leninism, and awakened China, the East, and all the oppressed people of the world. For more than forty years, this call has lingered in people's ears morning and evening, exciting people's heartstrings, enlightening people's wisdom, and enhancing people's confidence and courage. People have stood up, acted, and moved forward, forward, and forward in one direction. No force can stop their steps, and no force can make them retreat.

    Today, communism has raised its head high, standing tall on the land of one-fourth of the world, from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Adriatic coast in the west - the entire socialist camp!

    Despite the fact that the pioneers, predecessors, and descendants of anti-communism (such as Dulles and his ilk) have been wailing about "the threat of communism" for forty years..., the overwhelming majority of mankind - more than two billion! - all hate this cliché, because people have clearly read and understood what Comrade Khrushchev said in his report outline: "The achievements of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries not only do not threaten anyone, but are a guarantee of maintaining peace and the security of all peoples." "The policy of peace and peaceful coexistence pursued by socialist countries is by no means an accidental or temporary phenomenon, this policy is an organic product of socialist society." They also read: "In the next seven years... we will complete a new leap forward on the road of socialist economy developing towards communism, and greatly improve the economic potential of the Soviet Union for the further growth of the people's welfare."

  "The seven-year plan is based on profound qualitative changes in various sectors of the national economy developing along the road of progress... Due to the vigorous development of productive forces, the task of greatly raising the people's living standards and creating the prerequisites for establishing abundant material welfare in the country will be completed in the next seven years, abundant material welfare is '...necessary to ensure the full welfare and free and comprehensive development of all members of society' (Lenin)."

    May I ask, how can this be a "threat" to others?

    The overwhelming majority of people in the world have also clearly heard and read: "In order to transition to communism, not only a strong material and technical base is needed, but also a high level of awareness among all citizens of socialist society... In the process of communist construction... man himself has also changed, and man's communist worldview has been established..." May I ask, does this also "threaten" others?

    We know that in order to establish a communist worldview, we must wage a resolute struggle against everything that is anti-communist. We fully support what Comrade Khrushchev said in his report outline: "...all attempts by reformists and revisionists to 'improve' and beautify capitalism, and to cover up capitalism's obvious faults and antagonistic contradictions are futile. All conspiracies by revisionists to slander and distort Marxism and split the fraternal family of socialist countries are doomed to failure."

    "The seven-year plan is a devastating blow to bourgeois ideology, international reformism, and revisionism." There is an old Chinese saying: "Without destruction, there can be no construction." There can be absolutely no "peaceful coexistence" in the struggle of political thought.

    The 21st Congress of the CPSU will be a congress that will play a decisive role in the socialist camp winning victory in the peaceful competition with the capitalist imperialist camp. As a member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and as the Chinese people who are as close as brothers to the great Soviet people, we sincerely thank the Soviet Union's "communist economic construction" for "becoming... an example for socialist Europe and Asia" (Lenin), sincerely welcome the increasingly clear image of the communist building, and sincerely cheer: Long live the 21st Congress of the CPSU, which comprehensively develops communist construction, opens a new era in history, and becomes a grand festival for mankind!

    人类的盛大节
    日萧
  　三我们这一辈的人大概都还记得，当俄国十月革命爆发，苏维埃政权初建立起来的时候，从日本又传到中国来一个新名词：“过激派”“过激主义”。这就是那时候“波尔塞维克”“布尔塞维主义”的意译。
    帝国主义者、垄断资本家、大腹贾、工厂主、地主富豪们嗡嗡议论起来：过激主义是洪水猛兽，过激派杀人放火，共产共妻……由他们所雇佣和豢养的一些画家把波尔塞维克画成多么可怕可恶的样子呵！不是三头六臂，就是狼牙虎爪……他们的新闻记者、文人把苏维埃俄罗斯描写成饥寒交迫，暗无天日的世界……一句话：世界的末日到了，罪犯就是波尔塞维克，就是列宁和他的“过激党”……
    1919—1920年，西方对苏维埃俄罗斯的“舆论”，从两本书的名称就可以看出。一本是美国政论家罗伯特·威尔顿写的，叫“俄罗斯的垂死挣扎”；一本是英国科学幻想小说作家赫伯特·威尔斯写的，叫“黑暗里的俄国”。前者“预言”从经济观点看，苏维埃继续存在，是不可能的，从政治观点看，它是荒谬绝伦的；后者说，假如西方不去帮助俄国，那末，俄国“除了彻底毁灭现代文明的最后残余以外，没有任何其它前途”。
    正是向这位公认为大胆的幻想小说家，列宁打开了俄罗斯电气化“大胆的草案”。看来，这位英国客人的胆子并不够大，他虽然一时也被列宁的坚定乐观的信心所征服了，事后却说，列宁是个“空想家”……
    但另一位具有巨大才能和渊博素养的西方大作家罗曼·罗兰却说的不同，他认为列宁的幻想在于行动中。
    这比威尔斯的说法好得多了！是的，共产党人既敢于实践，干劲十足；也富于理想，雄心百倍。共产党人在立志改造世界的时候常常是把幻想和科学结合在一起的。用我们现在的话来说，革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义，从来就总是很好地结合在共产党人的身上。无论作政治、经济、文化、艺术……任何一项工作，都显示这种高尚可贵的品质。
    苏联在结束内战、驱逐十四个国家的干涉军之后，积极从事恢复那破坏得彻底的国民经济。在占地球六分之一的辽阔地面上，千千万万的老年壮年和青年男女以冲天的干劲进行了异常困难和坚决的工作。多少那个时代歌颂劳动的诗歌，至今背诵起来还使人鼓舞！你能说，保尔·柯察金只知道苦干硬干而没有远大理想么？没有幻想么？就在那时代产生了“共产主义的星期六”运动。就在那时候，列宁计划了全国的电气化和合作运动。
    几乎令人难以相信的是：在恢复1913年的工业生产水平、着手根本改造国民经济、开始执行第一个五年计划的时候，苏联比最发达的资本主义国家大约落后五十年到一百年；但是十年之后（列宁曾微笑地对威尔斯说：“十年以后请再来吧，看一看俄国在这时期作了些什么？”），到1930年，苏联已经做到了英国需要一百年才能做到的事！
    我自己在苏联差不多经历过第一、第二两个五年计划的时期，亲眼看到了苏联的社会主义建设是如何飞跃地发展的；也看到了苏维埃人能干的双手和豪迈的智慧如何同时并用、冷静的科学思想和飞翔的幻想如何紧密地结合在一起的。
    希特勒法西斯瘟疫打断了第三个五年计划，并且给苏联造成了莫大的灾难。但是战争一停，苏联人民在党的号召下又以神话般的速度恢复和扩大了自己的建设。到1958年，工业产量居欧洲第一位，世界第二位。1958年每一个月的钢产量和石油开采量比1913年全年还多！每三天的发电量等于沙俄时代全年的发电量！这不是又显示了苏维埃人的切实干劲和宏伟幻想的结合么？
    但是，这一切都已经是过去的事了；重要的，令人惊奇的还在后面，在今天和明天：——到伟大十月革命四十一周年和进入第四十二年度以内，在苏维埃的土地上出现了多少奇迹呵！单说三个人造地球卫星先后被送上了天，这已经震动了整个世界。而当第三个人造月亮还在绕着地球转的时候，作为1959年揭幕典礼和对苏共第二十一次代表大会的献礼，苏维埃人又发射了巨型宇宙火箭，它飞过月球，成了第一个人造太阳卫星！这不是破天荒的大事么？这不是神话变成了现实么？宜乎全体进步人类为之欢欣鼓舞。但一小撮和平的敌人为之瞠目结舌。
    事实是铁的证明：一方连发连中；一方百发不中。一方经济、文化、科学蒸蒸日上；一方危机、恐慌、失业、颓废、落后。一方如旭日东升、光芒万丈；一方如日落西山，黑夜茫茫。
    一方造谣诬蔑，加强冷战和颠复活动，或则东窜西撞，到处点火，其势凶凶，每次最后只好夹着尾巴逃跑，只好研究如何投降，如何守住阵势，挡住东风，如何挣脱绞索；一方则稳如泰山，仗义执言，扑灭战争火焰，捍卫世界和平，支援蓬勃发展的民族独立和人民解放运动，主张和平共处、和平竞赛。
    就在社会主义体制已经在世界上建立起来而殖民主义系统日益崩溃下去，也就是“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的时候，作为苏联人民争取共产主义胜利而斗争的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者，作为列宁曾经指出的，我们时代的智慧、荣誉、良心的苏联共产党召开第二十一次代表大会，讨论1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字。从我们已经读到的“赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次大会的报告提纲”看来，应该肯定，这是一次伟大苏联的创造力正处在空前繁荣时期召开的大会，是伟大苏联人民以坚定的步伐、满怀信心地沿着通往共产主义的道路前进的大会，是伟大苏联人民——不仅苏联人民——进入一个新的重要发展时期——全面展开共产主义建设的大会。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会要讨论的七年计划是“今后十五年发展国民经济的远景计划，是苏联共产主义建设的经济纲领”（报告提纲）的组成部分。想到这些，我们禁不住巨跃三百，招手欢呼：共产主义——人类最高最美的理想——已在不远了！
    当马克思和恩格斯共同著作“共产党宣言”的时候，共产主义还是个“幽灵”“在欧洲徘徊”，自然是走着偏僻的小道。但是从它出现以来，它的脚步一天天放大了，到后来它大踏步地走在地球上的五大洲和五大洋各处，而且发出宏亮的呼声来了。1917年10月它的宏亮的呼声，它的一声炮响，震动了世界，送来了马克思列宁主义，唤醒了中国、东方和世界一切被压迫的人民。四十多年以来这呼声朝朝暮暮萦绕人们的耳际，激动人们的心弦，启发人们的智慧，增强人们的信心和勇气。人们站立起来了，行动起来了，朝着一个方向前进、前进、再前进。任何力量都阻止不住他们的步伐，任何力量都不能使他们后退。
    今天共产主义高高地抬起了自己的头颅，屹立在东起太平洋，西到亚得里亚海岸——整个社会主义阵营——全世界四分之一的土地上面！
    尽管四十年来反共的先锋，前辈和后代（如杜勒斯之流）老在哇哇叫“共产主义威胁”……，人类的压倒多数——二十多亿！——谁都讨厌这种陈腔滥调，因为人们清楚地读到了和了解了赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲上所说的：“苏联及其他社会主义国家的成就，不仅不威胁任何人，反而是维护和平和各国人民安全的保证”。“社会主义国家所实行的和平与和平共处的政策绝不是偶然的、暂时的现象，这种政策是社会主义社会的有机产物。”他们也读到了：“在今后七年中……我们将要在社会主义经济向共产主义发展的道路上，为使社会主义经济的质量状况更加优越而完成一次新的跃进，为人民福利的进一步增长而大大提高苏联的经济潜力。”
  “七年计划是以沿着进步道路发展着的国民经济各个部门中的深刻质变为基础的。……由于生产力的蓬勃发展，在未来七年内将要完成大大提高人民生活水平和在国内建立充裕的物质福利的前提的任务，充裕的物质福利是‘……保证充分的福利和社会所有成员的自由而全面的发展’（列宁）所必要的。”
    试问，这怎么会是对别人的“威胁”呢？
    世界上压倒多数的人也清楚地听到和读到了：“为了向共产主义过渡，不仅需要强大的物质技术基础，而且需要社会主义社会全体公民高度的觉悟水平。……在共产主义建设过程中……人本身也发生了变化，人的共产主义世界观建立起来了。……”试问，这也“威胁”别人么？
    我们知道，要建立共产主义的世界观就必须和一切反共产主义的东西作坚决的斗争。我们完全拥护赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲里所说的：“……改良主义者和修正主义者企图‘改善’和美化资本主义、掩盖资本主义的明显的毛病和对抗性矛盾的一切企图都是徒劳无益的。修正主义者企图诽谤和歪曲马克思主义，分裂社会主义国家兄弟大家庭的一切阴谋都注定要归于失败。”
    “七年计划是对资产阶级思想、国际改良主义和修正主义的一次毁灭性的打击”。中国有句古话：不破不立。政治思想的斗争绝对不能“和平共处”。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会将是社会主义阵营在和资本帝国主义阵营和平竞赛中为获得胜利起决定性作用的大会。作为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一员的中华人民共和国，作为和伟大苏联人民亲如兄弟的中国人民，衷心感谢苏联的“共产主义经济建设”“成为……社会主义的欧洲和亚洲的榜样”（列宁），衷心欢迎那越来越鲜明的共产主义大厦的形象，衷心欢呼：全面展开共产主义建设、开辟历史新纪元并成为人类盛大节日的苏共第二十一次代表大会万岁！
