Turning Miscellaneous Wood and Wild Grass into Treasure

　　Forest product chemical industry in our country is a chemical processing industry that uses waste materials and forest special and by-products as its objects. It is also a new industry. Its scope is very broad. Currently, the main projects in our country include: rosin, tannin extract, wood dry distillation, wood hydrolysis, cork processing, aromatic oil, camphor, and maple sugar production.

　　In the forest, the raw materials available for forest product chemical industry processing are very abundant. According to relevant scientific data statistics, about five to seven tons of branches, leaves, and fruits fall per hectare of forest land every year; in logging areas, about 0.42 cubic meters of branches and other waste are discarded in the forest land for every cubic meter of timber harvested; when timber is processed, the sawdust left over per cubic meter accounts for about 8%. If one thousand cubic meters of logs are processed, about eighty cubic meters of sawdust can be obtained. These scraps, which originally had very little economic value, can be chemically processed to produce a large number of forest product chemical products with high economic value.

　　Waste wood and pine roots may seem to have no use value, but through dry distillation, they can be used to produce wood vinegar, wood tar, pine root oil, methanol, acetone, etc. One hundred and fifty catties of pine roots can be refined into thirty catties of crude oil, with an oil yield of 20%. Further fractionation can yield turpentine, mineral processing oil, pine tar, lubricating oil, and asphalt. Turpentine is an important raw material for the paint industry, mineral processing oil is used for the flotation of non-ferrous metals, and wood tar is an indispensable softening agent in the rubber industry. These oils have great uses in industry.

　　Sawdust may also seem like something that is not worth much, but it can be hydrolyzed to produce alcohol, white wine, and sugar. Fifteen cubic meters of sawdust can produce one ton of alcohol, and five tons of sawdust can produce one ton of 50-proof white wine, with a cost only one-fifteenth of that of making wine from grain. At the same time, lignin (a good raw material for bakelite and activated carbon) and gypsum are also obtained, and the waste liquid after distilling the wine can also be used as raw materials for feed yeast, acetic acid, and lactic acid. Sawdust contains starch, which is a polysaccharide compound, so sawdust can be used to make sugar. One ton of sawdust can produce 600 catties of sugar. The method is to remove impurities and separate after chemical treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid to obtain white crystalline sugar. Now, in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places, the extraction of glucose from sawdust has been successful. One ton of sawdust can extract more than 500 catties of glucose.

　　Turning these waste materials into wood pulp, and then processing them chemically, can also make rayon. In the past, spruce wood pulp was generally used to make rayon. One cubic meter of spruce can make 160 kilograms of rayon. During the Great Leap Forward, relevant units in Shanghai successfully used Masson's pine to trial-produce rayon. According to calculations by the Shanghai Anle Rayon Factory, about 32 kilograms of pulp can be made from 100 catties of pine wood, and about 80 kilograms of rayon can be made from 100 kilograms of pulp.

　　Camphor and camphor oil extracted from camphor trees are special products of our country and are mainly used in national defense, medicine, and celluloid industry. Camphor can also be distilled to extract valuable products such as white camphor oil, eucalyptus oil, pine oil yeast, and aromatic oil. These products are all important industrial raw materials and export goods.

　　In short, the raw materials for forest product chemical industry are inexhaustible, and its products are widely used in various industrial sectors. Moreover, the production technology of forest product chemistry is generally relatively simple. Therefore, it is an industry with broad development prospects.

    杂木野草变成宝
    林产化学工业在我国是以废材和森林特、副产为对象的化学加工工业，也是一项新兴的工业。它包括的范围很广，目前在我国主要的项目有：松香、栲胶、木材干馏、木材水解、栓皮加工、芳香油、樟脑和槭糖等生产。
    在森林里，可供林产化学工业加工的原料非常丰富。据有关科学资料统计，一公顷森林地带每年落下的枝叶、果实约有五吨到七吨；在采伐区里，每采伐一立方公尺木材就有零点四二立方公尺左右的枝桠等废弃在林地；木材进行加工时，每立方公尺所剩的锯末约占8％，如果加工一千立方公尺原木，可得锯末约八十立方公尺。这些原来经济价值极低的碎料，经过化学加工，就可制取大量经济价值很高的林产化学产品。
    废材和松根看起来好像没有什么使用价值，可是通过干馏，就可以制取醋石、木焦油、松根油、甲醇、丙酮等。一百五十斤的松根，可炼出三十斤原油，出油率为20％，再进一步分馏可得松节油、选矿油、松焦油、润滑油和沥青。松节油是油漆工业的重要原料，选矿油用于浮选有色金属，木焦油是橡胶工业上不可缺少的软化剂。这些油在工业上的用途都很大。
    锯末看起来也好像是并不值钱的东西，但是经过水解可以制酒精、白酒和糖。十五立方公尺的锯末可制酒精一吨，五吨锯末可制五十度白酒一吨，成本只等于用粮食造酒的十五分之一，同时还取得木素（电木、活性炭的好原料）和石膏，蒸酒后的废液还可作饲料酵母、醋酸、乳酸的原料。锯末里含有淀粉，淀粉是多糖化合物，所以锯末可以制糖，一吨锯末可以出糖六百斤，其方法是经过浓硫酸的化学处理后，去掉杂质，进行分离，就能得到白色的结晶糖。现在在上海、浙江等地用锯屑提炼葡萄糖已经成功，一吨锯屑可提炼葡萄糖五百多斤。
    把这些废材制成木浆，再经过化学处理，还可以制成人造丝。过去做人造丝一般都用云杉木浆，一立方公尺云杉可制人造丝一百六十公斤。在大跃进中，上海有关单位用毛尾松试制人造丝成功，据上海安乐人造丝厂计算，一百斤松材约可做三十二公斤浆粕，而一百公斤浆粕约可制成八十公斤人造丝。
    从樟树中提取的樟脑和樟油是我国的特产，主要用于国防、医药及赛璐珞工业。樟脑经过蒸馏，还可提取白樟油、桉叶油、松油酵、芳香油等有价值的产品。这些产品都是重要的工业原料和出口物资。
    总之，林产化学工业原料取之不尽、用之不竭，其产品却广泛地用于各种工业部门，而林产化学的生产技术一般又比较简单，因此，它是一项有着广阔发展前途的工业。
