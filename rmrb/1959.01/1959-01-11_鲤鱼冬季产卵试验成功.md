Successful Winter Spawning Experiment with Carp

    (Reported by this newspaper) Winter spawning of carp has been successfully tested. Under the climatic conditions of Central China, carp do not spawn in winter, but the great development of aquaculture throughout the country requires a constant supply of more fish fry throughout the year. In order to solve this contradiction, the Huama Lake Workstation of the Institute of Hydrobiology successfully experimented on December 8th with a method to make carp spawn in winter. By December 22nd, a total of eight batches of carp had spawned in three ponds one after another, and more than 30,000 healthy fish fry had been hatched.

    The winter spawning of carp is divided into two steps. The first is to promote the maturation of carp gonads, and the second is to promote their ovulation. We have adopted a combination of increasing water temperature, injecting carp pituitary glands, and stimulating with flowing water. After about six to twelve days, the carp naturally spawn at a water temperature of 15 to 18 degrees Celsius.

    The successful winter spawning experiment of carp has opened up broad avenues for year-round fish fry production.

    鲤鱼冬季产卵试验成功
    本报讯　鲤鱼冬季产卵试验成功。在华中地区的气候条件下，鲤鱼在冬季是不产卵的，但是各地水产养殖事业的大发展却要求常年有更多的鱼苗供应。为了解决这个矛盾，水生生物研究所花马湖工作站在12月8日试验成功使鲤鱼冬季产卵的办法。到12月22日，已有三个池塘先后共八批鲤鱼产了卵，并已孵出体质健壮的鱼苗三万余尾。
    鲤鱼冬季产卵工作分为两个步骤，首先是促使鲤鱼性腺成熟，其次是促使其排卵，我们采取了提高水温、注射鲤鱼脑下垂体以及流水刺激三者结合的办法。经过大约六至十二天后，鲤鱼在水温摄氏十五度至十八度的条件下即自然产卵。
    鲤鱼冬季产卵的试验成功，为四季生产鱼苗开辟了广阔的道路。
