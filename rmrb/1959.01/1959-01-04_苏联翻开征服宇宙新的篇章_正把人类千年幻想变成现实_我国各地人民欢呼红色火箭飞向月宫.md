Beijing listeners, proud of this great achievement of the Soviet people and all humanity, were beaming with joy. Everyone wanted to convey this good news to more and more people as soon as possible. Many institutions, schools, and enterprises' broadcasters automatically rebroadcast the news to all personnel. Some people simply took out paper and pens, writing summaries of the news as big-character posters and drawing propaganda posters to paste on the streets. A big-character poster on Dongdan Avenue was titled "Soviet Space Rocket Flies Directly to the Lunar Palace to Meet Chang'e," and a propaganda poster near the zoo depicted a giant on the space rocket shaking hands with the old man of the moon. When two such reports appeared on Wangfujing Street, pedestrians surged forward, instantly forming two dense circles of people. In front of the big-character posters, people jostled to read, discussing as they read.

Many scientists, while awaiting further reports, were constantly answering inquiries from visitors. Many factories, enterprises, and schools held discussion meetings, some even writing poems and drawing pictures to congratulate the Soviet Union on another great initiative following the successful launch of three artificial Earth satellites in the past two years. Workers at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant printed 450 "special editions" in red characters on yellow paper and distributed them to all employees. Workers at the North China Radio Factory expressed warm congratulations to the Soviet experts working at the factory.

Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, personally announced the news of the Soviet Union's launch of the space rocket at a scientific discussion held at the university, and the entire faculty and students applauded for seven or eight minutes. Many classes at Beijing Normal University held celebrations to congratulate the great achievements of Soviet science and praise the immense power of the world's peace forces. Teachers and students at Peking University jumped for joy upon hearing this good news.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd: People from all walks of life in Tianjin are cheering and congratulating the Soviet Union on the launch of a giant space rocket.

Workers at the Tianjin Electronic Instrument Factory were overjoyed upon hearing the news, with many jumping for joy. Workers in the assembly workshop and technical section immediately gathered in front of the loudspeakers to celebrate.

People in Tianjin's science and technology circles held celebration gatherings.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: The news of the Soviet Union's launch of a giant space rocket to the moon has greatly inspired the people of Guangzhou.

Many university students in Guangzhou today marched in groups, beating gongs and drums to spread the good news.

The troops on the Fujian front line read the extra edition rushed out by the Xiamen Daily on the front line. Although today is an odd day, and the artillery fire on the front line is constant, the officers and soldiers could not suppress their excitement. Liao Yanfa, a student of a certain artillery school interning in an artillery company, said that the myth of "Chang'e flying to the moon" has been realized. "Chang'e" is the Soviet-launched space rocket.

When the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the frontline naval gunboat troops heard the news from the radio, cheers and applause immediately rang out on the gunboats and wharves. Sailors who were having lunch put down their bowls and chopsticks, and sailors who were repairing machines temporarily stopped their work and gathered around the radio to listen.

Liu Biao, political commissar of a certain naval unit, said that the Soviet Union's launch of a multi-stage space rocket once again proves that the Soviet Union has left capitalist countries far behind in scientific endeavors, and this also tells the people of the world that the socialist system is incomparably superior.
