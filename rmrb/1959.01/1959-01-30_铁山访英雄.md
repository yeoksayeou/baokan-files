    Visiting Heroes on Iron Mountain
    By our reporter, Sun Minghui

    Leaving the coal and iron city of Benxi and heading southeast for 32.5 kilometers, we traversed the towering mountains covered with glistening white snow and arrived at the renowned Nanfen Open-Pit Iron Mine. This is one of China's older iron mines with over 40 years of mining history. It was formerly called Miao'ergou Iron Mine, primarily utilizing underground mining. It was renamed to its current name after being rebuilt into a modern open-pit mine in early 1957. It is a powerful "grain" base for China's steel industry. In addition to fully satisfying the iron smelting needs of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's blast furnaces, it also supplies some ore to Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other steel enterprises.

    We sat in a green jeep belonging to the mine, and drove along the winding mountain road, 13 li in length, towards the summit. The road was winding, steep and slippery, but the jeep drove quickly. Halfway up the mountain, we could hear the clatter of machinery from the top, and giant trucks loaded with ore were shuttling down the mountain. We looked around, with mountains piled upon mountains, and the white snow glittering in the sunlight. The guide told us that the mine being currently exploited is called "Iron Mountain" by the older folks. Exploration has proved that the ore vein of "Iron Mountain" extends to the two large mountains opposite and to the left rear, and its reserves are unimaginable. According to legend, the shape of the iron ore vein in this area resembles a large cow. "Iron Mountain", which has been mined for more than 40 years, is only a small tail of the cow. The jeep drove for about 20 minutes before we finally arrived at the mine.

    A New Starting Point

    In front of the mine office, red flags were waving, and on the competition boards in the workshops and workers' rest rooms, slogans and resolutions of determination, challenges and responses written in colorful paper by the miners, as well as the latest achievement tables were posted. It turned out that in recent days, the workers throughout the mine have launched a vigorous high-yield competition, striving to win a beautiful victory in the first quarter of this year, and lay the foundation for over-fulfilling the annual ore production plan. The planned ore production for the first quarter has been increased by more than double compared to the same period last year. If the first quarter plan is completed, the annual production will be confidently based on doubling last year's output to achieve a new leap forward.

    The responsible comrades at the mine highly praised the workers' soaring enthusiasm. He said that from the first day of 1959, the workers have been engaged in intense combat, and new heroic deeds are constantly emerging. Since January, there have been several snowfalls, and the weather has been freezing, with the lowest temperature reaching over 30 degrees Celsius below zero, bringing great difficulties to open-pit operations. However, the thousands of workers fighting here, regardless of the harsh climate, have never stopped working. They loudly proclaimed: The cold weather cannot cool our fiery hearts, and no difficulty can stop the working class. In the battle against the weather, the level of production is constantly improving. Recently, the average daily output of ore has exceeded the level of the best-producing fourth quarter of last year. In the past week, more than 100 high-yield records have appeared throughout the mine. On the way, we encountered several groups of people, beating gongs and drums, sending honorary flowers to those who created new achievements.

    Iron-Armed Giant

    Leaving the mine office, we came to the 118 electric shovel working platform face, and saw the large electric shovel known as the "iron-armed giant," using its huge palm to load more than six tons of ore into a truck at a time. A 25-ton truck can be filled with just four scoops. There are more than a dozen such large electric shovels in the entire mine, completely replacing human hands.

    No matter how good the machine is, it still requires people to skillfully operate it to create miracles. Therefore, the real "iron-armed giants" are the electric shovel operators who possess endless wisdom and technical talent. Zhang Benren, the driver in the cab of the 118 electric shovel, is an old worker who started as an apprentice at the age of twelve and is now only 24 years old. Although he had no opportunity to study from an early age, he painstakingly studied for more than a year and became a skilled electric shovel operator. For more than a year, he and his partners in the same machine have created the advanced experience of the mixed work team, reformed the equipment, making the 118 electric shovel one of the most advanced electric shovels in the country. Since last year, the average amount of ore loaded per shift has reached 1,513 tons, more than doubling the efficiency in 1957, creating the highest record for large electric shovels in the country. Leaving the 118 electric shovel, we met Xu Wencai, the driver of the 115 electric shovel, on another step face. Although he still looks like a child, the advanced operating experiences such as "double-row loading method and fast loading method" he and other electric shovel drivers have jointly created have been promoted throughout the mine and become famous electric shovel workers.

    Explosion Hero

    Underground blasting is an important part of the production process in open-pit iron mines. Originally, the ore layer was very hard. Only by blasting the ore and rock into small pieces with explosives can the electric shovel exert its power in loading trucks. When the electric shovel drivers talked to us, they constantly mentioned the achievements of the blasters. We were just about to go and see the blasting workers when someone told us to take cover because blasting was about to take place. After we found a safe place, we suddenly heard a deafening roar, and a large cloud of black smoke mixed with sparks rose into the sky, reaching several meters high, with sand and stones flying, and the smell of gunpowder filled the air. For a moment, it seemed that the entire mountain was about to be lifted up, making the newcomers here startled. Someone told us that this was a large blast. It is estimated that this time, more than 100,000 tons of ore and rock were blasted down. In the past, the maximum was 150,000 tons, which could fill 5,000 train cars.

    We soon found the blasting worker Liu Youzuo, who has six years of blasting history and is a red flag bearer in the mine. He told us that after the workers' research, the blasting efficiency has now doubled compared to the past. The production efficiency of the hole-drilling and rock-drilling workers has also greatly improved, creating favorable conditions for blasting. In the past, they only placed explosives in a flat tunnel under a vertical well that was a dozen meters deep, and the efficiency was not high enough. Later, they painstakingly researched and drilled two flat tunnels under the vertical well to place explosives, resulting in powerful blasts. Now the workers are studying the method of placing explosives in three or four flat tunnels, so the efficiency will be greatly improved.

    Blasting workers are all agile and brave people. Their work is very dangerous and also very arduous. Rock drilling workers have to drill into a well hole that can only accommodate one person, laboriously chiseling the hard rock one by one. After the well hole is drilled, the blasting workers have to go down to place explosives and fill it. The air in the well is thin, filled with a choking smell of gunpowder, making it difficult to work. Especially when placing explosives, they must be handled gently and carefully, and no negligence is allowed. It can be said that they must be bold and careful. However, the workers' enthusiasm is very high. They said that as long as a large amount of ore is produced to ensure a large increase in steel production, they are willing to do work that is ten times harder, which indeed demonstrates the heroic nature.

    Vanguard of a Strong Army

    The large amount of ore blasted down must be transported to the chute and placed in the crushing yard halfway down the mountain to be crushed before it can be transported to the concentrator for beneficiation as a finished product. This task falls on the shoulders of the truck drivers. This is a job that requires skillful techniques and a high degree of responsibility. The mountain road is steep and slippery. Pedestrians can easily slip and fall, let alone the huge trucks with rubber tires as tall as a person. However, when we visited the step faces, we saw the trucks, which were almost as large as a train car, shuttling back and forth on the snow-covered and icy mountain road, making people admire the drivers' talents.

    Almost every driver can tell a story of fighting against difficulties. Driving here is very different from driving on the plains. The natural conditions on the high mountains are very inconvenient for driving. In addition to rain and snow, there is also strong wind and fog, especially during the spring and autumn seasons when fog is at its peak. On rainy and snowy days and at night, after the fog descends, it is often impossible to see your fingers, making driving very difficult, especially since one side of the road is a cliff of ten thousand feet, and there is a risk to life if you are not careful. However, the drivers have withstood the test. Like a vanguard of a strong army, they bravely and skillfully fought against difficulties and never interrupted transportation due to the obstruction of natural conditions.

    Truck drivers have come up with many ways to ensure smooth transportation. Jia Baozhong, a driver who has been driving for more than 20 years, told us that on snowy nights and nights with heavy fog, they light bonfires at the bends of the road to guide the trucks forward. They form nighttime driving groups, with all trucks going and returning together to avoid collisions. At this time, road maintenance workers and miners also come to support, paving the road stones with sand and gravel to reduce slipperiness. Not long ago, he and other drivers went out on a night with wind, snow, and heavy fog. Although there were bonfires and lights to guide the way, it was still difficult to recognize the road surface, so they raised the driver's seat as if standing up, and stretched their heads out of the car window to observe the road. Despite the howling wind and snow outside, they persisted in driving, and no one stopped.

    Innovation Expert

    After visiting the mine, we followed the road down the mountain and came to the crushing yard located underground halfway up the mountain. Here, the ore is crushed by crushers to a certain particle size, placed in the ore storage bin, and then transported away by electric locomotives. This is the last process of ore production.

    The lights in the machine room flickered, and the jaw crusher, like a black monster, opened its huge basin-like mouth, swallowing and crushing thousands of tons of ore, and then spitting it out. The workers said that after continuous improvement by the innovation experts, this machine can crush more than 1,200 tons of ore per hour, more than doubling its original design capacity, meeting the needs of increased ore production.

    During the visit, we met Tang Gengrong, an old worker with more than 30 years of service. He is one of the workers who made a significant contribution to improving the crusher. He successively improved the important parts of the crusher, such as the iron grate and the trailer, greatly reducing the machine's maintenance time and eliminating minor repairs. He innovated the crusher's discharge port, reducing the ore particle size from 500 cubic millimeters to 250 cubic millimeters, which played a significant role in improving the quality and output of concentrate in the concentrator. In the past year or so, he has implemented more than 30 important technical innovations. Old worker Liu Xingqi is also a person who dares to think, speak, and act. The plate feeder in the previous process of the crusher had low efficiency, affecting the improvement of the crusher's production capacity. To solve this problem, he continuously proposed suggestions for innovating the motor speed twice, but they were opposed by the主管 technical personnel, who believed that changing the original design would cause accidents. After continuous research, he proposed the innovation suggestion for the third time. With the support of the Party organization, the experiment was successful. The motor speed was increased from more than 900 revolutions per minute to more than 1,400 revolutions per minute, overcoming the weak link.

    When we finished visiting the entire mine, it was already dusk. Walking out of the electromechanical workshop and looking at Iron Mountain, the entire mountain was full of lights, and the workers on the mine were engaging in an arduous night battle with nature. (Attached picture)

    铁山访英雄
    本报记者　孙铭惠
    从煤铁之城本溪出发，向东南行三十二公里半，穿过复盖着皑皑白雪的崇山峻岭，我们来到了著名的南芬露天铁矿。这是具有四十多年开采历史的我国较老的铁矿之一，过去叫庙儿沟铁矿，主要是井下开采；1957年初改建成为现代化的露天矿之后，方称现在的名字。它是我国钢铁工业的一个强大的“粮食”基地，生产的矿石，除了全部满足本溪钢铁公司高炉炼铁用以外，一部分还供应鞍山钢铁公司等钢铁企业。
    我们坐着矿里的绿色吉普车，延着长达十三华里的盘山公路，向山顶驰去。公路千曲万折，又陡又滑，吉普车行得却很快。走到半山腰，从山上传来了轧轧的机器声，一辆辆载着矿石的巨型汽车，从山上穿梭般开了下来。我们四下远眺，重山叠岭，白雪在阳光下闪射着光芒。响导告诉我们，正在开采的矿山，年龄老一点的人都叫它“铁山”，勘探证明，“铁山”的矿脉延伸到对面和左后方的两座大山里，其储量之多可想而知。据传说，这一带的铁矿矿脉形状像一头大牛，已经开采了四十多年的“铁山”，还只是大牛的一条小尾巴。吉普车约走了二十多分钟，我们才来到了矿场。
    新的起点
    矿场办公室前边，红旗招展，在车间和各工种工人休息室的竞赛牌上，张贴着用五颜六色彩纸写成的矿工们的决心书、挑战和应战书，以及最新的成绩表。原来，这些天来整个矿山上的职工们已经展开了一个轰轰烈烈的高产竞赛，争取在今年第一季度里打一个漂亮的胜仗，给超额完成全年矿石生产计划打下基础。第一季度的矿石计划产量比去年同期增加了一倍以上，完成了第一季度计划，全年的生产就有把握在去年翻番的基础上来一个新的跃进。
    矿场上的负责同志对矿工们的冲天干劲极力称赞，他说，从1959年的第一天起，工人们就投入了紧张的战斗，新的英雄事迹不断涌现。1月份以来，这里下了几场雪，天寒地冻，最低温度达到摄氏零下三十多度，给露天作业带来了很大的困难。但是战斗在这里的上千名职工，不论在什么恶劣的气候下，始终没有停止工作。他们响亮地提出：天冷冷不了火热的心，再难难不倒工人阶级。在同天气的搏斗中，生产水平正不断提高，最近以来，每天矿石的平均产量，已经超过了去年生产最好的第四季度的水平。在最近一周内，全矿已经出现了一百多个高产纪录。我们在路上，就碰到好几起人群，敲锣打鼓，给创造新成就的人送光荣花。
    铁臂巨人
    从矿场办公室出来，我们来到一一八号电铲工作的台阶工作面，看到那个被人称为“铁臂巨人”的大电铲，正在用它的巨掌，一次把六吨多的矿石装到汽车里，一辆二十五吨的载重汽车，只要四次就可以装满。全矿像这样的大电铲共有十多台，完全代替了人的双手。
    不论什么样好的机器，还得人来熟练的驾驶它，才能创造出奇迹。因此真正的“铁臂巨人”，还是那些具有无穷智慧和技术才能的电铲操纵手们。坐在一一八号电铲驾驶室里的司机张本仁，是一个从十二岁起就当学徒、现在只有二十四岁的老工人，虽然从小没有机会念书，可是只用了一年多的时间，苦心钻研，就成了一名熟练的电铲手。一年多来，他与他同机的伙伴们创造了混合工作队的先进经验，改革了设备，使一一八号电铲成为全国最先进的电铲之一，去年以来，每班装矿量平均达到一千五百一十三吨，比1957年效率提高了两倍多，创造了全国大型电铲的最高纪录。离开一一八号电铲，我们在另一个台阶工作面遇到了一一五号电铲司机徐文才，虽然看起来他还是一个小孩子，但是他同其他电铲司机共同创造的“双排装法及快速装车法”等先进操作经验，已在全矿推广，成为有名的电铲工人。
    爆炸英雄
    地下爆破，是露天铁矿生产过程中一个重要的环节。原来矿层十分坚硬，只有用炸药把矿石和岩石炸成碎块，电铲才能发挥装车的威力。电铲司机同我们谈话时，不时的提到爆炸手们的功绩。我们正打算去看看爆破工人，有人叫我们隐蔽起来，因为就要爆破了。我们找到了一个安全场所后，突然听到一阵轰然巨响，大股夹着点点火星的黑色浓烟，冲天腾起，高达几丈，砂石横飞，药味扑鼻，一时整个山顶像都要抬起来似的，使初来这里的人惊心动魄。有人告诉我们，这是一次大爆破，估计这一次炸下的矿石和岩石足有十多万吨，过去最多一次曾崩下矿石和岩石十五万吨，可以装满五千个火车车皮。
    我们不久找到了爆破工人刘有作，他已有六年的爆破历史，是矿里的红旗手。他告诉我们，经过工人们钻研，现在爆破效率比过去提高了一倍。穿孔和凿岩的工人的生产效率也大大提高，给爆破创造了有利条件。过去，他们只在十几公尺深的立井下边一个平井里放炸药，效率不够高；以后他们苦心研究，在立井下边凿成两个平井放炸药，从而出现了威力强大的爆破。现在工人又在研究在三个或四个平井里放药的方法，这样效率还将大大提高。
    爆破工人都是一些机敏而又勇敢的人。他们的工作危险性很大，也很艰苦。凿岩工人要钻进只能容一个人的井洞里艰苦地一下一下凿着硬岩，爆炸工人要在井洞凿好后下去放炸药和充填。井下空气稀薄，弥漫着呛人的药味，工作起来很困难。特别是放药时，又要轻拿轻放，一点都不能疏忽，真所谓胆大心细。但是工人们热情都十分高，他们表示，只要生产出大量矿石，保证钢铁大增产，比这再苦十倍的工作他们也愿干，这的确表现了英雄本色。
    劲旅先锋
    爆破下来的大量矿石，还必须运到溜子口放到山下半腰的破碎场破碎，才能作为成品运到选矿厂精选，这个任务落到了汽车司机们的肩上。这是一件需要熟练技巧和高度责任心的工作。盘山公路又陡又滑，行人一不小心都有滑倒的危险，何况胶轮有一个人高的身躯庞大的汽车。但是我们参观各台阶工作面时，看着这种差不多同一个火车皮拉得一样多的载重汽车，在积雪成冰的盘山公路上，往来如梭，使人不得不佩服司机们的才能。
    差不多每个司机都可以讲一段同困难搏斗的故事，这里行车同山下大不相同，高山上的自然条件对行车十分不便，除了雨雪之外，就是风大雾多，尤其春秋时节更是雾的旺季。雨雪天和夜晚，下雾之后往往伸手不见五指，行车十分艰难，特别是公路的一边都是万丈悬崖，一不小心就有生命危险。但是司机们经受了考验，他们像一支劲旅的先锋一样，勇敢、机智地同困难搏斗，从来没有因为自然条件的阻挠而中断运输。
    汽车司机们为了运输畅通，想出了许多办法。开了二十多年汽车的司机贾宝忠告诉我们，在大雪和降雾的夜晚，他们就在公路拐弯的地方生起一堆堆篝火，指引汽车前进；编成夜间行车小组，所有汽车同去同回、避免互相碰车；在这个时候，养路工人和矿工们也来支援，把路石用砂石垫起来，减少滑性。不久前，他同其他司机们在一个风雪交加、浓雾弥漫的夜晚出车，虽有篝火和灯光引路，认识路面还是困难，于是就把司机座位垫高，像站起一样，又把头伸出车窗外观察道路；尽管外边寒风怒吼，沙雪扑脸，他们还是坚持驾驶，谁也没有停车。
    革新能手
    我们参观完了矿场后，顺着公路下山，来到了设在半山腰地下的破碎场。这里把矿石用破碎机破碎到一定大小的粒度，放到贮矿槽里，再由电机车运走。这是矿石生产的最后一个工序。
    机器房里灯光闪闪，像黑色怪物一样的鄂式破碎机，张着巨盆般的大嘴，把成千上万吨矿石吞进嘴里弄碎，然后又吐出来。工人们说，这台机器经过革新能手们不断改进，每小时能破碎矿石一千二百多吨，比原设计能力提高了一倍以上，适应了矿石产量增长的需要。
    参观中我们遇到了有三十多年工龄的老工人唐更荣。他就是对提高破碎机有重大贡献的工人中的一个。他先后改进了破碎机的铁篦子、拖架等重要机件，使机器检修时间大大减少，并且消灭了小修；他革新了破碎机的排矿口，使矿石粒度由五百立方公厘缩减到二百五十立方公厘，对选矿厂提高精矿质量和产量，起了很大的作用。一年多来他实现的重要的技术革新就有三十多项。老工人刘兴起也是一位敢想敢说敢干的人。破碎机前一道工序板式给矿机效率低，影响破碎机生产能力的提高；为解决这个问题，他连续两次提出革新马达转数的建议，但是都遭到了主管技术人员的反对，认为改变原设计会出事故。经过不断研究，他又第三次提出革新建议，在党组织支持下，试验成功，马达转数由原来每分钟九百多转提高到一千四百多转，克服了薄弱环节。
    我们参观完了整个矿山，已是夜色蒙胧的时候。走出机电车间向铁山望去，满山一片灯火，矿山上的工人们正在同大自然进行一场艰苦的夜战。（附图片）
