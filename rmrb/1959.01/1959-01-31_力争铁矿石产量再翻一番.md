Strive to Double Iron Ore Production Again

In the 1958 Great Leap Forward, which took steel as the key link, iron ore enterprises across the country, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, implemented the policy of "walking on two legs," broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and deeply developed mass movements. This resulted in an unprecedented increase in iron ore production in China, with the output of key mining enterprises alone increasing by 90% compared to the actual output in 1957.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed that in 1959, China's steel production level would reach 18 million tons, and pig iron production would also increase significantly. To ensure the needs of the 1959 steel leap forward, iron ore production must also undergo a greater leap forward. According to preliminary calculations, the ore production of existing key mining enterprises in 1959 must increase by another 90% compared to 1958, and the production of concentrate powder must increase by another 92% compared to 1958. At the same time, in order to improve the quality of steel products, the quality of raw materials must also be improved. It is clear that the great leap forward in steel production has placed very important and arduous tasks on mining enterprises, both in terms of ore production and in improving raw material quality.

To ensure the doubling of ore production in 1959 and to improve the quality of raw materials, existing key mining enterprises must focus on increasing mining intensity, firmly grasp the weak links in production, improve equipment utilization efficiency, improve production labor organization, and improve mining and beneficiation processes and technical operation methods, and strive to tap existing production potential. On the other hand, it is necessary to rely on the foundation of existing mining enterprises to vigorously increase new production capacity. One method is for each mine, where conditions permit, to continue to establish "satellite mines" around its periphery, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from small scale and developing into large-scale or small-scale mechanized operations. The second method is to select mining areas with larger reserves and convenient construction in the large mining area or its periphery, and carry out formal mine expansion or new construction projects. Vigorously tapping existing production potential and seizing the opportunity to increase new production capacity are the basic ways for existing production mining enterprises to ensure the doubling of ore production in 1959.

To double ore production, we cannot rely solely on increasing the labor force, labor intensity, and increasing mechanical power equipment. At present, China's national economy is in a period of comprehensive leap forward with steel as the key link, and various fronts in industry, agriculture, and transportation require a lot of labor and mechanical power equipment. In this case, if we simply place the hope of doubling production on increasing the labor force and equipment, it is not only unrealistic, but also should not be done. The basic way out is that, in addition to striving to increase the labor force and equipment under possible conditions, the main thing is to actively carry out in-depth and extensive technical revolution movements in mining methods, operating techniques, equipment utilization, and production labor organization.

To carry out technical revolution in mining enterprises, we must vigorously promote mass movements. The masses are the masters of production, they have a deep understanding of the problems existing in production technology, and they have rich practical experience. The experience of Nanfen Iron Mine of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 proves that as long as the vast number of employees are allowed to study and propose technical revolution topics, and around the key issues of production technology, organize the masses to carry out large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions with both ideological and technical content; put the results of discussions and debates into experiments, and then bring the problems that occur in the experiments back for discussion and research, then the technical revolution can have immediate results and production can be greatly improved.

Although the production technology organization of modern mining enterprises is relatively strict and the degree of mechanization is relatively high, and the existing production organization, process flow, operation methods, and technical specifications are relatively complex, it cannot be said that no new technology can be reformed to increase new productivity. On the contrary, modern mines have even greater production potential. The problem lies in whether or not to vigorously promote mass movements for technical revolution to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, cadres, and technical personnel. Without mass movements, it is one situation, production is normal, but there is no great leap forward. When mass movements are launched, it is another situation, inventions and creations, technical reforms emerge, and a vigorous great leap forward comes. Therefore, we must continue to oppose conservatism, continue to break down superstitions, and promote the communist style, and extensively and deeply carry out mass technical revolution movements. This is the central link in greatly increasing iron ore production, and we must grasp it well.

Not only in the technical revolution, but also in all other aspects of mining work, we must conscientiously implement the mass line and vigorously promote mass movements. This is the fundamental guarantee for doubling production again in 1959. All important issues in the activities of mining enterprises, such as the determination of annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans and various measures, as well as the resolution of other major issues, must be launched by the masses. We must conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and strive to closely combine the production activities and production management of the broad masses. Not only must we mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job in production, but we must also care about the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of employees, and ensure a proper combination of work and rest.

The mass movement of technical revolution in mines should focus on the key problems in current production technology. In mining, the main objects of the technical revolution are: high-efficiency mining methods that do not mainly increase equipment; high-efficiency drilling and blasting technology based on existing technical equipment; improving the utilization rate of mining and beneficiation equipment; improving the intra-mine transportation system and increasing the loading capacity of intra-mine transportation; improving production labor organization and increasing the labor productivity of various types of work. In beneficiation, the technical revolution should mainly focus on increasing production (concentrate powder production) and improving quality (iron content), improving the operating rate and production capacity of crushing, ball milling and beneficiation machines, improving the existing beneficiation process, creating economical and suitable flotation reagents, improving the recovery rate of beneficiation, and studying breakthroughs in the beneficiation technology of oxidized ores. In mining enterprises with a low degree of mechanization and where manual labor still plays a major role, the technical revolution must also make great efforts in reducing labor intensity and improving and creating more efficient mining and transportation tools and equipment.

In the movement to strive for another doubling of production in mining enterprises, we must also, according to the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, grasp everything comprehensively and make all links in the production process leap forward together. While vigorously increasing mining intensity, we must also complete the amount of stripping work (open-pit mines) and the amount of roadway cutting work (underground mines) according to plan and proportionally, so that mining and mining preparation can advance in proportion. Not only should we pay attention to increasing the amount of mining, excavation, and stripping, but also pay attention to improving the intra-mine transportation capacity, strengthening the organization and scheduling of loading and transportation, so that the amount of mining, excavation, stripping and transportation are roughly balanced. Not only must we ensure the completion of the planned quantity of products, but we must also ensure the completion of the quality indicators of ore and concentrate powder. On the one hand, we must vigorously give play to the effectiveness of existing equipment and improve equipment utilization, and on the other hand, we must strengthen maintenance and conduct planned repairs. Under the circumstances of relatively tight situations in all aspects of the production leap forward, we must pay special attention to strengthening safety work and earnestly achieve "a great leap forward in production, with safety guaranteed." In short, in the great leap forward to strive for another doubling of iron ore production, we must make the leadership's attention and the organization and management of production technology work take into account all aspects of things as much as possible, neither fearing imbalance, nor striving to achieve positive balance.

In the glorious and victorious 1958, the production capacity of steel smelting greatly increased. In order to meet the needs of the steel production leap forward, in addition to strengthening the construction of new mines, at present and in the next few years, we must mainly rely on existing production mines, that is to say, existing mining enterprises are still the main source of raw materials to ensure steel production. Therefore, existing mining enterprises must bravely shoulder this glorious and arduous task and make great efforts to ensure the supply of raw materials for 18 million tons of steel. Of course, although existing mines face difficulties in completing the task of doubling production, as long as we despise all difficulties strategically, pay attention to difficulties tactically, and take various effective measures to address the current problems, we can overcome difficulties. Marx once said: "This way of overcoming difficulties is itself the realization of freedom." This year, in the great leap forward in mining production, we must continue to conscientiously implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, conscientiously strengthen political and ideological work, continue to go all out, oppose conservatism, and greatly promote the fighting spirit of relying on the masses and self-reliance to overcome difficulties. This is the fundamental guarantee for completing the task of doubling production in 1959. In the Great Leap Forward last year, we gained more experience in this regard, which should be summarized and further implemented in this year's Great Leap Forward.

We believe that on the basis of the victory in 1958, we will certainly complete the glorious and important task in 1959. Let us, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, fight for a greater leap forward in achieving another doubling of iron ore production this year.

    力争铁矿石产量再翻一番
    在1958年以钢为纲的全民大跃进中，全国各地铁矿企业，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻执行了“两条腿走路”的方针，破除了迷信，解放了思想，和深入开展群众运动，使我国铁矿石产量有了空前的增长，其中仅重点矿山企业的产量就比1957年的实际产量增长了90％。
    党的八届六中全会提出，1959年我国钢的生产水平将达到一千八百万吨，生铁产量也相应地有极大的增长。为保证1959年钢铁跃进的需要，铁矿石的生产也必须来一个更大的跃进。根据初步计算，现有重点矿山企业1959年的矿石产量，必须较1958年再增长90％，精矿粉的产量必须较1958年再增长92％。同时，为了提高钢铁产品的质量，也要提高原料质量。由此可见，钢铁生产的大跃进，不管是在矿石产量或是在改善原料质量方面，都给矿山企业提出了十分重大而艰巨的任务。
    为保证1959年矿石产量翻一番和改善原料质量，一方面现有的重点矿山企业，必须以提高采矿强度为中心，狠狠地抓住生产中的薄弱环节，提高设备利用效能，改善生产劳动组织，改善采矿、选矿工艺过程和技术操作方法，努力挖掘现有生产潜力。另一方面，必须依靠现有矿山企业的基础，努力增加新的生产能力。方法之一，是各矿山在条件许可的情况下，在其外围继续大办土洋结合、由小到大或小型机械化的“卫星矿山”；方法之二，就是在大型矿山本区或其外围地区，选取储量较多和便于建设的矿区，进行正规的矿山扩建或新建工程。努力挖掘现有生产潜力和抓紧增加新的生产能力，这就是现有生产矿山企业，保证1959年矿石产量再翻一番的基本途径。
    为使矿石产量翻一番，不能只依靠增加劳动力、劳动强度和增加机械动力设备。目前我国国民经济正处在以钢为纲全面跃进的时期，工业、农业、交通各个战线上都需要很多劳动力和机械动力设备。在此情况下，如果我们把产量翻一番的希望单纯寄托在增加劳动力和设备上，不仅是不现实的，而且也是不应该的。基本出路在于，除争取在可能条件下增加劳动力和设备外，主要是应该在采矿方法、操作技术、设备利用和生产劳动组织等方面，积极开展深入而广泛的技术革命运动。
    要在矿山企业中实行技术革命，就必须大搞群众运动。群众是生产中的主人，他们对生产技术中存在的问题具有深刻的体会，又具有丰富的实际经验。本溪钢铁公司南芬铁矿1958年大跃进的经验证明，只要让广大职工研究和提出技术革命课题，围绕着生产技术关键问题，组织群众开展既有思想又有技术内容的大鸣、大放和大辩论；把讨论争辩的结果付诸试验，把试验中发生的问题再拿来讨论研究。那末，技术革命就能立竿见影，生产就能大大提高。
    虽然近代矿山企业的生产技术组织比较严密，机械化程度较高，现有生产组织、工艺过程、操作方法和技术规范也都比较复杂，但不能因此就说再不能革新技术增加新的生产力了。相反，近代化矿山所拥有的生产潜力更大。问题在于是不是大搞技术革命的群众运动，把工人、干部、技术人员的积极性、创造性都动员起来。群众运动没有起来，是一种局面，生产照常，但没有什么大跃进。群众运动起来了，又是一种局面，发明创造，技术改革应运而生，轰轰烈烈的大跃进就来了。因此，还必须继续反对保守，继续破除迷信和发扬共产主义的风格，广泛深入地开展群众性的技术革命运动，这是大大增加铁矿石产量的中心一环，我们必须好好抓住它。
    不仅在技术革命中，而且在矿山工作的其他各个方面也必须认真贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动，这是1959年产量再翻一番的根本保障。矿山企业活动的一切重要问题，如年度、季度和每月的生产计划和各项措施的确定，以及其他重大问题的解决，都必须发动群众参加。必须切实贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”，努力把广大群众的生产活动和生产管理紧密结合起来。不仅要动员和组织群众把生产搞好，而且还必须关心广大职工群众的物质生活和文化生活，切实作到劳逸结合。
    在矿山中大搞技术革命的群众运动，应当针对目前生产技术中的关键性的问题。在采矿方面，技术革命的主要对象是：以不增加设备为主的高效能的采矿方法；以现有技术装备为基础的高效能的凿岩爆破技术；提高采矿、选矿设备的利用率；改善矿内运输系统，提高矿内运输的装载能力；改善生产劳动组织，提高各工种的劳动生产率。在选矿方面，技术革命主要应以增加产量（精矿粉产量）和提高质量（含铁量）为中心，提高破碎、球磨和选矿机的作业率和生产能力，改善现有选矿流程，创造经济适用的浮选药剂，提高选矿的收回率，并研究突破氧化矿的选矿技术关。在机械化程度较低和体力劳动还占主要地位的矿山企业，技术革命还必须在减低劳动强度，改良和创造较高效能的采掘和运输工具设备方面，作出巨大的努力。
    在力争矿山企业产量再翻一番的运动中，我们还必须根据去年大跃进的经验，必须全面抓，使构成生产过程的各个环节一齐跃进。在大力提高采矿强度的同时，还必须按计划、按比例地抓紧完成剥离工程量（露天矿）和巷道切割工程量（井下矿），使采矿和采矿准备成比例地齐头并进。不仅要注意提高采掘、剥离工作量，同时还要注意提高矿内运输能力，加强装载和运输的组织工作和调度工作，使采掘、剥离量和运输量大致取得平衡。不仅要保证完成产品数量的计划，而且还要保证完成矿石和精选粉的质量指标。一方面要大力发挥现有设备的效能，提高设备利用率，另一方面还要加强维护和进行计划检修。在生产大跃进各个方面都比较紧张的情况下，要特别注意加强安全工作，切实做到“生产大跃进，安全有保证”。总之，在力争铁矿石产量再翻一番的大跃进中，我们必须使领导的注意力和生产技术的组织管理工作，尽可能兼顾到事物的各个方面，既不怕不平衡，又努力实现积极的平衡。
    在辉煌胜利的1958年，钢铁冶炼的生产能力大大地增长了。为满足钢铁生产跃进的需要，除加强建设新的矿山之外，在目前以及今后几年内，主要还是要依靠现有生产矿山，也就是说，现有矿山企业仍然是保证钢铁生产原料的主要来源。因此，现有矿山企业必须勇敢地担负起这个光荣而艰巨的任务，为保证一千八百万吨钢的原料供应而付出巨大的努力。当然，现有矿山为完成产量翻一番的任务，虽然不是没有困难，但是，只要我们在战略上藐视一切困难，在战术上重视困难，针对当前存在的问题，采取各种有效的措施，我们就可以克服困难。马克思曾说过：“这种克服困难作法，本身就是自由的实现”。今年在矿山生产大跃进中，必须继续认真地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，认真加强政治思想工作，必须继续鼓足干劲，反对保守，大大发扬依靠群众和自力更生克服困难的战斗精神。这是完成1959年产量翻一番任务的根本保证。在去年大跃进中，我们在这一方面取得了较多的经验，对此应加以总结，并在今年的大跃进中进一步的加以贯彻。
    我们相信，在1958年胜利的基础上我们一定会完成1959年的光荣的重大任务。让我们在党的总路线光辉照耀之下，为实现今年铁矿石产量再翻一番的更大跃进而奋斗。
