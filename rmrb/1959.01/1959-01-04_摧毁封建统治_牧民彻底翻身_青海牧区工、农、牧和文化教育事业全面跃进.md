Destroy feudal rule, liberate the herdsmen completely: Qinghai pastoral areas achieve an all-round leap forward in industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and cultural education

    (Our dispatch) Under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, more than 400,000 Tibetan and Mongolian people in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province vigorously promoted socialist revolution in 1958. In just a few months, the face of the pastoral areas underwent fundamental changes.

    Thanks to the arduous work carried out by the Party in the pastoral areas since liberation, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of laboring herdsmen has been unprecedentedly raised. Last year, in the socialist revolution, they simultaneously and thoroughly completed the tasks of the democratic revolution, destroyed the feudal ruling forces, abolished the feudal serf system of the herdowner class, thoroughly liberated the productive forces of the pastoral areas, and realized the people's commune system. At present, over 67% of the province's herdsmen have joined people's communes, including 100% of the herdsmen in the four autonomous prefectures of Hainan, Haibei, Haixi, and Huangnan.

    After communization, it became possible to rationally use and improve grasslands, which is conducive to the feeding, management, and breed improvement of livestock; disputes were reduced, the unity among herdsmen was strengthened, and the contradictions of herdsmen's dispersed operations that were not easy to coordinate were resolved. This created favorable conditions for settled grazing, the integration of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and the popularization of cultural education. As of mid-November 1958, more than 71% of the total number of herding households in pastoral areas had settled down, their living conditions have been greatly improved, and some herders have moved into houses; the old, weak, women, children, and sick no longer have to follow the herders year-round.

    In the integration of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry production, the past situation of only engaging in animal husbandry without industry and agriculture has been changed. According to incomplete statistics, in agricultural production last year, more than 1,200 canals were built, 1,210 reservoirs were built, springs were dug, and wells were drilled, irrigating 7 million mu of grassland; 124,641 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, and 61,152 mu were sown and yielded in 1958. In some areas, grain has basically become self-sufficient. In terms of livestock feeding management and grassland cultivation and protection, mass movements have been launched to build sheds and pens, prevent and control animal pests, and cut and store winter grass. More than 7,493 sheds and pens have been built in the pastoral areas of the province; more than 136 million jin of dry grass has been cut; more than 2.86 million animal pests have been eliminated; more than 2.1 million mu of locusts and caterpillar pests have been eliminated; more than 5.8 million head (pieces) of livestock have been treated for various epidemic diseases; and more than 225,000 Tibetan sheep have been improved. Thanks to the achievements of the above work, the survival rate of lambs last year was generally as high as 90% or more. In many areas, the lambing rate of sheep has seen the miracle of twins in one birth.

    The Heqia Township of Xinghai County experimented with improving grasslands, which increased pasture production by more than double. This township has also trained more than 160 folk veterinarians and 83 animal husbandry technicians, and has generally established a prevention and control network. In terms of industry, the laboring herdsmen have been searching for mineral deposits and establishing industries. According to incomplete statistics from the four autonomous prefectures of Haixi, Hainan, Haibei, and Huangnan, more than 3,000 factories and mines of various types have been established.

    The victory of the socialist revolution in the pastoral areas and the high-speed development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry production have promoted the cultural revolution. In just a few months, 55 new schools have been established, including secondary technical schools, ordinary middle schools, people's public schools, part-time work and part-time study, and spare-time animal husbandry and veterinary middle schools, and Red and Expert universities, with 9,440 herdsmen participating in the study. The original first-class middle schools and primary schools have also been greatly developed. The number of these two types of schools has increased from 231 in the previous year to 538, and the number of students has increased from 12,731 in the previous year to 37,823. In many places, illiteracy has been basically eliminated.

    After the socialist and communist awareness of the laboring herdsmen has been raised, they have consciously risen up to eliminate various superstitions, taboos, and outdated customs that are not conducive to the development of production and physical and mental health. For example, the superstitions and taboos of going out to tell fortunes and asking Buddha about farming in the past have been eliminated; the bad habit of not washing milk buckets and bowls for many years has been changed. Especially after settled grazing, the sanitary conditions on the grasslands have been greatly improved, and many places have bathing and hairdressing facilities, medical institutions, and they seek doctors instead of gods when they are sick. For example, in Heqia Township, paying attention to hygiene has become a custom. In addition to the commune canteen and their own yurts being cleaned regularly inside and outside, many people often wash their faces, brush their teeth, wash their clothes, and take baths. The herdsmen happily used folk songs to praise their current lives, saying: "The Communist Party's kindness is deep, eliminating feudalism and poverty, and the working people have turned over; work hard, engage in production, study culture, pay attention to hygiene, and create paradise in the world."

    摧毁封建统治  牧民彻底翻身
    青海牧区工、农、牧和文化教育事业全面跃进
    本报讯　青海省牧业区的四十多万藏、蒙族人民，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，1958年大干社会主义革命。在短短的几个月内，使牧业区的面貌发生了根本性的变化。
    由于解放后党在牧区进行了许多艰苦工作，广大劳动牧民的社会主义觉悟空前提高。去年在社会主义革命中同时彻底地完成了民主革命的任务，摧毁了封建统治势力，废除了牧主阶级的封建奴隶制度，彻底解放了牧区生产力，并且实现了人民公社化。现在，全省牧民参加人民公社的已达总户数的67％以上，其中海南、海北、海西和黄南四个自治州的牧民100％参加了人民公社。
    公社化后，可以合理地使用和改良草原利于牲畜的饲放管理和品种改良；减少了纠纷，增强了牧民间的团结，解决了牧民分散经营不易协作的矛盾。这就给定居放牧，工农牧业结合，普及文化教育创造了有利条件。截至1958年11月中旬，已有占牧区总户数71％以上的牧民定居下来，居住条件大大改善，部分牧民住上了房子；老弱妇孺和病人再也不要整年跟上放牧的人流动。
    在工农牧业生产的结合上，改变了过去只经营牧业，没有工业、农业的状况。据不完全的统计，去年在农业生产上，已修水渠一千二百多条，修水库、挖泉、打井等一千二百一十处，灌溉草原七百万亩；开垦荒地十二万四千六百四十一亩，1958年播种并有收益的六万一千一百五十二亩，个别地区粮食已基本达到自给。在牲畜的饲放管理和草原的培育保护方面，开展了群众性的修棚打圈、防治兽害、割储冬草运动。全省牧区已修好棚圈七千四百九十三个；割好干草一万三千六百多万斤；消灭兽害二百八十六万多头；消灭蝗虫及毛虫等虫害二百一十多万亩；医治牲畜各种疫病五百八十多万头（只）；改良藏系绵羊二十二万五千多只。由于上述工作的成绩，使去年羔羊成活率一般高达90％以上。有不少地区的羊只繁殖率出现了一胎双羔的奇迹。
    兴海县河卡乡试验改良草原，使牧草产量增加一倍以上。这个乡还培养了民间兽医一百六十多人，畜牧技术人员八十三人，普遍建立了防疫网。在工业方面，劳动牧民群众寻找矿点，创办工业。据海西、海南、海北和黄南四个自治州的不完全统计，已建立起各种厂矿三千多个。
    牧区社会主义革命的胜利，工农牧业生产高速度的发展，推进了文化革命。在短短几个月中，就新办起中等技术学校、普通中学、人民公学、半工半读和业余畜牧兽医中学、红专大学等学校五十五所，参加学习的牧民九千四百四十名。原有的第一类中学和小学也有了很大的发展，这两类学校由前年的二百三十一所发展到五百三十八所，学生由前年的一万二千七百三十一名，发展到三万七千八百二十三名。并有不少地方基本上扫除了文盲。
    劳动牧民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟提高以后，他们自觉地起来破除各种不利于生产发展及身心健康的迷信、禁忌、陈规陋习。例如过去出外算卦，种地问佛等迷信、禁忌都破除了；多年不洗牛奶桶和碗筷的陋习改掉了。特别是定居放牧之后，草原上的卫生条件大大改善，不少地方有了洗澡和理发的设备，有了医疗机构，有病不求神，而请医生了。如河卡乡牧民讲究卫生已经成为风尚，除公社食堂和各自帐房内外经常打扫得干净外，许多人已经常洗脸、刷牙、洗衣服和洗澡了。牧民们兴高彩烈地用民歌歌颂现在的生活说：“共产党恩情深，反封建除穷根，劳动人民翻了身；鼓干劲，闹生产学文化，讲卫生，把天堂创造在人间。”
