Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 24th: The German News Agency (DPA) published on the evening of January 24th a conversation between Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and United Press International reporter Mr. Fleming. Ulbricht discussed the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government, as well as the establishment of a confederation between the two German states and other related issues.

Ulbricht said that the draft peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union would restore the unity of divided Germany. According to the provisions of this treaty, conditions will be created in West Germany to eradicate militarism and prohibit nuclear armament, overcoming the decisive obstacles hindering reconciliation between the two Germanys. West Germany's withdrawal from NATO and the German Democratic Republic's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, as well as Germany enjoying full sovereignty (including the prohibition of other countries interfering in German affairs) - these will not only help restore national unity but will also make reunification possible. There can be no reunification as long as one part of Germany develops along a militaristic path.

Ulbricht reiterated the German Democratic Republic's proposal to establish a confederation between the two German states. He said that if the West German Federal Government is willing to accept the proposal he made in the People's Chamber to discuss the peace treaty issue with the government of the German Democratic Republic, it would be possible to discuss the issue of organizing a confederation in such discussions. He said, "We will naturally carefully consider the suggestions made by the Federal Government regarding the nature of the confederation."

Ulbricht added that the confederation would be composed of a certain number of members from the two German parliaments on an equal basis. The fact that the Federal Republic has 50 million people, while the German Democratic Republic has 18 million people, should not affect the equal basis of the confederation of the two German states.

Ulbricht pointed out that both German states should become members of the United Nations. However, once the German Confederation is formed, this confederation, composed of representatives from the two German states on an equal basis, should be admitted as a member of the United Nations until it is replaced by a unified Germany.

The reporter asked: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference in Washington on January 13th that the neutralization of Germany proposed in the Soviet draft treaty was unacceptable. He suggested, as an alternative, that the West guarantee that eastern Germany would not become a Western military base. Can the German Democratic Republic accept such a proposal?

Ulbricht replied: This kind of "proposal" is completely unacceptable to the German Democratic Republic. We will never accept such a proposal. Mr. Dulles should remember that Germany is not a pie that anyone can poke with a fork. Mr. Dulles' claim that West Germany should remain militarized while the German Democratic Republic should be neutralized is simply not to be taken seriously. Dulles' talk of being willing to offer a Western guarantee, but as long as militarists rule West Germany, such guarantees are not worth a penny. Germany must cease to be a threat to the United States, Britain, France, and other Western neighbors, just as it must cease to be a threat to the Soviet Union and Germany's other Eastern neighbors.

Referring to West German Chancellor Adenauer's statement that Germany can only be reunified through free elections, Ulbricht pointed out that Adenauer's proposal is nothing more than a smokescreen for West German militarists' plans to conquer the German Democratic Republic by force.

Ulbricht said that elections are not held at the beginning of the reunification process, they are the grand finale. "Under the current conditions in West Germany, all-German elections can only allow militaristic and war forces to seize power in Germany. For the sake of the interests of our German people and the interests of the people of other countries, we must never tolerate this situation."

Reunifying Germany under the rule of West German militarists would mean a third world war.

Ulbricht said that after the Soviet Union transfers all its control functions to the German Democratic Republic at the end of May, representatives of Western countries will hold meetings with representatives of the German Democratic Republic government to consider and pass practical measures regarding the use of traffic routes belonging to the German Democratic Republic to West Berlin. The sooner the meeting takes place, the better to avoid difficulties.

Ulbricht said: "Naturally, the most reasonable thing would be for Western countries applying to use the territory and airspace of the German Democratic Republic to diplomatically recognize the German Democratic Republic. But we will not insist on diplomatic recognition of the German Democratic Republic; in this regard, we are patient and indifferent. The main issue is that everyone understands that without respecting the German Democratic Republic and holding negotiations with the representatives of this country, it is impossible to demand anything from the German Democratic Republic or obtain anything from it. However, if the Western countries act correctly, we will also deal with the Western countries correctly."

The reporter also asked: If negotiations are held with the German Democratic Republic, will the German Democratic Republic grant Western countries the same rights they currently enjoy in entering West Berlin?

Ulbricht said: As long as the Western countries approach this issue with the correct attitude and according to international law, it is possible to reach an understanding on anything.

Ulbricht pointed out that if no agreement is reached by May 30th, the issue of making West Berlin a demilitarized free city will remain on the political agenda until the issue is resolved. He emphasized that this issue will eventually be resolved because it is ultimately absolutely intolerable to maintain a center of war in West Berlin. However, what will definitely happen on May 30th is: the transfer of rights currently exercised by the Soviet Union under the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin to the relevant authorities of the German Democratic Republic.

### 乌布利希对美国记者发表谈话  苏联和约草案将使德国恢复统一  希望西德接受建议商谈组织邦联问题

    乌布利希对美国记者发表谈话
    苏联和约草案将使德国恢复统一
    希望西德接受建议商谈组织邦联问题
    新华社柏林24日电　德意志通讯社24日晚间发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希对合众国际社记者弗莱明发表的谈话。乌布利希谈到了苏联政府提出的对德和约草案，以及建立两个德国的邦联和其他有关问题。
    乌布利希说，苏联所提出的和约草案将使分裂的德国恢复统一。按照这个条约的规定，将在西德创造这样一些条件：根除军国主义和禁止原子武装，克服妨害两个德国和解的决定性障碍。西德退出北大西洋公约组织和德意志民主共和国退出华沙条约，以及使德国享有完整的主权（包括禁止其他国家干涉德国事务）——这些不仅将有助于恢复国家的统一，并且将使恢复统一成为可能。只要德国的一部分沿着军国主义的道路发展就不可能有重新统一。
    乌布利希追述了德意志民主共和国关于建立两个德国的邦联的建议。他说，如果西德联邦政府愿意接受他在人民议院中所提出的建议来同德意志民主共和国政府商谈和约问题，那就有可能在这样的商谈中商量组织邦联的问题。他说：“我们自然会很仔细地考虑联邦政府就邦联的性质所提出的建议。”
    乌布利希又说，邦联将由两个德国议会的一定数目的议员在对等的基础上组成。联邦共和国拥有五千万人口，而德意志民主共和国拥有一千八百万人口，这个事实不能影响两个德国的邦联的对等基础。
    乌布利希指出，两个德国都应当成为联合国的会员国。但是一旦德意志邦联组成以后，这个由两个德国的代表在对等基础上构成的邦联应当被接纳为联合国的一个会员国，直到这个邦联为一个统一的德国所代替时为止。
    记者问道：美国国务卿杜勒斯1月13日曾经在华盛顿的一次记者招待会上说，苏联和约草案中所建议的德国中立化是不能接受的。他建议作为代替的是由西方保证使德国东部不成为西方的军事基地。德意志民主共和国能够接受这样一个建议吗？
    乌布利希回答说：这种“建议”对德意志民主共和国来说，是完全不能接受的。我们决不会接受这种建议。杜勒斯先生应当记着，德国不是任何人都可以用叉子乱戳的馅饼。杜勒斯先生的关于西德应当仍旧军国主义化而德意志民主共和国则中立化的主张，是根本不能认真看待的。杜勒斯谈到愿意提供一项西方的保证，但是只要军国主义者统治西德，这种保证是一钱不值的。德国必须停止成为对美国、英国与法国和对其他西方邻国的威胁，正像它必须停止成为对苏联和德国的其他东方邻国的威胁一样。
    谈到西德总理阿登纳所谓只有通过自由选举德国才能重新统一的问题时，乌布利希指出，阿登纳的这个建议不是别的，而是西德军国主义者打算用武力来征服德意志民主共和国的烟幕。
    乌布利希说，选举并不是在重新统一的过程的开始时举行的，它是压轴戏。“在西德目前的条件下，全德选举只能使军国主义和战争势力在德国掌握政权。为了我们德国人民的利益以及其他国家人民的利益，我们决不能容忍这种情况。”
    重新统一德国而由西德军国主义者统治，将意味着第三次世界大战。
    乌布利希说，在苏联在5月底把一切管制职权移交给德意志民主共和国以后，西方国家的代表将同德意志民主共和国政府的代表举行会议，来考虑和通过关于使用属于德意志民主共和国的到西柏林的交通线的实际措施。会议越早开，就越能更好地避免困难。
    乌布利希说：“自然最合理的事是申请使用德意志民主共和国领土和领空的西方国家在外交上承认德意志民主共和国。但是我们不会坚持要求在外交上承认德意志民主共和国，在这方面我们是有耐心的，而且是不在乎的。主要的问题是，大家都了解，不尊重德意志民主共和国，不同这个国家的代表举行谈判，那就不可能向德意志民主共和国要求任何东西，或从它那儿得到任何东西。但是，如果西方国家方面做得正确，我们这方面也将正确地同西方国家打交道。”
    记者又问：如果同德意志民主共和国举行谈判，在进入西柏林问题上，德意志民主共和国是否会给予西方国家目前所享有的同样的权利？
    乌布利希说：只要西方国家方面以正确的态度、并根据国际法来对待这个问题，在任何事情上取得谅解都是可能的。
    乌布利希指出，如果到5月30日还没有就安排达成协议，那么，使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的问题将继续留在政治议程上，直到这个问题获得解决时为止。他强调说，这个问题终要解决的，因为要在西柏林保持一个战争中心，终究是绝对不能容忍的。但是，在5月30日肯定要发生的事情是：把苏联目前根据四国关于柏林的协议所行使的权利移交给德意志民主共和国的有关当局。
