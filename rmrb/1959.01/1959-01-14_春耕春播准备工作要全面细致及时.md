Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th: Fujian Province has made rapid progress in winter plowing in the past month, with ten million mu of land deeply plowed, most of which has been plowed more than one foot deep.

Since Fujian Province basically completed the autumn harvest work in early December last year, more than 1.8 million laborers have been投入into deep plowing. In order to speed up the progress of deep plowing, various places have also vigorously reformed farming tools and manufactured some rope traction machines and other tools suitable for mountainous farming. The rope traction machine manufactured in Minqing County can deeply plow about 1.5 mu of terraced fields per day, which is ten times more efficient than manual digging. Dahu Commune in Minhou Mountain area enlarged the wheel axle of the rope traction machine and installed ball bearings on the pulley shaft, making it light and fast. It can plow six mu of land a day by pulling a deep-耕犁 plow.

While deeply plowing the fields, various localities also carried out work such as layered fertilization, pest control, soil improvement, land leveling, and adjustment of irrigation systems. Two million mu of land throughout the province have been fertilized in layers during deep plowing, with an average of about 400 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. The耕地 cultivated land of Tuorong Commune in Fu'an County was originally mostly small hill-ridge fields. This time, in combination with soil and water conservation work, the small hills were merged into large hills, which greatly facilitated cultivation. Hongyan Commune in Shaowu County, in conjunction with deep plowing, planned irrigation canals piece by piece and hill by hill. In addition to completing 15,000 mu of deeply plowed land, it also dug 488 irrigation canals. Shanghai Chengxiang Commune Actively Strengthens Farm Implement Management

Xinhua News Agency: The Fourth Management District of Chengxiang People's Commune in Qingpu County, Shanghai, in order to prepare for the upcoming spring plowing and major production, actively strengthened the management of farm implements and ensured that every item was managed by someone and every item had a warehouse.

This management district recently launched a venting and debate among the vast number of commune members on the issue of farm implement management, and then organized forces to clean up the farm implements in the entire management district, adopting a "six-fix" system of "fixing people, fixing items, fixing repairs, fixing rewards, fixing responsibilities, and fixing warehouses."

After communization, some cadres in this management district believed that "electric irrigation and mechanized cultivation will be implemented soon, and old farm implements will not be needed," and ideologically relaxed the management of farm implements. In response to this situation, the Party branch of the management district convened a meeting of cadres and absorbed some old farmers to specifically review the management of farm implements. On this basis, they carefully studied the "six-fix" management method and established a "Farm Implement Property Inventory Team." After the meeting, each production team immediately organized forces to take inventory of farm implements item by item, numbering them, registering them, and "returning them home." Now, more than 2,000 farm implements, large and small, in this management district, except for those in use, have been inventoried, collected, and "returned home." After washing and drying, they have been placed in warehouses, achieving "no omissions and no losses."

In order to make every commune member establish a sense of ownership of cherishing public property and loving the commune as their home, each production team widely organized venting and debate among the commune members on "how to use and manage public property well." Through this venting and debate, the commune members realized the importance of managing public property well. Thus, a management system was determined for what farm implements should be kept by whom, where they should be placed, and how they should be repaired; it was stipulated that "two nos" and "one good" should be achieved, that is, no loss, no damage, and good safekeeping. Because the commune members realized that to extend the life of farm implements, it is not only important to keep them well, but also to use them well, the commune members automatically established a system for "receiving and returning" farm implements and for "using them carefully and returning them to the warehouse in a timely manner."
Guangdong Chunwan Commune Inspects and Identifies Early Rice Improved Varieties

Southern Daily News: Chunwan People's Commune in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, in order to prepare for spring planting in a timely manner, recently organized a grain seed inspection team to go to various management districts to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection and identification of the preparation of early rice improved varieties this year; and mobilized the masses to offer suggestions to solve the difficulties of insufficient improved varieties.

During the inspection, it was found that many cadres and commune members did not pay enough attention to the selection of improved varieties. Not only did they not reserve enough improved varieties for this year's early rice according to the plan, but they also did not take good care of the existing improved varieties. The entire commune is still short of 1.2 million jin of improved varieties.

In order to ensure a greater harvest of early rice this year, the commune leaders immediately convened mass meetings and various symposiums to explain to the masses the benefits of selecting improved varieties through venting, and at the same time mobilized the masses to inspect and identify existing improved varieties. The masses were very enthusiastic and identified more than 4,000 jin of Siam improved varieties within two days, and 34 dining halls also identified 9,183 jin of Siam and other improved varieties. After inspection and identification, the improved varieties of the entire commune increased by about 60,000 jin compared to before the inspection.
Shandong Dabu Commune Launches Spring Land Winter Irrigation Campaign

Dazhong Daily News: Dabu Management District of Dabu People's Commune in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, actively launched spring plowing and spring planting preparation work, and actively launched a spring land winter irrigation campaign. As of January 7, 1,250 mu of land had been leveled and 434 mu had been winter irrigated.

In the past, Dabu Management District did not have the habit of winter irrigation. Last year, only more than 600 mu of spring land was winter irrigated. Therefore, when winter irrigation was organized this year, some commune members believed that the land was wet and did not need winter irrigation; others believed that there were many farm work such as wheat field management, deep plowing, and river excavation, and there was a shortage of labor. It would not be too late to irrigate after the beginning of spring. In light of this situation, the Party branch launched a venting and debate among the commune members. During the debate, everyone used the specific examples of increased production from winter irrigation in this management district to explain the benefits of winter irrigation. After venting and debate, everyone realized that the benefits of winter irrigation on spring land are:

1.  It can prevent drought and conserve moisture, and protect seeds and ensure emergence;
2.  The land is wet and there are fewer clods, which saves labor in land preparation;
3.  Combined with winter irrigation, the land can be prepared in advance, striving for the initiative in spring planting.

While carrying out ideological mobilization, the branch also first organized commune members in the fourth team, which had achieved increased production from winter irrigation last year, to carry out winter irrigation, first setting an example, and then organizing cadres above the team leader level to visit the site. Then, it proposed the task of winter irrigating 2,800 mu of land in the entire management district before the Spring Festival. Each production team also formulated winter irrigation plans and established a 450-person winter irrigation professional team, democratically formulating labor quotas. Competitions for winter irrigation of spring land were also launched between teams and between professional groups. The management district established an evaluation and inspection team to promptly check the implementation of the winter irrigation plans of each team and group, and quickly promoted winter irrigation activities.
Shaanxi Yuanhua County Ensures Livestock Overwintering

Shaanxi Daily News: Yuanhua County, Shaanxi Province, seized an important link in the preparatory work for spring plowing, and recently organized a 10,000-person inspection team to go deep into the rural areas to carefully inspect the work of ensuring the safe overwintering of livestock.

Before the inspection, some phenomena of not paying attention to draft cattle appeared in the local rural areas. Some commune cadres emphasized that they were busy with work and relaxed the education of breeders and the leadership of breeding management work. As a result, livestock loss and death occurred in some places.

The inspection team mobilized the masses to vent and debate, reversed and criticized some one-sided and erroneous ideas on livestock issues, and in conjunction with the inspection work, helped each commune formulate a responsibility system for loving and protecting livestock and ensuring safe overwintering with "layer-by-layer contracts and contracts to the end." In order to ensure that every head of livestock is strong, grows well, and has good fat color, it is also stipulated that regular inspections and evaluations should be carried out, the good should be commended, the bad should be criticized, and a competition for raising livestock with red flags should be launched.

After the inspection and the establishment of the system, the county prepared for the safe overwintering of more than 28,000 livestock. According to incomplete statistics, 621 of the county's 800+ breeding rooms have already made preparations for overwintering; the remaining 100+ breeding rooms are also making preparations for overwintering.

    春耕春播准备工作要全面细致及时
    福建深翻土地和调整灌溉系统
    据新华社福州13日电　福建省各地最近一个月来冬耕工作进展很快，已深翻田地一千万亩，其中大部分深翻一尺以上。
    福建省去年12月初基本结束秋收工作后，就有一百八十多万劳动力投入了深翻土工作。为了加快深翻土的进度，各地还大力改革耕作工具，制造了一些适合山区耕作的绳索牵引机和其他工具，闽清县制造的绳索牵引机，每天能深翻梯田一亩半左右，比人工挖土效率提高十倍。闽侯山区大湖公社把绳索牵引机的轮轴放大，又在滑轮转轴上安上滚珠，因此既轻又快，牵引一部深耕犁一天可以犁田六亩。
    在深翻田地的同时，各地还结合进行了分层施肥、扑灭虫害、改良土壤、平整土地，调整灌溉系统等工作。全省有二百万亩田地在深翻中分层施了肥，平均每亩施肥四百担左右。福安县拓荣公社的耕地原来绝大部分是山垅小丘田，这次结合进行水土保持工作，把小丘并成大丘，大大便利了耕作。邵武县红沿公社结合深翻土逐片逐丘地规划灌溉渠道，除完成一万五千亩深翻地外，还挖了灌溉渠道四百八十八条。上海城厢公社积极加强农具管理
    据新华社讯　上海市青浦县城厢人民公社第四管理区为了给即将到来的春耕大生产作好准备，积极加强农具管理，做到了件件有人管，物物有库房。
    这个管理区最近就农具管理问题，发动广大社员开展了一次鸣放辩论，接着又组织力量，清理了全管理区的农具，采取“定人、定件、定修理、定奖励、定责任、定库房”的“六定”制度。
    公社化以后，这个管理区部分干部认为“很快就要实行电力灌溉、机械化耕作了，旧农具用不到了”，思想上放松了对农具的管理。针对这种情况，管理区党支部召集了干部、并吸收了部分老农民、专门开了会，检查了农具管理情况，在此基础上，认真研究了“六定”管理办法，成立了“农具财产清理小组”。会后，各生产队立即组织了力量，采取边清点、边编号、边登记、边“归家”的办法，对农具进行逐件清理。现在，这个管理区二千多件大小农具除了正在使用的以外，已全部检点收集“归了家”，经过洗刷曝晒，放进了库房，做到了“一件不漏，一物不丢”。
    为了使每个社员都树立起爱护公共财产、爱社如家的主人翁态度，各生产队都在社员群众中广泛组织了“怎样使用、管好公共财产”的鸣放辩论。通过这次鸣放辩论，使社员们认识到管理好公共财产的重要意义。从而确定了什么农具什么人保管、放在什么地方、怎样修理的保管制度等；规定要做到“二不”“一好”，即不丢失、不损坏，保管好。由于社员们认识到要延长农具寿命，不仅要保管好，更重要的是要使用好，因此，社员们自动地定了“领、还”和“小心使用、及时归库”的使用农具制度。
    广东春湾公社检查鉴定早稻良种
    据南方日报消息　广东省两阳县春湾人民公社为了及时做好春播准备工作，最近组织了一支粮食种子检查队伍，分赴各个管理区，对今年早稻良种的准备情况进行全面的深入的检查和鉴别；并发动群众献计，解决良种不足的困难。
    在检查中，发现许多干部和社员对选用良种不够重视，不但没有按计划留足今年早稻用的良种，而且对已有的良种也没有保管好。全公社尚缺一百二十万斤良种。
    公社领导为了保证今年早稻更大丰收，立即召开群众大会和各种座谈会，通过鸣放向群众讲清选用良种的好处，同时发动群众检查鉴定现有良种。群众积极性很高，两天内便查出暹罗良种四千多斤，三十四个饭堂也查出暹罗等良种九千一百八十三斤。经过检查鉴定，全公社的良种比检查前增加了六万斤左右。
    山东大布公社掀起春地冬灌运动
    据大众日报消息　山东省寿张县大布人民公社大布管理区积极展开春耕春播准备工作，主动掀起了春地冬灌运动。到1月7日，已平整土地一千二百五十亩，冬灌四百三十四亩。
    大布管理区过去没有冬灌的习惯，去年只冬灌春地六百多亩。因此，今年开始组织冬灌时，有些社员认为地湿不需要冬灌；也有的认为目前麦田管理、深翻地、挖河等农活忙，劳力少，开春后再灌也晚不了。根据这种情况，党支部发动社员展开了鸣放辩论。在辩论中，大家以本管理区冬灌增产的具体事例，说明了冬灌的好处。经过鸣放辩论，大家认识到春地冬灌的好处是：
    一、可以防旱保墒、保种保出；
    二、地湿坷垃少，整地省工；
    三、结合冬灌，可以提前把地整好，争取春播主动。
    在进行思想发动的同时，支部还在去年冬灌获得增产的第四队首先组织社员进行冬灌，先做出样子，然后组织组长以上干部实地参观。接着，提出了春节前全管理区冬灌二千八百亩的任务。各生产队也都订出了冬灌计划，并建立了四百五十人的冬灌专业队，民主制订出劳动定额。并在队与队，专业组与专业组之间，展开冬灌春地的竞赛。管理区建立了评比检查小组，及时检查各队、组冬灌计划的执行情况，迅速推开了冬灌活动。
    陕西原华县确保牲畜过冬
    据陕西日报消息　陕西省原华县抓紧备耕工作中的重要一环，最近组织了万人检查团，深入农村细致地检查牲畜安全过冬工作。
    检查以前，当地农村中出现了一些不重视耕畜的现象。有些社干部强调工作忙，也放松了对饲养员的教育和对饲养管理工作的领导。使有些地方发生了牲畜落膘和死亡现象。
    检查团发动群众鸣放辩论，扭转和批判了牲畜问题上的一些片面和错误的想法，并结合检查工作，帮助各公社制订了“层层包、包到底”的爱畜保畜、安全过冬的责任制。为了确保头头牲畜体强力壮，长得好，膘色好，还规定按期检查、评比，对于好的表扬，坏的批评，并开展插红旗的饲养牲畜竞赛运动。
    经过检查和制度的建立，全县为两万八千多头牲畜安全过冬作好了准备。据不完全统计，全县八百多个饲养室，目前已做好过冬准备工作的就有六百二十一个；所余一百多个饲养室也正在做着过冬准备工作。（附图片）
