Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 1st: The first batch of twenty-two "Qianjin" (Forward) brand diesel trucks manufactured by the Shanxi Auto Factory began participating in transportation work in Taiyuan City at the end of 1958.

The "Qianjin" brand diesel truck has a speed of seventy to eighty kilometers per hour, a load capacity of four tons, runs smoothly, has light steering operation, and low fuel consumption, using only 14.4 liters per hundred kilometers. Because of the addition of a low-speed gear in the gearbox, this type of car is not only suitable for driving on city roads, but also very suitable for use in mountainous areas.

The Shanxi Auto Factory was just an auto repair shop a month ago, with rudimentary technical equipment and conditions, only able to repair and fabricate some auto parts. After repeated research at the end of September last year, the factory's employees successfully trial-produced three diesel vehicles, which further liberated their thinking and determined to transform the factory into an automobile manufacturing plant. In order to overcome the difficulties of lacking large-scale professional processing equipment and insufficient technical strength, the employees brought into play collective wisdom and created and improved more than two hundred kinds of machines and tools. From the engine to the transmission mechanism, braking device, steering system, and body exterior, all important components were manufactured by them one by one, and the quality of each component met the requirements.

    山西汽车厂突破制造难关
    首批柴油载重汽车参加运输
    据新华社太原1日电　山西汽车制造厂制造的首批“前进”牌柴油载重汽车二十二辆，1958年底已开始参加太原市的运输工作。
    “前进”牌柴油载重汽车时速是七十——八十公里，载重能力四吨，行驶平稳，转向操纵轻巧，耗油量低，每百公里只用十四点四公升。由于增加了变速箱的低速装置，这种汽车除了适合在城市公路上行驶以外，也很适于在山区使用。
    山西汽车制造厂在一个月以前还是一个汽车修配厂，技术设备条件简陋，只能修理和配制一些汽车零件。工厂的职工在去年9月底经过反复研究，试制成功三辆柴油汽车，这使他们进一步解放了思想，决心把工厂改变成为汽车制造厂。职工们为了克服缺乏大型专业加工设备和技术力量不足的困难，发挥集体智慧，创造和改进了二百多种机器和工具。从发动机到传动机构、制动装置、转向系统和车身外型等全部重要机件，他们都一一制造出来了，并且各个部件的质量都合乎要求。
