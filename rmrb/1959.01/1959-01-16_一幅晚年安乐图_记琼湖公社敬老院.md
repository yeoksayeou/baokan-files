A Picture of Peaceful and Happy Old Age
    ——A Record of the Qionghu Commune's Home for the Aged
    Lu Jiang
    North of Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, on the shores of Dongting Lake, nestled among groves of orange trees, stands a beautiful building: the Qionghu Commune's Home for the Aged.

    The surroundings of this home are picturesque and exceptionally tranquil. The tall building stands on a small hillside, surrounded on three sides by the lake, with a vegetable garden in front, a gently flowing stream, shady orange groves, and fragrant flowers. Some of the elderly people of the Qionghu Commune live here.

    Stepping into the Home for the Aged, one sees a row of elderly women with graying hair sitting under the eaves of the north house. In the warm sunshine, some are slicing and drying sweet potatoes, some are chatting about family matters, some are reading the newspaper, and several are resting with their eyes closed.

    The female director, Wen Chunxiu, hearing that guests had arrived, quickly came out from inside, offering cigarettes and tea while introducing us: "The dining hall is on the west side, the men's and women's dormitories are on both sides, and the clubhouse in the middle serves as a living room and a place for the elderly to rest. The dormitories are separated for men and women, with four elderly people sharing a room. Yang Wangsen and Guo Youxiu, Xie Guihua and Jiang Xiuying are two elderly couples, each living in a single room. The old ladies Xie Faxiu and Nie Hexiu get along very well and wanted to live together, so the home arranged for them to share a dormitory."

    The director and the elderly people took us to the clubhouse, which was spotlessly clean. Vases were filled with fresh flowers, the tables were covered with many books, magazines, and entertainment items, as well as fresh oranges sent by the commune. A row of lounge chairs lined the wall, and an old man was resting on one. Entering the elderly people's dormitories, each had a ceiling and floor, the beds were hung with new mosquito nets, covered with thick rice straw, and the mattresses were covered with new floral bedsheets. Each bed was neatly folded with a quilt, and each dormitory had a tea set. These items were all provided by the commune. The elderly people also brought their favorite chests, utensils, mirrors, dressing tables, stoves, and other items from home, lacking nothing for their daily needs. The faint winter sunlight shone through the clear glass windows, making the room particularly bright and comfortable.

    The elderly guided us to the dining hall, where a couplet written by the elderly themselves was pasted on the wall:
    "Thinking of the past, getting up early and going to bed late, exposed to the sun and rain, ending up with little to eat and wear, sighing and complaining, blaming oneself for having a hard fate;
    Looking at today, having ample food and clothing, enjoying longevity and health, worry-free every day, happy and delighted, grateful for the wisdom of the Party."

    The table arrangements in the dining hall were made entirely according to the elderly people's wishes. Couples and those who usually got along well were seated together, and those who were sick ate separately. When it was time for lunch, the elderly people supported each other as they entered the dining hall. The staff delivered food to the hands of the disabled and blind elderly, and helped them refill their bowls after they finished. The elderly people at the same table constantly put vegetables into their bowls, and warm braziers were placed in the middle of the table to keep the dishes hot. The elderly people ate and laughed.

    The elderly praised the fact that they didn't have to worry about meals here, that they ate well, and that they ate warmly, which was a hundred times better than living alone at home.

    These twenty-two elderly people were originally the "Five Guarantees" households of the agricultural cooperative. The oldest was ninety years old, and the youngest was sixty-four years old. Seventeen of them had begged for food, and five had worked as long-term laborers. The ninety-year-old Xie Faxiu had the most tragic experience. She told us that she had given birth to six children, but five did not survive. The remaining son was killed by the Japanese devils. Her husband died at the age of forty, leaving her alone, wandering and begging for food with a stick. The seventy-year-old Li Qiuren started herding cattle for others at the age of seven. She had been married twice, but because of poverty, her first wife died of illness, and her second wife ran away, leaving him to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord for more than thirty years, living a lonely life.

    Speaking of the past, the elderly people had endless grievances to pour out!

    However, when they mentioned today, these gray-haired elderly people couldn't help but feel overjoyed and suddenly enlightened. The old man Yang Wangsen, sitting beside me, said: "Both my wife and I have worked as long-term laborers and begged for food for many years. We are old and unable to work, and we don't have any children. In the old society, we were exposed to the wind and rain all year round, with nothing to eat or wear. We thought that we would inevitably die in a ditch or on the road. Now it's great! We both entered the Home for the Aged, and our lives are warm and lively. There are many people, so we are not lonely. Chairman Mao has arranged things so well for us!" The ninety-year-old woman Nie Hexiu, because she had no children, always complained about her bitter fate in the past. Whenever she had pain, she would complain about why she didn't die sooner. At this time, she said: "Don't say I don't want to die. Even if I live to be over a hundred years old, I still won't think I'm too old!"

    The elderly people here enjoy a life of leisure. However, their hands, which have been working for many years, are always restless. Wen Chunxiu, the director of the Home for the Aged, told us that on the day they entered the home, she made it clear to the elderly that the purpose of coming here was to enjoy their old age and that they would not be given any production tasks. However, from the first day they entered the home, the elderly refused to be idle and always found some light work to do every day. We saw several elderly people who were weaving bamboo baskets, which were very fine and beautiful. In the breeding room, we saw an old woman enthusiastically helping the staff feed the pigs. Xie Guihua, an elderly man over seventy years old, had more than forty years of experience in growing vegetables. When he entered the home, he brought his hoe, harrow, and bamboo basket. As soon as he entered the home, he invited Yang Wangsen to take over the two acres of vegetable garden in front of the door to grow vegetables. Now the vegetables in the garden are growing plump and tender. The ninety-year-old women Nie Hexiu and Xie Faxiu have been good at needlework since they were young. After entering the home, they took out their needles and threads, which had been hidden for many years, and the two often sat by the stove embroidering flowers for relaxation. The elderly people's engagement in these small amounts of labor added a lot of vitality to their lives. Their labor was no longer for making a living, but for regulating their lives and improving their health.

    In the evening, we bid farewell to the elderly. We deeply wished these elderly people a happy old age.

    一幅晚年安乐图
    ——记琼湖公社敬老院
    鲁江
    湖南沅江县城北，洞庭湖畔，橘林丛中，有一座漂亮的房屋，这就是琼湖公社的敬老院。
    这敬老院四周，风景如画，异常幽静。高大的房屋矗立在小山坡上，三面环湖，前有菜园，溪水缓流，橘林成荫，花气袭人。琼湖公社的一些老人家，就生活在这里。
    跨进敬老院，看到北屋廊沿下，坐着一排头发斑白的老太太。在暖烘烘的阳光下，有的老人在切晒红苕干，有些在谈家常，有的在看报，好几位老人闭着眼睛在养神。
    女院长文春秀听说来了客人，连忙从屋内出来，一面招待烟茶，一面给我们介绍：“西边是膳厅，两边是男寝室、女寝室，中间俱乐部是客厅也是老人的休息室。寝室男女分住，每四位老人住一间。杨望森、郭有秀，谢贵华、姜秀英是两对老年夫妇，各住一个单房间。老太太谢发秀、聂和秀平时很合得来，希望住在一起，院里就把她们安排在一间寝室里。”
    院长和老人们带我们来到俱乐部，这里到处打扫得干干净净，瓶里插着鲜花，桌上摆着许多图书、画报、娱乐品，还有社里送来的鲜橘，墙边放着一排躺椅，有个老人正躺在椅上休息。走进老人的寝室，每间都有天花板和地板，床上挂着新蚊帐，铺着厚厚的稻草，垫絮上铺着新的花床单，一床床的棉被折得整整齐齐，每间寝室都有一套茶具，这些东西都是公社发给的。老人们从家里把自己喜爱的箱柜、用具也带来了，还有镜子、梳妆台、烤火炉等等，日常用的样样不缺。冬天淡淡的阳光，照射在明净的大玻璃窗上，屋内显得格外亮堂、舒适。
    老人引我们来到食堂，墙上贴着一副老人自作的对联：
    “想从前，起早睡晚，日晒雨淋，到头来少吃少穿，唉声叹气，埋怨自己命苦；
    看今天，丰衣足食，益寿延年，每日里无忧无虑，欢天喜地，感谢党的英明。”
    食堂里编的桌次，完全按照老人的意见，夫妇俩口，平时合得来的都编在一起，有病的隔着吃。吃中午饭了，老人们相互搀扶着走进食堂，身体残废和眼睛看不见的老人，由服务员把饭送到他们的手里，吃完又帮助添饭，同桌的老人也把菜不断地夹到他们的碗里，暖钵炉放在桌子中间，把菜炖的热烘烘的，老人们边吃饭边说笑。
    老人们见人就称赞这里吃饭不操心，吃得好，吃得暖，比在自己家里单独过日子强过百倍。
    这里的二十二位老人，原来都是农业社的“五保户”，年纪最大的九十岁，最小的六十四岁，其中十七人讨过饭，五人当过长工。九十岁的老人谢发秀，她的遭遇最悲惨。她告诉我们：她生过六个儿女，五个没有救住，剩下一个儿子被日本鬼子打死了；四十岁死去了老伴，从此孤零零一个人，抱着一根棍，讨饭流浪漂泊。七十岁的老人李求仁，七岁开始给人看牛，结过两次婚，因为贫穷，前妻病死了，后妻跟人走了，剩下他一个人给地主扛了三十多年长工，过着孤单的日子。
    提起往事，老人们一肚子的苦水吐不尽呵！
    可是，一提到今天，这些白发苍苍的老人，禁不住内心的喜悦，忽然开朗起来。坐在我身边的老人杨望森说：“我们老俩口都是做过多年长工讨过饭的人，年老不能劳动，又没有半个儿女，在旧社会一年到头风打头，雨打脸，吃没有吃的，穿没有穿的，想后来必定是沟死沟埋，路死路埋。现在可好啦！我们双双进了敬老院，生活过得热热的，人多又不寂寞，毛主席把我们安置得多好呀！”九十岁的老人聂和秀，因为无儿无女，从前总是经常悲怨命苦，一有病痛，就埋怨自己为什么不早些死，这时候她说：“莫说自己不想死，就是活上一百多岁也还不嫌自己老啦！”
    老人们在这里享受着清福，可是，长年劳动的双手总是闲不住。敬老院文春秀院长告诉我们，在进院的那天就给老人讲清楚了，到这里的目的是好好地养老，不给任何生产任务。但是老人从进院的第一天起就不肯闲着，每天总要找一些轻活干。我们看见好几位老人，他们正在编竹篮，编的很是细匀好看。到饲养室，看到一位老大娘在热情地帮助服务员喂猪。已逾古稀的老人谢贵华，有四十多年的种菜经验，他进院时，将自己的锄头、爬锄、箩箕都带来了，一进院，就邀着杨望森把门前两亩菜园要来种，如今园里的青菜长得又肥又嫩。九十岁的老大娘聂和秀、谢发秀，从小会做一手好针线，进院后，把藏起多年的针线又拿出来，两人常坐在炉边绣花消遣。老人们从事这些微量的劳动，给自己生活上添了不少活力。他们劳动已经不是为了谋生，而是为了调剂生活，增进身体健康。
    傍晚，我们告别了老人。我们为这些老人们的幸福晚年深深祝福。
