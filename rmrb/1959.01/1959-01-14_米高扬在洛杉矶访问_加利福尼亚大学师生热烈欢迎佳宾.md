Xinhua News Agency, January 13th. From TASS Los Angeles, January 12th: Mikoyan arrived in Los Angeles on the 11th.

　　Upon arrival, he held a press conference at the "Ambassador" Hotel, conveying the greetings and best wishes of the Soviet people to the citizens of Los Angeles through reporters, and answered many questions.

　　One reporter asked: Is the Soviet Union willing to share the scientific materials obtained from launching cosmic rockets with other countries? Mikoyan replied that the launch of cosmic rockets was originally part of the International Geophysical Year program, and Soviet scientists participating in the implementation of this program are exchanging the results of their research with scientists from other countries. He said that many materials obtained from launching rockets and artificial satellites have been published in newspapers. Mikoyan also spoke about the particularly warm hospitality he received from representatives of the press and business circles in San Francisco.

　　In the evening, Mikoyan attended a banquet held in his honor by Johnston, President of the Motion Picture Association of America.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th. From TASS Los Angeles, January 13th: First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mikoyan, visited the University of California, one of the highest institutions of learning in the United States, yesterday. Accompanied by University of California President Allen and representatives of the faculty, Mikoyan visited the university's office and teaching buildings, and learned in detail about the largest scientific and statistical materials calculation center recently established in the United States.

　　When the students learned that Mikoyan was visiting, they ran out of the classrooms. The students closely surrounded Mikoyan, crowding towards him, wanting to shake hands with the Soviet guest and welcome him in English and Russian.

　　In his speech, President Allen said that this meeting is very important for the faculty and students of the University of California. Now we warmly welcome First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Mikoyan to visit us. Mr. Allen said, I know that the Deputy Chairman is very interested not only in political and economic issues, but also in education in the United States. Therefore, we are very honored to be able to hear your speech and answer the questions that we are interested in.

　　Then Mikoyan spoke, conveying the warm greetings of the Soviet people to everyone around him and to all the staff of the University of California. Mikoyan said, I have personally seen that the American intellectual community has a great interest in the Soviet Union. This is very natural. After the October Revolution, tremendous changes have taken place in our country, and now the Soviet Union has developed into a powerful socialist country. Now nearly one billion people have embarked on the socialist road. This is a historical fact, and one cannot close one's eyes and ignore these facts. Mikoyan said that it is a great pity that there are many incorrect views circulating in the United States about the lives and work of the Soviet people. He went on to say, but I believe that prejudice will not diminish your interest in the Soviet Union and your desire to study Soviet life, in order to have your own fact-based views on these matters.

　　Mikoyan answered questions raised by the faculty and students of the University of California, who showed great interest in all aspects of Soviet people's lives. Mikoyan spoke in detail about the Soviet Union's reorganization of industry and agriculture. Mikoyan also spoke about the Soviet Union's measures to reform labor remuneration, and about the Soviet state's increasing concern for children and the elderly.

　　During the meeting with the university students, Mikoyan met a black female student named Simone, who is one of the editors of the local student newspaper. Mikoyan's warm handshake with this black girl and his kind conversation with her caused a great sensation among the students. When Mikoyan and his entourage left the University of California, the students gave them a friendly applause.

　　Then Mikoyan attended a banquet held in his honor by the Los Angeles Institute of International Affairs.

　　In the afternoon, Mikoyan and his entourage visited Hollywood by car, where they visited the Paramount Pictures Corporation studio. On the morning of January 13, Mikoyan flew to New York.

    米高扬在洛杉矶访问
    加利福尼亚大学师生热烈欢迎佳宾
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社洛杉矶12日讯：米高扬11日到达了洛杉矶。
    到达后，他在“大使”饭店举行了记者招待会，通过记者向洛杉矶市民传达了苏联人民的问候和良好的祝愿，并且回答了很多问题。
    一个记者问：苏联是否愿意和其他国家分享苏联发射宇宙火箭所获得的科学材料？米高扬回答说，发射宇宙火箭本来就是国际地球物理年计划的一部分，参与实现这个计划的苏联科学家正在同其他国家的科学家交换自己研究工作的成果。他说，由于发射火箭和人造卫星而获得的很多材料都已在报纸上发表。米高扬还谈到旧金山报界和实业界代表对他特别热情的招待。
    晚上米高扬出席了美国电影协会主席约翰斯顿为他举行的宴会。
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社洛杉矶13日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬昨天访问了美国最高学府之一加利福尼亚大学。陪同米高扬参观的有加利福尼亚大学校长艾伦和教职员代表。米高扬参观了大学的办公和教学大楼，详细了解了美国最近建立的最大的科学和统计材料计算中心。
    当学生知道米高扬来参观时都从教室里跑出来了。学生们紧紧地围着米高扬，向他挤去，想同苏联来宾握手，用英语和俄语欢迎他。
    校长艾伦在谈话中说，这次会晤对加利福尼亚大学师生来讲是非常重要的。现在我们都热烈欢迎到我们这里访问的苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬。艾伦先生说，我知道副主席不仅对政治、经济问题，而且对美国的教育都非常感兴趣，因此，我们能够听到您的讲话和回答我们所感兴趣的问题是十分荣幸的。
    接着米高扬讲话，米高扬向周围的人和加利福尼亚大学全体人员转达了苏联人民热烈的问候。米高扬说，我亲眼见到，美国知识界对苏联感到极大兴趣。这是很自然的。在十月革命后，我国发生了巨大的变化，现在苏联已经发展成为一个强大的社会主义国家。现在近十亿的人口走上了社会主义的道路。这是历史事实，不能闭上眼睛不看这些事实。米高扬说，十分遗憾，在美国，对苏联人民的生活和劳动流传着许多不正确的看法。他接着说，但是我认为，成见并不能减少你们对苏联的兴趣和研究苏联生活的愿望，以求你们对这些事情有自己的依据事实的看法。
    米高扬回答了加利福尼亚大学师生所提出的问题，他们对苏联人民生活的各个方面表现了很大的兴趣。米高扬详细谈到苏联改组工农业的情况，米高扬还谈到苏联改革劳动报酬的措施，谈到苏维埃国家越来越关心儿童和老人的情况。
    在同大学生的会见时，米高扬认识了一位黑人女学生西蒙，她是当地学生报纸的编辑之一。米高扬同这位黑人姑娘的热烈握手，以及对这位姑娘的慈祥的谈话使学生们大为轰动。当米高扬同他的随行人员离开加利福尼亚大学时，学生们以友好的掌声欢送他们。
    接着米高扬出席了洛杉矶国际问题学会为他举行的宴会。
    下午米高扬和他的随行人员乘汽车访问了好莱坞，在那里访问了派拉蒙影片公司制片厂。1月13日晨米高扬飞往纽约。
