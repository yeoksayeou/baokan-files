Fine Wine Offered to Chairman Mao (Tibetan Folk Song)
　　The Tibetan family's fine wine is full of deep affection,
　　Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea,
　　Beijing and the grasslands are heart to heart,
　　Offering fine wine, ah, offering our hearts.
　　Raising golden wine glasses with both hands,
　　Standing on the grassland, longing for Beijing,
　　Offering Chairman Mao a cup of wine!
　　Wishing you evergreen like pine and cypress.

    美酒献给毛主席（藏族民歌）藏家的美酒情意深，毛主席的恩情比海深，北京和草原心连心，献上美酒啊献上心。双手举起金色的酒杯，站在草原上想念着北京，献给咱毛主席一杯酒呀！祝你像松柏一样万年青。
