    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Beijing scientific circles today celebrated with even greater joy the Soviet Union's space rocket safely passing through the moon's vicinity. At a symposium held this afternoon jointly by the China Association for Science and Technology and the preparatory committee of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology, scientific workers all said that the news of the Soviet Union's space rocket reaching the moon's vicinity according to plan did not surprise them at all, because they were deeply convinced of the correctness of the Soviet Union's scientific and technological work. The Soviet Union does what it says, while the United States only brags and talks big.
    The symposium was chaired by Zhou Peiyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the China Association for Science and Technology and Vice President of Peking University. A common understanding among the sentiments expressed by many scientists was that the Soviet rocket reached the second cosmic velocity, and the use of precise automatic control technology allowed this space rocket to operate in a predetermined orbit. This is the crystallization of the high achievements of many disciplines and engineering technologies. Such a great scientific achievement demonstrates the victory of the communist large-scale collaboration and planning of Soviet science and technology, which is impossible to achieve in capitalist society. Under the capitalist system, scientific work, like the economy, is characterized by mutual exclusion and secrecy. The failure of the United States to successfully launch four lunar rockets is a very important reason for this.
    Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, said that the Soviet Union's successful launch of the first artificial planet in the solar system is the glory of the Earth. Nie Chunrong, Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the China Association for Science and Technology, said that this great scientific initiative of the Soviet Union makes it clearer to the people of the world that socialism is like the rising sun, while capitalism is already setting in the west; this space rocket helps people make the right choice between these two paths. Huang Ziqing, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Chemical Society, believes that this amazing scientific achievement of the Soviet Union can show that the Soviet Union far surpasses the United States in national defense strength, so it is a huge contribution to defending world peace and stopping imperialist aggression. He said that the successful launch of the space rocket shows that the Soviet Union has reached the world's most advanced level in both engineering technology and scientific theory. Wang Mingzhi, Vice Chairman of the China Civil Engineering Society, said that the enlightenment gained from this major scientific achievement of the Soviet Union is that scientific work must be carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party, and communist large-scale collaboration must be implemented; scientific workers must work with workers and peasants to run science together, so that science can advance by leaps and bounds.
    Tu Shancheng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Association of Automation, technically compared the advantages and disadvantages of the Soviet Union's space rocket and the already failed lunar rocket of the United States. He said that the main technical reason for the failure of the United States to launch lunar rockets four times may be due to very imprecise automatic control. The successful entry of the Soviet space rocket into orbit and its flight past the vicinity of the moon shows that the main part of its automatic control – the navigation system – has reached a high degree of precision, and its level has far surpassed that of capitalist countries. Li Minhua, Secretary-General of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, said that it can now be predicted that in the near future, the Soviet Union's rocket technology will reach the third cosmic velocity. She estimated that the Soviet Union's space rocket may have used high-energy fuel or even atomic energy power. She said that both atomic energy power and high-energy fuel will cause many new problems in the mechanics of materials. The successful launch of the Soviet space rocket shows that the Soviet Union has reached an outstanding level in a series of aspects such as atomic energy, high-energy fuel, high-temperature materials, and automatic control.
    Chen Weiji, Chairman of the China Textile Engineering Society, Wang Junkui, Professor of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Lin Shie, Zhao Jinyi, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Astronomical Society, Hu Chuan Kui, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, and others all gave speeches. More than 30 scientific workers attended the symposium.

    苏联说得到做得到
    我国科学家盛赞苏联征服宇宙的新胜利
    新华社4日讯　北京科学界今天以更加喜悦的心情庆贺苏联宇宙火箭安全越过月球区域。今天下午在中国科学技术协会和北京科学技术协会筹委会联合举行的座谈会上，科学工作者们都说苏联宇宙火箭按照计划到达月球区域的消息一点也不使他们感到意外，因为他们对于苏联的科学技术工作的正确性是深信不疑的，苏联是说得到做得到的，而美国则是光吹牛、说大话。
    这个座谈会由中国科协书记处书记、北京大学副校长周培源主持。许多科学家发表的感想中的一个共同认识是：苏联火箭达到了第二宇宙速度，并且用精确的自动控制技术使这支宇宙火箭在预定的轨道中运行，这是许多门学科和工程技术高度成就的结晶，这样伟大的科学成就表明了苏联科学技术的共产主义大协作和计划性的胜利，而这正是资本主义社会所无法实现的，在资本主义制度下，科学工作和经济一样，只有互相排斥、互相保密。美国放了四颗月球火箭不能成功，这是其中一个很重要的原因。
    中国科协副主席茅以升说，苏联成功地发射了第一颗太阳系的人造行星，是地球的光荣。中国科协书记处常务书记聂春荣说，苏联这一伟大的科学创举，使全世界人民更清楚看到：社会主义正如旭日东升，资本主义已是日落西山；这支宇宙火箭有助于人们在这两条道路中进行正确的抉择。中国化学会副理事长黄子卿认为苏联这一惊人的科学成就可以表明苏联在国防力量上远远超过了美国，所以对于保卫世界和平、制止帝国主义侵略是一桩巨大的贡献。他说从宇宙火箭的发射成功可看出苏联在工程技术和科学理论上都达到了世界最先进的水平。中国土木工程学会副理事长王明之说，从苏联这一重大科学成就得到的启示是：科学工作一定要在共产党的领导下，实行共产主义大协作；科学工作者要和工农劳动人民一起大家办科学，才能使科学飞跃前进。
    中国自动化学会秘书长屠善澄从技术上比较了苏联宇宙火箭和美国已经失败的月球火箭的优劣。他说，美国四度施放月球火箭失败，技术上的主要原因可能是由于自动控制很不精确。苏联宇宙火箭成功进入轨道，飞过了月球附近，这表明它的自动控制的主要部分——导航系统达到了高度的精确，它的水平已经远远超过了资本主义国家。中国力学会秘书长李敏华说，现在可以预言，不久的将来苏联的火箭技术就会达到第三宇宙速度。她估计苏联这支宇宙火箭很可能采用了高能燃料甚至采用了原子能动力，她说，不论是原子能动力还是高能燃料，都要引起材料力学上的许多新问题。苏联宇宙火箭的发射成功，说明苏联在原子能、高能燃料、高温材料、自动控制等一系列方面都达到了卓越的水平。
    中国纺织工程学会理事长陈维稷、北京航空学院教授王俊奎、林士谔、中国天文学会北京分会理事长赵进义、中华医学会副会长胡传揆等都发表了感言。参加座谈会的科学工作者共有三十多人。
