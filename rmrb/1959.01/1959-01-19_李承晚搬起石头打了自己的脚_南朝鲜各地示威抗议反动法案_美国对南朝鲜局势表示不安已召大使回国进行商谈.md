Xinhua News Agency Report: As a result of the Syngman Rhee clique’s violent and despicable passage of the fascist "New National Security Law" at the end of last year, the rising sentiment against American occupation and Syngman Rhee's rule has not been suppressed. Instead, it has provoked even greater anger among people from all walks of life in South Korea towards the Syngman Rhee clique. Disregarding the Syngman Rhee clique’s brutal suppression, they have launched a struggle against amending the "National Security Law" for days.

Since the beginning of this year, anti-Syngman Rhee marches and demonstrations have taken place one after another in Seoul, Daegu, Busan, Incheon and other places. Young students have written letters in blood to express their protests. The Syngman Rhee clique dispatched large numbers of police and secret agents twice, on the 7th and 13th, to forcibly suppress the protest rallies of representatives from all walks of life held in Seoul.

On the 14th, people from all walks of life continued to hold demonstrations and parades in major cities in South Korea against amending the "National Security Law." Ten demonstrators in front of the "National Assembly" in Seoul were arrested. In Busan, demonstrators clashed with the police, and six people were thrown into prison. In Daegu, about six thousand citizens prepared to hold a demonstration, but the Syngman Rhee clique dispatched a large number of police to block traffic from early morning, making large-scale demonstrations and rallies impossible. However, small groups of people still held parades, and the police immediately arrested more than a dozen opposition leaders.

At the same time, the "Senior Prosecutors' Meeting" held in the office of Syngman Rhee's Minister of Justice on the 14th decided to take out the already-defunct "Ordinance No. 55" of the American military government to suppress all activities against the "New National Security Law." This "military government ordinance" was formulated by the American imperialists to suppress the activities of the South Korean people in striving for democracy after the people in northern Korea were liberated. It has long been declared invalid by the Syngman Rhee clique’s own "constitution." Now, because it is panicked by the increasingly high struggle of the South Korean people against the "New National Security Law," it has decided to take it out again to suppress the people's resistance to the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique. On the 15th, the Syngman Rhee clique even invoked the terms of the bill to arrest a reporter from the "Korean Economic News" who had exposed the ugly deeds of the Syngman Rhee clique in the newspaper.

In view of the "deteriorating political developments" in South Korea, the U.S. government suddenly recalled Dowling for consultations on the political situation in South Korea. Dowling left Seoul on the 16th to return to the United States. According to reports by the South Korean "Chosun Ilbo" and "Hankook Ilbo" on the 17th, Dowling, while passing through Tokyo, met with reporters from these two newspapers and expressed concern about the movement of the South Korean people and the opposition Democratic Party against the Syngman Rhee clique's forcing the "National Assembly" to pass the "New National Security Law." Dowling expressed his hope that the Democratic Party and the Syngman Rhee clique could reach a "political compromise."

    李承晚搬起石头打了自己的脚
    南朝鲜各地示威抗议反动法案
    美国对南朝鲜局势表示不安已召大使回国进行商谈
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：李承晚集团在去年年底用暴力和各种卑鄙手段通过法西斯法案——“新国家保安法”的结果，不但没有把日益高涨的反对美国占领和李承晚统治的情绪压下去，反而激起了南朝鲜各界人士对李承晚集团的更大的愤怒。他们连日不顾李承晚集团的残酷镇压，开展了反对修改“国家保安法”的斗争。
    今年以来，汉城、大丘、釜山、仁川等地接连发生反对李承晚的游行示威，青年学生写血书表示抗议。李承晚集团曾经在7日和13日两次出动大批警察特务，用武力镇压在汉城举行的各界代表的抗议集会。
    14日，在南朝鲜各大城市中，各界人士继续举行反对修改“国家保安法”的示威游行。在汉城“国会”会场前面示威的群众有十名被捕。在釜山，示威者同警察发生冲突，有六名被投入监狱。在大丘，大约有六千名市民准备举行示威，李承晚集团出动了大批警察，从清晨起就封锁交通，使大规模的示威和集会无法举行，但是仍然有小批群众举行了游行，警察随即逮捕了十多名反对党领袖。
    与此同时，14日在李承晚的法务部长官办公室举行的“高级检事会议”决定拿出早已失效的美国军政府的“第五十五号法令”来镇压一切反对“新国家保安法”的活动。这项“军政府法令”是美帝国主义者在朝鲜北部人民获得解放以后为压制南朝鲜人民争取民主的活动而制定的。早已被李承晚集团自己的“宪法”宣布无效。现在它因为对南朝鲜人民反对“新国家保安法”的日益高涨的斗争感到恐慌，竟决定重新拿出来镇压人民对美帝国主义者以及李承晚集团的反抗情绪。15日，李承晚集团并且已经援引法案的条款逮捕了一名曾经在报纸上揭露李承晚集团丑行的“韩国经济新闻”的记者。
    鉴于南朝鲜“日益恶化的政局发展”，美国政府突然召回陶林，以便就南朝鲜的政治局势进行商谈。陶林已经在16日离开汉城回国。据南朝鲜“朝鲜时报”和“韩国日报”17日报道，陶林在途经东京接见这两家报纸的记者时，对南朝鲜人民和反对党民主党反对李承晚集团强使“国会”通过“新国家保安法”的运动感到不安，陶林表示希望民主党同李承晚集团能够达成
  “政治妥协”。（附图片）
