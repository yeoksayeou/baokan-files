Xinhua News Agency, 13th - The Ministry of Commerce recently held a telephone conference. Based on the principle of grasping both the major and the minor, and addressing both domestic and wild products, the Ministry called on commercial departments in all regions to seize the current opportunity of diversified operations in people's communes, to launch the procurement of local and waste products, and to achieve results in a short period, while vigorously purchasing major agricultural and sideline products.

The telephone conference was held on the evening of the 10th. Zhang Yongli, Vice Minister of Commerce, emphasized the significance of doing a good job in the procurement of local and waste products. He said that the procurement of local and waste products is closely related to national economic construction, industrial and agricultural production, people's lives, and supporting exports. For example, basic construction and farmland water conservancy construction require large amounts of Mao bamboo, reed mats, palm fibers, and bamboo, willow, and bramble woven products as materials and tools for well-digging, shed-building, and shoring; the metallurgical industry needs large amounts of saltpeter for blasting mountains and mining; the chemical industry needs large amounts of native alkali, mirabilite, Chinese gall, turpentine, and wild oils as raw materials; and light industry needs wild fibers, waste cotton, and tannin for papermaking, textile, and leather-making. Some local products, such as ceramics, bamboo and wood products, straw mats, brooms, and cooking utensils, are necessities for the daily lives of the people, and commercial departments must ensure their supply. Other local products, such as straw braid, native paper, raw lacquer, aromatic oils, Chinese gall, and malian grass roots, are China's traditional export goods and have great economic value. From the perspective of the vast rural areas, local products have always accounted for a significant proportion of China's agricultural economy and are an important aspect of people's communes developing diversified operations and developing commodity production.

Zhang Yongli said that since the procurement of local and sideline products is so closely related to national construction and people's economic life, all regions must pay sufficient attention to it. While vigorously purchasing major agricultural products, they must seize the opportunity to do a good job in the procurement of small local products. Currently, it is the peak season for the production of many local products, and party committees at all levels are combining rectification with a major effort to promote winter sideline production. Commercial departments must seize this opportunity to fully support the development of local product production in people's communes and launch a high tide of purchasing local and waste products to meet the needs of all parties.

Zhang Yongli said that because there are many varieties of local and waste products, and the scope of procurement is relatively broad, the procurement should be arranged in a planned way. First, it is necessary to grasp the major, large-scale products that are of great importance to industrial and agricultural production, but also not abandon the minor and small-scale products. There must be a distinction between the important and the urgent. The general policy for the procurement of local and waste products is "grasping both large and small, taking into account both primary and secondary, making overall arrangements, and each achieving its effect." The smaller and more minor the varieties are, the easier they are to be overlooked, so it is necessary to take into account the overall situation and make comprehensive arrangements. Commercial departments in all regions should take the initiative to help people's communes make good plans for the production of local products. For commodities managed by the state, purchase and sales contracts should be used to closely integrate the procurement plans of commercial departments with the production plans of communes, and conduct organized procurement. Commercial departments should vigorously assist in solving the difficulties of people's communes in terms of production raw materials, tools, technology, and funds.

At the telephone conference, the Ministry of Commerce also made arrangements for the procurement tasks of more than 20 major local and waste products such as scrap copper, Mao bamboo, palm fibers, raw lacquer, native paper, Chinese gall, Chinese medicinal materials, and cotton stalk skin in 1959, and required all regions to pay special attention to the current production season for local products such as Mao bamboo, reed mats, and saltpeter, and quickly make achievements in procurement work.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th - Commercial departments in some regions are seizing the opportunity to purchase local products.

Commercial departments in some regions have paid attention to grasping the procurement of local and sideline products at the beginning of this year. In late December last year, Hebei Province held a symposium on the purchase and sale of local and special products in seven prefectures and seven key counties throughout the province, and formulated a procurement plan for local and sideline products. At present, commercial departments throughout the province are making great efforts to purchase reed mats, saltpeter, and bramble and willow woven products. Zhejiang Province also deployed the work of helping communes develop diversified operations and expand the procurement of local products as early as November last year, and held on-site meetings to exchange experiences. Now, the procurement of local products in the province is focusing on bamboo, firewood, charcoal, and wild plants, and is being carried out in depth. According to recent statistics from 39 counties in Jilin Province, more than 20 kinds of local products, such as wild animal fur, sheep grass, native baskets, native saltpeter, grass bags, reeds, and native alkali, have been purchased at the beginning of this year, with a total value of more than 8.88 million yuan.

In the procurement of local products, the commercial departments in these regions generally help people's communes formulate production plans for developing diversified operations based on local resources and production conditions, restore and develop the original production, find new production avenues, provide support in terms of raw materials and technology, and connect the production plans of people's communes with the national procurement plans through purchase and sales contracts, thus greatly promoting the development of commodity production and strengthening the planning of commodity production. According to statistics in Zhejiang Province by mid-December last year, commercial departments have helped communes restore and build more than 3,500 aromatic oil factories, alcohol factories, tannin factories, wild fiber factories, forest chemical factories, and native saltpeter and alkali factories.

    大宗小宗都抓　主要次要兼顾
    多收快收土产品
    商业部要求各地认真作好土产和废品收购工作
    新华社13日讯　商业部最近召开电话会议，根据既要抓大的，又要抓小的，既要抓家生的，又要抓野生的原则，要求各地商业部门在大力收购主要农副产品的同时，抓紧当前人民公社多种经营时机，展开土产品和废品的收购工作，并在短时期内做出成绩。
    这次电话会议是在10日晚上举行的。商业部副部长张永励在会上着重说明了做好土产、废品收购工作的意义。他说，土产、废品的收购和国家经济建设、工农业生产和人民生活以及支援出口都有着密切的关系。例如基本建设和农田水利建设，需要大量的毛竹、苇席、棕片和竹柳荆草编制品，作为打井、搭棚、支架的材料和工具；冶金工业需要大量火硝来炸山开矿；化学工业需要大量土碱、皮硝、五棓子、松节油和野生油脂等作为原料；轻工业需要野生纤维、废棉和栲胶等作为造纸、纺织和制革的原料。有一部分土产品，如陶瓷器、竹木制品、草席、扫帚、炊事用具等，都是人民群众日常生活所必需，商业部门要保证供应，还有一部分土产品，如草帽辫、土纸、生漆、芳香油、五棓子、马连根等，是我国传统的出口物资，有很大的经济价值。从广大农村来看，土产历来在我国农业经济中占相当大的比重，是人民公社开展多种经营、发展商品生产的一个重要方面。
    张永励说，既然土副产品的收购与国家建设、人民经济生活有如此密切的关系，各地必须对此引起足够的重视，要在大力收购大宗农产品的同时，抓紧做好小土产的收购工作。目前正是许多土产品生产的旺季，各级党委正在结合整社大抓冬季副业生产，商业部门必须抓紧这一时机，全力支持人民公社发展土产品的生产，掀起一个采购土产和废品的高潮，以满足各方面的需要。
    张永励说，由于土产、废品的品种繁多，收购的范围比较广，因此在收购时应当有所安排，首先要抓主要的、大宗的、对工农业生产关系重大的，但是也不能放弃次要的、小宗的，要有轻重缓急之分。土产品和废品收购工作总的方针是
  “大小都抓，主次兼顾，统筹安排，各收其效”，越是小宗的次要的品种越容易被忽视，所以必须统筹兼顾，全面安排。各地商业部门要主动帮助人民公社作好土产品生产规划，对于国家管理的商品，应该通过产销合同，把商业部门的采购计划与公社的生产计划密切结合起来，进行有组织的收购。对于人民公社在生产原料、工具、技术、资金等方面的困难，商业部门应大力协助解决。
    在这次电话会议上，商业部还对1959年杂铜、毛竹、棕片、生漆、土纸、五棓子、中药材、棉秆皮等二十多种主要土产品和废品的收购任务作了布置，并要求各地对毛竹、苇席、火硝等土产品，要特别抓紧当前的生产季节，迅速在收购工作上做出成绩。
    据新华社13日讯　部分地区商业部门正在抓紧收购土产品。
    部分地区的商业部门在今年一开始就注意抓紧了土副产品的收购工作。河北省在去年12月下旬召开了全省七个专区和七个重点县的土特产品购销工作座谈会，制订了土副产品的收购规划。目前全省商业部门正在大抓苇席、火硝、荆柳草编制品的收购。浙江省也早在去年11月间就布置了帮助公社开展多种经营，扩大土产品收购的工作，并且召开现场会议交流经验，现在全省土产品收购工作正以竹、柴、炭和野生植物为重点，深入地展开。吉林省据三十九个县最近统计，今年初已收购野生动物皮毛、羊草、土篮、土硝、草袋、苇子、土碱等二十多种土产，总值达八百八十八万余元。
    在土产品采购工作中，这些地区的商业部门一般都根据当地资源和生产条件，帮助人民公社制订发展多种经营的生产规划，恢复与发展原有的生产，寻找新的生产门路，在原料、技术等方面加以支持，并通过购销合同，把人民公社的生产规划和国家收购计划衔接起来，因而大大促进了商品生产的发展，加强了商品生产的计划性。浙江省到去年12月中旬统计，商业部门已帮助公社恢复和新建芳香油厂、酒精厂、栲胶厂、野生纤维厂、林产化工厂、土硝土碱厂共三千五百多个。（附图片）
