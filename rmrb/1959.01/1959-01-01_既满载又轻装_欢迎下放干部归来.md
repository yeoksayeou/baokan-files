Both Loaded and Lightly Equipped
——Welcome Back Cadres Who Were Sent Down
Xie Juezai

Last year on New Year's Day, we bid farewell to cadres going down to the countryside; this year on New Year's Day, we welcome them back.

In just one year, our country and people have undergone unprecedented and decisive changes. The total value of industrial and agricultural production has more than doubled or nearly doubled; the people, with soaring enthusiasm, dare to think and dare to do, with full commune and national collaboration, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military are all involved. Individualistic habits are not popular, and the communist style is flourishing.

This is no longer just an emotional "transformation from one class to another" (note), but rather our society is moving from one world into another. This world is great gospel for mankind, and great distress for the exploiting classes – the likes of the imperialist Dulles. Dulles, when he does speak, vehemently curses the Communist Party, especially our People's Communes. Dulles, after all, has a brain; he knows that with the rise of this world, his world will "disappear," and there is no way to save its "disappearance."

Cadre labor training, last year, had new regulations. Any cadre with labor power must participate in physical labor for at least one month each year; schools run farms and factories, and farms and factories also run schools. The combination of education and labor has become a trend and has shown amazing results.

The cadres sent down by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to Zhangcunyizhen Township in Fu County, Shaanxi Province, worked for a year and have returned to the Ministry at the end of the year. They are all full of energy and beaming with joy. They said: "When we first arrived, we were always somewhat distant from the farmers. If you didn't look for them, they wouldn't come to you. After living, eating, and working together, we quickly became one with them, as close as family and good friends.

"Intellectuals who have never labored before initially got blisters, even swelling and pain, on their hands, feet, and shoulders. But as long as they endured for a few days, when the skin thickened and the bones hardened, they could run as fast as anyone carrying soil and manure. Their bodies were actually not bad, but they had been spoiled. Now they have returned to their original state.

"The farmers gave us food to eat. They have accumulated a lot of knowledge. In the past, we didn't know the difficulties of farming, nor the noble qualities of the farmers, and instead looked down on them. The farmers work hard all year round, but their lives are not good or not very good. They have no complaints, no discouragement, and always keep working.

Zhangcunyizhen had a bumper harvest this year. Of the three production brigades we participated in, two increased production by more than 100%; the other also increased considerably. A total of 25 tons of iron were smelted. This was mainly due to the strength of the local Party and the masses; we contributed very little. But the county and commune Party committees awarded us banners and model titles, and wanted us to serve as deputy party branch secretaries, deputy commune directors, and deputy team leaders. In particular, the broad masses of people did not want us to leave, and we did not want to leave them. They slaughtered pigs for farewell dinners, some teams slaughtering more than one. They sent us off with gongs and drums, many people shedding tears, sending us off for mile after mile. This made us deeply feel the incomparable warmth of the working class.

"We deeply appreciate this time sent down. It was a decisive training from the Party for us. We only did too little and still have many shortcomings. We must continue to engage in labor to train ourselves, and continue to learn from labor to enhance our knowledge and ability."

Yes, one year of labor is better than reading books for ten years, better than staying in the office for ten years. Their gains are great. Naturally, they must continue to work hard to contribute more effectively to socialist construction. I give them a poem: The four limbs unused, formerly criticized, now labor is glorious. It's not just that the autumn harvest of vegetables and grains is good, but the skin has darkened and the heart has reddened. Wheat, beans, sorghum stalks are indistinguishable, soil, fertilizer, water, planting density must be known. Wearing clothes and eating is not easy, only then do you believe the farmers are my teachers. Some people get up early to sweep diligently, some people cross the Hulu River on a rainy night. The style of everyone for everyone is good, and fat pigs must be slaughtered before leaving. Returning, both loaded and lightly equipped, face full of spring breeze and eyes full of light. How many problems have been dropped, body and mind from now on even stronger.

Note: Last year, when sending cadres from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the countryside, I wrote an article "Transformation from one class to another."

Also: A comrade, as a literacy teacher, had to cross the Hulu River every night to teach. One night it rained, and the students thought the teacher would not come, but the comrade went, and the students were greatly moved, so they studied harder, and the results were the best.

    既满载又轻装
    ——欢迎下放干部归来
    谢觉哉
    去年元旦，欢送干部下放，今年元旦，欢迎下放干部归来。
    仅仅一年的时间，我们的国家和人民，起了史所未有的决定性的变化。工业农业的生产的总值增加一倍以上或将近一倍；人民呢，干劲冲天，敢想敢做，全社全民大协作，工农商学兵一齐办。个人主义的习气不吃香，共产主义的风格大兴起。
    这已经不只是感情上“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”（注），而已经是我们的社会从一个世界走进另一个世界。这个世界是人类的大福音，是剥削阶级——帝国主义杜勒斯之流的大苦恼。杜勒斯最近不说话则已，一说就要大骂共产党，尤其要骂我们的人民公社。杜勒斯毕竟是有头脑的人，他知道这个世界的兴起，它那个世界就要“消逝”，而且已经没有法子挽救它的“消逝”。
    干部劳动锻炼，去年有新的规定，任何有劳动力的干部，每年至少要参加体力劳动一个月；学校办农场工厂，农场工厂也办学校，教育与劳动结合成为风气，且已显出惊人的成绩。
    内务部下放干部在陕西鄜县张村驿乡，劳动了一年，年底回部了，他们个个精神饱满、面有春风。他们说：“初去时和农民总有点距离，你不去找他，他不来找你。经过三同，很快就打成一片，亲如一家人、如好朋友了。
    “从没劳动过的知识分子，开始是手上足上肩上起泡甚至肿痛，但只要忍过几天，皮厚了、骨硬了，挑土挑粪一样可以飞跑。身体本来不错，只怪自己娇坏了，现在才复了原。
    “农民给我们饭吃，他们积累了很多知识，过去我们不知道稼穑之艰难，也不知道农民高贵的品质，反而看农民不起。农民终年辛苦，生活却并不好或不大好，他们无怨言、不灰心，总是这样劳动下去。
    张村驿今年丰产了，我们参加的三个大队，有两个大队增产一倍以上；另一个大队也增加不少。炼铁一共出二十五吨。主要是当地党和群众的力量，我们出力很少。但县和社的党委给我们奖旗，模范称号，要我们担任党副支书、副社长、副队长等重要职务。特别是广大群众，他们不愿我们走，我们也不愿离开他们。杀猪饯行，有的队还不止杀一头。打锣打鼓地送，许多人流着泪，送一程又一程。使我们深深感受到劳动阶级群众无比的温暖。
    “我们深深感谢这次下放，是党对我们一次有决定性的培养，只是我们做得太少、缺点还多，必须继续从事劳动锻炼自己，继续从劳动中学习以增强自己的知识和能力。”
    是的，一年劳动，比读十年书要强，比呆在机关里工作十年要强。他们的收获是很大的，自然还须继续努力，求能对社会主义建设贡献更大的效用。赠以诗曰：四体不勤昔所斥，而今劳动是光荣。岂止秋收蔬谷好，黑了皮肤红了心。麦豆秫粱秸不辨，土肥水种密须知。穿衣吃饭非容易，才信农民是我师。有人早起勤洒扫，有人雨夜渡胡卢。（注）我为人人风格好，临行都要杀肥猪。归来满载又轻装，脸有春风目有光。问题丢掉知多少，体脑从兹更健强。
    注：去年送内务部干部下放，写过一篇“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”的文章。
    又：有一同志当扫盲教员，每夜须过胡卢河去教课，一夜下雨，学生以为教员不会来，但该同志去了，学生大感动，因而学习加紧，成绩最佳。
