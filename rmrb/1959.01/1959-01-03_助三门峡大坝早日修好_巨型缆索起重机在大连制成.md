Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, January 1st: A cable crane, which will play a significant role in accelerating the concrete pouring work of the Sanmenxia Dam, was successfully trial-produced at the Dalian Hoisting Machine Factory on the eve of the New Year. It will soon be transported to the Sanmenxia construction site for final installation.

This cable crane is a gigantic machine weighing 2,000 tons. It is composed of two 70-meter-high iron towers connected by four thick carrying cables. When installed, the entire machine looks like a majestic triumphal arch spanning both banks of the Yellow River. The lifting capacity of this cable crane is 20 tons. Operated by seven or eight people, it can lift and transport six cubic meters of concrete at a time, with a traveling speed of 360 meters per minute, equivalent to the workload of 2,500 manual workers. This cable crane is not a permanent piece of equipment for the Sanmenxia project. After the project there is completed, it will be transferred to other projects.

The cable crane is one of the large, precision products manufactured by the system of the First Ministry of Machine Building of China in 1958. Its entire working process is controlled by workers through electrical devices. It is equipped with modern instruments such as wireless telephones and automatic anemometers. In the event of a severe storm that may cause danger, it can automatically stop working in advance. Workers can use elevators to go up and down the operating platform.

This cable crane was jointly manufactured by nearly 30 units including the Third Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the North China Metal Structure Factory, and the Dalian Hoisting Machine Factory. With the help of experts from the German Democratic Republic, these units, through vigorous mass movements, designed and manufactured it in just over five months, more than six months ahead of schedule.

### 助三门峡大坝早日修好  巨型缆索起重机在大连制成

    助三门峡大坝早日修好
    巨型缆索起重机在大连制成
    新华社旅大1日电　大连起重机器厂在新年前夕试制成功一台对加速三门峡大坝混凝土浇灌工程有重大作用的缆索起重机。最近它就要运往三门峡工地进行总安装。
    这台缆索起重机是一个重达二千吨的庞然大物。它由两座七十公尺高的铁塔和四根粗大的承载缆索连接组成，整个机器安装起来像一座巍峨的凯旋门，可以横跨黄河两岸。这台缆索起重机的起重能力为二十吨，由七、八个人管理，一次可以吊运六立方公尺混凝土，行驶速度每分钟三百六十公尺，相当于二千五百个工人手工操作的工作量。这台缆索起重机不是三门峡工程的永久性设备。当那里的工程结束以后，它就要转移到其他工程上去。
    缆索起重机是我国第一机械工业部系统1958年制成的大型的、精密的产品之一。它的工作过程，都由工人通过电气化装置操纵。上边设有无线电话和自动测风等现代化仪器，在大风暴袭来有可能造成危险的时候，能预先自动停止工作。工人们可乘着电梯上下操作台。
    这台缆索起重机是由第一机械工业部三局、华北金属结构厂等近三十个单位和大连起重机器厂协作制成的。这些单位在民主德国专家的帮助下，通过大搞群众运动，仅用了五个多月的时间就设计制造成功，比预定时间提前了六个多月。
