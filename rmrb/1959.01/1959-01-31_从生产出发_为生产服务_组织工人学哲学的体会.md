Starting from Production, Serving Production
Experiences in Organizing Workers to Study Philosophy
The Chinese Communist Party Tianjin Food Processing Factory No. 1 Committee

We began organizing workers to study philosophy in June of last year. At that time, only twenty-three people participated in the study group, but it gradually expanded to more than 1,200 people. With the exception of those with very low levels of education, 60% of the factory's employees actively participated in the study, forming a vigorous and enthusiastic movement to study philosophy. In the past six months or so, in conjunction with the political movements of the period, and in light of the problems existing in production and in the thinking of the workers, we have explained several dialectical materialist viewpoints such as "the theory of imbalance," "starting from reality," "the subjective initiative of people," and "two types of contradictions." In the process of carrying out socialist and communist education, we also discussed some philosophical theories with "People's Communes" and "Working Hard and Skillfully for Socialist Construction" as the main content. Through study, everyone not only developed a strong interest in studying philosophy, but also gained a preliminary understanding of some basic knowledge of Marxist philosophy, and was able to use it to analyze and solve many problems in production and ideology, thereby greatly promoting the rapid development of production and technological revolution. Our factory achieved mechanization ahead of schedule before the 1958 National Day, fundamentally changing the face of production. This leap in technological revolution was, of course, the result of correctly handling contradictions among the people after the rectification movement, and a great victory in conscientiously implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction under the leadership of the higher Party committee, but it was also inseparable from the workers' study of philosophy. If workers study philosophy well, they can effectively enhance the communist consciousness and level of understanding of the broad masses of workers, vigorously promote technological revolution, and promote the great development of production.

The Key Problems in Production Are the Topics for Discussing Philosophy

To organize workers to study philosophy, we must first clarify the purpose of studying. Without solving this problem, we cannot implement the teaching principle of integrating theory with practice well, nor can we closely integrate it with production. When we first started organizing workers to study, although we generally knew that workers studied philosophy to arm the minds of the working masses with Marxist philosophy and improve their theoretical and political ideological level, when it came to specific study, the leadership was unsure, and the learning methods were also incorrect. We followed the old method of telling everyone about "philosophical common sense," and as a result, the workers responded by saying: "The factory director talked for a long time, and it's a little embarrassing to say it's bad, but to be honest, we just don't understand it, and this has nothing to do with us," "It's like a blind man lighting a lamp, a waste of wax, wouldn't it be better to learn a few more words with that time?" These were all very sharp criticisms of our leadership. In this situation, we held a Party committee meeting to study and clarify that workers' study of philosophy should serve production, start from reality, and then use philosophical weapons to analyze and solve practical problems to promote the development of production. After this guiding ideology was clarified, we immediately changed our original approach, and took the key problems in production and technological revolution as the topics for lecturing on philosophy to the workers. As a result, it was universally welcomed and had good results. This made the workers' philosophical study develop vividly and vigorously.

Studying Philosophy Increases Ambition, Manual Operation Becomes Machine

Whether the teaching principle of practice—theory—practice can be implemented in the study is the key to the success or failure of the study. And how can this principle be effectively implemented? We feel that the important issue lies in whether the leadership can propose topics from practice, and whether these practical problems can be analyzed from the perspective of dialectical materialism. Empty big principles that are not combined with practice will not solve problems, and only talking about practice without rising to theory will also make workers feel uninterested and fail to achieve the purpose of improving understanding and promoting production. In the process of vigorously engaging in technological revolution and realizing the mechanization of production, some cadres and workers only saw unfavorable conditions, emphasized difficulties in every possible way, and lacked confidence and courage. Some said: There are no engineers, not even a technician who can draw drawings, 90% of the workers are manual workers, and they have never even touched a machine; most people have only a primary school education or are illiterate, and it is simply a dream to invent machines. Some said: The egg-beating business is manual work, and egg production in capitalist countries is also manual, and so on. These ideas were a major obstacle to mechanization, and if they were not refuted, the technological revolution could not be carried out smoothly. In response to this kind of problem, we studied "Subjective Initiative," so that employees understood in theory that giving full play to people's subjective initiative can change the current backward state of production and eliminate the pain of heavy labor intensity and occupational diseases caused by manual operation; it can overcome various difficulties and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. Through study and debate, the confidence of employees was greatly boosted. Some said: "Studying philosophy increases ambition, and manual operation becomes machine." The idea of being content with the status quo was criticized, the minds of the employees were greatly liberated, and a vigorous upsurge of technological revolution immediately appeared in the whole factory. In just twenty days, more than 4,500 suggestions for technical innovation were put forward, and 1,225 items were adopted and implemented, and six machines were created one after another, so that the key problems of realizing the mechanization of the main production processes of the whole factory were basically solved.

In addition, we explained the issue of "balance and imbalance" to everyone with the actual situation of breaking through production leap targets five times. For example, in the year before last, our factory's egg-beating department produced 75 tons of frozen eggs per day, and the barrel-making department produced 5,100 barrels per day, which were compatible with each other. After the Great Leap Forward last year, egg-beating production increased by 50%, while barrel-making production remained at the original level, unable to meet the needs of egg-beating production, resulting in an imbalance. Through the efforts of all the employees of the barrel-making department, the daily output of barrels was increased from 5,100 to 12,500, meeting the needs of egg-beating production. The contradiction was resolved, reaching a new balance, and making the entire production move forward one step. Balance, imbalance, and rebalancing, exposing contradictions and solving contradictions are the objective laws of production moving forward. Because everyone gave full play to their subjective initiative on the one hand, and respected the objective laws of development on the other hand, the development of production was guaranteed. And from here, everyone understood that balance is temporary and relative, and imbalance is the constant absolute truth, and understood the method of analyzing contradictions and solving contradictions. Therefore, when studying problems, they all earnestly looked for contradictions, and after talking about it, they discovered the problem: the leadership proposed to first realize the mechanization of the egg-candling process, which would require a large number of egg-candling washing machines, but there was a lack of technical personnel. Most of the technical personnel were in the barrel-welding group of the barrel-making department. If they were drawn out, it would affect the completion of the barrel-making task, which was a major contradiction. How to solve it? For example, old worker Wei Changgeng said: The main aspect of this contradiction is in the barrel-welding group. If barrel-welding is mechanized, people will be saved. He also proposed a solution: to glue the ice egg barrels with special glue like canned goods. According to his opinion, research and experiments were carried out, and finally it was successful. Due to the realization of this technical innovation, fifty technicians were saved to support the manufacture of egg-candling washing machines, and after another seven days and nights of assault, the egg-candling process was mechanized, saving 200 laborers. The masses reflected that "studying philosophy means more methods." As a result of the employees giving play to their subjective initiative and respecting objective laws, the task of mechanizing production, which we had originally planned to complete in two years, was fully realized before the 1958 National Day.

It Is Both Studying Production Problems and Conducting Collective Lesson Preparation

Organically combine workers' study of philosophy with the completion of production tasks, study theory according to the actual needs of production, and make theory directly serve production. In this way, workers' study of philosophy is not only not contradictory to the completion of production tasks, but also can vigorously promote the completion of production tasks. The philosophical topics we talk about are all proposed through the study of production. When the Party committee studies the problems in production and technological revolution, it consciously uses philosophical viewpoints to analyze them, proposes key problems and solutions and opinions through collective discussion, and then assigns special personnel to sort them out according to the spirit of the Party committee discussion as materials for lecturing on philosophy to the workers. Therefore, our Party committee meeting is both a study of production problems and a form of collective lesson preparation. In this way, workers' study of philosophy and production are twisted into one rope. From the leadership to the masses, they are both studying philosophy and engaging in production, which not only makes workers' study of philosophy practical and effective, but also improves the leadership's understanding level and improves leadership methods. Therefore, we believe that this is an effective method for popularizing Marxist philosophy among the working masses and promoting production development.

Studying Philosophy Is an Important Part of Putting Politics in Command

At the same time, we also realized that whether workers' study of philosophy can be closely combined with production is not just a methodological issue, but also an issue of understanding. If the relationship between workers' study of philosophy and the development of production is not clearly understood, workers' study of philosophy will not be placed in the position it deserves. One possibility is that organizing workers to study philosophy is separated from production tasks and political tasks, and is done for the sake of organizing workers to study philosophy. Doing so will not only be useless, but also harmful. Another possibility is that organizing workers to study philosophy is seen as hindering production, or as an additional thing outside of production, so they are not very enthusiastic. In addition, because they have no experience in this matter, it is easy to relax the leadership of the study due to tight production tasks, or even make the study stagnate, hurting the enthusiasm of the masses for learning. We believe that the correct understanding should be to regard organizing workers to study philosophy as an important part of putting politics in command in production, and to carry out political and ideological work at a higher level. Only in this way can we consciously unify workers' study of philosophy with production.

The above points are actually one problem, that is: workers' study of philosophy must resolutely implement the principle of starting from reality, and reality is multifaceted and constantly developing and changing, so the content of learning is also rich and infinite. Which is the most prominent problem at present, then take it as the topic of studying philosophy. Through the explanation and discussion of a problem, employees can clarify a philosophical viewpoint. During the People's Commune movement, many employees were ideologically confused and had opinions on hard work, so when carrying out socialist and communist education, we also talked about "The People's Commune is the inevitable law of historical development in our country," "The beautiful vision of communism and the current hard work are a unity of contradictions," and "Critically recognize the bourgeois legal rights ideology to correctly understand the historical role of the wage system" (look at problems from historical conditions). When studying Chairman Mao's literature "On Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers," we educated employees to look at problems from their essence. This has played a good role in improving the communist consciousness and theoretical level of employees.

With the development of learning, we feel that a prominent problem at present is how to improve workers' study of philosophy on the existing basis. Our preliminary consideration is to appropriately talk more about philosophical theory when explaining practical problems, so that everyone can know more about philosophical common sense and gradually arm the working masses with dialectical materialist philosophy.

    从生产出发　为生产服务
    组织工人学哲学的体会
    中共天津食品加工一厂委员会
    我们组织工人学习哲学是从去年6月开始的，当时参加学习班的只有二十三个人，以后逐渐发展到了一千二百多人，除了文化程度很低的以外，全厂60％的职工都积极地参加了学习，形成了一个热火朝天、猛攻哲学的学习运动。在这半年多的时间里，我们结合这一时期的政治运动，结合生产和职工思想上存在的问题，讲解了“不平衡论”、“从实际出发”、“人的主观能动作用”、“两类矛盾”等几个辩证唯物主义的观点。在进行社会主义和共产主义教育过程中，又以“人民公社化”、“为建设社会主义苦干巧干”等问题为内容，讲了些哲学理论。经过学习，大家不仅对学习哲学有了浓厚的兴趣，而且初步懂得了一些马克思主义哲学的基本知识，并能用以分析和解决许多生产和思想作风上的问题，从而大大推动了生产和技术革命的迅速发展。我厂提前在1958年国庆节以前实现了机械化，根本改变了生产的面貌。这个技术革命中的飞跃，当然是由于经过整风运动，正确处理人民内部矛盾的结果，是在上级党委领导下认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，但是它与工人学习哲学也是分不开的。工人学好哲学，就能有效地提高职工群众的共产主义觉悟和认识水平，有力地推动技术革命，促进生产的大发展。
    生产中的关键问题　就是讲哲学的课题
    组织工人学习哲学，首先必须明确学习的目的是什么。不解决这个问题，就不能很好地贯彻理论联系实际的教学方针，也不能与生产紧密结合起来。我们在开始组织工人学习的时候，虽然一般地知道工人学哲学是为了用马克思主义哲学武装工人群众的头脑，提高他们的理论、政治思想水平，但具体学习起来，领导上心中没底，学习方法也不对头，按照老一套办法跟大家讲“哲学常识”，结果工人反映说：“厂长讲了半天，说不好有点不好意思，说实话，就是听不懂，这个跟咱没关系”，“简直是瞎子点灯，白费蜡，有那个时间多学几个字不好吗？”这都是对我们领导上很尖锐的批评。在这种情况下，我们召开党委会进行了研究，明确了工人学哲学应该为生产服务，从实际出发，再用哲学武器分析解决实际问题，推动生产的发展。这个指导思想明确之后，我们立即改变了原来的作法，把生产和技术革命中的关键问题作为向工人讲哲学的课题，结果受到大家的普遍欢迎，效果良好。这就使工人的哲学学习生动活泼地发展起来。
    学了哲学长志气　手工操作变机器
    在学习中能否贯彻实际——理论——实际的教学方针，是学习成败的关键，而怎样才能有效地贯彻这一方针呢？我们觉得重要的问题在于领导上是否能够从实际中提出课题来，对这些实际问题能不能用辩证唯物主义的观点进行分析。不结合实际的空洞大道理不解决问题，只谈实际而不能上升到理论，也会使工人感到没有兴趣，达不到提高认识、推动生产的目的。在大闹技术革命，实现生产机械化的过程中，有些干部和工人只看到不利条件，百般强调困难，缺乏信心和勇气。有的说：没有工程师，连个会画图的技术员也没有，90％的工人是手工工人，机器都没有摸过；大部分人是小学文化程度和文盲，要发明机器简直是作梦。有的说：打蛋这个买卖就是手工活，资本主义国家的蛋品生产也是手工操作，等等。这些思想是搞机械化的一大障碍，不驳倒它，技术革命就不能顺利开展。针对这样的问题，就学习了“主观能动性”，使职工从理论上懂得了充分发挥人的主观能动作用，就能够改变当前生产的落后状况，消灭由于手工操作所造成的劳动强度大和患职业病的痛苦；就能战胜各种困难，变不利条件为有利条件。通过学习和辩论，大大鼓舞了职工的信心。有的说：“学了哲学长志气，手工操作变机器”。安于现状的思想被批判了，职工的思想大大解放了，立即在全厂出现了轰轰烈烈的技术革命高潮，在短短的二十天内，提出了技术革新建议四千五百多件，一千二百二十五项被采纳实现，陆续创造了六种机器，使全厂主要生产工序实现机械化的关键问题基本得到解决。
    另外，我们以五次突破生产跃进指标的实际情况向大家讲解了“平衡与不平衡”的问题。如前年我厂打蛋部日产七十五吨冰蛋，制桶部日产桶五千一百个，两者是相适应的。去年大跃进以后，打蛋生产提高了50％，制桶生产量仍保持在原来的水平上，不能满足打蛋生产的需要，产生了不平衡。经过制桶部全体职工的努力，由日产五千一百个桶提高到一万二千五百个桶，满足了打蛋生产的需要，矛盾得到解决，达到新的平衡，使整个生产向前发展了一步。平衡，不平衡，再平衡，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾，是生产向前发展的客观规律。由于大家一方面充分发挥主观能动性，一方面又尊重客观的发展规律，所以保证了生产的发展。而且从这里大家了解到平衡是暂时的、相对的，不平衡是经常的绝对的真理，懂得了分析矛盾、解决矛盾的方法。因此在研究问题的时候，都认真找起矛盾来了，说来说去发现了问题：领导上提出首先实现照蛋工序的机械化，那就需要大量造照蛋水洗联合机，可是缺乏技术人员，技术人员大部分在制桶部的焊桶组，要是把他们抽出来，就影响制桶任务的完成，这是个大矛盾。如何解决呢？例如老工人魏长庚说：这个矛盾的主要方面在焊桶组，要是把焊桶机械化了，就节省出人来了。他又提出了解决的办法，把冰蛋桶也像罐头那样用特制胶水粘。根据他的意见进行了研究和试验，终于成功了。由于这项技术革新的实现，节省了五十个技工支援制造照蛋水洗联合机，又经过七昼夜的突击，照蛋工序实现了机械化，节省了二百个劳动力。群众反映说：“学习了哲学就是办法多了”。由于职工群众发挥主观能动性和尊重客观规律的结果，使我们原计划要两年才能完成的生产机械化的任务，在1958年国庆节以前全部实现了。
    既是研究生产问题　也是进行集体备课
    把工人学习哲学与完成生产任务有机地结合起来，根据生产的实际需要来学理论，又使理论直接服务于生产。这样，工人学哲学不但与完成生产任务无矛盾，而且可以有力地推动生产任务的完成。我们所讲的哲学题目，都是通过研究生产提出来的。党委会在研究生产和技术革命中的问题时，就自觉地用哲学观点进行分析，通过集体讨论，提出关键问题，以及解决的办法和意见，然后责成专人根据党委会讨论的精神，再加以整理，作为向工人讲哲学课的材料。所以我们开党委会既是研究生产问题，也是集体备课的一种形式。这样，把工人学哲学与生产拧成一股绳，从领导到群众既是学哲学，又是搞生产，不但使工人学哲学进行得切实有效，同时也提高了领导的认识水平，改进了领导方法。因此我们认为这是在工人群众中普及马克思主义哲学、推动生产发展的一个行之有效的方法。
    学哲学是政治挂帅的一个重要内容
    同时，我们还体会到，是否能够把工人学哲学和生产紧密相结合，不只是个方法问题，而且是个认识问题。对工人学哲学与发展生产的关系认识不清，就不会把工人学哲学放在应有的地位。一种可能是，脱离生产任务和政治任务、为组织工人学哲学而组织工人学哲学，这样做就会不但无益，而且有害。另一种可能是，把组织工人学哲学这件事，看作是妨碍生产的，或是把它当作生产以外的附加的事情，因此就不大热心，再加上对这件事没有经验，就很容易因生产任务紧而放松对学习的领导，甚至使学习停顿下来，伤害群众学习的积极性。我们认为，正确的认识，应该是把组织工人学哲学这件事看作是生产中政治挂帅的一个重要内容，是在更高的水平上进行政治思想工作，这样才能自觉地使工人学哲学与生产统一起来。
    以上几条，其实是一个问题，就是：工人学哲学必须坚决贯彻从实际出发的原则，而实际是多方面的，并且是不断发展变化的，所以学习的内容也是丰富无穷的。哪是当前最突出的问题，就把它作为学哲学的课题。通过一个问题的讲解和讨论，使职工明确一个哲学观点。在人民公社化运动中，许多职工思想混乱，对苦战有意见，因此我们在进行社会主义和共产主义教育的时候，又讲了“人民公社化是我国历史发展的必然规律”，“共产主义的美好远景和当前的苦战是矛盾的统一”，“批判资产阶级法权思想正确认识工资制的历史作用”（从历史条件上看问题）。在学习毛主席“论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文献时，教育职工从本质上看问题。这对提高职工的共产主义觉悟和理论水平，都起了很好的作用。
    随着学习的发展，我们感觉目前一个突出的问题，是如何把工人学哲学在现有的基础上提高一步。我们初步考虑，在讲解实际问题的时候，适当的多讲一些哲学理论，以便使大家多知道些哲学常识，逐步地用辩证唯物主义哲学来武装工人群众。
