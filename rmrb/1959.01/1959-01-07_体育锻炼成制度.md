    Yunnan Minority Nationalities Love Sports
    Physical Exercise Becomes a System
    Under the care and leadership of the Party branch, the Yi people of Mayou Township, Hongguang Commune, Dayao County, Yunnan Province, actively participate in physical exercise.
    A total of 174 Yi commune members participate in the exercise. Every day at the first crow of the rooster, they get up and go to Yingpan Mountain for running exercises. After running 2,500 meters, they go to the field to carry out various activities. Some throw grenades, some do high jump and long jump, some do parallel bars, and some climb ropes. The whole field is extremely active. Daily exercise has become a regular system.
    In the past, there were no sports activities here. In 1958, under the care and leadership of the Party, everyone understood the benefits of labor defense system exercises, and enthusiastically threw themselves into exercise activities. If there were no basketball hoops, they would get iron and make them themselves; if there were no ropes, they would get hemp and twist them themselves. Luo Wubao, who is fifty years old, is even more enthusiastic and personally chopped twenty-four wooden grenades for everyone to use. Everyone spent three days building four sports fields, each one hundred meters long and wide. This is how they developed sports activities.
    "Things that have never been seen in thousands of years are now seen." This is what the Yi compatriots often say since the development of sports activities here.

    云南少数民族热爱体育运动
    体育锻炼成制度
    云南大姚县红光公社马游乡彝族社员，在党支部的关怀和领导下，积极参加体育锻炼。
    参加锻炼的共有一百七十四个彝族社员。每天鸡一叫，他们就起来到营盘山作跑步锻炼。跑完二千五百公尺之后，又到场子上来进行各种活动。这时有的投手榴弹，有的跳高、跳远，有的翻杠，有的爬绳，整个场子异常活跃。每天锻炼已成了经常制度。
    过去，这里是没有体育活动的，1958年大家在党的关怀和领导下，懂得了劳卫制锻炼的好处，便热情地投入了锻炼活动。没有篮圈就自己拿铁出来打，没有绳索就自己拿麻出来搓。五十岁的罗五保，更加热心，亲自动手砍了二十四个木手榴弹供大家用。大家用三天的时间修起了四个长阔一百公尺的运动场。他们就这样把体育活动开展起来了。
    “千百年没有见过的事，现在看到了。”这是这里体育活动开展起来以后，彝族同胞常常挂嘴上的话。
