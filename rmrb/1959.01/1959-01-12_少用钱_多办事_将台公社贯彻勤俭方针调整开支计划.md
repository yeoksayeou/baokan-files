According to the Hubei Daily, the Jiangtai People's Commune Party Committee in Jiangling County, on the basis of in-depth inspection and enhanced understanding, has adopted concrete measures, established various systems, and conscientiously implemented the policy of running the commune thriftily.

Since the establishment of the Jiangtai Commune, it has made great achievements in industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings, in developing welfare programs and caring for the lives of the masses, demonstrating the superiority of the People's Commune. However, in order to better allocate the fruits of labor, using the least amount of money to accomplish more, the Commune Party Committee has actively adopted measures to conscientiously implement the policy of running the commune thriftily. First, improve the financial system. It was decided that the power to control and approve productive and non-productive expenditures would be delegated to leaders at all levels. Second, welfare facilities and construction undertakings should be comprehensively arranged, uniformly planned, and implemented according to their specific conditions, prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency, and acting within their means. Directional projects should be gradually realized according to need and feasibility, preventing the pursuit of grand scale and completeness regardless of conditions. In accordance with this spirit, the Commune Party Committee decided to temporarily postpone the construction of a large auditorium, delay the purchase of film projectors, change the cultural troupes of the brigades into clubs, reduce non-productive personnel, and appropriately adjust and reduce the number of full-time cadres and service personnel in the brigades. Third, integrate the enthusiasm of all departments under the unified leadership of the Party Committee. All departments should actively perform their duties in accordance with the Party Committee's comprehensive arrangements, unified plans, and the spirit of comprehensive leaps forward. At the same time, they must unswervingly serve the central tasks and support the central tasks, preventing the dispersion of forces. Economic expenditures should first satisfy the needs of production and appropriately improve the lives of the masses, while also taking into account the needs of other work. Fourth, deeply publicize the nature and various policies of the People's Commune, clarify thinking, unify understanding, and mobilize the labor enthusiasm of all commune members. On this basis, deeply implement the policy of running the commune thriftily and running all undertakings thriftily, promoting hard work and plain living, and opposing extravagance and waste. In accordance with the spirit of running the commune thriftily, the Commune Party Committee has re-adjusted the expenditure plan and labor force arrangement, and actively organized a group of labor forces to engage in diversified operations to increase income and prepare sufficient production funds for 1959.

The Commune Party Committee is holding a general meeting of all Party members to deploy the rectification of the commune and formulate the production plan for 1959, and to specifically implement the policy of running the commune thriftily into the rectification of the commune and production planning.
