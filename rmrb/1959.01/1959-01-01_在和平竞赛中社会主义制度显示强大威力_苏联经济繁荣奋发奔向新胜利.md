Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: This reporter reports: In 1958, the economies of the Soviet Union and the United States presented two distinctly different pictures in peaceful competition. In the year that is about to pass, the Soviet national economy continued to prosper and advance, with industrial production, according to preliminary estimates, increasing by 10%. The United States, however, was under the heavy blow of an economic crisis, with industrial production dropping by about 7%. Before the October Revolution, the industrial production of the United States was nearly fifteen times that of Tsarist Russia. By the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution—1957—American industrial production was only about twice as high as that of the Soviet Union. After just one year of peaceful competition, the total industrial output of the United States and the Soviet Union is now in the ratio of approximately 1.8 to 1. "The Russians are catching up with us, not only because they are moving forward, but also because we are declining"—even former U.S. President Truman had to admit this fact gloomily.

However, what shocked and saddened the United States most in the past year was the event that occurred on November 14th. On this day, the Soviet Union published Comrade Khrushchev's report outline on the Seven-Year Plan. In this report, the Soviet leaders declared to the world with great pride that the peaceful economic competition between the Soviet Union and all the most developed capitalist countries, including the United States, had now "entered a decisive stage." In a very short historical period, the great Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass them both in total production and in per capita output.

Even before World War II, the Soviet Union had surpassed all European capitalist countries in terms of total industrial production, second only to the United States and ranking second in the world. If it were not for the severe damage to the Soviet economy caused by the war, the Soviet Union could have reached the current level of the United States in total industrial output by the end of 1960, based on the current rate of development. Now, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the Soviet Union's total industrial output will increase by about 80% in seven years, and agriculture by about 70%. Based on the current comparison of the total industrial and agricultural output of the Soviet Union and the United States, this means that by 1965, the Soviet Union will reach the current level of the United States in total industrial output, and surpass the current level of the United States in the total output and per capita output of important agricultural products. The Seven-Year Plan and the materials recently published in the Soviet press indicate that by around 1968 and 1970, the Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass the United States at that time in terms of total industrial output and per capita output, respectively. In the 1880s, the emerging United States once overwhelmed Britain and France and began to become the world's largest industrial country, holding sway for decades. However, now, the "leading position" of the United States is about to disappear in the face of the Soviet giant's footsteps.

The Soviet Union is far richer in natural resources than the United States, and its level of national education and some of the most important scientific and technological sectors are also far ahead. At present, Soviet universities train almost twice as many engineers as the United States, and the number of engineers with diplomas working in various sectors of the national economy is almost twice as many as in the United States. These are the superior conditions for the Soviet Union to defeat the United States in peaceful economic competition. And the superiority of the socialist system and the advantage of the speed of Soviet economic development are the fundamental conditions that determine the outcome.

During the period 1918-1957, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial production was more than 3.1 times that of the United States. According to the Seven-Year Plan, in the next seven years, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial production will reach about 8.6%; and according to Soviet economic experts, the actual rate will not be lower than 10% (it has increased by 10% to 11% every year in the past few years). If the industrial production of the United States increases at all during the same period, it is estimated that it will not be very large. According to estimates by the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, due to the impact of the current economic crisis and other factors, the average annual increase in U.S. industrial production during the period 1959-1965 will only be about 1.6% to 2.2%. This is even slower than its past development speed. For example, in the thirteen years after the war, the average annual growth of U.S. industrial production was 2.5%. Commenting on the prospects of the Soviet-U.S. economic competition, the famous American bourgeois commentator Lippmann recently wrote with concern: "The Communists will win this race unless we rapidly surpass the current level of productivity." It seems that his concerns will certainly be proven by facts.

The peaceful economic competition between the Soviet Union and the most developed capitalist countries has entered a new stage. The characteristics of this stage are: Soviet industry is not only developing at a very high speed, but also, in general, the absolute increase is even higher. For example, during the period 1953-1958, the increase in production of the entire Soviet industry was almost three times that of the United States. Moreover, in the annual absolute increase in iron ore, pig iron, steel, coal, oil, cement, wool fabrics, and some important machines, the Soviet Union also surpassed the United States. For example, during the period 1953-1957, the average annual increase in Soviet steel production was 3.2 million tons, coal increased by 30.6 million tons, and oil increased by 11.4 million tons; while the average annual growth of the United States during the same period was: steel - 300,000 tons, coal - 5.7 million tons, oil - 8.8 million tons.

During the future Seven-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union's advantage over the United States will be strengthened, thereby further accelerating the change in the balance of economic power between the two countries.

According to materials published by the Soviet "Red Star" on December 2nd, if the total industrial output of the Soviet Union this year is taken as 1, then the change in the comparison of industrial production between the Soviet Union and the United States in the next twelve years will be roughly as shown in the following table:

        1958	1959	1960	1961	1962	1963	1964
Soviet Union	1	1.1	1.2	1.3	1.4	1.5	1.6
United States	1.8	1.8	1.9	1.9	1.9	2.0	2.0

        1965	1966	1967	1968	1969	1970
Soviet Union	1.8	1.9	2.1	2.3	2.5	2.7
United States	2.1	2.1	2.2	2.2	2.3	2.3

The above materials clearly foreshadow the process and prospects of the peaceful economic competition between the Soviet Union and the United States in the next ten years. From here, people can see the Soviet people striding forward towards communism, and hear the prelude to the triumphant song of defeating the United States.

### 在和平竞赛中社会主义制度显示强大威力  苏联经济繁荣奋发奔向新胜利

    在和平竞赛中社会主义制度显示强大威力
    苏联经济繁荣奋发奔向新胜利
    新华社30日讯　本社记者报道：1958年苏联和美国的经济在和平竞赛中呈现出了两种截然不同的景象。在即将逝去的一年中，苏联国民经济继续繁荣奋发，工业生产据初步估计增加了10％。而美国却处在经济危机的沉重打击下，工业生产下降了约7％。在十月革命以前，美国的工业生产曾经为沙俄的将近十五倍。而到十月革命四十周年——1957年的时候，美国工业生产只比苏联高大约一倍。经过仅仅一年的和平竞赛，目前美苏的工业总产量已经成为大约一点八与一之比。“俄国人正在赶上我们，这不仅因为他们正在前进，而且也因为我们正在衰退”——就连美国前总统杜鲁门也不得不黯然地承认这一事实。
    然而，在即将过去的一年里，最使美国震惊和忧伤的，要算11月14日发生的事件了。这一天，苏联公布了赫鲁晓夫同志关于七年计划的报告提纲，苏联领导人在这个报告中豪迈地向全世界宣称：苏联同包括美国在内的一切最发达的资本主义国家之间的和平经济竞赛现在已“进入了决定性的阶段”。在极短的历史时期内，伟大的苏联将既在生产总量上、又在按人口平均计算的产量上赶上和超过它们。
    还在第二次世界大战以前，苏联就在工业生产总量方面超过欧洲所有资本主义国家，仅次于美国，而居世界第二位。如果不是大战对苏联经济的严重破坏，按目前的速度发展，苏联本可以在1960年年底在工业总产量上达到美国目前的水平。现在七年计划规定，苏联工业总产量在七年中要增加约80％，农业要增加约70％。根据目前苏美两国工农业总产量的对比，这意味着，到1965年，苏联就将在工业总产量上达到目前美国的水平，在重要农产品的总产量和按人口计算的产量上压倒目前美国的水平。七年计划和最近苏联报刊发表的材料表明，到1968年和1970年前后，苏联就将分别在工业总产量和按人口计算的产量上赶上和超过当时的美国。在十九世纪八十年代，新兴的美国曾经压倒了英国和法国，开始成为世界上最大的工业国，几十年来，不可一世。可是，在现在，美国的“领先地位”在苏联巨人的脚步面前快要消失了。
    苏联的自然资源远远富于美国，在国民教育和一些最重要的科学技术部门方面的水平也遥遥领先。目前，苏联各高等学校培养的工程师几乎比美国多两倍，在国民经济各部门中执有文凭的工程师差不多比美国多一倍。这些都是和平经济竞赛中，苏联战胜美国的优越条件。而社会主义制度的优越性和苏联经济发展速度的优势，更是决定胜负的根本条件。
    在1918—1957年期间，苏联工业生产每年平均增长速度等于美国的三点一倍以上。根据七年计划，在今后七年间，苏联工业生产每年平均增长速度将达大约8.6％；而据苏联经济专家估计，实际上达到的速度将不会低于10％（过去几年每年就增加10％到11％）。美国的工业生产在同一时期如果有所增加的话，估计也不会很大。据苏联科学院世界经济和国际关系研究所估计，由于目前经济危机的影响和他其因素，在1959—1965年期间，美国工业生产每年平均只会增加大约1.6％到2.2％。这还慢于它过去时期的发展速度，例如，在战后十三年中，美国工业生产每年平均增长2.5％。在评论苏美经济竞赛的前景时，美国著名资产阶级评论员李普曼最近忧心忡忡地写道：“共产党人将会在这次竞赛中取得胜利，除非我们使生产率迅速超过现在的水平”。看来，他的担心肯定将为事实所证明。
    苏联同最发达的资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛已经进入了新的阶段。这个阶段的特点是：苏联工业不仅发展速度很高，而且总的说来，绝对增长量也更高了。例如，在1953—1958年间，苏联整个工业的增产额就将近等于美国的三倍。而且，在铁矿砂、生铁、钢、煤、石油、水泥、毛织品和一些重要的机器的每年绝对增产量上，苏联也超过了美国。例如，在1953—1957年期间，苏联的钢产量每年平均增加三百二十万吨，煤增加三千零六十万吨，石油增加一千一百四十万吨；而美国在同时期每年平均增长的情况是：钢——三十万吨，煤——五百七十万吨，石油——八百八十万吨。
    在未来的七年计划期间，苏联对美国的这一优势还将加强，从而更加加快两国经济力量对比的变化。
    据苏联“红星报”12月2日发表的材料，如果以今年苏联工业总产量为一，那么，今后十二年间苏美两国工业生产对比的变化大致将如下表：
      1958　1959　1960　1961　1962　1963　1964苏联 　1　  1.1　 1.2　 1.3　 1.4　 1.5 　1.6美国　 1.8　1.8　 1.9　 1.9　 1.9　 2.0　 2.0
      1965　1966　1967　1968　1969　1970苏联　 1.8　1.9　 2.1　 2.3 　2.5　 2.7美国　 2.1　2.1　 2.2 　2.2　 2.3　 2.3
    以上材料清楚地预示了今后十多年内苏美两国和平经济竞赛的进程和前景。从这里，人们可以看到苏联人民昂首阔步向共产主义快速前进的步伐，听到战胜美国的凯歌的前奏。
