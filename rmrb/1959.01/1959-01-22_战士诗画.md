Soldier Poetry and Paintings
    If Your Enthusiasm is High
    If your enthusiasm is high,
    You won't fear even Mount Tai.
    If your enthusiasm is low,
    Even a brick will trip you.
        (Yang Zhanxing)
    The Target
    Wearing a green uniform,
    Face full of pockmarks.
    Don't underestimate the pockmarks,
    Beautiful and magnificent.
    If I had fewer pockmarks,
    The marksman would frown,
    If I had more pockmarks,
    Everyone would be happy.
      (Li Fengliang)
    Becoming a Liberation Army Soldier
    Wearing a green uniform,
    Neat, clean and fitting.
    Swinging my arms as I walk, full of vigor,
    Walking lightly as clouds.
    The landlady squints and smiles,
    Asking why I'm so excited?
    Because I put on the new uniform,
    And became a Liberation Army soldier.
    (Song Renzhen, Teng Jianxing)
    Sewing
    Winter is cold, the north wind is fierce,
    The squad leader is off duty, the moon is in the west.
    Holding needle and thread, sitting under the lamp,
    Quietly sewing a cotton coat for me.
    Stitch by stitch, closely sewn,
    Kindness sewn into my heart.
      (Fu Weishun)
    He is Our Instructor
    It's already twelve o'clock at night,
    Someone is still wandering in the dormitory,
    Tucking in the blankets on each bed,
    He is our instructor.
        (Jia Hongtai)
    Not Begging Heaven for Mercy
    Carrying loads upwards,
    Pouring ladles downwards,
    Soldiers and civilians fight the drought,
    Not begging heaven for mercy!
       (Yi Jun)
    A Row of Sweat, a Ditch Flows
    A row of sweat, a ditch flows,
    Clear river water flows in the ditch.
    Row upon row has our sweat,
    Flow upon flow has our strength.
    Sweat blooms in the fields,
    Strength grows in the fields.
    Those bountiful wheat ears,
    Are the reward for the soldiers.
       (Zhang Yunhai)
    Hometown
    My home is in Henan,
    A letter from home says:
    My hometown is planting rice,
    Dry land has become paddy fields,
    Everyone raises the slogan,
    Transform Henan into Jiangnan in three years.
    Add oil to learning,
    Be proficient in both literary and military skills,
    Return to my hometown after completing my service,
    Strive to be a good commune member.
          (Zhang Shilin)

    战士诗画
    如果你的干劲大
    如果你的干劲大，
    见了泰山也不怕。
    如果你的干劲小，
    见块砖头也绊倒。
        （杨占兴）
    靶
    身披绿衣衫，
    满脸是麻斑。
    别看麻子多，
    美丽又壮观。
    我若麻子少，
    射手脸难看，
    我若麻子多，
    人人心喜欢。
      （李风良）
    当了解放军
    绿色军装身上穿，
    整齐清洁又合身。
    甩手走路多带劲，
    步行如轻云。
    房东大娘眯眼笑，
    问我为啥这样兴奋？
    因我穿上新军装，
    当上了解放军。
    （宋仁振、滕建兴）
    缝衣
    冬天冷，北风急，
    班长下岗月儿西。
    手拿针线灯下坐，
    悄悄为我缝棉衣。
    针针线线密密缝，
    情意缝在我心里。
      （傅维顺）
    他是我们指导员
    已是夜深十二点，
    有人还在宿舍转，
    挨个床铺把被盖，
    他是我们指导员。
        （贾洪太）
    不向天求饶
    担担往上挑，
    瓢瓢往下浇，
    军民来抗旱，
    不向天求饶！
       （艺军）
    汗一行沟一趟
    汗一行，沟一趟，
    清清河水沟里淌。
    行行有我们的汗珠，
    趟趟有我们的力量。
    汗珠在地里开花，
    力量在地里成长。
    那丰收的麦穗，
    就是对战士的褒奖。
       （张云海）
    家乡
    我家在河南，
    家里来信谈：
    家乡种水稻，
    旱地变水田，
    大家提口号，
    三年变江南。
    加油来学习，
    文武要双全，
    服役期满还家乡，
    争取当个好社员。
          （张士林）
