    Culture and Production
    Ai Bei
    Socialist cultural work should be combined with production and serve production. Our cultural work has always implemented this policy, so it has both promoted the development of production and developed itself.
    Some comrades are wholeheartedly devoted to production, hoping to make it even better. This sense of responsibility for socialist construction is very valuable. However, because they only focus on production and do not see the connection between production and cultural work, nor the promoting role of cultural work in production, they only fear that cultural activities will affect production and have a deterrent effect on production. What are the results? In these places, cultural work is of course not easy to do well; but what about production? Due to the lack of cultural work, it cannot achieve the best results.
    So, can we think that unlimitedly increasing cultural activities is also beneficial to production? Of course not. Today, our production level and production technology are still very low, and the main time of workers has to be spent on production. If cultural work or other non-directly productive work takes up too much time, it will affect production.
    There is no doubt that the cultural life of our 600 million people will become richer and richer. We will spend more and more time on cultural activities to build our socialist culture. However, culture is a reflection of the economy in the form of ideology, and it serves the economic base. Therefore, culture and the economic base should maintain a corresponding relationship in order to promote each other. In a communist society, when the social economy has greatly developed and the means of subsistence are greatly enriched, people will be able to shorten working hours, for example, spending six hours a day, or even less, on productive labor for economic construction. Then, relatively, they will have more time to engage in cultural activities and build a communist culture. However, today, we are carrying out socialist construction. Although our material life has improved, it is still far from the goal of greatly enriched means of subsistence. We must make the greatest efforts to build the socialist economic base and depict the blueprint of communism. We can only carry out cultural activities appropriately in conjunction with production under the condition of serving production. Only when the socialist economic base becomes more and more solid can cultural undertakings achieve greater and greater development.
    Cultural work must serve production; affecting production goes against its purpose. However, that kind of "being afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind," fearing affecting production, and unnecessarily relaxing cultural work, ultimately affecting production from one's own negative factors, is also not a scientific attitude towards cultural work. How to correctly arrange cultural work to serve production and promote each other, so as to achieve "just the right amount," is an important issue that leaders of cultural work departments at all levels need to pay attention to. There are really many successful experiences in the double leap forward of production and culture in various places, and it is necessary to summarize them. We should distinguish the boundaries between realistic possibilities and unrealistic possibilities, adopt a positive attitude, so that cultural work can obtain corresponding development and improvement on the basis of a greater leap forward in production.

    文化和生产
    艾北
    社会主义的文化工作要同生产结合，并且为生产服务。我们的文化工作是一向执行这个方针的，所以既推动了生产的发展，也使本身得到了发展。
    有些同志，他们专心致志于生产，希望把生产搞得锦上添花，这种社会主义建设的责任感，是非常宝贵的。可是，因为他们只专注于生产，而看不到生产同文化工作的联系，看不到文化工作对生产的促进作用，只怕文化活动会影响生产，对生产起促退作用。结果呢？在这些地方，文化工作当然不易搞好；可是，生产呢？由于缺乏文化工作，也不能达到最好的要求。
    那么，可不可以认为无限制地增加文化活动，也有利于生产呢？当然不能这样说。今天我们的生产水平和生产技术都还很低，劳动者的主要时间还得用到生产上去，文化工作或者其它非直接生产的工作，如果占了过多的时间，都会影响生产。
    毫无疑问，我们六亿人民的文化生活是要越来越丰富的。我们将要以越来越多的时间来从事文化活动，来建设我们社会主义的文化。但是，文化是在观念形态上反映经济的东西，是为经济基础服务的。因此，文化同经济基础应该保持相适应的关系，才能互相促进。到了共产主义社会，社会经济大大发展了，生活资料大大丰富了，人们就有可能缩短劳动时间，比如说，一天用六小时，或者甚至更短的时间来进行生产劳动，从事经济建设，那末，相对地，就有更多的时间来从事文化活动，建设共产主义的文化。可是，在今天来说，我们正在进行社会主义建设，我们的物质生活虽然有改进，但是距离生活资料大大丰富的目的还很远。我们必须以最大的努力来建设社会主义的经济基础，描摹共产主义的蓝图。我们只能在服从生产的条件下，结合生产适当地进行文化活动。只有社会主义的经济基础越打越稳固，文化事业才能获得愈来愈大的发展。
    文化工作要为生产服务，影响生产就走向了它的目的的反面。但是，那种“前怕狼，后怕虎”，怕影响生产，而不必要地放松了文化工作，结果却从自己的消极因素这一面来影响了生产，那也不是对待文化工作的科学态度。如何正确安排文化工作为生产服务，互相促进，从而“恰到好处”，这是各级文化工作部门的领导者需要注意的一个重要问题。各地生产文化双跃进的成功经验，真是很多，有必要来总结一下了。我们应该区别现实的可能性和非现实的可能性的界限，采取积极的态度，使文化工作能够在生产更大跃进的基础上，获得相应的发展和提高。
