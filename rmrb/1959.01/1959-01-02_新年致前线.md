New Year's Greetings to the Front Lines
    Tián Hàn

    The New Year has arrived. I, here in the capital, extend my greetings to you – the heroic soldiers and civilians fighting on the Fujian coastal defense front.
    First, we think of the artillery comrades defending the very front lines of the coast. Your "Heroic Positions" must be adorned with many bright and dazzling decorations like Spring Festival couplets, slogans, flowers, and freshly cut branches. The walls of your gun emplacements must be covered with countless new poems. The heroic sons and daughters of the nearby villages, fighting alongside you, must be gathering at your gun emplacements to sing and dance for you. You have likely received many warm letters of greeting and New Year's wishes from your hometowns, from the capital, and from various provinces and cities, warming your hearts as much as a freshly fired cannon.
    The same must be true at the bases of our heroic Air Force and Navy. Our Air Force fighters, who call the runway home, and the naval officers and soldiers active on ships – how did you spend New Year's Eve? You must be both disciplined and at ease. The people's soldiers, armed with Marxism-Leninism and the guidance of Mao Zedong, are fearless revolutionary optimists, but we have always treated national enemies and class enemies with a hundredfold vigilance, not allowing any of their conspiracies to succeed, any of their provocations to go unpunished! We "stand ready" to defend our national construction and strike at the enemies of peace and progress. Our ammunition and torpedoes are always highly, rapidly, and accurately projected onto the enemy's head. We never slacken or become careless at any time.
    Those wounded soldiers like Comrade Hu Dean, who are lying in the rear hospitals, must have recovered considerably as the New Year arrives. This is inseparable from the efforts of the doctors and nurses who have dedicated themselves to the patients, inspired by the spirit of the heroes. We wish them a speedy recovery, so that they can rejoin the cause of socialist construction and defense as soon as possible.
    Our militiamen, who have mastered sophisticated weapons, are welcoming the great New Year with such joyful hearts! When we did not have regular weapons, we already did so much and so well for the troops, dealing such powerful blows to the enemy. Now we carry guns, and some are all-around marksmen proficient in various weapons. We create our own happy lives and are also the heroic defenders of those happy lives; we forge our own destiny and become the wise and powerful masters of our own destiny.
    You are not only undertaking the current struggle against the enemy, but you are also exerting tremendous energy in production and labor. I have admired your tangerines yielding ten thousand catties per mu, and your infinitely sweet bananas, pomelos, pineapples, and sugarcane. I have drunk the milk you have processed, filling vats and pools. I have visited your factories, villages, and various mass steelmaking and ironmaking activities. You are developing the amazingly rich treasures step by step; some of you have created something from nothing, and some have made things even better. After the completion of the huge water conservancy project, the power supply will exceed Fujian's own needs. At that time, Fujian's appearance will be incomparable to today, and its contribution to the country will be enormous. When our steel production reaches over 100 million tons, and all other construction surges forward, we will be greatly improved, and the enemy will quickly rot away, making the liberation of Taiwan an easy problem to solve.
    However, we must intensify our efforts. Our leaping 1958 has enabled us to achieve great successes in industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction. But even greater leap forward years are yet to come. This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China, and we must offer even newer and more beautiful achievements to the Party and the people in all aspects. This means that even more arduous and glorious labor awaits us.
    Comrades, the revolutionary heroism and communist style you have shown in battle have had a great impact on the people of the whole country. Let us continue to greet the great new victories of 1959 with intense political enthusiasm, soaring energy, and a scientific spirit. I wish you a Happy New Year!

                                            New Year's Day, 1959

    新年致前线
    田汉
    新年到了。我在首都向你们——战斗在福建海防前线的英雄军民们祝贺。
    首先我们想到防守在海防最前线的炮兵同志们，你们的“英雄阵地”上该用春联、标语、鲜花、生枝添上了许多明艳夺目的装饰吧；那炮床的墙壁上该又贴上了无数的新诗吧；跟你们一道战斗的附近村庄的英雄儿女们一定集聚在你们的炮床为你们歌唱起舞吧。你们也可能接到许多从你们家乡来的，首都和各省市来的热情的慰问信贺年信使你们的心跟刚发射过的炮腔一样地温暖吧。
    这同样的情况一定也发生在我们英雄的空军、海军的驻地。以跑道为家的我们的空军战士，和活跃在舰艇上的海军将士们，你们是怎样度过大除夕的呢？你们一定是又严整又舒畅。以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东的指导武装着的人民战士是无所畏惧的革命的乐观主义者，但我们从来又是以百倍的警惕对待民族敌人、阶级敌人，不许他们的任何阴谋得逞，任何蠢动不受惩罚！我们为保卫祖国建设、打击和平进步敌人而“枕戈待旦”。我们弹药和鱼雷总是高度的迅速和准确投射在敌人头上的。任何时候我们也不懈怠大意。
    那些躺在后方医院的像胡德安同志一样的负伤将士们在新年到来的时候该已经恢复得差不多了吧。这是与那些在英雄们的精神感染下为病人献身的医生护士们的努力分不开的。我们祝福他们早日痊快，早日重复参加社会主义建设事业，保卫事业。
    我们掌握了精锐武器的民兵们更是以怎样欢跃的心情迎接伟大的新年哟！我们在没有正规武器的时候已经给部队工作得那样多、那样好，给过敌人那样有力的打击。如今我们背上了枪，有的还是各种武器的全能射手。我们创造自己的幸福生活，也是幸福生活的英勇的捍卫者，我们开拓自己的运命也成为自己运命的英明强大的主人。
    你们不止担当了当前对敌斗争，你们在生产劳动方面也发挥了十足的冲天干劲。我欣赏过你们亩产万斤的芦柑和无限甜美的香蕉、柚子、凤梨、甘蔗。我喝过你们加工的成桶成池的牛奶。参观过你们的工厂、农村和各种炼钢炼铁的群众活动。你们一步步开发丰富得惊人的宝藏，你们有些已经从无到有，有些从有到十分美好。在巨大的水利工程完成以后，电力供给将超过福建本身的需要，到了那时候，福建的面目将非今天可比，对全国的贡献将十分巨大。在我们钢产量达到一亿吨以上，其他一切建设跟着突飞猛进的时候，我们将大大地好起来，敌人得迅速地烂下去，台湾解放问题将不难解决。
    但是，我们还得加紧努力。我们飞跃的一九五八年使我们在工农业生产以及国防建设方面取得极大的成就。但是更大的跃进年还在今后。今年是我们伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年，我们要在各方面都以更新更美的成就向党向人民献礼，这就是说，更艰巨也更光荣的劳动在等待着我们。 　 同志们，你们在战斗中所表现的革命的英雄主义和共产主义风格给了全国人民极大的影响。我们继续以强烈的政治热情，冲天干劲和科学精神，来迎接伟大一九五九年新的胜利吧。祝新年好！
                                            一九五九年元旦
