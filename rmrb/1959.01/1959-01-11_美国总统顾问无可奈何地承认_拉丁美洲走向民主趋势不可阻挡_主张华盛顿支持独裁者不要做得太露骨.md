Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th. News: The collapse of the Cuban dictatorial regime, which was supported by the United States, has caused a great reaction among some political figures in the United States. According to an Associated Press report from Washington on the 3rd, U.S. Presidential Advisor Milton Eisenhower recently wrote a 10,000-word report to the U.S. President, requesting the United States to "revise its policies towards dictators." In this report, Milton Eisenhower reluctantly admitted that "throughout Latin America, there is a strong and unstoppable trend towards freedom and democracy."

Milton Eisenhower said, "We have made some real mistakes in our dealings with dictators." However, according to the Associated Press report, his so-called suggestion to the United States to revise its policies towards dictators is only a request to maintain a seemingly distant but actually close relationship with some dictators, just as in the past. The Associated Press said that this report requires the United States not to "give special attention" to dictators, but at the same time, it also said that the United States should not stop cooperating with dictators. Milton Eisenhower believes that stopping this cooperation would "paralyze all (American) foreign relations activities."

The drafter of the report also admitted that Latin American countries are expressing increasing dissatisfaction with U.S. policy. However, Milton Eisenhower deliberately downplayed this dissatisfaction as a "misunderstanding" and insisted that Latin American countries' disagreement with the U.S.'s unilateral setting of raw material prices was a "serious misconception."

    美国总统顾问无可奈何地承认
    拉丁美洲走向民主趋势不可阻挡
    主张华盛顿支持独裁者不要做得太露骨
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：得到美国支持的古巴独裁政权的垮台，在美国一些政界人士中引起巨大反响。据美联社3日自华盛顿报道，美国总统顾问密尔顿·艾森豪威尔曾经在最近给美国总统写了一篇长达一万字的报告，这份报告要求美国“修改它对独裁者们的政策”。密尔顿·艾森豪威尔在这份报告中无可奈何地承认，“在整个拉丁美洲，存在着一种强烈而不可阻挡的走向自由和民主的趋势。”
    密尔顿·艾森豪威尔说，“我们在和独裁者们的交往中犯了一些实实在在的错误”。但是，根据美联社的报道，他提出的所谓要美国修改对独裁者们的政策的建议，只是要求对一些独裁者保持一种表面上看来是疏远，而实际上仍旧保持像过去那样的亲密关系。美联社说，这份报告要美国不要对独裁者“给予特别的重视”，但他同时又说，美国不应停止同独裁者的合作。密尔顿·艾森豪威尔认为，如果停止这种合作那就“会使得（美国的）全部对外关系的活动陷于瘫痪。”
    报告的起草人还承认，拉丁美洲国家对美国的政策表示出越来越多的不满。但是，密尔顿·艾森豪威尔却故意把这种不满轻描淡写地说成是一种“误解”，并且把拉丁美洲国家不同意美国单方面规定原料的价格硬说成是一个“严重的错误看法”。
