Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 6th: The National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives of Korea continued its session today. Many representatives discussed the first item on the agenda (regarding the victory of socialist agricultural cooperativization in Korea and the future development of agriculture) at today's meeting. The heads of the Soviet and Chinese agricultural delegations delivered congratulatory speeches at the morning session today.

    Petrov, head of the Soviet agricultural delegation and Deputy Minister of Agriculture, extended heartfelt and warm congratulations to the congress. He said that he had listened with great interest to the report made by Premier Kim Il-sung to the congress.

    Petrov praised the heroic labor of the Korean people. He said that they were very pleased that your motherland had risen from the ruins and that you had embarked on the road of socialism. He wished the congress success.

    Liao Luyan, head of the Chinese agricultural delegation and Minister of Agriculture, extended warm congratulations to the congress and all Korean farmers on behalf of China's 500 million farmers in his congratulatory speech. He said that the Chinese agricultural delegation was extremely excited to have the opportunity to participate in this congress, which has great historical significance in the history of socialist construction in Korea and in the history of agricultural development in Korea.

    Liao Luyan said that the heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, have mounted the Chollima and are advancing rapidly on the road of building socialism. In 1958, while achieving great victories on the industrial production front, the Korean people victoriously completed agricultural cooperativization, significantly increased grain production, and advanced agricultural production along the path of irrigation, mechanization, and electrification. This is something that peace-loving and progressive people all over the world are cheering for. The Chinese people regard the achievements of the Korean people in building socialism as their own achievements.

    Liao Luyan said that the Chinese agricultural delegation will learn from the rich experience accumulated by Korea in agricultural production and construction at this congress, which will certainly be of great help to the further development of agricultural production in China. He wished the congress a complete success.

    When the heads of the Soviet and Chinese delegations delivered their speeches, all the delegates stood up and applauded warmly.

    Representatives who spoke at the meeting today included Yoon Gil-seon, chairman of the Twelve Three Thousand Li Agricultural Cooperative, and Li Jong-chun, chairman of the Sangyang Agricultural Cooperative. They unanimously supported the report made by Premier Kim Il-sung to the congress yesterday. Korean Minister of Agriculture Han Deok-jong emphasized the issue of planting less to harvest more and increasing the yield per unit area in his speech. He said that in terms of irrigation, the area of paddy fields irrigated should first be expanded to 700,000 jeongbo (1 jeongbo is approximately 15 Chinese mu), and the focus of irrigation should be on the plains with sufficient water sources where rice can be grown. In establishing a 300,000 jeongbo dryland irrigation system, the focus should first be on areas where wheat and cotton can be concentrated and where mechanization is facilitated. In terms of mechanization, tractors and automobiles should also be centrally distributed to the plains first. Han Deok-jong said that if 700,000 jeongbo of good land out of Korea's approximately 2 million jeongbo of cultivated land are converted into irrigation-safe fields, and the average yield per jeongbo is increased to 15 tons, then the paddy fields alone can produce more than 10 million tons of grain, which, in addition to supplying the people with food, will leave a surplus. From the 1.3 million jeongbo of dry land, 300,000 jeongbo of relatively flat and fertile land should be selected to establish an irrigation system for planting cash crops and vegetables, and the remaining land should be planted with feed crops, fruit trees, mulberry trees, etc. Soon, there will be plenty of food and clothing, so that a system of distribution according to ability and distribution according to need can be gradually established.

    中苏代表在朝鲜农业合作社大会上致词
    英雄的朝鲜人民建设英雄的人民朝鲜
    新华社平壤6日电　朝鲜全国农业合作社大会今天继续举行会议，许多代表在今天的会议上就第一项议程（关于朝鲜社会主义农业合作化的胜利和农业今后的发展问题）进行了讨论。苏联和中国的农业代表团团长在今天上午的会上致了祝词。
    苏联农业代表团团长、农业部副部长彼得罗夫向大会致以衷心的热烈的祝贺。他说，他以很大的兴趣听了金日成首相向大会作的报告。
    彼得罗夫赞扬了朝鲜人民英雄的劳动。他说，你们的祖国已经从废墟中站起来了，你们已经走上了社会主义的道路，这使我们感到非常高兴。他祝大会成功。
    中国农业代表团团长、农业部部长廖鲁言在致祝词时，代表中国的五亿农民向大会和朝鲜全体农民表示热烈的祝贺。他说，中国农业代表团有机会参加这个在朝鲜社会主义建设史上、在朝鲜的农业发展史上具有伟大历史意义的大会，感到异常的兴奋。
    廖鲁言说，英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和金日成首相领导之下，跨上了千里马，在建设社会主义的道路上飞速前进。1958年，朝鲜人民在工业生产战线上取得巨大胜利的同时，胜利地完成了农业合作化，粮食产量也有很大的增长，并且使农业生产沿着水利化、机械化、电气化的道路向前迈进。这是全世界爱好和平和进步的人民为之欢欣鼓舞的。中国人民把朝鲜人民建设社会主义的成就看成是自己的成就。
    廖鲁言说，中国农业代表团将从这次大会上学习朝鲜在农业生产建设上积累的丰富经验，这对进一步发展中国农业生产，一定会有很大的帮助。他祝大会胜利成功。
    在苏联和中国的代表团团长致词时，全体代表起立并热烈鼓掌。
    今天在会上发言的代表包括十二三千里农业社社长尹吉善、上阳农业社社长李宗淳等，他们一致拥护金日成首相昨天向大会作的报告。朝鲜农业相韩典钟在会上发言时，着重强调了少种多收、提高单位面积产量的问题。他说，在实行水利化方面，要首先把水田灌溉面积扩大到七十万町步（一町步约合十五市亩），把灌溉重点放在水源充足的可以种植水稻的平地上；在建立三十万町步旱田灌溉体系方面，要首先从可以集中种植小麦和棉花，并有利于实行机械化的地区着手；在机械化方面，也要首先把拖拉机和汽车集中分配到平原地区。韩典钟说，如果把朝鲜约二百万町步耕地中的七十万町步良田改为水利安全田，把每町步的平均产量提高到十五吨，那么，仅是水田就能生产一千万吨以上的粮食，除了供应人民的粮食外，还有余粮。从一百三十万町步的旱田中，选择较平坦肥沃的三十万町步土地，建立灌溉体系，种植经济作物和蔬菜，其它的土地种饲料作物、栽果树、桑树等。不久以后，吃的和穿的东西就都会丰富起来，从而可以逐渐建立各尽所能、按需分配的体系。
