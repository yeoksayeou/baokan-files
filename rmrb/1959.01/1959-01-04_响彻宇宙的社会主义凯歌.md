    Socialist Triumph Resounds Through the Universe

    A "red rocket" is flying towards the moon, playing a socialist paean. This is the world's first successful interplanetary cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union on January 2nd. By 10:50 PM (Beijing time) on January 3rd, the rocket had reached an altitude of 227,000 kilometers from Earth, and it is expected to reach the moon's area around 12:00 noon today. The great Soviet people have thus made an epoch-making contribution to the progressive people of the world at the beginning of 1959. As the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, said, flying to planets is something for our generation.
    The Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket towards the moon marks a new peak in Soviet science and technology, and also opens a new era for mankind to conquer outer space. For centuries, people have dreamed of riding the wind and traveling in space. The story of "Chang'e flying to the moon" has been circulating in our country, but it is just a beautiful romantic myth. Today, this bold fantasy of traveling in space is gradually becoming a reality. Mankind's lofty hope of conquering outer space is rising, rising, and rising with the Soviet cosmic rocket! On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite went into space, which was the first step for mankind to conquer outer space. Only one year and three months later, the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket went into space, which was the second step for mankind to conquer outer space. Soviet scientists and engineering technology experts have not only theoretically studied a series of important issues in interplanetary flight, but also created earth-shattering great achievements in practice. In the history of human science, Soviet scientists and engineering technology experts were the first to solve the problem of the first cosmic velocity (i.e., a speed of 8 kilometers per second), successfully launched artificial Earth satellites, and then successfully solved the problem of the second cosmic velocity (i.e., a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second) for the first time, and successfully launched cosmic rockets. The three artificial Earth satellites launched by the Soviet Union in the past were heavier and of higher scientific value than the previous ones. The last stage of the current cosmic rocket weighs 1,472 kilograms, which is 145 kilograms heavier than the third artificial Earth satellite. Through the three artificial Earth satellites launched in the past, Soviet scientists have accumulated extremely valuable data on solar radiation, cosmic rays, micrometeorites, ionospheric structure, and medical physiology of interstellar navigation. The cosmic rocket launched this time carries more complex and precise scientific and measuring instruments, and also launched an "artificial comet." After flying over the moon, it will become the first artificial solar satellite in human history. This will undoubtedly provide the world of science with more valuable information that has never been obtained before. This is an indelible contribution made by Soviet scientists and engineering technology experts to the cause of human happiness and peace.
    The Soviet cosmic rocket going into space is another powerful proof of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The socialist system not only provides unprecedentedly superior conditions for the development of industry and agriculture, and for the development of cultural and educational undertakings, but also opens up unprecedentedly broad possibilities for the development of science and technology. Under the socialist system, Soviet scientists and the broad masses of workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government, can fully exert their talents and creativity, cooperate with each other in the spirit of communism, and use collective wisdom and strength to overcome all difficulties on the road forward and climb the peaks of world science. In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has done tremendous work to promote the development of Soviet science. In the draft report on the "Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy in 1959-1965" that Comrade Khrushchev will make to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a grand program for the development of Soviet science in the next seven years is also stipulated. Khrushchev said in the draft report, "The state allocates a large amount of funds to build new scientific institutions, and equip research institutes and laboratories with the latest equipment. Soviet scientists have revealed the mysteries of atomic and thermonuclear reactions, and created artificial Earth satellites. They will enrich our country's science with greater discoveries and achievements." Now, on the eve of the opening of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet cosmic rocket is a gift from Soviet scientists to this congress, and also a victorious start to the Soviet Seven-Year Plan.
    The launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket is another powerful proof that the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind. After the Soviet Union's third large artificial Earth satellite went into space, the US ruling group, in a state of panic, hurriedly clamored to launch a "lunar satellite," hoping to precede the Soviet Union in launching cosmic rockets in order to conceal the US's backwardness in rocket technology. However, it failed in four consecutive test launches. The US's blind launch of "lunar satellites" in an attempt to succeed by chance has become a laughing stock all over the world! Even US rocket experts themselves admit that the US is "trying to run before it has learned to walk"! Seeing the failure of the "lunar satellite" launch time after time, the US even wanted to cover the sky with one hand, and claimed that the "Atlas" satellite with an effective weight of only 67.5 kilograms was heavier than the Soviet Union's third large satellite, but this lie was quickly exposed. Bluffing and lying failed to save the US from the disastrous defeat in the rocket technology race. The successful launch of the Soviet giant cosmic rocket has made the White House, the Pentagon, and the entire capitalist world dumbfounded. Scientists in the United States and Britain cannot help but admit: "This is really a remarkable big guy," "It is indeed a very huge project"! Soviet rocket technology continues to overwhelm the United States. The Soviet Union has left the United States even further behind in important science and technology. The East wind prevails everywhere in the world, and the days of imperialism are getting harder and harder!
    The new achievements of Soviet science have greatly strengthened the strength of the socialist camp and greatly encouraged the struggle of the people all over the world for peace and social progress. The Chinese people, together with the socialist countries and all progressive people, are warmly cheering for the Soviet Union's launch of the cosmic rocket. We sincerely congratulate the Soviet scientists, engineering technologists, and all the Soviet people on the brilliant achievements they have made under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that mankind will conquer outer space. The successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket shows that the era of mankind flying in outer space will not be far away!

### 响彻宇宙的社会主义凯歌

    响彻宇宙的社会主义凯歌
    一支“红色的火箭”，正向月球飞行，高奏着社会主义的凯歌。这就是苏联1月2日发射的世界上第一支成功地作星际飞行的宇宙火箭。到3日晚上十点五十分（北京时间），这支火箭已达到距离地球二十二万七千公里的高度，预计今天中午十二点左右即可到达月球区域。伟大的苏联人民就这样地在1959年岁首为世界进步人类作出了划时代的贡献。正如苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫所说的，飞往行星就是我们这一代的事情了。
    苏联向月球方向发射宇宙火箭，标志着苏联科学技术的新高峰，也开创了人类征服宇宙空间的新纪元。多少世纪以来，人们就梦想着御风而行，遨游太空。我国一直流传着“嫦娥奔月”的故事，但那不过是一篇美丽的浪漫主义的神话而已。今天，这种大胆的遨游太空的幻想，正在逐渐变成现实。人类征服宇宙空间的崇高的希望，正在随着苏联的宇宙火箭，上升，上升，再上升！1957年10月4日，苏联的第一颗人造地球卫星上了天，那是人类征服宇宙空间的第一步。仅仅过了一年又三个月，苏联的第一颗宇宙火箭又上了天，这是人类征服宇宙空间的第二步。苏联科学家和工程技术专家不但从理论上研究了星际飞行的一系列重要问题，而且在实践上创造了惊天动地的伟大成就。在人类的科学历史上，苏联科学家和工程技术专家第一次解决了第一宇宙速度
  （即每秒八公里的速度）的问题，成功地发射了人造地球卫星，接着又第一次解决了第二宇宙速度（即每秒十一点二公里的速度）的问题，成功地发射了宇宙火箭。苏联过去发射的三颗人造地球卫星，就是一个比一个更重，一个比一个的科学价值更高。现在的宇宙火箭的最后一级重达一千四百七十二公斤，又比第三颗人造地球卫星重一百四十五公斤。苏联科学家通过过去发射的三个人造地球卫星，就已经在太阳辐射、宇宙线、微流星、电离层结构以及星际航行的医学生理学方面，积累了极为宝贵的资料。这一次发射的宇宙火箭，带有更复杂更精密的科学和测量仪器，并且发射了“人造彗星”。它在飞过月球之后，将成为人类历史上第一个人造太阳卫星。这无疑将为世界科学提供至今所不能得到的更加宝贵的资料。这是苏联科学家和工程技术专家对人类的幸福和和平事业所作的永不磨灭的功勋。
    苏联的宇宙火箭上了天，是社会主义制度无比的优越性的又一次有力的证明。社会主义制度，不仅为工业农业的发展，为文化教育事业的发展，提供了空前优越的条件，而且也为科学技术的发展开辟空前广阔的可能性。在社会主义制度下，苏联科学家和广大劳动者，在共产党和政府的领导下，能够充分地发挥他们的才能和
            创造性，以共产主义的精神互相协作，以集体的智慧和力量，征服前进道路上的一切困难，攀登世界科学的高峰。近年来，苏联共产党作了巨大的工作，推动了苏联的科学发展。在赫鲁晓夫同志将向苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会作的关于“1959—1965发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲中，又规定了在今后七年内苏联科学发展的宏伟纲领。赫鲁晓夫在报告提纲中说，“国家拨出大量经费建设新的科学机关，以最新的设备装备研究所和实验室。苏联科学家揭示了原子及热核反应的奥秘，制造了人造地球卫星，他们将以更伟大的发现和成就来丰富我国的科学。”现在，在苏共第二十一次代表大会开幕前夕，苏联的宇宙火箭是苏联科学家对这次大会的献礼，也是苏联七年计划的胜利的开端。
    苏联宇宙火箭的发射，又是东风进一步压倒西风的又一次有力的证明。当苏联第三个人造地球大卫星上天以后，美国统治集团在惊惶失措之余，赶忙叫嚷着要发射“月球卫星”，希望能在发射宇宙火箭方面赶在苏联的前面，以便掩饰美国在火箭技术上的落后状况。可是，它一连试验发射四次都失败了。美国盲目地发射“月球卫星”，希图侥幸成功的作法，已经成为全世界的笑柄！这连美国的火箭专家自己也承认，美国是“还没有学会走路，就想跑步”！眼看着“月球卫星”的发射一次一次地失败，美国竟然想一手遮天，把有效重量只有六十七点五公斤的“阿特拉斯”卫星说成是比苏联第三个大卫星还重，可是这个谎言很快就被揭穿了。吹牛和扯谎都没有能挽救美国在火箭技术竞赛上的惨败。苏联巨型宇宙火箭的发射成功，更使白宫、五角大楼以及整个资本主义世界瞠目结舌。美国和英国的科学家们不能不承认：“这真是一个了不得的大家伙”，“实在是一项非常巨大的计划”！苏联的火箭技术继续压倒美国。苏联在重要的科学技术方面又更远地把美国抛在后边了。人间天上遍东风，帝国主义的日子是更加不好过了！
    苏联科学的新成就，大大地加强了社会主义阵营的力量，大大地鼓舞了全世界人民争取和平和社会进步的斗争。中国人民同社会主义各国和全体进步人类一起，为苏联发射宇宙火箭而热烈欢呼。我们衷心祝贺苏联科学家、工程技术家和全体苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下所取得的辉煌的成就。我们深信，人类必将征服宇宙空间。苏联宇宙火箭的发射成功表明：人类飞翔于宇宙空间的时代的到来，是不会很久了！
