    Reported by this newspaper: In 1958, the officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army achieved tremendous results in supporting and participating in the country's socialist construction. According to statistics, the total number of voluntary labor days contributed by the entire army to socialist construction last year reached over 59 million, an increase of nearly two times compared to 1957. This achievement powerfully demonstrates that the People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force defending the motherland but also a production force building the motherland.
    In order to support the great leap forward in agriculture, at the beginning of last year, various units generally formulated labor plans to support and participate in socialist economic construction and submitted them to the local Party committees. Under the unified arrangement and leadership of the local Party committees, they participated in activities such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, disaster relief, and plowing, harvesting, and other agricultural activities in a planned manner. During the mass movement to build water conservancy projects, the vast number of officers and soldiers, with the attitude of charging into battle, braved the wind and snow, blasted stubborn rocks, broke through solid ice, and dug frozen soil, displaying their skills in water conservancy construction. By the end of last year, the army units had contracted for and helped local areas build more than 20,000 water conservancy projects, completing over 58 million cubic meters of earthwork. After the troops in the Shenyang area accepted the task assigned by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee to contract for the construction of the main canal of the Hunsha Irrigation Area, the leaders of the troops, General Deng Hua, Lieutenant General Du Ping, and others, personally convened military and political leaders from various units and responsible persons from relevant local departments, laid out maps, and deployed the construction tasks like deploying a battle. Thousands upon thousands of troops immediately rushed to the construction site, braving the severe cold of minus 10 or 20 degrees Celsius, and launched full-scale construction. The slogan of the officers and soldiers was: "The Red Army fears not the Long March, heroes fear not the north wind's cold, building water conservancy in the frozen land, socialist realization will come early." In just 21 days, they completed the construction of the 44-kilometer-long main canal and the 12-kilometer-long main drainage canal, releasing water for irrigation 40 days ahead of schedule. At the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, the general headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and the troops in the Beijing area had more than 8,200 officers and soldiers participating in the construction every day. In order to rush to complete this large-scale water conservancy project before the flood season arrived, the troops participating in the construction increased sharply to 45,000 people per day, and 324 trucks, 76 tractors, and other large-scale machinery were allocated to support the construction. This ensured that the completion ceremony of the Ming Tombs Reservoir was successfully held on "July 1st".
    Throughout the past year, the PLA units also donated more than 15.73 billion jin of various fertilizers to farmers in various places, supporting the bumper agricultural harvest. At the same time, the units actively participated in the fight to rush-harvest and rush-plant, deeply plow the land, and combat drought and flood prevention. According to statistics from the troops and navy in seven regions, including Jinan, Wuhan, and Beijing, last year, they helped local people harvest more than 400,000 mu of crops and deeply plowed nearly 100,000 mu of land. During the summer harvest last year, after the Wuhan area troops heard the weather forecast that there would be a large storm in Henan, they immediately dispatched tens of thousands of officers and soldiers, purchased tools themselves, and traveled dozens or even hundreds of miles to help the masses rush to harvest more than 140,000 mu of wheat day and night. After the summer planting, drought occurred in some areas of Hubei, and extraordinarily large floods appeared in some rivers in Henan. At this time, the Wuhan area troops quickly dispatched a nearly 30,000-strong army to fight drought and flood prevention, and under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, they joined the masses in the fight against drought and flood prevention. In this struggle, the officers and soldiers supported more than 100,000 workdays, watered more than 10,000 mu of farmland, built 42 canals, and dug 58 wells, and timely rescued the seedlings. The troops participating in flood control, when the floods of the Luohe and Jianhe rivers invaded the urban area of ​​Luoyang, the officers and soldiers bravely jumped into the rapids at the breach and built three human walls with their bodies. After three days and nights of hard work, seven river dams were quickly built, the rampant floods were controlled, and the safety of the urban area was guaranteed.
    With the progress of the People's Liberation Army in technical revolution, the agricultural front has also received more and more new assistance from the troops. In the past year, in addition to supporting farmers in various places with many tractors and various agricultural machinery, air force units in Shenyang, Beijing, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing and other places have also successively cooperated with relevant local scientific research institutions to successfully test artificial rainfall, artificial cloud dissipation, and artificial cloud creation. The Air Force unit in the Shenyang area dispatched 22 sorties of aircraft to carry out artificial rainfall over Yongji, Jiaohe, and Shulan counties in Jilin Province, with a maximum rainfall of 25 mm, exempting 40,000 hectares of farmland from drought. The People's Air Force also sprinkled more than 50,000 kilograms of 666 insecticide powder over farmland where insect pests occurred, exempting more than 210,000 mu of crops from insect damage.
    A new feature of the troops' participation in national construction in 1958 was that the Army, Navy, and Air Force all participated in industrial construction with great strength. According to statistics from the Nanjing area troops alone, last year, there were 82 large-scale factories directly participating in the construction and expansion, including Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant Nos. 1 and 3, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant Nos. 1 and 2, and Nanjing General Machinery Plant. More than 1,400 various power machines, 198 cars, and more than 1,000 horse-drawn carts were allocated or donated to the local area; the troops with mechanical equipment also processed 1,068 various machine tools, lathes, and power machinery and more than 420,000 mechanical parts for local factories. In order to ensure that the Iron and Steel Marshal ascended to the tent, the officers and soldiers of the entire army threw themselves into the various battlefields of smelting, mining, collecting scrap iron and steel, supporting iron and steel transportation, and basic industrial construction with soaring enthusiasm. In supporting iron and steel transportation, the troops of the entire army drew more than 8,800 cars and the best drivers to form a car transportation team, which was handed over to the local party committee for command, and drove day and night on the iron and steel transportation lines across the country. The drivers said that they were not afraid of wind and rain, and they were not afraid of the dark night and dangerous roads. Wherever the local party committee pointed, they would transport it there. Some drivers not only took care of driving, but also took care of packing, unloading, and ensuring safety. In the two months from mid-September to mid-November last year, the Air Force dispatched 791 sorties of aircraft and completed 1.51 million tons of kilometers of transportation tasks. The Navy also dispatched many warships to support iron and steel transportation. In the battle of great steelmaking, many troops temporarily stopped exercises and went all out. Leading cadres of the Jinan, Kunming, and other regions also fought alongside the officers and soldiers by the stove. During this period, the entire army also collected more than 114,000 tons of scrap iron and steel, overfulfilling the task of "recovering 100,000 tons of scrap iron and steel."
    Practice over the past year has proved that the People's Liberation Army vigorously supports and participates in the country's economic construction, which not only powerfully supports the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, but also greatly enhances the labor concept of officers and soldiers through labor training, which in turn promotes the great leap forward in the troops' combat readiness training and various tasks. By participating in industrial construction, the officers and soldiers also broke the mysterious view of industrial technology, thereby powerfully promoting the technical revolution of the troops. Some units that could only perform repair tasks in the past quickly took on the task of trial-producing new products, and many units have been able to produce the equipment needed by the troops themselves, and have successfully trial-produced many new equipment for the troops.
    At present, according to the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the troops of the People's Liberation Army are preparing with full confidence to make greater efforts, together with the people of the whole country, to make greater contributions to the completion of this year's even greater national economic construction plan.

    空中飞机海上舰艇陆上千军万马齐出动
    三军将士誉满经济战线
    本报讯　1958年，中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军指战员，在支援和参加国家社会主义建设事业中，取得了巨大的成绩。据统计，全军去年参加社会主义建设的义务劳动日共达五千九百多万个，比1957年增加近两倍。这一成绩，有力地证明了人民解放军既是保卫祖国的战斗队，又是建设祖国的生产队。
    为了支援农业大跃进，去年年初，各部队便普遍地制定了支援和参加社会主义经济建设的劳动规划，交给当地党委。在当地党委统一安排和领导下，他们有计划地参加了兴修水利、积肥、抢险和耕种、收割等农事活动。在大兴水利的运动中，广大官兵以冲锋陷阵的姿态，冒着风雪，炸顽石，破坚冰，挖冻土，在水利建设中大显身手。到去年年底止，全军各部队包修和帮助地方修建的水利工程共达两万多项，完成土石方达五千八百多万立方公尺。沈阳地区部队接受了中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会交给的包修浑沙灌区总干渠的任务后，部队首长邓华上将、杜平中将等亲自召集各单位军政首长和地方有关部门的负责人，摆开地图，像部署战斗一样布置了施工任务。千军万马立即开赴施工现场，冒着零下一、二十度的严寒，展开全面施工。官兵们的口号是：“红军不怕远征难，英雄何惧北风寒，冰天雪地修水利，社会主义早实现。”仅仅二十一天的时间，他们便完成了四十四公里长的总干渠，和十二公里长的总排干渠的修建任务，提前四十天放水灌溉。在十三陵水库工地上，人民解放军各总部和北京地区部队，每天都有八千二百多名官兵参加施工。为了在洪水期来临之前突击完成这一规模宏大的水利工程，参加施工的部队激增到每天四万五千人，并调拨出三百二十四台汽车、七十六台拖拉机等大型机械，支援施工。终于保证了十三陵水库在“七一”胜利地举行了落成典礼。
    去年一年中，人民解放军各部队还赠送给各地农民各种肥料一百五十七亿三千多万斤，支援了农业大丰收。与此同时，各部队还积极参加了抢收抢种、深翻土地和抗旱、防汛等斗争。仅据济南、武汉、北京等七个地区的部队和海军的统计，去年共帮助当地群众收割庄稼四十多万亩、深翻土地近十万亩。去年夏收时，武汉地区部队听到河南将有大风暴的气象预报后，立即出动了数万名官兵，并自买工具，远征数十里乃至数百里，日夜帮助群众抢收小麦十四万多亩。在夏种以后，湖北部分地区发生旱灾，河南部分地区的河流出现了特大洪峰，这时，武汉地区部队连忙出动了近三万人的抗旱、防汛大军，在当地党委统一领导下，和群众一道投入了抗旱、防汛斗争。在这一斗争中，官兵们共支援了十万多个劳动日，车水灌田一万多亩，修筑水渠四十二条，水井五十八眼，及时地抢救了禾苗。参加防汛的部队，当洛河、涧河的洪水侵向洛阳市区时，官兵们奋勇地跳进决口处的激流里，用身体筑起了三道人墙。经过三昼夜的奋战，迅速筑起了七条拦河大坝，制服了泛滥的洪水，保障了市区的安全。
    随着人民解放军在技术革命方面的进展，农业战线上也愈来愈多地得到了部队新的援助。去年一年中，各部队除了支援各地农民许多拖拉机和各种农业机械以外，沈阳、北京、兰州、武汉、南京等地空军部队，还先后协同地方有关科学研究机构试验成功了人工降雨、人工消云和人工造云。沈阳地区空军部队曾出动二十二架次飞机，在吉林省永吉、蛟河、舒兰三县上空进行人工降雨，最大降雨量达二十五公厘，使四万垧农田免除了旱象。人民空军还在发生虫灾的农田上空，撒投了五万多公斤六六六杀虫粉，使二十一万多亩农作物免受虫害。
    1958年，部队参加国家建设的一个新的特点是，陆、海、空三军都以很大的力量参加了工业建设。仅据南京地区部队的统计，去年直接参加兴建和扩建的大型工厂，就有上海钢铁厂一、三厂，马鞍山钢铁厂，南京钢铁厂一、二厂，南京通用机器厂等共八十二处。调拨或赠送给地方各种动力机械一千四百多台，汽车一百九十八台，马车一千多辆；有机械设备的部队，还为地方工厂加工各种机床车床和动力机械一千零六十八台，机械零件四十二万多件。为了确保钢铁元帅升帐，全军官兵更以冲天的干劲投入了冶炼、采矿、收集废钢铁、支援钢铁运输和工业基本建设等各个战场。在支援钢铁运输中，全军各部队抽调了八千八百多台汽车和最优秀的司机，组成汽车运输队，交由地方党委指挥，日夜奔驰在全国各地的钢铁运输线上。驾驶员们说，不怕风吹雨打，不怕夜黑路险，地方党委指向哪里，就运到哪里。有些驾驶员不仅做到包开车，还做到包装、包卸、保安全。空军在去年9月中旬到11月中旬的两个月内，还出动了七百九十一架次飞机，完成了一百五十一万吨公里的运输任务，海军部队也出动了很多舰艇，支援钢铁运输。在大炼钢铁的战斗中，许多部队曾短期停止操课，全力以赴。济南、昆明等地区部队的领导干部，也和官兵们一起在炉旁鏖战。在此期间，全军还收集了十一万四千多吨废钢铁，超额完成了“回收十万吨废钢铁”的任务。
    一年来的实践证明，人民解放军大力支援和参加国家经济建设，不但有力地支援了工农业生产的大跃进，而且通过劳动锻炼，大大地增强了官兵的劳动观念，进而又推动了部队战备训练和各项工作的大跃进，通过参加工业建设，官兵们还打破了对工业技术的神秘观点，从而有力地推动了部队的技术革命。有些原来只能担任修理任务的单位，很快地担任起试制新产品的任务，许多单位已能自己生产部队需要的器材，并为部队试制成功了许多新的装备。
    目前，根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，人民解放军各部队正满怀信心地准备以更大的努力，和全国人民一道，为完成今年更加伟大的国民经济建设计划而做出更大的贡献。（附图片）
