	Long Live the Friendship Between China and Germany
	——Premier Grotewohl's Visit to Dongba

January 27th was neither a festival nor a holiday, but in Dongba, a suburb of the capital, firecrackers popped, drums roared, and colorful arches were erected on the streets. Beside the gate of the Dongba Management Station, couplets were posted: "Welcoming distinguished guests from ten thousand miles, distance cannot separate our hearts; Building together, let us advance hand in hand," with the horizontal inscription reading "Welcome, Welcome." This scene was even more lively than the Spring Festival. What happy event made the commune members so joyous? It turned out that they had "double happiness": first, Premier Grotewohl and his wife, along with the distinguished guests of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and others, came to visit them; second, this management station was named the China-Germany Friendship People's Commune.

Premier Grotewohl's visit brought honor to the more than six thousand households of the Dongba Management Station, and conveyed the deep friendship of the heroic German people. His concern for the management station will forever be remembered in the hearts of the Dongba people. In the office of the management station, Premier Grotewohl sat closely with Fu Zongkun, the Party Secretary of the management station, and spoke cordially. The Premier said, "It is very good that you now eat without paying, but you must remember that you must first and foremost do a good job in production every year and strive for a bumper harvest." He also asked, "Do your management personnel just stay in the office?" Fu Zongkun said, "No, we eat, live, and work with the commune members." Premier Grotewohl said, "That's right, you should try to keep management personnel away from the office as much as possible. We are doing the same now." Fu Zongkun listened carefully, grateful for the Premier's concern.

After Premier Grotewohl and his wife arrived at the kindergarten, dozens of boys and girls stood in formation in the courtyard, directed by six-year-old Li Yuhua, and sang "Socialism is Good" in unison. After the song, Premier Grotewohl and his wife affectionately stroked Li Yuhua's head, and the Premier's wife, while saying "Very good" in Chinese, knelt down and pinned a commemorative badge on Li Yuhua's chest. Then Premier Grotewohl took a red toy tractor from a box, handed it to Deputy Director Ren Xiuqing, and said, "This is for the children. This tractor is just a model. We wish the children a successful adulthood and wish that they will all be able to drive tractors and cultivate your fields in the future."

Wherever Premier Grotewohl and the distinguished guests went, they brought great encouragement to the people there. When they came to the countryside to view the large areas of high-yielding wheat fields, more than a hundred commune members, men and women, were digging river mud on the nearby river滩 to apply it to the fields. Fu Zongkun introduced that last year the wheat yield was only 170 jin per mu, and this year it is planned to reach 2,000 jin per mu. In addition to deep plowing and close planting, another yield-increasing measure is to apply more fertilizer. Premier Grotewohl initially shouted "Friendship" in Chinese to the people accumulating fertilizer. When leaving, he repeatedly waved to them and shouted "Goodbye" in Chinese. The people accumulating fertilizer applauded to welcome the distinguished guests, and then they launched an even more intense labor upsurge.

At the ceremony where the management station was named the China-Germany Friendship People's Commune, Premier Grotewohl presented several gifts to the management station, which contained the deep sentiments of the German people. Premier Grotewohl pointed to a radio and said, "Please accept it. This is the manifestation of the labor of our working class. I hope that whenever you see it, you will be able to think of us." The Premier also picked up a small movie camera that was presented to the management station and said, "I hope you will use it to record the development path of your commune."

At this grand naming ceremony, Premier Grotewohl solemnly presented a flag of the German Democratic Republic to the Dongba Management Station. He enthusiastically said in poetic language: "We present to you the flag of the German Democratic Republic. This flag has three colors, black, red, and yellow. Black symbolizes our overcoming the dark past, red symbolizes the internationalist unity of our socialist countries, and yellow symbolizes the beautiful color of the future, the color of happiness."

People still clearly remember that when Premier Grotewohl first visited China in 1955, he represented the German socialists, the descendants of Marx and Engels, the loyal friends and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, and handed over to Premier Zhou Enlai the ten flags of the Yihetuan that were seized by the German militarists. At that time, people accepted this gift of great friendship with respect. Today, when Premier Grotewohl presented the tricolor flag to Fu Zongkun at the naming ceremony, and when he and Vice Premier Chen Yi shook hands tightly, the more than two thousand people who attended the ceremony were immediately excited and beat drums, cheering to their heart's content. The sound of "Long live the friendship between China and Germany" resounded through the clouds. This sound represented the hearts of all the Chinese people.

What language can we use to jointly express this friendship? Premier Grotewohl then said, "We and you have different national languages, but we have a common language, and that common language is 'The Internationale'. Let us all sing the Internationale once!" After Premier Grotewohl finished speaking, he faced the bright sunshine, stood up straight, waved his hand, and started singing the lead:

"Arise, ye prisoners of starvation! Arise, ye wretched of the earth!..." At this time, the songs of Vice Premier Chen Yi, the distinguished guests of the German government delegation, and the commune members followed and joined in. This song of the world's proletarians tells us that although the German people and the Chinese people live in the west and east of the socialist camp, the German people and the Chinese people are brothers, and their hearts are connected!

    中德友谊万年春
    ——格罗提渥总理访问东坝记
    新华社记者　汪波清
    1月27日，不是过年也不是逢节，但是首都郊区的东坝，这天鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓喧天，街头上高搭彩门，东坝管理站的大门旁还贴了对联：“万里迎贵宾地远心近，共同搞建设携手前进”，横眉写着“欢迎欢迎”，这番情景比过年还要热闹。是什么喜事使社员们这般喜气洋洋？原来他们“双喜临门”，一是格罗提渥总理和他的夫人与德意志民主共和国政府代表团的贵宾们，由陈毅副总理等陪着到他们这里来作客，二是这个管理站命名为中德友好人民公社。
    格罗提渥总理的来访，为东坝管理站六千一百多户社员带来了荣誉，带来了英雄的德意志人民的深情厚谊。他对管理站的关怀，将永远牢记在东坝人民的心上。在管理站的办公室里，格罗提渥总理和这个管理站的党委书记傅宗昆紧挨着坐在一起，亲切地谈话。总理说：“你们现在吃饭不要钱，这很好，可是你们要记得，首先你们必须年年搞好生产，要争取大丰收。”他还问道：“你们管理人员是不是光呆在办公室里？”傅宗昆说：“不是，我们是和社员们同吃同住同劳动的。”格罗提渥总理说：“对，要尽可能让管理人员远离办公室，现在我们也是这样做。”傅宗昆细心地听着，感谢总理的关怀。
    格罗提渥总理和他的夫人来到幼儿园以后，几十个男女孩子整队站在院子里，由六岁的李玉华指挥，齐声唱“社会主义好”。唱完后，格罗提渥总理和他的夫人亲热地抚摸着李玉华的头，总理夫人还一边用中国话说“很好”，一边蹲下来为李玉华的胸前别上一个纪念章。接着格罗提渥总理从一个盒子里取出一架红色的玩具拖拉机，把它递给副园长任秀清，他说：“这是送给孩子们的，这架拖拉机只是一个模型，我们祝孩子们长大成人，祝他们将来都能够驾驶着拖拉机，在你们的田地上耕种。”
    格罗提渥总理和贵宾们不论走到哪里，便给哪里的人们带来了莫大的鼓舞。他们来到村外观看大面积丰产麦田的时候，附近的河滩上正有一百多名男女社员挖河泥，准备把它施到田里去。傅宗昆介绍说，去年小麦每亩产量才是一百七十斤，今年计划每亩产量达到两千斤，除了深耕、密植以外，另外一项增产措施就是多施肥。格罗提渥总理起先向积肥的人们用中国话高呼“友好”，离开这里时，他还一再向他们招手，并用中国话高呼“再见”。积肥的人们迎着贵宾们鼓掌，接着他们便又掀起了更为紧张的劳动热潮。
    在管理站命名为中德友好人民公社的仪式上，格罗提渥总理向管理站赠送了几件礼物，这些礼物包含着德意志人民的深厚的心意。格罗提渥总理指着一台收音机说：“请收下它吧，这是我们工人阶级的劳动的表现，我希望你们每当看到它的时候，就请你们能够想起我们。”总理还拿起赠给管理站的一部小型摄影机说道：“我希望你们用它把你们公社的发展道路纪录下来。”
    在这个隆重的命名仪式上，格罗提渥总理庄严地把一面德意志民主共和国国旗送给东坝管理站，他热情地用诗一般的语言说道：“我们把德意志民主共和国的国旗赠给你们，这旗有黑、红、黄三种颜色，黑色象征我们克服了黑暗的过去，红色象征我们社会主义各国的国际主义的团结，那黄色是象征着未来的美好的颜色，是幸福的颜色。”
    人们还清楚地记得，在1955年格罗提渥总理第一次访问中国的时候，他曾经代表德国的社会主义者，马克思和恩格斯的子孙，中国人民的忠实朋友和战友们，把德国军国主义者夺去的义和团的十面旗帜，亲手交给了周恩来总理。那时人们怀着崇敬的心情接受了这个伟大友谊的礼物。今天，当格罗提渥总理在命名仪式上把三色国旗赠给傅宗昆的时候，当他和陈毅副总理紧紧地握手的时候，参加仪式的两千多人顿时激动得打起锣鼓，尽情欢呼，“中德友好万岁”的声音响彻云霄，这声音代表了全体中国人民的心意。
    用什么语言来共同表达这种友情呢？格罗提渥总理接着说：“我们和你们各有不同的民族语言，但是我们有共同的语言，这个共同的语言就是‘国际歌’，让我们大家唱一遍国际歌吧！”格罗提渥总理说罢，迎着灿烂的阳光，挺起胸膛，把手一挥，第一个开始了领唱：
    “起来，饥寒交迫的奴隶，起来，全世界的罪人……。”这时，陈毅副总理、德国政府代表团的贵宾们、社员们的歌声跟着合了上去。这全世界无产者的歌声告诉我们：虽然德国人民和中国人民生活在社会主义阵营的西方和东方，但是德国人民和中国人民是兄弟，他们是心连着心啊！
