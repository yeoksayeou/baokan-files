    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th—TASS reports: Recently, Party organizations in various localities of the Soviet Union held representative conferences or congresses to discuss the outline of Khrushchev's report on the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965, which will be presented at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the tasks proposed by local Party organizations for the completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

    On the 14th, the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held its Fourteenth Party Congress. Ustinov, the First Secretary of the City Party Committee, said at the opening ceremony that more than 1.5 million people had discussed Khrushchev's report outline on the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy from 1959 to 1965 at the workers' meetings held in Moscow.

    When talking about the great tasks of the new Seven-Year Plan, Ustinov said that the fundamental issue for the Soviet Union in the next seven years is to accelerate economic development along the road to communism and to win the maximum amount of time in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism.

    When talking about the development of Moscow in the next seven years, Ustinov said that one of the main directions of Moscow's industry is to produce many new machines, instruments, machinery, and appliances to supply the technical transformation of various sectors of the national economy. He said that the total output of industrial products of some enterprises under the Moscow City National Economic Council will increase by more than 43% in seven years, of which 83% will be achieved by increasing labor productivity.

    In his report, Ustinov said that the working people of the Soviet capital, like all Soviet people, discussed the splitting activities of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, which attempted to undermine the implementation of the 20th Party Congress's established guidelines on major domestic and foreign policies.

    On the 14th, the Communist Party of Kazakhstan held its Ninth Extraordinary Congress in Alma-Ata. Belyaev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, delivered a report on Khrushchev's report outline on the Seven-Year Plan and the tasks of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. Then the meeting began to discuss the report.

    苏联人民迎接七年计划巨大任务
    各地党组织召开会议讨论赫鲁晓夫报告提纲
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社讯：最近苏联各地党组织召开了代表会议或代表大会，讨论赫鲁晓夫将在苏共第二十一次代表大会上提出的关于1959—1965年发展国民经济七年计划的报告提纲和各地党组织为完成七年计划而提出的任务。
    14日苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会召开第十四次党代表会议。市党委第一书记乌斯季诺夫在开幕会上讲话说，已有一百五十多万人在莫斯科举行的劳动者会议上讨论了赫鲁晓夫关于1959—1965年发展国民经济七年计划的报告提纲。
    乌斯季诺夫谈到新的七年计划的巨大任务时说，苏联今后七年的根本问题是沿着共产主义的道路加速发展经济，是在社会主义与资本主义的和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间。
    乌斯季诺夫谈到莫斯科在未来七年间的发展情况时说，莫斯科工业的主要发展方向之一是生产许多新的机器、仪器、机械和器具，以供应国民经济各个部门的技术改造之用。他说，莫斯科市国民经济委员会的一些企业的工业产品的总产量在七年内将要增加43％以上，其中83％将靠提高劳动生产率来达到。
    乌斯季诺夫在报告中说，苏联首都的劳动人民，同所有苏联人一样，讨论了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫反党集团的分裂活动，这些活动是企图破坏实现二十次党代表大会制定的关于对内和对外政策主要问题上的方针。
    14日，哈萨克共产党在阿拉木图召开第九次特别代表大会。哈萨克共产党中央第一书记别利亚耶夫在会上就赫鲁晓夫关于七年计划的报告提纲和哈萨克共产党的任务作了报告。接着会议开始讨论这个报告。
