    A Mountain Delicacies Restaurant
    Jiang Boheng, Wang Linru
    Have you ever seen a restaurant that uses only wild game as ingredients? In Yichun, a famous city in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest region, we came across such a restaurant called "Hunter's Mountain Delicacies Restaurant." This restaurant uses meat from wild animals abundant in the forest – elk, roe deer, wild boar, bear, rabbits, and wild fowl – to create various delicious dishes. The variety of dishes is numerous, with good quality and low prices, and fresh and delicious flavors. Strangers who come here are all filled with curiosity and become patrons of this restaurant.
    On the day we arrived in Yichun, we stepped into this restaurant. As soon as we entered, a fragrant aroma of meat wafted towards us, stimulating our appetite. Several young waiters warmly greeted us, showed us to our seats, and presented us with the menu: stir-fried roe deer meat slices, deep-fried elk meatballs, wild boar dumplings... In addition to ordering a few stir-fried dishes, we also ordered two bowls of wild boar dumplings to try. At this time, a young forestry worker sitting next to us enthusiastically introduced us while eating: "The smoked bear meat here is the fattest and most delicious, and bear paws are even more famous delicacies." Immediately, he picked up his wine glass and drank a cup heartily, and then excitedly said: "The elk's nose is the most fragrant part, and no one here doesn't love to eat it. This meat is also very cheap, look, such a large plate is only 50 cents." Just as we were talking lively, the waiter brought over the stir-fried meat dishes and wild boar dumplings, which tasted unique and truly lived up to its name as "mountain delicacies." We looked around at the full house of customers, and besides a few people like us who came out of curiosity, the vast majority were hunters from the Yichun forest area. The waiter told us that this mountain delicacies restaurant is a product of Yichun's vigorous mass hunting production. Last winter and this spring, more than 800 people throughout Yichun City went hunting in the mountains. In order to show concern for these hunters who climb mountains and cross ridges, Yichun City specially opened this unique restaurant. Hunters can enjoy an 80% discount when eating here.

    一个山珍饭馆
    姜伯衡　王麟儒
    你见过完全用野味作菜的饭馆吗？在著名的小兴安岭林区城市伊春，我们就遇到了这么一家饭馆，名叫“猎民山珍饭店”。这个饭馆全用森林里盛产的野兽——犴大犴、狍子、野猪、熊瞎子、兔子和山禽等肉作出各种美味的菜肴。菜的花样繁多，物美价廉，清新可口。陌生的人来到这里，都抱着一种好奇心，来作这个饭馆的座上客。
    我们来到伊春的当天，就跨进了这家饭馆。一进门，阵阵扑鼻的肉香向我们袭来，引起了我们浓厚的食欲。几位年青的服务员，热情地招呼我们就座，并送上了菜谱：狍子肉溜肉段，犴大犴肉炸丸子、野猪肉饺子……。我们除叫了几盘炒菜外，还要了两碗野猪肉饺子尝尝。这时，坐在我们旁边的一位年青的林区工人，一边吃着，一边热情地向我们介绍：“这里的熏熊肉最肥美，熊掌更是著名的佳肴”。随即他端起酒开怀畅饮了一杯，又兴致勃勃地说：“犴大犴的鼻子最香不过，在这儿没人不爱吃的。这种肉也很便宜，你们看，这么一大盘才五角钱。”正在我们谈得热闹的时候，服务员送来了炒肉菜和野猪肉馅饺子，吃起来别有风味，真是名不虚传的“山珍”。我们环顾满座顾客，除少数与我们一样前来猎奇的人之外，绝大部分都是伊春林区的猎民。服务员告诉我们：这个山珍馆是伊春大搞群众性狩猎生产的产物。去冬今春，全伊春市有八百余人上山狩猎。为了对这些爬山越岭的猎民表示关怀，伊春市特开办了这家别具风味的饭店。猎民在这里吃饭可以享受八折的优待。
