Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 9th: The Information Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, wrote a letter on January 5th to Sarit Thanarat, Chairman of the Thai "Revolutionary Committee," regarding the issue of Overseas Vietnamese in Thailand. The letter expressed opposition to the Thai authorities' persecution of Overseas Vietnamese in Thailand, demanded that the Thai authorities immediately take measures to stop the persecution, and requested the early restoration of freedom for the arrested Overseas Vietnamese.

In the letter, Pham Van Dong said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is always willing to hold negotiations with the Thai government on the issue of Overseas Vietnamese returning home, based on respect for the legitimate rights of Overseas Vietnamese." Pham Van Dong said that during the Bandung Conference in 1955, he had initially exchanged views with Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand on the issue of Overseas Vietnamese returning home, and that the two sides had reached a consensus in principle: that the two governments must resolve the issue of Overseas Vietnamese returning home through consultation.

Pham Van Dong said in the letter: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the above-mentioned actions and intentions of the Thai authorities violate the principles of international law regarding the treatment of foreigners, violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding the protection of human rights and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, and violate the spirit of the meeting between Prince Wan Waithayakon and myself during the Bandung Conference, and damage the friendly relations between the Vietnamese and Thai nations."

    范文同总理致函乃沙立
    要求泰当局制止迫害越侨
    新华社河内9日电　越南外交部新闻司今天公布了越南总理范文同在1月5日就旅泰越侨问题写给泰国“革命委员会”主席乃沙立的一封信，信中表示反对泰国当局迫害旅泰越侨的行为，要求泰国当局立即采取措施制止迫害事件发生，并要求早日恢复被捕越侨的自由。
    范文同在信中说：“越南民主共和国政府始终愿意在尊重越侨正当权利的基础上同泰国政府就越侨回国问题举行谈判。”范文同说，他在1955年万隆会议期间，曾经同泰国的旺·威泰耶康亲王就越侨回国问题初步交换了意见，并且在原则上双方取得一致意见：即两国政府必须通过协商解决越侨回国问题。
    范文同在信里说：“越南民主共和国政府认为，泰国当局的上述行为和意图都违背了国际法有关对待外侨的原则，违背了联合国宪章有关保卫人权的条款和联合国1948年的人权宣言，也违背了旺·威泰耶康亲王和我在万隆会议期间会谈的精神，并且损害了越泰两个民族之间的友好关系。”
