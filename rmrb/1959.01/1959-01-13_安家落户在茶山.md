    Settling Down in the Tea Plantation
    Huang Jinbao, Waitang Township, Yongchun, Jiangxi

    This time last year, when we carried our bags and crossed mountains to arrive at this sparsely populated mountain area, we were all out of breath, probably because we were so tired from climbing. Soon after, when we picked up hoes and started working in the tea garden, we didn't know what to do. We kept smashing the hoes into the ground, which resulted in broken skin and swollen hands, and we could only cultivate three or two ridges a day. When it came to making tea and processing the fresh leaves, we had to shake the leaves, and after shaking a few times, our palms were blistered, and the tea leaves were scattered all over the ground. The workers patiently guided us again and again, but we just couldn't get the hang of it, and we kept doing things our own way. We were really anxious. Finally, after several months of diligent study and hard work, we were able to handle the hoe with ease; when making tea and processing the fresh leaves, we no longer scattered the leaves all over the ground. The worker comrades were inseparable from us, sharing food, lodging, and hardships. Sometimes there were no non-staple foods in the mountains, and everyone ate turnips together; ten or so people were crowded into one room.

    A few months ago, two batches of transferred cadres were transferred to support industrial construction, and the workers couldn't help but feel sad. It's true that after a year of labor and life together, everyone was like family, and now that family members were leaving, a sense of unhappiness would inevitably flash through their minds. After some explanation, their thoughts were straightened out. Just like children raised by their mothers, once the motherland needs them, they have to part! The workers treated the transferred cadres like their own brothers. Even that comparison is not accurate. The feelings between the workers and the transferred cadres far exceeded those of blood brothers!

    Now, the workers regard the transferred cadres as capable assistants in production, and they are afraid that they will be transferred away again. The transferred cadres also regard the workers as their teachers on the road to becoming both red and expert, and they don't want to leave the mountain area. Some have already found tea-picking girls to be their sweethearts, and some have already brought their families here, planning to settle down in the tea plantation for a long time.

    安家落户在茶山
    江西永春外塘乡　黄谨宝
    去年的今天，我们背着包袱翻山越岭来到这个人烟稀少的山场时，因为是爬山太累了吧！个个气喘吁吁。不久，拿起锄头在茶园里劳动时，也不知道怎么做才好，一个劲地把锄头向地里砸，结果弄得皮破手肿，一天中耕不了三、两丘。制茶做菁，要摇菁，摇了几下，手掌心起泡了，还弄得满地茶菁。工人们耐心地一遍二遍的指导，但就是手不应心，依然故我。我们心里也着实焦急。总算勤学苦干几个月以后，使锄头得心应手了；制茶做菁，菁叶也不致撒得满地了。工人同志同我们不分彼此，同吃，同住，同甘共苦。山上有时没有什么副食品，大家一齐大吃菜头；十来个人挤在一个房间里住。
    前几个月，调走了两批下放干部支援工业建设，工人们禁不住难过起来。说来也真是，经过一年的劳动生活，大家像亲人般的，如今亲人要离去，总会情不自禁地在心头掠过一阵不快的。经过一番解说，他们思想也通了，就像母亲抚育的子女，一旦祖国需要，也得分别的呀！工人们对下放干部就像亲兄弟似的，这个比喻还不恰当，工人与下放干部的感情，远远超过了亲兄弟呢！
    工人们如今把下放干部当作生产上的得力助手，就怕再要被调走，下放干部也把工人当作自己向红专道路迈进的老师，不愿离开山场，有的已找准了采茶姑娘做对象，有的已经把家属接来，打算长期安家落户在茶山了。
