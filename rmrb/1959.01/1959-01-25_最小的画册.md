    The Smallest Picture Book
    Qu Liuyi
    I saw a kind of smallest comic book in the Hefei Children's Bookstore. I found it novel and couldn't help but flip through it. This picture book is slightly larger than a matchbox, and it adopts the folding style of early ledger books. A small booklet contains twenty or thirty pictures, accommodating three to five short stories. The pictures are all colored, and the slightly harder cover can appropriately extend the life of the picture book in the hands of young children. In short, it is small and exquisite, and each one sells for only a few cents.
    The content is mostly about children's lives, or small life stories that children can understand: some depict children's heroic struggle against the enemy, some praise their contributions in the Great Leap Forward, and some eulogize Lebanese children fighting against American soldiers.
    This small picture book, with its good content and good form, makes me applaud the designer and the painter, and also applaud the publisher, Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House. Thank you for your working spirit of considering preschool children. The small picture books sell quickly and in large quantities, which proves that preschool children are very welcome to it. Look, a young mother bought three sets and put them in her baby's small pocket, not too big or too small, just right. The baby patted the bulging little pocket with his chubby little hands and smiled at the female salesperson.

    最小的画册
    曲六乙
    在合肥儿童书店看到一种最小的连环画册，觉得新奇，不免翻看几下。这画册略比火柴盒大一些，是采取早年写流水账的折叠式的。一个小册子有二三十幅画面，竟容纳三五个小故事。画面全是彩色的，稍硬的封皮可以使画册在幼儿手里适当延长寿命。总之，小巧玲珑，而每种售价只几分钱。
    内容大都是儿童生活，或者儿童可以理解的生活小故事：有描绘儿童对敌英勇斗争的，有赞美他们在大跃进中的贡献的，还有歌颂黎巴嫩儿童同美国兵斗争的。
    这小画册，内容好，形式好，我不禁为设计者和画家鼓掌，也向出版者上海人民美术出版社鼓掌。感谢他们为学前儿童着想的工作精神。小画册销售得又快又多，证实了学前儿童非常欢迎它。瞧，一位年轻的妈妈，买了三套，放在宝宝的小衣袋里，不大不小，正好装下。宝宝用小胖手拍着鼓鼓的小衣袋，向女售货员笑了。
