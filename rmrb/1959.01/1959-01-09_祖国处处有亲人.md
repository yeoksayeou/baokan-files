    Everywhere in the Motherland There Are Loved Ones

    Sending Medicine from Afar

To the Editor:

    I am writing this letter with great excitement, mainly to thank all the comrades at the Lao Cun Ren Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu.

    Here's what happened: I am a foundry worker who was hospitalized in the Dalian Railway Hospital for diabetes. Western medicine was used to treat me with insulin, but last year the supply of insulin was insufficient, and my condition worsened. In today's era of great steel production, it was so distressing for a foundry worker like me to be stuck in the hospital all day!

    Just then, a veteran Chinese medicine doctor from Dalian Medical College offered a family secret recipe for treating diabetes. The Railway Hospital decided to treat me with Chinese medicine. However, one of the ingredients in the prescription—荠菜花 (荠菜 flower or shepherd's purse flower)—could not be found anywhere in Dalian. I asked relatives and friends all over the Northeast and Beijing, but the replies were all "unavailable." Then a comrade reminded me that I could write directly to pharmacies in various places. So, with a try-it-and-see attitude, I wrote to the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company. They replied that this medicine was not available in Beijing, but that the Zhenjiang pharmaceutical company in Jiangsu might have it. Getting this clue, I quickly wrote to the Zhenjiang Pharmaceutical Company. They replied that they didn't have it either, but they helped me find out that a joint state-private old Cun Ren Tang pharmacy in the city had this medicine and forwarded my letter to them. Soon, the comrades at Lao Cun Ren Tang wrote back, comforting me by saying, "…Don't worry, although you have no relatives or friends here, as long as you send the payment upon receipt of the letter, we can guarantee to supply you with the medicine you need and pack and ship it for you." I quickly remitted the money. What moved me even more was that they originally planned to use a wooden box for packaging and send it by post, but the wooden box would cost one or two yuan, and the postage would be four yuan. To save me money, they bought a piece of kraft paper and a flour bag to pack it for me and sent it by railway. In this way, the total cost, including packaging and shipping, was only more than one yuan and fifty cents. They even gave me a clear invoice and bought postage stamps with the remaining money and sent them back to me! This communist style of wholeheartedly serving patients and customers is so admirable!

    I believe that such things and such people can only exist in our country, in the society led by our Party. When I return to work, I will definitely work harder to repay these enthusiastic people.

     Meeting Loved Ones Everywhere

To the Editor:

    I am a trainee in a parachute training class, and I am often troubled by high blood pressure. On November 20th of last year, I saw good news in the People's Daily: the new product "Xue Ke Ping" manufactured by Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory in 1958 has an exceptionally good effect on lowering blood pressure. This made me very happy, and I wrote a letter to the factory with full enthusiasm and hope to inquire about the situation. But shortly after sending the letter, I was very disappointed because the envelope did not specify the address, only "Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory Receives," and the letter might not be delivered. At the same time, I thought that such a large pharmaceutical factory, especially during the Great Leap Forward, might not be willing to delay their work for a little private matter of mine.

    Who knew that on the afternoon of December 7th, I suddenly received a letter and a package of medicine from the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory. At that time, I really didn't believe it could be true. I wondered: did the postal worker really deliver my letter with the unclear address? Did the responsible comrades of the pharmaceutical factory really take this matter seriously? I opened the envelope with a doubtful feeling and read it in one breath. Ah! It was written so detailed and sincere, not only telling me the prescription, function, advantages, application range, usage, dosage, etc. of this medicine, but also telling me where I should go to buy this medicine, and what to do if I can't buy it… The letter also included a detailed instruction manual, and the medicine was sent to me for trial use. As I read the letter and the instructions, I couldn't help but burst into tears.

    I deeply feel that in our country, we can meet loved ones everywhere, and we can meet people everywhere who wholeheartedly think of others and have a communist style!

### 祖国处处有亲人

专栏：读者来信

    祖国处处有亲人
    千里迢迢寄药来编辑同志：
    我以十分激动的心情写这封信，主要是为感谢江苏镇江老存仁堂国药店的全体同志。
    事情是这样的：我是一个铸工工人，因得了糖尿病住在大连铁路医院里，西医用胰岛素给我治，去年胰岛素供应不上，我的病情恶化了，在大办钢铁的今天，作为一个铸工工人却整天住在医院里，我的心情是多么焦急呀！
    正在这时，大连医学院有一位老中医献出了一个治疗糖尿病的祖传秘方，铁路医院就决定请中医给我治，可是在这个药方里有一味中药——荠菜花，在全大连市都买不到。我托亲友们问遍东北各地和北京市，回信都是“没有”。这时有个同志提醒我可以直接给各地药店去信，于是我怀着试试看的心理给北京市药材公司写了封信，他们回信说这种药北京市还没有，说江苏镇江的药材公司可能有。得到了这个线索，我赶紧向镇江药材公司写信，他们回信也说没有，但他们却替我访问到该市一家公私合营的老存仁堂药店说有此药，并把我的信转给了他们。不久，老存仁堂的同志来信了，他们安慰我说：“……不必焦急，你虽在此地无亲友，但只要见信把药款寄来，我们可以保证供应你需要的药并代装代寄，我很快把款汇去了。更使我感动的是，他们原说用木箱包装，由邮局寄，但木箱需一两元、邮费要四元。为了使我少花钱，他们代我买了张牛皮纸和一个面袋子包装，并且由铁路发运来了，这样连包装带运费总共才花了一元五角多，还为我开清账单把剩余的款买成邮票给我寄回来了！这种全心全意为病人、为顾客着想的共产主义风格是多么可敬啊！
    我认为这样的事，这样的人，只有在我们的国家、在我们的党所领导下的社会里才会有。当我重回工作岗位时，一定加倍努力来回答这些热心的人们。
     大连市大连铁路医院结核四病房 李家瑞
     到处逢亲人编辑同志：
    我是一个跳伞训练班的学员，由于患高血压症时常苦恼。去年11月20日，我在人民日报上看到一个好消息：西安制药厂1958年制造的新产品“血可平”，降低血压的效能异常良好。这可把我乐坏了，我怀着满腔的热情和希望给该厂去了一封信询问情况。但信发出不久，我又十分失望，因为信封上没有写明地址，只写了个“西安制药厂收”，信可能寄不到。同时想到这么大的药厂，又值大跃进时期，人家未必肯为我一个人的一点私事耽误工夫。
    谁知12月7日下午，我突然收到了一封信和一包药，原来是西安制药厂寄来的。当时，我真有点不相信这会是真的。我想：邮递员同志真把我那封地址不明的信寄到了吗？药厂的负责同志真把这件事当回事办了吗？我抱着怀疑的心情拆开信封，一口气读下去。啊！里面写的是那样详细恳切，不但告诉了我这种药品的处方、作用、优点、应用范围、用法、用量等等，并且还告诉我应该到哪里去买这种药，如买不到又怎么办等……。信里还附来一张详细说明书，药也是送给我叫我试用的，我一面看着信和说明书，一面就忍不住的泪水夺眶而出。
    我深深感到，在我们的国家里，到处都能遇到亲人，到处都能遇到全心全意为别人着想的具有共产主义风格的人！　山东跳伞队队员
