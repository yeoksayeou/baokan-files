(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th dispatch) Jiangsu Province, the pioneer of rope traction machines, has seen widespread use of these machines, with new improvements and enhancements, due to the emphasis placed by local leaders on relying on the masses and using indigenous methods to promote them.

Last year, Jiangsu Province used rope traction machines for deep plowing on 60% of its cultivated land during the autumn plowing and planting season. The work efficiency was generally five to six times higher than manual plowing. This not only laid a solid foundation for agricultural production increase but also pointed out a new way to solve the contradiction of labor shortages in the overall leap forward of industrial and agricultural production. Taixing County saved more than three million labor days by using rope traction machines for deep plowing in its 400,000 mu of autumn planting fields. Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County saved more than 100,000 labor days and solved the technical requirements of deep plowing by using rope traction machines for its 84,000 mu of autumn plowing tasks. Moreover, the planting date was advanced by half a month compared with previous years, greatly boosting the farmers' confidence in increasing production through deep plowing. The masses reflected, "Guan-style plowing is really good, men and women, old and young, can do it; turning dead fields into treasures, next year's granary will be taller than the building." Especially in paddy field areas, the farmers' labor intensity was reduced, and they were freed from the difficult plowing situation of "people up to their waists, cattle up to their bellies," which made them more deeply appreciate the benefits of promoting rope traction machines.

Rope traction machines have also played a huge role on water conservancy construction sites after the autumn plowing. So far, more than 100,000 rope traction machines have been used for earth transportation in water conservancy projects, increasing the average work efficiency per person by five to ten times. In Taixing County's water conservancy construction site, more than 8,000 rope traction machines were put into climbing and transporting earth, increasing the daily excavation and transportation efficiency per person from three cubic meters to about ten cubic meters, with a maximum of more than sixty cubic meters.

Rope traction machines have also achieved significant results when used in rice transplanting, harvesting, and fertilization. Yancheng County used rope traction machines to drive rice transplanting boats and fertilization boats in paddy fields, increasing work efficiency by two to three times compared with the old methods. Several counties in the Yangzhou area, such as Jiangdu, also achieved good results by using rope traction machines to drive double-blade plows to dig sweet potatoes. The Jiangdong Commune in the suburbs of Nanjing has basically succeeded in experimenting with using rope traction machines to pull three-wheat harvesters.

Now, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Party Committees at all levels, the workers, peasants, and masses of the whole province, together with scientific and technical personnel, are continuously improving the structure of rope traction machines, which are showing broader development prospects and unlimited vitality. Changshu County recently used the power of water-lifting machines to successfully trial-produce automated mechanical rope traction machines and automatic lifting and lowering bidirectional plows, creating a good start for establishing field power stations and realizing agricultural mechanization, electrification, and automation. Now, they are using this principle to study applications in harvesting, sowing, and transplanting operations. Hongqi People's Commune in Wuxi County created a pile-less rope traction machine, which solved the shortcomings of the past, where moving piles consumed auxiliary time and labor. Yancheng County also created a "simple electric plow" that can cultivate both paddy and dry land, requiring only a five-kilowatt generator to drive it.

The reason why Jiangsu Province's rope traction machines have been able to persist in promotion and use and continuously improve is, first of all, because the Provincial Party Committee and leaders at all levels have strengthened their leadership in this work, holding on-site appraisal meetings at all levels, using superior examples of using rope traction machines to educate the masses, so that cadres and the masses have changed from doubting and worrying about rope traction machines to supporting them.

Secondly, from creation to promotion and use, the working method of mass movement has been closely implemented, which has not only relied on the masses to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but also rapidly strengthened the manufacturing and use of technical forces, and a large number of rope traction machine operators have emerged. If the more than 100,000 rope traction machines in the Yangzhou area were manufactured solely by the original 9,000 carpenters, it would not be completed in two months. Due to mobilizing the masses, 80,000 workers and peasants worked together, and the task was basically completed in only twenty days. In terms of cultivating technical forces, Taixing and Jiangdu counties and other counties have timely held amateur technical schools and organized deep-plowing corps to train rope traction machine operators.

Thirdly, the principle of "using indigenous methods first, from indigenous to foreign," and combining popularization with improvement has been adhered to. Rope traction machines, mainly based on human and animal power, can be quickly promoted throughout the province, and are readily accepted and continuously improved by the broad masses, mainly because of their low cost, convenient material acquisition, simple structure, easy manufacturing and use, and ability to meet deep-plowing requirements. When rope traction machines were first promoted, like other improved agricultural tools, it was impossible to be perfect at once, and there must be a process of continuous research and improvement through use. According to this development law, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee adhered to the principle of combining indigenous methods with foreign methods and popularization with improvement, relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses to continuously carry out reforms, so that rope traction machines continue to improve.

Fourthly, adhering to the spirit of continuous reform, organizing professional teams, and strengthening the scientific and technological research work on rope traction machines, in addition to timely holding technical training courses and cultivating technical forces, Party committees at all levels have established agricultural tool reform scientific and technological research organizations in many counties, cities, and communes to strengthen the research and improvement of rope traction machines from a scientific and technological perspective.

Now, Jiangsu Province is organizing forces to systematically summarize and comprehensively plan the promotion and improvement of rope traction machines from a scientific and technological perspective, requiring that in 1959, with human and animal-powered rope traction machines as the center, a part of rope traction machines driven by mechanical power and electricity should be developed accordingly in all areas with suitable conditions, setting off a tool reform upsurge that is larger and better than in 1958.

    提高劳动效率　解决劳力不足
    江苏综合利用绳索牵引机
    本报南京19日电　首创绳索牵引机的江苏省，由于各地领导强调依靠群众，土法上马，坚持推广，绳索牵引机已得到普遍使用，并且有了新的改进和提高。
    江苏省去年在秋耕秋种中，已有60％的耕田面积使用了绳索牵引机进行深耕，工效比人翻一般提高五、六倍以上，不仅为农业增产奠定了可靠的基础，而且为解决工农业生产全面大跃进中劳动力紧张的矛盾，指出了一个新的出路。泰兴县在四十万亩秋种田里，使用了绳索牵引机深耕，即节省三百多万个劳动力。江都县小纪人民公社八万四千亩秋耕任务，由于使用了绳索牵引机，不仅节省了十万多个劳动力，解决了深耕技术要求，而且下种日期也比往年提前了半个月，大大鼓舞了农民对深耕增产的信心。群众反映说：“绞关耕田真正好，男女老少都能搞；死田翻身成活宝，明年粮囤比楼高。”特别在水田地区因减轻了农民耕作劳动强度，摆脱了“人齐两胯、牛齐肚皮”那种艰难的耕作情景，使农民对推广绳索牵引机的好处，体会更加深刻。
    绳索牵引机秋耕后在水利工地上同样发挥了巨大作用。到目前为止，已有十多万部绳索牵引机用于水利运土，使每人平均工效提高五到十倍不等。泰兴县水利工地，有八千多部绳索牵引机投入了爬坡运土，每人每日挖运工效从三方上升到十方左右，最高达六十多方。
    绳索牵引机开始使用在插秧、收割、施肥等方面，也获得显著成就。盐城县前后利用绳索牵引机带动插秧船插秧，和带动施肥船在水田施肥，工效比老办法提高二到三倍。扬州专区江都等几个县，用绳索牵引机带动双铧犁挖山芋，效果也很好。南京市郊江东公社试用绳索牵引机牵引三麦收割器已基本成功。
    现在江苏省全省工农群众，在省委和各级党委的领导下，和科学技术人员一起，从结构上不断改进，绳索牵引机更加显示了广阔的发展前途和无限生命力。常熟县最近利用戽水机动力，试制成功了自动化机力绳索牵引机和自动升降双向犁，为设立田间动力站、实现耕作机械化、电气化、自动化创造了良好开端。现在他们通过这个原理正在研究用于收割、播种、插秧操作。无锡县红旗人民公社创造了无桩绳索牵引机，解决了过去因移桩花费辅助时间和劳力多的缺点。盐城县还创造了“简易电犁”，水旱田都可耕作，只需五瓩发电机就可带动。
    江苏省绳索牵引机所以能够坚持推广使用和得到不断提高，首先，是由于省委和各级领导加强了对这一工作的领导，层层召开现场评比会议，以使用绳索牵引机的优越实例教育群众，使干部群众对绳索牵引机由怀疑、顾虑变为拥护。
    其次，从创造到推广使用，紧紧贯彻了群众运动的工作方法，从而不仅依靠群众解决了原材料不足的困难，而且迅速地壮大了制造与使用技术力量，涌现了大批绳索牵引机手。扬州专区十多万部绳索牵引机，如单靠原有九千多个木工制造，二个月还不能完成。由于发动群众，八万工农齐动手，结果只二十多天，就基本完成了任务。在培养技术力量方面，太兴和江都等县都及时举办了业余技术学校和组织深耕兵团，培养绳索牵引机手。
    第三，坚持了“土法上马，由土到洋”，普及与提高相结合的方针。以人畜力为主的绳索牵引机，能够在全省很快推广，为广大群众乐意接受和不断提高，主要是：成本低、取材方便、结构简单、制造与使用容易，又能解决深耕要求。绳索牵引机在开始推广时，与其他改良农具一样，一时不可能十全十美，而必须有通过使用不断研究改进的过程。江苏省委根据这一发展规律，坚持了由土到洋和普及与提高相结合的方针，依靠群众，发动群众不断进行改革，使绳索牵引机不断完善提高。
    第四，坚持不断改革的精神，组织专业队伍，加强了对绳索牵引机的科学技术研究工作，各地党委对绳索牵引机的制造和使用，除及时举办技术训练班，培养技术力量外，很多县、市和公社都建立了农具改革科学技术研究组织，从科学技术上加强绳索牵引机的研究改进。
    现在，江苏省对绳索牵引机推广和提高工作，正在组织力量，从科学技术上进行系统的总结和全面规划，要求在1959年以人、畜力绳索牵引机为中心，在一切有条件的地区相应发展一部分用机械动力和电力带动的绳索牵引机，掀起一个比1958年更大更好的工具改革高潮。　　　　　　　　　　（高浩群　金士林）
