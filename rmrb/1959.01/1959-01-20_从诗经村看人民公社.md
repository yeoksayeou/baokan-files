    Seeing People's Communes from Shijing Village
    By our reporter Deng Zichang

    Recently, I visited the Dongfeng People's Commune in Shijing Village, Hejian County, on the Hebei Plain. It has more than 41,400 people, covering an area 30 li (15 km) long from east to west and 20 li (10 km) wide from north to south, with more than 137,000 mu (9133 hectares) of cultivated land. This commune was established on September 1, 1958. In terms of age, it is just an infant of less than five months old, but like a giant with strong vitality, it has done many things that could not be done in the past, bringing tremendous changes to this place, from production to life, from labor to learning.
      A peal of spring thunder
    As soon as the Dongfeng People's Commune was established, it fought its first major battle in the "Three Autumns" campaign while vigorously developing iron and steel and water conservancy construction. At that time, the commune engaged in iron and steel and water conservancy construction, occupying more than 3,700 laborers. Because the work of establishing the commune was not yet completed, many people were worried that this might affect the completion of the "Three Autumns" tasks. However, the commune unified and mobilized more than 7,200 laborers to form a large corps to rush to deep-plow and sow wheat. They plowed and sowed as they plowed, completing the deep-plowing and sowing of more than 37,000 mu of land in early November, all reaching a deep-plowing depth of more than 1.5 chi (0.5 meters), applying more than 7,000 jin (3500 kg) of fertilizer per mu in layers, and using more than 30 jin (15 kg) of seeds per mu. This greatly improved the quality of cultivation compared to any previous year, and the winter wheat was sown more than ten days earlier than in 1957 when the agricultural cooperative completed planting. Zhang Chengwab had 1,100 mu of land suitable for wheat planting. In the past, because this land was "wet in the morning, hard at noon, and impossible to hoe in the evening," it was never deep-plowed or base-fertilized. But this time, the commune irrigated and drained this low-lying area, and then mobilized 670 shock troops to work hard and skillfully for four days to turn this low-lying area into a wheat field. People said that if it were still a small village cooperative, not to mention all the wheat fields, even this low-lying area would not be planted with wheat until the New Year.
    The commune then organized a professional wheat field management team of more than 3,600 laborers, with each person responsible for managing an average of ten mu, clarifying the responsibility system and taking responsibility to the end. They paid close attention to winter field management such as topdressing, watering, and covering with manure, as well as straightening ridges. At present, all the wheat fields have basically achieved garden-style management, and the wheat seedlings are growing better than in previous years, greener, stronger, denser, and more uniform.
    As soon as the commune was established, it encountered a bumper autumn harvest, but the tasks of iron and steel, deep plowing, and wheat planting came one after another, affecting the initial harvesting and threatening to cause great losses. How to ensure a bumper harvest was a major problem facing the commune at that time. The commune promptly educated its members to pay attention to careful harvesting and mobilized all manpower to launch two "secondary autumn harvests", achieving a bumper harvest. The output of grain, cotton, and oil crops in 1958 increased by one-third to nearly half compared to 1957. Not only did more than 90% of the members increase their income, but for the first time, more than 1.07 million jin of surplus grain was sold to the state, and more than 360,000 yuan was added to the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund.
    Now, most of the land waiting for people to sow has been autumn-plowed or deep-plowed, and the ground is flat without clods. On this vast land, more than 50 tall derrick frames stand, and groups of young men and women commune members are drilling machine wells.
    On the sixth day after the establishment of the commune, the commune's tractor station was also established. This station currently has more than 30 mechanics and owns five tractors, more than ten large agricultural machines, etc., and has mechanically cultivated more than 20,000 mu of land for the commune.
  Opening Up the Flowers of Industry
    The once tranquil countryside now has the roar of machines, which is the boiler of the commune-run iron and wood repair factory at work. At first glance, this factory is not outstanding. The factory building is an ordinary house; the large production tools include only one boiler, six four-foot and six-foot lathes. Among the 101 workers, only 33 were small blacksmiths and carpenters in the past, and the rest are all ordinary commune members. However, it is such a factory that, with people's daring to think and act, using indigenous methods and scrap iron, can not only repair and assemble general agricultural machinery and manufacture various large and small production tools, but also recently trial-produced a complete set of parts and components for diesel engines - cylinder heads, cylinder blocks, oil reservoirs, running wheels, gears, governors, crankshafts… The first batch of diesel engines will be installed soon. The annual plan is to produce 300 units for use in the commune's machine wells and industrial production. Factories like this are just one of the newly built and expanded factories after communization. At present, the commune has a total of 202 factories (groups) including local fertilizer, agricultural and sideline product processing, paper making, brick and tile, cement, knitting, and sewing, with a total of more than 1,500 workers, an increase of more than 500 workers compared to before communization.
    These factories are making increasing contributions to supporting the commune's development of production and increasing the income of commune members. The 23 local fertilizer factories alone can provide more than 500,000 jin of various local fertilizers every day.
  Turning It into a Land of Flowers and Fruits
    Hejian Ya pears have a wide sales market. Five villages under the jurisdiction of the commune are one of the producing areas of this kind of pear. However, there used to be contradictions between agriculture and fruit tree production here, which restrained and affected each other. Even during the agricultural cooperative period, due to the limitations of manpower and habits of each cooperative, there were only agricultural production teams and no fruit tree professional teams, which still neglected one thing for another, affecting the full development of fruit tree production. Now, the commune has more people and greater strength, and has made unified labor arrangements, extracting more than 680 experienced members and forming five fruit tree professional teams respectively. Breaking old habits, it strengthened the winter management of fruit trees for the first time, and the pruning, deep plowing, fertilization, and watering were all done very carefully. On the basis of the existing 3,100 mu of fruit trees, it has newly planted 3,010 mu of fruit trees mainly pear trees, and plans to plant a total of more than 53,000 mu of fruit trees this year, striving to gradually turn this place into a "land of flowers and fruits".
    The commune has also developed a variety of operations and sideline production such as poultry, livestock, transportation, weaving, and charcoal burning, with a total of more than 30 projects, investing labor of more than 3,000 people. As of before the New Year, it has earned 185,000 yuan. Compared with the same period in 1957, the number of projects has increased by more than 20, the number of people has increased by more than two times, and the income has increased by 122,000 yuan.
  Women compete to praise the commune
    Now, the commune has established a large number of canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, sewing factories, knitting factories, etc., which have completely liberated women's labor force and opened up smooth paths for women to participate in social activities and achieve equal pay for equal work with men.
    Among the 530 households of the Junziguan Village Production Team, because ten kindergartens and nurseries have been established, taking care of more than 80% of the children, the 373 women who used to be burdened by children have been able to participate in various production and service industries. Young woman Zhang Daxiu participated in production from an early age and worked no less than a strong young man. She has won three awards in the village. She got married in 1954, and because she had to cook at home, and then had children, she rarely had the opportunity to participate in labor. In the three years from 1955, she only worked two or thirty labor days each year. After the establishment of the commune, she happily spread her wings and flew into labor to show her skills.
    "One person gives birth, the whole family is worried," this is a depiction of the tense situation of rural women during childbirth in the past. In the agricultural cooperative period, although there had long been many new-style midwives trained by the government, pregnant women still gave birth at home, and the care for pregnant women was not adequate. Now, the commune has established several maternity hospitals, and pregnant women can stay in the maternity hospitals, where they are cared for by special personnel, and receive special care in terms of nutrition such as brown sugar, millet, and eggs, and they can still receive wages during the 45-day maternity leave. This commune has given birth to a group of small citizens. According to the statistics of two maternity hospitals, 37 pregnant women have been received in the hospital, and 28 boys and nine girls have been delivered, and all the adults and children are very healthy. A pregnant woman, Nie Yingxin, was carrying a stillborn baby. The midwife removed the stillborn baby for her, so that her health was not damaged.
    Women from the bottom of their hearts compare the commune to paradise, and unanimously reflect that the commune is most beneficial to them. Therefore, everyone is comfortable and full of energy, and advanced women's collective units and individuals are constantly emerging. For example, the work of drilling wells is very difficult, but among the 1,300 well-drilling team members in the commune, more than 630 are women; among the 55 model well-drilling team members who recently won awards, 28 are women. The women's well-drilling team led by Li Xiuan worked hard to study and improve the well cone, pierced the iron plate sand layer, and the quality of the machine wells drilled was very good. It was rated as an advanced well-drilling team by the commune and won the first well-drilling red flag.
  A new generation is growing
    Near the commune's office location, there are several rows of red-tiled gray-walled buildings, which is the newly established agricultural school of the commune. This school has 15 teachers, including six cadres sent down by the All-China Women's Federation; there are more than 500 male and female students. At present, in addition to studying junior high school cultural courses in separate classes, students also study mechanics or horticulture. Mechanics are taught by technical cadres from the tractor station, and fruit tree majors are taught by fruit tree "local experts".
    The commune also newly established a junior high school class with 136 students, and all high school graduates who did not go to higher education entered the middle school.
    The original 20 classes in elementary schools have also been expanded, and 16 new classes have been added. The number of students has increased from more than 4,600 to more than 5,500, accounting for 99% of school-age children. In addition, there are more than 350 children who are over the age of schooling who have also entered schools.
    The biggest feature of these schools is that they truly combine learning with labor and vigorously cultivate a new generation that is both workers and peasants and has culture. Students in agricultural schools study for three days a week, work for three days, and rest for one day. Combined with their studies, they have established ten labor sites such as fertilizer plants, livestock farms, and woodworking factories. Middle school students work for three hours a day during busy farming seasons and one or two hours a day during slack farming seasons. They have picked cotton on 2,000 mu of land, plowed 120 mu of land, and sown 150 mu of wheat for the commune, which has been praised by the members.
              ※
    This place is called "Shijing Village," and it is said that this is where Mao Chang lectured on the "Book of Songs." Today, in this place, people living in the happy era of communization also use poetry to sing out the true feelings of their experiences and feelings in the new society, praising the birth of the people's commune and praising the strong vitality of the people's commune. From the establishment of the commune to recently, the commune members have created and narrated a large number of poems. After the commune organized special personnel to collect and organize them, they were bound into volumes and have been printed in fourteen issues, and named "New Book of Songs".
    The Spring Festival is coming soon. The commune will take a five-day vacation, and the members are brewing a grand poetry competition to sing the incomparably superior people's commune again to their heart's content.

### 从诗经村看人民公社

    从诗经村看人民公社
    本报记者　　邓子常
    在河北平原上，最近我访问了河间县诗经村乡东风人民公社。它有四万一千四百多口人，占地面积东西长三十里，南北宽二十里，有耕地十三万七千多亩。这个公社1958年9月1日建立。从年岁上看不过是个不满五个月的幼儿，但它已像具有强大生命力的巨人一样，办了许多过去没有力量办到的事情，使得这地方从生产到生活，从劳动到学习，无不发生着极大的变化。
      春雷一声响
    东风人民公社刚成立，就在大搞钢铁、水利建设的同时，在“三秋”战役中打了第一个大胜仗。当时，公社大搞钢铁和水利建设，占用了三千七百多个劳力。因建社工作还未就绪，好些人都曾担心，这样可能会影响完成“三秋”任务。但是，公社统一调动七千二百多个劳力，组成突击深翻种麦的大兵团，随翻随种，在11月初完成深翻种麦三万七千多亩，全部达到深翻一尺半以上，每亩分层施肥七千斤以上，每亩用种三十斤以上，比以往任何一年都大大提高了耕种质量，并比1957年农业社种完冬麦的时间提前了十多天。张成洼有一千一百亩地，宜于种麦，过去因为这些地“早晨湿，中午硬，一到傍晚耪不动”，从不深翻地，施底粪。可是这次公社对这片洼地进行了灌溉和排水，紧接着就调动六百七十名突击大军，苦干巧干四天，把这个洼变成了小麦洼。人们说，若还是单村小社，别提全部麦田，就只这个洼到过年也种不上麦。
    公社接着又组织了三千六百多个劳力的麦田管理专业队，平均每人专管十来亩，明确责任制，一包到底，对追肥、浇水、盖粪等冬季田间管理，以及整畦、整垅等，都抓得紧，作的细致。目前，全部麦田基本达到了园田化，麦苗长的比往年好，又绿、又壮、又密、又整齐。
    公社一成立，正遇到农业秋季大丰收，但因钢铁、深翻、种麦等任务一个连一个，影响初期收割，眼看就会造成大损失。如何保证丰产丰收，是当时摆在公社面前的一个重大问题。公社及时教育社员注意精打细收，又动员一切人力掀起两次“二次秋收”，作到了丰产丰收，使1958年的粮食、棉花和油料作物，分别比1957年增产三分之一到近半倍，不仅使90％以上的社员增加了收入，第一次有一百零七万多斤余粮卖给了国家，还新增加了三十六万多元公积金和公益金。
    现在，等候着人们去播种的那些土地，绝大部分经过了秋耕或深翻，地面平整，没有坷垃。就在这片广阔的土地上，矗立着五十多盘高大的井架子，一伙伙男女青壮年社员正在锥打机井。
    就在公社成立的第六天，公社的拖拉机站也宣告成立了。这个站现有机务人员三十多人，拥有五台拖拉机，十多部大型农业机具等，已为公社机耕了二万多亩地。
  开放工业之花
    一向宁静的农村，现在有了机器的吼声，这是社营铁木修配厂的锅驼机在工作。从外表上乍一看，这个厂并不出色，厂房是普通住房；大的生产工具只有一台锅驼机、六台四尺和六尺的车床。在一百零一个工人中，只有三十三个人过去是小炉匠和木工，其余全是普通社员。可是就是这样一个厂，凭着人们敢想敢干的精神，土办法加废铁，不仅能够修配一般农业机器，制造多种大、小生产工具，而且最近试制出了柴油机的全套部件和零件——机头、机身、油胡芦、行轮、齿轮、调速器、湾轴……不久就可安装出第一批柴油机，全年计划要生产三百台，供社里的机井和工业生产上使用。像这个厂，只是公社化后新建和扩建的工厂中的一个，现在全社共有土化肥、农副产品加工、造纸、砖瓦、水泥、针织、缝纫等二百零二个工厂（组），共有一千五百多个工人，比公社化以前增加工人五百多名。
    这些工厂为支持公社发展生产和增加社员收入，正在作着越来越大的贡献。只二十三个土化肥厂，每天就可提供五十万斤以上的各种土化肥。
  要它变成花果之乡
    河间鸭梨，销路很广。公社所辖有五个村就是这种梨的产地之一。但是，这里过去存在着农业和果树生产的矛盾，互相牵制和影响。即在农业社时期，也由于各社受人力和习惯的限制，只有农业生产队，没有果树专业队，仍然顾此失彼，影响了果树生产的充分发展。现在，公社人多力量大，统一作了劳力安排，抽调出六百八十多名有经验的社员，分别编成五个果树专业队，破除旧习惯，第一次加强了对果树的冬季管理，整枝、深翻地、施肥、浇水等都作的很细致。还在现有果树三千一百多亩的基础上，新栽了三千零十亩以梨树为主的果树，计划今年共要种果树五万三千多亩，力争逐步把这里变成为“花果之乡”。
    公社还发展了家禽、家畜、运输、编织、烧炭等多种经营和副业生产，项目共三十多种，投入劳力达三千多人，截至年前已收入十八万五千元。和1957年同期比较，项目增加二十多种，人数增加两倍多，收入增加十二万二千元。
  妇女争夸公社好
    现在，公社办了大量的食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、缝纫厂、针织厂等，彻底解放了妇女劳动力，为妇女参加社会活动、实现和男人一样同工同酬，开辟了顺畅的道路。
    君子馆村生产队的五百三十多户社员中，因为设立了十处幼儿园和托儿所，受托了80％以上的儿童，就使得过去受孩子拖累的三百七十三名妇女，参加了各项生产和服务性行业。青年妇女张大秀，从小参加生产，干活比棒小伙子一点不差，曾得过村里三次奖励。1954年她结了婚，因为要在家里作饭，接着又有了孩子，从此很少有机会参加劳动，从1955年起的三年中，每年所作劳动日不过二、三十个。公社成立后，她又心情愉快地展翅飞到了劳动中去大显身手。
    “一人生小孩，合家都担忧”，这是过去农村妇女临产时的紧张情形的写照。在农业社时期，虽然早已有了好些受过政府训练的新法接生员，但产妇还是在家里生小孩，对产妇的照顾也不够周到。现在，公社建立了几处产院，产妇们可以住进产院，既有专人照料她们，在红糖、小米、鸡蛋等营养方面还受到特殊的照顾，而且四十五天的产期休假中照旧可以领得工资。这个公社已经出生了一批小公民。据两个产院的统计，就接待了三十七名产妇住院，接生了二十八个男孩和九个女孩，大人小孩全都很健康。有一个孕妇聂英心，怀的是死婴，接生员为她取出了死婴，使她的身体健康没有受到损害。
    妇女们从心里把公社比作天堂，一致反映公社对她们的好处最多，因而个个心情舒坦，干劲冲天，先进的妇女集体单位和个人，不断地涌现出来。例如，打机井这工作十分艰巨，但在全社一千三百多名打井队员中，有六百三十多名是妇女；在最近获奖的五十五名模范打井队员中，有二十八名是妇女。由李秀安领导的妇女打井班，刻苦钻研，改进井锥，打穿了铁板砂层，打成的机井质量很好，被公社评为先进打井班，荣获了第一面打井红旗。
  新的一代在成长
    在公社办公所在地附近，有几排红瓦灰墙的建筑物，这是公社新办的农业学校。这所学校有教员十五名，内中六名是全国妇联的下放干部；有男女学生五百多人。目前学生们除分班学习初中文化课程外，还学习机务专业或园艺专业。机务专业由拖拉机站的技术干部讲授，果树专业由果树“土专家”讲授。
    公社还新办了一处初级中学班，学生一百三十六人，没有升学的高小毕业生，全部进了中学。
    原有小学的二十个班也扩大了，并增设了十六个班，学生由四千六百多人增加到五千五百多人，已占学龄儿童的99％，另外还有三百五十多个超过学龄的儿童，也进了学校。
    这些学校的最大特点：真正作到了学习与劳动相结合，大力培养着亦工亦农又有文化的新一代。农业学校的学生们，每周学习三天，劳动三天，休息一天。他们结合学习已办起了化肥厂、畜牧场、木工厂等十处劳动场所。中学生们每天农忙劳动三小时，农闲劳动一、二小时，他们曾为公社拾棉花二千亩，翻地一百二十亩，种麦一百五十亩等，受到了社员们的称赞。
              ※
    这里名叫“诗经村”，传说是毛苌讲述“诗经”的地方。今天，这个地方，生活在公社化幸福时代的人们，也用诗歌唱出了自己在新社会中的体会和感想的真情，歌颂人民公社的诞生，赞扬人民公社具有的强大的生命力。从公社建立到最近，社员群众创作和口述了大量诗歌，经过公社组织专人搜集整理，分订成册，现已刊印出了十四期，并定名为“新诗经”。
    春节快到了，公社将休假五天，社员们正酝酿举办一次盛大的赛诗大会，要尽情地把无比优越的人民公社再歌颂一番。
