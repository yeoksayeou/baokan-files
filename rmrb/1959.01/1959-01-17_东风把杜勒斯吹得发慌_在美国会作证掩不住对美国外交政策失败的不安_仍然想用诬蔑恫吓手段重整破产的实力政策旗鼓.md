Xinhua News Agency, January 15th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 14 regarding U.S. foreign policy. This meeting was arranged at the end of last year, when many senators, in light of a series of failures and setbacks in U.S. foreign policy around the world, demanded a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy.

The characteristic of Dulles's testimony this time is that he painted a gloomy picture of the world for the U.S. rulers with a feeling of fear and unease about the future. Dulles admitted that for the U.S. ruling group, "possibly for several years, the (world) situation is full of danger"; "we may face a more difficult period than we are accustomed to."

	Fear of the Socialist Camp's Strength
Dulles was primarily fearful of the vigorous development and strength of the socialist camp. He admitted that "the Soviet Union and Communist China are expanding their economic and industrial power at a very rapid pace," and their systems "make it possible to greatly accelerate infrastructure construction." He said, "A notable product of the Soviet Union's material achievements is its recent exploration of space. In this regard, the United States is still trying to 'catch up,' to catch up with the Soviet Union's first step."

As the cliché of the so-called "Communist military threat" is increasingly bankrupt, the U.S. ruling group has recently turned to spreading the lie of a "Communist economic offensive threat." Dulles said, "As the Communist economic power grows, we must anticipate and try to deal with further shocks to the economic structure of the free world from the Communist trade offensive."

Dulles warned U.S. senators not to underestimate the achievements and strength of the socialist camp countries. He said that underestimating their strength would be a fatal danger.

	Attacking the Social Systems of China and the Soviet Union
However, Dulles also made the usual shameless attacks on the social systems of China and the Soviet Union in his testimony. He was particularly hostile to China's "Great Leap Forward," saying it was "a night of forced labor," "a process of falling into the abyss of human enslavement," and delusionaly said that in the long run, the socialist camp "will encounter more and more difficulties." Dulles talked a lot about the "decline of Communist power" in the Western world. The Yugoslav revisionist group was praised and given high hopes by Dulles. He said that Yugoslavia has always "resisted Moscow." "Revisionism is an active force and a factor of turmoil. Moscow considers it a deadly enemy, and with good reason."

	Worried about the Development of National Independence Movements
Dulles believed that the second "challenge" facing the U.S. ruling group was the vigorous national independence movement. He said, "One of the most powerful forces at work in the world today is the movement for independence and freedom. This force is particularly prominent in Africa. In Africa, changes are rapid, and new countries appear almost overnight... Another such region is the southern part of our hemisphere. The people of Latin America are demonstrating their determination to control their own destiny. One dictatorial government after another is giving way to governments that are more responsive to the will of the people."

	Deceiving National Independent Countries to Win Favor
Dulles clearly knew that in these regions, the colonial forces of the United States, Britain, and France were the deadly enemies of the people fighting for independence, but he tried to provoke the relationship between nationalist countries and socialist countries with the so-called "Communist threat." He shamelessly said that "the leaders of the new freedom movements are increasingly seeing international communism as a threat to their freedom, rather than just something used by so-called 'Western imperialism' to scare people, as some people imagine." Regardless of the United States' ugly history of interfering in and suppressing national independence movements in Latin America and Asia and Africa in various ways, he stubbornly disguised the United States as a friend of the national independence movement, saying that the United States

	"Approves" the Independent Policies of National Independent Countries
	"Is sincere" and willing to support them "unconditionally," attempting to win the "favor" of national independent countries towards the United States.

	Advocating Continuing the Cold War Policy
When talking about the future foreign policy of the United States, Dulles said that in such a "constantly changing world," the foreign policy of the United States is unchanged. He tried his best to advocate that the United States should continue to implement its bankrupt "strength" policy,
	"Cold War" policy, and arms race policy. He said, "In order to gain an advantage in time, we will have to adhere to our approach. We will need the will of the whole country to maintain a firm attitude to deal with the threat of aggression and probing from the Soviet Union and China group." He emphasized the need to establish a "world order" favored by the United States and to consolidate "collective security systems" like "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization of American States, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." He said, "These treaties were originally designed as military alliances," "are no longer just military alliances. They are institutions for consultation, and this consultation is gradually reforming the society of free countries day by day." This shows that the United States is using these military alliances as tools for comprehensively interfering with and infiltrating its allies. However, Dulles admitted that there are many contradictions within these groups, and it is "never easy to complete (collective consultation) due to differences in the views of various countries."

	Concealing the U.S.'s Crimes of Armed Aggression
Although it is the United States that uses force and the threat of force in international relations, Dulles hypocritically put forward the so-called opposition to "using force and the threat of force to change the international status quo." In this regard, he brazenly portrayed the defeat of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the U.S.'s invasion of Lebanon and its disgraceful withdrawal, the U.S.'s threat of force and military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, and the current policy of the U.S., Britain, and France staying in West Berlin as "the United States and other countries in the free world have done many things through their actions to establish for themselves the principle of renouncing the use of aggressive force," as examples of "their opposition to making changes through force and the threat of force." And on these issues, who used force and the threat of force is irrefutable, and Dulles and his ilk cannot deny it.

Dulles finally said: "The concepts of the free world and communism are mutually opposed."
	"But this is not to say that there cannot be useful contacts and negotiations with the Communists. We have had many such contacts and negotiations." He mentioned that the United States is "dealing with the Soviets" on issues such as disarmament, not continuing nuclear testing, and preventing surprise attacks.
	"In Warsaw, we are negotiating with the Chinese Communists. We have expressed our willingness to negotiate on the German question." However, Dulles did not mention any changes in the U.S.'s stubborn and unreasonable stance on these issues.

	Demanding that the American People Endure Sacrifices
Dulles's testimony shows that he is inwardly at a loss as to whether the goals of U.S. foreign policy can be achieved. He said that the goals of U.S. foreign policy cannot be achieved in a few years, but require decades or even generations.

He said this is because the United States "only has less than 6% of the world's land and population." He called on the American people to "make any unusual sacrifices that may need to be made" in promoting U.S. foreign policy, and called on U.S. partners to "interdepend" economically with the United States. But he also worried that doing so would be met with greater opposition from the American people, because "the longer they have to bear this burden, the heavier this burden seems to become."

### 东风把杜勒斯吹得发慌  在美国会作证掩不住对美国外交政策失败的不安  仍然想用诬蔑恫吓手段重整破产的实力政策旗鼓

    东风把杜勒斯吹得发慌
    在美国会作证掩不住对美国外交政策失败的不安
    仍然想用诬蔑恫吓手段重整破产的实力政策旗鼓
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯14日在参议院外交委员会会议上就美国的外交政策作证。这个会议是在去年年底安排的，当时许多参议员鉴于美国外交政策在世界各地遭到一连串的失败和挫折，纷纷要求对美国的外交政策作全面的审查。
    杜勒斯这次证词的特征，是他以对未来充满恐惧和不安的心情，给美国统治者描绘了一幅阴暗的世界图景。杜勒斯承认，对美国统治集团说来，“可能是在若干年中，（世界）局势是充满危险的”；“我们可能面临一个比我们所习惯的更为困难的时期”。
  恐惧社会主义阵营强大
    杜勒斯感到恐惧的首先是社会主义阵营的蓬勃发展和强大。他承认，“苏联和共产党中国正在以很迅速的步伐扩展它们的经济和工业力量”，它们的制度“使得大大加速基本建设成为可能”。他说，“苏联物质成就的一个引人注目的产物是它最近对空间的探索。在这方面，美国仍然在设法‘赶上去’，赶上苏联先跑的一步。”
    由于所谓“共产党军事威胁”的滥调日益破产，美国统治集团最近又转而散布“共产党经济攻势威胁”的谎言。杜勒斯说，“随着共产党经济力量的强大，我们必须料想到并且设法对付共产党贸易攻势再对自由世界的经济结构的进一步冲击”。
    杜勒斯警告美国参议员们不要低估社会主义阵营国家的成就和力量。他说，如果低估它们的力量，那将是致命的危害。
  攻击中苏两国社会制度
    但是，杜勒斯在证词中同时又对中苏两国的社会制度进行照例的无耻攻击。他特别仇视中国的“大跃进”，说这是“强迫劳动的黑夜”，是“陷入奴役人类深渊的过程”，并且痴人说梦地说，从长远说来，社会主义阵营“将遇到越来越多的困难”。杜勒斯大谈在西方世界中“共产党力量在衰退”。得到杜勒斯夸奖和被寄予很大希望的是南斯拉夫修正主义集团。他说，南斯拉夫一直“抗拒莫斯科”。“修正主义是一股活跃的力量和动乱的因素。莫斯科认为它是一个死敌，是有理由的”。
  担心民族独立运动发展
    杜勒斯认为，摆在美国统治集团面前的第二个“挑战”是蓬勃兴起的民族独立运动。他说，“今天在世界上起作用的最强大的力量之一是争取独立和自由的运动。这种力量在非洲特别显著。在非洲，变化迅速，几乎一夜之间就出现新的国家……另一个这样的地区是我们半球的南部。拉丁美洲各国人民正在表明他们决心掌握自己的命运。一个又一个的独裁政府让位于比较顺应人民意志的政府。”
  骗取民族独立国家好感
    杜勒斯明明知道在这些地区中，美英法等国殖民势力是为独立而斗争的人民的死敌，但是，他却力图以所谓“共产主义威胁”来挑拨民族主义国家同社会主义国家的关系。他无耻地说什么“新的自由运动的领袖们越来越认为国际共产主义威胁它们的自由，而不是像某些人所想像那样，只是所谓‘西方帝国主义’拿来吓唬人的东西”。他不顾美国在拉丁美洲和亚非地区以各种方式干涉和镇压民族独立运动的丑恶历史，硬把美国化装成民族独立运动的朋友，说什么美国
  “赞成”民族独立国家的独立政策
  “是真诚的”并愿意“无条件地”支持它们，企图以此来骗取民族独立国家对美国的“好感”。
  鼓吹继续执行冷战政策
    在谈到美国今后的外交政策时，杜勒斯表示，在这样一个“不断变化的世界里”，美国的外交政策是不变的。他竭力鼓吹美国要继续执行它业已破产的“实力”政策，
  “冷战”政策和军备竞赛政策。他说，“为了从时间上得到好处，我们将不得不坚持我们的方针。我们将需要全国的意志来保持坚定态度，以对付来自苏联和中国集团的侵略威胁和试探”。他强调要建立美国所中意的“世界秩序”，要巩固“北大西洋公约组织、美洲国家组织、东南亚条约组织”等“集体安全制度”。他说，“这些条约原是主要作为军事联盟而设计的结构”，“已经不再仅仅是军事上的联盟了。它们是进行磋商的机构，这种磋商正一天天地逐步改革自由国家的社会”。这说明，美国正在利用这些军事联盟作为全面干涉和渗入它的盟邦的工具。但是，杜勒斯承认，在这些集团内部矛盾重重，由于“各国的看法不同，要完成
  （集体磋商）这一点总不是容易的”。
  掩饰美国武装侵略罪行
    虽然在国际关系中使用武力和武力威胁的正是美国，但是，杜勒斯却伪善地提出了所谓反对“使用武力和武力威胁来改变国际现状”。在这方面，他厚颜无耻地把英法侵埃战争中的败退，美国出兵侵略黎巴嫩及其不光彩的撤出，美国在台湾海峡地区的武力威胁和军事干涉以及目前美、英、法三国赖在西柏林不走的政策，说成是“美国和自由世界其他国家通过它们的行动，已经做了许多事情来为它们自己建立放弃使用侵略力量的原则”，是“它们反对通过武力和武力威胁来作出改变”的范例。而在这些问题上，究竟是谁使用了武力和武力威胁，铁证如山，是杜勒斯之流抵赖不了的。
    杜勒斯最后说：“自由世界和共产主义的概念是互相对立的”。
  “但是这不是说就不能同共产党人进行有益的接触和谈判。我们已有过许多这种接触和谈判。”他提到美国正在裁军、不继续核试验、防止突袭等问题上，“同苏联人打交道”。
  “在华沙，我们同中国共产党人在谈判。我们已经表示愿意就德国问题进行谈判。”但是，杜勒斯没有提到美国在这些问题上顽固而又无理的立场有任何改变。
  要求美国人民忍受牺牲
    杜勒斯的证词表明，他对于美国外交政策的目标是否能够达到，是内心茫然的。他说，美国外交政策的目标不是几年内就可以实现的，而是需要几十年或许甚至几个世代的时间。
    他说这是因为美国“仅仅拥有还不到世界上6％的土地和人口。”他呼吁在推行美国外交政策方面美国人民要“作出可能需要作出的任何不寻常的牺牲”，呼吁美国的伙伴同美国在经济上“互相依赖”。但是他又担心这样做将遭到美国人民更大的反对，因为“他们必须承担这种负担的时间越长，这种负担似乎就变得越重。”
