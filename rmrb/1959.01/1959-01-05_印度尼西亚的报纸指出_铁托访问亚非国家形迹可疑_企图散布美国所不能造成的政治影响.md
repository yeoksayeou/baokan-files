Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 4th: During Tito's visit to Indonesia, Indonesian newspapers offered varied commentary. Some newspapers welcomed Tito as a neutralist, while others accused Tito's visit of aiming to spread "political influence that the United States cannot achieve" and criticized him for not expressing support for Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian in a series of speeches.

    "Orient Star" pointed out that Tito's visit to Indonesia and other Asian and African countries might be to try to create political influence that the United States and other imperialist countries have not been able to create; that is to say, they have not been able to make Indonesia and Asian and African countries abandon their free and active policies and join the Western imperialist bloc.

    In pointing out that Tito was carrying out a Western mission, the newspaper said that Tito's "neutral policy" cannot affect Indonesia's free and active foreign policy.

    In an editorial on December 23, "Orient Star" said that not long ago, Yugoslavia promised to give Indonesia a loan, but at the same time, Yugoslavia itself received nearly 100 million U.S. dollars in loans from the United States. The editorial said that it is not surprising that people have such suspicions: Yugoslavia may be playing the role of a mediator for the United States, attempting to influence those backward countries that the United States cannot directly pull over, and preventing them from establishing any relationship with countries that oppose the United States.

    In its December 26th editorial, the newspaper compared Tito with President Sukarno. It pointed out that Sukarno hopes to liberate Indonesia from imperialist control; while Tito wants to make Yugoslavia subject to imperialist enticement. Sukarno strives to pursue an active and independent policy between two hostile blocs, while actively avoiding disputes and preventing war; while Tito has dragged Yugoslavia into the struggle between the two major blocs, which means that Tito has adopted a hostile attitude towards the socialist bloc, if we do not want to say that he is cooperating with the imperialist bloc. Sukarno does not refuse to cooperate with any country, nor does he refuse to accept assistance from any country—including imperialist countries—as long as their assistance does not hinder Indonesia's active and independent policy; while Tito cooperates with the imperialist bloc and accepts its assistance, he does not even consider whether such cooperation and assistance will produce political consequences that are hostile to the socialist bloc.

    Jakarta's "People's Daily" pointed out that Tito is a revisionist. In its December 30th editorial, the newspaper said that there are differences between Indonesia's and Yugoslavia's neutral policies; the former aims to liberate Indonesia from the imperialist camp, while the latter aims to separate Yugoslavia from the socialist camp. The editorial said that the difference between Indonesia's and Yugoslavia's foreign policies is also reflected in the fact that Yugoslavia has adopted an unfriendly attitude towards the socialist camp, while Indonesia has not adopted an unfriendly attitude towards the socialist camp. Jakarta's "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 3rd, saying that during Tito's visit to Indonesia, he did not actually express support for the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian.

    The newspaper pointed out that Tito did not actually mention this issue in his speeches in Indonesia. He only said in the joint communiqué issued with President Sukarno that colonial rule in West Irian is a "negative tendency."

    "Social Messenger" expressed praise for the content of the joint communiqué, but the newspaper expressed doubt about Tito's so-called execution of a "positive, independent or non-aligned" foreign policy, pointing out that Yugoslavia participated in the Balkan Pact group.

### 印度尼西亚的报纸指出  铁托访问亚非国家形迹可疑  企图散布美国所不能造成的政治影响

    印度尼西亚的报纸指出
    铁托访问亚非国家形迹可疑
    企图散布美国所不能造成的政治影响
    新华社雅加达4日电　在铁托访问印度尼西亚期间，印度尼西亚的报纸的评论是各种各样的。一些报纸把铁托当作中立主义者来欢迎，另一些报纸则指责铁托访问的目的是散布“美国所不能造成的政治影响”，并且指责他在一系列的演说中没有表示过支持印度尼西亚争取收复西伊里安的斗争。
    “东星报”指出，铁托到印度尼西亚和其他亚非国家访问，可能是为了设法造成美国和其他帝国主义国家所没有能够造成的政治影响，也就是说，它们没有能够使印度尼西亚和亚非各国放弃自由而积极的政策而加入西方帝国主义集团。
    这家报纸在指出铁托在执行西方的使命时说，铁托的“中立政策”不可能影响印度尼西亚的自由而积极的外交政策。
    “东星报”在12月23日的一篇社论中说，不久以前南斯拉夫曾经答应给予印度尼西亚一笔贷款，但是同时南斯拉夫自己却从美国那里得到了近一亿美元的贷款。社论说，人们产生这种怀疑是不足为奇的：南斯拉夫可能扮演美国的调解人的角色，企图影响那些美国不能直接拉过去的落后国家，并且使他们不同反对美国的国家建立任何关系。
    这家报纸在12月26日的社论中曾经把铁托和苏加诺总统作了一个对比。它指出，苏加诺希望把印度尼西亚从帝国主义的控制中解救出来；而铁托却想使南斯拉夫受帝国主义的诱使。苏加诺设法在两个敌对集团之间奉行积极的独立政策，同时积极地避免纠纷和防止战争；而铁托却把南斯拉夫牵涉到两大集团的斗争中去了，这意味着，铁托对社会主义集团采取了敌对的态度，假如我们不希望说他和帝国主义集团合作的话。苏加诺不拒绝和任何国家进行合作，也不拒绝接受任何国家——包括帝国主义国家在内所给予的援助，只要它们的援助不会妨碍印度尼西亚的积极的独立政策；而铁托却和帝国主义集团进行合作并接受它的援助，他甚至根本不考虑这种合作和援助是否会产生敌视社会主义集团的政治后果。
    雅加达“人民日报”指出，铁托是一个修正主义者。这家报纸在12月30日的社论中说，印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫的中立政策存在着不同的地方，前者要使印度尼西亚从帝国主义阵营那里解放出来，后者要使南斯拉夫同社会主义阵营分开。社论说，印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫的外交政策的不同还表现在，南斯拉夫对社会主义阵营采取了不友好的态度，而印度尼西亚并没有对社会主义阵营采取不友好态度。雅加达“人民日报”在3日发表社论说，在铁托访问印度尼西亚期间，他实际上并没有表示支持印度尼西亚人民争取收复西伊里安的斗争。
    这家报纸指出，铁托在印度尼西亚发表的演说中实际上没有提到这个问题，他只是在同苏加诺总统发表的联合公报上说，在西伊里安的殖民统治是一种“消极的倾向”。
    “社会使者报”表示赞扬联合公报的内容，但是这家报纸对铁托所谓的他也在执行“积极、独立或不加入集团”的外交政策表示怀疑，它指出，南斯拉夫参加了巴尔干公约集团。
