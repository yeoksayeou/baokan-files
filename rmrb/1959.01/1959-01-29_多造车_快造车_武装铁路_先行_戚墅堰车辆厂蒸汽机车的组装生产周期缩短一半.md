Produce More Vehicles, Produce Vehicles Faster, Arm the Railways to "Take the Lead"
    Qishuyan Vehicle Factory Cuts Steam Locomotive Assembly Cycle in Half
    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, January 28th dispatch) The workers and staff of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant are carrying out a technical revolution movement to accelerate the speed of vehicle manufacturing and provide the railway transportation with batches of new locomotives and vehicles. Since the beginning of this year, the assembly and production cycle of locomotives and vehicles in this factory has been significantly shortened. The assembly and production cycle of the JS (Jianshe, Construction) type steam locomotive has been shortened from an average of about ten days last year to five days, and a new record of four days has recently been created.
    This factory was originally a repair factory, and this year it began to undertake the task of manufacturing large numbers of locomotives and freight cars. In addition to manufacturing JS type steam locomotives, 2,000-horsepower electric transmission internal combustion locomotives, and 50-ton and 60-ton freight cars, it is also preparing to produce new types of locomotives and freight cars.
    "Produce more vehicles, produce vehicles faster, and ensure that railway transportation takes the lead" has become the action slogan of all the factory's workers and staff. They are carrying out technical revolutions extensively around the speedup of locomotive and freight car manufacturing. The boiler, the main frame, and the wheels are the three major components of a locomotive. In the past, these three major components all relied on cooperation from the Dalian, Changxindian, Sifang and other locomotive and rolling stock factories, as well as Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3. This year, the workers proposed that, in addition to relying on cooperation from fraternal factories, most of them should be manufactured by themselves. Steelmaking workers adopted the method of raising the threshold of the steelmaking furnace to increase the amount of smelting, and as a result, ten tons of molten steel were produced in one run on a three-ton electric furnace, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient steel for casting the main frame. Casting workers used earthen flat plates instead of iron flat plates, which solved the problem of the lack of sand box flat plates for casting long castings, and casted batches of main frames. Mechanical workers used cement and old iron plates to lengthen and widen an old gantry planer, which was used to process the main frame. The factory's ability to manufacture the three major components of wheels, boilers, and main frames has created favorable conditions for accelerating locomotive production.
    Shortening the assembly production cycle is the key to early delivery of locomotives and rolling stock. Whenever tens of thousands of large and small locomotive parts are concentrated in the locomotive workshop, the workers in more than a dozen assembly processes launch a full-scale attack, conduct joint operations, cooperate with each other, and support each other to carry out rush assembly. Each process closely cooperates, without missing a link, and mutually guarantees quality to prevent rework and repairs. The workers also continuously improve technology, and the locomotive assembly time has been greatly shortened.

### 多造车　快造车　武装铁路“先行”  戚墅堰车辆厂蒸汽机车的组装生产周期缩短一半

    多造车　快造车　武装铁路“先行”
    戚墅堰车辆厂蒸汽机车的组装生产周期缩短一半
    本报南京28日电　戚墅堰机车车辆厂职工开展技术革命运动，加快车辆制造速度，为铁路运输提供成批新的机车车辆。今年以来，这个厂的机车车辆组装生产周期显著缩短。建设型蒸汽机车的组装生产周期从去年的平均十天左右缩短到五天，最近还创造了四天的新纪录。
    这个厂原来是一个修理工厂，今年开始担负制造大批机车、货车的任务。除制造建设型蒸汽机车、两千马力的电力传动内燃机车和载重五十吨、六十吨的货车外，还准备生产新型机车、货车。
    “多造车、快造车，保证铁路运输当好先行官”，已成为全厂职工的行动口号。他们围绕加快机车、货车制造速度，广泛开展技术革命。锅炉、主车架、车轮是机车的三大部件，过去这三大部件全部依靠大连、长辛店、四方等机车车辆厂和上海钢铁三厂协作。今年工人们提出，除部分依靠兄弟工厂协作外，大部分由自己设法制造。炼钢工人采取筑高炼钢炉炉门槛的办法增加熔炼量，结果在三吨电炉上一次炼出了十吨钢水，克服了浇铸主车架钢水不够的困难。浇铸工人用土平板代替铁平板，解决了浇长铸件缺乏砂箱平板的问题，浇铸出成批的主车架。机械工人用水泥和旧铁板把一台旧龙门刨床接长加宽，用来加工主车架。厂内能够自造车轮、锅炉、主车架三大部件，为加速机车生产创造了良好的条件。
    缩短组装生产周期是机车车辆早出厂的关键。每当上万件大大小小的机车零件集中到机车车间的时候，十多道组装工序的工人全面出击，联合作战，互相协作，互相支援，进行突击组装。每道工序都紧密配合，一环不脱，互相保证质量，防止返工回修。工人们还不断改进技术，机车组装时间大大缩短。
