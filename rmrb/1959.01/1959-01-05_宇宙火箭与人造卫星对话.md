Dialogue Between Cosmic Rocket and Artificial Satellite
Guo Moruo

Rocket: Satellite comrade, Happy New Year!
Satellite: Happy New Year! Ah! You've arrived, Rocket comrade!
Rocket: I was afraid you were too lonely, so I flew up here too.
Satellite: Yes indeed! Ever since the first and second satellite comrades completed their missions, I've been waiting for you up here for a long time. Why did you only fly up today?
Rocket: I was also getting a little anxious waiting at home. You know, our style is different from that of the Americans. Our leaders and scientists are practical and realistic. They always want to be sure of reliability before they release us.
Satellite: That's right, that's how it is. But your arrival is perfectly timed. You are the biggest New Year gift for 1959. You fired the loudest salute for the 21st Party Congress and the magnificent seven-year plan for building communism.
Rocket: That is thanks to our Party, our scientists, and our great Soviet people.
Satellite: Yes, I believe peace-loving people all over the world are grateful. You are a signal of peace. You are flying to outer space at the second cosmic velocity, making the possibility of interstellar travel about to be realized. What an exciting thing to broaden one's mind!
Rocket: Comrade, you are the same. The rocket that launched you last year already told those warmongers—the dinosaurs of the twentieth century—that gunboat policy is long outdated, and nuclear blackmail cannot blackmail anyone!
Satellite: But your arrival is different again. We are only artificial Earth satellites, and you are about to become an artificial solar planet. The dinosaurs of the twentieth century should calm down a bit. Anyone with foresight has seen that the future of mankind lies in mankind controlling its own destiny, peaceful coexistence, mutual assistance, and common progress.
Rocket: Let's take it one step at a time! It may take a while for the dinosaurs to calm down. But their future is certain. If they don't change course soon, they will only become fossils.
Satellite: Good! That's perfectly said. I want to ask you, do you have any new news to bring?
Rocket: About our country? You probably know it all already, isn't it broadcast every day?
Satellite: That's right, I know. What about China, do you have any news?
Rocket: About China? The Soviet people are very concerned. I heard that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, there will be an even greater leap forward this year. I heard that steel production will increase from 11 million tons to 18 million tons, coal production will increase from 270 million tons to 380 million tons, grain production will increase from 750 billion catties to 1,050 billion catties, and cotton production will increase from 67 million dan to 100 million dan. …
Satellite: Ah, that's a real leap! The great liberation and Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people is truly a gospel of peace, increasing the strength of our peace camp.
Rocket: But it has made that Mr. Dulles in America very angry.
Satellite: Haha, are you talking about him, that number one dinosaur? I heard him cursing China on "Voice of America" a long time ago. He has cursed China three times recently. Aren't you interested?
Rocket: What?
Satellite: Mr. Dulles is also talking about morality and benevolence. He talked about Confucius, about the People's Commune, saying that the family system in China has been destroyed by the Chinese Communist Party. He is mourning there as if he has lost his parents.
Rocket: Yes, it's really interesting. In my opinion, Dulles is deliberately acting as a clown in a circus. He always likes to be verbose, trying to deceive people into cheering. In fact, the Chinese family system is not being destroyed but expanded. Isn't it said that the whole world will become a democratic family? Dulles is pretending to be stupid to deceive people.
Satellite: That's right, people like Dulles are all big liars. They also shout about God every day, but if there really was a God, they wouldn't shout about it. Doesn't it say that "the gate of heaven is very narrow"? Doesn't it say that "it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle"?
Rocket: But the kingdom of heaven on earth is already being established, and they certainly have no share in entering it. We are also starting to establish the kingdom of heaven in the sky. Comrade, God cannot be said to be nonexistent. Aren't the working people God?
Satellite: Good, we are all created by the new God! It's a pity we don't have much time to talk. Goodbye, I wish you a safe journey!
Rocket: Goodbye, I also wish you a safe journey! Let us each go our own way, striving for further guarantees for world peace and human happiness!

    宇宙火箭与人造卫星对话
    郭沫若
    火箭：卫星同志，新年恭喜！
    卫星：新年恭喜！呵！你来了，火箭同志！
    火箭：我怕你太寂寞，我也飞上来了。
    卫星：是呵！自从第一和第二两位卫星同志完成了任务之后，我一个人在天上等了你好久啦，你怎么今天才飞上来呢？
    火箭：我在家里也等得有些着急。你是知道的啦，咱们的作风和美国的可不同。咱们的领导人和科学家们是实事求是的，总要算得稳妥可靠了，才肯把我们放出来。
    卫星：对，是那样。可你来的真是时候，你是1959年的最大的新年献礼啦。你为第二十一次党代表大会和建设共产主义的雄伟的七年计划，放出了最响亮的礼炮。
    火箭：那要感谢咱们的党，咱们的科学家，咱们伟大的苏联人民。
    卫星：是的，我相信全世界爱好和平的人民都在感谢。你是和平的信号啦，你以第二宇宙速度飞往外层空间，使星际航行的可能性快要实现了，这是多么令人开扩心胸的事呵！
    火箭：同志，你也是一样。去年把你放射出来的火箭早就告诉了那些好战分子——二十世纪的恐龙：炮舰政策早就过时了，原子讹诈政策也讹诈不了谁！
    卫星：但你这一来可又不同。我们只是人造地球卫星，你将要成为人造太阳行星了。二十世纪的恐龙们是应该冷静一点的时候了。凡是有远见的人都已见到：人类的前途是人类自己掌握自己的命运，和平共处、相互协助、共同进步。
    火箭：一步一步地来吧！要让恐龙们冷静，可能还要一个时期。不过它们的前途是肯定了的，如果不及早转变，便只好成为化石。
    卫星：好！说得一点也不错。我倒要问你啦，你有没有什么新消息带来？
    火箭：关于咱们国家的？你想来都是知道的了，不是天天都有广播的吗？
    卫星：对啦，我是知道的。关于中国的啦，你可有没有什么消息？
    火箭：关于中国的吗？苏联人民都非常关心，我听说在去年1958年大跃进的基础之上，今年将有更大的跃进。听说钢的产量将由一千一百万吨增加到一千八百万吨，煤的产量将由二万七千万吨增加到三万八千万吨，粮的产量将由七千五百亿斤增加到一万零五百亿斤，棉的产量将由六千七百万担增加到一万万担。……
    卫星：呵，那真是飞跃啦！中国人民的大解放、大跃进真是和平的福音，使我们和平阵营增加了雄厚的力量。
    火箭：可是，却惹得美国的那位杜勒斯先生大光其火了。
    卫星：哈哈，你说他吗，那位头号恐龙。通过“美国之音”，我早听见他在骂中国，最近已经骂了三次。你不感兴趣吗？
    火箭：什么？
    卫星：杜勒斯先生也在讲道德、说仁义啦。他讲到孔夫子，讲到人民公社，说是中国的家庭制度被中国共产党破坏了，他如丧考妣地在那儿哀悼。
    火箭：是的，真是有趣得很。在我看来杜勒斯是有意在那儿演马戏团的丑脚。他总是爱饶舌，骗骗人的喝彩。其实中国的家庭制度不是被破坏而是被扩大了，不是说全世界将成为民主的大家庭吗？杜勒斯是在那儿装傻骗人。
    卫星：一点也不错，像杜勒斯之流都是一些大骗子。他们天天也在喊上帝，其实如果真是有上帝的话，他们就不会喊了。不是说“天国的门是很窄的”吗？不是说“有钱的人想进天国比骆驼穿过针眼还要难”吗？
    火箭：可是，地上的天国已经在建立了，他们要进去确是没有分的。天上的天国，我们也在开始建立了。同志，上帝也不能说没有，劳动人民不就是上帝吗？
    卫星：好呵，咱们都是新上帝创造出来的！可惜我们没有多的时间来讲话了，再见吧，祝你一路平安！
    火箭：再见，我也祝你一路平安！让我们各奔前程，为世界和平与人类幸福争取进一步的保障！
