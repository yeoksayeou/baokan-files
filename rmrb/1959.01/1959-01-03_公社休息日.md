    Commune Rest Day
    Ye Runtong

    The street is bustling,
    The street is bustling,
    Adorned with red and green, wearing new clothes.
    Crowded in front of the shops,
    Shop assistants are busy fetching goods.
    Old man Zhang, buys cigarettes,
    Grandson clamoring to eat candy;
    Sister-in-law Li, carefully examines,
    Tears off three yards of flowered cloth.
    Hurriedly out of the shop,
    Happily heading to the theater.

    The propaganda team's red flag flutters, better than the New Year,
    The streets and lanes are bustling with noise;
    Cotton-picking girls sing ditties,
    Cattle-raising old man strums the sanxian.
    Publicizing the superiority of the commune,
    Singing praises of the general line of construction;
    Singing makes the commune members applaud in unison,
    Singing makes everyone beam with joy.

    Reunion
    The setting sun is already sinking in the west,
    The sky is full of colorful clouds;
    Sister-in-law leaves the canteen,
    And brings the meal home.
    Every household's bowls and chopsticks clatter,
    Laughter spreads through the courtyard;
    Grandpa holds his grandson,
    Daughter-in-law is busy calling Mom;
    The whole family is happily reunited,
    Praising the commune together.
    We used to swallow chaff,
    Now we drink fish soup;
    After eating lunch,
    Electric lights shine all over the street.

    公社休息日
    叶闰桐大街上闹洋洋大街上，闹洋洋，披红戴绿换新装。商店门前挤，店员取货忙。张老汉，买香烟，孙儿嚷着要吃糖；李大嫂，细端详，扯了花布整三丈。急急忙忙出店门，喜喜哈哈上戏场。
  宣传队红旗飘飘赛过年，街头巷尾闹喧天；采棉姑娘唱小调，养牛老汉弹三弦。宣传公社优越性，高歌建设总路线；唱得社员齐喝采，唱得人人尽开颜。
  团　聚夕阳已西下，天空出彩霞；大嫂离食堂，饭菜领回家。户户碗筷响，笑声传院落；爷抱孙儿坐，媳妇忙喊妈；全家乐融融，齐把公社夸。从前咽米糠，如今喝鱼汤；吃罢下午饭，满街电灯亮。
