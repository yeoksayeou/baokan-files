Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense declared: On the morning of January 3rd, the Chiang troops on Jinmen indiscriminately bombarded peaceful residents in Shantou Village, Dadeng Island, causing significant casualties among residents and children. The people of the entire nation express extreme anger at this criminal act, which should have been severely punished. However, considering that this crime by the Jinmen Chiang troops may have been committed by a small number of extremely reactionary elements, the artillery units of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front today gave appropriate punishment to show leniency. At the same time, targets such as the wharves, airports, and command posts in Liaoluo Bay on Jinmen Island were not bombarded, in order to facilitate the Chiang troops' continued defense.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 7th Dispatch: The military and civilians on Dadeng Island on the Fujian Front recently mournfully commemorated the residents of Shantou Village who died as a result of the shelling by the Jinmen Chiang troops. They stated that they must give the Chiang troops the punishment they deserve.

On January 3rd, when the Jinmen Chiang troops indiscriminately shelled Dadeng Island, Xiaodeng Island, Weitou, Lianhe, Xiamen, and other places, they fired thirty shells at Shantou Village, Dadeng Island, killing and wounding forty-eight residents. Among the thirty-one deaths, fifteen were children aged one to six, three were children aged ten to fourteen, three were old women aged fifty to seventy, and ten were young men and women. Among the seventeen wounded, five were children over the age of twelve, and the rest were young adults and elderly people. Among the victims were children from the People's Commune's kindergartens and nurseries, and students who had returned to Dadeng Island from the mainland to celebrate the New Year. A young mother named Xu Mei and her two-month-old daughter died together. Zheng Dejin's family had a total of six members, and his wife, daughter-in-law, daughter, and two granddaughters were all killed, while Zheng Dejin himself was injured. Farmer Zheng Zongman's mother, wife, and three children were also killed.

At the memorial service, Qiu Shuangxi, the deputy head of Dadeng Township, said that from 1949 to the end of 1958, fourteen residents of Dadeng Island had been killed by Chiang troops' shells and bombs, and seventeen had been wounded. On January 3rd of this year, the Jinmen Chiang troops incurred another blood debt. We must transform grief into strength and avenge the dead. Major Feng Jingyuan of the artillery unit stationed on Dadeng Island, on behalf of the artillery and infantry units stationed on the island, expressed condolences to the deceased and condolences to the families of the victims. He said that the Jinmen Chiang troops' crime of shelling the peaceful residents of Shantou Village has aroused the infinite indignation of the troops stationed on the island, and the vast number of officers and soldiers are determined to give the Chiang troops the punishment they deserve. The families of the victims unanimously stated at the meeting that they would wipe away their tears, bury the bodies of their loved ones, vigorously carry out support-the-front work, support the People's Liberation Army in combat, and avenge their loved ones.

The command organs of the Fujian Front troops and the Nan'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Fujian Province also sent representatives to lay wreaths at the graves of the deceased and expressed their willingness to vigorously help the families of the victims solve difficulties in life and other aspects.

    我炮兵昨予蒋军适当惩罚
    新华社7日讯　国防部发言人宣称：金门蒋军在本月3日上午对我大嶝岛山头村和平居民滥施轰击，使居民和儿童蒙受重大伤亡。对此罪恶行为，全国人民表示极大的愤怒，本应给予严厉的惩罚。但是，考虑到金门蒋军这一罪行，可能系少数极端反动分子所为，故今日我福建前线的人民解放军炮兵部队，给予适当惩罚以示宽大。同时，对金门岛料罗湾的码头、机场和指挥部等目标，未予轰击，以利蒋军继续固守。
    新华社福建前线7日电　福建前线大嶝岛军民，最近沉痛追悼受到金门蒋军炮击而死亡的山头村居民，他们表示一定要给蒋军应有的惩罚。
    1月3日，金门蒋军向我大嶝岛、小嶝岛、围头、莲河、厦门等地滥施炮击时，向大嶝岛山头村打了三十发炮弹，打死打伤居民四十八人。在死亡的三十一人中，有一岁至六岁的儿童十五名，十岁至十四岁的儿童三名，五十到七十岁的老太太三名，还有青年男女十名。在受伤的十七人中，有十二岁以上的儿童五名，其余是青壮年和老人。在死难者中，有人民公社幼儿园、托儿所的孩子，有在大陆上读书回到大嶝岛过新年的学生；一位名叫许梅的年轻母亲，跟她诞生二个月的女孩死在一处；郑德金老汉家中共六口人，他的妻子、儿媳、女儿和两个孙女都被打死，郑德金本人负了伤；农民郑宗满的母亲、妻子和三个孩子，也都被打死了。
    在追悼大会上，大嶝乡副乡长丘双喜说，从1949年到1958年底，大嶝岛上的居民，有十四人被蒋军的炮弹和炸弹夺去了生命，有十七人被打伤。今年1月3日金门蒋军又欠下了这笔血债，我们要化悲痛为力量，为死者报仇。大嶝岛炮兵部队冯景元少校，在会上代表驻岛炮兵和步兵部队，向死难者志哀，慰问受难者家属。他说，金门蒋军炮击山头村和平居民的罪行，激起了驻岛部队的无限愤慨，广大官兵决心给予蒋军以应得的惩罚。死难者家属在会上一致表示，擦干眼泪，埋掉亲人的尸体，大力做好支前工作，支援人民解放军作战，为亲人报仇。
    福建前线部队指挥机关和中共福建省南安县委员会，也都派代表在死难人民的墓前献了花圈，并且表示要大力帮助受难者家属解决生活等方面的困难。
