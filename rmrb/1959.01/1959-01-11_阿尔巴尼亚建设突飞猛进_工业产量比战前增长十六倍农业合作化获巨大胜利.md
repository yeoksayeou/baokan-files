Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 10th: January 11th marks the 13th anniversary of Albania's formal declaration of the establishment of the People's Republic. On this national holiday, the Albanian people are proud of the victorious path they have traversed under the leadership of the Labor Party for more than a decade and look forward to the future of their motherland with confidence.

　　Before liberation, Albania was the most backward and impoverished agricultural and pastoral country in Europe. At that time, the country's productivity level was very low, and there was almost no industry in the country. After the fundamental reform of the social economy and the implementation of the national economic development plan after liberation, Albania was built into an agricultural-industrial country several years ago. As early as the end of the First Five-Year Plan in 1955, the proportion of industrial production in the country's total production had increased from 9.8% in 1938 before liberation to 43.5%. In the years since the establishment of the People's Republic, Albania's industrial production has been developing rapidly every year. Taking 1938 as 100, Albania's industrial production increased by 59% in 1947, more than 2.9 times in 1950, 11.5 times in 1955, and further increased to more than 17 times by the end of 1958. According to the national production plan, this year's total industrial output value will increase by 17% compared with last year. At present, many modern industrial enterprises have been established in the People's Republic. In addition to the fundamental reconstruction of many existing factories this year, some new factories and enterprises will also be completed and put into production.

　　The situation in agriculture is also quite encouraging. Before liberation, Albania's agricultural production technology and labor methods were very primitive. Now, many tractors, combines, and many other state-of-the-art agricultural machines rumbling in the fields have replaced heavy physical labor. Last year alone, the number of tractors in national agriculture increased by 37.5%. In terms of the socialist transformation of agriculture, by the end of October last year, the number of agricultural cooperatives nationwide had increased from 1,698 at the beginning of last year to 1,935, and the land they owned accounted for 76.2% of the country's cultivated land area, while the cultivated land owned by the entire socialist agriculture accounted for more than 80% of the country's total cultivated land area. Due to the development of agricultural cooperativization and the improvement of production technology, Albania's agricultural production has continued to rise to new heights for more than a decade. Compared with 1956, Albania's total agricultural output value increased by 25% in 1957. Last year, despite very poor natural conditions, agricultural production results were not bad. For example, by December 5 last year, the country had harvested 14,900 tons of cotton, an increase of 3% compared with the harvest in the same period in 1957. In terms of animal husbandry, from January to October last year, the number of cattle in the country increased by more than 18,000.

　　The development of production has brought an increasingly high standard of living to the Albanian people. Compared with 1939, Albania's total national income increased by nearly one time in 1957, and last year it increased by 15% compared with 1957. The increase in people's purchasing power can be seen from the increase in domestic commodity sales. Compared with the previous year, the national commodity circulation increased by 32% in 1958, and the commodities sold by the socialist trade sector, which accounted for more than 87% of the national trade volume, increased by nearly one-third. This year, the working people will get more goods than last year: macaroni and sugar will increase by 34%, milk will increase by 53%, cotton fabrics will increase by 13%, woolen fabrics will increase by 11.7%, and shoes will increase by 16.7%. The sales volume of valuable commodities such as radios, electrical appliances, bicycles, and clocks will also further increase.

　　At the same time, the Albanian people are now victoriously creating their own new socialist culture. In this country where more than 80% of the people were illiterate in the past, the cultural level of the people is increasing day by day, and cultural life is becoming more and more rich and colorful.

    阿尔巴尼亚建设突飞猛进
    工业产量比战前增长十六倍农业合作化获巨大胜利
    新华社地拉那10日电　11日是阿尔巴尼亚正式宣布成立人民共和国十三周年。在这个全民节日里，阿尔巴尼亚人民为他们十多年来在劳动党领导下走过的胜利道路感到自豪，并且满怀信心地瞻望着自己祖国的未来。
    解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲最落后、最贫困的农牧业国，那时，国家的生产力水平非常低，全国几乎没有什么工业。经过解放后社会经济的根本改革和发展国民经济计划的实行，阿尔巴尼亚几年以前就已建设成为农业—工业国。还在第一个五年计划结束时的1955年，工业生产在整个国家的生产中所占的比重就已由解放前1938年的9.8％增加到43.5％。在人民共和国成立以后的年代中，阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产年年都在迅速发展。以1938年为一百，1947年阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产增加了59％，1950年增加了二点九倍以上，1955年增加了十一点五倍，而到1958年年底又进一步增加到十七倍以上。根据国家生产计划，今年工业总产值还将比去年增加17％。目前，在人民共和国已经建立起了许多现代化的工业企业，今年除了对现有的许多工厂进行根本改建以外，还将有一些新的工厂企业建成和投入生产。
    农业方面的情况也是相当鼓舞人心的。解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产技术和劳动方法是非常原始的。现在，田野上隆隆滚动的许多拖拉机、联合机和其他许多最新式的农业机器已经代替了繁重的体力劳动，单去年一年，全国农业中的拖拉机台数就增加了37.5％。在农业的社会主义改造方面，去年10月底，全国农业合作社的数目已经从去年年初的一千六百九十八个增加到一千九百三十五个，它们拥有的土地已经占全国耕地面积的76.2％，而整个社会主义农业所拥有的耕地则占全国耕地总面积的80％以上。由于农业合作化的发展和生产技术的改进，十多年来，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产不断从高涨走向新的高涨。和1956年比较，1957年阿尔巴尼亚农业总产值增加了25％。去年，尽管自然条件非常不好，但农业生产结果并不坏。例如，到去年12月5日全国已收获了一万四千九百吨棉花，比1957年同期的收获量增加了3％。在畜牧业方面，从去年1月到10月，全国牛的头数就增加了一万八千多头。
    生产的发展给阿尔巴尼亚人民带来了越来越高的生活水平。和1939年比较，1957年阿尔巴尼亚国民收入总额增加了将近一倍，而去年又比1957年增加了15％。人民购买力提高的情况则可以从国内商品销售量的增长中看出来。和前一年比较，1958年全国商品流通量增加了32％，占全国贸易额87％以上的社会主义贸易部分所出售的商品差不多增加了三分之一。今年，劳动人民还将比去年获得更多的商品：通心粉和糖增加34％，牛奶多53％，棉织品多13％，毛织品多11.7％，鞋类多16.7％。无线电收音机、电气仪器、自行车、钟表等贵重商品的出售量也将进一步增加。
    同时，阿尔巴尼亚人民现在正在胜利地创造自己的新的社会主义文化。在这个过去80％以上的人是文盲的国家里，人民的文化水平在日益提高，文化生活越来越丰富多采。（附图片）
