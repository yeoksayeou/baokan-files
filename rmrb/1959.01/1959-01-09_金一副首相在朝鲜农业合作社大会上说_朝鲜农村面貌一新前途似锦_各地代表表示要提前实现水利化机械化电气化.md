Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: The Korean National Agricultural Cooperative Congress continued its session this afternoon. Korean Deputy Prime Minister Kim Il and many representatives spoke at the meeting. The heads of the Bulgarian and Vietnamese agricultural delegations delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

In his speech, Kim Il said that the victorious completion of agricultural cooperativization in Korea was three years ahead of schedule as planned by the Third Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. This is the greatest event that has occurred in Korea since the war. He said that thanks to the completion of agricultural cooperativization, favorable conditions have been created for the continued development of agriculture and the improvement of farmers' lives, and the position of the Workers' Party of Korea in the countryside has been further consolidated.

Kim Il said that in the five years since the war, the face of the Korean countryside has been completely renewed. Grain production in 1958 reached 3.7 million tons, which is 1.4 times the highest pre-war level. 8,000 schools and more than 40,000 new cultural residences have been built in rural areas.

Kim Il emphasized the importance of achieving irrigation, mechanization, and electrification in rural areas. He said that the enthusiasm of farmers to achieve irrigation is extremely high. More than 10,000 irrigation projects started last winter have been completed by 85%. These projects can expand the irrigated area by 300,000 chongbo (approximately 15 mu per chongbo).

Kim Il also focused on the issue of planting less and harvesting more, and increasing yield per unit area.

Kim Il said that the tasks for the agricultural sector put forward by Premier Kim Il-sung to the congress are a grand blueprint for the future development of Korean agriculture. Korean farmers will definitely be able to overfulfill the task of reaching 5 million tons of grain production this year.

Other representatives unanimously supported Kim Il-sung's report in their speeches. They expressed their intention to achieve irrigation, mechanization, and electrification of the countryside ahead of schedule, and to implement deep plowing, close planting, and more fertilization to increase yield per unit area.

Gao Changnan, the director of the China-Korea Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, said at the meeting that this cooperative will be able to complete a large-scale irrigation project before March of this year, achieving irrigation two years ahead of schedule. He said that by 1960, they will be able to achieve mechanization, and they will strive to increase rice production to an average of 25 tons per chongbo, which is five times more than this year.

Marko Dakov, head of the Bulgarian agricultural delegation, extended congratulations to the congress on behalf of all Bulgarian agricultural cooperative members. He said that the Bulgarian people are proud of the Korean people's completion of agricultural cooperativization in three or four years after the war. The completion of agricultural cooperativization in Korea has contributed to strengthening the socialist camp. He said that the Bulgarian delegation will learn from the good experience of Korean farmers in building water conservancy projects and growing cotton.

Tran Van Dai, head of the Vietnamese agricultural delegation, addressed the congress and said that the Vietnamese people are happy to see the Korean people advancing rapidly on the Chollima horse. He said that the Vietnamese delegation will learn from Korea's experience in implementing socialist transformation of agriculture.

The meeting was divided into eight groups for discussion on the 7th and this morning. One hundred and twenty representatives spoke at the group meetings. They unanimously supported Kim Il-sung's report and were determined to complete the task of producing 5 million tons of grain this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: The electrification of the Korean countryside is progressing rapidly. At present, 67% of the villages (i.e., townships) and 49% of the farm households in northern Korea have electricity.

In the five years since the war, more than 2,000 kilometers of transmission lines have been erected in the Korean countryside, and 220,000 kilovolt-amperes of transformers have been installed. This year, the electricity used for pumping water in the Korean countryside will reach more than ten times that of 1949 before the war.

The movement to build small power stations independently launched by agricultural cooperatives in various places recently has further promoted the electrification of the countryside. The Korean people are determined to electrify every village and household in the northern Korean countryside within a year or two and complete the electrification of the countryside. The movement for agricultural cooperatives to build their own small power stations in various places was launched last October after the Workers' Party of Korea issued a call to launch a nationwide movement to increase production and save electricity. At present, South Hamgyong Province has built 165 small power stations, and Jagang Province and Kangwon Province have built 163 and 75 respectively. As a result, every village in these three provinces has electricity. In the mountain villages in the deep mountains and dense forests, electric lights are shining everywhere, and electricity is used to replace manpower for irrigation, threshing, rice milling and other labor.

With the development of electrification, 92% of the villages in northern Korea have telephones and 85% of the villages have wired broadcasting.

    金一副首相在朝鲜农业合作社大会上说
    朝鲜农村面貌一新前途似锦
    各地代表表示要提前实现水利化机械化电气化
    新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜全国农业合作社大会今天下午继续举行大会，朝鲜内阁副首相金一和许多代表在会上发言。保加利亚和越南两国农业代表团团长向大会致了祝词。
    金一在发言中说，朝鲜农业合作化的胜利完成，比朝鲜劳动党第三次大会所预定的时间提前了三年，这是朝鲜在战后发生的最伟大的事件。他说，由于完成了农业合作化，为继续发展农业、改善农民生活创造了有利条件，朝鲜劳动党在农村中的阵地更加巩固了。
    金一说，战后五年来，朝鲜农村的面貌已经焕然一新，1958年谷物产量达到三百七十万吨，达到战前最高水平的一点四倍。农村中建立了八千所学校和四万多幢新的文化住宅。
    金一强调了农村实现水利化、机械化、电气化的重要性。他说，目前农民实现水利化的热情极为高涨，去冬开始兴建的一万多项灌溉工程，已经完成了85％。这些工程可以扩大土地灌溉面积三十万町步（一町步约合十五市亩）。
    金一还着重谈到了少种多收和提高单位面积产量的问题。
    金一说，金日成首相向大会提出的今后农业部门的任务，是朝鲜农业今后发展的宏伟的蓝图，朝鲜农民今年一定能够超额完成使粮食产量达到五百万吨的任务。
    其他代表在发言中一致拥护金日成的报告。他们表示要提前实现农村的水利化、机械化、电气化，实行深耕、密植、多施肥、提高单位面积产量。
    朝中友谊农业社社长高昌男在大会上说，这个社在今年3月以前就能修成一个大规模的灌溉工程，提前两年实现水利化。他表示，到1960年他们就可以实现机械化，并且要争取水稻产量平均每町步达到二十五吨，比今年增加五倍。
    保加利亚农业代表团团长马科·达科夫以保加利亚全体农业社员的名义向大会表示祝贺。他说，保加利亚人民为朝鲜人民在战后三、四年内完成农业合作化而感到自豪，朝鲜农业合作化的完成，为增强社会主义阵营的力量作出了贡献。他说，保加利亚代表团将学习朝鲜农民兴修水利和种棉花的良好经验。
    越南农业代表团团长陈文大向大会致词说，越南人民看到朝鲜人民跨上千里马飞速前进，感到高兴。他说，越南代表团将学习朝鲜实行农业社会主义改造的经验。
    会议在7日和今天上午分成八个小组进行了讨论。有一百二十名代表在小组会上发言。他们一致拥护金日成的报告，并且决心在今年完成生产五百万吨粮食的任务。
    新华社平壤7日电　朝鲜农村的电气化进展很快。目前朝鲜北部农村中已有67％的里（即乡）、49％的农户用上了电。
    战后五年来，朝鲜农村中已经架设了二千多公里长的输电线路，安装了二十二万千伏安的变压器。今年朝鲜农村中用于抽水的电力将达到战前1949年的十倍以上。
    最近各地农业社展开的自建小型发电站的运动，进一步促进了农村的电气化。朝鲜人民决心要在一、两年内使朝鲜北部农村村村户户用上电，完成农村的电气化。朝鲜各地农业社自建小型发电站的运动是在去年10月朝鲜劳动党发出展开全民性增产节约电力的运动后展开的。现在，咸镜南道已经建设了一百六十五个小型发电站，慈江道和江原道分别建设了一百六十三个和七十五个。这样一来，这三个道中的每个里都有了电。深山密林里的山村中也到处电灯辉煌，也都用电力来代替人力进行灌溉、打谷、碾米等劳动。
    随着电气化的发展，朝鲜北部农村中已有92％的里有了电话，85％的里有了有线广播。
