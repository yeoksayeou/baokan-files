Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, arrived in Hanoi by plane this afternoon from India to begin a friendly visit to Vietnam lasting approximately five days.

Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Ministers Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Pham Hung, Politburo member of the Vietnam Workers' Party Central Committee Hoang Van Hoan, government ministers, and more than 2,500 citizens warmly welcomed the delegation at the airport. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.

Prime Minister Grotewohl, accompanied by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, reviewed the guard of honor and then met with the welcomers. As the distinguished guests passed through the welcoming lines, enthusiastic cheers, applause, and the singing of the "Thälmann Song" resounded everywhere, and the welcoming masses presented bouquets of flowers to the guests.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a speech at the airport, expressing a warm welcome to the delegation's visit to Vietnam.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regard the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic as an event of great significance. He said that the delegation's visit will further strengthen the friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the German and Vietnamese people.

Prime Minister Grotewohl said in a speech amidst cheers: The German Democratic Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are both part of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the two countries are working together to build socialism. For this purpose, the people of the two countries are forever closely bound together by unbreakable fraternal friendship, and no one can shake this friendship built on the principles of socialist internationalism.

Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out: Vietnam, like Germany and Korea, is being divided by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. South Vietnam, like West Germany and South Korea, has become an imperialist war base against the will of the entire Vietnamese people. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are undermining the Potsdam Agreement in Germany, the Armistice Agreement in Korea, and the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. However, our struggle is bound to be victorious because we have the fraternal support of the people of all countries in the socialist family and the peace-loving people of the world.

Prime Minister Grotewohl concluded by saying: We believe that the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to Vietnam will make the fraternal relations between the two countries closer and more solid, and will help to consolidate the unity of the socialist camp and defend peace. His speech was interrupted by warm applause many times.

Subsequently, Prime Minister Grotewohl, accompanied by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, boarded an open car and entered Hanoi city, where he was welcomed by 30,000 people lining the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: Prime Minister Pham Van Dong held a grand banquet at the guesthouse tonight to entertain Prime Minister Grotewohl. President Ho Chi Minh attended the banquet.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered speeches at the banquet successively. They unanimously condemned the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its pawns to undermine the cause of German and Vietnamese unification, and pointed out that the just struggle of the people of the two countries for the unification of their motherlands will surely achieve final victory.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the unification of Germany is a matter for the German people and must be resolved by the German people, and foreign interference is not allowed. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should sit down and discuss the formation of a confederation including the two Germanys, which is the most reasonable way to solve the problem of German unification. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly support the proposals put forward by the Soviet government on the Berlin issue and the signing of a German peace treaty.

Prime Minister Grotewohl said that we must tell all the enemies who want to hinder our cause, whether they are Adenauer or Ngo Dinh Diem, Syngman Rhee or other pawns, that we will do everything in our power and take all measures to defend our country and achieve our unification at any time.

    格罗提渥率代表团到河内访问
    德越总理同声谴责美国破坏两国统一事业
    新华社河内17日电　以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团今天下午乘机从印度到达河内，开始对越南进行为期约五天的友好访问。
    越南总理范文同、副总理长征、武元甲、范雄，越南劳动党中央政治局委员黄文欢，政府各部部长和两千五百多市民到机场上热烈欢迎代表团。前往机场欢迎代表团的还有各国驻越南外交使节。
    格罗提渥总理由范文同总理陪同检阅了仪仗队，然后同欢迎者见面。当贵宾们走过欢迎的行列时，到处响起了热烈的欢呼声、掌声和“台尔曼颂歌”的歌声，欢迎的群众把一束束的鲜花献给了贵宾。
    范文同总理在机场上致词，表示热烈欢迎代表团对越南的访问。
    范文同总理说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府把德意志民主共和国政府代表团的访问，看作是一件具有重大意义的事件。他说，代表团的访问，将进一步加强德国和越南人民之间的友谊和互助合作的关系。
    格罗提渥总理在欢呼声中发表讲话说：德意志民主共和国和越南民主共和国都是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的一部分，两国正在为建设社会主义而共同奋斗。由于这个目的，两国人民永远被牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊密切地结合在一起，谁也不能动摇这种建立在社会主义国际主义原则上的友谊。
    格罗提渥总理指出：越南同德国和朝鲜一样，正在被美帝国主义和它的走狗所分裂。南越也同西德和南朝鲜一样，已经变成违反全越南人民意志的帝国主义的战争基地。美帝国主义和它的走狗在德国破坏波茨坦协定，在朝鲜破坏停战协定，在越南破坏日内瓦协议。但是，我们的斗争是一定会取得胜利的，因为我们得到社会主义大家庭各国人民和世界爱好和平人民的兄弟般的支援。
    格罗提渥总理最后说：我们相信，德意志民主共和国政府代表团对越南的访问，将使两国兄弟般的关系更加密切和巩固，并且有助于巩固社会主义阵营的团结和保卫和平。他的讲话多次被热烈的掌声打断。
    随后，格罗提渥总理在范文同总理的陪同下登上敞篷汽车进入河内市区，沿途受到三万群众的夹道欢迎。
    新华社河内17日电　范文同总理今天晚上在迎宾馆举行盛大宴会，招待格罗提渥总理。胡志明主席出席了宴会。
    范文同总理和格罗提渥总理在宴会上先后发表讲话。他们一致谴责美帝国主义和它的爪牙破坏德国和越南统一事业的阴谋，并且指出，两国人民为统一祖国而进行的正义斗争必将取得最后胜利。
    范文同总理说，德国的统一是德国人民的事情，必须由德国人民来解决，不允许外国干涉。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为，德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国的代表应该坐下来商谈，从而成立一个包括两个德国的邦联，这是解决德国统一问题的最合理的道路。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决支持苏联政府就柏林问题和签订对德和约问题所提出的建议。
    格罗提渥总理说，我们必须告诉一切想阻挠我们的事业的敌人，这些人不管是阿登纳或者是吴庭艳，不管是李承晚或者是其它的爪牙，我们无论什么时候都尽一切力量和采取一切措施来保卫我们的国家和实现我们的统一。
