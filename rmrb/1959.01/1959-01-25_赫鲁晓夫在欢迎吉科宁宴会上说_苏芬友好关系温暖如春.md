Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: TASS reports: Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev said at a banquet in Leningrad on January 23rd, held to welcome Finnish President Urho Kekkonen, that our meeting and visit demonstrate that although the Soviet-Finnish border lies in the North, our two countries maintain good relations as warm as spring.

Khrushchev continued, in recent years, our two countries have formed friendly relations, which are improving year by year. Economic ties are strengthening, trade is conducted on a good foundation, and cultural exchanges are expanding.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government is always concerned with continuing to improve Soviet-Finnish relations. He said that we hope to be friends with the Finnish people and value their interests. The Soviet side is willing to realize all matters agreed upon by both parties during the Finnish President's visit to Moscow last year.

Khrushchev said to President Kekkonen: We highly value your efforts in strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland.

Recalling Soviet-Finnish relations, Khrushchev said that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, signed in 1948 and extended for another twenty years in 1955, laid the foundation for this relationship. All obstacles hindering the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries have been removed.

Khrushchev said that later, a situation emerged that began to damage the development of our friendship. He said this situation was formed with the Fagnholm government in power. Khrushchev pointed out that standing behind him were Donner and his follower Leskinen, as well as other well-known people who were hostile to the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that Finland now has a government headed by Sukselainen. We hope that this government will promote the strengthening of friendship between the Finnish and Soviet peoples, and promote the further development of economic, political, and cultural ties between the two countries.

Speaking about Soviet-Finnish trade, Khrushchev said that some people in Finland hope to sell us more goods and buy fewer goods from us, which is difficult to do. He said that the quantity of goods we buy from you depends on the quantity of goods you buy from us. I think you can understand this.

Khrushchev said that we do not have US dollars, and the United States pursues a discriminatory policy and does not trade with us. But we are not worried about this. It should be said that the United States' policy is failing. The ruling circles of the United States believe that they can use trade to hinder our country's economic development and hinder our country's scientific and technological development. But what is the result? The Soviet Union was the first to launch artificial earth satellites, and decided to further explore the universe, launching rockets towards the moon, creating artificial planets. This illustrates the high level of Soviet science and technology. I think Americans will also build rockets and launch rockets. However, the difference is that they will launch, while we have already launched. Of course, our science and technology will never stand still in the future.

In his speech, Khrushchev also emphasized that the Soviet people hope to maintain sincere friendship and the best relations with Finland. He said that we hope that our relations with Finland will be a good example of good relations between socialist countries and countries where the social system is based on non-socialist foundations.

Khrushchev believes that those who say that the Soviet Union has any aggressive plans against Finland are consistent slanderers of the Soviet Union and Finland, and are enemies of the Soviet Union and Finland.

Khrushchev emphasized that Finland's internal system is Finland's internal affair. Khrushchev expressed his belief that the majority of the people in this country understand and cherish the significance of friendship between the two countries and strive to strengthen this friendship.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that a friendly exchange of views in Leningrad will promote the further development and strengthening of Soviet-Finnish relations.

Finnish President Urho Kekkonen said in his reply at the banquet that the vast majority of the Finnish people hope to develop good relations between Finland and the Soviet Union, and are working to achieve this goal.

Kekkonen said that he believes that Khrushchev's speech shows that Finnish-Soviet relations can be developed on the basis of cordiality and great trust, and on the basis of the talks held in May last year. Kekkonen emphasized that the Finnish people find Khrushchev's speech very valuable.

Kekkonen emphasized that we in Finland sincerely hope that there will never be any distrust in the relations between our two peoples.

Among those present at today's banquet on the Soviet side were Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev, and others. On the Finnish side were Minister of Trade and Industry K. T. Kalsiainen and Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Eero A. Wuori, and others.

    赫鲁晓夫在欢迎吉科宁宴会上说
    苏芬友好关系温暖如春
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫1月23日在列宁格勒举行的招待芬兰共和国总统吉科宁的宴会上说，我们的会见和访问表明，虽然苏联同芬兰的国界是在北方，但是我们两国却保持着温暖如春的良好关系。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，近几年来，我们两国之间形成了友好关系，这种关系正在一年年地改善，经济联系在加强，贸易正在良好的基础上进行，文化联系正在扩大。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联政府始终关心继续改善苏芬关系。他说，我们希望同芬兰人民友好，并且重视他们的利益。苏联方面愿意实现芬兰共和国总统去年访问莫斯科时双方所商定的一切事宜。
    赫鲁晓夫向吉科宁总统说：我们非常珍视您在加强苏联同芬兰友好关系方面的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫在追述苏芬关系时说，1948年签订的、1955年又延长有效期二十年的苏芬友好合作互助条约为这种关系奠定了基础。妨碍两国发展友好合作的一切障碍都已消除。
    赫鲁晓夫说，但是后来又出现了开始损害我们友谊发展的局面。他说，这种局面是随着法格霍姆政府当权而形成的。赫鲁晓夫指出，站在他的背后的，是唐纳及其追随者勒斯基宁以及其他一些著名的敌视苏联的人。
    赫鲁晓夫说，芬兰现在成立了以苏克舍拉宁为首的政府。我们希望这个政府将会促进芬兰和苏联两国人民友谊的加强，促进两国经济、政治和文化联系的进一步发展。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏芬贸易时说，芬兰某些人士希望多卖给我们商品，而少买我们的商品，这是很难做到的。他说，我们购买你们的商品的数量取决于你们购买我们的商品的数量。我想，这是你们可以理解的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们没有美元，美国奉行歧视政策，不和我们进行贸易。但是我们并不为此担心。应该说，美国的政策正在遭到破产。美国统治集团认为它们能用贸易来阻挠我国的经济发展，阻挠我国的科学和技术发展。可是，结果怎样呢？苏联最先发射了人造地球卫星，并决定进一步探索宇宙，向月球方向发射了火箭，创造了人造行星。这说明苏联科学和技术的高度水平。我想，美国人也将制造火箭和发射火箭。然而区别在于，他们将发射，而我们已经发射了。当然，今后我们的科学和技术决不会停留在原地不动。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还强调指出，苏联人希望同芬兰保持真诚的友谊和最良好的关系。他说，我们希望同芬兰的关系足以成为社会主义国家和社会制度建立在非社会主义基础上的国家之间的良好关系的榜样。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，那些说苏联对芬兰抱有什么侵略计划的人是对苏联和芬兰的一贯的造谣中伤者，是苏联和芬兰的敌人。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，芬兰的内部制度是芬兰人民的内政。赫鲁晓夫表示，相信这个国家大多数的人民都了解和珍视两国友好的意义并尽力使这种友谊得到加强。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，在列宁格勒友好地交换意见，将促进苏芬关系的进一步发展和加强。
    芬兰共和国总统吉科宁在宴会上致答辞说，绝大多数芬兰人民都希望发展芬苏两国的良好关系，并且正在致力于实现这个目的。
    吉科宁说，他认为，赫鲁晓夫的讲话表明了芬苏两国关系能够在亲切和非常信任的基础上和在去年5月举行的会谈的基础上得到发展。吉科宁强调指出，芬兰人对赫鲁晓夫的讲话感到十分可贵。
    吉科宁强调说，我们在芬兰就衷心希望在我们两国人民之间的关系中永远不会出现不信任的情况。
    出席今天宴会的，苏联方面有苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯、对外贸易部部长帕托利切夫等人。芬兰方面有工商部部长卡尔西莱宁和芬兰驻苏大使沃里等人。
