Comrades, dear comrades and friends:

On behalf of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to you and all Chinese comrades and friends for the extremely sincere and fraternal hospitality we have received during our visit to your beautiful country.

During its friendly visit to the People's Republic of China, the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic gained unforgettable impressions of the great strength and remarkable achievements of the Chinese working people in socialist construction.

The meeting of representatives of the first German worker-peasant state and the People's Republic of China once again demonstrated the solidarity of the powerful socialist camp and once again helped to further deepen and consolidate the friendly and fraternal relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. Our talks have shown this; the talks have been reflected in our joint statement. During our visit to the People's Republic of China, we also saw the brilliance, patriotism, and indomitable determination shown by the Chinese people in the struggle against the conspiracies and provocations of the American imperialists, and once again expressed our full agreement with the just position of the Chinese people.

The working people of the German Democratic Republic are also engaged in socialist construction with victorious confidence and in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

Now, as the moment of parting with Chinese comrades and friends has arrived, I would like to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people once again. Thank you to the Chinese people for the great support given to the working people of the German Democratic Republic in their socialist construction, in their struggle for the peaceful and democratic unification of their motherland, and in their struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

The German Democratic Republic will always stand firmly on the side of People's China as a loyal friend.

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany!

Long live the invincible socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live the great and heroic Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong!

Long live world peace!

Goodbye!

    格罗提渥总理的讲话亲爱的同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我代表德意志民主共和国政府代表团向您和全体中国同志和朋友对我们在你们美丽的祖国访问期间所给予的极其真诚和兄弟般的款待表示深切的感谢。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国友好访问期间，对中国劳动人民在社会主义建设中的伟大力量和卓越成就获得了难忘的印象。
    第一个德意志工农国家的代表和中华人民共和国代表的聚会，再一次显示了强大的社会主义阵营的团结一致，并且再一次有助于进一步加深和巩固德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友好和兄弟般的关系。我们的会谈表现了这一点；会谈已在我们的联合声明中得到反映。我们在中华人民共和国访问期间同时也看到了中国人民在反对美帝国主义者的阴谋和挑衅的斗争中所表现的光辉和爱国主义和不屈不挠的决心，并再一次地表示完全赞同中国人民的正义立场。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民也满怀着胜利信心，以无产阶级国际主义的精神进行着社会主义建设。
    现在，当我们同中国同志和朋友分别的时刻来到的时候，我愿意特别向中国人民再一次表示真诚和衷心的感谢。感谢中国人民在德意志民主共和国劳动人民进行社会主义建设，争取和平民主统一他们祖国和争取缔结对德和约的斗争中所给予的巨大支持。
    德意志民主共和国将永远毫不动摇地作为忠实的朋友站在人民中国的一边。
    德中两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义阵营万岁！
    伟大英勇的中国人民和以毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    再见！
