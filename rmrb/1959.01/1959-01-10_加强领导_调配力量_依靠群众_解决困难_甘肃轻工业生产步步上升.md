    Strengthening Leadership, Deploying Forces, Relying on the Masses, Solving Difficulties
    Gansu's Light Industrial Production Rises Step by Step
    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 9th) Gansu Province, while developing heavy industry, is also focusing on light industry to produce more and better daily necessities to further meet the needs of urban and rural people.
    Currently, all light industrial departments in the province are overcoming the difficulties of low equipment production capacity and the shortage of some raw materials, launching a mass production upsurge. The output of paper, sugar, soap, uniform cloth, leather, alcohol, leather shoes, cigarettes, dry powder, etc., is rising step by step.
    Since the province launched the mass steelmaking campaign in the third quarter of last year, some workers were transferred from the light industry system to participate in steel and iron smelting, and transportation was also delayed for some light industrial raw materials. Giving way to steel was correct. However, because some people ignored the spirit of both giving way and leaping forward, the output of some light industrial products declined. This one-sided understanding was completely clarified after the spirit of the Central Industrial Secretaries' Conference was conveyed, and the idea of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward" was greatly promoted.
    Party organizations at all levels in Gansu have strengthened leadership in the production of living materials. After completing the annual steel production tasks ahead of schedule, each special district, on the premise of not affecting next year's steel production tasks, transferred tens of thousands of laborers from the steel front to strengthen the production of sugar making, paper making, food processing, etc., and squeezed out some equipment manufacturing forces to rush-manufacture hundreds of sets of small equipment for newly built light industrial factories. The inspection teams organized by the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and the Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee supervised and inspected factories that failed to complete their production plans. The Lanzhou Cigarette Factory failed to complete its plan from August to October last year. After the inspection team helped solve the difficulties, it overfulfilled the plan in early November, and the output increased by about half compared with the same period in October. The Lanzhou Municipal Party Committee also tried to allocate electric motors so that the newly installed paper machine in the Cultural Paper Mill could start production as soon as possible.
    In the process of accelerating the production of light industrial products throughout the province, difficulties have been encountered in terms of insufficient equipment capacity and raw material supply. Because the party committees at all levels resolutely followed the road of relying on the masses, the difficulties are being solved one by one, and production is rising day by day. Because the power of the people's communes in the beet-producing areas was mobilized, more than 200 indigenous sugar factories were established before the large-scale mechanized sugar factories were built. These factories used choppers to cut silk and iron pots to boil sugar. Although the equipment was simple, the total daily production capacity was as high as 100 tons, and they could produce both white sugar and brown sugar. The people's communes in pastoral areas have also built a number of dry goods processing factories, using indigenous methods to manufacture dry powder. Before a new batch of mechanized paper mills were put into production, party committees at all levels mobilized workers to make simple paper machines with wood and started production with indigenous methods. The Lanzhou Thermos Factory, in the absence of the important raw material soda ash, launched a mass "drought resistance" campaign. On the one hand, it collected local alkali to replace soda ash as raw material, and on the other hand, it collected broken glass and used the alkali contained in broken glass as raw material, which not only maintained production, but also increased output compared with the past. The Lanzhou Soap Factory tried every means to use the leftover oil from casing factories, slaughterhouses, bone fertilizer factories, and oil extraction factories as raw materials to overcome the difficulty of lacking hydrogenated fat. In the past ten days or so, the output has increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last month.

### 加强领导　调配力量　依靠群众　解决困难  甘肃轻工业生产步步上升

    加强领导　调配力量　依靠群众　解决困难
    甘肃轻工业生产步步上升
    本报兰州9日电　甘肃省在发展重工业的同时大抓轻工业，以便生产更多更好的生活用品，进一步满足城乡人民的需要。
    现在，全省各轻工业部门正在排除设备生产能力低和部分原材料不足的困难，掀起一个群众性的生产热潮。纸、糖、肥皂、制服呢、皮革、酒精、皮鞋、卷烟、干粉等产量正在步步上升。
    自去年第三季度全省各地开展全民炼钢运动以来，曾从轻工业系统中调动一部分职工参加炼钢炼铁，交通运输方面也延缓了一些轻工业原料的运输。为钢铁让路这是正确的。但是由于一部分人忽视了既要让路，又要跃进的精神，有些轻工业品的产量下降。这种片面的认识在传达中央召开的工业书记会议精神后彻底澄清了，“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的思想大大发扬。
    甘肃各级党组织纷纷加强领导生活资料的生产。各专区在提前完成全年钢铁生产任务后，在不影响明年的钢铁生产任务的条件下，从钢铁战线抽调了几万劳动力，加强了制糖、造纸、食品加工等的生产，并挤出部分设备制造力量，抽空为新建轻工业工厂赶制出数百套小型设备。中共甘肃省委、兰州市委组织的检查团，对完不成生产计划的工厂进行了督促检查。兰州卷烟厂去年8月到10月完不成计划，经检查团帮助解决困难后，11月上旬就超额完成计划，产量比10月份同期约增一半。中共兰州市委并设法调剂出电动机，让文化造纸厂新安装的造纸机能够及早生产。
    全省在加紧轻工业品的生产中，碰到了设备能力不足和原料供应上的困难。由于各地党委坚决走依靠群众的道路，困难正一个个解决，生产在日日高涨。因为动员了甜菜产地各人民公社的力量，在大型机制糖厂未建成前，就办起了二百多个土法制糖厂。这工厂用铡刀切丝，用铁锅熬糖，设备虽简，日产总能力却高达百吨上下，能生产白糖，还能制红糖。牧区的人民公社也建起一批干品加工厂，用土法制造干粉。在新建的一批机制纸厂未投入生产前，各地党委就发动职工用木材自制简易造纸机，先用土法土马开始生产。兰州的热水瓶厂在缺少重要原料纯碱的情况下，发起了群众性的“抗旱”运动。一方面至各地收集土碱代替纯碱做原料，另外又收集破玻璃，利用破玻璃所含的碱分作原料，不但维持了生产，产量还比以前上升。兰州肥皂厂千方百计利用肠衣厂、屠宰场、骨肥厂、榨油厂剩下的下脚油作原料，克服了缺少硬化脂的困难，近十几天来产量比上月同期增加了30％多。
