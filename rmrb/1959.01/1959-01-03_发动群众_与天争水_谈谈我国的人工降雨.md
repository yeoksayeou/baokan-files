Mobilize the Masses to Fight the Heavens for Water
A Discussion of Artificial Rain in China
By Cheng Chunshu, Deputy Director of the Observatory, Central Meteorological Bureau

Before discussing artificial rain, we must first understand how natural rain (or snow) is formed. Rain requires clouds. As long as there is sufficient moisture in the air, and rising air currents cause the moist air to cool as it rises, the water vapor will condense into countless tiny water droplets (cloud droplets), forming clouds. However, the condensation of water vapor requires fine dust or salt particles as nuclei, and these impurities are generally not lacking in the air.

Cloud droplets are very small and numerous. In clouds that are not raining, their diameter is about one-hundredth of a millimeter. Such small cloud droplets are difficult to fall out of the cloud; even if they do, they fall very slowly and evaporate before reaching the ground, so they do not count as rain. Cloud droplets must have conditions to continue to grow in order to become rain. The diameter of drizzle is greater than one-tenth of a millimeter, and the diameter of the largest raindrops can be as large as five millimeters.

There are two processes by which tiny cloud droplets become raindrops. One is merging. The impurities in the cloud that serve as condensation nuclei vary in size, and the temperature in different parts of the cloud varies, so cloud droplets form at different times. Therefore, cloud droplets in the same cloud are also of different sizes. Larger cloud droplets fall faster and are more likely to encounter more small cloud droplets along the way, merging and growing larger. Water droplets large enough fall all the way to the ground without evaporating completely, and that is rain.

The other process of cloud droplet growth is the so-called ice crystal process. Observations have shown that a large part of the clouds are often at temperatures much lower than 0 degrees Celsius, but the cloud droplets are still water droplets and do not freeze into ice. Even at temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius, some of these "supercooled" (overcooled) water droplets still exist. The part of the cloud with a temperature between 0 and -20 degrees is often supercooled water droplets mixed with ice crystals. The simultaneous existence of these two is of great significance. Due to the different properties of ice crystals and water droplets, the air is already saturated if the same amount of water vapor is on ice; however, if it is on the surface of water, it has not reached saturation. Therefore, in the same cloud, ice crystals grow faster than water droplets and take water vapor from the water droplets to feed themselves. Ice crystals grow into snowflakes, many snowflakes combine into snow fragments, and the relatively heavy snow fragments melt into water when they fall through air above zero degrees, which is rain. This is one of the most important processes in the formation of natural rain.

Many clouds are neither very high nor very thin, but they do not rain. This is mainly because the growth of cloud droplets is limited by weather conditions and they never turn into raindrops. The method of artificial rain is to promote clouds with suitable conditions to quickly enlarge cloud droplets and rain. According to our current understanding of the natural rain formation process, the way to make artificial rain is to try to increase the number of ice crystals in supercooled clouds as the basis for the growth of cloud droplets. Or, introduce a large number of large water droplets and condensation nuclei.

Using an airplane to spread dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) particles on supercooled clouds, the temperature of the surrounding air can quickly drop to -40 degrees Celsius as the dry ice falls, causing billions of tiny ice crystals to form in the air. With so many ice crystals, the cloud droplets in the supercooled cloud will have the conditions to quickly increase in size, promoting rain formation.

Another method is to burn certain chemical agents (silver iodide is now considered the best) into smoke at high temperatures and let the wind carry them into the clouds. Because its crystal structure is similar to that of ice crystals, it can also promote the enlargement of cloud droplets. It can only be used in colder clouds. These chemical agents can also be carried into the air near the clouds by balloons to burn, or carried by airplanes to burn and spread. Mountainous areas have many local rising air currents, which are especially conducive to this type of operation.

A third method of promoting cloud droplet merging is to use an airplane to spray fine water droplets in appropriate parts of the cloud (according to existing experience, a diameter of about one-twentieth of a millimeter is better); finely ground salt particles can also be sprayed to provide the cloud with a batch of condensation nuclei, creating large cloud droplets. Salt powder can also be sent into the clouds with artillery shells or sprayed on hilltops.

Clouds are alive, changing, and have their various stages of development. For example, we seed the clouds to promote the growth of cloud droplets, but the air current conditions are promoting the demise of the cloud. A relatively full grasp of the air movement conditions and changes around the cloud, and a grasp of the physical properties of the cloud, are important for deciding how to carry out specific operations. The specific changes in the cloud are very complex. At present, before the experiment, we often cannot fully grasp these conditions, which more or less limits the certainty of artificial rain. We cannot make it rain every time, or make it rain as much as we want.

China has a vast territory, and some areas always experience droughts of varying sizes every year. We need to use various methods to fight the heavens for water. Jilin's experience in using artificial rain to alleviate drought last year tells us that artificial rain experiments are worth continuing. This is an important measure for us to fight drought in the future. However, not many experiments have been done in this area in China so far, and the technology is not very mature, especially for how to make rain under various climatic conditions in various regions. Therefore, a larger-scale rainmaking requires careful experimentation. Therefore, artificial rainmaking cannot yet be regarded as the most important measure to solve the drought problem, and the many existing drought prevention facilities should not be relaxed as a result.

China has a variety of climates and terrains, and each region has its own weather characteristics. There are also various different characteristics and problems in artificial precipitation experiments, which are by no means completely solved by the existing methods. Various places should combine their needs to experiment more, think of more methods, mobilize the masses to experiment, and engage in indigenous methods on a large scale in order to develop artificial rainmaking everywhere and solve practical problems.

Regarding artificial rain, there are two things to do at present. The first is to find some areas, invest more resources, and expand the area of each experiment. China's drought is generally not a problem of individual counties, but a drought that affects one or two provinces. In order to be able to meet the needs of such a large area in a timely manner in the future, a larger area must be used as the target of the experiment to study operating technology and gain experience.

The second is to rapidly develop the technology of experimenting with artificial rain on the ground, and mobilize the masses to engage in it. China's vast mountainous areas have many favorable local weather conditions. When the masses engage in it, they will have many methods to draw water from large and small clouds in the mountains, increase a water source for water conservancy, and bring new content to meteorological science.

At present, in addition to the Soviet Union investing huge resources in the experimental research on artificial weather control, only a few capitalist countries have experiments abroad, and the scale of the experiments is not large. They do not have the urgent impetus to solve practical needs for the people, and most of the experiments are confined to so-called scientific problems, and progress is very slow. The United States already has some "commercial rainmakers." At first glance, it seems that their rainmaking has reached a stage where it can solve practical problems, but in fact, the experiment is still paid for by those who need it. Since the experiment of artificial rain in the United States, due to the many conflicts of interest between capitalists, many legal problems have emerged. Orchard capitalists once sued agricultural capitalists. In the United States, if there is a flood somewhere, the affected area will demand huge compensation from unrelated artificial rainmakers, and some people even simply demand a ban on artificial rain. These are all insurmountable contradictions in capitalist society.

    发动群众　与天争水
    谈谈我国的人工降雨
    中央气象局观象台副台长　程纯枢
    在谈人工降雨之前，首先要了解自然的雨（或雪）是怎样形成的。下雨先要有云。空气中只要有相当的水分，有上升的气流使湿空气在上升过程中变冷，水气就会凝结成无数细小的水滴（云滴），构成云块。但水气凝结的时候需要有细微的尘埃或盐类等杂质做核心，这些杂质空气中一般并不缺乏。
    云滴体积很小，数量很多，在不下雨的云里，它的直径约百分之一毫米左右。这样小的云滴很难掉出云外；即便掉出来，落得很慢，到不了地面，便蒸发掉了，不算雨。云滴必须有继续变大的条件，才能成雨。毛毛雨的直径大于十分之一毫米，最大的雨点直径大到五毫米。
    细小的云滴变成雨点的过程有两种。一种是合并。云里作为凝结心的杂质大小不一，云各部分的温度有差别，云滴生成有迟早。因此同一块云里面云滴也大小不一样。较大的云滴落得快些，途中容易碰着较多的小云滴，并吞而增大。足够大的水滴一直落到地面还没有蒸发完，便是雨。
    云滴增长的另一种过程是所谓冰晶过程。人们根据观测结果知道，云块里往往有很大一部分温度比摄氏零度还低得多，但是，云滴还是水滴，不结成冰。甚至温度低到零下四十度时，还有一些这种“过冷却的”（冷却过度的）水滴存在。云温度在零度到负二十度之间的部分，往往是过冷却水滴而掺有冰晶。这两者的同时存在具有很重要的意义。由于冰晶与水滴性质不同，同样多的水气，如果是在冰上的话，空气已经饱和；但是，如果在水面上的话，就没有达到饱和。所以，在同一块云里，冰晶比水滴增长得快，而且从水滴夺取水气以自肥。冰晶长大成雪花，许多雪花并成雪片，比较重的雪片在下落时经过零度以上的空气，溶化成水，就是雨。这是自然雨的一种最重要的形成过程。
    有好多云不很高也不很薄，但是不下雨，这主要是因为云滴的增长受到了天气条件的限制，始终变不成雨滴。人工降雨的办法，就是促进有相当条件的云，使云滴迅速增大下雨。根据我们现在对自然雨生成过程的了解，人工降雨的途径是设法使过冷却的云里增加很多冰晶，作为云滴增长的基础。或者是引入大批的大水滴和凝结核。
    用飞机在过冷却的云上播撒干冰（固体二氧化碳）粒块，干冰下降时，附近的空气温度可以迅速降到零下四十度，使空中的水气结出亿万个微小的冰晶。有了这许多冰晶，过冷却云的云滴便有条件迅速增大，促进雨的形成。
    另一种方法是把某些化学用剂（现在认为最好的一种是碘化银）用高温燃成烟，让风带到云里去。因为它的结晶结构与冰晶相似，也能促进云滴增大。它也只能用在较冷的云里。这些化学用剂也可以用气球带到近云的空中去燃烧，或者用飞机带着燃烧散布。山地多局部上升气流，尤其有利于这种作业。
    第三种促进云滴合并的方法，是用飞机在云的适当部位喷射细水滴（按现有经验，其直径在二十分之一毫米左右好些）；也可喷撒碾细了的盐粒，使云得到一批凝结核，以造成大粒的云滴。盐粉也可以用炮弹往云里送，或在山头上喷射。
    云是活的、变的，有它的各种发展阶段。例如，我们播云促进云滴的增长，而气流的条件却正在促使云消亡。比较充分地掌握云四周空气运动的情况和变化，掌握云的物理性质，对于决定如何进行具体作业，是重要的。云的具体变化过程很复杂，目前我们在试验之前，往往还不能把这条件完全都掌握好，或多或少地限制了人工降雨的把握性，暂时还不能做一回下一回，希望下多少雨就下多少雨。
    我国幅员广大，每年总有一些地区发生大小不同的旱情。我们需要用各种方法与天争水。吉林去年用人工降雨的办法减轻旱灾的经验告诉我们，人工降雨试验值得继续做，这是我们今后与旱灾作斗争的一个重要措施。但是，现在我国在这方面所做过的试验不很多，技术上还不很成熟，特别是对各地区各色各样的气候条件下如何造雨，还没有充分的经验。因此，更大规模地造雨，还需要进行周密的试验。所以，目前还不能够把人工造雨看成是解决干旱问题的最主要措施，不能因此而放松已有的许多防旱设施。
    我国气候、地形多种多样，各地区各有它的天气特点，在人工降水试验上也有各种不同的特点和问题，决不是现有一些办法所能完全解决的，各地结合需要多试验，多想办法，发动群众来试验，大搞土办法，才能处处发展人工造雨，解决实际问题。
    关于人工降雨，目前有两件事要做。第一是找一些地区，投入更大的力量，扩大每次试验的面积。我国的旱情一般都不是个别县的问题，一旱就是一两个省，为了今后能够及时满足这样大地区的需要，必须以较大的面积作为试验的目标，研究作业技术，取得经验。
    第二是迅速发展在地面上试验人工降雨的技术，并且发动群众来搞。我国广大的山区有很多有利的局部天气条件，群众搞起来，会有很多方法，从山区大大小小的云块里取下水来，为水利化增加一个水源，并给气象科学带来全新的内容。
    目前，除了苏联在人工控制天气的试验研究上投入巨大力量以外，国外只有几个资本主义国家有试验，而且试验规模不大。他们没有迫切的为人民解决实际需要的推动力，试验大多拘泥于所谓科学问题，进展很慢。美国已有一些“商业造雨者”，初看起来好像他们的造雨已经达到很解决实际问题的阶段，其实，还是由需要者出钱做试验。美国试验人工降雨以来，由于资本家之间利害冲突多，已经出现了许多法律问题。果园资本家曾与农业资本家对讼。在美国，如果有一处出现洪水，受害的地方就会有人要求不相干的人工降雨者赔偿巨款，甚至还有人干脆要求禁止人工降雨。这都是资本主义社会不可克服的矛盾。
