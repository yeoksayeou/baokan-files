Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 2nd: The West European six-nation "Common Market" composed of France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg came into effect on January 1st. According to the agreement, the six countries will gradually reduce tariffs between them, starting with a 10% reduction this year. These countries also began implementing another measure yesterday, which is to increase their imports from each other by 20%.

British government officials, when talking about the entry into force of the "Common Market" yesterday, reiterated that Britain's attitude towards the "Common Market" remains unchanged. These officials said that at the meeting of the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" scheduled for January 15th, Britain will still insist that the six "Common Market" countries extend the measure of increasing their import volume from each other to the other six industrialized countries in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, and on this basis, extend the provision of raising the import limit of each item to at least 3% of the national output of that item to the other eleven countries outside the six countries in the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation".

Because Britain fears that the establishment of the "Common Market" will damage its position in the Western European mainland market, it has always opposed the six-nation West European "Common Market" and has proposed the establishment of a "free trade zone" plan to counter the "Common Market." At the "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" meeting held in mid-December last year, the contradictions between the two national groups in the organization on trade issues were discussed, but the two sides argued without result and dispersed. With the entry into force of the "Common Market," the financial and trade melee that has recently unfolded in Western Europe will become even more intense.

    西欧“共同市场”开张
    英国政府人士重申态度不变
    新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：由法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡组成的西欧六国“共同市场”在1月1日生效。根据协议，六国将逐步降低它们之间的关税，今年先降低10％。这些国家在昨天还开始实行另一项措施，就是要把它们彼此间的进口增加20％。
    英国政府人士昨天在谈到“共同市场”生效时，重申英国对“共同市场”的态度不变。这些人士说，在订于1月15日举行的“欧洲经济合作局”会议上，英国将仍然坚持要求“共同市场”六国把它们增加彼此间进口额的措施，扩大适用于欧洲经济合作局中另外六个工业发达国家，并且在这一基础上，把每一项货品的进口限额提高到至少是那一项目全国产量的3％的规定，扩大适用于“欧洲经济合作局”中六国以外的其他十一个国家。
    英国由于害怕“共同市场”的成立损害它在西欧大陆市场上的地位，一直表示反对西欧六国“共同市场”，并且提出建立“自由贸易区”的计划来与“共同市场”相抗衡。在去年12月中旬举行的“欧洲经济合作局”会议上，曾经讨论过这个组织中两个国家集团间在贸易问题上的矛盾，但是双方争持不下，无结果而散。随着“共同市场”的生效，最近在西欧展开的金融和贸易大混战将会更趋剧烈。
