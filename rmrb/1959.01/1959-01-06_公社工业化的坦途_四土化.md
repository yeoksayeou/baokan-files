The Smooth Road to Commune Industrialization – "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods"
Li Xiantang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Jin Southeast District Committee

Under the leadership of the CPC Jin Southeast District Committee, the people of the entire district have launched the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" (indigenous machine tool manufacturing, indigenous railway construction, indigenous motor manufacturing, indigenous mechanization) movement, and have achieved initial results. Practice has proven that the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement is a mass technical revolution movement, and an important method to gradually realize commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and from low to high.

Needs to Promote Production

Needs to promote production. The "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement in Jin Southeast District developed under these circumstances. With the overall Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, in the first half of 1958, every township and commune established its own industry; during the mass iron and steel smelting movement, many iron and steel plants were also established. These industries played a huge role in improving the technical equipment of agriculture, liberating labor, and improving productivity. However, at this time, the technical equipment needed in agriculture also put forward higher requirements like "the tide rises with the boat." As a result, the original production capacity and technical equipment of township and commune industries were greatly lagging behind, requiring new technical equipment. Therefore, improving technical equipment, liberating labor, and improving productivity became the most urgent mass demand on all fronts, including industry, agriculture, and transportation.

How can we obtain this technical equipment? In the beginning, many people wanted to reach out to the state and large industries. However, the state could not fully meet such a huge need. Later, under the education of the Party organization, the masses started to do it themselves. The masses fought a great battle for iron and steel production, and achieved a great harvest of iron and steel; they created various indigenous equipment, and achieved great achievements and rich experience in reforming tools. According to statistics from the Statistics Bureau, more than 800,000 new machines were created in the district. The flowers of the mass technical revolution are truly colorful and radiant. Seeing this situation, the District Committee, based on the inevitability that a large-scale mechanization and technical revolution would appear after the great iron and steel harvest, and the demands of the masses, loudly put forward the slogan of "indigenous machine tool manufacturing, indigenous railway construction, indigenous motor manufacturing, and indigenous mechanization," and made a decision to launch the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement throughout the district.

The widespread development of the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement gave the District Committee a good inspiration. That is, the overall Great Leap Forward has increased people's needs and brought difficulties, but the Great Leap Forward has also brought methods and created conditions to meet these needs and overcome these difficulties.

Two Steps Combined into One

The goal has been set, but how can we achieve this goal? Is it walking on one leg or two legs? There was a debate at the beginning. Some people who only saw the colorful mass movement said that foreign methods were unreliable, and simply started with indigenous methods to create the world; some people who only saw that foreign equipment was precise and efficient said that engaging in indigenous methods was not the right direction, and that foreign or semi-foreign methods were better. Both of these views are one-sided. Therefore, the District Committee rejected these two opinions and formulated a two-pronged approach. One is the "foreign leg" of large-scale foreign equipment, which is state-owned and county-run factories. The District Committee requires state-owned machinery factories to equip county-run factories with foreign machines, and county-run factories to arm communes and commune industries with semi-foreign machines and indigenous machines, which is called "hens laying eggs"; the other is the "indigenous leg" of the "three craftsmen." The "three craftsmen" are blacksmiths, carpenters, and coppersmiths. Organizing these "three craftsmen" can both imitate semi-foreign machines and create new machines and tools, which is called "laying eggs even without a hen." Combining indigenous production and foreign production forms a genuine mass movement with leadership and backbone, which can create high speed. Qin County did this and the effect was very good. In terms of the foundation of the machinery industry, this county is not as good as other counties, but because the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" formed a mass movement in the county and brought the role of the "three craftsmen" into play, the sound of machines resounded all over the county within a month. On the contrary, some counties with better foundations have fallen behind Qin County, because they have not truly valued the role of the "three craftsmen" and have not learned to walk on two legs.

Another benefit of walking on two legs is that it can train the masses and improve their skills during the production process. Because when there are no machines, you need to produce, and once produced, mastering the operating technology becomes the main problem. The District Committee saw this inevitability, and while producing machines, it paid attention to the cultivation of operating technical forces, turning the process of producing machines into a process of cultivating and training technical talents. Taking these two steps in one, the machines produced in the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" can be quickly used in production.

"One Indigenous" Drives "Three Indigenous"

After the team is organized, it is time to fight. How can this battle be fought well? Is it to divide the troops and guard the passes, grasping both sesame seeds and watermelons, or to focus on a key area and attack one wing, like picking grapes, grabbing the handle and lifting them all up at once?

When considering this issue, the District Committee believed that two grape handles must be grasped, one is the "grain" of the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods", and the other is the issue of "digestion".

The foundation of the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" is the great harvest of iron and steel, and iron and steel is the "grain" of the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement. However, both ensuring the completion of the national iron and steel plan and engaging in the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" seems to make iron and steel insufficient. Therefore, in order to launch the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement vigorously and persist in it, we must use the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" to promote a greater harvest of iron and steel, so as to prepare sufficient "grain" for the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods". From this point of view, the District Committee determined the principle of giving priority to equipping mines and manufacturing metallurgical equipment, and quickly armed the iron and steel army with machinery. In mining, the use of twist drills for drilling holes was realized, crushers were used for crushing ore, material hoppers and water column anemometers were installed on indigenous blast furnaces, and more than 5,000 sets of mining and metallurgical machinery were produced, gradually turning indigenous blast furnaces into foreign blast furnaces, greatly improving the quantity and quality of iron produced, and satisfying the "grain" supply of the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement while completing the national iron transfer task.

Having iron and steel requires machines, which is the issue of "digestion." Of course, the entire "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" movement is a movement to digest iron and steel, but digesting iron and steel must be done through machine tools, through the machinery manufacturing industry. That is to say, machine tool manufacturing is the red line driving the "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods". Grasping the handle of machine tool manufacturing can lift a string of grapes of "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods". Therefore, after producing the necessary metallurgical equipment, we concentrated our efforts to make a breakthrough in indigenous machine tool manufacturing. In the machinery industry, the method of "hens laying eggs and eggs hatching chicks" was implemented, that is, the machinery industry produces indigenous machine tools or semi-foreign machine tools, and the communes use these indigenous machine tools to reproduce indigenous lathes; the "three craftsmen" are required to "lay eggs even without hens, and hatch chicks after laying eggs." In this way, by rolling and increasing the number, the district quickly produced 1,624 indigenous and semi-foreign lathes, with an average of more than ten in each commune.

At the beginning of implementing the policy of "One Indigenous" driving "Three Indigenous", some people still had ideological problems, saying that "grasping one transformation, losing three indigenous". But before long, the facts refuted this fallacy. A large number of facts prove that focusing on indigenous machine tool manufacturing not only does not lose "Three Indigenous", but greatly drives "Three Indigenous". Thousands of machine tools in the district rotate at the same time to digest iron and steel, and can produce many indigenous machines in one day. According to incomplete statistics, in just over ten days, the district produced more than 330,000 various indigenous machines. The construction of reservoirs in the district has been fully semi-mechanized, and work efficiency has increased by one and a half times. In grinding flour and rice, dining hall tools, and transportation, mechanization and semi-mechanization have also begun to varying degrees, greatly liberating labor and improving work efficiency. It can be seen that it is a faster, better, and more economical road to arm industry with "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" first, and then equip agriculture with industry to improve rural technical equipment.

A Smooth Road to Commune Industrialization

"Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" is not only an expedient measure to overcome the labor shortage, but also has very far-reaching significance. Because everything develops from low to high, and foreign things can emerge from indigenous things. Further development of indigenous machine tool manufacturing can gradually realize commune industrialization; further development of indigenous mechanization, once the "indigenous" is removed, is rural mechanization; further development and popularization of indigenous motor manufacturing is rural electrification; further development of indigenous railway construction, and connecting with modern railways, is the modernization of rural transportation. Is this interpretation correct? I think it is correct. Shanxi Daily said it well when publishing the Jin Southeast District Committee's "Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods" plan:

"Four Transformations to Indigenous Methods are powerful, creating the world through self-reliance.
Transformation greatly liberates labor, transformation modernizes the countryside." (Attached picture)

    公社工业化的坦途——“四土化”
    中共晋东南地委书记处书记  李先唐
    中共晋东南地委领导全区人民开展了“四土化”（土机床化、土铁路化、土电机化、土机械化）运动，已经取得初步成绩。实践证明，“四土化”运动是群众性的技术革命运动，是逐步由土到洋、由小到大、由低到高地实现公社工业化、农业机械化、电气化的重要方法。
    需要促进生产
    需要促进生产。晋东南区的“四土化”运动就是在这样的情况下发展起来的。随着工农业生产的全面大跃进，1958年前半年，乡乡社社都办起了自己的工业；在全民炼钢铁运动中，又办起了许多钢铁厂。这些工业对改善农业的技术装备，对解放劳动力，提高生产力，发挥了极大的作用。但是，这时候，农业上需要的技术装备也“水涨船高”地提出了更高的要求。这样一来，原有乡社工业的生产能力和技术装备，就显得大大落后，要求新的技术设备。因此，改善技术装备，解放劳动力，提高生产力，就成为工业、农业和交通运输业等各个战线上最紧迫的群众要求了。
    怎样才能得到这些技术装备呢？开头许多人都想伸手向国家要，向大工业要。但是，国家不能完全满足这样庞大的需要。后来，在党组织的教育下，群众就自己动手搞起来。群众大战了钢铁生产，取得了钢铁的丰收；他们创造了各种土设备，在改革工具方面取得了伟大的成绩和丰富的经验。据统计局的统计，全区新创造的机具就有八十几万件。群众技术革命的花朵，真是万紫千红，光彩四射。地委看到这种情况，根据在钢铁大丰收之后，就要出现大搞机械化、大闹技术革命的必然性，和群众的要求，响亮地提出了“土机床化、土铁路化、土电机化和土机械化”的口号，作出了在全区开展“四土化”运动的决定。
    “四土化”运动的普遍开展，给了地委很好的启示。这就是全面大跃进提高了人们的需要，带来了困难，但是，大跃进也为满足这种需要，为克服这种困难带来了办法，创造了条件。
    两步并一步
    目标是订下来了，但是，怎样去实现这个目标呢？是一条腿走路，还是两条腿走路？开初曾发生过争论。光看到万紫千红的群众运动的人，说是洋的靠不上，干脆土法上马创天下；一些光看到洋装备精密效率高的人，就说搞土的不是方向，还是洋的或半洋的好。这两种人的看法都带有片面性。因此，地委拒绝了这两种意见，订出了两条腿走路的方针。一条是大洋群的“洋腿”，这就是国营和县营工厂。地委要求国营机械厂用洋机器装备县营工厂，县营工厂用半洋机械和土机械武装公社和公社工业，这叫“母鸡下蛋”；再一条就是“三匠”的“土腿”。“三匠”就是铁匠、木匠和铜匠。把这“三匠”组织起来，一则可以仿制半洋机械，一则可以创造新机械和机具，这叫做“没鸡也下蛋”。把土法生产和洋法生产结合起来，就形成了一个有领导有骨干的真正的群众运动了，就能创造高速度。沁县这样做了，效果很好。从机械工业的基础来说，这个县并不如其它县，但由于“四土化”在全县形成了群众运动，发挥了“三匠”的作用，在一个月之内，就全县遍地响起了机器的声音。相反，有些基础较好的县，却落在沁县的后头，原因就是他们没有真正重视“三匠”的作用，没有学会两条腿走路。
    两条腿走路的另一个好处是，可以在生产过程中锻炼群众，提高群众的技术。因为在没有机具的时候，需要去生产，一旦生产出来之后，掌握操作技术就成为主要的问题了。地委看到了这个必然性，在生产机具的同时，就注意了操作技术力量的培养，把生产机具的过程变成也是培养和训练技术人才的过程。这样两步并作一步走，就能把“四土化”中生产出来的机具，很快用到生产中去。
   “一土”带“三土”
    队伍组织好，就轮到放枪打仗了。这一仗如何才能打好呢？是分兵把口，芝麻西瓜一把抓，还是重点作战攻其一翼，像提葡萄那样，抓住把子一下全提起来呢？
    地委在考虑这个问题时，认为两个葡萄把必须抓住，一个是“四土化”的“粮食”，一个是“消化”问题。
    “四土化”的基础是钢铁的大丰收，钢铁是“四土化”运动的“粮食”。可是，既要保证国家钢铁计划的完成，又要大搞“四土化”，就显得钢铁不够用了。因此，为了把“四土化”运动开展得热火朝天并坚持下去，就必须用“四土化”来促进钢铁的更大丰收，以便给“四土化”准备充足的“粮食”。从这样的观点出发，地委确定了优先装备矿山和制造冶金设备的原则，很快用机械武装了钢铁大军。在采矿方面实现了打眼用麻花钻，碎矿用上了粉碎机，土高炉上安了料钵料斗、鱼口和水柱测风器，还生产出矿山和冶金机械五千多部，把土高炉逐渐变成洋高炉，大大提高了产铁的数量、质量，在完成国家调铁任务的同时，满足了“四土化”运动的“粮食”供应。
    有了钢铁还得有机器，这就是“消化”问题。当然，整个“四土化”运动，就是一个消化钢铁的运动，但消化钢铁，却必须通过机床，通过机械制造工业。这就是说，机床化是带动“四土化”的红线，抓住机床化这个把子，就能提起“四土化”的成串葡萄。因此，我们在生产了必要的冶金设备之后，就集中力量突击了土机床化。在机械工业中实行“母鸡下蛋，蛋又孵小鸡”的办法，这就是机械工业生产出土机床或半洋机床，公社就用这些土机床再生产土车床；对“三匠”则要求他们“没鸡也下蛋，下蛋就孵小鸡”。这样打滚加番，全区很快就生产出了一千六百二十四台土的和半洋的车床，平均每个公社就有十多台。
    在一开始实行“一土带三土”的方针时，还有人思想不通，说什么“抓了一化，丢了三土”。但是没有多久，事实就驳倒了这种错误论调。大量的事实证明，着重抓土机床化，不但不是丢了“三土”，而是大大地带动了“三土”。全区一千几百台机床同时转动消化钢铁，一天中就能生产很多很多的土机械。据不完全的统计，十几天中，全区就生产出了各种土机械三十三万多件。全区的水库建设全面作到了半机械化，工作效率提高了一倍半。在磨面碾米、食堂工具和交通运输方面，也程度不同地开始了机械化和半机械化，大大解放了劳动力，提高了工作效率。这就可以看出，先用“四土化”武装工业，然后再由工业去装备农业，改善农村的技术设备，是一条多快好省的道路。
    通向公社工业化的坦途
    “四土化”不仅是渡过劳力紧张关的权宜之计，而是有非常深远的意义。因为任何事物都是由低到高发展的，土中可以出洋。土机床化再向前发展，就可以逐步实现公社工业化；土机械化再向前发展，一去“土”，就是农村机械化；土电机化再向前发展普及，就是农村电气化；土铁路化再向前发展，和现代化的铁路联接起来，就是农村交通运输的现代化。这样解释对不对呢？我想是对的。山西日报在发表晋东南地委的“四土化”规划时说得好：
    “四土化神通大，自力更生创天下。
    化的劳力大解放，化的农村现代化。”（附图片）
