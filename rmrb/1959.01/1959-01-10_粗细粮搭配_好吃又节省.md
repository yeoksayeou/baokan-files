According to the Yunnan Daily, the Huancheng People's Commune in Qujing County, by calculating accounts carefully and raising the awareness of its members, has enabled all public canteens to implement planned grain consumption and establish vegetable bases to meet the members' vegetable needs.

In 1958, the Huancheng People's Commune had a bumper agricultural harvest. All twenty-eight public canteens in the commune, in order to ensure that members ate their fill and ate well, relaxed the grain consumption standards and only ate refined grains. The members were very dissatisfied with this approach and discussed it frequently. The commune's Party committee, based on the members' feedback, conducted education on planned grain consumption. After mass discussions, planned grain consumption was generally implemented.

To ensure this work was done well, the commune's Party committee held two on-site meetings in the advanced Huake canteen. The main advanced experiences of the Huake public canteen were: First, a good combination of coarse and refined grains (rice, corn, vegetables). Second, improved cooking techniques. Third, more vegetables, with a stir-fried dish and a soup regularly. Therefore, they not only ate their fill, ate economically, but also ate well. After the meeting, all canteens took action.

Due to the implementation of planned grain consumption, the public canteens of this commune not only saved a lot of grain, but also the members ate well, gave good feedback, and their production enthusiasm was also very high.

    粗细粮搭配
    好吃又节省
    据云南日报消息　曲靖县环城人民公社通过算细账，提高社员认识，各公共食堂普遍实行计划用粮，并建立蔬菜基地，满足社员吃菜的要求。
    1958年，环城人民公社农业大丰收。全社二十八个公共食堂为了让社员吃饱吃好，把用粮标准放宽了，而且全部吃细粮。社员们对这种做法很不满意，议论纷纷。公社党委根据社员们的反映，进行了关于计划用粮的教育，经过群众讨论，普遍实行计划用粮。
    为了把这个工作作好，公社党委在先进的花柯食堂连续开了两次现场会。花柯公共食堂的先进经验主要是：第一，粗细粮（米、包谷、菜）搭配好。第二，提高煮饭技术。第三，多吃蔬菜，经常有一个炒菜，一个汤。因此，他们不但吃的饱、吃的省，而且也吃的好。会后，各个食堂都行动起来。
    由于实行计划用粮，这个公社各公共食堂不但节省了很多粮食，而且社员们吃的好，反映也好，生产积极性也很高。
