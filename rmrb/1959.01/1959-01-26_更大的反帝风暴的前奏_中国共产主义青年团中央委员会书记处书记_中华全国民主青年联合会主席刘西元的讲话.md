Comrades and friends:
    Chinese youth are filled with excitement upon hearing the news of the Cuban people's revolutionary victory and the Congolese people's anti-colonialist struggle. After a hard struggle, the Cuban people overthrew the reactionary dictatorial rule supported by U.S. imperialism and won freedom. This is a great victory for the Cuban people. The Cuban people are currently fighting to eliminate counter-revolutionary remnants and to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. interference. We believe that with the support of the people of the world, the Cuban people will surely achieve final victory.
    In Africa, the Congo, which was once regarded by the West as a "stable oasis," has also erupted in an armed struggle against colonial rule. The Congolese people bravely stood up, took up arms to fire at colonialism, and are unyieldingly fighting for national independence. We believe that the awakened Congolese people will surely shatter the shackles of colonialism that are on them!
    The struggles of the Cuban and Congolese peoples have opened the prelude to the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America this year, foreshadowing a greater storm against imperialism and colonialism that is about to come. Now, America's "backyard" has become the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle. Cuba, the "sweetest country" in the world, is no longer giving the United States a "sweet taste" but a "bitter one." Africa, once called the "Dark Continent" by colonialists, has had the raging fire of anti-colonial rule drive away the "darkness" and illuminate the people of all of Africa. At present, this continent has truly become a continent of darkness for imperialism and colonialism. These facts clearly show that the days of imperialism are really not good, they are rotting away day by day, and the days of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are getting better day by day. As long as the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America unite and carry out a firm struggle, they will surely be able to defeat imperialism. In this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and stronger, fully supporting the national independence movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We can say with great certainty that in the worldwide struggle against imperialism and colonialism, all peace-loving people and oppressed people around the world will surely win. One hundred and twenty million young people in China, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely stand on the side of the Cuban and Congolese people and fully support their just struggle. In order to better support them, the youth of our country must work harder, accelerate the construction of our great socialist motherland, and give imperialism a heavy blow.
    People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, unite and overthrow the imperialist colonial system!
    Long live the victory of the national liberation movement!

    更大的反帝风暴的前奏
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记  中华全国民主青年联合会主席刘西元的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    中国青年听到了古巴人民革命胜利和刚果人民反殖民主义斗争的消息以后，都充满着激动和兴奋的心情。古巴人民经过艰苦的斗争以后，推翻了美帝国主义支持的反动独裁统治，获得了自由。这是古巴人民的伟大胜利。古巴人民目前正在为肃清反革命残余，为维护民族独立和反对美国干涉而进行斗争。我们相信，古巴人民在全世界人民的支持下，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    在非洲，一向被西方认为是“安定的绿洲”的刚果，也爆发了反殖民主义统治的武装斗争。刚果人民英勇地站起来，拿起武器向殖民主义开火，不屈不挠地为争取民族独立而进行着斗争。我们相信，觉醒了的刚果人民，一定能够把殖民主义套在他们身上的枷锁，彻底粉碎！
    古巴人民和刚果人民的斗争，揭开了今年亚、非、拉丁美洲人民反帝斗争的序幕，它预示着反对帝国主义和殖民主义的更大的风暴，将要来临。现在，美国的“后院”变成了反帝斗争的前线。古巴这个世界上“最甜的国家”，使美国尝到的不再是“甜头”而是“苦头”。一向被殖民主义者称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，反殖民统治的熊熊烈火，驱走了“黑暗”，照亮了全非洲的人民。目前，这块大陆对帝国主义和殖民主义者来说，倒真正变成了他们前途黑暗的大陆了。这些事实清楚地说明了：帝国主义的日子实在不好过，他们正在一天天地烂下去，亚、非、拉丁美洲人民的日子正在一天天地好起来。只要亚、非、拉丁美洲的人民团结起来，进行坚定的斗争，就一定能够打败帝国主义。在这东风压倒西风的时代，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大，全力支持亚、非、拉丁美洲人民的民族独立运动。我们可以十分肯定地说，在全世界反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，全世界爱好和平的人民和被压迫的人民一定胜利。全中国一亿二千万青年，和全国人民一起，坚决站在古巴人民和刚果人民的一边，全力支持他们的正义斗争。为了更好地支持他们，我国青年要更加鼓足干劲，加速建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国，给帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义殖民制度！
    民族解放运动胜利万岁！
