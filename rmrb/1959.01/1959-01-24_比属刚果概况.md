    Editor's Note: The Belgian Communist Party's "Red Flag" published an article on January 7th entitled "What do you know about the Congo...". In order to help readers understand the situation in the Belgian Congo, we are publishing an excerpt below.

    Area
    According to the statistics of December 31, 1957, the area of the Congo is 2,344,932 square kilometers. This is equal to seventy-six times the area of Belgium.

    Population
    The population of the Congo is 13,290,687, of which 13,182,006 are Black and 108,681 are White.

    National Income
    Approximately 50 billion Belgian francs per year. Only half of this belongs to the 13,182,000 Black residents. The other half goes to the 108,000 White people and their banks.

    Thus, the average annual income per Black person is only 2,000 Belgian francs.

    Serious Unemployment
    Statistics from the beginning of 1958 show that industrial and mining enterprises employed 1,147,712 Black workers.

    This figure is 50,000 fewer than in 1957. To these 50,000 unemployed, we must add tens of thousands of other unemployed.

    The "Evening News" of January 6th revealed that in Leopoldville alone, there are more than 50,000 unemployed. It is pointed out that in the industrial centers of Katanga Province, there are thousands of unemployed. These unemployed receive no relief. The bosses and administrative authorities are trying to drive them back into the jungle in order to reduce the urban population.

    In the past, however, they were often forcibly taken from their villages and transported hundreds of miles away to work for colonial enterprises.

    The Poverty of the Congo... and its Immense Resources
    The phenomenon of unemployment without any assistance, meager wages, and the poverty of the Congolese people is all the more egregious because it exists in a particularly rich country.

    The Congo now produces approximately 8,000 tons of peanut oil, 231,000 tons of coconut oil, 130,000 tons of cotton (it produced 160,000 tons in 1952), 43,000 tons of coffee, 35,000 tons of rubber, tens of thousands of tons of precious timber, etc. annually.

    The Congo also has abundant and uniquely diverse mineral resources. It produces approximately the following annually:

    11,500 kilograms of pure gold, 5,500 tons of cobalt, 360,000 tons of manganese, 240,000 tons of copper, 90 tons of silver, several million carats of industrial diamonds, more than 600,000 carats of pure gem-quality diamonds from the Kasai River, as well as lead, platinum, radium, and the famous uranium.

    The Highest Profits for Monopoly Organizations
    The total capital and reserves of the 500 Belgian companies operating in the Congo are 50.345 billion Belgian francs. In 1957, they themselves admitted that their profits reached 10.583 billion Belgian francs.

    This is equal to approximately 20% return on capital.

    By comparison, the 13,430 limited companies operating in Belgium have capital and reserves of 220 billion Belgian francs. Their total profits in 1957 were 2.101 billion, which is half the profit rate of those colonial companies.

### 比属刚果概况

    比属刚果概况
    编者按：比共“红旗报”1月7日发表“你对刚果知道一些什么……”一文。为了使读者了解比属刚果的情况，特摘要发表于后。
    面积
    根据1957年12月31日的统计，刚果的面积是两百三十四万四千九百三十二平方公里。这等于比利时面积的七十六倍。人　口
    刚果的人口有一千三百二十九万零六百八十七人，其中一千三百十八万二千零六名黑种人和十万零八千六百八十一名白种人。
    国民收入
    每年大约五百亿比利时法郎。其中只有一半属于一千三百十八万零两千黑种居民。另外的一半则到了十万零八千名白种人和他们的银行手中。
    这样，黑种人每人每年平均收入只有两千比利时法郎。
    严重的失业
    人们在1958年年初统计，工矿企业中雇用了一百一十四万七千七百一十二名黑种工人。
    这个数字比1957年度减少了五万人。在这五万失业者中，还要加上几万其他的失业者。
    1月6日的“晚报”揭露，单在利奥波德维尔，就有五万多失业者。人们指出，在加丹加省的各个工业中心，有着几千名失业者。这些失业者得不到任何救济金。老板和行政当局竭力地把他们赶到丛林中去，以便缩减城市人口。
    而过去，却经常是使用武力把他们从自己的乡村中押出来，押到几百里以外的地方为殖民企业劳动。
    刚果的贫困……而又有巨大的富源
    得不到丝毫援助的失业现象、吃不饱的工资，刚果居民的穷困、这种种现象由于是出现在一个特别富饶的国家里就更加显得丑恶。
    刚果现在每年要生产大约八千吨花生油、二十三万一千吨椰子油、十三万吨棉花（1952年时曾生产十六万吨）、四万三千吨咖啡、三万五千吨橡胶、几万吨名贵木材等等。
    刚果同样也有着丰富和各种特有的多样化的矿藏。它每年大约生产：
    一万一千五百公斤纯金、五千五百吨钴、三十六万吨锰、二十四万吨铜、九十吨银、几百万克拉工业用的金钢钻、六十万克拉以上的开赛河的纯金钢钻石、还有铅、白金、镭以及出名的铀。
    垄断组织的最高利润
    在刚果进行经营的五百家比利时公司的资金和预备金的总额是五百零三亿四千五百万比利时法郎。1957年，他们自己承认的利润达到一百零五亿八千三百万比利时法郎。
    这等于大约20％的资本利息。
    作为比较，在比利时经营的一万三千四百三十家股份有限公司拥有二千二百亿比利时法郎的资本和预备金。他们在1957年所得的利润共二十一亿零一千万，这比那些殖民公司的利润率还低一半。
