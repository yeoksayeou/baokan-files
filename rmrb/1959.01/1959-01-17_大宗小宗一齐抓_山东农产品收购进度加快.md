Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 16th: After various regions in Shandong Province strengthened leadership over the procurement of agricultural products, the progress of procurement for agricultural products such as grain and oil has accelerated compared to the previous period. As of January 8th, 81.8% of the grain requisition plan had been completed, and there was also progress in oil procurement. The daily procurement volume of the main oilseed, peanuts, has increased by more than double compared to the previous period.

In the past half month or so, relevant departments and regions in Shandong Province have taken measures to strengthen procurement work. After the Liuting Township Party Committee in Jimo County organized 2,275 cadres to participate in the procurement, the daily procurement volume of peanut kernels surged from 10,000 jin to more than 500,000 jin. Yantai Prefecture's various counties, as well as Wudi and Guangrao counties, entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives to collect on their behalf, and the procurement volume greatly increased.

During the procurement of grain and oil, all regions paid attention to the quality of work. They conducted a major cleanup, major inspection, and major settlement of the grain and oil that had already been purchased and put into storage, earnestly clarified the figures, completed the procedures, and established a storage system to avoid the occurrence of mold and spoilage of grain and oil.

In the procurement of agricultural products, Shandong regions have implemented the spirit of grasping both the major and the minor, while also purchasing small-scale agricultural and sideline products. They have adopted methods such as seizing time, finding gaps, combining supply with procurement, combining procurement with the development of diversified economy, and contracting procurement, so that the procurement volume of small-scale agricultural and sideline products and local specialties has also increased compared to the past.

    大宗小宗一齐抓
    山东农产品收购进度加快
    据新华社济南16日电　山东省各地加强对农产品收购工作的领导后，粮食油料等农产品的收购进度比前一时期加快了。到1月8日止，粮食征购计划已完成81.8％，油料收购也有进展，主要油料花生的日收购量已比前一时期增加一倍以上。
    近半个多月来，山东省各有关部门及各地区采取措施加强了收购工作。即墨县柳亭乡党委组织了二千二百七十五名干部参加收购以后，每天花生米的收购量由一万斤激增到五十多万斤。烟台专区各县和无棣、广饶等县，委托供销社代收，收购量大大增加。
    在粮油收购中，各地都注意了工作质量，对已经收购入库的粮食、油料，进行了大清理、大检查、大结算，切实弄清数字，办清手续，并建立保管制度，避免粮油霉烂现象发生。
    山东各地在农产品采购中，都贯彻了既抓大的、又抓小的的精神，同时收购小宗的农副产品。他们采取抓时间、找空隙、供应与收购相结合、收购与发展多种经济相结合，以及订合同收购等办法，使小宗农副产品和土特产品的收购量也较前有所增加。
