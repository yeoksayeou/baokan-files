(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, January 18th, dispatch) Reporter Zhu Bingju reports: Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, has adopted a "chain" method to systematically develop spare-time normal education and improve the level of the vast number of teachers, in order to meet the needs of the rapidly developing education cause.

Last year, Liyang County saw a substantial increase in the number of middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Adult spare-time education also expanded from the original 80,000+ people to 156,000+ people. In the great leap forward of cultural and educational undertakings, more than 4,300 people with primary school education levels took on the role of teachers in spare-time cultural and technical schools, and 2,000 rural women and older primary school students served as nursery workers and instructors. The original contingent of primary and secondary school teachers also saw a large increase of new teachers. These teachers are all in urgent need of continuous improvement in their teaching work.

The Liyang County Party Committee, based on the new situation, adopted a "chain" method to vigorously develop spare-time normal education. The county's 21 people's communes established 15 spare-time normal colleges, 132 spare-time normal schools (classes), and 21 spare-time preschool normal schools. All middle and primary school teachers participated in spare-time normal college advanced studies, all teachers of spare-time cultural and technical schools participated in spare-time normal school studies, and instructors and nursery workers all entered spare-time preschool normal schools to study.

The Party Committee Secretaries of the communes or production teams serve concurrently as the principals of the various levels of spare-time normal schools, and adopt a method of linking upwards and downwards, and chain tutoring to solve the problem of teaching staff. This is: the principals of middle schools in the communes concurrently serve as teachers in the spare-time normal colleges; students with higher levels in the spare-time normal colleges serve as teachers in the spare-time normal schools and spare-time preschool normal schools; students of spare-time preschool normal schools and spare-time normal schools serve as teachers in cultural and technical schools, and students of spare-time cultural and technical schools all serve as literacy teachers.

In addition, the county also established a full-time all-inclusive normal school (including normal colleges, secondary normal schools, and preschool normal schools), which, in addition to undertaking the task of training teachers, also provides certain guidance to the various levels of spare-time normal schools established by the communes in terms of professional skills.

The curriculum of these spare-time normal colleges and spare-time normal schools generally includes courses such as pedagogy, Chinese language, mathematics, and politics. Spare-time preschool normal schools also offer courses such as music, fine arts, dance, and hygiene knowledge. The school system is generally tentatively set for three to four years, with six hours of class per week. The school buildings all use the original central primary schools.

After this set of spare-time normal schools was established, it promptly helped teachers solve professional difficulties, improve their teaching level, and was warmly welcomed by the majority of teachers. For example, the students of the spare-time normal schools are all teachers of spare-time cultural and technical schools. The spare-time normal schools, based on their situation, first help them learn the textbooks of the spare-time cultural and technical schools well, help them solve teaching difficulties, playing a role in lesson preparation in teaching, and also improving their cultural level and teaching confidence, thus ensuring the teaching quality of the spare-time cultural and technical schools and consolidating spare-time education.

Although the set of spare-time normal schools established by Liyang County has not been established for long, the majority of teachers have already summarized several benefits: 1. All teachers can participate in learning and improve, thus ensuring the teaching quality of various types of schools, and schools can be further consolidated; 2. Combining current needs in teaching with gradual improvement, it can solve the problems encountered in teaching practice, achieve the integration of learning and application, and enable the integration of professional learning and cultural learning; 3. Using the form of spare-time normal schools to organize the majority of teachers to learn, chain tutoring, fixed teaching staff, spare-time normal schools themselves are easy to consolidate, learning time can be uniformly arranged, and it is also convenient to conduct business exchanges; 4. There is a unified management system and a unified teaching plan, which allows for the development of inspection and evaluation work.

    连环辅导教师多　统一安排进度快
    溧阳业余师范遍地开花
    本报南京18日电　记者朱冰菊报道：江苏溧阳县采取“连环套”的办法，系统地发展业余师范教育，提高广大师资水平，以适应教育事业飞跃发展的需要。
    溧阳县的中、小学和幼儿园，去年都有大量增加，成人业余教育也由原来的八万多人发展到十五万六千多人。在文教事业大跃进中，有四千三百多名小学文化水平的人担任了业余文化技术学校的教师，有二千名农村妇女和年龄较大的小学生担任了保育员和教养员，在原有的中小学教师队伍中也大量地增加了新教师。这些教师都迫切需要在教学工作中继续提高。
    中共溧阳县委根据新的情况，采取“连环套”的办法，大力发展业余师范教育。全县二十一个人民公社共办起了业余师范专科学校十五所，业余师范学校一百三十二所（班），业余幼儿师范二十一所。所有的中、小学教师都参加了业余师范专科学校进修，所有业余文化技术学校的教师都参加了业余师范学校学习，教养员和保育员都进了业余幼儿师范学习。
    各级业余师范学校，由公社或生产作业区的党委书记兼任校长，并采取上下挂钩、连环辅导的办法解决师资问题。这就是：公社内的中学校长兼任业余师专的教师；业余师专中水平较高的学生担任业余师范和业余幼儿师范的教师；业余幼儿师范和业余师范的学员，担任文化技术学校的教师，业余文化技术学校的学员都担任了扫盲教师。
    此外这个县还办了一所全日制的一揽子师范学校（包括师专、中师、幼师），除担任培养师资的任务外，对公社办起的各级业余师范在业务上也进行一定的辅导。
    这些业余师专和业余师范学校的课程，一般设有教育学、语文、数学、政治等课。业余幼师还设有音乐、美工、舞蹈、卫生常识等课。学制一般暂定为三年到四年，每周上课六小时，校舍都是利用原有的中心小学。
    这一套业余师范学校办起来后，及时地帮助教师解决了业务上的困难，提高了教学水平，受到了广大教师的热烈欢迎。如业余师范学校的学员，都是业余文化技术学校的教师。业余师范学校根据他们的情况，首先帮助他们学好业余文化技术学校的课本，帮助他们解决教学上的困难，在教学上起了备课作用，也提高了他们的文化水平和教学信心，这样也就保证了业余文化技术学校的教学质量，巩固了业余教育。
    溧阳县创办的这一套业余师范学校，时间虽然不久，广大教师已总结出几条好处：一、所有的教师都可以参加学习，得到提高，这样就保证了各类学校的教学质量，学校可以更加巩固；二、教学中目前需要和逐步提高相结合，既可以解决教学实践中碰到的问题，达到学以致用，又可以使业务学习和文化学习得到比较好的结合；三、用业余师范学校的形式把广大教师组织起来学习，连环辅导、师资固定，业余师范学校本身容易巩固，在学习时间上可以统一安排，也便于进行业务交流；四、有统一的管理制度，统一的教学计划，可以开展检查评比工作。
