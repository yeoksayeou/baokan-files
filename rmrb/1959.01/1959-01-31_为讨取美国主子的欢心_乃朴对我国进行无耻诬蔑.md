Xinhua News Agency, January 30th, Washington Dispatch: Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Secretary-General Nai Phoui Sananikhone delivered a speech in Washington on the 29th, launching a venomous smear campaign and attack against the Chinese people.

To achieve his sinister goal of inciting discord between the people of Asian countries and the Chinese people, this loyal lackey of American imperialism did not hesitate to fabricate the lie of China's so-called "subversive threat" to other regions of Asia, and slanderously accuse China of being a "very dangerous factor."

Nai Phoui lavished attacks on China at a luncheon of the "National Press Club" in the United States to curry favor with his masters.

While slandering and attacking the Chinese people, Nai Phoui also worked very hard to serve the colonialists, and tried his best to paralyze the will of the people of Asian countries to fight against colonial rule, saying that he personally believed that "the era of colonialism has definitely ended, so Asian countries have no reason to waste time and energy considering this matter." He also shamelessly tried to build connections for Japanese monopoly capital fostered by the United States, asking those Asian countries that had suffered terribly under Japanese imperialism during World War II not to dwell on Japan's old evils, "shouldn't always look back, but should look forward." He advocated that these Asian countries "cooperate" with Japan and accept the "help" of Japanese monopoly capital economically, just as European countries cooperate with West Germany. He also mentioned that developing "connections" between the Southeast Asia bloc, the North Atlantic bloc, and the "Baghdad Pact" bloc is "beneficial." He supports the Southeast Asian cultural and economic alliance secretly planned by the United States. He said, "This will not conflict with the objectives of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which aims to ensure the stability of the Southeast Asian region."

It was precisely to plan the "cooperation" between the above three imperialist aggressive military blocs that Nai Phoui arrived in Washington on the 23rd of this month to carry out activities. Prior to this, he had also "visited" the main member countries of these three aggressive military blocs.

### 为讨取美国主子的欢心  乃朴对我国进行无耻诬蔑

    为讨取美国主子的欢心
    乃朴对我国进行无耻诬蔑
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信29日在华盛顿发表谈话，对中国人民大肆进行恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。
    为了达到他挑拨亚洲各国人民同中国人民之间友好关系的罪恶目的，这个美帝国主义的忠实奴才不惜捏造所谓中国对亚洲其他地区的“颠覆威胁”的谰言，并且诬蔑中国是“非常危险的因素”。
    乃朴是在美国“全国新闻俱乐部”的午宴上对中国滥施攻击以讨取他的主子的欢心的。
    在诬蔑和攻击中国人民的同时，乃朴又十分卖力地为殖民主义者效劳，极力麻痹亚洲各国人民反对殖民统治的斗争意志，说什么他个人认为，“殖民主义的时代已经肯定地结束，因此亚洲国家没有理由浪费时间和精力来考虑这件事”。他还无耻地替美国扶植下的日本垄断资本拉拢关系，要那些曾经在第二次世界大战期间惨遭日本帝国主义蹂躏过的亚洲国家不要念念不忘日本的旧恶，“不应该总是往后看，而应该朝前看”。他鼓吹这些亚洲国家同日本“合作”，在经济上接受日本垄断资本的“帮助”，正如欧洲国家同西德合作一样。他还谈到，发展东南亚集团、北大西洋集团和“巴格达条约”集团之间的“联系”是“有益的”。他支持美国暗中策划的东南亚文化经济联盟。他说“这不会同东南亚条约组织的目的发生冲突，这个组织的目的是要保证东南亚地区的稳定”。
    正是为了策划上述三个帝国主义侵略性军事集团之间的“合作”问题，乃朴在本月23日到达华盛顿进行活动。在这以前，他还先后“访问”了这三个侵略性军事集团的主要成员国。
