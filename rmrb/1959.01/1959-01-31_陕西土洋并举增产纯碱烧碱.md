Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 30th: Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province are adopting a method of combining indigenous and foreign production methods, doing everything possible to increase the production of soda ash and caustic soda to meet the needs of the great leap forward in the steel, textile, light industry, chemical, and petroleum industries, and to improve the people's living standards.

Currently, relevant departments in Shaanxi Province have decided to add a small amount of equipment to the Shenmu Alkali Plant, so that its annual production of soda ash can be increased from more than 1,700 tons to about 8,000 tons, and it can also produce 4,000 tons of caustic soda. A large electrolytic plastics factory is under construction and will be put into production this year. It can produce 20,000 tons of soda ash and 15,000 tons of caustic soda annually. At the same time, the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, the state-owned Northwest First Printing and Dyeing Factory, and Pucheng and other counties are also building small alkali plants. The Hanzhong Special District is actively preparing to build small alkali plants using indigenous methods. The province plans to build more than 50 small alkali plants this year in areas with raw materials and factories that use a lot of alkali.

    陕西土洋并举增产纯碱烧碱
    新华社西安30日电　陕西省有关部门正在采取土法生产和洋法生产相结合的办法，千方百计地增产纯碱和烧碱，以适应钢铁、纺织、轻工、化学、石油等工业大跃进和人民生活水平提高的需要。
    目前，陕西省有关部门已经决定给神木碱厂增加少量设备，使它的纯碱年产量由一千七百多吨提高到八千吨左右，还可以生产烧碱四千吨。一个大型电解塑料厂正在建设，今年可以投入生产，它每年能产纯碱两万吨，烧碱一万五千吨。与此同时，新西北印染厂、国营西北第一印染厂和蒲城等县也在建设小型碱厂。汉中专区正在积极筹建用土法生产的小碱厂。全省计划今年在有原料的地区和用碱较多的工厂，建设五十多个小型碱厂。
