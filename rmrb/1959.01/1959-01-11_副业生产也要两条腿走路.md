Since the beginning of winter, sideline production in many places has been booming, with production scale, business scope, and development speed greatly exceeding those of previous years. This is mainly due to the unified arrangement and allocation of labor and funds by the people's communes, resulting in collective production. This shows that collective management of sideline occupations is the main way to rapidly increase commodity production, meet the needs of the state and urban and rural people, and increase commune income. Of course, the commune must do its utmost to improve the collectively managed sidelines. However, the rapid development of sideline production in various places is also due to the correct implementation of the Party's policy of developing sideline production also on two legs, that is, on the principle of collective production as the mainstay and individual production as a supplement, allowing and encouraging commune members to engage in some relatively dispersed, sporadic, and family-based small sidelines that the commune cannot currently organize for collective production.

Since these small family sidelines generally do not require much time or the addition of any equipment, nor do they require much production capital, commune members can use their leisure time and existing equipment and experience to engage in them without affecting collective labor, so they have developed rapidly. The fact that Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, developed pig farming is a good example. Wuqiao County originally had more than 75,000 pigs. After implementing the policy of collective production as the mainstay and individual production as a supplement, it increased to more than 126,000 in more than two months, and the speed of development greatly exceeded that of the past.

Under the premise of collective production, developing some small sideline occupations for commune member families is of great benefit to the country, the commune, and the commune members. First, it can promote the rapid development of sideline production and greatly increase social wealth. With the increase in total social product, it will be possible to better meet the needs of all parties. Secondly, individual production by commune members can make up for the shortcomings of collective production. In addition to what is consumed by commune member families, a portion can also be taken out for sale, to supply the market and meet social needs. Therefore, on the premise of not affecting collective production and collective labor, the commune should allow commune members to engage in some small family sidelines, raise some pigs and chickens, and grow some vegetables, etc., and provide them with the necessary assistance and care.

Will commune members developing some small family sidelines in addition to collective production lead to capitalism? Possibly, but it can be completely avoided. Because we now have more favorable conditions to prevent the emergence of capitalist tendencies. As long as the people's communes correctly implement the Party's policy on commune members' operation of small family sidelines, and, according to the nature of various sideline productions, unify planning and arrangements, determining which items are operated by the commune and which items are operated by commune member families, and include commune member family sidelines in the commune's plan, the emergence of capitalist tendencies can be effectively prevented. That is one point. Secondly, the small family sidelines operated by commune members are only to supplement the deficiencies of collective production, and the things produced are only small and sporadic, and can only partially meet the needs of the state and urban and rural people, and cannot play a decisive role in the commune's collective production and people's lives. Thirdly, the small freedom of individual commune members must first obey the large collective, individual production can only be carried out under the condition of not affecting collective labor, and commune members can only use their leisure time to engage in their own small family sidelines, and cannot occupy collective labor time. As long as the commune leadership makes full use of these favorable conditions, strengthens specific leadership over commune members' individual production, and continuously conducts ideological and political education for commune members, so that commune members consciously obey the plans of the state and the commune, the small family sidelines operated by commune members will not only fail to produce capitalism, but will also be able to serve the needs of the state and urban and rural people.

    副业生产也要两条腿走路
    曾志
    入冬以来，很多地方的副业生产搞得热热闹闹，生产规模、经营范围和发展的速度，都大大超过了往年。主要是由于人民公社统一安排和调配劳力、资金，进行集体生产的结果。由此可见，集体经营副业是迅速增加商品生产、满足国家和城乡人民需要和增加公社收入的主要途径。公社当然要尽最大努力把集体经营的副业搞好。但是，各地副业生产得到很快的发展，还由于正确贯彻了党的发展副业生产也要两条腿走路的方针，就是说，在集体生产为主、个人生产为辅的原则下，允许和鼓励社员经营了一些比较分散的、零星的、公社目前不可能组织集体生产的家庭小副业。
    由于这些家庭小副业一般都不需要多少时间和添置什么设备，也不需要多少生产资金，社员可以在不影响集体劳动的条件下，利用自己的休闲时间和旧有设备、经验去搞，所以发展得很快。河北吴桥县发展生猪的事实，就是一个很好的例子。吴桥县原来有七万五千多口猪，在贯彻集体生产为主、个人生产为辅的方针后，两个多月来就增加到十二万六千多口，发展的速度大大超过了以往。
    在集体生产的前提下，发展一些社员家庭的小副业，对国家对公社对社员都大有好处。首先，可以促进副业生产迅速发展，大大增加社会财富。社会总产品增加了，就能够更好地满足各方面的需要。其次，社员个人生产可以弥补集体生产的不足，除了社员家庭消费的以外，还可以拿出一部分来出售，供应市场满足社会需要。因此，在不影响集体生产和集体劳动的条件下，公社应该允许社员经营一些家庭小副业、养些猪鸡和种些蔬菜等，并给以必要的帮助和照顾。
    社员在集体生产之外再经营一些家庭小副业，会不会发展资本主义？可能，但是完全可以避免。因为我们现在有更有利的条件防止资本主义倾向发生了。只要人民公社正确贯彻党的关于社员经营家庭小副业的方针，根据各种副业生产的性质，统一计划、统一安排，哪些项目由公社经营，哪些项目由社员家庭经营，把社员家庭小副业纳入公社计划之内，就可以有力地防止资本主义倾向的发生。这是一。其次社员经营的家庭小副业只是为了补充集体生产的不足，所生产的东西只是少量的、零星的，只能部分地满足国家和城乡人民需要，对公社的集体生产和人民生活不能起决定性的作用。第三、社员个人的小自由首先要服从大集体，个人生产只能在不影响集体劳动的条件下进行，社员只能利用休闲时间搞自己的家庭小副业，不能占用集体劳动时间。公社领导上只要充分运用这些有利条件，对社员的个人生产加强具体领导，并不断对社员进行思想政治教育，使社员自觉地服从国家和公社的计划，社员经营的家庭小副业，就不仅产生不了资本主义，还能够为国家和城乡人民需要服务。
