Walking on Two Legs in Opera Repertoire
Zhang Geng

Opera work in 1958 achieved great results: Along with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, theatrical troupes went to the mountains and the countryside to perform for the people who were working hard on the production front. This both encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and their own enthusiasm, resulting in the creation of many repertoires reflecting the Great Leap Forward in production. These repertoires portrayed a variety of new characters and new scenes, possessing rich and colorful new ideas and new emotions, which indeed gave people a fresh feeling and sprouted a new artistic style.

This creative movement was extremely popular; it wasn't just a few professional playwrights who were involved, but almost all directors, actors, and even various personnel of the troupe were participating; not only the professional opera circle, but also many enthusiasts in communes and factories were involved. Because so many people were involved, many good repertoires emerged, which was a great achievement of the opera circle last year.

The achievement is great, but we cannot be satisfied with it. Just listen to the opinions of the audience, and you will know that they have more demands on us: one is that modern themes should be further improved; the other is that they also need to see excellent traditional repertoires.

Although many good new repertoires of modern opera were produced last year, there were also many rough works, plain and boring, that did not attract audiences. Although this is an inevitable phenomenon in mass creation, it is a phenomenon that must be improved for the audience. I think that during the Great Leap Forward, some people in the opera circle seemed to have misunderstood the concept of "more, faster, better, and more economical." It seemed that the less time spent on a new play, the better the quality would be. Such a misunderstanding should be clarified. We can recall that the slogan of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in the drama circle was raised against some theaters that shut themselves off to "improve," and could not produce a play that was welcomed by the audience for several years. After this slogan was put forward, the drama circle went deep into the masses, opened its eyes, was infected with new emotions, and broke the idea of abstract improvement, so there have been such great achievements in the past year. I think everyone should pay attention to summarizing these experiences.

Crude and shoddy work will not produce good art. Good art always needs to be continuously processed after the performance. Our new repertoire should also strive to have a batch that can be continuously processed and become a preserved repertoire. The "more" in "more, faster, better, and more economical" does not only refer to those repertoires that are performed and then discarded, but more importantly, it refers to producing more good repertoires that can be preserved, which requires continuous improvement of the quality of new repertoires.

For the vast audience, the repertoire must be diverse and colorful, with plays reflecting current life and also excellent traditional repertoires. Eating the same dish every day, even if it is a delicacy, will become tiresome. The same is true for opera. Watching the same type of opera every day will become tiresome, especially if the stories of those operas are similar. Therefore, while creating modern life operas, we must also strengthen the work of organizing traditional repertoires. We did relatively little of this work in 1958, and in a few places, we did very little.

If we don't do this work, the audience will still demand to see traditional repertoires. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the proportion of traditional repertoires being staged has increased. However, there are not many newly excavated and organized repertoires from last year, and most of them are still rehashed old stuff from previous years. Some small theatrical troupes in individual places, because they do not have the independent strength to organize traditional repertoires, and the audience is eager to see them, therefore the repertoires they come up with are quite poor in ideology and art, and the stage image is not very clean. This also proves that if we do not pay attention to doing work in this area, a blank will appear in this area, and it is difficult to say whether what fills this blank is fragrant flowers or poisonous weeds. Do not the above things prove to us once again that only by walking on two legs in the repertoire problem can we better serve socialist construction and the broad masses of working people? If someone thinks that the larger the proportion of modern operas on the opera stage, the better the service to the people, so that when the proportion reaches 100%, it is considered the best service, then he must be thinking too naively, otherwise he knows too little about the actual situation of opera.

The relationship between excellent traditional repertoires and modern repertoires is not mutually exclusive. If traditional repertoires are done well, it is not detrimental to modern plays. On the contrary, in our organization of traditions, we will learn more and better things from it, and increase our ability to create modern new repertoires. Our learning from tradition, to this day, is not too much but too little. Although we have paid attention to using traditional artistic techniques when creating new repertoires last year, it is still very unskilled, not yet proficient, and there are still many half-baked places, which is precisely one of the aspects that our new repertoires need to improve.

Some people feel that traditional repertoires are not as good as modern repertoires in serving socialism better. I think this is an abstract statement. If the play is 100% modern theme, but the quality is not high and the audience does not like it, then its service purpose will not be achieved. Besides, why can't well-organized traditional repertoires, such as "Fifteen Strings of Cash," serve the needs of reality well?

I think the problem still lies in producing good plays, both good plays with modern themes and good plays with historical themes, both new creations and serious organization of traditional repertoires. These two aspects of work are originally parallel and complementary.

The great 1958 has passed, and the greater 1959 has arrived. In the new year, under the working spirit of walking on two legs, the opera circle will be closely linked with the broad masses, and it is expected that it will achieve greater results than last year.

### 戏曲剧目上的两条腿走路

    戏曲剧目上的两条腿走路
    张庚
    1958年戏曲工作上有很大的成绩：随着工农业的大跃进，剧团纷纷上山下乡为生产战线上紧张劳动的人们进行了演出，一面鼓舞了群众的干劲，一面鼓舞了自己的干劲，由此而创作出许多反映了生产大跃进的剧目来。这些剧目里，表现了多种多样的新人物、新景象，具备着丰富多彩的新思想、新感情，的确给人以清新的感觉，萌芽着一种新艺术作风。
    这个创作运动带着极广泛的群众性，不仅仅是少数职业剧作家动手，几乎绝大多数的导演、演员以至剧团的各种人员都在动手；不仅仅职业戏曲界动手，就是公社里、工厂里的许多爱好者，也都在动手。由于动手的人这样多，其中就出来了不少的好剧目，这是去年戏曲界一项很大的成绩。
    成绩是很大，但也不能就此满足。只要去听听观众的意见，就知道他们对我们还有更多的要求：一则是现代题材剧目还应当进一步提高；另一是，也还需要看优秀的传统剧目。
    现代戏去年虽然产生了不少好的新剧目，但粗糙的作品，平淡枯燥，不吸引观众的作品，也很不少。这虽然是大量创作中间必然的现象，但对观众来说，却是非改进不可的现象。我觉得在大跃进中间，戏曲界有些人对于多快好省似乎发生了一种误解，仿佛搞一个新戏花的时间越少就会在质量上越好，这样的误解是应当澄清的。可以回忆一下，戏剧界的多快好省口号是针对着有些剧院关起门来“提高”，几年排不出一个为观众所欢迎的戏而提出来的。这个口号提出来之后，戏剧界深入了群众，打开了眼界，感染了新的情绪，破除抽象搞提高的思想，因此一年以来才有这样大的成绩。这些经验我觉得大家都应当注意来总结。
    粗制滥造不会产生好的艺术，好的艺术总是需要在演出之后仍旧继续加工。我们的新剧目也应当争取有一批能够继续不断加工，成为保留剧目。多快好省的“多”不光是说那些演过就扔的剧目，更重要的还是说要更多地产生能保留的好剧目，这就要求不断提高新剧目的质量。
    对于广大的观众来说，剧目还必须多样多彩，要有反映当前生活的戏，也要有传统的优秀剧目。天天吃一样菜，就是珍馐美味也会吃腻了的。戏也一样，天天看一类题材的戏也会看腻，如果那些戏的故事又只是大同小异的话，就更是如此。所以在创作现代生活戏的同时，还必须加强整理传统剧目的工作。这个工作，我们在1958年是做得比较少，有少数地方是做得很少的。
    我们不来做这个工作，观众还是要求看传统剧目。从去年第四季度以来，传统剧目的上演比例就多起来了。可是没有多少去年新挖掘整理的剧目，绝大多数还是炒前几年的陈饭。有个别地方的小剧团，由于自己没有独立整理传统剧目的力量，而观众又迫切要求看，因此拿出来的剧目在思想上和艺术上都相当差，舞台形象上也不是很干净。这也证明我们如不注意在这方面做工作，这方面就会出来空白，而填充这块空白的却很难说是香花还是毒草了。以上的事情岂不给我们又一次证明了在剧目问题上只有用两条腿走路才能做到给社会主义建设、给广大的劳动人民服务得更好吗？如果有人觉得只有戏曲舞台上现代戏的比例越大，才算给人民服务得越好，以至于比例达到了百分之百的时候，就算服务得最好的话，那他一定是想得太天真了，否则就是对戏曲的实际情况了解太少。
    优秀传统剧目和现代剧目之间的关系并不是互不相容互相排斥的关系，传统剧搞好了，并不是对于现代剧的不利，相反的，在我们整理传统中间就会从它学习到更多更好的东西，给我们创造现代新剧目增加本事。我们向传统的学习，到今天为止，还不是太多而是太不够。虽然在去年创造新剧目的时候，已经注意到运用传统的艺术手法，但是还很不熟练，还没有到家，还有许多夹生的地方，这也正是我们新剧目需要提高的方面之一。
    有人觉得传统剧目总不及现代剧目那样能更好地为社会主义服务，我看这是抽象的说法，如果戏是百分之百的现代题材了，而质量却不高，观众不喜爱，那它的服务目的也就达不到。再说，经过很好整理的传统剧目，如“十五贯”这样的，为什么就不能很好地为现实的需要服务呢？
    我看问题还在于搞出好戏来，既要现代题材的好戏，也要历史题材的好戏，既要新创作，也要认真整理传统剧目，这两方面的工作原是并行不悖，相辅相成的。
    伟大的1958年过去了，更伟大的1959年已经到来，戏曲界在新的一年中，在两条腿走路的工作精神之下，和广大群众密切联系起来，可以预计，会得到比去年更大的成绩。
