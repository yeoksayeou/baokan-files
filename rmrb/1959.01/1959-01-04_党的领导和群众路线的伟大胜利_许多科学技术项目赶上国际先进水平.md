Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: In the great leap forward of 1958, China's science and technology achieved accomplishments surpassing any previous year. Just a few years ago, modern emerging science and technology were either blank or very weak links in our country. Now we have rapidly mastered several departments, and many projects have approached or caught up with international advanced levels. In the field of atomic energy science, in addition to atomic reactors and ? particle cyclotrons, nuclear emulsions used to record various radiation traces, a "hundred-channel pulse analyzer" used to measure radiation energy distribution, and high-vacuum technology essential for the development of the atomic energy industry, especially conducive to the study of thermonuclear reactions, have reached a high level. The recently manufactured "non-contact long-distance control, measurement, and signal integrated equipment" is an advanced automatic control technology used in aviation, hydroelectric power stations, railways, meteorology, oil wells, and other fields. Artificial rainfall, artificial cloud creation, and artificial fog dissipation have been successfully tested in northern, northwestern, and southern regions of China.

Metallurgical science aims to promote the advancement of the steel industry. The research on intensifying iron smelting in blast furnaces and steelmaking in open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces has yielded important results, which, when popularized, may double the output of existing equipment.

In order to better develop and utilize the country's underground treasures, several disciplines have made contributions. In the field of electronics, the method of well logging using ultrasound has been successfully developed. In the field of geology, China's first self-made mass spectrometer has recently been installed. In the study of rare and dispersed element resources, the nature of China's rare and dispersed element deposits has been basically determined; a large number of mineral occurrences have been inspected and evaluated, and industrial evaluations have been made for several large rare element bases; a summary report has been written for the investigation and research in the Qilian Mountains; a metallogenic prediction map has been drawn; and the tectonic map of China has been preliminarily completed. In the field of paleontology, a stratigraphic correlation table for Chinese regions has been compiled, providing stratigraphic basis for geological surveys, mapping, and construction engineering design.

The synthesis of petroleum from water gas is an important scientific achievement in the chemical industry. China's production rate of synthesizing petroleum from water gas is 201 grams of product per cubic meter of pure water gas, which is a very high level internationally. It is economically worthwhile and opens up a good path for artificial petroleum. A new type of synthetic rubber with excellent oil resistance and cold resistance—butadiene-pyridine rubber—has also been successfully trial-produced. In addition, friction welding, magnesia-alumina bricks, non-clinker cement, nylon 9, high-yield carding machines, and high-strength low-alloy steel are all new achievements listed among the international advanced ranks.

In agriculture, Chinese farmers have created unprecedented high-yield technologies in the world. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and the "Less Planting, High Yield, and More Harvest" cultivation system derived from farmers' production practices are valuable creations. Scientific workers have created a new type of fertilizer that can promote crop growth and prevent various crop diseases—antibiotic fertilizer—which has been promoted and applied. Scientific achievements such as deep plowing tools, rope-drawn plows, rice transplanters, paddy field tractors, and saline-alkali soil improvement, as well as the successful research by fish scientists on artificial spawning of bighead carp and silver carp and methods to induce carp to spawn in winter, are all valuable in agricultural and fishery production.

Many cutting-edge achievements in world medicine have been gradually mastered in our country. For example, extracorporeal circulation (extracorporeal circulation of blood) used in direct vision heart surgery and the treatment of large-area burns have satisfactory clinical effects. New antibiotics with a wide range of treatments, such as erythromycin, tetracycline for anti-tuberculosis, and veterinamycin for veterinary use, can now be produced in our country. Our production technology of chlortetracycline has reached a very high level. We have found a new method that can increase the unit yield from the original 2,000 units to 6,500 units. In the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine, some effective treatment methods have also been discovered recently.

The above are just some of the important scientific and technological achievements of China's Great Leap Forward in 1958. These scientific and technological harvests are the victory of the Party's leadership and the Party's mass line. The scientific and technological community firmly believes that in 1959, as long as we rely closely on the Party's leadership, better implement the Party's mass line, carry out mass movements for scientific and technological research, and promote the style of daring to think and act combined with seeking truth from facts, we will surely achieve new scientific and technological achievements that surpass 1958.

    党的领导和群众路线的伟大胜利
    许多科学技术项目赶上国际先进水平
    据新华社3日讯　1958年大跃进的一年中，我国科学技术取得了胜过以往任何一年的成就。数年前，近代新兴科学技术在我国还都是空白或十分薄弱的环节，现在我们已经迅速掌握了若干部门，并且有许多项目接近或赶上了国际先进水平。在原子能科学方面，除了原子核反应堆和?粒子回旋加速器外，用于记录各种射线踪迹的原子核乳胶、用于测量射线能量分布的“百道脉冲分析器”，以及发展原子能事业所不可缺少的、特别是有助于研究热核反应的高真空技术，都已具有较高水平。最近制成的“无触点远距离控制、测量、信号综合设备”，是用于航空、水电站、铁路、气象、石油井等方面的一种先进的自动控制技术。人工降水、人工造云和人工消雾已在我国北部、西北部和长江以南等地区试验成功。
    冶金科学是以促进钢铁元帅升帐作为奋斗目标的。强化高炉炼铁和平炉、电炉炼钢的研究得出了重要成果，将来推广以后，可能使原有设备的产量翻一番。
    为了更好地开发利用祖国地下宝藏，好几门学科作出了贡献。电子学方面，研究成功了用超声波测井的方法。地质学方面，我国自制的第一台质谱仪最近刚安装完成。稀有分散元素资源的研究方面，已经基本上肯定了我国稀有分散元素矿床的性质；检查、评价了大批矿点，并且对若干大型稀有元素基地作出了工业评价；对于祁连山地区的调查研究，已写出总结报告；绘制了成矿预测图；中国大地构造图也已经初步完成。古生物学方面，编制了中国区域地层对比表，为地质普查制图及建设工程设计提供了地层根据。
    水煤气合成石油，是化学工业上的一项重要科学成果。我国水煤气合成石油的生产率是每立方公尺纯水煤气得到二百零一克产品，这在国际上是一个很高的水平。经济上很合算，为人造石油开辟了一条很好的途径。具有优良耐油性和耐寒性的新型合成橡胶——丁吡橡胶也已试制成功。此外，摩擦焊接、镁铝砖、无熟料水泥、尼龙9、高产量梳棉机、高强度低合金钢等，也都是列入国际先进行列的新成就。
    农业方面，我国农民创造了世界上空前的高产技术。农民们在生产实践中得出的
  “农业八字宪法”和“少种高产多收”的耕作制度，是很有价值的创举。科学工作者创造了一种能促进作物生长并且可以防治作物多种病害的新式肥料——抗生菌肥料，已经推广应用。深耕农具、绳索牵引犁、水稻插秧机、水田拖拉机、盐碱土改良等科学成果以及鱼类科学工作者研究成功的鳙鱼、鲢鱼人工产卵和促使鲤鱼冬季产卵的方法，在农业和渔业生产上都很有价值。
    世界医学中不少尖端成就，我国已经逐步掌握。例如作心脏直视手术时采用的体外循环（血液的体外循环）、大面积烧伤的治疗等都有满意的临床效果。治疗范围很广泛的红霉素、抗结核菌的四环素、兽用地霉素等新抗菌素我国都已能生产。金霉素的生产技术我们已达到很高水平，我们找到了一种新的方法，可使单位产量从原来的二千单位提高到六千五百单位。在中医宝库中，近来也发掘出了一些疗效显著的治疗方法。
    以上列举的，只是1958年我国大跃进中重要科学技术成就的一部分。这些科学技术的丰收，是党的领导和党的群众路线的胜利。科学技术界深信，1959年只要紧紧依靠党的领导，更好地贯彻党的群众路线，开展科学技术研究的群众运动，发扬敢想敢干同实事求是相结合的作风，一定会取得胜过1958年的科学技术新成就。（附图片）
