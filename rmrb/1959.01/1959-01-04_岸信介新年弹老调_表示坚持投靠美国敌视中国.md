Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 3rd: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in a statement to reporters in Ise City on the 2nd, reiterated his intention to continue adhering to an attitude of reliance on the United States and pursuing a policy of hostility towards China.

Kishi Nobusuke said: "Considering the current international situation, Japan should adhere to the 'free' position, and not adopt a neutral policy or a vague attitude of not standing on either side."

When discussing the issue of negotiations with the United States to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Kishi Nobusuke said that there are still two or three issues unresolved in the Japan-U.S. negotiations, including the issue of the area to which the treaty applies. He stated that if these issues are resolved, he would like to sign the treaty as soon as possible. As for the date of submitting the revised treaty to the Japanese Diet for approval, he would like to handle it by "carefully considering" the Diet's deliberation of the budget bill and this year's House of Councillors election. Kishi Nobusuke has been eager to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," expand the area of application of the treaty, and make Japan a cat's paw for the United States in its aggression plans in the Far East. However, Kishi Nobusuke's conspiracy has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people and has been delayed.

When reporters asked Kishi Nobusuke how he planned to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, he continued to resort to the tactic of accusing the victim, slandering China for "interfering in internal affairs," and saying that as long as China does not stop "activities that attempt to politically influence Japan and interfere in internal affairs, there is no way to break the deadlock."

At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke also indicated that he has not abandoned his conspiracy to restore fascist rule domestically. He told reporters: "Although I am not considering submitting the 'Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill' immediately after the resumption of the regular session of the Diet, my belief that it is necessary to revise the 'Police Officer Duties Execution Law' has not changed."

    岸信介新年弹老调
    表示坚持投靠美国敌视中国
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介2日在伊势市向记者发表谈话，再次表示了他要继续坚持投靠美国的态度和继续奉行敌视中国的政策。
    岸信介说：“考虑到当前的国际形势，日本就应该坚持‘自由’的立场，而不采取中立政策或者不站在两个阵营中的任何一边那样一种含糊的态度。”
    岸信介在谈到同美国进行修改日美“安全条约”的谈判问题时说，日美谈判还有两三个问题没有解决，其中包括条约适用地区的问题。他表示，如果这些问题得出了结论，他想尽早签字。至于把修改后的条约提交日本国会通过的日期，他想“斟酌”国会审议预算案等的情况和今年参议院选举等来加以处理。岸信介一直急于想修改日美“安全条约”，扩大条约适用地区，使日本为美国在远东的侵略计划火中取栗。但是，岸信介的这个阴谋遭到日本人民的强烈反对而被拖延下来。
    当记者问岸信介准备怎样来打开日中关系的僵局的问题时，他继续耍弄反咬一口的手法，诬蔑中国“干涉内政”，并且说甚么中国一天不停止“想在政治上影响日本的活动和干涉内政的活动，（僵局）就一天没有办法打开”。
    同时，岸信介还表示他也没有放弃对内恢复法西斯统治的阴谋。他对记者说：“虽然我不考虑在国会平时会议复会以后就立即提出（“警察官职务执行法修正案”），但是我认为有必要修改‘警职法’这个信念并没有改变。”
