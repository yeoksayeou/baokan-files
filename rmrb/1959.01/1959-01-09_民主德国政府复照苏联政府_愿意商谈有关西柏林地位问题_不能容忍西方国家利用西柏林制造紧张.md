Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th - The government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) stated in a reply to the Soviet government today that it agrees with and supports the Soviet government's proposal for resolving the West Berlin issue. That is, "delegations from the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union will, at an appropriate time, discuss various issues related to a peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue, and the date of the discussion can be determined through diplomatic channels."

The reply stated: "Now is the time to normalize the situation in West Berlin, thereby eliminating a dangerous center of international tension."

The GDR government's note is a response to the Soviet government's note of November 27, 1958. It was delivered to Soviet Ambassador P.A. Pervukhin on the 7th by Deputy Foreign Minister Wenzel.

The reply emphasized that the GDR government believes that the current abuse of West Berlin can no longer be tolerated.

The reply stated: "The GDR government is willing to discuss all issues related to the peaceful resolution of the West Berlin issue and the transfer of responsibilities temporarily performed by Soviet institutions, and is willing to discuss issues related to the Federal Republic of Germany and other relevant countries with representatives of those countries—just as the democratic municipal authorities of Greater Berlin are willing to discuss with the West Berlin parliament—and to conclude corresponding agreements."

The reply recounted that the GDR government has already announced its agreement to establish West Berlin as a free city, although it would be legitimate and natural to place West Berlin entirely under the sovereignty of the GDR, where it is located. It agreed to do so in the interest of peace.

The reply stated that the establishment of a free city of West Berlin would bring important experience for the establishment of a confederation of the two German states. In addition, such a solution will also have a beneficial impact on the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany.

The reply pointed out that it would be in the national interest of the German people if West Germany and West Berlin were willing to act in the same spirit as the GDR and were willing to contribute to a peaceful solution to the West Berlin issue. "However, there is no indication of a willingness to do so on the part of the rulers of West Germany and West Berlin. On the contrary, these people are doing everything they can to prevent a solution to the problem and are trying to gain the support of all NATO countries." The reply stated that NATO's involvement in the West Berlin issue is seen as an attempt to subject other countries to the aggressive and provocative policies of the United States and West Germany.

The reply concluded: "The GDR government welcomes the Soviet government's assurance that its future relations with the German people will also be based on mutual respect and cooperation on the basis of equal rights. This assurance has nothing in common with the occupation regime."

"The GDR government is convinced that all policies that violate the interests of peace and European security are doomed to failure, and it welcomes with satisfaction the declaration that any act of aggression against the GDR or other socialist countries will be met with a devastating blow from the Warsaw Treaty countries."

### 民主德国政府复照苏联政府  愿意商谈有关西柏林地位问题  不能容忍西方国家利用西柏林制造紧张

    民主德国政府复照苏联政府
    愿意商谈有关西柏林地位问题
    不能容忍西方国家利用西柏林制造紧张
    新华社柏林7日电　德意志民主共和国政府今天在给苏联政府的一份复照中表示同意和支持苏联政府关于解决西柏林问题的建议，即“由德意志民主共和国和苏联两国政府代表团在适当的时间就同和平解决西柏林问题有关的各种问题进行商谈，商谈的日期可以通过外交途径来规定”。
    这份复照说：“现在正是使西柏林局势正常化从而消灭国际紧张局势的一个危险的中心的时候了。”
    德意志民主共和国政府的这份照会是对苏联政府1958年11月27日的照会的答复。它已经由外交部副部长文策尔在7日交给了苏联大使别尔乌辛。
    复照强调说，德意志民主共和国政府认为目前的滥用西柏林的情况再也不能容忍下去了。
    复照说：“德意志民主共和国政府愿意商谈所有与和平解决西柏林问题和接管由苏联机构暂时执行的职责有关的问题，愿意同德意志联邦共和国和其他有关国家的代表商谈与这些国家有关的问题——正像大柏林民主市政当局愿意同西柏林议会商谈一样——并且缔结相应的协定。”
    复照追述说，德意志民主共和国政府已经宣布同意设立西柏林自由城市，虽然把西柏林完全置于它的所在地德意志民主共和国的主权之下是合法而自然的事。它同意这样做是为了和平的利益。
    复照说，西柏林自由城市的建立将会为建立两个德国的邦联带来重要的经验。此外，这样一种解决办法还将对准备对德和约的工作发生有利的影响。
    复照指出，如果西德和西柏林愿意以和德意志民主共和国相同的精神来行动，并且愿意对和平解决西柏林问题作出贡献的话，这将是符合德国人民的民族利益的。“但是在西德和西柏林的统治者方面却看不出愿意这样做的表示。正相反，这些人却在尽一切力量来阻止问题的解决，并且试图取得所有北大西洋公约组织国家的支持。”复照说，北大西洋公约组织牵涉到西柏林问题中的事被认为是一种要把其他国家听命于美国和西德的侵略性和挑衅性政策的企图。
    复照最后说：“德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联政府的这种保证，即它将来同德国人民的关系也将以互相尊重和在平等权利的基础上合作为基础。这种保证与占领制度毫无共同之处。”
    “德意志民主共和国政府坚信，所有违反和平与欧洲安全的利益的政策都是注定要失败的，它满意地欢迎这样一种声明：对德意志民主共和国或者其他社会主义国家的侵略行动都将遭到华沙条约国家的毁灭性的打击。”
