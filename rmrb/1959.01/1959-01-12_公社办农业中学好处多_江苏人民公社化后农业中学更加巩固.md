Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 11th. Agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province have been further consolidated since the people's communes were established. Recently, agricultural middle schools throughout the province have shown a thriving new atmosphere. Local reports indicate that communes running agricultural middle schools have many benefits.

After the people's communes were established, agricultural middle schools in various places became directly affiliated cultural and educational institutions of the communes. The commune party organizations strengthened their leadership over the agricultural middle schools. For larger agricultural middle schools, the commune party committees also dispatched the original small township party committee secretaries or committee members to serve as full-time principals. In Taixing County, fourteen central agricultural middle schools have full-time party member principals. The county party committees of Jiangdu, Tongshan, and other counties decided that all agricultural middle schools without full-time party member principals should be equipped with them as soon as possible.

With the adjustment and merger of township and commune administrative regions after the communization, communes appropriately adjusted and merged schools with too few students and that were too scattered. Now, agricultural middle schools in each commune generally have two or more classes, with about forty students in each class. With more classes in the schools, there are also more teachers. Originally, some schools had one person teaching several subjects, but now there is generally a division of labor, allowing teachers to strengthen teaching research and improve teaching quality. Some schools have newly opened courses such as chemistry and physics. After the merger of agricultural middle schools, schools with the conditions of school buildings and dormitories implemented a student boarding system. Therefore, student attendance rates generally increased, generally reaching over 90%. There are no more late arrivals or early departures from class, and study time has generally increased. General schools have added forty minutes of morning reading in the morning, and two hours of self-study in the evening.

After the people's communes were established, the labor and teaching conditions of agricultural middle schools were greatly improved. Originally, some agricultural middle schools borrowed civilian houses or used classrooms in middle and primary schools for classes. Now, the communes have uniformly allocated school buildings. Some places, in conjunction with the adjustment of residential areas, have not only solved the teaching rooms for agricultural middle schools, but also the housing for teachers and students. Originally, some of the agricultural middle schools' experimental fields were scattered. Now, the communes have mostly allocated contiguous, good fields close to the schools, providing extremely favorable conditions for agricultural middle schools to develop production, improve teaching quality, and carry out scientific research. Many schools have established farms and factories, and also developed sideline production such as raising pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and growing vegetables. Students in agricultural middle schools throughout the province are developing into versatile individuals who can both farm and work.

After the communes implemented free meals, the lives of teachers and students in agricultural middle schools became stable, and the morale of teachers and students was very high. In the past, some schools had to hold classes during work breaks such as the morning shift, evening shift, and noon shift in order to take care of students earning work points. Now, parents of agricultural middle school students no longer need to keep their children at home to earn work points. Agricultural middle schools have established a more regular work-study system. Some work half a day and study half a day; some work every other day and study every other day. Teachers' families have joined the communes and also enjoy the free meals, and many teachers have expressed their intention to "be red in agricultural middle school, and be specialized in agricultural middle school." After the communization, some communes transferred agricultural middle school students to work as accountants, childcare workers, etc. After the provincial party committee pointed this out, this situation has stopped developing.

After the mass steelmaking campaign, autumn harvest, autumn planting, and deep plowing movements this semester, most schools resumed normal teaching work at the end of October and the beginning of November last year. Now, general schools have had seven or eight weeks of classes, and some schools have had eleven or twelve weeks of classes. Many schools, based on the principle of learning less when busy and learning more when idle, are currently increasing teaching time, strengthening teaching, and actively moving towards the goal of "teaching surpassing general middle schools, and production surpassing veteran farmers."

    公社办农业中学好处多
    江苏人民公社化后农业中学更加巩固
    新华社南京11日电　江苏省人民公社化以后，农业中学更加巩固了。最近全省农业中学出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。各地反映：公社办农业中学好处很多。
    人民公社化以后，各地农业中学都成为公社的直属文教事业单位，公社党组织都加强了对农业中学的领导，对规模较大的农业中学，公社党委还把原来的小乡党委书记或党委委员派去担任专职的校长。泰兴县十四所中心农业中学都有了专职的党员校长。中共江都、铜山等县县委决定：凡是没有专职的党员校长的农业中学，最近都要配齐。
    随着公社化以后的乡、社行政区域的调整合并，公社把原来学生人数过少和分散的学校，作了适当的调整、合并。现在各公社的农业中学，一般都有两个班级以上，每个班级有四十人左右。学校的班级多了，教师也多了。原来有些学校一人担任几门课，现在大都有了分工，使教师有可能加强教学研究和提高教学质量。有的学校已经新开了化学、物理等课。农业中学合并以后，校舍、宿舍有条件的学校，实行了学生住校制，因此学生出席率普遍提高，一般都达90％以上。上课迟到早退的现象没有了，学习时间普遍增加。一般学校早晨增加了四十分钟早读，晚上有两小时的自修。
    人民公社化以后，大大改善了农业中学的劳动和教学条件。原来有些农业中学借用民房、或是借用中、小学的教室上课的，现在公社都统一拨了校舍。有的地方结合居民点的调整，不但解决了农中的教学用房，而且连师生住房也一并解决了。原来有些农中的试验田是零星分散的，现在公社大都拨了连片的、离学校近的好田，为农业中学发展生产、提高教学质量和开展科学研究等工作提供了极为有利的条件。许多学校办了农场、工厂，还开展了养猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭、兔和种植蔬菜等副业生产。全省各农业中学的学生正向着既会种田、也会做工的多面手方面发展。
    公社实行吃饭不要钱以后，农业中学的师生生活安定了，教师与学生的情绪都很高涨。过去有些学校为了照顾学生挣工分，只好在早班、晚班、午班等工间休息的时候上课。现在农中学生的家长再不用留子弟在家挣工分了，农业中学都建立起比较正规的半工半读制度。有的半日劳动，半日读书；有的隔日劳动，隔日读书。教师家属参加了公社，也享受吃饭不要钱的待遇，许多教师都表示要“红在农中、专在农中”。公社化以后，有的公社把农业中学学生调作会计、保育员等工作，经省委指出后，这种情况已停止发展。
    这学期经过全民炼钢铁、秋收、秋种、深翻土地等运动后，绝大部分学校都于去年10月底、11月初恢复了正常的教学工作。现在一般学校都上了七、八周的课，多的学校已上课十一、二周。不少学校根据忙时少学、闲时多学的原则，目前都增加教学时间，加强教学，积极向“教学超普中，生产赛老农”的目标前进。
