    Publishing Work Needs Book Review Guidance
    Yi Dingshan
    Book review work is very important to our publishing industry. However, in the past year or two, there have been fewer book reviews in newspapers and periodicals. The main problem currently existing in book review work is that everyone is not paying enough attention to it. Now that publications are increasing day by day, book reviews are even more important. Book reviews should play a guiding role for publishing work. Take our Commercial Press, for example. Every year we publish hundreds of new and reprinted books, and there must be some that are worth reviewing. For example, our "Farmer's Dictionary" has already printed 500,000 copies last year, which was not enough. Now we are adding another 500,000 copies, and this year we will print several million copies. For books with such a large number of publications, we very much hope that everyone will offer some opinions for reference when reprinting.
    Comments on book reviews are also very important. For example, this year we will publish some world-renowned academic works, and each book has a preface, which is a book review. We very much hope that these book reviews can be commented on.
    In terms of language books, we will publish various dictionaries and lexicons this year, some of which are large foreign language dictionaries, and we also very much hope to get reviews.

    出版工作需要书评指导
    易定山
    书评工作对于我们出版界关系很大。但是，近一两年来，报刊上的书评少了一些。大家对书评工作注意不够，这是目前书评工作中存在的主要问题。现在出版物日益增加，书评就更加显得重要了。书评对出版工作应该起指导的作用。就以我们商务印书馆来说，每年出版几百种新版书和重版书，一定有值得评论的。例如，我们出版的“农民字典”，去年已印了五十万册，不够，现在又加印五十万册，今年要印到几百万册。对于出版数量这样大的书，我们很希望大家提一些意见，以作重印时的参考。
    对书评的评论也很重要。例如，今年我们要出版一些世界学术名著，书前都有一篇序言，这序言就是书评，我们很希望能对这些书评加以评论。
    在语文书籍方面，我们今年将出版各种字典和辞典，其中有些是大型的外文辞典，也很希望能得到评论。
