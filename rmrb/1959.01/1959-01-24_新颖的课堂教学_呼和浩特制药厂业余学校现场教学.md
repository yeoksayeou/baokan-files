Novel Classroom Teaching
——On-site Teaching at the Hohhot Pharmaceutical Factory Spare-time School
　　Three People (三人)
I attended a technical class at the Hohhot Pharmaceutical Factory's spare-time school, and it was a novel classroom teaching method. The classroom was in the boiler workshop, and the lesson was about the components of a boiler and their functions.

The boiler workshop was in full production, with three of the four boilers blazing with fire. The students stood in front of the one that was shut down. The lecturer was not a full-time teacher, nor a technician, but an old worker from the boiler workshop - Master Li. This large boiler became the best visual aid, and the boiler itself became the blackboard. When Master Li talked about a component, he wrote its name on or beside it with chalk. From front to back, from bottom to top, he explained each component one by one, and his explanation was very clear. When he talked about the pressure gauge and water level gauge, the water level gauge on the adjacent boiler was showing the water level, and the pointer of the pressure gauge was pointing to "2". The students nodded constantly as Master Li lectured. Sometimes Master Li would demonstrate to the students. When he explained the function of the lever-type safety valve, he saw that some students didn't quite understand, so he ran to another boiler and pressed the weight of the safety valve with his hand, and the steam whistle sounded a warning. This kind of on-site teaching enabled the students to have a clear understanding of the structure of the boiler and the function of each component within an hour.

After the workshop teaching, the students returned to the classroom, where the technician (part-time teacher for technical classes) served as the teacher. The class was conducted based on the teaching content of the previous lesson, using question and discussion methods. The teacher asked the students to recall what they saw in the workshop just now, and asked them to describe the structure of the boiler from front to back, from bottom to top, part by part, and to explain its function clearly. The first student to be questioned was a carpenter, who was originally unfamiliar with boilers, but he basically answered the teacher's questions. While the student was answering, the teacher drew a diagram on the blackboard. After the students had answered completely, a sketch of a boiler was drawn on the blackboard. The teacher pointed to the sketch and systematically elaborated on the various components and their functions from a theoretical perspective. During the questioning, the students also discussed some issues. For example, when the teacher was talking about the water convection problem in a double-drum eccentric boiler, he made a mistake about the direction of convection. After the students raised the issue for discussion, the problem was clarified, which enabled both the teacher and the students to gain a deeper understanding. Finally, the teacher summarized. It only took an hour in total. The entire teaching of "the components of the boiler and their functions" was completed within two hours.

After the students left the classroom, they all said in unison: "This class was well taught, learned quickly, and remembered firmly." Indeed, judging from the classroom questioning, the teaching objective had been achieved, and the students had basically mastered the content of this lesson. Even I, an outsider who knew nothing about boilers, also mastered the knowledge of boilers by listening in. (Originally published in the Inner Mongolia Daily)

    新颖的课堂教学
    ——呼和浩特制药厂业余学校现场教学
    三人
    在呼和浩特市制药厂业余学校听了一次技术课，这是一堂新颖的课堂教学。课堂在锅炉车间，讲的是锅炉的构件及其作用。
    锅炉车间正在生产，四个锅炉有三个还都是火光熊熊，学员们站在那一个停了火的锅炉前。讲课的不是专职教师，也不是技术员，却是一位锅炉车间老工人——李师傅。这个大锅炉变成了最好的直观教具，锅炉本身也就是黑板。李师傅讲到哪一个构件时，同时也就用粉笔在上面或旁边写上它的名字。从前到后，从下到上，一个构件一个构件的讲解，讲的条理非常清楚。讲气压表、水位表时，旁边锅炉上的水位表正表示着水位，气压表的指针也正在指着“2”。李师傅讲课时，学员们都不断地点头。有时李师傅还做给学员看。讲杠杆式安全阀的作用时，他看到有的学员不太明白，就跑到另一个锅炉上用手一压安全阀的砣，汽笛就发出了呜呜的警报。这种现场教学，使学员们在一小时内对锅炉的构造以及各个构件的作用，有了清晰明确的认识。
    车间教学以后，学员们又都回到了教室，这时候由技术员（技术课兼课教师）担任教师。根据上一课的教学内容以提问并结合讨论方式上课。教师让学员回忆刚才在车间看到的情况，让学员把锅炉的构造从前到后，从下到上，一部分一部分地叙述出来，并要讲清楚其作用。首先被提问的学员是一个木工，原来他对锅炉是很生疏的，但却基本上回答了教师的提问。学员一边回答，教师一边在黑板上画图，学员们回答完全了，黑板上也画成了一个锅炉的草图。教师指着草图，又从理论上系统地阐述了各个构件及其作用。在提问的同时，学员们对有些问题还进行了讨论。如教师讲双筒偏心锅炉里水的对流问题时，讲错了对流的方向，经学员提出讨论，弄清了问题，使教师和学员都得到了进一步的理解。最后，教师归纳总结。总共只用了一个小时。整个“锅炉的构件及其作用”的全部教学，在两小时内便结束了。
    学员们走出教室以后，不约而同地说：“这堂课教的好，学的快，记的牢。”的确，从课堂提问来看，教学目的已经达到，学员们都基本上掌握了这一堂课的内容。我这个对锅炉一窍不通的门外汉，通过旁听，也掌握了锅炉的知识。（原载内蒙古日报）
