    Labor
    Liu Mianzhi
    The word "labor" first appeared in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, but its original meaning referred to physical activity, which is different from today's productive industrial and agricultural labor.
        Records of the Three Kingdoms, Book of Wei, Biography of Hua Tuo, volume 29:
        Hua Tuo told Wu Pu of Guangling: "The human body should labor, but not too
    much. Physical activity facilitates digestion, blood circulation, and prevents disease. The
    hinges of doors and windows do not rot because they are constantly moving, which is the same principle.
        Therefore, ancient immortals emphasized guiding exercises, learning to stretch the neck like a bear, shaking the head like an owl, bending the waist,
    and moving the joints to avoid aging.
        I have a set of exercises called the Five Animal Frolics. The first is the tiger, the second is the deer, the third is the bear,
    the fourth is the monkey, and the fifth is the bird. Practicing them daily can eliminate illness, lighten the steps, and the principle is the same as guiding exercises. When the body is uncomfortable, perform one of the animal frolics, sweat all over, apply talcum powder, and the body becomes lighter, and the appetite also improves.
        Wu Pu learned the Five Animal Frolics and lived to be over ninety years old, still with sharp ears and eyes, and intact teeth, benefiting greatly.
    Guiding exercises probably involve deep breathing. Judging from the text, ancient immortals should have been accomplished athletes. Hua Tuo's theory is completely in line with today's sports science. It is a dialectical statement to engage in physical activity, but not to overdo it. Regular physical exercise facilitates digestion, blood circulation, thereby strengthening the body and preventing diseases. From this, it can be seen that Hua Tuo was not only an outstanding physician of internal and surgical medicine, but also a progressive medical scientist who advocated prevention first. Particularly noteworthy and worthy of study is his theory of physical activity, a dialectical and scientific sports theory.
    The word "labor" also appears in Bai Juyi's poem of the Tang dynasty: "Laboring my old friend, Elder Pang, bringing fish and wine from afar to visit me." Here, "laboring" means "troubling," and expresses gratitude.
    The etymology of the modern word "labor" is a foreign word, from Japanese. Just like the word "transformation" is from Japanese. In Japanese, workers are called "roudousha" (勞働者), and when translated into Chinese, the "person" radical of the character 働 is removed. Through the development of China's industry and the growth of the working class, the word "labor" has acquired new meaning and become our own vocabulary.

    劳动
    刘勉之
    劳动这一个词始见于三国志，但原意是指的体育活动，和今天的生产性的工农业劳动是两回事。
        三国志魏志二十九华佗传：
        华佗告诉广陵人吴普说：“人的身体应该劳动，但是不应该太
    过。身体活动了就容易消化，血脉流通，病不得生。门窗的枢，因
    为经常动，就不会朽，就是这个道理。
        所以古时的仙人，讲究导引，学熊引颈，学鸱摇头，曲折腰体，
    动诸关节，以求难老。
        我有一套运动办法，叫作五禽之戏。一曰虎、二曰鹿、三曰熊、
    四曰猨、五曰鸟，每天操作，可以除病，轻便脚步，道理和导引一
    样。身上不舒服时，起作一禽之戏，通身出汗，敷上爽身粉，身体
    轻便，胃口也好了。
        吴普学了五禽之戏，活到九十多岁，还是耳目聪明，牙齿完
    整，很得好处。
    导引大概就是作深呼吸，古代的仙人照文义看应该是有成就的运动员。华佗的理论完全符合今天的体育学说。要作体育活动，但又不要太过，是辩证的说法。经常作体育锻炼，容易消化，血脉流通，从而增强体质，起了预防疾病的作用。由此看来，华佗不但是治病的内、外科杰出的医生，并且是主张预防为主的进步的医学家。特别值得注意，值得学习的是他的体育活动的理论，辩证的科学的体育学说。
    劳动一词也见于唐白居易的诗：“劳动故人庞阁老，提鱼携酒远相寻。”这里的劳动有“有劳了”，和感谢的意思。
    现代语劳动一词的语源，是外来语，是日本话。正如改造是日本话一样。日本话叫工人作劳働者，译作我国文字，把働字的人旁去掉了。通过我国工业的发展，工人阶级队伍的壮大，劳动这一个词便具有新的内容，成为我们自己的词汇了。
