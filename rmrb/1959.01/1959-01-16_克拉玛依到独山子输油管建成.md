Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 15th: The Karamay to Dushanzi oil pipeline officially began transporting oil on the 10th. From now on, crude oil extracted from the Karamay oil field will be transported along this 147-kilometer pipeline to the Dushanzi refinery for processing into various petroleum products.

On the 10th, nearly 400 employee representatives from the Karamay mining area held a completion ceremony for the oil pipeline. Qi Guo, Standing Committee member of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Minister of Industry and Transportation, represented the Autonomous Region Party Committee and congratulated the workers who constructed the oil pipeline and expressed warm greetings.

After more than three years of drilling and development, the Karamay mining area has many oil wells in production. In the past, the crude oil produced here was transported to the Dushanzi refinery by trucks. Trucks could only make one trip a day, resulting in high costs and significant crude oil loss. In order to adapt to the rapid development of production in the Karamay mining area, transport crude oil to the Dushanzi refinery in a timely manner, and reduce crude oil transportation costs, construction of this oil pipeline began in May 1958. After more than seven months of intense construction, it was completed in December of last year.

The oil pipeline was constructed by the Xinjiang Engineering Brigade of the Yumen Oilfield Construction Engineering Company and relevant units of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.

    克拉玛依到独山子输油管建成
    新华社乌鲁木齐15日电　克拉玛依至独山子输油管道10日正式开始输油。从此以后，克拉玛依油矿开采的原油，就顺着这条长一百四十七公里的管道输送到独山子炼油厂，炼制成各种石油产品。
    10日，克拉玛依矿区近四百名职工代表，举行了输油管道落成典礼。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会常委、工业交通部部长祁果，代表自治区党委，在会上向建设输油管道的职工祝贺并表示热烈慰问。
    克拉玛依矿区经过三年多的钻探和开发，已有许多油井投入生产。过去，这里生产的原油，都是用汽车运往独山子炼油厂的，每天汽车只能运送一趟，成本高，原油损耗也大。为了适应克拉玛依矿区生产的迅速发展，及时将原油运到独山子炼油厂，降低原油运输成本，1958年5月便开始修建这条输油管道。经过七个多月的紧张施工，去年12月就建设完成。
    这条输油管道是由玉门油田建设工程公司新疆工程大队和新疆生产建设兵团的有关单位负责修建的。
