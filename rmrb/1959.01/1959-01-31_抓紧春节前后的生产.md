Grasp Production Before and After the Spring Festival
Commentator of This Newspaper

The Spring Festival is approaching. After a year of the Great Leap Forward, the people of the whole country are welcoming this traditional Chinese festival amidst congratulations on their victories.

During this Spring Festival, the vast majority of factories, mines, enterprises, and government offices across the country will be on holiday. Some employees will take advantage of the holiday to visit their long-separated relatives and see the tremendous changes in their hometowns, which is only natural. Some employees, after a year of hard work, will also take advantage of the holiday to enjoy a few days of pleasant rest and entertainment, which is also very natural. There is also a small number of employees in factories and mines who will continue production during the Spring Festival due to the needs of national construction and people's lives. For these employees who persist in production, this is a great honor. They sacrifice their own rest for the benefit of the country and the happiness of others, and they deserve our respect and thanks!

This year is a year of even greater leap forward for our country. In order to accomplish this year's production tasks, we must make even greater efforts, especially at the beginning, we should grasp production tightly. "A year's plan starts in spring," is an old Chinese saying. January of this year has passed, and February has only twenty-eight days. The Spring Festival is in this month, and the success or failure of completing the February production plan directly affects the completion of the first quarter plan. Therefore, in order to resolutely complete and overfulfill the February production plan, we require employees who are on Spring Festival leave to now work hard to maintain production. Once the Spring Festival holiday is over, immediately devote themselves to production with full energy. Employees who return home should also return to their production posts on time in accordance with the State Council's regulations on employees' home visit leave. To ensure this, employees must make good arrangements for their lives during the Spring Festival, not only to ensure good entertainment and rest, but also to quickly plunge into the high tide of the Great Leap Forward as soon as the holiday is over. All production enterprises and departments must arrange a portion of their workforce to earnestly do a good job in equipment maintenance and all preparations before production during the Spring Festival. Those that need to be overhauled should be overhauled during the holidays; those that need to be adjusted should be adjusted in a timely manner to ensure that employees can immediately resume normal production after the Spring Festival.

During the Spring Festival, some employees still need to persist in production, including the vast number of employees in national steel, coal mines, mines, coal washing, electricity, transportation, forestry, and service industries. This year, due to heavy transportation tasks, short-distance transportation and loading and unloading workers must also continue to work. In some areas, due to the tight power supply after the Great Leap Forward in production, the light industry and textile industry departments in these areas should take advantage of the favorable conditions of a relatively abundant power supply during the Spring Festival, when most factories and enterprises are on holiday, and strive to increase production to ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the first quarter production tasks, in order to supply the vast number of people with textiles and daily necessities. This year, the passenger and freight transport tasks are extremely heavy before, during, and after the Spring Festival. Therefore, the transportation departments must be good at rationally arranging and dispatching transport forces; passenger cars should not return empty due to improper dispatch, and every ton of transport capacity should be cherished so that every ton of cargo space can play its due role. We must try every means to fully tap the transportation potential to ensure the needs of production and life. This is the glorious task of the transportation department.

For factories, mines, enterprises and departments that do not have holidays during the Spring Festival, the relevant departments should pay special attention to their material and cultural needs, so that they can also have a good Spring Festival. Commercial departments should make every effort to do a good job in supplying these factories and mines, so that these employees who persist in their production posts can live better. Cultural departments should take the initiative to contact enterprises that do not take Spring Festival holidays, go deep into factories and mines, and perform wonderful programs for the employees. Leading cadres of various industrial and mining enterprises should be good at using the power of the masses, in the spirit of thrift, to arrange the cultural and recreational activities of the employees. So that employees can get adequate rest and entertainment after strenuous work.

To ensure that employees on Spring Festival leave persist in production before the Spring Festival, have a good rest during the Spring Festival, and strive for full attendance on the first day of production after the Spring Festival to get off to a flying start and ensure the completion of the February plan. To ensure that employees who do not take Spring Festival leave can work with full energy and achieve a greater leap forward, this requires the Party committees at all levels to strengthen ideological education for all employees, explain to the vast number of employees the importance of completing the February production plan for completing the first quarter plan and the annual plan, mobilize the vast number of employees to conduct a wide-ranging and in-depth discussion, and formulate some practical and specific measures to achieve the plan, which can guarantee that we can have a good rest during the Spring Festival and complete the production tasks well.

Today, there are only seven days left until the Spring Festival. All employees, we wish you a good rest and entertainment during the Spring Festival, and we hope that after the Spring Festival, you will work with full energy and strive for excellence to better complete the first quarter production plan and lay a good foundation for a greater leap forward in 1959.

    抓紧春节前后的生产
    本报评论员
    春节即将到来，全国人民经过了去年一年的大跃进，在祝贺胜利声中，来迎接这个我国人民传统的节日。
    今年春节期间，全国极大部分厂矿、企业机关，都要放假。一部分职工都要趁着假日，回家探望一下久别的亲人，看一看家乡的巨大变化，这也是人之常情。有些职工，在经过去年一年苦干后，也要趁着假期愉快地休息娱乐几天，这也是很自然的。还有一小部分厂矿企业的职工，由于国家建设和人民生活的需要，春节期间仍要坚持生产。对于这些坚持生产的职工们来说，这是莫大的光荣。他们为了国家利益、别人的欢乐而牺牲自己的休息，值得我们尊敬，我们要感谢他们！
    今年是我国更大跃进的一年。为了完成今年的生产任务，我们还要付出更大的努力，特别是在一开始就应该抓紧生产。“一年之计在于春”，这是我国人民的一句古话。今年1月份已经过去了，2月份只有二十八天，春节就在这个月里，2月份生产计划完成得好坏，直接影响着第一季度计划的完成。因此，为了坚决完成和超额完成2月份的生产计划，我们要求春节休假的职工们，现在一定要紧张地坚持生产。春节假期一过，立刻精力充沛地投入生产。回家的职工，也要按照国务院关于职工回家探亲假期的规定，准时回到生产岗位上来。要保证做到这样，职工们就一定要好好安排春节期间的生活，既要做到娱乐得好，休息得好，更要做到假期一满就迅速投入大跃进的高潮中去。各生产企业部门，必须要安排一部分人力在春节期间切实做好设备维护和生产前的一切准备工作。对需要检修的，要抓紧假期进行检修；需要调整的要及时调整，以保证职工们在春节后能立即正常生产。
    春节期间还仍然有一部分职工需要坚持生产，包括全国钢铁、煤矿、矿山、洗煤、电力、运输、林业以及服务性行业等岗位上的广大职工。今年由于运输任务繁重，短途运输和装卸工人也要坚持工作。还有某些地区，由于生产大跃进后电源供应比较紧张，这些地区的轻工业、纺织工业等部门，应趁着春节大部分工厂企业放假、电源供应比较充裕的有利条件，努力增产，保证第一季度生产任务的完成或超额完成，以供应广大人民对纺织品和日用品的需要。今年春节前后和春节期间，客运货运任务都极其繁重，因此，交通运输部门一定要善于合理地安排和调度运输力量；要使客运车不致因调度不当而空回，要珍惜每一吨运输力量，使每一吨货位都能发挥它应有的作用，要想尽一切办法充分挖掘运输潜力，保证生产、生活的需要，这是交通运输部门的光荣任务。
    对于春节期间不休假的厂矿企业部门，有关部门应该特别关心他们的物质和文化生活需要，让他们也能好好过春节。商业部门应该尽一切努力，做好对这些厂矿部门的供应工作，使这些坚持在生产岗位上的职工能生活得更好。文化部门要主动地和春节不休假的企业取得联系，深入厂矿，为职工们演出精彩的节目。各工矿企业的领导干部，要善于运用群众的力量，本着节约的原则，来安排好职工的文娱活动。使职工们在紧张劳动之后，能得到充分的休息、娱乐。
    要做到春节放假的职工们在春节前紧张地坚持生产，春节期间好好休息，春节开工第一天争取全勤生产开门红，确保2月份计划的完成。要春节不休假的职工能鼓足干劲，来一个更大的跃进，这就要求各级党委加强对全体职工的思想教育工作，向广大职工说明完成2月份生产计划对完成一季度计划和全年计划的重要性，发动全体职工群众进行一次广泛深入的讨论，并制定出一些实现计划的切实具体的措施，就能够保证做到春节期间休息得好，生产任务完成得好。
    今天离开春节只有七天了，全体职工们，我们预祝你们在春节期间休息好、娱乐好，更希望你们春节后要鼓足干劲、力争上游，更好地完成第一季度生产计划，为1959年更大的跃进打下良好的基础。
