    The statement said that the victory achieved by the Cuban democratic forces has great significance for the entire Latin American continent. Another bastion of autocratic violence has collapsed, another servant of U.S. imperialism has been overthrown, and the people of all countries are elated. This is a powerful blow against the reactionary groups in Cuba and throughout Latin America.
    The statement said that the collapse of the Batista regime is also a failure for (Dominican dictator) Trujillo, who, under the protection of U.S. imperialism, provided assistance to Batista.
    The statement called on the democratic forces in Cuba and throughout Latin America to support the Dominican people's struggle for democracy.

The purpose of this organization is to oppose the dictatorial regimes that still exist in Latin America, and first of all to help Dominicans gain freedom.

    声明说，古巴民主力量所取得的胜利对整个拉丁美洲大陆有巨大的意义。又一个专制暴力的堡垒崩溃了，又一个美帝国主义的奴仆被赶下台了，各国人民对此感到兴高采烈。这是对古巴以及整个拉丁美洲的反动集团的有力打击。
    声明说，巴蒂斯塔政权的崩溃也就是（多米尼加独裁者）特鲁希略的失败，他曾经在美帝国主义的庇护下向巴蒂斯塔提供援助。
    声明呼吁古巴和整个拉丁美洲的民主力量支援多米尼加人民争取民主的斗争。

    25日在委内瑞拉还成立了多米尼加共和国解放委员会。这个组织的宗旨是反对还存在于拉丁美洲的独裁统治，首先是帮助多米尼加人获得自由。参加这个委员会的有六百个具有各种不同倾向的各界人士的代表。
