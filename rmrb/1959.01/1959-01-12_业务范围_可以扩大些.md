    “Scope of Business” Can Be Expanded
     CPC Qingshan District Committee, Wuhan City　Hou Yu
    Thanks to a friend, I brought back a large bag of children's酥糖 (sū táng - brittle sugar candy) from Beijing.
    This sugar is good sugar, and everyone who eats it is satisfied. However, after we finished eating the candy and carefully looked at the candy wrapper, wanting to appreciate the child's appearance, we were greatly disappointed. In the middle of the paper is a little girl, no, it should be said a strange-looking human figure. We couldn't figure out what she had on her head, what clothes she was wearing, and she was even wearing high heels... In short, it made people feel very uncomfortable. We couldn't help but complain about the candy factory, why couldn't they ask our artists to design a lively child's image? Children collect these candy wrappers like they are collecting stamps when they eat the candy. They play with them, give them to friends, and learn the pictures on the candy wrappers. But what can such a candy wrapper bring to children!
    Another day, I was working in the Propaganda Department and saw someone come to the comrades in the Propaganda Department, asking him to help persuade an art worker in the Cultural Center to design a 麻烘糕 (má hōng gāo - sesame cake) packaging paper for them. The comrade from the Propaganda Department immediately called the art worker, but the voice from the receiver said: "This is not within our scope of business!" He flatly refused.
    These two things crowded into my mind, which made me understand that it was wrong for us to blame the candy factory at first, and my opinion naturally shifted to our artists. I don't know whether doing this is within the artist's "scope of business," but I think: drawing a grass, a tree, a person, or an animal on the packaging paper of sugar or other pastries is definitely not less meaningful than painting on canvas.

    “业务范围”可以扩大些

    托朋友的福，从北京带回一大包小孩酥糖。
    这糖是好糖，谁吃了都满意。可是，当我们吃完了糖，仔细看看包糖纸，想欣赏一下小孩模样，却大失所望。纸中间画着一个小女孩，不，应该说是一个莫名其妙的人像，我们怎么也猜不透她头上搞了些啥名堂，身上穿的啥衣裳，脚上还穿了一双高跟鞋……总之叫人看了实在不舒服。我们不禁怨起糖厂来了，为什么不能请我们的美术家设计一个生气勃勃的孩子的形象呢？孩子们吃糖时就像在收集邮票一样地收集这些糖纸，他们拿它玩耍，拿它赠友，学那糖纸上的画。可是这样一张糖纸能给孩子们带来什么呢！
    另一天，我在宣传部办事，看见有人来找宣传部的同志，请他帮忙说服文化馆一位美术工作者为他们设计一幅麻烘糕包装纸。宣传部那位同志当即给那位美术工作者打电话，但是话筒里传来的声音是：“这不是我们的业务范围！”一口回绝了。
    这两件事一齐挤在我的脑子里，才使我明白，原来我们起初光责备糖厂是不对的，我的意见也就自然地转嫁给我们的美术家了。干这事到底是不是美术家的“业务范围”我不知道，但我想：在糖或其他糕点包装纸上画上一草一木一人一兽，决不比画在画布上的意义更小些。
