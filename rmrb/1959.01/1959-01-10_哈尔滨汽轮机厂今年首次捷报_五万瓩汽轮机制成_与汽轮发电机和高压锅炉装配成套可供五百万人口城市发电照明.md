Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 9th: China's first high-temperature, high-pressure 50,000 kW steam turbine was successfully trial-produced on January 4th at the Harbin Turbine Plant. After multiple test runs, the quality has proven to be excellent.

The basic construction project of the Harbin Turbine Plant only passed national acceptance and went into production on December 10, 1958. Before this, in accordance with the principle of "building while producing," the plant had already successfully trial-produced two 25,000 kW steam turbines. Subsequently, in just over two months, it manufactured this 50,000 kW steam turbine.

This steam turbine is currently the most powerful steam turbine in China. When assembled with the 50,000 kW steam turbine generator currently under manufacture and the 230-ton high-pressure boiler already produced, it will become a complete set of large-scale thermal power generating equipment. The electricity generated by this set of equipment can supply lighting for a city of five million people.

The 50,000 kW steam turbine has a large capacity, new technology, and a complex structure, while the time required for its manufacture was short, which added many difficulties for the workers and staff of the Harbin Turbine Plant. However, under the leadership of the Party, the workers and staff overcame all difficulties by launching mass movements and carrying out technical revolutions, and greatly shortened the trial production period. When processing the cylinder, technicians and workers devised a method of using two machine tools to process it together, reducing the cylinder processing time by half. Lathe operators Song Wanqing, Gu Hexing, Wan Shunsong, and others, when processing the steam seals, completed eight days of work in just two days and nights because they prepared well in advance and accelerated the cutting speed. The assembly section also improved its working methods, assembling parts as soon as they arrived, which increased the efficiency of the entire assembly work by more than threefold compared to the past. Due to the advance completion of these key tasks, the man-hours spent on trial-producing this steam turbine were much less than the man-hours spent on trial-producing the 25,000 kW steam turbine.

In manufacturing this steam turbine, the plant received strong assistance in materials and technology from brother factories such as the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, the Harbin Boiler Plant, and the Xiangtai Machinery Plant. The Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant freed up the machine tool for processing the 72,500 kW hydro-generator to process the large shaft for the 50,000 kW steam turbine; the workers and staff of the Xiangtai Machinery Plant, through research, overcame the difficulties of insufficient equipment and cast the 18-ton water pump base for this steam turbine.

This is the already manufactured 230-ton high-pressure boiler. Together with the already manufactured 50,000 kW steam turbine and the 50,000 kW steam turbine generator currently under manufacture, it will be assembled into a complete set of large-scale thermal power generating equipment.

### 哈尔滨汽轮机厂今年首次捷报  五万瓩汽轮机制成  与汽轮发电机和高压锅炉装配成套可供五百万人口城市发电照明

    哈尔滨汽轮机厂今年首次捷报
    五万瓩汽轮机制成
    与汽轮发电机和高压锅炉装配成套可供五百万人口城市发电照明
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　我国第一台高温高压五万瓩汽轮机，1月4日在哈尔滨汽轮机厂试制成功。经过多次试车，证明质量良好。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂的基本建设工程是在1958年12月10日才经过国家验收投入生产的。在这以前，这个厂根据边建设边生产的方针，已经试制成功二万五千瓩汽轮机二台，随后在两个多月的时间内，又制造成功了这台五万瓩的汽轮机。
    这台汽轮机是我国目前功率最大的汽轮机，它与正在制造的五万瓩汽轮发电机和已经制成的二百三十吨高压锅炉装配成套，将成为一套大型的火力发电设备。这套设备发出的电，可以供五百万人口的城市照明用。
    五万瓩汽轮机的容量大，技术新，结构复杂，而要求制成的时间又短，这给哈尔滨汽轮机厂的职工增加了不少困难。但是职工们在党的领导下，通过大搞群众运动，大搞技术革命，突破了所有的困难，并且大大缩短了试制期限。在加工汽缸时，技术人员和工人研究出用两台机床一同加工的方法，使汽缸加工时间减少了一半。车工宋万庆、顾和兴、万顺松等在加工汽封时，由于事前作好准备工作，又加快了切削速度，只用两昼夜时间就干完了八昼夜的工作量。装配工段也改进工作方法，部件随到随装，使整个装配工作效率比过去提高三倍以上。由于这些关键工作的提前，试制这台汽轮机所费的工时，比试制二万五千瓩汽轮机所费的工时还少很多。
    这个厂在制造这台汽轮机时，得到了哈尔滨电机厂、哈尔滨锅炉厂、祥泰机械厂等兄弟工厂在材料和技术上的大力帮助。哈尔滨电机厂把加工七万二千五百瓩水轮发电机的机床腾出，为五万瓩汽轮机加工大轴；祥泰机械厂职工经过钻研，克服了设备不足的困难，为这台汽轮机铸出了十八吨重的水泵大底座。（附图片）
    这是已经制成的二百三十吨高压锅炉。它和已经制成的五万瓩汽轮机以及正在制造的五万瓩汽轮发电机，将装配成为一套大型火力发电设备。
