The Pig Doctor's Notes
Hangzhou University Cadre Sent Down for Labor, Jiang Feng

One day, I heard that You Shui's family had lost a pig. This only flitted across my mind: What a pity, why isn't there a veterinarian in the village?

A few days later, I heard that Yongkang's family next door also lost a pig to an epidemic. My heart began to ache, thinking that I had studied animal husbandry in school, which briefly touched on veterinary medicine. But because I wasn't interested, I didn't study it seriously, and after changing to another major in 1945, I had forgotten all about it, not a trace remained. Now, the Party is calling on us to go down to the countryside for labor and to integrate with the workers and peasants. Can I turn a blind eye to the pig epidemic? No! So, I said to myself: If I don't know, I'll learn! On the one hand, I asked someone to buy some pamphlets on animal husbandry and veterinary medicine from the city. On the other hand, I put up a sign: If anyone's pig is sick, I can try to treat it!

The books arrived, and I frantically read them during my rest time. But book after book, I couldn't remember much. Swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine plague, swine paratyphoid, and a whole string of disease names, with symptoms that were ever-changing yet very similar. This was much more difficult than treating people; if it were a person, I could ask where they felt uncomfortable, but pigs can't talk! Some medicines, if given in large doses, could be fatal, and if given in small doses, they wouldn't be effective. Especially traditional Chinese medicine, with tens of thousands of names, its properties, effects, and efficacy, were really hard to remember! I felt frustrated and wavered. Fortunately, I remembered what a leading comrade of the Party said before I went down to the countryside: "After going down, you will inevitably encounter many difficulties. Each difficulty is a test." So I gritted my teeth and started reading again.

Soon after the pig doctor's sign was put up, the owner of a sick pig came to my door. Guo Bin's pig was sick, and he wanted me to take a look at it. I thought to myself: This is the first shot, and I can't afford to miss! But I didn't even know how to load a syringe or how to inject it, what should I do? After thinking it over, there was only one way: put down my airs and learn humbly from the masses! I thought of Yin Chuan, this simple young farmer who had studied in the county for a week, he must know how to give injections. I went to his house to ask for advice and asked him to give the first injection while I assisted him.

The busiest time of the spring plowing season was also when the pig epidemic was most prevalent in the village, with several pigs getting sick every day. And at that time, I was working in the fields all day long, so tired that I just wanted to lie down and rest when I had time, even if it was just for a minute. But with so many sick pigs, could the pig doctor not make house calls? Moreover, I had stipulated that no pig that I had diagnosed could be allowed to die. Therefore, I perked up and carefully attended to each sick pig, like a resident doctor making rounds in a hospital ward, inspecting the pigs three times a day. Before going to work in the morning, I rushed to inspect the "wards" once, then again at noon, and again after dinner, measuring their temperature, taking their pulse, checking their condition, asking about their appetite, and carefully caring for each sick pig.

Gradually, I developed a strong affection for this work. Whenever a sick pig recovered its health, I felt an indescribable joy in my heart. So, even though I was very tired at that time, I persevered.

But once, when I jumped into the pigsty to give an inoculation to Yue Hu's fattening pig, I stepped on the wet, smelly pig manure, and a spurt of pig dung shot into my mouth. Ah, that taste... I really don't know how to describe it. Usually, after examining a sick pig, I would have countless amounts of the pig's manure on my body and hands. Pig manure is particularly stinky, and you can't wash off the smell even after washing three times. But this time, I actually got it in my mouth, it was really disgusting. I got angry and almost didn't want to do it anymore. Finally, I restrained myself again. What kind of labor training would it be if I gave up halfway?

Over the past year, I have gone from not knowing how to do it to knowing how to do it, from wavering to loving this part-time job, and it has been a ideological struggle. Under the guidance of the Party, I won this self-struggle. I have treated five or sixty pigs, as well as a few other poultry and livestock. Except for a constipated pig in Granny Ashou's family, which I was called in to treat too late to be saved, no other sick pig has died. I deeply realized that knowledge comes from practice, and talent comes from the masses. A person's knowledge and talent can only unleash their greatest wisdom and effect if they do not deviate from socialism, the leadership of the Party, and the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Now, when I walk in the village, some farmers always greet me warmly and call out affectionately, "Comrade Jiang!" I couldn't help but remember a quote from Gorky:

"To feel that one is needed by people and close to them – this is the greatest enjoyment and the highest joy in life."

    猪郎中手记
    杭州大学下放干部　蒋风
    有一天，我听说友水家死了一只猪。这在我思想上只是淡淡地掠过一个影子：真可惜，村里怎么没有一个兽医员？
    过了几天，听说友水隔壁的永康家又一只猪感染疫病死了。我的心开始难受起来，想到自己在学校里曾经读过一门畜牧学，那当中也曾约略地谈到兽医的内容，但因为不感兴趣，没有认真学，而且从1945年改学别的专业后，早把它忘得一干二净，一点影子也没有了。现在，党号召我们下放劳动锻炼，要和工农结合，我能眼看猪疫流行不睬吗？不能！于是，我对自己说：不会，就学嘛！我一方面托人到城里买来一些畜牧兽医的小册子，一方面就挂出了招牌：那家有猪生病，我可以试着医医看！
    书买来了，我利用休息时间拼命翻读。可是一本又一本，看来看去，不大记得住。什么猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫、猪副伤寒等等一大串病名，病状千变万化而又极相似。这比给人看病困难得多，要是人，可以问问他那儿不舒服，猪可不会说话呀！有些药，分量重，可以致死，少了又药效不大；特别是中药，成万上千种名称，它的性质、作用、药效，真不好记！我感到伤脑筋了，动摇了。幸而记起下放前一位党的领导同志的话：“下去以后，必然会遇到许多困难。每一个困难，都是一重考验。”我才硬了头皮重新读起来。猪郎中的牌挂出去不久，就有病畜的主人找上门来。国宾家的一只猪病了，要我给它看看。我心想：这是第一炮，可不能不打响！可是我连针药怎么装，怎么注射还不知道，怎么办呢？左思右想，只有一条路：放下架子，虚心向群众学习！我想到了银川这个质朴的青年农民，他曾到县里学习过一个星期，一定会打针。我上他家去求教了一番，并且请他打下第一支针药，我在旁边做助手。
    春耕生产最紧张的时候，正是村里猪疫最盛行的时候，每天都有几个猪害病。而我那时一天到晚摊田，累得休息时候就想躺下来，哪怕只躺一分钟也好。可是，病猪这么多，猪郎中能不出诊吗？而且，我自己曾经规定：每一只经过自己诊断的病猪都不允许出事故。因此，我振作精神，小心翼翼地伺候着每一只病猪，像医院巡查病房的住院医师一样，一天三次巡视各家的病猪。早上出工前，抢着把“病房”巡查一周，中午再看一遍，晚饭后又走一趟，测测体温，搭搭脉搏，看看病况，问问食欲，细心地护理着每一只病猪。
    慢慢地，我对这工作产生了浓厚的感情了。每当一只病猪恢复健康的时候，自己内心有一种说不出的快慰。所以，那时尽管很疲劳，但是坚持下来了。
    可是有一次，我跳进猪圈去，踩在那湿漉漉的稀臭的猪屙垃圾上，冒着一阵阵的臭味去给月虎家的肉猪打防疫针的时候，那猪一挣扎，一撮猪粪恰恰射进我的嘴里。啊呀，那滋味……真不知怎么说才好。往常看完病猪，我身上手上总要沾上无数病猪的粪。病猪的粪本来特别臭，洗上三遍也洗不掉臭味。可是这回竟吃到嘴里了，真恶心死了。我一生气，几乎又不想干了。终于又自己克制住，我若半途而废，算什么下放锻炼呢！
    一年来，我从不会到会，从动摇到热爱这份兼职，是经历了一场思想斗争的。在党的教导下，我在这场自我斗争中取得了胜利。我先后医好了五、六十头猪，以及少数别的禽畜，除了阿寿太婆家的一只害便秘的小猪，因病期拖得过久才来找我，来不及抢救外，没有死过一只病猪。我深切地体会到：知识是从实践中来的，才能是从群众中来的。一个人的知识、才能，只有不离开社会主义，不离开党的领导，不离开为工农兵服务的方向，才有可能发挥出最大的智慧和作用。
    如今，我在村中走路，总有一些农民热忱地跟我招呼，亲切地叫一声：“蒋同志！”我不由得记起了高尔基的一句话：
    “感到自己是人们所需要的和亲近的人——这是生活中最大的享受，最高的喜悦。”
