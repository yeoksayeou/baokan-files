Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 24th: Hebei province has begun large-scale preparations for spring ploughing. Many people's communes are currently combining this with a large-scale manure collection and fertilizer production campaign, actively organizing transportation to deliver manure to the fields, starting early to welcome the first spring ploughing production after communization, and striving to achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Ningjin, Huanghua and twelve other counties are promoting a "four-way combination" method for manure delivery, integrating manure collection and delivery, manpower and animal power, large vehicles and small vehicles, and other production with manure collection and delivery. They are deploying 100,000 laborers daily to deliver manure, powerfully accelerating the progress of manure delivery. In order to speed up manure delivery, Yangliuqing People's Commune in Jinghai County has repaired or retrofitted more than 200 large and small vehicles with bearings, putting them into manure delivery activities. Ziya People's Commune in the same county also built a 3,000-meter-long ice road, using 120 ice sleds to deliver 150,000 catties of manure to the fields per day, more than doubling the efficiency compared to using large vehicles.

The work of manufacturing and repairing production tools is being vigorously carried out. Renqiu and Shulu counties alone have recently manufactured more than 4,000 units of rice transplanters, wheat harvesters, cultivators, etc., and repaired more than 24,000 pieces (units) of power machinery, deep plows, rope-traction plows, double-wheel double-share plows, waterwheels, vehicles, etc., as well as a large number of small farm tools such as hoes, harrows, and seed drills. In Shulu County alone, under the slogan of "everyone participates in preparing for ploughing," more than 3,700 blacksmiths, carpenters, and drivers have participated in the repair of mechanical farm tools, and they aim to complete the repair of all production tools within this month. Chengguan Brigade of Chengguan People's Commune in Huanghua County also inventoried all large and small farm tools.

All localities are also paying attention to storing fodder for spring ploughing and strengthening livestock breeding to ensure the need for animal power during spring ploughing. The province needs a total of 15 billion catties of fodder for livestock, and more than 11.7 billion catties have already been stored. The work of grass cutting and storage is still being intensified. According to statistics from 19 counties and cities, there are currently 240,000 laborers engaged in grass cutting.

All localities also attach great importance to the storage and management of seeds. Gaoyang County, according to the spring ploughing planting plan, has prepared more than 16 million catties of various seeds early on, and has ensured that all seed storage warehouses, sheds, and cellars have achieved good ventilation, and heat preservation. Gaocheng County not only prepared various seeds, but also conducted germination tests on more than 6.5 million catties of cotton seeds, with a germination rate of over 80%. They also conducted scientific identification of more than 28 million catties of grain seeds and peanut seeds, and properly stored them.

In terms of water conservancy work, in addition to completing certain water conservancy projects, some people's communes are also trying every means to find water sources, store water, and cultivate ice to create conditions for expanding irrigation in the spring. Nandaran People's Commune in Tang County organized a water storage team of more than 100 people to divert water to fill reservoirs and store ice. In the previous period, they had diverted more than 590,000 cubic meters of water to fill reservoirs, and are continuing to carry out the work.

    备耕任务大需要及早抓
    河北大规模积肥送肥、检修农具、贮备种子
    新华社天津24日电　河北各地已经开始了大规模的备耕工作。许多人民公社目前正结合大搞积肥造肥运动，积极组织运输力量往地里送粪，提早动手迎接公社化以后的第一次春耕生产，力争今年农业生产实现更大的跃进。
    宁津、黄骅等十二个县，在送粪方面推行了积肥与送粪、人力与畜力、大车与小车，其他生产与积肥送粪的四结合办法，每天投入送粪的劳力达十万人，有力地加速入送粪进度。静海县杨柳青人民公社为了加快送粪，已把二百多部大、小车辆进行检修或改装上轴承，投入了送粪活动。这个县的子牙人民公社，还修了一条三千多公尺长的冰道，使用一百二十辆冰床，一天往地里送粪十五万斤，比用大车送提高效率一倍多。
    制造和检修生产工具的工作，正在大力进行。仅任丘、束鹿两县，最近期间就已制造出插秧机、小麦收割机、中耕器等四千多部，检修了动力机械、深耕犁、绳索牵引犁、双轮双铧犁、水车、车辆等二万四千多件（部），以及耠子、耙、播种耧等大批小农具。其中只束鹿县就在“人人动手备耕”的口号下，有三千七百多个铁木匠和司机手参加了机械农具检修工作，要在本月内完成全部生产工具的检修任务。黄骅县城关人民公社城关大队，还对所有大、小农具进行了清点。
    各地还注意贮备春耕饲草，加强牲畜饲养，保证春耕时的畜力需要。全省牲畜共需饲草一百五十亿斤，已经贮备好了一百十七亿多斤，现在打草、贮草工作，仍在加紧进行。据十九个县、市统计，目前有二十四万个劳力在进行打草工作。
    各地对种子的贮备和保管也很重视。高阳县根据春耕种植计划，及早备妥了一千六百多万斤各种种籽，并使收藏种籽的库、仓、窖，全部达到了排气、通风、保温良好。藁城县不仅备好了各种种籽，还把六百五十多万斤棉籽进行了发芽试验，发芽率达80％以上；对二千八百多万斤粮种和花生种，也进行了科学鉴定，加以妥善保管。
    水利工作方面，除完成一定的水利工程外，有的人民公社还千方百计找寻水源，蓄水养冰，为春季扩大浇地创造条件。唐县南大冉人民公社组织了一个有一百多人参加的蓄水专业队，进行引水灌库，养冰蓄水，前一个时期已引水灌库五十九万多公方，目前还在继续开展中。
