This newspaper's Anshan dispatch, December 31st: On the eve of the New Year, hundreds of thousands of steelworkers in the steel capital of Anshan are welcoming a new and even greater year with pride. They are ready to push production to a new level in the first quarter, laying the foundation for completing the year's leap forward plan.

The workers of No. 10 open-hearth furnace in the Second Steelmaking Plant, who completed the year's leap forward plan 15 days ahead of schedule, have been arriving early for work every day recently, determined to quickly address the shortcomings of the water jacket affecting production, creating conditions for a production leap forward in 1959. In 1958, this open-hearth furnace increased steel production for the country by more than 40,000 tons without adding any equipment. In 1959, they are determined to make an even greater contribution.

The workers of No. 9 blast furnace, which was rated as a Red Flag Furnace, decorated the blast furnace operating room beautifully and hung a huge banner reading "Plant the Red Flag, Surpass Benxi, Strive for First in the Country." After continuous improvement over the past year, this blast furnace produced more than 600 tons of iron per day in December 1958 than at the beginning of the year. The workers said that in 1959, they will strive to catch up with the advanced blast furnace in Benxi and become a national Red Flag Furnace.

The employees of the First Primary Rolling Mill, who achieved remarkable results in launching a mass movement in the second half of 1958, proposed to work hard for 30 days in January 1959 to realize their plan of transforming one plant into two plants in half a year, which they put forward at the end of October 1958, three months ahead of schedule. Workers in rolling, soaking, and maintenance are discussing the national plan for January, which not only increases production by more than 20,000 tons compared to the month with the highest output in 1958, but also increases the variety of products significantly.

This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch, December 31st: Shanghai's machinery and electrical industries are further launching mass movements and engaging in technical revolutions to welcome a year of greater leaps forward.

According to preliminary arrangements, the output in 1959 will be much greater than in 1958, and products will develop towards heavy, advanced precision, and cutting-edge directions. The proportion of heavy products in the machinery industry will have a greater increase.

Thus, Shanghai's electromechanical industry is facing two contradictions in preparing for production in 1959: insufficient raw materials and insufficient equipment capacity. To solve these contradictions, factories have recently presented the tasks and difficulties to the workers and mobilized everyone to come up with solutions. After more than a month of enthusiastic and intense preparation work, as of December 20th, factories in the city's machinery and electrical systems have manufactured 4,000 simple machine tools and indigenous equipment, and are manufacturing and preparing to manufacture another 4,000 to 5,000 units. Many difficulties that were originally considered difficult to solve have been resolved. In terms of solving the problem of raw materials, in addition to cooperating with other regions, employees have provided three ways to solve the problem themselves: first, to vigorously carry out technical revolutions and implement conservation and substitution; second, to vigorously carry out "sideline production" and rely on their own efforts; and third, to utilize native steel. For example, after the employees of the Third Workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory modified the design of a cylindrical grinder that was to be produced in large quantities in 1959, the number of parts per machine was reduced by about half, metal materials were saved by nearly 30%, and processing hours were reduced by 43%, while the performance and structure of the machine tool were completely unaffected. Employees of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory used simple machine tools they manufactured themselves to process precision gauge blocks, which are used as inspection standards for high-end, precision products. The precision reached one seven-hundredth of a strand of hair, and the smoothness reached level 14, surpassing similar products in the United Kingdom and the United States. They are now preparing to build a gauge block workshop to expand production. In addition, more than a dozen machinery manufacturing plants in the city are stepping up experiments on the use of native steel. This alone could unlock tens of thousands of tons of resources in the city.

This newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch, December 31st: Henan Province is actively preparing to welcome an even greater leap forward in steel production in 1959.

Before the New Year, all parts of Henan Province generally carried out rectification and improvement work on small-scale indigenous groups, and summarized the production experience and achievements of the past year. Now the province has 266 small-scale indigenous iron and steel base points, basically realizing the "five fixes" of fixed points, fixed types, fixed groups, fixed personnel, and fixed leadership, as well as the base-building and factory-style production of iron and steel. Iron and steel joint enterprises combining indigenous and foreign methods have been initially formed in Shuiye, Jiaozuo, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Minggang, Xinyang, Kaifeng, Nanyang and other places. The province has built 858 iron-smelting furnaces of 3 cubic meters or more, and 78 steel-smelting furnaces of half a ton or more. In summarizing the achievements of iron and steel production over the past year, Nanyang Prefecture also selected and rewarded more than 22,400 iron and steel production models, inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees.

In order to adapt to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods and the development of small-scale indigenous groups, Henan Province has also strengthened the supporting work of smelting equipment and expanded the production of coke and refractory materials. As of the end of December, the province has completed supporting equipment for 3,713 cubic meters of iron-smelting furnaces, and established three refractory material plants in Jiaozuo, Gongxian, and Shanxian, with an annual output of up to 500,000 tons of refractory materials. The planned output of coke will also be greatly increased compared to 1958.

This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, December 31st: On the eve of the New Year, more than 3.9 million laborers in Hebei Province are participating in wheat field management activities, actively creating conditions for a greater wheat harvest next year. At present, all localities are vigorously engaged in accumulating and producing fertilizer to ensure that wheat seedlings are well-fed and warm, and safely overwinter. The number of people involved in fertilizer accumulation activities in Tianjin Prefecture has increased from 200,000 in the previous period to 400,000. At the same time, all localities have generally organized professional teams for manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers, and launched a mass movement of "every team building a factory and everyone making fertilizer." Ningjin and Wuqing counties alone have established more than 3,400 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants and bacterial fertilizer plants for wheat fields, and have produced 1.3 billion jin of various indigenous chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. As of the 27th, more than 60% of the province's more than 35 million mu of wheat fields have been watered, more than half of the wheat fields have been top-dressed, more than 3.6 million mu have been covered with manure, and more than 5.7 million mu have been irrigated with urine and thin manure. Activities such as harrowing, rolling, and hoeing wheat are also being vigorously carried out. The wheat fields covered with manure in Tianjin Prefecture have been covered with about 6,000 to 10,000 jin of manure per mu, and windbreaks have been set up for 360,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields.

This newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch, December 31st: As the Winter Solstice has just passed, the spring plowing season has arrived in Hainan Island. Millions of commune members have already sown nearly 20 million jin of seeds in the fields that have just been harvested, deeply plowed and improved more than 860,000 mu of land, and carried out large-scale water conservancy construction to welcome a more leap forward spring. Areas with earlier seasons, such as Qionghai County and Wenchang County in the east, and Yulin County in the south, had already begun sowing and raising seedlings at the end of November, and some areas have already transplanted rice seedlings. The western regions with later seasons have also begun sowing successively. The rice seedlings in more than 200,000 mu of seedling fields are growing more vigorously and sturdily than last year.

The average sowing amount per mu of the main field in the island's 107 communes has reached about 80 jin, an increase of one to two times compared to 1958. Most of the grain seeds have been selected and disinfected, and measures such as combined seedling fields, sufficient base fertilizer application, and sparse sowing of seedlings have been adopted to cultivate strong seedlings.

This newspaper's Yakeshi dispatch, December 31st: The vast "sea of forests" of the Greater Khingan Range is covered with a glittering veil of silver. Tens of thousands of employees of Han, Mongolian, Daur, Hui and other ethnic groups have overcome the severe ice and snow and various difficulties. In 1958, they took down a total of 3.2 million cubic meters of timber, exceeding the original national plan by 60%. Most of these timbers have been continuously transported to various places.

In order to comprehensively utilize forest resources and improve timber utilization, in the second half of 1958, forestry employees started from scratch and set up more than 180 forest product industrial factories, using branches, bark, sawdust, etc., which were discarded or used as firewood in the past, to produce fiberboard, Meishi board, wood tar and other more than 20 kinds of products, totaling more than 100 tons.

At present, various forestry enterprises have made preliminary plans and measures for 1959. In the first quarter, we will fight hard in the golden season and take down 2.8 million to 3 million cubic meters of timber. This figure is equivalent to 80% to 90% of the total completed in 1958.

This newspaper's Urumqi dispatch, December 31st: On the vast Tianshan grasslands, hundreds and thousands of Kazakh herdsmen are happily busy in the face of ice and snow, welcoming a new year of great leap forward.

For thousands of years, sheep in the pastoral areas here have been produced once a year, and the lambing work has been concentrated in April each year. This year, in order to develop animal husbandry at high speed, it is required to produce three litters in two years and densely reproduce. 11,000 of the 13,000 eligible ewes in the entire region participated in the two-year, three-litter mating. Now, more than four months have passed since mating, and Kazakh herdsmen are preparing to produce these more than 10,000 lambs.

According to the results of large livestock reaching full mating and full pregnancy (90%) and intensive breeding of sheep with three litters in two years, in 1959, the herdsmen here plan to increase the net livestock growth rate from about 10% in the past to more than 42%. While developing animal husbandry and agriculture, they also plan to expand milk powder processing plants and establish flour mills, livestock product processing plants and other industries.

This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, December 31st: More than 100,000 fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands, who catch hairtail in the Shengshan Fishing Ground, launched a fishing production assault week before the New Year, welcoming the new year with outstanding production results. At present, Zhoushan fishermen have caught 1.05 million dan of hairtail, exceeding the output of the entire winter fishing season in 1957; the total fishery output in 1958 will also be about two and a half times higher than in 1957.

During this fishing assault week, the fishermen also tried every means to do a good job in handling fish products. While vigorously grasping production, party organizations at all levels in the Zhoushan fishing area also vigorously grasped life. A large number of pork, vegetables, old wine, fruits, candies, cigarettes and various New Year goods were continuously transported to the fishing grounds.

The Zhoushan Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has formulated a general plan for fishery production in 1959, determining to vigorously grasp fishing, vigorously grasp aquaculture, vigorously grasp the comprehensive utilization of aquatic products, and double the total fishery output compared to 1958.

    奋发向前跨上更大跃进的一年
    英雄人民投入新的战斗
    从大兴安岭到海南岛，从天山草原到东海边，到处一片新气象
    本报鞍山31日电　新年前夕，钢都鞍山十几万名钢铁战士怀着自豪的心情，迎接新的更伟大的一年。他们已准备好在第一季度里就把生产推向一个新的水平，为完成全年跃进计划打下基础。
    提前十五天完成全年跃进计划的第二炼钢厂十号平炉的工人们，最近几天每天都提前上班，决定短期内就处理好水套过体影响生产的缺点，给1959年的生产跃进创造条件。1958年这个平炉在没有增添任何设备的情况下，为国家增产了四万多吨钢，1959年他们决心做出更大的贡献。
    被评为红旗炉的九号高炉的工人们，把高炉操作室打扮得漂漂亮亮，挂上了“插红旗、超本溪、力争全国第一”的巨幅标语。经过一年来的不断改进，这座高炉1958年12月份每天比年初多生产六百多吨铁；工人们表示，1959年他们要争取赶上本溪的先进高炉，成为全国的红旗炉。
    在1958年下半年大搞群众运动取得了显著成就的第一初轧厂职工，提出要在1959年1月份大干三十天，提前三个月实现他们在1958年10月底提出的苦干半年、一厂变两厂的计划；轧钢、均热、检修等工人正在讨论1月份的国家计划，这个计划不仅比1958年产量最高的月份又增加了两万多吨，而且品种也增加了很多。
    本报上海31日电　上海机械、电机工业进一步大搞群众运动大闹技术革命，迎接更大跃进的一年。
    根据初步安排，1959年产量比1958年大得多，产品要向重型、高级精密、尖端方向发展，机械工业中重型产品的比重将有更大的增长。
    这样，上海机电工业在准备1959年的生产中，首先就面临原材料不足和设备能力不足的两个矛盾。为解决这些矛盾，各厂最近都把任务和困难向职工群众摊牌、交底，发动大家群策群力来解决。经过一个多月的热烈、紧张的备战工作，截至12月20日止，全市机械、电机系统的工厂已制造出四千台简易机床和土设备，正在制造和准备制造的还有四、五千台。很多原来认为难以解决的困难都解决了。各厂在解决原材料方面，除同外地协作以外，职工们提供了三条自我解决的出路：一是大搞技术革命，实行节约代用；二是大搞“副业生产”，自力更生；三是利用土钢。如上海机床厂第三车间职工将1959年准备大量生产的一种外圆磨床修改设计以后，每台零件减少半数左右，金属材料节省近30％，加工工时省43％，而机床的性能和结构完全不受影响。上海机床厂职工用自己制造的简易机床，加工出作为高级、精密产品检验标准的精密量块，精度达到一根头发丝的七百分之一，光洁度达到十四级，超过英美国家的同类产品。现在他们正在筹建一个量块车间，准备扩大生产。此外，全市有十多家机械制造厂正在加紧试验利用土钢。单是这一点，全市就有好几万吨资源可以发掘出来。
    本报郑州31日电　河南省为迎接1959年钢铁生产的更大跃进而积极进行准备。
    年前，河南省各地对小土群普遍进行了整顿和提高的工作，并总结一年来的生产经验和成就。现在全省已有小土群钢铁基点二百六十六处，基本上实现了定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导的“五定”和钢铁基地化、生产工厂化。水冶、焦作、洛阳、郑州、明港、信阳、开封、南阳等地已初步形成了土洋结合的钢铁联合企业。全省已建成三立方公尺以上的炼铁炉八百五十八座，半吨以上的炼钢炉七十八座。南阳专区在总结一年来钢铁生产成就当中，还评选出二万二千四百多名钢铁生产模范，并给予奖励，鼓舞广大职工的干劲。
    为了适应土洋并举和小土群的发展，河南省还加强了冶炼设备的配套工作，并且扩大了焦炭、耐火材料的生产。到12月底为止，全省配套设备已完成了三千七百一十三立方公尺的炼铁炉，并在焦作、巩县、陕县建立了三个耐火材料厂，年产耐火材料可达五十万吨。焦炭计划产量也将比1958年大大增加。
    本报天津31日电　新年前夕，河北省有三百九十多万个劳力参加麦田管理活动，积极为明年小麦更大丰收创造条件。目前各地正在大搞积肥造肥活动，要使麦苗吃饱盖暖，安全过冬。天津专区投入积肥活动的人数已由前一时期二十万人增到了四十万人。同时各地一般都组织了制造土化肥专业队，开展了“队队建厂人人造肥”的群众运动。只宁晋、武清两县即为麦田建立了三千四百多个土化肥厂和菌肥厂，已生产多种土化肥和菌肥十三亿斤。到27日止，全省三千五百多万亩麦田，60％以上已进行了浇水，半数以上的麦田已进行了追肥，已经盖粪的有三百六十多万亩，浇尿灌稀的有五百七十多万亩。耙、轧、锄麦等活动也在大力进行。天津专区已盖粪的麦田，每亩盖粪六千斤到万斤左右，并为三十六万亩高额丰产麦田夹起了风障。
    本报广州31日电　冬至刚刚过去，春耕的季节已经降临到海南岛。成百万公社社员已经在刚收获不久的田野播下近两千万斤种籽，深翻改土八十六万多亩，进行大规模兴修水利，以迎接一个更为跃进的春天。东部的琼海县、文昌县，南部的榆林县等季节较早的地区，早在11月底已经开始播种育秧，个别地区已经插秧。季节较迟的西部地区也陆续开始播种。二十几万亩秧田的稻秧长得比去年旺盛茁壮。
    全岛一百零七个公社每亩本田的播种数量平均达八十斤左右，比1958年增加一至两倍。谷种绝大部分进行了选种、种子消毒，并且采用合式秧田、施足基肥、秧苗疏播等措施来培育壮秧。
    本报牙克石31日电　大兴安岭千里“林海”带着银光闪闪的纱罩。数万名汉、蒙古、达斡尔、回等族职工，战胜了冰雪严寒和各种困难，1958年共拿下木材三百二十万立方公尺，超过原订国家计划60％，这些木材大部分已源源运往各地。
    为了综合利用森林资源，提高木材利用率。1958年下半年，林区职工白手起家办了一百八十多个林产工业工厂，利用过去被抛弃或作烧柴用的枝桠、树皮、锯末等生产出纤维板，美石板、木焦油等二十多种产品，共达一百多吨。
    目前各林业企业已作了1959年的初步规划和措施。第一季度要大战黄金季节，拿下木材二百八十到三百万立方公尺。这个数字相当于1958年全年完成数的80％到90％。
    本报乌鲁木齐31日电　千里辽阔的天山草原成百成千的哈萨克牧民，正在冒着冰雪严寒，为迎接新的大跃进的一年欢乐地忙碌着。
    千百年来，这里的牧业地区绵羊都是一年一产，接羔工作都是集中在每年4月间，今年，为了高速度发展畜牧业，要求两年三产，密集繁殖。全区一万三千只适龄母羊就有一万一千只参加了两年三胎配种。现在，配种四个多月已经过去了，哈萨克牧民已在准备接产这一万多只羔羊。
    根据大畜已经达到了全配全怀（90％）和绵羊两年三胎密集繁殖的结果，1959年，这里的牧民打算把牲畜净增率从过去的10％左右提高到42％以上。在发展牧业、农业的同时，还打算扩大奶粉加工厂，建立面粉厂、畜产品加工厂等工业。
    本报杭州31日电　在嵊山渔场捕带鱼的舟山群岛十万多渔民，新年前开展了一次渔业生产突击周运动，用出色的生产成绩迎接新的一年。目前舟山渔民已捕带鱼一百零五万担，超过了1957年整个冬汛的产量；1958年渔业总产量也将比1957年翻两番半左右。
    在这次捕鱼突击周中，渔民们还千方百计做好鱼货处理工作。舟山渔区各级党组织在大抓生产的同时，也大抓生活，大批的猪肉、蔬菜、老酒、水果、糖果、香烟和各种年货，源源运往渔场。
    中共舟山地委已经制订了1959年渔业生产的大体规划，确定大抓捕捞，大抓养殖，大抓水产综合利用，渔业总产量比1958年翻一番。
