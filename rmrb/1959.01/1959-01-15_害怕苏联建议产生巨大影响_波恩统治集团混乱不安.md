Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 14th - The Adenauer ruling group has been tense and chaotic in the last two days in the face of the new Soviet proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

They have to deal with growing internal divisions, and at the same time are worried that the "Allies", especially the United States, will disagree with West Germany on how to deal with the Soviet proposals.

On the 12th and 13th, the CDU-CSU parliamentary group council held continuous tense meetings to discuss the situation caused by the new Soviet proposals. Adenauer gave successive talks, trying to suppress the dissenting opinions of the opposition party and his own party.

The Free Democratic Party parliamentary group spent the whole day of the 13th discussing the new Soviet proposals. Before this, the party had requested a parliamentary foreign policy debate, and it is still uncertain whether it intends to abandon this request.

The Social Democratic Party Presidium also held a meeting on the 13th, chaired by Ollenhauer. This party demanded immediate negotiations on the issues raised in the Soviet note.

Currently, the debate in Bonn political circles focuses on whether to strive for the discussion of the German peace treaty by the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Some opposition parties hope to hold such negotiations, but Adenauer said that "the proposal on the peace treaty is tactically harmful under any circumstances."

The situation shows that disagreements not only exist between the parties, but also within Adenauer's own government and party, where disagreements are clearly growing. At his party's parliamentary group meeting, Adenauer shouted, "There is nothing that could better serve the Soviet Union than for us to show very bad confusion, unease, loss of confidence and trust in ourselves, and to make inconsiderate and unstudied proposals now." He said this warning "applies to members of the Federal Government and to all members of the parliamentary groups."

    害怕苏联建议产生巨大影响
    波恩统治集团混乱不安
    新华社波恩14日电　在苏联提出的关于缔结对德和约的新建议面前，阿登纳统治集团最近两天陷于紧张和混乱不安。
    他们既要对付日益增长的内部意见分歧，同时又担心“盟国”、特别是美国在如何对付苏联建议方面同西德出现不一致。
    12日和13日两天，基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟议会党团理事会连续紧张地举行会议讨论因苏联新建议而引起的局势问题。阿登纳接连发表谈话，力图把反对党以及他自己党内的分歧意见压下去。
    自由民主党议会党团在13日整天都在讨论苏联新建议问题。在这以前这个党曾经提出举行议会外交辩论的要求，现在还不能肯定它是否打算放弃这种要求。
    社会民主党主席团也在13日在奥伦豪尔主持下举行了会议，这个党要求马上就苏联照会中提出的问题举行谈判。
    目前波恩政界中的争论集中在是否要争取由苏美英法四国来讨论对德和约的问题上。一些反对派希望举行这种谈判，而阿登纳却表示“关于和约的建议在任何情况下在战术上都是有害的”。
    情况表明，意见分歧不仅存在于各党派之间，就在阿登纳自己的政府和党内意见分歧也显然在增长。阿登纳在他的党的议会党团会议上叫喊说，“没有比我们现在表现出很不好的混乱、不安，丧失对自己的信心和信赖，以及作出不加考虑和未经仔细研究的建议来，能够更好地为苏联服务的了”。他说，这个警告“适用于联邦政府成员，也适用所有各议会党团的成员”。
