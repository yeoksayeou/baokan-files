Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, 4th: A conference was held in Minsk on the 3rd by the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Communist Party of Byelorussia.

K.T. Mazurov, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, delivered a report at the meeting.

N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting. He also awarded the Order of Lenin to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, commending it for the successful restoration of the national economy destroyed during the war and the great achievements of the Byelorussian people in the further development of industry, construction, agriculture and culture. This is the second time that the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic has been awarded the Order of Lenin.

In his report, Mazurov said that the facts of the past year convincingly demonstrate the correctness of the historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This Congress guaranteed the Soviet state's development along the path of communist construction, following Lenin's line.

Mazurov said that now, every citizen of the Soviet Union understands how far the factionalists Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov were divorced from life and the people, and how they attempted to lead the party away from the course charted by the 20th Congress of the CPSU on major issues of domestic and foreign policy. Every citizen of the Soviet Union also clearly understands how correct the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee were in resolutely rebuffing this anti-Party group with the support of the entire nation.

Mazurov then spoke about the achievements of the Byelorussian national economy. He said that Byelorussia now produces 12% of the Soviet Union's total output of tractors and 11% of its metal-cutting machine tools. The number of metal-cutting machine tools per capita in the republic is approximately the same as in the United States and the United Kingdom, and much higher than in France and Japan. In terms of output per capita, the production of trucks is higher than in Italy, the production of tractors is higher than in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, and the production of motorcycles is higher than in the United Kingdom and West Germany. The republic exports its products to more than 20 countries around the world.

Today, V.I. Kozlov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Byelorussia, published an article in the "Soviet Byelorussia" newspaper to celebrate this holiday. He said: The republic's total industrial output in 1958 increased by more than two times compared to the level of 1940, and by twenty-six times compared to the level of 1913.

Kozlov also said that in recent years, the republic's agriculture has also developed rapidly. In terms of average milk production per capita, it already surpassed the United States in 1958. At present, the republic's average per capita production of milk and butter has exceeded that of the United Kingdom and Italy.

    白俄罗斯共和国和共产党成立四十年
    明斯克举行庆祝大会
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社明斯克讯：白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国最高苏维埃和共和国共产党中央委员会3日在明斯克举行大会，庆祝白俄罗斯共和国和白俄罗斯共产党成立四十周年。
    苏联共产党中央主席团候补委员、白俄罗斯共产党中央第一书记基·特·马祖罗夫在会上作了报告。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在会上讲了话。他还把一枚列宁勋章授予白俄罗斯共和国，表彰它胜利地恢复了在战争期间遭到破坏的国民经济和白俄罗斯人民在进一步发展工业、建筑业、农业和文化方面所取得的巨大成就。这是白俄罗斯共和国第二次荣获列宁勋章。
    马祖罗夫在报告中说，过去一年的事实令人信服地表明了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议的正确性。这次大会保证苏维埃国家沿着共产主义建设道路发展的列宁的方针。
    马祖罗夫说，现在，苏联每一个公民都很了解，宗派分子马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫脱离生活和人民多么远，他们企图使党离开苏共第二十次代表大会对国内政策和外交政策重大问题所规定的路线。苏联每一个公民还清楚地了解到苏联共产党及其中央委员会是多么正确，它们在全国人民的支持下，给予这个反党集团以坚决的反击。
    马祖罗夫接着谈到白俄罗斯国民经济发展的成就。他说，白俄罗斯现在所生产的拖拉机占全苏联生产量的12％，金属切削机床占11％。按人口平均计算，共和国所拥有的金属切削机床的数量大约同美国和英国相等，比法国和日本要多得多。在按人口计算的产量方面，载重汽车要比意大利多，拖拉机要比美国、英国和法国多，机器脚踏车要比英国和西德多。共和国向世界二十多个国家输出自己的产品。
    今天，白俄罗斯最高苏维埃主席团主席瓦·伊·科兹洛夫在“苏维埃白俄罗斯报”上发表文章庆祝这个节日。他说：共和国在1958年的工业总产值比1940年的水平增加两倍多，比1913年的水平增加二十六倍。
    科兹洛夫还说，近几年来，共和国的农业也获得了迅速的发展。在按人口平均计算的牛奶产量方面，它早在1958年就超过了美国。目前共和国在按人口平均计算的产量方面，牛奶和牛油已经超过英国和意大利。
