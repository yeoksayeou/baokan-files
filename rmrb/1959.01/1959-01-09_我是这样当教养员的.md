    This is how I work as a childcare worker
    Yang Chunxia, Zhangqiang Township Branch, Kangping People's Commune, Liaoning

    I am a childcare worker at the Yaogou Production Team Kindergarten in the Dongshan Office of the Zhangqiang Township Branch in Kangping County, Liaoning Province. Let me talk about my experience as a childcare worker. In the early days of establishing the kindergarten, the masses had various opinions. Mothers were always reluctant to part with their children, and the elderly didn't trust young childcare workers, thinking I didn't have experience in taking care of children. They were afraid that the children wouldn't get along, that their own children would be taken advantage of because they were honest, and that they wouldn't get enough to eat, would sleep on cold beds, and would wet the bed at night. Because parents had concerns and children didn't have the habit of collective life, some would come while others wouldn't, and some would sneak back home after arriving. There was no other way, so I went door-to-door to pick them up. Li Fa's family had two children. Every time I went to pick them up, the children would run away out the north window. I went eight times a day and finally managed to bring the children. But the children cried as soon as they arrived at the kindergarten and tried to run home when I wasn't looking. Later, when I asked one of the children, I found out that his mother wouldn't let him come. This gave me a great insight. It wasn't that the children didn't want to come, but that the mothers had concerns. After that, whenever I had time, I went to her house to persuade her, but the child still ran around the streets, wouldn't listen to what I said, and wouldn't come back when I called him. I was so anxious that my voice became hoarse, and I couldn't think of a good solution. The masses were gossiping about all sorts of things. I thought to myself: It would be easier to go to the mountains to work. All day long, I'm either dealing with poop or pee, and I still have to listen to gossip.

    Just then, the township government held a meeting on how to do a good job as a childcare worker, which greatly educated me. It made me clearly realize that my work was glorious, that cultivating the second generation was directly cultivating successors for socialism, and that being a childcare worker could liberate mothers to participate in production. This made me feel that my responsibility was great and increased my determination to overcome difficulties.

    When children return home from kindergarten, mothers always ask them a lot of questions: "Did your 'old aunt' (the children all call me 'old aunt') scold you?" "Did anyone bully you?" etc. Some parents are afraid that their children won't get enough to eat at the kindergarten, so they give them this and that from time to time, and they are even more reluctant to let their children return to the kindergarten in the evening. After I discovered this, I took the time to visit the parents at their homes, solicit their opinions, understand their concerns, patiently explain to them the benefits of children being in kindergarten, and also expressed my determination to take good care of the children.

    When children play, they always stick with the children they get along with. Dancing and the yangko dance are always done in groups. When playing "drop the handkerchief" in a circle outside, they always drop it to the children they like. From this, I realized that just as adults have good friends they are fond of, children also have their own favorite friends. Therefore, when a child doesn't come, I ask their friends to look for them. Li Suzhi and Xiu Yazhi are usually the best of friends and always play together. Once, Xiu Yazhi went visiting relatives and didn't come back. I asked Li Suzhi to find her, and she came back in no time. There is also a parent named Li Fa, who is over forty years old and has two children. The older girl is in kindergarten, but the four-year-old boy refuses to come no matter what the family says. Later, I asked the older child to go home and persuade her little brother. At first, the family wouldn't let him come, but later the older child would tell her mother as soon as she got home, "Kindergarten is so much fun! My old aunt washes my face, combs my hair, and puts rouge on me in the morning. After eating, she teaches us to sing, dance, and act in plays. Tell my little brother to come too." After a few times, she brought her little brother along.

    After the children entered the kindergarten, I noticed that they were not as lively and playful as they were with their own mothers. They were always distant from me, afraid to ask for anything to play with, and would look at me before taking any toys. They would stand in front of the thermos without saying a word when they wanted to drink water. At that time, I wondered why the children weren't like they were with their own mothers when they were with me. Later I thought, "It's because I don't care for the children as much as their own mothers do, I'm not attentive enough to them, and I don't take good enough care of them." After that, I paid extra attention to every move of the children. When I saw them often going to the thermos, I would take the initiative to pour water for them. When they were playing, I would first hand the toys to the children, and I would take even better care of the honest children. Every morning, I used hot water to wash their faces and comb their hair. I found some colorful cloth strips at home and tied bows on the girls' heads and small red tassels on the boys' heads. The children jumped up and down with joy when they looked in the mirror. When eating, I would first serve the children food and tell them to be disciplined, to take as much as they could eat, and not to leave leftovers in their bowls. When the children wanted to poop or pee, I would untie their belts and wipe their bottoms. There was a child named Li Changfa who always wet the bed at night at home. After coming to kindergarten, I paid special attention to this child. Before going to bed, I would first ask him to go outside to pee. When I saw him moving around in the middle of the night, I knew he had to pee, so I woke him up again. After practicing this a few times, he knew to get up and pee himself at night and never wet the bed again.

    The characteristic of children is that they are most willing to learn from adults. Whatever adults do, they do. In order to make the children have fun, I taught them to sing, act in plays, do the yangko dance, and tell fast-paced stories, etc. At first, I was also a little concerned about my image and didn't want to sing loudly, so the children didn't want to sing loudly either. I was even more shy and hesitant when dancing and doing the yangko dance. When the children saw me like this, they were not very generous either. Later, I felt that the children were learning from me, so I danced with the children generously and taught them how to make expressions at the same time. Whatever I did, they did. Now they have learned more than twenty songs, and the children know several sets of yangko dance, fast-paced stories, and plays, and they play different things every day. At first, the children ran into the house when they saw strangers. Later, I set an example for the children in this regard. When parents and guests came, I warmly received them and asked the children to greet the guests. Now the children greet their parents when they see them and are very polite.

    The children became familiar with me and treated me like their own mothers. The parents also reflected that the children had improved at the kindergarten and were more kind than they were at home. One day, I met Xiu Yazhi's and Hu Malin's mothers on the road. I asked them if they still missed their children. Xiu Yazhi's mother said, "The child doesn't miss home at all now. Sometimes, she can't be kept at home even if you try. It's better when she's not at home, which saves me a lot of trouble." Aunt Hu said, "I'm also worried when the child is at home. In the past, when I went out to work, there was no one to look after her at home, so I took her up the mountain. The child either cried or shouted, couldn't eat at the right time, and couldn't sleep at the right time. Now I can rest assured. She eats her fill every day, doesn't go hungry, doesn't get cold, and someone takes care of her. She's dressed up like a flower every day." Now everyone looks at me as if they're seeing a relative they haven't seen for many years, which makes me feel more and more that my work is so glorious.

    我是这样当教养员的
    辽宁康平人民公社张强镇分社　杨春霞
    我是辽宁省康平县张强镇分社东山办事处腰沟生产队幼儿园的教养员。我讲讲我当教养员的经过。在幼儿园建立的初期，群众的认识是各种各样的，孩子妈妈对孩子总是恋恋不舍，老年人对年轻教养员也信不着，认为我没有带孩子经验。他们怕孩子到一起不合群，怕自己孩子老实受屈，又怕吃不饱，睡凉炕、夜间尿炕。因为家长有顾虑，孩子没有集体生活习惯，总是你来他不来的，有的来了还偷着跑回去。没办法，我就登门到户按家去接。李发家有两个孩子，我一去接，孩子顺北窗就跑了，我一天去过八趟，费很大劲才把孩子领来了。但孩子到幼儿园就哭，趁我看不见就往家跑。后来我一问那孩子，才知道是他妈不让来。这给我很大启示，不是孩子不来，是妈妈有顾虑。以后，我一有工夫就去她家，给她打通思想，可是孩子还是满街跑，说也不听，叫也叫不回来，把我嗓子都急哑了，也想不出个好办法来。群众闲言乱语说啥的都有。我就想：真不如上山去干活省心，整天和孩子在一起，不是把屎，就是把尿，还得听闲话。
    正在这时，乡政府召开了怎样作好教养员工作的会议，给我很大教育，使我清楚地认识了自己工作是光荣的，培养第二代是直接为社会主义培养接班人，做教养员，就能把孩子妈妈解放出来参加生产，使我感到自己的责任重大，增加了我克服困难的决心。
    孩子从幼儿园回到家，妈妈们总是好问长问短的：“你老婶（孩子都称呼我为老婶）说你没有？”“别人‘招’你没有？”等等。有的家长怕孩子在幼儿园吃不到啥，一会给点这个，一会给点那个，到晚间就更不愿意叫孩子回来啦。我发觉后，就抽出时间去孩子家里拜访家长，征求他们的意见，了解他们的顾虑，耐心地给他们讲孩子在幼儿园的好处，还向她们表示一定把孩子照顾好。
    孩子玩的时候，总是和合得来的孩子在一起。跳舞、扭秧歌总是一伙。在外边围一圈做丢花手帕玩，也是先丢给投心对意的孩子。从这我就联想到：大人有投心对意的好朋友，小孩子也有自己投心对意的小朋友。因此，孩子有不来时，我就让孩子的小朋友去找。李素芝和修雅芝两个孩子平时最好，一天总是在一起玩，有一次修雅芝串门去了，回来也没有来，我就叫李素芝去会她，不一会儿就会来啦。还有一个叫李发的家长，今年四十多岁，有两个孩子，大女孩在幼儿园，四岁的小男孩家里说啥也不叫来，以后我就叫那个大孩子回家会小弟弟，最初家里不让来，以后大孩子一回家就告诉她妈妈：“幼儿园可好啦，我老婶早晨起来给我洗脸、梳头、擦红，吃完饭还教唱歌、跳舞、演剧，叫我小弟弟也去吧。”几回就把小弟弟也领来了。
    孩子入园后，我就发觉孩子们都不像在自己妈妈跟前那样活泼、爱玩，和我总是疏远，要啥玩艺也不敢说，拿啥玩具也先瞅瞅我，想要喝水站在暖壶跟前不动，也不吱声。当时我就琢磨，为啥孩子在我跟前不像在自己妈妈跟前那样呢？后来我想：“是我对孩子不像自己妈妈那样关心，对孩子体贴不够，照顾的不到。”以后我对孩子的一举一动都格外留心，看他们老往暖壶跟前去，就主动的给孩子倒水，玩时先把玩具送到孩子的手里，对老实孩子就更加照顾。每天早晨用热水给孩子洗脸、梳头。我在家找了一些花布条，给女孩子在头上扎个蝴蝶，男孩子扎个小红缨，孩子照镜子一看乐的都直跳脚。吃饭时先把饭菜给孩子盛好，告诉他们守纪律，吃多少盛多少，不要剩饭碗子。孩子要拉屎、撒尿时，我就给解裤带、擦屁股。有个叫李长发的孩子，平时在家夜间总是尿炕，来幼儿园后，我就对这个孩子特别注意，睡觉前先叫他到外边尿尿，睡到半夜我看他老动弹，知道他有尿，又把他叫起来。这样练习几回，以后夜间有尿他就知道起来自己尿，再也不尿炕了。
    孩子的特点就是最愿意学习大人，大人做啥他就做啥。为了使孩子们玩得高兴，我就教给他们唱歌、演剧、扭秧歌、说快板等等。起初我也有些爱面子，不愿意大声唱，孩子也就不愿意大声唱。跳舞、扭秧歌自己更是羞羞答答，扭扭捏捏的，孩子看我这样，也就不大方了。以后我觉得孩子们在学我呢，我就大大方方的和孩子们一起扭，同时教给他们做表情，我怎样做，他们就怎样做。现在已学会了二十多个歌，秧歌、快板、演剧孩子们都会好几套，一天玩的不重样。最初孩子们看到生人就往屋里跑，以后我在这方面就给孩子做样子，有家长和客人来时，我就热情地接待，同时叫孩子给客人问好。现在孩子见着家长就问好，都很有礼貌。
    孩子和我混熟了，都对我像自己妈妈那样，家长们也反映孩子在幼儿园有出息了，比在家仁义了。有一天我在道上遇见修雅芝和胡玛蔺的妈妈，我问他们还惦念孩子不？修雅芝的妈妈说：“孩子现在一点也不恋家了，有时回家留也留不住，不在家更好，我可省心了。”胡大娘说：“孩子在家我也担心，过去我出去干活，家里没人看她，我就把她领山上去，孩子不是哭就是喊，吃吃不到应时，睡睡不到应时。这回我可放心啦，一天吃的饱饱的，饿不着，冻不着的，有人给看着，一天打扮得像朵花似的。”现在大家看我就像看见多少年没见面的亲人似的，使我越来越感到我的工作太光荣了。
