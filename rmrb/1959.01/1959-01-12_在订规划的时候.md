　　When making plans…

　　1959 is a year to strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Now, many people's communes are, with soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, formulating magnificent plans for a comprehensive leap forward in 1959, proposing various advanced production targets.

　　How to turn advanced targets into reality? This question must be considered when formulating production plans. The news report published in this newspaper today – "How to Achieve High Yield Targets" – provides experience in this regard.

　　The main experience of Changshu County is: revolutionary targets must have revolutionary measures, and revolutionary measures should not only be technical measures, but also include detailed organizational work and concrete measures of strong political and ideological work.

　　This is a very important experience. Production is done by people; only by doing a good job of people's work and mobilizing the masses can all technical measures be implemented and the realization of advanced targets be guaranteed.

    在订规划的时候……
    一九五九年是争取更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年。现在许多人民公社正在以冲天的干劲和实事求是的精神，制订一九五九年全面跃进的宏伟规划，提出各项先进的生产指标。
    怎样使先进指标变为现实？在制订生产规划的时候，都要考虑这个问题。今天本报发表的通讯——“怎样实现高产指标”，在这方面提供了经验。
    常熟县的主要经验是：革命的指标必须有革命的措施，而革命的措施不仅仅是技术上的措施，还应该包括周密的组织工作和强有力的政治思想工作的具体措施。
    这是一条十分重要的经验。生产是靠人来做的，只有做好人的工作，把群众发动起来，才能贯彻一切技术措施，保证先进指标的实现。
