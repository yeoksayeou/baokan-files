Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, January 27th: The leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy stationed in Lushunkou recently issued a circular commending the entire crew of a certain escort vessel for their heroic actions in rescuing fishermen in the face of heavy snow and Force 8 gales.

On the afternoon of December 30th last year, there was a Force 8 gale and heavy snow at sea. Sailing under such weather conditions was very dangerous for an escort vessel. However, to rescue the lives of fishermen, the entire crew of the vessel sailed into the sea without hesitation. During the voyage, large waves crashed from the bow to the stern, and the clothes of every crew member were soaked, with ice forming on their hands and faces. However, everyone stood steadfastly at their posts. During the process of rescuing the fishermen, all the comrades on the vessel were very brave. Engine mechanic Yu Ende was swept into the sea by a wave while trying to save a fisherman's sampan. Engine squad leader Miao Huaxiang and three other comrades immediately rescued him, bringing Yu Ende out of danger. After two and a half hours of fighting, they rescued nine fishermen who had been blown out to sea by the wind and returned safely.

    冒大风雪抢救九个渔民出险
    某护卫艇全体人员受表扬
    新华社旅大27日电　中国人民解放军海军驻旅顺口部队领导机关，最近发出通报，表扬某护卫艇的全体人员，冒着大雪和八级大风抢救渔民的英勇事迹。
    去年12月30日下午，海上刮着八级风，下着大雪。在这样的气象条件下航行，对一只护卫艇来说是很危险的。但艇上的全体水兵为了抢救渔民的生命，毫不犹豫地驶向大海。航行中，大浪从艇头打到艇尾，每个艇员的衣服都被打湿了，手上、脸上都结了冰，但人人都坚毅地站在自己的岗位上。在抢救渔民的过程中，全艇同志都非常勇敢，轮机兵于恩德为了抢救渔民的舢舨，被浪卷进大海，轮机班长苗华祥等三同志，立即进行抢救，使于恩德脱了险。经过两个半小时的搏斗，他们将被大风刮到海上去的九个渔民救回，自己安全返航。
