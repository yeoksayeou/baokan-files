Old Lu Tou
Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Wen Zhizhong

Last winter, I was sent to a construction site for physical labor training. The dozen or so brick and wood bungalows at this site had already been built, and what remained was the interior plastering. Winter construction in the north requires heating. Each room had one or two coal stoves constantly burning, otherwise, the plaster either couldn't be applied, or would crack after application. Not long after we arrived at the site, the leadership decided to have us all tend the stoves for a period. It was here that I met Old Lu Tou.

Stoking the stoves was done in three shifts. When we took over the first day, the previous shift told us, "That old man who distributes coal is really something!" I thought to myself: So what if he's something? He can't not give us coal.

Around two in the afternoon, a young voice shouted outside: "Go to the east end coal yard to collect coal!" By the time I swayed over there with my dirt basket, quite a few people were already lined up. An old man, with his cotton railway worker's uniform open, was struggling to shovel coal, distributing it to everyone. The wind in the frontier was really piercing. Little Yang in front of me kept stomping his feet. It was almost Little Yang's turn, but the old man seemed to be shoveling even slower. Little Yang muttered, "Hurry up and load it!"

The shovel stopped. Old Lu Tou's squinting eyes suddenly shone brightly, slowly looking Little Yang up and down. I sensed something was amiss.

"What's wrong? Feeling cold standing there? Try doing it yourself."

Little Yang blushed and took the shovel. Fine coal dust and larger chunks of coal were mixed together, making it difficult to get the shovel in. Little Yang struggled, but couldn't shovel up much. Some people in line were chuckling softly. I was anxious for Little Yang: "Who told you to be so talkative?" Old Lu Tou, with one hand propped on his lower back and the other using his hat to fan himself, had a shiny, bald head, steaming with heat.

"Young man! Shovel close to the ground," he enthusiastically guided Little Yang.

A few days later, a quarrel erupted next to the wire fence of the coal yard one morning. That teacher surnamed Qu, who came with us, sneaked into the coal yard and stole a few large chunks of coal, just as Old Lu Tou, who had come to work early, saw him. Burning coal chunks produces a strong, easily maintained fire. When distributing coal, people always argued with Old Lu Tou to get coal chunks, and no one wanted coal dust. Old Lu Tou never cared how fiercely you argued with him, he still distributed it half and half as usual. Most of the criticism of Old Lu Tou stemmed from this. However, Old Lu Tou did take care of the sent-down cadres, always giving them more chunks, saying, "After you get used to burning it, I won't take care of you anymore." This time, it looked like Old Lu Tou was angry. He was tilting his head with a stern face:

"What's the point of having a wire fence around the coal yard?"

There was a moment of silence. Old Qu seemed to have found a reason:

"I can't burn coal dust."

"Who gets the coal dust?"

"Give it to whoever you want!"

"If you don't want it, and he doesn't want it..."

"You can't return it to the supply station."

"Who would the supply station give it to then?"

Old Lu Tou's questions were sharp and brief. The man surnamed Qu couldn't stand there any longer, picked up the coal chunks, and left, loudly defending himself:

"I'm not taking it home."

"Am I taking it home then?"

The truth was clearly on Old Lu Tou's side. Suddenly, he turned to me, shaking his head: "Tell me, where did all that reading of his go?"

As if pricked by a needle unexpectedly, I was shaken.

Later, we became familiar with each other, and he often came to visit. Sometimes he brought lamp oil for us to use when tending the stoves at night. Sometimes he helped us check the stoves, teaching us how to burn them to save coal. He was enthusiastic and patient.

One day at noon, he came again. As we were talking, we were startled by the smell of something burning. It turned out the lunchbox I had brought and placed on the stove to heat had burned. As I was busy putting on gloves, he snatched the lunchbox down with one hand, opened it, and looked at it:

"It's a little burnt. How is it? Eating more these days!"

I told him that I could eat four steamed buns when swinging the sledgehammer the other day. He smiled approvingly.

He left, but the door wasn't closed tightly after he left. Even before I noticed, he came back to close it properly, stood there for a moment, and only left after seeing that the door didn't open again. Ah! He must have been afraid that the wind would blow in and cool my food. I had never cared about others like this, or even thought of it this way.

    老陆头
    包头钢铁公司　文执中
    去年冬天，我下放到工地体力劳动锻炼。这个工地的十几栋砖木结构小平房，已经盖起来了，剩下的是屋内的抹灰工程。北方冬季施工是需要取暖的，每间房都有一个、两个煤炉子经常生着，不然的话，不是抹不上灰，就是抹上灰也会冻裂掉。我们刚到工地不久，领导就决定让我们都去生一个时期炉子。就是在这里，我和老陆头认识的。
    生炉子是三班倒，第一天接班时，上一班的人就告诉我们：“发煤的那个老头可厉害啦！”我心里想：厉害又怎样？总不能不给煤。
    下午两点来钟，一个年青的声音在外面喊：“到东头煤场领煤罗。”等我挑着土篮晃到那里时，已有不少人排在那里。一个老头，敞开着一件铁路工人穿的棉制服，正在吃力地铲着煤块，分发给每个人。塞北的风真刺人，小杨在我前面不住的跺着脚，好容易快轮到小杨了，但老头似乎铲的更慢了，小杨嘟囔了一句：“快点装啊”！
    铲子停下来了。老陆头眯着的眼睛，现在突然大放光彩，慢慢地从小杨的头上一直打量到脚。我预感到不妙。
    “怎么？站着冷吗？自己来动手试试看。”
    小杨红着脸，接过铲去。碎煤末和较大的煤块混在一起，铲子很不容易铲进去。小杨费了很大的劲也铲不起多少，行列中有人在低声的笑，我也干替小杨着急：“谁叫你多嘴来。”老陆头一只手撑在后腰上，一只手摘下帽子扇着，他那已秃了的头顶，光光地，正冒着热气。
    “小伙子！把铲子贴着地皮铲。”他热情地指导着小杨。
    几天之后的早晨，在煤场的铁丝网旁边引起了一次争吵。和我们一道来的那位姓曲的小学教员，钻进煤场偷了几块大煤块出来，恰巧被提早上班的老陆头看见了。烧煤块，火又旺，又好烧，发煤的时候，总有人和老陆头争着要煤块，谁也不愿意要煤末子。从来老陆头不管你和他闹的怎么凶，他还是照例一样一半。对老陆头的非议，其根由也多半在这里。不过对下放干部，老陆头倒是照顾，总是多给些块，用他的话说：“过几天你们烧熟练了，就不照顾了。”这一次看样子老陆头动了火，他正歪着头板着脸：
    “煤场要围铁丝网干什么？”
    沉默了一会。老曲像找到了一条理由：
    “没有煤块我烧不了。”
    “煤末子给谁？”
    “你乐意给谁给谁！”
    “你不要，他也不要……”。
    “你不好退回给供应站。”
    “供应站又给谁呢？”
    老陆头的问题尖锐而且简短。姓曲的站不下去了，扛起煤块就走，并且大声的辩护说：
    “我又不搬回家”。
    “我难道就搬回家？”
    真理显然在老陆头这边。突然他回过头来向着我，摇了摇头：“你说，他念的书都上那儿去了？”
    像在完全没有准备时给针刺了一下那样，我震动了一下。
    以后我们搞熟了，他经常来串门。有时是送灯油来，给我们晚上添炉子用。有时帮我们看看炉子，教给我们怎样烧法才能省煤。热情、耐心。
    这天中午他又来了，谈着谈着，一股烧焦的味道，惊醒了我们。原来是我带来的放在炉子上热的饭盒烧糊了。我正忙着带手套时，他已抢着一伸手把饭盒拿了下来，打开来看了看：
    “糊了点。怎样？现在吃的多了吧！”
    我告诉他前些日子抡大镐时能吃四个馒头。他赞许地笑了。
    他走了，门却在他走后没关紧，连我都还没有察觉，他又走回来给关好，站了一下，看到门没有再打开，他才走。啊！他一定是怕风吹进来把我的饭给吹凉了。我从来没有像这样关心过别人，甚至连想都没有这样想到。
