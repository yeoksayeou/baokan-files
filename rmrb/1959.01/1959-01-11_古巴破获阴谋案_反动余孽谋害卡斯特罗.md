Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Havana: Cuba has uncovered a conspiracy to assassinate the leader of the rebel army, Castro, on the 8th. This news was announced yesterday by a Cuban revolutionary movement organization.

According to reports, the Cuban revolutionary movement organization issued a statement to the press saying that when Castro entered Havana on the 8th, five Batista elements, armed with concealed submachine guns, were lying in ambush by the roadside, attempting to assassinate Castro. However, a patrol discovered the conspiracy and immediately arrested these individuals. The statement said that the mastermind behind this assassination group has been identified as the son of Batista's police chief, Colonel Martin Perez. These criminals have now been sent to the Columbia Camp headquarters for interrogation.

To prevent any possible riots and sabotage plots, Cuban revolutionary forces are searching for weapons in Havana, as five hundred rifles and a large quantity of ammunition have been stolen.

    古巴破获阴谋案
    反动余孽谋害卡斯特罗
    新华社10日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴在8日破获了一件企图暗杀起义军领袖卡斯特罗的阴谋。这个消息是古巴的一个革命运动组织在昨天宣布的。
    据报道，古巴革命运动组织向报界发表声明说，当卡斯特罗在8日进入哈瓦那时，五个暗藏手提机关枪的巴蒂斯塔分子曾埋伏在路旁，企图暗杀卡斯特罗。但是，巡逻队发现了这个阴谋，并立即逮捕了这些人。声明说，已经查明这个暗杀集团为首的人是巴蒂斯塔警察头目马丁·佩雷兹上校的儿子。这些罪犯现在已被送往哥伦比亚营司令部去审问。
    为了防止可能发动的任何骚乱和破坏阴谋，古巴革命部队正在哈瓦那搜查武器，因为有五百枝步枪和许多弹药失窃。
