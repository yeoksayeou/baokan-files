Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 11th: Pyongyang newspapers reported today that Korean Premier Kim Il-sung, in a meeting with Japan-Korea Association Chairman Hatanaka Masaharu on the 10th, said: The Korean people and the Korean government resolutely condemn the Kishida Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" not only violates the national interests of the Japanese people, but also poses a serious threat to the peoples of Asian countries such as Korea, the People's Republic of China, and Vietnam, as well as to peace in the Far East and the world.

Kim Il-sung said to Hatanaka Masaharu: The so-called "Japan-South Korea Talks" cannot represent the Korean people. The "talks" conducted by the Syngman Rhee authorities, puppets of the American imperialists, and the Kishida Nobusuke government, which is isolated among the Japanese people, will not be recognized by the Korean people, no matter what decisions are made.

Kim Il-sung expressed his gratitude to the Japan-Korea Association and people from all walks of life in Japan for their efforts to realize the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. Kim Il-sung said that the Republic government cannot stand idly by while Korean residents in Japan suffer misfortune in foreign countries. He said that the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan is their legitimate right, and no one may infringe upon it. The Republic government has made preparations for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the Korean people hope to develop friendly relations with the Japanese people, and no matter how the reactionary Kishida Nobusuke government obstructs it, it cannot stop the sincere desire of the two peoples.

Hatanaka Masaharu told Premier Kim Il-sung: The Japanese people's desire to develop friendly relations with the Korean people is growing, and the Japanese people actively support the repatriation movement of Korean residents in Japan and oppose the Kishida government's obstruction of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 10th: Hatanaka Masaharu, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Association, who is currently visiting Korea, said at a press conference held in Pyongyang today that the broad masses of the Japanese people sympathize with and support the repatriation movement of Korean residents in Japan.

He pointed out that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has three million members, passed a resolution in December of last year supporting the repatriation of Korean residents to their homeland. He said that people from all walks of life, such as Japanese cultural figures and farmers, as well as public opinion, have also expressed their support.

Hatanaka Masaharu said that the Kishida Nobusuke government is preventing Korean residents in Japan from returning to their country in order to maintain the ongoing Japan-Rhee talks.

Hatanaka Masaharu stated that he will further launch mass movements and mobilize public opinion, and will hold a Japanese National Congress in Tokyo in February to promote the realization of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Hatanaka Masaharu visited Korea for ten days and visited factories and rural areas in various places. When talking about his impressions of this visit to Korea, he said that Korea's construction is progressing rapidly. He had been to Pyongyang more than three years ago, and he hardly recognized it this time. He said that the Korean people are united and waging a tenacious struggle, which gives people a strong impression.

    金日成首相接见日朝协会理事长时指出
    旅日朝鲜侨民归国权利不容侵犯
    畑中政春说日本广大人民支持旅日朝鲜侨民归国
    新华社平壤11日电　平壤报纸今天报道，朝鲜内阁首相金日成10日在接见日朝协会理事长畑中政春时说：朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府坚决谴责岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋。他说，日美“安全条约”不仅违背日本人民的民族利益，而且是对朝鲜、中华人民共和国、越南等亚洲各国人民，以及对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    金日成首相对畑中政春说：所谓“日韩会谈”是不能代表朝鲜人民的。美帝国主义者的傀儡李承晚当局和在日本人民中孤立的岸信介政府进行的“会谈”即使做出什么决定，朝鲜人民也是不承认的。
    金日成首相对日朝协会和日本各界人士为旅日朝侨归国的实现所进行的努力表示感谢。金日成说，旅日朝侨在外国遭受不幸，共和国政府也不能袖手旁观。他说，旅日朝侨归国是他们正当的权利，任何人也不得侵犯，共和国政府已经为旅日朝侨归国做好了准备。
    金日成首相说，朝鲜人民希望同日本人民发展友好关系，无论反动的岸信介政府如何阻挠，也挡不住两国人民的这种真诚的愿望。
    畑中政春对金日成首相说：日本人民希望发展同朝鲜人民的友好关系的愿望日益高涨，日本人民积极支持旅日朝侨的归国运动，反对岸政府阻挠旅日朝侨归国的行为。
    新华社平壤10日电　正在朝鲜访问的日朝协会理事长畑中政春今天在平壤举行的记者招待会上说，日本广大人民同情和支持旅日朝鲜侨民归国的运动。
    他指出，拥有三百万会员的日本工会总评议会已经在去年12月间通过决议，支持朝鲜侨民回国。他说，日本文化界人士和农民等各阶层人民和社会舆论也都表示支持。
    畑中政春说，岸信介政府不让旅日朝鲜侨民回国，目的是要维持正在进行的日李会谈。
    畑中政春表示，今后将进一步发起群众运动和发动社会舆论，并且要在2月间在东京举行日本国民大会，以促进旅日朝鲜侨民归国的实现。
    畑中政春这次到朝鲜访问了十天，参观了各地的工厂和农村。他在谈到这次访问朝鲜的印象时说，朝鲜的建设进行得很快，他在三年多以前曾经到过平壤，这次来时几乎认不出来了。他说，朝鲜人民团结一致，进行顽强的斗争，给人以强烈的印象。
