Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 29th: The call for a change in American foreign policy from the American public has become even stronger since the recent visit of Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan to the United States, which has made the Dulles clique very uneasy.

During his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, Dulles tried his best to pour cold water on this legitimate desire of the American public, frightening those who favored easing international tensions by saying that "every specific proposal made by the Soviets to promote the end of the 'Cold War' has always been a proposal to weaken our will or ability to resist international communism in order to achieve its worldwide goals."

Mikoyan, who visited the United States, had just left, and American government officials came out one after another to express their opposition to easing international tensions, their opposition to improving Soviet-American relations, and to spread the atmosphere that Soviet peace proposals were "insincere." Assistant Secretary of State Murphy specifically chose the Detroit Economic Club on the 26th to deliver this speech, whose members had invited Mikoyan to speak just two weeks earlier. Dulles' testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday was his second public speech in two days. The day before, he had already made similar remarks at a press conference; the same day, Vice President Nixon also shouted at a banquet in New York that "in the current climate of the world, the possibility of a thaw is very small," and attacked the Soviet Union in a big way.

The American ruling group is clearly launching another propaganda campaign against the Soviet Union, against communism, and against easing international tensions, attempting to counter the fierce accusations and criticisms of American foreign policy at home and abroad, and to eliminate the impact of Mikoyan's visit to the United States on the American public and the increasingly high desire for peace, so that they can continue to implement their policy of exacerbating international tensions.

During his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, Dulles tried to pretend that he was also in favor of changing American foreign policy, saying, "These days, people often say that so many changes are taking place in the world, so our foreign policy must also be changeable. I personally often say this, and the sincerity of this belief is expressed not only in words but also in actions." He also tried to prove that the current US foreign policy was indeed "adapted to the requirements of the new situation, and exerted influence on the new developments that are now appearing in politics, economics, and science," rather than being stubbornly rigid, as people constantly accuse it of being.

Dulles continued, "However, there are some people who seem to think that we should formulate some new policies that, according to them, will 'end the Cold War'." Dulles expressed his firm refusal to implement such a policy, and he had no other way to defend his attitude than to once again bring up the "communist threat" to scare the American public. But Dulles inadvertently showed that what he feared most was the easing of tensions, and he was very worried that implementing a policy to end the "Cold War" would "make many careless people feel relieved and feel that our country no longer needs to make the efforts and sacrifices that it now needs to make."

But Dulles tried his best to push the responsibility for the "Cold War" onto the Soviet Union. He turned a blind eye to the facts and said, "To be sure, the United States does not covet anything owned by the Soviet Union or any other people." Dulles made it seem as if the "Cold War" existed only because of the international communist movement. He said that the "Cold War" originated from "the beliefs of the international communist movement" and originated from the fact that the international communist movement "controls the policies and resources of about 900 million people..." Dulles even believed that "atheism and materialism" were also the origins of the "Cold War." However, Dulles's position and clamor against peaceful coexistence and against the international communist movement proved precisely that the origin of the "Cold War" was in himself.

Dulles also attempted to deny what Mikoyan said, that there was a difference between the US government's policies and the opinions of the American people on the issue of ending the "Cold War." He admitted that the opinions on peace aspirations, goodwill, friendship, easing tensions, increasing trade, etc., that Mikoyan had heard in the United States were the "ardent wishes" of the American people. But he believed that these were only "general opinions," while the US government needed to deal with "specific issues." and said, "On specific issues, the American people and their government have a great degree of agreement." He said, "I know that people often can't help but seize on words that seem likely to end the constant state of tension, burden, and risk in which we find ourselves." He said with complete disregard for the wishes of the American people and with an arrogant attitude of refusing to consider any Soviet proposals, "Every specific proposal made by the Soviets to promote the end of the 'Cold War' has always been a proposal to weaken our will or ability to resist international communism in order to achieve its worldwide goals."

Dulles slandered the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals on expanding Soviet-American trade and on ending the occupation of West Berlin and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and shouted hoarsely, "The Soviet proposals are not medicine, but poison, a poison that will make us unable to feel the real danger, a danger that will become more serious than ever."

### 坚持冷战政策　抵挡舆论压力杜  勒斯向美国公众拚命泼冷水

    坚持冷战政策　抵挡舆论压力杜
    勒斯向美国公众拚命泼冷水
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国公众主张改变美国外交政策的呼声，在最近苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬访美以后已更加高涨，这使得杜勒斯之流很感不安。
    杜勒斯昨天在美国众议院外交委员会上作证时竭力对美国公众这种正当愿望泼冷水，他吓唬赞成缓和国际紧张局势的人说，“苏联人提出的促进结束‘冷战’的每一项具体建议从来都是为了削弱我们抵抗国际共产主义的意志或能力以达到它世界范围的目标的建议”。
    访问美国的米高扬刚刚离开，美国政府负责人就接二连三地出来表示反对缓和国际紧张局势，反对改善苏美关系，并且大肆散布苏联和平建议“没有诚意”的空气。副国务卿帮办墨菲26日特意挑选了底特律经济俱乐部来发表这种演说，这个俱乐部的成员刚在两个星期以前邀请了米高扬去演说。杜勒斯昨天在众议院外交委员会的作证是他在两天之内公开发表的第二篇谈话。在前一天，他已经在记者招待会上发表了类似的言论；同一天，副总统尼克松也在纽约一个宴会上叫喊“在世界目前的气候下，解冻的可能性很小”，并且对苏联大肆攻击。
    美国统治集团显然正在再度掀起一次反苏、反共、反缓和国际紧张局势的宣传运动，企图以此来对付国内外对美国外交政策的猛烈指责和批评，并消除米高扬访美对美国公众引起的影响和更加高涨的和平愿望，以便他们可以继续执行他们的加剧国际紧张局势的政策。
    杜勒斯昨天在众议院外交委员会上企图装作他也是赞成改变美国外交政策的人，他说：“这些天来人们经常在说，世界上正在发生那么多的变化，因此我国的外交政策也必须是可以改变的。我个人也时常这样说，而这种信念的真诚不仅表现在言词上，而且表现在行动上”。他还企图证明美国目前的对外政策已经确实是“适应于新情况的要求，并且对于现在正在政治、经济和科学方面出现的新的演变施以影响”的，而不是像人们所不断指责的那样，是顽固僵硬的。
    杜勒斯接着说：“可是，有这样一些人，看来他们认为我们应该拟订一些据他们说会‘结束冷战’的新政策”。杜勒斯表示断然拒绝执行这样的政策，他没有别的办法来为自己的这种态度辩护，只好又一次抬出“共产主义威胁”来恫吓美国公众。但杜勒斯无意中表明，他最怕的就是紧张空气的缓和，他非常耽心，执行结束“冷战”政策就会“使许多不留心的人们觉得松了一口气，并且觉得我们的国家不再需要作那种现在需要作的努力和牺牲了。”
    但杜勒斯却竭力想把“冷战”的责任推在苏联头上。他闭着眼睛不顾事实地说：“肯定地说，美国丝毫也不垂涎苏联和任何其他人民所拥有的东西”。杜勒斯把事情说成是：仿佛只因为有了国际共产主义运动，所以才有了“冷战”。他说什么“冷战”起源于“国际共产主义运动的信仰”，起源于国际共产主义运动“控制着大约九亿人民的政策和资源……”。杜勒斯甚至认为“无神论和唯物主义”也是“冷战”的起源。可是，杜勒斯这种反对和平共处、同国际共产主义运动不共戴天的立场和叫嚣，恰好证明了“冷战”的起源就在他自己身上。
    杜勒斯还企图否认米高扬所说的，在结束“冷战”问题上美国政府的政策和美国人民的意见之间存在着分歧。他承认米高扬在美国听到过的关于和平愿望、善意、友好、缓和紧张局势、增加贸易等等的意见是美国人民“热烈的愿望”。但他认为这些都只是“泛泛的意见”，而美国政府需要处理的却是“具体的问题”。并说“在具体问题方面，美国人民和他们的政府有很大程度的一致”。他说，“我知道人们往往会情不自禁地抓住看来可能结束我们目前所处的经常的紧张状态、负担和风险的言词”。他以完全无视美国人民这种愿望和蛮横地、拒不考虑苏联任何建议的态度说，“苏联人提出的促进结束‘冷战’的每项具体建议从来都是为了削弱我们抵抗国际共产主义的意志或能力以达到它世界范围的目标的建议。”
    杜勒斯对苏联关于扩大苏美贸易和关于结束西柏林的占领地位以及缔结对德和约等合理建议进行了诬蔑，并且声嘶力竭地叫喊，“苏联的建议并不是良药，而是毒品，这种毒品会使我们感觉不到真正的危险，这种危险会变得比以往任何时候更加严重”。
