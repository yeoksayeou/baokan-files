Logistics Soldiers Catch Up

    The logistics soldiers of the Steel Marshal - mining, coal mining, and coking workers - in the greater leap forward of 1959, have mustered their energy and launched a vigorous movement for high quality and high output. Their slogan is: Ensure the Marshal eats his fill and eats well, and take down 18 million tons of steel as soon as possible.

    钢铁元帅的后勤兵——采矿、采煤和炼焦工人，在更大跃进的1959年里，鼓足了干劲，展开了一个轰轰烈烈的高质量、多产量运动。他们的口号是：保证元帅吃得饱、吃得好，早日拿下1800万吨钢。
