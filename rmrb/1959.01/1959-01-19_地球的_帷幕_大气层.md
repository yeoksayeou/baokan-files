    Earth's "Curtain" - The Atmosphere
    Su Li
    If there were no atmosphere...
    Our Earth is immersed in an ocean of air. This layer of air that wraps around the Earth is called the atmosphere.

    What exactly is the Earth's atmosphere made of? There have been various claims. Greek philosophers believed that air was one of the basic elements in the universe, an indivisible substance. However, in the eighteenth century, scientists accurately analyzed the composition of the atmosphere, proving that it is neither an element nor a compound, but a mixture of various gases, water vapor, and dust. The main components of Earth's atmosphere are: 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of gases such as helium, hydrogen, argon, krypton, neon, and xenon. Near the ground, there are also small amounts of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and some dust impurities. The atmosphere is approximately one thousand kilometers thick, but most of its mass is in the lower layers, near the ground. Therefore, air is heavier in the lower layers. At sea level, one cubic meter of air weighs 1.3 kilograms. Our bodies are under a great deal of air pressure; every square centimeter of area is subjected to one kilogram of pressure. However, our bodily structures have become accustomed to this pressure. Moreover, air presses from all directions – up, down, left, right, inside, and out – with equal pressure and opposite directions, so people do not feel the air pressure at all. On the contrary, people cannot survive if they leave this air pressure. For example, when we climb mountains or fly in airplanes, the higher we go, the thinner the air, and the lower the air pressure, the more uncomfortable we feel. To a certain limit, people cannot survive, and that is the reason.
    The Earth's atmosphere is extremely important to human survival. Everyone knows that humans, animals, and even plants need to breathe, which requires air. Air molecules in the atmosphere refract and scatter intense sunlight, giving our sky its clear, azure blue color. It also acts like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing gentle sunlight to warm the ground while preventing heat from escaping. Weather phenomena such as wind, clouds, rain, and snow can only occur in the atmosphere. If there were no atmosphere around the Earth, it would be like this: in a cloudless, dark sky, a dazzling sun would hang, without a trace of wind, without a drop of rain, the night would be terribly cold, and the surroundings would be a barren, cracked land...

      A Look Inside the Atmosphere
    The temperature of the atmosphere is hotter closer to the ground because it is not directly heated by solar radiation, but by heat energy reflected from the ground. However, hot air is lighter than cold air, so the hot air near the ground often rises, and the colder air above sinks, until it is heated and rises again. This flow is called convection. However, atmospheric convection only occurs near the ground, generally in the region 10 to 12 kilometers above the ground, 16 to 17 kilometers at the equator, and 9 to 11 kilometers at the poles. We call this layer of the atmosphere the troposphere. Weather phenomena such as wind and rain occur in the troposphere, and almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere is concentrated here, and various shapes of clouds only form here. Further up, to an altitude of 80 kilometers, convection does not exist. The air there is very thin, with almost no vertical flow, only horizontal flow. This layer of the atmosphere is called the stratosphere. In the troposphere, the temperature decreases by 5-6 degrees for every kilometer of altitude, which is an important characteristic of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, the temperature of the bottom layer is relatively stable. Above are warm layers (up to 75 degrees Celsius) and cold layers (minus 50 degrees Celsius).
    Here, I want to especially mention ozone. Its concentration is highest at an altitude of 22 to 25 kilometers in the stratosphere. Ozone is produced during lightning storms. After a thunderstorm, there is a pungent odor in the air, which is ozone (ordinary oxygen is divalent - O2, ozone is trivalent - O3). It is a protective gaseous armor for all life on Earth because ozone has the ability to absorb ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It retains most of the intense ultraviolet rays that are harmful to animals, plants, and humans, and only a portion of the ultraviolet rays reach the ground, becoming beneficial and harmless.
    The layer of atmosphere from 80 kilometers to about 1,000 kilometers is called the ionosphere. In the ionosphere, the air is extremely thin. The action of solar ultraviolet radiation causes oxygen molecules to dissociate, producing atomic oxygen. Moreover, shortwave solar radiation and solar particle radiation cause strong ionization of the air in this layer. Neutral molecules and atoms become charged particles (positive ions, negative ions, and electrons). The lower layer of the ionosphere can reflect radio waves, so people can use shortwave radio to transmit signals to distant places. In addition, within the ionosphere, the temperature roughly increases with height again.
    The atmospheric conditions described above were detected in the past using balloons, high-altitude sounding rockets, and radio waves. According to recent Soviet artificial satellite detection results, at an altitude of 266 kilometers above the ground, the atmospheric density is one ten-billionth of the density at the Earth's surface. For every 100 kilometers of altitude increase, the atmospheric density decreases to one-tenth to one-twelfth of the original density. In the ionosphere, the main component is atomic oxygen ions, and atomic nitrogen ions have also been recorded. Furthermore, there is still air present at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (there are significant numbers of ions there). Therefore, the atmosphere extends very far into the high altitude, much farther than previously thought. According to the old concept, the Earth's atmosphere would transition into interstellar gas.

    Both Advantages and Disadvantages
    The Earth's atmosphere has both advantages and disadvantages for us. We have already discussed some of the significance of the atmosphere to human survival above. However, it also brings some difficulties to astronomical work. For example, when we study the chemical composition and physical state of distant celestial bodies, we use spectral analysis, that is, analyzing the light they emit. However, the Earth's atmosphere blocks part of the light emitted by celestial bodies, which prevents us from receiving all the light. Molecules in the air cause the sun to refract and scatter, creating the brightness of the sky's "background," which forms a considerably bright "background" even at night, making many important research works difficult to carry out. The flow of the Earth's atmosphere and its various complex movements and changes cause the light emitted by celestial bodies to flicker continuously, which is very unfavorable for astronomical work. The instability and disturbances of Earth's atmospheric molecules also affect the magnification of telescopes, which also hinders astronomical observations. To get rid of these limitations, we must leave the Earth's atmosphere. If we could conduct astronomical work on planets without an atmosphere or with a relatively thin atmosphere, we would surely obtain many valuable data.
    The Earth's atmosphere is also closely related to interstellar navigation. When we launch artificial satellites or space rockets, we must first pass through this layer of air clothing to leave the Earth. Thus, we must carefully consider air resistance. Under normal circumstances, air resistance is proportional to the square of the object's speed, that is, when the speed doubles, the resistance quadruples. However, for rockets traveling at high speeds, the resistance is much greater than calculated by this formula. Due to the violent impact and friction between the rocket and the air, the rocket shell becomes hotter and hotter, even to a red-hot state (especially the head that impacts the air). According to experimental results, when the rocket speed is six kilometers per second, the temperature of the rocket head is as high as 5,000 degrees. Therefore, on the one hand, we must study the use of high-temperature resistant materials to manufacture rocket shells, especially the head, and on the other hand, the speed of the rocket through the atmosphere cannot be too high. Therefore, rockets are generally launched vertically to minimize the distance in the atmosphere and the time spent passing through the atmosphere. Even with such a launch, the rocket's speed still loses 10% to 15% due to air resistance and Earth's gravity during its flight in the atmosphere.
    When returning to Earth from other planets, we must also consider the resistance of the atmosphere. Therefore, we need to follow a spiral path, gradually approaching the ground while rotating. When the speed has decreased to almost zero, we can enter the dense atmosphere near the ground, and then land on the ground. If it falls too fast, the rocket will burn up in the air like a meteor. However, the atmosphere has more advantages than disadvantages for interstellar travel. Without air resistance, the rocket would impact the ground at the second cosmic velocity, and the entire rocket would burn into gas, leaving no trace. To slow down, we would have to turn the rocket around and spray gas forward, which would burn off a lot of the most valuable fuel in interstellar travel. Using the braking effect of air resistance makes it possible to land safely without wasting fuel.

    Once past the atmosphere and into interstellar space, the absence of air also brings many difficulties to our cosmonauts. First of all, we need to breathe, so we have to store oxygen. This is easy to solve, but the lack of air pressure is a big problem. As mentioned earlier, humans are accustomed to living under normal atmospheric pressure, because only under a certain atmospheric pressure will our blood dissolve the necessary amount of oxygen. If the atmospheric pressure is insufficient, even breathing pure oxygen will not solve the human body's need for oxygen. In that case, the gases that have already dissolved in the blood (including oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, etc.) will also run out of the blood, which, if severe, will completely destroy the body's life activities. In addition, the boiling point of blood is greatly reduced under such low pressure. At our normal body temperature of thirty-seven degrees, the blood will "boil." Therefore, various preventive measures must be taken in advance, such as creating the necessary air pressure in the sealed cabin, wearing sealed flight suits or high-altitude flight suits, and so on.

      What About Other Celestial Bodies?
    When we go on interstellar travel, we must be concerned about whether other planets have an atmosphere. We now know that the moon has almost no atmosphere (its thinness is only one millionth of that of the Earth's atmosphere). Although Mars has an atmosphere, it is much thinner than the Earth's atmosphere, and most of it is nitrogen. Oxygen is only one-thousandth of that on Earth, while carbon dioxide is much more abundant than on Earth. Venus has an atmosphere one kilometer thick, but most of it is carbon dioxide. Mercury also has very little atmosphere. Other planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are basically hydrogen, with some methane and ammonia.
    As for why this is the case, it involves issues such as the origin and evolution of planets, which are quite complex to discuss, and scientists have different views on the origin of planets. For example, regarding the formation of the Earth's atmosphere, some people believe that it may be closely related to the Earth's heating. According to their theory, the Earth was formed by the merging of solid particles. Later, due to the fission of radioactive elements (such as uranium, thorium, and radium) inside the Earth, high temperatures were produced. As the Earth's internal heat increased, it released a small amount of gas and water vapor contained in the Earth's gravelly material. They rose to the Earth's surface, the water vapor condensed into oceans, and the gas became the atmosphere. Of course, the composition of the original atmosphere was different from today's, and the Earth's current atmospheric composition is largely related to the existence of the Earth's surface flora and fauna. There are also some other theories. As for what the truth is, it remains to be studied and observed in the future. The successful launch of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket this time will provide us with a wealth of valuable data, paving the way for solving these major problems.

    地球的“帷幕”——大气层
    苏理
    如果没有大气层
    我们的地球沉浸在空气的海洋里。这层把地球包裹起来的空气就叫做大气。
    地球大气究竟是什么组成的呢？曾经有过各种各样的说法。希腊哲学家认为，空气是宇宙中的基本元素之一，是一种不可分解的物质。但是，到了十八世纪，科学家精确地分析了大气的组成成分，证明它既不是元素，也不是化合物，而是由各种气体、水蒸汽和尘埃混合组成的。地球大气的主要成分是：78％氮、21％氧，此外还含有极少量的氦、氢、氩、氪、氖和氙等气体。在地面附近，还含有少量的二氧化碳、水蒸气和一些灰尘杂质。大气层总共大约有一千多公里厚，可是它的质量大部分在下层，也就是在地面附近。因此，空气越在下层越重。在海平面上，一立方公尺的空气便有一点三公斤重。我们身上就有很重的空气压着，每平方公分的面积就有一公斤压力。不过，我们的身体组织机构，已经习惯这种压力了；再说，上上下下，左右前后，里里外外，全都有空气压着，压力相等，方向相反，所以人们根本不感到空气的压力。相反，人们一离开空气这种压力，倒反而不能生活下去了。比如，我们爬山或坐飞机，由于越往上去，空气越稀薄，气压越低，越感到不好受；低到一定限度，人就无法生存，就是这个道理。
    地球大气对人类生存的意义是极其重大的。大家都知道，人和动物，哪怕植物都要呼吸，也就需要空气。大气层中的空气分子，能把强烈的太阳光折射、散射，使我们的天空呈现着清朗的蔚蓝色。它还像温室的玻璃一样，能放过柔和的太阳光使地面温暖，而又不让热跑到外面去。还有像风、云、雨和雪等天气现象，也都必须在大气中才能发生。如果地球周围没有大气层，那么它就会成这个样子：在万里无云的黑黝黝的天空中，挂着一个亮得刺眼的太阳，没有一丝风，没有一滴雨，夜里是可怕的寒冷，周围是一片光秃秃的干裂土地……。
      剖开大气层来看
    大气层的温度是越靠近地面越热，因为烘热大气的不是直接的太阳辐射，而是从地面反射上去的热能。但是，热空气比冷空气轻，所以靠近地面的热空气常常要往上升，而上空的较冷的空气就沉下来，等到烘热了又往上升。这样的流动叫做对流。不过，大气的对流现象只在地面附近发生，一般是离地面十至十二公里这个区域，在赤道地方是十六至十七公里，在两极地方是九至十一公里。我们把大气的这一层叫做对流层。刮风下雨等天气现象都在对流层中发生，大气中水汽几乎全集中在这里，各种形状的云也仅在这里形成。再上去直到八十公里高空，对流现象就不存在。那里的空气已很稀薄，几乎没有垂直流动，只有水平流动。这一层大气叫平流层，在对流层内，每升高一公里，温度便降低5—6度，这是对流层的重要特性；在平流层内，底层温度是比较稳定的。上面还有暖层（达摄氏75度）和冷层（零下50度）。
    这里要特别提一提臭氧。它在平流层中二十二至二十五公里高处含量最多。臭氧是在闪电时产生的。雷暴以后，空中里有一股臭味，这就是臭氧（一般氧是两价的——O2，臭氧是三价的——O3）。它是保护地球上一切生命的气体盔甲，因为臭氧有吸收太阳辐射中的紫外线的本领，是它扣留了大部分对动植物和人类有害的强烈的紫外线，而仅到达地面的一部分紫外线，就成了有益无害的了。
    八十公里以上一直延伸到一千公里左右的一层大气，叫电离层。在电离层内，空气极其稀薄。太阳紫外线的作用，引起氧分子离解而产生原子的氧。并且，太阳短波辐射和太阳的微粒放射，引起这一层内空气强烈的电离作用。中性的分子和原子已成了带电的粒子（正离子、负离子和电子）。电离层的低层能够反射无线电波，这样人们才能利用短波无线电，把信号传到较远的地方去。此外，在电离层的范围内，温度大概又重新随高度逐增。
    以上介绍的大气层的情况，都是过去人们利用气球、高空探测火箭和无线电等探测出来的。根据最近苏联人造卫星探测结果，在离地面二百六十六公里的高空中，大气密度是地球表面的百亿分之一。高度每增加一百公里，大气密度就减少为原来的密度十分之一到十二分之一。在电离层这一区域中，占主要成分的是原子状态的氧离子，还记录到了原子状态的氮离子。并且，在一千公里高空处，也还是有空气存在的（那里有显著数量的离子）。因此，大气向高空伸展得很远，比早先认为的要远得多。按照旧的概念，地球大气就要转变为星际气体了。有利也有弊
    地球大气对我们有利也有弊。关于大气对人类生存的意义，上面已经谈过一些。但是，它也给天文工作带来一些困难。举例来说，我们研究遥远天体的化学组成和物理状态，是采用光谱分析，即分析它射来的光线的。但是，地球大气把天体射来的一部分光线阻挡住了，这就使我们不能接收到全部光线。空气中的分子使太阳发生折射、散射，造成了天空“背景”的亮度，即使在夜晚也形成相当亮的“背景”，这就使许多重要研究工作难以进行。地球大气的流动以及多种复杂的运动和变化，使星体所发的光不断闪动，这对天文工作十分不利。地球大气分子的不稳定和扰动，还影响到望远镜的放大倍率，这也是有碍天文观测的。为要摆脱这些限制，我们就要离开地球大气层。如果能到没有大气或者大气比较稀薄的星球上进行天文工作，那就必将得到许多宝贵的资料。
    地球大气对星际航行也有密切关系。我们发射人造卫星或宇宙火箭，要离开地球首先就得穿过这层空气外衣。这样就得很好地考虑空气的阻力。在通常情况下，空气的阻力和物体的速度的平方成正比，也就是速度为原来的二倍时，阻力为原来的四倍。但是，对高速前进的火箭来说，阻力就比用这个公式算出来的还大得多。由于火箭和空气的剧烈的冲击和摩擦，火箭壳就愈来愈热，甚至到炽热状态（特别是冲击空气的头部）。据实验结果，当火箭速度为每秒六公里时，火箭头部的温度即高达5000度。因此，我们一方面得研究用耐高温材料制造火箭外壳特别是头部，另一方面火箭通过大气层的速度也不能太大。因此，火箭一般都垂直发射，尽量缩短在大气层中的距离，和通过大气层的时间。即使这样发射，火箭速度因空气阻力和地球引力的缘故，在大气层的飞行中还要损失10％到15％。
    从其他星球回地球时，也要考虑大气层的阻力。因此，需要循螺旋线，一面打转一面渐渐接近地面。等到速度降到差不多了，才能进入靠近地面的稠密的大气层，然后再降落地面。如果落得太快，火箭就会像流星那样，在空中烧起来。不过，大气层对星际旅行来说，还是好处多。如果没有空气的阻力，火箭以第二宇宙速度撞击地面，全部火箭都会烧成气体，连一点残骨都找不到。为了降速，就得把火箭倒过头来向前喷气，因而要烧掉很多星际旅行中最宝贵的燃料。利用空气阻力的刹车作用，就有可能不费燃料，而平安降落。
    过了大气层到了星际空间，空气没有了，也给我们宇宙航行家带来不少困难。首先，我们要呼吸，那就得储备氧气。这还好办，而没有空气压力倒是个大问题。前面说过，人是习惯在正常大气压下生活的，因为只有在一定的大气压力下，我们的血液才会溶解必要数量的氧。如果大气压力不足，哪怕呼吸纯氧，也不能解决人体对氧的需要问题。而那样，原来已溶解在血液中的气体（包括氧、氮和二氧化碳等），还会从血液中跑出来，厉害的话，会使机体生命活动完全破坏。此外，血液在那样小的压力下，沸点大大减低；在我们正常的体温三十七度时，血液就“烧开”了。因此，还得事先采取种种预防措施，比如在密封舱内造成必要的气压，穿上密闭飞行衣或高空飞行服等等。
      别的天体又怎样
    我们要去星际航行，就得关心其他的星球上有没有大气。现在我们已经知道的，月亮上几乎没有大气（它的稀薄程度只是地球大气的一百万分之一）。火星表面虽然有大气，但是比地球大气薄得多，而且大部分是氮，氧只有地球上的千分之一，而二氧化碳却比地球上多得多。金星呢，有一公里厚的大气，可是大部分是二氧化碳。水星上的大气也很少。其他如木星、土星、天王星和海王星等，基本上都是氢气，还有一些甲烷和氨。
    至于为什么会形成这样的，这就涉及到行星的起源和演化等问题，谈起来比较复杂，而且科学家对于行星起源的见解还不一致。比如关于地球大气的成因，有人认为可能跟地球的发热有密切关系。根据他们的理论，地球是由固态质点并合而形成的，以后由于地球内部的放射性元素（如铀、钍和镭等）的分裂，产生了高温。地球内部热量增加，就释放出含在地球石砾物质中含量不多的气体和水蒸汽。它们冒到地球表面，水蒸汽凝结成海洋，气体变成了大气。当然，原始大气的成分和今天的不同，而今天的地球大气成分，在很大程度上又是和地球表面动植物界的存在有关系的。另外还有一些别的说法。至于到底怎样，还待今后继续研究和观察。这次苏联宇宙火箭发射成功，它将为我们取得大量珍贵的资料，为解决这些重大问题铺平道路。
