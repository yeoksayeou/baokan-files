    Little Girl Learns to Fly (Fairy Tale)
    Huang Yiqing

    Two little girls, Xiao Hua and Xiao Zhen, wanted to learn to fly to the sky every day.

    One day, they received a beautiful invitation.

    They opened it and saw that it was sent by Old Man Sun, which read:

    "Children, I heard that you want to fly to the sky, is that right? This old man also wants to see you very much. Come on, come on, next spring, we will hold a welcome party, and Sister Moon will personally greet you on the way!"

    The two little girls immediately made a wireless phone call to Old Man Sun:

      "Old Man Sun, please tell us quickly, we really want to fly, but we can't fly, what should we do? What should we do?"

    "Oh, oh, there is a way, there is a way. Learn, I heard that there are now two places on Earth where you can learn to fly. One is the Soviet Union, and the other is the United States. It's up to you to choose... Also, when you come, don't forget to call me first."

    Xiao Hua and Xiao Zhen were very happy to hear this. They decided to go to learn separately.

    Xiao Hua went to the United States to learn to fly. The one who taught her was a fat professor. When he heard that Xiao Hua wanted to learn to fly and fly to Old Man Sun's place, he said:

      "This is very easy, I guarantee you will learn it, I guarantee you will fly well, fly even better than your friend who goes to the Soviet Union to learn to fly, you don't need to worry at all!"

    Xiao Zhen went to the Soviet Union to learn to fly. The ones who taught her were many scientists. When they heard that Xiao Zhen wanted to learn to fly and fly to Old Man Sun's place, they said:

      "Great, study hard and don't be afraid of difficulties. One day, you will definitely be able to fly to Old Man Sun's place."

    Time flies so fast, a year has passed.

    Xiao Zhen and Xiao Hua made a wireless phone call:

      "Hello, I've learned it, I've learned it, okay! Let's meet at Sister Moon's place! I'll call Old Man Sun right away."

    This day was very lively. Many big bosses and capitalists from Hawaii, USA, and that fat professor came to see Xiao Hua off to the sky.

    They put paper wings on Xiao Hua. Xiao Hua flew as high as the roof and then landed, because she couldn't fly up!

    They put iron wings on Xiao Hua again. Xiao Hua flew halfway up and then landed, because she couldn't fly up!

    They put steel wings on Xiao Hua again. Xiao Hua flew higher than halfway up and then landed. This time, her leg was also broken, because she couldn't fly up!

    The American big bosses, capitalists, and that fat professor had to send Xiao Hua to the hospital. They dared not brag anymore.

    In the Soviet Union, this day was even more lively. The leaders and scientists of the Great Kremlin Palace all came to see Xiao Zhen off; and many people stretched their heads out of different windows, clapping and cheering, to send Xiao Zhen to the sky.

    Xiao Zhen flew up all at once. Her light body emitted streaks of red light in the air; she flew for a day, two days, and suddenly saw Sister Moon standing by the road, waving bouquets to welcome her.

    "Hello, Sister Moon! Have you seen my friend Xiao Hua?" Xiao Zhen asked anxiously.

    "She hasn't come yet. I heard that the fat professor in the United States can't even fly himself. Xiao Hua has tried three times but hasn't succeeded!"

    Xiao Zhen had to fly to Old Man Sun's place alone. It is said that she is still a guest at Old Man Sun's place! Sometimes, Soviet scientists can use mirrors to show her shadow; sometimes, they can even hear her happy singing!

    小姑娘学飞（童话）
    黄衣青
    两个小姑娘，小花和小真，天天想学飞上天。
    有一天，她们接到了一张美丽的请帖。
    她俩打开一看，原来是太阳公公寄来的，信上这么写：
    “孩子，听说你们想飞上天，是吗？我这老头儿也多么想看看你们，来吧，来吧，明年春天，我们将开一个欢迎会，月亮姐姐还要亲自到路上去迎接你们呢！”
    两个小姑娘，马上给太阳公公打个无线电话：
      “太阳公公，你快告诉我们，我们真想飞，可是飞不起来呀，怎么办？怎么办？”
    “哦，哦，有办法，有办法。学吧，听说现在地球上有两个地方可以学飞。一个是苏联，一个是美国，由你们自己选择吧……还有，什么时候来，可别忘了先给我打电话。”
    小花和小真，听了很高兴，她们决定分开去学。
    小花到美国去学飞，教她的是一个大胖子教授，他听说小花要学飞，要飞到太阳公公那里去，就说：
      “这个很容易，包你学会，包你飞得好，飞得比到苏联去学飞的朋友更好，你一点也用不着耽心！”
    小真到苏联去学飞，教她的是好多个科学家，他们听说小真要学飞，要飞到太阳公公那里去，就说：
      “好呀，你用心好好学习，不要怕困难，有一天，你一定能够飞到太阳公公那里去的。”
    时间过得多快呀，一年过去了。
    小真和小花打了无线电话：
      “喂，学好了，学好了，好吧！我们在月亮姐姐那儿碰头吧！我这就给太阳公公打电话。”
    这一天，好热闹呀，美国夏威夷来了好多大老板、资本家，还有那胖教授，他们来欢送小花上天。
    他们给小花插上了纸翅膀，小花飞到屋顶那么高时，就降落了，因为飞不上去啊！
    他们又给小花插上了铁翅膀，小花飞到半天时，就降落了，因为飞不上去啊！
    他们又给小花插上钢翅膀，小花飞到比半天还高时，就降落了，这次，腿也摔坏了，因为飞不上去啊！
    美国大老板、资本家和那位胖子教授，只好把小花送到医院去，他们再也不敢说大话了。
    在苏联，这一天，更热闹，大克里姆林宫的首长和科学家们，都来给小真送行；还有许许多多的人们，从不同的窗口伸出头来，拍手欢呼，送小真上天。
    小真一下子就飞起来了，她那轻飘飘的身体，在空中发出一道一道红光；她飞了一天、两天，忽然看见月亮姐姐站在路旁，挥舞花束来欢迎。
    “月亮姐姐，你好！你可看见我的朋友小花吗？”小真焦急地问。
    “没有来呀，听说美国那个胖教授自己还不会飞哩。小花飞了三次可都没有飞成功啦！”
    小真只好独自飞到太阳公公那里去，听说现在还在太阳公公那里作客呢！有的时候，苏联科学家们还可以用镜子照出她的影子；有的时候，还能够听见她快乐的歌声！左：“我有三件
      宝。”中：“让你也炼
      钢！”（附图片）
