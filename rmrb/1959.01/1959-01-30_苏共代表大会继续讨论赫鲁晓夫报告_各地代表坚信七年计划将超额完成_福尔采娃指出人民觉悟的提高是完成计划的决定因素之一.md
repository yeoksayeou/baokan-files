Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) today, after a two-hour break, to discuss Khrushchev's report on "The Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union for 1959-1965."

    Belyayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, spoke first. He said that since the 20th Congress, the construction of the Party and the country has achieved great successes. Due to the restoration of the Leninist principles of leadership within the Party, the political and production enthusiasm of the people has been further heightened. As a result of the reorganization of industry and construction, industry has greatly developed. Due to the reorganization of Machine Tractor Stations, the labor productivity of collective farms has greatly increased. He said that the Soviet people warmly support the Party's policy, considering the Party's program as a program for their own vital interests.

    Belyayev then talked about the achievements of Kazakhstan in various fields and its role in completing the Seven-Year Plan. He said that Kazakhstan has become a region with highly developed industry and agriculture. It currently ranks second in the Soviet Union in terms of commodity grain output (only after the Russian Federation), and also ranks among the top in the Soviet Union in the production of industrial products such as zinc, lead, and copper. He said that Kazakhstan's population is only one-tenth of Pakistan's, but its steel production is now twenty-two times more than Pakistan's, coal is fifty-three times more, and power generation is nineteen times more.

    He pointed out that in the next seven years, Kazakhstan will establish 240 industrial enterprises and power stations, and will rapidly develop the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industry, power industry, building materials production, coal and chemical industries. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that Kazakhstan's annual grain output will reach 1.37 billion poods by 1965. However, the working people of Kazakhstan have decided to increase this figure to 1.5 billion poods.

    Kirilenko, First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU, spoke about the historical victories achieved by the Soviet Union in all aspects since the 20th Congress. He said that due to these victories, we have the opportunity to discuss the comprehensive development of the construction of a communist society at this congress. The Soviet people regard the Seven-Year Plan as the product of the wisdom and heroism of the Party and the people, and it once again demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. He also talked in detail about the achievements of Sverdlovsk's various constructions and the specific tasks in the Seven-Year Plan.

    Next, Khvorostukhin, First Secretary of the Tula Regional Committee of the CPSU, spoke. He focused on the tasks of Tula Oblast in developing the coal, steel, electricity, and chemical industries.

    Togliatti, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, then delivered a congratulatory message to the Congress amidst warm applause.

    Larionov, First Secretary of the Ryazan Regional Committee of the CPSU, spoke about the great progress of agriculture in Ryazan Oblast. He particularly mentioned the competition initiated by Ryazan Oblast to complete the meat production targets set by the Seven-Year Plan in two to three years. He said that this task is based on completing. This year, Ryazan's meat production will double compared to last year.

    The delegates to the Congress warmly welcomed the speech of Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. The afternoon session ended at 6:20 after Duclos's speech.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued at the Grand Kremlin Palace at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today. The Congress continued to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report.

    The first speaker at the morning session was Vasily Mzhavanadze, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia. He said that Khrushchev's report is a model of creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory, and his report thoroughly stipulates the path for the further development of the Soviet state in political, state, and economic aspects. This report gives the revisionists a fatal blow, making us firmly believe that communism is no longer a distant future, but our tomorrow.

    Mzhavanadze emphasized that the Communist Party of Georgia is participating in this Congress as an unprecedentedly united party, with a firm determination to complete and over fulfill the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. He said that the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan are the embodiment of Lenin's national policy, reflecting the Communist Party's concern for the economic and cultural development of all the people of the Soviet Union.

    Mzhavanadze also cited some figures in his speech to prove that since the establishment of Soviet power, Georgia has become a highly cultured, industrially developed, and agriculturally productive republic.

    The next speaker was Kapitonov, First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that Khrushchev's report gives all party members infinite strength. In the period between the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU, the Soviet people, under the heroic Leninist leadership of the Central Committee of the CPSU, have achieved great achievements. Now, the domestic and international situation of the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly consolidated, which enables us to enter the period of comprehensively developing the construction of a communist society today.

    Kapitonov described in detail the great achievements Moscow Oblast has made in the economy over the past few years. He said that all the workers in Moscow Oblast have completed the January plan ahead of schedule in preparation for the 21st Party Congress. All the people of Moscow Oblast expressed to the Party that they will resolutely strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Fu. Semichastny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, said at the meeting that the Communist Youth League will always be a loyal assistant to the Party. He reported to the delegates of the Congress on the heroic deeds of the Soviet youth. He said that 350,000 members of the Communist Youth League and young people participated in the work of reclaiming virgin and idle land. In the Donets Coal Mine, Ukrainian youth built 37 Communist Youth League mine shafts in a short period. Young people across the country actively participated in the construction of seven large blast furnaces, four open-hearth furnaces, and the manufacture of five rolling mills, and laid 500 kilometers of railways.

    Semichastny pointed out that the Communist Youth League members and young people across the country declared 100 large-scale industrial enterprises as youth construction sites for this seven-year plan, and they will voluntarily help build ten exemplary comprehensive automated enterprises on a regular basis. Rural youth are putting their main efforts into developing animal husbandry.

    He said that young people must not only build a communist society, but also live in a communist society. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the communist education of the younger generation in the Soviet Union, so that they can become active participants in communist construction and eliminate the remnants of capitalist ideology. He mentioned the valuable initiative of establishing cultural universities in various cities and rural areas in the Soviet Union, which in many ways helps to improve the ideological level of Soviet youth.

    Semichastny also put forward some suggestions for improvement in sports, culture and art, and publishing work.

    He finally emphasized that 18 million members of the Communist Youth League are enthusiastically looking forward to realizing the magnificent cause of the Seven-Year Plan.

    Ivan Spiridonov, First Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the CPSU, said at the meeting that the 21st Party Congress is a congress of communist builders. In Leningrad, about 3 million people participated in the discussion of the draft report of the Seven-Year Plan and put forward more than 12,000 suggestions. The implementation of these suggestions will save us expenses and complete the task of the Seven-Year Plan in a shorter period of time.

    Speaking of the anti-Party group, Spiridonov said how despicable and insidious the conspiracy of the Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov clique was. If, until now, this group has only confessed to the Central Committee of the Party, then now is the time for it to confess to the highest organ of the Party—the Congress.

    Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, extended fraternal congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the working people.

    Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, extended sincere, fraternal, and fighting respect to all the delegates of the Congress on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and all peaceful and democratic forces in Germany.

    Novotny's and Ulbricht's speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants. After Ulbricht's speech, the Congress took a twenty-minute break.

    When the Congress continued, Churayev reported to the Congress on behalf of the Credentials Committee that 1,269 delegates with voting rights and 106 delegates with the right to speak attended the Congress. The Credentials Committee recognized that their representation was legitimate.

    The reporter said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union now has 7,622,356 official members and 616,775 probationary members, that is, a total of 8,239,131 communist party members, an increase of 1,023,620 members compared with the 20th Congress.

    The reporter said that among the delegates to the Congress, there were 222 female delegates, accounting for 17.5% of the total number of delegates. The delegates attending the conference represented 52 nationalities in the Soviet Union, and 45 of them joined the party between 1917 and 1920. Among the delegates, 399 were workers and collective farmers.

    The Congress approved the report of the Credentials Committee.

    Furtseva, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, spoke about the Party's ideological education work among the masses. She said that this is an issue that the Communist Party considers to be of great significance.

    Furtseva said that the Soviet state has always been strong because it relies on the awareness of the masses. Further improving the awareness of the working people is one of the decisive factors in completing the Seven-Year Plan.

    Furtseva said that now, a broad path to education has been opened to all Soviet people. Currently, there are more than 54 million people in the Soviet Union receiving various forms of education. In fact, one out of every four people is studying.

    Furtseva said that the Party believes that literature and art are a very important assistant in the struggle to build a communist society. The publication volume of Soviet books is constantly increasing. In 1931, about 99 million books were published. In 1958, the Soviet Union published more than one billion books of various kinds. Calculated per capita, the Soviet Union publishes twice as many books as the most developed capitalist countries.

    She said that Soviet literature helps the Party educate the people, helps them build a communist worldview, and cultivates their progressive and beautiful sentiments. It is precisely for this reason that Soviet literature has been attacked by foreign bourgeois critics and all kinds of revisionists. Lenin's principle of the Party spirit of literature being connected with life and the method of socialist realism are their main targets of attack.

    Furtseva emphasized that the views on leading the development of literature and art expounded in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism.

    When talking about the achievements of the Soviet film industry, Furtseva said that all means of Soviet literature and art and film should be used to complete the tasks facing the Party: to educate the people with advanced communist morality.

    Furtseva said that the achievements of Soviet culture are becoming more and more obvious to people living abroad. Bourgeois thinkers cannot come up with anything that can attract the masses to counter the thorough and pure ideas of communism. They can only slander communism and insist on portraying it as some kind of threat to civilization and culture. However, the truth is becoming more and more obvious, and it is impossible to hide it and keep the world from seeing it.

    Delegates warmly welcomed the speech of Mamai, a famous miner from Lugansk, Ukraine. On his initiative, a patriotic movement to over fulfill the daily shift quota was launched in the Donets Coal Mining Area last year, and then throughout the country.

    Mamai said that the Donbass miners warmly support the new Seven-Year Plan. After seeing Khrushchev's draft report, they expressed that they would complete the task ahead of schedule.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, congratulated the Congress.

    Janos Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, then spoke at the meeting.

    Gheorghiu-Dej's and Kadar's speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    The chairman of the meeting, Belyayev, announced that the Congress had received congratulatory telegrams from the fraternal parties of Brazil, Thailand, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic.

    The morning session of the Congress on the 29th ended here.

    The Congress continued in the afternoon of the 29th. (Attached picture)

    苏共代表大会继续讨论赫鲁晓夫报告
    各地代表坚信七年计划将超额完成
    福尔采娃指出人民觉悟的提高是完成计划的决定因素之一
    据新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天下午在休会两小时以后在四时（莫斯科时间）继续开会，讨论赫鲁晓夫所作的“关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告。
    哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记别利亚耶夫首先发言。他说，自第二十次代表大会以来，党和国家的建设获得了巨大的成就。由于在党内恢复了列宁主义的领导原则，人民群众的政治和生产热情更加高涨了。由于工业和建筑业改组的结果，工业大大发展了。由于机器拖拉机站的改组，集体农庄的劳动生产率大大提高了。他说，苏联人民热烈拥护党的政策，认为党的纲领就是自己切身利益的纲领。
    别利亚耶夫接着谈到哈萨克各方面的成就和它在完成七年计划中的作用。他说，哈萨克已经成为一个拥有高度发达的工业和农业的地区。它目前在商品谷物产量方面占苏联第二位（仅次于俄罗斯联邦），在锌、铅、铜等工业品产量上在苏联也名列前茅。他说，哈萨克的居民只有巴基斯坦的十分之一，但是现在它的钢产量比巴基斯坦多二十二倍，煤多五十三倍，发电量多十九倍。
    他指出，在今后七年内哈萨克将建立二百四十个工业企业和发电站，将快速发展黑色和有色冶金工业、动力工业、建筑材料的生产、煤炭和化学工业。七年计划规定，哈萨克谷物年产量到1965年将达到十三亿七千万普特。但是，哈萨克劳动人民决定把这个数字提高到十五亿普特。
    苏共斯维德洛夫斯克州委员会第一书记基里连科在发言中谈到第二十次代表大会以来苏联在各方面所取得的历史性的胜利时说，由于这些胜利，我们有可能在这次大会上讨论全面展开共产主义社会建设。苏联人民把七年计划看作党和人民的智慧和英雄气概的产物，它再一次显示出社会主义制度的优越性。他还详细谈到了斯维德洛夫斯克各项建设的成就和在七年计划中的具体任务。
    接着，苏共图拉州委员会第一书记赫沃罗斯图辛发言。他着重谈到了图拉州发展煤炭、钢铁、电力、化学工业的任务。
    意大利共产党中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂随后在热烈掌声中向代表大会致贺词。
    苏共梁赞州委员会第一书记拉里昂诺夫在发言中谈到梁赞州农业巨大进展的情况。他特别谈到梁赞州发起在两三年内完成七年计划所规定的肉类生产的竞赛。他说，这个任务是有根据完成的。今年梁赞州的肉类生产就要比去年增加一倍。
    大会代表热烈欢迎法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛讲话。杜克洛讲话后，下午会议在六时二十分结束。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫举行。大会继续讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。
    在上午会议上首先发言的是格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会第一书记瓦西里·姆日阿瓦纳泽。他说，赫鲁晓夫的报告是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论的典范，他的报告详尽地规定了苏维埃国家在政治、国家和经济方面进一步发展的道路。这个报告给修正主义者以致命的打击，使我们坚信共产主义已不是遥远的未来，而是我们的明天。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽强调指出，格鲁吉亚共产党作为空前团结一致的党来参加这次代表大会，它以坚定的决心来完成和超额完成发展国民经济的七年计划。他说，七年计划的控制数字是列宁的民族政策的体现，它反映了共产党对苏联全体人民经济和文化发展的关怀。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽在发言中还引证了一些数字来证明：格鲁吉亚在苏维埃政权建立以来，已经成为一个具有高度文化的、工业发达和农业高产的共和国。
    接着发言的是苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会第一书记卡皮托诺夫。他说，赫鲁晓夫的报告给全体党员以无限的力量。在苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会之间的时期内，苏联人民在英勇的列宁式的苏共中央的领导下，取得了极大的成绩。现在，苏联的国内和国际情况是空前地巩固了，这使我们今天有条件进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。
    卡皮托诺夫详细地叙述了莫斯科州几年来在经济上所获得的巨大成就。他说，莫斯科州全体劳动者为迎接第二十一次党代表大会已提前完成了1月份的计划。莫斯科州全体人民向党表示要坚决为提前完成七年计划而奋斗。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记符·谢米恰斯内伊在会上说，共青团永远是党的忠实助手。他向大会代表们报告了苏联青年的英雄事迹。他说，有三十五万共青团员和青年参加了开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作。在顿?茨煤矿，乌克兰青年在短期内建成了三十七个共青团矿井。全国青年积极参加了建筑七个大型高炉、四个平炉和制造五台轧钢机的工作，并铺建了五百公里的铁路。
    谢米恰斯内伊指出，全国共青团员和青年宣布一百个规模宏大的工业企业为这个七年计划的青年建筑工地，他们将自愿经常帮助建筑十个示范性的综合自动化企业。农村青年正把自己的主要力量投入发展畜牧业。
    他说，青年们不仅要建设共产主义社会，而且要在共产主义社会中生活。因此，必须加强对苏联年轻一代的共产主义教育，使他们成为共产主义建设的积极参加者，消灭资本主义思想残余。他提到在苏联各个城市和农村中建立文化大学的宝贵的倡议，这种学校在许多方面有助于苏联青年思想水平的提高。
    谢米恰斯内伊并就体育、文化艺术和出版工作提出一些改进意见。
    他最后强调说，一千八百万共青团员都热烈希望实现七年计划的宏伟事业。
    苏共列宁格勒州委员会第一书记伊凡·斯皮里多诺夫在会上发言说，第二十一次党代表大会是共产主义建设者的代表大会。在列宁格勒，约有三百万人参加了对七年计划报告提纲的讨论，并提出了一万二千多条建议。这些建议的实现将使我们节省开支，并在较短时期内完成七年计划的任务。
    斯皮里多诺夫在谈到反党集团时说，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫阴谋集团的企图是多么卑鄙和阴险。如果到目前为止，这个集团仅仅是对党的中央委员会交代，那末现在是它向党的最高机关——代表大会交代的时候了。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼代表捷克斯洛伐克共产党和劳动人民向代表大会表示兄弟般的祝贺。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希代表德国统一社会党和德国一切和平民主力量，向代表大会的全体代表致衷心的、兄弟般的、战斗的敬意。
    诺沃提尼和乌布利希的讲话受到与会者的热烈欢迎。乌布利希讲话后，大会休息二十分钟。
    大会继续开会时，丘拉耶夫代表资格审查委员会向大会报告说，出席代表大会的有一千二百六十九名有表决权的代表和一百零六名有发言权的代表。资格审查委员会承认他们的代表权是合法的。
    报告人说，现在苏联共产党共有七百六十二万二千三百五十六名正式党员和六十一万六千七百七十五名预备党员，即共有八百二十三万九千一百三十一名共产党员，比第二十次代表大会时增加了一百零二万三千六百二十名党员。
    报告人说，在代表大会的代表中，有二百二十二名妇女代表，占代表人数的17.5％。出席大会的代表们代表着苏联五十二个民族，他们当中有四十五人是在1917年到1920年期间入党的。代表中有三百九十九人是工人和集体农民。
    代表大会批准了资格审查委员会的报告。
    苏共中央主席团委员福尔采娃在发言中谈到了党在群众中的思想教育工作。她说，这是共产党认为具有重大意义的问题。
    福尔采娃说，苏维埃国家之所以始终强大，是因为它依靠了群众的觉悟。进一步提高劳动人民的觉悟是完成七年计划的决定性因素之一。
    福尔采娃说，现在，已经为全体苏联人民打开了受教育的广阔道路。目前苏联共有五千四百多万人受到各种不同形式的教育。实际上，每四个人当中就有一个人在学习。
    福尔采娃说，党认为文学艺术是自己在建成共产主义社会的斗争中一个非常重要的助手。苏联书籍的出版量正在不断增加。1931年出版的书籍约为九千九百万册，1958年苏联出版的各种书籍达到十亿册以上。按人口平均计算，苏联出版的书籍，比最发达的资本主义国家多两倍。
    她说，苏联文学帮助党教育人民，帮助他们建立共产主义世界观和培养他们具有进步的优美情操。正因为如此，苏联文学才遭到了国外资产阶级批评家和形形色色的修正主义者的攻击。列宁关于文学同生活联系的党性原则、社会主义现实主义方法是他们所选择的主要攻击目标。
    福尔采娃强调指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中阐述的关于领导文学和艺术发展的观点，同马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处。
    福尔采娃在谈到苏联电影事业的成就时说，苏联文学艺术和电影的一切手段都应当被用来完成党所面临的任务：以先进的共产主义道德来教育人民。
    福尔采娃说，苏联文化的成就对生活在外国的人们来说是越来越明显了。资产阶级的思想家不能拿出任何能够吸引广大群众的东西来对抗共产主义透彻和纯洁的思想。他们只能对共产主义进行诬蔑，硬把它说成是对文明和文化的某种威胁。但是，真理已经越来越明显，要把它隐藏起来，让世界看不见是不可能的。
    代表们热烈地欢迎了乌克兰洛干斯克市的著名矿工马马伊的发言。根据他的倡议去年在顿?茨煤矿区，随后在全国各地展开了争取超额完成每日当班定额的爱国运动。
    马马伊说，顿巴斯矿工热烈拥护新的七年计划。他们在看到赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲以后表示要提前完成任务。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治向代表大会祝贺。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔接着在会上讲了话。
    乔治乌—德治和卡达尔的讲话受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    会议主席别利亚耶夫宣布，代表大会收到了巴西、泰国、巴拉圭和多米尼加共和国的兄弟党的贺电。
    代表大会29日上午会议到此结束。
    29日下午，大会继续开会。（附图片）
