Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Washington dispatch: The Boston *Christian Science Monitor* published an article on December 30th last year by its business and financial editor, Nat White, who believes that the establishment of the "Common Market" by the six Western European countries will cause the Western countries to fall apart.

	White first pointed out that West Germany's position will be strengthened due to the establishment of the "Common Market." He said: "Competition is the essence of this economic plan (referring to the "Common Market" plan). Within the European market system, competition may put what can probably be called the world's smartest, very cunning, and most outstanding salesmen, namely the German (West German) industrialists, in a dominant position."

	White then talked about the contradictions between the Sterling Area and the "Common Market." He wrote: "Economists hopefully talk about the prospect of the Commonwealth or Sterling Area gradually merging with this European economic force. This is what everyone hopes for. However, the situation basically contains conflict. The (British) Commonwealth area will be an economic force that is deliberately trying to enter this new market area. However, after this European market system has gained some experience and gradually has its own leading economic leaders, it will become powerful enough to build a barrier against the Commonwealth Group."

	When talking about the impact of the establishment of the "Common Market" on the United States, White wrote: "For the first time since the end of World War II, the United States has encountered increasingly powerful economic competition from its partners in the free world system. ... The United States is discovering that it is no longer the only huge economic force in the free world."

	On the other hand, White expressed the hope that "European integration may strengthen the position of the United States." He emphasized that this requires "the use of diplomatic means and the establishment of strong economic barriers."

	White also pointed out, "In 1958, 2.25 billion US dollars of gold flowed from the United States to Europe, most of which was due to Europeans doing so much business elsewhere rather than with the United States."

	He said, "American businessmen may find that they need new methods, new concessions, and new appeal for their products so that they can participate in this European market. ... It is certain that the existence of this fourth economic force (the other three economic forces refer to the Dollar Area, the Sterling Area, and the socialist camp market) is a major challenge to the United States."

	Faced with this situation, White proposed a plan to strengthen the plundering of economically underdeveloped countries in an attempt to alleviate the contradictions between major capitalist countries' economic groups. He said, "It (the Common Market) can enter regions like India, Africa, and Latin America and will become an effective competitor for the free world against the communists. It can do this, that is to say, if there is the necessary basic work, diplomatic skills, and superb leadership, on the one hand, it can prevent the conflict between this group and the Commonwealth, and on the other hand, it can prevent the conflict between this group and the US trade zone."

	Nevertheless, White still expressed great concern that conflicts will occur between the "Common Market" group and the Commonwealth, and between this group and the Dollar Area.

	He concluded pessimistically: If the West "should become a divided and conflicting force, if the (Western) world falls apart due to trade wars in a dozen different places, it would be a tragedy for the free world."

    “共同市场”成立使资本主义世界经济斗争加剧
    美报担心西方国家将四分五裂
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：波士顿“基督教科学箴言报”去年12月30日刊载了该报商业和财政编辑纳特·怀特写的一篇文章，他认为西欧六国“共同市场”的成立将使得西方国家四分五裂。
    怀特首先指出，西德的地位将因为“共同市场”的成立而加强。他说：“竞争是这个经济计划（指“共同市场”计划）的本质。在欧洲市场体系内，竞争可能使得大概可以称得上是世界上最聪明、很狡猾、最出色的推销商人，即德国（西德）工业家，处于支配地位。”
    怀特接着谈到了英镑区同“共同市场”的矛盾，他写道：“经济学家们满怀希望地谈论着英联邦或英镑区同这支欧洲经济力量逐渐合并的前景。这是大家希望的事。可是局势基本上包含着冲突。（英）联邦地区将是一支处心积虑地想打进这个新市场区的经济力量。但是，在这个欧洲市场体系取得了某些经验和逐渐地有了它自己的主导经济领袖之后，它将变得强大有力，足以建立起一道对付英联邦集团的壁垒。”
    在谈到“共同市场”的成立对于美国的影响时，怀特写道：“自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国第一次遇到了它在自由世界体系内的伙伴的越来越有力的经济竞争。……美国正在发现，它已经不再是自由世界唯一巨大的经济力量了。”
    另一方面，怀特又表示希望，“欧洲整体化或许会加强美国的地位”，他强调，这就必需“运用外交手段和建立有力的经济屏障”。
    怀特还指出，“1958年，美国有二十二亿五千万美元的黄金流入欧洲，这大部分是由于欧洲人在别的地方而不是同美国作了那么多的买卖。”
    他说，“美国商人可能会发现，他需要新的方法、新的让步和使他的产品具有新的吸引力，以便使得他能够参加这个欧洲市场。……可以肯定，这第四个经济力量（其他三个经济力量指美元区，英镑区和社会主义阵营市场）的存在是对美国的重大挑战。”
    面对着这种情况，怀特提出了一个加强掠夺经济不发达国家的方案，以图缓和主要资本主义国家经济集团间的矛盾。他说，“它（共同市场）可以打进像印度、非洲和拉丁美洲这样的地区，并且将成为自由世界对共产党人的一个有效的竞争者。它能够做到这一步：就是说，如果有必要的基本工作，外交技巧和高超的领导，一方面能够防止这个集团和英联邦的冲突，另方面能够防止这个集团同美国贸易区的冲突的话。
    尽管如此，怀特仍然表示十分担心，在“共同市场”集团和英联邦之间以及在这个集团同美元区之间将发生冲突。
    他最后悲观地写道：如果西方“竟然变成了一个分裂和冲突的力量，如果（西方）世界由于在十几个不同的地方发生的贸易战而四分五裂的话，那将是自由世界的一个悲剧”。
