    The Biennial Bearing of Citrus Can Be Changed
    Meng Sheng
    In fruit tree production, the phenomenon of one year yielding a lot and the next year yielding less, alternating between high and low yields, is what people call biennial bearing, or alternate bearing. In the past, this biennial bearing phenomenon was prevalent in citrus production. The yield in the "small year" was often only 50% to 70% of the yield in the "large year."
    Whether the biennial bearing phenomenon in fruit trees can be eliminated has been debated for a long time. There are different opinions regarding the causes of biennial bearing. Some believe it is an inherent characteristic of the fruit tree variety, while others believe it is due to improper cultivation techniques. However, based on what we have seen in our production practices, the common cause of low yields and biennial bearing is not the former, but the latter. As the masses in many citrus-producing areas have concluded after discussions: "There are no low-yielding citrus trees, only low-yielding thoughts and measures."
    The causes of low yields and biennial bearing usually come from two aspects: human and natural. Human factors mainly include extensive cultivation management or improper technical measures, resulting in nutritional imbalance in citrus trees. The limited nutrients are enough to support fruit production, but not enough for branch and leaf growth, making it impossible to have continuous high yields. Especially in the past, citrus production was limited by the economic conditions of individual farmers. Some fruit farmers believed that biennial bearing had become a fixed pattern and that strengthening management would not help, so they simply did not manage the trees in the "small year," which further exacerbated the difference between the "large year" and the "small year." Natural factors include natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, frost, and pests and diseases. However, most natural disasters can be overcome by strengthening prevention. The fact that many citrus-producing areas in our country have had consecutive years of high yields has provided a vivid answer to the question of whether biennial bearing can be changed.
    In 1958, many major citrus-producing areas experienced cases of "small years" surpassing "large years" and "large year" yields doubling. For example, the famous Nanfeng tangerines in Jiangxi Province had a total yield of 2.3 million catties in 1957, exceeding the highest level in history. In 1958, due to strengthened leadership and improved technology, the amount of fertilizer applied increased threefold compared to the previous year. Natural disasters such as frost, pests, and prolonged drought were overcome, and the yield reached 5.2 million catties, an increase of 1.26 times compared to 1957. In Minhou County, Fujian Province, citrus production had historically had significant biennial bearing differences, but in 1958, due to the establishment of a production responsibility system, criticism of conservative thinking, and the promotion of advanced technical experience, the county put forward the slogan "Fight hard for one year to eliminate citrus biennial bearing." Through the efforts of all fruit farmers, they finally achieved a total yield of 260,000 dan, exceeding the 1957 (large year) yield by 3%. In 1958, the yield of tangerines in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, also exceeded the previous "large year" yield by 7.73%.
    There are many similar examples of increased production. These examples of large-scale citrus orchards changing from "small years" to "large years" with universal increases in production eloquently demonstrate that: as long as politics take command, leadership is strengthened, superstitions are eliminated, thinking is liberated, and the subjective initiative of people is fully utilized, and the key measures of water, fertilizer, soil, protection, and management are conscientiously implemented to meet the needs of growth and fruiting, the biennial bearing phenomenon of citrus and other fruit trees can be completely changed.

    柑桔的大小年可以改变
    孟生
    在果树生产中，一年结的多，一年结的少，这种时多时少轮换交替的现象，人们称之为收成上的大小年或叫作隔年结果。过去在柑桔生产中这种大小年现象是普遍存在的，小年产量往往仅及大年产量的50％——70％。
    果树大小年现象能否消灭，争论已久。对于造成大小年的原因，其说不一。有人认为这是果树品种固有的特性，有人认为是栽培技术不当。但是，从我们生产实践中所看到的，造成低产和大小年的普遍原因不是前者，而是后者。正如不少柑桔产区群众在经过辩论以后得出的结论那样：“没有低产的柑桔树，只有低产的思想和措施”。
    造成低产和大小年的原因通常来自人为的和自然的两个方面。人为的因素主要是栽培管理粗放或技术措施失当，以致造成柑桔树的营养失调，有限的养分供得上结果子，就供不上长枝叶，也就不可能连年大量结果。尤其是在过去，柑桔生产受个体农民经济条件的限制，有些果农认为大小年已成为固定规律，加强管理也无法挽救，索性轮到小年就不加管理，这样就更加重了大小年的差别。自然因素包括旱、涝、风、冻和病虫害等自然灾害，但是只要加强御防，大部分自然灾害是可以被战胜的。我国许多柑桔产区连年丰产的事实，已对大小年能否改变的问题作了生动的回答。
    1958年在不少主要柑桔产区都出现了小年超大年、大年产量又加番的事例。如著名的江西南丰蜜桔，1957年总产量达到二百三十万斤，超过了历史上的最高水平。1958年由于加强了领导，改进了技术，单是施肥量就较前一年增加了三倍，战胜了寒霜冰冻、病虫、长期干旱等自然灾害，产量达五百二十万斤，较1957年又增产一点二六倍。福建闽侯县柑桔历年存在大小年差别，但是1958年由于建立了生产责任制，批判了保守思想，推广了先进的技术经验，全县提出“苦战一年，消灭柑桔大小年”的口号，经过全体果农的努力，终于获得总产二十六万担，超过1957年（大年）3％的成绩。浙江黄岩县1958年蜜桔产量也超过前一年大年产量的7.73％。
    类似这样的增产事例还很多。这些大面积柑桔园小年变大年普遍增产的实例，雄辩的说明了：只要政治挂帅，加强领导，破除迷信，解放思想，充分发挥人的主观能动性，认真贯彻水、肥、土、保、管等几大关键措施，满足其生长结果的需要，柑桔以及其他果树的大小年现象是完全能够改变的。
