　　Shenyang City Party Secretary Takes Command, Organizes Collaboration; Guangzhou City Combines Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Relies on Self-Reliance
　　(Our newspaper's report from Shenyang, January 11th) The machinery manufacturing industry of Shenyang City is conducting large-scale collaboration in a planned and rhythmic manner. Despite the lack of materials, equipment, and manpower, it has completed the supporting production tasks of metallurgical, power generation, and other machinery for various parts of the country. As of now, this large industrial city has completed more than two thousand small-flow blowers with a blowing volume of 42.7 cubic meters per minute ahead of schedule for construction units in various places, arming the newly built iron-smelting blast furnaces in various places, and has also manufactured most of the accessories for six 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces ahead of schedule. In terms of completing the supporting tasks for power generation equipment, the supporting work for more than 550,000 kilowatts of generators undertaken by Shenyang City has also made great progress. At present, five 1,500-kilowatt steam turbines, more than 130 water pumps, more than 790 valves, and two air compressors have been completed.
　　Since the third quarter of last year, when the country launched the Great Leap Forward with steel as the key link, Shenyang City has undertaken a large number of supporting tasks for metallurgy, power generation, and steel rolling machinery for various parts of the country. These tasks required urgency in time and large quantities. In order to ensure the completion of this task, the Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee personally took command, unified and organized more than 100 machinery manufacturing and repair factories in the city, forming a strong collaborative network, arranging tasks according to the production conditions of each factory, and jointly undertaking the supporting tasks of various equipment. Under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, a city-wide production command was established, responsible for the inspection and scheduling of production, and assisting various factories in solving difficulties. Under the slogan of "Not a single piece missing, not a single unit less," the workers of all machinery factories in the city devoted themselves to the production battle day and night. Many factories also manufactured indigenous equipment and used methods such as "ants gnawing at bones" to solve the shortage of equipment capacity and actively ensure the completion of machinery supporting tasks.
　　At present, Shenyang City is taking various strong measures to further arrange the supporting manufacturing tasks for steel rolling mills, power generation equipment, and irrigation and drainage equipment in the first quarter of this year. And through the main way of large-scale production collaboration, appropriate arrangements have been made for the supporting varieties, specifications, and models.

    件件设备成套　个个配件齐全
    沈阳市书记挂帅组织协作  广州市土洋结合自力更生
    本报沈阳11日电　沈阳市机械制造业有计划、有节奏地进行大协作，在缺乏材料、设备、人力的情况下，为全国各地完成了冶金、发电等各种机械配套生产任务，截至目前为止，这个大工业城市，已经为各地建设单位提前完成了二千多台鼓风量每分钟可达四十二点七立方公尺的小流量鼓风机，武装了各地新建的炼铁高炉，并且提前制成了六台二百五十五立方公尺高炉的大部分配件。在完成发电设备配套任务方面，沈阳市所担负的五十五万多瓩发电机的配套工作，也有了很大进展，目前已完成了五台一千五百瓩的汽轮机，一百三十多台水泵，七百九十多台阀门和两台空气压缩机。
    自从去年第三季度全国开展以钢为纲工业大跃进以来，沈阳市承担了大批的支援全国各地冶金、发电、轧钢等机械配套任务。这些任务要求时间急、数量大，为了保证这一任务的完成，中共沈阳市委书记亲自挂帅，把全市一百多个机械制造和修配工厂，统一组织起来，形成一个强有力的协作网，按照各厂生产条件安排任务、共同担负起各种设备的配套任务。在市委领导下，并成立了全市性的生产指挥部，负责生产中的检查、调度工作，协助各厂解决困难。全市各机械工厂职工在“一件不缺，一台不少”的口号下，不分昼夜地投入了生产战斗，很多工厂还自己制造了土设备，利用“蚂蚁啃骨头”等办法，解决设备能力的不足，积极保证机械配套任务的完成。
    目前，沈阳市正在采取各项有力措施，进一步安排今年第一季度轧钢机、发电设备和排灌设备配套制造任务。并通过生产大协作的主要途径，对配套的品种、规格、型号都作了适当安排。
