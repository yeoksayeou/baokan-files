    古巴新内阁宣布解散旧国会
    前独裁政权的省市长和议员已被解职
    新华社7日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴新内阁昨日在临时总统乌鲁蒂亚主持下举行了首次内阁会议。
    据报道，内阁会议发表的一项声明宣布解散旧的国会。内阁还下令解散了前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权为镇压古巴爱国者而设立的特别紧急法庭，并且解除了前独裁政权所有省长、市长和议员的职务。上述行政职务将由以后新任命的一些官员来接管。
    消息说，成立了由二十四个委员组成的国家“全国联合”委员会来管理全国的事务。这个委员会的组织成分包括：乌鲁蒂亚总统、属于古巴革命党的内阁总理卡多纳、属于古巴人民党的国务部长兼外交部长罗伯托·阿格拉蒙特、各内阁部长、七个不管部长以及曾经有助于推翻前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的一些革命组织的代表。
    据报道，“全国联合”委员会的其他十二个成员还待于任命。这个委员会曾在5日晚举行会议，宣布了一系列各种职位的任命，其目的在于保证平衡各派别之间的权力。根据总统乌鲁蒂亚发表的一项声明，古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗并没有接受内阁职务。乌鲁蒂亚说，卡斯特罗希望“观察一下局势的发展”。
