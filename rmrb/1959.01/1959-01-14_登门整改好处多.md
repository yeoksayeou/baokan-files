Door-to-Door Rectification Has Many Benefits
Liu Jiangfeng, Secretary of the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Recently, in the socialist education movement in Wanggang People's Commune, Xishui County, Hubei Province, the commune party organization, by boldly mobilizing the masses, launched an unprecedented mass socialist education movement. Forty thousand people in the commune (accounting for 85% of the people who should be mobilized) wrote 50,000 big-character posters, putting forward 120,000 opinions on the commune's distribution, policy handling, people's lives, and cadre style. At the same time, the commune party organization emphasized implementing rectification while correcting, in the spirit of rectification, and promptly adopted various effective measures, such as streamlining the commune and brigade organizations, implementing the "decentralization," "concurrent positions," and "contracting" methods, dividing labor to strengthen leadership over the brigades and production teams, and implementing "four personnel" (commander, combatant, technician, propagandist) and "five togethers" (eat together, live together, work together, study together, and enjoy themselves together) among all cadres and party members. In particular, drawing on the experience of Wangci Brigade, the commune called on all cadres to carry out a movement of "visiting households one by one, door-to-door rectification, answering all questions, and solving every problem," transforming the leadership style, educating and improving the cadres, and strengthening the ties between the party and the masses. This enabled the vast number of grassroots cadres to begin learning a mass line method with universal significance, greatly improving the cadres' thinking.

In the socialist education movement, Wanggang People's Commune fully implemented the mass line method by combining the bold mobilization of the masses with the timely rectification of the leadership's work style, and by combining the masses' big-character posters with the cadres' door-to-door rectification. Moreover, they used the actual actions of rectification to promote the masses' airing of views, and the masses' full airing of views promoted the leadership's thorough rectification. In this way, the more the masses aired their views, the more energetic they became, and the more deeply the movement progressed. At the beginning, commune members posted big-character posters saying, "Airing views, airing views, several times a year, problems not solved, commune members are fooled," and the worry that the socialist education movement would not solve problems quickly changed.

Regarding the shortcomings of cadres' work style, such as not caring about the people's lives and engaging in coercion and commandism, Wanggang People's Commune combined the masses' criticism in big-character posters with their own conscious self-examination and correction, and the leadership's supervision and assistance, so that the masses dared to criticize and the cadres who were criticized were also brave enough to examine themselves and correct their mistakes. The commune party committee and all general branches attached great importance to the opinions in the big-character posters. After the masses began to air their views, the party organization often asked cadres to read the big-character posters and correct any shortcomings they found. For a few cadres with many shortcomings and many opinions from the commune members, the general branch would send the main cadres to carry out mobilization and education, and also go to the masses' homes with the criticized cadres for door-to-door rectification. This both encouraged the masses and educated and improved the cadres. Zhao Yinzong, the secretary of the warehouse militia company of Wanggang Brigade, initially dared not raise his opinions. The general branch secretary immediately expressed a sincere attitude to the masses, demanding that cadres resolutely correct their mistakes. Zhao Yinzong also expressed his welcome to everyone's criticism, and the masses posted Zhao Yinzong's big-character poster: "Zhao Yinzong, also very fierce, you are very strict with the masses, shouting for the masses to engage in double rush, you go to Yu Jiazu to sleep." Zhao Yinzong immediately made a self-criticism, and the masses were very satisfied. Seven hundred and thirty big-character posters were posted in one day. After the problem was solved, the masses' enthusiasm was high, and the commune members actively went to the fields to carry out a surprise attack on production. After such door-to-door visits and face-to-face rectification, many things that the masses had not said for a long time were said. When cadres took the initiative to examine their own shortcomings door-to-door, many commune members also said that they had also been wrong at the time and could not completely blame the cadres. This further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. The masses expressed their gratitude and praised the party's wisdom. Pan Changhe, a commune member of the High Tide Production Team of Wanggang Brigade, originally had a lot of opinions about the coercive commandism of the branch secretary, Ye Qirong. After he posted a big-character poster, Ye Qirong visited his home to express that his past work style was not good and he would resolutely correct it. Pan Changhe later posted another big-character poster: "The great airing of views is really good, the cadres' shortcomings are publicly exposed, now the cadres are really lovely, airing views on one side and correcting mistakes on the other." After this education, Ye Qirong went from having ideological problems in the past to now actively and actively grasping rectification, deeply feeling the supreme glory and pleasure of being an ordinary worker and an ordinary commune member. Through this universal door-to-door visit and face-to-face rectification, not only were the outstanding shortcomings of some cadres resolved, but more importantly, the consciousness of the vast number of cadres was enlightened, the mass viewpoint was strengthened, and the cadres truly became ordinary workers, constantly subject to mass supervision, caring about the people's lives, discussing things with the masses, and openly examining and correcting mistakes to the masses if they did something wrong. In this way, the masses will see the party as being closer than their own parents, and the cadres as being more loved than their own children.

The cadres of Wanggang People's Commune have deeply realized in the short few days of the socialist education movement that cadres changing their work style, going deep into the grassroots, and visiting door-to-door is the best way to make the party's policies directly meet the masses and to quickly deal with various problems. Through door-to-door visits, policies were specifically publicized based on the opinions of the masses, making the movement lively and vigorously. For example, the commune's implementation of distribution and various policy issues was first based on the problems discovered in the cadres' door-to-door visits. Wang Borong, the secretary of the Zhuwa General Branch, found that poor peasant Xiong Shounian did not have cotton clothes during a door-to-door visit, so he raised it to the general branch for study. After asking the commune for instructions, the money was quickly distributed and the difficulty was solved. When a branch secretary of Zhuwa visited door-to-door, he found that Chen Zaotian had opinions about using his purlins and rafters without pricing them. After he reported to the general branch, the general branch investigated and quickly dealt with such problems.

After this period of movement, many cadres have realized that door-to-door visits can not only strengthen the connection between cadres and commune members, but also concentrate the masses' demands at any time and understand the problems that the masses most need to solve. Perhaps a specific problem found in a commune member's family is also a common major problem in the entire commune. The handling of some major problems in this socialist education movement in Wanggang People's Commune was first discovered from a visit to a commune member or a big-character poster. The experience of Wanggang People's Commune proves that not only should leading cadres at all levels learn this working method, but also production team leaders, party group leaders, and party members need to and can fully learn and universally apply this working method.

    登门整改好处多
    中共黄冈地委书记处书记　刘江烽
    湖北浠水县汪岗人民公社最近在整社运动中，由于放手发动了群众，掀起了规模空前的全民性整社运动。全社四万人（占全社应发动面的85％的人）写了大字报五万张，提出了公社在分配、处理政策、群众生活和干部作风等方面的意见十二万条。与此同时，公社党组织强调以整风的精神，贯彻边整边改，及时采取了各种有效措施，如精简公社和大队的机构，实行“下放”“兼职”“包干”三种办法，分工加强对大队和生产队的领导，并在所有干部党员中实行了
  “四员”（指挥员、战斗员、技术员、宣传员）、“五同”
  （同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐）等办法，特别是吸取了王祠大队的经验，号召全社干部开展“逐户访问，登门整改，有问必答，条条解决”的运动，转变了领导作风，教育提高了干部，密切了党与群众的联系，使广大基层干部开始学会了一种具有普遍意义的群众路线的办法，使干部在思想上有很大提高。
    汪岗公社在整社运动中，充分贯彻群众路线的方法是，采取放手发动群众和领导上的及时整顿作风相结合，群众的大字报和干部登门整改相结合，而且以整改的实际行动推动群众的鸣放，群众的充分鸣放又促进了领导上的彻底整改。这样，群众越放越有劲，运动越搞越深入。开始社员贴大字报“鸣放鸣放，一年几趟，问题不改，社员上当”，担心整社不解决问题的情绪很快就转变了。
    对待干部作风上的不关心群众生活和强迫命令等等缺点，汪岗公社的办法是群众的大字报批评，自己的自觉的检查改正和领导的督促帮助结合起来，做到使群众既敢于批评和受批评的干部也勇于检讨改正。公社党委和各总支非常重视大字报的意见，群众鸣放开始后，党组织就经常要求干部看大字报，有缺点就要改。对于少数缺点多社员意见大的干部，总支就派主要干部去进行动员教育，还和被批评的干部一同到群众家里去登门整改，这样，既鼓舞了群众，又教育提高了干部。汪岗大队仓库中队支书赵银中，开始群众有意见不敢提，总支书记当即诚恳的向群众表示态度，要求干部坚决改，赵银中也表示欢迎大家批评，群众才贴了赵银中的大字报：“赵银中，本也狠，你对群众抓得紧，喊叫群众搞双抢，你在余家咀去睡觉。”赵银中马上作了检讨，群众非常满意，一天出了七百三十张大字报，问题解决后，群众情绪高涨，社员们纷纷自动到田里突击生产。经过这样登门访问，当面整改，好多过去群众长期没有说的话都说出来了。当干部登门主动检讨自己缺点的时候，好多社员也表示自己当时也有错，不能完全怪干部，这样，进一步的密切了干群关系，群众都纷纷表示感激和歌颂党的英明。汪岗大队高潮生产队社员潘长和，原来对支书叶启荣的强迫命令意见很大，他贴了大字报后，叶启荣就到他家登门访问，表示过去作风不好要坚决改正。潘长和后来又贴了一张大字报：“大鸣大放真正好，干部缺点公开了，现在干部真可爱，一边放来一边改。”叶启荣经过这次教育，由过去的思想不通到现在自己主动积极的抓整改，深深感到自己作为一个普通劳动者和普通社员无尚的光荣和愉快。通过这次普遍登门访问，当面整改，不仅解决了某些干部的突出缺点，更重要的是启发了广大干部的自觉性，加强了群众观点，真正使干部成为一个普通劳动者，经常受群众监督，关心群众生活，有事和群众商量，做错了公开向群众检讨改正。这样，群众就会把党看成比自己的亲生父母还亲，把干部看成比自己的亲生儿女还要爱。
    汪岗公社的干部们在短短几天整社中已深深体会到：干部转变作风深入下层登门拜访，是使党的政策直接和群众见面，各种问题得到迅速处理的一个最好方法。通过登门访问，根据群众意见，具体地进行了政策宣传，使运动生动活泼地开展起来。比如公社对分配和各种政策问题的贯彻，都是首先根据干部登门访问中发现的问题加以研究而进行的。竹瓦总支书记王伯荣在登门访问中发现贫农熊寿年没有穿棉衣，就提到总支研究，请示公社后，很快分配了钱，就把困难解决了。竹瓦一个分支书记登门访问的时候，发现陈早田对于把他的桁条、桷木用了未作价有意见。他向总支反映后，总支经过调查，将这类问题迅速作了处理。
  经过这段运动，不少干部都体会到，登门访问不仅可以密切干部和社员的联系，而且还可随时集中群众要求，了解群众最需要解决的问题。也许从一家社员所发现的一个具体问题，也正是全公社普遍性的重大问题。汪岗公社这次整社中一些重大问题的处理，首先都是从访问一家社员或一张大字报上所发现的。汪岗公社的经验证明，不仅是各级党的领导干部应当学会这种工作方法，就是生产队长、党的小组长和党员也需要而且完全可以学会和普遍运用的工作方法。（本文原载湖北日报，编者稍加删节）（附图片）
