Editor's Note:

    Spring is coming soon!
    Guangdong, in the south of our motherland, has already begun preparations for spring plowing. Their actions remind everyone: Spring is about to start its advance from the edge of the South China Sea.
    Although most of the northern regions are still covered in ice and snow, it is not too early from the perspective of the solar terms. "Start of Spring" is on February 4th, and it is now only twenty-odd days away from "Start of Spring."
    Winter will soon be over, and every commune should consider: In the winter, when "a year's plan lies in the early winter," what exactly should we do to win an even greater harvest in 1959? What have we already done? What still needs to be done?

    春天就要来到了！
    祖国南方的广东已经开始了春耕准备工作。它们的行动提醒大家：春天就要从南海的边沿迈开前进的步伐了。
    北方大部地区目前虽然还是万里冰封，可是从节气上看也不算早了。二月四日“立春”，现在离“立春”只不过二十多天。
    冬天很快就要过去了，每个公社都应该盘算一下：我们在“一年之计在于前冬”的冬季里，为夺取一九五九年更大丰收到底应该做些什么？已经做了些什么？还要做些什么？
