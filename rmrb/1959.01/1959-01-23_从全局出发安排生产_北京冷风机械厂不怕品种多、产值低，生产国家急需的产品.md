Arranging Production from a Global Perspective
Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory is Not Afraid of Many Varieties and Low Output Value, Producing Products Urgently Needed by the Country

(Our Dispatch) The workers of Beijing Cold Wind Machinery Factory recently held a debate on "Obeying the Overall Interests" in connection with the factory's production direction, and on this basis, comprehensively arranged the production plan for the first quarter according to national needs.

During the Great Leap Forward, the factory completed its plan relatively well, producing a large number of blowers for the steel industry. However, in the later period of last year, it produced some products that were not urgently needed by society. Due to incomplete raw materials, it also accumulated some semi-finished products, while it did not produce enough of some products that had already been contracted with other factories. In the process of studying the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the factory's Party General Branch analyzed the current needs of the country, and according to the instructions of the higher authorities, arranged the production tasks for the first quarter as follows: to quickly assemble the accumulated semi-finished products into complete sets for relevant units to use; to immediately restore the production of small ventilators and combined warm air blowers, which were once suspended last year; to increase some new products that the factory did not produce in the past but were urgently needed by society. In this way, compared with the fourth quarter of last year, although the output value plan for this quarter has been reduced by 33%, the amount of work arranged has been increased by 20%, and the product specifications will be increased by 45%.

When determining this plan, two different opinions appeared in the factory. Some people believed that the varieties and specifications to be produced in the first quarter were too many, too scattered, the output value was low, and production would be troublesome. They believed that more varieties with large output value should be produced, and some scattered products with small output value should be transferred to other factories. Most people disagreed with this opinion. They pointed out that last year the factory did not fulfill the contract and produced a small part of the products, which affected the progress of some user units' projects. Although the varieties planned for the first quarter have a low output value, they are urgently needed by the country. They also used the method of detailed accounting to illustrate that this year's first quarter production plan is a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan. After repeated discussions, the latter understanding was agreed by all the workers, and everyone further realized that to complete this leap forward plan, it is necessary to muster greater efforts to overcome the difficulties of insufficient working hours, equipment, and raw materials.

Based on last year's experience, under the leadership of the Party General Branch, the factory has also formulated specific measures to ensure the completion of this plan.

In order to complete this plan, the workers launched the "Four Goods and One Skill" red flag bearer movement throughout the factory. The "Four Goods" are: good at giving prominence to politics, good at achieving daily production plans, bold but careful and safe, good at caring for the collective and abiding by discipline. The "One Skill" is: use your hands and brains, and be skillful in your work. Everyone is determined to first overfulfill the January production plan through this movement.

Since entering January, the factory has produced more than 100 various small ventilators and combined warm air blowers. In recent days, finished products have been leaving the factory almost every day for installation and use in relevant units.

### 从全局出发安排生产  北京冷风机械厂不怕品种多、产值低，生产国家急需的产品

    从全局出发安排生产
    北京冷风机械厂不怕品种多、产值低，生产国家急需的产品
    本报讯　北京冷风机械厂职工最近结合工厂的生产方向问题，进行了一场关于“服从全局利益”的辩论，并在这个基础上根据国家需要全面安排了第一季度的生产计划。
    在大跃进中，这个厂的计划完成得比较好，为钢铁工业生产了大量的鼓风机，但是在去年的后期，生产了一些社会上不急需的产品，又由于原材料不全，积压了一些半成品，而对于有些已经和其他工厂订了合同的产品则生产不多。工厂党总支在这次学习党的八届六中全会决议的过程中，分析了目前国家的需要，并根据上级的指示，安排了第一季度的生产任务是：把积压的半成品迅速组装成套送有关单位使用；立即恢复去年一度停产的小型通风机和联合暖风机等品种；增加一些本厂过去不生产而社会又急需的新产品。这样，和去年第四季度相比，这个季度产值计划虽然降低33％，但所安排的工作量却提高20％，产品规格将增加45％。
    在确定这个计划的时候，厂里出现了两种不同的见解。一部分人认为一季度要生产的品种规格多，太零星，产值低，生产起来又麻烦。他们认为应该多生产产值大的品种，把一些产值小而又零星的产品转给别的工厂去做。大多数人不同意这种意见。他们指出，去年工厂没有执行合同，少产了一部分产品，结果影响了一些使用单位的工程进一度。第季度计划生产的品种虽然产值低，但是国家急需。他们还用算细账的方法，说明今年第一季度的生产计划，是一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进计划。经过反复讨论，后一种认识得到了全体职工的赞同，大家并进一步认识到要完成这个跃进计划，还必需鼓足更大的干劲，来克服工时、设备不够和原材料不足等困难。
    根据去年的经验，这个厂在党总支的领导下，又制定了保证完成这个计划的具体措施。
    为了完成这个计划，职工们在全厂又开展了“四好一巧”的红旗手运动。四好是：政治挂帅好，日产计划实现好，胆大心细安全好，关心集体遵守纪律好。一巧是：动手动脑，干活论巧。大家决心通过这个运动，首先超额完成1月份生产计划。
    这个工厂在进入1月份以来，已经生产各种小通风机和联合暖风机一百多台，最近几天几乎每天都有成品出厂，送到有关单位安装使用。
