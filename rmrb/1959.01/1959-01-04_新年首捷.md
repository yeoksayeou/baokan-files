	New Year's First Victory
	Xia Yan

	Just stepping into 1959, the Soviet Union sent the first good news to progressive people all over the world: the first giant cosmic rocket in human history to go to the moon is rushing towards the moon. This is a gift from Soviet scientists to the 21st Congress of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it is also a gift from Soviet scientists to progressive people all over the world. The truth that we are getting better day by day while the enemy is rotting day by day has been confirmed not only politically and economically, but also scientifically and technologically.
	Since the Soviet Union successfully launched three artificial Earth satellites, American imperialism, in order to regain political face and reverse its scientific decline, has exhausted all its efforts and made great efforts in rocket and missile science. However, the dying capitalist system is destined to fail in this scientific competition. Just at the end of 1958, the American paper tiger, in order to embolden itself and cheer up its vassal states, launched two intermediate-range missiles in a row. But what was the result? These two missiles only served as firecrackers for New Year's Eve. The "Polaris" missile exploded one and a half minutes after launch, while the "Thor" missile was even more embarrassing, exploding into fragments just a few hundred feet high and scattering on the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Up to now, I have not seen any official statements or explanations from the United States after these two tests, but a joke has spread in the Western world. A cartoonist was worried about not being able to find a subject, and another person said to him, "Don't worry, a missile will be launched at Cape Canaveral tonight."
	Compared with the repeated failures of the United States, the Soviet cosmic rocket is truly "either it doesn't fly, it soars into the sky; either it doesn't crow, it startles everyone with a single cry." This cosmic rocket quickly left the Earth on its first attempt and headed towards the lunar region. Not only did "the last stage of the rocket obtain the necessary second cosmic velocity," but this unfueled last-stage rocket weighed 1,472 kilograms! The TASS communique stated that this experiment was: "The creative labor of the entire Soviet people to solve major problems in the development of socialist society for the benefit of all progressive humanity makes it possible to achieve the first successful interplanetary flight." However, for those outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tigers, what they must first think about is the range and weight of this multi-stage rocket. Calculating this range and weight does not require advanced mathematics, which is the most concrete basis for the warning issued by Marshal Sokolovsky, Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army, on the 25th of last month. It is certain that Eisenhower and Dulles will not sleep well tonight. This is a fierce east wind. Dulles turns around and sees that the "backyard" is a blaze of fire. The east wind is blowing, and the fire in Cuba is burning hotter and hotter.
	There is no time to ridicule, no time to curse. Let us joyfully congratulate the great Soviet Union. The red flag, marked with the Soviet national emblem and the words "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics · January 1959," representing the hearts of progressive humanity all over the world, will soon be displayed in the lunar region. The mysteries of the universe will soon be grasped by mankind. The human fantasy of "going to the moon" for many years will become a reality in the near future.
	Thanks to the great Soviet Union for sending us such great good news at the beginning of 1959. Let us hold high the red flag of communism and advance victoriously!

    新年首捷
    夏衍
    才跨进1959年，苏联就向全世界进步人民发出了第一个喜讯，人类历史上第一支到月球去的巨型宇宙火箭，正在向月球飞奔。这是苏联科学家向伟大的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的献礼，这也是苏联科学家向全世界进步人民的献礼。我们一天天的好起来，敌人一天天的烂下去，这一条真理，不仅在政治上、经济上，而同时在科学技术上也得到了确证。
    自从苏联成功地发射了三颗人造地球卫星之后，美国帝国主义为了挽回政治上的面子和科学上的颓势，曾经使尽了吃奶的气力，在火箭和导弹科学方面进行了很大的努力，可是，垂死的资本主义制度就注定了这一科学竞赛的失败。——就在1958年岁末，美国纸老虎为了给自己壮胆和对他的仆从国家打气，还连续发射了两颗中程导弹。而结果呢，这两颗导弹只不过权充了除夕的爆竹，“北极星”导弹发射一分半钟之后爆炸了，而“雷神”导弹则更加丢丑，刚刚达到几百呎的高度，就炸成碎片，散落在大西洋的海面上了。到现在为止，我还没有看到这两次试验之后的美国官方的谈话和解释，但在西方世界却已经传开了这样一个笑话。一位漫画家正为找不到题材而苦闷，另一个人对他说，别操心，今晚上在卡纳维拉尔角又要发射导弹了。
    和美国的屡试屡败对比起来，苏联的宇宙火箭才真是“不飞则已，一飞冲天，不鸣则已，一鸣惊人。”这一个宇宙火箭一试就迅速地离开了地球，奔向月球区域，不仅“火箭的最后一级已经获得了必要的第二宇宙速度”，而且这个不带燃料的最后一级火箭，计重一千四百七十二公斤！塔斯社发表的公报表明这一试验是：“全苏联人民为了解决社会主义社会发展的重大问题以利于全体进步人类而进行的创造性劳动，使得有可能实现第一次成功的行星际飞行。”可是，对于那些色厉内荏的纸老虎来说，他们首先想到的必然是这种多级火箭的射程和它的重量。算出这个射程和重量不需要高深的数学，这就是苏军总参谋长索科洛夫斯基元帅在上月25日所发出的警告的最具体的根据。可以肯定，今晚上艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯是睡不好觉了，这是一阵猛烈的东风，杜勒斯回过头来看看，“后院”是一片火光，东风在吹，古巴的火越烧越旺了。
    没有时间来嘲笑，没有时间来唾骂，还是让我们兴高采烈地来向伟大的苏联祝贺吧。标志着苏联国徽和“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟·一九五九年一月”字样的红旗，代表着全世界进步人类的心，即将招展在月球区域，宇宙的奥秘很快地就要被人类所掌握，多少年来的人类的幻想——“到月球去”，在不久的将来就将成为现实了。
    感谢伟大的苏联，在1959年岁首就给我们送来了这样一个伟大的喜讯。让我们高举起共产主义的红旗乘胜前进吧！
