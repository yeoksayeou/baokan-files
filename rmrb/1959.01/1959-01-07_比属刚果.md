    Belgian Congo is a region in the African continent with abundant resources and magnificent scenery. The equator crosses its territory, and the Congo River, the second largest river in Africa, nurtures the more than twelve million residents of this land. The area of Belgian Congo is more than 2,343,000 square kilometers, which is 77 times the area of Belgium.
    At the end of the 19th century, the Congo became a colony of Belgium. The Belgian ruling clique carried out cruel exploitation and rule over the Congolese people. From 1885 to the beginning of the 20th century, Belgian colonizers plundered a net profit of 20 million US dollars from the Congo. Before World War II, British and French colonial forces gradually infiltrated Belgian Congo. After the war, the United States used the "Marshall Plan" to massively invade and control most of the minerals in Belgian Congo. In 1954, the United States transported 60% of the cobalt, 64% of the manganese, 79% of the tantalum, 87% of the industrial diamonds, and almost all of the uranium and uranium ore from Belgian Congo. Eisenhower once publicly said: "I really can't understand, what would we do without the Congo?"
    The scale of imperialist plunder is getting larger and larger, while the lives of the people of Belgian Congo are becoming more and more difficult. Some tribes can only eat one meal a day, and sometimes even two days to eat one meal. As a result, diseases are prevalent, physical fitness is weak, and infant mortality is extremely high.
    The people of Belgian Congo, like the people of other countries on the African continent, can no longer endure this life of enslavement and plunder. In recent years, the people of Belgian Congo have carried out extensive struggles, demanding to get rid of colonial rule. The Belgian colonial authorities carried out bloody suppression. In 1956 alone, the number of people imprisoned reached 209,000. However, all this cannot stop the development of the national independence movement in Belgian Congo. Under the influence and support of the national independence movements in various parts of Africa, the people of Belgian Congo, after tortuous struggles, finally forced the Belgian colonial authorities to agree to hold elections in three cities in 1957. Despite the various unreasonable restrictions imposed by the colonial authorities, the forces for national independence still achieved victory in the elections. Kasa-Vubu, chairman of the "Congolese Association Party," was even elected mayor of Dalle in April 1958. In the Leopoldville area, nationalists won many parliamentary seats. Western newspapers had to admit that "the term 'independence' is no longer just whispered among people, it resounds far beyond Leopoldville."
    Since 1958, the economy of Belgian Congo has been greatly affected due to the decline in raw material prices. The production of many copper mines, tin mines and cobalt mines has shrunk, and they are in a state of shutdown and semi-shutdown. The number of unemployed workers has increased rapidly. Many small businesses in the city have also closed down one after another. This situation has caused more people in Belgian Congo to join the torrent of struggle against colonial rule, forming a further upsurge in the national independence movement.

### 比属刚果

    比属刚果
    比属刚果是非洲大陆上一个物产富饶风景壮丽的地区。赤道横贯其境，非洲第二条大河——刚果河哺育着这块土地上的一千二百多万居民。比属刚果的面积有二百三十四万三千多平方公里，等于比利时面积的七十七倍。
    十九世纪末叶，刚果沦为比利时的殖民地。比利时统治集团对刚果人民进行了残酷的剥削和统治。从1885年到二十世纪初，比利时殖民者从刚果掠夺了二千万美元的净利。第二次世界大战以前，英法殖民势力逐渐渗入比属刚果。战后美国利用“马歇尔计划”大举侵入，控制了大部分比属刚果的矿产。在1954年，美国从比属刚果运走了60％的钴、64％的锰，79％的钽，87％的工业钻石以及几乎全部铀矿和铀矿砂。艾森豪威尔曾经公开说过：“我真不能理解，如果没有刚果，我们将怎么办”？
    帝国主义者掠夺规模越来越大，而比属刚果人民的生活则越来越困苦。某些部族的人民每天只能吃一顿，有时甚至两天才能吃一顿。因此，疾病流行，体质虚弱，婴儿死亡率极高。
    比属刚果人民同非洲大陆的其他各国的人民一样，他们不能再忍受这种遭受奴役和掠夺的生活。近年以来比属刚果人民进行了广泛的斗争，要求摆脱殖民统治。比利时殖民当局进行了血腥的镇压，仅1956年一年中，被关进监狱的人数即达二十万九千人之多。但是，这一切并不能阻止比属刚果民族独立运动的发展。在非洲各地民族独立运动的影响和支持下，比属刚果人民经过曲折斗争，终于在1957年迫使比利时殖民当局同意在三个城市进行选举。尽管殖民当局进行了种种无理限制，民族独立力量仍然在选举中取得了胜利。“刚果协会党”主席卡萨—乌布并且在1958年4月当选为达尔市的市长。在利奥波德维尔地区，民族主义者夺得了不少议员席位。西方报纸不得不承认，“独立这个名词已经不只在人们中耳语，它响彻了利奥波德维尔以外很远的地方”。
    1958年以来，由于原料价格下跌，比属刚果经济受到很大影响。许多铜矿、锡矿和钴矿生产萎缩，都处于停工和半停工的状态。失业工人急速增加。许多城市的小企业，也纷纷倒闭。这种情况，使得更多的比属刚果人民投身到反对殖民统治的斗争洪流中来，形成了民族独立运动进一步的高涨。
