How Can a Mere Statement Wash Away the Crime of Interference?
Zhang Ye

The American imperialists, who have always blatantly interfered in Cuba's internal affairs, brazenly issued two statements after the victory of the Cuban people, stubbornly insisting that "the United States' policy towards the Cuban revolution has always been a policy of strict non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs," attempting to wash their blood-stained hands of interference clean with a mere statement. There is no such easy thing. The storm of the Cuban people's opposition to American interference has not been quelled by the American statement; on the contrary, it has risen even higher. This is by no means accidental.

The U.S. State Department statement said that the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba has always acted in accordance with a policy of non-interference, categorically denied that the United States had ever supported the Batista regime, and particularly declared that since March 1958, the United States had neither supplied any weapons to the Batista regime nor transported weapons to the Cuban dictatorial government through third countries. As for the U.S. military mission in Cuba, it had neither "any connection with any military operations to suppress revolutionaries" nor "trained any personnel for this purpose." But the facts are all there; there is no room for denial. The U.S. Ambassador to Cuba executed precisely a policy of interfering in Cuba's internal affairs. Taking the two most recent U.S. Ambassadors to Cuba as examples, Gardner resigned because he gave U.S. tanks to the Batista government, which aroused protests from the Cuban people. Smith, who succeeded Gardner as Ambassador to Cuba, in the words of New York State Democratic Congressman Adam C. Powell, was a man who was "one hundred percent against Castro and had been one hundred percent in support of Batista." None of the scandals of American interference in Cuba's internal affairs during Smith's term was not done through Smith's hands. He once jointly plotted with Batista the so-called presidential election aimed at preserving the dictatorial system. Until the eve of the Cuban rebel army's victory, he also planned to organize a so-called "military commission" in order to prevent the rebel army from gaining power, and finally arranged the escape preparations for the leading figures of the Batista reactionary group. Eisenhower said in a reply announcing his acceptance of Smith's resignation request that Smith was "loyal" in fulfilling the "very difficult" duties he had undertaken. This is not without basis.

It was precisely after March 1958, when it was "obvious that Cuba was undergoing a revolution supported by a large number of people" (U.S. statement), that American interference activities did not diminish, but became even more rampant and more despicable.

On the one hand, the United States supplied weapons to the Batista government through the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. U.S. Black Congressman Powell made a statement in New York on April 5, 1958, criticizing this matter. On the other hand, the United States directly provided support and assistance to Batista's troops through the garrison of its naval base in Cuba. On July 2, 1958, U.S. State Department officials admitted that the United States had handed over 300 rockets to Batista's military aircraft at the Guantanamo Naval Base. "New York Times" reporter Bigart also pointed out in a report that the Guantanamo U.S. Naval Base supplied gasoline to Batista's military aircraft. Order No. 30 issued by the Second Front of the Cuban Rebel Army also pointed out that Batista's air force replenished various types of bombs at the Caimanera U.S. Naval Base.

As for the notorious U.S. military mission, it not only trained Batista's army, but also directly commanded the reactionary government troops in combat. Castro has recently repeatedly criticized the U.S. military mission in public speeches as "a mission trained to defeat our army and possibly engage in espionage activities," and therefore he rightly demanded that the U.S. military mission "pack up and leave Cuba as soon as possible."

What is even more serious is that the United States has never abandoned its military intervention. In July 1958, the U.S. government, under the pretext of protecting the water source of the Guantanamo Naval Base, dispatched Marines to occupy Cuban territory near the base for a time. Only after being strongly opposed by the Cuban people and world opinion did the U.S. troops be forced to withdraw. Later, the United States issued a statement under the pretext of "protecting American property and American citizens," threatening to take measures to deal with the rebel forces, and dispatched fast transport ships to the northeast coast of Cuba under the pretext of evacuating expatriates. What is this about? Is it not obvious?

The crimes of American interference in Cuba's internal affairs are too numerous to count, and have a history of decades. As early as the end of the nineteenth century, when the Cuban people were carrying out a revolutionary struggle to get rid of Spanish colonial rule, and had great hope of achieving final victory, the emerging American imperialism intervened, launched a war against Spain, and thus occupied Cuba in place of Spain. Although U.S. troops withdrew after the establishment of the Cuban Republic in 1902, they forced Cuba to add the so-called "Platt Amendment" to the constitution, which stipulated that the United States enjoyed the right to supervise and interfere in Cuba. In 1903, the United States forced Cuba to sign a enslaving trade agreement and forced the Cuban government to lease naval bases (especially Guantanamo) to the United States.

In August 1906, a widespread popular uprising against American control and enslavement broke out in Cuba, and the United States again sent troops to suppress the uprising, reoccupying Cuba, and only withdrew in 1909 due to the rising Cuban national liberation movement.

In 1912, a black uprising broke out in Cuba, and the United States, under the pretext of "protecting American lives and interests," carried out military intervention in Cuba again. The Cuban uprising of 1917 became an excuse for the United States to send troops to intervene, and U.S. troops did not withdraw until 1922 under the strong opposition of the Cuban people.

Afterwards, the United States adopted the method of plotting coups and supporting puppet regimes to strengthen its political control and economic plunder of Cuba.

During the eight years of Machado's dictatorial regime since 1925, American imperialism gave it its full support. In August 1933, the Cuban people, under the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party, overthrew the Machado dictatorial regime. American Minister Sumner Welles intervened and supported Cespedes, the representative of the bourgeoisie and landlords who opposed the Machado regime, to come to power. A month later, this government was overthrown by the people again, and Grau San Martin was elected as the chairman of the revolutionary government. This was a major victory in the Cuban people's struggle against the American-backed dictatorial regime.

With the support of the powerful people's movement, the San Martin government took some progressive measures. However, soon, American imperialism, which pursued a policy of intervention, colluded with Batista to launch a coup and overthrow the San Martin government. Batista, the running dog of the United States, seized military power and became the de facto dictator of Cuba. In 1940, Batista, relying on American support, was elected president. However, the Cuban people did not stop fighting. In 1944, under the surging revolutionary tide in Cuba, Grau San Martin, the joint presidential candidate of the four parties, including the Cuban People's Socialist Party, was elected, ending Batista's rule.

In March 1952, the United States again instigated Batista, its loyal lackey who had been raised for many years, to launch a military coup and seize power. In November 1954, Batista was again elected president by relying on guns. During the seven years after Batista came to power again, Cuba experienced the darkest period in its history.

Batista provided the most convenient conditions for American imperialism to control and plunder Cuba. American capital poured into Cuba like a tide, with a total investment of more than one billion U.S. dollars, two-thirds of which was invested during Batista's reign. Through huge investments, American monopoly capital obtained astonishingly high profits and controlled the entire economic lifeline of Cuba, firmly placing Cuba under its control. Therefore, in the Cuban people's arduous struggle against the dictatorial regime, American imperialism has been conducting open and shameless interference from beginning to end, doing its best to prevent the Batista dictatorial regime from perishing.

All the above facts cannot be concealed by a U.S. statement. What is significant is that no matter how much blood American imperialism sucked from the Cuban people through interference and aggression, and no matter how it supported and aided the Batista puppet regime, it finally could not stop the course of history and could not stop the victory of the Cuban people. This is the fair judgment of history.

    一纸声明何能洗刷干涉罪名
    章叶
    一贯明目张胆地干涉古巴内政的美帝国主义，公然在古巴人民胜利之后两次发表声明，硬说什么“美国对古巴革命的政策一直是严格的不干涉古巴内政的政策”，妄图靠一纸声明把干涉的血手洗刷得一干二净。哪来这样便宜的事。古巴人民反对美国干涉的风暴，并未被美国一纸声明所遏止，反而掀得更高，这完全不是偶然的。
    美国国务院的声明说，美国驻古巴大使始终遵守不干涉政策行事，矢口否认美国曾经支持过巴蒂斯塔政权，并特别表白从1958年3月以后，美国既没有向巴蒂斯塔政权供应任何武器，也没有通过第三国向古巴独裁政府运送武器。至于美国驻古巴的军事代表团，既“同任何镇压革命分子的军事行动都没有任何联系”，也“没有为此目的训练任何人员”。可是事实俱在，何容抵赖。美国驻古巴的大使执行的恰恰是干涉古巴内政的政策。以美国最近两任驻古巴大使来说，加德纳就是由于把美国的坦克交给巴蒂斯塔政府，引起古巴人民的抗议而辞职的。继加德纳任古巴大使的史密斯，借用美国纽约州民主党人众议员亚当·克·鲍威尔的话，他是“百分之百地反对卡斯特罗和曾经百分之百地支持巴蒂斯塔”的人。美国在史密斯任期内干涉古巴内政的丑事，没有一件不是经过史密斯之手。他曾经同巴蒂斯塔共同策划了目的在于保全独裁制度的所谓总统选举。直到古巴起义军胜利的前夕，他还策划组织所谓“军事委员会”，以便阻止起义军取得政权，最后并且为巴蒂斯塔反动集团的首要分子安排了逃亡准备。艾森豪威尔在宣布接受史密斯辞职请求的复信中说，史密斯在履行他所担负的“非常艰难”的职务时是“忠心耿耿”的。这不是没有根据的。
    正是在1958年3月以后，在“显然看出古巴在进行一次得到大量人民支持的革命的时候”（美国声明），美国的干涉活动不是收敛一些，而是更加猖狂，更加卑鄙。
    美国一方面通过多米尼加共和国和尼加拉瓜给巴蒂斯塔政府供应武器。美国黑人众议员鲍威尔曾在1958年4月5日就这件事情在纽约发表谈话，加以指责。另一方面，美国通过它在古巴的海军基地的驻军，直接给巴蒂斯塔的队伍提供支持和援助。1958年7月2日，美国国务院的官员曾经承认，美国就在关塔那摩海军基地把三百支火箭交给巴蒂斯塔的军用飞机使用。“纽约时报”记者比加特在一篇报道中也指出，关塔那摩美国海军基地把汽油供给巴蒂斯塔的军用飞机。古巴起义军第二战线发出的第三十号命令也指出，巴蒂斯塔的空军在卡伊马内拉美国海军基地补充各种类型的炸弹。
    至于恶行昭著的美国军事代表团，不仅训练过巴蒂斯塔的军队，而且还直接指挥过反动政府军队作战。卡斯特罗最近在几次公开讲话中都指责美国军事代表团是“一个训练用来打败我们的军队的和可能进行间谍活动的使团”，因而他正当地要求美国军事代表团从古巴“卷铺盖，尽快离开”。
    尤有甚者，美国从来没有放弃过它的军事干涉。1958年7月，美国政府曾以保护关塔那摩海军基地的水源为借口，派遣海军陆战队一度占领这个基地附近的古巴领土。只是在遭到古巴人民和全世界舆论的强烈反对后，美国军队才被迫撤离。后来，美国又借口“保护美国财产和美国公民”发表声明，威胁要采取措施来对付起义部队，并在撤退侨民的借口下，派出快速运输舰驶往古巴东北海岸。此为何事，难道还不明显吗？
    美国干涉古巴内政的罪行，罄竹难书，已有几十年的历史。远在十九世纪末，当古巴人民正在进行摆脱西班牙殖民统治的革命斗争，并且大有取得最后胜利的希望时，新兴的美帝国主义就插手进来，对西班牙发动战争，从而代替西班牙占领了古巴。美国军队虽然在1902年古巴共和国成立后撤出，却强使古巴在宪法中加入所谓“普拉特修正案”，这个法案规定美国享有监督和干涉古巴的权利。1903年，美国强迫古巴签订奴役性的贸易协定，并迫使古巴政府把海军基地（特别是关塔那摩）租借给美国。
    1906年8月，古巴爆发了广泛的反对美国控制和奴役的人民起义，美国又派遣军队去镇压起义，重新占领了古巴，到1909年才由于古巴民族解放运动高涨而撤出。
    1912年，古巴发生了黑人起义，美国借口“保护美国人的生命和利益”，又对古巴进行军事干涉。1917年的古巴起义又成了美国出兵干涉的借口，直到1922年美军才在古巴人民的强烈反对下撤出。
    以后，美国采取策划政变扶植傀儡政权的方式，来加强它对古巴的政治控制和经济掠夺。
    在1925年以来马查多独裁政权专政八年期间，美帝国主义曾加以全力支持。1933年8月，古巴人民在古巴共产党领导下推翻了马查多独裁政权。美国公使索麦尔·威尔斯进行干涉，扶植反对马查多政权的资产阶级和地主的代表塞斯披蒂斯上台。一个月以后，这个政府又被人民所推翻，推举格劳·圣马丁为革命政府主席。这是古巴人民反对美国支持下的独裁政权斗争的一次重大胜利。
    在强大的人民运动支持下，圣马丁政府采取了一些进步措施。但是不久，奉行干涉政策的美帝国主义又勾结巴蒂斯塔发动政变，推翻了圣马丁政府。美国的走卒巴蒂斯塔掌握了军权，成为古巴的实际独裁者。1940年，巴蒂斯塔依靠美国的支持当选了总统。但是，古巴人民并没有停止斗争。1944年，在古巴澎湃的革命浪潮下，有古巴人民社会党参加的四个政党的联合总统候选人格劳·圣马丁当选，结束了巴蒂斯塔的统治。
    1952年3月，美国又唆使它豢养多年的忠实走狗巴蒂斯塔发动军事政变，攫取了政权。1954年11月，巴蒂斯塔又依靠枪杆当选总统。在巴蒂斯塔再度上台后的七年期间，古巴经历了历史上最黑暗的时期。
    巴蒂斯塔为美帝国主义控制和掠夺古巴提供了最便利的条件。美国资本像潮水般地涌进古巴，投资总额高达十亿美元以上，其中三分之二是在巴蒂斯塔执政时投入的。美国垄断资本通过庞大的投资，获得惊人的高额利润，并且掌握了整个古巴的经济命脉，把古巴牢牢地置于自己的控制之下。因此，在古巴人民进行反对独裁政权的艰巨斗争中，美帝国主义自始至终都在进行公开的和厚颜无耻的干涉，全力使巴蒂斯塔独裁政权免于复灭。
    以上所有事实，都不是美国一纸声明所能掩盖的。具有意义的是，不管美帝国主义依靠干涉和侵略吮吸了古巴人民多少鲜血，也不管它怎样支持和援助巴蒂斯塔傀儡政权，但它终于不能阻止历史的进程，不能遏止古巴人民的胜利。这是历史的公正裁判。
