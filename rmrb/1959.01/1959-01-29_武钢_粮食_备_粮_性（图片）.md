    Wuhan Iron and Steel "Grain" Prepares "Grain" Nature

    All the workers of the Daye Iron Mine are making great efforts in the new year to strive to mine more ore and achieve an all-round leap forward. Their preliminary plan is to mine 3.02 million tons of raw ore (iron ore) and strip 6.13 million tons this year, while rushing to manufacture thousands of tons of equipment to arm themselves.

    The Daye Tieshan Mountain is rich in mineral deposits and of high grade. After several years of construction, the Dong Open-Pit Mine here has begun to strip and mine in large quantities. This year, it will increase the output of raw ore from 200,000 tons last year to more than 3 million tons, becoming the raw material supply base for the Wuhan Iron and Steel high furnaces.

    武钢“粮食”备“粮”性
    大冶铁矿全体职工在新的一年里，正鼓足干劲，争取多挖矿石，全面跃进。他们初步计划今年开采原矿（铁矿石）三百零二万吨，剥离六百一十三万吨，同时赶制几千吨设备武装自己。
    大冶铁山矿藏丰富，而且品位很高。经过几年建设，这里的东露天矿开始大量剥离和开采了，在今年它将使原矿产量由去年的二十万吨提高到三百多万吨，成为武钢高炉原料的供应基地。
