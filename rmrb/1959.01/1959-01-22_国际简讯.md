    Italian Socialist Party Elects Leading Body
    Rome dispatch: The Central Committee elected at the recently concluded 33rd Congress of the Italian Socialist Party held its first meeting in Naples, electing the party's leading body. At the meeting, Nenni was re-elected as General Secretary. All those elected to the party's leading body were supporters of Nenni.
    At the beginning of the Central Committee meeting, the leader of the Socialist Party's left wing, Vigorelli, suggested electing ten representatives from Nenni's majority faction and five representatives from the minority faction to participate in the party's new leading body, because this would reflect the balance of power within the Central Committee and the party. However, Vigorelli's proposal was rejected by the majority faction representatives.

    Ceylon Publishes 1957 Population Statistics
    Colombo dispatch: The Central Registry's statistical report published here on the 20th states that the estimated population of Ceylon at the end of 1957 was 9,269,000. It is estimated that the country's population increased by 229,000 in 1957, compared to 219,000 in 1956. The report states that the birth rate exceeding the death rate is the sole factor in population increase.

    Burmese Parliament to Hold Meetings
    Rangoon dispatch: Burmese President U Win Maung issued a notification on the 19th, requesting the Burmese Chamber of Deputies to hold a meeting on February 9th, and the Chamber of Nationalities to hold a meeting on February 13th.
    Local journalists believe that the February meeting of Parliament is of great significance. This is because if the general election is held before April this year, Parliament will not be in recess but will be dissolved.

    意社会党选举领导机构
    罗马讯：在最近闭幕的意大利社会党第三十三次代表大会上选出的中央委员会在那不勒斯举行了第一次会议，选举党的领导机构。会上，南尼再次当选为总书记。被选入党的领导机构的，全是南尼的拥护者。
    中央委员会会议开始时，社会党左翼领袖维基耶蒂曾经建议选十名拥护南尼的多数派代表和五名少数派代表参加党的新领导机构，因为这样才能反映中央委员会内和党内的力量对比。但是维基耶蒂的建议遭到了多数派代表的否决。
