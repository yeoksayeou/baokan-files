    (Our dispatch) The main structure project of the second phase expansion of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant has basically achieved both speed and quality, providing construction experience for the simultaneous leap forward in quality and speed. This project, covering an area of more than 9,000 square meters, was undertaken by more than 400 employees of the Fourth Engineering Section of the Beijing Second Construction Engineering Company.
    The first phase of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant reached the conditions for equipment to enter the factory after more than eight months of construction, a speed that was not considered slow in the history of power station construction in China. The workload of the second phase of the project was slightly less than the first phase, but the construction time was much shorter. Except for the metal structure roof truss of the boiler room, which could not be installed and topped off due to the substandard quality after delivery by the collaborating unit, all other main structure projects were completed in only thirty-eight workdays. After inspection by the relevant competent authorities, all projects basically meet the design requirements, and a large number of concrete projects have achieved smooth and flat surfaces, showing significant progress compared to the first phase.
    Under the leadership of the Party organization of the Engineering Section, the entire project was consistently permeated with a vigorous mass movement, while technical management work was done very meticulously and solidly. This is the main reason why the project was both fast and good.
    The second phase of the project began with ideological struggle. The struggle revolved around ensuring and improving project quality while accelerating project progress. Some people neither saw the quality shortcomings in the first phase of the project, nor did they believe that the construction speed could be accelerated. More people felt that the project quality could be better and the construction speed could be faster, but they were unsure how much faster. The Party organization of the Engineering Section used the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and workers to mobilize the masses to decide on the construction plan for the second phase project by summarizing and inspecting the construction of the first phase project. During the discussion, the workers, based on the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, proposed a series of construction measures that could ensure both good and fast project completion. These measures mainly included: absorbing the experience of the Great Leap Forward in the construction industry, changing the construction method of the first phase project, adopting layered cross-parallel flow operations, and maximizing the prefabrication and assembly hoisting rate. For example, they proposed to assemble the entire steel bar formwork, which is eight meters long and six meters wide, including beams and platform panels, underground and hoist it up at once, which would not only speed up the progress but also provide greater assurance for project quality and safety. In addition, the second phase of the project was constructed during the winter. To ensure project quality and smooth construction, they looked up meteorological data for the Beijing area since 1916, found the patterns of general temperature, low temperature, and extreme temperature in November and December, and formulated various corresponding countermeasures. In this way, from the perspective of the overall construction measures, quality can definitely be guaranteed, and progress can definitely be greatly accelerated.
    In order to correctly concentrate the opinions of the workers, the Party organization of the Engineering Section instructed the technicians to propose construction plans separately. Then, using the method of combining three factors, the three schemes proposed by the technical cadres were studied and compared, the advantages were concentrated, and finally a plan that was both advanced and realistic to complete the work in forty days was determined as a draft and issued to the masses for discussion.
    This discussion brought together the wisdom of all employees, and more than 30 suggestions from the masses were adopted, enriching the content of the construction plan. For example, regarding column construction, after accepting the opinions of the masses, the method of adopting a single formwork support of sixteen meters and pouring concrete in two sections was researched. This method not only guarantees project quality but also speeds up the construction progress.
    During the construction process, the Party and administrative leaders of the Engineering Section launched concrete discussions among the workers after each task was issued. The workers discussed very carefully. For example, for the welding of column skeletons by welders, specific arrangements were made for what work would be done on what day, who would do it, and how it would be done. This made the construction compact without chaos, and the progress was fast while ensuring quality. In addition, some weak links in the project were also resolved in the mobilization of the masses.
    Meticulous technical management work is a powerful guarantee for achieving good quality in this phase of the project. The leaders of the Engineering Section fully recognized that revolutionary soaring drive must be combined with meticulous technical management work. Therefore, they took a series of technical measures throughout the construction process.
    First, organize engineering and technical personnel to review the design drawings. After the review, on the one hand, the design requirements were familiarized, and on the other hand, more than fifty design inadequacies or errors were discovered. They actively worked with the client and the design institute to study and modify all of them.
    Second, they stipulated that the main materials must be tested. If the materials do not meet the specifications, they will resolutely not be used; if some have already been used, they would rather rework them.
    Third, in order to avoid errors in operation, a three-level quality inspection system was established for workers, team leaders, and technicians, construction units, and construction units. A combination of mass self-inspection, mutual inspection, and professional inspection agencies was implemented. A major quality inspection was also held every ten days to identify and solve problems at any time.
    Fourth, various professional meetings to ensure project quality were held regularly. In more than one month of construction, the construction unit, the construction unit, and the design unit held sixteen meetings to jointly study measures to ensure project quality.
    While implementing these systems, the construction site also continuously educated workers to attach importance to project quality, put forward the slogan of "A century-long plan, quality first," and made every worker ideologically aware of the importance of comprehensively implementing greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Once, when welders were welding the column skeleton of a beam in the boiler room, there was a deviation of five millimeters. At that time, the construction unit believed that the allowable deviation was one centimeter, which was no problem. However, the workers refused to hand over the work, and as a result, it took five hours to straighten it before it was handed over for acceptance. (Attached photo)

    本报讯　北京热电厂第二期扩建的主体结构工程，基本上做到了既快又好，提供了质量、速度同跃进的施工经验。这个工程有九千多平方公尺面积，是由北京市第二建筑工程公司第四工程处四百多名职工所承建的。
    北京热电厂第一期工程在施工八个多月后达到设备进厂的条件，这个速度在我国电站建设史上是不算慢的。第二期工程的工程量稍少于第一期工程，但是施工时间少得更多。除锅炉间的金属结构屋架因为协作单位交货后质量不合规格，没能安装、结顶以外，其余全部主体结构工程只用了三十八个工作日就建成了。经过各有关主管部门检查，全部工程基本上合乎设计要求，大量混凝土工程做到了光滑平整，比第一期工程有显著的进步。
    在工程处党组织领导下，整个工程始终贯穿着轰轰烈烈的群众运动，同时技术管理工作做得十分细致、扎实。这是工程既快又好的主要原因。
    第二期工程一开始就有思想斗争。斗争是围绕着既要保证和提高工程质量，又要加快工程进度而进行的。有些人既看不到第一期工程中质量上的缺点，又不相信施工速度还能加快。更多的人是觉得能够使工程质量更好一些，施工速度也能够更快一些，但是能快多少，心里没底。工程处党组织就采用领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的方法，发动群众通过总结检查第一期工程的施工，来决定二期工程的施工方案。在讨论中，职工们根据多快好省的建设方针，提出了一系列可以确保工程既好又快的施工措施。这些措施主要是：吸取建筑业大跃进的经验，改变第一期工程的施工方法，采用分层交叉平行流水作业，并且尽量扩大预制组合吊装率。例如，他们提出，把整个长八公尺、宽六公尺，连梁带平台板的钢筋模板在地下组合在一起，一次吊装上去，既可以加快进度，对工程质量和安全也可以更有保证。另外，二期工程施工的时候正是冬季，为了确保工程质量和施工的顺利进行，他们查找了1916年以来北京地区的气象资料，找出了11月份和12月份的一般气温、低气温和极端气温的规律，并且相应地制定了各种对策。这样，从施工总的措施上看，质量肯定可以保证，进度肯定可以大大加快。
    为了把职工群众的意见正确地集中起来，工程处党组织责成技术人员分别提出施工方案。接着又用三结合的方法，对技术干部提出的三个方案进行了研究、比较，集中了优点，最后确定四十天完工的既先进而又实事求是的方案作为草案发交群众展开讨论。
    这一次讨论，集中了全体职工的智慧，群众提出的三十多项建议都被采纳了，使施工方案的内容更加丰富。例如关于柱子施工，在接受群众意见后，就研究出采用一次支模十六公尺、分两段浇灌混凝土的方法。这个方法既保证工程质量，又能加快施工的进度。
    在施工过程中，工程处的党和行政领导在每次下达任务以后，都发动工人具体讨论。工人们讨论得非常细致。像电焊工焊柱子骨架，哪一天作什么活，谁去作，怎么作等等，都作了具体的安排。这就使施工紧凑而不混乱，进度快而又保证质量。此外，工程中的一些薄弱环节，也在发动群众中得到了解决。
    细致的技术管理工作，是这一期工程达到良好质量的有力保证。工程处的领导上充分认识到，革命的冲天干劲必须同细致的技术管理工作相结合。因此，在整个施工过程中，他们采取了一系列的技术措施。
    第一，组织工程技术人员会审设计图纸。经过会审，一方面熟悉了设计要求，同时也发现了五十多项设计不周或者错误的地方。他们积极地同甲方、设计院共同研究，全部作了修改。
    第二，他们规定主要材料一定要经过试验。材料不合规格的，坚决不采用；有的已经用了，也宁可返工。
    第三，为了避免操作中的错误，建立了一套工人、班长和技术员、建设单位和施工单位的三级检查质量制。实行了群众性的自己检查、相互检查和专业检查机构相结合的检查方法。每隔十天还举行一次质量大检查，做到随时发现问题，解决问题。
    第四，定期召开各种保证工程质量的专业会议。在施工的一个多月内，施工单位和建设单位、设计单位召开了十六次会议，共同研究保证工程质量的措施。
    这个工地在实行这些制度时，还不断教育工人重视工程质量，提出“百年大计，质量第一”的口号，使每个工人在思想上都认识到全面贯彻多快好省的重要性。有一次，电焊工在焊锅炉间一栋梁的柱子骨架时，发生五公厘偏差。当时，建设单位认为允许偏差为一公分，没有什么关系。可是，工人们都不肯交工，结果花了五个小时把它调直了才交付验收。（附图片）
