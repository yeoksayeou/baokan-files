Title: On "Accounting"

From some point, people started using the term "accounting." Accounting itself isn't bad; it's a method. Through accounting, we can distinguish right from wrong and find truth. Last year, some "autumn reckoning faction" always wanted to settle accounts with us, but before autumn, the accounts were settled clearly, and they had to admit defeat.

This shows that accounting is a science, depending on how you calculate. Comprehensive and objective accounting can help us improve our understanding, while one-sided and subjective accounting can cause illusions.

Recently, someone calculated several accounts related to the eleven million tons of steel. From the perspective of usage, what can eleven million tons of steel be used for? It can be used to build over 60,000 kilometers of railways, manufacture 110,000 locomotives, produce 110 million double-wheeled double-share plows, manufacture more than 1,660,000 tractors, produce more than 2,410,000 machine tools weighing 4.5 tons each, manufacture more than 300,000 generators with a generating capacity of 10,000 kilowatts, and build more than 16,000 freighters (steel hull) with a load capacity of 1,800 tons.

From the perspective of speed, it took China only one year to increase steel production from 5.35 million tons to 11 million tons. If compared with the past development speed of the steel industry in capitalist countries, the time it took to increase steel production from over 5 million tons to around 11 million tons was seven years for the United States, eight years for Germany, twenty years for Japan, twenty-nine years for France, and thirty-two years for the United Kingdom. Due to the rapid development of China's steel production, we have jumped from 24th in the world in steel production in 1949 to 7th.

As for the production process of the eleven million tons of steel, due to the launch of the mass steelmaking and ironmaking movement, the superstition that steel can only be produced by large factories was broken, people's minds were greatly liberated, tens of millions of steelworkers were trained, and people's thoughts were transformed, which cannot be explained by numbers.

Simply calculating the above accounts helps us to more deeply understand what a great victory the production of eleven million tons of steel is, whether economically, politically, or ideologically. It has a huge impact on the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, and all economic sectors. It eloquently proves that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system, and the training people received in the steelmaking movement will have a profound impact on future work!

This is a major accounting, and this accounting is indeed correct and well done!

What if we use another method of accounting? For example, if we don't calculate the big picture, but only the small picture. Perhaps some people will say: "Although eleven million tons of steel were completed, the indigenous furnaces in the mass steelmaking movement used too much coal. The labor costs were also high." As a result, after calculating back and forth, they might come to the wrong conclusion that "the gains do not outweigh the losses." This is of course completely inconsistent with the facts and becomes a case of focusing on the trivial and forgetting the important. If this is the case, the person doing the accounting will not be able to see the great significance of the eleven million tons of steel.

Of course, we are not against "small accounting." Only calculating the "big picture" without calculating the "small picture" and not seeing the shortcomings in the work will make it impossible to correct the shortcomings in the work. However, if we only calculate the "small picture" without calculating the "big picture," we will lose our direction and cause great mistakes. The accounting of eleven million tons of steel is the same, and the accounting of other tasks is the same. We should "calculate both the big picture and the small picture" and "calculate both the economic picture and the political picture." We should also adhere to the two-point theory in accounting!

### 谈“算账”

    谈“算账”
    卢立人
    不知从什么时候开始，人们有了“算账”这一个词儿。算账本身并不坏，它也是一种方法。通过算账，明辨是非，找出真理。去年有一些“秋后算账派”老想同我们算账，结果不到秋后，账就算得清清楚楚，他们只好认输了。
    由此可见，算账也是一门科学，看你怎么样的算法。算得全面、客观，能够帮助我们提高认识，算得片面、主观，反而会引起错觉。
    最近，有人替一千一百万吨钢算了几笔账。从用途上算，一千一百万吨钢能做些什么呢？可以修筑铁路六万多公里，可以制造火车头十一万个，可以制造双轮双铧犁一亿一千万部，可以制造拖拉机一千六百六十多万台，可以制造体重四吨半的机床二百四十一万多台，可以制造发电能力一万瓩的发电机三十多万台，可以制造载重一千八百吨的货轮（铁壳）一万六千多艘。
    再从速度上算，我国从五百三十五万吨钢增加到一千一百万吨，只经过了一年的时间。如果同资本主义国家过去钢铁工业的发展速度比较，那末，钢产量从五百多万吨到一千一百万吨左右，美国是七年，德国是八年，日本是二十年，法国是二十九年，英国是三十二年。由于我国钢的产量的飞跃发展，现在，我们已从1949年钢产居世界第二十四位而跃居第七位了。
    至于在一千一百万吨钢的生产过程中，由于发动了群众性的炼钢炼铁运动，因而就破除钢铁只能由大工厂生产的迷信，大大地解放了人们的思想，训练了数以千万计的钢铁工人，改造了人们的思想，这就不是用数字可以说明的了。
    简单地算了上面几笔账，它就更深刻地帮助我们认识到：一千一百万吨钢的产量无论是在经济上、在政治上、在思想上，是一个多么伟大的胜利。它对工农业、交通运输业和一切经济部门的发展，有着多么巨大的作用。它雄辩地证明了：社会主义制度比之于资本主义制度，具有无可比拟的优越性，人们在炼钢运动中所得到的锻炼，对今后的工作，将会发生多么深远的影响！
    这是一笔大账，这笔账确实算得对，算得好！
    如果按另外一种算法呢？譬如说不算大账，只算小账。也许有人就会说：“虽然完成了一千一百万吨钢，但在全民炼钢运动中，土炉子用煤多了。劳动力花费也多了。”结果，算来算去，说不定就会得出了“得不偿失”的错误结论。这当然完全不符合事实，变成舍本逐末、算小忘大了。如果这样，算账的人也就看不清一千一百万吨钢的伟大意义了。
    当然，我们也不反对“算小账”。光算“大账”，不算“小账”，看不见工作中的缺点，也就无法改正工作中的缺点。但是，如果我们只算“小账”，不算“大账”，就会迷失方向？造成很大的错误。算一千一百万吨钢的账是如此，算其它工作的账也是如此，我们应该是“既算大账，又算小账”，“既算经济账，也算政治账”，在算账问题上，也应该坚持两点论才对哩！
