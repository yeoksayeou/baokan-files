To ensure the great leap forward in socialist construction, we must always keep up our vigor. This year, the country has already set forth even more ambitious goals than in 1958. Steel production is to increase from about 11 million tons last year to about 18 million tons, coal production is to increase from about 270 million tons to about 380 million tons, and the output of other products will also see corresponding great development. The year's plan starts in the spring, and now each enterprise needs to formulate its own specific goals based on the larger targets. To set advanced targets, we must first of all muster sufficient vigor.

However, mustering vigor is not only reflected in advanced targets, but more importantly in the realization of advanced targets. Unrealized targets, no matter how advanced, are just empty promises. Therefore, after putting forward advanced targets, we must then formulate practical and realistic measures. The measures must be comprehensive and specific, including not only ideological and organizational measures, but also technical measures. When formulating measures, we must fully estimate all possible difficulties: "For ten parts of the target, use twelve parts of measures." Having two extra parts of measures than the target leaves room for maneuver, and the advanced target will have a solid foundation. In this way, we can win every battle and always be invincible.

Therefore, the practice of the Dezhou Machine Tool Factory is good and deserves great promotion.

    劲，时刻都要鼓足
    要保证社会主义建设事业大踏步地前进，干劲时刻都要鼓足。今年国家已经提出了比1958年更宏伟的奋斗目标。钢要从去年的一千一百万吨左右增加到一千八百万吨左右，煤要从二亿七千万吨左右增加到三亿八千万吨左右，其它产品产量也要有相应的大发展。一年之计在于春，现在就需要每个企业根据大的指标订出自己具体的奋斗目标来。而要把指标订得先进，首先就要把干劲鼓得足足的。
    但是鼓足干劲，不只表现在先进指标上面，更重要的是表现在先进指标的实现上面。不兑现的指标，再先进也是一张空头支票。所以，提出了先进指标，跟着就要订出切切实实的措施来。措施要全面，要具体，不只有思想和组织措施，还要有技术措施。订措施要充分估计到一切可能遇到的困难，“十分指标，十二分措施”，措施比指标多二分，留有余地，先进指标就有踏踏实实的基础。这样，就可以百战百胜，永远立于不败之地。
    因此，德州机床厂的做法是好的，值得大大提倡。
