The Dalian Daily reported: The entire staff of the Dalian Steel Plant's main workshop – the First Steelmaking Workshop – continued to exert great effort, and the output, quality, and variety of products for the first half of January were all fully completed, creating a good start for realizing the greater leap forward plan for the whole year.

The First Steelmaking Workshop's production tasks this year are significantly increased compared to last year. The workshop's Party organization considered at the end of last year that to better complete this year's production tasks, employees must maintain strong fighting spirit and create a new leap forward situation from the beginning of the year. On the one hand, combined with studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they explained to employees that with the greater leap forward in national steel production, the production tasks undertaken by the workshop this year would be even more arduous. Only if every employee exerts even greater effort and fires the first shot of the greater leap forward at the beginning of the year can a solid foundation be laid for the greater leap forward of the whole year. On the other hand, combined with the communist education being conducted in the factory, they focused on educating the workers about the theory of continuous revolution and education on organization and discipline. After a period of education, the employees unanimously proposed: "A year's plan starts in spring, production should not slacken at the beginning of the year, and doing a good job in production is the greatest joy of the new year."

While strengthening employee education, this workshop began preparing for this year's production at the end of last year, comprehensively arranged the production for the beginning of this year, overhauled equipment, and prepared raw materials. At the beginning of this year's production, the workshop cadres followed the production shifts day and night, comprehensively focusing on output, quality, variety, and raw material consumption in production, and checking the completion of various indicators on a daily basis. In order to better complete the production tasks, according to the instructions of the factory's Party committee, when mobilizing employees to comprehensively summarize the various experiences of 1958, they emphasized immediate summarization, immediate use, focusing on practical results and instant effectiveness. As a result, in a very short period at the beginning of the year, many advanced experiences in technology, management, and political work from last year have been further promoted.

According to the Lanzhou Daily: The staff of the Lanzhou Third Engineering Bureau's Mechanized Construction Company greeted the construction tasks of 1959 with a fighting spirit, and have now completed January's installation and production tasks twelve days ahead of schedule with an excess of 0.38%.

Since January, this company has been paying attention to both production and daily life, comprehensively arranged the labor organization, formed work groups of office cadres, led by leading cadres, and went down to the grassroots level to focus on production and the lives of employees, promptly helping the grassroots solve problems and launching a mass movement. At the same time, various installation units displayed the spirit of communist collaboration, helping and supporting each other, supplying prefabricated components in advance, and ensuring that installation work was carried out as soon as materials arrived, which greatly promoted the smooth completion of the installation and production tasks.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient building materials, this company produced calcium carbide and welding rods itself. Now, this company is producing these two materials while actively installing mechanized equipment, and is fighting intensely to complete next month's production tasks.

    开年第一炮　生产局面新
    大连钢厂第一炼钢车间上半月全面完成计划
    兰州机械化施工公司提前完成一月份的任务
    据辽宁日报消息　大连钢厂主要车间——第一炼钢车间全体职工继续鼓足干劲，1月份上半月的产量、质量、品种各项指标都全面完成了，为实现全年的更大跃进计划创造了良好的开端。
    第一炼钢车间今年的生产任务比去年有很大的增加，车间党组织在去年年底就考虑到：要使今年的生产任务完成的更好，必须使职工继续保持旺盛的战斗情绪，从年初开始就出现一个新的跃进局面。他们一方面结合学习党的八届六中全会文件，向职工说明了随着全国钢铁生产的更大跃进，今年车间担负的生产任务也将更为繁重，只有每个职工发挥更大的干劲，在年初就打响更大跃进的第一炮，才能给全年的更大跃进打下稳固的基础。另一方面又结合工厂正在进行的共产主义教育，着重进行了不断革命论的教育和组织性、纪律性的教育。经过一段教育之后，职工们一致提出：一年之计在于春，年初生产不松劲，搞好生产是新年的最大快乐。
    这个车间在加强职工教育的同时，从去年年底开始，就抓今年的生产准备工作，全面安排了今年年初的生产，检修了设备，进行了原材料等准备工作。今年的生产一开始，车间干部昼夜跟班生产，在生产中全面地抓产量、抓质量、抓品种、抓原材料消耗，并逐日检查各项指标的完成情况。为了使生产任务完成的更好，他们根据工厂党委的指示，在发动职工全面总结1958年各项经验的时候，强调马上总结，马上就用，着重实效，立竿见影。这样一来在年初的很短一段时间里，去年在技术上、管理上和政治工作上的许多先进经验，都得到了进一步的推广。
    据兰州日报消息　兰州第三工程局机械化施工公司的职工，以战斗的姿态迎接1959年的建设任务，现在已提前十二天超额0.38％完成了1月份的安装生产任务。
    这个公司1月份以来，生产、生活一齐抓，对劳动组织进行了全面安排，将机关干部组成工作组，由领导干部带领，分别下到基层，一面抓生产，一面抓职工生活，及时帮助基层解决问题，大搞群众运动。同时，各安装单位发挥了共产主义协作精神，作到互相帮助，互相支援，提前供给预制构件，安装工作作到随到随安，这便大大促进了安装生产任务的顺利完成。
    这个公司为了解决建筑材料不足的问题，自己生产电石和电焊条。现在这个公司一面生产这两种材料，一面积极安装机械化设备，为完成下月生产任务而紧张战斗着。
