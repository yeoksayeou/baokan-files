Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from New York (TASS, 6th dispatch): The "New York Post" published an open letter signed by Rosario Sanchez, exposing the crimes of American imperialism in supporting the Batista dictatorship in suppressing the Cuban people.

The letter stated, "It is outrageous that the State Department has sent many Castro insurgents who fled to the United States back to Cuba to be executed by Batista's secret police. However, the State Department is extremely solicitous and protective of Batista's henchmen who are now fleeing to the United States without any immigration documents."

The letter cited the example of Cuban Navy Sergeant Miranda, who fled to the United States after the failure of the naval uprising in Cienfuegos. The American authorities, knowing that he was injured and needed prompt medical treatment, and also knowing that if he returned to Cuba, death would be his only fate, did not grant Miranda political asylum. Therefore, Miranda had no choice but to return to Cuba, and there has been no news of him since then.

The open letter concluded by saying that the people of Latin America, "from Mexico to Argentina, have mustered the courage to achieve political and economic independence and freedom for their countries, and they can achieve this goal without American aid. Latin American countries know from past experience that the United States can only help dictators and oppress the people."

The letter specifically pointed out that it is not surprising that Latin American countries are expressing extreme indignation towards the United States, because these countries resent the inequality and oppression they face, and resent the hypocrisy and deception of the United States towards them.

    支持巴蒂斯塔政权　迫害起义军战士
    美国是古巴人民的敌人
    美报发表文章揭发政府罪行
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：“纽约邮报”登载了罗萨里奥·桑切斯署名的一封公开信，揭露美帝国主义支持巴蒂斯塔独裁政权镇压古巴人民的罪行。
    信中说，“令人愤慨的是国务院把流亡到美国的许多卡斯特罗起义分子送回古巴，交给巴蒂斯塔秘密警察处以死刑。但是国务院对现在逃往美国的、没有任何迁移证的巴蒂斯塔独裁者的走狗却百般关怀并给予保护。”
    信中举例说，古巴海军中士米朗达在西恩菲哥斯参加海军起义失败后流亡到美国，美国当局明知他受了伤需要迅速医治，同时也知道，如果他回到古巴，等待他的只有死亡，但是却不给米朗达以政治避难权，于是米朗达只好返回古巴，从那时起就没有任何关于他的消息。
    这封公开信最后说，拉丁美洲的人民，“从墨西哥到阿根廷，都鼓足勇气，要使他们的国家取得政治和经济上的独立自由，他们不要美国的援助也能达到这个目的。拉丁美洲国家根据过去的经验知道，美国只能是帮助独裁者和压迫人民的。”
    信中特别指出，目前拉丁美洲国家对美国表示极其愤慨是不足为奇的，因为这些国家愤恨对它们的不平等和压迫，愤恨美国对它们的伪善和欺骗。
