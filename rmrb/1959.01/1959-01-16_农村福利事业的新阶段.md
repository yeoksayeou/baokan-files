The Collectivization of Life is the Urgent Demand of the Masses

Since the summer of 1958, rural life and welfare undertakings have developed very rapidly. In just a few months, more than 26,000 people's communes have established more than 2 million public canteens, more than 4 million nurseries and kindergartens, and more than 110,000 homes for the elderly. At the same time, welfare undertakings for the blind and deaf-mute, sanatoriums for the mentally ill, sanatoriums (villages) for leprosy patients, sanatoriums for chronically ill demobilized soldiers, and social welfare undertakings such as production and scientific research serving these disabled people have also been newly built and are spreading rapidly throughout the provinces and regions.

The leap forward in rural life and welfare undertakings has emerged in response to the development of productive forces and the establishment of people's communes. After agricultural cooperation, China's agriculture has developed from an individual economy to a collective economy, but the way of life of farmers is still individual. Agricultural production requires high-speed development, and the scattered individual way of life has become an obstacle to the development of production. A large number of female laborers are bound by trivial housework, and a large number of male laborers are also distracted by life problems. This way of life also causes various inconveniences for the unified allocation of labor and the unified organization of political and cultural activities. The people's commune, however, needs a large amount of labor, needs militarized organization and combat-oriented action, and carries out large-scale battles against nature. At the same time, the nationwide rectification movement that began in 1957 further raised the consciousness of the masses, and the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results formulated by the Party in 1958 further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses. The peasant masses also asked to solve the problems of cooking and taking care of children so that they could concentrate all their efforts on participating in this battle. Therefore, as a product of militarization and combat, and as a guarantee of militarization and combat, the collectivization of life—various life and welfare undertakings—has been universally carried out in the vast rural areas of the country. It can be seen that the realization of the collectivization of life and the development of collective life and welfare undertakings are precisely the urgent demands of the broad masses, the inevitable result of the development of productive forces, and the inevitable trend determined by the objective economic law that the relations of production must be suitable to the nature of the productive forces.

Once collective life and welfare undertakings are launched, they will show great positive effects in changing the face of life and the spiritual outlook of China's rural areas: the collectivist and communist ideology of the peasant masses is growing rapidly; hundreds of millions of women who have been bound to the kitchen stove for thousands of years have been liberated to participate in production; the elderly, children, disabled people, etc. have been properly arranged. At present, although China is still a socialist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," people can already see the buds of communism and the future of communism from these life and welfare undertakings, thereby boosting greater enthusiasm and more active labor.

Managing Collective Life Well is a Top Priority

Now that rural collective life and welfare undertakings have been basically established, one of the current important tasks is to concentrate efforts to run them well. Because collective life and welfare undertakings are undertakings that concern the vital interests of hundreds of millions of people and directly affect production, only by running them well can we boost the enthusiasm of the masses more fully and prepare conditions for a greater and better leap forward this year; if they are not run well, they will not only fail to boost the enthusiasm of the masses but will also affect the mood of the masses and hinder the development of production. As early as more than 20 years ago, when we were still in the extremely arduous revolutionary war period, Chairman Mao pointed out: "All practical life problems of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and enthusiastically support us." Our Party has always done this, so every revolutionary task proposed by the Party is "one call, hundreds of responses" and invincible. To run collective life and welfare undertakings well, we must place them firmly under the leadership of the Party and grasp both ideology and specific work. At present, some rural cadres have an unclear understanding of the relationship between production and life, believing that "production is a major event, and life is a minor matter," and even oppose production and life, thus only paying attention to production and not paying attention to life, and relaxing the leadership and management of collective life and welfare undertakings. This kind of ideological understanding is unacceptable. We should strengthen the education of these cadres and repeatedly explain to them: production and life are a unity of opposites. It is certainly wrong to pay attention to improving life unilaterally without first doing a good job in production. Doing so will not only fail to improve production but also fail to improve life, because without the development of production, there can be no improvement in life. However, conversely, if we only pay attention to doing a good job in production and do not pay attention to improving the lives of the masses on the basis of the development of production, it is also wrong. The result of doing so is that life will certainly not be improved, and production will not be improved either. Because if we do not correctly combine the current interests of the masses with their long-term interests, and even some basic requirements of the masses are not appropriately met, it is impossible to constantly boost the enthusiasm of the masses and impossible to give full play to their energy.

At present, there are still many people, including some people engaged in collective life and welfare undertakings, who look down on this kind of work, which is obviously the view of the exploiting classes. The existence of this kind of thinking is a major obstacle to running collective life and welfare undertakings well. Our task is, on the one hand, to vigorously carry out propaganda and education among the masses through airing views and debates, so that everyone recognizes that service work is not only an important part of the entire social work but also directly serves socialist construction, and therefore this kind of work, like any other work, is glorious work, and comrades engaged in this kind of work should be respected by society. On the other hand, we must also use practical actions to break the shackles of this decadent thinking on people. Recently, the Party committees of some places and communes have not only earnestly strengthened the leadership of collective life and welfare undertakings but have also sent a group of cadres down to the communes to work as cooks and childcare workers, including general cadres and responsible cadres. This approach is very good, both as an extremely powerful measure to reverse people's understanding of service work and as a good way to strengthen the specific leadership of the Party committee over collective life and welfare undertakings and to run this aspect of work better.

Both Collective Life and Individual Freedom

Some people still lack a correct understanding of the issue of individual freedom in collective life. Some people one-sidedly believe that after the collectivization of life, individual freedom has decreased; others only pay attention to the collective and ignore that individuals should have a certain degree of freedom. To the former group of people, we must repeatedly make it clear that it is precisely because of the large-scale development of rural life and welfare undertakings that their problems of eating, clothing, children, and the elderly have been properly solved, so that they can concentrate on labor and production with all their heart and energy; especially the vast number of women can be liberated from trivial housework and participate in productive labor and various social activities like men, thus realizing complete equality between men and women not only politically but also economically. In other words, developing and running collective life and welfare undertakings well has not reduced individual freedom; on the contrary, it has given individuals greater and fuller freedom in both production and life. This once again proves that only with collective freedom first will there be individual freedom, and the large collective is the guarantee of small freedom. It should also be made clear to the latter group of people: the collective is also composed of individuals, and the needs and preferences of individuals, even in a communist society, will be different. For example, some people like to eat spicy food, while others cannot eat spicy food; some people like to eat bland food, while others like to eat strong food. The same is true in terms of clothing, cultural entertainment, and so on. No matter how well our collective life and welfare undertakings are run and how thoughtful they are, it is difficult to meet all the requirements of individuals within the large collective. In particular, we must see that although China's productive forces have developed rapidly, the level of production and life is still relatively low, and it is even more difficult to meet the diverse requirements of the masses. So the question arises: will allowing individuals a certain degree of freedom and making it possible to meet the diverse requirements of the masses as much as possible under the premise of first running collective life and welfare undertakings well harm the large collective? We say that not only will it not, but on the contrary, it will further consolidate the large collective. Because with the care of the collective, and with appropriate satisfaction of the needs of the masses, their mood will be more comfortable, and they will be more concerned and love the cause of the collective.

How should we deal with individual freedom in collective life? We believe that the canteen should not only meet the needs of the general commune members but also take care of the elderly, the sick, children, pregnant women, and women in confinement; the meals should be as diversified as possible, economical, nutritious, and clean; the masses should be allowed to add dishes, bring their own side dishes, and keep small stoves. Children can be fully entrusted or day-entrusted, and mothers also have the right to decide whether their children should enter nurseries and kindergartens. Homes for the elderly mainly accommodate the "five guarantees" elderly. The elderly with families but unable to take care of them can enter the homes, or they can enter half of the time (such as entering when family members go out to work and being taken back after returning home; or entering during the day and being taken back at night), or they can not enter the homes. Even whether the "five guarantees" elderly enter the homes is decided by themselves. In short, everything should proceed from facilitating production and facilitating the masses, meeting the diverse needs of the masses, and not simply engaging in it. We must maintain the collective, but the main way to maintain it is to run the collective cause well and to persuade and attract the masses with facts. Some people say that this kind of concern is too detailed. We say that taking care of the details is our responsibility. After the collectivization of life, life problems have changed from family problems to social problems. We must, like a "housekeeper," conduct in-depth and meticulous care and arrangements for people's lives from birth, old age, illness, and death to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, to firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and vegetables, to ensure that the masses can fight for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production without worry, happily, and energetically.

Caring for and Solving the Difficulties in the Lives of a Few People

While running universal collective life and welfare, we must also run social security welfare.

Although the people's communes have implemented a distribution system that combines wages and supplies, it is still "to each according to his work," and, according to the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: "The communes must strive to gradually increase the wages of commune members, and must increase faster than the supply part in several years." In this case, some people who lack labor and people who cannot labor like others due to special physiological reasons will inevitably have less income than others, resulting in a very low standard of living and certain difficulties. How to solve it? Should they work more? No, because they are not trying to gain without working, but for special reasons. We are communists, and we are following the road of common prosperity. We must never forget these people after the lives of the vast majority of people have been arranged and improved. Every family has the possibility of lacking labor, and everyone has the possibility of losing labor due to various objective reasons. If we forget them, it will cause other people to worry about the future. Especially among these people who have difficulties in life due to special reasons, there are some who have contributed to the revolutionary cause, such as the families of martyrs, the families of soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. If we forget them, it will also have an adverse impact on boosting morale and consolidating national defense. Therefore, in order to make people not worry about their future, so that they can selflessly build socialism and defend socialism, we must properly arrange the production and life problems of these people while doing a good job in universal collective life and welfare. The main way to arrange is to create appropriate labor conditions for them and provide necessary life care.

After the people's communes, welfare undertakings for the blind and deaf-mute, sanatoriums for mental illnesses, sanatoriums (villages) for leprosy, sanatoriums for chronic illnesses of demobilized soldiers, etc., are being established more and more in various places. This is the inevitable result of the people's communes. The reason is very simple. In the time of individual life, families take care of these disabled people, which has little impact on production. But after the establishment of the people's commune, the problems of these people stand out. Some of them cannot participate in eating in the public canteens, but they also require life welfare; most people cannot participate in the militarized and combat-oriented ranks, but they also require a great leap forward, to give a share of their energy; and some people, such as patients with mental illnesses, not only cannot participate in production but also occupy a certain amount of labor because they need family care. Facts have proved that solving the problems of these people can add a group of construction forces to society, and it can also increase their income and improve their lives; if it is not solved well, it will affect the development of production more or less.

Organizing labor production that they can do has important significance for many disabled people. The various functions of the human body are interconnected. Damage to one part of the function will hinder the other parts from playing a role. Conversely, strengthening one part of the function will also play a compensatory role for the damaged part. Human organs will atrophy without labor; labor will stimulate its activity, thereby promoting the recovery of the vitality of the damaged part. Therefore, organizing patients with mental illness, leprosy, and chronic diseases to participate in recreational activities and appropriate labor can not only create a certain amount of wealth for society but, more importantly, it can play a therapeutic role in their diseases.

However, the labor arranged for these people must be appropriate, and it must proceed from seeking welfare for them, and we cannot unilaterally emphasize how much wealth they create for society; otherwise, it will not only not play a good role but will further damage their health. This requires placing this work on a scientific basis, assessing their labor capacity, and creating the necessary conditions for their labor. Human labor is composed of two parts: human physiological performance and objective conditions, so disability is not absolute. In this condition, it is a disability, and in a suitable condition, it is not necessarily a disability. Therefore, to develop the welfare undertakings of these people, we must attach importance to the work of creating conditions for them. At present, factories for artificial limbs, factories for hearing aids, and factories for producing special production equipment and tools for the disabled have appeared, and these undertakings need to be developed according to actual needs.

After the people's communes, due to the implementation of a distribution system that combines wages and supplies, the problem of eating has been basically solved, and other problems are not difficult to solve. This is the most important and reliable social insurance. However, because the current stage is still distributed according to labor, a few people who lack labor will still have other difficult problems besides eating. Most people's communes have the strength to solve these difficult problems, but they need to be checked and supervised; a few people's communes do not have enough strength and still need necessary relief and subsidies. At the same time, small disasters will not lead to famine, but large disasters are still difficult to resist. It is wrong to generally talk about relief without seeing the mainstream, and it will also cause problems if you become complacent in the midst of a victory without admitting the secondary stream.

The development of universal collective life and welfare has arranged and improved the lives of the vast majority of the people, and people who have difficulties in life for various reasons have obtained the necessary life security. However, some people, in addition to enjoying collective life welfare, also have their special needs that must be specially arranged and taken care of. Therefore, it is wrong not to regard universal collective life and welfare as the center of welfare undertakings, and it is also wrong to neglect the welfare undertakings of people who need special care while vigorously developing universal collective life and welfare. This requires us to make overall arrangements for these two types of welfare undertakings in our work so that they can both develop vigorously and better serve our socialist construction.

    农村福利事业的新阶段
    王子宜
    生活集体化是群众的迫切要求
    1958年夏季以来，农村的生活福利事业发展得非常迅速。在短短几个月里，两万六千多个人民公社就建立了二百多万个公共食堂，四百多万个托儿所、幼儿园，十一万多个敬老院。与此同时，盲人和聋哑人的福利事业，精神病患者疗养院，麻疯病患者疗养院
  （村），复员军人慢性病患者疗养院，以及为这些残疾者服务的生产、科学研究等社会福利事业，也新建了许多，并且在以很快的速度遍及各个省区。
    农村生活福利事业的跃进局面是适应生产力的发展和人民公社的建立而出现的。农业合作化以后，我国的农业已由个体经济发展为集体经济，但是农民生活的方式仍然是个体的。农业生产需要高速度的发展，分散的个体生活方式成为发展生产的障碍。大量的妇女劳动力被束缚在繁琐的家务劳动之中，大量的男劳动力也为生活问题分散了相当一部分精力。这种生活方式对于统一调配劳动力，统一组织政治文化活动，也造成了种种不便。而人民公社却需要大量劳动力，需要组织军事化，行动战斗化，对自然展开大规模的战斗。同时，1957年开始的全民整风运动进一步提高了群众的觉悟，党在1958年制定的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，更加激发了群众的生产热情。农民群众也纷纷要求解决做饭、带孩子问题，使自己能够集中全力参加这个战斗。因此，作为军事化、战斗化的产物，又作为军事化、战斗化的保证的生活集体化——各种生活福利事业，就在全国广大农村普遍开展起来。由此可见，生活集体化的实现，集体生活福利事业的开展，正是广大群众的迫切要求，是生产力发展的必然结果，是生产关系要适合生产力的性质这一客观经济规律所决定的必然趋势。
    集体生活福利事业一经开展，就在改变我国农村的生活面貌和精神面貌方面表现了极大的积极作用：农民群众的集体主义、共产主义思想正在迅速增长；几千年来被束缚在锅灶旁边的亿万妇女解放出来参加了生产；老人、小孩、残疾者等人得到了适当安排。目前，我国虽然还是“各尽所能，按劳分配”的社会主义社会，但是人们从这些生活福利事业中，已经可以看到共产主义的幼芽，看到共产主义的未来，从而鼓起更大的干劲，更积极地劳动。管好集体生活是当务之急
    农村的集体生活福利事业基本上建立起来了，当前的重要任务之一，就是要集中力量把它办好。因为集体生活福利事业是关系着亿万人民的切身利益的事业，是直接对生产发生影响的事业，只有办好了才能把群众的积极性鼓得更足，为今年更大更好的跃进准备条件；办不好，就不但不能鼓起群众的干劲，而且会影响群众的情绪，妨碍生产的发展。早在二十多年前，当我们还处在极其艰苦的革命战争时期，毛主席就指出：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”我们党从来就是这样做的，所以党提出的每一次革命任务都是“一呼百应”，无往而不胜。要办好集体生活福利事业，就必须把它切实地置于党的领导之下，而且既要抓思想、也要抓具体工作。目前，有些农村干部由于对生产和生活的关系问题认识不清，认为“生产是大事，生活是小节”，甚至把生产和生活对立起来，因而只注意抓生产，不注意抓生活，放松了对集体生活福利事业的领导和管理。这种思想认识是要不得的。应该加强对这些干部的教育，反复地向他们说明：生产和生活是对立的统一，不注意首先搞好生产，只注意片面地改善生活，这当然是错误的。这样作，不但搞不好生产，而且也搞不好生活，因为离开了生产的发展，就不可能有生活的改善。但是，反过来，如果只注意搞好生产，不注意搞好群众的生活，不在生产发展的基础上逐步地改善群众的生活，这也是错误的。这样作的结果，同样是生活固然搞不好，生产也搞不好。因为不把群众的目前利益和长远利益正确地结合起来，甚至群众的一些基本要求也得不到适当的满足，就不可能经常鼓舞群众的积极性，不可能充分发挥他们的干劲。
    目前，还有不少人，包括一些从事集体生活福利事业的人在内，看不起这种工作，这显然是剥削阶级的观点。这种思想的存在，是当前办好集体生活福利事业的一大障碍。我们的任务是，一方面要通过鸣放辩论，大力对群众进行宣传教育，使大家都认识到服务性工作不但是整个社会工作的一个重要组成部分，而且是直接为社会主义建设服务的，因而这种工作和其他任何工作一样，都是光荣的工作，从事这种工作的同志就应受到社会的尊重。另一方面，还要用实际行动来破除这种陈腐思想对人们的束缚。最近，有些地方和公社的党委，不但认真地加强了对集体生活福利事业的领导，而且把一批干部下放到公社当炊事员、保育员，其中有一般干部，也有负责干部。这种作法就很好，既是扭转人们对服务性工作的认识的一项极为有力的措施，又是加强党委对集体生活福利事业的具体领导，把这方面的工作办得更好的好办法。既有集体生活又有个人自由
    对于集体生活中的个人自由问题，也有一些人还缺乏正确的认识。有人片面地认为，生活集体化以后，个人的自由少了；还有人只注意集体，忽视了个人应有一定的自由，对前一种人要反复地向他们说清楚，正是由于农村生活福利事业的大规模兴办，把他们的吃饭问题、穿衣问题、孩子问题、老人问题妥善地解决了，他们才能一心一意地、精力充沛地进行劳动生产；特别是广大的妇女才能从烦琐的家务劳动中解放出来，和男子一样参加生产劳动，参加各种社会活动，从而不但在政治上，而且在经济上实现了彻底的男女平等。这也就是说，兴办和办好集体生活福利事业，不但没有使个人减少自由，恰恰相反，使个人不论在生产和生活方面都获得了更大更充分的自由。这就再次证明了，只有首先有了集体的自由，才会有个人的自由，大集体是小自由的保证。对后一种人也应讲清楚：集体又是由个人组成的，而个人的需要和爱好，就是到了共产主义社会，也是各不相同的。例如，有人喜欢吃辣的，有人就不能吃辣的；有人喜欢吃味道淡的，有人就喜欢吃味道浓的；他如在穿衣、文化娱乐等方面也莫不如此。不管我们的集体生活福利事业办得多么好，设想得多么周到，要在大集体之内满足个人的一切要求，这都是很难作到的。特别是要看到，目前我国的生产力虽然有了迅速的发展，但是生产和生活的水平仍然比较低，要满足群众多方面的要求就更有困难。于是问题就来了：在首先办好集体生活福利事业的前提下，允许个人有一定的自由，使群众的多种多样的要求尽可能得到满足，这会不会损害大集体呢？我们说，不但不会，恰恰相反，会更加巩固大集体。因为在集体的关怀之下，使群众的要求得到适当的满足，他们的心情就会更加舒畅，他们就会更加关心和热爱集体的事业。
    应当怎样来处理集体生活中的个人自由呢？我们认为，食堂要作到不但满足一般社员的需要，而且要照顾老人、病人、小孩、孕妇、产妇；饭菜要尽可能多样化，既节约又富于营养，而且清洁卫生；要允许群众添菜，自带小菜，保留小锅灶。小孩可以全托，也可以日托，母亲还有权决定小孩是否入园入所。敬老院主要是收容“五保”老人，家庭有人但无力照顾的老人可以入院，也可以半入院（如家庭人员出外劳动时入，回家后接回；或者白天入，晚上接回），也可以不入院。就是“五保”老人是否入院，也由他们自己决定。总之，一切要从便利生产和便利群众出发，满足群众多种多样的需要，而不能简单从事。我们要维护集体，但维护的主要办法是办好集体事业，用事实来说服和吸引群众。有人说，这样关心是管得太细了。我们说，管细点是我们应尽的责任。生活集体化以后，生活问题已由家庭问题变成社会问题了。我们必须像“管家婆”那样，从生养死葬到衣食住行，到柴米油盐酱醋菜，对人的生活进行深入的无微不至的关怀和安排，以保证群众无忧无虑地、高高兴兴地、精力充沛地为争取工农业生产的更大跃进而斗争。关心和解决少数人生活上的困难在办好全民性的集体生活福利的同时，还必须办好社会保障性的福利事业。
    人民公社，虽然实行了工资制和供给制结合的分配制度，但是仍然是“按劳分配”，而且，按照党的八届六中全会决议：“公社必须努力使社员所得的工资逐步增加，并且在若干年内必须比供给部分增加得更快。”在这种情况下，有一部分缺乏劳动力的人，因为生理上的特殊原因而不能像别人一样劳动的人，收入必然会比别人少一些，以致生活水平很低，还有某些困难。怎样解决呢？要他们多劳动吗？不行，因为他们不是企图不劳而获，而是有特殊原因。我们是共产主义者，走的是共同富裕的道路，决不能在绝大多数人的生活得到安排和改善以后，忘记了这部分人。每个家庭都有缺乏劳动力的可能，每个人都有因为种种客观原因丧失劳动力的可能，假若遗忘了他们，就会使其他人产生后顾之忧。特别是在这些因为特殊原因而生活困难的人中，有一部分是对革命事业有贡献的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，假若遗忘了他们，还会对鼓舞士气、巩固国防发生不利的影响。因此，为了使人们不为自己的将来担忧，从而忘我地建设社会主义和保卫社会主义，必须在搞好全民性的集体生活福利事业的同时，对这些人的生产和生活问题进行妥善安排。安排的主要办法是为他们创造适当的劳动条件，进行必要的生活照顾。
    人民公社化以后，盲人和聋哑人的福利事业，精神病疗养院，麻疯病疗养院（村），复员军人慢性病疗养院等，愈来愈多地在各地建立起来。这是人民公社化的必然结果。道理很简单，在个体生活的时候，家庭有人照顾这些残疾者，对生产影响不大。但在人民公社建立以后，这些人的问题就突出来了。他们之中有一部分人不能参加公共食堂吃饭，但同样要求生活福利；多数人不能参加军事化、战斗化的行列，但同样要求大跃进，有一分热发一分光；还有一部分人，如精神病患者，不仅不能参加生产，还因为需要家庭看管而占用一定的劳动力。事实证明，把这部分人的问题解决好，可以给社会增加一批建设力量，还可以使他们增加收入，改善生活；假若解决不好，就会或多或少地影响生产的发展。
    组织从事力能胜任的劳动生产，对许多残疾者具有重要的意义。人的机体的各种功能是互相联系的，一部分功能损伤，就会妨碍其他部分发挥作用。反过来，一部分功能的加强，也会对损伤部分发挥代偿作用。人的器官，不劳动就会萎缩；劳动就会刺激它的活动，从而促进损伤部分的生命力的恢复。因此，组织精神病、麻疯病、慢性病患者参加文娱活动和适当的劳动，不仅可以为社会创造一定的财富，更重要的是可以对他们的疾病起治疗作用。
    但是，为这些人安排的劳动必须适当，而且要从为他们谋福利出发，不能片面地强调为社会创造多少财富；否则不仅不会起好作用，反而会更加损害他们的健康。这就需要把这一工作放在科学的基础上，对他们进行劳动能力的鉴定，为他们的劳动创造必要的条件。人的劳动是由人的生理性能和客观条件两个部分组成的，因而残废不是绝对的。在这种条件下是残废，换一个适当的条件就不一定是残废。因此，要开展这些人的福利事业，就必须重视为他们创设条件的工作。现在，假肢工厂、助听器工厂、为残废者生产特种生产设备和工具的工厂等已经出现，还需要根据实际需要发展这些事业。
    人民公社化以后，由于实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，吃饭问题已经基本解决，其他问题也不难解决。这是最重要和最可靠的社会保险。但是，由于现阶段仍然是按劳分配，因而少数缺乏劳动力的人，还会发生吃饭以外的其他困难问题。对于这些困难问题，多数人民公社有力量解决，但需要检查和督促；少数人民公社力量不足，还需要进行必要的救济和补助。同时，小灾已不致成荒，但大灾仍难抗拒。看不到主流而一般地谈救济是不对的，不承认次流而在一片胜利声中变得飘飘然起来也会出问题。
    全民性的集体生活福利事业的开展，安排和改善了绝大多数人民群众的生活，因为种种原因而生活困难的人，获得了必要的生活保障。但是，有一部分人除了享受集体生活福利外，还有他们的特殊需要，必须特殊安排和照顾。因此，不把全民性的集体生活福利事业看作福利事业的重心是不对的，同样在大力开展全民性的集体生活福利事业的同时，忽视需要特殊的人的福利事业也是不对的。这就要求我们在工作中把这两种福利事业作统筹安排，使它们都能够蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，更好地为我们的社会主义建设服务。
