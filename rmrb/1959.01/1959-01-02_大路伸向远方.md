    The Road Stretches into the Distance
    Zhang Pei
    The New Year's bell has just rung, and the heroic socialist builders on China's industrial front have embarked on a new journey. As we advance along the broad road towards the goal of eighteen million tons of steel and the various massive objectives that correspond to it, the voice of history tells people: a great leap forward era has arrived. Like lightning cutting through the sky, China's industry, which lagged behind by a century, is now advancing towards the forefront of the world's industrial nations in just a few years.

    Let us look back at how we have crossed this enormous distance of time.

    The first time China produced qualified steel was in 1907. That year, the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works produced 8,500 tons of steel. Eight years later, in 1915, this factory produced 90,000 tons of steel. This record became its last, because after that, this government-merchant joint venture factory virtually ceased to exist.

    The Chiang Kai-shek group ruled China for twenty-two years, creating many astronomical financial figures, but the steel production figures it controlled remained at the level of the Zhang Zhidong era. That is to say, it did not advance a single step.

    Not just steel, but the entire industry was lagging behind many countries by almost a century. This was the reality of China before 1949.

    The revolution shattered an entire set of reactionary ruling machinery, and people recognized the great power of the revolution. But could the revolution push China, which was a century behind, onto the path of progress? Could the revolution enable us to manufacture machine tools, generators, locomotives, automobiles, tractors, and airplanes in large quantities using our own steel? In 1949, some people were still not convinced of this. Because no one in China's modern history had dared to make such an assumption, let alone actually practice it. For many years, China's geographical concept existed only as a huge market in the East for imperialism. It spat out oceans of wealth every year, while becoming poorer year after year.

    People's eyes were on the Communist Party, to see if we had the ability to change China's fate of poverty. In 1952, we increased steel production to 1.35 million tons, making us enter the ranks of countries producing more than one million tons of steel annually for the first time. We had greatly exceeded the highest annual output of old China, including Northeast China under Japanese rule. People felt that the Communist Party was not only familiar with revolution, but also a builder a hundred times more brilliant than Zhang Zhidong and all the "industrialists" of old China. Five years later, in 1957, we produced 5.35 million tons of steel, a figure that placed us ninth among the world's steel-producing countries. In the same year, people saw cars and jet airplanes made in China.

    Eight years have passed, and the ninth year of our republic—the spring of 1958—has arrived. We are proud that in the past eight years, we have washed away the humiliating stains that imperialism had imprinted on us since 1840. We have taken great strides forward. However, more than five million tons of steel is too little for our large country. We need even greater speed. We need a wider road to leap forward.

    When walking, one must take the main road, but which road is the widest? Which is the fastest? From 1921 to 1949, we walked on the road of revolution for nearly thirty years. We were indeed exceptionally familiar with where the rugged paths were and where the broad avenues were, and along which road the revolution could quickly lead to victory. But we have only walked the road of construction, the road of running industry, and the road of making steel for a few years. We still cannot determine which road is the widest and which road is the easiest to climb to the peak.

    Just as it guided us on the road of struggle during the revolutionary period, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong will always illuminate our path forward like a lighthouse. In 1958, we found a broad road.

    During the First Five-Year Plan, was the speed of increasing steel from 1.35 million tons to 5.35 million tons not fast enough? Yes, it was fast. This is also an unusual speed in the world. It took Britain twenty-four years and the United States sixteen years to complete this journey. But we do not have that much time to use. Because from 1.3 million tons of steel to 5.3 million tons of steel, Britain and the United States both started in 1880 in the nineteenth century, while we started in 1953 in the twentieth century—the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. Our mediocre and ignorant predecessors—the Qing Dynasty emperors, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek Group—created a gap of seventy-three years, making us like a greatly delayed train, we must shorten and eliminate this gap by accelerating our advance.

    History has prescribed such an extremely arduous task for us, and the people place their hopes on the Communist Party. We want to catch up, but is it possible? Speed is not at anyone's disposal, just as a train driver cannot drive the train as fast as they want. We are communists, we neither believe in God nor are we utopian dreamers. However, we have a scientific "magic weapon": the combination of Marxism and Chinese practice. Relying on it, we defeated the ferocious domestic and foreign reactionaries in the revolution. Relying on it, we embarked on the broad road of socialist construction. On this broad road, we have walked for a year, and practice tells us that this is a fast road to victory that achieves more, faster, better, and more economically. The green light is welcoming us. In one year, we have completed the road that it took many years to complete in the past.

    We are already a very experienced traveler. The milestones we see confirm that our direction of running industry is the correct one.

    Hold steel high, and let other industries follow closely. In this way, we not only obtained about 11 million tons of steel, placing us among the top seven steel-producing countries in the world, but also obtained more than 90,000 machine tools, more than 1 million kilowatts of power generation equipment, and about 270 million tons of coal..., their growth rates are all more than double, and they can be included in the forefront of world speed without any shame. All capitalist countries cannot match this even in their golden age in history.

    Central industries and local industries are run together, so we saw a splendid industrial picture emerge on the vast land of the motherland under the leadership of central industries. Patches of virgin land have grown countless industrial seedlings. Towering trees grow from seedlings, and the dawn of industrialized China has risen.

    Around large-scale enterprises that use modern methods of production, let small and medium-sized enterprises that use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods and indigenous production methods thrive at the same time. So we handed over the "mysterious industry" to hundreds of millions of people, changed the timetable of speed, and made it advance further and further. We very much like those large enterprises that use buttons to command machines. We have built such a batch of enterprises, which are the beams and pillars of our industrial building. Such enterprises have already made capitalists in Detroit and Lancashire panic: China is arming itself with advanced technology. But this is not our only advantage. We also understand that walking on two legs is faster than walking on one leg. We are stepping up the construction of the world's first-class large blast furnace with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters, while millions of members of the people's communes are using bricks and clay to build tens of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces with a volume of less than one cubic meter. Earlier, some people in the West ridiculed us, but in the end, they found themselves ridiculing themselves, because indigenous blast furnaces are threatening them, and a 100% growth rate is challenging them. We are dialectical materialists, we understand that backwardness can be transformed into advancement, and small and indigenous things can rise. Modern large enterprises are combined with small indigenous furnaces, always walking on two legs, always organizing the hands and wisdom of hundreds of millions of people into industry, so we will always hold the key to victory, and socialist industrialization will get closer and closer to us.

    When we look at steel, machine tools, generators, locomotives..., we have not forgotten cloth, paper, sugar, and children's toys, let them also go together.

    These are the splendid scenery and infinitely beautiful scenery on our broad road. We have walked for a year and gained rich experience, but this is just another starting point. An even greater leap forward awaits us.

    The road stretches into the distance, we must continue to walk along this broad road, walk on and on. Use fifteen years, twenty years, or a little more time to complete the journey that the largest capitalist countries have completed in more than two hundred years. By then, we can climb to the peak, and capitalism will have to lie helplessly at the foot of the socialist mountain.

    The road stretches into the distance. On this broad road, we not only have our own party as a compass, and hundreds of millions of people advancing with singing, but also the experience of the great Soviet Union, shining brightly in our journey.

    The road stretches into the distance, the great 1959 is beckoning us, we are united and striving forward to new milestones, and new victories are ahead!

    大路伸向远方
    张沛
    新年的钟声刚刚敲过，我国工业战线上的英勇的社会主义建设者，又踏上了新的征途。当我们沿着康庄大道，向着一千八百万吨钢以及和它相适应的各个巨大目标前进的时候，历史的声音告诉人们：一个伟大的跃进的年代来到了。像闪电划破长空，我国的工业在几年中间从落后了一个世纪的悲惨地位正在向着世界工业国的前列挺进。
    让我们回过头来看一看，我们是怎样跨过了这个巨大的时间的距离的。
    我国历史上第一次生产出合格的钢是在1907年。那一年，汉阳钢铁厂生产了八千五百吨钢。经过了八年，也就是1915年，这个工厂生产了九万吨钢，这个纪录成了它的最后纪录，因为从这以后，这个官商合办的工厂实际上就不存在了。
    蒋介石集团统治了中国二十二年，它制造了许多像天文一样的财政数字，可是它所控制的钢的生产的数字，却仍然还停留在张之洞时代。就是说，它一步也没有前进。
    不仅是钢，整个工业，比起许多国家来，差不多落后了一个世纪，这就是1949年以前我国的现实图景。
    革命打碎了一整套反动统治的机器，人们认识了革命的伟大力量。可是革命能够把落后了一百年的中国推向前进的道路吗？革命能够使我们用自己的钢材大批地制造机床、发电机、火车头、汽车、拖拉机和飞机吗？在1949年，有些人还不大相信这一点。因为在我国的近代史上还没有人敢于作过这种设想，更没有人真正地实践过。多少年来，中国在地理上的概念只是作为帝国主义在东方的一个巨大市场而存在着，它每年每年吐出海一样的财富，而它自己则一年比一年贫穷。
    人们的眼睛看着共产党，看我们有没有本领改变中国贫穷的命运。1952年，我们把钢的产量提高到一百三十五万吨。使我们第一次上升到每年产钢一百万吨以上的国家行列。我们已经大大超过了包括日本统治的东北在内的旧中国最高的年产量。人们感觉到了共产党不仅熟谙革命，而且是一个比张之洞和旧中国的一切“实业家”，要高明一百倍的建设者。又过了五年，在1957年，我们生产了五百三十五万吨钢，这个数字使我们进入了世界产钢国的第九位。也就在这一年人们看到了中国制造的汽车和喷气飞机。
    八年过去了，我们共和国的第九年——1958年的春天来到了。我们自豪在过去的八年中，洗去了从1840年以来帝国主义印在我们身上的屈辱的斑痕。我们迈开大步前进了。然而，五百多万吨钢对于我们这个大国是太少太少了，我们需要更高的速度。我们需要一条更宽阔的大道，让我们飞跃前进。
    走路要走大路，可是哪一条路是最宽阔的呢？是能前进得最快呢？从1921年到1949年，在革命的路上，我们走了差不多三十年，我们确实异常熟悉哪里是崎岖的小路，哪里是阳关大道，沿着哪条道路，革命就能迅速地通向胜利。可是建设的路，办工业的路，办钢铁的路，我们只走了几年，我们还不能断定究竟哪一条路最宽阔，哪条路最容易攀上峰顶。
    就像在革命时期指引给我们斗争的道路一样，党和毛泽东同志永远像灯塔一样照耀着我们前进。1958年，我们找到了一条康庄大道。
    在第一个五年计划间，把钢从一百三十五万吨提高到五百三十五万吨，这个速度难道还不够快吗？是的，是快的，在世界上这也是一个不寻常的速度。跑完这段路，英国用了二十四年、美国用了十六年的时间。可是没有这样多的时间供我们使用。因为从一百三十万吨钢达到五百三十万吨钢，英国和美国的起跑点同是在十九世纪的1880年，而我们却是在二十世纪的1953年——第一个五年计划开始的一年。我们的昏庸愚昧的前人——清朝皇帝、北洋军阀、蒋介石集团，给我们造成了七十三年的差距，使得我们像大大误点的列车一样，必须从加速前进中来缩短和消除这个差距。
    历史给我们规定了这样一个极端艰巨的任务，人民把希望寄托给共产党。我们要赶上去，可是能行吗？速度并不是任人随意支配的，就像火车司机不能想把火车开多快就开多快一样。我们是共产主义者，我们既不迷信上帝，也不是个空想家。然而我们有一个科学的“法宝”：马克思主义和中国的实践相结合。依靠它，我们在革命中打败了凶恶的国内外反动派，依靠它，我们踏上了社会主义建设的康庄大道。在这条大道上，我们走了一年，实践告诉我们这是一条多快好省的通向胜利的快速大道。绿灯在迎接我们，在一年中间，我们跑完了过去许多年才能跑完的路。
    我们已经是一个有许多经验的行路人。我们所看到的里程碑肯定我们办工业的方向是一个正确的方向。
    把钢高高举起，让其它的工业都紧紧跟上来。这样我们不仅拿到了一千一百万吨左右的钢，使我们进入了世界产钢国的前七名，而且拿到了九万多台机床、一百多万瓩的发电设备、二亿七千万吨左右的煤……，它们增长的速度都在一倍以上，可以毫无愧色地列入世界速度的前锋。一切资本主义国家在它们历史上的黄金时代也是望尘莫及。
    中央工业和地方工业一齐办起来，于是我们就看到了在中央工业的带领下，在祖国辽阔的疆土上，出现了一幅星光灿烂的工业图景。一片片的处女地，生长出数不清的工业幼苗。参天的大树是从幼苗长成的，工业化的中国已经升起了曙光。
    在大型的用现代化方法生产的企业周围，让中小型的用土洋结合的方法和土法生产的企业同时茁壮生长。于是我们就把“神秘的工业”交给了成亿人民，就改变了速度的时间表，使它提前再提前。我们非常喜欢那些用电钮来指挥机器的大企业，我们建设了这样一批企业，它们是我们工业大厦的大梁和柱石。这样的企业已经使得底特律和兰开夏的资本家大为恐慌：中国正在用先进的技术武装自己。但这并不是我们唯一的优点。我们还懂得两条腿走路比一条腿快得多。我们加紧建设容积为一千五百一十三立方公尺的世界第一流的大高炉，同时千百万人民公社的社员用砖头和粘土在修造成万不到一立方公尺的土高炉。早些时候，西方有人讥笑我们，可是最终他们发现自己讥笑自己，因为土高炉在威胁着他们，百分之百的增长率在向他们挑战。我们是辩证唯物主义者，我们了解落后可以转化为先进，小的土的可以上升。现代化的大企业同小的土的炉子相结合，永远用两条腿走路，永远把千百万群众的双手和智慧组织到工业中来，这样我们就永远掌握着胜利的钥匙，社会主义工业化就越来越向我们靠近。
    当我们把眼睛看着钢铁、机床、发电机、火车头……的时候，我们没有忘记布匹、纸张、食糖和儿童的玩具，让它们也一齐跟着走。
    这些，就是我们这条康庄大道上的绚丽景色，无限好的风光。我们走了一年，取得了丰富的经验，然而这只不过是又一个起点。一个更伟大的跃进在等待着我们。
    大路伸向远方，我们要一直沿着这条康庄大道走下去，走下去。用十五年、二十年或者更多一点的时间，跑完最大的资本主义国家两百多年跑完的路程。到那时我们就可以登上高峰，而资本主义则不得不无可奈何地俯伏在社会主义的山脚下。
    大路伸向远方，在这条大路上，我们不仅有自己的党作指南针，有成亿的人民高歌前进，伟大苏联的经验，也在我们的行程中闪闪发光。
    大路伸向远方，伟大的1959年在向我们招手，我们万众一心向新的里程碑奋勇挺进，新的胜利就在前面！
