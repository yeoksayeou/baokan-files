    Meishan Commune Schedules Time for Female Commune Members
    to Rush-Make New Shoes and Clothes to Welcome the Spring Festival
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th dispatch) The Meishan People's Commune in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, has adopted various methods to ensure that female commune members have ample time to make shoes and clothes, so that commune members can wear new shoes and clothes for the Spring Festival. Each production brigade of the Meishan Commune has established sewing groups, based in the canteens, to make clothes and shoes for the commune members. Since the beginning of winter, the sewing groups have been very busy, as the number of cotton-padded clothes, overcoats, and new clothes made by the commune members has been increasing, especially the shoes with intricate needlework which they don't have enough time to make.
    Chen Liqin, Deputy Secretary of the Meishan Commune Party Committee, learned about the above situation during a visit to female commune members. After discussion by the enlarged meeting of the Commune Party Committee, it was decided to immediately arrange time for female commune members to make shoes and sew clothes, and the following measures were adopted: 1. Female commune members can use their originally scheduled women's holidays and two days of Patriotic Health Campaign to make shoes and sew clothes themselves. 2. Women can make shoes and sew clothes at home on rainy and snowy days. 3. Women do not work night shifts or attend meetings at night. 4. Male commune members will take on the canteen cooking work in the commune on rainy and snowy days so that the female cooks have time to make shoes.
    These measures have now been implemented in all production brigades of the commune. On rainy, snowy days, and holidays, female commune members are happily busy making shoes and sewing clothes. They say: The Communist Party really cares about us women, thinking of everything for us. We will definitely work harder to improve production.

    煤山公社给女社员安排时间
    赶做新鞋新衣迎春节
    本报杭州14日电　浙江省长兴县煤山人民公社采取各种办法，使女社员有充分时间做鞋子做衣服，以便社员们过春节时都能穿上新鞋新衣。煤山公社各生产大队都以食堂为单位成立了缝纫组，给社员们做衣做鞋。入冬以来，由于社员们做棉衣、大衣、新衣的数量越来越多，各缝纫组很繁忙，特别是花工多的鞋子来不及做。
    煤山公社党委副书记陈丽琴在访问女社员中了解到上述情况后，经公社党委扩大会议研究后决定，立即给女社员安排做鞋子和缝衣服的时间，并采取了下面几个办法：一、原来规定的妇女假期和两天爱国日，女社员可以自己做鞋子缝衣服。二、下雨下雪天妇女可以在家里做鞋缝衣。三、妇女晚上不开夜工，不开会。四、公社食堂炊事工作，雨天雪天由男社员担任，以便女炊事人员有时间做鞋子。
    现在这些办法已经在全公社各生产大队开始实行，雨天雪天和假日女社员们高高兴兴地忙着做鞋子、缝衣服，他们说：共产党真关心我们妇女，样样都替我们想得周到，我们一定更加努力搞好生产。
