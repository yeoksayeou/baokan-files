At the beginning of 1959, simultaneously with the new high tide of the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle, an anti-colonialist roar also erupted on the banks of the Congo River, the "oasis of stability" on the African continent. Another volcano has erupted on the African continent. The Congolese people, whom the Belgian colonialists had boasted of treating with "humanitarianism," have now risen up against the "benevolent fathers" riding on their heads. Leopoldville has issued a magnificent call: "Long live the independence of the Congo!" "Belgians, go back to Europe!" The blood of Congolese patriotic martyrs will not be shed in vain; it has become a torrent, impacting the entire Congo and the entire Africa.

News from Africa in these days indicates that Africa is in upheaval. Riots have occurred in French Togoland and Portuguese Angola; Africans in Nyasaland in the British colony of the Central African Federation have held demonstrations; the people of Southern Rhodesia have held anti-colonialist rallies, protesting the repressive actions of the British colonial authorities and demanding the dissolution of the Central African Federation; Northern Rhodesian African leader Sikapalo told more than a thousand Africans attending the rally: "The British must leave immediately!" In East Africa, the Buganda Council passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the enslaving agreement signed between Buganda and Britain, and the cancellation of British protection over Buganda; Uganda National Congress Party Chairman Kiwanuka said: "The people of Uganda are greatly encouraged by what is happening in the Congo." At the same time, in Mauritania, Chad, and Cameroon, the people are engaged in armed struggles against colonialism. The entire African continent, from the Cape of Good Hope to Algiers, from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean coast, has been swept up in a storm of national liberation movements. The "Dark Continent" is dawning, and the torch of freedom is burning throughout Africa.

It is in this context that the Belgian colonial government has carried out a frenzied suppression and massacre of the unarmed Congolese people. In these short days, the Belgian colonial army has killed hundreds of Congolese Africans, wounded hundreds more, and arrested nearly a thousand people, including three leaders of the Congolese national movement and the African district chief of Leopoldville. The colonial authorities have also declared martial law in the capital of the Congo, sealed up the trade union publication "Our Rights," and searched the office of the "African Conscience" periodical. Terror hangs over Leopoldville. The Belgian colonialists vainly attempt to quell the Congolese people's anger with bayonets, bullets, machine guns, and armored vehicles, but the "benevolent father"-like colonialists have already learned that machine guns and armored vehicles cannot intimidate or subdue the Congolese people. Therefore, they have once again resorted to cunning deception. The Belgian government was forced to issue a statement indicating that Belgium intends to make the Congo a "democratic state capable of exercising sovereignty and deciding its own independence," and expressed its intention to implement some kind of "Congo reform plan." However, the statement did not mention the date of Congo's independence or the specific steps to achieve independence. It is quite obvious that this is a despicable conspiracy by the Belgian colonialists, attempting to use this empty lie of "independence" to paralyze the Congolese people's fighting spirit in order to buy time to intensify the brutal suppression and terroristic rule over the Congolese people.

However, as the African proverb says: "Lies are like driftwood, sooner or later they will be washed ashore by the sea," the Belgian colonialists' despicable tricks cannot deceive the Congolese people. Because the Belgian colonial government cannot answer the following questions: since it intends to grant the Congo independence, why massacre the Congolese people and bloody Leopoldville; why has it not yet released the leaders of the Congolese national independence movement and the Congolese patriots; why are arrests, persecutions, and searches still being carried out? On one side are empty promises of "independence," and on the other side is the living reality of bloody suppression, which can only further expose the hypocritical and sinister face of the colonialists. It is also noted that the deceptive conspiracy played by the Belgian government has been applauded by the new colonialists across the Atlantic. The "New York Herald Tribune" described Belgium as an "enlightened colonizer"; the "New York Times" said that the Belgian government's statement showed the "prospect of complete independence" for the Congo, and so on. This can only expose the ugly face of American colonialism itself.

The Congolese people have spent eighty years of blood and tears under Belgian colonial rule. As Kasavubu, the leader of the Congolese "Abako" organization, said, "Only when we gain independence can there be democracy in the Congo." The Belgian colonialists once proclaimed that they had prepared a "paradise for black Africans" in the Congo. Now the Belgian government is still solemnly dispatching some kind of "investigation team" and the Minister for Congolese Affairs to "investigate" the "causes" of the Congo riots, as if the outbreak of people's struggle in "paradise" is a very accidental thing. However, there is no need for these gentlemen's "investigation" at all. Every Congolese African will tell you what kind of "paradise" the Western colonialists have prepared for Africans. In this "paradise," over eighty years, the Congolese population has decreased from 30 million to 13 million; the daily wage of a local worker can only buy a pack of matches; malaria, hookworm fever, and septic pneumonia are terrifyingly taking the lives of the Congolese people, and the infant mortality rate has reached 50%; nearly one million Africans are imprisoned and exiled in the colonial detention camps, suffering cruel tortures... Now the Congolese people have risen up to fight to destroy this inhumane "paradise," to break the shackles imposed on them by the colonialists, and to build their own true paradise. In the past ten years, the Congolese people have never stopped their struggle against colonialism. From 1945 to 1947, popular uprisings occurred many times in the Congo; from 1949 to 1950, Congolese miners launched a movement to fight for political rights and raise wages; in 1953, peasants in the eastern and equatorial provinces of the Congo launched demonstrations to resist unbearable taxes and the barbaric behavior of the Belgian colonial authorities. These facts prove that the Congolese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and freedom cannot be strangled by the colonialists.

Naturally, the Congolese people's struggle for independence and freedom will still have to go through a difficult road. However, the history of all anti-colonialist struggles proves that the seemingly powerful colonialists are actually decadent and fragile. The strength of the revolutionary people, even if it may suffer temporary setbacks, will inevitably grow stronger with the development of the struggle. As long as they maintain their vigorous revolutionary spirit and the close unity of all patriotic forces, and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to finally defeat colonialism, win independence, and win freedom.

The Congolese people's struggle for national independence is not isolated. It is part of the national liberation movement of the entire African continent, and also part of the struggle of the people of the world for peace, democracy, and progress. The national liberation struggle of the Congolese people and the African people has received the deep sympathy and support of the entire socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, the Asian countries, and all progressive mankind. We Chinese people, who have won victory after a long and cruel struggle against imperialism, therefore have a deep affection for the Congolese people and the African people who are still waging a heroic struggle under imperialist oppression. We firmly support the just struggle of the Congolese people, angrily condemn the Belgian colonial authorities' barbaric suppression and massacre of the Congolese people, demand that the Belgian authorities immediately release the leader of the "Abako" association and all the fighters who have been arrested for fighting for independence, and demand the immediate recognition of Congo's independence. The Chinese people also firmly believe that the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Congolese people and the heroic African people!

### 胜利一定属于刚果人民和非洲人民

    胜利一定属于刚果人民和非洲人民
    在1959年伊始，和古巴人民革命斗争新高涨的同时，在大西洋对岸的非洲刚果河岸的“安定的绿洲”也发生了反殖民主义的怒吼。非洲大陆上又一座火山爆发了。比利时殖民者曾经自吹自擂地说被他们“人道主义”地那样对待的刚果人，现在起来反对骑在他们头上的“慈父”了。利奥波德维尔发出了“刚果独立万岁！”“比利时人滚回欧洲去！”的雄壮呼声！刚果爱国烈士的热血，是不会白流的，它已经成为一股激流，冲击着整个刚果，冲击着整个非洲。
    这几天来自非洲的消息表明，非洲在震动着。法属多哥和葡属安哥拉发生了暴动；英国殖民地中非联邦的尼亚萨兰的非洲人举行了示威，南罗得西亚人民举行了反殖民主义集会，抗议英国殖民当局的镇压行动，要求解散中非联邦，北罗得西亚非洲人领袖西帕洛向参加集会的一千多名非洲人说：“英国人必须马上走开！”在东非，布干达议会通过一项决议要求废除布干达同英国签订的奴役协定，取消英国对布干达的保护权；乌干达国民大会党主席基瓦努卡说：“乌干达人民由于目前在刚果发生的事情而感到极大的鼓舞。”与此同时，在毛里塔尼亚、乍得、喀麦隆，人民正在进行着反抗殖民主义的武装斗争。整个的非洲大陆，从好望角到阿尔及尔，从大西洋沿岸到印度洋沿岸都卷起了民族解放运动的风暴。“黑暗大陆”正在破晓，自由的火炬在整个的非洲燃烧起来了。
  正是在这种情况下，比利时殖民政府对手无寸铁的刚果人民进行了疯狂的镇压和屠杀。在短短的这些天内，比利时殖民军杀害了几百个刚果的非洲人，打伤了好几百，又逮捕了近千人，其中包括三个刚果民族运动的领袖和利奥波德维尔市非洲人区长。殖民当局还在刚果首府宣布了戒严令，查封了工会刊物“我们的权利”，搜查了“非洲良心”期刊的办事处。恐怖笼罩着利奥波德维尔。比利时殖民者妄想用刺刀、枪弹、机关枪和装甲车来平息刚果人民的怒火，但是，“慈父”般的殖民者，已经懂得，机关枪和装甲车吓不退，也压服不了刚果人民。于是，他们就又玩弄起狡诈的欺骗。比利时政府被迫发表声明表示比利时打算让刚果成为一个“能够行使主权和决定自己的独立的民主国家”，并表示要实现什么“刚果改革方案”。但是声明丝毫也没有提及刚果独立的日期和实现独立的具体步骤。十分明显，这是比利时殖民者的一项卑劣的阴谋，它企图用这种空洞的“独立”谎言来麻痹刚果人民的斗志，以便争取时间，对刚果人民加紧残暴镇压和恐怖统治。
    但是，正如非洲的谚语所说：“谎话犹如浮木，早晚要被海水冲上海岸”，比利时殖民者的卑劣伎俩是欺骗不了刚果人民的。因为，比利时殖民政府回答不了这样的问题：既然打算让刚果独立，为什么要屠杀刚果人民，血洗利奥波德维尔；为什么至今还不释放刚果民族独立运动的领袖和刚果的爱国者；为什么还在进行逮捕、迫害和搜查？一面是空洞的“独立”诺言，一面却是血腥镇压的活生生的现实，这只能进一步暴露殖民者的虚伪阴险的面目。人们还注意到，比利时政府玩弄的这一套欺骗阴谋，得到了大西洋彼岸的新殖民主义者的喝彩，“纽约先驱论坛报”把比利时说成是“开明的殖民者”；“纽约时报”说比利时政府的声明展示出刚果“完全独立的前景”，等等。这也只能暴露美国殖民主义者自己的丑恶面目。
    刚果人民在比利时殖民统治下度过了八十年的血泪生活。正如刚果“阿巴科”组织的领袖卡萨武布所说的，“只有在我们获得独立的情况下，刚果才能有民主。”比利时殖民者曾宣扬他们为刚果人准备了一座“非洲黑人的乐园”，现在比利时政府还一本正经地派出什么“调查团”和刚果事务大臣去“调查”刚果暴动的“原因”，似乎在“乐园”里爆发人民斗争是非常偶然的事情。但是，根本不需要有劳这些先生们的“调查”，每一个刚果的非洲人都会告诉你，西方殖民者为非洲人准备的是怎样的一个“乐园”。在这个“乐园”里，八十年来刚果人口从三千万减少到了一千三百万；一个本地工人的每日工资只能购买一包火柴；疟疾、蛔虫热以及败血性肺炎，可怕地夺取着刚果人的生命，婴儿的死亡率达到了50％；将近一百万非洲人被监禁和流放在殖民者的拘留营中，受着残酷的苦刑……现在刚果人民起来斗争就是要摧毁这一座惨无人道的“乐园”，打碎殖民者强加在他们身上的枷锁，以建立他们自己的真正的乐园。最近十多年以来，刚果人民一直没有停止过反抗殖民主义的斗争。1945年到1947年，刚果多次发生过人民起义运动；1949年到1950年，刚果矿工展开了争取政治权利和提高工资的运动；1953年，刚果的东部和赤道各省农民发动示威，反抗难以忍受的赋税和比利时殖民当局的野蛮行为。这些事实证明，刚果人民争取独立、民主和自由的斗争是殖民者所扼杀不了的。
    自然，刚果人民为独立、自由的斗争还要经历艰苦的道路。但是，一切反殖民主义斗争的历史证明，貌似强大的殖民主义者实际上是腐朽的、脆弱的。革命人民的力量纵使可能遭到一时的挫折，但是必将随着斗争的发展而日益壮大，只要保持自己旺盛的革命斗志和一切爱国力量的紧密团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够最后战胜殖民主义，赢得独立，赢得自由。
    刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争，不是孤立的。它是整个非洲大陆的民族解放运动的一部分，也是全世界人民争取和平、民主和进步的斗争的一部分。刚果人民和非洲人民的民族解放斗争，得到了以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营、亚洲国家和全体进步人类的深切同情和支持。我们中国人民，是在同帝国主义进行了长期残酷的斗争之后取得胜利的，因之，对于还在帝国主义压迫之下进行英勇斗争的刚果人民和非洲人民怀着深厚的感情，我们坚决支持刚果人民的正义斗争，愤怒地谴责比利时殖民当局对刚果人民的野蛮镇压和屠杀，要求比利时当局立即释放“阿巴科”协会的领袖和一切被捕的为独立而斗争的战士，要求立即承认刚果的独立。中国人民也完全相信，最后的胜利一定属于英勇的刚果人民，属于英勇的非洲人民！
