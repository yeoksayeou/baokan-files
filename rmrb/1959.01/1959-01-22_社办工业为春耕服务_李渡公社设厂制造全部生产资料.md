Commune-Run Industry Serves Spring Plowing

Lidu Commune Establishes Factories to Manufacture All Means of Production

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 21st dispatch) The Lidu People's Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, is vigorously running factories to prepare a large amount of production materials for the large-scale spring plowing production campaign. According to the 1959 leap forward plan, the Lidu Commune Party Committee carefully analyzed and calculated the production materials needed for spring plowing, and found that the required quantity was more than double that of 1958, and the variety increased by more than ten kinds. For example, more than 6 million jin of native fertilizer and more than 4,000 plowshares are needed this year, both of which have increased more than threefold compared to last year. The required deep plows, rice transplanters and other new-style agricultural tools reached three or four hundred.

According to the opinions of the commune members, the Commune Party Committee formulated an industrial plan to develop services for spring plowing production, and took the following measures to solve the difficulties of insufficient funds, equipment and technology. First, starting with improving and expanding the old factories, more than a dozen small, scattered factories were merged; at the same time, in the spirit of spending less money and doing more things, the principle of taking local materials, local manufacturing, local processing, and making use of simple conditions was adopted to build factories, in order to reduce transportation and materials used for factory construction, and save funds. Second, concentrate the handicraft technicians of the whole commune to be masters, and organize the commune members to learn production technology. Third, two Party Committee secretaries were assigned to specialize in industry to strengthen the leadership of the factories. In addition, the factories established a production responsibility system to ensure the completion of production tasks.

After the implementation of the above measures, Lidu Commune newly built and expanded sixty-three factories for agricultural tool repair and assembly, native fertilizer, lime, cement, raincoats, bamboo hats, straw sandals, etc. After the agricultural tool repair and assembly plant successfully trial-produced rope-drawn plows, rice transplanters and other seventeen kinds of new agricultural tools, they have now been put into mass production. The daily output of the expanded native fertilizer plant has increased from eight tons in the past to thirty-eight tons, and more than 3,000 tons of native fertilizer have been produced so far. It is estimated that before the spring plowing, the various production materials produced by the factories can completely meet the needs of the commune's spring plowing. At that time, the average mu of land in the whole commune can be applied with 1,000 jin of native fertilizer, which is three times more than last year. All paddy fields can be cultivated with new-style agricultural tools such as rope-drawn plows and rice transplanters. Each commune member has a raincoat and a bamboo hat for rain protection, as well as five pairs of straw sandals and two sweat towels.

    社办工业为春耕服务
    李渡公社设厂制造全部生产资料
    本报南昌21日电　江西省临川县李渡人民公社大办工厂，为大规模的春耕生产运动准备了大量生产资料。李渡公社党委按照1959年跃进计划，仔细分析和计算了春耕需要的生产资料，发现需要的数量比1958年多了一倍多，品种增加了十多种。如今年需要六百多万斤土化肥，四千多个犁头，都比去年增加了三倍以上。需要的深耕犁、插秧机等新式农具达三、四百部。
    公社党委根据社员的意见，制订了发展为春耕生产服务的工业方案，并采取了如下的措施，解决了资金、设备、技术等不足的困难。一、从提高和扩大老厂入手，将原来十多个小的、分散的工厂合并；同时本着少花钱、多办事的精神，采取就地取材、就地制造、就地加工、因陋就简的原则建厂，以减少运输和建厂所用材料，节约资金。二、集中全社手工业技术人员做师傅，组织社员学习生产技术。三、抽出二名党委书记专门抓工业，加强对工厂的领导。此外，各厂建立了生产责任制，保证了生产任务的完成。
    上述措施实行之后，李渡公社新建和扩建了农具修配、土化肥、石灰、水泥、蓑衣、斗笠、草鞋等六十三个工厂。农具修配厂试制成功绳索牵引犁、插秧机及其他新式农具十七种后，现在都已投入了成批生产。扩建后的土化肥厂日产量已由过去的八吨上升到了三十八吨，至今已生产土化肥三千多吨。预计到春耕前，各个工厂所生产的各种生产资料，能完全满足本公社春耕的需要。那时，全社平均每亩田可以施一千斤土化肥，比去年增加三倍。所有稻田都能用绳索牵引犁、插秧机等新式农具进行耕作。每个社员有一件避雨的蓑衣和一个斗笠，另外还有五双草鞋和二条汗巾。
