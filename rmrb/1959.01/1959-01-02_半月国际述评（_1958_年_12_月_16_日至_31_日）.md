Semi-Monthly International Review
(December 16 to 31, 1958)

The giant of history has crossed the great year of 1958 with breathtaking steps. This year has left people with a clear and profound impression: the moribund imperialist world is rotting day by day, and the youthful and wonderful socialist world is getting better day by day. The comparison between the advantages and disadvantages of the two worlds is becoming increasingly strong. Especially in the last half month of this year, many facts have deepened people's impression of "the east wind prevails over the west wind."

A bright and colorful spring scene

At the end of 1958, from Moscow to Beijing, from Tirana to Pyongyang, from Hanoi to Berlin, the entire socialist family was full of bright spring scenery.

Good news of various countries completing their 1958 production and construction plans ahead of schedule has been pouring in, with hundreds of millions of working people bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new year with new labor achievements. They first achieved great victories on the industrial front. The Soviet Union's key industrial sectors have completed their plans ahead of schedule, and the total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 10% compared to 1957. Steel production increased to nearly 55 million tons. Compared with the United States' steel production, it has increased from 48% of the United States' production in 1957 to 65.5% of the United States' production. The Soviet Union's coal production has left the United States behind and now ranks first in the world. The world's largest hydroelectric power station, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, also began generating electricity a year ahead of schedule before the new year. In the last moment of the Great Leap Forward year, the Chinese people doubled their steel production after doubling their grain production. In this year, an average of about two large factories and mines in our country were partially or fully put into production every day. In 1958, other socialist countries also made significant leaps in industrial production: Albania increased by 20%, Hungary increased by 13%, Vietnam increased by more than 40%, North Korea increased by 37%, the German Democratic Republic increased by 10.7%, Poland increased by 9.5% in the first eleven months of last year compared with the same period of the previous year, Romania increased by more than 9.5%, Czechoslovakia's industrial production growth rate reached the highest level in six years, and Bulgaria also completed its industrial production plan ahead of schedule. On the agricultural production front, countries such as the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Vietnam all achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in 1958. China's wheat and cotton production both exceeded that of the United States. In 1958, socialist countries leaped forward rapidly, achieving great victories in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries.

The socialist countries are good this year, and they will be even better next year. The further we look ahead, the more beautiful its scenery will be.

The Soviet Union greeted the New Year amidst the enthusiastic national discussion of the Seven-Year Plan. The Seven-Year Plan is the Soviet Union's magnificent plan for building communism, and its realization will lay a solid material and spiritual foundation for the Soviet Union's transition to communism. After the Seven-Year Plan is realized, in about five more years, that is, by 1970, the Soviet Union will catch up with or surpass the United States and rank first in the world in terms of both the absolute amount of production and the output per capita. By that time, the Soviet people will live the best life in the world. Further improving agriculture is one of the most important tasks for the Soviet Union to build communism. Before the New Year, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted an important resolution on Comrade Khrushchev's report on agricultural issues, summarizing the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in developing agriculture in the past five years, and stipulating the task of further increasing agricultural product output in the next seven years. 1959 is the first year for the Soviet Union to realize the Seven-Year Plan. The Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by 7.7% compared to 1958, and the agricultural output value will also increase significantly. Immediately following the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Second Session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the 1959 Soviet state budget law. This budget is a budget for peace. It uses a large amount of funding for national economic and cultural construction to ensure the victorious completion of the production and construction tasks for the first year of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. 1959 is a year of continued Great Leap Forward for our country. Our country's steel production will increase to about 18 million tons, coal production will increase to about 380 million tons, grain production will increase to about 1,050 billion catties, and cotton production will increase to about 100 million dan. Other socialist countries are also continuing to advance on the basis of their victories in 1958. Czechoslovakia and Romania have approved or are discussing the 1959 budget. Czechoslovakia's total industrial output in 1959 will increase by 9.3% compared to 1958. These new figures are figures of great significance, marking that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will be more prosperous in 1959, and marking that socialist countries will spur their horses to overtake a new section of the road in the peaceful economic competition with the capitalist world.

Frequent peals of peace bells at the end of the year

At the end of 1958, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union also made new and significant efforts to safeguard world peace and ease international tensions.

The peaceful efforts of socialist countries are first manifested in promoting the early signing of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests and the resolution of the Berlin issue. As we all know, the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapons Tests held in Geneva has not yet achieved substantial results due to the obstruction of the United States and the United Kingdom. The Western countries have also not shown sincerity in negotiations at another Geneva conference – the Conference on the Prevention of Surprise Attacks. In addition, Western countries, especially the United States, are trying every means to find excuses in an attempt to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw foreign troops from Berlin and end the Berlin occupation. At the same time, the North Atlantic Council meeting in December 1958 proved that the Western countries are still clinging to West Berlin and trying to maintain the state of occupation in West Berlin, making West Berlin a bridgehead for the North Atlantic Group to undermine European peace and the peaceful construction of the German Democratic Republic. The acts of the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to delay the signing of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests and obstruct the resolution of the Berlin issue are unanimously opposed by the people of socialist countries and all peace-loving people.

On December 21, the Chinese government issued a statement fully supporting the Soviet government's proposal to withdraw foreign troops from Berlin and end the Berlin occupation; and believing that the poisonous tumor of West Berlin, which poisons the situation in Europe and the world, must be removed, and the United States, Britain, and France have no reason to reject this reasonable Soviet proposal. On the same day, the government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement opposing the North Atlantic Group's interference in German affairs and not allowing the North Atlantic Group to become the protector of West Berlin. On December 23, TASS issued a statement condemning the North Atlantic Council meeting for evading the Soviet Union's peace proposals and obstructing the resolution of European security issues and the German issue. On December 25, the Second Session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a resolution approving the Soviet government's policy on the issue of the cessation of nuclear weapons tests and on the Berlin issue. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko pointed out at the meeting that the Soviet Union is willing to sign an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests with the United States and the United Kingdom at any time; and pointed out that holding reasonable negotiations between the directly relevant countries is the most correct way to resolve the Berlin issue.

In addition, the Executive Committee meeting of the World Peace Council held in Helsinki from December 19 to 20 issued a statement calling on the world's peace forces to make persistent efforts to force foreign troops to withdraw from Germany, South Korea, and Taiwan, the territory of China. On December 26, Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, suggesting that the two sides hold a meeting recently to discuss and reach agreements on several important issues of Vietnam's reunification; and requesting the South Vietnamese authorities to change their policy of adhering to American imperialism, and reiterating that the issue of Vietnam's reunification does not allow any foreign interference.

All of these once again embody the peaceful aspirations of the people of all socialist countries and all peace-loving people.

Looking at 1958 from the end of the year, this year is a year of unprecedented leaps and unprecedented prosperity for socialist countries, and it is also a year in which they have made continuous and significant contributions to the cause of peace. The infinite fullness of youth and vitality of socialism, and the peaceful policies of socialist countries, encourage the people of all socialist countries and all progressive humanity to tirelessly struggle for world peace and the bright future of mankind.

The setting sun in the west, full of dangers

Looking back at the imperialist camp. The events that occurred in the last half month of 1958 are a vivid portrayal of the imperialist camp increasingly moving towards disintegration.

The North Atlantic Council meeting held from December 16 to 18 exposed the deepening and complexity of internal contradictions within the imperialist camp. First, the leadership of the United States was severely challenged by its "allies": France demanded the establishment of a "three-giant core" of the United States, Britain, and France; West Germany, Italy, Canada, and the Nordic countries demanded the strengthening of "political consultation"; and Britain put forward Marshal Montgomery, who was in opposition, to advocate that a European replace the American general as the Supreme Commander of the "Allied Forces." Secondly, Britain, France, and West Germany launched a white-hot struggle over the issue of the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area" in order to compete for hegemony in Western Europe and the position of the second "ally." In addition, there were also contradictions between Britain, Greece, and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, contradictions between Britain and Iceland on the Icelandic territorial waters issue, and contradictions between West Germany and the Nordic countries on the command of Nordic troops, etc.

During the three-day meeting, although Dulles shouted himself hoarse about the seriousness of the "communist threat" and the necessity of "Western unity," imperialism ultimately followed the "maxim" of the late British Prime Minister Palmerston that "we have no permanent allies, our interests are permanent." Therefore, the final communiqué of the meeting, in addition to clamoring on the Berlin issue, could not put forward any solutions to all existing contradictions.

The facts are ruthless. The economic contradictions between the Western European countries, which the communiqué tried its best to conceal, openly broke out in the form of a currency war in less than ten days. On December 27, in order to improve the competitiveness of export commodities and enter the "Common Market" position established on January 1 this year, France fired on British commodities, announcing the devaluation of the franc and the implementation of limited free convertibility. At the same time, Britain announced the expansion of the free convertibility of the pound in order to improve the competitiveness of British commodities and resist the "Common Market." Also on the same day, other Western European countries followed suit and took similar measures to Britain. The "European Payments Union," which had been established for eight years and had been touted as a symbol of "economic cooperation," was thus declared collapsed.

This currency war, which was mainly launched by Britain and France, marks that these countries have had to take desperate measures in order to get rid of the imminent economic crisis. As we all know, the consequences of currency devaluation will inevitably be a comprehensive rise in domestic prices, inflation, and increased taxes, which cannot but further reduce people's purchasing power, thereby deepening the economic crisis. The implementation of free convertibility in the case of insufficient gold reserves will inevitably lead to currency devaluation and all its malignant consequences.

The United States, which has long been mired in an economic crisis, is struggling to break free. Eisenhower's statement on the new US budget released on December 22 is a concrete manifestation of this struggle. In the past year, the US government attempted to stimulate the economy and get rid of the crisis of "excess" production by substantially increasing expenditures. As a result, the crisis of "excess" production is still serious, and massive expenditures have caused a serious financial crisis and inflation. Therefore, Eisenhower's new budget intends to save the financial crisis and curb inflation by tightening expenditures and increasing income. The so-called tightening of expenditures is merely to cut civilian expenditures in areas such as agriculture, unemployment relief, and housing construction, while military expenditures have increased significantly; the so-called increase in income is to directly plunder ordinary people, such as raising postal rates and gasoline taxes. Regardless of whether this method can curb inflation, it is certain that the further reduction of people's purchasing power and the further shrinkage of civilian industries will deepen and develop the crisis of "excess" production.

Contradictions, splits, crises, struggles – the imperialist camp bid farewell to the old year in such a miserable way, and stumbled into the new year!

Of course, the countries of the imperialist camp are still strengthening the "Cold War" and actively engaging in arms expansion and war preparations. They vainly attempt to use the "Cold War" and arms expansion and war preparations to ease internal contradictions and economic crises.

However, the facts of the past year have proved that the "Cold War" and arms expansion and war preparations can only promote the resolute opposition of the people of all countries and deepen the internal contradictions and economic crises of the imperialist camp. Any conspiracy activities carried out by imperialism against nationalist countries also ended in failure. When celebrating the great achievements of the past year and joyfully welcoming the New Year, the people of all countries will pay close attention to all war activities of imperialism with high vigilance, strengthen their fighting spirit, defend peace, and make 1959 a year in which socialism and the world's peace forces achieve greater victories and imperialism suffers greater defeats.

    半月国际述评
    （1958年12月16日至31日）
    历史巨人以惊心动魄的步伐跨过了伟大的1958年。这一年给人们留下鲜明而深刻的印象：风烛残年的帝国主义世界一天天地烂下去，青春美妙的社会主义世界一天天地好起来。两个世界优胜劣败形势的对比越来越强烈了。特别是在这岁末的半个月中，许多事实更加深了人们对“东风疾劲西风衰”的印象。
    春光灿烂万紫千红
    1958年岁尾，从莫斯科到北京，从地拉那到平壤，从河内到柏林，整个社会主义大家庭一片春光灿烂，万紫千红。
    各国提前完成1958年生产建设计划的捷报纷纷传来，亿万劳动人民以新的劳动成就辞旧岁，迎新年。他们首先在工业战线上取得了巨大的胜利。苏联重要工业部门已提前完成计划，1958年工业总产值比1957年增长10％。钢产量增加到将近五千五百万吨，它同美国钢产量比较，已由1957年占美国的48％增长到占美国的65.5％。苏联煤产量已把美国抛在后面而跃居世界第一位。世界上最大的水电站——斯大林格勒水电站也在年前提前一年开始发电了。我国人民在大跃进年的最后时刻，又继粮食翻一番之后，把钢产量翻了一番。这一年中，在我国平均每天都约有两个大厂矿部分或全部地投入生产。1958年，其他社会主义国家工业生产也都有显著的跃进：阿尔巴尼亚增加了20％，匈牙利增加了13％，越南增加了40％以上，朝鲜增加了37％，德意志民主共和国增加了10.7％，波兰去年头十一个月中比前年同期增加了9.5％，罗马尼亚增加了9.5％以上，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产增长速度达到六年来的最高水平，保加利亚也提前完成了工业生产计划。在农业生产战线上，1958年苏联、中国、朝鲜、越南等国家都获得了空前的大丰收。我国的小麦和棉花的产量都超过了美国。1958年，社会主义国家飞速跃进，在同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中取得了巨大的胜利。
    社会主义国家今年好，明年更好，越向前看它的景色越美丽。
    苏联在全民热烈讨论七年计划声中迎接了新年。七年计划是苏联建设共产主义的宏伟计划，它的实现将为苏联向共产主义过渡奠定坚固的物质和精神基础。在七年计划实现以后，大约再过五年，即到1970年，苏联无论在生产的绝对数量方面，或者是在按人口平均计算的产量方面，都将赶上或超过美国而居世界第一位，到那时候，苏联人民将过着世界上最美好的生活。进一步提高农业是苏联建设共产主义的最重大的任务之一。年前苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议就赫鲁晓夫同志关于农业问题的报告通过重要的决议，总结了最近五年来苏联发展农业的巨大成就，并且规定了今后七年中进一步增加农产品产量的任务。1959年是苏联实现七年计划的第一年，苏联的工业总产值将比1958年增加7.7％，农业产值也将大大增加。紧接着苏共中央全会召开的第五届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议，通过了1959年苏联国家预算法。这个预算是和平的预算。它以大量的拨款用于国民经济和文化的建设上，以保证胜利完成苏联七年计划第一年的生产建设任务。1959年是我国继续大跃进的一年，我国的钢产量将增加到一千八百万吨左右，煤产量将增加到三亿八千万吨左右，粮食产量将增加到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花产量将增加到一亿担左右。其他社会主义国家也在1958年胜利的基础上继续前进。捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚已经批准或正在讨论1959年的预算，捷克斯洛伐克1959年的工业总产量将比1958年增加9.3％。这些新的数目字是具有重大意义的数目字，标志着1959年以苏联为首的社会主义阵营将更加繁荣，标志着社会主义各国在同资本主义世界的和平经济竞赛中，快马加鞭再赶过一段新的路程。
    岁尾频传和平钟声
    1958年尾，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营也为维护世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势作了新的重大的努力。
    社会主义国家的和平努力，首先表现在促使早日签订停止核试验的协定和解决柏林问题上。大家知道，在日内瓦举行的不继续试验核武器会议上，由于美国和英国的阻挠，至今还没有取得实质上的成就。而西方国家在另一个日内瓦会议——防止突然袭击会议上，也没有表现出谈判的诚意。另外，西方国家，特别是美国，正在千方百计地寻找借口，企图拒绝苏联关于从柏林撤退外国军队，结束柏林占领状态的建议。同时，北大西洋集团理事会1958年12月会议证明，西方国家仍然死抱着西柏林不放，力图使西柏林的占领状态继续保持下去，使西柏林成为北大西洋集团破坏欧洲和平和民主德国和平建设的桥头堡。以美国为首的帝国主义集团拖延签订停止核武器试验协定和阻挠解决柏林问题的行为，是社会主义各国人民和一切爱好和平的人民所一致反对的。
    12月21日，我国政府发表声明，完全支持苏联政府关于从柏林撤退外国军队和结束柏林占领状态的建议；并且认为，毒化欧洲和世界局势的西柏林这个毒瘤必须割除，美、英、法没有理由拒绝苏联这个合情合理的建议。同一天，民主德国政府发表声明，反对北大西洋集团干涉德国事务，不允许北大西洋集团成为西柏林的保护人。23日，苏联塔斯社发表声明，谴责北大西洋集团理事会会议回避苏联的和平建议，阻挠欧洲安全问题和德国问题的解决。25日，第五届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过一项决议，批准苏联政府关于停止核武器试验问题和关于柏林问题的政策。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在会议上指出，苏联愿意随时同美国和英国签订停止核试验协定；并且指出，直接有关国家举行合理的谈判，是解决柏林问题的最正确的途径。
    此外，12月19日至20日在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平理事会执行委员会会议发表声明，呼吁世界和平力量再接再厉，迫使外国军队撤出德国、南朝鲜和中国领土台湾。26日，越南民主共和国总理范文同写信给南越吴庭艳，建议双方最近举行会议，就越南统一的几项重要问题进行讨论和达成协议；并且要求南越当局改变依附美帝国主义的政策，重申越南统一问题不允许任何外国人进行任何干涉。
    所有这些都再一次体现了社会主义阵营各国人民和一切爱好和平人民的和平愿望。
    从岁尾看1958年，这一年是社会主义阵营各国空前跃进、空前繁荣的一年，也是它们为和平事业不断作出重大贡献的一年。社会主义的无限饱满的青春活力，社会主义国家的和平政策，鼓舞着社会主义阵营各国人民和全体进步人类，为世界和平和人类美好的未来进行不倦的斗争。
    西风残照险象丛生
    回过头来看帝国主义阵营。1958年最后半个月所发生的事件，是帝国主义阵营日益走向四分五裂的一幅生动的写照。
    12月16日至18日召开的北大西洋集团理事会会议，集中地暴露了帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的深刻化和复杂化。首先是美国的领导权受到了“盟国”的严重挑战：法国要求建立美、英、法“三巨头核心”；西德、意大利、加拿大和北欧各国要求加强“政治磋商”；英国则由在野的蒙哥马利元帅出面主张以欧洲人代替美国将军来担任“盟军”最高司令。其次是英、法、西德为了争夺西欧霸权和二号“盟主”的地位而在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的问题上展开了白热化的斗争。此外还有英国、希腊和土耳其在塞浦路斯问题上的矛盾，英国和冰岛在冰岛领海问题上的矛盾，西德和北欧各国在北欧部队指挥权问题上的矛盾等等。
    三天的会议中，尽管杜勒斯声嘶力竭地叫喊“共产主义威胁”的严重性和“西方团结”的必要性，然而，帝国主义终究是遵循着已故英国首相帕默斯通的“我们没有永久的盟友，我们的利益才是永久的”这句“格言”行事的。因此，会议的最后公报除了在柏林问题上叫嚣一通之外，对所有一切现存的矛盾，提不出任何解决的办法。
    事实是无情的。公报所竭力企图掩饰的西欧各国之间的经济矛盾，还不到十天，就以货币战的形式公开爆发了。12月27日，法国为了提高出口商品的竞争能力，以便进入今年1月1日成立的“共同市场”阵地，向英国商品开火，宣布法郎贬值并实行有限度的自由兑换。在同一时间，英国宣布扩大英镑的自由兑换，以提高英国商品的竞争能力，抗击“共同市场”。也是同一天，其他西欧国家接着也采取了同英国类似的措施。建立了八年的、曾经被吹嘘为象征“经济合作”的“欧洲支付同盟”就此宣告垮台。
    这场以英法为主而展开的货币战，标志着这些国家为了摆脱迫在眉睫的经济危机，已经不得不采取挺而走险的手段。大家知道，货币贬值的后果必然是国内物价的全面上涨、通货膨胀和增加税收，这就不能不更削减人民的购买力，从而加深经济危机。而在黄金储备不足的情况下实行自由兑换，也不可避免地要导致货币贬值及其一切恶性后果。
    早已陷入经济危机中的美国正在竭力挣扎。艾森豪威尔在12月22日发表的关于美国新预算的声明，就是这种挣扎的具体表现。在过去的一年中，美国政府企图用大量增加开支的办法刺激经济，摆脱生产“过剩”的危机。结果是生产“过剩”危机依然严重，而大量开支又引起了严重的财政危机和通货膨胀。于是艾森豪威尔的新预算又打算用紧缩开支、增加收入的办法来挽救财政危机和制止通货膨胀。所谓紧缩开支仅仅是削减农业、失业救济和住房建筑等方面的民用开支，军事费用反而大大增加；所谓增加收入则是直接掠夺普通人民，如提高邮资和汽油税等。姑不论这种办法是否能制止通货膨胀，但是，人民购买力的进一步降低和民用工业的进一步萎缩，将使生产“过剩”的危机加深发展，则是肯定无疑的了。
    矛盾、分裂、危机、挣扎——帝国主义阵营就是这样凄凄惨惨地辞别了旧岁，摇摇晃晃地跨入了新的一年！
    当然，帝国主义阵营各国仍然在加强“冷战”和积极从事扩军备战，它们妄想用“冷战”和扩军备战的办法来缓和内部矛盾和经济危机。
    但是，过去一年的事实已经证明，“冷战”和扩军备战只能促进各国人民的坚决反对，加深帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾和经济危机。帝国主义针对着民族主义国家而进行的任何阴谋活动，也以失败而告终。各国人民在庆祝过去一年中的伟大成就和欢欣鼓舞地迎接新年的时候，将以高度的警惕性严密注意帝国主义的一切战争活动，加强斗志，保卫和平，使1959年成为社会主义和世界和平力量取得更大的胜利和帝国主义遭受更大失败的一年。
