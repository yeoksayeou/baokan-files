Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 30th: According to a report in "Revolución," the organ of the Cuban July 26th Movement, Guevara, a general in the Cuban Armed Forces, believes that in order to rebuild the Cuban economy, it is necessary to nationalize the national resources controlled by foreign countries. Guevara made this view in a speech to the "Era Society" on the evening of the 28th.

　　In his speech, Guevara emphasized that Cuba's public utilities and natural resources must be operated with Cuba's own capital. He also believes that the basic points of Cuba's recovery plan should be to revise the laws concerning tariffs and agricultural development. Guevara finally emphasized, "We must be prepared to deal with the countermeasures of those who control 75% of the Cuban market."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 30th: Nicolás Guillén, Cuba's distinguished poet, recently told a reporter from the Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" that the Cuban people's victorious struggle against Batista will have a tremendous impact on the Latin American people's struggle against tyranny and imperialism. The poet, who won the Stalin Peace Prize, made these remarks to a reporter from "El Siglo" while passing through Chile on his way home after six years in exile.

　　The poet said that if the Cuban people can remain united in the face of foreign interference and counter-revolutionary conspiracies, the Cuban people's victory will be ultimately consolidated. When talking about the Castro government's trials and executions of Batista elements, Guillén pointed out that the United States is putting pressure on Cuba and attempting to split the democratic forces in Cuba.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 30th: According to the Venezuelan newspaper "El Universal," Lázaro Peña, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions and a well-known leader of the Latin American workers' movement, has returned to Cuba.

　　Peña was formerly the leader of the Cuban sugar workers and once the General Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation. He has a thirty-five-year history in the trade union movement and in the struggle to unite all democratic forces in Cuba. Due to persecution by the Batista dictatorship, Peña had been in exile abroad since 1953.

    新华社30日讯　哈瓦那消息：据古巴7月26日运动机关报“革命”报道，古巴武装部队将领格瓦拉认为，要重建古巴的经济必须把外国所控制的国家资源收归国有。格瓦拉是在28日晚上对“时代协会”的演说中发表这一看法的。
    格瓦拉在演说中强调指出，古巴的公共事业和自然资源必须用古巴自己的资本来经营。他还认为古巴恢复计划的基本点应该是修改有关关税和农业发展的法令。格瓦拉最后强调说，“我们必须准备好来应付那些控制古巴市场75％的人的对策”。
    新华社30日讯　圣地亚哥消息：古巴卓越的诗人尼科拉斯·纪廉最近对智利“世纪报”记者说，古巴人民反对巴蒂斯塔的胜利斗争将在拉丁美洲人民反对暴政和帝国主义的斗争中产生巨大反响。这位曾获得斯大林和平奖金的诗人是在出外流亡六年以后在回国途中经过智利时对“世纪报”记者说这番话的。
    这位诗人说，古巴人民如能在外国的干涉和策划反革命的阴谋面前保持团结一致的话，古巴人民的胜利就会得到最后的巩固。纪廉在谈到卡斯特罗政府对巴蒂斯塔分子的审讯和处决时指出，美国在对古巴施加压力，并企图分裂古巴的民主力量。
    新华社30日讯　加拉加斯消息：据委内瑞拉“宇宙报”报道，世界工会联合会书记、著名的拉丁美洲工人运动领袖拉萨罗·培尼亚已经回到古巴。
    培尼亚以前是古巴糖业工人的领袖，一度是古巴工人联合会的总书记。他在工会运动和争取团结古巴所有民主力量的斗争中已有三十五年的历史。由于受到巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的迫害，培尼亚从1953年以来一直流亡在国外。
