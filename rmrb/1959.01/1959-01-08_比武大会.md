    Skills Competition
    At the Hewang Chemical Works construction site in the Fanjiatun Management Area of Huaide County, Jilin Province, the practice of comparing new and old tools was adopted, demonstrating the superiority of the new tools and promoting the tool reform movement on the construction site.
    By mid-October of last year, this construction site had already created, imitated, and modified 32 types and 238 pieces of water conservancy construction tools for transporting earth, ramming, etc., achieving mechanization of earthwork construction. Many people who mastered the new tools praised them as "labor-saving and efficient." However, some people were skeptical of the new tools, saying that using them was "troublesome" and not as "easy" as carrying earth. To promote the tool reform movement, the construction site Corps Party Committee held a skills competition between new and old tools. The new tools participating in the competition included rope-pulled trackless vehicles, wheelbarrows, and hand-operated winches for transporting earth. Sun Xiujian and Ren Jian volunteered to participate in earth carrying, wanting to compete with the new tools.
    The competition began. People using the new tools were in high spirits. The trackless vehicles they operated could pull eighty baskets of earth at a time; the revolving earth transporters moved earth from the center of the river to the bank as lightly as swings. Sun Xiujian and Ren Jian, who participated in carrying earth, were both strong men, and they did have some energy at the beginning, but no matter how hard they tried to speed up, they couldn't keep up. The weather at the time was freezing, but they were covered in sweat. Ren Jian, seeing that he was falling further and further behind, knew he couldn't win, but he still refused to admit defeat. He said to Sun Xiujian, "Work hard, those 'gadgets' of theirs won't last long." He pinned his hopes on the new tools breaking down. But their hopes were dashed; none of the new tools malfunctioned. Regardless of the type of new tool, its efficiency was several times higher than carrying it on one's shoulders. The first day's competition naturally ended with the defeat of Sun and Ren.
    The next day, Ren Jian, afraid of continuing the competition, left the construction site on some pretext. Sun Xiujian still refused to admit defeat, and he found a partner to continue competing with the new tools. The result of this day's competition was that the people operating the new tools transported an average of ten cubic meters of earth each, more than twice as much as carrying it on one's shoulders.
    On the third day, Sun Xiujian announced his defeat and went to load earth onto the double-track earth transporter early in the morning, no longer daring to compete. On this day, the new tools displayed even greater power, with an average of eleven cubic meters of earth transported per person.
    Through this competition between new and old tools, people's minds were effectively liberated. Even Ren Chongwen, who originally said that the new tools were not easy to use, automatically started using a wheelbarrow. A wave of tool reform appeared everywhere on the construction site. The first battalion made thirty-six carts in four days. They also began to modify four types of tools, such as hand-operated winches. After modification, the efficiency will be increased by one to two times, reaching twenty cubic meters of earth transported per person per day.

    比武大会
    吉林省怀德县人民公社范家屯管理区河网化工地，采用新旧工具比武的办法，显示了新工具的优越性，推动了工地上的工具改革运动。
    这个工地在去年10月中旬，就创造、仿制和改制出运土、夯实等水利施工工具三十二种、二百三十八件，实现了施工土机械化。许多掌握了新工具的人，都称赞新工具“省工、出活”。可是，也有少数人对新工具抱怀疑态度，他们说用新工具“麻烦”，不如挑土“省事”。工地兵团党委为了推动工具改革运动，曾经召开了新旧工具比武大会。参加比赛的新工具有绳索无轨牵引车、独轮手推车、手摇轳辘运土器等。自报参加挑土的有孙秀俭，任俭二人，他俩人要同新工具比个高低。
    比赛开始了。使用新工具的人情绪很高，他们操纵的无轨牵引车一次能拉八十篮子土；转马运土器像打秋千一样，轻飘飘地把土方从河心搬到岸上。参加挑土的孙秀俭和任俭，虽然都是好汉子，开始时也真有股子劲，但不管他们怎样加紧脚步，还是跟不上趟。当时的天气滴水成冰，他们却满头大汗。任俭看着越拉越道远，心里知比不过，但仍不服输，他对孙秀俭说：“好好干，他们那些‘家伙’用不长的。”他把胜利寄托在新工具出毛病上。但他们的希望落空了，新工具没一件出毛病，不论哪种新工具，效率比肩挑都高好几倍。第一天的比赛，自然以孙、任二人的失败宣告结束。
    第二天，任俭怕接着比赛，借故离开工地。孙秀俭仍不服输，他又找了一个伙伴，继续和新工具比赛。这一天比赛结果，操纵新工具的人，平均每人运土十方，比肩挑多两倍。
    第三天，孙秀俭宣布服输，早早的就去给双线运土器装土，再也不敢比赛了。这一天新工具发挥了更大的威力，平均每人运土达到十一方。
    通过这次新旧工具的比赛，有力地解放了人们的思想，连原来说新工具不好使的任崇文，也自动使起独轮手推车了。工地上到处出现工具改革的热潮，第一营四天时间就制成车子三十六台。他们还开始改制手摇轳辘等四种工具，制成后将提高效率一倍至两倍，达到每人每天运土二十方。
