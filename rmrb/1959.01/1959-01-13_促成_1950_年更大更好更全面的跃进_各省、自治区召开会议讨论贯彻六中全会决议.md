Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th January: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from December 20th to 30th, 1958. Based on the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Chairman Mao, the meeting discussed the rectification and improvement of the people's communes and comprehensively arranged the various tasks of the autonomous region for 1959.

    The meeting pointed out that the tremendous achievements made in various tasks in the autonomous region in 1958 were the result of the people of all ethnic groups resolutely implementing the Party's general line for building socialism under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The experience of the past year proves that the socialist construction of the autonomous region can only develop smoothly and achieve great success if the national question is correctly resolved and if there is close and inseparable unity between all nationalities. For this reason, it is necessary to oppose both Han chauvinism and local nationalism. The struggle against local nationalism among cadres in the autonomous region in 1958 achieved a victory of great historical significance, providing favorable conditions for the autonomous region to further fundamentally resolve the national question, thereby further uniting cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups and providing a reliable political foundation for the development of the autonomous region's socialist construction.

    The meeting arranged the work of rectifying and improving the people's communes and the national economic plan of the autonomous region for 1959 according to the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. It requires that, from now until June of this year, in close combination with production, the people's communes should be rectified and consolidated. Efforts should be made to lay the foundation for rectification work before this year's spring plowing, and to continue and complete this work after the spring plowing. The meeting pointed out that the key to doing a good job in rectification work lies in doing a good job in socialist and communist education. All localities should immediately launch this work in rural and pastoral areas.

    The meeting pointed out that developing production is the central link in consolidating the people's communes. It is necessary to seriously summarize the production experience of the communes in 1958 through rectification work, arrange the production plan for 1959, and immediately organize the masses to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, reform agricultural tools, and start preparing for spring plowing to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1959. In addition to doing a good job in agricultural production, the people's communes must also implement the policy of simultaneously developing agriculture and industry, and run processing industries for agricultural and animal husbandry products, repair and manufacture industries for agricultural tools and machinery, as well as fertilizer, pesticides, mining, metallurgy, and power industries. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and transportation, and effectively achieve a combination of self-sufficient production and commodity production. The meeting also required all localities to improve the lives of commune members on the basis of doing a good job in production. In collective life, the customs and habits of all ethnic groups should be taken into account.

    The meeting believes that the direction of animal husbandry development, like agriculture, should also be transformed from cooperatives to people's communes. Since the cooperativization of animal husbandry was later, the situation in pastoral areas is more complicated, and the work foundation is poor, the steps of transforming to communes can be slightly slower, and the time can be slightly longer, but it must be done. At present, in pastoral areas, in addition to vigorously rectifying the existing people's communes, it is also necessary to pay attention to rectifying animal husbandry cooperatives. In the rectification of cooperatives, those with conditions can be transformed into people's communes, and those without conditions can be considered for transformation when the conditions are ripe on the basis of making the work more solid.

    In order to do a good job in the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, the meeting proposed that work teams should be immediately organized jointly by the autonomous region, special districts, autonomous prefectures, counties, and communes, led by the first secretaries of the party committees at all levels, and this work should be carried out in close combination with rural production.

    The meeting pointed out that 1959 will be a year of greater leap forward in the socialist construction of the autonomous region, and there are many and heavy tasks, but the central tasks are to grasp steel and grain.

    In order to complete the various tasks in 1959, the meeting required that party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries, must grasp industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, and currently must focus on grasping agriculture, and simultaneously arrange and carry out other work in combination with the central work.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 12th January: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary (enlarged) meeting from December 27th of last year to January 9th of this year to convey and discuss the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Chairman Mao. Based on the spirit of the Resolution, the meeting summarized the achievements of the great leap forward in the autonomous region in 1958, adopted various industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production targets for 1959, and arranged the work for the first quarter.

    The meeting pointed out that last year, under the guidance of the policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward, the autonomous region mobilized people of all ethnic groups to oppose conservatism, emancipate their minds, and, after arduous struggle, achieved great success in various tasks.

    The meeting pointed out that the development of the people's commune movement in the autonomous region was also rapid. Last year, more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives were reorganized into 682 people's communes, and pastoral areas have also basically achieved communization.

    According to the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting discussed the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and adopted the Decision on Several Questions Concerning the Rectification and Consolidation of People's Communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The decision requires all localities to conduct the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes in close combination with production before the spring plowing. The secretaries of the party committees in charge of agriculture in various localities should lead and organize a team to do this work well.

    The meeting also decided to establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Support Baotou Steel Construction Committee to strengthen the support for the construction of Baotou Steel.

    According to the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the specific conditions of Inner Mongolia, the meeting proposed industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production targets that are a greater leap forward than in 1958, and required all localities to focus on the following tasks at present: (1) Grasp ideological work and prepare for the rectification of the people's communes and spring plowing; (2) Take steel as the key link and solve the problems existing in coke production, transportation, and supporting work; (3) Grasp the work of improving the rural financial and trade system to meet the needs of the development of the people's communes; (4) Further strengthen mutual assistance between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas to facilitate the development of urban and rural production; (5) While grasping ideology and production, grasp the work of caring for the people's lives so that the people of all ethnic groups in the region can continuously improve their lives on the basis of developing production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 12th January: The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary committee meeting from January 6th to 7th. Prior to this meeting, the provincial party committee convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural (autonomous prefectural, municipal) party committees and a meeting of county (municipal) party committee secretaries attended by some secretaries of people's commune party committees, in preparation for this plenary session.

    The meeting seriously studied and discussed the communiqué and resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the important speech of Comrade Mao Zedong at the meeting. The participants in the meeting particularly studied in detail the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session, and they unanimously expressed their warm support and resolute implementation. The meeting also adopted the "Resolution on Rectifying and Consolidating People's Communes" based on the spirit of this resolution.

     The "Resolution on Rectifying and Consolidating People's Communes" pointed out that the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes should first and foremost enhance the socialist and communist consciousness of cadres and the masses. To this end, it is first necessary to widely and deeply launch a movement to study and publicize the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Secondly, all people's communes should earnestly summarize the achievements and experiences of the leap forward in various construction undertakings in 1958, and with greater enthusiasm, welcome the greater leap forward in 1959. The resolution emphasized the need to implement the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily, running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, advocating careful calculation, planning grain use, and opposing extravagance and waste due to bumper harvests. The resolution also emphasized that whether it is industrial or agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, or fishery production, or any welfare undertaking, from the commune to the production team, a personal responsibility system should be established; the principle of democratic centralism must be implemented, and unified leadership and hierarchical management should be implemented.

    Guizhou Province achieved great achievements on all fronts in 1958. On this basis, the meeting arranged the economic plan for 1959 according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session. The meeting summarized the experience of the Party's leadership work in 1958 and pointed out that the Party's leadership work in 1959 should focus on both ends (that is, grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other), seize the key points, continue to exert great effort, and lead the people of the province to leap forward forward in a greater, better, and more comprehensive manner.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Working Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of the Communist Party of China recently held a plenary meeting to convey the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and, according to the spirit of the Resolution, arranged the industrial and agricultural production of the entire region for 1959.

    During the meeting, all participating cadres seriously studied and discussed the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and unanimously expressed their warm support. The meeting decided to continue to exert great effort, oppose right-leaning conservatism, and strive for a greater leap forward in 1959 in a spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    The meeting made arrangements for industrial and agricultural production in 1959, especially in the first quarter. In terms of steel production, it was decided to rectify and improve the "small-scale indigenous furnaces" and gradually establish "small-scale modern furnaces." It is also necessary to grasp capital construction, electricity, transportation, machinery production, and the installation of smelting equipment so that the steel industry in the region can quickly achieve basification, industrialization, and mechanization.

    The meeting emphasized that industrial production should be under unified leadership and comprehensive arrangement. It is necessary to grasp both the center—steel production—and general industrial production; to grasp both the steel base and general factories and mines; and to grasp both the industrial production of people's communes; so that the various industrial sectors can coordinate and advance, and further implement the policy of walking on two legs. In the first quarter, not only should mass production movements be launched in factories and mines, but also mass movements for industrial production should be launched in people's communes. We should summarize the experience of commune industry in building factories and industrial production, and rectify the existing 9,300 small factories in the region. We should give full play to the production potential of existing factories and mines, utilize existing equipment, and scientifically divide labor among the factories.

    The meeting believes that the key to realizing the 1959 grain production plan in agriculture is to implement the basic farmland system. We must mobilize farmers of all ethnic groups in the region to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production in basic farmland. We should launch a vigorous winter production movement, grasp water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and prepare for a bumper harvest in 1959; at the same time, we should do a good job in the diversified management and commodity production of people's communes, invigorate commodity circulation, and promote the development of agricultural production.

    The meeting believes that it is necessary to concentrate forces at present, according to the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to organize thousands of cadres to go deep into the countryside to rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes, and to lay a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.

    促成1950年更大更好更全面的跃进
    各省、自治区召开会议讨论贯彻六中全会决议
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐12日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会在1958年12月20日到30日举行扩大会议，根据党的八届六中全会决议和毛主席的指示的精神，讨论了整顿和健全人民公社的问题，并全面安排了自治区1959年的各项工作。
    会议指出，1958年自治区各项工作取得的巨大成就，是各族人民在党中央、毛主席正确领导下，坚决执行了党的建设社会主义总路线的结果。一年来的经验证明，自治区的社会主义建设事业要能顺利发展和取得巨大成就，必须正确地解决民族问题，必须有各民族亲密无间的团结。为此就需要既反对大民族主义，又反对地方民族主义。1958年在自治区干部中开展的反对地方民族主义的斗争，取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利，为自治区进一步从根本上解决民族问题提供了有利条件，从而使各族干部和人民群众进一步亲密团结起来，使自治区社会主义建设事业的发展有了可靠的政治基础。
    会议根据八届六中全会决议的精神，对整顿和健全人民公社的工作和自治区1959年国民经济的计划工作作了安排。要求自现在起到今年6月，紧密结合生产，对人民公社进行一次整顿和巩固工作。争取在今年春耕以前打下整社工作的基础，到春耕后继续进行和完成这一工作。会议指出，作好整社工作的关键，在于搞好社会主义和共产主义教育工作。各地应立即在农村和牧区普遍开展这一工作。
    会议指出，发展生产是巩固人民公社的中心环节。必须通过整社工作认真总结公社1958年的生产经验，安排好1959年的生产计划，并且立即组织群众兴修水利、积肥、改革农具、工具，着手进行春耕的准备工作，以保证1959年农业大丰收。人民公社除搞好农业生产外，还必须贯彻农业、工业同时并举的方针，举办农牧产品加工工业、农具和农业机械的修配和某些制造工业，以及肥料、农药、采矿、冶金和电力工业等。此外，要搞好林业、牧业、副业、渔业和交通运输业，切实做到自给性生产和商品性生产并举。会议还要求各地在搞好生产的基础上搞好公社社员的生活。在集体生活中，要照顾各民族的风俗习惯。
    会议认为，畜牧业发展的方向，和农业一样，也应该由合作社转为人民公社。由于畜牧业合作化的时间较晚，牧区的情况较复杂和工作基础较差，转公社的步骤可以稍慢一些，时间可以稍长一些，但是一定要搞。目前，在牧业区除必须大力整顿现有的人民公社外，还必须注意整顿牧业合作社。在整顿合作社中，有条件的社可以转为人民公社，没有条件的可以在把工作做得更扎实的基础上，在条件成熟时再考虑转的问题。
    为搞好人民公社的整顿和巩固工作，会议提出立即由自治区、专区、自治州、县、公社共同组织工作团，由各级党委第一书记挂帅，紧密结合农村生产，领导开展这一工作。
    会议指出，1959年将是自治区社会主义建设事业更大跃进的一年，任务很多很繁重，但是中心任务是抓钢铁和抓粮食。
    为完成1959年的各项工作任务，会议要求各级党委特别是第一书记，必须一手抓工业，一手抓农业，当前必须以抓农业为中心，结合中心工作同时安排和进行其它工作。
    内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特12日电　中共内蒙古自治区委员会去年12月27日到今年1月9日举行全体委员（扩大）会议，传达、讨论党的八届六中全会决议和毛主席的指示，并根据决议的精神总结了1958年自治区大跃进的成就，通过了1959年工农牧业各项生产指标和安排了第一季度工作。
  会议指出，去年自治区在以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针指导下，发动各族人民反对保守，解放思想，经过奋勇苦战，各项工作都取得了巨大成就。
    会议指出，自治区人民公社化运动的发展也是迅速的，去年有一万多个农业生产合作社改组成为六百八十二个人民公社，牧区也已经基本实现了公社化。
    会议根据党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的精神，讨论了内蒙古自治区人民公社的整顿和巩固问题，并且通过了内蒙古自治区关于整顿巩固人民公社若干问题的决定。决定中要求各地春耕以前，紧密结合生产进行整顿和巩固人民公社工作。由各地党委分管农业的书记，领导、组织一支队伍，把这一工作作好。
    会上还决定成立内蒙古自治区支援包钢建设委员会，加强支援包钢的建设工作。
    会议根据党的八届六中全会决议精神和内蒙古的具体情况，提出了比1958年更大跃进的工、农、牧林等业的生产指标，并要求各地当前抓好以下几项工作：（一）抓好思想工作，做好整顿人民公社和春耕的准备工作；（二）以钢为纲，解决焦炭生产、交通运输和配套工作中存在的问题；（三）抓好改进农村财贸制度的工作，以便适应人民公社发展的需要；（四）进一步加强工农互助、城乡互助，便利发展城乡生产；（五）在抓思想、抓生产同时，抓好关心人民生活的工作，使全区各族人民在发展生产的基础上，不断改善生活。
    贵州
    新华社贵阳12日电　中共贵州省委于1月6日到7日举行了全体委员会议。在这次会议之前，省委召开了地（州、市）委书记会议和有部分人民公社党委书记参加的县（市）委书记会议，为这次全会作了准备。
    会议认真学习和讨论了党的八届六中全会的公报、决议和毛泽东同志在会议上的重要讲话。参加会议的人特别详细地逐段学习了六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，他们一致表示热烈拥护并坚决贯彻执行。会议还根据这个决议的精神，通过了“关于整顿和巩固人民公社的决议”。
      “关于整顿和巩固人民公社的决议”指出，整顿和巩固人民公社，首先应该是提高干部和群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟。为此，首先要广泛深入地开展一个学习和宣传党的八届六中全会文件的运动。其次，各人民公社应认真总结1958年各项建设事业跃进的成绩和经验，并以更大干劲，迎接1959年的更大跃进。决议中强调要贯彻勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的原则，提倡精打细算，计划用粮，反对因丰收而发生铺张浪费现象。决议还强调指出，无论是工业或农、林、牧、副、渔等业各项生产，无论是任何一项生活福利事业，从公社直到生产队，都应切实建立起专人负责制；必须贯彻民主集中制的原则，实行统一领导，分级管理。
    贵州省1958年在各个战线上都取得了巨大成就，在这个基础上，会议根据六中全会精神，安排了1959年的经济计划。会议总结了1958年党的领导工作方面的经验，并且指出，1959年党的领导工作应该心挂两头（就是一手抓工业、一手抓农业），抓住重点，继续鼓足干劲，领导全省人民更大更好更全面地向前跃进。
    宁夏
    据新华社讯　中共宁夏回族自治区工作委员会最近举行全体会议，传达党的八届六中全会决议，并根据决议精神安排全区1959年的工农业生产。
    会议期间，全体与会干部，对党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，进行了认真学习和讨论，一致表示热烈拥护。会议决定要继续鼓足干劲，反对右倾保守，以实事求是的精神，力争1959年更大的跃进。
    会议对1959年，特别是第一季度的工农业生产作了安排。在钢铁生产方面，确定要对“小土群”进行整顿、提高，逐步建立起“小洋群”。还要抓基本建设，抓电力、运输，抓机械生产，抓冶炼设备的安装工作等，使全区钢铁工业迅速实现基地化、工厂化和机械化。
    会议强调指出，工业生产应统一领导和全面安排，既要抓中心——钢铁生产，也要抓一般工业生产；要抓钢铁基地、一般厂矿，也要抓人民公社的工业生产；使各工业部门互相协调前进，并进一步贯彻两条腿走路的方针。在第一季度中，不只要在厂矿中开展群众性的生产运动，也要在人民公社中开展工业生产的群众运动。应当总结公社工业建厂和工业生产的经验，整顿全区现有的九千三百个小厂。要充分发挥现有厂矿的生产潜力，利用现有设备，并对各厂进行科学分工。
    会议认为：农业生产方面，实现1959年粮食产量计划的关键是贯彻实行基本农田制度。要动员全区各族农民，认真在基本农田中执行农业生产的“八字宪法”。掀起一个热火朝天的冬季生产运动，抓好水利和积肥，为1959年的大丰收作好准备；同时搞好人民公社的多种经营和商品生产，活跃商品流转，促进农业生产的发展。
    会议认为，当前必须集中力量，根据八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，组织成千上万的干部，深入农村整顿、巩固和提高人民公社，为1959年农业生产的更大跃进打好基础。
