Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th January: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting from December 20th to 30th, 1958. Based on the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Chairman Mao, the meeting discussed the rectification and improvement of the people's communes and comprehensively arranged the various tasks of the autonomous region for 1959.

    The meeting pointed out that the tremendous achievements made in various tasks in the autonomous region in 1958 were the result of the people of all ethnic groups resolutely implementing the Party's general line for building socialism under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The experience of the past year proves that the socialist construction of the autonomous region can only develop smoothly and achieve great success if the national question is correctly resolved and if there is close and inseparable unity between all nationalities. For this reason, it is necessary to oppose both Han chauvinism and local nationalism. The struggle against local nationalism among cadres in the autonomous region in 1958 achieved a victory of great historical significance, providing favorable conditions for the autonomous region to further fundamentally resolve the national question, thereby further uniting cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups and providing a reliable political foundation for the development of the autonomous region's socialist construction.

    The meeting arranged the work of rectifying and improving the people's communes and the national economic plan of the autonomous region for 1959 according to the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. It requires that, from now until June of this year, in close combination with production, the people's communes should be rectified and consolidated. Efforts should be made to lay the foundation for rectification work before this year's spring plowing, and to continue and complete this work after the spring plowing. The meeting pointed out that the key to doing a good job in rectification work lies in doing a good job in socialist and communist education. All localities should immediately launch this work in rural and pastoral areas.

    The meeting pointed out that developing production is the central link in consolidating the people's communes. It is necessary to seriously summarize the production experience of the communes in 1958 through rectification work, arrange the production plan for 1959, and immediately organize the masses to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, reform agricultural tools, and start preparing for spring plowing to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1959. In addition to doing a good job in agricultural production, the people's communes must also implement the policy of simultaneously developing agriculture and industry, and run processing industries for agricultural and animal husbandry products, repair and manufacture industries for agricultural tools and machinery, as well as fertilizer, pesticides, mining, metallurgy, and power industries. In addition, it is necessary to do a good job in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and transportation, and effectively achieve a combination of self-sufficient production and commodity production. The meeting also required all localities to improve the lives of commune members on the basis of doing a good job in production. In collective life, the customs and habits of all ethnic groups should be taken into account.

    The meeting believes that the direction of animal husbandry development, like agriculture, should also be transformed from cooperatives to people's communes. Since the cooperativization of animal husbandry was later, the situation in pastoral areas is more complicated, and the work foundation is poor, the steps of transforming to communes can be slightly slower, and the time can be slightly longer, but it must be done. At present, in pastoral areas, in addition to vigorously rectifying the existing people's communes, it is also necessary to pay attention to rectifying animal husbandry cooperatives. In the rectification of cooperatives, those with conditions can be transformed into people's communes, and those without conditions can be considered for transformation when the conditions are ripe on the basis of making the work more solid.

    In order to do a good job in the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, the meeting proposed that work teams should be immediately organized jointly by the autonomous region, special districts, autonomous prefectures, counties, and communes, led by the first secretaries of the party committees at all levels, and this work should be carried out in close combination with rural production.

    The meeting pointed out that 1959 will be a year of greater leap forward in the socialist construction of the autonomous region, and there are many and heavy tasks, but the central tasks are to grasp steel and grain.

    In order to complete the various tasks in 1959, the meeting required that party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries, must grasp industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, and currently must focus on grasping agriculture, and simultaneously arrange and carry out other work in combination with the central work.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 12th January: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary (enlarged) meeting from December 27th of last year to January 9th of this year to convey and discuss the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Chairman Mao. Based on the spirit of the Resolution, the meeting summarized the achievements of the great leap forward in the autonomous region in 1958, adopted various industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production targets for 1959, and arranged the work for the first quarter.

    The meeting pointed out that last year, under the guidance of the policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward, the autonomous region mobilized people of all ethnic groups to oppose conservatism, emancipate their minds, and, after arduous struggle, achieved great success in various tasks.

    The meeting pointed out that the development of the people's commune movement in the autonomous region was also rapid. Last year, more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives were reorganized into 682 people's communes, and pastoral areas have also basically achieved communization.

    According to the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting discussed the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and adopted the Decision on Several Questions Concerning the Rectification and Consolidation of People's Communes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The decision requires all localities to conduct the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's communes in close combination with production before the spring plowing. The secretaries of the party committees in charge of agriculture in various localities should lead and organize a team to do this work well.

    The meeting also decided to establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Support Baotou Steel Construction Committee to strengthen the support for the construction of Baotou Steel.

    According to the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the specific conditions of Inner Mongolia, the meeting proposed industrial, agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production targets that are a greater leap forward than in 1958, and required all localities to focus on the following tasks at present: (1) Grasp ideological work and prepare for the rectification of the people's communes and spring plowing; (2) Take steel as the key link and solve the problems existing in coke production, transportation, and supporting work; (3) Grasp the work of improving the rural financial and trade system to meet the needs of the development of the people's communes; (4) Further strengthen mutual assistance between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas to facilitate the development of urban and rural production; (5) While grasping ideology and production, grasp the work of caring for the people's lives so that the people of all ethnic groups in the region can continuously improve their lives on the basis of developing production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 12th January: The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary committee meeting from January 6th to 7th. Prior to this meeting, the provincial party committee convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural (autonomous prefectural, municipal) party committees and a meeting of county (municipal) party committee secretaries attended by some secretaries of people's commune party committees, in preparation for this plenary session.

    The meeting seriously studied and discussed the communiqu√© and resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the important speech of Comrade Mao Zedong at the meeting. The participants in the meeting particularly studied in detail the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session, and they unanimously expressed their warm support and resolute implementation. The meeting also adopted the "Resolution on Rectifying and Consolidating People's Communes" based on the spirit of this resolution.

     The "Resolution on Rectifying and Consolidating People's Communes" pointed out that the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes should first and foremost enhance the socialist and communist consciousness of cadres and the masses. To this end, it is first necessary to widely and deeply launch a movement to study and publicize the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Secondly, all people's communes should earnestly summarize the achievements and experiences of the leap forward in various construction undertakings in 1958, and with greater enthusiasm, welcome the greater leap forward in 1959. The resolution emphasized the need to implement the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily, running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, advocating careful calculation, planning grain use, and opposing extravagance and waste due to bumper harvests. The resolution also emphasized that whether it is industrial or agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, or fishery production, or any welfare undertaking, from the commune to the production team, a personal responsibility system should be established; the principle of democratic centralism must be implemented, and unified leadership and hierarchical management should be implemented.

    Guizhou Province achieved great achievements on all fronts in 1958. On this basis, the meeting arranged the economic plan for 1959 according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session. The meeting summarized the experience of the Party's leadership work in 1958 and pointed out that the Party's leadership work in 1959 should focus on both ends (that is, grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other), seize the key points, continue to exert great effort, and lead the people of the province to leap forward forward in a greater, better, and more comprehensive manner.

Xinhua News Agency report: The Working Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of the Communist Party of China recently held a plenary meeting to convey the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and, according to the spirit of the Resolution, arranged the industrial and agricultural production of the entire region for 1959.

    During the meeting, all participating cadres seriously studied and discussed the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and unanimously expressed their warm support. The meeting decided to continue to exert great effort, oppose right-leaning conservatism, and strive for a greater leap forward in 1959 in a spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    The meeting made arrangements for industrial and agricultural production in 1959, especially in the first quarter. In terms of steel production, it was decided to rectify and improve the "small-scale indigenous furnaces" and gradually establish "small-scale modern furnaces." It is also necessary to grasp capital construction, electricity, transportation, machinery production, and the installation of smelting equipment so that the steel industry in the region can quickly achieve basification, industrialization, and mechanization.

    The meeting emphasized that industrial production should be under unified leadership and comprehensive arrangement. It is necessary to grasp both the center‚Äîsteel production‚Äîand general industrial production; to grasp both the steel base and general factories and mines; and to grasp both the industrial production of people's communes; so that the various industrial sectors can coordinate and advance, and further implement the policy of walking on two legs. In the first quarter, not only should mass production movements be launched in factories and mines, but also mass movements for industrial production should be launched in people's communes. We should summarize the experience of commune industry in building factories and industrial production, and rectify the existing 9,300 small factories in the region. We should give full play to the production potential of existing factories and mines, utilize existing equipment, and scientifically divide labor among the factories.

    The meeting believes that the key to realizing the 1959 grain production plan in agriculture is to implement the basic farmland system. We must mobilize farmers of all ethnic groups in the region to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production in basic farmland. We should launch a vigorous winter production movement, grasp water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and prepare for a bumper harvest in 1959; at the same time, we should do a good job in the diversified management and commodity production of people's communes, invigorate commodity circulation, and promote the development of agricultural production.

    The meeting believes that it is necessary to concentrate forces at present, according to the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, to organize thousands of cadres to go deep into the countryside to rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes, and to lay a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959.
