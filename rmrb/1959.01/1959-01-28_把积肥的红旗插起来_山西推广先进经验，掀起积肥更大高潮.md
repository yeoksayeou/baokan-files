Raise the Red Flag of Manure Accumulation
Shanxi Promotes Advanced Experiences, Unleashing a Greater High Tide of Manure Accumulation

Wuzhai County mobilized the masses to speak out freely, refuting the theory of "no manure to accumulate," and found thirty-five sources of fertilizer; Xinghuo Commune in Houma City implemented "knowing fertilizer a year in advance," so everyone had a clear understanding; Dengta and Da Lü Communes established a responsibility system and implemented reasonable remuneration to increase enthusiasm for manure accumulation.

Taiyuan, January 27th (reporter of this newspaper) - Shanxi Province recently convened agricultural cadres from various prefectures and cities to summarize and study the current experiences and methods of manure accumulation and fertilizer production in various regions, in order to promote the current manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement.

Currently, the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in rural Shanxi Province has formed a high tide. The number of people involved in the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the province has reached more than 1.65 million, and various regions have also organized fertilizer professional teams with more than 400,000 people. To date, the province has accumulated more than 5 billion dan of farm manure; has produced more than 1 billion jin of local chemical fertilizers, and more than 58 million jin of bacterial fertilizers. According to these figures, the province's cultivated land has an average of more than 10,000 jin of farm manure, more than 20 jin of local chemical fertilizer, and more than 1 jin of bacterial fertilizer per mu. Recently, in order to push the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement from a high tide to a higher tide, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction specially convened a meeting to discuss the current manure accumulation work. It was found that many leadership measures and mass experiences in various regions have universal significance for guiding the current rural manure accumulation.

Wuzhai County in northwestern Shanxi has historically been a fertilizer-deficient area. When carrying out manure accumulation, the county party committee first grasped ideology and carried out mass speaking-out and debate. From the seven aspects of large-scale accumulation, large-scale production, large-scale creation, large-scale digging, large-scale composting, large-scale smoking, and large-scale burning, they found thirty-five ways to obtain fertilizer, powerfully breaking the fallacy of "no fertilizer to accumulate," and making the manure accumulation movement vigorous. After 50,000 people fiercely attacked fertilizer, the currently accumulated and produced fertilizer has exceeded five times the average fertilizer application per mu last year. The fertilizer "knowing a year in advance" created by Xinghuo Commune in the suburbs of Houma City in southern Shanxi provides an advanced method for mobilizing commune members to accumulate fertilizer. To implement this method, first calculate the commune's annual fertilizer demand, and then comprehensively plan and arrange it by season. At the same time, the commune adopted the method of assigning tasks to households and individuals, and the commune members strengthened their sense of responsibility and tried their best to accumulate fertilizer quickly and well. Houma City suburbs were originally a relatively backward area in manure accumulation work among the fourteen counties and cities in southern Shanxi. After the municipal party committee held an on-site exchange meeting in Xinghuo Commune and promoted it throughout the city's suburbs, it leaped to become an advanced area in manure accumulation in southern Shanxi. The experiences of Dengta Commune in Qin County, Da Lü Commune in Wenxi County, and Yangqu United Commune in the suburbs of Taiyuan City show that combining the establishment of a responsibility system with the reasonable handling of remuneration in manure accumulation work is conducive to both ensuring the quantity of manure accumulation and improving the quality of fertilizer. These communes, on the one hand, implemented the "five fixed" responsibility system of "fixed leadership, fixed professional teams, fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality," and on the other hand, implemented economic remuneration methods of grading and pricing according to local conditions, so that the commune can accumulate more fertilizer and better fertilizer, and the commune members also have income. The meeting also exchanged the experiences of Yicheng County in vigorously grasping composting, Wenxi County in vigorously grasping smoking fertilizer, and Jishan County in vigorously grasping local chemical fertilizer, so as to develop one type of fertilizer as the main focus and drive the entire manure accumulation movement.

Through the exchange of leadership experiences and methods of manure accumulation in various regions, the participants further clarified and proposed to continue to promote the practice of leaders personally grasping the work and leading at all levels; to combine mass movements with the establishment of professional teams, taking both approaches simultaneously; to implement annual comprehensive planning of fertilizer, arrange it by season, and announce it to the masses, so that commune members have clear targets and a clear understanding; to implement a responsibility system and reasonably arrange remuneration for commune members' manure accumulation. The cadres attending the meeting unanimously believed that current manure accumulation should not only focus on quantity, but also on quality; regardless of old or new fertilizer sources, whether large or small fertilizer sources, they should all be valued, avoiding the phenomenon of favoring the new and disliking the old, being greedy for the big and abandoning the small; various regions should find one or two main fertilizer sources and focus on them as a key to improving quality.

    把积肥的红旗插起来
    山西推广先进经验，掀起积肥更大高潮
    五寨县发动群众大鸣大放，驳倒“无肥可积”论，找到三十五种肥源；侯马市星火公社实行肥料“一年早知道”，人人心中有数；灯塔、大吕等公社建立责任制，实行合理报酬，提高积肥积极性。
    本报太原27日电　山西省最近召集各专、市农业干部总结研究当前各地积肥制肥的经验和方法，来促进当前积制肥料运动。
    目前，山西省农村积制肥料运动已经形成高潮。现在全省投入积肥制肥运动的人数已达到一百六十五万多人，各地还分别组织了拥有四十多万人的肥料专业队伍。到目前为止，全省已积农家肥料五十亿多担；已制土化肥十亿多斤，细菌肥五千八百多万斤。按这些数字计算，全省耕地已平均每亩备妥农家肥料一万斤以上，土化肥二十多斤、细菌肥一斤以上。最近，山西省农业建设厅为了把各地积制肥料运动由高潮推向更高潮，特召集会议，讨论了当前积肥工作。发现各地有不少领导措施和群众经验，对指导目前农村积肥很有普遍意义。
    晋西北五寨县是个历来缺肥的地区，开展积肥时，县委先抓思想，开展群众性的鸣放辩论，从大积、大制、大造、大挖、大沤、大熏、大烧七个方面，找出了三十五种肥料门路，有力地击破了“无肥可积”的论调，使积肥运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来。经过五万人猛攻肥料，目前积制的肥料，已超过了去年每亩平均施肥量的五倍。晋南侯马市郊区星火公社创造的肥料“一年早知道”，为发动社员积肥提供了一种先进作法。实行这种办法，首先是计算出全社全年需肥量，然后全面规划分季安排。同时社里采取任务到户到人的办法，社员更加强了责任感，想尽一切办法，积肥完成得又快又好。侯马市郊区原来是晋南十四个县、市中积肥工作较落后的地区，经过市委在星火公社举行现场交流会议，全市郊推广后，一跃而变成晋南的积肥先进地区。沁县灯塔公社、闻喜县大吕公社、太原市郊阳曲联社等公社的经验说明，在积肥工作中把建立责任制与合理处理报酬结合起来，既有利于保证积肥数量，也有利于提高肥料质量。这些公社一方面实行了“定领导、定专业队伍、定任务、定时、定质”五定责任制，一方面根据当地情况实行了分等论价的经济报酬办法，公社能多积肥、积好肥，社员也有收入。会上还交流了翼城县大抓沤肥、闻喜县大抓熏肥、稷山县大抓土化肥，以发展一项肥料为主带动整个积肥运动的经验。
    到会人员通过交流各地积肥领导经验和方法，进一步明确和提出了继续推广领导亲自抓，层层挂帅的作法；把群众运动与建立专业队伍结合起来，双管齐下；实行全年全面规划肥料，分季作安排，向群众公布，使社员明确指标，心中有数；实行责任制，合理安排社员积肥报酬。到会干部一致认为，目前积肥既要抓数量，更要抓质量；不管旧肥源不管新肥源，无论大肥源无论小肥源，都应重视，避免喜新厌旧贪大弃小现象；各地应找出一、二种主要肥源，以此为重点，作为提高质量的关键。　　　（杨义）
