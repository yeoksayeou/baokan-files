Jingxi Mining Bureau Takes Bigger Strides
This Year's Output Will Increase by Three-Quarters Compared to Last Year

    (Our Dispatch) The coal production of the Jingxi Mining Bureau will leap from 4.06 million tons last year to 7 million tons this year. This coal production plan, which represents a 75% increase over last year's actual output, has been approved by the relevant state departments after mass discussion and the formulation of practical measures. It is considered an advanced yet realistic leap forward plan.

    The bureau's leap forward pace last year was unprecedented in its history, with coal production increasing by 70% compared to the previous year. On the basis of this great leap forward, all employees studied the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and summarized the experiences of last year's great leap in production, further liberating their minds. They made a specific analysis and comparison of this year's and last year's situations, pointing out that both the spiritual and material conditions are better this year than last year: First, the political awareness and production experience of the employees have further improved compared to the beginning of last year; second, through the vigorous promotion of mechanization and semi-mechanization and the mobilization of employees' families to participate in production, labor productivity, labor force, and mechanical equipment have increased compared to the beginning of last year; third, several new mines and some indigenous and foreign-combined small mines are currently under construction, and some of them will be put into production this year. Based on these favorable conditions and the greater demands placed on the coal industry by this year's national industrial and agricultural production, the employees unanimously believe that this year will be a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward for them. Under the guidance of this thought, the employees are even more motivated. Using the experience of last year's great leap forward, they identified key points, tapped potential, and grasped measures. After thorough research, they finally formulated a coal production plan for an even greater leap forward than last year.

    In order to ensure the completion of this leap forward plan, the bureau is working hard to solve the problems of insufficient labor and insufficient materials and equipment. For example, on the basis of last year's technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, they will further inspect and rectify existing mechanized equipment. According to needs and possibilities, some indigenous machinery will be developed towards semi-indigenous and semi-foreign, and some semi-indigenous and semi-foreign machinery will be developed towards foreign. This will greatly improve labor productivity and save labor. Based on the experience of last year's great leap forward, the bureau also proportionally arranged the labor force for various productions in an overall manner and strengthened tunneling and development work to ensure that the entire production proceeds rhythmically. The various mines have also formulated specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. In order to improve coal mining methods, the Fangshan Mine launched a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate among the employees, and decided to increase the gradient of the segmented roadway slopes. This can save iron plates for coal chutes, save pit props, improve efficiency, and improve ventilation. Workers in each group have also formulated guarantee plans for their groups and individuals.

    While determining the annual production plan, the bureau also proposed to strive to overfulfill the state's plan for coal production of 1.35 million tons in the first quarter. Now, all employees are working hard, practically, and skillfully with soaring enthusiasm to complete this plan.

### 京西矿务局步子越迈越大  今年将比去年增产四分之三

    京西矿务局步子越迈越大
    今年将比去年增产四分之三
    本报讯　京西矿务局今年的产煤量将由去年的四百零六万吨跃进到七百万吨。这个比去年实际产量增长四分之三的产煤计划，在经过群众讨论和订出切实措施以后，已经国家主管部门批准，认为这是一个既先进又切实的跃进计划。
    这个局去年的跃进步伐在历史上是空前的，去年的煤产量比前年增长70％。在这个大跃进的基础上，全局职工学习了党的八届六中全会的决议，总结了去年生产大跃进的经验，思想得到进一步的解放。他们把今年和去年的情况作了具体的分析对比，指出无论是精神条件或物质条件，今年都比去年优越：第一，职工的政治觉悟和生产经验比去年年初又提高了；第二，经过大搞机械化半机械化运动和发动职工家属参加生产，劳动生产率、劳动力和机械设备比去年年初增长了；第三，现在正在建设几处新矿井和一些土洋结合的小矿井，今年将有部分矿井投入生产。职工们根据这些有利条件和今年全国工农业生产对煤炭工业提出的更大的要求，一致认为，今年是他们更大更好更全面跃进的一年。在这一思想的指导下，职工们的干劲更大。他们运用去年大跃进的经验，找关键，挖潜力，抓措施，经过切实的研究以后，终于订出了比去年更大跃进的煤产计划。
    为了保证完成这一跃进计划，这个局正在努力解决劳动力不足和材料设备不足的问题。例如，在去年以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革命运动的基础上，进一步检查、整顿现有机械化设备，根据需要和可能，把一些土机械向半土半洋发展，把一些半土半洋的机械向洋的方面发展，这将大大提高劳动生产率，节省劳动力。这个局还根据去年大跃进的经验，按比例地通盘安排了各项生产的劳动力，加强了掘进开拓工作，以保证整个生产有节奏地进行。各矿也制订了保证完成计划的具体措施。房山矿为了改进采煤方法，曾在职工中开展大鸣大放大辩论，决定把分段巷道斜坡加大，这样可以节省溜煤用的铁板，节约坑木，提高效率，还能使通风更加良好。各小组工人也订出了小组和个人的保证计划。
    在确定全年生产计划的同时，这个局还提出要力争超额完成第一季度产煤一百三十五万吨的国家计划。现在，全局职工正以冲天干劲，为完成这一计划而实干苦干巧干。
