    An “Ant” in the Vast Sea
    Dong Chao

    This is not a real ant, but the name of a precious island of our motherland. This island is located on the coast of the East China Sea, among the Zhoushan Islands. But you can never find it on a general map, because it is only two square kilometers in area, too small to be drawn on a general map. It is named "Ant" because of its small size. However, there is a legend about it. Two hundred years ago, it was overgrown with weeds and uninhabited. No one knew where it was. Later, a fisherman named Zhou fled from the mainland to this island to fish, so he called it "Catch Island," and gradually people began to live there. During the Kuomintang rule, Catch Island was placed under the jurisdiction of a township office on a nearby large island. The township head was named "Xiehe," and he presumptuously renamed the small island "Xiehe Island." Later, some fishing capitalists from the mainland threatened the islanders in a contemptuous tone: "Humph, your little island, as small as an ant, can be flattened with one foot!" So the name Ant Island spread among the fishermen's suffering and humiliation, and the capitalists' ridicule and exploitation.

    Such a small island, like the mainland before liberation, was also stained with the blood of the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal forces' cruel oppression. At that time, the life of the fishermen on the island was really like that of ants, precarious. A folk song circulated on the island: "Grass roots, dug clean; bitter vegetables, swallowed whole; young children sold to Shenjiamen, young girls sold to Shitouren." This is an accurate portrayal of the life of the fishermen on the island at that time.

    After the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, the fishermen on the island stood up. Although the name Ant Island remained the same, its meaning and content were completely different. Listen to the fishermen singing joyfully: "Little Ant Island, a completely new look, output is increasing year by year, life is getting better every day, motorized sailing boats are built in pairs, communism is coming, thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the poor island has become a golden house." They also sing: "Our life is better than immortals, the Penglai Immortal Island is on Ant Island."

    The fishermen on Ant Island proudly compare their hometown to Penglai Immortal Island and a golden house, which is indeed not an exaggeration. Since liberation, the island's production has been rising in a straight line at a high speed. The total output value in 1957 increased fourteen times compared with 1950. Today, the island is inhabited by 586 households with 2,717 people, with an average of three "thousand yuan" per household: public accumulation averages 1,000 yuan per household, annual net income averages 1,000 yuan per household, and savings and investments average 1,000 yuan per household.

    Ant Island has truly become a treasure island. But the reason it is so rich is because they listened to the Communist Party and organized production. Isn't that what people are singing: "Little Ant Island, following the path of socialism." Since liberation, they have established mutual aid teams and cooperatives. In 1954, they merged the four cooperatives on the island into a large cooperative that combined the island, township, and cooperative. At this time, the township and cooperative were united, and industry, agriculture, fishing, commerce, and military were fully integrated, basically possessing the scale of a people's commune. After Chairman Mao pointed out the benefits of running people's communes, they transformed into formal people's communes, taking the lead in setting up a red flag of people's communes across the country. Today, the total public accumulation of the commune has reached 750,000 yuan, and more than 100 new tile-roofed houses have been built. The commune has a club, a broadcasting station, more than 20 radios, an auditorium, a nursery, and a kindergarten. All school-age children are enrolled in school, and more than 300 people have entered middle schools and spare-time schools. There is not a single illiterate person in the commune.

    The people on Ant Island are all capable people. They are vigorously carrying out technological revolution and are determined to realize the mechanization of fishing within two years. Young men are launching "all-rounder" activities. Most of them can fish at sea and farm on land. Many people are both workers and students, and they have also formed a strong militia. On the small Ant Island, there are many outstanding talents. Representatives from Ant Island also participated in the Second National Congress of Young Activists and the National Women's Congress of Socialist Construction Activists recently held in Beijing!

    大海之中一“蚂蚁”
    董超
    这不是真蚂蚁，而是祖国一个宝岛的名称。这个岛位于东海之滨，舟山群岛之中。但是你在一般地图上绝不能找出它来。因为它方圆只有二平方公里，小得没法画到一般地图上去。它之得名“蚂蚁”，就是因为它小。然而其中还有一段传说，二百年前，那里荒草丛生，渺无人迹，谁也不知道它是什么所在。后来，有个姓周的渔民从大陆逃荒到这岛上捕鱼，于是就把它叫做“捕岛”，从此渐渐有了人烟。到国民党统治年代，捕岛划归附近一个大岛的乡公所管辖。乡长名叫“协和”，他居然狂妄地把这小岛改名为“协和岛”。再后来，大陆上的一些渔业资本家，用轻藐的口气威胁岛上渔民：“哼，你们这个蚂蚁一般的小岛，一脚就可以踩平！”于是蚂蚁岛这名字，就在渔民的苦难和屈辱、资本家的嘲笑和压榨中传了开去。
    这样一个小岛，解放前和大陆一样，也涂满了国民党反动派和封建势力的残酷压迫的血迹。那时候，岛上渔民的生活也真像蚂蚁一样，朝不保夕。岛上流传的一首民歌：“草子根，挖干净；苦连菜，整株吞；小娃卖给沈家门，小娘卖给峙头人。”正是当时岛上渔民生活的确切写照。
    舟山群岛解放以后，岛上渔民站起来了。蚂蚁之名虽依旧，意义和内容却已完全不一样了。你听渔民们欢天喜地地唱着：“小小蚂蚁岛，完全新面貌，产量年年高，生活天天好，机帆船，成对造，共产主义将来到，托毛主席、共产党的福，穷岛变成黄金屋。”又唱道：“我们生活赛神仙，蓬莱仙岛在蚂蚁。”
    蚂蚁岛上渔民们，自豪地把自己的家乡比作蓬莱仙岛，比作黄金屋，确实不算过夸。解放以来，岛上生产一直高速度地直线上升，1957年的总产值比1950年增加十四倍。如今岛上居住着五百八十六户，二千七百十七口人，平均每户都有三个“千元”：公共积累平均每户有一千元，每年纯收益平均每户有一千元，存款、投资平均每户有一千元。
    蚂蚁岛真成了宝岛。但所以这么富有，是他们听共产党的话组织起来生产的缘故。人们不是这样唱着么：“小小蚂蚁岛，跟着社会主义跑。”自从一解放，他们就成立互助组、合作社。1954年将全岛四个合作社并成一岛一乡一社的大社。这时候乡社合一，工农渔商学兵全面结合，基本上具备了人民公社的规模。当毛主席指出了办人民公社的好处后，他们就转为正式的人民公社，在全国带头树起一面人民公社的红旗。如今全社公共积累达七十五万元，还新建了瓦房百余间。社里有俱乐部、广播站、二十多台收音机、大会堂、托儿所、幼儿班。学龄儿童全部入了学，三百多人进了中学和业余学校，全社没有一个文盲。
    蚂蚁岛上的人，全都是能干的人。他们大闹技术革命，决心两年内要实行渔业机帆化。青年小伙子们正在展开“多面手”活动，他们大部分人下海能捕鱼，上岸会种田；不少人既是工人，又是学生，还组成了一支强大的民兵队伍。小小的蚂蚁岛上，出类拔萃的人才很多，最近在北京召开的全国第二次青年积极分子大会和全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子会议，他们也有代表参加哩！
