Qaidam, January 5th (Reported by our newspaper) - The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, relying on its own efforts, has established more than 700 large and small factories in the Gobi Desert of the Qaidam Basin to serve the exploration endeavor.

In the various exploration areas of Qaidam Basin under the jurisdiction of the Petroleum Bureau, one can see slogans such as: "Comprehensive utilization, diversified management, relying on the masses, self-reliance." In the past, all drilling equipment used in the Qaidam Basin was transported from outside, which was neither timely nor efficient in terms of transportation capacity. This time, the workers, based on the principle of self-reliance, first started with machine parts and tools, striving for self-sufficiency. In more than four months, they established more than 100 machine repair and tool manufacturing factories. Currently, they have manufactured drill bits, cranes, pumping units, and many machine parts. Small factories that use crude oil to refine fuel oil are even more common; the kerosene and gasoline needed by major teams, drilling teams, and transportation teams can now be entirely self-supplied. The newly built oxygen plant in Da Qaidan has already been put into production, and the oxygen needed for mechanical repairs no longer needs to be transported from other places through long transportation lines. All major teams are self-smelting iron and steel to solve the needs for pig iron and steel for machine parts manufacturing.

In order to achieve self-reliance in terms of living, all major teams have established many building materials factories, non-staple food processing factories, and clothing and glove factories, etc. Among them, there are more than 40 brick, tile, cement, and lime factories.

Currently, all major teams are building earthen houses to replace tents and mobile homes, using locally sourced and self-made building materials. The meat, non-staple food, work clothes, gloves, etc., needed by the workers can already be partially solved locally. Some teams have also established bakeries to bake bread for workers on field duty.

### 戈壁滩上自力更生柴达木办厂七百座

    戈壁滩上自力更生柴达木办厂七百座
    本报柴达木5日电　青海石油勘探局自力更生，在柴达木盆地的戈壁滩上创办了七百多个为勘探事业服务的大小厂矿。
    在石油局所辖的柴达木各个探区，人们可以看到这样的标语：“综合利用，多种经营，依靠群众，自力更生。”过去，柴达木盆地所用探井设备，完全由外面运去，这样既不及时，又浪费运力。这次，职工们本着自力更生的方针，首先从机器配件和工具方面着手，力求自给。他们在四个多月中办起了一百多个机器修配和工具制造工厂。目前已经制成了钻头、吊车、抽油机和许多机器配件。利用原油炼制燃料油的小厂更是普遍；各大队、井队、运输队需用的煤油和汽油已能全部自给。在大柴旦新建的氧气厂已经投入生产，机械修配所需的氧气，已经不需要经过漫长的运输线从外地运进来了。各大队都自炼钢铁，解决机件制配需要的生铁和钢材。
    为了在生活方面达到自力更生，各大队办起了许多建筑材料厂、副食品加工厂、被服手套厂等，其中，砖瓦、水泥、石灰等厂就有四十多个。
    目前各大队正在修建土房以代替帐篷和活动房屋，用的都是就地取的、自制的建筑材料。职工们的肉食、副食品、工作服、手套等已有部分能就地解决。有的队还设立了面包厂，为野外出勤的职工烤制面包。
