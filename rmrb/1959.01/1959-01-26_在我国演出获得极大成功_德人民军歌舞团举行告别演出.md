Xinhua News Agency, January 25th. The Erich Weinert Song and Dance Troupe of the German Democratic Republic's People's Army held its farewell performance tonight at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing.

    The farewell performance began with the singing of the national anthems of China and Germany in both Chinese and German languages. The song and dance troupe's wonderful performance won wave after wave of long and enthusiastic applause from the audience. Some programs were followed by as many as five curtain calls from the performers. Some programs were even repeated several times. Before the performance began, a farewell ceremony was held. Senior Colonel Li Wei, deputy director of the Propaganda department of the General Political department, and Colonel Josef Schutz, leader of the Erich Weinert Song and Dance Troupe of the German Democratic Republic's People's Army, spoke successively.

    In his speech, Senior Colonel Li Wei first extended warm congratulations on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for the great success of the song and dance troupe's visit and performance in China. He said: "Your song and dance art, with its high ideological content, combativeness, mass character, and unique style, has left an extremely deep impression on the vast number of Chinese audiences. Your visit and performance have enhanced the friendship and mutual understanding between our country and the people and army of the German Democratic Republic, and made valuable contributions to the cultural exchange between the two countries. May our friendship be evergreen like pine and cypress, and flow forever like the Yangtze River and the Rhine River."

    Senior Colonel Li Wei said: "The imperialist bloc's policy of reviving West German militarism poses a serious threat to peace in Europe and the world. We firmly support the German people's struggle against the revival of militarism, for the restoration of German unity, and for the defense of peace in Europe and the world. We firmly believe that the German people's struggle for peaceful reunification, under the strong leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely achieve final victory."

    In his speech, Colonel Josef Schutz first expressed his heartfelt and sincere gratitude for the warm reception he received during his visit and performance in China. He said that through the visit and performance in the past two months, we have conveyed the heartfelt greetings of all the working people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army of the German Democratic Republic to the Chinese people. The primary task of all comrades of our song and dance troupe after returning home is to bring the friendship of the Chinese people to all the people of the German Democratic Republic.

    At the end of the farewell performance, General Fu Zhong, General Zhang Aiping, Deputy Director Luo Jun, Lieutenant General of the Air Force Wang Huiqiu, Rear Admiral of the Navy Duan Dezhang, Major General Wei Chuantong, Senior Colonel Li Wei and others, accompanied by Ambassador Wang Daniel, Deputy Minister Gerhard Weiss, Lieutenant Colonel Fan Yinherd, Colonel Schutz, and Colonel Brandel, head of the song and dance troupe, stepped onto the stage and cordially shook hands with all the comrades of the song and dance troupe to express their gratitude.

    在我国演出获得极大成功
    德人民军歌舞团举行告别演出
    新华社25日讯　德意志民主共和国人民军埃里希·魏纳特歌舞团，今天晚上在北京天桥剧场举行告别演出。
    告别演出在用中、德两国语言唱的中、德两国国歌中开始。歌舞团的精彩演出，博得观众们一次又一次的长时间的热烈鼓掌，有的节目演完后，演员们曾谢幕达五次之多。有些节目还重演了好几次。演出开始前，举行了告别演出仪式。中国人民解放军总政治部宣传部副部长李伟大校和德意志民主共和国人民军埃里希·魏纳特歌舞团领队约瑟夫·舒茨上校先后讲了话。
    李伟大校在讲话中首先代表中国人民解放军全体指战员热烈地祝贺歌舞团在我国的访问演出获得了极大的成功。他说：“你们的具有高度思想性、战斗性、群众性和独特风格的歌舞艺术，给我国广大观众留下了极其深刻的印象。你们的访问和演出，增进了我国同德意志民主共和国人民及其军队之间的友谊和互相了解，对两国之间的文化交流作出了可贵的贡献。让我们的友谊像松柏一样万古长青，像扬子江、莱茵河一样永流不息。”
    李伟大校说：“帝国主义集团复活西德军国主义的政策，使欧洲和全世界的和平事业受到严重威胁。我们坚决支持德国人民反对军国主义复活、争取恢复德国统一、保卫欧洲和世界和平的斗争。我们深信，德国人民争取和平统一的斗争，在德国统一社会党的坚强领导下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，定会取得最后的胜利。”
    约瑟夫·舒茨上校在讲话中首先对在中国访问演出期间受到的热情的接待，表示衷心的诚挚的感谢。他说，通过两个月来的访问演出，我们把德意志民主共和国全体劳动人民和人民军官兵衷心问候转达给了中国人民。我们歌舞团全体同志，回国后的首要任务就是把中国人民的友谊，带给德意志民主共和国全体人民。
    告别演出结束时，傅锺上将、张爱萍上将、罗俊副主任、王辉球空军中将、段德彰海军少将、魏传统少将、李伟大校等由汪戴尔大使、格哈德·魏斯副部长、范因赫德中校、舒茨上校和歌舞团团长布兰德尔上校等陪同登上舞台，同歌舞团全体同志亲切握手致谢。傅锺上将代表中国人民解放军总政治部向歌舞团赠送了锦旗和花篮。
