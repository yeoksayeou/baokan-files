Pioneer Opens the Way for Greater Victories This Year
Power Construction Accelerates Leaps Forward
The First Quarter Will See 700,000 Kilowatts of Power Generating Equipment Put Into Production, More Than 30 Times the Increase Compared to the Same Period Last Year
About Seventy Large Power Stations Will Be Under Construction Simultaneously, and the Progress of Extra-Large Power Station Projects Such as Sanmenxia Will Be Accelerated

(Report from this newspaper) In 1959, China's power industry will leap forward at an even faster pace. According to the plans made by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power based on the progress of various major power station projects, the nation will have approximately 700,000 kilowatts of power generating equipment put into production in the first quarter alone. This figure is equivalent to one-third of the total new power generating equipment capacity added throughout the great leap forward year of 1958, and more than 30 times the amount of power generating equipment put into production during the same period last year.

Many new power station projects planned to begin in 1959 are now actively preparing for construction. More than ten power stations are expected to begin construction in the first quarter. In this way, together with the carry-over projects from 1958, there may be around seventy large power stations under construction simultaneously throughout the country by the end of the first quarter. The ultimate power generation capacity of all these power stations upon completion will be above 100,000 kilowatts.

In order to adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward, this year China's power station construction will still primarily meet the electricity needs of old industrial areas such as the Northeast, North China, and East China. In the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang alone, eight major power generation projects will be put into production in the first quarter, and the new power generating equipment will be equivalent to three-quarters of the total new large and medium-sized power generating equipment capacity added throughout last year. The Nanshi, Wangting, and other power plants in Shanghai are also stepping up their expansion, and it is expected that four new units ranging from 6,000 to 25,000 kilowatts will begin generating electricity before March. All the new and expanded power generation projects in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid system will reap a bumper harvest this year. If equipment can be supplied as scheduled, the Beijing Thermal Power Plant alone will have 150,000 kilowatts of new generators put into production in the first half of the year.

Many extra-large power stations built to meet the long-term needs of the country have also recently taken measures to accelerate the progress of the project. The Xin'an River Hydropower Station, which is planned to generate electricity on October 1 this year, two years ahead of schedule, has seen its employees put forward the goal of completing nearly the same amount of concrete pouring for the dam in the first quarter as they did throughout the entire last year, and strive to begin impounding floodwaters before May 1. After successfully completing the cutoff project, the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub has completed the second-stage cofferdam project ahead of schedule, and has already begun excavating the dam's foundation. This project was originally scheduled to generate electricity in 1962, but now the employees have proposed to guarantee that they will impound floodwaters this year and generate electricity ahead of schedule next year. The construction progress of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, which only started in the second half of last year, is even faster. The entire 668-meter-long diversion tunnel has been completely excavated, and the tunnel's cross-section is currently being expanded. The dam can be built in the second half of the year.

In order to further accelerate the construction of power stations, the workers in various places are continuing to make great efforts in technical revolution and promoting advanced experience on the basis of the brilliant achievements already made in 1958. For example, the rapid installation experience that appeared in Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian, and other places in the second half of last year will be promoted in all power generation projects this year. In this way, a set of generator units that originally required at least one or two months to install may be shortened to a few days or even dozens of hours. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient materials, equipment, and construction machinery, the power industry departments in various places have also made "self-reliance" the main content of this year's power station construction technical revolution. In addition to having established and are establishing many "satellite factories" to manufacture some steel bars, cement, explosives, and construction machinery themselves, they are starting from simplifying the structure of factory buildings and dam bodies, and simplifying supporting equipment, without affecting the quality of the project, so as to avoid or reduce the use of certain materials that the country lacks as much as possible to ensure project progress. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power is also prepared to strengthen the scheduling of equipment and materials this year in accordance with the principle of "ensuring key projects and taking care of general projects" to ensure the needs of key projects.

    先行官为今年更伟大的胜利开路
    电力建设加快跃进步伐
    第一季度将有七十万瓩发电设备投入生产，比去年同期猛增三十多倍
    七十个左右的大型电站将同时施工，三门峡等特大电站工程进度加快
    本报讯  1959年，我国电力工业将以更快的步伐向前跃进。据水利电力部根据各个主要电站工程进度制定的计划，仅在第一季度内全国就将有七十万瓩左右的发电设备投入生产。这个数字相当于大跃进的1958年全年新增发电设备容量的三分之一，比去年同期投入生产的发电设备多了三十多倍。
    许多计划在1959年开工的新的发电站工程，现在也都在积极地进行施工准备工作。有十多个电站预计在第一季度内就能开工。这样，加上1958年的跨年度工程，到第一季度末，全国可以有七十个左右的大型电站同时施工。这些电站全部建成后，最终发电能力都在十万瓩以上。
    为了适应大跃进的形势，今年我国电站建设仍将首先满足东北、华北、华东等老工业地区的用电需要。其中仅东北的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省，第一季度内就有八个大的发电工程投入生产，新增的发电设备等于去年全年新增的大中型发电设备总容量的四分之三，上海市的南市、望亭等电厂也正在加紧扩建，预计在3月以前，还将有四套六千到二万五千瓩的新机组开始发电。京津唐电力网系统各个新建和扩建的发电工程今年都将得到丰收。如设备能如期供应，仅北京热电厂上半年就将有十五万瓩的新发电机投入生产。
    许多为满足国家长远需要而建设的特大型的电站，最近以来也正采取措施加快工程进度。计划提前两年在今年10月1日就要发电的新安江水电站，职工们已经提出要在第一季度内完成接近于去年全年的浇灌大坝混凝土的工作量，争取在5月1日前开始拦洪蓄水。三门峡水利枢纽在胜利完成截流工程后，又提前完成了第二期围堰工程，并已在开挖大坝的坝基。这个工程原定1962年发电，现在职工们提出保证在今年就能拦洪蓄水，明年提前发电。去年下半年才开工的刘家峡水电站的施工进度更快，全长六百六十八公尺的导流隧洞已经全部打通，目前正在扩大隧洞的断面，下半年就可以建筑拦河坝了。
    为了进一步加快电站的建设，目前各地职工还正在1958年已经取得辉煌成就的基础上，继续大闹技术革命和推广先进经验。例如，去年下半年在上海、青岛、大连等地出现的快速安装经验，今年将在所有发电工程中推广。这样，原来需要至少一、二个月才能安装完毕的一套发电机组，就有可能缩短到几天甚至几十小时就完成了。为了解决材料、设备和施工机具等不足的困难，各地电业部门还把“自力更生”作为今年电站建设技术革命的主要内容。他们除了已经建立和正在建立许多“卫星厂”，自己制造一部分钢筋、水泥、炸药、施工机具外，在不影响工程质量的条件下正在从简化厂房和坝体结构、简化配套设备等方面入手，以便尽可能不用或少用国家缺乏的某些器材，保证工程进度。水利电力部也准备在今年要根据“保证重点、照顾一般”的原则，加强设备和器材的调度工作，以保证重点工程的需要。（附图片）
