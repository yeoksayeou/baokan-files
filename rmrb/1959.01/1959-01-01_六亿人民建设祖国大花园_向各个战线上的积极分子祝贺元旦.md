Six Hundred Million People Build the Motherland's Great Garden
—Congratulating Activists on All Fronts for the New Year
	Clear streams and towering mountains, in the East lies a beautiful great garden. Bees and butterflies dance in the garden, with hundreds of flowers blooming in all seasons, and underground treasures of pearls that can never be fully excavated. Here live six hundred million heroic people, whose skills surpass those of the immortals. The strength of six hundred million people surpasses the heavens, determined to rebuild the world. Yesterday, they overthrew the three mountains weighing on their heads, and today they are conquering the vastness of nature. Chairman Mao's call is the signal flare for progress, and six hundred million people share a single direction and a single aspiration. Thunder can be heard for thousands of miles, and the waves of the Great Leap Forward are boundless. Good news flies in from all fronts like snowflakes, with grain and steel leading the way as two marshals. Red molten steel flows like rivers, and long railways are built up to the ninth heaven. One after another, high-yield satellites are reported across the land, and piles of grain and gold are higher than Mount Tai. New champions emerge in the millions in every field, and everyone uses actions to write heroic poems. The sun rises, and the ground is covered in red, and the great fire of the communes ignites the hearts of the people. With one heart and one mind, they build an ideal paradise, using divine brushes and colorful paints to adorn the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland. Grass, trees, sand, and stones all contribute light and heat, and birds, beasts, insects, and fish also dance gracefully. The springs of happiness flow endlessly, and the beautiful pictures are never finished. Who doesn't love living in the Mao Zedong era? Even white-bearded old men are turning into youths. The blind open their eyes to see the new world, and the mute open their mouths to spread miracles. The drums and firecrackers of victory shake the sky, and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl also come to the world for reunion. Has humanity ever seen such brilliance? Chinese sons and daughters display boundless wisdom and courage. The journey of the Long March is still far away, and our steps cannot slow down. New combat missions come one after another, and the red flag of the Leap Forward flutters in the front, beckoning. People treat night as day, wearing the moon and stars to seize time. Who says time runs fast? The new Kuafu runs ahead of time. Piece by piece of stone, piece by piece of brick, ten thousand feet of tall buildings are built from the ground. Piece by piece of stone, piece by piece of brick, each brick and stone is a springboard for advancement. The eyes of the people of the world are watching us, and China's victory strengthens the lever of world peace. Friends from all over the world stand with us, and our breathing is closely connected. Red divine eagles soar in the sky day and night, guarding the gates and gardens of the motherland. Even if those warmongers clamor and go mad, if wild beasts break into the garden, we will break their legs. Steadily sitting on the socialist ship, moving forward, following the Party, we are not afraid of storms. Holding high the red flag of battle, forever forward, not afraid of breaking through thousands of obstacles. Clear streams and towering mountains, six hundred million people are building the motherland's great garden. Clear streams and blue skies, six hundred million people are defending the motherland's beautiful rivers and mountains.

    六亿人民建设祖国大花园
    ——向各个战线上的积极分子祝贺元旦
    海棱清清的流水呀高高的山，东方有一座美丽的大花园。园里蜂飞蝶舞四季百花鲜，地下珍珠宝藏天天挖不完。这里住着六亿英雄人民，英雄人民的本领赛过神仙。六亿人民的力量胜过天，立志要把天地来重建。昨天推倒头上的三座山，今天要征服莽莽大自然。毛主席的号召是前进的信号弹，六亿人民一个方向一个心愿。千里的雷声万里的闪，大跃进的波涛望不到边。各条战线飞来喜报像雪片，粮食钢铁两个元帅走在先。红红的钢水呀流成河，长长的铁路修上九重天。一个个丰产卫星天下传，一堆堆粮食黄金高过泰山。行行涌现万万千千的新状元，人人都用行动写下英雄诗篇。太阳出来满地红艳艳，公社的巨火把人心齐点燃。万众一心建造理想乐园，神笔彩绘点染祖国好河山。草木沙石都献出光和热，鸟兽虫鱼也起舞翩翩。幸福的泉水呀流不尽，美好的图画画不完。活在毛泽东时代谁不喜欢，白胡子老汉也变成青年。瞎子睁眼要看新世面，哑吧开口争把奇迹传。胜利的锣鼓鞭炮震动天，牛郎织女也到人间来团圆。人类几曾有过这般光辉灿烂，中华儿女表现出无限的智慧勇敢。万里长征路程还遥远，我们的脚步一步也不能慢。新的战斗任务一个接着一个，跃进的红旗在前面迎风招展。人们把夜晚当白天，戴月披星夺取时间。谁说时间跑得快，新的夸父跑在时间最前面。一块块石头一块块砖，万丈高楼从平地建。一块块石头一块块砖，每一块砖石都是前进的跳板。全世界人民的眼睛望着我们，中国的胜利加强世界和平的杠杆。四海的朋友同我们站在一起，我们的呼吸紧紧相连。红色的神鹰昼夜在天空盘旋，守卫着祖国的大门和花园。那怕那战争狂人叫嚣发疯癫，野兽闯进花园就把它腿打断。稳坐着社会主义的大船向前，跟着党就不怕风浪滔天。高举战斗的红旗永远向前，不怕冲破千道万道关。清清的流水呀高高的山，六亿人民在建设祖国大花园。清清的流水呀蓝蓝的天，六亿人民保卫祖国好江山。
