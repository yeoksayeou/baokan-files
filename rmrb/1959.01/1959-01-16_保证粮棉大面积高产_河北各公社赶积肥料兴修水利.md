    To Guarantee High Yields of Grain and Cotton on Large Areas
    Hebei Communes Rush to Accumulate Fertilizer and Build Water Conservancy Projects
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 15th) More than 900 people's communes in Hebei Province are launching a large-scale high-yield field movement to ensure the realization of increased production plans for grain, cotton, and oil crops, and strive for even greater harvests this year.
    The large-scale high-yield field movement in Hebei Province began with wheat planting. Currently, winter management such as watering with urine, pressing sand, covering with fertilizer, and harrowing wheat fields is underway. According to the latest statistics from the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the people's communes in five wheat-producing regions have cultivated more than 11,829,000 mu of large-scale high-yield wheat fields, accounting for about one-third of the province's wheat acreage. To manage these wheat fields well, the people's communes in these areas have drawn more than 2 million Party members, Youth League members, militia members, activists, and experienced veteran farmers to establish more than 25,000 specialized teams mainly to manage large-scale high-yield wheat fields, taking responsibility for management from planting to harvesting. Due to clear division of labor and fixed responsibilities, field management of these high-yield fields is also timely. As early as before the freeze, about 80% of the wheat fields were watered once or twice and fertilized once or twice; on average, more than 7,000 jin of fertilizer were added per mu in conjunction with watering. Now that the ground is frozen, the specialized teams are carrying out management activities such as watering with urine, irrigating with diluted manure, covering with manure and soil, and harrowing wheat fields to keep the soil moist and warm.
    The large-scale high-yield field movement for spring-sown crops is also rapidly unfolding while being planned. At present, various localities are combining the processes of defining land, assigning people, setting yields, and appointing leaders to vigorously attack the three key areas of water, fertilizer, and soil. The Provincial Party Committee's plan for 13 million mu of high-yield spring-sown crop fields has been implemented in communes and teams. According to statistics from fourteen counties and cities in the three regions of Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Baoding, more than 2.3 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields have been planned, and more than 340,000 specialized team members have been organized. Furthermore, various field projects are being carried out while planning. Before the freeze, people's communes in various localities doubled the deep plowing and layered fertilization, focusing on high-yield fields. By the end of December last year, 8 million mu of high-yield fields had been generally deep plowed to more than one and a half chi, and more than 5.5 million mu had been fertilized at the bottom. While deep plowing, people's communes also actively carried out farmland water conservancy to create water conservancy conditions for large-scale high-yield fields. At present, more than 230,000 people in the province are digging machine wells, and more than 680,000 people are building reservoirs, river networks, and canals. Because the land is frozen, the focus of the large-scale high-yield movement has gradually shifted to accumulating and producing fertilizer. Many communes have built pig farms and indigenous fertilizer plants in the large-scale high-yield fields, and specialized teams for high-yield wheat and spring-sown crops have also shifted to accumulating fertilizer. The labor force participating in accumulating and producing fertilizer throughout the province has increased by 430,000 compared to half a month ago, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated is currently increasing at a rate of more than 9 billion jin per day. After nearly two months of concentrated effort, significant achievements have been made in the water, fertilizer, and soil preparation work for large-scale high-yield fields. According to inspections by various communes in the Chengde region, among the 1 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields, more than 660,000 mu have met the required standards for deep plowing; 507,000 mu have drilled machine wells and opened canals, providing water conservancy conditions for drought resistance and guaranteed harvests; more than 150,000 mu of sloping land have been leveled to become terraced fields; and all high-yield fields have accumulated an average of about 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.
    To ensure the realization of the increased production plan for high-yield fields, the high-yield specialized teams of people's communes in many areas are running spare-time Red and Expert technical schools and establishing scientific research organizations, learning various high-yield technologies in conjunction with current production activities. According to incomplete statistics from the Tianjin and Tangshan regions, there are currently more than 13,000 Red and Expert technical schools, with a total enrollment of more than 1.6 million laborers. People's communes in eleven counties and cities, including Yongnian and Shulu in the Handan and Shijiazhuang regions, have established more than 4,000 scientific research organizations, organizing more than 40,000 people to participate in research on increasing production of water, fertilizer, soil, and various crops. The scientific research organization of the Maitian High-Yield Team of Dabeiwang People's Commune in Yongnian County, based on the new situation of close planting, created more than 700 new tools such as close planting cultivators, animal-drawn diluted manure carts, and lightweight fertilizer delivery carts in the management of wheat fields.
    Party and government leading organs at all levels in Hebei Province attach great importance to the large-scale high-yield field movement of people's communes. Party committees at all levels regard the large-scale high-yield field movement of people's communes as a political task, include it on the agenda, and conduct regular discussions and inspections. Furthermore, they designate a considerable number of secretaries and committee members to take charge and establish specialized leadership organizations. The Party Committee of the eight counties in the Chengde region has drawn 24 secretaries and committee members to lead the high-yield movement; 89 people's communes have also drawn 150 secretaries or commune directors to serve as the general commanders of large-scale high-yield fields. The Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Chengde Prefectural Committees also held specialized meetings to study the organizational leadership and technical measures of the large-scale high-yield field movement, and formulated technical regulations in accordance with local conditions, clarifying the methods for achieving high yields. Many local Party organizations have also established Party and Youth League organizations and political work systems in the large-scale high-yield field specialized teams, organized timely debates, and used methods such as criticism and self-criticism to help commune members resolve ideological understanding problems in the large-scale high-yield movement, promoting the in-depth development of the movement.

    保证粮棉大面积高产
    河北各公社赶积肥料兴修水利
    本报天津15日电　河北省九百多个人民公社正在开展大面积高产田运动，保证实现粮、棉、油料的增产计划，力争今年更大的丰收。
    河北省的大面积高额丰产田运动是从种麦开始的。目前正在进行浇尿、压沙、盖肥和耙压麦田等越冬管理。据省统计局最近的统计，五个产麦专区的人民公社，共培养了大面积高额丰产麦田一千一百八十二万九千多亩，约占全省麦田面积的三分之一。为把这些麦田管好，这些地区的人民公社共抽出党团员、民兵、积极分子和有生产经验的老农二百多万人，建立了两万五千多个以管理大面积高额丰产麦田为主的专业队，从种到收，包干管理。由于分工明确，责任固定，这些高额丰产田的田间管理也很及时。早在封冻前，即有80％左右的麦田浇了一、两次水，追了一、两次肥；结合浇水平均每亩追加了七千多斤肥料。目前地已封冻，专业队正在进行浇尿、灌稀粪、盖粪蒙土和耙压麦田等管理活动，使麦田保墒保温。
    春播作物的大面积高额丰产田运动，也在边规划边行动地迅速开展，目前各地正结合着定地、定人、定产量、定领导，猛攻水、肥、土三关。省委制定的一千三百万亩春播作物高产田的计划，已经贯彻到社、队。据承德、张家口、保定三个专区十四个县市的统计，已规划好大面积高额丰产田二百三十多万亩，组织起专业队三十四万多人。并且边规划、边行动，进行各种田间工程。封冻前各地人民公社在耕翻地当中，曾以高额丰产田为重点加倍深翻和分层施肥。截至去年12月底，已有八百万亩高额丰产田普遍深翻到一尺半以上，五百五十多万亩施上了底肥，在深翻地的同时，各人民公社还积极开展农田水利，为大面积高额丰产田创造水利条件。目前全省有二十三万多人打机井、六十八万多人修建水库、河网和渠道。因为土地封冻，大面积高额丰产运动的重点，目前已逐渐转向积肥造肥。许多社在大面积高额丰产田里修建了猪场和土化肥场，小麦和春播作物高产田专业队也转向了积肥。全省参加积肥造肥的劳力，较半月前增加了四十三万人，积肥的数量目前正以日积九十多亿斤的进度继续增加。经过近两个月的突击，大面积高额丰产田的水、肥、土各项准备工作，已获得很大成绩。据承德专区各社检查，一百万亩大面积高额丰产田当中，已有六十六万多亩达到了深翻的要求标准；五十万七千亩打了机井开了渠，有了抗旱保收的水利条件；十五万多亩坡地经过平整已达到水平梯田化；所有的高产田，平均每亩已积出万斤左右的肥料。
    为保证实现高产田的增产计划，许多地区人民公社的高产专业队结合着当前生产活动，大办业余红专技术学校和建立科学研究组织，学习各项高产技术。据天津、唐山专区的不完全统计，目前红专技术学校即达一万三千多所，入学的劳力共达一百六十多万人。邯郸、石家庄专区的永年、束鹿等十一个县市的人民公社即建立科学研究组织四千多处，组织起四万多人参加水、肥、土和各种作物的增产研究。永年县大北旺人民公社麦田丰产方的科学研究组织在麦田管理当中，根据密植的新情况，创造出密植中耕器、畜拉稀粪车和轻便送肥车等七百多件新工具。
    河北省各级党政领导机关对人民公社的大面积高额丰产运动非常重视。各级党委都把人民公社的大面积高额丰产运动当成一项政治任务，列入议事日程，定期的讨论检查。并且指定相当数目的书记、委员挂帅，建立专门的领导组织。承德专区八个县的党委即抽出了二十四名书记、委员，领导高产运动；八十九个人民公社，也抽出一百五十名书记或社主任当大面积高额丰产田的总指挥。邯郸、石家庄、承德地委，还召开了专门的会议，研究了大面积高产田运动的组织领导和技术措施，并因地制宜地订出了技术规程，明确实现高额丰产的办法。许多地区的党组织，还在大面积高产田专业队当中，建立了党团组织和政治工作制度，及时组织辩论，并用批评和自我批评等方式，帮助社员群众解决大面积高额丰产运动中的思想认识问题，推动运动深入开展。
