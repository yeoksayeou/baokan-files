Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: This reporter reports: In the three years from the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the upcoming 21st Congress, the entire Soviet industry has shown a vigorous and soaring atmosphere. Statistics show that in the past three years, the level of Soviet industrial production has increased by about more than one-third compared with 1955, and an average of more than two new large industrial enterprises have been completed and put into production every day throughout the country. During this period, the leadership of Soviet industry and construction has been greatly strengthened, and the geographical distribution of national industrial production has changed.

　New Enterprises Rise, Industrial Output Increases
　　The past three years will be recorded in the history of the Soviet state as a period of new and great achievements in Soviet industrial production and construction. According to Soviet newspapers, in the past three years, the total investment in capital construction of the Soviet national economy amounted to approximately 630 billion rubles, equivalent to 1.7 times the total investment in capital construction of the Soviet Union during the pre-war several five-year plans. In just three years, more than 2,500 large industrial enterprises have been built throughout the country; many existing factories and mines have also been expanded and renovated. The entire Soviet heavy industry has accelerated its development in the past three years. In some industrial sectors of decisive significance, the production capacity put into production in recent years far exceeds the total production capacity of these industrial sectors before the war. Due to the successive construction of new enterprises and the continuous improvement of the production level of existing enterprises, Soviet industrial production has continued to rise in the past three years. Taking the most important industrial products, in the past three years, the Soviet Union's steel and pig iron, steel products, and electricity have increased by one-fifth to more than one-third, coal mining has increased by 105 million tons, and various important products of the machine manufacturing industry have increased by several tens of percent or even several times. Due to a series of measures taken in the past few years based on the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the production of industrial sectors such as petroleum, gas, building materials, and chemicals has achieved very rapid development. Compared with 1955, last year the Soviet Union's oil and gas production increased by 60% and two times respectively. The production of light industry and the food industry has also increased.

　Leadership Methods Improved, Production Speed Accelerated
　　One of the important signs of Soviet industrial development in the past three years is that the forms and methods of leadership have been further improved. According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU, from the second half of 1957, the Soviet Union implemented the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, dividing the country into 104 economic administrative regions, and establishing National Economic Committees according to economic regions. According to the plan, the Soviet Union reduced many management agencies originally established by various specialized departments of the government for vertical leadership, and the National Economic Committees directly led the enterprises in various regions. In the short period after the reorganization, the superiority of the new form of industrial management has been demonstrated. The leadership is closer to production and helps to solve problems in production, the initiative and enthusiasm of workers and engineering and technical personnel have been improved, the speed of industrial product growth has been accelerated, the situation of tapping inherent production potential has been greatly improved, and the socialist competition for striving to complete the national plan has been more widely developed. In the first year after the reorganization (July 1957 to June 1958), the total value of industrial production increased by 17 billion rubles compared with the previous year. The new form of industrial management provides broad opportunities for further developing the specialization and collaboration of various economic regions and within various republics, as well as the entire national economy.

　Accelerate the Development of the East, Rationally Allocate Production
　　At the same time, great changes have also taken place in the geographical distribution of Soviet industrial production in the past few years. According to the policy of the 20th Congress of the CPSU to accelerate the development of industry in the eastern region, in terms of power industry, the Irkutsk and Novosibirsk hydroelectric power stations were built in the eastern region during this period, and the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric power stations, Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk hydroelectric power stations, began. New industrial enterprises have also begun to appear in their vicinity. At the same time, some giant thermal power stations have also been built or are being built on the coal mine bases in Siberia and Kazakhstan. The Central Siberian Unified Power Grid has also begun construction. In terms of the metallurgical industry, according to the instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the construction of the third iron and steel industrial base in the Soviet Union, two giant enterprises, the Karaganda Iron and Steel Joint Factory and the West Siberian Iron and Steel Joint Factory, are being established in Kazakhstan and Siberia. On the original second iron and steel industrial base, the production capacity of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Joint Factory has also been greatly expanded. In addition, the machine manufacturing industry has also achieved high-speed development. In the Central Asian republics, some new gas and chemical industrial centers of all-Soviet significance have also begun to appear.

　　In the European part of the Soviet Union, the allocation of productive forces has become more rational in the past three years. In order to supply the raw materials needed by the highly developed steel industry, large-scale iron ore mining has been launched in the famous Kursk and Krivoy Rog iron ore areas. In the past three years, ten new giant blast furnaces have been built in the well-known Donets-Dnieperovsk industrial zone. During the same period, new oil and natural gas producing areas were discovered in many areas, and new gas, oil, and chemical industrial centers have begun to be built.

　　Due to the further development of industry and other national economic sectors, the European part of the Soviet Union once felt a shortage of electricity. Now, due to the construction of the Lenin Volga Hydroelectric Station, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, and many other power stations, as well as the construction of the unified power grid in the European part of the Soviet Union, this problem has been solved.

　Win the Peaceful Competition, Surpassing the United States is Not Difficult
　　The great surge of Soviet industry in the past few years has further strengthened the Soviet Union's economic strength, and at the same time, has enabled the Soviet Union to win new victories in the peaceful competition with the United States. In the past three years, Soviet industrial production has increased by 10% to 11% annually, while the United States' industrial production only increased by about 3% in 1956, did not increase in 1957, and decreased by about 7% last year. Compared with 1955, preliminary statistics show that the United States' industrial production index fell by five points last year, that is, from 139 in 1955 to 134 (with the average of 1947-1949 as 100). In this way, Soviet industrial production is further approaching the level of the United States, whether in terms of total output value or in the output of some products. In addition to already surpassing the United States in the industrial output of combine harvesters, sugar, timber harvesting, peat, manganese, and chromium, the Soviet Union has also caught up with and surpassed the United States in the total output of reinforced concrete components, wool fabrics, and coal in the past three years.

    两次党代表大会期间工业生产蓬勃高涨
    苏联工业水平三年来步步高升
    平均每天有两个以上新的大企业建成和投入生产
    新华社19日讯　本社记者报道：在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会到即将召开的第二十一次代表大会的三年间，苏联整个工业呈现出蓬勃高涨的气象。统计材料表明，在过去三年中，苏联工业生产水平大约比1955年提高了三分之一以上，全国平均每天有两个以上新的大工业企业建成和投入生产。在这期间，苏联工业和建筑业的领导工作大大加强了，全国工业生产的地理配置有了变化。
  新的企业崛起　工业产量激增
    过去三年将作为苏联工业生产和建设工作获得新的巨大成就的时期载入苏维埃国家的史册。据苏联报纸报道，在过去三年中，苏联国民经济基本建设投资总额约达六千三百亿卢布，等于战前几个五年计划期间苏联基本建设投资总和的一点七倍。在短短三年中，全国就建成了两千五百多个大型工业企业；原有的许多工厂和矿山也进行了扩建和改建。整个苏联重工业在三年中加速地发展了。在一些具有决定意义的工业部门中，最近几年投入生产的生产能力就远远超过了战前这些工业部门的全部生产能力。由于新企业相继建设起来和原有企业的生产水平不断提高，苏联工业生产在过去三年中继续上升。拿各种最重要的工业产品来说，过去三年间，苏联的钢和生铁、钢材、电力增加了五分之一到三分之一还多，采煤量则增加了一亿零五百万吨，机器制造工业的各种重要产品也分别增加了百分之几十甚至好几倍。由于过去几年根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议采取了一系列措施，石油、瓦斯、建筑材料和化学等工业部门的生产获得了十分迅速的发展。和1955年比较，去年苏联石油和瓦斯产量就分别增加了60％和两倍。轻工业和食品工业的生产也增加了。
  领导方法改进　生产速度加快
    过去三年苏联工业发展的重要标志之一是，领导形式和方法有了进一步的改进。根据苏共中央的决议，从1957年下半年起，苏联实行了工业和建筑业管理的改组，全国划分成一百零四个经济行政区，并且按经济区成立了国民经济委员会。按照计划，苏联裁减了原先由政府各专门部进行垂直领导时所设立的许多管理机构，而由国民经济委员会对各地的企业进行直接领导。在改组后的短短时期内，新的工业管理形式的优越性已经表现出来。领导更加接近于生产，并有助于解决生产中的问题，工人和工程技术人员的主动性和积极性提高了，工业产品增长的速度加快了，发掘内在的生产潜力的情况大大改善了，为争取完成国家计划的社会主义竞赛有了更广泛的发展。在改组后的头一年（1957年7月到1958年6月），工业生产总值比前一年增加了一百七十亿卢布。新的工业管理形式，为进一步发展各经济区和各共和国内部以及整个国民经济的专业化和协作，提供了广泛的机会。
  加速开发东部　合理配置生产
    和这同时，过去几年苏联工业生产的地理配置也发生了很大变化。根据苏共第二十次代表大会加速发展东部地区工业的方针，在动力工业方面，这一时期东部地区建成了伊尔库次克和新西伯利亚水电站，并开始建设世界上最大的水电站——克拉斯诺雅尔斯克和布拉次克水电站。新的工业企业也开始在它们的附近出现了。同时，在西伯利亚和哈萨克的煤矿基地上，还建成或正在建设一些巨型的火力发电站。中西伯利亚统一动力网也开始建设了。在冶金工业方面，按照苏共第二十次代表大会关于建设苏联第三个钢铁工业基地的指示，两个巨型企业——卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂和西西伯利亚钢铁联合工厂正在哈萨克和西伯利亚建立起来。在原有的第二个钢铁工业基地上，库兹?茨克钢铁联合工厂的生产能力也大大扩大了。此外，机器制造工业也获得了高速度的发展。在中亚细亚各加盟共和国，也开始出现了一些有全苏意义的新的瓦斯和化学工业中心。
    在苏联欧洲部分地区，过去三年生产力配置也更加合理。为了供应高度发展的钢铁工业所需要的原料，著名的库尔斯克和克里沃罗格铁矿区已经展开了大规模的铁矿开采。三年来，有名的顿?茨—第聂伯罗夫斯克工业区又建成了十座新的巨型高炉。在同一时期，许多地区还发现了新的石油和天然瓦斯产地，并且已经开始建设起新的瓦斯、石油和化学工业中心。
    由于工业和其他国民经济部门的进一步发展，苏联欧洲部分地区过去曾感到电力不足。现在，由于列宁伏尔加水电站、斯大林格勒水电站和其他许多电力站的建成，以及苏联欧洲部分统一动力网的建设，这个问题已经得到解决。
  和平竞赛获胜　超过美国不难
    过去几年苏联工业的巨大高涨进一步加强了苏联的经济力量，同时，使苏联在同美国进行的和平竞赛中赢得了新的胜利。在过去三年中，苏联工业生产每年增加10％到11％，然而美国的工业生产只在1956年增加了约3％，1957年没有增加，去年则减少了约7％。同1955年比较，去年美国工业生产指数据初步统计下降了五点，即从1955年的一百三十九下降到一百三十四（以1947—1949年的平均数为一百）。这样，就使苏联工业生产无论在总产值方面或者在一些产品的产量方面进一步接近美国的水平。除了在联合机、糖、木材采伐量、泥炭、锰、铬等工业产量上早已超过美国外，过去三年苏联又先后在钢筋混凝土构件、毛织品和煤的总产量上赶上和超过了美国。
