Xinhua News Agency report: The victory of the Cuban people's struggle against dictatorship has had a tremendous impact in Latin America. In the two Latin American countries currently ruled by dictators—Paraguay and the Dominican Republic—signs of instability have appeared in the dictatorial regimes.

From Asunción, Paraguay, news of internal instability in the Stroessner regime and repressive measures taken by the dictator are constantly being reported.

The Argentine newspaper "La Nación," published on the 14th, quoted sources from Asunción as saying that a military "rebellion" had occurred in the Chaco region of Paraguay. General Granno, head of the Paraguayan military school, General Ofando, leader of the military air force, and more than two hundred other officers have been arrested.

The newspaper also said that after the fall of the Cuban dictator, the Paraguayan dictator took "precautionary measures," as a result of which hundreds of people have been arrested.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Buenos Aires on the 17th, "News of disturbances has been constantly coming from Paraguay recently. Despite official denials, these reports insist that discord has occurred among military leaders and friction has developed within the ruling National Republican Association. Stroessner has been able to maintain power only with the support of these two forces."

The situation is the same in the Dominican Republic. The Cuban newspaper "Diario Nacional" reported on the 22nd on its front page the news of instability in the rule of Dominican dictator Trujillo. The newspaper said that the Dominican government recently uncovered a plan to overthrow Trujillo's dictatorship, and those involved in the plan were arrested. Rear Admiral Richardson, the former head of the Dominican Navy, was dismissed two weeks ago and sentenced to five years in prison.

The newspaper also said that discontent with the dictatorship is growing in the Dominican Navy and Air Force, and ten Air Force officers have recently been arrested as a result.

    古巴的凯歌鼓舞了邻国人民
    巴拉圭和多米尼加独裁政权不稳
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：古巴人民反独裁斗争的胜利在拉丁美洲发生了巨大的影响。在目前拉丁美洲由独裁者统治的两个国家——巴拉圭和多米尼加，独裁统治都出现了不稳的迹象。
    从巴拉圭的亚松森，最近不断传出斯特罗斯纳政权内部不稳和独裁者采取镇压措施的消息。
    14日出版的阿根廷“民族报”引用亚松森的消息说，在巴拉圭的查科地区发生了军事“叛乱”。巴拉圭军事学校校长格兰诺将军、军事航空队领袖奥范多将军和其他二百多个军官已被逮捕。
    这家报纸还说，在古巴独裁者垮台以后，巴拉圭独裁者就采取了“预防措施”，因此而被捕的已有数百人。
  据美联社17日从布宜诺斯艾利斯发出的消息说，
  “近来不断从巴拉圭传出骚乱的消息。尽管官方加以否认，这些消息却坚持说，在军事领袖中间发生了不和，在执政的国家共和党内部发生了摩擦。斯特罗斯纳得以保持政权，就靠这两个力量的支持。”
    在多米尼加，情况也是一样。古巴“国民日报”22日在第一版报道了多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略统治不稳的消息。这家报纸说，多米尼加政府最近破获了一项推翻特鲁希略独裁统治的计划，参加这项计划的人被逮捕。多米尼加前海军首脑理查逊海军上将已经在两星期以前被革职，并被判处五年徒刑。
    这家报纸还说，多米尼加海军和空军中对独裁统治的不满情绪在增长，最近有十名空军军官因此被捕。
