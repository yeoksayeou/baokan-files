Cultivating workers to serve as teachers and establishing a contingent of worker-teachers is an important method to ensure the continuous development, consolidation, and improvement of workers' spare-time education.

Since the Great Leap Forward in production, workers' spare-time education in factories has greatly developed. To run these workers' schools well, the problem of teachers must be solved. However, to solve the problem of teachers, in addition to assigning full-time teachers and hiring engineering and technical personnel as part-time teachers, it is also necessary to cultivate a contingent of worker-teachers. Generally speaking, the characteristics of worker-teachers are that they have rich production experience and understand the life and learning needs of workers; however, their educational level is not very high, and they lack teaching experience. The responsibility of leaders is to continuously promote the advantages of worker-teachers and do everything possible to help them improve themselves. Various districts in Tianjin have established spare-time normal schools or teacher training colleges, transferring a large number of worker-teachers to conduct long-term systematic study and short-term training, effectively improving the cultural, scientific knowledge, and teaching ability of worker-teachers. Their experience is worth paying attention to by various regions.

    培养工人担任教师
    积极培养工人担任教师，建立工人教师队伍，是保证职工业余教育不断发展、巩固和提高的一个重要办法。
    生产大跃进以来，工厂职工业余教育有了很大的发展。要办好这些职工学校，必须解决师资问题。但是，要解决师资问题，除了调配专职教师和聘请工程技术人员担任兼职教师外，还需要培养一支工人教师队伍。一般地说，工人教师的特点是，他们有丰富的生产经验，了解工人的生活和学习要求；但他们的文化程度还不很高，缺乏教学经验。领导者的责任，就是要不断发扬工人教师的优点，尽一切办法帮助他们提高自己。天津各区举办业余师范学校或教师进修学院，抽调大批工人教师，进行长期系统学习和短期训练，有效地提高了工人教师的文化科学知识和教学能力。他们的经验值得各地重视。
