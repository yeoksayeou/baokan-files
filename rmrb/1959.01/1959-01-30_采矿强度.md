    Mining Intensity

    Mining intensity is a comprehensive indicator for measuring the results of production technology activities in black metal mines. For open-pit mining, it refers to the amount of iron ore produced per meter of bench working line in a month; for underground mining, it refers to the amount of iron ore produced per square meter of the mining face in a month. Therefore, mining intensity reflects the comprehensive results of production equipment, production management, and technical activities.
    If the mining intensity of all large-scale open-pit iron mines across the country in 1959 were raised to 400 tons like the Nanfen Iron Mine, then more than 14 million tons of iron ore could be produced for the country without spending state investment or increasing equipment.

    采矿强度
    采矿强度是衡量黑色矿山生产技术活动成果的一个综合性指标。对于露天采矿来说，那就是在一个月中，每一公尺台阶工作线长度所生产出的铁矿石数量；对于坑下采矿来说，那就是采矿掌子面在一月内每一平方公尺所生产出的铁矿石数量。所以，采矿强度反映了生产设备、生产管理和技术活动的综合成果。
    1959年全国各大型露天铁矿的采矿强度，如果都像南芬铁矿一样提高到四百吨，那么就可以在不花国家投资、不增加设备的条件下，为国家多生产铁矿石一千四百万吨以上。
