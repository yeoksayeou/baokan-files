Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Cairo. News: The radio stations and newspapers of the United Arab Republic in Cairo and Damascus have recently been concentrating their efforts on promoting "Arab unity" while fiercely attacking the Syrian Communist Party and the "leftists" of other Arab countries.

The Cairo "Voice of the Arabs" radio station, in a commentary on December 26, emphasized that Arab unity means uniting all Arab countries into one country. It said: "That homeland stretching from the Arabian Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean, when it is unified, united, and handles its needs as a free, unified, and united nation, it will realize all its wishes." In a commentary on the 27th, the same radio station said that Arab nationalism "stipulates that free Arabs enjoy the wealth of their entire homeland, without distinguishing between this region and that region." The Damascus "Voice of the Arabs" newspaper also said that Arab nationalism is to serve "the unification of Arabs into a great power." These radio stations and newspapers attacked the Syrian Communist Party and other Arab countries' "leftists" for opposing "Arab unity." The United Arab Republic Radio said in a broadcast on December 29 that "not all those who attempt to undermine Arab unity are Israelis, some communist extremists also do not cherish Arab unity." The Damascus "Victory" newspaper published a commentary on the 28th saying: "The Syrian Communist Party opposes unity," "Anyone who opposes unity is a supporter of division." The Damascus Radio, in a commentary on December 17, said that neither the left nor the right wants Arab unity, "the left may become more dangerous because it disguises itself with the slogans of democracy and freedom." The Damascus "Voice of the Arabs" newspaper declared on December 13 that supporters of opposing Arab unity "have begun to raise their heads in some Arab countries, and even fiercely attack Arab nationalism." Cairo Radio, in a broadcast on December 15, addressed the people of Iraq: "You are still standing at the crossroads, on your right is imperialism, and on your left is also imperialism."

The newspapers in Cairo and Damascus also published Western articles and news attacking Iraq. The Cairo "Al-Akhbar" published on December 27 news disseminated by many Western news agencies that the Iraqi government had arrested "many nationalists" and that Iraqi communists "oppose all Arab nationalist movements." The Cairo "Al-Ahram" also used American news agency reports opposing Iraq. Some newspapers in Cairo and Damascus also published articles by American columnist Joseph Alsop attacking the Iraqi government as a so-called "communist regime."

    继续攻击叙共和阿拉伯国家“左派”
    新华社3日讯　开罗消息：阿拉伯联合共和国开罗和大马士革的电台和报纸最近在集中力量宣传“阿拉伯统一”的时候，猛烈攻击叙利亚共产党和其他阿拉伯国家的“左派”。
    开罗阿拉伯之声广播电台在12月26日的评论中，强调阿拉伯的统一就是要把所有阿拉伯国家统一成为一个国家。它说：“那从阿拉伯湾伸展到大西洋的祖国，当它统一、团结和作为一个自由、统一和团结的国家来处理它的需求的时候，它就实现了它的全部愿望。”同一电台在27日的评论中说：阿拉伯民族主义“规定自由阿拉伯人享有他们整个祖国的财富，没有这一地区和那一地区之分”。大马士革阿拉伯之声报也说，阿拉伯民族主义是要为“把阿拉伯联合成为一个大国而服务”。这些电台和报纸的评论攻击叙利亚共产党和其他阿拉伯国家的“左派”反对“阿拉伯统一”。阿拉伯联合共和国电台在12月29日的广播中说，“企图破坏阿拉伯统一的也不全都是以色列人，一些共产主义极端分子也不珍惜阿拉伯统一”。大马士革胜利报在28日发表评论说：“叙利亚共产党反对统一”，“任何反对统一的人都是分裂的支持者”。大马士革电台在12月17日发表评论说，左派和右派都不希望阿拉伯统一，“左派由于以民主和自由的口号伪装自己”，“可能变得更危险”。大马士革阿拉伯之声报在12月13日宣称：反对阿拉伯统一的支持者“开始在某些阿拉伯国家中抬头，甚至于猛烈地攻击阿拉伯民族主义”。开罗电台在12月15日的广播中对伊拉克人民提出：“你们还站在十字路口，你们的右边是帝国主义，你们的左边也是帝国主义。”
    开罗和大马士革的报纸还刊登了西方攻击伊拉克的文章和新闻。12月27日的开罗消息报发表了许多西方通讯社所散布的伊拉克政府逮捕“很多民族主义者”和伊拉克共产党“反对一切阿拉伯民族主义运动”的新闻。开罗金字塔报也刊用了美国通讯社反对伊拉克的消息。开罗和大马士革的一些报纸还登载了美国专栏作家艾尔索普攻击伊拉克政府是所谓“共产党政权”的文章。
