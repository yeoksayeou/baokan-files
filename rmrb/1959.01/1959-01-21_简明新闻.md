Brief News

    Decentralized Livestock Raising
    According to this newspaper, since Minhou County, Fujian, implemented decentralized livestock and poultry raising in December of last year, the county's animal husbandry has rapidly developed. The so-called decentralized raising means that under the unified planning and arrangement of the commune, the commune is responsible for the portion of production for urban supply and state transfer; the portion needed by the commune's canteens is contracted to the large teams for production; and small livestock and poultry raised by commune members are disposed of by individuals.
    Chengmen People's Commune recently expanded a livestock farm, planning to develop 20,000 pigs by the end of the year; Langqi Commune and Tingjiang Commune jointly established a breeding duck farm. The enthusiasm of public canteens and individual commune members for raising livestock is also very high.

    "Hundred Mu, Hundred Items" Experiment
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Qutang People's Commune in Hai'an County, Jiangsu, is conducting one hundred scientific experiments for high yield on one hundred mu of three-wheat fields. The experimental work is mainly carried out by the commune's scientific research institute and agricultural middle school.
    This experimental work has greatly guided and promoted the management of other wheat fields in the commune. For example, in the past, there was no habit of winter irrigation in wheat fields, but after the commune members participated in these experimental fields, 110,000 mu of spring fields in the entire commune have been winter-irrigated. This experiment has also increased the interest of cadres and farmers in studying agricultural knowledge.

    Automatic Shifting Tractor
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Changshu County, Jiangsu, has successfully trial-produced an automatic shifting rope tractor powered by a power belt. This tractor is composed of an automatic shifter, rope, winch, and double-way plow. After the machine is started, it can smoothly and automatically plow back and forth without anyone holding the plow, plowing 1.2 mu of land per hour.
    In order to further study and promote this tractor, Changshu County has established a specialized research institution.

    Using Geothermal Energy to Grow Vegetables
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Xiong Yuezhen Non-staple Food Purchasing and Marketing Station of the Gaiping People's Commune in Liaoning is making great efforts to produce vegetables in greenhouses using the natural geothermal energy of local hot springs. The vegetables cultivated in these greenhouses not only meet the needs of the local people but also support nearby towns.
    These greenhouses are simple in structure. They only need to dig open the sand layer near the hot spring, add fertile soil, and build a shed roof.

    Commune's "Industrial Street"
    According to this newspaper, after the Zhanggezhuang area of Shunyi District in Beijing established the People's Commune, it established 294 small and medium-sized factories, including machinery, fertilizer, papermaking, and brick and tile industries. 15% of the commune members are engaged in these industrial productions. Because the factories are concentrated together, they form the commune's "industrial street."
    The characteristic of these factories is that they try to produce whatever is needed. For example, in order to repair agricultural tools, they established iron factories; late corn needs topdressing, so they sent people to other places to learn how to make chemical fertilizers, and soon set up 47 comprehensive fertilizer factories. In addition to being used by the commune itself, the surplus of some products can be sold. In order to adapt to agricultural production, some factories (such as brick and tile, embroidery, etc.) stop work during the busy farming season so as not to delay agricultural work.

    分权分养牲畜
    本报讯　福建闽侯县各人民公社，从去年12月实行分权分养牲畜家禽以来，全县畜牧业迅速发展。所谓分权分养，即在公社统一规划和安排下，公社负责生产城市供应和国家外调任务部分；公社食堂需用部分，由各大队包干生产；社员生产的小家畜家禽，归个人处理。
    城门人民公社最近扩建了一个畜牧场，计划在年底发展生猪两万头；琅岐公社和亭江公社合办了种鸭繁殖场。各公共食堂和社员个人饲养家畜的积极性也很高。
    “百亩百项”试验
    据新华社讯　江苏海安县曲塘人民公社，在一百亩三麦田中进行百项丰产科学试验。试验工作是以公社的科学研究所和农业中学为主进行的。
    这项试验工作，对公社其他麦田的管理有很大的指导和推动作用。如当地过去没有麦田冬灌习惯，但社员们参加这些试验田后，全社已有十一万亩春田进行了冬灌。这项试验也增加了干部和农民研究农业知识的兴趣。
    自动移行牵引机
    据新华社讯　江苏常熟县试制成功用动力带动的自动移行绳索牵引机。这种牵引机是由一台自动移行器、绳索、绞盘和双向犁等部件组成。机器发动后，不要人扶犁，即可平稳地自动来回耕作，每小时耕田一亩二分。
    为了进一步研究和推广这种牵引机，常熟县成立了专门研究机构。
    利用温泉热能种菜
    据新华社讯　辽宁盖平人民公社熊岳镇副食品购销分站，利用当地温泉的天然热能，大搞温室来生产蔬菜。这些温室栽培的蔬菜，不但满足了当地人民需要，还能支援附近的城镇。
    这些温室结构简单，只要在温泉附近挖开沙层，添进沃土，搭上棚顶就成了。
    公社的“工业街”
    本报讯　北京顺义区张各庄在成立人民公社后，建立了包括机械、化肥、造纸、砖瓦等业二百九十四个中小型工厂，全社15％的社员从事这些工业生产。由于工厂集中在一起，形成了公社的“工业街”。
    这些工厂的特点是，需要什么就设法生产什么。比如，为了修配农具，就成立铁工厂；晚玉米需要追肥，就派人到外地学制化肥，很快就办起了四十七个综合化肥厂。某些产品除供公社自用外，多余部分可以出售。为了适应农业生产，部分工厂（如砖瓦、刺绣等）在农忙时停工，以便不误农时。
