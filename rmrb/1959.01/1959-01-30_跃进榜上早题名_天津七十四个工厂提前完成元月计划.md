Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 29th. By the 28th, seventy-four factories in Tianjin had already completed their January Leap Forward plans ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of the new year, the workers and staff of these factories, in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and on the basis of the great leap forward of last year, have begun their struggle with greater vigor to realize this year's comprehensive leap forward plan.

The workers of the Deqing Machine Factory, which produces transmission chain belts, implemented more than sixty technical innovation proposals in just over ten days, improving production efficiency, thus increasing the plan for the first quarter of this year by 2.7 times compared with the same period last year. The workers and staff of Tianjin Chemical Raw Materials Pharmaceutical Factory put forward more than 1,050 technical innovation proposals in January, and more than 950 have now been implemented. The belt machine in the polyvinyl chloride plastic workshop of the Zhonghua Plastic Products Factory used to be operated manually, which was both laborious and of poor quality. In January, the workers used local materials and did it themselves, fighting for five days to convert it into automated production, which rapidly improved work efficiency, thereby over fulfilling the Leap Forward plan.

The workers of these factories have also tried every means to attack the "gates" of insufficient raw materials and the "gates" of equipment difficulties. Worker Wang Yuzhu of the Hongqi Chemical Factory, together with technicians, tried to use mirabilite and lime to replace alkali to manufacture a medicinal raw material that met quality standards, finding a new way to solve the problem of insufficient caustic soda. To solve the problem of timber shortage, the workers of the Comprehensive Wood Factory of the Handicraft Bureau also used their spare time to run all over the city's dyeing and chemical factories to recover more than 1,300 old adhesive board boxes, thereby ensuring that the entire factory over fulfilled the January plan seven days ahead of schedule.

    跃进榜上早题名
    天津七十四个工厂提前完成元月计划
    新华社天津29日电　到28日止，天津市有七十四个工厂已经提前完成1月份跃进计划。
    进入新年以来，这些工厂的职工根据党的八届六中全会精神，在去年大跃进的基础上，以更大的干劲为实现今年的全面跃进计划开始了奋战。
    生产传动链带的德庆机器厂职工，在十几天当中就实现六十多件技术革新建议，提高了生产效率，从而使今年一季度的计划比去年同期增长了二点七倍。天津市化学原料制药厂的职工1月份提出技术革新建议一千零五十多件，现在已实现九百五十多件。中华塑料制品厂聚氯乙烯塑料工段的腰带机过去是人工操作，既费力气质量又不好；1月份，工人们就地取材，自己动手，奋战五天，改成自动化生产，使工作效率迅速提高，从而超额完成了跃进计划。
    这些工厂的职工还千方百计地猛攻某些原材料不足的“关”和设备上的困难“关”。红旗化工厂工人王玉柱同技术人员一起，试用芒硝和石灰代替碱面制造出一种合乎质量标准的医药原料，为解决烧碱不足的问题找到了新途径。手工业局综合木制厂的职工为解决木料缺乏问题，还利用业余时间跑遍全市染化工厂收回一千三百多个旧粘板箱，从而保证全厂提前七天超额完成了1月份计划。
