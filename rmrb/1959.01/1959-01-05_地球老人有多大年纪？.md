    How Old is Old Man Earth?
    Shí Gōng

    As the New Year of 1959 has just arrived, the people of the whole country have once again mounted the fast horse of "leap forward again and again." In this era where "one day equals twenty years," time is especially precious to us. When considering how to improve work efficiency, people are no longer just calculating how to save a few hours, but are striving for every minute and every second.

    But do you know how much time has passed since the Earth was formed?

    People have been trying to solve the age of the Earth for a long time. The famous scientist Newton once calculated, based on the Bible, that the Earth was already six thousand and thirty years old in 1725 AD. Naturally, this is not credible at all.

    The silt on the continent is constantly being carried to the ocean and accumulated to become rock. As time goes by, it piles up thicker and thicker. Approximately every three thousand to ten thousand years, a one-meter-thick rock layer can be formed. Scientists thought of using the total thickness of this rock in the Earth's crust (about one hundred kilometers) to estimate the age of the Earth. The result of the estimation is that the Earth is about 300 million to 1 billion years old. But this number is obviously still inaccurate, because the Earth existed long before the sediment began to accumulate. Moreover, the rate at which sediments accumulate varies from era to era. Some people have thought of using the study of the concentration of salt in seawater to calculate the age of the Earth, also based on how much salt is brought into the sea each year. Naturally, this cannot avoid the above weaknesses. At the same time, no one can say for sure how much salt was originally in the seawater.

    However, in 1896, the radioactivity of uranium was discovered, and people gradually realized that when uranium atoms split, a new element, lead, can be generated. (This lead has the same chemical properties as ordinary lead, but a different atomic weight.) This change is not affected by changes in temperature, pressure, or electricity, magnetism, or chemicals. After about 4.52 billion years, half of the existing uranium will have turned into lead and other elements. According to this rule, the age of a uranium-containing mineral can be determined by measuring how much has turned into lead. According to actual measurements, the oldest minerals in the world are over 2 billion years old, and the age of the Earth is of course greater than 2 billion years. Some people assume that all the lead on Earth is the result of uranium splitting, and after extrapolation, the age of the Earth is estimated to be between 3.3 and 5 billion years.

    Last year, Soviet oceanographers estimated the age of the Earth to be 10 billion years based on studies of sediments on the ocean floor. It seems that exploration in this area is still developing, but in general we can see that human understanding of the Earth's history is gradually deepening. It is not unknowable, but knowable. The future is long, and humanity's grasp of the mysteries of nature has truly unlimited prospects!

    地球老人有多大年纪？
    石工
    1959年的新岁刚降临，全国人民又跨上了“跃进再跃进”的快马。在这“一天等于二十年”的时代，时间对我们是特别宝贵的，人们在考虑提高工作效率的时候，已经不只是计算如何节省几点钟而是几分几秒也要争取了。
    可是你知道地球生成以来，已经度过了多少时候了呢？
    很早以前就有人打算解决地球的年龄问题。著名的科学家牛顿曾经根据圣经算出了地球在公元1725年时已有六千零三十岁。自然这是毫不足信的。
    大陆上的泥沙不断被搬到海洋里聚集起来变成岩石，日子愈久堆得愈厚，大约每三千——一万年能造成一公尺厚的岩层。科学家想到了用地壳中这种岩石的总厚度（约一百公里）来推算地球的年龄。推算的结果，地球大约有三亿到十亿岁。可是这个数字显然还是不准确的，因为在泥沙开始堆积以前地球早就存在了。而且各个时代沉积物聚集的速度也不会相同。有人想到利用对海水中盐的浓度的研究来计算地球的年龄，也是根据每年有多少盐分带到海里来计算的。自然这也避免不了上面的弱点，同时原始的海水中究竟有多少盐，谁也说不清楚。
    可是1896年铀的放射性被发现了，人们逐渐认识到在铀的原子分裂时，能生成一种新的元素铅，
  （这种铅的化学性质与普通铅一样，但是原子量不同。）这个变化的进行不受温度、压力的变化以及电、磁、化学药品的影响。大约经过四十五亿二千万年，现有的铀便有一半变成了铅和其他的元素。根据这个规律，从某种含铀矿中有多少变成了铅，可以测知它的年龄。据实测的结果，世界上最古老的矿物有二十亿以上的年龄，地球的年岁当然比二十亿还要大。有人假设地球上的铅都是铀分裂的结果，加以推算，地球的年龄约在三十三至五十亿年间。
    去年，苏联海洋学家根据对大洋底部沉积物的研究，估计地球年龄已有一百亿年。看来这方面的探索还在发展，不过总的我们可以看出，人类对地球历史的认识是逐渐深入的，并不是不可知而是可知的。来日方长，人类掌握自然的奥秘前途真是无限！
