The Soviet People Opened the Northern Sea Route
By Our Correspondent Li Nan

    Sailing Scene
    Every year in July, the solid ice on the Soviet Arctic seas begins to break and melt, and the distant route from the Bering Strait in the east to the White Sea in the west awakens. Sailors, pilots, and scientists at scientific stations are all mobilized, welcoming the most active and tense season of the year with renewed energy.

    Convoys of ships depart from Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, heading for distant destinations. The scene of the convoy's movement is magnificent: icebreakers with steel armor all over their bodies lead the way, airplanes soar in the sky, the convoy captain directs from the air, and radio operators and scientific workers on the ships are busy collecting ice condition forecasts from various regions. The convoy promptly passes through the particularly difficult Chelyuskin Strait, followed by a huge ice floe flowing southward from the Arctic Ocean, blocking this narrow section. After the ice floes gradually move away, the second convoy closely follows.

    This is the prosperous scene on the Soviet Arctic seas today. When we visited the Arctic, the night was dark and the ice was frozen, but everywhere people talked about the grand occasion during the navigation season. Whether at the Dickson Radio Center, the drifting ice station of the Polar Center, or on Franz Josef Land, the northernmost territory of the Soviet Union, and Chelyuskin, the northernmost point of Eurasia, Arctic workers always say, "Everything is for the Northern Sea Route" when they talk about their work tasks. People often hear such bold words: "We must strive for a longer navigation season," "We must overcome the ice," "We must push the route further north." In the northern region of the Arctic Ocean, the ice layer is like an iron shell, but the Soviet people are prepared to open it up and open a blue sea route.

    Forty Years of Arduous Struggle

    From east to west, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, the northern coastline of the Soviet Union stretches for thousands of kilometers, making it the longest shipping route in the Soviet Union. The inability to open this route means that many of the largest rivers have no outlets, and the transportation in the vast eastern and northern regions, including Siberia, is hindered, making it difficult to fully develop the economy and construction in these areas. An Arctic pilot said to us very vividly when talking about the Northern Sea Route: "The northern coast is the front door of Russia. It is hard to imagine that the front door is always closed. The labor of our Arctic workers is to decorate the northern front door beautifully."

     "Russia needs access to the northern seas!" Many concerned people have issued such calls in the past, but the Tsarist government before the revolution had neither the strength to fight the solid ice of the Northern Sea nor the desire to develop the north. Tsarist officials regarded the demand to develop the Northern Sea Route as an unforgivable stupidity. In the fifty years before the revolution, only individual sections of the Northern Sea Route had been navigated, with a total of ninety-two ships passing through. The transportation volume of fifty years was less than that of several convoys in one voyage today.

    Only the Soviet people under the Soviet regime, through forty years of arduous struggle, opened up Arctic shipping. As early as 1918, Lenin signed an order to conduct hydrological research on the Arctic Ocean waterway. In 1920, under Lenin's instructions, more than 10,000 tons of Siberian grain were transported from the Ob River through the Kara Sea and the Barents Sea to Arkhangelsk to relieve the starving cities at that time. From 1920, reconnaissance teams were continuously organized to study the Arctic region, gradually extending the route to the mouth of the Yenisei River. In 1932, based on the research results over the years, the icebreaker "Sibiryakov" broke the superstition that the northern ocean could not be navigated, and completed the entire voyage from west to east past the north coast of Severnaya Zemlya in one voyage. The ship departed from Arkhangelsk, fought against ice floe attacks along the way, opened up roads under difficult conditions, and took sixty-five days to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Bering Strait. This was an unprecedented event in Arctic shipping, and the glory belongs to the Soviet people who dared to challenge the forces of nature in the Arctic. From the 1930s, large-scale construction of seaports and scientific stations was also carried out on the Northern Sea Route.

    Many years are unforgettable in the history of the Soviet people conquering the Arctic and pioneering the Northern Sea Route. In 1933, the steamship "Chelyuskin" sailed directly from the west to the Bering Strait. In 1935, icebreakers were used for the first time to navigate to higher latitudes further north. In 1937, the first drifting ice station was established, completing a long-distance flight across the Arctic region. In 1939, the icebreaker "Stalin" completed a round trip from Murmansk to the Pacific Ocean in one navigation season. These historical records of the years mark the Soviet people's advance into the Arctic step by step, achieving one new victory after another on the Northern Sea Route.

    Overcoming Ice Barriers and Snow Obstructions

    On the Northern Sea Route, the greatest difficulty is to fight against huge ice layers, countless icebergs, and endless ice floes. During our trip to the Arctic, we heard new terms such as "ice condition forecast," "forecast of ice floe movement," and "long-term control of ice conditions," and felt that only by controlling the natural laws of the entire vast Arctic region could we have today's waterway. Comrade Deliatsky, who had served as the station chief of the Sixth Drifting Ice Station, accompanied us and explained to us the practical significance of Arctic scientific work for shipping. He said: "To grasp the ice conditions, it is necessary to master the wind force, ocean currents, seabed topography, and weather. In the Arctic Ocean with tens of millions of square kilometers, how much heroic labor is required!"

    At present, there are more than 110 scientific stations in the Soviet Arctic region. There are often two drifting ice stations drifting in the heart of the Arctic region all year round. Some of these scientific stations have only three or four people, working hard on small islands that cannot be found on the map, and forecasting the weather to the mainland. It is they who have made human traces everywhere in the desolate Arctic Ocean; it is they who have made bright lights shine everywhere on the ice in the long Arctic night.

    As early as Igarka, we heard sailors praise the accurate grasp of ice floe movement. Local comrades said, "For example, in 1958, we knew long ago that the ice layer would move southward in large quantities on October 15. Sure enough, the ice layer moved southward on this day, and the docks and ships were fully prepared."

    The vast number of workers on the Arctic Ocean are measuring hour by hour, region by region, and accumulating vast amounts of data year after year. They issue more than 650 kinds of ice condition forecasts every year. This arduous and down-to-earth spirit of the Russian people has finally figured out the law of Arctic ice floes and broken through the difficulties of ice barriers and snow obstructions.

    Strong Fleet, Powerful Outpost

    However, to navigate on the Northern Sea, in addition to knowing the ice conditions, there must be a fleet to fight the solid ice, first of all, a strong icebreaker fleet. In the ports within the Arctic Circle, we saw the heroic posture of icebreakers. Ships like "Stalin," "Okhotsk," and "Lena" are all heavily armored and powerful icebreakers. We heard that some new icebreakers with more than 60,000 horsepower are being built.

    The news that the 44,000-horsepower "Lenin" atomic icebreaker was about to sail made people working in the Arctic region very excited. This ship will break solid ice more than two meters thick and can sail all year round without fuel. Scientists told us that the ice layer in the central Arctic region is generally more than two meters thick!

    "The most reliable assistant for Arctic navigators and scientists," this is the praise we often hear for the aviation team in the Arctic region. Since using airplanes to help the Northern Sea fleet navigate, it should be said that the Soviet people have completely tamed the Northern Sea Route. In Dickson, we met the pilot Kirinov, who had just returned from a mission. He flew for thirteen consecutive hours and reached thirteen scientific stations. He said to us: "In the summer, I fly over the fleet all day, giving the fleet instructions on the route. Sometimes the southern area is blocked by thick ice, but the pilot finds a thin ice area in the north and finds the route."

    On that barren island with one meter deep snow, on that ice floe that is hundreds of meters long, the Arctic eagles of the Soviet people freely take off and fly, becoming the outpost for the fleet to navigate on the Northern Sea and a powerful weapon to fight the ice layer.

    New Technologies Come One After Another

    Before the revolution, the Northern Sea Route had never been surveyed. On the thousands of kilometers of coastline, no area had lighting equipment, and there were only twenty-five navigation marks in total. Only the Soviet people were not afraid of difficulties and worked hard to improve the waterway. As early as 1940, there were already five radio navigation stations, thirteen electric lighthouses, one hundred and fifty-four illuminated navigation marks, more than two hundred ordinary marks, and four signal stations on the Northern Sea Route. Today, the Northern Sea Route is full of electric torches and signs, and the former graveyard of ships has become a safe waterway.

    In a large area from the White Sea and the Barents Sea to the East Siberian Sea and the Chukchi Sea, many excellent seaports with modern equipment have been built one after another since 1920. There are about ten of these ports, which are the bases of the fleet. The ports can fully supply the ships with fuel and food and can quickly load and unload goods. In 1957, the volume of goods transshipped in various ports on the Northern Sea increased three times compared with 1940.

    Many new technologies are being added to the northern route one after another. Radar equipment for observing wind speed and direction, remotely controlled weather stations, radio equipment for observing the ionosphere, and automatic drifting stations are located in more than one place in the Arctic Ocean. In addition to atomic icebreakers, jet propeller passenger planes will also be allocated for use on the Arctic route. In various ports, new-style cranes, conveyor belts, barges, and tugboats not only mechanize loading and unloading operations but also ensure that the fleet can set sail quickly and adapt to changes in ice conditions.

    A Route of Friendship

    Soviet Deputy Minister of Maritime Transport Afanasiev said in an interview with us: "The volume of freight on the Northern Sea has increased tenfold in the past twenty-five years, and has doubled during the Fifth Five-Year Plan compared with the Fourth Five-Year Plan." To increase the volume of shipping on the Northern Sea, it is natural to increase ships and equipment, but more importantly, to extend the duration of navigation.

    At present, the Northern Sea navigation season is only about four months a year. Can it be extended? When observing the ice thickness at the Seventh Drifting Ice Station, station chief Belov said when talking about shipping: "Can we imagine more than half a year, or even year-round navigation? Of course, this seems like a fantasy now, but wasn't it a fantasy to even conduct one voyage on the Northern Sea a few years ago?" He said, "To achieve this, first, we must have a brand-new fleet; second, we must completely conquer the various difficulties of the Arctic night; third... there is still a lot of work to be done in the Arctic region!"

    "Not only must we extend the duration of navigation, but we must also advance to higher latitudes," Comrade Belov added. In 1955 and 1956, there were two voyages to high latitudes, reaching areas above 83 degrees north latitude, and extensive and comprehensive scientific research work was carried out on the ships.

    During my visit to the Arctic region, I heard an interesting historical fact: Originally, many countries desperately wanted to survey the Arctic because it was closely related to finding the closest route to the East and China from the north. For this purpose, many people sacrificed their lives in the Arctic Ocean. The Dutch navigator Barents was one of these victims. Three years after his death, people found the hut where he lived on the island, and there was an open book on the table: "History of China."

    Passing through the northern ocean is indeed the closest ocean route to China and the East. The Soviet people have opened up this route. In Arkhangelsk, I met Comrade Dugin, the manager of the Northern Shipping Company. He said, "Last year and this year, ships have passed through the Northern Sea Route to China from here. Now the 'Volga' and 'Northern Dvina' are in Chinese ports. It only takes more than twenty days to go from here to China via the Northern Sea, but it takes one or two months if you go from the south. This is the closest route!" After a pause, he added, "We hope that more ships will go to China from the Northern Sea Route, and we also hope that Chinese ships will come from the Northern Sea in the future. The Soviet northerners are stern in appearance, but their hearts are fiery. We love friendship and love the Chinese people." The achievements of the Soviet people's forty years of struggle to open up the Northern Sea Route have opened up a route that helps strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    苏联人民开辟了北海航路
    本报记者　李楠
    航行景象
    每年7月，苏联北冰洋各海上的坚冰开始破裂融解，东到白令海峡，西到白海的辽远航路苏醒过来了。海员们、飞行员们、科学站的科学家们都动员了起来，以新的精力，迎接这一年中最活跃最紧张的季节。
    一列列的船队从摩尔曼斯克，从阿尔汗格尔斯克出发，驶向远程。船队行动的景象是蔚为壮观的：全身钢甲的破冰船在前面开路前进，飞机在天空翱翔，船队的队长在飞机上凌空指挥，船上的无线电员和科学工作者在紧张地收集各个地区发来的冰情预报。船队及时地通过了全程中特别困难的车留斯金海峡，接着从北冰洋上又往南流下了巨大的冰层，把这个狭窄的地段堵塞起来，等到浮冰逐渐移动开了之后，第二列船队又紧接着经过。
    这就是今天苏联北冰洋各海上的繁荣景象。当我们在北极访问的时候，夜色沉沉，寒冰冻结，但是到处人们都谈起这种在航行期中的盛况。无论是在迪克森的无线电中心，在极地中心的浮冰站，还是在苏联最北的领土佛兰兹约瑟夫群岛，和欧亚大陆的最北端车留斯金，北极工作者们一谈到工作任务时，总是这样说：“一切都是为了北海航路”。人们常常可以听到这样的豪语：“我们要争取更多的航行期”，“我们要战胜冰块”，“我们要把航路推向更北的地区”。在北冰洋北部地区，冰层像一层铁壳一样，但是苏联人民准备打开它，开辟蓝色的航路。
    苦战四十年
    从东到西，从太平洋到大西洋，苏联的北方海岸线绵延数千公里，是苏联最长的航线。这条航线打不开就等于许多最大的河流没有出口，包括西伯利亚在内的广大东部、北部地区的交通受到阻碍，这些地方的经济和建设很难充分发展。一个北极飞行员对我们讲到北方航路时，很形象地说：“北方海岸是俄罗斯的正门，很难设想，正门永远封闭了起来。我们北极工作人员的劳动就是把北方的正门打扮得很漂亮。”
      “俄罗斯需要北方各海上的海口！”过去许多有心人士发出过这样的呼声，但是革命前的沙皇政府既没有力量和北海的坚冰斗争，也没有开发北方的愿望。沙皇官吏把开发北海航路的要求，看作是不可饶恕的蠢事。革命前的五十年间，北海航路只有个别段落，一共行驶过船只九十二艘。五十年的运输量还不及现在一次航行中的几列船队。
    只有苏维埃政权下的苏联人民，在苦战四十年中，才开辟了北极地区的航运。还在1918年，列宁就签署了命令对北冰洋海道进行水文研究。1920年，在列宁的指示下，从鄂毕河经过喀拉海、巴伦支海将一万多吨西伯利亚的粮食运到阿尔汗格尔斯克，救济当时饥饿的城市。从1920年起不断组织勘察队研究北极地区，把航路逐渐伸展到叶尼塞河口。1932年，根据历年来研究的成果，破冰船“西比里亚科夫号”，打破了北方海洋不能通航的迷信，在一次航程中完成了经过北地岛北岸从西到东的全程航行。船只从阿尔汗格尔斯克出发，沿途战胜浮冰的袭击，在困难的条件下开辟道路，用六十五天的时间，经过白令海峡开到了太平洋。这是北冰洋航运上破天荒的一次，而光荣是属于勇于向北极自然力挑战的苏联人民。从三十年代起，在北方航路上，还展开了大规模的建设海港和科学站的工作。
    有许多年代是苏联人民征服北极，开创北方航路的历史上令人难以忘怀的。1933年“车留斯金号”轮船从西直航到了白令海峡。1935年第一次用破冰船向更北的高纬度地带航行。1937年建立了第一个浮冰站，完成了通过北极地区的长途飞行。1939年“斯大林号”破冰船在一次航期中完成了从摩尔曼斯克到太平洋的往返航行。这些年代的历史纪录，标志着苏联人民一度一度地向北极推进，在北方航道上取得一个接着一个的新胜利。
    克服了冰拦雪阻
    在北海航道上，最大的困难是要和巨大的冰层，无数的冰山，无穷尽的浮冰奋斗。在北极旅行的时候，我们听到了这类的新名词：“冰情预报”、“预报浮冰移动”、“长期掌握冰情”，感到只有控制了整个北极广大地区的自然规律，才有今天的航道。陪我们一道来的是曾经担任过第六浮冰站站长的德利阿茨基同志，他一路上给我们解释北极的科学工作对于航运的实际意义。他说：“要掌握冰情，就必须掌握风力、洋流、海底地形、气象，在上千万平方公里的北极海洋上，要多少英勇的劳动啊！”
    现在，苏联的北极地区一共有一百一十多个科学站。经常有两个浮冰站在北极心脏地区整年整月的漂流。这些科学站有的只有三、四个人，在地图上找不到的小岛上埋头工作，向大陆预报气象。正是他们使荒寒的北极海洋上，到处有人类的踪迹；正是他们使漫长的北极夜的寒冰上到处闪亮着明亮的灯火。
    还在伊加尔卡，我们就听到海员们赞扬冰情移动掌握得非常准确。当地的同志说，“比如1958年，我们早就知道10月15日冰层要大批南下。果然正是这天冰层南下了，码头和船只都作了充分准备”。
    在北极海洋上的广大工作者们一小时一小时的进行测量，一个地区一个地区的测量，长年累月，累集了浩繁的资料，他们每年发出六百五十多种冰情预报。俄罗斯人民的这种艰苦踏实的精神，终于摸出了北极浮冰的规律，打破了冰拦雪阻的难关。
  坚强的船队　有力的前哨
    但是，在北海上航行，除了必须知道冰情而外，还要有和坚冰斗争的船队，首先是强大的破冰船队。在北极圈内的港口，我们看到破冰船的雄姿。像“斯大林号”、“鄂华号”、“勒拿号”都是披坚带甲，马力强大的破冰船。我们听说，一些马力在六万以上的新破冰船正在建造。
    四万四千匹马力的“列宁号”原子破冰船将要航行的消息，使北极地区工作的人们非常兴奋。这艘船要破二公尺多厚的坚冰，能够不带燃料整年航行。科学工作者们告诉我们说，北极中央地区的冰层大体上都是二公尺多厚啊！
    “北极航海员和科学家们的最可靠的助手”，这是我们在北极地区经常听到的人们对航空队的赞语。自从用飞机来帮助北海船队航行之后，应该说苏联人民就完全驯服了北方航路。在迪克森，我们遇见了刚执行任务回来的飞行员基里诺夫，他连续飞行了十三小时，到达了十三个科学站。他对我们说：“夏天整天在船队上空飞行，给船队指示道路。有时靠南地带被厚冰封锁了，但飞行员在北边找到了薄冰区域，找到了航路。”
    在那积雪一公尺深的荒岛上，在那长几百公尺的浮冰上，苏联人民的北极雄鹰，自由地起落飞翔，成了北海上船队航行的前哨，和冰层作斗争的有力武器。
    新技术源源而来
    革命前，北海航道从未经过勘察。在数千公里的海岸上，没有一个地区有照明设备，一共只有二十五个航行标志。只有苏联人民才不怕困难，辛苦经营，改善航道。还在1940年，北海航道上已经有五个无线电导航台，十三座电气灯塔，一百五十四个照明的航行标志，二百多个普通标志，四个信号站。今天北海航道到处是电炬和标志，原来船舶的坟场变成了平安的航道。
    在从白海、巴伦支海到东西伯利亚海、楚克奇海的一大片地区，许多优良的有近代化设备的海港，从1920年起一个接着一个地建成了。这些港口一共有十来个，是船队的基地。港口能充分供应船只的燃料和粮食，并且能迅速地起卸货物。1957年在北海各个港口上转运的货物量比1940年增加了三倍。
    许多新式的技术正在陆续补充北方航线。观察风速和风向的雷达设备，远距离操纵的气象台，观察电离层的无线电设备，自动漂流站等，在北冰洋上已不止一个地方有。除了原子破冰船外，像喷气螺旋桨客机也将拨给北极航线使用。在各个港口上，新式的起重机、传送带、驳船、拖船不仅使装卸工作机械化，并且保证船队能迅速启航，适应冰情的变化。
    友谊的航路
    苏联海运部副部长阿芳拉西也夫同志在一次接见我们时说，“二十五年来北海上的货运量增加了十倍，第五个五年计划期间比第四个五年计划期间增加了一倍。”要增加北海上的航运量自然要增加船只和设备，但更重要的要延长航行的期限。
    现在北海航运期一年只有四个月的光景，能不能延长呢？在第七浮冰站上观察冰厚时，站长别洛夫同志谈到航运时说：“能不能设想半年以上，乃至全年航行呢？这在现在看来，当然是幻想，但若干年前，不是连在北海上进行一次航行都是幻想吗？”他说，“做到这，第一要有崭新的船队，第二，要完全征服北极夜的各种困难，第三……在北极地区，要做的工作还很多啊！”
    “不仅要延长航行的期限，还要向高纬度地带前进。”别洛夫同志又说。1955年到1956年，曾经有两次船只航行在高纬度地带，曾经到达过北纬八十三度以上的地区，在船只上进行了广泛综合的科学研究工作。
    在北极地区访问的时候，我听到了一件有趣的历史事实：原来过去许多国家拼命想勘察北极是和要从北方找到去东方和中国的最近的航路有密切关系。为了这个目的，许多人在北极海洋上牺牲了性命。荷兰航海家巴伦支就是这些牺牲者当中的一个。他死后三年，人们在岛上找到了他住的小屋，里面桌子上放着一本打开的书：“中国历史”。
    经过北方海洋的确是到中国和东方去的最近的海洋航路。苏联人民把这条航路打开了。在阿尔汗格尔斯克，我遇见北方轮船公司经理杜金同志，他说“去年和今年都有轮船从这里经过北海航路去中国。现在‘伏尔加号’和
  ‘北方德维拉号’正在中国港口。从这里经过北海到中国去只要二十多天，如果从南方走，要一两个月。这里是最近的航路啊！”停了一下，他又说，“我们希望有更多的船只从北海航路去中国，也希望将来中国的船只从北海开来。我们苏维埃北方人外表是严峻的，但内心是火热的，我们热爱友谊，热爱和喜欢中国人民。”苏联人民为打通北海航路奋斗四十年的成果开辟了一条有助增强中苏人民友谊的航路。
