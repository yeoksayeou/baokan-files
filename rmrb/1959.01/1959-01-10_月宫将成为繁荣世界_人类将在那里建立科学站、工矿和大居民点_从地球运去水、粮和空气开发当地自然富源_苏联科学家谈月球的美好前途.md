Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 9th.  The famous Soviet scientist Professor Sharonov said in an article published in "Soviet Culture Newspaper" that the future moon will be a prosperous world with scientific stations, factories, mines and large settlements. In the future, mankind will inevitably be able to live on other planets in the solar system, if not all planets, at least many.

Sharonov said that after the first expedition arrives on the moon, several expeditions will continue to the moon, where permanent scientific stations and observatories will be built. The staff will live in sealed residences, and the water, food and even air they need will be supplied by the earth. It is conceivable that in the more distant future, factories and mines will rise there, using the natural resources of this celestial body, which does not yet belong to us, to benefit mankind. Although the factories there are based on highly automated and remotely controlled equipment, they will always require the establishment of several large settlements on the moon. Of course, intermediate refueling stations will also be built on the moon for rockets that continue to fly into the depths of the universe, such as to Mars and Venus.

Some people may think this is just a fantasy. But Sharonov went on to say, we might as well look back at the past. In the Middle Ages, even if someone only talked about modern cities, about industrial centers with millions of people, wouldn't it have been considered pure fantasy, because the economy, technology and transportation in feudal society could not supply food and work materials for so many people? For example, Antarctica was a very desolate place not long ago, but now several towns have been built. Sharonov emphasized that the technology of communist society will completely overcome all the difficulties that mankind may encounter when living on the moon.

When talking about realizing space travel, Sharonov said that not long ago, flying to the moon was just a wish and a topic for science fiction novels, but now we have seen it become a reality. The first Soviet space rocket paved the way for future spaceflights. After it, there will be some more sophisticated spacecraft taking off, and the century in which mankind actually masters and begins to live on other planets is about to come. Those who are sitting at desks reading or standing in the ranks of the Young Pioneers will be the witnesses and participants of the first lunar trip.

    苏联科学家谈月球的美好前途
    新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联著名科学家夏罗诺夫教授在“苏维埃文化报”发表文章说，未来的月球将是一个拥有科学站、工厂、矿山和大居民点的繁荣的世界。将来，人类必然可以居住到太阳系的其他行星上，如果不是所有行星都能住到，至少可以住到许多行星上去。
    夏罗诺夫说，在第一支考察队到达月球之后，将会有若干考察队继续开往月球，在那里将会建起永久的科学站、天文台，工作人员居住在密闭的住所里，他们所需的水、粮食甚至空气都由地球供给。可以设想，在更远一些的将来，在那里将兴起工厂、矿山，利用暂时还不属于我们的这个天体上的自然富源来为人类造福。那里的工厂虽然是以高度自动化和遥控装备作基础的，但总会相应地要求在月球上建立起若干大的居民点。当然也会在月球上为那些继续飞向宇宙深处，如到火星、金星上去的火箭建设起中间加油站。
    可能有人认为这只不过是一种幻想。但夏罗诺夫接着说，关于这一点我们不妨回顾一下过去。在中世纪的时候，即使有人仅仅谈到现代的城市，谈到有几百万人口的工业中心，何尝不也曾被认为是纯粹的空想，因为封建社会里的经济、技术和运输都不可能供给这么许多人的食物和工作材料。再如，南极洲在不久前还是一个极荒凉的地方，而现在已经建起了若干村镇。夏罗诺夫强调说，共产主义社会的技术一定会完全克服人类在月球居留时可能遇到的一切困难。
    夏罗诺夫在谈到实现宇宙旅行的时候说，在不久前，飞往月球只是一个愿望和科学幻想小说的题材而已，但现在我们亲眼看到它已经变成了现实。苏联第一个宇宙火箭是为以后的宇宙航行铺平了道路的尖兵，在它之后将要有一些更完善的宇宙飞船起飞，人类实际掌握并开始居住到其他行星上去的世纪就要来到。现在那些坐在课桌旁读书的或是站在少先队的行列里的人，将是第一次月球旅行的见证人和参加者。
