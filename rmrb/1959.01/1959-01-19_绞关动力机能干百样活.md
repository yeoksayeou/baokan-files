Without fuel, without steel; low cost, wide use
Capstan Power Machine Can Do All Kinds of Work
Wuchang County Uses it to Drive Tools for Plowing, Tilling, Harrowing, Threshing, Threshing, Transporting Soil, Ramming, Blowing, Milling Rice, Pumping Water, and Generating Electricity

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 18th) The capstan power machine invented and created by the Anjia People's Commune in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, has attracted great attention from the leading departments here, which believe that this is the most suitable new power for the current countryside. This wooden power machine does not require fuel. As long as one to four horses are harnessed according to the workload, it can be used as the prime mover for all machines that currently require power in rural areas. The capstan power machine can drive farm tools for deep plowing, harrowing, sowing, and tilling; it can drive stone rollers for threshing grounds, and drive rice threshers for threshing and corn shelling machines for threshing, winnowing, and haymaking; used on water conservancy construction sites, it can transport soil, ram, and split soil; used in rural industries, it can drive belt lathes, generators, blowers, fire saws, rice milling machines, cotton ginning machines, water pumps, and grinding wheels.

The structure of the capstan power machine is very simple. It is composed of a winch similar to a rope traction machine and several transmission wheels that play a role in speed change. Unlike the rope traction machine, this winch is not cylindrical, but disc-shaped. The winch diameter can reach 1.8 to 2.6 meters, and the thickness is only 30 centimeters. The winch is buried underground, with a central vertical shaft, on which a horizontal horse-drawn bar is erected; the horse is harnessed to the bar, and walks like pushing a millstone. A transmission belt made of transmission belt or hemp rope connects the winch to a transmission wheel. Because the transmission wheel is much smaller than the winch, the transmission wheel rotates several times for each rotation of the winch. On the axle of the transmission wheel, there is also a larger transmission wheel, which rotates at the same speed as the transmission wheel. The second transmission belt connects this transmission wheel to the next smaller transmission wheel to form the second stage of speed change, and the second stage transmission wheel rotates faster than the first stage transmission wheel. On the axle of the second stage transmission wheel, there is also a larger transmission wheel, which is connected to the machine with a thinner transmission belt, so that the machine can rotate at a very high speed. The capstan power uses the principle of leverage and speed change. Currently, a capstan machine here can drive machines at 300 to 1,800 revolutions per minute.

Due to its simple structure and almost all raw materials being wood, the manufacturing cost of each capstan power machine is only 40 to 50 yuan. However, the capstan power machine has a wide range of uses and high efficiency. Using two horses to pull the capstan power machine can drive a 3-kilowatt generator, which can supply electricity for lighting for more than 100 households. Driving a rice thresher, 11 and a half laborers can thresh 28,000 catties of grain in 16 hours (two shifts), and the quality of the threshed grain is also high; while six strong laborers can only thresh 5,600 catties in the same time using a foot-operated rice thresher. The rice milling machine in the Hongxing Management District of the Anjia People's Commune can mill rice with three horses pulling the capstan power machine. Using two horses to pull a capstan power machine to drive a 30 cm diameter water pump can pump 50 tons of water per hour.

The birth of the capstan power machine in the Anjia People's Commune confirms that the best way to solve the problem of labor shortage in the Great Leap Forward is to reform tools and improve labor organization. The Anjia People's Commune has more than 113,000 mu of cultivated land, and only 4,855 male and female laborers, averaging more than 23 mu of cultivated land per laborer. In 1958, there was a bumper harvest, with many bundles of grain and many ears of crops, threshing was very labor-intensive, and at the same time, it was necessary to deep plow the land, build water conservancy, and draw people to engage in steelmaking. Calculated according to the highest labor efficiency standard at that time, there was still a shortage of 100,000 workdays. The labor force was very tight, and the production situation was passive. Among the 25 communes in the county, the production progress of the Anjia People's Commune was always ranked after 20th place. Therefore, the commune party committee decided that the first secretary Mu Runtang and the deputy township head Yang Zhanlin would be responsible for tool reform. They actively researched together with the members of the Hongxing Management District and Zhao Yinan and others, and created the capstan power machine based on the rope traction machine, which quickly changed the passive production situation. In 1957, 700 male and female laborers in the Hongxing Management District spent 90 days to complete the threshing. In 1958, due to other production occupying a lot of labor, only 350 relatively weak members remained for threshing, but with 50 capstan power machines installed, the threshing was completed in 25 days, and the task of delivering grain for purchase was completed.

Based on the results of three months of promotion and use, the masses summarized that the capstan power machine has the following major advantages. First, it can take the method of getting started with indigenous methods first and gradually realize rural mechanization and electrification. Second, the labor intensity of some production in rural areas has begun to be reduced. Many jobs that were difficult for strong men in the past can now be easily handled by the elderly, weak women. In the past, men used foot-operated rice threshers to thresh grain, with hands and feet in a mess; while women next to the rice thresher driven by the capstan power machine held bundles of rice and walked past the rice thresher in turn, and the rice was threshed cleanly after a few turns on the rice thresher. Third, the capstan power machine saves labor, produces more, and has high efficiency, which alleviates the labor shortage in the Great Leap Forward. Fourth, it saves fuel and reduces production costs. In the past, the gas power machine of the rice milling machine required one ton of coal and six catties of lubricating oil in three days and nights, and the expenses would be more than 30 yuan, not including machine depreciation costs. Now it saves a lot more. Fifth, the operation of the capstan power machine is extremely simple. Sixth, the capstan power machine is not greatly affected by natural conditions and can be used indoors, outdoors, and in the rain.

Now, the capstan power machine manufactured and used here is also planned to be improved to improve efficiency. The Anjia Commune is preparing to develop the current livestock-drawn capstan power machine into water and wind power driven. According to the opinion of the technicians of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, as long as the existing axle tiles of the capstan power machine are changed to ball bearings, a groove for hanging the transmission belt is made on the transmission wheel, and the wooden piles controlling the transmission belt are removed, the transmission resistance can be greatly reduced and the speed can be increased.

    不用燃料、不用钢材；成本低、用途广
    绞关动力机能干百样活
    五常县利用它带动工具耕地、铲趟，扬场、脱粒，运土、打夯，鼓风、碾米、抽水、发电
    本报哈尔滨18日电　黑龙江省五常县安家人民公社发明创造的绞关动力机，引起这里领导部门极大的注意，认为这是目前农村最适用的新的动力。这种木制的动力机不用燃料，只要根据工作量的需要，套上一匹到四匹马拉动，就可以做目前农村中一切要使用动力的机器的原动力。绞关动力机带上农具可以深耕、耙地、播种、铲趟；可以带石滚子打场，带打稻机脱谷和玉米脱粒机脱粒、扬场、打草；用在水利工地上可以运土、打夯、劈土；用在农村工业上，可以带动皮带机床、发电机、鼓风机、火锯、制米机、弹花机、水泵、砂轮。
    绞关动力机的构造非常简单。它是利用类似绳索牵引机的绞盘和几个起变速作用的传动轮组成的。和绳索牵引机不同的是，这种绞盘不是圆柱式的，而是磨盘式的。绞盘直径可以达到一点八公尺到二点六公尺，厚度只有三十公分。绞盘埋在地下，有一根中心立轴，立轴上横架着马拉杆；马套在杆子上，走起来就像推磨一样。用一根传动皮带或麻绳编的传动带，把绞盘和一个变速轮联结起来。变速轮因为比绞盘小得多，绞盘转一圈，变速轮就要转好几圈。在变速轮的轴杠上，还有一个较大的传动轮，和变速轮以同样速度旋转。第二根传动皮带把这个传动轮和下一个更小的变速轮联结起来构成第二级变速装置，第二级变速轮比第一级传动变速轮就转得更快。在第二级变速轮的轴杠上也有较大传动轮，它又和轮轴更细的机器用传动皮带联结着，就使机器能够以很高的速度旋转。绞关动力利用杠杆作用和变速作用的原理。目前，这里的一部绞关机可以带动每分钟三百转到一千八百转的机器。
    由于构造简单，原料差不多全部是木材，每部绞关动力机制造的成本只有四、五十元。但是绞关动力机的使用范围很广，而且效率很高。用两匹马拉绞关动力机，可以带动三千瓦的发电机，能供应一百多户人家照明用电。带动打稻机，十一个半劳动力在十六小时（两个班次）可脱谷二万八千斤，脱谷的质量也高；而六个强壮劳动力用脚踏打稻机，同样时间只能脱谷五千六百斤。安家人民公社红星管理区的制米机，装上绞关动力机，用三匹马拉就可以制米。用两匹马拉绞关动力机带动口径三十公分的水泵，每小时抽水五十吨。
    安家人民公社绞关动力机的诞生，证实了解决大跃进中劳动力紧张问题最好的办法是，改革工具和改善劳动组织。安家人民公社共有耕地十一万三千多亩，而男女劳动力只有四千八百五十五个，平均每个劳动力耕地二十三亩多。1958年大丰收，禾捆多，庄稼穗多，打场很费工，同时又要深翻地、修水利，抽人搞钢铁。按当时劳动力最高劳动效率标准计算，还缺十万个工。劳动力很紧张，生产局面被动，全县二十五个公社中，安家人民公社生产进度总排到二十名之后。于是公社党委决定由第一书记穆润棠和副乡长杨占林负责搞工具改革。他们在红星管理区和社员赵一男等人一起积极研究，根据绳索牵引机创造了绞关动力机，很快就改变生产被动局面。红星管理区1957年七百名男女劳动力共用九十天的时间才把场打完。1958年由于其他生产占用了很多劳动力，打场只剩下三百五十名体力比较弱的社员，但是装上了五十部绞关动力机，二十五天就把场打完了，并且完成了送交征购粮的任务。
    根据三个月的推广和使用结果，群众总结绞关动力机有以下几大好处。一、是从此可以采取土法先上马的办法，逐步实现农村机械化、电气化。二、农村一些生产的劳动强度开始减轻。许多过去强壮男子干起来还吃力的活，现在老弱妇女都可以大显身手。过去男子用脚踏打稻机脱谷，手忙脚乱；而在绞关动力机带动的打稻机旁妇女们拿着成束的稻谷依次从打稻机旁走过，稻谷在打稻机上翻几个身，稻子就打得干干净净。三、绞关动力机省工、出活、效率高，使大跃进中劳动力紧张的情况得到缓和。四、节省燃料，降低生产成本，制米机的煤气动力机过去三昼夜要用一吨煤，六斤滑润油，不算机器折旧费，就要开支三十多元。现在就省得多了。五、绞关动力机的操作极其简单。六、绞关动力机受自然条件的影响不大，室内、露天、雨中都可以使用。
    现在这里制造使用的绞关动力机还计划加以改进，提高效率。安家公社准备把现在畜力牵引的绞关动力机发展为水力和风力驱动。据黑龙江省农业厅技术人员的意见，只要把绞关动力机现有的轴瓦改为滚珠轴承，把变速轮做上挂传动带的槽，去掉控制传动带的木桩，就可以大大改轻传动阻力，增加转速。
