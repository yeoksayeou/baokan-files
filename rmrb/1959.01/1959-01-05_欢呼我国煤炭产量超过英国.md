Cheer Our Country's Coal Production Surpassing Britain

Driven and promoted by the doubling of steel production, coal production in 1958 reached 270.2 million tons, an increase of 1.07 times compared to 1957, exceeding Britain's 1958 production by more than 50 million tons, leaving Britain far behind. The speed of coal mine construction and geological exploration is also unprecedented. The new mine production capacity started in 1958 is more than twice the total started during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. Coal industry workers have worked hard for a year and have reaped abundant fruits. This is the first victory our people have achieved in the struggle to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products. There is every reason to believe that, following coal, the time for our country to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products will be much shorter than originally conceived.

Britain is one of the first countries to develop modern industry. The development history of China's modern industry (including the coal industry) was a hundred years behind Britain. China's coal production only reached more than 39 million tons in 1936, while Britain's coal production reached more than 37 million tons as early as the 1840s, when it launched the Opium War to invade China. In 1936, China's coal production was only 17% of Britain's production in the same year (232.1 million tons). During the First Five-Year Plan, China's coal production grew at an average annual rate of 19%. By the end of 1957, production reached 130.5 million tons, accounting for 58.5% of Britain's production in the same year (223 million tons). In just eight years, we have shortened the distance with Britain so much, and the vigorous vitality of the socialist system has been greatly revealed. However, in November 1957, after the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years, the British bourgeois gentlemen still said in a doubtful and sarcastic tone: that was a "distant goal," "can a horse grow wings?" History is really merciless, and in just one year, the Western bourgeoisie's satire of the People's China turned into ridicule of themselves. What seemed like such a distant goal to them, we achieved in one year. In their place, "horses" not only cannot grow wings, but even their four legs are becoming more and more unsound, but here, "horses" have indeed grown wings. Not only has the coal industry "horse" grown wings, but the steel industry, machinery industry, power industry, grain, cotton, and other "horses" have also grown wings. In 1958, when the industry and agriculture of capitalist countries such as the United States and Britain were struggling in the cold and bitter rain of economic crisis, our industry and agriculture were flying high and advancing rapidly. In terms of coal production growth, the figures that Britain took thirty-seven years and the United States took fourteen years to achieve, we only used one year. In terms of steel production growth, the figures that Britain took thirty-two years and the United States took seven years to achieve, we also only used one year. Now, just as the British and American bourgeoisie are worried about the economic prospects for 1959, our Party Central Committee has announced that this year will be a better and faster leap forward than last year! The socialist "steed" is always galloping on the broad road, while the capitalist old "horse" is already on its last breath.

The victory of coal production surpassing Britain is a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, a victory for the Party's mass line, a victory for the Party's policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, a victory for the Party's complete set of policies of walking on two legs, and also a victory for seriously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the help of the Soviet Union. This victory is great. But we must not be complacent when we cheer for this victory. The level that our country's coal production has reached still cannot meet the needs of our country's rapidly developing economy. This year is a decisive year for our country's three years of hard work. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party determined that this year's coal production should reach 380 million tons, an increase of about 110 million tons compared to last year. We must continue to go all out on the basis of the great victory of surpassing Britain and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan in terms of quantity, quality, and time.

Modern large-scale mines are the backbone of China's coal industry. They undertake more than three-quarters of this year's coal production and are the main suppliers of coal for key national steel enterprises, large cities, and domestic use. The success or failure of these enterprises not only affects the completion of the national coal production plan, but also affects the production and construction of the entire industry. These enterprises all made great leaps forward last year, but their production potential is still very large. Mines and working faces with basically the same natural and equipment conditions have different yields, reach designed capacity at different times, and have different labor productivity. Some mines and working faces have poor conditions, but their output is higher than those with good conditions, and some are even much higher. This shows that it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's mass line in large-scale coal mining enterprises, make a big revolution in technology, and pay special attention to transforming the production level of a few advanced mines and working faces into the production level of all mines and working faces, so as to achieve large-scale high yields. The practice of the past year has proved that hydraulic mining has a significant effect on increasing production, saving pit wood, saving labor, and improving working conditions, and is the main direction of technological revolution in the coal industry. Therefore, in 1959, this advanced technology must be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner to push China's coal industry production to a new peak.

In 1958, China's coal industry's "small indigenous groups" movement has shown great power. The number of small coal kilns has developed from more than 20,000 to more than 100,000. This powerful "small indigenous groups" movement not only met the needs of local blast furnaces and commune industries for coal, but also found many coalfields with excellent coal quality and abundant reserves in the previously so-called coal-free and coal-scarce areas of Jiangnan, providing very favorable conditions for the widespread development and rational layout of the coal industry. Therefore, further technical transformation of small coal kilns has become an important key to the development of the "small indigenous groups" movement. The technical transformation of small coal kilns must earnestly implement the policy of "focusing on transformation and comprehensively improving." That is, in areas with abundant coal and iron resources and convenient transportation, select a group of small coal kilns with development prospects for key transformation, so that the technical transformation of small coal kilns is combined with the establishment of new coal bases, combined with steel bases, and combined with comprehensive utilization, and gradually establish small and medium-sized coal and iron integrated industrial bases. In terms of technology, we must adopt the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, from indigenous to foreign, and rely on our own efforts. Small coal kilns are an important part of the people's commune industry. The development of small coal kilns can not only increase the income of the commune, but also prepare conditions for the further development of commune industry. The people's commune must conduct comprehensive planning and unified arrangements for the development of small coal kilns. Only in this way can the production of tens of thousands of small coal kilns gradually stabilize and improve.

Accelerating the construction of new coal industrial bases is an important measure to fully meet the needs of the rapid development of China's national economy for coal, and to rationalize the layout of China's coal industry. At present, the distribution of China's coal industry is very uneven. Modern large-scale mines are mainly concentrated in Northeast and North China, and coal production in areas north of the Yangtze River accounts for more than 70% of the national total. The foundation of the coal industry in other regions is relatively weak, especially in East China and South China, which have to transfer a large amount of coal from the north every year. The large amount of coal transported from the north to the south has caused tension in transportation and supply, and has also hindered the rapid development of industry in coal-deficient areas. Therefore, the focus of coal industry capital construction in 1959 should be placed in the south. Several new coal bases, especially coking coal bases, should be established in the south. In order to ensure the early completion of new coal bases, areas with a relatively good foundation in the coal industry must provide support from all aspects in the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard." In the Jiangnan area, it is also necessary to strengthen coalfield geological exploration and try every means to solve the transportation, power supply, and equipment supply problems of the new bases in order to accelerate the construction of new bases.

The quality of coal directly affects the quality of steel. Coal industry workers must complete the task of improving the quality of coal for steel as a political task. In order to ensure the quality of coal for steel, all mining areas that produce coking coal must accelerate the construction of coal washing plants, especially coal washing plants in large mining areas. In the construction, we must also combine large, medium, and small, combine indigenous and foreign, and walk on two legs, and build more simple coal washing plants. In this way, we can guarantee the supply of refined washed coal with relatively little investment in a relatively short period of time.

This year's plan is to produce 380 million tons of coal, which is a large increase compared to last year, but in terms of the speed of national economic development, it is still not very abundant. Therefore, while the coal industry is vigorously increasing production, the departments that use coal must still actively take measures to save coal.

The new battle for producing 380 million tons of coal in 1959 has already begun. The workers on the coal industry front must continue to carry forward the soaring enthusiasm in last year's battle to surpass Britain, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan.

### 欢呼我国煤炭产量超过英国

    欢呼我国煤炭产量超过英国
    在钢产量翻一番的带动和促进下，1958年煤炭产量达到了二亿七千零二十万吨，比1957年增长了一点零七倍，比英国1958年的产量多五千多万吨，把英国远远地抛在后面。煤矿基本建设和地质勘探的速度也是空前的。1958年开工建设的新井生产能力约为第一个五年计划期内开工的总和的两倍多。煤炭工业战线上职工同志们苦战一年，已经收到了丰硕的果实了。这是我国人民为争取在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的斗争中取得的第一个胜利。完全有理由可以相信，继煤炭之后，我国在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的时间，将比原来设想的要短得多。
    英国是现代工业发展最早的国家之一。我国现代工业
  （包括煤炭工业在内）发展的历史，曾落后于英国一百年。我国煤炭产量在1936年才达到三千九百多万吨，而英国远在1840年发动对我国侵略的鸦片战争年代，煤炭产量就达到了三千七百多万吨。1936年我国煤炭产量只有英国同年产量（二亿三千二百一十万吨）的17％。第一个五年计划期间，我国煤炭每年平均以19％的速度发展着，到1957年年底，产量达到了一亿三千零五十万吨，为英国同年产量（二亿二千三百万吨）的58.5％。短短的八年间，我们就把与英国的距离缩得那末短，社会主义制度旺盛的生命力已经大大显露出来。但是，1957年11月，当党中央提出争取十五年内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国的伟大号召以后，英国的资产阶级老爷们还以怀疑的和讽刺的口吻说道：那是“遥远的目标”，“难道马还能长翅膀？”历史实在无情，只一年时间，西方资产阶级对人民中国的讽刺变成了对自己的嘲笑。在他们看来是那么遥远的目标，我们却在一年中达到了。在他们那里，“马”不仅长不了翅膀，而且连四条腿也愈来愈不健全，但在我们这里，“马”的确长了翅膀。不仅煤炭工业这一匹“马”长了翅膀，钢铁工业、机械工业、电力工业、粮食、棉花等等的“马”也都长了翅膀。1958年，当美国英国等资本主义国家的工业农业在经济危机的凄风苦雨中一蹶不振的时候，我们的工业农业却在展翅高飞，一日千里。在煤炭产量增长方面，英国过去用了三十七年、美国用了十四年才能达到的数字，我们只用了一年时间。在钢产量增长方面，英国过去用了三十二年、美国用了七年才能达到的数字，我们也只用了一年时间。现在，正当英美资产阶级为1959年经济前景惶惶不安的时候，我们的党中央却宣布，今年要比去年跃进得更好更快！社会主义的骏“马”永远在康庄大道上奔驰，而资本主义的老“马”则已奄奄一息。
  煤炭产量超过英国的胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利，是党的以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针的胜利，是党的一整套两条腿走路的方针的胜利，也是在苏联的帮助下，认真学习苏联先进经验的胜利。这个胜利是伟大的。但我们在欢呼这个胜利的时候，一点也不能自满。我国煤炭产量已达到的水平，仍然不能满足我国一日千里的经济发展需要。今年是我国苦战三年具有决定意义的一年。党的八届六中全会确定今年煤炭产量要达到三亿八千万吨，即比去年增加一亿一千万吨左右。我们必须在超过英国的伟大胜利的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，保证按量、按质、按时地完成和超额完成国家计划。
    现代化的大型矿井，是我国煤炭工业的骨干力量。它担负着今年煤炭产量的四分之三以上，是全国重点钢铁企业、大城市工业和生活用煤的主要供应者。这些企业生产的好坏，不仅影响着全国煤炭产量计划的完成，而且影响着整个工业的生产和建设。这些企业在去年都有很大的跃进，但生产潜力仍然很大。自然条件和设备条件基本相同的矿井和工作面，产量有多有少，达到设计能力有早有迟，劳动生产效率有高有低。有些矿和工作面条件虽然不好，但产量却比条件好的还高，有的甚至高得很多。这就说明，必须在大型煤矿企业中继续贯彻群众路线的方针，大闹技术革命，特别要注意把少数先进矿井和工作面的生产水平变成所有矿井和工作面的生产水平，达到大面积丰产。过去一年的实践证明，水力采煤对提高产量、节约坑木、节约劳动力、改善劳动条件都有着重大的作用，是煤炭工业技术革命的主要方向。因此，1959年必须有计划有步骤地推广这一先进技术，把我国煤炭工业生产推向新的高峰。
    1958年我国煤炭工业“小土群”运动已经显示了巨大的威力。小煤窑已经由原来的二万多个发展到十多万个。这个声势浩大的“小土群”运动，不仅就地满足了土高炉和公社工业对煤炭的需要，而且在过去所谓无煤少煤的江南地区，找到了很多煤质优良、储量丰富的煤田，给煤炭工业遍地开花和合理布局，提供了十分有利的条件。因此，进一步从技术上改造小煤窑就成为“小土群”运动发展的重要关键。对小煤窑的技术改造，要认真贯彻执行“重点改造，全面提高”的方针。这就是在煤铁资源丰富、交通方便的地区，选择一批有发展前途的小煤窑进行重点改造，使小煤窑的技术改造与建立新的煤炭基地相结合，与钢铁基地相结合，与综合利用相结合，逐步建立中小型的煤铁综合工业基地。在技术方面，要采取土洋结合、由土到洋的办法，要自力更生。小煤窑是人民公社工业的重要组成部分。小煤窑发展了，既能增加公社的收入，又能为进一步发展公社工业准备条件。人民公社必须对小煤窑的发展进行全面规划，统一安排。这样才能使数以万计的小煤窑生产逐步稳定和提高。
    加速新的煤炭工业基地建设，是充分满足我国国民经济迅速发展对煤炭的需要，以及使我国煤炭工业布局趋于合理的重要措施。目前我国煤炭工业的分布很不均衡，现代化的大型矿井主要集中在东北、华北地区，长江以北地区的煤炭产量占全国总产量的70％以上；而其它地区煤炭工业的基础都比较薄弱，特别是华东、华南地区，每年都要从北方调进大量的煤炭。大量的北煤南运，既造成了运输和供应的紧张，也妨碍了缺煤地区工业的迅速发展。因此，1959年煤炭工业基本建设的重点应该放在南方。要在南方建立若干新的煤炭基地，特别是炼焦煤基地。为了保证新的煤炭基地早日建成，煤炭工业基础比较好的地区，必须本着“全国一盘棋”的原则，从各方面给以支援。在江南地区，还要加强煤田地质勘探工作，还要千方百计地解决新基地的交通运输、电源和设备供应问题，以便加快新基地的建设速度。
    煤炭的质量直接影响着钢铁的质量。煤炭工业职工必须把提高钢铁用煤的质量作为一项政治任务来完成。为了保证钢铁用煤的质量，凡是生产炼焦煤的矿区，必须加速洗煤厂、特别是大矿区洗煤厂的建设。在建设中，也要大中小并举，土洋并举，两条腿走路，要多建一些简易洗煤厂。这样，才能用比较少的投资，在比较短的时间内保证精洗煤的供应。
    今年计划生产三亿八千万吨煤，比去年有很大的增长，但从国民经济发展的速度来看，仍然不是很充裕的。所以，在煤炭工业大力增产的同时，使用煤炭的部门，仍要积极采取措施，节约用煤。
    1959年的为生产三亿八千万吨煤的新的战斗已经开始了。煤炭工业战线上的职工们，要继续发扬去年超过英国的战斗中的冲天干劲，苦干、实干、巧干，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
