Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th. Academician Topchiev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said at a press conference on the 6th that the launching of the first cosmic rocket and the creation of the first artificial planet is the pinnacle of science and technology, and from then on, it has opened up broad prospects for conquering interplanetary space. Therefore, the positive reaction of the world public to this outstanding event is very natural. It is one of the most heroic feats that mankind has ever conceived and achieved.

This press conference was held by the Soviet State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to celebrate the successful launch of the first cosmic rocket.

Academician Topchiev said that the first cosmic rocket passed the closest distance to the moon, which is approximately equal to twice the diameter of the moon, at 5:59 on January 4th. Now the Soviet rocket has left the earth for 800,000 kilometers and is 500,000 kilometers away from the moon. In this way, the Soviet cosmic rocket has actually entered the elliptical orbit of the first artificial planet.

Academician Topchiev said that launching a cosmic rocket and creating the first artificial planet is a huge achievement of human wisdom in overcoming the Earth's gravity for the first time.

Academician Topchiev said that when the first artificial Earth satellite was launched on October 4, 1957, some foreign commentators tried to insist that this was an accidental success, or described it as a record created by the Soviet Union against the backdrop of overall technological backwardness. Now, these claims have all gone bankrupt.

Academician Topchiev said that the tenth planet—the Soviet Union’s first artificial solar satellite—concentrates the latest achievements in radio electronics, remote control mechanics, metallurgy, chemistry, automatic devices, thermal engineering, and many other departments. We have successfully created powerful jet engines that can reach cosmic speeds in minutes. The most precise automatic equipment was manufactured to ensure accurate measurements and transmit various intelligence to hundreds of thousands of kilometers away. Academician Topchiev emphasized that only the most technologically advanced countries have the ability to do all this.

Then, Academician Blagonravov said that the Soviet Union began using rocket technology for scientific research in 1949. Initially, the problem of the stratosphere was studied, and later the problem of the ionosphere. Further scientific achievements have presented Soviet engineers with a new task—to conduct research in free cosmic space. Scientists first paid attention to the moon. Solving problems such as the strength of the moon's magnetic field and its radioactivity is of great significance. The Soviet rocket's research program launched in the direction of the moon included these issues. Blagonravov emphasized the difficulty of this launch. He said that it requires particularly accurate control of the rocket. Even a slight error of a few minutes in the time when the last stage of the rocket enters orbit or a slight error in speed will lead to failure. Blagonravov cited the failure of the US lunar rocket launch in October 1958 as an example. The US rocket failed because it lost only 2% of its speed.

Academician Blagonravov believes that the accuracy of the instrument's work is an extremely important new advancement in Soviet rocket technology. He finally said that there is no place in cosmic space that cannot be reached. Of course, this takes time, but we don't have to wait long.

Professor Muschel, Chairman of the Solar Observation Committee and corresponding academician of the Academy of Sciences, talked about the significance of cosmic rockets for studying the sun at the press conference. He said that only after this rocket was launched did the possibility of studying solar particles that are not affected by the Earth appear for the first time.

Muschel went on to say that the Soviet cosmic rocket helps solve the problem of the state of interplanetary gas. This also brings certain problems in celestial evolution, such as the origin of stars and planets, closer to a solution.

When talking about using rockets to detect the moon's magnetic field, Corresponding Academician Muschel said that this launch may confirm the hypothesis that the magnetic field of celestial bodies is related to their rotation.

In answering questions from reporters, Academician Blagonravov said that the scientific results obtained after processing the information transmitted by the rocket will become the wealth of the scientific community worldwide. When a reporter asked whether the Soviet rocket was a missile, Academician Blagonravov gave an affirmative answer. When talking about the quality of the instruments installed on the rocket, Academician Blagonravov refuted the claims of some American scientists, who insisted that the instruments installed on the Soviet cosmic rocket were not as good as those used by the Americans.

When talking about the mission of Soviet scientists launching rockets, Academician Blagonravov emphasized that the purpose of Soviet scientists was not to make the rocket fall on the moon. He said that the information obtained by the rocket passing through the lunar area as we expected is wider than the range of information that could be obtained by the rocket directly falling on the moon. Academician Blagonravov said that if you look at it from a sensational perspective, there may be controversy over the question of which is more important, making the rocket fall on the moon or creating an artificial planet.

Academician Blagonravov emphasized that the successful launch of the Soviet lunar rocket was the Soviet Union's first attempt in this regard. When asked whether there had been any failures in launching rockets towards the moon before, he answered in the negative. When asked whether the Soviet Union had ever had anyone sit in a rocket for experimental flights to a low space, he also answered in the negative. Academician Blagonravov said that we will wait until we are completely sure that people can return to Earth before doing so. He added that unmanned rocket flight is possible in principle.

Professor Kukarkin, Executive Chairman of the International Astronomical Association, told reporters about the possibility that in the future, the Soviet artificial planet may approach the Earth at a relatively close distance, at which time it may be possible to observe it. When talking about reaching the third cosmic velocity (at this velocity, the spacecraft can go beyond the solar system), Professor Kukarkin emphasized that this is not a difficult task.

    苏联科学家介绍宇宙火箭的科学技术成就
    红色行星诞生是人类最豪迈壮举
    宇宙火箭已离开地球八十万公里实际上已进入行星轨道
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联科学院副院长托普切夫院士6日在记者招待会上说，发射第一个宇宙火箭和制造第一个人造行星是科学技术的顶峰，从此就打开了征服行星际空间的广阔前景。因此，世界公众对这一杰出的事件的积极反应是十分自然的。它是人类曾经设想过并实现了的一个最豪迈的壮举。
    这个记者招待会是苏联国家对外文化委员会和苏联科学院主席团为成功地发射了第一个宇宙火箭而举行的。
    托普切夫院士说，第一个宇宙火箭1月4日五时五十九分飞过了离月球最近的距离，即大约等于月球两个直径的距离。现在苏联火箭离开地球已经有八十万公里，离开月球有五十万公里。这样，苏联宇宙火箭实际上已进入第一个人造行星的椭圆形轨道。
    托普切夫院士说，发射宇宙火箭和造成第一个人造行星是人类智慧第一次克服地球引力方面的一个巨大成就。
    托普切夫院士说，当1957年10月4日发射第一个人造地球卫星的时候，一些外国评论家企图硬说，这是偶然的成功，或者把它说成是苏联在整个技术落后的背景上创造的一个纪录。现在，这些说法全都破产了。
    托普切夫院士说，第十个行星——苏联第一个人造太阳卫星集中了无线电电子学、遥控力学、冶金学、化学、自动装置、热工学和许多其他部门的最新成就。我们创造成功了在几分钟内就能够达到宇宙速度的强有力的喷气式发动机。制造了最精确的自动设备，保证进行准确的测量，并把各种情报传送到几十万公里的地方。托普切夫院士强调指出，只有技术上最发达的国家才有能力做到这一切。
    接着，布拉冈拉沃夫院士说，苏联从1949年开始利用火箭技术进行科学研究。起初研究同温层问题，后来研究电离层问题。科学的进一步的成就在苏联工程师面前提出了一项新的任务——在自由的宇宙空间进行研究。科学家们首先注意到月球。解决月球磁场强度及其放射性等问题是具有巨大意义的。向月球方向发射的苏联火箭的研究计划中就包括了这些问题。布拉冈拉沃夫强调指出了这种发射的困难之处。他说，为此需要特别准确地控制火箭。只要火箭最后一级进入轨道的时间稍微差错几分钟或速度上有细小差错，就会导致失败。布拉冈拉沃夫在这里引用了美国1958年10月发射月球火箭失败作为例子。美国火箭在速度上只失去了2％便遭到失败。
    布拉冈拉沃夫院士认为，仪器工作的准确性是苏联火箭技术的异常重要的新进步。他最后说，宇宙空间中没有不可能达到的地方。当然，这需要时间，但是不必等待多久了。
    太阳观测委员会主席、科学院通讯院士穆斯切尔在记者招待会上谈了关于宇宙火箭对研究太阳的意义。他说，这支火箭发射后才第一次出现了研究不受地球影响的太阳微粒的可能。
    穆斯切尔接着说，苏联宇宙火箭有助于解决行星际气体状态的问题。这样也就使某些天体演化学上的问题，如恒星和行星的起源问题接近解决。
    在谈到用火箭去探测月球磁场的问题时，穆斯切尔通讯院士说，这次发射火箭可能证实天体磁场与其自转有关的假设。
    布拉冈拉沃夫院士在回答记者问题时说，在处理火箭传来的情报后而获得的科学结果，将成为全世界科学界的财富。记者问，苏联火箭是不是导弹，布拉冈拉沃夫院士做了肯定的回答。布拉冈拉沃夫院士在谈到火箭上装置的仪器的质量时驳斥了某些美国科学家的说法，他们硬说，苏联宇宙火箭所装置的仪器抵不上美国人所用的仪器。
    在谈到苏联科学家发射火箭的任务时，布拉冈拉沃夫院士强调指出，苏联科学家的目的并不是要使火箭落到月球上。他说，火箭像我们所预想的那样，经过月球附近区域所获得的情报比火箭直接落到月球上可能获得的情报范围要广。布拉冈拉沃夫院士说，关于使火箭落到月球上和创造人造行星哪个更为重要些的问题，如果从耸人听闻的角度来看，可能是有争论的。
    布拉冈拉沃夫院士强调指出，成功地发射苏联月球火箭，是苏联在这方面的第一次尝试。有人问，在此以前，向月球方向发射火箭曾否有过失败，他对这个问题作了否定的回答。还有人问，苏联是否曾经有人坐火箭到不高的空间作试验性飞行，他对这个问题也作了否定的回答。布拉冈拉沃夫院士说，我们要等完全有把握使人可以返回地球的时候，才这样做。他补充说，无人操纵火箭飞行，在原理上是可能的。
    国际天文协会执行主席库卡尔金教授对记者谈到这样的可能性：将来苏联人造行星可能在比较近的距离内靠近地球，那时候便有可能对它进行观测。库卡尔金教授在谈到关于达到第三宇宙速度（在这种速度下，宇宙飞船便可以越出太阳系范围）时强调指出，这并不是一个困难的任务。
