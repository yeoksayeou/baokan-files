    Folk Songs Paved the Way for New Poetry
    Tian Jian
    I just returned from Changli not long ago. There, I saw that the county party secretary and many heroic model figures, and "Three Good" commune members had written many poems. It truly is "Ten thousand pens wave for the Great Leap Forward, heroes sing heroic songs." Their poems are their own statements of determination.
    As for the poetic form they created, it is generally the five- and seven-character verse form, the new folk songs of the Great Leap Forward. The forms are still diverse, and most of the works are relatively long poems. "Singing of the Nine Gullies and Eighteen Valleys" is nearly one hundred lines long. Sanlan's poem is in the form of a chorus, nearly forty lines long.
    Some comrades asked me if these poems are new poetry. I said that this is new poetry, and also new folk songs, an important part of new poetry. Our classical poetry includes some Yuefu poems. It can be seen here that whether in the past or now, new poetry and folk songs are always closely connected and mutually influence each other. But in every era, folk songs always pave the way for new poetry and serve as a foundation for the development of new poetry. Because one of the characteristics of folk songs is that they are the creations of the working people themselves, and they are connected to labor and the thoughts and language of the people by flesh and blood. The form of new poetry, that is, the language structure, rhythm, style, and rhyme of poetry, must be consistent with the requirements of the broad masses. To achieve this, folk songs are one of the important sources. New poetry must also learn from folk songs to become the horn of the people ideologically. Comrade Zhou Yang said that new folk songs have opened up new paths for new poetry. This is indeed the case. Developing new poetry on the basis of classical poetry and folk songs should be our direction. Under the call of the Party, various places have compiled many collections of new folk songs, which is an important task for the popularization and improvement of poetry.
    Some people love to talk about development but don't love to talk about the foundation, or they deliberately distort the facts and misunderstand the foundation. New poetry must have a foundation, and naturally it must also develop, innovate, and let a hundred flowers bloom. But first, there must be a foundation. Building castles in the air is not feasible. There are often some disputes on this issue. Recently, Comrades Zhang Guangnian and Sha Ou have written articles, and their general views are of positive significance. Comrade Sha Ou's article mentioned Comrade Li Yaqun's opinions. I have not seen Li's article and cannot say much. However, I think that even if Li's wording has shortcomings, it cannot be regarded as a trend. Comrade Zhang Guangnian's article has some very good views. He said that revolutionary poets are now in charge. I think that's right. Since the Great Leap Forward, the vigorous development of new folk songs has been like mountains and seas; many poets have further studied folk songs, their poetic styles have taken on a new look, and the policy of new poetry serving the revolution, workers, peasants, and soldiers has been easier to implement. Judging from the current development of new poetry, this is an important aspect.
    In addition, there are some phenomena that are worth studying and discussing. For example, some people actually hold a contemptuous attitude towards studying the traditions of their national poetry. They emphasize inheriting the tradition of "May Fourth" new poetry indiscriminately. The two articles by Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin have caused controversy, and the main reason is precisely this. Comrade Bian Zhilin said at this symposium that he does not despise folk songs, but judging from his speech this time, he still does not attach importance to the influence of folk songs. It is also inappropriate to separate the poetic form from language, rhyme, and techniques. He only made some new additions to the basic issue near the end of his speech. I think our discussion should not be caught up in the wording, but should focus on the essence of the problem.
    We must have a scientific analysis of the new poetry of the May Fourth period. Generally speaking, foreign influence was very great. The Crescent Moon Society and Symbolist School at that time were the most prominent representatives (although their individual situations were not exactly the same). Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, some poets who advocated the popularization of poetry had struggles with these poetry schools. Some good poets, their works also have various foreign influences, and the combination of works and the masses has been limited. Although these works have foreign influences, they also have the influence of their own national poetry tradition. For example, Guo Moruo's "The Goddess," Jiang Guangci, Yin Fu, and others' works, Ke Zhongping's "Fenghuoshan," Xiao San's "Nanjing Road," Zang Kejia's "Brand," Pu Feng's "Life," Yuan Shuipai's "The Mountain Songs of Mafanto," and some other works. I also think that some of the lyrics written by Comrade Tian Han and Comrade Guang Weiran can also be counted within the scope of new poetry.
    After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, some poets went deep into the masses and struggles, actively studied folk songs, and wrote in the language of the masses, and new poetry took another step forward. "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Zhanghe River Water," "Can't Die," and many street poems and gun poems appeared. "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" has important gains and influences in the use of folk songs.
    As mentioned above, precisely because of these works, on the one hand, they are progressive ideologically, and on the other hand, they have more or less the influence of national traditions, so new poetry has life and can continue to develop forward. He Qifang's poetry theory written in 1954, as well as the article published in "Virgin Land," neglected the important significance of classical poetry and folk songs for the development of new poetry. When he talked about the establishment of new metrical poetry, he emphasized the limitations of the folk song form and insisted on establishing modern metrical poetry outside of them, opposing folk songs and new metrical poetry. In addition, he also said that it is necessary to absorb the experience of rhythm and foot from classical poetry, believing that this is the core of absorbing the form of classical poetry. In fact, metrical poetry has a certain rhythm and foot, which is not entirely a characteristic of Chinese poetry. In addition to this, Chinese poetry also has other characteristics in its language structure. A poem or a section of a poem, the language is very refined, the meaning is very rich, the independence is relatively large, one or two lines can constitute a relatively complete image, can convey profound thoughts, there are few detours, it is easy to spread and remember, and the implicit and clear are unified, and so on. The reason for this is related to the language of the people. The five- and seven-character verse form has a certain representativeness. Chinese poetry lines are not all five or seven characters per line, but most of them are related to this poetic form. He Qifang believes that this poetic form is based on classical Chinese and does not come from the language of the people. This is very worthy of discussion.
    Fundamentally speaking, poetry should be the language of heroes, to express fighting spirit and encourage people to move forward. Chairman Mao's poems best illustrate this point. The new folk songs of the Great Leap Forward can also illustrate this point. Many excellent poems in Chinese history can also illustrate this point. Many advantages of Chinese classical poetry and folk songs remain to be explored, inherited, and developed by us.
    Chinese folk songs are a vast ocean. There are various short sentences, and there are also various long poems. It is not just four-line poems, as some people say. The folk songs of fraternal nationalities are even more colorful in form, and we can draw on them inexhaustibly. There are many places to learn from and adopt when creating new metrical poetry. Some comrades have also made efforts and have had certain effects. He Qifang also believes that we do not have any new metrical poetry, saying that the path of modern metrical poetry is very broad, but unfortunately, few people are willing to try. I think that since we have old-style metrical poetry, we will certainly have new metrical poetry, and there is no need to be pessimistic. New metrical poetry must also be diverse and colorful in form, and there will be cases of breaking the rules and incomplete stereotypes (that is, the rhythm of each line of a poem is not completely equal). In the past, in the era when regulated verse prevailed, there were also many regulated verses that broke the rules, and it is even more inevitable for us now.
    Many new folk songs now are new metrical poems. Others such as Zang Kejia's "I am a Red Rocket," Guang Weiran's "Journey to the Border," some poems written by Guo Xiaochuan during his visit to the Soviet Union, He Jingzhi's "Sanmenxia Song," Xing Ye's many street poems, Yuan Ying's "A Lebanese Child," and some poems by Comrades Wen Jie, Yan Zhen, and Ding Mang can all be roughly regarded as new metrical poems or folk song poems. Although not very mature, in the process of development, it must be recognized first. To illustrate the problem, I have given these examples. This is not to be regarded as a masterpiece, let alone as a fixed poetic form. We have new metrical poetry, and He Qifang's statement is that "few people are willing to try." This also shows what basis he requires to explore the form of new poetry. Some of the examples I gave above are written using the five- and seven-character verse form (not entirely according to the old form); some are written under the direct influence of classical poetry and folk songs, and the changes are relatively large. I think both are possible and have a future for development. Many authors, each of them has made efforts in these aspects. If we want to do better, in addition to strengthening ties with the masses, we must continue to learn from new folk songs. Our learning should be both deep and broad, and we should avoid narrowness. We should also study foreign poetry, such as Soviet poetry.
    We must do our best to make the form of new poetry meet the requirements of the broad masses, make the works easy for the masses to accept, at least have the possibility of being accepted by the masses, and reach a high level in terms of ideology and art, and climb a new peak!

    民歌为新诗开辟了道路
    田间
    我刚从昌黎回来不久。在那里看到了县委书记和许多英雄模范人物、三好社员写了许多诗。真是“万笔齐挥大跃进，英雄高唱英雄歌”。他们的诗作，就是自己的决心书。
    至于他们创作的诗体，一般是五七言诗体，大跃进的新民歌。形式还是多种多样的，多数作品，是比较长的诗。“说唱九沟十八峪”近一百行。三兰的诗，是合唱的形式，近四十行。
    有个别同志问我，这些诗，是不是新诗？我说这就是新诗，也是新民歌，是新诗重要的一部分。我们的古典诗歌中，就包括一部分乐府诗。这里可以看出，无论过去或现在，新诗和民歌总是密切相连的，互为影响的。但在每一个时代中，民歌总是为新诗开路，为新诗发展的一个基础。因为民歌的特点之一，它是劳动人民自己的创作，它和劳动、和人民的思想语言，血肉相连。新诗的形式，即诗的语言结构、节奏、体式、韵律各方面，要和广大群众的要求相一致。要想达到这一点，民歌是重要的来源之一。新诗在思想上要成为人民的号角，也必须向民歌学习。周扬同志说过，新民歌为新诗歌开辟了新的道路。确实是这样的。在古典诗歌和民歌的基础上发展新诗，应该是我们的方向。在党的号召下，各地编选了很多的新民歌集，这就是诗歌普及和提高的一项重要工作。
    有一些人，很爱谈发展，不爱谈基础，或者指鹿为马，把基础看错了。新诗要有基础，自然也要发展，要推陈出新，百花齐放。但首先得有基础。空中楼阁是不行的。在这个问题上，常有一些争执。最近，张光年、沙鸥等同志写了文章，他们总的看法，是有积极意义的。沙鸥同志的文章，提到李亚群同志的意见，我没有看到李的文章，不便多说什么。不过，我想即便李的提法上有缺点，还不能作为一种倾向来看。张光年同志的文章，有些看法很好，他说现在是革命诗人当了家。我看是这样的。大跃进以来，新民歌的蓬勃发展，如山似海；许多诗人进一步学习了民歌，诗风有了新的气象，新诗为革命、为工农兵服务的方针，易于贯彻了。就目前新诗发展的情况来看，这是重要的一面。
    另外，也还有一些现象，值得研究和讨论。例如有些人，对自己民族诗歌传统的学习，实际上是抱着轻视的态度。不分青红皂白地强调继承“五四”新诗的传统。何其芳、卞之琳同志的两篇文章，引起大家的争论，主要的原因，也正在此。卞之琳同志在这次座谈会上说，他并不轻视民歌，但就他这次的发言来看，依然没有重视民歌的影响。把诗体和语言、韵律、手法等分割开来看，也不妥当。他在发言快结束时，对基础问题才有了一些新的补充。我想，我们的讨论，不要在词句上兜圈子，要着重问题的实质。
    我们对五四时期的新诗，要有科学的分析。一般说，外来影响是很大的。当时的新月派和象征派等，是最突出的代表（虽然他们之中，各人的情况不尽相同）。抗日战争以前，主张诗歌大众化的一些诗人，和这些诗派有过斗争。一些好的诗人，他们的作品，也有各种各样的外来影响，作品和群众的结合，就有了限制。这些作品中，虽有外来影响，同时还有自己民族诗歌传统的影响。例如郭沫若的“女神”，蒋光慈、殷夫等的作品，柯仲平的“风火山”，萧三的“南京路上”等诗，臧克家的“烙印”，蒲风的“生活”，袁水拍的“马凡陀的山歌”，以及其他人的一些作品。我还以为，田汉同志和光未然同志写的一部分歌词，也可以算在新诗的范围以内。
    延安文艺座谈会以后，有一些诗人，深入群众和斗争，积极地学习民歌，用群众的语言写作，新诗又前进了一步。出现“王贵与李香香”、“漳河水”、“死不着”和许多街头诗、枪杆诗。“王贵与李香香”在运用民歌方面，有其重要的收获和影响。
    如上所述，正因为有这些作品，一方面思想上是进步的，另一方面，或多或少具有民族传统的影响，新诗才有了生命，得以继续向前发展。何其芳同志在1954年写的诗论，以及在“处女地”发表的文章，忽视了古典诗歌和民歌对新诗发展的重要意义。当他谈到新格律诗的建立时，强调民歌体的限制性，一定要在它们之外建立现代格律诗，把民歌和新格律诗对立起来。此外，他倒也说过，要吸收古典诗歌中节奏和顿数的经验，以为这是吸取古典诗歌形式的核心。其实，格律诗有一定的节奏和顿数，这也并非完全是中国诗的特点。中国诗除这以外，还有自己语言结构上的其他特点。一个诗句，或一段诗，语言非常精炼，含义又很多，独立性比较大，一两个诗句，能构成较为完整的形象，能传达深刻的思想，拐弯抹角的地方少，易于传诵和记忆，含蓄和明朗是统一的，等等。其所以如此，这是和人民的语言有关。五七言诗体，有其一定的代表性。中国诗的诗句，并不都是五字七字一句的，但多半又和这种诗体有关系。何其芳同志认为这种诗体是建立在文言的基础上的，不是来自人民群众的语言。这就很值得讨论。
    从根本上来说，诗歌应该是英雄的语言，要抒发斗志、鼓舞人们前进。毛主席的诗词，最能说明这一点。大跃进的新民歌，也能说明这一点。中国历代许多优秀的诗篇，也能说明这一点。中国古典诗和民歌的许多优点，还有待我们继续仔细地去探索、继承它，并且加以发展。
    中国的民歌，是一个浩大的海洋。有各种短句，也有各种长诗。并不是像有些人所说，只是四行诗。兄弟民族的民歌，形式上更是丰富多彩，我们取之不竭，用之不尽。要创作新格律诗，可借鉴的地方，可采取的地方，是很多的。也曾有一些同志做了努力，有一定的效果。何其芳同志还认为，我们没有什么新格律诗，说是现代格律诗的路子很宽，可惜没有什么人肯尝试。我看我们既然有旧体的格律诗，当然会有新格律诗，用不着悲观。新格律诗也一定是形式上多种多样，丰富多彩，破格的和不完全定型的情况（即一首诗各个诗行的节奏并不完全相等），也会有的。过去律诗盛行的时代，还有许多破格的律诗，我们现在更难免。
    现在的许多新民歌，就是新格律诗。其他如，臧克家的“我是红色火箭”，光未然的“塞上行”，郭小川访苏写的某些诗，贺敬之的“三门峡歌”，邢野的许多街头诗，袁鹰的“黎巴嫩一小孩”，以及闻捷、严阵、丁芒等同志的一些诗，大致都可算作新格律诗，或民歌体的诗。虽然不十分成熟，在发展的过程中，总得先承认它。为了说明问题，我举了这一些例子。这并不当做代表作来说的，更不当做定型的诗体来谈的。我们是有了新格律诗的，何其芳同志的说法是“很少人肯尝试”。这也可见他要求在什么基础上来探索新诗的形式。我在上面所举的一些例子，有的是采用了五七言诗体（并非完全按照旧体）来写作的；有的是在古典诗歌和民歌直接影响下来写作的，变化较为大些。我以为都可以的，都有发展的前途。许多作者，每一个人自己在这几方面都做过努力。倘若要做得更好一些，除了要加强和群众的联系而外，还得继续向新民歌学习。我们的学习，既要深，又要宽广，要避免狭隘。外国诗，例如苏联的诗歌，我们也应该学习。
    我们要尽可能做到，让新诗的形式符合广大群众的要求，作品易于为群众所接受，至少要有可能为群众所接受，并在思想上艺术上达到高度的水平，攀上一个新的高峰！
