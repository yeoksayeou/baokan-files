Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Continuing to exert full effort, launching another one or several shock procurement campaigns, and striving to basically complete the 1958 annual agricultural product procurement plan before the Spring Festival is a very urgent task in current financial and trade work. Relevant leaders of the State Council made a statement to our agency reporter on this issue today.

The responsible person said that since the launch of various agricultural product procurement efforts in September of last year, thanks to the attention of Party committees at all levels, the mobilization of the broad masses, and the adoption of a combination of large-scale movements and small-scale movements, regular procurement and shock procurement, the national agricultural product procurement work has achieved great success. As of the end of last year, the national grain procurement plan had been 75.92% completed, an increase of 24.2% compared to the same period in 1957; cotton had completed 77.9% of the annual plan, an increase of 76.4% compared to the same period in 1957; flue-cured tobacco had completed 81.7% of the annual plan, an increase of 1.36 times compared to the same period in 1957. The procurement volume of live pigs, ramie, and hemp has increased to varying degrees compared to 1957. The development of the movement is healthy, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to sell agricultural products to the state after the people's communes has been very high, thus forming an unprecedented upsurge of thousands of troops and horses delivering grain and cotton to the state.

The responsible person said that although the agricultural product procurement work has achieved great success, it is still very unbalanced in terms of variety and region. The procurement of some varieties is not good enough. For example, oil crops only completed about 35% of the plan by the end of October last year, which is lower than the procurement volume in the same period in 1957, and the procurement plan for jute has not been completed; regionally, some areas have completed or are close to completing the annual procurement plan, while some areas are far behind. Generally speaking, the progress of the entire agricultural product procurement work has been slow since December of last year, and the procurement volume has decreased somewhat. Some of this decline is due to normal factors, such as some areas having completed or are close to completing the procurement task, and the procurement volume cannot be as high as in the past; most areas are conducting major inspections, major cleanups, and major account settlements of the agricultural products procured in the previous stage, and the procurement volume cannot increase as much as in the past. More importantly, all localities are rectifying the people's communes, and their strength cannot be taken into account for a while, but it is worth noting that some areas have begun to show some slackness in the procurement work, and have not seized the opportunity to procure all that should be procured, which is a major obstacle to completing the annual procurement task.

The responsible person continued, currently there is only one month left before the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, busy spring plowing production will begin, and rural labor will shift more to production, so it is necessary to seize this period of time and launch one or several shock procurement movements in those areas that have not completed the task, for those varieties that have not been procured well, and strive to basically complete the annual procurement task before the Spring Festival. The responsible person pointed out that it is possible to complete the annual procurement task before the Spring Festival. In 1958, China's grain, cotton, and oil crops all achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, and the commodity rates of various agricultural products procured by the state were set relatively low. Therefore, on the basis of the bumper harvest and with the increased political awareness of the broad masses of people's commune members, as long as Party committees at all levels attach importance to it, make careful arrangements, and carry forward the successful experience of the previous stage, continuing to carry out one or several shock procurement movements, it is entirely possible to complete the annual procurement plan.

The responsible person also requested all localities to seize the harvesting work while seizing shock procurement, and reorganize manpower to collect the agricultural products that were lost in the past due to rough harvesting. This can not only collect more products, but also protect the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, so that the fruits of the masses' labor are not wasted. The responsible person finally emphasized that the principle of grasping both the large and the small, grasping both the domestic and the wild, grasping both the "named" and the "unnamed" should be consistently implemented throughout the entire agricultural product procurement work. Strive to comprehensively complete the procurement task of agricultural and sideline products to meet the needs of all parties. (Attached image)

### 抓紧时机再来一次或几次突击运动  春节前把农产品收购齐全  国务院有关方面负责人号召如期完成年度计划

    抓紧时机再来一次或几次突击运动
    春节前把农产品收购齐全
    国务院有关方面负责人号召如期完成年度计划
    新华社11日讯　继续鼓足干劲，再搞一次或几次突击收购运动，力争在春节以前基本完成1958年度的农产品收购计划，这是当前财贸工作中一项十分紧迫的任务。国务院有关方面负责人今天就这个问题对本社记者发表了谈话。
    负责人说，自从去年9月展开各项农产品收购工作以来，由于各级党委的重视，发动了广大群众，又采取了大运动套小运动，经常收购和突击收购相结合的方式，全国农产品收购工作已经取得了很大成绩。截止去年年底，全国粮食收购计划已经完成75.92％，比1957年同期增加24.2％；棉花完成全年计划的77.9％，比1957年同期增加76.4％；烤烟完成年计划的81.7％，比1957年同期增加一点三六倍。生猪、苎麻、大麻的收购量都比1957年有不同程度的增加。运动的发展是健康的，人民公社化以后广大社员向国家交售农产品的热情十分高涨，因此形成了从所未有的千军万马向国家交粮送棉的热潮。
    负责人说，农产品收购工作虽然取得了很大成绩，但是在品种上，地区上还很不平衡，有的品种收购得还不够好，如油料截止去年10月底只完成计划的35％左右，还低于1957年同期的收购量，黄麻的收购计划也没有完成；在地区上，有一部分地区已经完成或接近完成全年收购计划，有的地区还相差很远。总的说来，整个农产品收购工作自去年12月份以来，进展都比较迟缓，收购量有些下降。这种下降的情况有一些是正常的因素，如部分地区已经完成或接近完成收购任务，收购量当然不可能像过去那么多；大部分地区正在对前一阶段收购的农产品进行大检查、大清理、大结账，收购数量也不可能像过去那样大量增长。更重要的是，各地正在整顿人民公社，力量一时还顾及不来，但是值得注意的是部分地区对收购工作开始产生了一些松劲情绪，没有抓紧时机把应该收购的都收购上来，这是完成全年收购任务的一个很大的障碍。
    负责人接着说，目前距离春节只有一个月的时间，春节以后繁忙的春耕生产就要开始，农村劳动力会更多地转向生产方面，因此必须抓紧这一段时间，在那些没有完成任务的地区，对于那些收购得不好的品种，展开一次或几次突击收购运动，力争在春节以前基本上完成全年的收购任务。负责人指出，要在春节以前完成全年收购任务是有可能的。1958年我国粮、棉和油料作物都获得了空前大丰收，而国家收购的各项农产品的商品率都定的较低。因此在大丰收的基础上，又在广大人民公社社员政治觉悟提高的情况下，只要各级党委重视，认真加以安排，并发扬前一阶段的成功经验，继续开展一次或几次突击收购运动，完成全年的收购计划是完全可能的。
    负责人还要求各地在抓紧突击收购的同时，抓一下收摘工作，把过去因收摘粗糙而丢失的农产品再组织人力收拾起来。这样不仅可以多收一些产品，而且保护了广大社员的生产积极性，使群众的劳动成果不致浪费。负责人最后强调在整个农产品收购工作中始终要贯彻既要抓大的，又要抓小的；既要抓家生的又要抓野生的；既要抓“有名有姓”的，也要抓“无名无姓”的办法。力求全面地完成农副产品收购任务，以满足各方面的需要。（附图片）
