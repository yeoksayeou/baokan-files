    New Products
    Mass Shoes
    The Wenzhou Tannery in Zhejiang has trial-produced a type of mass-market economy shoe. The uppers and soles of these leather shoes are made from the split layer of pigskin (sometimes cowhide is also used), and the soles are sewn with hemp rope like cloth shoe soles. These shoes are very inexpensive, costing only about three yuan per pair. According to trial wear results, under the same wearing conditions, one pair of mass-market leather shoes can last as long as two pairs of cloth shoes.
    Harbin has also produced shoes suitable for working in paddy fields; Beijing has also produced mass-market leather shoes suitable for urban workers. The Wuhan Leather Factory has further beautified pigskin by grinding the split layer into a suede finish, making its appearance similar to wool fabric. Due to the affordable prices, good quality, and durability of mass-market shoes, they are very popular among the masses.
    Pigskin Coats
    Coats, jackets, and gloves made of leather are not only windproof and warm, but also beautiful, elegant, and durable. Because the production of these products requires better quality cowhide or sheepskin, the output is limited, and the prices are relatively high. Last year, the Shanghai Yimin Tannery successfully trial-produced pigskin glove and coat leather, which is soft, with high elongation. Coats made from it are lighter and more comfortable than wool coats.
    Rabbit Fur Suede Shoes
    The Nanxun Detai Shun Tannery in Zhejiang has successfully trial-produced rabbit fur suede leather. This suede is very fine, like chamois leather, and can be used to imitate higher-end chamois leather shoes.
    Shark Leather
    Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places have successively trial-produced shark leather. Physical tests show that it is no less than pigskin, and it is even stronger than pigskin in terms of tensile strength and bursting strength. Shark skin also has beautiful patterns, making it suitable for manufacturing suitcases, handbags, wallets, etc.
    River Pig Leather
    River pigs are abundant in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Shanghai has successfully trial-produced river pig leather using river pig hides. Although the tensile strength is relatively low, the grain surface is dense, and it can replace sheepskin in the manufacture of various leather goods.

    大众鞋
    浙江温州制革厂试制出了一种大众经济鞋。这种皮鞋的鞋帮和鞋底都是用猪皮（有时也用牛皮）片下来的二层皮制成的，鞋底像做布鞋底一样用麻绳纳实。这种鞋的价格很便宜，每双只要三元左右。根据试穿结果，在同样的穿着条件下，一双大众皮鞋可顶两双布鞋穿。
    哈尔滨还制成了适合于水稻田工作的鞋；北京市也生产了适合于城市劳动人民穿用的大众皮鞋。武汉皮革厂更进一步把猪皮加以美化，将二层皮磨成绒面，使它的外表和呢绒一样。由于大众鞋价廉物美耐穿，很受群众欢迎。
    猪皮大衣
    用皮革制造的大衣、夹克、手套，不仅能够挡风御寒，而且美观大方，经久耐穿。由于制造这些产品需要用比较好的牛皮或羊皮，产量受到限制，价格也比较高。上海益民制革厂去年试制成功猪皮手套大衣革，纤维松软、延伸率大，做成的大衣，比呢绒的还要轻便、舒服。
    兔绒面皮鞋
    浙江南浔德泰顺制革厂试制成功了兔皮绒面皮。这种绒面很细致，和麂皮一样，可以仿制成比较高级的麂皮皮鞋。
    鲨鱼皮革
    上海、福建、广东等地先后试制成功了鲨鱼革，经物理检验，并不次于猪皮，在抗张强度和崩裂力方面比猪皮还强。鲨鱼皮还有很美的花纹图案，适于制造皮箱、皮包、皮夹等。
    江猪革
    江猪盛产于长江中游，上海用江猪皮试制成功江猪革，虽然抗张强度较低，但粒面紧密，可代替羊皮制造各种皮革制品。
