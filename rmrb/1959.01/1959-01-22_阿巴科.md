“Abako”

Because the Belgian colonial authorities prohibited the Congolese people from organizing political parties, the Congolese people could only conduct political activities under the guise of "associations" and "cultural organizations." "Abako" is one of the most influential and combative organizations of this type.

“Abako” is a cultural organization of the Lower Congo tribe (which accounts for 50% to 60% of the residents of Leopoldville). Its publicly stated purpose is to protect and develop the Lower Congo language. But in reality, it is a nationalist and patriotic organization. The current struggle of the Congolese people against colonialism was triggered by the Belgian authorities' suppression of the organization's plan to convene a meeting to discuss Congolese independence and opposition to racial discrimination.

The "Abako" organization was founded in 1948 and has a central committee. For ten years, it has been fighting to defend the political rights and interests of the Congolese people, and enjoys a high reputation among the Congolese people.

Its political主張 [zhǔzhāng] (主張 = "主張" in Traditional Chinese) are: "To demand independence and autonomy for the Congolese people," "The Congo is an indivisible whole, and there is no superior or inferior race in the Congo," "The complete independence of the Congo is the only peaceful solution that can coordinate and stabilize relations between Belgium and the Congo."

Kasa-Vubu, the chairman of the "Abako" organization, is the district chief of the Dendale district in the capital of the Congo, and was arrested by the Belgian authorities in this incident. The vice chairman is Daniel Kanza.

    “阿巴科”
    由于比利时殖民当局禁止刚果人民组织政党，因此，刚果人民只能在“协会”“文化组织”等名义下，进行政治活动。“阿巴科”即是这类组织中影响较大，斗争性较强的一个组织。
    “阿巴科”是下刚果部族（占利奥波德维尔城居民的50％至60％）的文化组织。它公开提出的宗旨，是保卫和发展下刚果族语言。但实际上，它是一个民族主义的爱国组织。这次刚果人民反殖民主义的斗争，即由于该组织拟召集会议讨论刚果独立和反对种族歧视问题而受到比利时当局镇压所触发的。
    “阿巴科”组织，成立于1948年，设有中央委员会。十年来一直为捍卫刚果人民政治权利和利益而斗争，在刚果人民中威信很高。
    它的政治主张是：“要求刚果人民独立和自治”，“刚果是一个不可分割的整体，在刚果无优等种族和劣等种族之分”，“刚果的完全独立是唯一可以协调和稳定比利时和刚果之间关系的和平解决办法”。
    “阿巴科”组织的主席卡萨·武布是刚果首府的旦达勒区区长，在这次事件中被比利时当局逮捕。副主席是丹尼尔·坎扎。
