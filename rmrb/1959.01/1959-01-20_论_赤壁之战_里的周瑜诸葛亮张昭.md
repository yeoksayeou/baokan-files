On Zhou Yu, Zhuge Liang, and Zhang Zhao in the "Battle of Red Cliffs"
Liu Mianzhi

In the Battle of Red Cliffs, Zhou Yu was the most outstanding figure.

Zhou Yu, courtesy name Gongjin, was from Shu County, Lujiang (now Lujiang, Anhui). He came from a family of officials and landlords. His great-uncle, Jing, and Jing's son, Zhong, both served as Grand Commandant (Taiwei) in the Han Dynasty. His paternal uncle was the Prefect of Danyang, and his father, Yi, was a magistrate of Luoyang.

From a young age, he was proficient in music. If there were any errors in the music being played, he would turn his head to notice. At the time, people sang of him, "When there's a mistake in the tune, Zhou Lang looks around."

At the age of twenty-four, he served under Sun Ce as a Jianwei Middle-Ranking General, leading 2,000 soldiers and 50 cavalry. He was young and handsome, and in Wu, everyone called him Zhou Lang.

He was the same age as Sun Ce. When Sun Jian raised an army to讨董卓(Tǎo Dǒng Zhuó) (punish Dong Zhuo), he placed his family in Shu. Zhou Yu was friends with Sun Ce and vacated a large house for them to settle in. He ascended to the hall and paid respects to Sun Ce's mother, who treated him like a son. He followed Sun Ce in attacking Wan, obtaining the two daughters of Lord Qiao, both of whom were of exceptional beauty. Sun Ce married Da Qiao, and Zhou Yu married Xiao Qiao, and the two became relatives. The poet's "The Copper Sparrow Terrace locks up the Two Qiaos in spring" is based on fact, although the timing is slightly off. The Copper Sparrow Terrace was completed in 210 AD, three years after the Battle of Red Cliffs.

In 200 AD, Sun Ce died. Zhou Yu led his troops to attend the funeral and, together with the Chief Clerk Zhang Zhao, took charge of affairs as the Central Protector of the Army and Chief Clerk. From then on, he became the leader of the Wu generals, and Sun Quan trusted him greatly.

In 202 AD, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao, and his military power grew daily. He wrote to Sun Quan, demanding that he send his children as hostages. The strategists were unable to decide. Zhou Yu believed that sending hostages would put them at Cao Cao's mercy, and at best, they would only receive a title of nobility, with a dozen servants, a few carriages, and horses. He decided not to send hostages.

In 208 AD, Cao Cao entered Jing Province, obtaining naval vessels and several hundred thousand infantry. Zhou Yu pointed out four reasons why Cao Cao was venturing into war: First, the northern territories were not yet pacified, and Ma Chao and Han Sui were still in Guanzhong, threatening Cao Cao's rear; second, the infantry from Qing and Xu provinces were not accustomed to naval warfare; third, the weather was extremely cold, and there was no straw for the horses; fourth, the soldiers from the north were not accustomed to the climate and would inevitably suffer from epidemics. He requested to lead 30,000 elite troops to Xia Kou to defeat Cao Cao.

Zhou Yu's subordinate, Huang Gai, suggested feigning surrender and launching a fire attack. Cao Cao's ships were linked together, stem to stern, perfectly positioned as the southeast wind picked up. Huang Gai released the ships, setting them on fire simultaneously, which spread to the shore, engulfing the camps. Smoke and flames filled the sky, and Cao Cao's army was defeated.

In this battle, Cao Cao's side claimed to have 830,000 troops, while Sun Quan only had 30,000. Even with the addition of Liu Bei and Liu Qi's forces, they only had about 50,000. Defeating the many with the few, and the weak overcoming the strong, wrote a glorious page in military history.

Contemporary evaluations of Zhou Yu include Liu Bei saying that he was "an outstanding talent in both civil and military strategy," Jiang Gan praising him for his "elegant demeanor and lofty ideals, which cannot be described in words," and Cheng Pu remarking that "befriending Zhou Gongjin is like drinking fine wine, unconsciously becoming intoxicated." Sun Quan mourned him, believing that he "possessed the qualities of a king's advisor, with extraordinary valor and courage, and insightful discussions." The Records of the Three Kingdoms describes him as having a magnanimous nature and great tolerance.

After the Battle of Red Cliffs, Zhou Yu became the Prefect of Nan Commandery, stationed in Jiangling, while Liu Bei took control of Jing Province, stationed in Gong'an. When Liu Bei came to see Sun Quan, Zhou Yu suggested keeping Liu Bei, believing him to be a枭雄(xiāo xióng) (a ruthless and ambitious person), with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as fierce generals who would not long remain subordinate. He proposed using a beauty trap, building a grand palace for him, showering him with beautiful women and entertainment, and diverting his attention. He suggested dividing Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, placing them under the command of Zhou Yu and others, and using them in battles, which would ensure success. If land were ceded to them, and the three were together, they would be uncontrollable. This view was in direct contrast to that of Lu Su. Sun Quan adopted Lu Su's policy of making an enemy of Cao Cao and an ally of Liu Bei, also fearing that he could not control Liu Bei, so he did not listen to Zhou Yu.

From this, it can be seen that Zhou Yu and Lu Su were in complete agreement on the policy of allying with Liu Bei to resist Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. However, they differed after the battle. Lu Su consistently advocated for the policy of allying with Liu Bei, while Zhou Yu advocated for swallowing Liu Bei to expand their power. These two different views were reflected in the relationship between Wu and Shu for decades to come, as well as in Wei's foreign policy towards Wu and Shu.

Zhuge Liang also came from a family of officials and landlords. His father served as the Assistant of Tai Mountain Commandery, and his paternal uncle was the Prefect of Yuzhang.

When Liu Bei was stationed in Xinye, he visited Zhuge Liang three times, asking him for his grand strategy. Zhuge Liang believed that Cao Cao possessed a million troops and was using the Emperor to command the lords, making it impossible to compete with him head-on. Sun Quan controlled Jiangdong, had ruled for three generations, with strategic advantages and loyal people, and was best used as an ally rather than being eliminated. Only Jing and Yi provinces could be taken. By befriending Sun Quan and preparing for a northern expedition, they could achieve hegemony. His views were completely in line with Lu Su's, despite the different times, places, and targets.

Upon being ordered to seek help from Sun Quan, he used words to provoke Sun Quan into resisting Cao Cao. He analyzed Cao Cao's military strength, stating that first, Cao Cao's troops were numerous but exhausted from their long journey; second, the people from the north were not accustomed to naval warfare; third, the people of Jing Province only submitted to Cao Cao out of fear of his military might, not out of genuine loyalty; and fourth, although Liu Bei had been defeated, he still had Guan Yu's elite naval force of 10,000 and 10,000 soldiers from Jiangxia, giving him considerable military strength. As long as they joined forces to defeat Cao Cao, the power of Jing and Wu would be strengthened, and a tripartite balance of power could be formed. His argument was largely similar to Zhou Yu's.

Just as Lu Su resolutely advocated for the Wu-Shu alliance, Zhuge Liang, in Shu, resolutely implemented the policy of allying with Wu to resist Wei until his death, advocating for friendship and alliance with Wu.

The antagonist in the Battle of Red Cliffs, and the opposite of Lu Su, was Zhang Zhao. This character is old, but new in the play, and very well added.

Zhang Zhao was from Pengcheng (now Xuzhou, Jiangsu). He could write clerical script, studied the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, and had read extensively. He was a scholar from the Central Plains. At the end of the Han Dynasty, he fled across the river to avoid the turmoil. Sun Ce appointed him as Chief Clerk and General Who Comforts the Army, entrusting all civil and military affairs to him. After Sun Ce's death, he entrusted his younger brother, Sun Quan, to Zhang Zhao, who remained as Chief Clerk and was greatly respected.

In the Battle of Red Cliffs, he was a proponent of surrender.

Jiangbiao (江南地区 The Jiangnan region) said that "When Sun Quan declared himself emperor, he held a grand banquet for the officials, crediting Zhou Yu. Zhang Zhao was about to speak, but Sun Quan stopped him, saying, 'If we had listened to Duke Zhang back then, we would be begging for food now.'"

Pei Songzhi held a different view, believing that Zhang Zhao's proposal, from another perspective, still made sense. He believed that Zhang Zhao never advocated for a tripartite division, but for unification. From this, it can be seen that the situation at the time was beneficial to the landlords and officials of Wu, but for the entire history and the people of the time, Cao Cao's unification would have been more beneficial. On the other hand, the division of Wu and Shu was still beneficial to the development of the southeast and southwest at that time. If there had been no Battle of Red Cliffs, and Sun Quan had surrendered to Cao Cao, with Liu Bei's isolated army without support, the unified situation would not have had to wait until 280 AD. For the people of that time, and for the development of production, it should have been an even better thing.

In my opinion, although Zhang Zhao appeared as an antagonist in the Battle of Red Cliffs, enhancing the atmosphere of the play, Pei Songzhi's views still make some sense when considering him as a historical figure.

Finally, arranging the ages of several main characters in the Battle of Red Cliffs is also quite interesting.

In that year:

　　Sun Quan　27 years old
　　Zhuge Liang　27 years old
　　Zhou Yu　34 years old
　　Lu Su　37 years old
　　Cao Cao　54 years old

Of the commanders of the Wu and Shu sides, Lu Su was the oldest, followed by Zhou Yu, but both were younger than Cao Cao. This battle was not only a case of inferior military strength defeating superior military strength, the defended military strength defeating the attacking military strength, and grief-stricken soldiers defeating arrogant soldiers, but also a case of the young defeating the old general.

### 论“赤壁之战”里的周瑜诸葛亮张昭

    论“赤壁之战”里的周瑜诸葛亮张昭
    刘勉之
    赤壁之战中，周瑜是个最出色的人物。
    周瑜字公瑾，庐江舒人（今安徽庐江），出身于官僚地主家庭，从祖景，景子忠都作汉朝太尉的大官，从父尚丹阳太守，父异作过洛阳令。
    他从小就精通音乐，奏乐有阙误，他就回顾，当时歌唱他：“曲有误，周郎顾。”
    二十四岁就在孙策部下，作建威中郎将，领兵二千人，骑五十匹，青年美貌，吴中都叫他作周郎。
    和孙策同年。孙坚起兵讨董卓，把家眷放在舒，周瑜和孙策友好，腾出一所大房子安顿，登堂拜母，孙策的母亲把他当儿子一样看待。随孙策攻皖，得乔公两女，都是国色，孙策娶了大乔，周瑜娶了小乔，两人又成了亲戚。诗人“铜雀春深锁二乔”是有根据的，只是时间略差一些，铜爵台成于公元二一○年，后于赤壁之战三年。
    公元二○○年孙策死，周瑜将兵赴丧，以中护军和长史张昭共掌众事，此后他就成为江东武将的首领，孙权十分信任。
    二○二年曹操破袁绍，兵威日盛，写信给孙权，要求送子弟作质子，谋臣商议不决。周瑜以为一送质子，便受制于人，最多不过落个封侯，有十几个仆从，几辆车，几匹马的下场。才决定不送质子。
    二○八年曹操入荆州，得水军船、步兵数十万。周瑜指出曹操冒用兵四患：一、北土未平，马超韩遂尚在关西，曹操后方受威胁；二，青徐步兵，不习水战；三，天气盛寒，马无藁草；四，北方士众，不服水土，必生疫病。自请领精兵三万人，进住夏口，击破曹操。
    周瑜部将黄盖献计诈降火攻，曹操船舰相连，首尾相接，正好东南风急，黄盖放船同时发火，延烧岸上营房，烟炎涨天，曹军大败。
    这一仗，曹操方面号称八十三万，孙权只有三万人，加上刘备刘琦的部队也不过五万人左右，以少败众，以弱胜强，在军事史上写下光辉的一页。
    当时人对周瑜的评论，刘备说他“文武筹略，万人之英。”蒋干称他“雅量高致，非言辞所能问。”程普以为“与周公瑾交，若饮醇醪，不觉自醉。”孙权痛悼他，以为“有王佐之资，雄烈胆略兼人，言议英发。”三国志说他性度恢廓，气量很大。
    赤壁战后，周瑜领南郡太守，屯江陵，刘备领荆州，屯公安。刘备来见孙权，周瑜建议留下刘备，以为刘备枭雄，又有关羽张飞熊虎之将，必不能久屈为人用，要用美人计，替他大造宫室，多其美女玩好，娱其耳目。分关张各置一方，配备在周瑜等部下，挟以攻战，大事可定。如割以土地，三人都在一起，恐不可制。议论恰好和鲁肃相反。孙权采纳了鲁肃的政策，为曹操树敌，为自己结援，也怕刘备制服不了，没有听他的话。
    由此可见，周瑜和鲁肃对联刘抗曹，在赤壁战前是完全一致的。在战后却有分歧，对联刘的政策鲁肃一贯坚持，周瑜却主张吞刘自大，这两派不同的主张，一直反映到以后吴蜀几十年的和战关系中，也反映到魏对吴蜀二国的对外关系。
    诸葛亮也是官僚地主家庭出身，父亲作过太山郡丞，从父是豫章太守。
    刘备屯新野，三顾茅芦，问以大计，诸葛亮以为曹操拥百万之众，挟天子以令诸侯，不可与争锋。孙权据有江东，已历三代，国险民附，善用贤才，只可为援而不可能消灭他。只有荆益可取。结好孙权，相机北伐，可成霸业。和鲁肃的见解，虽然时、地，对象不同，却完全吻合。
    他奉命求救于孙权，用话激孙权拒曹，最后分析曹操兵势，第一曹操兵虽多，却远来疲敝，第二北方之人，不习水战，第三荆州人民附操，是慑于兵势，并非心服，第四刘备虽败，还有关羽水军精甲万人和江夏战士万人，有相当兵力。只要合力破操，便荆吴之势强，鼎足之形成矣。和周瑜的论调也大体相似。
    正如鲁肃坚决主张吴蜀联盟一样，诸葛亮在蜀国，一直到他死，坚决贯彻联吴抗魏的方针，主张和吴国和好结援。
    在赤壁之战的反面人物，鲁肃的对立面是张昭。这个人物是旧的，但在戏里却是新的，添得甚好。
    张昭是彭城（今江苏徐州）人，会写隶书，治左氏春秋，博览众书，是个中原学者。汉末避难渡江，孙策任为长史抚军中郎将，文武之事，一以委昭。策死，以弟孙权托昭，仍任长史，极被尊重。
    在赤壁之战中，他是个投降派。
    江表传说他：“孙权称帝，大会百官，归功周瑜。张昭刚要说话，孙权拦住他，说：“当时要是听张公的话，现在只好讨饭了。”
    裴松之有不同的看法，认为张昭的主张从另一方面说，还是有道理的。他以为张昭原不主张鼎足三分，是主张统一的。由此看来，当时形势，对吴国的地主、官僚来说，分立有利，但对整个历史，对当时人民来说，曹操的统一，利益更大。另一面，吴蜀分立，对当时东南、西南的开发，也还是有利的。假使没有赤壁之战，孙权降曹，刘备孤军无援，统一的局面不要等到公元二八○年，对当时的人民来说，对生产的发展来说，应该是一件更大的好事。
    我看，张昭在赤壁之战中虽然以对立面出现，加强了这个戏的气氛，但作为历史人物来说，裴松之的意见还是有些道理的。
    最后，把赤壁之战中几个主要人物的年龄，排列一下，也很有趣味。
    这一年：
    孙　权　二十七岁
    诸葛亮　二十七岁
    周　瑜　三十四岁
    鲁　肃　三十七岁
    曹　操　五十四岁
    吴蜀两方的统帅，以鲁肃的年龄为最大，周瑜次之，但都比曹操小。这一仗不但是劣势的军力打败优势的军力，被攻的军力打败了进攻的军力，哀兵打败了骄兵，并且还是青年打败了老将。
