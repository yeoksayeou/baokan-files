An infantry squad on the Fujian front was transferred to a small island only two thousand meters away from the enemy. According to instructions from superiors, they were to conduct infantry training while simultaneously learning artillery techniques. In learning artillery skills, everyone was highly motivated, practicing whenever they had free time and asking questions whenever they forgot something. With the help of the artillerymen, in just over a month, they mastered the skills from the sixth artilleryman to the first artilleryman, becoming an all-around artillery squad, receiving praise from the artillery commanders.

One morning, as the soldiers were eating breakfast, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' artillery on Jinmen, Dadan, and Erdan Islands suddenly bombarded the island. The entire squad immediately joined the artillery comrades in combat, some acting as first artillerymen pulling the firing cord, some acting as third artillerymen loading shells, and some transporting ammunition. The soil at the rear of the gun mount of the cannon that squad leader Sun Jinfu was operating was soaked by rain and collapsed due to the recoil of the gun, seriously affecting the accuracy of the firing. In a critical moment, Sun Jinfu immediately used his hands and body to prop up the rear of the gun mount, resisting the shock of the four to five hundred jin recoil, ensuring the cannon continued to fire accurately. Seeing that the artillery commander was both directing and loading, affecting the firing speed, he quickly repaired the position of the gun mount's rear and ran to load shells, allowing the artillery commander to focus on directing. At the time, his ears were deafened by the blasts, but he still operated by watching the artillery commander's gestures, loading over forty shells in one go, ensuring the needs of the cannon's firing. In this way, in less than twenty minutes, they suppressed the enemy's artillery fire and destroyed two of the enemy's artillery positions.

Soon after, they participated in two more artillery battles. In the battles, two comrades received awards for promotion in military rank, one comrade received a third-class merit, and two comrades received commendations from superiors. Sun Jinfu received a second-class merit. They said: Infantrymen acting as artillerymen, displaying might in killing the enemy.

    步兵当炮兵　杀敌显威风
    福建前线某步兵班，调到了离敌人只有二千多公尺的一个小岛上。按照上级的指示，他们要一面进行步兵业务的训练，一面学习炮兵技术。在学习炮兵业务中，个个劲头十足，有空就练，忘了就问。在炮兵的帮助下，一个多月他们就学会了从六炮手到一炮手的技术，成为全能炮手班，受到炮兵首长的表扬。
    一天早晨，战士们正在吃早饭，金门和大、二担岛上的蒋军炮兵突然向这个岛上轰击。当时全班就立即同炮兵同志一起投入战斗，有的充当一炮手拉火，有的充当三炮手装填，有的运送弹药。班长孙进福参加的那门炮，炮角架尾的土，因受雨水冲泡，被火炮的后座力震塌了，射击命中精度受到严重影响。在危急时刻，孙进福便立即用双手和身子顶住炮角架尾，抵住了四、五百斤重的后座力的冲震，保证了火炮继续准确地射击。看到炮长又指挥又装填，影响发射速度，他又迅速整修好炮角架尾的位置，跑去装填炮弹，使炮长全力指挥。当时他的耳朵被震聋了，但他还是看着炮长的手势操作，一口气装完了四十多发炮弹，保证了火炮发射的需要。就这样，不到二十分钟，就把敌人的炮火压了下去，摧毁了敌人两个炮兵阵地。
    不久，他们又参加了两次炮战。在战斗中，有两个同志受晋升军衔的奖励，一个同志立三等功，两个同志受上级嘉奖，孙进福立了二等功。他们说：步兵当炮兵，杀敌显威风。
