Indigo Blue Comes From Blue, Yet Excels Blue
Ji Xiaofeng

Students learn from teachers and surpass them; students respect teachers and also criticize them; teachers and students are equal, and teachers also lead students; teachers and students engage in debate, learning from each other and growing together, uniting and helping each other, and working together to develop science and culture. This is a new phenomenon that has emerged in schools during the rectification movement and the teaching reform movement. This phenomenon marks the preliminary establishment of a new type of socialist teacher-student relationship based on democracy and unity. It will have a profound impact on the development of China's cultural and educational undertakings.

Regarding this new type of teacher-student relationship, especially the fact that students can criticize teachers, some people are not so accustomed to it all of a sudden, and are not so comfortable. They always feel: Can this be considered respecting teachers and valuing the Way? How will students be educated in the future? For thousands of years, teachers and students have been in an unequal position. Teachers reprimanding students was considered a matter of course, while students criticizing teachers was considered rebellious and unrighteous. The constraints of this traditional force of habit make it difficult for people to break free all at once, which is understandable.

It is a matter of course that students should learn from teachers and accept their guidance; this was the case in the past, is the case today, and will be the case ten thousand years from now. Students and teachers are equal before the truth, and students can criticize teachers. This was considered unreasonable and abnormal in the old society, but it is considered reasonable and normal under the socialist system, and therefore it is also a matter of course; this is the case today, and will be the case ten thousand years from now.

In fact, students learning from teachers and surpassing them has been the case since ancient times, which is called "Indigo Blue Comes From Blue, Yet Excels Blue." This is an objective truth. The important question is to have a correct understanding of the relationship between "coming from blue" and "excelling blue," and between "learning from teachers" and "surpassing teachers."

People who are superstitious about the ancients always do not believe that people today can surpass the ancients; people who are superstitious about teachers always do not believe that students can surpass teachers. According to these people's "logic," people can only become worse from one generation to the next, and society can only "be worse than the past." Such people can be called "Old Woman Nine-Catty." Last year, Chairman Mao called on us to break superstitions and liberate our minds, opening our minds. The communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, once combined with the spirit of scientific analysis, created miracles everywhere, making us believe that people today can surpass the ancients and that students can surpass teachers, thereby promoting further liberation of thought.

Today, have our minds been liberated thoroughly enough? Of course, we cannot say that yet. Aren't some people saying: Students can surpass teachers in certain technologies, but students cannot surpass teachers in theory; therefore, the task of breaking superstitions and liberating our minds has not been completed.

However, there is also another aspect of the problem that deserves attention. That is, we cannot only see "Indigo Blue Excels Blue" and "Surpassing Teachers" without emphasizing "Indigo Blue Comes From Blue" and "Learning From Teachers."

It is not easy for students to surpass teachers and for people today to surpass the ancients. Take the teaching outlines compiled by students during the teaching reform as an example. Some of them are indeed far superior to those of the teachers, but this involves the leadership of the Party, the strength of the masses, and also the role of the teachers. Without the leadership of the Party, we cannot break superstitions and liberate our minds, and we cannot "dare to think, speak, and act"; without the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics, and education combined with productive labor," we cannot have the correct direction in compiling outlines. Without the strength of the collective, we cannot read the reference materials that we had never read before in a very short time; without the guidance and support of the broad masses of workers and people engaged in actual productive labor in all aspects, we would not know how to correctly implement the Party's policy. Many people have a relatively close and profound understanding of these things. What is easily overlooked is the role of teachers. Some people think this way: Some teachers are the opponents of our debate, and they not only do not have a positive role in our compilation of outlines, but on the contrary are an obstacle. Is this right or wrong? It is both right and wrong. It is right because young students accept the instructions of the Party faster, while some teachers are more deeply influenced by the old and accept them more slowly. Their old views and conservative ideas are indeed a negative factor and an obstacle. It is wrong because many of the knowledge materials we need in our work are learned directly or indirectly from teachers. Of course, teachers may also have given us some wrong and reactionary views. Without useful knowledge materials, we certainly cannot compile teaching outlines, and without opposing viewpoints, we cannot compile teaching outlines with strong ideology.

Usually, when we say that people today surpass the ancients, we do not mean that every person today surpasses every person in ancient times. Today's medicine is much better than that of the Ming Dynasty, but not every doctor is better than Li Shizhen; today's drama is also much better than that of the Yuan Dynasty, but not every writer is better than Guan Hanqing. Therefore, people today still have to learn from the ancients. Similarly, saying that students surpass teachers does not mean that every student surpasses every teacher in all aspects. From the perspective of the entire historical development process and the trend of development, that is, from a general perspective, people today always surpass their predecessors, and students always surpass their teachers. Moreover, from the perspective of specific facts in daily life, that is, from an individual perspective, teachers often lag behind students, and students often surpass teachers, especially in the Great Leap Forward, there are many such examples. Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty said: "Disciples do not necessarily fall short of teachers, and teachers do not necessarily excel disciples." However, the most common and largest number of phenomena are still that students are not as good as teachers, and that students must learn from teachers. Wang Xizhi was a famous calligrapher of the Jin Dynasty, but he learned calligraphy from Lady Wei; Mei Lanfang is a famous contemporary artist, but he learned opera from Wang Yaoqing. By extension, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, every profession produces experts, but every expert is not born. The ironworker learns to hold pliers for the first time, the farmer learns to hold a hoe for the first time, the soldier learns to handle a gun for the first time, the mathematician learns the first mathematical formula, and the salesperson learns to hold the scale for the first time, all learned from teachers. This is called "People are not born with knowledge, who can be without learning," and to learn, there must be a teacher. The ancients said, "Even with the skill of Gongshuzi, one cannot make a square or circle without a compass and square; even with the hearing of Shi Kuang, one cannot correct the five tones without the six laws." Compasses and squares are the summary of the experience accumulated by previous craftsmen in labor practice, and the six laws are the summary of the experience accumulated by previous musicians in musical practice. The next generation must learn it, usually through the teaching of teachers. Without teachers, the next generation cannot inherit the cultural heritage of the predecessors; without teachers, people would not know how many detours to take in the process from ignorance to knowledge, and from knowing little to knowing more. To be able to become Gongshuzi, one must learn "compasses and squares", to be able to become Shi Kuang, one must learn "the six laws", to surpass Lady Wei, one must first learn from Lady Wei, to surpass Wang Yaoqing, one must first learn from Wang Yaoqing. Without "coming from", there is no "excelling"; without inheritance, there is no development; without learning, there is no talk of surpassing. Denying this is denying the necessity of inheriting human culture, denying the necessity of education, and denying the objective dialectics of the development of things. Therefore, the problem must be viewed from two aspects: on the one hand, Indigo Blue can excel Blue, people today can surpass the ancients, and students can surpass teachers. Understanding this means not being superstitious about the ancients or superstitious about teachers. On the other hand, if Indigo Blue does not "come from" Blue, it cannot "excel Blue", if people today do not inherit from the ancients, they cannot develop the ancients, and if students do not learn from teachers, they cannot surpass their teachers. Understanding this means learning from teachers sincerely, respectfully, and diligently.

Of course, learning must be creative and critical. Learning "compasses and squares" without being bound by outdated compasses and squares, learning "the six laws" without being constrained by the old "six laws", this is criticism, this is creativity. Wang Xizhi creatively learned calligraphy from Lady Wei and surpassed Lady Wei, and Mei Lanfang creatively learned opera from Wang Yaoqing and surpassed Wang Yaoqing. This is called "Indigo Blue Comes From Blue, Yet Excels Blue." So it is said: without inheritance, there is certainly no talk of development; but without development, it is not considered true inheritance. Without learning from teachers, there is certainly no talk of surpassing teachers; but if you dare not surpass teachers, you have not truly learned from teachers. Therefore, the problem here is also two-sided, that is: on the one hand, we must learn humbly and conscientiously; on the other hand, we must learn creatively and critically.

Should we learn from teachers with reactionary bourgeois views? It is not a question of whether or not to learn, but a question of how to learn. Chairman Mao told us: The important thing is to be good at learning, to be good at learning from all kinds of people. For the rightists among the teachers, we should resolutely fight; they are also our teachers, but they are negative teachers and are not included here. Some teachers, on the one hand, their views are bourgeois, and on the other hand, some of the knowledge materials they have are useful to us. If you don't see the former, you will be greatly deceived; if you don't see the latter, you will also suffer losses. The so-called being good at learning means being good at distinguishing these two aspects and adopting different attitudes. Marx learned Hegel's dialectics and discarded his idealism, learned Feuerbach's materialism and discarded his metaphysics, and created dialectical materialism, implementing a revolution in philosophy. Fully utilizing the useful knowledge materials of the bourgeoisie, and analyzing them from the perspective of the proletariat to draw conclusions that can serve the proletariat, in a certain sense, this is also called "Indigo Blue Comes From Blue, Yet Excels Blue."

    青出于蓝而胜于蓝
    季啸风
    学生学习老师，又超过老师；学生尊重老师，又批评老师；师生平等，老师又领导学生；师生争鸣，教学相长，团结互助，共同为发展科学和文化而努力，这是学校里整风运动和教学改革运动中出现的一种崭新的气象。这种气象，标志着以民主团结为基础的新型的社会主义的师生关系已初步建立。它对我国文化教育事业的发展，将产生深远的影响。
    对这种新型的师生关系，特别是学生可以批评老师，有些人一下子还不那么习惯，还不那么心情舒畅。他们总觉得：这能算尊师重道吗？今后还怎样去教育学生呢？几千年来，师生是处在不平等的地位的。老师训斥学生被认为是天经地义，学生批评老师则被认为是悖礼犯义。这种传统的习惯势力的束缚，使人们一下子还不易摆脱，也是可以理解的。
    学生要向老师学习，要接受老师的指导，这是天经地义的；过去如此，今天如此，今后一万年还将如此。学生和老师在真理面前一律平等，学生可以批评老师，这在旧社会是被认为是不合理的，不正常的，而在社会主义制度下则是被认为是合理的，正常的，因而也是天经地义的；今天如此，今后一万年也将如此。
    其实，学生学习老师，又超过老师，自古已然，是谓“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。这是一个客观真理。重要的问题在于：对“出于蓝”和“胜于蓝”，对“学习老师”和“超过老师”之间的关系，要有正确的认识。
    迷信古人的人，总是不相信今人会胜过古人；迷信老师的人，总是不相信学生能超过老师。按照这些人的“逻辑”，人只能一代不如一代，社会只能“今不如昔”。这种人可以叫做“九斤老太”。去年，毛主席号召我们要破除迷信，解放思想，开了我们的心窍。敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，一经和科学分析的精神相结合，便到处出现奇迹，使我们确信今人可以超过古人，确信学生可以胜过老师，从而又促进了思想的进一步解放。
    今天，我们的思想是否已经解放得很彻底了呢？当然还不能这么说。有些人不是说吗：在某些技术上学生可以超过老师，而在理论上学生就无法超过老师；因此，破除迷信，解放思想的任务，并没有完成。
    但是，问题也还有值得注意的另一个方面。这就是不能只看到“青胜于蓝”和“超过老师”，而不重视“青出于蓝”和“学习老师”。
    学生超过老师，今人胜过古人，并不是轻而易举的。拿教学改革中学生编的教学大纲为例，有一些的确大大胜过了老师，但这中间有党的领导，有群众的力量，也有老师的作用。没有党的领导，我们就不能破除迷信，解放思想，就不能“敢想敢说敢干”；没有党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针，我们编大纲就不能有正确的方向。没有集体的力量，我们就无法在很短的时间内读完原来根本没有读过的参考资料；没有广大工人群众和各方面从事实际生产劳动的人指导和支持，我们就不知道怎样做才算正确贯彻了党的方针。对于这些，许多人体会得是比较亲切、比较深刻的。容易忽视的是老师的作用。有人这样想：有些老师是我们争论的对方，他们对我们编写大纲不仅没有积极作用，相反是一种阻碍力量。对不对呢？又对，又不对。说他对，是因为青年同学接受党的指示较快，而有些教师在这方面则由于受旧的影响较深，接受起来就比较迟缓。他们的旧观点、保守思想，的确是一种消极因素，是一种阻碍力量。说他不对，是因为在我们的工作中所需要的许多知识材料，许多是直接或间接从老师那里学来的。当然，老师也可能给了我们一些错误的、反动的观点。没有有用的知识材料，固然编不出教学大纲，没有反面的观点，我们也不能编出思想性很强的教学大纲。
    通常我们说今人胜过古人，并不是说今天的每一个人都胜过了古代的每一个人。今天的医学胜过明代多了，但并不是每一个医生都胜过李时珍；今天的戏剧也胜过元代多了，但并不是每一个作家都胜过了关汉卿。因此，今人还得向古人学习。同样，说学生超过先生，并不是说每一个学生在各方面都超过了每一个老师。从整个历史发展的进程、发展的趋向看，即从总的方面看，今人总是胜过前人，学生总是超过先生的。并且，从日常生活中的具体事实看，即从个别方面看，老师往往落后于学生，学生往往超过了老师，特别是在大跃进中这样的事例尤多。唐代韩愈就说过：“弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子”。但是，最常见最大量的现象，还是学生不如老师，还是学生要向老师学习。王羲之是晋代的名书法家，然而他曾学字于卫夫人；梅兰芳是当代的名艺术家，然而他曾学戏于王瑶卿。推而广之，工农兵学商，行行出能手，但是每一个能手都不是天生的。铁工第一次学会拿钳子，农民第一次学会握锄头，战士第一次学会操枪，数学家学会第一个数学公式，营业员第一次学会掌秤，都是从老师那里学来的。这叫做“人非生而知之，孰能无学”，要学就得有老师。古人说过“公输子之巧，不以规矩不能成方圆；师旷之聪，不以六律不能正五音”。规矩是前辈工匠在劳动实践中积累的经验的总结，六律是前辈乐师在音乐实践中积累的经验的总结，后一代人要学习它，通常是经过老师传授的。没有老师，后人就不能继承前人的文化遗产；没有老师，人们在从无知到有知，从知之不多到知之较多的过程中，就不知要走多少冤枉路。要能成为公输子，就得学“规矩”，要能成为师旷，就得学习“六律”，要超过卫夫人，就先要学习卫夫人，要超过王瑶卿，就先要学习王瑶卿。没有“出于”，就没有“胜于”；没有继承，就没有发展；没有学习，就谈不上超过。否认这一点，就是否认继承人类文化的必要，否认教育的必要，否认事物发展的客观辩证法。因此，问题要从两方面看：一方面是青可以胜于蓝，今人可以超过古人，学生可以胜过老师。懂得这一点，就是不要迷信古人，迷信老师。另一方面是青不“出于”蓝，就不能“胜于蓝”，今人不继承古人，就不能发展古人，学生不学习老师，就不能超过先生。懂得这一点，就是要诚诚恳恳地学习老师，恭恭敬敬地学习老师，兢兢业业地学习老师。
    当然，学习必须是创造性地学，批判地学。学习“规矩”，而又不受过了时的规矩的束缚，学习“六律”，又不受旧的“六律”的羁绊，这就是批判，这就是创造性。王羲之创造性地学字于卫夫人而超过卫夫人，梅兰芳创造性地学戏于王瑶卿而超过王瑶卿。这叫做“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。所以说：没有继承，固然谈不上发展；但是没有发展，也还不算真正的继承。不学习老师，固然谈不上超过老师；但是不敢超过老师，也还不算真正学习了老师。因此，这里的问题也是两方面，即：一方面是要虚心地学，认真地学；另一方面又要创造性地学，批判地学。
    对于那些具有反动的资产阶级观点的老师，要不要学习呢？不是要不要学习的问题，而是如何学的问题。毛主席告诉我们：重要的问题是善于学习，要善于向各种人学习。对于教师中的右派分子，应该坚决斗争；他们也是我们的教员，但是他们是反面教员，不在此列。有些教师，一方面他们的观点是资产阶级的，另一方面他们所掌握的某些知识材料对我们却是有用的。看不到前一方面，要上大当；看不到后一方面，也要受损失。所谓善于学习，就是要善于区别这两个方面而采取不同的态度。马克思学习了黑格尔的辩证法而摈弃了他的唯心主义，学习了费尔巴哈的唯物论而摈弃了他的形而上学，创造了辩证唯物主义，实行了哲学上的革命。充分运用资产阶级有用的知识材料，而以无产阶级的观点予以解剖得出可以服务于无产阶级的结论，在一定意义上说，这也叫“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。
