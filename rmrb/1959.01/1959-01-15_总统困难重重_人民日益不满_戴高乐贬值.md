    President Faces Numerous Difficulties, People Increasingly Dissatisfied
    De Gaulle Devalued
    (Our Combined Reports) De Gaulle formally took office as president on January 8th and subsequently appointed Debré, one of the leaders of the "Union for the New Republic," to form a cabinet. However, the situation of this president of the "Fifth Republic of France" has actually become far different from what it was a few months ago during the coup and "referendum." His "prestige" in the eyes of the French people has greatly declined. The Associated Press reported in a news item that "the period when the whole country showed goodwill towards him (De Gaulle) is obviously over." Observers in Paris even believe that, seven months after taking office, De Gaulle's credibility has depreciated even more than the franc.
    These comments from Western news agencies are not without foundation.
    Attacking the People Meets Resistance
    In order to cope with the West European trade war, the De Gaulle government devalued the franc. To make up for the budget deficit caused by the continued colonial war in Algeria, it announced a large number of so-called "savings" measures on the eve of the New Year, forcing the French people to tighten their belts. These measures stipulate the abolition of subsidies for coal and food, and the increase of postage, telephone charges, train tickets, electricity fees, gas fees, etc. Income tax, corporate tax, wine tax, and tobacco tax will also be increased, which will make small taxpayers bear 309 billion francs of new taxes. Not only that, the De Gaulle government also wants to tighten and reduce insurance premiums, cancel veterans' pensions, and freeze wages. This policy of the De Gaulle government, which launched a rampant attack on the living standards of the French working people, immediately caused prices to soar. Bread rose by 3 francs per kilogram, postage for ordinary letters and local telephone charges also rose by 5 francs, cigarettes rose by 15 francs, coal prices rose by 11%, electricity prices rose by an average of 12%, gas prices rose by 4.5% to 7%, and wine prices will also rise by 10 to 15 francs. In addition, rice, chocolate, egg noodles, jam, and imported goods... will all have to rise in price. In the Paris market, the prices of fifteen kinds of food, including beef, mutton, cream, fruits, and vegetables, have also risen again.
    The financial and economic policies adopted by De Gaulle have already aroused strong dissatisfaction among the French people. On the eve of De Gaulle's inauguration as president, more than 2,000 employees of the Paris Gas and Electricity Company held a demonstration, demanding a 20% increase in wages. At the same time, railway workers are also preparing to hold a "warning" strike demanding an 11% increase in wages. The powerful National Federation of Farmers stated that if the government does not restore food subsidies, they will stop delivering meat, milk, and other foods. The French National Veterans Association, which has 2.5 million members and has always supported De Gaulle, held a demonstration on the 11th to protest the government's cancellation of veterans' pensions. The Catholic Labor League also vehemently criticized the French government's financial and economic measures, protesting against rising prices. The French Communist Party issued an appeal to the French people on the 11th, calling on them to stop the policies that are leading the people to ruin and poverty.
    Not only in France, but also in the overseas member states of the "French Community," a wave of protests has been set off. In Niamey, Niger, in French West Africa, workers recently held a 24-hour general strike to protest the French colonial authorities' cancellation of work injury insurance and occupational disease insurance. In Dakar, the capital of Senegal, workers are also brewing a similar general strike.
    Moreover, De Gaulle's situation is not smooth in terms of colonial issues and foreign policy.
    Colonial Policy Causes Disagreements
    The Algerian issue has once again brought the contradictions within the French ruling class to the surface. In his speech upon taking office as president, De Gaulle reiterated his proposals made at the end of October last year regarding "developing Algeria's personality" and "maintaining its close ties with mainland France." In addition, according to official announcements, the government decided to release more than 7,000 political prisoners imprisoned in various concentration camps within Algeria and is preparing to exile five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, who were illegally arrested in 1956, to a small island. De Gaulle's actions have already aroused criticism from those extreme colonialists within Algeria who advocate openly annexing Algeria.
    According to an analysis in "l'Humanité," this division reflects the contradiction between the interests of the French big bourgeoisie and financial oligarchs and the extreme colonialists within Algeria. Obviously, the large monopoly groups agree to grant the colonies a certain degree of so-called autonomy so that they can more easily plunder the oil resources of the Sahara. It is estimated that De Gaulle may put pressure on the extreme colonialists in the future, forcing them to accept this approach of implementing colonial rule with appeasement. This is bound to arouse resistance from the extreme right-wing elements who basically represent the interests of the colonists engaged in agricultural exploitation in North Africa.
    Foreign Policy Requires Careful Planning
    In terms of foreign policy, De Gaulle once wrote a check promising to "implement independent diplomacy" to enhance France's international status. He has been aggressive towards the United States and Britain, demanding to share the leadership of the Western world. He had a fierce conflict with Britain over the "Common Market" and "Free Trade Area" issues, opening the prelude to a life-and-death economic war between imperialist countries. But to confront the United States and Britain, De Gaulle had to rely on uniting West Germany, which gave West Germany an opportunity to compete for the hegemony of Western Europe. Therefore, how to use the power of West Germany to oppose the United States and Britain while not being constrained by West Germany is a difficult problem for De Gaulle in foreign policy.

### 总统困难重重　人民日益不满  戴高乐贬值

    总统困难重重　人民日益不满
    戴高乐贬值
    本报综合报道　戴高乐于1月8日正式就任了总统，并且跟着任命了“保卫新共和联盟”的领袖之一德勃雷组成了内阁。但是，这位“法兰西第五共和国”的总统的景况，实际上已经变得远非几个月前搞政变和“公民投票”时可比，他在法国人民的眼中，“声望”已大为降落。合众国际社在一则消息中报道说：“显然全国对他（戴高乐）表示好感的时期是结束了”。巴黎的观察家们甚至认为，在上台七个月以后，戴高乐的威信甚至比法郎还要贬值得厉害。
    西方通讯社的这种评论，不是没有根据的。
    进攻人民遭到反击
    戴高乐政府为了应付西欧贸易战而实施的法郎贬值，为了弥补继续阿尔及利亚殖民战争造成的预算赤字，在新年前夕公布了一大批强令法国人民勒紧裤带的所谓“节约”措施。这些措施规定取消对煤和食品的补贴，提高邮资、电话费、火车票、电气费、煤气费等等价格；还要增收所得税、公司税、酒税、烟税，这些将使得小纳税者要担负着三千零九十亿法郎的新捐税。这些不算，戴高乐政府还要紧缩和削减保险金，取消退伍军人的年金，冻结工资。戴高乐政府这种向法国劳动人民生活水平发动了猖狂进攻的政策立即引起了物价飞涨。面包每公斤上涨了三法郎、平信邮资和市内电话费也上涨了五法郎、卷烟上涨十五法郎、煤的价格上涨11％、电费平均上涨了12％、煤气费上涨4.5％到7％、酒价也将上涨十至十五法郎；此外，大米、巧克力、鸡蛋面、果酱、以及进口货……都得涨价。巴黎市场上，牛羊肉、奶油、水果和蔬菜等共十五种食品也再度涨价。
    戴高乐所采取的财政经济政策，在法国人民中已经引起了强烈的不满。在戴高乐就职总统的前夕，巴黎市煤气和电力公司的两千多名职工举行了示威游行，要求增加工资20％；同时铁路工人也准备举行“警告性”的罢工要求增加工资11％；而有势力的全国农民联合会则表示，如果政府不恢复食物补贴，他们将停止送肉类、牛奶和其他食品。拥有二百五十万会员和一向支持戴高乐的法国全国退伍军人协会11日举行了示威，反对政府取消退伍军人年金。天主教劳工联盟也猛烈抨击法国政府的财政经济措施，抗议物价上涨。法国共产党11日向法国人民发出呼吁，号召他们制止引导人民走向毁灭和贫困的政策。
    不仅仅在法国国内，而且在“法兰西共同体”中的海外成员国也掀起了抗议浪潮。在法属西非的尼日尔的尼亚美，工人们最近举行了一次二十四小时总罢工，抗议法国殖民当局取消工伤事故保险和职业病保险的做法。在塞尔加尔首府达喀尔，工人们也在酝酿类似的总罢工。
    不仅如此，戴高乐在殖民地问题和外交政策方面处境也不顺利。
    殖民政策引起分歧
    阿尔及利亚问题已经使法国统治阶级内部的矛盾再度趋于表面化。戴高乐在就职总统时的讲话里重新提出了他在去年10月底说过的有关“发展阿尔及利亚的个性”和
  “保持它与法国本土的密切联系”等主张。另外据官方宣布，政府决定释放囚禁在阿尔及利亚境内各集中营里的七千多名政治犯，并且准备把在1956年时非法逮捕的五名阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领袖流放到一个小岛上去。戴高乐的这些作法已经引起那些在阿尔及利亚境内的、主张公开吞并阿尔及利亚的极端殖民主义者的非难。
    据“人道报”分析，这种分歧正反映了法国大资产阶级和金融寡头们同阿尔及利亚境内的极端殖民主义者之间的利益的矛盾。显然大垄断集团同意给予殖民地以一定的所谓自治，以便自己能更顺利地掠夺撒哈拉的石油富源。人们估计，戴高乐今后可能会对极端殖民主义者施压力，迫使他们接受这种用怀柔手腕来实行殖民统治的作法。这势必会引起那些基本上代表在北非从事农业剥削的殖民者利益的极右分子的反抗。
    外交政策煞费筹措
    戴高乐在外交政策方面曾经开出支票要“执行独立外交”以提高法国的国际地位。他向美英开过火，要求分享西方世界的领导权。他在“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”问题上同英国发生了激烈冲突，揭开了帝国主义国家之间一场你死我活的经济混战的序幕。但是要对抗美英，戴高乐就不得不依靠联合西德，这就给了西德一个争夺西欧霸主的机会。因此，如何借用西德的力量来反对美英，同时又不受西德的牵制，这是戴高乐在外交政策上的一个难题。（附图片）
