    Rapid Fertilizer Production Even in Severe Cold Weather
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Zhongjia Management District of the Baima People's Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, is vigorously engaged in a winter high-speed, high-efficiency fertilizer production campaign.
    How to carry out high-speed, high-efficiency fertilizer accumulation and production in the severe cold season? The management district has found the following good methods: (1) Using fire to accelerate the fermentation of human waste. Use 20% human waste, mix with 80% water and poultry manure, stir and place in jars, cover the jars and place them in a deep ditch with a shed. Light a fire at one end, and it will be fully fermented into fast-acting fertilizer in three to five days. (2) Deep pit high-temperature fertilizer production method. Dig large, deep pits, fill them with manure and soil, and stir in layers with water. Then, make several small holes, pour in human waste soup as yeast, and seal with soil. In this way, the pit not only does not freeze, but also gets hotter as it ferments. A pit is fermented in about forty days. (3) High-temperature composting method. Mix manure, soil, and water together and seal them into large manure piles, with a thick layer of soil added to the surface to keep the inside fermenting. Using these two methods, they have accumulated seven million catties of fertilizer, and each of the 3,900 mu of wheat has been universally top-dressed with 10,000 catties per mu. A second top-dressing of 20,000 catties per mu was applied to more than 800 mu. (4) Regularly turn over the pigsty pits to keep the pigsty from freezing and to ensure that water and soil are not lacking, so that they can be accumulated and fermented as usual. Now all the manure pits are under the charge of specific people, who stir them several times a day with iron forks or wooden forks to prevent the water from freezing. (5) Diligently add soil and frequently clean out the pens to accumulate more livestock manure.

    严寒天气也能快速造肥
    本报讯　山东蓬莱县白马公社仲家管理区，大搞冬季高速效造肥运动。
    怎样在严寒的季节进行高速效积肥造肥，这个管理区找到了以下几种好办法：（1）生火加快人粪尿发酵。用20％的人粪尿，兑上80％的水和家禽粪，搅拌盛入缸内，把缸盖好放进有棚的深沟内，在一端升起烟火，三、五天即全部发酵，变为速效肥。（2）深坑高温造肥法。挖大深坑，把粪土填到坑里，加水层层搅拌。然后打成若干个小洞眼，灌上人粪汤作酵母，用土封闭起来，这样坑内不仅不冻，而且越沤越热，四十天左右沤好一坑。（3）高温堆积法。把粪、土、水搅拌一起封成大粪堆，表皮上厚厚的加上一层土，内面发酵。它们运用这两种办法，已积肥七百万斤，三千九百亩小麦每亩普遍追了一万斤。第二遍每亩两万斤，又追了八百多亩。（4）定时翻搅猪圈坑，使猪圈不冻，水、土不缺，照常积沤。现在所有的粪坑，都有专人负责，每天用铁杈或木杈搅拌几次，做到水不结冰。（5）勤垫土勤出圈，大积牲口圈肥。
