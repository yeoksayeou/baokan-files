West Germany's "prosperity" under the distorted development of its post-war economy has vanished. West Germany's economy is already facing a crisis. This is not only due to the impact of the American economic crisis, but also because the internal factors of the West German economic crisis are maturing.

Crisis Looms, Inescapable

The signs of the West German economic crisis are first manifested in the sharp decline in the growth rate of basic industrial investment. The period from 1950 to 1955 was the period of the fastest growth in West German investment. 1955 reached its peak, increasing by 23.5% compared with the previous year. But after that, things slowly went wrong. Despite several reductions in the bank discount rate by the West German government (from 5.5% to 3%) to encourage private investment, the situation has improved little. Investment in 1957 increased by only 4.31% compared to 1956.

1949-1957 Investment Situation: Total Equipment Investment Unit: 100 Million Marks
	Growth % (Compared to Previous Year)
1949	157.00
1950	184.55	17.6%
1951	222.60	20.6%
1952	254.70	14.4%
1953	286.65	12.5%
1954	322.05	12.3%
1955	397.70	23.5%
1956	441.00	10.9%
1957	460.00	4.31%

In the first quarter of 1958, West German fixed capital investment increased by only 3.4% compared to the same period in 1957. It can be seen from the above materials that the investment boom in West German industry has passed, and the renewal and expansion of fixed capital is also nearing completion. This powerful factor stimulating industrial development is gradually disappearing.

Second, the signs of the West German economic crisis are manifested as a commercial crisis. Starting in the spring of 1958, the West German coal mining industry experienced a sales crisis, which continues to worsen. As of early November, the total amount of unsold coal in the Ruhr area reached a peak of 12 million tons, which is 3.5 million tons more than the peak of West German coal production during the capitalist economic crisis of 1929-1933; the supply of West German coal has exceeded the demand by 64 million tons, equivalent to half a year's coal demand in the Ruhr area. The coal inventory of various coal-consuming industrial sectors, such as the steel industry, power industry, and gas companies, has increased sharply. According to the most conservative estimate of the West German coal industry, the total amount of unsold coal will exceed the 14 million ton mark before New Year's Day in 1959. The situation of unsold steel products is also very serious. As early as the end of August last year, steel inventory had already exceeded the normal inventory by one time. At present, the inventory of unsold textiles is equivalent to three months of total output of the entire textile industry. In terms of foreign trade, due to the decline in demand in foreign markets, the growth rate of West Germany's imports and exports has gradually decreased, and in some months, the decline in imports and exports has been quite large. For example, compared with the same month of the previous year in March 1958, exports decreased by 4.7% (this is the first phenomenon since 1950), exports decreased by 6% in May, and imports decreased by 10%. Exports decreased by 4.7% in August, and imports decreased by 7.8%. In the first half of 1958, West Germany barely increased its exports by 1% after expending great effort. This shows that the export prosperity of West Germany has passed.

Third, the commercial crisis inevitably affects the normal operation of production. Due to product backlogs, reduced orders, factory closures, and increased unemployment. For example, the "off-shift" phenomenon in the coal mining industry is very serious. Ninety-six of the 120 operating mines across the country frequently experience "off-shifts." As of the end of September 1958, the number of "off-shifts" had reached 1.3 million times. Capitalists in the coal mining industry have proposed the idea of "determining production by sales" in the future; for this reason, one-third of the existing mines will be forced to close, resulting in 150,000 miners becoming unemployed. In the West German steel industry, only 133 of the 215 Martin furnaces across the country are in operation. At present, the equipment utilization rate of the vast majority of steel companies can only reach about 80%, and some only reach 60%. In mid-October last year, 5,000 steel workers were laid off. In the construction industry, it is estimated that the equipment utilization rate this year can only reach 60%. In the first half of last year, the textile industry received 21% fewer new orders than in the same period of the previous year. Since January this year, the operating hours of textile factories have been shortened by an average of 14%. Fifty-five of the 71 glove weaving factories have been forced to close, and three more textile companies went bankrupt in early October last year. Since 1958, the shipbuilding industry has laid off 20,000 workers due to a continuous decline in orders. In mid-October last year, the railway industry announced the layoff of 7,000 employees. In April last year, the number of unemployed workers once increased to more than 1.4 million, an increase of 36.6% compared with the same period of the previous year.

Fourth, the signs of the economic crisis in West Germany are manifested in the decline in production in major industrial sectors such as coal, steel, and machinery manufacturing. Compared with the previous year, steel industry production decreased by 7% in 1958; machine tool production decreased by about 10% from January to July last year compared with the same period of the previous year. The production reduction in the consumer industry sector is even more widespread. Taking only the textile industry as an example, since January last year, the production decline rate has increased from 15% in January to 10% in September. From the perspective of overall industrial production, the industrial production growth rate has been declining year by year since 1956, and by the summer of 1958, the decline in the production growth rate has developed into a decline in production: industrial production in May decreased by 0.4% compared with the same period of the previous year. This is the first such phenomenon in the ten years since the war.

All these indicate that the West German economy has begun to enter an economic crisis.

The Trend is Gone, Ominous Signs Abound

The internal factors of the West German economic crisis are gradually maturing. The development of the crisis has the following characteristics:

First, the development of the West German economic crisis is relatively slow. This is somewhat different from the characteristics of the American economic crisis. This is because the consequences of World War II exacerbated the imbalance in the development of the capitalist world economy. First of all, during the war and after the war, West Germany's industrial production capacity suffered very little loss (at most only 10%), which enabled West German capitalists to use the production capacity that was not fully utilized during the war, plus American aid (such as the Marshall Plan), to quickly restore industrial production to the pre-war level. Secondly, in order to pursue the highest profits, West German monopoly capitalists also built a large number of equipment that met the latest technical conditions, and the original equipment was also modernized, so that production developed rapidly. Due to cruel exploitation, product costs were low, so in the very sharp competition in the capitalist world market, West Germany could still gain the upper hand, and foreign economic expansion achieved rapid development. The expansion of exports in turn stimulated the continuous increase and expansion of investment. The expansion of industrial investment and foreign trade expansion relatively delayed the West German economic crisis.

Second, the West German economic crisis is still localized at this stage and has not spread to all industrial sectors and agriculture. The crisis development in various industrial sectors is also uneven. It can be clearly seen from the above materials that the most severe crisis is in the coal mining industry, steel industry, and textile industry, followed by other industrial sectors. But the situation in the automobile industry, chemical industry, and electrical departments is the opposite. In the automobile industry, the production growth rate in 1957 was only 5.7%; compared with the same period in 1957, the growth rate in January 1958 was 16.5%, 17% in February, and 10.4% in May. The development of the automobile industry is mainly due to the increased demand in foreign markets. About 50% of the products are exported, mainly to the United States, while the production of the American automobile industry has greatly declined. Due to the great dependence on exports, the development of the West German automobile industry is very unreliable. It can be seen that the production increase in some industrial sectors is based on a very unstable foundation. With the further expansion and deepening of the capitalist world economic crisis, the further shrinking of domestic and foreign markets, the internal factors of the West German economic crisis will gradually mature, and the possibility of expanding from some major industrial sectors to a comprehensive crisis exists and is developing.

Arms Production, Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst

Faced with the increasingly developing economic crisis, West German capitalists show anxiety and unease about the prospects for industrial development. However, in order to stabilize people's hearts, on the one hand, the newspapers and periodicals of the West German ruling group and Federal Economic Minister Erhard asserted that West Germany would not experience a "recession" to deceive the people. But at the same time, for the highest profits of monopoly capital, they have to take so-called "anti-crisis measures." These measures are:

First, step up the arms race and arms production competition. A year ago, West German monopoly capital had not engaged in a large amount of arms production, which was beneficial to them politically or economically. However, with the advent of the crisis, West German monopoly capital became more interested in arms production. They demanded to minimize foreign military orders and manufacture domestically. It has recently been announced that the order for aircraft placed with the UK and France in February and March 1958 will be cancelled, and it has been decided to imitate the American F-104 aircraft to equip the Air Force. According to the decision of the Bonn-Paris-Rome arms triangle, the huge Krupp company will produce nuclear submarines. In August, West German Defense Minister Strauss promised to allocate 1 billion marks to support rocket weapons research. West Germany's military budget for 1958-59 is 10.7 billion marks. In addition, the Ministry of Defense can also use 6 billion marks - the surplus of expenditures over the years, a total of 16.7 billion marks, accounting for 7.9% of the total social product in 1957 (210.1 billion). The armaments expenditure for this year almost accounts for 47% of the total armaments expenditure of 36 billion marks (equivalent to 6.188 billion US dollars) spent by West Germany in participating in the North Atlantic Group in the past four years. Arms production may have some impact on the West German economy, but it can never change the overall development trend. According to the "Frankfurt Forum", tax revenue in the 1958-59 fiscal year budget continues to be delayed and will be reduced by 90 million marks compared with the planned revenue, and the deficit will reach 1.7 billion marks, which is the first deficit budget in recent years. The next budget year may be even more difficult. In addition to further delays in tax revenue, West Germany's military budget will also increase to 11 billion marks. To provide funds for arming the Federal Defense Forces, West Germany is also preparing to establish a currency reserve of nearly 5 billion marks. For this purpose, additional taxes will be increased by increasing income tax and turnover tax by 10%, while reducing social welfare, culture, science and other non-military purposes expenditures, and adopting various inflation methods. The result of the implementation of these measures is to reduce the living standards of the working people, thereby making the contradiction between production and consumption more acute and promoting the further development of the crisis.

Desperate Expansion, A Fight to the Death

Second, strengthen foreign economic expansion and dumping policies.

First of all, in order to resolve the coal sales crisis, the West German government has agreed to cancel the contract to import 6 million tons of coal from the United States and reduce the amount of coal imported from the United States. At the same time, it has tried its best to lower coal prices and implement dumping to Western European countries. This practice of the West German government has aroused great dissatisfaction among American monopoly capital and deepened the contradiction between the United States and West Germany.

Secondly, West Germany is formulating a broad plan for West German capital to expand in the capitalist world market, and is striving to reach the same level as the United States and the United Kingdom, major capital exporting countries, in this regard. Its main export targets are the so-called "underdeveloped countries" in South America, Africa, and Asia. According to West German capitalists' statistics, these countries have a total population of 1.5 billion. This is the so-called "Erhard Plan." This plan will eventually expand to about 60 non-European countries that are undergoing economic construction. It is revealed that the "Asian Erhard Plan," which is part of this plan, stipulates the establishment of a 1 billion mark fund to encourage West German private capital to invest in Asian countries, guaranteeing them against "political risks" such as nationalization and other interventions. Erhard's tour of eight Asian countries including India and Burma in October-November last year was precisely to create conditions for the implementation of this plan. West Germany is stepping up its expansion to the countries of the Middle East and Near East. Although the trade volume between West Germany and these countries does not account for a large proportion of its total imports and exports, it is developing rapidly. For example, in the first half of last year, exports to this region increased by 29% and imports increased by 22% compared with the same period of the previous year. In Latin America, West Germany's influence is also gradually expanding. In Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, Peru, Argentina, and Uruguay, West Germany's competition with the United States is intensifying. Favorable trade conditions, especially credit conditions, have increased the demand for West German goods in these countries. West German capital has even infiltrated Canada, which makes the United States feel very uneasy. West Germany's widespread economic expansion has first hit the interests of the United Kingdom, and has also intensified the contradictions with several major imperialist countries.

In Western Europe, with the expansion and deepening of the economic crisis, the competition among major capitalist countries for sales markets and raw material supply markets has become more acute. This contradiction and struggle is most clearly manifested in the quarrel over the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area." Continental Western Europe is one of West Germany's major markets. West Germany's exports to Western European countries account for about 60% of its total exports (reaching £1.768 billion in 1957). However, due to the economic instability in Western European capitalist countries to varying degrees, this cannot but affect West Germany's position in the Western European market. Taking the first nine months of 1958 as an example, West Germany's exports to "Common Market" countries decreased by 6% compared with the same period of the previous year. Therefore, how to ensure that West Germany continues to expand in the Western European market has become an urgent issue for West German monopoly capital. On the one hand, the West German monopoly capital group attempts to control the economies of the countries of Continental Western Europe and become the leader of the "Common Market," and at the same time, it attempts to gain leadership within the brewing "Free Trade Area." For this reason, West Germany must squeeze out its main competitor, the United Kingdom, and drive British forces out of Continental Europe. And the Western European market is also important to the United Kingdom. In 1957, the United Kingdom's exports to Western European countries reached £938 million (accounting for about one-quarter of its total exports). The United Kingdom is unwilling to lose this traditional market in Western Europe and attempts to strengthen the United Kingdom's position in the Western European market and compete for the leadership of the Continental European economy with the help of the "Free Trade Area" plan. Obviously, this is a sharp conflict of fundamental interests between the United Kingdom and West Germany. The sharp Franco-British contradiction currently appearing in Western Europe actually also contains a serious struggle between the United Kingdom and West Germany.

However, serious contradictions also exist between West Germany and France on Continental Europe, especially within the "Common Market." However, the two sides are not evenly matched. In terms of economic strength, West Germany is in a more advantageous position than France. West Germany's exports to Western European countries are twice that of France; France also needs West Germany, borrowing money from West Germany to develop Africa and conduct the Algerian War. Therefore, it is difficult for France to compete with West Germany economically. However, de Gaulle can use certain political conditions to bargain with Adenauer. All these indicate that due to the increasingly serious economic crisis and the widespread expansion of West German monopoly capital, the contradictions among several major imperialist countries, especially the contradictions between West Germany and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, will inevitably become more acute.

In short, the advent of the West German economic crisis is not an "accidental and exceptional phenomenon." It is the inevitable result of the development of the periodic economic crisis in the capitalist world. The contradiction between the blind expansion tendency of production and the limited development of the consumer market and its gradual shrinking trend inevitably leads to a serious economic crisis. The result of the implementation of artificial so-called "anti-crisis measures" will not only fail to "eliminate" the crisis, but will inevitably lead to its opposite, ultimately deepening and expanding the crisis.

    西德面临经济危机
    马金文
    战后西德经济畸形发展下的“繁荣”已经消逝。西德经济已面临危机。这不仅因为美国经济危机的影响，而且西德经济危机的内在因素正在成熟。
    危机临头　在劫难逃
    西德经济危机的征象首先表现在工业基本投资增长率锐减，从1950—1955年是西德投资速度增长最快的时期。1955年达到了最高峰，与前一年相比，增加了23.5％。但是之后就慢慢不妙了。尽管西德政府几次减低银行贴现率（从5.5％降到3％），来鼓励私人投资，但是情况很少有起色。1957年的投资比1956年仅增加了4.31％。1949—1957年投资情况设备投资总额单位：亿马克
  增长％（与前一年相比）1949  157.001950  184.55  17.6％1951  222.60  20.6％1952  254.70  14.4％1953  286.65  12.5％1954  322.05  12.3％1955  397.70  23.5％1956  441.00  10.9％1957  460.00  4.31％
    1958年第一季度，西德固定资本投资仅比1957年同期增加3.4％。从上面的材料可以看出，西德工业的投资高潮已经过去，固定资本的更新和扩大也已接近尾声，作为刺激工业发展的这一有力因素在逐步消逝。
    第二，西德经济危机的征象表现为商业危机。从1958年春季开始，西德采煤业便爆发了销售危机，迄今正在继续恶化。截止11月初，鲁尔区滞销的存煤总量已达到一千二百万吨的高峰，比1929—1933年资本主义经济大危机年代西德煤产滞销量的最高峰还多出三百五十万吨；西德煤的供应已超过需要量的六千四百万吨，相当于鲁尔区半年所需要的煤量，各用煤工业部门，如钢铁工业、电力工业、煤气公司等，煤的库存量剧增。据西德煤业最保守的估计，到1959年元旦以前，滞销的存煤总量将突破一千四百万吨大关。钢铁产品滞销的情况亦很严重。早在去年8月底钢铁库存量已经超过通常库存量的一倍。目前滞销纺织品的库存量已经相当于整个纺织业三个月的总产量。在对外贸易方面，由于国外市场需求量的降低，西德的进出口的增长率逐渐下降，而且在某些月
  份，进出口下降幅度相当大，如1958年3月跟前一年同月相比，出口减少4.7％（这是1950年以来的首次现象），5月出口减少6％，进口减少10％。8月出口减少4.7％，进口减少7.8％。1958年上半年费了九牛二虎之力，西德的出口才勉强增加了1％。这说明西德的出口繁荣已经过去了。
    第三，商业危机必然影响生产的正常进行。由于产品滞销、订货减少，工厂倒闭，失业工人增加。例如采煤业的“歇班”现象已非常严重。全国一百二十个正在开工的矿井中有九十六个矿井经常发生“歇班”，至1958年9月底，“歇班”次数已达一百三十万次之多。采煤业的资本家已提出今后将“以销定产”的主张；为此现有矿井的三分之一将被迫关闭，因而使十五万矿工将告失业。在西德钢铁业中全国二百一十五座马丁炉中，开工的只有一百三十三座；目前绝大多数的钢铁企业的设备利用率只能达到80％左右，有的仅达60％；去年10月中已有五千钢铁工人被裁；在建筑业方面，估计今年设备利用率只能达到60％。去年上半年纺织工业获得的新订货比前年同期减少21％；从今年1月以来，各纺织厂的开工时间平均缩短了14％；七十一家手套织造厂，已经有五十五家被迫歇业，而在去年10月初又有三家纺织企业倒闭。造船业1958年以来因订货不断减少已经解雇两万名工人。铁路业在去年10月中旬宣布裁减职工七千人。去年4月失业工人曾一度增加到一百四十多万人，比前年同期增加36.6％。
    第四，西德的经济危机征象表现在煤业、钢铁业和机器制造业等主要工业部门的生产下降。钢铁工业生产跟前年相比，1958年减产7％；机床的生产在去年1—7月比前年同期减少了10％左右。消费工业部门的减产情况更为普遍，只拿纺织工业为例，从去年1月以来生产下降率已从1月的15％增加到9月的10％。从整个工业生产来看，自1956年开始工业生产增长率逐年下降，到1958年夏季已由生产增长率的下降发展为生产下降：5月份工业生产比前年同期下降0.4％。这是战后十年来的首次现象。
    所有这些说明，西德经济已开始进入经济
  危机。
      大势已去　凶多吉少
    西德经济危机的内在因素正在逐步成熟。危机发展的情况有如下几个特点：
    第一，西德经济危机的发展较为缓慢。这与美国经济危机的特征有所不同，这是由于第二次世界大战的后果加剧了资本主义世界经济发展的不平衡性。首先，在战争时期和战后，西德工业生产能力损失甚少（最多只占10％），这就使西德资本家利用战时未能充分利用的生产能力外加美援（如马歇尔计划）把工业生产迅速地恢复到战前的水平。其次，为了追逐最高利润，西德垄断资本家又大量修建了符合最新技术条件的设备，原有的设备也进行了现代化的改造，使生产发展较快；由于残酷的剥削，产品成本较低，所以在资本主义世界市场非常尖锐的竞争条件下，西德仍然还能占上风，对外经济扩张获得迅速发展。出口的扩张反过来又刺激了投资的不断增加和扩大。工业投资的扩大和对外贸易扩张相对地推迟了西德的经济危机。
    第二，西德经济危机在目前阶段还带有局部性，尚未扩及所有的工业部门和农业，各工业部门危机发展也是不平衡的。从上述材料可明显看出，危机发展最甚者是采煤业、钢铁工业和纺织业，其它工业部门次之。但汽车工业、化学业和电气部门的情况适反。在汽车工业方面1957年生产增长率仅为5.7％；与1957年同期相比，1958年1月的增长率为16.5％，2月为17％，5月为10.4％。汽车业之发展主要是因为国外市场的需求增加了，约有50％的产品供出口，主要是向美国出口，而美国的汽车工业生产则大大下降。由于对出口的依赖性很大，西德汽车工业的发展是很不可靠的。可以看出某些工业部门的生产上升是建立在极不稳固的基础上的。随着资本主义世界经济危机的进一步扩大和加深，国内市场和国外市场的进一步缩小，西德的经济危机的内在因素将逐步成熟，从某些主要工业部门扩大为全面危机的可能性是存在着和发展着的。
    军备生产　饮鸩止渴
    在日益发展的经济危机面前，西德资本家对工业发展的前景表现出惶惑和不安。但为了安定人心，一方面西德统治集团的报刊和联邦经济部长艾哈德断言西德不会出现“衰退”，以欺骗人民。但与此同时，为了垄断资本的最高利润，又不得不采取所谓“反危机措施”。这些措施有：
    第一，加紧扩军和军备生产竞赛。一年以前西德垄断资本尚未从事大量军火生产，这在政治上或在经济上对他们都有利。但是随着危机的来临，西德垄断资本对军火生产的兴趣更加浓厚起来，他们要求最大限度地减少国外军事订货，而在国内订货制造。最近已宣布撤销1958年2—3月间向英、法订购的飞机，决定自己仿造美F—104飞机装备空军。根据波恩—巴黎—罗马军备三角的决定，巨大的克虏伯公司将生产原子潜水艇。8月间西德国防部长施特劳斯答应拨款十亿马克资助火箭武器的研究工作。西德1958—59年度的军事预算是一百零七亿马克，除此以外，国防部还可动用六十亿马克——历年来开支的结余，共一百六十七亿马克，占1957年社会生产总值（二千一百零一亿）的7.9％，这一年度的军备费用几乎占四年来西德参加北大西洋集团所花费的军备费三百六十亿马克（合六十一亿八千八百万美元）总数的47％。军火生产可能对西德经济有些影响，但绝不能改变整个发展趋势。据“法兰克福论坛报”透露，1958—59财政年度预算的税收收入继续延缓，将比预定收入额减少九千万马克，赤字将达十七亿马克，这是近年来第一次赤字预算。下一预算年度可能更加困难，除税收进一步延缓外，西德军费预算还将增加到一百一十亿马克。为武装联邦国防军提供资金，西德还准备建立将近五十亿马克的货币储存。为此目的将通过把所得税和周转税提高10％的方法额外增加税收，同时减少社会福利、文化、科学以及其它非军事目的的支出，采用各种通货膨胀等办法。这些措施实行的结果都是降低劳动人民的生活水平，从而使生产与消费的矛盾更加尖锐化，促使危机的进一步发展。
    拚命扩张　你死我活
    第二，加强对外经济扩张和倾销政策。
    首先，为了解除煤炭销售危机，西德政府已经同意取消从美国进口六百万吨煤的合同，削减从美国进口煤的数量。同时又竭力压低煤价，向西欧国家实行倾销。西德政府的这种做法，引起了美国垄断资本的极大不满，加深了美国和西德的矛盾。
    其次，西德正在制定一个西德资本在资本主义世界市场进行扩张的广泛计划，竭力在这方面达到同美国和英国这样的大量资本输出国一样的水平，其主要输出对象是南美洲、非洲和亚洲的所谓“不发达国家”。这些国家，据西德资本家的统计，共有十五亿人口。这就是所谓“艾哈德计划”。这个计划最后将扩大到约六十个正在进行经济建设的非欧洲国家。据透露，作为这个计划组成部分之一的“亚洲艾哈德计划”规定建立一项十亿马克的基金，鼓励西德私人资本在亚洲国家进行投资，保证他们不遭到国有化和其它干涉的“政治危险”。去年10—11月间艾哈德周游印、缅等亚洲八国，其目的正是为实施这一计划创造条件。西德对中、近东各国的扩张正在加紧进行。西德对这些国家的贸易额虽然在其进出口总值中所占的比重并不大，但发展很快，如去年上半年比前年同期对这个地区的出口增加了29％，进口增加了22％。在拉丁美洲，西德的势力也在逐步扩大。在墨西哥、委内瑞拉、智利、古巴、危地马拉、秘鲁、阿根廷和乌拉圭，西德同美国的竞争正在加剧。有利的贸易条件，尤其是信贷条件，使这些国家提高了对西德商品的需求。西德资本甚至已渗入加拿大，这使美国感到非常不安。西德广泛的经济扩张，首先打击了英国的利益，同时也加剧了同几个主要帝国主义国家之间的矛盾。
    在西欧，随着经济危机的扩大和加深，各主要资本主义国家争夺销售市场和原料供应市场的竞争也更加尖锐化了。这一矛盾斗争最明显地表现在关于“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”的争吵上。西欧大陆是西德的主要市场之一。西德对西欧各国的出口额占其总出口额的60％上下（1957年达十七亿零六百八十多万英镑）。但是，由于西欧资本主义国家程度不等地发生了经济不稳的情况，这就不能不影响西德在西欧市场的地位。以1958年头九个月为例，西德向“共同市场”国家出口比前年同期减少了6％。因此，怎样保证西德继续在西欧市场上进行扩张，就成为西德垄断资本的一个迫切问题。西德垄断资本集团一方面企图控制西欧大陆各国的经济，成为“共同市场”的盟主，同时图谋在酝酿中的“自由贸易区”内取得领导权。为此西德就必须排挤主要竞争对手英国，将英国势力逐出欧洲大陆。而西欧市场对英国也是重要的。1957年英国对西欧各国的出口额达九亿三千八百多万英镑（占其出口总额的四分之一左右）。英国不愿意失掉西欧这一个传统的市场，而且企图借助于“自由贸易区”计划加强英国在西欧市场上的地位与争夺欧洲大陆经济的领导权。显然这是英国同西德间根本利害关系的尖锐冲突。目前在西欧出现的尖锐的法、英矛盾，实际上也包含着英国和西德的严重斗争。
    但是在欧洲大陆上，特别是在“共同市场”范围内，西德同法国也存在着严重的矛盾。然而斗争双方并不是势均力敌的。在经济实力方面，西德比法国处于有利的地位。西德对西欧各国的出口额相当于法国的两倍；法国又有求于西德，向西德借款用来开发非洲和进行阿尔及利亚战争。因此法国在经济上很难与西德相抗衡。但是戴高乐可以凭借某些政治条件来与阿登纳讨价还价。所有这些都说明，由于日益严重的经济危机和西德垄断资本的广泛的扩张，几个主要帝国主义国家间的矛盾，特别是西德同英、美、法的矛盾势将更趋尖锐化。
    总之，西德经济危机的来临并不是什么“意外的和例外的现象”，它是资本主义世界周期性经济危机发展的必然结果。生产的盲目扩张倾向和消费市场的有限发展及其逐渐缩小的趋势，这两者之间的矛盾发展必然导致严重的经济危机。人为的所谓“反危机措施”实行的结果不仅不能“消灭”危机，而且必将走到它的反面，最终使危机进一步加深和扩大。
