    Commemorate Louis Braille
    Learn from Louis Braille
    Xie Juezai, Chairman of the Chinese Blind Welfare Association

    The greatest suffering of blind people is their inability to see. Because they cannot see, it is even difficult to use the tool of human language—writing. Whoever can save blind people from this suffering will be eternally and sincerely thanked by them.

    To enable blind people to see everything with their eyes is not currently possible. But the method of enabling blind people to read and write existed in the past, and that is Louis Braille's creation of braille. Louis Braille was the first person to create braille. This year is the 150th anniversary of his birth, and it has also been 107 years since his death.

    Louis Braille was a blind person, a capable person. He devoted his life to the cause of the blind. Since his existence, blind people have no longer been culturally blind. Because Louis Braille was blind, he deeply experienced the pain of blind people being unable to read and write, and strived to create braille. This braille symbol, based on six raised dots, produces sixty-three variations, which are easy to learn and easy to write. This braille symbol can replace the letters of various national languages, thereby forming the braille systems of various countries. Louis Braille also compiled musical notation and mathematical symbols using six-dot braille. China's braille is also based on Louis Braille's work and has been supplemented and improved.

    It has been 120 years since Louis Braille created braille, and more than a century since his death, but most blind people in our country still do not know his name. Because the past society was not right, most blind people had very few opportunities to earn a living, so how could they talk about learning culture? A very small number of blind people in the cities learned braille, but it was useless, and they suffered from freezing and starvation just like those who did not know braille. However, this phenomenon has become a thing of the past. Since liberation, blind people in our country, like those in other socialist countries, have been guaranteed a livelihood and have the opportunity to learn science and technology and develop their talents.

    Since liberation, blind people's organizations and schools have been established, and braille publications have been published throughout our country. Blind people are no longer people forgotten by society. Since the Great Leap Forward, the ideological awareness of the blind masses has been greatly improved. There have been advanced figures among the blind on all fronts. If it was said that the students who graduated from blind training classes and schools for the blind last year had difficulty being fully assigned to work, now even if all the educated blind people in society are mobilized, it is not enough. Last year, our braille textbooks and braille teaching aids had surpluses, but now more are needed and fewer are being produced; especially the copper rulers and awls for writing braille need to be rushed to be made. This is a difficulty for those who work for the blind, but also a happy event for the work for the blind.

    Of course, compared with the Soviet Union, China's cause of the blind is still backward. We must learn from the Soviet Union, and we must continue to make a Great Leap Forward in our work for the blind. Today, as blind people in our country are commemorating the 150th anniversary of Louis Braille's birth, they should learn cultural and scientific knowledge with the perseverance of Louis Braille in creating braille for blind people, further improve their ideological awareness, make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland, and seek greater welfare for the blind masses in our country.

    Blind comrades throughout the country, work hard! Nourish ourselves with greater wisdom and strength from the 150th anniversary commemoration of Louis Braille.

    纪念路易·布莱尔
    学习路易·布莱尔
    中国盲人福利会主任委员　谢觉哉
    盲人最大的痛苦是眼睛看不见。因为眼睛看不见，所以连人类语言的工具——文字也很难运用了。谁能拯救盲人这个痛苦，盲人就会永远地衷心地感谢他。
    要使盲人的眼睛什么都看得见，现时还没有可能。但使盲人能够读书识字，这个办法过去就有了，那就是路易·布莱尔的创造盲字。路易·布莱尔是创制盲字的第一人。今年是他诞生一百五十周年，他逝世也有一百零七年了。
    路易·布莱尔是个盲人，是个有本事的人。他毕生致力于盲人事业。自从有了他，盲人在文化上就不再是盲人了。因为路易·布莱尔是个盲人，他深深体验到盲人无法识字作文的痛苦，努力创造了盲字。这种盲字符号，以六个凸点为基础，产生出六十三个变化，容易学习也容易书写。这种盲字符号可以代替各国文字字母，从而组成各国盲字体系。路易·布莱尔又以六点盲字编制了音乐符号和数学符号。我国盲文也是依据路易·布莱尔的制作而加以补充改进的。
    路易·布莱尔创造盲字已一百二十年，他逝世也已百多年了，我国大多数盲人还不知道他的名字。因为过去的社会不对头，大多数盲人谋衣食的机会很少，那能谈得上学文化？城市里极少数盲人学会盲文，也没有用处，同不识盲文的一样遭到冻饿。但是，这个现象已成为过去了。解放以来，我国盲人正在跟各社会主义国家一样，生活得到保障，并有机会学习科学和技术，发挥自己的才智。
    解放以来，我国各地建立了盲人组织、盲人学校、出版盲文刊物，盲人已不是被社会遗忘了的人。大跃进以来，盲人群众的思想觉悟更大大提高。在各个战线上都有了盲人的先进人物。如果说：去年盲人训练班、盲童学校毕业的学生，难以全部分配工作；现在就是把社会上所有有文化的盲人动员起来，也不够用。去年我们的盲文课本、盲文教具，还有多余，现在则要的多，出货少；尤其是写盲字的铜尺和锥子急需赶制。这是做盲人工作者的困难，也是盲人工作的喜事。
    当然，同苏联相比，我国的盲人事业还是落后的。我们一定向苏联学习，我们在盲人工作上一定要继续来个大跃进。今天，我国盲人正在纪念路易·布莱尔诞生一百五十周年的时候，应该以路易·布莱尔为盲人创造盲字的毅力来学习文化和科学知识，进一步提高思想觉悟，来为祖国社会主义建设贡献更大的力量，并为我国的盲人群众谋得更大的福利。
    全国的盲人同志们，努力罢！从路易·布莱尔的一百五十周年的纪念中滋养我们以更大的智慧和力量。
