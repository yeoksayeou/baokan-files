Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Chao'an County's Anbu People's Commune in Guangdong Province has vigorously reformed fertilizer accumulation tools, significantly increasing labor efficiency. In the past ten days, the entire commune mobilized 2,300 people daily to accumulate fertilizer, totaling 6.16 million dan, equivalent to twice the total fertilizer accumulation in the previous month.

    The fertilizer accumulation tools promoted by the Anbu Commune include aerial transport frames, wooden rail mud transport carts, mud lifting frames, swing-type mud delivery frames, balance-type mud lifting frames, elevator-type quick mud digging shovels, and tugboats. The whole commune has manufactured 1,620 pieces of fertilizer accumulation tools, of which 1,200 have already been used, with good results. These fertilizer accumulation tools are mainly suitable for digging pond mud and transporting fertilizer. For example, the mud lifting frame, operated by three people, can dig 270 dan of pond mud per hour, averaging 900 dan per person per day, increasing work efficiency by eight times. The swing-type mud delivery frame, operated by two people, can transport 840 dan of fertilizer per day, increasing efficiency by more than three times. The wooden rail mud transport cart is even more powerful, operated by four people, it can transport 4,084 dan of fertilizer per day, with an average of 1,021 dan of mud transported per person per day.

    The Anbu People's Commune is located in the Han River Delta, a densely populated area with limited land. When the reform of fertilizer accumulation tools began in earnest, some cadres and commune members did not initially feel that it was urgently necessary to promote new tools. The commune party committee then sent a party committee member to first mobilize commune members in the Xianxi Management District to manufacture several fertilizer accumulation tools such as wooden rail mud transport carts, mud lifting frames, and aerial transport frames, achieving success. Then a field meeting was held to mobilize cadres to visit and debate. At the field meeting, the cadres clarified the base of the entire commune's labor force, realizing that if tool reform was not carried out, even if all the more than 5,000 people participating in agricultural production were put into fertilizer accumulation, it would still take 27 days to accumulate sufficient fertilizer of 1,000 dan per mu for the 13,500 mu of early rice paddy fields. After visiting and debating, everyone's enthusiasm for tool reform was increased. On the spot, more than 60 people ran home to get fir wood and other materials to manufacture fertilizer accumulation tools, and erected 30 mud lifting frames and swing frames. After the field meeting, a tool reform movement was launched throughout the commune.

    According to the Fujian Daily, Haicheng County has been vigorously carrying out tool reform in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, with various rapid fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools being continuously created and promoted, increasing the average fertilizer accumulation by 50% throughout the county.

    Under the leadership of cadres and the joint experimentation of the masses, Haicheng County created nine particularly efficient fertilizer accumulation tools in one week and quickly promoted them to various communes. Dongtouying of the Satellite Commune created a method of levering river mud, which is five times more efficient than manual digging and carrying. The Baishuiying of this commune's wooden rail train fertilizer delivery method allows one person to transport 37 dan of fertilizer per hour, which is one times more efficient than manual carrying. The Lianhua Commune's Limingying created an aerial bridge sliding soil line, which requires one person to operate and is equivalent to three laborers. Ziyouying dug mud in a dry pond, using oxen to plow the soil instead of people digging, increasing from 300 dan of soil dug per person per day to 1,200 dan. The Fengshanying's rope traction rapid fertilizer accumulation vehicle can accumulate 400 dan of fertilizer per day. In addition, various places also made full use of all available natural conditions to realize the vehicle and boat transportation of fertilizer. In order to transport sea fertilizer to barren fields to improve the soil, Ziyouying first rushed to repair a more than three-mile-long ox cart road, and then used 49 handcarts and ox carts to carry sea soil up the mountain, transporting more than 30,000 dan in three days, twice as fast as manual labor. The coastal yings such as Xialou and Yuzhen also used small boats to carry soil and fertilizer, greatly saving labor.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 23rd: In the fields of the Xiliao River Basin, many sleds loaded with manure have recently appeared, traveling back and forth along smooth ice tracks. This is a new method of fertilizer transportation jointly created by Mongolian and Han farmers in the Jirem League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    Ice track transportation of fertilizer is very efficient, saving a large amount of manpower and animal power. The First Work Zone of the Yuejin Commune in the suburbs of Tongliao City transported more than 1.9 million jin of peat fertilizer to the fields in two days, more than ten times more efficient than dry road cart transportation. All 36 million jin of peat fertilizer in the entire work zone can be transported to the fields before the Spring Festival. A ranch in the Hongqi Commune of Naiman Banner is 20 kilometers away from the commune. In the past, due to insufficient transportation capacity and poor road conditions, a large amount of manure accumulated on the ranch was abandoned unused. Recently, commune members have used ice track transportation to transport high-quality cattle and sheep manure to the fields one after another. They also used ice tracks to transport firewood and fodder.

    According to the Sichuan Daily, employees of the Xinnianqing Fertilizer Factory in Guanyin People's Commune, Pengshan County, recently made a multi-purpose animal-powered fertilizer making machine. This machine can crush raw materials, screen ash, mix materials and granulate, producing more than 15,000 jin of soil fertilizer per day, increasing work efficiency more than nine times compared to the original manual operation.

    This set of fertilizer making machine is made by modifying the rice milling groove roller (flat roller). Its main components are: (1) a "ball mill" used to crush raw materials, made of hard wood and drilled silk bamboo strips, shaped like a round barrel. The rotation of the machine causes the raw materials to collide with each other. (2) A ash screening machine, the size of the screen hole can be adjusted, the screen head has a feeding shuttle, and a material trough is set below to hold the finished product. (3) A mixing machine, which is a semi-circular mixing trough. When the machine rotates, it can mix raw materials evenly. The mixing trough is equipped with water spraying equipment, which can make the raw material for granular fertilizer in the trough. (4) A granulating machine, like a drum, is placed obliquely on a wooden frame. A large shuttle hopper is installed at the top end, and iron claws are installed inside to help discharge materials. A round sieve is connected to the tail, and the machine can granulate the raw materials into granular fertilizer after starting. At present, the employees of this fertilizer factory are considering using water power or other power to drive this machine instead of animal power.

    办法巧妙　运肥效高
    据新华社广州讯　广东潮安县庵埠人民公社大搞积肥工具改革，劳动效率显著提高。最近十天，全公社每天出动二千三百人积肥，共积肥六百一十六万担，相当于以前一个多月积肥总量的两倍。
    庵埠公社推广的积肥工具有空中运输架、木轨运坭车、吊坭架、秋千式送坭架、天平式吊坭架、升降机快速挖坭锹、牵引船七种。全社已经制造了积肥工具一千六百二十件，其中已经使用的有一千二百件，效果良好。这些积肥工具主要适用于挖塘坭和运输肥料。例如吊坭架，每架三人操作，每小时可挖塘坭二百七十担，平均每人每天九百担，工作效率提高八倍。秋千式送坭架，每架两人操作，每天可运肥八百四十担，提高效率三倍多。木轨运坭车威力更大，四人操作，每天运肥四千零八十四担，平均每人每天运坭达到了一千零二十一担。
    庵埠人民公社地处韩江三角洲的人多地少的地区。在开始大搞积肥工具改革时，有些干部和社员原来并不认为那样迫切需要推广新工具。公社党委便派了一个党委委员，首先在仙溪管理区发动社员制造木轨运坭车、吊坭架、空中运输架等几种积肥工具，取得成绩，然后召开现场会议，发动干部边参观边辩论。在现场会议上，干部们弄清了全社劳动力的底子，认识到如果不进行工具改革，即使把参加农业生产的五千多人全部投入积肥，也需要二十七天才能为一万三千五百亩早稻稻田每亩积足一千担肥料。经过参观和辩论，提高了大家改革工具的积极性，当场便有六十多人跑回家拿杉木等制造积肥工具，搭起吊坭架、秋千架三十件。现场会议后，全公社就掀起了工具改革运动。
    据福建日报报道　海澄县在积肥运动中大闹工具改革，各种快速积肥、运肥工具不断创造和推广，使全县平均积肥量提高了50％。
    海澄县在干部深入领导，和群众共同试验下，在一个星期中创造出九种效率特别高的积肥工具，并迅速推广到各个公社。卫星公社东头营创造了杠杆吊河泥的办法，比人工挖、挑效率高五倍。这个公社的白水营的木轨小火车送肥法，一人操作每小时可运肥三十七担，比人工挑效率高一倍。莲花公社黎明营创造的天桥滑土线，一人操作可抵上三个劳力。自由营在干塘中挖泥，用耕牛犁土代替人挖，由每人每天挖土三百担提高到一千二百担。凤山营的绳索牵引快速积肥车，每天可积肥四百担。此外，各地还充分利用一切可以利用的自然条件，实现运肥车船化。自由营为了把海肥运到瘦田里改良土壤，先抢修好一条三里多长的牛车路，然后用四十九辆手推车和牛车载着海土上山，三天中载运三万多担，比人工快二倍。下楼、玉枕等沿海营也都利用小船载土载肥，大大节省劳力。
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电　在西辽河流域的田野上，最近出现了许多满载粪肥的爬犁，沿着平整光滑的冰道往来奔驰。这是内蒙古自治区哲里木盟蒙古族和汉族农民共同创造的运肥新办法。
    冰道运肥效率很高，可以节省大批人力、畜力。通辽市郊区跃进公社第一作业区在两天内就把一百九十多万斤草炭肥送到田里，比旱路大车运输效率提高十倍以上。全作业区三千六百万斤草炭肥，春节以前就可全部运到田里。奈曼旗红旗公社有一个牧场，离社二十公里远，过去由于运输力不足，路不好走，牧场上积存大量粪肥一直弃置未用。最近社员们利用冰道运输，已把质量很好的牛羊粪陆续运到田里去，他们还利用冰道运送烧柴、饲草。
    据四川日报报道　彭山县观音人民公社新青年化肥厂职工，最近制成一台万能畜力造肥机。这台机器可以粉碎原料、筛灰、拌料和制粒，日制土化肥一万五千多斤，比原来手工操作提高工效九倍以上。
    这套造肥机是利用碾米的槽碾（平碾）改装制成的，它的主要部件有：（一）用来粉碎原料的“球磨机”，用坚硬木料和钻丝篾条制成，形状如圆桶，机器转动使原料互相撞击。（二）筛灰机，筛孔大小可以调节，筛头上有加料梭斗，下面设有料槽，可装运成品。（三）拌料机，是一个半圆形的拌料槽，机器转动时可以把原料和拌均匀，拌料槽上面装有喷水设备，可在槽内制成颗粒肥的原料。（四）制粒机，像一滚筒，斜放在一个木架上，头上端安一个大梭料斗，内安铁爪帮助下料，尾部接圆筛子，机器开动后即可将原料制成颗粒肥。目前，这个制肥厂的职工正考虑利用水力或其他动力代替畜力来带动这台机器。
