    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 25th: Over 300,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a protest rally at Ba Dinh Square this morning, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialist-Ngo Dinh Diem group's crime of using poison to kill more than 1,000 former resistance members and patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. The 300,000 people enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Oppose the U.S.-Ngo group's killing of South Vietnamese compatriots," "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam," and "All concentration camps in South Vietnam must be dissolved."
    This was the largest mass demonstration in Vietnamese history. The number of people gathered accounted for more than half of Hanoi's population. The square was covered with slogans, flags, and cartoons, and everyone wore black纱 (shā) on their arms to express mourning for the martyred heroes.
    Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai attended the meeting. The presidium of the meeting included 31 representatives of parties, the National Assembly, the Fatherland Front, various ethnic groups, religious circles, and heroic models, including Le Duan, Ton Duc Thang, Le Dinh Tham, Nguyen Xuan Thuy, and Phan Van Chuong.
    Phan Van Chuong, Chairman of the "Phu Loi Massacre Struggle Committee" and former Mayor of Saigon, said in his speech that today we are gathering here to express the anger of the entire nation and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist-instigated atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem group in killing patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. The U.S.-Ngo group is an irreconcilable enemy of the Vietnamese nation. Their atrocities seriously violated Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords.
    Phan Van Chuong said that the more than 1,000 former resistance members and patriots murdered by the enemy are all respectable and beloved sons and daughters of the people, and their staunch and unyielding fighting spirit is worthy of our learning. He said that the Vietnamese people must use practical actions of struggle, production, and labor to avenge the martyred heroes.
    Phan Van Chuong said that the flames of hatred are burning fiercely in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. In recent days, people have gathered and marched, and more than 100 delegations have submitted proposals to the International Commission. Phan Van Chuong finally called on the Vietnamese people to transform grief and indignation into strength and actively devote themselves to the heated struggle of building North Vietnam and striving for the reunification of the motherland. His speech was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic slogans.
    At 9:30, the sirens blared, and the people of the city observed a moment of silence for the more than 1,000 martyred heroes of the Phu Loi concentration camp.
    At the end of the meeting, amid angry slogans, the proposal to the International Commission was passed. It demanded that the International Commission send people to the site to investigate; demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities provide first aid to the people still alive in the Phu Loi concentration camp and restore their freedom; demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities must announce the list of more than 1,000 victims of the Phu Loi massacre and the political prisoners still alive in the Phu Loi concentration camp; demanded the dissolution of all concentration camps in South Vietnam; demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities stop the policy of persecuting former resistance members and those who demand peaceful reunification; and demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities guarantee the people's rights to freedom and democracy.
    Subsequently, a massive procession of more than 300,000 people marched on more than a dozen streets in the city. Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Ke Toai, and all members of the presidium of the meeting participated in the demonstration. (Attached photo)

    抗议美国和吴庭艳集团屠杀爱国者
    河内举行历史空前大示威
    新华社河内25日电　河内三十多万各界人民今天上午在巴亭广场举行抗议大会，强烈抗议美帝国主义—吴庭艳集团用毒药杀害富利集中营一千多名前抗战人员和爱国者的罪行。三十多万人激昂地高呼“反对美吴集团杀害南越同胞”、“美帝国主义从南越滚出去”、“必须解散南越一切集中营”等口号。
    这是越南历史上规模最大的一次群众示威运动。集会人数占河内人口的一大半。广场上到处是标语，旗帜和漫画，每人臂上都戴上黑纱，表示对死难烈士的哀悼。
    越南总理范文同、副总理潘继遂出席了大会。大会主席团有黎笋、孙德胜、黎廷探、阮春水、潘文章等三十一名党派、国会、祖国战线、各民族、宗教界、英雄模范的代表。
    “富利惨案斗争委员会”主席、前西贡市市长潘文章在会上讲话时说，今天我们在这里集会表示全民族的愤怒和坚决反对美帝国主义唆使吴庭艳集团杀害富利集中营爱国者的暴行。美吴集团是越南民族不共戴天的敌人。他们的暴行严重地违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款的规定。
    潘文章说，敌人害杀的一千多名前抗战人员和爱国者都是人民可敬可爱的儿女，他们坚贞不屈的斗争精神值得我们学习。他说，越南人民必须用实际的斗争、生产、劳动的行动来为死难的烈士们报仇。
    潘文章说，仇恨的怒火正在越南人民的心里熊熊燃烧。几天来，人民纷纷集会和游行，并且派了一百多个代表团向国际委员会递交了建议书。潘文章最后号召越南人民把悲愤化为力量，积极投入建设越南北方和争取统一祖国的火热斗争中去。他的讲话不断地被激昂的口号声所打断。
    九时三十分，汽笛长鸣，全市人民为富利集中营一千多名死难烈士默哀。
    大会最后在愤怒的口号声中通过了给国际委员会的建议书。要求国际委员会派人到现场调查；要求南越当局对富利集中营里还活着的人进行急救和恢复他们的自由；一定要南越当局公布富利惨案一千多名死难者和富利集中营里还活着的政治犯的名单；要求解散南越一切集中营；要求南越当局停止实行迫害前抗战人员和要求和平统一人士的政策；要求南越当局保障人民的自由民主权利。
    随后，三十多万人的队伍浩浩荡荡地在市内十多条街道上举行了示威游行。范文同总理、潘继遂副总理和大会主席团全体成员都参加了示威游行。（附图片）
