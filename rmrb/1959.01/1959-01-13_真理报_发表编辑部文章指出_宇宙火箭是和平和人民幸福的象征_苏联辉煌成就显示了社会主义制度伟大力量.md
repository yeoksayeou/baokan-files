Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: The "Pravda" newspaper published an editorial on the 12th entitled "For the Benefit of Mankind," excerpts of which are as follows:

Our motherland, filled with powerful strength and boundless energy, is welcoming the 21st Congress of the CPSU—the congress of communist builders.

The first few days of the new year marked a great victory for the creative genius of the Soviet people—the launch of a cosmic rocket towards the moon, creating the first man-made planet in the solar system.

This is an outstanding achievement of Soviet science and technology. It convincingly demonstrates what victories can be achieved by a people marching under the leadership of the Communist Party along the road illuminated by the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. This achievement vividly shows that the socialist system promotes the leaping development of economy, science, technology, and culture, opening up a vast world for our people to unleash their rich heroism and genius.

The Great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, an era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. Shortly after the October Revolution, Lenin said: "All the wisdom of mankind, all the creations of human genius, were only for giving all the benefits of technology and culture to a part of the people and depriving the other part of the most necessary things—enlightenment and development. Now all the wonders of technology, all the achievements of culture, have become the property of the whole people." Today, everyone has seen the great correctness of Lenin's words.

In order to reach the summit of science and advanced technology that the Soviet Union has now reached, our people had to go through a long and complex road—realizing the socialist industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, completing the cultural revolution, and turning our motherland into an impregnable socialist fortress. On this road, we encountered numerous difficulties and trials, but the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, gloriously overcame these difficulties and showed the world their high level of consciousness and their indomitable will to fight for great goals.

The current high level of development of Soviet productive forces makes it possible to solve new and magnificent tasks of communist construction.

The brilliant achievements of the Soviet state in the latest departments of modern science and technology and in decisive aspects, namely in the utilization of atomic energy, the construction of jet aircraft and intercontinental ballistic rockets, have shaken the world. It is our socialist motherland that has opened a new era of science and technology, the first to build and successfully launch artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets.

The coming Seven-Year Plan presents a more expansive picture of the development of Soviet science. We will create the necessary conditions to more rapidly develop all scientific departments, carry out important theoretical research and greater scientific inventions. To this end, a broad plan for scientific research work is being formulated, and it is planned to concentrate all scientific manpower and resources to carry out the most important research work with theoretical and practical significance.

The Soviet people believe that in the coming seven years, all our scientists who have revealed the secrets of atomic and thermonuclear reactions and built artificial earth satellites and cosmic rockets will enrich science with more great inventions and achievements.

Our people of all nationalities are filled with enormous patriotic pride in their great socialist motherland—the Soviet Union, as the cosmic rocket carries the mark with the Soviet national emblem high towards the sun.

The news of the Soviet Union's construction and launch of a cosmic rocket shook the world and exceeded human imagination. This news made China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the countries of the powerful and unbreakable socialist camp very happy.

Every honest person in the world is celebrating the great achievements of the country that is building communism together with the Soviet people. Millions of people believe that these achievements are a victory of Soviet science and technology, a proof of the great power of the socialist system, and a proof that the socialist system is infinitely superior to capitalism.

The launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket has caused astonishment and confusion among those who are unfriendly to the Soviet Union. Some stubborn elements in the capitalist world are attempting to use the Soviet rocket launch as an excuse to launch a "cold war" and engage in an arms race. However, honest people in all countries of the world justly believe that the Soviet cosmic rocket is a symbol of peace and people's happiness.

The Soviet cosmic rocket has reached a height that no one in the entire history of mankind has reached, which fills the Soviet people with inner pride and inspires them to achieve new merits in communist construction. (Attached picture)

    “真理报”发表编辑部文章指出
    宇宙火箭是和平和人民幸福的象征
    苏联辉煌成就显示了社会主义制度伟大力量
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”12日发表题为“造福人类”的一篇编辑部文章，摘要如下：
    充满强大力量和无穷精力的我们祖国正在迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会——共产主义建设者的代表大会。
    新年的头几天标志着苏联人民创造天才的伟大胜利——向月球方向发射了宇宙火箭，创造了太阳系中第一个人造行星。
    这是苏联科学技术杰出的成就。它令人信服地表明，在共产党领导下沿着马克思列宁主义伟大学说照耀的道路前进的人民，能够取得怎样的胜利。这一成就鲜明地表明，社会主义制度促进经济、科学、技术和文化的飞跃发展，为我国人民发挥他们所富有的英雄气概和天才开辟了广阔天地。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了人类历史的新纪元，开辟了资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的纪元。在十月革命后不久列宁说过：“以往全部人类智慧、全部人类天才的创造，只是为了把技术和文化的一切财富给予一部分人，而剥夺另一部分人最必需的东西——启蒙和发展。现在一切技术奇迹、一切文化成果都成为全民的财产。”如今大家都已看到列宁的话的伟大正确性。
    为了达到苏联现在已经达到的如此高超的科学和先进技术的顶峰，我国人民曾经不得不通过漫长而复杂的道路——实现国家的社会主义工业化和农业的集体化，完成文化革命，把我们祖国变成攻不破的社会主义堡垒。在这条道路上遇到过重重困难和考验，但是，苏联人民在共产党的领导下光荣地克服了这些困难，并向全世界显示了他们高度的自觉性和为达到伟大目标而斗争的不屈不挠的意志。
    现在苏联生产力发展水平之高，使得有可能解决共产主义建设的新的宏伟任务。
    苏维埃国家在现代科学技术最新部门和具有决定性的方面，即在利用原子能、建造喷气式飞机和洲际弹道火箭方面所取得的辉煌成就震动了全世界。正是我们社会主义祖国开辟了科学技术的新纪元，第一个建造了和成功地发射了人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭。
    在已经来临的七年计划中呈现着苏联科学发展更加广阔的图景。我们将创造必要的条件来更加迅速地发展一切科学部门、进行重要的理论研究和更大的科学发明。为此，正在制订广泛的科学研究工作规划，并拟定集中一切科学上的人力和物力来进行具有理论和实际意义的最重大的研究工作。
    苏联人民相信，在已经来临的七年中，我们一切揭露原子和热核反应秘密的、建造人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭的科学家将用更多的大发明和成就来丰富科学。
    我国各族人民对自己伟大的社会主义祖国——苏联充满了巨大爱国主义自豪感，宇宙火箭把带有苏联国徽的标记高高地升向太阳。
    苏联建造和发射宇宙火箭的消息震撼了全世界，突破了人类的想像力。这一消息使中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和强大的牢不可破的社会主义阵营各国感到十分高兴。
    世界上每一个正直的人都在和苏联人民一道欢庆正在建设共产主义的国家取得伟大的成就。千百万人民都认为，这些成就是苏联科学技术的胜利，是社会主义制度伟大力量的证明，是社会主义制度比资本主义无比优越的证明。
    苏联宇宙火箭的发射引起了对苏联不友好的人的惊奇和混乱。资本主义世界某些顽固分子企图利用苏联发射火箭作为借口来发动“冷战”和进行军备竞赛。但是，世界各国正直的人公正地认为，苏联宇宙火箭是和平和人民幸福的象征。
    苏联宇宙火箭达到人类整个历史中谁也没有达到的高度，这使苏联人充满内心的骄傲，鼓舞他们在共产主义建设中获得新的功绩。（附图片）
