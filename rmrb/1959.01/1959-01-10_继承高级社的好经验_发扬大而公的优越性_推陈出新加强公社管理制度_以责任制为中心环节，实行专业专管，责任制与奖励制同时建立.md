    Jiangsu Province Commune Management Conference Proposes Commune Management Principles and Methods
    This newspaper Nanjing, 9th dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial People's Commune operation and management conference in Suzhou from December 29th of last year to January 3rd of this year, requiring all localities to establish a set of management systems suitable for the nature and tasks of the People's Commune on the basis of inheriting the management experience of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, so that the superiority of the People's Commune can be brought into fuller play.
    The conference listened to the work reports from various places and believed that the operation and management system of the People's Commune should have great development compared with the advanced agricultural production cooperative, but it must also be based on the original management system of the advanced agricultural production cooperative, selectively taking the good aspects, discard the bad aspects and improve on it. It is not right to stay at the original level, and it is not right to completely discard the original foundation.
    The conference focused on studying the establishment and improvement of various responsibility systems of the People's Commune, believing that this is the central link in improving operation and management at present. It requires all localities to establish and improve labor organizations at all levels and establish and improve responsibility systems in all aspects in accordance with the principles of unified leadership, overall planning, hierarchical management, and distribution according to labor.
    The conference believed that the labor organization of the People's Commune should be divided into three levels: the commune, the management area (or brigade), and the production team. The scale of the commune should generally adhere to one commune per township at present. The management area (brigade) should generally be suitable for about 500 households, preferably based on the original agricultural production cooperative, one cooperative per area. The scale of the production team should not be too large, generally suitable for about 50 households. The labor organization of the People's Commune must gradually develop in the direction of industrialization (i.e., militarization). Implementing specialized management is an important step towards industrialization. Therefore, the division of labor in the production labor of the People's Commune must be as specialized as possible. In order to fully and rationally utilize labor and enable everyone to gradually develop in the direction of being multi-skilled, each specialized organization should combine the operation of some other production projects as much as possible on the premise of not affecting the main business, and implement comprehensive operation. And on the basis of specialized management, organize large-scale collaboration and surprise attacks when necessary.
    The conference believed that the responsibility system must be established simultaneously with the reward system. In order to further promote the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the broad masses of peasants under the premise of giving prominence to politics, it was decided that each commune would implement a “three-fixed” collective responsibility system for the management area (brigade), the management area (brigade) for the production team, namely, fixed output (yield or output value), fixed cost, and fixed work (communes implementing the wage system fix wages, and communes not implementing the wage system fix labor days). The production team should also implement a "five-fixed" responsibility system for each labor group, namely, fixed land, fixed measures, fixed time, fixed personnel, and fixed means of production (such as fertilizers, draft animals, farm tools, etc.). Factories, mines, enterprises, and other specialized organizations within the commune should also establish corresponding responsibility systems for their subordinate labor groups with reference to the above methods. A system of responsibility fields should also be established in agricultural production labor groups, stipulating necessary reward measures.
    The People's Commune implements a fixed quota work recording responsibility system for the labor of its members. In People's Communes that have already implemented the wage system, the number of labor quotas completed by each member and the number of days of attendance should be used as the main basis for evaluating wage grades (but special circumstances such as illness should be taken into account). Some members who have not been assessed for wage levels are treated as auxiliary labor and paid according to the actual number of labor days worked. In those People's Communes that have not yet implemented the wage system, the part distributed according to labor should be pre-paid and distributed according to the actual number of labor days worked. After the implementation of the fixed quota work recording responsibility system, the attendance and labor of each member should be evaluated and recorded in a timely and accurate manner, but work should not be evaluated every day. Generally, daily records and sectional evaluations, or daily records, monthly evaluations, and quarterly evaluations can be adopted. The People's Commune should also establish a strict custodial responsibility system for draft animals, grain, farm tools, and other materials.
    The conference also discussed the issue of the People's Commune's planning management, believing that the People's Commune must strengthen the commune's planning management of production, distribution, labor, and finance based on the characteristics of combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, and based on the principle of combining industry and agriculture, combining self-sufficient production and commodity production.
    The conference also discussed the commune's financial management, life management, and democratic management in accordance with the principles of running the commune diligently and thriftily and running the commune democratically. The conference believed that the financial management work of the People's Commune must be placed under the unified leadership and supervision of the commune, and at the same time, a certain degree of flexibility must be given to organizations at all levels. The commune implements a "four unified, five contracted" financial management system for the management area (brigade) and directly affiliated specialized organizations. The "four unified" are: unified calculation of profits and losses; unified distribution; unified use of commune accumulation; and unified stipulation of the expenditure of various expenses (including production costs, miscellaneous expenses, welfare expenses, etc.). The "five contracted" are: contracted production costs; contracted office expenses and miscellaneous expenses; contracted expenses for adding and repairing draft animals and farm tools; contracted canteen food expenses; and contracted welfare expenses for members. The management area (brigade) contracts the above contracted items to the production team and its affiliated specialized organizations separately as needed. During the discussion of improving the financial system, the conference paid close attention to the excessive non-production expenditures of some People's Communes at present, believing that various non-production expenditures of the People's Commune must be strictly controlled.
    In terms of democratizing management, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work, educate cadres to consult with the masses on matters, regularly publish accounts to members, establish and improve the system of member representative assemblies, and especially adhere to the principle of cadres eating and laboring together with members. The conference put forward a number of specific provisions for these aspects.
    The conference requires every cadre of the People's Commune and rural work cadre to earnestly and repeatedly study the central government's instructions and resolutions on the People's Commune, to go deep into the problems in operation and management, to learn from the masses, to learn from the cadres of the original agricultural production cooperatives and production teams, and to strive to learn how to do specific economic work in the shortest possible time, and to become more and more detailed, refined, deep, and thorough, and become experts in managing the People's Commune.

    继承高级社的好经验  发扬大而公的优越性
    推陈出新加强公社管理制度
    以责任制为中心环节，实行专业专管，责任制与奖励制同时建立
    江苏省公社经营管理会议提出公社管理原则和办法
    本报南京9日电　中共江苏省委从去年12月29日至今年1月3日，在苏州召开了全省人民公社经营管理会议，要求各地在继承高级社的管理经验的基础上，建立起一套适合人民公社的性质和任务的管理制度，使人民公社的优越性发挥得更加充分。
    会议听取了各地的工作汇报，认为：人民公社的经营管理制度，应该比高级农业生产合作社有很大发展，但又必须在原来高级农业生产合作社的管理制度的基础上，有分析地加以取舍，加以改进。停留在原有水平上是不对的，把原有的基础完全丢掉也是不对的。
    会议着重研究了建立和健全人民公社的各种责任制的问题，认为这是当前改进经营管理的中心环节。要求各地根据统一领导、全面规划、分级管理和按劳分配的原则，建立和健全各级劳动组织，建立和健全各方面的责任制。
    会议认为，人民公社的劳动组织，应该分公社、管理区（或大队）、生产队三级。公社的规模，在目前一般应坚持一乡一社。管理区（大队）一般以五百户左右为宜，最好以原来农业生产合作社为基础，一社一区。生产队的规模不宜过大，一般以五十户左右为宜。人民公社的劳动组织，必须逐步向工厂化（即军事化）的方向发展。实行专业专管，是走向工厂化的一个重要步骤。因此，人民公社的生产劳动的分工，必须尽量做到专业化。为了充分合理地利用劳动力，使每一个人都能逐步向多面手的方向发展，各个专业组织，在不影响主业的前提下，应当尽量结合经营一些别的生产项目，实行综合经营。并且在专业专管的基础上，在必要时组织大规模的协作和突击。
    会议认为责任制度必须和奖励制度同时建立。为了在政治挂帅的前提下，进一步发扬广大农民的积极性和责任心，决定由各公社对管理区
  （大队）、管理区（大队）对生产队实行定产（产量或产值）、定本、定工（实行工资制的公社定工资，未实行工资制的公社定劳动日）的“三定”集体责任制。生产队对各个劳动组，也要实行定土地、定措施、定时间、定人员、定生产资料（如肥料、耕畜、农具等）的“五定”责任制。社内各厂、矿、企业和其他专业组织对所属的劳动组，也要参照上述办法，建立相应的责任制度，在农业生产劳动组里，还要建立责任田的制度，规定必要的奖励办法。
    人民公社对社员的劳动，实行定额记工责任制。在已经实行工资制的人民公社中，应当把每一个社员完成劳动定额的数量和出勤的天数，作为评定工资等级的主要依据（但对生病等特殊情况应当给予照顾），有些未评定工资级别的社员，作为辅助劳动力，按实做劳动日给酬。在那些尚未实行工资制的人民公社中，按劳分配部分，应当按实做劳动日进行预支和分配。在实行定额记工责任制以后，要及时、正确地评定和记录每个社员的出勤和劳动情况，但不要天天评工，一般可以采取日记段评，或者日记月评、季评的方法。人民公社对于耕畜、粮食、农具和其它物资，也要建立严格的保管责任制。
    会议还讨论了人民公社的计划管理问题，认为人民公社必须根据工农商学兵相结合的特点，根据工农业并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，加强公社对生产、分配、劳动、财务的计划管理。
    会议还根据勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，讨论了公社的财务管理、生活管理和民主管理问题。会议认为：人民公社的财务管理工作，必须置于公社的统一领导和监督之下，同时，又要给各级组织一定的机动。公社对管理区（大队）和直属的各种专业组织实行“四统、五包”的财务管理制度。“四统”是：统一计算盈亏；统一分配；统一使用公社积累；统一规定各种费用的开支（包括生产费、杂支费、福利费等等）。“五包”是：生产费用包干；办公费、杂支费包干；耕畜农具的添置修理费包干；食堂伙食费包干；社员福利费包干。管理区（大队）按照以上包干项目，根据需要有分别地包到生产队和所属的专业组织。会议在讨论健全财务制度时，对于目前部分人民公社的非生产开支过大，极为注意，认为人民公社的各种非生产开支，必须严加控制。
    在管理民主化方面，要加强政治思想工作，教育干部有事和群众商量，定期向社员公布账目，建立和健全社员代表大会的制度，特别要坚持干部和社员同吃同劳动。会议对于这些方面，都提出了若干具体的规定。
    会议要求每一个人民公社干部和农村工作干部，都要认真地反复地学习中央有关人民公社的指示、决议，都要深入下去摸一摸经营管理中的问题，向群众学习，向原来农业生产合作社和生产队的干部学习，争取在最短的时间内，学会做具体的经济工作，并且要越做越细、越精、越深、越透，成为管理人民公社的能手。
