From the Overall Task of Socialist Construction Serving Economic and National Defense Construction
Unifying National Strength to Develop Science and Technology
Localities Should Establish Regional Science and Technology Work While Ensuring the Principle of "The Whole Nation as a Single Chessboard"
National Conference on Local Science and Technology Work Discussed This Year's Great Leap Forward Plan
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 15th: The National Conference on Local Science and Technology Work, convened in Shanghai on December 22, 1958, concluded on January 4th. The conference, based on the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the targets for the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session for 1959, studied the current situation of science and technology work, discussed the Draft Plan for the Development of Science and Technology in 1959, and exchanged experiences in science and technology work from various departments and localities.

This conference was presided over by the State Science and Technology Commission. More than two hundred and eighty leading cadres of science and technology from central departments and provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country participated in the conference.

Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, delivered reports at the meeting.
The Main Points of This Year's Science and Technology Development Plan
\tContinue to Strengthen the Work on Several Emerging Cutting-Edge Technologies -- Use Extensive Work to Solve Scientific and Technical Problems in Industrial and Agricultural Production and Construction, Summarize the Experience Created by the Masses -- Strengthen Medical Research, Including Theoretical Research and Experience Summarization of Traditional Chinese Medicine -- Develop Theoretical Research in Basic Disciplines
Nie Rongzhen gave a general account of the development of science and technology in our country, and pointed out the main points of the Draft Plan for the Development of Science and Technology in 1959. He said that this year we are required to continue strengthening the work on several emerging cutting-edge technologies; we are required to use extensive work to solve the scientific and technical problems in industrial and agricultural production and construction, and summarize the experience created by the masses; we are required to strengthen medical research, including theoretical research and experience summarization of traditional Chinese medicine; and we are required to develop theoretical research in basic disciplines. While carrying out the above work, we must attach great importance to the popularization of scientific research achievements and advanced experiences, especially for the many new achievements and advanced experiences that have emerged in 1958, we should take measures to summarize, appraise, and rapidly apply them to production. In the arrangement of tasks, we must grasp the key issues, strengthen weak links and eliminate blank areas, and serve the current urgent needs and long-term development.

Next, Nie Rongzhen, based on the current situation and tasks of science and technology work, pointed out several issues related to the development of science and technology in our country, the path forward, as well as ideological methods and work style. He said that first, science and technology work must proceed from the overall task of socialist construction and serve economic and national defense construction. The compilation of the 1959 Science and Technology Development Plan started from the needs of economic construction and national defense construction. The main criterion for measuring how well the science and technology work is done in 1959 is to see whether it can adapt to and promote the development of economic construction and national defense construction. Second, in order to realize this year's science and technology work tasks, we must make overall arrangements for the national strength and implement the Party's mass line and the principle of division of labor and collaboration between the central and local governments. Localities should establish regional science and technology work while ensuring the principle of "the whole nation as a single chessboard." Third, we must improve the ideological methods and work style of science and technology workers, combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific attitude, and improve the level of leadership. Breaking superstitions is necessary for the development of science, but we should not deny scientific truths under the pretext of breaking superstitions.

During the conference, Han Guang, Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Commission, explained the draft of the 1959 Science and Technology Development Plan. Responsible comrades from various central departments and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as several Deputy Directors of the State Science and Technology Commission, made special speeches on various aspects of science and technology work; leading cadres of science and technology work from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions also made speeches on science and technology work at the meeting. During the conference, representatives from various regions also held more than a dozen professional symposiums.
Last Year Was a Year of Great Harvest in Science and Technology
A New Situation of the Whole Party and the Whole People Vigorously Engaging in Science and Technology and Launching a Technical Revolution is Forming -- The Level of Science and Technology Has Been Significantly Improved -- A Scientific and Technological Contingent Composed of Worker-Peasant Innovators, Young Scientists and Technicians, and Veteran Experts is Growing

The conference reviewed the work of the past three years. Since the formulation of the Twelve-Year Plan for the Development of Science and Technology in 1956, our country's science and technology work, under the leadership of the Party, through the efforts of all science and technology workers and the broad masses, and with the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, has achieved many great achievements. Especially since the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and driven by the situation of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the past situation of a few people engaging in science and technology in a cold and desolate manner has been swept away, and a new situation of the whole Party and the whole people vigorously engaging in science and technology and launching a technical revolution has been formed, and the face of science and technology in our country has undergone great changes.

In the past three years, the level of science and technology in our country has been significantly improved. There has been rapid development in several emerging cutting-edge science and technology fields. In the field of industrial science and technology, while striving to master modern scientific and technological achievements, we have also done a lot of creative work. For example, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces in the metallurgical industry has entered the world's advanced ranks; a non-chromium-nickel alloy structural steel system has begun to be established. Hydraulic coal mining has begun to be promoted. The machinery industry can not only solve the technical problems of general machinery manufacturing, but also adopts and creates many advanced new technologies, trial-produces many new products, vigorously carries out design work, and develops large-scale and precision machinery manufacturing. The science and technology of the chemical industry has also made great progress, and significant achievements have been made in petrochemicals, polymer chemistry, and analytical chemistry, creating many new products. Other aspects of science and technology, such as transportation, construction, textile, light industry, and forestry industry, have also made many creative achievements. Agricultural science and technology, based on the experience of high-yield and high-yield farming by the broad masses of farmers, is entering new fields. In the medical field, there has also been new development in mastering modern medical technologies and sorting out the medical heritage of the motherland. In addition, a lot of research work has been done and great achievements have been made in the investigation, exploration, and comprehensive utilization of various natural resources, and in the theoretical research of basic disciplines.

While science and technology has made achievements, the science and technology contingent has also grown, and the political quality and scientific and technological level of this contingent have also been improved. A scientific and technological contingent guided by Marxism-Leninism and composed of worker-peasant innovators, young scientists and technicians, and veteran experts has begun to take shape.

The conference pointed out that the development of science and technology in the past three years, especially the Great Leap Forward in 1958, was achieved under the leadership of the Party, with the whole Party and the whole people vigorously engaging in science and developing the technical revolution, as a result of firmly implementing the mass line, and as a result of the broad masses emancipating their minds, breaking superstitions, exerting soaring enthusiasm, and carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. The conference believes that through the work of the past three years, we have initially found the path to develop science and technology in our country. And resolutely implementing the Party's absolute leadership over science and technology and implementing political command is the fundamental guarantee for advancing along this path. Continuing to advance along this path, the science and technology work in 1959 will surely achieve greater development.

The conference, based on the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the targets for the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1959, conducted a more in-depth discussion on the Draft Plan for the Development of Science and Technology in 1959. A number of key tasks have been initially determined in six major areas: emerging cutting-edge science and technology, industry and transportation, agriculture, medicine and health, transforming nature, and basic theory. While carrying out research work, we will also vigorously promote the popularization of scientific research achievements and advanced experiences.
Constantly Overcoming Difficulties and Constantly Achieving Victory
Unifying the Arrangement of National Science and Technology Work Forces and Plans -- Ensuring the Completion of Key Tasks While Developing Other Science and Technology Work -- Science and Technology Work is a Work of Exploring the Laws of Nature and Then Transforming Nature, Itself is a Process of Constantly Overcoming Difficulties.

Everyone believes that the draft plan for 1959 proposed by the conference is a Great Leap Forward plan, and relevant departments and localities should further study and supplement it, and after approval, it will become the outline for our Great Leap Forward in science and technology in 1959. In order to realize this task, we must unify the national science and technology work forces and plans and make correct arrangements. We must resolutely implement the Party's mass line, implement the central government's and local governments' simultaneous development of science and technology work, the simultaneous use of indigenous and foreign methods, the combination of popularization and improvement, the combination of research by professional institutions and scientific activities by the broad masses, and the combination of scientific research, teaching, and productive labor. We must make comprehensive arrangements for major and critical science and technology work nationwide; the forces of the central and local governments must be organized, divided into labor, and cooperated to jointly complete important tasks of national significance. Under the condition of ensuring the completion of national tasks, localities should, in conjunction with the needs, characteristics, and conditions of their regions, focus on arranging scientific and technological tasks that serve the industrial and agricultural production and construction of their regions, further formulate the scientific and technological development plans of their regions, and extensively carry out local scientific and technological work. In order to realize this year's Great Leap Forward in science and technology, the conference believes that all departments and localities must also widely carry out communist great collaboration.

The conference pointed out that in addition to focusing on solving the needs of the local national economic plan, localities should also actively develop scientific and technological work in all aspects. Focus and comprehensiveness should be well combined. The conference believes that all regions should adopt a positive attitude towards developing several emerging cutting-edge science and technology fields. Theoretical research work should be properly arranged. Theoretical work must be combined with practice and guide practice, and the tendency of being divorced from reality should be opposed. However, undervaluing theoretical research and simplifying the negation of the necessity of a certain theoretical research are also detrimental to the comprehensive and long-term development of science and technology. In the leadership work of science and technology, we must continue to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and take effective measures to actively carry out academic activities.

At the end of the conference, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen made a concluding speech to all the representatives. He said that it is not without difficulties to realize the leap forward plan for science and technology in 1959. Science and technology work is to explore the laws of nature and use these laws to transform nature, and it itself is a process of constantly overcoming difficulties. Through the efforts of the past few years, especially in 1958, some battles have developed in depth, and the problems have become clearer and clearer, which is a good thing. The more thoroughly we understand the difficulties, the more we can think of ways to deal with them, and by constantly overcoming difficulties, we will be able to achieve greater victories.

After explaining the arrangement of science and technology work, Nie Rongzhen said: The key to carrying out the work is that science and technology work must be under the leadership of the Party committee, and within the possible scope, it must be combined with the central tasks of the Party and with the mass-based Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. We must find out the key scientific and technical problems in the current Great Leap Forward in production, be good at discovering and raising these problems, rely on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, organize forces, take measures, and solve them, so as to guarantee and promote the great development of production from the scientific and technical point of view.

    从社会主义建设总任务出发　为经济建设和国防建设服务
    统筹全国力量发展科学技术
    地方要在保证“全国一盘棋”的原则下建立地区性的科学技术工作
    全国地方科学技术工作会议讨论了今年大跃进计划
    新华社上海15日电　1958年12月22日在上海召集的全国地方科学技术工作会议，已经在1月4日闭幕。会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神和六中全会提出的1959年工农业大跃进的指标，研究了目前科学技术工作的情况，讨论了1959年的科学技术发展计划（草案），并且交流了各部门、各地方科学技术工作的经验。
    这次会议是由国家科学技术委员会主持的。参加这次会议的有中央各部门和全国各省、市、自治区的科学技术领导干部二百八十余人。
    中共中央政治局委员、上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志和国务院副总理、国家科学技术委员会主任聂荣臻在会上作了报告。今年科学技术发展计划的要点
    继续加强几门新兴的尖端技术的工作——用大量的工作解决工农业生产建设中的科学技术问题，总结群众创造的经验——加强对医学的研究，包括对中医的理论研究和经验总结——发展基础学科的理论研究
    聂荣臻概括地叙述了我国科学技术发展的情况，指出了1959年的科学技术发展计划（草案）的要点。他说，今年要求继续加强几门新兴的尖端技术的工作；要求用大量的工作解决工农业生产建设中的科学技术问题，总结群众创造的经验；要求加强对医学的研究，包括对中医的理论研究和经验总结；要求发展基础学科的理论研究。在开展上述的工作同时，必须十分重视科学研究成果和先进经验的推广工作，特别对于1958年已经出现的许多新成果和先进经验应该采取措施，加以总结、鉴定，迅速运用到生产中去。在任务的安排上要抓住关键问题，加强薄弱环节和消灭空白部门，为当前急需和长远发展服务。
    接着，聂荣臻根据当前科学技术工作的情况和任务，指出了有关发展我国科学技术的方针、道路以及思想方法、工作作风的几个问题。他说，第一，科学技术工作必须从社会主义建设的总任务出发，为经济建设和国防建设服务。1959年科学技术发展计划的编订，就是从经济建设和国防建设的需要出发的。1959年科学技术工作做得怎么样，衡量的主要标准就是看科学技术工作能不能适应和促进经济建设和国防建设的发展。第二，为了实现今年的科学技术工作任务，必须统筹安排全国的力量，贯彻党的群众路线和中央地方分工协作的方针。地方要在保证“全国一盘棋”的原则下建立地区性的科学技术工作。第三，要改进科学技术工作者的思想方法与工作作风，把革命的热情和科学的态度结合起来，把领导水平提高一步。破除迷信对于发展科学是必要的，但是不应当借口破除迷信而否认科学真理。
    在会议期间，国家科学技术委员会副主任韩光对1959年科学技术发展计划草案作了说明，中央各有关部门和中国科学院的负责同志以及国家科学技术委员会的几位副主任分别就科学技术工作的各个方面，作了专题发言；省、市、自治区科学技术工作的领导干部也在会议上就科学技术工作作了发言。在会议期间，各地代表还分别举行了十多个专业座谈会。去年是科学技术大丰收的一年
    全党全民大办科学、大闹技术革命的新形势正在形成——科学技术水平有了显著的提高——由工农革新家、青年科学技术人员和老专家组成的科学技术队伍日益壮大
    会议回顾了过去三年来的工作。从1956年编制十二年科学技术发展远景规划起，三年来，我国的科学技术工作，在党的领导下，经过全体科学技术工作者和广大群众的努力，在苏联和其它兄弟国家的热情援助下，已经取得了许多巨大的成就。特别是整风运动和反右派斗争以来，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业全面大跃进形势的推动下，一扫过去少数人冷冷清清搞科学技术的局面，形成了全党全民大办科学、大闹技术革命的新形势，我国科学技术的面貌发生了很大的变化。
    三年来，我国的科学技术水平有了显著的提高。在几门新兴的尖端科学技术方面，有了迅速的发展。在工业科学技术方面，在努力掌握现代科学技术成就的同时，也作了不少创造性的工作，例如：冶金工业中高炉、平炉、电炉的利用系数，已经走入世界先进的行列；非铬镍的合金结构钢系统已开始建立。水力采煤已经开始推广。机械工业不仅可以解决一般机械制造的技术问题，还采用和创造了许多先进的新工艺，试制了许多新产品，大力开展设计的工作，发展大型和精密的机械制造。化学工业的科学技术也有很大发展，石油化学、高分子化学、分析化学等都取得了显著的成绩，创造了许多种新产品。其它交通运输、建筑、纺织、轻工、森林工业等各方面的科学技术也都有不少创造性的成就。农业科学技术在广大农民群众高额丰产经验的基础上，正在进入新的领域。在医学方面，对于现代医疗新技术的掌握和祖国医药遗产的整理，也有新的发展。此外，在对各种自然资源的调查、考察和综合利用，在基础学科的理论研究方面，都作了很多研究工作，有了很大成绩。
    在科学技术取得成就的同时，科学技术队伍也壮大了，这个队伍的政治质量和科学技术水平也有了提高。一支以马克思列宁主义思想为指导的、由工农革新家、青年科学技术人员和老专家所组成的科学技术队伍，已开始形成。
    会议指出，三年来科学技术的发展，特别是1958年的大跃进，是在党的领导下，全党全民大办科学、发展技术革命而取得的，是坚决贯彻群众路线的结果，是广大群众解放思想、破除迷信，发挥冲天干劲，发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格的结果。会议认为：通过三年来的工作，我们已初步找到了发展我国科学技术的道路。而坚决贯彻党对于科学技术的绝对领导，实行政治挂帅，是沿着这条道路前进的根本保证。继续沿着这条道路前进，1959年的科学技术工作，必将取得更大的发展。
    会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神和1959年工农业跃进指标，对于1959年科学技术发展计划（草案）进行了较深入的讨论。在新兴的尖端科学技术、工业交通、农业、医药卫生、改造自然和基础理论等六大方面，初步确定了一批重点任务。在开展研究工作的同时，还将大力进行科学研究成果和先进经验的推广工作。不断克服困难　不断获得胜利
    统一安排全国科学技术工作的力量和计划——保证重点任务的完成，同时发展其它的科学技术工作——科学技术工作是一个探索自然规律进而变革自然的工作，它本身就是一个不断克服困难的过程。
    大家认为，会议提出的1959年计划草案是个大跃进的计划，有关部门、地方应该进一步研究、补充，经批准后，就成为我们1959年科学技术大跃进的纲领。为了实现这个任务，必须把全国科学技术工作的力量和计划统一起来，加以正确安排。必须坚决贯彻党的群众路线，贯彻中央的与地方的科学技术工作同时并举、土洋并举、普及与提高相结合、专业机构的研究与广大群众的科学活动相结合，以及科学研究和教学及生产劳动相结合的方针。要在全国范围内，把重大的关键性科学技术工作，进行全面的安排；中央和地方的力量，要组织起来，分工协作，共同完成具有全国意义的重要任务。地方在保证完成全国任务的条件下，应结合本地区的需要、特点和条件，着重安排为本地区工农业生产建设服务的科学技术任务，进一步拟定本地区的科学技术发展计划，广泛开展地方的科学技术工作。为了实现今年科学技术的大跃进，会议认为，各部门、各地方还必须广泛开展共产主义的大协作。
    会议指出，地方除了着重解决本地区国民经济计划需要以外，还应该积极发展各方面的科学技术工作。重点和全面要很好结合。会议认为各地对发展几门新兴的尖端科学技术，应该采取积极的态度。对理论研究工作，要恰当安排。理论工作必须结合实际和指导实际，应当反对脱离实际的倾向。但是，轻视理论研究，简单化地否定某一门理论研究的必要，对科学技术的全面和长远的发展也是不利的。在科学技术的领导工作上，要继续贯彻百家争鸣的方针，采取有效措施，积极开展学术活动。
    在会议结束的时候，聂荣臻副总理向全体代表作了总结讲话。他说，实现1959年科学技术的跃进计划不是没有困难的。科学技术工作就是要探索自然的规律，运用这些规律来变革自然，它本身就是一个不断克服困难的过程。经过过去几年特别是1958年的努力，有些战斗向纵深发展了，问题越来越清楚了，这是一件好事。对困难越了解得透彻，就越能想办法去对付它，不断地克服困难，就能够不断地获得更大的胜利。
    在说明了科学技术工作的安排之后，聂荣臻说：开展工作的关键，是科学技术工作必须在党委领导下，在可能范围内努力和党的中心任务结合，和群众性的工农业生产大跃进结合。必须摸清当前生产大跃进中关键性的科学技术问题，善于发现和提出这些问题，依靠党的领导和群众的支持，组织力量，采取措施，加以解决，从科学技术上保证并促进生产的大发展。
