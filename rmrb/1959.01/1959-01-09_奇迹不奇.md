Miracle or Not
Wu Lü

    If someone asks: What is the use of pigs? Usually, the most standard answer is probably no more than: meat, for consumption; bristles, for making brushes; skin, for making leather; manure, for fertilizing fields. That's all. However, the news about the Tianjin No. 2 Food Factory published in this newspaper today and the news about the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant published in the previous period have added a long list of content besides meat for consumption, bristles for making brushes, skin for making leather, and manure for fertilizing fields: by-products and waste can be used to extract cerebrosides and dozens of other medicines and chemical reagents, manure can be used for biogas power generation, and it can also be used to extract vitamin B12, a specific drug for treating pernicious anemia...

    A pig that used to mainly provide meat now has so many uses; a common slaughterhouse has become a joint enterprise that can produce medicine, chemical reagents, and generate electricity! People say: This is a miracle. Yes, it is a miracle. Who would have thought that a slaughterhouse that has always been just "pigs in, meat out" could come up with so many tricks? However, on closer thought, this miracle is not so miraculous. Why can cerebrosides be extracted from pig spinal cord? Why can vitamin B12 be extracted from pig manure? Do the workers of Tianjin No. 2 Food Factory and Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant really have any special skills that others don't? Of course not. Extracting cerebrosides from pig spinal cord and extracting vitamin B12 from pig manure is just like extracting oil from oil shale and extracting starch from corn. It is that people have discovered the inherent functions of the substances themselves, rather than people injecting new functions into the original substances. All things in the world may have endless functions, and people can discover and utilize them; but they cannot force a certain substance to produce a function that it cannot have. Pig manure and vitamin B12 seem to be unrelated; but pig manure contains vitamin B12, so people can extract it. Pig manure does not contain iron, so people can never extract pig iron from pig manure. In this way, extracting vitamin B12 from pig manure, although it is an unheard-of miracle, is completely scientific and in line with objective laws, and therefore not surprising.

    However, why is it that Tianjin No. 2 Food Factory extracted vitamin B12 from pig manure? Why is it that Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Plant had ideas about pigs and set up a series of satellite factories? This leads to the discussion of people's subjective initiative. Pig spinal cord contains cerebrosides, and pig manure contains vitamin B12, which has always been the case. But due to various reasons, people may not be able to discover and utilize it at the beginning. When it is possible to discover and utilize it, not everyone is willing to explore its secrets; even if others have unlocked these secrets, not everyone is willing to learn. Those who are bound by conventions are timid about all new attempts. The cadres, workers, and technicians of Tianjin No. 2 Food Factory and Wuhan Meat Processing Plant dared to create, were diligent in learning, promoted the style of daring to think and dare to act, and humbly learned from other people's experiences, so that they found out the inherent uses of various pig by-products and waste. If it were not for this style of daring to think and daring to act and the pragmatic scientific attitude, and the promotion of people's subjective initiative, even if pig spinal cord could extract cerebrosides and pig manure could extract vitamin B12, they would still not be able to utilize it.

    The mysteries of nature are endless. Many substances in the world have multiple uses. This is the case with pigs, wood, coal, and salt. This is what we already know; as for what we don't know, we don't know how much more there is. Utilizing the multiple uses of these substances, and discovering new uses that we don't know now, and truly making the best use of everything, will surely provide more material wealth for my country's socialist construction. The comprehensive utilization of pigs is just a small example. Unfortunately, we have not yet utilized the multiple uses of many substances.

    奇迹不奇
    吴滤
    如果有人问：猪有什么用处？通常，最标准的答案恐怕也不过是：肉，可食；鬃，可制刷；皮，可制革；粪，可肥田。如此而已。然而，今天本报发表的天津食品二厂的新闻和前一个时期发表的武汉肉类联合加工厂的新闻，却在肉可食、鬃可制刷、皮可制革、粪可肥田之外，加上了一长串的内容：副废品可提取脑磷脂等几十种药品和化学试剂，粪可用于沼气发电，还可提取治疗恶性贫血病的特效药维生素B12……。
    一头过去主要是提供肉食的猪，现在有这样多的用途；一个普普通通的屠宰场，变成了能制药、能制化学试剂、能发电的联合企业！人们说：这是奇迹。是的，这是奇迹。谁曾想到历来只是“进猪出肉”的屠宰场会变出这么多的花样来？然而，仔细想来，这奇迹却也不奇。为什么从猪脊髓中能提取脑磷脂？为什么从猪粪中能提取维生素B12？难道天津食品二厂和武汉肉类联合加工厂的工人真有什么别人没有的特殊本领吗？当然不是的。从猪脊髓中提取脑磷脂，从猪粪中提取维生素B12，正如同从油母页岩中提取石油、从玉米中提取淀粉一样，是人们发现了物质本身固有的功能，而不是人们把新的功能注射到原来的物质中去。世间万物都可能具有无穷无尽的功能，人们可以发现它、利用它；却可不能强使某一种物质产生它不可能有的功能。猪粪和维生素B12，看来是毫不相关的；但猪粪却含有维生素B12的成分，因而人们才能够把它提取出来。猪粪并不含有铁的成分，因而人们总不可能从猪粪中提取出生铁来。这样看来，从猪粪中提取维生素B12，虽是闻所未闻的奇迹，但却是完全科学的，合乎客观规律的，因而也并不奇怪。
    然而，为什么是天津食品二厂从猪粪中提取出维生素B12？为什么是武汉肉类联合加工厂从猪身上打主意，办了一系列的卫星工厂呢？这就要谈到人的主观能动性了。猪脊髓中有脑磷脂，猪粪中有维生素B12，自古皆然。但由于种种原因，人们在一开始的时候还不可能发现它，利用它。到了有可能发现它、利用它的时候，也不是人人都愿意去探索它的秘密的；甚至别人解开了这些秘密，也不是人人都乐意去学习的。束缚于陈规的人就胆怯于一切新的尝试。天津食品二厂和武汉肉类加工厂的干部工人和技术人员敢于创造，勤于学习，发扬了敢想敢干的风格，虚心学习别人的经验，才找出了多种猪的副废品本来固有的用途。如果不是有了这种敢想敢干的风格和实事求是的科学态度，发扬了人的主观能动性，尽管猪脊髓能够提取脑磷脂，猪粪能够提取维生素B12，他们还是不能去利用它的。
    自然界的奥秘无穷无尽。世上许多物质都具有多种用途。猪是如此，木材是如此，煤炭是如此，盐也是如此。这还是我们已知道的；至于不知道的更不知有多少。利用这些物质的多种用途，并且发现我们现在还不知道的新的用途，真正做到物尽其用，必能给我国的社会主义建设提供更多的物质财富。猪的综合利用不过是小小一例。可惜，许多种物质的多种用途，我们现在还没有利用起来。
