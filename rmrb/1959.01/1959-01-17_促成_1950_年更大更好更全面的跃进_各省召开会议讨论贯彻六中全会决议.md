Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 16th: The Second Meeting of the First Hebei Provincial Congress of Communist Party Members was held in Tianjin from December 29th of last year to January 9th of this year.

    The meeting determined: To organize inspection teams of about 10,000 people from the province to the county level, led by the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels, and adopt the mass line method to carry out a large-scale and vigorous mass movement to rectify the people's communes, so as to comprehensively consolidate and greatly improve the rural people's communes. The rectification period will be approximately four months (from January to April). In the rectification work, it is necessary to first conduct thorough socialist and communist ideological education for the commune members. On the basis of raising ideology, comprehensively implement the various policies of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee regarding the people's communes, arrange the production of the communes, and organize and mobilize the masses to launch a high tide of industrial and agricultural production in the winter and spring seasons.

    The meeting pointed out that 1959 is a crucial year in the three years of hard struggle. On the basis of the great victory in 1958, we must greatly advance all economic construction undertakings. We should carefully summarize and promote the experience of the province's comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in 1958. To this end, we must adhere to putting politics in command; we must resolutely implement the Party's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, as well as a whole set of policies of walking on two legs; we must resolutely implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward," and abide by the laws of planned and proportionate development; according to the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," strengthen the unified leadership of the Party, strengthen the unified planning of various undertakings, and establish the overall view that the part must be subordinate to and serve the whole; in all work, we must adhere to the working method of the mass line; in any work, we must adhere to the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit. In order to ensure the healthy and smooth development of the work in 1959, all Party members must tirelessly strengthen their study, vigorously study theory, and conscientiously summarize practical experience.
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 16th: The Hunan Provincial Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee from December 21st to 26th of last year.

    The meeting preliminarily formulated the main targets for industrial and agricultural production in the province for 1959 in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session. The meeting held that the province's plan for developing the national economy in 1959 is a leap forward plan, and Party committees at all levels and the people of the province must continue to exert their efforts, strive for advancement, and complete and overfulfill the various tasks for 1959.

    The meeting particularly emphasized that we must immediately get to work, closely integrate with production, and carry out a focused and step-by-step rectification and consolidation of the province's more than 1,100 people's communes. In the work of rectifying and consolidating the communes, we must boldly mobilize the masses, conscientiously summarize the great victories achieved in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the socialist ideological education movement in 1958, and further carry out the socialist and communist ideological education movement. The meeting also decided to draw a group of county party secretary-level cadres from provincial-level organs to go to the people's communes to conduct pilot rectification work, create experience, and promote it throughout the province in a timely manner.

    After the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, the local Party committees convened meetings of the Party secretaries of the People's Communes, thoroughly implementing the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and arranging work in light of the specific circumstances of the local areas in accordance with the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee.
Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 16th: The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a plenary committee (enlarged) meeting. The meeting focused on discussing the rectification and consolidation of rural people's communes, and passed a decision and instructions on this issue. The meeting also studied the province's various plans for 1959 and arranged production for the first quarter in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session resolution.

    The meeting held that the current important task is to thoroughly study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, summarize the existing rich experience at all levels, further inspire the enthusiasm of cadres and masses, improve work, improve style, and better complete this year's greater tasks.

    The meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session resolution, discussed in detail the current production and rectification of the people's communes. It pointed out that the method of rectifying the communes is to take socialist and communist education as the key link, closely integrate with production, the first step is to train cadres intensively, summarize experience, and at the same time seize the opportunity to solve the current urgent problems, such as income distribution, winter production, etc.; the second step is to solve the general problems existing in the communes and establish systems; the third step is to rectify the organization and rectify the work style; the fourth step is to formulate production plans.

    The meeting pointed out that production plans should be based on a positive and reliable spirit, continue to exert full effort, oppose right-leaning conservatism, and at the same time strive for practicality, and combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit. Production plans should include both self-sufficient production and commodity production. The rectification work requires focusing on intensive training of cadres and conducting pilot projects before the Spring Festival, with the entire work basically completed by the end of March and the final touches completed in the first half of April. To this end, the provincial, district (autonomous prefecture, city) Party committees decided to dispatch a large number of cadres to form inspection teams to help rectify the communes, further mobilize the masses, and launch a winter production campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer and water conservancy.

    This meeting was held from December 22, 1958, to January 7 this year.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 16th: The enlarged plenary meeting of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded on the 10th. This was a meeting to summarize the work of 1958 based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and also a mobilization meeting for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    The meeting held that Qinghai Province has achieved unprecedentedly great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past year. The entire agricultural area and most of the pastoral area have realized the people's commune system; agricultural production has achieved a Great Leap Forward, basically solving the grain problem based on the existing population; under the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, Qinghai Province has gone from not producing any iron to having steel and iron produced in the province, and some factories in the machinery industry that originally belonged to repair and assembly have manufactured equipment for metallurgy, electricity, and mining through mutual cooperation. Other industries such as coal, transportation, etc. have also made great progress.

    The meeting formulated a development plan for various undertakings this year based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and decided to continue to implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward," vigorously develop steel, machinery, coal, and other related industries, and required the entire Party and the entire people to develop the province's light industry with greater strength to adapt to the needs of the large increase in population and the increasing improvement of people's living standards. At the same time, in order to prepare for a larger-scale construction of Qinghai and development of Qinghai's abundant resources, and to fundamentally solve the grain problem after the population increases, the meeting particularly emphasized that it is necessary to develop agricultural production with great strength. In pastoral areas, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and feed, it is necessary to plan to reclaim large areas of wasteland and expand the area of cultivated land.

    The meeting decided that the tasks for the first quarter of this year will focus on rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. This work is required to be completed before the end of April. In the work of rectifying the people's communes, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life, and deeply publicize the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes" so that everyone knows it. In the work of rectifying the people's communes, we must always combine with production, starting from production and ending with production. On the one hand, rectify the organization, establish and improve systems, solve urgent problems, and formulate this year's plans and long-term plans; on the other hand, continue to mobilize the masses to vigorously build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, reform and manufacture tools, and do all the preparations for spring plowing.

    The meeting held that in the new year, in order to achieve greater achievements and accelerate socialist construction, it is also necessary to continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, exert greater revolutionary effort, and promote a down-to-earth work style and scientific spirit.

    This meeting began on December 15, 1958.
