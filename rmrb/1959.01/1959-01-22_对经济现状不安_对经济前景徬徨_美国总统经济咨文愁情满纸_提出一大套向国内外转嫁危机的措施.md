Xinhua News Agency, January 21st, Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower presented his annual economic message to Congress on the 20th. This message reviewed the U.S. economic situation over the past year and looked forward to the U.S. economic prospects for the coming year. The message fully reflects the U.S. authorities' anxiety about the U.S. economic situation and lack of confidence in the outlook, given the deepening economic crisis.

Eisenhower devoted considerable space in his message to discussing the U.S. economic crisis. He said that in 1958, the U.S. experienced a "sharp recession in business," which was "more acute than the recession of 1953-1954," and "its impact was not limited to the United States alone." He said that in 1953-1954, investment in the construction of new industrial enterprises and the purchase of new equipment in the U.S. decreased by 11%, while in 1957-1958 it decreased by 22%. In 1953, U.S. automobile production decreased by 11%, while in 1957-1958 it decreased by 47%. In addition, steel production in 1957-1958 decreased by 40%, and the production of machine tools and other equipment decreased by 21%. The production of durable consumer goods decreased by 27% from July 1957 to April 1958. Eisenhower admitted that the U.S. suffered a typical crisis of overproduction in 1957-1958. He said, "Prior to the recession of 1957-1958, there had been a considerable increase in productive capacity, but the demand did not increase correspondingly."

When talking about the economic outlook, Eisenhower tried to convince the American people that the deep economic crisis seemed to be "passing." He said that the U.S. is currently moving towards "new high levels of production and employment." He also said that the annual rate of the U.S. gross national product in the fourth quarter of last year reached $453 billion. He therefore said, "With the beginning of 1959, there is reason to believe that business activity will continue to improve in the coming years." However, even as Eisenhower was saying this, he had to point out that the annual rate of gross national product reached in the fourth quarter of last year did not reach "the peak before the recession," and the unemployment situation in December of last year was "above normal." In particular, when Eisenhower was saying these words, he completely avoided the important fact that although the U.S. industrial production index has gradually rebounded since May of last year, this rebound was achieved after the government used a large amount of spending, even at the cost of plunging fiscal finance into a deep crisis. Moreover, the situation of fixed capital investment continues to deteriorate, which shows that the U.S. economic crisis will never "pass" as easily as Eisenhower boasted.

In his message, Eisenhower expressed concern about one of the phenomena of the deepening U.S. economic crisis—serious inflation. He said: Rising prices are "harming America's economic health" because it "increasingly limits the market domestically and at the same time damages our competitiveness in foreign markets." Eisenhower called for a "war" on inflation. But he made it clear that the spearhead of this "relentless war" will first point to the American working people. He specifically asked the union to abandon the struggle to raise wages and asked the union to have "restraint" in collective bargaining.

Eisenhower put forward measures to shift the crisis at home and abroad. He talked about the main "means" by which the U.S. government fights the economic crisis: increasing government spending and providing military orders to U.S. monopoly capital. In addition, the U.S. government has also taken some measures such as preferential loans, extending the period for the payment of unemployment benefits, and maintaining high taxes. Eisenhower said that in the future, the "combined expenditures of federal, state, and local government agencies will continue to increase," and he called on U.S. companies to "immediately end" the situation of reducing purchases due to overproduction.

Eisenhower also proposed a plan to shift the crisis abroad, especially to Latin America, Africa, and Asia. He demanded that the United States strengthen foreign dumping and capital expansion. He said that expanding loan authorizations provided by the Export-Import Bank "will promote U.S. exports," and "financing" the "economic development" of vast areas of Latin America, Africa, and Asia is a task "of very large scale and very urgent nature." He also called for extending the legislation dealing with "surplus" agricultural products to strengthen the dumping of "surplus" agricultural products abroad, and suggested that the United States increase its funds in the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to strengthen capital exports.

    对经济现状不安　对经济前景徬徨
    美国总统经济咨文愁情满纸
    提出一大套向国内外转嫁危机的措施
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔20日向国会提出一年一度的经济咨文。这个咨文回顾了过去一年美国的经济情况，并且瞻望今后一年的美国经济前景。这个咨文充分反映了美国当局在经济危机深入发展的情况下，对美国经济现状的不安和对前景的没有信心。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文里用很大篇幅谈到了美国经济危机。他说，在1958年，美国经历了“企业上的急剧衰退”，比“1953—1954年的衰退要尖锐”，而且“它的影响不仅限于美国一国”。他说，在1953—1954年，美国在建设新工业企业和购买新设备方面的投资减少了11％，而1957—1958年却减少了22％。在1953年，美国的汽车生产减少了11％，而1957—1958年却减少了47％。此外，1957—1958年的钢产量下降了40％，机床和其他设备的产量下降了21％。耐用消费品产量自1957年7月到1958年4月减少了27％。艾森豪威尔承认，美国在1957—1958年所遭到的是典型的生产过剩危机。他说，“在1957—1958年的衰退以前，生产能力有过相当大的增长，但是需求量却没有相应的增加。”
    在谈到经济前景时，艾森豪威尔力图使美国人民相信，深重的经济危机似乎就将“过去”。他说，美国目前正向着“生产和就业新的高度的水平前进”。他还说，美国在去年第四季度国民总产值的年率达到四千五百三十亿美元。他因而说，“随着1959年的开始，有理由相信今后几年的商业活动将继续改善”。但是，就在艾森豪威尔这样谈的时候，他也不得不指出，去年第四季度达到的国民总产值年率并没有达到“衰退以前的最高峰”，去年12月的失业状况是“超过正常数字的”。尤其是，当艾森豪威尔在讲这些话的时候，根本回避了这样一个重要的事实：虽然从去年5月以来美国的工业生产指数在逐渐回升，这种回升却是在政府用大量开支、甚至不惜使财政金融陷入深刻的危机之后取得的。而且，固定资本投资的情况在继续恶化，这些都说明了，美国的经济危机决不会像艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的那样容易“过去”。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文里对美国经济危机深入发展的现象之一——严重的通货膨胀表示不安。他说：物价上涨在“危害美国的经济健康”，因为它“在国内使市场日益有限，同时又损害我们在国外市场的竞争能力”。艾森豪威尔要求对通货膨胀“宣战”。但是他表明，这场“无情的战争”的矛头将首先指向美国劳动人民。他特别要求工会放弃争取提高工资的斗争，要工会在集体谈判时有“节制”。
    艾森豪威尔提出了在国内外转嫁危机的措施，他谈到美国政府同经济危机进行斗争的主要“手段”是增加政府开支、向美国垄断资本提供军事订货。此外，美国政府还采取优惠贷款、延长失业补助金的发放期限以及维持高额税款等一些措施。艾森豪威尔说，今后美国“联邦、州和地方政府机构的联合开支将继续增加”，他并且呼吁美国企业“应当马上结束”由于生产过剩而减少进货的情况。
    艾森豪威尔还提出一个对外、特别是对拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲转嫁危机的计划。他要求美国要加强对外倾销和资本扩张。他说，对进出口银行提供的扩大贷款授权“将促进美国的输出”，“资助”拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲广大地区的“经济发展”这一工作“具有非常大的规模和非常紧迫的性质”。他还要求延长处理“剩余”农产品的立法以加强对外倾销“剩余”农产品，并且建议美国增加在国际货币基金组织和国际复兴开发银行的基金，以加强资本输出。
