　　Taming Rivers and Transforming Nature
　　People of Eight Counties and One City, Including Nandan, Build the Long River Water Conservancy Project

　　This newspaper reports: Conquering the Long River! Transforming the Long River! This is another earth-shattering feat of the people of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward.

　　The Long River damming project, including two large dams and 1,150 kilometers of main and branch canals, is of unprecedented scale in the history of Guangxi. It is also the largest project in the autonomous region's 1959 water conservancy plan. According to the plan, the entire project's water storage will irrigate 2.5 million mu of farmland in eight counties (Nandan, Hechi, Yishan, Xincheng, Liujiang, Liucheng, Laibin, and Shilong) and the suburbs of Liuzhou City, generate 30,000 kilowatts of electricity, and provide 250 kilometers of navigable waterways (part of the main canal) for ships of 200 tons or more. After the completion of the project, it will completely eliminate drought in this area, spread power grids everywhere, provide convenient water transportation, double agricultural production, and promote unprecedented industrial and commercial prosperity, further changing the backward economic outlook and greatly improving the people's lives.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, who are building socialism by leaps and bounds, have invested in this great construction with great enthusiasm. The dam construction project in Lalang Township, Yishan, on the Long River broke ground on August 13 last year. The Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic minority workers in the eight counties and one city in the beneficiary area actively participated in the work with soaring enthusiasm. Over the past few months, significant progress has been made in cleaning the dam site and preparing materials. Currently, 526 tons of indigenous explosives, more than 15,000 tons of indigenous cement of varying grades, and more than 1,700 wooden rail cars have been produced using indigenous methods. Various machines such as indigenous rock drills, cranes, and pedal-powered sawing machines have also been created, increasing work efficiency by tenfold or even fiftyfold. The broad masses of people in the rear are also fully supporting this construction site. At present, large-scale construction has begun.

　　The Long River originates in Guizhou and is 391 kilometers long, flowing through six counties including Nandan and Hechi in Guangxi. The total drainage area is 1,660 square kilometers. The lowest flow rate of this river is 16 cubic meters per second, and the water flows all year round, but due to the high terrain along the river, it is impossible to draw water for irrigation, and the vast farmland suffers from disasters year after year. For many years, people have wanted to utilize it, but because the mountains are high and the ridges are steep, requiring cutting through mountains and ridges and tunneling, the project is huge and impossible to do. Some people felt that it was simply impossible to subdue this rushing and roaring river. However, after liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the masses were actively organized and mobilized to break the superstitious ideas of fearing difficulties. After careful investigation and survey, a grand plan to conquer and transform the Long River was formulated. Now, the vast number of workers are cutting through mountains and ridges and tunneling. In the near future, the new Long River will be tamed to serve industrial and agricultural production and transportation.

### 驯服江河　改造自然  南丹等八县一市人民兴修龙江河水利

    驯服江河　改造自然
    南丹等八县一市人民兴修龙江河水利
    本报讯　征服龙江河！改造龙江河！是广西僮族自治区人民在全面大跃进中又一惊天动地的壮举。
    包括两座拦河大坝、一千一百五十公里干支渠道的龙江河拦河工程，规模之大，在广西的历史上是从来没有的。同时也是全自治区1959年度兴修水利规划中最大的一个工程。按照计划，全部工程的蓄水将灌溉南丹、河池、宜山、忻城、柳江、柳城、来宾、石龙八个县和柳州市郊区的二百五十万亩农田，发电三万瓩，还有可通行二百吨以上船只的航道（干渠的一部分）二百五十公里。工程建成之后，将使这一带地区全面消灭旱灾，电网遍布，水运四通八达，农业生产倍增，工商业空前繁荣，将进一步改变落后的经济面貌，人民生活将大大提高。
    在党的领导下，大踏步建设社会主义的广西僮族自治区各族人民，以高度热情投入这一伟大建设。龙江河宜山拉浪乡筑坝工程，于去年8月13日破土兴工。受益区八县一市的僮、汉等各族民工都踊跃出工，干劲冲天。几个月来，坝首清基和备料工作已取得了显著成绩。现已用土法制成土炸药五百二十六吨、高低标号土水泥一万五千多吨、木轨车一千七百多辆，还创造了土凿岩机、起重机、脚踏锯木机等多种机械，工效以十倍五十倍的速度提高。后方广大人民也在全力支援这个工地。目前，大规模施工已经开始。
    龙江河，发源于贵州，全长三百九十一公里，流经广西南丹、河池等六个县，全流域总面积共一千六百六十平方公里。这条河的最枯流量为十六秒公方，终年流水滔滔，但由于沿河地势较高，无法取水灌溉，广大农田常年受害。多少年来，人们就想利用它，但因山高岭陡，需要劈山削岭，凿隧洞，工程浩大，无法办到。有些人对这条奔腾咆哮的河流，简直感到难以使它就范。但是解放后，在党的领导下，积极组织发动群众，破除畏惧困难的迷信思想，并经过缜密察勘，制定出征服龙江河、改造龙江河的雄伟规划。现在广大民工正在劈山削岭，开凿隧洞，不久的将来，新的龙江河就会驯服地为工农业生产和交通运输服务。
