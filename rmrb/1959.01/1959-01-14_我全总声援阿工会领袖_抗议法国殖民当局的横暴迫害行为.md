    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on January 9th to the President of the Military Tribunal of Algiers in France, protesting the French colonial authorities' unwarranted arrest and trial of Algerian trade union leaders. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the General Union of Algerian Workers expressing support.
    
    In its protest telegram to the Military Tribunal of Algiers, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated that this brutal act demonstrates that the de Gaulle military dictatorship is leading France towards fascism.
    
    The protest telegram said: "These actions of yours have been met with strong condemnation and opposition from peace-loving and just people all over the world."
    
    The protest telegram said: "We firmly protest against your criminal acts and demand that you immediately release the Algerian trade union leaders and all patriots detained in France and Algeria. The French government should recognize national independence as the sacred and inviolable right of the Algerian people and immediately cease its dirty colonial war against Algeria."
    
    In its telegram of support to the General Union of Algerian Workers, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated that Algerian workers have made and are continuing to make tremendous contributions and sacrifices in the struggle for national independence. The telegram said: "Your struggle not only strengthens the entire Algerian national independence movement but also greatly contributes to the struggle of people all over the world to end the colonialist system. We firmly believe that no force can stop the Algerian people from achieving the final victory of national independence."
    
    The French colonial authorities had announced that they would try Abdelkader Issat, Secretary-General of the General Union of Algerian Workers, and other Algerian trade union leaders on January 12th. Currently, leaders of various Algerian trade unions are subjected to cruel persecution, and the workers' movement and the workers' legitimate rights have been subjected to savage suppression by the French colonial authorities.

    我全总声援阿工会领袖
    抗议法国殖民当局的横暴迫害行为
    新华社13日讯　中华全国总工会一月九日打电报给法国的阿尔及尔军事法庭庭长，抗议法国殖民当局无理逮捕和审讯阿尔及利亚工会领袖。同时还打电报给阿尔及利亚工人总联合会表示声援。
    中华全国总工会在给阿尔及尔军事法庭的抗议电中说，这种横暴行为说明了戴高乐军事独裁政权把法国引向法西斯化。
    抗议电说：“你们这些行为已遭到全世界爱好和平与正义人民强烈的谴责与反对。”
    抗议电说：“我们坚决抗议你们这种罪恶行为，要求你们立即释放被拘在法国和阿尔及利亚的阿尔及利亚工会领袖和一切爱国者。法国政府应该承认民族独立是阿尔及利亚人民神圣不可侵犯的权利，立即停止对阿尔及利亚肮脏的殖民战争。”
    中华全国总工会在给阿尔及利亚工人总联合会的声援电中说，阿尔及利亚工人在争取民族独立的斗争中曾经并且正在继续作出巨大的贡献和牺牲。电报说：“你们的斗争不仅加强着阿尔及利亚的整个民族独立运动，也大大有助于全世界人民结束殖民主义制度的斗争。我们深信没有任何力量能够阻挡阿尔及利亚人民取得民族独立的最后胜利。”
    法国殖民当局曾经宣布，要在一月十二日审判阿尔及利亚工人总联合会总书记埃德尔·伊萨特以及其他阿尔及利亚的工会领袖。目前，阿尔及利亚各工会的领袖都遭到残酷的迫害，工人运动和工人的正当权利一直受法国殖民当局的野蛮镇压。
