Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Medium Plate Mill, which produces large quantities of medium and thick steel plates, have made a successful start in realizing their greater leap forward plan for this year. On the afternoon of January 27th, they comprehensively overfulfilled the January production plan four days ahead of schedule.

The January production task of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Medium Plate Mill this year was very arduous. In particular, the amount of small-specification steel plates that are difficult to roll increased greatly, and the requirements for variety and quality were quite strict. They worked practically, diligently, and cleverly. Since the New Year, new production records have continued to emerge throughout the plant. Finally, on the afternoon of the 27th, they completed the January steel plate output plan ahead of schedule, achieving 100% production according to the planned varieties, completing the quality indicators for steel plates, and realizing an all-round leap forward.

In January, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Medium Plate Mill closely combined boosting morale with grasping measures. In order to promote the hard-working spirit of the workers, at the end of last December, they proposed a greater leap forward production task for 1959 to all employees, and mobilized the employees to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 through vigorous airing of views, and formulated a greater leap forward plan for 1959. At the same time, the factory leaders guided the workers to carry out technical revolution on a large scale, trying every possible means to break through weak links. At the beginning of this year, the weak links in the plant's production were unstable quality and low output of small-specification steel plates. According to the requirements of "high output, high quality, and many varieties," the factory leaders mobilized the workers to concentrate their efforts to break through this weak link. A series of technical measures were taken on the rolling mill, such as forced reduction, strengthening maintenance and repair, rapid motor replacement, and roll changes. A "five-fast" competition was launched, including fast rolling, fast heating, fast shearing, fast inspection, and fast roll changing. This quickly solved the technical key problems such as roll movement and frame shaking in rolling small-specification steel plates, greatly improving production efficiency and product quality, and creating conditions for comprehensively overfulfilling the January production plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th: With vigorous fighting spirit, the workers of the First Rolling Mill Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Shanghai's largest rolling mill workshop, have created twenty-three consecutive new steel rolling records in the first twenty-eight days of this year, completing the January production plan five days ahead of schedule. As of the 28th, the steel produced by this workshop has exceeded the monthly plan by 10%, which is 1,405 tons more than the highest monthly output in December of last year, creating the highest record since the factory was built, and firing the first shot for realizing a greater leap forward plan for the whole year.

At the beginning of the New Year, the workers in this workshop launched a heated competition between shifts to learn from and catch up with the advanced, under the slogan of seizing every second and rolling steel quickly. On the 7th, after the workers of Shift A had just created a new record of rolling 822 light rails, the workers of Shift B immediately raised the new record to 831, and also created a new record of rolling 1,676 steel billets. Immediately afterwards, the workers of Shift C broke the records of Shifts A and B and jumped to first place. At the most heated moment of the competition, a new atmosphere of creating five new records in one day appeared in the entire workshop.

In this new wave of production, the workers promoted the communist spirit and strengthened mutual cooperation. In addition to completing their production tasks, each shift actively prepared for the next shift's production work. On the 26th, after completing their task, the workers of Shift A squeezed out time to replace the rolls on the rolling mill to help Shift B prepare. The workers of Shift A also reduced the roll changing time from the planned two and a half hours to one hour and sixteen minutes. As a result, on this day, the workers of Shift B created a new record of rolling 976 flat billets.

    块块钢坯成好材
    鞍钢第一中板厂提前完成全月任务
    上钢三厂连创二十三次轧钢新纪录
    据新华社鞍山30日电　大量生产中厚钢板的鞍钢第一中板厂的职工们，在实现今年更大的跃进计划中旗开得胜，1月27日下午提前四天全面超额完成1月份生产计划。
    鞍钢第一中板厂今年1月份生产任务很艰巨，特别是难轧的小规格钢板大大增加，而且品种、质量要求相当严格。他们实干、苦干和巧干，新年以后，全厂新的生产纪录不断出现，终于在27日下午提前完成1月份钢板产量计划，做到百分之百按计划品种生产，并且完成了钢板的质量指标，实现了全面跃进。
    鞍钢第一中板厂1月份把鼓干劲和抓措施紧密结合起来。为了发扬职工们的苦干精神，早在去年12月底就向全体职工提出了1959年更大跃进的生产任务，并且发动职工通过大鸣大放的办法，总结1958年大跃进的经验，制订了1959年更大的跃进计划。同时，工厂领导上又引导职工大搞技术革命，千方百计突破薄弱环节。今年年初全厂生产薄弱环节，是小规格钢板质量不稳定、产量很低。根据“高产量高质量多品种”的要求，厂的领导发动职工集中力量突破这一薄弱环节，在轧钢机上采取了强行压下、加强维护检修、快速换马达和换轧辊等一系列技术措施，开展了快轧、快烧、快剪、快检修、快换辊的“五快”竞赛，从而迅速地解决了轧制小规格钢板轧辊串动和机架摇动等技术关键问题，大大提高了生产效率和产品质量，为全面超额完成1月份生产计划创造了条件。
    据新华社上海30日电　上海最大的轧钢车间——上海第三钢铁厂第一轧钢车间的职工以旺盛的斗志在今年的前二十八天中，连续创造二十三次轧钢新纪录，提前五天完成1月份生产计划。到28日为止，这个车间轧成的钢材已经超过月度计划10％，比去年月产量最高的12月份还多出一千四百零五吨，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录，为实现全年更大的跃进计划打响了第一炮。
    这个车间的职工们今年新年一开始，就在分秒必争、快速轧钢的口号下展开了班与班之间学先进、赶先进的热烈竞赛。7日，当甲班工人刚创造了轧制轻轨八百二十二根的新纪录以后，乙班工人马上把新纪录提高到八百三十一根，同时还创造了轧制钢坯一千六百七十六根的新纪录。紧接着，丙班工人又刷新了甲、乙两班的纪录，跃居第一。在竞赛最热烈的时候，全车间曾出现了一天五创新纪录的新气象。
    在这个新的生产热潮里，工人们发扬了共产主义精神，加强相互间的协作。各班除了完成生产任务以外，都积极为下一班做好生产准备工作。26日，甲班工人在完成任务以后，挤出时间调换轧钢机上的轧辊，帮助乙班做准备。甲班工人还把换辊子的时间由计划二个半小时压缩到一小时十六分。结果，在这一天乙班工人创造了轧制扁坯九百七十六根的新纪录。
