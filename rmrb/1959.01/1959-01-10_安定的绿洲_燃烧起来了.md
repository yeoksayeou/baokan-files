    "The Oasis of Stability" is Burning
    Commentator of this newspaper

    At the very beginning of the new year, a mass struggle against colonial rule broke out in Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo. Because the colonial authorities unreasonably prohibited a political gathering of the Congolese people demanding independence, and the protest demonstrations held by the masses were bloodily suppressed, the Congolese people could no longer endure it and took up arms to fire on the colonialists. This struggle lasted for several days. The Belgian colonial authorities panicked and dispatched troops and police to carry out armed suppression overnight. The death toll of African residents in the Congo has reached 175, with hundreds injured. At present, although large-scale mass resistance actions have been suppressed in Léopoldville, mass resistance actions against colonial rule continue to rise and fall in Kimuenza and Kasan-guru near the city, and in Thysville a little further away.

    In the past, Belgian colonialists often blocked news about the struggle of the Congolese people. However, this struggle broke out in the capital of the Congo, and it seems that it cannot be blocked. Therefore, the Belgian colonialists tried their best to distort the truth of the incident, describing this struggle as a "riot" of some "unemployed masses." However, this statement by the Belgian colonialists is obviously unable to deceive anyone, and even the American and British bourgeois newspapers admit that this is not an ordinary event, but a struggle against colonial rule. "The New York Times" could not hide its panic, and shouted to prevent the Belgian Congo from becoming "another Algeria." The "Times" commented on January 7: "Europeans elsewhere will also feel uneasy, because they have always regarded the Belgian Congo as the only stable oasis on an increasingly eventful continent. And African nationalists will be encouraged, because they will think that this riot shows that a powerful liberation movement has finally begun in the Congo."

    The struggle of the Congolese people is an accusation against the suffering they have endured for a long time, and an outbreak of the anger that has accumulated in their hearts for many years. Since the 18th century, hundreds of thousands of Congolese blacks have been trafficked to the Americas and other places. During the reign of King Leopold II of Belgium in the Belgian Congo, nearly ten million innocent residents were killed. The colonialists' whips and bayonets forced workers and peasants to engage in hard and unpaid labor. Hunger and disease severely ravaged the lives of the Congolese people, and the infant mortality rate was as high as 50%. Under such cruel plunder, the population of the Congo has decreased sharply, from 30 million in 1884 to the current 13 million. The Congo is a country rich in resources. The reserves of uranium, tin, copper, gold, and diamonds rank first in the capitalist world. It also exports a large amount of rare metals, rubber, coffee, cotton, and grain every year. However, the wealth created by the Congolese working people only feeds the monopoly capital groups. This is the true portrayal of the so-called "African black paradise" boasted by the Belgian colonialists. The Congolese people can no longer endure it, they must rise up to resist. Now, the light of resistance to colonial rule has finally erupted in the "oasis of stability." Although this light is not strong for the time being, it will eventually become a prairie fire. Lumumba, the representative of the Congolese National Movement Party who participated in the All-African People's Conference, said well: "After eighty years of colonial rule, we must break with the old system. We must give our country another face: the face of a free people free from all rule." This sentence reflects the wishes of more than 13 million Congolese people. The Congolese people who have risen up to fight will definitely realize this wish.

    The struggle of the Congolese people shows that in today's world, colonialists can no longer find any "oases of stability." Everywhere is a volcano, everywhere is an earthquake. Last year was a year of vigorous development of the national liberation movement. At the beginning of this new year, new good news came from Latin America and Africa. The struggle of the Congolese people against colonial rule echoes the victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista dictatorship. This foreshadows that in the new era, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will have greater development in both depth and breadth. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, all people who are subjected to imperialist oppression, as long as they dare to rise up and fight, they will surely be able to break the chains of colonialism and finally win the independence and freedom of the people.

    “安定的绿洲”燃烧起来了
    本报评论员
    在新的一年刚刚开始的时候，比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔市爆发了反对殖民统治的群众性斗争。由于刚果人民要求独立的政治性集会遭到殖民当局的无理禁止，群众举行的抗议性示威游行又遭到血腥镇压，刚果人民忍无可忍，拿起武器向殖民主义者开了火。这个斗争持续了好几天。比利时殖民当局慌了手脚，星夜调遣军警实行武装弹压，刚果的非洲居民死亡已达一百七十五人，伤数百人。目前，在利奥波德维尔市内，大规模的群众性反抗行动虽然被镇压下去，但是在这个城市附近的基穆恩扎和开山古鲁以及稍远一些的太斯维尔，反对殖民统治的群众性反抗行动还在此伏彼起地继续着。
    过去，比利时殖民者经常封锁关于刚果人民斗争的消息。可是，这次斗争爆发于刚果首府，看来是封锁不住了，于是比利时殖民者就想竭力歪曲事件的真相，把这次斗争说成是一些“失业群众”的“暴动”。但是，比利时殖民者的这种说法显然是骗不了任何人的，甚至连美国和英国的资产阶级报刊也承认这不是一个普通的事件，而是一次反对殖民统治的斗争。“纽约时报”掩饰不住自己的惊慌，大叫要防止比属刚果成为“另一个阿尔及利亚”。“泰晤士报”1月7日的评论说：“别的地方的欧洲人也将感到不安，因为他们始终把比属刚果看成是在一个愈来愈多事的大陆上的唯一一块安定的绿洲。而非洲民族主义者将欢欣鼓舞，因为他们将认为这次暴动表明：一次有力的解放运动终于在刚果展开了”。
    刚果人民的斗争，是对于他们长期以来遭受的痛苦的控诉，是多少年来郁积在他们心中的愤怒的爆发。从十八世纪开始，成千上万的刚果黑人就被贩卖到美洲和其他地方。在比利时国王利奥波尔二世统治比属刚果时期，将近一千万的无辜居民被杀害。殖民主义者的皮鞭和刺刀强迫工人和农民从事艰苦和无偿的劳动。饥饿和疾病严重地摧残着刚果人民的生命，婴孩死亡率高达50％。在这样残酷的掠夺下，刚果的人口急剧下降，从1884年的三千万人口降低到现在的一千三百多万人口。刚果是一个物产富饶的国家，铀、锡、铜、金和金刚石的蕴藏量都占资本主义世界第一位，每年还输出大量的稀有金属、橡胶、咖啡、棉花和粮食。但是，刚果劳动人民创造出来的财富却只是喂饱了垄断资本集团。这就是比利时殖民者所吹嘘的所谓“非洲黑人的乐园”的真实写照。刚果人民不能再忍受下去了，他们要起来反抗。现在，“安定的绿洲”终于爆发了反抗殖民统治的光芒。尽管这个光芒暂时还不是强大的，但是它终究会成为燎原的烈火。参加全非人民大会的刚果民族运动党的代表卢蒙巴说得好：“我们在八十年殖民统治之后，要同旧制度决裂。我们要使我们的国家具有另外一副面貌：一个摆脱一切统治的自由人民的面貌。”这句话反映了一千三百多万刚果人民的愿望。已经起来进行斗争的刚果人民是一定会实现这种愿望的。
    刚果人民的斗争说明，在今天的世界上，殖民者再也找不到任何一块“安定的绿洲”了。到处是火山，到处是地震。去年是民族解放运动蓬勃发展的一年。今年新年伊始，就从拉丁美洲和非洲传来新的捷音。刚果人民反对殖民统治的斗争，同古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的胜利遥相呼应。这预示着在新的年代里，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，不论在深度和广度上都将有更大的发展。在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一切遭受帝国主义压迫的人民，只要敢于起来进行斗争，他们就一定能够打断殖民主义者的锁链，而最后赢得人民的独立和自由。
