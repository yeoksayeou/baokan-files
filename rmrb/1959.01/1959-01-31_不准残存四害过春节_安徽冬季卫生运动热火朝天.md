Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th — Anhui Province is launching a winter hygiene campaign centered on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes, flies, sparrows, and rats. The slogan proposed by the masses is to thoroughly annihilate the remaining four pests and celebrate the Spring Festival cleanly and happily.

Recently, Party committees at all levels in the province, based on the provincial party committee's notice, have arranged hygiene work in conjunction with current production tasks. District committees convened telephone conferences, and many counties and cities held broadcast rallies. Subsequently, mass hygiene blitzes were launched in various locations. During the blitz week in the Lu'an Special District, tens of thousands of people engaged in hygiene activities daily in conjunction with production. The town of Lu'an and Shou County mobilized the masses to clear garbage and sludge on a large scale. The Wuhu Special District seized the opportunity of widespread snowfall in early January and promptly mobilized the masses to launch a three-day sparrow eradication blitz, achieving great results. Leading cadres in Anqing City led hygiene inspection teams to conduct inspections and guidance on the four pests elimination and hygiene promotion blitz in government offices, schools, urban residents' homes, and suburban people's communes.

Before the Spring Festival, all parts of the province also plan to carry out two more hygiene blitzes in conjunction with the mass custom of sweeping dust.

    不准残存四害过春节
    安徽冬季卫生运动热火朝天
    据新华社合肥30日电　安徽省各地正在掀起一个以消灭过冬蚊蝇和麻雀、老鼠为中心的冬季卫生运动。群众提出的口号是痛歼残存四害，干干净净、欢欢喜喜过春节。
    最近全省各级党委都根据省委的通知，结合当前生产任务布置了卫生工作。各地委分别召开了电话会议，很多县市召开了广播大会。接着各地群众的卫生突击活动就分别展开起来。六安专区在突击周内，每天都有成千上万的人结合生产搞卫生活动，六安、寿县的城关镇都发动群众大规模地清除了垃圾污泥。芜湖专区在1月初曾抓住当地普遍降雪的时机，及时发动群众以三天时间开展一个围剿麻雀的突击运动，获得很大战果。安庆市有关领导干部带领卫生检查团深入机关、学校、市民住宅、郊区人民公社检查和指导除四害讲卫生突击运动。
    在春节以前，全省各地还准备结合群众中扫尘的习惯，再开展两次卫生突击活动。
