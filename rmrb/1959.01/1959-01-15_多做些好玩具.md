    Make More Good Toys
    Qin Li
    I picked out a green plastic toy clock from the toy department of a children's store, intending to give it to my daughter, who will be six years old soon, for her birthday. This small, emerald-green clock is not only realistically like a real clock, but also has a delicate and compact appearance. Moreover, the hour and minute hands can be moved correctly, and the price is cheap. Children can learn the basics of telling time by playing with the hour and minute hands. This little toy is really good!
    But these kinds of good toys are still few and far between. Since the rural people's communes were established, thousands upon thousands of kindergartens and nurseries have been set up, and the need for toys has greatly increased. Not only is the quantity of toys in short supply, but the variety of designs is also not very large. There are not many really good toys, especially those designed according to the age characteristics of children. There are more static toys, and fewer that can inspire children's enthusiasm and creativity. The prices of general toys are relatively high, some as high as several yuan to more than ten yuan. There are fewer durable and cheap toys.
    Why not make more wooden toys? Wooden toys have many advantages: children like wooden toys that can be disassembled and assembled, and building block toys. At the same time, wooden toys can utilize waste and scrap materials, the cost is low, materials can be obtained locally, and the production is relatively simple, and they are durable. It is really worth producing more.
    Toys occupy a very important position in children's lives. They are children's close companions and also textbooks for conducting communist education and enlightening children's wisdom. With the rapid development of our country's production and the continuous improvement of people's lives, the demand for toys has generally and greatly increased. Toys should be plentiful and good. The shape, color, and decoration of toys should all be beautiful. Toys may be small, but they must not be made carelessly. It is hoped that our art designers and educators will all pay attention to the cultural life of children, design more and better cheap toys, to cultivate the morality of our successors, cultivate children's noble aesthetic sentiments, inspire their creativity, and cultivate their love for labor!

    多做些好玩具
    秦犁
    从儿童商店玩具部挑选了一只绿色的塑料玩具座钟，预备送给我将满六岁的女儿过生日。这座翠绿可爱的小钟，不仅富有钟的真实感，外形小巧玲珑，而且长短针还能正确拨动，价钱也便宜。孩子们可以拨弄着那长短针学习看钟点的常识。这小玩具真不错！
    但这种好玩具毕竟还是不多的。自从农村人民公社化以后，办起了成千上万的幼儿园、托儿所，玩具的需要大大增加。玩具不但在数量上供不应求，而且花色品种上也不算多，真正好的玩具、特别是根据孩子们的年龄特点设计的玩具不多。静的玩具比较多，能启发孩子们的积极性和创造性的少。一般玩具价钱都较高，有的高到几元以至十多元，结实耐久，价钱便宜的较少。
    为什么不多做些木玩具呢？木玩具有很多优点：孩子们喜欢那些能拆能装的木玩具、积木玩具。同时木制玩具可以利用废物、碎材，成本低廉，就地取材，制作也较简单，而且结实耐久。实在值得多生产。
    玩具在儿童的生活中占很重要的地位，它是儿童的亲密伴侣，也是对儿童进行共产主义教育和启发儿童智慧的教科书。随着我们国家生产的飞跃发展，人民生活的不断提高，玩具的需要量也就普遍地大量地增加了。玩具要多，也要好。玩具的造型、色彩、装饰都应该是美的。玩具虽小，但马虎不得。希望我们的美术设计家们，教育家们，都来关心孩子们的文化生活，设计更多、更好的便宜的玩具，来陶冶我们接班人的品德，培养孩子们高尚的审美情操，来启发他们的创造性、培养他们对劳动的热爱吧！
