As the end of winter approaches, Taiwan's society is becoming increasingly depressed amidst gusts of cold wind. The general public servants, workers, clerks, and impoverished people are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. Not to mention the distant past, in just the last month or two, the United States, in order to further plunder Taiwan, forced the Chiang Kai-shek Group to implement exchange rate reforms in November, devaluing the Taiwan dollar, which triggered a surge in prices on the Taiwan market. Imported American oil, wheat, and cotton, as well as related daily necessities such as flour, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, have all risen in price. Around the New Year, the price increases are even more widespread, with highways, railways, buses, and tap water all scrambling to adjust fares and charges.

Due to the continuous decline in the purchasing power of the Taiwanese people and the heavy taxes imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek Group, Taiwan's industry and commerce are becoming increasingly sluggish, leading to the closure of factories and shops since the second half of 1958, resulting in massive unemployment. This has plunged even more people into starvation and cold. Currently, in Taipei City alone, there are more than 43,000 impoverished people crying out for food and warmth, urgently in need of relief. If you browse through recent Taiwanese newspapers, various cases of suicide, homicide, and crime are emerging endlessly.

  Coal Miners in Desperate Straits
    In Taipei County, famous for its coal production, most of the mines are facing coal sales stagnation, and the capital turnover is not working. Wages of workers have been in arrears for a long time. According to investigations, the wages owed to coal miners in this county currently amount to five or six months in some cases, and at least two months in others. Wu Jinsheng, a coal miner in Ruifang Town who bore the heavy burden of supporting a family of seven, lost his son due to the hardships of life. Finally, one night, he quietly went to his son's grave and committed suicide by taking poison. After his death, his wife and four young daughters found themselves in an even more miserable situation than before. Currently, how many families are like Wu Jinsheng's among the workers in Taiwan? Taiwanese newspapers say that in Taipei County alone, there are tens of thousands of coal miners and their families whose lives have reached the brink of despair because the mines have not paid wages for several months.

  Tragic Family Suicide
    The day before New Year's Eve, Zhuang Xi, the chairman and general manager of Lun Hsiang Textile Company, one of the famous textile factories in Taipei City, committed collective suicide by taking poison with his wife, children, and five family members. Zhuang Xi and his youngest daughter died on the 31st, while his wife, son, and daughter were still in the hospital after emergency treatment. This shocking tragedy immediately caused a sensation in Taipei and shook Taiwan's business community.

    Under the economic plunder of the United States, Taiwan's textile industry is becoming increasingly depressed. Lun Hsiang Textile Company's debts have far exceeded its total assets. If all assets were used to offset debts, there would still be a deficit of 8 million Taiwan dollars. Faced with the harsh reality, Zhuang Xi was finally unable to continue to support himself, and was tragically forced to perish with his entire family.

  People Who "Voluntarily" Go to Jail
    On the night before New Year's Day, a young man came to a small restaurant on Kangding Road in Taipei City. After eating and drinking his fill, he couldn't pay the bill. Therefore, the owner sent him to the Taipei Police Station Detention Center on charges of "fraud and deception."

    This young man's surname is Huang, he is twenty-six years old this year. He used to work in a mine in Taipei, but later became unemployed and roamed around. Driven to desperation by life, he came up with the idea of making a living in prison, so he ate a free meal at the restaurant. In this way, he could temporarily fill his hungry stomach and also take this opportunity to be sent to prison. Similar things have been happening frequently in various parts of Taiwan recently. Some homeless unemployed people try every means to create crimes for themselves in order to find a place to settle down and find a way to go to jail.

    Recently, Taiwanese newspapers also reported that in Yilan County, an unemployed man named Chen Bogao, "unable to bear poverty and illness, willingly went to jail." Because he had been unemployed for a long time, unable to find a job, and suffering from serious lung disease, he was finally forced to run to the police station of the Chiang Kai-shek Group and confessed that he was a "deserter," requesting to be dealt with according to the law and go to jail. However, under the police's investigation, his true identity and purpose were discovered, and even his dream of going to jail was shattered.

      Fifth Suicide Attempt
    Taiwanese newspapers recently reported that a small civil servant in Taipei City named Qiu Yingxuan hanged himself when his wife was not at home, but was fortunately discovered and rescued by his wife and neighbors. However, because the hanging time was too long, his neck was severely injured, and coupled with the fact that he had been bedridden for a long time, he was left in a dying state even after being rescued. His wife and three children, helpless, surrounded him and cried incessantly. Qiu Yingxuan was originally from Guangdong. After following the Kuomintang to Taiwan in 1949, he worked in the Central Trust Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek Group. Later, he suffered from lung disease due to overwork and was dismissed for being deemed "physically unqualified." Since then, in order to support his family of five, he had to work desperately at temporary jobs every day, which made his illness worse. In the midst of poverty and illness, he had attempted suicide four times before. This was his fifth suicide attempt. Such encounters are not isolated cases among lower-level public servants and teachers of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. More lower and middle-level public servants and teachers have to find part-time jobs to maintain the minimum living standards of their wives and children, rushing from day shifts to night shifts. They are exhausted all day long. Many people's wives also have to go out to work for others, or run small stalls. Even so, they can still only live a half-starved life. Therefore, many people have to pawn their meager belongings to survive. According to statistics, more than 50% of the customers in pawnshops are public servants and teachers. Even Taiwanese newspapers cannot but admit that Taiwanese public servants and teachers are "indeed on the verge of starvation and cold." "Zili Wanbao" said that the treatment of middle and lower-level military personnel, public servants, and teachers in Taiwan has reached an unbearable level. This newspaper urged the Taiwan authorities to quickly "save the public servants and teachers." Otherwise, there is a risk that this resentment will "vent internally."

    "Hunger and Cold Breed Thieves"
    On December 26, 1958, on Chongqing Road in Taipei City in broad daylight, an old woman named Xu Zhi was pushed to the ground on the street and had 10,000 Taiwan dollars she was carrying stolen. Several such daylight robbery cases have occurred in Taipei City recently. For example, the gold ornaments of Jin Yongfeng Jewelry Store in Taipei City were robbed. The Jinlong Jewelry Store on Guangzhou Street in Taipei was also robbed. Recently, a street robbery also occurred in Tainan City. Even the heavily guarded residential area of Americans often experiences burglaries. Taiwanese newspapers are constantly reporting the fact that thefts are becoming more and more frequent. "Lianhe Bao" described Taiwan's winter as a "season of rampant theft" and believes that this is because "hunger and cold breed thieves."

    台湾岁末的悲剧
    方元慧
    时近残冬，在一阵阵的寒风中，台湾社会也越来越不景气，一般公教人员、工人、小职员和贫苦的老百姓，日子也越来越难熬。远的不说，仅在最近的一、两个月内，美国为更进一步对台湾进行掠夺，迫令蒋介石集团在11月份实行汇率改革，把台币贬值，就引起台湾市场上一片涨风，进口的美国石油、小麦和棉花以及和这类物资有关的面粉、棉纱、棉布等生活日用品，就纷纷涨价。新年前后，更是一片涨价声，公路、铁路、公共汽车、自来水等也紧跟着一窝蜂地都要调整票价和收费标准。
    由于台湾人民购买力的不断下降和蒋介石集团的苛重捐税，使台湾工商业愈来愈萧条，以致1958年下半年以来，工厂商店纷纷倒闭，造成大批工人失业。这样，使更多的人陷入了饥寒交迫的境地。目前，只台北市就有啼饥号寒急待救济的贫民四万三千多人。如果翻开最近的台湾报纸，各种自杀、凶杀和犯罪案件更是层出不穷。
  绝境中的煤矿工人
    以产煤著名的台北县，大部分的矿场都因煤炭滞销，煤矿周转不灵，长期拖欠工人工资。据调查，目前这个县煤矿积欠工人的工资，多的达五、六个月之久，少的也在两个月以上。瑞芳镇一个担负着一家七口生活重担的煤矿工人吴金生，就是在生活磨折下，又死了儿子，最后，在一个夜晚，他悄悄地到他儿子墓前服毒自杀身死。他死后，他的妻子和四个年幼的女儿，处境比过去更加悲惨。目前，在台湾工人中，又何止吴金生的一家如此？台湾报纸说，仅台北一县，就有数万煤矿工人和他们的家属，因为矿场好几个月没有发放工资，生活已临绝境。
  全家自杀的惨剧
    除夕的前一天，台北市著名的纺织厂之一的纶祥纺织公司董事长兼总经理庄熹，和他的妻子儿女一家五口集体服毒自杀。庄熹和他的幼女先后在31日死亡，他的妻子和一子一女经急救后还在医院里。这件惊人的惨案，当即轰动台北，震动了台湾工商界。
    在美国经济掠夺下，台湾纺织业日益不景气。纶祥纺织公司所负的债务，已远远超过了它的全部的资产。如果以资产全部抵偿债务，尚亏空台币八百万元。庄熹在严酷的事实面前，终于无法继续支撑下去，最后逼得走投无路，悲惨地和全家同归于尽。
  “自愿”坐牢的人
    新年前一天晚上，台北市康定路的一个小吃店里，来了个年青的客人。在大吃饱喝了一顿之后，算账时他却付不起钱。因而，被老板以“欺诈骗财”的罪名把他送进了台北警察局拘留所。
    这个青年姓黄，今年二十六岁，过去曾在台北一家矿场工作，后来失了业，到处流浪。被生活迫得走投无路，于是想出了到监狱去糊口的念头，就到饭店白吃一顿，这样，既可以暂充饥肠，也可借此机会被送进监牢。类似这样的事情，最近以来，台湾各地常常发生。一些无家可归的失业者为了找个安身之地，千方百计地为自己制造罪名，想办法坐牢。
    最近，台湾报纸还以“不堪贫病煎迫，浪汉自甘坐牢”为题，报道了宜兰县一个叫陈伯高的失业者，因为失业日久，求职无门，又患了严重的肺病。最后，他被迫跑进蒋介石集团警察局派出所，自认是“逃兵”，要求法办坐牢。但是，在警察的盘查下，发现了他的真正身份和目的，以致连坐牢的梦想也破灭了。
      第五次自杀
    台湾报纸在不久前报道了台北市一个叫丘莹轩的小公务员，乘他的妻子不在家时上吊自杀，幸被他妻子和邻人发觉救活。但是，因上吊时间过长，脖子受了重伤，加上原来已是长期卧病，救活后也只剩了奄奄一息。他的妻子和三个孩子，无依无靠围着他痛哭不止。丘莹轩原是广东人，1949年随国民党到台湾后，就在蒋介石集团中央信托局工作，后来因为劳累过度而患了肺病，被认为“身体不合格”解雇。此后，他为了维持一家五口的生活，只好每天拼命做临时苦工，这么一来使他的病体更恶化了。在贫病交迫中，他先后曾自杀四次。这一次，已是第五次的自杀了。台湾国民党下级公教人员中，像丘莹轩这样遭遇并不是个别的。更多的中下级公教人员为维持他们妻子儿女最低的生活，只好设法找兼职，匆匆忙忙赶了日班又去赶夜班。终日疲于奔命。不少人的妻子还要出去为人帮工，或兼营小摊贩。就是如此，也仍然只能过着半饥半饱的生活。因此，许多人只好靠典当仅有的一点衣物过活。据统计，在押店的顾客中，50％以上都是公教人员。连台湾报纸也不能不承认台湾公教人员
  “实已不折不扣的濒于饥寒边沿”了。“自立晚报”说，现在台湾中下级军、公、教人员的待遇，已到了无可再捱的程度。这家报纸要求台湾当局快“救救公教人员”。否则这股怨气就有“向内发泄”的危险了。
    “饥寒盗贼多”
    1958年12月26日，台北市重庆路在光天化日之下，一个叫徐织的老太太在街上被人推倒，抢去了她携带的台币一万元。像这样白昼抢劫的案件，最近在台北市已连续发生了好几起。如台北市金永丰银楼的金饰被抢。台北广州街金龙银楼也被抢劫。台南市最近也发生了当街抢劫案，甚至连警戒森严的美国人住宅区，也时常发生盗窃事件。台湾报纸不断报道偷窃事件愈来愈多的事实。“联合报”把台湾的冬天说成是“盗窃猖獗的季节”，并且认为这是“饥寒盗贼多”。
