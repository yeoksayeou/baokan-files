Fuzhou—The winter seed collection and afforestation campaign launched in Fujian Province has achieved remarkable results. As of December 26th, the province had collected 23.8 million catties of seeds, accounting for 82% of the annual plan; 1.86 million mu of forest land had been prepared; and 1.29 million mu had been afforested in the winter. The cumulative afforestation for the year reached 6.53 million mu.

Since the Provincial Party Committee convened the Nan'an Forestry On-Site Conference, the winter afforestation campaign in various places has been further developed. The Longxi Special District has afforested more than 468,000 mu. Zhao'an County launched a winter afforestation blitz week from December 13th to 15th, with December 15th as a high-yield afforestation day. More than 60,000 people were mobilized throughout the county in one day, afforesting more than 74,000 mu. Yunxiao County afforested more than 63,000 mu in one week. The Jinjiang Special District has afforested more than 590,000 mu in the winter. Nan'an County in the district afforested more than 93,600 mu from October to the end of December, and another 620,000 mu in January, making it the county with the highest afforestation area in the province. The Minbei area is currently carrying out large-scale forest land preparation work. So far, Nan'an, Hui'an, Yongtai, Longxi, Xiapu, Lianjiang, Xianyou, and Ninghua eight counties and 380 townships across the province have all completed their afforestation plans ahead of schedule in all suitable afforestation areas.

On the basis of vigorously promoting greening, various places are also carrying out a high-yield forest campaign. Counties in the Jinjiang Special District have cultivated more than 20,000 mu of various fast-growing and high-yield forests, and many areas have formulated plans to achieve "gardenization" in their respective regions.
