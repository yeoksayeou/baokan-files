    Broken Internal Combustion Engine Transformed into Locomotive
    Tai Gu
    The ten-li railway from the county seat to the Fengshan No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, the first local railway in Taigu County, is now under intensive track-laying.
    On the rails sits a brand-new, light-green locomotive, looking just like a city bus from afar. Newcomers would surely think it was manufactured by some automobile factory. However, it is a product of the Taigu Machinery Plant, a small factory with only a few small and old lathes, mainly engaged in casting.
    On July 14th last year, after Comrade Qi Runlin, the Party branch secretary of the machinery plant, old worker Hu Xiuwen, and technician Xiao Kang visited Meng County to see the small train, the plant accepted the task of manufacturing a small train. At that time, some people lacked confidence, saying: Our small factory lacks both equipment and technology, how can we make a train? In response to this situation, the Party branch successively convened meetings of veteran workers and technical personnel to organize everyone to debate. Fu Jingzhi, an old worker who had been a foundry worker for more than forty years, said: "What the people of Meng County can do, we can also do. This is a task assigned by the Party, and it must be completed." After the debate, all the workers in the plant gained confidence and unanimously expressed that they would refit it within half a month to present it as a gift for the "August 1st" Army Day.
    Learning from the methods of Meng County, they decided to experiment with a discarded and broken internal combustion engine from a sedan car. However, this internal combustion engine was already in terrible shape. Items like the distributor, starter motor, bearing shells, expansion rings... there were more than ten kinds of these precision parts missing. What to do? Send someone to Taiyuan to find replacements! Unexpectedly, the person sent went for four or five days and still couldn't find them. If we can't buy them, we'll have to make them ourselves.
    Making them ourselves, there were indeed many difficulties. Technically, there was no one in the whole plant who was proficient in internal combustion engines; in terms of equipment, there was not even a planer or a drill press, not even a small crane. But they were not daunted by the difficulties. When manufacturing the "T"-shaped bearing shells, without a planer, the branch secretary and the factory director went to the workshop to try using a lathe instead. They turned and discussed with the workers, changing the original "T"-shaped bearing shells to rectangular ones, and quickly made them.
    The most difficult part to make was the distributor, because its precision was very high. Without cast steel, they had to saw a section of steel rail to replace it. They turned it a little, measured it a little, measured it a little, and then turned it a little more. After it was turned, they filed it carefully once more, taking a whole day to complete.
    When assembling and manufacturing the chassis, without a drill press, everyone used a hand drill to drill holes. It took more than half an hour to drill a hole in a two-fen thick iron plate. Riveter Luo Chunlin boldly tried using electric welding to make the holes. When the electric welding wire was not enough, he used old wire to connect it. He worked continuously for four days.
    That is how the workers of the entire factory struggled hard for seven days, and a locomotive was finally made.

    破内燃机变成机车
    泰沽
    从县城通往凤山第一炼铁厂的长达十里的铁路，是太谷县第一条土铁路，现在正在紧张地铺轨。
    道轨上停放着一辆崭新的浅绿色的火车头，远远望去，真像城市里的公共汽车。刚到这里的人，一定以为是哪家汽车制造厂制造的，然而它却是一个只有几台又小又旧的车床，以铸造为主的小厂——太谷机械厂的产品。
    去年7月14日，机械厂的党支部书记齐润林同志、老工人胡修文和技术员小康到盂县去参观小火车以后，厂里就接受了制造小火车的任务。当时有一部分人信心不足，他们说：咱们这小厂子，要设备没设备，要技术没技术，还能制火车？党支部针对这一情况，连续召开了老工人会、技术人员会，组织大家辩论。当了四十多年铸工的老工人傅景之说：“盂县人民能办的事，咱也能办。这是党交给的任务，一定得完成。”经过辩论，全厂工人有了信心，一致表示，要在半个月内改装出来，给“八一”节献礼。
    他们学习盂县的办法，决定用废置的破轿车的内燃机来试验。可是这架内燃机已经破得不成样子了。像什么分火器呀、起动马达、轴瓦、涨圈，……等，光是这些精密机件，就缺十多种。怎么办呢？派人到太原去配吧！不料派去的人去了四、五天也配不上。买不到，就只好自己动手造了。
    自己造，困难真不少。在技术上全厂一个精通内燃机的也没有；在设备上，连刨床、钻床都没有，连个小吊车也没有。但是他们并没有被困难难倒。在制造“丁”形轴瓦的时候，没有刨床，支部书记和厂长就到车间去试用旋床代替，他们一边旋，一边和工人商量，把原来“丁”字形的轴瓦改成了长方形，很快就制成了。
    最难做的零件要算分火器，因为它的精密度很高，没有铸钢，他们只好锯了一段钢轨来代替，他们旋一旋，量一量，量一量，再旋一旋。旋成以后，又用锉细细地锉了一次，整整搞了一天才搞成。
    装配和制造车架的时候，没有钻床，大家就用手摇钻来钻孔。二分厚的铁板，钻一个孔就得半个多钟头。铆工罗春林就大胆地试用电焊来打眼，电焊线不够用，就用旧电线接上干。他一连干了四天。
    全厂的工人们，就是这样苦战了七天，一个火车头终于制成了。
