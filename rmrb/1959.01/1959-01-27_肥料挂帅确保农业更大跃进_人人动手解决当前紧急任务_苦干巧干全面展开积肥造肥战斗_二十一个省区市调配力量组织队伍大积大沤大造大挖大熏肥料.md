Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: The rural areas across the country urgently need to launch a more extensive surge in fertilizer accumulation than last year, driving all aspects of current rural work and agricultural construction. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, winter fertilizer accumulation and creation have seen some achievements. Incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions show that over 200 billion dan of various natural farm fertilizers have been accumulated, averaging over 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land. Additionally, a significant amount of locally produced chemical fertilizer has been produced. The area of green manure crops planted in winter in southern provinces and regions has slightly increased compared to last year. However, in terms of the need for fertilizer to support a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year, both the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated and created in various regions are still insufficient.

The Northeast and Northwest regions, due to the absence of autumn planting or a very small autumn planting area, started winter fertilizer accumulation work earlier and on a larger scale. Heilongjiang Province currently has over 700,000 people involved in the movement of accumulating, creating, and transporting fertilizer. In many parts of Liaoning Province, large-scale smoking and high-temperature composting are underway. People's communes in the plains with peat resources are concentrating their efforts on digging peat. Along the coast, carts and horses transporting sea mud and shells are constantly on the move in various communes. Many agricultural areas in Xinjiang have also recently launched a campaign to accumulate fertilizer. In Luntai County, due to strong leadership and a large fertilizer accumulation team, over 1.9 billion jin of fertilizer were accumulated in a ten-day surge, approaching the total amount of the previous fertilizer accumulation year. Party organizations at all levels in Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, are seizing the opportunity to summarize and promote good fertilizer accumulation methods, resulting in rapid and high-quality progress in fertilizer accumulation. Gansu Province recently held a provincial on-site promotion meeting for fertilizer accumulation, creation, and local pesticide production in Lintao, demanding that the province accumulate enough fertilizer for spring sowing before the Spring Festival. After the meeting, a fertilizer accumulation and creation movement is underway.

As for the southern regions, because autumn harvesting and winter planting ended late, fertilizer accumulation started relatively late. Many areas are now catching up. Communes in Anhui Province are adopting various methods to work hard and cleverly, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated and created has increased rapidly recently. Since the beginning of the new year, the daily amount of fertilizer accumulated has doubled compared to before. The Foshan Special Zone in Guangdong Province is closely integrating rectification of communes with production, and the fertilizer accumulation movement is also rapidly unfolding. Currently, various regions are combining rectification work to draw labor to strengthen the fertilizer accumulation and creation teams, and a high tide of winter fertilizer accumulation is expected to form rapidly. In mid-January, Fujian Province shifted the deep plowing army to the fertilizer accumulation front. Nanping Special Zone already has over 250,000 people accumulating fertilizer, and most of the over 30,000 fertilizer plants have started work to rush to produce local chemical fertilizers and mixed fertilizers. Potassium fertilizer resources were discovered in Pinghe County, and a factory has been built to produce potassium sulfate.

Since the beginning of winter, fertilizer accumulation work in various regions has shown some different characteristics from the past. First, many communes have paid attention to establishing professional fertilizer accumulation teams. For example, Qinxian County in Shanxi Province organized tens of thousands of people into professional fertilizer accumulation teams, launching competitions among communes, teams, and individuals in fertilizer accumulation. In Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, each commune from the commune to the management area has established fertilizer accumulation command structures, with fertilizer source survey teams, fertilizer appraisal groups, and fertilizer tool reform groups to ensure the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulation. These situations show that fertilizer accumulation work is being done more meticulously than in the past. In order to save labor in transporting fertilizer, various regions have also paid attention to promoting on-site fertilizer accumulation and creation experiences and improving fertilizer transportation tools. The Yubei area and the Funiu Mountains in Henan Province have launched the "Thousand Mu Hundred Pools" movement, advocating on-site composting and on-site application. Fanzi County in Shanxi Province promoted the method of "digging fertilizer pits in the fields, setting up fertilizer accumulation stations on the roads, building toilets at the edges of the fields, and applying sheep manure to the fields." Communes in Xiangtan Special Zone, Hunan Province, have built large ponds (compost water pits) in the fields, each capable of storing around 10,000 dan of fertilizer, which the commune members call "fertilizer banks." The implementation of these methods has shortened the time for round-trip fertilizer delivery and effectively saved labor. Vigorously developing local chemical fertilizers to meet the needs of densely planted crops for fast-acting topdressing, and combining deep plowing and weed removal to smoke the soil to increase the fertility of cultivated land, are also some characteristics of fertilizer accumulation and creation after communization. Jiangsu Province, which last year completely relied on sulfur support from other provinces to extinguish wheat stem rust, has now begun to use local sulfur mines to manufacture chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The abundant peat resources in the three northeastern provinces have also been widely utilized due to the large-scale development of local chemical fertilizers by the communes. Since the beginning of winter, various regions have also gained some good experience in fertilizer accumulation. For example, when carrying out fertilizer accumulation, Handan Special Zone in Hebei Province mobilized the masses to calculate three accounts: the fertilizer demand account, the production increase account, and the fertilizer shortage account. Cadres then investigated the fertilizer situation and the ideological situation. Based on the calculations and investigations, propaganda and education work was carried out among the masses, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses for fertilizer accumulation. Recently, in Yao'an County, Yunnan Province, the secretary took the lead, established a fertilizer accumulation command, organized a professional fertilizer accumulation team, and implemented the "five personnel combination" method, and the fertilizer accumulation movement quickly reached a high tide. The so-called five personnel combination means that livestock keepers are responsible for manure, pens, etc., herders accumulate fertilizer while grazing, transporters strive to avoid fertilizer loss during transportation, field management personnel are responsible for composting in the fields, and cooks regularly clean up stove ash to accumulate ash fertilizer. After adopting various fertilizer accumulation methods in Jiangxi, such as "cutting on the mountains, scraping on the plains, sweeping at home, picking outside, digging in pits, scooping in the water, composting in the fields, and burning in the fields," the fertilizer accumulation movement was widely launched. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, Wuzhai County in Shanxi Province implemented methods such as "fixing people, quantity, quality, time, and remuneration," and put forward the slogans of "mass accumulation, mass composting, mass creation, mass digging, and mass smoking," and the fertilizer accumulation movement quickly reached a high tide.

Various regions have also paid more attention to quality issues in fertilizer accumulation than in the past. According to estimates by the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture, taking the application of 50,000 to 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu as an example, doubling the quality of the fertilizer can save 10 to 15 labor days. Therefore, the province emphasized the requirement of emphasizing both the quantity and quality of fertilizer. Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, stipulated quality standards in the fertilizer accumulation movement and strictly conducted inspections and acceptance. If fertilizer was found to be substandard, methods such as mixing with manure and composting or pressing were taken to improve fertilizer efficiency. (Attached picture)

    肥料挂帅确保农业更大跃进  人人动手解决当前紧急任务
    苦干巧干全面展开积肥造肥战斗
    二十一个省区市调配力量组织队伍大积大沤大造大挖大熏肥料
    据新华社25日讯　全国农村急需立即开展一个比去年规模更大的、在当前农村工作、农业建设上带动一切的突击积肥运动的高潮。据农业部了解：冬季以来的积肥、造肥工作已有成绩，据二十一个省、市、自治区不完全统计，已积各种农家自然肥料二千多亿担，平均每亩耕地有肥一万多斤；另外还生产了大量的土制化肥。南方各省、区冬种的绿肥作物面积比上年略有扩大。但就今年农业生产上更大跃进对肥料的需要来说，各地已完成的积肥、造肥无论数量或质量都还不够。
    东北和西北地区由于没有秋种或秋种面积很小，冬季积肥工作动手较早，规模较大。黑龙江省目前共有七十多万人投入积肥、造肥和送肥运动。辽宁省许多地方都在大搞熏肥和高温沤肥；平原地区有草炭资源的人民公社，正在集中力量挖草炭；沿海各地公社拉运海泥和贝壳的车马络绎不绝。新疆许多农区最近也展开了突击积肥运动。轮台县由于领导抓得紧，积肥队伍强大，十天突击积肥十九亿多斤，接近上一积肥年度的总量。宁夏回族自治区同心县各级党组织抓紧总结和推广好的积肥方法，积肥进展较快，并且质量较好。甘肃省最近在临洮召开了一次全省积肥、造肥、土农药制造现场促进会议，要求全省在春节前积够春播所需肥料。会后积肥、造肥运动正在展开。
    至于南方各地，因秋收冬种结束得晚，积肥动手较迟，不少地区目前才在迎头赶上。安徽省各地公社采取各种办法大干巧干，积肥造肥数量最近增加较快。新年开始以来，每天积肥量比以前多一倍。广东省佛山专区把整社和生产紧密结合在一起，积肥运动也正在迅速展开。目前各地正在结合整社工作，抽调劳动力加强积肥、造肥的队伍，冬季大积肥的高潮可望迅速形成。福建省1月中旬已把深翻大军转到了积肥战线，南平专区已有二十五万多人积肥，三万多肥料厂大部都已动工赶制土化肥和混合肥。平和县发现了钾肥资源，已建厂生产硫酸钾。
    入冬以来各地的积肥工作表现了一些与过去不同的特点。首先是很多公社都注意了建立积肥的专业队伍。如山西省沁县组织了几万人的积肥专业队，在积肥中开展了社与社、队与队、个人与个人的竞赛。广东省增城县各公社从社到管理区都成立了积肥指挥机构，下面还设有肥源勘查队、肥料鉴定小组、积肥工具改革小组，来保证积肥的数量和质量。这些情况说明：积肥工作作得比过去细致些。为了节省运送肥料的劳力，各地还注意了推行就地积肥、造肥的经验，改进了运肥工具。河南省豫北地区和伏牛山区开展了“千亩百池”运动，提倡就地沤肥，就地施用。山西省繁峙县推广了“地挖造肥坑、路设积肥站、地头建厕所、羊粪到田间”的办法。湖南省湘潭专区各公社在田头建立大氹（沤肥水坑），每个可以储肥万担左右，社员们把它叫做“肥料库”。这些办法的实行，都缩短了往返送肥的时间，有效地节省了劳力。大搞土化肥来满足作物密植对速效性追肥的需要，结合深翻、清除杂草等进行熏土来增加耕地的肥力，也是公社化后积肥、造肥的一些特点。去年还完全依靠外省支援硫磺来扑灭小麦秆锈病的江苏省，现在已经开始采用当地的硫矿来制造化肥和农药。东北三省蕴藏很丰富的草炭，也由于公社大搞土化肥得到了广泛的利用。入冬以来，各地积肥工作还取得了一些好的经验。如河北省邯郸专区在开展积肥时，发动群众算了肥料需要账、增产账和肥料不足账等三笔账，又由干部摸了肥料底和思想底两个底，根据算账、摸底的情况，对群众进行了宣传教育工作，大大鼓励了广大群众的积肥热情。云南省姚安县最近由书记挂帅，成立了积肥指挥部，组织了积肥的专业队伍，并实行了“五员大结合”的办法，积肥运动很快就达到热火朝天的高潮。所谓五员结合，就是饲养员包厩肥、圈肥等，放牧员边放牧边积肥，运输员力争运送中不流失肥料，田间管理人员负责在地头沤制，炊事员定期清理灶灰大积灰肥。江西各地在采取“山上砍、平地铲、家里扫、外面拣、坑里挖、水里捞、田里沤、地里烧”的多种积肥办法后，积肥运动就广泛地展开了。山西省五寨县在积肥运动中实行了“定人、定量、定质、定时、定酬”等办法，提出了“大积、大沤、大造、大挖、大熏”的口号，积肥运动很快达到了高潮。
    各地在积肥中对质量问题也比过去注意。据湖北省农业厅估计，以每亩施肥五万到十万斤为例，提高肥料质量一倍，即可节省人工十到十五个。因此这个省强调提出了肥料数量与质量并重的要求。宁夏回族自治区同心县在积肥运动中规定了质量标准，严格进行检查验收；发现不够标准的肥料，都要采取拌粪和沤、压等方法来提高肥效。（附图片）
