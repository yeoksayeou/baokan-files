Walking on Two Legs, Covering a Thousand Miles a Day

    The rapid development of local industry in 1958 has increased the proportion of heavy industry in various regions, and the national industrial layout has begun to move towards balance, which will play a huge role in the industrialization of the communes.

    (By our reporter Tian Lin) Our reporter Tian Lin interviewed a person in charge of the State Economic Commission on the situation and significance of the great leap forward in local industry last year. From the conversation with this responsible comrade, it can be seen that the situation and characteristics of the great leap forward in local industry in my country in 1958 can be described and summarized in four sentences. These are: "Let a hundred flowers bloom, stars all over the sky, walking on two legs, covering a thousand miles a day." According to preliminary estimates, the output value of local industry across the country in 1958 increased by more than 60% compared with last year.

    This encouraging phenomenon is a huge achievement of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in implementing the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao of taking central industry as the key link and developing central industry and local industry simultaneously.

    In 1958, the composition of local industry underwent great changes. In the past, local industries were mostly light industries, only producing means of subsistence; in 1958, in addition to some heavy industries decentralized by the central government, various places also started many heavy industries on their own, so the proportion of heavy industry in local industries greatly increased, and most provinces, cities, and autonomous regions were able to produce means of production. Of the approximately 11 million tons of steel produced nationwide in 1958, approximately 3 million tons were produced by modern steel plants and small, indigenous steel furnaces in local iron and steel industries. The machinery industry in local industry has also developed greatly. The number of machine tools produced in various places alone reached more than 40,000. There are also tens of thousands of small coal mines and indigenous cement kilns across the country. More than 40,000 were put into production in only thirteen provinces and cities, with a production capacity of more than one million tons. Industries such as electric power, chemical fertilizers, and petroleum have also developed. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1,400 small oil factories have been newly built across the country; in Liaoning Province alone, the power generation capacity of small power stations has reached 120,000 kilowatts. Local industries not only have these small-scale heavy industries, but are also building many large and medium-sized industries. For example, Hebei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces and regions are building steel plants with an annual output of 600,000 tons of steel; Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Yunnan, Shaanxi and other provinces and regions are building machinery factories with an annual output of 20,000 tons of heavy machinery and equipment. As for power stations of 100,000 kilowatts and above, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are building them. While vigorously developing heavy industry, various places have also paid attention to developing light industries closely related to people's lives, such as textiles, sugar making, brewing, and paper making. It is truly a hundred flowers blooming, colorful, and everything available.

    In the past, my country's industry was mainly concentrated in coastal and a few inland areas, while in 1958, industry was vigorously developed throughout the country. It is estimated that the number of newly built industrial units in each province, city, and autonomous region this year has reached several million. This has brought about a great change in the distribution of my country's industry. Provinces and regions such as Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Guizhou, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Fujian used to have a very weak industrial base. At present, in addition to the construction of many large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, the industrial enterprises run by counties and special zones alone have numbered in the thousands. Within the provinces and autonomous regions, industry is not only concentrated in a few large and medium-sized cities as in the past, but is also being built in key cities and is distributed relatively evenly in various special zones, county towns, and villages, like "stars all over the sky."

    The development of local industry, especially the industry of the people's communes, will play a huge role in my country's industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification. The exhibition held by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Macheng proved that indigenous iron and steel can be used to make various indigenous machine tools and various indigenous power machines, and can also be used to make various new agricultural implements, and can also be used to build railways, cars, and ships. Therefore, with indigenous steel, there can be indigenous machinery, and with indigenous machinery, there can be many other industries.

    The person in charge of the Economic Commission said: In order to achieve a greater leap forward in local industry in 1959, the central industrial departments and local industrial departments should closely integrate and support each other under the unified and centralized leadership of the central government, based on the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." At the same time, in addition to ensuring the key points of central construction, in local industry, provinces, cities, autonomous regions, special zones, and counties must not only have a hundred flowers blooming, but also have key points. It is also necessary to grasp the rectification and improvement of the "small indigenous groups" industry, carry out "five determinations", so that the "small indigenous groups" industry will become consolidated and continue to develop to a greater extent.

    两条腿走路日行千里
    一九五八年地方工业大发展，各地重工业比重加大，全国工业布局开始走向均衡，对公社工业化将起巨大的作用
    本报讯　本报记者田林以去年地方工业大跃进的形势和意义为题，访问了国家经济委员会负责人。从这位负责同志的谈话中看出，1958年我国地方工业大跃进的形势和特点，可以用四句话来描绘和概括。这就是：“百花齐放，星斗满天，两腿走路，日行千里。”据初步估算，1958年全国地方工业的产值比去年增长了60％以上。
    这种令人欢欣鼓舞的气象，是各省、市、自治区执行党中央和毛主席提出的以中央工业为纲，中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针的巨大成果。
    1958年，地方工业的构成起了很大的变化。过去地方工业多半只是些轻工业，只生产生活资料；而1958年，除了中央下放的部分重工业以外，各地又自己动手兴办了许多重工业，因而重工业在地方工业中的比重，大大提高，各省、市、自治区大都能生产生产资料了。1958年全国生产的约一千一百万吨钢里面，就约有三百万吨左右是地方钢铁工业中现代化钢铁厂和小的、土的炼钢炉生产出来的。地方工业中的机械工业也有很大发展。单是各地生产的机床，就达到了四万多台。全国还有几万个小煤窑，土水泥窑，只十三个省市投入生产的就有四万多个，生产能力达一百万吨以上。电力、化学肥料、石油等工业也发展了。据初步统计，全国新建的小石油厂有一千四百多个；小电站只辽宁一省，发电能力就达到十二万瓩。地方工业不仅有了这些小型的重工业，而且正在建设着许多大中型工业。如河北、江西、贵州、广西、福建等省、区；正在建设年产六十万吨钢的钢铁厂；内蒙古、广东、云南、陕西等省、区正在建设年产二万吨重型机械设备的机械厂。至于十万瓩以上的电站，则各省市、自治区都在建设。各地在大力发展重工业的同时，也注意发展了与人民生活密切相关的纺织、制糖、酿酒、造纸等轻工业，真是百花齐放，万紫千红，应有尽有。
    过去，我国的工业主要是集中在沿海和内地少数地区，而1958年则是全国各地都大办工业。据估计，今年各省、市、自治区新建的工业单位共达数百万个。这就使我国工业的分布发生了极大的变化。内蒙古、青海、贵州、广西、新疆、福建等省、区，过去工业基础很薄弱，目前这些地区除正在兴建许多大中型工矿企业以外，只是县和专区办的工业企业就已成千上万。在各省和自治区内，工业也不像过去那样只集中在少数大、中城市，而是又在重点城市建设，又比较均衡地分布在各个专区，县城和乡村，犹如“满天星斗”一样。
    地方工业尤其是人民公社工业的发展，对于我国工业化，农业机械化、电气化都将起巨大的作用。冶金工业部在麻城举办的展览会证明，土铁土钢能够作成各种土工作母机和各种土动力机，更能作各种新式农具，还能用来修铁路，造车船。所以有了土钢就可以有土机械，有了土机械，就可以有其他众多的工业。
    经委负责同志说：为了1959年地方工业更大的跃进，中央工业部门和地方工业部门，应当本着“全国一盘棋”的原则，在中央统一集中领导之下，密切结合，互相支援。同时，除了要保证中央建设的重点以外，就是在地方工业中，各省、市、自治区和专、县也要既有百花齐放，又要有重点。还要抓紧“小土群”工业的整顿和提高工作，进行“五定”，使“小土群”工业走向巩固，并得到继续不断的更大的发展。
