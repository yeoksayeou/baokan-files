Fidel Castro
	He is the leader of the Cuban rebel army and the current Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Provisional Government of Cuba. Thirty-two years ago, this hero was born into the family of a sugarcane plantation owner in Oriente Province, southeastern Cuba. He began participating in student movements while studying at university and served as the president of the Student Union of the University of Cuba.
	On July 26, 1953—about a year after the establishment of the Batista dictatorship—Castro led a group of patriotic youths in an armed uprising, attacking the Moncada Barracks in Santiago. The uprising unfortunately failed, and Castro was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. From then on, the anti-dictatorship struggle he led was known as the "July 26th Movement."
	In 1954, Batista, in an attempt to win popular support for the upcoming elections, released political prisoners. Castro was released as a result. After his release, he traveled throughout the country, continuing to organize and promote the anti-dictatorship struggle. Soon after, he went into exile in Mexico, where he trained Cuban patriots in the mountains in preparation for the uprising.
	On December 2, 1956, he led eighty-one comrades back to Cuba, establishing a base in the Sierra Maestra mountains in southwestern Oriente Province and launching a guerrilla war against the dictatorship. With the support of the Cuban people, this small guerrilla force gradually grew stronger in battle and achieved successive victories. On January 1 this year, Batista, seeing that his situation was hopeless, was forced to flee. On January 2, the vanguard of the rebel army led by Castro entered Havana, the capital of Cuba. The Batista dictatorship collapsed, and the Cuban people were victorious. The Cuban Provisional Government, headed by Urrutia, was inaugurated in Havana on January 6. Castro was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces.
Manuel Urrutia
	He is the current President of the Provisional Government of Cuba. Born into a wealthy family in 1902, he and Castro are from the same province, both from Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province.
	Urrutia served as a judge in the Cuban courts for thirty-one years. In December 1956, when the guerrilla force led by Castro landed in Oriente Province, twenty-two people were arrested. Urrutia presided over the trial, and in May 1957, he voted to declare the arrested persons innocent and should be released, saying that the Cuban Constitution allows the people to resist oppression and carry out revolution in any way. As a result, he was dismissed from his post. In April 1957, he was forced into exile in New York and also went to Venezuela. While in exile in the United States, he strongly condemned the United States for transporting arms to support Batista and intercepting ships transporting arms to the Cuban guerrillas. He also pointed out that Batista was not only a tyrant who usurped power but also a lawbreaker and criminal.
	When the armed uprising forces led by Castro announced on December 11, 1958, that they would establish a provisional government, they nominated Urrutia as the President of the Provisional Government. On January 6, Urrutia was officially inaugurated in Havana.
Raúl Castro
	He is one of the leaders of the Cuban rebel army and the younger brother of Fidel Castro, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces. He is twenty-eight years old. He was a participant in the original guerrilla force in Oriente Province. When the second front was opened in Oriente Province at the end of February 1958, he was the commander of the second front. His anti-imperialist attitude is very firm. In a call to the youth of Cuba and other Latin American countries at the end of June 1958, he said: "American imperialism was and still is the greatest scourge, constantly threatening the freedom and sovereignty of the people of Latin American countries, casting a net of unbreakable loans, monopoly capital, and privileges over their heads, hindering the strengthening of the industrial base, and attempting to eliminate the people's movement launched to recover territory or oppose economic penetration." After the Cuban people achieved victory, he advocated resolutely suppressing the criminals of the dictatorial regime and opposing American interference in Cuba's internal affairs.
	Because of Raúl Castro's firm attitude towards imperialism and his dedication to the people's cause, he has won the support and love of the broad masses of the Cuban people. At the million-strong mass rally in Havana on the 21st, Fidel Castro requested that he be appointed as Deputy Commander, which was met with huge cheers from the Cuban people.
Che Guevara
	He is one of the leaders of the Cuban rebel army. He is thirty years old and was born in Argentina. His original profession was as a surgeon, but he has always been concerned about and actively involved in the national liberation movement in Latin America. When he was in Mexico, he met Castro, who was in exile there, and joined the "July 26th Movement." He was also one of the founders of the guerrilla base in Oriente Province. In December 1958, he led the battle in Las Villas Province.
	Guevara firmly opposes American interference in Cuba's internal affairs. Not long ago, he spoke to a reporter from the Argentine newspaper "La Prensa" about Cuba's policy towards the United States, saying: "I think that will depend on the attitude of the (American) State Department towards us, and not on Cuba's attitude." He also said that Cuba will maintain friendly relations with most countries, including the Soviet Union.
	Guevara highly praised the active participation of Cuban farmers in the struggle against the Batista dictatorship. At a press conference, he said, "The peasants played a major role in the revolution. They were the vanguard of the Cuban revolution and have always been a pillar of the revolution. We believe that, according to the minimum requirements of justice, the peasants should get their own thing—land." Guevara also pointed out the necessity of unity as an important factor in the struggle.

    古巴几位领导人
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗
    他是古巴起义军领袖、现任古巴临时政府武装部队总司令。三十二年前，这位英雄人物诞生在古巴东南部奥连特省一个甘蔗园主的家庭里。他在大学里读书时就开始参加学生运动，曾担任过古巴大学学生会主席。
    1953年7月26日——巴蒂斯塔独裁政权成立后一年左右，卡斯特罗曾率领一批爱国青年，举行武装起义，冲向圣地亚哥的蒙卡达军营。起义不幸失败，卡斯特罗被判处十五年徒刑。从此，他所领导的反独裁斗争，被称为“7月26日运动”。
    1954年，巴蒂斯塔为了要举行选举，借释放政治犯来笼络人心，卡斯特罗才得出狱。此后，他即遍走全国各地，继续进行反独裁斗争的组织和宣传工作。不久，他流亡到墨西哥，在墨西哥的山区里训练古巴爱国者作起义的准备。
    1956年12月2日，他率领八十一名战友回到古巴，在奥连特省西南马埃斯特腊山区建立了根据地，发动了反独裁的游击战争。在古巴人民的支持下，这支人数很少的游击队逐渐在战斗中成长壮大起来，并且节节取得胜利。今年1月1日，巴蒂斯塔眼看大势已去，被迫逃亡。1月2日，卡斯特罗领导的起义军先头部队进入古巴首都哈瓦那。巴蒂斯塔独裁政权宣告垮台，古巴人民胜利了。以乌鲁蒂亚为首的古巴临时政府1月6日在哈瓦那宣布就职。卡斯特罗被任命为古巴武装部队总司令。
    曼努埃尔·乌鲁蒂亚
    他是现在的古巴临时政府总统。1902年出生在一个富有之家，他和卡斯特罗是同乡，同是奥连特省省会圣地亚哥人。
    乌鲁蒂亚在古巴法院作了三十一年法官。1956年12月，卡斯特罗领导的游击队在奥连特省登陆时，有二十二人被捕。乌鲁蒂亚主持了这个审判，1957年5月，他曾投票赞成宣布被捕者无罪应予开释，他说，古巴宪法允许人民用任何方式反抗压迫，进行革命。为此，他被解除职务。1957年4月他被迫流亡到纽约，还曾到过委内瑞拉。他在美国流亡时曾强烈谴责美国运军火支持巴蒂斯塔和拦劫给古巴游击队运送军火的船只。他还指出，巴蒂斯塔不仅是一个篡夺政权的暴君，而且是一个违法者和罪犯。
    当卡斯特罗领导的武装起义部队于1958年12月11日宣布将成立临时政府时，提名乌鲁蒂亚为临时政府总统。1月6日，乌鲁蒂亚在哈瓦那正式就职。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗
    他是古巴起义部队的领导人之一，现任古巴武装部队总司令菲德尔·卡斯特罗的弟弟。现年二十八岁。他是奥连特省最初的游击队的参加者。当1958年2月底，在奥连特省开辟第二战线的时候，他是第二战线的司令。他的反帝态度是很坚决的。在1958年6月底他向古巴、拉丁美洲各国青年发出的呼吁书中曾说过：“美帝国主义从前是，现在仍然是最大的祸害，它经常威胁拉丁美洲各国人民的自由和主权，在他们头上撒下了难以冲破的贷款、垄断资本和特权的罗网，阻挠工业基础的加强，企图消灭为收复领土或反对经济渗透而展开的人民运动”。在古巴人民取得胜利后，他主张坚决镇压独裁政权的罪犯，反对美国干涉古巴内政。
    由于劳尔·卡斯特罗对帝国主义的坚决态度和对人民事业的献身精神，因此得到古巴广大人民的拥护和爱戴。菲德尔·卡斯特罗21日在哈瓦那百万群众大会上曾要求任命他为副司令，当时古巴人民用巨大的欢呼声表示赞同。
    格瓦拉
    他是古巴起义部队的领导人之一，现年三十岁，出生于阿根廷，本来的职业是外科医生，但是一向关怀并且积极从事拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。当他在墨西哥时遇见了流亡在那里的卡斯特罗，并且参加了“7月26日运动”，他也是奥连特省游击根据地创建人之一。1958年12月，他领导了拉斯维利亚斯省的战役。
    格瓦拉坚决反对美国干涉古巴内政。不久前，他曾对阿根廷报纸“新闻报”记者谈到古巴对美国的政策，他说：“我认为，那将取决于（美国）国务院对我们的态度，而不是取决于古巴的态度”。他还说，古巴将和包括苏联在内的大多数国家保持友好。
    格瓦拉对于古巴农民积极参与这次反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的斗争给予很高的评价。他在一次记者招待会上说过，“农民在革命中起了主要作用。他们是古巴革命的先锋队，并且一直是革命的一个支柱。我们认为，根据起码的公正要求，农民应获得自己的东西——土地”。格瓦拉还指出了团结一致作为斗争的重要因素的必要性。
