Seeing the Powerful Vitality of People's Communes From One Commune
In the eight months since its establishment, the Zhangshi Commune's grain production has tripled, over a hundred factories have been built, commodity production has developed rapidly, income has greatly increased, and living standards are good.

(Our Guangzhou dispatch, 12th) The Zhangshi People's Commune (formerly Zhangshi Township) in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, is an ordinary commune among the province's more than 700 people's communes. In the eight months since its birth, the various production undertakings of this commune have achieved great development, demonstrating the powerful vitality of the people's commune like a rising sun. The total output value in 1958 increased more than four times compared with the year before the establishment of the commune. The total value of industrial and agricultural output reached more than 13 million yuan, and after deducting 40% for costs, the average net income per person was about 400 yuan.

In just a few months, the Zhangshi People's Commune was not only able to repay in one go the more than 400,000 yuan in state loans that the agricultural cooperatives had been unable to repay for several years, but also invested in expanding industrial and agricultural production, and raised the living standards of all members beyond those of well-to-do middle peasants. Of the average net income of 400 yuan per person per year, if 65% is used for accumulation and 35% for consumption, each person will have 140 yuan per year, or more than 11 yuan per month. Before November last year, the commune provided each person with free meals worth more than 7 yuan per month, and wages for each laborer were also paid monthly. The remainder was intended to cover clothing, daily necessities, schooling, entertainment, and collective welfare expenses. After recent research, the commune party committee felt that the allowance was too high and planned to change it to 6 yuan per month for food, with the remainder being paid as wages. In this way, each laborer will have an average monthly wage of 10 yuan. The commune's current deposits and goods awaiting sale are sufficient to pay the wages of all laborers for one year.

The Zhangshi People's Commune is a poor area with high mountains, dense forests, cold water, infertile land, and inconvenient transportation, which has always been considered a place where "no one wants to live, and women drift to other rivers." In the few years after liberation, production and life had undergone great changes, but it was not prosperous. For example, in 1957, the average per capita grain ration in Zhangshi Township was only 370 catties of rice, and the average total income (before deducting costs) was only 91.5 yuan. Many agricultural cooperatives also had overspending households. However, since the establishment of the commune last April (called the Township Joint Cooperative before September last year), which merged the original eight agricultural cooperatives and the handicraft cooperative and residents of Zhangshi Street, totaling 4,625 households (24,518 people), the production outlook of the entire commune has been completely renewed. This is due to the large number of people and the correct implementation of the production policy of focusing on grain, simultaneously developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficiency production and commodity production. Last year, the average yield per mu of 25,000 mu of late rice reached 1,717 catties, an increase of more than six times compared with the yield of 219 catties per mu of late rice in 1957 (total grain production increased more than three times compared with 1957), with an average of about 3,000 catties of grain per person per year. Simultaneously with the leap forward in grain production, the yield per mu of 3,500 mu of peanuts was 600 catties, also an increase of more than three times compared with the yield of 144 catties per mu in 1957. Other areas such as chicken, pig, and fish farming have also developed greatly. In terms of industrial development, the commune has newly built and renovated a total of 122 large and small factories for fertilizer, agricultural tools, building materials, agricultural product processing, food processing, mining, iron smelting, shipbuilding, hydropower generation, and logging, with a total industrial output value of 2.1 million yuan, an increase of 13 times compared with the total industrial output value of more than 150,000 yuan in 1957. The output value of forestry and forest by-products reached 2.87 million yuan. In addition to doing a good job in self-sufficient production, the commune also vigorously promoted commodity production. The commune sold commodities such as timber, limestone, charcoal, firewood, bricks, tiles, lime, live pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and grain, accounting for about one-third of the total output value. With the needs of production development, the entire commune also built seven new roads, stretching 80 li in length, and now most production management areas can be directly accessed by cars.

The Zhangshi Commune did not have good original conditions, and after its establishment, it was busy with various production tasks. There were still many problems in organization, systems, and management, and there was no time to improve and rectify them. It has also not received special care from the state in terms of human and financial resources. Under these circumstances, it was able to achieve a comprehensive and extremely high-speed leap forward only because of the preliminary play of the commune's advantages in various aspects. The establishment of the Zhangshi Commune first expanded and improved the means of production that were originally scattered among the eight agricultural cooperatives to be owned by the people of the entire commune, and the 8,500 laborers in the entire township were also organized together. This change in production relations largely solved the shortcomings of the past agricultural cooperatives in terms of scattered resources and scattered labor, which could not be allocated and utilized more rationally and effectively, thus greatly promoting the overall development of production. For example, the commune's jurisdiction originally had abundant natural resources such as forests and limestone. The continuous high mountains in the Liukengshan area alone, stretching for 200 li, contain about 1 million cubic meters of timber, but the few small agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous area had few people and were unable to exploit the forests. The agricultural cooperatives in the plain area had more labor but no forests to exploit. After the establishment of the people's commune, these problems were solved at once. The commune has a total of 8,500 laborers, and it is not difficult to draw appropriate forces to cut wood. The commune has now established a logging and processing plant with more than 700 people. In just over a month, it has cut down timber worth more than 45,000 yuan, and mobilized members to build roads and dredge rivers, using cars and rafts to transport the timber out. After the establishment of the commune, due to its "large" and "public" nature, the previously scattered resources such as mountain ponds, rivers, and mountain stones have also been used more rationally. For example, the more than 10,000 mu of mountain ponds and rivers in the entire township were previously owned by various small cooperatives, and no one had the right or ability to use them comprehensively. Only after the establishment of the commune can they be uniformly arranged and changed into 10,000 mu of fish ponds, raising 1 million catties of fish. When the commune draws labor, it rationally arranges them according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and organizes various professional teams, thus ensuring the comprehensive development of grain, diversified operations, and industrial production.

After the establishment of the Zhangshi Commune, due to the large-scale construction of 251 public canteens and 27 nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly, not only were the elderly cared for and the young educated, but also a large number of women were liberated from household labor and went to industrial and agricultural production posts. This made it possible for women to immediately take over the work of the men who had been transferred to the mountains to cut wood and blast rocks on the agricultural production front.

Because of the "large" and "public" nature of the commune, and the integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, various undertakings of the Zhangshi People's Commune have also been closely combined and mutually supported, promoting the faster development of various undertakings. In the past, Zhangshi Township had no industry, and agricultural production often lacked production funds, which could not be solved and had to be borrowed from the state. In recent years after liberation, the various loans borrowed from the state, only the unreturned portion amounted to more than 400,000 yuan. But after the establishment of the commune, this situation has fundamentally changed. When there was a lack of funds during the spring plowing last year, the commune's (then called Township Joint Cooperative) logging yard fought for more than a month and raised more than 45,000 yuan for agricultural production, providing timely support for agricultural production. In July, in order to improve labor efficiency, the logging yard wanted to install an aerial transportation line, but there was no money to buy steel cables, and the cut wood could not be transported out for a while. At that time, the commune mobilized more than 5,000 members from various production fronts to Liukengshan, and in one day and one night, they transported out more than 170,000 pieces of wood, worth more than 30,000 yuan, and bought back the equipment needed for aerial transportation.

On the basis of the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Zhangshi Commune implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply. In terms of the supply system, it implemented free meals, guaranteeing three meals of dry rice every day. Some canteens also provided two dishes and one soup per meal, and free medical treatment and medicine. In terms of the wage system, since the formal payment of wages in September 1958, three payments have been made, totaling more than 182,000 yuan. At present, the commune is also building hospitals and public places in Zhangshi Market. After the members increased their income, their purchasing power has increased significantly. According to statistics in November 1958, the sales of living materials in the three market towns of Zhangshi, Baisha, and Luokeng reached more than 240,000 yuan, an increase of about six times compared with the 36,400 yuan in the same period in 1957. Savings have also generally increased. As of December 20, 1958, the commune's credit cooperative had a total of 845,100 yuan in deposits, of which one-third belonged to the members' deposits, an increase of more than five times compared with the deposits of 45,621 yuan in the same period in 1957.

The members of the Zhangshi People's Commune have deeply realized the benefits of the people's commune through personal experience and know that with the development of industrial and agricultural production, their lives will continue to improve greatly. (Attached pictures)

### 从一个公社看人民公社的强大生命力

    初升太阳光芒万丈　一大二公好处无穷
    从一个公社看人民公社的强大生命力
    樟市公社诞生八个月，粮食产量增三倍，工厂建起百多座，商品生产发展快，收入大增生活好
    本报广州12日电　广东省韶关市郊区樟市人民公社（原樟市乡），是全省七百多个人民公社中的一个普通的公社。这个公社诞生八个月来，各项生产事业获得了极大的发展，像初升的太阳一样，显示了人民公社的强大生命力。1958年生产总值比公社成立前一年增加四倍多，工业和农业总产值达到一千三百多万元，除去40％的成本外，平均每人纯收入约四百元。
    樟市人民公社在短短几个月中，不仅有能力一举清还了过去几年来农业社无力归还的四十多万元国家贷款，还投资扩大了工农业生产，并且使全体社员的生活水平超过了富裕中农。平均每人每年纯收入的四百元中，如以65％作积累，35％用作消费，每人每年有一百四十元，每月十一元多。公社在去年11月份以前，每个人每月由公社免费供给七元多的伙食，每个劳动力的工资也按月发放，其余准备用作衣服、日用品、读书、文娱及集体福利费的包干。公社党委最近经过研究，认为包得太多了，准备改为每人每月伙食费六元，其余作为工资发放。这样，每个劳动力每月平均将有工资十元。公社目前手中的存款和待售物资，还足够发放全体劳动力一年的工资。
    樟市人民公社，是一个山高、林密、水冷、田瘦、交通不便、向来被认为是“无人肯住，妇女漂外江”的穷地方。解放后几年来，生产、生活已经有了很大改变，但是并不富裕。如1957年樟市乡平均每人的口粮只有三百七十斤稻谷，平均总收入（未除去成本）只有九十一点五元。各个农业社还出现了不少的超支户。但是去年4月一成立了公社（去年9月前叫乡联社），把原先的八个农业社和樟市街的手工业合作社及居民等四千六百二十五户（共二万四千五百一十八人）合并起来以后，由于人多势众，并且正确地贯彻了以粮食为主和农林牧副渔业同时并举、工业和农业同时并举、自给生产和商品生产同时并举的生产方针，使全社生产面貌焕然一新。去年二万五千多亩晚稻平均亩产达到一千七百十七斤，比1957年晚稻亩产量二百一十九斤增产六倍多（全年粮食比1957年增产三倍多），平均每人全年约有粮食三千多斤。与粮食生产跃进的同时，三千五百多亩花生亩产六百斤，也比1957年的亩产一百四十四斤增加三倍多；其它如养鸡、养猪、养鱼都有很大发展。公社兴办工业方面，新建和修建了肥料、农具、建筑材料、农产品加工、食品加工、采矿、炼铁、造船、水力发电及伐木等各种大小工厂共一百二十二座，工业总产值达到二百一十万元，比1957年的工业总产值十五万多元增长了十三倍。林业和林副产品产值达到二百八十七万元。公社除了搞好自给性生产外，还大抓商品性生产，公社卖出的木材、石灰石、木炭、木柴、砖瓦、石灰、生猪、鸡、鸭、鹅和粮食等商品，约占总产值三分之一。随着生产发展的需要，全社一年内还新建了七条公路，长达八十华里，现在大部分生产管理区都可直通汽车。
    樟市公社原有条件并不好，建成后又忙于各项生产工作，组织、制度、经营管理等都存在不少问题，还来不及健全、整顿；在人力财力方面也没有得到国家的特别照顾。在这种情况下，它能够获得全面的极高速度的跃进，只是由于初步发挥了公社的各方面的优越性的结果。樟市公社的建立，首先使原来分散属于八个农业社的生产资料，扩大和提高为全公社人民所有，全乡的八千五百个劳动力也组织到一起了。这种生产关系的改变，在很大程度上解决了过去农业社资源分散、劳动力分散，不能更合理更有效地调配和利用的缺点，因此大大促进了生产的全面发展。例如，公社辖区内，本来有丰富的森林、石灰石等自然资源，仅留坑山一带二百华里的崇山峻岭，就蕴藏着一百万立方公尺左右的木材，但过去山区的几个小农业社，人力少，无力开采林木；而平原地区的农业社劳力较多，却没有林木可供开采。人民公社成立以后，这些问题一下子便解决了。公社共有八千五百个劳动力，从中抽调适当力量伐木并不感到大的困难。公社现在成立了七百多人的伐木加工场，仅仅一月多时间，就砍伐了价值四万五千多元的木材，并发动社员修建公路、疏通河道，用汽车运输和放木排的办法使木材得以源源外运。公社建立后由于“大”和“公”，使过去分散的山塘、河流、山石等资源，也得到了更合理的利用。如全乡的一万多亩的山塘、河流，过去分别属于各个小社所有，谁也无权无能综合利用，公社建立后才能统一安排，改为万亩鱼塘，养鱼一百万斤。公社在抽调劳动力时，因为按照工农业生产的需要，进行合理安排，分别组织了各种专业队伍，因此保证了粮食、多种经营和工业生产的全面发展。
    樟市公社建立后，由于大举兴办了公共食堂二百五十一所，托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院二十七所，不但使老有所养，幼有所教，而且使大批妇女得以从家务劳动中解放出来，走上工农业生产岗位。这就使得大批原来农业生产战线上的男人抽调上山砍木和爆石后，可以由妇女立即接替他们的工作。
    因为公社的“大”和“公”，工农商学兵五位一体，樟市人民公社各项事业也得到了密切结合和互相支援，促进了各项事业的更快的发展。过去，樟市乡没有什么工业，农业生产往往缺乏生产资金，无法解决，只得向国家贷款，解放后历年来向国家借的各种贷款，仅未归还部分就达四十多万元。但公社建立后，这种情况根本改变了。去年春耕时缺乏资金，公社（当时叫乡联社）的伐木场奋战一个多月，就为农业生产筹足了四万五千多元的资金，及时支援了农业生产。7月间，伐木场为了提高劳动效率，要安装一条空中运输线，但没有资金购买钢索，伐了的木材一时又运不出去。当时，公社便从各条生产战线动员了五千多社员开赴留坑山，一天一夜就运出木材十七万多条，价值三万多元，买回了空中运输所需的装备。
    樟市公社在工农业生产获得了全面大跃进的基础上，实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，供给制方面，实行了吃饭不要钱，一日保证三餐大米干饭，有些食堂也做到每餐两菜一汤，医病吃药不要钱。工资制方面，从1958年9月正式发放工资以来，已发放了三次，共十八万二千多元。目前，公社还在樟市墟上建筑医院和公共场所。社员增加收入以后，购买力显著提高了，据1958年11月的统计，樟市、白沙、罗坑三个墟场销售的生活资料共达二十四万多元，比1957年同期的三万六千四百元增加了约六倍。储蓄也普遍增加，到1958年12月20日，公社信用社的存款共八十四万五千一百元，其中属于社员的存款占三分之一，比1957年同期的存款四万五千六百二十一元，增加了五倍多。
    樟市人民公社的社员在亲身感受中，已经深深地体会到人民公社的好处；并且知道随着工农业生产的发展，他们的生活将要继续大大改善。（附图片）
