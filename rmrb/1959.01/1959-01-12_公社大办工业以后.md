After the Communes Vigorously Develop Industry
Chen Min, Zhou Meixue

Gaotang County is located in the northwest plains of Shandong, and has historically been a major producer of cotton, with abundant grain, potato crops and other agricultural resources, making it suitable for developing industry, especially light industry and the textile industry. In late October of last year, based on the favorable conditions of an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain and cotton, and the increasing demand for industry after the rural communes were established, the county party committee launched a mass movement to vigorously develop people's commune industries, building upon some of the township and commune industries established in the first half of the year. After a short forty days of effort, the eight people's communes newly built and expanded 181 medium and small factories. These included 37 projects such as machinery, wood processing, textiles, paper making, alcohol, sugar refining, oil pressing, glass, leather, grain processing, and sewing. Since these factories were built, they have brought many benefits in supporting agricultural production, improving the lives of commune members, and making full use of resources.

The vigorous development of industry by the communes provides the material conditions to satisfy people's needs in life and culture. Although Gaotang County has relatively abundant agricultural resources that can be used as industrial raw materials, in the past, more than 90% of the cloth people wore, the paper they used, and the sugar and oil they ate relied on imports from other places. In the first half of last year, the county built a cotton processing plant, but the cotton seeds that were ginned still had to be sent to other places to be pressed for oil. This not only failed to better supply people's life needs, but also caused much waste in manpower and materials due to the two-way transportation of raw materials and finished products. From the perspective of living consumption levels, in the past, each person consumed an average of three and a half jin of edible vegetable oil and five jin of pastries per year. According to the production capacity of the newly built factories, the average possession of various products per person per year will be greatly increased. Edible oil can reach 39.6 jin, and pastries and bread can reach more than 140 jin. In 1957, each person used an average of five liang of paper. After the paper mill built this time is in normal production, the average possession per person can reach 35 jin. Although not many textile factories have been built at present, the average possession of cotton cloth per person has reached 25 chi. In addition to some products being allocated by the state to support other places, many products are already self-sufficient and no longer need to be transported from cities hundreds of miles away.

The vigorous development of industry by the communes can gradually replace manual labor with machines, saving a large amount of labor, especially further liberating women's labor and supporting industrial and agricultural production. In the past, the eight people's communes in Gaotang County used manual labor to grind flour, make shoes, and make clothes. It is estimated that more than 20,000 people and more than 2,400 animal power were needed to do these jobs every year. After the industrial development, the stone mill was powered, the soles of shoes were made with bottoming machines, and clothes and shoe uppers were made with sewing machines, which only required more than 3,900 people. After the sewing factory was built, the women happily composed songs to praise: "The establishment of the sewing factory makes women very happy. They can make single-layered and quilted clothes, and sew torn and worn clothes. Freeing up their bodies to engage in production, thoroughly liberating themselves!"

The industrial development by the communes is conducive to fully utilizing various resources and increasing wealth for society. Centering on the comprehensive utilization of sweet potatoes, Gaotang County has built factories for white wine, alcohol, starch, and food. The county is also planning to build a butadiene-sodium rubber factory. The starch factory can make vermicelli, starch sheets and other various non-staple foods, and the food factory has made many kinds of sweet potato snacks. The alcohol made from sweet potatoes can replace gasoline to provide fuel for machines, or the alcohol can be used to make synthetic rubber to provide raw materials for the rubber factory. Centering on the comprehensive utilization of cotton, Gaotang County has established a series of factories such as ginning, textile, knitting, oil pressing, furfural, degumming, and rope making. Cotton is used to spin yarn and weave cloth, make socks, towels, headscarves and other various knitwear, cotton seeds are used to press oil, peel short lint, cotton seed hulls are used to make furfural; cotton stalks are degummed and used to make ropes, and so on. Almost every part of a cotton plant, from root to tip, is utilized.

After the industry was developed, it created conditions for agricultural production to move towards mechanization, and promoted the development of agricultural production. In the first half of last year, in the movement to vigorously develop township and commune industries, Gaotang County established a group of small factories mainly serving agricultural production, such as machinery, ironware, wood industry, and granular fertilizer, manufacturing and repairing many simple lathes, farm tools, transportation tools, water lifting tools, ball bearings and other products. This played an important role in promoting a bumper agricultural harvest. In the second half of the year, Gaotang County appropriately expanded and renovated these factories. If the expanded machinery factory and wood processing factory manufacture all farm tools, they can provide more than 5.5 million pieces of various farm tools for agriculture every year. At present, the county-run machinery factory has begun to produce power equipment such as internal combustion engines and gas generators, and the commune's machinery factory is also trying to produce these products. This will greatly improve production efficiency, save labor, and create conditions for agriculture to gradually transition from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization.

The vigorous development of industry by the communes has also strengthened the working class and cultivated a large number of new technical forces. Gaotang County has trained nearly 2,000 technical personnel of various types.

The proportion of total industrial and agricultural output value in the county has also changed greatly. In 1957, the total agricultural output value of the county was 50.14 million yuan, and the industrial output value was only 4.67 million yuan, with the industrial output value accounting for only 8.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. After this vigorous development of industry, the annual industrial output value is expected to reach 206 million yuan, an increase of 43 times compared with 1957, and the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value has jumped to more than 47%. In addition to a portion of the industrial products of the communes being distributed for consumption by the communes, a portion of the products such as yarn, cloth, leather, and edible oil are distributed by the state under a unified plan, and other products such as sugar, alcohol, glass, simple lathes, and some agricultural machinery are allocated by the county federation of cooperatives. This has increased the proportion of ownership by the whole people in the communes. With the progress of industrialization of the communes, the improvement of material conditions, science and culture will become more popular, and people's political awareness will gradually increase, and the entire rural spiritual outlook will undergo profound changes.

    公社大办工业以后
    陈敏　周梅雪
    高唐县位于鲁西北平原，历来盛产棉花，粮食、薯类等作物也不少，农业资源相当丰富，适宜于发展工业，尤其是轻工业和纺织工业。去年10月下旬，县委根据粮棉空前丰收的有利条件，以及农村公社化以后对工业越来越多的要求，在上半年办起的一些乡社工业的基础上，掀起了大办人民公社工业的群众运动。经过短短四十天的努力，八个人民公社新建和扩建了中、小型工厂一百八十一个。其中包括机械、木材加工、纺织、造纸、酒精、制糖、榨油、玻璃、皮革、粮食加工、缝纫等三十七个项目。这批工厂建起来以后，在支援农业生产、改善社员生活以及充分利用资源等方面，都带来了很多好处。
    公社大办工业，为满足人民的生活和文化方面的需要提供了物质条件。高唐县可以供作工业原料的农业资源虽然相当丰富，但是过去人们穿的布、用的纸张以及吃的糖、油等，90％以上都依赖外地调进。去年上半年，县里建了棉花加工厂，但是轧下来的棉籽还要送到外地去榨油。这样不但不能更好地供应人民的生活需要，还因原料成品的相向运输，在人力、物力方面造成许多浪费。从生活消费水平看，以往每人每年平均消费三斤十二两食用植物油，五斤糕点。按照新建工厂的生产能力计算，各项产品每人每年的平均占有量将大大提高。食油可达三十九斤六两，糕点、面包一百四十斤以上。1957年每人平均用纸张五两，这次建成的纸厂正常生产以后，每人平均占有量可以达到三十五斤。目前纺织厂虽然建得还不多，但是棉布每人平均占有量已达二十五市尺。除了有一部分产品将由国家统一调配支援外地外，许多产品已能自给自足，不必再从数百里外的城市运来。
    公社大办工业，可以用机器逐步代替手工操作，节省出大批劳动力，特别是可以进一步解放妇女劳动力，支援工农业生产。高唐县八个人民公社，过去都用人工磨面，做鞋，做衣服，估计每年需要二万多人和二千四百多头畜力干这些活。办工业以后，实现了石磨动力化，用纳底机做鞋底，用缝纫机做衣服、鞋帮，干这些活的只要三千九百多人就够了。建起缝纫厂以后，妇女们高兴地编歌谣歌颂说：“建立缝纫厂，妇女多喜欢。能作单夹棉，又缝破和烂。腾出身来搞生产，彻底把身翻！”
    公社办工业有利于充分利用各种资源，为社会增加财富。高唐县以综合利用甘薯为中心，建起了白酒、酒精、淀粉、食品等工厂，县里还正在筹建丁钠橡胶厂。淀粉厂能做粉丝、粉皮等各种副食品，食品厂做出了许多种花样的甘薯点心。用甘薯做的酒精，可以代替汽油，为机器提供燃料，或者用酒精做合成橡胶，为橡胶厂提供原料。围绕棉花的综合利用，高唐县建立了轧花、纺织、针织、榨油、糠醛、脱胶、打绳等一系列的工厂。棉花用来纺纱织布，制袜子、毛巾、头巾等各种针织品、棉籽用来榨油，剥短绒，棉籽壳制糠醛；棉秆皮脱胶打绳，等等。一棵棉花，从根到梢差不多都被利用起来了。
    工业办起来以后，为农业生产走向机械化创造了条件，促进了农业生产的发展。去年上半年，高唐县在大办乡社工业的运动中，建立了一批主要为农业生产服务的机械、铁业、木业、颗粒肥料等小型工厂，制造和修配了许多简易车床、农具、运输工具、提水工具、滚珠轴承等产品。这对促进农业大丰收起了重要的作用。下半年高唐县又把这些工厂适当地加以扩建和改建。扩建后的机械工厂和木材加工厂，如果全部制造农具，每年就可以为农业提供各式农具五百五十多万件。目前，县营机械厂已经开始生产内燃机、煤汽机等动力设备，公社的机械厂也在试制这些产品。这将大大提高生产效率，节省劳动力，并为农业由手工操作逐步过渡到半机械化机械化，创造条件。
    公社大办工业还壮大了工人阶级队伍，培养了大批新技术力量。高唐县已经训练出各种技术人才近二千名。
    全县工农业产值的比重也有了很大变化。1957年，全县农业产值为五千零一十四万元，工业产值仅有四百六十七万元，工业产值只占工农业总产值的8.5％。这次大办工业以后，全年工业产值预计可达二亿零六百万元，比1957年提高了四十三倍，工业产值在工农业总产值中所占的比重一下跳到47％以上。公社的工业产品除有一部分归公社分配消费外，有一部分如纱布、皮革、食油等由国家统一计划分配，另外一些产品如糖、酒精、玻璃、简易车床，部分农业机械等，由县联社统一调配。这就增加了公社中全民所有制的成份。随着公社工业化的进展，物质条件的改善，科学文化将更加普及，人们的政治觉悟必将逐步提高，整个农村的精神面貌将起深刻变化。
