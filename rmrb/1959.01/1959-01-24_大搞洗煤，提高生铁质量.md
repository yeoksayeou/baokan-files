Vigorously Develop Coal Washing to Improve Pig Iron Quality
Commentator of this newspaper

Pig iron with high sulfur content produces steel that is brittle and difficult to roll into materials. Therefore, to improve the quality of pig iron, the main task is to reduce its sulfur content.

Almost all the sulfur content in pig iron comes from raw materials and fuel. The sulfur from fuel (coke) accounts for about 80% to 90%, and the sulfur from raw materials (ore) accounts for about 10% to 20%. It is evident that reducing the sulfur content of coke can significantly reduce the sulfur content of pig iron.

To reduce the sulfur content of coke, we must first reduce the sulfur content of the raw material for coke – coal. Because about 50% to 60% of the sulfur content of coal transfers to coke during coking, and about 40% transfers to coal gas. To reduce the sulfur content of coking coal, the coal must be washed and sorted before coking. Therefore, coal washing is a crucial key to improving the quality of pig iron.

In 1958, China's coal washing capacity greatly increased, but because the development speed of iron and steel production was even faster, the existing coal washing capacity cannot yet meet the needs of the objective situation.

To increase coal washing capacity, existing coal washing plants should thoroughly mobilize the masses and launch a great technical revolution to fully utilize their production potential. For example, adopting heavy medium coal washing and promoting the experience of changing the vertical air valves of jigging machines to horizontal air valves can greatly increase coal washing capacity. According to the results of trial use of horizontal air valves in Benxi, Beipiao, Pingxiang, Kailuan, and other places, the washing capacity of coal washing machines can be increased by 50% to 100%. Secondly, appropriately renovating existing coal washing plants is also a quick and effective way to improve coal washing capacity. Currently, some coal washing plants do not have their coal washing capacity fully utilized due to insufficient capacity in transportation and other auxiliary workshops. If these weak links are renovated as needed, coal washing capacity can be greatly improved.

In addition to fully utilizing the production potential of existing coal washing plants to improve coal washing capacity, we must also accelerate the construction of new coal washing plants so that they can be put into production as soon as possible. Coal washing plants under construction should be completed as early as possible. In particular, large-scale coal washing plants in Zhuzhou, Matou, Handan, Taiyuan, Jiexiu, Baotou, and other places should take measures to put them into production several months ahead of schedule.

However, relying solely on the construction of large and medium-sized modern coal washing plants cannot quickly meet objective needs. Therefore, in the construction of coal washing plants, we must also implement the policy of "simultaneous development of large, medium, and small-sized plants" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods," and build a large number of simple coal washing plants.

Simple coal washing plants are not only quick to build and require less investment, but also require less steel, and equipment and materials are easy to obtain. To build a modern coal washing plant with an annual capacity of one million tons of raw coal, approximately 25 tons of steel are required per 10,000 tons of capacity, and it generally takes two years to build, with an investment of 3 to 3.5 yuan per ton of capacity. However, to build a simple coal washing plant with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons of raw coal, only 2 tons of steel are required per 10,000 tons of capacity, and it can be built in a few months, with an investment of 1 yuan per ton of capacity. Moreover, the investment can be quickly recovered after it is put into production. For example, the simple coal washing plant built by the Huainan Mining Bureau, with an annual capacity of 600,000 tons of raw coal, only used 25 tons of steel including equipment, and was completed in one month, with an investment of only 0.15 yuan per ton of capacity. As another example, the Taozhuang Simple Coal Washing Plant in Shandong Province, with an annual capacity of 350,000 tons of raw coal, only used 50 kilograms of reinforcing steel, 35 tons of cement, 160 cubic meters of wood, and 100,000 blue bricks; the equipment was also very simple, weighing only 5.8 tons; the total investment was 165,000 yuan. During construction, due to the use of a three-dimensional cross-parallel operation fast construction method, the construction time (including design) was only 25 days.

In a large number of small coal mines, all small coal mines that produce coking coal should adopt simple and easy-to-implement indigenous methods for coal washing. Various simple coal washing methods have now been created in various regions, such as washing with water ditches, using wooden coal washing troughs, and wooden jigging coal washing machines. These are highly efficient, require little investment, are not complicated to operate, are easy to master, and are suitable for promotion.

    大搞洗煤，提高生铁质量
    本报评论员
    含硫量高的生铁，炼成的钢很脆，不易轧成材。因此，要提高生铁的质量，主要的就是要降低生铁的含硫量。
    生铁的含硫量几乎全部是从原料和燃料中带来的。其中由燃料（焦炭）带来的硫量约占80％到90％，由原料（矿石）带来的硫量约占10％到20％。可见，降低焦炭的含硫量，就可以大大地降低生铁的含硫量。
    要降低焦炭的含硫量，首先应该降低焦炭的原料——煤的含硫量。因为煤的含硫量在炼焦时约有50％到60％转入焦炭，40％左右转入煤气。而要降低炼焦煤的含硫量，就必须把煤洗一洗，选一选，然后再去炼焦。所以说，洗煤是提高生铁质量的重要关键。
    1958年我国的洗煤能力有了很大的增长，但是，由于钢铁生产的发展速度更快，现有洗煤能力还不能满足客观形势的需要。
    为了增加洗煤能力，现有洗煤厂应该深入发动群众，大闹技术革命，充分发挥生产潜力。例如，采用重介质洗煤和推广把跳汰机的立式风阀改为卧式风阀的经验，都可大大提高洗煤能力。根据本溪、北票、萍乡、开滦等地试用卧式风阀的结果，洗煤机的洗选能力可以提高50％到100％。其次，对现有洗煤厂进行适当的改建，也是提高洗煤能力的一种立竿见影的办法。目前有些洗煤厂，由于装运和其他辅助车间的能力不足，以致洗煤机的洗选能力还没有充分发挥，如果对这些薄弱环节进行必要的改建，就可以大大提高洗煤能力。
    提高洗煤能力，除了充分发挥现有洗煤厂的生产潜力以外，还要加快建设新的洗煤厂，使之尽早地投入生产。正在施工的洗煤厂，应该尽可能地提早完工。特别是株洲、马头、邯郸、太原、介休、包头等大型洗煤厂，应该采取措施，争取提前几个月投入生产。
    但是，只靠建设大中型的现代化的洗煤厂是不能很快满足客观需要的。因此，在洗煤厂的建设上，也要贯彻执行“大中小并举”和“土洋并举”的方针，大量地建设简易洗煤厂。
    简易洗煤厂不但建设快，投资少，而且需要的钢材少，设备、材料都容易解决。建设一个年洗原煤一百万吨的现代化的洗煤厂，每万吨能力约需钢材二十五吨，一般需要两年才能建成，每吨能力需要投资三元到三元五角。而建设一个年洗原煤三十万吨的简易洗煤厂，每万吨能力仅需钢材两吨，几个月就可以建成，每吨能力投资一元，而且在投入生产以后，很快就可以收回投资。例如，淮南矿务局建设的年洗原煤六十万吨的简易洗煤厂，连设备在内，一共只用钢材二十五吨，一个月就建成，每吨能力投资仅一角五分。又如山东省陶庄简易洗煤厂，年洗原煤三十五万吨，仅用五十公斤钢筋、三十五吨水泥、一百六十立方公尺木材、十万块青砖；设备也很简单，仅重五点八吨；投资共为十六万五千元。在施工中由于采用了立体交叉平行作业快速施工法，建厂时间（包括设计在内）仅为二十五天。
    在大量的小煤窑中，凡是生产炼焦煤的小煤窑，都应该采取简单易行的土办法来洗煤。现在各地已经创造出各种各样的简易洗煤法，如用水沟冲洗、用木制洗煤槽和木制跳汰洗煤机等，效率较高，投资不大，操作也不复杂，容易掌握，宜于推广。
