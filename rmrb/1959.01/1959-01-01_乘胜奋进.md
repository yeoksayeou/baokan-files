    Pressing Forward in Victory
    Pan Zinian
    1958 was the first year of three years of hard struggle, and also the first year of hard struggle for philosophy and social science work. In this year, philosophy and social science workers went through the following battles: first, the rectification and anti-rightist campaign. Then came going down to the countryside and up to the mountains for labor training; cursory observation and in-depth investigation, learning from the working people. Then came rectification study sessions, criticizing bourgeois academic viewpoints and research methods. Then came collective writing; going down to the countryside and factories to cultivate experimental plots. The results of these battles were considerable. The anti-rightist struggle eliminated many bourgeois rightists mixed in the scientific ranks, achieving a decisive victory on the political and ideological fronts. Rectification, especially rectification study sessions, clarified the boundaries between the two roads and two methods in scientific work, achieving further victory on the ideological front, thereby clarifying the direction and line of scientific work—that the research work of philosophy and social sciences must serve the politics of the working class and must follow the mass line. Collective writing achieved extremely great results, with the vast number of young teachers and students writing all kinds of works ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of words in a relatively short period of time through arduous efforts. Cultivating experimental plots has also yielded some experience, providing a good start for implementing the new direction and line.
    In 1959, the philosophy and social science departments, like other departments, will continue to be a year of great leap forward. Researchers in various disciplines of philosophy and social science departments have been actively drafting their plans for hard struggle. These plans, due to the different circumstances of each discipline, are not very similar to each other, or even very different; but generally speaking, they do not go beyond the following points. One is to vigorously study the main documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, study the main theoretical problems in socialism and communism and in real life, and theoretically elaborate the Party's various policies and guidelines, in order to help with the publicity and education of socialism and communism. One is to further criticize bourgeois academic thought, and hoist the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high on every work post in each discipline. One is to work hard on writing and compiling materials to present as a gift for the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. One is to rectify the scientific ranks, strengthen the organizational work of research forces, and strengthen and expand cooperation with each other. Last but also most importantly is to strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen political and ideological work, and strengthen the self-transformation of researchers.
    After a year of hard struggle in 1958, great achievements have been made, and rich experience has also been gained. Although there are still many difficulties and not small shortcomings in the work, we believe that as long as we can closely rely on the leadership of the Party, exert full effort and strive for the upstream, philosophy and social sciences will not only have a greater leap forward in 1959, but also a better leap forward.

    乘胜奋进
    潘梓年
    1958年是苦战三年的第一年，也是哲学社会科学工作苦战的第一年。在这一年中，哲学社会科学工作者经过了这样几个战役：首先是整风反右。接着是下乡上山，劳动锻炼；走马看花和下马观花，向劳动人民学习。接着是整风补课，批判资产阶级的学术观点和治学方法。接着是集体写作；下乡下厂种试验田。这些战役的战果都是不小的。反右，清除了不少混杂在科学队伍中的资产阶级右派分子，在政治战线上和思想战线上取得了决定性的胜利。整风，特别是整风补课，划清了科学工作中的两条道路和两种方法的界限，在思想战线上取得了进一步胜利，从而明确了科学工作的方针和路线——哲学社会科学的研究工作必须为工人阶级的政治服务，必须走群众路线。集体写作，成绩十分巨大，广大的青年师生经过艰苦努力，在比较短的时间内就写出了几十万字以至几百万字的各种各样的著作。种试验田，也已摸索出了一点经验，为贯彻新的方针路线作了良好的开端。
    1959年，哲学社会科学部门，也和其他各部门一样，将是继续大跃进的一年。哲学社会科学部门的各学科的研究工作者都已在纷纷拟订他们的苦战计划。这些计划，由于各学科的情况不同，彼此不很相同，甚至很不相同；但是大体说来，不出乎下列几条。一是大力学习党的八届六中全会的主要文件，研究社会主义、共产主义、现实生活中的主要理论问题，从理论上来阐发党的各项政策方针，以期对社会主义、共产主义的宣传教育有所帮助。一是进一步批判资产阶级的学术思想，把马克思列宁主义的红旗，毛泽东思想的红旗，高高地插上各学科的每一个工作岗位。一是努力写著，整理资料，向中华人民共和国开国十周年纪念献礼。一是整顿科学队伍，加强对研究力量的组织工作，加强和扩大彼此的协作。最后也是最重要的是加强党的领导，加强政治思想工作，加强研究工作者的自我改造。
    经过1958年一年的苦战，已经取得了巨大的成绩，也取得了丰富的经验。尽管在工作中还存在着不少的困难和不小的缺点，但是我们相信，只要能够紧紧地依靠着党的领导，鼓足干劲、力争上游，哲学社会科学在1959年不仅会有更大的跃进，而且会跃进得更好。
