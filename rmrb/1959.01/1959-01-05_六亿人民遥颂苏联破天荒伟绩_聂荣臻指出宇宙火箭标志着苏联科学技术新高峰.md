Many people wrote enthusiastic poems to praise this great historical event.

The good news that the Soviet cosmic rocket passed through the lunar region and will become the first man-made solar planet brought the people of the capital to a new climax of jubilation. Many people stayed by the radio and loudspeakers from 12:00 Beijing time, waiting for the good news that the rocket had successfully crossed the lunar region. Fearing that the workers would not be able to hear the important news that the rocket had successfully crossed the moon due to the noise of the machines, the broadcasters and engineers of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory rebroadcast the news recordings of the radio station many times. Beijing's newspapers published a joint "extra edition" to report the world-shaking news to the people of the capital in detail. Students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts braved the piercing cold wind to post posters such as "Red Cosmic Rocket Arrives at the Lunar Palace" in the streets and alleys. Many people went to the Post and Telecommunications Building on West Chang'an Street to send congratulatory telegrams to the Soviet people.

The military and civilians on the Fujian front joyfully sang and danced to warmly celebrate the successful launch of the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket. At 8:30 p.m. on the 3rd, the military and civilians of the entire Nanjiri Island listened to the radio broadcast. Soldiers and militiamen embraced each other, waved their hats, and waved to Moscow to express their congratulations.

He said: The Soviet cosmic rocket has passed the point on its orbit closest to the moon this morning. All the scientific tasks pre-determined before the launch of the rocket have been completed. The success of this cosmic rocket launch marks a new peak in Soviet science and technology, creating a great new era of interstellar flight. Mankind's desire to fly into interstellar space for thousands of years is no longer a fantasy. It seems that mankind's stepping on the surface of other planets is not a distant future. This is an indelible contribution made by Soviet scientists and engineering and technical experts to the happiness and peace cause of mankind.

Nie Rongzhen said: The successful launch of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket convincingly shows that the socialist system promotes the leap-forward development of economy, science, technology and culture, shows the wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and shows that the east wind is continuing to prevail over the west wind with greater advantages. This event will more forcefully strike at the imperialist policy of strength and greatly strengthen the strength and confidence of progressive mankind in the world to maintain lasting peace.

Nie Rongzhen said: This is a very auspicious and happy event at the beginning of this year 1959 for the socialist camp, and it is also a happy event for peace-loving people all over the world.
