Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: From the 3rd to the 4th, from Fujian and Hangzhou in Zhejiang in the east, to the Tibetan Plateau, the Sichuan Basin and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the west, from Harbin in the north to Guangzhou, Nanning, Kunming in the south, as well as the Inner Mongolian grasslands and along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the broad masses of people and people from all walks of life were rejoicing over the Soviet Union's giant cosmic rocket flying into space. Many people wrote enthusiastic poems to praise this great historical event.

The good news that the Soviet cosmic rocket passed through the lunar region and will become the first man-made solar planet brought the people of the capital to a new climax of jubilation. Many people stayed by the radio and loudspeakers from 12:00 Beijing time, waiting for the good news that the rocket had successfully crossed the lunar region. Fearing that the workers would not be able to hear the important news that the rocket had successfully crossed the moon due to the noise of the machines, the broadcasters and engineers of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory rebroadcast the news recordings of the radio station many times. Beijing's newspapers published a joint "extra edition" to report the world-shaking news to the people of the capital in detail. Students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts braved the piercing cold wind to post posters such as "Red Cosmic Rocket Arrives at the Lunar Palace" in the streets and alleys. Many people went to the Post and Telecommunications Building on West Chang'an Street to send congratulatory telegrams to the Soviet people.

The military and civilians on the Fujian front joyfully sang and danced to warmly celebrate the successful launch of the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket. At 8:30 p.m. on the 3rd, the military and civilians of the entire Nanjiri Island listened to the radio broadcast. Soldiers and militiamen embraced each other, waved their hats, and waved to Moscow to express their congratulations. Some listeners in front of the broadcasting speakers cheered repeatedly until late at night without dispersing. On the morning of the 4th, big-character posters and poetry galleries appeared in many places on the island. The militiamen of Nanjiri Island, who have good military skills and won the Red Banner for militia training, shouted "We have won again, the reactionaries have failed again" after hearing the news.

As soon as the good news spread, many factories, organizations and schools in Chengdu immediately posted huge announcements. Actors from the Sichuan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe, the Sichuan Provincial Quyi Troupe, the Chengdu Sichuan Opera Theatre, and the Chengdu Peking Opera Theatre all organized propaganda teams to promote the news on the streets. At the celebration meetings held in various factories, people's communes, organizations, and schools, countless poems of praise were also created.

After the news of the Soviet giant rocket flying to the lunar region came, all the factories, organizations, schools, and neighborhoods in Shanghai were boiling. Day and night, people watched the rocket's trajectory with extremely excited hearts. When the news that the rocket had flown over the lunar region came, people rushed to tell each other, and the sound of firecrackers and gongs and drums rang out. "Learn from the Soviet elder brother, accelerate the Great Leap Forward" was the determination made by Shanghai workers under the inspiration of the good news of the Soviet rocket passing over the moon. Qian Sanqiang, director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote an article in Shanghai discussing the significance of the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket. He pointed out that this was a great event in human history, and the achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and technology left the United States far behind.

After the good news reached Taiyuan City, people from all walks of life in the city cheered. On the streets, in the alleys, on buses, and in offices, everyone was vying to read the extra edition of the Shanxi Daily, which published the good news, and they were running around telling each other and talking excitedly. The broadcasting station of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory broadcasted the good news, and many workers couldn't help but cheer with their arms raised. After hearing this encouraging news, people in the scientific and technological circles immediately held a heated discussion. During the discussion, they pointed out that the Soviet Union's brilliant achievement was a head-on blow to the US imperialism's arrogant attempt to "use outer space as a strategic base."

People of all ethnic groups in Yinchuan City were greatly elated by the good news on the 3rd. People ran around spreading the good news. The young teachers and students of universities and middle schools in the city who were holding a poetry contest in the auditorium of Yinchuan Health School immediately wrote poems and went on stage to recite them after hearing the news.

Workers, farmers, troops stationed in the area, cadres of organizations, faculty, staff and students in Jinan and Qingdao all cheered for another great achievement in Soviet science. On the 3rd, broadcasting loudspeakers in all theaters and cinemas in Jinan immediately launched extensive publicity. The audience responded to this encouraging news with prolonged applause. After the news spread to the factory, the workers spread it from one to ten and from ten to hundreds, and the cheers of the workers were connected together. When the good news reached the Institute of Oceanography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, scientists rushed to read the extra edition of the newspaper. The officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Qingdao unanimously believed that this was a great happy event for the socialist camp in 1959.

After receiving the news of the Soviet cosmic rocket launch on the 3rd, the Anhui Daily published an extra edition at about 2 p.m. and distributed it over Hefei City by plane. Streets, courtyards, parks, residential sides, rooftops... red extra editions could be picked up everywhere, and dozens of people vied to read one. Suddenly, the people of the whole city boiled. More than 500 employees of the iron and steel plant of the provincial industrial and transportation system, who were holding a swearing-in meeting to welcome the 1959 steel production task, were all overjoyed after learning the news.

On the evening of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th, people from the scientific community in Henan held a forum. Workers, soldiers and officers stationed in the area, teachers and students from many schools, and cadres of organizations such as Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory, Steel Plant, Machinery Plant, and Oil and Fat Chemical Plant held forums to talk about the great historical significance of the Soviet Union's launch of this giant rocket. After hearing the news, Ji Wenfu, president of Zhengzhou University and a historian, immediately wrote a poem: "The first good news this year, a red rocket goes to the lunar palace, the American devils sigh in vain, the east wind prevails over the west wind again."

When the news of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket launch reached Hohhot, whether workers, PLA soldiers, citizens or cadres, they all ran to tell each other. In an instant, the people of the whole city were cheered by the unprecedented creation of Soviet science and technology. The Science Work Committee and the Science and Technology Association of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region jointly held a forum on the same day.

At noon on the 4th, people from all walks of life held a forum in the conference room of the office building of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. While the forum was in progress, news was received from Beijing that the Soviet rocket had reached the lunar region, and people applauded and cheered to their heart's content, congratulating this great victory of mankind's conquest of the universe.

Those who spoke at the forum included ApÃª Awang Jinmei, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Chijiang Living Buddha, deputy sutra teacher of the Dalai Lama, Sokang Wangqing Geler, Chief Kalon of the Tibetan local government, and the heads of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, the Tibetan Local Cadre School, and the Lhasa Youth and Women's Organizations. They all regarded this huge scientific achievement of the Soviet Union as a common victory for the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world. The speakers also said that the cosmic rocket's launch made them further realize the unparalleled strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the east wind continues to prevail over the west wind with greater advantages, and at the same time strengthened their confidence and determination to build a socialist motherland and build a new Tibet.

In the past two days, the broad masses of people in Shenyang, Wuhan, Xining, Guiyang, Xi'an, Changchun, Changsha and other places have also been rejoicing and celebrating the successful launch of the Soviet giant cosmic rocket, celebrating this great victory of the socialist camp at the beginning of 1959. People in the scientific community in various places have also held forums, saying that they will better learn from Soviet scientists to further serve the great leap forward of socialist production in the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. The good news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a cosmic rocket flying towards the moon direction has encouraged the representatives who are participating in the National Local Science and Technology Work Conference in Shanghai. Today, this reporter interviewed Nie Rongzhen, director of the Science and Technology Commission, who is presiding over the National Local Science and Technology Work Conference in Shanghai, and he made a statement to the reporter on this major event.

Nie Rongzhen first expressed warm praise and congratulations to the Soviet government, the Soviet people and the Soviet science and technology workers for successfully launching the cosmic rocket for the first time. He said: The Soviet cosmic rocket has passed the point on its orbit closest to the moon this morning. All the scientific tasks pre-determined before the launch of the rocket have been completed. The success of this cosmic rocket launch marks a new peak in Soviet science and technology, creating a great new era of interstellar flight. Mankind's desire to fly into interstellar space for thousands of years is no longer a fantasy. It seems that mankind's stepping on the surface of other planets is not a distant future. This is an indelible contribution made by Soviet scientists and engineering and technical experts to the happiness and peace cause of mankind.

Nie Rongzhen said: The successful launch of the Soviet Union's cosmic rocket convincingly shows that the socialist system promotes the leap-forward development of economy, science, technology and culture, shows the wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and shows that the east wind is continuing to prevail over the west wind with greater advantages. This event will more forcefully strike at the imperialist policy of strength and greatly strengthen the strength and confidence of progressive mankind in the world to maintain lasting peace.

Nie Rongzhen said: This is a very auspicious and happy event at the beginning of this year 1959 for the socialist camp, and it is also a happy event for peace-loving people all over the world. Progressive mankind all over the world will cheer for the Soviet Union's another great contribution to mankind in science and technology.

Nie Rongzhen finally emphasized: The Soviet Union's great achievement in science and technology is a powerful encouragement to the Chinese people and science and technology workers who are accelerating the socialist construction of our country. All science and technology workers in our country must work harder to learn advanced Soviet science, closely cooperate with Soviet science and technology workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, go all out, aim high, and strive to make our country's scientific cause also develop rapidly and contribute to progressive mankind.
