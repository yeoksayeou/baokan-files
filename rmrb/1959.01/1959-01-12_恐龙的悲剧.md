    The Tragedy of the Dinosaurs
    Liu Feng
    In Guo Moruo's "Dialogue Between the Space Rocket and the Artificial Satellite," published in this newspaper on January 5, the issue of dinosaur fossils was mentioned. We have received letters from readers Ling Shijia in Tianjin and Jia Bukui in Kaifeng, inquiring about dinosaur fossils. We now provide a brief response here. – Editor

    According to Yunnan Daily, dinosaur fossils have recently been discovered in Lufeng County, Yunnan. Based on the study of these fossils, it is possible to deduce the era, climate, and geographical conditions in which the rock layer containing them was formed, and further analyze what minerals might be generated under these conditions. Therefore, the discovery of dinosaur fossils is beneficial for helping us find minerals and understand the evolution of organisms.

    About 150 million years ago, many giant reptiles appeared on Earth. For a time, animals that crawled on the ground, swam in the water, and even flew in the sky were all of this type. Some were over ten feet tall, and some were even tens of feet long, weighing tens of tons, with extremely fierce appearances. Such animals are called dragons or dinosaurs. They are further divided: those that fly in the sky are dragons and pterodactyls; those that swim in the water are ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs; those that crawl on the ground are dinosaurs, and so on. They are not the dragons in myths and legends.

    When dinosaurs still lived on Earth, the climate was warm, the terrain was flat, and life was flourishing, which was very suitable for their survival, because they were afraid of the cold, and their clumsy bodies only allowed them to crawl slowly on the flat ground, or simply lie in the swamps, "eating their fill all day long and doing nothing." Some dinosaurs even lived by preying on each other.

    History moved forward, but the dinosaurs still lived the same old way. Thus, their end came: the climate gradually became colder, making their smooth, bare skin unable to withstand the invasion of the cold; the terrain also became uneven due to crustal movement, and their range of activity gradually shrank, while food gradually failed to supply their huge appetites, because the climate was bad and life was not as flourishing as in the past. One by one, they starved to death. After a few more years, these monsters that once rampaged for a time turned into fossils.

    Dinosaurs are now extinct, but their remains still have some of the uses mentioned above. And those 20th-century dinosaurs – the warmongers of the capitalist world, such as Dulles and his ilk, are just as Guo Lao wrote in the "Dialogue Between the Space Rocket and the Artificial Satellite" in the People's Daily on January 5: "If they do not change as soon as possible, they will only become fossils."

    恐龙的悲剧
    柳风
    1月5日本报发表的郭沫若同志的“宇宙火箭与人造卫星对话”一文中，提到了恐龙化石的事。我们收到天津凌士嘉、开封贾步奎两读者的来信，询问恐龙化石是怎么回事。现在在这里作一个简单的答复。　——编　者
    据云南日报报道，最近在云南禄丰县又发现了恐龙化石。根据对这种化石的研究，可以推测出它所在岩石层形成的时代、气候和地理情况，并进而分析在这种条件下会生成什么矿产。所以恐龙化石的发现，对帮助我们找矿和了解生物的衍化都有利。
    大约在一亿五千多万年以前，地球上出现了许多巨大的爬行动物。一时在地上爬的、水里游的、甚至天上飞的，都是这类动物。它们有的高达丈余，有的甚至长达数丈，体重数十吨，外貌极其凶恶。这样的动物，人们把它称为龙或恐龙。把它细分，天空飞的是飞龙和翼手龙；水里游的是鱼龙蛇颈龙，地上爬的是恐龙等等。它们都不是神话传说中的那种龙。
    恐龙还在地球上生存时，那时候气候温暖，地势平坦，生物繁盛，很适于它生存，因为它怕冷、笨重的身躯使它只能在平坦的地上慢慢爬行，或者干脆躺在沼泽里“饱食终日、无所用心”。还有些恐龙则以自相残杀为生。
    历史向前发展了，恐龙可还是老样子生活着。于是，它的末日降临了：气候逐渐寒冷起来，使它那光滑裸露的皮肤抵挡不住寒气的侵袭；地势也因为地壳运动变得起伏不平，它的活动范围慢慢缩小了，而食物也逐渐供应不上它那巨大的胃口，因为气候不好，生物没有过去那样繁盛。最后一个个地饿死了。再经过若干年，这种曾经横行一时的怪物就变成了化石。
    恐龙现在是绝迹了，不过它的遗体多少还有上面说的那些用处。而那些二十世纪的恐龙——资本主义世界的好战分子如杜勒斯之流，正如1月5日人民日报上郭老所写的“宇宙火箭与人造卫星对话”中所说：“如果不及早转变，便只好成为化石。”（附图片）
