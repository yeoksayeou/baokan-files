    The spring couplets passed down through custom are now shouldering another historical task, as tools to inspire fighting spirit and express our soaring enthusiasm. Every household hangs red, every household changes new ones, which is different from the superficial joy of the old days, and the "window dressing" that was actually bitter inside.
    When discussing the origin of spring couplets, people start with Meng Chang, the ruler of Shu in the Song Dynasty, who inscribed "peach charms" with "The New Year welcomes abundant blessings, the auspicious festival is called Everlasting Spring."
    (Peach charms were wooden boards with images of door gods drawn on them, which ancient people placed at the entrance on New Year's Day to drive away evil spirits.) However, this kind of custom did not necessarily start with Meng Chang. It is possible that in the era of theocracy, there were already pressure-exorcising words like the later popular "Jiang Taigong is here, nothing is forbidden" or "Orders are here, all evils avoid." Later, in order to get a "good omen," they were written as auspicious and joyous words. The wording gradually became elaborate, turning into the current style of spring couplets.
    Spring couplets, like other literary works, represent the different wishes and thoughts of different classes in different eras. In the old couplets, in addition to the common "San Yang Kaitai, Wanxiang Huichun" (Three Yangs Bring Prosperity, All Things Rejuvenate), which praised the transformation of nature and human affairs, there were also happy aspirations like "Heaven increases years, people increase longevity, spring fills the universe, and blessings fill the door." Others wrote sentences expressing different wishes based on their respective classes and occupations. Bureaucrats and landlords had the same interests as the ruling heads, so they posted words of praise like "The Emperor's virtue is as great as the universe, and the Emperor's grace is as deep as rain and dew." In the past, small farmers cultivated the land and inevitably "relied on the heavens for food," fearing untimely floods and droughts the most. At the same time, the struggle of the oppressed against the rulers was what the vested interests feared most. Therefore, whether it was the upper classes or temples and public offices, they all wrote "Good weather for crops, national peace and people's tranquility" and other sentences praying for peace. Furthermore, in order to weaken the people's rebellious sentiments and prevent them from shaking their rule, they advocated the philosophy of "contentment with fate" and used the pair of anesthetizing couplets "Knowing sufficiency brings constant happiness, enduring brings self-peace" as door couplets. Some, in order to boast of their family and yearn for wealth, those surnamed Wu would write "Yanling's family tradition, the family's reputation of supreme virtue"; those surnamed Zhu would write "Xinan's family tradition, the family's reputation of the White Deer." (The first two characters of the upper couplet are the name of the county where their ancestors originally lived, and the first two characters of the lower couplet are based on the ancestors' virtues and careers. "Supreme Virtue" refers to Wu Taibo abdicating the throne to his younger brother, and later generations said he had the virtue of concession. "White Deer" refers to Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty, who lectured at the White Deer Cave Academy.) Merchants posted "Business prospers in all directions, wealth flourishes in all rivers," vividly portraying their profit-only faces. Some of these couplets had to embed the store name in them. For example, for "Hengmao Store," they would write "The sun rises monthly, bamboo prospers, pine flourishes" to bring good luck. As for the majority of workers and peasants, who could not handle writing brushes, they could only express general wishes and simply posted straightforward sentences like "Open the door to great luck" and "Accumulate good deeds and have more than enough." Even more simply, they only posted two strips of red paper, with no words or sentences.
    Since liberation, in the ever-changing leap forward of the motherland, with successive victories, constantly tearing down the old and replacing it with the new, people are working vigorously, and the couplets are becoming more and more fiery red. In this splendid spring, every household is vying to post spring couplets that express their happy mood and soaring energy. The content of the couplets is even more rich and varied.

    春联史话

    习俗传下的春联，目下正担起另一历史任务，作为奋发斗志，表达我们的冲天干劲的工具了。家家挂红，户户换新，也不同旧时代的表面欢欣，而内实酸辛的“门面话”了。
    春联起源，谈的人都以宋代蜀主孟昶题“桃符”的“新年纳余庆，佳节号长春”为开端。
    （桃符是古人于元旦日在门口设画有门神的木板，以驱邪鬼），不过这类习俗，不一定从孟昶开始，可能神权时代，早有像后世流行的“姜太公在此，百无禁忌。”或“有令在此，诸恶远避”一类压邪话张挂门上。以后为了讨个“口采”，写成吉语喜话。文句逐渐工致，变成现式的春联了。
    春联和其它文艺作品一样，代表不同时代各阶层不同的愿望和思想。旧联中除通用的“三阳开泰，万象回春”歌颂自然和人事的转换外，又有“天增岁月人增寿，春满乾坤福满门”一类幸福憧憬话。其它便各就所属阶级、职业，写出不同愿望的文句。官僚地主们对统治头子的利益是一致的，就张着“帝德乾坤大，皇恩雨露深”一类歌功颂德的话儿。过去小农耕作，不免“靠天吃饭”最怕水旱不时。同时被压迫者反对统治者的斗争，是既得权益者最害怕的，因此不论上层分子和寺庙公廨，都标写着“风调雨顺，国泰民安”等祈求太平句子。更为了削弱人民的反抗情绪，免得摇撼他们的统治，就提倡“乐天知命”的人生观，用“知足常乐，能忍自安”一副麻醉联儿做门联，有的为了夸耀门第，企慕富贵，姓吴的就写“延陵世泽，至德家声”；姓朱的便写“新安世泽，白鹿家声”。（上联头两字是他们祖先原住郡名，下联头两字根据祖先德行事业来题。“至德”指吴太伯让王位于弟，后人说他有让德。“白鹿”指宋代朱熹，曾在白鹿洞书院讲学。）商人则贴出“生意兴隆通四海，财源茂盛达三江”，活画出唯利是图的嘴脸。这类联句有些要把行号名称嵌进去。如“恒茂号”，则题“日升月‘恒’，竹苞松‘茂’”，以取吉利。至于大多数工农群众，不会调笔弄墨，只能道出概括的愿望，只贴着“开门大吉”“积善有余”一些直率句子。更干脆的，只贴两条红纸，无字无句。
    解放以后，在祖国日新月异的跃进中，胜利迭传的情况下，不断扯旧换新，人是干得轰轰烈烈，联更红得火辣辣地。在这绚烂的春天里，家家户户都争先贴上些抒发心情舒畅、干劲冲天的春联。对联的内容更是丰富多采，不一而足。
