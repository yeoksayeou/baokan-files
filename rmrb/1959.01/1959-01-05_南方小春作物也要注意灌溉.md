    Southern provinces are the main production areas for minor spring crops in our country. Last year, the winter wheat sowing area in eleven southern provinces accounted for 31.5% of the national winter wheat sowing area. The rape production in the Southwest region also accounts for a large proportion of the country. Other crops such as broad beans are also widely sown in the south. Therefore, increasing the yield of minor spring crops in the southern region is of great significance for guaranteeing the completion of the 1959 grain and oil production plan.
    In the past, farmers in some areas of the South did not pay enough attention to minor spring crops, considering them "lazy crops," and therefore rarely irrigated them. This situation began to change in 1958 with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture nationwide. Many regions are breaking with old habits, strengthening the management of minor spring crops, and carrying out irrigation. Sichuan plans to irrigate 35 million mu of minor spring crops this year. In the Luzhou and Daxian special districts, the area irrigated for minor spring crops last year has reached 80%-90% of the area that should be irrigated. Yunnan Province has put forward irrigation measures to adhere to moistening the soil to resist drought and ensure a bumper harvest of minor spring crops, first focusing on winter irrigation to allow the minor spring crops to drink enough and grow quickly and strongly. Guizhou, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces are also focusing on winter irrigation of minor spring crops.
    However, the issue of irrigation for minor spring crops has not attracted the attention of cadres in all wheat-producing areas.
    Some cadres in the southern region believe that there is a lot of rain in their area, and spring-sown minor spring crops do not need irrigation. Is irrigation necessary or not? The answer is definitely: it is necessary. Judging from rainfall, although the rainfall in the southern region is higher than in the northern region, many areas cannot meet the water needs of minor spring crops during their growing season. According to the rainfall data of Chengdu, Sichuan, for thirty-two years, the average annual rainfall is 1,037 mm, and the rainfall from January to May accounts for only 7.2% of the annual rainfall, and the rainfall from October to December accounts for only 7.1% of the annual rainfall. It can be seen that the growing season of minor spring crops is actually dry, which is very unfavorable to the growth of minor spring crops. Therefore, we say that the irrigation of minor spring crops, like the irrigation of other crops, is a key measure to ensure a bumper harvest. According to key surveys in Santai, Zhongjiang and other counties in Sichuan Province, minor spring crops that are irrigated yield about 30% more than those that are not irrigated. Wheat irrigation in the Tuanjie Cooperative in Yingjing County yields 32.5% more than that without irrigation; rape irrigation yields 30.6% more than that without irrigation.
    Recently, drought has occurred successively in some areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Fujian and other provinces. In areas where drought is more serious in Yunnan Province, wheat seedlings are emerging unevenly, and some of the emerged wheat and bean seedlings are turning yellow. This shows that minor spring crop fields in drought-stricken areas are currently in urgent need of irrigation. As for other areas, winter and spring irrigation of minor spring crops should also be vigorously promoted according to natural characteristics in winter and spring, and irrigation should be combined with topdressing to resolutely prevent third-class seedlings from overwintering.
    Of course, due to different rainfall amounts, the amount of irrigation water required for minor spring crops in the southern region is less than that in the northern region; when irrigation is needed in each region also depends on local climate conditions. In addition, the irrigation methods in the South should also be different from those in the North. In some areas, there is more rain in winter and spring, and minor spring crops may not need irrigation, and ditch clearing and drainage work are also required; during irrigation, the southern region should combine rainfall conditions, pay attention to combining irrigation and drainage, and save water. The experience of Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, is to check the fields first, then release water; release water to distant fields first, then to nearby fields; release water to fields that need water urgently first, then to general fields; use continuous flow first, then use dam and pond water. This method can effectively save water. In terms of irrigation methods, the backward irrigation method of flooding irrigation must be eliminated. Some areas in Sichuan and Hubei have adopted the method of "irrigating by soaking in furrows in compartments," which is to make the terraced fields into ridges and open ditches around the fields. This ditch has both irrigation and drainage functions. This method improves the quality of irrigation and achieves both irrigation and drainage benefits. Irrigation is combined with field management, so that conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil are closely coordinated, so that water can play the greatest role in crop growth. This is a good irrigation method that is worth promoting.

### 南方小春作物也要注意灌溉

    南方小春作物也要注意灌溉
  南方各省是我国小春作物的主要产地。去年南方十一个省的冬小麦播种面积，占了全国冬麦播种面积的31.5％。西南地区的油菜产量，也占全国很大比重。其他如蚕豆等作物，在南方播种的也不少。因此，提高南方地区的小春作物产量，对保证完成1959年粮食和油料生产计划有着重要意义。
    过去，南方一些地区的农民对于小春作物不够重视，认为小春作物是“懒庄稼”，因此很少对小春作物进行灌溉。这种情况在1958年全国工农业大跃进中开始有所改变，许多地区正打破了旧习惯，加强了小春管理，进行了灌溉。四川今年计划灌溉小春作物三千五百万亩，泸州、达县两专区去年浇灌小春面积已达应灌面积的80％—90％。云南省提出了坚持润水抗旱、确保小春翻身的灌溉措施，首先抓紧冬灌，让小春喝足饮够，快长快大。贵州、安徽、江苏等省也在抓紧小春作物的冬灌。
    但是对于小春作物灌溉的问题并没有引起所有产麦区干部的注意。
    南方地区有些干部认为他们那里雨多，小春作物春播可以不灌溉。到底需要不需要灌溉呢？肯定地说：需要。从降雨情况来看，南方地区虽然比北方地区降雨量多，但不少地区不能满足小春作物生长期内所需要的水分。根据四川成都三十二年降雨资料统计，平均年降雨量是一千零三十七公厘，1月至5月间降雨仅占全年雨量的7.2％，10月至12月降雨仅占全年雨量的7.1％。可见小春作物的生长期实际上是干旱的，这是对小春作物的生长很不利的。因此我们说，小春作物的灌溉与其他作物的灌溉一样，是保证丰产的关键措施。根据四川省三台、中江等县的重点调查，小春作物灌溉的比不灌溉的增产30％左右；荥经县团结社的小麦灌溉的比不灌溉的增产32.5％；油菜灌溉的比不灌溉的增产30.6％。
    最近，广东、广西、贵州、湖南、福建等省的一部分地区，都先后发生干旱现象。云南省干旱比较严重的地方，麦苗出得不齐，已出的麦苗、豆苗有的发黄。这说明干旱地区的小春作物田目前更是迫切需要灌水。至于其他地区，在冬春也应当根据自然特点，大力推广小春作物的冬春灌溉，并使灌溉与追肥相结合，坚决不让三类苗过冬。
    当然，由于降雨量不同，南方地区的小春作物需要的灌水量比北方要少些；各个地区什么时候需要灌溉，也要看当地气候情况而定。此外，在灌溉方法上，南方也应当不同于北方。部分地区冬春雨水较多，小春作物可以不灌溉，并且还需要进行清沟排渍工作；在进行灌溉时，南方地区要结合降雨情况，注意灌排结合，节约用水。云南省玉溪县的经验是先查田，后放水；先放远田，后放近田；先放需水急的田，后放一般田；先用长流水，后用坝塘水。采用这种作法可以有效地节约用水。在灌水方法上，要消灭大水漫灌的落后灌溉方法。四川、湖北有些地区采用了“分厢开沟浸灌”的方法，就是使台田成畦，围田开沟，这种沟兼有灌、排两种作用。这种方法提高了灌溉质量，也做到灌排两利。灌水结合田间管理，使水、肥、土等条件密切配合起来，使水对作物生长发挥最大作用。这是值得提倡的一种良好的灌溉方法。
