Editorial Notes:

    Quickly Making Labor Plans
    Making labor plans early and comprehensively is an important issue right now.
    To guarantee the comprehensive development of agriculture, industry, and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries this year, we must make comprehensive arrangements for the allocation of labor, adhering to the principle of guaranteeing the key points while taking care of the general situation. Otherwise, it is possible to focus on one thing and lose sight of another.
    To ensure a greater leap forward this year, and to combine work and rest rhythmically, we cannot pin our hopes on simply increasing working hours. Instead, we must make the most reasonable and effective use of labor in all areas, earnestly strengthen labor management, and vigorously promote tool reform to increase labor efficiency by multiples, even several times, to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor.
    All of this requires planning, proposing measures so that leaders and the masses are clear about the situation and can start working in a planned way.
    Now is the time. We hope that those places that have not yet made labor plans will refer to the practices of Jincheng, Shanxi, and quickly start making labor plans.

    快把劳动规划作好
    及早地全面地进行劳动规划，是当前一个重要问题。
    要保证今年农业、工业以及林、牧、副、渔各业全面发展，就必须在保证重点、照顾一般的原则下，对劳动力的分配作出全面的安排。否则，就有可能顾此而失彼。
    要保证今年有更大的跃进，又要做到劳与逸有节奏地结合起来，就不能把希望寄托于单纯增加劳动时间，而必须使各方面的劳力得到最合理最有效的使用，认真地加强劳动管理，并大搞工具改革，以便成倍、成几倍的提高劳动效率，克服劳动力不足的困难。
    这一切，都需要作出规划，提出措施，使领导和群众都心中有数，有计划地动手去做。
    现在已经是时候了，希望那些没有作出劳动规划的地方，参考一下山西晋城的做法，赶快动手把劳动规划作出来。
