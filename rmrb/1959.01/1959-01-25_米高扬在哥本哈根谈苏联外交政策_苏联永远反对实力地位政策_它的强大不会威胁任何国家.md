Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, January 24th: TASS reports from Copenhagen: On the evening of the 22nd, the Danish-Soviet Association held a gathering at the "Odd Fellow Palace," a large music hall in Copenhagen. First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, delivered a speech on Soviet foreign policy.

Mikoyan said that during World War II, the Soviet Union established friendship on the battlefield with the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, and other anti-Hitler Allied countries that fought against fascism. We originally hoped that this friendship, established during the war, could be maintained after the war. However, in the years following the war, the situation became tense and relations deteriorated. This was because the United States began to adopt a "position of strength" policy toward the Soviet Union. At that time, the United States already had the atomic bomb. We did not yet have it. However, regardless of the balance of power in the world, our government, our country, will always oppose the "position of strength" policy and oppose issuing orders. Three years later, we also had the atomic bomb, and later we tested the world's first hydrogen bomb. It was a year later that the Americans made the hydrogen bomb. Even at this time, we still stood on the side of those who opposed the "position of strength" policy.

In October 1957, our rocket sent the first artificial satellite into space, followed by the second, and then the third. The third satellite is still orbiting the Earth today, and its accuracy is comparable to that of the Moon. At the beginning of this year, our new rocket reached the lunar region and entered an orbit around the sun, becoming a new planet orbiting the sun. However, we still oppose the "position of strength" policy, oppose war, and strive for international peace and friendship. This is Lenin's legacy, this is the Leninist policy of the Soviet Union.

Mikoyan said that after the war, some people spread rumors and slanders about the Soviet Union, insisting that we wanted to attack others and threaten others. Some countries, including Denmark, were unduly alarmed by this propaganda and were so frightened that they did not maintain neutrality like Sweden, but joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We regret this. For many years, the Soviet and Danish people have maintained friendly relations, and we are willing to live in peace with the Danish people, just like all other peoples. You are in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and we regret this and hope that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact will all collapse (applause). But since this is not possible at present, let us all work together to strive for the conclusion of a convention that makes the countries of these two blocs not invade each other.

Mikoyan said that we have also taken other measures to strengthen peace in Europe. We have put forward many proposals to defend peace. We do this not out of fear, not because we are not good at fighting or are weak, no. We are now stronger than ever, and can prove that we are good at fighting, and we have enough courage. We believe that war is a disaster for mankind, and that fighting with modern weapons is a catastrophe. Our socialist country is also a wealthy country in terms of economy and culture, and we hope it will become wealthier and have a higher culture. In a few days, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will open, and N.S. Khrushchev will deliver a report on the seven-year plan for the cultural and economic development of our country. And this is not the last plan for our economic and cultural development.

Mikoyan said that all the nonsense about the military threat from the Soviet Union is unfounded and untenable. The United States does not talk much about the Soviet military threat now. What is talked about more now is something else, saying that after the Soviet Union becomes economically stronger, it will become an economic threat to the United States and other countries. This, like the anti-Soviet propaganda in the past, is also unfounded. If our people can eat better, dress better, and have more goods and housing, who will be harmed by this? This is also good for the workers in other countries. When the bourgeoisie in these countries see that life in the Soviet Union is improving, they will have to make concessions to their own workers, and the lives of the workers will also improve.

Mikoyan said that we hope to eliminate the traces left by the last war in Europe. Thirteen years have passed since the end of the war, but there is still no peace treaty with Germany. How long will the situation of not having a peace treaty with Germany last? How long will the occupation of West Berlin last? The Western countries are not in a hurry, but this situation contains serious dangers.

Some people object to us, saying that we should wait until Germany is unified. But how can Germany be unified when there are now two Germanys with different social systems on German territory? It should be known that the German Democratic Republic will not abandon its socialist system, and the Federal Republic of Germany will not abandon its capitalist system. This situation has existed for about ten years. The government of the German Democratic Republic took the first step towards unification, suggesting the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys. This is not complete unification, but the United States and the Soviet Union have both adopted this form in history. Some people say that free elections should be held, as if this could lead to German unification. But can voting alone eliminate the contradictions that currently exist there? The West German government is unwilling to negotiate with the government of the German Democratic Republic. They want unification, but they are unwilling to talk! (applause) Even belligerent countries negotiate through military envoys. The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic are not at war, but they do not talk because the Federal Republic of Germany is unwilling to talk. The Federal Republic of Germany wants to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty, hoping to become stronger and use force to solve the problem of "unification." But why does the Federal Republic of Germany think that they will become stronger, while the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp will become weaker?

The question now is which path will the international situation develop along, towards war, or towards easing tensions and negotiations. The first to oppose the peace treaty is Adenauer. He has forgotten that he represents a defeated country. He is really forgetful! (laughter, applause)

Mikoyan said that Strauss, a minister in Bonn, is now trying to obtain rocket weapons for the West German armed forces. He is unwilling to consider what a rocket war would mean for Germany. Last year I met him in Bonn, and I said to him: Mr. Strauss, you want to eliminate the Soviet Union from the Earth. Everyone knows that your predecessors also wanted to do this, but they all failed. If you have any new ways to achieve this goal, then please tell us! (applause) If it is with atomic bombs, then the first to suffer will be Germany.

Mikoyan said that if West Germany is militarized at a rapid pace and its armed forces grow, it will pose a great danger to the peoples of countries that have been invaded by Germany more than once in the past. If the West German armed forces obtain atomic rocket weapons, and people like Strauss sit in the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, we will all feel the threat of war from West Germany. People like Strauss want to play with bombs and rockets. Doing so is like putting dangerous toys into the hands of such naughty children (the audience is lively, applause).

I repeat, we hope to maintain peace with the people of all countries, including the German people. We hope to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, but this treaty should benefit the German people, not be against the German people.

Speaking of the Soviet Union's proposal on West Berlin, Mikoyan said that some people in the United States told me that our proposal on West Berlin seemed to be an ultimatum, saying that we wanted to realize this proposal by force. I replied that these people themselves were fabricating threats to scare themselves and shout about it. If we suggested that Western countries withdraw their troops from West Berlin and hand West Berlin over to the German Democratic Republic (which of course is reasonable), that might still show some unease. Now we are only suggesting that there should only be its own internal police in West Berlin and no foreign troops. The system will be as the West Berliners themselves wish. The roads into West Berlin should be open from all directions—whether from the West or from the East—and the countries concerned should guarantee non-interference in the affairs of West Berlin. A permanent United Nations committee can be established to exercise supervision so that no one can interfere in the affairs of West Berlin. What do Western countries lose? We have put forward the best way to solve the Berlin problem on the basis of international guarantees.

Mikoyan then talked about the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests and the Soviet Union's position on this issue.

Mikoyan went on to say: In the United States, I have spoken with many people from all walks of life, political figures, and business people. From these conversations, it can be seen that, apart from State Department personnel continuing the "Cold War," everyone is tired of the "Cold War." I was very well received, and people were not avoiding contact, but seeking contact. The American people hope to ease the situation and bring the Soviet Union and the United States closer. It can be said that in recent months, there have been some achievements in developing cultural ties and establishing direct contact between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Mikoyan ended his speech with the following words: Let us all work together to fight for peace and friendship! These words won a storm of prolonged applause.

Then Mikoyan answered many questions.

    米高扬在哥本哈根谈苏联外交政策
    苏联永远反对实力地位政策  它的强大不会威胁任何国家
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：丹苏协会22日晚上在哥本哈根一家大音乐厅“奥德费卢宫”举行集会，苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在会上就苏联外交政策讲了话。
    米高扬说，在第二次世界大战时期，苏联同美、英、法、丹麦以及其他为反对法西斯主义而斗争的反希特勒同盟国家在战场上建立了友谊。我们原想，这种在战争时期建立起来的友谊在战后能够保持下来。但是，战后数年，形势又变得紧张，关系恶化了。所以如此，是因为美国开始对苏联采取“实力地位”政策。当时美国已经有了原子弹。我们还没有。但是，不管世界上力量对比如何，我们的政府、我们的国家永远反对“实力地位”政策、反对发号施令。三年之后我们也有了原子弹，而后来我们试验了世界上第一枚氢弹，过了一年美国人才制成了氢弹，就在这个时候我们仍然站在“实力地位”政策反对者的立场。
    在1957年10月我们的火箭把第一个人造卫星送入星际空间，接着又发射了第二个，后来发射了第三个，第三个卫星至今仍在围绕地球运行，它运行的准确性可与月球媲美。今年年初我们的新火箭到达了月球区，进入了围绕太阳的轨道并成为一个新行星，围绕着太阳运行，但是，我们仍然反对“实力地位”政策，反对战争，争取国际和平友好。这是列宁的遗训，这是苏联的列宁主义政策。
    米高扬说，战后，有人对苏联大肆造谣和诬蔑，硬说我们想进攻别人，威胁别人。有些国家，其中包括丹麦，在这种宣传中庸人自扰，被吓得不像瑞典那样保持中立了，而是加入了北大西洋公约组织。我们对这一点表示遗憾。多年来苏联和丹麦人民保持着友好关系，我们愿意同丹麦人民和平相处，如同所有其他各国人民一样。你们在北大西洋公约组织中，我们对此表示遗憾，并且希望北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约统统垮台（掌声）。但是目前这还不可能，那末就让我们大家共同努力争取缔结一项使这两个集团的国家互不侵犯的公约。
    米高扬说，我们也曾经采取其他加强欧洲和平的措施。我们提出了许多保卫和平的建议，我们这样做并不是出于害怕，不是因为我们不善于打仗或者软弱，不是的。我们现在比任何时候都强，并且可以证明我们善于打仗，我们有足够的勇气。我们认为战争是对人类的灾难，而用现代的武器作战，那就是一场浩劫。我们这个社会主义国家在经济和文化方面也是一个富有的国家，我们希望它变得更富，有更高的文化。再过几天，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会就要开幕了，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫将在会上作有关我国文化和经济发展七年计划的报告。而这并不是我们经济和文化发展的最后一个计划。
    米高扬说，关于来自苏联的军事威胁的各种胡说是没有根据，是站不住脚的。美国现在已不大谈苏联的军事威胁了。现在谈得更多的是另外一点，说什么苏联在经济上加强后就会成为对美国和其他国家的经济威胁。这同过去的反苏宣传一样，也是没有根据的。如果我们的人能吃得更好、穿得更好，有更多的商品和住宅，这将对谁有坏处呢？这对其他国家的工人也有好处。这些国家的资产阶级看到苏联的生活在改善，就会不得不对自己的工人让步，而工人的生活也就会有改善。
    米高扬说，我们希望消除上次战争在欧洲留下的痕迹。战争结束已经十三年了，但是到现在还没有对德和约。我们没有对德和约的情况还要持续多久呢？西柏林占领地位要保留到几时为止呢？西方国家不着急，可是这种局面蕴藏着严重的危险呀。
    有人反对我们说，在德国没有统一之前，应该等待。可是当现在，在德国的领土上存在着社会制度不同的两个德国的时候，怎么统一德国呢，应该怎么做才能统一德国呢？要知道德意志民主共和国不会放弃自己的社会主义制度，德意志联邦共和国也不会放弃它的资本主义制度。这种局面已经存在约十年了。德意志民主共和国政府采取了走向统一的第一个步骤，建议建立两个德国的邦联。这不是完全的统一，但是在历史上美国和苏联都曾经采用过这种形式。有人说，要进行自由选举，仿佛这样可以走向德国统一。但是难道单单是投票就可以消除那里目前存在的矛盾吗？西德政府不愿意同德意志民主共和国政府谈判。想要统一，可是却不愿意谈！（掌声）甚至交战国都是通过军使进行谈判的。德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国没有处在战争状态，可是它们却不交谈，因为德意志联邦共和国不愿意谈。德意志联邦共和国想拖延缔结和约，希望变得更强大后可以用武力来解决“统一”的问题。但是，为什么德意志联邦共和国会以为，它们会更强大，而德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营会更加软弱呢？
    目前的问题是，国际局势沿哪条道路发展，是朝战争方向发展，还是朝缓和紧张局势和谈判方向发展。首先反对和约的是阿登纳。他忘记了他所代表的是一个战败国。他真健忘！（笑声，掌声）
    米高扬说，波恩的部长施特劳斯现在正在设法给西德武装力量搞火箭武器。他不愿考虑，火箭战争对德国意味着什么。去年我曾经同他在波恩见过面，我对他说：施特劳斯先生，你想把苏联从地球上消灭掉。大家知道，您的那些前任也曾经想这样做过，可是都失败了。如果您有什么新办法来达到这个目的，那就请您谈一谈！（掌声）如果是用原子弹，那末倒霉的首先是德国。
    米高扬说，如果西德将以很快的速度军国主义化，它的武装力量将增长，那就将会对从前曾经不止一次地遭到德国方面侵犯的各国人民产生很大的危险。如果西德武装部队得到原子火箭武器，而施特劳斯之流坐在德意志联邦共和国政府内，我们大家就会感到来自西德方面的战争威胁。施特劳斯之流想玩弄炸弹和火箭。这样做就是把危险的玩具交到这样淘气的孩子的手里（全场活跃，掌声）。
    我再说一遍，我们希望同各国人民，其中也包括德国人民保持和平。我们希望缔结对德和约，但是这个条约应当造福于德国人民，而不是反对德国人民。
    谈到苏联关于西柏林的建议，米高扬说，在美国有些人对我说，似乎我们的关于西柏林的建议是最后通牒式的，说我们想要用武力来实现这种建议。我回答说，是这些人自己在臆造威胁，用来吓唬自己并且就此大喊大叫。如果我们建议西方国家从西柏林撤军并且把西柏林交给德意志民主共和国（这当然是合理的），那也许还可以表现出某种不安。现在我们只不过是建议在西柏林只存在自己内部的警察并且没有外国军队。制度将像西柏林人自己所希望的那样。进入西柏林的道路应当是，从四面八方——不论是从西方，还是从东方——都畅通无阻，有关的国家应当保证不干涉西柏林的事务。可以成立一个联合国常设委员会来实行监督，使任何人也不能干涉西柏林的事务，西方国家有什么损失呢？我们提出了在国际保证的基础上解决柏林问题的最好的办法。
    米高扬接着谈到了停止试验核武器的问题和苏联在这个问题上的立场。
    米高扬接着说：在美国我同很多社会人士、政界人士和实业界人士谈过话，从这些谈话中可以看出，除了国务院人员继续搞“冷战”以外，所有的人都对“冷战”感到厌烦了。我受到了很好的接待，人们并不是躲避接触，而是寻找接触。美国人民希望缓和局势和苏联同美国的接近。可以说，最近几个月以来，在美国同苏联之间发展文化联系和建立直接接触方面有了一些成就。
    米高扬用下面的话来结束他的讲话：让我们大家来同心协力地为和平和友好而斗争！这句话博得了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。
    然后米高扬回答了很多问题。
