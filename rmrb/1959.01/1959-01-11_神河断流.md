The Yellow River plunges from the heavens and flows to the East Sea, its vastness inscribed in our hearts. – Li Bai

The world has many moving myths and legends. When the power of nature still reigned supreme, people often used the power of gods to express their dreams and hopes. Only the legend of Yu the Great taming the flood, this heroic epic praising the heroes of the primordial era, does not use the image of gods but of humans to encapsulate people's beautiful desires and heroic spirit in conquering the Yellow River. As the boatmen of Sanmenxia put it well: "For the timid, there is no path on the Yellow River; where there is the Yellow River, there are people who dare to tame it." For thousands of years, the Chinese people have tempered their character with the turbulent waves of the Yellow River.

People call the Yellow River a "harmful river," a "wicked dragon," a "spendthrift," and compare the Yellow River's floods to the greatest disasters. But none of these express the Chinese people's deep affection for the Yellow River. As a female people's representative from the lower reaches of the Yellow River said:

"We fear it, hate it, resent it, curse it, yet we can't bear to leave it. From the time I can remember, my mother carried me on her back to run from the Yellow River. When I could walk, my father led me by the hand to run from the Yellow River; later, I got married and had children, and I carried my own children on my back to run from the Yellow River. But as soon as the flood recedes, we come back. We are generation after generation inseparable from the Yellow River. I never thought that today we would tame the Yellow River with our own hands."

From the Bayan Har Mountains on the roof of the world to the Bohai Bay on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, the Yellow River flows wildly and violently for thousands of miles across the Asian continent. When floods come, thousands of acres of land are snatched away before our eyes. In an instant, a vast expanse of water, many famous rivers and cities of past dynasties were swallowed up, leveled, and buried deep underground. But once the flood recedes, it is again a fertile plain, and sowing seeds brings a bumper harvest. The Great Plain of China was formed by the Yellow River carrying the Loess Plateau into the sea. What flows in the Yellow River is not muddy waves, but land, crops, and milk soaked with blood and tears!

Yellow River! Yellow River! You are known to the world as the "cradle of civilization" of an ancient civilization, traversing the Chinese continent with the spirit of moving mountains and filling seas, and your violent character hides the heart of a loving mother. As we are about to grasp you in our hands today, what magnificent picture can better arouse people's ambition than the turbulent waves before us!

We will order the Yellow River to give way!
We will lock up the Yellow River!
We will hold the Yellow River in our hands!

Did the Yellow River finally lower its head, or did the raging river finally break through the spur dike? This is a battle against time. For this decisive battle to reverse the history of the Yellow River, an exciting battle cry has been boiling in people's hearts day and night.

The Yellow River seemed to anticipate the moment of the decisive battle, and the river water always refused to recede. Even in mid-November, the flow rate remained above 2,000 cubic meters per second, exceeding the design flow rate for cutoff by a factor of two. This autumn brought the highest water year in fifty years.

Tens of thousands of tons of rocks of all sizes were dumped into the center of the rapids at a rate of one large truck per minute.

Right at the entrance of the gorge, Ghost Gate Island, this is the command center of the decisive battle, and also the starting point of the general offensive, the cutoff command platform overlooks the precarious cliff, and the cutoff highway approaches the mouth of the Shenmen River directly from under the precarious cliff. This is the mainstream Shenmen River of Sanmenxia, the forbidden zone of the rapids center between Ghost Gate Island and Shenmen Island. Fifty-seven dump trucks raced day and night, fully loaded with rocks, traversing the Ghost Gate Overflow Bridge from the right bank, rushing onto Ghost Gate Island, and driving all the way to the end of the highway under the precarious cliff, building a spur dike pointing to the opposite bank.

Sanmenxia is arrayed to lock up the Yellow River...

For three days in a row, the powerful motorcade raced day and night, so bravely, quickly, accurately, and rhythmically. Although coming and going, they had to pass through the narrow Ghost Gate Overflow Bridge and the invasion highway under the precarious cliff. On the first day, 6,000 cubic meters of rock were thrown in, averaging one large truck per minute, exceeding the design requirements by one-half. In the first hour of the 20th, the built-up spur dike had already thrust twelve meters into the river. The Yellow River raged! The Yellow River concentrated its main force and rushed into Shenmen, wishing to collapse the stone walls on both banks and the spur dike in one breath. Time is everything. The speed of the offensive accelerated, fifty seconds per truck, forty seconds per truck, thirty seconds per truck; ten-ton, twelve-ton trucks, three trucks side by side, slammed into the river center; the twenty-five-ton large "Maz" trucks, just arrived from the Soviet Union, also joined the battle. But no matter how big the rocks were, they could not stand firm, and when they barely emerged from the water, they were washed away again; just filled a corner of the whirlpool, and it sank again. For eight hours, the spur dike made no progress. The "international level theory" simply jumped up and down in rage.

"It is simply a mistake and a crime to cut off the flow at such a large flow rate! It is bound to fail!"

But what "international level" has ever had people like us, who has ever seen such cutoff trucks, diving down to the mouth of the dragon and immediately turning around to transport to the tip of the spur dike, and each truck of stone directly unloaded into the river? Who has ever seen such a mechanical group, with neither spare locomotives nor complete sets of spare parts, all投入 into battle for eight consecutive days and nights, never letting the trucks wait empty in the material yard for even a minute? Who has ever seen such bulldozers, flying on the spur dike, leveling the dike head with just one cut, and immediately flashing out a charging road for the trucks with one reverse gear, advancing and retreating all in fifth gear? Who has ever seen such a dragon mouth commando team, with the raging current scouring the dike roots under their feet and the trucks directly hitting the river center behind them, they钻 air pockets in the cracks to repair the road, and the dike head under their hands is always so solid and smooth? And who has ever seen such cutoff commanders, who have never been to university or studied engineering, but have only been滚 on the construction site for a year, they decide on problems that engineering experts dare not decide, and they come up with technical measures that engineering experts can't come up with, and so quickly, just when the spur dike is making no progress, the invasion method comes out?

In the downstream of the mouth of the Shenmen River, right at the center of the three rapids冲喷, a stone pillar stands proudly, this is the famous "Mid-Stream Pillar" since ancient times, the symbol of the Chinese national character. The boatmen of Sanmenxia call it "照我来" (Guide Me). For thousands of years, the boatmen of the Yellow River have found a way in Sanmenxia, this way is riding the waves. Even if the stone wall劈来 head-on seems to smash the wooden boat, they must be tenacious, persistent, and勇往直前. "Guide Me" is a sacred summons. Just at the moment of劈头猛撞, the waves反扑 back from the stone wall, dragging the wooden boat to one side - exactly顺流而下 in the夹胡同 of the cliff峭壁. The dangerous situation of粉身碎骨 also becomes a坦途 for breaking waves and advancing.

The people who猛攻 Shenhe are precisely those who are full of confidence in the face of difficulties. It is precisely the cutoff commanders who are看不上眼 by the engineering experts, who find strength and confidence from千军万马, and see the road to victory from the difficulties at hand. "There is no turning back on the Yellow River," it is impossible to stand firm without猛攻 forward. The upstream dike corner,硬顶着 the rapids, is the focus of全力争夺, and also the "冲锋阵角" for猛攻 Shenhe; the downstream dike corner is the "侧翼阵角" for激流迂回包抄. Huge blocks of stone and concrete四面体 form a continuous突击冲锋部队,两路出击, one way抢占 the key points of前进, and the other way稳住 the侧翼阵角; small pieces of stone are the主力部队 supporting the冲锋 and占领阵地, once两角露出水面, immediately趁势扩展 the "主阵地" of the堤头,掩护两角的冲锋. The "grape bunch" and铅丝石笼 created by the people of the lower reaches of the Yellow River are excellent "战斗小组" and "坚守部队", you冲跑 this piece, and that piece拖住了, you冲跑 that piece, and this piece拖住了 again; one扒住 the 堤坡稳住 the entire阵脚, even if it沉 to the bottom of the water, it must占领住 the阵角 at the bottom of the water. Tenacious and persistent like the people who猛攻 Shenhe.

November 20th was the day when淘刷坍塌 was the most ferocious, and also the day when the spur dike进占 the fastest. At 7:00 a.m. on the 21st, the spur dike had横断 the river mouth twenty-two meters,掐得紧紧的 the neck of the Shenmen River. Once the激流挣出 the 龙口, it only吼的山摇地动, 满河浪花. The "油沫锅" has never had such暴跳如雷 and乱成一团浪花. The old河工,守望着 the 龙口, suddenly said:

"The Yellow River is乏了! 没有劲了!"

When the solemn moment of切断 the Yellow River is临迫, people are无所畏惧, also睡不着 - the burden is重啊! As long as you打 with the Yellow River for a few回合, you will顿时信心百倍, as if the strength of the entire Yellow River has跑 to your own body. Time has also become格外宝贵. China has so many大江大河, everywhere is修筑 water conservancy projects. The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, this world water conservancy project twenty times larger than Sanmenxia, is still waiting for people to攀登. If it takes fifteen days to截 one Shenhe, it's还得了!

Time, time, what决定一切 is still time! How many people are still预计 the moment when the截流高潮到来, how many people are still designing technical plans for进占 Shenhe, how many people are still等着 注定的失败. But suddenly, at 6:45 a.m. on November 25, 1958 - the spur dike飞斩千尺浪: Shenhe断流了! The Shenmen River mouth and the Shenmen Overflow Channel are both切断了! Sanmenxia can no longer see the激流 of恣意狂奔! The first幸福的黎明 of the Yellow River开始了!

In Sanmenxia, to cut off the world's most凶猛暴烈大河, it only took eight days, only nearly 40,000 cubic meters of块石 and 168块 concrete四面体 were抛投. This is没有先例的.

"The world level is only切断 the Yellow River?" Party Secretary Zhang Haifeng said this on the eve of the decisive battle. At that time, we were not afraid of the "international level," but we did not expect to create the world's first, we only wanted to截断 the Yellow River. But one截就截出了 a world's first, those "international levels" are even more tasteless.

"This is the world's first?" Cutoff Deputy Chief Commander Xie Hui said: "It doesn't seem to费多大事啊! If this is called the world's first, isn't the world's first under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party all up to you to搞吗?"

"If you search all over the British Isles, you can't find a small river 300 kilometers long, and you can't make a hydroelectric station,没比头; the United States has a lot of big rivers, but the one Boulder hydroelectric station took forty years to build, and the time for the麦克纳瑞 River cutoff alone is enough for us to截断 two Shenhes,没比头. - Once Shenmen is断流, even if Sanmenxia跃进 for another year, it will be嫌 too slow." Nature has赐 we this伟大的河流, when we把万里黄河控 in our hands, how much can it give us! "Yellow River large练兵, Three Gorges創奇迹." We not only want water, electricity, grain, and land from the Yellow River. We also want time. We want to骑上黄河飞跑, 骑上黄河追赶 time! We want to骑上黄河跑上 the Three Gorges绝顶! We want to骑上黄河追太阳!

    神河断流
    本报特约记者  华山
    黄河落天走东海、万里写入胸怀间。——李　白
    世界上有许多动人的神话和传说。当大自然的威力还驾凌一切的时候，人们常常用神的力量来抒发自己的梦想和希望。唯独大禹治水的传说，这个歌颂洪荒时代的英雄诗篇，不是用神而是用人的形象来概括人们征服黄河的美好愿望和英雄气魄。三门峡的艄公说得好：“胆小的人，黄河上没有他的路；有黄河就有敢治黄河的人。”中国人民几千年来就是用黄河的惊涛骇浪来磨炼性格的。
    人们把黄河叫做“害河”，“孽龙”，“败家子”，把黄河的洪水比喻最大的灾难。可是都没有说出中国人民对于黄河的深厚感情。正如黄河下游的一个妇女人民代表所说：
    “我们怕它，恨它，怨它，骂它，又舍不得离开它。打从我记事起，母亲便背上我跑黄河，我会走路了，父亲牵上我的小手跑黄河；后来我结了婚，有了孩子，我又背上自己的小孩跑黄河。可是洪水一退，我们又回来了。我们世世代代就是离不开黄河啊。没想今天我们要亲手治住黄河了。”
    从世界屋顶下的巴颜喀拉山到太平洋西岸的渤海湾，黄河这样颠狂，暴烈，在亚洲大陆上奔流万里。洪水一来，几千亩地眼巴巴看着便被掠走了。顷刻间一片汪洋，历代多少著名的河流与城市都被吞没，荡平，深埋地下了。可是洪水一退，又是千里沃野，撒下种子便是丰年。引一股黄水，百里沙荒就喂肥了。中国大平原就是黄河把黄土高原搬到海里填成的。黄河里流的不是浊浪，而是土地，是庄稼，是浸透了血泪的乳汁啊！
    黄河！黄河！你以文明古国的“文化摇篮”闻名于世界，用移山填海的气魄横贯中国大陆，暴烈的性格里深藏着慈母的心怀。当我们今天要把你抓在手里的时候，还有什么壮丽的图画能比眼前的惊涛骇浪更能激起人们的雄心呢！
    我们要喝令黄河让路！
    我们要锁住黄河！
    我们要把万里黄河捏在手里！
    是黄河终于低下头来，还是暴怒的河水终于把戗堤冲垮了？这是一场分秒必争的恶战。为了这一场扭转黄河历史的大决战，一个激动心弦的战斗口号日日夜夜在人们心里沸腾着。
    黄河似乎也预感到决战的时刻到了，河水总是不肯消退。已经到了11月中旬，流量还是停留在二千秒公方以上。超过截流的设计流量一倍。今年秋天碰到了五十年一遇的丰水年。
    成万吨的大小岩石，以每分钟一大卡车的速度向激流中心猛泻着。
    正当峡谷进口的鬼门岛，这是大决战的指挥中心，也是总攻击的进攻出发地，截流指挥台俯临危崖，截流公路从危崖下直迫神门河口。这就是三门峡的主流神门河，鬼门岛和神门岛之间的激流中心的禁区。五十七台自卸汽车日夜不停地奔驰着，满载着一车车的岩石，从右岸横过鬼门溢流桥，驰上鬼门岛，一直开到危崖下的公路尽头，堆筑着指向对岸的戗堤。
    三门峡摆开了锁住黄河的阵势……
    一连三天，强大的车队日夜奔驰着，这样勇猛，迅速，准确，而又有节奏。虽然来来去去，都要经过窄窄的鬼门溢流桥和危崖下的进占公路。第一天抛投的石料就达到六千方，平均每分钟一大卡车。超过了设计要求二分之一。20日第一个钟头，堆筑起来的戗堤已经直插河心十二公尺。黄河暴怒了！万里黄河集中了它的主力，冲进神门，恨不得把两岸石壁和戗堤一气冲塌似的。时间就是一切。进攻的速度加快了，五十秒一车，四十秒一车，三十秒一车；载重十吨的，十二吨的，三台汽车并排着向河心猛击；刚从苏联赶来的二十五吨大“玛斯”也投入战斗了。可是多大的石头，总是站不住脚，好容易露出水面一点，又冲跑了，刚刚填平一角浪窝，又陷落了。整整八个钟头，戗堤毫无进展。“国际水平论”简直暴跳起来。
    “在这样大的流量截流，根本就是错误！犯罪！非失败不可！”
    可是什么“国际水平”又有过我们这样的人呢，谁见过这样的截流汽车，一俯冲就到了龙口跟前，一掉头就运到戗堤尖端，一车车石料都是直接卸到河里？谁见过这样的机械群，既没有后备的机车，也没有成套的备品，一连八昼夜都全部投入战斗，从没让汽车在料场空等一分钟？谁见过这样的推土机，在戗堤上就像飞的一样，只一刀便把堤头推平，一倒闸又立刻给汽车闪出冲锋道路，前进后退都是开的五档快车？谁见过这样的龙口突击队，脚下就是淘刷着堤根的狂流，后面就是直搏河心的汽车，他们在夹缝里钻空子抢修道路，手下的堤头总是这样坚固，平整？谁又见过这样的截流指挥员，一没进过大学，二没学过工程，只是在工地滚上一年，工程专家不敢决定的问题，他们决定了，工程专家拿不出的技术措施，他们拿出来了，而且这样快，就在戗堤毫无进展的时候，进占的办法就出来了呢？
    在神门河口的下游，正当三股激流冲击喷射的中心，一柱石壁傲然屹立着，这就是古来闻名的“中流砥柱”，中国民族性格的象征。三门峡的艄公把它叫做“照我来”。几千年来，黄河的船夫在三门峡找到了一条大路，这条路，就是骑着大浪冲击。哪怕迎面劈来的石壁眼看就把木船碰碎，也要顽强，坚持，勇往直前。“照我来”就是神圣的召唤。就在劈头猛撞的刹那间，大浪从石壁反扑回来，把木船拖过一边，——正好在悬崖峭壁的夹胡同里顺流而下。粉身碎骨的险境也变成破浪前进的坦途了。
    猛攻神河的人，正是这种在困难面前，充满自信的人。正是工程专家们看不上眼的截流指挥人员，从千军万马找到力量和信心，从当面的困难看出胜利的道路。“黄河上没有回头路，”不向前猛攻是站不住脚的。硬顶着激流的上游堤角是全力争夺的焦点，也是猛攻神河的“冲锋阵角”；下游堤角是激流迂回包抄的“侧翼阵角”。巨大块石和混凝土四面体组成了连续突击的冲锋部队，两路出击，一路抢占前进的要点，一路稳住侧翼阵角；小块石是支援冲锋和占领阵地的主力部队，一旦两角露出水面，立刻趁势扩展堤头的“主阵地”，掩护两角的冲锋。黄河下游人民创造的“葡萄串”和铅丝石笼，是出色的“战斗小组”和“坚守部队”，你把这块冲跑，那块就拖住了，你把那块冲跑，这块又拖住了；一扒住堤坡就把整个阵脚稳住，沉到水底也要占领住水底的阵角。顽强执着如同猛攻神河的人们。
    11月20日白天，是淘刷坍塌最凶的一天，也是戗堤进占最快的一天。21日晨七时，戗堤已经横断河口二十二公尺，把神门河的脖子掐得紧紧的。激流一旦挣出龙口，只吼的山摇地动，满河浪花。“油沫锅”从未有过这样暴跳如雷而又乱成一团的浪花。守望着龙口的老河工忽然说：
    “黄河乏了！没有劲了！”
    当切断黄河的庄严时刻临迫的时候，人们无所畏惧，也睡不着，——担子重啊！只要和黄河打上几个回合，顿时信心百倍，好像整条黄河的力气都跑到了自己身上似的。时间也变得格外宝贵了。中国有这许多大江大河，到处都在修筑水利工程。长江三峡这个二十倍于三门峡的世界水利工程的绝顶还等待着人们攀登。一条神河要截上十五天还得了！
    时间，时间，决定一切的还是时间！多少人还在预计着截流高潮到来的时刻，多少人还在设计着进占神河的技术方案，多少人还在等着注定的失败。可是突然，1958年11月25日黎明6点45分，——戗堤飞斩千尺浪：神河断流了！神门河口和神门溢流道都切断了！三门峡再也看不到恣意狂奔的激流了！万里黄河第一个幸福的黎明开始了！
    在三门峡切断世界上最凶猛暴烈的大河，只用八天时间，只抛投了近四万方的块石和一百六十八块混凝土四面体。这是没有先例的。
      “世界水平，也不过是把黄河切断呢？”党委书记张海峰同志在决战的前夕曾经这样说。当时，我们不怕“国际水平”，可也没想到创造世界第一，我们只想截断黄河。可是一截就截出个世界第一，那些“国际水平”更没味道了。
      “这就是世界第一？”截流副总指挥谢辉同志说：“好像也没费多大事啊！这也叫世界第一，在中国共产党领导下的世界第一不是尽你搞吗？”
    “找遍英伦三岛，找不到三百公里长的一条小河，弄不出什么水电站来，没比头；美国大河倒不少，可是一个波尔德水电站就修了四十年，光是麦克纳瑞河截流中断的时间就够我们截断两条神河的，也没比头。——神门一断流，三门峡再跃进一年也嫌太慢了。”大自然赐给我们这样伟大的河流，当我们把万里黄河控在手心的时候，它能给我们多少东西！“黄河大练兵，三峡创奇迹。”我们不光向黄河要水、要电、要粮、要土地。我们还要时间。我们要骑上黄河飞跑，骑上黄河追赶时间！我们要骑上黄河跑上三峡的绝顶！我们要骑上黄河追太阳！
