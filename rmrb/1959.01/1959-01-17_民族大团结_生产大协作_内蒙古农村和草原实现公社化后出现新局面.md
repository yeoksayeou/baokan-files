(Reported by our newspaper from Hohhot on January 16th) A new situation of great unity among nationalities and great collaboration in production has emerged in the rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia after the realization of people's communes.

In the people's commune movement, many rural communes and pastoral communes have gradually strengthened their ties and engaged in agricultural and pastoral production collaboration. When agricultural areas such as Wuyuan County, Linhe County, and Buteha Banner lacked fuel and fertilizer, pastoral communes in areas such as Urad Middle and Rear Joint Banner and Chen Barag Banner collected more than one billion jin of cattle and sheep manure and transported it to provide support. The pastoral area of ​​Balin Right Banner also dispatched more than 1,300 ox carts to help nearby farmers rush to deliver grain, speeding up the entry of public grain into storage. Communes in the agricultural areas of Bayannur League and Xilin Gol League raised a large amount of feed, forage, and fine breeds of livestock for the pastoral areas, and sent technicians to the neighboring pastoral communes to assist in their work. In some areas, Mongolian herders and Han farmers also jointly cultivated satellite fields, harvested feed crops, and engaged in disaster prevention and livestock protection.

After the establishment of communes in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, the original boundaries of townships and cooperatives were broken, and unified allocation of manpower and animal power was implemented, and unified planning and management of agricultural, pastoral, forestry, and sideline production was carried out. This made ethnic group members more closely cooperate in collective labor, helping each other, sharing resources, learning from each other's strengths, and making progress together. The "May 1st" National United Commune in Ar Horqin Banner was formed by the union of thirteen Mongolian and Han agricultural cooperatives and two Han agricultural cooperatives. The original Red Star Cooperative had more Mongolian members and poorer agricultural production technology. During the autumn harvest, there was a shortage of labor. The original Han cooperative dispatched more than 60 people to help with the harvest, saving the crops from wind damage and achieving a bumper harvest. The original Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Buteha Banner consisted of Korean members who were good at growing rice, but there were only sixteen laborers. In the past, the area planted with rice was not large, and it was even more difficult during the busy farming season. After communization, they merged with three Daur agricultural cooperatives and one Han agricultural cooperative to establish a work area. Now it has been decided to expand the rice area by more than two times, and they are preparing for Korean members to help Daur and Han members learn rice planting techniques. In the national unity township of Xinghe County, there is a lot of wasteland, but because the land rights belong to Mongolian members, it is not easy to deal with. After the township established the commune, the Mongolian members took the initiative to hand over these wastelands to the commune. The commune immediately mobilized members to cultivate more than 1,000 mu of irrigated land, and at the same time closed some slopes as pastures, which created very good conditions for the commune to further develop agricultural and animal husbandry production.

    民族大团结　生产大协作
    内蒙古农村和草原实现公社化后出现新局面
    本报呼和浩特16日电　在实现了人民公社化的内蒙古农村和草原上，出现了民族大团结和生产大协作的新局面。
    在人民公社化运动中，有许多农村公社和牧区公社就逐渐加强彼此间的联系，进行农牧生产协作。当五原县、临河县、布特哈旗等农业区缺乏燃料和肥料的时候，乌拉特中后联合旗、陈巴尔虎旗等地牧区公社就收集十亿多斤牛羊粪，运往支援。巴林右旗牧区还抽调一千三百多辆牛车，帮助附近农民突击送粮，加快了公粮入库速度。巴彦淖尔盟、锡林郭勒盟农业区的公社，给牧区筹集了大量的饲料饲草优良种畜，并派出技术人员，到邻近的牧区公社去协助工作。有些地区的蒙古族牧民和汉族农民还共同进行耕种卫星田、收割饲料作物和防灾保畜等劳动。
    内蒙古农业区和半农半牧区建立公社以后，由于打破了原来乡社的界限，实行统一调配人力、畜力，统一规划和管理农牧林副等生产，使各民族社员在集体劳动中更加亲密合作，做到互相帮助，互通有无，取长补短，共同跃进。阿鲁科尔沁旗“五一”民族联合公社，是由十三个蒙汉民族联合农业社和两个汉族农业社联合组成的。原红星社蒙古族社员较多，农业生产技术较差，秋收时劳动力不足，原汉族社便抽调六十多人前往帮助收割，使庄稼免遭风害，获得了丰收。布特哈旗原光明农业社都是朝鲜族社员，善于种植水稻，但只有十六个劳动力，以往种水稻面积不大，农忙时更感到困难；公社化以后，他们同三个达斡尔族农业社、一个汉族农业社合并建立作业区，现在决定把水稻面积扩大两倍多，并准备由朝鲜族社员帮助达斡尔族、汉族社员学会种植水稻的技术。兴和县民族团结乡境内荒地很多，但因地权属于蒙古族社员，不好处理。这个乡成立公社后，蒙古族社员主动地把这些荒地交给公社，公社立即动员社员开垦了一千多亩水浇地，同时封闭了一些坡梁地作为牧场，这样，给公社进一步发展农牧业生产创造了很好的条件。
