How to Achieve High Yield Targets?
——The Experience of Leading the Three Wheat Harvest in Changshu County, Jiangsu
Liang Guangjing, Jiang Weicai

"Ten-point targets, twelve-point measures" is a leadership experience that the Changshu County Party Committee in Jiangsu Province explored during the pre-winter to spring production campaign. This experience is in line with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which pointed out that "soaring enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis."

The so-called ten-point target is an advanced target that has both revolutionary spirit and reliable practicality; the twelve-point measures include not only technical measures, but also detailed organizational work and powerful political and ideological work measures; it is a leadership art to not only lead the masses to work hard, practically, and skillfully, but also to maintain a strong fighting spirit wave after wave. The Changshu County Party Committee went through a arduous struggle in the process of obtaining this experience.

This struggle was reflected in the first battle of "Three Wheat Catching up with Rice."

	Breaking Thousands of Years of Convention in One Day

On the basis of the high tide of the 1957 winter production campaign, the Changshu County Party Committee fully studied the growth of wheat seedlings at that time and the typical experiences of high wheat yields over the years. With a revolutionary spirit, it crushed thousands of years of conventions and put forward the revolutionary target of "Three Wheat Catching up with Rice, Rice Doubling." The process of proposing this revolutionary target was actually a process of combining leadership and mass demands, a process of struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and a process of combining revolutionary spirit and realistic spirit. At that time, one production campaign followed another, and the county party committee continuously put forward new targets, but they were broken by the masses time and time again. The proposal of the revolutionary target of "Three Wheat Catching up with Rice, Rice Doubling" greatly encouraged the promoters on the one hand, but on the other hand, it encountered resistance from various forms of right-leaning thoughts. Some people clung to old conventions, some were skeptical, some simply did not believe it, and even openly opposed it. They said, "This is a myth. How can three wheat compare with rice since ancient times?" Others said, "Eating too fast will choke, and walking too fast will fall," trying their best to oppose it. These conservative ideas showed that the habitual force of always regarding three wheat as a "low-yielding crop" was deeply rooted in people's minds. In order to completely eliminate the outdated concept of "low-yielding three wheat" from people's minds and unify the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses, the county party committee launched a large-scale debate involving the whole party and the whole people. The center of the debate was: Should three wheat catch up with rice? Can it catch up? Dare to catch up? How to catch up? All localities used the high-yield facts and experiences of local old farmers, model farmers, and others to powerfully refute skepticism, giving cadres and the masses a profound political and ideological education, and powerfully guiding and organizing cadres and the masses to move forward towards new goals and new requirements, inspiring greater enthusiasm.

	Three Breaks and Three Establishments

With revolutionary targets, there should be revolutionary measures to follow. At that time, although many technical measures were put forward, the actions of many townships and communes were still slow. The county party committee studied this situation and began to realize that without a change in the work style of cadres, it would be impossible to better mobilize the masses to achieve revolutionary targets.

The county party committee, based on materials from various sources, analyzed that there were still three bad habits in the ideological work style of cadres that had not been completely eradicated: First, the "musty air" of right-leaning conservatism could not keep up with the Great Leap Forward; second, the "delicate air" of being greedy for comfort and afraid of hardship; third, the "greasy air" of not keeping promises and discounting the implementation of work. In response to this situation, the county party committee summarized the three good qualities of cadres in advanced areas: First, the ambition to leap forward boldly; second, the courage to not be afraid of difficulties; and third, the vitality of being full of vigor. On this basis, the county party committee launched a rectification movement of "three breaks and three establishments" among cadres. It was clearly proposed to break "musty air, delicate air, and greasy air" and establish "courage, ambition, and vitality."

After the "three breaks and three establishments" rectification movement, cadres at the township and commune levels throughout the county generally strengthened their determination and sense of responsibility in leading production. After the rectification, the cadres of Meili Township all went to the fields to produce together with the masses. The fertilizer accumulation campaign and wheat field management work throughout the township were in full swing, and the scale and momentum became larger and larger, and it was continuously rated as a red flag township twice. The masses were very happy and wrote a poem saying: "The wind is gentle and the sun is warm, the spring scenery is good, turning the world upside down to accumulate fertilizer. Who says Meili's energy is not high, strive for three wheat to catch up with rice!" The masses vividly described: There are thousands of measures to increase production, and the leading cadres taking the lead is the first.

	One Sitting, Three Ignitions

After the cadres changed their work style, the masses immediately showed soaring enthusiasm. In order to maintain the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, make the advanced even more advanced, and help the backward catch up, a three-banner comparison and competition was launched throughout the county.

This three-banner comparison and competition movement is not only a comprehensive work inspection and comparison, but also an inspection and comparison of the leadership thinking and leadership methods of party committees at all levels. The development of inspection and comparison has promoted an all-round leap forward in thinking, production, and work, and has become a driving force for people to continuously move forward. For example, in the three-banner comparison and competition in Baimao Township, each banner was written with eight large characters: The flag sent to the upstream teams was written with: "Take the lead, create miracles again." The flag sent to the midstream teams was written with: "Whip the horse, be careful of falling behind." The flag sent to the downstream teams was written with: "Summon up your energy, don't be discouraged." Doing so has a great effect on urging the advanced not to be proud and to continue to develop the advanced; and for the backward to be determined to become strong and catch up quickly. For example, after Guli Township was rated as a "lagging township," the township party secretary did not sleep all night, repeatedly thinking about the reasons for lagging behind. The next day, he launched a debate among cadres and the masses: Why are other townships doing well, and why are we not doing well? How to do well? After the masses compared accounts and found out the reason for lagging behind: "Measures have not kept up with the targets," they formulated a detailed plan for ten production items. After ten days of hard and skillful work, the "lagging behind" label was removed in the second comparison.

In carrying out the three-banner comparison and competition, all localities linked grasping the advanced with grasping the backward, and adopted the method of "one sitting, three ignitions," which not only promoted the advanced, but also powerfully drove the backward. "One sitting" means that township and commune cadres "sit" in the backward teams, take the lead in setting an example, and do not leave until the situation is changed (but do not stay at one point). "Three ignitions" means: Timely disseminate heroic model stories, igniting the fire of overcoming difficulties; set up advanced banners, organize visits, igniting the fire of burning conservative ideas and complacency; formulate plans, carry out small-scale single-item competitions, more comparisons, frequent inspections, igniting the fire of making the advanced even more advanced and the backward catching up with the advanced.

	Seizing Three Barriers to Protect Seedlings and Ears

In the process of striving for high wheat yields, with political leadership, technical measures are also needed to keep up. Politics and technology are like two wings, both indispensable. According to local natural conditions and the historical law of climate change, Changshu County proposed the slogan of "Apply a large amount of top dressing, supplement the acquired deficiencies, seize three barriers (cold wave, rain and waterlogging, diseases and insect pests), and protect seedlings and ears" in terms of technical measures, and organized four decisive battles from winter to summer.

The first battle was to apply a large amount of winter fertilizer, carefully process and manage, protect the three wheat to safely overwinter, and promote early tillering of wheat seedlings. Last year, around the Spring Festival, the masses were mobilized to fully invest in the struggle against the cold, covering seedlings with straw, firewood fans, curtains, etc. In some places, river mud, manure ash, and garbage were used to press the wheat. Therefore, three cold wave attacks were overcome, and the wheat seedlings in the whole county were basically unharmed, achieving full seedlings, strong seedlings, early rooting, and early tillering.

The second battle was to apply a large amount of spring fertilizer and strengthen field management to increase the number of first and second-class seedlings and change the growth of third-class seedlings. The 470,000 mu of second and third-class seedlings in the county have all caught up with first-class seedlings after processing and management.

The third battle was to open ditches for drainage and lower the water level of inland rivers, turning low-lying fields into high-yielding fields. In the high-lying fields area, more than 4 million wheat field ditches and drainage ditches were dredged, so that small ditches communicated with large ditches, and large ditches communicated with rivers, and the fields were dry after the rain stopped. The farmers very much agreed with this measure.

The fourth battle was the whole party and the whole people organizing a blitzkrieg against diseases and insect pests. Last year, continuous spring rains caused unprecedented serious diseases during the flowering and heading stage of three wheat. In response to this situation, the county and township immediately established a headquarters to ensure a bumper harvest of three wheat, and put forward the action slogan of "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, and fighting diseases is like fighting the enemy," organizing a pest control commando team of more than 200,000 people.

This battle of "Three Wheat Catching up with Rice" broke the prejudice that people have followed for thousands of years that "small maturity cannot produce a large harvest," and turned small maturity into a large maturity. Practice has proved that historically high-yield areas can leap forward, and historically low-yield areas can also leap forward. For example, Julun Cooperative in Tangqiao Township, which has historically had high yields of three wheat, had an average yield of 408 jin per mu of three wheat last year, an increase of 2.4 times compared with 1957. Tangshi Township, which has historically had low yields, had an average yield of 301 jin per mu last year, an increase of 2.6 times compared with 1957. Last year, Changshu County had 850,000 mu of three wheat, with an average yield of 311.6 jin per mu, an increase of 142% compared with 1957, and the total output increased by 111.46 million jin compared with 1957.

    怎样实现高产指标？
    ——江苏常熟县领导三麦丰收的经验
    梁光景　姜韦才
    “十分指标，十二分措施”是江苏常熟县委在前冬去春生产运动中摸索出来的一条领导经验。这条经验，正符合了党的八届六中全会所指出的“冲天干劲必须和科学分析相结合”的精神。
    所谓十分指标，就是既有革命精神又有可靠现实性的先进指标；十二分措施则不仅包括技术上的措施，而且包括周密的组织工作和强有力的政治思想工作的具体措施；既要领导群众苦干实干巧干，又要一浪高一浪地始终保持旺盛的斗志，这是一项领导艺术。常熟县委在获得这一条经验的过程中，是经过了一番艰苦斗争的。
    这一场斗争，一开始就反映在“三麦赶水稻”的第一个战役中。
        千年常规一日破
    在1957年冬季生产运动高潮的基础上，常熟县委充分研究了当时麦苗的生长情况和历年来出现的三麦高产典型经验以后，以革命的精神，冲垮了千年陈规，提出了“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的革命指标。这个革命指标提出的过程，实际上是领导与群众要求相结合的过程、先进思想与落后思想斗争的过程、革命精神与求实精神相结合的过程。当时，生产运动一个高潮接着一个高潮，县委不断地提出新的指标，但一次又一次地被群众突破。“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的革命指标的提出，一方面大大鼓舞了促进派，另一方面却又遇到了形形色色右倾思想的抵抗。有人死抱住老常规不放，有人半信半疑，有人根本不相信，甚至公开反对。他们说：“这是神话，自古以来三麦哪能和水稻相比。”还有的人说什么“吃饭快了要噎，走路快了要跌”，竭力反对。这些保守思想表明：一向把三麦看成“低产作物”这个习惯势力，在人们头脑中扎得很深。为了从人们的思想上彻底扫除“三麦低产”的陈腐观念，统一干部和群众的思想认识，县委发动了一次规模浩大的全党全民大辩论。辩论的中心是：三麦要不要赶水稻？能不能赶？敢不敢赶？怎么样赶？各地都用本乡本社的老农、丰产模范等高产事实和经验，有力地驳倒了怀疑论，使干部群众受到一次深刻的政治思想教育，有力地引导和组织干部群众向着新的目标、新的要求、鼓起更大的干劲不断前进。
      三破三立
    有了革命的指标就应该有革命的措施跟上去。当时，虽提出了不少技术上的措施，但许多乡社的行动还是很迟缓。县委研究了这个情况，开始意识到干部作风不转变，就不可能更好地发动群众实现革命指标。
    县委便根据各方面的材料，分析了干部思想作风上还有三个坏气没有彻底根除：一是右倾保守思想跟不上大跃进的“霉气”；二是贪图安逸，怕吃苦的“娇气”；三是说到做不到，执行工作打折扣的“油气”。县委针对着这个情况，又总结了先进地区干部思想作风的三个好气：一是大胆跃进的志气；二是不怕困难的勇气；三是生龙活虎的朝气。在这个基础上，县委就在干部中开展了一次“三破三立”的整风运动。明确提出破“霉气、娇气、油气”，立
  “勇气、志气、朝气”。
    全县乡社干部经过“三破三立”的整风运动，普遍加强了领导生产的决心和责任心。梅李乡干部在整风后，个个下田和群众一起生产。全乡积肥运动和麦田管理工作搞得热火朝天，规模声势愈来愈大，连续两次被评为红旗乡。群众很高兴地作了一首诗说：“风和日暖春光好，翻天复地积肥料。谁说梅李劲不高，争取三麦赶水稻！”群众生动地形容：增产措施千万条，干部带头是第一条。
        一坐三点火
    干部转变作风以后，群众中立即出现了冲天的干劲。为了保持群众的革命干劲，使先进的更加先进，并帮助落后的赶上去，又在全县开展了三旗评比竞赛。
    这种三旗评比竞赛运动，既是全面的工作检查评比，又是各级党委领导思想、领导方法的检查评比。检查评比的发展，促使了思想、生产、工作全面跃进，成为推动人们不断前进的动力。例如白茆乡的三旗评比竞赛，每面旗上都写着八个大字：送给上游社队的旗上写的是：“一马当先，再创奇迹”。送给中游社队的旗上写的是：“快马加鞭，当心掉队”。送给下游社队的旗上写的是：“鼓足干劲，不要泄气”。这样做，对促使先进的不骄傲，继续发扬先进；落后的奋发图强，急起直追，有很大作用。如古里乡在被评为“掉队乡”以后，乡党委书记一夜没睡，反复寻思掉队的原因，第二天就发动干部群众开展辩论：别的乡为什么做得好，我们为什么做得不好？怎样做得好？经过群众对比算账，找出了“措施没有跟上指标”的掉队的原因，制定了十项生产的详细规划。经过十天苦干巧干，第二次评比就摘掉了“掉队落后”的帽子。
    各地在开展三旗评比竞赛中，都把抓先进与抓落后联系起来，采取了“一坐三点火”的办法，既发扬了先进，又有力地带动了落后。“一坐”是乡社干部“坐镇”落后社队，自己带头做出样子，不改变面貌不走（但不孤守一点）。“三点火”是：及时传播英雄模范事例，点起克服困难之火；树立先进旗帜，组织参观，点起烧毁保守思想、自满情绪之火；订出计划，开展小段单项竞赛，多评比、常检查，点起先进更先进，落后赶上先进之火。
  抢三关保苗穗
    在争取三麦高产的过程中，有了政治挂帅，还需要紧紧跟上技术措施。政治与技术，好像两只翅膀，缺一不可。常熟县根据当地自然条件和气候变化的历史规律，在技术措施方面，提出了“大量追肥，补足后天，抢渡三关（寒流、雨涝、病虫），保苗保穗”的口号，从冬到夏，组织了四个有决定意义的战役。
    第一个战役是大量追施腊肥，认真加工管理，保护三麦安全过冬，促使麦苗提早分蘖。去年，春节前后，发动群众全力投入抗寒斗争，用稻草、柴扇、帘子等盖苗，有的地方用河泥、厩灰、垃圾压麦，因此，战胜了三次寒流袭击，全县麦苗基本无恙，做到全苗、壮苗、盘棵早、分蘖早。
    第二战役是大量追施春肥，加强田间管理，提高一、二类苗，转变三类苗的生长情况。全县的四十七万亩二、三类苗经过加工管理，都赶上了一类苗。
    第三个战役是开沟排水，降低内河水位。变低田为高田，变低产为高产。高田地区疏通了四百多万条麦田沟和排水沟，做到小沟通大沟，大沟通河道，雨停田干。农民对这条措施非常赞成。
    第四个战役全党全民组织抗病治虫突击运动。去年春雨连绵，在三麦扬花吐穗期发生了从来没有过的严重病害。针对着这一情况，县与乡立即成立了确保三麦丰收的指挥部，提出“保苗如保命，抗病如抗敌”的行动口号，组织二十多万人的治虫突击队。
    这一场“三麦赶水稻”的战斗，打破了人们几千年因袭下来的“小熟不能大收”的偏见，使小熟变成了大熟。实践证明：历来高产地区能跃进，历来低产地区也能跃进。如历年三麦产量高的塘乔乡巨轮社，去年三麦平均单产四百零八斤，比1957年增产二点四培。历年产量较低的唐市乡，去年平均单产三百零一斤，比1957年增产二点六倍。常熟全县去年三麦八十五万亩，平均亩产三百十一点六斤，比1957年增产142％，总产量比1957年增产一亿一千一百四十六万斤。
