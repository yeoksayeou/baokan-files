Xinhua News Agency, 8th - Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Economic Conference, today gave a report on the recent Asian-African Economic Conference held in Cairo.

Nan Hanchen said at a meeting held by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade this morning: "The Asian-African Economic Conference held in Cairo was very successful. The conference resolutions were adopted unanimously by all delegates, fully demonstrating the unity and friendship of business people from Asian and African countries and expressing their common desire to strengthen cooperation and develop their economies. This is the first gathering of Asian and African business circles, and we should not underestimate the achievements of the conference. The conference elected a Consultative Committee (composed of representatives from eleven countries), and under the leadership of the Consultative Committee, the conference secretariat will draft the conference charter and prepare for the Second Asian-African Economic Conference."

Nan Hanchen said: "Although a few delegates at the meeting, standing on the side of imperialism, tried to make trouble, this was not unexpected for us, because imperialists are always unwilling to see a situation of unity, friendship, and cooperation among Asian and African countries. However, their fate is also clear. They have merely exposed their evil faces and intentions once again before the people of Asia and Africa. It was this group of people who left Cairo crestfallen. Newspapers and news agencies in imperialist countries cooperated with this group of troublemakers, wantonly spreading rumors in the newspapers and distorting the facts. For example, the Soviet delegation did not have any proposals, but some news agencies spread rumors that the conference had rejected Soviet proposals; no one at the conference mentioned the so-called Chinese 'dumping' issue, but newspapers spread rumors that several countries jointly proposed opposition to Chinese 'dumping'. These groundless rumors only further exposed their shameless faces."

At today's meeting, the establishment of a Maritime Arbitration Commission within the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade was also approved in accordance with the decision of the State Council, and the Interim Rules of Arbitration Procedure for the Maritime Arbitration Commission of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the list of candidates for this commission were also approved.

The meeting also elected Cai Ziwei, Li Yu, Sun Dagang, Qi Jiannan, Xiang Kefang, and Pan Jingan as members of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

The Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Economic Conference returned to Beijing on the 2nd. The delegation also visited India before returning home.

    南汉宸报告亚非经济会议成就
    亚非各国要求加强经济合作
    帝国主义破坏手法不能得逞
    新华社8日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席、出席亚非经济会议的中国代表团团长南汉宸，今天作了有关最近在开罗召开的亚非经济会议情况的报告。
    南汉宸今天上午在中国国际贸易促进委员会举行的会议上说：“在开罗举行的亚非经济会议开得很成功。大会决议取得了全体代表的一致通过，充分表现了亚非各国工商界人士的团结和友好，表达了加强合作发展经济的共同愿望。这是亚非工商界第一次的聚会，我们不应低估会议的成就。会议上推选出协商委员会（由十一国代表组成），在协商委员会领导下，大会秘书处将草拟大会章则，并筹备第二次亚非经济会议”。
    南汉宸说：“虽然会议上有个别代表站在帝国主义立场上曾设法捣乱，这对我们并不意外，因为帝国主义者总是不愿意亚非国家有一个团结友好合作的局面出现的。但是，他们的下场也是清楚的。他们只不过在亚非人民面前，再一次暴露了自己的邪恶面目和意图。灰溜溜地离开开罗的，就是这一伙人。帝国主义国家的报纸和通讯社曾配合这伙人的捣乱，在报纸上肆意造谣，歪曲事实。例如苏联代表团并未有任何提案，而有些通讯社造谣说会议否决了苏联提案；会议上并没有任何人提起所谓中国‘倾销’问题，而报纸造谣说几个国家联合提案反对中国‘倾销’。这些毫无根据的造谣，只不过更加暴露了他们的无耻面貌而已。”
    在今天的会议上，还根据国务院的决定，通过了在中国国际贸易促进委员会内正式设立海事仲裁委员会，并且通过了中国国际贸易促进委员会海事仲裁委员会仲裁程序暂行规则和这个委员会的人选名单。
    会议还推选蔡子伟、黎玉、孙大光、戚剑南、项克方、潘静安共六人为中国国际贸易促进委员会委员。
    中国出席亚非经济会议代表团是在2日回到北京的，代表团在回国前还访问了印度。
