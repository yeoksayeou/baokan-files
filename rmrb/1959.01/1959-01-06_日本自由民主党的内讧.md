Internal Strife within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party

    The sharp struggle between the "anti-mainstream faction" and the "mainstream faction" within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently reached a temporary compromise on December 30th of last year. Nobusuke Kishi was forced to make superficial concessions, agreeing to "refresh" the party's executive structure around January 10th of this year and to cancel the original plan to re-elect the president on January 17th, deciding that the new executive structure would handle this issue. However, on the same day, the three "anti-mainstream" cabinet members who had already submitted their resignations—State Minister Hayato Ikeda, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency Takeo Miki, and Minister of Education Hirokichi Nadao—refused Kishi Nobusuke's request to withdraw their resignations. It seems that the contradictions between the factions of the Liberal Democratic Party have not been eliminated, and the internal strife will continue to develop.

    "Mainstream Faction" and "Anti-Mainstream Faction"

    The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is a product of factional infighting within the Liberal Democratic Party, a cabinet of united factions. There are now more than ten factions within the Liberal Democratic Party. There are eight main factions, belonging to the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction." The current "mainstream faction" is the ruling faction, with four factions totaling one hundred and seventy-one people. These are the Kishi faction led by Nobusuke Kishi, the Sato faction led by Finance Minister Eisaku Sato, the Kono faction led by Liberal Democratic Party General Council Chairman Ichiro Kono, and the Ohno faction led by Liberal Democratic Party Vice President Banboku Ohno. The "anti-mainstream faction" is the so-called "opposition faction within the party" that opposed Nobusuke Kishi's rise to power, also with four factions totaling one hundred and seventeen people. These are the Ikeda faction led by Hayato Ikeda, the Matsumura-Miki faction led by Takeo Miki and Kenzo Matsumura, the Ishibashi faction led by former Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, and the Ishii faction led by former Deputy Prime Minister Mitsujiro Ishii. Currently, among the eight "mainstream" and "anti-mainstream" factions, the Kishi faction is the most powerful, followed by the Ikeda faction.

    In addition to the eight "mainstream" and "anti-mainstream" factions, there are some weaker "middle-of-the-road factions" that are being courted by both the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction."

    The division between the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is not fixed. Yesterday's "anti-mainstream faction" can become the "mainstream faction" once it seizes power. The reverse is also true. For example, the Ikeda faction, the Ishibashi faction, and the Matsumura-Miki faction, which were the "mainstream faction" during the Ishibashi Cabinet, became the "anti-mainstream faction" after the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet came to power; while the Kishi faction and the Kono faction of the "anti-mainstream faction" became the "mainstream faction." Moreover, it is not always the case that all the "mainstream faction" and all the "anti-mainstream faction" exchange positions one-to-one. For example, the Ishii faction originally supported Ishibashi's rise to power, but later, because Ishibashi did not meet their demand to make Ishii the Deputy Prime Minister, they turned to support Nobusuke Kishi's rise to power. After Nobusuke Kishi came to power, he initially met their demand, but later refused to let Ishii be the Deputy Prime Minister. Therefore, the Ishii faction joined the "anti-mainstream faction."

    Not only do the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction" change frequently, but the members of each faction also change frequently, with many "opportunists" among them. For example, after the general election in May 1958, the number of people in each faction changed. The Kishi faction decreased from seventy-five to sixty-four people; the Sato faction increased from twenty-six to thirty-four people; the Ohno faction increased from twenty-six to thirty-five people; the Kono faction decreased from thirty-nine to thirty-eight people. The Ikeda faction increased from thirty-one to forty-six people; the Matsumura-Miki faction decreased from forty-five to thirty-three people; the Ishibashi faction decreased from twenty to fifteen people; the Ishii faction decreased from twenty-eight to twenty-three people.

    This division and change between the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction" within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party reflects the contradictions and struggles for power and profit within the bourgeois ruling group.

    Struggle for Power and Profit

    The recent struggle between the "anti-mainstream faction" and the "mainstream faction" occurred when the Kishi Nobusuke group suffered setbacks due to the Japanese people's resolute opposition to the reactionary measures of revising the "Police Duties Execution Law." The "anti-mainstream faction" seized the opportunity of Kishi Nobusuke's major fall to launch an offensive, wanting to oust Kishi Nobusuke from power and take power themselves. The focus of the struggle is the date of the public election of the Liberal Democratic Party president and the "refreshing of party style" (replacing the party's leading cadres). According to the post-war Japanese Constitution, the Diet is the highest organ of state power, and the party that holds a majority in the House of Representatives forms the cabinet. The Liberal Democratic Party, which has always held a majority of seats in the Diet, naturally selects its president as the head of the cabinet. Especially since Kishi Nobusuke's rise to power opened the precedent of privately handing over government positions within the Liberal Democratic Party, whichever faction seizes the position of president can control the government.

    Originally, Kishi Nobusuke's term as president was not due to expire until March of this year, and the public election should have been held in March. However, in view of the intensification of internal party struggles, the "mainstream faction" wanted to take advantage of the fact that the joint forces of the "anti-mainstream faction" had not yet been organized to hold the public election of the president ahead of schedule on January 17th of this year. The "anti-mainstream faction" also opposed advancing the re-election in order to gain time to strengthen their offensive forces. As for the issue of replacing the party's leading cadres, the "mainstream faction" advocated doing so after the public election, in order to consolidate its leadership within the party after Kishi Nobusuke's re-election as president. The "anti-mainstream faction" advocated replacing the leading cadres first and then re-electing the president, in order to seize the initiative within the party first and lay the foundation for winning the re-election of the president.

    The ultimate goal of the struggle between the "mainstream" and "anti-mainstream" factions is to strive for power, expand their influence, or make the government favorable to themselves. The "anti-mainstream faction" usually does not express its attitude towards major domestic and foreign policies. Some time ago, when Kishi Nobusuke suffered a setback for proposing the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment," Ishibashi, Matsumura, and others expressed their opposition to revising the "Police Duties Execution Law." Later, the "anti-mainstream faction" repeatedly shouted to hold the "mainstream faction" accountable for the "Police Duties Execution Law" issue. However, Shigeru Yoshida, the big boss of the Ikeda faction, openly said: "In any case, we must find a way to pass this bill." On the issue of revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty," some representatives of the "anti-mainstream faction" believed that "it is too early." As for Shigeru Yoshida, he published an article in the "Sankei Shimbun," talking about "the revised new treaty must develop Japan-US friendly relations more widely on a more solid foundation," and advocating the establishment of an aggressive "Far East Treaty Organization" group. It can be seen that although the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction" have differences in the specific practices of some issues, their basic line of domestic and foreign policies is consistent.

    Inescapable Contradictions

    The origins of the Liberal Democratic Party's factions have been around for a long time. Japan's reactionary bourgeois parties have taken a tortuous path after the war. Since the emergence of the Japan Liberal Party (Ichiro Hatoyama, Shigeru Yoshida) and the Japan Progressive Party (Tadashi Machida, Kijuro Shidehara) in November 1945, more than a dozen parties with various names have gathered and dispersed, and by 1953 and 1954, they had developed into two major parties: the Japan Liberal Party (Bokichi Miki) and the Japan Democratic Party (Ichiro Hatoyama). In November 1956, under the pressure of the growth of people's democratic forces and at the request of the monopoly capitalist group, the two parties merged to form the current Liberal Democratic Party. After the merger, the factional forces of the past were basically preserved and continued to evolve.

    No matter how the factions of the Liberal Democratic Party rise and fall, it is a tool of the monopoly capitalist group and executes the will of the monopoly capitalist group.

    However, there are contradictions within the monopoly capitalist group. With the development of capital concentration, the competition between monopoly capital groups is also intensifying. On the one hand, they want to strengthen the Liberal Democratic Party to serve the entire monopoly capital, and at the same time, each monopoly capitalist and group wants to use it to better satisfy their own interests. Therefore, each monopoly capitalist cultivates its own agents within the factions of the Liberal Democratic Party through political donations and other means. Whether it is the "mainstream faction" or the "anti-mainstream faction," some monopoly capitalists are their backers, or these factional figures themselves are representatives of monopoly capitalists. Among them, Kishi Nobusuke has the widest relationship with monopoly capitalists. His close friend, Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, and his private advisor, Keidanren Vice Chairman Kogoro Uemura, are both famous figures in the monopoly capital group. Masataka Adachi, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Michisuke Sugi, Chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chuhei Itoh, former President of Itochu Corporation, Shigeo Nagano, President of Fuji Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., Shinichi Kojima, President of Yawata Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., and Kensuke Matano, President of Iino Lines, Ltd., are all "financial and business figures of the Kishi faction." For example, Ichiro Kono has a close relationship with the President of Nichiro Fisheries, and is also related to the fisheries, sugar, fertilizer, and other industrial sectors. Takasaki Tatsunosuke (current Minister of International Trade and Industry) of the Kono faction is the Chairman of the Dai Nippon Fisheries Association. Hayato Ikeda is on very intimate terms with Teizo Horikoshi, Director of the Secretariat of the Keidanren, and Tsuneo Okumura, President of Nomura Securities. His influence is deeply rooted in the securities and financial circles.

    In addition, a considerable part of the Liberal Democratic Party represents the interests of local forces and non-monopoly capital core groups. According to statistics from the Japanese "Zen'ei" magazine, in the previous Diet, members of the Liberal Democratic Party who came from local assemblymen or local heads accounted for 24% in the House of Representatives and 19% in the House of Councillors, and those related to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries accounted for 27.3% in the House of Representatives and 14.7% in the House of Councillors. Many of them represent the interests of local banks, large forest owners, and large landowners. They often argue fiercely over issues such as agricultural and forestry budgets, local policies, financial policies, fiscal funds, and tax systems. Because these members all belong to certain factions, this is also a factor that complicates factional infighting.

    Kishi Nobusuke Regime is Precarious

    When Kishi Nobusuke came to power in 1957, he once touted "canceling factional infighting within the party" and "party unity." However, today, factional infighting has not only not eased, but has become increasingly acute and complex. After Kishi Nobusuke came to power for the second time in June 1958, he boasted about "long-term stable political situation" and establishing a solid "Kishi family dynasty." However, now the Kishi Nobusuke government, due to its willingness to act as an accomplice of US aggression and actively implement policies to revive militarism, has been resolutely opposed by the broad masses of the Japanese people, coupled with the infighting within the Liberal Democratic Party, it is already precarious and its situation is becoming increasingly isolated. Even the Japanese bourgeois news agency Kyodo News believes that it will not be stable.

    The precariousness of the Kishi Nobusuke government shows that the rule of the Japanese big monopoly capitalist group is not stable. In the future, with the intensification of the Japanese people's struggle to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke and the aggravation of factional infighting within the Liberal Democratic Party, the Kishi Nobusuke government's situation will become even more untenable.

    日本自由民主党的内讧
    最近日本执政党自由民主党内“反主流派”同“主流派”进行的尖锐斗争，已于去年12月30日呈现暂时的妥协局面。岸信介被迫在表面上作出让步，同意在今年1月10日左右“刷新”党的执行机构，并且取消原订在今年1月17日改选总裁的做法，决定由新的执行机构来处理这个问题。但是同一天，已经提出辞职的国务相池田勇人、经济企划厅长官三木武夫和文部相滩尾弘吉三个“反主流派”阁员，拒绝了岸信介要他们撤回辞呈的要求。看来，自由民主党派系之间的矛盾并没有消除，内讧还会继续发展。
    “主流派”和“反主流派”
    岸信介内阁是自由民主党派系斗争的产物，是几个派系联合的内阁。现在自由民主党内存在十个以上的派系。主要的派系有八个，分属于“主流派”和“反主流派”。现在的
  “主流派”是当权派，有四个派系，一共有一百七十一人。这就是以岸信介为首的岸派、以藏相佐藤荣作为首的佐藤派、以自由民主党总务会长河野一郎为首的河野派、以自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦为首的大野派。“反主流派”是反对岸信介上台的所谓“党内在野派”，也有四个派系，一共一百一十七人。这就是以池田勇人为首的池田派、以三木武夫和松村谦三为首的松村—三木派、以前首相石桥湛山为首的石桥派、以前副首相石井光次郎为首的石井派。现在，“主流”和“反主流”的八个派系中，势力最大的是岸派，其次是池田派。
    除了“主流”和“反主流”的八个派系外，还有一些力量薄弱的“中间派”，它们是“主流派”和“反主流派”争取的对象。
    自由民主党内“主流派”和“反主流派”的划分，并不是固定的。昨天的“反主流派”今天一朝大权在手，便可以成为“主流派”。反之也是一样。例如，石桥内阁时的“主流派”池田派、石桥派和松村—三木派，在岸信介内阁上台后，变成了“反主流派”；而“反主流派”的岸派、河野派则成了“主流派”。而且，有时也不是所有的“主流派”和所有的“反主流派”一对一地掉换位置。比如，石井这一派原来是支持石桥上台的，后来因为石桥没有满足他们让石井当副首相的要求，转而支持岸信介上台。岸信介上台后，先是满足了他们这个要求，但后来又不让石井当副首相了。因此，石井派就加入了“反主流派”。
    不仅“主流派”和“反主流派”经常变动，就是各派系的成员也经常变动，“朝秦暮楚”者大有人在。例如，1958年5月大选后，各派的人数都有变动。岸派从七十五人减为六十四人；佐藤派从二十六人增加到三十四人；大野派从二十六人增为三十五人；河野派从三十九人减为三十八人。池田派从三十一人增为四十六人；松村—三木派从四十五人减为三十三人；石桥派从二十人减为十五人；石井派从二十八人减为二十三人。
    日本自由民主党内部“主流派”和“反主流派”的这种分野和消长反映了资产阶级统治集团内部争权夺利的矛盾和斗争。
    争权夺利
    最近“反主流派”和“主流派”的斗争，是在岸信介集团因修改“警察官职务执行法”的反动措施，遭到日本人民的坚决反对，并受到挫折的情况下发生的。“反主流派”抓住岸信介大栽跟斗的时机，展开攻势，想把岸信介赶下台，由自己当权。斗争的焦点，是公选自由民主党总裁的日期和“刷新党风”（撤换党的领导干部）。按照战后日本宪法，国会是国家最高权力机关，由众议院中占多数的政党组阁。一直把持国会中多数议席的自由民主党，其总裁是组阁首长的当然人选。特别是从岸信介上台后开了在自由民主党内私相授受政府职位的先例，哪一派抓到总裁的位置，它就可以掌握政权。
    本来，岸信介的总裁任期要到今年3月才届满，公选理应在3月举行。但是，“主流派”鉴于党内斗争尖锐化，想趁着“反主流派”联合力量还没有搞好的时候，提前在今年1月17日公选总裁。而“反主流派”也就反对提前改选，以便取得时间加强进攻的力量。至于撤换党的领导干部问题，“主流派”主张在公选后进行，为的是在岸信介连任总裁后更牢固地掌握党内领导权。“反主流派”则主张先撤换领导干部后改选总裁，以便先夺取党内的主动权，为在改选总裁时获胜打下基础。
    “主流”和“反主流”两派斗争的最终目的是争取当权，扩大势力或使政权有利于自己。“反主流派”对国内外重大政策，平时不大表明自己的态度。前些时候，岸信介因提出“警职法修正案”受挫时，石桥、松村等人，曾表示反对修改“警职法”。后来“反主流派”一再叫喊要追究“主流派”在修改“警职法”问题上的责任。但是，池田派的大头子吉田茂却公开说：“无论如何，必须设法通过这个法案。”在修改日美“安全条约”问题上，“反主流派”一些代表人物认为“为时尚早”。至于吉田茂则在“产经新闻”上发表文章，大谈“修改后的新条约必须在更巩固的基础上，更广泛地发展日美友好关系”，并主张成立“远东条约组织”的侵略集团。可见，“主流派”和“反主流派”在某些问题的具体做法上虽有分歧，但它们的国内外政策的基本路线却是一致的。
    无法摆脱的矛盾
    自由民主党的派系渊源由来已久。日本的反动资产阶级政党，在战后走了一段曲曲弯弯的道路。自从1945年11月出现日本自由党（鸠山一郎、吉田茂）、日本进步党（町田忠志、币原喜重郎）两个保守政党后，先后约有十多个名目繁多的党派聚散离合，到了1953年和1954年发展成日本自由党（三木武吉）和日本民主党（鸠山一郎）两大党。到1956年11月，慑于人民民主力量的增长，在垄断资本集团的要求下，两党合并组成现在的自由民主党。合并后，过去的派系势力仍基本上保存下来，并且不断演变。
    万变不离其宗，不管自由民主党的派系消长如何，它都是垄断资本集团的统治工具，执行垄断资本集团的意志。
    但是，垄断资本集团内部并不是没有矛盾的。随着资本集中的发展，垄断资本各集团之间的竞争也在加剧。一方面，它们要加强自由民主党来为整个垄断资本服务，同时各个垄断资本家和集团又都想通过它来更好地满足自己的利益。因此，各个垄断资本家便以政治捐款等方式，在自由民主党各派内培植自己的代理人。无论“主流派”或“反主流派”，都有一些垄断资本家作它们的后台，或者这些派系人物本身就是垄断资本家的代表人物。其中以岸信介同垄断资本家的关系最广。他的好友，外相藤山爱一郎和他的私人顾问、经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎，都是垄断资本集团的著名人物。而日本商工会议所会长足立正、大阪商工会议所会长杉道助、伊藤忠商事公司前总经理伊藤忠兵卫，以及富士制铁公司总经理永野重雄、八幡制铁公司总经理小岛新一、饭野海运公司总经理俣野健辅等人，都是“岸派的金融实业界人士”。又如，河野一郎同日鲁渔业公司总经理有深交，与水产、制糖、肥料及其它等工业部门也有关系。河野派的高碕达之助（现任通商产业相），是大日本水产会会长。池田勇人则同经济团体联合会事务局长堀越桢三、野村证券公司总经理奥村纲雄等人过从甚密。他的势力在有价证券、金融界是根深蒂固的。
    此外，自由民主党内还有相当一部分人，代表地方势力和非垄断资本核心集团的利益。据日本“前卫”杂志统计，上届国会自由民主党议员中，地方议员或地方首长出身的在众议院占24％，在参议院占19％，同农林渔业有关者在众议院占27.3％，在参议院占14.7％。他们当中的许多人代表着地方银行业、大山林主、大地主等的利益。他们在农林预算、地方政策，金融政策、财政资金、税制等问题上，经常争得很厉害。因为这些议员都分属于一定的派系，所以这也是促使派系斗争复杂化的一个因素。
    岸信介政权风雨飘摇
    岸信介在1957年上台时，曾经标榜“取消党内派系斗争”和“党内统一”。但是，到了今天，派系斗争不仅没有缓和，反而日趋尖锐和复杂化。岸信介于1958年6月第二次上台后，大吹大擂要“长期稳定政局”，建立巩固的“岸家天下”。但是，现在岸信介政府由于它甘心充当美国的侵略帮凶并积极执行复活军国主义的政策，而遭到广大日本人民的坚决反对，加上自由民主党内部的倾轧，已经是风雨飘摇，处境日益孤立。连日本的资产阶级新闻机关共同社，也认为它是不会稳定的了。
    岸信介政府的摇摇欲坠，说明日本大垄断资本集团的统治并不稳固。今后，随着日本人民打倒岸信介斗争的激化，以及自由民主党内派系斗争的加剧，岸信介政府的处境将更加不可收拾。　（万峰）
