Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 21st. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a regional meeting of advanced agricultural production units and advanced producer representatives in Urumqi from January 11th to 18th. More than 1,200 representatives from various ethnic groups in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other fields, carefully summarized and exchanged experiences from the Great Leap Forward last year. At the same time, this meeting was also a mobilization rally to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production this year, building on the foundation of the Great Leap Forward last year.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region achieved tremendous success on the agricultural front last year. The rate of grain production increase was equivalent to twelve times the average annual growth rate since liberation. Among the region's fifty-four cotton-producing counties, twelve counties had per unit area yields of ginned cotton exceeding 100 jin.

The autonomous region's animal husbandry also developed. The total number of livestock reached 22.23 million head, an increase of 8.6% compared to 1957. A total of 3.8 million mu of forest were planted throughout the year, 65 times the area of afforestation in 1957. The region expanded its irrigated area by 6.61 million mu, 1.3 times the expansion during the First Five-Year Plan.

Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Saifuddin, Secretary of the Secretariat and Chairman of the Autonomous Region, and Wu Kaizhang, Lü Jianren, and Zeng Di, Secretaries of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Secretariat, all attended and spoke at the meeting.

The meeting, taking into account the specific conditions of the autonomous region, analyzed the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the region this year, and believed that the conditions in the autonomous region in terms of politics, ideology, organization, and material preparation were all better than last year.

The meeting studied the agricultural production policy and the specific measures for implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. In view of the fact that after the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Xinjiang's population will inevitably increase, that herdsmen will need to solve grain and feed problems after implementing the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, that state-owned farms will need to continue to increase, and that the cotton planting area will need to be expanded year by year, except for some areas where there are more arable land and less labor, and where management is indeed difficult, where some land with poor soil can be gradually converted to planting pasture and fruit trees, the cultivated land area will continue to expand from the perspective of the entire autonomous region. This year, Xinjiang will also increase the irrigated area by 7 million mu and improve the irrigated area by 33 million mu through the construction of new water conservancy projects and the reconstruction of old irrigation areas.

The meeting held that people's communes in various parts of the autonomous region should not only implement industry and agriculture side by side, but also agriculture and animal husbandry side by side. All localities must conscientiously do a good job in livestock breeding, and actively and systematically promote intensive breeding methods such as early spring lambing, three litters in two years for sheep, and multiple births. Vigorously improve livestock breeds, and strive to basically improve the breed of sheep this year.

The meeting also passed a letter of salute to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, adopted the Ten Proposals put forward by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, and put forward proposals to the agricultural and pastoral communes and herders of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.

    新疆农业先进单位和生产者代表会议确定
    进一步增加粮棉畜牧生产
    据新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　新疆维吾尔自治区从11日到18日在乌鲁木齐召开了全区农业先进生产单位及先进生产者代表会议。一千二百多名来自天山南北的各民族农业、畜牧业、林业等各方面的代表，认真总结和交流了去年大跃进的经验；同时，这个会议也是在去年大跃进基础上争取今年农牧业生产更大、更好和更全面跃进的誓师大会。
    新疆维吾尔自治区去年在农业战线上取得巨大的成就。粮食增产速度相当于解放以来每年平均增长速度的十二倍，全区五十四个产棉县中，有十二个县皮棉单位面积产量超过一百斤。
    自治区的畜牧业也有了发展。牲畜总头数达到二千二百二十三万头，比1957年增加8.6％；全年造林三百八十万亩，为1957年造林面积的六十五倍。全区共扩大灌溉面积六百六十一万亩，为第一个五年计划期间扩大灌溉面积的一点三倍。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂，书记处书记、自治区主席赛福鼎，自治区党委书记处书记武开章、吕剑人、曾涤等都到会讲了话。
    会议针对自治区的具体情况，分析了自治区今年大跃进的形势，认为今年自治区在政治上、思想上、组织上、物质准备上等各方面的条件都比去年更加好。
    会议研究了农业生产方针和贯彻农业“八字宪法”的具体措施。鉴于兰新铁路通车后，新疆人口势必激增，牧民实行农牧结合后，要解决粮食饲料问题，国营农场要继续增加，棉花面积要逐年扩大等原因，除了一些因耕地多、劳力少、经营确有困难的地区可将一部分土质不好的地逐步地改种牧草和果树外，从整个自治区看，耕地面积要继续扩大。新疆今年还要通过新修水利工程和改建旧灌区，使全区灌溉面积增加七百万亩，改善灌溉面积三千三百万亩。
    会议认为自治区各地人民公社既要实行工业与农业并举，也要实行农业和畜牧业并举。各地必须切实做好牲畜配种工作，积极地、有计划地推行早春产羔、羊只两年三产、多胎等密集繁殖法。大力改良牲畜品种，今年做到绵羊基本良种化。
    会议还通过了向中共中央和毛主席的致敬电，通过了响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议，并向自治区农牧区公社和各族牧民提出了倡议。
