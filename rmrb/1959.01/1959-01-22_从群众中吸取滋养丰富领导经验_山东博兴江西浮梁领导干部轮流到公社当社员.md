Draw Nourishment from the Masses to Enrich Leadership Experience
Leading Cadres in Boxing, Shandong, and Fuliang, Jiangxi, Take Turns Working as Commune Members in People's Communes

Jinan, January 21st (by this newspaper) - The Boxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province made a decision in mid-December last year stipulating that leading cadres of the county should take turns working as commune members in the people's communes in batches, in order to improve their leadership style and enrich their leadership experience. This decision has been valued by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The Provincial Committee forwarded this decision on January 17th and requested that cadres of the prefectural and county organs and the full-time cadres of the communes and production areas should, in conjunction with the rectification of the communes, go down to work as commune members in batches and participate in physical labor training, so as to understand the situation and enrich their knowledge.

The decision of the Boxing County Committee was made under the new situation after practical experimentation. Since the realization of the people's commune system throughout the county, a series of new problems have been raised, from production and life to ideological work. From November to December 1958, the County Committee organized Party secretaries at all levels to carry out the "Four Visits" activity throughout the county, which included visiting public canteens, visiting commune members' families, visiting nurseries, and visiting homes for the elderly. Through the "Four Visits," the leading comrades of the County Committee further realized the importance of going deep into the production process and establishing direct contact and connection with the masses for changing the leadership style and strengthening specific leadership. In order to gain more experience in this regard, the County Committee sent Gao Deming, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, and Zhang Fangying, Deputy County Governor, to the Hubin People's Commune to work as commune members for experimentation before making a formal decision. After Gao Deming and Zhang Fangying arrived at the Hubin Commune, they ate, lived, and worked with the commune members. They developed a very close relationship with the masses. They were greatly inspired in their contact with the masses and also learned about many specific problems. They reported these situations to the County Committee and the Commune Party Committee at any time, which further enriched the leadership experience of the County Committee. Initially, the wage evaluation in this commune was not reasonable enough, and the commune members had opinions; the labor management in the commune also lacked a sound responsibility system. After Gao Deming and Zhang Fangying learned about this situation, they immediately reported it to the Commune Party Committee, so that these problems were quickly and reasonably resolved, and also provided the County Committee with specific experience in grasping this problem.

After summarizing this experience, the County Committee officially made four decisions: (1) The standing committee members of the County Committee and the sixteen正副 County Governors of the County People's Committee shall take turns to be commune members in the production teams of the People's Commune in four batches, and each person shall be a commune member for no less than 50 days a year. (2) All leading cadres of party and government organs and enterprises and institutions throughout the county, except for a few who are old or sick and unable to participate in physical labor, shall make plans, make overall arrangements, and take turns in batches to be commune members, workers, and waiters in people's communes, factory workshops, and business outlets to participate in physical labor training. (3) All comrades participating in physical labor training must put down their airs as cadres, work well, study well, and work well as ordinary laborers, respect leadership, be good commune members, good workers, good waiters, closely unite with the broad masses, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and honestly learn from the masses; at the same time, they should report their work to the Party Committee and the主管 leading department regularly to enrich leadership experience and effectively lead the overall work. (4) All cadres participating in labor training, especially leading cadres, should not only be model laborers, but also strengthen the study of political theory and technical study, and systematically and comprehensively understand the situation of the people's communes, and help local cadres to do a good job in various tasks of the people's communes.

According to Jiangxi Daily news, the Fuliang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to strengthen the specific leadership of the people's communes, decided that all leading cadres in the county should take turns going to the production teams to work as commune members in batches and in stages. The first batch of eighty cadres sent to the lower levels included two County Party Secretaries. The time for going to the lower levels is tentatively set at two months. The Party secretaries and directors of each commune must also go to the production teams to participate in labor for one month each year.

    从群众中吸取滋养丰富领导经验
    山东博兴江西浮梁领导干部轮流到公社当社员
    本报济南21日电　中共山东省博兴县委于去年12月中旬作出决定，规定县的领导干部分批轮流到公社当社员，以便改进领导作风，丰富领导经验。这一决定，受到了中共山东省委的重视。省委在1月17日批转了这一决定，并要求地、县机关和公社、生产区的脱产干部都应当结合整社，分批下去当社员，参加体力劳动锻炼，从而了解情况，丰富自己的知识。
    博兴县委的这一决定，是在新形势下，经过实际试验以后作出的。自从全县实现人民公社化以后，从生产、生活到思想工作，都提出了一系列的新问题。1958年11月到12月间，县委组织各级党委书记在全县开展了访问公共食堂、访问社员家庭、访问托儿所、访问敬老院的“四访”活动。通过“四访”，使县委的领导同志，进一步体会到深入生产过程、与群众建立直接的接触和联系，对于转变领导作风，加强具体领导的重要意义。为了在这方面取得更多的经验，县委在正式作出决定以前，先派县委副书记高德明和副县长张方英，到湖滨人民公社去当社员，进行试验。高德明和张方英到湖滨公社后，便和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。和群众关系搞得非常密切。他们在和群众的接触中，受到很大启发，也了解到很多具体问题。他们把这些情况随时反映给县委和公社党委，进一步丰富了县委的领导经验。开始这个社的工资评的不够合理，社员有意见；社里的劳动管理，也缺乏健全的责任制。高德明和张方英了解到这一情况后，便立即反映给公社党委，使这些问题很快地得到合理解决，也给县委在掌握这个问题上，提供了具体经验。
    县委总结了这段经验后，正式作出了四项决定：（1）县委常务委员和县人民委员会正副县长十六人，分四批轮流到人民公社的生产队当社员，每人每年当社员的时间不少于五十天。（2）全县各级党、政机关和企业、事业部门的全体领导干部，除个别年老和有病不能参加体力劳动的以外，都要做出规划，全面安排，分批轮流到人民公社、工厂车间、营业门市部中当社员、当工人，当服务员，参加体力劳动锻炼。（3）凡参加体力劳动锻炼的同志，都必须放下干部架子，以普通劳动者的姿态，劳动好，学习好，工作好，尊重领导，当一个好社员、好工人、好服务员，密切与广大群众的团结，虚心听取群众意见，老老实实地向群众学习；同时，要定期向党委和主管领导部门作工作汇报，以丰富领导经验，有力地领导全面工作。（4）所有参加劳动锻炼的干部，特别是领导干部既要当模范的劳动者，又要加强政治理论的学习和技术学习，同时要系统全面地了解人民公社的情况，帮助当地干部搞好人民公社的各项工作。
    据江西日报消息　中共浮梁县委为了加强人民公社的具体领导，决定全县所有领导干部分批分期轮流到生产队当社员。第一批下放干部八十人，包括县委书记二人。下放时间暂定两个月。各公社党委书记和社长，每年也要下放到生产队参加劳动一个月。
