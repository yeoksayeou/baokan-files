Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, Leopoldville dispatch: The situation in the Congo remains tense. Leopoldville is virtually under martial law.

The Belgian Governor-General of the Congo, Cornelis, clamored in a broadcast on the 12th, "Any demonstrations will be resolutely and forcefully dealt with in the future."

Troops equipped with automatic weapons, armored vehicles, and armed jeeps have been dispatched to various parts of Leopoldville.

Police have begun searching African residences house by house. African residents deemed to be "illegally" residing in the city will be driven to villages in the jungle. At the same time, the unemployed are being checked. Belgian colonial authorities admitted last week that there are 50,000 unemployed Africans in Leopoldville, which they consider to be one of the causes of the riots.

Reports say that incidents of resistance against colonial rule have occurred in other parts of the Congo besides Leopoldville. In Stanleyville, stones were thrown at colonizers' cars. In Elisabethville, four Africans were arrested for distributing pamphlets against colonial rule.

The colonizers in the Congo are uneasy. They are obtaining gun licenses, housewives are storing food, and many have already bought tickets to return to Europe or temporarily take refuge in neighboring Portuguese colony of Angola. The "African Post" said that they are obviously worried about seeing the turmoil reoccur.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, TASS, Brussels, January 13th: The Belgian newspaper "Red Flag" published a statement by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party on the events in the Belgian Congo. The statement pointed out that the Belgian authorities' attempt to suppress the Congolese people's national liberation movement contains the danger of turning the Congo into a "second Algeria."

The statement said that the Congolese people are participating in the struggle of the people of Asian and African colonies for independence, which is a natural and legitimate process that no one can stop. The Congolese people hope to peacefully resolve the relationship between Belgium and the Congo based on the principles of independence and equality between the two countries. The real solution to the Congo issue is to let the Congo be independent.

The statement pointed out that the current poverty and disenfranchisement of the Congolese residents are the responsibility of the Belgian administrative authorities, which are concerned with loyally serving the interests of the Belgian colonial monopoly capitalists first and foremost.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, Brussels dispatch: Fearing the rising tide of Congolese people's resistance to colonial rule, the Belgian government was forced on the 13th to put forward a vague promise of independence for the Belgian Congo in the future.

In a statement read to both houses of parliament, the government said that Belgium intends to make the Congo a "democratic country capable of exercising sovereignty and deciding its own independence." However, it did not propose a specific date for the Congo's independence, nor did it propose any specific steps to help achieve the Congo's real independence. The government's so-called "Congo Reform Plan" only meticulously stipulated details concerning the so-called "universal suffrage" in the Belgian Congo and the establishment of so-called "Congolese General Assembly" and legislative bodies with "partial legislative power."

Parliament passed the government's above-mentioned plan on the same day.

On the same day, shortly before the government statement was issued, Belgian King Baudouin also made similar empty promises in a radio address. He insisted that because the Congolese people do not yet have "solid and balanced institutions, experienced administrative personnel, and sound social, economic, and financial organizations in the hands of experienced technicians," they cannot achieve independence.

According to him, it seems that eighty years of brutal colonial rule over the Congo has instead given Belgium an "indisputable right" to the Congo. He also insisted that Belgium's "task as guide and advisor" to the Congo "must continue."

    比属刚果局势仍然紧张
    比共发表声明支持刚果人民独立要求
    比政府一面大肆镇压一面开空头支票进行欺骗
    新华社14日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果局势仍然紧张。利奥波德维尔实际上处于戒严状态。
    刚果的比利时总督科内利斯12日在广播中叫嚣说：“今后任何示威游行都将遭到坚决和有力的对付”。
    用自动武器、装甲车和武装的吉普车装备起来的军队，已经被派往利奥波德维尔各地。
    警察开始对非洲人住宅挨户进行搜查。被认为是“非法”居住在这个城市的非洲居民将被赶到丛林中的村庄里去。同时，正在对失业者进行检查。比利时殖民当局上星期承认，利奥波德维尔有五万非洲人失业，他们认为这是发生骚乱的原因之一。
    有消息说，除了利奥波德维尔以外，刚果其他地方也曾发生反抗殖民统治的事件。在斯坦利维尔，有人向殖民者的汽车投掷石头。在伊利沙伯维尔，四个非洲人因为散发反对殖民统治的小册子而被捕。
    在刚果的殖民者情绪不安。他们领取武器执照，家庭妇女都在储藏食品，不少人已经买好票准备回欧洲，或者暂时到邻接的葡萄牙殖民地安哥拉避难。“非洲邮报”说，他们显然很担心看到骚动重新发生。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔13日讯：比利时“红旗报”上发表了比利时共产党中央委员会政治局关于比属刚果事件的声明。声明指出，比利时当局镇压刚果人民民族解放运动的企图包含着把刚果变成“第二个阿尔及利亚”的危险。
    声明说，刚果人民正参加亚洲和非洲各殖民地国家人民争取独立的斗争，这是一个任何人都阻挡不了自然和合法的过程。刚果人民希望按照独立和两国平等的原则和平解决比利时和刚果之间的关系问题。刚果问题的真正解决是要让刚果独立。
    声明指出，刚果居民目前的贫困和无权状况要由比利时行政管理当局负责，它所关心的是首先是忠诚地效劳于比利时殖民主义垄断资本家的利益。
    新华社14日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：慑于刚果人民日益高涨的反抗殖民统治的怒潮，比利时政府13日被迫提出了一项在将来让比属刚果独立的空泛诺言。
  政府在向议会两院宣读的一项声明中说，比利时打算让刚果成为一个“能够行使主权和决定自己的独立的民主国家”。但是它既没有提出让刚果独立的具体日期，也没有提出任何有助于实现刚果真正独立的具体步骤。政府的所谓“刚果改革方案”中只是繁琐地规定了有关在比属刚果进行所谓“普选”和成立所谓“刚果总会议”和立法会议等“具有部分立法权”的机构的细节。
    议会同一天通过了政府提出的上述方案。
    同一天，在政府声明发表前不久，比利时国王博杜安也在广播演说中提出了类似的空洞诺言。他硬说，由于刚果人民目前还没有“巩固而均衡的机构、有经验的行政人员以及掌握在有实际经验的技术人员手里的良好的社会、经济和财政组织”，因此他们还不可能实现独立。
    根据他的说法，似乎八十年来对刚果的残酷殖民统治反而使比利时获得了对刚果的“不容争辩的权利”。他还硬说，比利时对刚果的
  “引导者和顾问的任务必须继续下去”。
