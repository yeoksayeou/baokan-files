New Tools for Ditching and Fertilizing
    According to Zhejiang Daily, the people's communes in Yin County, Zhejiang Province, while vigorously developing the cultivation and management of spring flowers, are paying attention to tool reform. The Gulin, Yinjiang, and Qiu'ai people's communes alone have reformed and created 201 spring flower field pit-digging and fertilizing tools. Using these tools for production can generally increase work efficiency by tenfold to fifteenfold.

    The Yin County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has attached importance to reforming tools and improving labor efficiency since the beginning of winter production. In the vigorous development of spring flower cultivation and management, a variety of tools have been reformed and created, including ox-drawn pit-digging machines, rope-pulled pit-digging machines, human-pushed fertilizer applicators, and human-pushed ash applicators. These new tools are generally trial-produced based on mechanical principles. Their common characteristics are: simple manufacture, labor-saving and material-saving, easy operation, high efficiency, fast speed, and good quality. For example, the ox-drawn pit-digging machines trial-produced by the Gulin and Yinjiang people's communes, after separate trial use, found that when opening deep ditches in green manure fields, they can dig more than three inches deep in one pass. According to different soil depth conditions, re-digging two to three times can reach the standard of eight inches to one foot two inches deep. Using a pit-digging machine, one person and one ox can dig deep ditches on 100 to 140 mu per day, which is ten to fifteen times higher than digging deep ditches with a shovel by hand, which can only dig seven to eight mu per day.

    The newly reformed and created agricultural tools are very popular among the local commune members. The members of the Gulin and Yinjiang people's communes happily call the ox-drawn pit-digging machines made by their agricultural machinery factories "jet-style rapid pit-digging machines" and "tractor-style pit-digging machines." Now, all communes have begun to promote and use these tools in the cultivation of spring flowers. After the Gulin People's Commune held a demonstration site meeting, the entire commune quickly manufactured and promoted 170 ox-drawn pit-digging machines.

Wooden Roller Can Suppress Excessive Wheat Seedling Growth
    According to Guizhou Daily, the Youth League members of the Dalan Brigade of the Yaxi Basic Commune in Zunyi City, Guizhou, who manage the Communist Youth League's bumper harvest dam, have created a wooden roller machine to suppress wheat seedlings and prevent excessive growth. The wheat seedlings that have been suppressed are growing vigorously and are a lush green.

    The wheat in this bumper harvest dam has tall seedlings that are more than five inches high, and shallow ones that are about three inches. Due to the many sunny days and mild climate this winter, coupled with sufficient fertilizer, the wheat seedlings are only growing upwards, but are not strong. In order to prevent excessive growth of the wheat seedlings, the Communist Youth League members used the original roller harrow, removed the toothed roller, and replaced it with a wooden stick about one foot long to create a wooden roller machine. Then, by pulling the wooden roller machine with a rope, the wheat seedlings can be suppressed. The benefits of using it to suppress wheat seedlings are: the suppressed wheat seedlings no longer grow upwards rapidly, the seedlings' fibrous roots increase, and they grow strong; the large clumps of mud in the wheat field are also crushed.

Wheat Fast Topdressing Applicator
    Xinhua News Agency reported: The Cangshan, Guanxian, and Huimin County people's communes in Shandong Province have created some fast topdressing applicators in wheat topdressing work. The double-wheeled topdressing cart created by the Moshan People's Commune in Cangshan County has four leaking cylinders at the back. One person pulls the cart, and six people carry water, mix manure, etc., and can topdress 15 mu per day. Dai Chunfu and Kong Linghuan of the Xiji People's Commune in Guanxian County successfully created three types of three-legged, five-legged, and eight-legged three-purpose (topdressing dilute manure, topdressing chemical fertilizer, topdressing dry manure) and three-operation (ditching, topdressing, and soil covering) fast topdressing drills. After testing and identification, the effect is good. The three-legged drill is operated by four people and can topdress 40 mu per day; the five-legged drill is operated by six people and can topdress 60 mu per day; the eight-legged drill is operated by eight people and can topdress 90 mu per day. The method of making the topdressing drill is: first make a small ox cart-like frame, install a wheel in the front center, and two wheels in the back, and install drill legs in the middle; each drill leg is equipped with a small iron drill shovel at the tip to pick up soil, and a wooden bucket that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom is installed at the rear top of the drill leg, and a round iron cylinder for leaking fertilizer is installed under the wooden bucket; a soil ridge that is wide at the front and narrow at the rear is installed behind the iron cylinder and below the wooden bucket to ridge the soil and cover the fertilizer. For easy control, two drill levers are installed in the front, and iron rods with screws are installed on the drill legs on both sides of the frame to adjust the depth.

    管理麦田新工具
    开沟施肥新工具
    据浙江日报消息浙江鄞县各人民公社在大抓春花培育管理工作中，注意工具改革。仅古林、鄞江、丘隘三个人民公社就改革和创造了春花田铲坑、施肥工具二百零一部，使用这些工具进行生产，工效一般可以提高十倍到十五倍。
    中共鄞县县委在冬季生产中一开始就重视了改革工具，提高劳动效率。在大抓春花培育管理中，已经改革和创造的有牛拉铲坑机、绳索牵引铲坑机、人推浇肥器、人推壅灰机等多种。这些新式工具一般都是根据机械原理试制而成的，它们的共同特点是：制造简单，省工省料，便于操作，效率高，速度快，质量好。如古林和鄞江人民公社试制的牛拉铲坑机，分别试用结果：绿肥田开深沟，一次能铲深三寸以上，根据土隔深浅的不同条件，分别复铲二到三次，就能达到八寸到一尺二寸深的标准。用铲坑机，一人、一牛，每天能铲深沟一百到一百四十亩，比人力用铁铲掘深沟每天掘七到八亩提高十到十五倍。
    经过改革和新创造出来的新式农具，很受当地社员群众的欢迎。古林和鄞江人民公社的社员们高兴地称呼自己的农具厂造出来的牛拉铲坑机为“喷气式快速铲坑机”和“拖拉机式铲坑机”。现在各公社都已开始在培育春花工作中推广和使用这些工具。古林人民公社通过示范现场会议后，全社很快就制造和推广了一百七十部牛拉铲坑机。
    木滚机能镇压麦苗疯长
    据贵州日报消息　贵州遵义市鸭溪基层公社大岚大队管理共青团丰产坝的团员们，创造了一种木滚机，用来镇压麦苗，制止了麦苗疯长。经过镇压的麦苗，生长茂盛，一片碧绿。
    这个丰产坝的小麦，长得高的麦苗达五寸以上，浅的也有三寸左右。由于今冬晴天多，气候温和，加以肥料足，所以麦苗只往上长，但不粗壮。为了制止麦苗疯长，共青团员们就利用原来的滚筒耙，去掉有耙齿的滚筒，换上一根过心一尺左右的木棒，制成木滚机。然后用绳子拉动木滚机，就能镇压麦苗。用它镇压麦苗的好处是：压过的麦苗，不再向上猛长，麦苗须根增多，长得粗壮；麦田里的大块泥巴，也被压碎了。
    小麦快速追肥器
    据新华社讯　山东省苍山、冠县和惠民县人民公社在小麦追肥工作中，创造一些快速追肥器，苍山县磨山人民公社创造的双轮追肥车，后边有四个漏筒，一个人拉车，六个人担水、拌粪等每天能追肥十五亩。冠县辛集人民公社戴春福、孔令环创造成功的三腿、五腿、八腿三种三用（追稀粪、追化肥、追粪干）、三作（挑沟、追肥、封土）快速追肥耧。经试验鉴定，效果良好。三腿耧由四人操作，每天能追肥四十亩；五腿耧由六人操作，每天能追肥六十亩；八腿耧由八人操作，每天能追肥九十亩。追肥耧的作法是：先造一个小牛车样的车框子，前面正中安一轮，后边安两轮，中间安耧腿；耧腿的尖端各安一个铁制小耧铧用来挑土，耧腿的后上方安一个上宽下窄的木斗子，木斗子下面安一个漏肥的圆铁筒；铁筒后边、木斗的后下方，安一个前宽后窄的土垄子用来垄土盖肥。为了便于掌握，前边安两根耧杆，靠框子两边的耧腿上各安一个带螺丝的铁棍，调剂深浅。
