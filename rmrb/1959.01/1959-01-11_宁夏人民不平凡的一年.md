The Extraordinary Year of the Ningxia People
Li Jinglin, Secretary of the CPC Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee

    1958 was a particularly extraordinary year for the people of Ningxia. In that year, the autonomous region achieved a great agricultural harvest, with grain output doubling that of 1957. A ten-thousand-strong iron and steel army went up the mountains to work hard throughout the autumn and winter, completing the steel production task. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, running through the region, opened to traffic four months ahead of schedule. Politically, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was established, and the rural areas fully realized the people's commune system. The victory on the ideological front was particularly significant. The political consciousness of the broad masses of people was greatly enhanced, and they demonstrated unprecedented enthusiasm, writing page after page of new poems in this "poorer and blanker" region.

    Following the victorious conclusion of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, a high tide of industrial and agricultural production was quickly launched throughout the region. At the same time, a high tide of nationwide cultural learning and school establishment also emerged. Many counties and cities have basically eliminated illiteracy, and primary school education has been popularized in all nineteen counties and cities of the region. Many farmers' middle schools and spare-time political, cultural, and technical schools have also been established. In particular, the broad masses of Hui people have greatly liberated their minds and productive forces in the movement against bad elements and bad deeds in religious circles and the abolition of feudal exploitation and oppression. The liberation of Hui women, who suffered the most severe oppression, is particularly prominent.

    In these tasks, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's repeated instructions to look at problems from multiple angles, grasp the main contradictions and the main aspects of contradictions, give full play to human subjective initiative, transform negative factors into positive factors, and turn bad things into good things were resolutely implemented. The people of Ningxia once again fully demonstrated this truth in the ideological leap forward of 1958. The people's pursuit of progress and the productive forces' pursuit of development are the main aspects of the main contradiction in society. All negative, hindering, and reactionary thoughts and actions will be defeated by the newborn and progressive forces. The appearance of a saddle-shaped curve in Ningxia's various constructions in 1957 was a bad thing, but after reviewing the experiences and lessons, the people, under the leadership of the Party, accepted this lesson, which then launched the great transformation and great leap forward of 1958, and it became a good thing.

    Over the past year, Hui women have achieved great accomplishments in industrial and agricultural production. They not only participated in general agricultural production, but also created many unexpected miracles in water conservancy projects, deep plowing, and especially in going up the mountains to smelt iron, steel, and copper. Although winter arrived, the mountains were cold and frozen, and the leadership repeatedly advised them to go down the mountains first, they still resolutely refused to do so. They competed with men, and also sewed and mended clothes and shoes for the male workers on the construction sites. In some places, women automatically donated shoes and socks to send to the soldiers smelting iron on the mountains in order to support them. Many women gave full play to the spirit of hard work and ingenuity when smelting iron and steel. They worked by the furnaces and lived by the furnaces, becoming an important force on the iron and steel front.

    Although the various tasks in the Great Leap Forward were so intense, pleasant songs could often be heard resounding throughout the mountains and fields. The masses of people created many moving poems and lively paintings in labor production. These pleasant songs, colorful poems and paintings fully expressed the feelings of the masses of people in the Great Leap Forward. They intertwined their creative labor, simple poems, and happy future, which is a magnificent poem created by the whole people.

    After the people's commune system, if some seeds of communism appeared in production and distribution, it is especially important to see the preciousness of these communist factors in people's thinking. The selfless working attitude of doing more work and not fearing hardship, the cooperative spirit of unity, mutual assistance and friendship, the lively and cheerful mood of optimism, all these are the style of communism, are invaluable treasures for accelerating the construction of socialism, and by fully developing this style, we will surely be able to achieve even greater victories.

    宁夏人民不平凡的一年
    中共宁夏回族自治区工委书记　李景林
    1958年对宁夏人民说来，是特别不平凡的一年。这一年，自治区在经济方面获得了农业大丰收，粮食产量比1957年翻了一番；十万钢铁大军上山，大干一秋冬，完成了钢铁生产任务；纵贯本区的包兰铁路，提前四个月通车。在政治上，成立了宁夏回族自治区，农村中全部实现了人民公社化。在思想战线上的胜利尤其显著，广大人民的政治觉悟都有极大提高，发挥了空前未有的干劲，在这“更穷更白”的地区，写下了一页又一页的新诗篇。
    整风和反右派斗争胜利结束后，全区迅速掀起了工农业生产的高潮。同时，也掀起了全民学文化、办学校的高潮。有好些县市已经基本上扫除了文盲，全区十九个县市都已普及了小学教育，还办了许多农民中学和业余政治文化技术学校。特别是广大回族人民在反对宗教界的坏人坏事、废除封建剥削和压迫的运动中，大大地解放了思想和生产力。受压迫最严重的回族妇女的解放更为突出。
    在这些工作中，坚决地执行了党中央和毛主席屡次指示我们要多方面的看问题，要抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，充分发挥人的主观能动性，变消极因素为积极因素，变坏事为好事的辩证方法。宁夏人民在1958年的思想跃进中，又一次充分地证明了这一真理。人民求进步，生产力求发展，这是社会主要矛盾的主要方面。一切消极、促退和反动的思想行动，都是要被新生的和进步的力量所战胜。1957年宁夏各项建设出现了马鞍形，这是坏事，但在检讨经验教训以后，人民在党的领导下，接受了这一教训，就掀起了1958年的大转变和大跃进，就变成了好事。
    一年来，回族妇女在工农业生产上取得了很大成就，她们不但参加了一般的农业生产，而且在水利工程上，深翻土地时，特别在上山炼铁、炼钢、炼铜中，创造了很多出人意料的奇迹。虽然冬天到来，上山天寒地冻，领导上再三劝说要她们先下山，但她们仍然坚决不肯下山。她们和男人进行竞赛，在工地上还替男工们缝补衣服和鞋袜。有些地方的妇女为了支援上山炼铁的战士，自动捐募鞋袜送上山。不少妇女在炼钢铁时充分发挥苦干巧干的精神。她们劳动在炉边，生活在炉边，成为钢铁战线上的一支重要力量。
    大跃进中的各项工作，虽然是那样的紧张，但经常可以听到愉快的歌声响遍山野。人民群众在劳动生产中创作了许多动人的诗和活泼的画。这种愉快的歌声，丰富多彩的诗和画，充分表达了人民群众在大跃进中的感情。他们把自己创造性的劳动，纯朴的诗歌和幸福的前途交织在一起，这是一首全民创作的瑰丽的诗篇。
    人民公社化以后，如果说在生产分配上出现了某些共产主义的萌芽的话，更应该特别看到人们思想上的这些共产主义因素的可贵。多做工作，不畏艰苦的忘我劳动态度，团结互助友爱的协作精神，生动活泼心情舒畅的乐观情绪，所有这些都是共产主义的风格，是加速建设社会主义的无价之宝，充分发扬这种风格，我们一定能够获得更伟大的胜利。
