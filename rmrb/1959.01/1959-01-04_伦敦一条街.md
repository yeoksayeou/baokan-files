Title: A Street in London

	On Regent Street—a main thoroughfare in central London—and in its front and back streets, you can see typical "Western civilization."

	On this street, various festive decorations and lanterns are put up every year around Christmas and New Year's Eve. In the brightly lit shop windows, Santa Claus, turning back and forth, drives a sleigh pulled by reindeer, loaded with all kinds of gifts that are incredibly expensive and meant to please the wealthy: diamonds and pearls, French perfumes, South American cigars, and imported brand-name wines. But ordinary people can't afford these things. At most, they just look at the windows from the doorway.

	On the sidewalk, I saw a young girl with purple-dyed hair and blue-dyed eyelids, holding a snow-white poodle wearing a bright red vest. She had just come from the dog grooming salon. Grooming such a poodle costs more than three pounds—more than about one-third of the weekly living expenses of a British pensioner.

	But right in front of the large department store, I also saw disabled veterans begging. They sat in chairs fitted with wheels, playing the violin, their battered hats upturned on the sidewalk to ask for money.

	On the street corner, an old beggar painter sat silently behind his hat, using colored chalk to draw touching landscapes and animals on the sidewalk, but his clothes were as tattered as a pile of rags.

	A few steps away, a bearded hunchbacked old man was playing the tune of "God Loves the World" on an old piano, his hat placed on top of the piano, containing only a few pennies. Here, seven pence can only buy a small loaf of bread.

	I also met John Myers, a London dockworker, in front of a large department store on Regent Street. He had not found work for four weeks. He explained, "But I'm not considered unemployed yet, so I'm not eligible for unemployment benefits."

	Currently, there are more than ten thousand registered unemployed dockworkers in Britain. There are more than seven thousand dockworkers like John who can't find work for weeks but aren't considered unemployed. They have to go to the docks twice a day, sign their names, and look for work. Even if there is no work, they have to wait there. Those who have been to the docks for six days and have not been able to find work can receive a subsidy of six pounds and one shilling from the dock authorities. If they don't wait there every day, they won't receive a penny. If they find work for one or two days, they have to deduct the wages earned from those one or two days from the six pounds and one shilling. In addition to using this allowance to pay for food, rent, and transportation, etc., he also has to pay eight shillings a week for national health insurance.

	To prepare for the heavy work of a dockworker, John must eat a lot before going to the docks to look for work. But he never finds work. He said with a wry smile, "If only I could foresee the future. On days when I can't find work, I would only eat two slices of bread and a cup of tea. That's enough for me to survive, and it would save a big meal."

	I told him that in many communes in China, meals are free, and his eyes immediately lit up.

	John is just one of the million workers who lost their jobs last year. Many of them said that, as far as they could remember, Christmas 1958 was the worst Christmas.

	Bus conductress Toss Gorringe told me that in recent months, not only have those who lost their jobs suffered, but some workers who have jobs have also seen their incomes reduced. Many workers used to be able to get overtime pay and extra wages for weekend work. But now they can only work five days a week, or less than eight hours a day.

	British Prime Minister Macmillan once said, when talking about living standards, "The British people have never had it so good." Among British workers, this has become a joke. Machine manufacturing worker Dave Baker said that compared to pre-war levels, the real wages of British workers today have fallen by a third.

	The southern end of Regent Street, where it meets Piccadilly Circus, is a famous nightlife center in London. Here, the lights shine as bright as day, cars and people flow endlessly, and the neon-lit American "Coca-Cola" advertisement is particularly glaring.

	In this small area around Piccadilly Circus, there are hundreds of restaurants, hotels, bars, cafes, theaters, and cinemas for the wealthy to have fun. Most of London's three thousand four hundred "clubs" are also in this area. But this is also a center of sin. American pornographic films, striptease and other "arts" emit poison here, corroding the minds of people, especially young people. And in the smoky, wine-smelling, and cheap-perfume-reeking, filthy basements, hooligans, drug dealers, pimps, and female traffickers, male and female layabouts, are drinking heavily, gambling, and dancing the "jitterbug." Girls from the countryside and foreign countries are lured to these places, where they live the lives of the insulted and injured.

	When you turn from the brightly lit Regent Street into the narrow and dark Regent Street back streets, you immediately feel like you have arrived in another world. Here, women in bizarre costumes stand in a row, one after another, quietly soliciting "business." This is London's prostitute line. Their soliciting has caused the government to express some concern.

	No one can say for sure how many prostitutes there are in London. In just one district in West London, the police encountered more than eight hundred prostitutes in a week, who "received customers" more than seven thousand times a week.

	When the damp and cold winter night descends, on this street, I also saw a group of people wearing thin pajamas or just shorts dancing in strange steps, attracting pedestrians. But when it came time to collect money, most of the audience scattered.

	The above is a portrait of the "civilized" Western way of life.

    伦敦一条街
    新华社记者  钱行
    在里金特街——伦敦中部的干道——的前街和后街，你可以看到典型的“西方文明”。
    在这条街上，在每年圣诞节和新年除夕前后都要装上各种各样的节日装饰品和灯笼。在灯火辉煌的橱窗里，来回转动着的圣诞老人，赶着驯鹿拉的雪橇，上面装着各种各样价格高昂得惊人的供阔人们开心的礼物：钻石和珍珠、法国香水、南美的雪茄和进口的名酒。但是，普通人都买不起这些东西。他们顶多在门口看看橱窗罢了。
    在人行道上我看到了一个头发染成紫色、眼皮染成蓝色的年轻姑娘，她手里牵着一只穿鲜红背心的雪白的狮子狗。她刚从狗的美容院里出来。给这种狮子狗剪一次毛要花三镑多——比英国一个领养老金的人一周的生活费还要多大约三分之一。
    但是，就在大百货公司前面，我也看到了行乞的残废军人。他们坐在装上车轮的椅子上，拉着小提琴，破帽子朝天放在人行道上向人要钱。
    在街角上，一个行乞的年老的画家沉默地坐在他的帽子后面，他用彩色粉笔在人行道上画着动人的风景和动物，但是，他的衣服却褴褛得像一堆破布。
    几步路以外，一个长着胡子的驼背老头正在旧钢琴上弹奏着“上帝爱世人”的调子，他的帽子放在钢琴上面，里面只有很少几个便士。在这里，七便士才能买到一个小面包。
    我在里金特街的一家大百货公司的前面还遇见了约翰·迈耳斯，他是伦敦的一个码头工人。他已经四个星期没有找到工作了。他解释说：“但是我还不算是失业，我没有资格领失业救济金。”
    目前英国有一万多名登记了的失业码头工人。像约翰这样几星期找不到工作但是还不算是失业的码头工人，就有七千多。他们得一天去码头两次，签上自己的名字，找工作。即使没有工作，他们也得在那里等着。已经到码头去过六天而不能找到工作的人可以从码头当局那里领到六英镑一先令的津贴。如果他们不天天去那里等着，他们就一个钱也领不到。如果他们找到了一两天的工作，他们就得从六英镑一先令中扣除这一两天所得的工资。他除了用这笔津贴付伙食费、房租和车钱等等以外，每星期还得付八先令的全国健康保险费。
    为了准备做码头工人的重活，约翰在去码头找工作以前必须吃很多东西。但是，他总是找不到工作。他苦笑着说：“要是我能未卜先知那就好了。找不到工作那天，我就只吃两片面包和一杯茶。这就够我活下去了，也可以省一大顿饭。”
    我告诉他说，在中国许多公社中已经吃饭不要钱，他的眼睛顿时放出了光彩。
    约翰只是去年失业的一百万工人中间的一个。他们中间的许多人说，就他们的记忆所及，1958年的圣诞节是最坏的一个圣诞节。
    公共汽车女工托斯·戈林奇对我说，在最近几个月内，受苦的不仅是那些失去工作的工人，一些有工作的工人收入也减少了。许多工人原来能够得到加班费和周末工作的额外工资。但是，现在他们每星期只能工作五天，或者每天工作不足八小时。
    英国首相麦克米伦有一次在谈到生活水平时说，“英国人民的生活水平从来没有这么好过”。在英国工人中间，这已经成了笑话。机器制造工人戴夫·贝克说，同战前的水平相比，今天英国工人的实际工资已经下降了三分之一。
    里金特街南端和皮卡迪利广场相接处是伦敦有名的夜生活中心。这里灯光照耀得如同白昼，汽车和人群川流不息，用霓虹灯装璜的美国“可口可乐”广告特别刺眼。
    在皮卡迪利广场周围的这一小块地方有成百家饭馆、旅馆、酒吧、咖啡馆、剧院和电影院，供阔人们寻开心。伦敦的三千四百个“俱乐部”大多数也在这个地区。但是，这里也是罪恶的中心。美国黄色电影、脱衣舞等“艺术”在这里散发着毒气，腐蚀着人们特别是青少年的心灵。而在烟雾弥漫、酒味和劣质香水的气味熏人的污秽不堪的地下室里，流氓、贩毒者、老鸨和女人贩子、男女阿飞等，正在酗酒、聚赌、跳“摇摆舞”。从乡下和外国来的姑娘被引诱到这些地方来，在这里过着被侮辱和被损害者的生活。
    当你从照耀得如同白昼的里金特大街拐弯转入狭窄而黑暗的里金特后街的时候，你马上就好像到了另一个世界。在这里，装束古怪的女人们，一个接着一个地排在那里，安安静静地兜揽着“生意”。这是伦敦的妓女队伍。她们拉客的情况使得政府也不得不表示某些忧虑。
    谁也说不清伦敦究竟一共有多少妓女。仅仅在伦敦西部的一个区，警察在一周中就遇见了八百多个妓女，她们每星期“接客”七千多次。
    当潮湿而寒冷的冬夜降临的时候，在这条街上，我还看到了穿着薄睡裤或者只穿着短裤的一群人用稀奇古怪的步伐跳起舞来，吸引着行人。可是在收钱的时候，大多数观众就一哄而散了。
    上面种种就是“文明”的西方生活方式的写照。
