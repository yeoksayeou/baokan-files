    The family committee's office was packed with people, as lively as preparing for a wedding. After each committee member reported on their work, the director assigned the current tasks of making steel, running factories, loading and unloading vehicles, running canteens, and nurseries. Everyone accepted the tasks with smiling faces, saying: the more tasks, the more energy! Finally, the director asked if there were any comments. What other comments could there be? Everyone seemed eager to go back and start working, fully loaded. Suddenly, a loud, sharp voice came from the corner: "I have a comment." Everyone turned to look; it was Shen Peilan. She looked like she was holding back a lot of anger. The director paused and asked, "What's your comment? Say it!"

    "I want to resign." The sentence was as decisive as chopping nails and cutting iron, without any ambiguity.

    Everyone was stunned, and the bustling room suddenly quieted down. The director wondered, what exactly made Shen Peilan so angry? Quick-tongued Aunt Zhang was about to say that she had the nerve to say that, resigning during the Great Leap Forward! Aren't you afraid your daughter will be ashamed of you? But before she could speak, Shen Peilan spoke like a river bursting its banks,滔滔滔滔地说道：: "In the Great Leap Forward, every one of you committee members is hot and bothered, only my mediation committee is cold and quiet. Even Zhou Guizhen, who used to wear out the threshold of my house, doesn't come anymore. In the past, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law would sit idle at home, staring at each other, and even look for things to quarrel about if there was nothing to do. Now, one participates in labor, and the other takes care of children. They all say, 'Sister-in-law, arguing now doesn't look like the Great Leap Forward at all. You, the mediation committee member, should resign quickly.' You were elected by everyone, and so was I. Why should you be bustling and I be cold and quiet? Every day, it's just busy here, helping a bit; needed there, doing a bit. What exactly is my committee doing? How can I explain it to everyone?" After speaking, she sat down forcefully in anger, and then immediately stood up again, saying, "I demand to be assigned other work."

    As soon as the words fell, the room suddenly erupted in a noisy discussion: "Ah, so that's the reason, no wonder she's so angry." "Yes! Director, you really are a bit bureaucratic." "We can't only blame the director, we also didn't care enough about our comrade." "I propose that the mediation committee be abolished." "I propose that the mediation committee be changed to a dispatch committee. Don't we have dispatchers in our railway system? Now, organizing everyone to participate in various labor activities also requires good dispatching." "That's right, bad dispatching can also cause disagreements. Yesterday, when we went to unload the trucks, those who arrived first did all the 'marshal' goods, and those who arrived later did the light work, so there were a lot of opinions. This requires both dispatching and mediation." "That's right!" Several people shouted in agreement at the same time. This enthusiasm almost blew the roof off.

    调解委员要辞职
    胡涵
    家属委员会的办公室里挤满了人，就像筹办喜事的闹哄哄。各个委员汇报了自己的工作后，主任委员把当前搞钢铁、办工厂、装卸车、办食堂和托儿所的工作布置了一下，大家接受任务都笑盈盈的说：任务越多劲儿越大。最后，主任委员问了一下有什么意见；这还有啥意见呢？大家就像满载而归的急于回去动手干了。突然，从墙角发出了一声响亮的尖嗓音：“我有意见。”大家转头一看，原来是沈佩兰。看样子，她真憋着好大的气哩。主任委员顿了一下问道：“有啥意见说吧！”
    “我要辞职。”这句话说得像斩钉截铁，毫不含糊。
    这下，大家都呆住了，闹哄哄的屋里顿时静了下来。主任委员在奇怪的猜想：到底什么事使沈佩兰生这么大气。快嘴张大妈正想开口说她好意思说得出口，大跃进里闹辞职！不怕你女儿羞你。但还未出口，沈佩兰就像决了口的河堤滔滔地说道：“大跃进，你们哪个委员都是热哄哄，只有我这个调解委员冷清清。连往常要踏破我家门槛的周桂珍也不来了。往常婆媳都闲坐在家里，眼睛对鼻头，没事也会寻点事出来吵吵。现在一个参加劳动，一个看管小孩，都说哪里还有心思吵嘴，也没这闲功夫来吵嘴。看见我就说：‘大嫂，现在再吵嘴那还像个大跃进，你这个调解委员快去辞掉算了。’你们是大家选出来的，我也是大家选出来的，为什么你们就该闹哄哄，我就该冷清清。每天只是这里忙，帮一下；那里要，搞一下，我这个委员到底弄点啥名堂？叫我怎么向大家交代？”说罢，她赌气地使劲坐下，霍地马上又站起来说：“我要求另外分配工作。”
    话刚落地，屋里顿时又闹哄哄的议论开了：“啊呀，原来这样，难怪生这么大气。”“是啊！主任委员，你真有点官僚主义。”“不能光怪主任委员，我们也太不关心同志了。”“我提议，调解委员可以取消。”“我提议把调解委员改为调度委员。我们铁路里不是有调度员吗？现在组织大家参加各种劳动也要调度得好。”“对，调度不好也会闹意见。昨天去卸车，先到的把‘元帅’货都干了，后到的干轻活就意见一大堆，这就要靠又调度又调解了。”“对！”好几个人同时大声赞成。这股热哄劲儿简直把屋顶都要冲跑了。
