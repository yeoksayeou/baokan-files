Finite Turns Infinite
Wang Pu

Having doubled production last year, can we achieve another great leap forward this year? This is a question many enterprises are facing when discussing their plans for a bigger leap forward this year. After mass discussions, the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant gave a positive answer.

On the basis of existing equipment and manpower, how can the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant increase production by several times? What's the secret? Could it be that their equipment capacity is inherently infinite, as much as they want? Of course not. Under the condition that all conditions remain unchanged, the potential of any machinery and equipment has a certain limit. To deny that the capacity of machinery and equipment has a certain limit, thinking that there is as much as you want, is tantamount to denying the role of objective conditions in production, which is of course one-sided.

However, the limit can also be changed. When we say that machine capacity has a certain limit, it refers to the case where all conditions have not changed. And conditions are not unchangeable. When we reform a certain machine or change some operation methods, the conditions change, and the limit changes accordingly, and new production potential appears. Comrade Li Xingwang, a worker at the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant, improved the machine tool operation method and increased the machine's rotation speed per minute, which increased the efficiency of processing vertical lathe turbines by eleven times, which is an example. Due to the continuous development of science and technology, the continuous enrichment of human practical experience, and the continuous improvement of human understanding of objective things, there is much to be done in the reform of machines and the improvement of operations. Today's reform, tomorrow can be reformed again; tomorrow's reform, the day after tomorrow can be reformed again on a new basis. Each reform will increase the machine's production capacity under new conditions. Therefore, in this sense, production potential is infinite. To deny this, thinking that production has reached its peak and cannot be improved, is to deny the development of things, and therefore is not a dialectical materialist.

The transformation of equipment capacity from finite to infinite, and the transformation of production potential from finite to infinite, are the results of people's subjective initiative continuously acting on objective conditions and continuously changing objective conditions. Therefore, on the basis of the original equipment and manpower, whether production can make another great leap forward this year ultimately depends on whether the subjective initiative of people has been fully utilized. To give full play to people's subjective initiative, we must constantly boost our efforts, constantly liberate our minds, constantly study technology, correctly understand the laws of development of objective things, and actively transform objective things. That is to say, in order to realize the great leap forward plan for China's industrial development this year, we must combine hard work with smart work and actively carry out the technical reform movement. This is an important task at present. After doing this, the employees of the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant are full of confidence in completing a leap forward plan that is three times higher than in 1958. Their experience is worth learning from.

    有穷变无穷
    王朴
    去年产量翻了一番，今年能不能再大跃进？这是许多企业在讨论今年更大跃进计划时所面临的一个问题。山西机床厂经过群众性的大辩论以后，作了肯定的答复。
    山西机床厂在现有设备和人力的基础上，使产量再增长几倍，奥妙何在？莫非他们的设备能力天生就是无穷无尽的，要多大就有多大？当然不是。任何机器设备在一切条件都不改变的情况下，潜力的挖掘总是有一定限度的。不承认机器设备能力有一定限度，以为要多大就有多大，就无异否认客观条件在生产中的作用，当然是片面的。
    但是，限度也是可以改变的。我们说机器能力有一定限度，是指在一切条件没有改变的情况下讲的。而条件并不是不可改变的。当我们对某种机器进行一些改革，或者改变了一些操作方法以后，条件改变了，限度就跟着改变，新的生产潜力就出现了。山西机床厂工人李兴旺同志，改进了机床操作方法，提高机器每分钟转动速度，使加工立式车床涡轮的工效提高十一倍，就是一个例子。由于科学技术的不断发展，由于人的实践经验不断丰富，由于人对客观事物的认识不断完善，所以，对机器的改革，对操作的改进是大有文章可做的。今天改革了，明天还可以再改革；明天改革了，后天还可以在新的基础上再改革。每改革一次，机器的生产能力就在新的条件下提高一次。因此，从这个意义上说，生产潜力是无穷的。不承认这一点，以为生产到顶了，不能再提高了，就是不承认事物的发展，因而也就不是辩证唯物主义者。
    设备能力从有限到无限的转化，生产潜力从有穷到无穷的转化，是人的主观能动性不断作用于客观条件，不断改变客观条件的结果。所以，在原有设备和人力的基础上，今年的生产能不能再大跃进，归根结底在于是不是充分发挥了人的主观能动作用。而要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，我们就必须不断鼓足干劲，不断解放思想，不断钻研技术，正确认识客观事物的发展规律，积极改造客观事物。这就是说为了实现今年我国工业发展的大跃进计划，我们必须把苦干和巧干结合起来，积极开展技术改革运动。这是当前的一项重要工作。山西机床厂的职工们这样做以后，对于完成比1958年还高三倍的跃进计划，充满着百倍信心。他们的经验是值得学习的。
