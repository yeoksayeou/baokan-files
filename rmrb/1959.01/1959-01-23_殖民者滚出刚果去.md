    Colonizers Get Out of the Congo!
    To the Editor:
    The Congolese people, enslaved for eighty years, have finally erupted in earth-shaking roars. A blazing flame of struggle has ignited in the colonialists' "oasis of tranquility." These past few days, every time I've read the news and articles about the Congo, my heart has been stirred and unable to calm down for a long time.
    Africa belongs to the African people. The Congo belongs to the Congolese people. For over a hundred years, imperialists have relied on violence and deception to establish a bloody colonial rule in Africa, in the Congo. They have plundered profits worth billions, bringing the Congolese people staggering poverty, hunger, and death. The Congolese people have every right to achieve independence and autonomy immediately. The Belgian colonialists should get out of the Congo.
    Today is an era of colonial systems heading towards death and colonial peoples heading towards new life. With the support of the powerful socialist camp and world progressive forces, the national independence movement is an irresistible torrent. To those bloated colonial tycoons, we issue a serious warning: your good days are long gone. If you want to rely on the support of U.S. imperialism to cling to the colonial system, then the very place where you used to make your fortunes will one day become the grave that finally buries you!

### 殖民者滚出刚果去

    殖民者滚出刚果去编辑同志：
    被奴役了八十年的刚果人民终于发生了震天的吼声。殖民主义的“安定的绿洲”上燃起了熊熊的斗争火焰。这几天来，每当阅读了报上有关刚果的消息和文章之后，激动的心情总是久久不能平息下来。
    非洲是非洲人民的非洲。刚果是刚果人民的刚果。百余年来，帝国主义者依靠暴力和欺骗，在非洲、在刚果建立了血腥的殖民统治。它们掠夺了数以亿计的利润，带给刚果人民的却是惊人的贫困、饥饿和死亡。刚果人民完全有权利立即取得独立自主。比利时殖民主义者应该滚出刚果。
    今天是一个殖民制度走向死亡、殖民地人民走向新生的时代。在强大的社会主义阵营和世界进步力量支持下，民族独立运动是一股谁也阻挡不了的洪流。对于那些脑满肠肥的殖民大亨们，我们要提出严重的警告：你们的好日子早已过去了。要是你们想依靠美帝国主义的支持，死抱住殖民制度不放，那么，你们过去赖以发家致富的地方，终将有一天成为最后埋葬你们的坟墓！
