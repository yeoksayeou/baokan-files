Xinhua News Agency, January 24th dispatch from Léopoldville: Since the bloody massacre of the Congolese people by the Belgian colonial government in this Congolese capital on January 4th and 5th, the situation there has not calmed down despite the colonial authorities' intensified repression. The Belgian "Libre Belgique" newspaper, in a message from there published on the 22nd, stated that the city had suffered "fatal damage" in the recent conflicts and that it was "difficult to restore it to its original state." The situation there is still very tense.

The Belgian colonial government continues to persecute Congolese national movement leaders. The Léopoldville court on the 23rd insisted that the arrest of Kasavubu, chairman of the Congolese nationalist organization "Abako," and thirteen other committee members was "justified," and declared that they would continue to detain and interrogate them until they are brought to trial approximately two months later.

Since the Léopoldville incident, people in Kimunza, Kaasongulu, Thysville, Élisabethville and other places in the Congo, regardless of the colonial authorities' frenzied suppression, have launched struggles of resistance one after another. On the 16th, a demonstration against colonial rule broke out again in the Ngiri-Ngiri suburb of Léopoldville, and the Belgian colonial authorities' police once again opened fire. In Stanleyville, 1,200 kilometers east of Léopoldville, workers have held several strikes and clashed with the police, who arrested fifty local workers.

The events of January 4th in Léopoldville unfolded as follows: On that morning, a meeting was held to report on the Accra Conference, attended by several thousand people. At the meeting, the Congolese people expressed their hope that Belgians and Congolese would have equal status in an independent Congo. The masses shouted slogans such as "We want independence now" and "Belgians, go back to Europe."

At this time, the Belgian colonial authorities used the excuse that the meeting had not been approved and used violent means of suppression against the peaceful people. Troops were mobilized, and the police were ordered to take "offensive action." They used rifles with fixed bayonets, submachine guns, and heavy machine guns, and even deployed armored vehicles. Under these circumstances, the Congolese people were forced to take resistance actions.

In this bloody incident, the Belgian authorities officially announced that forty-two people were killed, and later local officials announced that it was seventy-one. According to unofficial sources, the death toll was one hundred and seventy-two (one said five hundred), and more than two hundred people were injured. All the dead were local Africans.

Under the cruel oppression and exploitation of colonialism, the Congolese people have never stopped their resistance struggles for more than a decade. Workers' struggles, peasant demonstrations, and popular uprisings have occurred many times. It is reported that in 1956 alone, as many as 209,000 people were arrested and imprisoned. For a long time, at nationalist gatherings in the Congo, people sang a song that began with: "Congo, the land of our ancestors, we will fight for your freedom, even if blood flows like a river." According to reports, this resistance action in Léopoldville is the climax of mass struggles in recent times and is also one of the larger-scale resistance actions in many years.

The Belgian colonial government is both using empty promises of allowing the Congo "independence" to paralyze the Congolese people's struggle and strengthening repression. However, although the colonial authorities may be able to control the situation with force, they cannot stop the rapid development of the Congolese national independence movement. The Moroccan weekly "Independence" said not long ago that the mayor of Léopoldville "can use force to delay the development of the Congolese liberation movement, but at the cost of incurring the hatred of the Congolese people and the failure of the Belgians."

### 民族独立的火焰在刚果蔓延  各地先后爆发反殖民镇压的斗争

    民族独立的火焰在刚果蔓延
    各地先后爆发反殖民镇压的斗争
    新华社24日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：自从1月4、5两日在这个刚果首都发生了比利时殖民政府血腥屠杀刚果人民的事件以来，尽管殖民当局一直在加紧镇压，但是那里的局势始终没有平静下来。比利时“自由比利时报”在22日刊载的来自那里的消息说，这个城市在最近发生的冲突中遭到了“致命的伤害”，而且“难于恢复它原来的生活”。那里的形势还很紧张。
    比利时殖民政府仍然坚持对刚果民族运动领袖进行迫害。利奥波德维尔法庭在23日硬说拘捕刚果民族主义组织“阿巴科”的主席卡萨武布和其他十三名委员的行动是“正当”的，并且声言还要继续拘留和侦讯他们，直到大约两个月以后再把他们提交法庭审判。
    自从利奥波德维尔事件发生以来，刚果的基穆恩扎、开山古鲁、太斯维尔、伊利沙伯维尔等地人民，不顾殖民当局的疯狂镇压，先后开展了反抗斗争。在16日，利奥波德维尔的恩吉里—恩吉里郊区又爆发过反对殖民统治的示威，比利时殖民当局的警察又一次开了枪。在利奥波德维尔以东一千二百公里的斯坦利维尔，工人举行过好几次罢工，并且同警察发生冲突，警察逮捕了五十名本地工人。
    1月4日在利奥波德维尔发生的事件的经过是这样的：当天早上，那里举行了一次有几千人参加的阿克拉会议传达报告会。会上，刚果人民表示希望比利时人和刚果人在一个独立的刚果中有着平等的地位。到会群众高呼：“我们现在就要独立”“比利时人滚回欧洲去”的口号。
    就在这时候，比利时殖民当局以会议没有得到批准为借口，对和平人民使用了暴力镇压手段。军队被调集来了，警察被命令采取“攻击行动”。他们使用上好刺刀的枪枝、手提机关枪和重机关枪，还出动了装甲车。在这种情况下，刚果人民被迫采取了反抗行动。
    在这次流血事件中，比利时官方宣布打死了四十二人，后来当地官方人士又宣布是七十一人。据非官方消息，死亡人数是一百七十二人（一说是五百人），受伤二百多人。死亡的都是当地的非洲人。
    在殖民主义者的残酷压迫和剥削下，近十多年来，刚果人民一直没有停止过他们的反抗斗争，工人斗争、农民示威和人民起义曾多次发生过。有消息说，仅仅在1956年一年内，被抓进监狱的就有二十万九千人之多。长期以来，在刚果的民族主义集会上，人们唱着一首歌，它的开头是：“刚果哟，我们祖先的国土，我们将为你的自由而斗争，即使血流成河也要斗争。”据报道，这次利奥波德维尔的反抗行动，是近时期来群众斗争的高潮，也是多年来反抗行动规模较大的一次。
    比利时殖民政府正在一方面用允许刚果“独立”的空洞诺言来麻痹刚果人民的斗争，一方面又在加强镇压。但是，殖民当局尽管有可能用强力把局势控制住，但是它无法阻止刚果民族独立运动的迅速发展。摩洛哥“独立”周刊不久前说，利奥波德维尔的市长先生“可以采取武力，推迟刚果解放运动的发展，但代价是招来刚果人民的仇恨和比利时人的失败”。
