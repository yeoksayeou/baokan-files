    Less Manual Labor, More Steel
    Thousands of Furnaces and Mines in Sichuan Rush to Build Transportation Networks
    Chengdu, January 15th (reporter Lü Xilin): More than a thousand small blast furnace groups and mining areas in Sichuan Province are making full use of the terrain and adapting to local conditions to vigorously develop "One Network, Four Transformations" (short-distance transportation networks for furnace groups and mining areas, with transportation becoming wooden rail-based, chute-based, cableway-based, and vehicle-based). They are striving to build steel transportation networks covering the entire province in the first quarter of this year, ensuring the continued high-speed development of steel production.
    Sichuan Province's "One Network, Four Transformations" movement began in November last year. According to the plans of furnace groups and mining areas in various places, before the first quarter of this year, the province can build 10,000 kilometers of wooden rails, 2,000 kilometers of chutes, and 3,000 kilometers of aerial cableways. In the short 40 days at the end of last year, various places had already built more than 6,000 kilometers of various transportation lines such as wooden rails, chutes, and aerial cableways, and manufactured 80,000 vehicles. Hundreds of furnace groups and mining areas have all realized "One Network, Four Transformations." Railways, highways, inland rivers and other trunk and branch lines are connected, "forming a large steel transportation network covering the entire province, consisting of smaller transportation networks nested within it." The province's output of native iron ore increased significantly in December, and the amount transported out increased by 11% compared to November, but the labor force on the transportation front was reduced by more than 300,000 people.
    The blast furnace groups in various parts of Sichuan are generally built in mountainous areas rich in mineral deposits, where transportation is very inconvenient. Short-distance collection and transportation between furnace groups and mining areas is the weakest link. Although about 2.5 million of the 6 million steel army are specifically engaged in transportation, it still cannot meet the needs of production and pig iron export. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China foresaw that the short-distance collection and transportation problem is an important key to affecting the continued high-speed development of the steel front this year. In November last year, it instructed various places to grasp transportation work and transportation construction while grasping steel production. It is necessary to grasp both long-distance trunk lines and short-distance transportation, make full use of the mountainous terrain, adapt to local conditions, and focus on wooden rails, chutes, and aerial cableways to vigorously carry out the mass movement of "One Network, Four Transformations." The Provincial Party Committee required all localities to drive the entire transportation front by solving the two central links of steel transportation and short-distance transportation construction for furnace groups and mining areas, increasing transportation volume by several times, and saving 1 million to 1.5 million people from the transportation personnel.
    From November 16th to 19th last year, the province held an on-site meeting on "One Network, Four Transformations" in the Guanwushan Mining Area of Jiangzhang County, criticizing some people's ideas that to engage in transportation construction, one should build highways, buy cars, and build iron rails, as well as being satisfied with the status quo of carrying on shoulders and backs. Local Party committees, city committees, and county committees adopted the method of using points to lead the way and spreading out after piloting, mobilizing the masses to quickly set off a construction upsurge of "One Network, Four Transformations." The furnace groups and mining areas in Jiangbei County are all built in mountainous and hilly areas, and the distance between furnace groups, mines, and coal mines is generally five or six miles. The furnace groups in the county have to transport two to three thousand tons of ore, fuel, and pig iron every day. One person can only transport three to four hundred catties a day, which consumes a lot of manpower, the labor intensity of workers is very high, and the blast furnaces often suffer from "grain shortages." In December, the county extracted some steel production personnel to specialize in road repairs, and implemented a combination of special road repairs and vehicle manufacturing with full-scale assaults. Wooden rails were built in flat areas, chutes were built on hillsides, and cableways were erected on cliffs. In half a month, a total of 589 wooden rails were built, with a length of 502 kilometers. More than 200 chutes, aerial cableways, simple highways, cart roads, and earthen cart roads were built, realizing "One Network, Four Transformations" in the entire county. Various lines are interlocked, and comprehensive transportation using various tools is implemented, with an average transport efficiency increased by more than ten times. In the past, more than half of the 70,000-strong steel army in this county were often responsible for transportation tasks, but now it has been reduced to 7,000 people. Pig iron production has greatly increased, and the task of exporting pig iron in December was overfulfilled six days ahead of schedule.
    All furnace groups and mining areas in the province build "One Network, Four Transformations" by using local materials, using local bamboo and wood materials to build roads and manufacture vehicles, spending very little money and achieving quick results. The Guanwushan Mining Area in Jiangzhang County is located in a primeval forest area more than 2,000 meters above sea level. The mining area's sheep trails were opened up by the miners. Producing 4,000 tons of ore per day and transporting it from the mountain to the Wudu furnace group required 35,000 people for transportation. In November last year, all the mine workers fought hard for seven days and spent only more than 300 yuan to build the mining area's transportation network. The number of transportation personnel was reduced by more than 95%, and the labor intensity was greatly reduced.
    At present, Sichuan Province's short-distance transportation network is rapidly expanding. Except for a few small blast furnaces that have not been fixed, more than 80% of the remaining furnace groups and mining areas have begun construction. Various localities also plan to gradually carry out technical transformation of "One Network, Four Transformations" when conditions are available in the future, replacing manpower with mechanical power, turning "small earthen groups" into "small foreign groups," and further improving transportation efficiency.

### 少用人力　多炼钢铁  四川千余炉群、矿区赶建运输网

    少用人力　多炼钢铁
    四川千余炉群、矿区赶建运输网
    本报成都15日电　记者吕希林报道：四川省一千多个小高炉群和矿区充分利用地形特点，因地制宜地大搞“一网四化”（炉群和矿区的短途交通网，运输木轨化、梭槽化、索道化、车子化），争取今年第一季度内建成遍布全省的钢铁运输网，保证钢铁生产继续高速度发展。
    四川省的“一网四化”运动从去年11月份展开。根据各地炉群和矿区的规划，今年第一季度以前，全省可以建成木轨道一万公里，梭槽二千公里，架空索道三千公里。去年年底的短短四十天中，各地已经建成木轨道、梭槽、架空索道等各种运输线路共六千多公里，造车八万辆。上百个炉群、矿区全部实现了“一网四化”。铁路，公路、内河等干线和支线相连，“全省范围内一个大运输网套小运输网的钢铁运输网正在形成。12月份全省土铁产量大大增加，外运量比11月份增长了11％，但是运输战线上却减少了三十万人以上的劳动力。
    四川各地的高炉群一般都建设在矿藏丰富的山区，交通很不方便。炉群和矿区之间的短途集运又是最薄弱的环节。虽然六百多万钢铁大军中约有二百五十万人专门搞运输，但还满足不了生产和生铁外运的需要。中共四川省委预见到短途集运问题是影响今年钢铁战线继续高速度发展的重要关键，在去年11月间指示各地，在抓钢铁生产的同时，要抓紧运输工作和交通建设，既抓长途干线，又抓短途运输，充分利用山区地形，因地制宜，以木轨道、梭槽、架空索道为主，大搞“一网四化”的群众运动。省委要求各地通过解决钢铁运输和炉群、矿区短途交通建设这两个中心环节，把整个交通运输战线带动起来，使运量提高几倍，并从运输人员中节省出一百万人到一百五十万人。
    去年11月16日到19日，全省在江彰县观雾山矿区召开了“一网四化”现场会议，批判了有些人认为要搞交通建设就修公路、买汽车、搞铁轨道，以及满足于肩挑背运的现状等思想。各地委、市委、县委采取以点带面，先试点后铺开的方法，发动群众迅速掀起了一个“一网四化”建设高潮。江北县的炉群、矿区全部建在山区和丘陵地带，炉群、矿井、煤井间的距离一般都有五、六华里。全县炉群每天要运两三千吨矿石、燃料和生铁，一个人一天只能运三、四百斤，耗用的人力很多，工人劳动强度很大，高炉还经常闹“粮荒”。12月份，县里抽出一部分钢铁生产人员专门修路，实行专人修路造车与全面突击相结合，在平缓地区大修木轨道，陵坡修梭槽，悬岩架索道，半个月时间共建成木轨道五百八十九条，长达五百零二公里，修起梭槽、架空索道、简易公路、架车路、土车路二百多条，在全县实现了“一网四化”。各种线路一环扣一环，实行多种工具综合运输，平均运效提高十倍以上。过去这个县七万名钢铁大军中经常有一半以上的人担负运输任务，现在已减少到七千人。生铁产量大大增加，12月份还提前六天超额完成了生铁外运任务。
    全省所有炉群、矿区建设“一网四化”都是就地取材，利用当地竹木材料修路造车，花钱很少，收效又快。江彰县观雾山矿区是在海拔二千公尺以上的原始森林区，矿区的羊肠小道还是开矿工人走出来的。每天生产四千吨矿石从山上运到武都炉群，要三万五千人搞运输。去年11月份，全矿工人奋战七天，只花了三百多元钱，就建成了矿区运输网，运输人员减少了95％以上，劳动强度也大大减轻。
    目前四川省短途运输网正在迅速伸展。除了少数没有定点的小高炉外，其余80％以上的炉群、矿区都已开始施工。各地还计划在将来条件具备时，逐步进行“一网四化”的技术改造，以机械动力代替人力，把“小土群”变为“小洋群”，进一步提高运输效率。
