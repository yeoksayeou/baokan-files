    Gasification City
    Arriving at the location of the Mahai Exploration Team headquarters in the Qaidam Basin, the first thing that catches people's attention is the Gasification City. Half a year ago, when the Mahai Exploration Team was drilling the Mazhong No. 1 well, they discovered a large amount of natural gas. The deeper they drilled, the more gas spewed out. Therefore, the workers put forward the slogan "Use natural gas in every aspect," installed gas pipelines and sent the natural gas to the team headquarters a mile away. Then, a well-developed gas pipeline network was quickly formed. From then on, the people here began a gasification life.

    The cooks and boiler workers were the first to become interested in natural gas. They introduced gas pipelines into the kitchen and boiler room, using natural gas to cook and boil water, which was both hygienic and convenient. Just by turning on the switch, they could continuously boil water and provide warmth day and night. Using natural gas to burn the boiler, three generators with a capacity of nearly 100 kilowatts roared to life, solving the problem of electricity for lighting and machinery. Car drivers store natural gas in the gas tank to replace diesel for driving cars, which can run for dozens of kilometers. After the Great Leap Forward in Steel, the team party committee put forward the call to use natural gas to make steel. At that time, some people asserted that it would not succeed, but under the leadership of the party committee secretary, on November 11, they finally used natural gas to directly smelt ore into steel.

    At present, natural gas has been fully utilized in production and life in the Mahai exploration area, and it has become a gasified world. (Yang Chungui Jin Mei)

    气化城
    来到柴达木盆地马海勘探大队队部所在地，首先引起人们注意的是这里的气化城。半年前，马海勘探大队在钻探马中一井的时候，发现有大量天然气，越往下钻探，喷气越多。于是工人们提出了“把天然气利用到一切方面去”的口号，安上输气管把天然气送到一里以外的大队部，接着一个四通八达的输气网很快地形成了。从此，这里的人们，开始了气化生活。
    炊事员和司炉工，最先对天然气发生兴趣，把输气管引进厨房、锅炉房，用天然气烧饭烧水，既卫生又方便，只要把开关一开，可以日夜不断地烧水送暖。用天然气烧锅炉，三部近一百瓩的发电机隆隆地响起来，解决了照明用电和机器用电。汽车司机把天然气储藏在汽箱里，代替柴油开汽车，能跑几十公里。大炼钢铁以后，大队党委提出了用天然气炼钢的号召，当时有人断定不会成功，但在党委书记的领导下，在11月11日，终于用天然气把矿砂直接炼成了钢。
    目前，天然气已被马海探区全面利用到了生产和生活上，这里已成了一个气化世界。　　（杨春贵　金梅）
