Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th: Cuban Provisional Government Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro issued a statement on the 15th, sternly warning the United States not to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. According to the Associated Press, Castro made this statement in response to recent declarations by some U.S. congressmen who twice called on the State Department to take action against Cuba in order to stop the provisional government from punishing Batista elements who committed serious crimes.

Castro said, "We want to maintain good relations with the United States—yes. But, to submit—impossible." Castro denied the deliberate fabrication by the American propaganda machine that portrayed him as a communist. He said, "I am not a communist. They call everyone who doesn't sell out to the Americans a communist... I won't sell out to the Americans, nor will I accept orders from the Americans." Castro also refuted the slander that there is no democracy or freedom in Cuba. He emphasized, "There is more freedom in Cuba than in the United States."

According to reports, Raul Castro, the brother of Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro, held a press conference in Santiago on the 15th. At the meeting, he strongly protested the intentional exaggeration of the provisional government's punishment of criminals as a "massacre." Raul Castro said that Batista's dictatorial army and secret police had massacred hundreds of thousands of people in the past six years, but when that happened, no one in the United States cried out about a "massacre."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: American reactionary groups, newspapers, radio stations, and television stations are intensifying their campaign against the new Cuban government. They are portraying Batista war criminals and executioners, who are being lawfully punished by the government, as innocent victims. They are clamoring with increasing frenzy for direct intervention in Cuba's internal affairs and the overthrow of the new Cuban government, seeking to "punish" the leaders of the uprising movement, and Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro.

According to the Associated Press, during a meeting held in the U.S. House of Representatives on the 15th, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Emanuel Celler suggested that President Eisenhower submit the Cuban provisional government's punishment of Batista criminals, a matter purely within Cuba's internal affairs, to the United Nations for "discussion." Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Wayne Hays also demanded that the U.S. government take some "tough economic measures," such as refusing to import sugar from Cuba, to put pressure on the Cuban government. Other U.S. congressmen, especially Styles Bridges, J. William Fulbright, Walter Judd, Wayne Morse and others, expressed similar sentiments. Senator Morse, Chairman of the Latin American Affairs Subcommittee, threatened to force Castro and his "accomplices" to "kneel." These congressmen were particularly concerned that the punishment of criminals might harm American interests in Cuba. Celler even twisted the Cuban provisional government's punishment of criminals, describing it as Cuba "undergoing a bloodbath."

News reports indicate that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roy Rubottom was summoned to attend a congressional committee on the same day. At the meeting, Rubottom was subjected to intense questioning: American congressmen demanded that he answer what actions the United States would take to stop the Cuban provisional government's punishment of Batista criminals. At the same time, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Wayne Hays emphasized at the meeting that the United States cannot adopt a "blind eye" attitude towards the current practices of the Cuban government.

American reactionary newspapers are publishing news of Cuban "mass executions," and television stations are broadcasting deliberately selected photographs to "prove" the "cruelty" of the new Cuban government. The American propaganda machine is attempting to use all these means to damage the reputation of the Cuban people and the new government.

However, it is clear from President Urrutia's statement in Havana, as well as from the talks of Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro and Interior Minister Rodriguez, how absurd and malicious the slanders of the American propaganda agencies are. According to a "New York Times" reporter's dispatch from Havana, the President's statement said that the punishment of war criminals is being carried out in accordance with the law and in compliance with all legal standards.

According to a United Press International reporter, Castro said at a press conference that the punishment of war criminals would continue until "the last murderer has paid his debt in blood." Castro told reporters, "You can tell them (the American reactionary groups—editor's note) that they should regret the kind of judgments that were made when the tyrant they supported was in power."

According to a "New York Times" reporter, the Cuban Interior Minister accused certain foreign journalists of deliberately distorting the facts by reporting "mass executions." He said that this was simply not the case. Only those who were heavily guilty and had confessed to their crimes were executed.

It is clear from the statements and the facts that the American propaganda agencies' hackneyed claims of persecution in Cuba are worthless, and it is also clear what their purpose is in doing so.

### 美国反动集团叫嚣要阻止古巴政府惩治杀人凶犯  卡斯特罗表示决不向美国干涉屈服

    美国反动集团叫嚣要阻止古巴政府惩治杀人凶犯
    卡斯特罗表示决不向美国干涉屈服
    新华社16日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府武装部队总司令卡斯特罗15日发表演说严正警告美国不要干预古巴的内政。据美联社报道，卡斯特罗说这番话，是由于一些美国议员最近曾经两次发表声明要求国务院对古巴采取行动，以便制止临时政府惩办那些犯有严重罪行的巴蒂斯塔分子。
    卡斯特罗说，“我们希望同美国保持良好关系——对的。但是，屈服——办不到。”卡斯特罗否认美国的宣传机器把他说成是共产党人的这种有意捏造的说法。他说，“我不是共产党人。他们把每一个不出卖给美国人的人称为共产党人……我不出卖给美国人，我也不接受美国人的命令。”卡斯特罗还驳斥了所谓目前在古巴没有民主和自由的谰言。他强调说，“古巴国内的自由要比美国的多”。
    据报道，古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗的弟弟劳尔·卡斯特罗15日在圣地亚哥举行了记者招待会。他在会上对有意把临时政府惩办罪犯夸大渲染成是“大屠杀”的说法提出强烈抗议。劳尔·卡斯特罗说，巴蒂斯塔独裁者的军队和秘密警察在过去的六年中曾经屠杀了成千上万的人，可是当那里发生这种事情的时候，在美国却没有人出来大叫大嚷说这是“大屠杀”。
    据新华社16日讯　美国反动集团、报纸、广播电台和电视台正在加紧进行反对古巴新政府的运动。它们把这个政府正在合法地惩办的巴蒂斯塔战犯和刽子手装扮成无辜的受害者，而越来越疯狂地叫嚣要直接干涉古巴内政和推翻古巴新政府，“惩治”起义运动领袖、古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗。
    据美联社透露，在美国众议院15日举行的一次会议上，众议院司法委员会主席伊曼纽尔·塞勒曾建议艾森豪威尔总统，把古巴临时政府惩办巴蒂斯塔罪犯这一纯属古巴内政的问题提交给联合国去“讨论”。外交小组委员会主席魏恩·海斯还要求美国政府采取例如像拒绝从古巴进口食糖那样的一些“强硬的经济措施”来对古巴政府施加压力。美国其他一些国会议员，特别是布·里奇斯、富布赖特、凯普哈特、莫尔斯等人也讲了同样味道的话。如参议院拉丁美洲事务小组委员会主席莫尔斯威胁说要迫使卡斯特罗和他的“同谋者”“屈膝”。这些议员们特别不安的是，对罪犯们的惩办可能会使美国在古巴的利益受到损失。塞勒还硬把古巴临时政府惩办罪犯说成是古巴“在经受一场浴血”。
    消息说，美国助理国务卿罗伊·鲁博特姆在同一天被召集参加国会的一个委员会。在这次会上，鲁博特姆受到猛烈的责问：美国议员们要求他答复美国将采取什么行动来制止古巴临时政府对巴蒂斯塔罪犯的惩处。同时，众议院外交小组委员会主席魏恩·海斯在会上强调美国不能对目前古巴政府的作法采取
  “熟视无睹”的态度。
    美国反动报纸纷纷刊登古巴
  “大规模枪决”的消息，电视台播送别有用心地挑选出来的照片以
  “证明”古巴新政府的“残酷”。美国宣传机器妄想用这一切手段来破坏古巴人民和新政府的名誉。
    但是，从乌鲁蒂亚总统在哈瓦那发表的声明、从古巴军队总司令卡斯特罗以及内政部长罗德里格斯的谈话中可以清楚地看到，美国宣传机构的谰言是何等的荒谬和别有用心。据“纽约时报”记者自哈瓦那报道，总统声明中说，对战犯的惩处是根据法律和在遵守一切法律标准的情况下进行的。
    据合众国际社记者报道，卡斯特罗在记者招待会上说，对战犯的惩处将继续到“最后一个杀人犯还清血债为止”。卡斯特罗对记者们说，“你们可以告诉他们（美国反动集团——原编者），应该为在他们支持的暴君执政时进行的那种判决感到惋惜”。
    据“纽约时报”记者报道，古巴内政部长指责某些外国记者故意歪曲事实地报道“大规模处决”的做法。他说，根本没有这回事。被处决的只是那些罪恶累累和已经供认罪行的人。
    从声明中和事实中可以清楚地看到，美国宣传机构所谓在古巴进行迫害的滥调是分文不值的，也可以看到他们这样作的目的是什么。
