Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. According to a report from our correspondent: Materials about mineral deposits recently published in Soviet newspapers indicate that the Soviet Union's iron ore reserves equal the total iron ore reserves of all capitalist countries, ten times more than the United States. Manganese ore reserves account for about 90% of the world's total reserves, equal to one hundred times that of the United States. If a comprehensive survey of natural gas is conducted in the Soviet Union, the United States, even according to the most optimistic estimates, will have one-third to one-half less than the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union possesses infinitely rich mineral resources. In terms of the variety and abundance of mineral reserves, the Soviet Union is unparalleled in the world. According to the already proven reserves, the Soviet Union's reserves of iron ore, oil, coal, natural gas, manganese, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum, mercury, mica, sulfur, and potash salts now rank first in the world. This is an important guarantee for the Soviet Union to carry out large-scale communist construction and to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in peaceful competition.

The Soviet Union's already explored iron ore reserves amount to 38.3 billion tons. If all these iron ores were mined, they could fill 15,443,548 trains, each with 62 cars. If all the trains were connected together, their length could circle the Earth's equator 284 times.

Long-term investigations in the Soviet Union have proven that natural gas reserves are nearly 19 trillion to 20 trillion cubic meters. If 30 billion cubic meters are extracted annually, as in 1958, these reserves can be extracted for at least about 670 years. This figure only refers to the reserves in one type of geological structure (anticlinal layers). The Soviet Union has not actually begun surveying the reserves in other types of strata.

The rich mineral resources of the Soviet Union are almost all over the republics, border regions, and states. The eastern regions (including the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia), which are the focus of construction in the Seven-Year Plan, have particularly large reserves of various minerals. They concentrate more than 88% of the Soviet Union's coal, four-fifths of the timber, and nearly 100% of the diamonds. There are also rich non-ferrous and rare metal deposits, as well as large amounts of iron ore, chemical raw materials, and building materials. It is estimated that the natural gas reserves in Siberia alone account for about one-third of the Soviet Union's total natural gas reserves. These rich resources provide very favorable conditions for the rapid economic development of the eastern regions.

In Siberia and the Far East, it has now been proven that rich iron ore is deposited in the area between the Angara and Pit Rivers. The proven iron ore reserves in this mining area are about 2.4 billion tons, and the estimated total iron ore reserves are about 5 billion tons. The Irkutsk Oblast and the Krasnoyarsk Krai are the largest coal mining areas in the Soviet Union. The geological reserves of coal in the Cheremkhovo, Tunguska, and Kansk-Achinsk coalfields there total more than 3 trillion tons. New mines and open-pit mines with an annual output of 100 million tons can be built in these coalfields.

The Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan has many types of minerals. Recent geological exploration results have proven that Kazakhstan ranks first in the Soviet Union in terms of iron ore reserves. In the next seven years, the Republic of Kazakhstan will be the key area for exploration and mining of iron ore. By 1965, Kazakhstan's total iron ore production will be more than half of Sweden's iron ore production in 1955, a famous European iron ore producing country. The Central Asian republics occupy an important position in the development of Soviet heavy industry. Proven materials show that the reserves of oil and natural gas in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan will be more than the reserves in the world-renowned Arabian Peninsula and Middle East countries. Turkmenistan is likely to become one of the richest oil regions in the Soviet Union. A 200-kilometer-long oil structure has been discovered near Bukhara in Uzbekistan; three fields with extremely rich sedimentary natural gas have also been discovered. This discovery makes the Bukhara region one of the largest natural gas producing areas in the world. The best antimony mines in the Soviet Union have been explored in the Tajik Republic, and non-ferrous metals, tungsten, fluorite, etc. are being mined. In Kyrgyzstan, in addition to minerals such as oil, aluminum, zinc, molybdenum, mercury, and coal, iron ore is also estimated to be present.

In addition to the large amount of natural resources in the eastern regions, the European part of the Soviet Union also contains various rich mineral deposits. The already explored oil reserves and mining areas in the Tatar and Bashkir Autonomous Republics, Kuibyshev, Saratov, Ulyanovsk, and Stalingrad Oblasts prove that they are one of the largest oil producing areas in the world. The discovery of the Belgorod-Oboyan iron ore area in 1954 greatly changed the economic situation in the central and southern parts of the European part of the Soviet Union. It has been proven that the richest iron ore is deposited under a layer about 100 kilometers wide and about 600 kilometers long. A rare iron ore area in the world will appear there.

### 共产主义建设和经济竞赛中获得胜利的重要保证  苏联遍地是宝　矿藏无限富饶  铁矿蕴藏量比美国多十倍等于资本主义世界各国总和

    共产主义建设和经济竞赛中获得胜利的重要保证
    苏联遍地是宝　矿藏无限富饶
    铁矿蕴藏量比美国多十倍等于资本主义世界各国总和
    新华社莫斯科8日电　本社记者报道：苏联报刊最近发表的有关矿藏的材料表明，苏联的铁矿蕴藏量等于资本主义世界各国铁矿蕴藏量的总和，比美国多十倍，锰矿储量约占全世界总储量的90％，等于美国的一百倍。如果对苏联的天然瓦斯进行全面勘察，美国即使根据最乐观的估计，也要比苏联少三分之一到二分之一。
    苏联拥有无限富饶的矿产资源，就矿产种类之多、储量之富来说，苏联是举世无双的。按已经探明的储量计算，苏联的铁矿、石油、煤、天然瓦斯、锰、铜、铅、锌、镍、铝、汞、云母、硫磺和钾盐等矿产的储量，现在都占世界第一位。这是苏联进行大规模的共产主义建设和在和平竞赛中赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家的重要保证。
    苏联已经探明的铁矿藏量达三百八十三亿吨，如果把这些铁矿全部开采出来，就可以装满一千五百四十四万三千五百四十八列各有六十二个车皮的列车，如果把所有的列车连在一起，其长度可以绕地球赤道二百八十四圈。
    苏联经过长期调查结果证明，天然瓦斯的储藏量将近达十九万亿到二十万亿立方公尺，如果今后像1958年那样每年开采三百亿立方公尺，那么这些储量至少可供开采约六百七十年。这个数字还只是指一种类型的地质结构（背斜层）方面的储藏量，对于其他类型地层的储藏量苏联实际上还没有开始勘察。
    丰富的苏联矿产资源差不多布满了所有加盟共和国、边疆区和州。而在七年计划中作为重点建设的东部地区（包括乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克、中亚细亚），各种矿藏的储量特别大。那里集中了全苏联88％以上的煤、五分之四的木材、将近100％的金刚石。那里还有丰富的有色金属和稀有金属矿藏，以及大量的铁矿、化学原料和建筑材料。据估计，单是西伯利亚地区的天然瓦斯储量就占苏联全部天然瓦斯储量的三分之一左右。这些丰富的资源为东部地区经济的飞速发展提供了十分有利的条件。
    在西伯利亚和远东地区，现在已经探明，在安加拉河和皮特河之间地带，蕴藏着丰富的铁矿，这个矿区的已经探明的铁矿储量约达二十四亿吨，估计铁矿的总储量大约达五十亿吨。伊尔库次克州和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区是苏联最大的煤矿区。那里的契列姆霍沃、通古斯、坎斯克—阿琴斯克等煤区的煤矿地质蕴藏量共达三万亿吨以上，在这些煤区可以建设年产一亿吨的新矿井和露天矿场。
    苏联哈萨克共和国的矿产种类是很多的。最近时期地质勘探的结果证明，哈萨克在铁矿储量方面占苏联第一位。今后七年内哈萨克共和国将是勘探和开采铁矿的重点地区。到1965年，哈萨克的铁矿砂总产量将比欧洲有名的铁矿砂出产国——瑞典1955年的铁矿砂产量多一半。中亚细亚各共和国在苏联重工业发展方面占有重要的地位。已经探明的材料证明，土库曼和乌兹别克石油和天然瓦斯的储量将比世界上闻名的阿拉伯半岛和中近东各国的蕴藏量还要多。土库曼很可能成为苏联最富饶的石油区之一。乌兹别克的布哈拉附近发现了长达二百公里的石油构造；还发现了三个有着极其富饶的带沉淀的天然瓦斯的产地。这一发现使布哈拉州成为世界上最大的天然瓦斯产区之一。在塔吉克共和国勘探出了苏联最好的锑矿，并且正在开采有色金属、钨、萤石等。吉尔吉斯的地下除埋藏有石油、铝、锌、钼、汞、煤等矿产，估计还有铁矿。
    除东部地区拥有大量的天然资源外，在苏联欧洲部分也蕴藏有各种各样丰富矿藏。鞑靼和巴什基尔自治共和国、古比雪夫、萨拉托夫、乌里扬诺夫和斯大林格勒州已勘探出的石油储量和矿地面积，证明是世界上最大的石油产地之一。在1954年发现的别尔哥罗德—奥博扬铁矿区，大大改变了苏联欧洲部分中部和南部的经济状况，已经探明，在横约一百公里、纵约六百公里的地层下蕴藏着最富饶的铁矿。那里将出现一个世界上少有的铁矿区。
