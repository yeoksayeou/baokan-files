    No U.S. Interference in Cuba's Internal Affairs!
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    After the establishment of the Cuban provisional government, at the request and with the support of the Cuban people, it imposed just sanctions and death sentences on a small number of criminals from the past Batista regime who were guilty of heinous crimes and had irrefutable evidence against them. People know that Batista, the running dog of U.S. imperialism, and his accomplices committed monstrous crimes against the Cuban people during their seventeen years of rule in Cuba. In the last seven years alone, the Batista regime killed 20,000 Cuban people. Countless others were brutally tortured, illegally detained, their families torn apart, and their homes destroyed. What is even more appalling is that the Batista elements adopted extremely brutal methods of slaughter; many "secret cemeteries" have been discovered throughout Cuba, and dozens or hundreds of corpses of victims collectively massacred by Batista elements have been exhumed! However, these heinous Batista elements are not reconciled to being overthrown. News indicates that Batista elements who fled to the United States and the Dominican Republic, together with their remaining accomplices in Cuba, are actively plotting to subvert the Cuban provisional government from within and without.

    Under these circumstances, in order to consolidate domestic order and completely crush the Batista's conspiracy to restore his regime, the Cuban provisional government needs to implement resolute suppression. To uphold justice, the Cuban provisional government must also implement resolute suppression, as Cuban Foreign Minister Agramonte said: "If we do not sanction these people, the families of the victims will not forgive us." All those who uphold justice believe that this measure by the Cuban provisional government is in the interests of the Cuban people, and in any case, this is Cuba's internal affair, and no foreign country has the right to interfere!

    On January 15, the U.S. State Department issued a special statement saying:
    "The United States' policy towards the Cuban revolution has always been one of strict non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs." It is not difficult to see that the United States issued this statement with the intention of deceiving the world and especially paralyzing the Cuban people. However, the lifespan of lies is really not long, and the United States punctured its own lie without anyone else having to do it. Just as the U.S. State Department issued the above statement, American reactionary groups, including some U.S. congressmen, and their propaganda newspapers launched a frenzy to obstruct the Cuban provisional government from punishing Batista's criminal elements. They clamored that the Cuban authorities' punitive measures were "inhumane" and "undemocratic," and they clamored for "sanctions" against Cuba. Moreover, on the same day that the U.S. State Department issued that statement, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Rubottom openly threatened the Cuban provisional government, saying that the "Cuban authorities should consider American public opinion." What could more clearly expose the face of U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs than these cries and threats?

    When people hear the U.S. imperialist elements shouting about "humanity," they cannot help but think of the "humane" treatment enjoyed by black people in the United States, such as being subjected to inhumane "lynching" of being burned alive. Under American "democracy," the "outstanding white citizens" who commit such crimes are often acquitted. Their "humanity" is not only manifested in the black people problem, but also towards the Cuban people. When the Batista regime used napalm bombs, tanks, artillery, and machine guns supplied by the United States to slaughter Cuban women and children, the U.S. imperialist elements did not think of "humanity." They never opposed the Batista elements' brutal acts of arbitrarily slaughtering captured members of the Cuban rebel forces. As Cuban President Urrutia stated in his statement, why did the United States not respond when the rebel forces had more than once notified the United States of the Batista elements' shooting and torturing of peaceful residents? Where did their "humanity" go?

    Speaking of so-called "undemocratic," even some people in the United States who can by no means be described as friendly to the Cuban people cannot help but admit that the Cuban provisional government's execution of Batista elements represents the will of the Cuban people. A *New York Times* reporter wrote: "It must be taken into account that to accuse the leaders of the rebel movement is to accuse the entire Cuban people, because the people support their government's measures." An Associated Press reporter said: "Every ordinary person in Cuba seems to fully support the execution of Batista elements on charges of war crimes." U.S. Congressman Porter declared: He did not see any evidence that the executions were carried out without fair trials. These facts, which even the Americans themselves have to admit, fully prove that punishing Batista's criminal elements is the unanimous demand of the Cuban people. Since it represents the will of the entire Cuban people, that is democracy!

    To reveal the truth, the reason why the U.S. imperialist elements want to launch a crusade to save the heinous Batista elements is not only because they fear that their running dogs in Cuba will be completely eradicated, and that it will affect the "morale" of their running dogs who are currently maintaining dictatorial regimes in countries such as the Dominican Republic and Paraguay, but more importantly, they are attempting to use this as a pretext for further interference in Cuba's internal affairs. Behind the so-called "humanity" and "democracy" lies the evil intention of restoring the pro-American Batista dictatorship.

    The U.S. imperialist attempt to impose a Batista regime on the Cuban people again is clearly a futile attempt. They have already expressed their determination to resolutely oppose U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs through the Cuban provisional government they support. In this regard, the Cuban people have the sympathy and support of all people in the world who uphold national independence and advocate justice, and the U.S. imperialists' shameless conspiracy to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs is being condemned by just world opinion.

    不许美国干涉古巴内政！
    本报评论员
    古巴临时政府成立后，在古巴人民的要求和支持下，对过去巴蒂斯塔政权中的少数血债累累、罪证确凿的犯罪分子，予以正义制裁，判处死刑。人们知道，美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔和他的同党在统治古巴前后十七年的期间，对古巴人民犯下了滔天罪行。仅仅在最后的七年，巴蒂斯塔政权就杀戮了两万古巴人民，其他惨受拷打、滥被拘禁、妻离子散、家破人亡的更是不计其数。更令人发指的是，巴蒂斯塔分子采用了极其残暴的屠杀手段；古巴全国各地已发现了不少“秘密墓地”，挖掘出了成十具、成百具惨被巴蒂斯塔分子集体屠杀的死难者尸体！然而这些罪大恶极的巴蒂斯塔分子还不甘心于被推翻。有消息说明，逃亡到美国和多米尼加去的巴蒂斯塔分子同他们的留在古巴的余党，正在积极策划里应外合地颠覆古巴临时政府。
    在这种情况下，为了巩固国内秩序，彻底粉碎巴蒂斯塔复辟的阴谋，古巴临时政府有必要实行坚决镇压；为了伸张正义，古巴临时政府也必须实行坚决镇压，正如古巴外交部长阿格拉蒙特所说的：“如果我们不制裁这些人，死难者的家属是不会宽恕我们的。”一切维护正义的人们都认为古巴临时政府这一措施是符合古巴人民利益的，而且，无论如何这是古巴的内政，任何外国都没有权利进行干涉！
    美国国务院在1月15日特地发表声明说：
  “美国对古巴的革命的政策一直是严格的不干涉古巴内政的政策”。不难看出，美国发表这篇声明是打算一手遮天地欺骗世人，特别是麻痹古巴人民。但是，谎言的寿命也真是不长，而且不用别人来戳穿它，美国自己就把它戳穿了。就在美国国务院发表上述声明的时候，包括一些美国议员在内的美国反动集团和他们的御用报纸掀起了一个企图阻碍古巴临时政府惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的狂潮。他们叫嚣说，古巴当局的惩治措施是“不人道的”、“不民主的”，他们喧嚷着要“制裁”古巴。而且就在美国国务院发表那篇声明的同一天，美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿鲁博特姆公然威胁古巴临时政府，要“古巴当局考虑美国的舆论”。还有什么能比这些叫嚣和威胁更清楚地暴露了美国干涉古巴内政的面目呢？
    当人们从美国帝国主义分子的嘴里听到关于“人道”的叫嚷的时候，首先就禁不住要想起美国黑人所享受的“人道”待遇，譬如遭受活活烧死等惨无人道的“私刑”。而在美国的“民主”下，犯下这种罪行的“优秀白色公民”往往是无罪开释。他们的
  “人道”不仅表现在黑人问题上，就是对于古巴人民也是一样。当巴蒂斯塔政权用美国供给的凝固汽油弹、坦克、大炮、机关枪屠杀古巴的妇女和儿童的时候，美国帝国主义分子就没有想到什么“人道”。他们也从来不反对巴蒂斯塔分子任意屠杀古巴起义部队的被俘人员的残暴行为。正如古巴总统乌鲁蒂亚的声明中所说的，为什么当起义部队曾经不止一次地把巴蒂斯塔分子枪杀和拷打和平居民的事情通知给美国，而美国对此却毫无反应？他们的“人道”跑到哪里去了呢？
    说到所谓“不民主”，那么，美国的一些绝对称不上对古巴人民抱友好态度的人，也不能不承认古巴临时政府对巴蒂斯塔分子的处决，代表着古巴人民的意志。“纽约时报”记者写道：“不能不考虑到，指责起义运动领袖也就是指责全体古巴人民，因为人民拥护他们政府的措施”。美联社记者说：“古巴每一个普通人民看来都完全支持以战犯的罪名处决巴蒂斯塔分子”。美国众议员波特尔宣称：他没有看到有任何证据证明处决是在没有经过公正的审讯以前进行的。这些连美国人自己都不得不承认的事实，充分证明了惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子是古巴人民的一致要求。既然是代表了全体古巴人民的意志，那就是民主！
    把事情揭穿来看，美帝国主义分子所以要发起一个拯救罪大恶极的巴蒂斯塔分子的十字军运动，不仅是因为害怕他们在古巴的走狗被斩草除根，就是害怕这会影响他们的目前还在多米尼加、巴拉圭这些国家中维持着独裁政权的走狗们的“士气”，而且更重要的是企图以此作为进一步干涉古巴内政的借口。在所谓“人道”，所谓“民主”的背后，隐藏着使亲美的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权复辟的罪恶。
    美帝国主义妄图再把一个巴蒂斯塔政权强加在古巴人民头上显然是枉费心机的。他们已经通过他们所支持的古巴临时政府，表达了坚决反对美国干涉古巴内政的意志。在这方面，古巴人民拥有世界上一切维护民族独立和主张正义的人们的同情和支持，美帝国主义干涉古巴内政的无耻阴谋正遭到世界公正舆论的谴责。
