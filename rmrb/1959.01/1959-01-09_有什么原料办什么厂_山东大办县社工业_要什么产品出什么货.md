    Make Factories Based on Available Materials
    Shandong Vigorously Develops County and Commune Industries
    Produce Whatever Products Are Needed
    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province is experiencing a vigorous mass movement to develop county and commune industries, striding forward towards the industrialization of the communes. According to extremely incomplete statistics from six special districts and cities including Liaocheng, Changwei, Jining, and Qingdao, in about 20 days in December last year, the counties and people's communes newly built and expanded more than 28,990 factories of various sizes, most of which have been put into production. Together with the approximately 800,000 factories and groups established before September of last year. These factories and groups not only directly serve agricultural production and the lives of commune members, but also produce many commodities for the state.

    Shandong Province began vigorously developing county and commune industries as early as the spring of last year. After the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site conference on vigorously developing county and commune industries in Gaotang County at the end of November, there was further development. Various localities, based on the principle of building factories based on available materials and developing industries to produce whatever products are needed, adopted the method of planning, constructing, and producing simultaneously, greatly accelerating the speed of factory construction. In a very short period of time, dozens of industrial projects such as iron and wood, machinery manufacturing and repair, textiles, paper making, ceramics, and glass were established. Liaocheng Special District is the banner for developing industry in the province. In about 20 days at the end of last year, they newly built and expanded more than 10,000 factories, which have produced more than 730,000 pieces of large and small iron and wood farm tools, and more than 6.3 billion catties of various kinds of local fertilizers, which strongly supported winter agricultural production; a large amount of flour, clothing, shoes and hats processed by machines... saved a lot of labor.

    The newly established factories are changing the situation in rural areas where there is only "agriculture" and no "industry." After a short period of vigorously developing county and commune industries, counties such as Yidu and Gaotang have basically formed a scattered industrial network of "machines ringing everywhere, industries all over the countryside and towns." Gaotang County had nearly 1,000 workers in 1957, but by the end of 1958, it had jumped to more than 18,000.

    The importance attached to and strengthened leadership by party committees at all levels in developing industry is the decisive key to running industry well. The first secretaries of party committees in various localities not only personally took command, grasping both agriculture and industry with both hands, but also specially established industrial headquarters to specifically lead industrial construction.

    "Small local groups" and self-reliance are the characteristics of developing industry in various localities, and are one of the important factors for the rapid development of various factories everywhere in a short period of time. Many areas have made do with whatever was available, using stone instead of wood, wood instead of iron and steel, and civilian houses instead of factory buildings, solving the difficulty of insufficient materials in building factories. Counties such as Jimo, Shanxian, and Wendeng also paid attention to the role of existing factories from the very beginning, using the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to manufacture a large number of local lathes, local gantry planers, diesel engines and other power machinery to equip the newly built factories of the people's communes; old factories also played an important role in training various technical workers for the people's communes.

    At present, the whole province has formed a lively situation of the whole party taking action and the whole people being mobilized to develop industry. In order to overcome the contradiction of "caring for industry and neglecting agriculture," many areas have reasonably and comprehensively arranged labor, organized professional teams, and divided the workforce into two groups for industry and agriculture. The relevant leading departments of the province believe that, from the perspective of the whole province, the leading personnel of individual counties have not yet established the idea of ​​simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, and their understanding of the importance of developing county and commune industries is insufficient, so their actions are slow. The relevant departments are preparing to take effective measures to promote the balanced and normal development of county and commune industries in the whole province, and further organize a high tide of vigorously developing county and commune industries.

### 有什么原料办什么厂  山东大办县社工业  要什么产品出什么货

    有什么原料办什么厂
    山东大办县社工业
    要什么产品出什么货
    本报讯　山东省各地人民公社正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的大办县、社工业的群众运动，向公社工业化昂首阔步迈进。据聊城、昌潍、济宁和青岛等六个专区、市的极不完全的统计，在去年12月的二十天左右的时间，各县、人民公社新建和扩建的各种具有一定规模的工厂就达到二万八千九百九十多个，并大部投入生产。连同去年9月以前建立的约达八十多万个。这些厂、组不仅直接服务于农业生产、社员生活，也为国家生产了不少商品。
    山东省大办县社工业，早在去年春季就已开始。11月底中共山东省委在高唐县召开大办县社工业现场会议之后，又有进一步的发展。各地依据有什么原料办什么工厂，要什么产品办什么工业的原则；采取边规划、边建设、边生产的方法，大大地加快了建厂速度，在很短的时间内，就兴办起铁木、机械制造修配、纺织、造纸、陶瓷、玻璃等几十种工业项目。聊城专区是全省办工业的旗帜，在去年年底的二十天左右的时间内，他们新建和扩建的一万多个工厂，已生产出七十三万多件大小铁木农具，各种土化肥六十三亿多斤，有力地支援了冬季的农业生产；用机器加工的大量面粉、服装鞋帽……，节约了大量的劳动力。
    新办的各种工厂，正在改变着农村只有“农”没有“工”的一条腿走路的状况。益都、高唐等县经过短期的大办县、社工业后，已基本上形成“到处机器响，工业遍城乡”的星罗棋布的工业网。高唐县1957年只有工人近千名，1958年底已跃增到一万八千多名了。
    各级党委对兴办工业的重视和加强领导，是办好工业的决定性关键。各地党委的第一书记不仅亲自挂帅，一手抓农业，一手抓工业；有关部门并且还专门成立了工业指挥部，具体领导工业建设。
    “小土群”和自力更生是各地兴办工业的特色，是各种工厂在短期内遍地开花的重要因素之一。很多地区都因陋就简，以石代木，以木代钢铁，以民房代替厂房，解决了建厂中材料不足的困难。即墨、单县、文登等县并且一开始就注意发挥旧有工厂的作用，用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法，制造大批的土车床、土龙门刨、柴油机等动力机械，装备人民公社新建的工厂；老厂在为各人民公社培养各种各样的技术工人方面，也起了重要作用。
    目前，全省已形成全党动手、全民动员的大办工业的生动局面。为克服“顾工丢农”的矛盾，不少地区都合理、全面地安排劳力，组织专业队伍，划分工农业两套人马。省的有关领导部门认为，从全省来看，仍有个别县的领导人员还没有很好地树立起工农业同时并举的思想，对发展县、社工业的重要性认识不足，因而行动迟缓，有关部门正准备采取有效措施，促使全省县、社工业均衡地正常发展，进一步组织大搞县、社工业的高潮。
