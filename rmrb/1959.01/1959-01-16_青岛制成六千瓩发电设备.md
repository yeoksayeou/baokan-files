Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, January 15th: Qingdao city's machinery factories, through collaborative efforts, have manufactured a set of 6,000 kilowatt power generation equipment. This set of equipment includes a 6,000 kilowatt generator, a 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine, and a 7,500 kVA transformer.

　　Factories involved in manufacturing this set of power generation equipment include the Qingdao Power Bureau Repair and Assembly Plant, the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, and the Qingdao Shengjian Machinery Factory. None of these factories had manufactured such equipment before. During this manufacturing process, they implemented the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, substituting simple for complex, using small resources to accomplish big tasks, and received support from fraternal factories, which resolved difficulties in technology, equipment, and raw materials. For example, when manufacturing the rotor, a key component of the 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine, the factory lacked nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy steel. The workers researched and used the sand-mold steel ingot casting method, preparing the materials themselves, which met the design requirements. The Qingdao Power Bureau Repair and Assembly Plant only had a two-ton I-beam, but in manufacturing the 7,500 kVA transformer, an eight-ton crane was needed to lift the transformer's iron core. After research by the workers, they used indigenous methods to reinforce the original I-beam and used a winch to lift the iron core, which solved the problem of insufficient crane capacity.

　　The quality of these power generation equipment is very good. They are currently being installed and will soon be generating electricity.

    青岛制成六千瓩发电设备
    新华社青岛15日电　青岛市机械工厂协作制成一套六千瓩发电设备。这套设备包括六千瓩发电机、六千瓩汽轮机和七千五百千伏安变压器。
    担任制造这套发电设备的有青岛电业局修配厂、青岛纺织机械厂、青岛生建机械厂等工厂。过去这些工厂都没有制造过这样的设备，这次制造时，贯彻了土洋并举的方针，以简代繁，以小干大，并得到兄弟工厂支援，使技术、设备和原材料方面的困难都解决了。比如，制造六千瓩汽轮机的主要机件转子时，工厂缺乏镍铬钼合金钢材，工人们就研究用砂模浇钢锭办法，自己配料制造，达到了设计要求。青岛电业局修配厂只有二吨的工字梁，而在制造七千五百千伏安变压器中，却需要八吨的吊车来吊变压器的铁芯；经过工人们研究，用土办法把原工字梁加固，用绞磨将铁芯绞起，结果解决了吊车能力不足问题。
    这些发电设备的质量都很好。目前正在安装，不久即可发电。
