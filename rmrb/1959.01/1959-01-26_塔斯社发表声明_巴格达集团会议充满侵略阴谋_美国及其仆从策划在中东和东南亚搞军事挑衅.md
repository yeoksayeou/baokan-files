Xinhua News Agency, January 25th dispatch: TASS Moscow dispatch: TASS issued a statement on January 24th regarding the upcoming meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council, stating that the Baghdad Military Treaty Council meeting will open on January 26th in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan.

The statement said that, according to all indications, the upcoming Baghdad Treaty Council meeting and the several meetings preceding it will primarily target Arab countries that are firmly pursuing independent national development paths. The statement pointed out: In this regard, Arab countries are paying close attention to the participation of US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson in the Council meeting. Henderson has long been known in Latin American countries and the Near and Middle East as an expert in plotting conspiracies against governments of independent countries that are not favored by the United States. Henderson's political face has long been clearly recognized by the residents of the United Arab Republic, due to his disgraceful role in jointly formulating the Turkish, American, and Israeli military offensive plan against Syria with the Turkish authorities at the end of 1957.

The statement said: The Baghdad Treaty Council meeting in Karachi is preparing to discuss the political situation in the Near and Middle East, especially the situation in the Republic of Iraq. This is an undisguised attempt by the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of independent countries in the region.

The statement said: While preparing for the Karachi meeting, certain participating countries of the Baghdad military bloc have launched a rampant provocative campaign against Iraq. As for Pakistan, it is also opposing India and Afghanistan. Pro-American newspapers in Iran openly advocate overthrowing the Iraqi government, considering it an "urgent need." "World News" and "Ferman News" brazenly shout about overthrowing the existing system in Iraq at any cost. Losing any sense of proportion and reality, they say that a "military offensive against Iraq" must be launched. They exposed the intentions of their masters across the ocean, even demanding the annexation of the oil-rich Mosul and Kirkuk regions in northern Iraq. Some members of the Iranian parliament also participated in this dirty propaganda campaign.

The statement said: It is noteworthy that the tension on the border between Iran and Iraq has increased to a certain extent. Foreign reactionary groups are organizing armed bandits in this area to send to Iraq to carry out subversive terrorist activities and incite ethnic disputes.

The statement said that, as can be seen from press reports, powerful groups in the United States and Britain are extremely alarmed by the victory of the Iraqi national revolution and the downfall of the Said group, which was subservient to the colonialists. They consider the struggle against the independent Republic of Iraq as the "main task" of the Baghdad Treaty's current policy and intend to use the upcoming Karachi meeting to achieve this goal. However, the participating countries of the Baghdad Treaty should not forget the bankrupt lessons of the aggressors' conspiracies against Iraq during the US and British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. Facts show that the Baghdad Treaty Organization was directly involved in the anti-republic conspiracy that was cracked down on in Iraq at the end of last year. All kinds of imperialist and reactionary forces participated in that conspiracy together. It is clear to everyone why imperialism, autocracy, and reactionaries are so hostile to the new Iraqi republican government. This is because the Iraqi government resolutely smashed the traitorous and anti-people system imposed on Iraq by the colonialist countries when the Iraqi reactionaries were in power.

The statement said that Pakistan is also threatening its neighboring countries. It is known that Pakistan recently experienced a military coup under foreign influence and established a military dictatorship. The Pakistani government has recently apparently sharpened its relations with its neighbors India and Afghanistan. Pakistani officials have even openly clamored for war with India, which is being instigated by certain foreign groups. The statement said: It goes without saying that only the imperialist forces are interested in hostility and inciting conflicts between Asian countries and peoples. They want to use this habitual trick to obtain some selfish benefits. On the contrary, the people of all countries in this region are deeply concerned about consolidating peace and developing mutual cooperation.

The statement pointed out that Turkey, an active participant in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Treaty, is particularly interested in the Karachi meeting. Although Turkey's domestic economic difficulties and opposition are constantly growing, Turkey is still brandishing weapons and unwilling to give up its aggressive and plundering intentions towards the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic and Iraq.

The statement said: It is completely understandable that peace-loving people of all countries are vigilant about the conspiracies of the US aggressive bloc. The US aggressive bloc is gradually dragging Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan into the quagmire of adventurous plans to prepare for a new war, using these countries' political and economic difficulties. The people of all countries can see very clearly that the spearhead of these sinister plans is first and foremost directed at the interests of peace, and at the Asian people's struggle for freedom, independence, and the elimination of colonialism.

The planners of the Karachi meeting do not conceal the fact that the United States intends to use this conference to conclude bilateral military agreements between the United States and Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. The Soviet government already expressed to the governments of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan its negative attitude towards the plans of these countries to conclude military agreements with the United States, because the purpose of these agreements is to aggravate international tensions and prepare for a new war in this region. Of course, based on the principles of the United Nations and the interests of safeguarding its own security and maintaining peace in the Near and Middle East, the Soviet Union cannot turn a blind eye to the plan to expand US military bases and military springboards on the territory of the aforementioned countries near the Soviet border.

Everyone knows that the governments of India, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other peace-loving countries have also condemned the plan of the United States to conclude bilateral military agreements with the aforementioned members of the Baghdad Treaty, considering these agreements a threat to international security in this region.

The statement said: There is no doubt that the United States is intensifying its activities in the Baghdad Treaty, preparing to conclude the aforementioned bilateral military agreements, which is actually to play a leading role in this aggressive bloc, while also attempting to use this method to replace the bankrupt "Eisenhower Doctrine." The US ruling clique also has one purpose in concluding bilateral military agreements, namely to further control the armies of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, as well as their national institutions and economies. At the same time, the ruling cliques of these countries, fearing their own people, are also willing to allow national interests to be harmed in this way. In this way, the United States is even more exposed as the pillar of the most reactionary and most tyrannical aggressive forces in Asia.

The statement said that the Soviet people warmly support the noble actions of the peace-loving people of all countries, who are defending their freedom and national independence, and resolutely condemn the activities of the United States and its Baghdad Treaty lackeys in plotting military provocations in the Near and Middle East and Southeast Asia. The interests of peace and the interests of international security in this region require the adoption of various measures to expose and stop the destructive activities of the aggressors, and require the establishment of trust and good-neighborly relations between countries and peoples on the basis of friendly and comprehensive cooperation in accordance with the lofty principles of the Bandung Conference and the purposes of the United Nations Charter.

The statement concluded: Before the meeting of the so-called Baghdad Treaty Council, some committees of this group have already held some secret meetings; among them, the "Anti-Subversion Committee," in which the American representatives played a particularly active role. Under the smokescreen of ambiguous words such as "subversive activities" and "the danger of international communist infiltration," it is no longer a secret to anyone that the American and British aggressive groups want to try their best to support the Baghdad Treaty, which is on the verge of collapse due to the devastating blow from the Iraqi revolution.

    塔斯社发表声明
    巴格达集团会议充满侵略阴谋
    美国及其仆从策划在中东和东南亚搞军事挑衅
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社24日就即将开幕的巴格达条约理事会会议发表声明说，巴格达军事条约理事会会议将于1月26日在巴基斯坦首都卡拉奇开幕。
    声明说，根据一切情况看来，即将举行的巴格达条约理事会会议和会前的几次会议，矛头将首先指向坚决走上独立的民族发展道路的阿拉伯国家。声明指出：在这方面，阿拉伯国家对美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊参加理事会会议一事很注意，汉德逊在拉丁美洲国家和中近东早就以策划反对美国所不中意的一些独立国家的政府的阴谋的专家而到处闻名的。由于汉德逊在1957年底在同土耳其当局共同拟定土耳其、美国和以色列对叙利亚的军事进攻计划中起了不光彩的作用，汉德逊的政治面目早已为阿拉伯联合共和国的居民认识得很清楚。
    声明说：在卡拉奇举行的巴格达条约理事会会议准备讨论中近东地区的政治局势问题，特别是讨论伊拉克共和国局势问题，这是美国干涉这一地区独立国家内政的无法掩盖的企图。
    声明说：在准备卡拉奇会议的同时，巴格达军事集团的某些参加国掀起了反对伊拉克的猖獗的挑衅性运动。至于说到巴基斯坦，则还反对印度和阿富汗。伊朗的亲美报纸公开鼓吹推翻伊拉克政府。认为这是“迫切需要的事情”。“世界报”和“弗尔曼报”放肆地叫喊不惜任何代价来推翻伊拉克的现存制度。它们丧失了任何分寸感和现实感，说必须“向伊拉克发动军事进攻”。它们暴露了大洋彼岸的主子的意图，竟要求吞并伊拉克北部富有石油的摩苏尔和基尔库克地区。伊朗议会的某些议员也参加了这种肮脏的宣传运动。
    声明说：值得注意的是，伊朗同伊拉克接壤的边界上的紧张局势有了一定程度的加剧。外国反动集团在这个地区正在组织武装匪帮以便派往伊拉克，去进行颠复恐怖活动并且煽起民族纠纷。
    声明说，从报刊上的消息可以看出，美英两国有势力的集团由于伊拉克民族革命的胜利和顺从殖民主义者的赛义德集团的倒台而极其惊惶，他们认为反对独立的伊拉克共和国的斗争是巴格达条约目前政策的“主要任务”，并打算利用即将举行的卡拉奇会议来达到这个目的。但是，巴格达条约的参加国不应该忘记侵略者在美英干涉黎巴嫩和约旦期间对伊拉克进行这种阴谋的破产的教训。事实表明，巴格达条约组织直接参与了伊拉克在去年年底所破获的反共和国阴谋，形形色色的帝国主义和反动势力都一起参加了那次阴谋。大家清楚地知道，为什么帝国主义、专制主义和反动派这样敌视新伊拉克的共和政府。这是因为伊拉克政府坚决粉碎了殖民主义国家在伊拉克反动派当权时强加给伊拉克的卖国反人民制度。
    声明说，巴基斯坦也对邻国进行着威胁。大家知道，在巴基斯坦不久前在外来的影响之下发生了军事政变并且建立了军事独裁制度。巴基斯坦政府最近显然要使它同邻国印度和阿富汗的关系尖锐化。巴基斯坦的官方人士甚至公开叫嚣同印度作战，这一点是受到某些外国集团的唆使的。声明说：不言而喻，只有帝国主义势力对亚洲各国和各国人民之间的敌视和煽动冲突感到兴趣，他们想利用这种惯伎来取得某种自私的利益。相反地，这个地区的各国人民则深切关心巩固和平和发展相互合作。
    声明指出，北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约的积极参加者土耳其对卡拉奇会议特别感兴趣。虽然土耳其国内的经济困难和反对情绪不断增长，但土耳其仍然挥弄武器，不愿意放弃对阿联叙利亚地区和伊拉克的侵略和掠夺意图。
    声明说：爱好和平的各国人民警惕着美国侵略集团的阴谋，这是完全可以理解的。美国侵略集团在一步步地把土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦拖下水，利用这些国家的政治困难和经济困难把它们拖进准备新战争的冒险计划的泥沼中去。各国人民都看得很清楚，这些阴险计划的矛头首先是指向和平的利益。指向亚洲人民争取自由、独立和消灭殖民主义的斗争。
    卡拉奇会议的策划人并不掩饰美国打算利用这次会议来缔结美国同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦之间的双边军事协定。苏联政府已经向土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三国政府表示过，它对这些国家同美国缔结军事协定的计划抱否定态度，因为这些协定的目的是加剧国际紧张局势和在这个地区准备新战争。当然，苏联本着联合国的原则和保障自己安全和维护中近东和平的利益，不能对在靠近苏联边境的上述国家领土上扩大美国军事基地和军事跳板的计划漠然视之。
    大家都知道，印度、阿富汗、伊拉克和其他爱好和平的国家的政府也谴责美国同上述巴格达条约成员国缔结双边军事协定的计划，认为这些协定是对这个地区国际安全的威胁。
    声明说：毫无疑问，美国加紧自己在巴格达条约中的活动，准备缔结上述双边军事协定，这实际上是要在这一侵略集团中起领导作用，同时企图用这种办法来代替破产了的“艾森豪威尔主义”。美国统治集团对缔结双边军事协定还抱有一个目的，即进一步控制土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦的军队以及它们的国家机构和经济。同时，这些国家的统治集团由于害怕本国人民，也甘心让民族利益受到这种损害。这样一来，美国就更加暴露了自己是亚洲最反动和最横暴的侵略势力的支柱。
    声明说，苏联人民热烈支持爱好和平的各国人民的崇高行动，他们捍卫着自己的自由和国家独立，并坚决谴责美国及其巴格达条约的仆从国在中近东和东南亚策划军事挑衅的活动。和平的利益和这个地区的国际安全的利益要求采取各种措施，来揭露和制止侵略者的破坏活动，要求根据万隆会议的崇高原则和联合国宪章的宗旨在友好和全面合作的基础上建立国与国之间和各国人民之间的信任和睦邻关系。
    声明最后说：在所谓巴格达条约理事会举行会议之前，这个集团的某些委员会已经举行过一些秘密会议；其中如“反颠复委员会”，美国代表在这个委员会中起着特别积极的作用。在“颠复活动”和“防止国际共产主义渗入的危险”等暧昧词句的烟幕下，掩盖着美国和英国侵略集团想极力支撑由于受到伊拉克革命的毁灭性打击而趋于崩溃的巴格达条约的企图，这对任何人都不再是什么秘密了。
