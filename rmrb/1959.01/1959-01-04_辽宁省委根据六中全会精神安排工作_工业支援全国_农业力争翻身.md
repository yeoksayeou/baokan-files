Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 3rd: The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Eighth Plenary (Enlarged) Session from December 16th to 27th. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, listened to reports from various municipal and district party committees on the completion of the 1958 production plan and the preparations for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1959, and arranged industrial and agricultural production for 1959 in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session.

Comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session were of great historical significance because they quickly and timely summarized a rich set of experiences from the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in China in 1958, and theoretically and politically resolved a series of issues concerning the rural people's communes, which is of great significance for guiding current work. It helped everyone clarify their thinking, clarify their direction, and solve the urgent problems existing in practical work, making everyone more full of confidence in victory in welcoming a greater leap forward in 1959 and striving for a complete turnaround in industrial and agricultural production in Liaoning Province.

The meeting pointed out that the tasks for 1959 are very arduous. Liaoning is the industrial base of the country. Therefore, in arranging all tasks, supporting the great construction of the whole country should be given top priority. While completing the task of supporting the whole country, striving for a turnaround in agriculture in Liaoning Province should be given the most important position.

The meeting formulated the Liaoning Province's industrial production and basic construction plans for the first quarter of 1959 and the agricultural production plan for 1959 based on the guidelines and targets for the development of the national economy in 1959 as outlined in the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The meeting studied whether Liaoning Province can achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production than last year while completing the arduous task of supporting national industrial construction. The meeting conducted a specific analysis of both favorable and unfavorable conditions, and believed that although there will still be some difficulties in agricultural production in 1959, such as labor shortages, colder climate, etc., the favorable conditions are generally greater: First, there is the experience of the great leap forward in 1958 and the foundation for water conservancy construction in 1958. Second, the preparation work for the great leap forward in agriculture in 1959 started at least three or four months earlier than in 1958. The great leap forward in agriculture in 1958 actually started in March, and the preparation work in 1959 started in October 1958. Moreover, there are still four or five months before sowing time, and a lot of preparation work can still be done. Third, cadres at all levels have undergone rectification, and the Agricultural Constitution has been implemented and has become a clear ideology guiding agricultural production. Fourth, the entire province has been communized, and there is the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" from the Sixth Plenary Session, which will play a huge role in promoting agricultural production development. These favorable conditions did not exist in 1958 and will exert infinite power in agricultural production in 1959. The meeting believed that under the past conditions, the people of Liaoning Province could create a 30% increase in grain production. Under such new and more favorable conditions, as long as the people of Liaoning Province continue to exert their efforts, use the complete set of experiences summarized by the Sixth Plenary Session, and work more cleverly and steadily, it is entirely possible to achieve a greater leap forward in grain production in 1959 on the basis of 1958. At the same time, in the industrial sector, the people of Liaoning Province also have the same strong confidence in completing the tasks for 1959.

According to the reports from various regions, the meeting believed that Liaoning Province had achieved great results in 1958, and both industrial and agricultural production had a great leap forward compared to 1957. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the province in 1958 will increase by more than 59% compared to 1957, which is more than the 45% accumulated during the first five-year plan. In the industrial sector, the total industrial output value of the province in 1958 actually increased by more than 66% compared to 1957. The output of various major products has largely exceeded the leap forward plan. In the agricultural sector, the total agricultural and sideline output value of the province in 1958 is expected to increase by 23.6% compared to 1957, grain will increase by about 30% compared to 1957, cotton will increase by 68% compared to 1957, and other crops and cash crops will increase by 20% to 30% compared to 1957. The meeting believed that these unprecedented and huge achievements are the result of the joint efforts of the entire party and the people of Liaoning Province under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee.

    辽宁省委根据六中全会精神安排工作
    工业支援全国　农业力争翻身
    据新华社沈阳3日电　中共辽宁省委员会在12月16日到27日举行了第八次全体委员（扩大）会议，会上传达了党的八届六中全会精神，听取了各市、地委对1958年生产计划完成情况和1959年工农业大跃进准备工作情况的汇报，并根据六中全会精神安排了1959年的工农业生产。
    与会同志一致认为六中全会的文件具有伟大的历史意义，因为它迅速而及时地总结了1958年我国工农业生产大跃进一整套丰富的经验，从理论上和政策上解决了农村人民公社一系列的问题，对指导当前工作上有巨大意义。它帮助大家澄清了思想，明确了方向，解决了实际工作中存在的急待解决的问题，使大家对于迎接1959年更大的跃进，争取辽宁省工农业生产彻底翻身更加充满了胜利的信心。
    会议指出：1959年的任务是很艰巨的，辽宁是全国工业的基地，因此，安排一切任务，应当把支援全国大建设放在首要地位。在完成支援全国任务的情况下，应当把争取辽宁省农业翻身问题放在最重要的地位。
    会议根据党的八届六中全会关于1959年国民经济发展的方针和指标，拟定了辽宁省1959年第一季度工业生产和基本建设计划以及1959年农业生产计划。
    会议研究了辽宁省在完成支援全国工业建设的艰巨任务的同时，能否做到农业生产比去年有更大跃进的问题，会议对有利条件与不利条件都进行了具体分析，认为在1959年农业生产中虽然还会有一些困难，如劳动力的紧张，气候较冷等等，但总的说来有利条件更多：第一，有了1958年大跃进的经验，有了1958年兴修水利的基础。第二，为1959年农业大跃进作准备的工作比1958年至少早三、四个月，1958年农业大跃进实际上是从3月份开始的，1959年的准备工作1958年10月就开始了。而且现在距播种时间还有四、五个月，还可以做很多准备工作。第三，各级干部都进行了整风，农业宪法已得到贯彻，成为指导农业生产的明确思想。第四，全省已经人民公社化，而且有了六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，这个决议对于促进农业生产发展将起到极大作用。这些有利条件都是1958年没有的，都将在1959年农业生产中发挥出无限的威力。会议认为，在过去的条件下，辽宁省人民能创造出粮食增产30％的成绩，在这样新的更加有利的条件下，辽宁省人民只要继续鼓足干劲，运用六中全会总结出的一整套经验，更巧更踏实的干，使1959年的粮食生产在1958年的基础上有更大的跃进，是完全可能的。同时，在工业方面，辽宁省人民也有同样坚强的信心，完成1959年的任务。
    根据各地汇报的情况，会议认为辽宁省1958年的工作获得了巨大的成绩，工农业生产都比1957年有很大的跃进。1958年全省工农业总产值将比1957年提高59％还多，为第一个五年计划累计的45％还多。工业方面，全省工业总产值1958年比1957年实际提高66％还多。各种主要产品产量，绝大部分都超额完成了跃进计划。在农业方面，全省1958年农副业总产值预计比1957年提高23.6％，粮食比1957年增加30％左右，棉花比1957年增加68％，其他农作物和经济作物都比1957年有20％到30％的增长。会议认为，这些空前巨大的成绩，是辽宁省全党和全体人民在党中央正确领导下共同奋斗的成果。（附图片）
