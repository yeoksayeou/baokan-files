The sounds of a unique melody of our era, filled with the triumphant confidence of the oppressed nations marching forward, are reverberating in the skies over the Caribbean Sea. The massive demonstration of one million people in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on January 21, marks a further upsurge in the Cuban people's national democratic revolutionary struggle.

Just imagine, a country with a population of only six million has one million people gathering in the capital to demonstrate. What a huge revolutionary scale and momentum this is! Cuba, located right under the nose of the strongest imperialist country, the United States, and subjugated to the iron claws of American capital for generations, has fearlessly shouted the just slogan of "Opposing American interference." What heroic spirit this is! The victorious leader of the insurgent forces, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Provisional Government of Cuba, Castro, firmly declared: "We hope to maintain good relations with the United States—yes, but submission—impossible!"

We are very pleased that the Cuban people, like us, also understand this truth: a tiger wants to eat people, not because people "provoke" it. Conversely, if Wu Song on Jingyang Ridge did not "provoke" the tiger, did not resolutely fight the tiger, wouldn't he have been eaten by the tiger long ago?

True, compared with the United States, Cuba is a small and weak country, and a small country right under the nose of the United States. However, if the United States dares to bring all its aggressive armed forces to bear on Cuba, what it will face is not only the resolute opposition of the six million Cuban people, but also the resolute opposition of the more than two hundred million people of all of Latin America, the billions of people of the oppressed nations of the world, and the extremely broad masses of people around the world, especially the people of the socialist camp countries. Besides this, there is also the opposition of the extremely broad masses of people in the United States itself who oppose war. The strength of socialism and national revolution in the world has far surpassed the strength of the imperialist aggression camp. Isn't it clear that the United States is just a paper tiger? Moreover, facts have proven: not long ago, wasn't the United States' armed aggression against tiny Lebanon and its subversive conspiracies against Iraq, Indonesia, Venezuela, Haiti, and other weak countries, all tragically defeated?

The conclusion is very clear: under the current international conditions, as long as the power of the people is fully mobilized and relied upon, and a resolute struggle is waged, small and weak countries are fully capable of achieving victory in the struggle against powerful imperialist aggression. Every such victory is a heavy blow to imperialism, the enemy of the people of the world, and a major contribution to the cause of peace and progress in the world. Our task, and the task of the people of the world, is to resolutely support the Cuban people and oppose American interference in Cuba. We firmly believe that the Cuban people's anti-American struggle will surely be victorious.

    古巴人民识破纸老虎
    廖盖隆
    在加勒比海的上空，正在响彻着我们这个时代所特有的，被压迫民族挺胸阔步、充满胜利信心的乐曲的旋律。1月21日，在古巴京城哈瓦那举行的一百万群众的大示威，标志着古巴人民民族民主革命斗争的更进一步的高涨。
    试想，一个只有六百万人口的国家，竟有一百万人聚集到首都来示威，这是何等巨大的革命规模和声势！一个处在最强的帝国主义国家美国的肘腋下、世世代代屈伏在美国资本的铁爪之下的古巴，竟然毫无畏惧地喊出了“反对美国干涉”的正义的口号，这又是何等的英雄气概！胜利的起义部队领袖、古巴临时政府武装部队总司令卡斯特罗坚定地宣称：“我们希望同美国保持良好关系——对的，但是，屈服——办不到！”
    我们非常高兴，古巴人民同我们一样，也懂得了这个真理：老虎要吃人，并不是因为人去“刺激”了他。反过来说，如果景阳岗上的武松不去“刺激”老虎，不去坚决地同老虎作斗争，他岂不早就给老虎吃掉了吗？
    不错，和美国比较，古巴是一个弱小的国家，而且是美国肘腋之下的一个小国。但是，如果美国敢把它全部侵略武装力量压到古巴的头上，它所面对的，不仅是六百万古巴人民的坚决反对，而且是全拉丁美洲的上两亿人民、全世界被压迫民族的十几亿人民以及全世界极其广大的人民而特别是社会主义阵营各国人民的坚决反对，除此以外，还有美国本身反对打仗的极其广大的人民的反对。全世界社会主义和民族革命的力量已经大大超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。美国不过是一只纸老虎，这难道还不明白吗？况且，事实证明：不久以前，美国对于小小的黎巴嫩的武装侵略、对于伊拉克、印度尼西亚、委内瑞拉、海地等等弱小国家的阴谋颠复活动，不是都悲惨地失败了吗？
    结论是很清楚的：在当前的国际条件下，只要充分发动和依靠人民的力量，进行坚决的斗争，弱小的国家在反对强大的帝国主义侵略的斗争中，是完全能够取得胜利的。这样的每一个胜利，都是对于全世界人民的敌人帝国主义的沉重打击，都是对于全世界的和平和进步事业的重大贡献。我们和全世界人民的任务，就是坚决地支援古巴人民，反对美国干涉古巴。我们坚信，古巴人民的抗美斗争必将取得胜利。
