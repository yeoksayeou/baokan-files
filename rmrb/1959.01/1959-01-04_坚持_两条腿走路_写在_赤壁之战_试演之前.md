Adhere to "Walking on Two Legs"
——Written Before the Premiere of "Battle of Red Cliffs"
Ma Shaobo

Every time people recite Su Shi's "The great river flows eastward, the waves have swept away, the historical figures of the ages... Amidst laughter and banter, the powerful enemy vanished in smoke..." "Remembering the Past at Red Cliffs," they can't help but think of and cheer for Chairman Mao's famous line: "...They are all gone, to truly count the outstanding figures, we must look to the present!"

It is to celebrate this unprecedentedly prosperous and flourishing "present" of our country - the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that we, with the close care of the Party and the audience, have adapted and staged the Peking Opera "Battle of Red Cliffs." It will soon be premiered in Beijing by the China Peking Opera Theater and the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe. We plan to widely solicit opinions from the audience, continue to revise and refine it, and strive to gradually make it one of the key programs to celebrate National Day this year.

We also have the following thoughts on adapting "Battle of Red Cliffs":

In order to make Peking Opera more vital and better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, since last year, we have been trying to focus on solving two problems in art, according to the principle of "walking on two legs": On the one hand, to better inherit and carry forward the tradition, and reorganize and adapt excellent traditional plays. On the other hand, to enable Peking Opera art to appropriately express the modern people's lives and struggles, that is to say, to adhere to "walking on two legs," boldly innovate on the basis of tradition, and bring Peking Opera art to a higher level commensurate with the new era, and be forever loved and enjoyed by the masses.

Generally speaking, in the past we have adapted a considerable number of excellent traditional Peking Opera plays, but we have not paid attention to further improving excellent and relatively well-established traditional plays like "The Gathering of Heroes". This type of play has had a very profound and extensive impact on the audience for many years. According to conventional wisdom, it seems that there is almost no room for further processing. In fact, this is a kind of superstition. If these excellent traditional plays are not reformed and improved ideologically and artistically, and always stagnate at the current level, even if they are excellent, they will "not advance, then retreat" and be left behind by the great leap forward of the times, which is a great pity! Therefore, we would like to conduct a little experiment on the issue of further creatively adapting excellent traditional plays.

Although it took a lot of courage to gnaw at this "hard bone," initially, due to insufficient ideological liberation, the first two drafts, totaling more than sixty scenes, were actually just a compilation and embellishment of the old script, without breaking away from the shackles of the old script and fundamentally making up for the shortcomings of the old script. Later, after some theoretical discussion, it was unanimously agreed that we should break superstitions and promote the spirit of originality. Therefore, we reorganized our forces, formulated a new outline, and started re-creation, which resulted in the current second draft.

This time, the draft has been changed to one play, with sixteen scenes: One, "Despising the South of the Yangtze"; Two, "Deciding to Cross the River"; Three, "Alliance Established"; Four, "Bestowing Command"; Five, "Stealing the Book"; Six, "Falling into the Trap and Executing the General"; Seven, "Fire Attack Plan"; Eight, "Borrowing Arrows"; Nine, "Hitting the Cover"; Ten, "Catching Cold from Watching the Wind"; Eleven, "Dragon and Tiger Winds and Clouds"; Twelve, "Reciting Poetry with Spear Across the Saddle"; Thirteen, "Heroic Farewell"; Fourteen, "Borrowing the East Wind"; Fifteen, "Burning the Red Cliffs"; Sixteen, "Fierce Battle and Cao's Defeat". In addition to adding some new scenes according to the needs of the theme, the original essence has been preserved as much as possible. On the basis of the original, some changes and enrichments have been made.

The Battle of Red Cliffs is one of the most famous battles in ancient China. The result of this war basically determined the situation of the three-way division of Wei, Shu, and Wu. It embodies the correct or incorrect military strategic thinking in ancient Chinese warfare, and also demonstrates the political talents of Chinese historical figures. In novels, operas, poetry, and lyrics, the predecessors used a creative method combining realism and romanticism to brilliantly depict the image of "the landscape is like a painting, and there were so many heroes at that time." Cao Cao, Liu Bei, Kong Ming, Sun Quan, Zhou Yu, Lu Su, and Huang Gai, after generations of mass creation, have had their wisdom idealized in artistic works. This romantic color should be especially cherished and carried forward.

In the adaptation work, we have tried to analyze the success or failure of this battle from the perspective of historical materialism, on the basis of tradition, hoping to be able to reflect the face of the times at that time more realistically and artistically. In art, we hope to be able to carry forward the essence and achieve "bringing forth the new through the old" in the spirit of "adding flowers to brocade". Therefore, we have made some additions and deletions to the old script, and tried our best to make the stitches fine and dense, so that the traces of axe cutting are not visible, and it becomes a unified artistic whole. We must be bold in innovation, and at the same time take care of the audience's legitimate traditional habits. Some innovative attempts will be made in performance, singing, music, makeup, and scenery. In terms of character images and character relationships, we have tried to more clearly express Cao Cao's erroneous strategic thinking. At that time, Cao Cao should have made peace with Sun Quan and taken advantage of the victory to pursue and annihilate Liu Bei, but he was arrogant and underestimated the enemy, did not pay attention to strategy, sent a dispatch to Jiangdong, and coerced Sun Quan, which instead promoted the gradual formation of the Sun-Liu alliance. Coupled with errors in military command, it finally led to defeat. The revised version attempts to clarify the war situation with this, and highlight strategic thinking. But while exposing Cao Cao's miscalculation, it still does not make him lose the true colors of an outstanding politician, military strategist, and poet of ancient times; for Lu Su, it attempts to show the wise image of this organizer who insisted on the correct line of uniting with Liu to resist Cao; Zhou Yu has very high military talent, we have tried to write about his certain political shortsightedness in the united front, but also to write about his noble and elegant side; Huang Gai, in the name of feigned surrender, drove "Meng Chong Dou Vessels," loaded with grease and firewood, and rushed into Cao's fleet in the fierce wind, which was actually a heroic act of "sending explosives". We want to make this loyal and fearless hero's image more full; Jiang Gan is certainly a laughable character, but according to records, Jiang's debating skills "were unparalleled in the Jianghuai area, and no one could match him." Although this time he is still played by a clown, we try our best to maintain his scholarly demeanor. For example, Liu Bei's grace and magnanimity, Sun Quan's handsome and wise, Kong Ming's deep thoughts and far-sightedness, etc., we hope to express them fully. In addition, in the revised version, the image of Zhang Zhao, the leader of the pro-surrender faction in Eastern Wu, is established. Zhang Zhao was a highly authoritative figure in Eastern Wu. He was a very important opposite side in the war and surrender between Eastern Wu and even the Sun-Liu alliance. Establishing this image is beneficial to the twists and turns of the internal and external struggles of the united front, that is, to the development of the plot.

Whether these ideas are correct remains to be tested by specific artistic practice and everyone's discussion and guidance. Due to our limited abilities, even if there are some good ideas, there is likely to be a large distance between them and the practical effect. But under the leadership of the Party and the enthusiastic support of the audience, we firmly believe that we will gradually make it better.

    坚持“两条腿走路”
    ——写在“赤壁之战”试演之前
    马少波
    每当人们吟诵苏轼的“大江东去，浪淘尽、千古风流人物……谈笑间、强虏灰飞烟灭……”的“赤壁怀古”的时候，总会情不自禁地联想到和欢呼出毛主席的名句：“……俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝！”
    就是为了庆祝这个我国空前昌盛繁荣的“今朝”——中华人民共和国建国十周年，我们在党和观众们的亲切关怀之下，改编排演了京剧“赤壁之战”，最近将由中国京剧院和北京京剧团在北京试演。准备广泛征求观众的意见，继续修改加工，争取逐渐成为今年庆祝国庆的重点节目之一。
    改编“赤壁之战”，我们还有如下的想法：
    为了使京剧更有生命力，更好地为工农兵服务，去年以来，我们根据“两条腿走路”的原则，想在艺术上着重解决两个问题：一方面更好地继承和发扬传统，整理改编优秀的传统剧目。另一方面，使京剧艺术也能够适当地表现现代人民的生活和斗争，这就是说，要坚持“两条腿走路”，在传统的基础上大胆革新，使京剧艺术达到和新时代相称的更高的水平，永远为群众所喜闻乐见。
    一般说来，过去我们改编的优秀的京剧传统剧目是不算少的，但是对于像“群英会”这一优秀和相当定型的传统剧目，却一直没有注意去进一步提高。这一类型的剧目，多年以来在观众中已有极深广的影响，按照习惯看法，几乎以为没有什么再加工的余地了。其实，这是一种迷信。这类优秀的传统剧目，假如不从思想性、艺术上加以革新和提高，老是停滞在现有水平上，纵然优秀，也会“不进则退”，被抛在时代大跃进的后面，非常可惜！因此，我们想就进一步创造性地改编优秀传统剧目的问题，进行一点尝试。
    虽然要啃一啃这根“硬骨头”，最初还是鼓了不小的勇气的，但是，由于思想解放不够，第一次两部戏稿写成以后，竟达六十余场，实际上仅是一种老本的编串润色的工作而已，并没有摆脱老本的束缚，从根本问题上来弥补老本的不足。后来经过一番务虚，一致认为应该破除迷信，发扬独创精神，于是，重整旗鼓，拟定了新的提纲，着手再创作，这才写出了现在第二次的稿本。
    这次稿本改成一部戏，共有十六场：一、“藐江南”、二、“决策过江”、三、“盟成”、四、“拜将”、五、“盗书”、六、“中计斩将”、七、“火攻计”、八、“借箭”、九、“打盖”、十、“观风得病”、十一、“龙虎风云”、十二、“横槊赋诗”、十三、“壮别”、十四、“借东风”、十五、“火烧赤壁”、十六、“鏖兵败曹”。除根据主题需要，增加了一些新场目外；原有的精华部分都尽量的保留下来。在原有基础上，进行了一些改动和丰富。
    赤壁之战是我国古代著名的战役之一。这次战争的结果，基本上决定了魏、蜀、吴鼎足三分的局面。它既体现我国古代战争中正确的或错误的军事战略思想，也表现了我国历史人物的政治才能。前人在小说、戏曲、诗词中，用现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，出色地描绘了“江山如画，一时多少豪杰”的形象。曹操、刘备、孔明、孙权、周瑜、鲁肃、黄盖这些人物，经过历代群众的创作，在艺术作品中，把他们的智慧更理想化了。这种浪漫主义的色彩，是应该特别加以珍视和发扬的。
    在改编工作中，我们试图在传统的基础上，以历史唯物主义的观点，来分析这个战役的成败所在，希望能够比较真实而又艺术地反映出当时的时代面貌。在艺术上，希望能够做到以“锦上添花”的精神，发扬精华，达到“推陈出新”。因而对老本有所增删，尽量作到细针密线，使之看不出斧斫的痕迹，成为一个统一的艺术整体。既要大胆革新，同时又要照顾到观众的正当的传统习惯。对表演、唱腔、音乐、扮相、布景都将进行某些革新的尝试。在人物形象和人物关系方面，我们试图较明确地表现出曹操的错误的战略思想。在当时，曹操应该和好孙权，乘胜追歼刘备，但他骄兵轻敌，不讲策略，驰檄江东，胁迫孙权，反而促使了孙刘联盟的逐步形成，加以军事指挥上的错误，最后招致失败。改本试图以此廓清战争形势，并突出战略思想。但在暴露曹操失算的同时，仍使之不失古代一位出色的政治家、军事家和诗人的本色；对鲁肃，试图表现出这个坚持联刘拒曹的正确路线的组织者的贤明形象；周瑜是有很高的军事才华的，我们试图写出他在联合战线中所表现的一定的政治短见，但也写出他为人高量雅致的一面；黄盖以诈降为名，驱乘“蒙冲斗舰”，装载膏油薪草，在火烈风猛中，冲击曹兵船队，实际上是一种“送炸药”的英勇行为，我们想使这个忠勇无畏的英雄形象更为饱满一些；蒋干当然是个可笑的人物，但据记载：蒋的辩才“独步于江淮之间，莫与为对”。这次虽然仍以丑角当行，但尽量保持他的名士气度。他如，刘备的雍容大度，孙权的英俊明智，孔明的深谋远虑等等，都希望表现得充分一些。此外，在改本中，树立了东吴主降派首脑分子张昭的形象。张昭在东吴是一个地位很高的权威人士，他在东吴战降之间以至孙刘联盟当中，是一个很重要的对立面。树立起这个形象，对联合战线的内外部斗争的曲折性，也就是对剧情的发展，是有好处的。
    这些想法是否正确，还有待于具体的艺术实践和大家的探讨指教。由于我们的能力有限，即使有些良好的想法，也很可能和实践效果之间存在着较大距离。但在党的领导和观众们的热心支持之下，我们坚信会逐步地把它搞得更好些。
