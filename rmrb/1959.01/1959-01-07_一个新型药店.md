    A New Type of Pharmacy
    Sun Jin
    The Hongqiao District of Tianjin has created a new type of pharmacy - the state-run Hongqiao Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Pharmacy. This pharmacy sells traditional Chinese medicine and also Western medicine; it is both a pharmacy and a clinic; it has both traditional Chinese medicine doctors and Western medicine doctors. Since the opening of this pharmacy, it has been very popular among the masses.

    The pharmacy currently has 13 medical personnel (six traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors, four nurses, and three pharmacists), and 23 salespersons. They work in shifts day and night, providing consultation and service, bringing great convenience to the people of Hongqiao District.

    In a small courtyard, the pharmacy has a registration desk, injection room, Western medicine dispensing room, traditional Chinese and Western medicine diagnosis room, surgery room, traditional Chinese and Western medicine retail department, and simple hospital beds. It resembles a comprehensive medium-sized "hospital." However, it is different from a hospital. A hospital only treats patients and does not sell medicine retail. This pharmacy both treats patients and sells medicine. Patients can choose to see a doctor and take medicine, or they can ask a salesperson at the retail department for a prescription and take medicine without seeing a doctor. Although the pharmacy does not have advanced medical equipment, its procedures are simpler than a hospital. Patients can see a doctor by simply registering and taking a number, and they can get medicine in the next room after seeing the doctor. Especially after seeing a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, patients can get their medicine without leaving the pharmacy, eliminating the need for patients to go to the pharmacy to collect the medicine. If patients cannot decoct the medicine themselves, the pharmacy can decoct it for them. If patients need to be hospitalized due to lack of care or small living space, they have simple hospital beds with simple equipment and low fees, which is both economical and convenient. If patients prefer to stay at home, they also have home sickbeds, with doctors and salespersons from the pharmacy responsible for medical treatment and nursing. The pharmacy's salespersons are also community health workers. They divide the surrounding area into sections and go deep into the homes of residents. Their slogan is: "Every alleyway is managed, every household is visited, minor illnesses are treated within the alleyway, and medicine is bought without leaving the house." Adhering to the principle of treating diseases in their early stages and the policy of prevention first, they promote seasonal medicines to residents based on seasonal climate changes and teach people nursing knowledge. When the pharmacy's doctors are not busy, they also visit homes for key medical treatment, without charging consultation fees or travel expenses. They aim to ensure that the area they are responsible for is healthy and strong, and not subject to the invasion of disease epidemics. The pharmacy's approach is actually equivalent to establishing a community healthcare area.

    The pharmacy's salespersons are also community health workers at the counter. They expand the scope of asking about illnesses and taking medicine. For general minor illnesses that do not require diagnosis, salespersons can prescribe medicine for patients. Traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors also strive to quickly cure diseases and alleviate patients' suffering. In addition, they have also prepared special service personnel for patients, responsible for assisting the elderly and young, taking care of seriously ill patients, and introducing decoction methods and medication knowledge. When patients take medicine there, the service personnel will serve the medicine, pour water, and take care of everything. The service personnel here are also responsible for delivering medicine to elderly, widowed, orphaned, and disabled patients. Everyone in this pharmacy is responsible for patients and cares for patients, treating patients as their own relatives. In the eight days since its opening, it has received 170 written commendations from patients.

    In the past, medicine and pharmacy were separated, traditional Chinese and Western medicine were separated, and traditional Chinese and Western medicine were also operated separately. Therefore, doctors paid attention to studying medical theory and rarely studied medicinal properties. Salespersons were familiar with medicines but lacked medical knowledge. Establishing such a pharmacy can achieve the integration of medicine and pharmacy, so that doctors can extensively study medicinal properties and improve medical effects. Salespersons can also learn medical theory under the guidance of doctors and better serve patients. Secondly, traditional Chinese and Western medicine are combined, so that traditional Chinese medicine doctors can learn Western medicine, and Western medicine doctors can also learn traditional Chinese medicine at any time, gradually achieving a doctor who understands both traditional Chinese and Western medical theory, and can also effectively solve patients' difficult and complicated diseases through traditional Chinese and Western medicine consultations. Furthermore, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine can achieve the complementary use of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, improve medical efficacy, and also help traditional Chinese medicine gradually move towards scientificization.

    Because this pharmacy both treats patients and sells medicine, has both traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors, and sells both traditional Chinese and Western medicine, it relieves patients' pain and suffering. In ten days, more than 5,000 patients have come for treatment, including more than 2,000 who registered for treatment and more than 3,000 who asked about illnesses and took medicine. The daily sales of medicine have also increased from 400 yuan to 800 yuan. Historically, there have been people who strolled in shopping malls and people who went to fairs and temples, but no one strolled in pharmacies. As the saying goes, "People don't go to old pharmacies unless they are sick." Since the establishment of this new type of pharmacy, this situation has changed. Many people visit every day. Many residents are satisfied after seeing it. An old man in his seventies told the salesperson about his illness. The salesperson prescribed medicine for him. He bought the medicine and walked into the courtyard, giving a thumbs up and saying:
    "Very good, very good, really good. The Party rectification was not in vain. The establishment of this pharmacy has brought good news to our area." The salesperson also went deep into the community to provide nursing visits and treated more than 20 patients. For example, when salesperson Wang Yu visited a household for nursing on Dafeng Road No. 7, she found an old lady surnamed Li taking care of several children whose parents were at work. One of them was running a high fever, and the old lady didn't know what to do. Comrade Wang Yu immediately inquired about the condition, observed the symptoms, and determined the child's condition. She comforted the old lady, went back to get the medicine, treated the child, and taught the old lady nursing knowledge. That night, the child's condition improved and the fever subsided. When the child's father came home from work, he heard about the situation and rushed to the pharmacy to thank him in person, saying many words of gratitude and praising the salesperson's spirit of being responsible for the people.

    一个新型药店
    孙津
    天津市红桥区创造了一个新型药店——国营红桥中西药店，这个药店卖中药，也卖西药；是药店又是医院；有中医，又有西医。自从这个药店开幕以后，很受群众欢迎。
    这个药店，现有医务人员十三人（中西医生六人、护士四人、调剂员三人），售货员二十三人，每天交叉上班，昼夜应诊和营业，给红桥区人民带来了很大的便利。
    这个药店在一个不大的院子里，设有挂号处、注射室、西药调剂室、中西医诊断室、外科室、中西药零售部和简易病床。好像一个综合性的中型“医院”。但是，他与医院又不同，医院只看病，不零售药，这个药店又看病、又卖药，患者愿意看病服药也可，不愿找医生看，在零售部找售货员问方吃药也可。这个药店虽没有高级医疗设备，但它比医院的手续简单，挂了号拿个牌就看病，而且是这个屋看了病那个屋就可以取药，尤其是中医看了病，病人不出院就可把药取走，不再叫患者跑到药店去抓药，患者自己煎不了药，总店可代煎。如果病人无人照顾需要住院，或者家庭房屋窄小，他们有简易病床，设备简单，收费很少，既经济，又方便。患者愿意在家里，他们还有家庭病床，由药店的大夫和售货员负责医疗和护理。药店的售货员，也是居民的护理员，他们把周围地区实行按段分工、深入到居民家中去。他们的口号是：巷巷有人管，家家有人去，小病不出巷，买药不出门。他们按照病从浅治的道理，预防为主的方针，根据季节气候变化，向居民宣传时疫药品，教给人民护理知识。药店的大夫在不忙时，也下户重点医疗，既不收诊费，也不要车资。他们要作到所管地带人强马壮，不受疾病流行的侵袭。这个药店的作法，实际上等于设立了一个地段医疗区。
    药店的售货员，在柜台上还是人民的护理员。扩大了问病吃药，一般小病，不需要诊断的，售货员可以替患者处方，对症卖药。中、西医生，也尽量作到迅速治好病症，减轻患者痛苦。此外，他们还专门为患者预备了服务员，在药店负责扶老携幼，照顾重病患者，介绍煎药方法和服药知识等。遇到在那里吃药的患者，服务员就端药、倒水，照顾一切。这里的服务员，还负责对鳏、寡、孤、独的患者，实行送药上门。这个药店的每一个人，都为患者负责，都为患者着想，拿患者当自己的亲人看待。开幕八天，就得到患者一百七十件书面表扬。
    过去医药分家、中西医分家、中西药也各自经营。因此，医生注意研究医理、很少研究药性。售货员对药品熟悉，缺乏医疗知识。建立这样一个药店，可以达到医药结合，医生可以广泛研究药性，提高医疗效果。售货员也可在医生指导下，学会医理，更好地为患者服务。其次，中、西医结合，中医可以学习西医、西医也可随时学习中医，逐步达到一个医生既懂中医医理，又懂西医医理，还可通过中、西医会诊有效地解决患者疑难病症。再者，中、西药结合，达到中、西药互相补充使用，提高医疗效能，也有利于中药逐步走向科学化。
    由于这个药店又看病又卖药，有中医又有西医，卖中药又卖西药，为病人解除了疾病痛苦，十天的功夫，前来治疗疾病的患者达五千多人次，其中挂号治疗者两千多人次，问病吃药的三千多人次，每天卖药的金额也由四百元增到八百元。历史上有蹓商场的，有赶集上庙的，没有蹓药铺的，俗语说：“没病不进老药铺”。而这个新型药店建立以来，改变了这种情况，每天都有很多人参观。不少的居民看了以后都感到满意。有一个七十多岁的老大爷，向售货员诉说了自己的病情，售货员替他出方，他买了药，走到院子里，翘着大拇指说：
  “真好，真好，真是好，党整风没白整，建立这个药店，给我们这一方带来了好福音。”售货员还深入居民中护理访问，治疗了二十多个病人，如售货员王玉，在下户访问护理时，在大丰路七号发现一个姓李的老大娘，在家看着几个父母上班的小孩，其中有一个正在发高烧，老大娘不知如何才好。王玉同志当时就询问了病情，观察了症状，判断清小孩的病情，他安慰了老大娘，又回去取了药，给小孩治疗，并且教给了老大娘护理知识，当晚，小孩病情好转，退了烧。小孩的父亲下班后，听到这种情况，赶到药店登门道谢，说了许多感谢的话，表扬了售货员为人民负责的精神。
