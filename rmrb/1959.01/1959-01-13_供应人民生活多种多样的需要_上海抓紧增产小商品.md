To Supply the Diverse Needs of the People's Lives
Shanghai Seizes the Opportunity to Increase Production of Small Commodities

    This newspaper reported from Shanghai on the 12th: While grasping the procurement and supply of large commodities, Shanghai's commercial departments are actively organizing the production and supply of small commodities, striving to meet the diverse needs of people's lives.
    Small commodities, including small general merchandise, small hardware, and various bamboo and wood household utensils, are commonly needed in people's lives. The Finance and Trade Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed relevant commercial departments to focus on the operation of small commodities. The Municipal First Commercial Bureau and relevant procurement and supply stations have successively organized specialized forces, with the support of industrial and handicraft units, to vigorously organize sources of goods and increase market supply.
    Commercial departments have already allocated a batch of hardware materials, wood, moso bamboo, etc., to factories to produce urgently needed small commodities such as hairpins, shoe nails, zippers, rice washing baskets, scrubbing brushes, pot brushes, and bamboo chopsticks. For some small commodities whose raw materials need to be supplied from other places, commercial departments send people to the producing areas to purchase them. The planned supply of steel wire hairpins in January is more than 10.05 million, which is more than half of the supply in the three months of the third quarter of last year. The supply on the market is gradually increasing.
    Many small commodities are suitable for production with scattered old materials. Shanghai's commercial departments send people to collect scraps and broken materials everywhere. They have recently purchased a lot of scattered iron sheets, zinc sheets, and waste aluminum from enamel, flashlight, clock factories, and waste product companies, and supplied them to relevant factories to manufacture a large number of shoe eyelets, snap fasteners, sheet metal locks, and zippers. Commercial departments also actively assist factories in carrying out the substitution of metal raw materials. The lock heads and lock plates of drawer locks were originally made of aluminum alloy and sheet metal, but now they are replaced by bakelite and adhesive cloth respectively, with almost the same quality. As a result, factories can produce them in large quantities. The plan is to manufacture 7,000 dozen of these locks in the first quarter.
    Through the coordinated arrangement of industrial and commercial departments, the production capacity of small commodities has recently increased. A factory that manufactures lighters has recently allocated part of its production capacity to manufacture razor blades for people's shaving. It can produce 600,000 blades in the first quarter. Due to the increased demand for bakelite buttons in the market, two factories that produce both bakelite buttons and bakelite electrical materials are concentrating their efforts on manufacturing buttons. The output of buttons in the first quarter will increase by half compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The four women's goods stores in Shanghai's main small commodity market—the Old City God Temple—have recently strengthened contacts with some small commodity factories and workshops, adding more than 100 kinds of commodities, which are very popular among customers.
    Shanghai's commercial departments also actively assist factories in designing new styles of small commodities. Eighteen of the twenty new plastic hairpins in the shapes of butterflies, peonies, and small flower baskets have already been launched on the market. Small mirrors with frames made of red, pink, goose yellow, and orange yellow plexiglass are being rushed to be produced and will be available before the Spring Festival. These mirrors are exquisite, beautiful, and easy to carry. (Ye Shitao)

    供应人民生活多种多样的需要
   上海抓紧增产小商品
    本报上海12日电　上海商业部门在抓大商品采购供应工作的同时，积极组织小商品的生产和供应，尽力满足人民生活上多种多样的需要。
    小百货、小五金和各种各样竹木制的家庭用具统称小商品，是人们生活上普遍需要的东西。中共上海市委财政贸易工作部最近指示有关商业部门抓好小商品的经营。市第一商业局和有关采购供应站先后组织了专门力量，在工业和手工业单位支持下大力组织货源，增加市场供应。
    商业部门已经拨出一批五金材料、木材、毛竹等，供给工厂生产市场急需的发夹、鞋钉、拉链、淘米箩、板刷、洗锅帚、竹筷等小商品。有些小商品的原料需要外地供应，商业部门便派人去产地采购。一月份计划供应钢丝发夹一千零五十多万只，比去年第三季度三个月的供应量还多一半。现在市场上的供应量正在逐步增加。
    许多小商品适合用零星旧料生产，上海商业部门派人四出收集零料、碎料。他们最近从搪瓷、电筒。制钟工厂和废品公司收购了不少零星的铁皮、锌皮和废铝，供给有关工厂造出大批鞋眼、揿钮、铁皮锁和拉链。商业部门还积极协助工厂开展金属原料的代用工作。抽屉锁的锁头和锁板原来用铝合金和铁皮制造，现在分别以胶木和胶布代替，质量差不多。工厂因此可以大量生产。第一季度计划制造这种锁七千打。
    经过工商部门协同安排，最近小商品的生产能力有了增加。一家制造打火机的工厂，不久以前划出部分生产能力来制造人们剃须用的刀片。第一季度就可生产六十万片、由于市场上胶木钮扣的需要量增加，两家既产胶木钮扣又产胶木电料的工厂已在集中力量制造钮扣。第一季度的钮扣产量将比去年第四季度上升一半。上海主要的小商品市场——老城隍庙里的四家妇女用品商店，最近同一些小商品工厂和作坊加强联系，增加了一百多种商品，很受顾客欢迎。
    上海商业部门还积极协助工厂设计新花色的小商品。蝴蝶、牡丹花、小花篮等形状的二十种新塑料发夹已经有十八种上市。用大红、粉红、鹅黄、橙黄颜色有机玻璃配制镜框的小镜子正在加紧赶制，春节前夕就可供应。这种镜子玲珑美观，便于随身携带。　（叶世涛）
