    Rectification and Production in Communes
    Su Yi
    With the footsteps of spring drawing nearer, a production upsurge to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959 is now in full swing across the vast fields of our motherland. At the same time, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the movement to comprehensively rectify, consolidate, and improve the people's communes is also gradually unfolding from points to areas under the personal leadership of the First Secretaries of the local Party committees. Some people may ask: Which should be the focus, production or rectification? These should not be set against each other. It can be said that both are the focus; it can also be said that there is only one focus. Because the two are closely related and dialectically unified. A fundamental purpose of rectifying the communes is to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural and industrial production in 1959. And by arranging production well and carrying out rectification around production, we can both consolidate and improve the communes and promote production at the same time. Many places have already done this. The Shuguang People's Commune in Yuci, Shanxi, published in today's newspaper is a very good example. Because this commune has achieved a combination of the two, a new situation of mutual combination and mutual promotion of rectification and production has emerged. The first step in the rectification of communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou is also closely linked to production, and good results have been achieved.
    Why must the rectification of communes be closely combined with production? This is because developing production is the central link in consolidating and improving the people's communes. At present, a series of production tasks such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and production, field management, and winter sideline production are very heavy. Whether these tasks are done well or not is extremely important for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Doing these tasks well will lay a good foundation for the leap forward throughout the year and can increase the income of the communes and commune members, further improve their lives, and thus consolidate and improve the people's communes. Similarly, we cannot only focus on production and not on rectification. In order to do a good job in production, we must raise the consciousness of commune members, clarify the production policy, correctly handle a series of new issues such as distribution, improve living welfare, management, and organizational leadership, and we must do a good job in rectification.
    To closely combine rectification with current production, and to make rectification a driving force for promoting current production, the most important thing is that the guiding ideology must be clear. In every step of the rectification, we must firmly grasp the principle of combining production and rectification, first solve the most urgent problems related to current production, and propose clear production tasks based on the specific situation, so that production rises with each step of the rectification. According to the characteristics of managing diverse production and laboring in multiple places, the Shuguang People's Commune adopted the method of rectifying wherever labor is performed, allowing cadres to go deep into the labor sites and take charge of production and rectification on various production fronts. This approach is correct, which can fully mobilize the masses, so that the problems in rectification can be solved in a timely manner, and vigorously promote the emergence of a production upsurge. Now the rectification work in various places is being further developed. The methods and approaches of rectification can be diverse, but strictly following the spirit of the Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" and carrying out rectification closely in combination with production tasks is a fundamental principle.

    整社和生产
    苏宜
    随着春天的脚步声的日益临近，目前农村中，一场争取1959年更大跃进的生产高潮，正在祖国的辽阔原野上如火如荼地进行着。同时，根据中央的指示，全面地整顿、巩固和提高人民公社的运动，也在各地党委第一书记的亲自领导下，由点到面，逐步展开。有人会问：生产和整社，究竟以哪个为中心呢？这不能对立起来。可以说，两个都是中心；也可以说，就是一个中心。因为两者本是密切相关、辩证地统一起来的。整社的一个根本目的，就是为了保证1959年农业工业生产的更大跃进。而把生产安排好，围绕着生产进行整社，就能既把公社巩固和提高，同时也推动了生产。许多地方都已经这样做了。今天本报发表的山西榆次曙光人民公社就是个很好的例证。由于这个公社作到了两者的结合，已经出现了整社和生产互相结合、互相促进的新局面。杭州郊区开展整社的第一步，也紧密地结合生产进行，收到了很好的效果。
    整社为什么必须与生产紧密结合呢？这是因为发展生产是巩固和提高人民公社的中心环节。目前，兴修水利，积肥造肥，田间管理，以及冬季副业生产等一系列的生产任务十分繁重。这些工作做得好坏，对于能否实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进关系极大。把这些工作做好了，就能为全年的跃进打下一个好的基础，并能使公社和社员的收入增加，生活进一步改善，从而巩固和提高人民公社。同样，也不能只抓生产而不抓整社。为了把生产搞好，就必须提高社员的觉悟、明确生产的方针，正确处理分配、搞好生活福利、经营管理和组织领导等一系列的新问题，就必须做好整社工作。
    要使整社和当前生产密切结合，使整社成为促进当前生产的动力，最主要的是指导思想必须明确。在整社的每一步工作中，都要紧紧掌握住生产和整社结合的原则，首先解决关系当前生产最迫切的问题，根据具体的情况提出明确的生产任务，使生产随整社而着着上涨。曙光人民公社根据经营多种生产、劳动力在多处生产的特点，采取了在哪里劳动，就在哪里整社的方法，让干部深入劳动现场，分头掌握各个生产战线上的生产和整社工作。这种作法是正确的，既能充分发动群众，使整社中的问题及时得到解决，又有力地推动了生产高潮的出现。现在各地的整社工作正在进一步展开，整社的方式和方法可以是多种多样的，但是，严格按照中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的精神，紧密结合生产任务进行整社工作，却是一个根本的原则。
