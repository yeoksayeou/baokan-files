Fertilizer sources are everywhere; everyone joins hands;
　　Combining indigenous and foreign methods to produce bacterial fertilizer

    The Santunying People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, while vigorously promoting the manure accumulation campaign, is also using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture bacterial fertilizer. This commune has established a bacterial fertilizer general factory, and five brigades have established branch factories to produce bacterial fertilizer in large quantities.

    In order to strive for large-scale bumper harvests in 1959, the staff of the Santunying Bacterial Fertilizer General Factory and the Fang'anzhai Branch Factory are working hard despite the severe cold. At the beginning of January, strong winds blew for several days in a row, and the temperature dropped sharply. It is necessary to maintain a certain temperature indoors, otherwise the bacteria for making fertilizer will be difficult to reproduce. Under the leadership of Zhao Chunjing, the head of the technical team, the staff fought against the severe cold day and night. They tried their best to maintain and increase the indoor temperature to ensure the normal production of bacterial fertilizer.

    The entire process of making bacterial fertilizer does not require complicated equipment or instruments. They only use a simple kang (heated brick bed) and an earthen stove to keep the temperature in the room between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius. The production of bacterial powder mother liquor is done with a simple sterile inoculation box and an earthen-made incubator (heated with a kerosene lamp). The bacterial powder mother liquor they produced is the same as the one cultivated by the Changli Fruit Tree Research Institute of Hebei. At present, these two factories have produced more than 54,400 jin of antagonistic bacterial fertilizer, more than 4,400 jin of earthen mother liquor, and 140 tubes (test tubes) of bacterial powder mother liquor. Now these two factories have prepared more than 325,000 jin of materials and are carrying out production in full swing. (Gao Cuizhang et al.)

    肥源处处有　人人齐动手
    土洋结合　制造菌肥
    河北遵化县三屯营人民公社，在大搞积肥运动的同时，又用土洋结合的方法制造菌剂肥料。这个公社建立了一个菌肥总厂，五个大队都建立了分厂，大量生产菌肥。
    为了争取1959年的大面积丰产，三屯营菌肥总厂和方案寨分厂的职工们，冒着严寒紧张劳动。1月初，接连刮了几天大风，气温骤降。必须保持室内有一定的温度，不然造肥的菌就很难繁殖。职工们在技术组长赵春井的带动下，日夜跟严寒作斗争。他们尽力保持和加高室内温度，保证菌肥生产正常进行。
    整个菌肥制作，并没有什么复杂的设备和仪器。他们仅用简单的炕和一个土炉，使屋子里的温度保持在摄氏二十五度到三十度。菌粉母剂的制作，是用一个简单的无菌接种箱和一个土制的保温箱（用煤油灯加温）。他们制出的菌粉母剂，同河北昌黎果树研究所培育出来的一个样。目前，这两个厂已生产出抗生菌肥料五万四千四百多斤，生产土母剂四千四百多斤，菌粉母剂一百四十管（试管）。现在这两个厂已备料三十二万五千多斤，正在紧张地进行生产。（高翠章等）
