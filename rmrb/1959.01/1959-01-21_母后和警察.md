    The Queen Mother and the Police
    The British colonial authorities in Kenya recently announced a ban on public gatherings by Africans. According to British colonial official Wilkinson, the reason for issuing this ban is that the British Queen Mother Elizabeth will be "visiting" Kenya in February, and the police are busy conducting "exercises" in preparation for the Queen Mother's "visit," and have no time to "monitor" African gatherings, which "will inevitably cause riots."
    Needless to say, the Queen Mother's personal visit is to promote the British Empire's enlightened "benevolent rule" over the colonies. In preparation for the Queen Mother's arrival, the British colonial authorities in Kenya began police-escorted "exercises" a month in advance, and used this as an excuse to ban public gatherings of Africans. The Queen Mother's visit requires a large number of police escorts, and the people's gatherings require a large number of police to "monitor" them. Nothing could better illustrate the British Empire's "benevolent rule" over the colonies. Therefore, the Queen Mother's arduous overseas visit is really superfluous.

    母后和警察
    怯尼亚的英国殖民当局最近宣布不准非洲人举行公开集会。据英国殖民官员威金逊说，所以发布这一禁令，是因为英国伊丽莎白母后2月间将“访问”怯尼亚，警察正在忙于为母后的“访问”进行“演习”，无暇“监视”非洲人的集会，而这种集会“必然会引起骚乱”。
    不用说，母后御驾亲访是为了宣扬大英帝国对殖民地开明的“德政”的。怯尼亚的英国殖民当局为了母后的莅临，早一个月就进行警察开路喝道的“演习”，而且借此为名，下令禁止非洲人公开集会。母后出访需要大批警察护驾，人民集会需要大批警察“监视”，这比什么都更能说明大英帝国对殖民地的“德政”了。因此母后不辞劳苦远访海外实在是多此一举。
