Striving for Perfection
    Yi Huai

    The Jinxian County Committee of Jiangxi Province recently summarized their experience in making their work more meticulous during the Great Leap Forward. This is a very important matter. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Party specifically pointed out to us that our work must become more and more meticulous. The so-called meticulousness is nothing more than requiring our work to become closer and closer to reality or in line with reality, and more and more adapted to the laws of development of objective things.

    Things each have their own special circumstances and different laws of development. But there is a common development trend, which is: from simple to complex, from rough to meticulous, from low-level to high-level. Production is like this, and life is the same. For example, the People's Commune, compared to the original agricultural producers' cooperative, is more advanced and more progressive. Precisely because of this, it is much more complex than the agricultural cooperative. Another example is the collectivization of life. At first glance, it seems to be simplifying complex things, but it is not. The collectivization of life not only liberates women's labor, enabling them to participate in social labor and various political and cultural activities, and making their lives move from simple and boring to rich and colorful. Even things like eating, dressing, and taking care of children themselves will become more complex and diverse than before collectivization. Since things are becoming more and more complex, our work must become more and more meticulous. Leading an agricultural cooperative is more complex than leading a mutual aid group, and leading a commune is more complex than leading an agricultural cooperative. With the development of production, the work of leading production needs to be more meticulous, and when the responsibility of organizing the lives of the masses is also on our shoulders, the work must be even more meticulous. If this is not very clear, and one attempts to simplify things, then one will inevitably run into snags.

    The actual situation of things is always more complex than people originally imagined or recorded in books, and it is constantly developing and changing. To work meticulously, to approach or conform to objective reality, we must, as the Party Central Committee teaches us, combine soaring enthusiasm with meticulous investigation and research, and calm scientific analysis. The Jinxian County Committee did this very well. For the Great Leap Forward, the masses demanded that the branches of Poyang Lake be blocked. This is the revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring energy of the masses, and leaders cannot ignore it. However, whether the damming project can be carried out and how to dam it in accordance with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results cannot be solved by enthusiasm and energy alone. If the county party secretary had not conducted such meticulous investigation and research, the damming project would not have proceeded so smoothly, and it might have resulted in waste or even failure of the project and dampened the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.

    Investigation and research and scientific analysis should not only be fully carried out before starting to do something; they should also be continuously carried out after the work has begun. People's understanding of things is always constantly enriched and constantly approaching reality in practice, and it can never be accomplished once and for all. Some things, at first contact, may seem not too complicated; later, the more you come into contact with them, the deeper you get, the more you will see the ins and outs of this thing, its various aspects, and the complex relationships between them. Only by recognizing these can we make our work more and more meticulous. For example, the matter of students living in school. At the beginning, people will imagine it relatively simply, thinking that as long as students have houses to live in, beds to sleep on, and canteens to eat in, that's enough. After the students move into the school, they will find that the problem is not so simple. For example, it is necessary to arrange various after-school activities for students, to care about students' health, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and to have someone help students sew and wash clothes so that they can live better... In this way, the original plan must be supplemented and changed, and the work will become more in-depth and meticulous. It is worth noting here that we should not be afraid to revise and change the original plan, but should try to listen to the opinions of the masses as much as possible, study the actual situation more, and take the initiative to revise and supplement the existing plan. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "It is rare for people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be realized without any changes." This change is precisely what is necessary to make our work more meticulous and closer to reality.

    江西进贤县委最近总结了他们在大跃进中工作越做越细致的经验。这是一件很重要的事情。党的六中全会特别向我们指出，工作一定要越做越细致。所谓细致，不是别的，就是要求我们的工作越来越接近实际或符合实际，越来越和客观事物的发展规律相适应。
    事物各有自己的特殊情况和不同的发展规律。但有一个共同的发展趋势，就是：由简单到复杂、由粗糙到细致，由低级到高级。生产如此，生活也同样如此。比如人民公社，比起原来的农业生产合作社，它是更高级的，更进步的，正因此，它也就比农业社复杂得多。又如生活的集体化，乍一看，这似乎是把复杂的事情变简单化了，其实不然。生活集体化，不仅解放了妇女劳动力，使她们能够参加社会劳动和各种政治文化活动，使她们的生活由简单枯燥走向丰富多彩。就是吃饭、穿衣、带孩子这些事情本身，同样也要比集体化以前变得复杂多样。事情既是这样越来越复杂，我们的工作就必须越做越细致。领导农业社比领导互助组复杂，领导公社比领导农业社更复杂；随着生产的发展，领导生产的工作需要越做越细致，而当组织群众生活的责任也担在我们的肩膀上的时候，工作就得更加细致。对这一点如果不十分明确，而企图把事情简单化，那就不可避免地要碰钉子。
    事物的实际情况总是比人们原来所设想的或书本上所记录的要复杂得多，而且又在不断发展变化。要工作得细致，接近或符合客观情况，就必须像党中央所教导我们的，把冲天的干劲和细致的调查研究，冷静的科学分析结合起来。这一点，进贤县委做得很好。为了大跃进，群众要求堵死鄱阳湖汊口。这是群众的革命热情和冲天干劲，领导不可忽视。可是，堵口的工程究竟能不能搞，怎样堵才符合多快好省的原则，这就不是单靠干劲和热情所能解决的了。如果县委书记不那样细致地调查研究，堵口工程就不会进行得那样顺利，就可能发生浪费甚至使工程失败而挫伤群众的革命热情。
    调查研究和科学分析工作，不仅在动手办一件事情之前要充分进行；在工作开始之后仍然要不断进行。人们对事物的认识，总是在实践中不断丰富不断接近实际的，决不可能一劳永逸。有些事情，刚一接触，似乎还不太复杂；以后，越接触得多，越接触得深，就越会看到这一事物的来龙去脉、各个侧面以及他们相互之间的复杂关系。认识了这些，才有可能使我们的工作越做越细致。比如学生住校这件事，刚一开始，人们会设想得比较简单，以为只要使学生有房子住、有床铺睡、有食堂吃饭就可以了。及至学生住进学校以后，就会发现问题并不那么简单，比如要安排学生课余的各种活动、要关心学生的健康、要防止传染病的流行、要有人帮助学生缝缝洗洗，使他们生活得更好……。这样，原来的计划就要有所补充和变动，工作也就随之更加深入细致。在这里值得注意的是，不要害怕修改和变动原来的计划，而要尽可能地多倾听群众意见，多研究实际情况，主动地去修改和补充已有的计划。毛泽东同志教导我们：“人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。”这种变化，正是促使我们的工作更细致、更接近实际所必不可少的。
