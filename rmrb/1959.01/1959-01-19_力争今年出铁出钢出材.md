Comrade Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, with the support of the whole country and the help of the Soviet Union, the construction of Baogang (Baotou Steel) has laid a certain foundation through the efforts of all employees over the past few years. Last year, Baogang employees victoriously carried out the all-people rectification movement and the education of the Party's general line for socialist construction, thereby breaking superstitions, daring to think and act, and putting forward the bold oath of "halving investment, doubling output, completing an eight-year plan in five years." They launched mass movements among the masses, promoted the working methods of "one handover, four major tasks, two participations, one reform, and three combinations," and extensively carried out technological innovations and rapid construction, thereby creating many miracles and accumulating rich experience.

This year, Baogang's construction has entered a decisive and intense stage. On the one hand, large-scale industrial construction must be carried out, and on the other hand, it must blossom and bear fruit, producing a considerable amount of steel, iron, and steel materials. This is a great encouragement to the people of the whole country, especially to the Party organizations and people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. People will soon witness with their own eyes that Baogang, such a modern and large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise, will be combined with Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel to form the backbone system of China's iron and steel industry, greatly improving China's level of industrialization. People will see with their own eyes that the gradual growth of Baogang will drive the construction of all aspects of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to move forward at an accelerated pace and enable the working class of minority nationalities to grow rapidly and participate in the construction of the motherland. Looking to the future, they are extremely excited. "Go all out to support Baogang's construction" has become the unanimous call of the people of the entire Inner Mongolia region. Recently, the Ninth Plenary Committee convened by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, when studying the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, proposed to develop the iron and steel industry's production and construction centered on Baogang in terms of industrial production, and specifically made a decision on strengthening the leadership and support work for Baogang's construction. This decision will further mobilize the vast number of cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the region to more powerfully promote the accelerated construction of Baogang and its early commissioning. The Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Baotou City, and the employees of Baogang resolutely implement the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the decisions of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, step up the construction of Baogang, ensure the completion of this year's construction tasks, and ensure that Baogang contributes the greatest strength to the country's production task of 18 million tons of steel.

Baogang's construction tasks this year are extremely arduous. The amount of work to be completed in basic construction alone is more than twice that of last year, equivalent to 300% of Baogang's total investment during the first five-year plan. More than 20 major engineering projects with high technical requirements must be built and put into production. The largest iron ore mines, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, coke ovens, and rolling mills in our country that are being and will be built must produce a large number of products this year. In order to complete the above tasks, a series of measures must be taken in the internal management work and political and ideological work of the enterprise, continuing to adhere to putting politics in command, strengthening the leadership of the Party, and carrying out mass movements to meet the needs of new tasks. However, the construction of such a modern large enterprise cannot be completely solved by the enterprise itself. Baogang is located in Baotou City in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. From the perspective of mineral resources and transportation conditions, it is indeed an ideal iron and steel industrial base. However, the original industrial base of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is very weak, and it cannot but rely more on the support of the whole country. In fact, the support from many places across the country to Baogang in the past few years has been enormous, and the achievements Baogang has made so far are inseparable from this support. Therefore, the more Baogang's construction enters a critical juncture, the more problems need to be solved with the help of various places, especially in the seven aspects of equipment manufacturing, building materials and production materials, transportation capacity, technical personnel, labor force, and off-site engineering collaboration (such as electricity, railways, etc.) The problems are even more prominent. There are many problems that the enterprise itself, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Baotou City cannot completely solve, and some are completely unsolvable. We raise these problems not to emphasize difficulties and be intimidated by difficulties, nor to relax our efforts to overcome difficulties through self-reliance. We must, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent instructions to despise difficulties strategically, unswervingly fight against difficulties, and at the same time, we must pay attention to difficulties tactically, earnestly and practically solve problems, and complete the arduous task of building Baogang.

According to our personal experience over the past few years, it is unimaginable to build such a large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise without the support of the whole country. The support of the whole country for key construction is the decisive condition for Baogang to accelerate its progress. Last year, all aspects of the country had greater leaps forward, and the strength of various places has become more robust than before, and the strength to support this emerging new enterprise has also been strengthened. We sincerely thank all fraternal regions across the country for their past support to Baogang, and earnestly hope that they will give Baogang even greater support in the future!

    力争今年出铁出钢出材
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记
    中共包头市委第一书记  苏谦益
    包钢的建设工作在党中央的正确领导、全国各地的支援和苏联的帮助下，经过了全体职工几年来的努力，已经奠定了一定的基础。去年，包钢职工胜利地进行了全民整风运动和党的社会主义建设总路线的教育，因而破除迷信，敢想敢干，提出了“投资省一半、产量加一番、八年计划、五年完成”的豪迈誓言；在群众中大搞群众运动，推行一交四大两参一改三结合的工作方法，广泛开展技术革新与快速施工，从而创造了不少的奇迹，积累了丰富的经验。
    今年，包钢建设已进入有决定性的紧张阶段了。一方面要进行大规模的工业建设，一方面要开花结果，生产出相当数量的钢、铁和钢材。这对全国人民特别对内蒙古自治区的党组织和各族人民是一个很大的激励。人们就要亲眼看到包钢这样一个现代化的规模巨大的钢铁联合企业，将同鞍钢、武钢结合一起形成为祖国钢铁工业的骨干体系，大大提高我国的工业化水平。人们就要亲眼看到包钢的逐步成长带动了内蒙古自治区的各方面的建设加快速度向前迈进。并使少数民族工人阶级迅速壮大起来，参加祖国的建设。瞻望将来，无比兴奋。“全力以赴，支援包钢建设”，成为内蒙古全区人民不约而同的呼声。最近内蒙古党委所召开的第九次全体委员会，研究贯彻执行党的八届六中全会的决议时，在工业生产方面提出发展以包钢为中心的钢铁工业生产建设，并且专门做出了关于加强包钢建设的领导和支援工作的决定。这一决定将进一步动员全区广大干部和各族人民更有力地促成包钢加速建设和及早投入生产。中共包头市委、包头市的各族人民和包钢的职工坚决地执行党的八届六中全会的决议和内蒙古党委的决定，加紧包钢的建设，保证完成今年的施工任务，保证包钢在国家一千八百万吨钢的生产任务中，贡献出最大的力量。
    包钢今年的建设任务是异常艰巨的。仅仅基本建设方面要完成的工程量为去年的二倍以上，相当于第一个五年计划期间包钢总投资的300％，二十多个技术要求很高的重大工程项目要兴建与投入生产。正在和即将兴建的我国最大的铁矿山、高炉、平炉、焦炉和轧材厂，在今年都要生产大量的产品。为了完成上述任务，在企业内部的管理工作和政治思想工作方面必须采取一系列的措施，继续坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，开展群众运动，以适应新的任务的需要。但是，建设这样一个现代化大企业，决不是企业本身能完全解决的。包钢建设在内蒙古自治区西部的包头市，从矿藏资源、运输条件等方面来看，确实是很理想的钢铁工业基地。但内蒙古自治区原来的工业基础很薄弱，不能不更多的依靠全国各地的支援。事实上，几年来全国许多地方对包钢的支援是巨大的，包钢到现在所取得的成就，是与这些支援分不开的。所以包钢的建设越是进入紧要关头，需要各地帮助解决的问题也愈多，特别是在设备制造、建筑材料和生产材料、运输力量、技术人员、劳动力、厂外工程协作（如电力、铁路等等）七个方面的问题更显得突出。有许多问题是企业本身、内蒙古自治区和包头市不能完全解决的，有些则是完全不能解决的。我们提出这些问题，并不是强调困难，为困难所吓倒，也不是为了放松自力更生克服困难的努力，我们要本着毛泽东同志历来所指示的在战略上要藐视困难的指示，坚定不移地与困难作斗争，同时也要在战术上重视困难、认真切实地去解决问题，完成建设包钢的艰巨任务。
    根据我们几年以来亲身体验，建设这样规模巨大的钢铁联合企业，没有全国的支援是不可想像的。全国各地对重点建设的支援，乃是包钢加快前进的决定条件。去年全国各地各方面事业都有更大的跃进，各地力量都已经比以前更为雄厚了，支援这一后起的新企业的力量也加强了。我们诚恳地感谢全国各兄弟地区过去对包钢的支援，并且殷切地希望今后还要给包钢以更大的支援！
