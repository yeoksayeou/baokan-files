    The People's Commune surges like a tide, frightening the stupid hearts of the West. The bloody, stinking Dulles, helplessly begs for the way of Confucius. He puts on a swallowtail coat, and vaguely, dimly arrives at Qufu. After kowtowing three times and prostrating nine times, he bursts into tears upon seeing the sacred throne: "Everyone says the People's Commune is good, but I think the People's Commune is terrible. The children are sent to nurseries, and the women are also engaged in production. They don't worry about oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, and once the virtue and way of women are abandoned, the character '天' (heaven) protrudes, with the husband as the master. How can heaven and earth allow it to be turned upside down? The old morality of the Three Cardinal Guides and the Five Constant Virtues is really wonderful. I still ask you, Confucius, to lend a helping hand to uphold justice!" Confucius smiled after hearing this: "I, Qiu, am rotten wood that cannot be carved. Mr. Dulles sincerely worships at the gate of Confucius, why not practice the ways of Confucius and Mencius yourself? The elders of your country told me, pacing in the park, feeling frustrated, even if there are millions of rich children and grandchildren, accumulating grain to raise children is unreliable. The women of your country uphold female virtue, but raising children is difficult to achieve satisfaction. They want to imitate Nora and leave the boudoir, but they don't know where to find a career. Looking back at our great commune, men and women receive equal pay for equal work. Women don't revolve around the stove, and the old and young are reunited in joy. The little babies in the nursery are better cared for than at home. When they are old, they don't worry about having no children, and they move into new homes called 'Respect for the Elderly'. I cherish my young and cherish the young of others, I care for my old and care for the old of others. Everyone calls me old feudalism, but I also laugh at this scene!" Coming with great interest and returning disappointed, the fool scratches his head in anger. He also hits a wall in front of Confucius, which is really unexpected.

    杜勒斯夜哭孔庙
    枚屋人民公社势如潮，西方蠢人心神跳，血腥铜臭杜勒斯，无奈乞求孔圣道，穿上一身燕尾服，渺渺茫茫曲阜到，三跪九叩行礼毕，一见神座哭嚎啕：“都说人民公社好，我看人民公社糟，娃娃送进托儿所，娘们也把生产搞，油盐酱醋不操心，妇德妇道一旦抛，天字出头夫作主，乾坤岂容来颠倒？三纲五常旧道德，实在好得不得了，还是请你孔圣人，鼎助一臂持公道！”孔子听毕莞尔笑：“丘乃朽木不可雕，杜君心诚拜孔门，何不自行孔孟道？贵邦老人对我言，徘徊公园心懊恼，纵有儿孙百万翁，积谷养儿两无靠；贵邦女子守妇道，哺儿育女难求饱，欲效娜拉出闺房，不知职业何处找？回看我国大公社，男女同工同酬劳，妇女不围三台转，老少团聚乐逍遥，托儿所里小宝宝，要比家里带得好，老来不愁无儿女，迁进新居名敬老，幼我幼及人之幼，老我老及人之老，人人称我老封建，我见此境也欢笑！”乘兴而来败兴归，蠢人气得把头搔，孔子面前也碰壁，真是做梦想不到。
