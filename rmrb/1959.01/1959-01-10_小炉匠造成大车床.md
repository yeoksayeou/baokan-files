    Small Blacksmith Creates Large Lathe
    In the agricultural implement repair shop of Bachalu Township, Guantao County, Shandong Province, there is a small blacksmith named Zhang Cuichang, who recently made an eight-foot belt lathe. This matter quickly spread throughout the county.
    The equipment in the Bachalu Township agricultural implement repair shop is very poor, with only a few furnaces and hammers. After Zhang Cuichang heard the township Party committee secretary's transmission regarding vigorously launching the technical revolution movement, he resolved to make a lathe himself. He drew a rough sketch according to the belt lathe used in the county's seed cotton processing plant, had a carpenter help make a model, and began manufacturing. Since there was no electric welding for making the bed surface, he used hand files to make seven mandrel threads to connect the I-beams together. After the bed surface was made, he used inch steel to forge a small hand planer and planed the bed surface little by little. After more than a month of hard work, he finally made an eight-foot belt lathe. This lathe can produce various machine parts with a diameter of fifty centimeters and a length of two hundred centimeters. The agricultural implement repair shop used this lathe to produce a large number of bearings, providing conditions for the bearingization of the entire township.

    小炉匠造成大车床
    山东省馆陶县八岔路乡农具修配厂，有个小炉匠叫张翠昌，他最近制成一台八尺皮带车床。这件事很快地在全县传开了。
    八岔路乡农具修配厂的设备很差，只有几盘炉和几把锤。张翠昌听了乡党委书记关于大力开展技术革命运动的传达后，决心自己动手制造车床。他按照县籽棉加工厂使用的皮带车床画了个草图，由木工帮助制成模型，就开始制造。造床面没有电焊，他就用手锉制成七个棒锤丝把工字铁连接在一起。床面做成后，又用寸钢锻打一个小手刨，一点一点地把床面刨光。经过一个多月苦干，终于制成了一台八尺皮带车床。这台车床能生产直径五十公分、长度二百公分的各种机件。农具修配厂利用这台车床生产出大批的轴承，为全乡的轴承化提供了条件。
