The realization of the people's communes has greatly promoted the development of social productive forces, resulting in profound changes in the social and spiritual outlook of the province. At present, an extremely important political task is to deeply study and publicize the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and to do a good job in rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. This is the key to determining whether industrial and agricultural production can achieve a greater leap forward this year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th - The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a four-level cadre meeting of provinces, prefectures, counties, and townships (communes) from December 17th to 30th, 1958, to convey and discuss the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong.
　　After summarizing the tremendous achievements made by various economic sectors in 1958, the meeting, in accordance with the national economic development indicators for 1959 adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, comprehensively arranged the national economic plan for Shandong Province in 1959 and the first quarter. According to this plan, industrial and agricultural production in Shandong Province in 1959 will double that of 1958. The meeting believed that in order to complete this task, it is necessary to continue to struggle against all kinds of right-leaning conservative thinking, so that people will always maintain high morale and soaring enthusiasm. In the industrial aspect, it is necessary to adopt the method of "walking on two legs" and rapidly develop leading sectors such as coal, electricity, and transportation. The steel production task in 1959 will mainly be completed by blast furnaces, converters, and open-hearth furnaces of three cubic meters or more, and six iron and steel bases; blast furnaces, indigenous furnaces, and indigenous steelmaking furnaces of less than three cubic meters will no longer be built, and the existing ones will be strengthened in management according to the requirements of factoryization, basing, and "five fixings." At the same time, it is necessary to seize the manufacture of rolling equipment and mining equipment to change the uncoordinated situation of weak ends and strong middle in production equipment. In agriculture, it is necessary to earnestly do a good job in wheat field management, apply 30,000 to 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of wheat field, and universally irrigate it once with frozen water. It is necessary to continue to do a good job in farmland water conservancy construction, ensure the realization of mechanized wells, complete the task of soil and water conservation, expand the irrigation area, and ensure that the 50 million mu of basic farmland meet the standard of having water whenever needed and having as much as needed. In order to rationally arrange labor and avoid labor shortages, the meeting determined that the earthwork and stonework of farmland water conservancy projects in winter and spring should be maintained at 15 billion cubic meters of earthwork and stonework in 1958, and should not exceed 20 billion cubic meters at most.
　　The meeting believed that rectifying and consolidating the people's communes is the most prominent central task in rural work in winter and spring, and is the basic guarantee for doing all work well. Party organizations at all levels must conduct rectification and consolidation work on the people's communes from January to April 1959 in close combination with the winter and spring production tasks, in accordance with the spirit and requirements of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.
　　The meeting also fully discussed the Central Committee's decision on improving the rural financial and trade management system. The meeting believed that "two releases, three unifications, and one package" is a unified whole, and there should be no one-sided understanding, and it must be resolutely released, resolutely unified, and well packaged. The meeting required all localities to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity among cadres and the masses to unify the understanding of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and ensure the correct implementation of the Central Committee's decision on this issue.

　　The meeting summarized the achievements and main experiences of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1958. Specific arrangements were made for production in the first quarter of 1959. In the industrial aspect, it is required to first ensure the development of steel production, for which equipment, coke, ore, refractory materials, building materials, and transportation should be correspondingly followed up, and other light industries should also be developed accordingly. In the agricultural aspect, it is required to vigorously develop cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production while focusing on grain production. At present, it is necessary to prominently focus on the winter production movement centered on deep plowing and water conservancy construction, and strive to complete the irrigation task of 15 million mu of paddy fields.

　　All three meetings discussed the current situation of the people's commune movement in the province in accordance with the spirit of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee.
　　The meeting believed that the central task of rural work at present is to closely combine with winter production to rectify and consolidate the people's communes.

    河南
    据新华社郑州7日电　中共河南省第一届代表大会第三次会议最近在郑州市举行。会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，总结了1958年全面大跃进的经验，部署了1959年特别是当前冬春两季的工作。会议认为，从1957年冬季全省第一届党代会第二次会议以来，全省在工农业生产、财贸、文教、卫生、科学等方面，都取得了很大成绩。今年必须充分运用1958年以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的成功经验，继续反对右倾保守思想，破除迷信，并且要深刻领会毛主席在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难的教导，贯彻执行党的总路线，实行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针和工农业同时并举等方针，争取更大的跃进。
    会议讨论了中共河南省委提出的1959年度河南省国民经济建设计划草案，这个草案最近已由省委提请河南省第二届人民代表大会第一次会议通过。
    会议认为，河南省人民公社化运动的发展是健康的。由于人民公社化的实现，大大促进了社会生产力的发展，使全省的社会面貌和精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。当前一项极为重要的政治任务是深入学习和宣传党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，做好整顿和巩固人民公社的工作。这是决定今年工农业生产能否更大跃进的关键。
    会议指出，整顿、巩固人民公社的主要内容是：广泛深入地进行社会主义和共产主义教育；以发展生产作为巩固提高人民公社的中心环节，坚持贯彻执行根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，使人民公社的工业和农、林、牧、副、渔业全面发展；作好分配工作；在发展生产的基础上，高度关心群众生活，办好集体福利事业；在经营管理上，要认真贯彻执行民主管理的原则和实行统一领导、分级管理的制度；还要加强县联社的领导，从各方面发挥县联社的作用；在生产管理上，要建立明确的生产责任制；要坚持群众路线，改进干部作风，加强党与群众的联系。保证人民公社的不断巩固和提高。

    会议在总结1958年各个经济部门所取得的巨大成就后，根据八届六中全会通过的1959年全国国民经济发展指标，全面安排了山东省1959年和第一季度国民经济计划。根据这个计划，山东省1959年的工农业生产都将比1958年翻一番。会议认为，为完成这一任务，必须继续同形形色色的右倾保守思想作斗争，使人们永远保持昂扬的斗志和冲天的干劲。在工业方面要采用两条腿走路的办法，迅速发展煤、电、交通等先行部门。1959年的钢铁生产任务，主要靠三立方公尺以上的高炉、转炉、平炉和六个钢铁基地完成；三立方公尺以下的高炉、土炉和土炼钢炉不再兴建，要根据工厂化、基地化和“五定”的要求，对原有的加强管理。同时要抓紧制造轧钢设备和采矿设备，改变生产设备上两头弱中间强的不协调局面。在农业方面，要切实做好麦田管理工作，每亩麦田要追肥三万到五万斤，并普遍浇一次冻水。要继续搞好农田水利建设，保证实现机井化，完成水土保持任务，扩大灌溉面积，保证五千万亩基本农田达到何时用水何时有，用多少有多少的标准。为了合理安排劳力，避免劳力紧张，会议确定，冬春季农田水利工程的土石方，以维持1958年的一百五十亿土石方为宜，最多不要超过二百亿。
    会议认为，整顿和巩固人民公社是冬春两季农村工作中的一项最突出的中心任务，是做好一切工作的基本保证。各级党组织必须按照八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的精神和要求，在1959年1月到4月，紧密结合冬春季生产任务，对人民公社进行一次整顿和巩固工作。
    会议依据中央关于改进农村财贸管理体制的决定也进行了充分的讨论。会议认为，“两放、三统、一包”是一个统一的整体，不能有任何片面的理解，必须坚决地放，必须坚决地统和很好地包。会议要求各地在干部群众中广泛、深入地展开宣传，使广大干部和群众统一认识，保证正确地贯彻执行中央关于这个问题的决定。
