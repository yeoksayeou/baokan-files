    "Striving for Freedom for Future Generations"
    -- Burns and His Poetry
    Allow me, generous heavens, to live long enough,
    To see the villains also feel the pain they inflict;
    To see everyone obtain precious freedom as easily as air,
    At that time, slaves and tyrants are merely historical names.
    Heavy oppression brings us pain and disaster!
    To prevent our descendants from enduring shackles and prisons again;
    We are willing to shed all our precious blood together,
    To strive for freedom for future generations!
    Knock the arrogant reactionaries to the ground!
    Kill all the tyrants one by one!
    With every punch, we extend freedom!
    Let us succeed or die!
    The above verses are all from the poems of the great Scottish folk poet Burns. Two hundred years ago today, a great poet was born in Scotland. He is Robert Burns, one of the world cultural figures commemorated this year by the World Peace Council. Robert Burns (1759-1796) was an 18th-century Scottish folk poet and a staunch democrat. He was the son of a tenant farmer and farmed himself. He worked on the land from the time he was able to operate it until he was sixteen years old, never leaving the life of a farmer. After he began writing poetry, he often walked in the fields holding the plow, silently writing verses in his heart or humming rhymes.
    Burns used his poems to call for freedom and the friendship of all peoples, satirize reactionary rulers, and praise the working people. His works almost everywhere reveal sighs and resentment of suffering and toil. His poems depict the life of the people, full of sincerity, optimistic humor, and embody his confidence in the infinite power of the people. His satirical poems, like whips, mercilessly lash the aristocratic parasites and the evils of the dark society, he shouted: In such a society, "all officials are but imprints of money."
    Burns was good at using the form of folk songs to write about contemporary life and the fiery thoughts and feelings of the people. Therefore, the Scottish people loved their own poet even more. During Burns's lifetime, every time a collection of poems was published, tenant farmers and maids often scrambled to buy them with their hard-earned money. At that time, in Scotland, Burns's collection of poems could be found in almost every farmer's cottage. Burns was one of Marx's favorite poets. Marx considered it a great pleasure to listen to his daughters recite Burns's satirical poems or sing the poet's love songs during his heavy workload.
    People's Literature Publishing House has decided to publish "Selected Poems of Burns" translated by Wang Zuoliang this year.

### “把自由争给后代”——彭斯和他的诗

    “把自由争给后代”
    ——彭斯和他的诗
    允许我，宽大的苍天，给我足够的年岁，
    让我活着看见，凶徒们也感到他们所给人的苦痛；
    看见人人得到宝贵的自由，像空气一样容易，
    那时候，奴隶和暴君只是历史上的名称。
    重重的压迫给我们痛苦，灾难！
    为了不让子孙再挨枷锁，牢监；
    我们愿把宝贵的鲜血一齐流干，
    把自由争给后代！
    把骄傲的反动者打倒地上！
    把暴君们一个个杀光！
    我们每一拳使自由伸张！
    让我们成功或是死亡！
    上面这几节诗，都是苏格兰的伟大的民间诗人彭斯的诗。二百年前的今天，在苏格兰诞生了一个伟大的诗人。他就是世界和平理事会决定今年纪念的世界文化名人之一罗伯特·彭斯。罗伯特·彭斯（1759—1796）是十八世纪苏格兰的民间诗人，坚决的民主主义者。他是一个佃农的儿子，自己也种过田。他从能够在田地上操作起，一直劳动到十六岁，没有离开过农民的生活。当他开始作诗以后，常常是一面握着犁把在田里走，一面在心里默写诗句，或是哼着韵脚。
    彭斯以自己的诗篇号召争取自由和各族人民的友爱，讥讽反动的统治者，颂扬劳动人民。他的作品几乎处处吐露着受苦操劳的叹息与愤懑。他的诗描写人民的生活，充满诚恳、乐观的幽默情调，并体现出自己对人民无穷力量的信心。他的讽刺诗，像鞭子一样，无情地鞭挞了贵族寄生虫和黑暗社会的罪恶，他大声疾呼：在这样的社会里，“一切官吏不过是金钱的印痕而已”。
    彭斯善于利用民歌的形式来写当代生活和人民火热的思想感情。因此苏格兰人民更加热爱他们自己的这位诗人。在彭斯生前，每一诗集出版，佃农和女佣们常把辛苦积下的钱来争先购买。当时，在苏格兰，几乎在每一农家茅屋里都能找到彭斯的诗集。彭斯是马克思所喜爱的诗人之一。马克思在繁重工作之暇，听自己的女儿们背诵彭斯的讽刺诗或咏唱诗人的情歌，认为是一件莫大的乐事。
    人民文学出版社决定在今年内出版王佐良译的“彭斯诗选”。
