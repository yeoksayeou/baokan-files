    Commune's Commodity Production Must Obey National Leadership

    Some comrades believe that since it is very necessary and important for people's communes to develop commodity production and commodity exchange, there is no danger, and it is beneficial to the country and the communes, then leadership can be relaxed, allowing it to develop freely and exchange casually. This understanding is also incorrect. Precisely because developing commodity production and commodity exchange is a strategic issue for the development of production in people's communes, and it plays an important role in accelerating socialist construction and consolidating and improving people's communes, it is even more necessary to strengthen leadership. We must both let go and keep a tight grip, so that it can develop under the leadership of the Party and the state in a planned way, and serve socialism and the needs of the people well.

    Strengthening ideological and political work among cadres and the masses is an important aspect of developing commodity production. At present, in terms of ideological understanding, in addition to some comrades still not fully recognizing the significance of developing commodity production and commodity exchange, and therefore not being bold and relaxed enough, as mentioned above, some comrades also believe that developing commodity production means producing casually and buying and selling freely, and that leadership and management can be relaxed. It must be emphasized that what we are engaged in is socialist commodity production, which must be carried out under the leadership of the state, based on social needs, strictly implementing state plans, conscientiously abiding by state market and price policies, and carrying out organized, led, and planned commodity exchange, serving both the needs of the commune and the needs of the country. This is precisely the fundamental difference from capitalist commodity production and a characteristic of socialist commodity production. If we deviate from this principle, it will be capitalist management thinking and style, which will cause market chaos, affect national plans and socialist construction, and also affect the production and consolidation of people's communes. This must be resolutely opposed.

    To develop commodity production well, a series of specific and in-depth organizational work and mass work must also be carried out. The four most important points are: First, each commune must formulate specific plans, including both long-term plans and short-term phased arrangements. Moreover, this plan must be incorporated into the national plan, starting from social needs and obeying state management; at the same time, it must also implement adapting to local conditions, giving full play to its own characteristics and initiative, in order to ensure that all commodity production that should and can be developed is developed, while preventing blindness. The second is to properly arrange labor and time, closely integrate with industrial and agricultural production, and organize professional teams of various sizes, with dedicated leadership, to ensure the realization of the commodity production plan. Third, the principle of obtaining materials locally and producing locally should be implemented, both to fully tap the potential of the commune's resources and not to force oneself to do things that one cannot do. Fourth, the issue of income distribution should be handled correctly, and reasonable distribution methods and systems should be formulated based on the principle of being conducive to production and conducive to the consolidation of the commune, in order to fully mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the masses and ensure the comprehensive and continuous development of commodity production.

### 公社的商品生产要服从国家领导

    公社的商品生产要服从国家领导
    有的同志认为，既然人民公社发展商品生产和商品交换是十分必要的和重要的，没有什么危险，而是对国家和公社有好处，那末就可放松领导，让它自由发展，随便交换就可以了。这种认识也是不对的。正因为发展商品生产和商品交换是人民公社发展生产的方针性问题，对加速社会主义建设和巩固提高人民公社有重要的作用，就更必须加强领导，既要放开手，又要抓得紧，才能使它在党和国家领导下有计划地发展，很好地为社会主义和人民需要服务。
    加强干部和群众的思想政治工作，是发展商品生产的重要环节。当前在思想认识方面，除了有些同志对发展商品生产和商品交换的重要意义仍认识不足，因而不够大胆和放手以外，正如上面所说，还有的同志认为发展商品生产就是随便生产，自由买卖，可以放松领导和管理。必须强调指出，我们搞的是社会主义商品生产，必须在国家领导下进行，根据社会需要办事，严格执行国家计划，认真遵守国家市场和物价政策，开展有组织、有领导、有计划的商品交换，既为本社需要服务，又为国家需要服务，这正是同资本主义商品生产的根本区别，正是社会主义商品生产的一个特点。如果脱离这个原则，就是资本主义经营思想和作风，会造成市场混乱，影响国家计划和社会主义建设，也影响人民公社的生产和人民公社的巩固。这是必须加以坚决反对的。
    要很好地发展商品生产，还必须进行一系列的具体而深入的组织工作和群众工作。这里最重要的有四点：一个是每个公社都要制订具体的规划，既要有长期规划，又要有短期分段安排。而且这种计划必须纳入国家计划，从社会需要出发，服从国家管理；同时也要贯彻因地制宜，充分发挥自己的特点和主动精神，以保证把应该和可以发展的商品生产都发展起来，而又防止盲目性。再一个是妥善安排劳动力和时间，和工农业生产紧密结合，组织各种规模大小不同的专业队，有专人领导，以保证商品生产计划的实现。第三应当贯彻执行就地取材、就地生产的原则，既要充分挖掘本社资源的潜力，又不要勉强作自己不能作到的事情。第四，要正确处理收益分配问题，根据有利于生产、有利于公社巩固的原则制订合理的分配办法和制度，以便充分发挥广大群众的劳动热情，保证商品生产全面地、不断地发展。
