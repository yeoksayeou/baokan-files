Anhui has built 800 blast furnaces of eight cubic meters or more last year, with steel production increasing more than 50 times, iron increasing more than four times, and steel quality has always been good.
    (By this newspaper) Anhui Province's iron and steel industry has achieved a great leap forward. According to the statistics of the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Headquarters as of December 31 last year, the province produced 129,411 tons of steel last year, completing 129.4% of the national plan of 100,000 tons; and produced 1,068,004 tons of iron, completing 103.7% of the national plan. Compared with 1957, steel production increased by 54.92 times, and iron increased by 4.09 times. The quality of steel and iron has also maintained a good level. In terms of capital construction, the province has already built and put into production 801 blast furnaces with a volume of 8 cubic meters or more, and construction is being stepped up. It is expected that another 300 will be completed soon. The total volume of these blast furnaces reaches 12,700 cubic meters. The province has built a total of 631 converters of various types, with a total annual production capacity of more than 580,000 tons.
    The great leap forward in Anhui Province's iron and steel industry is a victory for the Party's General Line and also a victory for the Party's mass line. In order to ensure a complete victory on the iron and steel front, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the deepening of the movement, has continuously and deeply studied and analyzed the contradictions in various aspects of the movement and the trend of the movement's development. Among them, it focused on studying the relationship between indigenous and foreign methods, the relationship between decentralization and concentration, the relationship between quantity and quality, the relationship between crash production and balanced production, the relationship between today and tomorrow, and the relationship between technology and politics.
    According to the policy of combining large, medium, and small scales, the province adopted the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the mainstay, emphasizing both quality and quantity, and rational layout" to actively develop the iron and steel industry. Due to the adoption of this policy, the mass movement for developing the iron and steel industry in Anhui Province last year had the following main characteristics:
    First, from the very beginning, the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the mainstay, was implemented. That is, on the one hand, in the vast rural areas, small indigenous furnaces and semi-indigenous and semi-foreign furnaces were built in places with experience in indigenous iron smelting and conditions for indigenous iron smelting. On the other hand, in major cities such as Hefei, Huainan, Wuhu, Bengbu, Ma'anshan, Tongling, and Anqing, where conditions such as machinery manufacturing, power supply, transportation, and technical strength are generally available, vigorous efforts were made to build small foreign groups. In the mass movement for iron and steel production, Anhui Province grasped both small indigenous furnaces and small foreign furnaces, combining indigenous and foreign methods. In particular, it overcame numerous difficulties and made the greatest efforts to build small foreign furnaces in places where conditions permitted. This not only played a significant role in completing last year's iron and steel production but, more importantly, laid a good foundation for the further development of the iron and steel industry in the future.
    Second, rational layout. Anhui Province's iron ore is mainly distributed along both banks of the Yangtze River, and coal is mainly distributed along both banks of the Huai River. There is a Huainan Railway from the Huai River to the Yangtze River. Based on these conditions, small foreign furnaces were built on a large scale in the "T"-shaped area formed by the Huainan Railway and the Yangtze River. By December last year, a new iron and steel base network had basically taken shape.
    Third, equal emphasis on quality and quantity. Because Anhui Province has always emphasized equal emphasis on quality and quantity, both the steel and iron produced by small indigenous furnaces and small foreign furnaces have ensured both quantity and quality. Due to attention to balanced production, output has been gradually increasing. The pig iron transferred out also met the standards stipulated by the state.
    Anhui Province's iron and steel production tasks last year have been successfully completed. Now, the province's iron and steel army is full of victorious joy and is making persistent efforts to fight for even greater iron and steel production tasks.

    安徽大搞“小洋群”
    去年建成八百座八立方公尺以上的高炉，钢产量增长五十多倍，铁增长四倍多，钢铁质量一直较好
    本报讯　安徽省钢铁工业获得飞跃发展。据省冶金工业指挥部到去年12月31日统计，全省去年共产钢十二万九千四百一十一吨，完成国家计划十万吨的129.4％；产铁一百零六万八千零四吨，完成国家计划的103.7％。和1957年比较，钢的产量增加五十四点九二倍，铁增加四点零九倍。钢铁的质量，也一直保持着较好的水平。在基本建设方面，全省已经建成和投入生产的八立方公尺以上的高炉已有八百零一座，正在加紧施工，预计不久可以建成的还有三百座。这些高炉的总容积共达一万二千七百立方公尺。全省已建成的各种类型的炼钢转炉共有六百三十一座，年生产能力共达五十八万多吨。
    安徽省钢铁工业的大跃进，是党的总路线的胜利，也是党的群众路线的胜利。为了保证钢铁战线获得全胜，中共安徽省委随着运动的深入发展，就不断深入地研究分析了运动各个方面的矛盾和运动发展的趋势，其中又着重研究了土与洋的关系，分散与集中的关系，数量与质量的关系，突击生产与均衡生产的关系，今天与明天的关系，技术与政治的关系。
    根据大中小并举的方针，采取了“土洋结合、以洋为主、质量并重、合理布局”的方针，积极发展钢铁工业。由于采取了这个方针，安徽省去年发展钢铁工业的群众运动，主要有如下几个特点：
    第一、一开始就贯彻了土洋结合、以洋为主的方针。这就是，一方面在广大农村中，有土法炼铁经验和土法炼铁条件的地方，就建立小土炉和半土半洋的炉子。另一方面，在机械制造、动力供应、交通运输、技术力量等条件大体具备的地方，例如合肥、淮南、芜湖、蚌埠、马鞍山、铜陵、安庆等主要城市，就大搞小洋群。安徽省在钢铁生产的群众运动中，既抓小土炉，又抓小洋炉，使土洋结合起来，特别是战胜了重重困难，以最大的努力在有条件的地方大搞小洋炉，这样就不仅对完成去年钢铁生产起了重大作用，更重要的是为将来进一步发展钢铁工业打下了很好的基础。
    第二、合理布局。安徽省的铁矿石主要分布在长江两岸，煤主要分布在淮河两岸，从淮河到长江有一条淮南铁路。根据这些条件，在淮南铁路和长江构成的“丁”字形地带，大建小洋炉，到去年12月份一个新的钢铁基地网已经基本形成。
    第三、质量并重。安徽省由于始终强调质量并重，不论是小土炉和小洋炉生产出来的钢铁，都是既保证了数量，又保证了质量。由于注意均衡生产，产量一直逐步上升。调出的生铁，也都合乎国家规定的标准。
    安徽省去年钢铁生产任务已经胜利完成了。现在，全省钢铁大军正满怀着胜利的喜悦，再接再厉，为迎接更大的钢铁生产任务而战斗。
