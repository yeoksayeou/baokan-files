Experiences in Using Sewage for Irrigation
    Gao Fang
    The Lishizhai Work Area of the Shangyou People's Commune in Fushun City, Liaoning Province, has achieved increased production year after year since 1952 by rationally utilizing urban sewage for irrigation. Last year, the 8,640 mu of rice paddies in the entire work area that were irrigated with sewage yielded an average of 1,350 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 2,800 jin. This work area has gained some experience in using industrial sewage for irrigation.

    Dilution
    Industrial sewage contains many harmful impurities, and sometimes the concentration is too high. Direct irrigation can easily burn crops. Local farmers have learned that diluting the sewage with a certain proportion of clean water before irrigating can achieve good results. Most of the sewage in Fushun City is discharged from the petroleum industry and contains harmful components such as phenols and oil. Irrigation tests have shown that the appropriate ratio of industrial sewage to clean water is between 1:4 and 3:7. A simple method to determine the appropriate ratio of sewage to clean water is to plant rice in several pots and irrigate them with different concentrations of sewage to find the right proportion. Where possible, relevant departments can be asked to conduct tests to determine the ratio.

    Dry Nursery, Shallow Water Transplanting
    According to the experience of the Lishizhai Work Area, dry nurseries must be used when using sewage for raising seedlings to avoid burning and damaging the seedlings. The method for dry nursery is to dig a small ditch, one chi wide and two to three cun deep, in the middle of a one to two meter wide nursery bed for irrigation. Then, spread ammonium sulfate on the seedling bed so that the soil and ammonium sulfate are fully mixed, then sow the seeds, and use a wooden roller to press the ground so that some of the seeds are in the soil and some are exposed. Then, cover the seeds with a three to four centimeter thick layer of sand (preferably river sand, because sand absorbs heat, is easy to drain, and blocks wind). If the seedling bed is dry and cracked, water it. When the seedlings are one cun tall, remove the sand and water with sewage. When irrigating with sewage, in addition to diluting it with river water, it must also be settled in a nursery bed or one or two empty pools for one day to reduce parasite eggs, settling suspended matter, and toxic substances in the sewage. After irrigating, sprinkle ammonium sulfate again. When the seedlings turn green, they can be flooded, but the depth should be below the split leaves; too deep will affect the normal growth of the seedlings. When the seedlings are three cun tall, shallow irrigation can be used, just covering the surface of the soil. Do not flood the seedling beds during the seedling stage. Dig small ditches around the seedling beds for drainage.

    For land preparation and transplanting, it is best to adopt a continuous operation method of plowing, irrigating, harrowing, and transplanting, which saves labor, water, and prevents over-fertilization from the sewage damaging the seedlings. Pay attention to rotating irrigation and shallow irrigation during transplanting.

    Irrigation and Drainage
    During the growth period of rice, shallow irrigation is generally practiced. In the early tillering stage of rice seedlings, water can be irrigated to a depth of two to three centimeters. In the late tillering stage, water can be irrigated to a depth of three to five centimeters to prevent excessive tillering. In the booting and heading stage, shallow irrigation should be implemented, but after 80% to 90% of the rice is grouting, water should be drained immediately. In addition, the amount of irrigation should be determined based on seedling color, soil quality, and climate conditions. If over-fertilization is found, water should be drained immediately. Sandy soil should be irrigated less frequently and more frequently. Seedlings with lighter colors should be irrigated more than seedlings with darker colors.

    From transplanting to rice maturity, the irrigation sewage must also be settled. The sedimentation tank can utilize the natural terrain beside the dry canal or be built at the head of the branch canal, and the size of the tank should be sufficient to irrigate the fields of the branch canal. In addition, the inlet and outlet of the water should be changed frequently, generally every ten to fifteen days. The inlet should be narrow and the outlet should be wide, which helps to make the fertilizer effect even.

    Finally, when using urban sewage for irrigation, it is equally important to apply manure, such as if there is a lot of nitrogen fertilizer in the sewage, more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer should be applied. It is best to choose fertilizer-resistant and lodging-resistant varieties of rice seeds. Other cultivation methods such as deep plowing and close planting should also be promoted in the same way as ordinary paddy fields, so that the rice grows better.

    利用污水灌田的经验
    高方
    辽宁抚顺市上游人民公社李石寨作业区，从1952年起，因为合理利用城市污水灌田，连年得到增产。去年全作业区引用污水灌田的八千六百四十亩水稻，平均亩产一千三百五十斤，最高的达到二千八百斤。这个作业区已经取得了利用工业污水灌田的一些经验。
    稀释
    工业污水里含有许多有害杂质，而且有时浓度过大，直接灌田，容易烧害庄稼。当地农民的经验是先用一定比例的清水稀释污水后再灌田，才能收到好的效果。抚顺市污水多系石油工业所排出的，含有酚、油等有害成份，灌田试验结果是工业污水和清水混合的比例是一比四到三比七。确定污水与清水的比例的土法是，用几个盆子栽上水稻，灌溉不同浓度的污水，就可找出适当的比例。有条件的地方也可请有关部门作化验，然后再确定比例。
    旱畦育苗，浅水插秧
    根据李石寨作业区的经验，利用污水育苗，必须旱畦育苗，以免烧苗和坏苗。旱畦育苗的办法是，在一、二公尺宽的育苗池当中，挖一尺宽到二、三寸深的小沟用来灌水。然后在苗地上撒上硫铵，使土和硫铵充分混合，而后播种，并用木磙压地，使得种子一部分在土里，一部分露在外面，再在上面铺上三、四公分厚的沙子（最好是河沙，因沙子能吸热、易渗水、又挡风）。如果苗地干燥裂缝，就要灌水。等苗高一寸时，把沙子撤下，再灌上污水。灌污水时，除经过河水稀释，还要经过畦地或一、二个空池子沉淀一天后再用，使污水经过沉淀，减少污水中的寄生虫卵和沉降浮悬体和有毒物质。灌水后再撒上硫铵。当苗色变绿时，可放水泡上，其深度要在分叶的下部，过深会影响小苗的正常成长。小苗长到三寸时即可浅灌，盖住地皮即可。苗期灌溉不要大水漫灌，在苗地周围要挖上小沟，以便排水。
    整地插秧最好采用随翻、随灌、随耙、随插秧的流水作业法，既省人力，又能节约用水和防止污水过肥伤苗。插秧时要注意轮灌浅灌。
    灌水和撤水
    在水稻发育时期，一般都实行浅灌。稻苗在分蘖前期，可灌水二、三公分，分蘖后期，可灌水三、五公分，以防止过多分蘖。在拔节孕穗时期，要实行浅灌，但在80％到90％的稻子灌浆后，又要立即撤水。此外，在灌溉时还要看苗色、土质和气候等情况决定灌水量。如果发现过肥应立即撤水。沙质土地应少灌、勤灌，苗色淡的比苗色深的应多灌。
    从插秧到稻子成熟期，灌溉的污水也必须经过沉淀。沉淀池可利用干渠旁的自然地势或在支渠头修建，池子大小够支渠灌田即可。此外，还应常调换进水口和排水口，一般十天到十五天换一次水口。入水口要窄，出水口要宽，这样作的好处是可使肥效均匀。
    最后，利用城市污水灌田，同样应该增施粪肥，如污水里的氮肥多，就应该多施磷钾肥。稻种最好选用耐肥抗倒伏的品种。其他深翻密植等耕作方法也同一般水田一样推行，使稻子长得更好。
