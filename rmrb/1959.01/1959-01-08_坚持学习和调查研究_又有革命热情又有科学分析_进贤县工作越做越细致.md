    Persisting in Study and Investigation Research, Having Both Revolutionary Enthusiasm and Scientific Analysis
    Jinxian County's Work Becomes More and More Detailed

    (Our report) Nanchang, Jiangxi Province – The broad masses of cadres in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, persisted in study and investigation research throughout the great leap forward year of 1958, making their work more and more meticulous. The Jinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized their experiences and gains in this regard, and decided to do even better in 1959, combining revolutionary enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis even more effectively.

    Throughout the past year, the Jinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized all cadres in the county to systematically study Chairman Mao's works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice," as well as the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's important policies and guidelines for each period. Through study, cadres improved their theoretical and ideological level, and consciously developed a work style of going deep into reality and strengthening investigation and research in their work. The county committee and the Party committees of various districts, townships, and communes conducted comprehensive investigations of the ideological situation of cadres and the masses every quarter, and improved their work based on the demands and opinions of the masses. When carrying out each central task, they also conducted investigations and research in advance to be well-informed.

    Because they carried out in-depth investigation and research and fully grasped the situation, the Party's various policies and guidelines could be correctly implemented. When the Meizhuang People's Commune Party Committee investigated the grain supply work, they found that some brigades had deviations in implementing the principle of ensuring that commune members were fed sufficiently and well. They one-sidedly understood that being fed sufficiently and well meant eating three meals of dry rice a day, and when there was insufficient grain, they asked the state for it, without careful calculation, resulting in waste. In light of this situation, the commune Party committee educated the cadres of various production teams and adopted the method of rationing to the dining hall, mobilizing the dining halls to find ways to ensure that everyone was fed sufficiently and well, while also conserving grain.

    In a situation where cadres and the masses were full of enthusiasm, the county Party committee was relatively calm-headed in handling many problems. There is a Junshan Lake in the county, which is a branch of Poyang Lake. Whenever Poyang Lake is windy, more than 30,000 mu of nearby fertile land is flooded. In this year's water conservancy construction campaign, cadres and the masses actively demanded that the branch be blocked off, and some people were about to start working immediately. The county Party committee expressed support for the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, and at the same time conducted detailed research and analysis on whether this project could be carried out and where it should be carried out. In order to find out where to block the mouth, Xing Haichuan, the first secretary of the county Party committee, personally took a boat to survey for seven days, and finally chose the narrowest place, which only required 1.35 million cubic meters of earth and stone to block. Because thorough investigation and research were carried out in advance, blind construction was avoided, and the project progressed smoothly.

    The reason why the cadres of Jinxian County can often persist in study and investigation research in their busy work is mainly because the county Party committee attaches importance to this work. After the communalization of the entire county, some cadres had such thoughts: "There is no time for study and investigation during the great leap forward in production!" "Now that the masses have a high level of consciousness, there is less ideological work to do, and study and investigation can be done or not." After discovering this situation, the county Party committee promptly launched a "Do we need to study and conduct investigation and research during the Great Leap Forward?" "Is our current study and investigation work sufficient or does it need to be further strengthened?" great contending, great blooming, and great debate among cadres. Through debate, the broad masses of cadres realized that: the current situation is developing rapidly, and there is much work to be followed up after communalization, and cadres lack experience in leading and managing communes, so study and investigation should not be relaxed, but should be greatly strengthened. At the same time, at every cadre meeting, the county Party committee emphasized the need to do a good job in study and investigation. Because of the close combination of study and work, the things learned can be quickly used to guide production and work, which has consolidated everyone's interest in learning. Moreover, frequent comparisons between units and individuals have also ensured the regular implementation of this system.

    The Jinxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that persisting in study and investigation research is an effective way to improve the ideological level of cadres and continuously improve their work style. In the future, every cadre must regard it as an important task and implement it regularly, so as to achieve good work, good study, and good investigation. At the same time, it also proposed to cadres to establish "three books and four notebooks" (political theory books, cultural books, technical books, investigation and research notebooks, study notebooks, labor handbooks, invention notebooks) in order to better implement the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of scientific analysis, and to do a better job this year.

### 坚持学习和调查研究　又有革命热情又有科学分析  进贤县工作越做越细致

    坚持学习和调查研究　又有革命热情又有科学分析
    进贤县工作越做越细致
    本报讯　江西省进贤县广大干部在去年大跃进的一年中，坚持学习和调查研究工作，工作愈做愈细致。中共进贤县委最近总结了这方面的经验和收获，决定在1959年要做得更好，把革命热情和科学分析的精神更好地结合起来。
    中共进贤县委在去年一年中，曾组织全县干部系统地学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”等著作，以及党的社会主义建设总路线、每个时期党的重要方针政策等。干部通过学习提高了理论思想水平，在工作中也就自觉地养成了深入实际、加强调查研究的工作作风。县委和各区、乡、社党委，每个季度都全面调查一次干部和群众的思想情况，根据群众的要求和意见改进工作。在进行每一项中心工作时，他们也都事先进行调查研究，以做到心中有数。
    由于深刻地进行了调查研究，充分掌握了情况，党的各项方针政策也就能正确地贯彻执行。梅庄人民公社党委在调查粮食供应工作时，发现有的大队对贯彻保证社员吃饱吃好的原则有偏差，他们片面地理解吃饱吃好就是每天三餐干饭，粮食不足就向国家要，而不精打细算，以致造成浪费。根据这种情况，公社党委向各生产队干部进行了教育，并采取定量到食堂的办法，发动食堂想办法，既要保证大家吃饱吃好，又要节约粮食。
    县委在干部群众干劲冲天的情况下，对许多问题的处理是头脑比较冷静的。县内有个军山湖，是鄱阳湖的岔口，只要鄱阳湖一起风，附近三万多亩良田就受淹。在今年兴修水利运动中，干部和群众积极要求堵死岔口，有的人马上就要动手干。县委对广大干部和群众的热情表示支持，同时对这个工程能不能搞和在什么地方搞，进行了详细的研究分析。为了弄清在什么地方堵口好，县委第一书记邢海川亲自坐船勘察了七天，最后选择了一个最窄的地方，只需要一百三十五万土石方就可以堵好。由于事先作了周密的调查研究，就避免了盲目动工，使工程进展很顺利。
    进贤县干部所以能在繁忙的工作中经常坚持学习和调查研究，主要由于县委重视这一工作。全县公社化以后，有部分干部产生过这种思想：“生产大跃进那有时间搞学习、调查？”“现在群众觉悟高了，思想工作少了，学习和调查研究可搞可不搞了。”县委发现这一情况后，及时在干部中展开了“大跃进中要不要学习和做调查研究工作？”“现在我们的学习和调查研究工作是够了还是需要进一步加强？”的大鸣、大放、大辩论。通过辩论，广大干部认识到：目前形势迅速向前发展，公社化后有许多工作需要跟上去，而干部又缺乏领导和管理公社的经验，因此学习和调查研究工作不仅不应放松，相反要大大加强。同时，在每次干部会议上，县委都强调要搞好学习和调查研究工作。由于注意学习同工作紧密结合，使学习的东西能够很快用来指导生产和工作，这就巩固了大家对学习的兴趣。又由于经常进行单位与单位、个人与个人之间的评比，也保证了这一制度经常贯彻执行。
    中共进贤县委认为，坚持学习和调查研究工作，是提高干部思想水平、不断改进工作作风的有效办法，今后每个干部必须把它作为自己的一项重要任务，经常贯彻执行，做到工作好、学习好、调查研究好。同时又向干部提出要建立“三书四本”（政治理论书、文化书、技术书，调查研究本、学习笔记本、劳动手册本、创造发明本），以便更好地贯彻把革命热情同科学分析的精神相结合的原则，把今年的工作做得更好。
