Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th January: TASS reports that the Soviet Foreign Minister, Gromyko, met with the American Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Davis, on January 10th and handed him a draft peace treaty with Germany and a related note from the Soviet government to the American government.

The draft peace treaty with Germany and the related note were also handed to the British Ambassador to Moscow, Reilly, and the French Ambassador to Moscow, Dejean.

Below is the note from the Soviet government to the American government:

	The Protracted Failure to Resolve the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Germany
		Seriously Complicates the Situation in Europe
The Soviet government believes it is necessary to draw the attention of the American government to the highly abnormal situation caused by the protracted failure to resolve one of the most important international issues after the war—the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Peace treaties have long been concluded with other countries that participated in World War II on the side of Germany, and their development has been placed on an independent national basis. However, the German people still do not have a peace treaty, which deprives them of the possibility of fully exercising their national sovereignty and becoming an equal member of the family of nations. Moreover, foreign troops continue to be stationed in Germany, and in some areas of Germany, such as West Berlin, even the occupation regime is preserved.

The year-by-year delay in the peaceful resolution of the German issue prevents the solution of many problems that involve not only the interests of Germany but also the interests of the countries that participated in the war against Germany. The absence of a peace treaty with Germany seriously complicates the situation in Europe, causing suspicion and distrust in relations between countries and hindering the normalization of these relations.

The resurgence of German militarism in West Germany, taking advantage of the absence of a peace treaty, cannot be ignored. This cannot but make the Soviet people, as well as the people of other European countries who have suffered serious disasters and pain more than once from militarist Germany, feel uneasy. A peace treaty in the interests of Germany's peaceful development will create the necessary conditions to prevent the tragic events of the past from recurring, in which German militarists dragged humanity into devastating wars that caused huge losses of life and property.

The Soviet government, faithful to its obligations to Germany and taking into account the legitimate interests of the German people and other European countries, has more than once proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France the drafting and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in the post-war years. Regrettably, the Soviet proposals for a peaceful resolution of the German issue have not been actively received by the Western countries, which have not only failed to put forward their own proposals but also have been unwilling to seriously discuss this long-ripe issue. For many years, they have repeatedly put forward the argument that free all-German elections must be given priority and that the issue of German unification should not be resolved by the Germans but by the four former occupying powers. This argument is also the main content of the Western countries' note of September 30, 1958, to which the Soviet government gave a detailed reply in its note of November 27, 1958, on the Berlin issue.

	Under the Current Circumstances, Signing a Peace Treaty with Germany
		Will Greatly Help the Rapprochement of the Two Germanys
If one does not indulge in illusions but faces reality squarely, it should be admitted that the restoration of German unity must inevitably go through a series of stages on the road of mutual rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Today, one can only hope that this process of development will begin, but its success depends on the efforts of the two Germanys. Refusing to draft a peace treaty with Germany is tantamount to leaving the German people without both a peace treaty and a unified state. This means maintaining the existing intolerable situation, which creates the possibility that the Federal Republic of Germany will attempt to force the German Democratic Republic to accept its form of internal system. But in this case, the German Democratic Republic also has the right to raise the question of changing the system and regime of the Federal Republic of Germany. Obviously, this will not only not help to achieve the goal of German national unity but will deepen the already deep chasm between the two Germanys.

On the other hand, signing a peace treaty under the current circumstances is precisely the measure that can enable the German people to resolve their primary national task—the restoration of national unity—as quickly as possible. Determining Germany's military status and external conditions in the treaty (compliance with these conditions can ensure Germany's internal development is free from any foreign interference) will open up bright prospects for the future of the German people and will greatly help Germans living in two countries with different socio-economic systems to seek ways to expand contact with each other and build mutual trust. The treaty will establish a good foundation for the two Germanys to approach each other and overcome the differences that still exist on the road to unification.

To be fair, it should be pointed out that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany bears a large part of the responsibility for the current situation in Germany, including the fact that Germany still does not have a peace treaty, because it has adopted a policy of reviving militarism and closely linked its policy with the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc, which fundamentally violates the national interests of Germany. If new proof is needed of the Federal Republic of Germany's implementation of this policy, then the Federal Republic of Germany's reply of January 5, 1959, to the Soviet government's note of November 27, 1958, on the Berlin issue is proof. This note shows that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is not assisting in solving the Berlin issue in a way that is conducive to European peace and the German nation, but is instead doing everything possible to stir up fanaticism and aggravate the situation around the Berlin issue in order to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin.

It cannot be considered normal that countries that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany in the past have to wait and passively observe in the important and urgent matter of drafting and signing a peace treaty with Germany. Since these countries were able to cooperate closely with each other during the war, it is still possible to find a common language now, despite differences, to carry the cause of peacefully resolving the German issue to the end, thereby ensuring that the people of European countries, including the German people, can live a peaceful and tranquil life. In view of the fact that in the two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—a movement for the rapid drafting and signing of a peace treaty is flourishing, resolving this task is all the more urgent and necessary.

	The Draft Peace Treaty with Germany Prepared by the Soviet Government
		Will Enable Germany to Achieve Peaceful and Democratic Development
The Soviet government, based on the above considerations, and in order to place the cause of peacefully resolving the German issue on a practical basis, has therefore prepared a draft peace treaty and hereby submits it to the American government for study.

The Soviet state has no intention whatsoever of dividing the world into victors and vanquished, nor does it harbor any vengeful feelings towards its former war enemies. The basis of the peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union is to advocate for Germany's peaceful and democratic development. The draft stipulates the restoration of the German people's complete sovereignty over Germany, German territory, and German airspace. No restrictions are imposed on Germany in developing its peaceful economy, trade, shipping, and access to the world market. Germany is recognized as having the right to possess its own armed forces necessary for defense. All these clauses in the draft provide broad possibilities for the German people to engage in peaceful and creative labor and ensure that they enjoy equal status among the people of other countries in the world.

Naturally, the draft treaty stipulates certain military restrictions, which the Soviet government is convinced are in line with both the national interests of the German people, who have twice traversed the abyss of world war, and the common interests of the world. Among the military obligations undertaken by Germany is, first and foremost, the prohibition of the production of nuclear and rocket weapons, and the prohibition of equipping the German army with these weapons. This approach will help strengthen European security and also help eliminate one of the important obstacles that currently divide the two Germanys.

The following clause in the peace treaty is of great significance for ensuring European peace, this clause excludes the possibility of Germany participating in any military group that is directed against any country that fought against Hitler's Germany, and whose participants are not all four major allies of the anti-Hitler coalition—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Including this clause in the treaty will, to a great extent, free humanity from the threat of a new war, because no one can deny that it is the military alliance between a major power or some major powers with Germany, directed against another major power, that will greatly deepen this threat.

	The Soviet Government Proposes Convening a Peace Conference Within Two Months
		To Draft and Sign Agreed-Upon Treaty Articles
Considering the above circumstances, the Soviet government proposes convening a peace conference in Warsaw or Prague within a period of two months to discuss the proposed draft peace treaty with Germany, draft and sign agreed-upon treaty articles. One party participating in the conference will be the governments of the countries that sent armed forces to participate in the war against Germany, and the other party will be the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, which will represent Germany in signing the peace treaty. If a German Confederation has been established by the time the peace treaty is signed, then the peace treaty can be signed by the German Confederation and the representatives of the two German states.

Needless to say, the Soviet government believes that the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have the right to reach an agreement on any appropriate representation of Germany in the drafting and signing of the peace treaty.

The starting point for the Soviet government in proposing the draft peace treaty with Germany is that the attitudes of the parties concerned towards the German issue have been completely clarified, and now it is necessary to put aside unnecessary disputes and make practical resolutions that are in line with the current situation in Germany and the interests of consolidating European peace.

The Soviet government believes that only those who are unwilling to see the German people happy, who want to continue to see Germany trapped in division, who are unwilling to see Europe become a continent with lasting peace and security, and who want to keep it as a source of dangerous tension and "cold war" that harbors serious threats to the cause of peace will not express a positive attitude towards the proposal to sign a peace treaty.

	The US, Britain, and France Maintain Their Occupation of West Berlin for the Purpose of Conducting Hostile Activities
		Against the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic
The Soviet government believes that, in addition to concluding a peace treaty, it is now possible to take practical measures on the German issue as proposed by the Soviet government in its note to the US government on November 27, 1958.

Since the US government has explained its views on the above proposals in its note of December 31, 1958, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to state the following in reply to this note:

The period has long passed when the Allied governments demanded that Germany implement the terms of unconditional surrender, when the commanders-in-chief of the four-power occupation forces exercised supreme power in Germany, and when the Control Council and its "Allied Kommandatura" jointly administered "Greater Berlin." However, it can be considered that the US note was written based on the situation in the early years of the occupation of Germany, and it completely fails to take into account the enormous changes that have taken place in Germany in the post-war years. The note is imbued with the spirit of that era from beginning to end, and it strives to defend its "occupation rights" and affirm these rights, although the US government also recognizes that it is abnormal for the occupation regime established in 1945 to still exist in Berlin thirteen years after the end of the war.

No one will believe the argument that the presence of US troops in Berlin is justified by the fact that US troops entered Berlin because of World War II.

If one puts aside the outdated grievances of the occupation period and calmly assesses the current situation, it is clear that the attempt by the United States, Britain, and France to maintain their position in West Berlin has nothing in common with the consequences of the last war or with the post-war agreements stipulating that Germany should develop into a peaceful and democratic country. This attempt is based on a new situation that has arisen due to the Western countries' blatant violation of the above agreements, their departure from friendly Allied relations, and the turning of their policies towards sharpening relations with the Soviet Union and establishing military blocs.

Only those who want to use West Berlin as a tool to conduct hostile activities against the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and countries friendly to them in order to further deepen existing contradictions and exacerbate international tensions advocate maintaining the status quo in Berlin.

Maintaining the status quo in West Berlin is tantamount to maintaining the danger of the "cold war" developing into a third world war that would have serious consequences for the people of all countries. Under these circumstances, no one would expect the Soviet Union to support the occupation regime in West Berlin with its own hands.

Immediately after the defeat of Hitler's Germany, occupation was understandable and necessary because it was intended to transform Germany's political life on a peaceful and democratic basis, but now its task is to provide cover for turning West Germany into a stronghold of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the heart of the German Democratic Republic.

	The Four Powers Have Declared the End of the State of War with Germany
		Therefore, There Is No Basis for Continued Occupation
The US government's note refers to the Allied agreements on Berlin in 1944 and 1945, but these agreements are interpreted as not being subordinate to the Potsdam Agreement and as still granting the Western countries the right to station their troops in West Berlin. This interpretation cannot be agreed to under any circumstances because it violates well-known facts and the obligations undertaken by the major powers to Germany.

The status of the four powers in Berlin did not arise and exist in isolation from all other Allied agreements on Germany; it is entirely subordinate to the completion of the basic tasks of the occupation of Germany in the early post-war period as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. The United States, Britain, and France have embarked on the road of rearming West Germany and dragging it into their military blocs, blatantly violating the Potsdam Agreement, thereby eliminating the legal basis for maintaining the existing status of Berlin and the entire occupation of Germany.

The Soviet Union has always abided by its obligations under international agreements, including its obligations to Germany. Moreover, when the Western countries repeatedly violated Allied agreements and incited West Germany to embark on the road of militarism and revanchism, no one could blame the Soviet Union for not issuing warnings. If the three Western countries had respected the Potsdam Agreement and fulfilled the obligations they had undertaken under this agreement in the same way as the Soviet Union, it can be said with certainty that not only would the Berlin issue not exist now, but the entire German issue would not exist, because they would have been resolved long ago in accordance with the interests of the German people and the interests of European peace.

The agreements of the four powers on Berlin, as well as on the entire Germany, are temporary and only applicable to the period of the occupation of Germany. But the occupation has ended. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries have declared the end of the state of war with Germany. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the assertion of any right to continued occupation in the US note is groundless.

Based on the above facts, it is not difficult to understand that the Soviet side did not unilaterally abolish the agreements on Berlin, as the Western governments have tried to create the illusion, but merely drew a logical conclusion based on the current situation, which is that the occupation of Germany has ended and the Western countries have blatantly violated the obligations they undertook at the end of the war.

The US government states in its note that the Western countries acquired the right to be in Berlin because they "allowed" the Soviet Union to occupy certain areas of Germany that had been occupied by US and British troops during the war. This argument is nothing more than a blatant distortion of the facts. It is well known that the agreement on the occupation of German areas was reached early in the war, at a time when it was difficult to predict whose troops would reach these areas first. At the same time, it must be reminded that before the end of the war in Europe, there were Soviet troops not only in Germany but also in many countries, especially in Austria. But the Soviet Union has never raised the issue of any compensation for the withdrawal of its troops from these territories, nor has it demanded any concessions in order to allow Allied troops to enter areas occupied by Soviet troops, such as Vienna, because making such demands would mean making a shameful deal with other people's territories. It can only be surprising that the US government has such an attitude towards a country like Germany.

	Restoring German Unity Is an Internal German Issue
		Only the Two Germanys Can Resolve It Through Consultation
The US government states that it can agree to discuss the Berlin issue in the context of broader negotiations to resolve the German issue (including the unification of Germany) and European security issues.

The Soviet government has pointed out more than once that representatives of the two countries cannot hold any meetings to discuss the unification of Germany because this issue is not within the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. Negotiations among the four countries on the unification of Germany were completely legitimate during the occupation period, when these countries performed the functions of administering and controlling Germany. Now that the occupation phase has passed and two autonomous Germanys have been formed on German territory, the issue of restoring German unity has become an internal German issue that can only be resolved through the rapprochement and consultation of these two countries.

As for the issue of European security, the Soviet government believes that its resolution is of great significance. It has proposed more than once proposals aimed at developing a series of measures to ensure European security. For example, the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the participants of the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the withdrawal of foreign troops from European territories, and the Soviet Union's support for Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. The Soviet government is convinced that the issue of European security needs to be discussed separately and cannot be confused with other issues, including the Berlin issue. Incidentally, the US government has not mentioned a word in its note about ways to guarantee European security that would be acceptable to the countries concerned.

Under these circumstances, one cannot help but get the impression that the US government is making the resolution of issues such as the Berlin issue and the European security issue interdependent, which is clearly intended to complicate the work of reaching mutually agreed decisions on these two issues.

	The Soviet Union Suggests Discussing the Berlin Issue with the Relevant Countries
		Willing to Study Relevant Proposals to Eliminate the Occupation Regime
The Soviet government seeks to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations with the relevant countries. The Soviet government believes that its proposal to declare West Berlin a demilitarized free city will create a healthy foundation for reaching an agreement because this proposal is in line with the common interests of consolidating European peace. At the same time, the implementation of the Soviet proposal will not harm the prestige and security of any country, nor will it bring unilateral benefits and advantages to anyone.

Naturally, the Soviet government is far from believing that its proposal for a free city of West Berlin is not subject to any additions and modifications. It is willing to study other countries' relevant proposals on this issue, as long as these proposals are aimed at eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin and consolidating European peace.

The Western countries' refusal to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union that are conducive to normalizing the status of Berlin will certainly not prevent the Soviet Union from stopping halfway without reaching its goal, because this goal is proposed by life itself, and it can guarantee the stability and tranquility of the situation in Central Europe.

No one can prevent the Soviet Union from unloading its functions regarding Berlin, its functions regarding Berlin's ties with West Germany, and from resolving the issues arising therefrom through agreement with the German Democratic Republic.

In summary, in addition to the proposal to convene a peace conference, the Soviet government also proposes discussing the Berlin issue with the relevant countries. However, if the Western countries believe that it is appropriate to exchange views with the Soviet Union on the content of the peace treaty before the conference is convened, the Soviet government will agree to do so. In this case, it must be ensured that the two countries directly related to the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, have corresponding participation.

The Soviet government hopes that the US government will study the proposed proposals and draft treaty with due attention and strive to enable the peace conference to successfully complete the important tasks it has undertaken.

At the same time, the Soviet government is confident that the US government will recognize the abnormal phenomenon of maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin and will be able to draw the necessary conclusions based on the current situation, thereby promoting the resolution of the Berlin issue in accordance with the requirements of consolidating European and world peace.

### 苏联建议召开和会讨论和签订对德和约

    为了把和平解决德国问题的事业进行到底
    苏联建议召开和会讨论和签订对德和约
    在给美英法政府的照会中并表示愿通过谈判解决柏林问题
    新华社11日讯　塔斯社莫斯科10日电：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯1月10日接见了美国驻苏联临时代办戴维斯，并且把对德和约草案和苏联政府给美国政府的有关照会交给他。
    对德和约草案和有关的照会还分别交给了英国驻莫斯科大使赖利和法国驻莫斯科大使德让。
    下面是苏联政府给美国政府的照会：
      迟迟没有解决对德和约问题
          使欧洲的局势严重地复杂化
    苏联政府认为，需要提请美国政府注意由于战后最重要的国际问题之一——缔结对德和约问题迟迟未能解决而造成十分不正常的局势。
    同站在德国方面参加第二次世界大战的其他国家早已缔结了和约，它们的发展已经置于独立的民族的基础之上，而德国人民仍然没有和约，使他们失去了完全行使自己的国家主权和成为各国人民大家庭中平等的一员的可能。不但如此，在德国境内仍然继续驻扎着外国军队，而在德国的某些地区，例如在西柏林，甚至还保存着占领制度。
    对德问题的和平解决一年一年地拖延下去，就使得很多不仅牵涉到德国的利益，而且也牵涉到参加对德作战的国家的利益的问题得不到解决。由于没有对德和约，使欧洲的局势严重地复杂化，引起各国关系中的怀疑和不信任，妨碍这些关系的正常化。
    德国军国主义利用没有和约的情况，重新在西德抬头得势，对于这种情况也不能漠然视之。这不能不使苏联人民以及欧洲其他被军国主义德国不止一次地造成严重灾难和痛苦的国家人民感到不安。符合德国和平发展利益的和约将会造成必要的条件，来永远防止过去的悲惨事件重演，在过去，德国军国主义者把人类曾经拖入造成生命财产巨大损失的毁灭性的战争中去。
    苏联政府忠于对德国承担的义务，并且考虑到德国人民和其他欧洲国家人民的合法利益，它在战后年代里不止一次地向美国、英国和法国政府提出过拟定和缔结对德和约的建议。遗憾的是，苏联的关于和平解决德国问题的建议没有得到西方国家的积极对待，这些国家不仅没有提出自己的建议，而且也不愿认真地讨论这个早已成熟了的问题。它们许多年来反复提出一个论调，大谈什么必须优先举行全德自由选举以及统一德国问题不应由德国人解决而应该由四个前占领国家解决。这一论调也是西方国家1958年9月30日照会中的主要内容，苏联政府1958年11月27日关于柏林问题的照会已对西方国家的照会作了详尽的答复。
      在目前情况下签订对德和约
          大大有助于两个德国的接近
    如果不陶醉于幻想而正视现实的话，就应该承认，恢复德国的统一不可避免地要在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国互相接近的道路上经过一系列阶段。今天只能希望这一发展过程开始，但是它的成功要靠两个德国的努力。拒绝拟定对德和约，这种作法就等于使德国人民既没有和约，又没有统一的国家。这也就是说，要保持现存的令人不能容忍的局面，这种局面造成了这样一种可能性：德意志联邦共和国将企图强迫德意志民主共和国接受它那种形式的内部制度。但是在这种情况下，德意志民主共和国也有权提出改变德意志联邦共和国的制度和政权的问题。显然，这不仅无助于达到德国民族统一的目的，反而会加深两个德国之间的本来就已很深的鸿沟。
    另一方面，在目前情况下签订和约，这正是能够使德国人民尽速解决它的全民族的主要任务——恢复国家统一的措施。和约中确定德国的军事地位以及外部条件（遵守这些条件就可以保障德国内部发展不受任何外国干涉），这样就会给德国人民打开未来德国的光辉前景，会大大有助于居住在两个社会经济制度不同的国家的德国人寻求道路来扩大彼此间的接触，建立彼此间的信任。和约将建立良好的基础，使两个德国接近，克服现在两个德国在走向统一的道路上还存在的分歧。
    为了公平起见，应该指出，德意志联邦共和国政府对德国的当前局面，包括德国至今还没有和约一事，应负有很大一部分责任，因为它采取了复活军国主义的方针，并且把自己的政策同根本违背德国民族利益的、北大西洋公约组织军事集团的计划紧密联系在一起。如果需要对德意志联邦共和国政府执行这种方针拿出新的证明的话，那么德意志联邦共和国政府1959年1月5日答复苏联政府1958年11月27日关于柏林问题的照会的复照就是证明。这个照会表明，德意志联邦共和国政府不是协助解决柏林问题，以有利于欧洲和平和德意志民族，反而是千方百计地围绕柏林问题煽起狂热和加剧局势，以达到维持西柏林的占领制度的目的。
    不能认为这种局面是正常的，即过去参加对希特勒德国作战的国家在拟定和签订对德和约这件重要的、不容拖延的事情上不得不等待和消极旁观。既然这些国家在战时能够彼此密切合作，那么现在尽管存在分歧，仍有可能找到共同的语言，来把和平解决德国问题的事业进行到底，从而保证包括德国人民在内的欧洲各国人民能过安宁和平的生活。鉴于下述情况，解决这一任务更为迫切必要：在两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国，争取尽速拟定和签订和约的运动正在蓬勃发展。
      苏联政府拟定的对德和约草案
          将使德国得到和平民主的发展
    苏联政府从上述的考虑出发，为了把和平解决德国问题的事业置于实际的基础上，因此拟定了和约草案，特此提交美国政府研究。
    苏维埃国家根本没有把世界分成战胜者和战败者的企图，也根本不对自己过去的战争敌人抱有复仇情绪。苏联提出的和约草案的基础是：主张德国得到和平民主的发展。草案规定恢复德国人民对德国、德国领土和领空的完全主权。在发展本国和平经济、贸易、航运和进入世界市场等方面不对德国施加任何限制。承认德国有权拥有国防所必需的本国武装部队。草案中的所有这些条款为德国人民从事和平创造性劳动提供了广阔的可能，并保证他们在世界其他各国人民当中享有平等地位。
    自然，条约草案规定了某些军事上的限制，苏联政府确信，这些限制既符合两次走过世界大战深渊的德国人民的民族利益，也符合世界的共同利益。在德国承担的军事义务中首先包括禁止生产核武器和火箭武器，并且禁止用这些武器装备德国军队。这种做法会有助于加强欧洲的安全，也有助于消除目前使两个德国分裂的重要障碍之一。
    和约中下列条款对于保障欧洲和平有重大的意义，这个条款排除了德国参加任何这样的军事集团的可能性，它的矛头针对曾对希特勒德国作战的任何国家，它的参加国不是反希特勒联盟中的所有四个主要盟国——苏联、美国、英国和法国。把这一条包括在条约中，将在很大程度上使人类摆脱新战争的威胁，因为谁也不能否认，正是由于一个大国或一些大国同德国结成矛头针对另外的大国的军事联盟，这种威胁将会大大加深。
    苏联政府建议在两月内召开和会
        草拟和签订一致同意的条约条文
    考虑到上述情况，苏联政府建议在两个月的期限内在华沙或布拉格召开和会来讨论拟议中的对德和约草案，草拟和签订一致同意的条约条文。参加会议的一方将是曾派武装部队参加对德战争的国家的政府，另一方将是德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府，这两国政府将代表德国签订和约。如果到签订和约的时候已经建立了德意志邦联，那末就可以由德意志邦联以及两个德意志国家的代表来签订和约。
    不用说，苏联政府认为德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府有权就拟定和签订和约时德国的任何应有的代表权问题达成协议。
    苏联政府提出对德和约草案的出发点是：有关各方对德国问题的态度已经完全明确了，现在必须抛开不必要的争论来作出符合德国当前情况和巩固欧洲和平的利益的实际的决议。
    苏联政府相信，对签订和约的建议不表示积极态度的只有那样一些人，他们不愿意德国人民幸福，他们想继续看到德国陷于分裂之中，他们不愿意使欧洲变为一个有持久和平和安全的大陆，他们想使它依然成为对和平事业包藏着严重威胁的、危险的紧张局势和“冷战”的策源地。
    美英法保持占领西柏林的目的是对苏联
  和民主德国进行敌对
  活动
    苏联政府认为，除缔结和约外，现在还已经可以如苏联政府在1958年11月27日致美国政府的照会中所建议的那样，就德国问题采取实际措施。
    既然美国政府在1958年12月31日的照会中已经说明了它对上述建议的看法，苏联政府认为在答复这个照会时必须说明如下：
    这样的时期早已成为过去，即：盟国政府要求德国执行无条件投降的条件，四国占领军总司令在德国行使最高权力，管制委员会和它所领导的“盟军司令部”共同管理“大柏林”。但是，可以认为，美国的照会是根据占领德国的最初几年的情况写成的，根本没有考虑到战后年代在德国所发生的巨大变化。这个照会从头到尾贯穿了那个时代的精神，力图为自己的“占领权利”辩解，并肯定这种权利，虽然美国政府也承认这样一种情况是不正常的：战争结束已经十三年了，在柏林却还存在着1945年所建立的占领制度。
    硬用美军是由于第二次世界大战才开进柏林这一点来为美军驻扎在柏林辩解，这种论点是谁都不会相信的。
    如果把占领时期那些过时的芥蒂抛在一边，冷静地估计当前的情况，那就很清楚：美、英、法三国企图保持在西柏林的地位的做法是同上次战争的后果以及同规定使德国发展成为和平民主的国家的一些战后协定毫无共同之处的。这种企图是以一种新的情况为基础的，这种情况的产生是由于西方国家粗暴地破坏上述协定，离开友好的盟国关系以及使它们的政策转向使同苏联的关系尖锐化和建立军事集团。
    只有那样一些人才主张保持柏林的现状；他们想利用西柏林作为工具，来对苏联、德意志民主共和国和同它们友好的国家进行敌对活动，以使现有的矛盾进一步加深，并使国际紧张局势加剧。
    保持西柏林的现状，就等于保持使“冷战”发展成为会给各国人民带来严重后果的第三次世界大战的危险性。在这种情况下，谁也不会期望苏联亲手支持西柏林的占领政权。
    紧接着希特勒德国被击溃之后，占领是可以理解的，也是必要的，因为这是为了要在和平民主的基础上改造德国的政治生活，可是现在它的任务却是为了打掩护，来把西德变为北大西洋公约组织设在德意志民主共和国心脏的据点。
      四国已宣布结束对德作战状态
          因而继续占领的权利毫无根据
    美国政府的照会中提到1944年和1945年盟国关于柏林的协定，但是这些协定被解释成为并不从属于波茨坦协定，并且到现在也还给予西方国家在西柏林驻扎自己军队的权利。对于这种解释无论如何也不能同意，因为它违背众所周知的事实和各大国对德所承担的义务。
    四国在柏林的地位并不是脱离所有其他盟国对德协定而孤立产生和存在的，它完全服从于完成波茨坦协定规定的战后初期占领德国的基本任务。美国、英国和法国走上了重新武装西德和把西德拉入自己的军事集团的道路，粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，从而消除了保持柏林现存的地位以及整个对德国的占领的法律基础。
    苏联过去和现在一向遵守自己按照国际协定所承担的义务，其中也包括对德国的义务。不仅如此，当西方国家接二连三地破坏盟国协定，唆使西德走上军国主义和复仇主义的道路时，任何人也不能责难苏联，说它没有提出警告。如果三个西方国家也像苏联那样尊重波茨坦协定并且完成根据这个协定所承担的义务，那就可以肯定地说，现在不仅柏林问题不会存在，而且整个德国问题也不会存在，因为它们早已会按照德国人民的利益、按照欧洲和平的利益得到解决了。
    四国关于柏林，以及关于整个德国的协定是暂时性的，仅适用于占领德国的时期。但是占领已经结束了。苏联、美国、英国、法国和其他国家已经宣布结束对德作战状态。因此十分明显，美国照会中关于什么继续占领的任何权利的论断是毫无根据的。
    根据上述事实不难了解，苏联方面并不是像西方国家政府所企图造成的假象那样单方面废除了关于柏林的协定，而只不过是根据目前的局势作出逻辑的结论，目前的局势是对德国的占领已经结束，西方国家粗暴地破坏了它们在战争末期所承担的义务。
    美国政府在照会中说，西方国家取得在柏林的权利，还因为它们“曾经让”苏联占领美国和英国军队在战争时期所占领的德国某些地区。这种论调不外是粗暴地歪曲事实。大家都很清楚，关于占领德国地区的协议早在战争进行过程中就已经取得，当时甚至很难预料谁的军队首先达到这些地区。同时还必须提醒一下，在欧洲战争结束以前，不仅在德国有苏联军队，而且在很多国家境内，特别是在奥地利也有。但是苏联从来也没有提出过自己军队撤出这些领土要任何抵偿的问题，同样也没有要求任何让步才允许盟国的军队开入苏联军队所占领的地区，例如，维也纳，因为提出这种要求就意味着拿别人的领土做可耻的买卖。美国政府竟然对像德国这样的国家抱这种态度，这只能令人惊奇。
    恢复德国统一是德国内部的问题
        只有两个德国通过协商才能解决
    美国政府声明，它可以同意在更广泛地谈判解决德国问题（其中包括统一德国）和欧洲安全问题的情况下讨论柏林问题。
    苏联政府已经不止一次地指出，两国代表不能举行任何会议来讨论统一德国的问题，因为这个问题不在苏联、美国、英国和法国的权限以内。四国关于统一德国的谈判在占领期间曾经是完全合法的，当时这些国家执行着管理和管制德国的职能。目前占领阶段已经过去了，在德国领土上形成了两个自主的德国，恢复德国统一的问题成了德国内部的问题，这个问题只有通过这两个国家接近和协商的途径才能得到解决。
    至于欧洲安全的问题，苏联政府认为它的解决具有重大的意义。它不止一次地提出旨在制定保证欧洲安全的一系列措施的建议。比如，关于北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织参加国之间缔结互不侵犯条约，关于外国军队撤出欧洲领土，以及关于苏联支持波兰的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。苏联政府确信，欧洲安全的问题需要专门讨论，不能把它同其他问题，其中也包括柏林问题，混淆在一起。顺便说一下，美国政府在照会中对于有关国家可以接受的保障欧洲安全的途径只字未提。
    在这种情况下不能不使人产生这样的印象：美国政府使柏林问题和欧洲安全问题这样一些问题的解决处于相互依赖状态，这显然是要使就这两个问题通过双方同意的决定的工作复杂化。
      苏联建议同有关国家讨论柏林问题
          乐意研究消除占领制度的有关建议
    苏联政府力求通过有关国家的谈判来解决柏林问题。苏联政府相信，它关于宣布西柏林为非军事化自由城市的建议将为达成协议创造健康的基础，因为这个建议符合巩固欧洲和平的共同利益。同时，实现苏联的建议不会损害任何国家的威信和安全，也不会给任何人带来单方面的利益和好处。
    自然，苏联政府远不认为，它的关于西柏林自由城市的建议不得作任何补充和修改。它乐意研究其他国家就这个问题提出的有关建议，只要这些建议是为了消除西柏林的占领制度和巩固欧洲和平。
    西方国家拒绝同苏联举行有利于使柏林地位正常化的谈判当然不能阻止苏联停在半途而不去达到目标，因为这个目标是生活本身提出来的，它可以保障中欧局势的稳定和安宁。
    任何人都不能阻挠苏联卸下它所履行的对柏林的职能、对柏林同西德的联系的职能以及通过同德意志民主共和国协议的办法解决由此产生的问题。
    综上所述，除了关于召开和会的建议以外，苏联政府还建议同有关国家讨论柏林问题。但是，如果西方国家认为在会议召开以前事先就和约内容问题同苏联交换意见是适宜的话，苏联政府将同意这样做。在这种情况下，必须保证德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国这两个同缔结对德和约直接有关的国家有相应的参加。
    苏联政府希望，美国政府会以应有的注意来研究提出的建议和和约草案，努力使和会能够顺利完成它所负担的重大任务。
    同时，苏联政府相信，美国政府会承认保留西柏林的占领制度是不正常的现象，并能根据当前局面作出必要的结论，从而按照巩固欧洲和世界和平利益的要求那样来促进柏林问题的解决。
