Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, 3rd: According to TASS, Soviet Premier Khrushchev said in Minsk today that the launching of the Soviet cosmic rocket means that we were the first in the world to open the road from Earth to the Moon.

    Khrushchev made these remarks at a conference in Minsk held by the Belorussian Supreme Soviet and the Central Committee of the Belorussian Communist Party to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Belorussian Republic and the Belorussian Communist Party.

    Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's new victory once again convincingly demonstrates that the socialist system promotes the rapid development of the economy, science, technology, and culture, and opens up vast space for the Soviet people to develop their talents and abilities.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union's victory shattered the enemy's slanders attempting to defame the Soviet system and socialism. The Soviet people have made tremendous achievements in the past forty-one years. They have built socialism. Now, the Soviet Union's industrial production level ranks second in the world, and it ranks first in the world in the manufacture and production of intercontinental rockets, the launching of artificial earth satellites, and many other scientific and technological achievements.

    Speaking of the achievements made by the Belorussian Republic in the forty years since its establishment, Khrushchev said that Belorussia is now a powerful industrial-collective agricultural republic.

    Khrushchev cited a lot of data to illustrate the huge losses caused by the fascist bandits during World War II in Belorussia. These bandits burned 209 cities and workers' districts, and 9,200 villages. The losses suffered by the national economy of the Belorussian Republic alone are calculated at 75 billion rubles.

    Khrushchev said that now the people of Belorussia have not only restored the destroyed economy but have also far exceeded the level of pre-war industrial, agricultural, and cultural construction development. Now Belorussia's industrial output value is 26 times more than in 1913, and electricity production is 4.4 times more than in 1940. Belorussia ranks among the world's economically developed countries in terms of the output of machine tools and tractors per capita.

    Khrushchev emphasized that the reason why the working people of Belorussia have been able to accomplish this feat is that the great source of strength lies in the essence of the Soviet social system and state system, in the socialist nature of the national economy, in the fraternal friendship of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and in the correct leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, which is closely linked to the people.

    赫鲁晓夫指出
    苏联最先打开通向月球之路
    粉碎敌人诽谤社会主义谰言
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社明斯克3日电：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天在明斯克说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射意味着，我们在世界上最先打开了从地球通到月球的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫这番话是在白俄罗斯最高苏维埃和白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会庆祝白俄罗斯共和国和白俄罗斯共产党成立四十周年的大会上讲的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的新胜利又一次令人信服地表明，社会主义制度促进经济、科学、技术和文化的飞跃发展，并且为苏联人民发展他们的天才和才能开辟了广阔的天地。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联的胜利粉碎了敌人企图诽谤苏维埃制度、诽谤社会主义的谰言。苏联人民四十一年来建树了巨大的功勋，他们建成了社会主义，现在，苏联的工业生产水平占世界第二位，而在制造和生产洲际火箭，发射人造地球卫星和其他许多科学技术成就方面已占世界第一位。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到白俄罗斯共和国在它成立的四十年中所获得的成就时说，白俄罗斯如今是一个强大的工业—集体农业的共和国。
    赫鲁晓夫列举许多资料，说明白俄罗斯在第二次世界大战年代里由于法西斯强盗的破坏而造成的巨大损失。这些强盗焚毁了二百零九个城市和工人区、九千二百个村庄。仅仅计算出来的白俄罗斯共和国国民经济遭到的损失就有七百五十亿卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在白俄罗斯人民不仅恢复了被破坏了的经济，而且远远超过了战前的工业、农业和文化建设发展的水平。现在白俄罗斯工业产值比1913年多二十六倍，电力产量比1940年多四点四倍。白俄罗斯机床和拖拉机的生产按人口计算的产量方面，名列世界经济发达国家的前茅。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，白俄罗斯劳动人民之所以能够完成这一功勋，其巨大的力量源泉在于苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的实质，在于国民经济的社会主义性质，在于苏联各族人民的兄弟友谊，在于同人民血肉相连的苏联共产党的正确领导。
