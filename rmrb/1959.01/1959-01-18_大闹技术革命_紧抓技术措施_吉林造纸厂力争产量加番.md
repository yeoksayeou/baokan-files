The entire workforce of Jilin Paper Mill, with the firm conviction of "turning one factory into two, doubling output," has launched a great leap forward in production this year. They are preparing to unleash a technical revolution, aggressively tackle key production areas, and formulate reliable measures to increase this year's paper output from last year's actual production level of over 70,000 tons to 120,000 to 140,000 tons.

Jilin Paper Mill is one of China's large-scale paper mills. In the early days of liberation, it only had two old paper machines with an annual output of 525 tons. In recent years, the factory has continuously built and expanded machine sets and tapped the potential of equipment by utilizing old equipment. By last year, production capacity had reached an annual output of over 70,000 tons, and it could produce high-quality newsprint and cement bag paper. In order to meet the huge demand for paper in cultural and industrial construction this year, since last winter, the factory's Party committee has mobilized the masses to launch a technical revolution, firmly grasp technical organizational measures, and consequently, production levels have been greatly improved. No. 8 paper machine is an old-fashioned Fourdrinier machine. At the beginning of last year, the speed of this paper machine was only 156 meters per minute. In the past, some people believed that the speed of this type of paper machine could not exceed 200 meters per minute. However, worker Sun Laigui created a controller to prevent copper wire breakage and thoroughly overhauled the equipment, adjusted some process equipment and production technical conditions, and strengthened coordination between processes, which greatly increased the speed and created a national record of 270 meters per minute. Due to the meticulous and thorough preparations, normal production could still be ensured after the speed was increased. After the speed of one paper machine was increased, the remaining seven paper machines of the same type also rose to the challenge. By the end of last year, the speed of three paper machines had exceeded 200 meters per minute. Now, all the factory's employees are full of confidence and determined to learn from the experience of No. 8 paper machine, increase the speed of all eight Fourdrinier machines to more than 200 meters per minute; No. 8 machine will also strive to mechanize some of the most difficult manual paper guiding operations, replace the underpowered active motor, and further break through the speed of 300 meters per minute, so that the production capacity of one paper machine this year will equal that of two paper machines at the beginning of last year.

In the process of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, the factory paid special attention to promptly promoting the advanced experience of brother factories. In the past, No. 5 paper machine used 15 beaters and it was still not enough. After adopting the advanced experience of continuous beating, only 10 beaters were needed. Recently, the number of beaters has been reduced to five. Due to the promotion of this advanced technology, not only was the problem of insufficient beating capacity completely solved, but also electricity consumption was greatly saved.

In order to increase the production of pulp, the factory is also stepping up the expansion of the mirabilite pulp workshop. After the new installation of four large digesters is put into production, the production capacity of mirabilite pulp will be increased by about one time. While vigorously tapping the production potential, the groundwood pulp workshop is also trying to use self-made small indigenous wood grinders to increase production. In addition, they also plan to help the people's communes near Jilin City produce pulp by indigenous methods to supply part of the pulp needed by the factory.

The electricity consumption in the Jilin area is growing rapidly, and the power supply cannot meet the factory's production needs. The workers are determined to run their own power supply by combining indigenous and foreign methods. In addition to starting the construction of a regular power plant, they put forward the slogan "Seek electricity from all available energy sources" and widely use indigenous turbines, old car heads, tank heads, airplane heads, locomobiles, and drainage water power to generate electricity. In addition, they are also trying to set up satellite factories to produce and recycle major raw materials such as caustic soda, felt, and copper wire. (Attached photo)

    大闹技术革命　紧抓技术措施
    吉林造纸厂力争产量加番
    本报讯　吉林造纸厂的全体职工抱着“一厂变两厂，产量翻一番”的坚定信心，揭开了今年生产更大跃进的序幕。他们准备大闹技术革命，猛攻生产关键，制定可靠措施，把今年纸产量由去年实产七万多吨的水平，跃到十二至十四万吨。
    吉林造纸厂是我国大型纸厂之一，解放初期只有两台旧造纸机，年产纸五百二十五吨。几年来，这个厂利用旧设备不断拼建机台和挖掘设备潜力，到去年为止，生产能力已经达到年产七万多吨，并且可以生产质量优良的新闻纸和水泥袋纸。为了满足今年文化和工业建设对纸张的巨大需要，从去冬开始，工厂党委就发动群众大闹技术革命，紧抓技术组织措施，因而生产水平有了很大的提高。八号纸机是一台旧式长网机，去年年初这台纸机车速每分钟抄纸只达到一百五十六公尺。过去有人认为这类型纸机车速不能超过二百公尺。但是工人孙来贵创造了防止铜网断头控制器和彻底进行了设备检修，调整了部分工艺设备和生产技术条件，并加强了工序间的协作，结果使车速大大提高，创造了每分钟抄纸二百七十公尺的全国最高纪录。由于各种准备工作做得细致周密，在提高车速后，仍能保证生产正常。一台纸机车速提高了，其余七台同型纸机也奋起直追，到去年年末，已有三台纸机车速超过了二百公尺。现在全厂职工信心百倍，决心吸取八号纸机的经验，把八台长网机的车速都提高到二百公尺以上；八号机还争取把部分最困难的人工引纸操作实现机械化，更换能力不足的主动电机，进一步突破每分钟抄纸三百公尺的速度，使今年一台纸机的生产能力顶上去年年初的两台纸机。
    这个厂在大搞技术革命中，特别注意及时推广兄弟厂的先进经验。五号纸机过去用十五台打浆机还不够用，采用连续打浆的先进经验以后，只用十台打浆机就够了。最近打浆机又减少到五台。由于这一先进技术的推广，不仅彻底解决了打浆能力跟不上的问题，而且大大节约了用电。
    为了增加纸浆的产量，该厂还抓紧扩建芒硝纸浆车间，新装四个大蒸球投入生产后，芒硝纸浆生产能力将提高一倍左右。磨纸浆车间也在大挖生产潜力的同时，试用自制的小土磨木机来提高生产。此外，他们还计划帮助吉林市附近的人民公社用土法生产纸浆，来供应本厂部分纸浆的需要。
    吉林地区用电量增长很快，电力供应不能满足该厂生产需要，职工们决心用土洋结合的方法自己办电。他们除了着手兴建正规发电站以外，提出：“向一切可利用的能源要电”的口号，广泛利用土透平、旧汽车头、坦克头、飞机头、锅驼机以及下水道水力等种种动力发电。此外，他们还设法办卫星厂生产和回收火碱、毛布、铜网等主要原材料。（附图片）
