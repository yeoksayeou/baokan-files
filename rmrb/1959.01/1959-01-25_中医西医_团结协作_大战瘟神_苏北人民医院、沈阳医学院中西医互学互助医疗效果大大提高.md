Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Unite and Cooperate to Fight the Plague God
    Medical Effectiveness Greatly Improved Through Mutual Learning and Assistance Between Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine at the Subei People's Hospital and Shenyang Medical College
    (Reported by this newspaper)  The Subei People's Hospital in Jiangsu Province has greatly improved its medical effectiveness through the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Many doctors commonly use both traditional Chinese and Western medical techniques to treat patients in clinical practice.  To better facilitate cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the hospital has established a special ward for integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment.  Before treating patients in this ward, the attending physicians of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine must first study the medical records and then hold a consultation.  In the past six months, the hospital has treated more than 200 patients using integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine or both sets of medical techniques.  These were all difficult-to-treat conditions, including sequelae of Japanese encephalitis, cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis, biliary ascariasis, and appendiceal perforation with peritonitis.  When treating a patient's sequelae of Japanese encephalitis, the patient was unable to take Chinese medicine due to being in a coma, so Western medicine doctors used a nasal feeding tube to administer the medicine.  Many Western medicine doctors have learned to use Chinese medicine to treat filariasis and acupuncture to treat appendicitis.
    The Subei People's Hospital began establishing various departments of traditional Chinese medicine in 1953, such as internal medicine, pediatrics, acupuncture, traumatology, hemorrhoids, and qigong.  In recent years, the hospital's Party leadership has resolutely implemented the policy on traditional Chinese medicine, organized Western medicine doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and greatly strengthened unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine.  Many Western medicine doctors have deeply realized the richness and diversity of traditional Chinese medicine in their studies.  Surgeons, seeing the remarkable curative effect of acupuncture in treating tetanus by the hospital's traditional Chinese medicine doctors, invited acupuncture doctors to give them lectures on acupuncture.  Surgeons use acupuncture for pain relief before and after surgery, and many Western medicine internists use acupuncture to treat enteritis, neurasthenia, and other diseases, with very good results.  Many nurses have not only learned acupuncture techniques but also, with the help and guidance of acupuncture doctors, have formulated a relatively complete set of nursing routines based on their own operational experience.  When encountering difficult cases that cannot be resolved with traditional Chinese medicine, they also actively learn from Western medicine.  For example, one patient had a high fever, and after taking several doses of Chinese medicine, the effect was not significant.  After X-ray examination, it was found that the patient was suffering from infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis, and Western medicine doctors were immediately consulted for joint treatment, and the condition quickly improved.  For cases that must be treated surgically, traditional Chinese medicine doctors consult with Western medicine surgeons for surgical treatment.  Many traditional Chinese medicine doctors have begun to use Western medicine methods to diagnose and treat certain diseases.  The traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine doctors in this hospital not only learn from each other in their work, learn from each other's strengths, and always consider the patients, but also generally respect and unite with each other politically.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 23rd. Shenyang Medical College and Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine have established a cooperative relationship of mutual learning and mutual assistance, creating conditions for teachers, students, and medical staff of the two colleges to comprehensively master the theories and medical skills of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine.
    In November of last year, Shenyang Medical College and Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine began close cooperation in teaching and medical treatment to promote the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine selected experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctors to give reports on traditional Chinese medicine clinical experience to teachers, students, and medical staff of Shenyang Medical College, and served as teachers for the college's traditional Chinese medicine training class. The students in this training class are Western medicine doctors studying off-the-job. In the past two months, these traditional Chinese medicine doctors have taught the teachers and medical staff of Shenyang Medical College the experience of traditional Chinese medicine in treating bronchial asthma, hepatitis, high blood pressure, chronic nephritis, bone tuberculosis, and acupuncture techniques.
    Shenyang Medical College has also selected experienced teachers and Western medicine doctors to give lectures at the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and serve as teachers for the college's basic courses. Students in the traditional Chinese medicine training class at Shenyang Medical College also interned at the affiliated hospital of the Liaoning College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. During the internship, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine doctors acted as each other's teachers and apprentices, learning from each other.
    The cooperation between the two colleges has already shown results in promoting the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Western medicine doctors in the traditional Chinese medicine training class at Shenyang Medical College have written dozens of papers expounding the theories of traditional Chinese medicine from a theoretical perspective after interning at the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors at the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine have learned Western medicine and have begun to treat diseases with a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, also achieving satisfactory results. Many medical staff in the affiliated hospitals of Shenyang Medical College have also mastered acupuncture techniques and adopted a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to treat diseases after learning from traditional Chinese medicine.

    中医西医　团结协作　大战瘟神
    苏北人民医院、沈阳医学院中西医互学互助医疗效果大大提高
    本报讯　江苏省苏北人民医院的中、西医团结协作，大大提高了医疗效果。许多医师在临床中常用中、西两套医疗技术替病人治病。为了中西医之间更好地协作，这个医院特设立一个中西医协作治疗的病房。对这个病房的病人治病前，中西医的主治医师都要先研究病历，而后会诊。半年多来，全院中西医协作治疗和用中西医两套医疗技术治好的病人有二百多人。这些病，都是一些难治之症，其中有乙型脑炎后遗症、空洞性肺结核、胆道蛔虫、阑尾穿孔腹膜炎等。在治疗一个病人的乙型脑炎后遗症时，病人昏迷不能服中药，西医就用鼻饲管把药物灌入。许多西医都学会用中药治疗丝虫病，用针灸治疗阑尾炎等。
    苏北人民医院1953年开始先后建立了中医各科如内科、儿科、针灸科、伤科、痔科、气功科等。几年来这个医院党的领导坚决贯彻了中医政策，组织西医学习中医，大大地加强了中西医之间的团结和协作。很多西医在学习中都深刻体会到祖国医学的丰富多彩。外科医生看到这个医院的中医用针灸治疗破伤风有显著的疗效，就请针灸科医师为他们上课学习针灸。外科医生在手术前后用针灸止痛，不少西医内科用针灸治疗肠炎、神经衰弱等疾病，效果都很好。很多护士不仅学会了针灸技术，同时在针灸医师的帮助和指导下，根据本身的操作经验制定了一套比较完整的护理常规。在中医方面遇有解决不了的疑难病例也主动向西医学习，如有一病人发高烧，服中药数贴，效果不显著，经X光检查系患浸润型肺结核，即请西医会诊，共同治疗，病情很快就有好转。凡是一些必须手术治疗的病例，中医都请西医外科会诊，进行手术治疗。有不少中医师已开始运用西医的办法，对某些疾病进行诊断和治疗。这个医院的中、西医不但在业务上能相互学习，取长补短，处处为病人着想，在政治上一般也都能做到互相尊重和团结。　（徐文、朱冰菊）
    新华社沈阳23日电　沈阳医学院和辽宁省中医学院建立互学互助的协作关系，为两个学院的教师、学生和医务人员全面掌握中、西医理论和医疗技能创造了条件。
    去年11月间，沈阳医学院和辽宁省中医学院为促进中西医合流，在教学和医疗上开始密切合作。辽宁省中医学院选派出有丰富医疗经验的中医师向沈阳医学院教师、学生和医务人员作关于中医临床经验的报告，并担任了这个学院的中医训练班的教师，这个训练班的学员是离职学习的西医。两个月来，这些中医医师已经向沈阳医学院的教师和医务人员，传授了中医治疗支气管喘息、肝炎、高血压、慢性肾炎、骨结核等病的经验和针灸技术。
    沈阳医学院也选派有经验的教师和西医到中医学院讲学，并担任这个学院基础课的教师。沈阳医学院中医训练班学员还曾到辽宁省中医学院附属中医院实习。在实习期间，中、西医师就互当教师，互当徒弟，相互学习。
    这两个学院的协作，对促进中西医合流已经显示出效果。沈阳医学院中医训练班的西医在中医学院实习以后，已写出了几十篇从理论上阐述祖国医学的论文。中医学院的中医学习了西医，开始运用中西医兼治疾病，也得到满意的效果。沈阳医学院各附属医院许多医务人员向中医学习以后，也能掌握针灸技术和采用中西药兼治疾病。
