(Our Newspaper Changsha Dispatch, 26th) While vigorously promoting industrial production, Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, actively focused on repair and spare parts work, ensuring the needs of industrial production and people's daily lives.

Last year, Zhuzhou's industry experienced significant development. The number of local factories alone increased from eight in 1957 to one hundred and twenty-nine. With the increase in factories and workers, the tasks of repairing machinery and people's daily necessities increased sharply. After studying this situation in November of last year, the Zhuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made comprehensive arrangements for the city's repair and spare parts work. The Municipal Committee required the repair workshops of the city's ten or so state-owned factories to first ensure the timely completion of their own factory's repair tasks, and then, according to needs and possibilities, trial-produce some products. Among the local industries, seven factories were also selected to be responsible for repair and spare parts work in the heavy industry, light industry, and transportation sectors. A city-wide repair and spare parts network was formed. The Municipal Committee also made specific arrangements for the repair of people's daily necessities (such as bicycles, clocks, and sheet metal utensils). In addition to establishing comprehensive repair factories for bicycles, clocks, and leather shoes in the emerging industrial areas, many daily necessities repair points were added in the urban area. The city added five clock repair points alone.

Subsequently, the Municipal Committee also conducted communist ideological education among the cadres and workers of these repair enterprises, explaining the relationship between repair work and industrial production and people's lives, and explaining that manufacturing and repairing are equally important and equally glorious. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the employees of these units. The Municipal Committee also instructed relevant departments to supply these factories with the necessary raw materials and tools according to needs and possibilities, and helped these factories basically solve the difficulties encountered in their work.

After Zhuzhou City vigorously grasped repair and spare parts work, good results were quickly achieved. For example, the Municipal General Machinery Factory overhauled more than fifty machines for the local heavy industry system, medium-repaired more than seventy machines, and small-repaired one hundred and twenty-five machines in two and a half months. The factory's output value also increased from 20,000 yuan per month to 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. After completing their tasks, some factories also rushed to manufacture urgently needed equipment for fraternal factories and produced a batch of utensils urgently needed for people's lives.

(Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch, 26th) After a group of automobile repair factories in Lanzhou were upgraded to mechanical manufacturing factories, new repair forces were cultivated in a timely manner to meet the needs of the increasingly developing automobile transportation industry.

During last year's Great Leap Forward, Lanzhou's automobile repair factories and automobile parts manufacturing factories innovated technology and manufactured equipment such as three-wheeled automobiles, tractors, and machine tools. At that time, some repair factories were upgraded and became manufacturing factories. Under the situation of continuous leaps and bounds in various undertakings, the automobile transportation industry is also developing rapidly. In 1959, the city's automobile transportation volume will increase by more than 40% compared with last year, and the number of automobiles will also increase significantly. This requires a stronger automobile repair team.

After studying this situation, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant departments adjusted the automobile repair forces while concentrating major efforts on grasping the machinery manufacturing industry. A major automobile repair factory in Lanzhou originally planned to be rebuilt into a tractor manufacturing factory this year. Because this factory has a strong repair force and plays a decisive role in completing the city's automobile overhaul and medium repair tasks this year, the Municipal Committee has rearranged it and cancelled the original upgrade plan. Some automobile repair factories that were originally responsible for the trial production of new products such as automobiles and tractors have now stopped trial production and handed over the tasks to other machinery factories, allowing the repair factories to devote themselves to repair work. The Municipal Committee also transferred a batch of mechanical equipment and hundreds of workers to expand the Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory according to the needs after a large number of new automobiles were added. This year, the city's automobile repair industry will also manufacture more than one hundred locally-made machine tools to equip itself. A workshop for manufacturing automobile parts is also stepping up construction on the basis of self-reliance.

The streets in the city are also cultivating and supplementing repair forces. They use discarded machine tools, use civilian houses as factory buildings, and organize scattered handicraft workers and retired old repair workers on the streets, and let them take apprentices. Without spending a penny of the state's investment, more than twenty automobile repair factories were quickly established. The elderly workers of the city's five automobile transportation teams who are no longer able to be drivers have changed to automobile maintenance and repair work, and have recruited a group of apprentices and established five factories for maintenance and repair of automobiles. In this way, the city's automobile repair capacity this year can increase by more than half compared with last year, which can basically adapt to the development of the automobile transportation industry.

(Our Newspaper Changchun Dispatch, 26th) While manufacturing batches of "Leap Forward 22 Model" diesel engines for the country last year, the Changchun Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Factory actively carried out repair and spare parts work, making both production and repair leaps forward.

The predecessor of the Changchun Internal Combustion Engine Factory was a repair department of the Changchun Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Small Hardware Factory. In the winter of 1957, it could only do some less technically complex internal combustion engine repair and spare parts work. During last year's Great Leap Forward, the workers successfully trial-produced a diesel engine. Later, the Changchun Municipal Industrial Leading Department separated it from the original Small Hardware Factory, added some equipment and labor, and established an internal combustion engine factory independently. In the production process, the employees manufactured and installed twenty-three locally-made machine tools and many special equipment and tools, increasing the production capacity from ten units per month at the beginning of last year to thirty units, becoming a medium-sized internal combustion engine manufacturing factory. From May of last year to now, this factory has produced one hundred and twenty-eight twenty-two horsepower diesel engines, supporting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

After this factory shifted from repair and spare parts to manufacturing, it did not abandon the repair and spare parts business, but strengthened it. After the first diesel engine was successfully trial-produced, some employees wanted to abandon the repair and spare parts business and only engage in manufacturing. They believed that the repair and spare parts business was labor-intensive, occupied a lot of equipment, but the output value was not large, the delivery time was tight, and management was also troublesome. The factory's Party branch once organized employees to hold several debate meetings, debating issues such as "If we don't repair, who will repair," and "Is it okay to only manufacture and not repair." The employees clearly realized that socialist enterprises should not simply pursue profits and convenience, but should serve the needs of the country's comprehensive development of industrial and agricultural production. The employees also realized that repair and manufacturing are of equal importance. Therefore, a repair and spare parts workshop was established at the beginning of the factory, with fixed manpower and equipment. Usually, this workshop specializes in undertaking repair and spare parts business. When encountering repair and spare parts tasks that are technically complex or require urgent delivery, it organizes other workshops to cooperate and carry out repair and spare parts together. Last year, this factory repaired a total of one hundred and sixty-five various diesel engines, tractors, and gasoline engines, which was much more than in 1957. Through manufacturing diesel engines, the workers' technical level has rapidly improved, and various internal combustion engine parts can be manufactured in the factory. The more precise parts such as tile roads, piston rings, and crankshafts that could not be repaired in the past can now also be repaired. Since the second half of last year, this factory has been able to respond to all requests in the repair and spare parts business, ensuring quality.

This year, the factory's internal combustion engine production and repair and spare parts business will continue to expand. The factory is now trial-producing two types of high-speed diesel engines, twenty horsepower and eighteen horsepower. The equipment in the repair and spare parts workshop will also be appropriately increased to undertake more repair and spare parts business. The workers are currently working on manufacturing locally-made machine tools. (Jin Changfan)

    本报长沙26日电　湖南省株洲市在大抓工业生产的同时，积极抓紧修理和配件工作，保证了工业生产和人民日常生活方面的需要。
    去年株洲市的工业有很大发展。仅地方工厂就由1957年的八个增加到一百二十九个。随着工厂和工人的增加，机械和人民生活用品的修配任务骤然增大。中共株洲市委在去年11月间研究这一情况以后，对全市的修理和配件工作作了全面的安排。市委要求全市十来个国营工厂的修配车间，首先要保证及时完成本厂的修配任务，然后才根据需要和可能，试制一部分产品。在地方工业中，也选定了七个厂子，分别担负重工业、轻工业、交通运输等部门的修理和配件的工作。全市形成了一个修配网。对人民日常生活用品（如自行车、钟表、白铁类用具）的修配工作，市委也作了具体安排。除在新兴的工业区成立了自行车、钟表、皮鞋等综合修理工厂外，还在市区增设了许多日用品修配点，全市仅钟表修理点就增加了五个。
    接着，市委又在这些修配企业的干部和工人中进行了共产主义思想教育，说明修配工作和工业生产、人民生活的关系，说明制造和修理同等重要同样光荣，因而大大激发了这些单位职工们的积极性。市委还指示有关部门根据需要和可能，供应这些厂所必需的原料和工具，帮助这些厂基本上解决了在工作中遇到的困难。
    株洲市大抓修理和配件工作以后，很快就收到良好效果。如市通用机械厂在两个半月内，为地方重工业系统的机器大修了五十多台次，中修了七十多台次，小修了一百二十五台次；这个厂的产值，也由每月二万元，提高到四、五万元。部分厂在完成任务以后，还为兄弟厂赶制了一部分急需的设备，生产了一批人民生活迫切需要的用具。

    本报兰州26日电　兰州市在一批汽车修理厂升级为机械制造厂以后，及时培植新的修理力量，来满足日益发展的汽车运输事业的需要。
    在去年的大跃进中，兰州的汽车修理工厂和制造汽车零件的工厂，革新技术，制造出三轮汽车、拖拉机、机床等设备。当时有一部分修理工厂升级，变成了制造工厂。在各项事业不断跃进的形势下，汽车运输事业也在急速发展。1959年全市汽车运输量将比去年增加40％多，汽车数量也要大大增加。这就需要有一支更强大的汽车修理队伍。
    中共兰州市委和有关部门研究这一情况以后，在集中主要力量抓机器制造业的同时，调整了修理汽车的力量。兰州市一家主要的汽车修理厂，今年原来计划要改建成拖拉机制造厂，因为这家工厂的修理力量强，对今年全市汽车大、中修任务的完成有决定作用，因此市委已重行安排，取消了原来的升级计划。本来要担负汽车、拖拉机等新产品试制任务的一些汽车修理厂，现在已停止试制，把任务交给别的机械厂担负，让修理工厂全力从事修理工作。市委还抽调了一批机械设备和数百名工人，按照增加大批新汽车后的需要，扩建了兰州市汽车修理厂。全市汽车修理业今年还要制造一百台以上的土机床，用来装备自己；一个制汽车零件的车间也在自力更生的基础上加紧建设。
    市内各街道也在培养和补充修理力量。他们利用废旧机床，以民房为厂房，把散居在街道上的手工业工人和退休的老修理工组织起来，由他们带学徒。没有花国家一块钱的投资，就迅速办起了二十多个汽车修理工厂。全市五个汽车运输队的年老不能当驾驶员的工人，已经改做汽车保养和修理工作，并且招收了一批学徒，兴办了五个保养和修理汽车的工厂。这样，全市今年的汽车修理能力可比去年增加一半以上，基本上能与汽车运输事业的发展相适应。　（郭汾祥）
    本报长春26日电　长春内燃机制造厂去年在为国家制造成批“跃进22型”柴油机的同时，积极进行了修配工作，使生产和修配双双跃进。
    长春内燃机厂的前身是长春市手工业生产联社小五金厂的一个修理部，1957年冬还只能做些技术不太复杂的内燃机修配工作。去年大跃进中，工人们试制成功了一台柴油机。后来，长春市工业领导部门便把它从原来的小五金厂划出来，增加一些设备和劳动力，单独成立了一个内燃机厂。职工们在生产过程中，自己动手制造和装设了二十三台土机床以及许多专门设备、工具，使生产能力从去年年初月产十台提高到三十台，成了一座中型内燃机制造厂。从去年5月到现在，这个厂已经生产了一百二十八台二十二马力柴油机，支援了工农业生产大跃进。
    这个厂由修配转向制造以后，并没有扔掉修配业务，而是加强了。第一台柴油机试制成功后，有些职工想要扔掉修配业务，只搞制造。他们认为，修配业务费工，占用设备多，但产值不大，交货时间紧，管理也麻烦。厂党支部曾经组织职工举行了几次辩论会，辩论了“我们不修理由谁来修理”、“光制造不修配行不行”等问题，职工们明确认识到社会主义企业不应该单纯追求利润和图方便，应该为国家工农业生产全面发展的需要服务。职工们同时认识到，修配和制造具有同等重要意义。因此，在建厂之初就成立了一个修配车间，固定人力和设备。平常这个车间专门承做修配业务，遇到技术性复杂或交货时间紧迫的修配任务，便组织其他车间协作，共同进行修配。去年，这个厂共修配了各种柴油机、拖拉机、汽油机一百六十五台，比1957年增加很多。通过制造柴油机，工人技术水平迅速提高，同时各种内燃机部件都可以在本厂制造，过去所不能修配的瓦路、活塞环、曲轴等较精密的部件，现在也可以修配了。从去年下半年起，这个厂在修配业务上已经做到了有求必应，保证质量。
    今年这个厂的内燃机生产和修配业务将继续扩大。这个厂现在正在试制二十马力和十八马力的两种高速柴油机。修配车间的设备也将适当增加，以便承担更多的修配业务。工人们目前正在着手制造土洋结合的机床。　（金昌范）
