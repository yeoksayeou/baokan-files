Lieutenant General Zhang Caiqian was assigned to the Sixth Company as a soldier for just two days when the unit began a continuous 600-li (approximately 300 km) marching exercise. During the march, the general carried the same amount of equipment as all the soldiers in the company. He hadn't walked far when his feet developed blisters that bled. But he didn't say a word and kept up with the column. During breaks, the medic checked the soldiers' feet. When it was Lieutenant General Zhang Caiqian's turn, he held his feet in his hands, repeatedly saying, "I'm fine, I'm fine!" He urged the medic to quickly check his other comrades. At this moment, the instructor arrived. The lieutenant general had no choice but to take off his shoes and allow the examination. The medic applied medicine to his feet, and he continued to march with the column.

At five o'clock on the morning of the ninth day, the troops began to seize the "enemy's" position. As soon as the artillery barrage began, the general jumped forward in one breath to the assault starting point. Then, closely following the squad leader, he charged towards the "enemy's" position. There was a small mound on the "enemy's" second trench, and he was about to run over it when he encountered a "enemy" artillery barrage. The soldier, Shuai Haiming, who was tasked with blasting the "enemy's" strongpoint, was also prevented from advancing. If the "enemy's" strongpoint was not destroyed, the troops could not advance. The general suddenly leaped up, ran a few steps quickly, and occupied the mound. Then, he shouted to Shuai Haiming: "Advance quickly, I'll cover you!"

Continuous rain made the road muddy and very difficult to walk. The general's trouser legs were all wet, and his socks were filled with mud. But he still stayed with the squad, rushing to the front of the "enemy's" third trench. The "enemy" was still resisting stubbornly. He used the concealment of the terrain and objects, crawling from under the highway. Just as he was about to use a bridgehead to shoot, the troops suddenly launched an attack. He climbed up and ran forward. This place was too steep, and he almost fell into the river. "Be careful!" his comrades told him. He said: "It's nothing! I want to participate in the entire thirty-plus li attack from beginning to end!"

    行军道上
    张才千中将分配在第六连当兵刚两天，部队就开始连续六百里路的行军演习。行军途中，将军和全连战士们背着同样多的行装。没有走多久，他的脚磨起了泡，出了血。但他不啃声，照样跟着队伍走。休息时，卫生员给战士检查脚，轮到张才千中将时，他两手抱着脚，连声说：“好好的，好好的！”并催卫生员赶快给别的战友检查。这时候，指导员来了。中将没有办法，只好把鞋子脱下来听凭检查。卫生员给他的脚上擦了药，他又跟着队伍前进。
    第九天的早晨五点钟，部队开始抢占“敌人”的阵地。炮火急袭一开始，将军就一口气跃进到冲击出发地点。然后，紧紧地跟着班长，向“敌人”阵地冲去。在“敌人”第二道堑壕上有一个小坆包，他正想跑过去，却遇到了“敌人”炮火的封锁。执行爆破“敌人”支撑点任务的战士帅海明，也被阻止住了不能前进。不炸掉“敌人”这个支撑点，部队就不能前进。将军猛然跃起，飞快地跑了几步，占领了坆包。接着，他向帅海明喊道：“快前进，我掩护你！”
    连绵的大雨，使道路满布泥泞，非常难走。将军的裤管全湿了，袜子里也灌满了泥水。可是他仍然和全班在一起，冲到“敌人”第三道堑壕的前沿。“敌人”还在顽抗，他利用地形地物的隐蔽，从公路下边爬过来，正想利用一个桥头进行射击，忽然部队发起冲锋了。他爬起来就向前跑去。这地方太陡，差一点掉到河里去。“你要小心点！”同志们嘱咐他。他说：“没有什么！三十多里的进攻，我要全部参加到底！”
