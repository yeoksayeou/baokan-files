    Commodity Production Brings Prosperity
    —A Visit to Huangqiao Commune on the Eve of the New Year
    By Our Reporters Zhang Jing, Jiang Weicai, Bao Chunguang

    A Lively Small Market Town
    We arrived at the Huangqiao People's Commune in Wuxian, Jiangsu Province, on the last two days of 1958. The commune office is located in Huangtuqiao. Although this is a very small market town, it has become particularly lively these days. The cloth shops, department stores, and non-staple food stores on both sides of the small street are displaying a variety of commodities.

    Before eight o'clock, the supply and marketing department was already crowded with customers. They carefully selected, admired, and commented on each commodity. If you stay here for a while, you will find that quite a few customers buy twenty or thirty yuan worth of goods at once. When the commune members come, they come empty-handed; when they leave, they are carrying and holding, big bags and small packages, one package after another.

    The Huangqiao Commune Supply and Marketing Department has seven supply and marketing branches, located in seven production brigades. These days, each branch is so busy that its turnover has doubled and increased continuously.

    Later, we learned that the commune had just completed its distribution. The personal income of the commune members increased by more than 30% compared to last year. In 1957, the average per capita income was sixty yuan; in 1958, it increased to eighty-one yuan. Even after deducting food expenses, each person could still receive more than twenty-seven yuan. Therefore, everyone wants to buy some nice clothes and accessories at this time.

    Although the supply and marketing department has a cash income of several thousand yuan every day, the 80,000 yuan of personal savings that the commune members have deposited in the credit cooperative has not been touched at all.

    Why is the economic life of this commune so active? Let's look back at their production!

    Large Ponds, Fat Fish
    In 1958, the Huangqiao Commune achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture and fisheries. The per unit yield of grain was more than 860 catties, and the per unit yield of fish was 800 catties. The nationally renowned fish-producing area, Beizhuangji, is also in this commune.

    Comrade Zhu Xinfu, the commune director, took us for a walk around the fish ponds. Here, it is truly another world. On hundreds of acres of land, fish ponds with clear blue water are scattered like clouds. As Comrade Zhu Xinfu led us along the winding pond dikes, he told us enthusiastically that such large areas of fish ponds are in almost every brigade. These fish ponds occupy a total of 8,870 mu, which is exactly half of the grain cultivated area. In addition to fish fry, more than 6,800 dan of fertilizer fish have been caught throughout the year, and more than 10,000 dan of fish are still being caught one after another. Only then did we feel that this is truly worthy of the name "land of fish and rice"!

    We came to a fish pond, and seven or eight commune members on both sides of the pond dike were pulling a net to catch fish. As they pulled, the net became tighter and tighter, heavier and heavier. At the end, we only saw countless white carp flashing silver scales in the sunlight at the bottom of the net. The newly caught grass carp frantically beat their thick tails in the cabin, making the bottom of the boat thump. It turned out that in order to supply the needs of non-staple foods in various cities, the commune members were catching fish intensively these days. It is said that on New Year's Day, 800 dan of fish will be transported to Suzhou to allow workers, cadres, and residents to celebrate the New Year. Vigorously developing fishery production not only supplied the needs of the domestic market and completed the national export tasks, but also enlivened the economic life of the commune. Fish farming alone brought in a total income of 1,876,600 yuan for the entire commune. The 40,000 yuan of basic construction costs for the commune's newly built steel plant, cement plant, and machinery plant were paid from this income.

    Women's Contribution
    A cargo ship was moored under the Pujiaqiao bridge in the commune, loaded with large bundles and small packages of rags. At first glance, it looks like cotton bales being transported to a textile factory. These are the raw materials for pasting "stiffeners."

    Across the bridge, to the north, is a row of bungalows. Inside, there are many women who skillfully use their hands, covered with paste, to cut those scraps of cloth into squares or strips, and then paste them into two layers of "stiffeners." Their movements are just like skilled chefs making pancakes. With a smear of paste, they pick up a piece of cloth, cut and paste it, and a "stiffener" is made.

    What is the impact of producing these "stiffeners" on people's economic lives? With this question in mind, we walked into the office of the workshop. The young accountant, Jiang Xiaodi, enthusiastically introduced the production of "stiffeners" to us while taking out a large bundle of letters from the drawer for us to see. These letters came from Hunan, Henan, Hebei, and Shanghai, and some were orders, some were urging delivery. Almost every letter had these words: "Please deliver quickly," "Please provide strong support," "The more the better"… etc. Some wanted to order thousands of sheets, some wanted to order tens of thousands of sheets; some were for the needs of the local people, some were for the needs of export commodities. Jiang Xiaodi said with a smile: "We not only receive such letters every day, but the office is often full of guests." Since October, more than 100 people have been sent directly to order goods. The commune has produced 850,000 "stiffeners" in three months, and it is still in short supply. The sales areas include Suzhou, Wuxi, Xuzhou and other cities within the province, as well as shoe factories, hat factories, rubber factories, clothing stores, and retail stores in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Shanghai. This "stiffener," pasted together with scraps of cloth, actually has such a broad sales market, which we did not expect.

    What surprised us even more was that the development of this sideline industry was almost entirely self-reliant. The commune hardly invested any money, only allocated a few rooms. In just three months, hundreds of thousands of "stiffeners" were produced, with a total output value of more than 160,000 yuan. After deducting production costs and all expenses, there was a net surplus of 80,000 yuan. This wealth greatly increased the commune's cash income and enlivened the economic life of the commune members. Of the 130,000 yuan in cash distributed this time, 60,000 yuan was the income from the "stiffener" sideline industry.

    Raise More Pigs to Support the City
    The commune's pig breeding farm also has a great attraction. Walking into the breeding farm, a row of newly built pigsties are cleaned up everywhere. The fat-headed and big-eared sows are raised round and plump. A group of piglets grow up like meat balls, desperately burrowing into the sow's arms to suckle. Seeing these fat pigs, it is hard to believe that they have only been raised for half a year.

    There are eight such pig breeding farms in the entire commune, one in each production brigade.

    This commune had no pig-raising habits and no pig-raising experience. In 1957, many of the pigs raised died, so some people lost heart and advocated not raising or raising less. In May, the township Party committee specifically studied the issue of pig raising, criticized the reliance on external supplies and the fear of difficulties among some cadres and the masses, resolutely adopted the method of self-breeding and self-raising, sent more than 20 people to other places to purchase more than 100 sows and a batch of piglets, built more than 200 pig houses, and selected more than 50 cadres and commune members with pig-raising experience to specialize in pig-raising work. Since then, pig-raising, this sideline production, has rapidly developed throughout the township. The pigs that were bought were very thin, and many breeders slept next to the pigsties, taking care of them carefully day and night. Now, the entire commune has developed to 600 sows, and more than 500 piglets have been bred in the past six months. While breeding pigs, the 82 canteens in the entire commune also raised a batch of meat pigs.

    The development of the pig-raising sideline industry has finally changed the past situation of relying solely on external supplies, allowing commune members to eat pork regularly. During the busy season of autumn harvest and autumn planting, the commune slaughtered a lot of pigs, and also sold more than 300 fat pigs to the state and supplied them to the local market, increasing sideline income by more than 9,000 yuan.

    The commune is also developing embroidery, board brushes, grass bag weaving, straw shoes, and chicken, duck, sheep, rabbit and other sideline industries. The embroidery girls here are also clever, both rough and fine. In 1958, when agricultural and fishery production was very tight, they still squeezed out time to process more than 200 embroidered quilt covers and more than 500 pairs of cushions for the country, meeting export needs and increasing the commune's income by more than 32,000 yuan. The commune also plans to use its own fish fry to exchange for a large number of chicks and ducklings from neighboring communes to develop the sideline industry of raising chickens and ducks.

    The Words of the Party Secretary
    Although they have actively developed fishery and sideline production, they have not neglected the development of agricultural production. The labor force they used in sideline production only accounted for 8.3% of the total labor force, and the labor force used in fishery production only accounted for 17%. 50% of the commune's strong labor force was invested in water conservancy projects and field management. In 1958, they achieved grain self-sufficiency for the first time and also paid more than 3 million catties of public grain. In 1959, they also plan to have a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry, and sideline industries, producing more grain and non-staple foods for the country and urban people.

    The prosperous scene of the Huangqiao Commune allows us to see the positive impact of the combination of the commune's self-sufficient production and commodity production on the commune's economic life. Commodity production under the unified plan and leadership of the commune has not led to the flooding of capitalism. On the contrary, it has become a positive factor in supporting the country, supporting the city, and supporting agriculture.

    Comrade Fan Naiji, the secretary of the commune Party committee, has a deep understanding of this. He said:

    "Before communization, we were once eroded by capitalist ideas, and production was in a backward state. After communization, we continued to develop commodity production, but we are no longer afraid of the disasters of capitalism. Because we have three magic weapons in our hands. The first is to clarify who we are serving and to find the direction for developing commodity production. Our current commodity production is to serve agricultural production, to meet the needs of urban people's lives, and to serve the country's export tasks. The second is the unified leadership and unified plan of the commune. The third is that the socialist consciousness of the commune members has been raised. With these three magic weapons, we can fully utilize its positive factors." Finally, he added with full confidence: "In the past, we developed fishery production under the unified plan of the state. Recently, we have also developed sideline production under the leadership of the commune. In the future, we will continue to advance along this correct track to make our commune more prosperous and more thriving."

    商品生产带来一片繁荣
    ——新年前夕访黄桥公社
    本报记者　张竞　姜韦才　鲍春光
    热闹的小集镇
    1958年的最后两天，我们来到了江苏吴县黄桥人民公社。公社办公室设在黄土桥。虽然这是个很小的集镇，这些日子却变得特别热闹。小街两旁的布店、百货店和副食品店里，陈列着各种各样的商品。
    不到八点钟，供销门市部里已经挤满了顾客。他们对每一种商品都仔细地挑选、欣赏和评论。只要在这里呆上一会，你就会发现一下子买掉二三十元的顾客可真不少。社员们来的时候，空着双手；走的时候，都是提着抱着，大包小包，一包又一包。
    黄桥公社供销门市部有七个供销分部，分设在七个生产大队里。这几天，每个分部都是这样地繁忙，营业额一翻再翻，增加不已。
    后来我们才了解，这个公社刚刚分配结束。社员个人收入比去年增加了30％以上。1957年每人平均是六十元，1958年每人增加到八十一元。就是除去伙食，每人还可分到二十七元多。所以，大家都要在这个时候添置一些漂亮的穿的戴的。
    尽管供销部每天有几千元的现金收入，社员在信用部存的八万元个人储蓄却还是一点没动。
    这个公社的经济生活为什么这样活跃呢？让我们回过头来看看他们的生产吧！
    塘大鱼肥
    1958年，黄桥公社在农业和渔业上都获得了空前的大丰收。粮食单产八百六十多斤，鱼单产八百斤。全国闻名的产鱼地——北庄基，也就在这个公社里。
    公社社长朱新福同志带我们到鱼池上走了一趟。这里，真是别有一个天地。几百亩成片的土地上，像云块似的散布着一个个碧水澄清的鱼池。朱新福同志一面引我们在曲折的池埂上走，一面兴致勃勃地告诉我们，像这样大片大片的鱼池，几乎在每个大队都有。全公社这些鱼池共占地八千八百七十亩，恰好是粮食耕地面积的一半。除鱼种外，全年已打了六千八百多担肥鱼，还有一万多担鱼正在陆续打捞。我们这才亲切地感到，这里才真是名副其实的“鱼米之乡”哩！
    我们来到了一个鱼池边，两面池埂上有七、八个社员在拉网捕鱼，他们边拉边走，网越拉越紧，越拉越重，拉到尽头，只看见网底里无数条白色的鲤鱼在阳光下闪动着银鳞。刚离水的青鱼，在船舱里拼命拍动着肥厚的尾巴，打得船底扑扑的响。原来，社员们为了供应各地城市的副食品需要，这两天突击捕鱼。据说元旦这一天，就要打八百担鱼运往苏州市，给工人、干部和居民欢度新年。大力发展渔业生产，不但供应了国内市场的需要，完成了国家出口任务，同时也活跃了公社的经济生活。单是养鱼一项，全公社就收入一百八十七万六千六百多元。公社新办的钢铁厂、水泥厂和机械厂所用的四万元基本建设费用，就是在这笔收入里支出的。
    妇女的贡献
    在公社的濮家桥下停靠的一只货船，装满了大捆小包破布。乍一看很像运到纺织厂的棉花包。这就是糊“硬衬”的原料。
    过了桥，向北有一排平房，里面有许多妇女，用一双双粘满浆糊的手，敏捷地将那些碎布剪成方方或条条，再糊成两层厚的“硬衬”。她们的动作，简直像熟练的厨师做煎饼一样，浆糊一抹，顺手拿起布块，一剪一贴，一张“硬衬”就出来了。
    生产这些“硬衬”，对人们的经济生活究竟有多大的作用呢？我们带着这个疑问走进了工场的办公室。年青的会计蒋小弟一面热情地向我们介绍“硬衬”生产情况，一面从抽屉里拿出了一大扎子信给我们看。这些信来自湖南、河南、河北和上海等地，有的是订货，有的是敦促交货，几乎每一封信都有这些的字句：“请迅速交货”、“请大力支援”、“愈多愈好”……等等。有的要订几千张，有的要订几万张；有的为着本地人民的需要，有的为着出口商品需要。蒋小弟笑着说：“我们不仅天天接到这样的来信，而且办公室里还常常高朋满座。”10月份以来，各地直接派人来订货的就有一百多人次。公社三个月来已生产了八十五万张“硬衬”，还是供不应求。销售的地区除本省境内的苏州、无锡、徐州等城市外，还有湖南、湖北、河南、河北、山东、安徽和上海等省市的鞋厂、帽厂、橡胶厂、服装商店和零售商店等。这个用碎布块粘糊起来的“硬衬”，竟然有如此广阔的销售市场，倒是我们原来想像不到的。
    更使我们惊讶的，是这一种副业的发展，几乎完全是白手起家的。公社里几乎没有花一点投资，只是拨了几间房子，仅仅三个月的时间，就生产了几十万张“硬衬”，总产值竟达十六万元以上。除了生产费用和一切开支外，净余八万元。这一笔财富大大增加了公社的现金收入，活跃了社员的经济生活。在这次分配的十三万元现金中，就有六万元是“硬衬”副业的收入。
    多养猪支援城市
    公社里的生猪繁殖场，也有着很大的吸引力。走进繁殖场，一排新盖的猪圈，到处都收拾的干净利落。肥头大耳的老母猪，养得圆滚滚的。一群群小猪，长得简直像个肉团子，一个劲地钻在母猪怀里吃奶。看到这些肥猪群，真不信这是半年内才饲养起来的。
    像这样的生猪繁殖场，全公社即有八个，每个生产大队都有一个。
    这个公社向无养猪习惯，也没有养猪经验，1957年养了一批猪死亡很多，于是有些人就打退堂鼓，主张不养或少养。5月里，乡党委专门研究了养猪问题，批判了一部分干部和群众中存在的依赖外地供应和畏难思想，坚决采取了自繁自养的办法，派了二十多人到外地采购了百多头母猪和一批小猪，建造起二百多间猪房，并选派五十多个有养猪经验的干部和社员专门从事养猪工作。自此，养猪这个副业生产就迅速在全乡开展。买来的猪很瘦，许多饲养员睡在猪圈旁边，日夜细心地照顾。现在全公社的母猪已经发展到六百头，半年来已繁殖小猪五百多头。在繁殖生猪的同时，全公社八十二个食堂还饲养了一批肉猪。
    养猪副业的发展，终于改变了过去单纯依靠外地供应的情况，使社员可经常吃到猪肉。在秋收秋种紧张阶段，社内就宰了不少猪，同时还售给国家和供应本地市场三百多头肥猪，增加了九千多元副业收入。
    现在这个公社里正在发展的还有刺绣、板刷、编草包、草鞋和鸡、鸭、羊、兔等副业。这里的刺绣姑娘也是心灵手巧，能粗能细，在1958年农渔业生产十分紧张的时候，还挤空子为国家加工了二百多条绣花被面和五百多对靠垫，满足了出口需要，给公社增加了三万二千多元的收入。公社还准备用自己的鱼种和邻近的公社换回大批小鸡小鸭，发展养鸡养鸭的副业。
    党委书记的话
    虽然，他们这样积极地发展了渔业和副业生产，但是，他们并没有忽视了农业生产的发展。他们在副业生产上所占用的劳动力，总共只有全部劳力的8.3％，用于渔业生产的劳力，也只占17％。全公社50％的强劳力都投入了水利工程和田间管理工作。1958年他们第一次实现了粮食自给，还缴了三百多万斤公粮。1959年，他们还准备来一个农、渔、牧、副全面大跃进，给国家和城市人民生产更多的粮食和副食品。
    黄桥公社这一片繁荣的景象，使我们看到了公社的自给性生产和商品性生产的结合，给公社的经济生活所带来的积极的影响。在公社统一计划统一领导下的商品性生产，并没有导致资本主义的泛滥，相反的，却成了支援国家、支援城市和支援农业的积极因素。
    公社党委书记范乃积同志对这一点深有体会。他说：
      “公社化以前，我们曾一度受资本主义思想的侵蚀，生产处于落后状态。公社化以后，我们继续发展商品生产，但我们已经不怕资本主义的灾害了。因为我们手里有了三个法宝。第一是明确了为谁服务的，找到了发展商品生产的方向。我们现在的商品生产是为农业生产服务，为满足城市人民生活需要服务，为国家出口任务服务。第二是公社的统一领导和统一计划。第三是社员的社会主义觉悟提高了。有了这三个法宝，我们就可以充分利用它的积极因素。”最后他又满怀信心地补了一句：“过去我们在国家统一计划下发展了渔业生产，最近又在公社领导下发展了副业生产，今后我们还要沿着这条正确的轨道前进，使我们的公社更加繁荣，更加兴旺。”
