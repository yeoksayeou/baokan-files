Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch: The influential Japanese newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" told its readers in a column titled "How Will Life Be This Year?" on the 4th: "Everything is going to rise in price, so cut down on household expenses!"

The newspaper said that it was already difficult to reduce income tax a little, but train fares, bus fares, gas bills, and electricity bills were all going to rise. The newspaper cited an example that a family of three with a total annual income of 500,000 yen would have 9,250 yen deducted from the original 25,677 yen of income tax payable, but the train fares of seven private railways would increase by 17%, and the fares of 47 bus companies would increase by 10%. In addition, general consumer goods, land rent, housing rent, tuition fees, etc., will all rise accordingly.

"Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that more than half of Japan's total population of over 90 million are low-income working people. They do not receive the "benevolence" of tax cuts, but only suffer from rising prices. The newspaper further pointed out that the Japanese government's "White Paper on Welfare" and "White Paper on Living" also acknowledge that the gap between the rich and the poor among the Japanese people has widened. This year, this disparity will further expand.

In the same column, "Asahi Shimbun" also published a satirical cartoon depicting a housewife receiving a "gift" with "tax cut" written on it from the right, and also receiving a "gift" with "price increase" written on it from the left. This simple cartoon powerfully exposed the deceptive nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government's promise to the Japanese people of a 52.5 billion yen tax cut in the 1959 budget. (Attached picture)

### 未受减低赋税之惠　大吃物价上涨之亏  日本人民生活越来越苦

    未受减低赋税之惠　大吃物价上涨之亏
    日本人民生活越来越苦
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本有影响的报纸“朝日新闻”4日在“今年生活怎样？”的专栏里对它的读者说：“什么东西都要涨价，压缩家庭开支吧！”
    这家报纸说，好容易才减了一点点所得税，但是火车费、公共汽车费、瓦斯费和电费都要涨价。报纸举例说，一个每年总收入五十万日元的三口之家，虽然将要在旧有的应纳所得税二万五千六百七十七日元中减去九千二百五十日元，但是，七家私营铁路的火车运费将要增加17％，四十七家公共汽车公司的运费将要增加10％，此外，一般消费品、地租、房租、学费等都要随之涨价。
    “朝日新闻”指出，在超过九千万的日本总人口中，有半数以上是收入低的劳动人民，他们受不到减税的“恩惠”，只是受到物价上涨的苦痛。报纸进一步指出，日本政府发表的“厚生白皮书”和“生活白皮书”也承认日本国民的贫富之间的距离已经扩大。今年，这种贫富悬殊将进一步扩大。
    在同一个专栏里，“朝日新闻”还登载了一幅讽刺漫画，画着一位家庭主妇从右面接到写着“减税”的“礼物”，同时也从左面接到写着“涨价”的“礼物”。这幅寥寥几笔的漫画有力地揭穿了岸信介政府在1959年度预算中向日本国民许下减税五百二十五亿日元诺言的欺骗性。（附图片）
