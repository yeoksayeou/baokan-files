    There is a reservoir east of the village
    There is a reservoir east of the village,
    Where you can see the shadows of flying birds.
    Kind girl,
    Is that your mirror?
    There is a terraced field west of the village,
    Where you can touch the stars on the horizon.
    Happiness,
    Is that the ladder you came down to earth on?
                (Dai folk song)

    村东有一个水库村东有一个水库，可以瞧见飞鸟的影子。善良的姑娘啊，那是不是你的镜子？村西有一架梯田，可以碰到天边的星子。幸福啊，那是不是你来到人间的梯子？
                （傣族民歌）
