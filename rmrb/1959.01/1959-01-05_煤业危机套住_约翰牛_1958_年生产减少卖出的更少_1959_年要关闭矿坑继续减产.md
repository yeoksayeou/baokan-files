Xinhua News Agency, London, January 3rd: According to preliminary statistics announced by the British Ministry of Power on January 1st, Britain's coal production for the fifty-two weeks of 1958 was 215,782,100 tons, a decrease of 7,845,800 tons compared to 1957, representing a decline of 3.5%. Britain's coal production in 1958 was the lowest in the past decade, nearly 10 million tons lower than the average annual coal production of the nine years from 1949 to 1957, about 14 million tons lower than the peak annual production of 1952 after the war, and more than 28 million tons lower than Britain's coal production in 1937.

The deterioration of the British coal industry crisis in 1958 was due to the capitalist economic crisis, which greatly reduced coal consumption in various industrial sectors of Britain. At the same time, coal exports also decreased, resulting in a serious so-called "overproduction" crisis. According to the "Financial Times" estimate, Britain's coal consumption in 1958 decreased by about 10 million tons compared to 1957, with domestic market consumption falling by about 7 million tons and exports falling by about 3 million tons. Faced with shrinking domestic and foreign markets, the British National Coal Board cancelled the Saturday work shifts for each coal mine in 1958, resulting in a decrease of about 8 million tons in coal production.

However, despite this, the serious situation of "overproduction" has not eased in the slightest. Unsold coal is still piled up like mountains in open-pit mines, mine entrances, railway stations, and coal storage stations across Britain. As of November 22nd, the National Coal Board had 18,880,000 tons of unsold coal, an increase of 10 million tons compared to 1957, and the total inventory of coal had reached a historically unprecedented peak of 37,960,000 tons. Currently, coal inventories are still growing at a rate of 300,000 tons per week. According to the "Financial Times" estimate, the National Coal Board's unsold coal will exceed 22 million tons by the end of March next year, which the Coal Board considers to be the maximum limit.

More than one-third of the British National Coal Board's capital expenditure in 1958 was used to store unsold coal. Due to insufficient income, the Coal Board has had to borrow heavily. In view of the severity of the coal industry crisis, the British government has decided to increase the limit of loans that the Coal Board can withdraw in the current fiscal year. This allows British monopoly capital to shift the losses caused by the stagnation of coal sales onto British taxpayers.

To get out of the predicament, the National Coal Board plans to further reduce coal production to 203 million tons in 1959, a further reduction of 12 million tons compared to 1958, and a reduction of 20 million tons compared to 1957. To this end, the Coal Board has decided that in 1959, in addition to closing the twenty coal pits where coal reserves have been exhausted, it will also close another thirty-six coal pits, of which six mines in Wales will be closed on February 1st, 1959. Most of these dozens of mines are located in the so-called "long-term unemployment areas" where unemployment is already very serious. Therefore, even the mouthpiece of the British financial groups, "The Economist" magazine, cannot help but worryingly point out that the closure of mines will make the government's "relationship with labor deteriorate to an unmanageable point."

In addition, the British National Coal Board is also preparing to lower the price of coal in 1959 in order to expand exports to Western Europe and compete with American coal. However, Western Europe itself also experienced a serious "overproduction" crisis in coal in 1958. Therefore, Britain's increase in coal exports will only intensify the contradictions between capitalist countries in the competition for coal sales markets.

### 煤业危机套住“约翰牛”  1958年生产减少卖出的更少  1959年要关闭矿坑继续减产

    煤业危机套住“约翰牛”
    1958年生产减少卖出的更少
    1959年要关闭矿坑继续减产
    新华社伦敦3日电　根据英国动力部1日宣布的初步统计数字，英国1958年五十二个星期的煤产量是二亿一千五百七十八万二千一百吨，比1957年的煤产量下降了七百八十四万五千八百吨，即下降了3.5％。1958年英国的煤产量是十年来最低的产量，比1949年至1957年九年中煤的平均年产量下降了将近一千万吨，比战后年产量最高的1952年下降了约一千四百万吨，比1937年英国的煤产量下降了两千八百万吨以上。
    1958年英国煤业危机的恶化是由于资本主义经济危机使得英国各工业部门的用煤量都大大减少，同时，煤的出口量也减少了，结果造成了严重的所谓生产“过剩”的危机。据“金融时报”估计，1958年英国煤的消费量比1957年减少了约一千万吨，其中国内市场的消费量下降了约七百万吨，出口下降了约三百万吨。在国内外市场日益缩小的情况下，英国国家煤业局在1958年取消了各煤矿每星期六的工作班，因而使煤产量下降了约八百万吨。
    但是，尽管如此，生产“过剩”的严重情况并没有丝毫缓和，卖不出去的煤在英国各地的露天矿场、煤坑口、火车站和储煤站依然堆积如山。截至11月22日，国家煤业局卖不出去的煤已经达到一千八百八十八万吨，比1957年增加了一千万吨，煤的全部存货量已经达到三千七百九十六万吨这一历史上空前的高峰。目前煤的存货量还在以每周三十万吨的速度继续增长。据“金融时报”估计，国家煤业局的滞销煤到明年3月底将超过二千二百万吨，这是煤业局认为是最大限度的数字。
    英国国家煤业局1958年的资本支出中有三分之一以上都用于储存滞销煤。由于入不敷出，煤业局不得不大量举债。鉴于煤业危机严重，英国政府已经决定在本财政年度中提高煤业局可以提取的贷款的限额。这样就使得英国垄断资本得以把煤的滞销所带来的亏损转嫁到英国纳税人身上。
    为了摆脱困境，国家煤业局打算在1959年把煤的生产进一步缩减到两亿零三百万吨，即比1958年再减少一千二百万吨，比1957年减少二千万吨。为此，煤业局决定，在1959年，除了把煤炭蕴藏量已经枯竭的二十个煤坑停闭以外，还要再关闭三十六个煤坑，其中威尔士的六个矿坑在1959年2月1日即将关闭。这几十个矿坑大部分都分布在失业情况本来已经十分严重的所谓“长期失业地区”，因此，就连英国金融集团的喉舌--“经济学家”杂志也不能不担心地指出，关闭矿坑将使得政府“同劳工的关系恶化到难以收拾的地步”。
    此外，英国国家煤业局还准备在1959年降低煤的价格以便扩大向西欧的出口，同美国煤进行竞争。但是，西欧本身在1958年也同样存在着严重的煤产量“过剩”危机，因此，英国增加煤的出口将只能使得资本主义国家在争夺煤的销售市场方面矛盾激烈化。（附图片）
