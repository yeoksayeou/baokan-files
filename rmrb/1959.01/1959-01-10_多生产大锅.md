Consumers' words:

    Produce More Large Woks
    Our village's collective mess hall provides meals for hundreds of people. A few days ago, the bottom of the large iron wok used for cooking rice in the mess hall fell out, and people were sent everywhere to buy one, but they couldn't find one. The mess hall was shut down because there was no large wok for cooking rice. Now that production in the commune is very tight, commune members are cooking for themselves at home every day, which inevitably affects production. Therefore, everyone is asking the commune to quickly find a way to buy a large wok to resume eating in the collective mess hall.
    According to our understanding, several other villages in the commune have also shut down their collective mess halls because they couldn't buy large woks.
    Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments should produce more large woks to meet the needs of the people's commune's collective mess halls.

    多生产大锅
    我们村的集体食堂供应几百人吃饭。前些天，食堂里煮饭用的大铁锅掉了底，派人四处去买，也没买到。食堂就是因为没有大锅煮饭而停办了。现在社里的生产很紧张，社员们每天在家里自己做饭吃，不能够不影响生产。因而大家都要求社里赶快设法买大锅来，恢复在集体食堂吃饭。
    据我们了解，社里还有几个村子的集体食堂，也是因为买不到大锅而停办了。
    因此，我建议有关部门，应多生产大锅，以供应人民公社集体食堂的需要。
