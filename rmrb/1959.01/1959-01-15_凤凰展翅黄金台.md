Phoenix spreads its wings on the golden terrace
Thousands of curved sickles glitter like rainbows,
A thousand rows of rice ears fill the valleys,
The rice ears smile at us,
We look at the rice ears, our hearts filled with joy.
The wind sways the rice stalks, turning golden waves,
The sickle is like a silver dragon stroking the golden sea,
The sound of metal against stone,
Armfuls of gold fall to the ground.
Tie tens of thousands of bundles, stack them in thousands of rows,
Each bundle of gold bars requires five people to carry,
We wouldn't trade it for paradise,
We will cross mountains and valleys to send it to Zhongnanhai.
Every curved sickle glitters like a rainbow,
Every row of grain stacks is a golden terrace,
A little harvest song spreads through the rivers and mountains,
The phoenix spreads its wings and flies to the borderlands.
The phoenix is coming, the phoenix is coming,
The phoenix spreads its wings on the golden terrace,
A hundred birds sing, people dance,
The hero's beautiful name will be passed down through the generations!

    凤凰展翅黄金台
    寒星千把弯镰闪虹彩，满川谷穗千百排，谷穗望咱眉眼笑，咱望谷穗乐开怀。风摇谷秸翻黄浪，镰如银龙捋金海，嚓嚓一片金石声，满抱黄金落尘埃。扎万捆，叠千排，一捆金条五人抬，给咱天堂咱不换，翻山越岭要送中南海。把把弯镰闪虹彩，排排谷垛黄金台，丰收小曲传河岳，凤凰展翅飞边塞。凤凰来呀凤凰来，凤凰展翅黄金台，百鸟欢歌人起舞，英雄美名传万代！
