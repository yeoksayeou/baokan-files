    The Scenery of Our Rivers and Mountains Is So Magnificent
    ——Preface to Li Keran's Collection of Ink and Wash Landscape Sketches
    Fang Ji

    "The scenery of our rivers and mountains is so magnificent" – Li Keran took this famous line of Chairman Mao as his motto during his travels for sketching; and strived to become a painter and eulogist of our motherland's magnificent rivers and mountains. Indeed, this famous line has given extremely clear enlightenment and produced great charm for painters, poets, and for everyone. It makes people look at the rivers, mountains, plants, trees, and even the air and sunshine around them with a deep sense of love and pride, and frequently admire and praise them, and spontaneously generate a lofty emotion of loving the motherland, loving beauty, and loving nature. I think this is where the power of this famous line and landscape paintings, landscape poems, and similar artistic works that reflect the same ideological content lies.

    I am a layman when it comes to painting. But Comrade Keran entrusted me with the important task of writing a preface. Perhaps it is because I have traveled along the Yangtze River twice, and almost all the landscapes depicted in this collection are of the Yangtze River; I have also always liked Comrade Keran's paintings. After reading this collection, I indeed have the desire to say a few words for it.

    The Yangtze River is abundant, beautiful, magnificent, and vast. There is no place where the scenery is without poetry, and no place where the scenery cannot be painted. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Kunlun Snow Mountains rise imposingly. Below the mountains, countless silk-like streams flow through the vast grasslands. This is the initial appearance of the Yangtze River. Then, passing through the valleys of western Sichuan and eastern Tibet, it is like a giant golden python, stirring up thousands of rays of golden light, rolling southward, making a steep bend under the towering Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, crossing the Hengduan Mountains, and flowing towards the east. ...It is a pity that Comrade Keran has not been able to trace the source of the Yangtze River like Xu Xiake; otherwise, he could have written a new "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" scroll.

    But even in this collection, from Mount Emei to Lake Tai, the myriad appearances of the Yangtze River's scenery have been depicted. Such as the magnificence of "A Picture of Rivers and Mountains," the profundity of "Autumn Colors of Mount Emei," and the elegance of "Every Family Is in a Painted Screen," truly evoke a feeling of wanting to express the heroic spirit in one's heart. In many narrative scenes, the painter also writes about the life on both sides of the Yangtze River from various aspects. "Chairman Mao's Hometown," the author writes with a solemn brush, expressing a sense of admiration and respect; this is the typical emotion of the people towards the landscape of the leader's hometown.

    The short walls and clumps of trees in "Lu Xun's Old Residence: Hundred Plant Garden" are intimate and carry a naive fantasy;

    The towering ancient trees of "Du Fu's Thatched Cottage" give people a far-reaching imagination. The prominent image of the "Leshan Giant Buddha" seems to have a folk-style exaggeration; but the use of brush and ink makes it simple and heavy. The mountains in "Sichuan Road" are steep, and the mountains of "Tian Du Peak" and "Qingliang Terrace" are majestic. The brush and ink are clearly from the same school as Mr. Huang Binhong, but the former is vigorous and the latter is strong, depicting the completely different characters of the mountains in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The mountains of Mount Emei and the mountains of Lueyang both use the axe-cut wrinkle method, but the former uses wet ink and the latter uses dry ink, which also expresses the different mountain shapes and rock qualities on the north and south sides of the Qinling Mountains. From these comparisons, we can see the author's ingenuity in conception and skill in brush and ink. Especially the painting "Spring Rain in the Mountains of Sichuan" can truly be worthy of Du Fu's famous line for painting: "The primeval energy is abundant, and the peaks are still wet."

    The painter's feelings for the magnificent Three Gorges scenery are obviously full of exclamation and admiration, thus writing moving scenes like "Morning Mist in the River City," "Wushan Ferry," and "Thousands of Green Mountains." In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the painter's emotions appear fuller, and the brush and ink are used more freely. The transparent water of "Jian Lake" and the extraordinary rain of West Lake have reached a high degree of refinement in brush and ink. And the waves of "Returning Sails on Lake Tai" and the willow branches of "Fishing Boats in Willow Creek" are all swept directly with the central brush, and are as strong as a swimming dragon. "Sunset Glow on Lake Tai" and "After the Rain in the River City" show such rich colors; facing the paintings, it seems that even the fresh and humid air can be breathed. It should also be mentioned about the rain in "Apricot Blossom Spring Rain in Jiangnan." I have seen several different drafts of this painting. First, thick ink and water are used to express the mountains in the rain; under the mountains, in the misty rain, on both sides of the bright stream, around the black-tiled and white-walled villages, the apricot blossoms are dotted with magenta, as brilliant as fire, showing a strong infectiousness. The one printed now uses completely light ink and splash ink, and the apricot blossoms have also been changed to carmine, and even the water surface and roofs show a lingering sense of rain. Thus, the amorousness of the spring rain in Jiangnan and the profound meaning of the apricot blossoms in the rain more deeply depict the character of the Jiangnan landscape.

    Chinese painting has always been called "silent poetry"; it is also said that "there is poetry in painting, and there is painting in poetry." It can be seen that the poetic conception is the life of landscape painting; it is the basic means by which landscape painting conveys thoughts, infects readers, and arouses resonance. But in the past, some people said that this poetic conception was only "to express the unrestrained spirit in one's heart!" Thus, the content of landscape painting was made mysterious. Recently, some people have thought that landscape painting cannot exist independently. To express the atmosphere of the times, it is necessary to add drilling rigs for prospecting, transportation vehicles, or afforestation and so on. How exactly to do it is worth studying. Natural things, especially new things, should not be avoided by painters; but should be actively affirmed and expressed. But stiff combinations may not necessarily achieve the desired effect. The dispute between "form" and "spirit" in Chinese painting has a long history. Su Dongpo once said such cautionary and one-sided words as "Judging painting by likeness in form is neighboring with children." Just as "spirit" without "form" is empty, "form" without "spirit" is dead. The poetic meaning of painting must be based on reality; subjective fantasies that depart from reality, or indifferent natural simulations, cannot produce poetic meaning. "Form" and "spirit" are mutually dependent and consistent. Mountains, rivers, plants, and trees all have form and spirit. Chairman Mao wrote: "Red rain follows the heart and turns into waves, green mountains intentionally become bridges." In the eyes of poets or painters, all natural things are full of life and are deeply affectionate. Therefore, landscapes that truly express the thoughts and feelings of the people can play a role in inspiring people and cultivating temperament, even if there is not a single person or thing on the screen. The natural appearance of landscapes has rarely changed over the centuries; but in the hands of painters of different eras and different classes, they have expressed different artistic conceptions, different characters, and played different roles.

    From the perspective of the development of painting, the landscapes in the paintings were initially only embellishments for paintings depicting production or life. It was only after the human spiritual life had become very developed, after people had discovered themselves in nature, and after the art of language and the tools of writing had become very developed that landscape painting escaped this embellishment status and became an independent art. According to painting history, Chinese landscape painting originated in the Tang Dynasty, was formed in the Song Dynasty, and was fully developed in the Yuan Dynasty. This is generally correct; but it is only from a technical point of view. From the perspective of social life, the stability of life and economic prosperity in the prosperous Tang Dynasty did enable the arts of poetry, painting, music, dance, and so on in our country to achieve great development. And calligraphy, which is directly related to painting, also reached its peak after the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Tang Dynasty. Thus, landscape painting appeared as an independent art form. It is worth noting that these great landscape painters did not appear in the prosperous Tang Dynasty but in the turbulent Five Dynasties and the Two Song Dynasties. Perhaps it was precisely because the feudal society in its heyday was invaded and destroyed by backward ethnic groups that the patriotic consciousness and development requirements of the people were reflected indirectly and tortuously in landscape painting? Social life was originally the objective basis for determining aesthetic concepts, but it was only expressed more tortuously. We can see that although these painters were not completely mature in their understanding and expression of landscapes, their majestic spirit was not accidental. By the time the Mongol Yuan Dynasty ruled China, although landscape painting had further developed, it also expressed the entrustment of the scholar-official class to the pain of national subjugation; but compared with the drama and novels that arose at the same time and were full of resistance and sense of justice, landscape painting took on a strong negative color. Because of the negativity in thought, they found a way out in form, thus developing the techniques of landscape painting and making it perfect. This is not surprising, there have been similar phenomena in the development of Chinese literature. Any art, originating among the people, after passing through the hands of literati and reaching the court, often only has a shell left. Landscape painting reached its peak in the Yuan Dynasty, but it also reached its end, so there was almost no major development in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The Four Masters of the Ming Dynasty and the Four Wangs of the Qing Dynasty all deliberately imitated the ancients, and there were few new creations. On the contrary, during the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasties, several "remnants" who lost their countries, such as Shi Tao and Bada Shanren, expressed their grief and anger through art due to the pain of national subjugation. Because of the sincerity of their emotions, and not being limited by established methods, they dared to be innovative and thus achieved great success. After that, it was not until the modern great painters Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong that they inherited the past and ushered in the future, and summarized the rich experience of their predecessors in their own creations. They took a step forward in the development of Chinese painting.

    Since liberation, the development of production, the leap forward in social life, and the ever-changing natural landscape of the motherland have put unprecedented glorious tasks before landscape painters - to use the rich traditional experience of Chinese painting to express the new appearance of the motherland's rivers and mountains; to continue to inspire and encourage the patriotic and labor enthusiasm of the working people. In this regard, many painters have made great efforts and shown gratifying new achievements. But there are still many problems that need to be further resolved. Now, we see that Chinese painting is forming a new trend. In this trend, Comrade Li Keran's paintings are like a prominent wave, standing at the forefront of the trend with his fresh artistic conception and profound traditional expressive methods. He is an outstanding student of Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong. He has obtained excellent weapons from the arsenal of traditional experience summarized by these two masters, and uses them to face reality and face the contemporary era; in the use and development of traditional expressive methods, he strives to write the thoughts and feelings of the contemporary working people. Judging from the achievements that Comrade Keran has already made, he has found a correct path for himself and is moving forward bravely.

    In 1954 and 1956, Comrade Li Keran traveled along the Yangtze River twice, reaching Yandang in the south and Mount Emei in the west, sketching more than a hundred works. In this way, on the one hand, he depicted the new appearance of the motherland's rivers and mountains, and on the other hand, he honed his brush, preparing conditions for new and larger creations. The rich ideas, skilled brushwork, and active spirit of exploration and creative enthusiasm expressed in this collection all give us such a premonition. Shi Tao's so-called "searching for strange peaks to draft," should also be this meaning? When Comrade Keran was traveling and sketching, he not only took "The scenery of our rivers and mountains is so magnificent" as the theme of his entire creative activity, but also formulated the guidelines for his work: "What is valuable is courage," and "What is needed is soul." The former is to encourage oneself to boldly break through established methods and create; the latter requires oneself to use new thoughts and feelings to create moving artistic conceptions; and fully exert the beautiful educational role of landscape painting.

    After reading this collection, we can say that Comrade Keran has taken an important step in the creation of the new era and has made full preparations for new creations. Therefore, we hope and demand that painters depict the new appearance of the great motherland's rivers and mountains on the drafts of thousands of strange peaks.

    江山如此多娇
    ——李可染同志作水墨山水写生画集序
    方纪
    “江山如此多娇”——李可染同志把毛主席的这一名句当做了他在旅行写生时的座右铭；并努力使自己成为一个祖国如此江山的描绘者、歌颂者。的确，这一名句对于画家、诗人，对于所有的人，都给予了极为鲜明的启示，产生了极大的魅力。使人们对于自己生活周围的江山草木，乃至空气阳光，都不免要带上一种深深的爱恋之情与自豪之感，去频频加以注视，加以赞赏，而油然生发出一种爱祖国、爱美、爱自然的崇高情绪。我想，这就是这一名句和反映了同一思想内容的山水画、风景诗，以及诸如此类艺术作品的力量之所在吧。
    对于绘画，我是外行。但可染同志却把作序这样的重任委托了我。或许是因为我跑过两趟长江，而这本画集里描写的几乎全是长江山水；可染同志的画，也一向爱好。读了这本画集，确也有想要为它说几句话的愿望。
    长江，丰饶，美丽，雄伟，壮阔。无一处山水无诗，无一处山水不可以入画。在青藏高原上，昆仑雪山横空出世。山下无数条丝绸般的溪流，流过莽莽的草原。这就是长江最初的面貌。然后，穿过川康纵谷，它又像一条金鳞巨蟒，搅起金光万道，滚滚向南，在耸立晴空的玉龙雪山下，绕了一个陡直的弯子，越过横断山脉，流向东方。……可惜可染同志还没有能像徐霞客一样，直溯江源；不然他可以写一卷新的长江万里图了。
    但就是在这本画集里，从峨眉到太湖，已经写出了长江山水的万千气象。如“江山如画图”的雄壮，“峨眉秋色”的深邃，“家家都在画屏中”的秀丽，看了真有令人直抒胸中豪气之感。而在许多带有情节性的画面中，画家又从多方面写出了长江两岸的生活。“毛主席的故乡”，作者以庄重的笔，写出了一种高山仰止的气概；这便是人民对于领袖故乡山水的典型的情绪。
  “鲁迅故居百草园”中的短墙、丛树，亲切而带有一种天真的幻想；
  “杜甫草堂”的古木参天，又给人以深远的想像。“嘉定大佛”的突出的形象，似乎带有民间趣味的夸张；但运用笔墨的功夫，又使它变得古朴而厚重。“蜀道”里的山是险峻的，“天都峰”和“清凉台”的山是雄奇的。其笔墨显然同出于黄宾虹先生门下，但前者苍劲而后者矫健，写出了长江上下游两种全然不同的山的性格。峨眉的山和略阳的山，用的同是斧劈皱法，但前者湿墨，后者渴墨，又表现了秦岭南北彼此各异的山势与石质。从这种种比较中，我们看出作者构思的匠心与笔墨的功力。尤其“蜀山春雨”一幅，真可以配得上杜甫“元气淋漓嶂犹湿”这一题画的名句了。
    画家对于壮丽的三峡山水，看得出来是充满了惊叹与赞赏之情的，因而写出了像“江城朝雾”，“巫山渡头”，“青山万重”这样一些动人的景象。到了长江下游，画家的情感显得更加饱满，笔墨也更加运用自如了。透明的“鉴湖”的水，出奇的西湖的雨，笔墨达到了高度的洗练。而“太湖归帆”的波浪，“柳溪渔艇”的柳枝，全用中锋直扫，又像游龙一般矫健。“太湖暮曛”与“江城霁色”，表现了那么丰富的色彩；面对画幅，仿佛连清新而潮润的空气都可以呼吸得到。还应该提到“杏花春雨江南”的雨。我看见过这张画的几张不同的画稿，先是浓墨加水，来表现雨中的山；山下烟雨迷蒙中，明亮的小溪两岸，黑瓦白墙的村舍周围，一树树杏花用洋红点出，绚烂如火，显出来一种强烈的感染力。现在印出的这一幅，却完全用淡墨，用泼墨，杏花也改用胭脂，连水面、屋顶，也看出来缠绵的雨意。于是江南春雨的多情，雨中杏花的深意，更深刻地写出了江南山水的性格。
    中国画向来就被称为“无声的诗”；又说“画中有诗，诗中有画”。可见诗的意境是山水画的生命；是山水画借以传达思想、感染读者，引起共鸣的基本手段。但过去有人把这种意境说成只是“抒写胸中逸气耳”！于是把山水画的内容弄得神乎其神。近来也有人以为山水画已不能独立存在，要表现时代气息，非加上探矿的鑽机，运输的汽车，或者封山造林等等的情节不可。到底如何，很值得研究。自然中存在的事物，尤其新事物，画家不应该回避；而应该积极地加以肯定，加以表现。但生硬的结合，也未必一定收到所希望的效果。中国画中的“形”
  “神”之争，由来久矣了。苏东坡就说过“论画以形似，见与儿童邻”这类警譬而带有片面性的话。正如没有“形”的“神”是空的一样，没有“神”的“形”是死的。画的诗意必须立足于真实的基础上；脱离开真实的主观幻想，或者无动于衷的自然模拟，都不可能产生诗意。“形”与“神”，是相表里，相一致的。山川草木，无不有形有神。毛主席写道：“红雨随心翻作浪，青山着意化为桥”。在诗人或画家看来。一切自然万物，无不是生趣盎然，情深意长的。因此真实表现了人民思想感情的山水，即使画面上不设一人一事，也能够起到鼓舞人心，陶冶性情的作用。山水的自然面貌，千百年来绝少改变；但在不同时代，不同阶级的画家笔下，却表现了不同的意境，不同的性格，起到过不同的作用。
    从绘画的发展看，画中的山水，起初还只是描写生产或生活的画面的陪衬。脱离开这种陪衬的地位而成为一种独立的山水画艺术，当是人的精神生活已经十分发达，人在自然中发现了自己，同时语言的艺术和书写的工具也已经十分发展了以后的事。据画史记载，中国的山水画是起于唐、成于宋、而备于元的。这话大体不差；但还只是从技术方面着眼的。从社会生活方面看，盛唐的生活安定，经济繁荣，确使我国的诗、画、音乐、舞蹈等各门艺术都得到了长足的发展。而与绘画直接有关的书法，经过魏晋到唐，也达到了高峰。于是山水画做为一种独立的艺术形式出现了。到五代和两宋，出现了像荆浩、关同、董源、巨然、以至李成、范宽等一系列有名的山水画家。这些大的山水画家不出现于盛唐而出现于动乱的五代和两宋，是值得注意的。也许正是因为全盛时期的封建社会，受到落后民族的侵略和破坏，人民中的爱国意识和发展要求，曲折而间接地在山水画里反映了出来吧？社会生活原本是决定审美观念的客观基础，只不过表现得比较曲折罢了。我们看这些画家的作品，虽然在对山水的认识和表现上，还不完全成熟，但那种气壮山河的胸襟，绝不是偶然的。等到蒙元统治了中国，山水画虽然进一步发展了，其中也表现了士大夫阶级对于亡国痛苦的有所寄托；但比起同时兴起的，充满了反抗意识和正义感的戏曲和小说来，山水画则带上了浓厚的消极色彩。因为思想上的消极，便在形式上找出路，于是发展了山水画的技法，而使之臻于完备。这并不奇怪，在中国文学的发展中，也有过类似的现象。任何艺术，发生在人民之中，以后经过文人，到达庙堂，便往往只剩了躯壳。山水画到元，是顶峰，但也成了尽头，所以明清几乎没有大的发展。明的四家两代清的四王，无不是刻意模拟古人，新的创意已很少了。倒是在明清之际，几个亡了国的“遗民”，如石涛、八大山人等，由于亡国的痛苦，把满腔悲愤，通过艺术表现出来。因为情感的真挚，而又不受成法所限，敢于标新立异，因而达到很高的成就。此后，一直到现代的大画家齐白石和黄宾虹，才承前启后，继往开来，在自己的创作中，总结了前人的丰富经验。把中国画向前发展了一步。
    解放以来，生产的发展，社会生活的飞跃前进，以及祖国自然面貌的日益变化，在山水画家面前提出了前所未有的光荣任务——运用我国绘画的丰富传统经验，表现祖国河山的新面貌；继续启发和鼓舞劳动人民的爱国主义和劳动热情。在这方面，许多画家进行了巨大的努力，表现了可喜的新的成就。但是还有不少问题，需要进一步解决。现在，我们看到国画正在形成一个新的潮流。在这个潮流中，李可染同志的画像是一个突起的浪涛，以他新鲜的意境和深厚的传统表现方法，站在潮流前面。他是齐白石、黄宾虹的出色的学生，他从这两位大师所总结的传统经验的武库中，取得了精良的武器，挟之以面对现实，面向当代；在运用和发挥传统的表现方法中，力求写出当代劳动人民的思想感情。从可染同志所已经取得的成就看来，他已经为自己找到了一条正确的道路，而勇往直前地走去了。
    李可染同志在1954、1956两年，两游长江，南到雁荡，西抵峨眉，写生百数十幅。这样，一面描写了祖国河山的新面貌，一面磨炼自己的笔，为新的、大的创作准备了条件。这本画集里所表现的丰富的构思，熟练的笔墨，以及积极的探求精神和创造热情，都使我们有这样的预感。石涛所谓“搜画奇峰打草稿”，也当是这种意思吧？可染同志在旅行写生时，既把“江山如此多娇”当做了自己全部创作活动的主题，又为自己制定了工作的准则：曰“可贵者胆”，曰“所要者魂”。前者在于勉励自己去大胆地突破成法，进行创造；后者则要求自己用新的思想感情，创造出感人的意境；充分发挥山水画的美的教育作用。
    读完这本画集，我们可以说可染同志在新时代的创作中，已经走了重要的一步，为新的创作进行了充分的准备。因此我们希望、要求，画家在千万奇峰的草稿上，描绘出伟大祖国河山的新面貌。
