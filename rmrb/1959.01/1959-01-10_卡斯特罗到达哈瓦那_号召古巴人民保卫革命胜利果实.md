Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th: Cuban Provisional Government Armed Forces Commander and former Cuban rebel leader, Castro, entered Havana yesterday amidst the cheers of crowds lining the streets. He came to Havana from Santiago, the provisional capital of Cuba.

It is reported that when Castro entered Havana in a jeep, he was welcomed by tens of thousands of people lining the streets. On that day, all agencies, shops, and factories in Havana stopped working, and the "Antonio Maceo" fast ship, anchored in the bay, even fired a 21-gun salute for Castro, which is usually reserved for heads of state.

Castro met with Cuban Provisional President Urrutia at the Presidential Palace, and then went to the Columbia Barracks, the largest military camp in Cuba, in the suburbs of Havana. It is reported that Castro plans to set up his headquarters here.

Castro addressed tens of thousands of people who welcomed him at the Columbia Barracks. He called on the Cuban people to defend the rights to freedom achieved in the victory of the revolution. Castro said that although tyranny has been overthrown, it will take five to fifteen years to know whether Cubans can obtain the fruits of the victory they have now achieved. He warned and condemned those conspirators who attempted to undermine the new regime. He pointed out that Cuba's path forward is not smooth, and every Cuban should unite to lead Cuba to freedom, happiness, and prosperity.

It is reported that Castro gave a speech on the evening of the 7th while passing through Matanzas Province. He pointed out that the purpose of the revolution is to industrialize Cuba so that everyone has a job. According to the "Adelante" newspaper, Castro also said that the "July 26th Movement" he leads will assist the current provisional government in its work. He stated that this organization will become a political party.

    卡斯特罗到达哈瓦那
    号召古巴人民保卫革命胜利果实
    新华社9日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府武装部队总司令、前古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗昨天在群众的夹道欢迎中进入哈瓦那。他是从古巴临时首都圣地亚哥来到哈瓦那的。
    据报道，当卡斯特罗乘吉普车进入哈瓦那时，沿途受到成千上万的群众的夹道欢迎。当天，哈瓦那各机关、商店和工厂都停止了工作，停泊在海湾的“安托尼奥·马塞奥号”快速舰还使用了通常是对国家元首的礼节，为卡斯特罗鸣礼炮二十一响。
    卡斯特罗在总统府会见了古巴临时总统乌鲁蒂亚，然后前往哈瓦那郊外古巴最大的军营哥伦比亚营。据报道，卡斯特罗准备把他的司令部设在这里。
    卡斯特罗在哥伦比亚营向欢迎他的几万群众讲了话。他号召古巴人民保卫在革命的胜利中取得的自由权利。卡斯特罗说，虽然暴政被推翻了，但是要到五年乃至十五年以后，才能知道古巴人是不是能够取得现在所获得的胜利的果实。他警告并且谴责那些企图破坏新政权的阴谋分子。他指出，古巴的前进的道路并不是平坦的，每个古巴人应该团结起来把古巴引向自由、幸福和繁荣的道路。
    据报道，卡斯特罗7日晚上途经马坦萨斯省时曾发表演说。他指出，革命的目的是要使古巴工业化，使得大家都有工作做。据“前进报”报道，卡斯特罗还说，他所领导的“七月二十六日运动”将协助现在的临时政府进行工作。他表示，这一组织将成为一个政党。
