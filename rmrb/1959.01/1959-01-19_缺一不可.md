    Indispensable
    Yang Ying
    Starting from production and serving production is the key to running successful vocational education for workers. Many vocational schools have carried out vigorous teaching reforms based on the production characteristics of their factories and workshops. Workers, technicians, and full-time teachers have collaborated to compile a new batch of teaching materials, which have achieved great results. Students love this new textbook, and they say: What you learn can be used.
    However, how can vocational education be considered to start from production and serve production? This must have a comprehensive perspective, which not only opposes the tendency to one-sidedly emphasize scientificity and systematicness while neglecting the integration with production practice, but also prevents one-sidedly emphasizing current production needs while neglecting the learning and improvement of systematic basic theoretical knowledge.
    There is a view that female spinning workers only need to learn spinning production knowledge, and cement factory workers only need to learn cement knowledge. Of course, this kind of learning also has its own benefits, which should be affirmed. However, if the workers' learning is completely limited to the narrow scope of their own industry, occupation, and type of work, and the learning of basic cultural knowledge is neglected, this view is also detrimental to the improvement of factory vocational education. The workers' desire for knowledge is generally very high. If we do not pay attention to the teaching of basic courses, we will not be able to meet the workers' requirements well, and it will be difficult to consolidate vocational schools. Obviously, without a certain amount of basic cultural knowledge, professional courses cannot be studied deeply and thoroughly. For example, if workers in chemical factories do not know what an element is, do not know some basic laws of material change, and do not have certain knowledge of mathematics and physics, how can they learn professional courses well? Workers have a very good metaphor: learning is like building a building. We don't have time to build a large foundation in advance, but at least we must build a few buildings and then lay the foundation for a few buildings first.
    Today, this newspaper publishes the practice of Guanghua Chemical Factory Vocational School, which starts from production, uses professional courses to lead basic courses, and not only studies the key issues in current production, but also pays attention to systematic improvement, so that students can use what they have learned in current production and create conditions for further study tomorrow. This approach is worth recommending.
    Of course, there are many ways to combine professional courses and basic courses. The method of Shanghai Guanghua Chemical Factory is one method. Some factories adopt the method of first popularizing and then improving, which is also desirable. There are other methods as well. No matter which method is used, basic courses and professional courses must be combined and carried out alternately, popularizing and improving at the same time. In this way, workers may be able to reach the level of junior college in a relatively short period of time through vocational education.

    缺一不可
    杨瑛
    从生产出发，为生产服务，这是办好职工业余教育的关键。许多业余学校根据本厂本车间的生产特点，大力进行教学改革，工人、技术人员和专职教师合作，编出了一批新的教材，取得了很大的成绩。学生们喜爱这种新课本，他们说：学了就能用得到。
    但是，业余教育怎样才算是从生产出发、为生产服务？这必须有一个全面观点，既反对片面强调科学性系统性而忽视结合生产实际的倾向，也要防止片面强调当前生产需要而忽视系统的基础理论知识的学习和提高。
    有这样一种看法，认为细纱女工只学细纱生产知识，水泥厂工人只学水泥知识就可以了。当然，这种学习也有它一定的好处，这是应当肯定的。但是，如果把工人的学习完全局限在本行本业本工种的狭隘范围内，忽视基础文化知识的学习，这种看法，对工厂业余教育的提高也是不利的。工人群众的求知欲望，一般都很高，如果不注意基础课程的教学，将不能很好满足工人的要求，业余学校也很难巩固。很显然，没有一定的文化基础知识，专业课是学不深学不透的。譬如化工厂的工人，如果不知道什么叫元素，不知道一些起码的物质变化的规律，没有一定的数学、物理知识，专业课又如何能学得好呢？工人们有个极好的比喻：学习犹如造一片大厦。我们没有时间预先打好一大片基础，但至少也要作到造几幢楼房，就先打几幢的基础。
    今天本报发表的光华化学厂业余学校，从生产出发，以专业课带基础课，既学习当前生产中的关键问题，又注意到系统提高，使学生学习之后，既能用之于目前的生产，又为明天深造创造条件。这种做法是值得推荐的。
    当然，专业课和基础课结合的方法，可以多种多样。上海光华化学厂的方法是一种方法。有些工厂采取先普及后提高的办法，也是可取的。还有其他别的方法。不管是哪一种方法，都要把基础课和专业课结合起来，交错进行，一面普及，一面提高。这样，工人群众才有可能在较短的时间内，通过业余教育，达到专科学校的水平。
