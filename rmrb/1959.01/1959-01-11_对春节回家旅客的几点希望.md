    Some Hopes for Spring Festival Homebound Travelers

    The Spring Festival of 1959 is approaching. After a year of great leaps forward, triumphant news from all fronts is constantly being reported. Who wouldn't be doubly happy to welcome the New Year amidst such resounding victories!

    During the Spring Festival, as usual, some people will be going home for the holidays. Everyone is very concerned about the transportation situation this year. This feeling is completely understandable. After all, having bid farewell to our hometowns and loved ones, we've been busy outside for a year, especially after the arduous battles and great victories of the past year. Who wouldn't want to take advantage of this holiday break to go home and see what changes have taken place in our hometowns and in our families? Moreover, many people have been away from their hometowns for years, and haven't been able to go home for several Spring Festivals. It's only reasonable that they hope to go home this year. Here, we would like to talk to everyone about the trend of Spring Festival passenger transport this year and offer a few hopes to comrades preparing to return home for the Spring Festival.

    It seems that more people are planning to go home for the Spring Festival this year than in previous years. Although the number of passenger trains on the railways has increased somewhat over the past year, it is still difficult to fully meet everyone's demand to go home for the holidays. Moreover, even if there are enough carriages, there is still the problem of line capacity. Spring Festival passenger transport is mostly concentrated on trunk lines such as Beijing-Shenyang, Beijing-Guangzhou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Shanghai-Nanjing. These trunk lines are usually very busy, and it is of course difficult to add a large number of passenger trains during the Spring Festival. In terms of waterways and highways, the number of passengers during the Spring Festival this year is also estimated to increase greatly, and the number of ships and vehicles is not sufficient. The above is only about passenger transport. In addition to passenger transport, there is also freight transport. This year is a decisive year in the three years of hard work, and the transportation of production materials cannot be delayed at all; the transportation of people's daily necessities during the Spring Festival must also be guaranteed. The transportation of production materials, the transportation of daily necessities, and the Spring Festival passenger transport are all crowded together, and the heavy burden on the transportation department can be imagined.

    In order to allow many people to happily go home for the Spring Festival, the transportation department must and has actually taken many measures to try to transport more passengers during the Spring Festival. The railway is prepared to use all available passenger cars, make full use of through passenger car stock to run short-distance transportation, and prepare to extract about 4,000 covered wagons to replace passenger cars to transport passengers, while ensuring the transportation of key materials. Waterways and highway departments are also preparing to transfer some cargo ships and trucks to participate in passenger transport and increase the number of runs. Many cities also plan to organize vehicles from government agencies, schools, enterprises, and the military to participate in suburban passenger transport. However, it is still impossible to arrange the travel of tens of millions of people during the Spring Festival concentrated in just a few days. Therefore, our first hope is that those who are determined to go home for the holidays should leave earlier or later, and not all concentrate on the few days before the festival. Staggering the departure dates will allow more people to travel; if everyone is concentrated on the days before the festival, many people will inevitably not be able to travel. In previous years, Spring Festival passenger transport was mostly arranged for a month, and this year, according to the tense transportation situation and the doubling of passengers, the transportation department has decided to arrange Spring Festival passenger transport for a month and a half, from January 15 to the end of February. Local transportation departments should, under the organization, direction, and leadership of the Party and the government, arrange the Spring Festival holiday time for schools, construction sites, and other units accordingly. All those who want to go home for the holidays must abide by this arrangement. Leaving earlier or later may mean that some employees cannot spend the holidays at home, but under such tense transportation conditions, being able to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families for a few days should be considered a wish come true. The transportation department must organize passenger transport well, and it is also hoped that everyone can understand the difficulties of the transportation department. In addition, those whose journeys are relatively short and can be reached on foot in one day should preferably not take public transportation. Those who have bicycles should ride them as much as possible and avoid taking trains, buses, and ships.

    The second hope is that everyone will maintain order in Spring Festival passenger transport and ensure the safety of Spring Festival transport. When there are many people, there will inevitably be crowding, and if things are not handled well, accidents can easily occur. During the Spring Festival, because passengers are particularly crowded, there is an even greater need for good order. The transportation department must take some measures in this regard, such as door-to-door ticket sales to avoid crowding at the station, and sending more crew members to maintain order at ports, stations, and on vehicles. However, the efforts of the transportation department alone are not enough; order needs to be maintained by everyone. Therefore, it is hoped that those who are going home for the holidays will abide by traffic regulations, take care of each other, and assist port and station staff and vehicle crew members in their work. If people from the same unit are traveling in the same direction, it is best to organize them in advance.

    The third hope is a digression. Tens of millions of people are going home for the holidays, some from cities to the countryside, some from inland areas to coastal areas, and some who have been sent down to the countryside are returning to the cities. This is the most extensive exchange between regions, especially between urban and rural areas. Everyone who goes home for the holidays should make use of this opportunity to do two things: first, study; second, publicize. Study, this goes without saying, see more, talk to people, and those returning from the cities to the countryside can learn more about the situation of the people's communes, and will definitely learn a lot. Publicize, this means: those returning from the cities to the countryside should publicize the great leap forward in industry, the heroic spirit and great creations of the working class; those returning from the countryside to the cities should publicize the new face of the countryside, the superiority of the people's communes, and the enthusiasm of the peasant brothers; those returning from the inland to the coast should publicize the bright prospects of inland construction. Through these, we can not only enrich the Spring Festival life, but also improve ourselves and help others, and actually carry out a lively exchange to promote mutual understanding between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants on a very broad scale.

    Spring Festival passenger transport is a matter of concern to the broad masses of the people. Party committees and transportation departments in various localities should comprehensively and properly arrange the transportation of major industrial and agricultural production materials, people's daily necessities, and passengers during the month and a half before and after the Spring Festival, accurately calculate the number of passengers, and arrange their departure dates. During this period, it is best for all units in various localities to suspend organizing visits to other places. For those who stay in their original units and do not go home for the holidays, entertainment during the Spring Festival should be well organized. We believe that under the unified arrangement of the Party committees of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, with the efforts of the transportation departments, and with the assistance of all units and the broad masses of passengers, more people will be able to go home for the Spring Festival this year.

    Comrades who are going home for the holidays, may you have a safe journey, happily reunite with your families, and, after returning to your posts after the holidays, produce, work, and study with even greater enthusiasm!

### 对春节回家旅客的几点希望

    对春节回家旅客的几点希望
    1959年的春节即将到来。经过去年一年的大跃进，各个战线上的捷报频传，凯歌声中迎新春，谁个不倍增欢喜！
    春节期间，照例有些人要回家过节。大家都很关心今年的运输情况。这种心情是完全可以理解的。本来嘛，告别了家乡，告别了亲人，在外面忙了一年，特别是经过去年一年的苦战，获得了巨大胜利，谁不想趁这节日放假的机会回家看看；祖国的建设一日千里，家乡有了哪些变化，家里的人有了哪些变化，谁不时时念在心头？何况不少人一别家乡数载，好几个春节都没有回家过节，今年希望能回家过个节，这更是合情合理的。这里，我们想把今年春节旅客运输的趋势同大家谈谈，并对准备在春节回家的同志们提出几点希望。
    今年准备在春节回家的人，看来比往年要多得多。一年来，铁路上的客车虽然也增加了一些，但要充分满足大家回家过节的要求，还是有困难的；何况即便有足够的车厢，线路的通过能力也有问题。春节旅客运输大都集中在京沈、京广、津浦和沪宁等干线上，这些干线的运输平常就很繁重，春节期间大量增开旅客列车当然也是困难的。在水路和公路方面，今年春节期间旅客人数估计也会大大增加，船舶和车辆的数量都不是充裕的。以上还只是就客运谈客运。除了客运，还有货运。今年是苦战三年中决定性的一年，生产资料的运输一点也不能耽误；春节期间人民生活必需品的运输也要有保障。生产资料的运输、生活资料的运输和春节旅客运输挤在一起，运输部门负担之重，是大家可以想像得到的。
    为了让许多人欢欢喜喜地回家过春节，现在，运输部门必须而且实际上也已经采取了许多措施，力争在春节期间多运送一些旅客。铁路方面准备动用全部可用的客车，充分利用直通客车的车底套跑短途运输，并准备在确保重点物资运输的条件下抽出棚车四千辆左右代替客车来运送旅客。水路和公路部门也准备抽调部分货轮、货车参加客运，增开班次。许多城市也计划组织机关、学校、企业和部队的车辆参加市郊客运。但是，要把几千万人春节期间旅行集中短短几天内来安排还是办不到的。因此，我们第一点希望是，凡一定想回家过节的人最好早走或晚走，不要都集中在节前的那几天里。把走的日期错开来，就能多走一些人；大家都集中在节前那几天走，势必有许多人走不了。往年春节旅客运输大都安排一个月的时间，今年根据运输紧张和旅客倍增的情况，运输部门已决定把春节旅客运输安排为一个半月，即从1月15日起至2月底止。各地运输部门应当在党和政府的组织、主持和领导下，据此安排学校、工地等单位的春节放假时间。凡是要回家过节的人，都要服从这个安排。早走、晚走，可能有部分职工不能节期在家过节，但是在运输这样紧张的情况下，能够回到家乡，同亲人团聚几天，也应该说是如愿以偿了。运输部门必须很好地组织旅客运输，也希望大家能够体谅运输部门的困难。此外，凡是路程比较短、步行一天可以到达的，最好不搭乘公共交通工具，有自行车的尽可能骑自行车，不要去搭坐火车、汽车和轮船。
    第二点希望是，大家都来维持春节旅客运输的秩序，保证春节运输的安全。人多必然拥挤，搞得不好也就容易出事故。春节期间由于旅客特别拥挤，因而就更需要有良好的秩序。运输部门在这方面必须采取一些措施，如上门售票，避免车站购票拥挤，加派乘务员维持港站车船的秩序等等。但是，只靠运输部门一方面的努力还是不够的，秩序需要大家来维持；因此，希望回家过节的人务必遵守交通秩序，并且互相照顾，协助港站工作人员和车船乘务人员做些工作。如果是同一单位往一个方向同行的，最好事先就组织起来。
    第三点希望，是题外的话。几千万人回家过节，有的从城市回到农村，有的从内地回到沿海，有的下放到农村回到城里来，这是一次地区之间、特别是城乡之间最广泛的交流。每一个回家过节的人最好都能利用这个机会做两件事：第一是学习；第二是宣传。学习，这是不用多说的，多看看，找人谈谈，从城市回农村的，更可以多了解人民公社的情况，一定能学到不少东西。宣传，这就是：从城市回到农村的，要宣传工业的大跃进，工人阶级的英雄气概和伟大创造；从农村回到城市的，要宣传农村的新面貌，人民公社的优越性，农民兄弟的积极性；从内地回到沿海的，要宣传内地建设的远大前景。通过这些，不仅能丰富春节的生活，而且能提高自己，帮助别人，实际上在很广泛的范围内开展一次增进城乡之间、工农之间相互了解的生动活泼的交流。
    春节旅客运输，是一个广大人民关心的问题。各地党委和交通运输部门应该全面地妥善安排春节前后一个半月期间工农业生产主要物资、人民生活必需品和旅客的运输，切实计算旅客人数，安排他们的启程日期。在这个期间，各地各个单位最好也暂停组织到外地去参观访问。对于留在原单位而不回家过节的人，要很好地组织春节期间的娱乐。我们相信，在各省、市、自治区党委的统一安排下，在交通运输部门的努力下，依靠各单位和广大旅客的协助，今年春节一定能有更多的人回家过节。
    回家过节的同志们，愿你们一路平安，愉快地和家人团聚，并且在假满回到自己的岗位之后更加干劲十足地生产、工作和学习！
