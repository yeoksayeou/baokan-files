    Martyrs' Last Words Are Thought-Provoking

    After reading the German martyrs' quotes compiled in your newspaper on December 30th, I was very moved. From these heroic words, we see the true qualities of communists and are deeply inspired.

    To realize the beautiful ideals of mankind, great communists are willing to sacrifice everything, even their precious lives. They despise the enemy, despise difficulties, and despise death. They can "walk to the guillotine with their heads held high and calmly" (Rudolf Seiffert), firmly believing that a new era is about to begin. Just as Walter Husemann wrote: "I die as a class fighter, just as I was born as a class fighter!" What a lofty thought and great mind!

    Living in a happy society that the martyrs fought for with their blood and sacrifice, it is very meaningful for us to review the martyrs' last words. We must love and cherish today even more, and work selflessly for a better tomorrow.

    烈士遗言发人深省
    读过12月30日你报所辑的德国烈士语录，心情非常激动。从这些豪言壮语里，我们看到共产党人的英雄本色、受到深刻启发。
    伟大的共产主义者为了实现人类的美好理想，情愿牺牲自己的一切以至宝贵的生命，他们藐视敌人，藐视困难，藐视死亡，可以“挺直身子镇定地走向断头台”（鲁道夫·赛弗特），坚信新的时代就要开始。正像瓦尔特·胡赛曼所写的那样：“我作为阶级战士而死，就像我作为阶级战士而生一样！”这是何等崇高的思想和伟大的胸襟！
    生活在烈士们流血牺牲而争取得来的幸福社会里，我们温习烈士们的遗言，是很有意义的。我们要更热爱更珍惜今天，并为更美好的明天忘我地劳动。
