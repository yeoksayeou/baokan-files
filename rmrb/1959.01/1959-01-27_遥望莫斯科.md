    Looking Towards Moscow
    Lin Ling

    Communist society is humanity's highest ideal. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy is a grand program for building a communist society. All who look to the future, who pursue ideals, see in this plan a bright future for humanity, and a clearly defined vision of human social development.

    Though it's a vision, it is not really that far off. Once you see the mountain, the mountain is not far. Seven years – this will be an important, but not very long, journey towards that beautiful vision. In these seven years, the Soviet Union will develop at a rate several times higher than that of all capitalist countries, including the United States, making a great leap forward from socialism to communism.

    Leaping forward to a communist society is an event of great significance in human history. These days, progressive people all over the world are looking towards Moscow. There, the red star shines, and the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opens today. This congress, which is being watched by hundreds of millions of people, will discuss and adopt this great leap forward plan, making it a concrete deployment for the Soviet Union's 200 million people to fight for seven years. This congress is a distinct milestone in the history of human development.

    Bearing the great mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future for mankind, the outstanding representatives of the vanguard of the working classes of all countries go to Moscow to congratulate the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They bring with them the congratulations of the working people of all countries, and the excited hearts of progressive people all over the world.

    Humanity is immortal. Although capitalist society rots away day by day, decays day by day, and is destroyed day by day, the newborn forces, the youngest class in human society, are breaking through all kinds of difficulties, building a new world, and arranging a bright and splendid future for humanity. First the Soviet Union, then a dozen other socialist countries – these newborn forces are fighting heroically to create a new world. They are the creators of history, because they have mastered the laws of historical development.

    Comrade Khrushchev said in the outline of the report on the seven-year plan that the reason why the Soviet people have successfully completed the magnificent tasks of economic construction in the past and now is "because the Communist Party starts from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on the laws of social development, and relies on the creative enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of the working people."

    Because they have mastered the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on the laws of social development, the newborn forces of mankind are able to win victory step by step and become the creators of history. The outdated capitalist old world, which has been abandoned by history, with all its flailing is merely a dying struggle, because the laws of social development do not shift according to people's subjective desires. The iron laws of historical development have long declared: "Those who obey me prosper, those who resist me perish!" This is why "we are getting better and better every day," and "the enemy is rotting away day by day."

    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which will discuss and adopt the grand plan for building communism, is an important historical milestone in the daily improvement of the newborn forces of mankind. Let us join all progressive people in hanging bright red ribbons on this milestone to express our warm congratulations! (Attached picture)

    遥望莫斯科
    林陵
    共产主义社会是人类的最高理想。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，是建设共产主义社会的宏伟纲领。凡是瞩望将来的人，追求理想的人，都在这个计划里看到了人类美好的未来，看到了轮廓鲜明的人类社会发展的远景。
  虽说远景，其实已经并不遥远。看到山，山就不远了。七年，这将是走向美丽远景的一段重要的、但是并不很长的路程。在这七年中，苏联将以高于包括美国在内的各资本主义国家的经济发展速度好几倍的速度向前发展，来一次从社会主义向共产主义的大跃进。
    向共产主义社会跃进，是人类历史上意义重大的事件。这几天，全世界的进步人类都遥望着莫斯科。在那里红星闪烁，苏共第二十一次代表大会在今天召开了。这个为亿万人关心着的大会，将讨论和通过这一跃进计划，使这计划成为苏联二万万人民奋战七年的具体部署。这个大会，是人类发展历史上的一个标志鲜明的里程碑。
    负着人类继往开来的伟大使命的各国工人阶级派自己先锋队的优秀的代表，到莫斯科去，向苏联共产党祝贺。他们带去了各国劳动人民的祝贺，带去了全世界进步人类的激动的心。
    人类是不朽的，尽管资本主义社会在一天天烂下去，一天天衰朽，一天天毁灭，但是新生的力量，人类社会中最年轻的阶级，却突破种种困难，建设新世界，为人类安排光辉灿烂的未来。首先是苏联，然后是十几个其他社会主义国家的新生力量，轰轰烈烈地为创造新世界而奋战。他们是历史的创造者，因为他们掌握了历史发展的规律。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在七年计划的报告提纲里说，苏联人民所以能历次胜利地完成经济建设的宏伟任务，过去和现在都“是因为共产党从马克思列宁主义关于社会发展规律的基本原理出发、依靠广大劳动群众的创造积极性和主动性”。
    人类的新生力量由于掌握了马克思列宁主义关于社会发展规律的基本原理，能够步步取得胜利，成为历史的创造者。已经过时的、被历史遗弃的资本主义旧世界，一切蠢动只是垂死的挣扎，因为社会发展规律不是以人的主观愿望为转移的。历史发展的铁的规律早就宣布过：“顺我者昌，逆我者亡！”这便是为什么“我们一天天好起来，”“敌人一天天烂下去”的缘故。
    将讨论和通过建设共产主义宏伟计划的苏共二十一次代表大会，是人类新生力量一天天好起来的一个重要的历史里程碑，我们和全体进步人类一起为这里程碑挂上鲜红的彩带，表示热烈的祝贺吧！（附图片）
