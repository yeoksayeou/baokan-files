    Victory Will Surely Belong to the Cuban People
    To the Editor:
    We were very excited to see in the recent newspapers that the Cuban people have overthrown the dictatorial regime that had been riding roughshod over them for many years and have embarked on the road to democracy and freedom. The dictator Batista was a lackey of U.S. imperialism, relying on U.S. support to maintain his rule in Cuba while selling out Cuba's national interests to the United States. Therefore, his downfall is not only a great victory for the Cuban people in their struggle for democracy and freedom but also a major failure of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Latin America. This is particularly gratifying for the people of the world.
    The developments of the past few days show that the reactionary U.S. groups are not reconciled to the failure they have suffered in Cuba. They are viciously attacking the Cuban provisional government, which has the support of the people, slandering its legitimate actions to punish enemies of the people as "massacres," and clamoring for interference in Cuba's internal affairs. We express our great indignation at this arrogant and unreasonable behavior of the United States and fully support the Cuban people's stern protests against U.S. interventionists.
    U.S. imperialism has long proven to be the most ferocious enemy of the people of all countries striving for national independence. Wherever there is a struggle for independence and freedom in the world, there is no shortage of U.S. interference. And in Latin America, which the United States regards as its own "backyard," there are countless such disgraceful records. But just as today's Asia and Africa are no longer yesterday's Asia and Africa, today's Latin America is no longer yesterday's Latin America either. The days when U.S. imperialism could arbitrarily issue orders are over. The U.S. conspiracy to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs is bound to fail, and the people of the world will further recognize the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism from this latest act of disregard for international law and discipline.

### 胜利必将属于古巴人民

    胜利必将属于古巴人民编辑同志：
    从最近的报纸上看到了古巴人民推翻了骑在他们头上多年的独裁政权，走上了民主自由的道路。我们感到十分兴奋。独裁者巴蒂斯塔是美帝国主义的奴才，过去一方面依靠美国的支持维持在古巴的统治，一方面把古巴的民族利益双手出卖给美国。因此他的倒台，不仅是古巴人民争取民主自由的一大胜利，同时也是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲侵略政策的一大失败。这是特别值得全世界人民高兴的。
    近几天的事态发展表明，美国的反动集团对于他们在古巴所遭到的失败并不甘心，他们对得到人民支持的古巴临时政府进行恶毒的攻击，把它惩处人民公敌的正当行动诽谤为“屠杀”，并且叫嚣要对古巴内政进行干涉。我们对美国这种蛮横无理的行径表示极大的愤慨，完全支持古巴人民对美国干涉者的严正抗议。
    美帝国主义早就证明了是争取民族独立的各国人民最凶恶的敌人，世界上哪里有要求独立和自由的斗争，哪里就少不了美国的干涉。而在被美国视为自己“后院”的拉丁美洲，更是有着数不清的这种可耻纪录。但是正如今天的亚洲和非洲已经不是昨天的亚洲和非洲一样，今天的拉丁美洲也已经不再是昨天的拉丁美洲了，美国帝国主义可以任意发号施令的日子已经过去。美国对干涉古巴内政的阴谋是一定要失败的，而全世界人民也将会从美国这又一次目无国际法纪的行为中，更加认清美帝国主义的凶恶面目。
