    Light Industry Must Have Greater Development
    The great agricultural harvest of 1958, and the overall leap forward in industry with steel as the key link, have placed China's light industry in a completely new situation. The doubling of cotton and grain production, and the bumper harvests of economic crops such as tobacco and sugar materials, have changed the past situation of insufficient raw materials for light industry. The task of processing agricultural products is very heavy, and it is urgent to increase the production capacity of existing equipment and add new equipment. This is one aspect of the current situation. On the other hand, with the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the increase in people's purchasing power, and the development of the cultural revolution and the technical revolution, the needs of urban and rural people for light industrial products have greatly increased. The paper required for newspapers and periodicals has increased many times over; the demand for newsprint alone greatly exceeds the total output of all existing machine-made newsprint. The sales volume of crude salt has also increased greatly, with salt for agricultural and pastoral use exceeding the original plan by more than ten times, and industrial salt exceeding the original plan by 400,000 tons due to the great development of the alkali-making industry. Since the establishment of people's communes, the sales volume of rice bowls, thermos bottles, enamelware, sewing machines, rubber shoes, leather shoes, bicycles, children's toys, milk powder, biscuits, knitwear, etc., have also increased significantly.
    In such a new situation, the main contradiction of light industry at present is insufficient production capacity. The only way to solve the contradiction is to actively and vigorously develop production according to the supply of raw materials and the needs of the market. Only by vigorously developing production can we turn passivity into initiative, which is conducive to the development of the entire national economy. Because there are close links between various departments of the national economy, such as between industry and agriculture, between heavy industry and light industry, as well as between various departments of heavy industry and various departments of light industry. Although there are major and minor links in the entire social production process, and there is a distinction between the key link and the specific items, the major and minor links, the key link and the specific items promote and influence each other. We can only drive the minor links with the major links, and lead the specific items with the key link. We must never only lift the key link and not develop the specific items, or only grasp the major links and discard the minor links. Therefore, in socialist construction, we must follow the objective law of proportional development of various departments of the national economy, so that various indicators maintain appropriate proportions to each other. The so-called appropriate proportion, taking heavy industry and light industry as an example, means that on the one hand, we must ensure the priority development of heavy industry, and on the other hand, we must ensure that the development of light industry can adapt to the growth of agricultural raw materials and to the needs of people's lives. The priority development of heavy industry can provide equipment and power for the development of various departments of the national economy (including light industry). The development of light industry keeping up with the growth of agricultural raw materials and meeting the needs of people's lives can promote the further development of agriculture and further inspire the people's enthusiasm for building socialism. The further development of agriculture can open up a broad market for the development of industry. At the same time, light industry is an important source of socialist accumulation, and its development can also increase accumulation for heavy industry. The policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and combining industry and agriculture, and heavy industry and light industry, is a guarantee for the proportional and high-speed development of various departments of China's national economy. Therefore, when the equipment capacity of light industry has lagged behind the growth of agricultural raw materials and behind market demand, the light industry sector must have greater development.
    How can light industry have greater development? This requires implementing the central government's policy of combining central and local industries, combining large and small and medium-sized enterprises, combining foreign and indigenous methods of production, and combining centralized leadership and large-scale mass movements. This means walking on two legs, with both "large, foreign and group" and "small, indigenous and group", instead of walking on one leg or one and a half legs. China's large and foreign light industry has a certain foundation. Since last year, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the broad masses of workers have developed a pioneering style, and miracles of technical innovation have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In the textile industry, such as the Model 59 cotton opener, high-yield carding machine, combing and drawing combined machine, and super-large drafting spinning machine, all have great significance, which can not only improve production efficiency, but also save a lot of steel and machinery manufacturing power. The workers in the papermaking industry have created technologies such as continuous cooking, continuous pulping, vacuum suction cylinder, and automatic paper leading, which have doubled production efficiency. Thanks to the workers' innovations, the salt industry has found ways to mechanize everything from pressing the bottom of the pond, raking salt, lifting salt, piling salt, loading and unloading, to transporting. The main processes of industries such as glass and enamel have also found ways to achieve mechanized production quickly, well, and economically. These are the keys to rapidly improving the production capacity of light industry. The current task is to continue to implement the "two participations, one reform" in existing enterprises, mobilize the masses, and through large-scale mass movements, universally apply the achievements of technical innovation that have already emerged to the construction of new enterprises and the transformation of old enterprises; continue to improve labor organization, tap potential, and further exert the backbone role of the "large, foreign and group".
    Modernized light industrial enterprises are the backbone of China's light industry. There are not too many of these enterprises now, but too few. In order to make light industry have greater development, it is also very necessary to build a batch of new ones according to needs and possibilities. In order to build these enterprises, the mechanical equipment of light industry should also have corresponding development. Of course, in construction, we must also distinguish between priorities and urgencies. It is impossible for all projects to start at the same time. We should strictly prioritize them, ensure the key points, build one batch, and then build another batch. First, we should ensure the construction of enterprises that are currently most urgently needed, such as the textile industry and the papermaking industry. These enterprises are the focus of light industry construction.
    People's communes running industries in a big way is an important part of implementing the whole set of two-legged walking policy proposed by the central government. People's communes running industries have great political and economic significance. "The development of commune industries will not only accelerate the process of national industrialization, but also promote the realization of ownership by the whole people in rural areas and narrow the gap between cities and villages." (Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes) Therefore, while vigorously grasping agriculture, people's communes must also grasp industry. When running industries, in addition to running heavy industries that serve the development of agriculture and the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification, and serve large industries, they must also run light industries that serve the daily needs of commune members and the socialist market. People's communes running light industries in a big way is not only a major step in solving the current shortage of light industrial products, but also the basic direction of the development of light industry. More than 80% of the raw materials for light industry are in rural areas, and the products are also mainly sold in rural areas. In the past, the distribution of China's light industry was not entirely rational. Most of the factories were built in cities. Whether it was oil extraction, sugar making, or spinning and weaving, raw materials were transported from rural areas to cities, processed and manufactured by factories located in cities, and then the products were transported back from cities to rural areas. This round-trip transportation not only wasted a lot of labor, increased the burden of transportation, but also increased costs. People's communes running light industries in a big way can make the distribution of China's light industry more rational, making production and raw materials, and production and markets closer, which can not only meet the material and cultural needs of commune members, but also save the country's transportation power; it can not only increase the material foundation of people's communes and increase fiscal revenue, but also reduce product costs.
    When people's communes run light industries, they must also pay attention to the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, just like when running heavy industries. Don't run industries that don't have raw materials locally and need to get raw materials from very, very far away, so as not to increase costs and waste labor. We should also try to run more comprehensive utilization factories, so as to fully utilize rural resources to create more material wealth for the people. In terms of production technology, we should implement the principle of combining manual operation and mechanical operation, and combining indigenous methods of production and foreign methods of production. All handicrafts that originally have a foundation and have development prospects must continue to develop, and gradually carry out necessary technical reforms. Industries that produce by machine must also rely on their own efforts, make full use of indigenous iron and steel, indigenous machinery, and indigenous methods, and gradually move from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and from low-level to high-level.
    People's communes running light industries are not only necessary, but also possible. The example of people's communes in Gaotang County, Shandong, running industries in a big way, published in this newspaper today, is a very convincing example. Under the leadership of the county party committee and the commune party committee, this commune, after forty days of struggle from October 15th to the end of November last year, newly built and renovated one hundred and eighty-one factories. Among them, there are heavy industrial factories such as machinery and fertilizers, as well as light industrial factories such as sugar making, grain processing, clothing, shoe making, alcohol, knitting, food, starch, glass, leather making, and papermaking. Now, more than 65% of the people in the county have eaten machine-made noodles and wear machine-sewn clothes; in the future, after normal production, the alcohol produced can meet the needs of all power raw materials; the cultural paper produced can provide an average of sixteen catties per person per year; and 240,000 bolts of cloth are spun and woven by themselves. The experience of Gaotang tells us that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the party committee, carry out unified planning, and launch a large-scale mass movement, people's communes can not only run light industries, but also run them quickly and well.

### 轻工业必须有较大的发展

    轻工业必须有较大的发展
    1958年农业的大丰收，以钢为纲，工业全面大跃进，使我国轻工业面临着一种全新的形势。棉粮产量翻一番，烟叶糖料等经济作物的丰收，改变了过去轻工业原料不足的局面，农产品加工任务十分繁重，急需提高现有设备的生产能力和增加新设备。这是当前形势的一面。另一方面，随着工农业生产的大发展，人民购买力的提高，以及文化革命和技术革命的开展，城乡人民对轻工业产品的需要大大增加。报纸、刊物所需要的纸张成倍地增长着，仅新闻纸的需要就大大超过现有全部机制新闻纸的总产量。原盐销售量也大大增加，农牧业用盐就超出原计划的十几倍，工业用盐由于制碱工业的大发展也超过原计划四十万吨。人民公社建立以后，饭碗、热水瓶、搪瓷品、缝纫机、胶鞋、皮鞋、自行车、儿童玩具、奶粉、饼干、针织品等的销售量，也有显著的增加。
    在这样的新形势下，轻工业当前的主要矛盾是生产能力不够，解决矛盾的唯一办法就是根据原料的供应和市场的需要，积极地大力地发展生产。只有大力发展生产，才能变被动为主动，有利于整个国民经济的发展。因为国民经济各部门之间，如工业和农业之间，重工业和轻工业之间，以及重工业各部门之间和轻工业各部门之间，有着密切的联系。虽然在整个社会生产的过程中，有主要环节和次要环节之分，有纲和目之别，但主要环节和次要环节，纲和目却是互相促进、互相影响着的。我们只能以主要环节带动次要环节。以纲带目，绝不能只举纲，不张目，只抓主要环节，而丢掉次要环节。所以，在社会主义建设中，必须根据国民经济各部门按比例发展的客观法则，使各项指标相互保持适当的比例。所谓适当的比例，拿重工业和轻工业来说，就是一方面必须保证重工业的优先发展，另一方面，又必须保证轻工业的发展能够跟农业原料的增长相适应，跟人民生活需要相适应。重工业优先发展了，才能给国民经济各部门（包括轻工业）的发展提供设备和动力。轻工业的发展跟上农业原料的增长，跟上人民生活提高的需要，就可以促进农业的进一步发展，就可以进一步鼓舞人民建设社会主义的积极性。农业进一步发展了，就可以为工业的发展开辟广阔的市场。同时，轻工业还是社会主义积累的重要来源，它的发展还可以为重工业增加积累。党中央和毛泽东同志制订的在优先发展重工业的基础上，工业和农业并举，重工业和轻工业并举的方针，是使我国国民经济各部门按比例高速度发展的保证。所以，在轻工业设备能力已经落后于农业原料的增长，落后于市场需要的时候，轻工业部门必须要有较大的发展。
    如何使轻工业有较大的发展呢？这就需要贯彻中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举，以及集中领导和大搞群众运动并举的方针。这也就是用“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路，而不是用一条腿或一条半腿走路。我国大的洋的轻工业是有一定基础的。去年以来，广大职工在各级党委的领导下，发扬了独创的风格，技术革新的奇迹如雨后春笋一般。在纺织工业方面，如59型清花机、高产梳棉机、清钢联合机、超大牵伸精纺机等，都具有很大的意义，既能提高生产效率，又能节约大量钢材和机械制造力量。造纸工业的职工创造了连续蒸煮、连续打浆、抽气圆网、自动引纸等技术，使生产效率提高一倍。制盐工业由于工人的创造，从压固池底、扒盐、抬盐、堆盐、装卸到搬运，都找到了实现机械化的办法。玻璃、搪瓷等工业的主要工序，也找到了又快又好又省的实现机械化生产的道路。这些都是迅速提高轻工业生产能力的关键。现在的任务，就是在现有企业中，继续贯彻“两参一改”，发动群众，通过大搞群众运动，把已经出现的技术革新成就，普遍运用到新建企业和老企业的改造上面去；继续改善劳动组织，发掘潜力，进一步发挥“大洋群”的骨干作用。
    现代化的轻工业企业是我国轻工业的骨干。这一类企业，现在不是太多，而是太少，要使轻工业有较大的发展，根据需要和可能新建一批也很必要。为了建设这些企业，轻工业的机械设备也应有相应的发展。当然，在建设中也要分别轻重缓急，不可能所有项目都一齐上马，应当严格排队，保证重点，建了一批，再建一批，首先保证纺织工业、造纸工业等目前最迫切需要的企业的建设，这些企业，是轻工业建设的重点。
    人民公社大办工业，是贯彻中央提出的一整套两条腿走路的方针的重要一环。人民公社办工业，具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。“公社工业的发展，不但将加快国家工业化的进程，而且将在农村中促进全民所有制的实现，缩小城市和乡村的差别。”（关于人民公社若干问题的决议）所以，人民公社在大力抓农业的同时，又要抓工业。在办工业的时候，除了办为发展农业和实现农业机械化、电气化服务、为大工业服务的重工业外，还要举办为满足社员日常生活需要和社会主义市场服务的轻工业。人民公社大办轻工业，既是解决当前轻工业品不足的重大步骤，也是轻工业发展的基本方向。轻工业的原料80％以上在农村，产品也主要销在农村。过去，我国轻工业的分布不尽合理，工厂大都建在城市，榨油也好，制糖也好，纺纱织布也好，都是从农村将原料运进城市，由设在城市的工厂加工制造之后，再从城市把产品运回农村，这样往返运输，既浪费大量的劳动力，增加运输的负担，又增加了成本。人民公社大办轻工业，就可以使我国的轻工业得到合理的分布，使生产和原料、生产和市场更加接近，既能满足社员的物质生活和文化生活的需要，又能节省国家的运输力量；既能增加人民公社的物质基础，增加财政收入，又能降低产品成本。
    人民公社办轻工业的时候，也要像办重工业一样，必须注意因地制宜、就地取材的原则，不要办那些本地没有原材料、要到很远很远的地方去取原料的工业，以免增加成本，浪费劳动力。还要尽可能地多办一些综合利用的工厂，以便充分利用农村的资源为人民创造更多的物质财富。在生产技术方面，应当实行手工操作和机械操作相结合、土法生产和洋法生产相结合的原则。凡是原来有基础而又有发展前途的手工业，一定要继续发展，并且逐步进行必要的技术改革。机器生产的工业也必须自力更生，充分利用土钢铁、土机械、土办法，逐步由土到洋，由小到大，由低级到高级。
    人民公社办轻工业，不仅有必要，也有可能。今天本报发表的山东高唐县的人民公社大办工业就是一个很有说服力的例子。这个公社在县委和公社党委的领导下，经过从去年10月15日到11月下旬的四十天奋斗，新建和改建了一百八十一个工厂。其中有机械和化肥等重工业工厂，也有制糖、粮食加工、被服、制鞋、酒精、针织、食品、淀粉、玻璃、制革、造纸等轻工业工厂。现在全县已经有65％以上的群众吃到了机器面，穿到了机器缝纫的衣服；将来生产正常以后，所生产的酒精可以满足全部动力原料的需要；所生产的文化纸，每人每年平均可得十六斤；自纺自织的布二十四万匹。高唐的经验告诉我们，只要加强党委的领导，进行统一规划，大搞群众运动，人民公社不但能够办轻工业，而且还办得又快又好。
