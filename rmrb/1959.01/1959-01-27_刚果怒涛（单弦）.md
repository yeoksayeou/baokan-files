    Congo Torrent (Single String)
    Wang Jue
    (Opening) The Congo River's waves surge,
    The roar of the waves is like thunder.
    The bugle call of independence, rides the spring breeze,
    A sharp spirit soars through the long rainbow;
    The flames of national revolution blaze,
    Look, flames fly across the African continent.
    (Counting Song) The Congo is in central Africa,
    Known as the "Jewel of Africa," world-renowned.
    It has an area of more than 2.3 million square kilometers,
    And a population of thirteen million and change.
    Uranium and diamond mines are richly deposited.
    There is beautiful scenery everywhere.
    But it has become a colony of Belgium,
    And has suffered from plunder and enslavement for eighty years.
    Since World War II,
    Oppressed by American, British, and French imperialism,
    The Congo has suffered even more bullying.
    (Taiping Nian Tune) The colonialists' bloody rule,
    Has made the Congolese people increasingly poor.
    Some people can't even eat one meal a day.
    As slaves, they labor without pay all day long,
    Millions of people are abducted to foreign countries to work as coolies.
    Blood flows into rivers,
    Cries of sorrow rise everywhere.
    Eisenhower, that vampire, openly declared:
    He said: "I really cannot understand,
    What shall we do without the Congo?"
    Shameless, humph! Reactionary to the core,
    He has forgotten that this is the people's century, and that colonialism
    Is a dead end.
    Today's Africa,
    Is no longer silent.
    The heroic people are fighting,
    Look! From Algeria, Nigeria,
    Cameroon, to Guinea,
    The anti-colonialist tide is surging.
    (Towing Boat Tune) The sleeping Congo has awakened,
    The voice of justice pierces the sky.
    A struggle has unfolded for national independence.
    (Flowing Water Tune)
    Right there on January 4th, an uprising occurred,
    The location was the city of Léopoldville.
    Crowds of people took to the streets,
    To hold demonstrations for independence.
    They smashed the colonial government offices,
    Crash, the glass flew halfway up into the sky.
    The police and the army were at a loss,
    So frightened that they trembled with fear.
    They hurriedly set up machine guns to strafe,
    They hastily airlifted in tanks and paratroopers.
    They vainly try to use cannons and bayonets to scare the masses,
    Who would have thought that the resistance movement would be like a prairie fire,
    Continuous, one rising after another, demonstrations
    Continue to occur in various places.
    This is the Congo River's surging torrent,
    A volcano erupts in the oasis, shaking heaven and earth.
    Seeing that an even greater storm is about to arrive,
    Let those colonialists rot day by day,
    In front of the people, they dare not go crazy again.

    刚果怒涛（单弦）
    王决
    （曲头）刚果河水浪花涌，
    波涛怒吼像雷鸣。
    独立的号角，乘春风，
    锐气冲发贯长虹；
    民族革命火熊熊，
    你看那，非洲大陆烈焰飞腾。
    （数唱）刚果在非洲中部，
    号称“非洲的宝石”举世闻名。
    面积二百三十多万平方公里，
    人口有一千三百万挂零。
    铀矿、金刚石矿，蕴藏丰富。
    到处有美丽的风景。
    可是它沦为比利时的殖民地，
    八十年来被掠夺、奴役苦难重重。
    第二次世界大战以来，
    美、英、法帝国主义压迫，
    刚果更受尽欺凌。
    （太平年）殖民者血腥统治，
    刚果人民越来越贫穷。
    有些人一天吃一顿都不可能。
    当奴隶整天是无偿的劳动，
    千万人被劫到外国去做苦工。
    鲜血流成河，
    遍地起哭声。
    艾森豪威尔这个吸血鬼却公开声明：
    他说：（白）“我真不能理解，
    没有刚果我们将怎么办？”
    厚颜无耻，哼！反动透顶，
    他忘了人民的世纪，殖民主义
    这条道是此路不通。
    今天的非洲，
    早已不是默默无声。
    英勇的人民正进行斗争，
    看！从阿尔及利亚、尼日利亚、
    喀麦隆，到几内亚，
    反殖民主义的浪潮风起云涌。
    （倒推船）沉睡的刚果已觉醒，
    正义的吼声划破了长空。
    为民族独立展开了斗争。
    （流水板）
    就在那1月4日发生暴动，
    地点是利奥波德维尔城。
    群众们成群结伙到街上，
    为独立举行示威大游行。
    捣毁了殖民政府办公室，
    哗啦啦玻璃飞往半悬空。
    警察和军队没了主意，
    只吓得哆哩哆嗦胆战心惊。
    急忙忙架上机枪来扫射，
    慌张张空运来坦克和伞兵。
    妄想用大炮刺刀吓倒群众，
    那想到反抗运动，如火燎原、
    连续不断、此伏彼起，示威
    在各地继续发生。
    这就是刚果河上怒涛涌，
    绿洲中火山喷发天地惊。
    眼看着更大的风暴就要来到，
    让那些殖民主义者，一天天烂下去，
    在人民的面前，不敢再发疯。
