Smoked Kiln, Smoked Cellar, Underground Tunnel Three-Ring System
    One Smoking Produces 4,000 Loads of Fertilizer

    Wang Xianfu, a Communist Party member from the Beixiazhuang Production Brigade of the Yu County United Cooperative in Shanxi Province, and three others, created a three-ring system of smoking fertilizer using smoked kilns, smoked cellars, and underground tunnels, which can produce 4,000 loads of fertilizer in half a month.

    The specific method for the three-ring smoking soil fertilizer is as follows: Near an earthen ridge, dig a brick kiln-shaped vertical well (cellar), fill it with soil clumps, build a smoking kiln with a capacity of 500 loads on the ground around the wellhead, and open four small openings around the wellhead. At the small openings, build tunnels extending outward for more than 20 steps, and build a small smoking cellar at the end of the tunnels. In this way, the three-ring smoking kiln is completed. When smoking the fertilizer, light a fire in the bottom cellar, and the smoke will pass from the large smoking kiln through the tunnels to the small smoking cellar, smoking all the soil clumps.

    Using the three-ring smoking kiln to make fertilizer has three major advantages: First, the entire fertilizer-making process takes only fifteen days, requiring only twenty workers to smoke 4,000 loads of fertilizer. Second, it can be used wherever there are dry soil clumps and earthen ridges. Third, using this method, every two loads of fertilizer only requires one jin of firewood.

    熏窑熏窖地道三连环
    一次熏肥四千担
    山西盂县联社北下庄生产大队共产党员王先福等四人，创造了熏窑、熏窖、地道三连环的熏肥方法，半月就能制肥四千担。
    三连环熏土肥的具体作法是：在靠土垅的地方挖一个砖窑形的立井（窖），装上土块，在井口周围地面上堆砌一个容量五百担的熏窑，并在井口周围开四个小口，在小口处向外垒起长二十余步的地道，在地道口再建一个小熏窖。这样，三连环的熏窑便建成了。在熏肥的时候，在底窑点火，火烟便由大熏窑经地道通小熏窑，熏遍了所有的土块。
    采用三连环熏窑造肥有三大优点：一、全部造肥过程只需十五天，投工二十个，即可熏肥四千担。二、凡有干土块和土垅的地方都可采用。三、采用这种方法，每二担肥只需柴一斤。
