Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: According to TASS, Paris, January 14th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session. Party Secretary Duclos delivered a report yesterday on the political situation and preparations for the municipal elections.

In his report, Duclos analyzed the government's foreign policy and economic and political measures, and pointed out the current tasks of the French Communist Party.

Duclos pointed out that the escalating war in Algeria is imposing unbearable military expenditures on France and making France dependent on foreign loans, especially from the United States and West Germany.

Duclos said that amid the increasing economic contradictions among Western European countries, France has had to devalue the franc and largely abandon the protection of its own industry and trade. These measures have made the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises more difficult and exacerbated the economic recession, leading to a further decline in employment and wages. The French government's policies only benefit large monopoly capital.

Duclos analyzed the government's financial and economic measures, pointing out that monopoly capital is launching an attack on the working people. He also pointed out that the reactionaries' attack on the parliamentary system shows the contradictions and weaknesses among various groups within the bourgeoisie, and also shows the direct and open interference of capitalist monopoly groups in the leadership of state affairs.

Duclos said that for the sake of the people and the country, the policies that attack the people must be bankrupted. To this end, the working class must unite and form an alliance with all others who are harmed by the policies of capitalist monopoly groups to carry out the struggle.

Duclos severely criticized the policy of the leadership of the French Socialist Party to split the working class and the people, pointing out that the leadership of the Socialist Party once colluded with right-wing parties, but now hypocritically talks about its position as a "constructive opposition" to the government. He pointed out that the leaders of the Socialist Party should be responsible for the current situation.

Finally, Duclos outlined the program put forward by the French Communist Party as the basis for unified action by all national forces, and pointed out the great significance of the municipal elections to be held in March this year and the tasks of the Communist Party in the election campaign.

The plenary session adopted the French Communist Party's election program for the municipal elections.

The program outlines the current political and economic situation in France, and suggests that all democratic forces unite and take concerted action on the basis of a national salvation program to block the path of the reactionaries and fascist forces. This national salvation program demands: achieving peace in Algeria through negotiations, reducing military spending, ensuring France's independence, improving the living standards of the working people, and abolishing the government's anti-democratic decrees.

The program also calls for defending the rights and freedoms of autonomous institutions such as municipal councils.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party called on male and female voters to turn this municipal election into "a struggle for democracy and freedom, for peace and against poverty," and called on them to vote for the candidates of the French Communist Party and the candidates supported by the Communist Party.

The plenary session also adopted a resolution on the election campaign strategy for the municipal elections.

The resolution pointed out that the French Communist Party will put forward its own list of candidates in those places where elections are held according to the "proportional representation system," and in those places where elections are conducted according to the "two-round majority system" and where the Communist Party's influence is dominant, and will propose a joint list of candidates with other parties that support the republic before the second round of voting. In other places, a joint list of candidates will be put forward in the first round of voting to isolate the reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 13th: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor learned through trade union organizations and trade union members that workers and trade union members have a strong desire for unity. Benoît Frachon, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, wrote a letter yesterday to the Socialist Party's trade union "Workers' Force," the Catholic Labor Confederation, the General Federation of Civil Servants, and the National Education Federation, requesting to meet with them to prepare for joint action.

In his letter, Frachon recalled that the recent financial and economic measures of the government have seriously hit the working class, so the working class is generally very dissatisfied.

Frachon advocated that all trade union organizations reach an agreement in order to effectively protect the working class. In order to realize this wish, the General Confederation of Labor suggested that contact be established between the central leadership bodies of various trade unions to formulate a joint action plan.

    争取民主自由　击退垄断集团的进攻
    法共号召劳动人民加强斗争
    弗拉商建议法国各工会展开共同行动
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社巴黎14日讯：法国共产党中央委员会举行了全体会议，党的书记杜克洛昨天在会上作了关于政治局势和筹备市政选举的报告。
    杜克洛在报告中分析了政府的外交政策和经济、政治措施，并且指出了法国共产党目前的任务。
    杜克洛指出，阿尔及利亚战争的日益加剧把难以担负的军费开支加在法国身上，并且使法国依赖外国贷款，特别是美国和西德的贷款。
    杜克洛说，在西欧各国之间的经济矛盾日益尖锐的情况下，法国不得不实行法郎贬值，并且在很大程度上放弃对本国的工业和贸易的保护。这些措施使中小企业的处境更加困难，使经济衰退更加严重，以致造成就业和工资的进一步下降。法国政府的政策只对大垄断资本有利。
    杜克洛分析了政府的财政经济措施，指出垄断资本正在对劳动人民展开进攻。他还指出，反动派对议会制度的进攻，表明资产阶级内部各集团之间的矛盾和软弱，也表明资本主义垄断集团对国家事务领导进行直接而公开的干涉。
    杜克洛说，为了人民和国家的利益，必须使进攻人民的政策破产。为此，工人阶级必须团结起来，和遭到资本主义垄断集团的政策之害的其他一切人结成联盟，进行斗争。
    杜克洛严厉抨击法国社会党领导机构分裂工人阶级和人民的政策，指出社会党领导机构曾经和右翼政党勾结在一起，而现在却假惺惺地谈论它对政府的“建设性反对派”的立场。他指出，社会党的领导人应该对目前的局势负责。
    杜克洛最后还概述了法国共产党提出来作为各民族力量统一行动的基础的纲领，并且指出了将在今年3月举行的市政选举的重大意义和共产党在竞选运动中的任务。
    全体会议通过了法国共产党参加市政选举的竞选纲领。
    纲领概述了法国目前的政治、经济形势，建议一切民主力量团结起来，在救国纲领的基础上采取一致行动，以堵住反动派和法西斯势力的道路。这个救国纲领要求：通过谈判方式在阿尔及利亚建立和平，削减军费，保证法国的独立，提高劳动人民的生活水平和废除政府的反民主法令。
    纲领还要求保卫像市议会这样的自治机构的权利和自由。
    法国共产党中央委员会全体会议号召男女选民把这一次市政选举变成“争取民主和自由，争取和平和反对贫穷的斗争”，号召他们投法国共产党候选人和获得共产党支持的候选人的票。
    全体会议还通过了关于市政选举竞选策略的决议。
    决议指出，法国共产党将在那些按“比例代表制”举行选举的地方以及在按“二轮多数制”进行选举而共产党的影响占优势的那些地方，提出自己的候选人名单，并且在第二轮投票以前同拥护共和的其他政党提出联合候选人名单。而在其他一些地方，在第一轮投票中就提出联合候选人名单以孤立反动派。
    新华社巴黎13日电　法国总工会执行局通过工会组织和工会会员了解到劳动者和工会会员有强烈的团结愿望。总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商昨天为此特地写信给社会党工会“工人力量”、天主教劳工联盟、公务员总工会和全国教育联合会，要求同它们会谈，以准备共同行动。
    弗拉商在信中追述说，最近政府的财政经济措施严重地打击了工人阶级，因此工人阶级普遍感到十分不满。
    弗拉商主张所有工会组织达成协议，以便有效地保护工人阶级。为了实现这一愿望，总工会建议各工会中央领导机构之间建立联系，制订共同行动计划。
