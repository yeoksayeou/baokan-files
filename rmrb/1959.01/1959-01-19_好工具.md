    A new tool, if not tested and proven through repeated practical operation, is difficult to gain the praise of farmers. However, the winch-powered machine created by Wuchang County was quickly praised by farmers. They sang, "The winch machine is a treasure; it can do so many jobs!" This powered machine, when equipped with corresponding tools, can be used for almost all farm work and agricultural product processing, and greatly improves labor efficiency and reduces labor intensity. No wonder the farmers of Wuchang like it so much.
    This winch machine mainly uses wood, so the cost is very low, only forty to fifty yuan per unit. Compared with other types of power equipment, it can be considered inexpensive and of good quality.
    Heilongjiang Province is preparing to widely promote the winch machine, and we also plan to provide a more detailed introduction in the future.

    好工具
    一种新工具出现，如果不经多次实地操作检验，很难以得到农民的称道。然而五常县创造的绞关动力机，农民很快就称道开了。他们歌唱说：“绞关机，是件宝，好多活计都能搞”。这种动力机带上相应的工具，差不多许多农活和农产品加工都用得上，而且大大提高了劳动效率，减轻了劳动强度，无怪五常农民是那么喜欢它。
    这种绞关机因为主要用的是木材，造价很低，一部只用四、五十元。同其他几种动力设备比较，算得是价廉物美了。
    黑龙江省准备普遍推广绞关机，我们也计划再作一次比较详细的介绍。
