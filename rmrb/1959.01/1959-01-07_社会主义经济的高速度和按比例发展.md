Two Contradictions Generate Two Requirements

    The purpose of socialist society's production is to satisfy the ever-growing material and cultural needs of all the people. The people's needs are endless, while production has certain limits within a certain period. Therefore, the contradiction between production not meeting needs often occurs. The method to solve this contradiction is to continuously develop production; using the method of continuously developing production to meet the people's ever-growing needs. When production develops, the people's needs are more satisfied; however, the people will put forward even higher demands, prompting further development of production. In order to maximize the satisfaction of the people's living needs, socialist society needs to develop production at a high speed. After the victory of the socialist revolution, the issue of construction speed is the most important issue before us.

    Socialist society's production is highly socialized production. Various industries have a very fine division of labor, and there are thousands or even tens of thousands of kinds of products. A certain proportional relationship must be maintained between them. It is possible that many kinds of products cannot meet social needs, while some kinds of products exceed social needs. Therefore, in addition to the contradiction that production cannot meet needs, socialist society also has the contradiction that the production of various products is not adapted to needs. The solution is to regulate the quantity of production and consumption of various products through national planning, so that the various sectors of the national economy develop as proportionally as possible.

    Because of the above two contradictions existing in socialist society, two requirements arise: the high-speed development of the national economy and the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The contradiction between social production and social needs, which will objectively exist for a long time, requires people to constantly regulate it through national planning." According to my personal understanding, the "contradiction between social production and social needs" mentioned here includes the above two contradictions.

The Key to the High-Speed Development of the National Economy

    Socialist society, due to the abolition of the private ownership of the means of production and the exploitation relations arising therefrom, not only generates the requirement for high-speed development of production but also generates the possibility of high-speed development of production. All social products are ultimately created by social labor. Therefore, to develop production at a high speed, we must first make full use of the nation's labor resources and mobilize all possible labor forces to accelerate socialist construction. Secondly, we must improve labor productivity to ensure that we can create more social products by spending the same amount of labor. In socialist countries, labor resources can be most fully utilized; because only here can the unemployment of workers and the enormous waste of labor in capitalist societies be eliminated. Before liberation, the bourgeoisie regarded the 600 million population as a heavy burden on the country. According to them, this was the root cause of our country's poverty. After liberation, especially during the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, this situation has been completely changed. Now everyone is worried not about overpopulation, but about the lack of labor. From this point, we can see the incomparable superiority of socialism over capitalism.

    Socialist society also has great advantages in improving labor productivity. Lenin said in "A Great Beginning": "Communism is a higher labor productivity than capitalism, created by advanced technology, conscious and voluntary, united workers." Socialist society can use all advanced technologies without hindering the use of advanced technologies for profit like capitalist society. Socialist society can also prioritize the development of heavy industry regardless of profit, creating a material foundation for the widespread use of advanced technologies. In addition, socialist society can rely on the conscious and voluntary labor of the working people. Only the socialist system can fully develop the high initiative and creativity of the working people. Therefore, socialist countries will certainly be able to far surpass capitalist countries in terms of the speed of production development.

    It can be seen that, in order to ensure the high-speed development of the national economy, socialist countries must, on the one hand, prioritize the development of heavy industry and make full use of existing material production conditions, relying on advanced technology to rapidly improve labor productivity. On the other hand, they must also mobilize and organize the working people well, improve their enthusiasm and creativity for production. In a country like ours with a large population and a part of the labor force not fully utilized, mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of working people through material incentives and political and ideological education, and giving full play to their efforts in various production labors, is of great significance for accelerating socialist construction. Here, the idea of emphasizing things and neglecting people is obviously wrong. However, we must not therefore ignore the important role of advanced technology in improving labor productivity, nor can we ignore the importance of regularly conducting economic accounting of labor effects and production costs. Especially when the labor force has been fully utilized, the adoption of advanced technology becomes an important guarantee for high-speed development of production. In order to achieve certain economic development targets, not only must there be sufficient revolutionary drive, but also certain material and technical conditions are needed. It is obviously inappropriate to only advocate hard work without advocating smart work.

High Speed and Proportion are a Unity of Contradictions

    In addition to requiring the high-speed development of the national economy, socialist society also requires the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Socialist society is based on the public ownership of the means of production, which makes it not only necessary but also possible for the national economy to develop in a planned and proportionate manner. The proportional relationship of the national economy is closely related to the speed of development; if the speed of development is different, the proportional relationship will also be different. In Capital, Marx cited the formulas for simple reproduction and expanded reproduction. The former is the proportional relationship of simple reproduction, and the latter is the proportional relationship of expanded reproduction. When we formulate annual plans, especially long-term plans, we often propose several plans, with higher-speed plans and lower-speed plans. High speed has a high-speed proportional relationship, and low speed has a low-speed proportional relationship. When we formulate plans, we must not only maintain a certain proportion among the various sectors of the national economy but also strive for a relatively high speed of development.

    When we formulate national economic plans, we can adopt two different methods for balancing problems: one method is to try every means to make the backward parts catch up with the advanced parts when encountering imbalances, and only slow down the pace of advancement as a last resort. This is an active balancing method. The other method is to easily allow the advanced parts to accommodate the backward parts when encountering imbalances. This is a passive balancing method. Obviously, the latter method is absolutely unacceptable. We must advocate active balancing methods; of course, this does not mean that the objective possibilities can be disregarded when improving the speed of development. The speed must be based on objective possibilities.

    In the development of the national economy, speed and balance are contradictory and unified. From a relatively long period, the development of the national economy must maintain balance; but from each segment, it is often unbalanced. Like lake water, it looks flat from a distance, but waves fluctuate from up close. Therefore, we say that balance is a relative and temporary phenomenon, while imbalance is an absolute and constant phenomenon. Speed and balance are contradictory. The faster the development speed of the national economy, the more difficult it is to maintain calm. Overemphasizing balance and requiring balance at all times and in all places will inevitably limit the development speed of the national economy. However, if the balance is broken, it will also affect the speed of advancement, and even make it impossible to move forward at all. Only by paying attention to the proportionate development of the various sectors of the national economy can human, material, and financial resources be utilized most fully, most rationally, and most effectively. From this perspective, speed and balance are unified, and maintaining balance is also for maintaining the speed of advancement. Formulating national economic plans must not only oppose mechanically pursuing balance and ignoring the speed of development, but also oppose simply pursuing speed and not wanting balance at all. Only in this way can it be possible to ensure the rapid and coordinated development of the national economy.

    The opposition and unity of speed and balance are the main basis for us to consider the proportional relationships of the various sectors of the national economy. For example, under the conditions of prioritizing the development of heavy industries, the parallel development of industry and agriculture, and the parallel development of heavy and light industries, reflect the opposition and unity of speed and balance. Prioritizing the development of heavy industries is to rapidly expand reproduction and ensure the high-speed development of the national economy; while the parallel development of industry and agriculture, and the parallel development of heavy and light industries, are to make the various sectors of the national economy roughly maintain balance and ensure proportionate development. Another example is the guarantee of key points and the consideration of all aspects in the national economic construction, and taking steel as the key link and comprehensive leap forward in industrial construction, also reflect the opposition and unity of speed and balance. Guaranteeing key points and taking steel as the key link mainly represent the speed aspect, while considering all aspects and the comprehensive leap forward mainly represent the balance aspect, which is generally for the high-speed and proportionate development of the national economy.

The Dynamism of People in Choosing Proportional Relationships

    The proportional relationship of the national economy is not fixed. The proportional relationships of various countries are different, and the proportional relationships of a country at various periods are also different. The so-called industrialization of the country, the so-called priority development of heavy industry, is to change the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, and between heavy and light industries. Our national economic construction must constantly break the old proportional relationships and establish new proportional relationships. Therefore, we must not confuse the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy with the specific proportional relationships of the national economy. The law cannot be changed within a certain historical period, while the specific proportional relationships often need to be changed. The proportional relationships of the national economy are ever-changing. Not only does each period have its own proportional relationship, but often several proportional relationships objectively exist for us to choose within a certain period. For example: doing more construction and improving life less; and improving life more and doing less construction, these will have two proportional relationships. Therefore, when choosing proportional relationships, people have considerable dynamism, and the Party's tasks and policies play an important role. However, we must not therefore ignore the objectively existing proportional relationships, thinking that we can do whatever we want according to people's subjective wishes, thinking that people can transform objective laws or even abolish objective laws. It is unacceptable to only see the aspect that objective laws do not shift according to people's will while not seeing people's subjective dynamism; or to only see people's subjective dynamism and completely deny objective laws.

Correctly Grasping the Various Proportional Relationships of the National Economy

    When studying the specific proportional relationships of the national economy, the first thing to study is the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption, and the proportional relationship between means of production and means of consumption that is adapted to this. Socialist countries must first determine how much of the national income is used to maintain and improve the people's lives (consumption), and how much is used for economic construction (accumulation). After determining the quantity of accumulation and consumption, the production of consumer goods must be adapted to the people's living needs (consumption); the production of means of production must be adapted to the needs of economic construction (accumulation). According to the needs of the above aspects, determine the proportional relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. In addition to compensating for the material consumption in production, our heavy industry production must also ensure the supply of machinery and equipment and raw materials, fuels, and electricity required for economic construction; light industry and agriculture must be able to meet the people's various living needs.

    In addition to maintaining the proportional relationship between the two major production sectors, the national economy must also maintain the proportional relationship within each production sector. For example, the proportional relationship between machine production and steel, coal, electricity, etc., the proportional relationship between the textile industry, the food industry, and various raw materials, etc. This kind of proportional relationship is very complex, and the phenomenon of proportional imbalance often occurs. For example, accelerating the development of the machinery manufacturing industry is often restricted by the supply of raw materials such as steel; accelerating the development of the steel industry is often restricted by the supply of coal, ore, electricity, etc. Although such proportional relationships are complex, they are relatively easy to calculate, and imbalances will be exposed quickly when they occur. Therefore, as long as adjustments are made in a timely manner, serious errors can be avoided.

    How consumer goods can meet the people's living needs is a relatively complex issue. The higher the people's living standards, the more complex their demands, and the more difficult it is to meet their needs. The people's living needs are endless; often, the more emphasis is placed on meeting living needs, the higher the people's demands, and the more their needs cannot be met. Therefore, when gradually improving the people's lives, socialist countries must make the speed of life improvement adapt to the speed of production development, and should never exceed the possible limits of life improvement brought about by production development. For this reason, the people must be constantly educated on building the country diligently and thriftily, enduring the current difficulties that cannot be overcome, in order to strive for a better life in the future.

    The most difficult thing for socialist countries to properly arrange is the relationship between the supply of means of production and economic construction. The reason is that, on the one hand, economic construction (mainly heavy industry construction) is certainly the fundamental method to increase the supply of means of production; but on the other hand, construction itself creates a huge need for means of production. Often, the more machines, steel, etc. are in short supply, the more necessary it is to accelerate the construction of heavy industry; but the larger the scale of heavy industry construction, the more likely it is that the supply of machines, steel, etc. will become even tighter, and it seems even more necessary to accelerate the construction of heavy industry. Conversely, when the speed of construction is very slow, the demand for machines, steel, etc. is greatly reduced, and it seems that there is no need to speed up the construction. This gives us some illusions, making us more and more deeply trapped when we make mistakes, and unable to be corrected in a short period of time. When we formulate national economic plans and guide economic work, we must prevent errors in this regard.

We Must Fully Mobilize the Masses and Strengthen Unified Leadership

    Finally, there is also the question of methods to ensure the high-speed development and planned and proportionate development of the national economy. In the past, when we emphasized the planned and proportionate development of the national economy, we emphasized the role of the state more in a certain period and relatively neglected the role of the masses; and in the state, we emphasized the role of the central government more in a certain period and relatively neglected the role of local governments. Adopting this method makes it impossible to ensure the high-speed development of the national economy. Now, we not only adopt the mass movement method to vigorously develop agriculture, but also adopt the same method to vigorously develop industry, thus achieving the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. However, can we therefore say that our economic construction can only have a democratic aspect and no centralized aspect? Of course not. Without a centralized aspect, without unified guidelines, policies, and unified economic plans, it is impossible to ensure the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. Moreover, if the proportional relationship is broken, it is impossible to ensure the high-speed development of the national economy. The rich experience of the past year of 1958 not only proves the importance of fully mobilizing the masses, but also proves the importance of strengthening the Party's unified leadership.

    Unified leadership and decentralized management, the Party's leadership and the mass line, these are two mutually dependent aspects; it is also related to the opposition and unity of speed and balance. Under the guidance of these principles, we advocate that the national economy must be comprehensively planned and divided into labor and cooperation; at the same time, we advocate the parallel development of the central government and local governments, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and foreign methods and local methods. In this way, we can not only fully develop the initiative and creativity of governments at all levels, enterprises, communes, and the broad masses, and ensure the high-speed development of production; but also be able to organize the forces of all parties well and ensure the planned and proportionate development of various regions and sectors of the national economy. Our national plan should not manage too much or too rigidly, so as to shackle the initiative and creativity of local governments, enterprises, communes, and the broad masses. However, we should not adopt a laissez-faire attitude and let the national economy fall into a state of anarchy. Both of these must be resolutely opposed.

    社会主义经济的高速度和按比例发展
    薛暮桥
    两种矛盾产生两种要求
    社会主义社会生产的目的，是为满足全体人民日益增长的物质和文化生活需要。人民的生活需要是无止境的，而生产在一定的时期内却有一定的限度，因此就经常发生生产满足不了需要的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的方法，是不断地发展生产；用不断地发展生产的方法，来满足人民日益增长的生活需要。生产发展了，人民的生活需要就较多地得到满足了；但是，人民又会提出更加高的要求，促使生产进一步地发展。社会主义社会为着最大限度满足人民的生活需要，就有必要高速度地发展生产。在社会主义革命胜利以后，建设的速度问题是摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。
    社会主义社会的生产是高度社会化的生产，各行各业分工很细，各种产品有几千种、上万种，在它们之间必须保持一定的比例关系。很可能出现这样的情况，许多种产品满足不了社会需要，而某几种产品则超过社会需要。因此社会主义社会除存在着生产满足不了需要的矛盾外，还存在着各种产品生产同需要不相适应的矛盾。解决的方法是通过国家计划来调节各种产品的生产和消费的数量，使国民经济各部门尽可能按比例地发展。
    社会主义社会由于存在着上述两个矛盾，因此就产生出两个要求：国民经济高速度发展，国民经济有计划按比例发展。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”中指出：“在客观上将会长期存在的社会生产和社会需要之间的矛盾，就需要人们时常经过国家计划去调节”。这里所说的“社会生产和社会需要之间的矛盾”，根据我个人的理解，是把上述两个矛盾都包括在内了。
    国民经济高速度发展的关键
    社会主义社会由于废除了生产资料的私有制度和由此所产生的剥削关系，因此不但产生了高速度发展生产的要求，而且产生了高速度发展生产的可能。一切社会产品，归根到底都是由社会劳动所创造的。所以，要高速度发展生产，首先就要充分利用全国的劳动资源，动员一切可能利用的劳动力来加速社会主义建设；其次就要提高劳动生产率，保证我们能够花费同样多的劳动来创造更多的社会产品。在社会主义国家，劳动资源可以得到最充分的利用；因为只有在这里，才能够消灭资本主义社会劳动者的失业和劳动力的巨大浪费现象。我国在解放前，资产阶级把六亿人口看做是国家的沉重的负担，据他们说这是我国贫困的根本原因。解放后，特别是在工农业生产的大跃进中，这种情况已经彻底改变，现在大家忧虑的已不是人口过多，而是劳动力的不足了。从这点，就可以看到社会主义比资本主义有无可比拟的优越性。
    在提高劳动生产率方面，社会主义社会也有很大的优越性。列宁在“伟大的创举”中说：“共产主义就是利用先进技术的、自觉自愿的、联合起来的工人所创造出来的较资本主义更高的劳动生产率”。社会主义社会能够利用一切先进技术，不至于像资本主义社会那样为着赢利而阻碍先进技术的利用；社会主义社会还能够不管赢利多少而优先发展重工业，为先进技术的广泛利用创造物质基础。此外，社会主义社会还能够依靠劳动人民自觉自愿的劳动，只有社会主义制度才能够充分发挥劳动人民高度的积极性和创造性。因此，社会主义国家一定能够在生产发展的速度方面，远远超过资本主义国家。
    由此可见，社会主义国家为着保证国民经济的高速度发展，一方面必须优先发展重工业和充分利用现有的物质生产条件，依靠先进技术来迅速提高劳动生产率；另一方面又必须很好地动员和组织劳动人民，提高他们生产的积极性和创造性。像我们这样一个人口众多，一部分劳动力还没有充分利用的国家，通过物质鼓励和政治思想教育来动员和组织广大劳动人民，鼓足干劲从事各种生产劳动，对加速社会主义建设有着极其重要的意义。在这里，重物轻人的思想显然是错误的。但是，我们决不能够因此就忽视先进技术对提高劳动生产率的重要作用，决不能够忽视对劳动效果和生产成本经常进行经济核算的重要性。特别在劳动力已经得到充分利用的时候，采用先进技术就成为高速度发展生产的重要的保证。为了实现一定的经济发展指标，不仅要有充分的革命干劲，而且需要一定的物质技术条件。只提倡苦干、不提倡巧干，这种作法也显然是不妥当的。
    高速度和按比例是矛盾的统一社会主义社会除要求国民经济的高速度发展外，还要求国民经济的有计划按比例发展。社会主义社会是以生产资料的公有制度为基础的，这就使国民经济不但有必要，而且有可能有计划按比例地发展。国民经济的比例关系，同发展速度是密切关联的；如果发展速度不同，比例关系也就跟着不同。马克思在资本论中举出了简单再生产的公式和扩大再生产的公式，前者是简单再生产的比例关系，后者是扩大再生产的比例关系。我们在编制年度计划、特别是长期计划时候，往往提出几个方案，有较高速度的方案，有较低速度的方案，高速度有高速度的比例关系，低速度有低速度的比例关系。我们在编制计划时候不仅必须使国民经济各部门保持了一定的比例，而且必须争取比较高的发展速度。
    我们在编制国民经济计划的时候，对平衡问题可以采取两种不同的方法：一种方法是在遇到不平衡的时候，千方百计地使落后部分赶上先进部分，只有在万不得已的时候才放慢前进的速度。这是积极的平衡方法。另一种方法是在遇到不平衡的时候，毫不费力地让先进部分迁就落后部分。这是消极的平衡方法。显然，后一种方法是万万要不得的。我们要提倡积极的平衡方法；当然，这也并不是说在提高发展速度时候，可以不考虑客观的可能性，速度必须建立在客观可能性的基础上。
    在国民经济发展中，速度和平衡是矛盾的、又是统一的。国民经济的发展从比较长的时期来讲，必须保持平衡；但从每一个片段来讲，则常常是不平衡的。像湖水一样，从大处看是平的，从小处看则波浪起伏。因此我们说，平衡是相对的、暂时的现象，而不平衡则是绝对的、经常的现象。速度同平衡是矛盾的，国民经济发展的速度愈快，就愈难保持风平浪静。过分强调平衡，要求做到时时平衡，处处平衡，就必然会限制国民经济的发展速度。但是，如果平衡破坏，也就会影响前进的速度，甚至根本不能前进。只有注意到国民经济各部门的按比例的发展，才能最充分地、最合理地和最有效地利用人力、物力和财力。从这方面来讲，速度和平衡又是统一的，保持平衡也是为着保持前进的速度。编制国民经济计划既要反对机械追求平衡，忽视发展速度；也要反对单纯追求速度，根本不要平衡，这样才有可能保证国民经济迅速地、协调地向前发展。
    速度同平衡的对立和统一，是我们考虑国民经济各部门的比例关系的主要根据。比如，在优先发展重工业的条件下，工业同农业并举，重工业同轻工业并举，就表现着速度同平衡的对立和统一。优先发展重工业，是为迅速扩大再生产，保证国民经济的高速度发展；而工业同农业并举、重工业同轻工业并举，则为使国民经济各部门大体上保持平衡，保证按比例地发展。又如国民经济建设中的保证重点和照顾全面，工业建设中的以钢为纲和全面跃进，也表现着速度同平衡的对立和统一。保证重点、以钢为纲，这主要代表着速度这一方面，而照顾全面和全面跃进，则主要代表着平衡这一方面，总的来讲是为着国民经济的高速度和按比例发展。
    人在选择比例关系中的能动性
    国民经济的比例关系不是固定不变的，各个国家的比例关系不同，一个国家各个时期的比例关系也不同。所谓国家的工业化，所谓优先发展重工业，就是改变工业同农业、重工业同轻工业的比例关系。我们的国民经济建设要不断地打破旧的比例关系，建立新的比例关系。因此，不能把国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，同国民经济的具体的比例关系混淆起来。规律在一定历史时期内是不能改变的，而具体的比例关系则经常需要改变。国民经济的比例关系千变万化，不但一个时期有一个时期的比例关系，而且在一定的时期内，客观上也常常存在几种比例关系，让我们来选择。比如：多进行建设、少改善生活；和多改善生活、少进行建设，这就会有两种比例关系。因此，在选择比例关系的时候，人们有相当大的能动性，党的任务和方针政策起着重要的作用。但也决不能够因此就忽视客观存在着的比例关系，认为可以根据人们的主观愿望为所欲为，以为人们可以改造客观规律甚至取消客观规律。只看到客观规律不以人们的意志为转移这一方面，而看不到人们的主观能动性；或者只看到人们的主观能动性而根本否认客观规律，都是要不得的。
    正确掌握国民经济的各种比例关系在研究国民经济具体的比例关系时候，首先需要研究的是积累和消费的比例关系，和与此相适应的生产资料同消费资料的比例关系。社会主义国家首先必须确定把国民收入的多少部分用于保持和改善人民生活（消费），多少部分用于经济建设（积累）。在确定了积累和消费的数量以后，要使消费资料的生产，同人民的生活需要（消费）相适应；生产资料的生产，同经济建设（积累）的需要相适应。根据上述各方面的需要，来确定重工业、轻工业和农业间的比例关系。我们的重工业生产，除补偿生产中的物资消耗外，还必须保证经济建设所需要的机器设备和原料、燃料、电力等的供应；轻工业和农业必须能够满足人民各方面的生活需要。
    国民经济除必须保持两大生产部门的比例关系外，还必须保持各生产部门内部的比例关系。例如机器生产同钢铁、煤炭、电力等的比例关系，纺织工业、食品工业同各种原料之间的比例关系等。这一类的比例关系十分复杂，常常会发生比例失调的现象。如加速发展机器制造工业，就往往会受到钢铁等原料供应的限制；加速发展钢铁工业，就往往会受到煤炭、矿石、电力等供应的限制。这样的比例关系虽然复杂，但是比较容易计算，遇有不平衡的时候很快就会暴露出来。所以只要及时调整，可以不致于犯严重错误。
    消费资料如何适合人民生活需要，是一个比较复杂的问题。人民的生活水平愈高，他们的要求就愈复杂，愈不容易满足需要。人民的生活需要是无止境的；往往愈强调满足生活需要，人民的要求就愈高，他们的需要反而更加不能满足。所以社会主义国家在逐步改善人民生活的时候，必须使生活改善的速度同生产发展的速度相适应，决不应当超越生产发展所带来的生活改善的可能限度。为此必须对人民经常进行勤俭建国的教育，忍受目前还不能克服的困难，来争取将来的更美好的生活。
    社会主义国家最难适当安排的是生产资料供应同经济建设间的关系。原因是，经济建设（主要是重工业建设）一方面固然是增加生产资料供应的根本方法；但是另一方面，建设本身又造成了对生产资料的庞大的需要。往往有这样的情形，机器、钢铁等供应愈缺乏，就愈有必要加速重工业的建设；但重工业的建设规模愈大，则机器、钢铁等的供应有可能反而更加紧张，似乎更非加速重工业的建设不可。反之，在建设速度很慢的情况下，机器、钢铁等的需要量就大大减少，似乎反而没有必要加快建设的速度了。这样就给我们一些错觉，使我们犯了错误的时候有可能愈陷愈深，在短时期内不能得到纠正。在我们编制国民经济计划和指导经济工作的时候，必须防止这方面的错误。
  既要充分发动群众又要加强统一领导
    最后，还有保证国民经济的高速度发展和有计划按比例发展的方法问题。过去我们在强调国民经济的有计划按比例发展时，有一时期较多地强调国家的作用，比较忽视群众的作用；而且在国家方面，有一时期较多地强调中央的作用，比较忽视地方的作用。采取这种方法，就不可能保证国民经济的高速度发展。现在，我们不但采用群众运动的方法来放手发展农业，而且采用同样的方法来放手发展工业，因而出现了工农业生产的大跃进。但是，能否因此就说，我们的经济建设可以只有民主的一面，而没有集中的一面呢？当然不能。如果没有集中的一面，如果没有统一的方针、政策和统一的经济计划，就不可能保证国民经济的有计划按比例发展。而且，如果比例关系破坏，也就不可能保证国民经济的高速度发展。1958年一年来的丰富经验，不但证明了充分发动群众的重要性，而且也证明了加强党的统一领导的重要性。
    统一领导同分级管理、党的领导同群众路线，这是互相依存的两个方面；它同速度同平衡的对立和统一又是互相联系的。在这些原则的指导下，我们主张国民经济必须全面规划、分工协作；同时提倡中央同地方并举，大型企业同中小型企业并举，洋办法同土办法并举。这样，就既能够充分发挥各级地方政府、企业、公社和广大群众的主动性、创造性，保证生产的高速度发展；又能够把各方面的力量很好地组织起来，保证各地区和国民经济各部门有计划按比例发展。我们的国家计划不应该管得过多过死，以致束缚地方、企业、公社和广大群众的主动性、创造性。但是，也不应该采取放任自流的态度，使国民经济陷入无政府状态。这两者都是必须坚决反对的。
