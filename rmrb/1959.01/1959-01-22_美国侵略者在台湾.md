Xinhua News Agency, January 21st – Recent Taiwanese newspapers have continuously revealed the atrocities committed by American aggressors in Taiwan.

Atrocities!

On the evening of the 4th, a tragic incident occurred at Kaohsiung Port, Taiwan. Four U.S. Navy personnel, including Petty Officer Manganes, were driving a small landing craft and recklessly cruising within Kaohsiung Port. When the landing craft reached Pier No. 3, they deliberately crashed into a Taiwanese wooden boat anchored on the water. Two people on the wooden boat fell into the sea. The wind and waves were strong at the time, and an elderly man named Lin Changshou struggled in the sea for a long time, repeatedly calling for help. However, Petty Officer Manganes and others on the small landing craft laughed and refused to rescue him. Lin Changshou drowned, and the other crew member who fell into the water was also swept away by the waves, his body unrecoverable. According to Taiwanese newspapers, after this tragedy, the U.S. military authorities considered Kaohsiung Port to be a U.S. military port and described Manganes' intentional killing as "accidental death," refusing to punish the culprit. Similar U.S. military atrocities occur frequently in Taiwan. According to Taiwan's "United Daily News," on December 22nd of last year, an American soldier named Clark in Taipei hired a pedicab driver, Zhou Huiming, to take him from dozens of miles away to the Jingya Hotel on Jinxi Street. When Zhou Huiming asked him for the fare, he beat Zhou Huiming until he was bruised and bleeding, and he collapsed to the ground. Large numbers of American soldiers have recently poured into Tainan and Pingtung, often causing trouble in bars, cinemas, and public places. Even a female ticket seller at a park entrance was insulted by American soldiers.

Such "Privileges"

The Kaohsiung City Kuomintang "Police Bureau" recently uncovered a large smuggling ring run by American soldiers. In just one search, the smuggled goods seized were worth more than 100,000 Taiwan dollars. This smuggling ring, under the guise of military transportation, had been buying silver dollars in Taiwan for a long time, transferring them to Hong Kong for sale, and then purchasing goods from Hong Kong to smuggle back to Taiwan for sale, making huge profits. A Taipei newspaper said that these American soldiers enjoy "privileges" in Taiwan and are still "at large." The Chiang Kai-shek clique can only swallow their anger regarding smuggling.

In Taiwan, there are high-class hotels, restaurants, and clubs run by Americans everywhere, which are dens of vice where American adventurers indulge in drinking and gambling. Taiwan's "United Daily News" said that the Americans running these "businesses" believe they enjoy "privileges" and refuse to pay taxes to the Taiwanese authorities; and the Taiwanese authorities "know this, but are helpless." In addition, these high-class hotels, restaurants, and clubs have "strict access control" and do not allow ordinary Chinese people to enter. Taiwan's "United Daily News" lamented: "Based on this point alone, it is nothing less than a disguised concession."

John Calvin, known as the "King of American Magicians," and others, arrived in Taiwan aboard their yacht "Troubadour" some time ago to perform "American magic," earning more than 460,000 Taiwan dollars, but owing more than 50,000 Taiwan dollars in "consolidated income tax."

The "Taipei Tax Office" has repeatedly sent people to demand the tax arrears from this "American magician," but Calvin and his companions, using the excuse that Americans enjoy "privileges," refused to accept the tax bill and even scolded the Taipei tax officials for being "unreasonable" and "barbaric." Soon, this "American magician," without completing any departure or ship departure formalities, secretly sailed away in his yacht at night. Before leaving, he also stole two watches in Keelung City.

Although this yacht was later intercepted by Chiang's military speedboats, Calvin insisted that he had entered "international waters" and that the Taiwanese authorities had no right to interfere. He forcibly sailed the yacht directly to the Philippines.

The So-Called "Sino-American Cooperation"

A shipbuilding company in Taiwan was targeted by the tycoons of the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation, who claimed they wanted to invest, and used fraudulent means to annex it, renaming it the American Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation. This American company, claiming to have the latest shipbuilding technology, initially said it would build two large oil tankers in Taiwan. However, nearly two years after the company was established, no ships had been built. Instead, it had already defrauded the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Bank of Taiwan" of nine million U.S. dollars in the name of "loans," and now it is threatening the "Bank of Taiwan" to lend another three million U.S. dollars, otherwise it will "go bankrupt." This major fraud case has aroused great indignation among the "supervisors" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Control Yuan," who "fiercely criticized" Yang Jisheng, the "Minister of Economic Affairs" of the Taiwan Kuomintang, and Zhang Zikai, the "Chairman of the Bank of Taiwan," at a recent meeting.

Another American fraud case involves the "Taiwan Fertilizer Company" in Taipei, which wants to build its sixth factory. The total construction cost is more than 28.8 million U.S. dollars, which will be built by the American Hydrocarbon Research Company. According to the agreement between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek sides, the construction time was two years and should have been completed in October 1956. However, after the American company fraudulently obtained all the construction funds, it repeatedly delayed construction. To date, it is more than two years overdue, and the Fertilizer Sixth Factory is still unable to start production. According to Taiwanese newspaper reports, due to the American company's cutting corners in the construction of this project, some of the machines already installed in the Sixth Factory have been constantly damaged during trial operation, and the factory buildings built are also substandard and must be redesigned. However, the American capitalists in charge of this construction project are desperately playing tricks and refusing to compensate for the losses.

Taiwanese newspapers have therefore scolded the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation and Hydrocarbon Research Company as "foreign swindlers" and "bloodsuckers." Taiwan's "United Daily News" commented on the Fertilizer Sixth Factory incident, saying that this kind of "so-called Sino-American cooperation" has already caused "serious deviations."

    美国侵略者在台湾
    新华社21日讯　最近的台湾报纸，不断透露出美国侵略者在台湾的暴行。
    暴行！
    4日晚上，台湾高雄港口发生一件惨案。美国海军人员下士曼格奈斯等四名，驾驶一只小型登陆艇，在高雄港内横冲直撞，当登陆艇驶到三号码头时，故意将停在海面上一只台湾木船撞碎。木船上的两个人掉入了大海，当时风浪很大，其中一个名叫林长寿的老年人，在海上挣扎很久，一再求救，美军下士曼格奈斯等却在小型登陆艇上哈哈大笑，不去救他。林长寿当时被淹死了，另一个落水船员也被大浪卷走，尸体无法寻找。据台湾报纸说，这件惨案发生后，美军当局认为高雄港是美军的军港，把曼格奈斯有意杀人说成“误丧人命”，拒绝惩办凶手。类似这样的美军暴行，在台湾不断发生。据台湾“联合报”透露，去年12月22日，在台北市有个名叫克拉克的美军，叫三轮车夫周惠铭从几十里以外把他送到锦西街上的静雅旅社。当周惠铭向他要车钱时，他竟把周惠铭打得皮破血流，昏倒在地。台南屏东市最近涌到大批美军，经常在酒吧、电影院和公共场所闹事，连公园门口的女收票员也被美军污辱。
    如此“特权”
    高雄市国民党“警察局”，最近破获了一个由美军主持的庞大的走私集团，仅一次搜查出的走私货物，就值台币十万余元。这个走私集团长期以来，以军运为名，在台湾收购银元，转运到香港脱手，再由香港购运物品走私到台湾出售，从中大发洋财。台北一家报纸说，这些美军由于在台湾享有“特权”，仍然“逍遥法外”，蒋介石集团对走私只恐忍气吞声。
    在台湾，到处有美国人开办的高级旅馆、酒楼、俱乐部等藏垢纳秽的场所，专供美国冒险家们纵酒滥赌。台湾“联合报”说，经营这些“企业”的美国人自认为享有“特权”，拒绝向台湾当局缴纳捐税；而台湾当局“明知此事，竟无可奈何”。此外，这些高级旅馆、酒楼、俱乐部等“严立门禁”，不许一般中国人进门。台湾“联合报”感叹道：“就凭这一点，已经不啻为变相的租界了”。
    号称“美国魔术师”大王的约翰·卡文等人，乘着他们的游艇“伶人号”，不久前到台湾表演“美国魔术”，赚了四十六万余元台币，但是拖欠了五万余元台币的“综合所得税”。
    “台北税务处”曾多次派人去向这个“美国魔术师”索取欠税，但是卡文和他的同伴，竟以美国人享有“特权”为借口，拒绝接受税单，并且大骂台北税务人员“无理”和“野蛮”。不久，这位“美国魔术师”没有办理任何离台和船舶出港手续，在夜间悄悄地驾驶游艇逃走。行前，他还在基隆市偷了两只手表。
    这艘游艇后来虽然被蒋军快艇截获，但卡文硬说已入“公海”，台湾当局无权干涉，他仍强自驾着游艇直航菲律宾。
    所谓“中美合作”
    台湾有一家造船公司，被美国英加尔斯造船公司的大亨们看中了，说要投资，以诈骗的手段吞并了它，改成美国英加尔斯台湾造船公司。这家自称拥有最新造船技术的美国公司，开始时曾经说过，要在台湾建造两艘大油轮，但公司成立时近两年，什么船也没有造出来，却已经向蒋介石集团的“台湾银行”以“借款”名义骗走了九百万美元，现在又要“台湾银行”再借三百万美元，否则就以“倒闭”相要挟。这件大骗案，引起蒋介石集团“监察院”的“监委”们极大愤慨，在最近举行的一次会议上，“激烈抨击”了台湾国民党“经济部部长”杨继曾和“台湾银行董事长”张兹闓。
    另外一宗美国人的骗案是，台北的“台湾肥料公司”要兴建第六厂，全部建造费共计二千八百余万美元，由美国炭氢化合物研究公司承建。依照美蒋双方约定，建厂时间为两年，应该在1956年10月完成。但是，美国公司把全部建造工程费骗到手以后，一再拖延施工，迄今逾期两年多，肥料第六厂仍不能开工生产。据台湾报纸消息，由于这个美国公司在建造这项工程中偷工减料，第六厂已安装的一部分机器在试运转时，不断发生损坏，而且盖起的厂房也不合标准，必须重新设计。但是负责这项建造工程的美国资本家拼命耍赖，拒绝赔偿损失。
    台湾报纸为此大骂美国英加尔斯造船公司和炭氢化合物研究公司等是“洋骗子”、“吸血虫”。台湾“联合报”就台湾肥料第六厂的事件发表评述说，这样的“所谓中美合作”，已经造成了“严重的偏差”。（附图片）
