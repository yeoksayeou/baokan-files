    Combining Theory with Practice, Applying Knowledge
    Beijing Foreign Languages Institute English Department Reforms Teaching Methods

    (Our Dispatch) The English Department's third-year students at Beijing Foreign Languages Institute are achieving particularly strong academic results this semester. They are now capable of translating literary works and conducting research into English language, grammar, and vocabulary. This represents a new achievement, previously unseen in third-year students.
    The English Department's third year comprises one hundred and fifty students divided into ten classes. The ten English teachers have also formed a teaching group. Under the leadership of the Party Branch, teachers and student representatives hold regular meetings to continuously study teaching methods based on the Party's educational guidelines, thereby successfully implementing teaching reforms and achieving significant results in a short period of time.
    Last semester, the school criticized the past tendency in English teaching to be divorced from politics and reality, pointing out that the selection of teaching materials rarely considered the state's political requirements for cultivating talent or the students' actual needs. Instead, it focused solely on literary techniques and teachers' interests, leading students to spend their entire time in the English Department circling around 18th and 19th-century literary works. After graduating, students struggled to even translate editorials from the People's Daily into English smoothly. At the beginning of this semester, the teachers responsible for third-year teaching first changed the teaching materials to English articles related to the current domestic and international situation. After studying them, the students could use them to discuss current affairs and express their political thoughts and feelings, thus boosting their motivation to learn compared to the past. In classrooms and dormitories alike, the sounds of practicing speaking with new English vocabulary filled the air. During the two-week intensive vocabulary period, each student memorized 1,500 new words and read approximately 30,000 words of English articles. Based on student feedback, teachers also introduced a "unit teaching method" with one central theme per week, ensuring a prominent teaching focus, clear objectives, and close integration of learning and application, with reading, writing, listening, and speaking mutually reinforcing each other. Teachers also assisted students in organizing mutual aid groups, leveraging collective strength to delve into certain issues, allowing teachers to concentrate on systematically and deeply teaching key topics.
    Following the new teaching methods, students have completed the courses on People's Communes, Imperialism is a Paper Tiger, the Great Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture, and the Taiwan issue, reading over 100,000 words of materials. Each student has also written several compositions. Everyone feels that what they have learned is deeply imprinted and applicable. After the publication of Hu Yaobang's report "Promote Communist Spirit and Strive to Build Socialism," the fourth class adopted a collective division of labor method to translate it into English within eight hours. Teachers found this to be a good method, both for learning new knowledge and consolidating existing knowledge. The Party Branch and teachers promoted this method to students in each class. All the classes became active: some translated fragments of literary works such as "My Family" and "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," while others conducted surveys and organized political and economic vocabulary. All the teachers went to the classes to provide guidance, recommend writing topics to students, answer difficult questions, and provide specific assistance to students with weaker foundations.
    Most teachers and students believe that the academic achievements of the third-year students are the result of implementing the new teaching methods, and that the good combination of teachers and students is particularly important. Teachers played a guiding role in teaching, and students demonstrated initiative in learning.

    结合实际  学以致用
    北京外语学院英语系改革教学方法
    本报讯　北京外国语学院英语系三年级学生这学期的学习成绩特别好。他们已能翻译文艺作品，并进行英语、语法、词汇的研究。这是过去三年级未曾有过的新气象。
    英语系三年级有一百五十人，分十个班。十位英文教师也组成了一个教学小组。在党总支领导下，教师和学生代表经常举行会议，根据党的教育方针不断地研究教学，从而比较顺利地进行了教学改革，在很短的时间里就收到了明显的效果。
    上学期，这个学校批判了过去英文教学上脱离政治脱离实际的倾向，指出过去选用教材既很少考虑国家培养人材的政治要求，也很少考虑学生的实际需要，一味强调文学技巧和教师的兴趣，使学生从进入英文系一直到毕业都在十八、十九世纪的文学作品里兜圈子。学生走出学校后，连像人民日报上的许多社论文章也不能顺利地翻译成英文。本学期开学后，负责三年级教学工作的教师们首先改用和当前国内外形势有关的英文文章作教材。学生们学了后就能用来谈论时事，表达自己的政治思想感情，因此学习的劲头比过去大了。教室里，宿舍里，到处是运用英文新词汇练习说话的声音。在突击生字的两周内，学生每人记住了一千五百个生词，阅读了约三万字的英文文章。教师们根据学生的意见，又提出了一周一个中心的“单元教学法”使一周的教学中心突出，目标明确，学用紧密结合，读、写、听、说互相促进。教师并协助学生们组织互助组，运用集体力量钻研一些问题，使教师能集中力量系统深入地讲授主要问题。
    学生们按照新的教学方法，已经学完了人民公社、帝国主义是纸老虎、工农业大跃进、台湾问题四个单元的课程，阅读过的材料达十多万字，每人还写了一些作文。大家都感到已学的东西印象深而且会使用。胡耀邦的“发扬共产主义精神努力建设社会主义”的报告发表后，第四班的学生采用集体分工的方法，在八小时内就把它译成了英文。教师们发现这是个好方法，既可学到新知识，又可巩固已学的知识。党总支和教师们就向各班学生推广这个方法。各个班都活跃起来了：有的翻译“我的一家”、“星火燎原”等文学作品的片段，有的进行关于政治、经济词汇的调查和整理。教师们全都到班内指导，向学生们推荐写作题材，解答一些疑难问题，对基础差的学生进行具体帮助。
    多数师生们认为三年级学生的学习成绩是实行新的教学方法的结果，其中特别重要的是教师和学生结合得好。教师在教学上发挥了指导作用，学生们在学习中发挥了主动精神。
