Puerto Rico, this island nation in the Caribbean, became a Spanish colony in the sixteenth century (1509). At the end of the nineteenth century (1898), American colonialists replaced the Spanish colonialists. Although in 1952, due to the resistance of the Puerto Rican people, American colonialists were forced to allow Puerto Rico to have "autonomy" and beautified the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico as a so-called "free federation," the United States still holds significant power. The U.S. Congress, the U.S. President, and the U.S. Supreme Court all have veto power over the corresponding institutions of Puerto Rico. The FBI also has a large intelligence apparatus in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is, in reality, still an American colony.

Puerto Rico has an area of 3,800 square miles (including nearby small islands) and a total population of approximately 2.5 million. If we include the expatriates who have been forced to flee to the United States (approximately 1 million) and other countries over the years, the total reaches 4 million. Although Puerto Rico has abundant mineral resources, they are hardly exploited. The main product is sugarcane, a single crop controlled by American monopoly capital. The Morgan banking syndicate's sugar companies control almost all arable land through a small number of large landowners. This island nation of 2.5 million people often has around 300,000 unemployed. Puerto Rico has long been known as the "Island of Hunger" and "one of the most miserable regions in the world." As the leader of the Puerto Rican Masonic Lodge, Santalya, said, American colonial rule has made the Puerto Rican people "backward, impoverished, and suffering."

However, the United States not only imposes colonial enslavement on Puerto Rico but is also turning it into a large-scale U.S. land, sea, and air military base. There are now eleven such military bases, one of which is used for launching missiles. Some bases, such as the Ensenada Honda naval and air base, cover an area of more than twenty square miles, occupying four-fifths of Vieques Island. It is the largest military base outside the continental United States in the Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of the original 100,000 residents of the island have been forced to move. This small island, which was once a productive area for sugarcane, other crops, and animal husbandry, is now completely deserted. U.S. military bases are spread all over the island, surrounded by barbed wire, with signs that say "Federal Property" and prohibit passage. The United States also implements a so-called "selective service" conscription system in Puerto Rico. In February of last year alone, it "selected" 1,272 Puerto Rican youths to serve in the U.S. military.

The people of Puerto Rico cannot tolerate this colonial enslavement and the brutal act of being forced into becoming instruments of war. The Puerto Rican Communist Party, the Independence Party, and many social groups and political organizations, together with the Puerto Rican people, have continuously launched independence movements to break away from American colonial rule.

    要求独立的波多黎各
    波多黎各，这个加勒比海中的岛国，十六世纪起（1509年）就沦为西班牙的殖民地，十九世纪末（1898年）美国殖民者又取代了西班牙殖民者。虽然在1952年，由于波多黎各人民的反抗，美国殖民者被迫允许波多黎各“自治”，并且把美国和波多黎各的关系美化为所谓“自由联邦”，但是美国仍是大权在握，美国国会、美国总统和美国最高法院，都对波多黎各的各相应机构操有否决权力。美国的联邦调查局在波多黎各也有着庞大的特务机构。波多黎各实际上仍然是美国的殖民地。
    波多黎各面积三千八百平方英里（包括附近小岛），人口总数约二百五十万人，如果算上连年被迫流亡到美国（约一百万人）和其他国家的侨民，总数达四百万人。波多黎各矿藏虽然很丰富，但几乎没有开采，主要产品是由美国大垄断资本操纵的单一农作物——甘蔗。美国摩根财团的糖公司通过少数大地主几乎控制着全部耕地。这个二百五十万人口的岛国，经常有三十万人左右的失业者。波多黎各长久以来被人称作“饥饿之岛”和“世界上最悲惨的地区之一”。正如波多黎各共济会领导人桑台尔亚所说的，美国的殖民统治使得波多黎各人民“落后、贫困和痛苦”。
    但是，美国不仅把殖民奴役强加在波多黎各，而且还正把它变成美国的大型陆海空军事基地。这种军事基地现在已达十一个，其中一个是发射导弹用的；有的基地如恩塞那达昂达的海空军基地，面积达二十多平方英里，占用了维埃凯斯岛的五分之四的地区，是西半球大陆以外的最大军事基地；原来曾经居住在岛上的十万居民绝大部分都被迫移走了，这个小岛原是甘蔗、其他农作物和畜牧业的丰产地，现在完全荒芜了。遍布全岛的美国军事基地都用铁丝网围着，上面挂着“联邦财产”和禁止通行的牌子。美国还在波多黎各实行所谓“选拔服役”的义务兵役制，仅仅在去年2月份一个月内就“选拔”了一千二百七十二个波多黎各青年去服美国的兵役。
    波多黎各人民不能忍受这种殖民奴役和迫充战争工具的残暴行为。波多黎各共产党、独立党以及很多社会团体和政治组织同波多黎各人民一起曾不断地展开争取摆脱美国殖民统治的独立运动。（美）
