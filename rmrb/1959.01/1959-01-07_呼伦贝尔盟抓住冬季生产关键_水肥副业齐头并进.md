*Neimenggu Ribao* [Inner Mongolia Daily] message: In Hulunbuir League's rural areas, the production focus shifted to water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and winter sideline production in late December of last year.

Local areas have all divided their battlefronts, strengthened leadership, and put forward the resounding slogan of "ensuring that satellite fields and basic fields are well-fed and well-watered." According to statistics from five banners including Ke Right Front Banner and Butha Banner, the number of people invested in water conservancy construction reached more than 55,000. Among them, Ke Right Front Banner surged from 9,000 people in mid-December of last year to 22,000 people. The entire league has opened more than 2,900 wells, opened 112 canals, and built 76 small reservoirs, and is actively preparing to realize river networking and garden plots. By the end of December last year, Hailar City suburbs and various banners and counties had held eight garden plot training classes, training about 1,000 people. Various localities have also sent 250 people, including responsible persons of banners and counties, commune chairmen, and party committee secretaries, to Hebei, Henan, Anhui and other places to learn the experience of garden plots and river networking; twenty old peasants recently invited from the suburbs of Hohhot have begun to teach garden plot experience in various agricultural banners and counties.

The movement to accumulate fertilizer, smoke fertilizer, and make fertilizer is being carried out universally throughout the league. According to statistics at the end of last year, 77 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, accounting for 53.47% of this year's total demand. Tuquan County and Butha Banner have established 593 local fertilizer plants, and Ke Right Front Banner has produced 5 million jin of local fertilizer.

All banners and counties have made arrangements for winter sideline production, formulated plans to increase income, and organized sideline production brigades. Some places have achieved remarkable results. Ergun Right Banner has already caught 220,000 jin of fish. They plan to draw 25% of the labor force while completing water and fertilizer tasks to engage in sideline production such as fishing, hunting, transporting wood, and cleaning forest farms, striving to increase income by 2 million yuan within a hundred days. The 3,000-strong sideline production army of Ke Right Front Banner has actively launched activities and has now earned 800,000 yuan, planning to increase net sideline income by 5 million yuan by the end of April 1959. Butha Banner draws 30% of the labor force to carry out multiple sideline productions such as wild boar hunting, mat weaving, and manual labor in a planned and organized manner, ensuring that the average rural income increases by ten yuan per person this winter and next spring.

More than 10,000 employees in the league's commercial system have expressed their willingness to do a good job in the procurement of local and sideline products and the supply of materials, so as to promote the faster development of diversified operations in people's communes. (Attached Picture)

    呼伦贝尔盟抓住冬季生产关键
    水肥副业齐头并进
    内蒙古日报消息　呼伦贝尔盟农村，在去年12月下旬已将生产中心转向水利、积肥和冬季副业生产。
    各地都划分战线，加强了领导，提出了“保证卫星田和基本田吃饱喝足”的响亮口号。据科右前旗、布特哈旗等五个旗县的统计，投入水利建设的人数达五万五千多人。其中科右前旗由去年12月中旬的九千人，激增到二万二千人。全盟开口井达二千九百多眼，开渠一百一十二处，修建小水库七十六处，并且积极准备实现河网化和园田化。到去年12月底，海拉尔市郊区和各个旗县已举办了八个园田化训练班，训练人数约一千人。各地还派出旗县负责人、公社社长、党委书记等二百五十人，到河北、河南、安徽等地学习园田化和河网化的经验；最近从呼和浩特郊区请来的二十个老农，已到各个农业旗县开始传授园田化经验。
    积肥、熏肥、造肥运动，正在全盟普遍展开，到去年年底统计，已积肥七百七十亿斤，占今年总需要量的53.47％。突泉县和布特哈旗已建立五百九十三个土化肥厂，科右前旗造出土化肥五百万斤。
    各旗县都对冬季副业生产做了安排，订出了增加收入的计划，组织了副业生产大队，有的地方已取得显著成绩。额尔古纳旗已打鱼二十二万斤，他们计划在完成水肥任务的同时，抽出25％的劳动力，大搞打鱼、打兽、运输木材、清理林场等副业生产，争取在一百天之内增加收入二百万元。科右前旗三千人的副业生产大军积极展开了活动，现在已收入八十万元，计划到1959年4月底，纯增副业收入五百万元。布特哈旗抽出30％的劳动力，有计划有组织地进行打野猪、编席、拉脚等多项副业生产，保证今冬明春农村平均每人增加十元的收入。
    全盟商业系统的一万多名职工，表示要做好土副产品收购和物资供应工作，以促进人民公社多种经营的更快发展。（附图片）
