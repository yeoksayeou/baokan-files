Fujian's First Steel Plant

    Fujian Province's first modern steel plant—the Sanming Steel Plant—is under construction with great intensity. The Sanming Steel Plant is located in Sanming County, which has convenient transportation and abundant iron and coal deposits. It is a medium-sized integrated iron and steel enterprise including production equipment for ironmaking, steelmaking, coking, and manufacturing refractory materials. After the completion of the first phase of the plant, it will be able to produce 200,000 tons of iron, 200,000 tons of steel, and 150,000 tons of various steel products annually.

    The Sanming Steel Plant started construction in June 1958. By using both indigenous and foreign methods and manufacturing its own bricks and equipment, the plant will greatly shorten the construction period.

    福建第一座钢铁厂
    福建省第一座现代化的钢铁厂——三明钢铁厂正在紧张施工中。三明钢铁厂建在交通便利、铁、煤矿藏丰富的三明县。它是一座包括炼铁、炼钢、炼焦和制造耐火材料等生产设备的中型钢铁联合企业。这个厂第一期工程完工后，每年能产生铁二十万吨、钢二十万吨、各种钢材十五万吨。
    三明钢铁厂是1958年6月动工兴建的，由于采用了土、洋法并举，自己烧砖、办器材厂，这座厂将大大缩短工期。
