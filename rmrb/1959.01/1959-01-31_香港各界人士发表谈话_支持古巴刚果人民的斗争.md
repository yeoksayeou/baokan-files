Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th - According to a report in Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po": Hong Kong compatriots are very concerned about the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism and for national independence, and express their firm support for their just struggles.

Chen Yaochai, President of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, said that the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle for national independence is completely just. We firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban workers and all the people. U.S. imperialism must immediately withdraw its claws of interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

Huang Zufen, Principal of Chung Wah Middle School, Huang Huan, Principal of Fukien Middle School, and Luo Guisheng, Principal of Nam Chung Middle School, pointed out that in today's world where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the tide of national independence movements is also rising higher. Imperialism can absolutely not stop this surging tide. We, the Chinese people, along with the people of the world, regard the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people as our own struggles and give them our most resolute support.

Zhang Zihong, Director of the Hong Kong Office of the Commercial Press, and Wu Jinwen, Manager of the Chung Hwa Book Company, pointed out that we firmly believe that the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people will surely be victorious. Imperialists are paper tigers. As long as people awaken and dare to fight them, they will surely be exposed.

Well-known figures from Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles and cultural circles, including Gao Zhuoxiong, Zhu Shilin, Liu Fang, Ma Jian, Chen Junbao, Wang Kuancheng, and Tang Bingda, also pointed out: The days of imperialist hegemony are gone forever, and the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people are supported by the people of the world.
