    Making MSG from Fish Bones and Fish Organs
    The fresh fish production in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, exceeds one million dan annually, of which more than 800,000 dan are processed into various salted and braised fish products. The fish heads, fins, tails, bones, and internal organs removed during processing amount to about 200,000 dan. Recently, the commercial department of Yuanjiang County and local food processing plants cooperated to use these waste products to process 4,000 jin of fish meal. This fish meal can be used for animal feed for chickens, ducks, etc., or for pharmaceutical factories to cultivate bacterial fertilizer. They also plan to extract MSG from some of the fish meal. In this way, the county can produce more than 48,000 dan of fish meal and MSG annually.

    鱼刺鱼脏做味精
    湖南省沅江县的鲜鱼产品每年都在一百万担以上，其中有八十多万担加工成各种咸鱼、卤鱼。加工时被剔除的鱼头、鱼翅、鱼尾、鱼骨和鱼内脏等约有二十多万担。最近，沅江县商业部门和当地食品加工厂合作，利用这些废品加工出四千斤鱼粉，这些鱼粉可供鸡、鸭等动物饲料用，或供药厂培植细菌肥料用。他们还准备拿出一部分鱼粉提炼味精。这样全县每年就可生产四万八千多担鱼粉和味精。
