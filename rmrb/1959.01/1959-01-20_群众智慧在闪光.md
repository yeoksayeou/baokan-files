    The Wisdom of the Masses is Shining

    Yifeng County, Jiangxi Province, has used dozens of new manure collecting tools, greatly improving work efficiency, reducing labor intensity, and saving labor. This is a clever way to accumulate manure. This once again shows that it is not enough to rely solely on hard work and practical work; we must also work cleverly. Clever work depends on the masses. The wisdom of the masses is shining in all work, and we must be good at grasping it.

    群众智慧在闪光
    江西宜丰县运用了几十种新的积肥工具，大大提高了工效，减轻了劳动强度，节省了劳动力，这是积肥工作中的巧干。这再一次说明光靠苦干、实干不够，还一定要巧干。巧干要靠群众，群众的智慧在任何工作中都在闪闪发光，我们要善于抓住它。
