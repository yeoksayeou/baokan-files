    Understanding Objective Laws, Boosting Revolutionary Drive
    By Ai Siqi
    We are materialists, and we must adhere to the most fundamental principle of materialist epistemology: the primacy of the objective and the secondary nature of the subjective. In all our work and actions, we must, through investigation and research into our surrounding circumstances, ensure that our thinking conforms to the laws of objective things and that the tasks, guidelines, plans, and methods we stipulate have a realistic and reliable basis in the surrounding things.
    However, we are also dialectical materialists, revolutionary and militant materialists. Our understanding of the objective laws of things is not for passively and mechanically acknowledging their inevitability, nor is it to express submission before their inevitability with an attitude of idol worship. For us, the main task is to use the knowledge of the inevitable laws of objective things to change nature, transform society, build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and improve the material and cultural welfare of the people as quickly as possible.
    In terms of sequence, we must first have the objective, then the subjective; first matter, then consciousness. In terms of purpose, our main purpose is to give the fullest possible play to the subjective initiative of the people in using objective laws to transform the world. We do not seek knowledge for knowledge's sake; the mere recognition of objective laws is not our purpose. We recognize objective laws only to serve the purpose of transforming the world. This is the unity of opposites between objective laws and subjective initiative.
    Last year, the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China decided on the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." Comrade Mao Zedong called on the people of the whole country at the meeting to emancipate their minds, break down superstitions, and establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. These resolutions and calls have played an immense role in encouraging and promoting the purpose of giving play to the subjective initiative of the Chinese people in transforming the world. In the past year, a revolutionary mass movement to build socialism has been launched across all aspects of life and work throughout the country, creating a great leap forward in all areas of our work and enabling our people to achieve great successes in industrial and agricultural production, as well as in cultural and educational undertakings. These achievements vividly demonstrate the correctness of the Party's general line for socialist construction and Comrade Mao Zedong's call, proving the great significance of the subjective initiative of the people under the Party's general line and the Party's call.
    In order to implement the Party's general line and Comrade Mao Zedong's call to promote the leap forward in all aspects of work, we have constantly struggled against right-leaning conservative ideas over the past year. The characteristic of the ideological method of right-leaning conservatism is to view the objective laws of things and the role of material conditions with a metaphysical, mechanical, and even almost fatalistic viewpoint, treating certain general rules of things as immutable. People have rightly pointed out that the root of this ideological error lies in "seeing things but not people" and "conditionalism." It one-sidedly and inappropriately exaggerates the role of objective matter, as if people can only slavishly obey the objective laws of things, obey ready-made material conditions, and obey the common rules of things. In this kind of thinking, the subjective initiative of people's consciousness—understanding and utilizing the objective laws of things, creating necessary conditions, breaking common rules, and changing the world to seek their own welfare—cannot find a place. According to this erroneous view, all people's actions can only take the form of snail-like crawling, not revolutionary leap forward; all work can only be based on the principle of less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and not hope for more, faster, better, and more economical results. Obviously, if we do not criticize this right-leaning conservative ideology and overcome the influence of this erroneous thinking among the people, it will be impossible to mobilize the people, give full play to their consciousness and initiative, and promote the leap forward in all aspects of work throughout the country. In this sense, it can also be said that the achievements of the Chinese people over the past year represent the victory of Marxism-Leninism over right-leaning conservatism, the victory of the revolutionary method of more, faster, better, and more economical results over the crawling thought of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results, and the victory of dialectical materialism over metaphysics and mechanism.
    Speaking of giving play to people's subjective initiative and criticizing the erroneous views of "seeing things but not people" and "conditionalism," this by no means implies that people's actions can arbitrarily violate the laws of objective things or disregard the constraints of any material conditions. No! What we want to criticize is only the mechanical and metaphysical understanding of objective laws and material conditions in these erroneous views, not to deny the necessity of recognizing objective laws and mastering material conditions. It should be affirmed that the recognition of objective laws is the basis of people's subjective initiative. The more correctly and profoundly we understand the objective laws of things, the more capable we are of creating the necessary material conditions for promoting various tasks, and the more likely we are to give full play to people's subjective initiative. Therefore, opposing "seeing things but not people" does not mean that we can allow "seeing people but not things." Many major achievements and unprecedented inventions and creations in the national work over the past year are miracles that have never appeared in our country's history, but these miracles are not things that appear out of thin air, but the inevitable logical result of the people's correct grasp of the laws of objective things. The experimental fields with wheat yields of several thousand catties per mu are the result of fully and meticulously cultivating and working in strict accordance with the "Eight-Character Charter"; doubling the annual output of steel is the result of applying the dialectical laws of walking on two legs with both "large modern groups" and "small indigenous groups" in actual work; the emergence of the new system of people's communes is the inevitable result of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural productivity in the process of the Great Leap Forward. Tianjin workers invented the method of using converters to smelt silicon steel, breaking the convention of using electric furnaces to smelt silicon steel. Some engineers refused to believe it, saying that there was no scientific basis. However, the facts proved that it was precisely the heads of some people who were blindly memorizing books and sticking to conventions that lacked a scientific basis. Because the task of true science is not to ask people to always recite some ready-made book knowledge and stick to various outdated rules, but to require people to constantly study new knowledge of the laws of objective things through practice and apply this knowledge to continuously improve production and improve work. Those who dare to create, their achievements are due to groping for new objective laws knowledge and creating new favorable conditions for work. Their subjective initiative is built on a solid objective material basis, and therefore also has a full scientific basis.
    To say it again, opposing right-leaning conservatism, adhering to the policy of "going all out and striving for the top," adhering to emancipating the mind, breaking down superstitions, and daring to break the rules when necessary does not mean that there is no need to recognize objective laws or to attach importance to the role of material conditions. The question is how to treat objective laws and how to treat material conditions. Right-leaning opportunists, metaphysicians, and mechanists look at objective laws with a passive and static attitude, exaggerate the difficulties of material conditions, use various empty talks about conventions to bind people's minds, restrict people's actions, prevent people from moving forward, and find excuses for their own retreat. Militant and revolutionary dialectical materialists emphasize that we must be good at utilizing objective laws and constantly study new knowledge of laws, treat them as weapons of struggle, use them to create various necessary conditions, in order to continuously improve production, promote work, transform the world, and improve the welfare of the people.
    Combining the correct understanding of objective laws with the high degree of play of the subjective initiative of the people is a basic principle that runs through the Party's general line for socialist construction. When Comrade Mao Zedong called on us at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to establish a style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, he pointed out that our style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do must be based on Marxism—dialectical materialism. One of the reasons why we were able to achieve many major achievements in all aspects of work in 1958 was that the Party adhered to this principle of dialectical materialism in its leadership of national work, giving full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring energy of the broad masses of people, and correctly combining this subjective initiative of the masses with the recognition of objective laws.
    We emphasize the correct combination of the above two aspects, which means that neither aspect can be neglected. Since the recognition of objective laws and certain material conditions are the basis of people's subjective initiative, we must never leave the former and simply emphasize the latter in doing any work; without the former, the latter has no basis, and people's efforts will inevitably fail. Therefore, it is pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes": "Our leading cadres at all levels must be good at distinguishing between the true appearance and the false appearance of things, distinguishing between reasonable demands and unreasonable demands, and the judgment of the situation must strive to be close to objective reality. Only in this way can we formulate and implement our plans on a truly reliable basis." But it should also be understood that the Party Central Committee's instruction that we strive to make our judgment of things close to reality does not mean restricting the play of people's subjective initiative, weakening the people's soaring energy, and making us hesitate to advance in the face of battle; but precisely to guide the people of the whole country to realize the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" more powerfully, precisely to make us more powerfully bring the people's soaring energy into play on the firm basis of seeking truth from facts. Our demand for a correct understanding of objective laws and material conditions does not mean reducing the courage to emancipate the mind, break down superstitions, and dare to break the rules when necessary, but on the contrary, it is precisely to require our thinking to always maintain scientific correctness, so that we can be more confident in studying new truths, have a more adequate basis for breaking all kinds of superstitions, have more confidence in breaking the rules that should be broken, and have more courage to carry out new inventions and creations and complete more arduous tasks.
    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward to us more ambitious leap forward targets for 1959. We should further go all out and strive for the top. At the same time, we should further pay attention to recognizing the objective laws of things, so as to be better at leading the people to give play to their subjective initiative in transforming the world in all work, and fully realize these huge planned targets, so as to leap forward more vigorously towards the goal of a new China with modernized industry, modernized agriculture, and modern science and culture!

    认识客观规律　鼓足革命干劲
    艾思奇
    我们是唯物论者，必须坚持客观第一性，主观第二性这一个唯物认识论的最根本的原则，在我们的一切工作和行动中，必须通过对周围情况的调查研究，使我们的思想能够符合于客观事物的规律性，使我们所规定的任务、方针、计划、办法能够在周围事物中找到现实可靠的根据。
    但是，我们又是辩证唯物论者，是革命的、战斗的唯物论者，我们认识事物的客观规律，并不是为了消极地、机械地承认它的必然性，并不是要用偶像崇拜的态度，在它的必然性面前表示屈服。对于我们，主要的任务是在于利用客观事物的必然规律性的知识，来改变自然，改造社会，来多快好省地建设社会主义，来尽可能迅速地提高人民的物质和文化福利。
    论先后，一定要先客观，后主观，先物质，后意识。论目的，我们的主要目的就是要尽可能高度地发挥人民群众利用客观规律来改造世界的主观能动性。我们不是要为认识而认识，认识客观规律这事的本身并不是我们的目的，我们所以要认识客观规律，只是为要服从于改造世界的目的。这就是客观规律和主观能动性的对立的统一。
    去年，中国共产党的八大二次会议决定了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，毛泽东同志在会上号召全国人民解放思想，破除迷信，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义作风。这些决议和号召，对于发挥中国人民群众改造世界的主观能动性这个目的，起了巨大无比的鼓舞和推动作用。一年中间，在全国各方面的生活和工作中，掀起了空前未有的建设社会主义的革命群众运动的高潮，使我国各方面的工作出现了大跃进的局面，使我国人民在工农业生产事业方面以及文化教育方面都获得了许多巨大的成就。这些成就用鲜明的事实证明了党的社会主义建设总路线和毛泽东同志的号召的正确性，证明人民群众在党的总路线和党的号召之下所发挥起来的主观能动作用具有如何重大的意义。
    为着贯彻党的总路线和毛泽东同志的号召，以推动各方面工作的跃进，去年一年间，我们曾不断地对右倾保守思想进行过斗争。右倾保守主义的思想方法的特点，就是用形而上学的，机械的，甚至于近似宿命论的观点来看待事物的客观规律，看待物质条件的作用，把某些事情的一般常规看做是不能改变的东西。人们很正确地指出这种思想错误的根源是在于“见物不见人”，“唯条件论”。它片面地不适当地夸大了客观物质的作用，以为人们似乎只能奴隶一般地服从于事物的客观规律，服从于现成的物质条件，服从于事情的普通常规。在这种思想里面，人们的意识的主观能动性——认识和利用事物的客观规律，创设必要的条件，打破普通常规，改变世界，来为自己谋福利的这个主观能动性，是找不到地位的。按照这种错误的观点，人们的一切行动就只能采取蜗牛式的爬行方式，而不能采取革命的跃进方式，一切工作都只能以少慢差费为原则，而不能希望多快好省。很明显，如果不批判这种右倾保守主义的思想方法，不克服这种错误思想在人民群众中的影响，要把人民群众动员起来，高度地发挥他们的自觉性、积极性，促成全国各方面工作的跃进，是不可能的。在这样的意义上，也可以说去年一年中国人民的成就，是表示马克思列宁主义对右倾保守主义的胜利，是多快好省的革命方法对少慢差费的爬行思想的胜利，是辩证唯物论对形而上学、机械论的胜利。
    说到发挥人的主观能动性，说到要批判“见物不见人”、“唯条件论”等等的错误观点，这决不等于说，人们的行动可以任意违背客观事物的规律，可以不顾任何物质条件的约束。不是的！我们所要批判的，只是这些错误观点对于客观规律和物质条件的机械的、形而上学的了解，而不是要否定认识客观规律和掌握物质条件的必要性。应该肯定，对于客观规律的认识，是人的主观能动性的基础。愈是正确地深刻地认识了事物的客观规律性，就愈善于为推进各种工作创设必要的物质条件，也就更有可能高度地发挥人的主观能动性。所以，反对“见物不见人”，并不等于可以容许“见人不见物”。一年来全国工作中的许多重大成就，许多破天荒的发明和创举，都是在我国历史上未曾出现过的奇迹，但这种奇迹，都不是凭空出现的东西，而是人民群众正确地掌握了客观事物规律性之后必然产生的逻辑结果。亩产几千斤的小麦试验田，是严格地遵照“八字宪法”进行了充分地精耕细作的结果；钢铁年产量翻一番，是在实际工作中应用了“大洋群”和“小土群”两条腿走路的辩证规律的结果；人民公社这一种崭新制度的出现，是大跃进过程中工农业生产力迅速发展的必然结果。天津工人发明了用转炉炼矽钢的方法，打破了电炉炼矽钢的常规，个别工程师不肯相信，说是没有科学的根据。然而事实证明缺乏科学根据的恰恰是某些人的死背书本、墨守成规的头脑。因为真正的科学的任务，并不是要人永远背诵一些现成的书本知识，死守着各种陈旧的规章，而是要求人们通过实践，不断地钻研客观事物的新的规律知识，并应用这些知识来不断地提高生产，改进工作。那些勇于创造的人们，他们的成就，就是由于摸索到了新的客观规律知识，为工作创造了新的有利条件。他们的主观能动性是建立在稳固的客观物质基础上的，因此也是有充分科学的根据的。
    再说一遍，反对右倾保守主义，坚持“鼓足干劲，力争上游”的方针，坚持解放思想，破除迷信，敢于在必要时打破常规的方针，并不等于不需要认识客观规律，不需要重视物质条件的作用。问题在于如何对待客观规律，如何对待物质条件。右倾机会主义者，形而上学、机械论者用消极静观的态度来看待客观规律，夸大物质条件的困难，用各种关于常规的清谈来束缚人的思想，限制人的行动，阻止人们的前进，并为他们自己的退缩不前寻找搪塞的借口。战斗的、革命的辩证唯物论者，则强调要善于利用客观规律，并且不断地钻研新的规律知识，把它们当作战斗武器，利用它们来创设各种必要条件，以利于不断地提高生产，推进工作，改造世界，提高人民的福利。
    把正确地认识客观规律和高度地发挥人民群众的主观能动性结合起来，这是贯串在党的社会主义建设总路线中的一个基本原则。毛泽东同志在党的八大二次会议上号召我们树立敢想敢说敢做的风格的时候，就曾经指出，我们的敢想、敢说、敢做的风格必须是建立在马克思主义——辩证唯物论的基础之上的。1958年各方面工作之所以能够获得许多重大的成就，其原因之一，不能不说就是由于党在全国工作的领导上坚持了这个辩证唯物论的原则，既充分地发挥了广大人民群众的革命热情和冲天干劲，又使群众的这种主观能动性同对于客观规律的认识正确地结合起来。
    我们强调把上述两方面正确地结合起来，这就是说，无论那一方面都是不可偏废的。既然客观规律的认识和一定的物质条件是人的主观能动性的基础，所以我们做任何工作，决不能离开前者，而单纯强调后者；离开了前者，后者就没有依据，而人的努力必然落空。因此，在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“我们的各级领导工作人员必须善于区别事物的真象和假象，区别有根据的要求和没有根据的要求，对于情况的判断必须力求接近客观实际。只有这样，我们才能在确实可靠的基础上制定和实现我们的计划”。但也应该理解到，党中央指示我们对事情的判断要力求接近实际，这丝毫也不意味着限制人的主观能动性的发挥，削弱人民的冲天干劲，使我们在战斗面前踌躇不进；而正是为着指导全国人民更强有力地来实现“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，正是要我们在实事求是的坚定基础上面把人民的冲天干劲更强有力地发挥出来。我们要求对于客观规律和物质条件有正确的认识，并不是说要减少解放思想、破除迷信，敢于在必要时打破常规的勇气，而恰恰相反，这正是要求我们的思想经常保持科学的正确性，便于更有把握地去钻研新的真理，更有充分的根据去破除各种迷信，更有信心地去打破应该打破的常规，更有勇气去进行新的发明创造完成更加艰巨的任务。
    党的八届六中全会向我们提出了1959年的更加宏伟的跃进指标。我们应当进一步鼓足干劲、力争上游。同时，更进一步地去注意认识事物的客观规律，以便在一切工作中更善于领导人民群众发挥他们改造世界的主观能动性，圆满地实现这些巨大的计划指标，从而更雄健地向着具有现代化工业、现代化农业和现代科学文化的新中国的目标跃进！
