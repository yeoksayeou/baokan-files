    Making Production Closer to Raw Materials and Markets; Achieving Rational Distribution of Light Industry
    People's Communes Run Light Industry with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results
    Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Ministry of Light Industry Hold On-Site Conference to Promote Gaotang Experience

    (Reported by this newspaper) In late October of last year, Gaotang County, Shandong, on the basis of already operating some township and commune industries, and in accordance with the principle of combining industry and agriculture, developed light industry rapidly and well in addition to developing heavy industry factories such as machinery. In just forty days, the county built and expanded 181 medium- and small-sized factories in eight people's communes, including machinery, wood processing, textile, papermaking, leather, glass, alcohol, oil pressing, sugar making, grain processing, and sewing factories. This is just the beginning; already more than 65% of the county's population is eating machine-made noodles and wearing machine-sewn clothes. In the future, when production is normal, the alcohol produced can meet the needs of all power raw materials; the cultural paper produced can provide each person with sixteen jin per year; and the self-spun and self-woven cloth can reach 240,000 bolts. After the production capacity of these factories is fully put into production, the proportion of the annual output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value will leap from the original 8.5% to 47%, and the ranks of workers will increase by 2.3 times.

    In the process of building factories this time, the county and commune party committee first secretaries and the brigade party secretaries personally took charge, earnestly implementing the principle of grasping agriculture with one hand and industry with the other. The specific methods were: on the basis of unifying ideological understanding, implement collective leadership of the party committee, division of responsibilities, consideration of both industry and agriculture, unified arrangement of labor force, and the adoption of a combination of fixed workers and temporary workers. During the busy agricultural season, some labor force was transferred to engage in factory construction, and as the factories were built, fixed workers were gradually increased as needed. In order to speed up industrial construction, several shock transports of bricks and materials were also organized during construction. In production, in addition to making every effort to rush-produce agricultural tools to support agricultural production, workers and peasants also supported each other. Some commune party committees also adopted the "four togethers" approach in leadership methods, that is, discussing, arranging, inspecting, and evaluating industry at the same time as discussing, arranging, inspecting, and evaluating agriculture, so that industrial and agricultural production were not delayed. At the beginning, a few cadres believed that industry and agriculture could not be carried out simultaneously, that running industry would affect agriculture, and that rural communes should mainly engage in agriculture, while industry could be done slowly. These one-sided views and confused thoughts were thus corrected.

    In this mass campaign to run commune industries, the county first started with "small indigenous groups" and, at the same time, did not abandon the establishment of some medium-sized factories as the backbone of the communes to the best of its ability; adopted some foreign methods and new technologies, and implemented a combination of semi-indigenous and semi-foreign methods to expand production capacity and improve production efficiency. When the alcohol factory was first built, some people thought that a large amount of metal materials would be needed, but the masses used wine jars, ceramic pipes, and small vats to build distillation towers, using very little tin, and the alcohol produced was all above 90 proof, with the highest reaching 96 proof. Some places also created advanced indigenous production methods of solid-state fermentation and single distillation to produce alcohol. In addition to using power to drive the paper machine, the rest of the paper mill used wood to make machines, stone rollers to beat the pulp, and simple and feasible methods such as indigenous cooking. When the textile factory was built, there was a lack of iron spindles, so the woodworking factory manufactured wooden spindles, and the quality of the cotton yarn and cotton cloth produced was very good. Some people also advocated developing labor-intensive and inefficient manual ram presses when building new oil mills, neglecting the adoption of new technologies. After discussing with the masses, they adopted human-powered screw presses and lever presses, which were not only efficient and high-yielding but also easier to operate, greatly saving labor. Due to the correct implementation of the "small indigenous groups" policy, this industrial construction had the characteristics of low investment, quick results, and simple technology and equipment, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses to build industry through self-reliance. They said with satisfaction: The "small indigenous groups" policy is a policy of "two quicks" and "two mores," that is, quick construction and quick results; more factories and more technicians.

    In terms of factory construction methods, the county also broke the old set of capital construction procedures and replaced it with simultaneous planning and construction, simultaneous installation, simultaneous production, simultaneous work, and simultaneous learning. There were cases of starting production in old houses before expanding new factories; installing machinery and equipment before building factory buildings; and simultaneous construction and installation, with work being done inside and outside at the same time, which greatly accelerated the construction progress. Some factories produced products before the sheds were even built.

    In order to correctly implement the "small indigenous groups" policy, party committees at all levels also criticized and educated various tendencies of being divorced from reality and the masses, such as being greedy for bigness, being greedy for newness, "condition-ism," and conservative ideas that the smaller and more indigenous the better.

    Fully mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses' self-reliance to vigorously run industry is an important guarantee for Gaotang's success in running commune industries. Their approach was to first focus on the center of "reasoning, detailed accounting, and talking about the future," and widely carry out publicity and education activities in various forms to make it known to every household and everyone, forming a strong atmosphere of running industry. In addition, they also adopted forms such as great contending, great blooming, and big-character posters to conduct three debates among the broad masses: "Why run industry," "What kind of industry to run," and "Who to rely on to run industry"; at the same time as the debates, they also combined the calculations of the processing accounts of agricultural products and the labor-saving accounts after running industry to let the masses recognize the benefits and practices of vigorously running industry. After the masses understood these principles, the task of building factories became the actual action of the broad masses. An old woman in her seventies in Leyuan Commune automatically gave her jars to the winery to make wine; many people heard that there was not enough wood to build houses, so they gave the beams and purlins they had prepared to build new houses to the factory; the papermill lacked blankets and copper mesh, and after the masses learned of their use, they used old blankets and copper sieve bottoms as substitutes; even some people heard that there was not enough iron to rebuild the paper-drying cylinder, so they donated the "treasure sword" weighing more than 100 jin that had been passed down for generations. In order to solve technical difficulties, the county party committee proposed to carry out a skill-comparison and talent-offering campaign of "everyone offering a plan, and everyone creating a skill." After this, the masses of Dongfeng Commune recommended more than 700 technical talents, and the whole county trained nearly 2,000 technical talents of various types through methods such as digging, bringing, sending, inviting, and holding Zhuge Liang meetings. Furthermore, many inventions and model figures emerged in the technical innovation movement. Through the combination of unified planning from top to bottom and mass discussion from bottom to top, the masses changed the original plan of building 111 factories in 45 days to building 145 factories in 40 days, and finally actually completed 181 factories. The battle cry of the broad masses in vigorously running industry was: "If there are no materials, find them ourselves; if there is no equipment, make it ourselves; if there is no technology, actively learn it; do not rely on the commune, do not rely on the county, and build the factory ourselves." After this round of running industry, the cadres unanimously realized: "Relying on the masses is an inexhaustible force, and being divorced from the masses makes it difficult to move even a step; the masses are not only versatile but also omnipotent."

    Gaotang County's experience of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to vigorously run industry has received great attention. The Liaocheng Prefectural Party Committee, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, and the Ministry of Light Industry have held on-site meetings there. After the representatives of the light industry departments and bureaus of provinces and cities across the country and the party committees of some counties and communes attending the meeting visited, discussed, and evaluated, everyone agreed that Gaotang's experience could be vigorously promoted in combination with the specific conditions of various places. At present, the Liaocheng Prefectural Party Committee has called on all counties and cities in the entire prefecture to carry out a "learn from Gaotang, catch up with Gaotang, and compare with Gaotang" movement, and a mass upsurge of running industry has risen. After the meeting, the Ministry of Light Industry also mobilized nearly 700 cadres and students to form more than a dozen working groups, and after learning from Gaotang County's experience in vigorously running industry, they went to various provinces in East China, South China, and Central China to continue to carry out pilot projects to help the development of commune industrialization movements in various places.

    使生产接近原料和市场　使轻工业得到合理分布
    人民公社办轻工业多快好省
    山东省委和轻工业部举行现场会议推广高唐经验
    本报讯　山东高唐县去年10月下旬，在已经办了一些乡社工业的基础上，根据工农业并举的方针，除了发展机械等重工业工厂外，轻工业办得又快又好。仅用四十天的时间，全县在八个人民公社共新建扩建了机械、木材加工、纺织、造纸、皮革、玻璃、酒精、榨油、制糖、粮食加工、缝纫等中、小型工厂一百八十一个。现在仅仅才开始，全县已经有65％以上的群众吃到了机器面，穿到了机器缝纫的衣服；将来生产正常以后，所生产的酒精可以满足全部动力原料的需要；所生产的文化用纸，每人每年可以得到十六斤；自纺自织的布可以达到二十四万匹。这批工厂的生产能力全部投入生产后，年产值在工农业总产值中所占比重，将由原来的8.5％跃升到47％，工人队伍壮大了二点三倍。
    高唐县在这次办厂过程中，县、公社的党委第一书记以及大队的党书记都曾亲自挂帅，认真实行一手抓农业，一手抓工业。具体做法是：在统一思想认识的基础上，实行党委集体领导，分工负责，工农兼顾，劳动力统一安排，采用固定工与临时工相结合，在农忙时抽调部分劳动力去搞工厂建筑，随着工厂建成，又按需要逐步增加固定工人等做法。为了加快工业建设进度，在建设中还组织过几次突击运砖运料。在生产上，除努力赶制农具，支援农业生产外，还实行工人农民相互支援。有些公社党委在领导方法上还采用了“四同”的做法，即是在讨论、布置、检查、评比农业的同时，也讨论、布置、检查、评比工业，做到了工农业生产两不耽误。少数干部在开始时，认为工农业不能并举，办工业会影响农业，农村公社主要搞农业，工业可以慢慢来等种种片面看法和混乱思想，因而得到了纠正。
    在这次大办公社工业中，这个县先从“小土群”做起，同时在力所能及的情况下，不放弃建立一些中型厂，作为公社的骨干；采用一些洋办法和新技术，实行半土半洋、土洋结合，以扩大生产能力，提高生产效率。开始兴建酒精厂时，曾有人认为非用大量金属材料不可，结果群众以酒坛、陶管、小缸等垒起来，建起了蒸馏塔，用锡很少，出的酒精都在九十度以上，最高能达到九十六度。有的地方还创造了用固体发酵，一次蒸馏出酒精的先进的土法生产。造纸厂除纸机采用动力带动外，其余部分就用木材制机器，石碾子打浆，土法蒸煮等简易可行的办法。建纺织厂缺乏铁纱锭，就由木器厂制造木纱锭，纺织出的棉纱棉布质量很好。也有人在新建榨油厂时，主张发展劳动强度大、效率低的人力撞榨，忽视新技术的采用。经过与群众研究商量，采用了人力螺旋榨、杠杆压榨等榨油机后，不但效率高，产量大，且操作比较简便，劳力大大节省了。由于正确的执行了“小土群”方针，使这次工业建设具有投资少，收效快，技术、设备简易等特点，大大促进了群众发挥自力更生办工业的积极性和主动创造精神。他们满意地说：“小土群”的方针是“两快”、“两多”的方针，即是指建厂快、收效快；建厂多、技术人员多。
    在建厂的方法上，这个县也打破了老一套的基建程序，而以边规划边施工、边安装、边生产、边干、边学来代替。出现了先就旧房生产，后扩建新厂；先安装机器设备，后盖厂房；以及边建厂边安装、里外一齐动手等做法，大大加快了建设进度。有的工厂棚子还没有盖起来，就生产出了产品。
    为了能正确地贯彻执行“小土群”的方针，各级党委还对贪大、贪新、“唯条件论者”和认为愈小愈好、愈土愈好的保守思想等各种脱离实际脱离群众的倾向，进行了批判和教育。
    充分发动群众，依靠群众的自力更生，轰轰烈烈办工业，这是高唐大办公社工业能够获得胜利的重要保证。他们的做法是首先围绕着“讲道理、算细账、话前景”这一中心，采用各种形式广泛地开展大办工业的宣传教育活动，使之家喻户晓，人人皆知，形成了一股强烈的办工业气氛。此外，还采取了大鸣、大放、大字报等形式在广大群众中进行了“为什么办工业”、“办什么样的工业”、“依靠谁来办工业”的三题辩论；与辩论的同时，又结合计算了农产品的加工账，办工业之后节约的劳力账，让群众认清大办工业的好处和做法。这些道理被群众认识之后，建厂任务便成为广大群众的实际行动。乐园公社有个七十多岁的老大娘自动的把坛子给酒厂酿酒；不少人听说盖房木料不足，就将自己准备盖新房的大梁、檩条送给工厂；造纸厂缺毛布、铜网，群众问明了用途后，就拿旧毛毯、铜罗底来代用；甚至有人听到翻造纸烘缸用铁不足，便将几代祖传的一百多斤重的“宝刀”也献出来了。为了解决技术困难，县委提出开展“人人献一计、个个创一手”的比巧献能运动之后，东风公社的群众一下就推荐出了技术人材七百多名，全县经采取挖、带、派、请、开诸葛亮会等办法，共培训了各种技术人材近二千名。并且在技术革新运动中涌现了不少创造发明和模范人物。通过自上而下统一规划和自下而上群众讨论相结合的形式，群众把原定四十五天建厂一百一十一个改成为四十天建厂一百四十五个，最后实际完成了一百八十一个。广大群众在大办工业中的战斗口号是：“没有物料自己找，没有设备自己造，没有技术积极学；不靠社、不靠县，来把工厂建。”经过这次办工业，干部也一致的体会到：“依靠群众力量无穷，脱离群众寸步难行；群众不仅是多面手，而且是万能手。”
    高唐县发动群众、依靠群众大办工业的经验，受到极大的重视。聊城地委、山东省委和轻工业部已在当地召开了现场会议，经过出席会议的全国各省市轻工业厅局和部分县委、公社党委代表的参观、讨论和评比，大家一致认为高唐的经验可以结合各地具体情况大力推广。目前，聊城地委已经号召全专区各县市开展了“学高唐、赶高唐、比高唐”的运动，群众办工业热潮已经起来。轻工业部在会议结束后，也调集了干部、学生近七百人，组成十多个工作组，在学习了高唐县大办工业的经验后，分赴华东、华南、华中各省继续进行试点，以帮助各地公社工业化运动的开展。（附图片）
