    Our Newspaper reports: The Gaochang Production Team canteen of the Hushu People's Commune in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, has meticulously calculated and rationally arranged its grain consumption plan from January to August based on busy and idle seasons and the intensity of agricultural work.
    The Gaochang canteen feeds 322 people, with an average annual ration of 600 jin per person. In addition to the grain already used, the canteen recently submitted its grain and vegetable consumption plan for January to August this year to the masses for discussion, before making comprehensive arrangements and establishing monthly and daily grain and vegetable consumption plans.
    Long-term plan: Based on the principle of using more grain during busy periods and less during idle periods, ensuring everyone is well-fed whether busy or idle, the period from January to August is divided into two stages. From January to March, when agricultural work is not busy, grain consumption is appropriately reduced; from April to August, when agricultural work is heavier, grain consumption is gradually increased.
    Short-term arrangement: A "ten-day menu" is arranged every ten days. Based on the intensity of work each day, the amount of grain used is appropriately increased or decreased within the grain consumption quantity arranged in the long-term plan.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the grain and vegetable consumption plan, the Gaochang canteen has established various measures and systems. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the canteen management committee, improving the financial system, and establishing various forms, it also stipulates that the administrator and the production team leader should contact each other once every evening to inquire about the amount of work for the next day. The cooks then decide on the amount of rice to cook and vegetables to prepare based on the principle of what work is being done and what food is being eaten.

    粮菜安排好　忙闲都吃饱
    高场食堂吃粮实行长计划短安排
    本报讯　江苏省江宁县湖熟人民公社高场生产队食堂，根据忙闲季节、农活轻重，精打细算，合理安排了1月至8月的用粮计划。
    高场食堂有三百二十二人吃饭，平均每人每年口粮六百斤。除已用粮外，最近这个食堂将今年1月至8月用粮吃菜计划，交给群众讨论后，做了全面安排，订出逐月逐日用粮吃菜计划。
    长计划：根据忙时多用粮，闲时少吃粮，忙时闲时都吃饱的原则，把1至8月划分两个阶段。1月至3月，农活不忙，适当减少用粮；4月至8月农活较重，用粮逐步增加。
    短安排：每十天安排一次“十日饭菜单”，根据每天做活轻重，在长计划安排的用粮数量上，适当增减。
    为了保证用粮吃菜计划的实现，高场食堂订出了各项措施和制度，除了加强食堂管理委员会的领导，健全财务制度，建立各种表册以外，还规定每天晚上由事务长和生产队长联系一次，问清次日工作量大小，炊事员根据作什么活、吃什么饭的原则，决定下米、做菜多少。
