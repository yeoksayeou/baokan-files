Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 19th: The "Neues Deutschland" newspaper published a portion of the report by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, under the title "Achieving National Rejuvenation of Germany Through a Peace Treaty."

Ulbricht said that at a time when the fact that West Germany has become a base for atomic and rocket weapons constantly threatens the German people, the German working class and the German people should bravely embark on a new path. This path is to refrain from war propaganda, to not prepare for war, to not implement revanchist policies, and to not seize other countries' territories. This is the path to unifying Germany into a great and powerful nation, free and independent in the fields of economy, science, and culture, on the basis of peace and democracy.

Ulbricht welcomed the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union, saying that it is in the national interest of the German people that the Soviet government suggests wiping the slate clean of the war fourteen years after the end of World War II and creating conditions so that Germany will not become a base for military provocations or a launcher of war for the third time.

Analyzing some of the clauses of the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, Ulbricht pointed out that the treaty would not have any impact on the existence and development of the socialist social system of the German Democratic Republic, nor would it have any impact on the existence of the capitalist society of West Germany. It is equally acceptable to socialists and capitalists. It contains only provisions concerning Germany's sovereignty as a peaceful and democratic state and its relations with other countries.

Speaking on the Berlin issue, Ulbricht recalled that the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in its broad plan for a peaceful resolution of the German question, suggested that the residents of Berlin work together to make Berlin a city of peace and put forward a plan to normalize the situation in Berlin.

Ulbricht then said that the Soviet government's proposal on the Berlin issue opens up good prospects for easing the tension in our city. In addition, an agreement on the demilitarization of West Berlin would be an important step in easing the tension in the whole of Germany and creating favorable prospects for the rapprochement of the two Germanies and negotiations on the reunification issue. We are prepared to reach a mutual understanding on the issue of the status of West Berlin as a free city, and of course, we will respect this status on our side.

Ulbricht emphasized that the Soviet Union is prepared to hand over the powers now exercised by the Soviet authorities in Berlin to the authorities of the German Democratic Republic, which all honest Germans can only welcome. He said that it is quite obvious that if the United States, Britain, and France respect the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic in the proper manner, then handing over the power to inspect the movements of the three countries' guard troops and goods to the authorities of the German Democratic Republic will not exacerbate the situation in the slightest.

Ulbricht refuted the Western proposal for "all-German free elections," emphasizing that such elections would be elections under the pressure of NATO atomic weapons and militarists. Ulbricht said that, in the final analysis, the ruling circles of Western countries should consider that the restoration of Germany's unity is entirely a matter for the German people themselves, and the unification of Germany cannot be allowed to be realized under the pressure of Western imperialist countries with the aim of dragging the whole of Germany into NATO.

Ulbricht then spoke about the tasks, organization, and purpose of a confederation of the two Germanies. He emphasized that the establishment of a confederation is linked to the main requirements for the implementation of a peace treaty. The conclusion of a peace treaty would create the necessary preconditions for the rapprochement of the two Germanies and their close cooperation. The ultimate goal of the confederation is to unify Germany into a peaceful and democratic state. Therefore, the confederation is temporary.

Speaking about the organization and activities of the future confederation, Ulbricht pointed out that the highest body of the confederation should be the All-German Conference (formerly translated as committee).

The All-German Conference of the Confederation elects an executive body - the Presidium of the Conference. The powers of the All-German Conference include the signing of a peace treaty and maintaining contact with the other signatory countries of the peace treaty on all matters relating to the implementation of the peace treaty. The All-German Conference can also deal with issues such as concluding agreements with foreign countries on foreign trade, navigation, participation in international markets, participation in international organizations, and international conventions.

The All-German Conference of the Confederation will work to adjust relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. This refers primarily to issues such as the abolition of conscription in the Federal Republic of Germany, the determination of the size of the armed forces, the adjustment of internal trade within Germany, and so on.

The All-German Conference of the Confederation has no right to issue orders to the parliaments and governments of the two Germanies; it can only make suggestions to them. The two Germanies each retain sovereign and equal status within the Confederation.

Preparing for all-German elections is also a task of the Confederation. Ulbricht emphasized that under the current circumstances, the establishment of a confederation by the two Germanies is the only realistic path to restoring German unity.

Ulbricht pointed out that in the presence of two Germanies, the establishment of normal diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with them by various countries will promote a peaceful resolution of the German question. The maintenance of unilateral diplomatic relations by Western countries with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is tantamount to encouraging the aggressive militarist forces in West Germany.

Ulbricht then spoke about the position taken by the Social Democratic Party on the extremely important issues facing the German people.

Ulbricht said that the mistake of the Social Democratic Party leadership is that it proceeds from the policies that Western countries have always implemented, rather than taking its own independent German position.

The attitude towards the Soviet Union's note on a peace treaty with Germany can prove which Social Democrats and trade union leaders support the cause of peace and the restoration of German unity, and which are following the policy of Adenauer's party, the Christian Democratic Union.

Ulbricht pointed out that the relationship between the working class of West Germany and the working class of the German Democratic Republic must be built on a foundation of trust. He emphasized that the time has come for the West German working class to take on the struggle for peace and against German militarism.

Ulbricht called on Social Democratic Party members to support the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty with Germany and to promote the unity of all forces to strive for the reunification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic state through the establishment of a confederation. He suggested a comprehensive discussion of the issue of guaranteeing peace in Germany, the issue of restricting atomic armaments and clerical militarist forces, and the issue of the working class and all peace forces striving to change West German policy.

He said that we are willing to provide every opportunity for this open and honest discussion. We are also willing to accept all suggestions made by the Executive Committee of the German Social Democratic Party and its organizations at all levels aimed at sincerely discussing the possibility of the German workers jointly implementing a policy of peace and consultation.

    成立邦联促进德国统一
    签订和约走向民族复兴
    乌布利希在德国统一社会党中央全会上报告
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社柏林18日讯：“新德意志报”以“通过和约达到德国民族复兴”为题刊登了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在统一社会党中央全会上报告的一部分。
    乌布利希说，当西德变为原子武器和火箭武器基地这件事实经常威胁着德国人民的关头，德国工人阶级和德国人民应当勇敢地走上新道路。这条道路就是不进行战争宣传，不准备战争，不实行复仇主义政策，不夺取别国领土，这就是在和平和民主的基础上把德国统一成一个在经济、科学和文化方面自由而独立的伟大的强国的道路。
    乌布利希欢迎苏联提出的对德和约草案，他说，苏联政府建议在第二次世界大战结束以后十四年的今天来一笔勾销战争，并且创造一种使德国不会第三次成为军事挑衅基地或者战争发起者的条件，这符合德国人民的民族利益。
    乌布利希在分析苏联的对德和约草案的某些条款时指出：和约对于德意志民主共和国社会主义社会制度的存在和发展不会有任何改变，它对于西德资本主义社会的存在也不会有任何改变。它对社会主义者和资本主义者都是同样可以接受的。和约中包含的全是关于德国作为一个和平民主国家的主权和它同其他国家的关系的条款。
    在谈到柏林问题时，乌布利希追述说，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会在和平解决德国问题的广泛计划中建议柏林居民共同努力使柏林成为和平的城市，并且提出了使柏林局势正常化的计划。
    乌布利希接着说，苏联政府关于柏林问题的建议为缓和我们城市的紧张局势开辟了良好的前景，此外，关于西柏林非军事化的协议会成为缓和整个德国的紧张局势的重要步骤，并且为两个德国的接近和谈判恢复统一问题创造了有利的前景，我们准备在西柏林作为自由城市的地位的问题上取得相互谅解，当然我们这方面将尊重这个地位。
    乌布利希强调指出，苏联准备把苏联当局现在还对柏林执行的职权交给德意志民主共和国当局，一切诚实的德国人对此只能欢迎。他说，十分明显，如果美国、英国和法国的人士将以应有的方式尊重德意志民主共和国的主权，那末把检查三国警卫部队和商品的调动情况的职权交给德意志民主共和国当局就丝毫也不会使局势尖锐化。
    乌布利希驳斥了西方所提出的“全德自由选举”的主张，他强调说，这种选举将是在北大西洋公约组织原子武器和军国主义者的压力下的选举。乌布利希说，归根到底，西方国家的统治集团应当考虑，恢复德国的统一完全是德国人民自己的事情，不能容许在西方帝国主义国家的压力之下，抱着把整个德国都拖入北大西洋公约组织的目的来实现德国的统一。
    乌布利希接着谈到了有关两个德国邦联的任务、组织和目的的问题。他强调说，建立邦联是同执行和约的主要要求相联系的。缔结和约就会给两个德国的接近和它们的密切合作创造必要的前提。邦联的最终目的是把德国统一成一个和平民主的国家。因此邦联是暂时性的。
    在谈到未来邦联的组织和活动时，乌布利希指出，邦联的最高机构应当是全德会议（前译委员会）。
    邦联全德会议选举执行机构——会议主席团。全德会议职权包括签订和约，在有关履行和约的一切问题上同和约的其他签字国保持联系。全德会议还能处理这样一些问题：同外国签订关于对外贸易、通航、参加国际市场、参加国际组织和国际公约的协定。
    邦联全德会议将从事调整德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间关系的工作。这首先是指这样的一些问题，如取消德意志联邦共和国的兵役制，确定武装部队人数，调整德国内部贸易等等。
    邦联全德会议无权向两个德国的议会和政府发布命令，它只能向它们提出建议。两个德国在邦联内各自保有主权和平等地位。
    筹备全德选举也属于邦联的任务。乌布利希强调指出，在目前情况下，两个德国成立邦联是恢复德国统一的唯一现实的道路。
    乌布利希指出，在存在着两个德国的情况下，各国同它们建立正常的外交、经济和文化关系会促进德国问题的和平解决。西方国家同德意志联邦共和国政府保持单方面的外交关系，这等于是怂恿西德侵略性的军国主义势力。
    乌布利希接着谈到社会民主党在德国人民极其重大的问题上所采取的立场。
    乌布利希说，社会民主党领导的错误在于，它是从西方国家过去一直实行的政策出发的，而不是采取自己独立的德国人的立场。
    对待苏联关于对德和约的照会的态度，就可以证明哪些社会民主党人和工会领导人赞成和平事业和恢复德国统一，哪些是跟着阿登纳的党——基督教民主联盟的政策走。
    乌布利希指出，西德工人阶级和德意志民主共和国的工人阶级之间的关系必须建立在信任的基础上。他强调指出，西德工人阶级承担起争取和平和反对德国军国主义斗争的时候已经到来了。
    乌布利希号召社会民主党党员支持苏联关于对德和约的建议，促进一切力量团结起来争取通过建立邦联的办法使德国重新统一为一个和平民主的国家。他建议全面讨论保证德国和平的问题，约束原子武装和教权派军国主义势力的问题，工人阶级和一切和平力量争取转变西德政策的问题。
    他说，我们愿意给这种开诚布公的讨论提供一切机会。我们也愿意接受德国社会民主党执行委员会及其各级组织旨在真诚讨论德国工人共同实行和平和协商政策的可能性而提出的一切建议。
