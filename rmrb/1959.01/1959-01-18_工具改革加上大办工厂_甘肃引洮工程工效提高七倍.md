Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 17th: The Yintao Up-the-Mountain Water Conservancy Project, currently being undertaken by the people of Gansu, has seen an increase in average work efficiency of more than sevenfold in the six months since its commencement, due to the vigorous promotion of tool reform and the large-scale construction of factories. As of December 15th last year, the Yintao project had completed over 190 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, accounting for 24.3% of the total earth and stone work of the first phase of the project, which is over 780 million cubic meters.

In the past few months, the 150,000 workers on the Yintao construction site, under the leadership of the Engineering Bureau, have vigorously promoted tool reform and large-scale factory construction, enabling the construction site to achieve mechanization and earthwork automation, greatly improving work efficiency. The average work efficiency has increased from 4.37 cubic meters at the beginning of the project to 33 cubic meters, an increase of more than sixfold.

In the past few months, the Yintao Engineering Bureau, under the premise of putting politics in command and giving priority to ideology, has tightly grasped several key aspects and carried out a series of in-depth and meticulous work:

    1. Fully mobilize the masses, closely integrate with construction needs, and based on terrain and soil and rock characteristics, everyone contributed ideas and suggestions, setting off a movement for tool reform and invention. The thirteen work areas along the entire line created a total of 250 kinds of tools, more than 100,000 pieces. For example, in digging, the three-tooth hoe and three-edged steel drill bit created have improved efficiency by three to four times compared to foreign hoes and ordinary steel drill bits. For transporting soil, high-level line transportation, rope-pulled land boats, and automatic dumping trucks are used, all of which can automatically load and unload, with work efficiency thousands of times higher than wheelbarrows. In deep excavation and soil extraction, devices such as rope traction, pulleys, flywheels, and windlasses are used, and work efficiency has also been greatly improved. Other tools such as ramming, stone transportation, and sand washing have also been greatly reformed, realizing "fast digging, loading, transporting, and unloading" and soil automation and ball bearing application.

    2. Resolutely implement the principle of "people-run with government assistance," mobilize the masses, break through the five major barriers of ideology, technology, raw materials, equipment, and funds, adopt small-scale, indigenous, and mass methods, making do with whatever is available, using local materials, and processing them locally, and build factories on a large scale, realizing the factoryization of water conservancy construction sites. The entire construction site has built a total of 637 factories of nineteen types, including tool manufacturing plants, cement plants, and lime plants, distributed in various work areas, large teams, and platoons. These factories have produced more than 140,000 tools and a large amount of low-grade cement, stone, sand, etc., which have been supplied in a timely manner to meet construction needs.

    3. Continuously improve labor organization and operating methods. In the construction process, each work area has explored a set of experiences in rationally organizing the labor force, implementing the "three fixed" of "personnel, location, and tools" and the specialized division of labor of "digging, loading, blasting, and transporting." And according to the improvement of tools, constantly adjust the labor organization, basically eliminating the phenomenon of idling and waste. There have also been great improvements in operating methods. The Longxi work area has promoted the streamlined impact method, increasing work efficiency by dozens of times; the Jingyuan work area and the Huining work area have also created and promoted many advanced experiences, which have played a significant role in improving work efficiency.

### 工具改革加上大办工厂  甘肃引洮工程工效提高七倍

    工具改革加上大办工厂
    甘肃引洮工程工效提高七倍
    新华社兰州17日电　甘肃人民正在进行的引洮上山水利工程，开工半年来由于大闹工具改革、大办工厂，使平均工效提高了七倍多。截至去年12月15日，引洮工程已完成土石方一亿九千多万方，占第一期工程土石方总量七亿八千多万方的24.3％。
    几个月来，引洮工地上的十五万民工在工程局领导下，大闹工具改革和大办工厂，使工地实现了机械化和土自动化，大大提高了工效。由刚开工时平均工效四点三七方提高到三十三方，提高了六倍多。
    几个月来，引洮工程局在政治挂帅、思想先行的前提下，紧紧抓住了几个主要环节，进行了一系列深入细致的工作：
    一、充分发动群众紧密结合施工需要，根据地形及土石质特点，人人献计献策，掀起工具改革与发明创造运动。全线十三个工区共创造了各种工具二百五十种，十万多件。如在挖凿方面，创造的三齿镐、三刃钢钎头，就比洋镐和普通钢钎提高效率三、四倍。运土采取高平线运输，绳索牵引旱船、自动倒土车等，都可以自动装卸，工效比独轮车提高千倍以上。在深挖取土方面，运用了绳索牵引、滑轮、飞轮、辘辘等装置，工效也大有提高，其他如打夯、运石、洗砂等工具都有很大改革，实现了“挖、装、运、卸”四快和土自动化与滚珠轴承化。
    二、坚定不移地贯彻了“民办公助”的方针，发动群众，突破了思想、技术、原料、设备、资金五大关，采取小、土、群的办法，因陋就简，就地取材，就地加工，大办工厂，实现了水利工地工厂化。整个工地共办起工具制造厂、水泥厂、石灰厂等十九种工厂六百三十七个，分布在各工区、各大队、中队，这些工厂已生产出十四万多件工具和大量的低标号水泥、石料、砂子等，及时供应了施工需要。
    三、不断地改进劳动组织和操作方法。在施工过程中，各工区都摸索出一套合理组织劳动力的经验，实行了“人员、地点、工具”三固定和“挖、装、爆、运”专业分工的办法。并且根据工具的改进，不断调整劳动组织，基本上消灭了窝工浪费现象。在操作方法上也有很大改进。陇西工区推广了流水冲击法，提高工效数十倍；靖远工区和会宁工区也都创造和推广了许多先进经验，对提高工效起了显著作用。
