    How to Calculate Labor Accounts?
    To launch winter production, we must calculate labor accounts; to arrange annual production, we must also calculate labor accounts... Because all production is done by people, without people, there is no strength, and it is naturally difficult to complete the production plan.
    However, there are many subtleties in calculating accounts, and each has its own method. To summarize, they can be broadly divided into two types: one is calculating fixed accounts, and the other is calculating flexible accounts. Adding together the absolute numbers of full and half labor forces is calculating fixed accounts. According to this method, in the face of very heavy production tasks, the more you calculate, the more insufficient the labor force seems, the greater the difficulties, the more problems arise, and the smaller the enthusiasm. What is calculating flexible accounts? It means not only counting the numbers of the labor force, but also fully estimating the dynamic role of people. Calculated in this way, the more you calculate, the more methods you find, the greater the confidence, and the more sufficient the enthusiasm.
    The news about the Hunan commune launching winter production published in this newspaper today is a very good example. The commune's production tasks were not reduced, and the manpower was not increased, but the time to complete the task was two months earlier than when the labor accounts were calculated. What is the reason for this? Because they vigorously carried out tool reforms and improved labor organization—in a word, they fully utilized the dynamic role of people.

    怎样算劳力账？
    开展冬季生产要算劳力账，安排全年生产也要算劳力账，……因为一切生产都是要人来做的，没有人，也就没有力量，自然难以完成生产计划。
    但是，算账可大有讲究，各有各的算法。概括起来说，可以大分为两种：一种是算死账，一种是算活账。把整半劳动力的绝对数字加在一起的算法，就是算死账。按照这个算法，在十分繁重的生产任务面前，越算劳力越不够，困难越大，问题越多，干劲越小。什么是算活账呢？那就是不仅要统计劳动力的数字，而且要充分估计人的能动作用。这样算，越算办法越多，信心越大，干劲越足。
    今天本报发表的湖南公社开展冬季生产的消息，就是一个很好的典型。这个社的生产任务没有缩减，人力没有增加，但完成任务的时间却比算劳力账时提前两个月。这是什么道理呢？因为他们大搞工具改革，改善了劳动组织——一句话，充分发挥了人的能动作用。
