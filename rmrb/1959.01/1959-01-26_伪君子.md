    Hypocrite
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Ying Tao
    U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell admitted that U.S. aid is unpopular, and in the minds of the people in the "aided" countries, "the United States seems like a hypocrite."
    To perform a play, first draw the mask,
    To deceive people, first put up a facade,
    Disguised as a philanthropist;
    He has ideas to help when there are difficulties.
    He sends knives to suppress revolution,
    He sends spies to carry out subversion.
    U.S. aid is like a chain,
    To trap people's necks.
    American goods fill the stalls,
    Forcing people to close their shops,
    Scraping away gold and silver,
    Leaving thousands and millions to starve.
    Everyone holds up a demon-revealing mirror,
    Seeing through the American devils,
    Exposing their true colors,
    Turns out to be a hypocrite.
    Breaking free from the chains and standing upright,
    Shouting slogans and raising clubs,
    Digging out this bad root,
    Only then can we have peaceful days.
    Secretary is scared out of his wits,
    Admitting that the U.S. imperialism is a liar,
    Burning his head and unable to find a way out,
    Anxious and running around in circles! (Attached picture)

    伪君子
    天马诗　英韬画
    美国劳工部长密契尔承认美援不得人心，在被“援助”国家人民的心目中，“美国好像是伪君子”。
    要唱戏先勾脸子，
    要骗人先装幌子，
    打扮成慈善家样子；
    有困难他给想法子。
    镇压革命他送刀子，
    进行颠复他派探子。
    美援好像一根链子，
    套住人家的颈子。
    美国货摆满摊子，
    逼得人关了铺子，
    刮去了金子银子，
    千人万人饿肚子。
    大家手拿照妖镜子，
    看透了美国鬼子，
    揭穿他的老底子，
    原来是个伪君子。
    挣断锁链站直身子，
    高呼口号举起棍子，
    挖掉这个坏根子，
    才能过太平日子。
    部长大人吓破胆子，
    供认美帝是个骗子，
    焦头烂额没法子，
    急得团团转圈子！（附图片）
