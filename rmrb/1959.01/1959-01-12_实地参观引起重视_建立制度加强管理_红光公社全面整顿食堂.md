　　Our newspaper reports that the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, is comprehensively rectifying canteen work and vigorously saving grain by further organizing the masses' lives.

　　First, through some typical materials, cadres were made aware that organizing commune members' lives should be comprehensive, not only to ensure that commune members are full and eat well, but also to save. Moreover, only by paying attention to saving can we guarantee that commune members are full and eat well in the long term. Each cultivation area, with the canteen as the center, widely launched a great debate on saving grain, praising good people and good deeds in saving grain. Some canteens also held small exhibitions, which were very effective. For example, after a meal, the Fourth Canteen of the First Cultivation Area organized everyone to visit the site, and collected the rice scattered on the table on the spot, enough for five adults to eat a meal. This aroused everyone's attention. The next day, this canteen saved more than twenty catties of rice.

　　In addition to strengthening ideological education for commune members, the commune has also established some necessary systems. All public canteens have established unified grain consumption standards. Monthly grain consumption must be allocated through the commune and cannot be taken from the granary at will. In terms of canteen management, a canteen accounting system has been established, so that each canteen can consume within the food expenditure standards stipulated by the commune, achieve planned consumption, and regularly publish accounts of canteen grain consumption and cash expenditure. For the feed grain of livestock and poultry, we also try our best to use coarse grains and substitutes. In terms of cooking techniques, canteens exchanged experiences in saving grain, achieving a combination of coarse and fine grains, dry and thin, and diversified food, so that commune members can eat both full and well, economically and evenly. Some canteens have also established canteen covenants, such as registering visitors and takeaways in advance. In addition, the commune also conducted a general inspection of more than 1,200 granaries scattered in various teams, established a grain storage system, and regularly turned and dried them, ensuring that each granary has a dedicated person in charge.

    实地参观引起重视　建立制度加强管理
    红光公社全面整顿食堂
    本报讯　四川省郫县红光人民公社从进一步组织群众生活着手，全面整顿食堂工作，大力节约用粮。
    首先，通过一些典型材料，使干部认识到组织社员生活要全面，不仅要使社员吃饱、吃好，还要节省。而且只有注意节省，才能保证社员长期吃饱、吃好。各耕作区以食堂为中心，广泛展开节约粮食的大鸣大放大辩论，表扬节约粮食的好人好事，有些食堂还举办了小型展览会，收效很大。如一耕作区第四食堂在一次饭后，组织大家就地参观，当场把饭桌上抛撒的米饭收集起来，足够五个大人吃一顿。这一下引起了大家的重视。第二天，这个食堂就节余了二十多斤大米。
    公社除了加强对社员的思想教育外，还建立了一些必要的制度。各公共食堂建立了统一的用粮标准，每月用粮要通过公社拨领，不能任意到粮库拿用。在食堂管理方面，建立了食堂会计核算制，使各食堂在公社规定的伙食开支标准以内，作到有计划的消费，定期公布食堂粮食耗用、现金开支的账目。对于牲畜、家禽的饲料粮也尽量注意用粗粮和代用品。在炊事技术上，各食堂相互交流了节约粮食的经验，作到粗细粮搭配，有干有稀，饭菜多样化，使社员吃得又饱又好又省又匀和。有些食堂还建立了食堂公约，来客、带饭都要事先登记等制度。此外，公社还对分散在各队的一千二百多个粮仓，普遍作了检查，建立了粮食保管制度，定期翻晒，作到每座粮仓都有专人负责。
