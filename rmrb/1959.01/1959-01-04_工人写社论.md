    Workers Write Editorials
    Qin Li
    On December 12th of last year, the Workers' Daily published an editorial entitled "Learn Philosophy, Use Philosophy, Talk Philosophy." This was written collectively by comrades Chen Yougui, Zhen Lianyu, Dong Guisen, and Zhang Zhihui from Tangshan, at the special invitation of the editorial department.
    This editorial has clear viewpoints, lively content, is both substantial and realistic, and explains the principles of workers studying philosophy, greatly using philosophy, and greatly talking about philosophy in a clear and understandable way.
    Workers discussing philosophy is now a common sight. In the words of the workers themselves, this is called "philosophy returning home." Because proletarian philosophy is originally a summary of the experiences of the working class in production struggles and class struggles, workers consciously studying and applying it can be said to be handling it with ease. However, the newspaper editorial department taking the initiative to invite workers to write commentary is a new initiative of newspapers relying on the worker-peasant masses, worthy of a place in the history of Chinese newspapers and periodicals. Workers starting to write editorials for their own newspapers is truly a case of putting the pen in the right hands, and is indeed a cause for celebration.
    Some people think that newspaper editorials are always "discussed" by people "in" the newspaper "office." In fact, this "office" includes all the people. The working class and all working people are truly the masters of public opinion, and the editorial department itself is also a member of it.

    工人写社论
    秦犁
    去年12月12日，工人日报发表了一篇社论：“学哲学，用哲学，讲哲学”。这是编辑部特请唐山工人陈有贵、甄连玉、董贵森、张智慧等同志集体写作的。
    这篇社论观点明确，内容生动，有虚有实，深入浅出，把工人大学哲学、大用哲学、大讲哲学的道理讲得一清二楚。
    工人谈论哲学，现在已经常见了，用工人自己的话说，这叫做：“哲学还家”。因为无产阶级的哲学，原本就是工人阶级生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验总结，工人自觉地学习它、运用它，可以说是驾轻就熟。但是报纸编辑部主动地请工人写评论，却是报纸依靠工农群众的新创举，值得在我国报刊史上写上一笔；工人开始动手为自己的报纸写社论，这又是笔得其主，实在是件可喜可贺的事情。
    有人以为，报纸社论，总是报“社”里的人“论”出来的。其实，这“社”是包括了全体人民在内的，工人阶级和一切劳动人民，真正是社会舆论的主人，而他自己也正是其中一员。
