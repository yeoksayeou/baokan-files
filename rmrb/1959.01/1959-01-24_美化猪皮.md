    Beautifying Pigskin
    Speaking of pig leather, people generally think that it has large pores, a rough surface, and many wrinkles. In particular, some pigskin shoes, once they get wet, become swollen and out of shape, leaving people with the impression that they are neither beautiful nor durable.
    In fact, it is a complete misunderstanding to say that pigskin is not good-looking. According to the practice of using pigskin for leather making in recent years, although pigskin was originally very unsightly, as long as methods of beautifying pigskin are adopted during leather making, it is entirely possible to tan leather as good as cowhide, sheepskin, and other leathers.
    There are several methods for beautifying pigskin:
    One is to trim the grain surface. This kind of pigskin is exactly the same as cowhide, with a smooth and delicate grain surface and patterns that other leathers do not have. A pigskin can also be split into two layers with a splitting machine, and the second layer can also be made into a pig grain leather as smooth as the first layer by trimming the grain surface.
    Another method is to make pigskin into suede, that is, flipped leather. Generally, women like to wear suede leather shoes, and men wear deerskin clothes. In the past, they were all made of sheepskin, but now some of them are made of pigskin. Some leather factories also make pigskin into leather with interwoven patterns of both smooth and suede surfaces.
    The third is to change the tanning method. Pig sole leather tanned with a variety of domestic plant tanning agents, chrome-vegetable combination tanning, or aluminum-chrome-vegetable combination tanning has good elasticity, is durable, and has low water absorption. If another tanning method is used, the pig sole leather can be made completely waterproof.
    Pigskin is not only a good leather raw material in China, but it is also very popular abroad. In some countries, a pair of pigskin shoes is much more expensive than cowhide shoes. Now, general leather factories use more delicate raw skins to make grain leather, clothing leather, gloves, etc. Because its pores are relatively small and it has natural patterns, it can be made into various beautiful products. In addition, pigskin is easy to dye. Dyeing it into lighter brown, beige, white, red, and other colors, and making it into leather bags and various leather shoes and gloves, makes it look even more beautiful.

### 美化猪皮

    美化猪皮
    提起猪皮革，一般总认为它毛孔粗大、表面不光滑、绉纹多，特别是有些猪皮鞋稍一沾水，就会变得胖头胖脑，不成样子，给人们留下一个既不美观、又不耐用的印象。
    其实，说猪皮不好看，完全是一种误解。根据这几年用猪皮制革的实践证明，尽管猪皮原来很难看，但在制革时只要采用美化猪皮的方法，完全可以鞣制出像牛皮、羊皮以及其他皮革一样好的皮革来。
    猪皮的美化方法有下面几种：
    一种是修整粒面。这种猪皮和牛皮完全一样，粒面光滑细致，并具有其他皮革所没有的花纹。一张猪皮还可以用片皮机片下二层皮，二层皮也可以用修整粒面的方法制成和头层皮一样光滑的猪面革。
    还有一种是把猪皮制成绒面革，也就是翻皮。一般女同志喜欢穿的绒面皮鞋、男同志穿的鹿皮衣服，过去都是用羊皮做的，现在，有一部分已经用猪皮做了。有的制革厂还把猪皮制成既有光面，又有绒面交织花纹的皮革。
    第三种是改变鞣制方法，用多品种国产植物鞣料、铬植结合鞣或铝铬植结合鞣等方法鞣制的猪底革，这种鞋底弹性好、耐用，吸水性小。如果使用另一种鞣制方法，还可以使猪底革完全防水。
    猪皮不但在国内是一种很好的皮革原料，就是在国外，也很受欢迎，有些国家，一双猪皮革做的鞋要比牛皮鞋贵得多。现在一般皮革厂都把比较细致的原料皮做面革、衣服革、手套革等等。由于它的毛孔比较细小，又具有天然的花纹，可以制成各种美观的产品。加上猪皮容易染色，把它染成较浅的棕、米黄、白、红等等颜色，制成皮包和各种皮鞋、手套，显得更加美观。
