**Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the USSR for 1959-1965**

**Summary of Comrade Khrushchev's Report to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union**

	MOSCOW, January 27 (Tass) - Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, today reported to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held in the Kremlin, that the Congress will discuss a program for further construction of communism, aiming to achieve new heights in the economy, culture, and material well-being of the working people.

	When Khrushchev appeared on the platform, he was greeted with thunderous applause from the delegates and foreign guests.

	Khrushchev said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU is convened to discuss the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965. He said that this is a great program. Its scale is unprecedented in history.

	The socialist countries are leading all progressive humanity

	The environment of the USSR has never been as stable as it is now

	The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee said that three years have passed since the 20th Congress. Over these three years, the USSR has continued with confidence to advance along Lenin's path to communism, further strengthening its might and enhancing its international prestige in the struggle for peace and the friendship of peoples.

	Khrushchev went on to say that the socialist world is now more united, consolidated, and unbreakable than ever before. It has a decisive influence on the entire process of human development. The reporter said that it can be confidently stated that the socialist countries are leading all progressive humanity.

	Khrushchev informed the Congress delegates that representatives from 70 countries' communist and workers' parties are attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

	Khrushchev, on behalf of the Congress delegates, the entire Party, and all the people of the USSR, extended heartfelt greetings to the leaders of the fraternal parties.

	In speaking of the achievements of the Soviet people, who have undergone the most profound transformation, Khrushchev pointed out the leading role of the Party and its Central Committee, headed by Joseph Stalin for many years. The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee said that our country, once backward, has become a powerful industrial-collective farm socialist state. Now, the industrial output of the USSR ranks first in Europe and second in the world.

	Khrushchev pointed out that bourgeois economists and politicians have not once predicted that the USSR, due to the restoration of the national economy after World War II, would have to slow down its economic development. However, such predictions have burst like soap bubbles. The economy of the USSR continues to develop rapidly.

	Khrushchev went on to say that the reorganization of the management of industry and construction is a very important factor in accelerating the development of the national economy. In the short period of work of the Councils of the National Economy, the new forms of managing industry have shown great advantages, the leadership of production has become more concrete. The growth rate of industrial products has increased, the work of tapping internal production potential and utilizing national natural resources has improved, and the initiative and activity of workers and engineering and technical personnel have increased.

	In speaking of the great efforts made by the Party, the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia to further develop the national agriculture, Khrushchev said that over the past five years, compared to the previous five years, the average annual grain production has increased by 39%. Khrushchev said, comrades, this is a great victory.

	Khrushchev went on to say that on the basis of the universal upsurge of the socialist economy and the increase in labor productivity, the material well-being of the Soviet people is constantly growing. In 1958, the actual income of workers and employees was nearly double that of 1940, and the actual income of peasants, calculated per working peasant, increased by more than one and a half times.

	The reporter pointed out that the culture of the various nationalities and ethnic groups of the USSR has reached an unprecedented flourishing. Currently, the number of specialists with higher and secondary education in the national economy is approximately 7.5 million, which is 38 times more than in 1913. The number of university students in Soviet higher educational institutions is approximately three times more than the total of Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy combined. The number of engineers trained by Soviet higher educational institutions is almost twice as many as those trained by American higher educational institutions.

	Khrushchev specially pointed out in his report the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists, designers, engineers, and workers, who have created a new feat of world significance - the successful launch of a multi-stage interplanetary rocket towards the Moon.

	Khrushchev emphasized that the successful launch of the world's first artificial Earth satellite is an outstanding achievement of Soviet scientists and the entire people, a vivid sign of the high level of technical development of Soviet industry. The whole world welcomes this victory, regarding it as the beginning of a new era in the history of mankind's conquest of nature - the era of the conquest of space.

	The words of the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee that the world's first artificial Earth satellite is a Soviet satellite, and the first artificial planet in the solar system is a Soviet planet, were greeted with stormy applause from the delegates.

	Khrushchev said that the USSR, a multi-national state of working people, an alliance of socialist nationalities, is becoming stronger every year. In recent years, the powers of the union republics have greatly expanded, which indicates further development of Soviet democracy and enables each republic to develop its economy and culture more rapidly.

	Khrushchev said that the domestic and international environment of the USSR has never been as stable as it is now. The USSR, the invincible socialist camp, possesses all the necessary conditions to stop the forces of aggression; they are a strong bastion of the peace and security of the peoples.

	The USSR enters a new period of comprehensive construction of communism

	The main task is to create the material and technical foundation of communism

	In outlining the main tasks of the 1959-1965 seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR, Khrushchev said that the great achievements of the Soviet people and the great changes they have achieved in all aspects of economic and socio-political life enable the USSR to enter a new and very important period of development - the period of comprehensive construction of communism.

	Khrushchev briefly described the main task of this period - the creation of the material and technical foundation of communism, the further strengthening of the economic and defensive might of the USSR, and the increasingly full satisfaction of the constantly growing material and spiritual needs of the people. The reporter said that in essence, it is a matter of completing a historical task - to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of the per capita production of goods.

	Khrushchev pointed out that the fundamental issue for the next seven years is to gain as much time as possible in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism. He then proposed specific tasks in the economic, political, ideological, and international spheres.

	In the economic sphere, the task is to develop production comprehensively, on the basis of priority development of heavy industry, to achieve such growth in the production of all economic sectors that it will take a decisive step in creating the material and technical foundation of communism and ensuring victory in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries. The strengthening of the state's economic power, the further technical development of all sectors of the national economy, and the continuous increase in social labor productivity will ensure a significant improvement in the living standards of the people.

	In the political sphere, the task is to further consolidate the socialist system of the USSR, to further strengthen the unity of the Soviet people, to develop Soviet democracy, to mobilize the initiative and creativity of the broad masses of the people in the construction of a communist society, to expand the functions of social organizations in solving state problems, to enhance the organizational and educational role of the Party and the socialist state, and to consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants and the friendship of the peoples of the USSR.

	In the ideological sphere, the task is to strengthen the ideological and educational work of the Party, to raise the communist consciousness of the working people, especially the younger generation, to educate them in the communist attitude towards labor, in Soviet patriotism and internationalism, to overcome the capitalist remnants in people's consciousness, and to struggle against bourgeois ideology.

	In the sphere of international relations, the task is to consistently implement a foreign policy based on the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence of states with different social systems, to maintain and strengthen peace and the security of the peoples. It is necessary to strive to stop the "cold war" and ease international tensions. Every effort should be made to strengthen the world socialist system and the family of fraternal peoples.

	Khrushchev mentioned in his report some figures to show that the outline of his report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965 has undergone extensive discussion. More than 70 million people across the country participated in the discussion. In various meetings, 4,672,000 people expressed various opinions, additions, and suggestions. In addition, journals, radio, and television received more than 650,000 letters and articles containing various suggestions and opinions.

	Khrushchev spoke about some of these suggestions.

	On this point, Khrushchev said that the working people, in their speeches, all expressed their determination to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the seven-year plan.

	Industrial and transportation output to increase by 80% over seven years

	Equivalent to the increase over the past twenty years

	In discussing the issue of developing industry and transportation, Khrushchev pointed out that the control figures stipulate high-speed development of the production of all industrial sectors, especially heavy industry, and a significant increase in their absolute output.

	He said that the planned total industrial output for 1965 is to be approximately 80% higher than in 1958, with the first category - the production of means of production - increasing by 85-88%, and the second category - the production of means of consumption - increasing by 62-65%. The reporter emphasized that this is a very large increase. The increase in industrial output over the seven-year plan period will be equivalent to the increase over the past twenty years.

	Khrushchev continued to say that it is planned to produce 6,500 to 7,000 million tons of pig iron in 1965, 8,600 to 9,100 million tons of steel, and 6,500 to 7,000 million tons of steel products. The production of non-ferrous and rare metals will increase several times. The investment in the construction and reconstruction of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises is planned to be more than the investment over the past thirty years. Among them, 67% of the investment in the ferrous metallurgical industry and about 60% of the investment in the non-ferrous metallurgical industry will be used to expand and reconstruct existing enterprises, which should produce more than three-quarters of the planned increase in iron, steel, and steel products. The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee said that this use of funds is the most advantageous.

	Khrushchev went on to say that the plan is to rapidly develop the chemical industry. Over seven years, the total production of chemical products will increase by nearly two times. The production of mineral fertilizers in 1965 is to reach 3,500 million tons, while in 1958 it was 1,200 million tons, which is extremely necessary for effectively solving the most important task - increasing the yield per unit area of various crops.

	Khrushchev went on to say that in the fuel industry, a firm policy is being pursued to prioritize the development of oil and gas extraction and processing. In 1965, the extraction of oil will reach 230 to 240 million tons, which is more than double. The extraction and production of gas will increase by about four times, reaching 1,500 billion cubic meters per year. At the same time, the share of oil and gas in the total fuel production will increase from 31% to 51%, while the share of coal will decrease from 60% to 43%. The reporter said that adopting such a policy in the development of the fuel industry has great economic benefits.

	Khrushchev then pointed out that by the end of the seven-year plan, the electricity generation will reach 500 to 520 billion kilowatt-hours, and the designed capacity of power stations will increase by more than one and a half times. To save time and to make the most effective use of basic construction investments in the seven-year plan, it is stipulated to prioritize the construction of thermal power stations using natural gas, heavy oil, and cheap coal.

	In addition to the commissioning of thermal power stations, it is also stipulated to build the following hydroelectric power stations: the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Power Station, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Power Station, the Votkinsk Hydroelectric Power Station, and other hydroelectric power stations. There will also be a series of nuclear power stations with various types of reactors put into operation.

	The reporter pointed out that the seven-year plan stipulates the accelerated development of all modern machine-building sectors, primarily heavy machine-building, instrument-making, automation equipment, and electronic equipment production. Special emphasis is placed on creating and producing the latest machines utilizing achievements and inventions in the field of science and technology, especially radio electronics, semiconductors, ultrasound, and radioactive isotopes.

	Khrushchev emphasized that due to the high level of development of heavy industry and the implementation of measures to increase agriculture, it will be possible to significantly increase the production of food and industrial goods. Over seven years, the total value of light industry products will increase by approximately 50%, and the total value of food industry products will increase by 70%.

	Khrushchev said that by 1965, the volume of freight turnover on railways will increase by 39% to 43% compared to 1958. It is planned to fundamentally modernize several major types of transportation, especially railways, by replacing steam locomotives with economically viable electric and diesel locomotives. By the end of the seven-year period, electric and diesel locomotives will be used on all major railway lines with a total length of about 100,000 kilometers.

	The seven-year plan proposes the task of mechanizing the entire production process in industry, agriculture, construction, transportation, loading and unloading work, and public utilities, and on this basis, eliminating heavy manual labor.

	At the same time, it is necessary to more widely implement the automation of production, fundamentally improve working conditions, and sharply increase labor productivity.

	Agricultural production to increase by 70% over seven years

	It will be fully able to meet the needs for food and raw materials

	In his report, Khrushchev outlined the main tasks in agriculture as follows: to strive to achieve a level of production that can fully meet the needs of the population for food, the needs of industry for raw materials, and to ensure all other needs of the state for agricultural products.

	Over the period of 1959-1965, it is planned to increase the total agricultural production by 70%. The production will increase by an average of 8% per year. In this regard, Khrushchev said that it should be noted that the average annual growth rate of American agriculture over the past seven years has been less than 2%.

	Khrushchev emphasized that the main direction of agriculture in the coming years will remain the effort to increase the production of grain, which is the basis of the entire agriculture. One of the main tasks of agriculture is to increase labor productivity and reduce the cost of products. Khrushchev continued to say that over seven years, it is necessary to provide agriculture with more than 100,000 tractors and about 40,000 grain harvesters.

	In the coming seven years, the main task in livestock farming will be to increase the production of meat, milk, wool, and eggs. The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out that our country ranks first in the world in the total production of milk and animal fats. In the coming years, we will not only catch up with but also significantly surpass the United States in the per capita production of these two products.

	In discussing the issue of basic construction and the distribution of productive forces, Khrushchev pointed out that over the next seven years, the total investment of the state will reach approximately 2 trillion rubles. If the construction projects carried out with decentralized funds, the investments of collective farms, and the construction of residential buildings with the funds of residents are added, then the total investment will reach 3 trillion rubles. Khrushchev emphasized that this means that the investment over seven years is approximately equal to the total investment over the entire period of Soviet power.

	Khrushchev went on to say that the basic investment in industry will be approximately double that of the past seven years. The total investment of the state and collective farms in agriculture will reach approximately 500 billion rubles, which is almost double the total investment over the past seven years.

	The plan stipulates the implementation of measures to fundamentally reconstruct enterprises, expand and technically re-equip enterprises, and update and modernize equipment, which in many cases will make it possible to solve the task of increasing production more quickly and with much less financial and material resources than building new enterprises.

	A large amount of funds has been allocated for the construction of housing and cultural life. In the construction of housing and public buildings, the state will spend 375 to 380 billion rubles over seven years, while the expenditure over the past seven years was 208 billion rubles.

	Khrushchev pointed out that in the next seven years, the USSR will pay special attention to the use of natural resources in the eastern regions, planning to allocate more than 40% of the investment there. Khrushchev said that by 1965, the share of the eastern regions in coal mining will increase to 50%, in steel production to 48%, in refined copper to 88%, in aluminum to 71%, in cement to 42%, and in electricity generation to 46%.

	Khrushchev pointed out that the establishment of new grain bases in the eastern regions of the state will enable us to fundamentally reorganize the agricultural production of a series of republics and regions and to more rationally use the rich natural economic conditions to expand the production of agricultural and livestock products. For example, in the past, we had to purchase grain from all over the country, but now it is possible to no longer purchase grain from many regions in the northwestern part of the Russian Federation, the Baltic republics, Belarus, and the low-lying areas of Ukraine. These regions will specialize in the production of dairy products, salted meat, and industrial raw materials, for which they have the best conditions.

	Khrushchev went on to say that our plan clearly reflects Lenin's national policy, which guarantees broad possibilities for the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all peoples. This is once again confirmed in the control figures for the development of the national economy for 1959-1965, which emphasize the need to significantly increase the economy of all Soviet republics.

	Khrushchev then pointed out that it is possible to implement the plans for the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation over the next seven years, and to complete the construction plans for the next seven years, under the conditions of significantly improving the technical level and increasing labor productivity. Khrushchev pointed out that over seven years, the labor productivity per worker in industry should increase by 45% to 50%, in construction by 60% to 65%, in state farms by 60% to 65%, and in collective farms by approximately one and a half times. The reporter emphasized that by 1965, due to the increase in labor productivity, the increase in industrial products will account for three-quarters of the total increase.

	Continuously improving the living standards of the working people

	National income will increase by 62% to 65%

	Khrushchev emphasized that the seven-year plan sets the task of ensuring the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people on the basis of further significant development of all economic sectors and the priority development of heavy industry.

	The seven-year plan stipulates:

	- Significantly increasing national income and, on this basis, significantly increasing the actual income of the working people;
	- Shortening the working day and reducing the number of working days per week;
	- Increasing the production of consumer goods and improving their quality;
	- Large-scale construction of housing;
	- Significantly improving the public, cultural, and living facilities for residents.

	Khrushchev pointed out that the national income of the USSR is the most comprehensive indicator and actual basis for the improvement of the material well-being of the working people under the socialist system. By 1965, the national income of the USSR will increase by 62% to 65% compared to 1958, which is almost five times higher than the pre-war level of 1940. By the end of the seven-year plan, the actual income of workers, calculated per worker, will increase by 40%. The actual income of collective farmers will increase by at least 40%.

	The seven-year plan stipulates an increase in wages. Khrushchev said that the Party and the government will consistently implement the established policy of increasing wages and lowering prices.

	The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee said that this is only one of the ways to improve the material well-being of the people.

	Khrushchev went on to say that in order to meet the personal needs of each person, it is necessary not only to increase wages but also to increase social funds, the role and significance of which will continue to grow.

	Khrushchev then pointed out that after the completion of the seven-year plan, the accumulation of socialist enterprises will continue to grow and will ultimately become the sole source of ensuring the expanded reproduction of socialism and the further improvement of the living standards of the people. Khrushchev pointed out that the proportion of taxes paid by Soviet residents is now negligible, totaling only 7.8% of budget revenues. The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee emphasized that all this enables us to stop taxing residents in the coming years.

	Khrushchev also pointed out that the problem of employment of residents, which capitalism cannot solve, the constant unemployment in cities, and the bankruptcy of a large number of farms do not exist in socialist society. He said that over seven years, the number of workers in the USSR will increase by approximately 12 million, reaching a total of 66.5 million.

	Khrushchev pointed out in his report that the funds allocated by the state for the public welfare of the working people are constantly increasing. In 1958, the expenditures for social insurance, subsidies, pensions, scholarships, free education, medical facilities, vacation expenses, boarding schools, kindergartens, rest homes, nursing homes, and other various expenditures and benefits totaled more than 215 billion rubles. According to the seven-year plan, the expenditures for these purposes in 1965 will reach approximately 360 billion rubles. Khrushchev said that only a socialist state can allocate so much money to improve the lives of its people.

	The reporter went on to say that over seven years, it is planned to build a total of 650 to 660 million square meters of housing, which is approximately 15 million apartments. Khrushchev pointed out that this is more than the total area of urban housing built since the establishment of Soviet power. The task in the distribution of housing area is to transition to each family having a separate apartment.

	Khrushchev went on to say that the Communist Party has always considered the struggle to shorten the working day to be one of its programmatic tasks. The control figures stipulate that in the transition to shortening the working day and the working week, not only will wages not be reduced, but they will be significantly increased. The USSR will achieve the shortest working day and the shortest working week in the world while improving the welfare of the residents.

	Strengthening ideological work and developing new qualities in people

	Schools closely linked to life to cultivate more talents

	The First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out that in order to transition to communism, not only a powerful material and technical foundation is needed, but also a high level of consciousness of the entire society. The higher the consciousness of millions of people, the more effectively the plans for the construction of communism will be implemented. He emphasized that all the ideological work of our Party and state is to develop new qualities in Soviet people, to educate them in the spirit of collectivism and love for labor, in the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, in the spirit of high principles of the new social morality, and in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

	Khrushchev said that the communist outlook and standards of conduct are established in the struggle against capitalist remnants. One cannot calmly wait for these capitalist remnants to disappear on their own; one must fight them decisively.

	In the entire educational work, the Party considers the growth of the younger generation to be of particular importance. Young people are now building communism and will live and work in a communist society in the future, managing all public affairs. Soviet youth should be prepared to undertake this noble mission.

	Khrushchev went on to say that schools play a special role in the communist education of the growing generation. We are reorganizing schools not because we lack labor, but because we want to further improve national education and make schools more closely linked to life. Khrushchev emphasized that the combination of learning and productive labor is not a devaluation but rather a strengthening of the role of acquired knowledge.

	The reporter pointed out that we must increase the role of the state and society in the education of children. For this purpose, it is necessary to widely develop the construction of boarding schools, kindergartens, and nurseries. By 1965, the number of students in boarding schools will be no less than 2.5 million. The number of children in kindergartens will increase from 2.28 million to 4.2 million over seven years.

	Khrushchev went on to say that over the period of 1959 to 1965, higher educational institutions will train 2.3 million specialists, while the number trained over the previous seven years was 1.7 million. The total number of specialists with higher education in 1965 will be more than 4.5 million, which is a 50% increase compared to 1958.

	In discussing the scientific work plan of Soviet researchers, Khrushchev said that scientists will first focus on mastering controlled thermonuclear reactions to obtain practically inexhaustible sources of energy. It is planned to ensure the wide use of atomic energy in power and transportation engines, to expand the use of synthetic materials, nuclear fission products, and radioactive isotopes in the national economy, to solve the problem of the comprehensive mechanization and automation of the production process, and to create new technical means on this basis, widely using the achievements of physics, radio electronics, and computing technology.

	Khrushchev said that the construction of communism requires not only unprecedented development in the economy, science, and culture but also opens up unprecedentedly broad prospects for the full and comprehensive development of all creative abilities and talents of people. Literary, theatrical, film, musical, sculptural, and painting workers have the mission to further raise the artistic level of their creations.

	The seven-year plan stipulates the creation of more favorable conditions for ideological work - publishing, broadcasting, television, film, and cultural and educational institutions will be widely developed, the circulation of newspapers, magazines, and books will significantly increase, and special attention will be paid to radio broadcasting and the construction of cultural and educational institutions, especially in rural areas.

	The next seven years are a crucial stage in the economic competition

	Decisive changes favorable to socialism will occur

	Khrushchev said that the seven-year plan is a crucial stage in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism, and this plan will have a profound impact on the entire international situation, marking a new victory for Marxism-Leninism. He said that our achievements in completing the plan will attract millions of believers to the side of socialism, inevitably strengthening the forces of peace and weakening the forces of war. He said that decisive changes favorable to socialism will occur in the economic sphere of the international arena.

	Khrushchev went on to say that due to the completion of the seven-year plan, we will take a decisive step in achieving the basic economic task of the USSR - catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production in the shortest historical period.

	The reporter pointed out that in 1958, the industrial output of the USSR was significantly higher than the combined industrial output of France, Britain, and West Germany. Now we are entering a new stage of economic competition with capitalism. Now the task is to strive for the socialist system to dominate world production, surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of social labor productivity and per capita production, and ensure that the people have the highest living standards in the world. In this stage of competition, the USSR must surpass the United States economically.

	In comparing the economies of the USSR and the United States, Khrushchev pointed out that the total industrial output of the USSR is approximately half that of the United States, while the total agricultural output of the USSR is 20% to 25% lower than that of the United States. In terms of per capita industrial product output, the United States exceeds the USSR by more than one and a half times, and in terms of agricultural products, the United States is approximately 40% higher than the USSR.

	Khrushchev went on to say that undoubtedly, the seven-year plan stipulates an average annual increase of 8.6% in industrial output, which not only can be ensured but also can be exceeded. It is expected that in the near future, the annual increase in industrial output in the United States will be approximately 2%.

	Khrushchev emphasized that in the past eight years, the USSR has surpassed the United States in the absolute increase of a series of the most important products (steel, pig iron, iron ore, oil, coal, cement, wool textiles). Therefore, the USSR has surpassed the United States in the speed of increase and the absolute annual increase. According to the speed of industrial growth in the USSR and the United States, when the plan is completed, the absolute output of some of the most important products of the USSR will exceed the current industrial production level of the United States, and some products will approach the current level of the United States.

	Khrushchev said that by 1965, the total output and per capita output of the most important agricultural products of the USSR will exceed the current level of the United States. To catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita industrial output, it may be necessary to wait until after the completion of the seven-year plan, perhaps another five years. At that time, or possibly earlier, the USSR will rank first in the world in terms of the absolute output and per capita output of industrial products. Khrushchev emphasized that this will be a victory of world historical significance for socialism in the peaceful competition with capitalism on the international stage.

	Khrushchev pointed out that high speed is now a universal law of socialism, confirmed by the experience of the countries of the socialist camp. He cited figures and facts to illustrate the development of industrial production in the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Khrushchev pointed out that in 1958, the industrial production of socialist countries was four times higher than in 1937. Some people's democratic countries have entered the period of completing socialist construction. Like the USSR, they are approaching the period of building a communist society.

Title: Khrushchev Speaks at the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 27th

Khrushchev continued, stating that the world socialist system, as a whole, has caught up with the world capitalist system in terms of industrial output per capita. According to economists, after the completion and overfulfillment of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for national economic development and due to the rapid economic development of the people's democratic countries, the output of the countries in the world socialist system will account for more than half of the world's total industrial output.

The socialist camp countries have all the necessary prerequisites to take the lead in world production. The advantage in the rate of production development is on the side of the world socialist system.

In the past five years (1954-1958), the average annual growth rate of industrial production in the entire socialist camp was 11%, while in the entire capitalist world it was less than 3%. International division of labor, especially this division of labor in its advanced form—specialization and cooperation—will play a significant role in the economic development of the socialist camp. No single country could have such a rapid development rate as the socialist national system.

When discussing the international response to the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1959-1965 released by the Soviet Union, Khrushchev pointed out that the seven-year plan is now the focus of world public opinion.

Friends enthusiastically welcome the Soviet plan for communist construction. In the enemy camp, the control figures have caused their panic and disarray. The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out that we have every right to say that the seven-year plan has already achieved its first victory because it has won universal international recognition.

Khrushchev pointed out that some people in the West say that we have issued a "challenge." However, this is a challenge in the peaceful development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards. What we hope for is not a competition in the expansion of armaments and the manufacture of atomic, hydrogen bombs, and rockets, but a competition in the production of industrial goods, meat, oil, dairy products, clothing, footwear, and other consumer goods.

The seven-year plan will play a huge role in maintaining peace. The power of the socialist camp may eliminate war. Khrushchev then discussed international issues. He emphasized that the seven-year plan once again reflects the Leninist peace policy of the Soviet Union. He said that the implementation of the seven-year plan will play a huge role in solving the fundamental problem of the contemporary world—maintaining world peace.

Khrushchev continued, saying that the seven-year plan is significant because it is filled with a spirit of love for peace. A country that is engaged in the grand construction of new factories, power stations, mines, and other enterprises, that allocates nearly 400 billion rubles for housing construction and public utilities construction, and that is committed to significantly improving the living standards of the people, its goal is certainly peace, not war.

Khrushchev said that, secondly, the completion of the seven-year plan will strengthen the economic power of the Soviet Union to such an extent that the strengthening of the economic power of the Soviet Union plus the strengthening of the economic power of the socialist countries will ensure that the balance of power on the international stage is in a decisive advantage favorable to peace, thus creating new and more favorable conditions for preventing a world war and maintaining world peace.

Khrushchev said that the conclusion of the 20th Party Congress that war is not an inevitable fate has been proven to be completely correct. He said that now there are tremendous forces to repel imperialist aggressors if they dare to launch a world war, and they can be defeated.

Khrushchev continued, saying that the implementation of the economic plans of the Soviet Union, all socialist countries in Europe and Asia will create the real possibility of eliminating war, making war no longer a means of solving international problems.

Khrushchev then pointed out that when the Soviet Union becomes the world's first industrial power, when the People's Republic of China becomes a powerful industrial country, and when the total output of socialist countries exceeds more than half of the world's output, the international situation will undergo a fundamental change. The new balance of power will be so obvious that even the most stubborn imperialists will clearly understand that any attempt to wage war against the socialist camp is hopeless. Peace-loving peoples of various countries can then rely on the power of the socialist camp to force the imperialist war-mongering clique to abandon their plans for a new world war. Therefore, before socialism has completely triumphed on Earth, and while capitalism still exists in some parts of the world, it is possible to eliminate a world war from social life.

The fundamental solution to the German problem is to sign a peace treaty.

The German reunification issue should be resolved through consultations among Germans.

When discussing various issues of the international situation, Khrushchev first talked about the German problem. He said that the correct resolution of this issue is of great significance for ensuring peace and the security of all peoples.

Khrushchev pointed out that the fundamental solution to the German problem is to sign a peace treaty with Germany. This would mean a big step towards restoring German unity.

Khrushchev added that the signing of the treaty would also solve the Berlin issue on a peaceful and democratic basis, and ensure that West Berlin becomes a free city with the necessary guarantees of non-interference in its internal affairs. Khrushchev said that the United Nations should guarantee this. We hope to negotiate on all these issues to seek a reasonable solution.

Khrushchev pointed out that since there are now two sovereign states, and if neither can be eliminated without igniting the flames of a world war, then only through negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can German unity be restored. Khrushchev emphasized that there is no other way.

The speaker went on to say that we have never been and are not opposed to free elections. However, the problem should still be solved by the Germans themselves. We hope that all issues regarding the restoration of German unity will be resolved through consultations between the two Germanys, rather than through foreign pressure and interference in the internal affairs of the German people, as Adenauer hopes, or through the method of annexing the German Democratic Republic. To promote the cause of restoring the unity of the two Germanys, we support the wise proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic to establish a federal union, which is the first step towards establishing regular contacts and establishing all-German institutions between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The source of tension in the Far East is the aggressive policy of the United States against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries.

The Soviet Union has always sympathized with and supported the national liberation movements.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the main source of tension in the Far East is the aggressive policy of the United States against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries in this region, are defending the cause of peace. Their joint advocacy of the prohibition of atomic weapons and their testing will significantly help to maintain peace in the Pacific. The initiatives of these countries will be supported by the Japanese people and the peoples of other countries in the Pacific region.

Khrushchev emphasized that it is possible and necessary to establish a peace zone, and first of all, a nuclear-free zone in the Far East and the entire Pacific region.

In his report, Khrushchev expressed respect for the national liberation movements of the peoples of Arab countries and other countries in Asia and Africa who are struggling to break free from colonial oppression. He said that driving the imperialist colonialists' armies out of a series of countries in this region is a great victory for the Arab peoples and all peace-loving forces. The Soviet people and the peoples of other socialist countries actively support the just struggle of the Arab peoples. The prominent figures of this movement—President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic and the leader of the government of the Republic of Iraq, Abdul Karim Qasim—have received the warm sympathy of the Soviet people.

Khrushchev then pointed out that our country and other socialist countries have always supported the national liberation movements. The Soviet Union does not interfere and has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

Khrushchev went on to say that, however, we cannot remain silent about the attacks on progressive forces by certain countries under the pretext of anti-communism. Khrushchev said, "Since someone in the United Arab Republic recently attacked communist ideas and accused communists, as a communist, I believe it is necessary to declare at our party congress that the accusation that communists help to weaken or split the national forces in the anti-imperialist struggle is incorrect. On the contrary, there is no one more steadfast in the cause of the struggle against imperialists than communists."

Khrushchev pointed out in this regard, "We do not hide the fact that we have different views on ideological issues with some people in the United Arab Republic. However, on the issue of the anti-imperialist struggle, on strengthening the political and economic independence of countries that have freed themselves from colonialism, and on fighting against the danger of war, our position is the same as theirs. Ideological differences should not hinder the development of friendly relations between our two countries, nor should they hinder our common anti-imperialist struggle."

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are strengthening friendly relations with countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression, and are now and will continue to assist them. The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee said that our country establishes relations with all countries on the basis of complete equality and cooperation without any military or political conditions. Khrushchev said in this regard, the seven-year plan has opened up new possibilities for economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and industrially underdeveloped countries.

Khrushchev went on to say that now the struggle of the peoples of various countries for freedom and independence has entered a new stage. In various colonies and dependent countries, national liberation movements are flourishing.

The prohibition of nuclear weapon tests is an urgent task.

Different social systems should coexist peacefully.

Khrushchev then pointed out that breaking the deadlock on disarmament is the most important task at present. He said that the necessity of prohibiting the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is particularly urgent. Today, when everyone agrees that it is possible to detect atomic explosions anywhere in the world, there is no reason to delay the resolution of the issue of prohibiting atomic weapon tests.

Khrushchev said that our starting point is that the relationship between countries with different social systems should be based on peaceful coexistence. It is necessary to learn to resolve disputes through peaceful negotiations.

The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee went on to say that now everyone acknowledges the great achievements of Soviet science and technology in opening the way to the universe for mankind. These achievements demonstrate the possibilities of the Soviet Union and the world socialist system. It is quite obvious that if the Soviet Union can launch rockets into space tens of thousands of kilometers away, it can also launch powerful rockets with pinpoint accuracy to any point on Earth.

Khrushchev went on to say, but we draw completely different conclusions from these facts than some people in the West. We do not use the historically significant achievements of Soviet science and technology to pursue a warlike policy and impose our will on other countries. We use these achievements to greatly increase our strength in the struggle for universal peace. And now, when we are ahead in the development of rocket technology, we once again propose to the United States, Britain, and France: let us permanently prohibit the testing, production, and use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons, let us destroy all reserves of these deadly weapons, and let us use the greatest discoveries of human genius only for peaceful purposes and the welfare of the people. Our government is willing to sign the relevant treaty tomorrow.

Khrushchev recalled that the Soviet government had proposed a meeting of the heads of state of the East and West a year ago. He emphasized that the Soviet Union considers it its duty to the peoples of all countries to strive for the convening of this meeting.

Khrushchev particularly mentioned the mutual relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. He said that there is no reason for our two peoples to conflict with each other. However, the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States have long been abnormal. But in the United States, the number of people advocating friendly and neighborly relations with the Soviet Union is increasing. Khrushchev said that the reception of Mikoyan in the United States is a testament to this. His visit gave the American people the opportunity to express their friendship towards the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that the extensive development of world trade will play an important role in easing international tensions and strengthening mutual trust. Despite various obstacles, the trade volume of goods between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries of Europe and America in 1958 was nearly double that of 1950. The economic program of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union for 1959-1965 opens up broad prospects for the development of the Soviet Union's foreign trade with all countries. Khrushchev pointed out that we can at least double the volume of foreign trade.

The speaker said that we propose to the capitalist countries not only to engage in peaceful competition during the seven-year plan. We are formulating a fifteen-year long-term plan for the development of the Soviet Union. This plan is also based on the principles of peaceful development and peaceful economic competition. Our plan is a plan for peaceful construction. We call on the peoples of all countries to strengthen the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. From our side, we will do everything possible to ensure world peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that for the international workers' movement and the communist movement, for all democratic forces, the seven-year plan is a strong spiritual support in the struggle against reactionary forces and imperialism. Now, in 83 countries, there are communist and workers' parties with more than 33 million members. The speaker said that this is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism, a great achievement of the working class.

Khrushchev went on to say that in capitalist countries, there are ominous signs of an attack by reactionaries and fascists. Currently, when there is a powerful socialist camp, when the workers' movement has rich experience in fighting reactionaries, and when the organizational strength of the working class has been enhanced, the peoples of various countries have greater possibilities to block the path of fascism. It is possible and necessary to unite the broadest masses of people from all strata, all democratic and truly national forces to oppose fascism.

Khrushchev pointed out that the imperialist reactionary forces and their lackeys in the workers' movement, such as the anti-communist leaders of the Social Democratic Party, Guy Mollet and Spaak, are obstructing the cause of the unity of the working class. In the ranks of the Social Democratic Party, the majority are supporters of peace and social progress, although they envision different paths to achieve this than we communists do. Therefore, in the struggle against reactionaries and fascism, communists and Social Democrats should find common ground. It is time for representatives of various factions of the workers' movement to spit on those who play anti-communist tricks and sit down at one table to draft a mutually acceptable program so that the working class can take joint action to protect its own interests and defend peace.

The international communist movement is more united.

A fatal blow has been dealt to revisionism.

Khrushchev went on to say that the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties in November 1957 showed that the views of the fraternal parties were completely consistent. He said that after the November conference, the internal forces of each communist party were united, and the entire international communist movement was more united. The revisionists failed to make a fraternal party deviate from the correct path.

Khrushchev pointed out that the international communist movement has condemned the views and policies of Yugoslav revisionists. Khrushchev said that the Yugoslav leaders, in opposition to the declaration, put forward a revisionist program that attacks the Marxist-Leninist position of the international communist movement. Yugoslav revisionists deny the necessity of international class solidarity and deviate from the position of the working class. The Yugoslav leaders claim that they stand outside the bloc and above the camp. In fact, they participate in the Balkan bloc, which connects Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. Everyone knows that Turkey and Greece are members of the aggressive bloc—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

In the development of the national economy, the improvement of people's culture and welfare, the achievements are the best measure of whether the country's leadership is correct. Khrushchev asked, then who has the least achievements? It is precisely such a party and such a country: its leaders boast that their so-called Yugoslav road is the only correct road. If we compare the living standards of socialist countries, then according to the materials published by economists, the living standards in Yugoslavia have improved too slowly. The practice of Yugoslavia itself refutes the theoretical "discoveries" of Yugoslav revisionists.

Khrushchev went on to say that Marxist-Leninist parties are anxiously watching the situation in Yugoslavia.

He said that we have the most friendly feelings towards the fraternal peoples of all nationalities in Yugoslavia, towards the heroic Yugoslav communists who have fought in the underground and guerrilla struggles. On a series of issues in foreign policy, we have a common language. We will continue to develop trade with Yugoslavia on a mutually beneficial basis in the future. On all issues where our positions coincide in opposing imperialism and maintaining peace, we will strive to cooperate with Yugoslavia.

Khrushchev went on to say that the future situation in the party will depend entirely on the Communist Union of Yugoslavia. Its leaders have isolated themselves from the international communist movement.

Khrushchev said that the communist movement has dealt a fatal blow to revisionism. However, revisionism has not been crushed. It must be seen that imperialism will try to support the revisionists and make them active.

All communist and workers' parties are equal and autonomous.

The role of the Soviet Union is to open the way first.

Imperialist theorists and revisionists who follow their tune are trying to destroy the growing influence of the communist parties by spreading lies, claiming that the communist movement is a "Moscow affair," and that communist and workers' parties in various countries are subordinate to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that if one thinks that in some country, a workers' party with tens of thousands, sometimes even hundreds of thousands of members, can be organized from outside, this is a very absurd idea. For example, no one will believe that the Italian Communist Party with two million members, the French Communist Party with fifty million members, the Indonesian Communist Party with one hundred and fifty million members, the Indian Communist Party with nearly thirty million members, and other fraternal parties are "established by Moscow," or that their members are "foreign agents."

The speaker said that some people say that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leader of the international communist movement, which proves that the communist and workers' parties in various countries are "subordinate to Moscow." These people quote the famous point in the Moscow Declaration: "The socialist camp is headed by the Soviet Union."

Khrushchev emphasized that in the communist movement and in the socialist camp, all communist and workers' parties and all socialist countries have been and are completely equal and autonomous. In fact, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has not led any other party, nor has the Soviet Union led any other country. In the communist movement, there is no "superior" and "inferior" among the parties. All communist and workers' parties are equal and autonomous, and are responsible for the fate of communism, for the setbacks and victories of communism. Each communist and workers' party is responsible to the working class and laboring people of its own country, to the entire international workers' movement, and to the communist movement.

Khrushchev continued, saying that the role of the Soviet Union is not to lead other countries, but that the Soviet Union first opened the way to socialism for mankind, that the Soviet Union is the strongest country in the world socialist system, and that it is the first country to enter the period of full-scale communist construction.

Khrushchev vividly pointed out that our party considers itself one of the vanguards of the world communist movement that has first reached the peak of communism.

We believe that we must strive to strengthen the power of the socialist camp, and further strengthen the unity of the international communist movement based on the principles adopted by the fraternal parties in the Moscow Declaration. The success of the national cause of the working class is unimaginable without the internationalist unity of all the ranks of the working class.

In terms of economic competition with the United States, this is not the end.

It is only the completion of the first stage of communist construction.

When discussing some issues of Marxist-Leninist theory, Khrushchev emphasized that at present, when the Soviet Union has entered a new historical stage of communist construction, the issues of Marxist-Leninist theory regarding the transition from socialism to communism are of particular importance. The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee first discussed the issue of the two stages of communist society and the law of the development of socialism into communism.

Khrushchev pointed out that our fundamental practical task is to establish the material and technical foundation of a communist society and to make socialist productive forces have a new upsurge. He said that at the current level of socialist production, we cannot fully guarantee an abundance of material and cultural resources to meet the ever-increasing needs of the people and to enable people to develop comprehensively. Without this, communism is impossible.

Khrushchev went on to say that if we say that catching up with the United States in the economy means completing the construction of communism, that would be too simplistic. Khrushchev said that this is not our end point, but only a decisive stage in the competition with capitalism. Khrushchev added that our victory in the economic competition with the United States is only the completion of the first stage of communist construction.

Khrushchev pointed out that "in this stage, the level of economic development we have reached is by no means the end station for us, but only a transfer station, where we can catch up with the most developed capitalist countries, leave them at this station, and we ourselves will move forward."

In his report, Khrushchev discussed in detail several important issues of scientific communism: the issue of the distribution of the material and spiritual wealth of social production among all members of society, the issue of the development and convergence of the collective farm form and the public form of socialist ownership, and the issue of social and political organization, state structure, and management in the period of full-scale communist construction.

Khrushchev then pointed out that at present, when socialist construction has gone beyond the scope of a single country and a world socialist system has formed, new theoretical issues have emerged in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism.

Socialism has achieved complete victory in the Soviet Union.

The issue of building socialism in a single country has been resolved.

Khrushchev discussed the issue of the possibility of building socialism in a single country. He said that the Soviet state, like any other socialist state, cannot guarantee itself against possible aggression by imperialist countries. However, the current situation of the actual balance of power in the world is that we can repel any enemy invasion.

There is no force in the world that can restore capitalism in our country or destroy the socialist camp. The Soviet Union has no danger of capitalist restoration. Khrushchev emphasized that this means that socialism has not only achieved complete victory but also thorough victory.

Khrushchev briefly said that therefore, it can be considered that the issue of building socialism in a single country and the issue of the complete and thorough victory of socialism have been resolved by the process of social development with world-historical significance.

Socialist countries, relying on cooperation and mutual aid, can simultaneously transition to the higher stage of communist society.

Khrushchev proposed a theoretical principle: socialist countries successfully utilize the possibilities of the socialist system, and to a greater or lesser extent, will simultaneously transition to the higher stage of communist society.

Khrushchev explained that under the imperialist system, the situation of development is: some countries advance at the expense of others, oppressing and exploiting other countries. In the socialist economic system, the law of planned and proportional development operates. Therefore, economically backward countries, relying on the experience of other socialist countries, relying on cooperation and mutual aid, can quickly make up for lost time, improve their economy and culture. As a result, the economic and cultural development of all socialist countries reaches the same level.

When discussing the prospects of mankind's advance towards communism, Khrushchev continued, we must consider that the historical conditions of various countries are very diverse.

Khrushchev said that nevertheless, it must be emphasized that in the development of various countries along the path to communism, the main and decisive factor is the common laws they share, rather than their specific manifestations. Marxist-Leninist parties recognize the characteristics of the development of each country. But this does not mean that socialism can be achieved through another path outside the common path. The characteristics of the path refer to considering the characteristics of the situation and time of a country's development. For example, certain measures taken by the Soviet Union in socialist construction cannot be mechanically applied to other countries. All socialist countries are building socialism, but not all according to a single formula.

The Soviet Union fully agrees with everything of the Communist Party of China.

There are and can be no differences between the Soviet Union and China.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Communist Party of China has adopted many unique forms in socialist construction. However, we have no and cannot have any differences with the Communist Party of China.

Khrushchev pointed out this point, saying that the Yugoslav revisionists are now concentrating their main fire on attacking the People's Republic of China and spreading various speculations, saying that there seems to be a difference between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

We fully agree with everything of our fraternal Communist Party of China, although its methods of building socialism differ from ours in many aspects.

The main point is to maintain and strengthen class unity in the struggle against capitalism, for the liberation of the working class, and for the construction of socialism. On this point, communists cannot have differences and different understandings. Khrushchev said that this is the main point that distinguishes us from the revisionists.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly united.

The strength of socialism is growing day by day.

Khrushchev particularly discussed the development of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the strengthening of its ranks. He asserted that at the time of the convening of the 21st Congress, the party was unprecedentedly united around its Leninist Central Committee, and it could successfully solve the great task of building a communist society. Khrushchev said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union currently has 8,239,900 party members and candidate members, an increase of 1,023,300 from the previous, the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

Khrushchev pointed out that the implementation of the party's general line encountered stubborn opposition from the anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who used the most vile sectarian and splitist methods of struggle, attempting to disrupt the party's unity, sabotage the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress, and lead the party and the state away from the Leninist path.

Khrushchev pointed out that now everyone sees how correct it was for our party and its Central Committee to resolutely condemn and expel the disgraceful factionalists and splitters.

In his report, Khrushchev proposed that some amendments and supplements should be made to the Constitution of the Soviet Union. He said that all the great changes in domestic life and international situation should be reflected in the Constitution of the Soviet state and consolidated through legislation.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people have shown amazing labor enthusiasm in the process of socialist construction. There is no doubt that the seven-year plan will bring about a new upsurge in life, will produce new forms of nationwide socialist competition, and will strive to complete the great program of communist construction in our country ahead of schedule.

Khrushchev said that the seven-year period we are entering is a new, important, and indeed decisive milestone in the development of Soviet history. The Communist Party and all the people of the Soviet Union are filled with firm confidence that they will definitely reach this milestone.

The people of the Soviet Union are closely united and advancing together with the peoples of the socialist camp countries. Currently, nearly one billion people in the socialist countries of Europe and Asia, that is, more than one-third of all humanity, are united under the banner of the victory of socialism and communism. The strength of socialism is powerful, and it is growing day by day. The future belongs to it.

"Long live world peace!"—The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Khrushchev, concluded his report with these words.

    1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字
    赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上的报告摘要
    新华社27日讯  塔斯社莫斯科27日电：苏共中央第一书记尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫今天在克里姆林宫苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上报告说，代表大会将要讨论苏联进一步进行共产主义建设、使经济、文化和劳动人民物质福利获得新的高涨的纲领。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲台上出现的时候，受到了代表大会代表和外国客人们的热烈掌声的欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏共第二十一次代表大会的召开是为了要讨论1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字。他说，这是一个伟大的纲领。它的宏伟规模是史无前例的。
    社会主义国家引导着全体进步人类
    苏联的环境从来没有现在这样稳固
    苏共中央第一书记说，自从第二十次代表大会以来，已经过去了三年。三年来苏联继续满怀信心地沿着列宁的通向共产主义的道路迈进，更进一步地加强了自己的威力，在为巩固和平和争取各国人民友谊的斗争中提高了自己的国际威信。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，社会主义世界现在空前巩固、团结和牢不可破。它对人类发展的整个过程起着决定性的影响。报告人说，可以有充分根据地说，引导全体进步人类的是社会主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫通知大会代表，参加苏共第二十一次代表大会的有七十个国家的共产党和工人党的代表团。
    赫鲁晓夫代表大会代表、全党和全体苏联人民向各兄弟党的领导人致衷心的敬礼。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到完成了最深刻改造的苏联人民的成就时，指出了党及其多年来以约瑟夫·斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导作用。苏共中央第一书记说，过去落后的我国成了强大的工业—集体农庄的社会主义国家。现在苏联的工业产值在欧洲占第一位，在世界占第二位。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，资产阶级的经济学家和政治家不止一次地预言，苏联由于在第二次世界大战后恢复国民经济，将不得不放慢自己的经济发展。但是这种预言像肥皂泡一样地破灭了。苏联的经济继续迅速向前发展。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，改组工业和建筑业的管理是加速发展国民经济的极重要因素。在国民经济委员会工作的短短期间里，管理工业的新形式就显示出了巨大的优越性，对生产的领导变得更加具体了。工业产品的增长速度提高了，挖掘内部生产潜力和利用全国自然富源的工作改善了，工人和工程技术工作人员的积极性和主动性提高了。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到党、工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子对进一步发展全国农业所作的巨大努力时说，最近五年同前五年相比，谷物的平均年产量增加了39％。赫鲁晓夫说，同志们，这是一个巨大的胜利。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在社会主义经济普遍高涨和劳动生产率提高的基础上，苏联人民的物质福利在不断增长。1958年工人和职员的实际收入比1940年增加了将近一倍，农民的实际收入按每个参加劳动的农民计算增加了一倍多。
    报告人指出，苏联各民族和部族的文化达到了空前的繁荣。目前国民经济中受过高等教育和中等教育的专门人材的人数约为七百五十万人，比1913年增加三十八倍。苏联高等学校中学习的大学生大约比英国、法国、西德和意大利等国总和多三倍。苏联高等学校培养出来的工程师差不多比美国高等学校培养的多两倍。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中特别指出苏联科学家、设计师、工程师和工人的卓越胜利，他们建树了具有世界意义的新功勋——成功地向月球方向发射了一个多级宇宙火箭。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，世界上第一批人造地球卫星的发射成功是苏联科学家、全体人民的卓越胜利，是苏联工业——技术高度发展水平的鲜明标志，全世界都欢呼这个胜利，把它看作是人类征服自然历史中的新纪元的开端——征服宇宙空间纪元的开端。
    世界上第一个人造地球卫星是苏联卫星，太阳系第一个人造行星是苏联行星，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记的这些话博得了到会代表的暴风雨般掌声。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联——多民族的劳动人民的国家、各社会主义民族自愿的联盟，一年比一年巩固。近年来，各加盟共和国的权力大大扩大了，这说明苏维埃民主有了进一步发展，并使每个共和国有可能更迅速地发展经济和文化。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的国内和国际环境从来也没有像现在这样稳固。苏联、不可战胜的社会主义阵营具备着制止侵略势力的一切必要条件，它们是各国人民和平和安全的强大堡垒。
    苏联进入全面建设共产主义新时期
    主要任务是建立共产主义物质基础
    赫鲁晓夫在概述1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济七年计划的主要任务时说，苏联人民所取得的巨大成就以及他们在经济和社会政治生活的各个方面实现的巨大变革，使苏联现在有可能进入一个新的极重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义建设的时期。
    赫鲁晓夫简短地叙述了这个时期的主要任务——建立共产主义的物质技术基础，进一步加强苏联的经济威力和国防力量，同时日益充分地满足人民不断增长的物质和精神需要。报告人说，实际上，是要完成一项历史任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，今后七年的根本问题是，在社会主义同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间。他接着提出了在经济、政治、思想和国际方面的具体任务。
    在经济方面的任务是，全面发展生产力，在优先发展重工业的基础上，使一切经济部门的生产获得这样的增长能够在建立共产主义的物质技术基础和保证苏联同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利方面迈进决定性的一步。国家经济力量的加强、国民经济各部门在技术上的进一步发展、社会劳动生产率的不断增长将保障人民生活水平的大大提高。
    在政治方面的任务是，进一步巩固苏联的社会主义制度，进一步加强苏联人民的团结一致，发展苏维埃民主，发挥广大人民群众在建设共产主义社会中的积极性和创造性，扩大社会团体在解决国家问题方面的职能，提高党和社会主义国家的组织作用和教育作用，全力巩固工农联盟和苏联各族人民的友谊。
    在思想方面的任务是，加强党的思想教育工作，提高劳动人民、首先是成长中的一代的共产主义觉悟，用对待劳动的共产主义态度、用苏维埃爱国主义和国际主义来教育他们，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，同资产阶级思想作斗争。
    在国际关系方面的任务是，本着不同社会制度的国家和平共处的列宁主义原则，始终如一地执行维护和巩固和平和各国人民的安全的外交政策。必须争取停止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势。竭力加强世界社会主义体系和兄弟人民的大家庭。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中举出了一些数字，说明他所作的关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济控制数字的报告提纲已经经过了广泛的讨论。全国参加讨论的有七千多万人。在各处会议上提出各种意见、补充和建议的有四百六十七万二千人。此外，期刊、电台和电视台收到了六十五万多件包含有各种建议和意见的信件和文章。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了其中某些建议。
    关于这点，赫鲁晓夫说，劳动人民在发言时都表示决心要完成和超额完成七年计划的任务。
    七年内工业总产值将增加80％
    等于最近二十年来的增产值
    在谈到关于发展工业和运输业问题时，赫鲁晓夫指出，控制数字规定要高速度发展一切工业部门、特别是重工业部门的生产，并且大大提高它们的绝对增产量。
    他说，1965年工业产品总产值计划要比1958年大约增加80％，其中第一部类——生产资料的生产增加85％—88％，第二部类——消费资料的生产增加62％—65％。报告人着重指出，这是非常大的增长。七年计划期间工业产品的增产值将等于最近二十年来的增产值。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，规定1965年生铁的生产要达到六千五百万吨到七千万吨，钢的生产要达到八千六百万吨到九千一百万吨，钢材的生产要达到六千五百万吨到七千万吨。有色金属和稀有金属的生产将提高数倍。用于建设和改建黑色和有色冶金企业的投资规定要比过去三十年的投资还多。其中黑色冶金工业的67％的投资和有色冶金工业的约60％的投资，用来扩大和改建现有的企业，这些企业应该生产出计划增产的铁、钢和钢材的四分之三以上。苏共中央第一书记说，这样利用资金是最有利的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，计划特别迅速发展化学工业。七年中化学产品的总产量将增加将近两倍。矿质肥料的产量1965年要增加到三千五百万吨，而1958年是一千二百万吨，这对有效解决最重要的任务——提高各种农作物的单位面积产量是极为必要的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在燃料工业方面，采取这样的坚定方针，即优先发展石油和瓦斯的开采和加工业。1965年，石油的开采量将增加到二亿三千万吨到二亿四千万吨，也就是增加一倍多。瓦斯的开采和生产量要增加大约四倍，年产量达一千五百亿立方公尺。同时，石油和瓦斯在燃料生产总量中的比重由31％增加到51％，而煤的比重从60％降低到43％。报告人说，在发展燃料工业中采取这种方针有很大的经济利益。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，到七年计划结束时，发电量将增加到五千亿度到五千二百亿度，电站的设计发电能力要增加一倍以上。为了争取时间以及在七年计划中最有效地利用基本建设投资，规定优先建设以天然瓦斯、重油和廉价煤为燃料的火力发电站。
    除了火电站投入生产外，还规定建设如下几个水电站：布拉次克水电站、斯大林格勒水电站、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站、克里门楚格水电站、布赫塔马水电站、沃特金斯克水电站以及其他水电站。还有一系列带有各种类型反应堆的原子能发电站投入生产。
    报告人指出，七年计划规定加速发展所有现代化的机器制造部门，首先是重型机器制造，仪表制造，自动装置设备和电子器材的生产。特别着重创造和生产利用科学技术方面、尤其是无线电电子学、半导体、超声波、放射性同位素方面的成就和发明的最新式的机器。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，由于重工业发展的高度水平和实现提高农业的措施，可以大大增加食品商品和工业商品的产量。七年中轻工业产品总值约将增加50％，食品工业产品总值增加70％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，到1965年，铁路货运周转量要比1958年增加39％到43％。计划对几种主要的运输实行根本技术改造，尤其是对铁路运输，要用经济上合算的机车——电气机车和内燃机车来代替蒸气机车。到七年末了，在全长约十万公里的各主要铁路干线上都要改用电气机车牵引和内燃机车牵引。
    七年计划提出了这样的任务：在工业、农业、建筑业、运输业、装卸工作和公用事业中实现生产过程的全盘机械化，在此基础上消灭沉重的手工劳动。
    与实现全盘机械化的同时，要更广泛地实现生产自动化，从根本上改善劳动条件，急剧地提高劳动生产率。
    七年内农业生产总产值将增加70％
    将完全可以满足食品和原料的需要
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中阐明农业方面的主要任务如下：争取生产水平发展到可以完全满足居民对食品的需要、工业对原料的需要，并且保证国家对农产品的一切其他需要。
    在1959—1965年，规定将农业生产总产值增加70％。生产平均每年增加8％。在这方面，赫鲁晓夫说，应当指出，美国最近七年内农业的平均每年增长速度不到2％。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，未来几年中农业的主要方针，仍然是竭力增加作为整个农业基础的谷物的产量。农业的最主要的任务之一是，提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本。赫鲁晓夫继续说，在七年内应当向农业提供一百多万台拖拉机、约四十万台谷物收割联合机。
    在今后七年内，畜牧业方面的主要任务是，增加肉类、牛奶、羊毛和鸡蛋的产量。苏共中央第一书记指出，我们的国家在牛奶和动物油脂的总产量方面，占世界第一位。在最近的几年内，我们在这两种产品的按人口平均计算的产量方面，不仅要赶上、而且要大大地超过美国。
    在谈到基本建设和生产力分布问题的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，今后七年内国家投资总额将达两万亿卢布左右。如果再加上利用分散资金进行的建设项目，加上集体农庄的投资，以及依靠居民资金进行的住宅建筑，那末投资总额就将达到三万亿卢布。赫鲁晓夫强调说，这意味着七年内的投资额大约等于苏维埃政权整个年代中投资的总和。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，工业基本投资大约要比过去七年增加一倍。国家和集体农庄对农业的投资总额约达五千亿卢布，即比过去七年内的投资总额差不多要高出一倍。
    计划规定执行一些措施来根本改建企业、扩建和在技术上重新装备企业，以及更新设备并使之现代化，这样在很多情况下将有可能比建设新企业更快地解决增加生产量的任务，而花费的财力物力则要少得多。
    拨出了巨额款项来进行住宅和文化生活的建筑。在住宅和公用建筑方面，仅仅是国家资金七年内就要开支三千七百五十亿到三千八百亿卢布，而过去七年内的开支却是两千零八十亿卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在今后的七年中苏联将特别注意利用东部地区的天然资源，打算要把40％以上的投资用到那里去。赫鲁晓夫说，1965年东部地区在采煤量方面的比重将增长到50％，在钢产量方面将增长到48％，精铜增长到88％，铝增长到71％，水泥增长到42％，电力生产增长到46％。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在国家东部建立新的谷物基地，使我们有可能着手根本改组一系列共和国和州的农业生产，以及更加合理地利用丰富的天然经济条件来扩大农牧产品的生产。例如，过去我们不得不在全国各地采购粮食，而目前则有可能不在俄罗斯联邦的西北地区、波罗的海沿岸各共和国、白俄罗斯和乌克兰低洼地的许多地区采购粮食了。这些地区将专门生产奶类、咸肉和工业原料作物，这些地区在这方面具有最良好的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们的计划中鲜明地反映了列宁的民族政策，这一政策保证有广泛的可能性来全面发展各族人民的经济和文化。在规定大力提高所有苏维埃共和国经济的1959—1965年发展国民经济的控制数字中，再一次地证实了这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，实现今后七年内发展工业、农业和运输业的计划，完成今后七年的建筑计划，在大大提高技术水平和提高劳动生产率的条件下是有可能的。赫鲁晓夫指出，七年中按每一个工作者计算的劳动生产率，工业中应提高45％到50％，建筑业中应提高60％到65％，国营农场应提高60％到65％，集体农庄应提高一倍左右。报告人强调指出，到1965年由于劳动生产率的提高而增产的工业品，将占增产总量的四分之三。
    不断提高劳动人民生活水平
    国民收入将增加62％到65％
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，七年计划提出任务要保证在进一步大力发展各经济部门和优先发展重工业的基础上，不断提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    七年计划规定：
    ——大力增加国民收入，并且在这个基础上，大大增加劳动人民的实际收入；
    ——缩短工作日和减少每周的工作日；
    ——增加消费品生产，并提高它们的质量；
    ——大规模进行住宅建筑；
    ——大大改善居民的公共、文化和生活福利设施。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联的国民收入是社会主义制度下劳动人民物质福利提高的最有概括性的指标和实际基础，到1965年苏联国民收入将比1958年增加62％到65％，将比战前1940年的水平几乎增加五倍。到七年计划结束时，职工的实际收入，以每一个工作者计算，将增加40％。集体农民的实际收入至少要增加40％。
    七年计划规定要提高工资。赫鲁晓夫说，在增加工资和降低物价方面，党和政府将始终不渝地执行既定的方针。
    苏共中央第一书记说，但是，这只是提高人民物质福利的途径之一。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，要满足每个人的个人需要，不仅应当通过提高工资的途径，而且应当通过社会基金，社会基金的作用和意义将不断增长。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，七年计划完成后，社会主义企业的积累额将不断增长，最终将成为保证社会主义扩大再生产和进一步提高人民生活水平的唯一泉源。赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联居民纳税的比重现在已经微不足道，一共只占预算收入的7.8％。苏共中央第一书记强调指出，这一切使我们有可能在最近几年内不再向居民征税。
    赫鲁晓夫还指出，资本主义无法解决的居民就业这一社会问题，城市的经常失业现象和农户的大批破产，在社会主义社会是根本不存在的。他说，在七年当中，苏联职工人数大约要再增加一千二百万人，总数将达到六千六百五十万人。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出，国家用于劳动人民公共福利设施方面的经费正在不断增加。1958年，用于社会保险、补助金、优抚金、助学金、免费教育、医疗设施、休假费、寄宿学校、幼儿园、托儿所、休养所、养老院的费用以及其他各种开支和优待等方面，共支出二千一百五十亿卢布以上。按照七年计划，1965年用于这些方面的经费大约将增加到三千六百亿卢布。赫鲁晓夫说，只有社会主义国家，才能拨出这么多的经费来改善本国人民的生活。
    报告人接着说，七年中规定建造总面积为六亿五千万到六亿六千万平方公尺的住宅，即约一千五百万套住宅。赫鲁晓夫指出，这比苏维埃政权建立以来所建造的城市住宅的总面积还多。在分配住宅面积方面的任务是，要过渡到每一个家庭有一套单独的住宅。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，共产党始终认为为缩短工作日而斗争是自己的纲领性的任务之一。控制数字规定我们在实现向缩短工作日和缩短工作周的过渡时不仅不减少工资，反而大大提高工资。苏联将在提高居民福利的同时，实现世界上最短的工作日和最短的工作周。
    加强思想工作发展人们的新品质
    学校紧密结合生活培养更多人才
    苏共中央第一书记指出，为了向共产主义过渡，不仅需要强大的物质技术基础，而且需要社会全体公民的高度觉悟水平。千百万群众的觉悟愈高，共产主义建设计划也就执行得愈有成效。他强调说，我们党和国家的一切思想工作，都是要发展苏联人的新品质，要用集体主义和热爱劳动的精神，用社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的精神，用遵守新社会道德的高度原则的精神，用马克思列宁主义的精神来教育他们。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共产主义观点和行动准则是在克服资本主义残余的斗争中确立起来的。不能平静地等待这些资本主义残余自行消失，必须和它们作坚决的斗争。
    在整个教育工作中党认为年轻一代的成长具有特别的意义。青年现在已经在建设共产主义，将来要在共产主义社会中生活和劳动，管理一切公共事务。苏联青年应当准备担负起这一崇高的使命。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，在对正在成长的一代进行共产主义教育方面，学校占有特殊地位。我们改组学校并不是因为我们的劳动力不足，而是因为我们想进一步改良国民教育事业，使学校同生活更加紧密地结合起来。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，学习同生产劳动的结合，不是贬低而相反是加强所获得的知识的作用。
    报告人指出，我们必须提高国家和社会在儿童教育中的作用。为此要广泛展开寄宿学校、托儿所、幼儿园的建设。1965年寄宿学校学生人数将不少于二百五十万人。幼儿园的儿童人数在七年中将由二百二十八万增加到四百二十万。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，在1959到1965年期间，高等学校将培养出二百三十万名专家，而前七年所培养的人数为一百七十万名。受过高等教育的专家总数在1965年将为四百五十多万人，即比1958年增加50％。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联研究工作者的科学工作计划时说，科学家们在今后一段时期内将首先致力于掌握可控制的热核反应，以取得实际上是无穷尽的动力泉源。规定保证在动力和运输的发动机中广泛采用原子能，在国民经济中扩大利用合成材料、核裂变产物和放射性同位素，解决生产过程全盘机械化和自动化的任务，并为此在广泛采用物理学、无线电电子学、计算技术的成就的基础上创造新的技术手段。
    赫鲁晓夫说，建设共产主义不仅要在经济、科学和文化方面有空前的发展，而且也为最充分地、全面地发挥人的一切创造能力和才干开辟空前广阔的天地。文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、雕刻和绘画工作者负有把创作的思想艺术水平进一步提高的使命。
    七年计划规定为思想工作创造更有利的条件——出版、广播、电视、电影和文化教育机构将得到广泛的发展，报纸、杂志和书籍的发行量将大为增加，特别注意无线电化和建设文化教育机构，尤其是在农村。
    未来七年是经济竞赛极重要阶段
    将发生有利社会主义的决定变化
    赫鲁晓夫说，七年计划是社会主义和资本主义经济竞赛中的极重要的阶段，这个计划将对整个国际局势发生深刻的影响，将是马克思列宁主义的新的胜利。他说，我们在完成计划方面的成就将把千百万信仰者吸引到社会主义方面来，势必将加强和平力量，削弱战争势力。他说，国际舞台的经济方面将发生有利于社会主义的决定性变化。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，由于七年计划的完成，将在实现苏联的基本经济任务方面——在历史上最短期间内在按人口平均计算的产量上赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家方面——迈出决定性的一步。
    报告人指出，1958年苏联工业产量大大超过法国、英国和西德工业产量的总和。现在我们进入同资本主义进行经济竞赛的新阶段。现在的任务是，争取社会主义体系在世界生产中压倒资本主义体系，在社会劳动生产率和按人口平均计算的产量方面超过最发达的资本主义国家，保证人民具有世界上最高的生活水平。在这一竞赛阶段，苏联要在经济上超过美国。
    赫鲁晓夫在比较苏联和美国的经济时指出，苏联工业总产量大约比美国工业总产量低一半，而苏联农业总产量比美国低20％到25％。在按人口平均计算的工业产品产量方面，美国超过苏联一倍以上，农产品方面，美国大约比苏联高40％。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，毫无疑问，七年计划规定工业产量平均每年提高8.6％，这一点不仅可以保证，而且可以超过。预料，在最近时期内美国的工业产量大约每年将增加2％。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，在最近八年内，苏联一系列最重要的产品（钢、生铁、铁矿砂、石油、煤、水泥、毛织品）的绝对增产量超过了美国的指标。因此，苏联在增产的速度方面以及每年的绝对增产量方面都超过了美国。根据苏联和美国工业增长的速度，苏联在完成计划时，它的某些最主要产品的绝对产量将超过美国现在的工业生产水平，另外有一些产品将接近于美国现在的水平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，到1965年，苏联最重要的农产品的总产量和按人口计算的平均产量，将超过美国现在的水平。要在按人口计算的工业产量方面赶上和超过美国，或许在完成七年计划以后，还需要五年。到这个时候，也可能更早一些，苏联就会在工业产品的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面占世界第一位。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，这将是社会主义在国际舞台上同资本主义进行和平竞赛中取得的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，高速度是现在为社会主义阵营各国的经验所证实了的社会主义普遍规律性。他列举数字和事实说明中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业生产的发展。赫鲁晓夫指出，1958年社会主义国家工业生产比1937年增加了四倍。某些人民民主国家已经进入完成社会主义建设的时期。它们像苏联一样地建设共产主义社会的时期日益临近。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，世界社会主义体系作为一个整体来说，在按人口平均计算的工业品产量方面，已经赶上了世界资本主义体系。据经济学家计算，在苏联发展国民经济七年计划完成和超额完成后以及由于人民民主国家的经济高速度发展，世界社会主义体系各国的产量将占世界工业总产量的一半以上。
    社会主义阵营各国拥有一切必要的前提，在世界产量方面赢得领先地位。生产发展速度方面的优势是在世界社会主义体系这一边。
    最近五年（1954—1958年）内，整个社会主义阵营的工业生产每年平均增长率为11％，而整个资本主义世界则不到3％。国际分工、尤其是这种分工的高级形式——专业化和协作将在社会主义阵营的经济发展方面起很大作用。若是单枪匹马，任何一个国家都不可能有像社会主义国家体系这样蓬勃的发展速度。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到国外对苏联发布的1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字的反应时指出，七年计划现在是全世界舆论注意的中心。
    朋友们热烈欢迎苏联共产主义建设计划。在敌人的营垒里，控制数字引起了他们的惊惶失措和手忙脚乱。苏共中央第一书记指出，我们有充分权利说，七年计划已取得了第一个胜利，因为它已赢得了整个国际的普遍承认。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西方有人说，我们提出了“挑战”。但是，这是在和平发展经济和提高人民生活水平方面进行竞赛的挑战。我们希望的是，不在扩充军备方面和制造原子弹、氢弹和火箭方面进行竞赛，而在工业品、肉类、油类、奶类、服装、靴鞋和其他消费品的生产方面进行竞赛。
    七年计划对维护和平将起巨大作用社会主义阵营的威力可能消除战争赫鲁晓夫接着谈到国际局势问题。他着重指出，七年计划再一次反映苏联的列宁主义和平政策。他说，七年计划的实现对解决当代根本问题——维护世界和平的问题将起巨大作用。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，七年计划的意义首先在于它充满爱好和平的精神。一个国家既然在展开新工厂、电站、矿井和其他企业的宏伟建设，既然拨款将近四千亿卢布来进行住宅建筑和公用设施建筑，并且致力于大大提高人民生活水平，它的目标当然就是和平，而不是战争。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，其次，完成七年计划将使苏联经济力量增强到这种程度，使得苏联的经济力量加上社会主义各国经济力量的增强能保证国际舞台的力量对比处于有利于和平的决定性优势，从而为防止世界大战、维护世界和平创造新的、更加有利的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫说，第二十次党代表大会关于战争并不是注定不可避免的结论，已证明是完全正确的。他说，现在有着巨大的力量来回击帝国主义侵略者，如果他们敢于发动世界大战的话，就能够打败他们。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏联、欧洲和亚洲所有社会主义国家的经济计划的实现，将创造消除战争的现实可能，使战争不再是解决国际问题的手段。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，当苏联成为世界上第一个工业强国，当中华人民共和国变成强大的工业国家，而社会主义国家的总产量超过世界产量的半数以上时，国际局势将发生根本的变化。新的力量对比关系将明显到连最顽固不化的帝国主义者也会清楚地了解：对社会主义阵营发动战争的任何企图都是没有希望的。爱好和平的各国人民那时可以依靠社会主义阵营的威力，迫使帝国主义好战集团放弃新的世界大战计划。因此，在社会主义还没有在地球上彻底胜利以前，在资本主义还在世界部分地区存在的时候，把世界大战从社会生活中消除出去，是有实际可能的。
    缔结和约是根本解决德国问题办法
    德国统一问题应由德国人协商解决
    在谈到国际局势的各种问题时，赫鲁晓夫首先谈到了德国问题。他说，这个问题的正确解决，对于确保和平和各国人民安全具有很大意义。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，根本解决德国问题的办法是缔结对德和约。这将意味着向恢复德国统一迈进一大步。
    赫鲁晓夫补充说，和约的缔结也会使柏林问题在和平、民主的基础上得到解决，并保证使西柏林成为一个有内政不受干涉的必要保障的自由城市。赫鲁晓夫说，应当使联合国来保证这一点。我们希望就所有这些问题进行谈判，以便求得这些问题的合理解决。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，既然现在有两个主权国家，并且如果不燃起世界大战的烽火，哪一个都不可能被消灭，那么就只有通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的谈判才能恢复德国的统一。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，别的办法是没有的。
    报告人接着说，我们过去和现在都不反对自由选举。可是仍然应该由德国人自己来解决问题。我们希望关于德国恢复统一的一切问题都通过两个德国的协商来解决，而不是像阿登纳所希望的那样，通过外国的压力和外国干涉德国人民内政的方法以及通过吞并德意志民主共和国的方法来解决。为了促进两个德国的恢复统一的事业，我们支持德意志民主共和国政府关于建立邦联的明智建议，这个建议是德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国之间建立经常联系和建立全德机构的首要步骤。
    美国侵略政策是远东紧张局势根源
    苏联一贯同情和支持民族解放运动
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，远东紧张局势的主要根源是美国对中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平国家的侵略政策。苏联、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国，以及印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和世界这一地区的其他一些国家都在捍卫着和平事业。它们在禁止原子武器及其试验方面的共同主张，将会在决定性的程度上有助于维护太平洋的和平。这些国家的倡议将会受到日本和太平洋区域其他国家人民的支持。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，有可能而且有必要在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平地区，首先是建立无原子武器地区。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中对摆脱殖民主义压迫的阿拉伯国家人民和亚非其他国家人民的民族解放运动表示敬意。他说，把帝国主义殖民主义者的军队从这一地区的一系列国家中赶出去，这是阿拉伯国家人民和一切爱好和平力量的巨大胜利。苏联人民和其他社会主义国家人民积极支持阿拉伯国家人民的正义斗争。这一运动的著名人士——阿拉伯联合共和国总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔和伊拉克共和国政府领导人阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·卡塞姆得到了苏联人民的热烈同情。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，我国和其他社会主义国家一贯支持民族解放运动。苏联没有干涉而且也不打算干涉别国内政。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，但是，对于某些国家在反共的虚伪口号下攻击进步力量，我们不能不表示自己的态度。赫鲁晓夫说，“既然在阿拉伯联合共和国最近有人攻击共产主义思想，并且指责共产党人，那么，我作为一个共产党员认为有必要在我们共产党代表大会上声明：指责共产党人，说他们帮助削弱或是分裂反帝斗争中的民族力量，这是不正确的。相反地，再也没有人比共产党人更加坚定不移地忠于反对殖民主义者的斗争事业。”
      赫鲁晓夫在这方面指出，“我们并不讳言，我们同阿拉伯联合共和国某些人士在意识形态方面观点不同。但是，在反帝斗争问题上，在加强摆脱了殖民主义的国家的政治和经济独立方面，在同战争危险进行斗争方面，我们的立场同这些人的立场是相同的。意识形态的分歧不应妨碍我们两国友好关系的发展，不应妨碍我们共同的反帝斗争。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联和其他社会主义国家正加强同摆脱了殖民主义压迫的国家的友好联系，现在和将来都援助它们。苏共中央第一书记说，我国在完全平等和合作而不附有任何军事和政治条件的基础上同一切国家建立关系。赫鲁晓夫在这方面说道，七年计划为苏联同工业不发达国家的经济合作打开了新的可能性。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，现在各国人民争取自由和独立的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。在各殖民地和附属国，民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。
    禁止核武器试验是当前迫切任务
    不同社会制度的国家应和平共处
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，打破裁军问题的僵局是当前最重要的任务。他说，禁止原子武器和氢武器试验的必要性特别迫切。在大家都认为有可能发现世界上任何地方进行原子爆炸的今天，没有任何理由来拖延解决禁止原子武器试验的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们的出发点是，不同社会制度国家之间的关系应该建立在和平共处的基础上。必须学会用和平谈判的方法来解决争端。
    苏共中央第一书记接着说，现在大家都承认，为人类开辟了通向宇宙之路的苏联科学技术取得了多么大的成就。这些成就表明苏联和世界社会主义体系所拥有的可能性。十分显然，如果苏联能把火箭发射到几十万公里的宇宙空间，那么它也可以把强大的火箭百发百中地发射到地球上的任何一点。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，可是，我们从这些事实中得出同西方某些人士完全不同的结论。我们不是用苏联科学技术的具有历史意义的成就来实行好战政策，来把自己的意志强加在其他国家的身上。我们利用这些成就来大大增加我们在争取普遍和平的斗争中的力量。而现在，当我们在发展火箭技术方面占优势的时候，我们再次向美国、英国和法国建议：让我们永远禁止试验、制造和使用原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器，让我们销毁这种致命武器的一切储备，让我们把人类天才的最伟大发现只用于和平目的和人们的福利。我们政府愿意明天就签订相应的条约。
    赫鲁晓夫追述说，苏联政府在一年多以前曾建议举行东西方国家政府首脑会议。他着重指出，苏联认为，争取召开这个会议是它对各国人民的义务。
    赫鲁晓夫特别提到了苏美之间的相互关系。他说，没有原因使得我们两国人民互相冲突。然而苏美之间关系却长期是不正常的。可是在美国，主张同苏联保持友好睦邻关系的人数在不断增加。赫鲁晓夫说，米高扬在美国所受到的接待就是一个明证。他的访问使美国人民有机会表达对苏联各族人民的友情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，广泛发展世界贸易，对缓和国际紧张局势和加强相互信任，将起重要的作用。尽管有着各种阻碍，但是1958年苏联和欧美各资本主义国家之间的商品交易额，比1950年增加了将近两倍。1959—1965年的苏联和平建设的经济纲领，为苏联同一切国家的对外贸易的发展开辟广阔的前景。赫鲁晓夫指出，我们至少能够使对外贸易额扩大一倍。
    报告人说，我们向资本主义国家建议不仅仅在七年计划期间进行和平竞赛。我们正在制订一个包括十五年的苏联发展的远景计划。这一计划也是以和平发展与和平的经济竞赛的原则基础为依据的。我们的计划是和平建设的计划。我们号召各国人民加强维护和巩固和平的斗争。从我们这方面来讲，我们将尽一切可能保障世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，对于国际工人运动和共产主义运动来说，对于一切民主力量来说，七年计划是给它们在同反动势力和帝国主义的斗争中的一个强大的精神支持。现在在八十三个国家中有共产党和工人党，它们拥有三千三百万以上的党员。报告人说，这是马克思列宁主义的重大胜利，是工人阶级的巨大成果。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在资本主义国家里出现了反动派和法西斯主义进攻的凶险迹象。目前，当存在着强大的社会主义阵营的时候，当工人运动已有同反动派斗争的丰富经验的时候，当工人阶级的组织性已经加强了的时候，各国人民就有更大的可能性来堵塞法西斯主义的道路。可以、而且必须联合各阶层最广大的人民、一切民主的、真正民族的力量来反对法西斯主义。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义反动势力及其在工人运动中的走狗如社会民主党的反共首领居伊·摩勒和斯巴克之流，阻挠着工人阶级团结的事业。在社会民主党的队伍中，大多数是和平和社会进步的拥护者，尽管他们所设想的达到这一点的道路同我们共产党人不同。因此，在反对反动派和法西斯主义的斗争中，共产党人和社会民主党人应当找到共同的语言。是时候了，工人运动各种派别的代表应当唾弃玩反共把戏的人而坐到一张桌子上来拟订互相可以接受的纲领，以使工人阶级能够采取共同行动来保护自身利益和捍卫和平。
    国际共产主义运动更加团结
    给了修正主义以致命的打击
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，1957年11月各国共产党和工人党的代表会议表明，兄弟党的观点完全一致。他说，在11月会议以后，每个共产党的内部力量团结了，整个国际共产主义运动更加团结了。修正主义者未能使一个兄弟党离开正路。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，国际共产主义运动谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者的观点和政策。赫鲁晓夫说，南斯拉夫领导人为了对抗宣言，提出了一个修正主义的纲领，它攻击国际共产主义运动的马克思列宁主义立场。南斯拉夫修正主义者否认阶级的国际团结的必要性，离开工人阶级的立场。南斯拉夫领导人硬说，他们站在集团之外，超然于阵营之上。虽然事实上，他们参加了巴尔干集团，这个集团连结着南斯拉夫、土耳其和希腊。大家都知道，土耳其和希腊是侵略集团——北大西洋公约组织的成员国。
    在发展国民经济、提高人民文化和福利方面的成就是检验国家领导方针是否正确的最好尺度。赫鲁晓夫问道，那么谁取得的成就最小呢？恰恰是这样的党和这样的国家：它的领导人吹嘘自己的、所谓南斯拉夫道路是唯一正确的道路。如果把社会主义各国的生活水平比较一下，那么，根据经济学家发表的材料，南斯拉夫的生活水平提高得太慢了。南斯拉夫的实践本身驳倒了南斯拉夫修正主义者的理论“发现”。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，马克思列宁主义政党不安地注视着南斯拉夫发生的事情。
    他说，我们对兄弟般的南斯拉夫各族人民、对从事过地下斗争和游击斗争的英雄的南斯拉夫共产党人怀着最友好的感情。在外交政策的一系列问题上，我们有着共同的语言。我们今后也要在互利的基础上同南斯拉夫发展贸易。在我们的立场彼此吻合的反对帝国主义、维护和平的一切问题上，我们将努力同南斯拉夫合作。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，今后在党的方面的情况如何，一切都将取决于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟。它的领导人自己把自己孤立于国际共产主义运动之外。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共产主义运动给了修正主义以致命的打击。但是修正主义还没有被粉碎。应当看到，帝国主义将竭力设法支持修正主义者并使他们积极活动。
    各国共产党和工人党都平等自主
    苏联的作用在于首先开辟了道路
    帝国主义理论家和跟着他们的调子叫喊的修正主义者，企图破坏日益增长的共产党的影响，正在散布谎言，硬说什么共产主义运动是“莫斯科干的事情”，还说什么各国共产党和工人党是从属于苏联共产党的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果认为在某一个国家里，似乎可以从外部某一个地方来组织一个往往拥有几十万、有时甚至是几百万党员的工人阶级政党，这种想法是很荒谬的。例如，谁都不会相信，有二百万党员的意大利共产党、有五十万党员的法国共产党、有一百五十万党员的印度尼西亚共产党、有将近三十万党员的印度共产党和其它兄弟党，会是“莫斯科建立的”，或者它们的党员是“外国代理人”。
    报告人说，有人说，苏联共产党是国际共产主义运动的首脑这种说法，证明了各国共产党和工人党“附属”于莫斯科。这些人引用了莫斯科会议宣言中著名的论点：“社会主义国家阵营以苏联为首”。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，不论在共产主义运动中或在社会主义阵营中，所有共产党和工人党以及各社会主义国家过去和现在都是完全平等和自主的。实际上苏联共产党并没有领导其他任何党，苏联也没有领导其他国家。在共产主义运动中，政党没有“上级”和“下级”之分。所有共产党和工人党都是平等和自主的，都对共产主义的命运、对共产主义的挫折和胜利负有责任。每一个共产党和工人党都要对本国的工人阶级和劳动人民，对整个国际工人运动和共产主义运动负责。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏联的作用不在于它领导其他国家，而在于苏联首先为人类打开了通向社会主义的道路，在于苏联是世界社会主义体系中最强大的国家，是首先进入全面展开共产主义建设时期的国家。
    赫鲁晓夫形象地指出，我国共产党认为自己是第一个达到共产主义高峰的、世界共产主义运动的先锋队之一。
    我们认为必须尽力加强社会主义阵营的力量，根据各兄弟党在莫斯科宣言中所采纳的原则进一步加强国际共产主义运动的团结。工人阶级的民族事业的成功没有一切工人阶级队伍的国际主义团结是不可思议的。
    在经济方面赶上美国并不是终点
    只是完成共产主义建设头一阶段
    在谈到马克思列宁主义理论的若干问题时，赫鲁晓夫强调说，目前，当苏联进入共产主义建设的新的历史阶段时，马克思列宁主义理论上有关从社会主义过渡到共产主义的问题就具有特别重要的意义。苏共中央第一书记首先谈到了关于共产主义社会的两个阶段和社会主义发展为共产主义的规律的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我国的基本实际任务是建立共产主义社会的物质技术基础，使社会主义生产力有新的蓬勃高涨。他说，在目前的社会主义生产的水平下，我们还不能完全保证有丰裕的物质和文化资料来满足人们日益增长的需要和使人们得到全面发展。而没有这一点，就不可能有共产主义。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，如果说我们在经济方面赶上了美国就是完成了共产主义建设，那就未免太简单化了。赫鲁晓夫说，这不是我们前进的终点，而仅仅是同资本主义竞赛中的决定性阶段。赫鲁晓夫补充说，我们在同美国的经济竞赛中取得胜利，这仅仅是完成共产主义建设的头一个阶段。
    赫鲁晓夫指出“在这个阶段中所达到的经济发展水平对于我们来说决不是终点站，而只不过是一个错车站，在这个错车站上我们将可以追上最发达的资本主义国家，把它留在这个站上，而我们自己却向前迈进。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中详细地谈到了科学共产主义的若干重要问题：社会生产的物质和精神财富在社会全体成员中间的分配问题，关于社会主义所有制的集体农庄形式和全民形式的发展和接近的道路的问题，以及在全面展开共产主义建设时期社会政治组织、国家结构和管理的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，目前当社会主义建设越出了一国的范围的时候，当形成了世界社会主义体系的时候，就出现了为争取社会主义和共产主义胜利而斗争的新的理论问题。
    社会主义已在苏联取得彻底胜利
    一国建成社会主义问题已经解决
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了在单独一个国家内可以建成社会主义的可能性的问题。他说，苏维埃国家像其他任何社会主义国家一样，不能保障自己不受到帝国主义国家可能的侵略。但是现在世界实际力量的对比情况是，我们能够击退敌人的任何侵犯。
    世界上没有一种力量能够在我国恢复资本主义，能够摧毁社会主义阵营。苏联没有资本主义复辟的危险性。赫鲁晓夫强调说，这意味着社会主义不仅取得了完全的胜利，而且取得了彻底的胜利。
    赫鲁晓夫简要地说，因此，可以认为，在一国建成社会主义的问题以及社会主义取得完全和彻底胜利的问题已经由社会发展的具有世界历史意义的进程解决了。
    社会主义国家依靠合作和互助
    能同时过渡到共产主义高级阶段
    赫鲁晓夫提出一个理论性的原理：社会主义国家成功地利用社会主义制度中所具有的可能性，将在或大或小的程度上同时过渡到共产主义社会的高级阶段。
    赫鲁晓夫解释说，在帝国主义制度下，发展的情况是：一些国家靠牺牲别的国家而前进，压制和剥削别的国家。在社会主义的经济制度中起作用的是有计划、按比例发展的规律。因此，从前经济上落后的国家依靠其他社会主义国家的经验，依靠合作和互助，就能够迅速挽回时间，提高自己的经济和文化。结果使所有社会主义国家的经济和文化发展达到同样的水平。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到人类向共产主义前进的前景时继续说，我们应当考虑到，各个国家的历史条件是非常多种多样的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，尽管如此，必须强调指出，在各国沿着通向共产主义的道路的发展中，主要的、起决定作用的是这些国家共有的规律性，而不是它们的特殊表现。马克思列宁主义政党承认每个国家发展的特点。但这并不是说，可以通过共同道路以外的另一条道路达到社会主义。道路的特点指的是考虑一个国家发展所处的状况和时间的特点。例如，苏联在社会主义建设中，曾经采取过的某些措施不可能机械地用于其他国家。所有社会主义国家都在建设社会主义，然而并不是全都按照一个公式。
    苏联完全同意中国共产党的一切
    中苏没有也不可能有任何分歧
    赫鲁晓夫指出，中国共产党在社会主义建设中采取许多独特的形式。但是我们同中国共产党没有、而且也不可能有任何分歧。
    赫鲁晓夫就这一点指出，南斯拉夫的修正主义者现在集中了主要火力攻击中华人民共和国，并且散布种种猜测，说中共和苏共之间似乎存在着分歧。
    我们对兄弟的中国共产党的一切都完全同意，尽管它建设社会主义的方法在许多方面和我们的方法不同。
    主要之点是，在反对资本主义、争取工人阶级的解放、争取建成社会主义的斗争中维护和加强阶级团结。在这一点上，共产党人是不能有分歧和不同理解的。赫鲁晓夫说，这就是区别我们和修正主义者的主要之点。
    苏联共产党空前地团结一致
    社会主义力量日益壮大成长
    赫鲁晓夫特别谈到苏联共产党的发展、它的队伍的加强。他断言，在召开第二十一次代表大会时，党空前一致地团结在它的列宁主义中央委员会的周围，它能够顺利地解决建设共产主义社会的伟大任务。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联共产党目前在自己的队伍中有八百二十三万九千名党员和预备党员，比上一次、即苏共第二十次代表大会时增加了一百零两万三千名。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，党的总路线的实施曾经遭到马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的顽固反对，这个集团采用了最卑劣的宗派和分裂的斗争手法，企图破坏党的团结，破坏第二十次代表大会决议的执行，使党和国家离开列宁主义的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在所有的人都看到，我们的党及其中央委员会坚决谴责和摒弃了可耻的派别活动分子和分裂分子集团是多么的正确。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中建议必须对苏联宪法进行若干修改和补充。他说，国内生活和国际情况中一切巨大改变都应该在苏维埃国家的宪法中反映出来，并且从立法上巩固下来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民在社会主义建设过程中表现了惊人的劳动热情。没有疑问，七年计划将会在生活中引起新的热潮，将会产生全民性社会主义竞赛的新形式，以争取提前完成我国共产主义建设伟大纲领的任务。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们所进入的七年在苏联历史发展的道路上是一个新的、重要的、可以说是决定性的里程碑。共产党、全体苏联人民都充满坚定的信心，他们一定能达到这个里程碑。
    苏联人民同社会主义阵营各国人民紧密地团结前进。目前欧亚两洲社会主义国家将近十亿的人民，即占全人类三分之一以上的人民，团结在社会主义和共产主义的胜利旗帜下。社会主义力量是强大的，它一天天壮大成长。未来是属于它的。
    “世界和平万岁！”——苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫用这句话结束了他的报告。
