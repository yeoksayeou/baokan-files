    Focusing on Collective Welfare Undertakings of People's Communes
    Sichuan Launches Hygiene Campaign
    Chengdu, January 30th (Our Newspaper) – The broad masses of people in Sichuan Province are deeply engaged in a mass patriotic hygiene movement centered on eliminating the "Seven Pests" and eradicating diseases. Currently, people in various localities are launching this year's first concentrated campaign in preparation for welcoming the Spring Festival.
    In light of the new circumstances of rural communization, strengthening the hygiene work of collective units, especially public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and other collective welfare undertakings, is the central focus of attention in this concentrated campaign in various localities. The entire province, at the county and district levels, has assisted people's communes in training more than 200,000 health workers, childcare workers, and cooks, organizing them to learn techniques and hygiene knowledge for eliminating the "Seven Pests," preventing and controlling winter and spring infectious diseases, and other major illnesses. In the Wenjiang area, each nursery has at least one trained childcare worker. Party organizations of people's communes in various localities have also formulated specific plans for pest elimination and disease control, and are leading public canteens and other collective welfare units in conducting thorough clean-ups, establishing hygiene covenants and hygiene work systems. Recently, the nineteen communes in Pi County conducted a comprehensive inspection of the hygiene work of all public canteens, the health of cooks, and the environmental and personal hygiene within the commune. All cooks who were ill or unsuitable for canteen work were reassigned; sick commune members were immediately treated; and infectious disease patients were isolated and cared for by designated personnel upon discovery. To prevent the spread of various infectious diseases, various localities have also provided commune members with medication based on prescriptions provided by medical personnel. After this series of efforts, the hygiene work of collective welfare units in people's communes in various localities has greatly improved. Commune members write poems praising: "Public canteens are praised by all, collective living is like one family, men and women, old and young, love cleanliness, hygiene flowers bloom everywhere in the canteen."
    During this concentrated campaign, various localities have paid special attention to thoroughly eradicating breeding grounds of the "Seven Pests," focusing on key areas such as toilets, garbage dumps, sewers, and sewage pits for treatment, and vigorously eliminating surviving mosquitoes, flies, and other pests. After comprehensively surveying the breeding grounds of the "Seven Pests," areas such as Luzhou have universally adopted the method of assigning dedicated personnel, contracting out sections, scheduling regular cleaning, and conducting periodic inspections, achieving clean toilets, clean weeds, clean livestock pens, clean sludge from ditches, and clean garbage, thus eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Many communes in Jianyang, Wenjiang, and other counties, in conjunction with the planning of new residential areas, have sealed unhygienic manure pits, toilets, and abandoned ditches, and constructed new public toilets, manure storage pools, and the like. Leading cadres of the Hujia Commune in Longchang County took the lead, with hygiene personnel providing technical guidance, and commune members working together to seal more than 5,000 unhygienic toilets and dispose of more than 120 tons of garbage within ten days, not only killing maggots and pupae but also accumulating 1 billion jin of fertilizer. In addition, various localities have widely mobilized the masses, especially young people, to carry out concentrated activities to eliminate adult mosquitoes and flies, dig up pupae, and exterminate rats and sparrows, and have universally fumigated livestock pens, sweet potato cellars, and other places where mosquitoes and flies hide, in order to thoroughly eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies.
    In carrying out the above activities, various localities in Sichuan Province have universally adopted the method of delving into key areas and summarizing and promoting past experiences in pest elimination and disease control, finding the life cycle patterns of the "Seven Pests," and creating pest elimination tools, so that this concentrated campaign can achieve even greater results.
    Prior to launching this concentrated campaign, many places in Sichuan Province convened representative meetings of activists in pest elimination and disease control to summarize last year's work. Counties such as Jiange and Wangcang also held debates on issues such as "whether it is necessary to continue carrying out the patriotic hygiene movement," criticizing the complacency and slackness of some cadres and masses. Many places have also made comprehensive arrangements for pest elimination and disease control work in conjunction with production tasks such as fertilizer accumulation. Now, under the slogan of "Welcoming the Spring Festival Cleanly and Neatly," the masses in various localities are pushing this concentrated campaign to a climax, laying the foundation for achieving greater victories in pest elimination and disease control this year.

    以人民公社集体福利事业为重点
    四川开展卫生突击运动
    本报成都30日电　四川省广大人民深入开展以除七害、消灭疾病为中心的群众性爱国卫生运动。目前，各地人民正在为迎接春节，发起今年的第一次突击运动。
    针对农村公社化的新情况，加强集体单位，特别是公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业的卫生工作，是各地在这次突击运动中注意的中心。全省以县、区为单位，帮助各人民公社训练了二十多万名保健员、保育员和炊事员，组织他们学习消灭七害和防治冬春季传染病以及其他主要疾病的技术和卫生常识。温江专区的每个托儿所都有一个以上保育员受过训练。各地人民公社的党组织还制订了除害灭病的具体规划，并领导公共食堂等集体福利单位进行彻底大扫除，订出卫生公约和卫生工作制度。郫县十九个公社最近对全部公共食堂的卫生工作、炊事员身体健康以及社内环境卫生、个人卫生普遍进行了一次检查，把患有疾病、不适合作食堂工作的炊事员，全部调换了工作；对生病的社员，立刻加以治疗；一旦发现传染病人，则隔离治疗，由专人护理。为了防止各种传染病流行，各地还根据医务人员提供的药方，给社员们服用。经过这一系列工作，各地人民公社集体福利单位的卫生工作，已大为改观。社员们写诗歌颂说：“公社食堂人人夸，生活集体像一家，男女老少爱清洁，食堂开遍卫生花。
    在这次突击运动中，各地特别注意彻底根治七害孳生场所，抓住厕所、垃圾堆、阴沟、污水坑等关键地方进行处理，并大力消灭残存的蚊、蝇等。泸州等专区在全面调查七害孳生场所后，普遍采取固定专人、分段包干、定时打扫、定期检查的方法，做到了厕所光、杂草光、牲畜圈光、阴阳沟污泥光、垃圾光，清除了蚊蝇孳生场所。简阳、温江等县许多公社还结合规划新居民点的工作，封填不合卫生条件的粪坑、厕所、废弃沟渠，修建起新的公共厕所、贮粪池等。隆昌县胡家公社干部带头，卫生人员作技术指导，社员一齐动手，十天内就封填不卫生的厕所五千多个，集中处理垃圾一百二十多吨，不仅杀灭了蛆蛹，并积了肥料十亿斤。此外，各地还广泛发动群众特别是青少年开展消灭成蚊成蝇和挖蛹、灭鼠、灭雀的突击活动，并对牲畜圈、红苕窖等躲藏蚊蝇的地方，普遍进行烟熏，以彻底消灭过冬蚊蝇。
    四川省各地在开展上述活动时，普遍采取了深入重点，总结推广过去除害灭病经验的办法，找七害生活规律，创造除害工具，使这一突击运动收到更大的效果。
    在开展这次突击运动之前，四川省许多地方召开了除害灭病积极分子代表会，总结去年工作。剑阁、旺苍等县并就“是否需要继续开展爱国卫生运动”等问题展开辩论，批判了部分干部、群众的自满松劲情绪。许多地方并结合积肥等生产任务，把除害灭病工作作了全面安排。现在，各地群众在“干干净净迎接春节”的口号下，正在把这一次突击运动推向高潮，为今年取得除害灭病的更大胜利打下基础。
