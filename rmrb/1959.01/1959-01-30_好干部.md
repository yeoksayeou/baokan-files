Good Cadres

Two Big-Character Posters

After the work of rectifying the commune began, Zhang Baonian, a member of the Zhouquan Commune in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang, was constantly thinking: Our production team leader, Yu Gengxiang, is always active in his work, and I support him from the bottom of my heart. However, Yu Gengxiang has not taken the lead in participating in production, which is a shortcoming. Should I put up a big-character poster criticizing him? After consideration, he wrote the following big-character poster:

	Production Team Leader Yu Gengxiang,
	Busy working all day long;
	Has a problem not so good,
	Unwilling to go down to the paddy field;
	Sending you a big-character poster,
	Hoping you will lead by example.

After reading the big-character poster, Yu Gengxiang felt somewhat unhappy. He thought: The scope of the production team is so large, there is so much work, running around all day long, how can there be time to participate in production? Tang Jinxue, the secretary of the Party general branch, learned about this and went to Yu Gengxiang and said to him: Gengxiang, the commune members can see our cadres' strengths and weaknesses clearly. The commune members put up big-character posters to help us correct our shortcomings and do a good job. We are all Communist Party members, and we should listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind. Moreover, frequently participating in production can allow us to hear more opinions from the masses, discover more problems in our work, and help us improve our style of leadership. Although the words were few, Yu Gengxiang's thinking immediately became clear. The next morning, he went out with the commune members to carry river mud. Not long after, next to the big-character poster criticizing Yu Gengxiang, Zhang Baonian put up another big-character poster, titled "Good Cadre," which read:

	Fourth Team Leader Yu Gengxiang,
	Rarely went down to the paddy field before;
	After commune members raised their opinions,
	Participating in production is now normal;
	Cadres work with great enthusiasm,
	Commune members' confidence is even stronger;
	Hoping you will continue to do this,
	And greatly promote your excellent style.

Branch Secretary Carries Urine

At daybreak, two people carrying iron buckets came out from the Daxi岔 production team of the Sixth Management District of the Liangshuihezi People's Commune in Liuhe County, Jilin. They were Party branch secretary E Tingfu and Party member Cheng Jincai. It turned out that they were collecting urine from door to door.

When E Tingfu went to the county for a meeting last December, he heard about many good experiences from others. When he heard about the experience of increasing production by accumulating urine in other places, he felt that this was a good method and decided to do so when he returned.

As soon as he got home from the meeting, he discussed it with the branch committee members and convened a meeting of Party members and the masses to mobilize everyone to vigorously accumulate fertilizer and actively collect urine. However, everyone was not used to collecting urine and no one wanted to collect urine from door to door. In the past, if the masses did not understand, the cadres would have let it go. But this time it was different. If the masses didn't understand, the cadres would take the lead. E Tingfu discussed it with Party member Cheng Jincai, and the two of them went to collect urine together the next day. In two days, they collected more than 400 catties. Many commune members, seeing the branch secretary taking the lead in carrying urine, took active action in a few days.

Sending Charcoal in the Snow

At night, as snow fell heavily, Old Granny Liu of the Hongqi People's Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, was worried about the lack of firewood for heating her kang (a traditional Chinese heated platform bed). Suddenly, she heard someone shouting from afar: Old Granny, Old Granny, we've brought you firewood for heating the kang. Old Granny was very surprised. In such heavy snow, who wouldn't mind the cold and bring firewood in the night? When she got closer, she saw that it was production team leader Chang Xiao and young woman Chang Guilan, carrying a full back-basket of firewood. Old Granny was very happy and quickly got off the kang, receiving the firewood while gratefully saying: You two are too considerate, this is truly sending charcoal in the snow! Team leader Chang said while dumping the firewood: This is nothing! Your son is repairing water conservancy in such cold weather and isn't home, we should take care of you, this is also the responsibility of being a cadre.

    好干部
    两张大字报
    整社工作开始后，浙江桐乡县洲泉公社社员张宝年老在考虑：我们的生产队长俞耕翔工作样样积极，自己也从心地里拥护他。可是，俞耕翔没有带头参加生产，这是一个缺点。要不要贴他一张大字报呢？他经过考虑，写了这样一张大字报：
    生产队长俞耕翔
    一天到晚工作忙；
    有个毛病不大好，
    不肯带头下田垟；
    送你一张大字报，
    望你带头做榜样。
    俞耕翔看完大字报，心里有些不痛快。他想：生产队的范围这样大，工作这样多，一天到晚东跑西跑，那有时间去参加生产。党总支书记唐金学同志知道这件事，就去找俞耕翔，对他说：耕翔，我们干部的优点缺点，社员都看得清，社员贴大字报，是为了帮助我们改正缺点，做好工作。我们都是共产党员，更要虚心听取群众意见。再说经常参加生产，可以多听到群众意见，多发现工作中的问题，帮助我们改进领导作风。话虽不多，俞耕翔的思想一下子明亮起来。第二天一早，就跟着社员一道出门挑河泥去了。过了不久，在批评俞耕翔的大字报旁边，张宝年又贴了一张大字报，标题是“好干部”上写：
    四队队长俞耕翔，
    从前很少下田垟；
    经过社员提意见，
    参加生产很正常；
    干部工作干劲足，
    社员信心更加强；
    望你继续这样做，
    优秀作风大发扬。
    支部书记挑尿
    早晨天一亮，从吉林柳河县凉水河子人民公社第六管理区大西岔生产队，便出来两个挑着铁桶的人。这是党支部书记鄂廷富和党员程金才。原来他俩是挨家收尿。
    鄂廷富去年12月份到县里开大会时，听别人介绍了不少好经验。当他听到外地介绍攒尿获得增产的经验时，觉得这是个好办法，决心回去这样做。
    开完会刚到家，他便找支部委员商量妥，召开了党员和群众大会，发动大搞积肥，积极攒尿。可是大家对攒尿都不习惯，谁也不愿意挨家挑尿。如果在过去，群众不通，干部也就算了。可是这次却不同了，群众不通，干部就带头。鄂廷富找来党员程金才商量好，第二天两人一起去收尿，两天工夫就收了四百多斤，许多社员一看支部书记带头挑尿，不几天都积极行动起来了。
    雪里送炭
    夜晚，大雪纷飞，陕西乾县红旗人民公社刘老大娘正在为缺少烧炕柴发愁，忽听有人老远就喊：老大娘，老大娘，我俩给你送烧炕柴来了。老大娘很诧异，这么大的雪，是谁不嫌冷，夜里给咱送柴火呢？走到跟前一看，原来是生产队长畅孝和女青年畅桂兰两个人，背着满满的一背笼柴。老大娘很高兴，连忙下了炕，一面接柴，一面感激的说：你俩太费心啦，这真是雪里送炭呀！畅队长边倒柴边说：这有什么！你儿子这么冷的天去修水利不在家，我们理该照管，这也是当干部的责任。
