    Hengyang Begins Production of Silicon Steel Sheets
    A silicon steel sheet plant in Hengyang, Hunan Province, with an annual output of 20,000 tons, has been officially completed and has produced its first batch of qualified silicon steel sheets.

    This silicon steel sheet plant is a modern steel rolling plant mainly producing silicon steel sheets needed by the power industry. From factory building construction to rolling mill (excluding electric motors) manufacturing, everything was solved locally. According to the general construction progress, it would take about a year to build such a factory, but they only spent more than five months to build the factory building, manufacture and install the equipment, and began mass production.

    衡阳开始生产矽钢片
    在湖南省衡阳市兴建的一座年产两万吨的矽钢片厂，已经正式建成并生产出第一批合格的矽钢片。
    这座矽钢片厂是以生产电力工业所需的矽钢片为主的现代化轧钢厂。从厂房建设到轧机（电动机除外）制造都是当地自己解决的。按照一般的施工进度，建设这样一个工厂需要一年左右的时间，他们却只用了五个多月就建好厂房，制造和安装了设备，并且开始进行大批生产。
