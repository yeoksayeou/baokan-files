Another Guarantee for a Greater Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
Half of the Nation's Farmland Has Been Turned Over

    (Our Report) It is an unprecedented and enormous achievement that about half of the country's farmland has been turned over in 1958. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture at the end of 1958: from late August to the end of December, a total of 805,920,000 mu of land was deep-plowed nationwide, accounting for 78% of the deep-plowing plan for the autumn and winter of 1958 in various provinces (regions) and cities. The deep-plowed land has basically reached the depth standards proposed by various regions, of which 65% are one chi or more in depth (including 11% that are two chi or more), and the rest are between seven cun and one chi. Most areas carried out stratified fertilization at the same time as deep plowing, and some areas also combined it with land leveling, ridge making, soil improvement, and watering the base soil moisture. Therefore, the quality of deep plowing is generally very good.
    The deep plowing movement of 1958 was launched after the Party Central Committee issued instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement in August. The provinces of North China took the lead in starting deep plowing, which then gradually spread throughout the country and continuously formed a high tide. According to statistics, a total of about 100 million laborers across the country participated in deep plowing, of which more than 10 million were in Henan and Shandong provinces, and more than 8 million in Hebei province.
    The characteristics of the deep plowing movement since the autumn of 1958 are: the leadership is determined, the ideological mobilization is good, the masses are enthusiastic, the scale is large, there are many creations, the speed is fast, and the quality is good. Such a deep plowing movement is unprecedented in the history of our country. This is the result of conscientiously implementing the principle of putting politics in command and the Party's mass line, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, and under the situation of rural people's communes and the Great Leap Forward. In the movement, large-scale airing of views, big-character posters, and big debates were launched everywhere to overcome conservative ideas and emotions of fearing difficulties, such as worrying that deep plowing would reduce production and that deep plowing was too labor-intensive. The understanding was unified and confidence was strengthened. It is precisely because of these that the smooth development of the unprecedented deep plowing movement was guaranteed under the extremely busy circumstances of the nationwide steelmaking campaign and autumn harvesting and planting in the autumn and winter of 1958.
    In the deep plowing movement, all tools and methods conducive to the development of the deep plowing movement were fully used in various places. And created many new deep plowing tools and methods. Such as the winch in Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, the rope-traction deep plowing plow in Nanhui County, Shanghai, Wang Yushun's double-layer deep plowing plow and Ma Tongyi's deep plowing method in Changge County, Henan, and the blasting loosening method in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province.
    At present, the northern provinces are carrying out the final work of deep plowing winter fallow land, and most of the southern provinces are in the high tide of the deep plowing movement. (Picture attached)

    农业生产更大跃进的又一保证
    全国一半耕地翻了身
    本报讯　全国一半左右的耕地，已经在1958年翻了身，这是我国农村深翻土地的空前的巨大成绩。据农业部1958年底的统计：全国从8月下旬到12月底共深翻土地八亿零五百九十二万亩，占各省（区）、市1958年秋冬两季深翻土地计划的78％。这些深翻的土地，基本上都达到了各地提出的深度标准，其中深度在一尺以上的占65％（包括二尺以上的占11％），其余的在一尺以下七寸以上。大部地区在深翻土地的同时，进行了分层施肥，有些地区还结合进行了整地、作畦、改良土壤和浇底墒水等，因而深翻的质量一般很好。
    1958年的深翻土地运动，是在8月党中央发布关于深耕和改良土壤的指示以后掀起来的。华北各省领先开始深翻，以后逐渐遍及全国，并不断形成高潮。据统计，全国参加深翻土地的劳动力共达一亿左右，其中河南、山东两省曾达一千万人以上，河北省在八百万人以上。
    1958年秋季以来的深翻土地运动的特点是：领导决心大，思想发动好，群众干劲足，规模大，创造多，速度快，质量好。这样的深翻土地运动，在我国历史上是空前的。这是在整风运动胜利的基础上，在农村人民公社化和大跃进的形势下，认真贯彻了政治挂帅和党的群众路线的结果。运动中都各地展开了大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论，克服了担心深翻会减产、深翻太费工等保守思想和畏难情绪，统一了认识，坚定了信心。正是由于这些，在1958年秋冬全民大炼钢铁和秋收、秋种极其繁忙的情况下，保证了空前规模的深翻运动的顺利开展。
    在深翻土地运动中，各地充分使用了一切有利于深翻运动开展的工具和方法。并且创造了不少新的深翻工具和方法。如江苏省南通县的绞关，上海市南汇县的绳索牵引深耕犁，河南长葛县王玉顺的双层深耕犁、马同义的深翻方法，浙江省平湖县的爆破松土法等。
    目前，北方各省正在进行深翻冬闲地的扫尾工作，南方各省大都正在深翻运动的高潮中。（附图片）
