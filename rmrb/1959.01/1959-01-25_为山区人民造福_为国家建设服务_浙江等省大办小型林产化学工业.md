    This newspaper reports: China's forest chemical industry is developing rapidly. People's communes and forestry enterprises in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangxi, Henan and other provinces (regions) have launched a vigorous mass movement to develop the forest chemical industry. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 20,000 small-scale forest chemical plants have been established in various places.
    These forest chemical plants utilize bark, roots, branches, leaves, sawdust, nutshells, and wild plants as raw materials to produce a large number of products with high economic value. The main products currently produced include rosin, tannin extract, calcium acetate, cork, camphor, activated carbon, crude oil, and more than one hundred other types of products, all of which are important industrial raw materials. The quality of the products is very high. The color, softening point, acid value, alkali value, and unsaponifiable matter indices of the rosin produced by many factories have reached a very high level. The thermal conductivity of cork bricks, the buoyancy of lifebuoys made from them, and the water resistance of cork paper have all reached the quality level of the best products. China's vast mountainous and forest areas are rich in forest resources, and the raw materials for the forest chemical industry are abundant everywhere. Therefore, the rapid development of the forest chemical industry has opened up a new and extremely broad road for the full and rational utilization of forest resources.
    In developing the forest chemical industry, all localities have implemented the policy of "commune-run as the mainstay, small-scale as the mainstay, starting with indigenous methods, advancing from indigenous to foreign, and comprehensive utilization." Thanks to the attention of party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province, more than 10,000 various forest chemical plants were established in less than half a year. Hunan Province overcame difficulties in materials and equipment in every possible way, focused on product projects with small investment, large profits, and rapid construction, and actively launched factory construction activities. Now, more than 2,000 forest chemical plants producing calcium acetate, tannin extract, wine, and rayon have been officially put into production throughout the province, enabling the rational utilization of valuable mountain forest resources. The masses have praised endlessly, saying: "There are treasures in the mountains, but no one looked for them in the past. Forest chemical production has opened our minds, every grass and tree is a treasure, we can't eat it all or use it all, thanks to the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao."
    The broad masses dared to think and act, dispelled the mystery surrounding forest chemical production, and many creations emerged. Workers at the Hangzhou Lumber Mill in Zhejiang Province used sawdust to make glucose, and students at the Lishui Forestry School used sawdust to make activated carbon. It is now successful to extract aromatic oil and produce tannin extract from *Masson pine* needles. There are large areas of *Masson pine* in southern provinces of China. Zhejiang alone has 30 million mu of *Masson pine*. Calculating on the basis of utilizing half of it, the output value can reach 1.2 billion yuan. In many other places, the masses have used pine needles to make aromatic oils. All of these have opened the door to a greater leap forward for the further vigorous development of China's forest chemical industry. At the same time, this is also sufficient to show that the technology of forest chemical industrial production is not something unattainable. As long as people seriously study it, everyone can become an expert on the forest chemical industry front.
    Holding on-site meetings, organizing visits, and having old factories guide new factories are good ways to solve the shortage of technical personnel in the vigorous development of the forest chemical industry. In the mass movement to vigorously develop the forest chemical industry in Zhejiang Province, the province, prefectures, counties, and people's communes have successively held more than 100 on-site meetings. Through on-the-spot visits and learning, a large number of technical personnel were trained. At one on-site meeting in Ruian County, more than 300 people learned forest chemical production techniques. After an on-site meeting was held in the Jinqi People's Commune in Longquan County, more than 300 forest chemical plants were quickly built. On-site meetings have also been held in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Henan and other provinces to exchange experiences and train a large number of technical personnel, and the technical hurdle has been initially overcome.

### 为山区人民造福　为国家建设服务  浙江等省大办小型林产化学工业

    为山区人民造福　为国家建设服务
    浙江等省大办小型林产化学工业
    本报讯　我国林产化学工业正在飞跃发展。浙江、黑龙江、湖南、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、江西、河南等省（区）山区和半山区的人民公社和林业企业已经掀起了轰轰烈烈的大办林产化学工业的群众运动，据不完全统计，各地已办起小型林产化工厂约两万个。
    这些林产化学工厂都是利用树皮、树根、枝叶、木屑、果壳和野生植物等作原料，生产出大量的经济价值很高的产品。目前生产的主要产品有松香、栲胶、醋石、栓皮、樟脑、活性炭、原油等一百多种，这些产品都是工业上的重要原料。产品的质量都很高。很多厂生产的松香的色泽、软化点、酸价、碱价和不皂化物等指标已经达到很高水平。栓皮砖的导热系数和用它制成的救生圈的浮力、栓皮纸的抗水性都达到了最优良产品的质量水平。我国广大山区和林区的林产资源丰富，林产化学工业加工的原料满山遍野，因此林化工业的迅速发展，为充分合理利用森林资源，开辟了一条新的极为广阔的道路。
    各地在发展林化工业中，都贯彻了“社办为主、小型为主、土法先上马，先土后洋，综合利用”的方针。浙江省由于各级党委的重视，不到半年就办起了一万多个各种林化工厂。湖南省千方百计克服了物质设备的困难，紧紧抓住了投资小，收益大，建厂快的产品项目，积极展开了建厂活动，现在全省已有醋石、栲胶、酿酒、人造棉等两千多座林化工厂正式投入了生产，使宝贵的山林资源得到了合理的利用，群众赞不绝口，说：“山里有万宝，过去没人找，林化生产开了窍，一草一木都是宝，吃不完用不了，感谢党和毛主席的好领导”。
  广大群众敢想敢干，破除了对林化生产的神秘感，出现了许多创造。浙江省杭州制材厂的工人用木屑制成了葡萄糖，丽水林校的学生用木屑制成活性炭。现在利用马尾松针提芳香油、制栲胶已经成功。在我国南方各省有大面积的马尾松。浙江就有马尾松三千万亩，按利用一半计算，产值可达十二亿元。还有很多地方的群众利用松树叶制出了芳香油。所有这些都为我国进一步大力发展林化工业打开了更大跃进的大门。同时这也足以说明，林化工业生产的技术并不是什么高不可攀的，只要认真钻研，人人都可成为林化工业战线上的能手。
    召开现场会议，组织参观，老厂带新厂是解决大办林化工业技术力量不足的一个好办法。浙江省在大办林化工业的群众运动中，省、专、县和人民公社先后召开了一百多次现场会议，通过实地参观学习，培养了大批技术人员。瑞安县一次现场会议就有三百多人学会了林化生产技术。龙泉县在锦旗人民公社召开一次现场会议后，很快就建起了三百多座林化厂。在辽宁、黑龙江、湖南、河南等省也都先后召开现场会议，交流经验并培养了大批技术人员，已初步渡过了技术关。（附图片）
