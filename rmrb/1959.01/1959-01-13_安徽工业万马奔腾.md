Anhui was a disaster-prone area before liberation. Its industrial base was extremely weak. According to statistics, in 1949, there were only 57 factories and mines in the entire province, with only over 16,000 workers. After liberation, industry has developed significantly. By the end of 1957, the total industrial output value of the province had reached more than 1.5 billion yuan.

In 1958, in the movement of the whole party and the entire people running industry on a large scale with steel as the key link, more than 800,000 large and small factories and mines of various types were built and put into production throughout the province, and the industrial output value increased by more than double that of 1957. As of December 31 last year, the province had overfulfilled the state-stipulated production task of 1.03 million tons of iron by 3.7%, and overfulfilled the state-stipulated production task of 100,000 tons of steel by 29.4%. Iron production increased more than four times compared to last year, and steel production increased more than fifty times compared to last year. The workers of Huainan Coal Mine, in order to support the "marshal of steel" to get started, reformed coal mining technology, and the coal produced last year increased by about 70% compared to 1957. The province ran small coal kilns on a large scale, and the output in November last year was more than the output of the entire year of 1957. Copper production in 1958 increased by 47.6% compared to 1957. Last year, more than 160 machinery factories and more than 80,000 machinery workers in the province manufactured more than 1,100 sets of small blast furnace equipment ranging from 8 to 28 cubic meters, and 698 sets of small steelmaking converters, ensuring the construction of small "foreign" furnace clusters. Electricity has also increased nearly doubled. Machine tool production capacity has increased tenfold. The production of building materials and railways, highways, shipping, etc. have also greatly increased.

With the development of industries such as steel and machinery, Anhui's light industries, such as the textile industry, have also greatly developed. In 1957, Anhui had only more than 80,000 cotton spindles, and there was almost no wool, hemp, or silk industry. Since last year, the light industry sector has newly built and expanded more than 600 factories. Among them, there are 64 cotton textile factories, with an additional 124,000 cotton spindles, an increase of more than 1.5 times the original equipment. The wool, hemp, and silk weaving industries have also greatly developed.

    安徽工业万马奔腾
    安徽在解放以前，是一个多灾的地方。工业基础极为薄弱。据统计，1949年全省厂矿才有五十七个，职工只有一万六千多人。解放以后，工业有了较大的发展。到1957年底，全省工业总产值已达到十五亿多元。
    1958年，在以钢为纲全党全民大办工业的运动中，全省建成投入生产的各类大小厂矿共达八十多万个，工业产值比1957年增长一倍以上。到去年12月31日止，全省超额3.7％完成了国家规定的一百零三万吨铁的生产任务，超额29.4％完成了国家规定的十万吨钢的生产任务。铁的产量比去年增加了四倍多，钢的产量比去年增加了五十多倍。淮南煤矿的职工为了支援钢铁元帅上马，改革了采煤技术，去年生产的煤炭，比1957年增加70％左右。全省大办小窑煤，去年11月份的产量，比1957年一年的产量还多。1958年的铜产量，比1957年增长47.6％。全省一百六十多个机械工厂、八万多名机械工人，去年制造了一千一百多套八至二十八立方公尺的小高炉设备，六百九十八套小型炼钢转炉，保证了小洋群的建设。电力也增长近一倍。机床生产能力增加十倍。建筑材料的生产和铁路、公路、航运等也大大增加。
    随着钢铁、机械等工业的发展，安徽的轻工业如纺织工业等，也有了很大的发展。安徽1957年只有八万多个棉纺锭，毛麻丝等工业几乎没有。去年以来轻工业部门新建和扩建了六百多个厂。其中，棉纺织厂六十四个，新增棉纺锭十二万四千枚，比原有设备增加一点五倍以上。毛、麻、丝织等工业也大大发展。
