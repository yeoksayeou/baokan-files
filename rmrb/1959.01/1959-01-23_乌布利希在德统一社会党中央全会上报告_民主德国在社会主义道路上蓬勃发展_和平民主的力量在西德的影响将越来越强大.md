Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 21st: The "Neues Deutschland" published on the 20th, under the title "The Road to Improving the Material and Cultural Living Conditions of the People," the second part of the report made by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), at the recent SED Central Committee Plenary Session.

Ulbricht said that the central issues that the German people are considering are the issues of the future, the future of Germany, the development of the balance of power in the world, and whether peace can be maintained or a new war will break out. At the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union launched the first man-made planet into space. This great creative action of the Soviet people declared to the world the speed of the booming development of science and technology in the Soviet Union's communist construction. The cosmic flight of the solar satellite proves that the Soviet Union surpasses the United States in all new fields.

In his report, Ulbricht spoke about the construction of socialism in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) after the Fifth Congress of the SED, emphasizing that the GDR, due to its development on the socialist road and the resulting improvement in the people's living standards, proves that it is superior to the militarist-clerical system of West Germany. Along with this, the influence of peace and democratic forces in West Germany will become stronger and stronger. The prospects for establishing a confederation of the two Germanys and restoring German unity have improved.

Ulbricht emphasized that the working class, intellectuals, peasants, and craftsmen of the GDR warmly welcome the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the SED. The Congress pointed out to the people the road to happiness and prosperity.

Ulbricht discussed the socialist transformation of the national economy of the GDR, the problem of opposing formalistic management methods, and the problem of opposing conservatism, subjectivism, and sectarianism.

When talking about the socialist construction of the GDR, Ulbricht said that what is now being carried out is not simply socialist construction, but socialist transformation. That is: developing the people's democratic regime; accelerating the improvement of productivity and developing the socialist economy by adopting the most advanced science and technology; continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the people; consolidating the worker-peasant alliance; carrying out socialist transformation in agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts; and carrying out socialist transformation in the ideological and cultural fields. In terms of industrial construction, attention must be focused on the following aspects: reaching the highest level of science and technology in scientific research and production; improving labor productivity by adopting the most advanced scientific and technological inventions; developing the "socialist labor team" movement; and improving the cultural level of the working people.

Ulbricht then spoke about improving the work of state-owned enterprises, the socialist transformation of private capitalist enterprises, and the establishment of handicraft production cooperatives. He said that at the end of December last year, there were 2,584 handicraft production cooperatives in the GDR, with a total of 67,100 members. Now, about half of the private capitalist enterprises have state investment or have requested state participation in investment.

Ulbricht then pointed out that now that 45% of the agricultural arable land belongs to the agricultural socialist component, the most important task is to promote the advanced experience of agricultural production cooperatives to all cooperative members and individual farmers, formulate practical and feasible long-term plans for each agricultural production cooperative, and organize farmers and all residents to discuss the long-term plans for the development of villages and districts. The Politburo submitted to the Central Committee a draft law on agricultural production cooperatives, which will determine the social status of agricultural production cooperatives in the worker-peasant state. Ulbricht said that we propose a nationwide discussion of this draft so that farmers have the opportunity to express their attitude towards it. He said that now 90% of the rural areas in the GDR have agricultural production cooperatives.

Ulbricht then talked about the socialist ideological education of intellectuals, as well as the situation in ordinary schools and the implementation of political education. Ulbricht pointed out that the outline "Further Development of Socialist Schools and the Tasks of Socialist Schools in the Socialist Construction of the GDR" submitted to the Central Committee should become the object of serious discussion by party organizations in schools, enterprises, institutions, and residential areas.

Regarding the development of culture, Ulbricht said that the increasing participation of cultural activists in social life and the development of national socialist culture are outstanding facts in the development since the Fifth Congress of the SED. He emphasized that the party's line of socialist national culture must become the leading line in all aspects of literature and art. The socialist German national culture is comprehensive, far-reaching, and diverse, accepting the entire wealth of the German national humanism and human cultural heritage and continuing to develop it.

In his report, Ulbricht emphasized the importance of the party's work relying on the masses. He said that socialist transformation can only be realized with and through the masses. The party's task is to constantly learn from the masses, discover and fully promote the new things in the practice of the masses, as well as the new ways and methods that appear in collective labor and life. He said that every party member, regardless of his status, must strengthen ties with the masses and carefully study the suggestions and criticisms of the people. Cadres should establish close and mutually trusting relationships with the working people by regularly participating in production labor or labor in state construction enterprises. Leading cadres should participate in grassroots work. Staff members of party organs should participate in physical labor in production for at least one month each year. Generals and officers who are physically strong should spend at least four weeks a year in the company as soldiers.

    乌布利希在德统一社会党中央全会上报告
    民主德国在社会主义道路上蓬勃发展
    和平民主的力量在西德的影响将越来越强大
    新华社柏林21日电　“新德意志报”20日以“改善人民的物质和文化生活条件的道路”为题，刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在最近举行的统一社会党中央全会上所作的报告的第二部分。
    乌布利希说，德国人民所思考的中心问题是远景问题、德国前途问题、世界上力量对比的发展问题，以及能不能保持和平还是爆发新战争的问题。今年年初苏联向宇宙发射了第一个人造行星。苏联人民这个伟大的创造性的行动向全世界宣布，苏联在共产主义建设过程中，科学和技术的蓬勃发展的速度。太阳卫星的宇宙飞行证明，苏联在一切新的领域内都胜过美国。
    乌布利希在报告中谈到德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以后在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的问题时强调指出，德意志民主共和国由于它在社会主义道路上的发展以及提高人民生活水平的结果证明，它比西德军国主义—教权制度优越。随着这一点，和平民主的力量在西德的影响将越来越强大。建立两个德国的邦联和恢复德国统一的前景有了好转。
    乌布利希强调指出，德意志民主共和国的工人阶级、知识分子、农民、手工业者都热烈欢迎德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的决议。代表大会向人民指出了通往幸福和繁荣的道路。
    乌布利希谈到了德意志民主共和国国民经济的社会主义改造问题、反对形式主义的管理方法以及反对保守主义、主观主义和宗派主义的问题。
    在谈到德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设问题时，乌布利希说，现在进行的不是简单的社会主义建设，而是社会主义改造。这就是：发展人民民主政权；通过采用最先进的科学技术加速提高生产力和发展社会主义经济；不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平；巩固工农联盟；在农业和资本主义工商业和手工业中实行社会主义改造；在思想和文化领域内进行社会主义改造。在工业建设方面，必须集中注意以下几个方面：在科学研究和生产方面达到科学技术的最高水平；通过采用科学和技术上最先进的发明来提高劳动生产率；发展“社会主义劳动队”运动；提高劳动人民的文化水平。
    乌布利希接着谈到改进国营企业的工作、私人资本主义企业的社会主义改造以及建立手工业生产合作社等问题。他说，在去年12月底，德意志民主共和国共有两千五百八十四个手工业生产合作社，共有社员六万七千一百人。现在，大约有一半私人资本主义企业是有国家投资或者已经要求国家参加投资。
    乌布利希接着指出，现在当45％的农业可耕面积属于农业社会主义成分的时候，最重要的任务是，向全体合作社社员和个体农民推广农业生产合作社的先进经验，为每一个农业生产合作社制定切实可行的远景计划，并且组织农民和全体居民来讨论发展各村和各区的远景计划。政治局向中央委员会提出关于农业生产合作社的法律草案，这个草案将确定农业生产合作社在工农国家中的社会地位。乌布利希说，我们建议对这个草案进行全民讨论，以便使农民有机会表示他们对这个草案的态度。他说，现在德意志民主共和国已经有90％的农村有了农业生产合作社。
    乌布利希接着谈到对知识分子进行社会主义思想教育的问题，以及普通学校的情况和进行政治教育的情况。乌布利希指出，提交中央委员会的“进一步发展社会主义学校以及社会主义学校在德意志民主共和国社会主义建设中的任务”的提纲应成为各学校、企业、机关和住宅区党组织认真讨论的对象。
    关于发展文化问题，乌布利希说，文化活动家越来越多和越来越广地参加社会生活和发展民族的社会主义文化，这是德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以后发展中的杰出事实。他强调说，党的社会主义民族文化的路线必须在文学和艺术各方面成为领导路线。社会主义的德国民族文化是全面的、远大的和多采的，它接受了德国民族人道主义和人类文化遗产的全部财富，并且继续发展它。
    乌布利希在报告中强调指出了党的工作依靠群众的重要性。他说，社会主义改造只能和群众一道并通过群众来实现。党的任务是不断向群众学习，发现并全力促进群众实践中的新生事物以及在集体劳动和生活中出现的新的方式方法。他说，每一个党员不管他的地位如何都必须加强和群众的联系，仔细研究人民群众的建议和批评。干部要通过定期参加生产劳动或国家建设企业中的劳动，来建立同劳动人民的紧密的互相信任的关系。领导干部要参加基层工作。党的机关的工作人员每年至少要有一个月参加生产中的体力劳动。身体强壮的将军和军官每年最少要有四个星期下连队当兵。
