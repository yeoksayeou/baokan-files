Living Education
    Zhang Jing

    The practice of Wangting Commune in evaluating "Three Goods" cadres and "Three Goods" members during the year-end summary is very good, especially since it has been implemented not long after the communization, and this practice has a more positive significance.

    This kind of evaluation is a concrete and vivid socialist and communist education for cadres and members. The evaluation is not a passive search for problems and shortcomings, but an active praise of good people and good deeds, setting up living examples for people, so that everyone understands: In the big family of the commune, how to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, and how to promote the communist style of putting the public first and the private second, sacrificing the private for the public, loving the people like relatives, and loving the commune like home. The evaluation process is also a process of carrying out criticism and self-criticism and conducting self-education. The eyes of the masses are discerning; who is good, who is not good, who has some good points, and who has some bad points, they all have a fair evaluation. They praise the good, and also criticize the bad; even for the good cadres and good members they recognize, they affirm their advantages while also pointing out their shortcomings, which is also a living education.

    After the commune implements organizational militarization, action combatization, life collectivization, and management democratization, it requires both lively and vigorous democratic life and strict organization and discipline. This requires the establishment of a closer relationship between the leaders at all levels of the commune and the members. The evaluation of "Three Goods" cadres and "Three Goods" members is playing this role. On the one hand, "loving the people like relatives"; on the other hand, "loving the commune like home," both sides are moving closer to the direction of "Three Goods." Only when the relationship between cadres and members is closer, and the democratic style is better promoted, can the organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization have a more solid guarantee.

    It is worth mentioning that the Wangting Commune Party Committee is also preparing to regularize this evaluation work, not only once a year, but also monthly or quarterly in the future, taking the evaluation of "Three Goods" cadres and members as an important method for rectifying the work style of cadres and conducting labor attendance checks. By doing so, the "Three Goods" cadres and members can be constantly under the supervision of the collective, helping them to play an advanced, backbone, and leading role, and at the same time, it can also allow the cadres and members who have not been rated as "Three Goods" to have more opportunities to catch up after making active efforts!

    1959 is a year of even greater leap forward. The vast number of newly established communes urgently need more good cadres and good members, and urgently need to absorb those active elements who are loyal to the interests of the people and loyal to the cause of socialism into the leadership institutions of the commune. Therefore, conducting an evaluation of good cadres and good members has its more positive significance.

    活的教育
    张竞
    望亭公社在年终总结时，评比“三好”干部和“三好”社员，这种做法很好，尤其是在公社化以后不久，这样做更有积极的意义。
    这种评比，是对干部和社员具体生动的社会主义和共产主义教育。评比不是消极的找毛病找缺点，而是积极表扬好人好事，给人们树立活的榜样，使大家懂得：在公社的大家庭中，应该怎样正确地处理个人和集体的关系，怎样发扬先公后私、舍私为公、爱民如亲、爱社如家的共产主义风格。评比的过程，同时也是开展批评自我批评、进行自我教育的过程。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，谁好、谁不好，谁有几分好、谁有几分不好，他们都有公平的评价。他们表扬了好的，同时也批评不好的；即使是他们认为的好干部好社员，也是一面肯定他的优点，同时也指出他的缺点，这同样也是一次活的教育。
    公社实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化之后，要求既有生动活泼的民主生活，又要有严肃的组织性和纪律性。这就需要公社的各级领导干部和社员之间，建立更加亲密无间的联系。评比“三好”干部和“三好”社员，正起了这种作用。一方面
  “爱民如亲”；一方面“爱社如家”，双方各自向“三好”的方向靠拢。只有干部和社员之间的关系更密切了，民主作风更好地发扬起来了，组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化才有了更坚实的保证。
    值得提出的是望亭公社党委还准备把这评比工作经常化起来，不但是一年评一次，而且以后要做到月月评或季季评，把评比“三好”干部和社员作为整顿干部作风，进行劳动考勤的一个重要方法。这样做，就可以使三好干部和社员经常处于集体的监督之下，帮助他们发挥先进的、骨干的、带头的作用，同时，也可以使没有评上三好的干部和社员，有更多的机会经过积极努力之后赶上去！
    1959年是个更大跃进的一年。广大的新成立起来的公社，急需要为数更多的好干部和好社员，急需要把那些忠实于人民利益、忠实于社会主义事业的积极分子吸收到公社的领导机构中来。因此，进行一次好干部和好社员的评比工作，就更有它的积极意义了。
