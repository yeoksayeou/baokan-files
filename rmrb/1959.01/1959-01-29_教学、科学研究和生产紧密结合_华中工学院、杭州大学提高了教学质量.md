Close Integration of Teaching, Scientific Research, and Production
Huazhong Institute of Technology and Hangzhou University Improve Teaching Quality

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, January 27th) Huazhong Institute of Technology further implements the Party's educational policy, taking teaching as the center, comprehensively arranging teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, to continuously improve the quality of teaching.

    Since the teaching reform last year, Huazhong Institute of Technology has achieved a bumper harvest in teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. Graduation designs and course designs alone have solved 4,500 production technology problems for factories and enterprises. In the school's attached factories, students produced and trial-manufactured more than 700 products, over 70 machine tools, and completed more than 300 scientific research projects and major technological innovations. Among them, the ten million electron-volt induction accelerator, AC computing platform, internal water-cooled motor and transformer, and indigenous electric motors have made beneficial contributions to supporting local industry and improving teaching quality.

    In order to further implement the Party's educational policy and make the arrangement of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research more rational, the school has implemented a "one, three, eight" teaching system (one month of vacation, three months of labor, and eight months of study). According to this system, each department arranges productive labor and scientific research mostly according to professional teaching, and teaching is also combined with productive labor and scientific research. Specific arrangements have also been made for the political and professional studies of students in each grade. In addition to ensuring a certain amount of political study, the study time for basic theory and technical theory has also been increased. It is also stipulated that students in the first, second, and third grades should mainly study basic theory well, and at the same time regularly participate in basic job training and professional labor, reaching the level of third- or fourth-grade technicians, respectively. Students in the fourth and fifth grades mainly study professional courses, focusing on scientific research combined with their majors, and at the same time engaging in teaching and productive labor.

    Huazhong Institute of Technology attaches great importance to the reform and rational organization of course content. For basic theory and basic technical theory courses, on the one hand, it retains the necessary systematic theoretical parts, and on the other hand, it emphasizes that theory serves the major. Homework and experiments should be combined with production practice as much as possible, and modern technical theory courses should also be added. For professional courses, emphasis is placed on combining production and scientific research, using methods such as on-site teaching to closely integrate basic theory learning with production practice, summarize scientific research results, and introduce new achievements in industrial technology.

    (Our newspaper) Hangzhou, Zhejiang – Hangzhou University implements the Party's educational policy, carries out in-depth teaching reforms, and has achieved remarkable results in implementing the "three combinations" of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor.

    In the current semester, teachers and students of all departments in the university have compiled new teaching syllabi for 67 courses. Because teachers and students adhere to putting politics in command and closely linking with reality, the newly compiled teaching syllabi are generally of high quality. The History Department's "Outline for Teaching Chinese General History" embodies the correct view that the laboring masses are the masters of history. The Mathematics Department's "Outline for Teaching Mathematical Analysis" overcomes the shortcomings of the old teaching syllabus, such as simple theoretical derivations, repeated content, and detachment from production practice.

    Along with the reform of teaching content, there have also been a series of innovations in teaching methods. In addition to teachers' classroom lectures, prompts are also issued, inspirational reports are given, student self-study is organized, and debates are conducted. The new teaching methods have strengthened students' self-awareness, enthusiasm, and independent thinking ability, and have also prompted teachers to prepare lessons more carefully, thus effectively improving the quality of teaching.

    Since last summer vacation, the university has set up 24 factories and 9 farms in less than a month. Many of these factories are combined with majors, so they have achieved great success in implementing the "three combinations" of teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. Students in the Biology Department combine their majors with productive labor, and students take turns attending classes and participating in a certain amount of labor, while scientific research is also combined with production. Third- and fourth-year students studying "Microbiology" work in biological products factories; second-year students studying "Zoology" work on livestock farms. When third- and fourth-year students study the course "Plant Resources," they completed the survey of Hangzhou woody plants and the general survey of economic plants in western Zhejiang, and compiled a preliminary draft of the "Handbook of Economic Woody Plants in Hangzhou Urban Area" with 150,000 words, containing more than 350 species of plants. Fourth-year students in the Mathematics Department go deep into factories, enterprises, and design units to carry out teaching and scientific research in the process of labor and production. In just two months, they solved more than 20 mathematical problems of various sizes. For example, the completion of the "Calculation of Pine Wood Load-Bearing Capacity" allows the railway department to quickly find the maximum load-bearing value of pine or fir wood with different spans and different loads, greatly reducing the amount of calculation work.

    Education combined with productive labor has made scientific research flourish throughout the university. After many experiments, teachers and students in the Chemistry Department extracted five rare elements. Young teachers and students in the Physics Department made an electrostatic generator in less than a month and completed the research and trial production of 18 new products in two months. The History Department has recently written more than 60 scientific research papers that are linked to reality.

    教学、科学研究和生产紧密结合
    华中工学院、杭州大学提高了教学质量
    本报武汉27日电　华中工学院进一步贯彻党的教育方针，以教学为中心，全面安排教学、生产劳动和科学研究，以不断提高教学质量。
    华中工学院从去年教学改革以来，在教学、生产劳动和科学研究方面都获得了丰收。仅毕业设计和课程设计就为工厂企业解决了四千五百项生产技术问题；在校内附设工厂里，学生们生产和试制了七百多项产品，七十余台机床，完成了三百多项科学研究和重大的技术革新，其中一千万电子伏特感应加速器、交流计算台、内水冷电机及变压器和土电机等，对支援地方工业作出了有益的贡献，也提高了教学质量。
    为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，使教学、生产劳动和科学研究安排得更加合理，这个学校实行了“一、三、八”的教学制度（一个月休假，三个月劳动，八个月学习）。根据这个制度，各系对于生产劳动和科学研究大都按专业教学进行安排，而教学也结合生产劳动和科学研究。对于各年级的政治、业务学习也作了具体安排，除保证一定的政治学习外，还增加了基础理论和技术理论的学习时间。并且规定一、二、三年级学生主要学好基础理论，同时定期参加基本工种训练和专业劳动，分别达到三、四级技工水平，四、五年级学生主要学习专业课程，以结合专业搞科学研究为主，同时进行教学和生产劳动。
    华中工学院十分重视课程内容的改革和合理组织。对于基础理论和基本技术理论课程，一面保留了必要的系统理论部分，一面强调理论为专业服务，作业和实验要尽量结合生产实际，还增加了近代技术理论课程。对于专业课程，强调结合生产和科学研究进行，运用现场教学等方式，使基本理论学习和生产实际紧密结合，总结科学研究成果和介绍工业技术新成就。

    本报讯　浙江杭州大学贯彻执行党的教育工作方针，深入进行教学改革，在实行教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合方面，获得了显著成绩。
    全校各系师生在本学期编写了六十七门课程的新的教学大纲。由于师生们坚持政治挂帅，紧密联系实际，因此新编的教学大纲一般质量较高。历史系编写的“中国通史教学大纲”，体现了劳动群众是历史的主人的正确观点；数学系编写的“数学分析教学大纲”，克服了旧教学大纲中单纯的理论推导，内容重复和脱离生产实际等缺点。
    随着教学内容的改革，教学方法也有了一系列的革新。在教师课堂讲课以外，还发提示，作启发报告，组织学生自学，开展辩论等。新的教学方法加强了学生学习的自觉性、积极性和独立思考的能力，也推动了教师更认真地备课，因而有效地提高了教学质量。
    全校在去年暑假以后，不到一个月的时间内办起了二十四所工厂和九所农场，其中不少工厂是和专业结合的，因而在实行教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合方面取得了很大的成绩。生物系学生结合专业进行生产劳动，学生们分班轮流上课和参加一定时间的劳动，科学研究也结合生产进行。学习“微生物学”的三、四年级学生，到生物制品厂劳动；学习“动物学”的二年级学生，在畜牧场劳动。三、四年级学生学习“植物资源学”课程时，结合完成了杭州木本植物调查和浙西经济植物普查，并且编成了十五万字的“杭州市区经济木本植物手册”初稿，所载植物有三百五十种以上。数学系四年级的学生深入工厂、企业和设计单位，在劳动生产的过程中进行教学和科学研究。在短短两个月的时间里，他们就解决了二十多个大小数学问题。如“松木负载力计算”的完成，使铁道部门可以迅速地查到各种不同跨度、不同负重的松木或杉木的最大负载值，大大减少了计算工作量。
    教育结合生产劳动，促使全校的科学研究大放异彩。化学系师生经过多次的试验，提取了五种稀有元素；物理系青年师生在不到一个月的时间里制成了静电起电机，两个月中完成了十八种新产品的研究和试制工作；历史系最近写出了六十多篇联系实际的科学研究论文。
