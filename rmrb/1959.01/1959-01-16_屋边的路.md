    The Road by the House
    Zhaoyang
    Old Man Huang's house had a road beside it, bordering a mountain gully, leading straight to the village.
    This road had been damaged by mountain floods for a long time, and it was hard to call it a road anymore. On rainy days, it was, of course, a muddy mess, with puddles big and small, one after another; the shallow ones didn't even reach the ankles, and the deep ones could practically drown a calf. Even on sunny days, the honeycomb-like potholes and the protruding sharp stones made it difficult to walk on.
    This road should have been repaired long ago. Old Man Huang had also thought about repairing it several times. But many years passed, and it remained the same as ever.
    The story has to start more than ten years ago. At that time, Old Man Huang's second son, Changshengzai, was only nine years old. One day, while walking on this road, he tripped over a protruding stone and fell, hitting his forehead and causing a five-inch deep and two-finger wide wound, with blood flowing freely. Old Woman Huang was heartbroken and kept scolding the terrible road. As she scolded, she turned her anger towards Old Man Huang: "It's right beside the house and you don't even bother to repair it, see? One day someone will break their leg!" Old Man Huang felt sorry for his son, and his wife's scolding also stirred up his anger. He leaned his dry tobacco pipe against the wall and said, "Repair it then! I'll repair it right away." He picked up his hoe and basket and walked out of the house.
    Just as he reached the door, a farmhand from the landlord Huang Keren's house ran over and said, "Second Master wants to go to town, and he wants you to carry the sedan chair right away." At that time, Old Man Huang was farming Huang Keren's land. In addition to paying rent based on a 30/70 split of the harvest, he also had the obligation to do odd jobs and chores for the landlord. There was nothing to say at the time. He sighed, put down the hoe and basket, and followed the farmhand from Huang Keren's house. This trip lasted three days. After returning, he was busy catching up on the work in the fields and didn't have time to repair the road.
    Another time, it was one morning after several days of rain had just cleared. The rich peasant Huang Benwang's child, Youyi, was driving his family's two big water buffaloes to the mountain to graze. When they reached the side of Old Man Huang's house, one of the big water buffaloes fell into a mud puddle. Old Man Huang helped pull the buffalo up, but it had already twisted its leg. Old Man Huang felt very sorry, thinking that although the road was used by everyone, since it was beside his house, he should take care of it. He went into the house to get his hoe and basket and started digging mud to fill the potholes.
    He had just started when Huang Benwang's wife arrived. She was the first shrewish and unreasonable woman in the village, nicknamed "Heavenly Chili." As soon as she arrived, she started cursing at Old Man Huang without rhyme or reason, pointing her finger at his nose: "Did my buffalo step on your ancestral grave? You find it so unpleasant to look at, you must have designed it to harm it!" Old Man Huang endured his anger and said, "Who harmed your buffalo? It stepped into the pit and twisted its leg itself!" "Heavenly Chili" clapped her hands and shouted, "Why didn't it twist its leg anywhere else, and it just twisted it when it walked past your house? The road is beside your house, why don't you fix it? Even cats and dogs know to make their nests nice and tidy!" Old Man Huang couldn't bear it any longer, and with a "whoosh," he dumped a basket of freshly dug soil back into its original place, and said in a hoarse voice, "I eat my own food, am I supposed to fix the road for you rich people!" He picked up his hoe and basket and went into the house.
    Old Man Huang was angry with "Heavenly Chili" and thought, "The road is good or bad, what does it have to do with me? I just won't fix it, see if you take me to jail!" But seeing the people and animals passing by stumbling on the bumpy road and struggling in the deep mud puddles, he felt very bad about it and intended to find time to repair the road.
    But at this moment, another thing happened, which made Old Man Huang completely give up the idea of repairing the road.
    It turned out that Huang Keren's eldest son, Huang Jiabao, had returned from the provincial capital, bringing with him a "foreign horse" (note). Every day he rode it around the village. When he saw young women, he charged straight at them. Seeing the women screaming in panic, dodging and hiding, he would laugh heartily. The men and women in the village gritted their teeth and glared at that "foreign horse." One day, Old Man Huang's house had a guest, his niece. She was standing on the veranda when Huang Jiabao rode his "foreign horse" out of the village. As soon as he saw her, he grinned strangely and laughed, stepping on the "foreign horse" and rushing over quickly. In an instant, the front wheel hit a protruding stone, the rear wheel flew into the air, and the person and the car fell into the mountain ditch together. Old Man Huang saw it clearly in the house, grabbed his laughing niece and pulled her inside, closed the door, and pretended not to hear Huang Jiabao's groans in the mountain ditch, shouting for his mother and father.
    Afterwards, he heard that Huang Jiabao had broken his head and leg and was sent to the county town for treatment. He thought that things were a bit troublesome. Sure enough, after a few days, Huang Keren called him over. He scolded him for not fixing the road. Old Man Huang didn't dare to say that the road's condition had nothing to do with him, so he had to promise to go back and fix it. But when he got home, he thought, "Fix the road, so you can ride your foreign horses and show off, and harm people? Bah! I'll leave it there so you can fall a few more times." He made excuses today and delayed tomorrow, never getting started. After a long time, Huang Keren forgot about it, and he was happy not to fix it.
    These were all things that happened before liberation. After liberation, the situation completely changed, and Old Man Huang's thoughts on repairing the road naturally changed as well. But on the one hand, production was busy; on the other hand, he was old and had less energy. Over the years, he just took the time to fill a few baskets today and dig a few hoe-fulls tomorrow, slightly repairing the places that were too difficult to walk.
    Last year, the upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward surged into the countryside, and the commune proposed technological reforms. The first thing was to realize vehicle-ization. Old Man Huang came back from the meeting, and as soon as he stepped on that bumpy road, he thought, "If we have vehicles, we must have roads for the vehicles to run on. In the past, I didn't want to repair the road because I didn't want the landlords to ride their foreign horses and show off; today, can we let the carts carrying fertilizer and grain overturn into the mountain ditch?"
    He returned home and immediately convened a family meeting, proposing that the whole family be mobilized to repair the road overnight. Old Woman Huang said, "So many years have passed, why are you suddenly so busy! It's pitch black at night, it's easy to fall and get hurt." Old Man Huang said, "Now it's the Great Leap Forward, one day is like twenty years, one night is like ten years. People are rushing to make vehicles overnight, if you don't fix the road overnight, will you let the new vehicles run on this terrible road tomorrow?" Old Woman Huang had nothing to say, and the two young men, Changshou and Changsheng, naturally wouldn't object. Then, Old Man Huang said again, "This is repairing a socialist road, not only must the road surface be level, but the roadbed must also be strong, and the side facing the mountain ditch that is often washed away by mountain water must be built with stones." Old Woman Huang was worried that there wouldn't be enough time, but Changshou and Changsheng, two young men as strong as oxen, said, "There's enough time, the road isn't long. If we're going to fix it, let's fix it well!"
    The four members of the family immediately started working. If there weren't enough stones, they moved a few foundation stones from under the veranda. During the work, Old Man Huang urged his two sons, and Old Woman Huang urged Old Man Huang, all working non-stop and secretly competing. The torches were extinguished and relit, the lamp oil ran out and was refilled, and the four people worked tirelessly until dawn, finally repairing the road.
    Looking at this flat and wide new road, Old Woman Huang smiled. Turning her face to see the scar on Changsheng's forehead, she said with emotion, "If your father had been so energetic in the early years, and had fixed the road earlier, you wouldn't have had this mark for the rest of your life!" Old Man Huang laughed and said, "In the early years, what kind of world was it in the early years? We didn't even have roads to walk on, how could we have the mind to repair roads? Now, we are walking on the bright road, and we must also let the vehicles walk on a new road that is flat and wide. Look! Our carts are coming!"
    At this time, the sun had just dyed the tip of the stone mountain red. In the morning light, a long line of new wooden carts creaked and squeaked as they were pushed along the wide road.
    Note: "Foreign horse" means bicycle.

    屋边的路
    朝阳
    黄大爹的屋边有条路，傍着山沟，直通到村里。
    这条路被山洪长久破坏，已经很难说是条路了。雨天，不用说是一片泥泞，大大小小的泥潭一个接一个，浅的没到脚踁，深的简直能淹没一头小牛；就是晴天，那蜂窝似的坑坑洼洼，那凸起的尖石头，也叫人很难下脚。
    这路早就该修理了。黄大爹也曾几次想修。可是许多年过去了，它还是那个老样子。
    事情得从十多年前说起。那时，黄大爹的二儿子长生仔才九岁，有一天走在这路上踢着凸起的石子跌了一交，额角上碰了个五寸深、二指宽的伤口，鲜血直流。黄大妈心疼得不住口的骂那条滥路。骂着骂着，就把锋头转向了黄大爹：“就在屋侧边都不动手修修，看吧，总有一天会把人的腿跌断的！”黄大爹既疼儿子，也被老伴的责怪激起了气，把旱烟袋往壁上一靠，说道：“修就修！马上修。”拿起锄头畚箕，就朝屋外走。
    刚走到门口，地主黄克仁家的长工跑来说：“二老爷要进城，叫你马上去抬轿子。”黄大爹那时种着黄克仁家的田，除了照收成倒三七交租外，还有替东家打零工、做杂活的义务。当时没什么好说的，他叹了口气，放下锄头畚箕，跟着黄克仁家的长工去了。这一去就是三天。回来后，忙着补田地里的活，就没有时间去修路了。
    又一次，是下了几天雨刚刚放晴的一个早上，富农黄本旺的孩子有义赶着他家的两条大水牯到山上去吃草。走到黄大爹屋侧边，一个大水牯掉到泥潭里去了。黄大爹帮着把牛拉起来，牛已经拐伤了腿。黄大爹心里很过意不去，觉得路虽是众人走的，但在自己屋侧边，自己也应该照管。他进屋去拿来锄头畚箕，就动手挖泥填坑。
    刚刚动手，黄本旺的老婆就赶来了。她是村里第一个泼悍、不讲理的女人，混名“天辣椒”。她一到来，红黑不说，指着黄大爹的鼻子就骂：“我的牛踩着你家祖坟呀？你那么看不顺眼，要生方设计的害它！”黄大爹忍着气道：“哪个害你的牛？是它自己踩到坑里拐伤的呀！”“天辣椒”拍着掌嚷道：“为什么在别处没有拐伤，偏偏走到你屋边就拐伤？路在你屋侧边，你为什么不把它修好？猫狗都晓得把它的窝边弄光鲜些呢！”黄大爹再也忍受不了了，把一畚箕刚掘好的泥土，“哗啦”一声倒回原处，哑声说道：“我吃我自己的饭，是给你有钱人修路的么！”拿起锄头畚箕进屋去了。
    黄大爹和“天辣椒”赌着气，心想：“路好路坏同我屁相干，我就不修，看你拿我去坐牢！”但看见过往的人畜在那坎坷的路上踢踢绊绊，在那深深的泥潭里艰难挣扎，很不过意，又起意要抽空把路修修。
    但就在这时，又发生了一件事，使黄大爹根本打消了修路的念头。
    原来，黄克仁的大仔黄家宝从省城里回来，带来一架“洋马儿”
  （注），每天骑着在村里游逛，见了年青妇女，就直冲过去。看见妇女们惊慌地叫着，东闪西躲，他就哈哈大笑。村里的男男女女，见了那架“洋马儿”，都咬牙瞪眼。这一天，黄大爹家来了客，是他的外甥女儿。她正站在楼廊上，黄家宝骑着“洋马儿”从村里出来了。一见到她，他就嘻开嘴怪声怪笑，踏着“洋马儿”飞快地冲过来。一霎时，那前轮在凸起的石上一撞，后轮凌空飞起，连人带车一齐摔下山沟。黄大爹在屋里看得清清楚楚，一把把哈哈大笑的外甥女儿拉进去，把大门一关，装作没听见黄家宝在山沟里喊娘喊老子的呻吟。
    过后，他听说黄家宝摔破了头，跌折了腿，送到县城里医治去了。他一想，事情有些麻烦。果然，没几天，黄克仁就把他叫去了。骂他为什么不把路修好。黄大爹不敢说路好坏与他不相干，只好答应回去就修。但回到家里，一想：“把路修好，好让你们骑着洋马儿来逞威风，糟害人么？呸！我要留着它让你们多跌几跤呢。”就今天借故，明天推口，总也不动手。时间一久，黄克仁把这事忘了，他也乐得不修了。
    这些都是解放前的事。解放以后，情形完全变了，黄大爹对修路的想法自然也变了。但一则生产忙些；二则他年纪大了，精力也差些；几年来只是抽空今天几畚箕，明天几锄头，把那太难走的地方略微修补修补就罢了。
    去年，社会主义大跃进的高潮涌进农村，社里提出技术改革，第一件事就是实现车子化。黄大爹开会回来，一踏上那条坎坷的道路，心里就想：“有了车子，就要有车子走的路。过去不想修路，是不愿意让地主们骑着洋马儿来逞威风；今天，还能让我们载着肥料，载着粮食的车子，翻到山沟里去么？”
    他回到家里，立刻召开了个家庭会议，提出全家出动，连夜把路修好。黄大妈道：“这么多年都过去了，忽然这么忙！黑更半夜的，跌倒碰倒多不好。”黄大爹道：“现在大跃进，一天当二十年，过一夜就是十年。人家连夜赶做车子，你不连夜把路修好，明天还让新车子走这种滥路呀？”黄大妈没话说了，长寿长生两个青年人自然更不会反对。接着，黄大爹又说：“这修的是社会主义的路，不只路面要平，还要路基牢，靠山沟常被山水冲的那面要砌石头。”黄大妈担心时间来不及，长寿长生两个像牛一样壮的后生说：“来得及的，路又不长。要修就修好嘛！”
    一家四口立刻动手。石头不够，把楼廊下的础石也移去了几块。工作中，黄大爹赶着两个儿子，黄大妈赶黄大爹，全都不息不停，暗中较劲。火把熄了又燃，灯油干了又添，四人手脚不停地忙到天明，终于把路修好了。
    望着这又平又宽的崭新道路，黄大妈笑了。转面看见长生额角上的伤疤，又感慨地道：“要是早些年你爹也像现在这样起劲，早把路修好，你也不会一辈子带上这个记号了！”黄大爹笑道：“早些年，早些年是什么世界？我们都没有路走，哪还有心思修路？如今，我们走的是光明大道，也得让车子走一条又平又宽的新路呀。看！我们的车子来了！”
    这时，太阳刚刚染红了石山尖，晨光中，一长列新木车，吱吱吜吜地顺着广阔的道路推过来。
    注：“洋马儿”即脚踏车。
