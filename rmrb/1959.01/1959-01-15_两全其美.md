Achieving the Best of Both Worlds

The advancement of large-scale industry in cities towards manufacturing more advanced, precise, and cutting-edge products is an inevitable trend of objective development. Simultaneously, the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, particularly after the establishment of people's communes, has significantly increased the demand for means of livelihood and means of production. The goods originally produced by large factories concentrated in cities can no longer meet the needs, either in variety or quantity. Faced with this objective situation, an urgent question has been posed to the leaders of large-scale urban industries: How should we balance increasing production and improving quality?

Some factory leaders are troubled by this issue. They say: Our existing tasks have already overwhelmed us; improving quality is simply "too much to handle, beyond our capabilities." Now, the comrades at the Nanjing Radio Factory have found a good way to achieve the best of both worlds. They deeply understand that "taking care of oneself" will always leave one "unable to handle" things. The more one feels unable to cope, the more one should try to break out of the original circle, extend a hand, and enthusiastically help more units to jointly complete the tasks. This may seem difficult in the short term, but before long, they can share the pressure on themselves, allowing themselves to be in a relaxed mood to free up energy to consider the issue of improvement.

Factories that have felt the same troubles as the Nanjing Radio Factory may as well try the new path they have taken.

    两全其美
    城市的大工业向制造更高级、精密、尖端产品的方向前进，这是客观形势发展的必然趋势。同时，全国工农业生产大跃进，特别是人民公社成立以后，对生活资料和生产资料的需要量大大增加，原来集中在城市的大工厂生产的东西，无论在品种上和数量上都不能满足需要。在这个客观形势面前，就向城市大工业的领导者们提出了一个迫切的问题，应该怎样兼顾增产和提高？
    在这个问题上，有些厂的领导同志是有苦恼的。他们说：我们现有的任务已经压得喘不过气来，要提高实在是“自顾不暇，力不从心”。现在，南京无线电厂的同志找到了一条两全其美的好办法。他们深切地了解到：“自顾”就永远“不暇”，越是觉得自己顾不了的时候，就越是要设法跳出原来的圈子，把手伸出去，热情地帮助更多的单位共同来完成任务。这样做暂时看起来很费劲；但要不了多少时候，他们就可以分担自己身上的压力，使自己能心情舒畅地腾出精力来考虑提高的问题。
    同南京无线电厂感到过同样苦脑的工厂，无妨也来试验一下他们走出的这条新路。
