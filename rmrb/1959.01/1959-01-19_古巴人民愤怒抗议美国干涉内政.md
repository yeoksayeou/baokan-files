Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th: The Cuban people continue to angrily protest against the U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs and condemn the propaganda campaign launched by U.S. reactionary groups to protect the bloody executioners who ran rampant under the Batista regime.

It is reported that mass rallies against U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs were held in various squares and parks in Havana on the 17th. The slogans of the rallies were: "Yankees, don't interfere in our internal affairs!" "Punish the war criminals and executioners!"

Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro delivered a speech at a mass rally attended by ten thousand workers and students. He said that Cuba could no longer tolerate any interference or autocracy in its internal affairs, no matter where this interference and autocracy came from. Castro said that if the United States disregards our warnings and attempts to invade Cuba, then they will be resolutely resisted by the six million people of Cuba. Castro also called on all Cuban people to intensify their struggle and demand that the United States immediately extradite all the war criminals—Batista's servants—hiding in the United States so that they can be convicted according to their crimes.

On the same day, Cuban President Urrutia also condemned the U.S. attempt to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and the current hostile activities against the Cuban people in a televised speech. Urrutia said that people in the United States who sympathize with the overthrown Batista regime are spreading rumors about "large-scale judgments" in an attempt to arouse the hatred of the American people against the Cuban people. He hoped that the American people would not be fooled.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: TASS, New York, 18th: American newspapers, under the orders of domestic reactionary groups, have stirred up rumors and slander campaigns against the Cuban uprising movement and the leaders of the new government. But now they have to admit that the result of this practice has made the Cuban people even more closely united around their own government.

"New York Times" reporter Matthews wrote that it must be taken into account that accusing the leaders of the uprising movement is also accusing all Cubans, because the people support the measures of their government.

In a statement, Cuban President Urrutia reminded the United States that the insurgents had notified the United States more than once about Batista's accomplices shooting and torturing peaceful residents. He said that the United States had not responded to this. He emphasized that the Cuban government will severely punish those who have committed crimes against the people.

Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro once again condemned U.S. interference in Cuba's internal affairs in a television speech yesterday, and pointed out the legitimacy of the government's measures to punish criminals. Castro advised the United States not to forget that the weapons he provided for "defending the hemisphere" were used by Batista to suppress the people. He said that the people remember this.

The "New York Times" reporter reported from Havana that the Cuban government has also asked the United States to extradite Batista's criminals who are taking refuge there.

    古巴人民愤怒抗议美国干涉内政
    卡斯特罗指出古巴六百万人将坚决反击美国侵略行为
    乌鲁蒂亚谴责美国干涉行为和对古巴人民的敌视活动
    新华社18日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴人民继续愤怒地抗议美国干涉古巴内政，并且谴责美国反动集团为了保护在巴蒂斯塔政权下横行霸道的血腥刽子手而掀起的宣传运动。
    据报道，17日哈瓦那各广场和公园里都举行了反对美国干涉古巴内政的群众大会。大会的口号是：“美国佬，别干涉我们内政！”“惩办战犯和刽子手！”
    古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在一个有一万工人和学生参加的群众大会上发表了演说。他说，古巴再也不能忍受对它的内政的任何干涉和专制，不管这种干涉和专制来自何方。卡斯特罗说，如果美国不顾我们的警告，企图入侵古巴，那么他们将遭到古巴六百万人的坚决反击。卡斯特罗还号召全体古巴人民加紧斗争，要求美国立即引渡潜藏在美国的全部战犯——巴蒂斯塔的仆从，以便根据他们的罪行判罪。
    在同一天，古巴总统乌鲁蒂亚也在发表电视广播演说时谴责美国企图干涉古巴内政和目前所进行的对古巴人民的敌视活动。乌鲁蒂亚说，美国国内同情被推翻的巴蒂斯塔政权的人士造谣说什么“大规模判决”，其目的是企图激起美国人民对古巴人民的仇恨。他希望美国人民不要上当。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：美国报纸曾经奉本国反动集团之命，挑起了反对古巴起义运动和新政府领袖的造谣和诽谤宣传。但是现在它们不得不承认，这种做法的结果反而使得古巴人民更加紧密地团结在他们自己政府的周围。
    “纽约时报”记者马修斯写道，不能不考虑到，指责起义运动领袖也就是指责全体古巴人，因为人民拥护他们政府的措施。
    古巴总统乌鲁蒂亚在一项声明中提醒美国说，起义者曾经不只一次地把巴蒂斯塔走卒枪杀和拷打和平居民的事情通知给美国，他说，但是美国对此毫无反应。他强调指出，古巴政府将严厉惩罚那些犯有反人民罪行的人。
    古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗昨天在电视演说中，再一次谴责美国干涉古巴内政，并且指出政府所采取的惩办罪犯的措施的合法性。卡斯特罗劝美国不要忘记，他所提供的“保卫半球”的武器曾被巴蒂斯塔用来镇压人民。他说，人民是记住这一点的。
      “纽约时报”记者从哈瓦那报道说，古巴政府还要求美国引渡在那里避难的巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子。
