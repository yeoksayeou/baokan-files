What kind of cadres do the people really like? More specifically, what kind of work style do the people like, and what kind of attitude do they want cadres to have towards them? What kind of cadres have more prestige among the people, are loved by the masses, and therefore find it easier to work and achieve better results? For the vast majority of our party and state cadres, this question has long been resolved; but for a few cadres, it has not been resolved, or not resolved well.

Under the long-term education of the Party, the vast majority of cadres have close ties with the masses, place themselves among the masses, on an equal footing, treat them like family, and mingle with them. They are familiar with and care about the production, life, and ideological situation of the masses. The masses praise such cadres for not putting on airs, and do not regard them as officials, but as their own family members, calling them by their first names, Old Zhang, Old Wang, and talking about everything. When the masses have difficulties or do not understand something, they are always willing to consult with them and ask for clarification. They are also willing to tell them about their unhappiness. In this situation, cadres have a better understanding of the masses. When cadres speak, they speak to the hearts of the masses, and the masses are particularly fond of listening. During the revolutionary war, our cadres had such a relationship with the masses. After liberation, this intimate relationship of mutual trust between the Party and the masses has been further promoted and developed. In particular, in the past year or two, after the rectification movement from 1957 to 1958, opposing the "three winds and five airs," and in accordance with the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further adjusted; a large number of cadres have been sent to lower levels, and a system of cadres participating in labor has been established, with the vast majority of cadres eating, living, and working with the masses; factories have generally implemented "two participations and one reform" (cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and reforming rules and regulations); at the same time, among the masses, big contending, big blooming, big-character posters, and great debates have gradually become a habit and a regular democratic system. The masses can freely express their opinions on the work style of cadres, etc., at any time in the form of big-character posters. All of these have further developed the Party's mass line work style and further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Cadres appear among the masses as ordinary laborers, working hard and practically with the masses, and the enthusiasm of the masses is even greater, with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. This is one of the most important reasons for the comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction in 1958, and also one of the most valuable experiences.

The above situation is the mainstream of the cadre's work style and the relationship between cadres and the masses. This achievement should be cherished. However, there are also a few cadres who either rarely contact the masses, or when they do contact the masses, put themselves in a very high position and are unwilling to stand on an equal footing with the masses to discuss matters with them. Only their words count, and they do not listen to the words of the masses. They are only willing to appear as superiors of the masses, and are unwilling to appear as ordinary laborers. In their view, only by putting on an official air in front of the masses will they be respected by the masses.

What is the result? Just the opposite. The masses either keep a respectful distance from such cadres, or superficially respect them, uttering a few official platitudes when they meet them, but are dissatisfied in their hearts and unwilling to talk to them. Although such cadres also want to serve the masses and want to serve them well, it is difficult to do a good job because they cannot truly understand the feelings of the masses. Although this is only a problem of one finger or even less than one finger, it must be taken seriously.

Whether cadres can appear as ordinary laborers and treat the people equally is a question of how to understand the role of the people and how to understand the role of individual cadres. We Marxists believe that the people are the masters of history and the creators of all material and spiritual wealth. The comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction and the victory of the people's commune movement in 1958 have more eloquently proved this truth. We have seen that, due to the great development of the Party's mass line work style and the full mobilization of the enthusiasm of the people, mass movements have been carried out in various tasks, the broad masses have liberated their minds, boosted their revolutionary enthusiasm, overcome numerous difficulties, and created many amazing miracles. Which of these miracles were not created by the hands of the masses under the leadership of the Party? And which of them were foreseen by cadres who looked down on the masses? In the face of these facts, some people may ask, can the masses create miracles without the leadership of cadres? Yes, the role and achievements of cadre leadership cannot be denied. However, the reason why cadre leadership is successful is still inseparable from the mass line working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Without going to the masses to absorb wisdom and sum up experience, and without first learning from the masses, there will be no correct leadership by relying solely on a few cadres sitting in their houses and daydreaming. The cleverness of cadres is precisely due to the concentration of the cleverness of the masses, and the experience of cadres is precisely due to the concentration of the experience of the masses. Whoever is willing to go deep into the masses as an ordinary laborer and honestly act as a primary school student in front of the masses, and absorbs more from the masses, will have more brilliant leadership. Whoever puts on airs in front of the masses and thinks that he is superior to the masses will become more stupid.

Whether or not one can treat the people equally is an important measure of our cadres. Our cadres are fundamentally different from the officials of bourgeois society. According to the understanding of bourgeois rights, cadres are cadres and the masses are the masses, and they must be clearly distinguished; what would it be like if cadres were also like ordinary laborers? Cadres are officials and the masses are commoners, and officials are in charge of commoners. What kind of system would it be if cadres and the masses were on an equal footing? Since they are cadres, they must maintain a certain degree of authority, so that the masses will be obedient; what if they are casual and the masses do not listen? These are all reflections of bourgeois rights ideology. We must thoroughly eliminate bourgeois rights ideology, especially the "three winds and five airs," the paternalistic attitude, etc., in the relationship between cadres and the masses. We believe that there is a certain distinction between cadres and the masses, but this is definitely different from the relationship between officials and commoners in the old society. Our cadres are selected from the masses, grow up in mass movements, and cannot be separated from the masses for a moment. Cadres must lead the masses, but they must also accept the supervision of the masses. Cadres must be teachers of the masses, but they must first be students of the masses. Cadres and the masses stand on the same position and strive for a common goal. The prestige of cadres among the masses relies on correctly implementing the Party's policies, doing good deeds for the masses, and maintaining close contact with the masses, rather than relying on coercion and orders. Therefore, cadres and the masses are equal. The officials and commoners of the old society were the relationship between the exploiting class and the exploited class, the oppressors and the oppressed, standing on mutually hostile positions, and there was no equality at all. In the old society, the fate of the working people was not in their own hands, but was controlled by the reactionary ruling class and the exploiting class that owned the means of production. A little carelessness could lead to disaster and ruin. Therefore, the working people had no choice but to say yes to those officials on the surface. In secret, the working people organized activities such as resisting taxes and rents. This is the true attitude of the working people, and this is the essence of the relationship between the working people and the exploiting class. From this, we can see how much we should despise the attitude of the exploiting class towards the people and resolutely eliminate its influence!

The relationship between cadres and the masses is also the relationship between leaders and the masses. The relationship between people in socialist labor and other common activities also manifests itself in some aspects as the relationship between production relations and productive forces. Our task is to constantly change or adjust production relations to adapt to the continuous development of productive forces, so as to accelerate our construction. The old foundation of production relations—the private ownership of the means of production—has changed, which is a revolution. This revolution has greatly liberated productive forces and promoted the development of production and construction. With the change in the ownership of the means of production, and after the rectification movement, the relationship between people in production relations, including the relationship between leaders and the masses, as mentioned earlier, has also been greatly improved, which has further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses, and thus there has been an unprecedented situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, greatly accelerating socialist construction. Some cadres have a bad work style, like the situations mentioned earlier, putting on airs in front of the masses and lacking the mass line work style, thus hindering the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses, which should be regarded as a constraint on productive forces. Advocating that cadres treat people equally and appear as ordinary laborers is an extremely important task for further adjusting and improving the relationship between leaders and the masses, further liberating productive forces, further promoting the development of productive forces, and better promoting socialist construction.

    要平等待人
    杜敬
    人民群众究竟喜欢什么样的干部呢？更具体一点说，人民群众究竟喜欢具有什么样的作风，用什么样的态度对待他们的干部呢？什么样的干部在人民群众中比较有威信，受到群众的爱戴，因而工作起来方便，工作的效果也比较好呢？这个问题，对我们党和国家的绝大多数干部说来，早已解决；而对少数干部说来，却还没有解决，或者解决得不好。
    绝大多数干部，在党的长期教导下，同群众的关系很密切，把自己放在群众之中，放在平等的地位，与群众平起平坐，亲如一家，打成一片，对群众的生产、生活、思想情况很熟悉，也很关心。对于这样的干部，群众称赞他们没有架子，不把他们当作什么官看待，而是看作自己一家人，见面之后，老张老王，呼名唤姓，无话不说。群众有什么作难的事情，或者不明白的事情，总愿意找他们商量商量，问个明白。心里有什么不痛快，也愿意对他们诉说诉说。在这种情况下，干部对群众就更加了解了。干部一说话就说到群众的心坎里，群众也格外爱听。在革命战争期间我们的干部同群众就是这样的关系。解放以后，党同群众的这种水乳交融、互相信赖的亲密关系，进一步得到了发扬光大。特别是近一两年来，经过1957年到1958年的整风运动，反对了三风五气，根据党中央和毛泽东同志提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，进一步调整了干部同群众的关系；大批干部下放，又规定了干部参加劳动的制度，广大干部与群众同吃同住同劳动；工厂则普遍实行了“两参一改”（干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，改革规章制度）；同时，在群众当中，大鸣大放大字报大辩论，已经逐步形成习惯，逐步形成一种经常的民主制度，群众对于干部作风等等方面的意见，可以随时用大字报的形式自由地表达出来。所有这些，都使党的群众路线的工作作风得到了进一步发展，使干部同群众的关系进一步密切了。干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众之中，同群众一起苦干实干，群众的干劲也就更大了，革命积极性空前高涨。这是1958年取得社会主义建设全面大跃进的极为重要的原因之一，也是极为宝贵的经验之一。
    上述情况，是干部作风，干部同群众的关系的主流。应该十分珍视这方面的成就。但是，也有少数干部，或者很少同群众接触，或者在接触群众的时候，把自己的地位摆得很高，而不愿同群众站在平等的地位，有事同群众商量。只有他们说了话才算数，群众的话，他们听不进耳朵里去。他们只愿意以群众的上司的姿态出现，而不愿意以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。在他们看来，只有在群众面前摆出一副官架子，才会为群众所尊重。
    结果怎样呢？恰恰相反。群众对这样的干部，或者敬而远之，或者表面上很尊重他，遇事打上几句官腔，内心里却不满意，有话也不愿对他说。这样的干部，虽然也想为群众服务，并想服务得好一些，但由于不能真正了解群众的心情，工作就很难作得好。这虽然只是一个指头甚至还不到一个指头的问题，也必须引起重视。
    干部能不能以普通劳动者的姿态出现，能不能以平等的态度对待人民群众，这是一个怎样认识人民群众的作用和怎样认识干部个人作用的问题。我们马克思主义者认为，人民群众是历史的主人，是一切物质财富和精神财富的创造者。在1958年的社会主义建设全面大跃进和人民公社化运动的胜利当中，更加雄辩地证明了这一真理。我们看到，由于党的群众路线的作风得到了大大发扬，充分调动了人民群众的积极性，在各种工作当中大搞群众运动，广大群众解放了思想，鼓足了革命干劲，征服了重重困难，创造了多少惊人的奇迹。这些奇迹，有那些不是在党的领导下，由群众的双手创造出来的呢？又有那些是瞧不起群众的干部所曾预料到的呢？在这些事实面前，也许有人提出，离开干部的领导，群众能创造出奇迹吗？是的，干部领导的作用和成绩是不能抹煞的。但是，干部的领导所以有成绩，仍然离不开从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线的工作方法。不到群众当中去吸取智慧，总结经验，不首先向群众学习，只凭少数干部坐在房子里空想，是不会有什么正确的领导的。干部的聪明，正是由于集中了群众的聪明，干部的经验，正是由于集中了群众的经验。谁肯于以普通劳动者的姿态深入到群众中去，在群众面前老老实实地甘当小学生，从群众当中吸取的东西多，谁的领导就会高明一些。谁在群众面前摆架子，自以为高出群众一头，谁就反而会变得更愚蠢。
    能不能以平等态度对待人民群众，这是衡量我们的干部的一个重要尺度。我们的干部同资产阶级社会的官有着根本的区别，按照资产阶级法权的认识，干部就是干部，群众就是群众，必须分得一清二白；如果干部也像个普通劳动者，还成什么样子？干部是官，群众是民，官是管民的，如果干部和群众平起平坐，成何体统？既是干部，就必须保持一定的威严，群众才会唯命是从；如果随随便便，群众不听话怎么办？这些，都是资产阶级法权思想的反映。对于资产阶级法权思想，特别是在干部同群众的关系上的三风五气、老爷态度等等，我们必须彻底破除。我们认为，干部和群众，是有一定的区别的，但是，这决不同于旧社会的官和民的关系。我们的干部是从群众当中选拔出来的，是在群众运动当中生长起来的，又一时一刻也不能离开群众。干部要领导群众，但又必须接受群众的监督。干部要作群众的先生，但又必须首先作群众的学生。干部和群众，是站在同一立场，为一个共同的目标而努力的。干部在群众中的威信，是依靠于正确执行党的方针政策，给群众办好事，并密切联系群众，而不是依靠强迫命令。因此，干部和群众是平等的。旧社会的官和民，则是剥削阶级同被剥削阶级、压迫者同被压迫者的关系，是站在互相敌对的立场上的，根本没有平等可言。在旧社会，劳动人民的命运并没有掌握在自己手里，而是被掌握在反动统治阶级手里，被掌握在占有生产资料的剥削阶级手里，一不小心，就可能祸从天上来，闹得家败人亡。因此，劳动人民对于那些官老爷表面上只好唯唯诺诺。劳动人民暗地里却组织什么抗捐抗税抗租的活动等等。这才是劳动人民的真实态度，这才是劳动人民同剥削阶级的关系的本质。由此看来，我们是应当如何地鄙弃剥削阶级那种对待人民群众的态度，并坚决消除它的影响呢！
    干部同群众的关系，也是领导与群众的关系，人们在社会主义的劳动中以及其它共同活动中的相互关系的问题，在某些方面也表现为生产关系与生产力的关系问题。我们的任务，是要不断地改变或调整生产关系，以适应生产力的不断发展，这样才能加速我们的建设。旧的生产关系的基础——生产资料的私人所有制改变了，这是一个革命。经过这个革命，大大解放了生产力，推动了生产建设事业的发展。随着生产资料所有制的改变，又经过整风运动，生产关系当中的人与人的关系，包括领导与群众的关系，如前所说，也有了很大的改善，这就更进一步启发了群众的积极性，因而出现了工农业生产大跃进的空前未有的局面，大大加速了社会主义建设。有些干部作风不好，像前边说的那些情况一样，在群众面前摆架子，缺乏群众路线的工作作风，因而妨碍着群众积极性的充分发挥，这应当看作是对于生产力的束缚。提倡干部以平等态度待人，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，这对进一步调整和改善领导与群众的关系，进一步解放生产力，进一步促进生产力的发展，更好地推动社会主义建设，是极为重要的任务。
