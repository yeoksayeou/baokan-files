    On the Film "Comrades in Need"
    Yi Jun
    The story of "Comrades in Need" takes place in a mountain village in Northeast China in the 1930s. The cruel rule of Japanese imperialism brought profound suffering to people of all ethnic groups, and national and class oppression made the working people live like slaves. The film writes about this quite fully. In addition, the film's structure is quite compact, the plot is vivid, and there are some commendable aspects in the artistic treatment, all of which are worth affirming.
    The film attempts to express the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people through the story of the shared hardships of Liu Jinbao, a young Han man, and Kim Young-joon, a young Korean man. But does the film accomplish this thematic intention? To answer this question, we must first understand the faces of the characters who specifically embody this friendship.
    Liu Jinbao is a poor peasant who suffers extremely cruel exploitation and oppression. At the beginning of the film, Liu Jinbao is to be conscripted as a laborer, so his father has to mortgage the land to the village head as a bribe. In order to get money to redeem the land, Liu Jinbao and Kim Young-joon have to risk their lives to dig ginseng in the mountains. They even have to give a share of the money from selling the ginseng to the village head. Even so, the traitorous landlords do not let him off, but add an unwarranted crime to his name and arrest him.
    What attitude does Liu Jinbao take towards all this? Acceptance of adversity. He gives gifts, pleads guilty and begs for mercy… Rescuing Shun-nv can be considered his bravest act of resistance, but immediately after, he apologizes to the petty Japanese officer and obediently takes a beating, neither daring to defend himself nor daring to fight back. When he is injured and lying in bed, he can actually put aside this embarrassing insult and talk to Hui-suk about marriage, reveling in that pitiful, illusory little world.
    He is indifferent to the ravages of Japanese imperialism on his motherland. The Japanese Rising Sun flag flying over the land of the motherland when he enters the mountain valley, the Japanese army practicing stabbing straw men to improve their killing techniques, none of this aroused the slightest resentment or hatred in him. When he encounters the anti-Japanese guerrillas and finds an old acquaintance of his father in the guerrillas, he is equally indifferent. When the Japanese army pursues the guerrillas, he is only concerned about the safety of himself and his friends, and the fate of the guerrillas who are struggling to liberate the people of Northeast China seems to be completely irrelevant to him.
    In short, the persecution he suffers and the heroic struggles of the guerrillas he witnesses do not ignite a spark of patriotism and class consciousness in his heart. Although Liu Jinbao later risks his life to rescue Kim Young-joon from the village head's house, adding a bit of brilliance to the character, on the whole, he gives the impression of being timid, weak, and humble.
    The other of the two friends, the Korean youth Kim Young-joon, is not much better than Liu Jinbao. He goes to the mountains to dig ginseng in order to get money to marry Shun-nv. When he encounters the Japanese army and the guerrillas, his attitude is similar to that of Liu Jinbao. It is worth mentioning that: the Japanese army injured him, and the guerrillas took him in and cared for him while he recovered; he had relatively long-term contact with the guerrillas; however, when he reappears on the screen, his ideological outlook has not changed much, and he is still only concerned about his lover, family, and friends. He finally goes up the mountain to find the guerrillas, but the ideological basis of this action is mainly not due to strong patriotic ideas, but because only by taking this path can he survive and be united with Shun-nv. The colonial pain suffered by the Korean people is even more profound than that suffered by the Han people, yet Kim Young-joon is so lacking in nationalism and patriotic sentiments!
    Obviously, these two main characters are people with serious shortcomings, but the film takes a sympathetic, affirmative, and even praising attitude, which is inappropriate.
    "Comrades in Need" tries its best to portray the friendship between these two people as pure and selfless: when the two friends get lost in the forest and are threatened by death, Liu Jinbao quietly stuffs his dry food to Kim Young-joon, ready to sacrifice himself so that his friend can go back alive. When encountering the Japanese army searching the mountains, Kim Young-joon would rather risk himself to lure the Japanese army in another direction than let Liu Jinbao be discovered. After Kim Young-joon returns from the mountains, he steps forward and rescues Liu Jinbao from the village head's house, but he himself is imprisoned by the village head...
    Friendship is a relationship between people, and friendship does not exist apart from specific people. It is impossible for noble and advanced friendship to grow between cowardly and backward people like Liu Jinbao and Kim Young-joon. Although "Comrades in Need" tries to give this kind of friendship a pure and selfless nature, it is actually insignificant. The two friends sacrifice for each other, but only for the benefit of the friend; this kind of friendship is nothing more than a feudal "sense of loyalty." Especially in that era when the country and the nation were in dire straits, being able to sacrifice for a friend while ignoring the fate of the country and the nation makes this friendship based on personal grievances even more insignificant and meaningless.
    At the end of the film, Liu Jinbao rescues Kim Young-joon from the village head's house, attracting the enemy to his side, and letting Kim Young-joon and Shun-nv join the guerrillas. Undoubtedly, this gives this friendship a certain meaning, but it does not fundamentally change the nature of this friendship. If Kim Young-joon had not joined the guerrillas, Liu Jinbao would still have saved him; if it was not Kim Young-joon who was imprisoned, but another guerrilla, would Liu Jinbao have rescued him? From the logic of the film, it is likely that he would not.
    Singing the praises of friendship and unity between nationalities is a theme that should be expressed in literature and art today and in the future. But what we should praise is the friendship formed by people of all ethnic groups in the struggle against common enemies, the friendship formed in the common labor of building our great socialist motherland, and the friendship based on lofty common ideals. The film merely uses the combination of Liu Jinbao and Kim Young-joon's personal interests to express the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, which only distorts and vulgarizes this noble national friendship.

    评影片“患难之交”
    艺军
    “患难之交”的故事发生在三十年代东北的一个山村里。日本帝国主义的残酷统治给各族人民带来了深重的苦难，民族压迫和阶级压迫使得劳动人民过着奴隶般的生活。关于这一些，影片是写得比较充分的。此外，影片的结构相当紧凑，情节还生动，在艺术处理上也有些可取之处，这都是值得肯定的。
    影片企图通过汉族青年刘金保和朝鲜青年金永俊患难相共的故事，表现中朝人民之间的友谊。但是影片是否完成了这样的主题意图呢？要解答这个问题，先得弄清具体体现这种友谊的人物的面貌。
    刘金保是一个贫苦的农民，他所遭受的剥削和压迫是极其残酷的。影片的开始，刘金保要被征去当劳工，他父亲只好把田地抵押了给屯长送礼。为了弄到一笔钱赎回田地，刘金保不得不和金永俊冒着生命危险到山上去挖人参。卖参的钱还得送一份给屯长。就这样，汉奸地主们还不罢休，还得给他加上个莫须有的罪名把他抓走。
    刘金保对待这一切采取什么态度呢？逆来顺受。他送礼、赔罪哀告，……解救顺女，算是一次最勇敢的反抗行为，可是紧接着就向小棒子赔礼致歉，并老老实实地挨上小棒子的一顿拳脚，既不敢申辩一声，也不敢还手。被打伤了躺在床上时，他居然能把这种难堪的侮辱置之脑后，与惠淑说起婚嫁的事情来，陶醉在那个可怜的幻想的小天地里。
    日本帝国主义对祖国的蹂躏他是无动于衷的。在进山沟时，祖国土地上飘扬着的日本膏药旗，为了提高杀人的技术对着草人练习劈刺的日本军队，都没有激起他丝毫的愤懑和仇恨。当他碰到抗日游击队并在游击队里发现父亲的老相识时，也同样的无动于衷。日本军队追击游击队时，他关心的只是自己和朋友的安全，至于那些为解放东北人民而艰苦奋斗的游击队的命运，似乎与他完全无关。
    总之，他所身受的迫害、他所眼见的游击队的英勇斗争，没有在他的心灵里燃起一点爱国主义和阶级意识的火苗。尽管刘金保后来冒险从屯长家救出金永俊，给人物性格上添了一点光彩，但整个说来，他给人的印象却是怯懦的、软弱的、卑微的。
    两个朋友中的另一个，朝鲜族青年金永俊也不比刘金保高明多少。他上山去挖参，是为了弄一笔钱娶顺女当媳妇。他碰到日本军队和游击队时，与刘金保的态度也差不多。值得特别提到的是：日军打伤了他，游击队把他收留下来给他养伤，他直接受到游击队的帮助照顾，与游击队较长期地相处；但是，当他重新在银幕上出现时，思想面貌并没有什么改变，他关心的还只是爱人、家庭和朋友。他最后总算上山找游击队了，但这个行动的思想基础主要的不是由于强烈的爱国主义思想，而是由于只有走这条路他才能生存下去，才能与顺女结合。朝鲜族人民遭受的殖民主义的痛苦比汉族人民更为深重，金永俊却如此缺乏民族主义和爱国主义思想感情！
    显然，这两个主要人物都是有严重缺点的人，然而影片却采取同情的、肯定的、甚至歌颂的态度，这是不妥当的。
    “患难之交”中尽力把这两人之间的友谊渲染得纯洁无私：两个朋友在森林中迷了路，遭到死亡的威胁，刘金保把自己的干粮悄悄塞给金永俊，准备牺牲自己让朋友能活着回去。碰到日军搜山时，金永俊却宁愿自己冒危险把日军引到另一个方向，也不愿刘金保被发现。金永俊从山上回来后，挺身而出到屯长家救回刘金保，自己却被屯长关起来……
    友谊是一种人与人之间的关系，离开了具体的人友谊是不存在的。要让刘金保、金永俊这样怯懦、落后的人们之间，成长出高尚的先进的友谊是不可能的。尽管“患难之交”力图赋予这种友谊以纯洁、无私的性质，但是它实际上还是渺小的。两个朋友彼此为对方作出牺牲，不过是为了朋友的利益；这种友谊不过是一种带有封建气味的“讲义气”而已。尤其在国家民族处于水深火热的那个年代，能够为朋友牺牲，而对国家民族的命运置若罔闻，这种结合在个人恩怨上的友谊，更显得渺小而无意义。
    在影片的结尾，刘金保从屯长家救出金永俊，把敌人吸引到自己身边，让金永俊和顺女投奔游击队。无疑这样做赋予了这种友谊以一定意义，但并未能从根本上改变这种友谊的性质。如果金永俊不投奔游击队，刘金保还是会救他的；如果被关着的不是金永俊而是另一个游击队员，刘金保会不会去解救他呢？从影片的逻辑来看，很可能是不会的。
    歌颂民族之间的友谊团结，在今天和将来都是文学艺术中应该表现的主题。但我们应该歌颂的是各族人民在对共同敌人的战斗中结成的友谊，是在建设我们伟大社会主义祖国的共同劳动中结成的友谊，是有崇高的共同理想作为基础的友谊。像这部影片中仅仅以刘金保和金永俊的这种个人利益的结合来表现中、朝两族人民之间的友谊，只不过把这种崇高的民族友谊给歪曲和庸俗化了。
