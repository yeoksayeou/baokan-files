Xinhua News Agency report: Qinghai Province's people's communes are vigorously developing small-scale light industry. In the past year, the province's one hundred and ninety-one communes have established three thousand seven hundred and seventy-four small light industrial factories, with a total output value exceeding half of the entire province's light and heavy industrial output value in 1957. These commune-run small light industries encompass dozens of types, including sugar refining, papermaking, dairy products, pastries, leather, textiles, and ceramics, all produced locally based on the needs of commune members and the market.

The people's communes have demonstrated tremendous power in developing light industrial production. Many items that previously relied on supplies from other regions can now be self-produced by the communes. For example, Qinghai Province previously had no industries such as papermaking, sugar refining, or rayon production. Now, the communes have established twenty-three paper mills, twelve sugar refineries, and one hundred and twenty-two rayon factories. The products of these factories are partly supplied to the commune members themselves and partly supplied to the market as commodities. The Dongfeng Commune Sugar Refinery in the suburbs of Xining City used sugar beets grown on a trial basis by the commune last year to produce sugar. In addition to meeting the needs of the commune itself, it can also supply a portion to Xining City. Many people's communes in pastoral areas have established milk powder factories, producing milk powder, butter, cheese, etc. Now, residents in agricultural areas can also eat dairy products.

In summarizing last year's production, many people's communes in Qinghai believe that the potential for developing light industry in the people's communes is still very great, and that it should be greatly developed in the future.

    青海公社轻工业大显身手
    据新华社讯　青海省各地人民公社大办小型轻工业。全省一百九十一个公社在去年已经办起三千七百七十四个小型轻工业工厂，生产总值比1957年全省轻重工业总产值的一半还多。这些社办的小型轻工业有制糖、造纸、奶品、糕点、皮革、纺织、陶瓷等几十种，都是根据社员和市场的需要，就地取材生产的。
    人民公社在发展轻工业生产方面显示了巨大的威力。许多在以前要依靠外地供应的东西，现在公社都已能自制。如青海省以前没有造纸、制糖、人造棉等工业，现在，公社办起的造纸厂就有二十三个，糖厂十二个，人造棉厂一百二十二个。这些工厂的产品一部分供给本社社员，一部分作为商品供应市场需要。西宁市郊东风公社制糖厂用公社去年试种的甜菜制糖，除了供应本社需要外，还可以调供西宁市一部分。牧业区的许多人民公社建立了奶粉厂，生产奶粉、奶油、干酪等，现在，农业区的居民也可以吃奶制品了。
    青海许多人民公社在总结去年的生产时，认为人民公社办轻工业的潜力还很大，今后还要大大发展。
