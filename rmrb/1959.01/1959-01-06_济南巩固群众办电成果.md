Jinan Consolidates Achievements in Mass Electricity Generation
(Our newspaper Jinan, January 5th dispatch) Jinan City's mass electricity generation has achieved remarkable results. In just over forty days, 11,384 kilowatts of electricity have been generated (including the amount saved).

Now, Jinan City is advancing at an even greater pace on the basis of the victory of mass electricity generation. To ensure the completion of the task, the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted seven specific measures:

First, vigorously launch mass movements, continue to extensively air views, contend, and debate, mobilizing all factories, government offices, schools, stores, enterprises, institutions, and streets to further find shortcuts and devise methods to solve electricity difficulties with their own strength. Second, consolidate and stabilize the power generation equipment that has already started generating electricity, enabling it to operate normally and improve its power generation capacity. Third, further exhaust all means to tap potential and generate more electricity using various methods. Fourth, vigorously manufacture indigenous power equipment and generating equipment, while actively exploring raw materials and learning technology to meet the needs of manufacturing indigenous generating equipment. Fifth, further break through technical barriers, quickly research and solve some technical problems in the manufacture of generating equipment, and come up with standardized designs for various types of indigenous generators, indigenous steam turbines, and indigenous boilers. Sixth, widely organize communist large-scale collaboration, further share resources and provide mutual support in manufacturing equipment. Seventh, launch a red flag emulation campaign for mass electricity generation, setting off a high tide of learning from advanced, catching up with advanced, and surpassing advanced in electricity generation.

    本报济南5日电　济南市全民办电，获得显著成效，四十多天的时间，已经办电一万一千三百八十四瓩（包括节约数）。
    现在济南市正在全民办电胜利的基础上，更大踏步地前进。为保证任务的完成，中共济南市委已采取七条具体措施：
    一、大搞群众运动，继续大鸣大放大辩论，发动所有工厂、机关、学校、商店、企业事业单位和街道，进一步找窍门，想办法，用自己的力量，解决用电困难；二、巩固稳定已经发出电来的发电设备，使之正常运转，提高发电能力；三、进一步千方百计挖掘潜力，用各种办法发出更多的电来；四、大造土动力设备和发电设备，同时要积极挖掘原材料和学习技术，以满足制造土发电设备的需要；五、进一步突破技术关，迅速研究解决制造发电设备的一些技术问题，搞出各种类型土发电机、土汽轮机、土锅炉的定型设计；六、广泛组织共产主义大协作，进一步互通有无，相互支援，制造设备；七、开展全民办电的红旗竞赛运动，掀起一个学先进、赶先进、超先进的办电高潮。（附图片）
