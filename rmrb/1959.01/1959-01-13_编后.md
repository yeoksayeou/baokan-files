    In winter production, sideline occupations are a production activity with a relatively large number of participants and the widest range of avenues. Today, we are reporting on sideline production in a more concentrated manner, with the aim of introducing the following issues to everyone:

  I. Sideline Production
        Must be Planned

    Today, we published news on the front page about the development of sideline occupations in the Maqiu Commune of Nanchang County, Jiangxi, and various communes in Huayang County, Sichuan, and also published a short commentary. This news illustrates that the sideline production operated by the people's communes, like the operation of industry and agriculture, must be planned and should be incorporated into the national plan and be subject to national management. This is an important principle. The practice of these communes shows that, in accordance with the national plan, the supply of non-staple foods to the cities is guaranteed first, and the communes have an understanding of market needs, product varieties, and quantities, so that production and sales are combined, avoiding blind production. Secondly, as the communes strengthened the planning of sideline production, they also appropriately met the needs of commune members for non-staple foods, improving the lives of commune members.

  II. Facts are Most Convincing

    In the development of sideline production (including forestry, fishery, and other production), some areas still have considerable ideological obstacles. For example, some people believe that sideline occupations can be carried out in mountainous areas, but there is nothing to do in plain areas. The Xinle County Party Committee in Hebei consciously selected a point in mountainous, hilly, and plain areas to create three examples: mountainous areas have abundant grass, minerals, and medicinal materials, so they can engage in large-scale mining, medicinal herb collection, fish farming, and grazing; hilly areas have many slopes and abundant grass, so they can raise a large number of livestock; plain areas have abundant sandy wasteland and scattered land, so they can raise a large number of chickens and pigs. The broad masses of cadres saw the direction of their efforts from these experiences and strengthened their confidence. As a result, the entire county carried out a variety of production activities in accordance with local conditions and achieved great results. This is specific leadership for specific problems and is worthy of attention.

    在冬季生产中，副业是一项参加人数比较多，门路最广的生产活动。今天我们把副业生产作了较集中的报道，目的是向大家介绍这样几个问题：
  一、副业生产
        要有计划
    今天我们在头条地位刊登了江西南昌县麻丘公社和四川华阳县各个公社发展副业的消息，并且发表了短评。这个消息说明：人民公社经营的副业生产，像经营工农业一样，都必须有计划，并且应当纳入国家的计划，服从国家的管理。这是一个重要原则。这些公社的实践表明，按照国家计划，首先就保证了城市的副食品供应，并且使公社对于市场的需要、产品的品种和数量都有个了解，使产销结合起来，避免了盲目生产。其次，由于公社加强了副业生产的计划，也适当满足了社员的副食品需要，使社员生活得到改善。
  二、事实最有说服力
    在发展副业生产（当然也包括林业、渔业等生产）中，有些地区也还有不少思想障碍。比如说，有人认为山区可以搞副业，平原地区就没有什么可搞。河北新乐县委有意识地在山区、丘陵、平原各选择一个点，搞出三个榜样：山区草多矿多药材多，就大量开矿、采药、养鱼、放牧；丘陵区坡多草多，就大量饲养家畜；平原区沙荒多、零散地多，就大量养鸡养猪。广大干部从这些经验看清了努力方向，都增强了信心。于是，全县因地制宜开展了多项生产活动，取得了很大成绩。这是对具体问题进行具体领导，很值得注意。
