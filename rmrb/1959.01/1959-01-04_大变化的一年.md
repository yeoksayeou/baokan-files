A Year of Great Change
Ni Jingde, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC

Qinghai has undergone profound changes in all aspects during the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past year. In the past, many places in Qinghai Province were industrial blank spots. Now, from Xining to the Qaidam Basin, from agricultural areas to pastoral areas, factories and mines are blooming everywhere. Driven by the policy of taking steel as the key link, Qinghai, a province that did not produce an inch of iron in 1957, has not only produced its own steel, iron, and copper within a year, but also has its own machinery manufacturing industry, manufacturing metallurgy, power equipment, and precision machine tools. The coal industry has also made tremendous progress, with only a dozen coal mines the year before last and more than 400 last year. After a year of geological work by the whole party and the whole people, it has further proved that Qinghai is full of treasures - every county has iron mines and every county has coal mines. A total of more than 80 kinds of minerals and 1,137 mineral locations have been found in the province. Exciting good news came from the Qaidam Basin. After a year of drilling, several large oil fields with great industrial value have been found. Agriculture also reported frequently, with the total grain output in 1958 doubling that of 1957, and a national record of more than 8,500 jin per mu of spring wheat. As a pioneer of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the transportation industry is also developing rapidly. On several main highways such as Lanqing, Qinghai-Tibet, Chamang, and Ningzhang, heavy-duty trucks are coming and going, fully loaded. The phenomenon that Qinghai Province only transported in and not out has become a thing of the past, and the gratifying phenomenon of more out than in and insufficient outward transportation capacity has emerged. Taking the Qaidam Basin as an example, due to the large-scale mining and production of lead-zinc, borax, salt, and potash fertilizer, there is a feeling of insufficient transportation capacity. At present, there are still 60,000 to 70,000 tons of goods accumulated in the Qaidam Basin that cannot be transported out.

With the great development of economic construction, the development of cultural and educational undertakings has also ushered in a new upsurge. The number of schools at all levels and types has increased five times compared with 1957, and the number of students has increased two and a half times. Due to the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, the quality of teaching has been unprecedentedly improved.

What is particularly gratifying is that the socialist transformation of the vast pastoral areas has achieved a basic victory. Qinghai's pastoral areas had not undergone systematic economic reforms in the past. Since the liberation in 1949, party organizations at all levels have carried out eight years of arduous work in the pastoral areas, and the socialist consciousness of the vast number of working herdsmen has been greatly improved. On this basis, in the socialist revolution in 1958, the task of the democratic revolution was also thoroughly completed. Immediately afterwards, the people's commune system was realized, liberating the productive forces of the pastoral areas, and making the various construction undertakings in the pastoral areas quickly usher in a new atmosphere of comprehensive leap forward.

The past year was an extraordinary year, a great year. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are full of energy and continuing to leap forward along the victorious road of 1958, striving for a greater comprehensive leap forward in the new year.

The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 was the result of the whole people's rectification movement, the victory of the party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the victory of the Marxist-Leninist thought of continuous revolution over conservative and superstitious ideas. Over the past year, on the basis of the victory of the whole people's rectification movement, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the central government, has led all party comrades to repeatedly criticize conservative ideas, break superstitions, and eliminate various ideological obstacles on the road of the Great Leap Forward throughout the province, launch mass movements on a large scale, and constantly inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups, so that various socialist undertakings can leap forward again and again. The conservative and superstitious ideas that hinder the Great Leap Forward are first and foremost all kinds of "Qinghai backwardness" theories. For example, some comrades excessively emphasized the difficult side of the objective conditions in Qinghai, while ignoring the positive side that the poorer and whiter the masses are, the greater their enthusiasm and the more revolutionary they are. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee repeatedly criticized this wrong viewpoint. Chairman Mao taught that poverty and blankness "look like bad things, but they are actually good things. Poverty leads to change, to work, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burdens, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." Comrades working in Qinghai feel particularly close to Chairman Mao's teaching.

Another example is the issue of work in pastoral areas. After crushing the rightists' "pastoral areas do not need socialist revolution" and "pastoral areas are special" theories, we further deeply criticized some comrades for failing to see the new situation that the conditions for socialist revolution in pastoral areas have matured, and for not actively supporting the revolutionary demands of the vast number of working herdsmen; on the economic and cultural fronts, we also repeatedly criticized the wrong viewpoints of superstitious experts, not trusting the masses, sticking to old ways, and always wanting to reach out to the state when something happens, without deeply mobilizing the masses. After this series of ideological work, politics took command, and various socialist undertakings were able to make a comprehensive leap forward. Many things that everyone thought were mysterious or would take many years to accomplish in the past have now been accomplished quickly. The plans formulated by the leading organs have been repeatedly broken through by the actions of the masses in the Great Leap Forward. The situation of the Great Leap Forward has powerfully promoted the great ideological liberation of communism of the whole party and the whole people, making everyone dare to think and dare to act with greater enthusiasm.

At present, although the "Qinghai backwardness" theory has been greatly overcome, there are still remnants in the minds of a few comrades, and some comrades are satisfied with the status quo, work in a superficial manner, and are not practical enough. In order to ensure a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, we must continue to adhere to the thought of continuous revolution in the future, both to criticize various backward and conservative ideas and to encourage the vast number of cadres and the masses to have soaring enthusiasm, and to advocate a scientific analysis and a realistic work style and labor attitude, so that the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction can make a better Great Leap Forward.

    大变化的一年
    中共青海省委宣传部部长  聂景德
    青海，在过去的一年社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进中，这个地方的各个方面都发生了深刻的变化。过去，青海省有不少地方是工业的空白点。现在，从西宁到柴达木盆地，从农业区到牧业区，工厂矿山遍地开花结果。在以钢为纲的方针带动下，青海这个1957年还寸铁不产的省份，一年之间，不仅有了自己炼出的钢、铁和铜，而且有了自己的机械制造工业，制造出了冶金、动力设备和精密机床等。煤炭工业也有巨大的发展，前年只有十几个煤矿，去年则有四百多处。经过一年的全党全民办地质，更进一步证明青海遍地是宝——县县有铁矿、县县有煤矿，全省共找出了八十多个矿种，一千一百三十七个矿点。柴达木盆地传来了震奋人心的喜讯，经过一年的钻探，已找到了几个具有极大工业价值的大油田。农业同样捷报频传，粮食总产量1958年比1957年翻一番，并出现了春小麦亩产八千五百多斤的全国最高纪录。作为工农业大跃进的先行，交通运输事业，也在飞速地发展。在兰青、青藏、茶茫、宁张等几条公路干线上，络绎不绝的载重汽车，满载而去，满载而回。青海省只运进不运出的现象已成过去，而且出现了运出多运进少、向外运输能力不足的可喜现象。以柴达木盆地为例，由于铅锌、硼砂、食盐、钾肥等的大量开采和生产，就感到运输力量不足，目前柴达木盆地尚积存着六、七万吨东西运不出来。
    随着经济建设事业的大发展，文化教育事业的发展也出现了一个新的高潮。各级各类学校比1957年增加了五倍，学生增加了两倍半。由于贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，教学质量空前提高。
    特别值得庆幸的是，广大牧业区的社会主义改造取得了基本胜利。青海的牧业区以往没有进行过系统的经济改革，1949年解放以来，党的各级组织在牧业区进行了八年艰苦工作，广大劳动牧民社会主义觉悟大大提高，在这个基础上，1958年在社会主义革命中，同时也彻底地完成了民主革命的任务。紧接着，又实现了人民公社化，解放了牧业区的生产力，使牧业区的各项建设事业迅速地出现了全面跃进的新气象。
    过去的一年，是不平凡的一年，伟大的一年。现在，青海省的各族人民正干劲十足地，沿着1958年胜利的道路继续跃进，争取在新的一年里来一个更大的全面跃进。
    1958年的全面大跃进，是全民整风运动的成果，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利，是马克思列宁主义不断革命思想对保守、迷信思想斗争的胜利。一年来，在全民整风胜利的基础上，青海省委根据中央的指示，领导全党同志在全省范围内，反复地批判保守思想、破除迷信，排除大跃进道路上的各种思想障碍，大搞群众运动，不断地鼓舞各族人民的革命干劲，使各项社会主义的事业跃进再跃进。障碍大跃进的保守、迷信思想，首先是形形色色的“青海落后”论。比如，一些同志过分强调青海地区客观条件困难的一面，而忽视越穷越白群众干劲越大，越要革命的积极的一面，青海省委反复批判了这个错误观点。毛主席教导说，一穷二白“看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”在青海工作的同志，分外感到毛主席这个教导的亲切。
    再如关于牧业区的工作问题。在粉碎了右派分子所散布的“牧区不要社会主义革命”、“牧区特殊”论以后，又深入批判了一些同志看不到牧业区社会主义革命条件已经成熟的新情况，不积极支持广大劳动牧民革命要求的保守思想；在经济和文教战线上也反复批判了迷信专家、不相信群众、墨守陈规、遇事总想向国家伸手，不去深入地发动群众等错误观点。经过这一系列的思想工作以后，政治挂了帅，社会主义的各项事业才得全面跃进。好多事情过去大家认为神秘莫测或者要好多年以后才能办到，现在，很快地办到了。领导机关所订的规划，一再被群众大跃进的行动所突破。大跃进的形势，又有力地促进了全党全民的共产主义思想大解放，使大家敢想敢干鼓起更大干劲。
    目前，“青海落后”论虽然已经有了很大的克服，但是在少数同志的头脑中还有残余，也有一些同志，满足现状，工作浮夸，不够踏实。为了保证1959年更大的更全面的跃进，今后必须继续坚持不断革命思想，既要批判各种落后保守思想，鼓足广大干部和群众的冲天干劲，又要提倡科学分析和实事求是的工作作风和劳动态度，使社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业更好地大跃进。
