Coal Washing

Speaking of coal washing, some people may find it strange: coal is used for burning, so why wash it in water? In fact, coal washing is not just "washing", but also "selection" through washing, so coal washing is also called coal preparation.

The raw coal mined from underground contains impurities such as sand, clay, sulfur, and phosphorus. Washing and preparation mainly utilizes the different specific gravities of coal and these impurities. Through screening and shaking in water, the refined coal suitable for coking requirements, the secondary coal with more impurities, and the gangue are selected separately.

If the raw coal is used for coking without washing and preparation, the coke produced will not only have a high ash content, but also a high sulfur and phosphorus content. If this coke with high sulfur and phosphorus content is used for iron smelting, the pig iron produced will also have a high sulfur and phosphorus content. If this pig iron is used for castings, it is prone to brittle fracture during machining. If this pig iron is used for steelmaking, the quality of the steel produced will also be brittle. At the same time, if the ash content in the coke is too high, more coke and less ore will be loaded in the iron-smelting furnace, which will not only reduce iron production but also consume more coke. According to experiments by some steel plants, for every 1% reduction in the ash content of coke, pig iron production can be increased and coke consumption can be saved by more than 2%. Generally, using washed coal for coking results in an ash content of coke that is 10% to 20% lower than that of coke made from raw coal. Then, the amount of increased pig iron production and coke savings will be considerable.

After the raw coal is washed and prepared before coking, it can also reduce the amount of water and land transportation. Under normal circumstances, two tons of raw coal produce one ton of coking washed coal. Therefore, using washed coal for coking can save about half of the transportation volume compared to using raw coal for coking. Because of the low ash content of the coke made from washed coal, a batch of transportation capacity can also be saved.

The secondary coal picked out after washing and preparation can also be used for power generation and general industrial coal. (Attached picture)

    洗煤

    谈起洗煤，有人可能会感到奇怪：煤是用来燃烧的，为什么还要拿到水里去洗一遍呢？实际上，所谓洗煤，不只是“洗”，而且是通过洗来“选”，所以洗煤又叫作洗选。
    从地下开采出来的原煤，含有砂子、粘土、硫、磷等杂质。洗选主要是利用煤和这些杂质的比重不同，经过在水中筛选、震荡，把原煤中适合炼焦要求的精煤、含杂质较多的次煤和?石分别挑选出来。
    如果不加洗选，就把原煤拿去炼焦，炼出来的焦炭不仅灰份多，而且含硫、磷也高。拿这种含硫、磷高的焦炭去炼铁，炼出来的生铁含硫、磷也就多了。拿这种生铁来作铸件，进行机械加工时很容易脆裂。如果拿这种生铁去炼钢，炼出来的钢的质量也脆。同时，如果焦炭里的灰份太多，在炼铁炉里面就要多装焦炭少装矿石，因而既少出铁，又要多用焦炭。根据某些钢铁厂的试验，焦炭的灰份每降低1％，就可以增产生铁并节约焦炭各2％以上。一般用洗选过的煤来炼焦，焦炭的灰份比用原煤炼的要低10％到20％。那末，增产生铁和节省焦炭的数量就可观了。
    原煤经过洗选以后再炼焦，还可以减少水陆运输量。一般情况下，两吨原煤出一吨炼焦洗煤，因此，用洗煤炼焦比用原煤炼焦可以节约运输量一半左右。用洗煤炼的焦炭，由于灰份少，又可以节约一批运力。
    经过洗选挑出来的次煤也可以作发电和一般工业用煤。（附图片）
