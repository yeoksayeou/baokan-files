Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, January 25th - Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Yugoslavia, Ji Jianbo and Ding Man, submitted a written protest to the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs on the 24th, protesting the public insults against them by the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs spokesman, Konchi.

The written protest has been handed over to Rompa, First Secretary of the Press Department of the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, by the reporters in person.

On January 9th, at the weekly press conference of the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, Konchi publicly slandered Xinhua News Agency's correspondents in Yugoslavia. He insisted that the reports on Yugoslavia written by Xinhua News Agency's correspondents were "political slander." However, Konchi could not provide any facts to support his slander. He could not point out any aspect of the Xinhua News Agency reporters' reports that did not conform to the actual situation in Yugoslavia. At the press conference, he unreasonably berated the Xinhua News Agency reporters, saying that the reporters used "medieval methods," were engaged in "McCarthyism in disguise," and that it was a "result of reconnaissance," etc., and threatened to "put this on their (referring to Xinhua News Agency reporters) tab."

Konchi's actions of publicly insulting and intimidating Xinhua News Agency reporters have aroused widespread anger and dissatisfaction among foreign reporters stationed in Belgrade.

The written protest from Xinhua News Agency's correspondents in Yugoslavia stated:

"The slander against us by Mr. Konchi, the spokesperson of the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, at the press conference on January 9, 1959, is completely groundless. Their reports on the situation in Yugoslavia are completely objective and based on facts, and these materials have been publicly published in Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals. Therefore, Mr. Konchi's abuse of reporters at the press conference is not only an unprecedented and unreasonable act internationally, but also violates the dignity of the journalistic profession and constitutes a public insult to reporters. Therefore, we strongly protest against Mr. Konchi's unreasonable behavior and hope to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future."

    新华社驻南斯拉夫记者
    抗议南官员无理侮辱
    新华社贝尔格莱德25日电　新华通讯社驻南斯拉夫分社记者纪坚博和丁曼24日向南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处提出书面抗议，抗议南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人孔奇公开对他们进行侮辱。
    这份抗议书已由记者面交南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处新闻司一等秘书罗姆帕。
    1月9日，孔奇在南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处每周例行的记者招待会上，公开诬蔑新华社驻南斯拉夫记者，他硬说新华社记者编写的关于南斯拉夫的报道是“政治中伤”。但是，孔奇却拿不出任何事实来作为他这种诬蔑的根据，他说不出新华社记者的报道有哪一点是不符合南斯拉夫的真实情况的。在记者招待会上，他对新华社记者无理谩骂，说记者用的是“中世纪的方法”、是“变相的麦卡锡主义”、“侦察的结果”等，并威胁说要把这“记在他们（指新华社驻南记者）的账上”。
    孔奇这种公开侮辱和恫吓新华社记者的行为，引起了驻贝尔格莱德外国记者的普遍愤怒和不满。
    新华社驻南斯拉夫记者的书面抗议说：
    “南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人孔奇先生1959年1月9日在记者招待会上对我们的诬蔑是毫无根据的。他们对南斯拉夫情况的报道完全是客观的和有根据的，这些材料是南斯拉夫报刊公开发表过的。因此，孔奇先生在记者招待会上谩骂记者，不仅是国际上无前例的、毫无道理的行为，而且这种行为触犯了记者职业的尊严，构成了对记者的公开侮辱。为此，我们对孔奇先生的无理行为提出强硬的抗议，并希望保证今后不再发生类似的事情”。
