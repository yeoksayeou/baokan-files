Title: Not Just a Technical Problem

　　“Golden Bell” is a meaningful lyrical comedy. I am not here to fully evaluate this film, but after seeing a certain handling technique in “Golden Bell,” I am reminded of an opinion.

　　At the beginning of the film, an old shepherd is singing a lyrical song. The song is very high-pitched and has a folk song flavor, but it is sung in a Western style. The singer is an old farmer, and the song is somewhat mismatched with his age. Furthermore, judging from the actor's slow expression, he is merely going through the motions, just opening his mouth. It seems so disharmonious that the audience will immediately feel: this isn't the old man singing, it's a professional singer dubbing.

　　We have many successful examples of singers dubbing for film actors. We all remember Comrade Wang Kun's dubbing in the film "The White Haired Girl." In those films, the singing and the plot were organically harmonious, and the audience felt very natural, without any sense of stiffness.

　　The fact that the audience feels that the singing and the actor's performance are not harmonious involves technical issues, but it is not just that, because then all that is needed is for the actor to synchronize their lip movements with the singing. Nor can we demand that all the songs in the film must be sung by the actors themselves, and not allow singers to dub. But what is more important is how to make the film more perfect, and prevent the film's songs from becoming a formalistic "burden," and avoid giving people a feeling of "fakeness."

　　I think this issue should be considered from the perspective of the song's emotion and the character's position!

    不只是技术问题
    “金铃传”是部有意义的抒情喜剧片。我这里不是全面地来评价这部影片，只是看了“金铃传”里的一点处理手法，联想到一个意见。
    影片一开始，有一个老羊工在唱一支抒情歌曲，歌很高亢，也有点民歌风味，是用洋嗓子唱的，而唱歌的却是个老农民，歌声与年龄先就有点不相称了。再从那演员的慢吞吞的表情上来看，他只不过在那里作作样子，张张嘴罢了，显得那么不和谐，观众看了一下子就会感到：这不是老汉唱，是歌唱演员给配的音。
    歌唱家给电影演员配音，我们有许多成功的例子。我们都记得王昆同志在电影“白毛女”里的配音。在那些影片中，歌声与剧情有机的谐和，观众感到十分自然，一点没有生硬的感觉。
    让观众感到歌声和演员的表演不和谐，这里面有技术问题，但又不仅仅如此，因为这样只要演员随着歌声对好口型就行了；而我们也不能要求凡是影片中的插曲一定要由演员自己来唱，不让歌唱演员配音。但是更重要的在于怎样才能使影片更完美，使影片插曲不成为一种形式主义的“累赘”，不给人以“假”的感觉。
    这个问题，我以为要先从歌的感情和人物所处的地位来考虑吧！
