Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Strengthening Party leadership and launching mass movements on the financial and trade front to ensure the completion of the arduous financial and trade work tasks in 1959 is the central task of the Party's grassroots organizations in the financial and trade departments this year.

This task was put forward at the National Conference on the Work of the Party's Grassroots Organizations in Financial and Trade Departments recently convened by the Financial and Trade Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. More than 500 people participated in this meeting, including Party branch secretaries of advanced grassroots units in financial and trade departments from various regions, secretaries of people's commune Party committees in charge of financial and trade work, ministers of financial and trade departments, and responsible comrades from financial and trade departments of provincial, municipal, autonomous region Party committees, and some prefectural and county Party committees. At the meeting, more than 80 comrades made speeches or written statements, introducing the experiences of various regions in 1958 in strengthening the Party's leadership and the work of the Party's grassroots organizations in financial and trade departments, carrying out Red Flag movements, promoting the development of diverse rural economies, supporting industrial and agricultural production, organizing commodity supply, launching technological and cultural revolutions, and strengthening socialist and communist education. These speeches reflected a situation of overall leap forward that also emerged on the financial and trade work front in 1958. In this year, all financial and trade departments comprehensively fulfilled and overfulfilled the plans stipulated by the state, promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production, supported the ascendance of the three major "marshals" of grain, steel, and machinery, and basically guaranteed the supply of people's livelihood materials. At the same time, the financial and trade management system was improved, unreasonable rules and regulations were reformed, enterprise management was improved, personnel were streamlined, management costs were reduced, accumulation was increased, and huge economic results were achieved. In the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward, the work of the Party's grassroots organizations in financial and trade departments was also greatly strengthened. As of the end of June last year, there were more than 40,000 Party grassroots organizations in financial and trade departments nationwide. These grassroots organizations generally underwent rectification in the rectification campaign, and the relationship between the Party and the masses became closer, thus greatly improving the Party's combat effectiveness, which is an important guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in financial and trade work over the past year.

The meeting studied in detail the work tasks of the financial and trade front in 1959. The meeting considered that 1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard work for the people of the whole country. In this year, industrial and agricultural production will have a greater leap forward, and the people's communes will be further consolidated and improved, which will create an extremely favorable situation for financial and trade work politically and economically, and also bring arduous tasks. The meeting pointed out that the financial and trade work tasks in 1959 mainly include the following four aspects:

	1. Actively support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production centered on steel and grain, promote the complete realization of the "Ten Proposals" put forward by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, and promote the comprehensive completion of the 1959 national economic plan. This requires financial and trade departments nationwide to actively promote the production of means of production, vigorously organize the supply of means of production; actively organize national income and commune income, rationally allocate funds, promptly check the use of funds, ensure the correct use of funds, and do a good job in bank savings; and conscientiously solve the problem of supplying living materials for water conservancy construction sites, basic construction sites, and new industrial and mining areas.

	2. Promote the production of consumer goods, develop diversified economies, and ensure the supply of people's daily necessities. In terms of non-staple foods, it is necessary to closely combine with the agricultural sector to develop the production of vegetables, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, eggs, and other non-staple foods, and vigorously develop the production and supply of aquatic products, especially fish; in urban suburbs, it is necessary to continue to actively establish non-staple food production bases to realize the policy of developing suburban agricultural and sideline production to ensure the supply of urban non-staple foods. In terms of daily-use industrial products, it is necessary to cooperate with the industrial sector to vigorously develop light industry, especially the light industry of localities and people's communes, according to the possible conditions of raw material supply. In terms of local and special products, it is necessary to actively promote production and increase the supply of commodities for the domestic market and export.

	3. Continue to implement the policy of unified purchase and sale, first of all, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. On the basis of bumper harvests, under the principle of planned consumption, correctly arrange life and live well. Ensure the completion of the unified purchase tasks of grain, oil crops, cotton, and the purchase tasks of other agricultural products. Strengthen the purchase, storage, transportation, and supply of industrial and agricultural products. Rationally allocate commodities in a planned way, improve supply methods, improve service quality, and facilitate consumers. Strengthen the economic accounting of enterprises, reduce costs, reduce expenses, improve business management level, save funds, and increase accumulation.

	4. Through the work of financial and trade departments, strengthen and consolidate rural people's communes. Correctly implement the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Improving the Rural Financial and Trade Management System to Adapt to the Situation of People's Communes," and implement the method of "two relaxations, three unifications, and one package." Enrich the financial and trade institutions of the people's communes, strengthen the planning and financial management work of the rural people's communes, establish and improve the commune financial management system, establish and strengthen the economic accounting of commune enterprises; correctly organize the accumulation and distribution work of the commune, and clarify the property relationship between the state and the commune through ideological education and system management; do a good job in the commodity circulation within and outside the commune and the direct distribution of self-produced and self-used products, promote the contract system, and promote the development of commodity production in the people's communes. In cities, financial and trade departments should, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, actively participate in the comprehensive organization of the people's economic life.

The meeting particularly emphasized that the entire cadres and workers of the financial and trade departments should be fully informed of the necessity to greatly develop commodity production and commodity exchange, and to strengthen economic accounting, and to explain the role of financial and trade work in the national economy. Therefore, all cadres and workers of the financial and trade departments must exert revolutionary vigor and strive to expand commodity circulation and promote the development of commodity production.

The meeting pointed out that continuing to strengthen the work of the Party's grassroots organizations is an important guarantee for realizing the above-mentioned arduous political and economic tasks. To this end, it is necessary to further rectify, consolidate, and improve the Party's grassroots organizations, further implement the system of combining collective leadership of the Party committee with division of labor and responsibility, and give full play to the Party's leadership role. The Party's grassroots organizations in rural financial and trade departments should be adjusted when improving the rural financial and trade management system and strengthening the financial and trade institutions of the people's communes. While consolidating and improving the Party's grassroots organizations, a number of Party members should also be developed according to the policy of being active and prudent. Socialist and communist education should be strengthened within the Party and among the staff and workers, bourgeois individualism, departmentalism, and decentralism should be criticized and overcome, and the practice of hard work and thrift, diligence in running enterprises, and cherishing public property should be promoted.

The meeting pointed out that in order to better complete this year's financial and trade work tasks, it is necessary to continue to launch mass movements on the financial and trade front. First of all, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of staff and workers to carry out the Red Flag movement more extensively and deeply. The Red Flag movement in the future should develop to a wider range, not only Red Flags in business work, but also "Red Flags" in technological revolution, cultural revolution, political and ideological work, and all aspects of financial and trade work. When launching the Red Flag movement, it is necessary to pay attention to the depth and solidness of the work, and pay attention to consolidating and improving the existing Red Flag units. The meeting considered that the so-called Red Flag unit refers to an advanced banner that correctly implements the Party's line, principles, and policies, has a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and a realistic spirit, has made outstanding achievements in its work, and has been recognized by the masses through inspection and evaluation. The more the Red Flag movement is carried out, the more in-depth, meticulous, and solid the work must be. It is necessary to prevent and overcome the tendency of being satisfied with superficial, sensational, and flashy things. Secondly, it is necessary to continue to carry out technological and cultural revolutions. The focus of technological revolution in financial and trade departments should be placed on the relatively heavy physical labor of handling, loading and unloading, processing, storage, warehousing, inspection, and calculation, so that these links will gradually move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization. In terms of cultural revolution, it is necessary to run political, cultural, and technical schools and spare-time schools on a large scale, so that staff and workers with low cultural levels will be raised to the level of senior primary school and junior high school within three to five years. In order to better implement the mass line in the management system, the meeting also requested that the experiences of "two participations and one reform" and "three participations and one reform" under the leadership of the Party committee should be widely promoted in the grassroots units of financial and trade enterprises, and requested that units that have the possibility but have not done so should gradually implement it this year.

The meeting finally requested that Party leaders at all levels of financial and trade departments must pay attention to comprehensively grasping ideology, work, and life. It is necessary to rationally adjust labor organization, arrange work order, and improve work efficiency, so that work can advance rhythmically. In addition, it is also necessary to run canteens, nurseries, and breastfeeding rooms well, carry out cultural and recreational and sports activities, and often pay attention to solving the practical difficulties in the lives of staff and workers.

This meeting was held in Beijing from December 21, 1958 to January 5, 1959. During the meeting, Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, made an important report at the meeting; the heads of the financial and trade departments of the State Council also made speeches on the work of each department in 1959.

    在财贸战线上加强党的领导和大搞群众运动
    扩大商品流通　促进商品生产
    积极组织收入　合理分配资金　加强财务管理
    全国财贸部门党的基层组织工作会议提出今年任务
    新华社11日讯　在财贸战线上继续加强党的领导和大搞群众运动，以保证1959年繁重的财贸工作任务的完成，这是今年财贸部门党的基层组织的中心任务。
    这个任务是在中共中央财政贸易工作部最近召开的全国财贸部门党的基层组织工作会议上提出的。参加这次会议的有各地财贸部门先进基层单位的党支部书记、一部分人民公社党委管理财贸工作的书记、财贸部长和各省、市、自治区党委及一部分地委、县委财贸部门的负责同志共五百多人。会上，有八十多位同志作了发言或书面发言，他们介绍了1958年各地在加强财贸部门党的领导和党的基层组织工作、开展红旗运动、促进农村多种经济的发展、支援工农业生产和组织商品供应、展开技术革命和文化革命，加强社会主义和共产主义教育等方面的经验。这些发言反映了1958年在财贸工作战线上也出现了一个全面跃进的局面。这一年财贸各部门全面地完成和超额完成了国家规定的计划，促进了工农业生产的发展，支援了粮食、钢铁和机械三大“元帅”升帐，基本上保证了人民生活物资的供应。同时，改进了财贸管理体制，改革了不合理的规章制度，改善了企业的经营管理，精简了人员，降低了管理费用，增加了积累，取得了巨大的经济成果。在整风运动和大跃进中，财贸部门党的基层组织工作也大大加强了。截至去年6月底，全国财贸部门已有党的基层组织四万多个，这些基层组织在整风运动中普遍进行了整顿，党与群众的关系更加密切，因而大大地提高了党的战斗力，这是一年来财贸工作能够大跃进的重要保证。
    会议详细地研究了1959年财贸战线的工作任务。会议认为，1959年是全国人民苦战三年中具有决定意义的一年。这一年工农业生产将有更大的跃进，人民公社将进一步巩固和提高，这样就在政治上和经济上给财贸工作造成了极为有利的形势，同时也带来了繁重的任务。会议指出1959年的财贸工作任务主要有以下四个方面：
    一、积极支援以钢铁和粮食为中心的工农业生产大跃进，促进全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的“十大倡议”的完满实现，促进1959年度国民经济计划的全面完成。这就需要全国财贸部门积极地促进生产资料的生产，大力组织生产资料的供应；积极地组织国家的收入和公社的收入，合理分配资金，及时检查资金的使用情况，保证资金的正确使用，并且做好银行储蓄工作；认真地解决水利工地，基本建设工地和新工矿区的生活资料供应问题。
    二、促进生活资料的生产，发展多种经济，保证人民生活必需品的供应。在副食品方面，应当与农业部门密切结合，发展蔬菜、猪、羊、鸡、鸭、蛋品和其他副食品的生产，并大力发展水产品特别是鱼类的生产和供应；在城市郊区应当继续积极建立副食品生产基地，实现发展郊区农副业生产以保证城市副食品供应的方针。在日用工业品方面，应当根据原料供应的可能条件，与工业部门协作，大力发展轻工业，特别是地方和人民公社的轻工业。在土副产品方面，应当积极促进生产，增加国内市场和出口的商品供应。
    三、继续贯彻执行统购统销政策，首先是粮食的统购统销政策，在大丰收的基础上，在计划消费的原则下，正确地安排生活，把日子过好。保证完成粮食、油料、棉花的统购任务和其他农产品的采购任务。加强对工农业产品的收购、保管、运输和供应工作。有计划地合理分配商品，改进供应方法，提高服务质量，便利消费者。加强企业的经济核算，降低成本，减少费用，提高经营管理水平，节约资金，增加积累。
    四、通过财贸部门的工作，加强和巩固农村人民公社。正确地贯彻“中共中央和国务院关于适应人民公社化的形势改进农村财政贸易管理体制的决定”，实行“两放、三统、一包”的办法。充实人民公社的财贸机构，加强农村人民公社的计划工作和财务管理工作，建立和健全公社财务管理制度，建立和加强公社企业的经济核算；正确地组织公社的积累和分配工作，并通过思想教育和制度管理，把国家和公社的财产关系划分清楚；做好公社内部和外部的商品流通和自产自用产品的直接分配工作，推广合同制度，促进人民公社商品生产的发展。在城市中，财贸部门应当在党委的统一领导下，积极地参与全面组织人民的经济生活。
    会议特别强调，应当在财贸部门的全体干部和职工中，充分说明必须大大发展商品生产和商品交换、加强经济核算的道理，说明财政贸易工作在国民经济中的作用，因此，财贸部门的全体干部和职工必须鼓足革命干劲，为扩大商品流通和促进商品生产的发展而奋斗。
    会议指出，继续加强党的基层组织工作，是实现以上繁重的政治任务和经济任务的重要保证。为此必须进一步整顿、巩固和提高党的基层组织，进一步贯彻执行党委集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度，充分发挥党的领导作用。农村财贸部门党的基层组织，应该在改进农村财贸管理体制，加强人民公社的财贸机构时，加以调整。在巩固与提高党的基层组织的同时，还应该根据积极而慎重的方针发展一批党员。应当在党内和职工中加强社会主义和共产主义的教育，批判和克服资产阶级个人主义思想，本位主义和分散主义倾向，提倡艰苦朴素，勤俭办企业，爱护公共财产的风气。
    会议指出，为了更好地完成今年的财贸工作任务，在财贸战线上必须继续大搞群众运动。首先，要动员广大职工更广泛、更深入地开展红旗运动。今后的红旗运动应当向更广泛的方面发展，不仅要有业务工作方面的红旗，而且要有技术革命、文化革命、政治思想工作以及财贸工作各个方面的“红旗”。在展开红旗运动时，必须注意工作的深入、踏实，注意巩固和提高现有的红旗单位。会议认为，所谓红旗单位，就是指正确地贯彻了党的路线、方针和政策，具有高度的革命干劲和实事求是的精神，在工作上做出了优异的成绩，经过检查评比得到群众公认的先进旗帜。越是开展红旗运动，工作越要深入、细致、踏实，必须防止和克服那种满足于表面上轰轰烈烈华而不实的倾向。其次，要继续开展技术革命和文化革命。财贸部门技术革命的重点应当放在体力劳动比较繁重的搬运、装卸和加工、保管、仓储、检验、计算等方面，使这些环节逐步走向半机械化和机械化。在文化革命方面，要大办政治、文化、技术学校和业余学校，在三五年内使文化程度低的职工分别提高到高小和初中程度。为了在管理制度上更好地贯彻群众路线，会议还要求在财贸企业基层单位中普遍推广党委领导下的“两参一改”、“三参一改”等经验，要求在今年内凡是有可能而还没有这样做的单位，应当逐步实行。
    会议最后要求财贸部门各级党的领导必须注意全面地抓思想、抓工作、抓生活。要合理调整劳动组织、安排工作秩序、提高工作效率，使工作有节奏地前进。此外，还要办好食堂、托儿所和哺乳室，开展文化娱乐和体育活动，经常注意解决职工生活中的实际困难。
    这次会议是1958年12月21日到1959年1月5日在北京举行的。会议期间中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记李先念到会作了重要报告；国务院财贸各部的负责人也分别在会上就各部1959年的工作作了发言。
