    I am a worker at the ball bearing factory of the Weixian People's Commune in Junxian County, Henan Province.
    In the past, our factory used hand-cranked threshing machines to manufacture ball bearings. Five or six people could only crank out two to three thousand a day. The work efficiency was low, and the quality was poor. Our factory only used three steel grinding discs, which was labor-intensive and slow to produce finished products. Last September, we modified the ball bearing machine, and now we can thresh forty to fifty thousand a day. Later, with the strong support of Party committees at all levels, I also researched and made a steel ball bearing threshing machine, which is now nearing success.
    Now, I am still experimenting with making a machine that can install ten steel grinding discs. If ten steel grinding discs can be installed, the ball bearings produced will be numerous, fast, and good. If we can use power, the ball bearings will automatically roll from one disc to another, without touching the ground, and no one needs to stand beside the grinder. The Party committee attaches great importance to these experiments. Last October, the Party committee introduced me to the Xinxiang Tractor Repair and Assembly Plant and the Machine Tool Plant, and transported two tons of steel for me to conduct steel grinding experiments there. After these are successful, we will also make a power-driven ball bearing combination machine. With the foundation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have more confidence in the even greater leap forward in 1959.

    圆圆滚珠多又好
    吴清阶
    我是河南省浚县卫贤人民公社滚珠轴承厂的工人。
    我们厂过去制造滚珠，都用手摇脱粒机，五、六个人，一天才摇两三万个，工效低，质量差。我们厂只用三盘钢磨，费人手，出成品又慢。去年9月，我们改修了滚珠机，每天可以脱粒四、五万个。以后，在各级党委的大力支持下，我又研究做钢滚珠脱粒机，现在已经接近成功了。
    现在，我还在试做能安装十盘钢磨的机器，如果能安十盘钢磨，出的滚珠就又多又快又好。要能用上动力，滚珠自动从这盘磨滚到那盘磨，珠不落地，磨旁边就可以不用人守着了。这些试验，党委都很重视。去年10月，党委把我介绍到新乡拖拉机修配厂和机床厂，并运去了两吨钢，让我在那里专做钢磨试验。这些做成功后，我们还要做用动力带动的滚珠联合机。有了1958年的大跃进基础，1959年的更大跃进，我们心里更有底了。
