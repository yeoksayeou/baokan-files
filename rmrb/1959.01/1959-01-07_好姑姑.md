    Good Aunt (Nursery Rhyme)
    Sichuan Nanchong Wang Guodong Poem Zhao Ruichun Woodcut
    Little turtledove, coo-coo-coo,
    A good aunt has come to my house.
    Eating from the same pot as me,
    Living in the same room as me.
    Working in the fields during the day,
    Sweeping the floor and feeding the pigs when she gets home.
    When she has time, she teaches me culture,
    And also helps Mom make clothes.
    Mom asks her if she's tired,
    She says not tired, not tired, very happy.
    If you want to know who she is,
    She's a good cadre who has been sent to the countryside.

    好姑姑（儿歌）
    四川南充  王国东诗  赵瑞椿木刻小斑鸠，咕咕咕，我家来了个好姑姑。同我吃的一锅饭，同我住的一个屋。白天下地搞生产，回家扫地又喂猪。有空教我学文化，还帮妈妈做衣服。妈妈问她苦不苦，她说不苦不苦很幸福。要问她是哪一个，她是下放的好干部。（附图片）
