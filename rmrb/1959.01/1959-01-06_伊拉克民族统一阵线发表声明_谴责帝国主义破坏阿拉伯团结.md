Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, January 5th. The Supreme Committee of the Iraqi National United Front issued a statement on December 31st of last year, emphasizing that "the imperialists, who are opposed to Arab unity, are trying to sow seeds of discord among Arab countries in order to weaken and divide Arab solidarity, especially to undermine the unity between Iraq and the United Arab Republic."

The statement also said that the purpose of the propaganda campaign launched by the imperialists is to strike at Iraq, then at the UAR, and then to completely destroy the entire Arab unity. The statement continued: "It is no secret that Lauter's visit harbored these aims. The purpose of Lauter's visit was to create a divide between Iraq and the UAR."

The statement pointed out that the reason why imperialism is desperately trying to undermine the unity between Iraq and the UAR is: first, the Iraqi revolution has destroyed imperialism's strongest shield in the Middle East and one of the most dangerous nests of their conspiracies against the Arab people; second, Iraq and the UAR are the vanguards of the Arab people's struggle and the two major bastions of freedom.

    伊拉克民族统一阵线发表声明
    谴责帝国主义破坏阿拉伯团结
    新华社巴格达5日电　伊拉克民族统一阵线最高委员会在去年12月31日发表声明强调指出，“为阿拉伯的团结所反对的帝国主义者力图在阿拉伯国家之间散布不和的种子，以便削弱和分裂阿拉伯的团结一致，特别是想破坏伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的团结。”
    声明又说，帝国主义者所发动的宣传运动的目的，在于打击伊拉克，继而打击阿联，然后就彻底破坏整个阿拉伯的团结一致。声明接着说：“朗特里的访问就怀有这些目的，这已经不是什么秘密了。朗特里这次访问的目的是要在伊拉克和阿联之间制造鸿沟。”
    声明指出，帝国主义所以要拼命破坏伊拉克和阿联的团结，是因为：第一，伊拉克的革命摧毁了帝国主义在中东的最坚硬的盾牌和它们对付阿拉伯人的阴谋的最危险的巢穴之一；第二，伊拉克和阿联这两个共和国是阿拉伯人民斗争的先锋，是自由的两大堡垒。
