Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 16th: Mikoyan held a press conference yesterday, where he answered many questions from American and foreign journalists. Mrs. Frederick, President of the United Nations Correspondents Association, thanked Mikoyan on behalf of the association for agreeing to hold this press conference despite his busy schedule.

In answering a question about the Soviet Union's attitude towards participating in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Mikoyan said that the Soviet Union hopes that the fruits of scientific work will be enjoyed by all mankind and is willing to cooperate with the United Nations in this regard. It is beneficial for the Soviet Union to participate in the committee. However, when the committee was established on this issue, a domineering spirit, the spirit of military blocs, prevailed, and attempts were made to subordinate the Soviet Union and socialist countries. Therefore, we do not participate in this committee. I think anyone will understand that we cannot take another approach.

Someone asked Mikoyan to comment on the Algerian people's national liberation struggle. Mikoyan replied: Our position is well known. The Algerian people are waging a just war for independence and to break free from colonial oppression. The Provisional Government of Algeria reflects the aspirations of its people. We hope that the Algerian people's struggle will be victorious and believe that it would be best if the French government could find a peaceful solution and satisfy the legitimate rights of the people of this country, who are in dire straits.

An Indian journalist asked Mikoyan to comment on the arguments of some pessimists in the United States about the "inevitability" of war. Mikoyan replied: I am a very optimistic person, and I believe that humanity will not perish. If we go all out for peace, there will be peace. Of course, the threat of war is very serious. There is currently an arms race and a cold war, which could turn into a hot war at any time. Therefore, we must start by eliminating the cold war and use all measures known to mankind to create an atmosphere of complete mutual trust, or at least trust that can guarantee peaceful coexistence, if complete trust is not possible.

Differences may exist, and this is natural. Differences may exist between the people of different countries, and also within the people of one country. But the existence of differences is not the danger. The danger is that some people attempt to rely on force and impose their will on others to resolve differences, instead of seeking an acceptable basis that takes into account the interests of all parties concerned.

Our proposals and actions are to ensure genuine coexistence and prevent any increase in military danger. We encounter many difficulties, obstacles, and obstructions, but we will not give up the struggle, and we will do our best to fight for it.

Someone asked Mikoyan to estimate the prospects for reaching an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. He replied: In essence, this issue is close to being resolved. Solving this problem will be a big step forward. In the past, some people said: Supervision is impossible, the Soviet Union opposes supervision, and testing cannot be stopped without supervision. However, when our and American scientists met in Geneva last summer, these scientists concluded that existing instruments could record any nuclear explosion at a long distance.

Currently, some people want to use coercion against us again. There is such a disagreement in the current negotiations. It is said that if there is doubt about whether an explosion has occurred, the supervisory committee should decide where to conduct the investigation with a majority vote. However, since the majority of the members of the committee will inevitably be under the influence of the Americans, this issue will be resolved under the direction of the Americans, rather than through the collaboration of the major countries concerned.

We do not recognize any coercion, nor do we impose such methods on others. Therefore, if the United States insists on this position on this issue, it will be difficult to reach an agreement. Finally, we demand a permanent ban on nuclear testing. This is also the desire of people all over the world. However, our counterparts in the West suggest suspending testing for one year. But even without an agreement, testing can be suspended for one year, because it usually takes a year from one series of tests to another. We are prepared to wait for some time. I think it will be difficult for the United States to sabotage the negotiations on this issue, because public opinion is so strong that it cannot be ignored. I estimate that the United States government is unwilling to be condemned on the thorny issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing.

A female journalist from Agence France-Presse asked whether emphasizing Soviet cooperation with the United States meant that world problems should be resolved mainly by major powers rather than by the United Nations.

Mikoyan replied: We do not think so. We have not suggested that the two major powers solve problems involving other countries. We do not want to instigate the Americans to quarrel with their allies. We do not want to reach an agreement with one country at the expense of other countries. A problem may involve the people of many countries, but this fact does not preclude two countries from discussing the problem. Representatives of three countries or many countries can also discuss the problem. The important thing is that this discussion is for easing tensions, for reaching an agreement, rather than for exacerbating the Cold War.

An Associated Press reporter asked Mikoyan whether he thought the suggested conference on the Berlin issue should be at the level of foreign ministers or heads of government.

Mikoyan replied: As you all know, we have long advocated holding a high-level meeting. We still hold this attitude now. But our counterparts use various excuses to avoid this meeting: they argue about what level the meeting should be at, and they argue about the agenda. And the agenda issue has been negotiated for many years. Many years have passed, and the agenda is still unresolved.

What will happen in the future? I think others know better than we do. I don't want to predict, but I think there is no way out other than negotiation. How long can meetings and negotiations be delayed? I think the meeting will be held. When it will be held and in what form, it is difficult to say now.

In answering another question, Mikoyan emphasized that the Soviet Union's economic development plan poses no threat to the people of other countries. He said, we want to live better, and whether you like it or not, we will always live better. Therefore, let us compete. I think our achievements in improving the lives of our people will also benefit the masses of people in capitalist countries. If our lives are improved as quickly as they are now, then the workers in other countries will see what is happening. And the capitalists, in order not to lose their rule over their own countries, will also pay more attention to the workers and their demands. In this way, we will indirectly help to improve the living standards of capitalist countries. This is also not bad.

Finally, Mrs. Frederick, President of the United Nations Correspondents Association, thanked Mikoyan on behalf of all the journalists present for his detailed answers. She said, I would like to express the hope of many people: Your visit will be the beginning of a more active struggle for peace to save the next generation from the scourge of war.

In the afternoon, Mikoyan delivered a speech at a meeting of the Foreign Policy Association, which was attended by more than five hundred American social figures. The meeting did not allow reporters to interview.

Mikoyan and his entourage traveled to Washington by train last night.

### 米高扬在纽约记者招待会上说  为了保证和平必须消灭冷战  不管美国是否愿意　苏联人民生活总会更好

    米高扬在纽约记者招待会上说
    为了保证和平必须消灭冷战
    不管美国是否愿意　苏联人民生活总会更好
    据新华社16日讯　塔斯社纽约16日讯：米高扬昨天举行了记者招待会，在招待会上回答了美国记者和外国记者的许多问题。联合国记者协会主席弗雷德里克夫人代表协会感谢米高扬，感谢他在百忙中还答应举行这次记者招待会。
    在回答苏联对参加和平利用宇宙空间委员会的态度问题时，米高扬说，苏联希望科学工作的果实为全人类所享受，并且愿意在这方面同联合国进行合作。苏联参加委员会是有益的。但是当关于这个问题的委员会建立时，占支配地位的是一种蛮横精神，军事集团的精神，并且企图迫使苏联和社会主义国家处于从属地位。因此我们不参加这个委员会。我想，任何人都会明白，我们不能采取另外的做法。
    有人请米高扬谈谈对阿尔及利亚人民民族解放斗争的看法。米高扬回答说：我们的立场是尽人皆知的。阿尔及利亚人民进行着争取独立、争取摆脱殖民主义压迫的正义战争。阿尔及利亚临时政府反映本国人民的愿望。我们希望阿尔及利亚人民斗争胜利，认为最好是法国政府能够找出和平解决和满足这个处于水深火热之中的国家的人民的合法权利。
    有一个印度记者请米高扬对美国某些悲观主义者关于战争“不可避免”的论调加以评论，米高扬回答说：我是一个非常乐观的人，我认为，人类不会灭亡。如果我们为和平全力以赴，就会有和平。当然，战争的威胁是很严重的。现在正在进行军备竞赛、冷战，这种冷战随时都可能变成热战。因此必须从消灭冷战开始，并且用人类已知的一切措施来创造相互间完全信任的气氛，如果不能完全信任，那么就是能够保证和平共处的信任也好。
    分歧可能存在，这也是自然的。分歧可能存在于各国人民之间，也可能存在于一国人民的内部。但是危险的并不是分歧的存在。危险的是有人企图依靠武力和把自己的意志强加给别人来解决分歧，而不是寻求考虑到各有关方面利益的可以接受的基础。
    我们的主张和行动是要保证真正的共处，并且不许军事危险有所增加。我们碰到很多困难、障碍和阻挠，但是我们不会放弃斗争，我们将尽全力为此而斗争。
    有人请米高扬估计一下达成停止核武器试验协议的前景。他回答说：实质上这个问题差不多接近解决。解决这个问题将前进一大步。从前有人说：监督是不可能的，苏联反对监督，没有监督不能停止试验。但是，当我们的和美国的科学家去年夏天在日内瓦聚会时，这些科学家得出结论说，现有的仪器有可能在远距离记录任何核爆炸。
    目前有人又想对我们使用强迫手段。现在谈判中存在着这样的分歧。据说，如果对有没有发生爆炸产生了怀疑，那么负责监督的委员会应该在多数票赞成的情况下决定在何处进行调查。但是，由于委员会的大多数成员必然处于美国人的影响之下，因此就将在美国人指使下，而不是以各主要有关国家的协作方式来解决这种问题。
    我们不承认任何强迫手段，同时也不把这种手段强加给别人。因此，如果美国方面要在这个问题上坚持这种立场，那么将难于达成协议。最后，我们要求永远禁止核试验。全世界人民的愿望也是如此。而我们的对方西方国家却建议暂停试验一年。但是即使没有协定也是可以停止试验一年的，因为由一系列试验到另一系列试验通常都需要一年的时间。我们准备等待一些时候。我想，美国将难于破坏关于这个问题的谈判，因为舆论是如此强烈，以致不能置之不理。我估计，美国政府不愿意在停止核武器试验这个棘手的问题上受到谴责。
    法新社一个女记者问道，强调苏联同美国的合作是否意味着：世界问题主要应当由大国、而不是由联合国来解决。
    米高扬回答说：我们不这样认为。我们没有建议要两大国解决涉及到其他国家的问题。我们不想唆使美国人同它的盟国争吵。我们不希望用牺牲其他国家的办法来同一个国家达成协议。一个问题可能涉及到许多国家的人民，但是这个事实并不排斥两个国家能够讨论这个问题。三个国家或者很多的国家的代表也可以讨论这个问题。重要的是，这种讨论是为了缓和紧张局势，为了达成协议，而不是加剧冷战。
    美联社记者问米高扬：他是否认为建议召开的关于柏林问题会议应当是外交部长级的，或者是政府首脑级的。
    米高扬回答说：你们都知道，我们很早就主张举行高级会议。我们现在也还抱着这样的态度。但是我们的对方却用各种借口回避这个会议：他们一会儿争论会议应当是什么级的，一会儿争论议程问题。而且议程问题协商了好几年。好几年过去了，而议程依然没有结果。
    以后将会怎么样呢，我认为，别人比我们知道得更清楚。我不想预测，但是我认为，除了谈判之外别无出路。会晤和谈判还能拖延多久呢？我想会议将会举行。它将在什么时候和以什么形式举行，这个问题现在还很难说。
    米高扬在回答另一个问题时强调指出，苏联的经济发展计划毫不威胁其他国家人民。他说，我们想生活得更好些，不管你们愿意也好，不愿意也好，我们总是会生活得更好的。因此，让我们来竞赛吧。我想我们在改善我国人民生活方面的成就也会给资本主义国家的人民群众带来好处。如果我们的生活将会像现在这样快地得到改善，那么其他国家的工人就会看见所发生的事情。而资本家呢，他们为了不失去对本国的统治，也将会更加注意工人和他们的要求，这样一来，我们将间接帮助资本主义国家生活水平的提高。这也是不错的。
    最后，联合国记者协会主席弗雷德里克夫人代表所有到会的记者感谢米高扬所作的详细回答。她说，我想表达许多人的希望：您的访问将是为了拯救下一代不受战争灾祸而进行的更加积极争取和平的斗争的开始。
    下午，米高扬在外交学会会议上发表了讲话，有五百多名美国社会人士出席了这个会议，会议没有准许记者采访。
    米高扬和他的随行人员昨天晚上乘火车前往华盛顿。
