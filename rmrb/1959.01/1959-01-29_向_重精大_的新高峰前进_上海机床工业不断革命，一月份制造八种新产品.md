    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th January: This year, Shanghai's mechanical industry department has proposed three major tasks to completely change the face of Shanghai's machine tool industry.

    1.  To meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national machinery industry, it is necessary to develop towards heavy, large, and precision products at a greater pace. This year, Shanghai will not only mass-produce large gear hobbing machines, vertical lathes, and gantry planers, but also trial-produce ultra-heavy-duty nine-meter vertical lathes and five-meter-wide, twenty-meter-long gantry planers. Each of these machine tools weighs hundreds of tons, and two railroad freight cars can be parked on the platform of the twenty-meter gantry planer. At the same time, more precise grinding machines with workpiece precision reaching zero-grade will also be manufactured.

    2.  Serialization of machine tool products. This requires the production of more than 100 new varieties this year, including lathes, planers, drills, milling machines, hobbing machines, grinding machines, and other machine tools, as well as forging and pressing, and shearing equipment. At the same time, new products such as measuring tools, cutting tools, and grinding wheels should be added, so that Shanghai's machine tool industry can equip complete sets of equipment for medium-sized machinery factories.

    3.  Improve the quality of general machine tools. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai has changed the low-speed eight-foot lathe with 600 revolutions per minute to a lathe with 1,200 revolutions per minute. Due to the high speed, one machine can be used in place of two old-fashioned lathes.

    Last year, Shanghai's machine tool industry produced more than 12,880 machine tools, an increase of 1.8 times compared with 1957. It also successfully trial-produced a 4.5-meter vertical lathe and high-precision gear grinding machines and screw grinding machines, greatly improving the manufacturing level. Based on this, Shanghai's machine tool industry will have a greater leap forward in production this year in accordance with the above-mentioned three major tasks. The main methods are to rely on existing manpower and equipment, tap production potential, and improve technical level. Last year's experience proved that implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods can more quickly enable Shanghai's machine tool industry to develop in the direction of heavy, large, and precise products. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, nearly 40 machine tool factories in the city continued to carry out mass movements and build indigenous equipment, using the methods of "small becomes big," "rough becomes fine," and "indigenous becomes foreign" to vigorously attack new heavy, large, and precise products. Eight new products have been manufactured in January, including large machine tools such as a two-meter gear hobbing machine, a three-meter roll turning lathe, and a 140 mm boring machine. After the workers of Shanghai Heavy Machine Tool Plant made the country's largest 4.5-meter vertical lathe with self-made indigenous lathes on New Year's Day this year, they are now manufacturing large and simple machine tools such as an eight-meter gantry milling machine and a seven-meter lathe, creating conditions for manufacturing larger machine tools. In order to better unleash the potential of existing factories, Shanghai Machine Tool Company started reorganizing and adjusting the existing machine tool factories as early as last year. In addition to several machine tool factories that have been reorganized into heavy machine tool manufacturing plants, six factories have recently been organized to specialize in the production of standard parts, accessories, auxiliary tools, and special parts such as gears, which will allow some factories to concentrate their efforts on producing the main components of machine tools, which will greatly improve output and quality.

    In order to ensure the completion of this year's machine tool production tasks, several new factories are being accelerated.

    向“重精大”的新高峰前进
    上海机床工业不断革命，一月份制造八种新产品
    据新华社上海28日电　今年上海市机械工业部门已经提出了彻底改变上海机床工业面貌的三大主要任务。
    一、适应全国机械工业高速度发展的需要，要以更大的步伐向重型、大型、精密产品方向发展。今年上海不仅要大批生产大型滚齿机、立式车床、龙门刨床，还要试制超重型的九米立车和五米宽二十米长的龙门刨。这些机床每台重达数百吨，二十米龙门刨的平台上可以停放两节火车货车厢。同时，还要制造出工作物精度达到零级的更精密的磨床。
    二、机床产品系列化。要求今年生产一百多种新品种，包括车、刨、钻、铣、滚、磨等机床和锻压、冲剪设备，同时要增加量具、刃具、砂轮等新产品，使上海机床工业能够装备中型机械厂的整套设备。
    三、提高一般机床的质量。今年年初起，上海已经把每分钟六百转的低速八呎车床，改为每分钟一千二百转的车床；由于转速高，一台可以抵两台老式车床使用。
    上海机床工业去年共生产了一万二千八百八十多台机床，比1957年产量增长一点八倍；并试制成功了四点五米立式车床和高精度齿轮磨床、螺丝磨床，制造水平提高了一大步。在这个基础上，今年上海机床工业根据上述三大任务，生产将有更大的跃进。办法主要是依靠现有人力和设备，发掘生产潜力，提高技术水平。去年的经验证明，贯彻土洋并举的方针，可以更加迅速地使上海机床工业向重型、大型、精密的方向发展。因此，今年年初，全市近四十家机床工厂都继续大搞群众运动、大造土设备，以“小加大”、“粗出细”、“土出洋”的办法，猛攻重型、大型、精密的新产品，1月份制造的新产品已有八种，其中有二米滚齿机，三米轧辊车床和一百四十公厘搪床等大型机床。上海重型机床厂职工们用自制的土车床在今年元旦制成全国最大的四点五米立式车床以后，现在又制造出八米龙门铣和七米车床等大型简易机床，为制造更大的机床创造了条件。为了更好地发挥现有工厂的潜力，上海市机床公司早在去年就着手对现有各机床工厂进行改组调整，除了已有几个机床厂改组为重型机床制造厂以外，最近还组织六个工厂专门生产齿轮等标准件、附件、附属工具及专用件，好让一部分工厂集中力量生产机床主要部件，这样对于提高产量、质量都将起很大作用。
    为了保证今年机床生产任务的完成，几个新的工厂正在加速兴建。
