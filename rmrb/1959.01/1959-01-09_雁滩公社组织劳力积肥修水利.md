According to the Gansu Daily, the Yantan People's Commune in Lanzhou, a national agricultural advanced unit, is enthusiastically responding to the Ten Proposals.

Based on the spirit of the proposals, and after discussions among the masses, the commune has put forward this year's production leap forward targets and measures. Among them, the per-mu yield of grain, vegetables, and melons will double compared to last year; implementing the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficiency production and commodity production, the commune is starting to run factories on a large scale and vigorously develop diversified economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This year, the commune will expand and build more than 20 commune-run factories, including steel plants, cement plants, machine repair plants, lime plants, and fertilizer plants; at the same time, it will vigorously develop livestock and poultry breeding. On the basis of vigorously developing production, the income of commune members will be increased.

At present, while the commune party committee is conducting in-depth rectification and study, it is also focusing on winter production centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and has organized about 50% of the labor force to engage in fertilizer accumulation. In addition, it has also organized more than 500 core militia to fight against the North Mountain. In more than half a month, they have built more than 2,000 mu of terraced fields, and three reservoirs that can irrigate 400 mu of land have also been started.

    雁滩公社组织劳力积肥修水利
    据甘肃日报消息　全国农业先进单位——兰州市雁滩人民公社热烈响应十大倡议。
    根据倡议的精神，在群众讨论的基础上，公社提出了今年生产跃进的指标和措施。其中，粮食、蔬菜、瓜类的亩产量都比去年翻一番；贯彻工农业生产同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，公社正着手大办工厂和大力发展农林牧副渔等多种经济。这个社今年要扩建和兴建炼钢厂、水泥厂、机器修配厂、石灰厂、化肥厂、蔬菜加工厂等二十多个社办工厂；同时大力发展家畜家禽饲养工作。要在大力发展生产的基础上使社员增加收入。
    目前公社党委一边深入开展整社学习，一边大抓以兴修水利和积肥为中心的冬季生产，已组织了50％左右的劳动力搞积肥。此外，还组织了五百多基干民兵大战北山，半个多月来已修梯田二千多亩，可浇地四百亩的三个水库也已动工。
