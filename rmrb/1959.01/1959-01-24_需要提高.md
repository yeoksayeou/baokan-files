    Need to Improve
    The broad masses have a wealth of practical production knowledge, and their creative wisdom is inexhaustible. Many creations that have emerged since last year have been quickly applied to production. However, things always develop gradually from rough to fine, from low-level to high-level. A huge number of creations are often relatively crude in their initial stages, even in a nascent state. Although they have undeniable advantages, they also have shortcomings in certain aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to promptly summarize the colorful creations of the masses, and through collective evaluation and appraisal, continuously enrich and develop them, so that they become the most complete things within a certain period, in order to manufacture them in batches and promote them comprehensively.
    Last year was a year in which we achieved great harvests in all aspects, and countless creations and inventions emerged in all walks of life. These creations are our extremely valuable wealth. Timely finalizing, summarizing, and improving them, and then promoting them, will become the material foundation for achieving a greater leap forward this year. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Communications and Transportation's timely organization of the finalization and promotion of loading and unloading tools is a timely approach, and we hope that more units will do the same.

    需要提高
    广大群众有丰富的生产实践知识，他们的创造智慧是无穷无尽的。去年以来出现的许多创造已被迅速应用到生产上去。但是，事物总是由粗到细，从低级到高级，逐步发展的。有极大数量的创造在其初期往往是比较粗糙，甚至是萌芽状态的东西。它们虽然有无可置疑的优点，但在某些方面又存在不足之处。因此，需要对群众的万紫千红的创造，及时加以总结，通过集体的评比、鉴定，不断丰富、发展，使之成为一定时期内比较最完整的东西，以便成批制造和全面推广。
    去年这一年是我们在各个方面都获得大丰收的一年，各行各业都涌现出数不尽的创造和发明。这些创造是我们极其珍贵的财富。及时对它们进行定型、总结、提高，加以推广，就将成为今年实现更大跃进的物质基础。上海市交通运输局及时组织装卸工具的定型和推广工作，这种做法是适时的，我们希望有更多的单位这样做。
