Traditional Moral Strength Shines
——A Review of the Hunan Opera Troupe's Performances
Mei Lanfang

The Hunan Opera Troupe brought Qiju Opera and Yiyang Flower Drum Opera to Beijing audiences. Flower Drum Opera developed from Hunan folk songs, mountain songs, and ground flower drums. The melodies are beautiful and rich, with more than three hundred tunes, and they are widely spread. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Flower Drum Opera has been newly developed. Flower Drum Opera has become more beautiful after removing the dross and retaining the essence. It can not only reflect today's new people and new events, but also many traditional plays have been greatly improved. Qiju Opera is one of the ancient Gaoqiang operas. It has a very long history and is widely spread. It has many excellent traditional plays with unique styles.

The Hunan Opera Troupe performed two good plays this time: the Qiju Opera "昭君出塞" (Zhaojun's Departure) and the Yiyang Flower Drum Opera "生死牌" (The Card of Life and Death).

"昭君出塞" (Zhaojun's Departure) is a play that I performed in my early years. The Qiju Opera version of "出塞" (Departure) is similar in plot and lyrics to mine, except that it is performed in Gaoqiang. The "昭君出塞" (Zhaojun's Departure) I learned is in the "Shiju" style handed down from Kunqu Opera. The singing, music, and movements are relatively subtle, and the emotions are implicit. The Qiju Opera play expresses Zhaojun's sad and resentful mood more strongly, which can infect the audience. Xie Meixian, who plays Zhaojun, can portray Zhaojun's feelings of grief at the sight of the scenery and her longing for her homeland through her singing and acting. Wang Qiuxi, who plays the stable boy, is not only steady and beautiful in his acrobatics, but he also handles the role as a righteous person, which is very appropriate. In Peking Opera, Wang Long is played by a clown, but He Shaolian's Wang Long is played by a handsome young man. He accompanies Zhaojun all the way, always revealing sympathy for Zhaojun's painful experience and dissatisfaction with the court. Therefore, the inner thoughts and actions of these three characters echo each other. Although the play is not big, it is very refined and moving.

"生死牌" (The Card of Life and Death) is a traditional Flower Drum Opera play, also known as "三女抢板" (Three Daughters Grab the Board). It is said to be a real event that happened in Hengshan County during the Ming Dynasty. He Zongbing, a member of Yan Song's treacherous gang, falsely accused the commoner Wang Yuhuan of killing his son, and held the magistrate of Hengshan County, Huang Boxian, hostage, ordering him to execute her. Huang Boxian, who upheld justice, launched a sharp struggle with the tyrannical He Zongbing in order to rescue the innocent Wang Yuhuan. This play not only depicts the fair and honest official Huang Boxian, but also movingly depicts the noble qualities of the three young girls, Wang Yuhuan, Huang Xiulan, and Qiuping, who are fearless of evil forces, stand up bravely, and sacrifice themselves to save others. Wang Yuhuan is a wronged and weak woman. When she learns that Huang Boxian will lose his life and property to save her, she would rather sacrifice herself than implicate others. Huang Xiulan and Qiuping, in order to help Yuhuan, fulfill their father's painstaking efforts to uphold justice and repay friendship, are vying to die for Yuhuan. These three women take death so lightly, but their selfless behavior for justice is as heavy as Mount Tai! When the three women on the stage are fighting to die and hugging each other and crying, the drama brings the audience into a sublime realm. This is the moral strength of courage and fearlessness of the powerful that is manifested in each of them. This traditional moral strength shines brightly and touches the heart, which still has a great encouraging effect on today's audience.

The "Courtroom" scene prominently shows the sharp contradictions between Huang Boxian, Wang Yuhuan, and He Zongbing. On one side, He Zongbing threatens with a sword, and on the other side, Wang Yuhuan shouts loudly for injustice. The focus of the contradiction is concentrated on Huang Boxian, who sits in the center of the stage. Zhou Yongnian, who plays Huang Boxian, sings, "If this case is not investigated, I will lose my official hat and my head; if the commoner girl is beheaded, will she not leave a lasting regret for thousands of years?" From his facial expressions and looking around, he distinctly expresses the complex mood of the character at the forefront of the contradiction. Huang Yingyun, who plays Wang Yuhuan, excellently uses a blank stare to express the character's tense mood at the critical moment of life and death when Huang Boxian sings, "If the commoner girl is beheaded." The tense scene created by the three characters on the stage makes the audience worry about Yuhuan's life. The three actors did not change their positions much on the stage, but the struggle between good and evil was so intense!

In the "Back Hall" scene, the contradiction becomes more acute as Huang Boxian learns about Wang Yuhuan's background. This is not only to relieve the people's worries, but also adds the deep friendship with Wang Zhijian. The dramatic conflict further extends to his daughter Huang Xiulan and adopted daughter Qiuping. In this scene, when Huang Xiulan and Qiuping are fighting to die for Yuhuan, when Wang Yuhuan does not want to implicate the Huang family, when Huang Boxian is in a state of inner pain and contradiction, the three young girls on the stage hug each other and cry, and the audience is deeply moved by their noble character of sacrificing themselves to save others. Then comes the climax of "搶牌" (grabbing the card), which expresses the tense atmosphere of the three young girls drawing cards to die through singing and dancing movements. The movements of drawing the cards three times are layered and varied. Each time they draw the cards, they tightly grasp the audience, especially the third time. Finally, the death card is drawn by Wang Yuhuan, and Xiulan and Qiuping are fighting to grab the death card. The wooden card is snatched into three pieces by the three people. Huang Boxian comes on stage with a lantern and sees that the word "death" is in his daughter's hands. At this time, Qiuping sings: "The wooden card is divided on both sides," Yuhuan sings: "I will never implicate others," Xiulan sings: "I am willing to die myself," and Huang Boxian sings: "Heaven fulfills people's wishes," which profoundly reveals the wishes of each person. When only Huang Boxian and his daughter are left on the stage, their farewell before parting is truly tragic. Young actors Liao Ronghua, who plays Huang Xiulan, and Wang Guoxiang, who plays Qiuping, are both very outstanding.

The drama structure of "生死牌" (The Card of Life and Death) is very compact. The struggle between good and evil grabs the audience's heart from beginning to end. "搶牌" (Grabbing the card) is a tense climax, but immediately after this climax, a surprising twist occurs, forming a new climax in the "Execution Ground." Huang Boxian has his daughter Xiulan impersonate Yuhuan to be executed. In front of the military officer sent by He Zongbing, the father and daughter do not dare to reveal any flaws. The two of them try their best to restrain their greatest grief. When Huang Boxian raises his vermilion pen to pronounce the execution of his own daughter, the two actors very excellently express this critical scene through their eyes and gestures. On the execution ground, Huang Boxian wants to execute the sentence earlier, but the military officer obstructs him in order for He Zongbing to come and supervise the execution in person. Here, the audience is once again worried that the arrival of He Zongbing will expose everything, causing Huang's father and daughter, as well as Yuhuan, Qiuping, and others, to be harmed. While they are arguing, Wang Zhijian arrives at the execution ground. On the one hand, he scolds Huang Boxian for being ungrateful, and on the other hand, he cries bitterly with his "daughter." When he discovers that Huang Xiulan is not his daughter, He Zongbing happens to arrive. He discovers that Wang Yuhuan has been replaced. In a rage, he takes down Huang Boxian, Wang Zhijian, and others together. Then, Hai Rui, the Hunan inspector, arrives. His arrival reverses the unjust case. As the righteous forces on the stage defeat the evil forces, the audience breathes a sigh of relief and rejoices for the victory of Huang's father and daughter and Wang Yuhuan and others. Sun Yangsheng, who plays Hai Rui, sings very movingly. His voice is broad and bright, and his movements are unrestrained, showing that he is trying to express the demeanor of the inspector on a private visit. Guo Yuhong, who plays Yuhuan's aunt Zhang, very appropriately expresses the old woman's concern and love for her niece from the first scene. When Yuhuan is wronged, she further expresses the character's fearless personality. Guo Yuhong is a senior Flower Drum Opera actress. This role and Hai Rui do not have many scenes, but the actors perform very well.

The ideological and artistic qualities of this play are very high. If there is anything lacking, I think that in the "Back Hall" scene, Xiulan and Qiuping hear about Yuhuan's grievances in the background. I think it would be better to add a screen on the stage. When they find Huang Boxian worried, they retreat behind the screen, and when they finish listening to the conversation between Huang Boxian and Yuhuan, they come out of the screen. This may be better than secretly entering the background, so that these two characters can clearly explain this important plot to the audience and let the audience know that they heard everything behind. Of course, this is not to say that they should always stand behind the screen, but they can go from behind the screen to the background.

"生死牌" (The Card of Life and Death) and "昭君出塞" (Zhaojun's Departure) are the first good plays I have seen in the new year of 1959, which is something to be happy about.

    传统道德力量闪烁着光辉
    ——评湖南戏曲艺术团的演出
    梅兰芳
    湖南戏曲艺术团给北京观众带来了祁剧和益阳花鼓戏。花鼓戏是从湖南民歌、山歌、地花鼓等发展起来的，曲调优美丰富，有三百多种，而且流传甚广。解放后，在党的领导下，花鼓戏得到了新的发展。花鼓戏去芜存菁后，更优美了，它既能反映今天的新人新事，许多传统剧又有了很大的提高。祁剧是古老的高腔戏之一，它的历史是很悠久的，流传也广泛，它有不少优秀的具有独特风格的传统剧目。
    湖南戏曲艺术团这次演出了两出好戏祁剧“昭君出塞”和益阳花鼓戏“生死牌”。
      “昭君出塞”是我早年演过的戏，祁剧的“出塞”除了是以高腔演出和我不同之外，情节词句都是差不多的。我所学的“昭君出塞”，是昆腔遗留下来的“时剧”路子，唱腔、音乐、身段都比较含蓄，情感内蕴。祁剧这出戏，对昭君悲怨的心情，表现得比较强烈，很能感染观众。谢美仙扮昭君，唱做都能刻划昭君见景生悲、怀恋故国的心情。王求喜扮演马童，不但翻跌工架稳当好看，而且把他处理成一个有正义感的人物，非常适当。在京剧里，王龙是丑角扮演的，何少连的王龙是小生俊扮，他一路伴送昭君，时刻流露出对昭君痛苦遭遇的同情和对朝廷的不满，因此，这三个剧中人的内心和动作都是互相呼应的，戏虽然不大，却很精炼动人。
    “生死牌”是花鼓戏的一出传统剧目，又名“三女抢板”。据说还是明朝发生在衡山县的一桩实事。严嵩奸党贺总兵诬赖民女王玉环害死他的儿子，挟持衡山知县黄伯贤，命他处以死刑，主持正义的黄伯贤，为了营救无辜的王玉环，与凶横的贺总兵展开了一场尖锐的斗争。这出戏不仅描写了为官公正的黄伯贤，而且非常动人地写出了王玉环、黄秀兰、秋萍三个少女对恶势力毫不畏惧、挺身而出、舍已救人的高尚品质。王玉环是被冤屈的弱女子，当她知道黄伯贤为了救她将要丢掉身家性命时，她宁愿牺牲自己，也不愿牵连别人；黄秀兰和秋萍，为了搭救玉环，成全父亲主持公正、报答友情的苦心，而争着要替玉环去死。这三个女子，把死看得这么轻如鸿毛，而她们这种为了正义而忘我的行为却是重如泰山！当舞台上三个女子争着去死而相抱痛哭时，戏剧把观众带进了一个崇高的境界，这就是他们每一个人身上所表现出来的那股见义勇为、不畏强权的道德力量。这种传统的道德力量，闪烁着强烈的光辉，感人肺腑，这对今天的观众来讲，仍然有极大的鼓舞作用。
      “公堂”一场，突出地表现了黄伯贤、王玉环和贺总兵的尖锐矛盾。一面是贺总兵拔剑威吓，一面是王玉环大声唤冤，矛盾的焦点集中坐在舞台正中的黄伯贤身上。演黄伯贤的周永年，唱到“若是此案不追究，要丢乌纱和人头；若将民女来斩首，岂不叫她遗恨千秋”时，从面部表情、左右回顾中，层次分明地表现了角色处于矛盾尖端的复杂心情。而演王玉环的黄英芸，当黄伯贤唱到“若将民女来斩首”时，他很出色地用了一个呆像来表达角色处于生死关键的紧张心情。三个人物在舞台上构成的这种紧张场面，使观众很替玉环的生命担忧。三位演员在台上没有怎么变换地位，但是善与恶的斗争却那么强烈！
    在“后堂”一场中，矛盾随着黄伯贤知道王玉环的身世而更加尖锐起来，这不仅是要为民分忧，而且加上了和王志坚的深情厚谊。戏剧冲突进一步引伸到他的女儿黄秀兰和义女秋萍身上。这一场，当黄秀兰和秋萍争着要替玉环一死时，当王玉环不愿牵连黄家时，当黄伯贤处于内心痛苦矛盾之中时，舞台上三个少女抱头相哭，观众深深地为他们这种舍己救人的高尚品德所激动。紧接着是“抢牌”的高潮，通过唱和舞蹈身段，表现这三个少女摸牌替死的紧张气氛。三次摸牌的身段都是有层次有变化的，每次摸牌都紧紧抓住观众，特别是第三次，最后一块死牌被王玉环摸着，秀兰和秋萍争着去抢这块死牌，木牌被三个人抢成了三块，黄伯贤提灯上场一看，“死”字在自己女儿手中。这时，秋萍唱道：“木牌两边分”玉环唱出：“岂肯连累人”秀兰唱：“一死本人愿”黄伯贤唱着：“苍天顺人情”，非常深刻地揭示出每个人的心愿。等到台上剩下黄伯贤父女二人，他们生离死别前的倾诉，真是悲壮极了。青年演员廖荣华演的黄秀兰和王国香演的秋萍，都是很出色的。
    “生死牌”这出戏，在戏剧结构上非常紧凑，善与恶的斗争自始至终地抓住观众的心弦，“抢牌”是一个紧张的高潮，但是紧接着这场高潮之后，奇峰突起，在“法场”中再一次形成新的高潮。黄伯贤把女儿秀兰冒充玉环处死，父女二人在贺总兵派来的中军面前，不敢露出破绽，他们二人尽力克制着自己最大的悲痛。当黄伯贤当着亲生女儿举起朱笔判斩时，两位演员非常出色地从眼神、手势中，表现出这个千钧一发的场面。在法场上，黄伯贤是想早点执刑，中军却从中阻挡，以便贺总兵亲来监斩，这里观众又再一次担心贺总兵的到来会被识破一切，使黄家父女以及玉环、秋萍等人全都遭害。正在争执不休中，王志坚来到法场，他一方面痛骂黄伯贤忘恩负义，一方面与“女儿”苦苦哭诉，等到他发现黄秀兰不是自己女儿时，贺总兵正好赶来。贺发觉王玉环被人替换了，一怒之下，将黄伯贤、王志坚等人一并拿下，紧接着湖南巡按海瑞赶到，他的到来，平反了这场冤狱。随着舞台上正义力量战胜邪恶势力，观众大快人心地吁了一口气，为黄家父女和王玉环等人的胜利而欢悦不已。孙阳生演海瑞，他唱得很动人，嗓音宽亮，身段洒脱，看得出他处处都在表现这位微服私访的巡按的气度。郭玉鉷扮演玉环的姨母张氏，他从第一场戏里就很贴切地表现了这个老太太对外甥女的关心爱护，等到玉环被冤，他进一步表现出角色那种不畏强暴的性格。郭玉鉷是花鼓戏的前辈花旦，这个角色和海瑞，戏虽然不多，但是，演员都演得十分杰出。
    这出戏的思想性艺术性都是很高的。如果说还有什么不足的话，我认为，“后堂”一场，秀兰、秋萍是在后台听到玉环被冤的情由的，我想若能在台上加上一扇屏风，当她们发现黄伯贤忧心如焚时，就退到屏风后，等到听完黄伯贤和玉环对话，再走出屏风，这样可能要比暗暗进入后台好一些，使这两个人物在这个重要情节上，向观众交代得清楚一些，让观众知道她们是在后面听到了这一切，当然这不是说她们要一直站在屏风后，而且可以由屏风后转入后台的。
    “生死牌”“昭君出塞”是1959年新年里我第一次看到的好戏，这是值得高兴的事。
