    Do Meticulous Cultural Work
    Ai Bei

    The Party requires our work to become more and more meticulous. Economic work must become more and more meticulous; shouldn't cultural work also become more and more meticulous? It should become even more meticulous. Because cultural work is the work of transforming and developing people's spiritual world, and people each have different personalities, and the activities of the spiritual world have their own special laws, which are much more complex than the laws of economic work. Cultural work should be guided by communist ideology, taking into account people's different requirements, different hobbies, and different talents. Just imagine, among thousands upon thousands of people, how meticulous the work is to figure this out! Advocating meticulous handling of affairs according to characteristics requires opposing simplistic and generalized approaches. Taking poetry and singing as examples, it can be said that the poets of our era are more numerous than those of any previous era; the singers of our era are more numerous than those of any previous era. But can everyone write poetry? Can everyone be a singer? That is not necessarily the case, and it is also impossible. Because everyone has their own hobbies and strengths! A poet may be very good at writing poetry but very poor at singing; conversely, the same situation may occur. Isn't this a common occurrence in real life? Therefore, it is wrong to use a simplistic method to require everyone to sing and write poetry. This is neglecting everyone's different personalities, characteristics, and hobbies; it is a crude approach that simplifies complex and meticulous work.

    Should our cultural work be popularized? Of course, it should be popularized, and today's popularization is not enough; it should be popularized to every corner of our country. Popularizing culture is the demand of the broad masses of people and the task of the Party's cultural revolution. In many places, based on the masses' own demands, the creativity of the masses is promoted, coming from the masses and going to the masses, and a variety of cultural activities are carried out under leadership. Those who like to paint don't have to write poetry; those who like to sing don't have to paint. We do not seek uniformity, but hope for a hundred flowers to bloom, achieving "peach blossoms and plum blossoms are all praised," rather than "lotus leaves stretching to the sky, an endless green." Such cultural popularization work is diverse popularization, not single popularization; it is popularization that takes into account characteristics, not popularization that only takes into account generalities. At the same time, popularization work must be combined with improvement, popularizing while improving, and truly implementing improvement on the basis of popularization and popularization under the guidance of improvement. Only by carrying out popularization work in this way will it not be a passing fad and will be able to last.

    If cultural work can take into account characteristics and fully mobilize the masses, then it can be believed that it will rapidly improve. Because everyone will give full play to their strengths according to their own hobbies, which makes it possible for each person to make the best contribution they can in a certain aspect. This is of great significance for the improvement of the entire cultural work. Putting together the best contributions from all aspects and absorbing as much as possible all the excellent culture of ancient times and foreign countries will gradually form the peak of our country's culture. Our great 600 million people, through their own efforts, should have their own cultural peak. From the practice of cultural work in various places, we have already seen the prospects for this peak.

    Cultural work has its particularity, and we should take this particularity into account. However, some people excessively exaggerate the particularity of cultural work, even mystifying it, causing people to fall into a fog, unfathomable. They do not believe that the working people can create and master culture, and they believe that cultural work is above all else, only a matter for a few intellectuals, and they take a cold attitude towards the cultural activities of the masses. Naturally, this will sever the connection between cultural work and proletarian politics and socialist economic construction, advocating culture for culture's sake, and guiding cultural work onto the wrong path, which is something we cannot allow. The particularity of cultural work lies in the fact that it is a kind of ideological work, and this ideological work must fully take into account everyone's characteristics. Labor creates culture, and the working people should and can master culture.

    Soaring drive must be combined with scientific analysis. It is necessary to give play to subjective initiative (which is needed at all times), but it is also necessary to act in accordance with objective laws. Mastering objective laws and applying objective laws, for cultural work, it is particularly important to pay attention to the different ideological characteristics of people, according to the laws of ideological activities, and not to treat everyone uniformly. This is a problem that must be emphasized at all times.

    细致地做好文化工作
    艾北
    党要求我们的工作要愈做愈细致。经济工作要愈做愈细致，文化工作要不要愈做愈细致呢？更加要愈做愈细致。因为文化工作是改造和发展人们的精神世界的工作，人们各自有不同的个性，精神世界的活动自有其特殊的规律，比起经济工作的活动规律要更加复杂得多。文化工作应该在共产主义的思想指导下，照顾到人们不同的要求，不同的爱好，不同的才能来进行自己的工作。试想在千千万万人中间，要去摸清这个底，是多么细致的工作啊！提倡细致地按特点办事，就要反对简单化和一般化的作法。以写诗和唱歌为例，可以说，我们时代的诗人，比以往任何时代的诗人都要多；我们时代的歌手，比以往任何时代的歌手都要多。但是，是不是人人都可以做诗呢？是不是人人都可以做歌手呢？那就不一定，而且也不可能。因为各人有各人的爱好和特长么！一个诗人，可以诗做得挺好，而歌唱得很差，换个位置，也可能有同样的情况。这不是现实生活中的常事吗？因此，用简单化的办法，要求人人唱歌、做诗，这就不对头了，这就是忽略人人不同的个性、特点、爱好的做法，是个粗线条的做法，把复杂细致的工作简单化了。
    我们的文化工作要不要普及呢？当然要普及，而且今天的普及还不够，还要普及到我国的每个角落里去。普及文化是广大人民的要求，是党的文化革命的任务。许多地方，根据群众自己的要求，发扬群众的创造性，从群众中来，到群众中去，有领导地开展多种多样的文化活动，喜欢画画的，不写诗也可以；喜欢唱歌的，不画画也可以。不求千篇一律，但望百花争放，做到“桃红李白皆夸好”，而不是“接天莲叶无穷碧”。这样的文化普及工作，是多样的普及，而不是单一的普及；是照顾特点的普及，而不是只顾一般的普及。同时普及工作必须和提高相结合，边普及，边提高，真正实行在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。只有这样地进行普及工作，才不是一阵风，才能持久下去。
    文化工作如果能照顾特点，充分发动群众，那末，可以相信，将会迅速获得提高。因为，每个人将按照自己的爱好，充分发挥自己的特长，这就有可能各自在某一方面作出他自己所能做到的最好的贡献。这对于整个文化工作的提高是有重要意义的。把各方面的最好的贡献汇集起来，并且尽量吸收古代的和外国的一切优秀文化，这样，就会逐步形成我国文化的高峰。我们伟大的六亿人民经过自己的努力，应当有自己的文化高峰，这个高峰，从各地文化工作的实践中，我们已经看到了它的远景。
    文化工作有它的特殊性，我们应该照顾到这种特殊性，但是，有人过分夸大了文化工作的特殊性，甚至把它神秘化，使人堕入五里雾中，莫测高深。他们不相信劳动人民能够创造和掌握文化，认为文化工作高于一切，只是少数知识分子的事情，对群众的文化活动采取冷淡的态度。那自然会割断文化工作同无产阶级政治和社会主义经济建设的联系，提倡为文化而文化，把文化工作引导到错误的道路上去，那是我们所不能允许的。文化工作的特殊性，是在于它是一种思想工作，而这种思想工作又必须充分照顾到各人的特点。劳动创造文化，劳动人民是应该而且能够掌握文化的。
    冲天干劲，要同科学分析相结合。要发挥主观能动性（这是在任何时候都需要的），但是也要按照客观规律办事。掌握客观规律，运用客观规律，对于文化工作来说，特别要注意按照人们的不同的思想特点，按照思想活动的规律，不能千篇一律地对待，这是在什么时候都要重视的问题。
