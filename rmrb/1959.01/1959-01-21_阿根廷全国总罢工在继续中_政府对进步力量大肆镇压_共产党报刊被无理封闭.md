Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 20th: The nationwide general strike launched by the Argentine working people on the 18th is continuing. On the first day of the strike, two million people in Buenos Aires alone participated. Due to this general strike, industry, businesses, and government offices have ceased work, urban transportation is paralyzed, and the flights of Argentine Airlines have also been grounded. Yesterday, no newspapers were published, and postal and telephone services were completely halted.

Faced with the growing demands of the broad masses of people for improving their lives and safeguarding national interests, the Argentine government is further using violent means to suppress the strike and crack down on progressive forces in Argentina. According to reports, seventy Argentine trade union leaders were arrested on the 19th, and trade union headquarters and some local trade union committees were closed down. News reports indicate that government police attacked the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party and various regional committees. The Argentine Communist Party's official newspaper, "The Times," and the weekly "Our Words" were brutally shut down. Other news reports indicate that the government is mobilizing troops from various regions, preparing for further armed suppression.

    阿根廷全国总罢工在继续中
    政府对进步力量大肆镇压　共产党报刊被无理封闭
    新华社20日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷劳动人民18日开始的全国规模的总罢工仍在继续中。罢工的第一天，仅在布宜诺斯艾利斯一地就有二百万人参加了罢工。由于这次总罢工，工业、企业和机关都停止了工作，城市交通陷于瘫痪，阿根廷航空公司的飞机也都停航。昨天没有报纸出版，邮政、电话也完全停顿了。
    面临广大人民日益增长的改善生活和保卫民族利益的强烈要求，阿根廷政府正在进一步用暴力手段来镇压罢工和打击阿根廷的进步力量。据报道，19日有七十名阿根廷工会领袖被捕，工会总部和一些工会地方委员会遭受封闭。消息说，政府警察袭击了阿根廷共产党中央委员会和各个地区委员会。阿根廷共产党机关报“时报”和“我们的话”周报被横蛮封闭。另有消息说，政府正在从各地调动军队，准备更进一步地实行武力镇压。
