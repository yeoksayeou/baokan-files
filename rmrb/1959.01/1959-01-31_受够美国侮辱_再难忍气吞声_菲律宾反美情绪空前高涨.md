(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The increasingly tense relations between the United States and the Philippines have recently taken another step forward. Because the United States continues to treat the Philippines' dissatisfaction with the arrogant attitude of a suzerain state, especially the recent unreasonable insult to Philippine President Garcia in the American "Time" magazine, it has aroused strong anti-American sentiment in all sectors of the Philippines. The United States vigorously attacks the Philippines.
    President Garcia suffers malicious insults.

    The latest issue of the American "Time" magazine launched a personal attack on Philippine President Garcia. The magazine described Garcia and his government officials as "fat cats" "frolicking in the beautiful Manila casinos," and criticized them for "doing a lot to reduce the luster of the Philippines as a democratic showcase in Asia."

    Presidential Press Secretary Nable of the Philippines issued a statement on the 28th condemning "Time" magazine's "slander" against the Philippine President.

    Philippine Senator Tolentino said on the 29th regarding the "Time" magazine incident: "Some Americans feel like rulers or masters, and they are annoyed when they think that their 'subordinates' have shown signs of wanting to experience the dignity of true independence." He said: "This article should make us see the fact that our frequent requests for assistance from the United States give the impression of dependence or 'subordination'."

    Representative Ligot, speaking in the House of Representatives to condemn the defamatory article in "Time" magazine, demanded a break in relations with the United States.

    Some senators, led by Recto, pointed out that the "Time" magazine article is part of an American propaganda campaign to discredit the Philippines. Dissatisfied with the United States as a "master"

    Philippine newspapers advocate taking an independent and autonomous road.

    After the Philippines increasingly strongly demanded the adjustment of the unequal relationship between the United States and the Philippines, American newspapers widely launched attacks on the Philippine authorities. Manila is very dissatisfied that the United States still treats the Philippines with the attitude of a "master."

    Soliongco, a columnist for the "Manila Chronicle," commented that if there is an insidious anti-Philippine propaganda campaign in American officialdom and the press today, it is because the Philippines is currently concerned with "rebuilding US-Philippine relations on the basis of autonomy and equality."

    The columnist wrote on January 25 that in the past, the Philippines had accepted all the demands made by the United States, whether it was the "Equal Rights Act" or the military base agreement. He said that when the United States needed one more vote in the United Nations, the Philippines was there waiting to vote, even if doing so would put itself in a difficult situation.

    He said: "If the Philippines firmly stands up and does what it thinks is good, regardless of what the United States may think, perhaps it will be more respected."

    Members of the Philippine Congress who reviewed Philippine-American relations fiercely criticized American policy.

    Under these circumstances, the Philippine Congress also began to review Philippine-American relations. Romulo, the Philippine ambassador to the United States who was recently recalled, reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 28th. News revealed that at the secret meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee that day, some members fiercely criticized American policy.

    It can be seen from Romulo's report that has been revealed that the United States does not intend to relax its control and enslavement of the Philippines. A United Press International correspondent in Manila admitted on the 25th that Philippine congressmen have an increasing aversion to the US attitude toward the Philippines. The reporter also listed a list of "Philippine senators who strongly advocate reducing dependence on the United States."

### 受够美国侮辱　再难忍气吞声  菲律宾反美情绪空前高涨

    受够美国侮辱　再难忍气吞声
    菲律宾反美情绪空前高涨
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：最近以来日趋紧张的美国和菲律宾的关系，又有了进一步的发展。由于美国继续以宗主国的傲慢态度来对待菲律宾的不满情绪，特别是最近一期美国“时代”周刊对菲律宾总统加西亚的无理侮辱，更激起了菲律宾各界的强烈反美情绪。美国对菲律宾大肆攻击
    加西亚总统受恶毒侮辱
    最近一期的美国“时代”杂志对菲律宾总统加西亚展开了人身攻击。这家杂志把加西亚和他的政府官员说成是“在漂亮的马尼拉赌场寻欢作乐的”“胖猫”，它批评他们“做了很多事情来减少菲律宾这个亚洲民主橱窗的光彩”。
    菲律宾总统府新闻秘书纳布莱28日发表谈话谴责“时代”杂志对菲律宾总统进行的“诽谤”。
    菲律宾参议员托伦蒂诺29日就“时代”杂志事件说：“一些美国人觉得自己像统治者或者主人一样，一想到‘属下’有迹象想体会一下真正的独立的尊严，他们就感到恼火”。他说：“这篇文章应该使我们看到这样一个事实：我们经常要求美国给予援助一事给人一种依赖或者‘隶属’的印象”。
    众议员利果特在众议院发言谴责“时代”杂志的诽谤性文章时要求断绝同美国的关系。
    以雷克托为首的一些参议员指出，“时代”杂志的文章是美国诋毁菲律宾的宣传运动的一部分。不满美国以“主子”自居
    菲报主张走独立自主道路
    在菲律宾日益强烈地要求调整美菲之间的不平等关系以后，美国报刊广泛地对菲律宾当局展开攻击。马尼拉方面很不满意美国仍然以“主子”的态度对待菲律宾。
    “马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家索力昂科发表评论说：如果今天在美国官方和报界中有一个反对菲律宾的阴险的宣传运动的话，这是因为目前菲律宾关心把美菲关系“重建在自主和平等的基础上”。
    这位专栏作家曾经在1月25日写道：过去凡是美国提出的要求，菲律宾都加以接受，不管它是“平等权利法案”或者是军事基地协定。他说，当美国在联合国需要多一票，菲律宾就在那里等着投票，纵使那样做会使自己陷入困境。
    他说：“如果菲律宾坚定地站起来，认为甚么好就干甚么，而不管美国会有甚么感想，也许它将会较为受到尊重。”
    菲律宾国会审查菲美关系议员们激烈抨击美国政策
    在这种情况下菲律宾国会也开始审查菲美关系。最近被召回国的菲律宾驻美国大使罗慕洛28日向众议院外交委员会作了汇报。有消息透露，在外交委员会当天的秘密会议上，某些议员极为激烈地批评了美国的政策。
    从透露出来的罗慕洛的汇报中可以看出，美国并不打算放松它对菲律宾的控制和奴役。合众国际社驻马尼拉记者25日承认：菲律宾的国会议员对于美国对菲律宾的态度有日益增强的反感。这个记者还开列了一个“强烈主张减少对美国的依赖的菲律宾参议员”的名单。
