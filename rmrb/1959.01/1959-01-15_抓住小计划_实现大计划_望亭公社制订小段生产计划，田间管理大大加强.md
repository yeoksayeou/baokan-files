　　Grasp Small Plans to Achieve Big Plans
　　Wangting Commune Formulates Small-Scale Production Plans, Field Management Greatly Strengthened
　　Nanjing Dispatch from our Newspaper on the 14th: The Wangting People's Commune in Wu County, Jiangsu Province, has recently restored and developed small-scale production plans as the first step in rectifying its business management. Since mid-December of last year, the Third Brigade of this commune has effectively strengthened the management of current overwintering crops by formulating small-scale production plans, enabling cadres and commune members to have a clear understanding of current production tasks and specific goals.
　　The Third Production Brigade was established by merging three small cooperatives during the communization. In the situation of a greater leap forward in agricultural production, although this brigade formulated annual and quarterly production plans some time ago, it did not formulate small-scale production plans, resulting in cadres being overwhelmed with tasks, daily dispatching and summoning of workers, and temporary recruitment of personnel. Cadres often had no idea what work to do each day, every few days, or during each period, and who should do it. Commune members also lacked clear division of labor, waiting after finishing one task, resulting in low labor efficiency.
　　In this rectification of business management, the brigade's general branch, in order to make production order more organized, successively convened meetings of production team leaders, labor group leaders, and commune members. Starting from summarizing the achievements since communization and the production in the previous stage, they studied the formulation of small-scale plans, and organized cadres and commune members to fully discuss issues such as whether or not to formulate small-scale plans, and what benefits there are to formulating small-scale plans. Small-scale plans were then quickly promoted throughout the brigade.
　　The small-scale plans of the Third Production Brigade are formulated by production team as a unit, generally once every seven days. Up to now, three plans have been formulated. The specific approach is: each production team, according to the unified plans of the commune and the brigade and the requirements for current production, based on the specific conditions of the team's current production tasks, differentiates between priorities and calculates the amount of labor required for each production project and the time required. Specifically, three alignments are carried out – alignment of agricultural tasks, alignment of labor force, and alignment of quantity, quality, and time to complete tasks. This ensures that the labor force is determined by the agricultural tasks, the workload is determined by the strength and skills of the labor force, the quality is determined by the requirements of the agricultural tasks, and both primary and secondary tasks are taken care of comprehensively.
　　After the small-scale plan is formulated, a meeting of commune members is convened to fully promote democracy, mobilize commune members to discuss, supplement, and revise, so that the small-scale plan is built on the basis of mass consciousness, and every cadre and commune member clearly knows what agricultural work there is in these seven days, who will do it, what it should look like, and when it will be completed, etc.
　　In more than a month of practical work after formulating the small-scale production plan, the Third Production Brigade deeply realized that the formulation of the small-scale plan played a great role in doing a good job in the current production work. They summarized five major benefits: (1) It can rationally organize and use the labor force according to the agricultural season and the specific situation of current agricultural production, and assign various different labor forces to the specific tasks of various regular and rush production and service industries, give full play to the role of the existing labor force, and complete various production tasks in a timely manner. For example, the brigade's more than 1,500 mu of wheat fields and rapeseed fields have been universally top-dressed twice through the arrangement of the small-scale plan, and the wheat and rapeseed seedlings are growing vigorously. Public welfare undertakings and sideline production are also carried out in an organized and orderly manner. (2) It has changed the chaotic phenomenon of team leaders assigning work, group leaders calling workers, and temporary assignment of workers. Cadres have a clear understanding of the current agricultural work. Many cadres reflected on the benefits of the small-scale plan, saying: "A thousand-pound burden is carried by everyone, everyone has a goal in working, no need to assign or shout, the plan is thoughtful and the order is good." (3) It has further exerted the initiative and enthusiasm of commune members. Commune members no longer wait for work assignments, but consciously take the initiative to complete the division of labor according to the seven-day small-scale plan. Commune members reflected: "With a small-scale plan, the work for seven days is clear, and production is on track." A person named Zhang Gentu compiled a jingle and sang: "Small-scale plan is not well arranged, the day's production is not known; small-scale plan is made, daily agricultural work is well done." (4) Labor efficiency has been greatly improved. After the formulation of the small-scale plan, labor efficiency throughout the brigade has generally increased by more than 30%. When the Third Production Team carried out winter irrigation of the three wheat crops, fifteen laborers could only irrigate 60 mu of land a day. Now, the same number of laborers irrigate 80 mu of land a day, increasing work efficiency by 33%. (5) At the end of each small-scale plan, through comparison, each commune member's performance is recorded in the attendance book, which becomes the basis for monthly evaluation of "three good" commune members and quarterly evaluation of wage grades and rewards. At the same time, the completion of each small-scale plan becomes a reliable guarantee for the completion of the stage (quarterly) plan.

### 抓住小计划　实现大计划  望亭公社制订小段生产计划，田间管理大大加强

    抓住小计划　实现大计划
    望亭公社制订小段生产计划，田间管理大大加强
    本报南京14日电　江苏省吴县望亭人民公社最近在整顿经营管理工作中，首先把小段生产计划恢复和发展起来。这个公社第三大队从去年12月中旬以来，由于制订了小段生产计划，干部和社员对当前的各项生产任务都做到人人心中有数，个个有明确目标，有效地加强了当前越冬作物的管理。
    第三生产大队是在公社化时由原来三个小社合并建立起来的。在农业生产更大跃进的形势下，这个大队在前些时候虽然制订了年度和季度的生产计划，但没有制订小段生产计划，出现了干部事务忙乱，天天派工喊工和临时抽人等现象。干部对每天、每几天和每一段时间内干什么活？什么人去干？往往心中无数。社员也缺乏明确分工，做完这样等那样，劳动效率不高。
    大队总支在这次整顿经营管理中，为了使生产秩序更加有条不紊，先后召开生产队长、劳动组长会议和社员会议，从总结公社化以来的成绩和前一阶段生产入手，研究制订小段计划，并组织干部社员就要不要制订小段计划，制订小段计划有什么好处等问题，进行充分的讨论，小段计划便迅速在全大队推开。
    第三生产大队的小段计划都以生产队为单位制订，一般是七天制订一次，到目前为止，已制订了三次。具体做法是：各个生产队根据公社和大队的统一计划和对目前生产的要求，按照本队当前各项生产任务的具体情况，分别轻重缓急，计算出每个生产项目用工量和所需要的时间。具体进行三个站队——农活站队，劳力站队，完成任务的数量、质量和时间站队，做到因农活定劳力，因劳力强弱、技术高低定工作量，因农活要求定质量，并分别主次，全面照顾。
    小段计划方案订出后，都召开社员会议，充分发扬民主，发动社员讨论、补充和修正，使小段计划建筑在群众自觉的基础上，使每个干部和社员都明确知道在这七天中有些什么农活，什么人去干，干到什么样子，什么时候完成，等等。
    第三生产大队在制订小段生产计划后的一个多月实际工作中，深深体会到制订小段计划对做好当前的生产工作起了很大作用。他们归纳有五大好处：（一）能够按照农事季节和当前农业生产的具体情况，合理组织和使用劳力，把各种不同劳力，安排到各项经常性、突击性的生产和服务性行业的具体任务中去，充分发挥现有劳力的作用，及时完成各项生产任务。例如这个大队的一千五百多亩麦田、油菜田，通过小段计划的安排，现已普遍追肥二次，麦苗、油菜苗生长旺盛。公共福利事业、副业生产等也都搞的有条有理。（二）改变了队长派工、组长喊工、临时派工等事务忙乱现象。干部对当前的各项农活都心中有数。许多干部反映小段计划的好处说：“千斤担子众人挑，人人干活有目标，不要派工不要喊，计划周到秩序好。”（三）进一步发挥了社员的主动性和积极性，社员再也不等候派工喊工了，都是自觉地按照七天小段计划的分工，主动去完成。社员反映说：
  “有了小段计划，七天的活儿清清楚楚，生产上了路。”有一个名叫张根土的编了一个顺口溜唱道：“小段计划不排好，当天生产不知道；小段计划订出来，天天农活做周到。”（四）大大提高了劳动效率。全大队在制订小段计划后，劳动效率普遍提高30％以上。第三生产队在进行三麦冬灌时，以前十五个劳动力一天只能浇水六十亩。现在，同等数量劳力一天浇水八十亩，提高工效33％。（五）在每个小段计划完成时，通过评比，将每个社员的表现都记入考勤簿上，成为每月评选“三好”社员和季度评工资等级和奖励时的依据。同时，每个小段计划的完成，又成为完成阶段
  （季度）计划的可靠保证。
