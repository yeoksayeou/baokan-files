Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th. From December 20th to January 3rd, the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a national on-site conference on large machine tools in Chongqing. The conference studied the direction and tasks of machine tool production this year. The conference pointed out that this year, the mechanical industry will manufacture equipment for infrastructure projects in power, metallurgy, chemical, petroleum, transportation, and other sectors, which requires a variety of large machine tools. Therefore, the machine tool industry, especially the large machine tool industry, must implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs, vigorously and proportionally developing, and strengthen collaboration and coordination from the perspective of "the whole country as one chessboard," in order to catch up and meet the needs of the leap-forward development of various sectors of the national economy. The conference also determined the national manufacturing tasks for large machine tools this year.

At the meeting, more than 1,200 representatives from 429 units across the country, based on the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarized and exchanged experiences in the machine tool manufacturing industry, especially in the manufacturing of large machine tools, in combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs last year.

After visiting six sites, including the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory and the Chongqing Bearing Factory, which have done a good job in implementing the two-pronged approach and manufacturing indigenous and simple equipment, and the Chongqing Municipal Exhibition of Indigenous and Simple Equipment, and listening to the typical experience presentations of more than ten factories in Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and other places, the representatives deeply realized that in addition to using "foreign" methods to manufacture machine tools, a large number of indigenous and simple equipment to arm themselves is an indispensable aspect of rapidly developing the machine tool industry, especially the large machine tool industry.

The representatives believed that one of the outstanding experiences in vigorously developing indigenous and simple equipment by implementing the two-pronged approach last year was the use of cement to manufacture machine tools. In this regard, the achievements of the Chongqing Machinery Factory are relatively outstanding. The representatives believed that the successful experience of Chongqing and other regions in using cement to manufacture large machine tools has found a fast path for developing the large machine tool industry. Because using cement to make large parts to manufacture large machine tools does not require building large factories or manufacturing large equipment, and at the same time saves a lot of time for sand casting of main parts, saving a lot of steel, so that existing general factories can manufacture large machine tools.

The representatives believed that another noteworthy experience in implementing the two-pronged approach and vigorously developing indigenous and simple equipment last year was the modular machine tools successfully designed by seven machinery factories in Shenyang. This kind of machine tool is a relatively advanced product developed from vigorously developing indigenous and simple equipment. It uses a batch of relatively precise standard parts to assemble a variety of machine tools with different performances, which can adapt to various different processing objects and can replace large machine tools to process heavy products.

In order to ensure the completion of the heavy task of manufacturing large machine tools this year, Li Yu, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, pointed out at the meeting that all factories must pass five tests: First, the quantity and variety of products. Under the principle of proportional development, the quantity and variety of regular and precise products must be greatly increased. Second, the "heavy, large, precise, and cutting-edge" test. "Heavy, large, precise, and cutting-edge" products are products that mark my country's industrial level and drive technological development, and are also urgently needed by many important sectors of the national economy. This year, many products that catch up with and exceed the international level must be successfully trial-produced and put into production. Third, the product quality test. It is necessary to combine breaking superstitions and simplifying product structures with scientific experiments and research to ensure the stability and improvement of product quality. Fourth, the collaboration test. Fifth, the arming oneself test. Li Yu pointed out that in order to pass these five tests and ensure the overall leap forward of the machine tool industry, all factories must put politics in command, continue to break superstitions, and emancipate their minds; they must launch mass movements, make technical revolutions, and conscientiously implement the "three combinations"; they must take both indigenous and foreign methods and walk on two legs. In specific work, the first thing to do is to grasp the work of heat processing, and to make a great leap forward in the current weak casting and forging work; second, organize new processes and create new production lines; third, improve product quality and increase the wear resistance of machine tool surfaces; fourth, increase the output per unit area and organize large-scale bumper harvests; fifth, organize forces to overcome material fortresses and try every means to overcome material difficulties.

During the meeting, the First Ministry of Machine Building also held a meeting of directors and bureau chiefs of all provinces and cities across the country, focusing on discussing the collaborative supporting work of national machine tool production. (Attached picture)

    满足制造电力、冶金、化工、石油、交通设备的需要
    多多生产大型精密机床
    大型机床现场会议强调从全局出发加强协作
    据新华社重庆6日电　第一机械工业部12月20日到1月3日在重庆召开了全国大型机床现场会议。会议研究了今年机床生产的方向和任务。会议指出，今年机械工业为电力、冶金、化工、石油、交通运输等基建工程项目制造设备中，需要多种大型机床，因此机床工业特别是大型机床工业必须贯彻土洋并举、两条腿走路的方针，大力地按比例地发展，从“全国一盘棋”的观点出发，统筹安排，加强协作配合，以迎头赶上和满足国民经济各部门飞跃发展的需要。会议并且确定了今年全国大型机床的制造任务。
    会上，来自全国四百二十九个单位的一千二百多名代表根据中共八届六中全会的精神，总结交流了去年机床制造工业、特别是大型机床制造方面的土洋并举、两条腿走路的经验。
    代表们在参观了贯彻两条腿走路、制造土简设备好的重庆空气压缩机厂、重庆轴承厂等六个现场，和重庆市土简设备展览会，听了重庆、上海、沈阳、武汉等地十多个工厂的典型经验介绍以后，深刻体会到除了用“洋”办法制造机床以外，大量制造土简设备武装自己，是迅速发展机床工业、特别是大型机床工业不可缺少的一个方面。
    代表们认为，去年贯彻两条腿走路大搞土简设备中，突出的经验之一是采用水泥来制造机床。在这方面，重庆市机械工厂的成就是比较出色的。代表们认为，重庆和其他地区用水泥制造大型机床的成功经验，为发展大型机床工业找到了一条快速的道路。因为用水泥做大件制造大型机床，不需要建设大厂房，制造大设备，同时省去了大批主件的翻砂铸造时间，节省了大量钢铁，这样就使现有一般工厂都能制造出大型机床来。
    代表们认为，去年贯彻两条腿走路、大搞土简设备中另一值得注意的经验，是沈阳七个机械厂设计成功的拼合机床。这种机床是从大搞土简设备中发展起来的比较高级的产品，是用一批比较精密的标准件拼合成多种不同性能的机床，可以适应各种不同的加工对象，可以代替大型机床来加工重型产品。
    为了保证完成今年制造大型机床的繁重任务，第一机械工业部副部长黎玉在会上指出，各厂必须过好五关：第一，产品数量和品种关。要在按比例发展的原则下，大量增加正规的精密的产品的数量和品种。第二，“重、大、精、尖”关。“重、大、精、尖”的产品，是标志着我国工业水平和带动技术发展的产品，也是国民经济许多重要部门迫切需要的产品，今年必须将赶上和超过国际水平的许多产品试制成功，并投入生产。第三，产品质量关。必须使破除迷信、简化产品结构与科学试验研究相结合，保证稳定和提高产品的质量。第四，协作关。第五，武装自己关。黎玉指出，为了过好这五关，保证机床工业全面跃进，各厂必须政治挂帅，继续破除迷信，解放思想；要大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，认真实行“三结合”；要土洋并举两条腿走路。在具体的工作上，首先要抓热加工的工作，要使目前薄弱的铸工和锻工工作来个很大的跃进；第二，组织新工艺，搞出新的生产线；第三，提高产品质量，增加机床床面的耐磨性；第四，提高单位面积产量，组织大面积丰收；第五，组织力量攻克材料堡垒，千方百计地克服材料困难。
    会议期间，第一机械工业部还召开了全国各省、市的厅局长会议，着重讨论了全国机床生产的协作配套工作。（附图片）
