    Loess Can Be Used to Make Glass
    Liu Shutang of the Shanghai Bulb Factory has recently successfully experimented with using loess to replace quartz sand in the manufacture of glass.
    Liu Shutang is the director of the factory's glass workshop. During the mass steelmaking campaign, he led the workshop's employees to actively participate in low-temperature steelmaking. During steelmaking, he discovered that the blue bricks lining the furnace dissolved like glass liquid at a high temperature of over 1,300 degrees Celsius. This made him wonder if he could use loess, the raw material for making blue bricks, to make glass. He immediately took workers such as Liu Guqing to construction sites to dig up loess and put it into the glass melting furnace for testing. With the support of the Party committee, they finally succeeded in trial production. After鉴定 (assessment/appraisal), the mechanical strength of this glass is 4% higher than the original bulb glass and lighter than ordinary glass. They used loess to make glass, producing glass tubes, glass rods, commonly used light bulbs, glass fibers, and other various glass products.

    黄土可造玻璃
    上海灯泡厂刘树棠最近试验成功用黄土代替石英砂制造玻璃。
    刘树棠是这个厂玻璃车间的主任。在全民炼钢运动中，他带动车间职工积极参加了低温炼钢。他在炼钢当中发现，垫在炉膛内的青砖在摄氏一千三百多度高温下，溶化得同玻璃液体一样。于是他就想能不能用制造青砖的原料黄土来制造玻璃呢？他马上跟工人刘古清等一起到建筑工地上挖黄土，放在玻璃熔池里试验起来。在党委的支持下，终于试制成功了。经过鉴定，这种玻璃的机械强度比原来灯泡玻璃强度还高4％，比一般玻璃轻。他们用黄土制成的玻璃，提制出玻管玻梗、普通用的灯泡，以及玻璃纤维和其他各种玻璃制品。
