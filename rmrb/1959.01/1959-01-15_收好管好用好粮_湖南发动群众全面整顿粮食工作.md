Collect, Manage, and Use Grain Well

Hunan Mobilizes the Masses to Comprehensively Rectify Grain Work

(本报讯) This newspaper reports: Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province are vigorously mobilizing the masses to inspect grain storage, check accounts, examine planned grain use, and review the final stages of harvesting, launching a "three goods" movement to collect, manage, and use the fruits of the bumper harvest well.

Hunan Province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain in 1958. A few cadres at one time developed the harmful sentiment that "with a bumper harvest, it doesn't matter if we waste a little." Isolated places saw phenomena such as grain being discarded during harvesting, grain rotting in warehouses, and unclear grain counts and confused procedures. Based on the instructions of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, various localities promptly mobilized the masses to carry out a major inspection of grain, adopting the method of inspecting while sunning, handling dangerous grain, and establishing systems for grain use and storage to comprehensively inspect and rectify grain work.

After a comprehensive inspection and on-the-spot debate on the collection, sunning, management, storage, and seed retention of grain in the Daweishan People's Commune of Liuyang County in late November last year, all dangerous grain was handled, and more than 10,000 dan of late rice that had been piled up outside for more than a month was also brought into the warehouse. The commune also simultaneously established a responsibility system for storage and a system of grain use accounts. Two hundred and forty-eight custodians were selected and one hundred and eighty-nine warehouse protection groups were established, ensuring that warehouses were managed and grain use was planned. According to statistics from December 10 last year, eighty-eight counties and cities across the province had generally surveyed more than 4 billion catties of grain stored in state warehouses. After inspection and appraisal, about 94% of the grain met the "four withouts" standard of being free of insects, mildew, rodents, and accidents. Because after the grain organizations in various localities were decentralized to the people's communes, the grassroots grain cadres, under the unified leadership of the local party committee, mobilized the masses and adopted the method of "walking on two legs," grasped both state grain and commune grain, and stored them separately. Sixty-nine counties and cities across the province inspected more than 7.7 billion catties of grain stored in the people's communes, and most of them basically met the "four withouts" standard.

While inspecting the granaries, all localities also generally inspected the implementation of planned grain use and economical grain use. After the CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee launched a major debate among the people of the entire region on "Is it necessary to conserve during a bumper harvest and is planned grain use good?", public canteens throughout the region generally implemented planned grain use and a system of quantitative rationing. After the implementation of planned grain use throughout the region, according to statistics from only four counties including Shaoyang, more than 50,000 catties of grain were saved. By early December, out of more than 230,000 public canteens in the province, 220,000 canteens had realized planned grain use after inspection and rectification, accounting for about 92% of the total number of public canteens in the province.

### 收好管好用好粮  湖南发动群众全面整顿粮食工作

    收好管好用好粮
    湖南发动群众全面整顿粮食工作
    本报讯　湖南省各级党委正大力发动群众，查粮食保管、查账目，查计划用粮和查收割煞尾工作，开展把丰收果实收好、管好、用好的“三好”运动。
    1958年湖南粮食获得空前大丰收。少数干部一度滋长着“丰收了，浪费一点没有关系”的有害情绪。个别地方曾出现收割中丢撒粮食、仓库霉烂粮食和粮数不清、手续混乱等现象。各地根据中共湖南省委的指示，及时发动群众开展了粮食大检查，采取边检查、边翻晒、边处理危粮、边建立用粮和保管等制度的办法，全面检查整顿粮食工作。
    浏阳县大围山人民公社在去年11月下旬对全社粮食的收、晒、管、藏和留种工作，进行一次全面大检查和现场辩论以后，处理了全部危粮，并把一万多担堆在外面一个多月的晚稻谷也收进了仓。这个社还同时建立了保管责任制和用粮账表制度，还选出二百四十八个保管员，成立了一百八十九个护仓小组，做到了粮仓有人管，用粮有计划。据去年12月10日统计，全省八十八个县市已普查国家仓库的四十多亿斤存粮，经过检查鉴定，其中约有94％的粮食达到了无虫、无霉烂、无鼠雀、无事故的“四无”标准。由于各地粮食机构下放到人民公社后，基层粮食干部在当地党委统一领导下，发动群众，采取“两条腿走路”的办法，把国家粮食和公社存粮统一抓起来，分别保管好。全省六十九个县、市检查人民公社七十七亿多斤存粮，也大部分基本上达到了“四无”标准。
    各地在检查粮仓的同时，普遍检查了计划用粮和节约用粮的执行情况。中共邵阳地委发动全区人民开展了一次“丰收要不要节约和计划用粮好不好”的大辩论后，全区公共食堂普遍实行了用粮计划化、定量制度化。全区实现计划用粮后，仅据邵阳等四县的统计，就节约粮食五万多斤。到12月上旬止，全省二十三万多个公共食堂，经过检查整顿，已有二十二万个食堂实现了计划用粮，约占全省公共食堂总数92％。
