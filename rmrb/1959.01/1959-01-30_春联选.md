Spring Couplets Selection

	Drums and gongs fill the sky, celebrating the leap forward in grain and cotton production.
	Songs resound everywhere, rejoicing in the overfulfillment of steel tasks.

	Both red and expert, political and professional, a double leap forward.
	Half work, half study, production and learning, both yielding bountiful harvests.

	The canteen skillfully cooks meals for thousands of families.
	The commune provides warmth and sustenance for tens of thousands of hearts.

	Molten iron flows, singing of the Great Leap Forward.
	Hearts bloom with joy, celebrating the bumper harvest.

	Leap Forward songs, Leap Forward dances, singing and dancing the Leap Forward.
	Bumper Harvest poems, Bumper Harvest paintings, poetry and paintings of the Bumper Harvest.

	Spring returns to the earth; ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains are like brocade.
	Giant dragons fly and dance; six hundred million Shenzhou are all like Emperors Yao and Shun.

	Coming and going, smiles bloom, everyone is satisfied.
	Picking and choosing, colors and patterns are complete, every item is satisfactory.
