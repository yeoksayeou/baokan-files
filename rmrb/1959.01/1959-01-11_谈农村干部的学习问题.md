    On the Study Problems of Rural Cadres
    Huang Yu

    I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Tian Jiaying's article "Making Study a Routine in Our Lives" (see page 8 of this newspaper, January 8th). This article is aimed at机关 (Jiguan) cadres. I think that learning should not only become a routine in the lives of every 机关 (Jiguan) cadre, but also should become a routine in the lives of each of us. Here, I will talk about the learning problems of rural cadres.

    Last year, I was sent to work in a village and came into contact with some township and commune cadres. I think they have many advantages, the most prominent of which are: they resolutely implement the resolutions of the higher-level Party committee without bargaining; they are very motivated, sometimes to the point of forgetting to eat and sleep. However, some of them are relatively lax in their studies. They rarely read books or newspapers. They often say, "We don't even have enough time for production, how can we have time to read books and newspapers?" "We can still work without studying." As a result, they have lost the good opportunity to regularly learn the Party's policies from books and newspapers.

    Not reading books and newspapers often prevents them from directly learning the central government's policies and advanced experiences from other places, thus making them more creative in their work. Not studying Marxism-Leninism also makes their vision shallow, short-sighted, and opaque, and their thinking is not broad enough.

    Last year was a year of great leap forward. In rural areas, production tasks were tight and numerous, and the labor force was insufficient. In this case, it is understandable that there was not enough time for learning. But now, after last year's great leap forward, we have gained some experience in the "one horse takes the lead, ten thousand horses gallop" style of work, and the work can gradually enter a normal state without being so hectic. Moreover, under normal circumstances, it is entirely possible to study for one or two hours a day. Therefore, the issue of learning should also be included in the daily schedule of our rural cadres.

    Most of our grassroots cadres have high revolutionary enthusiasm and rich experience in class struggle and production struggle, which is where they are stronger than intellectuals. But if we are only satisfied with the existing experience, those without culture do not learn culture; those with culture do not study the Party's policies and do not study Marxism-Leninism, as Chairman Mao said, it is also very dangerous ("On Correcting Unhealthy Tendencies in Party Style", same below). Because this kind of knowledge "is biased towards perceptual or partial, lacking rational knowledge and universal knowledge", "and to do a good job in the revolutionary cause, it is impossible without relatively complete knowledge."

    The conditions, content, and methods of learning for rural cadres certainly cannot be exactly the same as those for机关 (Jiguan) cadres. A considerable part of our current rural cadres have no culture or have a low level of culture. They must first learn culture and improve their cultural level. And regardless of whether they are cultured or not, they should be organized to read books and newspapers, to learn the central government's policies, the advanced experience of other places, and to understand major events at home and abroad.

    Our Party has always advocated that people with book knowledge learn from practice. In recent years, a large number of intellectuals have gone to factories and the countryside. This policy will continue to be implemented in the future. Our Party has also always advocated that people with practical experience learn from books, because this can make experience more systematic and comprehensive, and rise to theory, so as to better guide practice. Recently, the masses of workers and peasants in many places have launched a mass movement to study theory. Among the people who were previously considered "crude," worker-philosophers and peasant-philosophers have emerged. After studying theory, they said: "Our thinking has opened up and we see farther." There are more ways to work, and work efficiency has also been significantly improved. Facts have proved that theory is not so mysterious and difficult to learn for workers, peasants, and cadres. There are still some comrades with practical experience who have not done so, so it is still necessary to publicize it to them.

    Let learning become a routine in the lives of each of us!

    谈农村干部的学习问题
    黄郁
    田家英同志写的“使学习成为我们的生活常规”一文（见1月8日本报八版），我举双手表示赞成。他这篇文章是针对机关干部写的，我以为，学习不仅应该成为每个机关干部的生活常规，而且，应该成为我们每个人的生活常规。这里，我谈谈农村干部的学习问题。
    去年，我下放在一个村里，接触了一些乡、社干部。我觉得他们的优点很多，其中最突出的是：执行上级党委决议，坚决而不讲任何价钱；干劲大，有时候真是废寝忘食。但他们之中有些同志在学习上却比较放松，他们很少看书看报。他们常说：“生产还来不及，哪有工夫看书看报？”“不学习，也照样工作。”结果，他们就失去了经常从书报上学习党的方针政策的好机会。
    不看书不看报，使他们往往不能从书报上直接学习中央的方针政策、学习别地的先进经验，从而更富于创造性地来进行工作。不学习马列主义理论，也使他们的眼光看得不深不远不透，思想不够开阔。
    去年是大跃进的一年，在农村里，生产任务紧而且多，劳动力又不足，在这种情况下，抽不出较多的时间学习，是可以理解的现象。但现在，经过去年的大跃进，对于“一马当先，万马奔腾”式的各项工作已经有了一定的经验了，工作可以不那样忙乱而逐渐进入正常了，而且，在一般情况下，每天学习一、二个小时，是完全可能的。因此，学习问题也应该订入我们农村干部的生活日程上来了。
    我们的基层干部，大多数革命热情高，具有丰富的阶级斗争经验和生产斗争经验，这是他们比知识分子强的地方。但如果仅仅满足于已有的经验，没文化的，不学习文化；有文化的，不学习党的政策，不学习马列主义理论，正如毛主席所说，那也很危险（“整顿党的作风”，下同）。因为这种知识“是偏于感性的或局部的，缺乏理性的知识和普遍的知识”，“而要把革命事业做好，没有比较完全的知识是不行的。”
    农村干部学习的条件内容和方法，当然不能和机关干部完全一样。我们现在的农村干部，还有相当一部分没有文化，或者文化较低。他们必须首先学文化、提高文化程度。而不论有文化的、没文化的，都应该组织他们看书读报，从书报上学习中央的政策、别地的先进经验，了解国内外大事。
    我们党一向提倡有书本知识的人向实际学习。近年来，大批知识分子下厂下乡。这方针以后还会贯彻。我们党也一向提倡有实际经验的人向书本学习，因为这可以使经验带上条理性、综合性，上升为理论，从而能更好地指导实践。近来，不少地方的工农群众，已经展开了群众性的学习理论运动了。在过去被认为是“大老粗”的人之中，出现了工人哲学家、农民哲学家。学习理论后，他们说：“思想开了，看的远了。”工作办法多了，工作效率也有显著的提高。事实证明，理论对于工农群众和工农干部，也并不是那样神秘而难学的。现在还有些有实际经验的同志，还没有这样作，所以，也还有必要向他们宣传宣传。
    让学习成为我们每个人的生活常规吧！
