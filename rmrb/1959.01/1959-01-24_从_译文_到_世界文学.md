From "Translation" to "World Literature"

"Translation" has been renamed "World Literature" from the January issue of this year with a revamped content. The publication is more closely integrated with the times, the reviews are strengthened, and the coverage is broadened.

This issue contains translations of some works and critical articles by Soviet writers, and continues to report on the "Doctor Zhivago" issue. One article introduces and criticizes the novel and its author, Pasternak, through analysis. It turns out that after the October Revolution, the author's father and two sisters fled abroad. Although he did not escape, he became a thorough "domestic White Russian" in his thoughts and feelings. The dominant ideas in his early works were religious mysticism, individualism, and detachment from reality. His early poems already showed dissatisfaction with reality, and Gorky pointed out the confusion and lack of ideology in his poems in a letter.

The strengthening of critical work is reflected in the newly added column "Analysis of Modern Works," which this time publishes three articles reviewing the Soviet novel "Baltic Sky" and Japanese female writer Yamadai Ba's "Cart Song." The achievements and negative factors of the classic literary work "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," such as the pessimistic mood and fatalistic shortcomings in the work, are also analyzed.

The good traditions of "Translation," such as the unconventional size, the cover and insert introductions to foreign art works, and the columns such as "Foreign Book News" and "World Literary Trends," have been retained. In addition, the newly added columns "New Book Reviews" and "Biographies of Writers" make it more vivid and diverse.

It is particularly worth mentioning that "World Literature" organizes Chinese writers to write critical articles, which makes it easier to discuss issues in light of China's actual situation. (De)

### 从“译文”到“世界文学”

    从“译文”到“世界文学”
    “译文”从今年1月号起革新内容改名为“世界文学”。刊物和时代结合得紧密了，评论加强了，报道方面广泛了。
    这一期译载了苏联作家的一些作品和评论文章，还继续报道了有关“日瓦戈医生”的问题。有一篇文章边分析、边批判地介绍了这部小说和它的作者帕斯捷尔纳克。原来在十月革命后，这位作者的父亲和两个姊妹就都逃亡国外，他虽未逃亡，但在思想感情上却成为不折不扣的“国内白俄”。他初期创作的主导思想就是宗教神秘主义、个人主义、脱离现实的。早期诗作中也已经表现了对现实的不满，高尔基早在一封信中曾一针见血地指出过他诗歌中的混乱和无思想性。
    评论工作的加强，表现在新增辟了“现代作品分析”这一栏，这次一共发表了评介苏联小说“波罗的海天空”和日本女作家山代巴的“板车之歌”等三篇文章。对于古典文学作品“德伯家的苔丝”的成就和消极因素，如作品中的悲观情绪和宿命论等缺点也都作了分析。
    “译文”的好传统，如开本不一般化，封面和插页介绍外国美术作品，以及“国外书讯”、“世界文艺动态”等栏目都保留了下来，再加上新添的“新书短评”、“作家小传”等栏目，更显得生动多样。
    特别值得一提的是“世界文学”组织了我国作家写评论文章，这样就更容易结合中国的实际来谈问题。　（德）
