Tanganyika is located in the southern part of the East African Plateau, bordering the Indian Ocean to the east. It is currently a British "trust territory." Its area is 969,000 square kilometers, and its population is about 8.75 million, most of whom are of African Bantu descent, with a small proportion of Asians.

After the Germans invaded Tanganyika in 1884, they renamed it German East Africa in 1890. Germany was defeated in World War I, and Tanganyika was placed under British rule in the name of a "League of Nations" "mandate." After World War II, the United Nations Trusteeship Council passed a resolution in December 1946 to hand Tanganyika over to British "trusteeship." Britain deliberately enslaved Tanganyika for a long time, attempting to merge it with Uganda and Kenya into an "East African Federation."

Tanganyika's main products include sisal, coffee, cotton, and leather. The mineral resources here are also very rich, including diamonds, gold, tin, and mica. However, under the greedy plunder and cruel exploitation of Western colonialists, the people of Tanganyika live a very miserable life. In 1955, a United Nations report pointed out that there was racial discrimination in Tanganyika, and the lives of the local people were very miserable...

The people of Tanganyika are constantly fighting for national independence. Recently, Mr. Bok Mounak, head of the Tanganyika delegation to the All-African People's Conference, said, "We are not begging for freedom. Freedom is our natural right, and if we are not given freedom, we will use force to obtain it."

    坦噶尼喀
    坦噶尼喀位于东非高原之南，东临印度洋，现为英国“托管地”。它的面积为九十六万九千平方公里，人口约八百七十五万，其中大部分是非洲的班图族血统，还有一部分亚洲人。
    德国人在1884年侵入坦噶尼喀后，在1890年把它改称为德属东非。第一次世界大战中德国战败，坦噶尼喀以“国际联盟”“委任”的名义归英国统治。第二次世界大战后，联合国托管理事会又在1946年12月通过决议将坦噶尼喀交给英国“托管”。英国蓄意长期奴役坦噶尼喀，企图把它和乌干达、怯尼亚合并为“东非联邦”。
    坦噶尼喀的主要产品有西沙尔麻、咖啡、棉花和皮革等。这里的矿产也很丰富，有钻石、金、锡和云母等。但是，在西方殖民者的贪婪掠夺和残酷剥削下，坦噶尼喀人民过着非常悲惨的生活。1955年，联合国报告中指出，坦噶尼喀存在着种族歧视，当地人民生活非常悲惨……。
    坦噶尼喀人民为争取民族独立不断地进行着斗争。最近坦噶尼喀出席全非人民大会代表团团长博克·穆纳克说，“我们并不是在乞求自由。自由是我们天生的权利，如果不给予我们自由，我们将用武力来取得它。”
