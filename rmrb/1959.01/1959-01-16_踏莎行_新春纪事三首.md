To the Tune of "Ta Sha Xing"
Three Poems on New Year's Events
Ye Shengtao

	The year's cycle renews, the east wind flourishes, and great joyful news suddenly arrives from the heavens. The Soviet rocket ascends to the highest clouds, its orbit eternally alongside the starry host. The universe is boundless, and minute details can be observed; a planet crafted by hand, not a myth. From the creation of the world until now, space is only beginning to be made by man.
	Imagining the future, with careful research as the basis, spaceships will soar high in an instant, far from the Earth into the vast expanse, free to come and go in the boundless universe. To roam the moon, to briefly reside on Mars, to gaze upon meteor showers from the window. Humanity expands to the stars; the Soviet Union's great achievement blazes a trail.
	The Congo's storm, the emotions of Africa, like reeds and rushes ablaze, who can restrain them? Awakening, the continent stands tall, and colonialism is a rat scurrying across the street. Puppets collapse, Cuba is autonomous, countless are the auspicious New Year tidings. May I ask, are the paper tigers' dreams shattered? The world will have no place to accommodate you!

    踏莎行
    新春纪事三首
    叶圣陶
    岁序新更，东风盛发，乍传喜事天来大。苏联火箭上层霄，运行永并群星驾。宇宙无垠，奥微能察，行星手造非神话。鸿蒙开辟到如今，太空始欲人工化。凝想将来，精研有据，飞船一霎高高举，遥离大地入长空，茫茫宇宙任来去。月里遨游，火星小住，当窗饱看流星雨。人间扩大到星间，苏联伟绩开先路。刚果风云，非洲情绪，如荼如火谁能御？觉来大陆挺胸膛，殖民主义过街鼠。傀儡坍台，古巴自主，新年佳讯还堪数。问他纸虎梦醒乎，世将无地能容汝！
