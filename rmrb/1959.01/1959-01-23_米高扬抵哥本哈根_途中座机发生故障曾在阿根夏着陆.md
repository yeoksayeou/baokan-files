    Mikoyan Arrives in Copenhagen
    Plane Malfunctioned En Route, Forced to Land in Argentia
    Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, January 22nd: TASS reports from Copenhagen that First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Mikoyan, arrived in Copenhagen today on his way home from a visit to the United States.
    Mikoyan plans to stay in Copenhagen for one day.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS reports from New York on January 21st that First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Mikoyan, and his entourage flew from New York to Moscow on January 20th aboard a "Douglas-7" four-engine passenger plane. One of the engines malfunctioned during the flight from New York to Newfoundland. The captain announced that the plane would be forced to land at Gander Airport, which is on an international air route.
    Soon, a second engine also failed. Therefore, the captain changed his decision and announced that he would land at the nearest Argentia military airport (Newfoundland, Canada). It landed safely in Argentia at approximately 10:00 AM local time that day.
    It is reported that another four-engine plane had already flown to Argentia on the 21st. Mikoyan and his entourage boarded this plane at around 22:00 Moscow time on the twenty-second towards Copenhagen.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: TASS reports from Washington that US President Eisenhower said at a press conference on January 21st that Mikoyan's talks with US national leaders were to gain a clear understanding of existing problems in US-Soviet relations. Eisenhower said these talks should not be seen as negotiations but as a mutual explanation of the reasons underlying each country's position on many international issues.
    Eisenhower said that no new proposals were made during Mikoyan's meetings with US national leaders.
    When asked how he would treat the possibility of Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union, Eisenhower said he believed that any mutual visits by prominent figures are a good thing.

    途中座机发生故障曾在阿根夏着陆
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社哥本哈根讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在访美归国途中于今天到达哥本哈根。
    米高扬计划在哥本哈根停留一天。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约21日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬和他的随行人员20日从纽约乘“道格拉斯—七”型四发动机客机飞往莫斯科。在纽约至纽芬兰途中，飞机上的一个发动机发生故障。机长宣布，飞机将被迫在国际航线所经过的甘德机场着陆。
    很快第二个发动机也坏了。因此机长改变了自己的决定，宣布将在最近的阿根夏军用机场（加拿大纽芬兰岛）降落。当天当地时间十时左右在阿根夏安全着陆。
    据报道，另一架四发动机飞机已经在21日飞抵阿根夏。米高扬和他的随行人员在莫斯科时间二十二时左右乘这架飞机向哥本哈根。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔21日在记者招待会上说，米高扬和美国国家领导人的会谈是为了取得对美苏关系现存的问题的明确看法。艾森豪威尔说，这些会谈不能看作是谈判，而应该看作是彼此解释两国在许多国际问题方面的立场所依据的理由。
    艾森豪威尔说，在米高扬同美国国家领导人会晤时没有提出任何新的建议。
    艾森豪威尔在回答他如何对待副总统尼克松访问苏联的可能性时说，他认为有名的人物的任何相互访问都是好事。
