Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th: How to manufacture more and better large and medium-sized rolling mills in the shortest possible time to equip the iron and steel industry? The National Rolling Mill Manufacturing Experience Exchange Meeting, convened by the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai from the 10th to the 14th of this month, focused on exchanging experiences in this area. More than 400 representatives from over 200 units across the country attended the meeting.

The meeting pointed out that the current rolling capacity cannot keep up with the growth rate of steel, and the quantity and variety of steel products cannot meet the needs of the machinery industry. It is necessary to vigorously increase steel production. Manufacturing rolling mill equipment has become the most urgent task for the machinery industry at present. The meeting believed that this year's required rolling mill varieties are numerous, and the quantity is large, with most of the equipment to be completed in the first half of the year, making the task very arduous. In order to ensure the completion of this task, it is currently necessary to successfully overcome the three hurdles of castings, processing, and complete sets.

The meeting believed that in the past period, various regions have achieved considerable accomplishments and accumulated experience in rolling mill production. In particular, the Party organizations in various regions have implemented the "walking on two legs" policy, relied on the masses, and created many methods to overcome the numerous difficulties in manufacturing rolling mills. For example, the Hengyang Metallurgical Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Hunan Province used a three-ton electric furnace to cast a 25-ton frame casting; the Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building used electroslag welding to "assemble small parts into large ones"; the experience of Harbin Machine Union, Qunli, and Shanghai Jingye, Hongxing, and Metallurgical machinery factories in manufacturing rolling mills using indigenous equipment were all introduced at the meeting.

The experience introduced by the Shanghai Jingye Machine Factory aroused great interest among the delegates. Under the leadership of the Party, this factory relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and basically completed a complete set of indigenous equipment for manufacturing rolling mills in just over ten days, forming an assembly line dedicated to the production of rolling mill equipment. These indigenous equipment are simple in structure, easy to use, and highly efficient. The most critical and difficult parts in manufacturing rolling mill equipment, such as "human" tooth gears, spline shaft grooves, and reduction gears, were all solved using simple indigenous equipment. From late November to now, in just over a month, this factory has already completed two sets of medium-sized rolling mills, and five more sets are under manufacture. The outstanding achievements of the Jingye Machine Factory gave the attending delegates great inspiration. It further dispelled the mysterious views of some factories on the manufacturing of rolling mills and corrected the past perception that rolling mill equipment is large, heavy, and complex, and that some parts require high precision, and cannot be manufactured by general factories without specialized equipment.

The meeting also pointed out that while vigorously producing large and medium-sized rolling mills in various regions, attention should also be paid to helping the development of small indigenous rolling mills in rural areas. The Macheng County No. 1 Machinery Factory in Hubei Province introduced its experience in manufacturing the "Commune" brand small indigenous rolling mill at the meeting.

The meeting also exchanged views on the problem of complete sets of rolling mill equipment. The meeting required industrial departments in various regions to pay great attention to the work of complete sets when organizing production to ensure that rolling mills are put into production on time.

### 制造又多又好的轧钢设备  一机部召开全国轧钢机制造经验交流会

    制造又多又好的轧钢设备
    一机部召开全国轧钢机制造经验交流会
    新华社上海16日电  如何在尽可能短的时间内制造出又多又好的大中型轧钢机，装备钢铁工业，第一机械工业部本月10日到14日在上海召开的全国轧钢机制造经验交流会议，着重交流了这方面的经验，出席这次会议的有来自全国各地的二百多个单位四百多名代表。
    会议指出，目前轧钢能力不能适应钢的增长速度，钢材的数量品种又不能满足机械工业需要，必须大力增产钢材。制造轧钢设备就成为机械工业当前一项最迫切的任务。会议认为，今年所需要的轧钢机品种多，数量大，大部分设备要在上半年完成，任务是很艰巨的。为了保证完成这一任务，当前必须过好铸件、加工和成套三个关。
    会议认为，过去一个时期，各地在轧钢机生产上已经取得不少成就和经验，尤其是各地党组织贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，依靠群众，创造了很多办法，突破了制造轧钢机的重重困难。像湖南衡阳冶金修造厂用三吨电炉浇铸二十五吨重的机架铸件，第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院用电渣焊“拼小为大”的方法；哈尔滨机联、群力和上海精业、红星、冶金等机械厂大造土设备制造轧钢机的经验，都在会上作了介绍。
    上海精业机器厂介绍的经验，引起了到会代表的极大兴趣。这个厂在党的领导下，依靠群众，发动群众，用十多天时间基本上搞成了制造轧钢机的全套土设备，组成了专门生产轧钢设备的流水生产线。这些土设备结构简单、使用方便、效率很高。制造轧钢设备最关键的也是最困难的“人”字齿轮、梅花轴槽、减速齿轮，都用简易的土设备解决了。从11月下旬到现在短短的一个多月中，这个厂已经完成了两套中型轧机，还有五套正在制造。精业机器厂的出色成就给到会代表很大启发，它进一步破除了有些工厂对制造轧钢机的神秘观点，纠正了过去认为轧钢设备大、重、复杂，有些部件精密度高，没有专用设备，一般工厂不能制造的看法。
    这次会议也指出，在各地大力赶制大中型轧机的同时，也应该注意帮助农村小土轧机的发展。湖北省麻城县第一机械厂在会上介绍了制造“公社”号小型土轧钢机的经验。
    这次会议对轧钢设备的配套问题，也交换了意见。会议要求各地工业主管部门在组织生产的时候，必须以极大的注意重视配套工作，保证轧钢机按时投入生产。
