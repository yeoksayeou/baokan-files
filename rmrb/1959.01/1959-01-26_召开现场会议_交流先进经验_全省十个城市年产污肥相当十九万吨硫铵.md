    This newspaper reports that, based on the characteristics of Liaoning Province having many industrial cities, dense populations, and a wide variety and large quantity of urban manure, the province has decided that urban construction, health, and agricultural departments should work closely together to vigorously organize urban feces, garbage, sewage, and other waste materials to "go to the countryside" for farmland fertilization, turning waste into treasure and serving agricultural production. In order to promote the comprehensive development of this work, the Liaoning Provincial Fertilizer and Petroleum Production Command, together with the Agricultural Department, the Health Department, the Construction Department, and the Water Conservancy Bureau, recently jointly convened an on-site conference on urban manure fertilizer and sewage irrigation in Fushun and Shenyang. The conference exchanged experiences in organizing and utilizing sewage and waste for farmland fertilization and arranged future work tasks.
    Participants in the meeting visited two sewage aqueduct projects built using local methods in Fushun City; learned from the experience of the Lishizhai Work Area of the Shangyou People's Commune in using sewage for winter irrigation; and visited the "earth-made" sewage sedimentation tank and the sewage power generation project of the Yangshi Work Area of the Sujiatun People's Commune in Shenyang City, as well as the garbage classification in Dadong District and the mixed composting of garbage and manure in Tiexi District. Through on-site visits and discussions, everyone recognized the great significance of organizing urban manure and waste to go to the countryside to support agricultural production, clarified the future direction of work, and learned the scientific methods of urban waste utilization and management.
    The meeting pointed out that the ten large and medium-sized industrial cities in Liaoning Province alone can produce more than 404 million tons of organic fertilizer annually from sewage, sludge, feces, various organic waste, and factory scraps. Calculated by fertilizer effect, this is equivalent to about 190,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, or 25.8 billion jin of earth manure. If used for agricultural production, it can fertilize 1.3 million mu of dry land or 600,000 mu of paddy fields, which can increase grain production by 760,000 tons, enough to feed 2.5 million people for a year.
    The meeting believes that in dealing with urban manure fertilizer and sewage issues, it is necessary to implement the policy of "serving production and serving the working people," and to comprehensively utilize resources based on the principles of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Urban waste utilization and management is a broad and complex task, and close cooperation between urban construction, health, and agricultural departments is key to doing this work well. In order to do a good job in urban waste utilization and management, the meeting required all cities to first ascertain the types and quantities of manure fertilizer, conduct comprehensive planning, train technical personnel in sanitation, fertilizer accumulation, and sewage testing, properly arrange transportation and manpower, and combine this with the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests and launch a large-scale urban manure-to-the-countryside movement.

    召开现场会议　交流先进经验
    全省十个城市年产污肥相当十九万吨硫铵
    本报讯　辽宁省根据工业城市多、人口密集和城粪品种繁多、数量大的特点，决定由城市建设、卫生、农业部门密切协作，大力组织城市粪便、垃圾、污水等污物“下乡”肥田，把废物变成宝物，为农业生产服务。为了推动这一工作全面开展，最近辽宁省肥料石油生产指挥部同农业厅、卫生厅、建设厅和水利局等部门，在抚顺、沈阳联合召开了城市粪肥、污水灌溉现场会议，交流了组织和利用污水、污物肥田的经验，布置了今后的工作任务。
    参加会议的人员参观了抚顺市用土法修建两处污水渡槽工程；学习了上游人民公社李石寨作业区利用污水冬灌的经验，参观了沈阳市苏家屯人民公社杨士作业区的“土”污水沉淀池和利用污水发电的工程，以及大东区的垃圾分类、铁西区利用垃圾粪便混合堆肥。通过现场参观和讨论，使大家都认识到组织城粪和污物下乡对支援农业生产的重大意义，明确了今后的工作方向，同时学到了城市污物利用和管理的科学方法。
    会议指出：辽宁省仅十个大中工业城市就可年产污水、污泥、粪便和各种有机垃圾、工厂下脚等有机肥四亿零四百多万吨，按肥效计算，可顶硫铵十九万吨左右，相当于二百五十八亿斤土粪。如果用于农业生产，可施旱田一百三十万亩，或水田六十万亩，能增产粮食七十六万吨，可供二百五十万人吃一年。
    会议认为，在处理城市粪肥、污水问题上，必须贯彻“为生产服务，为劳动人民服务”的方针，本着土洋结合、以土为主的多、快、好、省的原则加以综合利用。城市污物利用和管理是一项涉及面广而又复杂的工作，城市建设、卫生、农业部门密切协作，是做好这一工作的关键。为了做好城市污物利用和管理工作，会议要求各城市首先要摸清粪肥的种类和数量，进行全面规划，培训卫生、积肥和污水化验的技术力量，很好地安排运输力和人力，结合除四害讲卫生运动，开展大规模的城粪下乡运动。
