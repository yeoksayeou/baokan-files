Xinhua News Agency, Cleveland Dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan paid an extensive visit to Cleveland.

When Mikoyan arrived in Cleveland, American industrialist Eaton, who was at the airport to greet him, delivered a welcome speech, welcoming him to visit the state of Ohio.

Mikoyan first conveyed greetings from Khrushchev to Eaton. He pointed out that Eaton's recent visit to the Soviet Union demonstrated that people belonging to different social systems could establish harmonious relations and become friends under conditions of peaceful coexistence.

Mikoyan concluded by extending good wishes to the residents of Cleveland.

On the morning of the 7th, Mikoyan attended a banquet held at the "Union Club," attended by representatives from all industries in Ohio, local newspaper publishers, and public representatives.

At the banquet, Eaton congratulated the guest from the Soviet Union on the new and enormous achievements of Soviet science. He said that the whole world admires the launching of the cosmic rocket.

Eaton said that he believes that the American industrialists attending this banquet, like himself, "recognize the importance of reaching a mutual understanding with the powerful Soviet Union, whose achievements in science and industry are enormous."

Eaton advocated for competition between the two countries in the industrial sector, regardless of ideological differences. He also advocated for mutually beneficial trade between the two countries.

In his reply, Mikoyan said that as early as during the establishment of the Soviet state, Lenin had called on us to learn from the Americans' spirit of seeking truth from facts. Mikoyan said that the Soviet people will always praise this quality of the American people.

He said that now we have put forward the task of catching up with and surpassing the United States in terms of per capita production.

Mikoyan pointed out that the spirit expressed by the speakers at the banquet proves that the Soviet Union and the United States are capable of peaceful coexistence. Mikoyan said that now war can cause countless innocent people to suffer and cause destruction everywhere in a matter of minutes. Therefore, defending peace is more important now than at any other time in human history.

Mikoyan emphasized that trade can help consolidate peace, and peace is a necessary condition for trade. He expressed regret that there has been almost no trade between the Soviet Union and the United States in recent years. He said that the Soviet Union can export several hundred million dollars worth of goods that the United States needs to import from other countries.

Mikoyan also pointed out that the obstacles hindering the development of trade are all artificial obstacles. He said that the Soviet Union hopes to conduct trade on the basis of mutual benefit.

Mikoyan concluded by saying that consolidating peace is a common task. Mikoyan congratulated on peace and friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Mikoyan visited the electrical equipment factory of the Lincoln Electric Company in Cleveland, talked with the workers, and expressed interest in the workers' living and working conditions.

Mikoyan also visited Eaton's farm near Cleveland. Mikoyan, on behalf of the Soviet government, presented Eaton with a horse-drawn carriage with three Orlov Trotter horses.

    米高扬在克利夫兰发表讲话
    和平保障贸易  贸易有利和平
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社克利夫兰讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在克利夫兰进行了广泛的访问。
    当米高扬到达克利夫兰的时候，到机场欢迎的美国著名工业家伊顿向米高扬致欢迎词，欢迎他访问俄亥俄州。
    米高扬首先代表赫鲁晓夫向伊顿致意。他指出，伊顿不久前对苏联的访问表明了属于不同社会制度的人可能建立和睦的关系，可能成为在和平共处的条件下的朋友。
    米高扬最后向克利夫兰的居民致以良好的祝愿。
    7日上午米高扬出席了在“联合俱乐部”举行的宴会，出席宴会的有俄亥俄州所有实业界的代表、地方报纸出版人和公众代表。
    伊顿在宴会上向来自苏联的客人祝贺苏联科学上新的巨大成就。他说，全世界都赞美宇宙火箭的发射。
    伊顿说，他相信，出席这个宴会的美国实业界人士也和他一样，“认识到同强大的苏联取得相互谅解的重要性，苏联在科学和工业方面的成就是十分巨大的”。
    伊顿主张两国在实业界方面进行竞赛，而不管思想意识的差别。他还主张两国进行互利的贸易。
    米高扬在致答词中说，早在苏维埃国家建国期间，列宁就曾经号召我们向美国人学习实事求是的精神。米高扬说，苏联人永远称赞美国人民的这种品质。
    他说，现在我们提出了在生产方面按人口计算要赶上并且超过美国的任务。
    米高扬指出，宴会上的发言人所表示的精神证明，苏美两国是能够和平共处的。米高扬说，现在战争在一分钟之内就能使无数的人无辜受害，并且使各处遭到破坏。因此，现在保卫和平比人类历史上任何一个时期都更为重要。
    米高扬强调指出，贸易可能有助于巩固和平，而和平对于贸易又是必要的条件。他对近几年来苏美两国之间几乎没有进行什么贸易这件事表示遗憾。他说，苏联可以输出美国需要从其他国家输入的好几亿美元的商品。
    米高扬还指出，阻碍贸易发展的，都是人为的障碍。他说，苏联希望在互利的基础上进行贸易。
    米高扬最后说，巩固和平是共同的任务。米高扬祝贺和平和苏美两国的友谊。
    米高扬在克利夫兰参观了林肯电气公司的电气设备工厂，同工人谈了话，并且对工人的生活和劳动条件感到兴趣。
    米高扬还参观了克利夫兰附近的伊顿农场。米高扬代表苏联政府向伊顿赠送了三匹奥尔罗夫骏马拉的马车。
