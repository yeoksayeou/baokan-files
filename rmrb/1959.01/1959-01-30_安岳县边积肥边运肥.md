Anyue County Accumulates and Transports Fertilizer Simultaneously

    (Our dispatch) Sichuan Province's Anyue County is carrying out a mass movement to urgently accumulate and transport fertilizer, doing both simultaneously.

    So far, 200,000 people in the county have joined this movement. In the first five days, the county accumulated over 100.5 million dan of fertilizer, of which high-quality fertilizer (human and animal urine and manure) and fine fertilizer (compost, ash fertilizer, sod) accounted for 70%-80%. The vast majority of this fertilizer has been transported to the edges of the fields and piled up. The county's 600-plus local fertilizer plants have produced over 20 million jin of local fertilizer in the past month; in addition, the county has also planted a portion of green manure crops.

    Accumulating and transporting simultaneously is a characteristic of Anyue County's current fertilizer accumulation movement. Everywhere in the countryside, one can see fertilizer accumulation armies waving shovels, hoes, and brooms around pig and cattle pens, around courtyards, and in barren mountains and wild forests, loading sod, leaves, sludge, and dregs into carts and wheelbarrows, which are then transported to the fields by fertilizer transport armies.

    In order to ensure the smooth development of the fertilizer accumulation movement, each commune, after setting aside a certain amount of manpower for field management of spring crops, construction of basic farmland, and deep plowing of paddy fields, has put all remaining manpower into the fertilizer accumulation movement.

    In the fertilizer accumulation process, each commune has paid attention to the quality of the fertilizer, stipulating that poor-quality coarse fertilizer should generally not exceed 20% of the total amount. To ensure quality, the county, district, and commune party committees have all formed inspection and acceptance teams to go deep into various areas on patrol. If fertilizer is found to be substandard, it must be reprocessed.

    安岳县边积肥边运肥
    本报讯　四川省安岳县开展全民性突击积肥运肥运动，边积边运。
    到目前为止，全县已有二十万人投入这一运动。在最初的五天中，全县积肥一亿零五百多万担，其中精肥（人畜尿粪）、细肥（堆肥、灰肥、草皮）占到70％—80％。这些肥料绝大部分已经运到田埂、地边堆放好。全县六百多个土化肥厂，在最近一个多月中生产了土化肥两千多万斤；另外，全县还种植了一部分绿肥作物。
    边积边运，是安岳县这次积肥运动的特点。农村中到处可见积肥大军在猪牛圈旁，在院坝周围和荒山野林里，挥动着铁铲、镢头、扫帚，把草皮、树叶、污泥、渣滓等装进架车、鸡公车，由运肥大军运送到田地里去。
    为了使积肥运动顺利开展，各公社除留出一定数量的人力，从事小春作物田间管理、兴修基本农田和深翻水田外，其余全部人力都投入积肥运动。
    在积肥中，各公社都注意了肥料的质量。并规定出质量较差的粗肥，一般不得超出总量的20％。为了保证质量，县、区、社各级党委，都组成检查验收小组深入各地巡回，发现肥料不合标准，要重新加工。
