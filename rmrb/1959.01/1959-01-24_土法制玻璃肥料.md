Indigenous Method for Making Glass Fertilizer

Teachers at the Agricultural Science Institute and Agricultural School of Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, have successfully trial-produced glass fertilizer. This fertilizer can fully meet the needs of crops for trace elements such as manganese, boron, zinc, copper, iron, and magnesium, thereby increasing yield. The method is as follows: Use 500 grams of broken glass, 100 grams each of copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, borax, magnesium sulfate, and ferrous sulfate. Mix evenly, grind into a fine powder, pour into a clay crucible (or iron pot, earthenware pot), cover tightly, and place in a coke furnace to melt at high temperature, maintaining a temperature of 1000 degrees Celsius. Burn for one to two hours, until completely melted into a liquid, then immediately remove and pour onto an iron plate to cool and solidify into a hard block, resulting in yellowish-green glass fertilizer.

Glass fertilizer can be directly used as base fertilizer or top dressing for crops, or it can be used for seed soaking or spraying. The dosage is only half a catty to one and a half catties per mu. Its main advantages are: 1. Small dosage, great effect, one application of fertilizer (two catties per mu) can ensure fertilizer efficiency for three to five years. 2. Increase yield, improve crop quality, and reduce plant diseases and insect pests. 3. Trace elements are dissolved in the glass and will not be washed away by rain, nor will they easily react chemically with other substances in the soil and become insoluble.

    土法制玻璃肥料
    山西洪洞县农业科学研究所和县农业学校的教师们试制成功玻璃肥料。这种肥料能充分满足庄稼对锰、硼、锌、铜、铁、镁等微量元素的需要，从而提高产量。制法是：用碎玻璃五百克，硫酸铜、硫酸锌、硼砂、硫酸镁、黑矾各一百克，搅拌均匀，磨细成粉，倒入坩泥锅内（或铁锅、砂锅）盖实，放入焦炭炉里加高温溶化，保持摄氏一千度的温度。烧一至二小时，待完全溶成液体后，立即取出，倾于铁板上，使其冷却凝成硬块，即成黄绿色的玻璃肥料。
    玻璃肥料可直接给庄稼做底肥、追肥使用，也可浸种或喷射。每亩用量只需半斤到一斤半。其主要优点是：一、用量小，效果大，施肥一次（每亩二市斤）可保肥效三至五年。二、增加产量，改进作物的品质，并可减少植物的病虫害。三、微量元素含溶在玻璃中，不会被雨水冲刷而流失，也不易与土壤中其他物质起化学作用而成为不可溶解的状态。
