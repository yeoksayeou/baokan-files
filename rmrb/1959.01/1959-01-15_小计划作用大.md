Editor's Note:

    Small Plans, Big Impact
    The Third Production Brigade of Wangting Commune, in addition to formulating its annual and quarterly plans according to the commune's overall plan, also developed small-segment (seven-day) production plans for each production team. These large plans and small-segment plans are closely interconnected: if the large plan indicates the possibility of realizing a wish, then the formulation and completion of small-segment plans, which include specific requirements for farm work, labor, quality, and time, undoubtedly transform possibility into reality—completing the large plan. Therefore, the role of these small-segment production plans in the production process cannot be ignored, just as the construction of tall buildings requires the stacking of bricks and stones, one by one.

    小计划作用大
    望亭公社的第三生产大队按公社总计划订了自己一年的和季度的计划，除此以外，他们又以生产小队为单位，制订了小段（七天）生产计划。这里的大计划和小段计划有着密切的内在联系：如果说，大计划表明了一个愿望有实现的可能性；那么，包含了对农活、劳力、质量、时间等具体要求的小段计划一个个的制订和完成，就无疑地使可能性转变为现实性——完成大计划。所以，这种小段生产计划在生产进程中的作用是不能忽视的，正像修建高楼大厦总是要一砖一石地堆砌一样。
