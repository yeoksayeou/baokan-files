    Treating Wheat Fields Equally, Near and Far
    The Zhai Hao Management District of the Liuqiao People's Commune in Boxing County, Shandong Province, has recently been paying special attention to the management of wheat fields in remote areas, striving for a comprehensive bumper wheat harvest this year. The Party General Branch Committee of Zhai Hao Management District, based on the poor management of some remote wheat fields far from the village, recently organized the masses to discuss the problem of eliminating "three types of seedlings," enabling the masses to realize the important significance of a large-scale comprehensive harvest. The Management District has adopted various methods to strengthen the management of remote wheat fields, and some remote wheat fields have improved after topdressing and other measures.
