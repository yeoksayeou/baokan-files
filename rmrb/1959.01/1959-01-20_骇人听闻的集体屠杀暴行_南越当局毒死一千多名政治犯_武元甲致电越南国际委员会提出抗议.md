Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th—Colonel Ha Van Lau of the Vietnamese People's Army announced at a press conference here this afternoon an emergency telegram that General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent on the 18th to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam. Vo Nguyen Giap protested in the telegram against the crime of the South Vietnamese authorities in killing more than a thousand political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The telegram said that the victims included former resistance members and patriots from all walks of life in South Vietnam, who longed for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and were outstanding sons and daughters of the Vietnamese people.

The telegram stated that the Phu Loi concentration camp, located in Thu Dau Mot Province, South Vietnam, and disguised as a "Central Training Center," is one of the largest concentration camps in South Vietnam today. It regularly holds about six thousand political prisoners. On December 1, 1958, the South Vietnamese authorities poisoned the food, killing more than a thousand of them.

Vo Nguyen Giap said in the telegram: "This is one of the most barbaric political murder incidents in the world today, and is another, even more brutal killing incident following the large-scale killings of former resistance members in the Vi Xuyen and Huong Dien areas in 1955. It can only be compared to the mass killings in the concentration camps of the Hitler fascist regime."

The telegram said that this incident seriously violated Article 14(c) of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam and Article 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. These provisions stipulate that there shall be no retaliation or discrimination against former resistance members, their families, and related groups, and that their democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed. The telegram said that the Vietnamese people from North to South demand that the South Vietnamese authorities immediately stop persecuting and killing former resistance members and those who advocate peaceful reunification, and demand the dissolution of all concentration camps in South Vietnam disguised as "training centers."

General Vo Nguyen Giap said in the telegram: "In this telegram, I am raising this issue with the International Commission within the scope of the provisions of the Geneva Accords. At present, the lives of political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp are constantly threatened. In order to promptly rescue these peace-loving and just Vietnamese people, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army requests the International Commission to immediately take urgent measures to conduct an on-site investigation of the above-mentioned incident, immediately demand that the South Vietnamese authorities organize emergency rescue work, and restore the freedom of the innocent victims who are still imprisoned in the Phu Loi concentration camp."

At the press conference, Ha Van Lau described in detail the killing and abuse of political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp. He particularly pointed out that some South Vietnamese special agents in this concentration camp had received special agent training in the United States.

    骇人听闻的集体屠杀暴行
    南越当局毒死一千多名政治犯
    武元甲致电越南国际委员会提出抗议
    新华社河内19日电　越南人民军何文楼大校今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上公布了越南人民军总司令武元甲大将在18日给越南国际委员会主席安萨里的一份紧急电报。武元甲在电报里抗议南越当局杀害在富利集中营中的一千多名政治犯的罪行。
    电报说，被害者包括前抗战人员和南越各阶层的爱国者，他们渴望和平统一祖国，他们是越南人民的优秀儿女。
    电报说，设在南越土龙木省、并以“中央整训中心”为幌子的富利集中营是南越目前最大的集中营之一。那里经常禁闭着大约六千名政治犯。1958年12月1日，南越当局在饭里放毒，杀害了其中的一千多人。
    武元甲在电报里说：这是世界上当前最野蛮的政治杀害事件之一，是继1955年维川、向田地方的大批杀害前抗战人员之后的又一个更加残暴的杀害事件。它只能同希特勒法西斯制度的集中营里的大批屠杀事件相比拟。
    电报说，这个事件严重违反了越南停止敌对行动的协定的第十四条丙款和日内瓦会议最后宣言第九条的规定。这些条款规定，不得报复和歧视前抗战人员及其家属和有关团体，并且保证他们的民主自由权。电报说，从北到南的越南人民要求南越当局立即停止对前抗战人员和赞成和平统一的人士进行迫害和屠杀，要求解散南越以“整训中心”为幌子的所有集中营。
    武元甲大将在电报中说：“在这份电报里，我是在日内瓦协议各项条款的范围内，向国际委员会提出这个问题的。而目前，在富利集中营里的政治犯的生命时刻受到威胁。为了及时援救这些爱好和平和正义的越南人民，越南人民军总司令部要求国际委员会立即采取紧急措施就上述事件进行现场调查，立即要求南越当局组织急救工作，并且恢复目前还被禁闭在富利集中营里的无辜受害者的自由。”
    何文楼在记者招待会上详细地叙述了富利集中营的政治犯被杀害和虐待的情况。他特别指出，这个集中营里的有些南越特务人员，曾经在美国受过专门的特务训练。
