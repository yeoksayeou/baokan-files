Guaranteeing the First Gate of High-Quality Steel

Shijiazhuang Vigorously Grasps Pig Iron Quality

(According to the Hebei Daily) Inspired by the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, all employees on the Shijiazhuang City iron smelting front have been fiercely attacking the quality of pig iron, making rapid improvements in the quality of pig iron. The sulfur content has generally been reduced to around 0.15%, and the city has basically eliminated substandard iron.

In early December of last year, the sulfur content of most of the pig iron in the city was above 0.2%. After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to improve the quality of steel, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held three consecutive meetings of the party committee secretaries of iron smelting units to specifically study the issue of improving pig iron quality. All employees of the iron smelting units also launched a large-scale airing of views, blooming, and debate on the topic of "whether quality can be improved while completing production plans," and all employees launched a mass movement to fiercely attack the quality of pig iron with revolutionary spirit. In this movement, the party committee secretaries of each iron smelting unit, with the same vigor as in the past when rushing to build blast furnaces and grabbing pig iron output, vigorously cultivated experimental plots to improve pig iron quality.

All iron smelting units in the city have established testing institutions, allocated testing personnel, and started to conduct tests for every furnace, using the tests to guide production. The Qiaodong People's Commune Iron Smelting Plant conducts tests and analyzes every furnace, and also hands over the test reports of each furnace to the hot air workers and furnace workers, so that the workers know the details of the sulfur content of each furnace and clarify the direction of efforts for the next furnace, which significantly improves the quality of pig iron. On January 5th and 6th, the iron produced by this plant was all Grade 1 and Special Grade iron.

The employees of the iron smelting units in Shijiazhuang City have carefully studied and resolved the problems affecting the quality of pig iron one by one. The Steel Plant tightly grasped the furnace temperature, and re-repaired all wind ducts with air leaks, and increased the wind temperature from 460 degrees to 550 degrees. The Vehicle Plant washed coal and produced coke by themselves, and implemented external alkali desulfurization. From January 1st to 5th, the sulfur content of pig iron was reduced from 0.45 to 0.16. The Power Plant organized special personnel to sinter ore powder to remove sulfides from the ore, sintering more than 900 tons of ore powder from December 30th of last year to January 6th of this year. The iron smelting plants have universally strengthened management work, formulated management systems and safety technical operating procedures, and earnestly implemented the shift handover system and work diaries.

In the struggle to improve pig iron quality and reduce sulfur content, the pig iron output of some units once declined. Some people then believed that this was caused by improving quality. On January 7th, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held another meeting of the party committee secretaries and directors of the iron smelting plants, and used the fact that the No. 2 furnace of the Steel Plant had achieved a double leap in output and quality to criticize the one-sided view of opposing output and quality. The 15-cubic-meter No. 2 furnace of this plant, due to strengthened management and improved operating procedures, produced 11 tons of iron on January 4th, 16 tons of iron on the 5th, and rose to more than 17 tons on the 6th. All of these irons were Grade 2 or above, with an average sulfur content of 0.124.

The improvement in the quality of pig iron has brought great convenience to the machinery manufacturing industry. The yield rate of finished products in the city's mechanical parts processing has risen to over 95%.

    保证优质钢材的第一关
    石家庄猛抓生铁质量
    据河北日报消息　石家庄市炼铁战线上的全体职工，在党的八届六中全会决议精神的鼓舞下，猛攻生铁质量关，使生铁质量迅速提高，含硫量一般已降到0.15％左右，全市已基本上消灭了等外铁。
    去年12月上旬，这个市的生铁含硫量大部分在零点二以上。中共河北省委发出提高钢铁质量的指示后，中共石家庄市委连续召开了三次炼铁单位的党委书记会议，对提高生铁质量问题进行了专门研究。所有炼铁单位的职工也以“在完成产量计划的同时能否提高质量”为题展开了大鸣大放大辩论，全体职工以革命的精神展开了猛攻生铁质量关的群众运动。在这一运动中，各炼铁单位的党委书记像过去突击高炉建设和抓生铁产量那样的劲头，大搞试验田，提高生铁质量。
    全市所有炼铁单位，都建立了化验机构，调配了化验人员，开始作到炉炉化验，通过化验指导生产。桥东人民公社炼铁厂炉炉化验，炉炉分析，而且把每一炉的化验单交给热风工和炉前工，让工人群众都知道每一炉的含硫底细，明确下炉的努力方向，使生铁质量显著提高。这个厂在1月5、6日两天，炼出的铁全部是一号铁和特号铁。
    石家庄市各炼铁单位的职工对影响生铁质量的问题都逐个地认真研究解决。钢铁厂抓紧炉温关口，对所有跑风漏风的风道都重新进行了修补，并且把风温由四百六十度提高到五百五十度。车辆厂自己洗煤、炼焦，并实行了炉外加碱脱硫，在1月1日至5日生铁含硫量由过去的零点四五降低到零点一六。动力厂组织专人进行矿粉烧结，以脱除矿石中的硫化物，从去年12月30日到今年1月6日共烧结矿粉九百多吨。各炼铁厂普遍加强了管理工作，制订了管理制度、安全技术操作规程，切实执行了交接班制度和作业日记。
    在提高生铁质量、降低含硫量的斗争中，有的单位的生铁产量曾一度下降，于是有人认为是提高质量所造成的。中共石家庄市委在1月7日又召开了各炼铁厂的党委书记、厂长会议，以钢铁厂二号炉产量质量双跃进的事实批判了把产量和质量对立起来的片面观点。这个厂十五立方公尺的二号炉，由于加强了管理、改进了操作规程，1月4日产铁十一吨，5日产铁十六吨，6日又上升到十七吨多。这些铁全部是二级以上的铁，含硫量平均为零点一二四。
    生铁质量提高，带给机械制造工业很大便利。全市机械部件加工的成品率已上升到95％以上。
