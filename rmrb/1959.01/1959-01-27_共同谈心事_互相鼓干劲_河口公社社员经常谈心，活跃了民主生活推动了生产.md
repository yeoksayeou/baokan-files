Sharing Concerns and Encouraging Each Other
　　Hekou Commune Members Regularly Confide in Each Other, Activating Democratic Life and Promoting Production

　　(Our Dispatch) The Yangmei Management District of Hekou People's Commune in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, has adopted the method of frequent heart-to-heart talks among its members, promptly discovering and adjusting contradictions between cadres and members, and among members themselves. This has gradually formed a vivid and lively political situation with both centralization and democracy, discipline and freedom, unified will and personal ease of mind.

　　The heart-to-heart talk meetings are held on a production team basis, usually once every five days. The masses use this format to evaluate work, praising the advanced and establishing role models. Recently, the entire management district has selected 181 "Five-Good" members and "Five-Good" cadres. Tang Zhen is an elderly person, but in the spirit of contributing whatever strength she has, she is never absent, and her manure accumulation and work quality are better than others, earning her praise from everyone. Commune member Liang Yaocha has always loved the commune as his home, so everyone wrote a big-character poster to him. The big-character poster said: "Liang Yaocha, always loves the commune as his home, diligently collects cow dung and urine, harvests carefully and meticulously, protects grain well, works actively and willingly, never bargains over work assignments, everyone should learn from him!"

　　When commune members freely confide in each other, they also offer mutual suggestions, engage in criticism and self-criticism. For example, commune member Cheng Ju was not active in production, so other members sincerely offered him their opinions at the heart-to-heart talk meeting. Elder commune member Cheng Ban said: "I am over seventy years old, and seeing the commune's production getting better and better, I can't help but go out and do some light work. You are decades younger than me, but you don't want to work. Think about where our daily three meals come from. Eating without working, your conscience won't let you get away with it!" After everyone's patient help, Cheng Ju finally became active, not only attending work every day, but also improving his work efficiency, which pleased everyone.

　　At the heart-to-heart talk meetings, cadres also frequently summarize work achievements and study work problems with the masses. For example, the production team led by Chen Ruiming, the deputy captain of the New and Old West Production Team, transported 37,300 loads of pond mud and 2,300 loads of miscellaneous soil fertilizer in five days, exceeding the fertilizer accumulation task by 5%, but still could not out-compete the competition partner, Chen Chiwei's team. At the heart-to-heart talk meeting, everyone studied the reasons for not being able to catch up with Chen Chiwei's team. Initially, some people blamed each other for not working hard enough. Later, commune member Cheng Runjin analyzed: "The main reason why our fertilizer accumulation has not been as good as others during this period is that we have not been proactive enough in tool innovation. Chen Chiwei's team is using ox-drawn carts to transport fertilizer, averaging more than 800 loads per person per day. We are still using shoulder poles and small wheelbarrows, so of course we can't catch up with them." Everyone agreed with this opinion and decided to immediately start building ox-drawn carts, striving to win the red flag in the next fertilizer accumulation competition. In one day, the entire team made 14 ox-drawn carts, and later created a new commune record of transporting 1,020 loads of fertilizer per person per day, surpassing other teams.

　　The difficulties and problems raised by the masses at the heart-to-heart talk meetings are also promptly resolved, making the commune members feel happy and work even harder. For example, when cadres heard members' opinions about the public canteen at the heart-to-heart talk meeting, they immediately convened an on-site meeting to investigate the reasons and summarize experiences to improve the canteen. Recently, the weather has been cold, so cadres often go to the canteen to check and supervise, ensuring that members eat hot meals, hot dishes, and drink hot tea. Cadres learned at the heart-to-heart talk meeting that some members lacked winter clothing, so they organized members to help each other solve the problem. Cadres learned that members were sick, and immediately sent people to express condolences and help solve difficulties. Therefore, the members felt very satisfied.

    共同谈心事　互相鼓干劲
    河口公社社员经常谈心，活跃了民主生活推动了生产
    本报讯　广东省南海县河口人民公社杨梅管理区，采取社员经常谈心的方法，及时发现和调整干部与社员、社员与社员之间的矛盾，逐渐形成了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面。
    谈心会是以生产小组为单位进行的，一般每隔五天举行一次。群众利用谈心会这个形式，进行评比工作，使先进的得到表扬，树立榜样。最近，全管理区已评出“五好”社员、“五好”干部共一百八十一人。唐真是上了年纪的人，但她本着有一分力出一分力的精神，从不缺勤，积肥数量和工作质量都比别人好，受到大家的赞扬。社员梁耀茶，一向爱社如家，大家便写了一张大字报赠给他。大字报说：“梁耀茶，一向爱社如家，牛屎牛尿勤装下，收割时细收又细打，爱护粮食确不错，工作积极又肯干，分工唔讲价，人人都要学习他！”
    社员在畅谈心事时，还相互提意见，展开批评和自我批评。如社员程居有生产不积极，社员便在谈心会上诚恳地向他提出意见。如老社员程板说：“我七十多岁了，看到社的生产越来越好，也禁不住要出勤做点轻活，你比我年轻几十年，却不想劳动了。试想想，我们天天吃饱三餐饭的日子是从何来的，只吃饭不劳动，问良心也过不去呀！”经过大家的耐心帮助，程居有终于积极起来，不但天天出勤，而且工作效率也有提高，大家都表示满意。
    在谈心会上，干部还经常和群众一起总结工作成绩，研究工作问题。如新旧西生产队副队长陈瑞明领导的生产小组，五天内担塘坭三万七千三百担、土杂肥二千三百担，超额5％完成了积肥任务，但仍然赛不过竞赛对手陈炽维小组。谈心会上，大家研究赶不上陈炽维小组的原因，最初有人互相埋怨工作不够奋勇，后来社员程润金分析说：“这段时间积肥比不上别人多，主要是我们对工具改革不够积极，陈炽维小组都用牛拉滑车运肥，平均每人每天运肥八百多担，我们还是使用肩挑、小单轮车，当然就赶不上他们。”大家都同意这个意见，便决定立即动手赶制牛拉车，争取在下一期进行积肥评比时夺得红旗。在一天内，全组就制好牛拉车十四部，后来又创造了每人一天运肥一千零二十担的全社最高纪录，又赶过了别的小组。
    群众在谈心会上提出的困难和问题，也及时得到解决，使社员的心情舒畅，干劲更高。如干部在谈心会上听到社员对公共食堂有意见，便立即召开现场会议，检查原因，总结经验，把食堂办好。近日来天气寒冷，干部便经常到食堂检查督促，保证了社员食热饭热菜，饮热茶。干部在谈心会上了解到一些社员缺乏寒衣，便组织社员互相帮助解决。干部了解到社员有病，立即派人慰问和帮助解决困难，因此，社员感到非常满意。
