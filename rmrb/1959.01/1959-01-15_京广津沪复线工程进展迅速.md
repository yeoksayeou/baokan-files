Enhance the Transportation Capacity of the Two Major North-South Arteries to Adapt to the Current Great Development of the National Economy
Jingguang and Jin-Hu Railway Double-Tracking Projects Progress Rapidly
The Ministry of Railways and the Henan Provincial Party Committee Hold On-Site Meetings to Exchange Experiences on Relying on Party Committees to Mobilize the Masses to Build Railways

    This newspaper reports that under the illumination of the Party's policy of the whole Party and the entire people building railways, the double-tracking projects of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu Railways are progressing rapidly. The Jingguang Railway double-tracking project, which started earlier, has seen the basic completion of all roadbed earthwork and small bridge and culvert projects from Zhengzhou to Hengyang after several months of hard work by the people along the line; the track has been laid for 300 kilometers from Zhengzhou to Hankou. Soon, the double track north of Hengyang will be fully open to traffic.
    The Jingguang and Jin-Hu Railways are two major north-south transportation lines in China. These two lines have been open to traffic for more than 50 years. Before liberation, due to the corruption and incompetence of the reactionary government and years of war, these two railways were frequently interrupted, with the Jingguang line being interrupted for as long as thirteen years. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, they were quickly repaired and opened to traffic in 1949. In recent years, major line repairs have been carried out, heavy steel rails have been replaced, maintenance and repair have been strengthened, passing stations have been added, station trackage has been extended, large locomotives and double-engine traction have been used, and a series of advanced technical measures have been adopted, greatly increasing the permissible line speed. Taking the Jinghan Line as an example, the permissible speed before liberation was only 15 kilometers per hour, but after several years of renovation, it has been increased to 110 kilometers per hour, and the switch passing speed has been increased to 80 kilometers per hour. In the Luoyang-Xinyang section, where transportation business is very busy, the downstream cargo volume passed in 1957 increased by 2.7 times compared with 1951, and the number of passenger trains increased by 70%.
    With the recovery and development of the national economy, the establishment of factories and mines along the line, the density of dedicated lines and railway branch lines, the volume of passenger and freight traffic is increasing, and the passing capacity is becoming increasingly insufficient. After the comprehensive leap forward in industry and agriculture, especially after the whole people started running iron and steel, the transportation task became even heavier. These two lines are under greater pressure due to supporting Shanghai, the two lakes (Hubei and Hunan), the two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi), Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces with coal, ore, and other materials, and the insufficient transportation capacity is even more prominent. Taking the Luoyang-Xinyang section of the Jingguang line as an example, the volume of traffic in October last year increased sharply by two times compared with January, and the volume of traffic in one month was 22% greater than the volume of traffic in the entire year of 1951. Even so, a large amount of materials, especially coal, continues to flow south. Judging from the transportation needs of November last year, the average daily demand for freight trains for the coal and other materials needed by the two lakes and the two Guangs, which are borne by the southern section of the Jingguang line, can only meet 50% to 60%. Judging from the materials received from the Bengbu port of the Jinpu Line, the number of vehicles needed in November increased sharply by four times compared with January, while the actual passing capacity can only complete about 60%.
    After several years of renovation, the single-line capacity of these two trunk lines has long reached saturation, and even with the use of single-line automatic blocking, it can no longer meet the rapidly growing transportation needs, let alone the long-term transportation needs. Therefore, the double-tracking of these two railways is imperative and cannot be delayed. However, to build the double tracks of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu railways in a short period of time, it is impossible to rely solely on the professional teams of the railway department. However, after the realization of the people's commune, the superiority of being able to concentrate manpower and material resources provided favorable conditions for implementing the policy of the whole Party and the entire people building railways. When the call for building double tracks was put forward, it was immediately met with a positive response from various places. Starting in August 1958, first in Henan Province, then in Hunan, Shanghai and other places, a vigorous mass movement was quickly launched under the leadership of the Party committee. On the long line of more than 2,000 kilometers, a massive and magnificent army of more than one million road builders, with incomparable power, swept away all difficulties and obstacles, and completed the railway construction project in a few months that would have taken two or three years in the past, effectively guaranteeing the early completion of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu double tracks, and making a huge contribution to increasing the passing capacity of the north-south railway trunk lines and promoting the construction of industrial and agricultural production throughout the country.
    The experience of building the double tracks of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu lines has fully proved that under the unified planning of the central government, under the direct leadership of the local Party committee, mobilizing and organizing the local people and railway construction teams to build roads together is the fundamental way to implement the Party's general line of socialism and build railways in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. It is undoubtedly convincing that the policy of the whole Party and the entire people building railways is completely correct and incomparably superior.
    Based on this situation, in order to exchange experiences in the whole Party and the entire people building railways, the Ministry of Railways, together with the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, jointly held an on-site meeting in Zhengzhou at the end of December last year. The meeting showed that a vigorous movement of the whole Party and the entire people building railways is gradually unfolding across the country. The Sichuan-Yu Railway in Sichuan Province, the Neikun Railway in Yunnan Province, the Lanqing Railway in Qinghai Province, and the Yanhua Railway in Jilin Province, which are currently under construction, are all large-scale railway infrastructure construction projects that are being built in a more, faster, better, and more economical way under the direct leadership of the provincial Party committee, mobilizing and organizing tens of thousands of local laborers, and mobilizing all positive factors and resources in the locality. These projects have already achieved great results.
    Practice in various places has proved that the implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the entire people building railways has achieved remarkable results. First of all, it has opened up a broad road for building railways at high speed. In the past, when the Zhengzhou Railway Administration relied on railway professional teams to build the 174-kilometer-long Anyang-Zhengzhou double track, it took 18 months, which was already a great improvement in efficiency compared with the past; but now, relying on the Party committee to mobilize the masses to build railways, 200,000 road-building troops have basically completed the 322-kilometer-long Zhengzhou-Lijiazhai double-track project in about four months, which is seven times more efficient than in the past, and the project quality is very good. The 591-kilometer-long Jinpu Railway double track built by Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, with 300,000 road-building troops, started construction in late October 1958, and by December 18, it had completed more than 90% of the earthwork project of the entire line, and the main line track laying reached 174.8 kilometers, and 110 kilometers of new roads have been delivered for traffic use. The speed of building railways in this way is unprecedented in the history of our country. Secondly, a large number of technical personnel for railway construction have been trained. According to statistics from Xuchang and Xinyang prefectures in Henan Province, more than 23,500 skilled road construction technicians have been trained in the construction of the Jingguang Railway double-track project, preparing a strong technical force for the greater development of the railway construction industry in the future. Furthermore, in the current situation of insufficient supply of machinery, tools, and raw materials, relying on the Party committee to mobilize the masses to build railways facilitates the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and effectively exploiting the potential of local materials. For example, in the Jin-Hu Railway double-track project, 150 kilometers of steel rails were solved by relying on the masses to collect and dismantle branch lines. According to statistics from Xinyang Prefecture in Henan Province, in the process of building roads, counties and townships produced more than 400,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel materials, more than 3,000 cubic meters of wood, and 6,000 kilograms of explosives, thus greatly saving the country's investment. Finally, railway construction can be combined with local farmland water conservancy construction, urban construction, etc., to achieve overall planning, comprehensive utilization, and achieve multiple benefits with one effort. For example, Xuchang Prefecture, combined with the double-track repair, turned the soil pits into ponds, which can store 220,000 cubic meters of water; turned wasteland gullies into rice fields, expanding cultivated land by more than 1,000 mu, and also combined it with the layout of river network and greening to make a comprehensive plan.
    This meeting conducted a more detailed study and discussion on issues such as how to strengthen organizational leadership, mobilize the people, construction methods, use local materials, and cooperate and coordinate in the implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the entire people building railways.

    增强南北两大动脉运输力适应当前国民经济大发展
    京广津沪复线工程进展迅速
    铁道部和河南省委召开现场会议交流依靠党委发动群众修铁路的经验
    本报讯　在党的全党全民修铁路的方针的照耀下，京广、津沪铁路复线工程进展迅速。动工较早的京广铁路复线工程，经过沿线人民几个月的辛勤劳动，现在，除北京到郑州的复线早已建成外，郑州到衡阳一段全部路基土石方工程和小桥涵工程已基本完成；郑州到汉口段已铺轨三百公里。不久，衡阳以北的复线即可全线通车。
    京广、津沪铁路是我国南北交通的两条主要干线。这两条线建成通车都已有五十多年。解放前由于反动政府的腐败无能和连年的战争，这两条铁路都时时中断，其中京广线曾中断行车达十三年之久。解放后，在党的正确领导下，1949年即迅速修复通车，几年来进行了线路大修，更换了重型钢轨，加强了养护维修，增加了会让站，延长了车站股道，使用了大型机车和双机牵引，采用了一系列先进的技术措施，大大提高了线路容许速度。以京汉线为例，解放前容许速度每小时仅十五公里，经几年改造后就提高到一百一十公里，道岔通过速度提高到每小时八十公里。运输业务十分繁忙的漯河到信阳区段，1957年通过的下行货物运量比1951年增加了二点七倍，通过的旅客列车增加了70％。
    随着国民经济的恢复和发展，沿线厂矿的建立，专用线和铁路支线的密布，客货运量越来越大，通过能力日益感到不足。工农业全面大跃进后，特别是全民大办钢铁以后，运输任务就更加繁重。这两条线由于支援上海市、两湖、两广、江苏、浙江、江西等地区煤炭及矿石等物资，运输能力不足的局面就更为突出。以京广的漯河信阳段为例，去年10月份较1月份的运量猛增两倍，一个月的运量就比1951年全年的运量大22％。即令如此，仍有大批物资，特别是煤炭不断源源南下。从去年11月的运输需要来看，京广南段所担负的两湖、两广所需的煤炭及其他物资，平均每天需要的货物列车只能满足50％至60％。从津浦线蚌埠口接入的物资来看，11月份所需要的车辆较1月份猛增了四倍，而实际通过能力只能完成60％左右。
    经过几年改造，这两条干线单线能力早达到饱和程度，即使采用单线自动闭塞，也已不能适应目前迅速增长的运输需要，更不能适应远期的运输需要。因此，这两条铁路的复线势在必修，刻不容缓。但是，要想在短短的时间内，修好京广、津沪两条铁路的复线，单靠铁路部门的专业队，是办不到的。然而，在实现人民公社化以后，那种更能集中使用人力物力的优越性，就给贯彻全党全民修铁路的方针提供了有利条件。当修建复线的号召一提出，便立即得到各地积极响应。从1958年8月份开始，首先在河南省，接着在湖南、上海等地，相继在党委的领导下迅速掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在绵长二千多公里的线路上，一百多万筑路大军声势浩大、波澜壮阔，以无比的威力，横扫一切困难和障碍，在短短的几个月时间内，完成了过去要用两、三年才能完成的铁路修建工程，有力地保证了提前修通京广、津沪复线，为增加南北铁路干线的通过能力，促进全国工农业生产建设，作出了巨大贡献。
    修筑京广、津沪两条复线的经验，已充分证明根据中央的统一规划，在地方党委的直接领导下，动员组织当地人民群众和铁路工程队一起修路，是贯彻党的社会主义总路线，多、快、好、省地建设铁路的根本道路，无可争辩地使人信服全党全民修铁路这个方针的完全正确和无比优越。
    铁道部根据这个情况，为了交流全党全民修铁路的经验，特在去年12月底和中共河南省委在郑州共同召开了现场会议。会议表明，一个声势浩大的全党全民修铁路的运动，正在全国逐步展开。目前正在修筑的四川省的川豫铁路、云南省的内昆铁路、青海省的兰青铁路、吉林省的烟桦铁路等，都是在省委的直接领导下，动员组织当地数以万计的民工，调动地方上的一切积极因素和资源，多、快、好、省地进行修建的规模宏伟的铁路基本建设工程，这些工程已经取得了巨大成绩。
    各地的实践证明，贯彻全党全民修铁路的方针，已经获得了显著成效。首先它为高速度地建设铁路开辟了广阔的道路。郑州铁路管理局过去靠铁路专业队修建全长一百七十四公里的安（阳）郑（州）复线时，前后用了十八个月，这已经比以前的效率大大提高了；但是现在依靠党委发动群众修铁路，二十万修路大军，在四个月左右时间，就基本完成了全长三百二十二公里的郑（州）李（家寨）复线工程，比过去提高效率七倍，而且工程质量很好。山东、江苏、安徽三省修建的五百九十一公里津浦路复线，三十万筑路大军，从1958年10月下旬开始动工，到12月18日为止，已完成全线土石方工程的90％以上，并且正线铺轨达一百七十四点八公里，已交付通车使用的新路一百一十公里。这样修铁路的速度，在我国历史上是没有的。其次，培养出大量修铁路的技术人材。据河南省许昌、信阳两专区的统计，在修建京广铁路复线的工程中，即培养出较熟练的修路技术人材二万三千五百多名，为今后铁路建设事业的更大发展，准备了强大的技术力量。再次，在当前机具、原材料供应不足的情况下，依靠党委发动群众修铁路，便于土洋结合，就地取材，有效地发挥地方物资的潜力。如津沪路复线工程，有一百五十公里的钢轨，是依靠群众搜集和拆除支线等解决的。据河南省信阳专区的统计，在修路当中各县、乡自己生产的砂石料四十余万方，木材三千余方，炸药六千公斤，因此，大大节约了国家的投资。最后，可以把铁路建设和当地的农田水利的建设、城市建设等结合起来，作到统筹兼顾，综合利用，收到一举数得的效果。如许昌专区，结合修复线，变取土坑为水塘，可蓄水二十二万立方；变荒草沟为稻田，扩大耕地一千多亩，并且还和河网化、绿化的布局结合起来，作了全面的规划。
    这次会议，对于在贯彻全党全民修铁路的方针中，如何加强组织领导、发动人民群众、施工方法、就地取材和协作配合等方面的问题，作了较详细的研究讨论。（附图片）
