According to a report from Dazhong Daily, commune members of the Second Brigade of the Beiyuan People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, conducted a major debate on family issues.

With the establishment of the People's Commune, this brigade also implemented collectivization in life. Commune members generally eat in public canteens and have established nurseries, kindergartens, sewing groups, laundry groups, and homes for the elderly. The establishment of these collective welfare undertakings has been greatly appreciated by the vast number of commune members, especially women, who are all smiles. However, some people also developed some confused ideas regarding whether small families still exist and what kind of small families should be established. Some people were not clear about these issues, leading to much discussion. In order to guide everyone to recognize these problems, the Party Branch organized commune members to launch a broad debate. During the debate, commune members spoke enthusiastically.

	Abolish the Feudal Patriarchal System
		Establish a Happy New Family

The first to speak was Pang Xiping. He said, "After the establishment of the People's Commune, eating doesn't cost money, and wherever you go within the commune is home." Pang Xiping raised a question: Within the big family of the People's Commune, do small families still exist?

The debate unfolded like this. Yan Zhenhua said, "I think we still have small families now. After finishing work, we still return home to reunite with our families." Li Chuantai said, "Small families not only should exist, but they should also be established more beautifully and happily." He also said, "The main purpose of the elderly going to homes for the elderly and children going to nurseries is to liberate labor power." Song Xuesheng said, "Now, after work, couples still live together, and children can also be brought back, living a life of family reunion. Isn't this a small family!" He then continued, "In the future, when building residential areas, we should also take care of the reunion of families, men, women, old, and young." Young woman Pang Xiufang said, "What we want to abolish is the feudal patriarchal system, not to abolish small families; small families not only should exist, but they should also be democratic and united new families, becoming more and more beautiful."

Through this debate, commune members realized that families, men, women, old, and young, still have to live together, and parents and children are still relatives, with parents still having the responsibility to educate their children. Within the big family of the People's Commune, small families still exist. What we are abolishing is the unreasonable feudal patriarchal system, not the small family. After cooperation, the small family has gradually ceased to be a production unit. With the development of production and collective welfare undertakings, the thorough liberation of women's labor force, and the improvement of the masses' political consciousness and cultural level, the feudal patriarchal system will gradually be abolished, and the life of small families will become more and more democratic, united, and happy.

	Only by Doing a Good Job in Collective Life
		Can There Be a Happy Family

Next, Bian Shuyuan raised two more questions: What is the relationship between small family life and collective life? Is collective life a direction?

Regarding these questions, most commune members believed that to live a truly equal, beautiful, and happy small family life, it is first necessary to develop production, run the commune well, and run collective welfare undertakings well. They used their own life experiences to illustrate this relationship. Song Xuesheng said, "The families of the past were different, some were rich, some were poor. Before liberation, my family had nine people, so poor that we had to beg for food. After liberation, we were allocated land, but because there were many people and few laborers, we still couldn't get enough to eat. When we joined the advanced cooperative, the work points we earned were only enough to buy grain. After the establishment of the commune, it's different. Eating doesn't cost money, and I still earn ten yuan or so in wages every month. My family life is better than before." Yu Chang also said, "After the establishment of the commune, the children go to nurseries, where they are well taken care of and well educated. The children learn benevolence, respect, knowledge, courtesy, and morality, which is better than being at home." After debating back and forth, everyone became clearer: only by running nurseries well, running canteens and other collective welfare undertakings well, relieving women of the burden of tedious housework, and economically, wives no longer depend on husbands, and children no longer depend on parents, can the unreasonable feudal patriarchal system be fundamentally abolished and a democratic and united new family be established.

	Establish a Democratic and United New Family

Yu Chang's speech led the debate to another issue: What kind of small family should be established? He said, "In the old society, wives relied on husbands for food, being beaten and scolded; now women participate in production and are thoroughly liberated. The old should not oppress the young with feudal ideas, and the young should also respect the old. Husbands and wives should respect and love each other, and sisters should be united." Pang Xiufang said, "Women participate in production, are economically independent, and can dispose of their wages themselves, but they must respect the old and love the young, and there must be no lack of respect for elders or juniors." Aunt Ren Chengfang also agreed with these speeches very much. She mentioned that in her family, there was still a lack of mutual care and mutual help between the old and young and between sisters-in-law, and economic expenditures were not discussed. Pang Xiufang suggested that her family should have a small plan and discuss expenditures so that the family can be united. Finally, everyone unanimously realized that the unreasonable feudal patriarchal old family must be replaced by a democratic and united new family; to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to actively participate in labor, strive to build socialism, run the commune well, and run collective welfare undertakings well.

    发展民主团结的家庭生活
    历城北园人民公社辩论家庭问题得出结论
    据大众日报消息　山东省历城县北园人民公社二大队社员，就家庭问题进行了一次大辩论。
    随着人民公社的建立，这个大队在生活上也实行了集体化。社员普遍到公共食堂吃饭，并创办了托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫组、洗衣组、敬老院。这些集体福利事业的举办，广大社员都非常满意，特别是妇女，更是笑逐颜开。但部分人也产生了一些糊涂思想，对于还有没有小家庭？应该建立什么样的小家庭？有些人不太明确，议论纷纷。党总支为了引导大家认清这些问题，便组织社员广泛地展开了辩论。在辩论时，社员们纷纷发言。
      废除封建家长制
        建立美满新家庭
    第一个发言的是庞西平。他说：“成立人民公社后，吃饭不要钱，在社内走到哪里哪里就是家”。庞西平提出一个问题：在人民公社这个大家庭内，现在还有没有小家庭？
    辩论就这样展开了。阎振华说：“我看现在咱还有小家庭，干活完了以后，还是回到家里一家人团聚在一起。”李传太说：“小家庭不但应该有，而且要建立得更美满更幸福。”他又说：“老人上敬老院，孩子上托儿所，主要是为了解放劳动力。”宋学生说：“现在干活回家还是夫妻同居，孩子也可领回来，过着一家团圆的日子，这还不是小家庭！”他又接着说：“将来建筑居民点，也要照顾一家一户男女老幼的团聚。”青年妇女庞秀芳说：“我们要废除的是封建家长制，不是取消小家庭；小家庭不仅要有，而且是民主团结的新家庭，越过越美满。”
    经过这段辩论，社员们都认识到，一家一户男女老幼还要生活在一起，父母子女仍然是亲属关系，作父母的还有教养子女的责任。在人民公社这个大家庭内，还是有小家庭存在的。我们废除的是不合理的封建家长制，不是小家庭。合作化以后，小家庭已逐渐地不是一个生产单位，随着生产和集体福利事业的发展，妇女劳动力的彻底解放，群众政治觉悟和文化水平的提高，封建家长制的逐步废除，小家庭的生活会越来越民主、团结和幸福。
    只有搞好集体生活
      才有幸福的家庭
    接着，边书元又提出了两个问题：小家庭生活和集体生活是什么关系？集体生活是不是个方向？
    对于这些问题，大多数社员认为要过真正平等、美满、幸福的小家庭生活，首先必须发展生产，搞好公社，搞好集体福利事业。他们以自己的生活经历来说明了这个关系。宋学生说：“过去的家是不一样的，有富的，有穷的。解放前，我家九口人，穷的要饭。解放后，分得了土地，但由于人口多，劳动力少，还是弄不上吃的，入高级社，挣的工分，也仅够买粮吃。成立公社后，可不同了，吃饭不要钱，每月还挣十来元工资，我的家庭生活比以前更好了。”余昌也说：“成立公社后，孩子上了托儿所，照顾得好，教育得也好，孩子学得仁恭知礼，比在家可好了。”辩来辩去，大家更加清楚了：只有办好托儿所，搞好食堂等集体福利事业，解除妇女繁琐的家务劳动的牵累，在经济上妻子不再依赖丈夫，孩子不再依赖父母，才能从根子上废除不合理的封建家长制，建立民主团结的新家庭。
  建立民主团结新家庭
    余昌的一段发言，又把辩论引上另一个问题：要建立一个什么样的小家庭？他说：“旧社会老婆依靠丈夫吃饭，打过来，骂过去；现在妇女参加了生产，得到彻底解放，老的不要以封建思想压迫小的，年轻的也应对老人尊敬，夫妻应互敬互爱，姊妹要团结。”庞秀芳说：“妇女参加了生产，经济上独立了，领的工资可以自己支配，但必须尊老爱幼，不能没老没少。”任成芳大娘听了这些发言也非常同意。她谈到在她的家里，老少以及妯娌之间，还缺乏互相照顾互相帮助，经济开支也没有商量。庞秀芳便建议她，家庭要有个小计划，开支要商量，一家人才能搞好团结。最后，大家一致认识到，必须以民主团结的新家庭代替不合理的封建家长制的旧家庭；要达到这个目的，首先必须积极参加劳动，努力建设社会主义，搞好公社，搞好集体福利事业。
