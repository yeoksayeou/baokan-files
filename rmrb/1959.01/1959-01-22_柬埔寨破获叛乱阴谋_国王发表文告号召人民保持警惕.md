Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 20th: The King of Cambodia announced in a proclamation to the nation on the evening of the 20th that a conspiracy by a small group of Cambodians, under the direction of a foreign group, to endanger national security, has been uncovered and swiftly suppressed.

The proclamation pointed out that the purpose of this conspiracy was to "undermine the neutral position desired by our people, and the most despicable thing is to attempt to sell our country to foreign countries. If this conspiracy succeeds, our country will become a true satellite of these countries."

The proclamation said, "The leader of this conspiracy, Sang Sary, attempted to establish an opposition party in the country. At the same time, his accomplices actively, but very secretly, worked on compatriots, civil servants, and soldiers in order to make them leave the motherland and, with the help of foreign manpower and weapons, deploy plans to attack their own country from abroad. The traitor Son Ngoc Thanh is leading this conspiracy from the outside."

The proclamation announced the arrest of five accomplices of Sang Sary and the seizure of very important documents regarding this conspiracy. Sang Sary fled from his residence. The police are currently searching for him.

The proclamation calls on Cambodians to remain calm and vigilant against the anti-national criminal conspiracy of traitors who are listening to certain foreign governments.

According to the "Cambodian Situation" weekly in its special edition published this afternoon, the action to arrest the conspirators was decided by the King on the evening of the 19th when he received a formal request from the Chief of General Staff of the Royal Armed Forces, Major General Lon Nol, to arrest Sang Sary.

The newspaper reported that on the morning of the 20th, police and paratroopers surrounded Sang Sary's residence. As a result of the search, the accomplices of this "Bangkok figure" were discovered and arrested, but this "Bangkok figure" and his assistant Chau Boreth were not found.

The newspaper said that the documents and plans seized from the conspirators arrested at Sang Sary's home clearly illustrate the criminal activities carried out by this traitor and his accomplices against the country.

    柬埔寨破获叛乱阴谋
    国王发表文告号召人民保持警惕
    新华社金边20日电　柬埔寨国王在20日晚间向全国发表的文告宣布，一小撮柬埔寨人在一个外国集团指使下进行危害国家安全的阴谋，已经被揭露和迅速镇压了。
    文告中指出，这个阴谋的目的在于“破坏我国人民所希望的中立立场，而最卑鄙的就是企图把我们国家出卖给外国。假如这个阴谋得逞，我国就会成为这些国家的真正卫星国”。
    文告说，“这次阴谋的领导者桑·萨里企图在国内建立一个反对党，同时他的同谋者积极地、但却非常秘密地对同胞、文职人员和军人进行工作，以便使他们离开祖国，并且在外国的人力和武器帮助下，在外国部署进攻他们自己的国家的计划。叛徒山玉成就是从外部领导这个阴谋的。”
    文告宣布逮捕了桑·萨里的五个同谋者，并且缴获了关于这次阴谋的非常重要的文件。桑·萨里从他的住所逃跑了。目前警察正在搜索中。
    文告号召柬埔寨人对听命于某些外国政府的叛徒的反国家罪恶阴谋保持冷静和警惕。
    据“柬埔寨现状”周刊在它今天下午发表的特刊中说，逮捕这次阴谋犯的行动是国王在19日晚间接到皇家军队总参谋长朗诺少将正式提出逮捕桑·萨里的要求时决定的。
    报纸报道说，20日上午，警察和伞兵包围了桑·萨里的住宅，搜查的结果，发现和逮捕了这位“曼谷人物”的同谋者，但是这位“曼谷人物”和他的助手肖·博雷却没有被找到。
    报纸说，从桑·萨里家里逮捕的阴谋者身上查获的文件和计划，清楚地说明了这个叛徒和他的同谋者对国家进行的犯罪活动。
