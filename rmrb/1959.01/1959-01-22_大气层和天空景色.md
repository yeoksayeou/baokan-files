	Atmosphere and Sky Scenery

	In the article "Earth's 'Veil' - The Atmosphere" (January 19th of this newspaper), it was mentioned that if Earth did not have an atmosphere, the scenes of day and night would be very different from what they are now. Some readers asked, how do day and night on Earth differ from day and night on other celestial bodies in the solar system? Below is a reply written by Bian Depei of the Beijing Planetarium.

	The atmosphere is closely related to the scenery of day and night on celestial bodies. If Earth did not have an atmosphere to scatter light, we would not understand what dawn and dusk are; it would either be daytime with the sun or nighttime without the sun. We would also not see the azure sky, and it would be a dark expanse regardless of day or night. The azure sky is not, as some people imagine, a "background" located behind the sun, but a semi-transparent veil located around the Earth. We know that sunlight is composed of seven monochromatic lights: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, cyan, and violet. When sunlight passes through the air layer, air molecules, dust, and water vapor particles scatter it in all directions. However, the degree to which each color of light is scattered is different, depending on the size of the particles being illuminated. For particles the size of air molecules, blue light is mainly scattered, causing the sky to appear azure. This scattered light is very strong, preventing us from seeing the stars that are still in the sky during the day. At night, due to the atmosphere's scattering of starlight, the sky is not completely dark, but as it was written in elementary school textbooks in the past: "Copper nails on a bluestone slab."

	Earth's atmosphere becomes thinner the higher it is from the ground, so its ability to scatter sunlight also becomes weaker the higher it is. If we could board a helicopter and keep ascending, we would find that the higher we rise, the dimmer the light becomes. If we rise beyond the atmosphere, the sky would become a dark expanse. The situation is very different on those celestial bodies that have no atmosphere or whose atmospheres are very different from Earth's.

	The moon can be said to have no atmosphere, so the contrast between light and darkness is extremely obvious. It has no "dawn" or "dusk." Even during the day, places directly illuminated by sunlight reflect dazzling light, while places not illuminated by sunlight are pitch black. There, there is only light or darkness, and there is no shadow between light and darkness as there is on Earth. Moreover, even during the day, the sky is still pitch black, forming the spectacle of the sun and stars juxtaposed in the sky.

	Mercury is very likely to have no atmosphere, so its situation is not much different from that of the moon. However, Mercury always faces the sun with the same side. The hemisphere illuminated by the sun is always daytime, with temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius, while the other hemisphere experiences a cold, long night.

	Venus has a dense atmosphere around it. However, this atmosphere is too dense, severely blocking the sun's rays. Therefore, if there were living beings on Venus, they would not be able to see the sun clearly.

	The length of a day on Mars is about the same as on Earth, only half an hour longer than ours. However, since its atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, the scenery during the day on Mars is far inferior to that on Earth.

	The rotation periods of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all shorter than Earth's rotation period. For example, the shortest rotation period of Jupiter is less than ten hours. Day and night on these planets truly "come quickly and go quickly." Especially since they are farther from the sun, they receive less sunlight, and the light scattered by the atmosphere is weaker, making the daytime light even weaker.

### 大气层和天空景色

    大气层和天空景色
    “地球的‘帷幕’——大气层”一文（1月19日本报）中说，如果地球没有大气层，那末白天和黑夜的情景就同现在大不相同。有的读者问，地球上的白天和黑夜同太阳系的其他天体的白天和黑夜有什么不同呢？下面便是北京天文馆卞德培同志写的答复。
    大气层同天体上白天和黑夜的景色有密切关系。地球如果没有大气层对光的散射作用，我们将不懂得什么是黎明，什么是黄昏，要就是有太阳的白天，要就是无太阳的黑夜。也将看不到蔚蓝色的天空，不论日夜都是黑黝黝的一片。蔚蓝色的天空并不像有些人所想像的那样是位于太阳之后的“背景”，而是位于地球周围的半透明的帷幕。我们知道，太阳光是由七种单色光：红、橙、黄、绿、蓝、青、紫组成的；当太阳光穿过空气层时，空气分子、尘埃和水汽质点就把它散射到各个方向去。但是，各种颜色的光被散射的程度各不相同，这是取决于被照射的质点的大小的。对于像空气分子那样大小的质点来说，其中主要是蓝色光线被散射，以致使天空呈现出蔚蓝的颜色。这种散射光辉很强，是它阻碍了我们看到白天仍旧在天空中的点点繁星。到了晚上，由于大气层对星光的散射作用，天空也不是漆黑一片，而像从前小学教科书上所写的那样：“青石板上钉铜钉”。
    地球的大气是离地面愈高愈稀薄，因此散射太阳光的能力也是愈高愈微弱。假设我们能够乘上直升飞机一直上升的话，就会发现升得愈高光线愈暗；要是升到超过了大气层，天空就会变成黑黝黝的一片了。而在那些没有大气或者大气同地球很不相同的天体上，情况就大不相同。
    月球可说是没有大气，因此，光亮同黑暗的对比极其明显。它没有“黎明”和“黄昏”。就是在白天，被太阳光直接照射到的地方，反射出令人目眩的光亮；而在太阳光照射不到的地方，却是漆黑一片。在那里只有明或暗，并没有像地球上间于明暗之间的阴影的存在。并且，就是在白天，天空还是漆黑一片，形成太阳和星星同时并列在天空的奇观。
    水星很可能是没有大气的，因此，它的情况就和月球不相上下了。但是，水星永远以同一面对着太阳，在被太阳照射着的半球上永远是白天，温度高达摄氏四百度，而在另外的半球上却是寒冷的漫漫长夜。
    金星周围有着浓厚的大气层。但是，这个大气层过于浓厚了，严重地阻挡了太阳光的照射。因此，如果金星上有生物存在的话，它们也是无法清晰地看到太阳的。
    火星上一天的长短倒是和我们地球差不多，只比我们多了半个小时。但是，由于它周围大气层比我们地球的稀薄得多，火星上白天的景色也远逊于我们地球。
    木星、土星、天王星和海王星等的自转周期都小于我们地球的自转周期，如最短的木星自转周期，只有十个小时还不到。在这些行星上的白天、黑夜，那真是“来也匆匆，去也匆匆”。特别是由于它们离太阳较远，得到的太阳光更少，大气层散射的光也更弱，白天光亮也就更弱了。
