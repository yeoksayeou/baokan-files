Great Victory Welcomes Spring
——Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Huaihai Campaign
Wu Qiang

About a month after capturing Jinan and capturing Wang Yaowu alive, around the end of November 1948, our troops advanced from the Lunan mountain area towards the Xin'an Town and Pao Che area along the Longhai Railway.

It was around ten o'clock in the morning, and the sun was hidden behind the clouds. With the sharp northwest wind at our backs and the faint sound of artillery ahead, we walked briskly along the mountain path.

A new campaign was about to begin.

In each of our hearts, there was the joy of a new battle and the hope of a new victory. We imagined: like the Suiqi campaign and the Jinan campaign, let's annihilate another 100,000 enemy troops!

Our planned target was the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's Huang Botao Corps.

We had crossed paths with this enemy, Huang Botao, three times. Once in August 1946, when he advanced towards the Gaoyou and Shaobei lines in Suzhong; once in May 1947, when he reinforced Zhang Lingfu, who was trapped in Menglianggu; and once in July 1948, when he reinforced the Qu Shounian Corps, he came to Diqiudian, east of Longwangdian. We fought him all three times, but we never defeated him completely. Third time's the charm, and everyone vowed this time! We must annihilate the Huang Botao Corps.

Our steps were full of energy. We climbed uphill quickly, trotted downhill, and flew across the plains.

We had just rested in Zhaozhuang, about forty li north of Xin'an Town, when we heard the news that "Huang Botao has run to Xuzhou."

"Ah? Did he slip away?"

We were surprised, annoyed, and disappointed, and opened our backpacks to sleep.

I had only closed my eyes for the time it took to smoke a cigarette when I suddenly heard the sound of people and horses bustling inside and outside the village. Just as I was about to get up to see what was happening, the communications soldier shouted loudly at the door:

"Assemble and depart immediately!"

The pursuit troops were divided into several routes on the railways, highways, and fields, and in the dim moonlight, they rushed straight towards the Yunhe (Grand Canal) Railway Station.

As dawn approached, we reached the edge of the Grand Canal.

The rapid current of the Grand Canal rushed and flew like shooting arrows. The bridge over the Grand Canal was destroyed by Huang Botao. Some bridge planks were broken, some were scorched, and some were still burning. A regiment abandoned by the enemy surrendered their weapons near Pao Che. The wounded and corpses abandoned on the bridge were lying across the bridge, some were on fire, crawling and howling, and some fell into the Grand Canal along with the broken bridge planks.

In broad daylight, under the bombing and strafing of a large number of enemy planes, the troops crossed to the west bank of the river. Less than thirty li down the river, the scattered gunfire gradually intensified. We saw a newly printed victory report, which said "Huang Botao's Corps is trapped in our army's tight encirclement in the Nianzhuangxu area." Our pace quickened. Many soldiers took off their newly put-on cotton trousers, carried them on their shoulders, and ran forward in single trousers and shorts, with bare legs and unbuttoned coats.

"Another 100,000, no problem." I said to myself.

The campaign unfolded.

Day and night, the sound of gunfire continued every minute and every second. The dust and sand whipped up by the cold wind mixed with gunpowder smoke, rising into the sky. Beacon fires ignited in all directions on the plains. The land shook, and villages, trees, and houses trembled. A vast battlefield was like an erupting volcano.

After ten days and ten nights of hard fighting, by dawn on November 20, the firelight illuminated Nianzhuangxu, the surroundings of Nianzhuangxu, and the sky above. At this time, the Huang Botao Corps was completely annihilated.

"Another 100,000!" The development of the battle coincided with our wishes.

According to the rules of life after the Laiwu, Menglianggu, and Jinan campaigns, we needed to carry out post-war recuperation. That is to say, we had to go through a month or half a month to twenty days of post-war work before fighting another battle.

On the afternoon of the same day that the Huang Botao Corps was annihilated, many people who had stayed up for several nights did not get enough sleep before the troops moved out under the strafing and bombing of airplanes to face new combat missions.

"Can we have double happiness and another 100,000?"

After winning a victory, we felt happy and comfortable. Although we had not been able to rest properly for more than ten days, our eyes were bloodshot, and our whole bodies were dry and itchy, we walked even more briskly.

The troops spread out in the wilderness. Horses galloped, people ran. We walked from afternoon to dusk, from dusk to night, from night to dawn. At dawn, we rested, ate, and then continued walking. Once on the road, we were running and rushing again.

I don't know where that energy came from. At this time, people were really like iron.

On a pitch-black night, we were wading through a cold, shallow river. Some fell into the water, some held hands to form a rope and waded to the other side. At this moment, news came from behind: The Huang Wei Corps was surrounded by the Second Field Army in the Shuangduiji area. Immediately, cheers erupted on the river and on both banks.

We seemed to be studying mathematics, and we loved to calculate numbers. Someone said: "One hundred thousand plus another hundred thousand!"

After crossing the Hui River and then the Xie River, the troops spread out on the north bank of the Fei River, blocking the enemy reinforcements for the Huang Wei Corps.

Sawing trees, digging soil, carrying door panels, and setting up barricades, the soldiers built sturdy and elaborate bunker complexes.

There was a Ninth Company, which had just been promoted from a local regiment after fighting in Jinan. In front of the Shiqiaozi village, they fought a regiment of the enemy for seven days and seven nights. The enemy attacked them thirteen times, and they remained unmoved like a mountain. The positions and villages were always in their hands. Under their fire, six or seven hundred enemies fell.

An enemy shell once hit the top of a bunker, and the seven soldiers in the bunker were all crushed under tree trunks, wooden boards, and mud. When the enemy was about to attack them, they ignored the pain, dug through the mud, and lifted the wooden boards and tree trunks. They stood up, wiped the blood and mud off their guns, and once again defeated the ferocious enemy.

The blocking battle was fierce, and the Huang Wei Corps was also at death's door. I remember it was noon on December 1 when the victory report came, saying that our army had liberated Xuzhou, and Du Yuming had escaped with three corps, and our army was intercepting and pursuing them.

Could there be another three or four hundred thousand? Our throats grew larger and larger, and we speculated on the development of the battle situation.

The next day's victory report was: The enemies who escaped from Xuzhou were all surrounded in the Yongcheng and Qinglongji areas.

The red characters on the victory report flashed with dazzling light. I looked up at the sky, and a colorful glow ignited on the horizon. I felt as if I were living in a dream.

On the evening of December 16, we passed Shuangduiji.

The Huang Wei Corps dug its own grave here. The market town, originally with more than two hundred households, was now a pile of ashes, rubble, and mounds, everywhere were trenches and caves, the embers were still burning, the blood had congealed into ice, and the stench of corpses emanated from the ash heap. The cold wind swept through, and black ash, yellow soil, and gray smoke swirled and spiraled in the sky above, and this post-war battlefield scene made people grit their teeth and arouse infinite hatred for the enemy in their hearts.

On New Year's Day 1949, goose feather snow flew all over the sky, and we stepped on the icy and muddy road, heading towards the battle target of Yongcheng and Qinglongji. There, hundreds of thousands of enemy troops, trapped in an iron barrel, were waiting for the end on the line of death.

The earth was covered with silver clothes, and the sun shone on the vast plain.

The troops, carrying the joy of annihilating two groups of 200,000 enemies, advanced rapidly towards the last point on this vast battlefield. Men and women, old, young, and middle-aged, large teams of laborers, carrying loads, carrying poles, and pushing carts, transported grain, steamed buns, pancakes, Chinese cabbage, whole pigs, and whole sheep from all directions to the front lines, so that the invincible and fearless soldiers could have a full meal to kill the enemy.

The final battle of the campaign arrived.

The enemy was cut off on land, and large groups of aircraft were arranged in the sky, one-headed, two-headed, three-headed, five-headed, double-bodied, all dispatched. But how could they save their tragic ending?

On the night of January 9, countless cannons opened their huge mouths, pouring out rain-like shells, and raging fire burned on the enemy's densely populated villages and ground. Bullets flew like locusts in the enemy's crowd. The surging attacking troops, like thousands of sharp arrows, shot into the enemy's positions, and the sound of charging and killing echoed in the cold sky.

Large groups of prisoners walked out of the sea of ​​fire. From the night of the general attack to the end of the battle the next day, it never stopped. The fields turned into a sea of ​​people, rising up waves.

At ten o'clock in the morning on January 10, when the winter sun hung in the southeast corner, a major battle ended victoriously. The great victory ushered in the spring of 1949, and the vast Huaihai Plain was free from war.

One hundred thousand, another hundred thousand, and then four hundred thousand! More than sixty days of fighting annihilated six hundred thousand enemies.

What else is needed? We continued to march south on the road on the south bank of the Huai River. Realizing the slogan put forward by the Party Central Committee, "Cross the Yangtze River and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," was our immediate task.

    大捷迎春
    ——纪念淮海战役十周年
    吴强
    打下了济南府，活捉了王耀武一个月以后，也就是1948年11月底的时候，我们的队伍从鲁南山区向陇海路上新安镇、炮车一线挺进。
    是上午十点钟光景，太阳隐在云后。背着凌厉的西北风，迎着隐隐的炮声，我们轻快地走在山道上。
    新的战役又要开始了。
    我们每个人的心里，激荡着新的战斗的欢乐，新的胜利的希望。我们这样设想：像睢?战役和济南战役那样，再来个歼敌十万吧！
    我们预定的攻击对象，是蒋介石匪军的黄伯韬兵团。
    黄伯韬这个敌人和我们交过三次手。一次是1946年8月，他向苏中的高邮、邵北一线进犯，一次是1947年5月，他增援过困在孟良崮的张灵甫，一次是1948年7月，增援区寿年兵团，他到过龙王店东边的帝丘店。这三次，我们都跟他打过，但都没有把他打倒打烂。事不过三，这一次，大家都发出了誓言！一定消灭黄伯韬兵团。
    脚下劲头很足，上山快步，下山小跑，到了平原地就像飞一样了。
    在新安镇以北四十来里路的赵庄，刚歇下来，就听到消息，说“黄伯韬跑到徐州去了。”
    “啊？给他蹓掉啦？”
    我们惊讶，懊恼，失望，打开背包睡觉了。
    我闭上眼只有吸完一支烟的工夫，忽然听到庄内、庄外人马杂沓的声音，正要起来看看，通讯员在门口高声叫道：
      “马上集合出发！”
    追击部队在铁路、公路上，在田野里分成好几路，在暗淡的月光下面，直向运河车站奔去。
    天近拂晓的时候，我们赶到运河边上。
    运河的激流像射箭似的狂驶飞奔，运河上的大桥给黄伯韬炸坏了，有些桥板断了，有些桥板烧焦了，有些桥板还在燃烧。敌人丢弃下来的一个团，在炮车附近缴了枪，丢弃在桥上的伤兵、尸体，有的横倒在桥上，有的身上着了火，爬动着，嚎叫着，有的跟着烧断了的桥板，一同跌落到运河里去。
    大白天，在大批敌机的轰炸、扫射下面，队伍过到河西，追下去不到三十里，零落的枪声、炮声，渐渐密集起来。看到一个部队刚刚印出来的捷报，说“黄伯韬兵团在碾庄圩一带，陷入了我军密密重围”。我们的脚步加快，好些战士把新上身的棉裤脱下来，背在肩膀上，穿着单裤、短裤，裸着腿，解开上衣钮扣，敞着胸口向前奔跑。
      “再来个十万，没有问题了。”我心里说。
    战役展开了。
    白天、夜晚，枪炮声分秒不断，寒风卷起的尘沙和着炮烟，腾向上空，烽火在平原上的四面八方燃起，土地震动，村庄、树木、房屋发着颤抖，一片广阔的战场，像一座爆发了的火山似的。
    十天十夜的苦战以后，到11月20日侵晨，火光映红了碾庄圩、碾庄圩的四周和上空，这一时候，黄伯韬兵团彻底消灭了。
    “又是十万！”战事的发展巧合了我们的愿望。
    照莱芜、孟良崮、济南等等战役以后的生活规律，我们需要进行战后休整。就是说，得经过一个月或者半个月二十天的战后工作，再打下一仗。
    就在黄伯韬兵团消灭的当天下午，熬战了好几个通宵的许多人，不曾睡足一觉，队伍就冒着飞机的扫射、轰炸，迎着新的战斗任务出动了。
      “还能双喜临门，又来个十万吗？”
    打了胜仗以后，心情欢快舒畅。虽然十来天没有能够好好休息，眼睛熬得通红，全身干燥发痒，走起路来却更加轻快。
    队伍在原野上展开，马在飞驰，人在奔跑，下午走到黄昏，黄昏走到黑夜，黑夜走到天明，天明，歇歇脚，吃了饭，接着又走。一上路，就又是飞奔猛赶。
    不知道那股劲头是哪里来的，这时候的人，真像是铁打似的。
    在一个伸手不见五指的黑夜里，我们正在涉过一道冰冷的浅水河，有的跌倒在水里，有的手拉着手结成一条绳子向对岸徒涉，正是这个时候，背后传来消息：黄维兵团在双堆集一带，给第二野战军包围住了。于是，一片欢呼的声音，在河面上、河两岸沸腾起来。
    我们仿佛是学数学的，爱计算数目字，有人说：“一个十万再加一个十万！”
    过了浍河，又过了澥河，队伍展开在淝河北岸，阻击着增援黄维兵团的敌人。
    锯树、挖土、抬门板，设置鹿砦，战士们筑起了坚固、精致的地堡群。
    有一个第九连，是打过济南以后，刚刚从地方团上升来的。他们在石桥子村庄面前，和一个团的敌人连战了七天七夜，敌人对他们进攻了十三次，他们像一座山似的，屹然不动，阵地、村庄一直在他们手里。在他们的射击之下，六七百个敌人倒了下去。
    敌人的一颗炮弹，曾经击中在地堡顶上，地堡里的七个战士，全给压在树干、木板和泥土下面。在敌人快攻到他们面前的时候，他们不顾伤痛、扒开泥土，顶起木板、树干，站了起来，抹去枪上的血和泥土，再一次地打垮了凶恶的敌人。
    阻击战打得正猛，黄维兵团也正到了死亡临头的当儿，我记得是12月1日的中午，捷报飞来，说我军解放了徐州，杜聿明带三个兵团逃走，我军正在拦打穷追。
    还能再来个三个、四个十万？喉咙越吃越大了，我们推想到战局的发展。
    第二天的捷报是：逃出徐州的敌人全部给围在永城、青龙集一带。
    捷报上的红字，闪动着耀眼的光芒。我抬头看看天，天际烧起了一片彩霞，我觉得我仿佛是生活在梦里。
    12月16日的黄昏，我们过双堆集。
    黄维兵团在这里挖掘了自己的坟墓。原有两百多户人家的集镇，现在是一片灰烬、瓦砾、土丘，到处是壕沟、地窟，残火还在燃烧，血，凝成了冰冻，尸臭从灰堆里发出来。寒风掠过，黑灰、黄土、灰烟在这里的上空飞旋盘绕，战后的这种战场景象，使人不由地咬紧牙根，在心胸里激起对敌人的无限憎恨。
    1949年元旦，鹅毛大雪漫天飞舞，我们踏上冰滑泥泞的路，奔向永城、青龙集的战斗目标。那里，死困在铁桶里的敌人几十万人马，在死亡线上等待着末日的到来。
    大地披上了银色新装，阳光洒在大平原上。
    队伍载负着消灭两个二十万敌人的欢乐，向这个辽阔的战场上的最后一点飞速挺进。男男女女的，老年的、青年、壮年的大队民工，挑担子的、抬扛的、推车子的，从四面八方运来粮食、馒头、煎饼、大白菜、整猪全羊，送到火线上，让无敌无畏的战士们饱餐杀敌。
    战役的最后战斗到来了。
    敌人在陆地上绝了路，天空里排列起大队机群，一个头的，两个头的，三个头的，五个头的，双身的，全都出动了。但是，他们怎能挽回他们的悲惨的结局呢？
    1月9日夜晚，无数门大炮张开了巨口，倾泻出暴雨般的炮弹，烈火在敌人麇集的村庄、地面上燃烧起来，枪弹飞蝗一般地在敌人群里飞舞，汹涌的攻击队伍，正如万千支利箭一样，射进敌人的阵地，冲锋喊杀的声浪，回荡在寒空里。
    大队大队的俘虏，从火海里走出来。从夜晚总攻击的时候，到第二天战事结束，一直没有断过，田野里变成了人海，腾起了波浪。
    10日上午十点钟，冬天的太阳挂在东南角上的时候，一场大战胜利结束。大捷迎来了1949年的春天，辽阔广大的淮海平原上，从此没有了战事。
    来个十万，再来个十万，又来了个四十万！六十多天的战斗，消灭了六十万敌人。
    还需要再来个什么？我们在淮河南岸的大路上继续往南行军。实现党中央提出的“打过长江去，活捉蒋介石”的口号，就是我们眼前的事了。
