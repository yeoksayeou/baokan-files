Rice Paddy Fish Farming - A Bumper Harvest of Fish and Rice

Zhejiang Daily News: Last year, the Donghu Farm in Shaoxing County raised fish in rice paddies and achieved a bumper harvest of both fish and rice. In two and a half mu of double-cropped rice paddies, 2,230 carp were released. As a result, not only did the two and a half mu of rice achieve a high yield of an average of 1,616 jin per mu, but also 1,085 jin of freshwater fish were caught, averaging 434 jin per mu, worth 86.8 yuan.

The practice of Donghu Farm proves that raising fish in rice paddies not only directly increases income, but also indirectly benefits rice growth in many ways. First, fish like to eat weeds, and fish manure is a good phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer. Fish groups migrate and forage, which can play a role in weeding, loosening the soil, and fertilizing. Second, fish prey on rice leaf rollers, rice stem borers, mosquitoes, mosquito larvae, and other larvae in the field, which eliminates pests and protects rice seedlings. Third, the normal movement of fish groups can promote ventilation of densely planted rice seedlings. Therefore, rice paddy fish farming is: an automatic weeding tool, a mobile insect catching net, an automatic cultivator, and a fertilizer manufacturing machine.

In terms of breeding techniques: they selected two and a half mu of paddy fields with convenient water sources and built field ridges one and a half chi high around them. Before the rice was planted, three fish pits were dug, two and a half chi deep, five chi wide, and seven chi long, and a cross-shaped fish ditch was dug, seven to eight cun deep and one chi wide, connecting the pits. A grass shed three chi high was built on the pits to cover them, preventing high temperatures in the field water in summer. The field surface was leveled to ensure smooth fish movement. Sufficient base fertilizer was also applied to keep water in the field. When fertilizing, cultivating, weeding, and applying pesticides, the field water was drained, and the fish swam into the pits. The operation was the same as in ordinary fields. (Attached picture)

### 稻田养鱼　鱼米丰收

    稻田养鱼　鱼米丰收
    浙江日报消息　绍兴县东湖农场去年在稻田里养鱼，获得鱼米双丰收。二亩五分连作稻田里，放养了二千二百三十尾鲤鱼，收获结果，不仅二亩五分水稻获得了每亩平均一千六百十六斤的高产，而且捕获了淡水鱼一千零八十五斤，平均亩产四百三十四斤，价值八十六元八角。
    从东湖农场的实践证明：稻田养鱼不仅直接增加收入，而且间接对水稻生长有很多好处。第一，鱼类喜吃杂草，鱼粪是很好的磷氮质肥料，鱼群洄游觅食，因此可以起到除草、松土、增肥的作用；第二，鱼类捕食田间油虫、螟蛾、蚊子、孑孓以及其他幼虫，有消除虫害，保护稻苗的作用；第三，鱼群的正常游动，又可以促进密植稻苗的通风。因此，稻田养鱼是：自动的除草工具，活动的捕虫网，是自动的中耕器，又是肥料制造机。
    在养殖的技术方面：他们选择了水源便利的二亩五分水田，周围筑起一尺五寸高的田塍。在水稻未种以前，掘鱼坑三个，深二尺五寸、阔五尺、长七尺，挖十字形鱼沟一条，深七至八寸，阔一尺，沟通坑，坑连沟。坑上搭高三尺的草棚遮盖，防止夏天田水高温。田面趟平，使鱼游畅通。并施足基肥，保持田面有水。在施肥、耘田、除虫、施药时，放干田水，鱼游入坑中，操作和一般田相同。（附图片）
