South Korea's original "National Security Law" of the Rhee Syngman clique was a reactionary law modeled after Japan's "Public Security Preservation Law." This time, the Rhee Syngman clique, under the pretext of anti-communism, expanded the law from six articles to forty articles, becoming the so-called "New National Security Law." Chapter Two of this law, "Crimes and Punishments," alone has twenty-six articles, tediously stipulating that anyone who assembles, forms associations, organizes groups, or engages in propaganda to oppose Rhee Syngman's "nation" and "government" shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or ten years of imprisonment. In addition, it stipulates that soldiers and civil servants who resist Rhee Syngman shall be punished.

Responsible persons from various South Korean newspapers and periodicals have issued statements saying that the "National Security Law" amendment is a law that "severely restricts the rights and freedoms of the people and social activities." The "Kyonghyang Shinmun" said that this fascist law, under the pretext of anti-communism, "obliterates the minimum level of democracy and basic human rights." Many people in South Korea worry that, with the upcoming general election scheduled for the spring of 1960, the Rhee Syngman clique will invoke this law to persecute opposition parties and the people, and take the opportunity to eliminate dissidents within its own ranks. Therefore, a wave of anger against this fascist law has emerged in South Korea.

Under opposition from all sides, the Rhee Syngman clique finally resorted to fascist means on December 24th of last year, dispatching a large number of armed police and plainclothes special agents to beat and drag out seventy members of the opposition Democratic Party and imprison them in the basement of the National Assembly, where members of Rhee Syngman's Liberal Party, who were all of one mind, passed this notorious law.

### 南朝鲜的“新国家保安法”

    南朝鲜的“新国家保安法”
    李承晚集团原来的“国家保安法”就是仿照日本的“治安维持法”制定的反动法令。李承晚集团这次以反共为借口把这项法令由六条修改扩充为四十条，成为所谓“新国家保安法”。这项法令的第二章“罪和刑”就有二十六条，繁琐地规定着：凡是为反对李承晚的“国家”和“政府”而集会、结社、组织团体的和进行宣传的都要被判处死刑、无期徒刑或十年的徒刑，此外还规定军人和公务员等如果反抗李承晚就处以刑罚。
    南朝鲜各报刊负责人曾经发表声明说，“国家保安法”修正案是“极度的限制国民的权利和自由以及社会活动”的法令。“京乡新闻”说，这个法西斯法令以反共为借口“抹煞了最低限度的民主和基本人权”。南朝鲜的许多人担心，由于预定在1960年春天举行的下届大选将要到来，李承晚集团会援引这项法令来迫害反对党和人民，并且乘机清除它内部的异己分子。因此，在南朝鲜出现了反对这个法西斯法令的怒潮。
    在各方面的反对下，李承晚集团最后在去年12月24日竟使出了法西斯手段，出动大量的武装警察和便衣特务把反对党民主党的七十名议员加以毒打并拖出会场囚禁在国会的地下室内，由清一色的李承晚自由党的议员通过了这项臭名昭彰的法令。
