　　Naval pentathlon is a rich and vibrant national defense sports program. Regularly participating in this activity can teach people some basic military nautical knowledge and skills, and cultivate people's noble qualities of courage and tenacity.

　　Naval pentathlon can be carried out in coastal, lakeside, riverside, and riverine locations with relatively wide water surfaces. China has a long coastline, many rivers and lakes, and a vast water area, making it very suitable for carrying out this activity. In China, naval pentathlon began in the winter of 1952. At that time, the Central National Defense Sports Club opened the first batch of amateur naval sampan instructor training classes in Beihai Park, Beijing. This was the beginning of nautical sports in Beijing and the whole country. In 1953, nautical activities were also held in Qingdao, training a group of amateur instructors for the city. The activities at that time were relatively simple, limited to learning some basic theoretical knowledge of the navy and navigation, as well as the operational techniques of rowing and sailing naval sampans. In 1955, the Qingdao Nautical Club trained a group of full-time coaches for various places. After that, nautical activities gradually spread on a larger scale. In 1956, naval pentathlon developed very rapidly. Nautical clubs were successively established in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and other places. In particular, after the first naval pentathlon competition was held in Qingdao on August 1, 1956, the scale of naval pentathlon gradually expanded, and the technical level also improved. Activities such as heaving lines, tug-of-war, climbing the mooring pole, semaphore communication, combined swimming, shooting, and knotting were added. Now, twenty-two provinces and cities across the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong, have launched mass naval pentathlon activities, and tens of thousands of naval pentathlon enthusiasts have emerged.

　　As naval pentathlon has gradually penetrated the masses in China, competition activities have also increased, and the level of sports has also been continuously improved. Two large-scale naval pentathlon competitions were held in 1956 and 1958. The first was held in Qingdao in 1956, with 211 male and female athletes from 10 representative teams from 5 provinces and cities, including Qingdao, Shanghai, and Beijing participating. The competition events included sampan rowing, sampan sailing, semaphore communication, tug-of-war, heaving lines, climbing the mooring pole, and combined sampan rowing and sailing. This competition was the first review of the achievements of China's nautical sports. In the summer of 1958, another national naval pentathlon competition was held in Qingdao. This competition was larger than the first, with 255 athletes from 15 provinces and cities participating. This competition achieved good results. The top six results in the heaving lines competition all exceeded the best result of 33.60 meters created by Chinese athlete Zou Chengchuan in the second International Naval Pentathlon Competition in 1957. The result of the first place, Han Zhaoshan, reached 37.40 meters. In the naval sports competitions in 1958, many excellent athletes emerged, and dozens of athletes have reached the sports master standard for sampan rowing and heaving lines. Guangzhou athlete Ouyang Shi threw the heaving line to 46 meters in an annual competition, exceeding the highest score in the heaving line competition in previous international competitions.

　　Chinese nautical athletes have also achieved good results in international competitions. In the International Naval Pentathlon Competition held in Poland in 1956, the Chinese team was behind in the total score, but won the first place in two individual events, climbing the mooring pole and shooting. In 1957, the Chinese team participated in the second International Naval Pentathlon Competition. Among the six participating countries, the Chinese team ranked third in the total score, second only to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, and won the first place in the heaving line event. In August 1958, the Chinese team participated for the third time in the International Naval Pentathlon Competition held in the port of Odessa, Soviet Union. This time, the Chinese team's results surpassed the strong Bulgarian team and won the second place in the total score. In the two very difficult individual events of crossing the river using ropes and the 10,000-meter sampan rowing, Chinese athletes exerted their greatest efforts and, after fierce competition, finally defeated the strong opponent Soviet team and won the first place.

    航海多项运动

    航海多项运动是一个内容丰富、生动活泼的国防体育项目。经常参加这项活动，能使人学会一些初步的军事航海知识和技术，能培养人们勇敢顽强的高尚品质。
    凡在沿海、濒湖、临江、靠河等水面比较宽阔的地点都可以开展航海多项运动。我国海岸线长，江河湖泊多，水面很广，很有条件开展这项活动。在我国航海多项运动是1952年冬才开始的。当时的中央国防体育俱乐部在首都北海公园开办了第一批海军舢舨业余辅导员训练班。这是北京市也是全国航海运动的萌芽。1953年又在青岛举办了航海活动，为该市培养了一批业余辅导员。当时的活动内容比较简单，仅限于学习一些海军和航海的基本理论知识，以及有关海军舢舨荡桨和驶帆的操作技术。1955年青岛航海俱乐部为各地培训了一批专职教练。这以后航海活动便逐渐在更大范围内开展起来。1956年航海多项运动发展得很迅速。广州、上海、南京、杭州、武汉等地都相继建立了航海俱乐部，特别是1956年8月1日在青岛举行了第一届航海多项运动竞赛之后，航海多项运动的开展规模逐渐扩大，技术水平也有所提高。又增加了撇缆、拔河、攀登系艇杆、手旗通讯、综合游泳、射击、结绳等活动内容。现在全国已有北京、上海、江苏、广东等二十二个省市开展了群众性的航海多项运动，并且涌现了成千上万的航海多项运动积极分子。
    由于航海多项运动在我国逐渐深入群众，竞赛活动也随之增加，运动水平也在不断提高。在1956到1958年先后举行了两次规模较大的航海多项运动竞赛。第一次是1956年在青岛举行的，有青岛、上海、北京等五个省市十个代表队的二百一十一名男女运动员参加。竞赛项目包括舢舨荡桨、舢舨驶帆、手旗通讯、拔河、撇缆、攀登系艇杆、舢舨荡桨与驶帆综合竞赛等。这次比赛第一次检阅了我国航海运动的成就。1958年夏在青岛又举行了一次全国性的航海多项运动竞赛。这次比第一次规模大，共有十五个省市的二百五十五名运动员参加。这次比赛取得了很好的成绩，撇缆比赛前六名的成绩都超过了中国运动员邹成传1957年在第二届国际航海多项运动竞赛中创造的三三点六○公尺的最好成绩，第一名韩照善的成绩达到三七点四○公尺。1958年在历次航海运动比赛中，出现了很多优秀运动员，已有几十名运动员达到舢舨荡桨和撇缆的运动健将标准。广州运动员欧阳狮在年终的一次竞赛中把缆头撇到四十六公尺，超过了历届国际比赛中撇缆比赛的最高成绩。
    我国航海运动员在国际竞赛中也取得较好的成绩。1956年在波兰举行的国际航海多项运动竞赛中，中国队总分虽然落后，但获得了攀登系艇杆和射击两个单项比赛的第一名。1957年中国队参加了第二届国际航海多项运动竞赛，在六个参加国家中，中国队仅次于苏联、保加利亚获总分第三，并获得撇缆单项第一名。1958年8月，中国队第三次参加在苏联敖得萨港举行的国际航海多项运动竞赛，这次中国队的成绩超过实力雄厚的保加利亚队获得总分第二名，在利用绳索渡河和一万公尺舢舨荡桨两个难度很大的单项比赛中，我国运动员发挥了最大的干劲，经过剧烈的竞争，最后战胜了强劲的对手苏联队获第一名。（附图片）
