New Tasks for Hygiene Work
Hua Ren

After the rural communes were established, new tasks were also presented for hygiene work. This means strengthening the management of collective hygiene. Run the canteens well so that commune members eat cleanly. Run the nurseries and kindergartens well so that children eat well, sleep well, and are prevented from getting sick... In short, ensure everyone's health so that they can devote themselves to production with peace of mind.

Rural collective hygiene work is indeed unfamiliar to all of us, and there are naturally many difficulties. For example, when it comes to the canteens, hundreds or thousands of people eating together is something that never happened in the countryside in the past. Now, not only must we ensure that all commune members eat their fill, but also that they eat cleanly and hygienically, which is no easy task. As for nurseries, we must not only ensure that children eat well and sleep well, but also prevent diseases well and provide good care when they are sick, so that the children's parents can engage in production with peace of mind, which is also no easy task. But this is only one aspect of the matter. There is another aspect that must also be seen. That is: after communization, the collectivization of rural life has been strengthened. With public canteens, families no longer need to cook. Children enter kindergartens and nurseries and no longer defecate everywhere, which is much cleaner than in the past. Because of these conditions, personal hygiene, family hygiene, and rural collective hygiene work of farmers can be done better than in the past. When looking at something, one must see both aspects of the matter, seeing both the favorable and unfavorable conditions. This is no exception when it comes to rural hygiene work. The Party committee of the Chuanshan People's Commune correctly recognized this point and launched several clean-up campaigns, so that everyone gradually developed the habit of caring about collective hygiene, and the specific measures proposed by the Party committee could be implemented consistently.

The People's Commune is the organizer of the people's production and life, and caring for the collective hygiene of the masses is a glorious task of the commune. In the past, farmers produced individually, based on the family as a unit. If a family had a sick person, the production of the entire family would be affected. Today, if hygiene work is not done well, it will not only affect one family, but a collective. Because, after communization, farmers not only work together, but also eat together. If there is an epidemic of infectious disease, the chances of infection will be greater than in the past. If active measures are not taken, it will directly affect production. In this regard, the Chuanshan Commune also provides us with positive and negative examples. After this commune was first organized, because hygiene work did not keep up, some people got sick, and production was affected. After the Party committee grasped this work, the situation improved, and the winter production task was completed ahead of schedule. From this, it can be seen that managing the collective hygiene of commune members is an important link in the commune's organization of production and must not be ignored.

    卫生工作的新任务
    华仁
    农村公社化以后，给卫生工作也提出了新的任务，这就是要加强集体卫生的管理工作。把食堂办好，叫社员吃得干干净净；把托儿所、幼儿园办好，叫孩子吃好，睡好，防止疾病……一句话，保证大家身体健康，能够安心地投入生产。
    农村的集体卫生工作，对我们大家来说，的确是一个生疏的工作，困难自然很多。比如就食堂来说，上百上千的人在一起吃饭，这是过去农村里从来没有的事。现在不仅要保证所有的社员吃得饱，而且还要吃得干净卫生，这就不是一件易事；再就托儿所来说，我们不仅要孩子吃好、睡好，而且还要防病防得好，有病护理好，以便孩子的父母能够安心生产，这也不是一件易事。但这只是事情的一方面。还有另一方面，也必须看得到。那就是：公社化后，农村生活的集体化加强了；有了公共食堂，家里可以不要炒菜煮饭了；孩子进了幼儿园、托儿所，也不会到处拉屎撒尿，比过去干净多了。因为有了这些条件，农民个人卫生、家庭卫生和农村集体卫生工作，就有可能比过去做得更好。看一件事情，一定要看到事物的两个方面，看到有利条件和不利条件。在农村的卫生工作方面，也不例外。川山人民公社的党委，就是正确地认识了这一点，开展了几次清洁卫生运动，使大家逐步养成了关心集体卫生的习惯，党委所提出的具体措施才能坚持贯彻。
    人民公社是人民的生产和生活的组织者，关怀群众的集体卫生工作，就是公社的一个光荣的任务。过去，农民是以家庭为单位，单独进行生产。一个家庭，假若有了病人，全家的生产就会受到影响。今天，假若卫生工作没做好，就不只影响一个家庭，而是一个集体。因为，公社化以后，农民不仅在一起劳动，而且在一起吃饭，如有流行性的传染病发生，传染的机会就会比过去更多，如不采取积极措施，就会直接影响到生产。在这方面，川山公社也给我们提供了正面和反面的例证。这个公社刚组织起来后，由于卫生工作没有跟上去，病了一些人，生产受到了影响。党委抓了这一工作后，情况有了好转，使冬季生产任务提前完成了。由此可知，管好社员的集体卫生工作，是公社组织生产的重要一环，千万不可忽视。
