Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th (TASS dispatch): Mikoyan spent an hour and a half on the morning of the 14th visiting "Macy's," New York's largest department store.

    The company's Chairman, Straus, and managers Bingham and Mentjies of the New York department store greeted Mikoyan at the store's entrance and accompanied him on a tour of the various departments.

    Mikoyan toured all nine floors of the large store. He paid particular attention to synthetic materials and plastic products. In the furniture department, Mikoyan pointed out that some of the new furniture was light and comfortable. In the women's clothing department, he said that the new clothing exhibitions were well organized. The practice of letting buyers choose clothes without salespeople was also convenient. In the store's food department, Mikoyan was very interested in the varieties and packaging methods of cold foods.

    After visiting the department store, Mikoyan attended a banquet held in his honor by Shepard, chairman of "First National City Bank of New York," the largest bank in the United States. The banquet was held on the 50th floor of a skyscraper on Wall Street. Those attending the banquet included leading New York bankers and leaders of major industrial companies, including Helm, head of "Chemical Corn Exchange Bank," David Rockefeller, and John Rockefeller.

    Mikoyan then paid a visit to former New York Governor Harriman, who was the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union during World War II.

    After the meeting, Mikoyan answered questions from American and foreign reporters, saying: "We met like old friends and discussed many issues, including political and economic issues."

    Harriman told reporters that Mikoyan had invited him to visit Moscow. He said that he planned to go to the Soviet Union with his wife in May this year. When asked if he planned to meet with Khrushchev, Harriman said that he would be very happy to meet with Khrushchev if he had the opportunity.

    In the evening, Mikoyan attended a banquet held in his honor by the New York Economic Club at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and delivered a speech.
