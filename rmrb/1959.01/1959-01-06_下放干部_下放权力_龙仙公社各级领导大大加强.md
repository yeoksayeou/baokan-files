Transfer Cadres, Decentralize Power
Longxian Commune's Leadership at All Levels Greatly Strengthened

(Our report) The Longxian People's Commune in Wengjiang County, Guangdong Province (formerly the merged counties of Xinfeng and Wengyuan), recently, under the principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, transferred a group of cadres and a portion of power to the management districts and production teams, effectively increasing the initiative and enthusiasm of the cadres and initially overcoming the chaotic phenomena in production and financial management.

The Longxian Commune is a commune of over 10,000 households formed by merging fifteen agricultural cooperatives. As soon as the commune was established, it demonstrated its enormous power in various aspects of production. However, due to a lack of experience, the commune had the shortcomings of cadres and management power being overly concentrated. This, on the one hand, kept the commune's main leading cadres tied up in some routine matters, preventing them from concentrating their energy on considering and dealing with some major issues related to the entire commune. On the other hand, the cadres below waited for instructions from above and relied on the higher levels in everything.

In response to this situation, the commune's Party committee re-adjusted the organization during this rectification campaign, transferring a group of cadres and a portion of power to the management districts and production teams, achieving unified leadership and decentralized management. The commune transferred five Party committee secretaries and fifteen basic-level Party committee members to the management districts and production teams to serve as general branch secretaries, directors, branch secretaries, team leaders, and other positions. In the management of production organization, capital construction, financial expenditure, and welfare undertakings, the management districts and production teams were given certain powers. Labor is generally mobilized and arranged by the management districts and production teams. When the commune needs labor for large-scale capital construction related to the entire commune, it will draw labor from the production teams through the management districts. On the premise of ensuring the completion of the commune's planned tasks, each management district and production team can flexibly arrange and use labor according to their own characteristics. The commune will make unified regulations for the execution of financial expenditures for the whole commune, and the financial expenditures of each management district will be planned and submitted to the commune for approval, and each management district can flexibly control it within the scope of the plan. The surplus of sideline occupations and animal husbandry of each management district, in addition to completing the tasks assigned by the commune, will be rewarded with a percentage.

After the reorganization of the organizational management of the Longxian Commune, the leadership of the management districts and production teams has been strengthened, the cadres are more in-depth than in the past, and the chaotic phenomena of labor organization and finance have been initially overcome. Chen Yusheng, who was transferred from the commune to Nanpu Production Team as the Party branch secretary, immediately worked with the commune members and talked with them to listen to their opinions as soon as he arrived at the production team. Due to the strengthening of leadership and the decentralization of power, the spirit of being masters of their own affairs has been greatly brought into play by cadres at all levels, and many production teams have found their own ways to improve the welfare undertakings of their own units. Now, the entire commune has established various professional teams according to the current production situation, various tasks have begun to get on the right track, and the number of people attending work has increased from the original 9,000 to more than 12,000, and labor efficiency has also been significantly improved.

### 下放干部  下放权力  龙仙公社各级领导大大加强

    下放干部  下放权力
    龙仙公社各级领导大大加强
    本报讯　广东省翁江县（原新丰、翁源二县合并为翁江县）龙仙人民公社最近在统一领导、分级管理的原则下，下放一批干部和一部分权力到管理区和生产队，有效地提高了干部的主动性和积极性，初步克服了生产和财务管理的混乱现象。
    龙仙公社是由十五个农业社合并建成的一万多户的公社。公社一建立，就在各项生产上显示出它的巨大威力。但是，由于经验不足，公社存在有干部和管理权力过于集中的缺点。这样，一方面使公社主要领导干部缠在一些日常事务上，不能集中精力来考虑和处理一些有关全社性的重大问题。另一方面，下面的干部凡事等待上级布置，依赖上级。
    针对这种情况，公社党委在这次整社中重新调整了机构，下放了一批干部和一部分权力到管理区和生产队，做到统一领导、分级管理。公社下放五个党委书记、十五个基层党委委员到管理区和生产队任总支书、主任、支书、队长和其他职务。在组织生产、基本建设、财务开支、生活福利事业的管理上，都给管理区和生产队划出了一定权力。劳动力一般由管理区和生产队调动和安排使用。公社需要劳动力搞有关全社性的大型的基本建设时，要通过管理区向生产队抽调。各管理区和生产队在保证完成公社计划任务的基础上，可以根据自己的特点灵活安排使用劳动力。全社性财务开支由公社作出统一规定执行，管理区的财务开支各自作出计划上报公社批准执行，在计划的范围内各管理区可以灵活掌握。各管理区的副业、畜牧业等除完成公社分配任务外的多余部分，实行提成奖励。
    龙仙公社的组织管理经过整顿后，管理区和生产队的领导加强了，干部比过去深入了，劳动组织和财务混乱现象已初步克服。由公社下放南浦生产队担任党支部书记的陈育胜，一下到生产队就马上和社员一起劳动，和社员谈心，倾听他们的意见。由于领导加强和权力下放，大大发挥了各级干部当家作主的精神，许多生产队都自己想办法办好本单位的生活福利事业。现在，全社已根据当前的生产情况建立了各种专业队，各项工作已开始走上正轨，出勤人数由原来的九千多人增加到一万二千多人，劳动效率也有显著的提高。
