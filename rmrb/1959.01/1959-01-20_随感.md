Random Thoughts
José Martí:

José Martí (1853-1895) was a pioneer in the struggle for freedom and independence in Cuba and Latin America, and also a literary master. We are now re-excerpting and publishing his "Random Thoughts" to help readers understand the Cuban people's mood and will to resist colonial rule and demand independence. – Editor

Freedom comes at a high price, and people, unless they are willing to live a life of stealing freedom, must pay enough to fight for it.
                                ＊
The people, the suffering masses, are the true leaders of the revolution. This is what the autocrats do not understand.
                                ＊
What exchanges basic human rights is not tears but blood.
                                ＊
Good steel emits strong sparks after being hammered.
                                ＊
If the sun shines on a free land, nature is the most beautiful; if nature is covered by dark clouds and shadows, and the light of liberation cannot be seen, and people see their yokes like cattle and horses as soon as they open their eyes every morning, then there is no joy in the rural scenery, and fresh air cannot make people feel refreshed.
                                ＊
All the trees on the earth will eventually combine into one tree, and this tree will always spray fragrance; this is the tree of friendship, and its strong and lush branches will spread out a wide shade, allowing everyone to rest peacefully and happily under it.
                                ＊
The measure of the people in various eras is not the poor submission of one period after another, but their resistance at certain times.
                                ＊
Whoever is willing to try to attack heaven is qualified to ascend to heaven.
                                  ＊
It is better to be burned to death by the sun's flames than to live in the world like a corpse with folded arms.

    随感
    何塞·马蒂：
    何塞·马蒂（1853—1895）是古巴和拉丁美洲争取自由独立斗争的先驱者，也是一个文学大师。我们现在把他的“随感”重新摘录发表，是为了帮助读者了解古巴人民反抗殖民统治、要求独立的心情和意志。　——编者
    自由要花很高的代价，人们除非甘心不要自由而偷生，就得付出足够的代价去争取它。
                                ＊
    人民，愁苦的大众，才是革命的真正领导者。这是专制者不了解的。
                                ＊
    换取基本人权的不是眼泪而是鲜血。
                                ＊
    好钢铁经过锤打，就发出强烈的火花。
                                ＊
    如果阳光照耀着自由的国土，自然就是最美丽的；如果自然被乌云和阴翳蒙住，见不着解放的光芒，而人们每天早晨一睁开眼睛就看见自己的枷轭，像牛马一样，那么，乡村景物中就没有乐趣，新鲜空气也就不能叫人心旷神怡了。
                                ＊
    大地上所有的树终于要合成一棵树，这棵树要永远喷发清香；这是友爱的树，它的茁壮而繁茂的枝条要撑开广大的凉荫，让一切人都可以在它下面欢笑地和平地安息。
                                ＊
    衡量人民的各个时代的尺度不是一个时期又一个时期的贫乏的屈服，而是他们的某些时候的反抗。
                                ＊
    谁肯设法去猛攻天堂，谁就有资格登上天堂。
                                  ＊
    与其抱着膀子像一具死尸活在世上，不如让太阳的烈焰烧死。
