    Closely Integrate with Productive Labor;
    Study Book Knowledge Steadfastly;
    Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Strengthens Leadership over Teaching Work
    (Our Newspaper News) The Party organization of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, while comprehensively arranging teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, strengthens its leadership over teaching work and guides students to correctly understand the relationship between teaching and productive labor, and between theory and practice.

    For several months, the vast majority of students at this institute have insisted on classroom learning. At the same time, senior students have participated in the design and manufacture of cutting-edge products, while junior students have participated in construction, expansion of laboratories, manufacturing of experimental equipment, and tree planting and greening. Great achievements have been made in all three aspects of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. The departments of the school have basically arranged various tasks in accordance with the one-two-nine system (i.e., one month of vacation, two months of labor, and nine months of study). After further studying the issue of the three-way combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research in late December last year, the Party committee put forward opinions on strengthening the leadership of current teaching work. It requires firmly grasping the main link of teaching, closely integrating teaching with productive labor, and theory with practice, and must not neglect either. The Party committee also requested that the secretaries of Party and Youth League organizations at all levels of the school take the lead, regard teaching work as a major task, and conduct regular inspections and research. The Party committee and the Youth League committee also mobilized teachers to study issues such as comprehensive arrangements, strengthening the teaching of basic theoretical courses, and improving teaching methods.

    Currently, Party and Youth League general branches and class-level Party and Youth League branches in each department of the school have dedicated personnel to focus on learning, regularly study with representatives of each course, promptly reflect the problems and difficulties encountered by students in learning to the teaching and research group, and closely cooperate with teachers to carry out teaching work. Each class also made specific arrangements for the time of study, productive labor, rest, recreational and sports activities every week and every day, according to the overall requirements of the department, so that everyone can study well, work well, rest well, and have a good recreational life. At the same time, the Party and Youth League organizations of each department and class are very concerned about the ideological situation of the students. At one time, some students relaxed their theoretical study, and some did not grasp the link of reviewing lessons and preparing for exams tightly enough. They used the time of political activities to conduct discussions. The students first recalled the gains they had made since the spring of last year due to their participation in work-study programs, running factories in a big way, and steelmaking, which brought about tremendous changes in teaching and scientific research work. They then recognized the correct relationship between perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge, theory and practice, and education and productive labor, and that the two must be closely combined.

    After the discussions, many classes of students had a further understanding of the implementation of the Party's education policy. The students talked about how participating in the design and manufacture of the "Beijing No. 1" aircraft not only tempered their thinking but also deepened and consolidated their theoretical learning. Therefore, it is entirely possible to both work well and study well. The third-year students of the Seventh Department, after specific arrangements and collective study based on individual hard work, improved their learning efficiency. Now, the students are actively reviewing their lessons and preparing for the final exams. (Zhu Jigong)

    同生产劳动密切结合起来
    踏踏实实学习书本知识
    北京航空学院加强对教学工作的领导
    本报讯　北京航空学院党组织在统筹安排教学、生产劳动和科学研究的同时，加强对教学工作的领导，并引导学生正确地认识教学与生产劳动，理论与实践之间的关系。
    几个月以来，这个学院绝大多数学生一直坚持课堂学习，同时，高年级学生参加了尖端产品的设计制造工作，低年级学生参加了建厂、扩建实验室、制造实验设备以及植树绿化等劳动。在教学、生产劳动和科学研究三方面都获得了很大成绩。学校各系基本上按照一二九制
  （即一个月休假、二个月劳动、九个月学习）对各项工作进行了全面的安排。去年12月下旬，党委进一步研究了教学、生产劳动和科学研究工作三结合的问题以后，又提出了关于加强当前教学工作领导的意见。要求牢牢地抓住教学这一主要环节，把教学与生产劳动、理论与实践密切结合起来，决不可偏废。党委并要求学校各级党团组织书记挂帅，把教学工作作为一项主要任务，经常检查和研究。党委和团委也发动教师研究了全面安排、加强基础理论课教学、改进教学方法等问题。
    目前，这个学校各系党团总支和班级党团支部都有专人来抓学习，定期同各课课代表研究，及时地将同学在学习中发生的问题和困难反映到教研组，密切配合教师进行教学工作。各个班根据系里总的要求也对每周、每天的学习、生产劳动、休息、文娱体育活动的时间作了具体安排，使大家学习好、劳动好、休息好、文娱生活也过得好。同时，各系和班的党团组织很关心同学们的思想情况。曾有一度，部分学生对理论学习有点放松，某些人对温课迎接考试这一环节抓得也不够紧，他们就利用政治活动的时间进行座谈讨论。学生们首先回忆起去年春季以来，由于参加了勤工俭学、大办工厂、炼钢等运动所取得的收获，由此使教学和科学研究工作带来了巨大的变化，进而认识到感性知识与理性知识，理论与实践、教育与生产劳动之间的正确关系，两者必须密切结合起来。
    许多班学生在座谈后，对贯彻党的教育方针有了进一步的体会。学生们谈到参加“北京一号”飞机设计、制造过程中不仅锻炼了思想，对理论学习也更深刻巩固了。因此又劳动好、又学习好是完全能作得到的。第七系三年级学生经过具体安排，又在各人刻苦钻研的基础上进行集体学习后，使学习效率有了提高。现在，学生们正积极温课，迎接期终考试。　（朱继功）
