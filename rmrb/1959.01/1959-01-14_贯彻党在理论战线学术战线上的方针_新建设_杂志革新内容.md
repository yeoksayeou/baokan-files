Implement the Party's Guidelines on the Theoretical and Academic Fronts
"New Construction" Magazine Revamps its Content

The editorial board of "New Construction" magazine has decided that, starting this year, the magazine will be transformed into a comprehensive academic journal focusing on academic criticism and academic discussion. Its basic tasks are to promote Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, implement the Party's guidelines of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," integrating theory with practice, valuing the present over the past, use the spirit of revolutionary criticism on the academic front to criticize bourgeois academic thought, modern revisionist trends of thought, and dogmatism, and actively support mass academic criticism movements, cultivate and support new forces in the academic world, to establish and expand the Marxist theoretical ranks, and make philosophy and social sciences better serve socialist construction. According to the above new tasks, the content of the magazine's January issue has been significantly improved.

In this issue of the magazine, in order to implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and in conjunction with the actual situation of socialist construction in our country, articles by Comrades Liu Daosheng, Xue Muqiao, Xu Dixin, Wang Xuewen, and others were published. These articles explore and clarify issues such as building socialism and transitioning to communism, the characteristics of socialist production relations in our country, the nature of ownership in rural people's communes, commodity production under the current specific conditions in our country, and the unity of revolutionary and scientific character. Liu Daosheng's article, "New Topics for Social Science Workers Today," points out that social science workers in our country should continue to deeply criticize bourgeois academic thought, systematically study the theoretical issues of socialist construction and the transition to communism, and resolutely implement the mass line in scientific research work.

This issue of "New Construction" focuses on commenting on and reporting on the mass academic criticism movement that has emerged in various universities in Beijing since last summer. Comrade Pan Zinian, in a commentary entitled "Implement the Policy of Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend and Advance Academic Criticism Further," enthusiastically praised the achievements of the academic research and academic criticism movement in the past six months. He believes: "This movement is a major event in the academic world, a major event worthy of special mention." "This movement proves that academic research, like all other work, must engage in mass movements, follow the mass line, rely on collective strength, and combine experts and youth who are closely dependent on the leadership of the Party; it must oppose the expert line that is divorced from the leadership of the Party." "It is precisely because of these things that this movement can be energetic, high-spirited, and vigorous, and thus achieve great success." He pointed out that in order to make academic criticism deeper and more thorough in the future, it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend. For different opinions on various academic issues, full discussions and debates must be launched. For more complex issues that are not easy to draw conclusions on for a while, they should be discussed calmly and conclusions should not be drawn hastily. Even if conclusions are drawn, if there are still different opinions, discussions and debates can continue. "The more jade is polished, the more lustrous it becomes; the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes." Comrade Pan Zinian's article also pointed out the great significance of academic criticism for the ideological transformation of bourgeois intellectuals. He said: "As a bourgeois intellectual, if he does not undergo profound criticism and self-criticism in academic thought, it is impossible to completely abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish a proletarian, communist worldview."

In order to implement the Party's policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and to invigorate the atmosphere of free discussion in the academic world, so as to seek correct and unified views on some major theoretical issues of the moment, this issue of "New Construction" magazine also raised two questions for everyone to discuss. One is the question of "how to view the relationship between subjective initiative and objective economic laws"; the other is the view on the current economic crisis in the United States. The former was raised based on the arguments in an article written by De Lin published in the ninth issue of "Theoretical Front" published on December 10, 1958. The author of this article believes that objective laws can be eliminated, and the way to eliminate them is to eliminate the premise that produces this law. The author also believes that "circling around laws" is not feasible. We can and should use the power of the superstructure to promote economic development, and we should create conditions to eliminate those "laws" that hinder people from rapidly transitioning to communism. In the discussion of the latter question, Wu Dakun's counter-criticism article was published. Wu Dakun believes that the criticism by several comrades from the American Economic Crisis Research Group of the Economics Department of Renmin University of China that his views on the American economic crisis have revisionist viewpoints is untenable and dogmatic. The editors pointed out in the editor's note that this is a question related to the basic economic principles of Marxism and the views on the current international situation, and further discussion is necessary.

### 贯彻党在理论战线学术战线上的方针  “新建设”杂志革新内容

    贯彻党在理论战线学术战线上的方针
    “新建设”杂志革新内容
    “新建设”杂志编委会决定从今年开始，这个杂志改为以学术批判和学术讨论为主的综合性学术刊物。它的基本任务是宣传马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，贯彻党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、理论联系实际、厚今薄古的方针，在学术战线上用革命的批判的精神，对资产阶级学术思想、现代修正主义思潮以及教条主义进行批判，并积极支持群众性的学术批判运动，培养和扶植学术界的新生力量，以建立和扩大马克思主义的理论队伍，使哲学、社会科学更好地为社会主义建设服务。该刊一月号根据以上新的任务，在内容上有了比较显著的改进。
    在这一期杂志上，为了贯彻党的八届六中全会决议，结合我国当前的社会主义建设的实际，发表了刘导生、薛暮桥、许涤新、王学文等同志的文章。这些文章就建设社会主义和向共产主义过渡、我国社会主义生产关系的特点、农村人民公社所有制的性质、我国目前具体条件下的商品生产以及革命性和科学性的统一等问题，作了探讨和阐明。刘导生的“社会科学工作者当前的新课题”一文，指出我国社会科学工作者当前应当继续深入地批判资产阶级学术思想，系统地研究社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡的理论问题，并在科学研究工作中坚决贯彻群众路线。
    这一期的“新建设”上，着重地对去年夏季以来在北京各高等学校里出现的群众性的学术批判运动，进行了评论和报道。潘梓年同志在题为“贯彻百家争鸣的方针，把学术批判再推向前进”的评论文章中，热情地赞扬了半年来的学术研究和学术批判运动的成就。他认为：“这次运动是学术界的一件大事，是值得大书特书的一件大事。”“这次运动证明，学术研究，也和其他一切工作一样要搞群众运动，要走群众路线，要依靠集体力量，要有紧紧依靠着党的领导的专家和青年相结合；要反对脱离党的领导的专家路线。”“正是由于有了这一些，这次运动才能精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发，因而获得了巨大的成就。”他指出：今后要把学术批判搞得更深更透，必须继续贯彻党的百家争鸣的方针。对于各种学术问题上的不同意见，必须展开充分的讨论和争论，对于比较复杂的一时不易作出结论的问题，更应该从容商讨，不要匆忙作出结论。即使作出了结论，如果还有不同的意见，还可以继续讨论和争辩。“玉石愈攻愈晶莹，真理愈辩愈明彻。”潘梓年同志的文章，还指出了学术批判对于资产阶级知识分子的思想改造的重大意义。他说：“作为一个资产阶级知识分子，如果在学术思想上，不经过深刻的批判和自我批判，也就不可能彻底抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。”
    为了贯彻党的百家争鸣的方针，活跃学术界的自由讨论的空气，以便对当前一些重大的理论问题求得正确的一致的看法，这一期的“新建设”杂志上，还提出了两个问题，让大家展开讨论。一个是“如何看待主观能动作用和客观经济规律的关系”问题；一个是关于当前美国经济危机的看法问题。前者是根据1958年12月10日出版的第九期“理论战线”上刊登的德麟写的一篇文章的论点提出的。这篇文章的作者认为：客观规律是可以消灭的，消灭的办法就是消灭产生这个规律的前提。作者并认为：“绕着规律打圈子”是不行的。我们可以而且应该运用上层建筑的力量，推动经济的发展，对于那些妨碍人们迅速地过渡到共产主义的“规律”，应当创造条件，使它们归于消灭。在后一个问题的讨论中，发表了吴大琨的反批判的文章。吴大琨认为，中国人民大学经济系美国经济危机研究小组几位同志批评他对美国经济危机的看法上有修正主义观点的说法，是不能成立的，是教条主义。编者在按语里指出，这是关系到马克思主义基本经济原理的问题和当前国际形势的看法问题，有进一步讨论的必要。
