　　On the eve of the New Year, the Albanian government trade delegation, headed by Albanian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Abdyl Kellezi, came from the Adriatic coast to our country for a friendly visit and was warmly welcomed by our government and people. During the visit, the Albanian government trade delegation held talks with our government on Sino-Albanian economic cooperation and trade development, and achieved satisfactory results. Yesterday, both sides signed the Sino-Albanian governments' long-term trade agreement for 1961 to 1965 and the agreement on the People's Republic of China granting loans to the People's Republic of Albania in Beijing. We are excited to see that our two countries' economic cooperation and friendly unity have been further developed and consolidated, which is something to be celebrated!
　　Although China and Albania are thousands of miles apart, our two peoples have long enjoyed close friendship. The Chinese people greatly admire the heroic spirit shown by the Albanian people in the war against fascist aggression; the Albanian people have always sympathized with the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. After our two peoples successively achieved revolutionary victories, we established a new type of fraternal relationship on the common ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism, and formed an eternal and unbreakable friendship. Today, we are all close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, our two countries have supported each other politically and helped and cooperated with each other in economic and cultural affairs. Mutual visits by party and government leaders, people's representatives, and delegations in economic and cultural fields between our two countries have strengthened the exchange of construction experiences and enhanced the understanding between our two peoples. Our two countries' friendly unity is growing with the years and becoming increasingly consolidated.
　　In recent years, Sino-Albanian economic relations have been developing rapidly, and the trade volume between the two countries has been increasing continuously, increasing by 16% in 1958 compared with 1957. In this meeting, the Chinese government provided Albania with a loan of 55 million rubles, which Albania will use to purchase equipment for cotton textile mills, packaging linen mills, and glass factories, as well as other machinery and equipment and goods from our country. At the same time, according to the long-term trade agreement for 1961 to 1965 signed by both parties, our country will provide Albania with materials such as vegetable oil, rice, rubber, tires, and steel; Albania will also supply our country with materials such as crude oil, gasoline, blister copper, and chromite ore. The signing of these two agreements is conducive to the arrangement and coordination of our two countries' long-term plans for developing the national economy, and fully embodies the lofty spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation within the socialist family to promote the common upsurge of the socialist economy.
　　The Chinese people have always been concerned about the socialist construction of the Albanian people, and are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the Albanian people in their construction. In the past thirteen years, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the government, have made brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Albania's industry has developed at an unprecedented speed. In 1958, Albania's total industrial output value increased by 20% compared with 1957, and more than sixteen times compared with the pre-war 1938. At present, calculated per capita, Albania's output of oil, coal, copper, and chromium ore has exceeded that of capitalist countries such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey. Albania's agriculture has also made great progress. The cultivated area of agricultural producers' cooperatives has accounted for 76.2% of the country's cultivated area, and the number of farmers participating in cooperatives has accounted for 62.6% of the country's farmers. Albania's cultural and educational undertakings are also constantly developing, and the people's living standards are constantly improving. At present, the Albanian people are striving to realize the second five-year plan for developing the national economy from 1956 to 1960 ahead of schedule. The Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Albanian brothers on their ever-changing achievements in socialist construction.
　　The Chinese people have always admired the outstanding contributions made by the Albanian people in defending world peace and the socialist cause. Whether on the rostrum of the United Nations, or in other international organizations and peace organizations, we can hear the voices of peace of the heroic Albanian people. The Albanian people are united with the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, and stand on the western frontier of the socialist camp, waging a resolute struggle to defend the security of the socialist camp, oppose imperialist aggression, defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and oppose modern revisionism.
　　The Albanian people have always strongly supported our socialist construction, and firmly supported the just struggle of our people to liberate our territory Taiwan and coastal islands. Our people are very grateful for this! As the Albanian guests, headed by Deputy Chairman A. Kellezi, are making a friendly visit to our country and the Sino-Albanian government talks are successfully concluded, we sincerely wish that Sino-Albanian economic cooperation will be continuously strengthened, and that the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples will last forever!

    中阿经济合作的新成就
    新年前夕，以阿尔巴尼亚部长会议副主席阿卜杜勒·凯列齐为首的阿尔巴尼亚政府贸易代表团，从亚得里亚海滨远道前来我国进行友好访问，受到我国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。在访问期间，阿尔巴尼亚政府贸易代表团同我国政府，就中阿两国经济合作和发展贸易问题举行了会谈，并且获得了圆满的结果。昨日双方在北京签订了中阿两国政府关于1961年到1965年长期贸易协定和关于中华人民共和国给予阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国贷款的协定。我们兴奋地看到我们两国的经济合作和友好团结进一步发展和巩固，这是非常值得庆贺的事情！
    中国和阿尔巴尼亚虽然相隔万里，然而我们两国人民之间早已有了亲密的友谊。中国人民十分钦佩阿尔巴尼亚人民在反抗法西斯侵略战争中所表现的英雄气概；阿尔巴尼亚人民也一向同情中国人民的革命斗争。在我们两国人民相继取得革命胜利以后，在马克思列宁主义的共同思想基础上，我们两国之间建立了新型的兄弟关系，结成了永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。今天，我们都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的亲密兄弟。几年来，我们两国在政治上相互支持，在经济上和文化上彼此互助合作。我们两国的党政领导人、人民代表以及经济和文化等方面的代表团的互相访问，加强了两国建设经验的交流，增进了两国人民之间的了解。我们两国的友好团结正随着岁月的增长而不断发展，日益巩固。
    近年来，中阿两国经济关系日益发展，两国贸易额不断增长，1958年又比1957年增长16％。在这次会谈中，我国政府又向阿尔巴尼亚提供五千五百万卢布的贷款，阿尔巴尼亚将用此贷款向我国购买棉纺织厂、包装麻布厂和玻璃厂的设备以及其他机器设备和货物。同时，根据双方签订的1961年到1965年长期贸易协定，我国将向阿尔巴尼亚提供植物油、大米、橡胶、轮胎和钢材等物资；阿尔巴尼亚也将供给我国以原油、汽油、紫铜和铬矿石等物资。这两个协定的签订，有利于我们两国发展国民经济长期计划的安排和配合，并且充分体现了社会主义大家庭中互相帮助，彼此合作，以促进社会主义经济共同高涨的崇高精神。
    中国人民一向关怀阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义建设，并且为阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设中所获得的巨大成就而欢欣鼓舞。在过去十三年中，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。阿尔巴尼亚的工业以空前的速度向前发展。1958年阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值比1957年增长了20％，比战前1938年则增长了十六倍以上。目前按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚的石油、煤、铜和铬矿的产量已超过希腊、意大利和土耳其等资本主义国家。阿尔巴尼亚的农业也有了很大的发展。农业生产合作社的耕地面积已占全国耕地面积的76.2％，参加合作社的农户已占全国农户的62.6％。阿尔巴尼亚的文化和教育事业也在不断发展，人民生活水平也在不断提高。目前，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在为提前实现1956—1960年发展国民经济的第二个五年计划而奋斗。中国人民衷心祝贺阿尔巴尼亚兄弟们在社会主义建设中取得日新月异的成就。
    中国人民也一向敬佩阿尔巴尼亚人民在保卫世界和平和社会主义事业中所作的卓越贡献。无论在联合国的讲坛上，或是在其他国际组织与和平组织中，我们都可以听到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的和平呼声。阿尔巴尼亚人民同以苏联为首的兄弟国家人民团结在一起，并且站在社会主义阵营的西部前哨，为保卫社会主义阵营的安全、反对帝国主义的侵略，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、反对现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民一向对我国的社会主义建设大力帮助，并且坚决支持我国人民解放我国领土台湾和沿海岛屿的正义斗争。我国人民对此十分感激！当以阿·凯列齐副主席为首的阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们在我国进行友好访问和中阿两国政府会谈圆满结束的时候，我们衷心地祝中阿两国经济合作不断加强，祝中阿两国人民的兄弟友谊万古长青！
