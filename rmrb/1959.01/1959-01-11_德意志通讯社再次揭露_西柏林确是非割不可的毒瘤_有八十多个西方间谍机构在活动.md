Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: The German News Agency reports that the West Berlin city government has instructed the Senator responsible for internal affairs, the Social Democrat Lipshitz, to draft a "memorandum" to prove that West Berlin is not a center for espionage against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. In response, the German News Agency has published factual material proving the despicable role that West Berlin plays in the plans of West Germany and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The German News Agency said that currently, more than eighty Western intelligence agencies or their branches are engaged in criminal activities in West Berlin. In the past year alone, the West Berlin city government allocated 1.2 million marks from its budget to the above-mentioned organizations for espionage activities. West Berlin Mayor Brandt said during his visit to the United States last year that West Berlin would take all necessary actions to "disrupt as much as possible" the stability of the German Democratic Republic's state power. At about the same time, West Berlin's "Spandauer Volksblatt" also wrote that spy organizations and recruitment stations for intelligence agencies, such as "Organizations Against Inhumanity," are increasingly becoming "institutions enjoying state privileges."

The German News Agency also recalled the materials revealed by Stockholm's "Aftonbladet" months ago about West Berlin being a center for espionage and provocation. The "Aftonbladet" said that Western intelligence agencies are extremely careful in recruiting spies from among former citizens of the German Democratic Republic. The "Aftonbladet" quoted a West Berlin spy chief named Bahr as saying that the purpose of the spy organization's activities is to prepare for war against the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and the Soviet Union. Finally, the German News Agency listed the names of many of the most important secret organizations and intelligence agencies in West Berlin that operate in accordance with the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    德意志通讯社再次揭露
    西柏林确是非割不可的毒瘤
    有八十多个西方间谍机构在活动
    新华社10日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，西柏林市政府责成负责内部问题的参议员、社会民主党人利普希次拟订一份“备忘录”，来证明西柏林不是从事反对德意志民主共和国和其它社会主义国家的间谍中心。德意志通讯社就此发表事实材料，证明西柏林在西德和北大西洋公约组织其他国家的计划中所扮演的卑鄙角色。
    德意志通讯社说，目前西柏林有八十多个西方谍报机构或它们的分支机构从事罪恶活动。仅在去年一年，西柏林市政府就从它的预算中拨出一百二十万马克给上述组织来进行特务活动。西柏林市长勃兰特在去年访问美国时就说：西柏林将采取一切必要的行动，来“尽可能地破坏”民主德国国家政权的稳定。差不多在同一个时候，西柏林的“斯班都人民报”也写道，像“反对非人道组织”之类的特务组织和谍报机构的招募站，日益成为“享受国家特权的机构”。
    德意志通讯社还追述数月前斯德哥尔摩“晚报”揭露西柏林是谍报和挑衅中心的材料。这家“晚报”说，西方谍报机构极其注意在民主德国从前的公民中间搜罗特务。“晚报”援引西柏林的一个特务头子贝尔的话说，特务组织活动的目的在于准备对民主德国、波兰和苏联发动战争。德意志通讯社最后列举了许多在西柏林的、遵照北大西洋公约组织的主张进行活动的、最重要的秘密组织和谍报机构的名称。
