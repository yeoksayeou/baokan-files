    Construction Workers with High Mobility Can Also Study Regularly
    Shaanxi Third Construction Engineering Company Properly Arranges Time to Persist in Spare-Time Education
    (Our report) The Shaanxi Third Construction Engineering Company has properly arranged the spare time of its employees and has persisted in carrying out spare-time education for more than two years, which has improved the cultural level of the employees and promoted production.
    The Third Construction Engineering Company has more than 5,000 employees, scattered in ten work areas (teams or factories); these work areas are spread all over the suburbs of Xi'an, far apart from each other; each work area is divided into several work sections and construction sites. When the company began to run spare-time education for employees in October 1956, some people thought that construction sites were scattered and workers often moved around, so schools could not be run. However, the workers said that each construction site had at least one or two hundred people, and schools could be run. According to the opinions of the workers, the company's Party committee handed over the schools to the work sections to run. Each work section formed different classes from literacy to middle school according to the cultural level and number of workers. In this way, all employees could participate in learning.
    Workers at construction sites often gather and disperse unpredictably. After the house is built, the workers move to another place, and learning is often interrupted; some workers, after moving to other construction sites, although they attend classes, the learning progress and courses are often different from the original; new construction sites, the workers are always busy building work sheds, arranging accommodation, preparing for construction, etc., and cannot immediately attend classes. Therefore, in the early stage of running schools in work sections, the study of employees was not very regular, and the attendance rate in some construction sites was only 60%. After repeated study of these situations, the company's Party committee stipulated that in newly opened construction sites, as long as the workers arrive, even if construction has not started, classes should be started immediately, and six hours of study per week should be guaranteed; employees who are transferred to work should transfer their learning relationships; at the same time, the learning progress and course arrangements of each work section should be the same. Since there were more workers in primary school in the work section, two classes with different progress were set up, and workers who were transferred to work could insert into appropriate classes to continue learning.
    The Third Construction Engineering Company reasonably arranges time according to the characteristics of the construction industry to ensure the learning of employees. At one time, some spare-time activities often occupied study time, and the study of employees was greatly affected. The workers in the Second Work Area implemented the method of studying for one hour every morning before going to work, which guaranteed six hours of study per week. This method was promoted throughout the company, and the attendance rate in class rose to more than 90%. In the past, the spare time of employees in the evening was almost completely occupied by various activities. Later, these activities were combined with the courses of study for employees, and activities related to production technology such as safety education, planning briefing, professional training, and "all-rounder" education were placed in technical classes; current affairs education and political study were combined with political classes; Party, League, and trade union activities were changed to be carried out on the same evening; cultural classes were combined with central work. After the teachers finished teaching cultural classes, they mobilized the workers to carry out activities such as "not returning empty-handed after work" and "picking up waste materials", reducing the number of meetings. In this way, at least sixteen evenings of spare time can be freed up every month, and there is more than enough time for learning. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, each work area has established a special committee, which uniformly arranges production, study and other activities every half month, overcoming the phenomenon of multi-headed leadership and mutual competition for spare time.
    Now, this company has completely eliminated illiteracy; the proportion of those with a cultural level equivalent to that of senior primary school has increased from 28% of the total number of employees to 63%; those with a cultural level of junior middle school or above account for 35%. In the past two years, 236 cadres have been promoted from among the workers.
    After the cultural level of the employees was improved, it greatly promoted production. After learning mechanics, Cao Huiji, a national advanced producer, used a pulley block on the cold-drawn steel bar machine, which increased the ordinary steel bar machine that could only draw 14 mm to be able to draw 40 mm threaded steel; he used a three-and-a-half-ton winch to solve the problem of lifting weight of more than 40 tons, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient equipment and saving a lot of steel. After many workers improved their culture, they improved their tools, making manual operation mechanized or semi-mechanized. Many workers have learned to read blueprints and improved production efficiency.

### 流动大的建筑工人也能常年学习  陕西第三建筑工程公司妥善安排时间坚持业余教育

    流动大的建筑工人也能常年学习
    陕西第三建筑工程公司妥善安排时间坚持业余教育
    本报讯　陕西省第三建筑工程公司妥善地安排职工业余时间，两年多以来，一直坚持进行业余教育，提高了职工的文化水平，推动了生产。
    第三建筑工程公司有五千多名职工，分散在十个工区（队或工厂）；这些工区遍布西安市郊，相距很远；每个工区又分若干工段和工地。1956年10月，这个公司开始举办职工业余教育的时候，有些人认为建筑工地分散，工人经常流动，不能办学校。但是工人们说，每个工地至少也有一、二百人，可以办学校。公司党委根据工人们的意见，把学校交给工段去办。各工段按照工人文化程度和人数多少编成由扫盲到中学的不同班级。这样，全部职工都能参加学习了。
    建筑工地的工人常常聚散不定，房子盖完，工人便迁到另外一个地方，学习常常中断；有些工人迁到别的工地以后，虽然跟班上课了，但是学习进度和课程往往同原来不一样；新开辟的工地，工人们总是先忙着搭工棚、安排食宿、准备开工等等，不能立刻上课。因此工段办学初期，职工学习很不经常，有的工地上课出席率只有60％。公司党委反复研究这些情况后，规定新开辟的工地，只要工人一到，没有开工，也要马上开学，每星期保证六小时学习；调动工作的职工要转学习关系；同时把各工段的学习进度和课程安排成一样，工段上小学的工人比较多，便设立两个不同进度的班次，调动工作的工人可以插入适当班级继续学习。
    第三建筑工程公司根据建筑业的特点，合理安排时间，保证职工的学习。有一个时期，一些业余活动常常占用学习时间，职工学习受很大影响。二工区工人实行了每天早晨上班前学习一小时的办法，保证了每周六小时的学习。全公司推行了这个办法，上课出席率上升到90％以上。过去职工们晚上的业余时间几乎都被各种活动占完了。以后，把这些活动和职工学习的课程结合起来，把安全教育、计划交底、专业训练、“多面手”教育等有关生产技术方面的活动放在技术课进行；时事教育和政治学习同政治课结合起来；党、团、工会活动改在同一天晚上进行；文化课结合中心工作，教师上完文化课，便动员工人开展“下工不空手”“拾废料”活动，减少了会议次数。这样，每月至少可以腾出十六个晚上的业余时间，学习时间也就绰绰有余了。同时各工区在党委统一领导下，都成立了专门委员会，每半月统一安排一次生产、学习和其他活动，克服了多头领导和业余时间互争互挤的现象。
    现在，这个公司已经完全扫除了文盲；相当高小文化水平的由占职工总数的28％提高到63％；初中文化程度以上的占35％。两年来从工人中提拔了二百三十六名干部。
    职工文化水平提高后，大大推动了生产。全国先进生产者曹会吉学了力学后，在冷拉钢筋机上使用了滑轮组，把原来只能拉十四米厘的普通钢筋机器，提高到能拉四十米厘的螺纹钢；他用三吨半的卷扬机，解决了四十多吨起重量的问题，克服了设备不足的困难，节约了大量钢材。不少工人提高文化以后，改进了工具，使手工操作变为机械化或半机械化。许多工人学会看图纸，提高了生产效率。
