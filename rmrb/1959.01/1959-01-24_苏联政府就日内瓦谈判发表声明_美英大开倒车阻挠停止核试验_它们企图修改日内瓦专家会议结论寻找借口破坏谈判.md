Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - TASS reports: The Soviet government has issued a statement regarding the negotiations in Geneva between the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. The statement said that the negotiations, which have lasted for more than two and a half months, have attracted the attention of people around the world.

The statement said that the Soviet government has always believed, and still believes, that as long as all countries possessing nuclear weapons are willing, the issue of stopping nuclear testing can be resolved now, without having to wait for the resolution of other disarmament issues.

The statement continued, however, that this pressing issue has not yet been resolved due to the position taken by Western countries. The US and British governments, in order to conceal their unwillingness to stop nuclear testing, have fabricated a set of arguments, saying that it is impossible to establish effective supervision of countries fulfilling the agreement to stop nuclear testing. However, the eight-nation experts' meeting held in Geneva in July and August 1958 unanimously concluded that using existing methods of detecting nuclear explosions, coupled with on-site inspections of suspicious and unclear phenomena, it would be possible to detect and identify nuclear explosions conducted anywhere, including underground explosions.

The statement said that the conclusions and recommendations in the Geneva experts' meeting report have been endorsed by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. However, the position taken by the US and British governments at the current Geneva conference shows that these countries are still hindering the successful drafting of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests. Furthermore, although some positive results have recently been achieved in negotiating certain provisions of the future agreement due to the Soviet Union's initiative, Western countries have repeatedly obstructed mutually acceptable agreements in every possible way, actually threatening the conference with collapse.

The statement emphasized that this is particularly evident in the US government's statement issued on January 6 of this year regarding the issue of detecting underground nuclear explosions. In the statement, the US government stubbornly claimed that, according to new materials obtained from the results of underground nuclear explosions conducted by the United States last October, identifying underground nuclear explosions is more difficult than previously thought. The US and British representatives in Geneva immediately stated directly that the current conference should study seismic materials in order to draft an agreement based on new conclusions (different from the conclusions in the Geneva experts' meeting report) in the future.

The Soviet government statement said that, clearly, the US and British governments are attempting to portray the situation as if the monitoring system formulated by the Geneva experts' meeting, in which US scientists participated, is not in accordance with the meeting's conclusions and is not effective enough. They are attempting to use this to argue that the conclusions and recommendations made by the experts in 1958 must be revised, thereby preparing the conditions for their rejection of an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

The statement pointed out that the purpose of the United States and Britain in attempting to revise the recommendations and conclusions of the Geneva experts' meeting is to shift the work of the current tripartite conference from formulating an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests back to discussing already resolved technical issues. Everyone can clearly see that following the path that the US and British governments are pushing the tripartite conference onto means returning to the original starting point, means a major backslide, and in fact means obliterating the results of the Geneva experts' meeting. From all this, it is reasonable to conclude that the United States and Britain are unwilling to end nuclear weapon testing, and they continue to evade resolving the main issues in signing a treaty on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. They only occasionally put forward some individual clauses of the agreement for discussion, but avoid the main issues of the agreement, constantly creating new difficulties in the path of drafting mutually acceptable agreements.

The statement said that the work of the Geneva conference is now at such a stage that the issue of the validity period of the agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests is of paramount importance, because failure to make a decision on this issue will not only become a serious obstacle to preparing the above-mentioned agreement, but will also render the negotiations themselves meaningless. It is worth noting that the US and British governments should have expressed their opinions on the validity period of the agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, but they are again attempting to go back and discuss the principles of supervision that have already been agreed upon at the Geneva experts' meeting. After the US government's statement was issued, more calls came for suspending the work of drafting an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. Some American newspapers even brazenly and openly demanded that the Geneva negotiations be stopped and that the United States resume nuclear testing. This is not accidental.

The statement said that, of course, the Soviet government takes into account that, as time goes on, new scientific materials related to detecting nuclear explosions will emerge, because science is constantly developing. However, if conclusions have already been made on the possibility of discovering nuclear explosions and ensuring the effectiveness of supervision based on known materials, then future additions to these materials and improvements in detection methods will make such supervision more effective. The new detection materials and improvements in detection methods will not only not weaken the conclusions of the Geneva experts' meeting, but will further strengthen these conclusions.

The statement emphasized that the US government's above-mentioned statement and the attitude of the US and British representatives at the Geneva conference confirm the Soviet government's concern that these countries are unwilling to reach an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and apparently, they are looking for excuses to disrupt the work of the ongoing Geneva conference.

The statement concluded by saying that, as for the Soviet government, it will continue to do everything possible to ensure that the issue of a permanent cessation of nuclear testing is resolved as quickly as possible. The solution to this issue now, as before, depends on the US and British governments, and only on these two governments.

### 苏联政府就日内瓦谈判发表声明  美英大开倒车阻挠停止核试验  它们企图修改日内瓦专家会议结论寻找借口破坏谈判

    苏联政府就日内瓦谈判发表声明
    美英大开倒车阻挠停止核试验
    它们企图修改日内瓦专家会议结论寻找借口破坏谈判
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：苏联政府就在日内瓦举行的苏联、美国和英国三国政府关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的谈判发表了声明。声明说，苏联、美国和英国三国政府就停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题在日内瓦进行了两个半月多的谈判，这个谈判吸引了全世界人民的注意。
    声明说，苏联政府过去和现在一向认为，只要一切拥有核武器的国家愿意，停止核试验问题现在就可以解决，而不必等待其他裁军问题的解决。
    声明接着说，但是，由于西方国家所采取的立场，这个迫切的问题至今仍未能解决。美英政府为了掩饰它们不愿意停止核试验的行径，编造了一套论据，说什么建立对各国履行停止核试验的协定的有效的监督是不可能的。然而，1958年7月至8月在日内瓦举行的八国专家会议一致得出结论，认为使用现有的侦察核爆炸的方法，加上对有核爆炸嫌疑的、情况不明的现象进行实地视察，就有可能侦知和辨别任何地方进行的核爆炸，其中包括地下爆炸。
    声明说，日内瓦专家会议报告中的结论和建议已经得到苏联、美国和英国政府的赞同。但是，美国和英国政府在目前日内瓦会议上采取的立场表明，这些国家仍然在阻碍成功地进行草拟停止核武器试验协定的工作。此外，虽然最近由于苏联的主动，在协商未来的协定的某些条款方面取得了某些积极的结果，但是西方国家接二连三地百般阻挠互相可以接受的协定，实际上使得会议面临破裂的威胁。
    声明强调说，这一点，特别在美国政府今年1月6日发表的关于侦察地下核爆炸问题的声明中可以看出。美国政府在声明中硬说，根据美国在去年10月进行地下核爆炸的结果所获得的新的材料证明，识别地下核爆炸比到目前为止所认为的要困难。美国和英国在日内瓦的代表后来马上就直接声明说，现在正在举行的会议应该研究地震材料，以便今后根据新的结论（不同于日内瓦专家会议报告中的结论）草拟协定。
    苏联政府声明说，可见，美国和英国政府企图把事情说成是：有美国科学家参加的日内瓦专家会议所制定的监督系统，与会议结论并不符合，它是不够有效的。它们企图这样来论证必须修改专家们在1958年所得出的结论和建议，从而为它们拒绝关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协定准备条件。
    声明指出，美国和英国企图修改日内瓦专家会议的建议和结论的目的是，想把当前三国会议的工作从制定关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协定再次转到讨论已经解决了的技术问题上去。每一个人都可以清楚看出，走美国和英国政府把三国会议推上的那条道路，就意味着回到原来的出发点，意味着大大的倒退，事实上就是抹杀日内瓦专家会议的结果。从这一切看来，有根据得出结论，那就是美国和英国不愿意结束核武器试验，它们仍然逃避解决在签订停止原子武器和氢武器试验条约方面的主要问题。它们只是有时把协定的一些个别条文提出讨论，但避免协定的主要问题，不断在草拟互相可以接受的协定的道路上制造新的困难。
    声明说，现在日内瓦会议的工作已经处在这样一个阶段，即关于停止核武器试验协定的有效期限问题有着头等意义，因为不就这个问题作出决定，不仅会成为准备上述协定道路上的严重障碍，而且会使谈判本身失去意义。值得注意的是：美国和英国政府本来现在应该就停止试验核武器协定的有效期限表示意见，可是它们重新企图回过头去讨论已经在日内瓦专家会议上达成协议的监督原则。美国政府的声明发表后，更多地传来了要中止草拟停止原子武器和氢武器试验协定的工作的叫嚣。某些美国报纸竟毫不客气地公然要求停止日内瓦谈判，要求美国恢复核试验。这不是偶然的。
    声明说，当然，苏联政府考虑到，随着时间的前进，将会出现同侦察核爆炸有关的新的科学材料，因为科学是在不断发展的。但是，如果根据已知的材料已经作出了关于可能发现核爆炸和保证监督有效性的结论，那末在这方面今后增添的材料和侦察手段的改进将会使得这种监督更为有效。侦察的新材料和侦察手段的改进不仅不会削弱日内瓦专家会议的结论，反而会更加强这些结论。
    声明强调说，美国政府上述声明和美国、英国代表在日内瓦会议的态度证实了苏联政府的担心，即：这些国家不愿意就停止原子武器和氢武器试验达成协议，显然，它们在寻找借口来破坏正在进行的日内瓦会议的工作。
    声明最后说，至于苏联政府，它仍然将尽一切力量使永远停止核试验的问题尽可能快地得到解决。现在这个问题的解决，像以前一样，取决于美国和英国政府，而且只取决于这两国政府。
