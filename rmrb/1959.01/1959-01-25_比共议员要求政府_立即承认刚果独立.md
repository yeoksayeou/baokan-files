Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, January 24th: Gaston Moulin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party and member of the Belgian Parliament, said at the parliamentary discussion on the Congo issue on the 13th: "The only correct solution understood by the Belgian people is to recognize the independence of the Congo."

Moulin's speech was recently published in the Belgian Communist Party's organ, "The Red Flag."

In his speech, Moulin exposed the deceptive nature of the government's so-called declaration of preparing to grant independence to the Congo. He pointed out that the Belgian government's statement "does not affirm the Congolese people's right to unquestionable independence." Concurrent with the issuance of this statement, the measures taken by the Belgian colonial authorities in the Congo were: "Strengthening police rule, dispatching reinforcements from the Belgian mainland, arresting new Congolese elected district chiefs, and ordering the dissolution of the 'Abako' organization."

Moulin accused the government of still insisting that the Congo "does not yet have qualified negotiating partners and needs to cultivate them," attempting to delay the granting of independence to the Congo while being forced to make a show of concessions under the pressure of the situation today. Moulin said: "Currently, there are various organizations, leaders, elected representatives, some leaders, intellectuals, and workers in the Congo who collectively constitute an object with whom people can and must negotiate. ... The Congo is no longer something you can manipulate at will and act according to your own will."

Moulin pointed out that the correct way to solve the Congo issue is to immediately realize the independence and freedom of the Congo. He expressed his hope that the independence of the Congo can be realized in the process of peaceful cooperation between Belgians and Congolese, and demanded: immediately withdraw Belgian troops, release the arrested, allow the activities of various Congolese organizations, expand the electoral system, and guarantee trade union rights.

Moulin called on the national democratic forces to unite to demand that the government pursue a policy that leads to the independence of the Congo.

    比共议员要求政府
    立即承认刚果独立
    新华社24日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党中央委员会政治局委员、比利时议会议员加斯东·穆兰在13日议会讨论刚果问题的会议上说：“比利时人民所了解的唯一正确解决办法，就是承认刚果独立。”
    穆兰的发言不久以前刊登在比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”上。
    穆兰在发言中揭露了政府所谓准备给刚果独立的声明的欺骗性。他指出，比利时政府的声明“不肯定刚果人民享有不可怀疑的独立权利”。在发表这个声明的同时，在刚果的比利时殖民当局采取的措施是：“加强警察统治，从比利时本土增派援军，逮捕新的刚果民选区长，下令解散‘阿巴科’组织”。
    穆兰指责政府今天在局势的压力之下被迫作出装样子的让步的时候，还硬说什么刚果“还没有有资格的谈判对象，需要予以培养”，企图拖延时日而不给刚果独立。穆兰说：“目前在刚果有各种组织、领导人、民选的代表、一些领袖、知识分子和劳动者，他们集体地构成一个人们可以而且必须同他们进行谈判的对象。……刚果再也不是你们可以随意摆布的了，而且按照自己的意志行事的。”
    穆兰指出，正确解决刚果问题的道路，是立即实现刚果的独立和自由。他表示希望刚果的独立能在比利时人和刚果人和平合作的过程中实现，并且要求：立即把比利时军队撤走，释放被捕者，允许刚果的各种组织活动，扩大选举制度，保障工会权利。
    穆兰号召全国民主力量团结起来，来要求政府奉行使刚果独立的政策。
