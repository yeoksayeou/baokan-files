New Folk Songs
	The secretary takes the lead, the soldiers follow the general's orders, the grass follows the wind. The secretary takes the lead and goes on an expedition. Red flags flutter all over the fields, and the commune members are as motivated as a charge. Three days of farm work are finished in one day, just like a fire burning a warship riding the east wind. (An'guo, Hebei)
	Secretary Zhao is experimenting with nutrient pots, wanting to greatly increase cotton production, and humbly learning good experiences. Nutrient pots are really good and indispensable for increasing cotton production. Secretary Zhao is really capable, leading cadres to conduct experiments. Learning about cotton nutrient pots, making twenty-three per minute. Conforming to specifications and of good quality, cadres and masses all praise it. (Xiangyang, Hubei)
	The county head takes the lead. The sound of gongs and drums, like an army marching, supports deep plowing, the county head takes the lead. (Jieyang, Guangdong)
	I'll choose you to be a model. Leading the cattle up the mountain, singing songs to the white clouds, singing about the good County Head Wang, who came to our village to study production. Working hard from dawn to dusk, consulting with old farmers carefully. We call out County Head Wang, I want to choose you to be a model. (Changle, Fujian)

    赵书记试验营养钵要想棉花大增产，虚心学习好经验。营养钵，真正好，增产棉花离不了。赵书记，真能干，带领干部搞试验。学习棉花营养钵，分钟能做二十三。合乎规格质量好，干部群众齐称赞。（湖北襄阳）
    县长带头行锣鼓叮咚声，人马如行军，支援深翻地，县长带头行。　（广东揭阳）
    选你当模范赶着牛儿上了山，歌声唱到白云端，歌唱好个王县长，来到我村学生产。赶早摸黑拼命干，请教老农细心看，我们叫声王县长，我要选你当模范。（福建长乐）
