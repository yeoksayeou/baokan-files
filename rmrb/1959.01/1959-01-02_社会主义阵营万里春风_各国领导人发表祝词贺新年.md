Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: The New Year's message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to the Soviet people was released here today.

The message stated that 1958 will be remembered by the people as a year of great achievements. Soviet industry overfulfilled the national plan. New and enormous factories and mines, blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, power stations and transportation lines have been put into production. Agriculture is increasingly flourishing. Soviet science and technology have become richer due to new inventions and research.

The message continued that the big family of socialist countries, the militant revolutionary unity of fraternal communist and workers' parties, has been further strengthened in the past year. The Soviet Union's bold and far-sighted foreign policy has been recognized worldwide.

The message said that we will enter the new year - 1959, the first year of the nationwide movement to realize the Seven-Year Plan. In these seven years, the Soviet Union will take a decisive step in building the material and technical foundation of communism.

The message said: The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union will continue to work for world peace, the friendship between all peoples, the peaceful coexistence of different social systems, the cessation of the arms race, and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet government held a New Year's reception in the Grand Kremlin on New Year's Eve. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, gave a congratulatory speech to those present.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 31st: Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a New Year's greeting to all citizens of the German Democratic Republic and compatriots throughout Germany.

President Pieck wished for lasting peace in 1959. Pieck said that the unity of the socialist countries and all peace-loving people is a guarantee of further victory in the struggle against the provocations of the imperialist warmongers.

Pieck said that the German people bear a particularly important responsibility in the struggle for peace. He pointed out that West Germany has become the most dangerous place for war instigators to carry out their activities.

Pieck then said that the government of the German Democratic Republic will continue to fight alongside the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to normalize the situation in West Berlin on the basis of mutual understanding.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, wrote in his New Year's message entitled "A Decisive Year": "As we approach the end of 1958, it is clear that we have reached a turning point, which is reflected in the victories achieved in building socialism and consolidating the worker-peasant power of the German Democratic Republic, and in the improvement of the people's living standards."

Referring to the national question, Ulbricht emphasized that in 1959, the German people must make greater efforts to solve this problem. The core of this problem is to defeat German militarism and imperialism.

Ulbricht said that it is time for all the German people to strive for the demilitarization of West Berlin, for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and for an understanding between the two Germanies on the issue of troop reductions.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 31st: Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Republic, said in his New Year's radio address today that the Czechoslovak industrial production plan had never been completed as well as it was in 1958. The vast majority of enterprises had completed their annual production plans before Christmas, and industrial production is expected to increase by about 12%, with labor productivity increasing by 7.5%. The President expressed his gratitude to the working people who contributed to these good results. He especially praised the excellent achievements of the miners.

We will further enhance our friendship with Asian and African countries, especially our neighbors like India and Indonesia, and other neighbors. The Vietnamese people will further strive to safeguard world peace. We will also strive to help the International Commission to ensure the correct implementation of the Geneva Accords."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 1st: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, said today at the New Year's celebration banquet he held, that in 1959, Korea's socialist construction will achieve even greater victories.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that in 1958, Korea's industrial production increased by 37% compared to 1957. If it can increase by another 32% this year compared to 1958, Korea will complete its first five-year plan two years ahead of schedule. Kim Il-sung said that in 1958, the Korean countryside realized cooperation and produced 3.7 million tons of grain; this year, Korea's grain output will reach more than 5 million tons. Basic victories will also be achieved in rural electrification this year, which will promote the comprehensive mechanization of the countryside and will give a new look to the countryside.

He said that Korea will continue to carry out the cultural revolution in the new year. In order to build socialism faster and better and shorten the road to communism, communist education for the working people should be strengthened.
