    Rocket Rhyme
    Wei Zhuo
    According to foreign news reports: After the Soviet Union's space rocket ascended to the heavens, American congressmen became very anxious and demanded that the American government "intensify space work." The U.S. Department of Defense was very embarrassed and dared not comment on the red rocket's journey to the moon. However, the American space expert Little Henry Richter said with admiration, "That's really a remarkable big fellow." British astronomer Lovell said that it was "unexpected," while British space expert Professor Massey was so surprised that he couldn't help but whistle. The rocket speeds to the moon, interstellar travel is within reach. White arrows fall while red arrows rise, what bragging does the U.S. still have left? The gossiping congressmen are anxious, the arrogant military lowers its head. Experts and scholars are in disarray, both surprised and delighted: some stick out their tongues and whistle, some repeatedly say "remarkable." No matter what they say, this is a great victory for mankind. The rocket frequently sends joyful news, a sound that is loud, clear, and unparalleled.

    火箭谣

    据外电：苏联宇宙火箭上天后，美国的议员们大为着急，要求美国政府“加紧空间工作”。美国国防部非常狼狈，对于红色火箭奔月这件事，不敢发表评论。但美国空间专家小亨利·里克特则不无惊羡地说：“那真是一个了不起的大家伙”；英国天文学家洛弗申说，这是“出乎意外”的，而英国空间专家马西教授则惊奇得不禁发出吹口哨的声音。火箭奔月去如飞，星际航行已可期。白箭坠落红箭起，美国还吹甚牛皮？嚼舌议员干着急，骄横军部把头低。专家学者乱纷纷，又是吃惊又是喜：有的吐舌吹口哨，有的连说了不起。不管他们说什么，这是人类大胜利。火箭频将喜信传，响亮清澈声无比。
