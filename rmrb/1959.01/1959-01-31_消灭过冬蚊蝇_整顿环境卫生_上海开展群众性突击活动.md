Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 30th: Shanghai is launching a mass campaign centered on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, digging out fly pupae, and vigorously improving environmental sanitation, with every household carrying out a major cleaning to welcome the Spring Festival in a clean and tidy manner.

The 800 pest control technicians trained in residential areas, factories, shops, schools, and government offices in Luwan District have been deployed to various areas and units to inspect, guide, and eliminate pests. Many neighborhood committees have established pest control headquarters, organizing the masses to fight in the cold to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies and destroy hidden cockroach and bedbug nests. In recent days, the Tilanqiao District has mobilized the masses to conduct a comprehensive investigation and thorough cleaning of mosquito and fly breeding grounds and places where overwintering mosquitoes and flies may be hiding. In the suburban areas, efforts are being made to eliminate fly pupae in manure vats, pig pens, and other places.

All districts have been working to improve environmental sanitation and strengthen sanitation maintenance in their areas. The Tilanqiao District has adjusted the sanitation maintenance organizations on main streets, implementing a segmented responsibility system and establishing a "three sweeps a day, sweep whenever it's dirty" system. In addition to strengthening sanitation maintenance and establishing a system of flushing sewers twice a day and having dedicated personnel manage public spittoons and waste bins, Luwan District has organized medical personnel, shop assistants, vendors, and performing arts unit workers to conduct large-scale sanitation publicity activities from January 25th. Before the Spring Festival, the district will conduct two large-scale campaigns to sweep the streets and wash waste bins, garbage bins, and outdated slogans and advertisements to ensure that every household, alley, and street is clean and tidy.

The Shanghai Third Commercial Bureau, which is specifically responsible for managing the catering and service industries, has also recently strengthened the management of food and bathing and barbering hygiene.

    消灭过冬蚊蝇　整顿环境卫生
    上海开展群众性突击活动
    据新华社上海30日电　家家户户大扫除，干干净净迎春节，上海市正在展开一个以消灭过冬蚊蝇、挖掘蝇蛹和大搞环境卫生为中心的群众性突击活动。
    卢湾区在各地居民、工厂、商店、学校、机关中训练的除七害技术员八百人，已分别到各地区、各单位边检查、边指导、边除害。很多居民委员会都成立了灭害指挥部，组织广大群众冒寒作战，消灭过冬蚊蝇和捣毁隐藏的臭虫、蟑螂巢穴。提篮桥区连日来发动了群众对蚊蝇孳生地和可能隐藏越冬蚊蝇的地方进行全面调查和彻底清除。近郊地带还在粪缸、猪棚等处，大力消灭蝇蛹。
    各区都进行了整顿环境卫生、加强地段保洁的工作。提篮桥区已调整主要街道的地段保洁组织，实行分段包干，建立“一日三扫、见脏就扫”的制度。卢湾区除加强地段保洁和建立了一日两次冲洗下水道、专人管理公共痰盂、废料箱等制度外，从25日开始组织了医务人员、店员、摊贩及文娱单位工作人员进行大规模卫生宣传活动；在春节前，全区内将进行两次大规模突击清扫马路，洗刷废物箱、垃圾箱和过时标语、广告的活动，使家家户户、里弄、马路都干干净净。
    专门负责管理饮食、服务行业的上海市第三商业局最近也加强了对食品和沐浴、理发业清洁卫生工作的管理。
