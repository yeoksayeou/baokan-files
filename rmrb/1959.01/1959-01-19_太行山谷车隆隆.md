    North to Taihang Mountain,
    How majestic and towering the hardship!
    The sheep's intestines slope winding,
    The wheels are broken.
    According to the records of the Shangdang Prefecture Chronicle: In the past, Cao Cao drove north to Taihang, "rushed into the steepness of Taihang, and entered the high pass of Tianjing," smashing his small car. In anger, Mengde picked up his pen and wrote the above poem. According to Cao Cao, is it just a dream to want to drive a car in this place!
    Actually, it's no wonder Cao Cao was too arbitrary. After one or two thousand years, until 1945, there were only more than 20,000 horse-drawn iron-wheeled carts, coal carts, and human-powered wheelbarrows in the entire southeastern Shanxi region. From the beginning to the end of the year, the working people, whether carrying rice, firewood, coal, or manure, always carried a hundred-jin burden on their shoulders, climbing over mountains and ridges, turning through gullies and up slopes, carrying it out and carrying it back. Sweat, carrying poles, and shoulders were condensed together. People described shoulder-carrying labor as "grit your teeth and change shoulders, go up the slope and stare wide-eyed."
    Under the leadership of the Party, over the past ten years or so, with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, various vehicles have developed rapidly. By the end of the year before last, there were a total of 120,000 vehicles in the entire district. In 1958, first came the high tide of water conservancy construction, followed by the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. With this leap after leap, new tasks raised new problems, and new difficulties forced out soaring enthusiasm. In less than a year, who would have expected that the number of vehicles in the entire region would develop to 600,000, and trains would be running in the Taihang Mountains!
      "Toad Carts" Display Power
  on Water Conservancy Construction Sites
    In March 1958, 700,000 laborers in this district were engaged in large-scale water conservancy projects. In order to complete the water conservancy construction ahead of schedule and complete the sowing on time, everyone wished to build the reservoir in one go, freeing up their hands to organize land preparation, fertilizer transportation, and sowing. From Taihang Mountain to Dayue Mountain, from both sides of the Zhang River to the Shangdang Plain, there was a chorus of struggle everywhere. Under the slogan of the Great Leap Forward, who would be willing to show weakness in the face of tasks?
    At the "Crossing the Yellow River" Reservoir construction site in Xiangyuan, there was a young migrant worker named Huang Rongfu. Carrying soil for a day, he could only carry 40 loads, earning only three and a half work points, and his shoulders would ache so much that he would groan when he returned at night. His father, a "capable" person in the village, found some scrap wood and made him a "toad cart." Since Rongfu had this treasure, he could happily push the cart to transport soil during the day, working really hard. He could push 80 carts a day, equivalent to 160 loads, earning twelve work points. He would happily push the cart home at night, and he didn't even feel tired. Comrade Wu Xueshun, the Organization Minister of the District Committee, who came to the construction site to inspect the work, discovered this problem and helped the construction site hold an on-site meeting, achieving vehicleization of soil transportation on the construction site in seven days. This alone saved 80,000 workdays for this construction site of more than 2,000 people, and the reservoir project could be completed ahead of schedule.
    This news spread to the neighboring Tunliu County, where the largest Jiang River "August 1st" Reservoir construction site in the entire district was under intense construction. Tens of thousands of military and civilian workers also followed this method and completed the vehicleization of the reservoir construction site. The commando team members put down their carrying poles and pushed the carts, stretched their waists, and their faces floated with healthy smiles. Pushing soil was like jogging, transporting soil and stone at an efficiency several times to ten times higher.
    Tunliu County First
      Achieved Vehicleization
    Such a small reform has such great power. Can vehicleization only be applied to water conservancy construction sites? This opened up ideas for the Tunliu County Party Committee, which was organizing sowing. The county has a large area of land but a small population, with an average of more than five mu of cultivated land per person. Over the years, yields have been low due to the large area of land, lack of labor, and rough cultivation. In 1958, the unit area yield was required to be 500 jin per mu. In addition, a large number of developments in pig raising, afforestation, soil and water conservation, road construction, and industrial development were required. In total, to ensure timely sowing, even with the highest attendance rate in the county, there was still a shortage of 1.64 million workdays that could not be solved. The new contradiction caused a new debate. Some members of the county party committee advocated learning from the water conservancy construction site method, reforming tools, and promoting vehicleization; others believed that "there are not many water conservancy construction sites, so vehicleization can be implemented. If the whole county does this, the time is short and the task is tight, how can it be done?"
    If there are difficulties, go to the masses. One evening in late March, the Tunliu County Party Committee exceptionally held a county committee meeting. At this meeting, two iron and woodworking workers from the agricultural tool cooperative and handicraft cooperative were invited, as well as a physics teacher from a middle school. They attended the county committee meeting and debated with the county committee. Reservoirs must be completed on schedule, crops must be sown in a timely manner, pigs cannot be raised less, trees cannot be planted less, what should be done? Can we only rely on hard work day and night? This meeting was really lively. The county committee, plus workers, politics plus technology, a heated debate, researched the implementation of transportation vehicleization throughout the county, double-headed hoe for sowing, level land with leveling rakes, and transformation of all water wheels. With these four transformations, labor efficiency can be greatly improved. Calculations show that in addition to making up for the labor shortage, there is also a surplus. However, county committee members with conservative ideas raised new questions, "How much wood and how many iron and woodworking workers are needed to implement the four transformations throughout the county? It is necessary but impossible." The atmosphere in the county committee meeting room seemed particularly tense, because whether it could be done or not would determine whether to do it or not, and the struggle proceeded to seize every stage. When the problem of insufficient wood was raised, the carpenter spoke
  "Um! Making small carts does not require whole wood. Every farmer's family has a few pieces of scrap wood. If you clean them up, one family can make a cart with plenty to spare." "What about carpenters? This problem is also easy to solve. Just let the carpenters give the lines, and the farmers will cooperate to saw. The carpenters will do the fine work, and they will do the rough work themselves. One cart will take at most two and a half workdays." "What about iron? Use the commune members' old farm tools and add some scrap iron, and it's not a problem." Conservative ideas were broken one by one, and the county committee made a decision to fight hard for a month to achieve the four transformations. The movement was carried out victoriously, with 7,000 carts made in seven days, and vehicleization was achieved throughout the county in half a month.
  A District-Wide Upsurge in
    Tool Reform Movement
    In early April of the same year, at the meeting of county party secretaries convened by the district committee, fifteen county party secretaries presented a red flag of "The First Vehicleized County in the District" to Tunliu. The secretaries of various counties visited the vehicleization of the Tunjiang Reservoir construction site, visited the achievements of Tunliu County in achieving "four transformations," visited the farmers who happily worked after dropping their carrying poles, and saw with their own eyes the brilliant achievements of solving the labor shortage in this county with a large area of land and a small population.
    "If Tunliu County can do it, why can't we?" The question turned in the minds of many county party secretaries. On the evening of the day the meeting adjourned, the Licheng County Party Committee made a decision and issued a notice overnight, requiring two days of mobilization and preparation, and convening an on-site meeting on the third day. Under the leadership of the secretary and the mobilization of the entire party, the county fought hard for five days and nights, adding more than 6,000 new vehicles, ten times more than the original number of vehicles. In this small county with a population of 100,000, this was a remarkable miracle. The Longwangmiao Village Worker-Peasant Cooperative in the county had more than 200 male and female laborers. In addition to the 80 people who were transferred to support the key construction site of Zhangbei Canal, 106 people had to carry water from the Zhang River, more than 30 miles away from the village, every day, leaving only a dozen full-time laborers to participate in field work. The plans for land preparation and fertilizer transportation were unlikely to be completed on schedule. After vehicleization was realized, it was enough to extract seven carts to pull water every day, and the rest of the people went to the fields. The water cart entered the village, and the old women carrying pots and jars came to fetch water. Their first sentence was "Chairman Mao has done another good thing for Longwangmiao Village, and we have turned over again."
    The tool reform wave centered on vehicleization swept through the Taihang Mountains. High-altitude soil transport carts, pigeon somersault carts, three-wheeled small flat carts, small surrounding carts, phoenix double wing carts, live disc Taiping carts, gravity rolling carts, topdressing carts, children's carts, mother-child carts, wooden rail earth trains, etc., more than 60 different styles of various human-powered carts and animal-powered carts appeared in various reservoir construction sites, mining areas, forest areas, and fields. Up to now, the number of various vehicles in the entire district has increased to 600,000, with an average of one vehicle per household. Fertilizing, pulling mines, transporting coal, delivering mountain goods, in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward, the entire Taihang Mountain Valley is rumbling with the sound of vehicles.
    During the vehicleization movement, some people also criticized
  "What toad carts, rabbit carts, made quickly, broken quickly, what's the use!" But people ignored these criticisms. They worked hard to complete their wishes according to their own conditions. If the car broke, it would be repaired again. If it was completely rotten, a new one would be built. They corrected the shortcomings in the creation, sought improvement on the basis of popularization, and installed ball bearings on most of the cars, added trailers to the cars, and implemented car trainization. In 1958, this batch of various cars became a powerful helper for the workers and peasants, completed an unprecedentedly magnificent task, and created historical achievements. This year, a total of 320 million cubic meters of earth and stone projects were completed in water conservancy construction; a total of 2.4 billion dan of fertilizer were transported (twice as much as the previous year), and a total of 5 billion jin of grain were transported back (four times as much as the previous year), completing the transportation task of 4.15 million tons of steel production ore, wood, and coal (more than ten times as much as the previous year). If the annual industrial and agricultural production and transportation volume still relied on a carrying pole, it would take more than two years to complete if all 1.2 million male and female laborers in the entire district were fully invested. However, more things were done in other aspects this year: an average of more than 20 times of processing per mu of 8.6 million mu of farmland, the newly added water land exceeded three times the total historical water land, 6.32 million mu of afforestation, 1.9 billion trees were planted, pig raising increased by two times, steel production increased by ten times, and 60,000 laborers were drawn to develop township and community industries. Without the vehicleization and tool reform movement, so many things could not be done. The farmers praised the vehicleization "Vehicleization has many advantages, it saves both people and effort, it pushes lightly and transports a lot, it can take detours and climb slopes, and you don't need to carry the pole on your shoulders anymore."
    Prepared Conditions
        for All People to Run Industry
    The tool reform movement centered on vehicleization mobilized the masses, liberated their minds, and broke superstitions. How to be efficient? How to save labor? These became the general topics of debate for millions of people. What to do, what to debate, what tools to reform. Zhang Minshuo and Zhang Qiuqi, workers of the Xiangyuan Handicraft Cooperative, created a human-powered high-irrigation water pump, which can lift water five or six feet. Liu Chouji, a member of the Huoxing Cooperative in Luocun, Tunliu, created a ditching plow, which improved efficiency by 15 times. Li Huaqin, a seventeen-year-old girl from Lu'an, created and imitated 21 kinds of improved agricultural tools, and Wu Hongjun and others, workers of the Guguan Iron Factory, created a molten iron insulation bag. All kinds of soil seeders, soil levels, replanting machines, thinning machines, and various cutting and processing machines were created in thousands of ways. In the mass movement of technological revolution, 260,000 "all-rounders" and "native experts" and 200,000 "clever girls" emerged in the entire district. In this active force of nearly 500,000 people in the technological revolution, there were original iron and woodworkers in the countryside, as well as elementary and junior high school students who had just graduated; there were old grandfathers, and there were also little girls. They formed various research groups, both farmers and workers. All "farmers cannot make tools,"
  "small factories cannot make machines," "no equipment, no technology, no raw materials cannot make machines" and other superstitious ideas were broken, making ideological mobilization, organizational preparation, and backbone training for indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and running industry by the whole people.
    People are not satisfied with this, Chairman Mao told us to carry out continuous revolution, and people's ambition to transform nature is greater and their enthusiasm is greater. On October 1, 1958, the first civilian-run railway extending from the Shangdang Basin to the Taihang Mountains—the Xi'anli Railway—had been opened to traffic; on November 1, the first earthen railway with a total length of three kilometers built by the Dayang Hongqi People's Commune in Jincheng County had been opened to traffic; after a month of hard work in October, the district created a new record of daily output (31st) of 400,000 tons of iron and 70,000 tons of steel, exceeding 40% of the annual steel production task. At present, the people of the whole region are riding the wind and waves to advance towards "four indigenousizations"—various people's communes are making a lot of indigenous mechanization, indigenous electrification, indigenous machine toolization, and indigenous railroadization, and a rural industrialization upsurge centered on four indigenousizations is booming.
    Please, if Cao Cao were alive, what would he say?

    太行山谷车隆隆
    李旺先
    北上太行山，
    艰截何巍巍！
    羊肠坂诘屈，
    车轮为之摧。
    据上党府志记载：昔年曹操驱车北上太行，“驰太行之险峻，入天井之高关”把他的小车给撞烂了，孟德在气恼之下，提笔写了上面的一首诗。按照曹操的看法，这个地方想要走车子吗？终归是梦想！
    其实也难怪曹操太武断，时间过了一、两千年，一直到1945年，晋东南地区所有的马拉铁轮车、烧并车、人力独轮车，总共也不过有两万多辆。劳动人民从年初到年终，不论挑米运柴担煤送粪，一条百斤重担常年不离肩膀地爬山越岭，转沟上坡，挑出去又挑回来。汗水、扁担和肩膀凝结在一起，人们形容肩挑劳动是“咬咬牙换换肩，上上坡瞪瞪眼”。
    在党的领导下，十几年来，随着农业合作化运动的开展，各种车辆得到了较快发展。到前年年底，全专区共有各种车十二万辆。1958年，先是水利建设高潮，继则农业生产大跃进，工农业全面大跃进。就这么一跃再跃，新的任务提出了新的问题，新的困难逼出了冲天干劲。不到一年功夫，有谁会料到，全区车辆发展到六十万辆，太行山里会通了火车啊！
      “蛤蟆车”在
  水利工地抖威力
    1958年3月，这个专区有七十万个劳力正在大兴水利。为了提前完成水利建设，按时完成播种，大家恨不得一蹴而就的修好水库，腾出手来组织整地运肥下种。从太行山到大岳山，从漳河两岸到上党平川，到处一片奋战声，在大跃进的口号下，有谁愿意在任务面前示弱呢？
    襄垣“渡黄”水库工地，有一个青年民工叫黄荣福，担一天土方，只能担四十担土，顶三分半工，晚上回来肩膀疼得直哼哼。他的父亲是村上一位“能”人，找了些碎木料，给他做了一辆“蛤蟆车”。荣福自从有了这件宝，白天在工地上蹦蹦跳跳推着小车运土方，干的真够欢，一天可推八十车，合一百六十担，可以计工十二分，晚上高高兴兴推着小车回了家，也不显得累。来工地视察工作的地委组织部长武学舜同志发现了这个问题，帮助工地召开了一次现场会，七天实现工地运土车辆化。仅这一项，就使得这个两千多人的工地节省出八万个劳动工，水库工程可提前完成。
    这个风声传到了邻近县份屯留县，正在紧张施工的全区规模最大的绛河“八一”水库，有数万军工民工，也仿照这个办法，完成了水库工地车子化。突击队员们，放下了扁担，推起了小车，伸展了腰身，脸上浮动着矫健的微笑，推土好比小跑步，以提高工效数倍到十数倍的效率运输土方石方。
    屯留县首先
      实现车子化
    一种微小改革就有这么大威力，车子化只能适用于水库工地吗？给正在组织播种的屯留县委打开了思路。这个县地多人少，每人平均耕地五亩多，历年来就是因为地多劳力缺耕作粗糙，产量一直上不来。1958年单位面积产量要求亩产五百斤，再加上大量发展养猪、造林、水土保持、修路、办工业等等，合计下来，要保证适时完成播种，全县以最高的出勤率计算，还缺一百六十四万个劳动日无法解决。新的矛盾引起了新的争论，县委当中有人主张学水库工地办法，改革工具，推广车子化；有的认为“水库工地为数不多，可以实行车子化。全县都这样干，时间短任务紧，那怎行？”
    有了困难就去找群众，3月下旬的一个晚上，屯留县委破例召开了一次县委会。在这个会议上，请来了农具社、手工业社两位铁木工人，还请了中学一位物理教员，他们列席了县委会议，和县委一齐辩论。水库要按期完成，庄稼要适时下种，猪不能少养，树不能少栽，怎办呢？光靠昼夜苦战吗？这次会议可真算热闹了，县委加工人，政治加技术，一场热烈辩论，研究出全县实行运输车辆化，点种双头鋜化，平整土地平地耙化，所有水车改装化。就这么四化，可以大大提高劳动效率，计算下来除补足劳力不足还有了剩余。但是有保守思想的县委委员又提出新的问题，“全县实行四化，得多少木料，得多少铁木工人？倒是需要就是不可能”。县委会议室的气氛显得格外紧张，因为能与不能，将决定干与不干，斗争进行到争夺每一个阶段。当提出木料不足的问题时，木工说话了
  “嗯！做小车不用整木料，农民谁家也有几根碎木块，收拾一下，一家做一个车子富足有余”。“木匠吗？这个问题也好解决，只用木工给下线，农民互助扯锯子，细活木工干，粗活自己干，一辆车子顶多两个半工。”“铁料吗？用社员的旧农具，再添补点碎铁，也不成问题。”保守思想受到了各个击破，县委做出了苦战一月实现四化的决定。运动胜利地开展着，七天搞了车子七千辆，半月实现全县车辆化。
  全专区掀起
    工具改革运动
    同年4月上旬，地委召开的各县县委书记会议，十五位县委书记把一面“全区第一个车子化县”的红旗送到了屯留。各县书记们参观了屯绛水库工地的车子化，参观了屯留县实现“四化”的成果，访问了丢掉扁担愉快劳动的农民，亲眼看到了在这个地多劳力少的县份解决劳力紧张的光辉成就。
    “屯留县行，为什么我们不行？”问题在许多县委书记的脑子转开了。散会的当天晚上，黎城县委做出了一项决定，并星夜发出通知，要求两天发动准备，第三天召开现场会议。这个县在书记挂帅全党动员下，苦战了五个昼夜，新增加了六千多辆车子，比原有车辆增加了十倍。在这个十万人口的小县里，这是一件不得了的奇迹。该县龙王庙村工农合作社共有二百多个男女劳力，除过调走八十多人支援漳北渠重点工地之外，每天还得有一百零六人到离村三十多里的漳河挑水，留下参加田间劳动的人只有十多个全劳力，整地运肥计划眼看不能按期完成。实现车子化后，每天抽出七辆车子拉水就够了，其余的人都到了田间。水车进村了，提着坛坛罐罐的老大娘们来接水了，他们第一句话就是“毛主席又给龙王庙村办了一件好事，我们又翻了一次身”。
    以车子化为中心的工具改革浪潮席卷太行山。什么高空运土车、鸽子翻身车、三轮小平车、小围行车、凤凰双展翅车、活盘太平车、重力滚车、追肥车、少年车、母子车、木轨土火车等等，六十多种不同式样的各种人力车、畜力车，出现在各个水库工地、矿区、林区与田间。到目前为止全区各种车辆增加到六十万辆，一户平均到一辆车。运肥的、拉矿的、运煤的、送山货的，在大跃进的行列里，整个太行山谷车声隆隆。
    车子化运动中，也有人批评过
  “什么蛤蟆车、兔子车，造的快、坏的也快，中啥用！”但是人们没有理睬这些，他们根据自己的条件在努力完成自己的愿望。车子坏了重新修起来，完全烂了再造辆新的，在创造中改正缺点，在普及基础上求得提高，并把大部分车子装置了滚珠轴承，把汽车加上拖车，实行汽车列车化。1958年，这批各式各样的车子成为工农群众的有力帮手，完成了空前宏伟的巨大任务，创造了历史功绩。这一年，水利建设共完成土、石方工程三亿二千万公方；共运出肥料二十四亿担（比前年增大两倍），共运回粮食五十亿斤（比前年翻两番），完成钢铁生产矿石、木柴、煤炭等运输任务四百一十五万吨（比前年加大十倍多）。全年工农业生产运输量，如果还靠一条扁担办事，按全区一百二十万男女劳力全部投入，也得整整两年多时间才能完成。然而，这一年其他方面的事做的更多：八百六十万亩农田每亩平均加工二十多个，新增水地超过历史水地总和三倍，造林六百三十二万亩，植树十九亿株，养猪增加两倍，钢铁产量翻了十番，还抽出六万个劳力发展了乡社工业。不是车子化与工具改革运动怎么也办不了这样多事情。农民歌颂车子化“小车化好处多，既省人又省力，推的轻运的多，能走弯路能上坡，再不用扁担压肩膀”。
    为全民办工业
        准备了条件
    以车子化为中心的工具改革运动，动员了群众，解放了思想，破除了迷信，怎样效率高？怎样省劳力？成了千百万群众辩论的总题目。做什么，辩论什么，改什么工具。襄垣手工业社工人张民锁、张秋奇创造了人力高灌抽水机，可扬水五、六丈。屯留络村火星社社员刘丑计创造的开沟犁，效率提高十五倍。潞安十七岁姑娘李华琴创造与仿制各种改良农具二十一种，故县铁厂工人吴鸿钧等创造了铁水保温包。什么土播种机、土水平仪、补种机、间苗器、各种各样切削加工机千般百样的创造出来。在技术革命的群众运动中，全专区出现了“万宝全”“土专家”二十六万人，
  “巧姑娘”二十万人。这一支近五十万人的技术革命积极分子队伍里，有农村中原来的铁木匠，也有刚出学校大门的高小初中生；有年老大爷，也有小姑娘。他们组成了各式各样的研究小组，既是农民，又是工人。一切“农民不能造工具”，
  “小工厂不能造机械”，“没设备、没技术、没原料不能造机械”等等迷信思想破除了，给土法上马、土洋并举，全民大办工业做了思想大动员，组织大准备，骨干大训练。
    人们没有以此为满足，毛主席告诉我们要实行不断革命，在改造自然斗争中人们的雄心更大干劲更足了。1958年10月1日，从上党盆地延伸到太行山里的第一条民办铁路——西安里铁路已经通车；11月1日，晋城县大阳红旗人民公社自办的第一条全长三公里的土铁路已经通车；经过10月份苦战，全区创造了日产（31日）四十万吨铁，七万吨钢的新纪录，超额40％完成了全年钢铁生产任务。目前全区人民正乘风破浪向“四土化”进军——各个人民公社正在大闹土机械化，土电机化、土机床化、土铁路化，一个以四土化为中心的农村工业化高潮正在蓬勃发展。
    请问，如果曹操在世，他该再说些什么呢？
