Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 8th: Chongqing's commercial departments, under the leadership of local Party and government officials, are comprehensively arranging the economic lives of the city's people.

Due to the Great Leap Forward in various construction projects, a large number of housewives have left their homes to participate in production. This has brought about significant changes in the lives of Chongqing residents, with many former household chores now becoming matters of common social concern. In order to organize the people's economic lives effectively, area-based economic life management committees have been established throughout the city. Under the leadership of these committees, commercial departments are taking on the responsibility of guiding the masses in matters of food, clothing, and daily necessities.

Commercial departments are starting by assisting the masses in running public canteens effectively. On the one hand, they are assisting existing canteens in government agencies, factories, and mines by actively organizing sources of goods and resolving the issue of non-staple food supplies. On the other hand, they are assisting residents in establishing street-level public canteens. For these street-level public canteens, in addition to assisting the streets in conducting political and ideological education among residents, commercial departments are also helping them solve the difficulties of large pots, stoves, and housing equipment; assisting in training chefs to improve cooking skills; and helping to solve the problem of non-staple food supplies. With the strong assistance of commercial departments, more than 4,000 public canteens of various types have now been established throughout the city. Commercial departments also operate some restaurants with local flavors to meet the diverse needs of the masses. The commercial departments also provide as much care as possible for the special dietary needs of the elderly, weak, sick, disabled, pregnant, young, and orphaned. In addition to appropriate care in the distribution of non-staple foods, public canteens have special seats for the elderly, weak, pregnant, and sick, preparing food suitable for them, and providing special care. Restaurants and canteens also conditionally offer processing services, such as stir-frying dishes, cooking rice, steaming buns, and processing dumplings, and have opened nutritional restaurants specializing in nourishing foods.

In terms of clothing, Chongqing is expanding the supply of ready-made clothes, shoes, and hats while actively organizing sewing groups and laundry groups. In the central district alone, 30 simple laundries and mending service departments have been established. They undertake monthly laundry services, exchange old for new, make children's clothes, and offer services such as mending clothes, sewing buttons, changing collars, and sewing sock bottoms at low prices, which are welcomed by the masses.

Chongqing has many teahouses, which are a favorite place for working people to rest. The commercial departments are systematically transforming these teahouses into mass-based simple clubs, where people can not only drink tea but also play chess, play cards, read books, organize folk artists to perform comic dialogues, storytelling, and Sichuan opera, greatly enriching the cultural life of the masses. In addition, more tiger stoves selling water have been added in densely populated areas, and public canteens provide boiled water and hot water, solving the problem of drinking water and water use for the masses.

Regarding bathing, haircuts, and other issues, commercial departments are also trying to add simple showers with low fees in the original bathhouses, organize the masses to run simple bathhouses themselves, promote the establishment of bathhouses by factories, mines, government agencies, and schools, and actively train new barbers.

The Chongqing commercial departments have learned from practice that organizing the people's lives well is a very arduous and complex task. It is not only an economic task but also a political task and a mass work task. It cannot be handled by the commercial departments alone. In addition to strengthening the cooperation and coordination of various relevant departments, it is even more important to rely closely on the masses, organize the masses, and let the masses manage their own lives.

    重庆商业部门开展新业务
    帮助公共食堂训练厨师提高烹调技术；组织缝纫组、洗衣店承办包月洗衣、换旧翻新、钉扣、换领、上袜底等业务；把茶馆改造成简易俱乐部，可以喝茶、下棋、玩扑克、听川戏。
    新华社重庆8日电　重庆市商业部门在当地党政领导下，正在全面地安排城市人民的经济生活。
    由于各项建设事业的大跃进，大批家庭妇女走出家门参加生产，重庆市居民的生活发生了很大变化，原来的许多家务事，现在已成为社会上共同关心的事情。为了把人民群众的经济生活组织好，全市普遍成立了地区性的经济生活管理委员会，在这些委员会的领导下，商业部门担负起了指导群众吃、穿、用等方面经济生活的责任。
    商业部门首先从协助群众办好公共食堂入手。一方面协助机关、厂矿办好原有的食堂，积极组织货源，解决这些食堂的副食品供应问题；一方面协助居民建立街道公共食堂。对于街道公共食堂，商业部门除了协助街道对居民开展政治思想教育以外，还帮助他们解决大锅、大灶和房屋设备的困难；帮助训练厨师，提高烹调技术；帮助解决副食品供应等问题。在商业部门的大力协助下，目前全市已经办起了各种公共食堂四千多个。商业部门还经营部分富有本地风味的餐厅，以满足群众多方面的需要。对于老、弱、病、残、孕、幼、孤这部分人在饮食方面的特殊需要，商业部门也尽可能地给予照顾。除了在副食品分配上的适当照顾以外，公共食堂专设有老、弱、孕、病席，制作适合他们的伙食，专人照应。餐厅与食堂还有条件地开办代客加工业务，如代客炒菜、煮饭、蒸馒头、加工汤元、饺馅等，并开办了营养餐厅，专门供应滋补食品。
    在穿着方面，重庆市一面扩大成衣、鞋帽等商品的供应，一面积极组织缝纫组、洗衣组。仅市中区就建立了简便的洗衣店和缝补服务部三十个，他们承办包月洗衣、换旧翻新、缝制童服以及补衣、钉扣、换领、上袜底等业务，价格低廉，受到群众欢迎。
    重庆市茶馆较多，它是劳动人民十分喜爱的休息场所，商业部门就有计划地把茶馆改造成为群众性的简易俱乐部，那里不仅有茶喝，而且可以下棋、玩扑克牌、看书，组织民间艺人在茶馆里说相声、讲评书、唱川戏，大大地丰富了群众的文化生活。此外，在人口稠密的地方增设了卖水的老虎灶，公共食堂里供应开水、热水，解决了群众的喝水、用水问题。
    关于洗澡、理发等问题，商业部门也设法在原有浴室里增辟收费低廉的简易淋浴，组织群众自办简易浴室，提倡厂矿、机关、学校自设浴室，以及积极培训新的理发员等。
    重庆市商业部门从实践中体会到把人民生活组织得很好是一项十分艰巨、复杂的任务，它既是经济工作，又是政治工作、群众工作。单靠商业部门是包办不了的，除了加强各有关部门的协作配合以外，更重要的是要紧紧依靠群众，把群众组织起来，让群众自己管理自己的生活。
