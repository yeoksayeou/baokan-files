    Liaocheng Prefecture Vigorously Grasps "Five-izations"
    Diversification of Fertilizer Sources, Acceleration of Fertilizer Production, Scientification of Fertilization
    Improvement of Fertilizer Transportation and Topdressing Tools, Institutionalization of Organizational Leadership

    (Our dispatch) Shandong's Liaocheng Prefecture is vigorously grasping "five-izations" in the fertilizer accumulation campaign: diversification of fertilizer sources, acceleration of fertilizer production, scientification of fertilization, improvement of fertilizer transportation and topdressing tools, and institutionalization of organizational leadership. The more than two million strong fertilizer accumulation army in this prefecture has organized three to five fertilizer accumulation major assaults since winter. From November of last year to January 21st of this year, they have already accumulated and produced more than 1.1 trillion catties of various fertilizers.

    In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, in addition to digging deeply into the original fertilizer sources, various people's communes have also opened up multiple fertilizer sources. For example, in solving the raw material problem for making indigenous chemical fertilizers, a mass movement of "six retentions and six collections" was launched: retain chicken feathers after killing chickens, retain bones after eating meat, retain blood and hooves after slaughtering livestock, retain hair after haircuts, retain ash after burning firewood; purchase miscellaneous bones, miscellaneous hairs, rotten leather scraps, rotten shoe soles, rotten rope ends, and cottonseed hull ash. The 13,000 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants in the entire prefecture can produce more than 40 kinds of fertilizers, and have already produced 27.1 billion catties of chemical fertilizer and 150 million catties of bacterial fertilizer.

    Fertilization methods are developing towards scientification. Originally, the fertilizers produced in this area had a relatively large proportion of nitrogen and quick-acting fertilizers, while the proportion of phosphorus, potassium, and calcium fertilizers was relatively small. How to adapt to the needs of different soils, different crops, and different periods, and give full play to the effectiveness of various fertilizers, is a major problem. Now, various localities have initially explored scientific fertilization experience. Generally, alkaline land is suitable for acidic mixed chemical fertilizers, including nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus fertilizer, potassium fertilizer, and other four types; silty land is suitable for alkaline mixed fertilizers; and general land is suitable for neutral mixed fertilizers. This not only gives indigenous chemical fertilizers a clear production plan, making it easy for the masses to scientifically grasp and use them, but also achieves rational fertilization, reduces fertilizer waste, and maintains soil structure.

    In the matter of fertilizer transportation, in addition to implementing methods such as local accumulation and local use, transporting fine fertilizers to distant places, and transporting coarse fertilizers to nearby places, the prefecture has mostly adopted advanced transportation tools.

    In terms of leadership methods, a four-leader responsibility system is implemented, that is, the county head, commune head, management district director, and production team leader personally take charge. At all levels, fertilizer accumulation offices are also organized to regularly contact the lower levels and spread experience. (Hu Lei, Wang Huaiyuan, etc.)

    聊城专区大抓“五化”
    肥源多样化　造肥速效化　施肥科学化
    运肥追肥工具改良化　组织领导制度化
    本报讯  山东聊城专区在积肥运动中大抓“五化”，即肥源多样化、造肥速效化、施肥科学化、运肥追肥工具改良化、组织领导制度化。这个专区的二百多万积肥大军，入冬以来已经组织了三至五次积肥大突击，从去年11月到今年1月21日止，已积造各种肥料一万一千多亿斤。
    各人民公社在积肥运动中，除了狠狠挖原有的一些肥源外，还开辟了多种肥源。例如在解决造土化肥的原料上，开展了全民六留六收运动：杀鸡留毛，吃肉留骨，宰牲畜留腥水、留蹄，剪头留发，烧柴留灰；收购杂骨、杂毛、烂皮头、烂皮鞋底、烂绳头、棉籽皮灰。全专区一万三千处土化肥厂，可以制造四十多种肥料，已制肥二百七十一亿斤，菌肥一亿五千万斤。
    在施肥方法上要向科学化发展。原来这个地区制造的肥料，以氮肥、速效肥的生产比重较大，磷钾钙肥比重较小，如何适应不同土壤、不同作物、不同时期的需要，充分发挥各种肥料的效能是个大问题，现在各地已经初步摸索到科学施肥的经验。一般碱地适用酸性混合化肥，氮肥，磷肥，钾肥等四种；淤地适用碱性混合肥；一般土地适合中性混合肥。这样不仅使土化肥有了明确的生产计划，使群众易于科学的掌握使用，同时也达到了合理施肥，减少了肥料的浪费、保养了土壤结构。
    这个专区在运肥问题上，除了贯彻就地积造就地使用，细肥上远地、粗肥上近地等方法以外，大都采用了先进的运输工具。
    在领导方法上实行了四长负责制，即县长、社长、管理区主任、生产队长亲自掌握，各级还组织了积肥办公室，定期和下层联系，传播经验。　　（胡雷、王怀远等）
