(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 21st) The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province has achieved great results in rectifying and consolidating the work of the people's communes by adopting methods of summarizing achievements, commending advanced elements, and focusing on grasping positive factors. According to statistics from seven counties and cities, more than 1,500 of the more than 10,000 cadres from counties, communes, and production brigades who participated in the rectification and cadre expansion meetings were commended. Incomplete statistics from twelve counties including Fanshi, Hequ, and Zuoyun show that as many as 98,000 grassroots cadres and commune members were commended during the rectification, including more than 20,000 Communist Party members. Truly, there are models in every industry and banners in every commune and team. Precisely because of this, a new situation has emerged in the rectification, where everyone feels happy and everyone's enthusiasm is high. The broad masses of commune members see from 1958 to 1959, from today to tomorrow, and thus actively participate in the rectification work, enabling this more than one month of rectification work to achieve significant results. For example, the Yaozitou People's Commune in Shuoxian County, when conducting rectification and consolidation work, paid attention to grasping positive factors from the beginning, so commune members involved in the airing of views movement accounted for 90% of all commune members. The Yaozitou Brigade of this commune originally had incorrect methods, and commune members were not very active in airing their views. On the third day, they changed their approach, starting from summarizing the achievements and experiences of 1958. As a result, the more the commune members summarized, the happier they became, the more they felt the commune was lovable, and the more actively they aired their views. Before the rectification of the commune began, the number of people working on water conservancy construction was around 300, but after the rectification began, it soared to more than 840, and the work efficiency of each person per day also increased by 40%. More than 2,500 people in the manure accumulation army accumulated more than 73 million dan of fertilizer in just five days, so that the basic farmland of this commune had an average of 130,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Another example is the Dengta Commune in Zuoyun, which originally could not carry out distribution work due to unclear output verification. After mobilizing commune members to start from summarizing the great achievements and significance of the leap forward in 1958 through the method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, a mass movement of output verification was launched. In less than half a month, the distribution work of all sixty-eight villages in the commune was completed.

The Jinbei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to this and actively promoted this experience. Responsible comrades of the Prefectural Committee said: In the great leap forward of 1958, the entire Jinbei area truly witnessed miracles and produced heroes everywhere. The new experiences, new inventions, and new creations of the masses are countless. Especially under the situation of the great leap forward, the people's communes, which emerged as the times require, are like the rising sun, incomparably powerful and radiant. This objective situation determines that the rectification of the commune should start with a great summary, great commendation, and great encouragement. Of course, in such two unprecedented new undertakings as the great leap forward and communization, it is inevitable that some problems will arise, but compared with the huge achievements, they are not the mainstream or the essence of things, and they are temporary. Secondly, rectifying the commune is not for the sake of rectification, but its purpose is to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of summarizing the past. Their experience of more than one month proves that wherever this objective law is followed and the method of grasping positive factors is adopted, the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's commune is vigorously carried out. The so-called grasping of positive factors means: (1) It is necessary to use the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee as a weapon to carry out extensive and in-depth socialist and communist education from the positive side. (2) It is necessary to start from summarizing the achievements of the leap forward in 1958 and the superiority of the people's commune to encourage the masses and inspire their enthusiasm to participate in the rectification of the commune. Then, on this basis, discover and solve the problems in the advancement. (3) When solving problems, we should actively discover, summarize, and promote the experience of solving these problems from the leap forward practice of the past year and from the broad masses. (4) Achievements and experiences are created by people. Therefore, while summarizing and publicizing the achievements of the leap forward and advanced experience, we must vigorously commend advanced figures with communist style and communist ideas. Even for some people with shortcomings, we should comprehensively analyze them, affirm the side of achievements, and not abandon the nine fingers and only accuse the one that is not.

### 晋北整社大抓积极因素  总结成绩  表扬先进  心情舒畅  干劲高涨

    晋北整社大抓积极因素
    总结成绩  表扬先进  心情舒畅  干劲高涨
    本报太原21日电　山西省晋北专区采取总结成绩，表扬先进，大抓积极因素的方法，进行整顿和巩固人民公社工作，取得了很大的成果。据七个县市的统计，参加整社扩干会议的一万多个县、公社和生产大队干部中，受到表扬的就有一千五百多人。又据繁峙、河曲、左云等十二个县的不完全统计，在整社中受到表扬的基层干部和社员即达九万八千多人，其中有共产党员二万多人。真是行行业业出模范，社社队队有旗帜。正因为如此，整社中就出现了一个人人心情舒畅、个个干劲高涨的新形势。广大社员从1958年看到1959年，从今天看到明天，因而积极参加了整社工作，使这一个多月的整社工作取得了重大成绩。例如朔县窑子头人民公社，在进行整顿和巩固工作的时候，一开始就注意抓积极因素，所以卷入鸣放运动的社员即占到全体社员的90％。这个公社的窑子头大队原来做法不大对头，社员鸣放不大积极，第三天改变了做法，从总结1958年的成绩和经验着手，结果社员越总结越高兴，越感到公社的可爱、越鸣放的积极。这个公社整社开始前，水利建设的出勤人数是三百人左右，而整社开始后就猛增到八百四十多人，每人每日的工作效率也提高了40％。二千五百多人的积肥大军，仅五天内就积肥七千三百多万担，从而使这个公社的基本农田，每亩平均有了肥料十三万斤。又如左云灯塔公社，原来曾因产量核不清，分配工作搞不下去。当发动社员通过大鸣大放大辩论的办法，从总结1958年的跃进成果及其伟大意义作起之后，一个群众性的核产运动随之掀起。不到半月时间，全公社六十八个村庄的分配工作就宣告结束。
    中共晋北地委十分重视，并且积极推广这方面的经验。地委负责同志说：在大跃进的1958年中，整个晋北地区真是奇迹丛生、英雄遍地，群众中的新经验、新发明、新创造不可胜计。特别是在大跃进的形势下，应运而生的人民公社，更如初升的太阳一样，威力无比，光辉四射。这种客观情况就决定了整社要从大总结，大表扬，大鼓励入手。固然，在大跃进和公社化这样两件开天辟地从来未有的新事业中，不可避免地要产生一些问题，但是和巨大的成绩比较起来，毕竟不是事物的主流，不是事物的本质，而且是暂时性的。其次整顿公社并不是为整顿而整顿，它的目的是为了在总结过去的基础上，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。他们一个多月的经验证明，凡是哪里遵照这个客观规律、采取抓积极因素的方法，哪里的整顿和巩固人民公社的工作就蓬勃开展。而所谓大抓积极因素，就是：（一）必须以八届六中全会的决议为武器，广泛而深入的从正面进行社会主义和共产主义教育。（二）必须从总结1958年的跃进成果和人民公社的优越性着手，来鼓舞群众，启发群众参加整社的积极性。然后在此基础上，发现与解决前进中的问题。（三）在解决问题的时候，应该积极地从一年来的跃进实践中，从广大群众中，去发现、总结与推广解决这些问题的经验。（四）成绩与经验都是人创造的，因此在总结与宣传跃进成果、先进经验的同时，又必须大张旗鼓地表扬具有共产主义风格和共产主义思想的先进人物。即使对于一些有缺点的人，也应全面分析，肯定成绩的一面，而不要抛开九个指头，一味指责不是。
