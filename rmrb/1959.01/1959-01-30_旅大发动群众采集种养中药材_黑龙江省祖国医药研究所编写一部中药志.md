    Lüda Mobilizes the Masses to Collect and Cultivate Chinese Medicinal Materials
    Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Compiles a Materia Medica

    (This newspaper reports) In accordance with the State Council's policy of "local production and local supply" of Chinese medicinal materials and the instruction to "systematically transform wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated and cultivated ones," the Lüda City medical and health departments have launched mass campaigns to collect, cultivate, and raise Chinese medicinal materials.

    In the past two months, employees of many medical units across the city have traversed mountains and ridges, collecting and purchasing over 1.5 million jin of wild animal and plant medicinal materials from the masses, including more than 40 types such as *Eupolyphaga sinensis*, jujube, abalone shell, *Bupleurum chinense*, *Sanguisorba officinalis*, and *Stellera chamaejasme*. Lüda City Second Hospital, Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital, Dalian Medical College Hospital, and the Shahekou District Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Clinic, among others, widely mobilized their staff and masses and collected over 37,000 jin of Chinese medicinal materials in just over 20 days. Employees of the Pharmaceutical Administration Section of the Lüda City Health Bureau, breaking the superstition that "authentic medicinal materials" cannot be transplanted to different regions, have established experimental fields for "Southern medicine moving North," and have already planted *Tussilago farfara*, peony, and chrysanthemum on over 40 mu of land. They have also planted 95 mu of safflower and over 30 mu of *Glehnia littoralis*. Once these *Glehnia littoralis* mature, they will not only meet the needs of the city but also supply a portion to other areas. The Friendship Farm in Jin County also raises scorpions in three rooms. Some varieties of Chinese medicinal materials that medical units in Lüda City previously felt were lacking can now be basically satisfied.

    The Lüda City Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the collection, cultivation, and raising of Chinese medicinal materials, and has called on all medical and health units in the city to launch a "one fen of land, one hundred jin" movement to vigorously increase the production of Chinese medicinal materials and meet the needs of medical work.

    (This newspaper reports) After three years of basic investigation into the province's abundant medicinal material resources, researchers at the Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine have recently completed a 500,000-word "Heilongjiang Materia Medica," which will be published soon.

    In the vast forests of Heilongjiang, a wide variety of valuable medicinal materials are hidden in the mountains and fields. Since 1956, the Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine has organized forces to delve into the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, Wanda Mountains, Zhangguangcai Mountains, and other mountainous areas to conduct surveys of Chinese medicinal resources. It has now found more than 500 kinds of medicinal materials, including more than 90 kinds of valuable and unutilized medicinal materials, such as ergot, *Corydalis yanhusuo*, and *Prunella vulgaris*, as well as more than 60 kinds of *Hemarthria compressa*, *Ganoderma lucidum*, and *Gymnadenia conopsea*, which have been used for a long time among the people and have remarkable curative effects.

    On the basis of a clear survey of medicinal material resources, the Heilongjiang Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, invited experienced traditional Chinese medicine masters to participate in the compilation work, absorbing their valuable experience accumulated over decades in the processing and identification of medicinal materials. At the same time, with the assistance of geological departments, medical colleges, and other related departments, the distribution of mineral medicines in the province was compiled, and the compilation of the "Heilongjiang Materia Medica" was finally completed ahead of schedule.

    旅大发动群众采集种养中药材
    黑龙江省祖国医药研究所编写一部中药志
    本报讯　旅大市医药卫生部门根据国务院关于中药材“就地生产、就地供应”的方针和“有步骤地变野生动、植物药材为家养家种”的指示，开展了群众性的采集和种、养中药材工作。
    在最近两个月的时间内，全市许多医疗单位的职工，翻山越岭采挖和向群众收购的野生动物、植物药材共一百五十多万斤，其中有全虫、酸枣、石决明、柴胡、地榆、狼毒等四十多种。旅大市立第二医院、结核病防治院、传染病医院、大连医学院医院和沙河口区中西医联合诊所等单位，由于广泛地发动了职工群众，在二十多天中就采挖了中药材三万七千多斤。旅大市卫生局药政管理处的职工，在打破了“地道药材”不能易地引种的迷信后，大搞“南药北移”的试验田，已在四十多亩土地试种了冬花、芍药和菊花；还种植了九十五亩红花和三十多亩沙参。这些沙参成熟后，不仅能满足本市的需要，还可以供应外地一部分。金县友谊农场还饲养三个房间的蝎子。过去旅大市医疗单位感到缺少的一些中药材品种，现在，已基本上能得到满足。
    中共旅大市委很重视采集和种、养中药材的工作，并号召全市各医药卫生单位开展“一分地一百斤”运动，大力增加中药材产量，满足医疗工作上的需要。
    本报讯　黑龙江省祖国医药研究所研究人员，历经三年，在对全省丰富的药材资源基本调查清楚的基础上，最近编写一部五十万字的“黑龙江中药志”，不久即可出版。
    在黑龙江辽阔的山林里，满山遍野蕴藏着各种珍贵的药材。黑龙江省祖国医药研究所从1956年起，组织力量深入大小兴安岭、完达山、张广才岭等山区，进行了中药资源的调查工作，现已找到各种药材五百余种，其中并发现了很有价值而未被利用的药材，如：麦角、元胡、夏枯草等九十余种，还有民间沿用已久，疗效卓著的血见愁羔、灵芝草和手掌参等六十余种。
    在药材资源调查清楚的基础上，黑龙江省祖国医药研究所，以土洋结合办法，邀请中药老师傅共同参加编写工作，吸收了他们几十年积累起来的中药炮炙和药材鉴别技术等宝贵经验。同时取得地质部门、医学院等有关部门协助，整理了全省矿物药的分布，终于提前完成了“黑龙江中药志”的编写工作。
