    Red Envoy Visits the Lunar Palace
    Hai Leng
    New Year brings world-shaking great news, a red rocket swiftly crossed the moon and ascended, yesterday it visited the lunar palace for the first time, sharing the joy of the human world with Chang'e to celebrate the New Year. The steeds of the era gallop day and night without stopping, the days of human interstellar travel are approaching, from now on there is no distinction between the human world and the heavens, mankind can harness nature and roam freely. The East Wind prevails over the West Wind and blows stronger and stronger, the giant waves of peace overwhelm the cries of war, who says that the lives of people in the atomic age are short? Humanity is just beginning its brilliant and splendid youth. Who says that the secrets of the second universe cannot be explored? The red envoy left its footprints on the edge of the sun. Who says the universe has authoritative gods? The most authoritative god in the universe is actually man.

    红色使者访月宫
    海稜新年传来震动世界的大喜讯，红色火箭急速地越过月球飞升，昨天它曾到月宫去作第一次访问，带着人间的欢乐和嫦娥共度新春。时代的天马在昼夜不停地飞奔，人类星际旅行的日子已经临近，从今不分人间天上，人类可以驾驭自然自由驰骋。东风压倒西风越吹越有劲，和平的巨浪盖过战争叫声，谁说原子时代人的生命短暂？人类正开始她光辉灿烂的青春。谁说第二宇宙的秘密不可探寻？红色使者在太阳边留下它的脚印。谁说宇宙有权威的神灵？宇宙最权威的神灵原来就是人。
