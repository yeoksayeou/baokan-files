The vast pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have undergone two extremely profound and extensive great social changes in the past year. After the realization of livestock farming cooperation in July last year, the people's commune movement was launched immediately afterwards. This movement began in September and October and lasted until the end of December. The original more than two thousand pastoral production cooperatives were merged and reorganized into one hundred and fifty-two people's communes. By this point, the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia had basically realized communization. The development of the movement was rapid and healthy.

The realization of people's communes in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia is a great social change of historical significance in the pastoral areas, and it is also another glorious victory of the Party's national policy. It marks a new stage in the socialist construction of the pastoral areas. The establishment of people's communes in pastoral areas is of great and far-reaching significance for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production in pastoral areas, accelerating the socialist construction of pastoral areas, realizing the technical revolution and cultural revolution in pastoral areas, and fundamentally changing the backwardness of pastoral areas. It can be asserted that after the realization of communization in pastoral areas, it will inevitably accelerate the construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, so that the Mongolian and other minority ethnic groups in pastoral areas will gradually catch up with or approach the development level of advanced ethnic groups in terms of economy and culture, and jointly build a socialist motherland.

The basic realization of communization in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia in a short period of several months is an inevitable trend in the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the result of the all-round great leap forward in various production and construction undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and also the urgent demand of the broad masses of people in the pastoral areas.

In the past year, through the rectification movement and the struggle against local nationalism in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, through the propaganda and implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and through the socialist and communist education and the widespread and in-depth development of the struggle between the two roads, the two lines, and the two work styles, the socialist and communist awareness of the people in the pastoral areas has been unprecedentedly improved. The vast majority of the masses have distinguished the major issues of right and wrong between socialism and capitalism, thereby strengthening their confidence and determination to follow the socialist road. Therefore, on the basis of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in animal husbandry production in the past few years, cooperation was realized, which laid the political and ideological foundation and material foundation for the rapid realization of communization in the pastoral areas.

Due to the fact that livestock farming cooperation fully demonstrated the superiority of collective management, the collectivist ideology of the broad masses of laboring herdsmen continued to grow, their labor enthusiasm and production enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights, greatly promoting the all-round great leap forward in animal husbandry production and various construction undertakings in the pastoral areas, and people's minds were further liberated. They deeply felt the need to further carry out large-scale construction in the pastoral areas, develop animal husbandry production at high speed, engage in diversified operations, and achieve mechanization, electrification, and industrialization as soon as possible. This requires greater exertion of collective strength and the investment of more labor. In this case, the original production relations of small cooperatives of a dozen or dozens of households in the pastoral areas are no longer adaptable.

At the same time, the unprecedented great leap forward in the people's commune movement and industrial and agricultural production in the vast rural areas across the country and the autonomous region has had an extremely profound impact on the people in the pastoral areas. The broad masses of herdsmen have an extremely urgent demand to establish people's communes. The Inner Mongolia Party Committee believes that as long as it is good at correctly stipulating the guidelines and policies for carrying out the people's commune movement in the pastoral areas based on the characteristics of the pastoral areas, strengthens leadership, fully mobilizes the masses, and realizes communization on the basis of animal husbandry cooperation, it is entirely possible and necessary.

First of all, based on the characteristics that livestock are the main means of production and also the means of livelihood in pastoral areas, that animal husbandry production is more unstable than agricultural production, and that pastoral areas are relatively scattered, and that pastoral cooperatives are mostly primary cooperatives, we adopted the policy of "prudence and stability," preventing the practice of moving a set of rural work to the pastoral areas unchanged. We have consistently adhered to the policy of gradually realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of stabilizing and developing production, as we have consistently adhered to in the past during the period of realizing cooperation in pastoral areas. In dealing with the issues of livestock joining the commune and some economic policies, we adopted a gradual approach and a variety of transitional methods. And it was especially emphasized that the spirit of the policy and specific methods should be explained clearly to the masses, and that they should have the freedom to choose based on the voluntary participation of the masses. Experience has proved that adopting this gradual approach and a variety of transitional methods to solve the problem of ownership is conducive to the development of the people's commune movement in pastoral areas and to production.

At present, the people's communes in pastoral areas generally have two situations in solving the problem of livestock ownership: one is that the livestock dividend was cancelled when the pastoral cooperative was transformed into a commune, and distribution according to labor was implemented; the other is that, which is also the majority, when livestock are transferred to the ownership of the people's commune, a certain amount of livestock dividend is still retained. The livestock dividend can be gradually abolished in the process of developing production after communization, with the increase of commune members' income and the continuous improvement of socialist and communist awareness, on the premise that it is conducive to production. This takes into account both the masses' level of awareness and the great difference in the amount of livestock occupied in pastoral areas, and is therefore conducive to production and the smooth development of the communization movement.

Secondly, in the communization movement, according to the living characteristics of herdsmen, commune members were left with the necessary riding horses, dairy cows, and mutton sheep as private livestock. Because the private livestock of herdsmen are different from the private plots of farmers, because pastoral areas are vast and transportation is inconvenient, riding horses are necessities of life; the dairy and meat eating habits of herdsmen are just like the rations needed by farmers. Not leaving dairy cows and mutton sheep will affect the lives of herdsmen. It is difficult to handle and do well to have the commune take care of all the daily dairy and meat food. Therefore, leaving a certain amount of private livestock is beneficial to both the commune and the commune members.

Third, a clear distinction must be made between means of production and means of livelihood, and different processing policies must be formulated. All means of livelihood of commune members (including houses, yurts, furniture, clothes, felt blankets, saddles, etc.) and deposits, cash, and gold and silver jewelry in banks and credit cooperatives should be clearly announced to commune members as belonging to private ownership and will always belong to private ownership.

Fourth, due to the scattered residences of pastoral areas and the vast land and sparse population, the scale of the communes is generally one Sumu (township) per commune, with an average of about five hundred households per commune. With regard to collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly in the commune, in the initial stage of commune establishment, small-scale trials should be conducted according to the characteristics of pastoral areas and local conditions, and they should not be held temporarily when conditions are not ripe.

In terms of steps, we adopted the approach of "first large and then public, first merging and then transforming, first building a frame, and at the same time organizing production," conducting socialist and communist education and education on the Party's guidelines and policies, and gradually handling economic issues on the basis of policy understanding and ideological understanding, so that people were comfortable, full of enthusiasm, and promoted production.

Although the time for the establishment of people's communes in pastoral areas is not long, it has already shown great vitality and greater superiority than the original pastoral cooperatives. First of all, it has made animal husbandry production show a new atmosphere of high-speed development. For example, the condition of livestock and livestock breeding are better than in previous years, the number of breeding improved sheep has exceeded dozens of times in previous years, and 7 billion catties of grass have been harvested, an increase of one time compared with 1957.

Secondly, the people's communes have unified the use of manpower, materials, and funds to carry out unified planning and utilization of grasslands and pastures, and to carry out large-scale basic construction in pastoral areas. In the process of communization in pastoral areas throughout the region, the work of repairing livestock sheds, opening up waterless pastures, and building feed bases has greatly increased compared with previous years.

Third, the establishment of people's communes has also promoted the all-round development of industry, agriculture, forestry, and sideline production in pastoral areas. The original single animal husbandry economy has been replaced by comprehensive production with animal husbandry as the main industry and including industry, agriculture, forestry, sideline, and fishery. Many factories for dairy products, fur, iron and wood processing, etc. have been established in various places.

Fourth, the establishment of people's communes has created favorable conditions for accelerating settlement. The devolution of state-owned farms, supply and marketing, credit, cooperative and other business departments has increased the socialist ownership by the whole people in the people's communes, and at the same time, these enterprises can be used as the center to start establishing economic centers.

Fifth, after the establishment of people's communes, national unity has been further consolidated and developed. There are many Han Chinese handicraft workers in the pastoral areas, and some Han Chinese farmers also temporarily graze in the pastoral areas and help establish feed bases. After the establishment of people's communes, they joined the communes together with the local herdsmen, which is conducive to national unity and jointly building a new socialist pastoral area.

The victorious realization of people's communes in the vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia has opened up broad prospects for the high-speed development of animal husbandry and accelerating socialist construction in pastoral areas, and has laid a solid foundation for further building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into one of the important animal husbandry bases in the country.

    内蒙古牧区发展的新阶段
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记  王铎
    在过去的一年中，内蒙古自治区辽阔广大的畜牧业区曾经历了两次极为深刻而广泛的伟大社会变革。在去年7月间实现了畜牧业合作化之后，紧接着开展人民公社化运动。这一运动从9、10月间开始，至12月末为止，原来的两千多个牧业生产合作社，经过并社改组为一百五十二个人民公社，至此，内蒙古牧区即基本上实现了公社化。运动的发展是迅速的、健康的。
    内蒙古牧区实现了人民公社化，这是牧区的一次具有历史意义的伟大社会变革，也是党的民族政策又一次光辉的胜利，它标志着牧区社会主义建设进入了一个新的阶段。牧区人民公社的建立，对于牧区畜牧业生产高速度的发展，加速牧区社会主义建设事业，实现牧区的技术革命和文化革命，从根本上改变牧区落后面貌，都具有极为重大而深远的意义。可以断言，牧区实现公社化以后，必将加速内蒙古自治区的建设，使蒙古族和牧区其他少数民族在经济文化方面逐步赶上或者接近先进民族的发展水平，共同建设社会主义的祖国。
    内蒙古牧区在短短的几个月时间基本上实现了公社化，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设形势发展的必然趋势，是内蒙古自治区各项生产建设事业全面大跃进的结果，同时也是牧区广大人民群众的迫切要求。
    一年来内蒙古牧区经过整风运动和反对地方民族主义的斗争，经过了党的社会主义建设总路线的宣传和贯彻，经过社会主义和共产主义教育和普遍深入地开展了两条道路、两条路线和两种作风的斗争，牧区人民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟空前提高，绝大多数群众都分清了社会主义与资本主义的大是大非，从而更加坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心，因而在过去几年牧业生产互助合作运动的基础上实现了合作化。这就为牧区迅速实现公社化奠定了政治思想基础和物质基础。
    由于牧业合作化充分显示了集体经营的优越性，广大劳动牧民的集体主义思想不断增长，劳动热情和生产积极性空前高涨，大大地促进了牧区畜牧业生产和各项建设事业的全面大跃进，人们的思想得到了更进一步解放，深深感到进一步大规模地进行牧区建设，高速度发展畜牧业生产，搞多种经营；早日实现机械化、电气化和工业化；这就需要更大的发挥集体力量和投入更多的劳动力，在这种情况下，牧区原有的十几户和几十户的小社生产关系已经不能适应了。
    同时，全国和自治区广大农村人民公社化运动，工农业生产上史无前例的大跃进，对牧区人民有极为深刻的影响。广大牧民建立人民公社的要求十分迫切。内蒙古党委认为只要善于根据牧区的特点，正确地规定牧区开展人民公社化运动的方针和政策，加强领导，充分发动群众，在畜牧业合作化的基础上实现公社化是完全有可能的，也是必要的。
    我们首先根据牲畜是牧区主要生产资料又是生活资料的特点，畜牧业生产比农业生产有更大的不稳定性；牧区比较分散，牧业合作社大都是初级社等情况，采取了“慎重稳妥”的方针。防止了把农村工作的一套，原封不动的搬到牧区的做法。坚持在公社化运动中仍像过去牧区实现合作化的时期，一贯坚持在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步实现对畜牧业社会主义改造的方针。对于牲畜入社和一些经济政策问题的处理上，采取了逐步前进和多种过渡办法。并且特别强调，把政策精神和具体办法向群众交代清楚，根据群众自愿，使之有选择的自由。经验证明，采取这种逐步前进和多种过渡办法，来解决所有制问题，是有利于牧区人民公社运动的发展和有利于生产的。
    目前牧区人民公社在解决牲畜所有制问题上，大体上有两种情况：一种是牧业合作社转为公社时取消了畜股报酬，实行按劳分配；另一种也是多数的，在牲畜转为人民公社所有时，还保留多少不等的畜股报酬，畜股报酬是可以在公社化后在发展生产的过程中，随着社员收入的增加和社会主义、共产主义觉悟的不断提高，在有利于生产的前提下，逐步加以取消的。这样做既照顾了群众的觉悟水平，又注意到牧区牲畜占有量的很大差别，因之是有利于生产和公社化运动的顺利发展的。
    其次，在公社化运动中，根据牧民的生活特点，给社员留下了必需的乘马、奶牛和肉食羊等自留牲畜。因为牧民的自留牲畜和农民的自留地有所不同，由于牧区辽阔，交通不便，乘用马是生活必需品；牧民的奶食和肉食习惯，就像农民需要的口粮一样，不留给奶牛和食用羊即会影响牧民生活。日常食用的奶食和肉食完全由公社包起来，一时还难以办理和办好，因之留下一定数量的自留牲畜对公社和对社员皆有好处。
    第三、对于生产资料和生活资料，必须明确的加以区分，并制订不同的处理政策。对于社员的生活资料（包括房屋、蒙古包、家具、衣服、毡子、马鞍子等）和银行、信用社的存款、现金和金银手饰等，都应向社员明确宣布，归社员私人所有，而且永远归私人所有。
    第四、由于牧区居住分散，地广人稀，在公社的规模上一般都是一苏木（乡）一社，平均每社五百户左右，关于公社的公共食堂、托儿所、敬老院等集体福利事业，在初建社阶段，应该根据牧区特点因地制宜进行小型的试办，在条件不成熟时都暂不举办。
    在步骤上采取了先大后公，先并后转，先搭架子，同时组织生产，进行社会主义与共产主义教育和党的方针政策的教育，在政策通、思想通的基础上，逐步处理经济问题、使得人心舒畅，情绪饱满，并推动了生产。
    牧区建立人民公社的时间虽然还不久，但它已经显示了巨大的生命力，比原来的牧业社有更大的优越性：首先，使畜牧业生产呈现了高速度发展的新气象，如牲畜膘情和牲畜配种都比往年好，配种改良绵羊数量超过往年十几倍，打草七十亿斤，比1957年增长一倍。
    其次，人民公社统一运用了人力物力和资金，进行草原牧场的统一规划和利用，进行牧区大规模的基本建设。全区牧区在公社化的过程中，修盖畜棚、开辟无水草场和饲料基地的工作比往年大有增加。
    第三，人民公社的建立，也促进了牧区工、农、林和副业生产全面大发展。原来单一的畜牧业经济已为以牧为主工、农、林、副、渔全面生产所代替。各地已办起了不少的乳品、皮毛、铁木加工等工厂。
    第四，人民公社的建立，为加速定居创造了有利条件。国营牧场、供销、信用、合作等企业部门的下放增加了人民公社化全民所有制的成分，同时又可以这些企业为中心，开始建立起经济中心点。
    第五、人民公社建立后，民族团结更进一步巩固和发展了。牧区有不少汉族手工业工人，也有些汉族农民在牧区作临时放牧和帮助建立饲料基地。建立人民公社后，他们和当地牧民一起入了公社，有利于民族团结，和共同建设社会主义的新牧区。
    内蒙古广大牧区胜利实现了人民公社化，为高速度的发展畜牧业，加速牧区社会主义建设开辟了广阔的道路，为进一步把内蒙古自治区建设成为全国重要的畜牧业基地之一奠定了有力的基础。
