Kicking Football with a Steel Helmet
Yuè Jūn

Who ever heard of wearing a steel helmet to play football? It happens. It happened in the United States. "Cleveland dispatch: According to a report by the U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association, seventeen American youths died last fall from injuries sustained while playing the rough game of American football—rugby. The association said that although each athlete is equipped with thick body armor and a steel helmet when playing this game, accidents are still unavoidable. Since 1947, 81.5% of deaths have been caused by head injuries. The association recommends further improving the steel helmet and manufacturing a more durable steel helmet." (Xinhua News Agency, January 11)

The enemy is rotting away, which is not only manifested in the deepening political and economic crises and the intensification of internal contradictions within the entire imperialist camp, but also in sports, where we can see the decay of their social system.

Originally, the purpose of sports was to enhance people's physical fitness and cultivate noble qualities of resourcefulness, courage, and cooperation; sports competitions were also solely for demonstrating mutual skills for the purpose of mutual learning, and it should have been of a friendly nature. However, in the capitalist world, sports are controlled by capitalists and have become a tool for them to get rich. These capitalists cruelly exploit the athletes, and the athletes, in order to maintain their lives and receive more favors from the bosses, resort to various means to achieve victory. Many athletes are injured or even die in such situations. According to the American Football Association's disclosure last year, in the past twenty years, an average of twenty-six people have died each football season from playing this sport.

Are athletes inherently combative? No! Behind the beastly struggles of bourgeois athletes, we see the cannibalistic essence of capitalist society. Joe Louis, the American boxing champion who won the world heavyweight title, announced his retirement in 1949, but the U.S. government pursued him for back taxes. Later, the old debt was not cleared, and the new debt accumulated interest upon interest, reaching $1.25 million. Louis, who was nearly forty years old, had to return to the ring. In 1951, he was finally knocked down by his opponent, ending his boxing career; however, in order to live and pay off the taxes that would take him more than sixty years to clear, he had to become a wrestler, and often took to the stage while ill. When the famous American boxer Lohah was ill, his agent threatened to terminate the contract if he did not continue to compete. Fearing unemployment, he had no choice but to compete, and as a result, he died in the ring.

The bourgeoisie "accumulated mountains of wealth, but turned people into slaves of these wealth." (Lenin: "Civilized Barbarism") The merchants of bourgeois sports cruelly exploit sports athletes, and from the athletes' bodies, they increase their already accumulated mountains of wealth. And many athletes, for the sake of money, become desperados under exploitation. The noble purpose of sports and the moral qualities of sports have been completely thrown to the winds for these "slaves of wealth." They either kill others or are killed by others, or after their youth, end up in poverty. Capitalist society is such a society full of the struggle of the rich and the poor, and the survival of the fittest. Money and profit are the decisive forces in sports in capitalist countries; buying and selling is the essence of bourgeois sports.

From sports, we can also see the decay of capitalist society in its final stage—the stage of imperialism. This system is bound to rot away. Although the Dulleses of this world desperately expand armaments and pursue a "brink of war" policy, it is no different from the U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association's suggestion to further improve steel helmets and manufacture more durable steel helmets, what fundamental problem can it solve!

    戴着钢盔踢足球
    岳军
    谁听说过踢足球要戴钢盔？有。这事就出在美国。“克利夫兰消息：据美国全国大学体育联合会报告，去年秋季有十七名美国青年在玩动作粗野的美国式足球——橄榄球比赛中受伤死亡。这个联合会说，虽然举行这种球赛时每个运动员全身装备着各种厚厚的护身甲并且戴着钢盔，但是仍不免发生事故。1947年以来81.5％的死亡事故是由于撞击头部而造成的。联合会建议再改进钢盔，制造更坚硬的钢盔。”（新华社1月11日讯）
    敌人在烂下去，不仅表现在整个帝国主义阵营的政治和经济危机的加深和内部矛盾的加剧上面，而且在体育上面，也可以看到他们的社会制度在烂下去。
    本来，体育的目的是为了增强人们的体质，培养人们机智、勇敢和合作的高尚品德的；体育比赛，也仅仅为了表现双方技巧，以便互相学习，它本来应该是友谊性质的。然而，在资本主义世界，体育运动为资本家所控制，成为他们发财致富的工具。这些资本家对运动员进行残酷的剥削，而运动员们为了维持生活和从老板那里得到较多的赐予，就采取各种手段取得胜利。多少运动员在这样的场合受伤甚至死亡。据美国橄榄球联合会去年透露，在过去二十多年中，每一个橄榄球季，由于打这种球而受伤致死的人平均达二十六人。
    是运动员们本性好斗吗？不！在资产阶级运动员野兽般的搏斗后面，我们看到资本主义社会吃人的本质。曾获重量级世界冠军的美国拳王乔·路易斯，1949年他宣布退休了，但美国政府向他追收捐税。以后旧债未清，新债利上滚利，竟达一百二十五万美元。已经快四十岁的路易斯只得重新登台。1951年，终于被对手击倒，结束了拳击生涯；可是，为了生活，为了还清需要他再活六十多年才能还清的税款，他仍不得不当摔跤手，而且常常是抱病登台。美国著名拳击家罗哈，在抱病时，他的经纪人以废除合同来威胁他，要他继续出场比赛，他害怕失业，不得不出场，结果就死在拳击场上。
    资产阶级“积聚了堆积如山的财富，但又把人变成了这些财富的奴隶。”（列宁：“文明的野蛮”）资产阶级体育运动的商人们，残酷地剥削着体育运动员，从体育运动员们的身上，又加高了他们原已堆积如山的财富。而很多体育运动员们，为了金钱，在被人剥削的情况下，一个个成了亡命之徒。什么体育运动的高尚目的，什么体育运动的道德品质，对于这些“财富的奴隶”，已经全抛到九霄云外了。他们或者去击毙别人，或者被别人击毙，或者在青春过后，落得个贫困潦倒。资本主义社会，就是这样一个充满着你穷我富、你死我活的斗争的。金钱、利润，这就是资本主义国家体育运动的决定力量；买卖，这就是资产阶级体育运动的本质。
    从体育运动，我们也可以看到资本主义社会发展到最后阶段——帝国主义阶段时的腐朽性。这种制度一定要烂下去。尽管杜勒斯之流拼命扩充军备、推行“战争边缘”政策，也不过像美国全国大学体育联合会建议再改进钢盔、制造更坚硬的钢盔一样，又能解决什么根本问题呢！（附图片）
