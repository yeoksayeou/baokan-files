    World's Only Non-Magnetic Research Vessel
    Soviet "Zarya" Returns Home in Triumph
    Xinhua News Agency, January 10th -- TASS Leningrad, January 8th dispatch: The world's only non-magnetic research vessel, the Soviet "Zarya," has returned to the Soviet Union in triumph. Based on the results of this expedition, the basic laws governing the distribution of geomagnetic anomalies in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans will be precisely determined for the first time.
    This three-masted schooner-rigged motor vessel spent fifteen months on this ocean voyage, covering a distance of 47,000 miles.
    The expedition leader, Ivanov, announced to TASS reporters that the recording of geomagnetic elements never ceased during the entire voyage, and the length of the recording tape used by the automatic recorders reached about ten kilometers.
    Ivanov said that the observations showed that all coastal areas are quiet magnetic field areas, and the farther away from the coast, the stronger the magnetic field becomes. When the research vessel crossed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Whale Ridge, and other places, it was determined that these areas had significant geomagnetic anomalies. According to Soviet scientists, these geomagnetic anomalies are precisely distributed along these submarine mountain ranges.
    Ivanov finally said that the results of the research based on the materials from this expedition will necessitate some modifications to geomagnetic maps and nautical charts.

    世界唯一的非磁性考察船
    苏联“曙光号”凯旋回国
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒8日消息：世界上唯一的一艘非磁性考察船，苏联的“曙光号”已经胜利返回苏联。根据这次考察结果将第一次精确地确定大西洋、印度洋上地磁异常现象的分布的基本规律。
    这艘三桅纵帆式机动船这次海洋航行历时十五个月，航程四万七千英里。
    考察队队长伊凡诺夫对塔斯社记者宣布说，这次在整个的航程中地磁要项的记录工作从未间断过，自动记录机所用的记录带的长度达到十公里左右。
    伊凡诺夫说，观察的结果证明，所有的沿岸地区都是宁静磁场地区，离海岸越远，磁场强度就越加强。当考察船越过大西洋海底山脉、鲸海底山脉等地的时候，确定了这些区域有重要的地磁异常现象。据苏联科学家的意见，这种地磁异常正是分布在沿着这些海底山脉的区域。
    伊凡诺夫最后说，根据这次考察材料进行研究的结果，将会使地磁图和航海地图作若干必要的修改。
