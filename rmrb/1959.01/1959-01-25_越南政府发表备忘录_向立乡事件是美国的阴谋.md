Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 24th. Le Loc, Director of the Asian-African Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced at a press conference today the memorandum of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the invasion of the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Xiang Li Township by the army of the Kingdom of Laos.

The "Memorandum" lists a large number of conclusive historical materials proving that Xiang Li Township has been the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam since ancient times, and the regime in Xiang Li Township has always belonged to Vietnam and not to Laos.

The "Memorandum" points out that since 1956, the army of the Kingdom of Laos has repeatedly invaded the border of Vietnam in Xiang Li Township and carried out provocative activities in this area. By November 1958, the above-mentioned invasions and provocations became more frequent and expanded.

The "Memorandum" states that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly written to the Lao authorities, clearly pointing out that the above-mentioned acts are acts of invading the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and demanding that the dispute be resolved through consultation, but all have been rejected by the Lao authorities.

The "Memorandum" points out that the provocative incidents in the Xiang Li area are not accidental, but are part of a conspiracy by US imperialism. The "Memorandum" lists a large amount of material proving that US imperialism is increasingly deeply interfering in the internal affairs of Laos. At the same time, US imperialism also instigated reactionary elements in the government of the Kingdom of Laos to suppress former resistance personnel and the Lao Patriotic Party. Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone also used the so-called "serious situation" on the border as an excuse to ask the National Assembly to grant twelve months of privileges to "reorganize the government" and "amend the constitution," in an attempt to establish a dictatorial government.

The "Memorandum" points out that all of this makes it easy to see that the Xiang Li provocation incident is clearly a prepared and planned conspiracy. Its purpose is to attempt to create tension on the border between Vietnam and Laos, alienate the two ethnic groups, find an excuse to suppress the domestic people, and attempt to take the opportunity to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    越南政府发表备忘录
    向立乡事件是美国的阴谋
    新华社河内24日电　越南外交部亚非司司长黎禄今天在记者招待会上宣布了越南民主共和国政府关于老挝王国军队在向立乡侵犯越南民主共和国边界的问题的备忘录。
    “备忘录”列举大量确凿的历史材料证明，向立乡自古以来就是越南民主共和国的领土，向立乡的政权一向属于越南而不属于老挝。
    “备忘录”指出，从1956年起，老挝王国军队就曾经多次侵犯了越南边界的向立乡和在这个地区进行挑衅活动，到了1958年11月，上述侵犯和挑衅行为更加频繁和扩大。
    “备忘录”说，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次函告老挝当局，明确指出上述行为是侵犯越南民主共和国领土的行为，并且要求通过协商来解决争端，但都遭受老挝当局的拒绝。
    “备忘录”指出，向立地区的挑衅事件不是偶然的，它是美帝国主义的阴谋的一部分。“备忘录”列举的大量材料证明，美帝国主义越来越深入地干涉老挝的内政。与此同时，美帝国主义还唆使老挝王国政府中的反动分子压迫前抗战人员和老挝爱国党，老挝首相培·萨纳尼空还以所谓边境“局势严重”为借口，要求国民议会给予十二个月的特权来“改组政府”和“修改宪法”，企图建立一个独裁政府。
    “备忘录”指出，所有这些不难令人看出，向立的挑衅事件显然是有准备有计划的阴谋。其目的是企图在越南、老挝边境制造紧张局势，离间两个民族，为镇压国内人民找借口，并企图乘机把老挝拉入东南亚军事集团。
    “备忘录”说：“越南民主共和国的立场始终是同老挝王国在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展友好关系。”“越南民主共和国政府要求老挝王国军队终止对越南民主共和国领空、领土的侵犯行为，并且以和平协商办法来解决双方争端。”
