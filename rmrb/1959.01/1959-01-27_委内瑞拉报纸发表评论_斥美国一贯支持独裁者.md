Xinhua News Agency, January 26th, Caracas dispatch: The Venezuelan newspaper "El Universal" recently published a commentary on Milton Eisenhower's report to the US President regarding Latin American issues.

    The newspaper stated that Milton Eisenhower views the Latin American conviction that the United States is always ready to support dictatorial regimes as a "misunderstanding," but that the United States has, until now, maintained a supportive attitude towards dictators. "There is countless evidence on this continent to prove this." The newspaper also pointed out that the US attitude in the Organization of American States has consistently disregarded the democratic conditions in the organization's charter. The United States has, without exception, encouraged private enterprises and companies to take direct action, and these enterprises and companies, "relying on the sympathy of the White House," openly and fully support "all dictators."

    委内瑞拉报纸发表评论
    斥美国一贯支持独裁者
    新华社26日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉“宇宙报”最近就密尔顿·艾森豪威尔向美国总统提出的拉丁美洲问题报告发表了评论。
    这家报纸说，密尔顿·艾森豪威尔把拉丁美洲深信美国随时支持独裁政权这一点看作是“误解”，但是美国到现在为止对独裁者就是抱着支持的态度。“在这块大陆上有无数证据可以证明这一点”。这家报纸还指出，美国在美洲国家组织中的态度一直是无视该组织宪章中的民主条件。美国毫无例外地鼓励私营企业和公司采取直接行动，这些企业和公司便“仗着白宫的同情”公开地全力支持“所有的独裁者”。
