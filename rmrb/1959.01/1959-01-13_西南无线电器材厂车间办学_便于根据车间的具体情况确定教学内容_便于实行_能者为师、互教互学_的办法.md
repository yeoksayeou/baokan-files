    Southwest Radio Factory Runs Schools in Workshops
    Facilitates Determining Teaching Content Based on Specific Workshop Conditions
    Facilitates Implementing the Method of "Those Who Can Teach, Teach Each Other and Learn from Each Other"
    (Our Dispatch) Chengdu – The Southwest Radio Factory in Chengdu has paid attention to implementing the mass line in running schools, and has achieved good results. From July to the end of September last year, the factory ran schools through the factory management, and although it achieved considerable results, the number of enrolled students accounted for only about 7% of the total number of employees due to problems such as learning time being difficult to solve. In October, after the factory delegated some of the school-running power to the workshops and departments, the number of schools run by the factory increased from three to twenty-one in just two months, and the number of enrolled students immediately rose to 65%. Moreover, the masses themselves solved problems such as teachers, teaching materials, and teaching time. These schools included literacy classes, primary schools, junior high schools, technical schools, and intermediate technical schools.
    The Southwest Radio Factory is a new factory, and 70% of its employees are young workers. During the Great Leap Forward, they put forward many suggestions for improving production, but because they could not draw, calculate, or understand the properties of materials, they were often difficult to implement. In order to rapidly improve the technical level of the workers, the factory management opened a half-work, half-study university and two spare-time technical schools in July last year. However, due to restrictions such as teachers and learning time, only more than 500 people enrolled, which was far from meeting the needs of the masses.
    After studying these situations, the factory Party committee decided to make a major reform of the factory's school-running work in accordance with the Party's educational policy. Then, a great debate was launched throughout the factory. After the debate, everyone generally realized that not only can the factory management run schools, but workshops can also run schools. First, workshop-run schools can easily connect with the students' ideological reality, so that politics, culture, and technology can be better combined. Second, it is convenient to determine teaching content according to specific circumstances and use workshop equipment for on-site teaching; the method of "those who can teach, teach each other and learn from each other" is easy to implement, and the problem of teachers is easy to solve. Finally, learning time can be flexibly arranged according to the workshop's production and workers' living conditions, and various learning forms can be adopted to make learning more guaranteed.
    While the debate was unfolding, the workshops began to prepare for running schools. They posted enrollment brochures in the workshops and hired teachers. For example, after breaking down ideological obstacles such as the workshop not having experts and professors, being afraid of affecting production, and difficulty in arranging labor, the Sixth Workshop immediately established three spare-time schools of varying levels. The number of enrolled workers increased from the past eighteen to more than three hundred. In the past, some workers in the Thirteenth Workshop had to travel more than ten miles to the factory to attend classes and were unwilling to participate in learning; now, they have set up three schools themselves, and all 210 people in the workshop have enrolled.
    After the workshops ran schools, the problem of teachers was also solved. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the workshops hired more than 140 teachers in accordance with the principle of "those who can teach, teach each other and learn from each other." In addition to workshop directors, technicians, and section chiefs, there were also eighteen worker teachers. In the past, when some workers in this workshop encountered small problems with the machine switches, they often stopped the machine and waited for an electrician to repair it; now, after learning electrical knowledge, they can repair it themselves. In the past, the Sixth Workshop often encountered some difficult problems in production, such as the produced insulators not being tightly sealed, and they had to rely on experience to solve them. Through the study of process courses, the workers analyzed the reasons for the unsealed condition from a theoretical point of view and conducted a series of studies on welding temperature, solder, etc., which greatly reduced the number of defective products.
    Now, this factory is summarizing the experience of running schools in workshops. The factory Party committee is also assisting the workshops in arranging learning time and adding teaching content, striving to enable the vast majority of employees to learn the knowledge they urgently need.

### 西南无线电器材厂车间办学  便于根据车间的具体情况确定教学内容  便于实行“能者为师、互教互学”的办法

    西南无线电器材厂车间办学
    便于根据车间的具体情况确定教学内容
    便于实行“能者为师、互教互学”的办法
    本报讯　成都西南无线电器材厂在办学中，注意了贯彻群众路线，收到了良好的效果。从去年7月到9月底，这个厂由厂部办学，虽说也取得了不小成绩，但由于学习时间等问题不易解决，入学人数只占职工总数7％左右。10月份，该厂把部分办学权力下放给车间、科室后，在短短两个月的时间内，全厂开办的学校，就由三所增加到二十一所，入学人数立刻上升到65％。而且，由群众自己解决了教师、教材、教学时间等问题。这些学校，包括扫盲班、小学、初中、技工学校、中级技术学校。
    西南无线电器材厂是一个新厂，70％都是青年工人。在大跃进中，他们提出了许多改进生产的建议，但由于不会绘图，不会计算，不懂材料的性能，往往不容易实现。为了迅速提高工人的技术水平，厂部便在去年7月开办了一所半工半读大学、两所业余技工学校。但因教师、学习时间等限制，只有五百多人入学。远远不能满足群众的要求。
    工厂党委研究了这些情况后，决定按照党的教育方针，对工厂办学工作来个大改革。接着，便在全厂展开了一个大辩论。经过辩论，大家普遍认识到：不仅厂部可以办学，车间也可以办学。首先，车间办学容易联系学生的思想实际，使政治、文化、技术结合得更好。其次，便于根据具体情况来确定教学内容，利用车间设备进行现场教学；“能者为师，互教互学”的办法，易于贯彻执行，教员问题容易解决。最后，可以根据车间的生产和工人生活情况，灵活安排学习时间，采用多种学习形式，使学习更有保障。
    与展开辩论的同时，各车间就着手进行办学筹备工作。他们在车间内贴出了招生简章，并聘请了教师。如第六车间在打破了车间没有专家教授、怕影响生产、劳动不好安排等思想障碍后，立刻创办了不同程度的三所业余学校。入学的工人由过去的十八人，增加到三百多人。过去，第十三车间有的工人要走十几里路到工厂上课，全不愿参加学习；现在，他们自己办起了三所学校，车间二百一十人全部报名入学。
    车间办学以后，教师问题也得到了解决。各车间在党支部领导下，根据“能者为师、互教互学”的方针，一共聘请到一百四十多名教员。其中除了车间主任、技术员、工段长外，还有十八名工人教员。过去，这个车间的一些工人，遇到机器开关发生小毛病时，往往停车等电工来修理；现在，他们学了电工常识后，自己就能修理。六车间以往在生产上经常遇到一些难题，如生产的绝缘子密封不牢等，只好凭经验解决。通过工艺课程的学习，工人们从理论上分析了不密封的原因，对焊接温度、焊料等进行了一系列的研究，使废品大大减少。
    现在，这个厂正在总结车间办学的经验。厂党委也在协助各车间安排学习时间，增设教学内容，力争使绝大多数职工都能学到他们迫切需要的知识。　　（范　眭）（附图片）
