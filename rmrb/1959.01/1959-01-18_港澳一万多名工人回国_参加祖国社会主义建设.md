Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 17th: In the past six months, nearly ten thousand workers from Hong Kong and Macau have returned to Guangdong Province to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　The vast majority of these workers are skilled workers in industries such as mechanical and electrical engineering, transportation, and construction. Most of them possess technical skills equivalent to fifth or sixth-grade technicians or second or third-grade drivers. There are also some experienced masters and foremen. Currently, except for the batch of workers who returned to Guangzhou in January and are awaiting job assignments, over nine thousand four hundred earlier arrivals have been placed in Guangzhou, Shaoguan, and emerging industrial and mining enterprises within the province.

　　These workers, who have returned to the mainland to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, are inspired by the vigorous development of the national construction cause. Upon arriving at their new posts, they immediately engaged in enthusiastic labor alongside local workers. According to preliminary statistics from Guangzhou and Zhanjiang, nearly half of the workers who returned from Hong Kong and Macau and are working in shipbuilding, electrical machinery, chemical, tractor, and automobile repair factories have been recognized as advanced producers or received various awards due to their active production or technological innovation. Some workers have also been promoted to positions such as production team leaders and section chiefs.

　　The vast majority of the workers who returned from Hong Kong and Macau can unite with the workers in their respective units, fostering friendship and harmonious relationships. The more than one hundred and seventy workers assigned to work at the Guangzhou General Station of the Provincial Transportation Bureau often talk about the care and assistance they receive from the station's leaders and workers. The workers at the station also praise their willingness to learn humbly and work diligently. Many drivers and repairmen, who faced various unreasonable restrictions in Hong Kong and Macau and did not master comprehensive skills, are being assisted by the workers at the station in learning new techniques, which has further stimulated their enthusiasm for labor.

　　These Hong Kong and Macau workers mainly yearn for the great leap forward in the construction of the motherland and are attracted and inspired by a happy life. After returning to Guangzhou, they have been welcomed and cared for by the Party, the government, and relevant departments.

    港澳一万多名工人回国
    参加祖国社会主义建设
    据新华社广州17日电　半年来，香港和澳门有近一万名工人回到广东省参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    这些工人绝大部分是机电、交通和建筑等行业的技术工人，大多数工人有相当于五、六级技工或二、三级司机的技术水平，还有一些是老师傅和管工等。现在，除1月份回到广州的一批工人正在等待分配工作外，先来的九千四百多人已分别安置在广州、韶关和省内新兴的工矿企业中工作。
    这些回到内地参加祖国社会主义建设的工人们，受到国家建设事业蓬勃发展的鼓舞，一到新的工作岗位就和当地工人一道进行热火朝天的劳动。据广州和湛江市的初步统计，在造船、电机、化工、拖拉机厂和汽车修理厂工作的从港、澳回来的工人中，将近一半的人由于生产积极或技术上有革新创造，而被评为先进生产者或获得各种奖励。一部分工人还被提拔担任生产组长、工段长等职务。
    从港澳回来的工人们绝大多数能和所在单位的工人团结友爱融洽相处。被分配在省运输局广州总站工作的一百七十多个工人，经常谈到站里领导人员和工人们对他们的关怀和帮助，站里的工人也赞扬他们能虚心学习和劳动好。许多司机和修理工人在港、澳由于受到各种不合理限制，掌握的技术不够全面，站里的工人们就帮助他们学习新的技术，更激发了他们的劳动热情。
    这些港、澳工人主要是向往祖国建设事业的大跃进，受到幸福生活的吸引、鼓舞而回到广东内地的。他们回到广州后，受到了党、政府和各有关部门的欢迎和关怀。
