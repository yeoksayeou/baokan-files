Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 11th: The Soviet government submitted the draft of the German peace treaty it proposed and corresponding notes to the governments of Belgium and other countries that participated in the war against Germany with armed forces on the 10th.

In the note to the Belgian government, the Soviet government pointed out that the Soviet government's starting point in proposing the draft of the German peace treaty is that the attitudes of all parties concerned on the German issue have been completely determined, and now it is necessary to abandon unnecessary disputes and make practical decisions based on the status quo of Germany and the interests of consolidating European peace.

The note pointed out that concluding a German peace treaty at the present time is a measure that can enable the German people to resolve their main national task – restoring national unity – as soon as possible.

The note pointed out that concluding a treaty in line with the interests of Germany's peaceful development will create the necessary conditions to forever prevent the recurrence of past tragedies, in which German militarists dragged mankind into devastating wars with enormous losses of human and material resources.

The note stated that the Soviet government hopes to peacefully resolve the German issue on a practical basis, and therefore it submits a draft treaty prepared for the Belgian government's study.

The Soviet government suggested that a peace conference be held in Warsaw or Prague within two months to discuss the draft of the German peace treaty and to formulate and conclude a mutually agreed German peace treaty.

    苏联就对德和约问题照会比利时等国
    签订对德和约促进德国统一
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府10日把它提出的对德和约草案和相应的照会分别交给比利时政府和其他有武装部队参加对德战争的国家的政府。
    苏联政府在给比利时政府的照会中指出，苏联政府提出对德和约草案的出发点是：有关各方在德国问题上的态度已经完全确定，现在必须抛开不必要的争论，根据德国的现状和巩固欧洲和平的利益作出实际的决定。
    照会中指出，在目前签订对德和约，正是一个能使德国人民尽速解决他们全民族的主要任务——恢复国家统一的措施。
    照会中指出，签订符合德国和平发展利益的和约会创造必要的条件，以永远防止过去悲剧的重演，过去德国军国主义者曾把人类拖进人力和物力遭到巨大损失的毁灭性战争中去。
    照会中说，苏联政府希望在实际的基础上和平解决德国问题，因此它把拟就的一份和约草案提交比利时政府研究。
    苏联政府建议在两个月内在华沙或布拉格召开和平会议，来讨论对德和约草案，并且拟定和签订经过大家同意的对德和约。
