Grasping the "Three Interlocking Rings"

Adopting diverse methods to facilitate the masses in offering opinions is a noteworthy practice in the rectification of communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou.

Cadres being willing to listen to the opinions of the masses is the fundamental condition for mobilizing the masses to speak out freely; however, this alone, without corresponding organizational work, often fails to achieve the goal of enabling the masses to express themselves without reservation.

The experience of the rectification of communes in the pilot area of Hangzhou suburbs tells us that cadres having the determination to listen to the opinions of the masses, dispelling their ideological concerns about offering opinions, and providing ample convenience for them to do so, are three interconnected links in fully mobilizing the masses to speak out freely. May every commune cadre firmly grasp this "three interlocking rings" in the commune rectification movement.

    抓住“三连环”
    采用多种多样方法给群众提意见以方便，是杭州郊区整社工作中的一个值得提出来的一个作法。
    干部愿意听取群众的意见，这是发动群众鸣放的基本条件；但是，仅此一点，而没有相应的组织工作，往往不能达到使群众畅所欲言的目的。
    杭州郊区整社试点经验告诉我们：干部有决心听取群众意见，解除群众提意见的思想顾虑和给群众提意见以充分便利，是充分发动群众鸣放的三个连结在一起的环节。愿每个公社干部在整社运动中紧紧抓住这个“三连环”。
