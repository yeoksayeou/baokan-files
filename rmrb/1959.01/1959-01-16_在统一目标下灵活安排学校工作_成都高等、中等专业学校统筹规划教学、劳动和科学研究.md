    Flexible Arrangement of School Work Under Unified Goals
    Chengdu Higher and Secondary Vocational Schools Plan Teaching, Labor, and Scientific Research in a Coordinated Manner
    (Our newspaper reports) To thoroughly change the situation in which schools lacked practical labor and education was divorced from productive labor, and to prevent schools from having too much productive labor and affecting teaching and scientific research, Chengdu organized a large-scale collaboration among all universities and secondary vocational schools in the city. With teaching as the center, various schools planned their productive labor and scientific research tasks in a coordinated manner, so that each school could properly and comprehensively arrange teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, and promote the close integration of these three aspects of work, achieving comprehensive leap forward.
    This coordinated arrangement work was carried out under the leadership of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The purpose of the arrangement is, on the one hand, to thoroughly change the situation in which schools lacked practical labor and education was divorced from productive labor; on the other hand, also to prevent schools from having too much productive labor, which affected teaching and scientific research work. In November last year, the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held several meetings of leading cadres of various schools to discuss this issue. According to the different situations of each school, it was decided to arrange according to the "one, two, nine" (one month vacation, two months labor, nine months of study), "one, three, eight" or "one, four, seven" system. In order to effectively implement this system, all universities and secondary vocational schools in Chengdu mobilized the masses, took the school and department as units, discussed and formulated specific plans for the combination of teaching, productive labor and scientific research at all levels, comprehensively arranged study, labor and rest time, and also carried out a series of reforms to teaching content and teaching methods. In order to make labor and scientific research work proceed in a planned manner around teaching, the general arrangement method of schools is: science and engineering students participate in various productive labor combined with their majors; arts and history students participate in general productive labor; senior students of science and engineering departments participate in productive labor combined with their majors; and junior students participate in general productive labor. For example, after Sichuan University arranged according to the needs of teaching and scientific research in various majors, each department also adopted methods such as on-site teaching to more closely integrate teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. The physics department generally no longer offers separate experimental classes, and the experimental classes are decentralized to professional factories; the inorganic analysis class for freshmen in the chemistry department uses the analysis and determination of brine, steel, and refractory materials provided by production units to replace the past hypothetical analysis. After such arrangements, taking the chemistry department of science and the Chinese department of arts as examples, teachers and students, in addition to two months of concentrated time to go to the countryside and factories to participate in labor, usually have one day of political study, four days of professional study, one day of labor, and one day of rest every week; and there is also appropriate time for physical exercise and recreational activities every day.
    When various schools formulated the arrangement plan, the Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized large-scale cooperation among all universities and secondary vocational schools in the city in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive leap forward, coordinated arrangement, combination of majors, emphasis on different aspects, unified plan, and separate contracting," and uniformly distributed various production and scientific research tasks given by the state this year, so that each school could take the initiative and properly conduct a comprehensive arrangement of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research around teaching work.
    When distributing production and scientific research tasks according to this principle, Chengdu's specific approach is: first, after comprehensively considering the development conditions of teaching, production, and scientific research in various schools, the Municipal Party Committee distributes certain production and scientific research tasks to each school according to the city's plan. These tasks include steel, machinery production, school-run factories, and other aspects. For example, the production of iron, steel, and machinery this year is mainly distributed to metallurgical schools and industrial schools with machinery factories, as well as nine schools with a large number of people who need and can undertake this task; some schools do not directly participate in the production of iron, steel, and machinery, but undertake the production of raw materials needed for the production of iron, steel, and machinery, such as coke, refractory materials, ferrosilicon, calcium carbide, soda ash, and so on; and schools that undertake heavier scientific research tasks are not arranged for the production of iron, steel, machinery, and related raw materials. In this way, a large-scale cooperation system is formed in the aspects of iron, steel, and machinery in various schools. In terms of school-run factories, all schools pay attention to combining with their majors as much as possible, and adopt the simultaneous approach of large, medium, and small, that is, three forms: local investment and school contracting, joint venture with relevant business departments, and self-run by the school; the production of these factories is also arranged with both fixed batch production and temporary small-volume trial production. However, the factories run by schools cannot meet all the needs of teaching and scientific research, and the labor of teachers and students cannot be limited to the campus, ignoring the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, so attention is also paid to the overall arrangement of on-campus labor and off-campus labor. Another issue is that voluntary labor must be approved by an agency to avoid multiple arrangements, affecting the teaching plan and disrupting the overall arrangement. At present, the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Municipal Education Bureau appropriately control the participation of universities and secondary vocational schools in Chengdu in voluntary labor.
    At the same time, various schools have also preliminarily determined the development focus of production and scientific research according to the nature of the school, the characteristics of the major, and the needs of teaching. When the city coordinates the above tasks, it fully considers the different situations of various schools and emphasizes different aspects so that various schools can more closely integrate teaching, productive labor, and scientific research.
    After such a layer-by-layer coordinated arrangement at the city, school, and department levels, the teaching, productive labor, and scientific research of universities and secondary vocational schools in Chengdu have now begun to develop normally. (Zhou Zuyou)

    在统一目标下灵活安排学校工作
    成都高等、中等专业学校统筹规划教学、劳动和科学研究
    本报讯　成都市在全市高等学校和中等专业学校中组织大协作，各学校以教学工作为中心，统筹规划各种生产劳动和科学研究任务，使各学校得以妥善全面地安排教学、生产劳动和科学研究，促进这三方面工作紧密结合，全面跃进。
    这次统筹安排工作是在中共成都市委领导下进行的。安排的目的，一方面是为了彻底改变过去学校缺乏劳动实践，使教育与生产劳动脱节的情况；另一方面也为了防止学校中生产劳动过多，影响教学和科学研究工作。去年11月份，中共成都市委宣传部曾召开几次各校领导干部会议，讨论这一问题，根据各校不同情况，决定分别按“一、二、九”（一个月放假，两个月劳动，九个月学习）、“一、三、八”或“一、四、七”的制度进行安排。为了切实执行这一制度，成都市各高等学校和中等专业学校都发动群众，以校和系为单位，层层讨论制订了教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的具体方案，全面安排了学习、劳动和休息时间，对教学内容和教学方法也进行了一系列的改革。为了使劳动和科学研究工作都围绕教学有计划地进行，一般学校的安排办法是：理、工科学生多参加结合专业的各种生产劳动；文、史科多参加一般性生产劳动；理、工科各系高年级学生多参加结合专业的生产劳动；低年级多参加一般性生产劳动。如四川大学根据各专业教学和科学研究的需要安排后，各系还采取现场教学等办法，把教学、生产劳动与科学研究更紧密地结合起来。物理系一般不再单独开实验课，把实验课下放到专业工厂中进行；化学系一年级的无机分析课，用生产单位提出的卤水、钢铁、耐火材料的分析测定，代替过去假想式的分析。经过这样安排，以理科的化学、文科的中文等系为例，师生除一年有两个月集中下乡下厂参加劳动的时间外，平常每周有一天政治学习，四天专业学习，一天劳动和一天休息；每天还有适当的体育锻炼和文娱活动时间。
    在各校制订安排方案时，中共成都市委宣传部按照“全面跃进、统筹安排、结合专业、各有侧重、统一计划、分别包干”的原则，在全市高等学校和中等专业学校中组织大协作，统一分配了今年国家给予的各项生产和科学研究任务，以便各校围绕教学工作，主动而妥善地对教学、生产劳动和科学研究进行全面安排。
    在根据这一原则分配生产和科学研究任务时，成都市的具体作法是：首先，在全面考虑各学校教学、生产和科学研究的发展条件后，由市委按全市计划，给各学校分配一定的生产和科学研究任务。这些任务包括钢铁、机械生产、校办工厂等各方面。例如今年铁钢、机械的生产，主要分配给冶金学校和有机械工厂的工业性质学校，以及人数较多需要并可能担负这项任务的共九所学校；有些学校不直接参加钢铁、机械的生产，却担负生产钢铁机械所需要的原材料，如焦炭、耐火材料、矽铁、电石、纯碱等等；而对于那些担负科学研究任务较重的学校，则不安排钢铁、机械以及有关原材料的生产。这样，各个学校在钢铁机械方面，就形成了一个大协作的体系。在学校办工厂方面，各校都注意到尽可能结合专业，采取大、中、小并举，即由地方投资学校包建、与有关业务部门合办、学校自办等三种形式；安排这些工厂的生产又采取固定的成批生产和临时的小量试制并举。但是，学校举办的工厂不可能满足教学和科学研究上的全部需要，师生劳动也不能局限于校内，忽视知识分子与工农群众结合，因此又注意对校内劳动与校外劳动作了统筹安排。另一个问题是义务劳动，必须经过一个机关批准，避免多头布置，影响教学计划和打乱全面安排。目前成都市各高等学校和中等专业学校参加义务劳动，分别由市委宣传部、市教育局加以适当控制。
    与此同时，各学校还根据本校性质、专业特点和教学需要，初步确定了生产和科学研究的发展重点。在全市统筹安排上述各项任务时，就充分考虑到各学校不同情况，分别有所侧重，以便各学校把教学、生产劳动和科学研究更加紧密地结合起来。
    在这样全市、全校和系一级的层层统筹安排后，现在，成都市高等学校和中等专业学校教学、生产劳动和科学研究已开始得到正常的开展。　（周祖佑）
