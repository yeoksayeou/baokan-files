To continue vigorously promoting tool reform and raise the labor productivity on China's agricultural front to a new level is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. It is also an important measure to promote the comprehensive development of people's commune economies and a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in China's entire socialist construction.

1959 is a year of a greater leap forward in China's socialist construction. In this year, China's agricultural production will have a greater leap forward than the great leap forward of 1958. Grain production will increase from about 750 billion jin in the previous year to about 1,050 billion jin; cotton will increase from about 67 million dan to about 100 million dan. What does a total grain output of 1,050 billion jin mean? It means an increase of nearly two times compared to 1957. If we further analyze it, to achieve this great goal, we must increase the yield per unit area from 424 jin in 1958 to about 800 jin, which is about three times higher than the yield of 204 jin per mu in 1957. The situation of cotton is roughly the same. The total output is more than three times that of 32.8 million dan in 1957; the yield per unit area is almost three times that of 38 jin in 1957. Under the requirements of such a great leap forward, the labor shortage that occurred in 1958 will still exist this year, and it is very likely to be more serious than last year. According to the understanding of various places in the work of rectifying the communes, the phenomenon of labor shortage exists almost everywhere, with a shortage of 20% for the less and 50% for the more. The labor shortage, on the one hand, shows that China has basically solved the problem of full employment, which is a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. The reactionary population theory that there are too many people and too little land in China, and that the problems of eating and employment cannot be solved, has completely gone bankrupt. But on the other hand, this has brought new problems to China's construction cause.

How to solve the problem of labor shortage? The only correct way is pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party: to "find a way out in doing a good job in tool reform and improving labor organization." Only when one person can do the work of one and a half or two people in the same time and with the same labor intensity, that is, when we increase China's labor productivity by another half or one time, can we fundamentally solve the problem of labor shortage in China this year.

Improving labor productivity mainly depends on two factors: people and tools. The people of our country are brave and hardworking people. Under the education and leadership of the Party, socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm are increasing day by day, and they will certainly be further enhanced. The human factor is very good. What about the tool factor? Through the vigorous tool reform movement last year, we have created many new-style tools and agricultural machines. From cultivation to sowing to harvesting to agricultural product processing, there are various types of innovative tools with high efficiency, simple structure, low cost, and convenient manufacturing. As long as we universally promote the existing new-style tools that have proven to be effective through actual use, and continue to improve them during use, we can not only increase China's labor productivity by half or one time, but even higher. The task facing the Party committees and people's communes at all levels is to vigorously promote the achievements of the 1958 tool reform and continue to vigorously carry out the tool reform movement on this basis, so as to improve China's tool reform movement.

This year, the conditions for carrying out the tool reform movement are even more favorable. We have the rich experience of last year, the more abundant material strength after the bumper harvest, a new technical force cultivated in the process of nationwide steelmaking, and especially the people's commune, a social grassroots organization with unparalleled superiority. As long as we are good at using these favorable conditions, we can completely do a better job in the tool reform movement.

The 1958 tool reform movement tells us that launching a mass movement is the basic key to doing a good job in tool reform. In the movement, we must not only mobilize the broad masses to participate in tool reform, but also strengthen technical guidance and technical training. The tool reform movement is an important part of China's technological revolution. Without the participation of the broad masses and without fully exploiting the wisdom and talents of the masses, it is impossible to accomplish the great historical task of technological revolution well. At the same time, any tool reform requires further improvement in technology, and the use of new tools requires certain operating procedures and technical levels. The more skilled the operator, the more efficient the tool can be. Therefore, while mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform, all localities must strengthen technical guidance, especially technical training for the masses in the use of new tools. Last year, many new-style tools were invented and created in some areas, but they were not promoted and used on a larger scale. One of the important reasons is that the masses could not use them, and the leaders did not promptly grasp the technical training work. This year, we should learn from this lesson, give full play to the role of a group of technical forces cultivated last year, and strengthen technical guidance and technical training.

The experience of the tool reform movement last year also tells us that to carry out the tool reform movement more effectively, we must closely integrate tool reform with the current production, and at the same time, be forward-looking and prepare for the reform of tools in the next step of production as soon as possible. In winter, we must not only combine fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction to vigorously carry out tool reform in this area, but also prepare for spring plowing tools as soon as possible. Failure to integrate with the current production will hinder the progress of production work; neglecting to prepare early will cause passivity in future production. Therefore, when planning this year's tool reform, all localities should not only focus on the tools that urgently need to be reformed at present, but also see the needs of future production labor; not only should they use the greatest effort to reform the farm work that occupies the most labor, such as water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and transportation, but also take into account the improvement of those secondary tools. At present, most regions in the country attach great importance to the reform of water conservancy tools, which is very good. However, while paying attention to the reform of water conservancy tools, some places do not pay enough attention to the reform of spring plowing tools, which should attract special attention from all localities.

Tool reform is a rather complex work that is related to many aspects and needs to be treated carefully. When carrying out tool reform work, we must consider a series of issues related to tool reform and solve them in a timely manner. Tool reform must not only vigorously mobilize the masses to invent and create, but also organize forces to process and manufacture at the same time, and the processing and manufacturing must be combined with the supply of raw materials, the establishment of agricultural tool manufacturing factories, and so on. If any link is not well coordinated, it will affect the further development of the movement. The people's communes in various places must pay special attention to establishing their own agricultural tool factories, because this is a key issue in carrying out this year's tool reform movement. Any tool reform always needs to go through multiple experiments and improvements before it can be finalized and promoted. Finalization means that there are certain specifications and certain technical requirements. Therefore, the finalized new-style farm tools must be manufactured by factories with certain technical equipment. It is difficult to rely entirely on the masses to manufacture them. This year, in order to improve the tool reform movement, the processing and manufacturing problem must be solved. The people's communes and county federations of cooperatives must establish agricultural tool factories with certain technical equipment.

The tool reform movement is a long-term task. From old-style tools to improved tools, from improved tools to new-style tools to agricultural machines, from low-level machines to high-level machines, this is a process of continuous development and continuous improvement. Only continuous reform and continuous improvement can promote the continuous development of productivity. Production never stops, and tool reform never stops. Some areas believe that they have already "completed the tool reform" last year, and therefore relaxed their leadership over the tool reform movement, which is harmful. The tool reform movement is not only a never-ending movement, but also a step-by-step improvement movement. We not only need to carry out the tool reform movement persistently, but also combine the broad mass movement with meticulous scientific research, so that we can improve China's tool reform movement this year to a new level.

The experience of the 1958 tool reform movement is rich, and the conditions for continuing to carry out the tool reform movement are also very favorable. Communes, management districts, production teams, and county federations of cooperatives should divide their responsibilities. Management districts and production teams should be responsible for improving the existing tools, communes should be responsible for manufacturing general improved tools, and county federations of cooperatives should be responsible for manufacturing large and precise tools. Moreover, counties and communes should establish their own tool repair and manufacturing factories, and counties and communes with the conditions should establish ball bearing factories. From now on, we should formulate a year-round tool reform plan and carry it out in a planned and step-by-step manner. We believe that as long as we make full use of last year's experience and this year's favorable conditions, we will definitely be able to carry out the tool reform movement more widely, more deeply, and more effectively, improve labor productivity, and solve the labor shortage, so as to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

### 把工具改革运动更好地开展起来

    把工具改革运动更好地开展起来
    继续大搞工具改革，把我国农业战线上的劳动生产率提高到一个新的水平，这是实现1959年农业生产更大跃进的根本保证，也是促进人民公社经济全面发展和我国整个社会主义建设事业更大更好更全面跃进的重要措施。
    1959年是我国社会主义建设事业更大跃进的一年。这一年，我国的农业生产将比大跃进的1958年有个更大的跃进，粮食生产将由前一年的七千五百亿斤左右增加到一万零五百亿斤左右；棉花将由六千七百万担左右增加到一亿担左右。一万零五百亿斤的粮食总产量意味着什么呢？它意味着比1957年增产将近两倍。如果进一步分析一下，要实现这个伟大的目标，就必须使单位面积产量，从1958年的四百二十四斤提高到八百斤左右，即比1957年的亩产二百零四斤提高三倍左右。棉花的情况也大致如此，总产量等于1957年的三千二百八十万担的三倍多；单位面积产量几乎等于1957年的三十八斤的三倍。在这样的大跃进的要求下，1958年已经发生的劳动力不足的情况今年还会存在，很有可能比去年更严重些。据各地在整社工作中了解，几乎到处都存在着劳动力不足的现象，少的缺20％，多的缺50％。劳动力的不足，一方面表明我国已基本上解决了全民就业的问题，这是社会主义制度的优越性的表现。那种认为中国人多地少，吃饭和就业问题不能解决的反动的人口论彻底破产了。但另一方面，这又为我国的建设事业带来了新的问题。
    怎样解决劳动力不足的问题呢？唯一正确的办法就是党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出的：要“在搞好工具改革方面和改善劳动组织方面找出路”。只有当我们一个人在同样的时间和同样的劳动强度的情况下能够作一个半人、两个人的工作的时候，即把我国的劳动生产率再提高半倍、一倍的时候，才能从根本上解决我国今年劳动力不足的问题。
    提高劳动生产率主要靠人和工具两个因素。我国的人民是勇敢勤劳的人民，在党的教育领导下，社会主义觉悟和劳动热情正在一天天提高，而且还一定会更加提高起来，人的因素是很好的。工具的因素呢？经过去年轰轰烈烈的工具改革运动，我们已经创造出了很多新式工具和农业机器，从耕地到播种到收获到农产品加工都有了效率高、构造简单、成本低、制造方便的各式各样的革新工具。只要我们把已有的经过实际使用证明效果很好的新式工具普遍推广，并在使用过程中继续加以改进，我们不仅能够把我国的劳动生产率提高半倍、一倍，而且还会更高。摆在各级党委和人民公社面前的任务就是大力推广1958年工具改革的成果，并在这一基础上继续大搞工具改革运动，使我国的工具改革运动提高一步。
    今年，开展工具改革运动的条件是更为有利了，我们有了去年的丰富经验，有了大丰收以后更为雄厚的物质力量，有了在全民炼钢过程中培养出来的一支新生的技术力量，特别是有了人民公社这个具有无比优越性的社会基层组织，只要我们善于利用这些有利条件，就完全可以把工具改革运动搞得更好。
    1958年工具改革运动告诉我们，大搞群众运动是搞好工具改革的基本关键。在运动中既要发动广大群众参加工具改革，又要加强技术指导和技术训练。工具改革运动是我国技术革命的重要内容之一，没有广大群众参加，不充分发挥群众的聪明才智，是不可能很好完成技术革命这个伟大的历史任务的。同时，任何工具改革都要求技术上的进一步提高，新工具的使用都需要有一定的操作规程和技术水平，愈是熟练的操作手就愈能发挥工具的效率。因此，各地在发动群众大搞工具改革的同时，必须加强技术指导，特别是对群众使用新工具的技术训练。去年，有些地区发明、创造的新式工具很多，却没有在更大的范围里推广使用，其重要的原因之一，就是群众不会使用，而领导上又没有及时地把技术训练工作抓起来。今年，我们应该很好的接受这个教训，充分发挥去年培养出来的一批技术力量的作用，加强技术指导和技术训练。
    去年工具改革运动的经验也告诉我们，要把工具改革运动更有成效地开展，一定要把工具改革同当前生产紧密结合起来，同时又要高瞻远瞩，及早准备下一步生产中的工具的改革。在冬季，不仅要结合积肥，水利建设大搞这方面的工具改革，还要及早准备春耕工具。不与当前生产结合，就会妨碍生产工作的进行；忽视了及早准备，就会造成将来生产上的被动。因此，各地在规划今年工具改革的时候，既应该抓紧当前急需要改革的工具，又要看到将来的生产劳动的需要；既要用最大的力量改革占用劳动力最多的农活如水利、积肥、运输等方面的工具，也要兼顾那些次要的工具的改良。目前，全国大部分地区都很重视水利工具的改革，这是很好的。但是，在重视改革水利工具的同时，有些地方对春耕工具的改革注意不够，这是应该引起各地特别注意的。
    工具改革是一个同很多方面都有联系的、相当复杂而需要细致对待的工作。我们在进行工具改革工作的时候，必须考虑到与工具改革有关的一系列问题，并及时加以解决。工具改革中不仅要大力发动群众发明创造，还必须同时组织力量进行加工、制造，而加工制造又必须同原材料供应、建立农具制造工厂等等结合起来，无论哪一个环节配合不好，都会影响运动的进一步开展。各地人民公社要特别重视建立自己的农具工厂，因为这是开展今年工具改革运动中一个关键性的问题。任何一种工具改革，总是要经过多次的试验、改进，才能定型推广的。定型就是有一定的规格，有一定的技术要求。因此，必须由具有一定技术装备的工厂来制造定型了的新式农具，完全依靠群众制造是困难的。今年，为了把工具改革运动提高一步，必须解决加工制造问题，人民公社和县联社必须建立起具有一定技术装备的农具工厂。
    工具改革运动是一个长期的工作，从旧式工具到改良工具，从改良工具到新式工具到农业机器，从低级的机器到高级的机器，这是一个不断发展、不断提高的过程，只有不断的改革，不断的提高，才能促进生产力不断地向前发展。生产永世不停，工具改革也永世不断。有的地区认为去年已经“把工具改革完了”，因而放松了对工具改革运动的领导，这是有害的。工具改革运动不仅是一个永不停息的运动，还是一个步步提高的运动，我们不仅需要把工具改革运动持久地开展起来，而且还应该把广大的群众运动同细致的科学研究工作结合起来，这样我们才能够把我国今年的工具改革运动提高到一个新的水平。
    1958年工具改革运动的经验是丰富的，继续开展工具改革运动的条件也是十分优越的。公社、管理区、生产队和县联社应当分工负责，管理区和生产队要担负制造现有工具的改良工作，公社则担负制造一般性的改良工具，县联社又担负制造大型精密的工具，并且县和公社都建立起自己的工具修理和制造工厂，县和有条件的公社都建立起滚珠轴承工厂，从现在起就拟定出全年工具改革计划，有计划有步骤地进行。我们相信，只要充分运用去年的经验和今年的有利条件，我们就一定能够更广泛、更深入、更有成效地开展工具改革运动，提高劳动生产率和解决劳动力的不足，实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进。
