    The National Agricultural Exhibition is like a treasure trove
    Farmer Representatives Diligently Study Advanced Experiences, Lingering and Reluctant to Leave
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: (Our reporter reports:) The National Agricultural Exhibition, showcasing the brilliant achievements made on China's agricultural front in 1958, welcomed its first guests. Six thousand representatives of the five hundred million heroic farmers visited this grand exhibition after its opening today. These heroes on the agricultural front were equally joyful and excited to see the results of their year-long hard work. In each exhibition hall, they always looked for the achievements of their region or unit. When they found them, they were very happy, as if they had met a long-lost relative. However, they were more concerned with "seeking knowledge," looking for things that would benefit the production of their region or unit to take back.
    In the grain hall of the crop pavilion, the large-scale high-yield experiences of wheat, rice, and various coarse grains, as well as the high-yield plants, were praised by many representatives as the best "grain production textbooks." Ma Yongxiang, a representative of the Hongxing Commune in Bei'an County, Heilongjiang Province, diligently copied many high-yield experiences in the grain room. He did not stop writing until the loudspeaker announced that the representatives should gather to board the bus. His diary was filled with small, dense characters, totaling nine pages. Cui Xibao, a representative of the Sunjiacha Commune in Shenmu County, northern Shaanxi, was particularly interested in the experience of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in overcoming cold weather and achieving high yields. After carefully studying the experience of cold-bed insulation and early rice transplanting in Yanbian, he excitedly said, "Yanbian is colder than northern Shaanxi, and the conditions for growing rice are worse. What they can do, we can also do; what they can produce in high yields, we can also produce in high yields."
    Representatives from wheat-producing areas paid special attention to the experience in wheat field management. Some copied the experience of field management but felt it was too simple, and inquired where they could buy detailed materials introducing these experiences. Li Shanhong, a representative of the Zhongcun Commune in Zhaoyuan County, Shandong Province, felt more confident in achieving high wheat yields in his commune this year after reading many wheat high-yield experiences. He carefully considered the measures of applying topdressing fertilizer, frequent watering, and eliminating the three types of seedlings. He said, "We are confident in grasping these measures well."
    Similarly, in the cotton room of the crop pavilion, Jiang Bimao and Jiang Yuanhu, representatives of the Wanxian Prefecture in Sichuan Province, were particularly busy. They were either bowing their heads to count cotton bolls or asking the guide about the origin of excellent cotton seeds. Jiang Bimao and Jiang Yuanhu are both village branch secretaries and representatives of grain-rich villages. They carefully copied the cotton yield increase experience entirely for the purpose of growing a lot of cotton in Sichuan this year. He said with a smile to the reporter: "Our rice can produce more than two thousand catties per mu, but cotton is not good. In 1958, each mu only produced more than sixty catties. This year we must strive for a simultaneous leap forward in grain and cotton."
    Today, the special product room of the crop pavilion became a particularly eye-catching place. The rich and colorful, dazzling array of products made people envious. Kong Qingfa, a representative from Liaoning Province and the party secretary of the Qingdui People's Commune in Zhuanghe County, was taking notes, however, carefully recording the experience of the seventh team of the Huohua People's Commune in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, which produced more than two hundred catties of cocoons per silkworm egg sheet in autumn. He excitedly told reporters that our commune only has tussah silkworms. This year, in addition to raising more tussah silkworms, we also plan to vigorously plant mulberry trees to raise mulberry silkworms. Jiang Nianping, a representative of Jinsha County in Guizhou Province, carefully visited the high-yield tea in She County, Anhui Province, with an average yield of more than one hundred and forty catties per mu. He said that after learning about the tea-growing experience in other regions, we are more confident and plan to expand the tea garden this year. Wu Chengyin, a representative of Ziyang County in Sichuan Province, carefully inquired with the narrator about the experience of high-yield peanuts in the Yonghong People's Commune in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, and asked the exhibition for information on peanut high-yield, also for the purpose of expanding peanut planting this year.
    The rural industry pavilion was also a place of interest to many representatives. Here, many representatives looked more carefully, and more people took notes on industrial products made from agricultural products and manufacturing methods. This fully demonstrates their ambition to run industry. Many representatives are already very familiar with the Henan low-temperature steelmaking furnace, the indigenous reverberatory furnace, and the Hunan Shaoyang water bottle steelmaking furnace exhibited in the center of the pavilion, and can also talk about the different advantages of these furnaces. Representatives from Sichuan said: "Don't underestimate indigenous steelmaking. Today's modern steelmaking Bessemer furnace was developed from indigenous steelmaking."
    The water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, and protection rooms of the yield increase measures pavilion were very appropriately called the "treasure house of the Eight-Character Charter" by many representatives. The experience of "eight waters and six fertilizers" for wheat high yield in the Heping Commune in Xiping County, Henan Province, exhibited in the water conservancy room, attracted many representatives. Jin Changji, a Korean representative of the Chaomei Commune in Wangqing County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, thought that this experience clearly stated the relationship between various yield increase measures. He said: It is very important to fully implement the Eight-Character Charter. Deep plowing is the center. With deep plowing, more fertilizer should be used, and more water should also be used. Last year, our place only produced more than 8,000 catties of wheat per hectare (fifteen mu). The measures were not grasped enough. To realize the Ten Major Initiatives this year, these measures must be followed up.
    Many problems that were previously difficult to understand in terms of technical measures were also answered here by the representatives. Wang Peimei, a representative of the Weixing Commune in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, compared the two cotton plants planted in deep-plowed land and shallow-cultivated land, looking at them again and again. The one in the deep-plowed land was tall and large, with roots more than three feet deep and more than ninety cotton bolls; the one in the shallow-cultivated land had roots only one foot deep and more than twenty cotton bolls. After seeing it, he said excitedly: "In the past, I thought that cotton roots were shallow and did not necessarily require deep plowing. This time I must go back and deep plow the cotton fields." Jin Jixing and Jin Shanghui, labor models from Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, compared the successful experience in the dense planting room and discussed the lessons of their failure in dense planting last year. Last year, they had three mu of experimental fields densely planted at 3×4 inches, but the plowing was shallow, and too much fertilizer was applied, resulting in poor ventilation, leaf rot and lodging in the later stage. They are determined to bring the high-yield experience here back.
    In the forestry, animal husbandry, aquatic products and other pavilions, today was also crowded with representatives with various different requirements and interests. Representatives from Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang were mostly talking in the animal husbandry pavilion, and more female representatives visited the women's pavilion. Most of those in the forestry pavilion were very concerned about the experience of greening. Liu Ziqing, a representative from Hebei Province, was excited when he heard the narrator in the forestry pavilion talk about the vision of turning the land into a garden. He said: "Our Qincun People's Commune has already planted mulberry, pear, apricot, and sand fruit trees on the plains. This year, we also plan to afforest 20,000 mu. We have already transported tree seedlings to Henan, Anhui and other places. As long as everyone works together, Chairman Mao's great ideal of landscaping will not be difficult to achieve."

    全国农展会好似宝山
    农民代表孜孜研习先进经验留连忘返
    新华社3日讯  本社记者报道：展出1958年我国农业战线上所取得的辉煌战果的全国农业展览会接待了它的第一批客人。五亿英雄农民的六千名代表，在今天开幕后参观了这个规模宏大的展览会。这些农业战线上的英雄们，看到自己一年苦战取得的战果，同样是喜悦的，兴奋的。在各个展览馆里，他们总是寻找自己地区或自己单位的成绩。找到了就非常高兴，像遇到了久别的亲人一样。但是，他们更关心的却是“取经”，寻找对自己地区或自己单位生产有益的东西带回去。
    在农作物馆粮食室大厅里，小麦、水稻、各类杂粮的大面积丰产经验和粮食作物的丰产棵，被许多代表誉为最好的“粮食生产教科书”。黑龙江省北安县红星公社的代表马永祥，在粮食室勤恳地抄了很多丰产经验，直到广播器宣布代表集合上车，他还没有停笔，日记本上密密麻麻的小字整整写了九页。陕北神木县孙家岔公社的代表崔希保，对延边朝鲜族自治州战胜水冷天寒，取得丰产的经验特别感到兴趣。他仔细地看了延边冷床保温育苗提前插秧的经验以后，兴奋地说：“延边比陕北更冷，种稻条件更差，他们能怎样办，我们也能怎样办；他们能高产，我们也能高产。”
    小麦产区的代表特别注意麦田管理方面的经验，有的抄下了田间管理的经验还嫌简单，又打听在哪里能买到介绍这些经验的详细资料。山东省招远县中村公社的代表李善洪看了许多小麦丰产经验后，对实现他们公社今年小麦高产的信心更大了。他仔细盘算了施追肥、勤浇水、消灭三类苗等多方面的措施。他说：“我们有把握抓好这些措施。”
    同样在农作物馆的棉花室里，四川省万县专区的代表姜必茂、江远虎显得特别忙碌，他们一会儿低头数着棉桃，一会儿找讲解员询问优良棉种的产地。姜必茂、江远虎都是乡支部书记，粮食丰产乡的代表。他们这样细心地抄写棉花的增产经验，完全是为了今年四川要大种棉花。他笑着对记者说：“我们的水稻每亩能产二千多斤，棉花可不行，1958年每亩只产了六十多斤。今年我们一定要力争粮棉齐跃进。”
    农作物馆的特产室今天成了特别引人注目的地方。丰富多彩、琳琅满目的产品使人羡慕。辽宁省的代表、庄河县清堆人民公社党委书记孔庆发却拿着笔记本在详细抄记四川省南充县火花人民公社第七大队秋蚕每张蚕种产茧二百多斤的经验。他兴奋地对记者说，我们公社只有柞蚕，今年除多养柞蚕外，还计划大力种植桑树养桑蚕。贵州省金沙县的代表姜念平非常认真地参观了安徽省歙县平均亩产一百四十多斤的高产茶叶。他说，学习了其他地区的种茶经验以后，我们的信心更足了，今年计划扩大茶园。四川省资阳县代表吴承荫仔细地向说明员询问湖北省红安县永红人民公社高产花生的经验，向展览会要花生丰产的资料，同样是为了今年扩大种植花生。
    农村工业馆也是很多代表感兴趣的地方。在这里，许多代表看得更仔细，认真抄记由农产品加工成的工业产品和制造方法的人更多。这充分表现了他们办工业的雄心。很多代表对于馆中央展出的河南低温炼钢炉、土法反射炼钢炉、湖南邵阳放水瓶炼钢炉等已经非常在行，也能讲这些炉子不同的优点了。四川的代表说：“不要小看土法炼钢，今天现代化炼钢的贝氏炉，就是从土法炼钢搞起来的呢。”
    增产措施馆水、肥、土、种、密、保各室，被很多代表非常恰当地说成是“八字宪法的宝库”。水利室展出的河南省西平县和平公社小麦丰产“八水六肥”的经验，吸引着很多代表。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州汪清县超美公社的朝鲜族代表金昌极看了，认为这个经验把各项增产措施的关系说得明确，他说：全面执行八字宪法很要紧，深翻是中心，深翻了，用肥要多，水也要用多了。我们那里去年每垧（十五市亩）产麦才八千多斤，措施还抓得不够，今年要实现十大倡议，这些措施一定都要跟上去。
    许多过去对技术措施方面疑难不解的问题，代表们也都在这里找到答案。山西省运城县卫星公社的代表王佩玫对种在深翻地和浅耕地上的两株棉花，对比着看了又看。深翻地上的一株又高又大，三尺多深的根，九十多个棉桃；浅耕地上的一株根只扎一尺多深，二十多个棉桃。他看后很激动地说：“过去，我以为棉花根浅，不一定要深翻。这次回去一定要把棉田也深翻好。”来自黑龙江省五常县的劳模金基星和金尚会，在密植室里对照着成功的经验，还讨论了他们去年密植失败的教训。去年，他们社里有三亩试验田密植3×4寸，但是翻的浅，施肥又多，后期就发生了通风不好，烂叶倒伏现象。他们决心把这里的丰产经验带回去。
    在林业、畜牧、水产和其他各馆里，今天也拥挤着各种不同要求、不同兴趣的代表。内蒙古、新疆的代表在畜牧馆里很多在交谈，女代表们在妇女馆里参观的就多些。在林业馆的多半是很关心绿化的经验。河北省代表刘子清，在林业馆里听讲解员谈大地园林化的远景时，他兴奋地说：“我们秦村人民公社在平川地上已经栽上了桑、梨、杏、沙果等树。今年还计划造林二万亩。我们已经到河南、安徽等地运树苗去了。只要大家齐心干，毛主席关于园林化的伟大理想就不难实现。”（附图片）
