Talking About Exams

    The end-of-term examinations are underway in schools of all levels across the country. This semester has been an extraordinary one. Various regions have implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor. Students have not only learned theoretical knowledge from books in the classroom, but also acquired rich practical knowledge through productive labor. These two aspects of knowledge have played a significant role in improving the quality of learning. The results of the end-of-term examination grading at the Beijing Institute of Mining provide a good illustration of the significant improvement in academic performance.

    It is necessary to conduct an examination at the end of a semester. Examinations are a necessary method in the teaching process for systematically organizing, consolidating, and improving learning at a certain stage. Through examinations, we can more comprehensively understand our teaching effectiveness and check students' acquisition of knowledge, making a general systematic assessment of the achievements of teaching and learning on a regular basis. Through the end-of-term examination, we can review what has been done well and what has not been done well in the teaching work of this semester, and why. In this way, we can gradually improve our work. As for the examination methods, they should be based on the spirit of linking theory with practice, not only assessing the students' understanding and mastery of the theoretical part, but also assessing their ability to apply theory to practice. Giving the examination new content and grading methods should be a characteristic of this semester's end-of-term examination.

    At present, the school Party committee urgently needs to do ideological work to help teachers and students correct their understanding of examinations. Teachers and students should cooperate well. Teachers should seize the time during students' review period to guide students and help them better review the knowledge they have learned; students should also conscientiously review and prepare lessons, and welcome the first examination after the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor with full spirit, earnestly and cheerfully.

    谈考试
    全国各地大中小学校正在进行期终考试。这学期是一个不平凡的学期。各地贯彻了教育同生产劳动相结合的方针，学生不仅在课堂上学习了书本理论知识，并且在生产劳动中学习了丰富的实际知识。这两方面的知识，对于学习质量的提高，起了很大的作用。北京矿业学院的期终考试评分结果，学习成绩的显著提高，就是一个很好的说明。
    在一个学期的期末，进行一次考试是很必要的。考试是在教学过程中对一个阶段的学习进行系统整理、巩固和提高的必要方法，通过考试可以更全面地了解我们的教学效果和检查学生获取知识的情况，把平日教和学的成绩做一次总的系统的考核。通过期终考试，可以回顾一下，本学期的教学工作那些做得好，那些做得不好；为什么做得好，又为什么做得不好。这样，才能使我们的工作逐渐提高。至于考试的方法，应当根据理论联系实际的精神，不但考核学生对理论部分的理解和掌握程度，也要考核学生将理论用之实践的能力。给考试以新的内容和评分方法，这应该是本学期期终考试的一个特点。
    目前学校党委急需做好思想工作，帮助教师和学生端正对考试的认识。师生应很好地合作。教师要在学生温课复习期间，抓紧对学生的指导，帮助学生更好地复习所学知识；学生也要认真进行复习温课，以饱满的精神，认真愉快地迎接贯彻教育同生产劳动相结合的方针后的第一次考试。
