    Another Group of Sisters Flies in the Motherland's Sky
    China's Second Group of Female Aviators Graduates
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th - China's second group of twenty-one female aviators recently graduated from a certain aviation school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. They will serve the motherland's aviation cause as pilots, navigators, and communications personnel.
    This group of female aviators enrolled in 1957. After more than a year of study, they have all mastered aviation technology. The flight class averaged 110 hours of flight time per person in eight months, creating the first "all-red" class graduation achievement since the establishment of this aviation school. The navigation class averaged 96 hours of flight time per person, with an average graduation exam score of 4.7, better than the academic performance of previous classes. The communications class achieved "all-red" in both theoretical study and field training.
    China's first group of female aviators graduated from another aviation school of the PLA Air Force in 1951. Many of them have been diligently flying on the motherland's aviation lines for several years.
