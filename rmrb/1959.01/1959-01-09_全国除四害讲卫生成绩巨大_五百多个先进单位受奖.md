Xinhua News Agency, 7th — The Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee held an awards ceremony on the evening of the 6th for advanced units in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene. Three provinces and cities—Beijing, Shanghai, and Fujian—along with eighteen special districts, three hundred and one cities and counties, as well as people's communes, industrial and mining enterprises, military units, schools, and resident committees, totaling five hundred and forty-five advanced units, were awarded.

In the past year, under the leadership of the Party, outstanding achievements have been made in the work of eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eradicating the diseases that most severely endanger the people. In the advanced areas, the appearance of hygiene work has been fundamentally changed. Among the advanced units, some have done a regular and thorough job of eliminating the four pests; some have fully mobilized the masses, broken superstitions, and created many new and effective prevention and control methods, greatly promoting the great leap forward in hygiene work; some have closely integrated hygiene work with production, making it serve production more prominently, ensuring the health of the people and production. All of these have promoted the progress of hygiene work in various places and played a good demonstrative role.

The awards were presented by Li Dequan, Minister of Health, and Vice Ministers Xu Yunbei, Zhang Kai, Wu Yunfu, Cui Yitian, and others. Li Dequan and Zhang Kai spoke at the meeting. Li Dequan said that the current work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene has achieved great results nationwide, with a large number of the four pests eliminated, and the incidence of schistosomiasis, kala-azar, and hookworm disease has been greatly reduced. In the future, we must make further efforts to eliminate the four pests. She emphasized that hygiene work should strengthen the leadership of the Party, combine scientific forces with mass movements, and promote a greater leap forward in hygiene work. Zhang Kai said that the work of eliminating the four pests in 1958 fully proved that the four pests can be eliminated, and the diseases that most severely endanger the people can also be eliminated; at the same time, it also proved that eliminating the four pests is not a simple and easy task, and requires repeated and arduous struggles, and must not be relaxed. He pointed out that in 1959, special attention should be paid to the hygiene work in public canteens and kindergartens of people's communes, and in various industrial and mining enterprises, to ensure the health of the people and the normal progress of industrial and agricultural production. He hoped that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the advanced units and advanced representatives would, together with the people of the whole country, play a leading and promoting role in the struggle against the four pests and diseases. We must strive to basically achieve the goal of "four withouts" (no rats, no sparrows, no flies, no mosquitoes) and eliminate the diseases that most severely endanger the people in all places where it is possible, and greet the great tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    全国除四害讲卫生成绩巨大
    五百多个先进单位受奖
    新华社7日讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会6日晚举行除四害、讲卫生先进单位给奖大会，北京、上海、福建三个省市，还有十八个专区、三百零一个市县以及人民公社、工矿企业、部队、学校、居民委员会等共五百四十五个先进单位受到了奖励。
    一年来，各地除四害、讲卫生、消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的工作，在党的领导下，作出了优异的成绩，各先进地区已经基本上改变了卫生工作面貌。在先进单位中，有的除四害工作做得经常而又彻底；有的单位充分发动了群众，破除迷信，创造了许多新的有效的防治方法，大大促进了卫生工作的跃进；有的单位紧密结合生产，使卫生工作为生产服务方面做得比较突出，保证了人民的健康和生产。所有这些，都推动了各地卫生工作的进展，起了很好的示范作用。
    大会由卫生部部长李德全、副部长徐运北、张凯、伍云甫、崔义田等发奖状。李德全、张凯在会上讲了话。李德全说，全国目前除四害、讲卫生工作已取得了很大成绩，消灭了大量的四害，血吸虫病、黑热病、钩虫病的患病率已经大大降低，今后，我们要进一步努力消灭四害。她强调说，卫生工作要加强党的领导，把科学力量与群众运动结合起来，促使卫生工作出现更大的跃进。张凯说，1958年的除四害工作充分证明，四害是可以消灭的，危害人民最严重的疾病也是可以消除；同时又证明，除尽四害不是一件简单容易的事情，要经过反复艰巨的斗争，绝不能放松。他指出，1959年特别要抓紧人民公社中的公共食堂、幼儿园和各工矿企业的卫生工作，保障人民身体健康，保证工农业生产的正常进行。他希望各先进单位、先进代表在党和毛主席的领导下与全国人民一道，在向四害和疾病作斗争中，起带头和推动作用。要在一切可能做到的地方，争取基本实现四无和消灭危害人民最严重的疾病，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
