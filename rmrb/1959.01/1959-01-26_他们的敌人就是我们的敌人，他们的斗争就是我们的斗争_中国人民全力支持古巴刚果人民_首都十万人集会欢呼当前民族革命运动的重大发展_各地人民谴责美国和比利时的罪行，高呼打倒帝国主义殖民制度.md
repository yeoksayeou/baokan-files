Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: Today, more than 100,000 people in Beijing gathered to express their full support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. While a mass rally of people from all walks of life was held in the gymnasium, many factories, schools, and suburban people's communes also held rallies, forming a climax of the citywide activities in recent days to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people.

The largest mass rally was held in the gymnasium, where more than 10,000 people gathered. People raised their fists and shouted: "Support the Cuban National Democratic Revolution!" "Support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence!" They angrily shouted the slogan "Down with the imperialist colonial system!"

At 9:00 a.m., Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Chairman of the Chinese Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, announced the start of the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people.

Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke amidst warm applause. Peng Zhen announced at the meeting that the 650 million Chinese people are on the same front with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for independence and freedom. Because US imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan.

Peng Zhen said forcefully that their enemies are also our enemies, and their struggles are also our struggles. He said that colonialism and imperialism are about to end, and the people of Latin America and Africa are bound to win.

Peng Zhen said: The struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people are a major development in the current national revolution movement. He emphasized that all the Chinese people resolutely support the Cuban people's national democratic revolution and resolutely support the Congolese people's struggle for freedom and independence. His speech aroused storms of applause in the audience.

Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said at the meeting: The victory won by the heroic Cuban people under the leadership of Castro is not only a great victory for the Cuban people in their struggle for national independence and freedom, but also a major defeat for US imperialism's policy of aggression in Latin America. The heroic actions of the Congolese people against colonialism show that there is no longer any "stable oasis" for imperialism on the African continent. Zhang Zhizhong emphasized that the current era is an era of continuous growth of the forces of peace and an era of vigorous development of the national independence movement. No matter how cunning and ferocious imperialism is, it cannot stop the torrent of this era.

Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: We firmly support the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people against imperialism. The imperialist aggressors are bound to suffer a shameful defeat in the end, and the Cuban and Congolese people are bound to win the final victory.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his speech: The Chinese people fully sympathize with and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. He said that the Chinese people know from their own experience in the struggle against imperialism that imperialism is a paper tiger, bullying the weak and fearing the strong. As long as they persist in the struggle and resolutely fight back, imperialist aggression and interference can be completely defeated.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of the workers of China, expressing full support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. He said: The Chinese working class is watching with great anger the various conspiracies of US imperialism to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cuban people. All US interference activities tell the Cuban people, and the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries, that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, especially the people of Latin America. Liu Changsheng also expressed his admiration for the heroic struggle of the Congolese people. He said that we express our greatest protest against the Belgian colonial authorities' brutal suppression of the just struggle of the Congolese people.

Liu Xiyuan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China and Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, said: 120 million young people in China, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely stand on the side of the Cuban and Congolese people and fully support their just struggle.

Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation, spoke on behalf of mothers. She said that the Chinese people and women have personally experienced the same fate as the Cuban and Congolese people. We only achieved victory after carrying out a resolute struggle against the imperialists. She said that despite the extreme ferocity of imperialism, the people of Cuba and the Congo are waging a heroic struggle. The people who have stood up will never be intimidated by bayonets, guns, and machine guns.

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, condemned the US imperialists and Belgian colonialists for their tyrannical interference and bloody massacre of the Cuban and Congolese people, saying that this is not only an act of hostility towards the Cuban and Congolese people, but also an act of hostility towards the peace-loving people of the world. We must not tolerate such piracy and butcher behavior. He said that the people of our country, including the industrial and commercial circles, must support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people with the greatest sympathy.

Guo Yonghuai, Deputy Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a well-known scientist, demanded that US imperialism and all colonialists must get out of Latin America and Africa! He shouted: Latin America and Africa will always belong to the people of Latin America and Africa!

Shu Sheyu, a representative of Beijing's literary and art workers and a well-known writer, exposed the ugly face of the imperialists' disguise at the meeting. He said: The imperialists have always used the most vicious means to oppress others, while constantly shouting "freedom," "freedom"! It seems as if they are the incarnations of the most beautiful goddess of freedom. The writer said, heroic Cuban and Congolese people, you have clearly seen the true face of the imperialists, and you will no longer be deceived and oppressed. The Chinese people support you, and the people with justice all over the world support you.

Workers' representative Hang Baohua, farmers' representative Tong Delu, and students' representative Pang Chunlan spoke at the meeting one after another. They represented the workers, peasants, and students of Beijing to warmly celebrate the major victory already achieved by the Cuban National Democratic Revolution and hailed the vigorous development of the Congolese people's anti-imperialist struggle. They also warned US imperialism and the Belgian colonial authorities: The torrent of national liberation movement cannot be stopped. (The full text of the speeches of Zhang Zhizhong and other twelve people can be found on the second page)

The live situation of the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people was broadcast live by the Central People's Broadcasting Station and Beijing Television. People were listening in factories, schools, shops, and homes. Some people called the meeting to express their indignation and support. At the same time, in factories such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, North China Radio Equipment Factory, schools such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing No. 23 Middle School, and people's communes such as Chaoyang, Haidian, and Huangtugang in the suburbs, and some government agencies also held rallies. They unanimously supported the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people and severely condemned the US imperialists and Belgian colonialists.

Today, participants in the rally of people from all walks of life in the capital to support the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people included workers, peasants, students, government cadres, and people from the industrial and commercial circles, as well as heads of the central government, Beijing's democratic parties, and people's organizations. Some peace-loving people, experts, and students from Africa and Latin America in Beijing also participated in the meeting.

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution supporting the anti-imperialist struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. At this time, Liao Chengzhi announced to the meeting that many large enterprises, government agencies, schools, people's communes, etc. in Beijing and many provinces and cities across the country have also held similar rallies. This is the unanimous voice of our 650 million Chinese people. It expresses our internationalist support for the brothers in Cuba and the Congo who are waging anti-imperialist struggles, and it is also our most resolute protest against imperialism. At this time, tens of thousands of people in the venue stood up and angrily shouted: "Oppose US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs!" "Oppose the Belgian colonial authorities' massacre of the Congolese people!" "Imperialism get out of Asia!" "Imperialism get out of Africa!" "Imperialism get out of Latin America!" "Belgian colonialists get out of the Congo!"

This newspaper reports that people across our country have expressed their firm support for the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle against imperialism and strongly condemned US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' crimes in suppressing the Congolese people. People and people from all walks of life in Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Harbin and other cities and Fujian Province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held separate meetings to express the solemn position of the Chinese people. The people angrily shouted: "Down with the imperialist colonial system!" (For details, see page 3) (Attached picture)
