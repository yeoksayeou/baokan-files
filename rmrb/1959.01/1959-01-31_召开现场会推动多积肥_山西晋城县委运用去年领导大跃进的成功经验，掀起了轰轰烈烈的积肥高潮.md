(Our newspaper's correspondent in Taiyuan reports on the 30th) The Jincheng County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shanxi Province recently convened on-the-spot mobile promotion meetings on manure accumulation in advanced People's Communes such as Liukou and Jinmiaopu. The meeting was personally presided over by the County Party Secretary, and responsible cadres from eleven communes participated. The mobile on-the-spot meeting adopted the method of visiting and discussing simultaneously, focusing on introducing and promoting the most prominent experiences of each commune. This method of meeting has also been applied in other People's Communes and within the People's Communes in this county. Facts have proved that mobile on-the-spot meetings are a good way to deeply mobilize the masses, exchange manure accumulation experience, and push the manure accumulation movement to a climax.

At this mobile on-the-spot manure accumulation promotion meeting, the experience of Liukou Commune in strengthening leadership in manure accumulation, rationally arranging labor, and implementing quota management was emphasized. The experience of Jinmiaopu in mobilizing the masses to widely find sources of fertilizer was also introduced. An important experience of Liukou Commune is the adoption of the "grasping the watermelon and bringing along the sesame seeds" method, which means taking manure accumulation as the center and driving other rural production work. The so-called "grasping the watermelon" means "fertilizer takes command," drawing 75% of the commune's labor force into the manure accumulation movement, and 25% of the labor force for small-scale water conservancy construction, sideline production, and spring plowing preparation. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee personally grasped the manure accumulation work, and the members of the Commune Party Committee were assigned manure accumulation tasks. In carrying out the manure accumulation movement, labor quota management was also implemented. Therefore, this commune has achieved brilliant results in manure accumulation, and other work has also been taken care of. The commune originally planned to apply 800 dan of fertilizer per mu, and now it has accumulated 70%; the sideline income was originally planned to be an average of 15 to 20 yuan per person before the Spring Festival, and now the average income per person is 10 yuan. The experience of Jinmiaopu Commune is "one grasp (greatly grasp fertilizer) and three combinations (combining accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, combining accumulating and delivering fertilizer, combining accumulating fertilizer and hygiene), and six fixings (fixing labor, fixing time, fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing quotas, and fixing reward system)." At the same time, the methods of inspection and evaluation, and rewarding models were used to mobilize the masses and open up a wide range of fertilizer sources. The entire commune has accumulated more than 4 million dan of fertilizer in half a month.

Through on-the-spot visits and inspections, the cadres' horizons were broadened, their minds were liberated, they learned from experience, and they also carried out friendly competitions with each other. This on-the-spot meeting also formulated "three grasps and three competitions," "ten combinations," and "six fixed" manure accumulation goals and specific methods. Each commune also proposed to achieve the following before the Spring Festival: 1. The amount of manure accumulation should account for 80% of the fertilizer application plan per mu. 2. The average sideline income per person should be 15 to 20 yuan. 3. Crop stalks should be composted into fertilizer. 4. People's Communes should universally establish indigenous chemical fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, bittern plants, and indigenous pesticide plants. 5. Each production team should establish a high-quality seed warehouse.

In order to universally and deeply develop the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the county, the Jincheng County Party Committee called on the county at the meeting to accumulate another 48.5 billion jin of fertilizer before the Spring Festival, and also requested that the experience of Liukou and Jinmiaopu in taking manure accumulation and fertilizer production as the center to drive other rural production work be universally promoted throughout the county. It also proposed to carry out large-scale assaults, large-scale competitions, large-scale inspections, and large-scale evaluation and comparison movements.

At present, the People's Communes in Jincheng County have universally promoted the experience of this on-the-spot manure accumulation promotion meeting, and a vigorous manure accumulation movement has been fiercely launched. The county's manure accumulation has increased from an average of 304 dan per mu to 387 dan. (Li Yuxiu)

    召开现场会推动多积肥
    山西晋城县委运用去年领导大跃进的成功经验，掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥高潮
    本报太原30日电　中共山西晋城县委最近在柳口、晋庙铺等积肥先进的人民公社，召开了积肥流动现场促进会议。这次会议由县委书记亲自主持，有十一个公社的负责干部参加。流动现场会议是采取边流动参观，边讨论研究的办法举行的，集中各个公社最突出的经验加以介绍与推广。这种会议的方法，在这个县的其他人民公社和人民公社的内部也已运用起来。事实证明：流动现场会议是深入发动群众交流积肥经验，把积肥运动推向高潮的一种好形式。
    在这个积肥流动现场促进会上，着重介绍了柳口公社加强积肥领导，合理安排劳力，实行定额管理的经验；介绍了晋庙铺发动群众，广泛寻找肥源的经验。柳口公社的重要经验是：采取了“抓西瓜带芝麻”的办法，这就是，以积肥为中心，带动其他农村生产工作。所谓抓西瓜就是“肥料挂帅”，抽调全公社75％的劳动力投入了积肥运动，25％的劳动力进行小型水利建设、副业生产、春耕准备工作。公社党委第一书记亲自抓积肥工作，公社党委委员都分配了积肥任务。在开展积肥运动中，又实行了劳动定额管理。因此，这个公社积肥战果辉煌，其他工作也都照顾到了。公社原计划每亩施肥八百担，现在已积到70％；副业收入原计划春节前每人平均收入十五至二十元，现在每人平均收入十元。晋庙铺公社的经验是，“一抓（大抓肥料）三结合（积肥与造肥结合、积肥与送肥结合、积肥与讲卫生结合），六定（定劳力、定时间、定任务、定质量、定定额、定奖励制度）”，同时运用检查评比，奖励模范等办法，发动群众，广开肥源，全社半个月已积肥料四百多万担。
    经过现场参观和检查，使干部开了眼界、解放了思想、学到了经验，并且相互间开展了友谊竞赛。这次现场会议还制定了“三抓三争”、“十结合”、“六固定”的积肥目标和具体办法。各社还提出在春节前做到：一、积肥量占每亩施肥计划的80％。二、副业每人平均收入十五元至二十元。三、农作物秸秆要沤成肥料。四、各人民公社要普遍建立土化肥厂、颗粒肥厂、卤水厂、土农药厂。五、每个生产队建立一个优种仓库。
    为了使全县的积肥造肥运动普遍深入地展开，晋城县委在会议上号召全县在春节前再积肥四百八十五亿斤的任务，并且要求在全县范围内普遍推广柳口、晋庙铺以积肥造肥为中心带动其他农村生产工作的经验，还提出开展大突击、大竞赛、大检查、大评比运动。
    目前，晋城县各人民公社普遍推广了这种积肥流动现场促进会议的经验，一个轰轰烈烈的积肥运动已经猛烈地开展起来了。全县积肥由原来每亩平均三百零四担已经增加到三百八十七担。　（李玉秀）
