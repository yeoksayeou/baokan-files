From the Editor:

	One Use Becomes Many Uses

The rope-traction machine was first created in Jiangsu. Last year it was only used for deep plowing, and it attracted everyone's attention. After several months of promotion and improvement in Jiangsu, now it can be used for major field operations such as fertilizing, harrowing, harvesting, and even water control. Changing one use into multiple uses will, of course, be more welcomed by everyone.

Since the rope-traction machine can be widely used and improve work efficiency, it can be vigorously promoted in various regions. There will inevitably be difficulties in the beginning when promoting any new tool, but as long as the leadership is determined, uses facts to persuade people, firmly relies on the masses, and starts with indigenous methods, opening the first hurdle, it can enter a better state step by step.

    一用变多用
    绳索牵引机是江苏首创的。去年还只是用它来深耕，便引起大家的注意。江苏经过几个月的推广改进，现在连田间主要操作，如施肥、耙地、收割甚至治水都用得上。变一种用途为多种用途，这，当然更会受到大家的欢迎。
    绳索牵引机既然能广泛应用，又能提高工效，各地就可以大力推广。推广任何一种新工具，开头一定少不了困难，但是，只要像江苏那样，领导上拿定主意，用事实说服人，坚定依靠群众，土法上马，打开了第一关，就能一步一步进入佳境。
