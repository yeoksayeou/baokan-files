Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 28th: Leopoldville news: On the evening of the 27th, some Africans in Leopoldville, disregarding the curfew imposed by the colonial authorities, hastily erected barricades on two main streets and then threw stones and metal fragments at armed patrols.

    After new acts of resistance occurred that day, the colonial authorities in the Congolese capital sent out motorized patrols to suppress them. But as dusk fell, many Africans quietly emerged from their homes and quickly built barricades between two main roads using branches, old furniture, straw mats, and broken bottles. They left as soon as they finished their work. When the police passed by, they threw stones and other objects at them from their homes.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 28th: Leopoldville news: The people of Leopoldville, the capital of Congo, launched another act of resistance today. The Belgian colonial authorities even dispatched armed forces, using rifles instead of batons for suppression.

    The atmosphere in the city was very tense after the residents of Leopoldville held demonstrations during the day on the 27th and erected barricades in the streets at night. Today, the cars of colonialists passing on the street were attacked with stones, the streets were full of broken bricks and tiles, and the windows of a building that served as a social center for veterans were completely shattered. The police, equipped only with batons, were at a disadvantage in the face of the large-scale demonstration crowds. The colonial authorities then dispatched troops. Since the 27th, another three hundred Africans have been arrested.

    Recently, in order to disperse the strength of the Congolese people, the colonial authorities attempted to force the 30,000 unemployed Congolese to leave Leopoldville by checking residence permits, detaining those without permits, and then expelling them. However, this measure was simply impossible to implement because the Congolese people constantly gathered, dispersed, and emerged in the eight-mile-long African residential area.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 28th: Leopoldville news: The Congolese people are supporting the Congolese nationalists arrested by the Belgian colonial authorities.

    It is reported that a large-scale fundraising campaign is underway to raise funds to pay the lawyers' fees for defending the arrested leaders of the "Abako" association and to help their families. So far, nineteen leaders of the Congolese nationalist organization "Abako" association have been arrested.

    Rumors are circulating that a strike may occur among workers at the oil refinery in the Kivu region of Congo.

    After new acts of resistance occurred in Leopoldville on the 27th, the police arrested another six people. (Attached picture)

    刚果人民反殖民主义斗志不屈
    首府居民筑起街垒反击比利时当局的野蛮镇压
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：利奥波德维尔一部分非洲人27日晚上不顾殖民当局实施的宵禁，在两条主要街道上匆匆筑起了街垒，然后用石头和金属碎片扔向武装巡逻队。
    那天白天发生新的反抗行动以后，刚果首府殖民当局曾经出动摩托化巡逻队加以镇压。但一当暮色降临，许多非洲人就从他们家里悄悄地走出来，用树枝、旧家具、草席、破瓶子，在两条主要道路之间，迅速地筑成街垒。他们一做完工作就走。当警察经过的时候，他们就从家里用石头和其他东西扔这些警察。
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首府利奥波德维尔人民今天再次展开反抗行动，比利时殖民当局竟出动武装部队，用步枪代替警棍来进行镇压。
    利奥波德维尔居民27日白天举行示威和晚上在街道上筑起街垒以后，这个城市的气氛十分紧张。今天在街上驶过的殖民者的汽车都受到石头的攻击，街道上满是碎砖烂瓦，有一幢作为退伍军人社交中心的房子的玻璃窗全被打碎。仅仅配备警棍的警察在声势浩大的示威群众前面处于劣势。殖民当局就出动了军队。自从27日以来，又有三百个非洲人被逮捕。
    最近，殖民当局为了分散刚果人民的力量，企图强迫登记失业的三万个刚果人离开利奥波德维尔，办法是检查居留证，没有证件的就加以扣留然后把他们赶走。但是，这项措施简直无法执行，因为刚果人不断聚散出没在有八英里长的非洲人住区里。
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果人民正在声援被比利时殖民当局逮捕的刚果民族主义者。
    据报道，一个大规模的募款运动正在进行，以便募集款项，支付为被捕的“阿巴科”协会领导人辩护的律师费用，并帮助他们的家属。到目前为止，刚果民族主义组织“阿巴科”协会已有十九个领导人被捕。
    传闻在刚果基支维特地方的炼油厂的工人可能发生罢工。
    在27日利奥波德维尔发生新的反抗行动后，警察又逮捕了六个人。（附图片）
    一月四日利奥波德维尔人民在击败了比利时殖民当局的进攻后欢呼胜利。
