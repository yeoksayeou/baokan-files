    Combining Collective and Decentralized Manure Accumulation

    From now until the start of spring plowing, this period is an important season for accumulating and creating fertilizer. Whether this year's summer harvest crops and spring-sown crops can obtain enough fertilizer depends on the efforts of these few months. Recently, many people's communes have placed this matter on the important agenda, seriously studying it, and quickly launched a new fertilizer accumulation and creation movement. This matter is being grasped at the right time. It is hoped that people's communes in various places can seize the opportunity and vigorously grasp fertilizer work.

    Everyone hopes that agricultural production in 1959 can achieve a greater leap forward, but a greater leap forward requires greater material guarantees, and fertilizer is a very important aspect of this guarantee. Now, every people's commune should calculate the fertilizer account with its members, see how much fertilizer must be prepared to achieve this year's leap forward target, how much has been prepared now, how much is still lacking, and how to quickly prepare the missing fertilizer to timely supply the various crops with the necessary "nutrients." In order to complete this task, it is particularly important to mobilize the fertilizer accumulation enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

    The problem encountered in this year's fertilizer work is how to obtain more and better fertilizer when labor is needed in all aspects. This requires the establishment of specialized fertilizer teams on the basis of unified labor arrangement. Each people's commune should transfer enough labor to form a strong professional fertilizer accumulation team. This is the main force for accumulating and creating fertilizer. But relying solely on this professional team is not enough. Because the scope of fertilizer accumulation and creation activities is very wide, it has both a concentrated and a decentralized aspect; it sometimes requires a concentrated effort, but more often it requires regularity. Precisely because of this, every household, men, women, old and young, can contribute a part of their strength to fertilizer accumulation. For example, collecting manure from scattered livestock and poultry, collecting ashes from public canteens and households, cleaning toilets, picking up manure, etc., all need to be done by the broad masses of commune members. Regular fertilizer accumulation work can often be combined with people's own work, such as keepers can also do part of the collection of pen manure, cooks can collect pen manure in conjunction with canteen pig raising work, and can also be in charge of the collection and treatment of plant ash, and so on. This shows that the potential for labor in fertilizer accumulation is very large, and these forces should be quickly mobilized, organized, and put into the fertilizer accumulation movement.

    In order to mobilize everyone's enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation, in addition to conducting serious ideological education for commune members, necessary systems should also be established in terms of business management, and practical methods should be formulated. When Taolian People's Commune in Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, began rectifying the commune, the commune members requested that the land cultivated by the production team be quickly fixed to facilitate fertilizer accumulation. After the commune initially established a system of collective and individual production responsibility and divided the land responsible for cultivation by each production team, the commune members' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation greatly increased, and they dug mud and smoked soil everywhere to engage in large-scale fertilizer accumulation. In addition, some people's communes have also given appropriate remuneration and rewards for fertilizer accumulation by each household, which is beneficial to encouraging commune members' enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation.

### 把集体积肥和分散积肥结合起来

    把集体积肥和分散积肥结合起来
    从现在起到春耕开始这一段时间，正是积肥造肥的重要季节。今年的夏收作物和春播作物能不能得到足够的肥料，就看这几个月的努力如何。最近不少人民公社把这件事提到重要的议程上来，认真地加以研究，很快地掀起了一个新的积肥造肥运动。这件事抓得很是时候。希望各地人民公社都能看准时机，大抓肥料工作。
    谁都希望1959年的农业生产能有一个更大的跃进，可是更大的跃进需有更大的物质保证，肥料就是这个保证中的很重要的一个方面。现在每一个人民公社都应当同社员算一算肥料的帐，看看要实现今年的跃进指标必需准备多少肥料，现在已经准备了多少，还缺多少，怎样才能把缺的肥料很快地备足，及时供给各种作物所需要的“给养”。为了完成这项任务，特别要把广大社员的积肥积极性调动起来。
    今年的肥料工作遇到的问题，是如何在各方面都要劳动力的情况下，取得又多又好的肥料。这就必须在统一安排劳动力的基础上建立肥料专业队。每个人民公社都应当抽调足够的劳动力组成强大的专业积肥队伍。这是积肥造肥的主力。但是光依靠这一支专业队伍还不够。因为积肥造肥活动的范围很广泛，它既有集中的一面，又有分散的一面；它有时需要突击，但更需要经常。正因为这样，家家户户、男女老少都可以在积肥方面出一部分力量。比如收集分散饲养的家畜家禽的粪便、收集公共食堂和各家各户的草木灰、打扫厕所、拾粪等等，就需要由广大社员动手来做。经常性的积肥工作，常常可以跟人们本身的工作相结合，比如饲养员可以兼做一部分收集圈肥的工作，炊事员可以结合食堂养猪工作收集圈肥，还可以兼管草木灰的收集和处理等等。这说明，在积肥方面劳动力的潜力是很大的，应当赶快把这些力量调动起来，组织起来，投入积肥运动中去。
    为了把大家积肥的积极性调动起来，除了要认真地向社员进行思想教育外，还应当在经营管理方面建立必要的制度，订出切实可行的办法。江西省龙南县桃濂人民公社开始整社的时候，社员们要求迅速固定生产队耕种的土地，便于积肥。当公社初步建立了集体和个人的生产责任制，划分了各生产队负责耕种的土地以后，社员们对积肥的责任感和积极性大大提高，到处挖泥熏土大搞积肥。此外，有些人民公社还就各家各户积肥给予适当报酬和奖励的办法，这对于鼓励社员的积肥积极性，是有好处的。
