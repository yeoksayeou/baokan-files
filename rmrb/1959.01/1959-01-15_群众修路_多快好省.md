The Masses Build Roads: More, Faster, Better, and More Economical
Zhao Cong, Secretary of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    In 1958, the people of Henan not only created great achievements on the grain and steel front, but also wrote a new chapter on the transportation front. Since September, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Henan organized a road-building army of nearly 200,000 people. After four months of hard work, they basically completed the double-tracking project of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway within Henan Province, from Zhengzhou to Lijiazhai, a total length of 322 kilometers.

    Mobilizing the masses to build railways is the inevitable result of the development of the situation. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, such as steel, coal, machinery, and grain, the railway transportation industry, as a continuation of production, faced a situation of non-adaptation. The rapid growth of steel production resulted in a sharp increase in the volume of materials required for transportation, and it was mainly concentrated on several main lines, with the Beijing-Guangzhou line being particularly prominent. Taking the section from Luohe to Xinyang as an example, if the downward transport volume in January 1958 is taken as 100%, the transport volume in October increased sharply to more than 300%, which is more than the total transport volume for the entire year of 1951. In this situation, we started by tapping the internal transport potential of the railway and launched a "car contribution campaign" centered on improving efficiency, which achieved very good results. However, we also realized that, in the long run, while tapping the internal transport potential of the railway, if we do not immediately start building some new railways, it will inevitably affect the greater leap forward in industry and agriculture. Therefore, the task of building the Beijing-Guangzhou double track at high speed was brought to our attention under the pressure of the situation.

    The current 300-kilometer-long Beijing-Guangzhou double track to be built must traverse the intersection of the Dabie Mountains and the Tongbai Mountains, cross many rivers and low-lying, flood-prone areas, and be constructed in the most congested section of transportation, so there are many difficulties. At the same time, construction on such a long line will inevitably involve a series of arrangements at the local level, such as the issue of railway land acquisition and demolition, the issue of river networking, the issue of local transportation planning, and the layout of some local industries. These problems cannot be solved by the railway department alone. In this situation, after repeated consideration, we believe that the only way is to rely on the strong strength of the people's communes under the direct leadership of the local Party committees, launch a mass movement, and resolutely implement the mass line. Only in this way can we overcome the difficulties of insufficient construction force and ensure high-speed construction; only in this way can we combine railway construction with local construction, implement unified planning, and make overall arrangements.

    The policy of running railways by following the mass line has gradually developed through a process from bottom to top and from point to surface. In this regard, Xuchang Prefecture first gained experience. Under the difficult conditions of continuous autumn rain, the Prefectural Party Committee Secretary personally took charge, mobilized 45,000 laborers, and fought hard for seven days to complete the double-track roadbed project from Guanting to Renhe, with a total length of 95 kilometers, and initially explored a set of methods for the people's communes to be responsible for building railways in sections. Immediately afterwards, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial transportation meeting, affirmed the experience of Xuchang, studied the planning of new railways, and formulated specific measures on land acquisition and demolition, migrant worker life, tool use, and raw material supply, further implementing the policy of the masses building railways. After this meeting, each special district and relevant city and county established or improved the railway construction headquarters and general headquarters, and the mobilized road-building migrant workers in the province reached 130,000, with a maximum of nearly 200,000.

    At that time, organizing and leading such a large-scale mass movement was inexperienced. Also, some comrades in the railway were accustomed to the old methods of building railways, believing that railway construction has always been the business of professional departments. They were skeptical about mobilizing the masses to build railways, believing that the masses did not understand technology, the quality of the project could not be guaranteed, and they were worried that the work surface was too large, which would cause chaos. At the same time, a small number of comrades working in local areas and some of the masses also had a mysterious view of the railway, and they still lacked sufficient understanding of the relationship between the transportation industry and industrial and agricultural production. In response to these ideological situations, under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the local, municipal, and county Party committees, a rectification-style airing and debate was launched. The main content of the debate was: Should railway construction rely solely on railway professional departments, or should we boldly mobilize the masses to do it themselves? At the same time, among the broad masses of the people, a debate was also launched on the issue of whether road construction would affect industrial and agricultural production. This debate was very lively. In the Xinyang area alone, the masses posted more than 5 million big-character posters during the debate. Through the great debate, the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses inside and outside the railway was greatly improved. They realized that the cause of the whole people and the needs of the whole people must be handled by the whole people, and only the whole people can do it well. They also realized that, in the long run, organizing a large number of laborers to build roads would not affect industrial and agricultural production, but would further promote the leap forward of industry and agriculture. With these understandings, coupled with in-depth and extensive publicity and mobilization, cadres and the masses were full of confidence and enthusiasm, and made many moving deeds.

    Once the masses are mobilized, their actions are rapid, which will inevitably cause a series of new problems in relevant aspects and within the railway. For example, how to supply machinery and raw materials in time as construction progresses rapidly; how to combine a large-scale mass movement with the provision of full technical guidance; how to combine the crash construction of hundreds of thousands of troops with proper construction preparation; and how to minimize interference with the transportation of the old line when building the double track. To solve these problems, it is inevitable to clash with the old ideas, methods, and systems of railway construction in the past. In order to provide the necessary technology for the mass construction teams, we broke the old habit of engineering and technical personnel sitting in the office. Most of them went to various construction sites, took charge of sections, conducted roving guidance, and provided key assistance, and operated independently under the direct leadership of the local Party committees. In order to help the masses master the construction technology as soon as possible, we put forward the slogan of "popularizing foreign terms, popularizing science, and popularizing technology," breaking the old method of training before construction, learning while doing, and going from simple to complex. At the same time, we also widely established on-site red and expert schools and held nearly 200 on-site technical experience exchange meetings, training a group of technical backbones. In order to strengthen the construction management work, under the direct leadership of the local Party committees, we concentrated the county and township cadres, railway cadres, and cadres who led the migrant workers, and implemented "four unifications" (that is, unified leadership, unified tasks, unified forces, and unified inspection) and "five fixings" (that is, fixing tasks, fixing personnel, fixing time, fixing tools, and fixing quality). In order to gradually reduce the labor intensity of the migrant workers, we launched a mass-based technical revolution and put forward 1,577,700 rationalization proposals. The advanced tools successfully trial-produced in the Xinyang area reached more than 145,000 pieces. In order to reduce the interference of double-track construction on the transportation of the old line, under the circumstances of the very tight transportation on the Zhengzhou-Hankou line, we broke the old rules of unloading cars in the interval, and unloaded all 580,000 tons and 280 trains of steel rails, sleepers, wood, cement, and sand and gravel to various stations, and then organized the masses to transport them to the construction site by the method of "ants moving Mount Tai." In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of a large number of machinery and raw materials, we implemented the method of combining "indigenous" and "foreign," and combining large and small. In addition to a portion of large machinery and raw materials being allocated by the state, the rest were collected locally as much as possible, and mutual assistance and cooperation were organized between relevant departments and regions.

    What are the benefits of mobilizing the masses to build railways? Through this period of practice, we feel that the following points are worth special mention: First, by mobilizing the masses to build roads, the direct leadership of the local, municipal, and county Party committees over railway construction was strengthened, and the understanding of the importance of railway transportation and construction by Party committees at all levels, various departments, and the broad masses of the people was improved. This time, the Xinyang area dispatched 691 cadres for road construction, including 13 county Party committee secretaries, county heads, and mayors, and 156 district and township Party committee secretaries and district and township heads. With this leadership force on such a long and dispersed road construction site, it provided an important guarantee for better completion of the railway construction task. In the past, when building the An(yang)-Zheng(zhou) double track with a total length of 174 kilometers, the method of employing railway professional workers plus contract workers was used, which took 18 months. Now, building the Zheng(zhou)-Li(jiazhai) double track with a total length of 322 kilometers only takes about four months because the masses are mobilized to do it, and the efficiency has increased sevenfold. As for comparing the current speed of railway construction with the speed of road construction in old China, the difference is even greater. Taking the Shihe Bridge as an example, the old bridge was supervised by five French engineers and took two years to barely complete. The new bridge only has one technician, one foreman, and two road workers responsible for technical guidance, and it can be completed in only two months. Under the current circumstances of insufficient supply of machinery and raw materials and transportation difficulties, mobilizing the masses to build railways can take materials locally and give full play to the potential of local materials. According to incomplete statistics from the Xinyang area, the various counties and townships produced more than 300,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel, more than 100,000 cubic meters of stone, more than 540,000 blue bricks, more than 3,000 cubic meters of wood, more than 30 tons of cement, and more than 6,000 kilograms of explosives. Xuchang Prefecture specially established a ballast factory for railway construction, which can produce more than 1 million cubic meters of ballast every year. At the same time, it mobilized more than 14,980 large and small vehicles and more than 133,250 tools, which not only solved the difficulties of collecting and transporting machinery and raw materials, but also saved a large amount of investment for the country. From the perspective of cooperating with local construction, through the construction of railways by the masses, railway construction is combined with farmland water conservancy construction and urban construction, taking into account overall planning and comprehensive utilization, and achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. Xuchang County combined the construction of the double track, turning the soil extraction pits into ponds, which can store 220,000 cubic meters of water, and turning the grass ditches into rice fields, expanding the cultivated land area by about 1,000 acres. Luohe City turned the soil extraction pits into artificial lakes, creating conditions for establishing a park. Xuchang Prefecture also combined railway construction with highway construction, river networking, and greening layout, made overall planning, and started to place high-yield fields near the railway. Finally, the construction of railways by the masses liberates railway construction work from the narrow circle monopolized by professional departments, and is also a profound revolution in the original leadership methods, organizational forms, and rules and regulations of the railway. It will inevitably cause a series of chain reactions within the railway. In the process of breaking the old and establishing the new, it will promote the continuous leap forward of the railway construction industry along a wider road.

    In short, the benefits of mobilizing the masses to build railways are indeed difficult to describe completely. An old farmer in Xuchang area compiled a ballad and sang: "The old man has lived ninety-three years, and it is really rare for the people to build railways. In the past, railway construction relied on foreign experts, but this time it is built by peasants; in the past, railway construction took several years, but this time it only takes dozens of days; in the past, railway construction destroyed a lot of land, but this time railway construction has changed rice paddies; in the past, railway construction was not flat, but this time it is built very beautifully. It is a good way for the whole people to build roads, and a happy life is boundless."

    群众修路　多快好省
    中共郑州铁路局委员会书记  赵聪
    1958年，河南人民不仅在粮食和钢铁战线上创造了伟大的成绩，而且，在交通运输战线上，同样写下了新的一页。9月以来，河南人民在党的领导下，组织了近二十万人的修路大军，经过四个月的奋战，基本上完成了河南境内郑州到李家寨全长三百二十二公里的京广铁路复线修建工程。
    发动群众修铁路，是形势发展的必然结果。在钢铁、煤炭、机械、粮食等工农业生产飞跃发展的情况下，作为生产继续的铁路运输业，出现了不相适应的局面。钢铁产量迅速增长的结果，所需物资运量激增，而且主要集中在几条干线上，京广干线更为突出。以漯河到信阳这一段为例，如以1958年1月份的下行运量为百分之百，到10月份运量便猛增到300％以上，比1951年全年的运量还要多。在这种情况下，我们从挖掘铁路内部运输潜力入手，开展了以提高效率为中心的“献车运动”，取得了很好的效果；但我们也认识到，以长远来看，在挖掘铁路内部运输潜力的同时，如果不立即动手修建一些新的铁路，势必影响工农业的更大跃进。于是，高速度地修建京广复线的课题，便在形势的压力下提到我们面前来了。
    现在所修的这一段三百多公里长的京广复线，要穿越大别山和桐柏山的交叉地带，跨过许多河流和低洼易涝地区，而且是在运输最紧张的地段施工，困难是不少的。同时，在如此漫长的线路上施工，必然要牵连到地方上一系列的安排，如铁路占地拆迁的问题、河网化的问题、地方交通规划的问题以及部分地方工业的布局问题等等。而这些问题，又不是铁路部门自己解决得了的。在这种情况下，我们反复考虑的结果，认为：唯一的办法就是在各地党委的直接领导下，依靠人民公社的雄厚力量，大搞群众运动，坚决贯彻群众路线。只有如此，才能克服施工力量不足的困难，保证高速度施工；才能把铁路建设和地方建设结合起来，实行统一规划，统筹安排。
    走群众路线办铁路的方针，是经历了由下到上、由点到面的过程而逐步发展起来的。在这方面，许昌地区首先取得了经验。他们在秋雨连绵的困难条件下，地委书记亲自挂帅，动员四万五千民工，奋战七天，完成了官亭至人和全长九十五公里的复线路基工程，并且初步摸索了一套人民公社分段负责修铁路的办法。紧接着，省委召开了全省交通运输会议，肯定了许昌的经验，研究了新建铁路规划，制定了有关占地拆迁、民工生活、工具使用、原材料供应等方面的具体措施，进一步贯彻了群众修铁路的方针。在这次会议以后，各专区及有关市、县都建立或健全了铁路建设指挥部和总队部，全省动员起来的修路民工达十三万人，最多时近二十万人。
    当时，把这样声势浩大的群众运动组织领导好，是缺乏经验的，也由于铁路上有一些同志，习惯于老一套的修路办法，认为从来修铁路都是专业部门的事，他们对发动群众来修铁路抱怀疑态度，认为群众不懂技术，工程质量无法保证，耽心工作面太大，会出乱子；同时，少数作地方工作的同志和部分群众对铁路也有神秘观点，对交通运输业和工农业生产之间的关系也还缺乏足够的认识。针对这些思想情况，在省委和各地、市、县委的领导下，用整风的精神，展开了鸣放辩论。辩论的主要内容是：筑铁路是单纯依靠铁路专业部门来办呢，还是放手发动群众自己来办？同时，在广大人民群众中，也围绕修路会不会影响工农业生产的问题，展开了辩论。这场辩论十分热烈，仅信阳专区的群众在辩论过程中张贴的大字报便达五百多万张。通过大辩论，大大地提高了路内外干部群众的思想觉悟，认识到全民的事业，全民的需要，必须要由全民来办，也只有全民才能办得好；认识到从长远来看，组织大批劳动力修路不是影响了工农业生产，而是更加促进了工农业的跃进。有了这些认识，再加上深入广泛的宣传鼓动，干部群众个个信心百倍，干劲冲天，做出了许多动人的事迹。
    群众一旦发动起来，行动迅速，必然会在有关方面以及铁路内部引起一系列的新问题。例如，施工进展迅速，机具、原材料如何及时供应的问题；声势浩大的群众运动如何与提供充分的技术指导相结合的问题；几十万大军突击施工如何与妥善的施工准备相结合的问题；以及修建复线如何尽量减少对旧线运输的干扰问题等等。要解决这些问题，必然要和过去的那一套修建铁路的思想、方法、制度发生冲突。为了给群众施工队伍提供必要的技术，我们破除了工程技术人员坐办公室的旧习惯，多数人下到各个工地，分段负责，巡回指导，重点协助，在当地党委的直接领导下独立作战。为了帮助群众尽快地掌握施工技术，我们提出了“洋名词通俗化，科学普及化，技术群众化”的口号，突破了先培训后施工的老办法，边干边学，由简到繁；同时还普遍建立了工地红专学校和开了近两百次现场技术经验交流会，训练了一批技术骨干；为了加强施工管理工作，在当地党委的直接领导下，把县、乡干部、铁路干部、带民工的干部集中起来，实行了“四统一”（即统一领导，统一任务，统一力量，统一检查）、“五定”（即定任务，定人员，定时间，定工具，定质量）。为了逐步减轻民工的劳动强度，发动群众大闹技术革命，提出合理化建议达一百五十七万七千余条，信阳地区试制成功的先进工具便达十四万五千余件。为了减少复线施工对旧线运输的干扰，在郑汉线运输十分紧张的情况下，我们破除了区间卸车的陈规，把五十八万吨、二百八十列车的钢轨、枕木、木料、水泥、砂石等全部卸到各个车站，然后用“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法组织群众运到工地；为了解决大量机具、原材料供应不足的困难，实行了“土”、“洋”结合，大、小并举的办法，除一部分大型机具和原材料由国家调拨外，其余都尽量就地采集，并组织有关部门及各地区之间互助协作。
    发动群众修铁路的好处究竟何在？通过这一段实践，我们觉得有以下几点是值得特别提出来的：首先，通过发动群众修路，加强了各地、市、县委对铁路建设工作的直接领导，提高了各级党委、各个部门以及广大人民群众对铁路运输及建设工作重要性的认识。这次信阳专区为修路而抽调的干部达六百九十一名，包括县委书记、县长、市长十三名，区、乡党委书记和区、乡长一百五十六名。在如此漫长、分散的筑路工地上，有了这支领导力量，就为更好地完成铁路建设任务提供了重要的保证。过去修建全长一百七十四公里的安
  （阳）郑（州）复线时，采用铁路专业工人加合同工的办法，前后用了十八个月的时间，现在修建全长三百二十二公里的郑
  （州）李（家寨）复线，由于发动群众来办，只需要大约四个月左右的时间，效率提高了七倍。至于把现在修建铁路的速度和旧中国修路的速度加以比较，更是相差千里。以溮河大桥为例，旧桥由五个法国工程师监造，历时两年才勉强完工；新桥只有一名技术员一名领工员和两名路工负责技术指导，只要两个月的时间就可建成。在当前机具、原材料供应不足、运输困难的情况下，发动群众修铁路，就可以就地取材，发挥了地方物资的潜力。据信阳专区不完全的统计，各县、乡自己生产的砂石便达三十余万方，石料十余万方，青砖五十四万余块，木材三千余方，水泥三十余吨，炸药六千余公斤。许昌专区专门为修建铁路建立了石碴厂，每年可生产石碴一百多万立方；同时，还动员了大小车辆一万四千九百八十余部，工具十三万三千二百五十余件，这不仅解决了机具、原材料的筹集和运输的困难，而且还为国家节约了大批投资。从配合地方建设来看，通过群众修铁路，把铁路建设和农田水利建设、城市建设结合了起来，统筹兼顾，综合利用，收到了一举数得的效果。许昌县结合修建复线，变取土坑为水塘，可蓄水二十二万方，变草沟为稻田，扩大耕地面积约一千多亩。漯河市把取土坑变为人工湖，为建立公园创造了条件。许昌专区也将铁路建设和公路建设、河网化、绿化布局等结合在一起，作了全面规划，并着手将丰产田摆在铁路附近。最后，群众修铁路，把铁路建设工作从专业部门包办的狭窄圈子里解放出来，也是对铁路原来那一套领导方法、组织形式、规章制度的深刻革命，它必将引起铁路内部一系列的连锁反应，在破旧立新的过程中，促进铁路建设事业沿着更宽广的道路不断跃进。
    总之，发动群众修铁路的好处确实是难以尽述的。许昌地区的一个老农民编了一首歌谣唱道：“老汉活了九十三，民办铁路真稀罕。过去修路靠洋专，这次修路庄稼汉；过去修路修几年，这次修路几十天；过去修路毁地多，这次修路改稻田；过去修路不平整，这次修得真美观。全民修路办法好，幸福生活乐无边。”
