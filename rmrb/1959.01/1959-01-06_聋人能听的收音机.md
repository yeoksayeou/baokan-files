    Radio for the Deaf
    Huang Haigen of the Shanghai Radio Company has recently created a four-use radio that can be used by the deaf.
    This five-tube radio is equipped with a neural hearing aid. In addition to being used by the general public, the deaf can clearly hear various programs by placing the neural hearing aid on their head so that it touches the nerves. If the deafness is too severe and the eardrum nerves are damaged, they can still listen by placing the neural hearing aid on the nerves of a good tooth. The neural hearing aid can also be used as a hearing aid for the deaf.
    The Shanghai Radio Company has now begun supplying this radio. The retail price is more than 160 yuan per unit.

    聋人能听的收音机
    上海无线电行黄海根最近创造了一种聋子能听的四用收音机。
    这种五灯的收音机装有神经听觉器，除一般人可以收听以外，聋人把神经听觉器放在头部使它接触神经，就可以清楚地听到各种节目。如聋的成度过重，耳膜神经已坏，把神经听觉器放在好的牙齿神经上，也能收听。神经听觉器还可作为聋人的助听器。
    现在，上海无线电行已开始供应这种收音机。每只零售价一百六十多元。
