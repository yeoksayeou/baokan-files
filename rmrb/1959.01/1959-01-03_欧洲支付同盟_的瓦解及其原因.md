    The Collapse of the "European Payments Union" and its Reasons

    Editor's Note: The "European Payments Union" has collapsed after countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany announced the implementation of free currency convertibility.

    To further understand this event, readers have raised many questions to the editorial department. They ask what kind of organization this institution, which has been in existence for more than eight years, actually is, what its background is, and why it suddenly collapsed after its participating countries implemented free currency convertibility? The answers to these questions are as follows:

    The "European Payments Union" was established in July 1950. It was formed under the instigation of the United States by the seventeen member countries of the "European Organization for Economic Co-operation" that joined the "Marshall Plan." They are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany , Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and Turkey. This organization is directly under the leadership of the "European Organization for Economic Co-operation" in its administrative system. Formally, it is an organization similar to a clearing bank, with a credit fund that can provide loans to member countries experiencing trade payment difficulties. Part of the fund comes from "Marshall Plan" aid, and the vast majority is shared by member countries proportionally. The main activity of this organization is to conduct monthly settlements of trade between member countries, calculate surpluses (i.e., international trade surpluses) and deficits (i.e., international trade deficits), and then have member countries clear them through the "European Payments Union." Each member country's surplus or deficit is subject to certain limits (roughly 15% of their respective total trade with other participating countries in 1949). If a deficit occurs and is within the limit, 75% (50% before 1955) must be paid by the deficit country to the other party in gold or US dollars, and the remaining 25% (50% before 1955) can be temporarily unpaid and retained by the other party as a credit loan. If the limit is exceeded, the excess must be paid in full in gold or US dollars.

    How was this complicated method produced, and what contradictions was it used to solve?

    Originally, after World War II, the economies of Western European countries were on the verge of bankruptcy, and currency systems were generally unstable. In order to compete for foreign markets and protect domestic markets, they had to implement strict trade and foreign exchange restrictions, which made it difficult for them to expand trade with each other and made it extremely difficult for the United States to enter the Western European market. At the same time, because the pound sterling was no longer freely convertible in Europe, and Europe generally lacked gold and US dollars for multilateral trade, a situation arose in which Western European countries lacked a common international means of circulation in trade, causing even greater economic difficulties. At that time, the United States, which was vigorously promoting the "Marshall Plan" in Western Europe, took advantage of the difficulties of the Western European countries and proposed that it provide a fund of 350 million US dollars to establish such an organization as the "European Payments Union" to solve the difficulties of Western European countries lacking trade payment methods and promote the "liberalization" of trade. At that time, Western European countries were willing to accept this arrangement in order to avoid excessive dependence on US aid and get rid of the trade stalemate. Therefore, from the beginning, the "European Payments Union" was a unified entity full of contradictions: the United States wanted to use it to strengthen its control over the economies of Western European countries, while Western European countries wanted to use it to ease trade contradictions with each other and reduce their dependence on the United States.

    Under these circumstances, where everyone had different dreams and plans, the "European Payments Union" continued to exist year after year. On the one hand, the United States relied on this institution to control the foreign trade and foreign exchange payments of Western European countries, making it difficult for them to trade with socialist countries. On the other hand, Western European countries did solve some of their trade difficulties through this institution. However, this "union" did not and could not eliminate the contradictions between Western European countries in competing for markets. On the contrary, in the first year of the "European Payments Union" (July 1950 to June 1951), these countries launched a fierce struggle for markets. Britain and France initially gained an absolute advantage in the trade war and once became the largest trade surplus countries in the "Union." However, in the second year (July 1951 to June 1952), they were at a disadvantage and were surpassed by Belgium, Sweden and Italy. Later, West Germany surpassed Belgium and Sweden to become the largest trade surplus country in the "Union." Under this fierce struggle, some countries with weak competitiveness suffered huge losses of gold and foreign exchange due to continuous trade deficits, and had to violate the "trade liberalization" provisions of this "Union" and strengthen import restrictions. The trade surplus countries also gradually felt that their interests were being damaged because they had to continuously provide credit loans to the deficit countries in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the centrifugal force of the "European Payments Union" increased day by day. Its member countries later prepared to gradually end this "Union" when conditions were ripe and their economic strength permitted free currency convertibility. For example, in January 1955, the Council of Ministers of the "European Organization for Economic Co-operation" had discussed the issue of free currency convertibility in Western European countries. In August 1955, they also signed the "European Monetary Agreement," agreeing that the "European Payments Union" would be dissolved as long as the currencies of more than half of the member countries could be freely converted. However, at the same time, they also decided to maintain this "Union" when everyone's strength was insufficient.

    Then, does the sudden announcement by Britain, France, West Germany and other countries to implement free currency convertibility indicate that their strength is sufficient? The fact is not at all like this. Except for West Germany, most Western European countries' foreign exchange reserves are still far from being able to implement free convertibility. Britain needs at least 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars in gold and dollar reserves to implement limited free convertibility, but when it announced the implementation of limited free convertibility of the pound this time, its foreign exchange reserves were only 3.2 billion US dollars. France has even less, only 400 to 600 million US dollars. So why are they so eager to break up and take the risk? The answer is: Under the shadow of the economic crisis in the capitalist world, West Germany and six other countries established the Western European "Common Market," but rejected Britain's proposal for a "free trade zone," which has seriously threatened Britain's foreign trade. In order to compete with France and West Germany for markets, Britain had to take a desperate gamble and implement free convertibility of the pound to launch a trade counterattack.

    However, Britain's move did not make France yield. On the contrary, after weighing the pros and cons, the de Gaulle government has embarked on the road that Britain fears it will take the most, that is, relying on West Germany and the United States to undermine Britain. At present, France has not only formed an alliance with West Germany, but also obtained new loans from the latter to stabilize the devalued franc.

    As early as early June 1958, some bourgeois newspapers in Western countries worried that the economic crisis would cause Western "international economic cooperation institutions to disintegrate." And now the collapse of the "European Payments Union" just shows that this disintegration has begun.

### “欧洲支付同盟”的瓦解及其原因

    “欧洲支付同盟”的瓦解及其原因
    编者按：在英、法、西德等国宣布实行货币自由兑换之后，“欧洲支付同盟”瓦解了。
    读者为了进一步了解这个事件，向编辑部提出了很多问题，他们问这个成立已有八年多的机构究竟是怎样一种性质的组织，它产生的背景如何，为什么在它的参加国实行货币自由兑换之后它就突然宣告垮台呢？对于这些问题，答复如后：
    “欧洲支付同盟”成立于1950年7月。它是在美国授意下由加入“马歇尔计划”的“欧洲经济合作局”十七个成员国所组成。它们是：奥地利、比利时、丹麦、法国、西德、希腊、冰岛、爱尔兰、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威、葡萄牙、瑞典、瑞士、英国和土耳其。这个组织在行政系统上直接归“欧洲经济合作局”领导。形式上，它是一个类似清算银行的组织，设有一笔信贷基金，可以向发生贸易支付困难的会员国发放贷款。基金的一部分来自“马歇尔计划”的援款，绝大部分则由成员国按比例分担。这个组织的主要活动是逐月进行会员国之间贸易上的结算，统计出顺差（即国际贸易的盈余）和逆差（即国际贸易的亏欠），然后由会员国通过“欧洲支付同盟”来进行清算。每个会员国的顺差或逆差都分别规定有一定的限额（大致为它们各自在1949年同其他参加国贸易总额的15％）。如果发生逆差，而又在限额之内，则75％
  （1955年以前为50％）需由逆差国家用黄金或美元偿付对方，其余25％（1955年以前为50％）可以暂不支付，由对方作为信用贷款加以保留。如果超过限额，则超出部分必须全部用黄金或美元偿付。
    这样一套复杂办法是怎样产生的，它究竟是用来解决什么矛盾呢？
    原来第二次世界大战结束后，西欧国家经济都濒临破产，币制普遍呈现不稳。为了争取国外市场、保护国内市场，它们都不得不实行严格的贸易和外汇限制，结果使彼此在扩展贸易上寸步难行，并使美国想打入西欧市场也极为困难。同时，更由于英镑在欧洲已不能自由兑换，欧洲又普遍缺乏黄金美元来进行多边贸易，于是又出现了西欧国家彼此在贸易上缺乏共同的国际流通手段的局面，造成了经济上的更大困难。当时在西欧大力推行“马歇尔计划”的美国，为了乘机进一步控制这一地区的贸易，就利用西欧国家的困难，倡议由它提供一笔三亿五千万美元的基金来建立这样一个“欧洲支付同盟”的组织，以解决西欧国家间缺乏贸易支付手段的困难，并促进贸易的“自由化”，当时西欧国家为了避免过度依赖美援，并摆脱在贸易上所陷入的僵局，也乐意接受这一安排。因此“欧洲支付同盟”从一开始就是一个矛盾重重的统一体：美国想用它来加强对西欧国家经济的控制，而西欧国家则想通过它来缓和彼此在贸易上的矛盾，并减少对美国的依赖。
    在这种同床异梦、各有打算的情况下，“欧洲支付同盟”遂年复一年地继续存在下去。一方面，美国依靠这个机构控制了西欧国家的对外贸易和外汇支付，使它们很难同社会主义国家进行贸易，另一方面西欧国家通过这个机构也的确解决了它们在进行贸易上的一些困难。不过这个“同盟”并没有、也不可能消除西欧国家之间争夺市场的矛盾。恰正相反，在“欧洲支付同盟”成立的第一年（1950年7月到1951年6月）这些国家就展开了激烈的争夺市场的斗争。英、法在贸易战中最初取得了绝对优势，曾一度成为“同盟”中最大的贸易盈余国家。可是第二年
  （1951年7月到1952年6月）它们就处于劣势地位，而为比利时、瑞典和意大利所超越。以后西德又超越比利时和瑞典而成为“同盟”中最大的贸易盈余国。在这种激烈斗争下，一些竞争能力弱的国家因一直出现贸易亏空，损失了大量黄金外汇，从而不得不违反这个“同盟”的“贸易自由化”规定，加强了进口限制。而贸易盈余国家则因必须按照规定向亏空国家不断提供信用贷款，也渐渐感到利益受到损失。因此“欧洲支付同盟”的离心力便日益增大。它的成员国以后就准备在条件成熟、经济力量许可实行货币自由兑换时逐步结束这个“同盟”。例如1955年1月，“欧洲经济合作局”部长理事会已讨论了西欧国家货币自由兑换问题。1955年8月它们又签订了“欧洲货币协定”，彼此约定，只要半数以上成员国的货币可以自由兑换，“欧洲支付同盟”就行解散。可是同时它们也决定在大家力量不足时仍应保持这个“同盟”。
    那末，这次英、法、西德等国家突然宣布实行货币自由兑换，这是否表明它们的力量已经充足了呢？事实完全不是这样。西欧国家除西德以外，大多数国家的外汇储备目前离能够实行自由兑换的条件还很远。英国至少要有五十亿到一百亿美元的黄金美元储备才能实行有限度的自由兑换，但是在这次宣布英镑实行有限度自由兑换时，它的外汇储备只有三十二亿美元。法国则更少得可怜，只有四到六亿美元。那么为什么它们要急于散伙去挺而走险呢？答案是：在资本主义世界经济危机笼罩下，西德和法国等六个国家建立西欧“共同市场”，但却拒绝英国“自由贸易区”的建议，已经对英国的对外贸易造成严重威胁。为了同法国、西德争夺市场，英国不得不孤注一掷，实行英镑自由兑换，发动贸易反攻。
    但是，英国的这一举动并没有使法国低头，相反的，戴高乐政府在权衡利害之后，已经走上了英国所最害怕它走上的道路，这就是依靠西德和美国来挖英国的墙脚。目前法国不仅已和西德结成联盟，并且还从后者获得新的贷款，以稳定贬值后的法郎。
    还在1958年6月初，西方国家的一些资产阶级报刊就担心经济危机会使西方的“国际经济合作机构走向解体”。而现在“欧洲支付同盟”的瓦解，正好说明了这一解体已经开始。
