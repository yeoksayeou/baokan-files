Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 15th: The first winter after the rural communization in Anhui has seen a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects of production.

By the end of last year, more than 120,000 water conservancy projects had been completed across the province, potentially increasing the irrigated area by 80,000 mu, improving irrigation for 60,000 mu, and eliminating waterlogging for 67,000 mu. This year, people's communes in various regions organized groups for manufacturing and repairing water management tools, producing more than 2 million tools for water conservancy sites, nearly double the amount of last year. A high-efficiency movement is underway everywhere, with manpower and tools being used more rationally. Since the start of construction, the construction efficiency in various regions has generally been higher than in the same period last year.

The meticulousness of field management for overwintering crops this year surpasses any previous year. In addition to establishing more than 110,000 specialized teams to continuously manage overwintering crops, many places have also organized activities for intensive watering and topdressing. Currently, fertilizer has been applied to 30 million mu of overwintering crops across the province, and the conventional practice of not irrigating overwintering crops in winter has been broken, with more than 12 million mu having been irrigated. More than 10 million mu of overwintering crops have also undergone intertillage, ditch clearing, and frost protection.

Significant progress has been made in winter fertilizer accumulation. Currently, more than 50 billion dan of various fertilizers have been accumulated, about seven times more than in the same period last year.

Combined with winter pest control, the progress of winter plowing across the province is also the fastest in history. About 85% of the more than 23 million mu of winter fallow land that should be plowed has already been plowed. People's communes mostly selected experienced veterans in deep plowing to participate in winter plowing, so plowing is generally deeper than in previous years.

Although afforestation activities across the province have only just begun, progress is also rapid. By January 9th, more than 1.8 million mu had been afforested, planting more than 500,000 mu of trees more than at this time last year. Various regions are very particular about tree species matching and planting quality.

Various winter sideline productions have been launched in various places. In the Huaibei Plain, in addition to raising a large number of livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, and chickens, various workshops for manufacturing non-staple foods have been put into busy production. In particular, workshops and factories that comprehensively utilize sweet potatoes are common in every people's commune. In the mountainous areas of southern Anhui and the Dabie Mountains, winter sideline production such as hunting, burning lime, and digging medicinal materials is also active. In the areas along the river and lake, a large number of fishing boats have been launched to catch fish and shrimp.

Although this winter's production has many contents, heavy tasks, high standards, after communization, the people's communes have exerted their advantages, so all aspects of production are done quickly and well. People's communes in various regions can not only allocate labor more rationally within the scope of the entire commune to achieve simultaneous advancement in various productions, but also have more power to solve some difficulties in production. For example, the equipment needed for large-scale water conservancy construction is mostly solved by relying on self-reliance, running factories to self-make cement, explosives, and self-burning lime, bricks, etc. The people's communes in various regions have also run canteens and nurseries on a large scale, which has also liberated a lot of female labor force, adding a huge new force to various productions.

This newspaper, Nanchang, January 15th: A massive and magnificent mass movement of winter production has already taken shape in Jiangxi province.

Currently, more than 4.5 million agricultural production troops in the province, fighting on various fronts, are selflessly fighting in the fields and mountains during the day, and actively participating in rectification at night. Many people's communes held forums and discussions to review and summarize the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, so as to make this year's agricultural production better and more skillful. At the same time, whether it is villages or water conservancy sites, there is a sound of hammers everywhere, which is to manufacture various agricultural tools to support winter production and prepare for spring plowing. Many local people's communes are using the indigenous iron they smelted themselves during last year's Great Leap Forward to manufacture agricultural tools. Recently, more than 20,000 people in Yugan County have invested in tool reform, and more than 60 new agricultural tool factories have been established, actively rushing to produce ball bearings, transportation vehicles, plows, harrows, and other tools for the labor army fighting on the water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, field management, and sideline production fronts. The members of Qianfang People's Commune in Jinxian County also proposed to realize the semi-mechanization of fertilizer accumulation and grass removal, and the vehicleization of fertilizer and soil transportation.

Under the hard work of more than 4.5 million agricultural labor troops, Jiangxi Province has achieved a great victory in the initial battle of winter production. According to the statistics as of now, the labor army engaged in water conservancy projects across the province has completed more than 180 million cubic meters of earth and stone, four times more than in the same period last year. This year, the progress of water conservancy projects in Jiangxi Province is relatively fast. In addition to the masses' high enthusiasm, good preparation, and early construction, the main reason is relying on the masses to be self-reliant, running factories at construction sites, vigorously carrying out tool reform, and launching a high-efficiency movement. In the past month or so, the water conservancy sites in various counties of Yichun Prefecture have manufactured more than 250,000 pieces of advanced water conservancy construction tools, and the work efficiency has increased from the original average of more than two cubic meters per person per day to more than ten cubic meters. This prefecture has also established more than 700 factories at water conservancy sites, and more than 70% of the materials used at each construction site are self-made. More than 1.3 million people in the province engaged in fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing have accumulated and manufactured more than 6 billion dan of fertilizer, equivalent to eight times the total amount of fertilizer accumulated and manufactured in the province in the same period last year; calculated by cultivated land area, the average fertilizer per mu has been more than 150 dan. Last year, most of the fertilizers in various places were accumulated, such as digging pond mud, etc.; although a large amount of fertilizer is still being accumulated this year, a larger amount of fertilizer is man-made. In the recent fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement in Yifeng County, special emphasis was placed on composting, manufacturing native chemical fertilizers, and burning fire soil ash. The more than 200 native chemical fertilizer factories recently built in this county have manufactured more than 90,000 jin of high-efficiency native chemical fertilizer in a few days. One million people in the province engaged in sideline production have also achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics up to the 7th, in just half a month, the income from sideline production in the province reached more than 50 million yuan.

Because the people's communes have been realized throughout Jiangxi Province, and the people's communes have fully demonstrated the great superiority of being large and public, this year's winter production is more vigorous, large-scale, fast progress, good quality, and great achievements than in previous years.

Secondly, due to last year's Great Leap Forward, especially the large-scale iron and steel production and the large-scale industrial development of people's communes, a certain material basis and technical force were provided for this year's winter production. The communes in Jinxian County used the native iron they smelted last year to manufacture agricultural tools and ball bearings, which enabled the fertilizer manufacturing movement to realize vehicleization.

Furthermore, the people of the province have greatly improved their political consciousness and encouraged the enthusiasm and determination to strive for a greater leap forward through studying the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Now the broad masses of the people are full of enthusiasm and high morale, and are full of confidence in striving to achieve a greater leap forward and a greater harvest in 1959. (Attached picture)

    安徽、江西人民公社化后的第一个冬天
    冬季生产比去冬更加出色
    水利、积肥、副业等齐头并进又快又好
    新华社合肥15日电　安徽农村公社化后的第一个冬天，出现了各项生产齐头跃进的局面。
    全省各水利工地到去年年底，就已经完成各种工程十二万多处，可以增加灌溉面积八万亩，改善灌溉面积六万亩，除涝六万七千亩。今年各地人民公社都组织了治水工具的制造、修理组，为水利工地制造了二百多万件工具，比去年多了近两倍。到处开展着高工效运动，人力、工具都进一步得到合理使用，自开工以来，各地施工效率普遍比去年同期高。
    今年越冬作物田间管理的细致，超过了以往任何一年。全省各地除了建立起十一万多个专业队，连续对越冬作物进行管理以外，很多地方还组织了突击浇水、追肥的活动。目前全省已有三千万亩越冬作物追过肥，并且打破了越冬作物不冬灌的惯例，已有一千二百多万亩浇了水。进行过中耕、清沟和防冻的越冬作物，也有一千多万亩。
    冬季积肥的成绩很显著，目前已积好各种肥料五百多亿担，比去年同期多了七倍左右。
    结合冬季治螟，全省冬耕进度也是历来最快的一年。二千三百多万亩应耕的冬板田，已经耕了85％左右。人民公社大都挑选对深耕有经验的老手来参加冬耕，因此普遍比往年耕得深。
    全省造林活动虽然还是刚刚开始，但进展也很快，到1月9日，已造林一百八十多万亩，比去年这个时候多栽树五十多万亩。各地在树种搭配、栽培质量等方面都很讲究。
    各种冬季副业生产已在各地开展起来。在淮北平原，除了大量饲养猪、羊、鸡等家畜家禽以外，各种制造副食品的作坊都已投入了繁忙的生产。特别是综合利用甘薯的作坊和工厂，更是普遍到每个人民公社。在皖南山区和大别山区，打猎、烧石灰、挖药材等冬季副业生产，也已活跃起来。沿江沿湖地区，大批的渔船已经下水捕捉鱼虾。
    尽管今年冬季生产内容多，任务大，标准高，但是公社化以后，人民公社发挥了优越性，所以各项生产都做得又快又好。各地人民公社不但在全社范围内能更合理地调配劳动力，做到各项生产齐头并进，而且也更有力量来解决生产中的一些困难。如大规模兴修水利所需要的器材，各地大都是依靠自力更生，办起工厂来自制水泥、炸药，自烧石灰、砖等来解决的。全省各地人民公社大办食堂、托儿所，也解放出了不少妇女劳动力，给各项生产增添了一支巨大的生力军。
    本报南昌15日电　一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的冬季生产的群众运动已经在江西全省形成。
    目前，奋战在各条战线上的全省四百五十多万冬季农业生产大军，正忘我地白天战斗在田野和山头，晚上，积极参加整社。许多人民公社举行座谈会、讨论会，回顾和总结1958年大跃进的成绩和经验，以便使今年的农业生产搞得更好，干得更巧。与此同时，全省各地不论是村庄还是水利工地，到处是一片锤子的铿锵声，这是在为支援冬季生产和准备春耕制造各种农具。很多地方的人民公社正在利用去年大跃进时自己炼出来的土铁制造农具。余干县最近有二万多人投入了工具改革，新成立了六十多个农具工厂，积极为战斗在水利建设、积肥造肥、田间管理和副业生产战线上的劳动大军赶制滚珠轴承、运输车辆、犁耙和其他工具。进贤县前坊人民公社的社员们还提出了要实现积肥铲草半机械化，运肥、运土车子化。
    在四百五十多万农业劳动大军的奋战下，江西省冬季生产初战已获得大捷。截至目前止的统计，全省兴修水利工程的劳动大军，已完成土石方一亿八千多万公方，比去年同期多四倍。今年江西省兴修水利工程的进度比较快，除了群众干劲足、准备工作做得好和施工较早以外，主要原因是依靠群众自力更生，工地办工厂，大搞工具改革，开展高工效运动。宜春专区各县水利工地近一个多月来，制造的水利施工先进工具计二十五万多件，工效由原来平均每人每日二方多提高到十方以上。这个专区还在水利工地上建立了七百多个工厂，各工地所用器材70％以上是自己制造的。全省一百三十多万积肥造肥大军已积肥造肥六十多亿担，相等于去年同期全省积肥造肥总数的八倍；按耕地面积计算，平均每亩地已经有肥料一百五十多担。去年各地的肥料大都是积起来的，如挖塘泥等；今年虽然也在大量积肥，但更大量的肥料是人造的。宜丰县在最近开展的积肥造肥运动中，特别强调了沤肥、制造土化肥和烧火土灰。这个县最近新建的二百多个土化肥厂几天之中就制造了九万多斤肥效高的土化肥。全省一百万人搞副业生产，也已经取得了巨大成绩。据到7日为止的不完全统计，仅仅半个月的时间，全省副业生产收入达五千多万元。
    江西由于全省实现了人民公社化，人民公社充分显示了大而公的巨大优越性，所以，今年冬季生产搞得比往年都格外轰轰烈烈，规模大、进展快、质量好、成绩大。
    其次，该省由于有去年的大跃进，尤其是大办钢铁和人民公社大办工业，为今年的冬季生产提供了一定的物质基础和技术力量。进贤县各公社用去年自己炼出的土铁制造农具和滚珠轴承，使造肥运动实现了车子化。
    再者，全省人民通过学习党的八届六中全会决议，大大提高了政治觉悟，鼓舞了争取更大跃进的干劲和决心。现在广大人民热情饱满，斗志昂扬，对争取实现1959年更大的跃进更大的丰收满怀信心。（附图片）
