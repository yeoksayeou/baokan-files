Enliven Democratic Life, Establish "Three Goods" Examples
Wangting Commune Elects Good Cadres and Good Members

(Our newspaper dispatch) Based on summarizing the achievements of the all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Wangting People's Commune in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, selected a group of "Three Goods" cadres and "Three Goods" commune members. Through the evaluation, the democratic life of the commune was enlivened, and the new atmosphere of "loving the people as family, loving the commune as home" was promoted.

After the Wangting People's Commune implemented the "Four Transformations," many model figures emerged among both cadres and the masses. In order to commend these figures and encourage other cadres and commune members to work harder and labor actively, the Wangting Commune decided to select "Three Goods" cadres and "Three Goods" commune members. The commune defined the criteria for "Three Goods" cadres as: good at labor, good at connecting with the masses, and good at implementing the Party's policies. The selection method was self-nomination and public discussion from top to bottom, evaluation from the commune to the team, and final public recognition by the masses (approved at the commune members' congress) before someone could be considered a "Three Goods" cadre. This selection method greatly educated the cadres, because the commune members knew the cadres very well, had strict requirements, and made very specific suggestions. A few cadres were once rated as "Three Goods" at the commune cadres' meeting, but were often only rated as "Two Goods" or "One Good" at the commune members' congress. And the "Three Goods" cadres who were recognized by the public were often supplemented with many specific materials by the masses during the evaluation. Xi Jirong, the production team leader of the Second Brigade, is a "Three Goods" cadre loved by the masses. In leading production, he always took the lead in everything, going to the most difficult places and doing the heaviest work. When repairing water conservancy projects in winter, he needed to go into the river to support the waterwheel. He didn't want other commune members to freeze, so he took off his cotton trousers and waded into the icy cold current. Because of his outstanding labor, his labor points were not only the most in the entire production team, but also the most in the entire brigade. Sometimes when he came back from a meeting, he would take his luggage to the field to work without sending it home first. Under his leadership, the commune members were very active and enthusiastic in their labor. His production team is a red flag team in the brigade. There are many cadres like this who are unanimously praised by the masses. This time, more than 100 "Three Goods" cadres were selected.

The criteria for "Three Goods" commune members are: good ideology, good labor, and good at protecting public property. Yang Heshang, a commune member from a poor peasant family in the Third Brigade, is such a "Three Goods" commune member. He is almost sixty years old this year, but he runs ahead of others when he works. When repairing water conservancy projects in winter, he took the lead in going into the water to dig soil and drain water; after work, he often collected small farm tools everywhere by himself. This time, about 40% of the people in the entire commune were rated as "Three Goods" commune members, and they are all the backbone forces of the commune.

The commune members were also very serious and earnest when evaluating each other. Some commune members took the initiative to examine their own shortcomings at the meeting, admitting that they were "not good at labor" or "not good at protecting public property," and expressed their determination to correct them. During the evaluation process, many commune members wrote big-character posters: some were self-criticisms, some were mutual criticisms, and some were criticisms of cadres.

This evaluation gave both cadres and commune members a profound education. Xu Asan, the production team leader of the Third Brigade, said: "The evaluation is like looking in a mirror to wash your face, clearly seeing the dirt on your face and washing it clean." After the evaluation, cadres generally participated in labor, and the working style of cadres connecting with the masses has also been greatly improved, which is well received by the masses. After Shen Jifu, the secretary of the Party branch of the First Brigade, was criticized by the masses for being somewhat rigid, he made a serious self-criticism at the meeting and corrected his shortcomings in his actual work. The masses said: After all, they are Communist Party cadres, and they correct their mistakes as soon as they are criticized.

The commune members' attitude towards labor and public property has also been greatly improved. Eight women in the Pingshan Wang Brigade of the commune were originally unwilling to go to the water conservancy construction site to work. After the evaluation, they all scrambled to sign up. The commune members welcomed this evaluation. They said: "Now eating doesn't cost money, if we don't have an evaluation, we won't know who is good and who is bad."

Now, striving to be a "Three Goods cadre" and a "Three Goods commune member" has become the goal of the vast number of cadres and commune members in the Wangting Commune. Those who have been rated as "Three Goods" are determined to maintain and carry forward their glory; those who have been rated as "Two Goods" are unwilling to be in the middle; those who have been rated as "One Good" are even more determined to correct their shortcomings.

At present, the commune Party committee has also decided to institutionalize and regularize this evaluation movement in the future, not only to evaluate at the end of the year, but also to evaluate once a month or every quarter, so that it can become an effective method to improve the masses' awareness and enliven democratic life.

### 活跃民主生活　树立“三好”榜样  望亭公社评选好干部好社员

    活跃民主生活　树立“三好”榜样
    望亭公社评选好干部好社员
    本报讯　江苏吴县望亭人民公社在总结1958年全面大跃进成绩的基础上，评选出了一批“三好”干部和“三好”社员。通过评比，活跃了公社的民主生活，发扬了“爱民如亲，爱社如家”的新风气。
    望亭人民公社实行“四化”以后，无论在干部中还是在群众中，都出现了许多模范人物。为了表彰这些人物，并鼓励其他的干部和社员更加努力做好工作，积极劳动，望亭公社确定评选“三好”干部和“三好”社员。公社把干部“三好”的条件定为劳动好，联系群众好，贯彻执行党的政策好。评选的方法是自上而下的自报公议，由社到队评比，最后经群众公认（在社员大会通过），才算是“三好”干部。这种评选的办法，对干部的教育极大，因为社员对干部很了解，要求很严格，提的意见很具体。有少数干部在公社干部会上曾被评为“三好”，但在社员大会上，往往只评为“二好”或“一好”。而被公认的“三好”的干部，群众在评选中往往会补充许多具体的材料。二大队生产队长奚纪荣就是一个群众爱戴的“三好干部”。他在领导生产中，不论做什么，都是先带头，到最艰苦的地方拣最重的活干。冬天修水利时，需要到河里去支水车，他不愿别的社员受冻，自己把棉裤一脱就涉到冰冷彻骨的寒流中去。因为劳动出色，他的劳动工分不仅在全生产队最多，就是在全大队也是最多的。有时开会回来，行李没送回家，他就带到地里去劳动了。在他的带动下，社员劳动都很主动、积极。他的生产队是大队的红旗队。像这样群众一致赞扬的干部很多，这次评选出的“三好”干部就有一百多名。
      “三好”社员的条件是思想好，劳动好，爱护公共财物好。三大队贫农出身的社员杨和尚，就是这样的“三好社员”。他今年将近六十岁了，干起活来却跑在别人的前面。冬天修水利时，他带头下水挖土排水；下工以后，还往往一个人到处收集小农具。这次全公社有40％左右的人被评为“三好社员”，他们都是公社的骨干力量。
    社员们在相互评选时，也很认真严肃。有些社员在会上主动检讨自己缺点，承认自己“劳动不好”或“爱护公共财物不好”，并表示坚决改正。在评选过程中，很多社员写了大字报：有自我批评的，有相互批评的，也有批评干部的。
    这次评选使干部和社员都受到了一次深刻的教育。三大队生产队长徐阿三说：“评选好像照镜子洗脸，把脸上的脏污照得清清楚楚，洗得干干净净。”评选以后，干部普遍参加了劳动，干部联系群众的工作作风也有了很大改进，群众反映很好。一大队党支部书记沈纪福被群众批评态度有些生硬以后，在会上认真地作了检讨，并且在实际工作中改正了缺点。群众说：到底是共产党的干部，有了错误一批评就改正。
    社员的劳动态度和对待公共财物的态度也有了很大改进。该社平山王大队有八个妇女，原先不愿到水利工地去劳动。评选以后，都争着报名去。社员们很欢迎这种评选。他们说：“现在吃饭不要钱，要不评比一下，谁好谁差没个数。”
    现在，争取做“三好干部”和“三好社员”已经成为望亭公社广大干部和社员的努力方向。评上“三好”的人，决心保持和发扬光荣；评上“二好”的人，不甘居中游；评上“一好”的人，更决心改正缺点。
    目前公社党委又决定今后使这种评选运动制度化和经常化，不但年终评，每月或每季都评一次，使它成为提高群众觉悟、活跃民主生活的一种有效的方法。　（鲍春光）
