　　Persisting in Running a School for Five Years: The Factory Takes on a New Look
　　Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory Solves the Relationship Between Developing Production and Running Education

　　(This newspaper report) Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory has persisted in running a workers' spare-time cultural school for five years, which has very well resolved the relationship between developing production and running the school.

　　The Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory was formed in 1953 by merging the Songjiang, Xin Sheng, and Harbin three small pharmaceutical preparation factories. At that time, the production equipment and production technology were very backward. Most of the workers were dispatchers and packaging workers from the original small pharmaceutical preparation factories. They could only produce simple medicines such as sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. Only more than 70 workers participated in the workers' spare-time cultural school, and more than 80% of the workers were illiterate. Many people, when encountering numbers with decimal points in pharmaceutical preparations, often used integers to calculate or roughly prepare, regardless of the nature of the medicine or chemical reactions. As for the proportion algorithm that is often used in preparations, even fewer people understood it. Therefore, there were relatively many production accidents, and some of the factory's products were returned in large quantities, and the production tasks could not be completed for years. At that time, the factory leaders were passive in their work, and there was not enough production time, so they squeezed out the workers' spare-time study time. In the spring of 1954, the factory leaders gradually realized in practice that to change the past backward situation, it was not only necessary to improve production technology but also to accelerate the improvement of the workers' cultural level. Then, the factory leaders immediately took measures to strengthen the leadership of teaching, mainly the workers' spare-time cultural school, and successively opened cadre training classes, chemistry classes, literature classes, and Russian classes. By 1955, the workers' cultural and technical levels had been significantly improved, and the production tasks were overfulfilled year by year.

　　Recently, this factory made full use of the cultural and educational achievements of the past five years to launch a technical revolution among the workers, which further improved production. In December of last year, the workers of the Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory put forward more than 150 rationalization proposals in half a month, more than 50 of which have been implemented, increasing production efficiency by 30% compared with the same period in November last year. Zhang Guiqin, a female worker who studied in literacy classes in 1953 and has now reached the first year of junior high school, proposed a new method of sugar-coating pills, which increased production efficiency by more than doubled. This factory also ensures the smooth progress of teaching on the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks. At present, the attendance rate of workers' spare-time cultural study has reached 96% of the number of enrolled students; according to statistics in December last year, 75% of the students received four or five points, and 25% of the students received three points.

　　The Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory regards teaching as a need for developing production and has come up with many ways to overcome many difficulties so that teaching can be adhered to for a long time. First of all, the problem of production and teaching time arrangement was solved. In 1956, the factory's production tasks doubled compared with 1955. At that time, a three-shift system was adopted in production, with machines running day and night. This squeezed out the study time of night-shift workers, and the attendance rate of workers suddenly dropped. In response to this situation, the factory leaders convened a cadre meeting and worked out a re-grouping method, assigning workers participating in spare-time cultural studies to study in the day shift and workers participating in other subjects to study in the night shift. In this way, the attendance rate of workers increased again. The second is to solve the problem of unified leadership of production and teaching. In 1957, there was a phenomenon of declining academic performance of workers. The factory leaders went to various workshops to investigate and study and found that the workshop cadres had the idea that "I am in charge of production, and running a school is the business of cultural and educational cadres." In response to this situation, the factory leaders incorporated education into the overall work plan of the Party Committee and entrusted the factory director and the chairman of the trade union to serve as the principals of the workers' spare-time school, and the workshop directors to serve as the workshop study counselors. Since then, the problem of unified leadership of production and teaching has been solved, eliminating the idea and practice of workshop cadres regarding leading teaching as "extracurricular activities." The third is to solve the problem of lack of teachers. In 1956, there were twelve teachers in the spare-time cultural school, seven of whom were hired from outside the factory. These external teachers were not familiar with the production and the students' ideological situation; it was also inconvenient for the factory to conduct ideological education and arrange work for them, and they often suspended classes due to conflicts between the work and teaching time of their own units. The factory leaders selected some workers with teaching ability from the factory and trained them as part-time teachers. Now, nineteen of the twenty teachers in the factory are part-time teachers from the factory, and only one is a full-time teacher. In addition, the specific difficulties of workers in learning and life are constantly being solved: the workshops and factory buildings of this factory are scattered in five places in the city and suburbs. The factory does not have dormitories, and many workers' homes are more than ten miles away from the workshop. The workers' spare-time school is borrowing a primary school. Female workers account for 75% of the total number of workers in this factory, many of whom are mothers with children. At the same time, the production tasks have been very heavy since October last year. In view of this situation, the factory established a temporary nursery for the workers' spare-time cultural school so that workers with many children can be directly taken home by the school after finishing their studies. At the same time, male workers are mobilized to help female workers on the same road to send their children; additional tutoring classes are set up in the second workshop, where there are the most female workers, and female workers who live too far away from home are introduced to study in nearby factory-run schools. After these measures were taken, some of the difficulties of the workers in learning and life were solved.

    坚持办学五年　工厂面貌一新
    哈尔滨制药厂解决了发展生产和办教育的关系
    本报讯　哈尔滨制药厂五年来坚持办职工业余文化学校，很好地解决了发展生产和办学的关系。
    哈尔滨制药厂是在1953年由松江、新生、哈尔滨三个小型药品制剂厂合并起来的。当时生产设备和生产技术都很落后，职工多数是原有小型药品制剂厂的调剂员和包装工人，他们只能制氯化钠、炭酸钙等简单药品。只有七十多名职工参加职工业余文化学校学习，有80％以上职工是文盲。许多人在生产制剂中遇到带有小数点的数字时，往往不论药品性质、化学反应，用整数计算或大约制剂。至于在制剂中经常应用的比例算法，就更少有人懂得了。因此，生产事故比较多，有的出厂产品被退回一大半，连年不能完成生产任务。当时工厂领导工作被动，生产时间不够用，就挤掉职工业余学习时间。1954年春，工厂领导在实践中逐渐认识到：要改变过去的落后状况，不仅需要提高生产技术，同时还要加速提高职工的文化水平。接着，工厂领导便立即采取措施，加强以职工业余文化学校为主的教学领导，还相继开办了干部训练班、化学班、文学班、俄文班。到1955年，职工的文化和技术便有了显著提高，逐年超额完成生产任务。
    最近，这个工厂充分利用五年来的文化教育成果，发动职工大闹技术革命，进一步提高了生产。去年12月，哈尔滨制药厂的职工们半个月内提出一百五十多条合理化建议，已经实现了五十多条，比去年11月同一时期提高生产效率30％。1953年在扫盲班学习，现在已经达到初中一年程度的女职工张桂琴提出的丸剂挂糖衣的新办法，提高生产效率一倍多。这个厂在保证完成生产任务的前提下，也保证了教学的顺利进行。目前职工业余文化学习出席率已达入学人数的96％；据去年12月统计，有75％的学员得到四、五分，有25％的学员得到三分。
    哈尔滨制药厂把教学看成是发展生产的需要，并想出许多办法，克服许多困难，使教学长期坚持下来。首先解决了生产和教学时间安排的问题。1956年，工厂的生产任务比1955年增加一倍。当时在生产上采取了白天黑夜不停机器的三班倒办法。这就挤掉了夜班职工的学习时间，职工学习出席率突然下降。工厂领导针对这一情况，召集干部会议，研究出重新编班的办法，把参加业余文化学习的职工编在白班学习，参加其他课目学习的职工编在夜班学习。这样职工学习出席率又提高了。其次是解决生产与教学统一领导问题。1957年，出现了职工学习成绩下降现象，工厂领导便分头到各车间调查研究，发现车间干部存有“我是管生产的，办学校是文教干部的事”的想法。针对这一情况，工厂领导便把教育工作纳入党委全面工作规划；委托厂长、工会主席担任职工业余学校校长，车间主任担任车间学习辅导员。从此，便解决了生产与教学的统一领导问题，消除了车间干部把领导教学看成是“份外的事”的想法和做法。再次是解决了缺乏师资的问题。1956年，业余文化学校有十二位教师，其中有七名是由厂外聘请的。这些外聘教师不熟悉生产和学员思想情况；工厂对他们进行思想教育和布置工作也不方便，而且他们常因为本单位工作和教学时间发生冲突而停课。工厂领导便在本厂抽出一些具有教学能力的职工培养为兼职教师。现在全厂二十名教师有十九名是本厂兼职教师，仅有一名是专职教师。此外，还不断解决职工在学习和生活上的具体困难：这个工厂的车间厂房分散在市内和市郊五处，工厂没有宿舍，很多职工的家离车间有十多里路。职工业余学校是借用一个小学校。这个厂的女职工占全厂人数的75％，其中很多人是有孩子的妈妈。同时，去年10月以后生产任务又很重。根据这种情况，工厂便成立职工业余文化学校临时托儿所，使多子女的职工学习结束后，可以由学校直接带着孩子回家。同时发动男职工帮助同路的女职工送孩子；在女职工最多的二车间增设学习补习班，把离家太远的女职工介绍到附近的厂办学校去学习。采取了这些办法以后，便解决了职工在学习和生活问题上的一些困难。
