To be realistic and seek truth from facts is essential in dealing with any matter. This spirit should also be applied to assessing work achievements, neither exaggerating nor minimizing them. This is the most positive factor in driving work forward. The Red Flag People's Commune has fully promoted this scientific attitude in the socialist and communist education movement, with excellent results.

The Red Flag People's Commune achieved a remarkable accomplishment last year by doubling its average grain yield per mu, with significant increases in other crops as well. However, some people in this commune hold a different view: the original plan was not fully realized; otherwise, even more could have been harvested. Under this excessive criticism, a few cadres have become confused. They clearly did so much work, and they could have proposed even greater leap forward targets for this year based on last year's leap forward, but they dare not, fearing they won't complete the plan. These comrades are very cautious and humble, but they don't know how to calculate properly; they are losing sight of their achievements.

Last year was the first year of the commune's establishment, engaging in large-scale Great Leap Forward production, and everyone lacked experience. Who could guarantee that the planned targets would all be so accurate? Only by sifting through the sand can we see the gold. Discarding the original planned targets, what remains is still a doubling of grain production, a leap forward, a leap forward that no one can deny. Compared to the Great Leap Forward, individual small shortcomings are incomparable in size. Trying to negate achievements with shortcomings is like trying to block the sun with your hand; it is simply impossible.

Removing the exaggeration, it is still a leap forward; it is not bowing our heads, but raising them; it is not discouragement, but a multiplied confidence. After the cadres and masses of the Red Flag People's Commune realistically analyzed their achievements and shortcomings, discouragement turned into enthusiasm, relaxation turned into vigor, and the red flag of communist ideology once again flew high. It made people deeply appreciate the correctness of the Party's instructions and feel the incomparable superiority of the People's Commune. Let us strive for even greater victories on the basis of last year's great victory! Let us shout: Long live the People's Commune!

    肯定成绩　奋勇前进
    金戈
    对待任何事情，都要实事求是。对待工作的成绩，也要本着这种精神，既不夸大，也不缩小。这是推动工作前进的最积极的因素。红旗人民公社在社会主义和共产主义教育运动中，充分发扬了这种科学态度，效果很好。
    红旗人民公社去年粮食产量每亩平均增加了一倍，其他作物也都有很大增长，这是一个了不起的成就。可是，在这个公社里，却有人持着另一种看法：原来的计划没有实现；否则，还可能更多收一些。在这种过分的指责下，少数干部也迷惑起来了。明明做了那样多的工作，明明可以在去年跃进的基础上，提出今年更大的跃进的指标，可是，他们不敢提，怕完不成计划。这些同志都是很小心谨慎和很谦逊的人，但是他们却不会算账，他们把成绩算丢了。
    去年，是成立公社的第一年，搞大规模的大跃进的生产，大家都还缺乏经验，谁能保证计划指标都那样准确呢？拨开沙土，才能看见金子。丢掉原来的计划指标，剩下的还是粮食产量增加一倍，这是跃进，是谁也不能否定的跃进。大跃进和个别小缺点比起来，大得不可比拟，要想用缺点来否定成绩，就像用手遮太阳一样，决不可能。
    去掉虚夸，还是跃进；不是低头，而是抬头；不是泄气，应该信心倍增。红旗人民公社干部和群众实事求是地分析了成绩和缺点以后，泄气变成了热气，松劲变成了干劲，共产主义思想红旗又重新飘扬起来。它使人们更深地体会到党的指示的正确性，感到人民公社的无比优越。让我们在去年的伟大胜利的基础上争取更大胜利！让我们高呼：人民公社万岁！
