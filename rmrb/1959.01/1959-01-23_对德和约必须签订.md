On January 10 this year, the Soviet government sent notes to our government and the governments of other countries that participated in the war against Germany, proposing that a peace conference be held within two months, with the governments of countries that had sent armed forces to participate in the war against Germany on one side, and the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the other, to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. On January 21, our government issued a statement expressing its full support for the Soviet government's proposal and agreeing to the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government.

Our government's statement pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal to sign a peace treaty with Germany is very reasonable and timely. The realization of this proposal will not only help prevent the resurgence of German militarism, saving mankind from the threat of a new war, but also serve as an important guarantee for the German people to engage in peaceful and creative labor as members of the family of nations. The statement announced that the Chinese government, as a member state that participated in the war against German fascism, considers itself responsible for promoting the signing of a peace treaty with Germany in order to realize the peaceful settlement of the German question at an early date.

Signing a peace treaty with Germany and peacefully resolving the German question is the urgent desire of all German people and all people in the world who care about the fate of Germany and peace in Europe. Because there is no treaty, foreign troops are still stationed in Germany, and the occupation system is still maintained in West Berlin, so the German people cannot fully exercise their national sovereignty. Because there is no treaty, the two parts of Germany are still in an abnormal state of division, and the German people's desire for reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis cannot be satisfied. Because there is no treaty, German militarist forces have been revived in West Germany with the support of the United States, Britain and other countries, and are being armed with atomic weapons by the United States, which poses a serious threat to the security of the people of European countries. Because there is no treaty, Western countries, especially the United States, have turned West Germany and West Berlin into centers of "cold war" and bridgeheads for launching wars of aggression, seriously endangering world peace.

The Soviet government, faithful to its obligations to Germany and taking into account the legitimate interests of the German people and the people of other European countries, has repeatedly proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain and France since the end of World War II regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful settlement of the German question. Although the United States, Britain and France have repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals with various unreasonable excuses, the Soviet Union has continued to make unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the German question. Recently, after the Western countries once again rejected the Soviet proposal to establish a demilitarized free city of West Berlin on the grounds that the Berlin issue must be resolved together with the entire German issue, the Soviet government once again proposed to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Union's unyielding efforts fully demonstrate its sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question and promoting German reunification.

The German Democratic Republic has also made great contributions to the peaceful settlement of the German question. In order to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the government of the German Democratic Republic has, in addition to actively supporting the Soviet Union's peaceful efforts, repeatedly put forward various constructive proposals to the West German government aimed at promoting the rapprochement of the two Germanys. In this regard, the proposal put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic on July 27, 1957, regarding the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys, is of particular importance; because, under the current conditions where two Germanys exist, the establishment of a confederation is the only realistic way to restore German reunification. The government of the German Democratic Republic was the first to express its agreement and support for the Soviet government's proposal this time, and announced its willingness to hold preliminary negotiations with the West German authorities on the draft treaty. The sincere efforts made by the government of the German Democratic Republic for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the maintenance of world peace have been highly praised by the people of the world.

However, the Western countries and the Adenauer regime have never treated the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic with a serious attitude. Apart from answering with a "no," they have used all sorts of untenable reasons to justify their position of refusing to peacefully resolve the German question. They have once again used the same old tricks to deal with the new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union this time. The US State Department issued a statement insisting that "free elections" are the "best and most reasonable way" to unify Germany. Eisenhower and Dulles nonsense that the purpose of the Soviet proposal is to "isolate" Germany. They insisted that a unified Germany must establish a "very close union" with the North Atlantic Group. Dulles also used "narrow agenda" as an excuse to declare that while discussing the peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue, it is also necessary to discuss the issue of restoring German reunification and European security.

All these excuses are nothing new, and they have all been refuted long ago.

People have pointed out more than once fairly that the restoration of German reunification is entirely a matter for the German people themselves, and that German reunification can only be achieved through mutual rapprochement and consultation between the two Germanys. It is obvious that the US government insists on holding so-called "all-German free elections" before concluding a peace treaty with Germany, withdrawing foreign troops from Germany, and peacefully and democratically unifying Germany, which is a naked exposure that they do not want to peacefully resolve the German question at all. They do this for only one purpose, which is for West Germany to annex the German Democratic Republic. But this plan of US imperialism and its partners can only be a delusional fantasy.

Everyone knows that one of the important obstacles that currently makes the two Germanys divided and difficult to approach is that West Germany has joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which is aimed at the socialist camp including the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, to unify Germany, it is necessary to lift West Germany's obligations to the North Atlantic Group, which is an extremely simple principle. However, the United States insists that even a unified Germany must be a member of the North Atlantic Group, which is of course unacceptable to the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. This approach by the United States can only show that its real intention is to turn Germany into a forward base for attacking the socialist camp.

People also see very clearly that the reason why the United States insists on confusing the issue of European security, which is completely different in nature, with the issue of German peaceful reunification is to complicate the work of peacefully resolving the German question and make it impossible to resolve. The most powerful proof is that the United States has never really cared about the issue of European security. Not only has it never put forward any practical and feasible proposals on this issue, but it has rejected all the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on this issue (for example, on the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, on the withdrawal of foreign troops from European territory, on the Soviet Union's support for Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, etc.).

The stubborn and rigid policy adopted by the United States and its partners on the German question has not only aroused the opposition of the people of the world, but has also aroused the concern of many people within the imperialist camp. There are more and more voices calling for a change in the current rigid US policy. However, the US government still uses old weapons to resist the new proposal of the Soviet Union this time; this shows that the United States does not want to give up its reactionary policy on the German question, and at the same time shows that it has run out of arguments and is in an increasingly difficult position.

The position of the West German Adenauer government is also equally bad. In order to realize the dream of annexing the German Democratic Republic, it has followed the Western imperialism step by step on the German question, and has already made itself a vanguard in advocating the continued occupation of Germany by foreign countries. Such a disgraceful role has also aroused strong dissatisfaction among people from all walks of life in West Germany. This time, the Soviet Union put forward a new proposal, and the Adenauer government was the first to shout "no" impatiently, which resulted in a huge storm in West German political circles. Not only did the opposition parties criticize it one after another, but also dissatisfaction grew within Adenauer's own government and party. According to Western reporters, more and more West Germans, including many people who have influence on West German politics, are increasingly inclined to believe that it is necessary to hold negotiations with the German Democratic Republic on the issue of reunification.

The Soviet Union's proposal to sign a peace treaty with Germany has been praised and supported by public opinion in various countries; and the unreasonable attitude shown by Western countries and the West German authorities towards this proposal so far has aroused the indignation of the people of the world. Fair public opinion in various countries generally believes that the solution of the German question can no longer be delayed, and the United States, Britain and France and the Adenauer government must show sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question seriously. A peace treaty with Germany must be signed! If Western countries and the West German authorities once again unreasonably reject the Soviet government's proposal, then, as our government's statement solemnly pointed out, they will be further severely condemned by all peace-loving people in the world, and must bear full responsibility for sabotaging the solution of the German question.

### 对德和约必须签订

    对德和约必须签订
    今年1月10日，苏联政府向我国政府和其他参加对德战争的国家的政府发出照会，建议在两个月内召开曾派武装部队参加对德战争的国家的政府为一方和以德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府为另一方的和会，来讨论和签订对德和约。1月21日，我国政府发表声明，表示完全支持苏联政府的这项建议，并且同意苏联政府提出的对德和约草案。
    我国政府声明中指出：苏联政府关于签订对德和约的建议是非常合理和适时的。实现这项建议，不仅有助于防止德国军国主义的再起，使人类免受新战争的威胁；同时，也是使德国人民作为各国人民大家庭中的一员，而从事和平和创造性劳动的重要保证。声明宣布：中国政府作为曾经是参加反对德国法西斯战争的成员国，认为自己有责任促成对德和约的签订，以利于早日实现德国问题的和平解决。
    签订对德和约，和平解决德国问题——这是全体德国人民和世界上一切关怀德国的命运、关怀欧洲和平的人民的迫切愿望。由于没有和约，德国境内至今仍然驻扎着外国军队，西柏林还保留着占领制度，因而德国人民不能完全行使自己国家的主权。由于没有和约，德国东西两部分至今仍然处于不正常的分裂状态，德国人民要求在和平民主的基础上重新统一的愿望不能得到满足。由于没有和约，德国军国主义势力在美英等国的扶植下已在西德复活起来，并且正在被美国用原子武器武装起来，这造成了对欧洲各国人民安全的严重威胁。由于没有和约，西方国家，特别是美国已把西德和西柏林变为“冷战”中心和发动侵略战争的桥头堡，严重地危害着世界和平。
    苏联政府忠于自己对德国承担的义务，并且考虑到德国人民和其他欧洲国家人民的合法利益，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，一次又一次地向美英法三国政府提出关于缔结对德和约以及和平解决德国问题的建议。尽管美英法三国屡次用种种无理借口拒绝了苏联的合理建议，苏联仍然为和平解决德国问题而进行了不懈的努力。最近，在西方国家又以柏林问题必须同整个德国问题一道解决为借口而拒绝苏联关于建立西柏林非军事化自由城市的建议以后，苏联政府又一次提出了缔结对德和约的建议。苏联这种不折不挠的努力，充分证明了它对和平解决德国问题和促进德国统一的诚意。
    德意志民主共和国在和平解决德国问题上，也作出了巨大的贡献。为了促进祖国的和平统一，德意志民主共和国政府多年来除了积极支持苏联的和平努力之外，还一再向西德政府提出旨在促进两个德国接近的各种建设性的建议。在这方面，德意志民主共和国政府，1957年7月27日所提出的关于两个德国成立邦联的建议，具有特殊重要的意义；因为，在目前存在有两个德国的条件下，成立邦联是恢复德国统一的唯一现实的道路。对于这次苏联政府提出的建议，德意志民主共和国政府又首先表示赞同和支持，并且宣布愿意同西德当局就和约草案举行预备性的谈判。德意志民主共和国政府为和平统一祖国和维护世界和平所作出的真诚努力，得到了世界人民的崇高评价。
    但是，西方国家和阿登纳政权却从来不以认真的态度对待苏联和德意志民主共和国的合理建议。它们除了回答一个“不”字之外，就是用种种不能成立的理由来为它们的拒绝和平解决德国问题的立场辩护。对于苏联这次提出的新建议，它们又一次施展了老一套的手法。美国国务院发表声明硬说“自由选举”是统一德国的“最好和最合理的办法”。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯胡说苏联建议的目的是要“孤立、隔离”德国。他们坚持统一的德国必须和北大西洋集团建立“非常紧密的联合”。杜勒斯还以“议程狭窄”为借口，宣称在讨论对德和约和柏林问题的同时，也必须讨论恢复德国统一问题和欧洲安全问题。
    所有这些借口都不是什么新鲜的东西，而且都是早就被驳倒了的东西。
    人们已经不止一次公正地指出，恢复德国统一完全是德国人民自己的事情，只有通过两个德国互相接近和协商的途径，才能实现德国的统一。显而易见，美国政府坚持在缔结对德和约、外国军队撤出德国、和平民主地统一德国之前举行所谓“全德自由选举”，是赤裸裸地暴露他们根本不想和平解决德国问题。他们这样做只有一个目的，就是由西德并吞德意志民主共和国。但是美帝国主义和它的伙伴们的这种打算，只能是一种狂妄的幻想。
    谁都知道，目前使两个德国处于分裂、难以接近的重要障碍之一就是：西德参加了矛头指向包括德意志民主共和国的社会主义阵营的北大西洋侵略集团。因此，要统一德国，就必须解除西德对北大西洋集团所承担的义务，这是极其浅显的道理。然而，美国却坚持甚至统一后的德国也必须是北大西洋集团的一员，这当然是以苏联为首的社会主义各国所不能接受的。美国的这种做法，只能说明它的真实意图是要把德国变为进攻社会主义阵营的前进基地。
    人们也看得很清楚，美国所以坚持要把性质完全不同的欧洲安全问题同德国和平统一问题混淆在一起，就是为了要使和平解决德国问题的工作复杂化，使它得不到解决。最有力的证明就是，美国从来就没有真正地关心过欧洲安全问题。它不但从来没有在这一问题上提出过任何切实可行的建议，而且把苏联就这一问题所提出的建议（比如，关于北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织参加国之间缔结互不侵犯条约，关于外国军队撤出欧洲领土，关于苏联支持波兰的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议等等），一概拒绝了。
    美国和它的伙伴们在德国问题上所采取的顽固的、僵硬的政策，不但招致了世界人民的反对，而且也引起了帝国主义阵营内部不少人的忧虑。要求改变美国现行僵硬政策的呼声越来越多。但是，美国政府对这次苏联的新建议，依然拿出陈旧的武器来抵挡一番；这说明美国还不想放弃它在德国问题上的反动政策，同时也说明它已经理屈词穷，处于越来越困难的地位了。
    西德阿登纳政府的地位也是同样的不妙。它为了实现并吞德意志民主共和国的迷梦，在德国问题上同西方帝国主义亦步亦趋，已经使自己成为鼓吹外国继续占领德国的急先锋。这样一个不光彩的角色，也引起了西德内部各阶层人士的强烈不满。这次苏联提出新建议，阿登纳政府又首先迫不及待地喊“不”，结果在西德政界引起巨大的风波，不但是反对派纷纷予以抨击，就在阿登纳自己的政府和党内也增长着不满的情绪。根据西方记者的报道，越来越多的西德人士，包括许多对西德政治有影响的人，都日益倾向于认为必须同德意志民主共和国就统一问题举行谈判。
    苏联关于签订对德和约的建议，已经获得了各国舆论的赞扬和拥护；而西方国家和西德当局迄今为止对这一建议所表现的无理态度，已经引起世界人民的愤慨。各国公正的舆论普遍认为，德国问题的解决已经不容再拖延了，美英法三国和阿登纳政府必须拿出诚意来认真地和平解决德国问题。对德和约必须签订！如果西方国家和西德当局再次无理拒绝苏联政府的建议，那么，正如我国政府声明所严正指出的，它们必将进一步遭到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责，并且必须对破坏德国问题的解决承担全部责任。
