    A Year's Plan Starts in Spring
    Seizing time is extremely important for everyone and everything.
    This year is a year of even greater leaps forward in our country, and the tasks are even more arduous. To strive for greater victories, seizing time is of particular importance.
    To seize time, the first requirement is to grasp the completion and over-fulfillment of the first quarter's plan; only by grasping this link can we lay a good foundation for this year's even greater leap forward.
    At present, the most important thing is to formulate advanced yet stable and reliable plans and measures, and to start working on them immediately. With a plan, there is something to strive for; with measures, there are concrete arrangements. This will prevent us from wasting time and ensure that construction and all work are done quickly and well.
    Today, this newspaper publishes news from some factories and mines in Shenyang, Beijing, and Tianjin, hoping that their experience can encourage everyone to seize time.
    A year's plan starts in spring. Let us cherish every minute and second!

    一年之计在于春
    争取时间，对每个人、每件事来说，都是极为重要的。
    今年，是我国更大跃进的一年，任务更加艰巨。要争取更大的胜利，争取时间，就更有着特别重要的意义。
    争取时间，首先就是要求抓紧完成和超额完成第一季度的计划；只有抓住这个环节，才能为今年更为伟大的跃进打好基础。
    目前，最重要的是制订出先进而又稳妥可靠的计划和措施，并立即动手做起来。有计划就有奔头，有措施就有具体安排。这就不致蹉跎浪费时间，而使建设和一切工作作得又快又好。
    今天本报发表了沈阳、北京、天津一些厂矿的消息，希望它们的经验能促进大家都来争取时间。
    一年之计在于春，让我们十分珍惜每分每秒的时间吧！
