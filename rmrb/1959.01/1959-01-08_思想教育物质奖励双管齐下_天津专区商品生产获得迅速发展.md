Ideological Education and Material Rewards Work Together
Commodity Production in Tianjin District Achieves Rapid Development

(Our Dispatch) The Party organizations at all levels in the Tianjin area, in leading the masses to vigorously develop diversified economy and commodity production, adopted the method of combining communist education and economic rewards to mobilize the masses, with every commune and every team participating, and everyone lending a hand. This has promoted the development of diversified economic activities, accelerated the growth of commodity production in the communes, and increased the collective income of the communes and the individual income of the members, creating material conditions for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 and the further improvement of the lives of the members.

The Tianjin District of Hebei Province is close to the Bohai Sea, with many rivers, depressions, and ponds, and rich in various economic raw materials such as reeds, rushes, osier, and willow, providing material conditions for the development of commodity production. Diversified economic production has been relatively developed over the years. However, after agriculture achieved unprecedented harvests in 1958 and the people's communes were realized, some illusions arose among many cadres and the masses. Some cadres and masses did not recognize the significant role of commodity production for agriculture itself and urban and rural production and construction, paying attention only to agriculture and neglecting the development of diversified economic production. The Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied and analyzed these situations, believing that the obstacles to the rapid development of diversified economy and commodity production included both ideological and policy issues. Therefore, it was decided to use a combination of communist education and economic rewards to promote the development of diversified economy and commodity production.

The facts in the Tianjin District prove that only by putting communist ideology in command and helping the masses overcome various ideological obstacles can diversified economy be developed and commodity production be promoted. In the early stages of the development of diversified economy in this district, Party committees at all levels, targeting the ideology of cadres and the masses that were satisfied with a self-sufficient economy, conducted a mass debate among all the people on many ideological issues such as whether the people's communes should develop diversified economy to increase commodity production, and the role of commodity production in national construction and consolidating the people's communes. This helped cadres and the masses recognize the important significance of increasing commodity production. The cadres and masses of various people's communes in Cangzhou City broke through various ideological obstacles such as fear of being labeled as capitalist by developing commodity production in the course of airing their views and debating. They made plans at all levels and quickly organized 27% of the labor force to engage in diversified economic production.

The Party organizations at all levels in the Tianjin area, using the method of economic rewards, combined the collective interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests of the communes, production teams, and commune members, which played a great role in stimulating the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members to vigorously engage in diversified operations and increase commodity production. Dazidian Production Team of the Dongfeng Fifth Commune in Cangxian County has more than two hundred people who can weave sieves, and the commune has already signed a sales contract with other places. This sideline occupation, which has large income and sufficient raw materials, was not actively pursued by the team before the implementation of economic rewards. Later, after the implementation of the economic reward method of completing the prescribed tasks and turning over the excess income to the team, the team not only put people with technical skills into weaving, but also dispatched three rubber-wheeled carts to transport raw materials and products. The economic rewards for promoting commodity production in this district currently include the following methods: First, on the basis of setting tasks and determining income, the commune implements over-fulfillment rewards to the production team or professional team. Second, the commune distributes income to the team and the team distributes income to the commune members (some small sideline occupations) according to a certain proportion to timely solve the needs of the production team and commune members for money. Third, technical allowances are issued to reward people with expertise to take the lead in production. Fourth, the income from small sideline occupations engaged by commune members using production gaps belongs to the commune members themselves. Fifth, the skilled labor in the commune factories and workshops, in addition to evaluating a higher wage level within the commune, also combines with competition and appraisal, and rewards advanced individuals with a small amount of daily necessities (towels, notebooks, etc.). In addition, the commune also sets commodity production tasks and income for the production team, and uses commodity production income to offset the production and living allocations given by the commune to the production team, so that commodity income first meets the needs of the production teams themselves.

The Tianjin District adopted the method of combining communist education and economic rewards, which greatly accelerated the growth rate of commodity production. According to statistics as of December 20, 1958, in twenty days, the number of commodity production projects in the entire district increased from more than sixty to one hundred and forty, and the value of commodities provided by the entire district reached 22,870,000 yuan, and the daily net profit also increased from 270,000 to 870,000 yuan. Various products have shown significant growth. The supply of products to cities and other places has also gradually increased. At present, this district can export 90,000 catties of fish and shrimp, 48,000 reed mats, 180,000 willow-woven appliances, as well as mirabilite, dumpling dough, and other products every day. The development of commodity production has also increased the income of communes and commune members. In twenty days, the entire district obtained a net profit of 16,220,000 yuan. Many communes have accumulated a certain amount of funds from commodity production income for the industrial and agricultural leap forward in 1959, and have also supported the development of commune members' welfare undertakings.

    思想教育物质奖励双管齐下
    天津专区商品生产获得迅速发展
    本报讯　天津地区各级党组织在领导群众大搞多种经济发展商品生产当中，采用共产主义教育和经济奖励相结合的办法发动群众，社社搞，队队搞，人人动手，推动了多种经济活动的开展，加速了公社商品性生产的增长，增加了公社集体和社员个人的收入，为1959年工农业生产更大的跃进和社员生活的进一步改善，创造了物质条件。
    河北省天津专区紧靠渤海，境内河流洼淀较多，蒲、苇、荆、柳等多种经济原料丰富，有发展商品生产的物质条件。历年来多种经济的生产比较发达。但在1958年农业获得空前丰收和实现了人民公社化后，在许多干部群众当中却产生了一些错觉。部分干部群众没有认识到商品性生产对农业本身和城乡生产建设的重大作用，只注意农业，忽视多种经济生产的开展。中共天津地委研究分析了这些情况，认为多种经济和商品生产迅速开展的障碍，有思想问题，也有政策问题，因此确定用共产主义教育和经济奖励相结合的办法，推动多种经济和商品生产的发展。
    天津专区的事实证明，只有以共产主义思想挂帅，帮助群众克服各种思想障碍，才能搞起多种经济，促进商品生产。这个专区在多种经济开展的初期，各级党委针对着干部群众满足于自给经济的思想，就人民公社应该不应该发展多种经济增加商品生产，商品生产对国家建设和巩固人民公社的作用等许多思想问题，进行全民大辩论，帮助干部群众认识了增加商品性生产的重要意义。沧州市各人民公社的干部群众在鸣放辩论中打破了怕发展商品生产扣上资本主义帽子等各种思想障碍，层层作规划，很快就组织起27％的劳力从事多种经济生产。
    天津地区各级党组织运用经济奖励的办法，把公社、生产队、社员群众的集体利益和个人利益，长远利益和目前利益结合起来，对激发干部社员大搞多种经营增加商品生产的积极性起了很大作用。沧县东风第五公社达子店生产队，有二百多人会编筛子，社里已和外地订好销售合同。这项收益大原料足的副业在没有实行经济奖励前，这个队对它是不积极的。后来实行了完成规定上缴任务，超额收入归队的经济奖励办法以后，这个队不仅将会技术的人投入编织，并抽出三辆胶轮大车运送原料和产品。这个专区促进商品生产的经济奖励，目前有以下几种办法。一、在定任务定收入的基础上，公社对生产队或专业队实行超额奖励。二、社对队、队对社员（一些小副业）按比例分配收入，及时解决生产队和社员的用钱需要。三、发给技术津贴，奖励有专长的人带头生产。四、社员利用生产空隙搞的小副业收入，归社员个人所有。五、公社工厂作坊中的有技术的劳力，劳动收入在公社内评定较高的工资级别外，并结合竞赛评比，对先进者奖给少量的生活用品（毛巾笔记本等）。此外，公社还给生产队定商品生产任务和收入，以商品生产收入抵销公社给生产队的生产生活拨款，使商品收入首先满足各生产队自己的需要。
    天津专区采用共产主义教育和经济奖励相结合的办法，大大加快了商品生产的增长速度。截止1958年12月20日统计，在二十天当中，全区商品性生产的项目即由原来的六十多种增加到一百四十种，全专区所提供的商品产值，即达两千二百八十七万元，日获纯收益亦由二十七万增加到八十七万元。各种产品均有显著增长。供应城市及外地的产品也逐渐增多。目前，这个专区每天能输出九万斤鱼虾、四万八千片苇席、十八万件柳编器具以及皮硝、粉团等其他产品。商品性生产的发展，同时还增加了公社和社员的收入。二十天当中，全区共获得纯收益一千六百二十二万元。许多公社已从商品性生产收入中，为1959年的工农业跃进积累了一定数量的资金，也支持了社员福利事业的开展。　　　　　　　（张华）
