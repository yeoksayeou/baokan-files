Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd - On the evening of January 21st, before concluding his visit to Vietnam, Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, wrote a letter to Premier Pham Van Dong stating that the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, currently visiting Vietnam, strongly condemns the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, acting on the orders of American imperialism, for the crime of murdering over a thousand former resistance fighters and patriotic individuals in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam, and firmly supports the Vietnamese people's just struggle against this atrocity.

The letter stated: We believe that our delegation's indignation over this incident also represents the shared feelings of the people of the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving people in Germany. The letter stated that this brutal crime is a continuation of the past colonialists' policies of suppression, aimed at opposing the South Vietnamese people's struggle for independence, unification, peace, and democracy.

Premier Grotewohl stated in the letter that the Phu Loi incident shows that the anti-popular Ngo Dinh Diem clique, relying on the bayonets of American imperialism to maintain its rule through violence, is becoming increasingly weak. Victory will certainly belong to the patriotic forces of South Vietnam, because they are fighting for the most just and noblest cause of the nation.

    格罗提渥总理函范文同总理
    谴责吴庭艳集团残酷暴行
    新华社河内22日电　德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在21日晚上结束对越南的访问前夕写信给范文同总理说，正在越南访问的德意志民主共和国政府代表团强烈谴责奉行美帝国主义命令的吴庭艳集团杀害南越富利集中营中的一千多名前抗战人员和爱国人士的罪行，坚决支持越南人民反对这种暴行的正义斗争。
    信里说：我们相信，我们代表团对这一事件的愤慨心情也代表了德意志民主共和国人民和全德国爱好和平人民的共同心情。信里说，这种残暴的罪行是过去殖民主义者镇压政策的继续，是为了反对争取独立、统一、和平和民主的南越人民的。
    格罗提渥总理在信里说，富利事件表明，依靠美帝国主义的刺刀用暴力来维持统治地位的反人民的吴庭艳集团正在日益衰弱。而胜利将一定属于南越的爱国力量，因为他们在为民族的最正当的和最崇高的事业而斗争。
