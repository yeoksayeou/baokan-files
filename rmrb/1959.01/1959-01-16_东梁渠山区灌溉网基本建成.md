Dongliang Canal
    Basic Completion of the Mountainous Area Irrigation Network

    (Our report) The people of the Dongliang Canal area in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, the national banner for bringing water up the mountains, with a spirit of continuous revolution, have basically realized the systematization of mountainous area irrigation after a year of hard work. The more than 30,000 mu of land in the entire irrigated area can now achieve: a guaranteed water source in all four seasons, no need to rely on the heavens even in a hundred days of severe drought; canals, ponds, dams, and cellars all connected, great development of water energy utilization; free and diverse irrigation, with water flowing by gravity like blood vessels; using surplus to make up for shortages and ensuring timely irrigation, with water available for irrigation everywhere.

    After the Dongliang Canal brought water up the mountain, the leadership of the irrigated area adopted a method that combined mobilizing the masses, carrying out large-scale shock movements, and regular maintenance. They implemented the principle of using all "three waters" and, based on continuously summarizing and improving the masses' experience in mountainous irrigation, and according to the need to rationally arrange the canal system after bringing water up the mountain to quickly solve the need for comprehensive irrigation of mountainous areas, they launched a magnificent construction project for the systematization of mountainous area irrigation. Now, the entire irrigated area has newly opened 314 branch canals, built 75 water storage ponds alongside the canals according to local conditions, and 71 ponds connected to cellars. At the same time, 510 meters of inverted siphons have been installed in high terraces where canal water cannot reach. In order to prevent water evaporation and achieve economical water use, open canals have been converted into underground pipelines, with seven pipelines totaling 1,500 meters in length, and more than 500 sets of self-made artificial rainmaking devices. Through the above comprehensive measures, a relatively complete mountainous area irrigation network has been basically formed, achieving a situation where forests are connected to rivers, rivers are connected to reservoirs, reservoirs are connected to canals, canals are connected to ponds, ponds are connected to cellars, and cellars surround each mu of land. Like blood vessels in the human body, it can freely transport water to every piece of land, using the methods of "hundred horses parting the mane" and "long vines bearing melons" to carry out mountainous area irrigation.

    In order to further realize advanced mountainous irrigation systematization, in addition to continuing to repair and reinforce the original projects and carry out new projects, the Dongliang irrigation area will also build a large reservoir at the canal intake this spring that can store 1,300 to 1,500 cubic meters of water, and it will also level more than 7,000 mu of mountainous land to create more favorable irrigation conditions for all cultivated land to achieve garden-style cultivation this year.

### 东梁渠山区灌溉网基本建成

    东梁渠
    山区灌溉网基本建成
    本报讯　全国引水上山旗帜——甘肃武山东梁渠一带的人民，以不断革命的精神，经过一年奋战，已基本实现了山区灌溉系统化。全灌区的三万多亩土地，可以做到：水源四季有保证，百日大旱不求天；渠塘坝窖齐相连，水能利用大发展；灌溉自如多样化，引水自流如血管；以余济缺保适时，处处有水能灌田。
    东梁渠引水上山以后，灌区领导上采取发动群众，大搞突击运动和平时护养相结合的办法，贯彻
  “三水”皆用的方针，在不断总结提高群众山地灌溉经验的基础上，根据引水上山后必须合理布置渠系，迅速解决山地全面灌溉的需要，开展了山区灌溉系统化的宏伟建设工程。现在，全灌区共新开支渠三百一十四条，在渠旁因地制宜地设蓄水塘七十五座、塘连窖七十一个，同时在渠水流不到的高台地，安装倒虹吸管五百一十公尺。为了防止水量蒸发，做到经济用水，还将明渠改为地下管道，七条管道共长一千五百公尺，自制人工降雨器五百多套。经过以上综合措施，基本上形成了一套比较完整的山地灌溉网，做到了林连河、河连库、库连渠、渠连塘、塘连窖、窖包亩。它像人体的血管一样，可以自如地给每块土地输送水量，用“百马分鬃”和“长藤结瓜”的办法，进行山地灌溉。
    为了进一步实现高级山地灌溉系统化，东梁灌区除继续加修加固原有工程和开展新的工程外，还要在今春在渠道引水口处修建一个能蓄水一千三百公方到一千五百公方的大水库，并要再修平山地七千多亩，为全部耕地今年达到耕作园田化，创造更有利的灌溉条件。
