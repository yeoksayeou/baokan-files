Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 25th: Xiang Xiuli, a young female worker at the Guangzhou Hejigong Pharmaceutical Factory, gloriously sacrificed her young life in order to rescue national property, protect the safety of people's lives, and prevent a serious explosion accident.

The incident occurred on the evening of December 13th last year. When Xiang Xiuli and three other workers from the same factory were working in the methylthiouracil production group on the fourth floor of the pharmaceutical factory, a large amount of anhydrous alcohol spilled on the ground after an alcohol bottle was broken, and it came into contact with the heat of a nearby coal stove, immediately causing a raging fire. The situation was very critical at the time. If the fire spread and ignited the several large tanks of metallic sodium piled up near the workshop, it would cause an explosion and lead to a fire. This would not only cause serious damage to the factory, but also endanger the lives and property of nearby residents.

At this critical moment, Comrade Xiang Xiuli demonstrated the noble qualities of an outstanding Communist Party member. Without taking time to grab a fire extinguisher, she bravely rushed towards the fire and used her hands to stop the alcohol from flowing towards the metallic sodium. Luo Xiuming, Lu De, and others who were present also immediately joined the rescue.

The flames quickly rushed towards Xiang Xiuli's hands and clothes, which were soaked in alcohol, and her body caught fire. The fellow workers next to her urged her to quickly go outside to put it out, but Xiang Xiuli said to them: "Don't mind me, quickly call people to put out the fire!" The fire continued to burn from her feet to her abdomen, and then from her abdomen to her chest. In particular, her hands, because she desperately stopped the burning alcohol from flowing towards the metallic sodium, were almost burned. But she still insisted on carrying out the rescue. When Lu Hua, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, led the workers to the rescue, Xiang Xiuli was already on fire all over her body. Lu Hua stepped forward to extinguish the flames on her body, but she stopped him and said: "Leave me alone, you quickly go and rescue the metallic sodium."

A catastrophe was averted, the factory was saved, and many people's lives were spared from disaster. However, Xiang Xiuli, the outstanding daughter of the Party and the people, was severely burned all over her body in the rescue and was dying. The burn area accounted for 67.25% of the entire body, of which third-degree burns accounted for 40%.

Comrade Xiang Xiuli cared for the cause of the Party and the people more than she cared for her own life. When she was sent to the hospital and regained consciousness after emergency treatment, her first question was to the Party branch secretary: "Did the metallic sodium explode? What losses did the factory suffer?" When her husband came to visit her, Comrade Xiang Xiuli said to him: "I will get better soon, you don't have to worry about me. If you worry about me, it will cause you to be distracted when driving the train and cause an accident."

The Party and the people tried everything possible to save Comrade Xiang Xiuli's life. When she was sent to the Third People's Hospital of Guangzhou, Xue Yan, the secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, immediately organized the heads of the Municipal Health Bureau and the leaders of relevant departments and hospitals, as well as doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, to form a rescue team. They regularly held city-wide consultations of Chinese and Western medicine, and also specially sent two doctors, four directors of surgery, and seven nurses to carefully provide medical treatment and care. In the critical moment of her illness, the doctors, nurses, and the Party branch secretary of the pharmaceutical factory stayed up for several days and nights, doing their best to rescue her.

Countless people donated their blood to save Comrade Xiang Xiuli's life. In the course of the rescue, the plasma infused into Xiang Xiuli was equivalent to the entire blood volume of two healthy people. Thanks to the active rescue efforts from all sides, Xiang Xiuli's life was extended for thirty-three days after the large-area burns. On January 15th, Comrade Xiang Xiuli gloriously sacrificed her life due to her severe injuries.

Comrade Xiang Xiuli was the daughter of a poor peasant. She started working in a factory at the age of eleven and suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation by capitalists. She joined the Communist Youth League in 1954 and was admitted as a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party last year.

In order to commend Comrade Xiang Xiuli's selfless and heroic sacrifice, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a memorial service and posthumously recognized Comrade Xiang Xiuli as a full member of the Chinese Communist Party. (Attached picture)

    爱护国家财产胜过个人生命
    向秀丽舍身遏火救工厂
    新华社广州25日电　广州市何济公制药厂青年女工向秀丽同志，为了搭救国家财产，保护人民生命安全，制止严重的爆炸事故，光荣地献出了自己年轻的生命。
    事情发生在去年12月13日晚上。向秀丽和同厂三个工人在制药厂四楼甲基硫氧嘧啶生产小组工作的时候，因打破酒精瓶，大量的无水酒精流泻地面，接触到附近煤炉的热气，顿时引起熊熊烈火。当时情况十分危急，如果烈火蔓延，燃着车间附近堆放着的几大罐金属钠，就要引起爆炸，酿成火灾。这样，不但使工厂遭受严重损失，还要殃及附近居民的生命财产。
    在这千钧一发的时候，向秀丽同志表现了一个优秀的共产党员的高贵品质，她来不及去拿灭火器，就奋不顾身扑向烈火，用双手阻止酒精流向金属钠。在场的罗秀明、卢德等人也立即参加抢救。
    火焰很快扑向向秀丽那沾满酒精的双手和衣衫，她身上着火了。在旁边的工友劝她赶快到外面去弄熄，但是向秀丽对他们说：“别理我，快去叫人来救火！”火继续从她的脚烧到腹部，又从腹部烧到胸部，特别是她的一双手，由于拼命截止着火的酒精流向金属钠，已经几乎被烧焦了，但他还是坚持进行抢救。到工厂党支部书记卢华率领工人前来抢救时，向秀丽已全身着火。卢华上前扑灭她身上的烈火，她还阻拦说：“别管我，你们快快去抢救金属钠。”
    一场浩劫过了，工厂得救了，不少人的生命免于遭难，可是，党和人民的优秀女儿向秀丽却在抢救中全身烫烧，奄奄一息。烧伤面积占整个身体的67.25％，其中三度伤又占40％。
    向秀丽同志关心党和人民的事业，胜过关心自己的生命。当她被送进医院，经过急救清醒过来后，她第一句话就问党支部书记：“金属钠没有爆炸吧？工厂有什么损失？”她丈夫来探望时，向秀丽同志对他说：“我很快就会好的，你不必挂念我，如果惦着我，会使你在开火车时思想开小差，造成事故。”
    党和人民想尽一切办法抢救向秀丽同志的生命。当她被送进广州市第三人民医院时，中共广州市委书记薛焰立即组织市卫生局负责人以及有关部门和医院的领导人、中西医生成立了抢救小组，经常举行全市中、西医会诊，还特地派了两个医生、四个外科主任和七个护士精心医疗和护理。在病情危重的关头，医生、护士和制药厂的党支部书记都几天几夜守候，全力抢救。
    无数人为抢救向秀丽同志的生命输出自己的鲜血。在抢救过程中，给向秀丽输入的血浆，等于两个健康人的全身血量。由于各方面积极抢救，使向秀丽在大面积烧伤后生命延续了三十三天。1月15日，向秀丽同志终因伤势过重，光荣牺牲。
    向秀丽同志是一个贫农的女儿，十一岁就开始在工厂里做工，受尽资本家的压迫剥削。1954年加入青年团，去年被吸收为中共预备党员。
    为了表彰向秀丽同志大公无私、英勇牺牲的高贵品质和模范行为，中共广州市中区委员会曾举行了追悼会，并追认向秀丽同志为中共正式党员。（附图片）
