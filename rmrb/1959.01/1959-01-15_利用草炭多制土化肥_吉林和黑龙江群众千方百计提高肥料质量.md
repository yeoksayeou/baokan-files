    Use Peat to Make More Native Fertilizer
    Jilin and Heilongjiang Masses Try Every Possible Way to Improve Fertilizer Quality

    (Our Newspaper News) In Jilin Province, the winter manure accumulation movement, centered on large-scale digging of peat and large-scale smoking of soil fertilizer, is now reaching a full-fledged climax. By January 9th, the number of people participating in manure accumulation throughout the province had reached more than 590,000 per day, accumulating a total of more than 510 million tons of various kinds of manure. While vigorously developing farm manure, various localities are continuing to allocate manpower and reform tools to vigorously dig peat, manufacture native fertilizer, and burn smoked soil fertilizer. At present, the province has excavated more than 25.78 million tons of peat, built more than 20,000 native fertilizer factories, and produced more than 690,000 tons of native fertilizer.

    Jilin Province has very rich peat resources, and every county has them. In the manure accumulation debates, the masses in various places unanimously believed that to ensure sufficient fertilizer for this year's crops, it is necessary to vigorously dig peat based on the local characteristics of abundant peat, shortage of human and animal power, and small amount of farm manure. Jiutai County has found more than 500 peat producing areas, and has currently excavated 548,000 tons. In Erdahezi People's Commune of this county, led by the Party Committee Secretary, an 800-person peat digging team was organized, and in a few days, they dug more than 10,000 tons of peat. In Yushu County, peat can be found almost everywhere. The Yushu County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all communes to closely rely on the masses, vigorously dig peat, and ferment it as it is dug, transported, and distributed. Currently, 540,000 tons of peat have been dug. In Bijiabaozi Management District of Wanfa People's Commune in Lishu County, in the manure accumulation movement, they grasped the method of taking peat digging as the main task to drive other manure accumulation. In the forty days from November to December last year alone, the entire management district dug 125,000 tons of peat. They organized a professional peat digging team and implemented a system of specific responsibilities for excavation, loading, unloading, and transportation, greatly improving labor efficiency.

    After peat is heated and fermented, it can generally increase the fertilizer effect by half to one time or more. At present, the masses in various places have created more than ten kinds of methods for heating and fermenting peat.

    In this year's manure accumulation movement in Jilin Province, various localities have also vigorously burned smoked soil fertilizer based on the situation of having more firewood. As early as the initial stage of deep plowing, Shuangyang and other counties used the method of burning smoked soil fertilizer to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilization in deep plowing.

    (Our Newspaper News) While carrying out large-scale water conservancy construction, Heilongjiang Province has also mobilized 600,000 people to engage in a high tide of manure accumulation, fertilizer production, and manure delivery. By the end of last year, the province had accumulated and produced more than 1.3 trillion jin of fertilizer, and more than 150 billion jin of fertilizer had been delivered to deeply plowed land.

    The biggest difference between this year's manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement and previous years is that native fertilizer factories have been established all over the province. At present, there are more than 92,000 native fertilizer factories, granular fertilizer factories, and bacterial fertilizer factories throughout the province. These factories, established by rural people's communes, can produce 30 to 40 kinds of native fertilizer, and some factories have a daily output of up to 25,000 jin. At the same time, the mass movement of accumulating farm manure in rural areas throughout the province has also reached an unprecedented scale. According to incomplete statistics, Qinggang, Kedong, Zhaoyuan, Shuangcheng, Wuchang, and other 25 counties and cities have all achieved having sheds for cattle and horses, pens for pigs and sheep, sheds for chickens and ducks, toilets in every household, and manure pits in every village. In places with large areas of natural peat, people are vigorously developing peat fertilizer. After the Tailai County Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of the county's people's communes to study the use of peat for oil refining and fertilizer production, in just seven days, 286 blast furnaces for refining peat were built, producing more than 390 million jin of fertilizer. Nehe, Bei'an, and Keshan counties have established fertilizer factories from cities to villages, from government agencies to schools, from factories to enterprises, and from people's communes to production teams. In December 1958 alone, these three counties used peat to produce 633.5 billion jin of native fertilizer, which is equivalent to more than 47 million jin of ammonium sulfate, more than 30 million jin of superphosphate, and more than 20 million jin of potassium sulfate, equal to 2.3 times the total amount of fertilizer used in the province in 1958.

    Now, many places are taking fast manure delivery methods to speed up the delivery of winter manure. Durbet Mongol Autonomous County poured 30,000 meters long ice roads, manufactured more than 38,000 ice road manure delivery vehicles, implemented ice road train operations, and three people could push eight to ten manure vehicles at a time, which is five times more efficient than large vehicle manure delivery.

    利用草炭多制土化肥
    吉林和黑龙江群众千方百计提高肥料质量
    本报讯　吉林省以大挖草炭大熏土肥为主的冬季积肥运动，正全面形成高潮。到1月9日，全省每天参加积肥的人数已达五十九万多人，共积各种粪肥五亿一千多万吨。在大搞农家肥料的同时，各地还在继续调配人力，改革工具，大力挖掘草炭、制造土化肥和烧熏土肥。目前全省已挖出草炭二千五百七十八万吨，建土化肥厂二万多个，制造出土化肥六十九万多吨。
    吉林省草炭资源十分丰富，各县都有。各地群众在积肥辩论中，一致认为要保证今年农作物粪饱肥足，必须根据本地草炭多、人畜力少、农家肥料少等特点，大力挖掘草炭。九台县已找到五百多处草炭产地，目前已挖出五十四万八千吨。这个县二道河子人民公社由党委书记挂帅，组织了八百多人的挖草炭专业队，几天时间就挖草炭一万多吨。榆树县几乎到处都有草炭，中共榆树县委号召各公社紧紧依靠群众，大力挖草炭，并且随挖随送随发酵，目前已挖草炭五十四万吨。梨树县万发人民公社毕家堡子管理区在积肥运动中，抓住了以挖草炭为主带动其他积肥的方法，仅在去年11月至12月的四十天中，全管理区就挖草炭十二万五千吨。他们组织了挖草炭专业队，并且在挖掘、装卸、搬运等工序上实行专责制，大大提高了劳动效率。
    草炭经过加温发酵后，一般能提高肥效一半到一倍以上。目前各地群众已经创造出十多种草炭加温发酵方法。
    吉林省今年的积肥运动中，各地还根据柴草较多的情况，大力烧熏土肥。早在深翻地初期，双阳等县就用烧熏土肥的办法，解决了深翻地中施肥不足的困难。（李树功）
    本报讯　黑龙江省在进行大规模水利建设的同时，又有六十万人投入积肥、造肥和送粪高潮。到去年年底，全省已经积肥、造肥一万三千多亿斤，并有一千五百多亿斤肥料已送到经过深翻的土地上去。
    今年的积肥造肥运动与往年最大的不同，是全省遍地开办起土化肥厂。现在全省已有土化肥厂、颗粒肥料厂、细菌肥料厂九万二千多个。这些由农村人民公社兴办的工厂，能制造三、四十种土化肥，有的厂日产量达到二万五千多斤。与此同时，全省农村积攒农家肥的群众运动也达到了空前规模。据不完全统计，青冈、克东、肇源、双城、五常等二十五个县市，都做到牛马有棚、猪羊有圈、鸡鸭有棚，家家有厕所、村村有粪坑。在有着大片天然草炭的地方，人们就大搞草炭肥料。泰来县在中共县委召开全县人民公社党委书记学习使用草炭炼油造化肥的现场会议后，仅七天时间，就建起二百八十六个炼草炭的高炉，生产化肥三亿九千多万斤。讷河、北安、克山三个县从城市到乡村，从机关到学校，从工厂到企业，从人民公社到生产队，都建立起了化肥厂。仅这三个县1958年12月份用草炭制出的六千三百三十五亿斤土化肥，就相当于四千七百多万斤的硫酸铵，三千多万斤的过磷酸钙，和二千多万斤的硫酸钾，等于1958年全省使用化肥总量的二点三倍。
    现在，很多地方正采取快速送粪办法加紧送冬粪。杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县浇了长达三万公尺的冰道，制造了三万八千多辆冰道送粪车，实行冰道列车化，三个人一次可推八至十台粪车，比大车送粪效率高五倍。（附图片）
