Guarantee the Key Points, Support Baotou Steel

　　The Baotou Iron and Steel Complex is one of China's large-scale iron and steel bases under construction. Since the official commencement of construction in the summer of 1957, this enterprise has made rapid progress in factory construction under the correct leadership of the Party, the support of the people throughout the country, and the assistance of Soviet experts. This year, the workload and construction projects of Baotou Steel will be twice as large as last year; and it will gradually be put into production, not only producing iron and steel, but also producing large-sized steel products, contributing to the great task of producing 18 million tons of steel this year.

　　Large tasks, many projects, short time, and complex technology. These are the characteristics of Baotou Steel's production and construction this year. Building such a huge and technologically advanced modern enterprise to make it, along with Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, the backbone of China's iron and steel industry is of great significance. Having the experience of building Anshan Iron and Steel and other large modern enterprises, we are confident in completing the construction of Baotou Steel on schedule and with high quality, but it must also be recognized that the construction of such a large-scale iron and steel complex is not an easy task. In terms of construction materials alone, building Baotou Steel requires approximately 400,000 tons of steel, with more than 5,000 varieties, approximately 400,000 tons of various cements, approximately 1.2 million cubic meters of concrete, and more than 20,000 varieties of various hardware, electrical materials, and equipment. These equipment and materials, in addition to foreign orders, are almost entirely sourced domestically. This situation reflects the close relationship between production across the country and the construction of Baotou Steel. How to support Baotou Steel across the country, providing the necessary equipment and materials as quickly as possible, is the key to completing Baotou Steel.

　　Our construction policy is to simultaneously develop large, medium, and small enterprises, with large enterprises as the key, building both large and small and medium-sized enterprises, so that the speed will be faster. Large enterprises, with their modern equipment, advanced technology, and large concentration of workers, are the backbone driving the comprehensive development of China's industrial production and construction, and are the bases for producing modern industrial products and training laborers with modern industrial technical knowledge. Therefore, although the construction time for large enterprises is longer and the investment is greater, it is absolutely necessary. Without this modern, large-scale backbone industry, we cannot rapidly improve China's industrial level. "Large, foreign, and mass" and "small, indigenous, and mass" are inherently two legs, a unity of opposites, mutually promoting each other rather than mutually excluding each other. Walking on two legs, missing one of them would turn into "Iron-Crutch Li," which is not conducive to the high-speed development of our iron and steel industry and other industries.

　　Large backbone enterprises are the focus of national construction, and we must provide support and guarantees to all key enterprises and key projects in the country when needed and possible, and the construction of Baotou Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel in the iron and steel industry especially needs support and guarantees. People all know the principle of taking steel as the key link to drive everything else, and steel is the pillar of industry. Under China's current specific conditions, every 100 million yuan invested in construction and installation work requires approximately 22,000 tons of steel; the machinery manufacturing industry requires approximately 15,000 tons of steel for every 100 million yuan increase in output value; and the development of other industries cannot be separated from steel. Since we hope that steel will drive everything, we must first ensure the rapid development of the iron and steel industry.

　　Key enterprises and key projects need to be guaranteed, and the construction tasks in various regions are also heavy. How should we treat this problem? Our principle is: guarantee the key points, take care of the general, so that the national economy can develop in a planned and proportionate way. Any region or department must subordinate local interests to the overall interests when dealing with the construction of key enterprises, and must promote the communist spirit of mutual support, cooperation, and common development. Our socialist construction is a planned and unified whole, and the mass movement of the whole people running industry and the principle of centralized leadership and unified planning by the state in construction, that is, the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," are not contradictory. Only by mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties and forming a mass movement of the whole people running industry can we ensure the realization of the national plan; only under the unified plan of "the whole country as one chessboard" can we ensure the completion of key construction and the production of key enterprises, and thus guarantee the continuous development of the mass movement of the whole people running industry. The production and construction plans of key enterprises are the backbone of the national industry. Only by building up key industries can we more effectively guarantee the continued development of other enterprises; only when the production and construction plans of key enterprises are completed can the overall surge of the national economy be fundamentally guaranteed. Baotou Steel is one of the key construction projects in the country and an important move in the overall chessboard of the country. The completion of Baotou Steel will have extremely important significance for accelerating the process of national industrialization and changing the economic landscape of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

　　In the past few years, under the unified leadership of the Central Government, the relevant regions, departments, and units have provided significant support for the construction of Baotou Steel. Since the Great Leap Forward, although the tasks of various departments and regions have been very heavy, their support for Baotou Steel has been quite attentive. As Baotou Steel has a heavy construction task this year, and the production and construction tasks of various regions and departments are also very heavy, it is required that various regions, enterprises, and departments that have cooperative relationships with Baotou Steel, such as railways, electricity, and coal, give strong support to Baotou Steel in the spirit of supporting key enterprises in the past. We believe that all departments, under the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," will certainly be able to provide better support.

　　Now the people of the whole country are paying attention to Baotou Steel, and all parts of the country will vigorously support Baotou Steel. The glorious task of all the staff and workers who are building Baotou Steel is to, under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, with the support and encouragement of the people of the whole country, and with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, put politics in command, exert full efforts to plant the red flag high, and carry out the mass movement more deeply, in order to mobilize all positive factors, tap all potentials, accelerate the construction of Baotou Steel, and strive to ensure the early production of iron, steel, and large-sized steel products in 1959! We believe that all the staff and workers of Baotou Steel will be able to achieve this glorious task.

    保证重点  支援包钢
    包头钢铁联合企业是我国建设的大型钢铁基地之一。从1957年夏季正式开始建设以来，这个企业在党的正确领导、全国人民的支援和苏联专家的帮助下，在建厂工作方面已经获得了迅速的进展。今年，包钢的建设工作量和工程项目将比去年大两倍；并且逐步投入生产，不仅要出铁出钢，还要生产大型钢材，为国家今年生产一千八百万吨钢的伟大任务贡献一部分力量。
    任务大，项目多，时间短，技术复杂。这是今年包钢生产建设的几个特点。建设这样一个规模巨大、技术水平很高的现代化的企业，使它同鞍钢、武钢一起成为我国钢铁工业的骨干是有重大意义的。由于有了建设鞍钢及其他大型的现代化企业的经验，我们是有信心如期如质地完成包钢的建设，但是，也必须看到，这样大规模的钢铁联合企业的建设，并不是轻而易举的事情。单单以建设材料来说，把包钢建设起来，大约需要钢材四十万吨左右，钢材品种共计五千多种，需要各种水泥四十万吨左右，需要混凝土一百二十万立方公尺左右，需要各种五金、电器材料和设备两万多种，这些设备和材料，除了国外订货以外，国内订货几乎遍及全国各地。这种情况，反映了全国各地的生产同包钢建设有着紧密的关系。全国各地如何支援包钢，尽先提供必要的设备和材料，这是建成包钢的关键所在。
    我们的建设方针是以大型企业为纲的大中小型企业同时并举，既建设大的，又建设中小的，这样速度就快。大型企业由于具有现代化设备、先进技术和工人大量集中等优越条件，是带动我国工业生产建设全面发展的脊骨，是生产现代工业产品和培养具有现代工业技术知识的劳动者的基地。因此，大型企业的建设的时间虽然长一些，投资虽然多一些，却是十分必要的。没有这种现代化的大型的骨干工业，我们就无法迅速提高我国的工业水平。“大、洋、群”和“小、土、群”，本来是两条腿，是对立的统一，是互相促进，而不是互相排斥的。两条腿走路，缺了那一条，都会变成“铁拐李”，都不利于我们钢铁工业和其他工业的高速度发展。
    大型骨干企业是国家建设的重点，全国一切重点企业和重点工程，在需要而且可能的时候，我们都要给以支援和保证，而钢铁企业中的包钢、武钢的建设尤其需要支援和保证。人们都知道以钢为纲、带动一切的道理，钢铁是工业的支柱。在我国目前的具体条件下，每投资一亿元的建筑安装工作量，大约就需要二万二千吨钢材；机器制造工业每提高一亿元产值就需要大约一万五千吨钢材；其他工业的发展，都不能离开钢铁。我们既然希望钢来带动一切，首先就要保证钢铁工业迅速发展。
    重点企业和重点工程需要保证，而各地区的建设任务也很繁重，怎样对待这个问题呢？我们的原则是：保证重点，照顾一般，使国民经济有计划按比例地发展。任何地区、部门，在对待重点企业建设的时候，都必须将局部利益服从整体利益，必须发扬相互支援、相互协作、共同发展的共产主义精神。我们的社会主义建设是一个有计划的统一的整体，全民办工业的群众运动和国家在建设中的集中领导、统一计划的原则，也就是“全国一盘棋”的原则，是不矛盾的。只有调动各方面的积极性，形成全民办工业的群众运动，才能保证国家计划的实现；只有在“全国一盘棋”的统一计划之下，确保重点建设的完成和重点企业的生产，才能保证全民办工业的群众运动不断向前发展。重点企业的生产建设计划，是全国工业的骨干。只有把重点工业建设起来，才能更有力地保障其他企业的继续发展；只有重点企业的生产建设计划完成了，整个国民经济的高涨才能有基本的保证。包钢是全国建设的重点项目之一，是全国一盘棋的重要一着。包钢的建成，对于加速国家工业化进程和改变内蒙古自治区经济面貌将有极其重大的意义。
    过去几年中，在中央统一领导下，各有关地区、有关部门、有关单位曾对包钢建设作了重大的支援。大跃进以来，各部门、各地区虽然任务很繁重，但对包钢的支援也还是相当注意了的。由于包钢今年的建设任务很大，各地区、各部门生产建设的任务也很大，因此要求同包钢有协作关系的各地区、各企业、各部门如铁道、电力、煤炭等协作单位，本着过去支援重点企业的精神，给包钢以大力支援。我们相信各部门在“全国一盘棋”的原则下，一定能支援得更好。
    现在全国人民都在瞩目包钢，全国各地也将大力支援包钢。建设包钢的全体职工的光荣任务，就是要在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，在全国人民的支持和鼓舞下，在苏联的真诚援助下，政治挂帅，鼓足干劲高插红旗，更深入地开展群众运动，以便调动一切积极因素，挖掘一切潜力，加速包钢建设，为确保在1959年内早日出铁、出钢、出大型钢材而奋斗！我们相信，包钢的全体职工一定能够实现这个光荣任务。
