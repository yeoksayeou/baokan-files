    No Need to Force It
    Qin Li
    Recently, I saw some advertisements for tutorial schools on the street that had added a new course: "How to Write Poetry." There were day, night, and weekend classes, as if attending a few days of tutoring could cultivate poets.
    At the time, I didn't necessarily think it was impossible, but I wondered more about what these tutorial schools could actually teach. Do people just create poems in their spare time after work and labor? Of course, it also made me think that opening this course was a bit like old tutorial schools, overly focused on business.
    Then I thought about a poem I saw some time ago written by a child. It was said that the child's father thought his son had a talent for writing poetry and wanted to cultivate him into a great poet, so he forced the child to write poetry, submitting one poem every day. The child wrote a lot (maybe some were copied), and one poem I read can be said to be brilliant because it came from the child's heart. The poem reads:
    "Dad wants poems when he gets home, scolds me for being lazy and not human,
    I'm not a silkworm turning, where would I get so much silk from my belly!"
    From this lovely child's poem, I returned to the matter of tutorial classes offering poetry courses. I think anyone can write poetry, but there's no need for everyone to "force themselves" to write poetry!

    不必硬挤

    最近在街头上看到一些补习学校贴的招生广告里，又增开了一项新课目：“怎样写诗”，而且有日夜班、假日班，好像补习上几天就能培养出诗人来了。
    我当时并没想到这一定是不可能的事，但是我想得更多的却是，这补习学校究竟能讲些什么？人们在工作劳动之余，光是闹创作诗吗？当然也让我想到，开这课的未免有点像旧补习学校似的过于看重生意眼了。
    于是我又联想到前些时候看到一个孩子写的诗，据说孩子的父亲认为自己的儿子有写诗的天才，要培养他成为大诗人，总是逼着孩子写诗，每天交一首。孩子写了不少（也可能有抄来的），我读到的一诗可以说是绝妙的，因为它发自孩子的心声。诗写道：
    “爸爸回家就要诗，骂我贪玩不是人，
    我又不是蚕子变，肚里哪有浪多丝！”
    从这个可爱的孩子的诗里，我又回想到补习班开诗课的事，我看诗是人人可以写的，但是不必人人“硬挤着”写诗吧！
