The Tito clique, while still waving the banners of so-called "active coexistence," "non-alignment," and "peaceful neutrality," and using every opportunity to deceive and swindle, can no longer hide its true face. Not only the proletariat and working people of the world, but also all peace-loving countries and people, can easily see from a series of actions and statements of the Tito clique that it is actually a disguised tool serving the imperialist policy of aggression.

Here, we might as well review the words and deeds of the Tito clique in the struggle in the Taiwan Straits area since August 1958. The Tito clique, which serves as an apologist for imperialist aggressive forces, has clearly exposed its true colors in this struggle.

From the very beginning, it was obvious which side the Tito clique was on. Since the end of August, Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals have published a large number of dispatches and reports from Western news agencies such as the U.S. and British, published many photos showing off the military power of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, and published statements and talks by Eisenhower and Dulles on aggression and war provocation against China. For example, the Yugoslav "Borba" published a report by Western news agencies on Dulles's talk as early as August 24. This talk viciously slandered the punitive blows of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front against the Chiang army. What is particularly absurd is that the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals actually regarded the Taiwan Kuomintang clique, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people, as a country. From August 24, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals have continuously published so-called "National Defense Ministry of the Chiang Kai-shek Government" communiqués. It is now difficult to find out how much difference there is between the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals and the newspapers and periodicals of the American monopoly capital.

In addition to this kind of reporting that publicizes the American aggressors, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals have also published many comments and articles on the struggle situation in the Taiwan Straits area. From these strange articles, we can further understand what kind of stuff the Tito clique is.

Many of the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals' commentaries echoed the reactionary American newspapers and periodicals. They slandered the just struggle of the Chinese people against American aggression as creating "tension" and "sharpening" international relations. On August 26, the Slovenian "Messenger" wrote in its commentary "Sharpening of the Far East Situation": China "deliberately chose this time. China's intention is to sharpen relations in that part of the world." This newspaper wrote even more blatantly on September 9: "This sharpening of the situation was caused by the People's Republic of China itself," "Every action that sharpens the situation must be condemned," "China's actions are a threat to peace." Look, the Tito clique is so shamelessly standing on the aggressive position of U.S. imperialism to oppose the People's China!

According to the Tito clique's point of view, the United States directly occupying China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands by force, and arming the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out harassment and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland, all of this is not the cause of tension, nor is it a threat to peace in the Far East and the world; instead, the invaded Chinese people are "creating tension"!

According to the same logic, then, when the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the Indonesian government demanded the recovery of West Irian, the Lebanese people opposed Chamoun, and the Iraqi people overthrew Faisal, they were all "creating tension"!

In order to confuse right and wrong and cover up the crimes of the imperialist policy of war and aggression, the Tito clique also described the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and for the liberation of their own territorial lands as the result of "the world being divided into two major hostile military-political blocs" and the so-called "bloc politics." According to the Yugoslav "Foreign Bulletin" on September 4, the rumbling guns on the front lines of Jinmen are causing "the conflict of blocs to lead to danger again."

This fallacy of the Tito clique is really too shameless. The Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries has a history of more than one hundred years. The Chinese people have indeed learned from their own struggles that there is a "bloc," that is, the imperialist aggressive bloc that has been trying to carve up China. This imperialist aggressive bloc had already done many bad things to the Chinese people and the people of the world many years before the birth of the socialist camp. They are waging aggressive wars everywhere and creating tensions everywhere, not because there is a socialist camp in the world, let alone the result of any "bloc politics." The Chinese people's just struggle for the Taiwan issue is the sacred cause of the Chinese people against imperialist aggression and for the reunification of the motherland. Yes, all countries in the socialist camp have expressed great sympathy and support for this just struggle of the Chinese people; all peace-loving countries and people in the world have also expressed great sympathy and support for this just struggle of the Chinese people. This kind of sympathy and support has nothing to do with the "bloc politics" that the Tito clique said. The Tito clique openly opposes the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, and opposes the sympathy and support of all countries in the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries and people in the world for the Chinese people, by opposing what they call "bloc politics." This only shows that the Tito clique is not "super-bloc," "non-bloc," but stubbornly stands on the side of the imperialist aggressive bloc, and stubbornly opposes the just struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world against imperialist aggression.

The Tito clique echoed the American aggressors and tried their best to pretend to be very concerned about peace while slandering the Chinese people's just struggle. The Slovenian "Messenger's" commentary "New Hotbed" on August 26 wrote: "It is very obvious that the world needs peace more than the People's Republic of China needs Formosa." The Yugoslav "Liberation Daily" wrote on September 7: "People have the right to ask: Is the fate of Jinmen, a coastal island of China, worth throwing millions of people into the disaster of war? Is the world going to be involved in war for Jinmen?" On September 9, the newspaper openly warned China "not to play with fire that could burn the whole world." These shameless lies are also completely parroting Dulles. In order to realize their aggressive conspiracies, the imperialists always shout about "maintaining peace" and "renouncing the use of force," but in fact they always remember to realize their aggressive purposes. The Tito clique is a salesman of this kind of stuff. They do not ask the aggressors to stop their aggression, but instead threaten the aggressed to accept the aggression obediently; they do not ask the arsonists to stop arson, but instead threaten the victims not to resist, and should not carry out the struggle to extinguish the fire, otherwise, they will be convicted of "sabotaging peace." It turns out that the "peace" clamored by the Tito clique is the "peace" that promotes the aggressors, and the "peace" that promotes the war-mongers!

The Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals also put on the face of missionaries, preaching for the interests of U.S. imperialism, and talking about "reconciliation" and "concessions." The "Political Daily" wrote on September 10: "Whether it is China and the United States, as well as the whole world, can only benefit from mutual concessions and understanding, and further aggravating the situation cannot benefit anyone." The "Borba" also wrote on September 17: "It is precisely the dangerous development of events that orders both sides to show the greatest possible goodwill in order to avoid further complications." What exactly does the "reconciliation" and "tolerance" chanted by the Tito clique refer to? The Slovenian "Messenger" answered on August 26, saying: "If the mainland launches an attack, especially if this action means the prelude to the landing of troops, the United States will not tolerate it." The "Political Daily" on September 3 also wrote: "If the Chinese side continues to exert military pressure, no one can say what will happen." According to these statements by the Tito clique's mouthpiece, the Chinese people can only "tolerate" the armed provocations of the United States, and must not resist; otherwise, the American masters will not tolerate it. If the Chinese people dare to "continue to exert military pressure," a catastrophe will befall them. It is worth noting that here, the Tito clique is so loyal to U.S. imperialism that it forgets to disguise itself, and directly uses the tone of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to threaten the Chinese people when speaking. May I ask: How do the commentators of the Tito clique know so clearly whether the United States will "tolerate" it? Did someone in Washington authorize them to make such remarks?

Following the intentions of their masters, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals also tried their best to promote so-called "mediation" of the Taiwan issue by the United Nations. The Zagreb "Free Home" newspaper wrote on September 8: "Just as mediation by the United Nations was necessary in the Middle East, mediation in Asia and other places may also be necessary." The Zagreb "News" also wrote on September 19: "In any case, the conflict in the Formosa Strait will also be discussed in the United Nations." As everyone knows, according to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has no right to interfere in matters belonging to the internal affairs of a country. If the United Nations really wants to perform its duties of maintaining world peace and security, it does have something to do, that is, it should severely condemn the United States' aggressive behavior against China, and ask the United States to immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. However, it seems that this United Nations is still far from being able to do this kind of serious thing. Why is the Tito clique now impatiently promoting United Nations mediation? It is obvious that this practice of the Tito clique is only creating public opinion for imperialist interference in China's internal affairs.

In order to help the U.S. reactionary propaganda, the Tito clique also copied many words and phrases from the U.S. State Department to slander the Chinese people. In order to slander the Chinese people's "leap forward" and the great people's commune movement, they even insisted that China's interior has great "difficulties." According to the description of the Tito clique's newspapers, the situation in China is simply extremely bad. The Tito clique even said in the Zagreb "News" on October 15 that mankind has never "experienced such a degree of bureaucratic degradation and dehumanization as the People's Republic of China is now experiencing." The "Borba" also published lengthy reports slandering our people's communes. On October 23, Tito himself came out to attack. He made a speech in Novo Mesto, once again making shameless slanders against socialist countries. When mentioning China, Tito said: "They have some difficulties, and the difficulties are very big, ... they hope to overcome these difficulties, and sometimes they find ways outside their own country." Tito also wantonly slandered the people's communes, which were built on a voluntary basis by more than 99% of farmers in our country, saying that they are "military communes" and "have little in common with the Marxist concept of socialist construction."

Of course, all these slanders can never detract from the Chinese people's great achievements; on the contrary, they only show the world that the Tito clique has degenerated into Dulles's pawn, and degenerated to the point of singing a duet with the American reactionaries. Dulles said: "Under China's 'commune' system, human personality and dignity are to be denied, and he (she) is only regarded as a material unit." The Tito clique said: "In China, millions of people are turned into machines." Dulles said: China is imposing a kind of "backward, large-scale slavery called communes on 650 million Chinese people." The Tito clique said: The Chinese people are suffering from "dehumanizing" rule. Dulles said: "The Chinese Communist rulers realize that what they are doing will surely arouse the hatred of the Chinese people, so they try to divert this hatred from themselves and target foreigners." Tito said that China is encountering great "difficulties" and that in order to "overcome these difficulties," it is necessary to "find ways outside their own country." Look, their remarks are so consistent that it would be easy to interchange their names without any difficulty.

In the minds of imperialists like Dulles, it is called "having personality" and "having dignity" for the Chinese people to obediently accept the rule of imperialism and feudalism; and it is called "slavery" for the liberated Chinese people to work hard to build their own country. The logic of imperialism can only be like this. But why is it that the tone of the Tito clique, which claims to be Marxists and socialists, is exactly the same as that of the imperialists? It turns out that in order to please their masters, lackeys have to follow their masters and work for them. This is why the people of the world hate the running dogs of imperialism as much as they hate the imperialists.

The Tito clique's various remarks on the Taiwan issue are only a small part of the Tito clique's distortion and slander of the Chinese people's just struggle, and serving the imperialist policy of aggression. However, from this small part of the material, it is enough to see the face of this traitorous clique. Paper cannot wrap fire, and disguise cannot hide the original face. Objective facts are more powerful than any sophistry. Under the magnifying glass of facts, modern revisionists cannot but show their true colors.

    照妖镜下显原形
    铁托集团在台湾问题上的立场说明了什么？
    李亚
    铁托集团虽然还打着所谓“积极共处”、“非集团”、“和平中立”政策等等旗号，并且利用各种机会招摇撞骗，但是它的真实面貌已经愈来愈掩藏不住了。不但全世界无产阶级和劳动人民，而且一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都不难从铁托集团的一系列言行中看出，它实际上只是为帝国主义侵略政策服务的一种改头换面的工具。
    我们在这里不妨回顾一下从1958年8月以来铁托集团在台湾海峡地区斗争中的言行。为帝国主义侵略势力帮腔的铁托集团，在这场斗争中，明明白白地暴露了它的原形。
    在这场斗争中，铁托集团站在哪一边，从一开始就是很明显的。8月底以来，南斯拉夫报刊对于台湾海峡地区的形势，大量地发表了美、英西方通讯社的电讯和报道，刊登了不少炫耀美蒋军事威力的照片，并且还刊登了艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯对中国进行侵略和战争挑衅的声明和谈话。例如，南斯拉夫“战斗报”早在8月24日就刊登了西方通讯社所报道的杜勒斯谈话，这个谈话极其恶毒地诬蔑我国福建前线解放军对于蒋军的惩罚性打击。尤其荒谬的是，铁托集团的报刊竟然把久已被中国人民唾弃了的台湾国民党集团当成一个国家看待。从8月24日起，铁托集团的报刊就不断登载所谓“蒋介石政府国防部”的公报。人们已经很难找出铁托集团的报刊同美国垄断资本的报刊究竟有多少区别。
    除了这种为美国侵略者张目的报道以外，铁托集团的报刊还发表了不少关于台湾海峡地区斗争形势的评论和文章。从这些奇文中，可以进一步认识铁托集团是一种什么货色。
    铁托集团报刊的许多评论，都是同美国反动报刊互相唱和的。它们诬蔑中国人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争，是制造“紧张局势”，使国际关系“尖锐化”。8月26日，斯洛文尼亚
  “信使报”在评论“远东局势尖锐化”的时候写道：中国“是故意选择这个时机的。中国的意图就是要使世界那部分地区的关系尖锐化”。这张报纸在9月9日更露骨地写道：“这个局势的尖锐化是中华人民共和国自己造成的”，
  “必须谴责每一个使局势尖锐化的行动”，“中国的行动是对和平的威胁”。请看，铁托集团就是这样不顾廉耻地站在美帝国主义的侵略立场上来反对人民中国！
    按照铁托集团的观点，美国直接用武力侵占中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛，武装蒋介石集团对中国大陆进行骚扰和破坏活动，这一切都不是造成紧张局势的原因，都不是对远东和世界和平的威胁；反而是被侵略的中国人民在“制造紧张局势”！
    按照同样的逻辑，那么，当埃及政府宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，印尼政府要求收复西伊里安，黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙，伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔的时候，他们都是在“制造紧张局势”了！
    铁托集团为了混淆是非，为帝国主义的战争侵略政策掩饰罪过，还把中国人民反对帝国主义侵略、解放自己祖国领土的斗争，说成是“世界分裂为两大敌对的军事政治集团”和所谓“集团政策”的结果。照9月4日南斯拉夫“外交公报”的说法，金门前线的隆隆炮声，正在使得“集团的冲突又导致危险”。
    铁托集团的这种谬论，真是太无耻了。中国人民反对帝国主义和国内反动派的英勇斗争，已经有一百多年的历史了。中国人民从自己的斗争中确实知道有一个“集团”，那就是处心积虑、企图瓜分中国的帝国主义侵略集团。这个帝国主义侵略集团早在社会主义阵营诞生以前的好多年，就已经对中国人民和世界人民做了许多坏事。它们到处进行侵略战争，到处制造紧张局势，并不是因为世界上存在社会主义阵营，更不是什么“集团政策”的结果。中国人民对于台湾问题的正义斗争，是中国人民反对帝国主义侵略和统一祖国的神圣事业。是的，所有社会主义阵营各国都对中国人民的这一正义斗争，表示了极大的同情和支持；全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民，也都对于中国人民的这一正义斗争，表示了极大的同情和支持。这种同情和支持，同铁托集团所说的“集团政策”根本是风马牛不相及的。铁托集团公然以什么反对“集团政策”来反对中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，来反对社会主义阵营各国和全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民对于中国人民的同情和支持，只不过说明了铁托集团并不是什么“超集团”的、“非集团”的，而是顽固地站在帝国主义侵略集团方面，顽固地敌视中国人民和世界人民反抗帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。
    铁托集团同美国侵略者一呼一应，在诬蔑中国人民正义斗争的时候，竭力把自己装成是十分关心和平的样子。8月26日斯洛文尼亚“信使报”的评论“新的温床”一文中就写道：“十分明显，世界需要和平，更胜于中华人民共和国需要福摩萨。”9月7日南斯拉夫“解放报”写道：“人们有权发问：一个中国沿海岛屿金门的命运是否值得把千百万人投入战争灾祸中去？为了金门是否要世界卷入战争？”9月9日该报竟公开警告中国“不要进行可能燃烧全世界的玩火”。这些无耻谰言，也完全是跟杜勒斯学舌的。帝国主义者为了实现他们的侵略阴谋，总是叫喊什么“维护和平”呀，“放弃使用武力”呀，而实际上则是时刻记住要实现它的侵略目的。铁托集团正是这一套货色的推销员，他们不要求侵略者停止侵略，反而威吓被侵略者要乖乖地接受侵略；不要求放火者停止放火，反而威吓被害者不得抵抗，不应该进行灭火的斗争，否则，就要定下“破坏和平”之罪。原来铁托集团叫嚣的“和平”，就是为侵略者张目的“和平”，为战争贩子张目的“和平”！
    铁托集团的报刊还摆出一副传教士的面孔，为美帝国主义侵略的利益说教，大谈什么“和解”和“让步”。9月10日“政治报”写道：“不论中国和美国以及全世界，都只能从互相让步和谅解中得到好处，而进一步加剧局势不可能使任何人得到好处。”9月17日“战斗报”也写道：“正是事件的危险发展，责令双方表现出最大可能的善良愿望，以便避免进一步的复杂化。”铁托集团所高唱的“和解”和“容忍”究竟指的是什么呢？8月26日斯洛文尼亚“信使报”就做了回答，它说：“如果大陆发动攻击，特别是这种行动意味着军队登陆的前奏，美国是不会容忍的。”9月3日的“政治报”也写道：“如果中国方面继续施加军事压力，谁也不能说将会发生些什么。”按照铁托集团的喉舌的这些说法，对于美国的武装挑衅，中国人民只能“容忍”，决不能反抗；否则，美国老爷就不能容忍了。中国人民如果胆敢“继续施加军事压力”，就要大祸临头了。值得注意的是，在这里，铁托集团对美帝国主义如此忠心耿耿，以致忘记了化装，在说话的时候直接用起美国国务卿杜勒斯威胁中国人民的腔调来了。试问：美国会不会“容忍”，铁托集团的评论家怎么知道得这样清楚呢？是华盛顿的什么人授权他们发表这样的谈话么？
    铁托集团的报刊秉承主子的意旨，还竭力鼓吹由联合国对台湾问题进行所谓“调解”。9月8日的萨格勒布“自由之家”报写道：“正如联合国在中东的调解是必要的，在亚洲和其他地方进行调解可能也是必要的。”9月19日的萨格勒布“消息报”也写道：“无论如何，福摩萨海峡的冲突，也一定将在联合国内讨论。”大家知道，根据联合国宪章，联合国根本无权过问属于一国内政的问题。联合国如果真想执行维护世界和平和安全的职责，它倒是有事做的，那就是应当严厉谴责美国对中国的侵略行为，要美国从台湾和台湾海峡立即撤出它的侵略军队。可是，看来这个联合国距离能做这种正经事的地步还差得很远。铁托集团现在却急不可耐地鼓吹什么联合国调解，这是为什么呢？很明显，铁托集团的这种做法，只不过是为帝国主义干涉中国内政制造舆论罢了。
    为了替美国反动宣传帮腔，铁托集团还从美国国务院那里抄袭了许多诬蔑中国人民的词句。他们为了诬蔑中国人民“一日千里”的大跃进和伟大的人民公社化运动，竟然硬说：中国的内部具有极大的“困难”。按照铁托集团报纸的描绘，中国的情况简直不妙到极点了。铁托集团在10月15日的萨格勒布“消息报”上甚至说，人类从来“没有经历过像中华人民共和国现在所经历的这种程度的官僚主义退化和非人道化”。“战斗报”也刊载了诬蔑我国人民公社的长篇报道。10月23日，铁托亲自出马来攻击了。他在诺沃梅斯托发表演说，再一次对社会主义国家进行无耻的诬蔑。在提到中国的时候，铁托说：“他们有一些困难，而且困难是很大的，……他们希望越过这些困难，有时候他们在他们自己国家以外的地方想办法。”铁托还放肆地诬蔑我国的99％以上的农户在自愿的基础上建成的人民公社，说它们是“军事公社”，“同马克思主义的社会主义建设观念没有多少共同之处”。
    当然，所有这一切诬蔑，绝不能使中国人民的伟大成就有丝毫减色；相反的，只不过是向全世界表明铁托集团已经堕落成为杜勒斯的走卒，堕落到同美国反动派唱对口相声的地步。杜勒斯说：“在中国的‘公社’制度下，人的个性和人格是要予以否定的，他（她）只被看作是一个物质单位。”铁托集团说：“在中国把千百万人变成机器”。杜勒斯说：中国正在把一种“名字叫做公社的、落后的、大规模的奴隶制度强加在六亿五千万中国人民的头上”。铁托集团说：中国人民遭受着“非人道化”的统治。杜勒斯说：“中国共产党统治者认识到，他们正在作的事情一定会引起中国人民的仇恨，因此，他们设法把这种仇恨从他们自己身上转移开去，而针对着外国人。”铁托说，中国正遇到极大的“困难”，并且为了“越过这些困难”，要在“自己国家以外的地方想办法”。请看，他们的言论竟是如此一致，把他们的名字对调一下，也简直不会引起什么困难。
    在杜勒斯这样的帝国主义者的心目中，中国人民一定要老老实实地接受帝国主义、封建主义的统治，那才叫做“有个性”和“有人格”；而解放了的中国人民奋发努力建设自己的国家，那就叫做“奴隶制度”。帝国主义的逻辑当然只能是这样。但是，为什么自称为马克思主义者、社会主义者的铁托集团的腔调，也同帝国主义者一模一样？原来，奴才为了向主子讨赏，就不得不跟着主子学舌，为主子效驰驱之劳。这就是全世界人民为什么厌恶帝国主义的走狗同厌恶帝国主义者一样的缘故了。
    铁托集团对于台湾问题的各种言论，只是铁托集团歪曲、诬蔑中国人民的正义斗争，为帝国主义侵略政策效劳的许多谬论的一小部分。然而，从这一小部分材料已经足够看出这个叛徒集团的嘴脸。纸包不住火，伪装不能遮尽本来面目。客观事实比任何诡辩更有力。在事实这面照妖镜下面，现代修正主义者不能不显出原形。
