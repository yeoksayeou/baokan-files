The Tito clique, while still waving the banners of so-called "active coexistence," "non-alignment," and "peaceful neutrality," and using every opportunity to deceive and swindle, can no longer hide its true face. Not only the proletariat and working people of the world, but also all peace-loving countries and people, can easily see from a series of actions and statements of the Tito clique that it is actually a disguised tool serving the imperialist policy of aggression.

Here, we might as well review the words and deeds of the Tito clique in the struggle in the Taiwan Straits area since August 1958. The Tito clique, which serves as an apologist for imperialist aggressive forces, has clearly exposed its true colors in this struggle.

From the very beginning, it was obvious which side the Tito clique was on. Since the end of August, Yugoslav newspapers and periodicals have published a large number of dispatches and reports from Western news agencies such as the U.S. and British, published many photos showing off the military power of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, and published statements and talks by Eisenhower and Dulles on aggression and war provocation against China. For example, the Yugoslav "Borba" published a report by Western news agencies on Dulles's talk as early as August 24. This talk viciously slandered the punitive blows of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front against the Chiang army. What is particularly absurd is that the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals actually regarded the Taiwan Kuomintang clique, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people, as a country. From August 24, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals have continuously published so-called "National Defense Ministry of the Chiang Kai-shek Government" communiqu√©s. It is now difficult to find out how much difference there is between the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals and the newspapers and periodicals of the American monopoly capital.

In addition to this kind of reporting that publicizes the American aggressors, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals have also published many comments and articles on the struggle situation in the Taiwan Straits area. From these strange articles, we can further understand what kind of stuff the Tito clique is.

Many of the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals' commentaries echoed the reactionary American newspapers and periodicals. They slandered the just struggle of the Chinese people against American aggression as creating "tension" and "sharpening" international relations. On August 26, the Slovenian "Messenger" wrote in its commentary "Sharpening of the Far East Situation": China "deliberately chose this time. China's intention is to sharpen relations in that part of the world." This newspaper wrote even more blatantly on September 9: "This sharpening of the situation was caused by the People's Republic of China itself," "Every action that sharpens the situation must be condemned," "China's actions are a threat to peace." Look, the Tito clique is so shamelessly standing on the aggressive position of U.S. imperialism to oppose the People's China!

According to the Tito clique's point of view, the United States directly occupying China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands by force, and arming the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out harassment and sabotage activities against the Chinese mainland, all of this is not the cause of tension, nor is it a threat to peace in the Far East and the world; instead, the invaded Chinese people are "creating tension"!

According to the same logic, then, when the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the Indonesian government demanded the recovery of West Irian, the Lebanese people opposed Chamoun, and the Iraqi people overthrew Faisal, they were all "creating tension"!

In order to confuse right and wrong and cover up the crimes of the imperialist policy of war and aggression, the Tito clique also described the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and for the liberation of their own territorial lands as the result of "the world being divided into two major hostile military-political blocs" and the so-called "bloc politics." According to the Yugoslav "Foreign Bulletin" on September 4, the rumbling guns on the front lines of Jinmen are causing "the conflict of blocs to lead to danger again."

This fallacy of the Tito clique is really too shameless. The Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries has a history of more than one hundred years. The Chinese people have indeed learned from their own struggles that there is a "bloc," that is, the imperialist aggressive bloc that has been trying to carve up China. This imperialist aggressive bloc had already done many bad things to the Chinese people and the people of the world many years before the birth of the socialist camp. They are waging aggressive wars everywhere and creating tensions everywhere, not because there is a socialist camp in the world, let alone the result of any "bloc politics." The Chinese people's just struggle for the Taiwan issue is the sacred cause of the Chinese people against imperialist aggression and for the reunification of the motherland. Yes, all countries in the socialist camp have expressed great sympathy and support for this just struggle of the Chinese people; all peace-loving countries and people in the world have also expressed great sympathy and support for this just struggle of the Chinese people. This kind of sympathy and support has nothing to do with the "bloc politics" that the Tito clique said. The Tito clique openly opposes the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, and opposes the sympathy and support of all countries in the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries and people in the world for the Chinese people, by opposing what they call "bloc politics." This only shows that the Tito clique is not "super-bloc," "non-bloc," but stubbornly stands on the side of the imperialist aggressive bloc, and stubbornly opposes the just struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world against imperialist aggression.

The Tito clique echoed the American aggressors and tried their best to pretend to be very concerned about peace while slandering the Chinese people's just struggle. The Slovenian "Messenger's" commentary "New Hotbed" on August 26 wrote: "It is very obvious that the world needs peace more than the People's Republic of China needs Formosa." The Yugoslav "Liberation Daily" wrote on September 7: "People have the right to ask: Is the fate of Jinmen, a coastal island of China, worth throwing millions of people into the disaster of war? Is the world going to be involved in war for Jinmen?" On September 9, the newspaper openly warned China "not to play with fire that could burn the whole world." These shameless lies are also completely parroting Dulles. In order to realize their aggressive conspiracies, the imperialists always shout about "maintaining peace" and "renouncing the use of force," but in fact they always remember to realize their aggressive purposes. The Tito clique is a salesman of this kind of stuff. They do not ask the aggressors to stop their aggression, but instead threaten the aggressed to accept the aggression obediently; they do not ask the arsonists to stop arson, but instead threaten the victims not to resist, and should not carry out the struggle to extinguish the fire, otherwise, they will be convicted of "sabotaging peace." It turns out that the "peace" clamored by the Tito clique is the "peace" that promotes the aggressors, and the "peace" that promotes the war-mongers!

The Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals also put on the face of missionaries, preaching for the interests of U.S. imperialism, and talking about "reconciliation" and "concessions." The "Political Daily" wrote on September 10: "Whether it is China and the United States, as well as the whole world, can only benefit from mutual concessions and understanding, and further aggravating the situation cannot benefit anyone." The "Borba" also wrote on September 17: "It is precisely the dangerous development of events that orders both sides to show the greatest possible goodwill in order to avoid further complications." What exactly does the "reconciliation" and "tolerance" chanted by the Tito clique refer to? The Slovenian "Messenger" answered on August 26, saying: "If the mainland launches an attack, especially if this action means the prelude to the landing of troops, the United States will not tolerate it." The "Political Daily" on September 3 also wrote: "If the Chinese side continues to exert military pressure, no one can say what will happen." According to these statements by the Tito clique's mouthpiece, the Chinese people can only "tolerate" the armed provocations of the United States, and must not resist; otherwise, the American masters will not tolerate it. If the Chinese people dare to "continue to exert military pressure," a catastrophe will befall them. It is worth noting that here, the Tito clique is so loyal to U.S. imperialism that it forgets to disguise itself, and directly uses the tone of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to threaten the Chinese people when speaking. May I ask: How do the commentators of the Tito clique know so clearly whether the United States will "tolerate" it? Did someone in Washington authorize them to make such remarks?

Following the intentions of their masters, the Tito clique's newspapers and periodicals also tried their best to promote so-called "mediation" of the Taiwan issue by the United Nations. The Zagreb "Free Home" newspaper wrote on September 8: "Just as mediation by the United Nations was necessary in the Middle East, mediation in Asia and other places may also be necessary." The Zagreb "News" also wrote on September 19: "In any case, the conflict in the Formosa Strait will also be discussed in the United Nations." As everyone knows, according to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has no right to interfere in matters belonging to the internal affairs of a country. If the United Nations really wants to perform its duties of maintaining world peace and security, it does have something to do, that is, it should severely condemn the United States' aggressive behavior against China, and ask the United States to immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. However, it seems that this United Nations is still far from being able to do this kind of serious thing. Why is the Tito clique now impatiently promoting United Nations mediation? It is obvious that this practice of the Tito clique is only creating public opinion for imperialist interference in China's internal affairs.

In order to help the U.S. reactionary propaganda, the Tito clique also copied many words and phrases from the U.S. State Department to slander the Chinese people. In order to slander the Chinese people's "leap forward" and the great people's commune movement, they even insisted that China's interior has great "difficulties." According to the description of the Tito clique's newspapers, the situation in China is simply extremely bad. The Tito clique even said in the Zagreb "News" on October 15 that mankind has never "experienced such a degree of bureaucratic degradation and dehumanization as the People's Republic of China is now experiencing." The "Borba" also published lengthy reports slandering our people's communes. On October 23, Tito himself came out to attack. He made a speech in Novo Mesto, once again making shameless slanders against socialist countries. When mentioning China, Tito said: "They have some difficulties, and the difficulties are very big, ... they hope to overcome these difficulties, and sometimes they find ways outside their own country." Tito also wantonly slandered the people's communes, which were built on a voluntary basis by more than 99% of farmers in our country, saying that they are "military communes" and "have little in common with the Marxist concept of socialist construction."

Of course, all these slanders can never detract from the Chinese people's great achievements; on the contrary, they only show the world that the Tito clique has degenerated into Dulles's pawn, and degenerated to the point of singing a duet with the American reactionaries. Dulles said: "Under China's 'commune' system, human personality and dignity are to be denied, and he (she) is only regarded as a material unit." The Tito clique said: "In China, millions of people are turned into machines." Dulles said: China is imposing a kind of "backward, large-scale slavery called communes on 650 million Chinese people." The Tito clique said: The Chinese people are suffering from "dehumanizing" rule. Dulles said: "The Chinese Communist rulers realize that what they are doing will surely arouse the hatred of the Chinese people, so they try to divert this hatred from themselves and target foreigners." Tito said that China is encountering great "difficulties" and that in order to "overcome these difficulties," it is necessary to "find ways outside their own country." Look, their remarks are so consistent that it would be easy to interchange their names without any difficulty.

In the minds of imperialists like Dulles, it is called "having personality" and "having dignity" for the Chinese people to obediently accept the rule of imperialism and feudalism; and it is called "slavery" for the liberated Chinese people to work hard to build their own country. The logic of imperialism can only be like this. But why is it that the tone of the Tito clique, which claims to be Marxists and socialists, is exactly the same as that of the imperialists? It turns out that in order to please their masters, lackeys have to follow their masters and work for them. This is why the people of the world hate the running dogs of imperialism as much as they hate the imperialists.

The Tito clique's various remarks on the Taiwan issue are only a small part of the Tito clique's distortion and slander of the Chinese people's just struggle, and serving the imperialist policy of aggression. However, from this small part of the material, it is enough to see the face of this traitorous clique. Paper cannot wrap fire, and disguise cannot hide the original face. Objective facts are more powerful than any sophistry. Under the magnifying glass of facts, modern revisionists cannot but show their true colors.
