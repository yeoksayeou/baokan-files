"Good Intentions" Stained with Blood
Shi Youyi

The recent execution of a handful of Batista murderers by the Cuban provisional government's military tribunal was described by American news agencies as a "horrible" scene. An American senator said it was a "bloody purge," "inhumane," and "violating Christian doctrine." What kind-hearted "humanitarians"!

According to a recent Cuban weekly, the Batista government had murdered 20,000 Cuban people since seizing power in 1952. On January 11th, 160 bodies of murdered political prisoners were discovered sixty miles west of Havana. What a "horrible" "bloody purge" that was! Unfortunately, the American "good people" turned a blind eye and remained silent. Cuban rebel leader Castro rightly asked, "Why didn't they attack when the Batista government was carrying out large-scale executions of the people?" It is still unknown how the American "good people" will answer this question.

However, an ordinary American has answered the question. An open letter published in the "New York Post," exposing the crimes of the United States in supporting the Batista dictatorship's suppression of the Cuban people, stated: "It is outrageous that the State Department sent many Castro rebels who had fled to the United States back to Cuba, where they were executed by Batista's secret police. But the State Department is full of concern and protection for Batista's dictatorial henchmen who are now fleeing to the United States without any immigration permits." Do we still not understand what role the American imperialists played during the years of the Batista dictatorship? These accomplices to murder, unable to even wash the bloodstains from their own hands, shamelessly preach "humanity," precisely revealing the anxious feelings of "birds of a feather flock together."

It truly is that birds of a feather flock together, and "goodness" is categorized!

    沾满血腥气的“善心”
    施幼贻
    古巴临时政府军事法庭最近处决了一小撮巴蒂斯塔杀人犯，美国通讯社说这是“可怖”的情景。一位美国参议员说，这是“血的清洗”，是“不人道”和“违反基督教义的”。好一些善心的“人道主义者”！
    据最近出版的一家古巴周刊报道：巴蒂斯塔政府自1952年攫取政权以来，曾经杀戮了二万古巴人民。本月11日在哈瓦那以西六十英里的地方，发现被杀害的政治犯尸体一百六十具。这是何等“可怖”的“血的清洗”啊！很遗憾，美国的“善人”却视而不见、缄口不言了。古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗问得好：“在巴蒂斯塔政府大规模处死人民的时候，它们为什么不进行攻击呢？”现在还不知道美国的“善人”们怎样来回答这个问题。
    但是，问题却给一个普通的美国人回答出来了。发表在“纽约邮报”上的一封揭露美国支持巴蒂斯塔独裁政权镇压古巴人民的罪行的公开信写道：“令人愤慨的是国务院把流亡到美国的许多卡斯特罗起义分子送回古巴，交给巴蒂斯塔秘密警察处以死刑。但是国务院对现在逃往美国的、没有任何迁移证的巴蒂斯塔独裁者的走狗却百般关怀并给予保护。”美国帝国主义者在巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的年代里，究竟充当的是什么样的脚色，难道我们还不明白么？这些杀人的帮凶，连自己手上的血污都顾不得洗净，就来大言不惭地侈谈“人道”，正好流露了“物伤其类”的焦急心情。
    这真是物以类聚，“善”以类别的啊！
