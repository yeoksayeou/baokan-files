The Science of "Processing According to Law"
Qin Baolin

In the past, traditional Chinese medicine shops often hung a plaque with the eight characters "Authentic medicinal materials, processed according to law." If you wanted to ask them how the medicinal materials were processed, they would definitely tell you that it was done according to "Lei Gong's Processing Methods."

"Lei Gong's Materia Medica Pairings" (said to be written by Lei Gong, a person from the time of the Yellow Emperor) from thousands of years ago has long been lost. Even the four volumes of "Treatise on Processing" written by Lei Xiao during the Northern and Southern Dynasties more than a thousand years ago have been lost (most of it is preserved in Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica"). What most practitioners of Chinese medicine learn is the "Lei Gong's Treatise on Medicinal Properties," compiled by Li Zhongzi of the Ming Dynasty. However, the processing method of Chinese medicine was not invented by Lei Xiao. The ancient "Shen Nong's Materia Medica" already contained records about processing. For example, the "Sang Piao Xiao" entry in the ancient Materia Medica says, "Grows on mulberry branches, pick and steam it." The "steaming" method mentioned here is a type of processing operation.

Why should Chinese medicine be processed? Because the raw herbs collected from the mountains and fields contain very complex ingredients. In order to remove the crude and retain the essence, and preserve the efficacy of the medicine, it is necessary to use artificial methods to overcome the shortcomings of natural raw herbs. Such as removing excess moisture, inhibiting certain toxicities, removing ineffective parts, increasing effective content, making it easy to take, and easy to store, etc. Therefore, processing is a scientific and technical method of Chinese medicine processing, which transforms natural raw herbs into medicines suitable for medical treatment through processing.

The "Compendium of Materia Medica" has detailed records of the preparation of each medicine. Li Shizhen's scientific discussion of drug preparation was unmatched by any pharmaceutical work in the world at that time. For example, the "Hyoscyamus niger" preparation item records "Ten taels of Hyoscyamus niger seeds, one yi of vinegar, boil until dry." According to modern scientific research, the main components of Hyoscyamus niger are alkaloids such as hyoscyamine and atropine. These alkaloids are difficult to dissolve in water, but the "alkaloid salts" generated after treatment with vinegar have higher solubility in water. Therefore, this type of medicine (such as Corydalis, Evodia rutaecarpa, etc.) needs to be processed with vinegar to easily extract the active ingredients, which is in line with scientific principles. Similarly, wine-processing, salt-processing, and honey-processing all have their scientific basis. Other methods, such as steaming and drying, are used to prevent raw herbs from being destroyed by enzymes or bacteria, such as rhubarb and Polygonum multiflorum; air-drying is used to avoid the escape of volatile substances contained in raw herbs, such as Elsholtzia splendens and peppermint; lime or gypsum is applied to prevent raw herbs from being infested by insects, such as cardamom and amomum; bamboo knives are used to scrape and treat them to prevent the tannins in raw herbs from chemically reacting with iron utensils, such as yam, etc. The above-mentioned processing methods all utilize the basic principles of physics and chemistry. In particular, the alchemy of ancient Chinese pharmacists paved the way for modern chemistry. Therefore, the invention of traditional Chinese processing methods and alchemy is a major contribution to the world's pharmaceutical chemistry.

The ancient Chinese medicine processing experience is very rich, and the operation technology has reached as many as seventeen kinds, which can be summarized into four categories. That is, (1) Water processing: washing, soaking, steeping, pickling. (2) Fire processing: stir-frying, baking, simmering, roasting, calcining, exploding. (3) Combined water and fire processing: steaming, boiling, decocting, quenching. (4) No water or fire processing: slicing, sun-drying, grinding, etc.

Processing technology is one of the precious heritages of traditional Chinese medicine, and we should inherit and carry it forward, sort it out and improve it, and strive for excellence, so that our country's medical and health undertakings will be more developed.

    “依法炮制”的科学性
    覃保霖
    过去的中药店，常常挂着“地道药材，依法炮制”八个大字的一块匾。如果你想向他们领教一下，药材是怎样炮制的？他定会告诉你，是遵照“雷公炮炙”的。
    几千年前雷公（相传黄帝时人）所作的“雷公药对”早已失传，就是千多年前南北朝雷斅所著的“炮炙论”四卷也已散佚（大部分被保存在李时珍的“本草纲目”里面）。一般药材从业员所传习的多是明朝李中梓所辑的“雷公炮制药性赋”。但是中药的炮炙法并不是雷斅所发明，古代的“神农本草经”就已经有了关于炮制的记载。如古本草经“桑螵蛸”条下说，“生桑枝上，采蒸之”。这里所说的“蒸”法便是炮制操作的一种。
    为什么中药要经过炮制呢？因为从山野采集回来的生药，所含成分是非常复杂的，为了去粗取精，保存药效，就必须用人工方法来克服天然生药的缺点。如去掉多余的水分、抑制某些毒性、剔除无效部分、提高有效含量、使其便于服用，并易于贮藏等。所以炮制法是一门中药加工的科学技术，使天然生药经过加工炮制而变成适用于医疗的药物。
    “本草纲目”里对每一种药的修治，都有详细的记述。李时珍对药物修治的科学论述是当时世界上任何药学著作所不能企及的。其中如“莨菪”修治项下记有“莨菪子十两，醋一镒，煮干为度”。根据近代科学研究，莨菪的主要成分为莨菪鹼、阿托品等生物鹼，而这些生物鹼是难溶于水的，但加醋处理后生成的“生物鹼盐”在水中却有较高的溶解度。因此，像这一类药（如延胡索、吴茱萸等）需要加醋制后才易于煎出有效成分，这是符合科学原理的。同样，关于酒制、盐制、蜜制等也都有它的科学根据。其他如为避免生药被酵素或细菌所破坏，有蒸、晒等法，如大黄、何首乌一类药；为避免生药所含挥发性物质的散逸，有阴干法，如香薷、薄荷；为防止生药受虫蛀，就涂石灰或石膏，如豆蔻、砂仁；为防止生药中鞣质与铁器起化学变化，就用竹刀刮治，如薯蓣等等。以上这些炮制法都是运用了物理及化学的基本原理。特别是祖国药学家的炼丹术为近代的化学开辟了道路，因此，祖国炮制学及炼丹术的发明是对世界药物化学的重大贡献。
    古传中药炮制经验是非常丰富的，在操作技术上达到了十七种之多，归纳起来又可分为四大类。即（一）水制：洗、浸、泡、渍。（二）火制：炒、焙、煨、炙、煅、煿。（三）水火共制：蒸、熬、煎、淬。（四）不用水火制：镑、曝、研等。
    炮制技术是祖国医药学的宝贵遗产之一，我们应该加以继承和发扬，整理和提高，精益求精，使我国的医药事业更加发展。
