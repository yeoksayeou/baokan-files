Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, January 17th: Mongolia's young civil aviation industry is developing rapidly. Currently, there are regular routes within Mongolia from Choibalsan and Sukhbaatar in the east to Gobi-Altai and Khovd provinces in the west. In addition, the capital Ulaanbaatar has regular international routes to Beijing and Irkutsk in the Soviet Union.

Mongolia's aviation business is also increasing. In 1957, there were more than 4,700 flights throughout the year. The number of flights in 1958 greatly exceeded this figure, with more than 4,500 flights in the first six months alone. Civil aviation personnel ensure flight safety and pay attention to reducing transportation costs and increasing revenue.

The Mongolian Aviation Administration was established in 1956 and began civil aviation operations, mainly delivering mail.

    蒙民航事业迅速发展
    据新华社乌兰巴托17日电　年轻的蒙古民用航空事业迅速地发展着。现在，蒙古国内东到乔巴山、苏赫巴托尔，西至戈壁阿尔泰和科布多省都有定期航线。此外，首都乌兰巴托还和北京、苏联的伊尔库次克有定期的国际航线。
    蒙古的航行业务也随着增加。1957年全年共飞行了四千七百多次，1958年的飞行次数大大超过了这个数字，仅在前六个月就飞行了四千五百多次。民用航空人员保证了航行安全并且注意降低运输成本和增加收入。
    蒙古航空交通管理局在1956年建立的同时，开始了民航业务，当时主要是传递邮件。
