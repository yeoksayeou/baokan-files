    Moderate Diet for a Strong Body
    Jue Ying
    When a family gathers for a meal, or when entertaining guests, people always encourage others to eat more. When the other person says they've had enough and don't want any more, the host still says they are being "polite," and always tries to find a reason to get them to eat a little more. People generally have the idea that when it comes to eating, it's always good to eat a little more, as long as they can eat it.

    But that's not the case.

    Eating is like adding fuel to a machine. The operation of various machines requires fuel to supply heat energy; in order to maintain the normal physiological functions of the body and engage in various types of labor, people also need heat energy. The heat energy of a machine comes from fuel, and all the heat energy needed by the human body comes from food.

    How much heat energy does a person need each day? This is closely related to age, gender, climate, and the intensity of physical labor. Among them, physical labor is the most important factor. Those engaged in light physical labor, such as clerks and handicraft workers, need about 2,600 calories of heat energy per day; those engaged in moderate physical labor, such as drivers and textile workers, need 3,000 calories per day; those engaged in heavy physical labor, such as fitters and blacksmiths, need 3,500 calories of heat energy per day; and those engaged in very heavy physical labor, such as stevedores and lumberjacks, need 4,200 calories per day. Generally speaking, in some occupations, because the intensity of labor does not change much, the heat energy they need is relatively constant. In some occupations, such as farmers, their labor types and intensities vary with the seasons, so the heat energy they need also varies with the labor: more heat energy is needed during busy farming seasons and when the work is heavy; less heat energy is needed during slack farming seasons and when the work is light. On average, they generally need about 2,800 to 3,500 calories of heat energy per day.

    Heat energy comes from food. Among the foods we eat daily, those that provide more heat energy are grains, potatoes, beans, dried meats, oils, and sugars. Usually, about 70%-90% of the total heat energy we need comes from grains. Each pound of grain provides 1,800 calories, and each pound of sweet potatoes provides 560 calories. For example, if a person engaged in moderate physical labor needs 3,000 calories of heat energy per day, and if 90% of the heat energy comes from grains and sweet potatoes, then eating one pound of grains and two pounds of sweet potatoes can meet the need for heat energy; if more non-staple foods are eaten, or if the need for total heat energy is not that great, then there is no need to eat that much grain.

    The heat energy we get from food should be properly adapted to the heat energy needed by our body, so as to maintain normal weight and physical strength. If the supply of heat energy is insufficient for the body's needs, it will gradually make the body thin, reduce resistance, and make physical strength difficult to sustain. Conversely, if you eat too much, it is also harmful to the body, as it will put too much burden on the stomach and intestines, affecting digestion and absorption, and will eventually cause gastrointestinal diseases. At the same time, excessive heat energy will eventually cause obesity, affecting physical strength and labor efficiency. Therefore, we should adjust our food intake appropriately according to the need for heat energy. Eating too little is not good, and eating too much is also harmful.

    饮食适量　身强体壮
    珏莹
    一家人团聚吃饭，或是宴客，人们总会劝别人多吃点饭。当对方说够了，不吃了，主人还要说他“客气”，总要想点名目让别人再吃一点。人们大体上都有个想法：吃饭嘛，能多吃一点总是好的，只要他吃得下。
    其实不然。
    吃饭犹如机器加燃料。各种机器的运转，需要燃料来供给热能；人为了维持身体的正常生理机能，和从事各种不同的劳动，同样也需要热能。机器的热能来自燃料，人体所需要的热能全部是从食物得来的。
    一个人每天需要多少热能呢？这与年龄、性别、气候以及体力劳动的强度有密切的关系。其中体力劳动是最重要的因素，凡从事轻量体力劳动的人，如抄写员、手工艺工人等，每日约需热能二千六百卡；中量体力劳动者如驾驶员、纺织工，每日需要三千卡；重体力劳动者如钳工、铁匠，每日约需热能三千五百卡；极重的体力劳动者如装卸工、伐木工等，每日约需四千二百卡。一般说来，某些职业中由于劳动强度的变化不多，他们所需要的热能就比较恒定。也有些职业，例如农民，他们的劳动种类和强度随着季节而有所不同，因而他们所需的热能也就随着劳动而有变化：农忙和活重时需要的热能较多；农闲而活轻时需要的热能就较少。平均说来，每日大致需要热能二千八百至三千五百卡。
    热能是由食物得来的，在我们日常所吃的食物中，供给热能比较多的是谷类、薯类、豆类、干肉类、油脂和糖等。平常我们所需要的总热能约70％—90％是来自谷类。每一斤谷类供热一千八百卡，每斤甜薯供热五百六十卡，如以一个中等体力劳动者为例，每天需要三千卡热能，如果副食品的进量不多，有90％的热能来自谷类和甜薯的话，那么吃一斤谷类和二斤甜薯，即可满足对热能的需要；如果副食品吃得较多，或总热能的需要不是这样大的话，那就不需要吃这样多的谷类了。
    我们从食物中所得的热能应该和我们身体所需要的热能正相适应，这样就可维持正常的体重和体力。如果热能的供给不足身体的需要，将使身体逐渐消瘦，抵抗力减低，体力不易持久。相反，如果吃得太多，对身体也有害处，会使胃肠的负担太重，影响消化和吸收，久了将造成肠胃病。同时，热能过多，日久会造成身体肥胖，影响体力和劳动效率。因此，我们应该按热能的需要来适当的调节我们的进食量，吃得太少不行，吃得太多也有害处。
