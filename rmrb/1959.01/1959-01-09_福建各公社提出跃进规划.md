According to the Fujian Daily News, the ten proposals made by the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural Units to rural communes have been enthusiastically received by communes throughout Fujian Province. After earnestly discussing the ten proposals, many communes have put forward plans for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and are immediately taking action to create a new high tide in winter production.

After discussing the ten proposals, the communes in the suburbs of Nanping City, located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, were filled with greater confidence in achieving a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year. After discussing the proposals, the Red Flag Commune immediately revised its plans to expand commodity production. Everyone decided to increase the planting area for vegetables and to raise more pigs and sheep.

After discussing the ten proposals, the Party Committee of the Green Treasury Commune, a famous forest area, decided, based on its practical conditions, to vigorously increase grain production while increasing afforestation from 15,000 mu to 28,000 mu.

The Longhua Commune in Xianyou, famous for its large-scale and high-yield sugarcane production, became even more motivated after seeing the newspaper containing the ten proposals. They plan to plant 9,150 mu of sugarcane this year, with an average yield of 70,000 jin per mu, and a total output that is double that of last year. Specific measures include deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, and replanting with new sugarcane seedlings. In the current winter production, the commune members have also immediately strengthened the field management of winter crops in accordance with the requirements put forward in the ten proposals.

More than 20,000 tea farmers in the Shekou Commune of Fuan, the origin of the famous Tan Yang Congou tea, enthusiastically responded to the ten proposals made by the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural Units. They are determined to implement the policy of "less planting, high yield, and more harvest" in grain production, and to greatly develop economic crops such as tea and fruit. This year, they plan to build a new tea farm of 6,000 mu and two fruit farms. The commune has now organized thirteen tea and fruit professional teams, with more than 900 people specifically responsible for tea and fruit production, and has begun to open up new tea gardens.

After discussion, the Xishan Commune in Longyan requested that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all be greatly developed this year, striving for each commune member to have 2,000 jin of grain and a total income three times higher than last year. In order to realize this plan, more than 1,500 laborers in the commune have participated in various professional teams and are vigorously engaging in winter production under the unified leadership of the commune.

The representatives of various counties attending the Fuan Prefectural Committee's meeting on the comprehensive leap forward in fishery production, seeing the ten proposals, were all invigorated and expressed their willingness to continue to exert their efforts and work together to fight for the realization of the fishery production targets of the ten proposals.

Inspired by the ten proposals, the Chaoqian Commune on the coast of Hui'an decided to vigorously develop the salt and fishing industries, planning to build ten more salt farms, increasing salt production from 1 million dan to 1.6 million dan. Fisheries production should develop both fishing and aquaculture simultaneously. The commune will establish three fish fry incubation farms to ensure the production of 7 billion fish fry this year.

    据福建日报消息　全国农业先进单位代表会议向农村公社提出的十大倡议，得到福建省各地公社的热烈响应。许多社在认真讨论十大倡议之后，提出了今年更大更全面的跃进规划，并且立即行动起来，要使冬季生产形成新的高潮。
    地处闽北山区的南平市郊各公社讨论了十大倡议后，对今年更大更全面的跃进更加充满了信心。红旗公社讨论倡议后，立即修订计划，扩大商品生产。大家决定增加蔬菜种植面积，还要多养猪，多养羊。
    著名林区绿色金库公社党委会讨论了十大倡议后，根据切实的条件，决定在大力增产粮食同时，造林从一万五千亩增加到二万八千亩。
    以甘蔗大面积丰产闻名的仙游龙华公社社员看到登载十大倡议的报纸后，干劲更大了。他们计划今年种甘蔗九千一百五十亩，亩产平均七万斤，总产量要比去年增加一倍。具体措施是深翻、增施肥料、换插甘蔗新苗。在当前冬季生产中，社员们也根据十大倡议中提出的要求，立即加强了冬种作物田间管理工作。
    闻名中外的坦洋工夫茶产地——福安社口公社两万多茶农，热烈响应全国农业先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议。粮食生产坚决贯彻少种、高产、多收的方针，茶叶、水果等经济作物要大发展。今年计划新建一个六千亩的茶场，二个水果场。现在全社已组织了十三个茶果专业队，有九百多人专门负责茶果生产，并开始开辟新茶园。
    龙岩溪山公社经过讨论，要求今年农林牧副渔全面大发展，争取每个社员有粮二千斤，总收入比去年增加三倍。为了这个规划的实现，全社一千五百多劳力，已分别参加了各专业队，在公社统一领导下大闹冬季生产。
    正在福安地委参加渔业生产全面大跃进会议的各县代表们，看到十大倡议，个个精神奋发，表示要继续鼓足干劲，共同努力为实现十大倡议的渔业生产指标而奋战。
    惠安沿海的超先公社在十大倡议的鼓舞下，决定大力发展盐渔业，计划再建十个盐场，盐产量从一百万担提高到一百六十万担。渔业生产要捞捕与养殖同时发展，社里建立三个鱼苗孵化场，保证今年生产七十亿条鱼苗。
