Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 6th (TASS dispatch): According to a report in the Argentinian newspaper "La Prensa" on the 6th, one of the leaders of the Cuban rebels who crushed the Batista dictatorship, Freyre, said that the Cuban people's anti-American sentiment is very strong. He said that the bullets given to the Batista dictator by the American government killed hundreds of Cubans. Freyre emphasized that when people see the words "Made in the USA" and "for Western Hemisphere 'defense'" written on unexploded bombs, it is difficult for them to explain to the families of the revolutionary martyrs that the United States is dealing with "world communism."

    古巴起义军一领袖说
    古巴人民反美情绪强烈
    巴蒂斯塔屠杀人民用的是美国武器
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯6日讯：据阿根廷“新闻报”6日报道，粉碎巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的古巴起义军领袖之一弗莱特说，古巴人民的反美情绪十分强烈。他说，美国政府给予巴蒂斯塔独裁者的子弹打死了数以百计的古巴人。弗莱特强调指出，当人们看到没有爆发的炸弹上写着“美国制”和供西半球“防御”之用等字样的时候，他们很难向起义的死难者家属解释，美国是在对付“世界共产主义”。
