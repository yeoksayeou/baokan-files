    This newspaper reports: The Penglai People's Commune in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, has summarized its last spring fertilizer accumulation experience, organized a professional team, and is vigorously engaged in high-temperature composting that produces more fertilizer, faster fertilizer production, better quality, and saves labor.
    When the Penglai Commune recently organized the masses to summarize the experience of last year's spring bumper harvest, it affirmed that increasing the application of high-quality fertilizer was one of the main measures to ensure increased production. Everyone compared the different effects of various fertilizers last year and made their selections. The facts of many brigades have proved that high-temperature compost has high quality and good fertilizer efficiency, and also produces more fertilizer and yields fertilizer faster.
    While accumulating human and animal manure and making soil-based fertilizer, the entire commune has universally promoted high-temperature composting. After the implementation of high-temperature composting, the commune members who were assigned to accumulate fertilizer worked while studying, improving methods and technologies, speeding up fertilizer production, and further improving quality. Last year, most of the high-temperature compost used rice straw as raw material, which wasted rice straw and did not produce much fertilizer; this year, they switched to using thatch, fallen leaves, coal dust, manure grass, sod (shovelled from the edges of fields and ditches), etc. as raw materials, and the fertilizer production rate has greatly increased. Last year, the amount of manure mixed into high-temperature compost was small; this year, animal manure, human urine and feces, and drainage ditch water are generally added in greater quantities to increase the temperature and rotting ability, and the fertilizer production time has also been shortened from ten days to seven days. The May 1st Brigade used the principles of high-temperature composting to install fire dragons under the cattle and horse stables, which not only kept the cattle and horses warm but also made the manure rot faster. Last year, fertilizer production was carried out in the village; this year, they adopted the method of collecting raw materials locally, composting locally, and applying fertilizer locally, making fertilizer next to the fields.

    高温堆肥多快好省
    本报讯  云南省宜良县蓬莱人民公社通过总结去春积肥经验，组织专业队伍，大搞出肥多、造肥快、质量好、省劳力的高温堆肥。
    蓬莱公社最近组织群众总结去年大春丰产经验的时候，肯定了增施优质肥料是保证增产的主要措施之一。大家对比去年各种肥料的不同效果，加以选择。许多大队的事实都证明，高温堆肥质量高、肥效好，而且造肥多、出肥快。
    全社在积人畜肥、造土化肥的同时，普遍推广了高温堆肥。高温堆肥推行后，各队分工积肥的社员边做边研究，改进了方法和技术，加快了造肥速度，进一步提高了质量。去年造高温堆肥，大部分使用稻草做原料，既浪费了稻草，造出的肥料又不多；今年他们改用茅草、腐叶、草煤、粪草、草皮（在田边沟边铲的）等做原料，出肥率大大增加。去年造高温堆肥粪厩肥掺得少，今年普遍多掺畜粪、人粪尿、阴沟水，增加温度和腐熟能力，造肥时间也由十天缩短到七天。五一大队运用造高温堆肥的原理，在牛马厩下装上火龙，既使牛马暖和，又能使厩肥腐熟得快。去年这里造肥是在村里进行的，今年这里采取了就地采原料，就地堆肥，就地施肥的办法，都在田边地旁造肥。
