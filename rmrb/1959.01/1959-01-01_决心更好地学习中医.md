    Determined to Learn Traditional Chinese Medicine Better
    Zhao Shuhui, Director of Internal Medicine, Hankou Railway Hospital
    1958 was a year of great harvest, and for me, it was also a very important year. In this year, I began to study traditional Chinese medicine, changed my views on the medicine of our motherland, and established the confidence to strive to become a doctor who combines Chinese and Western medicine.
    I am a Western doctor who has been engaged in medical work for eighteen years. In the past, I studied British and American medical books and used Western medical methods. For decades, I only believed that Western medicine was scientific and looked down on traditional Chinese medicine, thinking that traditional Chinese medicine's talk of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements was unscientific and metaphysical, and that traditional Chinese medicine did not understand physiology and anatomy, and so on. When the Party called on Western doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, I was still skeptical and participated in the study with a tentative attitude. However, after half a year, my views began to waver. I found that traditional Chinese medicine not only has valuable experience accumulated through thousands of years of practice, but also has some theoretical foundations. It includes prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and physiology, and many aspects of its theory are scientific. To say that traditional Chinese medicine does not understand science only shows that one does not understand traditional Chinese medicine. The Yin-Yang and Five Elements that traditional Chinese medicine talks about use Yin and Yang, two opposing terms, to explain the imbalance in the human body and to explain the causes of diseases in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine considers the overall phenomenon of the human body in diagnosis, "seeking the cause according to the symptoms, and determining the method according to the cause," which is in line with certain principles of dialectics. The viewpoint of the five viscera and six bowels in traditional Chinese medicine is basically consistent with modern physiology. Therefore, it cannot be said that traditional Chinese medicine does not understand physiology and anatomy. After this period of study, I changed my views on the medicine of our motherland.
    In welcoming the arrival of 1959, I am determined to learn traditional Chinese medicine better, humbly ask traditional Chinese medicine doctors for advice, often diagnose and treat together with traditional Chinese medicine doctors, study together, and gradually master the medical techniques of traditional Chinese medicine. At the same time, I want to work with traditional Chinese medicine doctors to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, jointly summarize and improve the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, and write scientific papers so that I can become a doctor who combines Chinese and Western medicine more quickly.

### 决心更好地学习中医

    决心更好地学习中医
    汉口铁路医院内科主任　赵叔惠
    1958年是丰收的一年，对于我来说，也是十分重要的一年。在这一年内，我开始学习了中医，改变了对祖国医学的看法，树立了争取作一个中西医合璧的医生的信心。
    我是一个从事过十八年医疗工作的西医，过去学的是英美的医学书籍，用的也是西洋的医疗方法。几十年来，我只相信西医才是科学的，瞧不起中医，认为中医谈阴阳五行不科学，是玄学，中医不懂生理解剖，等等。当党号召西医学习中医时，心里仍然半信半疑，抱着试试看的态度，参加了学习。可是，半年以后，我的观点就开始动摇了，我发现祖国医学不仅有经过数千年实践的宝贵经验，而且也有一些理论基础，它包括预防、诊断、治疗和生理学等多方面的理论，有很多是科学的。说中医不懂科学，正说明自己对中医不了解。中医谈的阴阳五行，它是用阴阳二个对立的名词来解释人体内不平衡现象，解释疾病产生的原因，以便于诊断、治疗。中医在诊断中考虑到人体的整体现象，“随症求因，随因定法”，这是合乎一定的辩证法的原则的。中医的五腑六脏观点，它与现代生理学基本相符合，因此，也不能说中医不懂生理解剖。经过这一时期的学习，我改变了对祖国医学的看法。
    在迎接1959年来到的时候，我决心更好地学习中医，虚心地向中医请教，经常跟中医一起诊疗，一起学习，逐步掌握中医的医疗技术。同时，要和中医一道，取长补短，共同总结和提高中医学理论，写出科学论文来，使自己更快地成为一个中西医合璧的医生。
