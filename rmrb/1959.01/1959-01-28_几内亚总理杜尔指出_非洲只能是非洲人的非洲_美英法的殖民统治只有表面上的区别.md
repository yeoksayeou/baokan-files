Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 27th: Guinean Prime Minister Sékou Touré, in an interview with a reporter from the West German magazine "Der Spiegel," said, "The only conclusion we have drawn from our colonial past is that Africa will belong to Africans. White people have not been able to penetrate Africa, nor have they been able to change Africa. Their time is over. The original Africa will shine brightly."

The West German magazine "Der Spiegel" published an interview with Touré in its January 28th issue.

Touré said that the "process of disintegration" of French Africa "has already begun, and France will lose all its possessions in Africa in the short or long term—I believe in the short term."

Touré exposed that the "Eurafrica" plan actually meant expanding Europe into Africa. He said that Europeans must abandon this idea, "We live in Africa, not Eurafrica, nor Asiafrica."

Touré stated that Guinea is ready to cooperate with all countries on an equal footing.

When the reporter asked him why Guinea formed a federation with Ghana after declaring independence, he replied that de Gaulle had left him no choice. De Gaulle wanted the republics within the French "Community" to allow him to control all news and communications agencies in Africa that had contact with foreign countries, to control strategic raw materials, and also to control the electricity that could be greatly developed in Guinea. Touré believed that Guinea's relationship with France could be closer than with other European countries.

Touré also talked about the federation between Guinea and Ghana. He said that the basic agreement signed by the two countries stipulated the formulation of a common foreign policy, trade and investment policy, but each country retains its sovereignty and its own system. The next step is to establish a union of states and establish some kind of clear joint institutions including defense, foreign affairs, currency, foreign trade, customs, domestic trade and investment.

Touré denounced colonial rule. He pointed out that the distinctions created by various types of colonial rule—British rule in Ghana and Nigeria, French rule in other countries, and American rule in Liberia—are superficial. He emphasized that Africa will develop its own traditions, and Africans will use their own creative abilities and their own ideas to overcome the contradictions left over from the colonial period.

### 几内亚总理杜尔指出  非洲只能是非洲人的非洲  美英法的殖民统治只有表面上的区别

    几内亚总理杜尔指出
    非洲只能是非洲人的非洲
    美英法的殖民统治只有表面上的区别
    据新华社柏林27日电　几内亚总理杜尔在接见西德“明镜”周刊记者时说，“我们从受到殖民统治的过去所得出的唯一结论就是非洲将属于非洲人。白人没有能渗入非洲，也没有能改变非洲。他们的时代已经完了。原来的非洲将光芒四射”。
    西德“明镜”周刊在1月28日出版的一期中发表了对杜尔的访问记。
    杜尔说，非洲法国属地“瓦解的过程早就开始了，法国将在短期或长期——我相信将在短期内——丧失它在非洲的全部属地”。
    杜尔揭穿“欧非共同体”计划实际上意味着把欧洲扩张到非洲。他说，欧洲人必须抛弃这个念头，“我们居住的地方是非洲，不是欧非洲，也不是亚非洲”。
    杜尔表示，几内亚准备在平等的基础上同所有的国家合作。
    当记者问他为什么几内亚宣布独立以后同加纳结成了联邦，他答复说，是戴高乐弄得他没有选择的余地的。戴高乐要法国“共同体”内的共和国让他控制非洲境内同外国联系的整个新闻和通讯机构，控制战略原料，而且还控制可以在几内亚大大发展的电力。杜尔认为几内亚同法国的关系可以比跟欧洲其他国家的关系更加密切。
    杜尔还谈到几内亚同加纳结成的联邦问题。他说，两国所签订的基本协定规定制订一项共同的外交、贸易和投资政策，但是各国保留它的主权和它自己的体制。下一步是成立国家联盟，建立某种明确的联合机构包括国防、外交、货币、对外贸易、关税、对内贸易和投资等。
    杜尔指责殖民统治。他指出，各种类型的殖民统治——英国在加纳和尼日利亚的统治，法国在其他一些国家的统治，美国在利比里亚的统治——所造成的区别是表面上的。他强调说，非洲将发展它自己的传统，非洲人将用他们自己的创造性的能力和他们自己的思想来克服殖民统治时期所遗留下来的矛盾。
