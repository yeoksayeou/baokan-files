The Duomei People's Commune in Heqing County, Yunnan Province, is refining its economic work. It has established a set of cost accounting and fixed production systems, and the commune's industrial production has made new progress.

Before the establishment of this commune, during the upsurge of the whole people running industry, 3,652 factories of various sizes had been established. These factories played a great role in supporting the agricultural leap forward and meeting the needs of the state and the commune. However, because the factories did not establish the necessary cost accounting and management systems, no one, from top to bottom, had any idea how much product there was, how much output value, how much raw material was used, and how much labor was spent.

In response to these situations, the commune party committee, on the basis of unifying ideological understanding, strengthened and improved the organizational leadership of the factories, carried out comparisons and technical innovations, merged sixty-five factories into seventeen branch factories, and established an accounting system.

Due to the establishment of the accounting system and the strengthening of planned management by adopting the mass line method, the commune's industrial production has greatly developed. By November 1958, the factories had turned in a profit of 8,550 yuan. This has laid a good foundation for vigorously developing industrial production and implementing the industrialization of the commune this year.

    朵美公社经济工作越做越细
    本报讯　云南鹤庆县朵美人民公社的经济工作越做越细，建立了一套成本核算和固定生产制度，公社工业生产有了新发展。
    这个公社成立前，在全民办工业的高潮中，曾经建立三千六百五十二个大小工厂。这些工厂对支援农业跃进，满足国家和社的需要，都起了很大作用。但由于工厂内部没有建立必要的成本核算和管理制度，长期以来究竟产品有多少？产值多大？用了多少原料？花了多少劳动力？从上到下都心中无底。
    公社党委针对这些情况，在统一思想认识的基础上，加强和健全工厂的组织领导，开展评比和技术革新，将六十五个工厂并为十七个分厂，建立了核算制度。
    由于建立核算制度和采用群众路线的方法加强了计划管理，公社的工业生产有了很大发展，到1958年11月份，工厂缴出利润八千五百五十元。为今年大力发展工业生产和实行公社工业化，打下了良好的基础。
