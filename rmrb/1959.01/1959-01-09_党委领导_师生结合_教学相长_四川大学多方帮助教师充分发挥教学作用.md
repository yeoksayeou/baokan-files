    Party Committee Leadership, Teacher-Student Integration, Teaching and Learning Enhance Each Other
    Sichuan University Helps Teachers Fully Play Their Teaching Role
    (Our Chengdu Dispatch) Sichuan University, on the basis of comprehensively implementing the Party's education policy, further helps teachers to improve their political awareness and work enthusiasm, so that they can closely integrate with students and play a greater role in teaching, scientific research and other work.
    In carrying out this work, Sichuan University has improved the organization and leadership of teaching work, properly arranged teachers' working hours, strengthened teachers' political and theoretical study, and organized them to go deep into reality and into the masses, so that teachers' work, study, thinking and life can all receive necessary care and help.
    In terms of improving the organization and leadership of teaching work, Sichuan University has strengthened the Party's leadership and given full play to the role of teachers. Each department has established teaching groups or course groups according to courses or majors. These teaching organizations, under the leadership of the Party committee, combine teachers and students to jointly study teaching, scientific research and other aspects of work. Such teaching organizations promptly understand students' opinions and requirements, strengthen collective research and the view of teachers being fully responsible for students, and therefore have a significant role in reforming teaching and giving play to the role of teachers. Departments such as Chinese and Biology have adopted this "three-way combination" method for compiling teaching syllabuses and textbooks, and reforming teaching methods. In just one month, the teachers and students of the Chinese Department compiled teaching syllabuses for twelve courses, and lecture notes and reference materials for ten courses. During the compilation process, the Party branch of the department organized teachers and students to study Marxist literary theory, educated both teachers and students to cooperate closely, and criticized the ideas of some old teachers who were reluctant to part with the old system and some students who were unwilling to cooperate with old teachers. In teaching, the Party branch also adopted the "three-way combination" method under the leadership of the Party committee to help teachers improve their teaching methods, and teaching work has therefore taken on a new look. Professor Yang Mingzhao, who teaches Chinese literary history, used to have the problem of displaying materials but lacking viewpoints. Now, the lecture notes compiled using the "three-way combination" method, fully understand students' requirements in advance, and are presented to young teachers for trial lectures, and student opinions are collected from the teaching group after class for continuous improvement, which is welcomed by students. Teachers in the teaching groups of various courses in the Mathematics Department also go deep into each class, frequently understand students' learning situation, provide timely tutoring, and absorb students' opinions to improve teaching. In this way, teachers have changed the shortcomings of only being responsible for classroom teaching in the past, and students have learned knowledge more firmly and deeply.
    The school also encourages and helps teachers' scientific research work in many ways. Departments such as Chemistry and Chinese especially advocate teacher-student cooperation under the leadership of the Party committee. Fourth-year teachers in the Chemistry Department were unfamiliar with the newly opened specialized courses in the combination of specialized courses and scientific research, and therefore lacked confidence in carrying out research in this area. The Party branch of the department encouraged teachers, explaining their leading role in completing these tasks, and at the same time, convened teachers and students to study together. The teachers' enthusiasm was greatly increased, and now they have jointly proposed more than seventy research topics with the students. Some old teachers in the Mathematics Department have considerable research in basic mathematical theory. However, they believe that the problems in this area are far from production practice, and therefore have some concerns about continuing to conduct research. The Party branch of the department specifically held a meeting of old teachers, and sent people to talk to them individually, explaining that the shortcomings of teaching being divorced from reality should be improved, but that developing basic theory is still of great significance to the development of the country's scientific undertaking, and affirmed the role of these teachers in this area. After repeated help, these old teachers have formulated scientific research plans related to variational methods, multiple integrals, etc., and have begun to carry out research work.
    In order to ensure that teachers can carry out teaching and scientific research work normally, the departments of Sichuan University have made proper arrangements for teachers' work, production and study time, ensuring that they have sufficient time for lesson preparation, teaching and scientific research work. The teachers of the Mathematics Department also ensure that they have more than two days of scientific research time per week. When participating in production, there are also different considerations based on the teachers' age, physical strength and teaching situation. Old and weak teachers do not participate or only do some light labor. For some newly opened courses, the main lecturers need to prepare from scratch, and can reduce their working hours in order to have enough time to prepare lessons.
    Party organizations at all levels of Sichuan University pay special attention to caring for teachers politically and ideologically, helping them to connect with the masses, and better transform and improve themselves. In addition to leading teachers to carry out regular political theory and current affairs policy studies, and establishing a normal study system, the Party organization also often gives them political current affairs reports, and helps them solve ideological problems through individual talks. The Party organizations of various departments have also formulated a system for teachers to go to the countryside and factories with students every year to participate in labor, so that they can be tempered in production practice and contact with the working masses. In the previous period, the departments of Chinese, History, Economics, etc. organized teachers and students to go to the countryside, participating in labor on the one hand, and conducting on-site teaching and scientific research in the people's communes on the other hand. Many teachers have begun to truly realize the importance of combining education with productive labor, and their political enthusiasm and work enthusiasm have been greatly improved. Now, the work enthusiasm of teachers at Sichuan University has been further brought into play, and the relationship between teachers and students has become closer. (Zhou Zuyou)

    党委领导　师生结合　教学相长
    四川大学多方帮助教师充分发挥教学作用
    本报成都电　四川大学在全面贯彻党的教育方针的基础上，进一步帮助教师提高政治觉悟和工作积极性，使他们和学生密切结合，在教学和科学研究等各项工作中发挥更大的作用。
    在进行这项工作中，四川大学改进教学工作组织领导，妥善安排教师工作时间，加强教师政治理论学习和组织他们深入实际，深入群众，使教师的工作、学习、思想和生活，都得到必要的关怀和帮助。
    在改进教学工作组织领导方面，四川大学加强了党的领导，充分发挥教师作用，各系都分别按课程或专业成立了教学小组或课程小组。这些教学组织在党委领导下教师和学生结合，共同研究教学、科学研究等各方面工作。这样的教学组织，及时了解学生的意见和要求，加强了集体研究和教师对学生全面负责的观点，因而在改革教学、发挥教师作用上都有显著的作用。中文、生物等系，编写教学大纲与教材，改革教学方法，都是采取这种“三结合”方法进行的。仅中文系师生在一个月时间，就编写出十二门课的教学大纲，十门课的讲义和参考资料。编写中，系党总支组织师生学习了马克思主义文艺理论，教育师生双方密切合作，并批判了一些老教师舍不得旧体系、部分学生不愿与老教师合作的思想；在教学中，党总支又采取党委领导下“三结合”的方法，帮助教师改进教学方法，教学工作因而出现了新的面貌。讲中国文学史的教授杨明照，过去有摆材料、缺观点的毛病。现在采用“三结合”方法编写的讲义，事先充分了解学生要求，并对青年教师试讲，课后又从教学小组收集学生意见，不断改进，受到学生欢迎。数学系各课程的教学小组的教师，还分工深入各个班，经常了解学生学习情况，及时进行辅导，并吸收学生意见改进教学，这样，教师改变了过去只管课堂教学的缺点，学生学得的知识也更牢更深入了。
    对于教师的科学研究工作，这个学校也从多方面给以鼓励和帮助。化学、中文等系特别提倡在党委领导下教师和学生进行合作。化学系四年级教师在结合新开专门化课程进行科学研究中，对这些课都很生疏，因而对进行这方面的研究工作缺乏信心，系党总支就鼓励教师，说明他们在完成这些任务中的主导作用，同时召集师生一起研究，教师热情大为高涨，现在已和学生共同提出七十多个研究题目。数学系有些老教师在数学基本理论方面有相当研究。但是，他们认为这方面问题与生产实际相距较远，因而对继续进行研究有些顾虑。系党总支专门召开老教师会，并派人与他们个别交谈，说明教学上脱离实际的缺点应该改进，但是，发展基本理论对国家科学事业发展仍有重要意义，肯定了这些教师在这方面的作用。经过反复帮助，这些老教师已制订出有关变分法、多重积分等方面的科学研究计划，开始进行研究工作。
    为了保证教师们正常地进行教学和科学研究工作，四川大学各系对教师的工作、生产和学习时间都作了妥善的安排，保证他们有充分的时间进行备课、教学以及科学研究工作。数学系教师们还作到每周有两天以上科学研究时间。在参加生产时，根据教师年龄、体力和教学情况也有不同的照顾。年老体弱的教师不参加或只作些轻微劳动。一些新开设的课程，主讲教师需要从新准备，可以减少劳动时间，以便有足够的时间备课。
    四川大学各级党组织特别注意从政治上、思想上关怀教师，帮助他们与群众联系，更好地改造和提高自己。党组织除领导教师们进行经常性的政治理论和时事政策学习，建立正常的学习制度外，还常为他们作政治时事报告，并通过个别交谈，帮助他们解决思想问题。各系党组织还为教师们制订了每年与学生一起下乡下厂参加劳动的制度，使他们在生产实践以及同劳动群众的接触中受到锻炼。前一时期，中文、历史、经济等系就曾分别组织教师与学生一起下乡，一面参加劳动，一面在人民公社进行现场教学和科学研究。许多教师开始真正体会到教育与生产劳动结合的重要性，政治热情与工作积极性都大为提高。现在，四川大学教师的工作积极性已进一步发挥起来，师生关系也更加密切了。　（周祖佑）
