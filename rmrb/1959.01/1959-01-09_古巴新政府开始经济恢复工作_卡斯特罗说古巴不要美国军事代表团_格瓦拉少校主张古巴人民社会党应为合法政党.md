Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th: The Cuban provisional government began yesterday to work on restoring the damaged national economy.

    According to a report in the Cuban "Revolutionary News" yesterday, the restoration of Cuba's main economic crop—sugar—production and sales has been listed as the most important task of the provisional government. A recent meeting of the National Sugar Workers' Union pointed out that if the sugar cane recovery work starts immediately, Cuba's total sugar harvest this year could reach six million tons. It is reported that the government has begun to take measures to carry out sugar cane recovery work. Interim President Urrutia particularly emphasized the urgency of repairing roads, restoring port facilities, and restoring the production of certain sugar mills.
    The news said that life in the capital, Havana, is beginning to return to normal. Mail delivery in the city has resumed, schools will reopen next Monday, and banks have also resumed business. However, according to government regulations, the banks have frozen the checks issued by the Batista government and taken other measures to prevent Batista's remnants from stealing public funds.
    While the Cuban provisional government is working to restore Cuba's economy and social order, the criminals of the Batista dictatorship continue to be punished. It is reported that the Cuban authorities announced yesterday that they had executed fifteen former government army officers in the capitals of Oriente and Las Villas provinces, including Colonel Casillas Lump, former commander of operations in Oriente Province of the former dictatorial government army. They were found guilty of treason and murdering Cuban revolutionaries. In Havana, police authorities arrested 800 people. Cuban Interim Government Presidential Secretary Luis Buch said yesterday that the government is considering establishing special tribunals to try those who have committed atrocities and war crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th: Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Cuban Provisional Government and former Cuban rebel leader Castro said yesterday, "Revolutionary Cuba no longer needs the help of the U.S. military delegation."

    The U.S. military delegation that Castro referred to had previously directed the Cuban dictatorial government's army to fight against the rebel army. It is reported that Castro held a press conference yesterday while traveling to Havana via Cienfuegos. Castro told reporters that the things that U.S. military personnel taught the Cuban army in the past were of no value. He said mockingly, "It was precisely the failure of the United States (military delegation) that guaranteed the victory of the (Cuban) revolution." He also said that the Cuban army "must always serve the country and the people."
    Speaking of the policies of the Cuban provisional government, Castro believes that this should be decided by Interim President Urrutia. But he said that, in his opinion, it is necessary to prevent people from using public utilities to "continue to exploit the public." He said that public utilities authorities "must strictly abide by" the Cuban government's management system. It is reported that Cuba's most important public utilities are under the control of U.S. monopoly capital.
    At the press conference, Castro also expressed sympathy for the Algerian people's struggle against colonialism. He said he hoped that Algeria would soon become a free territory.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th, TASS: According to a report by "World Telegram and Sun" reporter Talley from Havana, Major Guevara, a close comrade-in-arms of Castro, commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Cuban provisional government, said in response to a question about what attitude the new government will take towards the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party), which had been banned by the Batista dictatorship: "I don't think Cubans will forget that when the U.S. government supplied Batista with weapons, many communists fought Batista one after another. I think the Communist Party has the right to be recognized as one of the legal political parties in Cuba."
    The Cuban People's Socialist Party was in an illegal position during the Batista dictatorship. It has been carrying out the struggle against the dictatorship and for national independence, and supported the Cuban rebel army's armed struggle to overthrow the dictatorial regime.

    新华社8日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府已经从昨天开始从事遭到破坏的国民经济恢复工作。
    据古巴“革命报”昨天报道，恢复古巴主要经济作物——食糖的生产和销售已经被列为临时政府当前最重要的一项任务。全国糖业工人联合会最近举行的会议指出，如果蔗糖的恢复工作立即开始的话，今年古巴糖的收成总数可达六百万吨。据报道，政府已经着手采取措施来进行蔗糖的恢复工作。临时总统乌鲁蒂亚特别强调修路、修复港口设施和恢复某些糖厂的生产的迫切性。
    消息说，首都哈瓦那的生活开始恢复正常。市内的邮件投递工作已经恢复，学校将在下星期一复课，同时银行也恢复了营业。但是，根据政府的规定，银行冻结了巴蒂斯塔政府签发的支票，并且采取了其他防止巴蒂斯塔残余分子窃取公款的措施。
    在古巴临时政府着手恢复古巴的经济和社会秩序的同时，巴蒂斯塔独裁政府的罪犯继续受到惩办。据报道，古巴当局昨天宣布，在奥连特省和拉斯维利亚斯省首府又处决了十五名前政府军的军官，其中包括前独裁政府军奥连特省作战司令卡西利亚斯·伦普上校。他们犯有叛国罪和杀害古巴革命者的罪行。在哈瓦那，警察当局逮捕了八百人。古巴临时政府总统秘书路易斯·布奇昨天说，政府正考虑成立特别法庭，来审讯那些犯有暴行和战争罪行的人。
    新华社8日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府武装部队总司令、前古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗昨天说，“革命的古巴不再需要美国军事代表团的帮助。”
    卡斯特罗所指的美国军事代表团，过去曾指挥古巴独裁政府的军队对起义军作战。据报道，卡斯特罗昨天在前往哈瓦那途经西恩菲哥斯时举行了记者招待会。卡斯特罗对记者们说，美国军事人员过去教给古巴军队的东西没有任何价值。他带着嘲笑的口吻说，“正是美国（军事代表团）的不行，才保证了（古巴）革命的胜利。”他还说，古巴军队“必须始终为国家和人民服务”。
    谈到古巴临时政府的政策时，卡斯特罗认为这要由临时总统乌鲁蒂亚去决定。但是他说，根据他的观点，必须防止人们以公用事业来“继续剥削公众”。他说，公用事业当局“必须严格遵守”古巴政府的管理制度。据报道，古巴最重要的公用事业都在美国垄断资本的控制之下。
    卡斯特罗在记者招待会上还对阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义的斗争表示同情。他说，希望阿尔及利亚不久即将成为自由的领土。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：据“世界电讯与太阳报”记者塔利自哈瓦那报道，古巴临时政府武装部队总司令卡斯特罗的亲近战友格瓦拉少校在回答新政府对曾被巴蒂斯塔独裁政府取缔的古巴人民社会党（共产党）将采取什么态度的问题时说：“我认为古巴人将不会忘记，当美国政府供给巴蒂斯塔武器时，很多共产党员前仆后继地同巴蒂斯塔作战。我认为，共产党有权被人承认它是古巴的合法政党之一。”
    古巴人民社会党在巴蒂斯塔独裁统治时期处于非法地位，它一直进行反对独裁统治和争取民族独立的斗争，并且支持古巴起义军的推翻独裁政权的武装斗争。
