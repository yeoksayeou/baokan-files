　　Glad to Hear the Sound of New Year's Firecrackers
　　Deng Chumin
　　New Year firecrackers, strings and strings are set off,
　　The noise of firecrackers, wave after wave.
　　It awakens everything new,
　　It scares away everything old.
　　Set off, set off, set off, set off boldly,
　　Set off until the completion of socialism is accelerated;
　　Make noise, make noise, make noise, make noise loudly,
　　Make noise until we step onto the bright road of communism.
　　At that time, we will continue to set off firecrackers,
　　At that time, we will continue to make noise.
　　At that time, there will be new things to appear,
　　There will be old things to scare away.
　　Continuous revolution, continuous transformation and creation.
　　If God truly created heaven and earth,
　　It would never be finished.
　　From small dust to large planets,
　　They are all plastics waiting to be rebuilt and expanded.
　　People want to conquer society, conquer nature,
　　And transform themselves,
　　Only through eternal and ceaseless struggle and creation.
　　The all-round Great Leap Forward of 1958,
　　Has victoriously passed;
　　More brilliant victories,
　　A greater and more comprehensive leap forward,
　　Look to today and tomorrow.
　　Another New Year has arrived,
　　Songs and laughter everywhere,
　　Fight! Leap forward! Sing!
　　Sing of the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    喜闻新年鞭炮声
    邓初民新年鞭炮，一串串地放，鞭炮闹声，一阵阵地闹。它把一切新的东西唤醒，它把一切旧的东西吓跑。放，放，放，大胆的放，放到社会主义加速完成；闹，闹，闹，高声的闹，闹到跨上共产主义光明大道。那时节，还要继续的放，还要继续的闹。那时节，还有新的东西要出现，还有旧的东西要吓跑。不断革命，不断改造、创造。假若真是上帝造天地，它永没有造完的时候。小至微尘，大至星球，都不过是些正待改建、扩建的塑料。人们要征服社会，征服自然，改造自己，也只有永恒不息的战斗和创造。1958年的全面大跃进，胜利的过去了；更辉煌的胜利，更大、更全面的跃进，还看今朝、明朝。又是一个新年来到，到处歌声到处笑，战斗吧！跃进吧！歌唱吧！歌唱党和毛主席领导好。
