    A Triumphant Song of War Against Nature
    ——Changes in Minority Areas Seen from Several Fragments
    By Our Correspondents Cheng Jingming and Zhao Qi
    Our motherland is at war with nature, and in places far from the capital, in those minority areas, our minority brothers are also fighting against nature. They appear so resolute, heroic, and full of great creative power, and they are advancing with the steps of giants!
    Knights Forged into Farmers
    The robust Kazakhs, dressed in leather pants and high leather boots, live in the Altai Mountains on the border. Who would have thought that these Kazakh herdsmen, who have lived a nomadic life for generations, some of whom had never even eaten grain before liberation, are now skilled in agricultural production? The combined operation of animal husbandry and agriculture is precisely the most profound change in the Altai.
    How many difficulties must be overcome to transform from a herdsman into an excellent farmer! Bilar of the October People's Commune in Jimunai County talked with great interest about his initial experience in learning to farm. It was April 1954 when the People's Government sent Han technicians, seeds, and animal-drawn farm implements to help the people of Nuoyabao plant wheat. The government's cordial concern made the herdsmen determined to learn farming. At first, it was really not easy. These brave and fierce knights, who had lived on horseback for decades, were good at grazing and raising livestock, and at braving the bitter cold and snow to hunt wild bears and catch evil wolves. Now, however, they were tending crops in the fields all day long. This unfamiliar labor, completely different from nomadic life, made them feel very restrained. However, they slowly got used to it, learned various agricultural techniques, and developed a deep affection for crops just as they did for livestock. Watching the seeds they had sown bear abundant fruit, they were overjoyed and used the wheat they had grown for the first time to make fried cakes and noodles, inviting relatives and neighbors to taste the new harvest. In 1958, the number of livestock in Nuoyabao increased by a net 41.48% in one year, and the cultivated land averaged more than nine mu per person. After the autumn harvest, they built seven large warehouses and sold tens of thousands of catties of surplus grain and more than two thousand kilograms of wool and camel hair to the state.
    In the Altai, a strong ox could only be exchanged for twenty or thirty catties of grain in the past. Herdsmen ate sour milk, milk curds, and beef and mutton all year round. With great difficulty, they could exchange for some wheat, which could only be fried and eaten one grain at a time in milk. Now, they have learned to farm themselves, and they have more than 10,000 tons of surplus grain to support the construction of Karamay. They have learned to make dumplings and wontons from the Han people, learned to make naan bread from the Uygur farmers, and learned to make bread from the Tatars. They can also stir-fry vegetables and cook rice.
    Desert Transformed into Jiangnan
    Establishing a brand-new and happy working life has been the long-cherished wish of all ethnic minorities, and only in the united, cooperative, and loving big family of the motherland has this wish become a reality. Aomendailai of the Tieniu People's Commune in Kezuohou Banner, Inner Mongolia, vividly introduced to us the struggle of the Mongolian people to conquer the desert.
    Aomendailai is an old model worker who has fought hard in the desert for many years. Their Sanjiazi Village is located on a saline-alkali land embraced by the desert. In the spring of 1946, the second year after liberation, they had just planted sorghum when it was blown away by strong winds along with fertilizer and soil before it could germinate. So they replanted millet, and they finally waited for the seedlings to emerge. But then the wind and sand blew so hard that the sky turned dark, and the millet seedlings were buried again. The houses were also collapsing. What difficult days! The old women were crying and clamoring to move. However, difficulties could not frustrate the heroic and indomitable will. Aomendailai and the others said: "The wind is strong, the sand is strong, but no one's ambition is stronger. We have two hands, and we must conquer the desert!" They built new houses and planted buckwheat for the third time. That year, they only harvested four dou of grain per hectare (fifteen mu), but they were not discouraged. According to the instructions of the Party, the people of Sanjiazi Village afforested and closed the mountains for forest cultivation in a planned way, practiced agroforestry intercropping, and dug a river in front of the village. After twelve years of hard work, the village is now surrounded by forests in front and behind, and around the cultivated land. Fourteen forest belts are interwoven into a green network, and the trees are an average of ten meters high. Since then, Sanjiazi Village has become Jiangnan in the desert, with the river flowing gurglingly in front of the door, and lush green trees surrounding the village. In 1958, each person harvested an average of more than 2,000 catties of grain. The village raises chickens and bees, and cattle and sheep are in groups. The children have already eaten all kinds of fruits just picked from the trees.
    Hard-working people have built a beautiful hometown in the desert.
    Scent of Rice Flowers on the Kawa Mountains
    There are deserts in the north and high mountains in the south. Whether in the south or the north, all ethnic minorities have had a common experience: the Party helped them to be thoroughly liberated from class oppression and natural oppression, so that in just a few years, they leapt from feudalism, slavery, and even primitive commune system to socialism, saying goodbye to backwardness forever.
    The Kawa Mountain area of ​​Yunnan is a place with green mountains and valleys and a mild climate, where more than 200,000 hardworking and simple Kawa people live. For centuries, they used bamboo and wooden hoes to plow the land, practicing slash-and-burn cultivation, and only harvested two or three months of grain a year, so they had to fill their stomachs with wild fruits, wild vegetables, and banana roots. They used wooden bowls to eat and bamboo tubes to fetch water. Until a few years ago, some places here still retained the primitive system of common farming.
    Here, not to mention how the Kawa people automatically pulled out the "human head stakes" (cutting off people's heads to sacrifice to the grain is a Kawa custom) while building the first hydropower station in Kawa Mountain; nor can it be fully written about the profound changes in the first batch of iron smelters in this mountainous area that has not yet had an independent handicraft industry; not to mention, what a great leap it is that various new types of iron farm implements have replaced wooden hoes and bamboo pieces. In a place where class differentiation has only recently occurred, the realization of the people's commune is not a miracle of our time?
    Here, I will only tell a story about planting rice that happened in Cangyuan County. In the past, the Kawa people in this place had to divine before sowing seeds. If they found manure in that field, they would not want any of the crops in that area. The work team came to Lameng area, bringing the production experience and new tools of the Han people in the interior, and sending batches of Kawa children to study in the interior. Double-cropping rice can be planted here, but the traditional saying is that eating double-cropping rice will kill the whole family. It is not easy to break thousands of years of superstitious customs. Tian Yanbao, deputy director of the Tuanjie People's Commune in Cangyuan County, excitedly told us about his experience in trying to grow double-cropping rice. In 1956, when the mutual aid group was just established in the village, Tian Yanbao returned from studying in the interior. He was determined to take the lead in trying to grow double-cropping rice, but was first opposed by his mother, younger brother, and wife. He then used countless facts after liberation to persuade them: "We must listen to the Party. Everything the Party teaches us to do is happiness, and doing it will never be wrong!" Tian Yanbao planted an experimental field of early rice in front of the village, and from sowing to rice ripening, people often ran over to check with suspicion. The early rice had a bumper harvest, and Tian Yanbao repeatedly persuaded his family to eat the new grain. He said: "As long as we dare to eat it, others will dare to plant it next year." The following year, the agricultural cooperative was established, and Tian Yanbao was the director of the cooperative. He mobilized several other families to plant 20 mu of double-cropping rice together. In 1958, their double-cropping rice achieved a leap forward, and they began large-scale sowing. Every family had a toilet and the pigs had pens. They vigorously used human manure to strengthen the seedlings. The average yield of the first crop was 1,100 catties per mu, and the second crop was 650 catties, with an average of more than 1,500 catties of grain per person.
    Building a Paradise in the Land of Tigers and Leopards
    The people of ethnic minorities not only learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced in this way, eagerly accepting all new things, but also carry forward the good traditions of bravery, perseverance, and wisdom, daring to fight against natural disasters and become the true masters of nature.
    You may have already known the nationally famous "Tongdao Tiger." This kind of tiger with its long body, great strength, and ferocity is found in Tongdao Dong Autonomous County, Hunan Province. Tongdao is a mountainous area where the three provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou meet. The overlapping peaks and ridges are covered with virgin forests, with towering pines and firs, and cogongrass growing taller than people in the deep mountains. Here, people used to turn pale at the mention of tigers. When the sun set over the mountains or when it was drizzling, there would be bursts of tiger roars. People did not dare to go to the woods to cut timber and dig for medicinal herbs. People were afraid to go down to the fields for production when there were few people. They did not dare to go far away on rainy days. Sometimes, tigers even rushed into the towns and stole cattle and pigs. People were picking bayberries in the trees, and tigers could also jump up and grab them down. For many years, tigers have been the biggest scourge in the lives and production of all ethnic groups, and the scattered individual farmers were powerless in the face of fierce beasts and could only passively defend themselves. When a tiger came, they would beat gongs, drums, light fires, and set off firecrackers, just to scare the tiger away. In 1953 and 1954 alone, tigers ate more than 100 people.
    The Party and the People's Government do not allow wild animals to run rampant, and vigorously launched a mass tiger-fighting campaign to give people a peaceful environment to work and live in. The command for eliminating animal pests, headed by the secretary of the county party committee, was established, and beast-fighting teams were established in every village. The old hunters showed their great skills, setting up crossbows and poisoned arrows in the grass paths, setting up cages beside the villages, driving the mountains to hunt, sitting in the mountains to fight tigers, dividing areas for contracting, and every village was connected by telephone to forecast tiger information at any time. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups thus changed from defense to organized offense in the face of fierce beasts for the first time. In the past few years, 293 tigers and leopards have been captured, and more than 56,000 wild boars, wild sheep, and other wild animals that seriously endanger livestock and crops have been hunted. In 1958, no one in the county was harmed by tigers and leopards, and unprecedented bumper harvests were achieved in production. Now, people can go up the mountains to dig for medicinal herbs and find mineral deposits at any time, and cattle are grazing on the green grass slopes.
    In the Altai grasslands of Xinjiang, in the vast deserts, in the mountainous areas of Hunan, in the border areas of Yunnan, and in many places where ethnic minority brothers live, a new national spirit of vigor and upwardness is also exuded. An even better and more glorious future has already been unfolded before us!

    向大自然开战的凯歌
    ——从几个片断看少数民族地区的变化
    本报记者　程竞明　赵奇
    我们祖国正在向大自然开战，在远离首都的地方，在那些少数民族地区，少数民族兄弟也在向大自然作战。他们显得那样刚毅、豪迈和具有伟大的创造力量，他们是在迈着巨人的步伐前进！
    骑士炼成庄稼汉
    体格魁梧、穿着皮裤和大皮靴的哈萨克人，是住在国境线上的阿尔泰山区的。有谁能够想到，这些世世代代过着游牧生活的哈萨克牧民，有的甚至在解放前从来没有吃过粮食，而现在却成了农业生产的能手。畜牧业和农业结合经营，这正是阿尔泰的最深刻的变化。
    从牧民锻炼成出色的庄稼汉，这中间要战胜多少困难啊！吉木乃县十月人民公社的比拉尔，饶有兴味地谈起自己当初学种田的情形。那是1954年的4月，人民政府派来了汉族技术员，又送给种籽和马拉农具，帮助诺牙堡的人种小麦。政府的亲切关怀，使牧民们下决心学会做农活。一开始可真不容易，这些在马背上生活了几十年的骁勇慓悍的骑士，他们所擅长的，是怎样放牧和饲养牲畜，怎样冒着严寒风雪打野熊、捕恶狼，而现在，却整天在地里守着庄稼。这种和游牧生活完全两样的陌生的劳动，使他们感到十分拘束。可是，他们还是慢慢习惯了，学会了各种农业技术，对庄稼也像对牲畜一样地发生了深厚感情。眼看着自己播下的种籽，结出丰硕的果实，他们兴高彩烈，用自己第一次种的小麦磨粉做了油饼、面条，邀请亲友邻居来尝新。1958年，诺牙堡的牲畜在一年之内净增41.48％，田地也平均每人九亩多。秋收后，盖起七间大仓库，还卖给国家几万斤余粮和两千多公斤羊毛、驼毛等。
    在阿尔泰，从前一头壮牛只能换二、三十斤粮食，牧民们成年累月吃的是酸奶子、奶干和牛羊肉，好容易换来点麦子，也只能炒熟了一粒一粒泡在奶子里吃。现在，他们自己学会了种田，已有上万吨的余粮支援克拉玛依建设。他们向汉族学会了做饺子、馄饨，向维吾尔族农民学会做馕，向塔塔尔人学会做面包，他们还会炒菜做米饭。
    沙漠变江南
    建立崭新的快乐的劳动生活，是各少数民族多年的心愿，只有在团结、合作、友爱的祖国大家庭里，这个愿望才变成了现实。内蒙古科左后旗铁牛人民公社的敖门代来，向我们生动地介绍了蒙古族人民征服沙漠的斗争生活。
    敖门代来就是沙漠上苦战经年的一位老模范。他们三家子村座落在沙漠怀抱的一块盐碱地上。在解放后的第二年—1946年春天，他们刚种下高粱，没到发芽就被狂风连肥料带土壤一起刮走，于是补种谷子，好容易盼得苗儿刚露头，哪知风沙又刮得天昏地暗，谷苗又被埋掉了，房屋也是倒的倒，塌的塌。多艰难的日月啊，老婆婆们在啼哭，闹着要搬家。可是，困难挫折不了英雄们坚韧不拔的意志，敖门代来他们说：“风大、沙大，没有人的志气大，我们有两只手，一定要战胜沙漠！”他们盖起新房子，第三次抢种了荞麦。这一年每公顷
  （十五亩）只收到四斗粮食，他们也不灰心。三家子村的人根据党的指示，有计划地造林和封山育林，实行农林间作，又在村前挖出一条河流。经过十二年的苦战，现在村前、村后和耕地周围都是树林，十四条林带交织成绿色的网，树林面积已达一万九千多亩，树高平均十公尺。从此，三家子村变成了沙漠中的江南，门前河水潺潺流，碧绿的林木绕村庄。1958年每人平均收获粮食二千多斤，村里养鸡养蜂，牛羊成群。孩子们已经吃到刚从树上摘来的各种水果了。
    辛勤劳动的人们，就是这样在沙漠中建设起美丽的家乡。
    佧佤山上稻花香
    北方有沙漠，南方有高山，不论是在南方、北方，各少数民族都有着一段共同的经历，就是党帮助他们迅速地从阶级压迫和自然压迫下彻底解放出来，使他们在短短的几年内，从封建制度、奴隶制度甚至原始公社制度飞跃到社会主义，和落后永远告别。
    云南佧佤山区是个青山翠谷、气候温和的地方，聚居着二十多万勤劳、淳朴的佧佤人。多少世纪以来，他们用竹片、木锄刨地，实行刀耕火种，一年只收到两三个月的粮食，只好用野果、野菜和芭蕉根充饥。他们吃饭用木碗，打水用竹筒。直到几年前，这里有的地方还残存着原始的共耕制度。
    这里，且不说佧佤族人民怎样一边自动拔掉“人头桩”（砍人头祭谷是佧佤人的习俗），一边建起佧佤山第一座水电站的故事；也写不尽这个还没有独立的手工业的山区，怎样突然出现了第一批炼铁工人的深刻变化；更不用说，各种新式的铁质农具代替了木锄、竹片，该是个多么大的飞跃。在这样一个阶级分化还发生不久的地方，现在实现了人民公社化，难道不是我们时代中的一大奇迹吗？
    这里只讲讲发生在沧源县的一个种水稻的故事。过去，这地方的佧佤人在撒种前要打卦。他们发现那块田里有大粪，那一片庄稼都不要了。工作队来到拉勐地区，带来内地汉族的生产经验和新工具，又送了一批批佧佤人的子弟到内地学习。这里可以种双季稻，但是传统的说法是双季稻吃了全家要死掉。破除千百年来的迷信习俗，并不是轻而易举的事。沧源县团结人民公社的副主任田岩保激动地向我们谈到他试种双季稻的经过。1956年寨子里刚成立互助组，田岩保从内地学习回来了，他决心带头试种双季稻，但首先遭到了母亲、弟弟和妻子的反对。他便用解放后的无数事实来进行说服：“我们要听党的话，凡是党教做的事，就是幸福，做了决不会错！”田岩保在寨前种了一块早稻试验田，从播种到稻谷成熟，经常有人惊疑地跑来察看。早稻丰收了，田岩保又再三说服家里的人吃新谷，他说：“只要我们敢吃，明年别人就敢种了；”第二年成立农业社，田岩保是社主任，他又动员几户人家一起种了二十亩双季稻。1958年他们的双季稻就来了个跃进，开始大面积播种，家家人有厕所猪有圈，大搞人粪壮秧，第一季每亩平均产一千一百斤，第二季六百五十斤，平均每人有粮一千五百多斤。
    虎豹之乡建乐园
    少数民族人民不仅仅这样学先进、赶先进，如饥如渴地去接受一切新鲜事物，而且，更发扬了勇敢、坚毅、而富有智慧的优良传统，敢于向自然灾害作斗争，成为大自然的真正主人。
    你也许早就知道闻名全国的“通道虎”吧，这种身长、力大、性猛的老虎，就出在湖南省通道侗族自治县。通道是湘、桂、黔三省交界的山区，那重重峰岭遍布原始森林，松杉参天，深山茅草长得比人还高。在这里，人们过去真是谈虎色变。当太阳落下山岭，或是飘着毛毛雨的时候，便传来阵阵的虎啸声。人们不敢到树林里伐木挖药材，人少了不敢下田坝生产，下雨天不敢出远门。有时，老虎竟冲进城关镇摽走牛和猪。人在树上摘杨梅，老虎也可以纵上去把人攫下来。多少年来，老虎一直是各族人民生活和生产中的最大祸害，而分散生产的个体农民，在猛兽面前无能为力，只能消极防御。虎来了，就敲锣、擂鼓、燃火、放火炮，只求把虎惊走。仅仅在1953年和1954年，老虎就吃掉一百多人。
    党和人民政府不容许野兽猖狂，大张旗鼓地展开了群众性的打虎运动，争取人们有一个安宁的环境劳动和生活。以中共县委书记为首的消灭兽害指挥部成立起来了，寨寨建立了打兽队。老猎手们都大显神通，草径里张起弩弓药箭，寨旁设下了套笼，打围赶山，坐山打虎，分区包干，各个村寨都通电话，随时预报虎情。各民族人民在党的领导下就这样第一次在猛兽面前从防御转为有组织地进攻。几年来，捕获虎豹二百九十三只，猎得严重危害牲畜、庄稼的野猪、野羊和其他野兽五万六千多个。1958年，全县已没有一个人被虎豹伤害，生产上取得了空前的大丰收。现在，人们随时可以上山挖药材、找矿藏，在那绿色的草坡上，牧放着牛群。
    在新疆阿尔泰草原、在浩瀚的沙漠、在湖南山区、在云南边疆、在许多少数民族兄弟聚居的地方，都同样焕发出一种蓬勃向上的新的民族精神。更美好更光辉灿烂的前程，已经展现在面前！
