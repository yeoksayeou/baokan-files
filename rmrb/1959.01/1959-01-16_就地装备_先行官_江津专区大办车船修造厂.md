Equipping the “Pioneer” Locally
Jiangjin Special District Vigorously Establishes Vehicle and Boat Repair and Manufacturing Plants

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, January 15th) Jiangjin Special District in Sichuan Province is vigorously developing the transportation vehicle manufacturing industry, which has promoted the rapid development of the district's transportation industry. In the short span of the last few months, the transportation departments of the eight counties in this special district have established and expanded an auto repair shop, several auto maintenance and repair teams, fifteen ship repair and manufacturing factories, and more than twenty folk transportation vehicle manufacturing plants. Mechanical and woodworking plants throughout the countryside are also producing large quantities of wheels and accessories.

The equipment in these factories is relatively simple, and most factories started from scratch. At the beginning, there was a lack of skilled workers and machinery, so the transportation department selected a group of activists from among the porters, transportation workers, and road maintenance workers, and also recruited some employees' family members as production workers. Many people learned by doing and taught each other, quickly learning how to repair and manufacture vehicles and boats. Many small factories built their own furnaces, smelted iron, and made their own accessories and iron nails. The Jiangjin County Ship Repair and Manufacturing Plant, the steamboat repair workshop, and the trailer and chicken cart production factories had only a few hammers, pliers, and files as production equipment. The factory buildings of ordinary factories are just a few thatched sheds and civilian houses. Bishan County, which used to be just a small factory that made iron horseshoes and mule shoes, has recently produced fourteen rack carts and trailers.

The rapid development of the transportation vehicle manufacturing industry in the entire district has played a significant role in changing the face of transportation. Factories in various counties are now able to produce various types of trailers that can be attached to cars, horse carts, and bullock carts, improved rack carts, ball bearings, sand-cast iron wheels, improved chicken carts, and many other products. Wooden boat factories can produce wooden boats, steamboat hulls, and ship accessories. Major and intermediate repairs of freight trucks can basically be undertaken by repair shops within the district. Last year, they also used old materials to assemble two vehicles to participate in transportation. Last year, factories throughout the district rushed to produce more than 150,000 various vehicles and more than 5,800 tons of wooden boats, which greatly increased transportation capacity and reduced the phenomenon of manual carrying. Many transportation vehicle factories have become centers for technological innovation for the transportation department. Many ship repair and manufacturing plants have produced chutes, wooden rails, rack carts, earthen trains, and cableway equipment for dock workers, promoting the semi-mechanization and vehicularization of fourteen of the seventeen larger docks in the district. The Tongliang and Hechuan counties' ship repair and manufacturing plants manufactured sixty-four beach winches for boatmen. After the boatmen used the beach winches, their labor intensity was greatly reduced, and the time spent crossing shoals was saved. The Yongchuan County Transportation Vehicle Manufacturing Plant improved two hundred rack carts, making it easier for cart pullers and increasing the amount of transportation. At the special district level, key factories such as new ship repair and manufacturing plants and wire rope factories will be built, and existing auto repair shops and transportation vehicle manufacturing plants and cement plants will be expanded. Each county will also vigorously establish folk transportation vehicle manufacturing plants in accordance with the principle of "small local groups."

    就地装备“先行官”
    江津专区大办车船修造厂
    本报重庆15日电　四川省江津专区大力发展交通工具制造工业，推动了全区交通运输事业的迅速发展。在最近短短几个月里，这个专区八个县的交通运输部门已经建立和扩建了一个汽车修配厂，几个汽车养护修理小组，十五个船舶修造工厂，二十多个民间交通工具制造厂。遍布农村的机械厂和木工厂也在大量生产车轮和配件。
    这些工厂的设备都比较简单，多数工厂是白手兴家的。开办时，缺乏技术工人和机器设备，交通运输部门就在搬运、运输和养路工人中选拔一批积极分子，并且吸收部分职工家属当生产工人。许多人边做边学，互教互学，很快学会了修造车、船。许多小厂都是自建红炉，自炼铁，自打配件和铁钉。江津县的船舶修造厂、轮船修理车间、拖斗和鸡公车生产工厂等，生产设备只是几把铁锤、铁钳和锉刀。一般工厂的厂房就是几间草棚和民房。璧山县过去只打铁质牛掌和马掌的一个小厂，最近也生产了十四部架架车和拖斗。
    全区交通工具制造工业的迅速发展，在改变交通运输面貌方面起了很大作用。各县的工厂已能生产挂在汽车、马车和牛车上的各类拖斗，改良架架车，滚珠，翻砂铁轮子，改良鸡公车等许多产品。木船厂能生产木船、轮船壳架以及船舶的附属工具。运货汽车的大修和中修，基本上也可以由区内修理厂担负。他们在去年还利用旧材料，装配了两部汽车参加运输。去年全区各工厂赶制的各种车辆达十五万多部，木船五千八百多吨，大大增加了运输力，减少了人力挑背现象。许多交通工具工厂已成为交通运输部门革新技术的中心场所。许多船舶修造厂为码头工人生产了梭槽、木轨道、架架车、土火车和索道用具，促进全区十七个较大的码头有十四个实现了半机械化和运输车子化。铜梁和合川两县船舶修造厂为船工们制造了六十四台绞滩机。船工们使用绞滩机以后，大大减轻了劳动强度，节省了过滩时间。永川县交通工具制造厂改良了二百部架架车，使拉车工人省力气，又增加了运输量。专区一级将新建船舶修造厂、钢丝绳厂等骨干工厂，扩建现有汽车修配厂和交通工具制造厂、水泥厂。各县也将根据“小土群”方针大办民间运输工具制造厂。
