Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The national rolling mill conference recently convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided to launch a mass movement to increase steel production throughout the country starting now. It called on rolling mill workers across the country to go all out, do everything possible to increase steel production, and ensure the completion and over-completion of the 1959 steel production plan, to meet the growing needs of industry, agriculture, transportation, and other national economic sectors for the quantity and variety of steel. The task of national steel production in 1959 is: output will more than double that of 1958, and the variety will increase by nearly 2,000 types.

This national rolling mill conference was convened in a timely manner according to the needs of the current national steel production situation. The basic situation of the current national steel production is: "Big in the middle, small at both ends," that is, the smelting capacity is relatively large; the production capacity of raw materials, including ore, coke, refractory materials, and rolling capacity, is relatively small. Since the fourth quarter of 1958, the contradiction between rolling mills not being able to adapt to steelmaking has become apparent; from the perspective of steel varieties, in 1958, it has increased from 5,000 types in 1957 to 6,000 types, but some varieties, such as heavy rails, thin plates, seamless steel pipes, steel wire ropes, etc., are far from meeting the needs of national economic development, and many special, cold-rolled, and special-shaped steels are even more lacking.

The meeting pointed out that to vigorously increase steel production and ensure the completion and over-completion of the 1959 steel production tasks, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the "walking on two legs" policy in rolling mills. That is, both central enterprises and local enterprises are needed; both "large and foreign" rolling mill enterprises and "small, indigenous and integrated" rolling mill enterprises are needed; both the production potential of existing rolling equipment must be fully tapped, and the construction of new rolling equipment must be accelerated; both the output of steel must be increased, and the variety of steel must be increased, and the quality of steel must be improved. Fully leveraging the potential of existing rolling equipment is a major key to increasing steel production, and these devices will be responsible for more than 60% of the country's steel output in 1959. After discussion and calculation, the meeting decided to increase the daily output level of the nation's existing rolling mills by about 50% in 1959 compared to 1958.

How can the daily output level of existing rolling mills be increased by about 50%? The meeting pointed out that the most fundamental guarantee is to carry out mass movements and technical revolutions in all rolling mill enterprises across the country under the leadership of the Party. The meeting decided to immediately launch a mass technical innovation movement centered on "multiple feeding (multiple feeding of steel) and fast rolling (rapid rolling)" on rolling mills across the country. In order to enable this movement to be launched quickly and widely, the meeting summarized and exchanged various advanced experiences and technical innovation measures in this regard, and formulated a set of basic methods for increasing steel production. More than 50 advanced experiences and major technical innovations exchanged at the meeting included: the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill in reducing passes and increasing reduction; the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill in multiple feeding and rapid rolling; Tangshan Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and Tianjin Steel Plant implemented dual-path rolling, turning one rolling mill into two, and increasing output by 60% to 70%. Shenyang Rolling Mill simultaneously rolled four strands of wire on a wire rolling mill, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Rolling Mill simultaneously rolled four sheets of silicon steel on a silicon steel sheet rolling mill, and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill workshop simultaneously heated four rows of steel ingots and billets in a heating furnace. These innovative initiatives have also rapidly increased production capacity by dozens of percentage points. After hearing these advanced experiences and major technical innovations, the attending representatives believed that they had found a way to increase steel production and their confidence doubled.

The meeting pointed out that while carrying out mass technical innovation movements, it is also necessary to ensure that the nation's rolling mills "eat well and eat their fill," and ensure the supply of sufficient and high-quality steel ingots and billets to rolling mills. To this end, on the one hand, steel enterprises across the country must vigorously improve the quality of steel in order to cast good ingots and facilitate rolling; on the other hand, steel ingots and billets must be uniformly allocated throughout the country to ensure supply.

In order to build the steel production increase movement on a solid and reliable foundation, the representatives of various enterprises attending the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of "10-point targets, 12-point measures," formulated more than 200 measures to increase steel production. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry plans to open training courses to train rolling mill workers, and decided to help those local rolling mill enterprises with relatively poor foundations to solve the problem of large roll supply. Many enterprises established rolling mill production technology mutual aid organizations at the meeting based on regions and specialties, and decided to help each other in the future and work together to increase steel production and expand new steel varieties.

The newly built rolling mill enterprises and rolling mills in various regions are a powerful force for increasing steel production in 1959. It is estimated that from now until the end of the second quarter, many large, medium, and small new rolling mills across the country will be put into production one after another. Therefore, relevant regions and enterprises are required to immediately take various measures and engage in production preparation work as soon as possible, such as: strengthening the organizational work of equipment matching, training production personnel, preparing raw materials and spare parts needed for production, formulating various production procedures and systems, etc., so that these new rolling mills can be put into production as early as possible, and strive to reach the level specified in the design within three to six months after being put into production.

The National Rolling Mill Conference was held in Beijing from December 25th to 31st, 1958. More than 200 people, including the heads and representatives of metallurgical departments (bureaus) of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as various rolling mill enterprises, participated in the meeting.

    轧钢会议决定开展群众性技术革新运动
    增产钢材　扩大品种　提高质量
    要求各地保证供应量足质好的钢锭钢坯
    新华社6日讯　冶金工业部最近召开的全国轧钢会议，决定从现在起在全国范围内大力开展一个增产钢材的运动，号召全国轧钢工人鼓足干劲，千方百计地增产钢材，以保证完成和超额完成1959年的钢材生产计划，最大可能地适应工业、农业、交通运输和其他国民经济部门对钢材数量、品种日益增长的需要。1959年全国钢材生产的任务是：产量将比1958年增长一倍多，品种也要增加近两千种。
    这次全国轧钢会议是根据当前全国钢铁生产形势的需要及时召开的。当前全国钢铁生产的基本形势是：“中间大，两头小”，即冶炼能力比较大；原材料生产能力，包括矿石、焦炭、耐火材料等生产能力和轧钢能力比较小。1958年第四季度以来，已经明显地出现轧钢不能适应炼钢的矛盾；从钢材的品种来看，1958年已经由1957年的五千种增加到六千种，但是有些品种，如重轨、薄板、无缝钢管、钢丝绳等产品，还远不能满足国民经济发展的需要，许多特种的、冷轧的和异形的钢材，更感缺乏。
    这次会议指出，大力增产钢材，保证完成和超额完成1959年的钢材生产任务，必须在轧钢方面认真贯彻执行“用两条腿走路”的方针，这就是说，既要中央企业，又要地方企业；既要“大、洋”轧钢企业，又要“小的、土洋结合的”轧钢企业；既要充分挖掘原有轧钢设备的生产潜力，又要加速建设新的轧钢设备；既要增加钢材的产量，又要增加钢材的品种，提高钢材的质量。而充分发挥原有轧钢设备的潜力，是增产钢材的一个主要关键，这些设备在1959年将担负国家钢材产量中60％以上的任务。会议经过讨论和计算，决定在1959年内把全国现有的轧钢日产量的水平，比1958年提高50％左右。
    怎样才能把现有轧钢机日产量的水平提高50％左右呢？会议指出，最根本的保证是在党的领导下，在全国各轧钢企业里大搞群众运动和技术革命。会议决定，在全国轧钢机上立即掀起一个以“多条（多条喂钢）、快轧（快速轧制）”为中心的群众性技术革新运动。为了使这个运动能够迅速、广泛地展开，这次会议总结和交流了这方面的各项先进经验和技术革新措施，订出了一套增产钢材的基本方法。会上交流的五十多项先进经验和重大技术革新有：鞍钢第一初轧厂的减少道次、加大压下量的经验；鞍钢大型轧钢厂的多条喂钢、快速轧制经验；唐山钢厂、上海第三钢厂和天津钢厂实行了双路轧制，把一部轧钢机变成两部，产量提高60％到70％的经验。沈阳轧钢厂在线材轧机上同时轧制四把线材，太原钢铁公司第二轧钢厂在矽钢片轧机上同时轧制四块薄板，重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间在一座加热炉里同时加热四排钢锭、钢坯等革新创举，也都使生产能力迅速提高了百分之几十。到会代表听到这些先进经验和重大技术革新后，都认为找到了增产钢材的途径，信心倍增。
    会议指出，在开展群众性的技术革新运动的同时，还必须保证全国的轧钢机“吃得饱，吃得好”，保证以足量的、质量好的钢锭、钢坯供应轧钢机。为此，一方面全国各钢铁企业要大力提高钢的质量，以便铸成好锭，利于轧钢；另一方面要在全国范围内统一调配钢锭、钢坯，保证供应。
    为了使钢材增产运动建筑在切实可靠的基础之上，到会各个企业的代表，根据“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神，制订了二百多项增产钢材的措施。冶金工业部计划开办训练班，培训轧钢工人，并决定帮助那些原来基础较差的地方轧钢企业解决大型轧辊的供应问题。许多企业在会上以地区和专业为单位，成立了轧钢生产技术互助组织，决定在今后互助协作，共同努力增产钢材和扩大钢材新品种。
    各地新建的轧钢企业和轧钢机是1959年增产钢材的强大生力军，预计从目前起到第二季末，全国将有许多大、中、小型的新轧钢机陆续投入生产，因此要求各有关地区和有关企业，立即采取各种措施，及早从事生产准备工作，如：加强设备配套的组织工作，培训生产人员，准备生产所需的原材料和备件，制定各种生产规程和制度等等，以便使这些新轧钢机尽早地投入生产，并争取在投入生产后的三个月到六个月内达到设计上规定的水平。
  全国轧钢会议是从1958年12月25日到31日在北京举行的。全国各省、市、自治区冶金厅（局）以及各轧钢企业的负责人和代表共二百多人参加了这次会议。（附图片）
