Our steel industry is advancing along the victorious path of 1958 towards new and great goals. According to the targets set by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, steel production in 1959 will leap to 18 million tons, with the absolute increase exceeding last year's increase by more than 1.1 million tons. This is a great leap forward and a glorious and arduous task. We must ensure its successful completion.

During the nationwide steel production campaign in 1958, not only did iron and steel production grow rapidly, but the production capacity of steel materials and raw materials (including ore, coke, and refractory materials) also increased significantly. In terms of steel rolling, last year's steel output not only significantly increased compared to 1957, but also added more than 1,000 new varieties, with some technical and economic indicators reaching international levels. However, compared to the growth in iron and steelmaking capacity, the rolling capacity and the variety and quality of steel materials still cannot meet the needs of the rapidly developing sectors of the national economy. The growth of raw material production capacity also lags behind the growth of iron and steelmaking capacity. "Large in the middle (iron and steelmaking), small at both ends (raw materials and rolling)" is the new situation facing the steel industry after last year's Great Leap Forward, and it is also the main contradiction in the steel industry today.

The "large in the middle, small at both ends" situation in the steel industry is not at all surprising. Because in the process of development of objective things, some parts will always be ahead, and some parts will be behind. After the lagging parts catch up with the advanced parts, some parts will be ahead again on the new basis, and some parts will be behind. This imbalance in the development of various parts is frequent and absolute. It promotes the lagging parts to learn from the advanced parts, so that our cause is in a state of continuous development. And balance is relative and temporary. This is the law of the development of things. The "large in the middle, small at both ends" situation in the steel industry is a reflection of the law of uneven development of objective things. However, we cannot think that this imbalance can exist for a long time, or even that this imbalance can be expanded indefinitely. The correct attitude should be: while we recognize that the imbalance in the development of various links is an objective law, we must take the initiative to strengthen the work of the backward links, so that they can quickly catch up with the advanced links, so as to establish a new balance on the new basis. In this way, we can continuously push production to new peaks. This is the attitude that promoters should take. Therefore, in order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the task of 18 million tons of steel, to ensure the leap forward in steel production, and to guarantee the needs of various sectors of the national economy for steel varieties and quality, on the steel industry front this year, we must grasp both ends and catch up with the middle. That is, while grasping the production of ore, coke, and refractory materials, we must strive in every possible way to grasp steel rolling production, so that they are compatible with the capacity of steelmaking and ironmaking.

So, how can we make steel production catch up? The fundamental way is to continue to implement the central government's policy of emphasizing both central and local industries, both large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and both modern and indigenous methods of production. In steel rolling production, we must pay attention to both increasing output and expanding varieties, and also pay attention to improving quality. We must not only strive to maximize existing steel rolling production capacity, but also strive to build and expand new steel rolling plants.

Mobilizing the masses and maximizing the production capacity of existing steel rolling equipment is one of the fundamental ways to increase steel production. The experience of last year's production practice tells us that the production potential of existing steel rolling equipment is very large. Some of the high-yield red flags in last year's steel rolling production increased their production level by 60% to 100% compared to 1957, and the level reached at the end of the year was much higher than the level at the beginning of the year. The plans of some advanced factories show that there is still great potential to be tapped this year. For example, the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory, originally designed with a capacity of 60,000 tons, has already reached 150,000 tons last year, but they plan to double it again this year, that is, reach 300,000 tons. The Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory is a highly mechanized and automated factory, and its production capacity can be doubled even after exceeding the design capacity by more than one time. Although the conditions of other factories are different and they may not be able to double it, as long as we seriously tap it, generally speaking, it is entirely possible to increase production by several tens of percent this year compared to last year.

The possibility of increasing production by several tens of percent exists, but to turn possibility into reality, we still need to make great efforts and overcome many difficulties. Recently, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a national steel rolling conference in Beijing. The conference widely exchanged experiences and studied various advanced methods for maximizing existing steel rolling capacity, providing useful experience for increasing steel production this year. According to the experience of various advanced units, the most important thing to maximize the capacity of existing equipment is to implement politics in command and launch mass movements on a large scale. Leaders must dare to mobilize the masses to carry out technological revolution, and closely combine the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses with scientific analysis. While launching mass technological revolution, they should supplement it with appropriate technical organizational measures. The key to carrying out technological revolution in steel rolling production lies in the rolling mill. We must vigorously promote advanced experiences such as feeding steel from multiple strands, rapid rolling, and using continuous rolling methods to achieve more rolling and faster rolling. While improving the production capacity of the rolling mill itself, it is also necessary to correspondingly maximize the capacity of the heating furnace and finishing equipment. In order to ensure that the rolling mill is well-fed and can operate normally and healthily, it is also necessary to improve the quality and supply of steel ingots and billets, and pay attention to the production of rolling rolls and the maintenance and repair of machines. In short, as long as we focus on the production of the rolling mill and mobilize the masses to carry out a series of technological revolutions in finishing, heating, roughing, steel ingots, and machine repair, we can greatly improve the existing production capacity.

Only maximizing the capacity of existing equipment is far from enough to complete this year's steel production task. While grasping the production of old factories with one hand, we must also actively grasp the capital construction of new steel rolling workshops with the other hand. We must ensure that capital construction is done more, faster, better, and more economically, and no aspect should be neglected, especially the quality of capital construction. A batch of rolling mills that have already started construction last year should now be put into production. This year, a large number of new rolling mills will be built and put into production one after another. This is the fresh force to ensure the increase in steel production this year. Ensuring that steel rolling capital construction is put into production quickly and smoothly, and striving to shorten the process of reaching design capacity in production is another major task for us to increase steel production this year. All places and enterprises that are carrying out steel rolling capital construction must immediately strengthen leadership in this regard, vigorously mobilize the masses, seize the manufacture of complete sets of rolling mills, promote rapid installation experience, actively train production and technical personnel, strengthen the production of rolling rolls and spare parts, and prepare all production and organizational work in accordance with the production sequence. This is a arduous political and ideological work, and it is also a meticulous organizational and technical work. Leaders must personally take charge and organize personnel from all parties to cooperate in order to do it well.

Under the huge task of increasing steel production, all parties must fully display the communist style and strengthen cooperation from the overall situation. Whether the task of increasing steel production can be completed is not just a matter for the steel rolling department. The steelmaking department, the transportation department, and other relevant departments also bear important responsibilities and must do their best. For new factories, old factories also bear an unshirkable support task in terms of materials, technology, and other aspects. Steel can play a huge role in the great development of the national economy only when it is rolled into steel products. Now all departments urgently need more steel materials, so we must ideologically recognize the great significance of increasing steel production, promote the overall situation concept, and make a greater leap forward in national steel production.

Steel must become useful, materials must be diverse, and the quality of steel materials must be good—this task is arduous. However, we believe that with the guidance of the Party's correct policies and the valiant efforts of all personnel on the steel front, the grand goal of a greater leap forward this year will surely be successfully completed.

    千方百计增产钢材
    我国钢铁工业正沿着1958年的胜利道路，向新的伟大目标前进。根据党的八届六中全会提出的指标，在1959年钢产量将跃进到一千八百万吨，增长的绝对数量比去年增长的还多一百几十万吨。这是一个伟大的跃进，是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。我们必须保证它的胜利完成。
    在1958年的全民办钢铁运动中，不仅炼铁、炼钢的增长速度很快，而且钢材和原料（包括矿石、焦炭、耐火材料）的生产能力也有很大的增长。在轧钢方面，去年的钢材不仅产量比1957年有了很大的增长，而且品种也增加了一千多种，有的技术和经济指标还达到了国际水平。但是跟炼铁炼钢能力的增长比较起来，轧钢能力和钢材的品种、质量仍然不能满足国民经济各部门急剧发展的需要。原料生产能力的增长，也赶不上炼铁和炼钢能力的增长。中间（炼铁、炼钢）大、两头（原料和轧钢）小，这就是钢铁工业在去年大跃进后所面临的新形势，也是钢铁工业当前的主要矛盾所在。
    钢铁工业的中间大、两头小的情况，一点也不奇怪。因为客观事物在发展过程中，总会有些部分走在前头，有些部分走在后面。落后的部分赶上先进部分以后，在新的基础上，又会有些部分走在前头，有些部分走在后面。这种各个部分发展的不平衡现象是经常的、绝对的，它促进落后的部分向先进的部分看齐，从而使我们的事业处在不断发展的状态中。而平衡则是相对的、暂时的。这是事物发展的规律。钢铁工业出现的中间大、两头小，正是客观事物发展不平衡的规律的反映。但是，也不能认为这种不平衡现象可以长期存在下去，甚至可以无限制地扩大这种不平衡。正确的态度应当是：我们在承认各个环节发展不平衡是客观规律的同时，必须主动地加强落后环节的工作，使它迅速赶上先进环节，以便在新的基础上建立新的平衡。这样就可以把生产不断推向新的高峰。这是促进派应该采取的态度。因此，为了保证完成和超额完成一千八百万吨钢的任务，为了保证钢材生产的跃进，保证国民经济各部门对钢材品种和质量的需要，在今年的钢铁工业战线上，我们必须抓两头、赶中间。即在抓矿石、焦炭、耐火材料的生产的同时，千方百计抓轧钢生产，使它们与炼钢炼铁的能力相适应。
    那末，怎样使钢材的生产赶上前去呢？根本的办法，就在继续贯彻执行中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业与中小型企业并举和洋法生产与土法生产并举的方针下，在轧钢生产方面，必须注意既要增加产量与扩大品种、又要注意提高质量，既要努力发挥现有轧钢生产能力，同时又必须要努力新建、扩建轧钢工厂。
    发动群众，尽量发挥现有轧钢设备的生产能力，是增产钢材的根本途径之一。去年生产实践的经验告诉我们，现有轧钢设备的生产潜力很大。去年轧钢生产中的一些高产红旗，他们的生产水平都比1957年增长了60％到100％，而年底达到的水平又比年初的水平要高的很多。一些先进工厂的规划说明，今年还大有潜力可挖；如鞍山无缝钢管厂，原设计能力为六万吨，而去年已达到十五万吨，但他们打算今年还要翻一番，即达到三十万吨。鞍钢无缝钢管厂是一个高度机械化、自动化的工厂，生产能力已经超过设计能力的一倍多以后，还可以翻一番。别的工厂虽然条件不一样，不一定能够翻一番，但是，只要我们认真去挖，一般说，今年比去年增产百分之几十，是完全可以办得到的。
    增产百分之几十的可能性是存在的，但要把可能性变为现实，还需要经过我们的巨大努力，克服许多的困难。最近，冶金工业部在北京召开了一个全国轧钢会议，会议上广泛交流了经验，研究了发挥现有轧钢能力的各种先进方法，为今年增产钢材提供了有益的经验。根据各先进单位的经验，要发挥现有设备能力，最重要的是实行政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。领导上必须敢于发动群众起来实行技术上的革命，并把群众的革命热情与科学分析紧密地结合起来，在发动群众性的技术革命的同时，辅之以适当的技术组织措施。在轧钢生产方面实行技术革命的关键在于轧钢机，要大力推广多条喂钢、快速轧钢以及采用连续式轧钢方法等多轧快轧的先进经验。在提高轧钢机本身的生产能力时，还须相应地发挥加热炉、精整设备的能力。为了保证轧钢机吃得饱、吃得好，又能正常和健康地运转，还必须改善钢锭和钢坯的质量和供应工作，注意轧辊的生产与机器的维护检修工作。总之，只要围绕轧钢机的生产，同时在精整、加热、初轧、钢锭、机修方面发动群众进行一系列的技术革命，就能大大提高现有生产能力。
    只发挥现有设备能力，还远远不能完成今年钢材的生产任务。在一手抓老厂的生产同时，还必须用另外一只手积极抓紧新轧钢车间的基本建设工作，要保证基本建设的多快好省，不能偏废，特别要注意保证基本建设的质量。去年已经开始建设的一批轧钢机，现在就要投入生产。今年还有大批新的轧钢机要建设起来并陆续投入生产。这是保证今年增产钢材的生力军。保证轧钢基本建设迅速地顺利地投入生产，并且在生产中力争缩短达到设计能力的过程，这是我们今年增产钢材的另一个重大任务。凡是在进行轧钢基本建设的地方和企业单位，必须立即加强这方面的领导，大力发动群众，抓紧成套的轧钢机制造，推广快速安装经验，积极培训生产技术人才，加强轧辊及备品的生产，按生产顺序作好一切生产和组织的准备工作。这一方面是艰苦的政治思想工作，另一方面也是细致的组织与技术工作，必须领导同志亲自挂帅，组织各方面的人员共同协作，才能做好。
    在增产钢材的巨大任务之下，无论是生产或基本建设，各方面必须充分发挥共产主义的风格，要从全局出发，加强协作。增产钢材的任务能否完成，决不单是轧钢部门的事，炼钢部门、运输部门以及其他的有关部门也担负着重大的责任，必须尽力以赴。对于新厂，老厂在物质、技术及其他方面，也担负着义不容辞的支援任务。钢轧成钢材，才能发挥钢在国民经济大发展中的巨大作用。现在各部门都迫切需要更多的钢材，因此我们必须从思想上认识增产钢材的巨大意义，发扬全局观点，使全国钢材生产有一个更大的跃进。
    钢要成材，材要多种，而且钢材的质量要好——这个任务是繁重的。但是，我们相信，有党的正确方针的指导，有钢铁战线上全体人员的奋勇努力，今年的更大跃进的宏伟目标一定能够胜利完成。
