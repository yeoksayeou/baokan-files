*Pravda* Publishes Detailed Communiqué on Space Rocket
Mankind Enters the Era of Direct Exploration of the Universe
Instruments on the Space Rocket Functioning Normally, Obtaining a Large Amount of Valuable Material
Xinhua News Agency, January 12th, Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* published a detailed communiqué on the Soviet space rocket, which has become the first artificial planet in the solar system.
The communiqué listed materials introducing the rocket's flight, the rocket's final stage, the container carrying scientific instruments, the complete set of measuring tools, scientific research tasks, and the artificial sodium cloud comet.
The communiqué emphasized that the scientific instruments on the rocket were functioning normally. A large amount of material recording measurement results has been obtained. This material is being processed.
Preliminary analysis indicates that the research results are of great scientific significance.
These results will be gradually published as observations are processed.
Since the rocket is flying in outer space, it is possible to conduct a series of important scientific experiments to study the interplanetary medium. For the first time, the possibility of conducting direct scientific measurements according to a broad plan has become a reality far from Earth.
The communiqué stated that the launch of the space rocket is a new and outstanding achievement of Soviet science and technology. To achieve space flight, a multi-stage rocket was manufactured, characterized by a highly perfected design and a powerful, high-efficiency rocket engine. The rocket's flight was controlled by a dedicated automatic system, ensuring highly accurate placement into the designated orbit.
The communiqué stated that the launch of the Soviet space rocket signifies that mankind has entered the century of interplanetary flight. Scientists, designers, engineers, technicians, workers, and experimenters offer the launch of the space rocket as a gift to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The communiqué stated that the next stage should be further research into the cosmic space around the sun, research into the planets of the solar system, and the problem of human flight to other planets. Mankind has entered the era of direct exploration of the universe.
The communiqué also included a map of the space rocket's flight path on the Earth's surface, a diagram of the rocket's orbit approaching the moon, a diagram on the star chart showing the rocket's journey to the moon, and an estimated orbit of the artificial planet around the sun.
Also published were pictures of the container with scientific and measuring instruments, the instrument rack carrying instruments and power supply containers, and the markings on the rocket.

Xinhua News Agency, January 12th, Moscow dispatch: On January 12th, *Pravda* published a detailed communiqué about the Soviet space rocket, addressing important issues such as the final stage of the space rocket, the container, instruments, markings, measuring instruments, the rocket's flight, scientific research tasks, the artificial sodium cloud comet, and the rocket's orbit.
The specific content of the communiqué is as follows:

Rocket's Final Stage
The final stage of the space rocket was controlled by an automatic system, which stabilized the rocket's position in the designated orbit and ensured that the designated speed was reached when the engine stopped. After the fuel reserves were exhausted, the weight of the final stage rocket was one thousand four hundred and seventy-two kilograms.
In addition to the devices that ensured the normal flight of the final stage of the rocket, the interior of this stage was also equipped with:
	A separate sealed container with scientific instruments and radio equipment;
	Two radio transmitters with antennas, using frequencies of 19.997 and 19.995 megacycles;
	Cosmic ray counters;
	A radio system for determining the rocket's flight orbit and predicting its continued operation;
	Instruments for creating an artificial sodium cloud comet.

	Container
The container is located at the top of the final stage of the space rocket and has a removable outer shell to prevent heating when passing through the dense atmosphere.
The container consists of two sealed, interconnected, thin, spherical half-shells, one of which is fitted with four radio transmitter antennas, symmetrically mounted on a hollow aluminum shaft. At the end of the shaft is a transmitter for measuring the Earth's magnetic field and detecting the Moon's magnetic field. The antennas extend after the protective shell is jettisoned.
Two proton traps are also mounted on this half-shell to explore the gaseous composition of interstellar matter, as well as two piezoelectric transmitters for studying meteor particles.
The two half-shells of the container are made of a special aluminum-magnesium alloy. The container is filled with gas at a pressure of 1.3 atmospheres, and the temperature is maintained at approximately 20 degrees Celsius. This pressure and temperature are maintained by a special treatment of the outer shell, giving it a certain reflection coefficient and radiation coefficient. The gas flowing in the container obtains heat from the instruments and transfers it to the outer shell, which acts as a special heat sink.

	Instruments
The total weight of the scientific and measuring instruments on the final stage of the space rocket, together with the container and energy devices, is 361.3 kilograms.
The interior of the container is equipped with:
	Radio inspection instruments for the rocket's orbit;
	Radio transmitters;
	Remote control devices for transmitting scientific measurement data and data on temperature and pressure in the container to the ground via radio systems;
	Instruments for studying the gaseous composition of interplanetary matter and solar particle radiation;
	Instruments for measuring the Earth's magnetic field and detecting the Moon's magnetic field;
	Instruments for studying meteor particles, recording heavy atomic nuclei in primary cosmic rays, recording the intensity and intensity variations of cosmic rays, and recording photons in cosmic rays.
The radio instruments and scientific instruments in the container are powered by silver-zinc batteries and oxygen-mercury battery packs.
The separation of the container from the final stage rocket occurs after the power unit of the final stage rocket finishes working.

	Markings
Two markings bearing the Soviet national emblem are placed inside the rocket's container.
One marking (previously translated as flag) is a very thin metal strip with the words "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" written on one side and the Soviet national emblem and the words "January 1959" on the other. The inscription is written using a special photochemical method to ensure long-term durability.
The second marking is spherical, with many pentagonal pieces made of special stainless steel on its surface. Some of these pieces have raised lettering saying "USSR, January 1959," while others have the Soviet national emblem and the word "USSR."

	Measuring Instruments
To observe the flight of the space rocket, measure its orbital parameters, and receive scientific measurement data from the rocket, a large number of measuring instruments were used throughout the Soviet Union.
The measuring instruments included: automated radio positioning systems for accurately measuring the elements of the initial orbital segment; radio telemetry stations for recording scientific intelligence from the rocket; radio systems for controlling orbital elements of the rocket at great distances from the Earth; radio stations for receiving signals; and optical instruments for observing and photographing the artificial comet.
The data processing was performed using electronic computers at the adjustment calculation center.
Although the weather was unfavorable in most areas where optical instruments were used to observe the space rocket, several photographs of the sodium cloud comet were still taken.
Determining the elements of the rocket's orbit and directly controlling the rocket's movement in space has become possible.
The use of high-power ground transmitters and highly sensitive receivers ensures accurate measurement of the space rocket's orbit at altitudes within 500,000 kilometers.

	The Flight of the Space Rocket
The multi-stage space rocket was launched vertically from the ground. Under the action of the pre-set automatic control system of the rocket, the rocket's trajectory gradually deviated. The rocket's speed also increased rapidly. At the end of the acceleration, the final stage rocket reached the speed necessary for continued flight.
The Soviet space rocket exceeded the second cosmic velocity when the engine of the final stage rocket stopped working.
Approximately one hour after the flight, the rocket entered the constellation Coma Berenices in the celestial sphere. Then, the rocket entered the constellation Virgo in the sky and approached the moon. When the rocket passed by the moon, its position was between Spica and Alpha Librae. The speed of the rocket's movement in the celestial sphere near the moon was about four-fifths slower than the moon's speed.
If viewed from the northern part of the Earth, the moon, on the one hand, revolves around the Earth along its own orbit, and on the other hand, approaches the point of closest approach with the rocket from the right. The rocket approached this point from above and from the right. At the closest distance, the rocket's position was above and slightly to the right of the moon.
It was taken into account in advance that the situation of the rocket passing near the moon could be observed by radio equipment in the Soviet Union, other European countries, and most parts of Africa and Asia.
The time for the space rocket to reach the moon was 34 hours.
According to the determined data, the closest distance of the rocket to the moon was about five to six thousand kilometers, which is equivalent to one and a half times the diameter of the moon.
When the rocket was about one million kilometers and more than one million kilometers away from the Earth, the Earth's gravity on the rocket was reduced to such an extent that the rocket's movement can be considered to be solely due to the sun's gravity.
The Soviet space rocket entered its own orbit around the sun on about January 7th and 8th, becoming the sun's satellite, that is, the world's first artificial planet of the solar system.
The speed of the rocket revolving around the sun as a planet is about 32 kilometers per second.

	Scientific Research
One of the important tasks of the scientific research carried out by the Soviet space rocket is to study cosmic rays.
The nature and origin of this radiation can only be clarified when the instruments are not only outside the Earth's atmosphere but also outside the Earth's magnetic field.
The Soviet space rocket is equipped with various instruments that can comprehensively study the composition of cosmic rays in interplanetary space.
The intensity of cosmic rays was measured using two charged particle counters, and the study of the cosmic ray composition was carried out using two photomultiplier tubes with crystals.
The research carried out on the space rocket makes it possible to measure the composition of cosmic rays in interplanetary space.
The rocket studied the gaseous composition of interplanetary matter and solar particle radiation.
In the current situation of astrophysics, it is impossible to solve the problem of the nature and concentration of interplanetary gas by relying on observations made from the Earth's surface.
The instruments installed on the Soviet space rocket to study the gaseous composition of interplanetary matter and solar particle radiation are intended to carry out the first step of this research - to directly probe stable gases and particle flows in the interplanetary space between the Earth and the Moon, and to roughly estimate the concentration of charged particles in this area.
The experiment was carried out using proton traps.
In order to study the meteoritic material in interplanetary space, two impact piezoelectric transmitters made of ammonium phosphate were installed on the instrument container of the rocket to record meteoritic particle impacts.
With the development of rocket technology and the beginning of the interplanetary navigation century opened by the first Soviet space rocket, the study of meteoritic material has great practical significance for determining the danger of meteors to space rockets and long-term operating artificial satellites.
The study of meteoritic material has important scientific significance for geophysics, astronomy, and for solving the problems of the evolution and occurrence of the planetary system.

The flight of the Soviet space rocket launched towards the Moon with a magnetometer is the first experiment to directly measure the magnetic field of a planet or to discover a planet's magnetic field, because the magnetic field may affect the intensity of cosmic rays in the space around the planet.
In addition to studying the magnetic fields of cosmic celestial bodies, the question of the strength of magnetic fields throughout the entire universe also has great significance.
The purpose of installing a magnetometer on the rocket is to measure the Earth's magnetic field and the possible current magnetic fields in the space within the Moon's orbit; to discover the Moon's magnetic field.
Whether the planets and their satellites in the solar system are magnetized like the Earth is an important question in astronomy and geophysics.

	Sodium Cloud Comet
The use of sodium cloud comets is for optical observation of the space rocket from Earth, in order to confirm the fact that the rocket passed through the predetermined segment on its orbit.
This comet was formed at 3:57 am Moscow time on January 3rd, at a distance of 113,000 kilometers from Earth. The artificial comet can be observed from Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Near East, Africa, and India. The artificial comet has been photographed by specially equipped optical instruments at the southern Soviet observatory.
The choice of the artificial comet formation time took into account that more observation stations in the Soviet Union could observe the comet.
In order to create a sodium cloud comet, the final stage of the space rocket was equipped with special instruments. The sodium evaporator can evaporate one kilogram of sodium completely in five to seven seconds, and eject the sodium cloud in the absence of weight and high vacuum in outer space.

	Orbit of the Space Rocket
The data of the calculated orbit of the artificial planet of the solar system (the possible influence of other planets of the solar system on the rocket is not taken into account) is:
	The plane of the artificial planet's orbit is only slightly inclined to the plane of the Earth's orbit, about one degree;
	The eccentricity of the artificial planet's orbit is equal to 0.148, which is much larger than the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (about 0.017);
	The minimum distance from the sun is about 146 million kilometers (the average distance of the Earth from the sun is about 150 million kilometers);
	The maximum distance from the sun is about 197 million kilometers (47 million kilometers farther than the Earth);
	The period of the artificial planet's revolution around the sun will be 450 days, that is, about fifteen months. The artificial planet will reach the minimum distance from the sun for the first time in mid-January 1959, and the maximum distance will be reached in early September 1959.
	As the rocket and the Earth move around the sun, the distance between the two will change, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing. The maximum distance will reach 300 to 350 million kilometers.
	The distance at which the artificial planet approaches the Earth may reach one million kilometers. (Attached picture)

    苏联“真理报”发表关于宇宙火箭的详细公报
    人类进入直接探索宇宙时代
    宇宙火箭上的仪器工作情况正常获得了大量宝贵材料
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：“真理报”12日发表了关于已经成了太阳系第一个人造行星的苏联宇宙火箭的详细公报。
    公报中列举材料，介绍了火箭的飞行情况、火箭的最后一级、携带科学仪器的容器、全套测量工具、科学研究任务和人造钠云彗星等。
    公报着重指出，火箭上的科学仪器工作情况是正常的。获得了大量记录测量结果的材料。这些材料正在整理中。
    根据初步的分析表明，研究结果有重大科学意义。
    这些结果将随着观察情况的整理逐步公布。
    由于火箭是在宇宙空间飞行，所以可以进行一系列研究行星际介质的重要科学试验。在离地球很远的地方，根据广泛计划进行直接科学测量的可能性已第一次地变为现实。
    公报说，宇宙火箭的发射是苏联科学和技术的新的杰出成就。为了实现宇宙飞行制造了多级火箭，这个火箭的特点是，设计上高度完善和具有强力的高效能火箭发动机。在把火箭极度精确地送入预定轨道时，对火箭飞行的操纵是依靠专门的自动系统进行的。
    公报说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射意味着人类进入了行星际飞行的世纪。科学家、设计师、工程师、技术员、工人和试验者们以宇宙火箭的发射作为对苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的献礼。
    公报说，以后的阶段应当是进一步研究太阳周围的宇宙空间，研究太阳系行星和人飞行到其他行星上去的问题。人类已进入了直接探索宇宙的时代。
    公报还附了宇宙火箭在地球表面的飞行线路图、火箭同月亮接近的轨道图、在星天图上火箭飞往月球的路程图和人造行星围绕太阳运行的估计轨道。
    同时还刊载了带有科学和测量仪器的容器、携带仪器和电源容器的仪器架、火箭上的标记等图片。
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社莫斯科消息：12日“真理报”发表了关于苏联宇宙火箭的详细公报，公报中谈到了宇宙火箭的最后一级、容器、仪器、标记、测量仪器、火箭的飞行、科学研究的任务、人造钠云彗星和火箭轨道等重要问题。
    公报的具体内容如下：火箭最后一级
    宇宙火箭的最后一级是由自动系统控制的，自动系统使火箭在预定轨道上的位置得以稳定，并保证在发动机停止工作时能达到预定速度。在燃料储备用完以后，最后一级火箭的重量为一千四百七十二公斤。
    除了保证火箭最后一级正常飞行的装置以外，这级火箭的内部还装有：
    带科学仪器和无线电仪器的单独的密封容器；
    两台装有天线的无线电发射机，使用的频率是一九·九九七和一九·九九五兆周；
    宇宙射线计数器；
    测定火箭飞行轨道和预测其继续运行用的无线电系统；
    制造人造钠云彗星的仪器。
          容　器
    容器位于宇宙火箭最后一级的上部，它有一个可以卸掉的外壳，以免在通过浓密的大气层时发热。
    容器由两个密闭的互相连结的很薄的球形的半壳组成，其中一个安有四根无线电发射机的天线，对称地装在一根空心的铝制轴上，轴的端部安有一个测量地球磁场和发现月球磁场的发射器。天线在保护外壳抛掉后伸开。
    在这个半壳上还安装有两个质子捕集器，用来探察星际物质的气体成分，还有两台研究流星粒子用的压电发射机。
    容器的两个半壳用特别的铝镁合金制成。容器内装满气体，压力为一点三大气压，温度保持在摄氏二十度左右。保持这种压力和温度的方法是：外壳经过特殊的加工，因而具有一定的反射系数和辐射系数。在容器内流动的气体从仪器获得热量，把它传给外壳，而外壳则是一个特殊的放热器。
          仪　器
    宇宙火箭最后一级上的科学、测量仪器连同容器和能源装置，总的重量为三百六十一点三公斤。
    容器内部装有：
    火箭运行轨道的无线电检查仪器；
    无线电发射机；
    通过无线电系统向地面发送科学测量材料及有关容器中的温度、气压的材料的遥控装置；
    研究行星际物质的气体成分及太阳微粒辐射的仪器；
    测量地球磁场及探查月球磁场的仪器；
    研究流星粒子、纪录原始宇宙线中重原子核、纪录宇宙线的强度和强度变化及纪录宇宙线中光子的仪器。
    容器中的无线电仪器及科学仪器从银——锌蓄电池及氧——汞电池组取得电源。
    容器与最后一级火箭脱离是在最后一级火箭的动力装置结束工作后发生的。
          标　记
    在火箭的容器内装有两个带苏联国徽的标记。
    其中一个标记（前译旗子）是一条很薄的金属带，在金属带的一面写着：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟”，在另一面绘有苏联国徽并写有“1959年·1月”的字样。题字是用特种的光化学方法写成，以保证长期不致磨灭。
    第二个标记是球面形，其表面有许多用特种不锈钢制成的五角形小块。在有一些小块的面上压有凸形字样：“苏联·1959年1月”，在另一些小块面上有苏联国徽和“苏联”的字样。
        测量仪器
    为了观察宇宙火箭的飞行、测定其轨道的参数以及接收火箭发出的科学测量数据，使用了苏联全国各地的大量测量仪器。
    测量仪器中包括：精确测量轨道起始段要素用的自动化无线电定位仪组；记录火箭发出科学情报用的无线电遥测台组，控制与地球距离很远时火箭轨道要素用的无线电系统；接收讯号的无线电台；对人造彗星进行观察和照相用的光学仪器。
    资料的整理是在调整计算中心用电子计算机进行的。
    虽然在使用光学仪器观察宇宙火箭的大部分地区天气都不好，但是，仍然拍到了几张钠云彗星的照片。
    确定火箭轨道的要素和直接控制火箭在空间的运行，已经是可能的了。
    利用大功率的地上发射机和高度灵敏的接收装置，保证准确地测定了宇宙火箭在五十万公里以内的高空运行的轨道。
      宇宙火箭的飞行
    多级宇宙火箭是从地面垂直发射的。在预定的火箭自动控制系统的作用下，火箭的轨道逐渐偏斜。火箭的速度也急速增加。在加速结束时，最后一级火箭达到了继续飞行所必需的速度。
    苏联宇宙火箭在最后一级火箭发动机停止工作的时候，已超过了第二宇宙速度。
    大约飞行一小时以后，火箭在天球内进入了后发星座，然后，火箭在天空内进入室女星座，接近了月球。火箭在月球旁边通过的时候，其位置是在“角宿一”和“天秤一”之间。火箭在天球内靠近月球时的运动速度比月球运动速度约慢五分之四。
    假使从地球北部来观察的话，月球一方面沿自己的轨道绕地球运转，同时又从右方靠近与火箭的接近点。火箭从上方和右方均与这一点相接近。在距离最近的时候，火箭的位置是在月球的上方并稍微偏右。
    事先就考虑到：要使火箭在月球附近通过的情况，能在苏联国土和其他欧洲国家以及非洲和亚洲的大部分地区用无线电设备观察得到。
    宇宙火箭到达月球的运动时间为三十四小时。
    根据已确定的数据，火箭与月球最接近的时候，其距离约五、六千公里，也就是相当于月球直径的一倍半。
    当火箭距离地球约一百万公里和一百万公里以上的时候，地球引力对火箭影响减小到这种程度，以致可以认为火箭的运动仅仅是由于受到太阳引力的作用而产生的。
    苏联宇宙火箭约在1月7、8日就进入了绕太阳运转的自己的轨道，成了太阳的卫星即世界第一个太阳系的人造行星。
    火箭作为行星绕太阳运转的速度每秒钟约为三十二公里。
        科学研究
    苏联宇宙火箭所进行的科学研究的重要任务之一是研究宇宙线。
    只有当仪器不仅处于地球大气层之外，并且处于地球磁场之外时才能搞清这种射线的本质和起源。
    在苏联宇宙火箭上装有可以全面研究行星际空间宇宙线成分的各种仪器。
    利用两台带电粒子计数器测定了宇宙线的强度，而宇宙线成分的研究是利用两架带有晶体的光电倍增器进行的。
    在宇宙火箭上所进行的研究使人们可能测量行星际空间宇宙线的成分。
    火箭研究了行星际物质的气体成分及太阳微粒辐射。
    在天体物理学目前的情况下，依靠从地球表面上所进行的观察是不可能解决行星际气体的性质和浓度的问题的。
    在苏联的宇宙火箭上装置了研究行星际物质的气体成分及太阳微粒辐射的仪器，其目的，是要进行这种研究的第一步——在地球和月球间的行星际空间范围内直接进行探查稳定气体及微粒流的试验，并对这个区域内的带电粒子的浓度作粗略的估计。
    实验是利用质子捕集器进行的。
    为了研究行星际空间的流星物质，在火箭仪器的容器上装有两台记录流星微粒撞击的、用磷酸铵作的撞击压电发射机。
    随着火箭技术的发展及由第一个苏联宇宙火箭所打开的行星际航行世纪的开始，流星物质的研究对于测定流星对宇宙火箭及长期运行的人造卫星的危险性具有重大的纯实践意义。
    流星物质的研究对地球物理学、天文学，对解决行星系的演变和发生的问题有着重要的科学意义。
    带有地磁仪的、向月球方向发射的苏联宇宙火箭的飞行，是直接测量行星的磁场或发现行星的磁场的第一次实验，因为磁场可能对行星周围空间中的宇宙线的强度发生影响。
    除研究宇宙天体的磁场之外，关于整个宇宙空间中磁场强度的问题也有着巨大的意义。
    在火箭上安装地磁仪的目的是：测量地球磁场及月球轨道内空间可能有的电流磁场；发现月球磁场。
    太阳系的行星及它们的卫星是否跟地球一样磁化了，这是天文学及地球物理学的重要问题。
        钠云彗星
    使用钠云彗星，是为了从地球上对宇宙火箭进行光学观察，以便证实火箭经过其轨道上的预定区段的事实。
    这个彗星是在1月3日莫斯科时间三时五十七分，在距地球十一万三千公里的地方形成的。人造彗星可以从中亚细亚、高加索、近东、非洲和印度观察到。人造彗星已由苏联南部天文台专门装置的光学仪器进行了摄影。
    人造彗星行成时间的选择是考虑到，要使苏联有更多的观察站能够观察到这个彗星。
    为了制造钠云彗星，在宇宙火箭的最后一级装有专门仪器。钠的蒸发器能使一公斤的钠在五至七秒钟内全部蒸发，并且在宇宙空间没有重量和高度真空的条件下喷出钠云。
      宇宙火箭的轨道
    已经计算出的太阳系人造行星的轨道的数据（太阳系其他行星对火箭可能引起的影响不计算在内）是：
    人造行星的轨道与地球轨道的平面偏斜很小，在一度左右；
    人造行星轨道的偏心率等于○·一四八，它比地球轨道的偏心率（约○·○一七）要大得多；
    与太阳最小的距离约为一亿四千六百万公里（地球距太阳的平均距离约为一亿五千万公里）；
    与太阳最大的距离约为一亿九千七百万公里（比地球远四千七百万公里）；
    人造行星绕太阳运转的周期将为四百五十昼夜，也就是十五个月左右。人造行星在1959年1月中旬将第一次达到与太阳最小的距离，而最大距离在1959年9月初达到。
    当火箭与地球绕太阳运动时，二者之间的距离将有所变化，有时变大，有时变小。其最大距离将达三亿到三亿五千万公里。
    人造行星与地球靠近时的距离可能达到一百万公里。（附图片）
