Military Spending is Key to Stimulating US Economic Growth
United States　Victor Perlo

Editor's Note: This article by the famous American economist Perlo analyzes the recent economic situation in the United States, pointing out that the industrial production in the United States turned from decline to a certain "recovery" in the second half of last year, due to a series of artificially measures taken by the US government, especially the greatly increased military expenditures. This article is very helpful for understanding the truth of the American economic crisis.

In March of this year, I wrote in an article that the economic downturn at that time was a real crisis of overproduction. This was correct. Even those who defended the status quo admitted that the decline was more serious in nature than previous post-war recessions. I wrote at the time that difficult times would last two or three years. For workers, this statement remains valid. Unemployment this winter appears to be as high as last winter.

But I then expected the downward trend to last longer, and wrote that it would be followed by a period of depression, when production would remain roughly at or near its lowest level. This was incorrect. Production turned upward in May and has now recovered two-thirds of the decline.

The reason for this incorrect assessment was partly due to errors in estimating certain factors, but to a greater extent due to subsequent events (mentioned in that article as a possibility) which could and did change the situation.

The driving force was that government measures to increase public construction and stimulate private housing construction were more effective than I had anticipated. By November 1958, the annual rate of these forms of construction was $4 billion higher than a year earlier, whereas the April 7 article estimated an increase of $2 billion. Also, that article did not take into account increased spending on farm price supports, government salary increases, and veterans' benefits—all of which added $2 billion of stimulus to the economy.

The fact that big business owners were able to quickly restore profit margins was also a factor in the (economic) recovery. They were able to do this by taking full advantage of production automation and an unusually large increase in labor productivity. This somewhat encouraged large companies to increase activity, but kept employment close to the crisis low.

Profit margins will be further improved by the government's large-scale giveaway approach. For example, the Supreme Court's decision to allow natural gas prices to rise rapidly will create such giveaways. This will stimulate people to buy gas pipes, thus "helping business." But this will increase the gas bill for every consumer.

Weapons expenditures: These factors were sufficient to temporarily stop the (production) decline, and after a slight increase in military orders in the first quarter, production began to rise. Such fluctuations are common during economic crises. However, this recovery has gone beyond the "pause in the downward trend."

In my article in the "National Guardian," I asked, "Is the government's recent intensification of its opposition to holding a summit meeting aimed at making it easier to open the door to more drastic corporate-saving 'remedies' on the military front?" This is indeed the case.

In the second quarter of 1958, new military contracts reached a new peacetime high. In the first half of the year, the annual rate of (military) procurement and construction contracts was $27 billion, $9 billion higher than the $18 billion in 1957. This is three times the increase in military spending predicted in the April 7 article.

　　(War) Edge: Then, in the summer, we twice walked to the edge of war over Lebanon and Kinmen. These events did stimulate economic activity. "Business Daily" wrote on July 21: "Just as the economy is trying to get rid of the recession, the recent Middle East crisis has stimulated the economy. There are now three factors that are likely to help the current recovery more.

　　"First, defense spending will almost certainly increase.

　　"The situation of clearing inventory may be stopped, and may even be reversed—at least during the severe stage of the current crisis.

　　"If the crisis continues, and if the psychology of fear of war in the Middle East continues to exist, it will stimulate customers to purchase durable consumer goods."

Since the Kinmen incident followed the Lebanon incident, the crisis continued. Military spending continued to increase. The clearing of inventory has stopped. Except for automobiles, purchases of durable goods have increased sharply. On July 1, steel companies were unable to raise prices due to weak market, but one month later, after the intervention in Lebanon, they raised prices and were able to increase sales.

Key: Military spending and military action are key to the (economic) recovery. Militarism has exacerbated the "stuck state" of unemployment. New orders for missiles and other super weapons require very few laborers. Due to inflation, the contractors of construction projects have increased their deals, but the number of workers used has decreased. The military stimulus gives the economy a frenzied, speculative nature, like the 1929-style stock market boom.

　　The nature of the (economic) recovery outlines the prospects for 1959. Due to the increase of 2 billion dollars in military spending, the deficit of the current fiscal year will reach 12 billion dollars. However, if this new rate of military order contracting is maintained, the military budget must be increased by another 10 billion dollars in the next two years. If Congress passes new bills to maintain the booming business of the construction industry and pay to subsidize the increasing surplus of agricultural products, then tens of billions of dollars will need to be added.

Prices tend to rise more rapidly. The situation of record gold outflow in 1958 may be repeated. The danger of currency devaluation already mentioned in more private commercial publications may become more acute. Some bankers fear such a result because it will reduce the value of monetary capital. Therefore, people are once again hearing calls for economy.

Two pulls: If those who advocate spending a lot of money win, there will be a more frenzied semi-prosperity. Stock prices will rise further, and profits will increase significantly. However, the situation of massive unemployment will continue. The actual income of billions of people will be reduced due to inflation and taxes. The danger of war will increase. None of this will prevent another crisis of overproduction from occurring in a few years.

If fiscal conservatives prevail, the recession trend will soon reappear. Failure to continue the temporary support measures of 1958 would be enough to trigger a new recession.

Perhaps neither side will win an absolute victory. In the event of policy compromises, the life of the economic recovery will not be long, and the likelihood of its reaching a new peak will not be very high. Because some of the negative characteristics that had a great impact in 1957 have become more serious.

No more edges: Due to the completion of construction projects that began at the end of the boom, the situation of excess production capacity is becoming more prominent. The weakening economies of other capitalist countries (which caused the United States' exports to decline in 1958) have become a definite recession, perhaps a global capitalist crisis of overproduction.

The rate of automobile sales will affect the duration of the economic recovery. It is too early to determine how the 1959 models will sell. Which is more influential, particularly favorable loans or particularly high prices?

　　(British and French) attack on Egypt caused US industrial production to reach an unprecedented peak in December 1956. But this was just a flash in the pan of prosperity. Half a year later, the economic crisis began. But the Lebanon and Kinmen crises, which were so beneficial to the enterprise, seem to have disappeared.

However, the momentum they brought will continue to be maintained, and may continue until mid-1959, when there will be the threat of a steel industry strike. Anticipating this situation, steel users will accumulate large inventories, which will make the superficial situation look better than the actual situation. At the same time, the adventurous part of big business owners may shout for another war edge again. Obviously, they may use the Berlin issue if a more suitable event cannot be created during this period.

Will the American people allow this? Or will they finally stop Dulles, so that he can't even reach the edge of the war, and force him to take action to alleviate the real economic problems facing billions of Americans?

### 军费是刺激美国经济上升的关键

    军费是刺激美国经济上升的关键
    美国　维克托·佩洛
    编者按：美国著名经济学家佩洛的这篇文章，分析了美国最近的经济情况，指出去年下半年美国工业生产从下降转而出现某些“恢复”，是由于美国政府所采取的一系列饮鸩止渴的人为措施，特别是大大增加了军事开支的原故。本文对于了解美国经济危机的真象很有帮助。
    今年3月，我在一篇文章中写道，那时的经济活动下降，是真正的生产过剩危机。这是正确的。就是那些为现状辩护的人也承认：那次下降在性质上讲比战后以前几次经济衰退都更加严重。我当时写道，困难的时期将持续两三年。对工人来说，这句话继续有效。今年冬季的失业人数看来同去年冬季一样多。
    但是我当时预料，下降趋势将持续得更长一些，并且写道，之后将是一个萧条时期，这时的生产量大致将保持在最低水平上下。这是不正确的。生产在5月份转而上升，到现在已经恢复了下降部分的三分之二。
    所以造成这种不正确的看法，一部分原因是由于在估计某些因素方面出了差错，但是在更大程度上是由于后来发生了一些情况
  （在那篇文章里曾提到这是可能的），这些情况可以而且也的确改变了情况。
    推动的力量是：政府增加公共建筑和刺激私人造房的各种措施，比我所预料的要有成效。到1958年11月，这些形式的建筑的年率比一年以前要高出四十亿美元，而在4月7日那篇文章中，估计的是增加二十亿美元。还有，那篇文章并没有把增加农产品价格津贴费用、政府薪金增加和退伍军人费用这些因素估计进去——所有这一切，使经济增加了二十亿美元的推动力。
    大企业主们能够很迅速地恢复利润率，这也是促进（经济）恢复的一个原因。他们之所以能够做到这一点，是由于充分利用了生产自动化和劳动生产率的不平常地巨大增长。这多少鼓励了大公司增加活动，但使就业人数保持在接近于危机的最低水平的程度。
    通过政府的大赠送的作法，利润率还将进一步得到提高。譬如，最高法院决定让天然煤气价格迅速上涨就会造成这种大赠送现象。这样将会刺激人们买进煤气管从而“帮助企业”。但是，这将增加每一个消费者的煤气费用。
    武器开支：这些因素足以暂时地阻止（生产）下降，而且在第一季度稍微增加一些军备订货以后，生产有了上升的趋势。在经济危机中，这样的波动是常有的事。但是，这种恢复超出了“下降趋势中的停顿”的程度。
    我在“国民前卫报”发表的那篇文章中曾问道：“最近政府加强其反对举行最高级会议的活动，目的是不是为了在军事方面采取更加剧烈的挽救企业的‘补救办法’大开方便之门？”事实确是如此。
    在1958年第二季度中，新的军事合同达到了和平时期的新的高峰。在上半年，（军事）采购和建筑合同的年率是二百七十亿美元，比1957年的一百八十亿美元高出九十亿美元。这是4月7日那篇文章里所预言的军费增加的三倍。
      （战争）边缘：接着，在夏天，在黎巴嫩和金门问题上，我们两次走到战争边缘。这些事件的确使经济活动受到了刺激。“商务日报”在7月21日写道：“正当经济设法摆脱衰退的时候，最近的中东危机把经济刺激了一下。现在有三个因素大概会对目前的恢复有较大的帮助。
    “一、防务开支几乎肯定地会增加。
    “出清存货的情况可能被阻止，而且甚至可能被倒转过来——至少在目前危机的严重阶段会这样。
    “如果危机延续下去，如果担心中东发生战争的心理继续存在，就会刺激顾客购买耐用消费品。”
    由于在黎巴嫩事件之后金门事件接踵而来，危机是延续了下来。军事开支仍在增加。出清存货的现象已经停止。除了汽车以外，耐用品的购买急剧增加。在7月1日的时候，钢铁公司由于市场疲软而不能提高价格，但是在一个月以后、在干涉黎巴嫩之后，就提高了价格，而且还能够增加销路。
    关键：军事开支和军事行动是（经济）恢复的关键。黩武主义又加剧了失业的“胶着状态”。导弹和其它超级武器的新订货所需要的劳工人数很少。由于通货膨胀，建筑工程的承包商所作的买卖增加了，而使用的工人却减少了。军事的刺激力使得经济具有一种狂热的、投机的性质，就像1929年式的证券市场繁荣一样。
      （经济）恢复的性质勾划出了1959年的前景。由于军事开支增加了二十亿美元，本财政年度的赤字将达一百二十亿美元。但是，如果这种签订军事定货合同的新的速度保持下去，在今后两年中，军备预算必须再增加一百亿美元。如果国会通过新的法案来维持建筑业的兴旺的生意，并且出钱来津贴日益增加的过剩农产品，那末，就还需要增加几十亿美元。
    价格有更迅速地上涨的趋势。1958年黄金外流达到创纪录数额的情况可能重演。更富私人性质的商业出版物里已经提到的货币贬值的危险可能变得更尖锐。某些银行家害怕发生这样的结果，因为这样将会降低货币资本的价值。因此，人们再一次听到了要求节约的呼声。
    两种拉力：要是主张大量花钱的人获得了胜利的话，将出现一种更加狂热的半繁荣状态。股票价格将会进一步上升，利润也将大大增加。但是，大量失业的情形将继续存在。亿万人的实际收入将由于通货膨胀和捐税而减少。战争的危险将会增加。这一切都不会防止在几年内发生另一次生产过剩的危机。
    如果财政上的保守派占了上风，衰退趋势很快就会再一次出现。如果不继续实行1958年的暂时支撑办法，就足以触发一次新的衰退。
    也许双方都不会赢得绝对的胜利。在政策方面实行妥协的情形下，经济恢复的寿命将不会很久，而它的到达新的高峰的可能性也不太大。因为某些在1957年影响很大的消极特点变得更严重了。
    没有更多的边缘了：由于在繁荣末期开工的建设工程完工了，生产能力过剩的情况就显得更加突出了。其他资本主义国家日渐虚弱的经济（它使美国1958年的出口下降）已经成为一次肯定的衰退，也许是一次世界性的资本主义生产过剩的危机。
    汽车的销售率将会影响经济恢复持续的时间。要断定1959型汽车的销路如何，现在还为时过早。条件特别优越的贷款和特别高的价格——究竟哪一样影响更大？
      （英法）对埃及的进攻使美国工业生产在1956年12月达到了前所未有的高峰。但是，这只是繁荣的回光返照。半年以后，经济危机开始了。但是，对于企业有这样好处的黎巴嫩和金门危机看来已经烟消云散了。
    然而，它们带来的动力将继续保持下去，而且可能一直保持到1959年年中，那时就要出现钢铁业罢工的威胁。由于预料到这种情况，各钢铁用户将要积累大量的存货，这样会使表面情况显得比实际情况好一些。同时，大企业主中喜欢冒险的那一部分人可能又要叫嚷另一次战争边缘了。显然，它们可能利用柏林问题，如果在这段时间里不能够制造出更适合的事件的话。
    难道美国人民会允许这样吗？还是他们最后会制止杜勒斯，使他甚至到不了战争边缘，并且迫使他采取行动来缓和亿万美国人所面临的真正经济问题？
