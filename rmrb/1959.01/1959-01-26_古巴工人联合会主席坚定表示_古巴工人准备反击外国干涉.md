Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 25th: David Salvador, President of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, condemned the United States' unreasonable interference in Cuba's internal affairs at a mass demonstration held in Havana on the 21st.

Salvador said: "Those who were not frightened by Batista's crimes in the past have no moral right today to express their hypocritical compassion," "We have won our freedom, and we will defend our sovereignty." Salvador pointed out that "the united working class is prepared to suppress any foreign interference and eliminate the remnants of the Eusebio Mujal group." The Mujal group, under the orders and protection of the Batista reactionary government, previously usurped the leadership of trade union organizations to undermine the Cuban workers' movement.

    古巴工人联合会主席坚定表示
    古巴工人准备反击外国干涉
    新华社25日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴工人联合会主席戴维·萨尔瓦多21日在哈瓦那举行的群众示威大会上谴责了美国对古巴内政的无理干涉。
    萨尔瓦多说：“那些从前没有对巴蒂斯塔的罪行感到恐惧的人们，今天没有道义上的权利来表示他们虚伪的恻隐之心”、“我们赢得了自由，我们将维护我们的主权”。萨尔瓦多指出，“团结一致的工人阶级准备镇压任何外国干涉和消灭欧塞维奥·穆哈尔集团的残余”。穆哈尔集团以前在巴蒂斯塔反动政府的命令和保护下，篡夺了工会组织的领导机构来破坏古巴工人运动。
