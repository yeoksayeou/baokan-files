A Glimpse of the Baotou Steel Works Construction Site
Trucks churn up dust to fill the sky,
Air hammers roar and white clouds rise,
Ten thousand arcs of light flash in the air,
Gods borrow brightness from the human world.
At night, the construction site has ten thousand lights,
For ten miles, the sound of machines can be heard,
Workers twist together into one rope,
On the grassland, a city of steel is built.
Zhang Hongfu, Electrician, Coking Plant

    包钢工地即景卡车卷起漫天尘，气锤怒吼白云生，万道弧光空中闪，神仙向人间借光明。入夜工地万盏灯，十里听见机器声，工人拧成一股绳，草原筑起钢铁城。焦化厂电工　张洪福
