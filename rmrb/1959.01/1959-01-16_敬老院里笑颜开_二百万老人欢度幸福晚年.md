With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the realization of the people's commune system, rural collective welfare undertakings have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Among them, there are more than 100,000 nursing homes across the country, housing approximately two million elderly people. These nursing homes provide a relatively good living place for elderly people without children to rely on.

In order to make the elderly live happily and joyfully, people's communes in various places, within the existing conditions, give appropriate consideration to the elderly in terms of clothing, food, housing, etc., and assign special personnel to take care of the elderly's lives. The houses of nursing homes are generally the better houses in the local area, and many nursing homes are built in places with beautiful scenery with mountains, rivers, flowers and trees. Some elderly people admitted to the homes lack clothing and bedding. Before winter, the people's communes made cotton clothes and quilts for them, ensuring that the elderly spend the cold winter warmly. In order to suit the tastes of the elderly, people's communes in various places have also set up special canteens for nursing homes, providing the elderly with higher food supply standards, allocating more fine grains, and making dishes that the elderly like to eat.

Many of the elderly in nursing homes have worked hard all their lives, carrying work for landlords for decades. In their old age, they did not have the money to marry and start a family. In their past lives, they never enjoyed the warmth of a family and always lived a lonely life. Now, after entering the nursing home, they feel that they have a home, and the nursing home is their big family. In this family, the elderly are as close as brothers and sisters, caring for each other in life; the service staff of the nursing home bring them soup and water, care for them with warmth, cook and wash clothes, and respect them like parents. Many nursing homes also organize recreational activities for the elderly. Playing chess, playing cards, playing and singing songs have become the hobbies of many elderly people; watching movies shown by the commune and watching songs and dances performed by the commune are also frequent events.

Because the elderly in nursing homes are all from the laboring people and love of labor has become their habit, although the people's communes in various places have repeatedly persuaded the elderly to live in peace and not participate in production labor, they always want to find something to do. Therefore, some nursing homes also carry out some light production activities, such as planting some flowers, trees, and raising some chickens, ducks, geese and rabbits, etc., the purpose is to increase the elderly's enjoyment of life and promote the elderly's health.

At present, all localities are combining the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes with the inspection and rectification of the work of nursing homes, so as to run nursing homes better and make the lives of the elderly happier day by day. (Attached picture)

    敬老院里笑颜开
    二百万老人欢度幸福晚年
    本报讯　随着工农业生产的大跃进和人民公社化的实现，农村集体福利事业如雨后春笋般的发展起来，其中敬老院全国就有十万多处，入院的老年人约有二百万。这些敬老院为无子女依靠的老年人提供了一个较好的生活场所。
    各地人民公社为了使老人生活得幸福愉快，都在现有条件下，尽可能对老人们的衣、食、住等方面给以适当的照顾，并派有专人照料老人的生活。敬老院的房屋一般都是当地比较好的房子，许多敬老院是建立在有山、有水、有花草树木的风景幽美的地方。有些入院的老人缺少衣被，人民公社在入冬以前就为他们做好了棉衣、棉被，保证老人们暖暖和和地度过严冬。各地人民公社为了适合老人的胃口，还给敬老院专设了食堂，给老人们较高的伙食供给标准，多调配细粮，多做老人们喜欢吃的饭菜。
    敬老院的老人中间有许多人劳动了一辈子，给地主扛了几十年的活，到老也没钱结婚成家。在他们过去的生活中，没有享受过家庭的温暖，始终过着孤苦伶仃的日子。现在，入了敬老院，他们感到有了家，敬老院就是他们的大家庭。在这个家庭中，老人们亲如兄弟姊妹，生活上相互关心；敬老院的服务人员给他们送汤送水，问寒问暖，做饭洗衣，敬如父母。许多敬老院还为老人组织文娱活动。下象棋、打扑克、弹拉歌唱，已经成了不少老人的喜好；看看公社放映的电影，观赏公社演出的歌舞戏剧，也是经常的事情。
    由于敬老院的老人都是劳动人民出身，热爱劳动已经成了他们的习惯，虽然各地人民公社百般劝告老人们安心养老，不要参加生产劳动，可是他们总想找点活干。因此，有些敬老院也开展了一些轻微的生产活动，如种些花草树木，养些鸡鸭鹅兔等，目的是增加老人的生活乐趣，促进老人的身体健康。
    目前，各地都在结合人民公社的整顿、巩固工作，对敬老院的工作也进行检查整顿，使敬老院办的更好，使老人们的生活一天比一天幸福。（附图片）
