    The Slanderer's "Identity"

    U.S. Senator Wayne Morse recently made a great deal of slander in Congress against the Cuban government's execution of the criminals of the former Batista regime who bloodily slaughtered the people, calling it "domineering" and "incompatible with freedom and democracy."

    Not long after, the Cuban government issued an "invitation" to the U.S. senators and 350 foreign journalists, inviting them to go to Cuba to see the "truth of the situation" for themselves. Of course, Morse also received the invitation. But this senator did not accept the "invitation," claiming that he was not suited for the "identity." It turns out that Morse's "identity" is only suitable for being a slanderer who makes irresponsible remarks and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. He dared not accept Cuba's "invitation" precisely because he was afraid of exposing his shameful "identity" in front of the Cuban people!

### 诽谤者的“身份”

    诽谤者的“身份”
    美国参议员魏恩·莫尔斯前几天在国会里大肆污蔑古巴政府处决前巴蒂斯塔政权下血腥屠杀人民的罪犯是“霸道”，“同自由和民主不相容”。
    事隔不久，古巴政府向美国参议员们和三百五十名外国记者发出了“邀请”，请他们到古巴去亲自看看“情况的真相”。当然，莫尔斯也接到了请帖。但是这位参议员没有接受“邀请”，据他自称，是因为他不合“身份”。原来莫尔斯的“身份”只适合做一个信口雌黄的诽谤者和干涉他国内政的人。他不敢接受古巴的“邀请”，正是因为他害怕在古巴人民面前暴露他的可耻的“身份”！
