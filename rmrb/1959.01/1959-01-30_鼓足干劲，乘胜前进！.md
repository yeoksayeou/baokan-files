A year ago, this newspaper published the fighting slogan first proposed by the people of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province: "Ten parts target, twelve parts measures, twenty-four parts effort!" This slogan expressed the wishes of the people across the country, quickly spreading and becoming a call to battle. It was precisely because of advanced targets, practical measures, and soaring effort that China achieved a great leap forward last year, doubling steel, coal, grain, and cotton production. Today, at the beginning of a year of even greater leap forward, this newspaper publishes the people of Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province's bold leap forward initiative and the news that the people of Suzhou Prefecture are launching a competition to respond to this initiative. We hope that all parts of the country will, like the people of Yangzhong and Suzhou Prefecture, continue to exert full effort, strive for the upstream, and launch a vigorous production upsurge even greater than last year, in order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

In order to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in order to rapidly change China's economic and cultural backwardness, the Chinese people fought hard for a year last year and achieved brilliant successes. For the same purpose, the Chinese people still need to continue to fight hard this year and strive for greater victories. Last year, China doubled the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. Both the scale and speed were unprecedented, but to fundamentally change China's economic face, one must never be satisfied with the achievements already made. Last year, China produced 750 billion jin of grain, an average of more than 1,100 jin per person. The amount is not small, and it is certainly enough for people to eat. However, it is also necessary to feed livestock, pigs, chickens, and ducks. Now these livestock and domestic animals are not more but less, and they need to be greatly developed, which makes the grain seem not abundant. Moreover, it is also necessary to consider the grain used for industrial processing, such as brewing, milling, making sauce, and making pastries. Therefore, the grain problem cannot be said to have been completely solved, and production must be greatly increased. As for cotton, 67 million dan were produced last year, averaging only ten jin per person. Moreover, the amount of cloth used for industrial purposes and public use is very large, and the remaining amount of cloth for personal use is very limited. As for oil crops, although production increased by about 30% last year, producing more than 3 million tons of vegetable oil, averaging less than ten jin per person, it is also very little, and it also includes industrial oil. Therefore, from the agricultural point of view, although last year's great leap forward has greatly improved the eating and clothing problems of the Chinese people, it is still far from our long-term goal of a well-fed and well-clothed life. To develop industry, it is also necessary to develop agriculture. 80% of the raw materials in light industry come from rural areas. In a country like ours with a large population and a relatively backward agricultural base, rapidly developing agriculture, completely solving the problem of grain and meat, and providing sufficient raw materials for industry is a long-term and major task. Whether from the urgent needs of the present or from the long-term economic development, we must, according to the spirit of continuous revolution that Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us, make China's agriculture have a greater leap forward this year after last year's great leap forward. It is precisely for this reason that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which was held not long ago, put forward this year's leap forward targets: grain production should be increased to about 1,050 billion jin, and cotton production should be increased to about 100 million dan. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party "called on the whole Party and the whole people to unite as one, follow the victorious road of 1958 and fight bravely, strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, so that China can achieve a greater leap forward than in 1958 in the decisive year of three years of hard work."

The agricultural production increase targets for 1959 proposed by the Party Central Committee are targets for a greater leap forward. It is by no means easy to achieve these targets. Although the planned grain and cotton production this year only increases by about 50% in speed compared with last year, the absolute increase is equivalent to the absolute increase last year, and the total output is about twice that of the previous year. Moreover, it should also be seen that agricultural production is different from industrial production. It cannot increase production on the basis of the equipment capacity already achieved in the previous year, as industrial production can, but must start from scratch. In agricultural production, it is also a rare and magnificent plan in history to continuously leap forward so significantly. To achieve this plan, of course, there are difficulties. This requires us, on the one hand, to despise difficulties, dare to continuously revolutionize, and bravely leap forward firmly; on the other hand, we must pay attention to difficulties, we must take out greater effort than last year, take more effective measures, and pay greater effort. That is to say, our slogan is still "Ten parts target, twelve parts measures, twenty-four parts effort." The Party organizations and the masses of the people in many parts of the country are doing just that. The broad masses of the working people in our country have both heroic and fearless spirit, and also the spirit of practical and skillful work. The news from Yangzhong County and other places in Jiangsu published in this newspaper today is the best example. The 200,000 heroic people of Yangzhong County are marching with vigorous strides towards a new great goal - striving for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of more than 100,000 mu of three wheats (wheat, barley, yuan wheat) in the whole county. Not long ago, they proposed to all counties and cities in Jiangsu Province to carry out a competition for high yield on a large area of three wheats, which was quickly responded to by the people of Suzhou Prefecture. The people of Suzhou Prefecture have already put forward the slogan "Three wheats catch up with rice" and strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of 2.9 million mu of wheat fields in the whole prefecture. The people of Changshu County, who first proposed the slogan "Ten parts target, twelve parts measures, twenty-four parts effort" last year and have made remarkable achievements in the large-area high-yield movement, proposed to surpass Yangzhong and strive for a yield of 1,200 jin per mu of three wheats in the whole county. They also proposed to achieve comprehensive high yields of green manure, rape, broad beans, peas and other spring flowering crops. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the people there have greater enthusiasm than last year, more measures than last year, earlier actions than last year, and better organization than last year. They are determined to win the first battle of this year's great leap forward. While proposing higher targets, the Party organizations and the masses of the people in Yangzhong County and Suzhou Prefecture have taken more practical and reliable measures: both better technical measures and better organizational measures; new improvements in leadership methods, and further strengthening of ideological work. Among them, the most important thing is that the Party committee secretary takes the lead and carries out mass movements on a large scale. A large-scale, nationwide mass movement centered on accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and topdressing fertilizer has been launched. Millions of commune members are not afraid of the cold weather and do everything possible to skillfully apply winter fertilizer to ensure strong seedlings overwinter. With the spirit of "managing wheat like embroidery," they carefully process on hundreds of thousands of mu and millions of mu of large areas, striving to realize the horticulturalization of the land. They are doing the right thing and doing it well! This spirit of continuous revolution, this spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm and practical measures, is the guarantee of our great victory last year and the guarantee that we will achieve a greater leap forward this year. It is this vigorous fighting spirit that many places are now promoting and that all places in the country need to greatly promote.

This year, achieving a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front has more favorable conditions than last year, that is: 1. After communization, labor and means of production can be scheduled and used more reasonably and effectively in a larger scope; 2. Cadres and members have studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Plenary Session, their thoughts have been further liberated, their enthusiasm has been further boosted, and their work style has become more meticulous and down-to-earth; 3. All regions are rectifying and improving people's communes in accordance with the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session, and have absorbed many valuable experiences and lessons from last year, and have made great progress in leadership methods, labor organization, and labor deployment compared with the past; 4. With last year's bumper harvest, there is a relatively solid material basis for striving for a greater harvest this year; 5. With last year's great leap forward, there is more abundant technical experience for striving for a greater leap forward this year. With these more favorable conditions, there is every reason to strive for a greater harvest this year. From the news of Yangzhong County and Suzhou Prefecture published in this newspaper today, we can also see that the conditions for striving for a large-area high yield of three wheats this year are also very good. This year, the "head" of three wheats is grasped well, and it can also be said that the "roots" of three wheats are well扎 (扎 means “stab” but can also mean taking root). The 2.9 million mu of three wheats in Suzhou Prefecture are generally deeply ploughed about one foot deep, and more than 40 jin are sown per mu. Generally, fine varieties are carefully selected, sufficient base fertilizer is applied, and sowing is timely and meticulous. At present, wheat seedlings are growing well, with first-class fields accounting for more than 60% and second-class fields accounting for more than 30%. Compared with the situation of "congenital deficiency" of three wheats last year, we can more clearly understand how valuable these conditions are. Since the summer harvest crops last year only strengthened the field management in the middle and late stages, they achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Then, this year, we will firmly grasp the "head," "waist," and "tail," and add many other favorable conditions. Why can't we get a greater harvest this summer? The conditions for spring sowing this year are also better than last year. Most of the more than one billion mu of land waiting for spring sowing has been deeply ploughed. The movement to accumulate fertilizer and make fertilizer, which is being launched on a large scale everywhere, is bound to give more and better fertilizer to spring sowing crops. Some of the water conservancy projects built last year did not have time to use last year, and this year they can play a greater role; the new projects built this year focus on benefiting in the same year, which will also be of great help to this year's production increase. More and better seeds have been left than in the past. The technology of close planting and field management is also more improved and skilled than in the past. Since all conditions are better than last year, what reason can we say that we cannot get a greater harvest than last year this year?

The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, which ended at the beginning of this year, warmly responded to the call of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and put forward ten major initiatives for achieving a great leap forward this year, to continue to exert full effort, oppose conservative ideas, ensure the completion and strive to exceed the grain and cotton production targets put forward by the Party Central Committee this year, and vigorously develop oil crops, flax, sugar crops, tobacco leaves, silk, tea and other industrial raw material crops and the production of pigs, chickens, ducks, egg products, aquatic products and vegetables. Now, the first clarion call for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year has sounded. Summer harvest crops account for a large proportion of the crops throughout the year; a greater summer harvest is of great significance for the completion of the annual plan and for promoting a greater leap forward throughout the year. Comrades on the agricultural front, let us all, like the people of Suzhou Prefecture and Yangzhong County, hold high the red flag and advance on victory! With the great achievements and rich experience of the great leap forward in 1958, the Party's leadership is stronger, and the strength of the masses is more abundant. We must get greater victories, and we will surely get greater victories!

### 鼓足干劲，乘胜前进！

    鼓足干劲，乘胜前进！
    一年以前，本报发表了江苏省常熟县人民首先提出的“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲！”的战斗口号。这个口号表达了全国人民的心愿，很快就传遍了全国，成了战斗的号角。正是由于有了先进的指标、切实的措施和冲天的干劲，我国去年实现了钢、煤、粮、棉翻一番的大跃进。今天，在更大跃进的一年开始的时候，本报又发表江苏省扬中县人民的豪迈的跃进的倡议和苏州专区人民为响应这个倡议而展开竞赛的消息。我们希望，全国各地都像扬中人民和苏州专区人民一样，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而掀起一个轰轰烈烈的声势比去年更大的生产高潮。
    为了多快好省地建设社会主义，为了迅速地改变我国经济上和文化上的落后状况，去年我国人民苦战了一年，获得了辉煌的成就；为了同样的目的，今年我国人民仍然需要继续苦战，争取更大的胜利。去年我国实现了钢、煤、粮、棉产量翻一番，无论在规模和速度上都是空前的，但是，要根本改变我国的经济面貌，就绝不能满足于已得的成就。去年我国生产了七千五百亿斤粮食，平均每人有一千一百多斤，数目不算少，单是人吃当然足够了，但是，还要喂牲口，喂猪、鸡、鸭，现在这些牲畜和家畜不是多了而是少了，还要大发展，这就显得粮食不富裕。而且还要考虑到工业加工用粮，如酿酒、制粉、造酱以及制点心等等。因此粮食问题还不能说已经完全解决了，还必须大大增产。又如棉花，去年生产了六千七百万担，平均每人只有十斤，而且工业用布和公用布的数量很大，余下的个人用布的数量就很有限了。又如油料作物，去年虽然增产30％左右，约可产植物油三百多万吨，平均每人不到十斤，也是很少的，而且还包括工业用油。因此，从农业方面说，去年的大跃进虽然已经对我国人民的吃、穿问题有了很大的改善，但是同我们的丰衣足食的远大目标比较起来，还差得很远。为了发展工业，也要发展农业，轻工业中有80％的原料是来自农村的。在我们这样一个人口众多而农业的原有基础又比较落后的国家里，迅速地发展农业，彻底解决粮食和肉食问题，并为工业提供充足的原料，是一个长时期的重大任务。无论从当前的迫切需要或者从长远的经济发展来看，我们必须根据毛泽东同志经常告诉我们的不断革命的精神，使我国农业在去年大跃进之后今年仍然有一个更大的跃进。正因为这个缘故，不久以前召开的党的八届六中全会提出了今年的跃进指标：粮食产量要增加到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花产量要增加到一亿担左右。党的八届六中全会“号召全党全民团结一致，沿着1958年的胜利道路英勇奋斗，争取完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济计划，使我国在苦战三年的决定性的一年中，实现比1958年更伟大的跃进”。
    党中央提出的1959年的农业增产指标，是更大跃进的指标。要实现这些指标，决不是轻而易举的事情。今年粮棉的计划产量虽然在速度上比去年只增加50％左右，但是，从增产的绝对数来看，则相当于去年的增产的绝对数，总产量则比前年增加两倍左右。而且还要看到，农业生产不同于工业生产，它不能像工业生产那样可以在上一年已经达到的设备能力的基础上增产，而必须从头做起。在农业生产上，要这样大幅度地连续跃进，在历史上说也是一个罕见的宏伟计划。要实现这个计划当然不是没有困难的。这要求我们一方面要藐视困难，敢于不断革命，坚定不移地奋勇跃进；另一方面又要重视困难，一定要比去年拿出更大的干劲，采取更有力的措施，付出更大的力量。这也就是说，我们的口号仍然是“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲。”全国许多地区的党组织和人民群众，正是这样做的。我国广大劳动人民既有英勇无畏的气概，也有实干巧干的精神。今天本报发表的江苏扬中等地的消息，就是最好的例证。扬中县二十万英雄的人民，正迈着健壮的步伐向新的伟大目标进军——力争全县十万多亩三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）亩产千斤。他们在不久以前向江苏全省各县市提出了开展三麦大面积高产竞赛的倡议，很快地得到了苏州专区人民的响应。苏州专区人民已经提出了“三麦再赶水稻”的口号，力争全专区二百九十万亩麦田亩产千斤。去年最早提出“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的口号、并在大面积丰产运动中有显著成就的常熟县人民，提出要超过扬中，力争全县三麦亩产一千二百斤。他们还提出要实现绿肥、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等春花作物全面高产。现在，那里的人民群众，在党的领导下，干劲比去年更大，措施比去年更多，行动比去年更早，组织比去年更好，抱定了必胜的决心，要打赢今年大跃进的第一仗。扬中县和苏州专区的党组织和人民群众在提出更高的指标的同时，就采取了更多的切实可靠的措施：既有更好的技术措施，也有更好的组织措施；领导方法有新的改进，思想工作也进一步加强。其中最重要的是党委书记挂帅，大搞群众运动。一个大规模的全民性的以积肥造肥追肥为中心的群众运动已经展开。千百万公社社员不怕天寒地冻，千方百计巧施腊肥，确保壮苗过冬。他们用“管麦如绣花”的精神，在几十万亩、几百万亩的大面积上精细加工，力求实现大地园艺化。他们干得对，干得好！这种不断革命的精神，这种冲天干劲和切实措施相结合的精神，正是我们去年获得伟大胜利的保证，也是我们今年要实现更大的跃进的保证。现在许多地方正在发扬的和全国所有地方都需要大大发扬的，正是这种旺盛的战斗精神。
    今年在农业战线上，实现更大更好更全面的跃进，有着比去年更有利的条件，这就是：一、公社化以后，劳动力和生产资料可以在更大的范围内更合理更有效地调度使用；二、干部和社员学习了六中全会文件，思想进一步解放，干劲进一步高涨，作风也更加细致、踏实；三、各地正在根据六中全会的决议整顿和提高人民公社，并且吸取了去年的许多宝贵经验和教训，在领导方法、劳动组织、劳力调配等方面都比过去大有进步；四、有了去年的大丰收，今年争取更大丰收有比较雄厚的物质基础；五、有了去年的大跃进，今年争取更大跃进有比较丰富的技术经验。有了这些更有利的条件，就完全有理由今年争取更大的丰收。从今天本报发表的扬中县和苏州专区的消息中，也可以看到争取今年三麦大面积高产的条件也是很好的。今年对三麦的“头”抓得好，也可以说是三麦的“根”扎得好。苏州专区的二百九十万亩三麦，一般的深翻一尺左右，每亩播种四十多斤，普遍精选良种，施足基肥，播种适时而且细致。当前麦苗生长良好，一类田在60％以上，二类田在30％以上。同去年三麦“先天不足”的情况相比，就可以更清楚地了解，这些条件是多么可贵。既然，去年的夏收作物，只是加强了中期、后期的田间管理，就取得了史无前例的大丰收；那末，今年把“头”“腰”“尾”都紧紧抓住，又加上别的许多有利条件，我们为什么不能在今年夏季得到更大的丰收？今年春播的条件也比去年更好了。十多亿亩等待春播的土地，大部分已经深耕。目前各地正在大张旗鼓展开的积肥造肥运动，势必给春播作物更多更好的肥料。去年兴修的水利工程，有一些在去年没有来得及用上，今年可以发挥更大的作用；今年新修的着重当年受益，对今年的增产也会大有帮助。种子也比过去留得更多更好了。密植和田间管理的技术，也比过去更提高更熟练了。既然各种条件都比去年更好，有什么理由能说我们在今年不能得到比去年更大的丰收？
    今年初结束的全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议热烈响应党的八届六中全会的号召，提出了实现今年大跃进的十大倡议，要继续鼓足干劲，反对保守思想，保证完成和力争超过党中央所提出的今年粮、棉的产量的指标，并且大力发展油料作物、麻类、糖料、烟叶、丝、茶以及其他工业原料作物和猪、鸡、鸭、蛋品、水产和蔬菜的生产。现在，今年更大更好更全面地跃进的第一声号角已经响了。夏收作物在全年的作物中占不小的比重；夏季更大丰收，对于全年计划的完成，对于促进全年的更大跃进有着重大的意义。农业战线上的同志们，让我们都同苏州专区和扬中县人民一样，高举红旗，乘胜前进吧！有了1958年大跃进的伟大成就和丰富经验，党的领导更坚强了，群众的力量更雄厚了。我们必须得到更大的胜利，我们必定得到更大的胜利！
