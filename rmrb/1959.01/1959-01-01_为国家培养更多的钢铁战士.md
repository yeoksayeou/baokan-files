    Cultivating More Steel Warriors for the Nation
    Zhao Yuming, Youth Furnace Chief of the First Converter Workshop, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant
    Shortly after the news of the nation completing 10.7 million tons of steel came, Shanghai's leap forward target of 1.2 million tons of steel for last year was also completed. These successive good news stories are truly overwhelming and exciting for us steelworkers who are directly fighting for steel.
    In this extraordinary year, China's steel production more than doubled, which is a great victory for the general line of building socialism put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In order to achieve this victory, we overcame various difficulties on the road forward. Taking our Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant as an example, last year's output greatly increased compared to the previous year. The original small number of veteran steelworkers were either transferred or left, leaving very few. The factory added more than twice as many new workers. Some were tricycle workers, some were vendors and tailors, and there were also a large number of young students. Most of them had never even seen a steelmaking furnace, let alone how to make steel. Therefore, we faced a dual task: to fulfill the state plan and produce more steel, and to cultivate a steel warrior contingent that was both numerous, fast, and good.
    When a large number of new workers were transferred to our First Converter Workshop, I was the only one on our No. 3 furnace who had worked for a longer period of time. I was both happy and worried. I was happy because this was an important task, and worried because I was only twenty-three years old this year and afraid that I would not be able to complete this task. But when I thought that more and better steel production required more people, I was determined to do a good job in training. I usually took the time to explain basic production knowledge and practical operation techniques to the new workers; sometimes when the furnace stopped for baking, I would give them demonstrations; after they mastered some basic operations, I would boldly let them take on the work of shaking the furnace and watching the fire; if an accident occurred, we would analyze the reasons together. Through mutual help and common improvement, since May of last year, we have trained six or seven furnace chiefs and more than thirty first and second assistants in our furnace, who have supported the newly built steel factories in other places and in Shanghai.
    1959 is the decisive year of the three years of hard struggle. Steel production is to be increased from 11 million tons last year to 18 million tons. The small-scale indigenous furnaces in various places need to be rectified and improved, and the quality of steel is also required to be further improved. This requires our old steel plants to train more new steelworkers. I am determined to work hard to improve my technical level, do everything I can, redouble my efforts, patiently and meticulously, and unreservedly teach my experience to others, so that more people can master steelmaking technology, and strive to produce more and better steel in 1959.

    为国家培养更多的钢铁战士
    上钢三厂第一转炉车间青年炉长　赵玉明
    在全国完成一千零七十万吨钢的消息传来不久，上海去年一百二十万吨钢的跃进指标也完成了。这一个接着一个的捷报，对直接为钢而战的我们炼钢工人来说，真是压抑不住内心的兴奋和激动。
    在这不平凡的一年内，我国钢产量翻了一倍多，这是党中央和毛主席提出的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利。为了取得这一个胜利，我们克服了前进道路上的种种困难。以我们上钢三厂来说，去年产量比前年大大增加，原来就为数不多的老炼钢工人，抽的抽，调的调，剩下无几，全厂增加了两倍多新工人。他们有的是三轮车工人，有的是摊贩、裁缝，还有大批青年学生，大部分人连炼钢炉都没有见到过，更不用说怎样炼钢了。因此，放在我们面前的双重任务是：既要完成国家计划，炼出更多的钢，又要又多又快又好地培养一支钢铁战士。
    我们第一转炉车间调来大批新工人时，我们的三号炉子只有我一个人工作时间较长，我心里又高兴又担心，高兴的是因为这是一件有着重要意义的事情；担心的是我自己今年只有二十三岁，怕完成不了这项任务。但当我想到要增产更多更好的钢一定要有更多的人的时候，我就下决心做好培训工作。在平时一有空就给新工人讲解基本生产知识和实际操作技术；有时炉子停下来烘炉，就向他们作示范表演；等他们掌握了一些基本操作后，就大胆放手让他们担任摇炉、看火工作；发生意外事故，就一起分析原因。这样互相帮助，共同提高，从去年5月份到现在，在我们炉子上已经培养出了六、七个炉长，三十多个一助手、二助手，支援了外地和上海新建的钢铁工厂。
    1959年是苦战三年的决定性的一年，钢的产量要从去年的一千一百万吨提高到一千八百万吨，各地的小土群要整顿提高，钢的质量也要求进一步提高，这就需要我们老钢厂培养更多的新炼钢工人。我决心努力提高自己的技术水平，尽一切力量，再接再厉，耐心细致、毫无保留地把自己的经验教给别人，让更多的人掌握炼钢技术，为1959年炼出更多更好的钢而努力。
