China is one of the earliest countries to cultivate citrus fruits. Records date back to the Xia Dynasty during the reign of Yu the Great around 2200 BC, indicating a cultivation history of over 4,000 years. By the Han Dynasty, citrus cultivation was already well-developed. The "Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of the Money-Makers" states, "A thousand tangerine trees in Shu Han Jiangling are equivalent to a marquis with a thousand households," illustrating large-scale cultivation at that time. Han Yanzhi's "Treatise on Oranges" from the Song Dynasty provides detailed descriptions of citrus classification, cultivation, and utilization. In the past, poets and painters also created many moving descriptions of orange orchards. "Remember, the best scenery of the year is when the oranges are yellow and the tangerines are green," is a description by the Song Dynasty poet Su Shi of the lovely scene of the evergreen leaves and brightly colored fruits in the orange orchards.

The Chinese people have accumulated rich experience in citrus cultivation, cultivating many excellent varieties. The "Wenzhou Mandarin Orange," now cultivated in many countries around the world, originated in China. Shantou Mandarin Orange and Banana Orange are among the best citrus varieties in the world. Banana Oranges are not only fragrant and delicious, sweet and sour, but also very resistant to transportation and storage.

Citrus fruits prefer a warm climate. It is roughly estimated that China's suitable citrus cultivation area accounts for about one-third of the world's suitable area. The vast area south of the Yangtze River in China is suitable for planting. The Chinese people, based on natural conditions, have created various unique cultivation methods, allowing planting on mountains, hills, plains, or paddy fields. In some colder areas of the north, experimental planting of certain cold-resistant citrus varieties is also underway.

China's citrus fruits are not only cultivated with a long history but also boast rich and colorful varieties. They can be mainly divided into oranges, mandarins, tangerines, pomelos, kumquats, lemons, and other categories.

Oranges: The fruit is round, large, with a sweet and sour taste, and high nutritional value. In Sichuan and Hunan, it is called "Guanggan." The Snow Orange of Fujian, the Xinhui Orange of Guangdong, and the Goose Egg Orange of Jiangjin, Sichuan, are among the best oranges.

Tangerines: The fruit is relatively small, the skin is loose and easy to peel, making it convenient to eat. They are cultivated in a wide range and have a large yield. Famous varieties include the Local Early Tangerine of Zhejiang, the Fu Tangerine of Fujian, and the Nanfeng Mandarin Orange of Jiangxi.

Mandarins: A species between oranges and tangerines, more cold-resistant; the fruit is large, nearly round, with a thick but loose and easy-to-peel skin. The best varieties include the Banana Orange and Ponkan (also known as Shantou Mandarin Orange) of Guangdong and Fujian, and the Wenzhou Mandarin Orange of Hunan and Zhejiang.

Pomelos: The largest type of citrus fruit, with some weighing several kilograms, light yellow in color, and selling well in the domestic market.

Lemons: Fragrant and sour, mainly used for slicing and making lemon tea. They are rarely eaten directly in China but are very popular in the international market. In addition, there are also very small kumquats, Buddha's Hand citrons for ornamental purposes, and Daidai oranges used for scenting tea, all of which are citrus fruit trees.

The nutritional value of citrus fruits is among the best of general fruits. They are also one of the main export fruits, with high economic value; exporting one ton of citrus fruits can be exchanged for two tons of steel or four tons of gasoline. Tangerine peel, reticulum, and seeds are also Chinese medicinal materials. Citrus trees are evergreen year-round, with fragrant flowers and beautiful fruits; therefore, they are also a good type of forest tree for beautifying nature and decorating courtyards. After liberation, China's citrus cultivation has greatly developed. In 1958, the national cultivation area reached more than 1.4 million mu, with a total output of about 8 million dan. However, the existing quantity still cannot meet the needs of people's lives and export sales, and citrus trees should be developed in large quantities. (Attached picture)

    我国柑桔品种多历史久
    我国是栽培柑桔很早的国家，早在纪元前二千二百年夏禹时代已有记载，在我国栽培的历史已有四千多年。到汉朝时候，柑桔栽培已很发达。史记货殖列传记载：“蜀汉江陵千树桔，其人与千户侯等”。说明当时已大规模栽培。宋朝韩彦直所著的“桔录”中，对柑桔的分类，栽培和利用已有详细的记载。过去的诗人、画家对桔园也有很多动人的描述。“一年好景君须记，正是橙黄桔绿时”，就是宋朝诗人苏轼对当时桔园叶色常绿，果实鲜艳的可爱景色的描述。
    我国人民对柑桔的栽培积累了丰富的经验，培养出许多优良品种。现在世界上有不少国家栽培的“温州蜜桔”就是出自我国。汕头蜜桔和蕉柑都属于世界上最好的柑桔品种。蕉柑不但芳香味美，甜酸可口，且很耐运输贮藏。
    柑桔喜欢温暖的气候，据粗略估计，我国适宜栽培柑桔的面积约占全世界适宜栽培柑桔面积的三分之一。我国长江流域以南的广大地区都可以栽种。我国人民根据自然条件，创造了各种特有的栽培方法，不论在山上、丘陵、平原或水田里，都可以栽种。在北方某些气候较寒冷的地区，也在试验种植某些耐寒品种的柑桔。
    我国柑桔不仅栽培历史悠久，而且品种丰富多彩。主要可分为橙、柑、桔、柚、金柑、柠檬等类。
    橙子：果子圆形，个较大，吃起来甜酸适度，营养价值高。四川湖南一带叫它广柑。福建的雪柑，广东的新会橙，四川江津的鹅蛋柑都是最好的橙子。
    桔子：果形较小，皮松容易剥，吃起来很方便，栽培范围较广，产量也较多。著名的品种有浙江本地早桔，福建的福桔，江西南丰蜜桔等。
    柑子：是介于橙和桔间的一个种类，耐寒性较强；果子较大，近圆形，皮也较厚但松而容易剥。最好的品种有广东、福建的蕉柑、椪柑（又叫汕头蜜桔），湖南、浙江的温州蜜柑等。
    柚子：是柑桔类中最大的一种，大的有好几斤重，浅黄色，在国内市场上很畅销。
    柠檬：味香而酸，主要用以切片泡柠檬茶，在国内食用的很少，在国际市场上极受欢迎。此外，还有个儿很小的金柑，供观赏用的佛手，和熏茶叶用的代代等也都是柑桔类的果树。
    柑桔的营养价值在一般水果中是上等品。它又是主要的出口果品之一，经济价值很高，出口一吨柑桔，可换回两吨钢材或四吨汽油。桔皮、桔络、桔核又是中药材。柑桔树四季长青，花香果美，因此，它又是美化自然和装饰庭院的一种很好的林木。解放后我国柑桔的栽培有很大发展，1958年全国栽培面积约达一百四十余万亩，总产量约八百万担左右。但现有数量还不能满足人民生活和出口外销的需要，柑桔树还应该大量发展。（附图片）
