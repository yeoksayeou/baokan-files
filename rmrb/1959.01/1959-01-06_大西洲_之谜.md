The Mystery of "Atlantis"
Shì Gōng

More than two thousand three hundred years ago, the ancient Greek scholar Plato described a mysterious continent. This continent was said to be in the Atlantic Ocean west of Europe, and was called "Atlantis." There, there was once a wealthy and powerful country, whose expeditionary forces had reached the area of North Africa, but in "an unfortunate night," this continent mysteriously disappeared into the sea.

For centuries, many people have been exploring this "mystery." The People's Daily once reported that Soviet scientist Liedov, based on twenty years of research, revealed the secret. He believes that there was indeed a large island hundreds of kilometers long and several small islands that sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. He even determined that the sinking time was around the fifteenth century BC, and 60 million residents on the island were destroyed.

The large-scale subsidence of certain parts of the Earth's crust is still a fact today. For example, the land of the Netherlands is sinking, so the threat of seawater flooding the country constantly exists, and people have to spend great efforts to fight against the seawater.

While large areas of land are sinking, other parts of the Earth are rising. A hundred years ago, Finnish sailors and fishermen found seashells that grow in the ocean high on the coast of the Baltic Sea. At that time, they speculated that the former sea level had been here, and it must be that the terrain here had risen and the sea had receded. So they made some marks on the cliffs along the sea level at that time. A hundred years later, when their descendants went to look for these marks, they found that they were two meters above the sea level. Therefore, it is very likely that the Baltic Sea will become land after many years. The relics of the ancient coast were also found at Qīxīnggǎng, thirteen miles southeast of Guangzhou in our country, and there are signs of crustal uplift in many places in Guangdong.

Crustal uplift leaves traces not only on the coast but also on the riverbank. When the continent rises, the sea level relatively drops, and the rivers are precisely to erode those parts that are higher than the sea level, so they become greatly active and excavate new riverbeds to the depths. The original riverbeds, because of the uplift, become flat riverbanks. After multiple uplifts, step-like platforms will appear on both sides of the river. In the middle of the seventeenth century, people in our country discovered this phenomenon. It is recorded in a book called "Guǎngyáng Zá Jì" that the place that used to be Diàoyútái had run to the mountainside, more than two miles away from the river bank.

The cause of large-scale uplift and subsidence of the Earth's crust is due to the pressure it receives in the direction perpendicular to the Earth's crust. In the past, people called this movement land-making movement, but this does not cover all of its activities, so now it is mostly called oscillatory movement.

Oscillatory movement and orogenic movement are not mutually exclusive, but are often closely combined. Therefore, the situation of the rocks we see in the field is very complicated, and it is necessary to do a lot of investigation to clarify the relationship between them, which is the so-called geological structure. As for the sinking of "Atlantis," the reasons may be more complicated. Although there was a large area of land sinking there, it is said that there was intense volcanic activity and earthquakes, so it is obviously not possible to explain it with oscillatory movement. There are many secrets waiting for us to explore inside the Earth!

    “大西洲”之谜
    石工
    距今两千三百多年以前，古希腊的学者柏拉图曾经描述过一个神秘的大陆。这个大陆据说在欧洲西边的大西洋中，被称作“大西洲”。在那里曾有一个富强的国家，她的远征军到过北非一带，但是在“一个不幸的夜里”，这个大陆神秘地消失到海里去了。
    多少世纪以来，许多人都在探索这个“谜”。人民日报曾经报道苏联科学家列德?夫根据二十年来研究的结果，揭开了谜底。他认为确实有过这么一个长达数百公里的大岛和若干小岛沉没在大西洋底了。他甚至测定沉没的时间是在公元前十五世纪左右，岛上六千万居民遭到了毁灭。
    地壳的某些部分大面积地向下沉降是今天还有的事实。比如荷兰的土地就正在下沉，因此海水淹没这个国家的威胁经常存在，人们不得不花费很大的力量来和海水斗争。
    在大片土地下沉的同时，地球上另一些地方却正在上升。一百年前芬兰的水手和渔夫在波罗的海的海岸高处找到了海洋中生长的贝壳，当时他们就推测从前的海面到过这里，一定是这里的地势升高，海水退去了。于是他们沿着当时的海面在崖壁上做了一些记号，一百年后当他们的子孙去找寻这些记号时，发现它们已高出海面两公尺。因此很可能在经过许多年以后波罗的海将变为陆地。我国广州东南十三里的七星岗也发现了古海岸的遗迹，广东许多地方都有地壳上升的迹象。
    地壳上升不仅在海岸上留下痕迹，在河岸上也留下痕迹。当大陆上升的时候，海平面相对地下降，河流正是要侵蚀掉那些比海平面高的部分，因此大大活跃起来，向深处开凿新的河床。原来的河床则因为升高，成为平坦的河岸。在经过多次上升以后，河的两岸就会出现一个个阶梯似的平台。十七世纪中我国就有人发现了这种现象。在一本叫做“广阳杂记”的书中就记述了曾经是钓鱼台的地方跑到了半山上，距离江岸已有二里多远了。
    造成地壳大面积升降的原因，是由于它受到了垂直地壳方向的压力。从前有人把这种运动叫做造陆运动，但是这概括不了它的全部活动，因此现在多叫它震荡运动。
    震荡运动和造山运动不是“河水不犯井水”，而是常常密切结合的。因此在野外我们所看到的岩石的情况就很错综复杂，需要作好些调查，才能弄清它们间的关系，也就是所谓的地质构造。至于“大西洲”的沉没，原因可能更复杂了。虽然那里是大片陆地下沉，但是据说有过剧烈的火山活动和地震，因此显然是不能用震荡运动来解释的，在地球的内部等待我们探索的秘密可多着哩！
