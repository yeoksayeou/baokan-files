Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 19th: The 1959 National Eleven-Unit Ice Hockey Tournament concluded on the 18th after seven and a half days of competition. The ice hockey teams from Harbin, Beijing, Jilin, Qiqihar, Changchun, and Mudanjiang secured the top six positions in the competition. The following rankings are: Shenyang Team, Shenyang Military Region Air Force Team, Tianjin Team, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Team, and Jiamusi Team.

During this tournament, each team became more courageous as they fought, and the battle situation was difficult to predict. Originally, the Qiqihar team defeated the Jilin team, and the Beijing team defeated the Qiqihar team. In the end, the Jilin team defeated the Beijing team again.

The Harbin team maintained an undefeated record throughout this competition. They had a net score of sixty-five goals and only conceded three. In a match against the runner-up Beijing team, they won with a score of five to one. From the start, the Harbin team adopted a small triangle passing strategy, pressing into the Beijing team's defensive zone and playing at a fast tempo. The first period ended with a score of three to zero. In the second period, the Beijing team recognized their tactics and cut off the opponent's offensive line on the side of the goal. The Harbin team then changed tactics, using long passes to spread out the play. However, the Beijing team broke through the defensive line and put pressure on the defensive zone. In this match, the Harbin team ultimately won with a score of five to one. Although the Jilin team was defeated by the Qiqihar team in the group stage, they learned from their experiences and lessons in the final stage. As a result, they successively defeated Changchun and Mudanjiang, and finally defeated the Beijing team with a score of five to two. (Photo attached)

    十一单位冰球对抗赛结束
    哈尔滨北京分获冠亚军
    新华社哈尔滨19日电　1959年全国十一单位冰球对抗赛经过七天半的比赛，已经在18日结束。哈尔滨、北京、吉林、齐齐哈尔、长春和牡丹江的冰球队获得了这次比赛的前六名，以下的名次是：沈阳队、沈阳地区部队空军队、天津队、延边朝鲜族自治州队和佳木斯队。
    这次对抗赛中，各队越战越勇猛，战况变化很难预测。原来齐齐哈尔队胜吉林队，北京队打败了齐齐哈尔队。最后，吉林队又赢了北京队。
    哈尔滨队在这次比赛中一直保持不败的纪录。他们净胜六十五球，只被攻进三球。他们对亚军北京队的一场比赛中，以五比一获胜。哈尔滨队一开始就采用了小三角传球，压进北京队守区门前，大打快板，第一局打成三比零。第二局北京队看出门路，切断对方在门侧的进攻线，哈尔滨队随即改变战术，长传球，拉开打，但又被北京队突破卫线，紧逼守区。这场比赛，最后五比一哈尔滨队告捷。吉林队虽然在小组循环赛中被齐齐哈尔队打败，但在决赛阶段中吸取了经验教训，因此先后战胜了长春、牡丹江，最后并以五比二的成绩战胜了北京队。（附图片）
