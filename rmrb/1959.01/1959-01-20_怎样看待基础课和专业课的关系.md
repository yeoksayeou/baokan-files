How to View the Relationship Between Basic Courses and Specialized Courses
Zhou Nan

In the teaching reform of higher industrial colleges, what is the relationship between basic courses and specialized courses? How should we correctly view the relationship between basic courses and specialized courses?

In the past, there was a phenomenon in the teaching of basic courses that they were divorced from the specialized fields and from reality, simply emphasizing their own systematicness, and not teaching or rarely teaching the new achievements in modern science and technology. In fact, in these basic courses, in addition to some that have been fully proven to be correct and useful, there are also many cumbersome, disjointed, and missing parts. Moreover, because some teachers are divorced from reality and from their specializations, the teaching of basic courses is often just dry logical reasoning, and some even deliberately mystify things. Teaching basic courses in this way often only leads students into a "maze."

Theory must be combined with practice in order to improve theory, develop theory, and further guide practice forward. Basic courses are courses of basic theoretical knowledge that students must study, but they need to be combined with specializations and with practice so that students can master their specialized knowledge on a broad theoretical foundation and further improve the teaching quality of basic theoretical courses. Therefore, the teaching content of basic courses should be adjusted in accordance with the principles of combining specializations and combining practice. In the process of reforming basic courses, many universities have added some new achievements in science and technology and increased the parts needed by the specializations; they have streamlined redundant content and streamlined those cumbersome, outdated, and even erroneous things. It should be said that this is appropriate. On this basis, a new basic theoretical course system can be established that can both be combined with specializations, reflect the new achievements in science and technology, serve the current needs, and serve the future development of science and technology, becoming basic theoretical courses worthy of the name.

The combination of theory and practice enriches, enlivens, improves, and makes theory vibrant. Some people believe that the combination of basic courses and specializations will reduce theory or weaken theory, and hinder the systematicness of theory, which is an overestimation. Theory is something that comes from practice and has been proven by practice. Things that cannot stand the test of practice are not true basic knowledge, nor are they true theories. The combination of basic courses and specializations can test the correctness of theory, liberate basic courses themselves from the shackles of theory-theory-theory, and become truly living knowledge, which will be firmly grasped by students. After the combination of basic courses and specializations, not only will the content of basic courses not be reduced, but it will be taught better and more thoroughly than what is stipulated in the teaching syllabus in the past, enriching the current basic theoretical teaching, and will enable basic courses to obtain an infinite source of inspiration, continuously improve, and establish a new theoretical system.

Theory must be combined with practice. Theory that is divorced from the practical needs of specializations is empty and one-sided at the same time. However, we are not empiricists. We not only do not neglect, but on the contrary, we must pay great attention to basic theory. Basic courses clarify the general laws of objective things, which can enable students to learn broad basic theoretical knowledge and enable students to learn to use scientific methods. Basic theory is of great benefit to students' understanding of their specializations, enabling them to develop their specialized knowledge and engage in creative learning on a broad theoretical foundation. However, some people think that the connection of basic courses with practice means "teaching whatever is needed," and even advocate merging, dismantling, or canceling basic courses. This view is also one-sided. If this is done, it will greatly weaken theoretical teaching and also affect specialized teaching, so that students can only obtain fragmentary knowledge and cannot obtain systematic knowledge. For example, physics should not only teach some physics knowledge currently needed by the specialized courses, but also enable students to have a more comprehensive and unified understanding of the material world through teaching. For example, to teach atomic physics, there must first be a foundation of molecular physics, light, and electricity. Natural laws have their own internal connections. Cutting off this connection will not allow students to master natural laws well and learn systematic knowledge.

Of course, practice is the source of theory, and students can gradually learn, improve, and develop theory in specialized practice. It is wrong to ignore this aspect. However, practice is not equal to theory, just as iron ore is not equal to steel. Practice still needs to be summarized and elevated in order to become theory, otherwise it is narrow experience. It is also wrong to ignore this aspect. Basic theory is the summary of thousands of years of direct experience of predecessors. It is impossible for each of us to have so much direct experience, nor is it necessary. We should well accept some useful experiences of our predecessors and inherit the valuable historical heritage.

Basic courses and specialized courses should be closely combined. Basic courses should be combined with the current needs of the specializations. It is not feasible to be divorced from reality. However, it should not be required with a short-sighted view, and the standard of whether it can be applied currently cannot be used as a standard for selection. Some theories may not be used today, but they may be used tomorrow; this course may not be used, but that course may be used. Therefore, in the reform of basic courses, today should be combined with tomorrow, and current needs should be combined with long-term needs.

    怎样看待基础课和专业课的关系
    周南
    高等工业院校的教学改革中，基础课和专业课的关系如何？怎样正确看待基础课和专业课的关系呢？
    过去，基础课的教学中，有脱离专业、脱离实际的现象，单纯强调本身的系统性，不教或很少讲授近代科学技术上的新成就。其实，在这些基础课中，除了一部分已经被充分证明是正确的、有用的以外，也有不少繁琐、脱节和遗漏的地方。又由于一些教师脱离实际，脱离专业，在基础课的讲述中，常常只是枯燥的逻辑推理，有人甚至故弄玄虚。这样来教基础课，往往只会把学生引入“迷宫”。
    理论必须结合实际，才能提高理论，发展理论，从而进一步指导实际前进。基础课是学生必读的基本理论知识的课程，但是，它需要结合专业，结合实际，才能使学生在广泛的理论基础上攻通他们的专业知识，并且进一步提高基础理论课的教学质量。所以，在结合专业、结合实际的原则下，对于基础课的教学内容，要加以调整。许多高等学校在改革基础课的过程中，增加了一些科学技术新成就的内容，增加了专业所需要的部分；精减了重复的内容，精减了那些繁琐的、过时的，甚至是错误的东西。应该说，这样做是适当的。在这样的基础上，就可以建立起既能结合专业，反映科学技术新成就的新的基础理论课体系，使它服务于当前的需要，又服务于未来的科学技术的发展，成为名副其实的基础理论课。
    理论和实际结合，使理论丰富了，生动了，提高了，变得生气勃勃。有人认为，基础课和专业结合，会降低理论或削弱理论，妨碍理论的系统性，那是一种过虑。理论是从实践中产生出来，而又被实践所证明了的东西。在实践中经不起考验的东西，就不是真正的基础知识，也不是真正的理论。基础课结合专业，可以检验理论的正确性，使基础课本身从理论——理论——理论的桎梏中解放出来，成为真正的活的知识，而为学生所牢固地掌握。基础课结合专业以后，不仅不会减少基础课的内容，而且会比过去教学大纲中所规定的讲得更好更透，丰富了当前的基础理论教学，并且将使基础课获得无穷源泉，不断提高，建立新的理论系统。
    理论必须与实际相结合，脱离专业实际的理论是空洞的，同时也是片面的。但是，我们不是经验主义者，我们不仅不忽视，相反地，我们要十分重视基础理论。基础课阐明客观事物的一般规律，可以使学生学到广阔的基础理论知识，使学生学会运用科学的方法。基础理论对学生理解专业有很大好处，可以使他们在广泛的理论基础上发展他们的专业知识，进行创造性的学习。可是，有的人认为，基础课联系实际，就是“要什么，讲什么”，甚至于主张把基础课合并、拆散或取消。这种看法也是片面的。如果这样做，就会大大削弱理论教学，同时也影响到专业教学，使学生只能得到片断的知识，不能得到系统的知识。比如物理，不仅要讲专业课目前所需要的一些物理知识，而且要通过教学使学生对物质世界有个较全面的统一的了解。又如要讲原子物理，就得先有分子物理、光、电的基础。自然规律都有它们自己的内在联系。割断这种联系，就不能很好地让学生掌握自然规律，学到系统的知识。
    当然，实践是理论的源泉，学生在专业实践中也可以逐步学习、提高和发展理论，忽视这个方面是错误的。但是，实践并不等于理论，正如铁矿石不等于钢一样。实践还有待于概括、上升，才能成为理论，不然就是狭隘的经验了。忽视了这个方面，同样也是错误的。基础理论是前人几千年的直接经验的总结，我们每个人不可能有这么多的直接经验，而且也不必要。我们应该很好地接受前人的一些有用的经验，承继宝贵的历史遗产。
    基础课和专业课应该密切结合。基础课应当结合专业的目前需要，脱离实际是不行的。但是又不应该以近视的眼光去要求，不能只拿当前能不能适用作为取舍的标准。有些理论今天用不上，明天就可以用得上；这一门课用不上，那一门课就可以用得上。所以，在基础课的改革中，应当把今天同明天结合起来，把当前需要和长远需要结合起来。
