Small Sparks in the Great Leap Forward

Multi-Purpose Stove for Cooking, Steaming, Heating, and Power Generation
Anshan Restaurant Creates "All-Purpose Stove"
The workers of the state-owned Anshan Restaurant have built an "all-purpose steam-powered generating stove" that can steam rice, cook dishes, heat, and generate electricity.

The stove's structure is simple. Inside the furnace chamber, several loops of heating pipes are placed, connected at one end to a steam generator. The pipes absorb heat from the furnace, using the principle of heat circulation to produce steam. The stove built by the Anshan Restaurant produces steam that can drive a ten-horsepower steam engine, which in turn drives a 7.5 kW motor, generating 7,500 kWh of electricity.

The stove has many benefits. Since the Anshan Restaurant started using it, in addition to generating enough electricity for its own use, it can save more than 1,600 tons of coal per year. Cooking and steaming are also faster, which enables cooks to improve their work efficiency and reduce customers' waiting time. At the same time, the steam can be used for heating and to heat bath water, as well as to disinfect tableware, towels, and other items.

New Contributions from *Anemone cathayensis*
Hongguang Commune Manufactures New Pesticide
The pesticide factory of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pi County, Sichuan Province, has used *Anemone cathayensis* to create an effective pesticide for treating sclerotinia of rapeseed. This pesticide is simple to make and low in cost. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture held a provincial on-site meeting in the commune on the 16th, preparing to promote it widely in various regions.

Sclerotinia of rapeseed is a destructive disease. Rapeseed infected with this fungus will wither and die within a few days if not treated promptly. The Chengdu Plain is the main rapeseed-producing area of Sichuan Province. In the past, the only way for farmers to deal with rapeseed infected with sclerotinia was to spray with Ceresan, but its stability was not great, and as the rapeseed planting area expanded, the demand for drugs also increased. Last year, the Hongguang People's Commune saw that *Anemone cathayensis* was very effective in killing mosquitoes and flies, so they decided to use it to test the treatment of rapeseed sclerotinia. With the help of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture, after a month of experimentation, they finally succeeded. They sprayed the prepared drug on rapeseed with sclerotinia, and achieved success in ten consecutive indoor tests. Recently, they also achieved the same effect in outdoor large-area rapeseed field trials. The rapeseed sprayed with the drug had all the fungi eliminated, and the growth of the crops was not affected.

The method of making "*Anemone cathayensis*" fungicide is very simple. Just mash the flowers, add four catties of water per catty, soak for three days and nights, stirring two or three times in the middle, then take out and squeeze and filter, take the liquid juice, add 2% ferrous ammonium sulfate (green vitriol) to make it.

Currently, in addition to using it to manufacture large quantities of fungicide, the Hongguang People's Commune is also further developing agents to kill aphids, cabbage worms, and to treat mange in pigs and cattle.

New Record for Artificial Insemination of Sheep Appears on the Hulunbuir Grassland
The Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has recently seen successive records of high efficiency in artificial insemination for sheep improvement, providing favorable conditions for the high-speed development of animal husbandry production.

The Ulan Modu Pastoral People's Commune in the Front Banner of Horqin Right Wing established a sheep improvement artificial insemination network, including sixteen breeding stations, between November and December last year. They used the semen of five Caucasian Merino rams to inseminate 18,000 Mongolian ewes, completing all insemination work in one and a half months, with an average ewe pregnancy rate reaching 95%. The commune also used the semen of one excellent ram to inseminate 11,199 ewes, with a pregnancy rate also reaching about 95%.

Prior to this, Mongolian commune members and technical cadres of the Wangong Sumu People's Commune in Chen Barag Banner had successfully used the semen of one ram to inseminate 10,765 ewes, with a pregnancy rate reaching over 90%.

The facts of successful artificial insemination and high-rate breeding in these two pastoral communes have broken the original view that "animal husbandry cannot leap forward as rapidly as industrial and agricultural production" and "artificial insemination does not guarantee pregnancy."

Lhasa's First Indigenous Blast Furnace
Lhasa's first indigenous blast furnace has already smelted pig iron from local ore. This indigenous blast furnace produces one and a half tons of pig iron per day. It was built by the workers of the Lhasa Motor Vehicle Team of the Transportation Department of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Administration.

Lhasa did not have a iron smelting furnace in the past, and all the iron tools needed here had been supplied from other places. Last year, organs and troops in Lhasa warmly responded to the Party's call to vigorously develop iron and steel, and used scrap iron to make steel and iron. Now, smelting pig iron from local ore is a first here.

Recently, organs and troops in Lhasa held an on-site meeting next to this indigenous blast furnace to exchange experiences on furnace construction, batching, ventilation, and other aspects of indigenous iron smelting.

According to the arrangements of the Finance and Economics Committee of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, a number of indigenous blast furnaces will be built in the Lhasa area this year. The holding of this on-site meeting will further promote this year's iron smelting production.

Making New Medicines from By-Products
The workers of the Zhenjiang Pharmaceutical Factory in Jiangsu Province, carrying forward the spirit of practical, hard, and ingenious work, overcame the difficulties of lacking technical data and equipment, made a set of indigenous equipment by themselves, and extracted eight kinds of medicines from the brains, bile, and bones of pigs, cattle, and sheep using indigenous methods. Now, they are continuing to find ways to further use the by-products of pigs, cattle, and sheep to manufacture new medicines.

The eight kinds of medicines successfully trial-produced by the Zhenjiang Pharmaceutical Factory are all relatively valuable. For example, cholesterol extracted from the brains of pigs, cattle, and sheep is the raw material for manufacturing vitamin D; using cholesterol and cholic acid and bilirubin extracted from the bile of pigs, cattle, and sheep to synthesize, making precious Chinese medicine bezoar; Baike Ning made from bile is a good medicine for treating pertussis in children.

Good Coalfield Discovered in the Gobi Desert
A prospecting team from the Xinjiang Geological Bureau recently discovered a coalfield in the eastern Gobi Desert of Hami, Xinjiang.

This coalfield has more than fifty coal seams, the thickest of which is fourteen meters. The coal outcrops are five kilometers long. According to the scope of the outcrops, the reserves reach 120 million tons, and the coal quality is good and can be coked.

The discovery of this coalfield will help solve the coal problem for the development of the steel industry in the Hami area. (Attached picture)

    大跃进中的小火花
    作菜蒸饭取暖发电
    鞍山饭店制成万能灶
    国营鞍山饭店职工建造了一座既能蒸饭、作菜又能取暖、发电的“万能蒸汽发电灶”。
    这种炉灶的构造很简单，在炉灶的炉膛内，设置数圈加热排管，另一端连接着蒸汽发生炉，通过排管吸收炉膛里的热量，利用热循环的原理产生蒸汽。鞍山饭店建成的这个炉灶产生的蒸汽，能带动十马力的蒸汽机，蒸汽机再带动七点五瓩的电动机，可发出七千五百度的电力。
    使用这种灶的好处很多。鞍山饭店使用以后，除发出的电力够本店使用以外，一年内还可以节省煤炭一千六百多吨；烧菜烧饭也很快，可使炊事人员提高工作效率，减少顾客等候的时间；同时，还可以利用蒸汽采暖和供浴池加热、供食具、毛巾等物消毒用。
  打破碗花花的新贡献
  红光公社制造新农药
    四川省郫县红光人民公社农药厂，用“打破碗花花”，制成治疗油菜菌核病的有效农药。这种农药制法简单，成本低。四川省农业厅16日在该社召开全省现场会议，准备在各地普遍推广。
    油菜菌核病是一种毁灭性的病害，油菜感染到这种病菌，如不及时处理，几天便枯萎而死。成都平原是四川省油菜主要产地，以往农民遇到油菜感染菌核病，唯一的办法是用赛力散淋喷，但稳定性不大，而且随着油菜播种面积扩大，对药物的需要量也日益增大。去年，红光人民公社看到“打破碗花花”对杀灭蚊蝇有很大效力，就决定用它来试验治疗油菜菌核病。他们在四川省农业厅的帮助下，经过一个月的试验，终于成功。他们把制成的药剂喷在带有菌核病的油菜上，连续十次室内试验都获得成功。最近他们在室外大面积油菜田试验，也获得同样的效果，淋洒药剂的油菜，病菌全部消灭，而且作物生长不受影响。
      “打破碗花花”杀菌剂的作法十分简单。只要把花捣烂，每斤加水四斤，浸泡三昼夜，中间搅动二、三次，然后取出压榨、过滤，取其液汁，加2％的硫酸錏铁（青矾）即成。
    目前，红光人民公社除了用它制造大量的杀菌剂外，还进一步制成灭杀蚜虫、青菜虫和治疗猪、牛癞疥病的药剂。
  呼伦贝尔草原出现
  绵羊人工受胎新纪录
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上，最近接连出现绵羊改良人工授精高效率的纪录，为高速度发展畜牧业生产提供了良好条件。
    科尔沁右翼前旗乌兰毛都牧区人民公社，去年11月、12月间建立了包括十六个配种站的绵羊改良人工输精网，用五只高加索美利奴种公羊的精液给一万八千只蒙古母羊配种，一个半月内就完成全部配种工作，母羊受胎率平均达到95％。这个公社还采用一只优良种公羊的精液，给一万一千一百九十九只母羊输精，受胎率也达到95％左右。
    在此以前，陈巴尔虎旗完工苏木人民公社的蒙古族社员和技术干部，曾用一只种公羊的精液给一万零七百六十五只母羊输精成功，受胎率达到90％以上。
    这两个牧区公社的人工授精和高额配种成功的事实，打破了原来有人认为“畜牧业不能像工农业生产那样迅速跃进”、“人工授精不保胎”等的看法。
  拉萨的第一座土高炉
    拉萨一座土高炉已经用本地矿石炼出了生铁。这座土高炉每天产一吨半生铁。它是青藏公路交通运输管理局运输处拉萨汽车一队职工们修建的。
    拉萨在过去没有一座炼铁炉，这里需要的一切铁质器具一直都靠外地供给。去年拉萨的机关、部队，热烈响应党的大办钢铁的号召，曾利用废铁炼钢炼铁。现在用本地矿石炼出生铁，在这里还是第一次。
    拉萨市机关、部队最近在这座土高炉旁召开了现场会议，交流了土法炼铁的有关建炉、配料、通风等经验。
    根据中共西藏工委财经委员会的安排，今年，拉萨地区将兴建一批土高炉，这次现场会议的召开将进一步促进今年的炼铁生产。
    用副产物制新药品
    江苏省镇江市制药厂职工发扬实干苦干巧干精神，克服没有技术资料和设备的困难，自制一套土设备，用土法从猪、牛、羊的大脑、胆汁和骨头里，提炼出八种药品。现在，他们正在继续想办法，进一步利用猪、牛、羊身上的副产物来制造新的药品。
    镇江市制药厂试制成功的八种药品都是比较贵重的。如从猪、牛、羊的大脑中提取出来的胆固醇，是制造维生素丁的原料；用胆固醇与从猪、牛、羊的胆汁中提取出来的胆酸、胆红素合成，制成名贵的中药牛黄；用胆汁制成的百咳宁，是治疗小儿百日咳的良药。
  戈壁滩上发现好煤田
    新疆地质局的一支勘探队，最近在新疆哈密东部戈壁滩上发现了一个煤田。
    这个煤田共有煤层五十多层，最厚的煤层有十四公尺。煤矿露头有五公里长，根据露头范围计算，储量达一亿两千万吨，煤质良好，可以炼焦。
    这个煤田的发现，有助于解决哈密地区发展钢铁工业的用煤问题。（附图片）
