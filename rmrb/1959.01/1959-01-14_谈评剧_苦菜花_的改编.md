    On the Adaptation of the Ping Opera "Bitter Vegetable Flowers"
    Comrade Xiao Jia and Comrade Xue Enhou:
    I have seen the "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" performed by the China Ping Opera Theater, which you and Comrade Gao Chen adapted. I would like to share my thoughts with you.
    I have read the novel "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" and I like it very much. I was especially excited to see it adapted for the stage. The adaptation strives to extract the most acute points of conflict in the novel and to consider the profound implications of the novel's focus on the character of the mother. This is enough to see the adapter's painstaking efforts.
    Adapting this novel is not easy. I think the difficulty lies in the fact that the novel uses the mother as the main thread, symbolizing the suffering motherland – that is, the bitter root of the bitter vegetable. The mother's life is glorious and splendid, and her children, relatives, friends, and comrades who share her destiny, as well as the mother herself, are the beautiful flowers that spring from the bitter root – that is, the bitter vegetable flowers. However, when adapting it into a play, anyone's first thought is to consider using the elimination of the traitor Wang Jianzhi as the main line of the story. Because this line has sharp contradictions and clear distinctions between the enemy and ourselves. This creates two possibilities for adapting the play: one is to focus on the mother, like the novel, and express the mother in many ways. From the time she came out of feudal society without a conscious class awareness, to how she treated her children later, her relationship with the People's Liberation Army, how she treated the enemies who were openly violent, how she treated the hidden enemy agents, how she treated the mistakes of the cadres' work style, how she cared for the poor farmers, how she became the core of the masses, and her relationship with the Party... writing about the mother's changes and developments in the revolutionary process. Writing in this way might result in a "biography of the mother." Biographical plays are very difficult to write, and it is easy to scatter other characters, make the story difficult to concentrate, and make the dramatic contradictions not sharp enough. Writing in this way will also lose the rich dramatic plots provided by the original novel, turning many characters in the original novel into flat shadows. The above are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of adaptation.
    Another possibility is to tightly grasp the theme of anti-espionage struggle in the base area, that is, to use the struggle against the traitor Wang Jianzhi as the main line. This line is extremely clear and complete in the novel. This line is sharp, thrilling, and tense. In this way, only the first half of the novel is used. When reading the novel, I felt that after Wang Jianzhi was publicly tried, I could no longer muster the same eagerness to get to the bottom of things. Although this is my preference for reading stories, it also proves that the first and second halves of the novel are not well connected. The first half has a very strong narrative, and the descriptions of the characters' mental outlook and psychological state, as well as the arrangement of the typical environment, are exceptionally close, profound, and concentrated, placing the specific figures of opposing contradictions in front of the reader for analysis, making people overwhelmed. The second half spreads out, and in addition to the mother developing along her own thoughts and character, the opposing contradictions are no longer specific figures who are consistently connected, and the arrangement of the environment and events is not as concentrated as in the first half. The above is a feeling about the novel caused by adapting it into a play.
    Having said that, if the play is adapted according to this anti-espionage struggle line, the play will be very attractive, but it will inevitably weaken the performance of the mother, thus affecting the profound meaning of the proposition of "Bitter Vegetable Flowers." Not only that, but when writing this line, special attention must be paid not to weaken the portrayal of the positive characters. I feel that in the novel, if the positive characters such as Jiang Yongquan, Juanzi, Desong, and Yuqiu are compared with the negative character Wang Jianzhi, the latter is described more centrally in the novel, while the description of the former is not full enough in comparison. More importantly, the descriptions of the positive characters' contributions in the struggle are too few and too thin. During the Anti-Japanese War, these local cadres made contributions in various aspects, which were reflected in the improvement of the ideological awareness and struggle art of the masses – including the cadres themselves. However, the novel does not adequately describe the ideological development, personal growth, and contributions to the base area of people like Jiang Yongquan, Juanzi, and Feng Desong, and they are not active enough in the struggle against Wang Jianzhi. This is what we feel dissatisfied with in the novel when we study the adaptation of the play. Therefore, the adaptation of the play should focus on supplementing this aspect.
    The adaptation of the Ping opera "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" is an achievement, and some scenes are very dramatic. However, it also lacks concentration, and it fails to express the theme and story in a concentrated and powerful way. This is a difficult problem. Adapting a novel of hundreds of thousands of words and recreating it into a work of art is certainly not an easy task that can be accomplished overnight. It seems that when encountering this situation, the playwrights have to pick up their knives and scissors and perform major surgery on the novel.
    I must declare again that the above-mentioned feelings about the novel are based on the adaptation into a play. I cannot make any arbitrary judgments on the novel itself. Novels can be written freely and smoothly with hundreds of thousands of words, but each play can only be about three hours long, about 40,000 words. What to do? Plays can only be short and sharp compared to long novels.
    The Ping opera "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" has been performed for a long time, but the effect of the performance is still strong. The audience cares about the fate of many positive characters headed by the mother, and hates the ugly faces of the negative characters headed by Wang Jianzhi. The sounds of sighs, surprise, mockery, and laughter in the theater are endless, which shows that it is a good play. The plot is still tense, and the portrayals of the mother and Wang Jianzhi are also distinct. This play has great potential and should be continuously improved.
    I feel that the Ping Opera Theater has a strong momentum, and the fact that it has staged many new plays is proof of this. This time, I brought back novel creations from the front line in Fujian. I really like watching the performance of "Sanliwan," and many comrades also gave good reviews to "The Girl Who Likes to Braid Her Hair." I feel that the Ping Opera Theater is clear on the policy of serving politics, and in the creation of Ping opera art, it is both bold and has many gratifying successes.
    I wish you continued efforts!

### 谈评剧“苦菜花”的改编

    谈评剧“苦菜花”的改编
    萧甲薛恩厚同志：
    中国评剧院演出的你同高琛同志改编的“苦菜花”我看过了。我想和你说说我的感想。
    “苦菜花”小说我看过，很喜欢。看到它搬上舞台，尤为兴奋。改编时，尽量撷取小说中矛盾尖锐之处，尽量考虑到小说中对母亲这一人物着意刻划的深刻含意。这足以窥见改编者的苦心。
    改编这部小说是不容易的。我以为难处在于：小说是以母亲作主线，象征苦难的祖国——即苦菜之苦根。母亲的一生，是光辉灿烂的，和她一起共命运的儿女、亲人、朋友、同志，以及母亲本人，又是苦根所生发出的美丽的花朵——即苦菜花。而改编戏，任谁第一眼都不得不考虑以除灭汉奸王柬之为故事主线。因为这条线，矛盾尖锐，敌我分明。这就构成改编戏时的两种可能：一是以围绕母亲为中心，像小说一样，多方面地表现母亲。从封建社会走过来的没有自为的阶级意识时起，到以后她怎样对待儿女，她对解放军的关系，她如何对待明火执杖的敌人，如何对待暗藏的敌特，如何对待干部的错误作风，怎样对贫苦农民的关怀，怎样成为群众的核心，她和党的关系……，写母亲在革命进程中的变化发展。这样写，就可能写成一个“母亲传”。传记体的戏很不好写，容易使其它人物分散，故事不易集中，戏剧矛盾不尖锐。这样写，还会失去原小说中所提供的丰富的戏剧情节，使原小说中许许多多人物变为扁平的影子。以上是这一种改法的利和弊。
    另一种可能，紧紧抓住以根据地反特斗争为主题，也就是以对汉奸敌特王柬之的斗争为主线。这一条线，在小说中极为鲜明完整。这条线斗争尖锐、惊险、紧张。这样就只用小说的前半部。在看小说时，我觉得看到王柬之被公审后，就再也提不起原来那股子急于寻根究底的劲头了。这虽是我有看故事的偏爱，但也反证了小说中前后两半不够衔接。前半部故事性很强烈，人物精神面貌、心理状态的描写和典型环境的铺排都异常紧密深刻而集中，把对立矛盾的具体人物摆在读者面前剖析，使人们目不暇给。后半部则铺撒开来，除母亲沿着自己的思想性格有所发展外，矛盾对立面已不是具体人物贯串如一，环境、事件的安排也不似前半部集中。以上所谈是为了改戏所引起的对小说的感触。
    话说回来，按照这反特斗争的线索改下来，戏会是很吸引人的，但势必削弱母亲的表现，因之也就影响了“苦菜花”这一命题的深刻寓意。不仅如此，写这一条线，还要特别注意不要减弱正面人物的刻划。我感到在小说中，如果以姜永泉、娟子、德松、玉秋等正面人物与反面人物王柬之相比，后者在小说中描写得比较集中，而对前者的描写，比较起来就不够丰满。更重要的还由于描写正面人物在斗争中建树的地方太少太薄。在抗日时期对敌斗争中，这些地方干部有各方面的建树，它又会表现在群众——包括干部本人——思想觉悟、斗争艺术的提高上。而小说中像姜永泉、娟子、冯德松等人，思想的发展，本身的成长，对根据地的建树都描写得不够，就是在对王柬之的斗争上也显得不够主动。这是我们研究改编戏的时候，对小说感到不满足的。因之改编戏时就要着意补足这方面。
    评剧“苦菜花”的改编是有成就的，有些场子戏剧性很强。但是也就失之于松散，在主题、故事方面都没能集中有力地表现。这是一个难题，改编几十万字的小说，把它再创造为一件艺术品，当然不是轻而易举，一蹴即就的事。看来，碰到这种情况时，那是要写戏的人操起刀剪，给小说动大手术的。
    我当再次申明，上面所谈对小说的感触，那是基于为了改编成戏而引起的。对小说本身，我不能妄加评断。小说可以用几十万字畅泄直流地写下去，可是，每个戏只能是三小时左右，四万字上下。奈何？戏比起长篇小说来，只能是刀短刃利。
    评戏“苦菜花”演出了很久，但到现在，演出的效果依然强烈，观众关心以母亲为首的许多正面人物的命运，憎恨以王柬之为首的反面群丑。剧场里嗟叹、惊诧、嘲嬉、欢笑之声不绝。就说明它是一出好戏。情节还是紧张的，对母亲和王柬之的刻划，也是鲜明的，这个戏大有可为，应不断提高。
    我感到评剧院有一股劲头，排了很多新戏就是一个明证。这次到福建前线慰问，又带回新颖的创作。我很喜欢看“三里湾”的演出，很多同志也对“爱甩辫子的姑娘”给以佳评。我感到，评剧院在为政治服务的方针上是鲜明的，在评剧艺术创造上，既大胆又有很多令人欣喜的成功。
    祝你们继续努力！
