In the Great Leap Forward year, Guangxi's orchards were filled with fragrance. The fruit tree area was expanded by 91,000 mu compared to the past; the total fruit output was 1.6 million dan, an increase of 28% compared to 1957. The famous Shatien pomelo produced 20 million fruits, an increase of 3 million; the citrus production increased by 48%, and pineapples also had a bumper harvest.

Guangxi, located in the subtropical zone, is rich in colorful fruits. There is the Chang'an kumquat, known as the best in the world, and the pineapple, known as the "King of Fruits," as well as the Shatien pomelo, a treasure among fruits; there are also major fruits such as bananas, longan, lychees, pears, peaches, plums, persimmons, dates, loquats, mangoes, walnuts, olives, star fruit, wampee, papayas, and watermelons; there are also apples introduced from the north. Every year, not only are there a variety of fresh fruits in summer and autumn, but when the north is covered with ice and snow in winter, it is the harvest season for citrus here. When the north just thaws, peaches and plums are on the market here. And the unique southern bananas, pineapples, and papayas are available all year round. It is truly "flowers fragrant in all seasons, fruits produced all year round."

    四季花香　终年产果
    大跃进的一年，广西水果芳香满园。果树面积比过去扩大了九万一千亩；水果总产一百六十万担，比1957年增产28％。在国内外享有盛名的沙田柚年产二千万个，增产三百万个，柑桔增产48％，菠萝也普遍丰收。
    广西，地处亚热带，水果丰富多彩。有号称世界第一的长安金桔，和被称为“果中之王”的菠萝，以及果中珍品的沙田柚；又有香蕉、龙眼、荔枝、梨、桃、李、柿、枣、枇杷、芒果、核桃、橄榄、洋桃、黄皮、木瓜、西瓜等主要水果；还有由北方引进的苹果。每年，不仅夏秋有多种多样的鲜果，就是冬季北方遍地冰雪的时候，这里却正是柑桔的收获季节，等到北方刚解冻，这里的桃、李就上市了。还有南方特有的香蕉、菠萝、木瓜，则是常年都有。真是“四季花香，终年产果”。
