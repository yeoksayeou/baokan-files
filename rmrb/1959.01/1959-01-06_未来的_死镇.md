    Future "Ghost Towns"
    Li Yichuan

    The Tragedy of Coal Mining Towns
    When the British government said "there's too much coal" and announced the closure of coal mines, what a misfortune it must have been for the people of the Cwmclincyn town! "We were all very surprised by this, didn't know what to do, and even wanted to cry!" miner Ted Thomas told me. Holding a piece of sparkling anthracite in his hand, he said angrily: "This is the best coal in the world. Our town is built entirely on top of coal. You could mine it for decades and never run out. I never thought of closing this best of coal mines."
    Closing such a good anthracite mine seems crazy, but in Britain today, it is indeed a reality.
    British industrial production declined last year, with the coal and steel industries being the hardest hit. The demand for coal has decreased sharply. Consumption fell by five million tons in 1957, and last year, due to insufficient operations in steel and other industries, coal consumption decreased by ten million tons. Coal stockpiles have piled up like mountains, reaching about 19 million tons. The British government has ordered the gradual closure of dozens of mines this year to reduce production.
    Cwmclincyn town in South Wales is one of the mining areas to be closed. Most of the town's two thousand residents are miners who have worked in nearby mines for generations. Rows of shops were established with miners as their main customers. The miners established schools, clubs, and cinemas with their donations; many miners also bought houses through installment payments. Once the mines are closed, the whole town will be unemployed, shops will close, and clubs and cinemas will be unable to sustain themselves. The town, which is still bustling today, will become a desolate place tomorrow, and the entire town will become a "ghost town." The residents of this town will have no choice but to leave their homes and wander elsewhere in search of work. This is truly a great tragedy for the residents of this town.

    No Hope for Employment
    But where can they go? Can they find jobs?
    Miners over the age of forty, due to long-term labor underground and harsh working conditions, most of them have one or another occupational disease: lung disease, skin disease, or back and leg injuries. Miner William said, "After being a miner for ten years, you will no longer be a complete person, so parents don't want their sons to be miners." Once these people are unemployed, they have no hope of finding employment; even young people are very pessimistic about their employment. "Where can we go?" This is a question commonly asked by young miners. The number of unemployed people in the UK is increasing every day. Before the coal mines were closed in South Wales, several tinplate factories had already closed, and a large number of unemployed people still cannot find work, so can miners find it? The British government said that other coal mines can accommodate a group of people, but the workers are not without reason to worry: "Closing coal mines is because there is too much coal. If other coal mines increase workers, there will still be the same amount of coal." Every miner's answer to this question is "no hope," "a black void ahead."
    What does unemployment mean to them? Many people rent houses, and rent still has to be paid. Some miners suffer hardship themselves, hoping that their sons can go to school and not become miners. When the economic crisis comes, this fantasy is shattered. Not only will their sons not be able to go to school, but they will also be thrown into the labor market to "compete" for jobs with their fathers.
    Families with many children feel the threat of this unemployment especially severely.
    But is there really too much coal in Britain? Coal is indeed piled up higher than mountains in the coal yards, but many workers' families do not have coal to burn. Even many miners' families only light one stove in winter. In Kenfig Hill town, not far from Cwmclincyn town, a miner named Morgan picked up some coal at the mine because he could not afford to buy coal to burn. The authorities said he "stole coal." He picked up nine pence worth of coal and was fined twenty-five shillings. Such "coal theft" is heard of every week.

    The Greatest Happiness in the Miners' Minds
    The miners' worries about their future are visible everywhere. They talk about this issue at home, in clubs, in bars, and on buses. Many older people, because they have experienced the crisis of the 1930s, feel particularly sensitive. Workers in mines that have not yet been announced to be closed are also worried, "Will it be our turn next?" They want to find a way out. They now associate the Soviet Union, China, and the absence of unemployment. Thomas is eighty-eight years old this year. When I went to his house as a guest, after he learned that I was from China, he immediately recited to me a poem about China that he remembered thoroughly from his childhood:
    "Tea comes from China,
    It is on the other side of the distant ocean.
    You brought me tea,
    All the blessed sailors." He said this was the earliest thing he remembered about China.
    "Now China is moving forward, and Wales is falling behind. Russia and China have no unemployment."
    Another miner said, "China is a star in the East. The closer you get to it, the brighter it shines." Finally, he said, "Let's see China in five years!"
    No unemployment – that is the greatest happiness they imagine now.

    It Can't Go On Like This!
    The miners' dissatisfaction and anger with the Conservative government have reached the point of intolerance. They said: "Just a few months ago, the government was posting advertisements everywhere: working in coal mines is the most secure and promising, and this job will make you satisfied for life! Now some of the advertisements the government has not had time to remove, and we are about to be thrown into the streets!"
    The workers demand to take action to oppose this reactionary measure of the government. There are three mines in Kenfig Hill town, two of which are to be closed, affecting about two thousand people. It is rumored that another mine is also going to be closed. Within two days, more than five thousand people in the town signed their names, demanding to use all means to oppose the government's closure of the mines.
    When I arrived in this town, they were holding a union meeting. A miner told me: Meetings are generally not held on Christmas Eve, but this year is special. Some of the people attending the meeting came from six or seven miles away.
    "We cannot place our hopes on some local industries. The steel industry is still laying off workers, and there are no jobs to be done in many parts of the country. We should demonstrate and take action!..." This was a speech by a young miner. Before he finished speaking, a burly middle-aged miner immediately interjected excitedly: "We should demand that Parliament reconvene. Where has Bevan, the world-famous Welsh politician, gone? Let him come and see us here." At this time, someone in the meeting place said: "To find Bevan, you have to make an appointment a month in advance!"
    At this time, a miner about fifty years old, wearing a duckbill cap, stood up. The wrinkles on his face told me that he was a person who had suffered hardships. He said very calmly but firmly: "No matter what, we have to take action, otherwise we will be wandering in the streets in a few months."
    Someone at the meeting proposed to raise fighting funds immediately.
    The meeting decided to hold a demonstration.
    The miners can't stand it anymore! (Attached picture)

    未来的“死镇”
    李一川
    煤矿镇的悲剧
    当英国政府说“煤太多了”，宣布要关闭煤矿时，这对柯木克林维克镇人民该是多么大一件不幸的事情！“我们都为这事大吃一惊，不知怎么办才好，甚至要哭了！”矿工特德·汤姆士告诉我。他手里拿着一块晶晶发亮的无烟煤气愤地说：“这是世界上最好的煤，我们这个镇完全建筑在煤的上面，你甚至再开采几十年也开采不完，我从来没有想到过要关掉这最好的煤矿。”
    关掉这么好的无烟煤矿井似乎是发疯了，但目前在英国，这的的确确是现实。
    英国去年工业生产下降，受到打击最严重的是煤钢工业。煤的需求锐减，1957年消费下降五百万吨，去年由于钢铁等各种工业开工不足，用煤减少一千万吨。存煤堆积如山，达到一千九百万吨左右。英国政府命令在今年要分批关掉几十个矿井，以便减少生产。
    南威尔士的柯木克林维克镇正是要关掉的矿井区之一。镇子上的两千余居民大部分都是矿工，他们世世代代都在附近的矿井工作。成排的商店是靠矿工为主顾建立起来的。矿工们以自己的捐献，建立了学校、俱乐部、电影院等；许多矿工并以分期付款的办法，买下了房子。一旦矿井关闭之后，全镇失业，商店就要关门，俱乐部、电影院更无法维持。今日仍然热闹的镇子，明日会变成一片荒凉之地，整个镇子就会成为一个“死镇”。这个镇上的居民就不得不背井离乡、流落他方去寻找职业。这对这个镇上的居民来说，实在是一个大悲剧。
    就业无望
    但是流落到什么地方去？他们能够找到职业吗？
    四十岁以上的矿工由于长期在井下劳动，工作条件恶劣，大部分人都有这样或那样的职业病：肺病、皮肤病，或者腰、腿受伤。矿工威廉姆说，“当过十年矿工，就不会再是一个完整的人了，所以当父母的都不愿儿子当矿工”。这些人一旦失业之后，就没有就业的希望了；即使年青人对自己的就业也非常悲观，“到什么地方去？”这是青年矿工普遍问的一个问题。全英国失业者每日都在增加，南威尔士在煤矿未关闭之前，几个马口铁厂就早已关门，大批的失业者还找不到工作，那末矿工就可以找到吗？英国政府说，其他煤矿可以容纳一批人，但工人们不无理由担忧：“关掉煤矿是因煤太多了，如果其他煤矿增加工人，煤还是同样的多”。每一个矿工对这个问题的回答都是“没有希望”、“前面漆黑一团”。
    失业对他们意味着什么呢？许多人租了房子，房租还得照付。有的矿工自己受尽苦难，希望儿子上学、不再当矿工。经济危机一来，这种幻想破灭了。儿子不仅上不成学了，并且同样会被抛到劳动市场上同父亲“竞争”职业。
    儿女多的家庭感到这种失业的威胁特别严重。
    但是英国的煤真的太多了吗？煤场上的确堆得比山还高，但是许多工人家里却没有煤烧。甚至许多矿工家里冬天也只生一个火炉。离柯木克林维克镇不远的肯维克赫尔镇，有个叫摩根的矿工，因为买不起煤烧，到矿井拣了一些煤，当局说他“偷煤”，拣了九个便士的煤，被罚了二十五个先令。这种“偷煤”的事，每星期都有所闻。
    矿工们心目中的最大幸福
    矿工们对自己前途的忧虑是到处可见的。他们在家里、在俱乐部、在酒吧间、在公共汽车上谈的都是这个问题。许多老年人因为经历过三十年代的危机，感觉特别锐敏。现在还未宣布要关闭的矿井的工人，也是忧心忡忡，“下一批是否就要轮到我们了呢？”他们要找一条出路，他们现在把苏联、中国和没有失业连系起来了。汤姆士今年八十八岁了，当我到他家里去作客时，在他知道我是从中国来的之后，马上给我背起了他儿童时代所记得烂熟的一首有关中国的诗：
    “茶来自中国，
    它在远方的大洋彼岸。
    你们给我带来了茶，
    所有祝福的海员。”他说这是他最早记得的关于中国的事。
    “现在中国在前进，威尔士在后退。俄国中国没有失业”。
    另外一个矿工说，“中国是东方的一颗明星，你越走近它，它越亮。”最后他说，“五年以后看中国吧！”
    没有失业——这就是他们现在想像中的最大幸福。
    不能这样下去了！
    矿工们对保守党政府的不满和愤怒已达到了忍无可忍的程度。他们说：“仅在几个月之前，政府还到处张贴广告：煤矿工作是最保险的，最有前途的，这个工作会使你一生都很满意！现在有些广告政府还没有来得及揭去，我们就要被抛到街头了！”
    工人们要求行动起来，反对政府的这种反动措施。肯维克赫尔镇共有三个矿井，两个要关闭，受到影响的大约两千人，传说另外一个矿井也要关闭。在两天之内，全镇五千余人都签了名，要求用一切办法，反对政府关闭矿井。
    当我到这个镇的时候，他们正在开工会大会。一位矿工告诉我：圣诞节前夕，一般都不开会，但今年特殊。参加会议的人有的是从六、七里以外赶来的。
    “我们不能把我们的希望寄托在地方上的一些工业，钢铁工业还在解雇工人，全国许多地方，也没有工作可做。我们应该示威，行动起来！……”这是一位年青矿工的发言。他还没有说完，一位身材魁梧的中年矿工马上就插上来激动地说：“我们应该要求议会复会，全世界著名的威尔士政治家比万跑到哪里去了呢？让他来我们这里看看。”这时会场里一个人说：“要找到比万得一个月以前就约好！”
    这时，一位大约五十余岁、头戴鸭帽的矿工站了起来，他脸上一道道的皱纹告诉我他是受过苦难的人，他很沉着但很坚定地说：“不管怎样，我们得行动起来，不然几个月之后，我们就会流浪街头。”
    会上有人提议马上筹集战斗资金。
    会上决议要举行游行示威。
    矿工们再也忍耐不下去了！（附图片）
    年青的矿工正为自己底未来命运而担忧
