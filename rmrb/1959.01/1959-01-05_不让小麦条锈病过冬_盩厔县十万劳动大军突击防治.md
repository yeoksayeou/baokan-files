According to Shaanxi Daily: Zhouzhi County in Shaanxi Province has organized a 100,000-strong force of men and women to carry out emergency and continuous prevention and control of wheat stripe rust. The occurrence and spread of stripe rust has now been basically controlled on 180,000 mu of wheat fields.

In order to eliminate wheat stripe rust before winter and ensure the healthy growth of wheat seedlings, Zhouzhi County has carried out a great deal of work. The first step was to organize a large number of personnel, including technical cadres from each commune, to conduct a comprehensive inspection of wheat throughout the county. Last year, the county planted more than 570,000 mu of wheat. Initially, growth was generally good, but due to excessive rainfall last year and the low-lying terrain, stripe rust spread considerably. According to incomplete statistics, the affected area reached 200,000 mu. The second step was to organize commune members to debate the issue of preventing and controlling wheat stripe rust, criticizing the complacent idea held by some people that good harvests could be achieved even without winter prevention. Subsequently, organizational structures for disease prevention were established at all levels, and more than 300 commanders and technicians were trained. After these preparations were completed, leaders at all levels personally took charge and launched a county-wide, all-people effort to prevent and control wheat stripe rust. As of December 18 last year, using only methods of cutting and burying diseased leaves, 180,000 mu of wheat fields had been universally treated twice, and some wheat fields had been treated three times. The prevention and control effect was generally above 75%-90%, basically controlling the occurrence and spread of stripe rust.

In order to ensure the complete elimination of stripe rust, by December 15 last year, a total of 167 indigenous pesticide processing plants had been established throughout the county.

According to Yunnan Daily: The 43,000-plus mu of spring crops in Dongfeng People's Commune, Zhaotong County, are generally growing well. This is the result of the commune party secretary taking the lead, fully mobilizing the masses to conduct field-by-field inspections and assessments, and then improving various measures, greatly strengthening the field management of spring crops.

The commune party committee divided the commune's sixteen brigades into five zones, and used a combination of inspection team inspections and commune member inspections to conduct a general inspection of the commune's 43,000-plus mu of wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed. During the inspection, each brigade not only continuously announced the ranking results to the masses, but also actively took measures, addressing problems as they were identified and studied solutions and took action simultaneously.

Currently, wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed throughout the commune have been universally irrigated and top-dressed once, and high-yield fields have generally been top-dressed and hoed once each.

    不让小麦条锈病过冬
    盩厔县十万劳动大军突击防治
    据陕西日报消息　陕西盩厔县组织了十万男女大军，对小麦条锈病进行突击防治和连续防治，现在对十八万亩麦田基本上控制了条锈病的发生蔓延。
    为了把小麦条锈病消灭在冬前，确保麦苗健旺生长，盩厔县进行了许多工作。第一步组织了由各公社技术干部参加的大批人力，对全县小麦进行了一次全面检查。全县去年共种小麦五十七万多亩，初期一般生长良好，但因去年雨水过多，加之地势低下，条锈病繁殖相当严重，据不完全统计，发生病害面积达二十万亩。第二步即组织社员就防治小麦条锈病问题展开了争辩，批判了一些人认为冬季不防同样能丰收的轻敌思想，即层层建立了防治病害的组织机构和训练了指挥员、技术员三百多名。这些工作准备好以后，各级领导亲自挂帅，展开了全党动员，全民动手的防治小麦条锈病工作。截至去年12月18日止，仅用切叶、埋叶防治条锈病的办法，把十八万亩麦田普遍防治了两次，部分小麦防治了三次，防治效果一般均在75％—90％以上，基本控制了条锈病的发生和蔓延。
    为了保证彻底消灭条锈病，到去年12月15日止，全县共建立土农药加工厂一百六十七座。
    据云南日报消息　昭通县东风人民公社四万三千多亩小春，普遍成长良好。这是该社党委书记挂帅，充分发动群众进行逐块检查、逐亩鉴定，然后弥补各项措施，促使小春田间管理工作大大加强起来的结果。
    公社党委将全社十六个大队分为五个片，以检查团检查和社员检查相结合的方法，对全社四万三千多亩小麦、蚕豆、油菜普遍进行了一次检查。各大队在检查中，一面不断向群众公布排队结果，一面积极采取措施，边检查、边发现问题就边研究解决办法、边行动。
    现在，全公社小麦、蚕豆、油菜已普遍润水、追肥一次，丰产地一般追肥各一次，薅锄一次。
