    Singing Loudly on New Year's Day
    Lao She
    Before the New Year, after reading the communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the resolution on several issues concerning the people's communes, I was so happy that I didn't know what to say! Every single matter mentioned in the communique and resolution deserves our careful thought and good writing. Yes, how many unprecedented things are mentioned in these two major documents! Who has ever seen steel production double in a year, and grain production also double? Besides steel and grain, how many satellites have soared into the clouds! I want to sing the praises of the great leap forward in steel, the great leap forward in grain, and all the great leaps forward! I want to sing the praises of the people's communes, the cultural revolution, and all the happy events of 1958! I hope that the people of the whole country will be even happier, laugh even louder, become even more delighted as they think about it, and have even stronger and more sufficient drive! Our cheers shake the heavens and the earth, causing the fools like Dulles to tremble again and again, until they can't even fabricate rumors anymore!
    So, I wrote two poems. The poems are not very good, but they express the joy in my heart to some extent. I'll just write them here:
    The Whole Nation Leaps Forward
    Six hundred million people leap forward with might,
    Striving to be first, daring to act, no difficulty in sight.
    Deep thought commands certainty,
    Poems and songs herald victory, skills rivaling gods in sight.
    In a single spring breeze,
    Splendor for twenty years, shining bright.
    Steel Commander Reports Victory
    Drums beat in celebration, honoring the heroic vanguard,
    Thunderous, a thousand, hundred volleys ring.
    Steel currents surge day and night,
    Iron seas temper heroes bold.
    Machinery inaugurates a new history,
    City and countryside interweave in a colorful rainbow.
    The year nears its end, spring is not far,
    Flowers reflect the banners of the commanders, red and gold.
    With last year's glorious achievements, it is not hard to imagine the joy of this year's New Year's Day. I have lived for sixty years, and where have I ever seen the people of the whole country living such a happy, confident, and well-fed New Year's Day! We are not satisfied with just being well-fed, we must continue to leap forward. Last year it was a thousand miles a day, this year it must be ten thousand miles a day! We are not only stepping up production and striving for the top, but we are also making a big splash in the cultural revolution! Look, whether in the city or the countryside, everywhere is filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and everyone is putting on performances, singing songs, dancing, and even performing operas! Uncles and aunts, girls and young men are all on stage! Workers sing, farmers dance, and students are having even more fun. All the songs, dances, and performances they put on are their own creations! Isn't this a remarkable thing? It's truly remarkable! The people are doing earth-shattering things, and of course they want to express themselves. Our enthusiasm for literary and artistic creation is inseparable from our enthusiasm for production. Yes, we are all so well-rounded, both in literacy and martial arts, each with wings on our backs, leaping towards a paradise on earth! Good! I must write more poems! Again, two seven-character律诗, whether they are good or not, at least they have a lot of enthusiasm:
    Singing Loudly on New Year's Day
    Welcoming the New Year with song, carefree and busy,
    Hanging lanterns, brewing wine, rushing to write.
    The lonely king ruled for three thousand years,
    Now the people are the masters of their own homes, a first-time right.
    Brilliant stars are within reach,
    Magnificent scenes sing and echo with delight.
    Do not pity the white hair encroaching on the temples,
    The song of Communism resounds throughout heaven and earth, day and night.
    How many times has the human world seen a new year like this?
    Today, everyone is well-fed and warm, enjoying life to the fullest,
    Heroic feelings move mountains with a wave of the hand,
    Lofty spirit raises its head and annihilates demons and gods.
    Too lazy to write about the snow and moon,
    Happy to temper the body with labor and gain a golden physique.
    The sound of firecrackers echoes in the sky,
    Soar high and far, take advantage of the early spring.

    元旦放歌
    老舍
    年前，读了中国共产党八届六中全会的公报和关于人民公社若干问题的决议，我真喜欢得不知说什么才好了！公报与决议中所提到的任何一事都值得我们细细地想，好好地写文章。是呀，这两大文件里提到多少史无前例的事啊！谁见过一年中钢加一番，粮增一倍；钢与粮而外，还有多少卫星飞上云霄啊！我要歌颂钢的跃进，粮的跃进，和一切跃进！我要歌颂人民公社、文化革命，和1958年所有的喜事！我希望全国人民都喜了再喜，笑了再笑，越想越高兴，干劲也越猛越足！我们的欢声撼动天地，叫杜勒斯之流的蠢人抖了再抖，颤了再颤，以至连谣言都再也造不上来！
    我就写了两首诗。诗写的不怎么好，可是多少道出我心中的欢悦。就写在这里：
    全民跃进堂堂六亿众跃进奋争先敢干无难事深思操必然诗谣歌胜利身手傲神仙一日东风里辉煌二十年
    钢帅报捷擂鼓贺元戎雷鸣千百通钢流奔日夜铁海炼英雄机械开新史城乡交彩虹岁残春不远花映帅旗红
    有去年的辉皇成就，今年元旦的欢悦就不难想像了。我活了六十岁，哪里见过全国人民都过着这么快活，这么自信，这么酒足饭饱的元旦呢！我们并不满足于酒足饭饱，我们还要继续跃进，去年一日千里，今年要一日万里啊！我们不仅加紧生产，力争上游，我们同时也大闹文化革命啊。看，连城里带乡村，哪里不是锣鼓喧天，粉墨登场，歌的歌，舞的舞，还演大戏呀！伯伯大娘，姑娘与小伙子都上了台啊！工也歌，农也舞，学生们闹的更欢。他们歌的舞的演的全是自己的创作啊。这难道不是了不起的事么？真了不起！人民干出惊天动地的事，当然要表现自己。我们的文艺创作热情正和生产热情是分不开的呀。是，我们就是这么人人文武双全，个个背生双翅，向人间乐园飞跃！好啊，还得作诗啊！又得七律二首，好不好的，反正有股子热气儿：
    元旦放歌迎接新年信意忙悬灯煮酒赶文章孤王作主三千载百姓当家头一场灿烂群星攀可及峥嵘万象唱应狂莫怜白发侵双鬓共产歌声天地长几见人间岁月新只今饱暖乐全民豪情唾手移山岳浩气昂头灭鬼神懒作风流吟雪月喜凭劳动炼金身声声爆竹连天响远举高翔趁早春
