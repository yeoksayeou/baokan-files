Xinhua News Agency, January 27th - The Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference today to expose the truth about the bloody crimes committed by American imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam, where over a thousand Vietnamese patriots were massacred. Pham Binh, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, revealed to dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists that this massacre was an extremely barbaric one, unseen in the world during peacetime, and that it exposed the fascist and dictatorial nature of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. Pham Binh called on world public opinion to take a fair attitude towards this and uphold human justice.

Pham Binh gave the journalists a detailed account of the Phu Loi massacre. He said that the Phu Loi concentration camp, located 33 kilometers from Saigon, was called a "Central Re-education Center" by them. This concentration camp was indeed a hell on earth. The prison cells were narrow and suffocating. Each person received only a few taels of moldy rice, a little salt, and rotten, maggot-infested dried fish each day. The daily drink was only one milk can of raw water. Due to the harsh maltreatment in the prison, diseases such as dysentery, edema, malaria, and lung disease occurred frequently, and five to seven people died every day, with the death toll reaching two hundred in some months.

Pham Binh said that despite this, they were still unable to conquer the patriotic spirit and fighting will of the imprisoned people, so they had to resort to large-scale massacres.

On December 1, 1958, the executioners poisoned the food, attempting to poison six thousand lives at once. After the meal, everyone was in so much pain that they screamed, rolled around, and struggled.

When everyone discovered the poisoning, the entire camp immediately rioted and shouted for help, demanding that the prison doors be opened for treatment. However, the prison guards had already received orders to lock the cells tightly and deployed troops to strictly guard the concentration camp. Some people climbed onto the roof, threw roof tiles outside the cells, and shouted for help, only to be shot dead by them. The shouts shook the entire area and reached the ears of the people two kilometers away. At this time, they opened fire on the prison, killing more people. On that day alone, more than a thousand people died, and thousands of others were severely poisoned and in critical condition.

Later, the survivors continued to struggle, demanding medical treatment. Fellow compatriots living nearby also came to the concentration camp in groups to struggle; thousands of people bought medicine and asked to help treat the victims. In this situation, the South Vietnamese authorities were panic-stricken. On the one hand, they spread rumors that so many people died because of an epidemic. On the other hand, they even attempted to extinguish the people's struggle and destroy the evidence by even more cruel means. They poured gasoline and burned some of the cells, burning the corpses, and thus burning some people to death. They sent three hundred people, falsely accused of being the leaders of this struggle, to other places, and continued to disperse the survivors to many places thousands of kilometers away from the concentration camp, such as Hue. At the same time, they transferred some people who were originally imprisoned in other places to the Phu Loi concentration camp, attempting to eliminate their criminal evidence. On the night of December 1, 1958, and December 2, they hurriedly transferred a regiment of regular troops, including paratroopers and armored troops, from Saigon to Phu Loi to surround and suppress the people's struggle.

Another division of troops was stationed near the concentration camp, ready to reinforce the above-mentioned military forces at any time. Two security companies and some overt or plainclothes public security and police personnel were also transferred from Saigon. They took terrorist measures against anyone who had sympathized with the struggle of those who had survived.

Pham Binh pointed out that on January 22, 1959, the South Vietnamese "Republican Army Radio Station" revealed that three warships of the US Pacific Seventh Fleet were about to arrive in Saigon. Under such circumstances, this action was by no means accidental. The above facts made people even more aware that the South Vietnamese authorities' criminal acts were receiving direct and active support from American imperialism.

Pham Binh revealed that according to incomplete statistics, since the restoration of peace until November 1957, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime had created 6,172 retaliation and terror incidents in South Vietnam, killing 2,293 former resistance personnel, with 778 missing and 5,185 injured; 65,211 people were illegally arrested, and this number increased to more than 183,000 by 1958. They are now planning to establish another 20 concentration camps in various provinces of South Vietnam in 1959.

Pham Binh said that for more than four years, the people of South Vietnam have never ceased their struggle for the cause of national reunification and against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's implementation of barbaric terror and suppression. The occurrence of the Phu Loi massacre has made the flames of this struggle burn even more fiercely. In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, all the people are filled with anger, and the struggle movement against the Phu Loi massacre is developing like a magnificent wave.

Pham Binh said that the Vietnamese people's struggle against the Phu Loi massacre is also a struggle against the conspiracy of American imperialism and its followers to sabotage the Geneva Accords, obstruct Vietnam's reunification, and attempt to turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of American imperialism. In this struggle, justice belongs to us. With the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, we are deeply convinced that we will achieve final victory.

Pham Binh finally answered questions raised by the journalists. Regarding the journalist's question about what attitude the Vietnamese International Committee will take towards the on-site investigation, Pham Binh replied that as of yesterday, the Vietnamese International Committee had not yet expressed its attitude towards the issue of the on-site investigation, but the Vietnamese International Committee has the responsibility to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and it is believed that they will take a positive attitude.

    越南驻华大使馆举行记者招待会指出
    富利惨案是灭绝人性的血腥屠杀
    吴庭艳集团的罪行得到美帝国主义积极支持
    新华社27日讯　越南民主共和国大使馆今天举行记者招待会，揭露美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团在南越富利集中营制造屠杀一千多名越南爱国者血腥罪行的真象。越南民主共和国驻华大使馆临时代办范平向数十名中外记者揭露说，这个惨案是在和平时期世界上未曾见过的极其野蛮的一次大屠杀，它揭穿了吴庭艳政权的法西斯独裁性质。范平要求全世界的舆论对此采取公正态度，维护人类的正义。
    范平向记者们详细陈述了富利惨案的经过情况。范平说，富利集中营距西贡市三十三公里，他们称之为“中央训政中心”。这个集中营的确是个人间地狱。牢房狭窄，令人窒息。每人每天只得到几两发霉的米饭和少许食盐以及发霉生蛆的臭鱼干充饥。每天的饮料只有一个牛奶罐的生水。由于狱中苛刻的虐待，痢疾、浮肿、疟疾、肺病等疾病经常发生，每天都有五、七个人死亡，甚至有的月份死亡人数达到二百名。
    范平说，尽管如此，他们仍然不能征服被监禁的人们的爱国精神和斗争意志，所以必须使用大规模的屠杀手段。
    1958年12月1日，刽子手们在饭里下了毒药，企图一下毒死六千条生命。饭后每个人都痛得呼喊、打滚和挣扎。
    当大伙发现中毒后，全营人立即骚动和大声呼救，要求打开狱门给予救治。但是狱警早已接到命令紧锁牢房，而且派出军队在集中营周围严密防范。一部分人爬上屋顶，把屋瓦扔向牢外并大声呼救，竟被他们开枪打死。呼喊声震动了整个地区，一直传到了两公里外的老百姓的耳中。这时他们向监狱里开枪射击，又打死了一部分人。只在当天就有一千多人死亡，其余成千的人也中毒重伤生命垂危。
    后来，幸免活着的人继续进行斗争，要求设法救治。在附近居住的同胞也成群结队地到集中营进行斗争；成千人买了医药要求协助救治受害者。在这种情况下，南越当局惊惶失措，他们一方面造谣说一次死那么多人是由于发生了疫病，另一方面竟以更加残酷的手段企图扑灭人民的斗争和毁尸灭迹，他们洒下汽油焚烧了一部分牢房，烧毁尸骸，因而又烧死了一些人。他们把三百名被诬控为这次斗争的领导人送到其他地方去，继续把幸存的人遣散到距离集中营成千公里远的许多地方去，如遣散到顺化等地。同时又把原被监禁在其他地方的一部分人解到富利集中营来，企图消灭其罪证。他们还在1958年12月1日夜里和12月2日仓皇地从西贡调到富利一团正规军，其中包括伞兵、装甲兵等，借以包围和镇压人民的斗争。
    另一个师的军队则驻扎在集中营附近，随时准备增援上述的军事力量。两个保安连和一些公开或便衣的公安和警察人员也相继从西贡市调来。他们对曾经同情这次死中生还的人的斗争的任何人采取恐怖手段。
    范平指出：1959年1月22日，南越“共和军队广播电台”又透露说，美国太平洋第七舰队的三艘军舰即将到达西贡市。在这种迹象下，这个行动决不是偶然的。上述事实使人们更加认识到南越当局的罪恶行为是得到美帝国主义的直接和积极支持的。
    范平揭露说，根据不完全的统计，自从和平恢复到1957年11月间，吴庭艳政权就在南越各地制造了六千一百七十二起报复恐怖事件，杀害前抗战人员二千二百九十三人，失踪的七百七十八人，受伤的五千一百八十五人；非法逮捕的有六万五千二百十一人，到1958年增加到十八万三千多人。现在他们计划在1959年内在南越各省再建立二十个集中营。
    范平说，四年多以来，我们南越人民从未间断过为争取祖国统一事业、反对吴庭艳政权施行野蛮的恐怖镇压手段而进行斗争。富利大屠杀惨案的发生，使这个斗争的火焰燃烧得更加猛烈。在越南民主共和国，全体人民愤怒填胸，反对富利大屠杀惨案的斗争运动像壮阔的波澜般开展着。
    范平说，越南人民反对富利大屠杀惨案的斗争，同样也是反对美帝国主义及其追随者阴谋破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的统一，企图把南越变成为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地的斗争。在这个斗争中，正义是属于我们的。在全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，我们深信一定会取得最后的胜利。
    范平最后答复了记者们提出的问题。关于记者提出的越南国际委员会对于现场调查将采取什么态度的问题，范平答复说，到昨天为止，越南国际委员会对于现场调查的问题还没有表示态度，但是，越南国际委员会有责任保证日内瓦协议的执行，相信他们将会采取积极的态度。
