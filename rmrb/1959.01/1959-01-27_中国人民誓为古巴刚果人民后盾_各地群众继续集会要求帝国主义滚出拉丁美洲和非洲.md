Xinhua News Agency Report: Mass rallies continue in many cities across the country in support of the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese peoples.

The activities of the Shanghai people in support of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Cuban and Congolese peoples have reached a climax. On the 26th, more than 80,000 workers, farmers, students, government cadres, neighborhood residents, and garrison troops held rallies. A grand rally held in the Cultural Square in the city center was attended by more than 8,000 people.

After Jin Zhonghua, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, announced the opening of the meeting, Wei Wenbo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the new storm sweeping from Cuba would surely sweep across Latin America, and the days of US imperialism in Latin America would be even more difficult. In the boiling Africa, the rise of the Congolese people is like the eruption of a new volcano, which has also shaken the entire colonial world. Imperialism is not only rotting, but also rotting faster and faster. Wei Wenbo said that the people of Shanghai had suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a century, so they have deep sympathy for the Cuban people and the Congolese people who are fighting heroically against US imperialism and Belgian colonialists. We regard their struggle as our own struggle, and their victory as our own victory. We must stand together with the people of the whole country and the people of the world to firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban people and the Congolese people. Representatives of various democratic parties in Shanghai, Zhao Zukang, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Tang Guifen, Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation Guo Jian, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association Ba Jin, representatives of industry and commerce Rong Yiren, representatives of religious circles Wu Yaozong, Liu Ajiu, an old worker of the No. 9 State Cotton Factory who participated in the "May 30th" general strike and the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, farmer representative Shen Fuquan, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association Su Buqing, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Youth Federation Fei Fuquan, and Chairman of the Jiaotong University Student Union Chen Tinglai all expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people in their speeches. At the end of each person's speech, all 8,000 people in the audience raised their arms and shouted slogans: "Imperialists get out of Latin America!" "Imperialists get out of Africa!" "Imperialists get out of Asia!" "Down with the imperialist colonial system!"

More than 1,700 people from all walks of life in Shenyang held a meeting on the 26th. Wu Tieming, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting that the great victory of the national democratic revolution of the Cuban people and the heroic struggle of the Congolese people against colonial rule are a heavy blow to the imperialist group headed by US imperialism, and also foreshadow that the national revolutionary movement around the world will have further upsurge this year. Representatives from all walks of life in Shenyang also spoke at the meeting one after another.

The Chinese people, the Cuban people and the people of Latin America, the Congolese people and the people of Africa, have common demands and interests in the struggle against imperialist aggression, for national independence, and for defending world peace. Therefore, the Chinese people regard the struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people as their own struggle, and the victory of the Cuban and Congolese people as their own victory. We, together with the people of the world, firmly support the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle for independence, freedom and democracy, and firmly oppose US imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian authorities' barbarous suppression of the Congolese people.

Peng Chong, member of the Standing Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Mayor of Nanjing, cited many facts in his speech to show that US imperialism is doing everything possible to conspire to interfere in the internal affairs of countries striving for national independence.
