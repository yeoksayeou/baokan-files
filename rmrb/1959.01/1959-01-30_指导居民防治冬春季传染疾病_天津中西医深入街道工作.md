Guiding Residents in the Prevention and Control of Winter and Spring Infectious Diseases
Tianjin Combines Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Work Deep in the Streets
(Our report) More than 3,000 traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors in Tianjin have actively engaged in guiding residential areas to carry out prevention and control of winter and spring infectious diseases, with hospitals as the center.

Since Tianjin launched the winter patriotic health campaign centered on the prevention and treatment of measles in November last year, medical staff from all hospitals in the city immediately took action, cooperated with local medical and prevention departments, and divided up the work to strengthen epidemic prevention and health work in the streets. Many hospitals also used posters, big-character posters, broadcasts, and door-to-door publicity to explain epidemic prevention knowledge to the masses. All medical staff of Xinhua Hospital participated in epidemic prevention publicity and epidemic investigation work, and divided into departments to cover residential areas, setting up a dozen doctors and nurses to specialize in circulating in residential areas for infectious disease prevention and treatment work.

The vast number of medical staff showed great enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Many hospitals of traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors put forward a number of prescriptions based on their clinical experience, and then repeatedly studied and determined several drugs suitable for promotion. The Tianjin Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital not only opened a special clinic for influenza to prevent and treat the highly threatening influenza, but also in the prevention and treatment of measles, veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors such as Lu Guanhua sorted out their many years of clinical experience and introduced it to everyone. The traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors of this hospital also determined how to better prevent measles as one of this year's scientific research projects.

In terms of treatment, traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperate, and according to the patient's condition, take Chinese medicine, Western medicine, or both. This method has achieved many results in the treatment of measles. Some children who developed the disease were found to have relatively difficult-to-treat Staphylococcus aureus after examination, but after Western medicine injections of glucose, blood transfusions, instillation of breast milk, and traditional Chinese medicine using Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang and other drugs, many children have been cured. In order to save a child with measles complicated by pneumonia, Song Yuru, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Tianjin Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, prescribed traditional Chinese medicine while cooperating with Western medicine stimulation therapy to treat. She needed to transfuse breast blood, but the sick child's mother was in poor health and could not transfuse blood. When Song Yuru learned that her blood type was the same as the sick child's mother's blood type, she did not hesitate to transfuse blood for the sick child, and finally made the child recover to health.

    指导居民防治冬春季传染疾病
    天津中西医深入街道工作
    本报讯　天津市全部中、西医生三千多人，积极投入了以医院为中心，指导居民区开展防治冬春季传染病的工作。
    天津市从去年11月，开始展开以防治麻疹为中心的冬季爱国卫生运动以后，全市所有医院的医护人员立即行动起来，和地段医疗预防部门合作，分片包干，深入街道加强防疫卫生工作。许多医院还用宣传画、大字报、广播和入户宣传等方式向群众讲解防疫知识。新华医院全体医护人员都参加了防疫宣传和疫情调查的工作，并且分科包居民区，设医生和护士十几人，专门巡回居民区作防治传染病工作。
    广大的医护人员在防治传染病工作中，表现了极大的热情和责任感。许多医院的中、西医都根据自己的临床经验提出若干药方，然后经过反复研究确定几种适于推广的药品。天津中医医院不仅开设了流行性感冒专科门诊，以防治对人体威胁很大的流行性感冒，在防治麻疹方面，陆观虎等老中医将他们多年来的临床经验，整理出来向大家作了介绍。这个医院的中西医还确定将如何更好地预防麻疹，作为今年的科学研究项目之一。
    在治疗方面，也是中西医合作，根据患者的病情，分别服中、西药或中西药并服。这种办法，在治疗麻疹上取得了不少效果。有些发病儿童，经检查发现有比较难治的金黄色葡萄球菌，但是经西医注射葡萄糖、输血、滴母乳和中医用麻杏石甘汤等药物治疗，已经治好了不少患儿。天津中医医院中医宋玉茹为了挽救一个麻疹并发性肺炎的儿童，服中药同时，配合用西医刺激疗法治疗，要输母血，但是病儿母亲身体不好，不能输血，当宋玉茹知道她的血型和病儿母亲的血型一样时，就毫不犹疑地为病儿输了血，终于使患儿恢复了健康。
