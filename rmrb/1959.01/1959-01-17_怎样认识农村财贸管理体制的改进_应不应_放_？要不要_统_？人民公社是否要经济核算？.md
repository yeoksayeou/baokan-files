"Two loosenings, three unifications, and one contract" is a summary of the measures taken by the state to adapt to the development of people's communes and improve the rural financial and trade management system. The so-called two loosenings refer to the decentralization of personnel and assets; the so-called three unifications refer to the unified policy, unified planning, and unified management of working capital; the so-called one contract refers to contracting financial tasks. In general, on the one hand, the state decentralizes rural financial and trade institutions to people's communes for management and operation, and on the other hand, the communes must act in accordance with the state's unified policies and unified plans; on the one hand, the income of rural financial and trade institutions is collected by the communes, and on the other hand, the communes must hand over an appropriate portion of their total income to the state through the channel of fiscal revenue under a contract system. "Two loosenings, three unifications, and one contract" is a unified and inseparable whole. Loosening is based on the premise of unification, and loosening does not mean letting go and ignoring; unification is based on loosening, and unification does not exclude the communes' due flexibility and initiative. Loosening can better mobilize the enthusiasm of the people's communes and better serve the communes' production with financial and trade work; unification can better ensure the centralized leadership of the state and meet the requirements of a socialist planned economy. Loosening and unification are a unity of opposites, a concrete application of democratic centralism in rural financial and trade work, and financial contracting reflects the fiscal relationship between the state and the communes based on the principles of loosening and unification. Such an improvement in the rural financial and trade management system, as stated in the "Decision on Improving the Rural Financial and Trade Management System to Adapt to the Situation of People's Communes" by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, "can not only ensure the comprehensive implementation of the state's various financial and economic policies, but also facilitate the people's communes to handle business flexibly under the conditions of policy implementation; it can not only ensure the implementation of the state's unified plans, but also facilitate the people's communes to make comprehensive management and arrangements for industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs; it can not only ensure the state's fiscal revenue, but also facilitate the full mobilization of the people's communes' enthusiasm for developing production and increasing accumulation."

The implementation of the "two loosenings, three unifications, and one contract" is a major improvement in the rural financial and trade management system and a new issue. Therefore, among financial and trade workers and other cadres, there may be various views on this improvement: there may be conservative ideas that lag behind reality, doubting whether loosening is good; there may be localist ideas that disregard the overall situation, doubting whether such unification is necessary since it has been loosened; there may also be a simple idea that since people's communes share profits and losses, is economic accounting still necessary within the communes? It seems that thoroughly clarifying these issues is necessary to unify thinking and do a good job.

	I. On the Issue of Whether to "Loosen" or Not

The rural financial and trade management system is a fundamental system for the state to manage rural financial and trade work. It stipulates the working relationship and scope of authority between the state's financial and trade departments and the people's communes' financial and trade institutions, thereby stipulating the relationship between the state and the communes in terms of finance and trade. At the beginning of implementing the new rural financial and trade management system, the first issue encountered is whether to "loosen" or not. Some comrades doubt whether decentralizing the state's financial and trade institutions to the people's communes is a step backward from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership? Can the people's communes do a good job in financial and trade work? After the cadres are decentralized, will their status be lowered from being state workers to being commune workers? These doubts reflect a common issue, that is, how to understand the nature of the people's communes and whether to trust the Party and the masses.

It should be viewed this way: the transformation from agricultural producers' cooperatives to people's communes itself expanded and improved the original collective ownership and brought with it some elements of ownership by the whole people. Decentralizing the state's grassroots financial and trade institutions to the people's communes is decentralizing management and usage rights and should not be understood as a change in ownership. After these institutions are decentralized, on the one hand, they become part of the people's communes, and on the other hand, they are still grassroots units of the state's financial and trade departments; on the one hand, they are managed and operated by the people's communes, and on the other hand, they still belong to ownership by the whole people. Therefore, this decentralization actually increases the element of ownership by the whole people in the people's communes. After these institutions are decentralized, the state's financial and trade departments will continue to provide business guidance and will also provide specific guidance to rural financial and trade work through the people's communes. Therefore, this decentralization can be said to further strengthen the state's leadership over the people's communes. It is precisely because of this that it is more conducive to the people's communes' transition to ownership by the whole people. This is not a retreat, but an advance.

It should be viewed this way: the people's communes are under the leadership of the Party. The Party's leadership includes the leadership of the Central Committee, provincial Party committees, prefectural Party committees, and county Party committees, as well as the leadership of the commune Party committees. For financial and trade business departments at all levels, relying on the Party's leadership means first relying on the leadership of the Party committee at the same level. The Party can lead politics, lead military affairs, lead industrial and agricultural production, and lead so well, is it possible that it alone cannot lead financial and trade work well? The people's communes are established on the basis of the enhanced ideological awareness of the broad masses. The masses, whose communist consciousness has been greatly enhanced through land reform, agricultural cooperativization, and the people's commune movement, have the methods and the power to overcome various difficulties and ensure that rural financial and trade work is done better than in the past, and will not be done worse. The people's communes are a product of the great leap in production, and their establishment will further promote the rapid development of productive forces; on the basis of production development, commodity circulation will be further expanded, the state's fiscal revenue will be more guaranteed, and rural financial and trade work can certainly be done better. Of course, at the beginning of decentralization, due to lack of experience, temporary disconnection in individual places and individual links is possible. But as long as attention is paid, relying on the Party's leadership, relying on the strength of the masses, and taking measures, this disconnection can be prevented and corrected.

It should be viewed this way: accelerating socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism through the organizational form of people's communes is precisely the great ideal of us communists, and the title of commune member is precisely the title that our revolutionary cadres take pride in. In the future, we will gradually achieve being both manual laborers and mental laborers, both cadres and ordinary laborers. Every revolutionary cadre should move towards this ideal. The current commune has implemented the integration of government and commune and is a part of the state power organization. The cadres of the commune are also the cadres of the state. In the future, with the consolidation of grassroots communes and the establishment of federated communes, and with the gradual communization of cities, most state cadres will also be cadres of the commune. Therefore, every revolutionary cadre with a high degree of communist consciousness should welcome this decentralization and, together with the broad masses of commune members, go all out, use their brains, and do a good job in financial and trade work after decentralization. We should look forward, not backward, and look at the big picture, not just haggle over personal gains and losses.

According to the experience of several places that have recently begun to implement it, there are many benefits to decentralizing financial and trade institutions to be managed by the communes. Preliminary analysis shows that there are at least the following three points: First, the relationship between industry, agriculture, and commerce in the communes is closer. Finance, commerce, and credit have become an organizational part of the entire economic activity of the commune. In the past, they were two separate entities, and now they have become one. This can more closely coordinate with the development of industrial and agricultural production, which is conducive to the consolidation and improvement of the people's communes. Second, the decentralization of financial and trade institutions, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, puts financial and trade work within the scope of the commune Party committee's overall arrangements and overall planning. The leadership of the grassroots Party committee over financial and trade work has been strengthened, which is conducive to the mutual cooperation and common leap forward of financial and trade work with other work, and overall development. Third, the decentralization of financial and trade institutions brings the relationship between financial and trade work and the masses closer. The broad masses of commune members are more concerned about financial and trade work, which is conducive to further assistance and supervision from the masses. What does the state need to purchase, transport, or what problems are there in sales? Once the Party committee speaks and the masses are mobilized, any difficulties are relatively easy to solve. If financial and trade workers have shortcomings or problems in their work, the masses will also help them correct and solve them with a greater sense of responsibility. What reason is there to doubt the correctness and necessity of decentralization?

	II. On the Issue of Whether to "Unify" or Not

Does the improvement of the rural financial and trade management system, by decentralizing the state's rural financial and trade institutions to the people's communes, mean that the people's communes can freely conduct commercial activities and can rely on commercial profits to increase income? Does it mean that the people's communes can arbitrarily change commodity prices? Does it mean that the people's communes can use the decentralized working capital for other purposes at will? These doubts also reflect a common issue, that is, how to recognize the necessity of implementing the "three unifications" on the basis of decentralization, that is, how to recognize the important principle that socialist economy must implement unified leadership and planned management.

The people's commune is a comprehensive organization with a high degree of organization and planning. After the establishment of the commune, the free market basically no longer exists. The decentralization of rural commercial institutions should be conducive to strengthening the state's management of the market and strengthening the planning of financial and trade work, and should not weaken market management and planned management. According to regulations, for materials subject to unified purchase and unified acquisition and other important materials, the people's communes should sell them to higher-level commercial institutions if they need to sell them, and should purchase them from higher-level commercial institutions if they need to purchase them. They must not trade among themselves or go to distant places for trading; the people's communes must not purchase materials from outside the commune and resell them to the state, nor can they resell materials purchased from state commercial institutions to outside the commune, and cannot engage in intermediary operations; if the people's communes need to sell some minor products and scattered products, or need to purchase some special commodities, which higher-level commercial institutions cannot acquire and supply, they can conclude contracts with other communes under the leadership of higher-level commercial institutions for exchange, or they can go to appropriate places for purchasing and sales with approval. One important aspect of why our socialism is superior to capitalism is the implementation of a planned economy. Production is planned, and circulation is also planned. The capitalist economy relies on the spontaneous action of the law of value to adjust market supply and demand through blind free competition. The socialist economy can rely on planned adjustments and arrangements to achieve balance. Decentralizing rural financial and trade institutions to the people's communes is to facilitate the unified leadership of the communes and to better serve the production of the communes and the consumption of the commune members, and not to allow the communes to earn commercial profits through commercial operations. The only way for the people's communes to increase internal accumulation and commune members' income is to increase production, improve management, and save expenses, and not to focus on commercial profits, not to convert income that should belong to the state into their own income, and not to violate relevant state regulations and exceed the normal scope. It can be imagined that if the communes are allowed to trade with anyone in any place at will, and do not act in accordance with the state's market management principles, the result will inevitably disrupt the state's commodity circulation plan and cause chaos. From a local perspective, doing so may earn a little more money; but from a global perspective, it will cause great waste, form a free market, and shake the socialist planned economy.

Commodity prices are an important tool for adjusting national accumulation and individual consumption, and for adjusting the interests of producers and consumers. When the state formulates commodity prices, it needs to take into account many factors. It is necessary to consider both variety price differences, that is, how much this commodity costs and how much that commodity costs; it is also necessary to consider regional price differences, that is, how much the price is in this region and how much it is in that region; it is also necessary to consider purchase and sale price differences, that is, how much the purchase price is and how much the selling price is. Various price differences are stipulated according to specific circumstances. Price stability is an important aspect of market stability. A change in the price of one commodity will affect other commodities; a change in the price in one region will affect other regions; inappropriately changing prices will seriously affect the interests of producers and consumers. If prices are not under the unified leadership and control of the state, and it is allowed to arbitrarily raise and lower prices, selling to whoever offers the higher price, and buying from whoever offers the cheaper price, and everyone does this, what consequences will it bring to the market? Therefore, according to regulations, when communes deliver agricultural and sideline products to the state, they must implement the state-stipulated purchase prices; when communes sell goods distributed by the state, they must implement the state-stipulated retail prices; when communes sell their own products within the commune or exchange them with other communes, and if there are state-stipulated prices, they should implement the state regulations; if the state has not stipulated prices, they should appropriately determine them with reference to the state-stipulated prices of similar commodities. Communes have no right to change commodity prices stipulated by the state themselves. When we say that commodity prices cannot be changed at will, it does not mean that if the situation has changed and some commodity prices are indeed unreasonable, necessary adjustments will not be made, but that such adjustments must be approved by relevant departments at all levels in accordance with the regulations of the price management system. Communes can put forward opinions on unreasonable prices.

Working capital is the capital used by industrial and commercial enterprises for production and commodity circulation, and is used to purchase raw materials and goods. The money goes out, the goods come back, the goods go out, the money comes back, and it is constantly maintained to ensure the normal progress of production and circulation. The state has the following boundaries for the management of working capital: working capital cannot generally be used for capital construction expenditures or fiscal expenditures; except for special approvals, it cannot be used to arbitrarily prepay for goods or engage in commodity sales on credit. This is because capital construction and fiscal expenditures are used up and not recovered, and the recovery of advance payments for goods and commodity sales on credit takes time. If working capital is used for these aspects, what will guarantee the capital needed for production and commodity circulation? The need for working capital is seasonal. If it is used for other expenses in the season when the working capital seems surplus, what will guarantee it in the season when more working capital is needed? Moreover, this practice not only affects cash balance, but also disrupts the state's unified capital construction plan, impacts market materials, and causes material shortages. This violates the principles of socialist planned economy and cannot be allowed. The main source of working capital is credit funds. In addition to issuing industrial and commercial loans, credit funds must also issue agricultural loans. According to regulations, within the scope of the total amount of loans, the communes can adjust the amount of industrial, agricultural, and commercial loans themselves, but in addition to a portion of small-scale short-term capital construction loans allowed to be issued according to the original regulations, these loans are mainly limited to the use of agricultural, industrial, and commercial working capital. One more point to clarify: after the system is changed, the people's communes should act in accordance with the state's cash management system. The surplus cash of the various units of the commune should be deposited in the commune's credit department, and the surplus cash of the commune's credit department should be deposited in the higher-level bank to ensure the unified adjustment and scheduling of cash throughout the country. The right to issue currency is unified in the state bank, and the commune must never print any disguised currency. In order to reduce procedures, the people's communes can print some meal tickets, barber tickets, and bath tickets within the commune as needed. However, these things are all in the nature of vouchers, and must be strictly distinguished from currency; their use must be limited and they cannot be circulated.

The fundamental principle of improving the rural financial and trade management system is unified leadership and decentralized management. What should be loosened must be loosened to mobilize the enthusiasm of the communes; what should be unified must be unified to maintain the state's planning. The national economy must be a "chessboard." Under unified leadership, all levels should have their own management authority, but this management authority should have certain limits and certain regulations. Some decentralization of power is to better mobilize the masses, improve management, and improve the system, rather than weaken management or weaken the system. At the beginning of the decentralization of institutions, the first problem encountered is whether to "loosen" or not; and after decentralization has been implemented, the problem of whether to "unify" or not becomes more prominent. It is necessary to achieve unification without rigidity, and also to achieve loosening without chaos. Any one-sided understanding of the unified principle of loosening, unification, and contracting is incorrect.

	III. On the Issue of Whether People's Communes Need Economic Accounting

Since the people's commune is a unified economic organization and the entire commune shares profits and losses, is it possible for the various economic departments and business units under the commune not to establish their own financial work and not to conduct separate economic accounting?

Economic accounting, simply put, is to keep accounts and calculate accounts, to use the form of currency to record every economic activity and business process of the commune, to calculate whether the economic activities and business results of the commune are economic, reasonable, and whether it is possible to obtain the greatest results with the least consumption; it is to enable each economic department and business unit to independently engage in business operations within a certain scope, so that they have the responsibility and the necessity to best complete the task, and to care about their own business results from a material interest point of view, in order to give play to everyone's enthusiasm and achieve diligence and frugality in running the commune, careful calculation and strict budgeting, and more, faster, better, and more economically. An individual farmer produces and lives on his own, and it is not impossible not to keep accounts (he always has a plan in his mind); when a mutually cooperative group is initially organized, simple account books must be kept for the group to allocate work; when an agricultural production cooperative is further established, relatively detailed account books and accounting calculations become indispensable. Now that people's communes have been established, our communes range from a few thousand households to tens of thousands of households, and must develop agriculture and industry; develop both self-sufficient production and commodity production; arrange production for commune members and arrange life for commune members; and are both collectively owned and have some elements of ownership by the whole people. In such a large-scale, wide-ranging, and more highly collectivized organization, it is very clear that accounting and accounting must not be weakened in the slightest, but must be greatly strengthened. Marx once said: "The more the process of production takes on a social scale, and loses its purely individual character, the more necessary does book-keeping, as control and ideal synthesis of that process, become. Therefore, book-keeping is far more necessary in capitalist production than in the handicraft and peasant enterprise, and it is still more necessary in collective production than in capitalist production." ("Capital," Volume II, p. 145) The collective production that Marx spoke of refers to socialist production. The reason is very clear. In our commune, if the accounts are not clear, the procedures are not complete, if the work of industry, agriculture, commerce and transportation are not distinguished, production and life are not distinguished, and ownership by the whole people and collective ownership are not distinguished, if each unit only hands over the produced items to the commune and receives the needed items from the commune, but each does not implement revenue and expenditure accounting and does not calculate operating results, if various units use products to each other without calculating money and pricing, then no one knows how much each unit earns, how much it spends, and what the result is. In this way, those who manage well will not be encouraged, those who manage poorly will not find lessons, and problems will not be found. If production does not calculate costs, the use of goods does not calculate money, and loans do not accrue interest, then how can the operating unit calculate costs and maintain turnover? For users, how can they calculate the level of expenditure and the level of consumption? Do not think that since the commune shares profits and losses, the final profit and loss will be calculated uniformly by the commune, and therefore think that since "the meat rots in the pot", calculating accounts or not is the same.

Economic accounting, correctly reflecting the operating conditions of all aspects, can not only make the leading comrades of the commune and various units have a clear understanding, which is conducive to them improving and improving their work, but also enable the commune members to understand the financial situation of the commune and their own unit, and understand the profit and loss situation of the commune and their own unit, which is conducive to them providing necessary assistance and supervision to the work of the commune. Economic accounting, combining the unified leadership of the commune with the graded responsibility of institutions at all levels, combining the unified plan of the commune with the independent operation of various units, and combining communist education with necessary material incentives, makes everyone have a special job, everything is managed, every task is checked, and every operation is explained. This is extremely important for doing a good job in production and operation. People cherish their labor, and people care about the production and management of the commune. With economic accounting, the accounts are clear, and the commune members know what the effect of their production labor is, whether there are shortcomings, and how to improve them. Everyone knows the bottom line, which is conducive to encouraging people's labor enthusiasm and also conducive to gaining the trust of the masses. Of course, the consolidation and improvement of the commune mainly relies on putting politics in command. Political work is the soul of economic work, but doing a good job in economic work is the material basis for doing a good job in political work. It is not to say that with politics in command, economic work is not needed, and economic management system is not needed. Economic accounting is not just an economic issue, a technical issue of keeping accounts, but a major political issue, an issue that concerns whether the commune can well implement the principles of diligence and frugality in running the commune and democratic operation of the commune, and whether it can consolidate and improve.

Economic work must be more and more detailed, not more and more rough. Without the necessary economic accounting, without a close-to-reality understanding of the situation, it will not only be impossible to well encourage the advanced, spur on the backward, and improve labor efficiency and work quality; it will not only be impossible to carefully calculate and rationally arrange the use of manpower, material resources, and financial resources; but the production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation of the commune will not be well planned; the impact of economic accounting on economic work is an objective existence. Paying attention to using it will promote production; not paying attention to using it will hinder production. At the same time, economic accounting is not something mysterious. Some people regard economic accounting as very profound and elusive. In fact, this is a superstition. The old-fashioned account books in China can also reflect economic activities and calculate accounts clearly as long as they are used well. Debit and credit accounting and cash accounting are essentially the same. Therefore, it is good to be able to use Western-style account books, but it is also possible to use Chinese-style account books if you cannot use Western-style account books; if there are conditions, it can be more detailed, and if there are no conditions, it can be simpler. In this regard, it is also necessary to handle things according to the situation.

As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his work "Economic Problems and Financial Problems" that when talking about how to strengthen economic work: economic units must "establish an economic accounting system to overcome the chaotic state within each enterprise." He said: "First, each factory unit should have a reasonably independent fund (current and fixed), so that it can circulate itself, without constantly hindering production due to financial difficulties. Second, the income and expenditure of each factory unit should have a certain system and procedures to end the confused phenomenon of unclear income and expenditure and incomplete procedures. Third, according to the specific circumstances of each factory, some should adopt a cost accounting system, and some should not adopt it temporarily, but all factories must have a calculation of costs. Fourth, the production of each factory should have a system for checking the completion of the annual and monthly production plans, and must not be left to its own devices and not checked for a long time. Fifth, each factory should have a system for saving raw materials and protecting tools, and cultivate the habit of saving raw materials and cherishing tools." He went on to say: "All these are the main contents of economic accounting. Only after a strict accounting system is in place can the operation of an enterprise be thoroughly examined for whether it is beneficial." Although this passage of Comrade Mao Zedong was about factories at that time, it is still completely applicable to the people's communes today.

The economic accounting we are talking about is different from capitalist management. The only purpose of capitalists is to seek profits. They do it if it is profitable, and they do not do it if it is not profitable. They pursue profits and compete freely, resulting in blind production, market crises, and causing huge waste to society. Socialist economic accounting is based on socialist public ownership, and its purpose is to reflect the process of expanded reproduction of enterprises, to conduct necessary assessment and supervision of enterprises, and to promote enterprises to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and serve to accelerate socialist construction. When we say that the commune should strengthen economic accounting, we never mean that the commune can disregard the overall and long-term interests, disregard the state's interests, disregard the requirements of communist cooperation with fraternal communes, and only limit its vision to the circle of its own commune's interests, haggling over whether it is beneficial and whether it is worthwhile. The commune's economic accounting is primarily to better serve the collective interest; but the collective interest must be subordinate to the state's interest. Socialist economic accounting has overall accounting, local accounting, and socialist profits have advanced profits and low-level profits. It is necessary for the local to be subordinate to the overall, and for the immediate interests to be subordinate to the long-term interests. Sometimes an economic organization may have to lose some money on some operating projects, but even if it loses money, it must lose money clearly, and it must be accounted for to see how to do better and lose less.

The establishment and improvement of economic accounting has now attracted the attention of people's communes in various places. Here are a few suggestions to pay attention to: First, all economic activities of the commune must be recorded in the accounts, and all receipts and expenditures of funds and materials must have the necessary procedures, with receipts and evidence. For example, how much grain is harvested must be recorded in the accounts with the warehouse's receipt, and how much money is spent must be recorded in the accounts with the receipt from the spending unit. The original agricultural cooperatives have merged, and the state's financial and trade institutions have been decentralized. The commune needs to establish comprehensive account books, but the original account books of each unit should not be disrupted casually. Second, all units under the commune, including industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation, should uniformly calculate and account for the use of products to each other, and consumer units such as canteens, nurseries, and hospitals should also uniformly calculate and account for the use of materials from the commune's economic units. "Eating without money" does not mean that it is not necessary to calculate how much money it costs to eat. Third, the state's grain warehouses must be separated from the commune's own grain warehouses, the commune's grain warehouses must be separated from the public canteen's grain warehouses, the financial funds must be separated from the credit funds, and the productive expenditures must be separated from the consumer expenditures, so that they can be orderly and act in accordance with normal economic order. Fourth, the management areas (production brigades) and larger industrial, commercial, and transportation units under the commune should become independent accounting units, with their own income and expenditure, and their own delivery plans; non-productive units under the commune should determine an amount of expenditure as much as possible based on certain expenditure standards, and let them be responsible for contracting, and all units with conditions should establish a management responsibility system to facilitate the mobilization of the enthusiasm of these units. Fifth, the commune and the state, and the commune and the commune should widely promote the contract system. Once a contract is concluded, it must be guaranteed to be executed. Sixth, the commune's financial revenue and expenditure should be planned as much as possible, and democratic management should be implemented. The financial plan should be reviewed and approved through appropriate democratic forms, and the implementation of the financial plan should be announced to the commune members regularly in an appropriate form. In order for the higher-level financial and trade departments to understand the situation, the commune should compile and submit reports regularly. Seventh, all financial procedures and financial systems should be clear, easy to understand, simple, and easy to implement.

    怎样认识农村财贸管理体制的改进
    ——应不应“放”？要不要“统”？人民公社是否要经济核算？
    李先念
      “两放、三统、一包”，是国家适应人民公社发展的形势，改进农村财政贸易管理体制的办法的概括的说法。所谓两放，就是下放人员、下放资产；所谓三统，就是统一政策、统一计划、统一流动资金的管理；所谓一包，就是包财政任务。总起来说，就是：一方面国家把农村财贸机构下放给人民公社，由公社管理经营，另一方面公社又必须按照国家统一政策和统一计划办事；一方面农村财贸机构的收入由公社去收，另一方面公社又必须把自己整个收入中一个适当的部分，经过财政收入的渠道包干上交给国家。“两放、三统、一包”是统一的不可分割的整体。放，是在统的前提下放的，放并不等于放手不管；统，是在放的基础上统的，统并不排斥公社应有的机动性和主动精神。放，才能更好地发挥人民公社的积极性，更好地使财贸工作为公社的生产服务；统，才能更好地保证国家的集中领导，适应社会主义计划经济的要求。放和统是对立的统一，是民主集中制在农村财贸工作方面的具体运用，而财政包干则是在放和统的原则下国家和公社财政关系的反映。农村财贸管理体制作这样的改进，正如中共中央和国务院“关于适应人民公社化的形势改进农村财政贸易管理体制的决定”中所说：“既可以保证国家各项财政经济政策的全面贯彻，又有利于人民公社在执行政策的条件下机动地处理业务；既可以保证国家统一计划的执行，又有利于人民公社对工农商学兵各方面活动作全面的管理和安排；既可以保证国家的财政收入，又有利于充分发挥人民公社发展生产增加积累的积极性。”
    实行两放三统一包的办法，是农村财贸管理体制上一项重大的改进，是一个新的问题。因此，在财贸工作人员和其他干部当中，对于这个改进可能有这样那样的看法：可能产生思想落后于实际的保守主义的想法，怀疑放了是不是好；可能产生不顾全局的本位主义的想法，怀疑既然放了是不是需要那样统；也可能产生一种简单的想法，认为人民公社既然共负盈亏，公社内部是不是还需要经济核算。看来，把这类问题彻底弄清楚，对于统一思想、做好工作，是必要的。
      一、关于应不应放的问题
    农村财贸管理体制，是国家管理农村财贸工作的一种根本制度。它规定国家财贸部门同人民公社财贸机构的工作关系和职权范围，从而规定国家同公社之间在财政贸易方面的关系。在开始实行新的农村财贸管理体制的时候，首先碰到的问题，是应不应该放的问题。有的同志怀疑，把国家的财贸机构下放给人民公社，是不是全民所有制向集体所有制后退了一步？人民公社能不能把财贸工作做好？干部下放以后，由国家的工作人员变成公社的工作人员，是不是地位降低了，等等。这些怀疑所反映的共同问题，就是对人民公社性质如何认识，以及是否相信党和相信群众的问题。
    应当这样来看：由农业生产合作社到人民公社的转变，这个事实本身就使原有的集体所有制扩大了和提高了，并且带上了若干全民所有制的成分。把国家基层财贸机构下放给人民公社，是下放管理和使用权限，不能了解为所有权的改变。这些机构下放以后，一方面成为人民公社的组成部分，同时又是国家财贸部门的基层单位；一方面归人民公社经营管理，一方面仍然属于全民所有。因此，这种下放实际上是增加了人民公社的全民所有制成分。这些机构下放以后，国家财贸部门还要继续进行业务领导，也将要通过人民公社对农村财贸工作进行具体领导。因此，这种下放可以说更加加强了国家对人民公社的领导。也正因为这样，就更加便于人民公社向全民所有制过渡。这不是后退，而是前进。
    应当这样来看：人民公社是在党的领导之下的。党的领导包括中央、省委、地委和县委的领导，也包括公社党委的领导在内。对于各级财贸业务部门来说，依靠党的领导，首先是依靠同级党委的领导。党能够领导政治，领导军事，领导工农业生产，而且领导得那么好，难道唯独财贸工作领导不好吗？人民公社是建立在广大群众思想觉悟提高的基础之上的，经过土地改革、农业合作化、人民公社化，共产主义觉悟大大提高了的群众，他们有办法也有力量克服各种困难，保证农村财贸工作比过去做得更好，而不至作坏。人民公社是生产大跃进的产物，它的建立将进一步推动生产力的迅速发展；在生产发展的基础上，商品流通会进一步扩大，国家的财政收入会更有保证，农村财贸工作一定可以做得更好。当然，开始下放时，由于经验不足，个别地方个别环节出现一时的脱节现象是可能的。但是只要引起注意，依靠党的领导，依靠群众力量，采取措施，这种脱节现象就可以防止和纠正。
    应当这样来看：经过人民公社这个组织形式，加速社会主义建设，并且逐步向共产主义过渡，正是我们共产主义者的伟大理想，公社社员的称号正是我们革命干部引为光荣的称号。我们将来要逐步做到既是体力劳动者，又是脑力劳动者，既是干部，又是一个普通劳动者。每一个革命干部都应当朝着这个理想前进。现在的公社已经实行了政社合一，是国家政权组织的一部分，公社的干部，也是国家的干部。在将来，随着基层公社的巩固和联社的成立，随着城市的逐步人民公社化，大多数国家干部也同时会是公社的干部。因此，每一个具有高度共产主义觉悟的革命干部，都应当欢迎这种下放，并且在下放以后同广大社员群众一起，鼓足干劲，开动脑筋，把财贸工作做好。我们应当向前看，不能向后看，应当往大处看，不要只是斤斤计较个人的得失。
    根据最近若干地方开始实行的经验来看，财贸机构下放归公社管理，好处很多，初步分析至少有以下三条：第一，公社工农商业各方面的关系更加密切了，财政、商业、信用从组织上成为公社整个经济活动的一个部分，过去是两家，现在成为一家了，这样就能够更密切地配合工农业生产的发展，有利于人民公社的巩固和提高。第二，财贸机构下放，归公社党委统一领导，把财贸工作放在公社党委的统盘安排全面规划的范围以内，基层党委对财贸工作的领导加强了，这就有利于财贸工作同其他工作相互协作，共同跃进，全面发展。第三，财贸机构下放，财贸工作和群众的关系更直接了，广大社员群众对财贸工作更关心了，这就有利于群众的进一步帮助和监督。国家要收购什么，运输什么，销售上有什么问题，党委一说话，群众一动员，什么困难都比较容易解决。财贸工作人员在工作中有了缺点，有了问题，群众也会以更大的责任感，帮助他们改正和解决。有什么理由怀疑下放的正确和必要呢？
      二、关于要不要统的问题
    改进农村财贸管理体制，把国家在农村的财贸机构下放给人民公社，这是不是说，人民公社可以自由地进行商业活动，可以依靠商业赚钱来增加收入？是不是说，人民公社可以随意地变动商品价格？是不是说，人民公社可以把下放的流动资金随便使用于其他用途？这些疑问也反映了一个共同的问题，就是对于在下放的基础上实行“三统”的必要性如何认识的问题，就是对于社会主义经济必须实行统一领导、计划管理这样一条重要的原则如何认识的问题。
    人民公社是有着高度的组织性和计划性的综合组织。公社建立以后，自由市场基本上不存在了。农村商业机构的下放，应当有利于国家对市场管理的加强，有利于财贸工作计划性的加强，而不能削弱市场管理和计划管理。按照规定，人民公社对于统购、统一收购的物资和其他重要物资，需要出卖的应当卖给上级商业机构，需要购买的应当向上级商业机构购买，不得在公社之间自行交易，也不得到远地进行交易；人民公社不得从社外购买物资转卖给国家，也不得把从国家商业机构买来的物资转卖给社外，不能转手经营；人民公社需要出售一些次要产品和零星产品，需要购买一些特殊商品，上级商业机构不能收购和供应的，可以在上级商业机构的领导下，同其他公社订立合同进行交流，也可以经过批准，到适当的地方去采购和推销。我们社会主义所以比资本主义优越，重要的一条就是实行计划经济。生产有计划，流通也有计划。资本主义经济靠价值法则的自发作用，通过盲目的自由竞争调节市场供需。社会主义经济则可以依靠计划的调整和安排取得平衡。把农村财贸机构下放给人民公社，是为了便于公社统一领导，便于更好地为公社的生产和社员的消费服务，而不是为了让公社通过商业经营，赚取商业利润。人民公社要增加社内积累和社员收入，唯一的办法是增加生产，改善经营，节约开支，而不能从商业利润方面打主意，不能把应当属于国家的收入，转作自己的收入，不能违反国家的有关规定，超出正常的范围。可以这样设想：如果允许公社随便到什么地方，随便和什么人去交易，不按照国家市场管理的原则办事，其结果必然要打乱国家商品流转计划，造成混乱现象。这样做，就一个局部来看，也许会多赚一点钱；但从全局来看，则会造成很大的浪费，形成自由市场，动摇社会主义计划经济。
    商品价格是调节国家积累和个人消费、调节生产者利益和消费者利益的一个重要工具。国家在规定商品价格时，需要照顾多方面的因素。既要考虑品种差价，即是这种商品价格多少，那种商品价格多少；又要考虑地区差价，即是这个地区价格多少，那个地区价格多少；还要考虑购销差价，即是买进价格多少，卖出价格多少。各种差价都是按照具体情况规定下来的。价格稳定是市场稳定的一个重要方面。一种商品价格变动了，会影响其他商品；一个地区的价格变动了，会影响其他地区；不适当地变动价格，又会严重地影响生产者和消费者的利益。如果价格不由国家统一领导和掌握，允许随便抬价降价，谁出的价钱大，卖给谁，谁的东西便宜，向谁买，大家都这样做，试问将给市场引来怎样的后果呢？因此，按照规定，公社向国家交售农副产品，必须执行国家规定的收购价格；公社销售从国家批发的商品，必须执行国家规定的零售价格；公社自己生产的产品，在社内销售或者同外社进行交流的时候，有国家规定价格的，应当执行国家的规定；国家没有规定价格的，应当参照国家规定的同类商品的价格适当确定。公社对于国家规定的商品价格，无权自己变动。我们说不能随意变动商品价格，并不是说情况已经变化，某些商品价格确实不合理了，也不作必要的调整，而是说这种调整必须按照物价管理体制的规定，经过各级有关部门批准。对于不合理的价格，公社可以提出意见。
    流动资金是工商企业用于生产和商品流转的资金，是用来购买原料、购买货物的，钱出去，货回来，货出去，钱回来，经常维持周转，保证生产和流通的正常进行。国家对流动资金的管理有这样几条界限：流动资金一般不能用于基本建设开支，不能用于财政支出；除了特别批准的以外，不能用来随意预付货款，也不能进行商品赊销。因为基本建设和财政开支是用出去不收回的，预付货款和商品赊销，要收回货物和钱，需要一个时间。如果把流动资金用于这些方面，生产和商品流转所需要的资金靠什么来保证呢？流动资金的需要是有季节性的，在流动资金显得有余的季节，用来作了其他方面的开支，到了需要流动资金较多的季节，靠什么来保证呢？而且这种作法不仅影响现金平衡，还会打破国家统一的基本建设计划，冲击市场物资，造成物资紧张。这是违反社会主义计划经济的原则的，是不能允许的。流动资金的主要来源是信贷资金，信贷资金除了发放工商业贷款以外，还要发放农业货款。按照规定，公社在贷款总数的范围以内，工业、农业、商业贷款各用多少，可以自行调剂，但是这种贷款除了根据原有规定允许发放的一部分小型的短期的基本建设贷款以外，主要也还是限于农业、工业和商业流动资金的用途。还有一点要说清楚：体制改变以后，人民公社应当按照国家的现金管理制度办事，公社各单位多余的现金要存到公社信用部，公社信用部多余的现金要存到上级银行，以保证全国现金的统一调剂和调度。货币的发行权统一于国家银行，公社绝对不能印发任何变相的货币。人民公社为了减少手续，可以按照需要在社内印发一些饭票、理发票、洗澡票。但是这些东西都属于凭证的性质，必须同货币严格区别开来；必须限定用途，不能流通。
    改进农村财贸管理体制的根本原则是统一领导、分级管理。应当放的必须放，以调动公社的积极性；应当统的必须统，以保持国家的计划性。全国经济必须是“一盘棋”。在统一领导下，各级应当有自己的机动管理权限；但这种机动管理权限又应当有一定的限度，有一定的章程。某些权力下放是为了更好地发动群众，改善管理，改进制度，而不是削弱管理，削弱制度。在开始机构下放的时候，首先遇到的问题是应不应该“放”的问题；而在已经实行了下放以后，要不要“统”的问题就比较突出了。要做到统而不死，也要做到放而不乱。对放、统、包这样一条统一的方针，作任何片面的了解，都是不对的。
    三、关于人民公社是否需要经济
        核算的问题
    人民公社既是一个统一的经济组织，全社共负盈亏，公社所属各个经济部门和经营单位是不是可以不必建立自己的财务工作，不必分别进行经济核算了呢？
    经济核算，简单地说就是要记账算账，要用货币的形式，记载公社的每一个经济活动和经营过程，计算公社的经济活动和经营成果是否经济，是否合理，是否尽可能以最小的消耗取得最大的成果；就是要使每一个经济部门和经营单位能够在一定的范围内，独立地从事业务经营，使他们有责任也有必要来最好地完成任务，并且从物质利益上关心自己的经营成果，以便发挥大家的积极性，做到勤俭办社，精打细算，多快好省。一个个体农民自己生产，自己过日子，不记账未尝不可（他自己心中总还有个打算）；初步组织起来的互助组，组里要拨工换工，就必须有简单的账簿记载；进一步成立了农业生产合作社，比较详细的账簿和会计计算就成为必不可少的了。现在建立了人民公社，我们的公社小的有几千户，大的有几万户，既要发展农业，又要发展工业；既要发展自给性生产，又要发展商品性生产；既要安排社员生产，又要安排社员生活；既是集体所有制，又具有若干全民所有制成分。在这样一个规模大、范围广、集体化程度更高的组织里，很显然，记账和核算决不可以有丝毫削弱，而必须大大加强。马克思曾经说过：“生产过程愈采取社会的规模，愈失去纯粹个人的性质，簿记——当作生产过程的控制和观念总结——就愈成为必要。所以，簿记对于资本主义生产，比它对于手工业经营及自耕农经营的分散的生产，更为必要；它对于社会共同的生产，又比它对于资本主义生产，更为必要。”（“资本论”第二卷，第145页）马克思说的共同生产，就是指社会主义的生产。道理很明白，在我们的公社里，如果账目不清楚，手续不完备，如果工农商交不分，生产和生活不分，全民所有和集体所有不分，如果每一个单位只是把生产的东西交给公社，需要的东西向公社领，但各自不实行收支核算，不计算经营成果，如果各个单位之间互相使用产品，不算钱计价，那么，各个单位到底收入多少，用掉多少，结果如何，谁也不知道，这样，经营得好的得不到鼓励，经营得不好的找不出教训，发生了毛病也查不出来。如果生产不计成本，用货不算钱，贷款不出息，这对于经营单位来说，怎样计算成本，怎样维持周转呢？对于使用者来说，怎样计算开支水平和消费水平呢？不能以为公社共负盈亏了，最后的赔赚将要统一由公社计算了，因而就认为反正“肉烂在锅里”，算账不算账都是一样。
    实行经济核算，正确地反映各方面的经营情况，不仅可以使公社和各单位的领导同志心中有数，有利于他们改进和提高工作，而且可以使社员群众了解公社和本单位的财务状况，了解公社和本单位的盈亏情况，有利于他们对公社工作进行必要的帮助和监督。实行经济核算，把公社的统一领导和各级机构的分级负责结合起来，把公社的统一计划和各个单位的独立经营结合起来，把进行共产主义教育和必要的物质鼓励结合起来，使人人有专职，事事有人管，使每件工作都有检查，每项经营都有交代。这对于搞好生产经营有着极其重要的意义。人们是珍惜自己的劳动的，人们都关心公社的生产和经营管理。有了经济核算，账目一清二楚，社员群众知道自己所从事的生产劳动到底效果如何，有无缺点，如何改进，大家都摸底，就有利于鼓励人们的劳动热情，也有利于取得群众的信赖。当然，公社的巩固和提高主要是靠政治挂帅。政治工作是经济工作的灵魂，但是做好经济工作又是做好政治工作的物质基础。并不是说有了政治挂帅，就不要经济工作了，就不要经济管理制度了。经济核算不只是一个经济问题，一个记账算账的技术问题，而且是一个重大的政治问题，是一个关乎公社能否很好地贯彻勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，能否巩固和提高的问题。
    经济工作必须越作越细致，而不是越做越粗糙。没有必要的经济核算，没有对情况的接近实际的了解，不仅不能很好地鼓励先进，鞭策落后，提高劳动效率和工作质量；不仅人力物力财力的使用不可能精打细算，合理安排；而且公社的生产、交换、消费和积累就不可能很好地有计划地进行；经济核算对经济工作的影响，是一种客观存在，注意运用它，就会起促进生产的作用；不注意运用它，就会起妨碍生产的作用。同时，经济核算并不是怎样神秘的事情。有些人把经济核算看得好像很深奥，不可捉摸，其实这是一种迷信。中国过去的老式账簿，只要运用得好，也可以反映经济活动，也可以把账算得清清楚楚。借贷会计和收付会计实质上都是一样。因此，能用西式账簿的固然好，不能用西式账簿的也可以用中式账簿；有条件的可以详细一些，没有条件的可以简单一些。在这方面也要看情况办事。
    毛泽东同志早在抗日战争时期，在“经济问题与财政问题”这个著作中谈到如何加强经济工作的时候，就曾经指出：经济单位必须“建立经济核算制，克服各企业内部的混乱状态”。他说：“第一，每一工厂单位应有相当独立的资金（流动的和固定的），使它可以自己周转，而不致经常因资金困难妨碍生产。第二，每一工厂单位的收入和支出，应有一定的制度和手续，结束收支不清，手续不备的糊涂现象。第三，依照各厂具体情况，使有些采取成本会计制，有些则暂不采取，但一切工厂必须有成本的计算。第四，每一工厂的生产，应有按年按月生产计划完成程度的检查制度，不得听其自流，很久不去检查。第五，每一工厂应有节省原料与保护工具的制度，养成节省原料与爱护工具的习惯。”他接着说：“所有这些就是经济核算的主要内容。有了严格的核算制度之后，才能彻底考查一个企业的经营是否是有利的。”毛泽东同志当时这一段话，虽然是说工厂的，但今天看来，也完全适用于人民公社。
    我们所说的经济核算，同资本主义的经营不同。资本家唯一的目的是谋取利润，有利就干，无利不干。他们追逐利润，自由竞争，结果引来盲目生产，市场危机，造成社会的巨大浪费。社会主义经济核算是建立在社会主义公有制基础之上的，它的目的是为了反映企业扩大再生产的过程，为了对企业进行必要的考核和监督，促使企业提高劳动生产率，降低成本，为加速社会主义建设服务。我们说公社应当加强经济核算，绝不是说公社可以不顾整体的长远的利益，不顾国家利益，不顾同兄弟公社进行共产主义协作的要求，而只是把眼光仅仅局限在自己一个公社利益的圈子里，斤斤计较对自己是否有利，是否合算。公社进行经济核算首先是为了更好地服务于集体利益；但是集体利益又必须服从国家的利益。社会主义经济核算有整体的核算，有局部的核算，社会主义的赢利有高级的赢利，有低级的赢利。必须局部服从整体，眼前利益服从长远利益。一个经济组织有时候在一些经营项目上是可能要赔些钱的，但即使是赔钱，也要赔得一清二楚，也要核算，要看怎样作得更好，赔得更少。
    建立和健全经济核算这件事，现在已经引起了各地人民公社的注意。这里建议注意以下几点：第一，公社的一切经济活动都要记账，一切款项和实物的收支都要有必要的手续，要有凭有证。比如，收获了多少粮食，要凭仓库的入库收据记账，开支了多少钱，要凭开支单位的领条记账。原来的农业合作社合并了，国家的财贸机构下放了，公社需要建立综合性的账簿，但各单位原有的账簿，不要随便去打乱。第二，公社所属工农商交各个单位相互使用产品，应当一律计价核算，食堂、托儿所、卫生院等消费单位使用公社各经济单位的物资，也应当一律计价算钱。“吃饭不要钱”，不等于不需要计算吃饭花多少钱。第三，国家的粮食仓库要同公社自己的粮食仓库分清，公社的粮食仓库要同公共食堂的粮食仓库分清，财政资金要同信贷资金分清，生产性开支要同消费性开支分清，这样才能有条不紊，按照正常的经济秩序办事。第四，公社所属管理区（生产大队）和较大的工业、商业、交通运输单位，应当成为独立的核算单位，有它自己的收入和支出，有它自己的上交计划；公社所属非生产性单位，要尽可能根据一定的开支标准，确定一个开支数额，让他们负责包干，一切有条件的单位都应当建立管理责任制度，以利于发挥这些单位的积极性。第五，公社同国家、公社同公社之间应当广泛地推行合同制度，合同一经订定，必须保证执行。第六，公社财务收支要尽可能做到有计划，并且实行民主管理。财务计划要经过适当的民主形式审查批准，财务计划的执行情况，要以适当的形式定期向社员公布。为了让上级财贸部门了解情况，公社应当定期地编送报表。第七，一切财务手续和财务制度应当注意清楚易懂，简便易行。
