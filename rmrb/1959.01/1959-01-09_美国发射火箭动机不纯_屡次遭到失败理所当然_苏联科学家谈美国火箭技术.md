Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: TASS reports that Soviet space travel expert Academician Blagonravov wrote in the Soviet "New Times" weekly, saying that the United States' attempts to overcome Earth's gravity with rockets have repeatedly failed due to the environmental conditions faced by American scientists and engineers.

Blagonravov pointed out that some people are desperately chasing them, presenting them with goals that have little in common with science.

He said, "After the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, the United States intensified its work in astronautics with particular frenzy. Obviously, many things were done in a hurry. Political and military leaders demanded that scientists and engineers, at all costs, salvage the lost face for the Stars and Stripes and convince the world of the United States' technological superiority."

Blagonravov said, "However, in this nervous, artificially tense environment fueled by the arms race, it is difficult for scientific workers and technical experts to work. In my opinion, this is the reason for the frequent failures."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet Deputy Doctor of Physics and Mathematics Kroshkin published an article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on the 4th, comparing the Soviet lunar rocket with the American so-called "lunar" rocket, powerfully demonstrating that the Soviet Union's achievements in this area far exceeded those of the United States.

Kroshkin said that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite had already shown that Soviet rockets were fully capable of reaching the moon. Simple calculations show that the thrust of the rocket used to launch the first satellite was already greater than that of the rocket the United States intended to use to send to the moon. However, reaching the moon is not that simple. First, it is necessary to calculate the orbit of an object moving under the influence of more than just one planet's gravity. On this point, the American official statement that the American "Pioneer 1" rocket had left the Earth's gravitational range is completely wrong. The success of the Soviet Union in launching rockets to the lunar region is a brilliant achievement.

Kroshkin said that the difference between Soviet and American rockets also lies in the scope of their investigations. The American "Pioneer 1" only investigated the intensity of cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and meteors. Even some American scientists themselves expressed doubts about the results of the investigation. The American "Pioneer 3" had an even smaller range of investigation, with only one instrument for studying the intensity of cosmic rays. The scope of the Soviet cosmic rocket's investigation is much larger, and the work of receiving and recording the rocket's radio signals is progressing very smoothly. All of this proves the scientific effectiveness of the Soviet cosmic experiment.

    苏联科学家谈美国火箭技术
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联星际交通专家布拉冈拉沃夫院士在苏联“新时代”周刊撰文说，美国利用火箭克服地球引力的尝试之所以屡遭失败，是由于美国科学家和工程师所处的环境条件造成的。
    布拉冈拉沃夫指出，一些人拼命追赶他们，向他们提出同科学很少共同之处的目的。
    他说，“在苏联发射第一个卫星以后，美国就以特别狂热的速度在宇宙航行学方面加紧工作。显然，许多事情是做得很匆忙的，政界和军界领导人要求科学家和工程师们无论如何要为星条旗挽回已经失去的面子，让世界相信美国的技术优势。”
    布拉冈拉沃夫说，“但是，在这种神经质的、被军备竞赛所煽热的人为紧张环境中，科学工作者和技术专家是很难工作的。在我看来，这就是经常失败的原因所在。”
    据新华社讯　苏联物理数学副博士克罗什金4日在“共青团真理报”上发表文章，比较了苏联月球火箭和美国的所谓“月球”火箭的不同，有力地表明苏联这方面的成就远远超过了美国。
    克罗什金说，苏联第一个人造卫星发射成功，就已经表明了，苏联火箭完全有能力达到月球。根据简单计算表明，发射第一个卫星使用的火箭所具有的推力，就已经比美国打算用来发往月球的火箭大了。但是，要达到月球还不是那么简单的。首先必须计算出不只是在一个行星引力作用下的运行的物体的轨道。就这一点上说，美国官方所发布的美国“先驱者一号”火箭已离地球引力范围的说法是完全错误的。苏联向月球区域发射火箭所获得的成功是光辉的成就。
    克罗什金说，苏美火箭的不同还在于两者考察的范围。美国“先驱者一号”考察的只是宇宙射线强度、磁场和流星。考察的结果连某些美国科学家自己也表示怀疑。美国“先驱者三号”考察范围更小，上面仅有一部研究宇宙射线强度的仪器。而苏联宇宙火箭考察范围要大得多，而且接收和记录火箭无线电讯号的工作进行得非常顺利。这一切都证明了苏联宇宙实验的科学上的有效性。
