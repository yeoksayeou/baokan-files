　　This dispatch from Hangzhou, January 14th: More than thirty People's Communes in Ningbo City and the Yuyao, Zhenhai, Yin County, and other areas of the Ningbo Special District in Zhejiang Province are producing a large quantity of indigenous machine tool equipment.

　　In the twenty-odd days from mid-November to early December, the entire district produced more than 2,400 units of various indigenous machine tools. These included not only general lathes, drilling machines, grinding machines, planers, and milling machines, but also large gantry planers, milling machines, horizontal boring machines, and indigenous boring machines weighing several tons. There were also light and delicate small planers, small grinding machines, specialized lathes, and sawing machines. After the People's Commune machinery factories were equipped with these various types of indigenous machine tools, they could not only perform simple mechanical repairs and maintenance for agriculture, but also manufacture new farm tools and perform relatively complex industrial processing.

　　Most of these indigenous machine tools are made from substitutes, waste products, and old materials, so the cost is low, the production is fast, and the quality is not poor. Many commune machinery factories are also using indigenous machine tools to produce more machine tools. The Zhenhai County Universal Machinery Factory is now using a small planer to manufacture a sixteen-foot large lathe. Many People's Commune machinery factories have used indigenous machine tools to manufacture large quantities of farm tools such as hoes, iron rakes, shovels, and tools such as vegetable cutting machines and sweet potato shredders. The Five-Star People's Commune in Yuyao County, after establishing a universal machinery factory by manufacturing thirty-two indigenous machine tools, has already made more than 300 hoes, iron rakes, sickles, scrapers, and other farm tools for the commune. During the rapeseed loosening period, the machinery factory also rushed to make dozens of small and flexible small hoes in one day, greatly improving labor efficiency.

　　When the People's Communes in the Ningbo Special District began to vigorously develop indigenous machine tools, some cadres and the masses had feelings of fear and difficulty. They said: "Without raw materials, without technology, and without drawings, how can we make machines?" To this end, many People's Communes mobilized the masses to launch a free and open debate, and came up with many methods to overcome their fear of difficulty. After the great debate, the People's Communes implemented the "small-scale indigenous groups" policy and quickly launched a vigorous campaign to develop indigenous machine tools. In the process of manufacturing indigenous machine tools, workers used indigenous methods to overcome many difficulties. They used hand drills, pliers, files, and other tools, and used various available forces as power, to manufacture a large number of indigenous machine tools.

　　The People's Communes paid great attention to solving technical problems in production during the vigorous campaign to develop indigenous machine tools. They universally adopted the method of combining leaders, technicians, and three craftsmen (blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and carpenters) to run training classes. They used the technical workers from the county's agricultural machinery factory as technicians, learning and manufacturing machine tools at the same time, and studying problems at any time to vigorously overcome technical barriers.

　　The original mechanical industrial base in the Ningbo Special District was relatively weak. Only a few cities and towns had some broken and dilapidated old machine tools. Most People's Communes had no mechanical equipment or technical strength. Now, the machinery factories of the People's Communes in the Ningbo Special District are continuing to arm themselves.

### 自造机器设备  武装公社工厂  宁波专区人民公社大兴土法

    宁波专区人民公社大兴土法
    本报杭州14日电　浙江省宁波市和宁波专区的余姚、镇海、鄞县等地三十多个人民公社大量自造土机床设备。
    从11月中旬到12月上旬的二十多天内，全区已生产了各种土机床二千四百多台，其中不仅有一般的车床、钻床、磨床、刨床和铣床，还有重达几吨的大型牛头刨床、龙门刨床、铣床、横臂床和土镗床等，而且还有轻便精巧的小刨床、小磨床、专用车床和锯床。当人民公社的机械厂被这些各式各样的土机床装备起来以后，不仅在农业上可以进行简单的机械修配，还可以进行新农具制造和比较复杂的工业加工。
    这些土机床大多数是利用代用品和废品旧料做成的，因此成本低、做得快、而质量又不差。许多公社机械厂还用土机床再生产机床。镇海县通用机械厂现在正在用小刨床制造十六尺的大车床。许多人民公社的机械厂已用土机床制造了大批锄头、铁耙、洋锹等农具和切菜机、甘薯刨丝机等工具。余姚县五星人民公社自己制造了三十二台土机床建立通用机械厂后，已给公社做了三百多把锄头、铁耙、毛刀、刮子等农具，在油菜地松土时期，机械厂还在一天内赶制了几十把小巧灵便的小锄头，大大提高了劳动效率。
    宁波专区各个人民公社开始大搞土机床时，部分干部和群众存在着畏难情绪，他们说：一无原料、二无技术、三无图纸，怎么能造机器呢？为此很多人民公社发动群众展开鸣放辩论，想出了很多方法，克服了畏难思想。大辩论以后，各个人民公社贯彻了小土群的方针，迅速开展大搞土机床运动，在制造土机床过程中，工人用土办法冲破了重重困难，他们用摇钻、老虎钳、锉刀等工具，利用各种可用的力量作动力，制造出了大批土机床。
    各个人民公社在大搞土机床运动中非常注意解决生产中的技术问题，他们普遍采取领导、技术员、三匠（铁匠、铜匠、木匠）三结合的办法开办训练班，以县的农业机械厂技术工人作技术员，边学习，边制造机床，有问题随时研究，猛攻技术关。
    宁波专区原来的机械工业基础较差，只有几个市、镇有些破破烂烂的旧机床，绝大部分人民公社都没有机械设备和技术力量。现在宁波专区各人民公社的机械厂正在继续武装自己。
