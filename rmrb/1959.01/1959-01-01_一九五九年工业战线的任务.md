The year 1958 saw great victories in China's socialist construction. In that year, the development of socialist industrialization far outstripped any previous year.

According to current estimates, industrial production in 1958 increased by about 65% compared to 1957. Among the major industrial products, steel more than doubled, reaching about 11 million tons. Driven by the steel industry, machine tools more than doubled, reaching about 90,000 units; coal more than doubled, reaching about 270 million tons; and electricity increased by more than 42%, reaching about 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours. With the rapid development of heavy industry, light industry also grew significantly, with cotton yarn increasing by 43%, reaching about 6.8 million bales. The leap forward in China's national economy in 1958, and the leaps forward in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, stood in stark contrast to the economic crisis in the Western world. This contrast filled the people of the whole country with confidence in the realization of the tasks of developing China's socialist construction at high speed, rapidly changing the face of the country, and quickly surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products.

The great victory achieved by China on the industrial front in 1958 was due to many factors, but ultimately to the fact that, on the basis of the rectification movement, conservative ideas were conscientiously opposed, superstitions were eliminated, and the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism was conscientiously implemented. The practice of the past year has further proved that the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" is completely correct. The policy of "walking on two legs" means: on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous development of heavy and light industry, the simultaneous development of central and local industry, the simultaneous development of large and small and medium-sized enterprises, the simultaneous development of foreign and indigenous methods of production, the combination of centralized leadership and mass movement on the industrial front, and the combination of steel as the key link and overall leap forward in the current period. This whole set of policies correctly reflects China's actual conditions and the requirements of objective economic laws, and therefore they have demonstrated strong vitality in practice. Further implementing this set of policies, we will not only be able to continue to leap forward in 1959, but also be able to leap forward even better.

On the basis of the great leap forward in China's industry in 1958, an even more magnificent goal will be achieved in 1959. According to the 1959 plan targets proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, China's industrial production will continue to develop at roughly the same speed as in 1958, and the absolute increase in the output of most industrial products will also be greater or about the same as in 1958. For example, steel increased by more than 5 million tons from 1957 to 1958, and coal increased by more than 140 million tons; while steel will increase by about 7 million tons from 1958 to 1959, and coal will increase by more than 110 million tons. The absolute increase in the output of many other heavy and light industrial products will also be very large. By realizing the 1959 plan, China will respectively approach, catch up with, or surpass Britain in the output of products such as steel, iron, copper, aluminum, machine tools, and power generation equipment. As for coal and cotton textiles, as everyone knows, they have already surpassed Britain in 1958.

It can be seen from this that the 1959 industrial development plan is still a plan for a great leap forward, a plan for achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and a plan of decisive significance during the three years of hard struggle. People have already seen in 1958 that it took China only one year to increase steel production from more than 5 million tons to 11 million tons; while the history of industrial development in the major capitalist countries shows that it took Britain 32 years, the United States 7 years, and Japan 20 years. People will also see in 1959 that China's steel production will increase from 11 million tons to 18 million tons; while the same growth process took 5 or 6 years in the United States and 18 years in Britain. In old China, the highest annual steel production was only more than 900,000 tons. In the ten years after liberation, China will increase steel production by 20 times; and the increase of about 7 million tons in 1959 alone is roughly equal to eight times the highest annual production in old China. It can also be seen from this that, whether compared with the history of major capitalist countries or with the history of our country, the growth rate of steel in 1959 is very fast. Of course, for a large country like ours with a population of 600 million, an annual output of 18 million tons of steel is far from enough to meet our needs; however, from the speed of steel production growth in 1958 and the speed of steel production growth to be achieved in 1959, it can be seen that the high modernization of China's industry does not require such a long road as in capitalist countries, nor does it require as much time as we had previously imagined, is this not becoming increasingly clear?

So, is it possible to realize this leap forward plan? We believe that not only can it be realized, but it can also be overfulfilled.

Because this plan target was put forward after fully estimating objective possibilities. Taking steel production as an example, calculated by production capacity, the steelmaking capacity of China's 18 key steel enterprises can reach about 16 million tons in 1959, and the steelmaking capacity of the 24 medium-sized steel plants under construction and the current main machinery plants can reach about 6 million tons, and the capacity of other small steel furnaces has not yet been calculated. There is also complete certainty in supplying the pig iron needed for steelmaking; the coke, washed coal, ferroalloys, and refractory materials needed for steelmaking and ironmaking can also be resolved after increasing the necessary equipment; and the steel rolling equipment capacity can also ensure that steel can be made into finished products. Other heavy industry departments, especially the power and transportation departments, will also be able to develop proportionally. At the same time, due to the bumper harvest in agriculture in 1958, we will be able to correspondingly develop the production and basic construction of light industry (mainly the textile and paper industries, etc.) to meet the growing needs of the people's lives.

Of course, to realize the great leap forward plan for industry in 1959, it is by no means an easy task, and we may encounter various difficulties. We must despise difficulties strategically, and we must pay attention to difficulties tactically. We must draw lessons from the rich practice of 1958, improve our understanding, continue to go all out, aim high, and, through tremendous efforts and heroic labor, completely realize the 1959 plan.

The practice of 1958 proved that eliminating superstitions and emancipating the mind played a great role in promoting the rapid development of China's socialist construction. Everyone has already seen that when the broad masses of cadres and workers responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to emancipate their minds, establish a Marxist-Leninist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and broke down various superstitions and outdated rules and regulations that hindered industrial development, many miracles appeared on the industrial front. Not only did the speed of industrial development increase day by day, but industry also blossomed everywhere in cities and villages. In order to prepare conditions from the spiritual aspect to meet new and greater victories, we should continue to eliminate superstitions and emancipate our minds. The process of ideological emancipation is the process of understanding the objective world. The objective world is constantly developing and changing. In order to prevent our thinking from becoming rigid and falling behind the objective situation, we must constantly eliminate superstitions, emancipate our minds, abandon old concepts, and accept new things in practice, so that our understanding can improve step by step with the development and change of the objective world. Ideological emancipation and seeking truth from facts should and must be unified in practice. Ideological emancipation does not mean that we should not study the objective world and violate objective economic laws; but that we should enable our thinking to correctly or more correctly reflect the objective world, and enable our understanding to better conform to the objective requirements of economic laws. Marxists are people who pursue truth, and are bold and careful people. We dare to eliminate all superstitions, and at the same time, we must respect science, diligently study all sciences, and adopt a scientific attitude to treat and solve all problems in economic construction.

To realize a certain economic task, it is not only necessary to fully mobilize the revolutionary drive of the people, but also to have the necessary material and technical conditions. Only seeing things and not people, absolutizing the role of material and technical conditions, believing that people can only be dominated by them, failing to see or acknowledge that people are the most active factor in production, and neglecting people's subjective initiative, thus failing to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, is a right-leaning conservative error. In 1958, it was precisely because we criticized and overcame this erroneous tendency and greatly promoted the revolutionary drive of the people that we achieved unprecedented achievements on the industrial front and even on the entire economic front. In the future, we should continue to criticize this erroneous tendency of only seeing things and not people, and continue to wage resolute struggles against those who attempt to use certain shortcomings in our work to doubt and oppose the general line of socialist construction and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the "tidal current faction" and the "accounting faction." However, it should be pointed out that our emphasis on the subjective initiative of people does not mean denying the role of material and technical conditions. Only seeing things and not people is of course wrong; similarly, only seeing people and not things is also wrong. Everyone knows that economic development is restricted by certain material and technical conditions. For example, ironmaking and steelmaking require various material and technical conditions such as ore, coal, electricity, blast furnace equipment, and open hearth furnace equipment. Without these conditions, production cannot be carried out. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Those who direct war cannot demand victory in war beyond the limits permitted by objective conditions, but they can and must actively strive for victory in war within the limits of objective conditions." When we guide economic work, just like guiding war, we must fully mobilize people's subjective initiative to strive for victory, but we must never deny or ignore the important role of material and technical conditions, and we must never plan our actions beyond the possibilities of objective conditions. We must, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's opinion, properly treat the relationship between objective conditions and subjective initiative in economic work, and correctly combine the two, so that we can have full guarantee to achieve victory.

To make industry develop at a high speed, the whole Party must be mobilized to combine centralized leadership with a large-scale mass movement. In 1958, due to the development of the mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to run industry and make steel, there were both large-scale enterprises, mass movements using foreign methods of production ("large foreign groups"), and small-scale enterprises, mass movements using indigenous methods of production ("small indigenous groups"), which broke the cold and desolate situation of relying only on a few people to run industry, and created a new situation of the whole people running industry in a vigorous manner. This movement of the whole people running industry not only greatly leaped forward in China's industrial production, but also extensively gave workers, peasants, and urban residents an industrial education, technical training, and labor exercise, playing the role of making steel and cultivating people, and also further combined industry and agriculture, cities and villages.

Some people once held a skeptical attitude towards carrying out large-scale mass movements on the industrial front. They believed that it was possible to adopt the mass line method to run agriculture, but not to run industry; it was possible to run small-scale industry, but not to run large-scale industry. They always wanted to use simple administrative orders and rigid rules and regulations to handle things, and resisted the working methods of the mass line. They do not understand that the socialist industrialization cause is the cause of the broadest masses of people. Without relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broadest masses of people, the socialist industrialization cause cannot develop at a high speed. Of course, the mass movement must be closely combined with centralized leadership. The more the mass movement develops, the more it needs the strong leadership of the Party. Party organizations and economic workers at all levels should regularly explain the current tasks and methods of completing the tasks, as well as the possible difficulties, to the masses, and mobilize the masses to launch a debate, listen to the opinions of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and give play to the strength of the masses. The "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system should be implemented, and every cadre should appear as an ordinary worker, integrate with the masses, care for the masses, and understand the masses. We should comprehensively grasp ideology, production, and life. The greater the drive of the masses, the more we should care about the lives of the masses. At the same time, we should guide the masses to not only care about current interests, but also care about long-term interests, not only care about local interests, but also care about overall interests, so that current and local interests are subordinate to long-term and overall interests. We want to enable the masses in every commune, every enterprise unit, and every public institution in every place to consciously struggle for the unified national plan, and to struggle for the realization of the Party's general line and various policies and guidelines for socialist construction.

To rapidly develop the national economy, it is also necessary to implement the policy of highlighting key points and making overall arrangements. In 1958, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong determined that the development of industry must implement the policy of steel as the key link and overall leap forward in the current period. The result of implementing this policy was that steel production rapidly increased. Although in a short period of time, some things were squeezed down and some departments were not adapted to each other; however, because the steel industry on the one hand put forward new requirements to the relevant departments, and on the other hand created new conditions for the development of the relevant departments, so, on the whole, it drove the rapid development of various industrial departments such as machinery, coal, electricity, and transportation. This fact fully shows that arranging the entire industrial construction with steel as the key link, instead of mechanically juxtaposing the various industrial departments, gives our industrial development a center that drives the overall situation. Only by grasping the key link can the mesh be opened; only by grasping the key points can the overall situation be driven; only by taking steel as the key link can there be an overall leap forward.

The development of the socialist economy must abide by the law of planned and proportionate development. This should be the case not only within the steel industry, but also between the steel industry and other industries, and between all departments of the entire national economy, that is, between industry and agriculture, between heavy industry and light industry, between industry and agriculture and transportation, between production and basic construction, between production and circulation, and between production and consumption. That is to say, there should be comprehensive arrangements, and they should all develop proportionally. Only in this way can we make the most full, most reasonable, and most effective use of human, material, and financial resources, and strive for the high-speed development of industry.

Here, it should be said a word about the issue of balance in the development of industry and even the entire national economy. In 1958, we criticized the erroneous view of negative equilibrium, which made the advanced accommodate the backward, which was completely necessary, and without this, we could not oppose right-leaning conservative ideas. In the future, we must continue to oppose negative equilibrium. However, opposing negative equilibrium does not mean that we do not want equilibrium. Comrade Mao Zedong once told us in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our country makes an economic plan once a year, arranging the appropriate proportion of accumulation and consumption, and seeking a balance between production and needs. The so-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After a year, generally speaking, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, this unity changes, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes disunity, and it is necessary to make the balance and unity of the second year. This is the superiority of our planned economy. In fact, every month and every quarter, this balance and unity are broken locally, and local adjustments need to be made." People know that the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, while criticizing negative equilibrium, put forward the proposal of positive equilibrium to make the backward catch up with the advanced, and pointed out that in order to adapt to the objective law of planned and proportionate development of the socialist economy, it is necessary to maintain the balance within a certain period of time and within a certain scope between the various departments of the national economy, and pointed out that this is precisely the task of the planning work of socialist countries.

The task of developing industry in 1959 that is placed before us is very arduous. As long as the whole Party and the people of the whole country are united and fight heroically along the victorious road of 1958, we will certainly be able to complete and overfulfill this task. In our work, we must adhere to the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit, and we must continue to maintain soaring revolutionary drive, and at the same time, we must conduct scientific analysis of everything. We have achieved great achievements in the past, but we must not be overwhelmed by these achievements, ignore the shortcomings in our work, and fail to strive to correct these shortcomings. Every comrade who does economic work must maintain a calm mind, make the work more and more detailed, and do it better and better, so that he is both red and expert, good at distinguishing the true and false phenomena of things, distinguishing the well-founded demands from the unfounded demands, and striving to make the judgment of the situation and the deployment of the work in line with reality. In this way, we will certainly be able to achieve a greater overall leap forward than in 1958 in 1959, which is of decisive significance for the three years of hard struggle.

    一九五九年工业战线的任务
    薄一波
    我国社会主义建设在一九五八年取得了伟大的胜利。在这一年里，社会主义工业化事业的发展速度，远远超过了以往任何一年。
    根据现在的预计，一九五八年比一九五七年，工业生产增长65％左右。主要工业产品中，钢增长一倍以上，达到一千一百万吨左右。在钢铁工业的带动下，机床增长两倍以上，达到九万台左右；煤炭增长一倍以上，达到两亿七千万吨左右；电力增长42％以上，达到二百七十五亿度左右。随着重工业的迅速发展，轻工业也有很大的增长，其中棉纱增长43％，达到六百八十万件左右。一九五八年我国国民经济的跃进，苏联和其他社会主义国家的跃进，同西方世界的经济危机形成了鲜明的对照。这种对照，使全国人民对于高速度发展我国社会主义建设事业、尽快地改变国家面貌、在主要工业产品的产量方面迅速超过英国等各项任务的实现，充满了信心。
    一九五八年我国在工业战线上取得伟大的胜利，有多方面的原因，归根到底是由于在整风运动的基础上认真地反对了保守思想，破除了迷信，认真地执行了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。一年来的实践，进一步地证明了党的“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。“两条腿走路”的方针，就是：在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工业和农业同时并举，重工业和轻工业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，洋法生产和土法生产同时并举，在工业战线上集中领导和群众运动相结合，在目前时期以钢为纲和全面跃进相结合。这一整套方针，正确地反映了我国的实际情况和客观经济规律的要求，因而它们在实践中显示出强大的生命力。进一步贯彻执行这一套方针，我们不但有可能在一九五九年继续跃进，并且有可能跃进得更好。
    我国工业的发展，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，一九五九年将实现一个更加宏伟的目标，按照党的八届六中全会提出的一九五九年计划指标，我国工业的生产将继续保持同一九五八年大体相同的速度向前发展，而大多数工业产品增加的绝对数量，也将比一九五八年大或者差不多。例如，一九五八年比一九五七年，钢增加了五百多万吨，煤增加了一亿四千多万吨；而一九五九年比一九五八年，钢将增加七百万吨左右，煤将增加一亿一千多万吨。其他许多重工业和轻工业产品的产量，增加的绝对数量也将是很大的。实现一九五九年的计划，我国就将在钢、铁、铜、铝、机床、发电设备等产品产量方面，分别接近、赶上或者超过英国。至于煤炭和棉织品，正如大家所知道的，在一九五八年就已经超过英国了。
    由此可见，一九五九年的工业发展计划，仍然是一个大跃进的计划，是一个多快好省的计划，是苦战三年期间一个带有决定意义的计划。人们在一九五八年已经看到，使钢产量从五百多万吨增加到一千一百万吨，我国只用了一年的时间；而主要的资本主义国家发展工业的历史表明，英国经过了三十二年，美国经过了七年，日本经过了二十年。人们在一九五九年还将看到，我国的钢产量从一千一百万吨增加到一千八百万吨；而同样的增长过程，在美国经过了五、六年，在英国经过了十八年。在旧中国，钢的最高年产量只有九十多万吨，解放以后的十年中间，我国将使钢产量增长到二十倍；而一九五九年一年增加的七百万吨左右，就大体等于旧中国最高年产量的八倍。由此又可见，不论是同主要资本主义国家的历史来比较，或是同我国的历史来比较，一九五九年钢铁的增长速度都是很快的。当然，对于我们这样一个有着六亿人口的大国来说，年产钢一千八百万吨，还远远不能满足需要；但是，从一九五八年钢产量增长的速度和一九五九年钢产量将要达到的增长速度可以看到，我国工业的高度现代化，既不需要像资本主义国家那样经过漫长的道路，也不需要像我们前几年曾经设想过的那样多的时间，这不是愈来愈清楚了吗？
    那么，这个跃进计划是不是有可能实现呢？我们认为不仅可以实现，而且还可能超额完成。
  因为这个计划指标是充分地估计了客观可能性以后提出来的。以钢产量为例，按生产能力计算，一九五九年我国十八个钢铁重点企业的炼钢能力可以达到一千六百万吨左右，正在建设的二十四个中型钢厂的炼钢能力和现在主要机械厂的炼钢能力可以达到六百万吨左右，其他小炼钢炉的能力还未计算在内。炼钢所需要的生铁，也完全有把握供应；炼钢、炼铁所需要的焦炭、洗煤、铁合金、耐火材料，在增加必需的设备以后，也都可以解决；轧钢设备能力，也可以保证钢能成材。其他重工业部门，特别是电力、运输等部门，也将能够按比例地向前发展。同时，由于一九五八年农业的大丰收，我们能够相应地发展轻工业（主要是纺织工业和造纸工业等）的生产和基本建设，以适应人民生活日益增长的需要。
    当然，要实现一九五九年的工业大跃进计划，决不是轻而易举的事情，也可能遇到各种困难。我们一定要在战略上藐视困难，又一定要在战术上重视困难。我们必须从一九五八年的丰富实践中吸取经验，提高认识，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，经过巨大的努力，进行英勇的劳动，才能完满地实现一九五九年的计划。
    一九五八年的实践证明：破除迷信，解放思想，对于促进我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，起了极大的作用。大家都已经看到，当广大干部和工人群众响应党中央和毛泽东同志关于解放思想的号召，树立起敢想敢说敢做的马克思列宁主义风格，打破了阻碍工业发展的各种迷信和清规戒律以后，在工业战线上就出现了许许多多的奇迹，不但工业发展的速度一天高过一天，而且工业在城市和乡村到处开花。为了从精神方面准备条件，来迎接新的更大的胜利，我们应当继续破除迷信，解放思想。思想解放的过程，就是认识客观世界的过程。客观世界是不断地发展和变化着的，为了使我们的思想不至于僵化，不至于落在客观形势的后面，我们就必须在实践中不断地破除迷信、解放思想，抛弃陈旧的观念，接受新生的事物，使自己的认识，随着客观世界的发展和变化而一步一步地提高。解放思想和实事求是，应当而且必须在实践中统一起来。解放思想并不是要我们不去研究客观世界，违反客观经济规律；而是要使我们的思想能够正确地或者比较正确地反映客观世界，使我们的认识能够更好地符合经济规律的客观要求。马克思主义者是追求真理的人，是胆大心细的人。我们敢于破除一切迷信，同时，我们必须尊重科学，勤恳地钻研一切科学，采取科学的态度来对待和解决经济建设中的一切问题。
    要实现一定的经济任务，不仅要充分发挥人民群众的革命干劲，而且要具备必要的物质技术条件。只见物，不见人，把物质技术条件的作用绝对化，认为人只能受它的支配，看不到或者不承认人是生产中最活跃的因素，忽视人的主观能动性，因而不去充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，这是一种右倾保守主义的错误。在一九五八年，正是由于我们批判和克服了这种错误倾向，大大发扬了人民群众的革命干劲，因而在工业战线上以至整个经济战线上取得了前所未有的成就。我们在今后应当继续批判这种只见物不见人的错误倾向，并且同那些企图利用我们工作中的某些缺点，来怀疑和反对社会主义建设总路线、工农业生产大跃进的观潮派、算账派，继续进行坚决的斗争。但是，应当指出，我们重视人的主观能动作用，并不是要否认物质技术条件的作用。只见物，不见人，当然是错误的；同样，只见人，不见物，也是错误的。谁都知道，经济的发展是受一定的物质技术条件所制约的。比如，炼铁炼钢，就需要矿石、煤炭、电力和高炉设备、平炉设备等各种物质技术条件，缺乏这些条件，就不能进行生产。毛泽东同志说过：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。”我们指导经济工作，正如指导战争一样，必须充分发挥人的主
  观能动作用，来争取胜利，但是决不应当因此否认或者忽视物质技术条件的重要作用，决不能够超越客观条件的可能来计划自己的行动。我们必须按照毛泽东同志的意见，在经济工作中适当地对待客观条件和主观能动作用的关系，把两者正确地结合起来，以便我们能够有充分的保证来取得胜利。
    要使工业高速度地发展，必须全党动手，把集中领导和大搞群众运动结合起来。我们在一九五八年，由于开展了全党全民大办工业和大炼钢铁的群众运动，既有大型企业、洋法生产的群众运动（“大洋群”），又有小型企业、土法生产的群众运动（“小土群”），这就打破了只靠少数人办工业的冷冷清清的局面，出现了全民办工业的轰轰烈烈的新局面。这一个全民办工业的运动，不仅使我国的工业生产量得到了很大的跃进，而且极为广泛地使工人、农民和城市居民受到了一次工业教育、技术训练和劳动锻炼，起了炼钢又炼人的作用，同时也使工业和农业、城市和乡村有了进一步的结合。
    对于在工业战线上大搞群众运动，曾经有一些人抱着怀疑态度，他们认为采取群众路线的方法办农业可以，办工业就不可以；办小型工业可以，办大型工业就不可以。他们总是想用单纯的行政命令、死板的规章制度来办事情，而对群众路线的工作方法加以抵制。他们不懂得，社会主义工业化事业是最广大群众的切身事业，如果不依靠最广大群众的积极性和创造性，社会主义工业化事业是不可能高速度发展的。当然，群众运动必须同集中领导密切结合起来。群众运动越开展，就越需要党的坚强的领导。各级党组织和经济工作人员，应当经常把当前的任务和完成任务的方法，以及可能出现的困难，向群众交代清楚，并且发动群众展开鸣放辩论，倾听群众的意见，集中群众的智慧，发挥群众的力量。应当贯彻执行
  “两参、一改、三结合”的制度，每个干部都要以普通劳动者的身份出现，同群众打成一片，关心群众，了解群众。应当全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，群众的干劲越大，就越要关心群众的生活。同时，应当引导群众不仅关心当前的利益，而且关心长远的利益，不仅关心局部的利益，而且关心全局的利益，使当前的、局部的利益服从于长远的、全局的利益。我们要使各地方的每个公社、每个企业单位和每个事业单位的群众都能够自觉地为统一的国家计划而奋斗，为实现党的社会主义建设总路线和各项方针、政策而奋斗。
    要迅速发展国民经济，还必须执行重点突出、全面安排的方针。一九五八年党中央和毛泽东同志确定了发展工业在目前时期必须实行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。执行这个方针的结果，使得钢的产量迅速地增长上去。虽然在一个短时期内，曾经把某些东西挤了下来，某些部门出现了互不适应的情况；但是由于钢铁工业一方面向有关部门提出了新的要求，另一方面又给有关部门的发展创造了新的条件，所以，总的说来是带动了机械、煤炭、电力等各个工业部门以及交通运输业的迅速发展。这个事实充分说明，以钢为纲来安排整个工业建设，而不是把各个工业部门机械地平列起来，这就使我们的工业发展有了带动全局的中心。只有纲举，才能目张；只有抓住重点，才能带动全盘；只有以钢为纲，才能全面跃进。
    社会主义经济的发展，必须遵守有计划按比例发展的法则。不仅钢铁工业内部应当如此，而且钢铁工业和其他工业之间，以及整个国民经济各部门之间，即工业和农业之间，重工业和轻工业之间，工农业和交通运输业之间，生产和基本建设之间，生产和流通之间，生产和消费之间，也应当如此。这也就是说，都要有全面的安排，都要使它们按比例地向前发展。只有这样，才能最充分地、最合理地、最有效地利用人力、物力和财力，才能争取工业的高速度发展。
    这里应当说一说，在工业的发展以至整个国民经济的发展中的平衡的问题。我们在一九五八年，曾经对于使先进迁就落后的消极平衡论的错误观点进行了批判，那是完全必要的，不如此就不能反对掉右倾保守思想。在今后，我们还必须继续反对消极平衡论。但是，反对消极平衡论，并不是说不要平衡。毛泽东同志曾经在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中告诉我们：“我国每年作一次经济计划，安排积累和消费的适当比例，求得生产和需要之间的平衡。所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一。这就是我们计划经济的优越性。事实上，每月每季都在局部地打破这种平衡和统一，需要作出局部的调整。”人们知道，党的八大二次会议，在批判消极平衡论的同时，就提出了使落后赶上先进的积极平衡的主张，就指出了，为着适应社会主义经济有计划按比例发展的客观规律，在国民经济各部门之间，需要保持一定时间、一定范围的平衡，并且指出，这正是社会主义国家的计划工作的任务。
    放在我们面前的一九五九年发展工业的任务是很艰巨的，只要全党、全国人民团结一致，沿着一九五八年的胜利道路英勇奋斗，我们就一定能够完成和超额完成这个任务。我们在工作中，一定要坚持革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，我们一定要继续保持冲天的革命干劲，同时又要对任何事物进行科学分析。我们过去已经取得了很大的成就，但是决不能因此而冲昏头脑，漠视工作中的缺点，不去努力改正这些缺点。我们每一个做经济工作的同志，都必须保持冷静的头脑，把工作越做越细，越做越好，使自己又红又专，善于区别事物的真象和假象，区别有根据的要求和没有根据的要求，力求对情况的判断和工作的布置切合实际。这样，我们就一定能够在一九五九年这个对苦战三年有决定意义的一年中，实现比一九五八年更大的全面跃进。
