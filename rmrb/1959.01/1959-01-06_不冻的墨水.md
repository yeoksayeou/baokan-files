    Non-Freezing Ink

    If you work outdoors in the north, you'd probably like to use non-freezing ink, right? This kind of ink has been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Ink Factory. The Aeronautical Magnetic Survey Team 903 of the Ministry of Geology used this ink in a relatively cold area of Inner Mongolia, and it didn't freeze at all.

    The cohesion of this ink is also less than that of ordinary ink, so it flows very smoothly when used, and the lines won't be intermittent.

    不冻的墨水
    你如果在北方的野外工作，大概很希望用不冻的墨水吧？这种墨水已经在天津市公私合营墨水厂试制成功。这种墨水，经过地质部航空磁测九○三队在内蒙古比较冷的地区试用，一点也没有结冻。
    这种墨水的内聚力也比普通墨水小，使用的时候出水很流利，线条不会断断续续。
