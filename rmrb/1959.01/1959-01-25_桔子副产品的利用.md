    Utilization of Tangerine By-Products
    Tangerine peels and seeds are actually very useful; they can be used for medicinal purposes and as raw materials for food. In traditional Chinese medicine, the main functions of tangerine peel are to invigorate the stomach, resolve phlegm, relieve vomiting, and stop hiccups. When combined with many other drugs with different properties, it can also play a synergistic role; when combined with atractylodes macrocephala, it tonifies the spleen; when combined with licorice, it tonifies the lungs… In short, it has a wide range of uses in traditional Chinese medicine and is in great demand. In addition, edible essential oils and pectin can be extracted from tangerine peel. Dried tangerine pith is a relatively valuable Chinese medicine, rich in vitamin P and vitamin C, which can strengthen human capillaries, prevent hypertension, and treat scurvy. In addition to its medicinal uses, tangerine seeds can also be used to extract oil, which can be refined for edible purposes.
    Now is the season when tangerines are on the market in large quantities, and relevant departments should try every means to purchase tangerine peels, seeds, etc.

    桔子副产品的利用
    桔皮、桔核其实这都大有用处，作药用，也可以用作食品原料。桔皮在中药中的主要功用是健胃、化痰、镇呕、止呃，和其他许多不同药性的药品相配，还能起到配合作用，配白?则补脾，配甘草则补肺……总之，它在中药上的用途很广，需要量也很大。另外，从桔皮中还可以提取供食用的香精油和果胶。干桔络则是一种较贵重的中药，其中含有丰富的维生素P和维生素C，它可以健全人的微血管、防止高血压和治疗坏血病。桔核除作药用外，还可以提取油脂，精炼的可作食用。
    现在正是柑桔大量上市的季节，有关部门应想尽各种办法，把桔皮、桔核等收购起来。
