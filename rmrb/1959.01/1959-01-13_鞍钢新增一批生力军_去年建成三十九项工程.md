Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 12th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company, while completing its 1958 steel production plan, also achieved significant accomplishments in capital construction. The workload of various construction projects exceeded the annual plan by 13%.

Apart from the Gongchangling magnetic separation plant and No. 4 coke oven, all other 39 projects that were required to be completed within 1958 were completed on schedule or ahead of schedule and put into production.

Anshan Iron and Steel's key projects in 1958 included No. 10 blast furnace, five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, the Donganshan ore preparation plant, and two rolling mills. These projects were completed one and a half months to half a year ahead of the schedule stipulated in the Great Leap Forward plan. It took only four months from pouring concrete to tapping iron for No. 10 blast furnace, a construction speed never seen before, shortening the construction period by half compared to the previous reconstruction of large blast furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel; and shortening the construction period by nearly two-thirds compared to China's first completely new blast furnace – Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 blast furnace. The two largest open-hearth furnaces, originally planned to be put into production in the first half of 1959, were completed in just three months from pouring concrete and put into production ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter of 1958. The Donganshan ore preparation plant, originally planned to be put into production in the first half of 1959, has also started production ahead of schedule. According to the production situation, the quality of the large-scale projects completed in 1958 is good.

The early completion and commissioning of these key projects and small blast furnace groups have greatly improved Anshan Iron and Steel's production capacity of steel, iron, and sintered ore, which not only played an important role in Anshan Iron and Steel's completion of the 1958 steel production task, but also laid the foundation for a comprehensive leap forward in Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production this year.

    鞍钢新增一批生力军
    去年建成三十九项工程
    据新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司在完成1958年钢铁生产计划的同时，基本建设也获得了巨大的成就。各项工程建设的工作量超额13％完成全年计划。
    鞍钢的基本建设工程，除弓长岭磁选厂和四号焦炉外，其他要求在1958年内完工的三十九项工程，都按期或提前竣工，并投入生产了。
    鞍钢1958年的重点工程有十号高炉、五座大型固定式平炉、东鞍山矿石准备厂及两座轧钢厂，这些工程都分别比跃进计划规定的工期提前一个半月到半年建成。十号高炉从浇灌混凝土到出铁只用了四个多月，这是过去从未有过的建设速度，比鞍钢过去改建的大型高炉的工期缩短一半；比我国第一座全部新建的高炉——武钢一号高炉的工期缩短近三分之二。原计划在1959年上半年投入生产的两座最大的平炉，从浇灌混凝土算起只用了三个月时间就建成，已提前在1958年第四季度投入生产。原计划在1959年上半年投入生产的东鞍山矿石准备厂，也已提前开工生产。根据生产的情况来看，1958年建成的大型工程质量良好。
    这些重点工程和小高炉群的提前建成投入生产，使鞍钢的钢、铁和烧结矿的生产能力有很大提高，不但对鞍钢完成1958年的钢铁生产任务起了重要作用，而且为鞍钢今年钢铁生产的全面跃进奠定了基础。
