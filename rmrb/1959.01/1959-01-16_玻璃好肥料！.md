Glass is a Good Fertilizer!
	Jialu Ruirong

	Our country's great bumper harvest of grain in 1958 was a miracle in agricultural production. It is generally recognized that the "Eight-Character Charter" of "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, tools, and management" played a role in this miracle. Here, we will only discuss fertilizer, because it is the "food of food" and has always been valued. However, in the past, people mainly focused on fertilizers such as human and animal manure, green manure, compost, pond mud, and chemical fertilizers like ammonium sulfate. No one ever thought that glass could be used as fertilizer. When glass broke, it was often thrown away. Who would have thought that this thing, once considered useless, would be utilized by our local experts as fertilizer in the great leap forward in agricultural production!

	Glass fertilizer is a new type of locally-made chemical fertilizer. Its role is to supplement plants with some nutrients. In addition to starch, protein, and fat, the human body also needs to eat vegetables, fruits, and the like, otherwise it will lack vitamins and develop various diseases. It's the same for plants. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are their main nutrients. Without nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, plants would have difficulty growing and developing. If there are only these three main elements and no boron, manganese, silicon, etc., the plant will also get sick. Take manganese as an example; without it, the leaves will have yellow spots and the veins will turn yellow. If "boron" is lacking, the development of all organs of the plant will be hindered, the ability to transport nutrients in the plant will be weakened, most flowers will fall off due to infertility, and the assimilation process will be affected. For example, weak and easily lodging rice stalks are caused by a lack of silicon. We often see that the leaves of some plants in the field turn yellow, some leaves are white, some of the ears that emerge are white, and some tillers do not produce ears. In addition to other factors, all these phenomena are caused by a lack of these elements. Glass fertilizer is an effective medicine for treating these problems.

	Boron, manganese, silicon, and other elements are called trace elements because plants need them in small quantities. If we directly apply trace elements to the soil, they often do not dissolve, making it impossible for plants to absorb and utilize them. If we directly spray them outside the roots, allowing the trace elements to enter the plant from the leaves, it is often very slow because the leaf surface structure of some crops is special. Sometimes the trace elements sprayed on the leaf surface are also washed away by rain. However, after glass fertilizer is applied to the ground, trace elements will slowly dissolve into the soil, and they are not easy to react chemically with other substances, nor will they be washed away by rain or irrigation water, so that plants can fully absorb them.

	Glass fertilizer is made from 70% broken glass (containing silicon dioxide), 15% borax, 5% iron oxide (ferrous sulfate can be used instead), 4% zinc oxide, 0.8% manganese dioxide (manganese powder can be used instead), 0.2% ammonium molybdate, and 5% copper oxide (copper sulfate can be used instead). Applying about two catties per mu can maintain the plant without lacking trace elements for two or three years. The method of making glass fertilizer is as follows: first wash the broken glass, crush it into powder, and then mix various raw materials evenly. Put the mixed materials into a graphite crucible for smelting. Build a smelting furnace with firebricks, install a blower (a wooden bellows can be used instead), put the crucible containing the material on the firebricks, and then ignite it for smelting. When all the raw materials in the crucible are melted (the temperature reaches 1200 to 1400 degrees Celsius), use a special iron rod to stir. When it is as bright as molten iron, take it out and cool it in cold water. After drying and grinding it into fine powder, it becomes glass fertilizer.

    玻璃好肥料！
    家禄  瑞荣
    我国1958年的粮食大丰收，是农业生产上的奇迹。在这个奇迹中，“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八字宪法所起的作用是大家公认的。这里且只谈肥料，因为它是“粮食的粮食”，一向受人重视。但是，过去人们所注意的肥料多限于人畜粪尿、绿肥、堆肥、塘泥和硫酸铵等化肥，从来没有想到玻璃也可以作肥料。玻璃碎了，往往被人一扔了事。谁想到这种一向被人们视为无用之物，在农业生产大跃进中，却被我们的土专家们利用来做为肥料呢！
    玻璃肥料是一种新型的土制化肥。它的作用就是给植物补充一些营养。人的身体除了需要淀粉、蛋白质、脂肪以外，还要吃一些蔬菜、水果之类的食品，否则就会缺少维生素，产生各种不同的病症。植物也是这样，氮、磷、钾是它的主要养料，缺少氮、磷、钾，植物就难以生长和发育。若是只有这三个主要元素，完全没有硼、锰、矽等元素，植物也会生病的。拿锰来说，缺了它，叶子就会出现黄斑、叶脉变黄。如果缺了“硼”，植物的一切器官发育就会受到阻碍，植物体内养分输送能力减弱，多数花因不孕而脱落，又影响同化作用的进行。又比如稻梗软弱易倒，缺矽是原因之一。我们在田间经常看见有些植物的叶子变黄，有的叶子呈白色，有的抽出来的穗是白的，有的分蘖不抽穗等等现象，除了其他因素影响外，都是缺少这些元素的缘故。玻璃肥料就是医治这些毛病的特效良药。
    硼、锰、矽等元素，因为植物需要量较少，所以称为微量元素。假如我们直接把微量元素施到土壤里，它们往往不溶解，使植物不能吸收利用。若直接根外喷射，让微量元素从叶子进到植物体内，也常常因为有些作物叶面构造特殊，微量元素进去得很慢。有时喷在叶面上的微量元素还被雨淋洗掉了。但是玻璃肥料施在地里后，微量元素会慢慢溶到土壤里，并且不容易和别的物质起化学作用，又不会被雨水或灌溉水淋洗，使植物能充分吸收。
    玻璃肥料就是利用70％碎玻璃
  （内含有二氧化矽），15％硼砂，5％氧化铁（可用黑矾代替），4％氧化锌，0.8％二氧化锰（锰粉可代替），0.2％钼酸铵，5％氧化铜（可用硫酸铜代替）等原料配制成的。每亩施二斤左右，植物可维持两、三年不缺微量元素。制炼玻璃肥料的方法是：先将碎玻璃洗净打碎磨成粉，然后再把各种原料混合掺匀，装入石墨坩锅内备炼。利用耐火砖砌成的炼炉，安上鼓风机（可用木风箱代替），把已装好料的坩锅放在耐火砖上，然后点火炼制。等坩锅里的原料全部溶化（温度达摄氏一千二百度至一千四百度），即用特制的铁棍进行搅拌。一直炼到像铁水一样明亮时，取出放在冷水中冷却，晾干后磨成细粉，就成为玻璃肥料了。
