    Two Kinds of Bees That Changed Their "Profession"
    Ci Ming
    Bees Drinking Oil
    In the summer of 1927, a professor in Venezuela discovered a strange thing: a type of stingless bee, called "Hes" by the locals, had abandoned the honey-collecting profession. Most of them went out to steal oil, leaving only one-third to collect honey and defend the hive. They flew to the oil fields, swarming around oil tanks or places where oil had spilled on the ground, sucking it with relish, and often fighting over territory. No amount of shooing would drive them away, and no amount of hitting would scatter them. Even if someone put some fragrant flowers next to them, it couldn't attract their attention—stealing oil was more important!
    It turned out that oil contains a lot of wax needed for building beehives, so the "Hes" were so keen on this job, not because they were greedy.
    Wasps Snatching Meat
    Wasps are some fiercely cruel fellows: as long as they see other insects, no matter their size or whether they are ferocious or docile, they cannot escape the attack of their venomous stingers. Even spiders, who specialize in catching flying insects, and honeybees, who have long spears for self-defense, become their prey.
    In recent years, some wasps' raiding behavior has gradually expanded to butcher shops. In the summer, especially when they are raising young wasps, they love to fly down to pork, beef, and fish to snatch scraps of meat, causing the shop assistants to rush around in a flurry, quickly swatting at them. Sometimes, wasps, angered by being swatted, would return to the nest to call in reinforcements, with dozens of them swarming towards the butcher shop, stinging and snatching.
    Why do wasps snatch meat? It is probably because they discovered that meat is tastier and easier to obtain than insects, so they changed their profession and became thieves. The snatched meat is mainly used to feed the young wasps, so they especially love to visit butcher shops when they are raising their offspring.

    两种改了“行”的蜂
    剌铭
    蜜蜂喝石油
    1927年夏天，在委内瑞拉的一位教授发现了一桩怪事：一种没有尾刺、被当地居民称为“赫斯”的蜜蜂竟放弃了采蜜的行业——大部分都出去偷石油，只留下三分之一来采蜜和保卫蜂巢。它们飞到油场，一群群地扑到油罐或淌有油的地上，津津有味地吮吸，还常常为争夺地盘而打架。赶也不走，打也不散，有人在旁边放上一些香喷喷的花，还是不能吸引它们的注意力——偷油要紧呢！
    原来石油中含有不少造蜂巢所需要的腊质，所以“赫斯”才这样热中于这件工作，并不是贪吃。
    抢肉的胡蜂
    胡蜂是一些凶残成性的家伙：只要其他昆虫被它看到，不论大小或凶驯与否，都不能幸免毒刺的攻击。甚至于那以捕捉飞虫为专业的蜘蛛和有长枪自卫的蜜蜂，也成为它的狩猎物。
    近年来，有一些胡蜂的劫掠行为渐渐扩展到肉店里来。夏天，尤其它们生养幼蜂的时候，最爱飞落到猪肉、牛肉和鱼上来，抢劫碎肉沫儿，弄得店员手忙脚乱，赶紧扑打。有时被扑打所激怒的胡蜂，会回巢班师，一群几十只地扑向肉店，又叮又抢。
    胡蜂为什么抢肉呢？这大概是它们发现肉比昆虫更好吃而易得，因而便改行做了偷儿。抢去的肉主要是为了喂养幼蜂，所以在它们养育子女的时候特别爱光顾肉店。
