    Rather give up life than give up freedom!
    -- José Martí Quote
    Every day I risk my life for my country and my duty, striving to prevent Cuba, having just won independence from Spain, from being invaded by the United States across the West Indies, invading our Latin American countries.
    The Cuban people would rather give up life than give up freedom.
    Those who fight for the cause of people's liberation or endure poverty to defend a great truth are heroes. Those who satisfy their ambitions, enslave other nations, seize more power, and plunder the lands of other peoples are not heroes, but criminals.
    I am a good man, and as a good man, I want to die facing the sun.
    Rights are not obtained by begging; they must be seized by force!
    When a person is writing history with a knife, he has no time or desire to write it on paper with a pen.
    Our Latin American revolution did not come from Rousseau, nor from Washington, but is a product of Latin America itself.
    Love for the motherland is an invincible hatred for all who oppress it, and an unending detestation for all who violate it.
    After reading the above quotes, the image of a revolutionary immediately comes to mind. José Martí, the 19th-century Cuban revolutionary leader, not only left us with such immortal sayings, but also fulfilled these words with his lifelong actions.
    José Martí was born in Havana, Cuba, on January 28, 1853. Today is the 106th anniversary of his birth. When José Martí was alive, his country was under the rule of Spanish colonialists. Like the experience of any colonizer, no matter how brutal they are, the people never give in. At that time, the city of Havana often experienced such events: a Cuban child was killed by a Spanish officer, and the masses rose up in protest; today a Spanish soldier was killed, and tomorrow Cuban citizens were shot dead. Martí actively participated in these sharp struggles when he was still very young.
    In 1869, Martí was arrested. In court, this patriotic teenager denounced Spanish rule and righteously called on the Cuban people to have the right to independence. Later, Martí was exiled to Spain, and from then on he frequently traveled abroad, having been to the United States. In the United States, he witnessed firsthand the aggressive ambitions of an imperialist. He once said: "I live in the house of the devil, but I don't know what's in his belly."
    Even living abroad, Martí continued to actively lead and organize Cuba's national liberation struggle. In the struggle, he relied closely on the working masses. He visited factories everywhere and gave speeches to the workers. The Cuban workers in the factories did not disappoint Martí; they donated money to him to run newspapers, buy arms, and join the revolutionary ranks.
    In February 1895, Martí organized the Cuban War of Independence. On May 19, he died heroically in the Battle of Dos Ríos.
    José Martí was a revolutionary leader of Cuba's resistance to Spanish colonial rule, as well as a politician, poet, and outstanding journalist. In 1953, on the centenary of his birth, the World Peace Council decided to include him as one of the world's cultural celebrities to be commemorated. (Feng)

    宁愿放弃生命，也不放弃自由！
    ——何塞·马蒂语录
    每天我都在冒着生命的危险，为着我的祖国和我的职责，我要努力避免古巴刚从西班牙赢得独立，就被美国跨过西印度群岛来，侵略我们拉丁美洲各国。
    古巴人宁愿放弃生命，也不愿意放弃自由。
    凡是为人民解放事业而奋斗的，或是为捍卫一个伟大真理而忍受穷苦的人们，才是英雄。凡是为满足野心，奴役其他民族，攫取更多的权力，掠夺其他人民的国土的人们都不是英雄，而是罪犯。
    我是个好人，作为好人，我要面向着太阳而死。
    权利不是恳求得来的，它是要武力夺取的！
    当一个人用刀在写历史，他就没有时间，也没有愿望来用笔把它写在纸上。
    我们的这拉丁美洲的革命不是从卢梭传来的，也不是华盛顿传来的，而是拉丁美洲本身的产品。
    对祖国的爱，就是对凡是压迫它的人们的不可战胜的仇恨，就是对凡是侵犯它的人们的无终止的深恶痛绝。
    读了上面这几段语录，一个革命志士的形象马上印入我们的脑子里。十九世纪的古巴革命领袖何塞·马蒂，不但给我们留下了这样一些不朽的名言，而且还以他毕生的行动履行了他自己所说的这些话。
    何塞·马蒂，于1853年1月28日生于古巴哈瓦那城。今天正是他的一百零六周年诞辰。何塞·马蒂活着的时候，他的祖国正在西班牙殖民者统治之下。像任何殖民者的遭遇一样，不管他们是如何残暴，人民始终是不屈服的。当时的哈瓦那城就经常发生这样一些事情：一个古巴小孩被一个西班牙军官打死了，群众愤起示威；今天一个西班牙士兵被打死，明天古巴市民又被击毙。马蒂还很年轻的时候，就积极地参加了这些尖锐的斗争。
    1869年，马蒂被捕。在法庭上，这个爱国少年痛斥西班牙的统治，正气凛然地呼吁古巴人民有独立的权利，以后马蒂被放逐到西班牙，从此他就经常流徙于国外，曾经到过美国。在美国，他亲眼看到一个帝国主义者的侵略野心。他曾说：“我居住在魔鬼的家里，但我不知道他的肚里有什么东西”。
    即使侨居国外，马蒂仍一直积极地领导和组织着古巴的民族解放斗争。在斗争中，他紧紧地依靠了劳动群众。他到处访问工厂，向工人们演讲。在工厂里的古巴工人们没有使马蒂失望，他们捐钱给他办报纸、买军火，参加了革命队伍。
    1895年2月，马蒂组织了古巴的民族独立战争。5月19日，他在多士·利俄斯一役中壮烈牺牲。
    何塞·马蒂是古巴反抗西班牙殖民统治的革命领袖，同时也是一个政治家、诗人和杰出的新闻记者，1953年当他一百岁诞辰时，世界和平理事会曾决定他为被纪念的世界文化名人之一。　　（凤）
