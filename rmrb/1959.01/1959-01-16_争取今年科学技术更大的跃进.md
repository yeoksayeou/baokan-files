Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction and propelled by the comprehensively leaping forward situation in industry and agriculture, China's science and technology have made great strides. 1958 was a year of great harvest for science and technology. A new situation of the entire Party and all people engaging in science and technology and making great efforts in the technological revolution is taking shape. The ever-growing ranks of scientists and technicians, with a leap-forward pace and with the enthusiastic assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, are fiercely attacking the fortresses of science and technology, constantly overcoming difficulties, and advancing bravely.

After the great leap forward in 1958, China has entered a new year of even greater leap forward. The magnificent leap forward targets for the national economy in 1959, formulated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, as well as the long-term needs of socialist construction, have put forward tremendous tasks for science and technology. In 1959, science and technology work must better serve economic and national defense construction, achieve more successes; vigorously solve the scientific and technological problems in the current and future great leap forward of production and construction; summarize and improve the rich experiences in practice; explore new scientific and technological paths and methods for a greater leap forward in production; and lay the foundation for completing the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan five years ahead of schedule.

The tasks of science and technology work in 1959 are arduous. To accomplish these tasks, we must continue to oppose conservatism, break down superstitions, advocate daring to think, speak, and act, go all out, and strive for the top. We must resolutely implement the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's consistent call for despising difficulties strategically and valuing difficulties tactically; soaring enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis. Without the communist style of riding the wind and waves and forging ahead, it is impossible to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and it is also impossible to climb the peak of world science and technology. At the same time, we must firmly remember that science and technology work requires a realistic and scientific attitude. It is impossible to break through scientific fortresses with only enthusiasm but without realistic, in-depth, and meticulous work. Breaking down superstitions means respecting science, establishing scientific viewpoints, and using scientific methods to do work. We have confidence that we will be able to overcome all scientific fortresses, and no difficulties can stop us. However, for each specific task, we must not ignore difficulties. It must be recognized that science and technology are not mysterious, but they are also not simple. Science and technology work is a kind of work that explores the laws of nature and then transforms nature. It is itself a process of constantly overcoming difficulties. The great revolutionary teacher Marx once told us: "There is no smooth road in science, and only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path can hope to reach the glorious summit." The more we develop our struggle with nature comprehensively and deeply, the more problems we may encounter. The more important the scientific and technological problems, the more difficulties there are. Even many research and experimental work may have temporary failures in the process of advancement, but as long as our direction is correct, we should not be afraid of difficulties. When encountering difficulties, we must rely on the masses and take measures to overcome them. If we fail temporarily, we must summarize experience, improve methods, make persistent efforts, and adhere to progress. In this way, we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory.

To achieve a greater leap forward in science and technology in 1959, we must combine the comprehensiveness and focus of science and technology work well, and there should be no bias. Scientific and technological tasks are arduous. In terms of strength arrangement, we must grasp the key points. Grasping the key points makes it easier to strengthen leadership, concentrate the necessary manpower and material resources to ensure the completion of the country's main tasks, and drive the development of related disciplines. The key points of science and technology work are the issues that are urgently needed to be solved in economic construction and national defense construction. In various regions, they are the key scientific and technological problems and rich experiences put forward in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture in the region. Each place has its own characteristics of natural resources and industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, the specific content of the key points will also be different. Vigorously developing these key points will more effectively serve the economic construction of the region. However, guaranteeing the key points does not mean denying the comprehensive development of science and technology. The various science and technology departments are interconnected and mutually restrictive. In order to ensure the development of the key points, other related science and technology should keep up. If we only see the key points without the cooperation of other aspects, the key points cannot be developed. Science and technology is also a long-term work, requiring accumulation and reserves; what is not a key point today may be a key point in a while, and if we do not arrange tasks today, it will be too late to grasp it later. We are a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population, and every science and technology is necessary. This requires eliminating blank departments and building a comprehensive and complete science and technology system. Therefore, we must attach importance to the development of several comprehensive cutting-edge science and technologies, and at the same time, we must also attach importance to the development of cutting-edge science and technologies in all walks of life. In each science and technology department, we must not only attach importance to the cutting-edge science and technology parts, but also attach great importance to the general science and technology parts. There should be appropriate arrangements for theoretical research in basic disciplines. Theory must be linked to practice. This is our unwavering policy. We must emphasize this point in the future and oppose the tendency of theory divorcing from practice. However, it cannot be assumed that all theoretical research is divorced from practice and therefore unnecessary; this view is incorrect. It is correct to "drive" the development of disciplines with current tasks, and great results have been achieved in recent years, and this will continue to be done resolutely in the future. However, this kind of comprehensive research starting from current tasks should be combined with classified research. Under the premise of comprehensive research, the role of classification should be fully utilized. If we only arrange scientific work from the current tasks, without considering long-term and systematic scientific research, and use tasks to "replace" disciplines and cancel disciplines, that is incorrect. Much scientific and technological research work is pioneering work. The choice of technical policies and the formulation of production plans are often based on the results of these pioneering works. Therefore, in addition to the urgent tasks put forward from current production that should be given priority, certain research work that seems not very urgent from the perspective of production but can open up new paths for production must be carried out as early as possible. These research works that can open up new paths for production are often closely related to the theoretical research of basic disciplines. We do not have too much theoretical research now, but too little. Theoretical research work, as long as it has a clear purpose, should be actively supported. Even if the practical role of certain theoretical research work with important significance is not yet visible for a while, certain manpower and material resources should be used to engage in the work. Ignoring theoretical research work is not conducive to the comprehensive and long-term development of science and technology.

To accomplish the science and technology tasks in 1959, we must fully utilize and properly arrange the national science and technology forces. On the one hand, we must make comprehensive arrangements for major and key science and technology work nationwide, organize the science and technology forces under the central government and the local governments, and first jointly complete major tasks of national significance. But at the same time, we must actively carry out regional science and technology work. Due to the decentralization of our management system, a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, cultural and educational, and scientific research institutions have been decentralized; the broad masses have actively devoted themselves to the technological revolution and cultural revolution; and the local science and technology forces have greatly developed. The development of local science and technology work is not only very necessary, but also has full possibilities. All localities should universally formulate science and technology plans at all levels, from provinces and cities to special districts, counties, and communes, as a component of the local national economic plan, and organize the cooperation of science and technology research institutions, so that local science and technology is closely integrated with production, and local scientists and technicians and the broad masses have a common direction of effort in science and technology.

The fundamental guarantee for realizing a greater leap forward in science and technology in 1959 is to strengthen the leadership of the Party and implement the working method of the mass line. Of all the lines, the Party's leadership is the first line, and of all the plans, the mass line is the first plan. The Party organizations in various localities, various scientific research institutions, industrial and mining enterprises, and people's communes should strengthen their leadership over science and technology work and regularly inspect science and technology work. We believe that as long as we rely on the broad masses under the leadership of the Party and continue to carry out the great technological revolution and cultural revolution, no difficulties can stop our progress. We will certainly be able to victoriously realize the greater leap forward in science and technology in 1959.

    争取今年科学技术更大的跃进
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业全面大跃进的形势推动下，我国的科学技术事业取得了飞跃的进展。1958年是科学技术大丰收的一年。全党全民大办科学、大闹技术革命的新形势，正在形成。日益壮大的科学技术队伍，以大跃进的步伐，在苏联和其它兄弟国家的热情援助下，猛攻科学技术的堡垒，不断地克服困难，奋勇前进。
    经过了1958年的大跃进之后，我国进入了更大跃进的新的一年。党的八届六中全会所制订的1959年国民经济的宏伟的跃进指标以及建设社会主义的长远需要，向科学技术工作提出了巨大的任务。1959年科学技术工作必须更好地为经济建设和国防建设服务，获得更多的成就；要大力解决当前和今后生产建设大跃进中的科学技术问题，要总结和提高实践中的丰富经验，要为生产的更大跃进探索新的科学技术途径和新的方法，要为提前五年完成十二年科学技术发展规划打下基础。
    1959年的科学技术工作的任务是艰巨的，要完成这些任务，必须继续反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游。必须坚决贯彻毛泽东同志历来提出的在战略上要藐视困难、在战术上要重视困难的精神；冲天的干劲要和科学分析相结合。没有乘风破浪、勇往直前的共产主义风格，要多快好省地建设社会主义是不可能的，要攀登世界科学技术高峰也是不可能的。与此同时，我们必须牢牢记住，科学技术工作需要有实事求是的科学态度，仅有满腔热情，而没有实事求是的深入细致的工作，要攻破科学堡垒也是不可能的。破除迷信，就是尊重科学，就是树立科学的观点，运用科学的方法来做工作。我们有信心，我们一定能够攻克一切科学堡垒，任何困难都难不倒我们。但是，对于每一项具体的工作，我们就决不能无视困难。必须认识，科学技术并不神秘，但也不简单。科学技术工作是一种探索自然规律进而变革自然的工作，它本身就是一个不断克服困难的过程。伟大的革命导师马克思曾经告诉我们：“在科学上面是没有平坦的大道可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，才有希望到达光辉的顶点。”我们和自然的斗争愈是向全面、向纵深发展，所遇到的问题可能也就愈多。越是重大的科学技术问题，往往困难越多。甚至许多研究试验工作，在前进的过程中，还有暂时失败的可能，但是只要我们的方向是对头的，就不要怕困难。遇到困难，就要依靠群众，采取措施去克服。暂时失败了，就要总结经验，改进办法，再接再厉，坚持前进。这样，我们就一定能够克服一切困难，取得胜利。
    要实现1959年科学技术的更大跃进，必须将科学技术工作的全面与重点很好结合起来，不能有所偏废。科学技术任务繁重，在力量安排上，必须抓住重点。抓对了重点，就便于加强领导，集中必需的人力物力，以保证完成国家主要的任务，并带动有关学科的发展。科学技术工作的重点是有关经济建设和国防建设所迫切需要解决的课题，在各个地区是有关本地区工农业大跃进中所提出的关键性的科学技术问题和丰富的经验，各个地方都有自己的自然资源和工农业生产的特点，因此，重点的具体内容，也将有所不同。大力发展这些重点，将能更有效地为本地区经济建设服务。但是，保证重点，并不是要否定科学技术的全面发展，各个科学技术部门是互相联系、互相制约的，为了保证重点的发展，其他有关的科学技术就应该跟上去。如果只看到重点，没有其他方面的配合，重点发展也不可能。科学技术又是一个长期性的工作，需要积累、储备；今天不是重点，过些时候可能就是重点，今天不安排任务，过些时候再抓就来不及了。我们是一个地大物博、人口众多的国家，每一门科学技术都是必需的，这就要求消灭空白部门，建成一个全面的完整的科学技术体系。因此，我们要重视几门综合性的尖端科学技术的发展，同时也要重视各行各业尖端科学技术的发展。在每个科学技术部门中，既要重视其中的尖端科学技术部分，也要十分重视其中的一般科学技术部分。对基础学科的理论研究，要有恰当的安排。理论必须联系实际，这是我们坚定不移的方针，今后还要强调这一点，还要反对理论脱离实际的倾向。但是，不能认为，凡是理论研究都是脱离实际的，因而都是不需要的；这种看法是不对的。用当前的任务来“带动”学科的发展，是正确的，几年来收到很大效果，今后还要坚决地继续这样做。但是这种从当前任务出发的综合研究应当同分科研究结合起来进行，在综合研究的前提下，应当充分发挥分科的作用。如果仅仅从当前任务来安排科学工作，而不考虑长远的系统的科学研究，用任务“代替”学科，取消学科，那是不对的。科学技术研究工作有许多是先行的工作。技术政策的抉择，生产计划的制定，往往要以这些先行工作的成果为依据。因此，除了从当前生产中提出的迫切任务应当优先进行工作以外，某些从生产的观点看来似乎并不十分迫切但能为生产开辟新途径的研究工作必需及早进行。这些能为生产开辟新途径的研究工作，往往也是与基础学科的理论研究密切有关的。我们现在不是理论研究太多，而是太少。理论研究工作，只要有明确的目的，便应该积极支持。某些有重要意义的理论研究工作，一时即使还看不到它的实际作用，也应该用一定的人力物力来从事工作。忽视理论研究工作，对科学技术的全面发展和长远发展是不利的。
    要完成1959年的科学技术任务，必须充分发挥和正确安排全国的科学技术力量。一方面必须在全国范围内，把重大的关键性的科学技术工作进行全面的安排，把中央所属的和地方的科学技术力量组织起来，首先共同完成具有全国意义的重大任务。但与此同时，必须积极开展地区性的科学技术工作。由于我国管理体制下放，大批工矿企业、文化教育和科学研究机关下放了；广大群众积极地投入了技术革命与文化革命；地方的科学技术力量有了很大发展。地方科学技术工作的开展不仅已十分必要，而且也有了充分的可能。各地应普遍制订各级的科学技术规划，从省市到专、县、社，作为当地国民经济计划的组成部分，并组织科学技术研究机构的协作，使当地的科学技术密切和生产相结合，使当地的科学技术人员和广大群众在科学技术方面有一个共同努力的方向。
    实现1959年科学技术更大跃进的根本保证是加强党的领导和贯彻群众路线的工作方法。千条万条，党的领导是第一条，千计万计，群众路线是第一计。各个地方、各个科学研究机构、工矿企业、人民公社的党的组织，应该加强对科学技术工作的领导，定期检查科学技术工作。我们相信，只要在党的领导下，依靠广大群众，继续进行伟大的技术革命和文化革命，任何困难都阻挡不了我们的前进。我们一定能够胜利地实现1959年科学技术的更大跃进。
