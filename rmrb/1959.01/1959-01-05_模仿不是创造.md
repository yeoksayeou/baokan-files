    Imitation Is Not Creation
    Qin Li
    I often listen to the news broadcasts, and I've become familiar with one broadcaster's voice. Before he even speaks three sentences, we know: It's Qi Yue!
    However, sometimes we are "deceived" by that voice. We originally thought it was Comrade Qi Yue reporting the news, but after the name was announced, we realized it was someone else. At this time, I always think: Why are their voices so similar?
    The news reported by Comrade Qi Yue is clear and accurate. More importantly, he is good at combining the news content, and his voice is full of emotion, which can strongly infect the audience. I think that if we want to learn, we should probably start here, as for whether the tone should also be similar, that is not necessarily the case.
    Recently, I went on a business trip to a small mining town. The broadcasters at the local mine radio station were broadcasting mine notices, imitating Comrade Qi Yue's tone and momentum when broadcasting important announcements. It felt very unnatural, and I felt that the broadcaster was too restrained.
    People's throats and vocal cords are somewhat different. In fact, everyone can develop and create according to their own characteristics, and absorbing the strengths of others is not for the purpose of blindly copying. Even if you achieve exactly the same as others, can you be satisfied?
    This can't help but remind people of Mr. Mei Lanfang. Mr. Mei first studied with Wu Lingxian, but he never completely followed his teacher's path. He absorbed nutrients from many sources, and also learned opera from old performers such as Wang Yaoqing and Lu Sanbao. On the one hand, he took the strengths of others, but more importantly, he combined his own appearance, voice and other conditions to create his own style, which was praised as a school. This is a kind of creation, which has greatly enriched the art of Chinese opera performance.
    In this way, being satisfied with mere imitation is a kind of stagnation, not progress!

    模仿不是创造
    秦犁
    常听新闻广播，熟悉了一位广播员的声音，还没等他讲上三句，我们就知道了：这是齐越！
    然而，有时也会被那声音“欺骗”了。我们原以为那是齐越同志在报告新闻，但待通名报姓以后，才知是别人。这时候，我总想到：他们的声音何以如此相似？
    齐越同志报告的新闻，清楚准确，更重要的是他善于结合新闻内容，声音里充满感情，可以强烈的感染听众。我想，若要学习恐怕也要从这里入手，至于音调是否也要相似，那倒不一定。
    最近出差到一个矿区小城去，那里矿区电台的广播员在广播矿上一些通知时，也一味模仿着齐越同志在广播重要文告时的音调和气势，听了叫人觉得很不自然，深感这位广播员过于拘束了。
    人的喉咙声带都有些差异，其实每个人尽可以根据自己的特点去发展创造，而吸取他人的营养，其目的并不是为了生搬硬套；即或做到了与别人一模一样，难道就可以满足了吗？
    这不由得让人想起梅兰芳先生来。梅先生初从吴菱仙学艺，但他从来并没有完全按照师父的路数走，他多方面的吸收营养，也跟老伶工王瑶卿、路三宝等人学过戏，他一方面取人之长，但更重要的是结合自己的外型、嗓音等条件，独创一格地形成自己的风格，并被人誉为一派，这是一种创造，在丰富我国戏曲表演艺术上有很大作用。
    这样说来，满足于单纯模仿正是一种停滞，不是前进！
