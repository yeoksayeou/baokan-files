Enlistment and Enrollment
    Ge De
    After breakfast, I saw off several comrades who were enlisting in the army. Six strong young men, radiant with joy, wearing new uniforms and big red flowers on their chests, were surrounded by people amidst applause and the sound of gongs and drums, and boarded the car to go to a new post.
    Naturally, there was some reluctance to part, but more than that, there was passion and laughter. What touched me even more was: they have become glorious soldiers!
    In fact, they have long been soldiers.
    All six are printing workers. I remember during the Middle East event and the Taiwan Strait crisis, I often went to see them setting type and making up pages. They used to call each piece of lead type "our shells." Newspaper typesetters are also the first to read the news and commentary, and their discussions often showed their ability to understand the situation. They were nervous, happy, and often said that the printing factory was both a battlefield and a school, and their work was both a battle and a study.
    Therefore, they are both soldiers and students.
    Now, they have moved to another battlefield; but at the same time, they have entered another, larger school. They will receive new training and new learning. Many of us have come from that battlefield and school, and the training and cultivation it gave us is unforgettable for the rest of our lives.
    I remembered my own enlistment. At that time, my home had fallen into the occupied area of the Japanese invaders, and I, who had just turned fifteen, felt the oppression firsthand. One night, I told my mother that I had decided to leave and join the Eighth Route Army. I said, "In this day and age, if you don't become a Chinese soldier, you will be caught by the Japanese devils and forced to become a puppet soldier. Anyway, I can't stay at home." After thinking about it, my mother sent me away with tears in her eyes. In fact, this was seeking survival in death, but I didn't understand more about the principles. I only knew that this was resisting Japan, and I didn't know that this was a revolution; as for resisting Japan, I just wanted to defeat the Japanese devils and go home, and if I couldn't defeat the Japanese devils, I would rather die than be a slave to a foreign country. As for class consciousness, I didn't have any. However, when I stepped onto the anti-Japanese battlefield, I had actually entered a university. This university made me understand that the Japanese devils must be defeated, and we must achieve final victory; it made me understand the infinite glorious future of the Chinese revolution. I still remember, one evening after dinner, I was chatting with the instructor under a tree in the village. He asked me, "What is the task of the Chinese revolution? What are the targets of the revolution? What is the driving force of the revolution?" I thought for a while and blushed and said, "I don't know." He smiled and gave me a copy of "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," saying, "Read it carefully." This was an important lesson I learned in this university. Many of us entered the gates of revolutionary schools in this way. In this university, experiencing various educations and exercises, our horizons gradually opened up, our steps became more and more firm, and finally, we were gradually cultivated into a soldier in the communist ranks. The six comrades I saw off, as well as the comrades who enlisted in the army from all over the country, have naturally received the Party's education for a long time and have more or less communist awareness. With such intelligent and good-quality students, training and learning in such a good school, the achievements are immeasurable.
    Enlistment is enrollment, and it is fortunate to be able to get such a learning opportunity. Moreover, what they shoulder is the glorious mission of safeguarding the peaceful construction of the motherland.

    入伍和入学
    葛德
    早饭后，欢送了几个应征入伍的同志。六个年轻力壮的小伙子，容光焕发，身着新戎装，胸佩大红花，在掌声和锣鼓声中，被人们簇拥上汽车，走上一个新的岗位了。
    依依惜别的情怀自然是有的，但更多的是激情和欢笑，在我更有所感触：他们成了光荣的战士了！
    其实，他们又早就都是战士了。
    六个人都是印刷工人，记得中东事件和台湾海峡事件的时候，我常常去看他们排字和拼版。他们曾把一个个的铅字称作是“我们的炮弹”。报纸的排字工人，又是最早读到新闻和评论的人，从他们不时的谈论中，显示着他们洞察局势的能力。他们紧张、欢乐，常常说印刷厂是战场又是学校，他们的工作是战斗也是学习。
    所以，他们既是战士又是学生。
    如今，他们转入了另一个战场；但同时却转入了另一个更大的学校。他们将得到新的锻炼和新的学习。我们许多人都是从那个战场和学校走过来的，它给予我们的锻炼和培育，是我们终生难忘的。
    我记起了我自己的入伍。那时我的家已沦为日寇的占领区，刚刚踏入十五岁的我，感到切身的压迫了。一个夜间，我告诉母亲，我决计出走参加八路军去。我说：“这年头不当中国兵，就得被鬼子抓去当伪军，反正家里是呆不住了。”母亲想了想，便含着眼泪把我送走了。这其实也就是死亡中求生存了，然而更多的道理我却不懂。我只知道这是抗日，并不知道这是革命；对于抗日，我也只是打败鬼子便回家，打不败鬼子，宁死也不当亡国奴。至于阶级觉悟是一点也没有的。然而，当我走上了抗日战场的同时，实际上也已经走进了一个大学校。这个大学校使我懂得日本鬼子一定要被打败，我们一定要取得最后胜利；使我懂得了中国革命的无限光荣前途。我还记得，一次晚饭后，我同指导员在村边树下闲谈。他问我：“中国革命的任务是什么？革命的对象是什么？革命的动力是什么？”我想了想红着脸说：“不知道”。他笑了笑给了我一本“中国革命和中国共产党”，说“好好读读吧”。这是我在这个大学校学到的重要的一课。我们许多人都是这样地走进了革命学校的大门。在这个大学校里，经历着各种教育和锻炼，我们的眼界逐渐打开了，我们的脚步越走越坚实了，终于，被逐渐培育成为共产主义队伍里的一名战士。我欢送的这六个同志，以及从全国各地应征入伍的同志，自然早就受到了党的教育，有了或多或少的共产主义觉悟。具有这样聪明和良好素质的学生，在这样好的学校里锻炼和学习，那成就正是不可估量的。
    入伍也就是入学，能够得到这样的学习机会，是值得庆幸的。又何况他们所肩负的是保卫祖国和平建设的头等光荣的使命呢？
