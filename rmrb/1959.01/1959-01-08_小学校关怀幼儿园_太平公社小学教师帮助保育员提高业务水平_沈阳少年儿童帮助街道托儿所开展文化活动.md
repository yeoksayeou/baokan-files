　　Primary Schools Care for Kindergartens
　　Teachers of Taiping Commune Primary School Help Nurturers Improve Professional Skills
　　Shenyang Children Help Street Nurseries Carry Out Cultural Activities
　　(This newspaper dispatch) According to reports, in Sichuan Province, Suining County, the Taiping People's Commune, in order to help nurturers rapidly improve their political, cultural, and professional levels, under the leadership of the Party general branch, adopted the method of strengthening primary school guidance for kindergartens, enabling the kindergartens to be consolidated day by day. At present, the commune has established thirty-four kindergartens, with one thousand one hundred and thirty children enrolled. The children's parents have responded very well.
　　Every Sunday, the commune's primary school concentrates the nurturers to study and exchange experiences in childcare work, practice singing, find teaching materials, and hold on-site meetings, and visit instructional workshops. Two instructional workshops and on-site meetings have been held this period, which has greatly helped improve the nurturers' professional skills. In order to solve the difficulty of nurturers lacking teaching materials, the commune's primary school, in addition to compiling and printing some to distribute to them, sometimes also works with the nurturers to self-compile some children's songs and games. Public and private primary school teachers also adopt the method of individually contracting guidance to help nurturers solve specific problems in their work, and mobilize primary school students to make toys for kindergartens.
　　Through the above work, the nurturers of the entire commune's kindergartens have greatly improved in terms of political thought and professional level, and have continuously improved their teaching. At present, the nurturers in each kindergarten can teach several songs and teach children to play some simple games, and the number of people who are not at ease with their work has been greatly reduced. For example, nurturers Yi Zongzhen and Deng Mingying have exerted great energy in learning and teaching, and can compile their own teaching materials and create games suitable for children's age characteristics.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. Shenyang city middle and primary school children are using their spare time to help street kindergartens and nurseries carry out cultural activities, making the lives of children in kindergartens and nurseries more lively and enriching.
　　Since September last year, street nurseries and kindergartens in Shenyang city have developed greatly. Under the organization of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Young Pioneers and children in middle and primary schools throughout the city are generally in contact with street nurseries and serve as assistants to the nurturers. In their spare time, the Young Pioneers and children go to nurseries and kindergartens to teach preschool children songs, dances, and drawing. Middle and primary school students also made more than 50,000 exquisite toys in their spare time and gave them to street nurseries.

    小学校关怀幼儿园
    太平公社小学教师帮助保育员提高业务水平
    沈阳少年儿童帮助街道托儿所开展文化活动
    本报讯　四川省遂宁县太平人民公社，为了帮助保育员迅速提高政治、文化和业务水平，在党总支领导下，采取了由小学加强对幼儿园的辅导的办法，使幼儿园一天天巩固起来。目前该社已办起幼儿园三十四所，入园幼儿一千一百三十人。儿童的家长反映很好。
    公社小学每个星期日都要把保育人员集中起来学习和交流幼儿工作的经验，练习唱歌、找教材、开现场会议，参观教学。本期已举办了两次参观教学和现场会议的活动，对保育人员业务的提高有很大帮助。为了解决保育人员缺乏教材的困难，公社小学除了编印一部分发给他们外，有时还同保育人员一起，自编一些儿歌、游戏。公立和民办小学的教师并采取分别包干辅导的办法，帮助保育人员解决工作上的具体问题，发动小学学生为幼儿园做玩具。
    通过以上工作，全社幼儿园的保育人员在政治思想和业务水平方面都有很大提高，不断地改进了教学。目前每所幼儿园的保育人员都会教唱几首歌和教儿童做一些简单游戏，不安心工作的人大大减少了。如保育人员易宗贞、邓明英在边学边教中发挥了很大干劲，能自己编选教材，自己创造适合幼儿年龄特征的游戏。
    据新华社沈阳7日电　沈阳市中、小学校的少年儿童利用课余时间到街道幼儿园和托儿所帮助开展文化活动，使幼儿园和托儿所儿童的生活更加活泼和丰富。
    沈阳市自去年9月以来，街道托儿所和幼儿园有了很大发展。在共青团沈阳市委的组织下，全市中、小学校的少先队员和少年儿童普遍和街道托儿所联系，担任保育员的助手。在课余时间，少先队员和少年儿童就到托儿所和幼儿园去，教入托的学前儿童唱歌、舞蹈和画画。中、小学生还在课余时间做了五万多件精致的玩具，送给街道托儿所。
