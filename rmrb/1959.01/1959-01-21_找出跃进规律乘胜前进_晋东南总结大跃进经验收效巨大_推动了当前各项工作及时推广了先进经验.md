　　This newspaper reports that the Jin Southeast region of Shanxi Province, with the entire party and all the people, has carried out investigation and research to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward and has achieved fruitful results. Through the mass investigation and research summary, many good experiences have been found, which is of great help in promoting current work and striving for a greater leap forward this year.
　　In order to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and explore the laws of the Great Leap Forward, the CPC Jin Southeast Prefectural Committee issued a decision on October 19 last year on carrying out investigation and research by the entire party and all the people to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. After that, a upsurge of investigation and summarizing the 1958 Great Leap Forward movement was set off throughout the region. More than 1.7 million people participated in this movement, including veteran cadres, new cadres, workers, peasants, soldiers, and students. They wrote and summarized their own experiences, and wrote various investigation reports and experience summaries. Many experiences have been compiled into books. Among them, there are summaries of agricultural production increase experience, the "Electroplating Technology" and "Automatic Technology" collectively created by workers of Huifeng Machinery Factory, which is as long as 130,000 words, "Stamping Technology" created by Li Baozhen, a young worker of Huifeng Machinery Factory, and "Miners' Uprising" collectively created by workers of Luan Coal Mine and the "Nine Years of Accident-Free Experience" of the Wuyang Pit of the mine after liberation. Under the impetus of the mass movement, many veteran Chinese medicine practitioners also summarized and wrote down their long-held experiences. Qin Zixing, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Xiangyuan Town, wrote down the secret recipe for treating lymphadenitis passed down from his ancestors, which was praised by everyone.
　　Through mass investigation and summarization, the specific experiences and specific laws in various aspects were systematically summarized, the key to the work was found, and the current work was promoted. For example, the summary of agricultural production increase experience, the "Eight-Character Charter" of water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, engineering, and management, has been specifically summarized according to the specific conditions and experience of their own regions. Eight people's communes in Huguan Town compared the experience of increasing production on 15,800 mu of wheat land last year with the lessons of past production reduction, which greatly promoted winter wheat field management. The county relied on the masses to summarize the experience of agricultural production increase, thereby finding out the general laws for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in the alpine mountainous areas, as well as the specific characteristics that each commune should pay attention to when applying these laws, and on this basis, it determined this year's leap forward plan. Because of this, the plan has been better formulated, with both bold goals and sufficient measures to guarantee it.
　　Through mass investigation and summarization, many good experiences have been promoted in a timely manner. For example, after Huguan summarized the ten major benefits and four major experiences of deep plowing, it was quickly promoted throughout the county, making 450,000 mu of basic farmland quickly and well completed deep plowing. Liang Guanglin, secretary of the Party Committee of Liushukou Commune in Jincheng, found that all the sheep raised by shepherd Zhao Sixiao were pregnant after mating, and six of them were pregnant with twins, so he promptly promoted his experience. The masses regarded writing summaries as a matter of honor. For example, Jia Zhonghou, the production team leader of Caocun in Wuxiang County, said, "Paper and pen can speak for a thousand years, and creating experience will be passed down forever," and said that summarizing experience can not only solve current problems, but also promote a greater leap forward this year.
　　Through mass investigation and summarization, all skepticism, conditionalism, and conservatives were refuted with vivid facts. At the same time, it was also a vivid self-education for the masses, which further strengthened their confidence and determination to leap forward in the future. The masses of Chengguan Commune in Wuxiang said well: "Summarizing experience is of great use. Good things can be promoted, shortcomings can be improved, the more summaries, the more methods, and the brighter the heart." In addition, it also stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and peasants and improved the leadership style. For example, a salesman of the Department Store in Changzhi City wrote "Starting from a Dry Tobacco Pouch" in the movement, and put forward the necessity of operating small commodities to the leadership. The Party branch of the company believes that although the problem he raised is small, it pointed out the direction of business department operation, thereby improving the leadership style and establishing the view of relying on the masses and believing in the masses.
　　The movement of mass investigation and summarization has also greatly promoted the mass movement of learning culture and learning theory, and promoted the in-depth development of the cultural and technological revolution. The broad masses of Yangcheng County generally realized the importance of learning culture and learning theory. An Zhixiang, a porter in the Chengguan Town porter team, said: "Without culture, you can't sing by yourself, and without theory, the articles you write are not like." The conclusion drawn by the masses of Shicheng People's Commune in Huguan County from this movement is: "Articles can be written if you write, and culture can be improved if you practice."

    找出跃进规律乘胜前进
    晋东南总结大跃进经验收效巨大
    推动了当前各项工作及时推广了先进经验
    本报讯　山西晋东南地区全党全民调查研究总结大跃进经验，已经开花结果。通过全民调查研究总结，找出了许多好的经验，对推动当前工作、争取今年更大的跃进有很大帮助。
    为了总结1958年大跃进的经验，探索大跃进的规律，中共山西省晋东南地委，于去年10月19日发出关于开展全党全民调查研究、总结1958年大跃进经验的决定以后，全区立即掀起了一个调查与总结1958年大跃进运动的热潮。参加这一运动的有一百七十余万人。其中有老干部、新干部，也有工人、农民、士兵和学生。他们自编自写，自己总结自己创造出来的经验，写出各种调查报告、经验总结，很多经验并已编写成书。其中，有总结农业增产经验的，有长达十三万字的惠丰机械厂工人集体创作的“电镀工艺学”和“自动工艺学”，有惠丰机械厂青年工人李宝珍创作的“冲压工艺学”，有潞安煤矿职工集体创作的“矿工起义”和解放后该矿五阳坑口“九年无事故的经验”等。在群众运动推动下，许多老中医把久不外传的经验也总结写出来了。襄垣镇中医秦子兴将祖传治疗淋巴腺炎的秘方写出来后，得到了大家的称赞。
    通过全民调查总结，系统的总结了各方面的具体经验和具体规律，找到了工作的关键，推动了当前各项工作。如对农业增产经验的总结，对水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管的“八字宪法”，都根据自己地区的具体条件和经验作了具体总结。壶关镇八个人民公社，以去年一万五千八百亩麦地的增产经验与过去的减产教训做了对比，大大推动了冬季麦田管理。这个县依靠群众总结了农业增产经验，从而找出了在气候高寒的山区贯彻执行“八字宪法”的一般规律，以及各个公社在运用这些规律时应注意的具体特点，并在这个基础上，确定了今年的跃进计划。由于这样，计划也订得较好，既有大胆的奋斗目标，又有充分的措施作保证。
    通过群众性的调查总结，许多好的经验及时得到推广。如壶关总结了深翻地的十大好处和四大经验以后，很快在全县推广，使四十五万亩基本农田又快又好地完成了深翻。晋城柳树口公社党委书记梁广林同志，发现羊工赵四小所放的羊交配后全部怀了胎，其中有六只羊怀了双胎，就及时地推广他的经验。群众把写总结看成是一件荣誉的事情，如武乡县曹村生产队长贾忠厚说：“纸笔千年会说话，创造经验万古传”，并说总结经验不仅能解决当前问题，而且又能推动今年更大跃进。
    通过群众性的调查总结，用活生生的事实驳倒了一切怀疑论、唯条件论和保守派。同时，对群众也是一次生动的自我教育，更加坚定了他们今后跃进的信心和决心。武乡城关公社群众说得好：“总结经验作用大，好的能推广，缺点能改进，越总结办法越多，心里就越明亮。”另外，还激发了工农群众的积极性、创造性，改进了领导作风。如长治市百货公司营业员在运动中写出“从一支旱烟袋说起”，向领导上提出经营小百货的必要性。该公司党支部认为他提出的问题虽小，却指出了商业部门经营的方针，从而改进了领导作风，树立起依靠群众相信群众的观点。
    全民调查总结的运动，还大大地推动了全民学文化、学理论运动，促进了文化技术革命的深入开展。阳城县广大群众普遍认识到学文化学理论的重要意义。城关镇搬运队的一个搬运工人安志祥说：“没文化不能自打自唱，没理论写出文章也不像样”。壶关县石城人民公社群众，从此次运动中得出的结论是：“文章写就会，文化练就高”。
