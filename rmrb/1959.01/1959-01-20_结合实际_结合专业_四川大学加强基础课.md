Combining Theory with Practice and Specialization
Sichuan University Strengthens Basic Courses
　　
This dispatch from Chengdu, January 19th, by our reporter Zhou Zuyou: Sichuan University is taking measures from all aspects, including teaching content and teaching methods, to vigorously improve and strengthen basic courses, so that students can learn the more in-depth and extensive basic knowledge necessary for their major.

In order to better adapt to the requirements of professional courses and improve teaching quality, Sichuan University, in its revision of the teaching plan in the previous period, conducted a comprehensive study on the opening of basic courses and the reform of teaching content in each department. Each department added some new basic courses closely related to practice, and streamlined and merged certain contents that were repetitive or not closely related to the major. The History Department established a new basic course on the History of the People's Republic of China. The Chemistry Department, based on the current development direction of chemical analysis, added a course on Instrument Measurement and Application to help students master new knowledge that has been widely used in practical work.

In terms of teaching content, teachers of basic courses pay attention to linking with practice as much as possible. In addition to professional basic courses, general basic courses such as foreign languages, physics, chemistry, and mathematics are also more closely integrated with the needs of the relevant majors. For example, biophysics and biochemistry in the Biology Department not only teach basic theories according to their own scientific system, but also adapt to the needs of various majors in the Biology Department, focusing on the content related to physiological functions. The mathematics course for first-year students in the Physics Department, because students will soon learn theoretical mechanics and need knowledge of calculus, etc., will teach this content in advance.

Each department has also taken a series of measures to change the old teaching methods of basic courses, so that students can learn knowledge more deeply and firmly. These new teaching methods roughly include the following: (1) a combination of previewing, focusing on key points, self-study, discussion and debate, and summarization; (2) combining production tasks with basic course experiments, teaching necessary theoretical knowledge while completing production tasks, and supplementing with more concentrated lectures on basic theoretical issues and specialized issues; (3) combining indoor concentrated lectures on basic theoretical parts with on-site teaching. These methods have reversed the past situation where basic course teaching was seriously divorced from reality, and can also cultivate students' ability to think and work independently, preparing better conditions for specialized course learning.

In order to improve and strengthen basic courses, the departments of Sichuan University have also made many improvements in the organization and leadership of teaching work. Party organizations in departments such as Physics and Biology also regularly organize forums for basic course teachers to study and put forward specific requirements for the teaching content of basic courses according to the needs of their majors; continuously educate teachers and students to help them correctly understand the relationship between theory and practice, basic courses and professional courses; and send professional course teachers to help basic course teachers tutor students; many basic course teachers also actively audit professional courses and learn relevant professional knowledge, so that basic course teaching can be more closely linked to practice and adapt to the different needs of each major.

After taking the above series of measures, the teaching quality of many basic courses in each department of Sichuan University has been significantly improved, and the knowledge learned by students has become more solid.

### 结合实际　结合专业  四川大学加强基础课

    结合实际　结合专业
    四川大学加强基础课
    本报成都19日电　记者周祖佑报道：四川大学从教学内容、教学方法等各方面采取措施，大力改进和加强基础课程，使学生们能够学习到本专业所必需的更加深入和广博的基础知识。
    四川大学为了更好地适应专业课程的要求，提高教学质量，在前一时期修订教学计划中，各系对基础课的开设和教学内容的改革等方面，都作了全面的研究。各系增设了一些与实际紧密联系的新的基础课，并对彼此重复和与专业关系不大的某些内容，作了精简和合并。历史系新设了中华人民共和国史基础课。化学系根据化学分析上目前发展方向，增设了仪器测量与应用课，帮助学生掌握在实际工作中已经广泛应用的新知识。
    在教学内容上，各基础课教师注意尽量联系实际。除了专业基础课外，外国语、物理、化学、数学等一般基础课，也与各有关专业的需要结合得更加密切了。如生物系的生物物理、生物化学，不仅按照本身的科学系统性讲授基本理论，还适应生物系各专业需要，着重讲授有关生理机能方面的内容。物理系一年级的数学课，因学生即将学习理论力学，需要微积分等方面的知识，就提前讲授这方面的内容。
    各系还采取一系列办法，改变基础课的旧教学方法，使学生学到的知识更加深入和巩固。这些新教学方法，大体上有以下几种：（1）预习、重点讲授、自学、讨论争辩和总结等几个环节相结合的方法；
  （2）把生产任务和基础课实验结合起来，在完成生产任务中讲授必要的理论知识，并辅以较为集中的基本理论问题和专门问题的讲授；（3）把室内集中讲授基本理论部分和现场教学结合起来。这些办法扭转了过去基础课教学严重脱离实际的情况，又能培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力，为专门化课程的学习准备了更好的条件。
    为了改进和加强基础课程，四川大学各系在教学工作的组织领导上，也进行了许多改进。物理、生物等系党组织还经常组织基础课教师座谈研究，按本专业需要对基础课教学内容提出具体要求；不断对师生进行教育，帮助他们正确理解理论与实践、基础课与专业课的关系；并派专业课教师帮助基础课教师辅导学生学习；许多基础课教师也主动旁听专业课，学习有关的专业知识，这样，基础课教学更能联系实际，适应各专业的不同需要。
    四川大学在采取以上一系列措施后，各系不少基础课程教学质量都有显著提高，学生们学得的知识更加巩固了。
