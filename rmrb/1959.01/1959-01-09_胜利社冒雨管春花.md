According to Zhejiang Daily: Members of the Victory People's Commune in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, enthusiastically discussed the "Ten Proposals," and expressed their willingness to respond to these proposals with practical actions to improve the cultivation and management of spring flowering crops, especially the current fertilization, frost prevention and warmth preservation work for spring flowers.

After seeing the news of the "Ten Proposals" in the newspaper, the commune members were greatly encouraged. Xu Guanfu, the captain of the Third Production Team of the Victory Brigade, said: "To achieve the target of 2,000 jin of grain per capita, as required by the 'Ten Proposals', we must strengthen the cultivation and management of spring flowers, and do a good job in fertilization, frost prevention, ditching and soil cultivation."

The "Ten Proposals" have become the driving force for the members of this commune to improve the management of spring flowers. More than 21,000 mu of the commune's 37,000 mu of spring flowers have been covered with grass or mud, and more than 31,000 mu have been fertilized with cattle, sheep, and pig manure to keep them warm. In order to do a better job in frost prevention, the commune members worked in the rain, concentrating their efforts on the second ditching and soil cultivation of the spring flower fields.

    胜利社冒雨管春花
    据浙江日报消息　浙江平湖县胜利人民公社社员热烈讨论了“十大倡议”，纷纷表示要以搞好春花作物培育管理工作，特别是当前的春花施肥、防冻保暖工作的实际行动来响应这一倡议。
    社员们在报上看到“十大倡议”的消息后，受到了很大鼓舞。胜利大队第三生产队队长徐关福说：“要实现‘十大倡议’要求的按城乡人口平均每人有两千斤粮食的指标，当前必须加强春花的培育管理，做好施肥、防冻、开沟培土等工作。
    “十大倡议”成为这个社社员搞好春花管理的动力，全公社三万七千多亩春花已盖草、盖泥二万一千亩，施牛、羊、猪肥保暖三万一千多亩，为了把防冻工作做得更好，社员们冒雨出工，集中力量进行春花田第二次开沟培土。
