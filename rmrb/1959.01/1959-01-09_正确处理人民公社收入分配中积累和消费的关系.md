Correctly Handle the Relationship Between Accumulation and Consumption in Income Distribution of People's Communes
Yang Bo

Recently, rural people's communes in various regions have been arranging and handling the income distribution for 1958. This is a major event and also a very complex one. Whether this matter is handled well or not is related to the consolidation of the people's communes, the development of commune production, and the lives of every commune member.

1958 was a year of unprecedented great leap forward in agricultural production in our country. The income of people's communes in various regions has increased significantly compared with the past. This situation not only provides a much more abundant material basis for improving the lives of commune members, but also provides a greater possibility for expanding commune accumulation and increasing the proportion of accumulation in net income. The key question is how to distribute correctly and how to correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption.

Two Factors Determining the Increase in Accumulation and the Speed of Consumption Improvement

As everyone knows, the amount of accumulation and the speed of consumption improvement are mainly determined by two factors: (1) Determined by production, which is fundamental. Only when production develops rapidly and income increases greatly, is it possible to both increase consumption and greatly increase accumulation. In the past few years, due to the average annual growth rate of agricultural production being around 5%, the extent of improvement in farmers' lives and the amount and growth rate of accumulation were limited. The accumulation rate of agricultural cooperatives in various regions generally accounted for only about 10% of net income. The situation in 1958 was different. The growth rate of agricultural production in various regions was not a few percent, a dozen percent, but several tens of percent, a hundred percent, or even more. Thus, it is possible to both ensure further improvement in farmers' lives and appropriately increase accumulation. (2) Determined by distribution. In the development of production, it is necessary to ensure that farmers' lives gradually improve; it is wrong to only pay attention to expanding accumulation and not pay attention to improving consumption, which is not conducive to the consolidation of people's communes and the further development of production. However, since the requirements for improving life are unlimited, and the growth of income is limited in a certain period, if we do not pay attention to correct distribution, if we do not arrange consumption according to the principle that farmers' lives can only be improved gradually, but instead try to improve life in one step, then accumulation will still not be able to have a larger and faster growth, which is equally not conducive to the consolidation of people's communes and the further development of production.

What principles should be followed to handle the income distribution of people's communes? The "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "Rural people's communes should correctly distribute their income under the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally. In order to rapidly develop production, after deducting production costs, management costs, and taxes from the total income, the proportion of accumulation should be appropriately increased. However, on the basis of production development, the part of income used for individual consumption and collective consumption of commune members (including the part used for public welfare, cultural and educational undertakings, etc.) should be increased year by year, and the people's lives should be improved year by year." That is to say, it is necessary to appropriately expand accumulation, increase the proportion of accumulation in net income, and ensure the supply of funds and materials needed for expanded reproduction of the commune. At the same time, it is necessary to appropriately increase the consumption of commune members, and generally ensure that the income of more than 90% of commune members increases compared with the previous year, and the income of the remaining commune members does not decrease compared with the previous year.

Cannot Unilaterally Emphasize Expanding Commune Accumulation and Neglect Improving the Consumption of Commune Members

There are different views on this issue. Some comrades only emphasize expanding commune accumulation and do not pay attention to improving the lives of farmers. They believe that 1958 is the first year of three years of hard work, and the past "family assets" are very weak. The increased production should be used more for expanding accumulation, and there is no need to rush to improve life; after the production level is greatly improved, life will naturally improve. Is this idea correct? It is completely right and necessary to pay attention to expanding accumulation and developing production. The problem is that we cannot only focus on this aspect, but also pay attention to improving life and appropriately increasing consumption. Chairman Mao told us: "During the three years of hard work, accumulation should not be too much. It is necessary to make the peasants more and more interested in working, and more and more energetic." (See "Chairman Mao in Hubei" published in the fifth issue of "July 1" in 1958) Therefore, we should pay attention to both expanding accumulation and improving consumption, and grasp both production and life. Only in this way can we correctly handle the income distribution of people's communes, and further promote the development of production through distribution.

In the Future for a Certain Period, the Growth Rate of Consumption Should be Slower Than the Growth Rate of Accumulation

There are also some comrades who believe that with the great leap forward in production, there should also be a great leap forward in life; only paying attention to improving life and not paying attention to expanding accumulation is also incorrect. The reason why it is incorrect is that these comrades overestimate the current level of political and ideological awareness of the farmers, as if only by giving more encouragement in terms of material things can we arouse the enthusiasm of the farmers and stimulate their initiative in production, which is obviously not in line with the facts; second, these comrades regard expanding accumulation and improving consumption as two absolutely opposed things, and do not see that there is a contradictory side and also a unified side, and fundamentally speaking, the two are completely consistent. To expand accumulation, it is necessary to plan and control consumption; appropriately increasing accumulation today is precisely for the purpose of improving consumption faster tomorrow; for the long-term interests of the commune members, we cannot only care about the immediate interests, we must combine the two, and the growth rate of consumption should be slower than the growth rate of accumulation. Only in this way is it conducive to accelerating the development of production, conducive to fundamentally changing the face of the countryside as soon as possible, and thus more conducive to continuously improving the lives of farmers.

How should the proportion of accumulation and consumption be arranged to be appropriate? Since the production, income, and living standards of commune members vary from people's commune to people's commune, it is impossible and should not make a uniform and rigid stipulation. It must be flexibly grasped according to the specific circumstances and local conditions. Due to the different situations of each people's commune, some have a higher proportion of accumulation, and some have a lower proportion of accumulation. A proportion that is completely appropriate for one commune may not be appropriate for another commune. That is to say, there is no and cannot be a fixed and unchangeable proportion for the distribution of accumulation and consumption that is applicable to any situation. It can only be specifically arranged according to the different production conditions and the living conditions of commune members in each commune. Whether the distribution ratio of accumulation and consumption is appropriate does not depend on how much each accounts for in percentage terms. The only standard is to see whether the result of the distribution ensures both the universal improvement of the lives of commune members and the necessary accumulation of the commune.

Some comrades may ask: According to this, how should the life of commune members be arranged to be appropriate? What standard should be used to measure that the income of more than 90% of commune members has increased compared with the previous year? Generally speaking, at present, the arrangement of the lives of commune members can be considered based on the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants in the past. Those who have already exceeded the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants can generally not increase or increase less for the time being, and can mainly make some improvements in terms of collective welfare; those who are already close to the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants should not increase too much. In principle, it is advisable to increase to the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants; those whose current living standard is still lower than the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants can gradually increase to the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants according to the specific circumstances such as the production, income, and needs of expanding production of the whole commune. Of course, the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants in the past are not completely the same everywhere. Some places are higher and some places are lower. If the lives of well-to-do middle peasants in some places were indeed very low in the past, and at present, under the condition that expanding accumulation and developing production are not affected, it is possible and necessary to raise the lives of commune members to exceed the average living standard of the local well-to-do middle peasants, it is also possible, depending on the specific circumstances.

Three Issues That Must Be Paid Attention To When Arranging the Lives and Incomes of Commune Members

In addition, there are the following new situations in various people's communes that are worth noting when specifically arranging the lives and incomes of commune members.

First, in the past, the income distributed by agricultural production cooperatives to commune members generally adopted the "distribution according to labor" system of distribution according to workdays, that is, the number of workdays made by each commune member in a year was converted into physical objects and currency according to the value of workdays, and distributed to commune members at one time at the end of the year (there was a pre-distribution after the summer harvest). How commune members used their personal income was entirely arranged by themselves. Now it is different. People's communes in various regions generally implement a distribution system that combines the wage system and the supply system. Although this distribution system is basically still socialist in nature of "distribution according to labor," it already has the bud of communist "distribution according to need." This major change in the distribution system has caused changes in the use of all consumer funds of commune members: the wage part is issued to commune members by the commune on time, and the commune members arrange the use; most of the supply part is not issued to commune members, but is centrally controlled by the commune and used for the living consumption of commune members. In this way, there are three issues worth noting in the distribution and use of consumer funds: (1) The proportion of the wage part and the supply part should be reasonably arranged. According to the experience of some people's communes in various regions, at present, in the income distribution of the commune, in order to ensure that the proportion of accumulation is appropriately increased and that the income of more than 90% of the commune members is increased, the proportion of the supply part should not be too large, and the scope of the package should not be too wide. It is generally appropriate to only include "eating without money." If the scope of the package is too wide and the proportion of the supply part is too large, the result will either reduce accumulation or make it difficult to ensure that the income of more than 90% of the commune members increases. (2) Collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly should be effectively run. "It is necessary to ensure that all commune members eat enough, eat well, eat cleanly and hygienically, and that it is suitable for national and local customs." ("Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes") Make everyone who eats in the canteen feel better than eating at home, and make every child live better and be better educated than at home. (3) When comparing the income changes of each commune member in 1958 with 1957, we cannot simply compare the personal income of commune members in 1958 directly with 1957. We should add the consumer funds of the wage and supply parts that were left in the commune at the end of 1958 and prepared for expenditure to commune members in the first half of 1959, together with the income already distributed to commune members in 1958, to compare with 1957. Only in this way can we accurately explain the changes in the personal income of commune members. Because in fact, a large part of the personal income of commune members in the past was also used for consumption in the first half of the second year. The only difference is that in the past, this part of consumer funds was distributed to commune members before the year, but now it is left in the commune for centralized control and used in stages. This point should be made clear to commune members. Otherwise, it is very likely that the income of commune members in 1958 actually increased, but it seems to be reduced on the surface.

Second, in the past two years, although most of the total income of commune members came from within the commune, personal sideline income also accounted for a considerable proportion, generally accounting for 20% to 30%. Now it is different. Some remnants of individual ownership of the means of production that were retained in the original agricultural production cooperatives, such as private plots, self-operated orchards, etc., have basically been transferred to commune ownership in the process of communization; all labor force is also basically uniformly arranged and deployed by the commune. This change in production relations makes the personal income of commune members basically all taken from within the commune. This is a new situation that needs to be considered when people's communes distribute the personal income of commune members and arrange their lives.

Third, the people's commune is formed by the merger of several smaller agricultural production cooperatives in the past. Due to the different economic foundations of the original agricultural cooperatives, the production development is unbalanced, the income varies, and the lives of commune members are high and low. Now, it is necessary to distribute the income of the whole commune in a unified manner, which brings many new problems that need to be planned and handled properly.

In summary, it can be seen that the issue of the distribution of accumulation and consumption is a very complex issue that must be resolved reasonably, but it is not easy to resolve completely reasonably all at once. Like other things, it is also a unity of opposites. The two are fundamentally unified; but there are also contradictions. Accumulation basically represents the collective interests and long-term interests of commune members, while consumption represents the personal interests and current interests of commune members; to increase accumulation and strive for more developed production and a better life in the future, we must plan to control current consumption, which is the contradictory side. As accumulation increases, production continues to leap forward, and the personal consumption of commune members can be continuously improved, and there will be more sufficient material guarantee, which is the unified side. When we actually handle the income distribution of people's communes, we must put politics in command, follow the mass line, be good at proceeding from specific circumstances, and correctly combine the collective interests and long-term interests of commune members with personal interests and current interests in an organic way.

    正确处理人民公社收入分配中积累和消费的关系
    杨波
    最近，各地农村人民公社，都在安排、处理1958年的收入分配问题。这是一件大事，也是一件很复杂的事。这件事处理得好不好，关系到人民公社的巩固，公社生产的发展和每个社员的生活。
    1958年，是我国农业生产空前大跃进的一年，各地人民公社的收入，都比过去显著地增加了。这种情况，不仅为提高社员生活提供了远比过去丰足的物质基础，而且也为扩大公社积累、提高积累在纯收入中所占比重，提供了较大的可能性。问题的关键，在于如何正确分配，正确处理积累和消费的关系。
    决定积累增加多少和消费提高快慢的两个因素
    大家知道，积累的多少和消费提高的快慢，主要决定于两个因素：（1）决定于生产，这是基本的。只有生产迅速发展了，收入大大增加了，才既有可能提高消费，又有可能大大增加积累。过去几年，由于农业生产增长速度每年平均为5％左右，农民生活提高的幅度以及积累的数量和增长速度，受到了限制，各地农业社的积累率一般只占纯收入的10％左右。1958年的情况不同了，各地农业生产的增长速度，不是百分之几、十几，而是百分之几十，百分之百，甚至更多，这样，就有可能既保证农民生活进一步的提高，又能适当增加积累。（2）决定于分配。在生产发展中，必须保证农民的生活逐步有所提高；只注意扩大积累，不注意提高消费，是不对的，不利于人民公社的巩固和生产的进一步发展。但是，由于生活改善的要求是无限的，而收入的增长在一定时期内是有限的，如果不注意正确的分配，如果不是根据农民生活只能逐步提高的原则来安排消费，而是生活来个一步登天，那么，积累依然不可能有较多、较快的增长，这同样不利于人民公社的巩固和生产的进一步发展。
    应该本着什么原则来处理人民公社的收入分配问题呢？中共八届六中全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中指出：“农村的人民公社应当在勤俭办社的原则下，正确地分配自己的收入。为了迅速地发展生产，在从总收入扣除生产费用、管理费用和缴纳税款以后，应当适当地提高积累的比例。但是在生产发展的基础上，同时应当使收入中用于社员个人消费和集体消费的部分（包括用于公共福利、文化教育等事业的部分）逐年有所增加，使人民的生活逐年有所改善。”这就是说，既要适当扩大积累，提高积累在纯收入中所占比重，保证公社扩大再生产所需要的资金和物资供应，又要适当提高社员的消费，一般地要使90％以上的社员收入比上年有所增加，其余社员的收入比上年也不致减少。
    不能片面强调扩大公社的积累忽视提高社员的消费
    在这个问题上，是有不同看法的。一部分同志，只强调扩大公社积累，不注意改善农民生活。他们认为，1958年是苦战三年的第一年，过去的“家底”又很单薄，应该把增产的部分多多用于扩大积累，不要忙于改善生活；以后生产水平大大提高了，生活自然也就会提高。这种想法对不对？注意扩大积累、发展生产，是完全应该的、必要的，问题在于不能只抓这一面，还必须注意改善生活、适当提高消费的一面。毛主席告诉我们说：“在苦战三年当中，积累不可过多，必须使农民越干越有味道，越干越有劲。”（见“七一”1958年第五期所载“毛主席在湖北”一文）因此应该既注意扩大积累，又注意提高消费，既抓生产，又抓生活。只有这样，才能正确处理人民公社的收入分配，才能通过分配进一步促进生产的发展。
    在今后一定时期内，消费增长的速度应该慢于积累增长的速度
    还有一部分同志，认为生产大跃进，生活也应来个大跃进；只注意改善生活，不注意扩大积累，这也是不对的。所以不对，一是这些同志把现今农民的政治思想觉悟水平，估计得太低了，好像只有从物质方面多加鼓励，才能鼓起农民的干劲，才能激起农民的生产积极性，这显然是不符合事实的；二是这些同志把扩大积累和提高消费，看成是绝对对立的两件事情，没有看到其中有矛盾的一面，也有统一的一面，而且从根本上说，两者是完全一致的。要扩大积累，就要有计划地控制消费；今天适当地增加积累，正是为了明天更快地提高消费；为了社员的长远利益，就不能只管眼前利益，必须把二者结合起来，消费增长的速度应该慢于积累增长的速度。只有这样，才有利于加速发展生产，有利于尽快地从根本上改变农村面貌，从而也就更有利于不断地提高农民生活。
    积累和消费的比例到底怎样安排才算适当呢？由于各个人民公社的生产、收入和社员生活水平等各不相同，不可能也不应该作出一个统一的硬性规定，必须根据具体情况，因地制宜地灵活掌握。由于各个人民公社的情况不同，有的积累的比例高一些，有的积累的比例低一些。对一个公社完全适当的比例，对另一个公社未必适当。这就是说，积累和消费的分配，并没有也不可能有一个适用于任何情况的、固定不变的比例，只能根据各个公社的不同的生产情况和社员生活情况来具体安排。衡量积累和消费的分配比例是否妥当，不在于两者的百分比各占多少，唯一标准是看分配的结果，是否既保证了社员生活普遍有所提高，又保证了公社的必要积累。
    有的同志可能会问：照这样说来，那么，社员的生活到底怎样安排才算适当呢？要使90％以上的社员收入比上年有所增加，应该用什么标准来衡量呢？一般说来，目前安排社员的生活，可以按当地过去的富裕中农的平均生活水平为标准来考虑，凡是目前已经超过当地富裕中农平均生活水平的，一般可暂时不提高或提高得少一些，主要可从集体福利方面作些改善；凡是已经接近当地富裕中农的平均生活水平的，不应再过多地提高，原则上以提高到当地富裕中农的平均生活水平为宜；凡是目前社员生活还低于当地富裕中农平均生活的，则可根据全社的生产、收入以及扩大生产的需要等具体情况，逐步提高到当地富裕中农的平均生活水平。当然，各地过去富裕中农的生活水平并不是完全一样的，有的地方高些，有的地方低些；如果有的地方过去富裕中农的生活确实很低，而且目前社内在不影响扩大积累、发展生产的条件下，又有可能和必要把社员的生活提高到超过当地富裕中农的平均生活水平的，也是可以的，这要看具体情况而定。
    在安排社员的生活和收入时，必须注意的三个问题
    此外，各地人民公社在具体安排社员的生活、收入时，还有以下几个新的情况值得注意。
    首先，过去农业生产合作社分配给社员的收入，一般都是采用按劳动日进行分配的“按劳分配”制度，即按每一社员一年所作的劳动日数，按劳动日分值折成实物和货币，在年终决算时一次分配给社员（夏收后有一次预分）。至于社员个人收入怎样使用，完全由其自己自行安排。现在不同了，各地人民公社一般都实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度。这一分配制度，虽然基本上还是社会主义的“按劳分配”的性质，但已具有共产主义的“按需分配”的萌芽。分配制度上的这种重大变革，在社员全部消费基金的使用方面，引起的变化是：工资部分，由社里按时发给社员个人，由社员自己安排用途；供给部分，大都是不发给社员个人，而由社里集中掌握，统一使用于社员的生活消费。这样，在消费基金的分配、使用方面，就有三个问题值得我们注意：（1）要合理安排工资部分和供给部分的比例。根据各地部分人民公社的经验看来，在目前，在公社收入分配中，要做到既能保证适当提高积累的比例，又能使90％以上的社员增加收入，供给部分所占比例不宜过大，包的范围不宜过宽，一般以只包“吃饭不要钱”为适宜。如果包的范围过宽，供给部分所占比例过大，其结果，不是减少了积累，就是难于保证90％以上的社员增加收入。（2）要切实办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院等集体福利事业。“要保证所有的社员吃得饱、吃得好、吃得干净卫生，并且适合民族习惯和地方习惯。”（“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”）使每一个在食堂吃饭的人都感到比在家里吃饭还好，使每一个孩子都比在家里生活得好、教育得好。（3）在比较每一社员1958年同1957年的收入变化情况时，不能简单地把1958年社员个人的收入直接同1957年比较，应该把1958年底留在社里的准备用于1959年上半年开支给社员的工资和供给部分的消费基金，连同1958年已经分配给社员个人的收入加在一起，来同1957年比较。只有这样，才能确切地说明社员个人收入的变化情况。因为事实上过去社员个人每年的收入，也有很大一部分是用于第二年上半年消费的，所不同的只是过去这一部分消费基金都在年前分配给社员个人，现在则留在公社里集中掌握，分期使用。这一点，应该向社员讲清楚。否则，很有可能出现这样的情况：1958年社员的收入实际上增加了，表面算来却减少了。
    其次，过去两年，社员的全部收入中，虽然大部分取自社内，但个人副业收入也占相当比重，一般皆占百分之二、三十。现在不同了，原来农业生产合作社中还保留的生产资料个体所有制的某些残余，如自留地、自营的成片果树等等，在人民公社化过程中，都已基本上转为社有；全部劳动力也基本上都由社内统一安排、调配。生产关系上的这种变化，使社员个人的收入，基本上都全部取自社内。这是人民公社在分配社员个人收入、安排社员生活时，需要考虑的一个新的情况。
    再次，人民公社是由过去的若干个规模较小的农业生产合作社合并成立的，由于原来的各个农业社的经济基础不同，生产发展不平衡，收入有多有少，社员生活有高有低，现在要将全社的收入统一进行分配，就带来许多新的问题，需要统筹安排，妥善处理。
    综上所述，可以看出，积累和消费的分配问题，是一个很复杂的问题，一定要解决得合理，但也不容易一下子解决得完全合理。它同其它事物一样，也是对立的统一。两者之间，从根本上说是统一的；但也有矛盾。积累基本上代表着社员的集体利益和长远利益，消费代表着社员的个人利益和目前利益；要增加积累，要争取今后的生产更发达，生活更美好，就要有计划地控制目前的消费，这就是矛盾的一面。积累增加了，生产不断跃进，社员个人的消费才有可能不断提高，才有更加充分的物质保证，这又是统一的一面。我们在实际处理人民公社的收入分配问题时，必须政治挂帅，走群众路线，善于从具体情况出发，正确地把社员的集体利益、长远利益和个人利益、目前利益有机地结合起来。
