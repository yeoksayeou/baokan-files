　　Talking About Support

　　Supporting key projects is a construction principle of our country. Spring planting, autumn harvest; the whole country supports Anshan Iron and Steel, yielding the result of Anshan Iron and Steel supporting the whole country. With the development of Anshan Iron and Steel's construction, this fruit becomes more abundant year by year, and more and more production and construction units receive the support of Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of manpower and materials. According to reports, in the past year alone, Anshan Iron and Steel transferred 10,000 cadres and workers to support the production and construction of the iron and steel industry in 25 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country (January 14th, this newspaper). Today, there is news that more than a dozen rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel are striving to roll out steel products with larger output, better quality, and more varieties than last year, to meet the needs of the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction across the country. It seems that the scale of Anshan Iron and Steel's support to the whole country is getting larger and larger.

　　The whole country supporting Anshan Iron and Steel is the cause, and Anshan Iron and Steel supporting the whole country is the effect. However, this cause-and-effect relationship is not a reflection of moral concepts such as "reciprocity" or "returning a favor." The whole country supporting Anshan Iron and Steel and Anshan Iron and Steel supporting the whole country reflect the objective process of the interrelationship and development between the key and the general. The key is not something designated by any one person, but an objective existence in social life. Enterprises like Anshan Iron and Steel, with an annual output of several million tons of steel, can support the whole country with strong material resources, and are also a university for cultivating technical forces, capable of supporting iron and steel enterprises across the country with strong manpower, having a pivotal influence on the construction of the national iron and steel industry, therefore it is a key project. Supporting key projects is not a preference of any one person, but a need of objective reality. The construction of key projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel requires thousands of types of equipment and materials, and thousands of workers; its production requires a large amount of raw materials and fuel, as well as thousands of workers. These cannot be solved by the support of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel themselves and a few enterprises, but require the support of the whole country. Only when the whole country supports the key projects and builds them up, can the key projects support the whole country.

　　Anshan Iron and Steel is like this, and Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and other key projects are no exception. To receive support from key projects, one must first support key projects; having supported key projects, one will definitely receive support from key projects.

### 谈支援

    谈支援
    支援重点，这是我们国家的一条建设方针。春种秋收，全国支援鞍钢结出鞍钢支援全国之果。随着鞍钢建设的发展，这果一年比一年丰硕，一年比一年有更多的生产建设单位得到鞍钢人力和物力的支援。报载：仅去年一年，鞍钢就抽调了一万名干部和工人，支援了全国二十五个省、市和自治区钢铁工业的生产建设（1月14日本报）。今天又有消息说，鞍钢十几个轧钢厂正力争轧制出比去年产量大、质量好、品种多的钢材，满足全国工农业生产建设更大跃进的需要。看来，鞍钢支援全国的规模是越来越大了。
    全国支援鞍钢是因，鞍钢支援全国是果。但这因果关系，却并非
  “礼尚往来”、“投桃报李”之类道德观念的反映。全国支援鞍钢，鞍钢支援全国，反映了重点和一般之间的相互关系及其发展的客观过程。重点，不是哪一个人封的，而是社会生活的客观存在。像鞍钢这样的企业，年产几百万吨钢，能以雄厚的物力支援全国，又是一个培养技术力量的大学校，能以强大的人力支援全国各地的钢铁企业，对全国的钢铁工业的建设有举足轻重的影响，故为重点。支援重点，也不是哪一个人的偏爱，而是客观实际的需要。像鞍钢、武钢、包钢这样的重点，它的建设，需要成千上万种设备和材料，需要成千上万的工人；它的生产，需要大量的原料和燃料，也需要成千上万的工人。这些，都不是鞍钢、武钢、包钢自己和少数几个企业的支援所能解决的，而需要全国的支援。只有全国支援重点，把重点建设起来，重点才能支援全国。
    鞍钢是如此，武钢、包钢以及其他重点工程也无一不是如此。要得到重点的支援，必先支援重点；支援了重点，必能从重点得到支援。
