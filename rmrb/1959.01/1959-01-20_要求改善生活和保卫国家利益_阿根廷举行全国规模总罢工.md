Xinhua News Agency, January 19th, Buenos Aires Dispatch: On the eve of Argentine President Frondizi's visit to the United States, a nationwide general strike has paralyzed Argentina. The sixty-two trade unions and thirty-two trade unions of the two major trade union systems in Argentina successively announced general strikes on the 17th and 18th, supporting the strike of workers at the state-owned slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant and opposing the government's economic policies. Industrial and commercial employees, including postal and telecommunications workers, food workers, freight workers, electricity workers, civil servants, journalists, and printers, have all been involved in the strike.

    The news said that the nationwide general strike was triggered by the government's suppression of the strike by 6,000 workers at the state-owned slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant. Workers at this factory strongly opposed the government's transfer of the factory to American monopoly capital for operation. Before the government dispersed and arrested the striking refrigeration plant workers, the workers had occupied the factory buildings of the state-owned slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant since the 15th, erected signs reading "The slaughterhouse will remain Argentine," and shouted slogans of "No giving in to the Americans!"

    After the government arrested the refrigeration plant workers, the sixty-two trade unions immediately announced an indefinite general strike on the 17th. The sixty-two trade unions' strike statement said that the government's "economic stabilization plan" will "lower the living standards of the working class and complete the process of turning the country into a colony." The statement pointed out that Argentine workers "will never agree to sell out the country's spiritual and material wealth." Subsequently, the thirty-two trade unions in Argentina also announced a forty-eight-hour general strike on the 18th in solidarity with the workers of the slaughterhouse and refrigeration plant, while expressing firm protest against the government's "unreliable economic stabilization plan built on the suffering of the poor." Workers and staff of other trade unions in Argentina also announced strikes at the same time.

    According to reports, the Argentine government's "economic stabilization plan" was announced by President Frondizi on December 29th of last year. Its central content is to abolish the official exchange rate between the peso and the dollar as a condition for obtaining American loans, and at the same time abolish restrictions and quotas on imports. Some Argentine newspapers pointed out that the above measures will enable American importers and exporters to obtain greater profits and greatly facilitate the dumping of foreign goods into Argentina. Shortly after President Frondizi announced the "economic stabilization plan," various prices in Argentina immediately soared, and the Argentine working people were forced to launch strike struggles again to demand improved living conditions and defend national interests.

    According to a Reuters report on the 18th, Argentina is taking tough measures to deal with striking workers. The government has declared all strikes illegal. The announcement declaring the strike illegal said that workers will not be paid for the days they are on strike. The government also announced that it will re-enlist demobilized soldiers born in 1937 and ordered new recruits on vacation to return to barracks. Another report said that the Argentine police局 (Police Department) confiscated the "Times," the organ of the Argentine Communist Party, on the 18th.

### 要求改善生活和保卫国家利益  阿根廷举行全国规模总罢工

    要求改善生活和保卫国家利益
    阿根廷举行全国规模总罢工
    新华社19日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在阿根廷总统弗朗迪西赴美访问前夕，全国规模的总罢工已经使阿根廷陷入瘫痪状态。阿根廷两大工会系统的六十二个工会和三十二个工会在17日和18日相继宣布举行总罢工，支持国营屠宰冷藏厂工人的罢工和反对政府的经济政策。工业和商业从业人员，包括邮电、食品、货运、电力、公务员、新闻记者和印刷工人都卷入了这次罢工。
    消息说，这次全国总罢工是由于政府对六千名国营屠宰冷藏厂工人举行的罢工采取镇压手段而爆发的。这个工厂的工人极力反对政府把这个工厂交给美国垄断资本去经营。在政府驱散和逮捕罢工的冷藏厂工人以前，工人们从15日开始便占领了国营屠宰冷藏厂的厂房，树立了写着“屠宰厂将仍然是阿根廷的”的标语牌，并且高呼“不答应给美国佬！”的口号。
    在政府对冷藏厂工人进行逮捕以后，六十二个工会立即在17日宣布举行无限期总罢工。六十二个工会发表的罢工声明说，政府的“稳定经济计划”将“降低工人阶级的生活水平和最后完成使国家沦为殖民地的进程”。声明指出，阿根廷工人“决不答应出卖国家的精神财富和物质财富”。接着，阿根廷三十二个工会也在18日宣布总罢工四十八小时声援屠宰冷藏厂的工人，同时表示坚决抗议政府的“建筑在穷人痛苦基础上的不可靠的稳定经济计划”。阿根廷其他工会的工人和职员也同时宣布举行罢工。
    据报道，阿根廷政府的“稳定经济计划”是由弗朗迪西总统在去年12月29日宣布的。它的中心内容是取消比索和美元的官方兑换比率，作为取得美国贷款的条件之一，同时取消进口的限制和限额的规定。阿根廷的一些报纸指出，上述措施将使美国进出口商获得更大的利润，并且为外国商品向阿根廷倾销大开方便之门。在弗朗迪西总统宣布“稳定经济计划”不久以后，阿根廷各种物价立即飞涨，阿根廷的劳动人民因而不得不再次掀起为要求改善生活和保卫国家利益的罢工斗争。
    据路透社18日报道，阿根廷正在采取强硬措施来对付罢工的工人。政府已经宣布所有罢工为非法。宣布罢工为非法的文告说，在工人停工的日子将不付给他们工资。政府还宣布将征集1937年出生的复员军重新入伍，并命令度假的新兵归回兵营。另有消息说，阿根廷警察局18日没收了阿根廷共产党机关报“时报”当天发行的报纸。
