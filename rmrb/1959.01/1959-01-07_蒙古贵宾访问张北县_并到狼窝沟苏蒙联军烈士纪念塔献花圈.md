Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 6th – Molomjamts, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Mongolian government delegation he led, visited Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, this morning, accompanied by Chang Yanqing, Director of the Complete Plant Equipment Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Zhang Shijie, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xie Feng, Secretary of the CPC Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee, and Han Zhifei, Deputy Commissioner of the Zhangjiakou Special District.

On the way to Zhangbei County, the delegation first laid a wreath at the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Martyrs Memorial Tower on Langwogou Mountain, which was covered in snow. In 1945, on the eve of the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the heroic Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces launched a destructive offensive against the Japanese invading forces occupying the Chabei area of our country in order to support the liberation cause of the Chinese people. The Japanese invading forces retreated to the Langwogou area, relying on the dangerous terrain and solid fortifications to resist stubbornly. The Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces destroyed the solid fortifications of the Japanese invading forces with a fierce offensive, annihilating more than 860 Japanese invading soldiers, enabling our army to quickly liberate Zhangjiakou and other places. In this battle, 60 Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces officers and soldiers gave their lives for the liberation cause of the Chinese people. This memorial tower was built by the Chinese people to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in this battle. After laying the wreath, the delegation stood in silent tribute in front of the memorial tower for a long time.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by responsible persons of Party and government organs and more than 5,600 commune members of the people's commune in Zhangbei County. Accompanied by Zhao Xiu, Deputy County Magistrate of Zhangbei County, the delegation visited the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, the Motor Manufacturing Factory, and the Hailiutu Reservoir and Hydropower Station of the Red Flag People's Commune. In the evening, the CPC Zhangbei County Committee and the Zhangbei County People's Committee held a banquet and soiree for the distinguished guests.

    蒙古贵宾访问张北县
    并到狼窝沟苏蒙联军烈士纪念塔献花圈
    新华社张家口6日电　蒙古人民共和国部长会议副主席莫洛姆扎木茨和他率领的蒙古政府代表团，今天上午在对外贸易部成套设备局局长常彦卿、外交部礼宾司副司长张世杰、中共张家口地委书记解峰、张家口专区副专员韩直飞等人的陪同下，乘车到河北省张北县访问。
    代表团在前往张北县途中，先到复盖着白雪的狼窝沟山上向苏蒙联军烈士纪念塔献了花圈。1945年日本帝国主义投降前夕，英雄的苏蒙联军为了支援中国人民的解放事业，向占领我察北地区的日本侵略军展开了歼灭性的进攻。日本侵略军溃退到狼窝沟一带，凭借险要地势和坚固工事进行顽抗。苏蒙联军以猛烈攻势摧毁了日本侵略军的坚固工事，歼灭日本侵略军八百六十多人，使我军迅速解放了张家口等地。在这次战斗中，有六十名苏蒙联军官兵为中国人民的解放事业献出了自己的生命，这个纪念塔是中国人民为纪念这次战斗中牺牲的烈士们建立的。代表团献花圈后，在纪念塔前长时间地肃立致敬。
    代表团在张北县受到了党和政府机关负责人以及人民公社社员五千六百多人的热烈欢迎。代表团在张北县副县长赵琇的陪同下，参观了第一机械厂、电机制造厂和红旗人民公社的海流图水库与水力发电站等。晚间，中共张北县委、张北县人民委员会为贵宾举行了宴会和晚会。
