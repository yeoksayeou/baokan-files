Launch the Masses to Vigorously Run Schools
Great Development of Education in Qinghai

(Our report) Along with the overall leap forward in socialist revolution and industrial, agricultural and pastoral production, the school education in Qinghai Province saw a vigorous development last year. The development of various types of schools at all levels across the province surpassed the total of the First Five-Year Plan. The 11 counties and cities in agricultural areas and 8 counties in pastoral areas have popularized primary school education. The number of primary schools in the province increased more than sevenfold compared to the year before; the number of secondary schools (including vocational schools and teacher training schools) increased more than threefold; the number of universities and colleges increased from two to seven, with the number of students increasing more than eighteenfold. Last year, the province had its first graduates from local universities. The development of spare-time education was even more rapid. The eleven counties and cities in the agricultural area and the pastoral area have established 728 various vocational (technical) secondary schools, with more than 30,000 participants; in addition, more than 260,000 people participated in spare-time higher primary school classes, secondary school classes, and various new types of schools (Red and Expert, Public Schools). In pastoral areas where educational development had been relatively slow in the past, a high tide of cultural revolution has also emerged. In the two Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures of Huangnan and Haibei, the enrollment rate of school-age children reached over 90%. The number of students in the first category of secondary schools in the entire pastoral area increased by eight and a half times compared to the previous year. In many remote areas where there were no schools in the past, the sound of reading aloud can now be heard.

The primary reason for the significant achievements in school education work last year was the strengthening of Party leadership and the breaking of superstitions. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Party committees of various prefectures and counties convened special meetings on cultural and educational work, formulated educational work plans for their respective regions, criticized the bourgeois educational line of relying on "experts" and "education for education's sake," as well as right-leaning conservative ideas such as "regularization," "theory of sole dependence on conditions," and "theory of backwardness," and ideas of "superstition" and "inferiority complex." The Party committees of all prefectures and counties designated a secretary to specifically manage cultural and educational work, strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership over cultural and educational work.

Secondly, it was due to the implementation of the mass line and the principle of diligence and frugality in running schools. The process of the great leap forward in education over the past year was also the process of mobilizing the masses for education. All parts of the province have successively organized the masses to conduct discussions and debates on the significant meaning of running education and learning culture, and criticized the erroneous thinking among cadres who did not believe in or rely on the masses. After that, they actively led and mobilized the masses, "those who are able are teachers", used whatever was available in a simple way, and used the available houses and took measures such as mobilizing the masses to bring their own tables and stools to solve the difficulties of teachers, school buildings, and equipment.

Thirdly, the resolute implementation of the principle of combining education with productive labor and the principle of "unified purpose, diverse forms" of schooling has also played an important role in promoting the development of education and improving the quality of education. In the elimination of illiteracy, all regions generally adopted the method of "where production goes, learning catches up," teaching on the canals and in the fields, achieving "pencils and fountain pens never leave the hand, books and blackboards follow along." The masses reflected: "These methods are good, production is rushed, illiteracy is eliminated during breaks, and neither is delayed."

    发动群众大办学校
    青海教育事业大发展
    本报讯　随着社会主义革命和工农牧业生产全面大跃进，青海省的学校教育事业去年出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。全省各级各类学校的发展超过了第一个五年计划的总和，农业区的十一个县市和牧业区的八个县已普及了小学教育。全省小学比前年增加了七倍多；中等学校（包括中专、师范）增加了三倍多；高等学校由前年的两所增加到七所，学生增加了十八倍以上，去年第一次有了本省高等学校的毕业生。业余教育的发展更加迅速，农业区十一县市及牧业区已办起各种职业（技术）中学七百二十八所，参加学习的有三万多人；另外还有二十六万多人参加了业余高小班、中学班和各类新型学校（红专、公学）的学习。以往教育事业发展比较迟缓的牧业区，也出现了文化革命的高潮。黄南、海北两个藏族自治州的学龄儿童入学率达到90％以上。全牧业区第一类中等学校的学生比前年增加了八倍半。许多过去没有学校的偏僻地方，现在都可以听到朗朗的读书声。
    去年学校教育工作取得显著成绩的首要原因是加强了党的领导，破除了迷信。中共青海省委和各州、县委都召开了文教工作专门会议，制定了本地区的教育工作规划，批判了依靠“专家”和“为教育而教育”的资产阶级教育路线，以及“正规化”“唯条件论”“落后论”等右倾保守思想和“迷信”“自卑”思想。各州、县党委都指定一名书记专管文教工作，加强了党对文教工作的政治思想领导和组织领导。
    其次是由于贯彻执行了群众路线和勤俭办学的方针。一年来教育工作大跃进的过程，也是发动教育群众的过程。全省各地都曾先后组织群众对办教育和学习文化的重大意义进行了鸣放和辩论，并批判了干部中不相信群众、不依靠群众的错误思想。而后，积极领导和发动群众，以“能者为师”，因陋就简，利用了可能利用的房屋和采取发动群众自带桌凳等办法，解决了师资、校舍、设备等困难。
    第三，坚决贯彻了教育与生产劳动结合以及“目的统一，形式多样”的办学原则，对于促进教育事业的发展和提高教育质量也起了重要作用。各地在扫盲中，一般都采取了“生产到哪里，学习赶上去”的办法，在水渠上和田间进行教学，做到了“铅笔、水笔不离手，书本，黑板跟上走”。群众反映说：“这些办法好，生产突击搞，休息把盲扫，两面误不了”。
