    Utterly selfless devotion to others
    Nineteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," proposed that every Communist Party member should learn the spirit of utter selflessness and devotion to others. Today, the deeds of Comrade Xiang Xiuli, published in this newspaper, are an example of this "utter selflessness and devotion to others."
    In the old society, there was a saying, "If a man does not act for himself, Heaven and Earth will destroy him." Although this saying is simple, it was indeed the way many people in the old society conducted themselves. However, for a Communist Party member, for a revolutionary who loves the people, it is a completely different matter. They never want to build their own happiness on the suffering of others, but rather use their own efforts, even their lives, to exchange for the happiness of others and protect the revolutionary cause and its achievements. In the past, on the battlefield, there were Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang; in the enemy's execution grounds, there were Liu Hulan and Ding Youjun; now, in the dangerous accidents in factories, there is also Xiang Xiuli. These comrades are the kind of people who are "utterly selfless and devoted to others," and they sacrificed themselves to save the lives of many people.
    People like this, who sacrifice themselves for others, can only grow up under the education of the Communist Party. Comrade Xiang Xiuli has gloriously sacrificed herself. We must learn from her noble spirit of loving the people and bravely advance along the road pointed out by the Party.

### 毫不利己专门利人

    毫不利己专门利人
    十九年前，毛泽东同志在“纪念白求恩”的文章中，曾经提出，每个共产党员都要学习毫不利己专门利人的精神。今天，本报发表的向秀丽同志的事迹，就是这种“毫不利己专门利人”的一个榜样。
    在旧社会，有一句话，叫做“人不为己，天诛地灭”。这句话虽然简单，却确是旧社会许多人立身处世之道。但是，在一个共产党员说来，在一个热爱人民的革命者说来，却完全是另外一回事业了。他们从来不愿意将自己的幸福建立在别人痛苦的基础上，而是以自己的努力以至生命来换取别人的幸福，保护革命事业及其成果。过去，在战场上，曾出现过董存瑞、黄继光，在敌人的刑场上，曾出现过刘胡兰、丁佑君，现在，在工厂的危急事故中，又出现了一个向秀丽。这些同志都是那种“毫不利己专门利人”的人，他们以自己的牺牲，保全了许多人的生命。
    像这样舍己为人的人，只有在共产党的教养下才会成长起来。向秀丽同志光荣牺牲了，我们一定要学习她热爱人民的崇高精神，沿着党所指引的道路奋勇前进。
