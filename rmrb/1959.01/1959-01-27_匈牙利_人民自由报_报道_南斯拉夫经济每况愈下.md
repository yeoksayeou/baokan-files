Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 25th: The "People's Freedom" published an article on the 24th reporting on the Yugoslav economic situation.

The article's author, Gyula István, wrote: In Yugoslavia, real wages cannot keep up with the constant rise in prices, and sometimes even nominal wages are reduced. According to materials published in the ninth issue of the Yugoslav statistical publication ("Index") in 1958, real wages in the first half of 1958 were 5.5% lower than in 1957.

The article pointed out that, according to official Yugoslav materials, the level of personal consumption of residents is declining year by year. It decreased by 5.1% in 1956 compared to 1948.

In the past two years, due to the reduction in real wages, the consumption level of residents has further decreased.

The article said that one of the reasons for the decline in the consumption level of Yugoslav residents is that agricultural production is very backward. According to figures published in the first week of October 1958 in the Yugoslav magazine "Economic Policy," agricultural production in 1958 was 25% lower than in 1957, and even lower than the pre-war level. The most important agricultural products have to rely on imports. In addition, according to official Yugoslav materials, investment in industrial sectors producing consumer goods is also decreasing year by year. Investment in this area was 514.5 billion dinars in 1957, decreased to 381.2 billion dinars in 1958, and will continue to decrease in 1959.

The article said that unemployed workers in Yugoslavia account for 7% of the total number of workers, and this percentage is increasing year by year. The Yugoslav authorities call the unemployed "people looking for work." According to statistics, the monthly average of such people was 67,233 in 1955, reached 99,333 in 1956, 115,904 in 1957, and reached 129,939 in the first eight months of 1958.

The article continued, the Yugoslav officials and economists say that this kind of unemployment is healthy and has an important economic effect, such as consolidating "labor discipline" and maintaining an appropriate wage level. The author pointed out that this statement is completely consistent with the views of officials and economists in capitalist countries.

    南斯拉夫经济每况愈下
    新华社布达佩斯25日电 “人民自由报”在24日登载了一篇报道南斯拉夫经济情况的文章。
    文章作者久拉·伊斯特万写道：在南斯拉夫，实际工资跟不上物价的经常上涨，有时甚至名义工资也降低了。根据南斯拉夫的统计刊物（“指数”）1958年第九期公布的材料，1958年上半年的实际工资比1957年低5.5％。
    文章指出，根据南斯拉夫官方材料，居民个人消费水平在逐年下降。1956年比1948年降低了5.1％。
    最近两年来，由于实际工资的减少，居民的消费水平又进一步降低了。
    文章说，南斯拉夫居民消费水平降低的原因之一是：农业生产非常落后。根据南斯拉夫“经济政策”杂志1958年10月第一周公布的数字，1958年的农业生产比1957年低25％，比战前的水平还低。最主要的农产品都要依靠进口。此外，据南斯拉夫官方材料，生产消费品的工业部门的投资也在逐年减少。1957年在这方面的投资是五千一百四十五亿第纳尔，1958年降为三千八百一十二亿第纳尔，1959年又继续减少。
    文章说，在南斯拉夫失业工人占工人总数的7％，并且是逐年在增加。南斯拉夫官方把失业者叫做“寻找工作的人”。据统计，这种人在1955年每月平均是六万七千二百三十三人，1956年即达九万九千三百三十三人，1957年是十一万五千九百零四人，1958年头八个月已达到十二万九千九百三十九人。
    文章接着说，南斯拉夫官方和经济学家们说，这种失业现象是健康的，并且具有重要的经济作用，如巩固“劳动纪律”和保持适当的工资水平等。作者指出，这种说法是同资本主义国家的官方人士和经济学家们的见解完全一致的。
