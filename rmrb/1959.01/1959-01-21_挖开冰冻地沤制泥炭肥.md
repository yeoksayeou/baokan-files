    Digging Frozen Ground to Compost Peat Fertilizer
    The youth of the Zhongshan Agricultural Team of the Longcheng Commune in Qin'an County, Gansu, have recently been actively involved in the manure accumulation campaign under the leadership of the Communist Youth League Committee.
    The team's more than 260 young people organized a Red Flag Manure Accumulation Company and camped at Bojiping and Shengua, where peat is produced. They dug open the frozen ground, extracted the peat, and then added 30% livestock manure or chicken manure, plus 1% to 3% lime to the peat. In this way, it can be fermented in three days, and the fertilizer effect is very good. After the hard work of the entire company of young people, more than 10 million jin of peat fertilizer were produced in three days.

    挖开冰冻地沤制泥炭肥
    甘肃秦安县陇城公社中山农耕大队的青年，最近在团委的领导下，积极投入积肥运动。
    全队二百六十多个青年，组织了红旗积肥连，在出泥炭的簸箕坪、深挂等地扎营。他们挖开封冻的地层，取出泥炭，然后，在泥炭中加上30％的牲畜粪或鸡粪，再加上1％到3％的石灰。这样，三天就可以地酵，肥效很好。经过全连青年的奋战，三天就造了泥炭肥一千多万斤。
