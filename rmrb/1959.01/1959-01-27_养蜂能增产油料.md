    Beekeeping Can Increase Oilseed Production
    In 1958, the national average yield of rapeseed was 73 jin per mu. There were several counties with large-scale bumper yields of over 200 jin per mu, including: Xinghua and Nanhui in Jiangsu, and Zhong County in Sichuan. Those with yields of over 150 jin per mu included Nanzheng in Shaanxi, Cixi in Zhejiang, and Songzi in Hubei. These counties also happen to be key beekeeping counties nationwide, which strongly proves that honeybee pollination helps increase rapeseed production.
    For example, in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, the county planted 20,000 mu of rapeseed and had about 1,000 hives of bees, averaging one hive per 20 mu. The average yield was 256 jin of rapeseed per mu, 3.5 times more than the national average yield, clearly indicating that beekeeping is an important factor in increasing production.
    According to the experience of this county, setting up a bee farm every two li in large-scale rapeseed fields and allocating bee colonies at a rate of one hive per five mu can increase rapeseed production by 20%-30%. Duotian People's Commune in the county equipped 40 hives of bees in 100 mu of rapeseed fields, averaging one hive per 2.5 mu, and the average yield was 326 jin of rapeseed per mu, 70 jin more than the county average. Yaoqiao Brigade (formerly Yaoqiao No. 2 Cooperative) of Zhoupu Commune in Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, placed 20 hives of bees near 175 mu of rapeseed fields, about one hive per nine mu, and the average yield was 305 jin per mu, 47 jin more than the county average of 253 jin per mu.
    Mr. Gong Yifei of Fujian Agricultural College conducted experiments showing that rapeseed pollinated by bees yielded 55%-67% more than rapeseed not pollinated by bees. Soviet and Bulgarian experimental records also showed yield increases of 60%-70%.
    Equipping rapeseed fields with bee colonies for pollination can not only increase rapeseed production, but also improve the oil yield of rapeseed due to full pollination and plump seeds. At the same time, each mu of rapeseed can also produce five to six jin of honey. This is a good measure that benefits both agriculture and beekeeping.
    Honeybee pollination can not only help increase rapeseed production, but also play a significant role in increasing the production of other oil crops such as sesame, sunflower, oil tea, and tallow tree.
    We must strive to "pass the test" for oilseeds, and this effective measure with immediate results should be actively promoted. According to recent statistics, there are currently about three million bee colonies in the country. If we intensify breeding and utilize them rationally, the increased rapeseed and honey production will be no small matter on a national scale. ·Li Jun· (with photo)

### 养蜂能增产油料

    养蜂能增产油料
    1958年全国的油菜平均每亩产菜籽七十三斤。亩产二百斤以上的大面积丰产县，计有：江苏的兴化、南汇，四川的忠县。亩产一百五十斤以上的有陕西的南郑，浙江的慈溪和湖北的松滋等县。这几个县，在全国来说，也恰恰是养蜂重点县，这就有力地证明了蜜蜂采花授粉，帮助油菜增产。
    例如江苏省兴化县，全县种二万亩油菜，约有一千箱蜜蜂，合二十亩一箱蜂。平均每亩收菜籽二百五十六斤，比全国平均产量增加三点五倍，显然养蜂是增产的一个重要因素。
    根据这个县的经验，在大面积油菜田里，每隔二里地设一个蜂场，按五亩地一箱蜂配置蜂群，菜籽能增产20％—30％。该县垛田人民公社，在一百亩油菜田里配备四十箱蜜蜂，合二点五亩一箱蜂，平均每亩收菜籽三百二十六斤，比全县平均产量增加七十斤。江苏省南汇县周浦公社姚乔大队（原姚乔二社），在一百七十五亩油菜田附近放置二十箱蜂，约合九亩地一箱蜂，平均亩产三百零五斤，比全县平均亩产二百五十三斤多收四十七斤。
    福建农学院龚一飞先生作过试验，有蜜蜂授粉的油菜比没有蜜蜂授粉的增产55％—67％。在苏联和保加利亚的试验记录里，也曾有增产60％—70％的记录。
    在油菜田里配备蜂群授粉，不但能使菜籽增产，由于充分授粉，菜籽饱实，还能提高菜籽的出油率。同时每亩油菜还能生产五到六斤蜂蜜。这是农业蜂业两有利的一种好措施。
    蜜蜂授粉不仅能帮助油菜增产，对于别的油料作物如芝麻、向日葵、油茶、乌桕等都能起显著的增产作用。
    我们要力争油料“过关”，这种立竿见影的有效措施应该积极加以提倡。据最近统计，全国现有蜜蜂共约三百万群。如果加紧繁殖并且合理的利用起来，能增产的菜籽和蜂蜜，在全国范围来说，决不是一件小事情。·李俊·（附图片）
