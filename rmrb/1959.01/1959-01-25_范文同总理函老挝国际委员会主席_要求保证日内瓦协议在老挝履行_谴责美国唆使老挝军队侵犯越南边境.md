Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 23rd: The letter from Pham Van Dong, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, written on January 19th to Lieutenant General Singh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission in Laos, regarding the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Laos, was released here today. The full text is as follows:

“Your Excellency:

I would like to draw your attention to the recent serious situation in Laos, which is detrimental to the peace of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

For four years, the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, chaired by the Indian representative, has made positive contributions to maintaining peace and achieving unification in Laos. These achievements are important, but after achieving the above preliminary results, the main task is to ensure the correct and full implementation of the political and military clauses of the Geneva Agreement in Laos, and to ensure that the specific agreements signed between the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces are respected. On the other hand, the issue of implementing the Geneva Agreement is closely related to the three countries of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. While the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Vietnam has encountered many difficulties due to obstruction by US imperialism and pro-American reactionaries, it cannot be considered that the task of implementing this agreement has been completed in Laos.

Recently, US imperialism has intensified its interference and activities in Laos, especially in the military field. They have brought middle and senior military personnel into Laos under the guise of various delegations, and these people serve as advisors to the Lao army or are responsible for managing police organizations. The US military aid agencies have also brought new weapons into Laos under various pretexts, illegally expanded arms depots, supplied food and weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek remnants who are harassing the border between Myanmar and Laos, expanded and added new military bases, and repaired existing airfields (such as the Sam Neua airport, the Phongsaly Polo airport, the Ba Dinh airport, and the Tran Ninh Plateau airport, etc., so that large aircraft can use them), and built many new airports. They have also widened some strategic highways and connected them to the strategic highways of South Vietnam, such as the highway from Attopeu in Laos to Kontum and Qui Nhon in South Vietnam, Highway 9, and Highway 13, etc. In addition, delegations led by some senior US military officers have visited Laos and held talks with responsible persons of the Lao Royal Government to discuss military issues related to Laos. For example, US Navy Lieutenant General Riley and US Deputy Secretary of Defense Caris visited Vientiane on July 3, 1958, and November 19, 1958, respectively. In order to realize the conspiracy of US imperialism in Indochina, the South Vietnamese authorities, with the support of the Lao Royal Government, have sent many military personnel disguised as civilians into Laos, using Laos as a base to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Since the Pathet Lao fighting forces were merged into the Lao Kingdom, the Lao Royal Government has seriously violated Article 15 of the Geneva Agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos, and has intensified suppression, retaliation, and discrimination against Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, i.e., former resistance personnel.

Under the instigation, support, and cooperation of US imperialism and foreign countries, the Lao Kingdom has increased its troops to the Vietnamese-Lao border, continuously violated the airspace and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and created a turbulent situation in the border areas between the two countries. Although the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly protested and suggested resolving disputes through peaceful consultation, similar incidents have occurred repeatedly, and have recently created a tense situation in the Xiang Lap area.

In terms of territorial sovereignty, Xiang Lap Commune has been part of Vietnamese territory since ancient times, and the regime of this commune still belongs to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is an objective fact that no one can deny. Since the beginning of December 1958, the Lao Kingdom has increased its troops around Xiang Lap Commune, built more bunkers, and at the same time sent troops to invade the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, carrying out activities such as reconnaissance, propaganda, and writing provocative letters. The purpose of these activities is to create tension on the Vietnamese-Lao border and to use this artificial tension as an excuse to establish a dictatorial system as a tool to undermine the Geneva Agreement and pave the way for Laos to join the Southeast Asia Military Group. It is clear that the "Xiang Lap issue" is a conspiracy created by US imperialism and its running dogs in Laos. The above-mentioned acts seriously violate Articles 6, 7, 9, and 15 of the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities, as well as paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference.

In the face of the above-mentioned serious violations of the Geneva Agreement and the disturbing development of the current situation, in order to guarantee the peace of Laos, Vietnam, and the entire Indochina, the existence of the International Commission in Laos and the continued performance of its task of supervising and inspecting the implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Laos have become even more necessary.

For the peaceful interests of the Vietnamese and Lao people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as one of the signatories to the Geneva Agreement, has the responsibility to promote the strict implementation of the various clauses of the Geneva Agreement. Therefore, I would like to draw your attention to the recent situation in Laos and hope that the International Commission in Laos will continue its activities in order to investigate the violations of the Geneva Agreement that have occurred in Laos, and take appropriate and resolute measures to ensure that the Geneva Agreement is respected and strictly implemented.

Mr. Chairman, please accept my highest respects."

### 范文同总理函老挝国际委员会主席  要求保证日内瓦协议在老挝履行  谴责美国唆使老挝军队侵犯越南边境

    范文同总理函老挝国际委员会主席
    要求保证日内瓦协议在老挝履行
    谴责美国唆使老挝军队侵犯越南边境
    新华社河内23日电　这里今天公布了越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同在1月19日就日内瓦协议在老挝履行的问题写给老挝国际委员会主席辛格·巴尔中将的一封信。全文如下：
    “阁下：
    我谨请你注意最近在老挝发生的严重情况，这种情况不利于老挝和越南民主共和国的和平。
    四年来，以印度代表为主席的老挝国际监督和监察委员会对维护老挝和平、实现老挝的统一作出了积极的贡献。这种成绩是重要的，但是在取得上述初步成绩之后，主要工作是必须保证在老挝正确和充分地履行日内瓦协议的政治和军事条款以及使老挝王国和前寮国战斗部队之间签订的各项具体协议能够得到尊重。另一方面，履行日内瓦协议的问题同越南、老挝和柬埔寨三个国家都有密切的关系。在美帝国主义和亲美反动派进行阻挠以致日内瓦协议在越南履行时遇到许多困难的情况下，就不能认为已经在老挝完成了履行这个协议的任务。
    最近，美帝国主义加强了它对老挝的干涉和活动，尤其是军事方面的活动。它们以各种代表团的名义，把中、高级军事人员输入老挝，并且使这些人担任老挝军队的顾问或者负责管理警察组织。美国军事援助机构还以各种口实把新式武器输入老挝，非法地扩大军火仓库，以粮食和武器接济正在缅甸、老挝边境骚扰的蒋介石残匪，扩大和增添新的军事基地，修复原有的飞机场（如桑怒机场、丰沙里的保罗机场、百佃机场和镇宁平原机场等，使大型飞机能够使用），并且新建许多飞机场。它们还加宽一些战略公路，并且把它们同南越的战略公路连接起来，例如从老挝的阿速坡到南越的昆嵩和归仁的公路、第九号公路和第十三号公路等。此外，还有一些美国高级军官率领的代表团曾经访问了老挝，同老挝王国政府的负责人士举行会谈，讨论有关老挝的军事问题，例如美国海军中将赖利和美国国防部副部长卡利斯先后在1958年7月3日和1958年11月19日来到万象。为了实现美帝国主义在印度支那的阴谋，南越当局在老挝王国政府支持下，把许多伪装为平民的军事人员派进老挝，以老挝为基地向越南民主共和国进行间谍活动和破坏活动。
    自从寮国战斗部队合并到老挝王国以来，老挝王国政府严重地违反日内瓦会议关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第十五条，对寮国战斗部队人员即前抗战人员加强了镇压、报复和歧视行动。
    在美帝国主义和外国的唆使、扶持和配合下，老挝王国增派军队到越南、老挝边境，连续侵犯越南民主共和国领空和领土，在两国边界地区制造动荡局势，虽然越南民主共和国政府多次提出抗议，并且建议通过和平协商的办法来解决争端，但是类似的事件仍然一再发生，最近已经在向立地区造成紧张局势。
    就领土主权来说，向立乡自古以来就是越南领土上的一部分，现在这个乡的政权仍然属于越南民主共和国。这是任何人无法辩驳的客观事实。从1958年12月初以来，老挝王国在向立乡周围增派军队，增筑碉堡，同时派军队侵入越南民主共和国领土，进行刺探、宣传和写挑衅性的信件等活动。这些活动的目的是想在越南、老挝边界制造紧张局势，并且以这种人为的紧张局势为借口来建立一种独裁制度，作为破坏日内瓦协议和为老挝加入东南亚军事集团开路的工具。很显然，“向立问题”是美帝国主义和它在老挝的走卒所制造的阴谋。上述行为，严重违反老挝停止敌对行动协定第六、第七、第九和第十五条，以及日内瓦会议最后宣言的第四和第五段。
    面对着上述严重违反日内瓦协议的事件和目前局势的令人不安的发展，为了保障老挝、越南和整个印度支那的和平，老挝国际委员会的存在和继续执行它监督、监察日内瓦协议在老挝的履行的任务，就显得更加必要。
    为了越南人民和老挝人民的和平利益，作为日内瓦协议签字国之一的越南民主共和国政府，负有促使日内瓦协议各项条款得到严格履行的责任。因此，谨提请您注意老挝最近的局势，并且希望老挝国际委员会继续活动，以便调查在老挝发生的违反日内瓦协议的情况，采取适当和坚决的措施来保证日内瓦协议得到尊重和严格履行。
    主席先生，请接受我最崇高的敬意。”
