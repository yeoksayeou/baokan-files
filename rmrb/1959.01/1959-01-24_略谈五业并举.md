A Brief Discussion on Simultaneous Development of Five Sectors
Sun Yuan

While ensuring vigorous development of grain production, vigorously developing diverse economies to achieve comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is an important policy on the agricultural front. The experience of the past few years, especially last year, tells us that agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries must support and promote each other.

Jiangxi Province's Jing'an County's "blooming of five flowers" (agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries) in the Great Leap Forward last year is a noteworthy example. In 1958, the income from forestry and sideline occupations in this mountainous county, calculated per capita, amounted to 26 yuan per commune member. Each commune had sufficient production funds, and commune members also had pocket money. It is particularly worth noting that this development of diverse economies coincided with the leap forward in agriculture. The county's total grain output in 1958 doubled compared to 1957, and the unit area yield exceeded the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program, reaching 816 jin per mu.

Hunan Province's Qianyang Special District is another example. Due to the implementation of the policy of "grain as the main focus, with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries" over the past year, the output of grain, pigs, fish, tangerines, sugarcane, bamboo, tea oil, tung oil, and the collection of wild plants have all increased significantly. The significant development of diverse economies has greatly promoted industrial and agricultural production and construction. The district has established over 5,600 local specialty processing plants this year, with raw materials obtained from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

Some people believe that in a situation of extreme labor shortage, it is almost impossible to take care of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries while developing agriculture. In fact, if the leadership pays attention early, makes comprehensive arrangements according to the specific circumstances of the time and place, distinguishing between the importance and urgency of each sector, then, while continuously accelerating the development of agriculture, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries can be developed simultaneously. The experience of Qianyang Special District and Jing'an County refutes the one-sided view that "agricultural production tasks are heavy, and diverse economies cannot be fully developed."

The reason why some people neglect the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries is often because they only look at the present, not the future; only at their own society, not the state; in short, they only see one side and not the other. Therefore, in their work, they exhibit the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. The Jing'an County Party Committee, however, understands the importance of overall planning and taking all factors into consideration. As early as last spring, based on the principle of comprehensive development of agriculture and diverse economies, they repeatedly calculated three major accounts with township and commune cadres: income and expenditure accounts, support for national construction and satisfaction of social needs accounts, and labor accounts, so that everyone clearly understood the importance of comprehensive development of diverse economies. In this way, everyone established the view of comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries at the beginning of the leap forward, and therefore achieved comprehensive victory on the agricultural production front.

The facts of Qianyang Special District and Jing'an County once again prove the correctness of the Party's policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production. This policy points out a broad road for the comprehensive, rapid, good, and economical development of the commune economy in our country. To correctly implement and carry out this policy, we must conscientiously study and deeply understand the Party's policies, learn to correctly and comprehensively observe problems, and pay attention to studying the internal and external connections of things. The relationship between agricultural production and diverse economies in economic work is like the relationship between industry and agriculture, and the same is true for other work. As a leader, he should always pay attention to the trends of production, calmly analyze the relationships between various tasks, make overall plans and take all factors into consideration. Only in this way can our work become more and more detailed, and can all aspects of our undertakings be developed in a comprehensive way.

    略谈五业并举
    孙渊
    在保证大力发展粮食生产的同时，大力发展多种经济，使农、林、牧、副、渔五业全面迅速发展，这是农业战线上的重要方针。过去几年特别是去年的经验告诉我们：农业与林、牧、副、渔必须互相支持、互相助长。
    江西省靖安县去年大跃进中农、林、牧、副、渔“五花齐开并茂”，就是个值得重视的例子。这个山区县1958年林副业的收入，按人口计算，每个社员可分二十六元。每个公社都有较充足的生产资金，社员也有了零用钱。特别值得注意的是：这种多种经济的发展是同农业的跃进同时出现的。全县1958年粮食总产量比1957年增加一倍，单位面积产量跨过了全国农业发展纲要所规定的指标，亩产量达到了八百十六斤。
    湖南省黔阳专区是另一个例子，这个专区一年来由于贯彻执行了“以粮食为主，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展”的方针，粮食、生猪、鱼、柑桔、甘蔗、竹木、油茶、油桐等产量以及野生植物采集量，都有很大的增长。多种经济的大发展，对于工农业生产建设，起了巨大的促进作用，全区今年新办起的土特产品加工厂就有五千六百多座，原料就是从林牧副渔各业中取得的。
    有些人认为，在劳动力十分紧张的情况下，要在发展农业的同时，兼顾林、牧、副、渔，几乎是不可能的。其实，要是领导上及早注意，根据当时当地的具体情况，分别轻重缓急，全面安排，那末，在不断地加速发展农业的条件下，农业与林、牧、副、渔各业是能够同时并举的。黔阳专区和靖安县的经验驳倒了那种认为“农业生产任务重、多种经济不能全面发展”的片面观点。
    有些人所以忽视农林牧副渔全面发展的问题，往往因为他们只看眼前，不看将来；只看本社，不看国家；总之，只看到了这一面，没有看到那一面。所以在工作中就出现了顾此失彼的现象。靖安县委却懂得统筹兼顾，早在去年春季就本着农业和多种经济全面发展的原则，同乡、社干部反复算过三笔大账：收入支出账、支援国家建设和满足社会需要账、劳力账，使得大家明确了多种经济全面发展的重要意义。这样，大家在跃进一开始就树立了农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进的观点，因而获得了农业生产战线上的全面胜利。
    黔阳专区和靖安县的事实，再一次证明党的工农业同时并举的方针，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针的正确性，这个方针为我国全面发展公社经济指出了一条多快好省的康庄大道。要正确地执行和贯彻这个方针，就得认真地学习和深刻地领会党的方针，学会正确地全面观察问题，注意研究事物的内在联系和外部联系。经济工作中农业生产与多种经济的关系如此，工业和农业的关系如此，其他的工作也是一样。作为领导者，他应该时刻都要注意生产的动向，冷静地分析各种工作之间的关系，统筹兼顾，全面安排。这样才能使我们的工作愈做愈细致，才能使各个方面的事业全面发展。
