    After Standing in Line Leads to Being Eliminated
    Wu Lü
    Arranging basic construction projects requires standing in line. Since there is standing in line, there must be those who are ahead and those who are behind. It is naturally best to have stood in line and be on the list. However, what should be done if standing in line leads to being eliminated?
    Projects eliminated while standing in line are usually in one of two situations. One is considered from the perspective of whether it is urgently needed: although the project is important, it is not immediately indispensable from the perspective of need, and therefore it is eliminated. The other is considered from the perspective of whether it is possible: although the project itself is very needed, it cannot be put on the agenda all at once due to limitations of conditions, and therefore it is eliminated. These two different situations are prerequisites for carefully distinguishing what to do after being eliminated from standing in line. Confusing these two different situations will inevitably lead to incorrect conclusions.
    For the first situation, that is, being eliminated because it is not urgently needed, the correct attitude should probably be to obey the decision of standing in line and revoke the original plan. This is because it is a question of whether to follow the objective law of proportionate development of various sectors of the national economy. Some comrades often attribute the reason for standing in line to insufficient materials and manpower; but they do not know that the reason for standing in line is primarily because our economy is a socialist economy, and the socialist economy must develop proportionately. In standing in line, eliminating projects that are not yet urgently needed for the development of the national economy is nothing more than making the development of the economy conform to the objective law of proportionate development. Therefore, here, what determines fate is not the question of possibility or impossibility, but the question of need or lack thereof.
    For the second situation, that is, being eliminated because of material and manpower arrangements despite being needed, the correct attitude is also to obey the decision of standing in line, but self-reliance should still be advocated. Because these projects were originally needed for the development of the national economy, but they were eliminated due to temporary limitations of materials and manpower. Here, what determines fate is not the question of need or lack thereof, but the question of possibility or impossibility. From the perspective of balancing the materials and manpower possessed by the state, they are temporarily eliminated; however, if these units can be self-reliant, not ask the state for materials or people, and do it themselves, it can only benefit the development of production and do no harm. Therefore, this kind of enthusiasm for self-reliance should be greatly promoted. If you ask: is this possible? We say: it may not be possible to use self-reliance to start up all the projects eliminated due to insufficient materials and manpower; but it is entirely possible to start up some projects using self-reliance. The news about the Xi'an Cable Factory and Xi'an Transformer Factory published in this newspaper today are two examples.
    If a project is neither needed nor possible, but it is eliminated and one is still unwilling to give up and wants to do it, this kind of enthusiasm can only be described as blind enthusiasm. Comrades in these units should use their enthusiasm in aspects needed by the national economy. If a project is needed but cannot be put on the schedule for the time being, and one becomes disheartened after being eliminated and does not want to find other ways to do it, it is a kind of negative emotion. Having this situation will prevent us from finding other ways out. Comrades in these units should give play to their enthusiasm and think of ways to be self-reliant.

    排队排掉之后
    吴滤
    安排基本建设的项目要排队。既然要排队，有所前，必有所后。排队排上了，榜上有名，自然是最好不过的了。然而，若是排队排掉了，又应该如何呢？
    在排队中给排掉了的项目，通常不外两种情况。一种是从是不是迫切需要来考虑的：这个项目虽然重要，但从需要上来看，还不是马上非建设不可，因而给排掉了；另一种是从是不是可能来考虑的：项目本身虽然很需要，但由于条件的限制，一时不可能都摆到日程上来，因而给排掉了。这两种不同的情况，是考虑排队排掉之后怎么办必须严加区分的前提。把这两种不同的情况混淆起来，必难得出正确的结论。
    对于第一种情况，即因为不是迫切需要而给排掉的，正确的态度，恐怕应该是服从排队的决定，撤销原来的计划。因为这是一个关系到是不是要遵循国民经济各部门按比例发展的客观法则问题。有些同志常常把所以要排队的原因，一概归结为物力和人力不足；而不知道所以要排队，首先还因为我们的经济是社会主义经济，社会主义经济必须按比例发展。在排队中，把国民经济发展一时还不十分需要的项目排掉，无非是使经济的发展符合按比例发展的客观法则。因此，在这里，决定命运的，不是可能不可能的问题，而是需要不需要的问题。
    对于第二种情况，即虽然需要，但由于物力、人力安排不过来而给排掉的，正确的态度，也是应该服从排队的决定，但还提倡自力更生。因为这些项目本来是国民经济发展所需要的，只不过由于一时物力、人力的限制给排下来了。这里，决定命运的，不是需要不需要的问题，而是可能不可能的问题。从国家拥有的物力、人力来平衡，它们暂时给排掉了；但是，如果这些单位能自力更生，不向国家要材料、要人，自己动手干起来，对于发展生产只有好处，没有坏处。因此，这种自力更生的积极性，应该大大地提倡。若问：这可能吗？我们说：全部因物力、人力不足被排掉的项目，都用自力更生的办法干起来，也许是不可能的；但部分项目用自力更生的办法干起来，却是完全可能的。今天本报发表的西安电缆厂和西安变压器厂的新闻，就是两个例子。
    既不需要又不可能的项目，给排掉了，不死心，还要搞，这种积极性只能说是盲目的积极性。这些单位的同志应该把自己的积极性用到国民经济所需要的方面去。需要但一时还不可能排上的项目，给排掉了，就灰了心，不想别的办法搞，是一种消极情绪。有了这种情况，就妨碍我们寻找别的出路。这些单位的同志应该发挥积极性，想些办法自力更生。
