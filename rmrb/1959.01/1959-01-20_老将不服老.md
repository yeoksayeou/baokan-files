    Old General Refuses to Accept Old Age
    After General Xu Shiyou enlisted in the Sixth Company, on the twelfth day, the company conducted live ammunition shooting in the mountains. The three targets for the shooting were all set on the hillside. The high and low angles and air pressure in mountain shooting have a great impact on aiming and projectile flight, which is more complex than horizontal shooting. After the shooting started, General Xu Shiyou lay down to shoot at the first target. This target, set at a distance of two hundred meters, was only the size of a bunker's firing port. The sunlight at the time was very strong, making the eyes sore. However, the General hit the target with his first shot.
    Afterwards, the General carried the uncorrected gun up the mountain to shoot at the second target. This time, he fired several shots at the two targets within the specified minute, but none hit. He continued up the mountain, and at the top of the mountain, he shot at the third target (three No. 8 A targets at a distance of three hundred meters) down the mountain. He fired three shots in a row within twenty seconds (the limit was forty-five seconds), and all three targets were hit.
    Given General Xu Shiyou's age and not very good eyesight, he should have been very satisfied with such shooting results. However, General Xu Shiyou was very dissatisfied because he did not hit the second target. He kept thinking about one question: Is it because of old age and eye problems, or is there something wrong with the gun?
    The next day, General Xiao Wangdong, who was also serving in the Sixth Company, said to the General, "It is a fact that we are old, don't try to compete with young people." General Xu Shiyou said, "I just don't accept old age!"
    That day, with the permission of the company commander, the General used a corrected rifle to shoot at the second target again, and as a result, both targets were hit.

    老将不服老
    许世友上将等到第六连当兵后的第十二天，连里就进行山地实弹射击。射击的三个目标都设在山坡上。山地射击中的高低角、气压，对瞄准和弹丸飞行有很大影响，比水平射击更为复杂。射击开始后，许世友上将卧倒对第一号目标进行射击。这个设置在二百公尺远的目标，面积只有地堡的射击口那么大。当时的阳光很强，照得眼睛发酸。可是上将第一枪就命中了目标。
    随后，上将提着没有矫正过的枪上了山，对第二号目标进行射击，这次，在规定的一分钟内对两个靶子连射几发子弹，都没有命中。他又继续上山，到了山顶，对山下第三号目标（三百公尺距离，三个八号甲靶）进行射击。在二十秒钟内（限定四十五秒）连发三枪，三个靶子全部命中。
    按照许世友上将那样的年纪，眼睛又不大好，取得这样的射击成绩，应该非常满意了。但是，许世友上将因为没有打中第二号目标，很不满足。他反复考虑着一个问题：到底是年老眼睛有毛病，还是枪的毛病呢？
    第二天，同在六连当兵的萧望东将军对上将说：“我们的年纪大是个事实，不要硬和青年人比。”许世友上将说：“我就是不服老！”
    这天，得到连首长的准许，上将用矫正过的步枪对第二号目标再次进行射击，结果两个靶子都打中了。
