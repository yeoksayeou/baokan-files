According to the Hebei Daily, Zunhua County, Hebei, boosted the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer by combining political command with appropriate rewards, with both collective and individual fertilizer accumulation being carried out simultaneously.

The Zunhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China planned to apply 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu this year, requiring a total of 50 billion jin of fertilizer for the entire county. According to the inspection on December 15th of last year, only 857 million jin of rough fertilizer had been accumulated, leaving a shortage of over 49 billion jin. The slow progress in fertilizer accumulation was mainly due to ideological problems. Some people believed that the mud in the pits was exhausted, and there was not much manure, so there was no source of fertilizer. Others believed that accumulating fertilizer for the commune did not provide any compensation, so their enthusiasm was not high. After analysis, the County Committee believed that: on the one hand, it was due to a lack of political education work, and some people still held conservative ideas; on the other hand, after the communization, the fertilizer accumulation system was not adjusted in time, especially the lack of appropriate reward system, which affected the enthusiasm of the commune members to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, the County Committee first focused on political work in fertilizer accumulation, and assigned a County Committee Secretary to specifically oversee fertilizer accumulation, and the thirteen commune secretaries, seventy-seven station secretaries, and seven hundred village branch secretaries in the county also personally took charge. After holding a mobilization rally of 20,000 people in the county, the masses were fully mobilized to speak out and debate on topics such as "Is there a relationship between fertilizer accumulation and increased production?", "Is there a source of fertilizer?", and "Can more fertilizer be accumulated to ensure 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu?" In the speaking out and debating, the masses criticized the cadres who neglected fertilizer accumulation, and at the same time criticized the conservative idea of "limited fertilizer sources." More than 35,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the county, and more than 70,000 people participated in the debates. In the speaking out and debating, due to the full presentation of facts and reasoning, everyone's understanding and enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation was improved. Li Lin and Li Cun of Ping Shan Zhai Village, Malanyu Commune, presented the facts of using topsoil from old courtyards as fertilizer, deep digging of soil around the courtyard edges, and diligent padding of the livestock pens to accumulate more fertilizer, criticized the erroneous idea that there was no source of fertilizer, and quickly set off a climax of fertilizer accumulation. Zhang Zengshan, the head of the Beizhai station, used to always say that there was no labor to accumulate fertilizer, but after everyone criticized his conservative ideas, he personally carried a manure basket and quickly led more than 2,500 commune members to participate in the fertilizer accumulation campaign.

While political command enhanced the consciousness of commune members, the County Committee also emphasized the establishment of an appropriate reward system. Each commune conducted necessary summaries of the effective reward methods used in the past, and formulated a new reward system: 1. Each commune in the county has 150 red flags, which are generally floating awards, and are evaluated every ten to fifteen days; 2. The fertilizer accumulated during spare time and the fertilizer that exceeds the task will be priced according to quality, and the commune will pay cash; 3. Rewards will be combined with rank assessment. At the same time, all communes in the county also returned the fertilizer used by commune members in 1958 in the form of money.

The method of combining political command with appropriate rewards has improved the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer, and the fertilizer accumulation campaign has been rapidly launched. The county's 25,000 professional fertilizer accumulation teams have been consolidated, and the number of people accumulating fertilizer in their spare time has increased from 10,000 to 94,800. On December 24th, more than 124,000 people were mobilized in the county to carry out a general battle. Currently, the fertilizer accumulation campaign is in full swing.

    做思想工作  订奖励制度  遵化积肥运动迅速开展
    据河北日报消息　河北遵化县采取政治挂帅与适当奖励相结合鼓舞了群众积肥的积极性，集体积肥和个人积肥同时开展。
    中共遵化县委计划今年每亩施肥五万斤，全县共需肥料五百亿斤。据去年12月15日的检查，全县仅积粗肥八亿五千七百万斤，尚缺四百九十多亿斤。积肥进度慢的原因，主要是思想有问题。有的认为坑泥挖净，粪尿没多少，没有肥源。有的认为积肥给公社，没有什么报酬，因而积极性不高。县委分析后认为：一方面是由于缺乏政治教育工作，某些人仍存有保守思想；另一方面是在公社化以后，没有及时调整积肥制度，特别是缺乏适当的奖励制度，影响了社员积肥的积极性。因此，县委首先抓起了积肥工作中的政治工作，确定一个县委书记专抓积肥，全县十三个公社书记、七十七个站书记、七百个村支书，也亲自挂帅。在全县召开了两万人的积肥誓师大会之后，全面发动群众鸣放辩论了“积肥与增产有没有关系”，“有没有肥源”，“能不能多积肥保证每亩施肥五万斤”等题目。群众在鸣放辩论中，对忽视积肥的干部提出了批评，同时批判了“肥源有限”的保守思想。全县共贴出大字报三万五千多张，参加辩论的达七万多人。在鸣放辩论中，由于充分摆事实，讲道理，提高了大家的认识和积肥的积极性。马兰峪公社平山寨村李林、李存等，摆出老院子表土作肥料、深挖圈边土、勤垫圈等多积肥的事实，批判了没有肥源的错误思想，很快掀起积肥高潮。北宅站长张增山，过去总说没劳力积肥，当大家批判了他的保守思想之后，他亲自背起粪筐，很快就带动起二千五百多名社员投入积肥运动。
    在政治挂帅提高社员觉悟的同时，县委也强调建立适当的奖励制度。各社对过去行之有效的奖励办法进行了必要的总结，制定了新的奖励制度：一、全县各社有红旗一百五十面，一般都是流动奖，每十天至十五天评一次；二、利用工余时间积的肥和超额完成任务的肥按质作价，由社发给现款；三、与评级结合进行奖励。同时，全县各公社还把1958年用的社员的粪，折款归还。
    政治挂帅与适当奖励相结合的办法，提高了群众积肥积极性，积肥运动迅速展开。全县二万五千名的积肥专业队巩固了，工余积肥的人数由一万人增加到九万四千八百人。12月24日全县出动了十二万四千多人，开展了总体战。目前积肥运动正在火热进行。
