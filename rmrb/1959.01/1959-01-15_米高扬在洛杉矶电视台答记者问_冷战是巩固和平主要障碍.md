Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, Los Angeles Dispatch: Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, answered questions from reporter Cautz of the "Los Angeles Times" television station on the evening of the 12th at the invitation of the station. The broadcast lasted twenty-five minutes.

The reporter asked Mikoyan if he thought the situation in Berlin might lead to war. Mikoyan replied that the Soviet Union did not want war. The Soviet Union's proposal for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Berlin and the transformation of West Berlin into a free city was precisely to ensure peace.

The reporter asked Mikoyan if he believed that the American people did not want war? Mikoyan replied that, judging from the mood of the people he had met, the American people wanted peace.

When Mikoyan answered the question of where the main obstacle to consolidating peace lay, he said that the main obstacle was the Cold War. To end the Cold War and eliminate the real threat of war, it is necessary to improve relations between our countries.

The reporter then said that Moiseyev's dancers were good Soviet "ambassadors." Mikoyan wondered what kind of impression the United States had given these dancers. Mikoyan replied that the Soviet dancers were delighted with the warm reception they received in the United States.

We cherish this friendly reception given to our "ambassadors," and the welcome we give to American actors is no worse than the welcome you give to our actors. We are all doing well in this regard.

When asked about the freedom of movement for travelers, Mikoyan said that travelers in the Soviet Union enjoy full freedom of movement. He added that they are only refused visits to military projects, but genuine travelers should not be interested in these things.

The reporter asked if the Soviet Union really intends to surpass the United States in per capita production. Mikoyan replied that this was indeed the case, but we are prepared to achieve this goal through our own labor, and this will not harm the Americans.

The reporter asked him to list the incorrect concepts that Americans have about the Soviet Union. Mikoyan replied that there are many such incorrect concepts and prejudices, and listing them one by one would take up the entire program. When asked if the Soviet people also have incorrect concepts about the United States, Mikoyan replied that they may, but the Soviet people's overall concept of the United States is much more accurate than the American's concept of the Soviet Union.

When asked if he would like to explain what issues he intends to discuss during his meeting with the President of the United States, Mikoyan replied that it would be best not to talk about it.

Xinhua News Agency, January 14th, New York Dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, arrived in New York from Los Angeles on the evening of the 13th. Mikoyan was accompanied by Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov, and others.

At New York's Idlewild Airport, welcoming Mikoyan were: Patterson, the representative of the Mayor of New York City; Taurin, the leader of the American National Theater Association; Sobolev, the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and staff members of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations.

    米高扬在洛杉矶电视台答记者问
    冷战是巩固和平主要障碍
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社洛杉矶讯：苏联部长会议副主席米高扬12日晚间应“洛杉矶时报”电视台的邀请，回答了该台记者考茨的问题，电视播送了二十五分钟。
    记者问米高扬是否认为柏林局势可能导致战争，米高扬回答说：苏联不希望战争，苏联关于所有外国军队撤出柏林和把西柏林变为自由城市的建议正是为了保证和平。
    记者问米高扬是否相信美国人民不希望战争？米高扬回答说，根据他所遇到的人的情绪来判断，美国人民是希望和平的。
    米高扬在回答巩固和平的主要障碍在那里这个问题时说，主要障碍在于冷战。要结束冷战和消除真正战争威胁，就必须改进我们国家之间的关系。
  记者接着说，莫伊塞耶夫的舞蹈家是很好的苏联“使者”，米高扬知不知道，美国给了这些舞蹈家什么样的印象。米高扬回答说，苏联舞蹈家对他们在美国受到的热情招待感到很愉快。
    我们珍视给予我们“使者”的这种友好接待，而我们给予美国演员的欢迎也不比你们给予我们的演员欢迎差。在这方面我们大家都做得很好。
    在问到关于旅行者的行动自由时，米高扬说，旅行者在苏联享有充分的行动自由，他补充说，只是军事项目我们才谢绝他们参观，而真正的旅行者对这些东西是不该感到兴趣的。
    记者问，苏联是否真的打算在按人口平均的生产方面超过美国。米高扬回答说，确实如此，但是我们准备以自己的劳动来达到这个目的，而这对于美国人不会有所损害。
    记者请他列举，美国人对苏联的概念有那些他认为是不正确的，米高扬回答说，这种不正确的概念和偏见是很多的，如果一一列举就会占用了整个节目时间。在回答苏联人是否对美国也有不正确的概念这个问题时，米高扬回答说，可能有，但是苏联人对于美国的总的概念要比美国人对苏联的概念正确得多。
    当问及他是否愿意说明他同美国总统会见时打算谈哪些问题时，米高扬回答说，最好不谈。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬13日晚间从洛杉矶到达纽约。陪同米高扬前来的有苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫和其他人。
