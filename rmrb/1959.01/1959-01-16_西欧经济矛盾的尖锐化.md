    The eyes of the whole world are drawn to the grand plans for the new economic upsurge of the Soviet Union. This plan has been elaborated in the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report on the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965" to be made to the 21st Congress of the CPSU. This plan has enormous international significance.
    The strong development of the Soviet economy, and the further development of the national economies of the People's Republic of China and other countries of the socialist camp, have brought about a fundamental change in the balance of power on the international stage in favor of socialism. In this situation, it is very important to understand the economic situation of capitalist countries and the contradictions that corrode the capitalist system from within. In recent months, these contradictions have become particularly acute due to the struggle surrounding the "European Economic Community" treaty (i.e., the "Common Market" treaty – translator), which came into effect on January 1 this year.
    In March 1957, West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg signed the treaty establishing this "group" in Rome. The treaty stipulates that the "Common Market" will be established by gradually abolishing tariffs and trade restrictions between these countries within twelve to fifteen years, while also stipulating that capital and labor can move freely within this "group", and that a common tariff rate and common trade policy should be formulated for other countries outside the group, and so on.
    The purpose of establishing the "Common Market" is to more closely unite the above six countries, which are members of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, politically and militarily. At the same time, its purpose is also to suppress the struggle of the working people of these countries for their rights, and to suppress colonial national liberation movements. The ruling groups of Western countries have common interests in these types of issues. However, this does not eliminate the deep economic and political contradictions between the major countries of Western Europe.
    First of all, the interests of the various countries and monopoly consortia within this "European Economic Community" are inconsistent. Nominally, all six participating countries in this "group" enjoy equal rights and privileges within the "Common Market". But in fact, West German monopoly capital enjoys more opportunities to get rich. This goes without saying. Even now, West Germany already possesses far greater economic potential than the other treaty participants. It is enough to point out that West Germany accounts for nearly half of the total industrial production of the six countries.
    West German monopoly capital intends to use this treaty establishing the "group" to gain economic control over the markets of the six countries. While participating in the European Atomic Energy Community and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it hopes to obtain atomic weapons in order to ultimately realize some far more arrogant political and military conspiracies.
    In recent months, the contradictions between the participating countries of the "Common Market" and other capitalist countries have been particularly evident.
    The British government has fiercely opposed the "Common Market" in its current form from the beginning. If Britain joins this market, it will lose the benefits it derives from preferential tariffs in trade with Commonwealth countries and accelerate the disintegration of the Commonwealth. If it does not participate in this market, British monopoly capital will lose the opportunity to play the role of economic and political leader of Western Europe.
    In addition, the abolition of tariffs within the "Common Market" by the six countries and the establishment of a unified tariff rate for all other countries will create serious obstacles for British goods entering this market and deal a heavy blow to the British economy.
    The establishment of the "Common Market" poses the same threat to the economies of other Western European countries and most countries, including economically backward countries. At the 12th session of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" participating countries, representatives of Latin American countries, India, Indonesia, Ceylon, Australia, Canada, and many other countries either opposed the "Common Market" treaty as a whole or opposed some of its provisions. Japanese business circles believe that the establishment of a customs union by six Western European countries means the beginning of a "total tariff war."
    Among the countries that have not joined the "Common Market," only the United States believes that it has obtained political and economic benefits from the establishment of this "market." American monopoly capital hopes that the establishment of this "group" will help it seize the Western European market "from within," that is, through American companies that are widely distributed in Western Europe, both existing and newly established, and through participating in local enterprises. In addition, it also hopes to strive to make the "Common Market" lower taxes on American goods.
    The British government has tried every possible means to prevent the "Common Market" from "damaging" the British economy. In order to counter the "Common Market," Britain proposed the establishment of a "free trade area." This "trade area" stipulated that all seventeen member countries of the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" should be included. However, representatives of French monopoly capital came out against this proposal. They worry that British industry, which can enter the "Common Market" without hindrance, will have stronger competitiveness than French industry because it can also buy cheap raw materials from Commonwealth member countries at preferential tax rates.
    In the newspapers and periodicals of countries that have not joined the "Common Market," threats to organize groups to counter the "Common Market" have appeared. In particular, the joint report passed by the representatives' meeting of the entrepreneurs' associations of Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, and Switzerland has already made similar statements. The newspapers and periodicals have already called these countries "the second six countries."
    The "second six countries" threatens to take countermeasures to deal with the countries that have joined the "Common Market." This has caused serious unease to West German monopoly capital because West German exports are close to being evenly divided between the "Common Market" countries and the "second six countries." In the negotiations on the "free trade area," West Germany played the role of mediator between Britain and France, while also putting pressure on them. Last November, France formally rejected Britain's proposal to establish a "free trade area." In order to retaliate against this, the British Foreign Office, under the pressure of industrial and financial circles, announced its so-called "crusade for a free trade area." All the remaining countries of the "second six countries" also supported Britain's position.
    Thus, Western European countries are facing a very acute issue of a trade war between the participating countries of the "Common Market" and the "second six countries." Swedish business circles have already announced that they may not hesitate to adopt "trade war" measures such as refusing to allocate French orders and raising tariffs. Norway has issued a call to revoke shipbuilding contracts worth nearly ten billion marks given to West German companies and transfer these contracts to British and Swedish companies.
    The French government, anticipating the "trade war" that would occur after the "Common Market" began to be implemented, recently implemented a devaluation of the franc in order to strengthen the position of French monopoly capital in the Western European market and raise the prices of foreign goods in the French domestic market. Immediately afterwards, Britain also hastily implemented a limited free exchange of the pound. Other Western European countries such as West Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland also followed suit and took the same financial measures before the New Year. A new wave of currency and financial contradictions sweeping across all Western European countries is threatening to further worsen the living conditions of the working people of Western European countries.
    In order to avoid the intensification of economic conflicts between Western European countries, the countries of the "Common Market" and the countries belonging to the "second six countries" have conducted a series of negotiations involving politicians and entrepreneurs, including politicians and entrepreneurs from the United States. As the "Wall Street Journal" emphasized, American monopolists expressed concern about these negotiations for important economic reasons in addition to political reasons. This newspaper pointed out that some of the largest American companies, such as "DuPont," "U.S. Rubber Company," "Goodyear Tire Company," and many other companies, are establishing new enterprises and expanding old enterprises in the "Common Market" countries. At the same time, many American monopolists also have important branch enterprises in Britain. Therefore, the conflicts between the major powers of Western Europe directly affect the interests of American monopoly capital.
    It should be pointed out that the negotiations on the "free trade area" are being conducted under the circumstances of the new economic crisis symptoms in Western European countries intensifying, which makes the contradictions even more acute.
    During the negotiations between De Gaulle and Adenauer, the West German government supported France's plan to oppose Britain's establishment of a "free trade area." On the other hand, the Bonn government demanded support on the Berlin issue and on the issue of further strengthening West Germany's important position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    At the ruthless haggling at the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" meeting in Paris on December 15, British Trade Minister Eccles did not succeed in obtaining the consent of other countries on the establishment of a "free trade area," but only made the "Common Market" countries agree to relax import quotas for British goods. This meeting did not pass a definite resolution on the issue of establishing a "free trade area."
    In December, new attempts were made at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in Paris to seek ways to reconcile the interests of the two opposing groups in Western Europe. However, this effort also ended in failure. The failure of the negotiations on the establishment of a "free trade area" has given a heavy blow to the notorious "Atlantic solidarity." As British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd said not long ago, it is impossible to imagine "how this tradition of cooperation in the military and political fields can be preserved intact if the tradition of trustful cooperation in the economic field is broken." To borrow a fitting phrase from the French "Le Monde," the "Common Market" treaty has become "the Great Charter of European division."
    It is obvious that although the fierce contradictions between these two groups of Western European countries can be resolved temporarily by sacrificing one party according to their current balance of power, such solutions can at most only temporarily delay new outbreaks of these contradictions between them.
    It is the road to guaranteeing the economic development and peace of the people of all countries to implement broad economic cooperation throughout Europe by the people of European countries on the basis of non-discrimination, equality, and mutual benefit, instead of dividing countries into groups and conducting economic wars.
    The Soviet government has pointed this out more than once in its many special documents and proposals, especially in the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement "On the Establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community and the 'Common Market.'" The Soviet government has put forward concrete proposals to develop cooperation between all European countries in commerce, transportation, science, and technology, and to expand the exchange of each other's production experience through the conclusion of a pan-European economic agreement. However, the Western countries have ignored these constructive proposals from the Soviet Union until now. But as life shows today, this position of the Western countries only causes them to suffer losses first.
    In the skies over Western Europe, the black clouds of economic difficulties and contradictions are gathering thicker and thicker. At the same time, the economy of the socialist countries is experiencing an unprecedented upsurge. The Soviet peaceful construction plan mentioned in the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report on the "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965" to be made to the 21st Congress of the CPSU has opened up brilliant prospects for the Soviet Union to develop economic cooperation with European countries and with all other countries. As Comrade Khrushchev said in his report: "The Soviet Union can and is willing to develop economic ties and trade with all countries." (Translated by Ya from the January 7 "Pravda") (Attached image)

### 西欧经济矛盾的尖锐化

    西欧经济矛盾的尖锐化
    经济学副博士　克·波波夫
    法学副博士　勒·费图尼
    全世界的目光都为苏联的新的经济高涨的宏伟计划所吸引。这个计划已在赫鲁晓夫同志将对苏共第二十一次代表大会作的关于“1959年—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲中加以阐述。这个计划具有巨大的国际意义。
    苏联经济强有力的发展，中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家国民经济的进一步发展，使得国际舞台上力量的对比关系发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化。在这种情况下了解资本主义国家的经济情况和那些从内部腐蚀资本主义制度的矛盾是十分重要的。最近数月来，由于围绕着今年1月1日生效的“欧洲经济集团”条约（即“共同市场”条约——译者）所展开的斗争，这些矛盾更加特别尖锐化起来。
    1957年3月，西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡在罗马签订了成立这个“集团”的条约。条约规定：成立“共同市场”的办法是在十二到十五年内逐步废除这些国家之间的关税和贸易限制，同时并规定在这个“集团”内部资本和劳动力可以自由移动，并应制定对集团之外其他国家的共同关税税率和共同贸易政策以及其他等等。
      “共同市场”的建立所追求的目的是，使加入侵略性北大西洋集团的上述六个国家在政治和军事上更加密切地联合起来。同时它的目的也在于压制这些国家的劳动人民争取权利的斗争，以及镇压殖民地民族解放运动。在这类问题上西方国家统治集团的利益是一致的。但是这点并不能消除西欧主要国家之间深刻的经济和政治矛盾。
    首先这个“欧洲经济集团”内部各个国家和垄断财团的利益就不一致。名义上所有这个“集团”的六个参加国在“共同市场”内都享有平等的权利和特权。但是事实上，西德垄断资本却享有更多的发财致富的机会。这点是不说自明的。就在现在，西德已拥有远较其他条约参加国为大的经济潜力。指出一点就够了，在六国工业生产总额中，西德所占的份额就将近一半。
    西德垄断资本打算利用这个建立“集团”的条约来取得对六国市场的经济控制。它在参加欧洲原子能联营和北大西洋组织的同时，指望能取得原子武器，以便最后实现一些远为狂妄的政治和军事阴谋。
    最近数月“共同市场”参加国和其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾，暴露得特别明显。
    英国政府一开始就激烈反对目前这种形式的“共同市场”。英国如果加入这个市场，它就会损失掉在同英联邦各国贸易中从优惠关税中取得的好处，并加速英联邦的瓦解。它如果不参加这个市场，英国垄断资本又会失掉扮演西欧经济和政治领导者这一角色的机会。
    此外，六国于“共同市场”内废除关税，并对所有其他国家建立统一关税税率，这就为英国货物进入这个市场造成了严重的障碍，并给英国经济以沉重的打击。
    对于西欧其他国家以及包括经济落后国家在内的大多数国家的经济，“共同市场”的建立也造成了同样的威胁。在“关税和贸易总协定”参加国举行的第十二届会议上，拉丁美洲国家、印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、澳大利亚、加拿大以及其他许多国家的代表都或者整个反对“共同市场”条约或者反对它的一些规定。日本贸易界并认为，六个西欧国家建立关税同盟，就是意味着“全面关税战争”的开始。
    在没有参加“共同市场”的国家中，只有美国一国认为它从这个“市场”的建立中取得了政治和经济的利益。美国垄断资本指望，这个“集团”的建立会有助于它“从内部”夺取西欧市场，也就是说，通过美国在西欧现有的和新设立的广泛分布的分公司、通过参加当地企业来夺取西欧市场。此外它还指望争取使“共同市场”降低对美国货物的课税。
    英国政府千方百计地想使“共同市场”不“伤及”英国的经济。为了对抗“共同市场”，英国提出了建立“自由贸易区”的主张。这个“贸易区”规定包括“欧洲经济合作局”全部十七个成员国。但是法国垄断资本的代表却出来反对这个建议。他们担心能够无阻拦地进入“共同市场”的英国工业，由于同时又能利用优惠税率从英联邦各成员国买到廉价原料，将比法国工业具有更强大的竞争能力。
    在没有参加“共同市场”的国家的报刊上，出现了要组织集团来对抗“共同市场”的威胁。特别是英国、瑞典、挪威、丹麦、奥地利和瑞士的企业主协会的代表会议通过的联合报告，已作了类似的声明。报刊上已把这几个国家称为“第二个六国”。
    “第二个六国”威胁着要采取反措施来对付加入“共同市场”的国家，这事引起了西德垄断资本的严重不安。因为西德的出口在“共同市场”国家和“第二个六国”之间接近于各占一半。在关于“自由贸易区”的谈判中，西德在英、法之间曾扮演了调停人的角色，同时对它们都施加了压力。去年11月，法国正式拒绝了英国建立“自由贸易区”的主张。为了对这点进行报复，英国外交部在工业和金融界人士的压力下宣布了它的所谓“为自由贸易区发动十字军远征”的声明。“第二个六国”的其余所有国家也都支持英国的立场。
    于是，西欧国家就面临一个十分尖锐的“共同市场”参加国和“第二个六国”之间的贸易战问题。瑞典商业界已经宣布，可能不惜采用像拒绝分配法国订货、提高关税等等这类“贸易战”措施。挪威已经发出了呼声，要求撤销给予西德公司的价值近十亿马克的造船合同，而把这些合同转交给英国和瑞典公司。
    法国政府由于预见到“共同市场”开始实行后会发生的“贸易战”，在不久前实行了法郎贬值，以便加强法国垄断资本在西欧市场的地位，并提高外国货物在法国国内市场上的价格。紧接着英国也匆忙实行了英镑的有限制自由兑换。其他西欧国家像西德、意大利、挪威、瑞典、瑞士等在新年前也跟着采取了同样的金融措施。席卷所有西欧国家的货币金融矛盾的新浪潮正在威胁着要把西欧国家劳动人民的生活条件进一步恶化。
    “共同市场”各国和属于“第二个六国”的国家为了力求避免西欧国家之间经济冲突的加剧，曾进行了一系列由政客和企业主出面的谈判，其中也包括美国的政客和企业主在内。正像“华尔街杂志”所强调指出的，美国垄断资本家所以对这些谈判表示关心，除了政治原因以外也有重要的经济原因。这家报纸指出，一些最大的美国公司如“杜邦”、“美国橡胶公司”、“固特异轮胎公司”和其他许多公司正在“共同市场”国家内建立一些新企业并扩展旧的企业。同时美国许多垄断资本在英国也设有重要的分支企业。因此，西欧大国的冲突直接影响了美国垄断资本的利益。
    应当指出的是，“自由贸易区”的谈判是在西欧国家新的经济危机症象正在加剧的情况下进行的，这就使矛盾更为尖锐化起来。
    在戴高乐和阿登纳谈判过程中，西德政府曾支持法国反对英国建立“自由贸易区”的计划。另一方面波恩政府则要求在柏林问题上以及在进一步加强西德在北大西洋公约组织中所占的重要地位问题上得到支持。
    12月15日在巴黎“欧洲经济合作局”会议上进行无情的讨价还价时，英国贸易大臣埃克尔斯并没有能在建立“自由贸易区”问题上取得其他国家的同意，而只不过是使“共同市场”国家同意放宽了对英国货物的进口限额。这次会议对于建立“自由贸易区”问题并没有能通过确定的决议。
    12月在巴黎北大西洋公约组织理事会上曾为寻求方法来调和西欧这两个互相对立的集团的利益，进行了新的尝试。但是这次努力也以失败告终。建立“自由贸易区”的谈判的失败已经给了臭名昭彰的“大西洋团结”以沉重打击。正像不久前英国外交大臣塞尔温·劳埃德所说，不可能想像“如果在经济方面的信任的合作传统被打破的话，在军事和政治方面的这种合作传统怎么能够完整无缺地保存下去。”借用法国“世界报”的一句恰当的话来说，“共同市场”条约已成了“欧洲分裂的大宪章”。
    显而易见，尽管西欧这两个国家集团之间的激烈矛盾可以根据今天它们的力量对比用牺牲一方的办法求得某种临时解决；但是这类解决办法至多也只能暂时延缓它们之间的这类矛盾的新爆发。
    国家之间不分裂为集团，不进行经济战争，而是在没有歧视、平等互利基础上由欧洲国家人民来实行全欧洲的广泛的经济合作，这就是保证各国人民经济发展和和平的道路。
    苏联政府曾不止一次地在它的许多专门文告和建议中，特别是在苏联外交部“关于建立欧洲原子能联营和‘共同市场’”的声明中，指出了这点。苏联政府曾提出具体建议以求发展全欧洲国家之间在商业、运输、科学和技术上的合作，并通过缔结全欧经济协定来扩大彼此生产经验的交流。但是西方国家一直到现在对苏联的这些建设性建议仍置若罔闻。可是正像今天生活所显示的那样，西方国家的这一立场只不过是首先使自己遭到损失罢了。
    在西欧上空，经济困难和矛盾的黑云越聚越浓了。同时社会主义国家的经济则在经历着空前的高涨。在赫鲁晓夫同志将对苏共第二十一次代表大会作的关于“1959年—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲中所谈到的苏联和平建设计划，已为苏联同欧洲各国以及同其他所有国家发展经济合作打开了辉煌的远景。正像赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中所说：“苏联可能而且愿意同所有国家发展经济联系和贸易。”　（亚译自1月7日“真理报”）（附图片）
