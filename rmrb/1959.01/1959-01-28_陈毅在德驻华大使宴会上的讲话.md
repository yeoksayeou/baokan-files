Esteemed Comrade Prime Minister Grotewohl, Esteemed Comrade Ambassador Wandell, Esteemed Comrades of the Delegation, Comrades, Friends:

The friendly visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, to our country is about to conclude. We are very pleased to be able to gather with them again before their departure.

The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic's visit to Asia and Africa has achieved significant success. This visit has greatly consolidated and enhanced the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic, strengthened mutual understand and friendly cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the United Arab Republic, Iraq, and India and has further developed the fraternal solidarity between the German Democratic Republic and Vietnam and China. This year is a decisive year for our people's three years of hard work. The visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, to our country once again is a great encouragement to the Chinese people in achieving the 1959 national economic plan. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for their friendly visit.

For the past few days, the people of our country have warmly welcomed our distinguished guests with the feeling of reuniting with old friends. This warm welcome once again demonstrates the profound friendship between the people of China and Germany. For more than nine years, the friendly unity between the people of our two countries has become increasingly close. This unity is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. Therefore, it has unlimited vitality and is unbreakable.

Comrades, friends, although the visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country has only been for a few short days, it has left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. During the visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country, the leaders of our two governments held cordial and friendly talks and reached complete agreement on the current international situation, the continued strengthening of the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the further expansion and deepening of friendly cooperation between our two countries, and issues related to the common interests of our two countries. The results of the talks reflect the firm will and unwavering belief of the people of the two countries in safeguarding and consolidating world peace. Based on the results of the talks, the two governments have issued a joint statement today and signed the Sino-German Consular Treaty. This is a major event in the political life of the people of our two countries and a clear sign of the further development of the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany.

In the cause of building socialism and in the struggle against imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace, the Chinese people have received strong support and assistance from the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic. On behalf of our government and people, I would like to express my deep gratitude for this. Esteemed Comrade Prime Minister, as you are about to leave our country, I would like to express to you once again that, at any time, the Chinese people will continue to fully support the socialist construction of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the just struggle for the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy and for the maintenance of world peace.

Finally, I wish the people of the German Democratic Republic greater success in building their own country and in the struggle to achieve the unification of the German nation into a peaceful and democratic state, and I sincerely ask Prime Minister Grotewohl to bring the friendship of 650 million Chinese people to the German people.

Comrades, friends, I propose a toast:

    To the friendship between the people of China and Germany,
    To the consolidation and unity the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    To the health of Prime Minister Grotewohl and all the comrades of the delegation,
    To the health of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President,
    Cheers!

    陈毅在德驻华大使宴会上的讲话敬爱的格罗提渥总理同志，敬爱的汪戴尔大使同志，敬爱的代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在我国的友好访问就要结束了。在临别之前，我们能再度同他们欢聚一堂，感到非常高兴。
    这次德意志民主共和国政府代表团对亚非的访问取得了重大的成就。这次访问大大巩固和提高了德意志民主共和国的国际威信，加强了德意志民主共和国同阿联、伊拉克和印度的相互了解和友好合作，并且进一步发展了德意志民主共和国和越南、中国兄弟般的团结。今年是我国人民苦战三年具有决定性的一年，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团再次访问我国，对中国人民实现1959年的国民经济计划是一个莫大的鼓舞。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民对他们的这次友好访问，表示诚挚的感谢。
    几天以来，我国人民怀着旧友重逢般的心情，热烈地欢迎我们的贵宾。这种热忱的欢迎，再一次表现了中德两国人民之间的深厚友谊。九年多以来，我们两国人民的友好团结愈来愈加紧密，这种团结是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的。因此，它具有无限的生命力，是牢不可破的。
    同志们，朋友们，德意志民主共和国政府代表团在我国的访问，虽然只有短短的几天，但是却给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。在德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问我国期间，我们两国政府领导人进行了亲切、友好的会谈，并且就目前国际局势、继续加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、进一步扩大和加深我们两国之间的友好合作关系，以及有关我们两国共同利益的问题，取得了完全一致的意见。会谈结果，反映了两国人民为维护和巩固世界和平的坚定意志和不可动摇的信念。根据会谈结果，两国政府已经在今天发表了联合声明，并且签订了中德领事条约。这是我们两国人民政治生活中具有重大意义的事件，也是中德两国人民兄弟友谊进一步发展的鲜明标志。
    中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中，在反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争中，都得到了德意志民主共和国政府和人民的大力支持和帮助。我谨代表我国政府和人民对此表示深深的谢意。敬爱的总理同志，在你将要离开我国的时候，我愿再一次向你表示，无论在什么时候，中国人民将继续全力支持德意志民主共和国人民的社会主义建设和为争取在和平、民主的基础上重新统一德国和维护世界和平而进行的正义斗争。
    最后，我预祝德意志民主共和国人民在建设自己的国家和实现德意志民族统一成为和平、民主的国家的斗争中获得更大的成就，并且衷心地请格罗提渥总理把六亿五千万中国人民的友谊带给德国人民。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议：
    为中德两国人民的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和团结，
    为格罗提渥总理和代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为威廉·皮克总统同志的健康，
    干杯！
