    Cannot Deny the Existence of Inequality in Socialist Society
    A Discussion with Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng on "Distinguishing Two Kinds of Inequality"
    Shi Jian
    Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng's article "Distinguishing Two Kinds of Inequality" on December 3rd of last year explained the difference between the two kinds of inequality in capitalist and socialist societies. I believe this is necessary and correct. However, I think there are incomplete aspects in his view on whether inequality exists under the socialist system, which I am raising for discussion with Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng.
    Regarding the question of whether inequality exists in socialist society, there are two different views: one believes that "after the elimination of the exploiting classes and private ownership, although there are essential differences in the forms of public ownership, and therefore class differences have not finally disappeared, the problem of inequality no longer exists" (see "Distinguishing Two Kinds of Inequality." Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng holds this view); the other believes that the inequality of the bourgeoisie oppressing and exploiting the proletariat no longer exists, but factual inequality still exists. Of the two statements, I believe the latter is in line with the facts, and therefore correct.
    The Concept of "Equality" Should Be Understood Historically
    The concept of "equality" should be understood historically. When the bourgeoisie opposed the inequality of the feudal hierarchy, "equality" contained the progressive significance of anti-feudalism. With the victory of the bourgeois revolution and the establishment of bourgeois rule, "equality" became a tool for the bourgeoisie to cover up its oppression and exploitation of the working people. In the first half of the nineteenth century, after the superficiality and hypocrisy of bourgeois equality were blatantly exposed, petty-bourgeois thinkers, such as Proudhon and Stirner, attempted to expand the bourgeois concept of equality by adding the demand for equality in property relations, forming their petty-bourgeois equalitarian view of equality as equal possession of private property. As for the proletariat's understanding of equality, it also has different meanings with different historical characteristics. When the bourgeoisie's class oppression of the proletariat still existed, the main task of the proletariat was to oppose class oppression, and class oppression was indeed the greatest and most important inequality in class society. Therefore, at that time, the classic Marxist-Leninist writers pointed out that the proletariat should understand equality as the elimination of classes. When the German working-class party wrote the elimination of social and political inequality into its program, Marx and Engels both believed that it was wrong to talk about inequality beyond the demand for the elimination of classes, as it would cause confusion. However, when Marx and Lenin discussed the issue of "equality" in the first stage of communism—the socialist stage—where this class inequality had been eliminated, they criticized Lassalle's idea that "equality seems to be realized" in socialist society. Lenin wrote in "State and Revolution":
    It is wrong for Lassalle to describe such a social system (usually called socialism and called by Marx the first stage of communism) as "fair distribution," as "the equal right of each person to receive an equal product of labor," and Marx analyzed his mistake.
    Marx said: Here there is indeed an "equal right," but it is still "bourgeois right," which, like any right, presupposes inequality. Any right applies the same standard to people who are in fact different and unequal, so "equal right" is inequality, is unfair....
    Therefore, in the first stage of communism, fairness and equality cannot be achieved, and the degree of affluence will still be different, and difference is unfair. ... Marx refuted Lassalle's vague petty-bourgeois statements about general "equality" and "fairness," pointed out the development process of communist society, and explained that this society can initially only eliminate the "unfairness" of private ownership of the means of production, but cannot immediately eliminate "the still existing unfairness of distributing consumer goods according to work (not according to need)."
    Factual Inequality Still Exists in Our Country
    Thus, due to different historical conditions, in socialist society, although inequality in the class sense no longer exists, and the greatest and most fundamental inequality has been eliminated, this does not mean that no inequality exists at all. In fact, inequality still exists. In order to explain the difference between inequality in the class sense and inequality in socialist society, Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng believes that "the problem of inequality no longer exists" in socialist society, and seems to have a sense of resentment and resistance to people talking about this inequality, which is obviously wrong.
    Our country's situation is exactly like this. With the victory of the socialist revolution, we have eliminated the system of man exploiting man, and the inequality like that in bourgeois countries does not exist. Moreover, after the great rectification campaign, the equal relations between people have been further developed. But in general, in our society today, factual inequality still exists in many aspects. First of all, in terms of distribution, we still implement the principle of "distribution according to labor," which, as Marx said, presupposes factual inequality. Of course, due to the limitations of historical conditions, we should not only not deny this principle today, but also fully see its positive role; but we, with communism as our highest ideal, should see its unreasonable side while seeing its reasonable side. Only in this way can our goals be clear, actively create conditions, and prepare for the implementation of a more reasonable distribution principle in the future. Secondly, in terms of interpersonal relations, with the change of the relations of production, and after the rectification campaign of the whole party and the whole people, the ideological style and moral qualities of treating people equally, mutual respect, mutual assistance, and fraternity have indeed been greatly promoted. But it should also be seen that, due to the fact that people's thoughts often lag behind reality, there are still some people who cannot treat people with a completely equal attitude, regard themselves as special, like to put on airs, look down on the masses, and despise physical labor, and such phenomena are not very individual. Thirdly, in terms of rules and regulations, since the liberation of the whole country, we have not only smashed the old state apparatus, but also abolished all laws, decrees, and other rules and regulations that served the old system, and established a series of rules and regulations suitable for and serving the new system. But it should not be denied that some rules and regulations reflect the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights. Such rules and regulations should also be specifically analyzed: some, although still retaining some inequality, are unavoidable under the current conditions, and are therefore reasonable inequality, such as the temporary retention of appropriate differences in wages and benefits, which belongs to this category. Some are unreasonable inequality, which should not be preserved in the present and future society, such as the phenomenon of discrimination against women that has occurred in the work of employing personnel in some units, as well as the phenomenon of excessive disparity between leading cadres and general cadres in the provisions of the welfare system. As for the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between manual and mental labor, and therefore there is also inequality, this is obvious to all. All of this shows that there is still inequality in socialist society, which is an undeniable fact.
    Perhaps some people will say that Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng did not deny that there is still inequality in socialist society. Yes, Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng also mentioned that there is still factual inequality in socialist society, but when it comes to specific issues, he denies that there is still inequality in socialist society. For example, there are still differences between workers and peasants. In the resolution on the establishment of people's communes, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called things that reflect this difference "the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights," but Comrade Cheng quoted Comrade Tan Zhenlin's words in the "Research on the Income and Living Standards of Farmers in Our Country" to explain the rationality of the income comparison between workers and peasants at the present stage, to prove that there is "obviously no problem of inequality" between workers and peasants. Regarding the phenomenon that workers and peasants obviously have inequality in the right to education but is unavoidable within a certain period, Cheng's article said: "Communists only want to change the nature of education, only want to make education get rid of the influence of the ruling class, then there is no problem of inequality." This clearly shows that although Comrade Cheng Zhaosheng admits that there is inequality in socialist society on the one hand, he tries to find various untenable reasons to obliterate this inequality on the other hand.
    Denying Inequality in Socialism Will Hinder Adherence to the Theory of Continuous Revolution
    Our country is currently in the historical stage of building socialism, and this point cannot be confused. However, actual life also puts forward the requirements for increasingly increasing communist factors (especially the requirements for communist education). It is from this point of view that newspapers and magazines have recently launched a discussion on the issue of the remnants of bourgeois rights, the purpose of which is not only to enable the masses to have a clear understanding of the social nature and construction tasks of our country at the present stage, but also to better use communist ideology to educate the masses and improve the political and ideological awareness of the masses. In the discussion process, some comrades committed an acute illness, saying that the principle of distribution according to work, which is still basically applicable in our current stage, is worthless, as if we are about to enter communism immediately. This is of course wrong. As the Central Committee pointed out, this "is not only a rash expression, but will greatly lower the standard of communism in the minds of the people." However, if we deny that there is still factual inequality in socialist society in order to affirm the positive role of the principle of distribution according to work, this is also wrong. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on several issues concerning people's communes stated: "We are Marxist-Leninist proponents of continuous revolution. We believe that there is no Great Wall between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and between socialism and communism, nor is it allowed to be separated; we are also Marxist-Leninist proponents of the stage theory of revolutionary development. , we believe that different stages of development reflect qualitative changes in things, and these stages of different qualities should not be confused with each other." It can be seen from this that the correct attitude towards the problem should be to unify the theory of continuous revolution and the stage theory of revolutionary development. That is, we must proceed from the stage theory of revolutionary development to oppose negating everything and thinking that all remnants of bourgeois rights should be abolished immediately; at the same time, we must adhere to the viewpoint of continuous revolution, admit that there is still inequality in socialist society, and actively create conditions for eliminating this inequality. If we do not adopt this attitude, and in order to oppose the idea of ​​negating everything that transcends the social stage, we say that "the demand for equality has been realized" and that there is no inequality between workers and peasants, this will make people think that everything in our society is ideal enough and there is nothing that needs to be reformed. This goes from one extreme to another.
    Admitting This Inequality While Striving to Eliminate This Inequality
    Of course, admitting that there is still inequality in socialist society is one thing; how to gradually eliminate this inequality in a planned and step-by-step manner is another. Our task is to both admit this inequality and strive to eliminate this inequality. Only by observing the problem dialectically is it correct. In this regard, Comrade Mao Zedong has set an example for us. In his "On New Democracy," written in 1940, when talking about the nature of culture, he pointed out on the one hand: "We should not only distinguish between the propaganda of communist ideology and the social system and the practice of the action program of new democracy, but also distinguish between the communist theory and method as observing problems, studying knowledge, handling work, and training cadres, and the new-democratic policy as the entire national culture. It is undoubtedly inappropriate to confuse the two." (Quoted from Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, page 677) On the other hand, he pointed out: "At present, there is no doubt that we should expand the propaganda of communist ideology and step up the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without this propaganda and study, we will not only not be able to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also not be able to guide the current democratic revolution to victory." (Ibid.) Comrade Mao Zedong both refuted "Leftist doctrinairism," pointing out that "the current revolution is the first step, and it will develop to the second step in the future, and develop to socialism"; and in the section "Refuting the Diehards," he clarified the position and worldview of our communists. When he mentioned the fallacies of the diehards, "Well, since you communists have pushed the socialist social system to the later stage... then, just put communism away for the time being," he pointed out: "Who doesn't know that regarding the proposition of the social system, the Communist Party has two parts: the current program and the future program, or the minimum program and the maximum program. At present, new democracy, and in the future, socialism, these are two organically constituted parts, which are guided by the entire communist ideological system." (Ibid. 657-658) Here, what Comrade Mao Zedong discussed was of course the relationship between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The situation in our country has changed greatly. We have won the victory of the democratic revolution, and we have also won the victory of the socialist revolution. We are actively building socialism and creating conditions for the future transition to communism; however, the spirit and method of Comrade Mao Zedong in observing and dealing with such problems are still applicable today, and the relationship between socialism and communism should also be observed and dealt with in this way. Because only in this way can we skillfully combine the theory of continuous revolution and the stage theory of revolutionary development, thereby correctly solving a series of major problems in our country's revolution and construction, and making our cause move from victory to victory. This method of observing and handling problems is very worthy of our study.

    不能否认社会主义社会中存在的不平等
    对程钊生同志“分清两种不平等”一文的商榷
    石坚
    去年12月3日程钊生同志的“分清两种不平等”一文，说明了资本主义社会和社会主义社会中的两种不平等的区别，我认为是必要的，也是正确的；但对于社会主义制度下有无不平等的看法，我认为有不完整的地方，提出来和程钊生同志商榷。
    关于社会主义社会中有无不平等的问题，有两种不同的提法：一种认为“当剥削阶级和私有制消灭以后，尽管公有制的形式还有本质上的差别，因此阶级差别还没有最后消失，但不平等问题是没有了”（见“分清两种不平等。”程钊生同志就是这种看法）；一种认为资产阶级对无产阶级进行压迫与剥削的不平等没有了。但事实上的不平等还是存在。两种说法，我认为后者是合乎事实的，因而是正确的。
    应该历史地理解“平等”这个概念
    对于“平等”这个概念，应该历史地来理解。在资产阶级反对封建等级的不平等时，“平等”含有反封建的进步的意义。随着资产阶级革命的胜利和资产阶级统治的建立，“平等”便成为资产阶级掩盖它对劳动人民进行压迫与剥削的工具。到十九世纪前半期，当资产阶级平等的表面性和虚伪性露骨地暴露出来以后，小资产阶级的思想家，如蒲鲁东、施蒂纳等人，企图扩大资产阶级的平等概念，把人们要求在财产关系方面的平等加了进去，形成了他们把平等了解为平均占有私有财产的小资产阶级平等观。至于无产阶级对平等的理解，也是随着不同的历史特点而有不同的涵义。在资产阶级对无产阶级的阶级压迫还存在时，无产阶级的主要任务是反对阶级压迫，而阶级压迫也确实是阶级社会中最大最主要的不平等。因此，当时马列主义的经典作家指出，无产阶级应当把平等理解为消灭阶级。当德国工人阶级的政党将消除社会的和政治的不平等写在自己的纲领上面时，马克思、恩格斯都曾认为，超出消灭阶级的要求来谈不平等是不对的，会引起混乱。但当马克思和列宁在论及这种阶级的不平等已经消灭的共产主义第一阶段——社会主义阶段的“平等”问题时，却批判了拉萨尔认为在社会主义社会中“似乎平等就实现了”的思想。列宁在“国家与革命”一文中写道：
    拉萨尔把这样的社会制度（通常叫做社会主义而马克思称之为共产主义的第一阶段）说成是“公平的分配”，说成是“每人有获得同等劳动产品的平等权利”，这是错误的，马克思曾对他的错误进行了分析。
    马克思说：这里确实有“平等权利”，但这还是“资产阶级的法权”，它同任何权利一样，是以不平等为前提的。任何权利都是把同一标准应用在事实上各不相同、各不相等的人身上，因而“平等权利”就是不平等，就是不公平……。
    所以在共产主义第一阶段还不能做到公平和平等，富裕的程度还会不同，不同就是不公平。……马克思驳倒了拉萨尔关于一般“平等”和“公平”的含糊不清的小资产阶级说法，指出了共产主义社会的发展进程，说明这个社会最初只能消灭私人占有生产资料这一“不公平”现象，却不能立即消灭“按工作（不是按需要）分配消费品这一仍然存在的不公平现象。
    目前在我国还存在着事实上的不平等
    由此可见，由于历史条件的不同，在社会主义社会中。虽然阶级意义的不平等没有了，最大的根本性质的不平等消灭了，但是这不等于说任何不平等都没有了，事实上，不平等依然存在。程钊生同志为了说明阶级意义的不平等和社会主义社会中的不平等应有区别，竟认为社会主义社会中“不平等的问题是没有了”，并对人们谈起这种不平等似有不胜反感和抵触的味道，这显然是不对的。
    我国的情况正是这样，随着社会主义革命的胜利，我们已经消灭了人剥削人的制度，像资产阶级国家那样的不平等确实是不存在了；而且经过伟大的整风运动，还更进一步发展了人与人之间的平等关系。但一般说来，在目前我国社会中，事实上的不平等还是在许多方面存在着。首先，在分配方面，我们实行的还是“按劳分配”的原则，正如马克思所说，它是以事实上的不平等为前提的。当然，由于历史条件的限制，我们在今天不仅不应否定这一原则，而且要充分看到它的积极作用；但是以共产主义为最高理想的我们，在看到它的合理的一面的同时，也应该看到它的不合理的一面。只有这样，才能使我们的目标明确，积极创造条件，为在将来实行更合理的分配原则作准备。其次，在人与人的关系方面，随着生产关系的改变，又经过全党全民的整风，以平等待人的互相尊重、互助友爱的思想作风和道德品质，确实是大大地发扬起来了。但是也应看到，由于人们的思想常常落后于实际的缘故，仍然有一些人不能用完全平等的态度待人，自视特殊，好摆架子，看不起群众，轻视体力劳动等现象还不是很个别的。再次，在规章制度方面，全国解放以来，我们不仅打碎了旧的国家机器，而且废除了为旧制度服务的所有法律法令和其他规章，建立了一系列适合于新制度并为其服务的规章制度。但是不应否认，也有一些规章制度反映了不平等的资产阶级法权残余。对于这样的规章制度，也应该作具体的分析：有些虽然还保留了某种不平等，但是在目前条件下是不能避免的，因而是合理的不平等，如在工资待遇上还不得不暂时保留适当的差别，就属于这一类。有些则是不合理的不平等，是现在和将来的社会中都不应保存的，如某些单位在任用人员的工作中曾经发生过的歧视妇女的现象，还有在规定生活福利制度方面，使得领导干部和一般干部过分悬殊的现象都属于这一类。至于在城乡之间、工农之间、体力劳动与脑力劳动之间还有差别，因而也就还有不平等，这是人所共见的。凡此种种都说明，在社会主义社会中还有不平等，这是不可否认的事实。
    也许有人会说，程钊生同志并没否认社会主义社会中还有不平等。是的，程钊生同志也提到，社会主义社会中还有事实上的不平等，但在一接触到具体问题，却又否定了社会主义社会中还有不平等。例如，工农之间还有差别，中共中央在关于建立人民公社的决议中把反映这种差别的东西称为“不平等的资产阶级法权残余”，但程同志却引用谭震林同志“关于我国农民收入情况和生活水平的研究”一文中说明现阶段工农收入对比的合理性的话，来证明工农之间“显然不存在不平等的问题”。对于现阶段工人农民在受教育权利中显然存在不平等的但又是一定时期内不能避免的现象，程文则说：“共产党人只是要想改变教育的性质，只是要想使教育摆脱统治阶级的影响，那末也就不存在不平等问题了。”这都清楚地表明，程钊生同志虽然一方面也承认社会主义社会存在着不平等，但是另一方面又企图找出种种不大能够成立的理由抹煞这种不平等。
    否认社会主义中的不平等就会妨碍坚持不断革命论
    我国目前正处在建设社会主义的历史阶段，这一点不容混淆，但实际生活也对我们提出了日益增加共产主义因素的要求（尤其是共产主义教育的要求）。正是从这一点出发，报刊杂志才在最近开展了关于资产阶级法权残余问题的讨论，其目的不仅为了使群众对目前我国的社会性质和建设任务有一个明确的认识，而且是为了更好地用共产主义思想教育群众，提高群众的政治思想觉悟。在讨论过程中，有些同志犯了急性病，把我国目前阶段还基本适用的按劳分配原则说得一钱不值，好像我们马上就要进入共产主义似的。这当然是不对的。正如中央所指出的这“不仅是一种轻率的表现，而且将大大降低共产主义在人民心目中的标准”。但是，如果因为要肯定按劳分配原则的积极作用，就否认社会主义社会中还有事实上的不平等，这也是错误的。党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中说：“我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，我们认为，在民主革命和社会主义革命之间，在社会主义和共产主义之间，没有隔着也不允许隔着万里长城；我们又是马克思列宁主义的革命发展的阶段论者，我们认为不同的发展阶段反映事物的质的变化，不应当把这些不同质的阶段互相混淆起来。”由此可见，对待问题的正确态度，应该是把不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论统一起来。这就是既要从革命发展的阶段论出发，反对否定一切，认为所有的资产阶级法权残余应该立即废除的思想；同时也要坚持不断革命论的观点，承认社会主义社会中还有不平等存在，并且要为消灭这种不平等积极地创造条件。如果不是采取这种态度，为了反对超越社会阶段的否定一切的思想，就说“平等的要求已实现了”，工农之间已不存在不平等的问题了，这就会使人们认为我们社会的一切已经够理想了，没有什么需要改革的了。这就从一个片面走到了另一个片面。
    既承认这种不平等　又努力消灭这种不平等
    当然，承认社会主义社会中还有不平等，这是一回事；如何有计划、有步骤地逐步消灭这种不平等，又是一回事。我们的任务就是既要承认这种不平等，又要努力消灭这种不平等。只有这样辩证地观察问题才是正确的。在这方面，毛泽东同志为我们树立了典范。他在1940年写的新民主主义论中，谈到文化性质问题时，一方面指出：“我们既应把对于共产主义的思想体系和社会制度的宣传，同对于新民主主义的行动纲领的实践区别开来。又应把作为观察问题、研究学问、处理工作、训练干部的共产主义的理论和方法，同作为整个国民文化的新民主主义的方针区别开来。把二者混为一谈，无疑是很不适当的。”（引自毛泽东选集第二卷677页）另一方面，他又指出：“在现时，毫无疑义，应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，没有这种宣传和学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命达到胜利。”（同上）毛泽东同志既驳斥了“左倾空谈主义”，指出“现在的革命是第一步，将来要发展到第二步，发展到社会主义”；又在“驳顽固派”一节中阐明了我们共产党人的立场和世界观。他在提到顽固派的“好，你们共产党既然把社会主义社会制度推到后一阶段去了……那末，就把共产主义暂时收起好了”的谬论时，指出：“谁人不知，关于社会制度的主张，共产党是有现在的纲领和将来的纲领，或最低纲领和最高纲领两部分的。在现在，新民主主义，在将来，社会主义，这是有机构成的两部分，而为整个共产主义思想体系所指导的。”（同上657—658页）在这里，毛泽东同志论述的固然是民主革命和社会主义革命之间的关系，现在我们国家的情况已经大大改变了，我们取得了民主革命的胜利，又取得了社会主义革命的胜利，正在积极地建设社会主义和为将来过渡到共产主义创造条件；但是，毛泽东同志观察和处理这类问题的精神和方法，即使在今天也是适用的，对于社会主义和共产主义之间的关系问题也应该这样来观察和处理才是正确的。因为只有这样巧妙地把不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论结合起来，从而正确地解决了我国革命和建设中的一系列重大问题，使我们的事业从胜利走向胜利。这种观察和处理问题的方法是十分值得我们学习的。
