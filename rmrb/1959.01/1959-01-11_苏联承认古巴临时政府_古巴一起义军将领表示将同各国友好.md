Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: TASS, Moscow, January 10th: The Soviet government has announced its official recognition of the Cuban Provisional Government.

    The Soviet government's decision was announced by Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in a congratulatory telegram to Cuban Provisional President Manuel Urrutia Lleó. The telegram wished the Cuban people prosperity and success.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: Buenos Aires Dispatch: Argentine doctor Ernesto "Che" Guevara, one of the leaders of Castro's forces, declared in a telephone conversation with a reporter from the Argentine newspaper "La Prensa" that President Urrutia's government would fulfill all the international obligations of previous Cuban governments and would formulate a policy of maintaining friendly relations with the largest possible number of countries, including the Soviet Union.

    Referring to Cuba's policy towards the United States, Guevara said, "I believe that will depend on the attitude of the State Department towards us, not on the attitude of Cuba, because Cuba's attitude has always been correct. You know that when we had not yet seized power, the State Department's attitude towards the Cuban revolution was by no means favorable." He emphasized that the downfall of Batista showed that "a group of unarmed people can start a battle, arm themselves in battle, and destroy the enemy's military system."

    苏联承认古巴临时政府
    古巴一起义军将领表示将同各国友好
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：苏联政府宣布正式承认古巴临时政府。
    苏联政府的这一决定是苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫在给古巴临时总统乌鲁蒂亚的贺电中宣布的。贺电祝古巴人民繁荣并取得成就。
    新华社10日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷医生、卡斯特罗部队领导人之一格瓦拉在同阿根廷报纸“新闻报”记者用电话谈话时宣称，乌鲁蒂亚总统的政府将履行前几届古巴政府的所有国际义务，将制定一项同包括苏联在内的最多数的国家保持友好的政策。
    谈到古巴对美国的政策时，格瓦拉说，“我认为，那将取决于国务院对我们的态度，而不是取决于古巴的态度，因为古巴的态度向来是正确的。你知道，当我们没有取得政权时，国务院对古巴革命的态度决不是好意的。”他强调指出，巴蒂斯塔的垮台表明“一批没有武装的人能够发动战斗，在战斗中武装自己，并且能够摧毁敌人的军事体系。”
