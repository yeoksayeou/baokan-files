Where to Produce, Where to Rectify the Commune
Dawn Commune Closely Integrates Rectification and Production to Promote Each Other

(Our Dispatch) The Dawn People's Commune in Yuci City, Shanxi Province, in its recent rectification, has adopted the method of "where to produce, go there to rectify the commune," based on the characteristics of managing diverse production, implementing unified mobilization of labor, and conducting production in multiple locations. This has led to a new situation in which rectification and production are integrated and promote each other, resulting in a common upsurge.

Since the beginning of winter, the Dawn People's Commune has made full use of the superior conditions of the people's commune in unified management of various productions and unified use of labor. After reasonable allocation, the entire commune's full labor force, semi-labor force, and auxiliary labor force were organized into several professional teams for industry, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, sideline occupations, etc., and a comprehensive winter production campaign was launched. More than 60% of the commune's male labor force were distributed in more than ten factories, mines, water conservancy, and other construction sites several miles or even hundreds of miles away, and投入了 were engaged in production activities such as iron smelting, transportation, reservoir construction, and road construction. The women, elderly, and children remaining in the villages in the commune's various management areas, along with a small number of young and middle-aged people, participated in fertilizer accumulation, wheat field management, and logistical work. Production tasks in both the rear and the front were very busy. In mid-December 1958, rectification work began here. After the commune Party committee and the prefectural and municipal Party committee rectification work teams arrived in the village, they found that the large number of commune members working outside were the main force on the commune's various production fronts. If these people were concentrated back to participate in rectification, production would come to a standstill, which would be detrimental to production development. If the commune members working outside did not participate in rectification and only relied on the male labor, women, elderly, and children remaining in the village to carry out rectification, various ideas and specific problems would inevitably not be fully aired and resolved thoroughly, which would affect the consolidation and development of the commune in the future. Thus, how to achieve a triple harvest of production, thought, and work through rectification became the biggest problem at present. After the commune Party committee and the rectification work team conducted in-depth visits to factories, mines, construction sites, and commune members' homes, and fully studied and discussed, and after ascertaining the common problems that the masses were currently urgently needing to solve in terms of autumn harvest distribution, canteen management, winter heating, cadre work style, labor management, etc., they flexibly adopted the method of "where to produce, rectify the commune there." The entire commune selected fourteen stronger cadres to take charge of the leadership work of rectification and production on each front. Based on the rectification plan and winter production plan formulated by the commune, combined with the local production characteristics, they used production gaps to lead the commune members to launch criticism and debate. The leading cadres in charge of rectification and production on each front regularly summarized the masses' ideological reflections, opinions, and leadership experiences, and promptly reported them to the commune Party committee for research and handling. The secretary of the commune Party committee, the director of the commune, and the responsible comrades of the work team also frequently went deep into the labor sites, on the one hand, to convey the instructions of the higher Party committee and to handle various policies and policies related to the commune's problems; on the other hand, to check and correct shortcomings in the work, truly achieving "two meetings" (leaders and policies meet with the masses) and "two combinations" (combining ideological education with solving specific problems, combining organizing production with rectification work).

After adopting this method, a surge of great airing, great contending, and great debating emerged universally on various production fronts throughout the commune, and production good news also increased. More than 1,200 commune members acting as temporary workers in the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory used production gaps to put forward more than 1,000 oral opinions on autumn harvest distribution, cadre work style, production, and life, and posted more than 550 big-character posters. More than 900 commune members who went out to participate in mining and iron smelting used baskets for carrying ore, which they previously relied solely on the commune for supply. The wear and tear was also very fast, and the commune spent a lot of money and could not buy them, and the supply often failed to keep up due to the long distance. Many people used this as an excuse to reduce transportation efficiency, which affected production. During the rectification, after the debate made everyone recognize the relationship between personal interests and collective interests and for whom they were working, more than 400 ore-transporting commune members took the initiative to collect willow branches on the mountain, self-weave and self-use, solving the problem of insufficient tools and ensuring normal production.

The commune Party committee also concentrated on the common problems currently urgently needed to be solved by the commune members on various fronts, such as excessive concentration of canteens, crowded people; commune members' families had less coal and pocket money for winter; some outgoing commune members needed cotton clothes and cotton shoes and other living problems were promptly handled. The entire commune has adjusted the original 237 large canteens to 271, and repaired 86 dining halls. The commune organized a large number of vehicles to rush back more than 4.2 million catties of coal, and extracted 5 million catties of straw, which were distributed to commune members for heating, so that every household started a stove and every family slept on a heated kang. 15,000 yuan in cash was taken out of last year's income and paid to commune members as wages to purchase supplies. At the same time, more than 30 new sewing factories and shoe factories were established, and a large number of cotton clothes and cotton shoes were rushed to be made. The entire commune also implemented a vacation system. The commune members generally reflected: "Eating well, dressing warmly, sleeping on a warm kang, and having one day off every half month, we have great enthusiasm for labor."

While the rectification work was proceeding smoothly, significant achievements were made in various productions. In just half a month, more than 70% of the commune's more than 60,000 mu of winter wheat has been rolled, top-dressed, and watered; a total of more than 10.3 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated; the construction speed of the seven larger water conservancy projects that have already started, such as wells, reservoirs, and dams, has also doubled compared to the past; more than 20 kinds of sideline production avenues have been opened up, and a revenue of more than 110,000 yuan has been earned; small factories for chemical fertilizers, firecrackers, agricultural tool repair and assembly, grain processing, papermaking, etc. have developed to more than 70, and all have been put into production. The labor attendance rate of the entire commune has increased from about 70% in the past to more than 90%. At present, various fronts of the entire commune are combining rectification of labor management work to carry out the "five checks and five comparisons" red flag competition of checking ideology and comparing enthusiasm, checking labor and comparing attendance, checking work and comparing achievements, checking efficiency and comparing quality, and checking technology and comparing creation, and further push the rectification and production to a climax.

    在哪里生产  在哪里整社
    曙光公社整社生产密切结合互相推动
    本报讯　山西省榆次市曙光人民公社在最近整顿中，根据经营多种生产、劳动力实行统一调动和在多处进行生产等特点，相应地采取了在哪里生产，就到哪里整社的方法，出现了整社、生产互相结合，互相促进，共同高涨的新局面。
    曙光人民公社自入冬以来，充分利用人民公社各项生产统一经营、劳动力统一使用的优越条件，把全社全劳力、半劳力和辅助劳动力经过合理调配，组成工业、水利、积肥、副业等几支专业队伍，全面展开了冬季生产运动。全社60％以上的男劳力都分布在几里甚至几百里的十多处工厂、矿山、水利等建设工地，投入了炼铁、运输、修水库、筑路等生产活动；公社各个管理区留在村里的妇女、老人、儿童和一少部分青壮年参加积肥、麦田管理和后勤工作，后方和前线的生产任务都十分繁忙。1958年12月中旬这里开始了整社工作，公社党委会和地委、市委整社工作组到村以后，发现外出的大批社员都是公社各个生产战线上的主力军，如果把这些人集中回来参加整社，生产就会停顿下来，对生产发展不利；如果外出生产劳动的社员不参加整社，仅依靠留在村里的男劳力、妇女、老人和儿童整社，势必使各种思想和具体问题鸣放不尽，解决不彻底，影响今后公社的巩固和发展。这样，经过整社如何做到生产、思想、工作三丰收，就成为当前最大的问题。公社党委和整社工作组经过深入工厂、矿山、工地和社员家庭访问，充分研究讨论，摸清了群众思想和实际工作中当前迫切需要解决的秋收分配、食堂管理、过冬取暖、干部作风、劳动管理等共同性的问题以后，灵活地采取了在哪里生产，就在哪里整社的方法。全社抽出了十四名较强的干部，分别担任各个战线上整社、生产的领导工作，他们根据公社制订的整社方案和冬季生产计划，结合当地的生产特点，利用生产空隙，领导社员展开鸣放和辩论。担任各战线整社生产的领导干部，定期把群众的思想反映、意见要求和领导经验总结起来，及时向公社党委会汇报研究处理。公社党委书记、社主任、工作组的负责同志还经常深入各劳动现场，一方面传达上级党委的指示和处理公社有关问题的各项方针政策；一方面检查纠正工作中的缺点，真正做到了“两见面”（领导、政策和群众见面）、“两结合”（思想教育和解决具体问题结合，组织生产和整社工作结合）。
    采用这个办法以后，全公社各个生产战线上普遍出现了大鸣、大放、大辩论的热潮；生产捷报也越来越多。在国营经纬纺织机械制造厂充当临时工人的一千二百多名社员，利用生产空隙对秋收分配、干部作风、生产和生活等方面提出了一千多条口头意见，贴出五百五十多张大字报。外出参加采矿炼铁的九百多名社员，过去他们背运矿石需用的筐子，单纯依靠社里供应，磨损也很快，社内花钱多还购买不到，加以路程远常发生供应不及时的现象。许多人以此为借口降低运输效率，使生产受到影响。在整社中，经过辩论使大家认清了个人利益和集体利益的关系和为谁劳动以后，四百多名运矿的社员人人动手，上山采集柳条，自编自用，解决了工具不足的问题，保证了正常生产。
    公社党委会还集中了各个战线上社员们提出的当前迫切需要解决的共同性的问题，如食堂过分集中，人多拥挤；社员家庭过冬用煤和零用钱少；一部分外出社员需要棉衣和棉鞋等生活问题都及时进行了处理。全社已把原来的二百三十七个大型食堂调整为二百七十一个，整修好八十六处饭厅。公社组织了大批车辆赶运回四百二十多万斤煤炭，抽调出五百万斤秸秆，分配给社员取暖，使户户都生起了火炉，家家都睡上了热炕。从去年收入中拿出一万五千元的现金，给社员发了工资，购买用品。同时新成立了三十多座缝纫厂、制鞋厂，赶制成大量的棉衣、棉鞋。全社并且实行了休假制度。社员们普遍反映：“吃好穿暖睡热炕，半月还有一天假，劳动起来劲头大。”
    在整社工作顺利进行的同时，各项生产都取得了显著的成绩。仅在半个月内，全社六万多亩冬小麦已有70％以上进行了滚压、追肥和浇水；共积肥一千零三十多万担；已经动工的水井、水库、筑坝等七处较大的水利工程，进展速度也比过去加快了一倍多；开辟了二十多种副业生产门路，现已收入十一万多元；化肥、火硝、农具修配、粮食加工、造纸等小型工厂已发展到七十多个，并且全部投入生产。全社劳动出勤率由过去的70％左右提高到了90％以上。目前，全公社各个战线结合整顿劳动管理工作，开展查思想比干劲，查劳力比出勤，查工作比成绩，查效率比质量，查技术比创造的“五查、五比”红旗竞赛，把整社和生产进一步推向高潮。　（武赞庭）
