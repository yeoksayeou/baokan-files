Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, January 11th: The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, through organizing high-yield experiments, fully explored and realistically calculated the potential of each production link, so that workers felt confident and had a clear path for the leap forward when discussing the production plans for the first quarter and the whole year. The workers put forward many practical measures and were full of confidence in completing and overfulfilling the state tasks.

The factory's high-yield experiment embodied the spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis. This year, the state requires the factory to produce a much larger number of locomotives and rolling stock than last year. At the beginning of the discussion of this year's production plan, some people believed that the factory's production level last year almost doubled compared with the previous year, and further leap forward would require the state to invest in hundreds of additional equipment and thousands of workers; others proposed targets of increasing production by five or ten times, but without corresponding measures. Based on this situation, the Party committee first organized more than 10,000 workers throughout the factory to study and discuss the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China before and after the New Year. On the basis of understanding the spirit of the documents and combining the mobilization of the masses to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, it continuously organized high-yield experiments throughout the factory to prove with facts that the factory's production could continue to leap forward, and at the same time identify the existing contradictions, difficulties and solutions.

In the experiment, each department, according to its own specific situation, some experimented with the high yield of key products, some experimented with the high yield of key groups, some organized high-yield weeks, and some organized high-yield months. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the entire factory also launched three production upsurges: technical revolution, communist collaboration, and competing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced. Leading cadres and technicians of the factory established mobile offices to help workshops solve problems. In a short period of time, huge potential was tapped in many production links, and the weak links in production were exposed one by one, and were quickly broken through or solutions were found. After testing, the locomotive workshop found that the large furnace section was a weak link. Due to the lack of an 800-ton hydraulic press in this section, other sections were unable to leap forward. The workshop concentrated its efforts, adopted technical measures, and successfully tested the method of replacing the 800-ton hydraulic press with a 250-ton hydraulic press, and replacing the 250-ton hydraulic press with a vertical roller bed. It also improved the design and process, making the capacity of the large furnace section five times greater. After this key was broken through, a high-yield experiment was organized for the entire workshop to assemble locomotives. Within 56 hours, four "Construction" type locomotives were assembled simultaneously, with an efficiency more than three times higher than in the past. After conducting high-yield experiments, the other five main workshops of the factory also tapped a large amount of potential. Finally, the factory leadership balanced the capabilities of each workshop. For the three workshops with significantly lagging production capacity, namely casting, forging, and machinery, the Party committee concentrated the forces of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, and tried to solve them one by one, according to their priorities.

Through this high-yield experiment, the workers had a clear understanding of the production capacity of their departments, and not only initially determined the leap forward plan for the first quarter of this year, but also decided to trial-produce a variety of new types of locomotives and rolling stock to meet the needs of railway transportation.

According to Tianjin Daily: When mobilizing workers to discuss the plan for the first quarter of this year, the Tianjin No. 3 Tool Factory criticized the erroneous ideological tendencies of some workers who ignored difficulties, believing that "this year's tasks can be easily completed," and were content with the status quo, believing that "production according to last year's model is about the same," so that the first quarter's plan could have a greater leap forward than last year, while also being based on practical reliability.

The No. 3 Tool Factory is a small factory producing electric planer blades. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, its output value quadrupled compared with 1957, its profit turned over to the state increased by fourteen times, and its labor productivity increased by more than one and a half times. Under this situation of great victory, some workers developed the idea of ​​ignoring difficulties and believing that everything could be easily accomplished. When the leadership put forward the preliminary production plan for the first quarter of this year, although the plan was much higher than the level in the same period in 1958, some people said: "This plan can be completed while playing." They did not attach importance to actively and meticulously carrying out the work. At the same time, a few people also believed that they had leaped forward a lot last year, and it would be about the same to maintain this level this year.

The factory leadership believes that these ideological understandings have an adverse impact on achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Factory director Zhou Hongkui conveyed the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to all employees, combined with summarizing the factory's production situation in 1958, and talked about the spirit of having both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis. In this way, the workers were inspired by the leap forward experience of last year and established the idea of ​​despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically.

The factory leadership also focused on the following three aspects of work: First, mobilizing employees to calculate details, find key points, and propose measures; second, summarizing and promoting advanced experiences of teams and groups; third, actively finding ways to solve raw material problems. After discussion by all employees, four technical measures were determined to save manpower and improve efficiency: adding grooves to the tablet press, so that the discharge port can be pressed out at the same time as pressing the tablet, without the need to pull the port with a grinding wheel; self-made muffle furnace dies to change manual bending to mechanical bending; self-made grinding machine and improved the method of annealing wood turning knives. After these measures were determined, manpower was immediately organized to design and implement them as soon as possible. The factory also sent people to fraternal factories and relevant factories in other places to understand the situation of leftover materials, and obtained support and assistance. With the raw materials allocated by the higher authorities, the raw material problem was basically solved.

    大连机车厂组织高产试验探查生产潜力
    根据科学计算　制定跃进计划
    既不低估困难又不惧怕困难——天津第三工具厂定计划力求先进可靠
    新华社旅大11日电　大连机车车辆厂通过组织高产试验，充分挖掘和切实计算各个生产环节的潜力，使职工们在讨论第一季度和全年生产计划时，感到心中有数，跃进有路。职工们提出许多切实的措施，对完成和超额完成国家任务信心十足。
    这个厂的高产试验，体现了冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的精神。今年国家要求这个工厂生产机车车辆的数量比去年大很多。在开始讨论今年生产计划的时候，有的人认为本厂去年比前年的生产水平几乎翻了一番，再想跃进就得国家投资增加几百台设备和几千个工人；也有人提出翻五番、翻十番的指标，但是没有相应的措施。党委根据这个情况，首先在新年前后，组织全厂一万多职工学习讨论中共八届六中全会文件，在领会文件精神的基础上，结合发动群众总结去年大跃进的经验，连续组织全厂高产试验，用事实证明本厂生产能够继续跃进，同时找出当前存在着的矛盾、困难和解决的办法。
    在试验中，各个部门都根据自己的具体情况，有的试验关键产品的高产，有的试验关键小组的高产，有的组织高产周，有的组织高产月。全厂并且在党委的领导下，掀起了技术革命、共产主义协作和比先进赶先进的三次生产高潮。厂的领导干部和技术人员成立了流动办公室，帮助车间解决问题。在短期内，许多生产环节挖出了巨大的潜力，生产中的薄弱环节也一一暴露出来，并且被很快地突破或想出解决办法。机车车间经过试验，找出大炉工段是个薄弱环节。这个工段由于缺少一台八百吨的水压机，牵累其他工段跃不上去。车间就集中力量，采取技术措施，试验成功用二百五十吨水压机代替八百吨水压机，用立式滚床代替二百五十吨水压机的办法，并且改进了设计和工艺，使大炉工段的能力翻了五番。这个关键被突破后，又组织了全车间组装机车的高产试验，在五十六个小时内，同时组装了四台“建设”型机车，效率比过去提高了三倍多。全厂其他五个主要车间在进行高产试验后，也挖出了大量潜力。最后，工厂领导上对各车间的能力进行了平衡，对于铸造、锻造、机械三个生产能力显著落后的车间，党委集中了领导干部、技术人员和工人的力量，分别轻重缓急，设法一一解决。
    经过这次高产试验，职工们对自己所在部门的生产能力心中有了数，不但初步确定了今年第一季度的跃进计划，并且确定要试制多种新型的机车和车辆，以满足铁路运输的需要。
    据天津日报消息　天津市第三工具厂在发动职工讨论今年第一季度的计划时，批判了部分职工忽视困难、认为“今年的任务可以轻而易举地完成”，和满足现状、认为“按照去年的样子生产就差不多了”两种错误思想倾向，使第一季度计划能比去年有更大的跃进，同时又建立在切实可靠的基础上。
    第三工具厂是一个生产电刨刃具的小型工厂，1958年在大跃进中，产值比1957年翻了两番，上缴利润增加了十四倍，劳动生产率提高了一倍半以上。在这种大胜利的形势下，一部分职工产生了忽视困难、认为一切事情都可以轻而易举地完成的思想。领导方面提出今年第一季度的初步生产计划时，虽然这个计划比1958年同期的水平提高了许多，但是有人说：“这个计划，玩着就可以完成了。”不重视去积极的细致的进行工作。同时也有少数人认为，去年跃进了很多，今年能保持住这个水平也就差不多了。
    厂里领导上认为，这些思想认识对今年实现更大更好更全面的跃进有不利影响。厂长周洪奎向全体职工传达了党的八届六中全会的精神，结合总结1958年厂内生产情况，讲述了既要有冲天干劲又要有科学分析的精神。这样，职工们从去年的跃进经验中得到了启示，树立了既要在战略上藐视困难，又要在战术上重视困难的思想。
    这个厂的领导上还抓紧进行了以下三方面的工作：第一，发动职工算细账、找关键、提措施；第二、总结推广班组先进经验；第三，积极设法解决原料问题。经过全体职工讨论，确定了四项可以节省人力提高效率的技术措施：把压片机加槽，可以在压片的同时压出料口，不必再用砂轮拉口；自做焖子胎具，把人力压弯改为机械打弯；自制磨床一台和改进木旋刀退火的办法。这些措施确定以后，立即组织人力进行设计和抓紧实现。厂里还派人到兄弟厂和外地有关工厂了解下脚料情况，取得了支持和帮助，加上上级拨给的原料，原料问题基本上解决了。
