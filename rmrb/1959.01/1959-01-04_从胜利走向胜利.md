　　From Victory to Victory
　　By Our Correspondents Chen Jiabao and Wei Zhen
　　Since the Ninth Session of the National Assembly of Vietnam (December 1958) passed and promulgated the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, more than 13 million people in North Vietnam, under the leadership of the Labor Party, have been engaged in a new and historically significant battle.

　　As early as the end of 1957, after the Vietnamese people had victoriously completed the plan for economic recovery, North Vietnam entered a period of economic development. Starting in early 1958, the Vietnamese people have been working hard in accordance with a three-year construction plan. The implementation of this plan will enable North Vietnam to greatly eliminate the extremely backward economic state caused by nearly a century of colonialist rule in just three years, and enable North Vietnam to basically achieve self-sufficiency in the production of agriculture and consumer goods industry.

　　However, the development of the situation in the past year has been faster than people originally anticipated. Due to the extreme enthusiasm shown by the working people on the production front, 1958 became the year of the greatest change in the economic development of North Vietnam. The ever-increasing revolutionary drive of the working people demands accelerating the pace of construction and greatly raising the planned targets. Therefore, the revised three-year plan passed at the Ninth National Assembly is actually a plan for a further leap forward by the Vietnamese people on the economic front.

　　According to the provisions of this plan, by 1960, the total industrial and agricultural output value of North Vietnam will increase by 78% compared with 1957, of which agricultural output value will increase by 73.6%, and industrial and handicraft output value will increase by 86.4%. In industry, the output value of modern industry will increase by 169%. By 1960, agriculture will account for 64.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, while industry and handicrafts will account for 35.3%. In the early stage of peaceful recovery, the ratio between the two was 90% for agriculture and 10% for industry.

　　The annual output of grain in 1960 will increase to 7.6 million tons, which is three times the pre-war level of 1939. At that time, the per capita average will increase from the current 300 kilograms to 500 kilograms.

　　Cash crops, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry will also be rapidly developed within three years. Among them, cotton production will reach 9,000 tons by 1960, an increase of 58% compared with 1957; peanut production will reach more than 5,500 tons, an increase of more than three times compared with 1957; the number of cattle in 1960 will reach more than 2.7 million, an increase of 590,000 compared with 1957; and the number of pigs will reach 5.53 million, an increase of nearly double compared with 1957.

　　In addition to ensuring that daily consumer goods can basically meet the needs of the domestic market within three years, the development of industry will also greatly develop heavy industry. Within three years, the number of industrial capital construction projects will increase by 96, including iron and steel complexes, machine manufacturing plants, agricultural machinery plants, artificial petroleum plants, etc., which Vietnam has never had before. Construction in this area will lay a preliminary foundation for the industrialization of North Vietnam.

　　Within three years, the number of students in North Vietnam will reach 1.63 million. At that time, eleven out of every hundred people in North Vietnam will be students.

　　The above indicators are undoubtedly very advanced indicators, but if you ask the heads of the provincial and county party committees of the Labor Party or the working people of various enterprises, they will confidently tell you that the indicators must be greatly overfulfilled.

　　The socialist transformation is the key to the realization of the three-year plan targets. According to the plan, the rural areas of North Vietnam will basically achieve elementary collectivization within three years, and a part of the elementary agricultural cooperatives will be transformed into advanced agricultural cooperatives.

　　The development of cooperation achieved significant results in 1958. According to statistics, at the beginning of 1958, peasant households participating in mutual aid teams accounted for only 27% of all peasant households, and there were only 170 agricultural production cooperatives. From July to September 1958, the proportion of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams increased to 50%, and the number of agricultural cooperatives tripled, reaching 587. By the end of December, the number of cooperatives had developed to more than 4,700, that is, the number of elementary agricultural cooperatives increased 25 times in just half a year. This situation shows that after the completion of land reform, under the education of the Labor Party, the peasants of North Vietnam are increasingly actively demanding to take the road of collectivization.

　　The Labor Party has adopted a policy of intensifying the transformation of the national bourgeoisie in North Vietnam. Premier Pham Van Dong said in his government work report to the Ninth Session of the National Assembly of Vietnam: "The socialist forces in North Vietnam have far surpassed the capitalist forces." He also said: "We are fully capable of transforming the inherent antagonistic contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class into a non-antagonistic contradiction, that is, carrying out the socialist revolution peacefully."

　　Based on the above policies, during the three-year plan period, North Vietnam will realize the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through various forms of state capitalism. At present, on the one hand, vigorously promote lower-level forms such as processing, ordering, distribution, and agency sales, and on the other hand, pilot projects of joint state-private ownership are also underway. Then, this work will be fully launched. Within three years, hundreds of thousands of handicraftsmen in North Vietnam will be organized into various collective production groups and cooperatives, and the individual economy of handicrafts will be transformed into the collective ownership of the working people.

　　Just as the construction cause in North Vietnam is advancing rapidly and the people's lives are getting better and better, the economic situation in South Vietnam under the rule of Ngo Dinh Diem is deteriorating day by day.

　　Ngo Dinh Diem openly admitted for the first time in his “Republic Day” speech in October 1958 that South Vietnam’s economic recovery plan had not been completed. In fact, it is more accurate to say "getting worse" than just "not completed." According to statistics from South Vietnamese newspapers and periodicals, South Vietnam's rice output in 1957 fell to the lowest level in decades. Since 1958, many places have suffered from disasters, but the South Vietnamese authorities have failed to provide disaster relief. As a result, not only have the broad masses of the people suffered from famine, but the South Vietnamese authorities' rice export plan has also not been completed.

　　Under the impact of "US aid," the textile industry, the main industrial sector of South Vietnam, has closed down 80%. The situation in the sugar industry is similar. The market is sluggish, and shops and foreign firms are collapsing one after another. Even South Vietnamese newspapers have to admit that 1958 was "the most difficult year for South Vietnamese entrepreneurs."

　　For North Vietnam, 1958 was the first year of the three-year plan. The overfulfillment of the industrial and agricultural production plan in this year has made the Vietnamese people more confident in participating in the decisive battle of the second year of the three-year plan. As the organ of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the "People's Daily" said in its New Year's greetings in 1959: "The new year brings new hopes and a better future to our people and the people of the world. We must meet the new year with greater enthusiasm, complete new tasks, and strive for new victories." (Attached picture)

    从胜利走向胜利
    本报记者　陈家保　韦真
    自从越南国会第九次会议（1958年12月）通过和公布了越南民主共和国1958年至1960年的三年计划之后，越南北方一千三百多万人民正在劳动党领导下，投入了一场新的富有历史意义的战斗。
    早在1957年底，越南人民胜利完成了恢复经济计划之后，越南北方就进入了发展经济的时期。从1958年初开始，越南人民就按照着一个三年建设计划在努力奋斗。这个计划的实现，将使越南北方在短短的三年内大大消除由于殖民主义者近百年统治而造成的经济极端落后的状态，使越南北方在农业和消费品工业的生产方面，基本上能够自给自足。
    可是一年来形势的发展比人们原先的预料要快。由于劳动人民在生产战线上发挥了极大的积极性，1958年成了越南北方经济发展上变化最大的一年。不断高涨的劳动人民的革命干劲，要求加速建设速度，大大提高计划指标。因此，在第九次国会会议上通过的重订的三年计划，实际上是越南人民在经济战线上的一个进一步跃进的计划。
    根据这个计划的规定，到1960年，越南北方工农业总产值将比1957年增长78％，其中农业产值将增长73.6％，工业和手工业产值增长86.4％。在工业中，现代工业产值增长169％。到了1960年，在工农业总产值中，农业将占64.7％，工业和手工业占35.3％，而和平恢复初期，两者比例是农业占90％，工业占10％。
    1960年谷子年产量提高到七百六十万吨，即三倍于战前1939年的水平。那时，按人口平均每人将从目前的三百公斤提高到五百公斤。
    经济作物、畜牧业、渔业、林业也将在三年内得到迅速发展。其中棉花产量到1960年将达到九千吨，比1957年增长58％；花生产量达到五千五百多吨，比1957年增长三倍多；牛在1960年将达到二百七十多万头，比1957年增加五十九万头；猪将达到五百五十三万头，比1957年增加近一倍。
    三年内工业的发展，除了做到日用消费品基本上能够满足国内市场需要之外，同时要大大发展重工业。三年内，工业基本建设项目增加九十六项，其中有越南从未有过的钢铁联合企业、机器制造厂、农业机械厂、人造石油厂等等。这方面的建设，将为越南北方的工业化奠定初步的基础。
    三年内，北越学生人数将达到一百六十三万人，那时一百个越南北方人中间将有十一个是学生。
    以上指标无疑是十分先进的指标，可是如果你问问劳动党各省、县党委负责人或各地各企业劳动人民，他们会满怀信心地告诉你，指标一定要大大超额完成。
    社会主义改造工作是三年计划指标实现的关键。根据计划的规定，越南北方农村在三年内将基本实现初级合作化，并把一部分初级农业合作社转为高级农业合作社。
    合作化的发展，在1958年就有显著的成就。据统计，1958年初参加变工组的农户只占全体农户的27％，农业生产合作社只有一百七十个，从1958年7月到9月，参加变工组农户的比例增加到50％，农业合作社增加了三倍，达到五百八十七个；到了12月底，合作社发展到了四千七百多个，即仅半年之内，初级农业合作社的数目增加了二十五倍。这一情况表明，在完成土地改革之后，在劳动党教育下，越南北方农民正在日益积极地要求走合作化的道路。
    对越南北方民族资产阶级，劳动党采取了对他们加紧进行改造的政策。范文同总理在向越南国会第九次会议作政府工作报告时曾经说：“越南北方的社会主义力量已经远远超过了资本主义力量。”他还说：“我们完全有力量把民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间固有的对抗性的矛盾化为非对抗性的矛盾，即和平地进行社会主义革命。”
    从上述政策出发，三年计划期间，越南北方将通过国家资本主义的各种形式来实现对私营工商业的社会主义改造。目前一方面大力推广加工、订货、经销、代销等低级形式，另一方面也正在进行公私合营的试点工作。然后，这个工作将要全面展开。三年内，北越几十万手工业者将被组织到各种集体生产小组和合作社中来，手工业的个体经济将被改造成为劳动人民的集体所有制。
    正当越南北方的建设事业一日千里和人民的生活一天天好起来的时候，在吴庭艳统治下的越南南部的经济情况却一天天在烂下去。
    吴庭艳在1958年10月间的
  “共和节”演说中第一次公开承认南越的经济恢复计划没有完成。其实何止“没有完成”，更确切的说法是“每况愈下”。根据南越报刊的统计，南越稻谷产量1957年降到了几十年来最低水平。1958年以来，许多地方闹灾荒，南越当局见灾不救，结果不但广大人民遭受饥荒，南越当局的大米出口计划也没有完成。
    在“美援”的打击下，南越的主要工业部门纺织业已倒闭了80％。制糖业的情况也差不多。市面萧条，商店、洋行倒风四起。连南越报纸也不得不承认1958年是南越“企业家最难熬的一年”。
    对于越南北方来说，1958年是三年计划的第一年，这一年的工农业生产的超额完成计划，使越南人民更加满怀信心地投入三年计划第二年的带有决定意义的战斗。正如越南劳动党机关报“人民报”在1959年的新年祝词中所说的：“新的一年给我国人民和全世界人民带来了新的希望和更美好的前景。我们要以更奋发的精神，来迎接新年，完成新的任务，争取新的胜利。”（附图片）
