Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, today wrote again to the Prime Minister of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, suggesting that plenipotentiary representatives from both sides conduct formal negotiations to resolve existing disputes between the two countries.

Premier Pham Van Dong's letter was in response to Prime Minister Sananikone's telegram of January 2nd, in which Sananikone denied the Lao army's acts of aggression and stated that the Vietnamese People's Army had invaded Lao territory.

In his letter, Pham Van Dong reiterated that, as clarified in the joint communique issued by the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos on August 29, 1956, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam consistently hopes to develop good neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has a clear position on the border issue, which is: the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two neighboring countries must be mutually respected, and all disputes must be resolved through peaceful consultation.

Pham Van Dong said that, however, incidents of aircraft and troops of the Kingdom of Laos violating the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have occurred continuously in the past period. He repeatedly reminded the government of the Kingdom of Laos in his letters of February 22, March 19, and October 13, 1958, hoping to stop the aforementioned activities to ensure friendly relations.

Pham Van Dong said in his letter that the government of the Kingdom of Laos, in response to his letters of February 22 and March 19, 1958, also admitted to having violated the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and promised to take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. However, until now, the above situation has not improved, and the incidents continue to occur. The Kingdom army has intensified its acts of aggression, reconnaissance, and intimidating propaganda activities along the Lao-Vietnamese border, especially in the Xiang Lap area.

Pham Van Dong said that, in particular, in December 1958, the Lao Kingdom side increased its troops to the border near Xiang Lap, where they added new bunkers, and sent batches of scouts across the border, deep into Vietnamese territory. The soldier of the (Lao army) named No Van, who was captured on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has clearly confessed the above facts.

Pham Van Dong said that Xiang Lap has always been the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and currently, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has sufficient materials and evidence to prove this. Pham Van Dong listed the historical facts and evidence that Xiang Lap is the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and pointed out that the Lao Kingdom army had invaded this area in 1956 and 1959. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter of protest on April 2, 1957, after which, for a period of time, the Lao Kingdom army did not invade this area again. The above evidence clearly proves the territorial sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the Xiang Lap area.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was authorized today to issue a statement, formally refuting the news fabricated by some news agencies and newspapers in the United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam in recent days that three battalions of the Vietnamese People's Army had entered ten kilometers into the territory of the Kingdom of Laos. The statement pointed out that this is a completely slanderous rumor, the intention of which is to expand the situation in order to exacerbate the tense relations between Vietnam and Laos, which only benefits US imperialism and violates the interests of the Vietnamese and Lao peoples.

The spokesman said that the government of the Kingdom of Laos has already denied the Lao army's acts of aggression in a reply telegram on January 2, 1959, and subsequently in a letter written on January 5, 1959. They also said that the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had violated the territory of Laos, and affirmed without any basis that the villages of Trawiene, Da Luo, Ka Pai and the surrounding areas are the territory of the Kingdom of Laos, and demanded that the Vietnamese army withdraw from this area immediately.

On January 6, 1959, the Prime Minister's Office of the Kingdom of Laos issued a statement, believing that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government’s request to the Lao Kingdom government to take measures to stop the actions of infringing the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "may be related to the news spread from Vientiane about the Lao Kingdom government using pressure to dissolve a certain legal political party in Laos."

On January 7, 1959, the Prime Minister's Office of the Kingdom of Laos issued another statement with the same argument, and regrettably repeated the slanderous clichés that US imperialism and its lackeys have always used to alienate relations between nations, using unserious but hostile language.

The spokesman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry believes it is necessary to clarify that the above argument is just a distortion tactic, attempting to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for interfering in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Laos, in order to divert the attention of the people of Vietnam and Laos and world opinion from the continued violations of the territory and airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by aircraft and troops of the Kingdom of Laos.

### 范文同总理再致函萨纳尼空首相  建议两国谈判解决边境争端  越南外交部发言人斥美国制造谎言企图扩大事态

    范文同总理再致函萨纳尼空首相
    建议两国谈判解决边境争端
    越南外交部发言人斥美国制造谎言企图扩大事态
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同，今天再次写信给老挝首相培·萨纳尼空，建议双方委派的全权代表，就解决两国间现存争端进行正式谈判。
    范文同总理的信是答复萨纳尼空首相1月2日的电报的，萨纳尼空在他的电报中否认老挝军队的侵犯事件，并说越南人民军侵犯了老挝领土。
    范文同在信中再一次指出，正如越南民主共和国和老挝王国两国政府在1956年8月29日发表的联合公报中所阐明的，越南民主共和国不断地希望根据和平共处五项原则来发展同老挝王国的睦邻关系。因此，越南民主共和国对边界问题已经具有明确的立场，这就是：两个邻国的国家主权和领土的完整必须得到相互的尊重，各种争端必须用和平协商的方式求得解决。
    范文同说，但是在过去一段期间，老挝王国飞机和军队侵犯越南民主共和国领土的事件连续发生。他在1958年2月22日、3月19日和10月13日的信件中多次提醒老挝王国政府，希望停止上述活动以保证友好关系。
    范文同在信中说，老挝王国政府在答复他在1958年2月22日和3月19日发出的信件时，也承认曾经侵犯越南民主共和国的领空，答应将采取措施制止类似事件的发生。但是，直到现在，上述情况并未改善，事件仍在继续发生。王国军队沿老挝越南边境、尤其是在向立乡一带，加强了侵犯、侦察和恫吓性的宣传活动。
    范文同说，特别是在1958年12月间，老挝王国方面增调军队到靠近向立乡的边境上，在那里添筑新的碉堡，并且派出成批的侦察兵越过边境，深入越南境内，在越南民主共和国领土上被捉到的（老挝军队）士兵诺万已经清楚地供认了上述事实。
    范文同说，向立乡从来就是越南民主共和国的领土，目前，越南民主共和国政府有足够的材料和证据来证实这一点。范文同列举了向立乡是越南民主共和国的领土的历史事实和证据，并且指出，1956年和1959年期间老挝王国军队曾经侵入这一地区，越南民主共和国政府曾经在1957年4月2日写信提出抗议，其后，在一个时期内，老挝王国军队没有再侵犯这一地区。上述证据清楚地证明越南民主共和国在向立地区的领土主权。
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天受权发表声明，正式驳斥近几天来美国、泰国和南越一些通讯社和报纸所捏造的越南人民军三个营进入老挝王国领土十公里的消息。声明指出，这完全是污蔑性的谣言，其用意在于扩大事态，以加剧越南、老挝两国关系的紧张状态，这只有利于美帝国主义，而违背了越南和老挝人民的利益。
    发言人说，老挝王国政府已经在1959年1月2日复电、其后1959年1月5日写信否认老挝军队的侵犯事件，并说越南民主共和国军队侵犯了老挝领土，还毫无根据地肯定说特拉维涅村、达罗村、卡派村和周围地区是老挝王国的领土，并且要求越南军队立即撤出这个地区。
    1959年1月6日，老挝王国政府首相府发表声明，认为越南民主共和国政府要求老挝王国政府采取措施制止侵犯越南民主共和国领土的行动这件事，“可能从万象散播出的关于老挝王国政府将使用压力来解散老挝某一个合法政党的消息有关”。
    1959年1月7日，老挝王国政府首相府又以同一论调发表一项声明，并且令人非常遗憾地用不严肃的但有敌意的语言重弹美帝国主义及其走狗一贯用来离间各民族关系的污蔑性的陈词滥调。
    越南外交部发言人认为必须说明，上述论调只是一种歪曲手段，企图污蔑越南民主共和国干涉老挝王国内政，以便转移越老两国人民和世界舆论对老挝王国飞机和军队继续侵犯越南民主共和国的领土和领空的注意。
