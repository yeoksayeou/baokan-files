Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 13th. While vigorously increasing the production of iron and steel products, Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) factories and mines have promoted the communist spirit of cooperation by transferring ten thousand cadres and workers in 1958 to support the production and construction of the iron and steel industry in twenty-five provinces (regions) and cities across the country.

The number of cadres and workers Ansteel transferred to support various regions this year was more than in any previous year. The more than four thousand three hundred cadres transferred last year were equivalent to twice the number of cadres supported in various regions during the First Five-Year Plan. This included six hundred managerial cadres for production technology above the level of section chief and engineer, and more than two thousand technicians and work section leaders. Whatever managerial cadres and skilled workers are needed by iron and steel complexes, Ansteel has them. Among them were company managers, factory directors, mine directors, workshop directors, chief engineers, engineers, technicians, etc.

Many of the transferred cadres and workers were the backbone force painstakingly cultivated by Ansteel over the years. For example, Shao Xianghua, Chief Engineer of Ansteel and Director of the Central Laboratory; Yang Weihou, Chief Engineer of Ansteel and Deputy Director of the Equipment Department; Zhou Chuandian, Ironmaking Engineer and Deputy Director of the Ironmaking Plant; Li Fengen, the famous Anshan Model Worker and Deputy Chief Technician of the Ironmaking Plant; and Wang Hongshun, the blast furnace foreman who repeatedly set new ironmaking records, were all transferred last year to support the production and construction of newly built iron and steel enterprises in various regions.

The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of various factories and mines all regarded the transfer of technical personnel to support the construction of the national iron and steel industry as a glorious and unshirkable task. Under the circumstances that the production tasks were more arduous than in any previous year and the manpower felt insufficient, the Party committees of various factories and mines actively mobilized the masses, improved labor organization, promoted the advanced experience of multi-skilled workers, and tried their best to improve work efficiency, so that the best cadres and workers could be transferred to support various regions. The Ansteel Ironmaking Plant, which was responsible for supporting the Baotou Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel and other three ironmaking plants, transferred a complete set of backbone forces among the plant's leading cadres, engineers, and technicians in a very short period of time. The hot rolling section of the seamless steel tube plant is the key process of production, with a total of five foremen who had studied in the Soviet Union. When newly built seamless steel tube plants elsewhere urgently needed skilled foremen, they did not hesitate to transfer these five foremen. And they took emergency measures to train a group of veteran workers to become foremen.

While transferring a large number of technical personnel to various parts of the country, Ansteel also trained tens of thousands of cadres and workers for iron and steel enterprises in various regions in 1958, which is about three and a half times the total number of personnel trained for various regions during the First Five-Year Plan. The Party committees of various factories and mines adopted the method of combining collective education and individual education, combining technical theory education and practical operation, combining political and technical education, and combining opening training classes and signing master-apprentice contracts, so that some apprentices and workers who came to Ansteel to study could basically master the skills of practical operation in a few months or half a year.

    鞍钢万名职工支援全国
    新华社鞍山13日电　鞍钢各厂矿在大力增产钢铁产品的同时，发扬先人后己的共产主义协作精神，1958年共抽调出一万名干部和工人，支援了全国二十五个省（区）、市的钢铁工业的生产建设。
    鞍钢在这一年抽调支援各地的干部和工人，比过去任何一年都多。去年抽调的四千三百多名干部，相当于第一个五年计划期间支援各地干部数量的两倍，其中包括六百名科长、工程师以上的各级生产技术管理干部和二千多名技术员、工段长等。凡是钢铁联合企业所需要的管理干部和技术工人，应有尽有。他们之中，有公司经理、厂长、矿长、车间主任、总工程师、工程师、技师等。
    抽调的干部和工人中，有许多是经过鞍钢几年来苦心培养的骨干力量。例如，鞍钢总工程师兼中央试验室主任邵象华，鞍钢总工程师兼设备处副处长杨维厚，炼铁工程师兼炼铁厂副厂长周传典，著名的鞍山市特等劳动模范、炼铁厂炉前副总技师李凤恩，屡次创炼铁新纪录的高炉炉长王洪顺等，去年都先后被调出支援各地新建钢铁企业的生产和建设工作。
    中共鞍山市委和各厂矿党委，都把抽调技术力量支援全国钢铁工业的建设，看作是一项义不容辞的光荣任务。在生产任务比过去任何一年都繁重而人力又感不足的情况下，各厂矿党委都积极发动群众，改进劳动组织，推行多面手的先进经验，尽可能地提高工作效率，把最好的干部和工人抽调出来支援各地。负责支援包钢、武钢等三个炼铁厂的鞍钢炼铁厂，在很短的时间内，曾把本厂的领导干部、工程师和技术工人中的骨干力量，成套地抽调出来。无缝钢管厂热轧工段是这个厂生产的关键工序，共有五个工长，都是到苏联学习过的。当别的地方新建无缝钢管厂急需技术熟练的工长时，他们就毫不犹豫地将这五个工长抽调出去。并且采取紧急措施，训练一批老工人当工长。
    在为全国各地输送大批技术力量的同时，1958年鞍钢还为各地钢铁企业培养了数万名干部和工人，约等于第一个五年计划期间为各地培训人员总数的三倍半。各厂矿党委采取集体教育和个别教育相结合，技术理论教育和实际操作相结合，政治与技术教育相结合，开训练班和订师徒合同相结合的办法，使一些到鞍钢学习的徒工和工人在几个月或半年左右的时间内，就基本上掌握了实际操作的技能。
