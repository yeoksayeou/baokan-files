To develop diversified economy, we must strive for abundant results
By Yu Yonghe, Party Secretary of the Weihe People's Commune, Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang

After listening to and discussing the report of the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, my mind became clearer. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party is a key point. What was not very clear in the past is now clear. The point that I have the deepest understanding of is that in all the work of the commune, we must use the method of walking on two legs. Taking our commune as an example, one of the central tasks is to implement the policy of giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production.

The new year has already begun. In accordance with the spirit of walking on two legs, we have initially discussed the work arrangements for this year. After discussion, everyone clarified that in addition to self-sufficient production, to vigorously develop commodity production, we must carry out diversified operations. How to carry out diversified operations? Based on the specific conditions of our commune, we put forward the slogan of "ten raisings, ten plantings, and ten demands."

"Ten raisings" refers to raising pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, fish, rabbits, bees, silkworms, and frogs. Taking pigs as an example, last year the entire commune only had 2,200 heads. This year we plan to develop it to 30,000 heads. Last year there were only more than 40,000 chickens and ducks, and this year we plan to develop to 230,000, and plan to produce 800,000 eggs and 50,000 jin of duck eggs. We know that firmly grasping meat and eggs is an important link in supporting the country and increasing the income of the commune. "Ten plantings" refers to planting vegetables, fruit trees, strawberries, wild grapes, wild ginseng, fritillaria ussuriensis (a medicinal material), tobacco leaves, hemp, white melon seeds, and armillaria mellea (a mushroom). "Ten demands" refers to demanding ginseng from the mountains and fields; demanding oil, wine, and sugar from wild fruits and seeds; demanding hides, fur, and meat from wild animals; demanding cotton and seeds from wild plants; demanding small farm tools and fuel from the forests; demanding wealth from underground treasures; demanding oil from pine roots; demanding seeds from trees; demanding mushrooms from fallen trees; demanding iron and steel raw materials from waste products. In short, we are determined to carry out diversified operations in every possible way. We have calculated that, as a result of vigorously developing diversified operations and commodity production, this year we expect cash income (excluding agriculture) to reach 6 million yuan, while last year it was only 1.6 million yuan. With this cash income, the production expenses of our commune and the wages of the members are guaranteed.

When we discussed this year's plan, we all saw that walking on two legs, giving equal importance to self-sufficient production and commodity production, and carrying out diversified operations can achieve "four changes." That is: turning nothing into something, turning less into more, turning slow into fast, and turning small satellites into large satellites. From here, we also see that on our commune's 6,400 square kilometers of land, the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results will blossom and bear fruit this year in the garden of diversified operations.

    多种经营要花多果实
    黑龙江尚志县苇河人民公社党委书记　于永和
    在全国农业先进单位代表会议上，听了并讨论了党中央负责同志的报告，脑子更清楚了。咱们党的八届六中全会决议是个节骨眼，过去不大清楚的，现在看得清了。我体会最深的一点是，在公社的一切工作中，都要运用两条腿走路的方法。拿咱们公社来说，其中一个中心是要贯彻自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针。
    新的一年，已经开始了。我们根据两条腿走路的精神，初步讨论了今年的工作安排。经过讨论，大家明确了：除了自给性生产外，要大搞商品性生产，就必须开展多种经营。怎么样开展多种经营呢？根据咱们公社的具体情况，我们提出了“十养、十种、十要”的口号。
    “十养”就是指养猪、养马、养牛、养羊、养家禽、养鱼、养兔、养蜂、养蚕、养蛤蟆。拿猪来说，去年全社才二千二百头，今年我们计划发展到三万头，鸡鸭去年才四万多只，今年准备发展到二十三万只，并计划产鸡蛋八十万个、产鸭蛋五万斤。我们晓得，紧紧地抓住肉和蛋两项，是当前支援国家、增加公社收入的一个重要环节。“十种”就是指种蔬菜、种果树、种草莓、种山葡萄、种山人参、种平贝（一种药材）、种烟叶、种麻、种白瓜籽、种元蘑。“十要”就是向山野要人参；向野果、野籽要油、酒、糖；向野生动物要皮、毛、肉；向野生植物要棉、籽；向森林要小农具和燃料；向地下宝藏要财富；向松根要油；向树要籽；向倒木要蘑菇；向废品要钢铁原料。总之，我们决定千方百计地开展多种经营。我们计算了一下，这样大力发展多种经营和商品性生产的结果，今年我们预计现金收入（不包括农业）可达到六百万元，而去年才一百六十万元。有了这笔现金收入，咱们公社的生产开支和社员的工资，都有了保证。
    咱们在讨论今年规划时都看到，用两条腿走路、自给性生产和商品性生产并举，开展多种经营，就能做到“四变”。这就是：无变有，少变多、慢变快、小卫星变大卫星。我们从这里也看到，在咱们公社六千四百平方公里的土地上，党的多快好省的建设总路线，今年将在多种经营的园地里开花结果。
