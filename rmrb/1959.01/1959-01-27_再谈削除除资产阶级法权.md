Re-examining the Abolition of Bourgeois Right
Zheng Jiqiao

	Gaining without labor is not the distribution principle of capitalism. The phenomena arising from the private system should not be confused with the social distribution principle.

	In the discussion on the issue of bourgeois right, some comrades have proposed that "distribution according to work" is not a bourgeois right, but rather a negation of bourgeois right. They argue this because they believe that the distribution principle of capitalism is gaining without labor, more labor with less gain, or even laboring without any gain. This understanding is inaccurate. It is true that in capitalist society, phenomena such as gaining without labor exist and are widespread. It is precisely because of this that the masses of people rise up to revolt and overthrow this society. However, it cannot be considered that gaining without labor is the distribution principle of capitalist society, because, clearly, in capitalist society, not all "non-laborers" can "gain." Only the bourgeoisie, that is, those who own the means of production, can gain without labor. Thus, the fundamental reason for the emergence of gaining without labor lies not in taking "gaining without labor" as the distribution principle, but in the private ownership of the means of production.

	The existence of private ownership of the means of production in society leads to the class that owns the means of production becoming the leader of production and, consequently, the host of social distribution, as Marx said. In this way, they can occupy a large amount of social wealth. This is the basis on which the exploiting classes in class societies can "gain without labor."

	However, consistent with the relationship between the exploiting class and the producers, the ways in which the exploiting classes occupy a large amount of social product, that is, the modes of exploitation, are different in different class societies. In slave society, slave owners occupy all the products produced by slaves, and then use a small portion of it to provide slaves with an extremely impoverished life that barely prevents them from starving to death. In feudal society, peasants are forced to hand over most of their produce to landlords as rent or tribute, and perform some unpaid labor for the landlords. Only in capitalist society does the bourgeoisie use "equivalent exchange" to purchase the labor of wage laborers, producing surplus value for them. Exploiting surplus value – this is the secret of the bourgeoisie's "gaining without labor." This secret was revealed by Marx. It is therefore inappropriate to confuse the phenomena arising from the private system with the social distribution principle.

	From a legal perspective, the method of distribution according to work embodies the "equality" principle of bourgeois right.

	The bourgeoisie enriches itself by exploiting the surplus value of wage laborers. However, as everyone knows, the surplus labor that produces surplus value and the necessary labor that produces the value of the means of subsistence needed by the families of wage laborers are mixed together. Therefore, in terms of the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages they pay to this or that worker is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, "how much work you do, how much money you get," either by the day or by the quantity of products, more work, more pay, less work, less pay. This is reflected in law as the equality that the bourgeoisie speaks of. Conversely, from a legal point of view, this method of "distribution according to work" embodies the "equality" principle of bourgeois right. Therefore, we say that this distribution principle is bourgeois right. The reason we say this is to distinguish it from other rights that have existed in history, namely, the rights of slave society and feudal society.

	In the primary stage of communism, that is, socialist society, we have adopted the principle of "distribution according to work." Socialist society is a society without exploitation, which is fundamentally different from capitalist society. The reason why this society is fundamentally different from capitalist society is not in "distribution according to work" itself, but in the most fundamental thing in the social system, namely, the change in ownership. We have abolished the private ownership of the means of production, thus making the leaders of social production and the hosts of distribution no longer the bourgeoisie but the people's state (ownership by the whole people) or a group of laborers (collective ownership). Here, the remuneration directly obtained by the working people is not "unconditionally" for their "labor income," that is, the products produced by labor, but all the "discounts" are not owned by any private individual, but are owned by the whole people or collectively in the form of state profits or public accumulation, etc. These "discounts" are all converted back to directly or indirectly benefit the members of this society. Under these conditions, the contradiction between the principle of "distribution according to work" and practice is eliminated, and it is no longer a way for the exploiting class to exploit the working people (capitalist exploitation), but has become the main principle of distribution among the working people.

	Thus, in socialist society, the revolution of the distribution method that people speak of, the compelling of the bourgeoisie to work to support themselves and forcing them to transform themselves, and the making of the principle of "distribution according to work" no longer contradictory to practice and able to embody the will of the proletariat, are all not because of the factors of "distribution according to work" itself, but because of the change in the most fundamental thing, the ownership of the means of production.

	Therefore, Marx opposed the view that regards distribution as the essence of things. He said: "It is completely wrong to regard the so-called distribution (referring to the distribution principle – author) as the essence of things and place the emphasis on it." He further elaborated: "Any distribution of consumer goods (referring to the state of social members' possession of consumer goods – author) is always only the consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves." (See "Critique of the Gotha Program")

	What is opposed to distribution according to work is distribution according to need. Therefore, it cannot be said that distribution according to work is the negation of the capitalist distribution principle or the negation of bourgeois right.

	People often say that "distribution according to work" is opposed to the distribution principle of capitalism. Such a statement cannot be said to be clear in concept. In fact, what is opposed to "distribution according to work" is "distribution according to need." Originally, the main manifestation of the opposition between capitalist and communist societies lies in the ownership of the means of production and the social distribution principle. One is private ownership of the means of production, and the other is public ownership of the means of production; one is distribution based on people's labor as the measure, and the other is distribution based on people's needs. Of course, the ownership of the means of production is the most fundamental thing. Without the change in the ownership of the means of production, that is, the change from private ownership to public ownership, there will be no change in the distribution principle, that is, the change from "distribution according to work" to "distribution according to need." However, in addition to the necessary change in ownership, this change in distribution principle also requires some other conditions, the main ones being the extreme abundance of products and the great improvement of people's ideological consciousness and moral character. Although the abolition of private ownership is the most fundamental, it is relatively easy to achieve. As long as the proletariat and the masses of people succeed in the revolution and establish a proletarian dictatorship, this problem is not difficult to solve. However, making products extremely abundant and greatly improving people's ideological consciousness and moral character is not something that can be achieved overnight. It cannot be achieved at the same time as the abolition of private ownership. Thus, before reaching communist society, society will appear and must have such a stage: on the one hand, the private ownership of the means of production, that is, the most fundamental thing in bourgeois right, is abolished; on the other hand, in the main distribution principle, the "equality" principle of bourgeois right with labor as the measure, that is, "distribution according to work," is retained. The abolition of the private ownership of the means of production distinguishes this society from capitalist society, which is a fundamentally different system. The retention of "distribution according to work" in the main distribution principle distinguishes this society from communist society, which belongs to the same category but is in a different stage. This society is our socialist society. This situation of socialist society precisely shows that although it is fundamentally different from capitalist society, it is not the ultimate society we want to build, but only a transitional society.

	From this, it can be seen that it cannot be said that "distribution according to work" is the negation of the capitalist distribution principle or the negation of bourgeois right. If that were correct, then when the distribution principle of "distribution according to need" is implemented in the communist stage, it would be the negation of the negation of the capitalist distribution principle or bourgeois right, and such a statement is obviously inappropriate.

	The statement that "distribution according to work" is bourgeois right originally came from Marx and Lenin. It is correct to oppose some people's comprehensive negation of "distribution according to work," but one should not say that "distribution according to work" is not bourgeois right because of opposing that erroneous proposition. As for bourgeois right and bourgeois-style right, there is only a difference in wording, and there is no difference in the original meaning. Because no matter how you say it, it is in terms of its origin, not meaning that "distribution according to work" in socialist society still represents the interests of the bourgeoisie. As for saying that "distribution according to work" is bourgeois right, it certainly does not mean that bourgeois right is only "distribution according to work." This is just as saying that humans are animals does not mean that animals are only humans. It is a logical specific affirmation and does not need to be explained.

	One should not arbitrarily reverse and quote Lenin's original words to draw conclusions that contradict Lenin's original intentions. Lenin affirmed that the principle of distribution according to work is bourgeois right.

	Here, I will give an example of an incorrect quotation of the words of the classic authors. Giving this example is also helpful for explaining this issue. In Comrade Wu Dingqiu's article "A Comprehensive Evaluation of 'Remuneration According to Labor'" (see People's Daily, November 19, 1958), there is the following passage:

	"From this, it can be concluded that the socialist principle of 'he who does not work, neither shall he eat' has been realized, and the socialist principle of 'receiving an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor' has also been realized" (Lenin: State and Revolution, p. 118). Here, it is much more equal than the extremely unequal bourgeois right. Here, "bourgeois-style right no longer exists." (Lenin's words)

	How should this passage be understood? Obviously: "Bourgeois-style right no longer exists" after the realization of "distribution according to work." But Lenin's passage is as follows:

	Therefore, in the first stage of communist society (usually called the socialist stage), bourgeois-style right has not been completely abolished, but only partially abolished, only within the scope of the economic reforms that have been achieved, that is, only in relation to the means of production. Bourgeois-style right recognizes that the means of production are the private property of certain individuals. Socialism turns it into public property. Within this limit – and only within this limit – bourgeois-style right no longer exists.

	However, it still exists in its other part. It is still the regulator (determiner) of the distribution of products and the distribution of labor among the members of society. The socialist principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" has been realized; the socialist principle of "receiving an equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor" has also been realized. However, this is not yet communism. This has not yet eliminated the "bourgeois-style right" that recognizes unequal people receiving equal amounts of products for unequal (actually unequal) labor. (See State and Revolution)

	Lenin's passage is very clear: In socialist society, "bourgeois-style right" no longer exists only within the limit of turning private property into public property. In the distribution of products and the distribution of labor among the members of society (Note: that is, referring to the principle of implementing "distribution according to work" – author), bourgeois right "still exists." Why arbitrarily reverse and combine Lenin's words to draw a conclusion that is completely contrary to Lenin's original meaning? Although Comrade Wu Dingqiu later said some vague words such as "remuneration according to labor contains the remnants of bourgeois right," in this passage, he reversed Lenin's meaning, which I think is not an attitude that should be adopted in theoretical work.

	Distribution according to work is not the only form of socialist distribution. The labor insurance and welfare system and the distribution system combining supply and wages in rural areas break through the scope of distribution according to work. As for the error of completely negating the necessity of adopting "distribution according to work" at the present stage, many articles have already discussed it. The fundamental problem is that such a proposition is divorced from materialism. The main adoption of the distribution principle of "distribution according to work" in socialist society is determined by the state of social development. Although it is bourgeois right in its origin, adopting it at this stage is beneficial to social production, and thus becomes the main distribution principle of socialist society. Because the distribution principle should mainly be subordinate to the state of production. The specific state of production is the material existence of society, the economic base. The principle of distribution is the basis for people to determine the distribution of products and belongs to the superstructure. Subjective will and objective reality, the superstructure and the economic base must be adapted. Then, they can turn around and influence objective reality and promote the development of the economic base. Before the products are extremely abundant, completely negating the distribution principle of "distribution according to work" will not only not promote the development of production, but will also cause some links of social production to lose regulation and create some confusion in society, which is not beneficial to the development of production.

	Of course, in socialist society, "distribution according to work" is only mainly implemented, not exclusively implemented. In our country, as everyone knows, in addition to paying a certain amount of wages according to the quantity and quality of people's labor, workers have had a labor insurance and welfare system from the beginning. This labor insurance and welfare is naturally also an aspect of social distribution, and this part has already broken through "distribution according to work." After the development of production, many rural areas have also implemented a distribution system of partial supply and partial wages. The part of supply more clearly breaks through "remuneration according to labor." Of course, this is a communist factor, but it is implemented in the socialist stage after all. And this situation is in line with the dialectical law. Because since "distribution according to work" and "distribution according to need" are opposed, then it is normal for the socialist society that implements remuneration according to labor to have the factor of its opposite, "distribution according to need." It is just that the main aspect of the contradiction at this time cannot but be "remuneration according to labor." Later, with the development of society, the two aspects of this contradiction develop in opposite directions, that is, gradually increasing the aspect of "according to need" and gradually eliminating the aspect of "according to labor" (referring to the general trend, not referring to the specific measures of a period). Finally, after how many days the aspect of "according to labor" is eliminated, our society will enter the communist era. Therefore, it is also inaccurate to think that "remuneration according to labor" is the only distribution principle of socialist society. Because that would solidify the position of "remuneration according to labor" in socialist society and ignore the development trend from socialism to communism.

	"Remuneration according to labor" will eventually be negated. But it is a bit too early to completely negate it now!

专栏：关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论

    再谈削除除资产阶级法权
    郑季翘
    不劳而获并不是资本主义的分配原则，不应当把私有制度产生的现象和社会的分配原则混淆起来
    在关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论中，有的同志提出“按劳分配”不是资产阶级法权，而是资产阶级法权的否定。他们所以这样主张，是因为他们认为资本主义的分配原则是不劳而获，多劳少获，甚至劳而不获。这样的认识是不确切的。不错，在资本主义社会，不劳而获等现象是存在的，并且是普遍存在的，正因为这样，人民大众才起来进行革命，推翻这个社会。但是却不能认为不劳而获等等，是资本主义社会的分配原则，因为，很显然，在资本主义社会并不是所有的“不劳者”都可以有“获”，仅仅是资产阶级即拥有生产资料的人才可以不劳而获。可见，产生不劳而获的根本原因，不在于把“不劳而获”当作分配原则，而在于生产资料的私有制度。
    社会存在着生产资料的私有制度，因而如马克思所说，占有生产资料的阶级便成为生产的领导者，因而也成为社会分配的主持者。这样，他们便可以占有大量的社会财富。这就是阶级社会剥削阶级所以能够“不劳而获”的根据。
    但是，和剥削阶级对生产者的关系相一致，在各个不同的阶级社会，剥削阶级占有大量社会产品的方式即剥削的方式是不相同的。奴隶社会是奴隶主占有全部奴隶生产的产品，然后用其中的一小部分，供奴隶过极其贫困的、仅仅不至饿死的生活；封建社会，农民被迫将其生产品的绝大部分交给地主作为租金或贡物，并给地主作一部分无偿劳役。只有到了资本主义社会，资产阶级用“等价交换”方式，购买雇佣工人的劳动力，为他们生产剩余价值。剥削剩余价值——这是资产阶级“不劳而获”的秘密。这个秘密，是由马克思揭开的。可见：把由于私有制度产生的现象和社会的分配原则混淆起来，是不妥当的。
    从法权观点看，按劳分配办法是贯彻了资产阶级法权的“平等”的原则的
    资产阶级是用剥削雇佣工人的剩余价值的办法来发财致富的。但是，大家知道，生产剩余价值的剩余劳动和生产雇佣工人家庭生活需用物资即劳动力的价值的必要劳动是混和在一起的。所以，就资本家与工人的直接关系来说，他们付给这个工人或那个工人多少工资，原则上则是以工人的劳动为尺度，即“做多少活，给多少钱”，或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给。这一点反映在法权上，就是资产阶级所说的平等。反过来，如果以法权观点来看，这种“按劳分配”的办法是贯彻了资产阶级法权的“平等”原则的。因此，我们说这种分配原则是资产阶级法权。所以这样说，是为了区别于历史上有过的别的法权即奴隶社会的法权和封建社会的法权的。
    在共产主义的初级阶段即社会主义社会，我们采取了“按劳分配”的原则。社会主义社会是没有剥削的社会，这是与资本主义社会根本不同的。这个社会所以和资本主义社会根本不同，不在于“按劳分配”本身，而在于社会制度中最根本的东西即所有制的改变。我们取消了生产资料的私有制，因而使社会生产的领导者和分配的主持者不再是资产阶级而是人民国家（全民所有制）或某个劳动者的集团（集体所有制）。在这里，劳动人民直接取得的报酬对其“劳动所得”即劳动所生产的产品来说，也不是“不折不扣”的，但是所有的“折扣”，并不是归任何私人所有，而是以国家利润或公共积累等形式，归全民所有或集体所有，这些“折扣”，都转回来直接或间接地为这个社会的成员谋福利。在这种条件下，“按劳分配”的原则和实践的矛盾消除了，就不再是剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的方式（资本主义剥削），而成为在劳动人民中进行分配的主要原则了。
    可见，在社会主义社会，人们所说的分配方式的革命也好，使资产阶级不得不进行劳动来养活自己，迫使他们进行改造也好，使“按劳分配”原则和实践不再矛盾，能够体现无产阶级意志也好，都不是因为“按劳分配”本身的因素，而是因为生产资料所有制这个最根本的东西的改变。
    因此，马克思反对那种把分配看作事物本质的观点。他说：“把所谓分配（按指分配原则——作者）看作事物的本质并把重点放在它上面，是根本错误的。”他进而阐述道：“消费品的任何一种分配（按指社会成员占有消费品的状况——作者），始终总不过是生产条件本身分配的后果。”（见“哥达纲领批判”）
    和按劳分配相对立的是按需分配，因此，不能说按劳分配是资本主义分配原则的否定或资产阶级法权的否定
    人们往往说“按劳分配”是和资本主义的分配原则相对立的。这样的说法，不能说在概念上是清晰的。其实，和“按劳分配”相对立的，是“按需分配”。原来，资本主义和共产主义这两个对立的社会之所以对立，主要的表现在生产资料所有制和社会的分配原则上。一个是生产资料私有制，另一个是生产资料公有制；一个是以人们的劳动为尺度来进行分配，另一个是按人们的需要来进行分配。当然生产资料所有制是最根本的东西，没有生产资料所有制的改变即由私有制改变为公有制，也就不会有分配原则的改变即由“按劳分配”改变为“按需分配”。但这种分配原则的改变，除了必需有所有制的改变外，还需要有其他一些条件，其中主要的是产品的极大的丰富和人们的思想觉悟、道德品质极大的提高。取消私有制虽然是最根本的，但却是比较容易做到的，只要无产阶级和人民大众革命成功，建立了无产阶级专政的政权，这个问题就不难解决了。而使产品极大的丰富和人们的思想觉悟、道德品质极大的提高，却不是一朝一夕的事。它是不能够与取消私有制同时奏功的。于是在达到共产主义社会之前，社会就会出现，也必需有这样一个阶段：一方面取消了生产资料的私人所有制即资产阶级法权中最根本的东西；另一方面则在主要的分配原则上保留了资产阶级法权中以劳动为尺度的“平等”原则即“按劳分配”。取消了生产资料的私人所有制，就使这个社会区别于和它根本不同体系的资本主义社会；在分配的主要原则上保留了“按劳分配”，又使这个社会区别于与它属于同一范畴、只是处于不同阶段的共产主义社会。这个社会，便是我们的社会主义社会。社会主义社会的这种状况，正是说明它虽然已经根本不同于资本主义社会，然而却不是我们所要建立的终极的社会，只是一个过渡的社会。
    由此可见，不能说“按劳分配”是资本主义分配原则的否定，或资产阶级法权的否定。如果那样说是对的，那末，到了共产主义阶段实行“按需分配”的分配原则时，便是资本主义分配原则或资产阶级法权的否定的否定了，而这样说，显然是不妥当的。
    “按劳分配”是资产阶级法权的这种说法，本来是出自马克思和列宁。反对有些人全面否定“按劳分配”是对的，但不应该因为反对那种错误的主张，便说“按劳分配”不是资产阶级法权。关于资产阶级法权和资产阶级式的法权，则只是文字上的差别，本义是没有什么差别的。因为不论怎么说，都是就其本源来说的，并不是指在社会主义社会的“按劳分配”，还代表什么资产阶级的利益。至于说“按劳分配”是资产阶级法权，当然不是说资产阶级法权只是“按劳分配”。这正如说人是动物并不等于说动物只是人一样，是逻辑上的特称肯定，本是无需解释的。
    不应该任意颠倒引用列宁的原话，得出与列宁本意相反的结论，列宁肯定了按劳分配的原则是资产阶级法权
    这里举出一个错误的引用经典作者的文字的例子，举出这个例子同时对于说明这个问题也是有好处的。在吴定求同志的“要全面估价‘按劳取酬’”（见1958年11月19日人民日报）的文章中，有这样一段：
    “由此可以得出结论，按劳取酬使‘不劳动者不得食’这一社会主义原则已经实现了，‘按等量劳动领得等量产品’这一社会主义原则也已经实现了”（列宁：国家与革命第118页）。在这里，比起极端不平等的资产阶级法权来是平等得多了。在这里，“资产阶级式的法权，是不复存在的了。”（列宁语）
    这段话的意思应该怎样理解呢？很明显：实现了“按劳分配”，“资产阶级式的法权不复存在的了。”而列宁的这段话却是这样讲的：
    因此，在共产主义社会第一阶段（普通称为社会主义的阶段）中，资产阶级式的法权还没有完全取消，而只是局部取消，只是在已经达到的经济改革的范围内，即只是在对于生产资料的关系上取消。资产阶级式的法权承认生产资料是某些个人的私有财产。社会主义将其变为公共财产。在这个限度内——且只有在这个限度内——资产阶级式的法权是不复存在了。
    但是，它在其另一部分中却依然存在，它依然是社会各成员间分配产品和分配劳动的调节者（决定者）。“不劳动者不得食”这一社会主义原则已经实现了；“按等量劳动得到等量产品”这一社会主义原则，也已经实现了。然而，这还不是共产主义，这还没有消除认许不相等人们按不等量的（事实上不等的）劳动领取等量产品的那种“资产阶级式的法权”。（见国家与革命）
    列宁这段文字非常明白：在社会主义社会，只在把私有财产变为公有财产的限度内，“资产阶级式的法权”不复存在了。在社会成员间分配产品和分配劳动中（按：即指实行“按劳分配”的原则——作者）资产阶级的法权“却依然存在”。为什么把列宁的文字任意前后颠倒、互相配合而作出与列宁的原意完全相反的结论来呢？吴定求同志虽然在后面又说过“按劳取酬包含着资产阶级法权的残余”等等含混不清的话，但在这一段中颠倒了列宁的意思，我认为就不是进行理论工作所应采取的态度。
    按劳分配不是社会主义分配的唯一的形式，劳保福利制度以及农村中实行供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度，就突破了按劳分配的范围至于全盘否定在现阶段采用“按劳分配”的必要性的所以错误，许多文章已经谈到了。根本的问题是这样的主张脱离了唯物主义。社会主义社会主要采取“按劳分配”的分配原则，是由社会发展状况所决定的。它虽然在本源上是资产阶级法权，但是在这一个阶段，采用它，对于社会生产有利，因而就成为社会主义社会的主要的分配原则。因为分配原则主要应服从生产状况。生产的具体状况，是社会的物质存在，是经济基础。分配的原则，是由人们决定的分配产品的依据，属于上层建筑。主观意志与客观实际，上层建筑与经济基础必须适应。然后才能反过头来，影响客观实际，促进经济基础的发展。在产品没有极大丰富以前，全盘否定“按劳分配”的分配原则，不只不能促进生产的发展，而且会使社会生产的一些环节失掉调节，在社会上造成某种混乱，对于发展生产不是有利的。
    当然，在社会主义社会中，只是主要的实行“按劳分配”，并不是唯一地实行“按劳分配”。在我国，大家知道，除了主要的按人们劳动的数量和质量发给一定量的工资以外，一开始对工人就有劳保福利制度。这劳保福利自然也是属于社会分配的一个方面，而这一部分却已经突破了“按劳分配”。在生产发展以后，许多农村又实行了部分供给、部分工资的分配制度。这供给的部分，更明显地突破了“按劳取酬”。固然，这是共产主义因素，但毕竟是在社会主义阶段实行的。而这种情况，是符合于辩证规律的。因为既然“按劳分配”和“按需分配”是对立的，那末，在实行按劳取酬的社会主义社会，存在着它的对立面“按需分配”的因素，是正常的。只是这时矛盾的主要方面，不能不是“按劳取酬”。以后，随着社会的发展，这矛盾的两个方面，循着相反的方向发展，即逐步增加“按需”的方面，逐渐消除“按劳”的方面（指总的趋势，非指一个时期之具体措施）。最后，经过多少时日“按劳”的方面消除了，我们的社会便进入共产主义时代。因此认为“按劳取酬”是社会主义社会唯一的分配原则，也是不确切的。因为那样便会把“按劳取酬”在社会主义社会的地位凝固化，而忽视了社会主义到共产主义的发展趋势。
    “按劳取酬”最后是要被否定的。但是在现在全盘否定它，为时却未免有点过早了！
