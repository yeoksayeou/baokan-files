Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 10th: The Baoquan People's Commune in Yian County, Heilongjiang Province, has undergone significant changes by implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture.

The Baoquan People's Commune in Yian County was previously a purely agricultural area, with only one iron and woodworking handicraft cooperative and one tailor shop, totaling twenty-one artisans. Since the establishment of the People's Commune and the implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, within just three months, the entire commune has established six hundred and nine factories of various sizes. Among them, there are five hundred and two factories serving agricultural production, including agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair plants, iron factories, cement plants, potassium triphosphate plants, and peat oil refineries. Additionally, there are one hundred and seven factories serving the needs of commune members' lives, such as grain and food processing plants, clothing factories, shoe factories, and knitting factories.

The emergence of these factories has brought about significant changes in the Baoquan Commune. In the past, even a single screw had to be purchased from the county town forty-five li away. When agricultural machinery broke down, it was even more necessary to go to the city for repairs, which was both time-consuming and costly. Since the establishment of the machinery manufacturing and repair plant in the autumn of 1958, it has not only undertaken the major and medium repairs of the commune's three tractors but also the major and medium repairs of three tractors from the central People's Commune of the county. It has also manufactured more than two thousand four hundred pieces of equipment for plowing and water conservancy projects, such as rope-drawn tillers, pickaxes, shovels, and axles, and repaired more than one thousand large and small farm tools. At the same time, it has also produced many daily necessities. The commune's food factory, in just two or three months, produced two hundred and fifty-one thousand jin of maltose, pastries, white wine, starch, etc., accumulating considerable funds for expanded reproduction. Due to the mechanization of rice milling, straw cutting, feed crushing, and flour milling, fifteen thousand man-days and two hundred and eighty-five thousand horse-days have also been saved.

Due to the development of industry, this commune now has five hundred and thirty-one people (accounting for 5% of the commune's male and female labor force) engaged in industrial production; nine hundred and nineteen people are engaged in both industry and agriculture (agriculture during busy farming seasons, industry during slack seasons), accounting for 9.5% of the labor force. After learning by doing, most of these people are now familiar with industrial production in their respective fields.

The achievements of the Baoquan People's Commune in running industries are obtained under the leadership of the Party committee, relying on the masses to overcome difficulties in five aspects: factory buildings, equipment, technology, labor, and raw materials. First, the commune did not build clubs or new offices, but only built a factory building of six hundred and forty square meters. This still did not meet the requirements, so the commune leaders discussed it with the masses. After holding various discussion meetings and conducting publicity and education, the masses voluntarily adjusted some houses that could be adjusted as factory buildings.

Secondly, in solving the equipment problem, a relatively well-equipped machinery manufacturing and repair plant was first established. It had two foreign lathes, two local lathes, one wood lathe, as well as taps, dies, and drills. In addition, the equipment of other factories was mostly solved by the masses through self-reliance.

Thirdly, in solving the problem of talent, the commune adopted the methods of "finding, learning, bringing, and delving." After selection and the masses' voluntary registration, one hundred and thirty talents from all walks of life were found, including transferred automobile drivers, tank soldiers, as well as ironworkers, carpenters, shoemakers, and workers who repair clocks and engrave. The commune leaders organized these people as the backbone for running industry. In addition, people were sent out to learn technology, or some experts were invited in to impart technology.

Fourthly, in solving the labor problem, a unified arrangement method was adopted. Heavy labor or high-intensity work, such as digging peat, was done by taking advantage of agricultural slack seasons for short-term assaults; lighter and more dispersed work was organized for women, primary school students, and the elderly; and complex production technologies were handled by senior primary school graduates, junior high school graduates, and young and strong young men.

Fifthly, regarding the raw material problem, the commune leaders, based on the fact that the commune had a lot of scrap steel, launched a mass movement to dig up scrap iron among the commune members. Within just a few days, the commune members dug up fifty-six tons of scrap steel. This first solved the difficulty of insufficient steel raw materials, and secondly, it made full use of the surplus agricultural and sideline products in the countryside as raw materials, such as frozen potatoes and frozen horned melons. The commune established fifty-four places such as starch factories and sugar factories, all using these raw materials.

    宝泉人民公社贯彻工农业并举方针
    突破五道难关办起六百工厂
    据新华社哈尔滨10日电　黑龙江省依安县宝泉人民公社贯彻工农业并举的方针，使公社面貌起了很大变化。
    依安县宝泉人民公社，过去是一个纯农业区，只有一个铁木手工业社和一个成衣铺，二十一个手工业者。自从建立人民公社和贯彻了工农业并举的方针之后，仅三个月的工夫，全社办起大小工厂六百零九个，其中有为农业生产服务的农业机械制造修配厂、铁工厂、水泥厂、三钾厂、草炭炼油厂等五百零二个，还有为社员生活服务的粮食和食品加工厂、被服厂、制鞋厂、针织厂等共一百零七个。
    这些工厂的诞生，使宝泉公社的面貌发生了很大的变化。往年，这个地方就连配个螺丝钉都得到四十五里以外的县城去买，农业机械发生故障时，更需要进城才能修理，既误工又费钱。自从1958年秋天建立起机械制造修配厂，不仅承担了公社的三台拖拉机大、中修任务；还承担了县的中心人民公社三台拖拉机大、中修任务；制造了翻地、水利工程使用的七百台绳索牵引机、洋镐、铁锹、车轴等二千四百多件，修理大小农具一千多件；同时还生产了许多生活日用品。公社的食品工厂仅仅两三个月的时间，就生产出糖稀、糕点、白酒、淀粉等二十五万一千斤，为扩大再生产积累了不少资金。由于制米、铡草、饲料粉碎、磨面的机械化，还节省了一万五千个人工和二十八万五千个马工。
    这个公社由于工业的发展，现在有五百三十一人（占全社男女劳力5％）走向了工业生产；有九百一十九人亦工亦农（农忙搞农业，农闲搞工业），占劳动力的9.5％。这些人经过边学边做，现在大部分都熟悉了本行的工业生产。
    宝泉人民公社社办工业的成绩，是在党委的领导下，依靠群众克服了厂房、设备、技术、劳力、原料等五个方面的困难以后获得的。首先，公社没修俱乐部和新办公室，只是盖了一个六百四十平方公尺的厂房。这样还满足不了要求，公社领导上又和群众商量。经过召开各种座谈会和宣传教育，群众自动调剂了一些可以调剂出来的房子作厂房。
    其次，在解决设备问题上，先办了一个设备比较完善的机械制造修配厂。其中有洋车床二台，土车床二台，木旋床一台，还有丝锥、板牙、摇钻等工具。除此之外，其它工厂的设备绝大部分都是群众用自力更生的办法解决的。
    第三，在解决人材问题上，这个社采取了“找、学、带、钻”的方法。经过选拔和群众自觉地报名，找到各方面人材一百三十人，其中有转业的汽车司机、坦克手，也有铁工、木工、鞋匠，还有修理钟表和刻字的工人。社领导上把这些人组织起来做为办工业的骨干。另外还派人出去学习技术，或请进来一些内行的人传授技术。
    第四，在解决劳力问题上，采取了统一安排的方法，笨重的劳动或强度高的活，如挖草炭等，都是钻农业空子（农闲）搞小段突击；较轻便又比较分散的活，就组织妇女、小学生和老年人去做；生产技术复杂的，由高小毕业生、初中毕业生和年青力壮的小伙子去做。
    第五，关于原料问题，社领导上根据本社有许多废钢铁的情况，发动社员们开展了挖掘废铁的群众性运动，仅几天之内，社员们就挖掘出废钢铁五十六吨。首先解决了钢铁原料不足的困难，其次是充分利用农村剩余农副产品作原料，如冻土豆、冻角瓜等。社里建立了淀粉厂、糖厂等五十四处，都是利用这些原料。
