Editorial Notes:

    After the fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched, Shaanxi raised a question in its fertilizer accumulation work: making fertilizer quality an important item in setting responsibility systems. Improving fertilizer quality can meet the nutritional needs of crops and save a lot of transportation resources. It is truly a win-win situation.

    Now that the masses have been mobilized, and fertilizer accumulation and production have become a campaign, the quantity of fertilizer will rapidly increase. At this critical juncture, it is very necessary and appropriate to propose attention to fertilizer quality.

    积肥运动开展以后
    陕西在积肥工作中提出了一个问题，就是：在规定责任制上把肥料质量做为一个重要项目。提高肥料质量，可以满足作物的营养需要；还可以节省大量的运输力，真是一举数得。
    在群众发动起来，积肥、制肥形成运动以后，肥料的数量就会迅速地增长，在这个节骨眼，提出注意肥料质量是十分必要而又恰合时宜的。
