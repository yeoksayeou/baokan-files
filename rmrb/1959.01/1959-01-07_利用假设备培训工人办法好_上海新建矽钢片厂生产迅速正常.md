    Good Method of Using Dummy Equipment to Train Workers; Shanghai's Newly Built Silicon Steel Sheet Factory Achieves Rapid and Normal Production
    (Our dispatch) Because the Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory did a good job of production preparation work, such as using dummy equipment to train production workers in advance, it took only nine months from the start of construction to putting it into production; within three months of starting production, it reached and exceeded the designed production level, and the product quality was very good.
    As early as after the factory construction plan was determined, the Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory, while successively starting production preparation work, created a very effective new method in terms of production personnel training, that is, adopting the method of internship operation on dummy equipment. More than 90% of the new workers in the factory were transferred from light industrial departments and small steel rolling mills. How to produce silicon steel sheets was something many people had never seen before. Faced with this situation, the factory mobilized the masses of employees to discuss how to train new workers more, faster, better, and more economically. With the support and sponsorship of the factory's Party organization, the factory made three dummy rolling mills and two sets of dummy heating furnaces, and used these dummy equipment to quickly train new rolling workers. This kind of dummy rolling mill is made by using two large pieces of wood to make arches, and using two diesel drums as rollers. The operation method of this kind of dummy rolling mill is very simple. It only took three or four months to train hundreds of workers who skillfully mastered the operation technology of silicon steel sheet production. Now, this factory has also used this method to train about 300 workers for other fraternal factories, some of whom have already returned to their factories for production.

    利用假设备培训工人办法好
    上海新建矽钢片厂生产迅速正常
    本报讯　上海矽钢片厂由于事先用假设备培训生产工人等生产准备工作做得好，从开始筹建到投入生产仅仅用了九个多月时间；投入生产后三个月就达到和超过了设计生产水平，而且产品质量很好。
    早在建厂方案确定之后，上海矽钢片工厂在陆续开始进行生产准备工作中，在生产人员培训工作方面，创造了一个十分有效的新方法，即采用在假设备上实习操作的方法。该厂新进厂的工人，有90％以上是从轻工业部门和小型轧钢厂调来的，怎样生产矽钢片许多人看都没有看见过。面对这种情况，该厂发动职工群众讨论如何才能多快好省地培训新工人。在工厂党组织的支持和赞助下，厂内制作了三台假轧钢机和二组假加热炉，利用这些假设备，快速培训新的轧钢工人。这种假轧机，是用两块较大的木头做牌坊，用两个柴油桶做轧辊做成的。这种假轧机，操作方法很简单，只花了三、四个月的时间，就培训出了好几百名工人，熟练地掌握了矽钢片生产的操作技术。现在，这个工厂又用这种办法给其他几个兄弟工厂培养了约三百名工人，其中有的已经回厂生产。
