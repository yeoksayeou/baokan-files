　　The Power of Contrast

　　Through contrast, people can distinguish between good and bad, right and wrong, and so on. Contrast is a good method for people to correctly understand objective things. The working people, who were subjected to bullying in the old society, can raise their class consciousness and recognize the direction of their struggle through recalling their suffering. Liu Jiemei in Hubei, through comparing the past and present, was able to turn back from forgetting her roots. All this illustrates the power of contrast.

　　The superiority of the people's commune is an ironclad fact. How can we make people more deeply aware of this fact? The column "Commune Members Praise the Commune" published in today's newspaper provides us with a method: contrast, look more at today, and think more about the past. Recalling the past can make us more clearly aware of the present, increase our love for the new society and new things, and increase our confidence and strength in running the commune well and striving for a greater harvest this year.

    对比的威力
    通过对比，人们可以分出好坏，可以认清是非，可以……。对比是使人正确地认识客观事物的一种好方法。曾在旧社会里备受欺凌的劳动人民，经过回忆诉苦，能够提高阶级觉悟，认清奋斗方向，湖北刘介梅经过对比今昔，能够由忘本而回头，这都说明了对比的威力。
    人民公社的优越性是铁的事实。怎样才能使人更深刻的认识这一事实呢？今天本报发表的专栏——“社员夸公社”为我们提供了一个方法：对比，多看看今天，多想想过去。回忆过去就能更清楚地认识现在，就能增加对新社会和新事物的热爱，就能使我们增加办好公社和争取今年更大丰收的信心和力量。
