According to a report in Shandong's Dazhong Daily, under the guidance of the thought of "being both active and reliable" and "ten-point targets, twelve-point measures," the Dezhou Machine Tool Factory has initially formulated its production plan for the first quarter of this year. The realization of this plan will lead to significant improvements in total output value and the output of major products compared to the same period last year.

Before formulating the first-quarter plan, this factory summarized its production experience from last year. Last year, due to the resolute implementation of the principles of "taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward," centralized leadership and launching mass movements on a large scale, and walking on two legs, production saw an unprecedented leap forward. Subsequently, the factory's Party committee organized cadres at the middle level and above to study the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, clarifying that the key to formulating a good plan must be to have both ardent revolutionary enthusiasm and a spirit of calm scientific analysis; to have both active and advanced indicators and practical and reliable measures, and to fully utilize the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward. At the same time, the Party committee organized administrative management personnel to repeatedly rank the key production aspects, analyzing the difficulties and contradictions in the execution of the plan. Through analysis and ranking, this year's production characteristics are: large tasks, shortage of skilled workers, insufficient equipment, material difficulties, and an increase in new workers, while raw materials, equipment, and technology are three prominent key factors in the execution of the plan. In terms of raw materials, in addition to the lathes processed for the central government, where most of the raw materials are supplied by the state, the steel materials used to produce machine tools to arm themselves, as well as some of the bearings, cement, coke, and other materials necessary for the production of lathes, must be solved by themselves. According to this year's production needs, more than 140 various machine tools need to be added, and some of the original equipment and tools still need to be改造 (gaizao - transform). To adapt to this year's increased machine tool production and training needs, a large number of new workers need to be added in major workshops such as foundry, processing, tool repair, and assembly this year, which requires accelerating the training of technical personnel.

Targeting the main key issues, they fully mobilized the masses and separately studied and proposed concrete measures and methods to solve the difficulties. In terms of raw materials, in addition to the portion supplied by the state, the main solutions are: First, mobilizing the enthusiasm of supply and marketing personnel. Since mid-December of last year, the factory has organized supply and marketing personnel to strengthen connections with Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places, urging relevant steel plants to execute supply contracts, and more than 130 tons of steel have now been resolved. Second, doing a good job in preparing the iron-smelting furnace for production, leveraging its smelting efficiency, and smelting at least 250 tons of pig iron per month to meet production needs. Third, strengthening cooperation with nearby people's communes. Two communes are now producing wooden boxes for this factory and supplying reed mats necessary for packaging machine tools, while also supporting the communes' industry with technology, tools, and raw materials. Fourth, relying on self-reliance to solve the difficulties of raw materials such as bearings and cement. A special workshop for manufacturing bearings has now been established in the factory, planning to produce 12,000 sets of bearings in the first quarter; a locally-made cement production workshop has also been built, planning to produce 180 tons of 400-grade high-grade cement in the first quarter.

More than 140 various machine tools need to be added this year. In addition to the 58 simple machine tools they produced in December of last year, the remaining 80 or more machine tools need to be manufactured in the first quarter of this year. To this end, they decided to continue to implement the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods," and engage in large-scale large and medium-sized simple machine tools, achieve self-armament, and expand equipment capacity. The factory has only one gear hobbing machine for producing gears, and its production capacity is very low. In order to increase hobbing equipment, they used the original hobbing machine as a drawing and used waste materials to make two simple hobbing machines. In the manufacture of simple machine tools, they attached great importance to the use of waste products and waste materials. The more than 50 simple machine tools that have been made do not have cement-made bases, so they used wood instead.

In order to solve the key problem of insufficient technical strength, they equipped several major workshops with apprentices according to needs and possibilities. In the training, each workshop grasped rapid, professional training methods according to different characteristics. The processing workshop adopted the method of signing master-apprentice contracts; the assembly workshop adopted the method of technical workers leading trainees and old trainees leading new trainees; the foundry workshop formed more than 30 new trainees into two training groups, with old technical workers imparting technology. These measures laid a reliable material and technical foundation for completing and overfulfilling the first quarter's plan.

    轰轰烈烈　扎扎实实
    德州机床厂定跃进计划抓具体措施
    据山东大众日报消息　德州机床厂在“既积极又可靠”和“十分指标、十二分措施”的思想指导下，初步订出了今年第一季度生产计划。实现这个计划，比去年同期总产值和主要产品产量都有极大提高。
    这个厂在制订第一季度计划前，总结了去年的生产经验。在去年，由于坚决贯彻了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”、集中领导与大搞群众运动、用两条腿走路的方针，生产出现了史无前例的跃进。接着厂的党委组织中层以上干部学习了党的八届六中全会决议，明确了制订好计划的关键必须既要有炽热的革命热情，又要有冷静的科学分析的精神；既要有积极先进的指标，又要有切实可靠的措施，并充分运用去年大跃进中的丰富经验。同时，党委组织行政管理有关人员反复进行了生产关键排队，分析执行计划中的困难和矛盾。经过分析、排队，今年的生产特点是：任务大、技工缺、设备不足、材料困难、新工人增多，而原料、设备、技术又是执行计划中的三个突出关键。原料方面，除为中央加工的车床，大部分原料由国家供应外，自己生产机床武装自己所用的钢铁材料和生产车床必需的部分轴承、水泥、焦炭等材料都必须自己来解决；根据今年的生产，需要增加各种机床一百四十多台，部分原有设备和工具尚需要改造；适应今年机床增产和培训需要，在铸工、加工、工修、装配等主要车间，今年需要增加大量新工人，这样就必须加速技术力量的培训工作。
    他们针对主要的关键问题，充分发动群众，分别研究和提出了解决困难的具体措施和办法。在原料上，除国家供给的部分原料外，主要解决的办法是：第一，调动供销人员的积极性，从去年12月中旬以来，厂里组织供销人员到武汉、上海等地加强联系，督促有关钢铁厂执行供应合同，现在已解决钢材一百三十多吨。第二，做好炼铁炉的生产准备工作，发挥炼铁炉的熔炼效能，每月至少可炼出生铁二百五十吨，供应生产需要。第三，加强与附近人民公社协作，现在已有两个公社为这个厂生产木箱和供应包装机床所必需的苇席，同时在技术、工具和原料等方面支援公社的工业。第四，自力更生解决轴承、水泥等原材料的困难。现在厂里专门成立了一个制造轴承的工段，计划在第一季度生产轴承一万二千套；还建起了土制水泥生产车间，计划在第一季度生产四百号高标号水泥一百八十吨。
    今年需要增加的各种机床一百四十多台，除去年12月份他们已生产出五十八台简易机床外，余下的八十多部机床，需要在今年第一季度制成。为此，他们决定继续贯彻“土洋结合”的方针，大搞大、中型简易机床，实现自我武装，扩大设备能力。厂里生产齿轮的滚齿机只有一台，生产能力很低，需要增加滚齿设备，他们就以原有滚齿机为图样，利用废料制成了两部简易滚齿机。在制造简易机床中，他们十分重视利用废品废料，已制成的五十多部机床没有水泥制造机座，他们就用木头代替。
    为了解决技术力量不足这个关键，他们根据需要和可能，为几个主要车间配齐了学徒工。在培训中，各车间都根据不同的特点，掌握了快速、专业的培训方法。加工车间采取了签订师徒合同的办法；装配车间采取技术工人带学员、老学员带新学员的方法；铸工车间将三十多个新学员组成两个培训小组，由老技术工人传授技术。这些措施，为完成和超额完成第一季度计划奠定可靠的物质和技术基础。
