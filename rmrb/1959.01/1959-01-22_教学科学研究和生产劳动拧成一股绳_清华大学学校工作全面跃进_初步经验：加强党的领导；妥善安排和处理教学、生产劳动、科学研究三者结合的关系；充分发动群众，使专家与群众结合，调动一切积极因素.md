Integrate Teaching, Scientific Research, and Productive Labor:
Tsinghua University Achieves Overall Advancement in School Work
Preliminary Experiences: Strengthen Party Leadership; Appropriately Arrange and Handle the Integration of Teaching, Productive Labor, and Scientific Research; Fully Mobilize the Masses, Combine Experts with the Masses, and Mobilize All Positive Factors

(Our Dispatch) Tsinghua University, in implementing the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" over the past year, is undergoing unprecedented and profound changes throughout the school. This year, the school introduced productive labor into the teaching process, gradually integrating teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, further combining politics and technology, theory and practice, manual labor and mental labor, experts and the masses, and school and society. As a result, the school's work has seen an overall leap forward. Preliminary experiences from Tsinghua University's practice over the past year show that to effectively implement the Party's education policy, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's overall leadership of school work, especially the political and ideological leadership of all teachers, students, and staff; the integration of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research should be grasped and handled appropriately; and the masses should be fully mobilized, combining experts with the masses, to mobilize all positive factors.

Tsinghua University is a multi-disciplinary higher industrial school. Here, remnants of the old tradition of so-called "supra-politics" have long existed, and some people are still infatuated with the direction of bourgeois experts. Therefore, correctly resolving the relationship between technology and politics is of utmost importance. The Party organization of Tsinghua University, on the basis of winning the anti-Rightist struggle, organized a great debate on the two roads of scientific research work, a great debate on teaching, and a great debate on "redness and expertise" throughout the school. These debates exposed various bourgeois individualist ideas and bourgeois educational viewpoints on the school's front, and people's directions began to be clarified, which paved the way for the implementation of the Party's education policy.

Starting in the spring of last year, the Party organization of Tsinghua University, based on the Party's policy, launched a work-study movement among students. After the summer, it more firmly led the entire school to introduce productive labor into the teaching process. Within the school, not everyone agreed with vigorously engaging in production and running factories on a large scale. The Party organization consistently persisted in struggling against ideological tendencies that opposed or doubted the Party's education policy and advocated that teaching should be divorced from production and theory should be divorced from practice; at the same time, it also promptly paid attention to preventing and correcting one-sided production viewpoints that neglected to combine productive labor well with teaching and scientific research. The Party organization paid attention to teaching as the primary focus and made appropriate and comprehensive arrangements for teaching, productive labor, scientific research, as well as sports, mass cultural activities, and other tasks. The principle of the arrangement was to both strengthen students' productive labor training and improve their level of theoretical study.

It is worth special mentioning that the Party organization of Tsinghua University earnestly implemented the spirit of the Party's general line for building socialism and the Party's industrial policies in all aspects of school work, such as teaching, production, and scientific research, fully embodying the principle of close integration of politics and technology and education serving proletarian politics in school work. For example, many majors have added or expanded introductory courses, focusing on the Party's policies related to the major, the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward, and the creative inventions of the masses. The content of many courses has also been appropriately modified and developed in accordance with the spirit of the general line, combining general technical theory with China's reality, overcoming the shortcomings of mechanically copying foreign experiences in the past. In curriculum design, graduation design, production, and scientific research, topics of great significance and urgent need for the national economy are selected to serve the three "marshals" and two "pioneers," adopting the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. A series of scientific research centered on nodular cast iron completed by the school last year, as well as indigenous power plants convenient for promotion in people's communes, and miniature cars convenient for solving current urban traffic problems, are all products under the guidance of this ideology. Doing so not only enables the school's work to receive social support and assistance, but more importantly, it enables the people cultivated by the school to stand at the forefront of socialist construction.

This year, the Party organization of Tsinghua University adopted the method of combining "situation education" that coordinated with the domestic Great Leap Forward situation and mass movements when conducting political and ideological work. After publicizing the Party's general line for building socialism, it then launched a factory-building movement; after publicizing the Party's education policy, it launched a new teaching reform movement; and in coordination with the national people's commune movement, it carried out "socialism and communism education." At the same time, the Party organization led the masses to adopt the method of constantly making the implicit explicit in various tasks, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command. The Party organization used these lively and vivid political and ideological works to deliver the Party's policies to the masses, becoming a guide for action. In this way, a situation of politics commanding professional work appeared in all aspects of the school's work.

The practice of Tsinghua University shows that the central issue in implementing the Party's education policy under the current circumstances lies in combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research well. The better the three are combined, the further the principle of linking theory with practice in education is embodied, the more quickly the teaching quality can be improved and scientific research promoted, and the more fully students can develop in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects. The results of Tsinghua University's combination of graduation design and curriculum design with national production tasks in some classes show that doing so is the most practical and effective way to cultivate and improve students' independent working ability and to train future industrial construction cadres. Tsinghua University used the method of combining production practice to conduct the teaching of technical courses. They generally adopted two methods: teaching and productive labor intersecting and classroom teaching combined with on-site teaching, both of which achieved good results. When a class in the automotive major of the Power Department was studying the theory of automobile structure, they first studied a period of theory and then went to the automobile repair factory to participate in productive labor. Not only did they understand the structure of the automobile clearly, but they could also repair and assemble it, and with the help of experienced workers, they wrote a "Automobile Repair Studies." After teaching is combined with productive labor, students can test and apply the theories they have learned, and they also have the opportunity to come into contact with various complex problems in production. Some of these problems cannot be solved only with or cannot be solved immediately with the theories they have learned or the theories they already have. This forces teachers to conduct in-depth research based on actual engineering conditions, thereby further promoting the technical theory related to a certain production and applying it to practice. Facts have proved that through production practice, the teaching content can be continuously enriched and updated, and the development of engineering technology theory can be promoted. Scientific research activities can also be vigorously carried out because they have a good material condition of a production base and can continuously obtain new and valuable research topics from production practice. Of course, production activities under the guidance of theory and combined with scientific research will inevitably continue to produce new leap forwards. Therefore, the good combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research can achieve complementary effects, thereby promoting a qualitative leap in school work.

However, combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research well, especially completely integrating theoretical teaching and productive labor into a complete teaching process in accordance with the school's goal of cultivating talents, is a very complicated matter. There is both unity and contradiction between teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. If not handled well, the desired results cannot be achieved. The practice of Tsinghua University shows that whether the relationship between the three can be handled well depends on whether the teaching, productive labor, and scientific research can be comprehensively and properly organized and arranged in accordance with the school's requirements for cultivating talents, so as to collectively complete production and scientific research tasks and ensure that each student fully achieves the prescribed training goals. To do this, several issues need to be resolved. One is the arrangement of production labor and study time. Tsinghua University specifies the proportion of time spent on labor and study in accordance with the requirements of study, based on different grades and different majors. Roughly speaking, within the large framework of "one, three, eight," that is, one year, three months of labor, eight months of study, and one month of vacation. Such a proportion is suitable for the specific situation of Tsinghua University. Another is: the selection of production tasks should be well connected with the requirements of study. After productive labor is incorporated into the teaching process, theoretical teaching and productive labor form a complete teaching process. Therefore, production should be carried out in a planned and purposeful manner; the school's factory must be combined with the major, and production tasks must be selected according to the nature of the major and teaching requirements. Going to participate in productive labor outside the school should also strive to meet the teaching requirements. Of course, if certain productive labor is not combined with the major, but it is indeed necessary, students should also be organized to participate, but the amount should not be too much. Third, when arranging students' productive labor and scientific research work, it is necessary to follow the principle of being proficient in one and knowing many. In addition to enabling them to master a certain skill and reach a considerable level of proficiency, appropriate methods such as rotating types of work, collectively discussing production tasks, holding production meetings, and summarizing production experience should be adopted to enable students to master or understand the entire work. In particular, it is very necessary to conduct a collective summary based on learning requirements after completing a production task or scientific research task. The summary process is an important process of mutual exchange of experiences, learning from each other's strengths, and comprehensively cultivating students, and it is also a process of upgrading the knowledge gained in practice to theory.

After the implementation of the combination of teaching and productive labor, Tsinghua University has been relatively stable in mastering the problem of teaching basic theory courses. Although, there were also some teachers who locally emphasized that basic courses cannot be combined with majors, believing that combining with majors would weaken the teaching of systematic theory; at the same time, some people advocated abolishing certain basic theory courses, or disassembling them and distributing them to professional technical courses. The Party organization of Tsinghua University resolutely opposed these two one-sided viewpoints, pointing out the extremely important significance of basic theory courses in imparting general natural laws so that students have a broad foundation of theoretical knowledge, and in cultivating students' dialectical materialism worldview and ideological methods; at the same time, it pointed out the importance of combining basic theory courses with the practical needs of engineering majors for improving the teaching quality of basic theory courses. Over the past year, Tsinghua University has ensured the due class hours of basic theory courses, not only has it not weakened students in mastering systematic theory, but also, because it has further combined with engineering majors and linked with practice, the content taught is richer and more thorough than stipulated in the past teaching syllabus. Many basic theory course teachers have created some valuable teaching methods for improving the teaching quality of basic theory courses due to participating in professional productive labor and scientific research, and have found the correct way to enable certain basic theories to adapt to the needs of engineering practice and continuously improve.

Over the past year, Tsinghua University has implemented the mass line of combining teachers, students, and those who are capable under the leadership of the Party committee, fully playing the creativity and enthusiasm of the vast number of teachers, students, and staff, so that a magnificent mass movement has been rapidly launched in production, teaching, and scientific research. Tens of thousands of students and workers, together with teachers, have built various types of factories all over the school, dozens or hundreds of teachers, students, and workers have combined together to attack cutting-edge technologies; while the entire school's teachers and students are building factories on a large scale and attacking scientific frontiers, they have also launched a wide-ranging and profound teaching reform movement, making major reforms to the teaching plan, teaching syllabus, teaching content, and teaching methods. The Party organization of Tsinghua University firmly believes that the creativity of the masses is endless, constantly puts forward inspiring tasks based on the Party's policies, encourages and organizes the masses to practice, and promptly summarizes the experiences created by the masses in practice and then implements them. By doing so, the positive factors in all aspects of the school have been mobilized, and in a short period of more than half a year, the work that could not be completed in many years according to "routine" has been completed, and people have never thought that such amazing potential is contained within Tsinghua University!

In implementing the mass line, the Party organization of Tsinghua University resolutely criticized the view that opposed experts and the masses. It affirmed that after the implementation of the combination of education and productive labor, the leading role of teachers in teaching was not reduced but improved. And affirmed: To fully play the role of teachers, they must be combined with the broad masses. Every important achievement of Tsinghua University in teaching, production, and scientific research over the past year has been inseparable from this combination. Through such a combination, a new teacher-student relationship is growing. At the same time, Tsinghua University attaches great importance to the combination of workers, peasants, and the masses and all people with practical experience with teachers and students. They organize workers in the school to give lectures to students, invite model workers to the school to perform and give speeches, tutor and review graduation designs, and propose that students should take the world's capable people as teachers, send them to visit various technical innovation exhibitions on-site outside the school. In this way, they constantly absorb the rich experience of workers, peasants, and laborers and production experts inside and outside the school, so that the wisdom of the people constantly flows into the school, and promote the continuous improvement of teaching and scientific research quality.

    教学科学研究和生产劳动拧成一股绳
    清华大学学校工作全面跃进
    初步经验：加强党的领导；妥善安排和处理教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者结合的关系；充分发动群众，使专家与群众结合，调动一切积极因素
    本报讯　清华大学在过去一年中执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合”的方针，整个学校经历着空前的深刻的变化。这一年，学校把生产劳动引入了教学过程，逐步地使教学、科学研究和生产劳动拧成一股绳，使政治与技术、理论与实际、体力劳动与脑力劳动、专家与群众、学校与社会都进一步结合起来。这样，学校的工作出现了全面跃进的局面。一年来，清华大学从自己的实践中取得的初步经验表明：要很好地贯彻党的教育方针，必需加强党对学校工作的全面领导，特别是对全体师生员工的政治思想领导；应该抓住并妥善地安排和处理教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者的结合关系，要充分地发动群众，把专家与群众结合起来，以便调动一切积极因素。
    清华大学是一个多科性高等工业学校。在这里，长期存在过所谓“超政治”的旧传统的残余，也还有人迷恋资产阶级专家的方向。因此，正确地解决技术与政治的关系，有着极其重要的意义。清华大学的党组织在反右派斗争取得胜利的基础上，在全校组织了关于科学研究工作的两条道路的大辩论、教学大辩论、红专大辩论。这几次辩论揭露了学校阵地上形形色色的资产阶级个人主义思想和资产阶级教育观点，人们的方向开始明确了，这便为贯彻党的教育方针扫清了道路。
    清华大学的党组织从去年春天开始，即根据党的方针发动学生开展勤工俭学运动。夏季以后，更坚定地领导全校把生产劳动引入了教学过程。在学校内，并非所有的人都同意大搞生产、大办工厂。党组织始终坚持了同反对、怀疑党的教育方针，主张教学脱离生产、理论脱离实际的思想倾向作斗争；同时，也及时地注意防止及纠正了那种忽视把生产劳动很好地与教学、科学研究结合起来的片面的生产观点。党组织注意到以教学为主，把教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者以及体育、群众文化活动和其他各项工作，妥善地作全面安排。安排的原则是：既要加强学生的生产劳动的锻炼，又要提高学生的理论学习的水平。
    值得特别提出的是：清华大学的党组织，把党的建设社会主义的总路线的精神和党的关于工业的方针、政策，认真贯彻到教学、生产、科学研究等学校工作的各个方面，在学校工作中充分体现了政治与技术密切结合、教育为无产阶级的政治服务的原则。例如：许多专业都增设或扩大了概论课，着重讲述与专业有关的党的方针、大跃进中的成就与经验、群众的创造发明。许多课程的内容也根据总路线的精神，作了适当的修改和发展，使一般的技术理论与中国的实际结合，克服了过去那些机械搬用外国经验的缺点。在课程设计、毕业设计、生产和科学研究中，选择对国民经济有重大意义有迫切需要的课题，为三大“元帅”两个“先行”服务，采取“土洋结合”的办法，作到多、快、好、省。这个学校去年完成的以球墨铸铁为中心的一系列科学研究，和便于在人民公社推广的土电厂、便于解决目前城市交通问题的微型汽车等，都是这个思想指导下的产物。这样做，不仅使学校的工作得到了社会的支持、协助，更重要的是使学校培养出的人，能够站在社会主义建设的前面。
    这一年，清华大学的党组织进行政治思想工作时，采取了把配合国内大跃进形势的“形势教育”和群众运动结合起来的方法。在宣传党的建设社会主义总路线以后，接着就发动了建厂运动；在宣传党的教育方针后，就发动了新的教学改革运动；配合全国人民公社化运动，又进行了“社会主义和共产主义教育”。同时，党组织在各项工作中，领导群众采取不断务虚的方法，坚持政治挂帅。党组织用这些生动活泼的政治思想工作，把党的方针、政策交给了群众，成为指导行动的指南。这样，就在全校各项工作中出现了政治统帅业务的局面。
    清华大学的实践表明：在目前情况下贯彻党的教育方针的中心问题，在于把教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者很好地结合起来。三者结合得好，使教育工作中理论联系实际的原则得以进一步的体现，能够迅速提高教学质量和推动科学研究，可以使学生在德育、智育、体育三方面都得到充分的发展。清华大学一些班级的毕业设计和课程设计结合国家生产任务进行的结果表明：这样做是培养和提高学生独立工作能力，最切实最有效地锻炼未来的工业建设干部的正确手段。清华大学用结合生产实践的方法进行了技术课程的教学。他们普遍采取教学与生产劳动交叉进行和课堂教学与现场教学相结合的两种方式，都得到了很好的效果。动力系汽车专业有一个班学习汽车结构理论时，先学一段理论，再到汽车修理厂去参加生产劳动，不仅把汽车的结构弄得清清楚楚，还能动手修理装配，并在老师傅帮助下，写出了一本“汽车修理学”。教学结合生产劳动后，学生可以检验和运用他们学过的理论，也有机会接触到生产中各种复杂问题，其中有些问题不是只用或者不能立刻用已学的或已有的理论解决得了的，这就迫使教师根据工程实际情况去深入研究，从而把有关某一生产的技术理论推进一步，应用到实际中去。事实证明，通过生产实践可以使教学内容获得不断丰富和更新，并促进工程技术理论的发展。科学研究活动也因有了生产基地这一很好的物质条件，并能从生产实践中不断地得到新的有价值的研究课题，而得以蓬勃开展。当然，在理论指导下的以及与科学研究相结合的生产活动，也必然会不断出现新的跃进。所以，教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者的很好的结合，可以得到相辅相成的功效，从而促进学校工作发生质的飞跃。
    但是，要把教学、生产劳动、科学研究三者结合好，尤其是要按照学校培养人材的目标，把理论教学和生产劳动完全揉合在一个完整的教学过程内，却是一件十分复杂的事。教学、科学研究与生产劳动之间，是既有统一，也有矛盾的，处理不好，就不能达到预期的效果。清华大学的实践表明：能否把三者关系处理得好，关键在于能否按照学校培养人材的要求，把教学、生产劳动、科学研究作全面的妥善的组织和安排，做到既能集体完成生产和科学研究任务，又能保证每个学生全面达到规定的培养目标。这样做，有几个方面的问题需要解决。一是生产劳动与学习时间的安排。清华大学根据不同年级不同专业，按照学习的要求来具体规定劳动与学习各占时间的比例。大体上说，在“一三八”的大框框中，即一年三个月劳动，八个月学习，一个月放假。这样的比例，对清华大学的具体情况是适合的。另一是：选择生产任务要与学习的要求衔接得好。生产劳动纳入教学过程后，理论教学与生产劳动结成了一个完整的教学过程。从而，生产应该有计划、有目的地进行；学校办厂必须结合专业，需要按专业的性质和教学要求选择生产任务。到校外去参加生产劳动，也应争取满足教学要求。当然，某些生产劳动虽然不结合专业，如确属必要，也应该组织学生参加，但份量不宜过多。其三，在安排学生的生产劳动以及科学研究工作时，需要根据精一通多的原则，除了使其能掌握某一技能达到相当熟练的水平外，同时应该采取适当轮换工种、集体讨论生产任务、开生产会议、总结生产经验等方法，使学生对整个工作都能掌握或了解。特别是完成一项生产任务或科学研究任务之后，根据学习要求集体进行总结非常必要。总结的过程，是相互交流经验取长补短全面培养学生的一个重要过程，也是把实践中得到的知识上升到理论的过程。
    实行教学与生产劳动结合之后，清华大学在讲授基础理论课的问题上一直是掌握得比较稳的。虽然，也曾局部地有教师片面地强调基础课不能结合专业，认为结合专业会削弱系统理论的讲授；同时，也有人主张把某些基础理论课加以取消，或拆散分到专业技术课中去。清华大学的党组织坚决反对了这两种片面的观点，指出了基础理论课在传授一般自然规律使学生有广阔的基础理论知识，和培养学生的辩证唯物主义的世界观和思想方法上的极重要的意义；同时，指出了基础理论课结合工程专业的实际需要进行讲授，对于提高基础理论课的教学质量的重要作用。一年来，清华大学保证了基础理论课的应有的学时，不仅没有使学生在掌握系统理论方面有所削弱，而且由于进一步结合了工程专业，联系了实际，讲授的内容比过去教学大纲中规定的更为丰富，更为透彻了。许多基础理论课教师由于参加了专业的生产劳动和科学研究，创造了提高基础理论课的教学质量的一些有价值的讲授方法，并且找到了使某些基础理论有可能适应工程实际的需要而不断提高的正确途径。
    一年来，清华大学贯彻了在党委领导下教师、学生、能者三结合的群众路线，充分发挥了广大师生员工的创造性积极性，这样得以在生产、教学、科学研究上迅速展开了波澜壮阔的群众运动。上万个学生和工人、教师一起在全校各处大办各种类型的工厂，几十个几百个教师、学生、工人结合一起猛攻尖端技术；全校师生在大办工厂、猛攻科学尖端的同时，又掀起了广泛而深刻的教学改革运动，对教学计划、教学大纲、教学内容和教学方法，进行了重大的改革。清华大学的党组织坚决相信群众的创造性是无穷无尽的，不断根据党的方针提出振奋人心的任务，鼓舞和组织群众起来实践，并及时地把实践中群众创造的经验加以总结，再贯彻下去。这样做，学校内各方面的积极因素调动起来了，在半年多的短短的时间内，完成了照“常规”许多年也干不完的工作，人们从来也没有想到在清华大学内蕴藏着这么惊人的潜力！
    清华大学党组织在贯彻群众路线中，坚决批判了那种把专家和群众对立起来的观点。肯定在实行教育与生产劳动结合以后，教师在教学中的主导作用不是降低而是提高了。并且肯定：要充分发挥教师的这种作用，必须让他们与广大群众结合起来。一年来清华大学在教学、生产和科学研究上的每一个重要的成就，都是和这种结合分不开的。经过这样的结合，一种新的师生关系正在成长。同时，清华大学十分重视工农群众和一切有实际经验的人与教师、学生的结合。他们组织校内工人为学生讲课，邀请劳动模范来校表演、演讲，辅导和审查毕业设计，并提出学生要拜天下能人为师，派遣他们去校外作现场访问，参观各种技术革新展览会。这样不断吸受校内外工农劳动者和生产能手的丰富经验，让人民群众的智慧不断流进学校，促使教学和科学研究质量的不断得到提高。
