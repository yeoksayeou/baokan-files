Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Ministry of Light Industry has determined to use three prongs to ensure a greater leap forward in China's sugar industry in 1959. These three measures are to tightly grasp sugar material production, vigorously carry out technical revolution, and vigorously establish sugar factories in people's communes.

Sugar material is the key issue for the development of the sugar industry. In 1958, the planting area of ​​sugar cane and sugar beet in China increased significantly compared to 1957. Sugar beet planting areas have expanded from the three regions of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia to twenty-four provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Newly emerging sugar beet producing areas, such as Hubei Province, have a sugar beet cultivation area of ​​800,000 mu, becoming one of the major sugar beet producing areas in the country. In order to ensure that sugar materials can be supplied on time and in sufficient quantities this year, the Ministry of Light Industry is working with agricultural departments to study how to further expand the planting area of ​​sugar materials and increase the yield per unit area to promote increased sugar material production. At the same time, the Ministry of Light Industry also requires large and medium-sized sugar factories in various regions to sign raw material supply contracts with local people's communes to ensure timely supply of sugar materials, and to establish experimental farms in major sugar material producing areas to vigorously carry out the cultivation of improved varieties and the propagation of seeds, laying the foundation for vigorously developing sugar material production in the future.

Another measure for the leap forward in the sugar industry this year is to vigorously carry out technical revolution, promote advanced experience, and leverage the potential of old factories. The Ministry of Light Industry has decided to comprehensively promote the sugarcane leaching method of sugar production experience from Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, in the new large, medium and small sugarcane sugar factories to be built nationwide this year. The leaching method of sugar production requires simple equipment, has a high sugar extraction rate, and can save a lot of steel and power. For example, a four-roller press sugar factory with a daily crushing capacity of 15 tons of sugarcane requires 1,200 kilograms of steel and a 7-10 horsepower power machine; while building a leaching method sugar factory of the same scale only requires dozens of kilograms of steel, and the power can be saved by more than half. A large pressing method sugar factory with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons of sugarcane requires more than 900 tons of steel and a 1,300 horsepower power machine for the pressing equipment alone; if it is changed to the leaching method, at least 600 tons of steel and 1,000 horsepower power machine can be saved.

China has a long history of indigenous sugar production methods, but due to backward tools and equipment, poor working conditions, and low production efficiency, it cannot adapt to the new situation of the current great leap forward in the sugar industry. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously carry out reform and improvement work. To this end, the Ministry of Light Industry requires that indigenous sugar factories in various regions universally adopt animal power, wind power, water power, and biogas as power this year, and use non-metallic materials such as bamboo, wood, and ceramics as equipment to achieve simple mechanization and continuous production, reduce fuel consumption, and improve production capacity. While carrying out technological innovation, each sugar factory should establish comprehensive factories centered on sugar materials to make full use of beet shreds, waste molasses, sugarcane residue, filter mud, etc. The Ministry of Light Industry also requires various regions to train technical personnel for sugar production and sugar material production as quickly as possible, especially large and medium-sized sugar factories, to run part-work, part-study sugar production vocational schools to promote the growth of sugar production technical strength.

People's communes running sugar factories is an important link in the sugar industry's implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy. There are many benefits to people's communes running sugar factories, such as sourcing materials locally, processing them locally, selling products locally, and utilizing by-products locally, shortening transportation, and facilitating the comprehensive utilization of equipment. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 small sugar factories have been built across the country last year, with a total production capacity of more than 500,000 tons. Most of these small sugar factories are run by people's communes. Areas with faster development, such as Enshi Prefecture in Hubei, have built more than 1,000 sugar factories; the "small indigenous groups" of the sugar industry in Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanxi and other places have also seen great development. These small sugar factories can produce large quantities of maltose, which can meet the needs of industries such as pharmaceuticals, pastries, and fruit candies. The newly built small factories in the previous period have shortcomings such as low sugar extraction rates, high costs, and high labor input due to the short construction time and lack of experience. The Ministry of Light Industry has organized technicians from old sugar producing areas to go to key provinces and regions to assist them in solving technical problems. In order to accelerate the construction of small sugar factories this year, the Ministry of Light Industry is preparing to propose some simple and feasible methods suitable for people's communes to run sugar factories in terms of design, technical management, and equipment utilization, and requires large sugar factories in various regions to play a backbone role and provide technical support and assistance to small factories.

    抓紧糖料生产　大闹技术革命　公社大办糖厂
    三管齐下增产食糖
    轻工业部确定今年制糖工业跃进措施
    新华社27日讯　轻工业部确定三管齐下来保证1959年我国制糖工业更大跃进。这三项措施就是紧抓糖料生产，大闹技术革命，在人民公社大办糖厂。
    糖料是制糖工业发展的关键问题。1958年我国甘蔗、甜菜的种植面积比1957年有很大增长，甜菜种植地区已经由黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古三个地区扩大到二十四个省、市、自治区。新起的甜菜制糖区如湖北省，甜菜耕作面积已有八十万亩，成为全国甜菜主要产区之一。为了保证今年糖料能够按时按量供应，轻工业部正在同农业部门研究如何进一步扩大糖料种植面积、提高单位面积产量等问题，以促进糖料增产。同时，轻工业部还要求各地大中型糖厂跟当地人民公社订立原料供应合同，以保证糖料及时供应，并且在糖料的主要产区建立试验场，大力开展良种的培养及种籽的繁殖工作，为今后大力发展糖料生产打下基础。
    今年制糖工业跃进的另一措施，是大闹技术革命，推广先进经验，发挥老厂潜力。轻工业部决定今年在全国新建的大中小型甘蔗制糖厂中，全面推广江西省东乡县甘蔗浸出法制糖经验。浸出法制糖需要的设备简单，出糖率高，能节省大量钢铁和动力。如一部日榨十五吨甘蔗的四辊压榨法糖厂，需要钢铁一千二百公斤，七到十马力的动力机；而办同样规模的浸出法制糖厂，只需要几十公斤钢铁，动力可以节省一半多。一个日榨甘蔗两千吨的大型压榨法糖厂，仅压榨设备就要九百多吨钢铁，一千三百马力的动力机；改为浸出法以后，至少可以节省六百吨钢铁、一千马力的动力机。
    我国的土法制糖有悠久的历史，但是由于工具设备落后，劳动条件较差，生产效率不高，不能适应目前制糖工业大跃进的新形势，因此必须大力进行改革和提高的工作。为此，轻工业部要求各地手工制糖厂今年要普遍采用畜力、风力、水力、沼气作动力，采用竹木陶瓷等非金属材料作设备，实现简易机械化和生产连续化，降低燃料消耗，提高生产能力。在开展技术革新的同时，各糖厂要建立以糖料为中心的综合工厂，充分利用甜菜丝、废糖蜜、甘蔗渣、滤泥等。轻工业部还要求各地用最快的速度来培养制糖和糖料生产的技术人员，特别是大中型糖厂，要举办半工半读的制糖专业学校，以促使制糖技术力量的增长。
    人民公社办糖厂，是制糖工业贯彻“两条腿走路”方针的重要一环。人民公社办糖厂的好处很多，可以就地取料、就地加工、就地销售产品、就地利用副产品，缩短运输，便于设备综合利用等。据不完全统计，去年已在全国建设起小糖厂近一万个，总生产能力达到五十多万吨。这些小糖厂大部分是人民公社办的。发展较快的如湖北恩施专区，已建成一千多个糖厂；黑龙江、甘肃、山西等地制糖工业的“小土群”，也都有了很大的发展。这些小糖厂能生产大批饴糖，可以满足药剂、糕点和水果糖等行业的需要。前一时期新建的小厂，由于建厂时间短、缺乏经验，还存在着出糖率低、成本高、用劳动力多等缺点。轻工业部已组织各老制糖区技术人员，分赴重点省区，协助他们解决技术问题。为了加速今年小糖厂的建设工作，轻工业部准备提出一些适合人民公社办糖厂的设计、技术管理、设备利用等方面简易可行的办法，并且要求各地大型糖厂能起骨干作用，对小厂在技术上加以支持和帮助。（附图片）
