    Changes in Kalinovka Village
    ——A Record of the Development of a Soviet Collective Farm Over Five Years
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang

    When we were close to Kalinovka village, it was almost dark. The winter in central Russia is very short. Around 5:00 PM, as soon as the sun sets, the earth plunges into the dark night in no time at all.

    The car moved forward in the hilly area covered with a layer of white snow, climbed a small hill, and went down to a shrub-filled valley. The short trees on both sides were covered with frost and snow, forming a wonderful scene of snow-covered trees and silver flowers. After the small jeep crossed a wooden bridge, we saw a cluster of yellow lights in the distance. A Soviet friend in the car said that was Kalinovka village.

    Kalinovka village is a small village in Khomutovka District, Kursk Oblast, but now its name has spread not only throughout the Soviet Union but also abroad. Comrade Khrushchev has mentioned the achievements of this farm more than once in his speeches, and Soviet newspapers and periodicals have also used a lot of space to introduce its advanced experience. "Pravda" said that Kalinovka village is a laboratory of Soviet collective farm life. After 1953, this farm turned from backward to advanced. It actively implemented the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee on the development of agriculture, and tried to find ways to tap its potential in many ways, and finally achieved brilliant results in production. From the changes in this collective farm, we can not only see the road to prosperity of a collective farm, but also see an epitome of the upsurge in Soviet agriculture in recent years.

    Great Achievements in Five Years

    The next morning, the chairman of the collective farm, Grachev, described to us the changes in the farm over the past five years.

    The resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee opened up broad prospects for the development of Soviet agriculture. The situation in Kalinovka in the past five years is a vivid example. In 1953, there were only forty-seven dairy cows in the Kalinovka farm, and the average milk yield per cow was only 1,164 kilograms; now, not only has the number of dairy cows increased to 310, but the average milk yield per cow is 3,300 kilograms, almost tripled. In order to better illustrate the achievements in this regard, it is useful to cite a few more figures: in 1953, the farm produced an average of 42 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of arable land. If it were to catch up with the United States, it should reach an average of 333 quintals per 100 hectares, while in 1958, Kalinovka produced 575 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of land.

    This is the situation in livestock production. What about grain production? The average yield of grain per hectare in Kalinovka has increased from 7.4 quintals in 1953 to 17 quintals in 1958, an increase of more than double. In Kalinovka, industrial crops occupy a major position. In addition to sugar beets and alfalfa, this place is most suitable for growing ramie. In 1958, the farm received an income of 2 million rubles from selling ramie to the state. In 1958, the total income of the entire farm increased from 680,000 rubles in 1953 to 4 million rubles.

    Five years ago, the houses in Kalinovka village were small earthen houses built after the war. After nightfall, the streets were pitch black, and oil lamps were lit in the houses. But now, it has built its own power station. After nightfall, the lights in front of the cultural palace are brightly lit, and movies are shown inside. In addition, you can also see a long row of beautiful new houses at the entrance of the village, with snow-white window curtains hanging on the windows. On another street, we also saw a two-story building under construction, which is the future school building of the farm's middle school. The farm's chief agronomist, Vanin, told us, "When you look around from the center of the village, all the new and good buildings appeared after 1953, such as the three new-style cowsheds and feed workshops in the north of the village, the soil and fertilizer testing laboratory in the south of the village, and so on."

    When introducing the farm's situation to us, the farm chairman also told a joke. He said that five or six years ago, some people in the farm believed that they could not exert their strength in the countryside, so they packed their bags and went to the city to find work. At that time, many girls on the farm also hoped to find a young man from another place and marry to another village. But now, the people who left their hometown have returned, and the girls in the village have not only not married to other villages, but in the past three or four months, twenty-two young men have come to Kalinovka village to "marry in"...

    In just five years, the farm has undergone such great changes. What is the reason for this?

    Farm Chairman Grachev said: "The main reason for the farm's changes is the correctness of the Party's policies. Today's achievements should first of all be attributed to the Party's leadership. A series of resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee after 1953 gave us new strength and pointed out the correct path for developing production. For example, in accordance with the spirit of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers' resolution on changing the agricultural planning system, we studied what should be planted more and what should be planted less on our land, based on actual conditions, and re-studied the issue of land utilization. There are two treasures that have made our farm rich, one is ramie, and the other is corn. Ramie is a specialty of our area, so we appropriately expanded its planting area, adopted excellent varieties, vigorously applied fertilizer and strengthened field management. Therefore, the harvest of ramie has been continuously improved, and the farm's income has also increased. If ramie has opened up cash resources for us, then corn has laid a solid foundation for the development of our animal husbandry. Before 1953, the farm only relied on planting pasture to prepare feed for livestock, but the yield of pasture was limited, and sometimes the livestock were not full in winter. Later, under the call of the Party, we vigorously planted corn, and as a result, the feed immediately increased several times. In 1953, we had a total of only 120 tons of feed. In 1958, we prepared 5,400 tons of feed just by relying on corn. Every cow is well fed, and the milk yield has greatly increased."

    The old farmer of the farm, Ploskin, also said: "The care of the CPSU Central Committee and Comrade Khrushchev for our farm is also one of the important reasons for our achievements. Comrade Khrushchev has come to visit us in his hometown every summer in recent years, and his several speeches and many specific suggestions to us have played a great role in encouraging our farm. For example, the collective farm members selling their private dairy cows to the farm, eliminating idle land, and building more houses were all suggestions made by Comrade Khrushchev."

    Farmers themselves no longer raise cattle

    In Kalinovka village, the sound of cattle cannot be heard in the yard of any farmer. In the morning, you can no longer see women adding grass and carrying water for the cattle. What you can see is: a large sleigh carrying a large bucket of milk parked in the center of the village, and people come from all directions with bottles and jars to collect milk. The farm chairman told us that now everyone in the village can receive one liter of milk per day, and the private dairy cows have been completely bought by the farm. How was this problem raised and solved?

    In the summer of 1956, Comrade Khrushchev came to the Kalinovka village collective farm. He learned that each dairy cow on the farm produced 3,500 kilograms of milk per year, while the average milk yield of private dairy cows of farmers was only more than 1,200 kilograms. Comrade Khrushchev suggested that the farmers think about whether they could sell their private dairy cows to the farm if the farm could fully supply them with milk, because each dairy cow could produce more than 1,000 kilograms of milk under the care of the farm.

    This was a new problem at the time. It is a fact that the farm's dairy cows produce more milk, because the farm has better conditions. For example, the cowshed is spacious and clean, and there are automatic drinking fountains in the cowshed. In addition, there are more ways for the farm to solve the problem of feed and the treatment of cattle after they get sick than the farmers alone. Under this comparison, since the farm guarantees a full supply of milk, why not sell the cattle to the farm? After consideration, the farmers unanimously expressed their willingness to sell the dairy cows to the farm. The farm decided to build a new cowshed in advance for this part of the dairy cows. Before the start of the autumn harvest in 1957, the farm acquired more than 200 private dairy cows from farmers. In order to take care of this group of dairy cows, the farm's Communist Youth League decided to establish a youth work team specifically responsible for this work.

    We visited this cowshed on the farm. Nearly 200 dairy cows were neatly arranged in four rows in the spacious cowshed. Their annual milk yield has jumped from more than 1,000 kilograms to 3,000 kilograms. A young girl pushed a grass-carrying car hanging on the iron pole under the roof to add grass to the livestock. An automated conveyor belt on the ground sent the cow dung out of the shed. The captain of the youth work team, Garovkina, told us that now their work team has a total of fourteen members, and everyone has put forward new guarantees, and the whole team is striving to become a communist labor work team.

    Selling dairy cows to the farm has also brought benefits to the farmers. A female farmer said: "The milk supplied by the farm is cheap and sufficient. In the past, I had to get up before dawn to add grass and carry water for the cattle. Now I can let the children bring the milk back in the morning. With more time, I can work more for the farm and take care of the children more."

    Future Plans

    When we came to the collective farm, it was the time when the people of the Soviet Union were enthusiastically discussing the seven-year plan. The farm also has a preliminary draft of the development plan for the next seven years. According to this plan, the production of grain and animal husbandry will be greatly improved. For example, the production of meat will strive to reach the level of 140 quintals per 100 hectares of arable land, and milk will also reach 800 quintals per 100 hectares of land. In addition, the farm will also build many new houses and establish boarding schools and nursing homes. In addition, the plan will also include two important new measures: one is to establish a public vegetable garden on the farm and abolish the farmers' private plots; the other is to replace the current labor-day remuneration system with a salary system. When talking about these two measures, the farm chairman said: "The central issue of abolishing the farmers' private plots is how to supply everyone with enough vegetables. If the farm establishes a large vegetable market and organizes a special production team to produce the necessary products such as potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers for everyone, then each farmer will not have to grow vegetables by himself. The solution to the dairy cow problem has given us a lot of experience. As for the issue of adopting a salary system, we plan to start trying it out this year. Two years ago, we tried out a system of pre-paying part of the salary every month, and the implementation effect was very good. Farmers can get a certain income every month, which greatly improves everyone's production enthusiasm. Now we have absorbed the experience of some farms in Ukraine and plan to start trying out the salary system at the end of January."

    In the farm's future plan, there is also an important task, which is to merge with the "Red Flag" collective farm. The "Red Flag" farm has more than 3,000 hectares of arable land, more than twice as much as Kalinovka, but the production level there is lower. The purpose of the merged operation is to quickly improve the production level of the "Red Flag" farm.

    At the end of the visit, Comrade Grachev talked about the issue of the CPSU Central Committee's December 1958 Plenary Session held in Moscow not long ago. This meeting summarized the experience of the Soviet Union's five-year agricultural development. Comrade Grachev said, "As an ordinary party member, I was able to be invited to participate in such an important meeting. This is an unforgettable event in my life. I was extremely moved, especially when I knew that I was going to speak. I truthfully reported to everyone the changes in our farm in the past five years. When I talked about the issue of merging with the 'Red Flag' farm, I said that it would take two or three years to improve the merged farm to our level. At this time, Comrade Khrushchev said, 'Two years is enough!' Comrade Khrushchev's sentence has now become the goal of our farm's struggle. I hope you will come again in two years, and then you will see a larger and richer farm." (Attached picture)

    “卡里诺夫卡”村的变化
    ——记苏联一个集体农庄五年来的发展
    本报记者　崔永昌
    当我们快到“卡里诺夫卡”村的时候，天已经快黑了。中部俄罗斯的冬天很短，五点多钟，太阳一落山，不过一支烟的功夫，大地就沉入在漆黑的夜幕中了。
    汽车在铺着一层白雪的丘陵地带前进，爬上一个不高的山坡，又下到灌木丛生的低谷，两旁的短树披满了霜雪，构成了一幅雪树银花的奇景。小吉普车又跨过一座木桥之后，我们看到了远处一团黄色的灯火，同车的一位苏联朋友说，那就是卡里诺夫卡村了。
    卡里诺夫卡村是库尔斯克州霍木托夫卡区的一个小村落，但是现在它的名字不但传遍了全苏联，并且也传到了国外。赫鲁晓夫同志在讲话中不止一次地谈到这个农庄的成就，苏联各地报刊也曾经用大量篇幅介绍它的先进经验，“真理报”说，卡里诺夫卡村是苏联集体农庄生活的一个试验室。1953年以后这个农庄由落后变成先进，它积极地贯彻了苏共中央关于发展农业的决议，并且从多方面想办法，挖潜力，终于在生产上取得了辉煌的成绩。从这个集体农庄的变化中，我们不但可以看出一个集体农庄走向繁荣的道路，并且也可以看到苏联农业近年来高涨的一个缩影。
    五年来的巨大成就
    第二天早晨，集体农庄主席格拉乔夫向我们描述了这个农庄五年来的变化。
    苏共中央1953年9月全会的决议给苏联农业发展开辟了广阔的道路。卡里诺夫卡五年来的情况就是一个生动的例证。1953年卡里诺夫卡农庄中只有四十七头奶牛，每头奶牛的产奶量平均只有一千一百六十四公斤；现在不仅奶牛已增到三百一十头，而且每头奶牛的产奶量平均是三千三百公斤，几乎增加了两倍。为了更好地说明这方面的成绩，不妨再引证几个数目字：在1953年农庄在每一百公顷耕地上平均生产牛奶四十二公担，如果要赶上美国，应当达到每一百公顷平均生产三百三十三公担，而在1958年卡里诺夫卡每一百公顷土地上就生产了五百七十五公担牛奶。
    畜牧业生产方面是这样，谷物生产方面又是怎样呢？卡里诺夫卡每公顷粮食的平均产量已从1953年的七点四公担增加到1958年的十七公担，即增加了一倍以上。在卡里诺夫卡，技术作物占着主要地位，除去甜菜、紫苜蓿以外，这儿最适于种苎麻，1958年农庄从卖给国家的苎麻上得到了达二百万卢布的收入。1958年，整个农庄的总收入从1953年的六十八万卢布一跃而增加为四百万卢布。
    五年前的卡里诺夫卡村里，住房都是一些战后修起来的小土屋，入夜后，街上一片漆黑，房子里点的是油灯。但是现在，这里建起了自己的电站，入夜后，文化宫门前灯火辉煌，里面放映着电影。除此以外你在村头上还可以看到一长排漂亮的新住房，雪白的窗帷挂在窗上。在另外一条街上我们还看到正在动工修建的两层楼房，这是未来农庄中学的校舍。农庄总农艺师瓦尼因向我们说，“你在村中央向四周一看，凡是新的、好的建筑全是1953年以后出现的，例如村北面的三个新式牛棚和饲料车间，村南面的土壤、肥料化验室等等全是。”
    农庄主席在向我们介绍农庄的情况时，还说了一个笑话。他说，五六年前农庄里有些人认为在农村不能发挥自己的力量，所以就背上行李到城市里去找工作了。那时农庄的许多姑娘也都希望找个外地的小伙子，嫁到外乡去。但是现在呢，离开家乡的人回来了，村里的姑娘不但没有嫁到外村去，并且在最近三、四月内还有二十二个小伙子到卡里诺夫卡村来“入赘”……。
    短短的五年之间，农庄发生了这么大的变化，这是什么原因呢？
    农庄主席格拉乔夫说：“农庄变化的主要原因是党的政策正确。今天的成绩首先应当归功于党的领导。1953年后苏共中央的一系列决议给了我们新的力量，并且指出了发展生产的正确道路。例如，按照苏共中央和部长会议关于改变农业计划制度的决议的精神，我们从实际出发，研究了在我们的土地上应当多种什么，少种什么，并且重新研究了土地的利用问题。使我们农庄变富的有两个宝贝，一个是苎麻，一个是玉米。苎麻是我们这一带的特产，所以我们适当地扩大了它的播种面积，采用了优良品种，大力施肥并加强田间管理，因此苎麻的收获量不断提高，农庄的收入也跟着增多了。如果说苎麻为我们开辟了现金资源，那么玉米便为我们发展畜牧业打下了巩固基础。1953年以前，农庄只靠种牧草给牲口准备饲料，但牧草产量有限，结果冬天有时牲口吃不饱。后来在党的号召下，我们大力种玉米，结果饲料马上增加了几倍，1953年我们一共只有一百二十吨饲料，1958年光靠玉米我们就准备了五千四百吨饲料。每头牛全吃得饱饱的，产奶量就大大提高了。”
    农庄的老庄员普洛斯金还说：“苏共中央和赫鲁晓夫同志对我们农庄的关怀也是我们取得成绩的重要原因之一。赫鲁晓夫同志近年来每年夏天都到自己的故乡来看望我们，他的几次讲话和给我们提出的许多具体建议在我们农庄中起了很大的鼓舞作用。例如集体农庄庄员把私人的奶牛卖给农庄，取消空闲地和多建住房，就都是赫鲁晓夫同志的建议。”
    庄员自己不再养牛了
    在卡里诺夫卡村，在任何一个庄员的院子里都听不到牛叫了。早晨，你再也看不到妇女们为牛添草、担水的情况了，你可以看到的是：一乘很大的雪橇驮着一大桶牛奶停在村中央，人们从四面八方提着瓶瓶罐罐到这里来领牛奶。农庄主席告诉我们说，现在村里每人每天可以领一公升牛奶，私人的奶牛已经由农庄完全买下来了。这个问题是怎样提出来又怎样解决的呢？
    1956年夏天赫鲁晓夫同志来到卡里诺夫卡村集体农庄，他了解到农庄的每头奶牛每年产奶三千五百公斤，而庄员私人的奶牛平均只能产奶一千二百多公斤。赫鲁晓夫同志就建议庄员们想一想，如果农庄能够充分供给他们牛奶，能不能把私人奶牛卖给农庄，因为在农庄的照管下每头奶牛可以多产一千多公斤奶。
    当时这是一个新问题。农庄的奶牛出奶多是事实，因为农庄的条件好，例如牛棚既宽大又清洁，牛棚里有自动饮水器。此外，还有解决饲料问题和牛生病后的医治问题等等，农庄都比庄员一个人的办法多。在这种对比之下，既然农庄保证充分供应牛奶，那么为什么不把牛卖给农庄呢？庄员们在考虑之后一致表示愿意把奶牛卖给农庄。农庄决定为这部分奶牛预先筑起一个新牛棚。在1957年的秋收开始之前，农庄收购了二百多头庄员私人的奶牛。为了照顾这群奶牛，农庄共青团决定成立一个青年工作队专门负责这件工作。
    在农庄里我们参观了这个牛棚，将近二百头乳牛在宽大的牛棚里整整齐齐地排成四行，它们每年的产奶量已由一千多公斤跃升到三千公斤了。一个青年姑娘推着吊在棚顶下面铁杆上的运草车在给牲口添草，地面上一个自动化的运送带把牛粪送到棚外。青年工作队队长加罗芙金娜告诉我们说，现在她们的工作队共有十四个队员，每个人全提出了新的保证，全队正在争取做共产主义劳动工作队。
    奶牛卖给农庄，也给庄员们带来了好处。一位女庄员说：“农庄供给的奶又便宜又够用。以前天不亮就要起来为牛添草、担水，现在早晨让孩子把牛奶领回来就可以了。时间多了，可以为农庄多干活，也可以多照顾一下孩子。”
    未来的计划
    我们来到集体农庄时正是苏联全国人民热烈讨论七年计划的时候。农庄在七年中的发展规划也已有了初步草案，根据这个计划，粮食和畜牧业的生产都将大大提高，例如肉类的生产要争取达到每百公顷耕地一百四十公担的水平，牛奶在每百公顷土地上也要达到八百公担。另外农庄还要建造许多新的住宅，成立寄宿中学和养老院等。此外，计划中还将包括两项重要的新措施：一个是建立农庄的公共菜园，取消庄员的自留地；另一个是用薪金制代替现行的劳动日计酬制。在谈到这两项措施时，农庄主席说：“取消庄员自留地的中心问题是如何供应大家有足够蔬菜的问题。如果农庄成立一个大型菜场，组织一个专门生产队生产供给大家的土豆，西红柿，白菜，黄瓜等等必需品，那么每个庄员就可以不必自己去种菜了。奶牛问题的解决给我们积蓄了很多经验。至于采用薪金制的问题，我们准备在今年就开始试行。两年前我们试行了每月预付部分薪金的制度，实行的效果很好，庄员每月可以得到一定收入，这大大提高了大家的生产热情。现在我们吸收了乌克兰一些农庄的经验，准备在1月底开始试行薪金制。”
    在农庄的未来计划中还有一项重要的任务，这便是与“红旗”集体农庄合并。“红旗”农庄有三千多公顷耕地，比卡里诺夫卡多一倍以上，但是那里生产水平低一些。合并经营的目的是使“红旗”农庄的生产水平迅速提高起来。
    在结束访问的时候，格拉乔夫同志谈到了不久前在莫斯科举行的苏共中央1958年12月全会的问题，这次会议总结了苏联农业五年发展的经验。格拉乔夫同志说，“作为一个普通的党员，我能够被邀参加这样一个重要的会议，这是我一生难忘的事件。特别当我知道要我讲话时，我感动极了。我实事求是地向大家报告了我们农庄五年来的变化。当我谈到同‘红旗’农庄合并的问题时，我说用两三年的时间可以把合并进来的农庄也提高到我们的水平。这时赫鲁晓夫同志说，‘用两年就够了！’赫鲁晓夫同志的这句话现在已成为我们农庄的奋斗目标。希望你两年后再来，那时你就可以看到一个更大的富足的农庄了。”（附图片）
