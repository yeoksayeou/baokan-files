Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the working class, bold in thought and action, has shattered the old notion that high-rise buildings and large factories cannot be built without steel and wood. In early July 1958, Nanjing City first used fiberglass instead of steel bars to build a dormitory building; in early September, Harbin saw the emergence of "four-no" buildings constructed without steel, wood, cement, or red bricks.

The characteristics of these new building materials are: lightweight, sturdy, beautiful, inexpensive, and more effective in earthquake and fire resistance than other materials. The raw materials for manufacturing these new materials are generally clay, sand, limestone, etc., which can be sourced locally. Promoting these new materials can save steel and wood and promote the high-speed development of industrial and agricultural capital construction.

Currently, there are more than twenty types of new building materials. Here are some examples:

    Ceramic Radiators

China began producing ceramic radiators in 1956. Replacing cast iron radiators with them can save a significant amount of cast iron. If all places requiring radiators nationwide used this type, the annual savings in cast iron could build 260,000 double-wheel double-铧 plows. From a usage perspective, besides being essentially the same in terms of heat performance, ceramic radiators also have greater corrosion resistance than iron radiators, and their appearance is more polished and beautiful.

    Fiberglass

Fiberglass is made by pressing glass fibers and plastic together. Fiberglass can be pressed into various shapes of building materials. Its mechanical strength exceeds that of ordinary steel and alloy aluminum, yet it is stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. Its impact strength exceeds many metals, it has low thermal conductivity, high insulation, and it is resistant to acid, alkali, and various chemical erosions. It can withstand temperatures up to 200 degrees Celsius and weighs three-quarters to four-fifths less than steel.

This new type of glass material can not only replace most of the steel bars and shaped steel in construction projects, but it is also a necessary material for building hulls for boats, cars, and airplanes, as well as industrial pipelines and the petroleum and electromechanical industries.

    Glass Fiber

The glass fiber industry is a new industry that has developed over the past thirty years. China began trial-producing glass fiber in 1956, and now general glass factories, and even construction sites, can manufacture it. The manufacturing method involves placing glass balls or blocks into a crucible, heating them to a high temperature of 1200 to 1400 degrees Celsius until the glass balls melt. The molten glass is then drawn down through fine holes at the bottom of the crucible, and a drawing machine pulls out glass filaments at a speed of 2,000 to 3,000 meters per minute. These filaments are very thin, only about one-tenth to one-fifteenth the thickness of a human hair. Their strength can withstand a minimum of 3,500 kilograms per square centimeter, equivalent to the strength of "Steel Three" steel. If glass fibers are treated with plastic to make various rods, bars, and plates, the strength is even higher. It can replace steel bars to make fiberglass concrete slabs and concrete columns, used in general building structures, can meet or exceed the requirements of steel bar designs. Furthermore, it retains the characteristics of glass, such as smoothness, flexibility, tensile strength, heat resistance, and fire resistance, and is also a good insulating material.

    Wet-Milled Slag Concrete

Wet-milled slag concrete, also known as activated slag concrete, is made directly from slag (the waste residue from steelmaking) and has high strength. Currently, blast furnaces are blooming everywhere in China, and the annual production of slag is very large. For every ton of steel produced, one ton of slag is produced. This type of slag concrete is easy to make: the blast furnace slag is water-quenched, then ground with water, and an appropriate amount of lime or cement (preferably cement) is added to form concrete. Its strength can be formulated to 500 to 800 grade (i.e., it can withstand a pressure of 500 or 800 kilograms per square centimeter. The same applies below); if used to cast concrete below 300 grade, cement can be completely omitted. This type of concrete sets quickly and has the following advantages over ordinary concrete: low drying shrinkage, high abrasion resistance, good impermeability and waterproofness, and good frost resistance and thermal insulation properties. It is particularly suitable for use in prestressed structures.

    High-Pressure Glass Tubes

High-pressure glass tubes look similar to ordinary large glass tubes, but their performance is different. They are heat-resistant, pressure-resistant, acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and resistant to various chemical erosions, making them fully capable of replacing seamless steel pipes and stainless-steel pipes. Currently, China can produce pipes of various diameters from half an inch to eight inches. Tests have shown that they can withstand pressures up to ten atmospheres. These large tubes can be used as various pipelines in the chemical, petroleum, and food industries.

    Asphalt Plastic Non-Woven Roofing Felt

Asphalt plastic non-woven roofing felt is made by rolling and calendaring asphalt, polyvinyl chloride, dibutyl phthalate, and West Lake mud. It can replace roofing waterproofing materials and can also be used as flooring material. For floors with special requirements, it can completely replace rubber sheets. It is better than ordinary roofing felt, being heat-resistant and non-flowing, non-sticky; cold-resistant, does not crack when folded, and is impermeable. A single layer of asphalt plastic roll material is equivalent to the roofing roll material of "three felts and four oils," is cheaper than ordinary roll material, and is safer for workers to operate as it does not require high temperatures. Winter construction also does not require preheating, preventing sliding and fall injuries.

    Lightweight Large Bricks

Lightweight large bricks are a new type of building material that is inexpensive, high-quality, high-strength, lightweight, and easy for mechanized construction. It is a brand-new product in China and also a brand-new product in the world. It is made by placing ordinary clay blocks in refractory molds and firing them in a refractory brick kiln to 1150 degrees Celsius, where they melt and expand. Its compressive strength varies with the bulk density: a bulk density of 400 to 800 kilograms is equivalent to ordinary bricks of 75 to 150 grade. Bricks of 150 grade can completely replace ordinary bricks for load-bearing structures.

These lightweight large bricks are several times larger than ordinary bricks but weigh one-half to four-fifths less than ordinary bricks of the same volume. They are impermeable, frost-resistant, and have good sound absorption and insulation properties. Replacing clay bricks with them as wall materials can greatly reduce the self-weight of buildings and can also replace foamed concrete, saving a large amount of cement.

    Straw Hollow Bricks

Straw hollow bricks are a lightweight, sound-insulating, and heat-insulating new material, mainly used for non-load-bearing partition walls and can also be used as ceilings. When used as partition walls, they are no different from ordinary brick walls after plastering. This type of hollow brick is inexpensive and easy to manufacture: simply mix straw, lime, sawdust, and rice husk ash with water, and then press them into shape using an iron mold and a pressing machine.

    建筑材料推陈出新
    过去人们都认为，不用钢材、木材，就无法盖高层房屋和大型厂房。在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，敢想敢干的工人阶级用事实打破了这种老看法。1958年7月初，南京市第一次采用玻璃纤维代替钢筋盖起了一座宿舍大楼；9月初，哈尔滨又出现了不用钢材、木材、水泥、红砖，盖起了“四不用”大楼。
    新型建筑材料的特点是：体轻、坚固、美观、便宜，防震防火比其他材料有效。制造这些新型材料的原料，一般是粘土、砂子、石灰石等，各地可以就地取材。推广这些新型材料，可以节省钢材、木材，促进工农业基本建设高速度发展。
    目前，新型建筑材料有二十种以上，这里介绍一部分。
    陶瓷暖气片
    我国在1956年已经开始生产陶瓷暖气片。用它代替生铁暖气片，可以节约大量生铁。如果全国需用暖气片的地方都用这种暖气片，每年节约的生铁就可以造二十六万台双轮双铧犁。从使用效果上看，除了在热功性能方面两者基本相同以外，陶瓷暖气片还比铁制暖气片有更大的耐腐蚀性能，而且外表更加光洁漂亮。
    玻璃钢
    玻璃纤维和塑料经过加压，就能制成玻璃钢。玻璃钢可以压制成各种型状的建筑材料，机械强度超过普通钢和合金铝，但比钢强，比铝还轻，冲击强度超过很多金属，导热性低，绝缘性高，还抗酸、抗碱、抗多种药品的侵蚀，能耐二百度高温，重量比钢材轻四分之三或五分之四。
    这种新型的玻璃材料，不仅可以在建筑工程上代替绝大部分钢筋和型材，而且也是造船艇、汽车、飞机的外壳和工业管道以及石油、机电工业必需的材料。
    玻璃纤维
    玻璃纤维工业是近三十年才发展起来的新型工业。我国从1956年开始试制玻璃纤维，现在一般玻璃工厂，甚至工地都能制造。制造方法，是用玻璃球或玻璃块放到坩埚里，加热到一千二百至一千四百度高温时，玻璃球熔化，从坩埚底细孔漏下来，接着用拉丝机以每分钟二千至三千公尺的速度，就可以拉出玻璃丝。这种丝很细，只相当于一根头发的十分之一或十五分之一，它的强度每平方公分最低可抵得住三千五百公斤重，相当于“钢三”钢材的强度。如果将玻璃纤维用塑料处理后制成各种棒、条、板，则强度更高，它可代替钢筋做成玻璃纤维混凝土板及混凝土柱，用在一般建筑结构中，能达到或超过按钢筋设计的要求。而且它还保持着玻璃的特点，即光滑、柔软、耐拉、耐热、防火，又是绝缘的好材料。
    湿碾矿渣混凝土
    湿碾矿渣混凝土，又名活化矿渣混凝土，是直接用矿渣（就是炼钢后的废渣）制成的，强度很高。目前我国高炉遍地开花，矿渣年产量很大，生产多少吨钢，就可以出多少吨矿渣。这种矿渣混凝土制作方法简便，将高炉渣水淬后，带水碾磨，再加入适量的石灰或水泥（最好是水泥），即成混凝土。它的强度能配到五百号至八百号
  （即每平方公分可承受五百或八百公斤的压力。下同）；如果用它浇灌三百号以下的混凝土，则完全可以省去水泥，这种混凝土凝结快，比普通混凝土具有如下优点：干缩性小，抗磨性高，抗渗性、防水性好，能耐冻、保温隔热性能也好，用在预应力结构上特别合适。高压玻璃管
    高压玻璃管看起来和普通大型玻璃管相似，但它的性能和普通玻璃管不一样。它具有耐热、耐压、耐酸、耐碱、耐多种化学侵蚀的性能，完全能够代替无缝钢管和不锈钢管使用。目前我国已能制成半吋至八吋等各种口径的管子。经过试验证明，它承受得了十个气压以下的压力。这种大型管子可作化学、石油、食品等工业的各种管道。
    沥青塑料无胎油毡
    沥青塑料无胎油毡是用沥青，聚氯乙烯、苯二钾酸二丁脂、西湖泥配合，经过滚炼、压延制成的。它能代替屋面防水材料，也可做地面铺设材料，用在特殊要求的地面，它完全可以代替橡板。它比一般油毡还好，能耐热不流淌，不粘；能抗寒，对折不裂，不透水。一层沥青塑料卷材，可抵三毡四油的屋面卷材用，比普通卷材便宜，而且工人操作时安全，不用高温，冬季施工也无需加以预热，不会滑动发生摔伤事故。
    轻质大砖
    轻质大砖，是一种价廉、质优、强度高、体重轻、便于机械化施工的新型建筑材料。它在我国是崭新的产品，在世界上也是崭新的产品。它是用普通粘土块装在耐火的模子里放进耐火砖窑里烧到一千一百五十度熔解膨胀而成的制品。它的耐压强度随容重而不同：容重四百至八百公斤，则相当标号七十五号至一百五十号的普通砖。一百五十号的这种砖则完全可以代替普通砖做承重结构。
    这种轻质大砖比普通砖大好几倍，但比同体积的普通砖轻二分之一至五分之四。不透水，能耐冻，吸音隔音性能良好。用它代替粘土砖做墙体材料，可以大大减轻建筑物自重，也可以代替泡沫混凝土用，节约大量水泥。
    稻草空心砖
    稻草空心砖是一种轻质、隔音、隔热的新材料，主要用在不承重的间隔墙上，也可用作天棚。用作隔墙时，粉刷后与一般砖墙无异，这种空心砖造价低廉，制作简便，即将稻草、石灰、锯末、谷糠灰加水后用铁模和压制机压制而成。（附图片）
