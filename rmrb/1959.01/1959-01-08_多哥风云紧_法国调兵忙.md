Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Paris, 6th: French authorities are rushing to transfer troops to Togo, a territory in Africa under French trusteeship, because the national liberation movement of the Togolese people is flourishing, and they are demanding Togo's independence.

Newspapers report that a French motorized infantry unit has already been dispatched from Cotonou (the capital of Dahomey, adjacent to Togo), crossing the border and heading towards Lomé, the capital of Togo. A large concentration of French forces in Dahomey is on standby.

According to the French newspaper "l'Humanité," a batch of reinforcing French paratroopers is being flown from Dakar, French West Africa, to Cotonou on military transport planes. The newspaper says that these reinforcements are also going to Togo to fight.

The dispatch of troops to Togo has caused great unease among French democratic public opinion, which points out that France has formally guaranteed to grant Togo independence before 1960.

Togo was placed under French trusteeship by the United Nations in 1946.

    多哥风云紧　法国调兵忙
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社巴黎6日讯：法国当局正在赶忙把军队调往法国在非洲的托管地多哥，因为多哥人民的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展，他们要求多哥独立。
    据报纸报道，法国步兵摩托化部队已经由科托努（同多哥毗邻的达荷美的首府）出动，越过边境向多哥首都洛美开去。集中在达荷美的法国大批兵力已经处于备战状态。
    据法国“人道报”报道，一批增援的法国伞兵正从法属西非的达喀尔乘军用运输机飞往科托努。报纸说，这些增援部队也是到多哥去作战的。
    把军队调往多哥引起了法国民主舆论的极大不安，民主舆论指出，法国已经正式保证：在1960年以前给予多哥独立。
    多哥是在1946年由联合国交给法国托管的。
