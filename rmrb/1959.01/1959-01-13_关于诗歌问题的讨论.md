Editor's Note

    Regarding the development path of new poetry, the relationship between folk songs and new poetry, and other issues, we published Lu Xuebin's "Further Develop the New Folk Song Movement" and Sha Ou's "The Road of New Poetry" on December 10, 1958, and December 31, 1958, respectively. To further expand the discussion, we invited some poets, literary critics, and relevant editors of newspapers and periodicals in Beijing to a symposium on January 5th. The attendees included Ding Li, Bian Zhilin, Tian Jian, Sha Ou, Shen Jiping, Xu Chi, Zhang Guangnian, Guo Xiaochuan, He Jingzhi, Zang Kejia, Xiao San, and others. Zang Kejia, Bian Zhilin, Tian Jian, Zhang Guangnian, Shen Jiping, and others spoke at the meeting. The three articles published here, Zang Kejia's "Folk Songs and New Poetry," Bian Zhilin's "On the Development of Poetry," and Tian Jian's "Folk Songs Paved the Way for New Poetry," were written by the authors based on their own speeches. These articles mention articles already published by Comrades He Qifang, Bian Zhilin, and Zhang Guangnian. The first two were published in "Virgin Land" in July 1958, and the latter was published in "Red Flag" in the first issue of 1959. It also mentions an article by Comrade Li Yaqun, which appeared in "Stars" in November 1958.
