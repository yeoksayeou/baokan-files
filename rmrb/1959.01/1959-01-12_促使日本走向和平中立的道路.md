"Akahata" Calls on Japanese Democratic Forces to Unite
Promoting Japan's Path to Peace and Neutrality
Suzuki Says Socialist Party Will Fight Resolutely to Overthrow the Kishi Cabinet
General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and Neutral System Unions Decide to Launch Spring Labor Offensive
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 10th: "Akahata" published an article today pointing out that the time has come for Japanese democratic forces to force the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet to resign and dissolve the Diet.
The article pointed out that although the "mainstream faction" within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan has been forced to concede to the "anti-mainstream faction" and decided to reshuffle personnel; in reality, factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party are intensifying.
The article pointed out, however, that because Japanese monopoly capital wants the Liberal Democratic Party to avoid dissolving the Diet and wants the factions to "unite" to consolidate the Japan-U.S. "mutual assistance" system, Nobusuke Kishi may compromise with Hayato Ikeda of the "anti-mainstream faction." The article went on to say that if Nobusuke Kishi compromises with Ikeda, the Kishi government will immediately take steps to forcibly pass a series of reactionary bills such as the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill."
"Akahata" emphasized that, under these circumstances, the time has come for Japanese democratic forces to unite to oppose the Liberal Democratic Party's control of power, demand the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, correct Japan's subordinate relationship with the United States, and promote Japan's political path towards peace and neutrality. The article called on Japanese democratic forces to unite and fight to achieve the above goals.
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 11th: Japan Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki told reporters in Gamagori, Aichi Prefecture, on the 10th that Japan should pursue a policy of neutrality.
Suzuki stressed that the current deterioration of Japan-China relations is due to the Kishi Nobusuke government's pursuit of erroneous foreign policies.
Suzuki said that the Soviet Union and China had issued statements calling on the Japanese government to pursue a policy of neutrality that is in the best interests of the Japanese people. He said that the Socialist Party advocates a policy of peace, which means that Japan should maintain neutrality, establish friendly relations with all countries, and prevent atomic war.
Suzuki said: I think it is time for Japan to declare its willingness to pursue a policy of neutrality. Suzuki said that he would raise this issue at the Socialist Party Central Committee meeting to be held from the 19th.
Suzuki stated that the Japan Socialist Party will resolutely fight to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which is pursuing irresponsible policies.
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 10th: Representatives of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and neutral system unions held a joint spring struggle committee meeting in Tokyo this afternoon and decided to launch a labor offensive on February 25th. On this day, workers from various private sector industrial unions will hold a twenty-four-hour strike, and members of the Japan Council of Government and Public Corporation Workers' Unions will also carry out struggles of the same scale, depending on the circumstances.
The goals of the spring struggle stipulated by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan are: to demand higher wages, abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," restore Japan-China diplomatic relations, and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, etc.
The meeting decided that in order to prepare for the struggle, a spring struggle rally will be held simultaneously in various parts of Japan on February 14th.
In order to strive for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, the meeting decided to hold lectures in sixty small and medium-sized cities to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.
Around March 7th, in order to cooperate with the struggle in the Diet, various unions will also hold labor offensives, including simultaneous strikes, to demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government formulate a minimum wage system and ratify International Labor Organization conventions, etc.
In addition, the meeting decided to hold a central conference of the unemployed in Tokyo at the end of January and a conference on "demanding the compilation of budgets related to social insurance" in early February.
The meeting decided to strengthen local joint struggles, divide the country into six regions, and establish six regional joint struggle conferences in northern Kyushu and Yamaguchi, Shikoku, Kansai and Tokai, Kanto, Hokuriku, and Tohoku and Hokkaido respectively, to organize spring struggles in various regions.

    “赤旗报”号召日本民主力量联合起来
    促使日本走向和平中立的道路
    铃木表示社会党将为打倒岸内阁而坚决斗争
    总评和中立系统工会决定展开春季实力斗争
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表文章指出，日本民主力量迫使岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会的时机已经到来。
    文章指出，虽然日本执政党自由民主党内的“主流派”被迫对“反主流派”让步，决定刷新人事；但是，实际上自由民主党内部的派系斗争却在日益加剧。
    文章指出，可是，由于日本垄断资本要自由民主党避免解散国会，并且要各派“团结”，以巩固日美“相互援助”的体系，因此，岸信介有可能同“反主流派”的池田勇人妥协。文章接着指出，如果岸信介同池田妥协，岸信介政府将立即采取步骤，强行通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”等一系列的反动法案。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，在这种情况下，日本的民主力量团结起来反对自由民主党把持政权，要求岸信介内阁下台，纠正日本从属于美国的关系，促使日本的政治走向和平、中立的道路的时机已经到来。文章号召日本的民主力量联合起来，为实现上述目标而斗争。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎10日在爱知县蒲郡对记者发表谈话说，日本应当执行中立政策。
    铃木强调指出，目前日中关系恶化的原因，是由于岸信介政府执行了错误的外交政策。
    铃木谈到，苏联和中国曾经发表声明，呼吁日本政府执行最符合日本人民利益的中立政策。他说，社会党主张执行和平政策，这就是说，日本要保持中立，同一切国家建立友好关系和防止原子战争。
    铃木说：我认为，对于日本来说，应该是声明自己愿意执行中立政策的时候了。铃木表示要在从19日起举行的社会党中央委员会会议上提出这个问题。
    铃木表示，日本社会党将为打倒推行不负责任的政策的岸信介内阁而坚决奋斗。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会和中立系统工会的代表，今天下午在东京举行了春季斗争联合斗争委员会会议，决定在2月25日举行实力斗争。在这一天，各私营产业工会的工人将举行二十四小时的罢工，日本官公厅工会协议会的会员们也要根据情况进行同样规模的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会所规定的春季斗争的目标是：要求提高工资，废除日美“安全条约”，恢复日中邦交和打倒岸信介内阁等。
    会议决定，为了做好斗争的准备工作，2月14日要在日本各地同时举行春季斗争奋起大会。
    为了争取恢复日中邦交，会议决定要在六十个中小城市举行打开日中关系僵局的演讲会。
    3月7日前后，为了配合国会内的斗争，各工会还将举行包括同时罢工在内的实力斗争，要求岸信介政府制订最低工资制和批准国际劳工组织条约等。
    此外，会议还决定1月底在东京举行失业者中央大会，2月上旬举行“要求编制同社会保险有关的预算”大会。
    会议决定要加强地方的联合斗争，把全国分成六个地区，在九州北部和山口地方，四国地方，关西和东海地方，关东地方，北陆地方，东北和北海道地方分别成立六个地区联合斗争会议，来组织各地的春季斗争。
