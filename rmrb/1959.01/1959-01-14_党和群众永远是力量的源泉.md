The Party and the Masses Are Forever the Source of Strength
Xu Hongji, Chief Engineer of Tianjin Power Machine Factory

Since the Great Leap Forward, the many new things in our factory have deeply moved me.

At the end of September, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries assigned our factory an urgent production task to support the upcoming production of the Tianjin Steel Plant's Second Steelmaking Plant: to complete two large blowers with 400 horsepower, an air volume of 200 cubic meters, and a weight of seven tons within twelve days. At that time, the factory director was visiting the Soviet Union. As the chief engineer and deputy factory director, I couldn't sleep well all night after the higher authorities gave us this task. I thought: If we accept it, our factory has never made blowers before, we don't have specialized equipment, and it would take more than ten days to make a set of tooling. How can we make such large equipment in twelve days! If we don't accept it, it's a political task, how can we shrink back? I told the factory's Party Secretary about this idea. The Secretary said: "Of course, we must accept it. Whether we can complete it on time depends on whether we can mobilize the masses." Then, under the leadership of the Secretary, a factory-wide workers' meeting and workshop and group discussions were held to explain the situation to the masses, and many workers were eager to express "guarantee to complete on schedule!"

The task was undertaken, but I was still drumming in my heart. Because I knew that the spherical spindle of the blower needed to be processed on a large machine tool, but our factory did not have such a large lathe. What should we do? As a result, this problem was solved by an old worker named Chen Hanming (now appointed as a technician) in one sentence. He said: "Process it in two steps." Although the reasoning is simple, it solves the problem very well. When the blower was about to be completed, when casting the metal tiles, because the thickness of the casting was too large, the young foundry workers cast one bad one. Later, I found the old fitter An Changling, who had cast similar metal tiles in 1950. He said, "Engineer Xu, don't worry, I'll take care of this casting task!" On October 10, we gloriously completed this political task. Last year, I experienced many such things. Every time I went through it, my understanding became deeper. As an engineering and technical personnel, if you are separated from the leadership of the Party and the support of the workers, even if you have great skills, you will not play a positive role in production.

I am an old intellectual, with some book knowledge, and I have been engaged in mechanical manufacturing for more than ten years. In the past few years, although I knew that the leadership of the Party was important, I still retained certain opinions when it came to some technical issues; especially the idea of ​​not trusting the masses in technology was more obvious. Because the technical research work was limited to a small number of technical personnel, and the technical personnel did not dare to go beyond the existing literature, some new products and new processes designed in the past often remained at the level of "armchair strategists" for a long time. After the rectification movement, especially the facts that the workers dared to think and act, broke through my conservative thinking.

Last spring, when our factory discussed the Great Leap Forward plan, I made a bold suggestion: while ensuring that the annual output of diesel engines doubled, we should try to manufacture a new type of diesel engine that only a few countries in the world can currently manufacture. After the factory's Party Committee carefully studied the content of this proposal, it actively supported it. To this end, the factory director went to Shanghai to collect information and sent people to Beijing to invite experts to design with us; the factory's employees broke through the difficulties of no tooling and no process regulations, and actively participated in the research and trial production. After three months of hard work, this new type of diesel engine began to be installed at the end of July. At this time, I was very excited, and I didn't feel sleepy even if I didn't sleep for two or three nights in a row.

What I will never forget is the moment when this new type of diesel engine was tested after it was assembled. Under my command, it was driven by an old worker. Due to our excessive tension and lack of experience in operating it, an operational error caused the key components of this diesel engine, two pistons, to be damaged. At that time, we were both very heavyhearted. The Party Secretary and the factory director who were present immediately said to us: This is a new thing, setbacks are inevitable. Then, the Party Committee held an emergency meeting, calling on all workshops and groups to do their best to support the trial production of new products. After another three days of hard work, this new type of diesel engine was finally successfully trial-produced.

Afterwards, I said to another engineer: "If it weren't for this era and our social system, who could offer such a large price to support the trial production of this new product?"

Since then, our courage has become even greater, and we have independently designed two newer and larger internal combustion engines in conjunction with the factory's workers and experts from other places. Now one has been successfully trial-produced and the other is being installed. In 1958, our factory successfully trial-produced 25 new products, and new process technologies were put into production, taking a big step forward on the road to advancing towards the world's advanced science and technology. This is the victory of the general line of socialist construction, the creation of all the factory's employees. Our engineering and technical personnel have also gained greater confidence and strength under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the workers.

    党和群众永远是力量的源泉
    天津动力机厂总工程师　徐鸿济
    大跃进以来，我们工厂的许许多多新鲜事情，使我深深地受到了感动。
      9月底，天津市机电工业局分配给我们工厂一项紧急的生产任务，为了支援即将投入生产的天津钢厂第二炼钢厂；要在十二天内，完成两台四百匹马力、风量二百立方公尺、体重七吨的大型鼓风机。这时厂长正在苏联参观，我是总工程师，又是副厂长，上级向我们提出了这项任务以后，我一夜也没有睡好觉。心想：接受吧，我们厂从来也没做过鼓风机，没有专门设备，做一套工卡具也要十几天，现在做这么大的设备，十二天怎么能做得出来哩！不接受吧，这是政治任务，怎么能退缩呢？我把这种想法告诉了工厂的党委书记。书记说：“当然要接受，能否按时完成，就看我们能不能把群众发动起来”。接着在书记的主持下，召开了全厂的职工大会和车间、小组的讨论会，向群众交清了“底”，很多工人摩拳擦掌地表示“保证按期完成！”
    任务承担下来了，但是我心里头还是打着鼓。因为我知道鼓风机上的球形主轴，需要在大型的机床上加工，而我们工厂没有这么大的车床，怎么办呢？结果这个难题被一个叫陈汉明的老工人（现已被任命为技师）一句话就点破了。他说：
  “分成两步加工”。道理虽然简单，可是非常解决问题。鼓风机快要做成了，浇铸五金瓦的时候，由于铸件的厚度太大，年轻的铸工们铸一个坏一个。后来我找到了老钳工安长岭，他在1950年曾铸过类似的五金瓦。他说：“徐工程师，你放心，这个浇铸的任务我包啦！”10月10日，我们光荣地完成了这一政治任务。去年这一年，我经历过许多次像这样的事情。经过一次，就使我的体会更深刻，做为一个工程技术人员，如果离开了党的领导，离开了工人群众的支持，即使你有天大的本领，也不会在生产上发挥积极作用的。
    我是个旧知识分子，有些书本知识，也搞过十几年的机械制造。过去几年虽然也知道党的领导重要，但是在牵涉到一些技术问题上，自己仍保留着一定的看法；尤其是在技术上不相信群众的思想更为明显。由于把技术研究工作局限在少数技术人员的范围内，技术人员的思想又不敢超越已有文献一步，因此过去设计的一些新产品和新工艺往往长期停留在“纸上谈兵”上。经过整风运动，尤其是职工们敢想敢干的事实，冲破了我的保守思想。
    去年春天我们工厂讨论跃进计划的时候，我曾提出一个大胆的建议：在保证柴油机的年产量翻一番的同时，我们要试制出当前国际上只有少数国家能制造的某种新型柴油机。工厂党委会详细研究了这个建议的内容以后，积极支持了这个建议。为此，厂长曾到上海搜集资料，并派人到北京邀请专家和我们共同设计；全厂职工突破没有工卡具，没有工艺规程的困难，积极参加研究试制。经过了三个月的苦战，在7月底这架新型的柴油机开始安装了。这时候我的心情十分激动，一连两三夜不睡觉，也不觉得困。
    最使我难忘的，是这种新型柴油机装成后试车的一刹那。在我的指挥下，由一个老工人开车。由于我们过分地紧张和对它还缺乏操纵的经验，一个操作上的错误，使这部柴油机的关键部件两个活塞撞坏了。当时我们两人的心情是十分沉重的。在场的党委书记和厂长立即对我们说：这是一种新东西，挫折是在所难免的。接着，党委会召开了紧急会议，号召各车间、小组尽力支援新产品的试制。又经过三天的苦干，这架新型的柴油机终于试制成功了。
    事后我曾向另一个工程师说：
  “如果不是在这个时代、在我们这个社会制度里，谁能拿出这样大的代价，来支持这种新产品的试制呢？”
    从此，我们的胆子就更大了，又与本厂工人和外地专家结合独立地设计了两种更新更大的内燃机。现在有一种已试制成功，另一种正在安装。1958年我们工厂试制成功的新产品，有二十五种新的工艺技术投入了生产，在向世界先进科学技术进军的道路上大大地前进了一步。这是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是全厂职工的创造，我们工程技术人员也在党的领导下，在工人的支持下增添了更大的信心和力量。
