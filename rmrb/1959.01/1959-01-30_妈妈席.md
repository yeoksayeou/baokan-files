    Mama Seating
    By our reporter Meng Fanqin

    I was touched to hear that the Xiaoxi Dining Hall in the Miao village of the Dongfanghong People's Commune in Jishou, Hunan, takes good care of breastfeeding mothers, and that the babies are all chubby. On January 20th, I made a special trip to visit this dining hall.

    When I arrived, it was time for dinner. Upon closer inspection, this dining hall was indeed different: the ten breastfeeding mothers were grouped together at a table called "Mama Seating." In addition to the dishes, "Mama Seating" had a large bowl of steaming soup, more than the regular tables. The mothers were eating with relish, chatting and laughing. Long Xiuzhen, the director of the County Women's Federation, told me that "Mama Seating" had been running for over a month, and the mothers reported that their milk supply had increased. Every day after work, the children would gulp down the milk. The mothers also cared for and supported each other. After work, they would go to the nursery to breastfeed together and eat together in the dining hall. If someone didn't come to eat, everyone would save a portion of food and keep it warm in the pot. A few days ago, Shi Dongmei had a large sore on her leg, and Long Dongmei brought her food every day.

    The story of "Mama Seating" has a history. It turns out that in order to effectively solve the problem of milk shortage for children, Long Xiuzhen, the director of the County Women's Federation, and Wu Yaoyu, a cadre of the Women's Federation, came to Xiaoxi Dining Hall to cultivate a "test field." During the day, they worked as cooks, and in the evening, they held discussions with the Miao mothers who were breastfeeding, listening to their opinions and requests. Long Dongchun said, "Those of us with children just want our children to have enough milk, and then we can feel at ease." Long Erjie said, "We don't need special care, just more soup." Based on the mothers' opinions, the commune members were organized to discuss the question: "Should breastfeeding mothers be taken care of?" The result of the discussion was a unanimous decision to establish "Mama Seating" to allow the mothers to eat better and produce more milk.

    I also went to the nursery. Aunt Shi Jiamei was holding a plump, white six-month-old baby and happily said to me, "This is Long Dongmei's child. Before, she didn't have enough milk, and he cried every day. He was hard to take care of, but now he rarely cries all day long." Long Erying, who was breastfeeding, said gratefully, "This world is so good, my child is really blessed!" Looking at these chubby babies, I also thought: Children born in the Mao Zedong era are so happy!

    Long Erjie's husband, Hong Silin, was working on the Yuejin Reservoir. Before, he was at the construction site, but he often worried about his six-month-old child at home who didn't have enough milk, and he always wanted to ask for leave to go home and see. Later, when he heard that the dining hall was taking such good care of breastfeeding mothers, he felt relieved, and he was determined to finish building the reservoir before going home.

    妈妈席
    本报记者  孟繁勤
    听说湖南吉首东方红人民公社苗寨小溪食堂对喂奶的母亲照顾周到，婴儿个个长得胖呼呼的，这件事打动了我的心。元月20日，我特地去访问了这个食堂。
    我到的时候，正遇上开晚饭。仔细一看，这个食堂确实有些不同的地方：喂奶的十个母亲编在一起，叫“妈妈席”。“妈妈席”上除了菜外，比一般席上多一大钵热气腾腾的汤。母亲们吃得津津有味，有说有笑。县妇联主任龙秀珍告诉我，“妈妈席”已经办了一个多月，母亲们都反映奶水比过去多了，每天散工回来，孩子们咕噜咕噜地吃着奶。母亲之间，更是互相关心、体贴，散工后，一起到托儿所喂奶，一起上食堂吃饭。吃饭时，要是哪个没来，大家便会把菜留一份出来热在锅里。前些日子，石冬妹腿上长了个大疮，龙冬妹每天都给她送饭。
    说起“妈妈席”，可有段来历。原来，为了切实解决孩子的缺奶问题，县妇联主任龙秀珍和妇联干部吴耀玉来到小溪食堂搞“试验田”。她们白天当炊事员，晚上和喂奶的苗家母亲座谈，听取她们的意见和要求。龙冬春说：“我们有孩子的人只要孩子有奶吃，心就落地了。”龙二姐说：“我们也不要特殊照顾，只要多喝点汤汤水水。”根据母亲们的意见，组织社员进行讨论，讨论的题目是：“喂奶的母亲应不应照顾？”讨论的结果，一致主张开办“妈妈席”，让母亲们吃得好一点，多发奶水。
    我又到托儿所去看了看。阿姨石家妹抱着一个六个月大的又白又胖的婴儿，高兴地对我说：“这是龙冬妹的孩子，以前奶水不够吃，天天哇哇地哭，数他不好带，现在一天到晚难得哭一声。”正在喂奶的龙二英感激地说：“这个世道太好了，我的孩子真是享福呀！”我望着这些胖呼呼的婴孩，心里也想：生在毛泽东时代的孩子真是太幸福了！
    龙二姐的爱人洪四林在修跃进水库，以前人在工地，心里却时常念着家里缺奶的六个月的小孩，老想请假回家看看。以后听说食堂对喂奶的母亲照顾得这样好，也就安心了，他决心修好水库再回家。
