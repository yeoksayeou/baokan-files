From the perspective of making new shoes

The widespread implementation of free meals in rural areas, with no need to worry about food, is a great thing. Since the beginning of winter, many communes have organized sewing groups to rush-produce cotton clothes and trousers for the farmers, so there's no need to worry about clothing, which is another good thing. Now, the Meishan Commune is arranging time for the female commune members to make new shoes and clothes, so they can happily celebrate the Spring Festival, which, of course, is yet another good thing. These good things, linked together one by one, demonstrate the superiority of the People's Commune. Only it can provide the material conditions for our farmers to satisfy these needs, and only it is the organizer of the people's production and life.

    由做新鞋想起
    广大农村实行吃饭不要钱，食不用愁了，这是一件大好事。入冬以后，许多公社又组织缝纫组给农民突击添制棉衣、棉裤，穿又不用愁了，这又是一件好事。现在，煤山公社又给女社员安排时间，让她们去做新鞋新衣，以便高高兴兴过春节，这，当然又是一件好事。这些好事一件一件地联系起来，可以看到人民公社的优越性，只有它才给我国农民带来了满足这些需要的物质条件，也只有它才是人民的生产和生活的组织者。
