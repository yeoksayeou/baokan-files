    A Good Omen in the Art World
    In a back-cover advertisement of a periodical, I saw that the People's Fine Arts Publishing House has recently published many collections of fine art works, including "The Collection of Farmer Paintings from Pixian County, Jiangsu," "The Collection of Farmer Paintings from Zunhua County, Hebei," "The Collection of Farmer Paintings from Fuyang County, Anhui," and "The Collection of Mass Art Works from Shulu County, Hebei Province." Such a concentrated publication of fine art collections by workers and peasants was rare in the past. This is a new and gratifying phenomenon in the publishing industry.
    However, what is commendable is not only this. I paid special attention to the prices of these collections. The lowest is 14 cents, and the highest is only 25 cents. Each book selects dozens of paintings, and the pricing is undeniably very cheap.
    In the general readers' impression, the pricing of fine art books and periodicals is relatively high. The collections of fine artists are also exquisitely bound, often costing four or five yuan per volume. Even some mass art collections, such as "Selected Yangliuqing New Year Pictures," cost more than three yuan a copy, leaving the masses only able to sigh longingly at the books.
    Now that the publishing house has taken this into consideration, it shows that they wholeheartedly want to put fine art publications into the hands of readers, that they have a mass viewpoint, and are willing to serve the masses.
    Recently, the 1957 cartoon collection of cartoonist Hua Junwu was published, and the price is only 18 cents. This shows that artists are also willing to dedicate their art to the broad masses, rather than insisting that only grand and luxurious versions can be published.
    The publishing house is producing reasonably priced collections of mass works on a large scale, and artists are willing to popularize their works among the masses on a wider scale. This is a very good "omen," and it foreshadows that the already prosperous art world will become even more prosperous!

    画坛上的好兆头
    在一本期刊的封底广告上，我看到人民美术出版社最近出版了许多美术作品选集，其中有江苏邳县农民画集、河北遵化农民画集、安徽阜阳农民画集和河北省束鹿县的群众美术作品选集。这样集中的出版工农群众的美术作品选集，在以往还是少有的，这是出版界出现的新气象，可喜可贺。
    然而，可贺的还不止此。我特别注意了这些画集的定价，最低的一角四分钱，最高的也不过二角五分钱。每本都选画数十幅，定价不能不说很便宜了。
    在一般读者的印象中，美术书刊的定价是比较高的。美术家的选集也都装帧得极为讲究，动不动就要四、五元一册，即或是一些群众性的画集，如“杨柳青年画选”之类也要三元多一本，群众只能望书兴叹。
    现在出版社考虑到这一点，说明他们是一心想把美术出版物送到读者的手中，是有群众观点的，愿意为群众服务的。
    最近漫画家华君武的1957年的漫画选集出版了，定价也才一角八分钱。这说明美术家们也是愿意把自己的艺术献给广大群众的，而不是斤斤于非出版堂皇豪华的版本不可。
    出版社大出其定价公道的群众作品集，美术家们愿意把自己的作品在更大的范围内普及给群众，这是一种很好的“兆头”，它预示了一片繁荣气象的画坛上将会更加繁荣起来！
