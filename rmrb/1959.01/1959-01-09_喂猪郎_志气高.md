The pig feeder has lofty aspirations.
Extracting treasure from the pig's body, finding gold in the manure, changing the old appearance of the factory.
The slaughterhouse is not simple, its potential power is boundless.
"Pigs in, meat out" is a thing of the past, comprehensive utilization is now realized.
With the Party's leadership, hard work plus research, what difficulty is there in "eating pork for free"!

　　×　×　×
The future of our factory is truly limitless, the more I think about it, the more I love it.
Determined, resolved, I will make the Second Factory my home and be with the pigs.

    喂猪郎　志气高喂猪郎，志气高。猪身取宝，粪里淘金，改变工厂旧面貌。屠宰场，不简单，潜在力量大无边，“进猪出肉”成过去，综合利用今实现。党领导，干加钻“猪肉白吃”有何难！
    ×　×　×我厂远景真无限，越想越爱喜心间。下决心，立志愿，二厂为家猪作伴。
