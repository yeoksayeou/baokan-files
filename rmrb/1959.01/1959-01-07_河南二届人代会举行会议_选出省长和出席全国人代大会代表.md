Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 3rd: The Second Henan Provincial People's Congress held its first session from December 28th to 31st, 1958.

Two days of preparatory meetings were held before the formal opening of the conference, during which all delegates earnestly studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

The meeting heard six reports, including the "Work Report of the Henan Provincial People's Committee" by Henan Governor Wu Zhipu, and the "Explanation on the Draft Economic Construction Plan of Henan Province for 1959" by Deputy Governor Zhao Wenfu. In his report, Wu Zhipu talked about the achievements of the all-round Great Leap Forward in Henan Province over the past year. He said that in 1958, Henan Province achieved a comprehensive and unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. The total grain output of the province increased by 1.85 times compared with 1957, and the total cotton output increased by 1.7 times compared with 1957. Other crops such as peanuts, sesame, cured tobacco, silk, medicinal materials, hemp, and tea also experienced significant growth. In terms of industrial production, a surge of the whole Party and the entire people undertaking industry and steel production emerged throughout the province. It is estimated that the total industrial output value increased by 177.6% compared with 1957; the proportion of total industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 28.4% in 1957 to 32.6%. Great achievements have also been made in finance and trade, culture and education, and politics and law. Due to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the rapid development of social productive forces, and the rapid improvement of the socialist and communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses, the entire province achieved people's commune-ization by the end of August. Wu Zhipu pointed out that the achievement of these successes was the result of implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction and the mass line, and the result of successfully carrying out the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle.

When talking about the new tasks for 1959, Wu Zhipu pointed out that 1959 is a crucial year for the three years of hard struggle. Under the unified national plan, the scale of socialist construction in Henan Province will be larger than in 1958. In order to strive for greater victories in 1959, it is necessary to continue to oppose Right-leaning conservative ideas, summon up our energy, and advance victoriously on the basis of the great victories and rich experience gained in 1958. At the same time, we must combine revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts and scientific analysis, continue to implement the Party's general line of building socialism; continue to adhere to the principle of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, and rationally arrange the work for 1959; and continue to implement the principle of putting politics in command, relying on the masses, and launching mass movements on a large scale. At present, it is necessary to seize the opportunity and earnestly do a good job in the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the people's communes. In this way, 1959 will surely achieve a greater leap forward than 1958.

All the delegates earnestly and enthusiastically discussed this report and unanimously adopted a resolution approving the above report. The resolution specifically pointed out that the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the people's communes is the key to completing the various tasks of 1959, and that the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party is the guide for future actions, a sharp weapon for unifying understanding and improving thinking, and the criterion for rectifying, consolidating, and improving the people's communes. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses before the end of May and conduct a comprehensive and systematic rectification of the people's communes from the aspects of ideology, production, life, and management. In the process of rectifying the communes, it is first necessary to earnestly study the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and use this as the central content of carrying out the socialist and communist education movement, and launch a wide-ranging and in-depth propaganda and study movement. The resolution also pointed out that developing production is the central link in consolidating and improving the people's communes. While grasping production, it is also necessary to grasp the people's lives. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to implement the principle of industry and agriculture running side by side and the principle of combining self-sufficiency production and commodity production, in accordance with the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, and in accordance with the principle of running the communes diligently and thriftily, so as to comprehensively develop the industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fisheries of the people's communes. We must continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward, vigorously carry out the rectification and improvement of steel bases, vigorously develop commune-run industries, actively develop diversified economies, and increase commune income. At the same time, we must quickly launch an agricultural production campaign centered on wheat field management to ensure a greater bumper harvest of wheat in 1959. On the other hand, a comprehensive and in-depth review of the people's livelihood issues must be conducted, and collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, maternity hospitals, and health clinics must be earnestly managed well.

The meeting elected Wu Zhipu as the Governor of Henan Province, Zhao Wenfu, Xing Zhaotang, Ji Wenfu, Jia Xinzhai, Qi Wenjian, Li Qingwei, Wang Weiqun, Zhang Baiyuan, Peng Xiaoqian, and Shao Wenpi as the ten Deputy Governors, Wang Zimuo and forty-two others as members of the Provincial People's Committee, and Wang Guangli as the President of the Henan Provincial Higher People's Court by secret ballot. The meeting also elected the presidents of the Intermediate People's Courts of the six special districts of Xuchang, Xinxiang, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Nanyang, and Xinyang. The meeting also elected fifty-six delegates from Henan Province to attend the Second National People's Congress.

    河南二届人代会举行会议
    选出省长和出席全国人代大会代表
    新华社郑州3日电　河南省在1958年12月28日到31日举行了第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。
    在会议正式开幕以前的两天预备会议中，全体代表认真地学习了党的八届六中全会文件。
    会议听取了河南省省长吴芝圃作的“河南省人民委员会工作报告”和副省长赵文甫作的“关于河南省1959年经济建设计划草案的说明”等六个报告。吴芝圃在报告中谈到了河南省一年来全面大跃进所取得的成就。他说，1958年河南省在农业生产方面获得了全面的空前的大丰收，全省粮食总产量比1957年增长了一点八五倍，棉花总产量比1957年增长了一点七倍。其他如花生、芝麻、烤烟、蚕丝、药材、麻类、茶叶等也都有很大增长。在工业生产方面，全省出现了全党全民大办工业和大办钢铁的热潮，预计工业总产值比1957年增长177.6％；工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重，由1957年的28.4％增长到32.6％。在财贸、文教、政法等方面也都取得了很大成就。由于工农业生产的大跃进，社会生产力的猛烈发展以及广大群众的社会主义和共产主义思想觉悟的迅速提高，全省在8月底就实现了人民公社化。吴芝圃指出，这些成就的取得，是由于贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和群众路线的结果，是胜利地开展整风运动和反右派斗争的结果。
    在谈到1959年新的工作任务时，吴芝圃指出，1959年是苦战三年带有决定意义的一年，在全国统一计划下，河南省社会主义建设的规模将比1958年更大。为了争取1959年更大的胜利，必须在1958年取得的伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，继续反对右倾保守思想，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进。同时还必须把革命热情和实事求是科学分析的精神结合起来，继续贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线；继续坚持以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针，合理地安排1959年的工作；继续实行政治挂帅，依靠群众，大搞群众运动的方针。当前要抓紧时机，认真作好人民公社的整顿、巩固和提高工作。这样，1959年一定会比1958年获得更大的跃进。
    全体代表认真地热烈地讨论了这个报告，并一致通过了同意上述报告的决议。决议特别指出，整顿、巩固和提高人民公社是完成1959年各项工作任务的关键，而党的八届六中全会决议则是今后行动的指南，是统一认识提高思想的锐利武器，是整顿、巩固和提高人民公社的准则，因此，必须在5月底以前充分发动群众，普遍地从思想上、生产上、生活上、经营管理上对人民公社进行一次全面的系统的整顿。在整社过程中，首先要认真学习党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，并以此作为开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动的中心内容，开展一个广泛深入的宣传学习运动。决议并指出发展生产是巩固、提高人民公社的中心环节。在抓好生产的同时，还必须抓好人民生活。因此，一方面要根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工业和农业并举、自给性生产和商品性生产并举的方针，将人民公社的工业、农业、林业、牧业、副业和渔业全面地发展起来。要继续执行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，大力进行钢铁基地的整顿和提高工作，大办公社工业，积极发展多种经济，增加公社收入。同时迅速掀起以麦田管理为中心的农业生产运动，保证1959年小麦更大丰收。另一方面要对人民生活问题进行一次全面深入的大检查，认真办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、妇产院和卫生院等集体福利事业。
    会议以无记名投票的方式，选举吴芝圃为河南省省长，赵文甫、邢肇棠、嵇文甫、贾心斋、齐文俭、李庆伟、王维群、张柏园、彭笑千、邵文丕等十人为副省长，王子谟等四十二人为省人民委员会委员、王光力为河南省高级人民法院院长；并选举了许昌、新乡、洛阳、开封、南阳、信阳等六个专区的中级人民法院院长。会议还选出河南省出席第二届全国人民代表大会代表五十六人。他们是：邓颖超（女）尹达、王志杰、王少堂、王化云、刘英（女）、刘名榜、刘鸿文、刘宴春、刘九学、刘文树（女）、邢肇棠、孙香云（女）、李雪峰、李世璋、李俨、李赋都、杜延庆、杜孟模、陈凤桐、汪菊潜、何泽慧（女）、苏殿选、吴作人、吴芝圃、林砺儒、屈武、秉志、赵树理、赵文甫、徐子荣、郭则沉、袁慧灼、侯德原、高镇五、马豫真、康克清（女）、曹靖华、张伯声、常香玉（女）、贺升平、贾拓夫、贾心斋、曾传六、须恺、嵇文甫、傅子诚、杨显东、杨钟健、杨纯（女）、杨廷宝、鲁定华、钱端有、霍秉权、谢为杰、魏巍。
