Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Havana dispatch: Trials of Batista criminals by the Havana court in the Cuban capital were held on the 22nd at the Sports City stadium. Thirty thousand spectators packed the venue, which only had fifteen thousand seats. Several thousand more stood in the nearby streets.

The "Three-Man Revolutionary Tribunal," presided over by Humberto Sori Marin, the chief military prosecutor of the Cuban Provisional Government, handled the trials.

Reportedly, the first criminal to be tried was Sosa, a reactionary officer of the Batista regime, who confessed to killing one hundred and eight people. He was the former army commander of the Holguin region in Oriente Province. When this blood-soaked murderer was brought to court, the crowd roared with anger, whistles blew throughout the court, and there was a unanimous demand for the suppression of this criminal. According to witness accusations, Sosa had committed heinous crimes of mass murder, torture, and torment of the masses. During the trial, this executioner even attempted to deny his crimes and requested a change of venue. Sosa's denials aroused the immense anger of the masses, and the court rejected his request.

The work of trying the criminals continues. It is reported that more than one hundred former government naval personnel are awaiting trial, including former Vice Admiral Casanova.

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Havana dispatch: Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro reiterated at a press conference held in the capital Havana on the 22nd that those criminals with glaring crimes must be resolutely punished. He said, "The trials and executions of war criminals will be completed as quickly as possible, the sooner the better."

Castro also reaffirmed the necessity of a "thorough review of the privileges that the Batista dictatorship granted to American and other foreign capital." He emphasized that this work is "part of the revolution." In his remarks, Castro reiterated that he is not a communist, while also clearly stating that "Cuban communists will not be persecuted."

Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd, Washington dispatch: Despite the Cuban government's request that the United States extradite all Batista fugitives it has taken in, this legitimate demand has been rejected. The US State Department announced on the 22nd that the US government will not extradite Cuban "asylum seekers" to the Cuban Provisional Government for "trials for political crimes."

    不向美国干涉低头　坚决惩治人民公敌
    古巴公审罪恶昭彰的杀人犯
    美国政府竟无理拒绝交出古巴逃犯
    新华社23日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴首都哈瓦那法庭对巴蒂斯塔罪犯的审判工作22日在体育城运动场举行。三万个旁听者挤满了这个仅仅有一万五千席位的地方。有好几千人还伫立在附近的街道上。
    古巴临时政府首席军事审判官翁伯托·索里·马林主持的“三人革命法庭”受理这次审判工作。
    据报道，第一个受审的罪犯是巴蒂斯塔政权的反动军官索萨，他曾自供杀死过一百零八个人。他是奥连特省奥尔金地区的前政府陆军司令。当这个血债累累的杀人犯被押到法庭上的时候，群众愤怒地吼叫了起来，法庭上哨声四起，一致要求镇压这个罪犯。据见证人的控告，索萨曾经大批屠杀、拷打和折磨群众，犯有令人发指的罪行。这个刽子手在审判的进程中，还企图抵赖自己的罪行，并要求迁移审判地点。索萨的狡赖引起了群众的无比愤怒，法庭拒绝了他的要求。
    审判罪犯的工作在继续进行中。据报道，有一百多名前政府海军人员在等待审判，其中包括前任海军中将卡萨诺瓦。
    新华社23日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗22日在首都哈瓦那举行的记者招待会上再一次强调，必须坚决惩办那些罪恶昭彰的罪犯。他说，“对战犯的审判和处决将尽速完成，越快越好”。
    卡斯特罗并且重审有必要对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权“出让给美国和其他外国资本的特权进行彻底审查”。他强调指出，这项工作是“革命的一部分”。卡斯特罗在谈话中再次表明，他不是一个共产党员，同时，他又明确表示，“古巴的共产党人将不会受到迫害”。
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：尽管古巴政府要求美国把它收容下来的一切巴蒂斯塔逃犯引渡回来，但是这种正当要求已经遭到拒绝。美国国务院22日宣布，美国政府将不把古巴“避难”者引渡给古巴临时政府进行“政治罪行的审判”。
