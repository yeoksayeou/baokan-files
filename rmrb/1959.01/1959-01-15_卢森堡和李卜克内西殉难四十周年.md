    Fortieth Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Luxemburg and Liebknecht
    Above are two paragraphs from a letter written by Rosa Luxemburg, leader of the German workers' movement, to her friend Sonja from prison. Rosa Luxemburg was murdered by German reactionaries on January 15, 1919. Another German revolutionary leader, Karl Liebknecht, also sacrificed himself at the same time.
    Forty years ago, these two outstanding revolutionaries led German workers in an unyielding struggle against imperialism and militarism. During their lifetime, although they were repeatedly oppressed by counter-revolutionary forces and imprisoned, they were infinitely loyal to the cause of the liberation of the working class and full of confidence in the inevitable victory of the socialist revolution. Therefore, even in prison, they fully demonstrated the revolutionary optimism of proletarian fighters, writing many leaflets, essays, and letters, transmitting their voices from behind bars, and tirelessly fighting against the enemy.

    卢森堡和李卜克内西殉难四十周年
    上面是德国工人运动的领袖罗莎·卢森堡在狱中写给她的好友宋娅的信中的两段。罗莎·卢森堡是在1919年1月15日被德国的反动派杀害的。与她同时牺牲的，还有另一位德国的革命领袖卡尔·李卜克内西。
    四十年前，这两位杰出的革命家领导了德国工人同帝国主义和军国主义进行了不屈不挠的斗争。在他们生前，虽然屡次遭到反革命势力的压迫，并且被捕入狱过，但是由于他们对工人阶级解放事业的无限忠诚，对社会主义革命必定胜利充满了信心，所以即使在狱中也充分表现了无产阶级战士的革命乐观主义精神，写了不少传单、论文和书信，把他们的声音从铁窗里传出来，从不停息地同敌人作斗争。（附图片）
