Supplement What's Lacking; Grasp the Two Ends and Bring Along the Middle
Shanxi Meticulously Manages Wheat Fields

    This newspaper Taiyuan, 12th dispatch: People's communes in the winter wheat region of Shanxi Province, based on the principle of "supplement what's lacking," are adopting the method of grasping the two ends and bringing along the middle to continue deepening and meticulously strengthening wheat field management.

    Currently, thanks to the efforts of 1.12 million people managing wheat fields in Shanxi Province, over 1.34 million mu of winter wheat have been irrigated, and over 5.37 million mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer, accounting for 50% of the province's wheat fields. Furthermore, 2.3 million mu of winter wheat have been processed and compacted. People's communes in various regions have paid attention to the work method of grasping the two ends and bringing along the middle during wheat field processing and management, prioritizing large-area high-yield fields, basic farmland, and third-class seedlings, followed by general fields. Many people's communes have managed and processed wheat fields meticulously. In Wenxi County, some people's communes have finely harrowed wheat fields three times, and in addition to harrowing the high-yield fields with iron rakes, they have also channelized each wheat field. Currently, third-class seedlings account for about 10% of the total wheat field area in the province. Many places have given these third-class seedlings similar "treatment" as large-area high-yield fields—"eating preferential meals."

    In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year, people's communes in various regions have further improved the processing and management of wheat fields. Specialized wheat field management teams have been established in various regions, and many people's communes have also established wheat management archives, with cards for recording wheat growth conditions, to facilitate summarizing experiences and mastering wheat growth patterns. After establishing the wheat archive system, Shiyou County formed a wheat management responsibility network of "every plot has personnel, everyone is responsible, and no detail is missed." Currently, all regions in the province are pushing wheat field management to a new high tide. (Cheng Lijia)

    缺什么补什么　抓两头带中间
    山西细致管理麦田
    本报太原12日电　山西省冬麦区人民公社最近根据“缺什么，补什么”的原则，采用抓两头、带中间的办法，继续深入细致地加强麦田管理。
    目前，山西省在一百一十二万麦田管理大军的努力下，已浇灌冬小麦一百三十四万多亩，追肥五百三十七万多亩，占全省麦田的50％；并且已有二百三十万亩冬小麦经过加工镇压。各地人民公社在麦田加工管理中，都注意了先大面积丰产田、基本农田和三类苗，后一般田的抓两头带中间的工作方法。许多人民公社的麦田管理加工的很细致。闻喜县人民公社有部分麦田已细耙过三遍，丰产田除用铁耙耙过以外，还使每块麦田渠畦化。目前全省三类苗占麦田总面积的10％左右。对这些三类苗，很多地方都给了与大面积高产田类似的“待遇”——“吃偏饭”。
    为争取今年小麦大丰收，各地人民公社都进一步改进了麦田的加工管理。各地都建立了麦田管理专业队，很多人民公社还建立了小麦管理档案，档案里设置了记录小麦生长情况的卡片，便于总结经验，掌握小麦生长规律。石楼县在建立了小麦档案制度以后，组成了“块块有兵、人人负责、点点不漏”的小麦管理责任网。现在，全省各地正把麦田管理推向新的高潮。　（程理嘉）
