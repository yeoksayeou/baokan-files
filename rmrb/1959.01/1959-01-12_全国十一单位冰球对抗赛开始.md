Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 11th. The 1959 National Eleven-Unit Ice Hockey Tournament began in Qiqihar on the 11th. Participating in the competition are 118 athletes from Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Yanbian and the Shenyang Air Force. The competition is expected to last seven days and will be conducted using a round-robin and re-circulation format.

Five matches were held on the opening day.

Among them, the defending ice hockey champion Harbin team played against the Tianjin team. From the start, the Harbin team used its absolute advantage of speed, power, and mature tactics to keep the Tianjin team under intense pressure. Using tactics such as quick cuts and close, coordinated short passes, they defeated the Tianjin team with an absolute advantage of twenty-seven to zero.

The battle between last year's runner-up, the Beijing team, and the Shenyang team was very intense. The Beijing team, known for its tacit cooperation and skillful technique, ended the first period with a score of four to three. However, at the start of the second period, the Shenyang team launched a counterattack, scoring consecutive goals in less than a minute, reaching four to three. The Shenyang team suddenly launched a fierce attack, putting great pressure on the Beijing team. In the blink of an eye, the Shenyang team fired a powerful shot from inside the Beijing team's defensive zone, sending the puck into the net, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the audience. Subsequently, the two sides engaged in a prolonged fierce battle. In the final minutes, the Beijing team scored again, ending the second period with a score of five to four. In the third period, the Beijing team went all out and won with a score of eight to four.

In the afternoon, the Jilin team, which won third place in last year's ice hockey tournament, played against the Shenyang Air Force team. In response to the Jilin team's fierce attacks, the Shenyang Air Force team adopted a tight defense, preventing the Jilin team from getting opportunities to shoot the puck into the net. The Shenyang Air Force team, which has only two years of experience in ice hockey, demonstrated courageous and tenacious characteristics throughout the entire battle. In the end, the Jilin team defeated the Shenyang Air Force team with a score of two to one.

    全国十一单位冰球对抗赛开始
    新华社哈尔滨11日电　1959年全国十一个单位冰球对抗赛11日在齐齐哈尔举行。参加比赛的，有北京、天津、沈阳、长春、吉林、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯、延边等地和沈阳空军队的一百十八个运动员。这次比赛预计一共七天，将采取小组循环和再循环的比赛办法。
    开幕的第一天，进行了五场比赛。
    其中，去年冰球赛的冠军哈尔滨队对天津队，一开始，哈尔滨队就以速度快、威力大、战术成熟的绝对优势紧紧压住天津队，并以快速切入，密切配合短传等战术，以二十七比零的绝对优势战胜天津队。
    去年得亚军的北京队对沈阳队的一场战斗，十分激烈。北京队善于默契合作、技术熟练，曾以四比三的纪录结束第一局。但在第二局开始，沈阳队进行了反攻，在不到一分钟的时间连连射门奏效，达到四比三时，沈阳队突然猛攻，使北京队受到很大压力。转眼，沈阳队在北京队门前守区内劲射一球进网，观众热烈地喝采。此后，双方进行了长久激战，在终场前数分钟北京队又射进了一球，以五比四结束第二局。在第三局中，北京队一鼓作气，以八比四获胜。
    下午，有去年冰球赛获第三名的吉林队对沈阳空军队。针对吉林队的猛烈进攻，沈阳空军队采取严密防守，使吉林队得不到射球入门的机会。参加冰球运动只有二年历史的沈阳空军队，在整个战局中表现了勇猛顽强的特色。比赛结果，吉林队以二比一战胜沈阳空军队。
