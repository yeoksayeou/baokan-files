    The Seven-Year Plan and Prospects for Economic Cooperation Between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Union　F. Panov
    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy stipulates the comprehensive expansion and strengthening of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and its fraternal socialist countries. The Seven-Year Plan and the long-term plans of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other socialist countries signify a higher degree of development in the division of labor among socialist countries. The practice of coordinating production plans in the production sectors of decisive significance among socialist countries is increasingly expanding, and this coordination more fully demonstrates the superiority of the world socialist economic system.
    The further development of economic and scientific-technological cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will powerfully promote the further consolidation of each socialist country and the entire world socialist system. This cooperation will play a major role in ensuring that the world socialist system absolutely surpasses the world capitalist system in terms of material production, that is, in 1965, socialist countries will produce more than half of the world's industrial products.
    Historical experience shows that economic cooperation among socialist countries, based on the principles of complete equality and mutual assistance, will enable each country to more rationally and fully utilize its natural resources and develop its productive forces. On the other hand, it enables them to jointly strengthen the economic power of the entire world socialist system. Economic cooperation, like all other relations between fraternal countries, is a concrete manifestation of the great principles of proletarian internationalism.
    As everyone knows, the People's Democratic countries began socialist construction under different levels of economic development. Under capitalism, economically developed countries exploit economically underdeveloped countries. Imperialism has brought the antagonism between itself and the countries under its oppression to its peak, dividing the world into a small group of highly developed imperialist powers and a large number of colonies and dependencies without their own industries.
    In the world socialist system, there is no phenomenon of antagonism between countries. The people of all countries in the socialist camp are united in the common goal of building a new society and in the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism. The basis of international cooperation is the great principle of fraternal mutual assistance. Precisely because of this, the development and strengthening of cooperation among socialist countries is also the development and consolidation of the entire socialist system.
    Through the economic cooperation of socialist countries, underdeveloped fraternal countries can be helped to quickly catch up with developed fraternal countries in terms of technology and economy. Of course, countries with higher levels of economic development provide more assistance to other fraternal countries.
    N.S. Khrushchev pointed out in one of his speeches: "Our country helps other countries because we are communists, we are Marxists-Leninists, we are not closed-door people. We regard the cause of building socialism and communism as a great internationalist cause."
    The further and rapid development of all sectors of the Soviet national economy in the next seven years is of paramount importance for strengthening and expanding the Soviet Union's economic ties with all socialist countries. By the end of 1962, the Soviet Union will provide socialist countries with machinery and equipment for 462 industrial enterprises and 120 separate workshops, and will assist in the construction and installation of these enterprises and workshops to put them into production.
    The Soviet people are sincerely happy for the smooth and effective development of Sino-Soviet economic ties. The Soviet Union is helping China build 211 large-scale industrial enterprises. Not long ago, a technical assistance agreement was signed for the Soviet Union to help China build and expand a number of enterprises. The People's Republic of China accounts for nearly half of the total amount of machinery and equipment exported by the Soviet Union to socialist countries.
    The high-speed increase in commodity exchange particularly demonstrates the achievements of the economic relations between China and the Soviet Union. The total trade volume between the Soviet Union and China in 1950 was 2.306 billion rubles, while in 1957 it was 5.129 billion rubles. The share of industrial equipment imported by China from the Soviet Union is constantly increasing: 30.7% in 1955, 41.6% in 1956, and 50% in 1957. In 1958, the total trade volume between the Soviet Union and China increased significantly compared to 1957. The commodities exported by the Soviet Union to China are industrial equipment, various machines and devices, ferrous metals, petroleum products, and chemicals. The commodities obtained by the Soviet Union from China are non-ferrous metals and other various mineral products, light industrial products, various agricultural and livestock products, fruits, raw silk, and many other commodities. It should be particularly emphasized that, due to the achievements of China's industrial development, China's exports of machine-building products, especially shipbuilding products, to the Soviet Union are increasing.
    In April 1958, the Soviet Union and China signed a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This treaty laid a solid foundation for the further development of fruitful economic and scientific-technological cooperation between our two countries.
    Now, it is difficult to imagine that any People's Democratic country would not have economic ties with other socialist countries. Soviet ore and Polish coal are helping the European People's Democratic countries develop the ferrous metallurgy industry. The cooperation between Czechoslovakia and Hungary enables Czechoslovakia to establish its own aluminum manufacturing industry. The machines provided by the Soviet Union, as well as Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic, are playing a good role in China's industrialization process. On the Chinese side, certain types of equipment, non-ferrous metals, light industrial and food industrial products, and agricultural raw materials are also provided to fraternal socialist countries. The economic ties between Hungary and Romania have opened up prospects for Hungary to develop a natural gas processing industry. All these examples (and these examples are countless) illustrate that the world socialist economic system is playing an increasingly important role in the development of each socialist country.
    Life shows that the forms and scope of economic cooperation between socialist countries that were established in the past are no longer fully adapted to the current potential of the world socialist economic system. In particular, it should be pointed out that this situation sometimes occurs, such as unnecessary duplication of the construction of the same type of enterprise in various countries, and insufficient estimates of the needs of certain individual types of products in the socialist world market. The lack of necessary specialization hinders many countries from carrying out large-scale continuous production of certain products. All this is first and foremost detrimental to the economic development of countries with limited raw materials and human resources. Life itself shows the necessity of transitioning to new forms of economic cooperation, to a more detailed division of labor and a more rational arrangement of production among fraternal countries.
    The concrete manifestation of the development of the international division of labor in socialist countries is the coordinated consistency of the national economic plans of socialist countries and the specialization and cooperation in the production of the most important industrial and agricultural sectors of these countries.
    The coordinated consistency of the national economic plans of various countries can achieve significant results. It can promote the more rapid development of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and accelerate the growth of the power of the world socialist system.
    Joint efforts in developing the most important sectors of industry and agriculture, in the comprehensive utilization of water resources, and in solving the most important scientific and technological problems, can more effectively utilize raw material resources and productive forces within the entire socialist system, accelerate the speed of technological progress, reduce production costs, and expand the production of the most important types of industrial products. For example, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Mongolian People's Republic have jointly built a railway trunk line connecting these three countries. The Soviet Union and China are jointly building the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway. Our two fraternal countries are jointly preparing to solve major problems such as the comprehensive utilization of the water resources of the Heilongjiang River.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have begun the practical work of production specialization and cooperation, which is carried out on the basis of strictly taking into account the special interests of each country and the common interests of all countries in the socialist camp. In the activities of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in which the Soviet Union and the European People's Democratic countries participate, and through bilateral negotiations, the foundation for the planned division of labor among socialist countries is being established. In particular, agreements have been reached on the collaboration in the development plans of machine manufacturing, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, coal, oil, and chemical industries, and many other sectors of the national economy.
    It is obvious that the coordinated consistency of national economic plans will also determine other forms of economic cooperation to an increasing extent. The planned nature of foreign trade in socialist countries will be continuously improved. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev pointed out in the report outline "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1959-1965" to be submitted to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the volume of Soviet foreign trade with socialist countries in 1965 will increase by more than 50% compared to 1958, and the variety of commodities will be greatly expanded. The share of machinery and equipment exported by many socialist countries in their foreign trade will be expanded.
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the long-term economic development plans of the People's Republic of China and other fraternal countries show that scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries will be raised to a new and higher level. Mutual ties in science and technology, especially the collaboration of the scientific and technological work and planning and design organs of various countries, will be strengthened. In order to collectively formulate scientific research work plans and jointly solve the most important scientific problems, the joint efforts of the Academies of Sciences and scientific research institutes of socialist countries will be closer. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have signed a special agreement on scientific and technological cooperation. From 1958 to 1962, twelve of the most important scientific and technological problems will be jointly studied, and the direct ties between the scientific research organs of the two countries will be further strengthened. Socialist countries will move towards the peaks of world science and technology more quickly.
    In order to utilize all the advantages of the world socialist system, it is necessary to calculate the needs and supply potentials of the fraternal countries more fully and accurately. For example, the problem of developing the ferrous metallurgy industry in the European People's Democratic countries is one of the fundamental problems of socialist industrialization in these countries. As everyone knows, almost all of these countries do not have iron ore deposits or only have lean iron ore. The European People's Democratic countries also do not have many ores used for alloying - chromium, manganese, nickel, molybdenum. In recent years, the Soviet Union has stipulated that the growth of iron ore mining in Ukraine and the central region of the Russian Federation will reach such a level that it is sufficient to meet the needs of the metallurgy industry in the southern and central parts of the Soviet Union, and to supply iron ore to Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other European People's Democratic countries. The supply from the Soviet Union can save Poland from investing huge amounts of funds in mining low-quality ore. At the same time, Poland's long-term plan stipulates that it will fully develop coal mining in order to not only supply domestic needs, but also meet the needs of fraternal countries.
    Economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is constantly developing. Various forms of economic ties between the Soviet Union and these countries are developing year by year. During the next seven years, this economic tie will continue to develop. The Soviet Union will provide these countries with increasing quantities of machines, equipment, petroleum products, and other commodities. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will export mineral products, agricultural products, and processed industrial products to the Soviet Union.
    Analyzing the economic ties of the fraternal countries, it is clear that the characteristic of the international specialization of the world socialist system is that this specialization arises on the basis of the comprehensive multi-sector development of the economy of each country.
    During the next seven years, when hundreds of new factories, metallurgical complexes, mines, and power stations in many socialist countries are put into production, the connection between international specialization and the comprehensive economic development within each country will be more significant. The product production of these enterprises will increase rapidly, and the production will mainly have large-scale characteristics. Obviously, it is precisely under the conditions of mutual collaboration in the production of various types of products that such outstanding results are achieved, that labor productivity is greatly increased, that raw materials are saved, and that production expenses are greatly reduced.
    There is no doubt that in the economic cooperation of socialist countries, there is still a huge task ahead: to seek more rational ties in accordance with the direction of production specialization and cooperation, and in accordance with the direction of further strengthening planning within the scope of the mutual ties of fraternal countries. This is the common task of all countries in the socialist camp, in order to more fully and more rationally utilize the international division of labor to benefit the fraternal countries, and to more fully and effectively coordinate the interests of each country in the socialist camp and the interests of the entire world socialist camp.
    The development of cooperation among fraternal countries is the result of the conscious and planned activities of the working people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp led by the Communist Party and the Workers' Party. The grand plans for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries show that the more the working people in urban and rural areas are committed to the development of their own country's economy, the more beneficial it is to their mutual economic ties, and the faster the strength of the world socialist system grows.
    Now, the whole world knows that in the coming seven years, the development of the world socialist system will be faster than ever before, and the process of completely eliminating the temporary imbalance in the economic development of individual socialist countries will also be faster than ever before. The significance of cooperation among these countries in further developing productive forces will greatly increase.
    The comprehensive friendly cooperation and mutual assistance among the countries of the world socialist system with a population of one billion is an example of the unified world economy of the future arranged by the working class of all countries according to a unified plan, which Lenin once said. The policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and other Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries are major factors in the communist transformation of society and necessary conditions for further strengthening the unity of socialist countries.

    七年计划和苏联同人民民主国家经济合作的前景
    苏联　弗·潘诺夫
    在苏联发展国民经济的七年计划中，规定了全面扩大和加强苏联同社会主义兄弟国家的经济合作。七年计划和中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国以及其他社会主义国家的远景计划，标志着社会主义各国劳动分工更高程度的发展。社会主义各国在具有决定意义的生产部门使生产计划协同一致的作法越来越扩大了，这种协同一致更充分地表现出世界社会主义经济体系的优越性。
    苏联和人民民主国家的经济和科学技术合作的进一步发展，将有力地促进每一个社会主义国家以及整个世界社会主义体系的更加巩固。这种合作在保证世界社会主义体系在物质生产方面绝对超过世界资本主义体系，即在1965年社会主义国家将生产全世界工业产品的一半以上，将起重大作用。
    历史经验表明，建立在完全平等和互助原则上的社会主义国家的经济合作，将使每一个国家能够更合理和充分地利用自己的天然资源和发展生产力，另一方面又使它们能够共同努力加强整个世界社会主义体系的经济威力。经济合作也和兄弟国家的一切其他关系一样，是伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则的具体表现。
    大家知道，人民民主国家是在经济发展程度不同的情况下开始了社会主义建设的。在资本主义条件下，经济比较发达的国家剥削经济不发达的国家。帝国主义使得它自己同在它压迫下的国家之间的对抗达到了最高峰，把世界分为一小撮高度发展的帝国主义强国和没有自己的工业、为数众多的殖民地和附属国。
    在世界社会主义体系中，各国之间没有敌对现象，社会主义阵营各国人民都联合在建设新社会的共同目的和马克思列宁主义的思想体系中，国际合作的基础是伟大的兄弟般互助原则。正因为如此，社会主义各国合作的发展和加强，同时也就是整个社会主义体系的发展和巩固。
    通过社会主义国家的经济合作，可以帮助不发达的兄弟国家在技术—经济方面很快地赶上发达的兄弟国家。当然，经济发展水平更高的国家也就更多地帮助其他兄弟国家。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在他的一次讲话中指出：“我们国家之所以帮助其他国家，因为我们是共产主义者，是马克思列宁主义者，我们不是闭门而居的。我们把社会主义和共产主义建设事业看作是伟大的国际主义事业。”
    最近七年内，苏联国民经济一切部门的进一步急剧发展，对加强和扩大苏联同所有社会主义国家经济联系具有最重大的意义。到1962年底，苏联将向社会主义国家提供四百六十二项工业企业和一百二十个单独车间的机器和装备，并且帮助这些企业和车间的建设和安装，使之投入生产。
    苏联人民为苏中经济联系顺利有效的发展而衷心地高兴。苏联正在帮助中国建设二百一十一项大型工业企业。不久以前又签订了一项苏联帮助中国建设和扩建许多企业的技术援助协定。在苏联向社会主义国家输出的机器和设备总额中，中华人民共和国几占一半。
    商品交流的高速度增加，特别证明了中苏两国经济关系的成果。1950年苏中之间的贸易总额是二十三亿零六百万卢布，而1957年则为五十一亿二千九百万卢布。中国从苏联进口的工业设备的份额在不断增长：1955年为30.7％，1956年为41.6％，1957年为50％。1958年苏中贸易总额又比1957年大大增长了。苏联向中国输出的商品是工业设备、各种机器和装置、黑色金属、石油产品以及化学品。苏联从中国得到的商品是有色金属和其他各种矿产品、轻工业产品、各种农产品和畜牧产品、水果、生丝以及许多其他商品。应当特别强调指出的是，由于中国工业发展的成就，中国向苏联输出的机器制造业产品，特别是造船业的产品正在增长。
    1958年4月，苏联和中国签订了通商航海条约。这项条约为进一步发展我们两国之间富有成效的经济和科学技术合作奠定了巩固的基础。
    现在，很难想像某一个人民民主国家会同其他社会主义国家没有经济联系。苏联的矿石和波兰的煤正在帮助欧洲人民民主国家发展黑色冶金业。捷克斯洛伐克同匈牙利的合作使捷克斯洛伐克得以建立本国的制铝工业。苏联以及捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和德意志民主共和国提供的机器，对中国工业化过程起着良好的作用。在中国方面，也向兄弟社会主义国家提供某些种类的设备、有色金属、轻工业和食品工业产品以及农业原料。匈牙利同罗马尼亚的经济联系为匈牙利展开了建立天然气加工工业的前景。所有这些例子（而这些例子是不胜枚举的）都说明，世界社会主义经济体系对每一个社会主义国家的发展，都起着越来越大的作用。
    生活表明，从前建立起来的社会主义国家间经济合作的形式和范围，已经不能完全适应目前世界社会主义经济体系具有的潜力了。特别应当指出的，有时发生了这种情况，如在各个国家中不必要地重复了同一类型的企业的建设，以及对社会主义世界市场中某些个别种类产品的需要估计不足。缺乏必要的专业化妨碍了许多国家在某些产品中进行大规模连续生产。这一切都首先对那些原料和人力资源有限的国家的经济发展不利。生活本身说明，过渡到经济合作的新形式，过渡到兄弟国家间更细致的劳动分工和更合理地安排生产的必要性。
    社会主义国家国际劳动分工发展的具体表现是，社会主义国家国民经济计划的协调一致以及这些国家最重要工农业部门生产的专业化和合作。
    各国国民经济计划的协调一致可以取得重大成果。它可以促进苏联和人民民主国家经济的更加迅速发展，并加速世界社会主义体系威力的增长。
    在工农业最重要部门发展方面，在水利资源综合利用方面以及解决最重要的科学技术问题方面的共同努力，能够在整个社会主义体系范围内更有效地利用原料资源和生产力，加快技术进步速度，减少生产费用和扩大最重要种类的工业产品的生产。例如，苏联同中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国共同努力建成了一条联结这三个国家的铁路干线。苏联和中国正在共同建筑兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路。我们两个兄弟国家正在共同努力准备解决像综合利用黑龙江水利这样重大的问题。
    苏联和人民民主国家已经开始了生产专业化和合作的实际工作，这项工作是在严格考虑到每一个国家的特殊利益和社会主义阵营各国的共同利益的基础上进行的。在苏联和欧洲人民民主国家参加的经济互助委员会的活动过程中以及通过双边谈判的方法，正在建立社会主义国家间有计划的劳动分工的基础。特别是在发展机器制造、黑色和有色冶金业、煤炭、石油和化学工业以及国民经济许多其他部门发展计划的协作，已经达成协议。
    显而易见，国民经济计划的协调一致，也将在越来越大的程度上决定经济合作的其他形式。社会主义国家对外贸易的计划性将要不断地改进。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在将向苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲里指出，1965年苏联同社会主义国家的对外贸易额将比1958年增长50％以上，并将大大扩大商品种类。在许多社会主义国家的对外贸易中它们输出的机器和设备的份额将要扩大。
  　苏联七年计划以及中华人民共和国和其他兄弟国家的经济发展远景计划表明，社会主义国家科学技术合作将提高到新的更高的水平。科学和技术方面的互相联系，特别是各国的科学—技术工作以及计划和设计机关的协作将增强。为了集体拟定科学研究工作计划和共同解决最重要的科学问题，社会主义各国科学院和科学研究所的共同努力将更加密切。苏联和中华人民共和国签订了关于科学技术合作的专门协定。1958—1962年将共同研究十二项最重要的科学技术问题，并将进一步加强两国科学研究机关的直接联系。社会主义国家将更快地走向世界科学和技术的顶峰。
    为了利用世界社会主义体系的一切优点，必须更充分和更准确地计算各兄弟国家互相间的需要和它们的供应潜力。例如，欧洲人民民主国家发展黑色冶金业的问题是这些国家社会主义工业化的根本问题之一。大家知道，几乎所有这些国家都没有铁矿矿藏或者只有贫铁矿。欧洲人民民主国家也还没有许多作合金用的矿石——铬、锰、镍、钼。在最近几年，苏联规定乌克兰和俄罗斯联邦共和国中部地区的铁矿开采的增长达到这样的程度：足以满足苏联南部和中部的冶金业的需要，并且向波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和其他欧洲人民民主国家供应铁矿。苏联的供应可以使波兰免于为开采劣质矿投入巨额的资金。同时，波兰的远景计划规定全力发展采煤，以便不仅供应国内需要，也来满足兄弟国家的需要。
    苏联同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国之间的经济合作在不断发展。苏联同这些国家之间的各种形式的经济联系在一年一年地发展着。在最近七年间，这种经济联系将继续发展。苏联将向这些国家提供数量越来越多的机器、设备、石油产品和其他商品。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国方面将向苏联输出矿产品、农产品、加工工业产品。
    分析一下兄弟国家的经济联系，就明显地看出世界社会主义体系国际专业化的特点：这种专业化是在每一个国家的经济多部门综合发展的基础上产生的。
    在最近七年间，当许多社会主义国家几百个新的工厂、冶金联合企业、矿场、发电站投入生产的时候，国际专业化同每一个国家内部经济综合发展的联系将更加显著。这些企业的产品生产将迅速增加，生产将主要具有大规模的特点。显然，正是在生产各种类型的产品的互相协作的条件下，才有这样卓越的效果，才使劳动生产率大大增长，节约原料并大大降低生产开支。
    毫无疑问，在社会主义国家经济合作方面，还面临这样一项巨大的工作：根据生产专业化和合作的方针，根据在兄弟国家互相联系范围内进一步加强计划化的方针来寻求更合理的联系。这是社会主义阵营各国的共同任务，以便更充分和更合理地利用国际劳动分工来为兄弟国家谋利，更充分有效地协调社会主义阵营每一个国家的利益和整个世界社会主义阵营的利益。
    兄弟国家合作的发展是苏联、中华人民共和国和共产党和工人党领导的社会主义阵营其他国家劳动人民自觉和有计划地活动的结果。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家国民经济发展的宏伟计划表明，城乡劳动人民越致力于自己国家经济的发展，就有利于相互间的经济联系，就越使世界社会主义体系的力量增长得快。
    现在，全世界都知道，在即将到来的七年间，世界社会主义体系的发展将比任何时候都更快，暂时还存在的个别社会主义国家经济发展不平衡的完全消灭的过程也将比任何时候为快，这些国家在进一步发展生产力方面的合作的意义将大大增加。
    拥有十亿居民的世界社会主义体系国家间的全面友好合作和互助，是列宁曾经说过的由所有国家工人阶级根据统一计划安排的未来的统一世界经济的范例。苏联共产党、中国共产党和社会主义国家其他共产党和工人党的政策，是社会的共产主义改造的重大因素，是进一步加强社会主义国家团结一致的必要条件。
