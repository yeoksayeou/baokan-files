Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A grand gathering was held in Berlin on the evening of December 30, 1958, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Communist Party. Representatives of the working people and people from all walks of life in the capital of the German Democratic Republic, veteran fighters of the German workers' movement, and thousands of others attended the meeting. Diplomatic envoys from many countries to the German Democratic Republic also attended this grand event.

    The presidium of the conference included: Hermann Remmele, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, among others.

    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a brief opening speech at the meeting. He said that the founding of the German Communist Party was a turning point in the history of the German workers' movement. The German Communist Party started as just a few groups, and now it is a large party. It is able to lead the German people towards socialism.

    Ulbricht emphasized that today, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, within the National Front, leads all parties in building socialism in the German Democratic Republic, resolutely fights against West German militarism, and strives to make all of Germany a peace-loving, democratic, and unified country again.

    Grobiher, an old Communist and a representative who participated in the founding congress of the German Communist Party in 1918, gave a report at the meeting. He described in detail the historical background of the founding of the German Communist Party and the struggle in various periods. He said that the founding of the German Communist Party was the result of a long-term struggle by the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party against the opportunism of the right wing of the Social Democratic Party, based on Lenin's anti-revisionist spirit. The founding of the German Communist Party in 1918 was the foundation for the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1946.

    Grobiher pointed out that at present, there are two forces in Germany engaged in struggle, namely, the struggle between German militarism and peaceful democratic forces. Although Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, also sang the praises of socialism in 1945, he has actually succumbed to Adenauer's policies and openly supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    When Grobiher mentioned the struggle waged by the German Communist Party in West Germany, he said that the German Communist Party will surely be able to complete the great task it faces of liberating the West German working class from social oppression.

    Grobiher said that, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, the characteristic of the current international situation is that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind." Winds are blowing against imperialism all over the world, and the economic development of the socialist camp surpasses that of the imperialist camp. The realization of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan will further prove the superiority of socialism and the great strength of Marxism-Leninism, as well as the bankruptcy of the absurd claims of modern revisionists that capitalism can peacefully grow into socialism. Modern revisionism opposes socialism and becomes an enemy of socialism. Socialism will surely triumph in all of Germany and throughout the world.

    Famous musicians, artists, and actors from the German Democratic Republic participated in tonight's grand event and performed masterpieces of German revolutionary art from the past forty years.

    柏林盛会庆祝德共成立四十周年
    乌布利希号召争取实现全德国的和平民主统一
    据新华社讯　1958年12月30日晚在柏林举行了盛大集会，庆祝德国共产党成立四十周年。参加会议的有民主德国首都劳动人民和社会人士的代表，德国工人运动的老战士等数千人。许多国家驻民主德国外交使节也参加了这个盛会。
    大会主席团人员包括：德国共产党中央第一书记雷曼、德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥等。
    德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希在会上致简短开幕词。他说，德国共产党的成立是德国工人运动历史的一个转折点。德国共产党在开始时只是一些小组，现在它已经是一个大党。它能够领导德国人民走向社会主义。
    乌布利希强调指出，今天，德国统一社会党在全国阵线中领导着各党派在民主德国建设社会主义，坚决对西德军国主义进行斗争，使全德国重新成为一个爱好和平、民主、统一的国家。
    老共产党员、参加1918年德国共产党成立大会的代表格罗比赫在会上作了报告，他详细地叙述了德共成立的历史背景和各个时期的斗争情况。他说，德国共产党的成立是德国社会民主党左派根据列宁反修正主义的精神对社会民主党右派的机会主义进行长期斗争的结果。1918年德共的成立是1916年德国统一社会党的成立的基础。
    格罗比赫指出，目前，在德国有两种力量在进行斗争，那就是德国军国主义与和平民主力量的斗争。西德的德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔虽然在1945年也高唱过社会主义，但实际上是屈服于阿登纳的政策，公开支持北大西洋集团。
    格罗比赫在提到德国共产党在西德所进行的斗争时说，德国共产党一定能够完成它所面临的使西德工人阶级从社会压迫下解放出来的伟大任务。
    格罗比赫说，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，目前国际形势的特点是“东风压倒西风”，全世界各地都向帝国主义刮风，社会主义阵营的经济发展胜过帝国主义阵营。苏联七年计划的实现将更进一步证明社会主义的优越性和马克思列宁主义的伟大力量，以及现代修正主义者叫嚣的资本主义和平长入社会主义的滥调的破产。现代修正主义反对社会主义，成为社会主义的敌人。社会主义必将在全德国和全世界获得胜利。
    民主德国著名音乐家、艺术家和演员参加了今晚的盛会，并且演出了四十年来的德国革命艺术杰作。
