    The First Plan: The Mass Line
    Shen Yonghua, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Doumen People's Commune, Shaoxing

    Newly planted spring flowers require timely nurturing and management to ensure a bountiful harvest. However, since the beginning of winter, prolonged drought and lack of rain have excessively dried the soil, severely impacting the growth of spring flowers. What measures should be taken to resolve this issue? At this point, we turned to the masses for guidance and consulted with the commune members. In the Second Team of the First Brigade, we convened a "Zhuge Liang" meeting, attended by veteran farmers, technicians, and cadres, to collectively study how to combat drought and protect seedlings. Through casual discussions, three effective measures were proposed: water wheel irrigation, application of liquid fertilizer, and irrigation with river mud. Because these measures originated from the masses and reflected their pressing needs, they were warmly welcomed upon being announced to all commune members, immediately triggering a high tide of fertilization, drought resistance, seedling protection, and spring flower cultivation throughout the commune.

    Countless facts tell us that the masses are "Zhuge Liang," and the working method of the mass line is the key to overcoming all difficulties. Only by relying on the leadership of the Party, conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line, treating the masses with an equal attitude, and consulting with them on all matters can any task be done with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Conversely, if we deviate from the Party's mass line, it will be impossible to do any work well. In our practical work, we have deeply realized that "of a thousand and ten thousand things, the Party's leadership comes first; of a thousand and ten thousand plans, the mass line is the first plan" is an irrefutable truth.

    群众路线第一计
    中共绍兴斗门人民公社委员会书记  沈永华
    春花刚种下，为了确保春花丰收，培育管理工作急需跟上。但是，由于入冬以来，天气久旱不雨，土地过分干燥，严重地影响了春花的生长。用什么办法解决这个问题呢？这时我们就去向群众请教，和社员商量。在一大队二小队召开了有老农民、技术员和干部参加的一次“诸葛亮”会，共同研究了如何抗旱保苗的问题。通过漫谈讨论，提出了车水、施水料、浇水河泥等三条行之有效的措施。由于这些措施来自群众，是群众的迫切要求，所以在向全体社员宣布后，就受到了热烈的欢迎，立即在全社范围内掀起了施肥、抗旱保苗、培育春花的高潮。
    无数事实告诉我们，群众是“诸葛亮”，群众路线的工作方法是克服一切困难的钥匙。任何工作只有依靠党的领导，认真贯彻执行党的群众路线，以平等的态度对待群众，遇事与群众商量，才能够做得多快好省。反之，如果离开了党的群众路线，就任何工作都不可能做好。我们在实际工作中深深体会到：“千条万条，党的领导第一条，千计万计，群众路线第一计”，是一条颠扑不破的真理。
