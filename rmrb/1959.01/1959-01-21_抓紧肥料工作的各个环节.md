Grasp Every Link in Fertilizer Work

In the struggle to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, the tasks of accumulating, producing, and transporting fertilizer have become unprecedentedly heavier. On the one hand, the widespread implementation of deep plowing and close planting, and the substantial increase in unit area yield targets, require more, better, and more diverse fertilizers; on the other hand, with the industrial, water conservancy, winter crop field management, sideline, and other aspects all requiring a lot of labor, the burden on the fertilizer accumulation teams is also heavier. Under these circumstances, how can fertilizer work be done more, faster, better, and more economically? The first thing is to arrange the various links of fertilizer work according to the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production. Specifically, it is necessary to comprehensively consider a series of links such as accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, preserving fertilizer, and applying fertilizer, according to this year's production increase plan requirements, to ensure that these tasks are all done well.

Fertilizer work was originally not a simple matter. However, in the past, people often regarded fertilizer work as very simple, as if fertilizer work was just accumulating fertilizer, and accumulating fertilizer was just piling up some farm manure. At that time, the requirement for fertilizer application per unit area was very low, little attention was paid to fertilizer quality, and the varieties of fertilizer were also very monotonous (almost all were organic fertilizers). At the same time, because very little fertilizer was to be accumulated, and there was winter slack at that time, labor was not a problem, so the transportation of fertilizer was not difficult. In short, the content and methods of fertilizer work understood by many people at that time could not meet the needs of today's high-speed development of agricultural production.

Now the situation is very different. We demand that agriculture not increase production slowly, but increase production at a high speed. We are not satisfied with small areas of high-yield fields of three or two mu, but we want to pursue large areas of high-yield fields of thousands or tens of thousands of mu. Under these circumstances, the planned fertilizer application has increased several times, and the requirements for fertilizer varieties and quality are also high. Therefore, fertilizer work must change the simplified approach of the past, and must comprehensively grasp all aspects of fertilizer, and make a great leap forward in fertilizer work. In terms of accumulating and producing fertilizer, the first thing to do is to attach equal importance to the quantity and quality of fertilizer, and to attach equal importance to organic and inorganic fertilizers. In addition, the accumulation and transportation of fertilizer must also be considered in combination. If fertilizer is accumulated but cannot be transported to the fields, the crops will still not be able to get fertilizer in time. Therefore, when accumulating fertilizer, it is necessary to consider the convenience of transportation, and arrange the labor and tools for transporting fertilizer. In the past, farmers were accustomed to piling all kinds of fertilizer in front of and behind their houses, which was not hygienic and inconvenient for transportation; now, it is necessary to vigorously promote the accumulation of fertilizer on the edge of the fields, as far as possible to accumulate fertilizer on the spot and apply it on the spot, at least to try to shorten the distance of transportation. In the past, accumulated fertilizer was piled up in the open air without protection, and the fertilizer effect was greatly lost due to wind, rain, and sun exposure; now, some places have added lids to manure cellars and sealed manure piles with mud, which is a good way to maintain fertilizer efficiency. The accumulation and production of fertilizer should also strive to meet the needs of various crops. Therefore, it should be possible to make farmers know what fertilizer is best for what soil and what crop needs what fertilizer at what time when accumulating and producing fertilizer. Some special circumstances also need attention, such as some closely planted fields, where it is difficult for people to enter the field to apply topdressing when the crops grow to a certain height. Last autumn, in order to apply topdressing to such closely planted fields, some places specially prepared a liquid fertilizer in advance, so that this fertilizer would flow into the fields along the small ditches. It can be seen that it is very necessary to take care of the specific needs of various crops for fertilizer in various situations as much as possible when accumulating and producing fertilizer.

Today's fertilizer work is much more complicated and detailed than in the past. Only by making thorough arrangements can the people's communes do this work well. In order to closely coordinate the various links of fertilizer work, the first thing is to allocate and organize the labor force well. Accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, and transporting fertilizer require a large amount of labor. The people's communes must take into account the various winter production and construction projects and allocate a considerable amount of labor to engage in fertilizer work. In terms of fertilizer production, it is also necessary to allocate and train a certain number of technical talents to engage in the production of local chemical fertilizers to ensure that the established local chemical fertilizer plants can produce normally. Second, in order to improve the efficiency of accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, and transporting fertilizer, efforts should be made to promote the improvement of tools in order to save labor. Fertilizer transportation is the most labor-intensive farm work, and it is necessary to strive to reform transportation tools, to fully motorize fertilizer transportation, and eliminate the phenomenon of carrying on shoulders and pushing by people. Third, a responsibility system must be established and improved in fertilizer work, so that each link has certain personnel specially responsible for it, which is convenient for management and inspection, and can also enable each link to supervise and promote each other. In order to closely combine the various links of fertilizer work and achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, the work that needs to be done is far more than these. Here, only the important ones are listed, the purpose is to arouse everyone's attention to this issue.

    抓紧肥料工作的各个环节
    在争取1959年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进的斗争中，积肥、造肥、运肥等项工作的任务空前加重了。一方面，深耕、密植的普遍推行，单位面积产量指标的大大提高，要求更多、更好、多种多样的肥料；另方面，在工业、水利、越冬作物田间管理、副业等各方面都需要许多劳动力的情况下，积肥队伍的担子也更加繁重了。在这种情况下，怎样使肥料工作多快好省呢？首先的一条是按照农业生产大跃进的新情况，来安排肥料工作的各个环节。具体说，就是要根据今年增产计划要求，把积肥、造肥、运肥、保肥、施肥等一系列的环节都加以通盘考虑，保证这些工作全面做好。
    肥料工作本来不是件简单的事。但是，过去人们往往把肥料工作看得很简单，似乎肥料工作就是积肥，而积肥就是堆积一点农家肥料。那时单位面积施肥量的要求很低，肥料质量也不大注意，肥料的品种也很单调（几乎全部是有机肥料）。同时，因为要积的肥料很少，而那时又有冬闲，劳动力不成问题，所以肥料的运输也就不困难。总之，那时许多人所理解的肥料工作的内容和所采取的方法，都不能满足今天农业生产高速度发展的需要。
    如今情况大不同了，我们要求农业不是缓慢地增产，而是高速度地增产，我们不满足于三亩两亩的小面积高额丰产田，而是要追求成千上万亩的大面积高额丰产田。在这种情况下，预定的施肥量增加了好几倍，肥料品种、质量的要求也高。因此，肥料工作必须改变过去那样的简单化的做法，必须全面地抓肥料的一切环节，在肥料工作上来个大跃进。在积肥、造肥方面，首先要做到肥料数量和质量并重，有机肥料和无机肥料并重。另外，积肥和运肥也必须结合考虑，积了肥料，运不到田里，庄稼还是不能及时得到肥料。所以，积肥的时候就要考虑运输的方便，安排运输肥料的劳动力和工具。过去农民习惯把什么肥料都堆在房前屋后，这既不卫生，又不便于运输；现在应当大力提倡田边积肥，尽可能就地积肥，就地施用，至少也要设法缩短运输的距离。过去，积好的肥料露天堆放，不加保护，任风吹雨淋日晒，肥效损失大半；现在，有些地方在粪窖上加盖，粪堆用泥封住，这是保持肥效的好办法。积肥、造肥还要力求符合各种庄稼的需要。因此应当尽可能使农民在积肥、造肥的时候，就知道什么土壤上什么肥料，什么庄稼在什么时候需要什么肥料最好。有些特殊情况也需要注意，如有些密植的田，庄稼长到一定的高度，人就很难进田追肥。去年秋季，有些地方为了给这样的密植田追肥，特地预先准备了一种液体肥料，使这种肥料顺着小沟流进田里去。可见，在积肥、造肥的时候，尽可能照顾到各种情况下各种庄稼对肥料的具体需要，是很必要的。
    今天的肥料工作比过去是复杂得多，细致得多了，人民公社只有进行周密的安排，才能把这项工作做好。为了使肥料工作的各个环节密切配合，首先要把劳动力调配好、组织好。积肥、造肥、运肥需要大量的劳动力，人民公社必须统筹兼顾冬季各项生产建设，拿出相当数量的劳动力来从事肥料工作。在造肥方面，还需要调配和训练一定数量的技术人材从事土化肥的生产，保证建立起来的土化肥厂能正常地生产。第二，为了提高积肥、造肥、运肥的效率，应当大力推广改良工具，以求节省劳动力。肥料运输是耗费劳动力最多的农活，一定要努力改革运输工具，把肥料运输全部车子化，消灭肩挑人推现象。第三，在肥料工作中必须建立、健全责任制，使各个环节都有一定的人员专负其责，便于管理和检查，也可以使各个环节互相督促推动。为了使肥料工作各个环节密切结合，达到多快好省的要求，需要做的工作决不止这一些，这里只举其要者，目的在于引起大家对此问题的重视。
