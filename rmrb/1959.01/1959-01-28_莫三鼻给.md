    Mozambique
    In Mozambique, under the barbaric rule of Portuguese colonialists, resistance actions have emerged. Recently, the people of Mozambique distributed leaflets criticizing Portugal's colonial policies and were suppressed.
    Mozambique is located in southeastern Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean and across the sea from Madagascar. It has an area of more than 770,000 square kilometers, more than seven times the size of Portugal. Of the approximately six million residents of Mozambique, 98% are Bantu Africans, with others including Indians, Arabs, and Europeans.
    Portuguese colonialists invaded East Africa as early as the 15th century, occupying the East African coast by 1510.
    For these 450 years, the people of Mozambique have lived a life of suffering under the enslavement of Portuguese colonialists. They have been deprived of all political rights. The colonial authorities' secret police run rampant everywhere, cruelly suppressing African resistance actions. In 1951, Portuguese colonialists even changed Mozambique into an "overseas province" of theirs, attempting to maintain their sinful colonial rule forever.
    The Portuguese colonialists treat Mozambique as a specialized production area for tropical crops, greedily plundering local products such as coconuts, sisal, rubber, cotton, and sugarcane. The Portuguese colonialists not only openly practice forced labor in Mozambique, but even sell the people of Mozambique as slaves to other countries. They once signed a treaty with the Union of South Africa to supply the Union of South Africa with 100,000 Mozambican laborers every year.
    Mozambique also suffers from the cruel plunder of foreign monopoly capital. The concessions owned by the British monopoly organizations "Nyasa Company" and "Zambesi Company" both exceed 100,000 square kilometers. After World War II, American imperialist forces began to infiltrate Mozambique. The United States has invested in the port and railway of Beira, and dozens of American companies are exploring minerals in Mozambique, plundering its raw materials. For example, the American corporation "Mozambique Gulf Oil Company" has obtained mining rights in an area of 120,000 square kilometers, which is larger than the area of Portugal itself (more than 91,000 square kilometers).

    莫三鼻给
    在葡萄牙殖民者野蛮统治下的莫三鼻给，出现了反抗行动。最近莫三鼻给人民散发传单，批评葡萄牙的殖民政策，遭到了镇压。
    莫三鼻给位于非洲东南部，滨临印度洋，和马达加斯加隔海相望。面积七十七万多平方公里，比葡萄牙大七倍多。在莫三鼻给的约六百万居民中，有98％是班图黑人，其他有印度人、阿拉伯人和欧洲人。
    葡萄牙殖民者早在十五世纪就侵入东非，到1510年占领东非沿岸。
    在这四百五十年中，莫三鼻给人在葡萄牙殖民者的奴役下过着痛苦的生活。他们被剥夺了一切政治权利。殖民当局的秘密警察到处横行，残酷地镇压着非洲人的反抗行动。1951年，葡萄牙殖民者更把莫三鼻给改为它的一个“海外省”，企图永远将罪恶的殖民统治保持下去。
    葡萄牙的殖民者把莫三鼻给当作它的一个热带农作物的专业化生产地区，贪婪地掠夺当地出产的椰子、西沙尔麻、橡胶、棉花和甘蔗等。葡萄牙殖民者不但在莫三鼻给公开实行强迫劳动，甚至还把莫三鼻给人民当奴隶向外出卖。他们曾和南非联邦签订条约，每年供给南非联邦十万名莫三鼻给的苦工。
    莫三鼻给还遭受着外国垄断资本的残酷掠夺。英国大垄断组织“尼亚萨公司”、“三比西公司”拥有的租让地，都超过十万平方公里。第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义势力开始渗入了莫三鼻给。美国对贝拉港口和铁路进行了投资，并且有几十个美国公司在莫三鼻给勘探矿藏，掠夺它的原料。例如，美国大公司“莫三鼻给海湾石油公司”就取得了十二万平方公里地区的开采权，这块土地比葡萄牙本国面积（九万一千多平方公里）还大得多。（亚）
