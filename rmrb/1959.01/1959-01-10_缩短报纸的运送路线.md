    Shorten Newspaper Delivery Routes
    Newspapers are very time-sensitive, and every reader hopes to see them as soon as possible. However, due to some unresolved issues in transportation, some areas that could receive newspapers early have to wait a day or two. For example, Jinan can see the newspapers published in Beijing on the same afternoon, but Pingyuan County, which is closer to Beijing on the same railway line, can only see them the next day. The main reason for this is that express trains only stop at major stations. Therefore, newspapers sent from Beijing to Pingyuan have to be carried by the fifth express train to Yucheng, and then transferred from Yucheng to a northbound slow train back to Pingyuan.
    To solve this unreasonable round-trip transportation, it is impossible to require express trains to stop at every small station. However, we wonder if it is possible to throw the newspapers from the mail car onto the station without stopping, or to slightly improve the mail car to "drop off" the newspapers at the station. In this way, not only can Pingyuan see the newspapers published in Beijing on the same day, but the newspapers sent from Pingyuan to neighboring counties will also be delivered earlier accordingly.
    This abnormal phenomenon exists on all railway lines across the country. Therefore, we suggest that the railway and postal departments jointly study this issue, and it would be best to try it out on one railway line first, and then promote it comprehensively after success.

### 缩短报纸的运送路线

    缩短报纸的运送路线
    报纸的时间性很强，每个读者都希望能尽快地看到。但由于运输上有些不合理的问题还没有解决，使有些可以早看到报纸的地区也不得不拖延一两天才能看到。如济南每天下午就可以看到当天北京出版的报纸，而在同一铁路线上的比济南距北京还近的平原县，却要在第二天才能看到。造成这种情况的主要原因是，快车只在大站停车。因此，由北京发往平原的报纸，只好由五次快车带到禹城，然后再由禹城转交北行慢车运回平原。
    为了解决这种不合理的往返运输，要求快车每个小站都停车，当然不可能。但是，我们想是不是可以在不停车的情况下，把报纸从邮车上投到站上，或是把邮车稍加改进一下，把报纸流放到车站上。这样，不但平原可以在当天看到北京出版的报纸，经由平原发往邻近各县的报纸也相应地提早了。
    这种不正常的现象，在全国各条铁路线上都存在。因此，我们建议铁路、邮政部门共同研究一下，最好能找一条铁路线先试一试，成功后再全面推广。
