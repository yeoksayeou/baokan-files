Xinhua News Agency, 25th. The Statement of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace on Supporting the Cuban People's Opposition to U.S. Interference. The full text is as follows:

    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace warmly congratulates the Cuban people on their great victory in overthrowing the U.S.-backed dictatorship and expresses sincere respect to the Cuban people who are fighting heroically against U.S. imperialist interference and for independence.

    The revolutionary victory of the Cuban people and their resolute struggle against U.S. interference have dealt a heavy blow to the forces of imperialist war and aggression and have made a significant contribution to the cause of national independence and world peace.

    The United States is blatantly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, obstructing the Cuban people from exercising their legitimate rights, which once again exposes the imperialist face of the United States. It is now increasingly evident that the United States is the root cause of creating tensions and a vicious enemy threatening the independence and security of Asian, African, Latin American, and all countries around the world. All peace-loving, kind, and upright people stand with the Cuban people against U.S. interference.

    The Chinese people express great indignation at the United States' blatant interference in Cuba's internal affairs and strongly condemn the U.S. aggressive behavior! We demand that the United States immediately cease any interference in the Cuban people!

    The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Cuban and Latin American people for national independence and the defense of peace. The Chinese people know from their own experience that in order to defend peace, it is necessary to resolutely smash imperialist interference and aggression.

    We firmly believe that in today's era of unprecedented growth of peace forces and national independence movements, and the increasing decay of imperialism, the just struggle of the Cuban people, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve even more brilliant victories.

    新华社25日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会关于支持古巴人民反对美国干涉的声明。全文如下：
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会热烈庆贺古巴人民推翻美国支持的独裁政权的伟大胜利，并向反对美帝国主义干涉和争取独立而英勇斗争的古巴人民，表示衷心的敬意。
    古巴人民的革命胜利和反对美国干涉的坚决斗争，给予帝国主义战争侵略势力以沉重的打击，对民族独立和世界和平的事业，作出了重大贡献。
    美国明目张胆地干涉古巴内政，阻挠古巴人民行使自己的正当权利，这再一次暴露了美国的帝国主义面目。现在愈来愈证明：美国是制造紧张局势的祸根，是威胁亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界各国的独立和安全的凶恶敌人。一切爱好和平和善良、正直的人们都和古巴人民站在一起，反对美国干涉。
    中国人民对美国横蛮干涉古巴内政表示极大愤慨，严正谴责美国的侵略行为！要求美国立即停止对古巴人民的任何干涉！
    中国人民一向同情和支持古巴和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立保卫和平的正义斗争。中国人民从切身经验中深知，要保卫和平，就必须坚决粉碎帝国主义的干涉和侵略。
    我们深信，在和平力量和民族独立运动空前壮大、帝国主义日益腐烂的今天，古巴人民的正义斗争，在全世界人民的支援下，定将获得更辉煌的胜利。
