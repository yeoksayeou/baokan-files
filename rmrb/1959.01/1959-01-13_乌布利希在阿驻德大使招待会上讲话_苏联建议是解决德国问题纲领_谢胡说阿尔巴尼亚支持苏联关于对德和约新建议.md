Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 12th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretery of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democractic Republic, said yesterday that the draft of the German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government is an important document that demonstrates the Soviet Union's full commitment to defending world peace and helping the German people solve national problems.

    He said that this draft is a realistic and constructive program for the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    Ulbricht made the remarks last night when he attended a banquet held by Gago Pazi, the Albanian Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, for the Albanian party and government delegation.

    Ulbricht pointed out that accepting the Soviet proposal to conclude a German peace treaty would not cause anyone to lose anything, but would allow everyone to win peace and a secure peaceful life. It is in line with the fundamental principles of the anti-Hitler alliance. It will help the German people ease tensions and bring the two Germanys closer.

    Ulbricht said that the attitude towards this draft treaty will be a touchstone, especially for West German residents who can see who supports a peaceful solution to the German question and who wants nuclear armament.

    Ulbricht said that the German Democratic Republic has been preparing for negotiations on such a treaty for many years. The German Democratic Republic does not possess nuclear weapons, does not implement conscription, and does not possess rocket bases. We are truly participating in negotiations on concluding a treaty as peace-loving people. Ulbricht said that anyone who truly wants German reunification must oppose the continued nuclear armament in West Germany. Because nuclear armament is the main obstacle to German reunification. He said that the Soviet draft of the German peace treaty can make it easier for those who have embarked on the road of nuclear armament to return to the path of peace. And that is the significance of this treaty proposal.

    Ulbricht said that the majority of the German people are in favor of a peaceful solution to the national question. On this road, the whole of Germany will not only become a peace-loving and democratic country, but also, due to its great economic potential and the great ability of scientists, technicians, the working class, and farmers, it will occupy a glorious position among the major countries and nations. In the student congress held in West Berlin, the representatives who supported the peaceful resolution of the German question, despite the oppression of the reactionary forces in West Germany, showed that the forces of peace-loving have begun to speak out bravely.

    Ulbricht said that in order to eliminate all hotbeds of war in Germany, it is necessary to eliminate the hotbeds of war in West Berlin, and it should be eliminated through the demilitarization and neutralization of West Berlin. The Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city is an important proposal for the peaceful solution of the German question.

    Ulbricht said that the discussion of the Soviet proposal will lead to the mutual rapprochement of the peace-loving people of the two Germanys. No anti-communist provocation can prevent West German workers and working people from recognizing that the German Democratic Republic is the foundation of a peaceful policy. Ulbricht expressed his conviction that the German Democratic Republic, in this struggle, will receive the fraternal support of the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries.

    Ulbricht also spoke about the achievements of the people of Albania and the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction and the consensus reached by both sides in this meeting. He said that this is because both countries and parties reject all revisionist trends, firmly stand on the position of Marxism-Leninism, and creatively apply it to the specific conditions of the two countries.

    Ulbricht said that in the struggle to defend peace, both countries stand in important positions. Neither the Balkans nor Central Europe should be allowed to become a battlefield for NATO strategists and a battlefield for atomic war.

    Ulbricht finally stated that Albania, in its resolute opposition to the establishment of American rocket bases in Italy and its struggle to maintain good neighborly and friendly relations with all Balkan peoples, will receive the full support and sympathy of the German Democratic Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 11th: The leaders of the Albanian Labor Party and the government have welcomed the Soviet proposal to convene a peace conference within two months to draft and sign a German peace treaty. This was said by Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, at a reception held by the Albanian Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, Pazi, tonight for the delegation's visit.

    Shehu said that the proposal made by the Soviet government is a major event in justly resolving the German question.

    Albania supports the new Soviet proposal without reservation.

    Shehu pointed out that no factor can prevent the reunification of Germany, and the reunification of Germany must be realized. The future, reunited Germany should be a democratic, peace-loving country, which will be an important factor for peace and friendship in Europe and the world.

    乌布利希在阿驻德大使招待会上讲话
    苏联建议是解决德国问题纲领
    谢胡说阿尔巴尼亚支持苏联关于对德和约新建议
    新华社柏林12日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希昨天说，苏联政府提出的对德和约草案是一个重要文件，它表明苏联全力保卫世界和平和帮助德国人民解决民族问题的愿望。
    他说，这个草案是和平解决德国问题的现实的和建设性的纲领。
    乌布利希昨晚出席了阿尔巴尼亚驻德意志民主共和国大使加戈·帕兹为阿党政代表团举行的宴会并在会上讲了话。
    乌布利希指出，接受苏联提出的缔结对德和约的建议，不会使任何人失去任何东西，而使所有的人赢得和平和有保障的和平生活。它符合反希特勒联盟的基本原则。它将帮助德国人民缓和紧张局势，使两个德国接近。
    乌布利希说，对这个和约草案的态度将是一个试金石，特别是西德居民可以看出谁是支持和平解决德国问题的，谁是要原子武装的。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国多少年来就为这样一个和约的谈判做了准备。德意志民主共和国没有拥有原子武器，没有实行义务兵役制，没有拥有火箭基地。我们是真正作为爱好和平的人去参加关于缔结和约的谈判的。乌布利希说，谁要是真正希望德国统一，就必须反对在西德继续进行原子武装。因为原子武装是德国统一的主要障碍。他说，苏联的对德和约草案可以使那些走上原子武装道路的人便于回到和平的道路上。而这就是这个和约建议的意义。
    乌布利希说，德国大多数人民赞成和平解决民族问题。在这条道路上，全德国不仅会成为爱好和平、民主的国家，而且由于其巨大的经济潜力以及科学家、技术人员、工人阶级和农民的巨大能力，它会在各大国、各大民族中占有一个光荣的位置。在西柏林举行的大学生大会中，赞成和平解决德国问题的代表不顾西德反动力量压迫的事实就表明爱好和平的力量已经开始勇敢地发言。
    乌布利希说，为了在德国消除所有的战争温床，就有必要消除西柏林的战争温床，而且要通过西柏林的非军事化和中立化来消除它。苏联关于把西柏林变为一个非军事化的自由城市的建议，是和平解决德国问题的重要建议。
    乌布利希说，对于苏联建议的讨论将会导致两个德国爱好和平人民的相互接近。任何反共挑拨都不能阻止西德工人和劳动人民认识德意志民主共和国是和平政策的基础。乌布利希表示他确信，德意志民主共和国在这一斗争中，将获得苏联和所有其他社会主义国家兄弟般的支持。
    乌布利希还谈到阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国两国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的成就和这次会谈中双方取得的一致意见。他说，这是由于两国和两党都排斥一切修正主义的潮流，坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的立场，并把它创造性地运用到两国的具体条件上。
    乌布利希说，在保卫和平的斗争中，两国都站在重要的岗位上。既不准许巴尔干，也不准许欧洲中部成为北大西洋公约组织战略家的比武场和原子战争的战场。
    乌布利希最后表示阿尔巴尼亚在坚决反对在意大利设置美国火箭基地和争取同所有巴尔干人民保持善邻和友好关系的斗争中，会得到德意志民主共和国完全的支持和同情。
    新华社柏林11日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的领导人表示欢迎苏联所提出的在两个月内召开和会起草和签订对德和约的建议。这是阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡在阿尔巴尼亚驻德意志民主共和国大使帕兹今晚为代表团的访问而举行的招待会上说的。
    谢胡说，苏联政府所提出的建议是公正地解决德国问题的一个重大事件。
    阿尔巴尼亚毫无保留地支持苏联的新建议。
    谢胡指出，没有任何因素能够阻止德国的重新统一，德国的重新统一必须实现。未来的、重新统一后的德国应该是一个民主的、爱好和平的国家，它将是欧洲和世界和平与友谊的一个重要因素。
