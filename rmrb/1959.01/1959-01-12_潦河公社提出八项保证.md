    Liaohe Commune Proposes Eight Guarantees

    (According to Henan Daily News) The Liaohe People's Commune in Nanyang, Henan, proposed eight guarantees to implement the ten initiatives put forward by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units.

    The eight guarantees are: 1. In agricultural production: Guarantee the realization of production targets for grain, cotton, and oil crops.

    2. In terms of commune-run industry, adhering to the spirit of "using local materials and processing locally," vigorously develop various industries such as machinery repair shops, comprehensive processing plants, fertilizer plants, pesticide manufacturing plants, and vermicelli factories on the basis of the existing 225 factories.

    3. Vigorously develop animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry. The total income should reach 6 million yuan. 4. Vigorously carry out wheat field management and deep ploughing of autumn fields. Ensure that topdressing is done three times during the entire wheat growing period, and five times for large-area high-yield fields. And do a good job in the inspection and prevention of diseases and insect pests.

    5. Conscientiously implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management. The commune implements a system of guaranteed output, guaranteed investment, and rewards and punishments for production brigades; the production brigade implements a "six-fixed" responsibility system for production teams, which means fixed personnel, fixed targets, fixed measures, fixed areas, fixed time, and fixed quality; the production team implements a labor quota system for commune members.

    6. In terms of commune members' lives, run collective welfare undertakings centered on canteens well. Enable every commune member to have reasonable arrangements for production, rest, and study time.

    7. Launch a full-scale advance towards science and culture.

    8. Continue to deeply study the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, arm our minds, and mobilize all forces to do a good job in commune management.
