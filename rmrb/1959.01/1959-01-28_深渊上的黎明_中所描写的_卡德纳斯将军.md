General Cárdenas, as depicted in "Dawn Over the Abyss," has deeply impressed me as an outstanding Mexican political activist after reading the novel.

General Cárdenas was just here with us, and he is our friend.

"Dawn Over the Abyss" is a historical novel by José Mancisidor, a well-known modern progressive writer in Mexico. It describes the struggle of the Mexican people against American and British imperialists to protect their country's oil resources. This historical event is inseparable from the name of General Cárdenas, who was then the President of Mexico. In 1936, Mexican oil workers launched a struggle against foreign oil companies to improve their economic conditions, and this struggle developed into a national anti-imperialist movement. In 1938, President Cárdenas, based on the will and wishes of the people, and in order to achieve national independence and defend national sovereignty, took decisive measures to nationalize the oil fields occupied by the United States and other imperialist countries.

This was a fierce struggle. The book describes the President, supported by the masses, expressing his determination to fight to the end:

"When it is absolutely necessary, if oil becomes an insurmountable obstacle to achieving national independence, we will have to take the final measure: to eliminate this obstacle! We will burn the oil fields!"

In a face-to-face negotiation with American and British capitalists, the book describes the President's concern for the fate of his country:

"The President clearly knew that the profits of foreign investors were soaring year by year; from the beginning of the twentieth century, millions of pounds and dollars had flowed from Mexico to New York, London, and Amsterdam. ... But he knew that justice was on his side, on the side of the people, on the side of the workers; ... But the President also knew ... why Mexican territory had been reduced by half, and he knew that the forces he was opposing today were once again dreaming of using the means of annexing weak countries to carry out territorial expansion.

"How great was his responsibility at this difficult and decisive moment!"

When American and British imperialism attempted to put pressure on the Mexican government, the book describes the President's fearless fighting spirit:

"'Mr. President, are you aware of the position of Mr. Roosevelt and the U.S. State Department?'

"In the President's calm and clear eyes, there was no trace of panic or embarrassment. He stared at the person he was talking to and said very firmly:

"'Our actions...will not be swayed by the actions of President Roosevelt or the U.S. State Department... Our future, the future of an independent nation, is in our own hands... I cannot make my government's activities adapt to the positions of two foreign powers. Our policy depends on the will of the freedom-loving and independent Mexican people, and the people demand respect for the rights they have gained through years of struggle.'"

With the support of the people, the struggle finally triumphed:

"The President did not lose his composure and calmness for a moment... an impeccable calmness, he spoke seriously, rarely gestured, his tone was even and full of passion,... 'For the public interest and the national interest... I announce nationalization'... He suddenly stood still, listening in surprise to the hustle and bustle coming from the square. The sound grew louder and louder, like the waves crashing on the shore. The people... wanted to tell the President that he was not alone... The President shielded his eyes from the sun and walked to the window facing the square... The square below was surging with people. Many clenched fists were raised angrily..."

In the writings of the famous Mexican writer Mancisidor, this president is such a figure full of anti-imperialist patriotism and love for the people; after reading this novel, one cannot help but feel more cordial and respectful towards this general in real life. (Text)

### “深渊上的黎明”中所描写的  卡德纳斯将军

    “深渊上的黎明”中所描写的
    卡德纳斯将军
    我读完了“深渊上的黎明”，就深深地印上了卡德纳斯将军这位墨西哥杰出政治活动家的形象。
    卡德纳斯将军刚在我们这里，和我们在一起，是我们的朋友。
    “深渊上的黎明“是墨西哥现代著名进步作家何塞·曼西西杜尔写的历史小说，它描述了墨西哥人民为了保护自己祖国的石油资源而反对美、英帝国主义者的斗争。这个历史事件，是和卡德纳斯将军的名字分不开的。当时卡德纳斯将军是墨西哥的总统。1936年，墨西哥石油工人为了改善经济条件，和外国石油公司展开斗争，这个斗争发展成了全民族的反帝国主义运动。卡德纳斯总统根据人民的意志和愿望，为了实现民族独立，保卫祖国主权，采取断然措施，于1938年宣布把美国和其它帝国主义占有的油田收归国有。
    这是一场激烈的斗争。书中这样描写了总统在人民群众支持下，表示了坚决斗争到底的决心：
    “在万不得已的时候，如果石油成为实现民族独立的不可逾越的障碍的话，我们就只有采取最后的手段：将这个障碍消灭掉！我们把石油产地加以焚毁！”
    在和美英资本家面对面的一场谈判中，书中这样描写了总统对祖国命运的关心：
    “总统清楚地知道，外国投资者们的利润正在逐年飞涨；从二十世纪初期起，千百万英镑和美元从墨西哥到了纽约、伦敦和阿姆斯特丹。……但是他知道正义是在他这方面，在人民方面，在工人方面；……但是总统也知道……墨西哥的领土为什么减少了一半，他知道今天他所反对的势力又重新梦想着使用并吞弱小国家的手段进行领土扩张。
    “在这艰难而又决定性的时刻，他的责任是多么重大！”
    美英帝国主义企图对墨西哥政府施加压力，书中这样描写了总统的大无畏的斗争精神：
    “‘总统先生，您知道罗斯福先生和美国国务院的立场吗？’
    “在总统镇静而清彻的眼睛里，没有闪过惊慌或是困窘的影子。他盯着谈话的对方，很坚决地说：
    “‘我们的行动，……决不以罗斯福总统的行动或是美国国务院为转移……我们的未来，一个独立民族的未来，掌握在我们的手里……我不能够使我的政府的活动适应两个外国强国的立场。我们的政策取决于爱好自由的和独立的墨西哥人民的意志，而人民要求对多年斗争所获得的权利表示尊重。”
    在人民的支持之下，斗争终于胜利了：
    “总统一时一刻也没有失掉自己的严肃和沉着……无可非难的沉着，他说话时很严肃，很少打手势，声调平稳而充满热情，……‘为了公共的利益和全国的利益……宣布国有化’……他突然站在原地不动了，很惊疑地倾听着从广场上传来的熙熙攘攘的声音。声音越来越大，好像拍岸的海浪一样。人民……想要向总统说他并不是孤立的……总统用手遮住眼睛避着阳光，向面对广场的窗户走去。……下面的广场上汹涌着人群。许多攥紧的拳头愤怒地向上举起……”
    在墨西哥名作家曼西西杜尔的笔下，这位总统就是这样一位充满着反抗帝国主义的爱国精神和热爱人民群众的人物；读了这本小说之后，使人不禁会对这位现实生活中的将军更感到亲切和敬重。（文）
