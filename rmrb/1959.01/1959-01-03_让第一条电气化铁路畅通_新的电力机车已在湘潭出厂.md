Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 1st: The Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant has successfully trial-produced China's first 138-ton single-phase industrial frequency 50-cycle 25-kilovolt AC main line electric locomotive.

On December 28, 1958, the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant held a celebration meeting for the completion of this electric locomotive and transported the locomotive to Beijing that evening as a gift to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

This 138-ton AC main line electric locomotive is designed and manufactured for the Baoji-Fengzhou section of China's first electrified railway—the Baocheng Railway. The body of this electric locomotive resembles a giant streamlined bus, 21 meters long, 3.2 meters wide, and 4,780 millimeters high. Its total weight is 138 tons, and it can pull a train weighing more than 5,000 tons on a flat track, with an hourly speed of 90 *hua li* and a maximum speed of 220 *hua li*. It was designed by referring to Soviet drawings and modifying and supplementing them according to the specific conditions of China's railways. From components, parts, and motor elements to precision instruments, everything is made in China. It also adopts the most advanced single-phase industrial frequency AC ignitron rectifier device in the world. Compared with many other types of electric locomotives, this electric locomotive has the advantages of saving electricity and high power. Compared with steam locomotives, it has greater and more sustained power, and can still maintain a speed of more than 90 *hua li* when traveling on a 30‰ gradient. Therefore, it is suitable for driving in places with large slopes, many tunnels, and large transportation volumes. It can also save a lot of coal, improve workers' working and safety conditions, and is easy to manage, clean, and hygienic. At the same time, electric locomotives do not need water and can also run in the water-scarce Gobi Desert. The steel used to manufacture an electric locomotive is also more than two-thirds less than that used to manufacture a steam locomotive.

This electric locomotive is the product of nationwide communist collaboration under the leadership of the Party. More than 80 people from more than ten units including railway systems and universities across the country participated in the design of this locomotive. In the process of manufacturing this locomotive, the Soviet Union gave China selfless assistance, not only providing China with the latest locomotive drawings, but also sending experts to help solve various technical problems.

    让第一条电气化铁路畅通
    新的电力机车已在湘潭出厂
    据新华社长沙1日电　湘潭电机厂试制成功了我国第一台一百三十八吨单相工频五十周波二十五千伏交流干线电力机车。
    1958年12月28日，湘潭电机厂为这台电力机车的制成举行了庆祝大会，并在当晚将机车运往北京，向党中央和毛主席献礼。
    这台一百三十八吨交流干线电力机车是为我国第一条电气化铁路——宝成路宝鸡、凤州段设计制造的。这台电力机车的车身像一辆巨型的流线型公共汽车，车长二十一公尺，宽三点二公尺，高四千七百八十公厘。它的车身总重是一百三十八吨，在平道上能拖动载重五千吨以上的列车，小时速度为九十华里，最高能达到二百二十华里。它是仿照苏联图纸，并根据我国铁路的具体情况修改补充以后设计的，从部件、零件和电机元件到精密仪表全部是我国自己制造的。它并且采用了目前世界上最先进的单相工频交流引燃管整流的装置。这台电力机车与许多其他类型的电力机车比较，具有节省电力、功率高等优点。与蒸汽机车比较，它的力气大而持久，在千分之三十的坡道上行驶仍能保持九十华里以上的时速。因此适合在坡度大、隧道多和运输量大的地方行驶；它还能节约大量的煤，能改善工人的劳动条件和安全条件，管理方便，清洁卫生。同时，电力机车不要用水，在缺水的戈壁沙漠也可以行驶。制造一台电力机车用的钢材还比制造一台蒸汽机车要少三分之二以上。
    这台电力机车，是在党的领导下实行全国范围共产主义大协作的产物。全国各铁道系统、高等学校等十多个单位的八十多人，参加了这台机车的设计。在制造这台机车过程中，苏联给了我国无私的援助，不仅供给了我国最新的机车图纸，而且派来专家帮助解决各种技术问题。（附图片）
