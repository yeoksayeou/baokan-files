Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 7th. The affected residents of Dadeng Island and their families, who suffered from the shelling by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island, have received care and proper resettlement from the government and the stationed troops.

On the 3rd, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island shelled the residents of Shantou Village, the People's Liberation Army troops on the island, while fighting the enemy, risked their lives together with the members of the People's Commune to rescue the victims. Those who were seriously injured were quickly sent to hospitals on the mainland for treatment. Some residents whose houses were collapsed by the shelling were also resettled and lived in houses vacated by other commune members.

In recent days, the command of the Fujian Front troops and the party and government departments of Nan'an County have sent representatives to express their condolences to the affected residents. The party and government organs and troops in the front-line areas have also allocated a sum of cash, grain, and vegetables to the families of the deceased to solve their difficulties in life. The families of the deceased have repeatedly expressed to those who came to express their condolences that they have food and clothing in the commune, and that the Party, the government, and the army should not worry about them. They will definitely work harder in the future to support the People's Liberation Army in combat and avenge their loved ones.

    大嶝岛军民沉痛追悼受难同胞
    受难居民及其家属已妥善安置
    新华社福建前线7日电　遭受金门岛蒋军轰击的大嶝岛受难居民及其家属，受到政府和驻地部队的关怀和妥善安置。
    3日，金门岛蒋军炮击山头村居民的时候，岛上的解放军部队，一面同敌人作战，一面和人民公社的社员一起冒着生命危险，抢救遇难社员，伤势重的被迅速送到大陆上的医院进行治疗。一些被打塌房子的居民，也得到了安置，住到其他社员让出来的房子里。
    最近几天，福建前线部队指挥机关和南安县党、政部门，都派代表来慰问受难居民。前线地区的党政机关、部队，还拨出一笔现金、粮食和菜蔬等分别送给死难者家属，解决他们生活上的困难。死难者家属一再对前来慰问的人表示，他们在公社里，有吃有穿，党和政府、军队不要为他们耽心。他们今后一定更加努力支援解放军作战，替亲人报仇。
