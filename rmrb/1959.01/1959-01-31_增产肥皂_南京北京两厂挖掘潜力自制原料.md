    Increase Soap Production
    Nanjing and Beijing Factories Tap Potential, Self-Produce Raw Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - Soap production has increased at the Nanjing Municipal Joint State-Private Nanjing Soap Factory. The soap produced in the first and middle ten-day periods of January has already exceeded the total output for the entire month of December last year.
    From the beginning of this year, the Nanjing Soap Factory has mobilized its workers to vigorously develop the production of raw materials and the use of substitutes, creating conditions for increasing soap production. Worker Chen Guiqing and others used indigenous methods to produce caustic soda solution, a soap raw material, and have gradually achieved self-sufficiency in caustic soda solution, which was previously processed by fraternal factories. The workers also bleached and utilized rice bran oil foots, increasing the source of soap raw materials. Currently, the factory is actively preparing to build a hardened oil workshop and expand the caustic soda workshop to further develop the production of raw materials and strive for greater leaps in soap production this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - After tapping production potential, the Beijing Daily Chemical Factory will increase its soap production from January to April by 80% compared to the original plan.
    The factory's soap workshop went into production in December last year and has now reached its designed output level. The workers recently studied and discussed the matter and decided to continue to tap production potential and achieve a great leap forward in soap production without adding new equipment or labor. They decided to repair and assemble two sets of old and broken cooling slabs into a complete set, and to self-manufacture a cutting machine out of wood to solve the equipment problem; they decided to dig six indigenous wells and use indigenous methods to produce caustic soda and sodium silicate to solve the problems of water and raw materials; due to the lack of labor, the entire factory made unified arrangements to transfer thirty-five workers from other workshops to support the soap workshop. Currently, the workers transferred from various workshops have successively arrived at the soap workshop, and the six indigenous wells will be completed within days. The indigenous method of producing caustic soda has reached a level of two tons per day. As a result of solving these problems, the soap workshop will soon change from two shifts to three shifts.
    At present, all the workers in the factory are stepping up preparations for expanding production.

    增产肥皂
    南京北京两厂挖掘潜力自制原料
    新华社南京30日电　南京市公私合营南京肥皂厂肥皂增产，1月上、中两旬生产的肥皂，已经超过了去年12月份全月的产量。
    南京肥皂厂从今年一开始就发动职工群众大搞原材料生产和利用代用品，为肥皂增产创造条件。工人陈贵清等用土法制出了肥皂原料烧碱水，原来依靠兄弟厂加工的烧碱水已逐步做到自给。职工们还把米糠油脚漂白后加以利用，增加了肥皂原料的来源。目前，这个厂正在积极筹建硬化油车间，扩建泡化碱车间，进一步大搞原材料生产，争取今年的肥皂生产有更大的跃进。
    新华社30日讯　北京日用化学厂经过挖掘生产潜力，1月到4月份的肥皂产量将比原计划提高80％。
    这个厂的肥皂车间在去年12月份投入生产，现在产量已经达到了设计的水平。职工们最近经过研究和讨论，决定继续挖掘生产潜力，在不增添新设备和劳动力的情况下实现肥皂生产的大跃进。他们决定把已经多年不用的两套破旧冷板，修理拼凑成一套完整的冷板，用木料自制开块机，解决设备问题；决定打六眼土井，并用土法制造烧碱和泡化碱，解决水源和原材料问题；缺少劳动力，全厂便统一安排，从其他车间抽调三十五个工人来支援。现在，从各车间抽调的工人已陆续来到肥皂车间，六眼土井日内即将打成，用土法生产烧碱已达到日产两吨的水平。由于这些问题的解决，肥皂车间即将由原来的两班生产改为三班生产。
    目前，全厂职工正在加紧进行扩大生产前的准备工作。
