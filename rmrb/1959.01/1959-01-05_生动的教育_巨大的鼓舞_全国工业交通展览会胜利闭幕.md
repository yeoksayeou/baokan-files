Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, organized by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and fifteen central industrial and transportation ministries upon the suggestion of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, concluded successfully at 5:00 PM today after being on display for three months and twenty days.

Since its opening on September 15th of last year, the exhibition has received 3,150,000 visitors, an unprecedented scale. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country organized visiting groups to come and learn. Hundreds of thousands of visitors enthusiastically left messages and inscriptions, praising the great victories and brilliant achievements of socialist construction in our motherland during the Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the First Five-Year Plan under the wise leadership of the Party. They expressed that they had received an extremely vivid and graphic socialist education and technical education at the exhibition, and that upon returning to their posts, they would continue to exert their utmost efforts and leap forward again and again.

The exhibition also received over 7,000 foreign guests from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, as well as other countries, totaling more than sixty nations.

The National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition took place during a period when the Chinese people were working hard and advancing vigorously towards the realization of the 1958 plan. The rapidly changing new production records, new achievements, and newly trial-produced products from various industrial and transportation fronts across the country were continuously sent to the exhibition hall, adding new splendor to the exhibition. The newly added products made for the first time in our country alone numbered over 660, with an average of six new products joining the exhibition each day.

This exhibition, the largest in China's history, not only inspired millions of visitors to bravely advance in the cause of socialist construction but also played a certain role in promoting the current vigorous industrial production and transportation undertakings in our country. During the exhibition, nearly 150 report meetings, symposiums, and on-site performance observation meetings were held to promote and exchange various advanced experiences; over 1,700 kinds of technical materials, totaling approximately 3 million copies, were distributed, and more than 300 scientific and technical films were screened. These technical exchange activities helped many units obtain advanced experience and technical data.

    生动的教育  巨大的鼓舞
    全国工业交通展览会胜利闭幕
    据新华社4日讯　根据中共中央建议，由国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会和中央十五个工业交通部共同筹办的全国工业交通展览会，经过三个月零二十天的展出，在今天下午五时闭幕。
    展览会自从去年9月15日开幕以来，接待了三百一十五万名观众，盛况空前。全国各省、市、自治区都组织了参观团，前来参观学习。成千上万的观众热情洋溢地留言、题词，盛赞在党的英明领导下，祖国在1958年大跃进和第一个五年计划期间社会主义建设的伟大胜利和光辉成就。他们表示，在展览会上受到了一次极其生动的、形象的社会主义教育和技术教育，回到自己的工作岗位后，要继续鼓足干劲，跃进再跃进。
    展览会还接待了来自苏联和各兄弟国家以及其他国家共六十多国的外宾七千多人参观。
    全国工业交通展览会在展出期间，正是我国人民为实现1958年的计划艰苦奋斗、高歌猛进的日子。各个工业交通战线上日新月异的生产新纪录、新成就和试制成功的新产品，不断地从祖国各地送进展览馆，给展览会增添了新的光彩。仅是新增加的我国第一次制成的新产品，就有六百六十多件，每天平均又有六件新的产品参加展出。
    这个为我国历史上规模最大的展览会，不仅鼓舞着千万名观众为建设社会主义事业奋勇前进，对我国当前轰轰烈烈的工业生产和交通事业，也起到了一定的推动作用。在展出期间，展览会举办了近一百五十次报告会、座谈会和现场表演观摩会，推广和交流各种先进经验；发行了一千七百多种、约三百万册各种技术资料，放映了三百多场科学技术电影。这些技术交流活动，帮助许多单位取得了先进经验和先进技术资料。
