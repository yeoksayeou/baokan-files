According to the Ningxia Daily, the large-scale copper smelting movement in Guyuan Prefecture, which began in early September of last year, has achieved significant results, with the entire prefecture smelting a total of sixty-four tons of copper matte.

Through vigorously launching mass movements, a total of 186 copper mine locations were found in the entire prefecture, 125 of which have been mined, yielding a total of more than 4,000 tons of copper ore. In terms of furnace construction and smelting, 404 various native blast furnaces such as the Xiji-style and Jiangning-style have been built, along with more than 1,400 various native square furnaces and natural draft furnaces. In smelting, various localities have created many high-yield records. The Haiyuan Rocket No. 11 native blast furnace smelted continuously for fourteen days and sixteen hours under normal operation, producing more than 2,800 jin of copper, setting the highest record in the entire prefecture.

In the copper smelting movement, Guyuan Prefecture adopted the method of using local materials and relying on its own efforts to solve a series of difficulties. The masses used refractory sandstone to replace refractory bricks, and cylinder slag to replace refractory mud. When there were no scales, they used axes instead, and when there were no houses, they dug cave dwellings in the mountains to live in. This not only accelerated the progress of production, but also saved a large amount of funds.

Mastering smelting technology was the biggest difficulty. In order to solve this problem, Luo Wenwei, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Guyuan Prefectural Committee, personally took charge, personally built a furnace, and established a copper smelting plant for the prefectural organs in Guyuan City. He first gained experience in breaking through the technical barrier, and trained a group of technical personnel who were dispatched to various counties to help build furnaces and smelt. The first secretaries of various counties went deep into the construction sites and furnace sides, adopting the method of combining leadership, the masses, and technology, and finally comprehensively broke through the technical difficulties of smelting, enabling various furnaces to operate normally in production.

At present, various counties are determining mine locations, carrying out "five fixings" work, and building large-scale Jiangning-style copper smelting furnaces, in order to strive for a greater harvest of copper production this year, and to continue to work hard, practically, and cleverly to complete the production task of thirty tons of copper in the first quarter.

    固原提高炼铜“小土群”
    第一季度将产三十吨冰铜
    据宁夏日报消息　固原专区在去年9月上旬开始的声势浩大的炼铜运动，取得了显著的战果，全专区共炼冰铜六十四吨。
    通过大搞群众运动，全专区共找到铜矿点一百八十六处，已开采一百二十五处，共采出铜矿石四千余吨，在建炉、冶炼方面，已经建起西吉式、江宁式等各种土高炉四百零四座，各种土方炉和自然风炉一千四百多个。在冶炼中各地创造了很多高产纪录。海原火箭十一号土高炉正常冶炼十四昼夜零十六小时，出铜二千八百多斤，创造了全专区最高纪录。
    固原专区在炼铜运动中，采取就地取材，自力更生的办法，解决了一系列的困难。群众用耐火砂岩代替耐火砖，用缸渣代替耐火泥，没有磅锤就用斧头代替，没有房屋就在山上挖窑洞居住。这样，不仅加快了生产的进度，同时还节约了大批资金。
  掌握冶炼技术是最大的困难。为了解决这个问题，中共固原地委副书记罗文蔚曾亲自挂帅，亲自建炉，在固原城建立了专区机关炼铜厂，首先取得突破技术关的经验，并培养出一批技术人材，分赴各县帮助建炉和冶炼。各县第一书记深入工地炉旁，采取了领导、群众、技术三结合的方法，终于全面地突破了冶炼技术难关，使各种炉子都能正常地进行生产。
  目前，各县正在确定矿点，进行“五定”工作，并兴建大型江宁式炼铜炉，为争取今年铜产更大的丰收，为完成第一季度三十吨铜的生产任务而继续大干、实干、巧干。
