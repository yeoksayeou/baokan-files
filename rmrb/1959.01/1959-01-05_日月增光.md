The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket, following its predetermined path, has reached the lunar region and is now heading towards the sun. The red flag embroidered with the hammer and sickle, along with the words "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics," will now also flutter around the sun.

This truly adds radiance to the sun and moon. From now on, the sun will no longer be an ordinary sun, nor the moon an ordinary moon, but the sun and moon draped in the communist red flag, radiating communist brilliance. The higher and wider this red flag flies, the greater the brilliance of communism, the deeper the influence of communism will penetrate people's hearts, the closer people's hearts will be to socialism and communism, and the faster the darkness cast upon people by capitalism will be eliminated.

In ancient times, when the people were so cruelly oppressed by the rulers that they saw no hope for the future, they sighed, "When will the sun perish?" and cursed the sun to fall early. There were also great poets who used the moon to express their inner sorrow: "I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown." Now, whenever people look up at the sun and moon, they will think of that bright red flag, they will think of socialism and communism. For the people still under the rule of capitalism and colonialism, it will now be "I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of liberation."

In our world, there are some people who cannot bear to see this flag. They get a headache at the sight of it, and shout about the "communist threat." And they rush to dispatch some shady characters to tear it down, just like the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government instructed thugs to tear up the flag of the People's Republic of China. They spare no effort to block the influence of socialism and communism on the hearts of the people under their rule. They launch every propaganda tool they can to conduct propaganda that distorts the truth, portraying socialism and communism as terrifying.

However, the sun and moon cannot be blocked. In the United States, some people have long wanted to monopolize the moon. Long before the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite went into space, Americans were clamoring to go to the moon, and some were even selling moon stocks and auctioning off land on the moon in the United States. However, they still cannot get there. Moreover, we no longer hear this disgusting clamor.

In fact, they know very well that there are no people on the moon for them to enslave, and the land on the moon cannot yet be cultivated. The reason they clamored so loudly was simply to exaggerate, to make the people of the world believe that capitalist America was far superior to socialist Soviet Union. However, this myth of the superiority of the capitalist system, fabricated through deliberate mystification, has completely gone bankrupt. Now, the red flags of socialism and communism are flying on the sun and moon. This flag declares to the people: Communism is not only the most superior social system in the existing human social system, but also the most developed social productive forces and the most abundant social products, as well as the most advanced culture, science and technology level. Therefore, people's hearts will inevitably turn to it, and therefore it will inevitably defeat all kinds of old social systems. No matter how famous the anti-communist heroes in this world are, they cannot stop the world from moving towards this bright future. This will naturally make the Dulleses and all the anti-communist heroes on earth feel disheartened, but there is nothing they can do about it. They have no way to prevent people from seeing the sun and moon, and they have no way to prevent people's hearts from tending more towards socialism and communism. Kyodo News Agency of Japan issued a dispatch from Tokyo on the 3rd, in which there was a very interesting sentence, saying: "Even if this red flag is erected on the moon, because it is a place that cannot be touched, no one can tear it down."

They cannot block it, and they cannot tear it down, which is really going to scare that small group of people to death. Their fear of the growing influence of communism in people's hearts far exceeds their fear of missiles. As for us, the people of the whole world, as long as the sun continues to shine, we will sing loudly: Why is the sun so red? Because it is draped in the communist red flag! Why is the sun so bright? Because it has added the light of communism!

    日月增光
    葛德
    苏联宇宙火箭，按照预定的路线，到过了月球区域，如今奔向太阳去了。那面绣着镰刀锤子的红旗，连同“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟”的大字，如今也要绕着太阳飘扬了。
    这真是使日月增光。从此，太阳再不是普通的太阳，月亮也不再是普通的月亮，而是披上共产主义红旗，放射着共产主义光辉的太阳和月亮了。这红旗飘扬得越高，越广，共产主义的光辉越大，共产主义的影响越要深入人心，人心便离社会主义和共产主义越近，资本主义投给人们的黑暗也便要越快地消除了。
    古代的人民，被统治者残酷压迫得看不到出头之日的时候，曾经浩叹过“时日曷丧”，诅咒太阳也早早殒落。也曾有过大诗人借着月亮抒发内心的忧伤：“举头望明月，低头思故乡”。现在每当人们抬头看到太阳和月亮的时候，便会联想到那面鲜红的旗子，便会联想到社会主义和共产主义。对尚在资本主义和殖民制度统治下的人民来说，现在将会是“举头望明月，低头思解放”了。
    在我们这个世界上，有些人是见不得这种旗的，一见便头疼，惊呼什么“共产主义威胁”。而且要赶紧像日本岸信介政府纵使歹徒撕毁中华人民共和国国旗一样的，派遣一些见不得人的东西去拔掉它。他们费尽心机来封锁社会主义和共产主义对于他们治下的人心的影响，他们发动一切可以发动的宣传工具，进行颠倒黑白的宣传，把社会主义和共产主义说得如何如何可怕。
    但是，太阳和月亮是封锁不住的。在美国倒是早就有人想独占月球。远在苏联第一颗人造卫星上天以前，就有美国人大嚷大叫的要到月球上去，而且还有人在美国发售月球股票，拍卖月球上的地皮。然而，他们至今也还上不去。而且，也不再听到这种令人恶心的嚷嚷了。
    其实，他们何尝不知道，月亮上并没有地球上这样供他们役使的人，月亮上的土地，也还不能耕种。他们所以要那样大嚷小叫，无非是借题发挥，使世界上的人听起来，好像资本主义的美国要比社会主义苏联优越的多。但是，这种故弄玄虚，制造出来的资本主义制度优越的神话，彻底破产了。如今太阳和月亮上飘扬的是社会主义和共产主义的红旗。这面旗子向人们宣示：共产主义，不仅是现有人类社会制度中最优越的社会制度，而且是最发达的社会生产力和最丰富的社会产品，而且是最先进的文化、科学和技术水平，因此人心必然要归向它，因此它必然要战胜各种旧的社会制度。不管这个世界上有多么名声煊赫的反共英雄，也阻挡不了世界走向这个美好的前途。这自然会使杜勒斯之流以及地球上一切反共的好汉们气短，但它们却也没有法子。他们没有办法使人们不看到太阳和月亮，他们便没有办法使人心不更加趋向社会主义和共产主义。日本的共同社3日在东京发了一个电讯，其中有一句很有意思的话，说是：“即使这面红旗竖立在月球世界上，因为那是一个手摸不到的地方，所以，谁也不能把它扯下来。”
    挡又挡不住，扯又扯不下，这就真真的要使那一小撮人怕死。他们害怕共产主义影响在人心中增长，是远远超过害怕导弹的。至于我们，全世界的人民，只要太阳照旧发光，便要放声歌唱：太阳为什么这样鲜红？因为披上了共产主义的红旗！太阳为什么格外发亮，因为增添了共产主义的光芒！
