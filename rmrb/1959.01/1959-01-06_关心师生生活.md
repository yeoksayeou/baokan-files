Caring for people and the lives of the masses is something our Party has always valued. In schools, while focusing on arranging study and labor time recently, Party organizations in many schools have also paid attention to and resolved some of the living problems of teachers and students. The Fudan University Party Committee’s measures to improve the lives of teachers and students and ensure their studies and work are very good.

For more than half a year, encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, teachers and students in various schools, especially young students, have thrown themselves into the reform of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research with soaring energy and enthusiasm in implementing the Party's education policy. However, because the new educational order of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research has just been established, they are not yet good at arranging their new study lives well. Therefore, in their selfless labor and soaring enthusiasm, they have squeezed out some rest time. This high revolutionary enthusiasm and drive of teachers and students is, of course, extremely valuable. As leaders, on the one hand, we must encourage the enthusiasm of teachers and students, and on the other hand, we must care about the rest and sleep of teachers and students to ensure their health. In particular, the difficulties and problems that young students encounter in their study life and ideology after participating in labor should be resolved in a timely manner. Mobilizing the masses to complete teaching, production, and scientific research tasks and caring for their lives are both indispensable. It is necessary to enable the broad masses of teachers and students to correctly understand the dialectical relationship between labor and rest, hard work and recuperation, and to properly arrange the time for study, work, labor, and rest, so as to study well, work well, labor well, and rest well.

At present, in addition to making comprehensive and specific arrangements for teaching, labor, and rest time, many school Party committees have also begun to pay attention to and improve students' dormitory environment, sanitation, medical care, and food. Some school Party secretaries regularly go to the kitchen and dormitories to understand the students' food and accommodation, discover problems in a timely manner, and solve them promptly. Shanghai Fudan University has conducted special research on the life and rest problems of teachers and students, and has also designated a deputy Party secretary to specifically lead this work. This has greatly encouraged teachers and students and further promoted their enthusiasm for study and work. Everyone is full of energy and high spirits. In order to make greater leaps in school education, we must pay more attention to the teaching and living of teachers and students in vigorously implementing the Party's education policy and working hard, and regard it as an important political task.

    关心师生生活
    柏生
    关心人，关心群众生活，这是我们党在任何时候都重视的事情。在学校里，最近在抓学习、劳动时间安排的同时，许多学校的党组织也都注意关心和解决师生中的一些生活问题。复旦大学党委注意搞好师生生活，保证学习和工作的措施就很好。
    半年多来，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，各校师生，尤其是青年学生们在贯彻党的教育方针中，都以冲天的干劲和热情，投入到教学改革、生产劳动和科学研究工作中去。但是，由于新的教学、生产劳动和科学研究三结合的教育秩序刚刚建立起来，他们还不善于很好地安排新的学习生活，因此，在忘我劳动和冲天的干劲中，就挤掉了一些休息时间。师生的这种高涨的革命热情和干劲，当然是极为可贵的。作为领导者，一方面要鼓舞师生的干劲，一方面又要关心师生休息、睡眠，以保证师生的健康。特别是青年学生们，在参加劳动后，学习生活和思想上发生的一些困难和问题，要及时帮他们解决。动员群众完成教学、生产、科学研究任务，和关心他们的生活，都是不可忽视的。必须使广大师生正确理解劳动和休息、苦战和休整之间的辩证关系，把学习、工作、劳动和休息的时间安排妥当，做到学习好、工作好、劳动好、休息好。
    目前，许多学校党委领导上，除了对教学、劳动和休息的时间做了全面具体的安排外，还开始注意对学生的宿舍环境卫生、医疗、伙食等方面进行了研究和改善。有的学校党委书记定期下厨房下宿舍了解学生吃住情况，及时发现问题，及时就解决。上海复旦大学对师生员工的生活和休息问题专门进行了研究，同时指定一位党委副书记具体领导这方面的工作。这样作，给师生很大的鼓舞，更加促进了他们学习和工作的干劲，人人精神饱满，意气风发。为了使学校教育工作有更大的跃进，在大力贯彻党的教育方针和苦战苦干中，必须更加关心师生的教学生活，并把它当作一项重要的政治任务来进行。
