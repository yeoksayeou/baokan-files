    After listening to the "Youth Piano Concerto" on the radio, I found it very beautiful. The announcer specifically told us that this was a newly composed piece by young pianist Liu Shikun and three others. Its characteristic is that it broke with old ideas and used a national orchestra to accompany the piano. Before this, many people thought that the piano could only be accompanied by a Western orchestra.
    As an ordinary listener, I don't have so many prejudices and old conventions. When we listened to the "Youth Piano Concerto," we only felt that this piece of music was rich in national flavor, the melody was beautiful, the piano sound was powerful, and the accompanying music was also very bright and lovely. We only felt that it was fresher and easier to accept than the piano music we were used to hearing, and we didn't feel that these were two opposites playing together at all!
    The spirit of these young pianists in exploring how to strengthen the national characteristics of music and daring to think and act is commendable. It is conceivable that they do this with the idea of serving the masses, and the purpose of their efforts is precisely to enable the wider masses to understand, become familiar with, and love the piano.
    This is also the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy in musical creation, a result of combining indigenous and foreign methods, opening up a new road.

    在广播中听了一次“青年钢琴协奏曲”，觉得它很动听。广播员特意告诉我们，这是青年钢琴家刘诗昆等四人新创作的曲子，它的特点是打破了旧的观念，让民族管弦乐队来为钢琴伴奏了。而在这以前，很多人认为钢琴只能用西洋管弦乐伴奏。
    作为一个普通的听众来说，我对这些是没有那么多成见和陈规戒律的。当我们听“青年钢琴协奏曲”时，我们只觉得这支乐曲富有民族风味，旋律很美，琴音铿锵有力，伴奏的音乐也十分明朗可爱。只觉得它比以往听惯了的钢琴曲还新鲜，还容易接受，丝毫也没有感到这是过去认为的两个对立物拼在一起演奏的！
    青年钢琴家们这种探索音乐如何加强民族色彩和敢想敢干的精神是值得赞扬的。可以想像，他们这样做是有为群众服务的观点的，他们努力的目的也正是为了让更广大的群众都能理解钢琴、熟悉钢琴和喜爱钢琴。
    这也是在音乐创作上贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，是土洋结合的成果，打开了一条新道路。
