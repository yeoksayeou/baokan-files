Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the afternoon session on January 29th and the morning session on January 30th of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delegations from fraternal parties of Bulgaria, North Korea, Vietnam, Albania, Mongolia, and Indonesia delivered congratulatory messages.

    Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian people to the Congress, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people.

    He said that the important report made by Comrade Khrushchev at the Congress was full of Lenin's spirit of creativity, characterized by its magnificent momentum, profound theory, and far-reaching practical significance. This report is of extremely important theoretical and practical significance for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, for socialist countries, and for all fraternal socialist and workers' parties.

    Zhivkov said that the Bulgarian people consider the 21st Congress of the CPSU to be the most cordial and precious event for them. Your Seven-Year Plan is our joy, our pride, and our inspiration.

    Zhivkov said that without the socialist camp or detached from the socialist camp, without the assistance of the Soviet Union and the unparalleled wealth of experience of world historical significance of the Soviet Union, it is not only unimaginable to complete our Bulgaria’s great tasks, but also to carry out any construction of a socialist society. I would like to assure you once again that the Bulgarian Communist Party has been, is, and will always be a loyal and reliable contingent of the international communist movement. It will defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and will conduct an irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology, modern revisionism, and all phenomena that deviate from Marxism-Leninism.

    Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, congratulated the Congress, saying that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union creatively develops Marxism-Leninism and constantly leads the Soviet people to new victories, and it is the vanguard of the international workers' movement.

    He mentioned that the historically significant 20th Congress of the CPSU not only accelerated the communist construction of the Soviet Union, but also made a significant contribution to the development of the international communist movement and the strengthening of the world's peace forces. Kim Il-sung said that hundreds of millions of people around the world who demand peace and yearn for socialism are watching the great Soviet Union with hope, and are inspired by the ever-increasing power of the Soviet Union.

    Kim Il-sung continued, saying that since the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in November 1957, the forces of peace and socialism have grown stronger. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is more closely united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and the unity of the international workers' movement has been further consolidated.

    Kim Il-sung emphasized that we believe that the Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party, will victoriously complete the Seven-Year Plan, thereby accelerating the communist construction of the Soviet Union and making new and great contributions to the happiness of all mankind. The realization of the Soviet Union's grand plan for building communism will further inspire the Korean people to strive for the construction of socialism and for the peaceful reunification of their country.

    Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, congratulated on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the working people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marks a new stage in the vigorous development of socialist society. The control figures for developing the national economy to be adopted at this Congress are to solve a historical task—to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries.

    Ho Chi Minh emphasized that the Soviet people have already achieved historically significant achievements in science, culture, technology, art, and improving the welfare of all the people. The Soviet people's achievements in launching earth satellites and cosmic rockets have opened up a new era for mankind to conquer the universe.

    Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the completion of the Seven-Year Plan will make the Soviet Union the most powerful country in the world and will further strengthen the power of the socialist camp. This is also a reliable guarantee for maintaining lasting world peace.

    Ho Chi Minh said that the achievements of the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union inspire the Vietnamese people in the struggle to build socialism in their own country and increase their strength in the struggle to reunify North and South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people will also make their due contribution to the cause of defending peace in Southeast Asia and peace throughout the world. Ho Chi Minh also read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party to the Congress.

    Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, said in his congratulatory message at the afternoon session that this Congress of the CPSU is an event of world historical significance. Hoxha said that this Congress has filled the hearts of all ordinary people on all continents with hope and strengthened the confidence that communism will surely win.

    Hoxha spoke about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in economic and cultural development, and about the achievements of Soviet science and technology. He said that the spark of the Great October Revolution ignited by the genius of Lenin flew into the boundless space and turned into a solar planet. Hoxha continued, saying that the dark forces have suffered a devastating blow, and nothing can stop the construction of communism. The achievements of the Soviet people have shocked the world and demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism.

    Hoxha said that the Albanian people are sincerely happy for the achievements of their friends, saviors, and liberators—the Soviet Union.

    Speaking about the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, Hoxha said that the implementation of this plan will further strengthen the forces of peace and will give a devastating blow to revisionism and reformism.

    At the morning session on the 30th, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said that the delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party considers it a great honor to participate in this historically significant Congress of communist builders. Not only are the Soviet people watching this Congress with joy, but the working people of all countries around the world are sharing this joy. As a result of the tremendous work, the Soviet Union is ready to make new leaps forward on the road to building communism. Tsedenbal emphasized that Khrushchev's report is a major contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. The control figures discussed at the Congress are an embodiment of Marxist-Leninist doctrine and a demonstration of the undeniable superiority of socialism over capitalism.

    Dipa Nusantara Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, congratulated the 21st Congress of the CPSU on behalf of the Communist Party of Indonesia and the working people. He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved great successes in the development of industry, agriculture, culture, and science, in improving the welfare and living standards of the working people, and on the international stage. These achievements have enhanced the prestige of the Soviet Union and the prestige of the working class in various countries around the world.

    Aidit told the delegates to the Congress: You have set a task: to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output. Based on the experience the Soviet people have gained in completing the tasks of developing and consolidating the Soviet state and economic tasks in the past, it can be said that you will surely achieve great victories. Your loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, the support of the entire Soviet people for the Seven-Year Plan, and the support of the working people of the world for you are the guarantee of your victory.

    Aidit said that in seven years, especially after fifteen years, there will be great fundamental changes in the world.

    Aidit emphasized that the democratic and patriotic forces of Indonesia are increasingly united, and they are increasingly clearly putting forward the goal of freeing their country from the economic influence of imperialism.
