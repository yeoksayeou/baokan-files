Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 13th: The Lifu Lane Private Nursery School in Nanjing's Qinhuai District insists on implementing health care systems and pays attention to cultivating children's hygiene habits. In the two years since its establishment, there have been no cases of epidemic infectious diseases, and all the children are healthy and developing well.

The staff of this nursery school strictly implement health care systems, acting as both teachers and nurses. For several years, they have insisted on conducting entry check-ups and regular follow-up examinations for children. Children attending for the day are observed carefully in the morning for signs of fever, paying close attention to their eyes, ears, nose, throat, and cheeks. If a child has a fever, they are immediately isolated and sent to the hospital for treatment. During the infectious disease season, they teach and care for the children even more carefully, giving them salt water to drink, having them wear masks, paying attention to their clothing for warmth and coolness, and taking various preventive measures.

In daily life, they attach great importance to cultivating children's hygiene habits. They use storytelling, singing, puppet shows, and other games to educate children about hygiene knowledge, such as washing hands before meals and after using the toilet, spitting into spittoons, and not defecating or urinating indiscriminately. Over time, the children have developed these habits. Now, as soon as they hear the meal bell, the children habitually gather at the tap to wash their hands. If someone doesn't wash their hands clean, everyone points at their little hands and asks them to wash them again. The children's eating utensils and implements are also disinfected daily. They maintain close contact with the parents, frequently informing them of their children's lives at the nursery and learning about the children's lives from the parents.

In terms of diet, the nursery school follows the guidance of the district health station, arranging menus weekly and changing the variety every day. During cooking, they pay attention to both maintaining nutrients and ensuring the food is fine, chopped, well-cooked, and fragrant. They make various palatable vegetable congees with bean sprouts, radishes, red beans, and green vegetables. These foods are inexpensive and nutritious. Xu Yan, who is three years old, used to often have diarrhea and was weak at home. After entering the nursery, he not only stopped having diarrhea but also grew rosy and plump. His parents happily said: "Feeling the flesh all over my child's body, I am truly grateful to the caregivers from the bottom of my heart."

    南京李府巷民办托儿所注意培养孩子卫生习惯
    新华社南京13日电　南京市秦淮区李府巷民办托儿所，坚持执行保健制度，注意培养孩子们的卫生习惯，成立两年多来没有发生过流行性传染病，孩子们个个身体健康，发育良好。
    这个托儿所的工作人员严格执行保健制度，既做老师、又当护士，几年来坚持着幼儿入托检查和定期复查的制度。日托的孩子早晨到所时，都要详细观察眼、耳鼻、喉、腮等处，检查有无发烧征兆。如果发烧，马上隔离和转送医院治疗。在传染病流行季节，她们更加细心教养，给孩子们喝盐开水，带口罩，注意衣着的热和冷，并且采取各种预防措施。
    在日常生活中，她们十分重视培养孩子们的卫生习惯。她们利用讲故事、唱歌、玩木偶戏和其他游戏等，教育孩子们在饭前便后要洗手，吐痰入盂，不随地大小便等卫生常识。这样，天长日久，孩子们就养成习惯了。现在孩子们一听到开饭铃声，就习惯地集合在水龙头下面洗手。谁洗得不干净，大家都指着他的小手，要他重新洗过。儿童的食具、用具也每天进行消毒。她们和家长们保持着密切的联系，经常向家长反映孩子的生活情况，也从家长处了解孩子的生活情况。
    在饮食方面，托儿所遵照区保健站的指导，每周排定菜单，天天调换花样。烹调时，既注意保持营养素，又注意到细、碎、烂、香。她们把豆芽、萝卜、红豆、青菜等做出各种可口的菜粥，这些食品，价格便宜，营养丰富。三岁的许琰，在家时常泻肚子，身体瘦弱。入托后，不但不泻肚子，并且长得又红又胖，他的父母高兴地说：摸到孩子浑身肉，真是从心眼里感激阿姨们。
