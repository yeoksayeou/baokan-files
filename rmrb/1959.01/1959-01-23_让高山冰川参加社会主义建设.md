    Let Alpine Glaciers Participate in Socialist Construction

    Without "Alpine Reservoirs," Where Would Oases Come From?

    China's vast arid regions in the northwest, including the Hexi Corridor, Qaidam, Tarim, and Junggar basins, are important areas for economic construction. Although the majority is boundless desert, these areas have relatively stable water supplies, and oases like pearls dot the barren landscape. Why is this so? It turns out that several towering mountain ranges, such as the Qilian, Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains, stand above the snow line. Thousands of perennial glaciers, like endless silver waves, cover the mountain tops. Meltwater from the glaciers flows down to the plains, forming several sparse rivers. These thousands of glaciers are like thousands of alpine reservoirs. They accumulate snow and ice year-round, and during the peak growing season in summer, they melt the ice and snow to irrigate farmland and supply water for people's use.

    Worldwide Glacier Area Accounts for One-Tenth of Land

    Glaciers are a special type of natural cover on the Earth's surface. In permanently cold regions above the snow line in high mountains and near the North and South Poles, fresh snow accumulates and recrystallizes, with the grains becoming coarser to form firn. Later, it turns into ice. When the ice reaches a certain thickness, due to gravity and the pressure of the upper layers of ice, and because of the plasticity of ice, it slowly flows, becoming a glacier. Each glacier has its own accumulation zone (called the firn field) and ablation zone (mostly tongue-shaped, called the ice tongue). The transition zone from the firn field to the ice tongue roughly indicates the location of the snow line. The global glacier area is about 15 million square kilometers, accounting for one-tenth of the total land area. Glaciers are divided into two major categories: continental glaciers and mountain glaciers. In Antarctica, Greenland, and islands and continents near the Arctic, the ground is entirely covered by ice, forming continental glaciers. Their area accounts for more than 95% of the total glacier area. These regions are perpetually frigid, and the development of industry and agriculture is greatly limited. Although the volume of ice is enormous, the economic significance is small. Mountain glaciers are distributed in the mountains of Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Australia, located in the upper parts of valleys, and are relatively fragmented, with a total area of less than 100,000 square kilometers. Some mountain glaciers are in humid areas, such as the glaciers in the Himalayas of Asia and the Alps of Europe. The plains at the foot of the mountains have abundant water flow, making it unnecessary to further develop and utilize the glaciers. There, glaciers are only objects for exploration and tourism. Only the glaciers in the mountains of the arid regions of Central Asia, which are the direct source of irrigation water for the foothills and intermountain plains, have significant economic significance. The reason why Soviet scholars conducted in-depth research and investigations on glaciers in the western Tianshan and Pamir regions and established several famous glacier observation stations is because these glaciers have economic value. However, the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union is not as dry as northwestern China, and the existing ground water sources are basically sufficient. Therefore, although Soviet scholars have conducted experiments on melting ice and snow on alpine glaciers, they have not applied and promoted it as an important means of expanding water sources. Taking alpine glaciers as an important economic resource and as an object of development and utilization should be pioneered by China.

    China Has a Huge Number of Glaciers, Scientific Research is Still a Blank

    China's mountain glaciers are distributed in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountains (Himalayas, Karakoram, Kunlun Mountains) and the Qilian, Tianshan, and Altai Mountains in the northwest. Due to the vast area of high mountains in China and the large number of mountain glaciers, it may rank first in the world. Although the glacier area and water storage capacity of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang have not been thoroughly investigated, according to Soviet scholars' data, the glacier area in the Tengger Mountain glacier region (the largest glacier center in the Tianshan Mountains) on the Sino-Soviet border alone reaches 2,500 square kilometers. The largest valley glacier is 53 kilometers long and 400 meters thick. The Kunlun Mountains, stretching along the southern edges of the Tarim and Qaidam Basins, also likely have a large number of glaciers due to their long mountain range. The Karakoram Mountains on the border between Xinjiang and Kashmir are not only the most developed high mountains in Asia but also in the world, with the mountain ridges entirely covered by ice and snow, and only individual peaks protruding from the ice surface. In total, the area of modern glaciers in the high mountains of the above-mentioned arid regions exceeds 10,000 square kilometers, and the total storage capacity may reach 1 trillion to 2 trillion cubic meters (the water storage capacity of the 1,592 reservoir projects completed in China since the winter before last is more than 25.9 billion cubic meters. The amount of water flowing into the sea from the Yangtze River each year is 1 trillion cubic meters). The development of glaciology in the world has a history of more than 100 years, and glaciers have special economic significance in China. However, in the scientific field in China, research on modern glaciers has always been a blank spot. The only small amount of records about glaciers mostly come from the pens of foreign explorers. We ourselves have no data on the quantity of glacier resources, material balance, and the life history of glaciers.

    Preliminary Survey of Qilian Mountains Glacier Storage Capacity Reaches 40 Billion Cubic Meters

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 and the proposal of large-scale desertification control and Gobi transformation tasks made it an urgent problem to solve the issue of whether to expand water sources in arid areas of the northwest, including expanding and advancing glacier ablation. In mid-June, personnel from more than 20 units, including the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geophysics, Lanzhou University, Northwest University, Nanjing University, and the Water Conservancy Departments and Meteorological Bureaus of Gansu and Qinghai Provinces, formed a high-altitude ice and snow utilization research team and launched a determined attack on modern glaciers in the Qilian Mountains. More than 100 young people who had never been in contact with modern glaciers, lacked mountaineering training and corresponding equipment, with the help of Soviet expert L.T. Dolgushin, and with the collaboration and support of relevant departments, overcame all difficulties. In a short period of three months, they traversed the major mountain ranges of the Qilian Mountains and basically determined the distribution, types, and storage capacity of modern glaciers in the Qilian Mountains. They observed the characteristics of glacier accumulation and ablation, the relationship between glaciers and river recharge, and, through experiments and understanding of mass experience, explored the possibility of artificially promoting ice and snow ablation and expanding water sources. Two high-altitude stations were also established on the high mountains at an altitude of about 4,000 meters.

    The Qilian Mountains consist of several parallel high mountains and valleys oriented in a northwest-west direction. The mountain system is 800 kilometers long and 200 to 400 kilometers wide, and the highest peak is 6,300 meters above sea level. The annual precipitation in the eastern section of the high mountains is about 700 millimeters, while the western section is only 300 to 400 millimeters. The snow line gradually rises from about 4,200 meters on the northern slope of the eastern section to about 5,200 meters in the west. Above the snow line, the annual snowfall is greater than the ablation. Fresh snow cover first turns into granular firn, and the firn freezes and becomes compacted into dense ice layers. When the ice layers accumulate to a critical thickness on the mountain slope, they move downward in a tongue-like shape below the snow line, thus forming a glacier. The glaciers in the Qilian Mountains can be divided into: 1. Valley glaciers (long ice tongues extending into valleys), 2. Cirque-valley glaciers (transitional type), 3. Cirque glaciers (limited to the concave cirques on mountain slopes, with reduced ice tongues), 4. Cirque-hanging glaciers (transitional type), 5. Hanging glaciers (obliquely attached to steep mountain slopes), 6. Flat-top glaciers (developed on flat-topped mountains) and other major types. The total number of glaciers is more than 1,000, the total glacier area is about 1,300 square kilometers, the ice layer thickness ranges from a few meters to more than 100 meters, the ice density is 0.8 to 0.9, and the total storage capacity is about 40 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 600 Ming Tombs Reservoirs, truly a huge water conservancy resource.

    Glaciers are completely frozen in winter. In summer, not only does the ice tongue part below the snow line have vigorous ablation, but even in the firn field above the snow line, there is also a certain degree of ablation at noon on sunny days. Summer is also the season with the most frequent snowfall in the high mountains throughout the year. The process of snowing and melting simultaneously has become an important feature of the glaciers in the Qilian Mountains. According to the statistical data obtained from 15 key glacier survey points in July, August, and September last year, the natural meltwater volume of glaciers averaged 1 cubic meter per second per 10 square kilometers of glacier area. The total natural meltwater volume of glaciers in the entire Qilian Mountain area is estimated to be about 1 billion cubic meters.

    Adopting the Method of Blackening Glaciers Can Increase Glacier Meltwater Volume

    The heat for melting ice and snow mainly comes from solar radiation and heat exchange between the air and the ice and snow surface. Different weather conditions, terrain conditions, the degree of pollution of the ice and snow surface, and the structure of the ice and snow all affect the melting rate. If humans can change some of these conditions, they can regulate the degree of ice and snow ablation. The first thing that humans thought of was to sprinkle black substances on the ice and snow surface to reduce the reflection of solar radiation and promote ablation.

    Due to their own urgent needs, the masses in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, began the work of artificially blackening glaciers in the Qilian Mountains to increase meltwater volume as early as the late Qing Dynasty. Since liberation, whenever there is a water shortage in April and May, more than 100 people are organized to venture to the glacier area 200 kilometers away to melt ice and snow. They collect cow, horse, and sheep manure and weeds and fallen leaves on the spot, burn them into ash, and sprinkle it on the ice and snow surface. Last year, 160 people were mobilized to blacken a glacier area of about 8 square kilometers. The results of the small-area ice and snow surface spraying experiments with carbon black and coal ash conducted by the sixth detachment of the High-Altitude Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team show that each square kilometer of glacier surface after blackening has a daily and nightly meltwater volume of about 10,000 cubic meters more than that of a non-blackened surface. Artificial blackening can have the effect of promoting ablation within the limit of a temperature of minus 5 degrees Celsius or an ice surface temperature of minus 8 degrees Celsius. From this, it can be seen that it is entirely possible to artificially regulate ice and snow ablation, allowing glaciers to flow downstream half a month earlier to solve the problem of insufficient farmland water use in May and June. The High-Altitude Ice and Snow Utilization Research Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the unified leadership of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, is prepared to combine with the mass water conservancy work in the Hexi region and carry out ice and snow melting experiments in more than 10 areas in the Qilian Mountains this year, striving to expand the meltwater volume by 100 million to 200 million cubic meters for irrigating 300,000 to 600,000 mu of land. If this work is successful and gradually promoted to the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains and other regions, it is hoped that sufficient glacier meltwater (about 4 billion cubic meters) will be increased to irrigate 10 million mu of land within three to five years.

    Of course, there are still many difficulties in making the high mountain glaciers, which have been out of reach for mankind for thousands of years, serve socialist construction obediently. Taking the method of artificial blackening to promote ice and snow ablation as an example, blackening one square kilometer of glacier requires dozens of tons of materials. Due to the inconvenient transportation of high mountain glaciers and the obstacles of the high-altitude and cold natural conditions, it is very troublesome to transport these materials to the ice surface and spread them evenly, whether by human power or by aircraft. Second, snowfall on the ice surface from time to time in summer buries the blackened materials, increasing the complexity of the work. Third, the riverbeds under the glaciers have considerable seepage problems, and seepage prevention projects must be carried out simultaneously with ice and snow melting. We have not yet deeply revealed the ice and snow ablation process under various conditions, and therefore have not been able to open up new ways to melt ice and snow other than artificial blackening. It is necessary to combine professional scientific research with mass ice and snow melting work, use both indigenous and foreign methods, and create economical and effective ice and snow melting methods that are mastered by the masses and easy to promote on a large scale.

    Worrying About the Decline of Glaciers is an Unnecessary Worry

    Some worriers, based on the fact that glaciers in various parts of the world have generally been in a state of recession since the Quaternary Ice Age, are worried about the fate of the decline of glaciers, believing that it is not appropriate to expand ice and snow ablation, but advocate protecting glaciers. Our view is different. Modern glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are indeed smaller than they were during the Quaternary glacial period. The ends of modern glaciers are generally above 4,000 meters, while the remains of ancient glacier ends can be found at a height of about 3,000 meters. However, whether the glaciers are currently advancing or retreating still needs to be studied in detail. We have discovered that there are fresh, advancing layers of active ice superimposed on aging layers of dead ice on several glaciers. Even if most glaciers are retreating, their rate is very slow. The scale of current ice and snow melting work is still very small. As far as the huge glacier storage capacity is concerned, it is not that ice and snow melting work has threatened the existence of glaciers, but that there is still a lack of a cheap and effective method to allow glaciers to expand ablation and serve socialist construction. If there is really such a day, when the scale of ice and snow melting has expanded and the accumulation of glaciers is affected, then humans can also promote glacier ablation on the one hand by using artificial blackening or other methods, and increase glacier accumulation on the other hand by using artificial snowfall or other methods. We believe that after a considerable period of effort, humans can control the occurrence and development of glaciers to a certain extent and become the masters of glaciers.

    Studying and Utilizing Alpine Glaciers Promotes the Development of New Disciplines

    The progress of high-altitude ice and snow utilization work not only has significant economic significance, but will also drive the development of a series of disciplines, and even the birth of new disciplines. The first is a new type of glaciology aimed at controlling the occurrence and development of glaciers. This includes glacier hydrology, glacier meteorology, glacier geomorphology and geology, ice and snow crystallization and structural research, and so on. The second is high-altitude science, which is generated in connection with glacier exploration and research. It studies the laws of natural resources and climate, landforms, vegetation, rock weathering, permafrost, debris flow and other processes under special conditions in high mountains. Third, starting from glacier water sources, and linking artificial rainfall, regulation of surface runoff, and search and exploration for groundwater, a unified arid zone water source science will be established centered on the theory of water cycle, balance, and regulation. From this, it can be seen that as long as scientific workers serve the national economy with all their strength, and adopt the method of driving disciplines with tasks, high-altitude ice and snow research alone can open up broad prospects for related sciences, especially for geography.

    1959 is a year of continued great leap forward in high-altitude ice and snow utilization research. In addition to carrying out large-scale ice and snow melting experiments in the Qilian Mountains, we will also investigate ice and snow resources in the Tianshan Mountains and other mountainous areas. This year, we must achieve greater results in both economic effects and academic research.

    让高山冰川参加社会主义建设
    中国科学院地理研究所副研究员　施雅风
    没有“高山水库”沙漠何来绿洲
    我国西北部广大干旱区，包括河西走廊、柴达木、塔里木、准噶尔等重要经济建设区域在内，虽然绝大部分是茫茫无际的戈壁沙漠，但是这些地区供水情况仍比较稳定，在荒漠中还有珍珠般的绿洲。这是什么道理呢？原来那里有几列高峻的山脉，祁连山、天山、昆仑山、阿尔泰山等耸立于雪线以上。数千条长年不化的冰川，像绵延不尽的银色波涛，披盖在高山顶部。冰川融水流下平地，形成几条稀疏的河流。数千条冰川，正像数千个高山水库。它常年累月的积聚冰雪，每当夏季农作物盛长季节，便融冰化雪，灌溉农田，供人应用。
    全世界冰川面积  占陆地十分之一
    冰川是地球表面一种特殊的自然复盖物。在高山顶部和南北极附近的长年寒冷地区，炎夏不消的雪线以上，新鲜雪积聚后，重新结晶，颗粒变粗成为粒雪，以后又转变为冰，当冰达到一定厚度时，由于重力作用和上层冰的压力，由于冰的可塑性，缓慢地流动起来，就成为冰川。每个冰川都有它自己的积累区（称为粒雪原）和消融区（多数呈舌状，称为冰舌）。粒雪原至冰舌的转变带，大体就是雪线所在。全世界冰川面积在一千五百万方公里左右，占陆地总面积的十分之一，分为大陆冰川与山地冰川两大类。南极洲、格陵兰岛和北极附近的岛屿和大陆上，地面整个为冰层复盖，称为大陆冰川。其面积占所有冰川面积95％以上。这些地区，终年酷寒，工农业的发展，受到极大限制，虽然冰川体积庞大，但经济意义很小。山地冰川分布在亚、欧、美、非、澳各洲的山地，位于山谷上部，比较零碎，总面积不到十万方公里。有些山地冰川在湿润地区，如亚洲喜马拉雅山与欧洲阿尔卑斯山的冰川，山麓平地，水流充足，没有再开发利用冰川的必要。在那里，冰川只作为探险、游览的对象。只有亚洲中部干旱区的山地的冰川，是山麓和山间平原灌溉水的直接源泉，才具有重大经济意义。苏联学者之所以对西部天山与帕米尔一带冰川作深入研究考察，并建立了几个著名的冰川观测站，就是因为这些冰川具有经济价值。但是苏联中亚地区不像我国西北部这样干燥，现有地面水源基本够用。因此，苏联学者虽然在高山冰川进行过融冰化雪试验，但并没有应用推广，把它作为扩大水源的重要手段。把高山冰川当作重要的经济资源，当作开发利用的对象，则应以我国为首创。
    我国冰川数量极多  科学研究还是空白
    我国山地冰川分布于西藏高原及其周围的山地（喜马拉雅山、喀喇昆仑山、昆仑山）和西北的祁连山、天山、阿尔泰山等处。由于我国高山面积的广大，高山冰川数量之多，可能占世界各国第一位。新疆天山的冰川面积与储水量虽然没有经过详细考察，但根据苏联学者的资料，仅中苏边境腾格里山冰川区（天山最大的冰川中心），冰川面积即达二千五百方公里，最大的山谷冰川长五十三公里，厚四百公尺，绵亘在塔里木盆地、柴达木盆地南缘的昆仑山，由于山系长大，冰川数量也不会少于天山。新疆与克什米尔边界上的喀喇昆仑山不但是亚洲也是全世界冰川最发达的高山，山脊整个为冰雪复盖，只有个别高峰露出冰面。总计上述干旱区的高山现代冰川，面积超出一万方公里，总储水量可能达到一万亿至二万亿公方（前年冬天以来，我国完成的一千五百九十二处水库工程蓄水量是二百五十九亿多公方。长江每年流入海的水量是一万亿公方）。世界冰川学的发展已有一百多年的历史，冰川在我国又具有特殊的经济意义，但在我国科学领域内，对现代冰川的研究，一向是个空白点，仅有的少量关于冰川的记述，也多出于外国探险家的手笔。我们自己完全不掌握冰川资源数量、物质平衡和冰川生活历史的资料。
    祁连山冰川储水量  初查达四百亿公方
    1958年工农业大跃进的形势与大规模治理沙漠、改造戈壁任务的提出，能否扩大西北干旱区的水源，包括扩大与提早冰川消融，就成为一个急待解决的问题。6月中，中国科学院地理研究所、地球物理研究所、兰州大学、西北大学、南京大学、甘肃和青海省水利厅与气象局等二十多个单位的人员组成了高山冰雪利用研究队，首先向祁连山现代冰川展开了坚决的进攻。一百多个从来没有接触过现代冰川、缺乏登山训练与相应装备的青年，在苏联专家勒·特·道尔古申的帮助下，和各有关部门的协作支持下，克服一切困难，在短短三个月时间，踏遍了祁连山各大山脉，基本上查明了祁连山现代冰川分布、类型与储水量，观测了冰川积累和消融的特征、冰川与河流补给的关系，通过实验与了解群众经验，探明了人工促进冰雪消融，扩大水源的可能性。并在海拔四千公尺左右的高山上，建立了两所高山站。
    祁连山由若干北西西走向平行的高山和谷地组成。山系长八百公里，宽二百到四百公里，最高峰海拔六千三百公尺。高山年降水量东段在七百毫米左右，西段只三百到四百毫米。雪线由东段北坡四千二百公尺左右向西逐渐上升到五千二百公尺左右。在雪线以上，每年降雪量大于消融量，新鲜雪盖首先变成颗粒状的粒雪，粒雪冻结受压渐变成细密的冰层，山坡冰层堆积到临界厚度，就向下运动，以舌状流到雪线以下，这样就形成了冰川。祁连山区的冰川可分成：一、山谷冰川（长大的冰舌伸入谷地），二、冰斗山谷冰川（过渡型），三、冰斗冰川（限于山坡凹处冰斗中，冰舌缩小），四、冰斗—悬冰川（过渡型），五、悬冰川（斜贴在陡峭的山坡上），六、平顶冰川（发育在平顶山上）等主要类型。冰川总数量在一千条以上，冰川总面积一千三百方公里左右，冰层厚度从几公尺以至一百余公尺，冰的密度为零点八到零点九，总储水量约达四百亿公方左右，相当于六百个十三陵水库，真是一项巨大的水利资源。
    冰川在冬季完全冻结起来，在夏季，不仅雪线以下的冰舌部分有旺盛的消融，就是雪线以上粒雪原中，白日中午，也有一定程度的消融。夏季又是一年中高山降雪最频繁的季节，随降随消就成为祁连山冰川的重要特征。冰川自然融水量，根据去年7、8、9月在十五个冰川考察重点所得的资料统计，平均每十方公里冰川面积融水量达一秒公方，整个祁连山区冰川自然融水总量估计在十亿公方左右。
    采取黑化冰川的办法  可以增加冰川融水量
    消融冰雪的热量主要来源于太阳辐射和空气与冰雪面间的热交换，不同的天气条件、地形条件、冰雪面污染情况与冰雪结构都对消融速度有影响。人类如果能够改变其中某些条件，就能够调节冰雪的消融程度。人类首先想到的就是在冰雪面撒黑色物质，减少对太阳辐射的反射，来促进消融。
    甘肃省敦煌县群众出于切身利害需要，从清朝末年就开始了人工黑化祁连山冰川增加融水量的工作。解放以来，每当4、5月缺水期间，就组织一百多人，远征二百公里以外冰川区进行融冰化雪。他们就地取牛、马、羊粪和杂草枯叶，燃烧成灰，撒在冰雪面上。去年出动群众一百六十人，黑化冰川面积达八方公里左右。高山冰雪利用研究队第六分队在小面积冰雪面喷撒炭黑和煤灰实验结果推算，每方公里冰川面经过黑化较未经黑化的，每日夜融水量多出一万公方左右，在气温零下五度或冰面温度零下八度界限以内，人工黑化都可起促进消融的效果。由此可知，人工调节冰雪消融，让冰川提前半个月以上下水，解决5、6月间农田用水不足的问题是完全可能的。中国科学院高山冰雪利用研究队准备在中共甘肃省委的统一领导下，与河西群众性水利工作结合起来，今年在祁连山十个以上地区，开展融冰化雪实验，争取扩大融水一亿至二亿公方，供灌溉三十到六十万亩土地用水。如果这项工作获得成功，循序以进，推广到天山、昆仑山等地区，在三、五年内，增加足够灌溉一千万亩土地的冰川融水量（约四十亿公方），是有希望的。
    当然，要使千万年来，人类可望而不可及的高山冰川驯服地为社会主义建设服务，目前还存在许多困难。就人工黑化办法促进冰雪消融而论，黑化一方公里冰川需要数十吨材料。由于高山冰川交通不便与高寒的自然条件的障碍，把这些材料搬上冰面，均匀撒布，不论用人力或飞机，都很费周折。其次，夏季冰面不时降雪，掩埋黑化材料，增加了工作的复杂性。第三，冰川下的河床都有相当严重的渗漏问题，与融冰化雪同时，必须举办防止渗漏工程。我们还没有深入地揭发各种不同条件下冰雪消融过程，因而也没有能开辟人工黑化以外融冰化雪的新途径。一定要把专业的科学研究与群众性融冰化雪工作结合起来，土洋并举，创造出经济、有效，为群众所掌握，便于大面积推广的融冰化雪方法。
    担心冰川没落  乃是杞人忧天
    有些杞人忧天论者，从第四纪冰期以后，世界各地冰川一般都处于退缩状态这个情况出发，担心着冰川没落的命运，认为不但不宜扩大冰雪消融，而且主张保护冰川。我们的看法则不同。祁连山现代冰川较第四纪冰川盛行时期，确已缩小。现代冰川末端，一般都在四千公尺以上，古代冰川末端遗迹则在三千公尺左右的高度即可找到。但目前冰川究竟在前进还是后退，还需作详细研究。我们曾发现若干冰川上有新鲜的前进中的活冰层超复在衰老的死冰层上的现象，即使多数冰川是在后退中，其速度也是非常缓慢的。现在融冰化雪工作规模还很小。对于巨大的冰川储水量来说，不是融冰化雪工作已经威胁了冰川的存在，而是目前还缺乏一种便宜有效的办法，让冰川扩大消融，为社会主义建设服务。如果真有那么一天，融冰化雪的规模扩大了，冰川的积累受到影响了，那时人类也可以一方面用人工黑化或其他方法促进冰川消融，另一方面也可以用人工降雪或其他方法增加冰川积累。我们相信，经过相当时期的努力，人类可以在一定程度上控制冰川的发生和发展，成为冰川的主人。
    研究利用高山冰川  促进新的学科发展
    高山冰雪利用工作的进展，不仅有着重大经济意义，还将带动着一系列学科的发展，甚至新学科的诞生。首先是以控制冰川发生发展为目标的新型的冰川学。其中包括冰川水文、冰川气象、冰川地貌与地质，冰雪结晶与构造研究等等。其次是由于冰川考察研究而联带产生的高山学。研究在高山特殊条件下的自然资源和气象、地貌、植被岩石风化、冻土、泥流作用等规律性。第三，从冰川水源出发，联系着人工降水，地面径流调节，地下水搜寻探勘，以水分循环、平衡与调节的理论为中心建立起统一的干旱区水源学。由此可知，只要科学工作者全力为国民经济服务，采取以任务带动学科的办法，仅仅高山冰雪研究一项，就能为有关科学特别是为地理学开辟广阔的前途。
    1959年是高山冰雪利用研究工作继续大跃进的一年。我们除了要在祁连山区开展大规模的融冰化雪实验以外，还要在天山和其他山区考察冰雪资源。我们今年不论是在经济效果方面和学术研究方面，都要取得更大的成果。
