    Talking about the Gregorian Calendar on New Year's Day

    In China, the first day of the year has long been referred to as "Yuandan" (New Year's Day). The "Book of Jin" states: "Emperor Zhuanxu took the first month of Mengchun as the beginning, when the Zhengshuo (first day of the lunar year) coincided with the beginning of spring." However, in the early days, it referred to the first day of the lunar new year, while the "Yuandan" we speak of today is the first day of the Gregorian calendar.

    The calendar commonly used by modern countries around the world is called the Gregorian calendar, the common era calendar, the new calendar, the Western calendar, or the Gregorian calendar. It is a calendar implemented by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. After this year, the Gregorian calendar replaced the "Julian calendar" (old calendar) implemented by Roman Emperor Julius Caesar in 46 BC. The Gregorian calendar takes the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun once as one year. Its length is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. Because it is not an integer, the length is adjusted, with some years being 366 days, called "leap years," and some years being 365 days, called "common years." This calendar is superior to the old Julian calendar, which was wrong by three days every four hundred years, as it is wrong by about three days every ten thousand years. It considers years divisible by four as "leap years," except for years ending in two zeros where the hundreds digit is not divisible by four. Because this calendar is based on the Earth's position relative to the Sun, its "twenty-four solar terms" are fixed: the solar terms in the first half of the year are mostly on the 6th and 21st of each month; those in the second half of the year are mostly on the 8th and 23rd of each month, with a difference of no more than one or two days.

    The Western calendar was introduced to China by the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) during the eighth year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1580). Matteo Ricci's "Taixi Calendar" should be the Julian calendar. The "Heavenly Calendar" implemented by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionized the Chinese lunar calendar by adopting the solar calendar, but it also made some revisions to it. The "Heavenly Calendar" included both the original Chinese "ganzhi" (sexagenary cycle) and the solar calendar's "worship day" (week), which can be called a "combined solar-lunar calendar." The "Heavenly Calendar" is a special calendar with a revolutionary spirit in the history of Chinese calendars. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Gregorian calendar and the era of the Republic of China were adopted from New Year's Day in 1912. On September 27, 1949, the first plenary session of the CPPCC decided: "The People's Republic of China shall adopt the Common Era for its chronology."

    The size of each month in the Gregorian calendar is fixed, but the cycle of weeks is not. How can we fix the days and weeks of each month in a year to facilitate people's work and rest? In 1958, Soviet newspapers widely discussed the new calendar for universal use, and one proposal was very popular: it set New Year's Day as Sunday, so the 1st of July and October would also be Sundays. The first month of each quarter, namely January, April, July, and October, are fixed at thirty-one days, and the rest are thirty days. In this way, fifty-two weeks (three hundred and sixty-four days) are fixed, and as a result, there is still one last day left, which is called "rest day." If it is a leap year, the last day of the first half of the year (June 30) will also be called "rest day." (Xi)

### 元旦话阳历

    元旦话阳历
    在我国，很早以前就指一年的头一天为“元旦”。“晋书”：“颛帝以孟春正月为元，其时正朔旦立春”。不过，早年间指的是夏历正月初一，而我们今天所说的“元旦”，是阳历新年的头一天。
    现代世界各国通用的历法叫做阳历、公历、新历、西历或格里果利历。它是1582年由罗马教皇格里果利十三世实行的历法。这一年以后，阳历代替了公元前46年由罗马皇帝朱里·恺撒所实行的“儒略历”（旧历）。阳历是以地球环绕太阳一周的时间算作一年。它的长度是三百六十五天五小时四十八分四十六秒多。由于它不是整数，所以把长短拉齐，有的年份是三百六十六天，称为“闰年”；有的年份是三百六十五天，称为“平年”。这种历法在每一万年中约错三天，比旧的儒略历每四百年就错三天优越。它把以四能除尽的年份算作“闰年”，但末尾有两个零，而百位数不能以四除尽的年份除外。由于这种历法是根据地球与太阳距离的位置而定，所以它的“二十四节气”是固定的：上半年的节气多在每月的6日、21日；下半年多在每月的8日、23日，即使相差也不过一两天。
    西洋历法是明朝万历八年（1580）由意大利传教士利玛窦（1552—1610）传进中国的。利玛窦的“泰西历法”当系儒略历。太平天国实行的“天历”，对中国的阴历起了革命，它采用了阳历，但对它也有所改订。“天历”中有中国原有的“干支”，也有阳历的“礼拜”（星期），可谓“阴阳合历”。“天历”在中国历法史上说来，是一个具有革命精神的特殊历法。辛亥革命后，从1912年元旦起采用中华民国纪年和阳历。1949年9月27日，政协第一届全体会议决议：“中华人民共和国的纪年采用公元”。
    阳历各月份的大小是固定了，但星期的循环并不固定，如何使一年当中每月的日子和星期固定下来，以便利人们的工作和休息呢？1958年中，苏联报纸广泛讨论了全世界通用的新日历问题，其中有一个方案很受人们欢迎：它把元旦那一天定为星期日，那末，7、10月的1日也都是星期日。每季度的头一月份，即1、4、7、10月份固定为三十一天，其余为三十天。这样，五十二个星期（三百六十四天）固定下来了，结果，还剩下最后的一天，把它称为“休息日”。如果赶上闰年，就把上半年的最后一天（6月30日）也称为“休息日”。（熙）
