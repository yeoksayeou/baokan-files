    Even a Screw Is Indispensable
    After reading the article "Long Live the Supporting Role" published on page 8 of the People's Daily on January 16th, I was deeply moved and impressed.
    I am currently working as a civil servant. After the Rectification Campaign and the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, and other construction endeavors last year, I have a clearer understanding of my current job.
    If the lead role in "The Legend of the White Snake" is Bai Niangzi and the supporting role is Xiao Qing, then my current work is probably even less significant than Xiao Qing; if the engine is the main component of a machine and the others are accessories, then my current work responsibility is just a tiny screw compared to these accessories. However, even this tiny screw, I believe, is indeed indispensable. Can the entire work proceed if only ministers, directors, section chiefs, and cadres are in the office, without cooks, drivers, boilermakers, telephone operators, messengers, and civil servants to do some specific clerical work? Of course, in doing anything, there is a distinction between primary and secondary, important and unimportant; in doing any revolutionary work, there is also a distinction between major and minor, complex labor and simple labor. However, from the perspective of building socialism, it is still a whole, and cannot be absolutely separated. Moreover, as long as one works without conditions and labors without regard to reward, one's moral character is noble. I am a civil servant and also a Communist Party member. I believe that I, as a Communist Party member, am just as glorious as other Communist Party members in leadership positions.
    However, before the Rectification Campaign or in its early stages, many of our civil servant comrades in the unit felt that they were doing work that served others and had no future. I myself felt the same way. Now, everyone has a clear understanding of their work, and therefore, they are full of energy. However, there are still some individuals who do not sufficiently recognize the importance of their work. These people still need the Party to conduct further persuasive educational work on them so that they can catch up with the advanced comrades.

    螺丝钉也少不了
    读了1月16日人民日报第八版登载的“配角万岁”一文，感动很大，印象很深。
    我现在作的是公务员工作。在经过了整风运动和去年工农业及其它各项建设事业的大跃进以后，对我目前的这一工作，有了更明确的认识。
    如果说“白蛇传”里面演白娘娘的是主角而小青是配角的话，那我现在所负的工作，和小青比较起来，恐怕还要差得更远；如果说一部机器的发动机是主件而其他都是配件的话，那我现在所负的工作责任和这些配件比较起来，只不过是一个极小的螺丝钉而已。然而，就是这一个极小的螺丝钉，我认为也确实是不能缺少的。光有部长、司长、科长、干部在办公，没有炊事员、汽车司机、锅炉工、电话员、通讯员以及公务员，来作一些具体的事务工作，整个工作能够进行吗？当然，作任何一件事情，是有主次之分、轻重之别的，干任何革命工作，也是有主要和次要、复杂劳动和简单劳动之分的。可是，从建设社会主义这一点来说，究竟还是一个整体，不能绝对地分开的。而且只要工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，作为一个人的道德品质来讲，就是高尚的。我是一个公务员，同时又是一个共产党员。我以为我这个共产党员和其他作领导工作的共产党员同样都是光荣的。
    但是，在整风运动以前或以后的初期，我们单位的很多公务员同志都认为自己作的是侍候人、没有前途的工作。我自己也是如此。现在，大家都对自己的工作有了明确的认识，因而干劲十足了。不过，也还有个别的人，对自己的工作的重要性认识不足。这样的人，还有待于党对他们作进一步的说服教育工作，迎头赶上先进的同志。
