Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 18th. A rally of 70,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi gathered in Ba Dinh Square today to warmly welcome the government delegation from the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl.

Hundreds of Vietnamese and East German flags fluttered over Ba Dinh Square, with huge portraits of President Wilhelm Pieck and Chairman Ho Chi Minh hanging in the center of the square.

The distinguished guests, accompanied by President Ho Chi Minh and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, cheers from the crowd shook the entire square.

Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a lengthy speech amidst the cheers of the masses. He said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, like the German Democratic Republic in Europe, is an outpost of the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the people of the German Democratic Republic are very concerned about the struggle of the Vietnamese people and support them from the bottom of their hearts. He said: The German people will always stand with the Vietnamese people.

Grotewohl said that the Soviet Union's draft peace treaty with Germany and various proposals on the German question contribute to the peaceful reunification of Germany and the elimination of the European war crisis.

Grotewohl condemned the US imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique for seriously violating the Geneva Accords, rejecting the repeated proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to unify Vietnam through consultation, and turning South Vietnam into a US imperialist military base. He said that the criminal conspiracy of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities has been resolutely opposed by the vast majority of the South Vietnamese people.

In his speech, Grotewohl praised the construction achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, saying that the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in all fields are a great inspiration to the people of the German Democratic Republic.

Speaking about the current situation in Germany, Grotewohl said that US imperialism and its accomplices are dividing Germany. But Germany must be unified, this is the will of the German people.

Grotewohl finally wished the unbreakable friendship between the German and Vietnamese people a long life!

Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, delivered a speech at the beginning of the meeting. He expressed a warm welcome on behalf of the people of Hanoi to the German guests. He pointed out the important role of the German Democratic Republic, together with other countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

Tran Duy Hung said that the Vietnamese people firmly believe that the people of the German Democratic Repubic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic, will certainly be able to realize their lofty and glorious tasks.

At the end of the meeting, the whole audience sang "Solidarity is Strength."
