Caring for People at All Times, Attending to Every Detail
Fudan University Takes Measures to Improve the Livelihood and Welfare of Teachers, Students, and Staff, Boosting Their Enthusiasm

    (Our Report) Shanghai Fudan University, while properly arranging teaching, labor, and scientific research, has taken a series of measures to improve the livelihood and welfare, ensuring that students and staff get adequate rest, sleep well, and eat well, thus boosting their enthusiasm for learning and work.

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward has greatly encouraged the teachers, students, and staff of Fudan University. In recent months, many students have been full of enthusiasm and high spirits in scientific research and labor production. The Party Committee of Fudan University promptly noticed this situation and held a special meeting a month and a half ago to study the living and rest issues of teachers, students, and staff. At the same time, a deputy secretary of the Party Committee was appointed to specifically lead this work. On the one hand, persuasive education was conducted for the enthusiastic young people, and on the other hand, specific regulations were made. Except for individual majors, the whole school implements a one, three, eight system of learning and labor; that is, one month of vacation per year, three months of labor, and eight months of learning. Senior students spend two to three months engaged in scientific research. The daily activities of students are also regulated: eight hours for classes and self-study, ten minutes for morning exercises, one hour for recreational and sports activities, four hours for meals and free time, and eight hours for sleep. In addition to rotating to the countryside and factories for centralized labor, students generally work eight hours per week on campus. During the labor period, the cumulative continuous labor per day does not exceed eight hours.

    Because the Party Committee has made comprehensive arrangements for all aspects of activities, teachers and students can usually get enough rest and sleep. Track and field, ball games, weightlifting, exercises, and competitions, as well as mass literary creation and performances, are generally active. In the movement to vigorously engage in scientific research and present gifts to the New Year before the year, the phenomenon of "burning the midnight oil" was eliminated. Students of the third grade of the Biology Department, while carrying out research on fish winter ovulation, seed storage, and other aspects, together with students of the Chinese Department, created the film script "Broad Road" with the experience of combining theory with practice as the central content. Since late November, students and staff throughout the school have created many literary works such as poems, features, essays, clappers, and crosstalk. The implementation of the labor-health system has also achieved great results. Huang Sijiu, a fourth-grade student, broke the national record in the city's marathon race.

    The Party Committee also personally took charge of the food work. After discovering that the quality of student meals had declined after the canteen system was changed to a contracted system, it immediately organized Party and government departments and the student union to conduct an inspection of this work. At the same time, a group of Party members, cadres, and activists were sent to strengthen the work of the student and staff public canteens. Under the education of the Party Committee, the canteen staff actively tried to find ways to increase the variety of dishes, raise more pigs, and make pickles by themselves. Nutritious dishes were set up in the student canteen for students who were weak or sick. A canteen specifically supplying pasta, porridge, and soft rice was also set up for patients with stomach problems. All this was praised by the masses.

    Medical and health care workers in the school also went to the dormitories, kitchens, and places where students participated in labor to strengthen health work. Recently, they also set up a simple medical station in the student dormitory. If students have minor illnesses, they do not have to go to the clinic to register and wait for treatment. As long as they sign at the simple clinic station, they can receive treatment immediately. (Yu Huiyin) (Attached Picture)

    时时刻刻关怀人　事无巨细都操心
    复旦大学采取措施搞好生活福利师生员工干劲更大
    本报讯　上海复旦大学在妥善安排教学、劳动和科学研究的同时，采取一系列措施搞好生活福利事业，保证学生和教职员工歇足睡好吃好，使得他们学习和工作的劲头更大。
    大跃进的形势使复旦大学师生员工受到极大的鼓舞，几个月以来；许多学生在大搞科学研究和劳动生产过程中，热情洋溢，干劲冲天。复旦大学党委及时注意到这一情况，在一个半月以前就针对师生员工的生活和休息问题专门开会进行了研究，同时指定一位党委副书记具体领导这方面的工作。一面对热情洋溢的青年人进行说服教育，一面作出了具体规定。全校除个别专业外，都实行了一、三、八的学习和劳动制度；即每年休假一个月，劳动三个月，学习八个月。高年级学生有二、三个月从事科学研究。并规定了学生每天活动的时间：上课和自学时间八小时，早操十分钟，文娱体育活动一小时，吃饭和自由支配时间四小时，睡眠八小时。除轮流下乡下厂集中劳动外，每周一般在校劳动八小时，参加劳动期间，每天连续劳动累计不超过八小时。
    由于党委对各方面的活动作了全面安排，平时师生们能够歇足睡好，田径、球类、举重，锻炼和比赛，群众性的文艺创作和演出普遍活跃起来。在年前大搞科学研究向元旦献礼的运动中，消除了“开夜车”的现象。生物系三年级的学生们一面开展了鱼类冬季排卵、种子贮藏等多方面的研究，一面和中文系的学生们一起，以理论联系实际的体会为中心内容，创作了电影剧本“宽广的道路”。11月下旬以来，全校学生和教职员工创作了许多诗歌、特写、散文、快板、相声等文艺作品。实行劳卫制也收到很大成绩。四年级学生黄思九在全市马拉松长跑赛中打破了全国纪录。
    党委还亲自抓了伙食工作，发现从食堂制改为包伙制后学生伙食质量下降的情况后，立即组织党政部门和学生会对这一工作进行了检查，同时派出一批党员干部和积极分子去加强学生和员工公共食堂的工作。在党委的教育下，食堂工作人员积极想办法增加饭菜的花色品种，多养生猪，自己动手做酱菜。在学生食堂里设立了供应体弱、有病学生的营养菜。还为胃病患者专门举办了一个供应面食、稀饭、软饭的食堂。这一切受到群众的赞扬。
    学校里的医务保健工作人员也下宿舍、下厨房，并到学生参加劳动的地方，加强卫生工作。最近他们又在学生宿舍办起了一个简易医疗站，学生有了小毛病，不必跑到医务所去挂号候诊，只要在简易诊疗站签个字，立刻就可以进行治疗。　（余辉音）（附图片）
