According to the Gansu Daily, Gansu Province recently decided that all regions within the province can, based on their specific circumstances, extract one-quarter or one-third of their labor force to form specialized teams to engage in a high tide of manure collection, expand sideline production, strengthen field management, and reform tools.

Currently, a winter production high tide with water conservancy, manure collection, sideline production, and field management as its main content is developing vigorously in the rural areas of Gansu Province, combined with the rectification of communes. By the end of last December, the province had collected more than 147 billion jin of farm manure, an increase of three or four times compared to the same period in 1957; and manufactured more than 33 billion jin of various types of local chemical fertilizers, an average of more than 600 jin per mu of land. Sideline production has also been widely carried out in various regions. According to statistics from four special districts (autonomous prefectures) and three counties, income has already exceeded 25 million yuan. The Changba People's Commune in Wudu organized three specialized teams to engage in sideline production, and in the last month of last year alone, income exceeded 350,000 yuan, greatly increasing the commune's cash income and supplying the needs of cities for non-staple foods and daily necessities. In terms of tool reform, great achievements have also been made. The province has created more than 15,000 kinds of tools, manufactured and promoted more than 8 million pieces, and manufactured more than 3.4 million sets of ball bearings.

This year, Gansu Province will have an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Agriculture needs to create large areas of high-yield land, and the output of general fields must also be higher than in previous years, requiring a significant increase in the amount of fertilizer, especially a significant improvement in quality. Manure collection and fertilizer production are therefore particularly important. Therefore, the provincial party committee requires that all regions and communes conduct an inspection and accounting based on this year's planting area and fertilizer application plan, clarify the foundation, formulate a plan, and organize forces to make up for any deficiencies. Manure collection should focus on both farm manure and local chemical fertilizers, and close attention should be paid to fertilizer quality. Regions can extract one-quarter or one-third of the labor force to form specialized teams to engage in a high tide of manure collection, and fully utilize various vehicles and high-line transportation tools to transport fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner. In order to enable communes to have more cash income and increase market supply, in terms of sideline production, the provincial party committee also requires all regions to launch mass movements according to local conditions, especially to focus on non-staple food production, agricultural product processing, local sugar production, hunting wild birds and animals, and so on, and to vigorously promote the raising of fat pigs.

Regarding tool reform, according to the spirit of the provincial party committee's instructions, the current focus is on transportation tools, farming tools, and local mechanization. Damaged vehicles should be repaired before the Spring Festival. Each commune should also add an average of 200 vehicles, and those without ball bearings must be installed. All regions should seize the time to carefully study and create tools for close planting, and vigorously promote successful experiences, such as the "land boat" and "local train" of the Yintao construction site, to achieve local mechanization.

According to the Jilin Daily, the Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jilin held an enlarged meeting on January 2nd with the participation of the first secretaries of the township party committees to arrange the current tasks of manure collection, water conservancy, and sideline production.

Since the beginning of winter, Yushu County has achieved certain results in manure collection, water conservancy, and sideline production. According to statistics, 32.91 million tons of manure have been collected, completing 34.6% of the manure collection plan; water conservancy projects have completed more than 844,500 cubic meters of earthwork; and sideline production has also achieved great results. However, due to the heavy rural work tasks and lack of leadership experience, the current work arrangements have not been good enough, and there have been phenomena of neglecting one thing for another in some aspects. At the enlarged meeting, the current work was discussed, and everyone believed that the land has been deeply plowed, and only more manure application can guarantee increased production; water conservancy is also an important link in increasing production. Due to the small amount of snow in winter, according to meteorological forecasts, there will be less rain in spring, and drought may occur. Therefore, we must pay attention to extracting groundwater. Based on this situation, it was decided that the county would use more than 70,000 people to focus on building two reservoirs that can benefit the same year and drilling more wells, while other projects can be temporarily suspended in order to extract more than 40,000 people from water conservancy to participate in manure collection. In this way, more than 84,000 people will participate in manure collection, accounting for 35% of the total labor force. Adding the number of people manufacturing local chemical fertilizers, it can reach more than 40%, ensuring the completion of the manure collection task. At the same time, arrangements were also made for sideline production, deciding to use 80,000 people to engage in sideline production, combining temporary sideline production with year-round sideline production. In terms of labor organization, technical expertise and physical condition should be taken into consideration. Young and middle-aged male laborers should engage in transportation, fishing, and hunting, while the elderly and women should mainly engage in weaving and raising poultry. In addition, arrangements were also made for commune industry, the end of autumn harvest, and other work.

After the county party committee's enlarged meeting, all forty townships in the county held meetings with the participation of four or five hundred people (party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres above the production team leader level) to convey the spirit of the meeting and then make arrangements for the current work. At present, winter production in the county is moving towards a high tide.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 19th. The people's communes in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, have reversed their usual habit of emphasizing autumn (harvest) over summer (harvest) and strengthened the winter management of summer harvest crops. After a concentrated topdressing of fertilizer in late December last year, the county organized more than 110,000 people to cover the summer harvest crops with fertilizer for warmth. Of the county's 680,000 mu of summer harvest crops, 62% have been topdressed twice, 22% have been topdressed three times, and the rest have been topdressed once. Now the county's wheat and rapeseed are lush green, and the growth situation is better than in any previous year, with 55% becoming first-class seedlings and only 14% being third-class seedlings.

Recently, the communes in Huangpi County have combined the discussion of the "Ten Proposals," and some communes have reorganized their labor force and launched another crop upgrading campaign. In order to upgrade all the wheat and rapeseed seedlings to first-class seedlings, the Caidian People's Commune established 810 field management professional groups with 7,500 fixed laborers specifically responsible for cultivating and managing more than 48,000 mu of winter-sown crops.

At present, Huangpi County has established more than 5,400 professional groups responsible for field management of summer harvest crops. These professional groups have high labor efficiency and can save labor because of their clear responsibilities and the ability to give play to each person's expertise. (Picture attached)

    树立全局观点　分别轻重缓急　合理调配力量
    增添劳力加强农业主攻战线
    甘肃等地根据当前需要大抓积肥、副业和田间管理
    据甘肃日报消息　甘肃省最近决定：省内各地可根据具体情况，抽出四分之一或三分之一的劳动力组成专业队投入积肥高潮，并扩大副业生产、加强田间管理和工具改革。
    目前，甘肃省农村中一个以水利、积肥、副业生产、田间管理为主要内容的冬季生产高潮，正结合整社工作蓬勃发展着。到去年12月底，全省已积农家肥一万四千七百多亿斤，比1957年同时期增加了三、四倍；制造各种土化肥三百三十多亿斤，平均每亩地有六百多斤。副业生产也在各地普遍开展起来，据四个专区（自治州）和三个县的统计，已收入二千五百多万元。武都长坝人民公社，组织了三个专业队搞副业生产，在去年最后一个月里就收入三十五万多元，大大增加了公社现金收入，供应了城市副食品和日常用品的需要。在工具改革方面，也取得了巨大成就，全省创造工具一万五千多种，制造推广了八百多万件，并制造滚珠轴承三百四十多万套。
    今年，甘肃省将要有一个更大、更好、更全面的跃进。农业要搞大面积丰产地，一般田的产量也要高过往年，需要肥料的数量大大增加、特别是质量要大大提高，积肥、造肥就显得特别重要。因此，省委要求各地各个公社根据今年播种面积和用肥计划，进行一次检查算账、摸清底子、订出计划，组织力量突击补足。积肥要农家肥、土化肥同时抓，还要密切注意肥料质量。各地可以抽出四分之一或三分之一的劳力组成专业队投入积肥高潮，并充分利用各种车辆和高线运输工具，将肥料及时运到地里。为了使公社有更多的现金收入和增加市场供应，在副业生产方面，省委还要求各地因地制宜大搞群众运动，特别要抓副食品生产、农产品加工、土法制糖、打野禽野兽等等，并大量催育肥猪。
    关于工具改革，根据省委指示精神，当前主要抓运输工具、耕作工具和土机械化，将损坏的车辆赶春节前全部修补好。每个公社平均还要添制二百辆，没有滚珠轴承的必须装上。各地要抓紧时间，很好地研究创造密植工具，还要大力推广成功的经验，如引洮工地的“旱船”、“土火车”等，实现土机械化。
    据吉林日报消息　中共吉林榆树县委于1月2日召开了有乡党委第一书记参加的扩大会议，对当前积肥、水利和副业生产等进行了安排。
    入冬以来，榆树县在积肥、水利和副业生产方面取得了一定的成绩。据统计，积攒粪肥三千二百九十一万吨，完成积肥计划的34.6％；水利工程完成八十四万四千五百多土方；副业生产也有很大成绩。但是，由于农村工作任务繁重，缺乏领导经验，对当前工作安排得还不够好，在某些方面有顾此失彼的现象。在扩大会议上，对当前工作进行了讨论，大家认为，土地都经过深翻了，只有多施粪肥才能保证增产；修水利也是增产的重要环节，由于冬季雪小，根据气象预报，春季又少雨，可能发生干旱，因此必须注意提取地下水。根据这个情况，决定全县除用七万多人集中修建两座当年能受益的水库和多打井以外，其它几处工程可以暂缓兴建，以便从水利方面抽出四万多人参加积肥。这样，参加积肥的将有八万四千人，占劳动力总数的35％，加上制造土化肥的人数，能达到40％以上，使完成积肥任务有了保证。同时对副业生产也做了安排，决定用八万人从事副业生产，把临时性的副业同常年副业结合起来。在劳动力组织上，要照顾到技术专长和身体状况。青壮年男劳动力多搞运输、打鱼、打猎，老年人及妇女主要是搞编织和饲养家禽等。此外，对公社工业、秋收结尾等工作也作了安排。
    县委扩大会议结束后，全县四十个乡都召开了有四五百人（党团员和生产组长以上的干部）参加的大会，作了传达，然后对当前工作作了安排。目前全县冬季生产正走向高潮。
    本报武汉19日电　湖北省黄陂县各人民公社一反往常重秋（收）轻夏（收）习惯，加强夏收作物过冬的管理。全县从去年12月下旬突击追肥一次后，又组织十一万多人给夏收作物盖肥保温。这个县的六十八万亩夏收作物，有62％追过两次肥，22％追过三次肥，其余的都追了一次肥。现在全县的小麦、油菜一片葱绿，生长情况比过去任何一年都好，有55％成为一类苗，三类苗只占14％。
    最近，黄陂县各个公社结合讨论“十大倡议”，有些公社已重新安排了劳力，又一次开展作物升级运动。蔡店人民公社为使麦苗、油菜全部升为一类苗，全公社建立八百一十个田间管理专业组，固定了七千五百个劳力专门负责培育管理四万八千多亩冬播作物。
    现在，黄陂全县已建立了五千四百多个负责夏收作物田间管理的专业组。这些专业组由于责任分明，又能发挥各人专长，故劳动效率高，可以省工。（附图片）
