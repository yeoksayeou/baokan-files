Comrades:

I represent the literary and art workers of Beijing to say a few words. Human history is changing its face: oppressed nations all over the world are struggling against imperialism and for national independence. This is an extremely great historical torrent, irresistible! Whoever dares to try to resist it will fail, will die! Look: the people of Cuba and the Congo are fighting heroically! Listen: the people of Cuba and the Congo are uttering righteous roars! We support their just struggle, salute them, and firmly believe that final victory will be theirs!

The imperialists have always used the most vicious means to oppress others, while constantly shouting "freedom," "freedom"! As if they were the embodiment of the beautiful goddess of freedom. They shout at the top of their voices about the "free world"; "freedom" this, "freedom" that. Look, what are they doing? They are robbing other people's wealth and interfering in other people's internal affairs. Isn't this what U.S. imperialism is doing to Cuba? Their so-called "freedom" means that they have the privilege to run rampant and domineer, while others are not allowed to have food to eat or pants to wear! Their means of defending "freedom" is to open fire and shoot anyone who doesn't listen to them! Isn't Belgium doing this in the Congo now? Brave people of Cuba and the Congo, you have clearly seen the faces of the imperialists, no longer deceived and oppressed. The Chinese people support you, and all justice-loving people in the world support you!

What is true freedom? It is national independence, each nation handling its own affairs in its own way, without interference from others, and not allowing interference from others! The imperialists' cry of "freedom" is the greatest insult to freedom, and we should slap them hard in the face!

Can the imperialists' mouths be slapped? We say: We must slap them in the face! Imperialism and colonialism are the most rotten and reactionary things of today. We must not only slap them in the face, but also drive them out of the earth!

What happens after slapping the imperialists in the face? The imperialists are all paper tigers! They come in different lengths and sizes, but they are all made of paper. If you don't dare to touch them, they are very arrogant, baring their teeth and claws, and lording it over everywhere. If you dare to touch them, they will tuck their tails between their legs and flee in panic. Justice is always invincible!

The anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and national independence movements are already surging like an irresistible torrent. They are surging in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Don't talk about paper tigers, even if they were meat tigers, they would be drowned one by one! Our era is the era when oppressed nations are standing up one by one. The era when paper tigers flaunted their power will never return.

Only when all nations in the world achieve freedom and independence will there be a happy world, a peaceful world! Imperialism and colonialism must be eliminated!

All the literary and art workers of Beijing stand together with the people of the whole country to support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people! We congratulate them on their victory! Justice prevails, and then there will be peace! We are determined to have world peace, and therefore firmly support the just struggle for national independence and freedom!

Long live the heroic people of the world who are fighting for national independence!

Long live world peace!

    我们的时代是被压迫民族翻身的时代
    北京市文学艺术工作者代表舒舍予的讲话同志们：
    我代表北京市文艺工作者说几句话。人类历史正在改变面貌：全世界受压迫的民族都在为反对帝国主义、争取民族独立，进行斗争。这是一个极大极大的时代洪流，无可抗拒！谁敢妄想抗拒，谁失败，谁死亡！看：古巴人民与刚果人民正在英勇奋斗！听：古巴人民与刚果人民正在发出正义的吼声！我们支持他们的正义斗争，向他们致敬，深信最后胜利必是他们的！
    帝国主义者一向是用最毒恶的手段压迫别人，而嘴里不断地吆喝
  “自由”，“自由”！倒好像他们是美丽的自由神的化身。他们扯着脖子喊“自由世界”；“自由”这个，“自由”那个。看吧，他们干的是什么呢？是抢劫别人家的财富，干涉别人家的内政，美帝对古巴不就是这样么？他们所谓的“自由”就是他们有横行霸道的特权，而不准别人有饭吃，有裤子穿！他们保卫“自由”的手段就是谁不听话，他们就开炮开枪！现在，比利时在刚果不就是这样么？英勇的古巴与刚果人民，你们看清楚了帝国主义者的这副嘴脸，不再受欺骗与压迫，中国人民支持你们，全世界有正义感的人民都支持你们！
    什么是真正自由？是民族独立，每个民族按照自己的办法去处理自己家里的事，不受别人干涉，不许别人干涉！帝国主义者喊叫“自由”是对自由的最大污辱，我们该狠狠地打他的嘴巴！
    帝国主义者的嘴可打得么？我们说：非打嘴巴不可！帝国主义、殖民主义是今天的最腐臭的、最反动的东西，我们岂止要打他的嘴巴，而且必须把他从地球上轰出去！
    打了帝国主义者的嘴巴，怎样呢？帝国主义者都是纸老虎啊！他们的长短大小不同，可都是纸糊的。你不敢碰他，他可神气咧，张牙舞爪，到处发威。你敢碰他，他就夹起尾巴，落荒而逃，正义永远是无敌的！
    反帝、反殖民主义，和争取民族独立的运动已然是波涛汹涌，无可抗拒的洪流。在亚洲、非洲，和拉丁美洲都在澎湃激荡。不要说纸老虎，就是肉老虎也来一个淹死一个！我们的时代是被压迫的民族一个一个站起来的时代，纸老虎耀武扬威的时代一去不复返了。
    只有全世界各民族都取得自由独立，才会有幸福的世界，和平的世界！帝国主义、殖民主义必须消灭！
    北京市全体文艺工作者与全国人民在一起支持古巴人民与刚果人民的正义斗争！祝贺他们的胜利！正义伸张，才会和平！我们坚决地要世界和平，也就坚决地支持民族独立自由的正义斗争！
    全世界争取民族独立的英勇人民万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
