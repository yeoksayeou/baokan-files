Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, January 28th: The Baghdad Pact Council concluded its three-day meeting in Karachi today. The meeting focused on the signing of new bilateral military agreements and the issue of U.S. aid to these remaining member states of the treaty, but the results of the three-day meeting showed that no results were achieved on either of these issues.

The situation at this meeting shows that the main purpose of the United States is to carry out new military deployments, plot new aggressive conspiracies, and arrange new offensives against the people of the Middle East. This can be clearly seen from the main issues discussed at the meeting, such as the "Iraqi problem" and the signing of bilateral military agreements between the United States and the three Muslim member states.

The communiqué issued at the meeting stated that negotiations on the signing of bilateral military agreements between the United States and Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan "are in progress." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said on the 27th that he "hopes to sign them in the near future." The communiqué also stated that the "central military organization" of this aggressive military bloc "should be strengthened. A proposal to achieve this goal has been submitted to the Ministerial Council for detailed discussion and implementation." In addition, the communiqué also revealed that the meeting also discussed the issue of the connection between this military bloc and other aggressive blocs manipulated by the United States.

However, the United States did not smoothly promote these plans at this meeting. It originally hoped that its bilateral military agreements with the three Muslim member states could be signed before the meeting closed, but the agreements could not be signed because the differences between it and the three Muslim member states could not be resolved.

At this meeting, the three Muslim countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey expressed great dissatisfaction with the United States for failing to fulfill its promises to help them solve their economic difficulties. The fragile financial economies of these countries have fallen into an increasingly deep crisis due to the heavy obligations of military expansion.

To this end, the representatives of the three countries voiced many complaints at and outside the meeting. The Prime Minister of Iran and the Prime Minister of Turkey emphasized in their speeches that in addition to military "defense," the economic strength of the treaty member states must also be strengthened. The Prime Minister of Iran accused the Baghdad Pact Organization of failing to complete its important tasks and "failing to realize economic development plans," which would lead to "serious consequences." He complained that the United States had "devalued" the group. This kind of dispute was already very obvious at the economic committee meeting before the Council meeting. The Pakistani Minister of Finance said at the meeting that Pakistan "attaches utmost importance to the economic activities of the Baghdad Pact and regards this as the main reason why this treaty needs to exist." Iranian representative Amuzegar angrily pointed out that some engineering agreements between Iran and the United States regarding economic construction have been signed for two years, but today "we are still going around in circles preparing investigation reports or research reports." Despite these representatives' full of complaints, the United States, which demanded greater control over these countries, firmly stated at the meeting that the United States did not have more funds available. Because the discussion of economic assistance issues yielded no results, the meeting was filled with an atmosphere of disappointment and displeasure.

### 巴格达集团会议不欢而散  穆斯林成员国在经济问题上怨声载道  美国推行侵略中东的新计划未有进展

    巴格达集团会议不欢而散
    穆斯林成员国在经济问题上怨声载道
    美国推行侵略中东的新计划未有进展
    据新华社28日讯　卡拉奇消息：巴格达条约理事会经过三天会议今天在卡拉奇闭幕。会议着重讨论了签订新的双边军事协定和美国对这些条约残余成员国援助的问题，但是三天的会议结果表明，会议在这两个问题上没有取得结果。
    这次会议的情况表明，美国的主要目的是进行新的军事部署，策划新的侵略阴谋，对中东人民布置新的进攻。这从会议讨论的主要问题是“伊拉克问题”以及有关签订美国同三个穆斯林成员国之间的双边军事协定等问题就可以清楚地看出来。
    会议发表的公报说，关于美国同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订双边军事协定的谈判“正在进行中”。美国国务卿杜勒斯27日说，他“希望在不久将来签订”。会议公报还说，这个侵略性军事集团的“中央军事机构应该加强。一项有关实现这个目标的建议已经提交部长代表会议详细讨论并付诸实施”。另外，公报也透露，这次会议还讨论了这个军事集团同美国操纵的其他侵略集团之间的联系问题。
    但是美国在这次会上推行这些计划时并不顺利。它原希望它同三个穆斯林成员国的双边军事协定可以在会议闭幕之前签订，但是由于它同三个穆斯林成员国的分歧无法得到解决，协定未能签订。
    在这次会议上，伊朗、巴基斯坦和土耳其三个穆斯林国家对于美国没有履行诺言来帮助它们解决经济困难表示非常不满。这些国家脆弱的财政经济由于承担了沉重的扩军义务而陷入日益深重的危机。
    为此，三国代表在会上和会下发出很多怨言。伊朗首相和土耳其总理发言时一致强调除了军事“防御”的方面还必须加强条约成员国的经济力量。伊朗首相指责巴格达条约集团没有完成它的重要任务，
  “没有实现经济发展计划”，这样下去将要产生“严重的后果”。他埋怨美国“贬值了”这个集团。这方面的争吵在理事会会前的经济委员会会议上已表现得很明显。巴基斯坦财政部长在会上说，巴基斯坦“十二万分地重视巴格达条约的经济活动，并且把这看作是这个条约有存在的必要的主要理由”。伊朗代表阿穆泽加尔愤慨地指出，伊朗同美国之间关于经济建设的一些工程协定已经签订了两年，但是今天“我们仍旧在准备调查报告或研究报告方面兜圈子”。尽管这些代表满口怨言，要求对这些国家取得更大控制的美国在会上坚决表示美国没有更多资金可供支配。由于经济援助问题讨论没有结果，会议充满着失望和不愉快的气氛。
