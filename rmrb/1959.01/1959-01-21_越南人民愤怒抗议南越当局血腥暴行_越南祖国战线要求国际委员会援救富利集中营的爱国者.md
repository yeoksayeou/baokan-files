Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: A mass demonstration and parade of approximately 15,000 people was held in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this afternoon, protesting the mad atrocities of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique in the Phu Loi concentration camp, where over a thousand political prisoners were poisoned and killed in their food.

The kilometer-long demonstration shouted slogans on the streets such as "Down with the American imperialist lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique!", "Immediately disband the death camps of South Vietnam!", "American imperialists get out of South Vietnam!", "We demand the International Commission immediately investigate the Phu Loi mass murder incident!". Many pedestrians on the streets also angrily shouted slogans along with the demonstrators.

Participants in the demonstration included teachers and students from various universities and colleges such as the Medical College and the Minority Nationalities Normal College, as well as staff from the Vietnam Education Trade Union and the Ministry of Education.

The demonstrators sent three delegations to the Hanoi office of the International Commission and submitted one hundred and fifteen petitions. The petitions demanded an immediate investigation into this crime.

Since yesterday, after hearing the news that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique had poisoned more than a thousand patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp, the angry people of North Vietnam have held many rallies in succession to protest this insane crime, and have submitted hundreds of petitions to the International Commission, demanding it quickly intervene to rescue those still alive in the concentration camp and investigate this incident as soon as possible.

In the past two days, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in Hung Yen, Ha Dong and other places in North Vietnam have held rallies to protest the South Vietnamese authorities' crime of murdering more than a thousand former resistance personnel and patriots. This mass protest activity is expanding daily.

Many people spoke with great indignation and fervor at the protest rallies, unanimously pointing out that the people will never forgive this crime, and that bloody atrocities can only arouse greater anger among the people and make them more determined to fight for the unification of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front held an enlarged meeting on the afternoon of the 19th regarding the South Vietnamese authorities' poisoning of more than a thousand former resistance personnel and patriotic figures in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and representatives of various parties and people's organizations attended the meeting.

After listening to the report on the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre, the meeting established a "Phu Loi Massacre Struggle Committee" composed of twenty-nine prominent Vietnamese figures including Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Phan Van Chuong, Duong Bach Mai, Le Thi Xuyen, and Duong Duc Hien.

The meeting passed a "Suggestion to the International Commission," requesting the International Commission to conduct an on-site investigation into this incident and take emergency measures to rescue the political prisoners still alive in the Phu Loi concentration camp. The meeting selected a delegation composed of Le Dinh Tham and others to submit the suggestion to the Hanoi office of the International Commission in Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th: Hanoi newspapers today published editorials and commentaries strongly condemning the crime of the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem authorities for poisoning more than a thousand political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam on December 1, 1958.

The "People's Daily" editorial stated that the South Vietnamese authorities' inhumane act of murder once again exposed their true colors of harming the country and the people. In recent years, the South Vietnamese authorities have continuously murdered countless former resistance personnel and other patriotic figures in South Vietnam.

The editorial said that the South Vietnamese authorities' atrocities will not only fail to save them from their doom and weaken the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, but on the contrary, it will inevitably make the flames of anger of the entire Vietnamese people burn ever more fiercely.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people demand that the International Commission express its attitude towards this incident and take measures as soon as possible to rescue those still alive in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The "Capital Hanoi Daily" editorial pointed out, "The Phu Loi concentration camp massacre shows the people of the world that the atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are no different from the fascist crimes of Hitler and Mussolini in the past." The editorial said that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's policy of violence cannot suppress the will of the people, but on the contrary, it can only make them more isolated.

    越南人民愤怒抗议南越当局血腥暴行
    越南祖国战线要求国际委员会援救富利集中营的爱国者
    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国首都河内今天下午举行了有大约一万五千人参加的大示威游行，抗议美国—吴庭艳集团在富利集中营，在饭里放毒杀害了一千多名政治犯的疯狂暴行。
    长达一公里的示威队伍在大街上高呼“打倒美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳集团！”“立即解散南越的死亡营！”“美帝国主义者滚出南越！”“我们要求国际委员会立即调查富利集体屠杀事件！”等口号。大街上许多行人也愤怒地和示威者一起高呼口号。
    参加示威的有医学院、少数民族师范学院等各高等学校的教师和学生，越南教育工会和教育部的工作人员等。
    示威者派遣了三个代表团到国际委员会河内办事处，并且递交了一百一十五份呼吁书。呼吁书要求立即调查这个罪行。
    自从昨天在听到美国—吴庭艳集团毒死了在富利集中营的一千多名爱国者的消息以后，愤怒的越南北方人民接连举行了许多集会，抗议这个疯狂罪行，并且向国际委员会提出了数以百计的呼吁书，要求它迅速进行干预，以拯救集中营里还活着的人，并且早日调查这个事件。
    两天来，越南北方的兴安、河东等地各界人民成万人分别举行集会，抗议南越当局杀害了一千多名前抗战人员和爱国者的罪行。这种群众性的抗议活动正在日益扩大。
    许多人在抗议集会上非常愤慨和激昂地发了言，他们一致指出，人民绝不会饶恕这种罪行，血腥的暴行只能激起人民更大的愤怒，使人民更坚决地为祖国的统一而进行斗争。
    新华社河内20日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会19日下午就南越当局用毒药杀害富利集中营中一千多名前抗战人员和爱国人士事件举行了扩大会议。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜、越南总工会主席黄国越、越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探和各党派、人民团体的代表等出席了会议。
    会议在听取了关于富利集中营惨案的报告之后，成立了由越南知名人士阮春水、潘文章、杨白梅、黎氏钏、杨德贤等二十九人组成的“富利惨案斗争委员会”。
    会议通过了“给国际委员会的建议书”，要求国际委员会就这一事件进行现场调查，并且采取紧急措施援救富利集中营里还活着的政治犯。会议选出了由黎廷探等人组成的代表团，把建议书交给越南国际委员会河内办事处。
    新华社河内19日电　河内各报今天纷纷发表社论和评论，强烈谴责南越吴庭艳当局在1958年12月1日在饭食里放毒害死南越富利集中营一千多名政治犯的罪行。
    “人民报”社论说，南越当局这种灭绝人性的杀人罪行再一次暴露了他们祸国殃民的真面目。几年来，南越当局就曾经不断地害死了不知多少前抗战人员和南越其他爱国人士。
    社论说，南越当局的暴行不但不能挽救他们的厄运和削弱南越人民的斗争，相反地，它必将使越南全体人民的怒火越烧越旺。
    社论最后说，越南人民要求国际委员会对这个事件表示态度，并且及早采取措施，来挽救富利集中营里还活着的人。
    “首都河内报”社论指出，“富利集中营惨案向全世界人民指出了吴庭艳当局的暴行同过去希特勒、墨索里尼的法西斯罪行毫无差别。”社论说，吴庭艳集团的暴力政策并不能镇压人民的意志，恰恰相反，这只能使它们更加孤立。
