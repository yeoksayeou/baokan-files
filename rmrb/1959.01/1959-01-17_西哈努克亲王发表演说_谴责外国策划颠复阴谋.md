Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, January 15th: Prince Sihanouk, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, revealed in a speech delivered in Kampong Cham Province on the 13th that a foreign conspiracy against Cambodia was recently plotted in Bangkok.

Prince Sihanouk said that some Cambodian traitors, such as Son Ngoc Thanh (former leader of the Cambodian Democratic Party), participated in this conspiracy. These traitors were bought by foreigners to serve foreign interests.

Sihanouk pointed out that the conspiracy included three points:

First, to establish an opposition party in Cambodia to undermine national unity, attack the King of Cambodia and Sihanouk, in order to weaken the forces supporting neutrality and reduce the prestige of the King and Sihanouk.

Sihanouk said that the so-called Democratic People's Party, recently established under the leadership of Sang Sary, openly declared its support for a republican system and opposition to the monarchical system.

Second, to create domestic turmoil in order to spread unease among the people. Some signs, such as kidnappings, have already appeared.

Sihanouk said he had been told that these elements were being provided with weapons and incited to organize military actions to overthrow the government.

Third, to use Cambodians to fight against Cambodians.

Sihanouk said that he had been told that, in addition to two neighboring countries, a certain country was providing funds and weapons to support this conspiracy.

This is the first time that Prince Sihanouk has exposed the activities of the Sang Sary group. He said that this group is composed of some dismissed corrupt officials.

Prince Sihanouk revealed that when Sang Sary served as an advisor to the Prime Minister in 1957, he had colluded with the Americans. He said that when Sang Sary had to decide on certain matters, he would consult with the American ambassador to Cambodia in order to make a decision. On certain issues unfavorable to Cambodia, Sang Sary agreed with the American views.

Prince Sihanouk said that foreign conspiracies are doomed to failure. If we maintain unity, no one can realize this conspiracy. He pointed out that foreign countries do not dare to openly attack Cambodia, so they carry out conspiracies, which shows their failure.

    西哈努克亲王发表演说
    谴责外国策划颠复阴谋
    新华社金边15日电　柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王13日在磅湛省发表演说时，揭露最近外国在曼谷策划的反对柬埔寨的阴谋。
    西哈努克亲王说，有一些柬埔寨的卖国贼，例如山玉成（前柬埔寨民主党领袖），参与了这一阴谋。这些卖国贼被外国人收买过去为外国人的利益服务。
    西哈努克指出，这个阴谋包括三点：
    第一，在柬埔寨国内建立一个反对党来破坏全国的团结，攻击柬埔寨国王和西哈努克，以便削弱支持中立的力量，并且降低国王和西哈努克的威望。
    西哈努克说，最近成立的以桑·萨里为首的所谓民主人民党公开宣布赞成共和制度，反对君主制度。
    第二，制造国内混乱，以便在人民中间扩大不安情绪。已经出现了一些像绑架之类的迹象。
    西哈努克说，有人告诉他说，有人向这些分子提供武器，并且唆使他们组织军事行动来推翻政府。
    第三，用柬埔寨人来反对柬埔寨人。
    西哈努克说，有人告诉他，除了两个邻国以外，还有某个国家提供经费和武器来支持这个阴谋。
    这是西哈努克亲王第一次揭露桑·萨里集团的活动。他说，这个集团是由一些被撤职的贪污官员组成的。
    西哈努克亲王揭露，当桑·萨里在1957年担任首相顾问时，就曾经同美国人勾结。他说，在桑·萨里要决定某些事的时候，他就去同美国驻柬埔寨大使去磋商，以作出决定。在某些不利于柬埔寨的问题上，桑·萨里同意美国的看法。
    西哈努克亲王说，外国的阴谋注定是要失败的。如果我们保持团结，谁也不能实现这个阴谋。他指出，外国不敢公开攻击柬埔寨，所以它们就进行阴谋活动，这就表明了它们的失败。
