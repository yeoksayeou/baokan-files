    A Leap in the Development of Rural Industries

    Not long ago, rural industries in our country were few and far between. When people talked about them, they were nothing more than rice mills, flour mills, noodle shops, wineries, and tofu shops. Now, rural industries in our country are developing by leaps and bounds. According to incomplete statistics from January to September 1958, the number of industrial and mining enterprises built by counties and townships in our country reached 6.68 million (after the realization of people's communes nationwide in October, this number was far exceeded), including metallurgical industry, machinery industry, coal industry, petroleum industry, building materials industry, textile industry, rice and grain processing industry, daily necessities light industry, food industry, and other light and heavy industries. These industries are widely distributed, from plains to mountains, from hilly areas to areas along rivers and lakes, as well as ethnic minority areas; their footprints can be found everywhere. It can be said that the vast rural areas of our country have entered a new era of vigorously developing industry.

    Such a leap in the development of rural industry marks that our country can develop social productive forces at an unprecedented high speed, creating conditions for gradually narrowing the gap between industry and agriculture, as well as the differences between cities and countryside in the future.

    A large number of examples in the exhibition show that the leap in the development of rural industry has played a significant role in supporting agricultural production and promoting the industrialization of people's communes. For example, after Gaotang County, Shandong Province, built 280 factories in 1958, it created many production tools, including 584,124 pieces of water lifting tools, various farm tools, and transportation tools alone, and created and improved 240 new products, thereby promoting the realization of "three-izations" in the county, namely, bearing-ization of rotating tools, vehicle-ization of transportation, and mechanization of rope traction, saving 2.829 million units of labor; crushing, sewing, ginning, and grain processing have been transformed from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization, greatly reducing labor intensity and improving labor conditions. These factories also produced a large amount of alcohol, vegetable oil, sugar, paper, and various hemp products (mainly ropes and sacks), which played a significant role in increasing social material wealth and improving the lives of commune members.

    Breaking the Mystical View of Running Industry

    The exhibition vividly tells people that the rapid development of rural industry in our country is mainly due to the thorough implementation of the Party's policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing indigenous and foreign methods, thoroughly breaking people's mystical view of running industry.

    In the past, when people mentioned running industry, they only thought of large factories, such as the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and Baotou Iron and Steel Corporation, but it was impossible to build many. As for running small-scale industries in rural areas, they looked down on it, thinking that these industries could not play any role in socialist construction. After implementing the policy of simultaneously developing large and small and medium-sized enterprises, people's minds were liberated, and a high tide of counties, townships, communes, and teams running industries in a big way, running more, and running them quickly was set off. Several pictures in the exhibition described the scene of the high tide: People's communes in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, built 181 factories of various sizes in just 40 days; People's communes in Yanjin County, Henan Province, worked hard for ten months and built and expanded 2,839 factories of various sizes....

    In the past, when people mentioned running industry, they simply relied on the central government to provide financial and material resources. As for running industry in a county or a commune, it was considered impossible. After implementing the policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, people saw the strength of their own county and township, and the strength of the masses, so they launched a vigorous mass movement and implemented the "five reliance" (relying on the masses for resources, relying on the masses for funds, relying on the masses for tools, equipment, and factory buildings, relying on the masses for technical strength, and relying on the masses for labor). As a result, all difficulties were readily solved, and a situation of thousands of horses galloping in the development of industry appeared everywhere.

    In the past, when people mentioned running industry, they only thought of "foreign methods." As for using "indigenous methods" to run industry, it was considered backward. After implementing the policy of simultaneously developing indigenous and foreign methods, people's understanding changed, and industry developed rapidly. The exhibition has many vivid examples to illustrate this point. For example, when Yanjin County, Henan Province, started running industry, some people blindly pursued "foreign methods," and as a result, the development of industry was very slow. They resolutely implemented "indigenous methods" and launched a large-scale "small indigenous groups" movement. In ten months, the county built more than 2,800 factories, effectively supporting agricultural production. Poverty-stricken, skillful, and starting from scratch broke the mystical view of running industry, and people's enthusiasm soared. In the Rural Industry Exhibition Hall, people can see many vivid examples of poverty-stricken, skillful, and starting from scratch. Everyone knows that making a lathe is not a simple task, but the bright and exquisite lathe on display here was made by hand. The manufacturer is Wang Yongfu, a member of the Baojiazhuang People's Commune in Suning County, Hebei Province. This 73-year-old hero, who repaired guns for the militia during the Anti-Japanese War, immediately participated in this work with great enthusiasm when he heard the commune discuss how to manufacture lathes to accelerate rural mechanization. In order to grind the two steel rails of the bed body into a shape that is high in the middle and low on both sides, they used a large sandstone weighing more than 300 kilograms, and four people carried it and ground it on the steel rail, but after grinding for four days, only a layer of rust was removed. Wang Yongfu knew that it would not work to work hard, so he took out a piece of high-speed steel from his home, made it into a planing tool, and planed it bit by bit, finally flattening the steel rail surface. They spent more than a month and created 33 kinds of special tools, creating more than 400 parts for the entire lathe. A brand-new lathe was finally born. Its precision meets the requirements of a general belt lathe. A picture introduces the bacterial fertilizer factory built by the Zhoukoudian Liangxiang People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing. In the exhibition line, there are also the iron-wood structure gantry planer of the Guyi Machinery Factory in Gucheng, Hebei Province, and the wooden bearing grinding machine in Tianjin, all of which were ingeniously made by workers using wood instead of steel.

    Vigorously Carry Out Technical Revolution

    Breaking the mystical view of running industry has also set off a high tide of vigorously carrying out technical revolution everywhere. In the center of the exhibition hall, the great creation of the people of Henan—indigenous steelmaking—is displayed: one is created by Shangcheng, Henan, called low-temperature steelmaking, and the furnace is made of yellow mud and sand; the other is improved by teachers and students of Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School based on the indigenous steelmaking methods in Weiyuan and other places in Sichuan, called indigenous reverberatory furnace steelmaking. These two furnaces produce more than one ton of low-carbon steel per day, and the quality meets the standards. Yingkou Gold Mine used to crush ore manually, which was very inefficient. Now, the exhibition introduces the wooden ore crusher manufactured by Han Yongfu, a carpenter, and Li Qingyuan, a fitter, etc., which can crush 129,000 kilograms of ore a day, replacing the operation of 260 people, and increasing efficiency by 13 times compared with manual labor. Its cost is only 370 yuan. This is a very meaningful technical innovation. At present, in the "small indigenous groups" ironmaking movement in our country, there are about 9 million people crushing ore manually. The birth of this crusher tells people that as long as they boldly reform tools, they can completely change the current manual crushing situation and liberate a large number of laborers. In the building materials exhibition section, the most eye-catching is the no-kiln rapid brick burning method created by Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. Its characteristic is that it does not build a kiln when building a factory (that is, digging holes underground to build adobe), saving investment. The production efficiency is 80% higher than that of horseshoe kilns and doubles that of tunnel kilns. This brick burning method can be used in high mountains, depressions, and plains. There are also many technical innovations in the light industry exhibition section.

    农村工业飞跃发展
    不久以前，我国农村工业还是寥寥无几。人们谈起了它，无非是一些米厂、面厂、粉坊、酒坊、豆腐坊等而已。现在我国农村工业正在飞跃地发展着。根据1958年1月至9月的不完全统计，我国县乡建设的工矿企业达六百六十八万个（10月份全国实现人民公社化以后，更远远超过这个数字），其中包括冶金工业、机械工业、煤炭工业、石油工业、建筑材料工业、纺织工业、米粮加工工业、日用品轻工业、食品工业等轻重工业。这些工业分布的范围很广，从平原到山区、从丘陵地区到沿江滨湖地区以及少数民族地区，都有它们的足迹。可以说我国广大农村已经进入大办工业的新时期。
    农村工业这样飞跃的发展，标志着我国能够以史无前例的高速度发展社会生产力，为将来逐步缩小工业同农业之间的差别以及城市和农村之间的区别创造了条件。
    展览会大量的事例表明，农村工业的飞跃发展，对于支援农业生产和促进人民公社工业化发挥了很大作用。例如，山东高唐县1958年兴建了二百八十处工厂后，创制了许多生产工具，其中仅提水工具、各种农具、运输工具等就达五十八万四千一百二十四件，创制和改制的新产品就有二百四十种，从而推动全县实现了“三化”，即运转工具轴承化，运输车子化，绳索牵引机化，节省劳力达二百八十二万九千个；碎粉、缝纫、轧花、粮食加工等，已由手工操作变为半机械化和机械化，大大减轻了劳动强度，改善了劳动条件。这些厂子还生产了大量的酒精、植物油、糖、纸以及各种麻制品（主要是绳和麻袋），这对于增加社会物质财富和改善社员生活起了很大作用。
    打破办工业的神秘观点
    展览会生动地告诉人们，我国农村工业能够这样飞跃的发展，主要是各地贯彻执行党所规定的中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举以及土法生产和洋法生产同时并举的方针，彻底打破了人们对于办工业的神秘观点。
    过去人们提起办工业，心目中只有大厂子，例如建设武汉钢铁公司、包头钢铁公司等，但不可能多办。至于在农村办小型工业那是瞧不起的，认为这些工业在社会主义建设中起不了什么作用。实行大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针之后，人们的思想解放了，掀起了县县、乡乡、社社、队队大办、多办、快办工业的高潮。展出的几幅图片这样描写了高潮的情景：山东省高唐县人民公社在短短四十天之内，就建成了大小工厂一百八十一个；河南省延津县人民公社大干了十个月，就新建、扩建了大小工厂二千八百三十九个……。
    过去人们提起办工业，就是单纯依靠中央拿出财力、物力来办，至于在一个县、一个社办工业，认为是不可能的。实行中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针之后，人们看到本县本乡的力量，群众的力量，因而大搞群众运动，实行了“五依靠”（资源依靠群众，资金依靠群众，工具设备厂房依靠群众，技术力量依靠群众，劳动力依靠群众）。结果，一切困难迎刃而解，各地出现了万马奔腾的大办工业的形势。
    过去，人们提起办工业，心目中只有“洋办法”，至于采用“土办法”办工业，认为是落后的。实行土法生产和洋法生产同时并举的方针之后，人们的认识改变了，工业迅速发展起来。展览会有许多生动事例说明了这个问题。比如，河南省延津县开始办工业，有一部分人一味追求“洋办法”，结果工业的发展很缓慢。坚决贯彻“土法上马”，大搞“小土群”运动，十个月全县就建成二千八百多个厂子，有力地支援了农业生产。穷干、巧干、白手起家打破了办工业的神秘观点，人们的干劲冲天。在农村工业展览馆，人们可以看到许多穷干、巧干、白手起家的生动事例。谁都知道，做旋床不是一件简单的事情，但是这里展出一部明亮精致的旋床，却是用手工造的。制造者是河北省肃宁县保家庄人民公社社员王永福，这个七十三岁的在抗日战争期间曾经为民兵修造过枪支的老英雄，当听到社里讨论如何制造旋床加速农村机械化的时候，他立即以火热的心情参加了这项工作。为了把床身的两条钢轨磨成当中高两边低，他们用一块三百多斤的大砂石、四个人抬着在钢轨上面磨，可是磨了四天，只磨了一层铁锈。王永福知道硬干不行，就从家里找出一块锋钢，打成抢刀，一点一点的抢，终于把钢轨面抢平。他们前后花了一个多月工夫，创造了三十三种特制的工具，造出了整个旋床的四百多个部件，一部崭新的旋床终于诞生了。它的精密度达到一般皮带旋床的要求。有一张图片介绍了北京市郊区周口店良乡人民公社建设的细菌肥料厂。在展出的行列里，还有河北省故城五一机械厂铁木结构的龙门刨和天津的木制轴承磨床等，都是工人们独出心裁地用木料代替钢铁制成的。
    大搞技术革命
    打破了办工业的神秘观点，也使各地掀起了大搞技术革命的高潮。在展览馆中央展出了河南人民的伟大创造——土法炼钢：一种是河南商城创造的，叫低温炼钢法，炉子是黄泥和砂子做的；一种是郑州农业机械化学校师生们根据四川威远等地的土法炼钢改进的，叫土法反射炉炼钢。这两种炉子日产低炭钢各在一吨以上，质量都合乎标准。营口市金矿以前用手工破碎矿石，效率非常低。现在展览会介绍该矿木工韩永福和钳工李庆元等制造的木制矿石破碎机，一天可以破碎矿石十二万九千斤，代替了二百六十个人的操作，比人工提高效率十三倍。它的造价只有三百七十元。这是一个很有意义的技术革新。目前我国在“小土群”的炼铁运动中，大约有九百万人在用手工破碎矿石。这部破碎机的诞生，告诉人们，只要大胆改革工具，完全可以改变目前手工破碎的局面，把大批劳动力解放出来。在建筑材料展出部分，最令人注目的是黑龙江省肇源县创造的无窑快速烧砖法。它的特点是，建厂不建窑（即在地下挖洞垒土坯），节省了投资，生产效率比马蹄窑提高80％，比串窑提高一倍，无论高山、洼地、平川都可以采用这种烧砖法。在轻工业展出部分也有许多技术革新。
