When it comes to railway construction, people often think first of how many new railways are being built, and wanting places that have never heard a train whistle to hear it for the first time. This kind of thinking is completely understandable. It reflects people's strong desire to spread railways throughout China. Building new railways is indeed an important part of railway construction. Our socialist construction cannot be confined to one area due to limitations in transportation conditions. It requires mobilizing resources from all regions of the country and rationally deploying productive forces nationwide, which requires continuous expansion of the railway network. If we do not seize the opportunity to build new railways and extend them to places that have never had them before, we will not be able to meet the ever-growing demands of socialist construction.

However, railway construction is not limited to building new lines. In recent years, especially since last year's comprehensive leap forward with steel as the key link, the situation of rapid development in the national economy has proven that while building new railways is important, the fastest growth in freight volume is on existing railways, especially some existing trunk lines. Transforming these lines and increasing their throughput capacity has become a matter of urgency. Not to mention the distant past, just looking at the situation in the past four months, although the railway departments have tried every means to tap the potential of existing railways, increasing the daily loading from 27,000 cars to 32,000 cars, it still cannot meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy. This is partly due to the limitation of insufficient vehicles, and partly due to the limitation of insufficient line throughput capacity. The average freight volume per kilometer of railways in our country has reached a very high level of load; especially some important railway trunk lines, the freight volume has long exceeded the limit of line throughput capacity. If we do not strengthen the transformation of existing railways, especially existing railway trunk lines, and quickly improve the throughput capacity of these lines, and prioritize the transformation of existing railways as the current focus of railway construction, we will not be able to undertake the ever-increasing transportation tasks.

Our country has more than 30,000 kilometers of existing railways. Some of them were built after liberation, such as the Baolan, Baocheng, Chengyu, Yingxia, and Laimu lines. The technical condition of these railways is generally better. Another part of the railways were left over from before liberation, such as the Jingguang, Jin-Hu, Jingshan, and Longhai lines. These railways were mostly of poor quality, with complex standards, and low efficiency in the past. Often, different weights of steel rails were laid on one railway line, and the curves, gradients, bridge load capacity, ballast thickness, etc., did not meet technical standards, resulting in very slow train speeds and small throughput capacity. Taking the famous Jingguang Railway as an example, before liberation, some sections of the Jingguang Railway could only travel at 15 to 30 kilometers per hour, and each train could only tow 700 to 800 tons of weight. After liberation, especially after 1954, the railway departments carried out large-scale transformation of these railways, replacing almost all the main trunk lines with heavy steel rails of 43 kilograms or more, and also made many improvements to the technical condition of the lines. Double tracks were built on some lines, and marshalling stations were added and expanded, and automatic block equipment was installed, which greatly improved the throughput capacity of these railways. On many sections of the Jingguang Railway, trains can now travel at 70 to 90 kilometers per hour, and each train can tow 2,700 to 2,800 tons of weight. However, because these railways are distributed in the more economically developed areas of North China, Central China, East China, and Northeast China, and connect major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenyang, and many of the key factories and mines invested by the state during the First Five-Year Plan are distributed near these railway trunk lines, these areas are densely populated and rich in agricultural products, so the freight volume of these railways has increased particularly rapidly. Although the transformation in recent years has greatly improved the throughput capacity of these railways, the distance between the transportation capacity and the amount of transportation required is still very large.

It should also be pointed out that with the development of new railways and the expansion of the railway network, the freight volume of existing railways will continue to grow. Except for some new railways parallel to existing railways, which can share some of the freight volume of existing railways, such as the railway from Jining to Erlian, which shares some of the freight volume of the railway from Manzhouli to Harbin, the construction of other new lines has mostly increased the freight volume of the original railways. Even the Jier Railway, although it shares part of the freight volume of the Binzhou Railway, it also increases the freight volume of the Jingbao Railway. "A thousand rivers flow into the sea," and every new railway must be directly or indirectly connected to the original railway to send a large number of goods to the original railway, requiring the existing railway to transport more materials. Every kilometer extension of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway increases the freight volume of the Longhai Railway; the construction of the Yingxia Railway, Laimu Railway, and Qian-Gui Railway has increased the burden on the Jingguang Railway. From this, it can be seen that building new railways is important and should be grasped tightly; but transforming existing railways is even more urgent. The more tightly new railways are grasped, and the more new railways are connected to existing railways, the more the transformation of existing railways should be strengthened. Therefore, the focus of current railway construction should first be placed on the transformation of existing railways. Only when the throughput capacity of existing railways is enhanced can it meet the requirements of national economic development, and can the transportation capacity of new railways be fully utilized. If the transformation of existing railways is not grasped tightly, and the existing railways become increasingly narrow and cramped (for the rapidly growing freight volume), it will be impossible to meet the needs of national economic development. Even if new railways have strong transportation capacity, they will be limited by the throughput capacity of existing railways, and cannot fully play their role.

Placing the focus of railway construction on the transformation of existing railways means that the construction of some new lines will have to be postponed for a while. Of course, this will not please the cadres and masses along the planned new lines. They always want the new lines to be built sooner and faster. This is completely understandable. But these comrades should understand that the postponement of the construction of some new lines is mainly due to the supply of steel rails not meeting the demand. The state can only produce a certain amount of steel rails in a year. From the perspective of national interests, it can only first meet the needs of the transformation of existing trunk lines. When the existing trunk lines are transformed and more steel rails are produced, the postponed new lines can be built faster. Local interests should be subordinate to overall interests. This is something that everyone should understand. Moreover, placing the focus of current railway construction on the transformation of existing railways does not mean that the construction of new lines is postponed altogether. The construction of new railway trunk lines in the Northwest, Southwest and other places will still be stepped up this year. Even if the construction of new lines in some places is postponed for a while, it will not hinder the localities from giving play to their initiative. The localities can completely start with the earthwork and stonework of the roadbed. Once there are steel rails, they can immediately lay the tracks and open to traffic; they can also first lay ductile iron rails, cast steel rails or pig iron rails, and use small steam locomotives, cars, and tractors to tow and open to traffic, and then replace them with steel rails when they are available.

Transforming existing railways includes repairing lines, increasing marshalling stations, and adopting new technical equipment, etc. We should transform existing railways according to the principle of prioritizing urgent needs and combining indigenous and foreign methods. The lines and sections with the heaviest traffic should be transformed first; the lines and sections with less traffic can be slowed down temporarily. The latest technological achievements such as automated control equipment should be adopted; indigenous methods such as "native hump marshalling yards," high platforms, and low freight positions should also be adopted. The main equipment essential for train operation should be complete and thorough; auxiliary equipment can be slightly worse, and gradually improved according to transportation needs. At present, we should pay special attention to the double-track projects of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu railways. These two railways are the two major arteries running through the north and south of our country, and are the lines with the most strained transportation. Repairing the double tracks of these two railways will greatly help to alleviate the strained situation of railway transportation.

In order to accelerate the transformation of existing railways, we must implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people building railways. If we only rely on the railway departments to build railways, no matter how fast the speed is, we can only advance step by step; if we mobilize the whole party and the whole people to build railways, we can start construction on the whole line and greatly accelerate the speed. In the double-track projects of the Jingguang and Jin-Hu railways, thanks to the mobilization of more than one million people in the eight provinces and cities along the line, the earthwork and stonework of the roadbed, which used to take two or three years to complete, was completed in just a few months, creating an unprecedented record, proving that the policy of the whole party and the whole people building railways has unparalleled power. Only by implementing the policy of the whole party and the whole people building railways, and combining the strength of the railway departments with the strength of the whole people, can railway construction truly achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, and better integrate railway construction with local economic construction. In mobilizing the masses to build the Jingguang double track, Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province combined the double track project to turn earthen pits into ponds, and grass ditches into rice paddies, storing 220,000 cubic meters of water and expanding the cultivated area by more than 1,000 mu, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. Recently, the Ministry of Railways has already held an on-site conference on the whole party and the whole people running railways in Zhengzhou, introducing the experience of Henan and other places in the whole party and the whole people repairing the Jingguang and Jin-Hu double-track projects. When transforming existing railways, we must fully use these experiences to accelerate the transformation of existing railways.

A greater leap forward in the national economy in 1959 has begun! With thousands of troops and horses on the battlefield, existing railways bear the brunt. We must concentrate our efforts to accelerate the transformation of existing railways, widen the roads, and let the galloping horses of the great leap forward in the national economy rush forward!

### 改造现有铁路是当前铁路建设的重点

    改造现有铁路是当前铁路建设的重点
    谈到铁路建设，人们首先想到的，往往是新建多少铁路，要使哪些过去没有铁路的地方第一次响起火车头鸣叫的声音。这种想法是完全可以理解的。它反映了人们对于把铁路铺遍全中国的强烈的愿望。新建铁路也确实是铁路建设中一个重要的组成部分。我国的社会主义建设不能受制于交通条件局限一隅；它要求调动全国各个地区的资源，要求在全国范围内合理地部署生产力，这就需要不断地扩大铁路网。如果我们不抓紧新建铁路，把铁路伸展到过去没有铁路的地方去，就不能适应社会主义建设日益发展的要求。
    然而，铁路建设却不只限于新线建设。几年来，特别是去年以钢为纲，全面跃进以来，国民经济大发展的形势，证明了新建铁路固然重要，但运量增长最快的，还是现有铁路，特别是现有的一些铁路干线；改造这些线路，提高这些线路的通过能力，已成当务之急。远的不提，就拿过去四个月的情况来看，铁路部门虽然千方百计地挖掘现有铁路的潜力，从每天装二万七千车增加到装三万二千车，还是不能满足国民经济各方面的要求。这一方面固然是受到车辆不足的限制；另一方面也是受到线路通过能力不足的限制。我国铁路平均每公里担负的运量已经达到很高的负荷水平；特别是一些重要的铁路干线，运量早已超过线路通过能力的限度。如果我们不加强对现有铁路、特别是现有铁路干线的改造，迅速提高这些线路的通过能力，把改造现有铁路列为当前铁路建设的重点，就不能担负起与日俱增的运输任务。
    我国现有三万多公里铁路。其中一部分是解放后新建的，如宝兰、宝成、成渝、鹰厦、来睦等线。这些铁路的技术状况一般是比较好的。另一部分铁路是解放前遗留下来的，如京广、津沪、京山、陇海等线。这些铁路过去大都质量很差，标准很复杂，效率很低。常常在一条铁路上铺设着轻重不同的钢轨，线路的弯道、坡度、桥梁载重能力、道碴的厚度等等，都不符合技术标准，因而行车速度很慢，通过能力很小。拿著名的京广铁路来说，解放前，京广铁路的有些区段，火车每小时只能行走十五公里到三十公里，每列火车只能牵引七、八百吨的重量。解放后，特别是1954年以后，铁路部门对这些铁路进行了大规模的改造，差不多在主要干线上全部换用了四十三公斤以上的重型钢轨，对线路的技术状况也进行了多方面的改善，并且在部分线路上修建了复线，增加和扩大了编组站，装置了自动闭塞设备，大大提高了这些铁路的通过能力。京广铁路上的许多地段，火车每小时已能行走七十公里至九十公里，每列火车已能牵引二千七、八百吨的重量。但是，由于这些铁路分布在华北、华中、华东、东北等经济比较发达的地区，连结着北京、天津、上海、武汉、沈阳等大城市，第一个五年计划期间国家投资的重点工厂和矿山有许多分布在这些铁路干线的附近，这些地区人口稠密，农产品丰富，因此这些铁路的运量就增长得特别快；尽管几年来的改造已经大大提高了这些铁路的通过能力，但运输能力同需要运输的数量之间的距离仍然很大。
    还应该指出的是，随着新建铁路的发展，随着铁路网的扩大，现有铁路的运量还会继续增长。除了一些同现有铁路平行的新建铁路，能够分担一些现有铁路的运量，例如集宁至二连的铁路分担了一些满洲里至哈尔滨的铁路的运量之外，其他新线的建设，大都加重了原有铁路的运量；即便是集二铁路，它虽然分担了一部分滨洲铁路的运量，同时也加重了京包铁路的运量。“千条河流归大海”，每一条新建铁路都要直接或间接同原有铁路连结起来，把大批货物送到原有铁路上来，要求现有铁路运出更多的物资。兰新铁路的每一公里延长，都增加了陇海铁路的运量；鹰厦铁路、来睦铁路、黔桂铁路的建设，都加重了京广铁路的负担。由此可见，新建铁路固然是重要的，应该抓紧；但改造现有铁路更是刻不容缓的事情。新建铁路愈是抓紧，愈是有更多的新建铁路同现有铁路连结起来，就愈要加强对现有铁路的改造。因此，当前铁路建设的重点应该首先摆在现有铁路的改造上。本固支荣，只有现有铁路的通过能力增强了，才能满足国民经济发展的要求，也才能把新建铁路的运输力量充分发挥出来。如果不抓紧对现有铁路的改造，让现有铁路日益成为狭窄的羊肠小道（对迅速增长的货运量来说），就无法满足国民经济发展的需要，新建铁路纵有强大的运输力量，也受到现有铁路通过能力的限制，而不能充分发挥作用。
    把铁路建设的重点摆在现有铁路的改造上，有些新线的建设就只好推迟一些时候。这对于这些计划中的新线的沿线的干部和群众说来，当然会不乐意。他们总想新线早些、快些建设起来好。这是完全可以理解的。但是这些同志应当了解，某些新线建设的推迟，主要是由于钢轨供不应求。国家一年只能生产一定数量的钢轨，从全国利益来看，只能首先满足现有干线改造的需要。现有干线改造好了，钢轨生产多了，推迟了的新线就可以更快地建设起来。局部利益应该服从整体利益。这是大家都应该明白的。况且，当前铁路建设的重点摆在现有铁路的改造上，并不意味着新线建设一概推迟了。西北、西南等地新的铁路干线的建设，今年也还是要加紧进行的。即便有些地方的新线建设被推迟一些时候，也不妨碍地方上发挥自己的积极性。地方上完全可以先把路基土石方工程做起来，一旦有了钢轨，立即铺轨通车；也可以先铺设球墨铸铁铁轨，铸钢钢轨或生铁铁轨，用小型的蒸汽机车、汽车、拖拉机牵引，通起车来，等有了钢轨，再行更换。
    改造现有铁路，包括修复线，增加编组站、采用新的技术装备等等。我们应当根据轻重缓急，实行土洋并举的方针，分别对现有铁路进行改造。运输最繁忙的线路、区段应该首先进行改造；运输还不很紧张的线路、区段可以暂时缓一缓。自动化的控制设备等最新的技术成就应该采用；“土驼峰调车场”、高站台、低货位等土办法也应该采用。行车必不可少的主要设备应该齐全、周到；辅助设备可以稍差一些，视运输需要再来逐步改进。目前，应该特别抓紧京广、津沪这两条铁路的复线工程。这两条铁路是我国贯穿南北的两条大动脉，是运输最紧张的线路。把这两条铁路的复线修好，对缓和铁路运输的紧张状况将有很大作用。
    为了加快对现有铁路的改造，必须贯彻全党全民修铁路的方针。如果仅仅依靠铁路部门来修铁路，速度再快，也只能节节前进；如果发动全党全民修铁路，就能全线动工，大大加快速度。京广和津沪两条铁路的复线工程中，由于动员了沿线八个省市一百多万人力，在短短的几个月中就完成了过去要用两三年才能完成的路基土石方工程，创造了空前的纪录，证明了全党全民办铁路的方针具有无比的威力。只有贯彻全党全民修铁路的方针，把铁路部门的力量和全民的力量结合起来，才能使铁路建设真正做到多快好省，并且使铁路的建设同当地的经济建设更好地结合起来。河南许昌专区在发动群众修建京广复线中，就结合复线工程，变土坑为水塘，变草沟为稻田，蓄水二十二万立方，扩大耕地面积一千多亩，收一举数得之效。最近，铁道部已经在郑州召开了全党全民办铁路的现场会议，介绍了河南等地全党全民修京广、津沪复线工程的经验。我们在改造现有铁路时，要充分运用这些经验，来加快现有铁路的改造。
    1959年国民经济更大的跃进已经开始了！千军万马上阵，现有铁路首当其冲。我们一定要集中力量加快对现有铁路的改造，拓宽道路，让国民经济大跃进的骏马直奔向前！
