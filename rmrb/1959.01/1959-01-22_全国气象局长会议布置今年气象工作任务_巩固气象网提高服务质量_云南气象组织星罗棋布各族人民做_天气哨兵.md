Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 21st. The National Meteorological Bureau Chiefs' Meeting was held in Chengdu from the 11th to the 19th. The meeting summarized the main achievements and basic experiences of meteorological work over the past year and focused on deploying this year's tasks.

The meeting held that in the past year, due to the combination of professional meteorological organs and mass meteorological work, and the leadership and development of meteorological work using mass movement methods, meteorological work has taken on a new look. A densely distributed meteorological service network has been formed throughout the country; supplementary forecasting has been promoted. The service network is established by meteorological observatories, stations, outposts, and various weather-watching groups according to administrative regions, production unit needs, and a certain density. The basic completion of the meteorological service network has enabled meteorological work to take root among the masses. Supplementary forecasting is the combination of modern meteorological science and the rich meteorological experience of the working people. Based on the large-scale weather forecasts issued by meteorological observatories, stations, outposts, and groups supplement them layer by layer, correct them level by level, and make up for the shortcomings of inaccurate forecasts due to local weather changes and the influence of terrain and geographical conditions on the weather. According to statistics, the accuracy of weather forecasts after supplementary corrections has increased by an average of more than 10%. Weather forecasts have played a significant role in coordinating production and construction, especially agricultural production. For example, during the autumn harvest season last year, 37 counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province, due to forecasting wind, rain, frost, and other weather conditions, organized early harvesting and recovered more than 170 million catties of grain and more than 1.11 billion catties of vegetables. Meteorological work has received the attention and support of party committees at all levels and the broad masses. At the same time, superstitions have been broken among the masses, and the belief that man can conquer nature has been established.

Based on the basic experience gained in meteorological work last year, the main task for 1959 determined by the meeting is to consolidate the meteorological service network, improve service quality, vigorously carry out agricultural meteorological forecasting work, and serve as the "vanguard" of agricultural production. All observatories, stations, and outposts across the country must carry out supplementary forecasting and continuously improve forecast accuracy. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out publicity work so that people across the country can understand forecasts and use them. In addition, we must actively carry out experimental research on artificial control of local weather; rectify and strengthen civil aviation meteorological work; and strengthen the construction of the marine hydrological and meteorological station network.

More than 100 people, including the directors of meteorological bureaus of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as office directors, attended the meeting. The directors of the meteorological bureaus of Henan Province, Yunnan Province, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region made typical speeches at the meeting.

This newspaper reports that more than 100,000 people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province have joined the ranks of meteorological sentinels.

Since Yunnan has implemented the policy of "the whole party and the whole people running the meteorological undertaking," under the leadership of party committees at all levels, scientific workers and the broad masses of farmers have combined, adopted the methods of running schools and taking apprentices, trained a large number of young peasant technicians with a junior high school education level, and solved the difficulty of lacking technical cadres in the construction of the meteorological network. Up to now, nearly 200 agricultural meteorological stations and climate stations have been established in the province, 1,400 meteorological outposts have been set up with people's communes as units, and various places have absorbed a large number of farmers with rich meteorological practical knowledge and weather-watching experience, forming 25,000 "weather-watching groups." Now, a densely distributed meteorological service network has been established throughout the province, achieving "observatories in special and prefectural areas, stations in every county, outposts in every township, and weather-watching groups everywhere," basically realizing meteorologization.

In the process of the mass movement to run meteorological undertakings, due to the adoption of indigenous and modern methods in various places, the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly stimulated, creating many miracles for serving agricultural production. In the past, some meteorological experts always believed that weather forecasts could only be made by meteorological observatories and senior technicians. Before last year, some comrades from meteorological stations in Yunnan Province were also bound by these "theories" and dared not carry out forecasting work. Tan Wenguang and Zhu Zijian, observers at the Zhenxiong County Climate Station, used simple instruments and equipment to create a new national record of single-station supplementary forecasting last summer. After holding on-site meetings and exchanging experiences, all meteorological stations and climate stations in the province have now started single-station supplementary forecasting, and more than 100 stations have also started medium- and long-term weather forecasting. Zhou Shuchen, a young Naxi from Lijiang Meteorological Station, diligently studied hard on the basis of his original junior high school education level. Not only did he learn high-altitude operations, but he also created the miracle of balloons rising to a height of 4,702 kilometers by using hot water to soak the balloons to increase the elasticity of the balloon skin. The weather-watching groups in Yuxi County used black, white, and red flags and the number of flags to indicate rainy, cloudy, and sunny weather conditions, predicting weather changes in fields or mountains; the weather-watching groups in Heqing County of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture can also predict hail.

Since the meteorological organizations in various places have adopted a method of combining theory and practice to carry out forecasting work, the general forecasts are very accurate. The meteorological stations or climate stations listened to the regional climate forecasts of the meteorological observatories and summarized local experiences, collected relevant weather change ballads, combined with personally observed local weather conditions and the forecasts of meteorological outposts and weather-watching groups to carry out forecasting work. The average accuracy rate reached more than 85%, and even as high as more than 95% in Yao'an, Binchuan, and Daguan counties.

Meteorological organizations in various places played a significant role in drought resistance, flood prevention, autumn harvesting, and autumn planting last year. The Xiaoguangnan weather-watching group in Guangnan County, through weather forecasts, enabled the entire community to harvest more than 100,000 catties of millet in a timely manner. Now, according to the data accumulated by meteorological organizations in various places, after analysis, the Yunnan Provincial Agricultural Meteorological Regional Map and the regional maps of various crops have been drawn, creating conditions for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    全国气象局长会议布置今年气象工作任务
    巩固气象网提高服务质量
    云南气象组织星罗棋布各族人民做“天气哨兵”
    新华社成都21日电　全国气象局长会议11日到19日在成都举行。会议总结了去年一年来气象工作的主要成绩和基本经验，重点地布置了今年的任务。
    会议认为，去年一年来，由于专业的气象机关与群众性的气象工作相结合，用群众运动的方法来领导和发展气象工作，使气象事业出现了新的面貌。全国已经组成了星罗棋布的气象服务网；推广了补充预报。服务网是以气象台、站、哨和各个看天小组按行政区域、生产单位需要和一定的密度建立而成的。气象服务网的基本建成，使气象工作在群众中扎了根。补充预报是现代气象科学与劳动人民丰富的气象经验的结合，在气象台发布的大范围气象预报的基础上，通过站、哨、组，层层补充，级级订正，弥补了由于地方性天气变化和地形地理条件对天气影响而使预报不准的缺陷。据统计，经过补充订正以后的天气预报，准确率平均提高了10％以上。天气预报在配合生产建设，特别是农业生产方面起了显著的作用。如去年秋收时期，黑龙江省有三十七个县、市，由于预告了风、雨、霜等天气情况，及早组织抢收，收回了粮食一亿七千多万斤，蔬菜十一亿一千多万斤。气象工作受到了各级党委和广大群众的重视与支持。同时，在群众中还破除了迷信，树立了人定胜天的信念。
    会议根据去年气象工作中取得的基本经验，确定1959年主要任务是巩固气象服务网，提高服务质量，大力开展农业气象预报工作，当好农业生产的“尖兵”。全国所有的台、站、哨都要开展补充预报，不断提高预报准确率。与此同时，还要大力开展宣传工作，使全国人民都能懂得预报，会用预报。另外，还要积极开展人工控制局部天气的试验研究；整顿和加强民航气象工作；加强海洋水文气象台站网的建设。
    参加这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区的气象局长，以及办公室主任等共一百多人。河南省、云南省和广西僮族自治区的气象局长在会上作了典型发言。
    本报讯　云南省十万多各族人民参加了气象哨兵的队伍。
    云南各地贯彻“全党全民办气象事业”的方针以来，在各级党委领导下，科学工作人员与广大农民群众结合，采取办学校和带徒弟的方法，训练培养了大批具有高小文化水平的青年农民技术员，解决建设气象网工作中缺乏技术干部的困难。到目前为止，全省已建立近二百个农业气象站和气候站，以人民公社为单位设立了一千四百个气象哨，各地并吸收广大富有气象实践知识和看天经验的农民，组成了二万五千个“看天小组”。现在，全省已建成了星罗棋布的气象服务网，做到“专、州有台，县县有站，乡乡有哨，处处有看天小组”，基本实现了气象化。
    在群众性大办气象事业的过程中，由于各地采取土、洋结合的办法，大大激发了群众的积极性，为农业生产服务创造了许多奇迹。过去，有些气象专家一直认为天气预报只有气象台和高级技术人员才能作。云南省各气象站的一些同志在去年以前，也为这些“理论”所束缚，不敢开展预报工作。镇雄县气候站观测员谭文光和朱子健，利用简陋的仪器设备，在去年夏天首创了单站补充预报的全国新纪录。经过召开现场会议和交流经验，全省各个气象站、气候站现在都已纷纷开展单站补充预报，同时有一百多个站还开展了中长期天气预报。丽江气象站的纳西族青年周曙辰，在原有高小文化程度的基础上勤学苦练，不仅学会了高空业务，还采用热水浸泡气球以增加球皮弹力的办法，创造气球放高四千七百零二公里的奇迹。玉溪县的看天小组用黑、白、红三色旗帜及旗的数量表示下雨、阴、晴天气状况，在田坝或山上预报天气的变化；大理白族自治州鹤庆县的看天小组还能预测冰雹。
    由于各地气象组织采取了理论与实践相结合的方法进行预报工作，因此一般预报都很准确。各气象站或气候站一方面收听气象台地区气候预报，一方面总结当地经验、收集有关天气变化的歌谚，结合亲自观测的当地天气情况和气象哨、看天小组的预报进行预报工作，平均准确率达到85％以上，其中姚安、宾川、大关等县甚至高达95％以上。
    各地气象组织，在去年抗旱防洪和秋收秋种中起了很大的作用。广南县的小广南看天小组，通过天气预报，使全社及时抢收了十多万斤谷子。现在，根据各地气象组织积累的资料，经过分析已绘制出云南全省农业气象区域图和各种作物的区域图，为今年农业生产更大的跃进创造了条件。（陈铮）
