Everyone Mobilizes to Accumulate Rice Seedling Ash

(Reported by this newspaper) Liyang County, Jiangsu Province plans to plant 600,000 mu of rice this year, requiring about 200,000 mu of seedling fields. If each mu of seedling field requires ten dan of rice seedling ash, then two million dan of rice seedling ash needs to be stored. To meet the needs of spring planting, the communes in this county have formulated measures and action plans to complete the storage of rice seedling ash. The water conservancy project headquarters has also put forward requirements to the commanders of various construction sites. The Madian Commune, in conjunction with the implementation of the "four guarantees" (guaranteeing grain, vegetables, money, and grass) work in the canteens, assigned the task of storing rice seedling ash to the canteens. Each canteen also established a professional organization for collecting and storing rice seedling ash, specifically responsible for the storage and management of rice seedling ash. At the same time, commune members were also educated to send the rice straw ash from their temporary cooking and hot water heating at home to centralized rice seedling ash storage locations.

To prevent the loss of rice seedling ash, each production team also vacated empty rooms to pile up the rice seedling ash. In addition to using the canteens as a base to assign tasks to the canteens, the Dongfeng People's Commune also assigned ash storage tasks to units that burn rice straw ash and bran ash, such as bathhouses, boiled water shops, livestock farms, and schools.

    大家动手积储秧灰
    本报讯　江苏溧阳县今年计划种水稻六十万亩，需做秧田二十万亩左右。如以每亩秧田撒秧灰十担计，就需储存秧灰二百万担。这个县各公社为了适应春播的需要，订出完成秧灰储存的措施和行动规划。水利工程指挥部也向各工地指挥员提出了要求。马垫公社结合食堂“四包”（包粮、包菜、包钱、包草）工作的贯彻，把秧灰储存的任务定到食堂，各食堂并建立了秧灰搜集保管的专业组织，专门负责秧灰的储存与管理。同时还教育社员把家里临时烧饭和烧热水的稻草灰送到秧灰集中的地方储存起来。
    为了不使秧灰散失，各生产队并腾出了空房堆集秧灰。东风人民公社除了以食堂为基地把任务包到食堂以外，对浴室、开水店、畜牧场、学校等烧稻草灰和糠灰的单位都分配储灰的任务。
