Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 22nd: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement condemning the Syngman Rhee clique for recently selling Korean residents from the northern part of Korea and discharged soldiers from the Rhee army, who were abducted to South Korea by the United States and Syngman Rhee during the war, to Central and South American countries under the guise of "immigration."

The statement said: The "immigration" plot concocted by the Syngman Rhee clique under the manipulation of US imperialism is, in fact, a treasonous and anti-national act of selling Korean compatriots groaning in the dark life of South Korea to foreign capitalists and farm owners as slaves. This behavior has aroused national anger among all Korean people. The statement emphasized that the South Korean compatriots who are groaning in hunger and poverty must be rescued as soon as possible, and the Syngman Rhee clique's rebellious "immigration" behavior must be stopped immediately.

The statement, in condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's fallacy that this "immigration" is due to overpopulation in South Korea, said that it is very clear that the problem is not due to overpopulation, but due to the tragic situation of the American imperialism and Syngman Rhee clique splitting the motherland and the nation, causing the people to fall into poverty. The statement pointed out that as a result of the US and Syngman Rhee clique's policy of killing and plundering for fourteen years, South Korea's national industry and rural economy have been comprehensively bankrupt, and the lives of the working people are seriously threatened. More than 4.2 million unemployed and millions of starving farmers are wandering the streets in groups, and hundreds of thousands of wandering orphans are facing death. Hunger and poverty have swept across South Korea.

The statement said that the only way to free the South Korean people from today's intolerable misfortune and suffering is to drive out the US imperialist invading forces and peacefully unify the motherland by the Korean people themselves.

The statement said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has put forward a series of reasonable plans to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and is willing to take measures to help the unemployed and wandering orphans in South Korea. However, due to the opposition of the US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, these measures have not been realized.

The statement emphasized that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea cannot stand idly by in the face of this cruel act of the Syngman Rhee clique, and believes that it is its noble national duty to save compatriots who are trapped in misfortune. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demands that all the South Korean unemployed who will be forced to immigrate to foreign countries be transferred to the northern part of the Republic. The statement also strongly demanded that the United Nations forces quickly repatriate residents abducted from the northern part of the Republic during the war, in accordance with the armistice agreement. The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will accept all South Korean residents whom the Syngman Rhee clique attempts to force to move to foreign countries, and will guarantee to help them solve their employment, provide learning opportunities, and arrange their lives according to their abilities and wishes. The statement said that the northern part of the Republic has a solid economic foundation and is fully capable of doing all this.

The statement concluded by expressing its deep conviction that all kind people in the world will give corresponding support to this major measure of the Republic.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The Korean Embassy in China held a press conference this evening to announce the statement issued today by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the outrageous criminal conspiracy of the Syngman Rhee gang to sell South Korean poor people as slaves, and condemned this criminal act of the Syngman Rhee gang under the manipulation of US imperialism.

Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, read out the statement of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the press conference.

In response to questions from reporters, Ambassador Li Yong-ho said: We are very clear that everything that happens in South Korea is carried out under the instigation of the US imperialism, which occupies South Korea. US imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean people. Because US imperialism occupies South Korea, our motherland has not yet been unified, and the suffering and losses suffered by the Korean people as a result are immeasurable. He said: US imperialism must get out of our motherland's land as soon as possible, and all the crimes of betraying the nation and the motherland committed by the Syngman Rhee puppet gang under the instigation of the United States must be stopped immediately. The Korean people will continue to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and this just struggle will surely be victorious.

    朝鲜政府发表声明
    谴责美李集团出卖朝鲜人民
    朝鲜驻华大使馆举行记者招待会
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，谴责李承晚集团最近把在战争时期被美国和李承晚劫往南朝鲜的朝鲜北部居民和李伪军的退伍军人以“移民”的名义出卖给中、南美国家。
    声明说：李承晚集团在美帝国主义操纵下所策划的这个“移民”阴谋，事实上是把呻吟在南朝鲜黑暗生活中的朝鲜同胞出卖给外国资本家和农场主作奴隶的卖国的、背叛民族的行为。这种行为在全体朝鲜人民中激起了民族愤怒。声明强调说，必须尽早拯救呻吟在饥饿和贫困中的南朝鲜同胞，必须立即制止李承晚集团的叛逆性的“移民”行为。
    声明在谴责李承晚集团所说的这次“移民”是由于南朝鲜人口过剩的谬论时说，事情很明显，问题并不是由于人口过剩，而是由于美帝国主义和李承晚集团分裂祖国和民族，人民陷于贫困的悲惨处境的原故。声明指出，由于美国和李承晚集团十四年来实行杀人和掠夺政策的结果，南朝鲜民族工业和农村经济全面破产，劳动人民的生活受到严重威胁。四百二十多万失业者和数百万断粮农民成群地徬徨在街头，数十万流浪孤儿面临死亡，饥饿和贫困席卷了南朝鲜全境。
    声明说，使南朝鲜人民摆脱今天不可容忍的不幸和痛苦的唯一途径，是赶走美帝国主义侵略军队，由朝鲜人民自己和平统一祖国。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了实现祖国的和平统一，曾经提出了一系列的合理方案，并且愿意在救济南朝鲜失业者和流浪孤儿方面采取措施。但是，由于美帝国主义和李承晚集团的反对，这些措施未能实现。
    声明强调说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府决不能对李承晚集团这一残忍的行为袖手旁观，并且认为，拯救陷于不幸的祖国同胞，是自己的崇高的民族义务。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，要求把那些将被迫移居外国的南朝鲜失业者全部移交共和国北部。声明还强烈要求联合国军方面根据停战协定，迅速遣返战时从共和国北部劫走的居民。声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将全部接收李承晚集团企图强迫移到外国去的南朝鲜居民，并且保证根据他们的能力和希望，帮助解决职业，提供学习方便和安排生活。声明说，共和国北部有着巩固的经济基础，完全能做到这一切。
    声明最后表示深信，全世界一切善良的人们，对共和国这一重大措施，将给予相应的支持。
    新华社22日讯　朝鲜驻华大使馆今天晚间举行记者招待会，宣布朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天就李承晚匪帮把南朝鲜贫民当做奴隶出卖的令人发指的罪恶阴谋所发表的声明，并谴责了李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义操纵下的这一罪恶行为。
    朝鲜驻华大使李永镐在记者招待会上宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明。
    李永镐大使在回答记者的问题时说：我们很清楚，南朝鲜发生的一切，都是在强占着南朝鲜的美帝国主义的指使下进行的。美帝国主义是朝鲜人民不共戴天的死敌。由于美帝国主义强占南朝鲜，我们的祖国还没有得到统一，朝鲜人民因此而受到的痛苦和损失是不可估量的。他说：美帝国主义必须早日滚出我们祖国的土地，李承晚傀儡匪帮在美国指使下所犯的一切出卖民族、出卖祖国的罪行必须立即予以制止。朝鲜人民将继续为和平统一祖国而斗争，这一正义的斗争一定获得胜利。
