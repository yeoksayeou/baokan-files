Everyone Mobilizes to Vigorously Promote Fertilizer Accumulation Movement
Hebei Adopts a Combination of Chemical Fertilizer and Manure, Professional Teams and Masses

This newspaper reports: Hebei Province is making full use of the favorable conditions of the people's communes, combining professional teams with the masses, political education with appropriate rewards, local fertilizer with farm manure, and tapping potential with opening up new fertilizer sources, so that the first winter fertilizer accumulation upsurge after communization is rapidly developing.

Hebei is vigorously promoting natural manure accumulation, carrying out the "Five Cleans" (clean houses, courtyards, streets, threshing grounds, and under trees) campaign, and accumulating ash and urine. As of January 17, the province has accumulated over 790 billion jin of various kinds of rough fertilizer, an increase of over 350 billion jin compared with the same period last year, and 60% of the rough fertilizer accumulated this year is of better quality, such as pen manure and human waste. At the same time, various localities have also vigorously carried out the production of local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. The province has built over 47,000 local chemical fertilizer factories and bacterial fertilizer factories, and has produced over 12 billion jin of various local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers.

In carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement, Hebei has given full play to the collective strength of the people's communes, vigorously organized collective fertilizer accumulation and production, developed collective pig raising and fertilizer accumulation in communes, teams, and canteens, and established fertilizer accumulation professional teams to carry out shock work. All people's communes have established fertilizer accumulation professional teams. According to statistics from just over a dozen counties (cities), more than 20,000 fertilizer accumulation professional teams have been established, with over 500,000 members. The Baihugou Commune in Longhua County established 21 fertilizer accumulation professional teams, with a total of 3,792 laborers, who repaired 964 toilets, dug 1,115 urine pools, and picked up 755,000 jin of manure in three days. The 143-member burning fertilizer professional team of the Youyi Production Brigade in this county used 60 small indigenous iron smelting furnaces to burn 1.9 million jin of fertilizer. While organizing professional fertilizer accumulation and production teams, various localities also paid attention to carrying out mass fertilizer accumulation movements. At present, the number of people in the province involved in the fertilizer accumulation movement has reached more than 3.27 million, and in many places, everyone is involved and every household is accumulating fertilizer.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement, attention is paid to combining political education with material rewards, thus mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses for fertilizer accumulation. While vigorously carrying out socialist and communist education and organizing fertilizer accumulation competitions, many communes have formulated some appropriate reward methods based on local conditions and commune conditions. The main form of reward is quota-based fertilizer accumulation with excess rewards. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, production teams, professional teams, breeders, or households generally set fertilizer accumulation and production tasks based on fertilizer sources and labor conditions, after discussion by commune members, and appropriately give spiritual and material rewards for excess tasks. The communes in Zunhua County carried out red flag competitions, with 150 red flags circulating among the production units, and prizes were awarded every ten days to half a month. The fertilizer accumulated by commune members during their spare time and the excess fertilizer were priced according to quality and the commune gave material rewards. This made the 25,000-member fertilizer accumulation professional team in the county more solid, and the number of people accumulating fertilizer in their spare time also increased from 10,000 to more than 90,000.

In the winter fertilizer accumulation and production movement, Hebei Province continued to tap the potential of old fertilizer sources on the one hand, and on the other hand, made full use of the superiority of the people's communes to vigorously open up new fertilizer sources. Some people said that after two consecutive upsurges of fertilizer accumulation last spring, there were not many fertilizer sources, some pit mud had already been dug, and toilets had been moved once, so they could not be dug and moved again continuously. However, facts have proved that fertilizer sources have not been exhausted, and the methods created and promoted by various localities, such as warm circle fertilizer accumulation, high-temperature fertilizer accumulation, and cow-tail stove burning fertilizer, have greatly opened up fertilizer sources. Jiahe County first worked on ten key fertilizer accumulation areas, and then organized on-site visits. By visiting and calculating the fertilizer source accounts, the commune members' thinking was liberated and a total of more than 20 kinds of fertilizer sources were discovered. The Nandong Commune in Gaocheng County dug more than 800 high-temperature composting pits, and this one fertilizer production item solved 30% of the fertilizer needed by the commune. In terms of locally made chemical fertilizers, various localities have produced a total of more than 90 kinds, among which the fertilizers with higher fertilizer efficiency include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium mixed fertilizer, fire saltpeter fertilizer, brine fertilizer, and locally made urea. Many areas have also found peat underground.

In the fertilizer accumulation movement in Hebei, generally the secretaries are in charge and strengthen specific leadership. Under the specific leadership of the CPC Handan Prefectural Committee, this special zone has launched a shock month movement for fertilizer accumulation since January 7. One to three county party secretaries in each county under its jurisdiction personally grasp this movement. In Zunhua County, Tangshan Special Zone, due to the personal leadership of the county party secretary, more than 3,200 cadres in the county carried manure baskets and engaged in fertilizer accumulation movement with the masses, which vigorously promoted the fertilizer accumulation work. At the same time, many areas have also run training classes for local chemical fertilizer technicians at the commune level, generally requiring that each production team have more than five people who can master the technology of making local chemical fertilizers, in order to produce more and improve the quality of local chemical fertilizers.

    人人动手大搞积肥运动
    河北采取化肥和家肥、专业队和群众等四结合办法
    本报讯　河北省充分利用人民公社化的有利条件，以专业队与群众相结合、政治教育与适当奖励相结合、土化肥与农家肥相结合，挖潜力与开辟新肥源相结合的办法，使公社化以后的第一次冬季积肥高潮迅速的开展起来。
    河北各地大搞自然家肥，开展五净（屋、院、街、场和树底）运动和积灰积尿等。全省到1月17日，已积各种粗肥七千九百多亿斤，比去年同期增加三千五百多亿斤，而且今年积的粗肥中60％是圈肥和人粪尿等质量较好的肥料。与此同时，各地还大力进行了土化肥和细菌肥料的生产，全省已建土化肥厂和菌肥厂四万七千多个，已生产各种土化肥、菌肥一百二十亿斤。
    河北各地在开展积肥运动中，充分发挥人民公社集体力量的作用，大力组织集体积肥造肥，发展社、队、食堂的集体养猪积肥，成立积肥专业队，进行突击。各人民公社都建立了积肥专业队，只据十多个县（市）的统计，就建立了二万多个积肥专业队，队员达五十多万人。隆化县白虎沟公社建立了二十一个积肥专业队，共有三千七百九十二名劳力，三天的时间就修整厕所九百六十四个，挖了一千一百一十五个尿池，拣了七十五万五千斤大粪。这个县友谊生产大队的一百四十三人的烧火肥专业队，利用六十个炼铁小土炉烧了一百九十万斤肥。各地在组织专业积肥造肥队伍的同时，还注意开展群众性的积肥运动。目前，全省投入积肥运动的人数共达三百二十七万多人，很多地方作到了人人动手、户户积肥。
  在积肥运动中，注意政治教育与物质奖励相结合，因此调动了群众的积肥积极性。各地在大力开展社会主义与共产主义教育、组织积肥竞赛的同时，许多社都因地因社制宜的订了一些适当的奖励办法。奖励的主要形式是定额积肥超额奖励。在积肥运动中、生产队、专业队、饲养员或户，一般是根据肥源和劳力情况，经过社员讨论，实事求是的规定积肥造肥任务，超额任务适当给予精神和物质奖励。遵化县各公社开展红旗竞赛，一百五十面红旗在各生产单位流动，十天到半月评一次奖。社员利用业余时间积的肥和超额的肥，按质作价由社发给物质奖励。这样使全县两万五千名积肥专业队更加巩固，业余积肥的人数也由一万人增加到九万多人。
    在冬季开展积肥造肥的运动中，河北省一方面继续挖掘旧有肥源潜力，同时又充分利用人民公社的优越性，大力开辟新的肥源。有些人说，去年春季连续搞了两次积肥高潮，肥源不多了，有些坑泥早已挖过，厕所也搬了一次，不能连续再挖再搬。可是事实证明，肥源并没有挖绝，各地所创造和推广暖圈积肥、高温积肥、牛尾灶烧肥等办法，大大开辟了肥源。交河县先搞了十个积肥重点，然后组织现场参观，通过参观算肥源账，解放了社员思想、共挖出二十多种肥源。藁城县南董公社挖了八百多个高温沤肥坑，仅这一项造肥就解决了本社需要肥料的30％。在土制化肥方面，各地共制造了九十多种，其中肥效较高的有氮磷钾混合肥，火硝肥料，卤肥料，土制尿素等。不少地区还从地下找到了草炭。
    河北各地在积肥运动中一般都是书记挂帅，加强具体领导。在中共邯郸地委的具体领导下、这个专区从1月7日起已经掀起了一个积肥突击月运动，所辖各县都有一至三个县委书记亲自掌握这一运动。唐山专区遵化县由于县委书记亲自出马挂帅，全县有三千二百多名干部背起了粪筐和群众一起搞积肥运动，有力地推动了积肥工作。同时，不少地区还以公社为单位开办了土化肥技术人员训练班，一般要求作到每个生产队有五名以上能掌握制土化肥技术的人员，以便多制和提高土化肥的质量。　（吴中群）
