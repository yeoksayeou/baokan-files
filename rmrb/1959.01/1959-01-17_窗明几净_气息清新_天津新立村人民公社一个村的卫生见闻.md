Bright Windows and Clean Tables, Fresh Air
    ——Sanitation Observations in a Village of the Xinlicun People's Commune in Tianjin
    By Our Correspondents Hong Mingsheng and Zhu Zemin

    Zhang Guizhuang Village is an ordinary village among the ninety-one villages in the Xinlicun People's Commune in the suburbs of Tianjin. The establishment of the commune's health and healthcare network has changed the face of this ordinary village.

    As we entered the village, the morning sun shone brightly on the clean glass windows of the rows of bungalows. The corners of every house were painted with a foot-high white slurry. Next to the basketball court at the entrance of the village, groups of young and middle-aged commune members were drawing water in front of a two-story water tower. The roads in the village were also swept very clean. The entire village was divided into several sanitation zones, each with a dedicated person responsible for environmental sanitation. There were garbage cans by the roadside, and public toilets at the corners of key intersections. Regulations were also established for household and personal hygiene, with Red Cross health workers and elementary school students conducting regular inspections and evaluations. We looked inside several commune members' houses with open doors and saw that the courtyards were neatly arranged and quite clean. Jiang Delin, a 71-year-old man living in the "Home of Respect for the Elderly," said, when talking about the past appearance of the village: In the old society, there was no sanitation to speak of at all. The roads in the village were covered with excrement and garbage, and the piles of manure at the village entrance were higher than the houses. In the summer, flies and mosquitoes swarmed in droves. The water in the river was full of all kinds of dirty things. There were no wells at that time, so people had to drink dirty water. At the peak, people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases accounted for about 60% of the village's population. Today, Zhang Guizhuang's sanitary conditions have greatly improved. The commune members have written a ballad about it: "Commune members get up early to sweep the roads, sweeping the roads until they shine; kill sparrows, block rat holes, and eliminate mosquitoes and flies for the winter; from now on, our village's appearance will change, everyone will be strong and healthy; production enthusiasm breaks through the sky, three days' tasks completed in one day."

    We first visited the health station of Zhang Guizhuang Village and met a female health worker from the Second Team going to the production team. The team members were cutting reeds in the reed beds five or six miles away from the village. This young health worker wore a health worker armband on her left sleeve and carried a medicine kit on her right shoulder. On the way, she told us that the Zhang Guizhuang team had trained 164 health workers. The doctors at the health station gave the health workers lessons twice a week, teaching whatever was currently needed. Now everyone understands that if someone has indigestion, give them "Weishuping" tablets, and if someone has excessive stomach acid, give them "Soda" tablets. They also have general knowledge of first aid, nursing, and so on. The health workers carry health medicine kits with them when they go to the fields to work, so they can treat minor illnesses and injuries in a timely manner. On the way, we met the captain who was returning from the reed beds with food. He called out to the health worker from afar: "Hurry up, a commune member has cut his hand." As soon as we arrived at the reed beds, four or five commune members immediately surrounded us, asking the health worker to bandage their wounds. She skillfully bandaged them one by one, put down the medicine kit, and carried bundles of reeds with everyone. Commune member Liu Zhenbin told us that in the past, there were no health workers in the production team. If someone cut their hand, they were afraid of delaying production, so they grabbed a handful of soil to cover the wound and continued working. He remembered that when he was a teenager, he cut his foot while working. Because he used mud to stop the bleeding, it was infected with bacteria, and the wound became inflamed and festered. He stayed at home for more than a month, unable to go to the fields. This delayed production, cost more money, and caused him a lot of suffering. He said: "Now, when there are minor illnesses or injuries during production, the production team's health worker can treat them at any time, which is really convenient!"

    Returning to the village from the reed beds, Li Xiang, the secretary of the Zhang Guizhuang Party Branch, introduced us to the process of establishing a health and healthcare network in the village. He said that after the team established a health team, it had its own health station, maternity hospital, and basic professional health groups in canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, homes of respect for the elderly, commune factories, and so on, and trained a large number of health workers who did not leave production. At present, it has basically been achieved that commune members with minor illnesses or injuries do not leave the production team and are treated by health workers; mild illnesses or injuries are treated by doctors at the health station, and major illnesses or injuries are sent to the commune's health clinic; if the health clinic cannot treat them, they are sent to the city hospital in a timely manner. Commune members can generally receive medical treatment nearby when they are sick, and everyone is very satisfied. In the past, commune members with minor illnesses or injuries went to the joint clinic for treatment. Walking back and forth and waiting for the clinic took two hours. With health workers in the production team, a lot of time is saved. The health worker of the First Team can treat minor illnesses and injuries for more than a dozen people on average every day. Zhang Guizhuang has more than 2,000 people. If minor illnesses and injuries of 30 people a day can be resolved in the production team, 60 hours can be saved, which is equivalent to the full-day labor of seven and a half people.

    At noon, we went to the central canteen of the Second Team, and the scene was indeed different: there was a washing area at the entrance, with washbasins, towels, and soap, and a rinsing area at the exit. As we passed through the kitchen, we saw a large stove with nine pots, scrubbed until they shone. Vegetables were cut and dough was made with machines, which was both clean and labor-saving. The bowls and chopsticks were also scalded with boiling water. The cooks posted their guarantees on the wall: wash hands before cooking, wipe the table and sweep the floor after each meal. Wash aprons every day, wash hair every two days, and keep nails trimmed. They are cooks when they cook, waiters when they serve food, and also health workers in the canteen, taking turns to be on duty, inspecting and supervising the cleanliness of the canteen. The quality of sanitation work is one of the important conditions for their evaluation. The canteen makes more nutritious dishes and easily digestible soft rice especially for the elderly. For sick commune members, the canteen also specially makes "sick meals" for them. We sat with the commune members, eating steaming cornmeal dumplings. The commune members ate and talked, and someone said that the dumplings were fresh and hot, and eating them made you sweat and drive away the day's fatigue and cold. After eating, we talked to Xu Shanying, the leader of the canteen's health team. Why did she make the canteen so clean? She said: "The work of the canteen is very important. If the commune members eat well and are full, they will be more energetic when they go to the fields to work. In the past, at home, if we didn't pay attention to food hygiene and got sick, at most only one family would feel uncomfortable. If our canteen with more than 500 people is not clean and the commune members get sick, how much will it affect production! Since the commune members have been eating in the public canteen for more than four months, no one has been found to have gastrointestinal problems."

    Next, we went to visit the kindergarten and nursery. We saw rows of small towels hanging in the washroom. In order to ensure the health and cleanliness of the children's eyes and faces, a system of one towel per person and running water washing of hands and faces was implemented here. The childcare workers also proposed "Four Diligences": diligently wash the children's faces, hands, and bottoms; diligently wash the children's clothes and bedding; diligently change the variety of food; and diligently scald the children's bowls and spoons. Childcare worker Chen Xiuying said: They and the children's mothers also signed contracts to check and supervise each other. When the mothers send their children in the morning, they conduct a morning check on the children. If they find that the child's temperature exceeds 37 degrees Celsius, they immediately send them to the isolation room. Because they have learned simple first aid, identification and nursing of common childhood diseases from the doctors at the health station, they guarantee the health of the children. None of the 67 children in the Second Team's nursery has contracted measles so far.

    In order to take care of the physiological characteristics of women, the production team formed a women's production team. As we walked out of the nursery, we happened to meet Wang Guilan, the captain of the Second Team's women's team. She introduced us to the team's newly established "Three Adjustments and Three Non-Adjustments" women's labor protection system. When assigning farm work every day, women in their menstrual period are assigned to dry land labor, not to water land labor; pregnant women are assigned to light labor, not to heavy labor; and breastfeeding women are assigned to nearby labor, not to distant labor. Since the implementation of this system, no female commune member has said it is not good, and they work even more energetically. (Attached picture)
    Xinlicun People's Commune has basically achieved that minor illnesses and injuries do not leave the team, and mild illnesses and injuries do not leave the brigade. This is the Red Cross health worker of Zhang Guizhuang Brigade treating commune members.

    窗明几净　气息清新
    ——天津新立村人民公社一个村的卫生见闻
    本报记者　洪敏生　朱泽民
    张贵庄村是天津市郊区新立村人民公社九十一个村庄里的普通一村。公社卫生保健网的建立，改变了这个普通村庄的面貌。
    当我们走进村子，早晨的阳光，照在一排排平房的洁净的玻璃窗上，发出耀眼的光芒。家家屋子的墙角，都刷着一尺多高的白浆。在村口的篮球场旁边，成群的青壮年社员，在一个有两层楼高的水楼前打水。村子里的马路也打扫得很干净。全村划成几个卫生区，每片都有专人负责环境卫生工作。马路旁设有垃圾箱，在交通要道的路角还有公共厕所。家庭和个人的清洁卫生也都订立了制度，红十字卫生员和小学生们要定期检查评比。我们在几家敞着大门的社员屋子前，向里望了望，院子收拾得有条有理，相当整洁。住在“敬老院”里的七十一岁的老大爷蒋德麟，谈起这个村子过去的景象时说：在旧社会里，根本谈不到什么卫生，村子里的马路上是屎尿和垃圾，村头上的粪堆比房子还高。一到夏天，苍蝇蚊子成群结队。小河里的水，什么脏东西都有，当时没有井，人们只好喝脏水。闹肠胃病的人最多的时候竟占全村人口的60％左右。而今天，张贵庄的卫生面貌大大改变了，社员们为它写了一首快板诗：“社员起早把路扫，扫的道儿发亮光；扑麻雀、堵鼠洞，过冬蚊蝇铲除尽；从今我村面貌变，人人身体强又健；生产干劲冲破天，三天任务一天完。”
    我们先到张贵庄村的保健站去访问，正遇上第二小队的一个女卫生员下生产队，队员们正在离村子五、六里地的苇滩上割芦苇。这个小卫生员，左袖上套着一个卫生员的袖章，右肩背着一只药箱。在路上她告诉我们：张贵庄中队已经培养、训练了一百六十四名卫生员。保健站的大夫每周给卫生员上两次课，当前需要什么就讲什么。现在大家已经懂得了有人消化不良就给
  “胃舒平”药片，有人胃酸过多就给“苏打”片，也具备了一般的急救、护理等知识。卫生员下地生产时随身携带保健药箱，碰到一些小病小伤就可以及时医治。我们走到半路上，迎面碰到从芦苇滩送饭回来的队长，他老远就向卫生员招呼：“快去吧，有社员的手割破了。”我们刚一走到苇滩，马上就有四、五个社员围上来，请卫生员包札伤口。她熟练地给大家一一包札好了，放下医药箱，就同大家一起搬运芦苇捆子。社员刘振彬告诉我们，过去生产队里没有卫生员，有人手割破了怕耽误生产，就抓把土堵住伤口，又接着干活。他记得自己在十多岁的时候，有一次干活把脚割破了，因为用泥块堵，感染了 细菌，伤口发炎化脓，在家里养了 一个多月，没能下地，既耽误了生产，又多花了钱，人也吃了不少苦头。他说：“现在生产时有点小病小伤，生产队的卫生员随时就给医治了，真是方便！”
    从芦苇滩回到村子里，张贵庄党支部书记李祥向我们介绍了村子里建立卫生保健网的经过。他说，中队成立了卫生队以后，有了自己的保健站、产院和食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、公社工厂等基层专业卫生组，培养了大批不脱产的卫生员。目前，已基本上做到：社员小病小伤不离生产队，由卫生员处理；轻病轻伤由保健站的大夫医治，大病大伤送公社的卫生院；卫生院不能治的就及时往市里医院送。社员们有了病一般能就近就医，大家很满意。过去社员们有点小病小伤去联合诊所诊治，来回走路再加上等候门诊，就得花费两个小时。生产队有了卫生员，就节约了不少时间。第一小队的卫生员平均每天能治疗十多人的小病小伤。张贵庄有两千多人，如果每天有三十人的小病小伤在生产队解决，就可以节约六十个小时，相当于七个半人的整日劳动。
    中午，我们到第二小队的中心食堂，果然景象不同：进门的地方有一个洗手处，放着面盆、手巾和肥皂，出口的地方有嗽口处。我们穿过厨房的时候，看到一个砌着九口锅的大灶，刷洗得亮光光的，切菜、和面都是用的机器，既清洁又省力。用的碗筷也都用开水烫洗。墙上贴着炊事员们的保证：做饭前洗手，每次饭后擦一次桌子，扫一次地。围裙天天洗，两天洗一次头，勤剪指甲。她们做饭时是炊事员，开饭时是服务员，同时又是食堂的卫生员，轮流值日，检查督促食堂的清洁卫生。卫生工作的好坏，是她们评比的重要条件之一。食堂特为老人们做比较有营养的菜和容易消化的软饭。对有病的社员，食堂还专门为他们做“病号饭”。我们和社员们坐在一起，吃着热气腾腾的棒子面团，社员们边吃边谈，有人说，这面团又鲜、又热火，吃下去出一身汗，把一天的疲劳和寒冷都驱除了。吃完饭，和食堂的卫生组组长许善英谈起来，她为什么把食堂搞得这样干净？她说：“食堂工作十分重要，社员们吃好、吃饱，下地干起活来才更有劲。过去在家里，饮食卫生不注意，闹了病至多也不过一家子不舒服。咱这五百多人的大食堂，要是不干净，让社员们得了病，影响生产有多大！自从社员们在公共食堂用饭，四个多月来，还没有发现有人闹肠胃病呢。”
    接着，我们去参观幼儿园和托儿所。只见一排排小毛巾挂在盥洗室里，为了保证孩子们眼脸的健康和清洁，这里实行了一人一巾和流水冲洗手脸的制度。保育员还提出
  “四勤”：小孩脸、手、屁股洗的勤，小孩衣服被褥洗的勤，饮食花样换得勤，孩子碗勺烫得勤。保育员陈秀英说：她们和孩子妈妈还订了合同，互相检查督促。早晨妈妈们送孩子来的时候，她们要对孩子进行晨间检查，如果发现孩子体温超过三十七度就马上送到隔离室。由于她们在保健站大夫那里学习了简单的急救、儿童常见疾病的鉴别和护理，保证了孩子们的健康。第二小队托儿所的六十七个孩子，到目前没有一个得麻疹。
    生产队为了照顾妇女的生理特点，组成了妇女生产队。我们走出托儿所，正好碰上二小队的妇女队长王桂兰。她向我们介绍了小队新近建立的“三调三不调”的妇女劳动保护制度。她每天在分配农活时，对月经期的妇女，调旱地劳动，不调水地劳动；对孕妇调轻劳动不调重劳动，对哺乳期的妇女调近处劳动不调远处劳动。自从实行了这个制度以后，女社员没有一个不说好，干起活来更加有劲了。（附图片）
    新立村人民公社基本上作到了小病小伤不离小队，轻病轻伤不出中队。这是张贵庄中队的红十字卫生员在给社员治疗。
