Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: Our correspondent reports: This year is the first year for the Soviet Union to begin implementing the Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy. In order to fulfill this year's economic construction tasks, the Soviet republics are working together to strive for a new upsurge in the Soviet Union's economy. This year, they will build many new industrial enterprises and renovate and expand existing enterprises, striving for further development of industrial and agricultural production.

According to the 1959 Soviet national budget recently approved, the total budget of the Soviet republics this year will reach 345 billion rubles, an increase of more than 20 billion rubles compared with last year. This is an important guarantee for the further upsurge of national economic construction in the republics this year under more reasonable and balanced conditions.

The Russian Federal Republic, which occupies a pivotal position in the Soviet Union's economic development, will increase its total industrial output value by 7.3% this year. In terms of developing the metallurgical industry, it will produce 19.7 million tons of pig iron, an increase of 725,000 tons over last year; 32.8 million tons of steel, an increase of 1.96 million tons over last year; and 25.1 million tons of steel products, an increase of 1.6 million tons over last year. In order to increase steel production, two giant blast furnaces, eight giant open-hearth furnaces, four rolling mills, four coke ovens, and a number of iron mines with a total annual output of 6.3 million tons of ore will be built in the central and eastern regions of the republic this year.

In the Ukrainian Republic, an important industrial base of the Soviet Union, pig iron production will increase by 10.9% this year compared with last year, steel production will increase by 9.2%, and steel products will increase by 8.9%. The republic will build two giant blast furnaces, three open-hearth furnaces, and electric furnaces this year.

The iron and steel industry of the Kazakh Republic, an important newly developed metallurgical base of the Soviet Union, will also make great strides this year. This year, the republic's investment in the development of the iron and steel industry has increased by 73.5% compared with last year. In addition to the No. 1 blast furnace and two coke ovens of the Karaganda Iron and Steel Joint Plant under construction to be completed and put into production this year, the republic's main task in this regard is to carry out a large amount of exploration of ferrous and non-ferrous metal mineral resources to ensure the needs of raw materials after the completion of the Soviet Union's third iron and steel industrial base, which will be fully started in the future.

The Soviet republics have made detailed plans for the development of the chemical, fuel, and power industries. According to the plan, more than 140 chemical industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union have now started construction or are about to start construction. The Azerbaijan Republic will become one of the most developed republics in the Soviet chemical industry. This year, the republic's basic construction investment of 268 million rubles will be mainly used for the development of the chemical and petroleum industries. The Russian Federal Republic's investment in the development of the chemical industry this year has increased by 70% compared with last year. In terms of fuel production, the Russian Federal Republic's oil production this year will increase to 101 million tons, and gas production will increase to 7.8 billion cubic meters. Ukrainian coal has always occupied an important position in the Soviet Union's total coal production, and its coal production will reach a new peak this year. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the total coal production in Ukraine should increase to 211 million tons by 1965. However, the republic's coal production this year can reach 170.5 million tons. Fourteen new mines with an annual output of 6.5 million tons of coal will be built in Donbass and other places. Due to the construction of the three major thermal power plants in the Urals, Krasnoyarsk Krai, and Kemerovo Oblast, and the start of power generation by many hydraulic units of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, the Russian Federation's power production this year will increase by 12.1%. The Tianshan Power Station in the Kyrgyz Republic and the Kremenchug Hydropower Station on the Dnieper River in the Ukrainian Republic will also be completed this year and begin to supply electricity to nearby industrial areas.

This year, thousands of new-style machines will be manufactured in the Soviet republics. For example, the Russian Federal Republic will increase the production of new high-speed electronic computers by 30% this year compared with last year. Steam turbines with a power of 300,000, 400,000, and 600,000 kilowatts will also be trial-produced. In addition, the production of complex automated devices manufactured for the metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building industries will increase by more than 60% compared with last year.

In terms of agricultural production, this year is of great significance for the Soviet republics to strive to implement the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on further developing agricultural production adopted at its plenary session in December last year. After the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the agricultural workers of the republics greeted the 1959 production increase tasks with full confidence and carried out various preparations. The Russian Federal Republic decided to increase grain production to 5 billion poods this year (each pood is equivalent to 32.76 market catties), which is equivalent to the total grain output of the entire Soviet Union in 1953; milk, meat, and wool production will increase by 11.6%, 12.5%, and 10.7% respectively compared with last year. The Ukrainian Republic's grain production will also be greatly increased this year, and the production of sugar beets, corn, and industrial crops will be greatly developed. While ensuring the continued increase in grain production, the Kazakh Republic also guarantees to increase cotton production to 192,000 tons and sugar beet to 1.22 million tons this year. The three republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, which have exceeded the United States in terms of milk and meat production per capita, will further become specialized areas of animal husbandry production this year. The republics of Central Asia will further develop the production of cotton, fruits, and tea this year.

The completion of the production plan of the Soviet republics this year will be of great significance for further creating a solid material foundation and for completing the Seven-Year Plan. (Attached pictures)

    同心协力合奏七年计划第一曲凯歌
    苏联各加盟共和国比翼齐飞
    今年将各展所长努力争取工农业生产新高涨
    新华社莫斯科14日电　本社记者报道：今年是苏联开始实现发展国民经济七年计划的第一年。为了完成这一年的经济建设任务，苏联各加盟共和国正在同心协力争取全苏联经济的新高涨。它们在今年将建设许多新的工业企业并改建和扩大现有的企业，力争工农业生产的进一步发展。
    根据不久以前通过的1959年苏联国家预算，今年苏联各加盟共和国的预算总额达三千四百五十亿卢布，比去年增加了二百多亿卢布。这是使今年各加盟共和国国民经济建设在更加合理、更加平衡的条件下进一步高涨的重要保证。
    在苏联发展国民经济中占有举足轻重的地位的俄罗斯联邦共和国，今年工业总产值将比去年增加7.3％，在发展冶金工业方面，要生产生铁一千九百七十万吨，即比去年增产七十二万五千吨；钢三千二百八十万吨，即比去年增产一百九十六万吨；钢材二千五百一十万吨，即比去年增产一百六十万吨。为了增加钢铁产量，今年将在共和国中部和东部地区兴建两座巨型高炉、八座巨型平炉、四座轧钢机、四个炼焦炉和一些总共年产六百三十万吨矿砂的铁矿。
    在苏联重要的工业基地乌克兰共和国，今年生铁生产要比去年增加10.9％，钢增产9.2％，钢材增加8.9％，共和国将在今年建设两座巨型高炉、三座平炉和电炉。
    苏联新开辟的重要冶金基地哈萨克共和国的钢铁工业今年也将大踏步地前进。今年共和国在发展钢铁工业方面的投资比去年增加了73.5％。除了兴建中的卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂的第一号高炉和两座炼焦炉要在今年建成并投入生产外，共和国在这方面的主要任务是大量地进行黑色与有色金属矿藏资源的勘探，以保证将来全面兴工的苏联第三个钢铁工业基地建成后对原料的需要。
    在发展化学、燃料、电力工业方面，苏联各加盟共和国作了详细的规划。根据计划，全苏联各地一百四十多个化学工业企业现在已经动工建设或即将开始建设。阿塞拜疆共和国将成为苏联化学工业最发达的共和国之一，共和国今年的二亿六千八百万卢布基本建设投资，主要用于发展化学和石油工业。俄罗斯联邦共和国今年在发展化学工业方面的投资比去年增加了70％。在燃料生产方面，俄罗斯联邦共和国今年的石油产量将增加到一亿零一百万吨，瓦斯产量将增加到七十八亿立方公尺。乌克兰的煤在苏联整个产煤量中一直占重要的地位，今年它的煤产量将登上新的高峰。七年计划规定，乌克兰总产煤量到1965年应增加到二亿一千一百万吨，但是，共和国今年的产煤量就能达到一亿七千零五十万吨。年产量为六百五十万吨煤的十四个新矿井将在顿巴斯等地兴建起来。由于乌拉尔、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区和基米罗伏州的三大火力发电站的兴建和斯大林格勒水电站的许多水力联动机开始发电，俄罗斯联邦今年的电力生产将增加12.1％。吉尔吉斯共和国的天山发电站、乌克兰共和国第聂伯河上的克里门楚格水电站也将在今年建成并开始给附近的工业区送电。
    今年，上千种新式机器将在苏联各共和国制造出来。例如，俄罗斯联邦共和国今年生产的新型高速电子计算机将比去年增产30％。功率达三十万、四十万和六十万瓩的汽轮机也要试制出来。此外，为冶金、化学、机器制造工业制造的复杂的自动化装置将比去年增产60％以上。
    在农业生产方面，今年是苏联各加盟共和国争取实现苏共中央去年12月全体会议关于进一步发展农业生产的决议具有重大意义的一年。苏共中央十二月全会后，各共和国的农业劳动者都信心百倍地迎接了1959年增产任务，并进行了各种准备工作。俄罗斯联邦共和国决定今年把粮食产量增加到五十亿普特
  （每普特合三十二点七六市斤），即相当于1953年全苏联粮食的总产量；牛奶、肉类、羊毛产量分别比去年增产11.6％、12.5％、10.7％。乌克兰共和国的粮食生产今年也要大大提高，并将大量发展甜菜、玉蜀黍和技术作物的生产。哈萨克共和国在保证使粮食继续增产的同时，今年还保证把棉花产量增加到十九万二千吨、甜菜增加到一百二十二万吨。在按人口计算的牛奶、肉类产量方面已超过了美国的拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚三个共和国，今年将进一步成为畜牧业生产专业化的地区。中亚细亚各共和国今年将进一步发展棉花、水果和茶叶的生产。
    今年苏联各加盟共和国生产计划的完成，对于进一步创造雄厚的物质基础，为完成七年计划将有重大的意义。（附图片）
