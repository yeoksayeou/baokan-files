Visiting the Northern Tibetan Grasslands
Guo Chaoren

Last June, I rode horseback to visit the Northern Tibetan Grasslands. At that time, the grasslands, over 4,000 meters above sea level, were lush with grass and flowing with streams, it was the early spring season. Now it is the dead of winter, I followed a work team to the western region of Tibet and came to the Northern Tibetan Grasslands again. The grasslands are now a silver world, covered in ice and snow, a different kind of scenery...

Traveling here is like sailing on the vast ocean. Looking out, the yellow-orange grass, layer upon layer, stretches endlessly. The vast and wide lakes seem very delicate in comparison, even the snow-capped mountains that stretch for thousands of kilometers are prostrate, revealing only a line of white light. People seem even smaller here.

In the distance, there are faintly visible snow-capped mountains, perhaps that is the end of the grassland! Getting closer, turning past the mountain bend, before your eyes is another vast grassland. Now, the scenery before us begins to change, the grass gradually becomes sparse, and clumps of desert plants, camel thorns, appear. It seems to be telling people that the grassland has ended, but in the blink of an eye, it is another beautiful pasture. Traveling here on horseback, you will feel anxious, even if you drive a car at a frantic speed, tens of kilometers, hundreds of kilometers pass, thousands of kilometers pass, you still cannot find the edge of the grassland anywhere...

How big is the Northern Tibetan Grassland? There is no exact data yet. It is only known that hundreds of diligent and simple herdsmen tribes settle and nomad on this land. The livestock they graze accounts for one-third of the total number of livestock in Tibet, and they supply hundreds of thousands of catties of meat, butter, wool and hides to the Tibetan market every year, making it one of the most important pastoral areas in Tibet.

There is a folk song that says:

　　The grass in Northern Tibet is good,
　　Meat and milk cannot be eaten up.
　　The cattle and sheep in Northern Tibet are strong,
　　Meat and milk cannot be finished.

The grass on the Northern Tibetan Grasslands belongs to a type of sedge family, generally more than four inches long, and can grow to one foot high in places with sufficient water. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a scientific work team that entered Tibet with the People's Liberation Army troops experimented with sowing pasture grass from North China and Inner Mongolia on the Northern Tibetan Grasslands. The result was good growth, and it is foreseeable that in the near future, the Northern Tibetan Grasslands will become one of the most abundant pastoral areas in our country.

People traveling here often indulge in the vast and majestic scenery of the grassland. Before they even notice, its depths contain even more alluring treasures and wealth. Not long ago, a geological exploration team took a casual trip here and discovered thirty or forty kinds of precious minerals. In many unknown places, an ordinary passerby found many kinds of ores.

In a remote basin I passed through, the oil exploration team found many good oil structures. According to preliminary estimates, they will all become our country's natural large oil depots.

The area with dense lake groups in the central part of the Northern Tibetan Grasslands is also the hometown of rare chemical raw materials in our country.

According to geological data, during the Jurassic period in geological history, the entire Northern Tibetan Grassland was a vast ocean. After a long period of time, the earth's crust underwent violent vibrations. The seabed rose upwards, and the seawater was discharged to low-lying areas and dried up. Therefore, many kinds of marine-specific minerals and chemical elements have been discovered successively on the Northern Tibetan Grasslands. The huge borax lake, the abundant mirabilite and saline-alkali areas are rare in the world. As for other chemical raw materials such as barite, sulfur, and gypsum, the reserves are countless. Only one lake area that has already begun to be mined has the conditions to become one of the largest chemical bases in our country.

In recent decades, many foreign "travelers" have successively spied on the Northern Tibetan Grasslands. Although they coveted this place, they verbally described Northern Tibet as "barren" and "cold," saying such nonsense as "humans and animals cannot survive," etc.

The facts are not like this at all.

The Northern Tibetan Grasslands are relatively high above sea level and surrounded by mountains on all sides. The climate is a purely continental climate, with large temperature differences between day and night, low rainfall, and relatively cold, but not that extremely cold. According to a survey, the Bangor Lake area in the central part of the Northern Tibetan Grasslands can be regarded as a representative of Northern Tibet in terms of geographical conditions and climate conditions, and the data accumulated by the Bangor Lake Meteorological Station in previous years tell us that the absolute minimum temperature throughout the year is only minus twenty-nine degrees Celsius, which is warmer than some areas in northern China. There are five months of growing season throughout the year (daytime temperature above zero degrees Celsius), which can grow vegetables and some crops.

The Heihe area, which has a climate similar to Bangor Lake, has also always been regarded as an agricultural forbidden zone in the past, but after people's efforts, the highland barley planted last year had full grains and good yields. Vegetables were not only successfully trial-planted but also achieved a bumper harvest. The first batch of poplar and willow saplings planted also sprouted and survived.

Don't believe those lies that slander the Northern Tibetan Grasslands! As long as you travel here in person, live on the banks of those small rivers and large lakes, take a look at the rich pastures, smell the fragrance of the grass, and listen to the singing of the simple Northern Tibetan herdsmen, you will sincerely say: "The Northern Tibetan Grasslands are really a good place!"

### 访藏北草原

    访藏北草原
    郭超人
    去年6月，我骑马访问过藏北草原，那时这拔海四千多公尺的草原上，牧草茂绿，溪水淙淙，正是初春季节。现在隆冬了，我随一支工作队到西藏西部地区去，又来到藏北草原，草原上银装素谷，冰封雪盖，另是一番景色……
    在这里旅行，好像航行在大洋大海里。望过去，黄橙橙的牧草，一层又一层，漫无边际。纵横广阔的巨大湖泊相形之下也十分纤巧，就连那绵延数千公里的雪山也匍伏着，只露出一线白光，人在这里更显得渺小。
    远处，呈现着隐隐的雪山，那儿也许是草原的尽头！走近了，拐过山弯，眼前又是另一片广阔的草地。现在，眼前的景色开始改变了，牧草渐渐稀疏，出现了一丛丛沙漠上的植物骆驼刺，它好像告诉人们，草原已经结束，但一转眼，又是一片美妙的牧场。骑马在这里旅行，你会感到焦急，即便坐汽车以发狂的速度奔驰前进，几十公里，几百公里过去了，上千公里又过去了，你仍然无法找到草原的边缘在什么地方……
    藏北草原有多大？现在还没有确切的资料。只知道在这片土地上，定居和游牧着数百个勤劳朴实的牧人部落，他们放牧的牲畜占西藏牲畜总头数的三分之一，每年向西藏市场上供应着数十万斤肉类，酥油，羊毛和皮张，是西藏最主要的牧区之一。
    有一首歌谣说：
        藏北牧草好，
        肉奶吃不了。
        藏北牛羊壮，
        肉奶吃不完。
    藏北草原上的牧草属莎草科中的一类，一般长四寸多，在水份充足的地方能长到一尺高。西藏和平解放后，随人民解放军部队进藏的一支科学工作队，曾试验把华北和内蒙古的牧草种撒在藏北草原上，结果生长很好，可以预料，不久的将来，藏北草原将会成为我国最丰饶的牧区之一。
    在这里旅行的人，往往容易沉恋于草原那广阔雄伟的景色，还不注意，在它的地底，蕴藏着更加诱人的丰富的宝藏和财富。不久前，一支地质勘探队在这里随便走了一趟，就发现三、四十种贵重的矿藏，在许多不知名的地方，一个普通的过路人就发现了不少种矿石。
    在我走过的一个偏僻的盆地里，石油勘探队找到了许多个良好的石油构造，据初步估计，它们都将成为我国的天然大油库。
    在藏北草原中部湖群密集的地区，更是我国少有的化工原料的故乡。
    据地质资料说，在地质史上的侏儸纪时期，整个藏北草原是一片汪洋大海，经过漫长的年代，地壳发生了剧烈的震动。海底向上隆起，海水被排到低地而干涸。因此，在藏北草原上，陆续发现了许多种海洋里特有的矿产和化学元素。那巨大的硼砂湖，丰富的芒硝和盐碱地区，都是世界少有的。至于像重晶石，硫磺、石膏等其他许多种化工原料，藏量更是不计其数。仅一个目前已经开始开采了的湖区，就有条件成为我国最大的化工基地之一。
    近几十年来，不少外国的“旅行家”先后窥伺过藏北草原，尽管他们对这块地方垂涎欲滴，但他们口头上却把藏北说得那样“荒凉”“寒冷”，说什么“人畜不能生存”等鬼话。
    事实完全不是这样。
    藏北草原拔海较高，四面山岭环抱，气候是纯大陆性气候，昼夜温差大，雨量少，也比较冷，但是并不那样酷寒。据调查，藏北草原中部一个名叫班戈湖的地区，在地理条件，气候情况上可作为藏北的代表，而班戈湖气象站前年来积累的资料告诉我们，这全年中绝对最低温不过摄氏零下二十九度，比我国北方某些地区还暖，全年中有五个月的生长期（白昼温度在摄氏零度以上），可以生长蔬菜和部分农作物。
    与班戈湖气候相近的黑河地区，过去也一直被看作是农业禁区，但是经过人们的努力，去年试种的青稞颗粒饱满，产量也好，蔬菜不仅试种成功而且获得了丰收，栽种的第一批杨柳树苗，也抽芽成活。
    不要听信那些污蔑藏北草原的谎话！只要你亲身在这里旅行一趟，在那小河和大湖岸边住一住，看一看那丰美的牧场，闻一闻牧草的清香，听一听朴实的藏北牧人的歌唱，你就会由衷地说：“藏北草原真是个好地方！”
