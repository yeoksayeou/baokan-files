    Party Members and League Members Take the Lead in Accumulating Fertilizer
    Recently, our county launched a massive mass fertilizer accumulation campaign. The county party secretary not only personally led the fertilizer accumulation campaign, but also took the lead in smoking fertilizer. Most of the 1,410 cadres above the brigade level in the county took off their shoes and socks, put on straw hats, carried manure baskets, and shouldered hoes to go down to the water and up the mountains to accumulate fertilizer. Zhao Guilin, a squad leader of the Lao Sai Brigade of the Dama Commune, led the masses to climb the mountains in the wind and snow to accumulate fertilizer. Their slogan was "Take down Snow Mountain Ridge, get fertilizer as if getting food." The Wuxing Commune and Zhushi Commune also organized two expeditionary commando teams to accumulate fertilizer on the Daling Ridge, which is ten miles away.
    Under the active leadership of party members, league members, and cadres, a mass upsurge of fertilizer accumulation quickly swept the county, achieving fertilizer accumulation in paddy fields, fertilizer in every pond; burning and smoking in dry fields, smoke rising everywhere; household fertilizer leaving the house, mineral fertilizer being unearthed, mountain fertilizer coming down the mountain, and water fertilizer going ashore. By January 12, the county had accumulated more than 330 million dan of various native miscellaneous fertilizers, averaging 689 dan per mu of cultivated land; in addition, more than 150,000 dan of various chemical fertilizers had been manufactured, averaging 45 jin per mu.

    党员团员带头积肥
    我们县里，最近开展了一个声势浩大的群众性积肥运动。县委书记不但亲自领导积肥运动，还带头熏肥。全县一千四百一十名大队以上的干部，大多数脱下鞋袜、戴上斗笠、挑着粪箕、扛着锄头，下水上山积肥。大麻公社老塞大队一个中队长赵桂林，带领群众冒着风雪上山积肥。他们的口号是“拿下雪山岭，取肥如取粮”。五星公社和竹市公社还组织了两个远征突击队，到十里外的大岭上去积肥。
    在党员团员和干部的积极带动下，全县迅速地掀起了群众性的积肥高潮，做到水田沤凼，凼凼有肥；旱田烧熏，处处冒烟；家肥出门，矿肥出土，山肥下山，水肥上岸。到1月12日，全县已积了各种土杂肥料三亿三千多万担，平均每亩耕地可有六百八十九担；另外还制造了各种化肥十五万多担，平均每亩有四十五斤。
