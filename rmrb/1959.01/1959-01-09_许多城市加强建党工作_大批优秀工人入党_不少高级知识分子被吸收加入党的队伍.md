Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: With the development of industry, many cities have strengthened their party building work, and accepted a large number of outstanding members of the working class into the Party. In 1958, the organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou and other places admitted more than 16,000 worker activists into the Party.

    Among the new party members admitted by the Tianjin Party organization last year, more than 6,800 were outstanding soldiers on the industrial front. They accepted the education of the Communist Party, established a communist outlook on life, actively responded to the Party's call on various industrial fronts, and worked hard to complete the national task. They worked selflessly in the battle for steel, and many were steelmaking experts. Among the more than 450 new party members admitted by the Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, advanced producers and model workers accounted for more than 80%. Among the 96 new party members admitted by the Party Committee of the Beishi District of Shenyang City, 62 were advanced workers and red banner bearers of the province, city and district. These new party members have generally undergone long-term training and education by the Party and the test of various political movements, have a firm stance, can closely connect with the masses, and have a high degree of communist consciousness. Lu Foxiang, a technician from the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, has made dozens of important inventions and creations in recent years, making great contributions to the country. He has been awarded the title of model worker and advanced worker for five consecutive years. Usually, he loves the factory like his home. In 1958, when he suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and was recuperating in a sanatorium, he still kept the work in the factory in mind. He specially asked for leave to return to the factory to install a large flywheel. He accidentally injured his back during work, but he was afraid of delaying the installation work, so he continued to work as usual. The masses affectionately called him "Steel Man." Li Yumin, a new party member of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, actively studied technology, united the masses, and improved four kinds of milling cutters during the Great Leap Forward, increasing production efficiency by more than ten times. He was rated as an advanced worker in the city and was selected to attend the Second National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists. Wang Qiuxiang, the leader of the youth commando team of the Shanghai No. 3 Construction Company, was a young socialist construction activist in Shanghai last year. The youth commando team he led worked hard to learn multiple skills. Now the entire team has mastered more than a dozen technologies, and he himself has learned seven technologies including concrete, lifting, plastering, bricklaying, electric welding, painting, and glass.

    Before admitting these outstanding workers into the Party, the Party organizations in various places, in addition to conducting strict political and ideological reviews, paid special attention to systematically conducting communist education for them. Some party organizations adopted the method of absorbing them to attend party classes to improve their ideological awareness, and some planned to assign them to complete arduous tasks so that they could get more opportunities for exercise. After they were approved to join the party, their enthusiasm was even higher. After Liu Yuwen, a young worker from Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, was approved as a probationary party member, he decided to make more contributions to the party. He tried various methods to improve the centerless launcher, and finally succeeded, increasing production efficiency by seventy times, greatly promoting workshop production.

    Among the new party members developed in various cities, there are also many senior intellectuals. Wang Yinglai, director of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wang Deliang, vice president of South China Normal College, Kang Xinyuan, vice president of South China Institute of Chemical Technology, Chen Xintao, parasitologist of Zhongshan Medical College, famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor Feng Deyi, and film actress Bai Yang, etc., joined the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai and Guangzhou last year. Some of them actively participated in the democratic revolutionary movement before liberation. After liberation, they have consistently actively supported and implemented the Party's line, principles and policies, participated in the political movements led by the Party, conscientiously transformed their thinking, worked hard to improve their level of awareness, and have undergone tests and training in the rectification and anti-Rightist struggles.

    许多城市加强建党工作
    大批优秀工人入党
    不少高级知识分子被吸收加入党的队伍
    新华社8日讯　随着工业的发展，许多城市加强了建党工作，接收了大批工人阶级中的优秀分子入党。1958年，中共北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州等地组织，共接收了一万六千多名工人积极分子入党。
    天津市党组织在去年接收的新党员中，有六千八百多名是工业战线上的优秀战士，他们接受共产党的教育，树立了共产主义人生观，在各个工业战线上积极响应党的号召，努力完成国家任务；在为钢而战中忘我劳动，有许多是炼钢能手。中共上海市建筑工程局党委接收的四百五十多名新党员中，先进生产者和劳动模范占80％以上。中共沈阳市北市区党委接收的九十六名新党员中，有六十二名是省、市和区的先进工作者和红旗手。这些新党员一般都经过党的长期培养教育和各项政治运动的考验，立场坚定，能密切联系群众，具有较高的共产主义觉悟。上钢二厂工人出身的技师鲁佛祥，几年来重要发明创造有几十项，对国家有很大贡献，他曾连续五年获得劳动模范和先进工作者的称号。平时，他爱厂如家，1958年他患风湿性关节炎在疗养所休养时，还念念不忘厂内的工作，曾特地请假回厂安装大飞轮。在工作中不慎碰伤了背部，他深怕耽误安装工作，仍旧照常工作，群众都感动地称他为“钢人”。沈阳第二机床厂新党员李裕民，在大跃进中积极钻研技术，团结群众，改进了四种铣刀，提高生产效率十倍多，被评为市的先进工作者，并被选出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。上海市第三建筑公司青年突击队队长王秋祥是去年上海市青年社会主义建设积极分子，他领导的青年突击队努力学习多面手，现在全队已掌握了十多种技术，他本人就学会了混凝土、起重、粉刷、砌墙、电焊、油漆、玻璃等七种技术。
    各地党组织在接收这些优秀工人入党以前，除了在政治上、思想上进行严格审查以外，特别注意有系统地向他们进行共产主义教育。有的党组织采取吸收他们上党课的办法来提高思想觉悟，有的有计划分配他们去完成艰巨的工作，使他们得到更多锻炼的机会。他们在被批准入党以后，积极性更加高涨。沈阳第二机床厂青年工人刘玉文被批准为预备党员以后，决心为党做出更多的贡献，他曾想了各种办法来改进无心发射器，最后终于成功，提高了生产效率七十倍，大大推动了车间生产。
    各城市发展的新党员中，还有不少高级知识分子。中国科学院生物化学研究所所长王应睐，华南师范学院副院长汪德亮，华南化工学院副院长康辛元，中山医学院寄生虫学家陈心陶，名中医冯德瑜以及电影演员白杨等，去年都分别在上海和广州加入了中国共产党。他们中有的人在解放前就积极参加了民主革命运动。解放后，他们都一贯积极拥护和执行党的方针政策，参加党领导的历次政治运动，认真改造思想，努力提高自己的觉悟水平，并在整风和反右派斗争中，经过了考验和锻炼。
