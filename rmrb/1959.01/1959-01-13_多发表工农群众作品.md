Publish More Works by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

    Opening this year's January issue of "Hunan Literature" (formerly "New Seedlings"), the reader gets a very strong impression that the authorial ranks are very broad. There are writers, but also workers and peasants, a deputy governor and a county party secretary, enterprise management personnel, and also cadres sent to lower levels. In particular, the proportion of works by workers and peasants is large. Of the nine novels and essays published in the magazine, four were created by workers and peasants. The "Factory History and Commune History" section contains two articles, both of which are works by workers and peasants. The poetry section includes workers' Leap Forward short songs and peasants' Spring Festival songs. Even more valuable are the peasants' experiences in studying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, and the workers' symposium opinions on revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Although these works are not yet very mature, they vividly and intimately reflect the surging lives of the people and the new spirit and style of the heroic figures who are creating a happy life; they also demonstrate the cultural improvement of workers and peasants after eliminating illiteracy. As the "Hunan Literature" editorial "Extensive Popularization, Rapid Improvement" says: on the one hand, outstanding revolutionary literary and artistic achievements must be widely popularized among the masses; on the other hand, it is also necessary to mobilize the broad masses of people to engage in literary and artistic creation for a long time, that is, to constantly strive to realize the mass popularization of literature and art. Only in this way can it help "intellectualize workers and peasants and make intellectuals more working class," and can literature and art be combined with the working people on a larger scale and to a greater depth.

    多发表工农群众作品
    翻开今年出版的“湖南文学”（原名“新苗”）一月号，给读者一个非常强烈的印象，就是作者的队伍很宽广。有作家，也有工人和农民、副省长和县委书记，有企业管理人员，还有下放干部。尤其工人和农民的作品比例大。刊物上刊登的九篇小说和散文中，就有四篇是工人和农民的创作。工厂史和公社史一栏，登了两篇，都是工农作品。诗歌中有工人写的跃进短歌，农民唱出的迎春曲。更可贵的是，还有农民写的学习毛主席文艺思想的心得，工人关于革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义的座谈意见。这些作品虽然还不是很成熟的，但它生动而亲切地反映了万马奔腾的生活，反映了创造幸福生活的英雄人物的新精神、新风格；也表现了在扫除了文盲以后的工农群众在文化上的提高。正如“湖南文学”社论“大量普及，迅速提高”中所说的：一方面，优秀的革命文艺成果，必须大量地普及到群众中去，另一方面，还必须长期地动员广大人民来从事文学艺术的创作活动，也就是要不断地为实现文学艺术向全民大普及而奋斗。这样，才能有助于“工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化”，才能使文学艺术在更大范围和更深程度上与劳动人民相结合。　　（坚）
