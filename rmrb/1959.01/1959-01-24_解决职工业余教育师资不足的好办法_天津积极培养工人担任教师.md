A Good Way to Solve the Shortage of Teachers in Workers' Spare-Time Education
Tianjin Actively Trains Workers to Serve as Teachers

(Our Tianjin dispatch) In conducting workers' spare-time education, Tianjin is actively training workers with relatively rich production and political struggle experience and a certain level of education to serve as teachers. By relying on its own efforts and using local resources, it is solving the problem of insufficient teachers. According to incomplete statistics from the city's six districts, more than 1,900 workers have recently been transferred from various factories to serve as full-time and part-time teachers in workers' spare-time schools, becoming a vital new force in the ranks of teachers in workers' spare-time education. Together with the original teachers, they are playing a good role in the cause of workers' spare-time education.

The characteristics of these worker-teachers are their enthusiasm, familiarity with production, and understanding of workers' lives and learning requirements. However, their educational level is generally not very high, they lack teaching experience, and their professional skills are rusty. Therefore, after transferring workers to serve as teachers, each district, based on their different educational levels and following the principles of taking care of the present and considering the long term, adopted various methods combining long-term and short-term training, and on-the-job and off-the-job training. Hongqiao, Nankai, and other districts established worker-peasant teacher training schools or teacher continuing education colleges, adopting the method of learning while teaching to systematically study cultural and teaching professional knowledge. The worker-peasant teacher training school in Hongqiao District also adopted the method of "single-subject breakthrough, comprehensive study." For example, worker-teachers who teach junior high school Chinese not only focus on learning the Chinese course well, but also cultivate other subjects to reach the level of general high school graduates. For worker-teachers with relatively high educational levels, districts and some factories used short-term rotational training in the form of training classes and teacher professional development classes to solve the problem of their insufficient professional knowledge, focusing on improving their teaching professional level. For example, the short-term training class held in Nankai District used about a month to explain to new teachers the party's education policy, teaching methods, and through listening to lectures by experienced teachers, introducing experiences, internships, and other methods, so that new teachers could initially grasp general professional knowledge. At the same time, during centralized training, each district also organized experienced teachers to guide new teachers, so that the teaching experience of the old teachers and the production practice of the worker-teachers could be combined, exchanging experiences and learning from each other's strengths to make the teaching content better. Hongqiao District divided the entire district into fifteen school districts, with each district being responsible for a key school, organizing more than 730 worker-teachers to collectively prepare lessons by region and subject, hold educational lectures, exchange experiences, and conduct tutoring by experienced teachers. Nankai District also established a tutoring network, with full-time tutors in each area, going deep into factories to tutor worker-teachers in preparing lessons, teaching classes, compiling teaching outlines, compiling lecture notes, and so on.

This group of worker-teachers is now studying to improve their cultural level while teaching junior high school or higher elementary school courses. Because they are familiar with production and workers' lives, and after a period of training, they have initially mastered teaching skills, and the teaching effect is generally very good. These worker-teachers have a deep understanding of the workers' urgent need for knowledge. They have a strong sense of political responsibility, study diligently, and try every means to improve their professional ability and teaching quality. Worker-teachers Huang Huici and others from the Daxin Weaving Factory in Hongqiao District not only studied the teaching materials diligently, but also often went to worker spare-time schools outside the factory to observe and visit, learning teaching skills. After each lecture, they separately solicited the opinions of the workers and tried to combine the production situation in the factory with teaching, which was very popular with the workers. When worker-teacher Zhang Guanghui from the Chunhe Weaving Factory taught percentages, he combined it with the method workers use to calculate the output of cloth every day, which not only inspired the workers' interest in learning, made them understand quickly, but also enabled them to quickly apply it to production practice.

    解决职工业余教育师资不足的好办法
    天津积极培养工人担任教师
    本报天津电　天津市在举办职工业余教育中，积极培养生产和政治斗争经验比较丰富并有一定文化水平的工人担任教师，自力更生，就地取材，解决师资不足的问题。据市内六个区的不完全统计，最近从各厂抽调了一千九百多名工人担任职工业余学校的专职教师和兼职教师，成为工人业余教育师资队伍中的一支生力军。他们和原有的教师一起，在职工业余教育事业中发挥了良好的作用。
    这些工人教师的特点是积极热情、熟悉生产情况、了解工人的生活和学习要求；但是他们文化水平一般还不很高，缺乏教学经验，业务生疏。因此，各区在抽调工人担任教师以后，根据他们的不同文化程度，从照顾目前、考虑长远的原则出发，分别以长期与短期培训、业余与脱产培养相结合的多种多样办法进行培训。红桥、南开等区成立了工农师范学校或教师进修学院，采取边教边学的办法系统学习文化和教学业务知识。红桥区的工农师范学校还采取“单科突进、全面学习”的办法，例如教初中语文的工人教师不仅集中学好语文课程，而且其它学科也要培养达到一般高中毕业生的水平。对文化水平比较高的工人教师，各区和一部分工厂分别以训练班、教师业务进修班等短期轮训的方式，解决他们业务知识不足的问题，着重提高教学业务水平。如南开区举办的短期训练班，以一个月左右的时间，向新教师讲解党的教育方针政策、教学方法，并通过听老教师讲课，介绍经验，实习等方式，使新教师初步掌握一般业务知识。同时，各区在集中培训的时候，还组织老教师辅导新教师，使老教师的教学经验和工人教师的生产实践结合起来，互相交流，取长补短，以更好的充实教学内容。红桥区把全区划分成十五个学区，每区由一个重点学校负责，组织七百三十多名工人教师分片、分科集体备课、举办教育讲座、交流经验和由有经验的教师进行辅导。南开区还设立了一个辅导网，在各片都有专职辅导员，深入工厂辅导工人教师备课，上课、编写教学大纲，编讲义等等。
    这批工人教师现在一面学习提高文化水平，一面担任初中或高小课程的教学工作。由于他们熟悉生产和工人的生活，经过一个时期的培训，已初步掌握了教学业务，教学效果一般都很好。这些工人教师对工人迫切需要知识有深刻的体会，他们政治责任心强，刻苦钻研，想尽办法提高自己的业务能力和教学质量。红桥区大新织布厂工人教师黄惠慈等人，不但苦钻教材，还经常到厂外工人业余学校去观摩、访问，学习教学业务。他们在每讲一课以后，就分别征求工人的意见，并且试着结合厂内生产情况进行教学，很受工人的欢迎。春和织布厂工人教师张广惠讲百分法时，结合工人每天计算布的产量方法来讲解，不但启发了工人学习的兴趣，使他们理解的快，而且还能很快应用到生产实际中去。
