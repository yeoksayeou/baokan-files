Window on the Leap Forward

    Nylon 11
    The Suzhou Light Industry and Chemical Industry Bureau's Chemical Research Office has recently produced chemically synthesized fiber – Nylon 11, and has already put it into production.
    Nylon 11 is a new type of synthetic plastic fiber. It has good insulation properties, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance. It can be used to manufacture valuable items such as military parachutes, automobile tires, marine fishing nets, aircraft fuel tanks, and artificial internal organs. (Pan Weixing)
