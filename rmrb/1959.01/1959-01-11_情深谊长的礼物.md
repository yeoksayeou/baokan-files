    Deep and Profound Gifts of Friendship
    The leading organs of the Fujian front-line troops recently received a wooden box, emanating a fragrant apple scent.

    Who sent this batch of apples from Beijing? It was later clarified: In November last year, during Premier Kim Il-sung's visit to our country, the Korean government sent a batch of sweet apples. One portion was given to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The comrades of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications gave it to the comrades who participated in voluntary labor at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. After serious deliberation, they transferred it to the iron and steel workers of Shijingshan. The workers felt that this gift was filled with deep affection, and no one was willing to eat it. Thus, these apples traveled thousands of kilometers again and were sent to the Fujian front lines.

    After receiving this gift, the leading organs of the front-line troops, after careful consideration, decided to distribute it to the naval, artillery, and air force units and the heroically wounded heroes who had made significant contributions in punishing the enemy. On New Year's Eve in 1958, five apples were sent to an air force unit on the front lines. After repeated discussions, the air force comrades felt that the victory on the front lines was the result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the strong support of the people. They sent this apple to the local Party committee and distributed it to workers and peasants. After discussions among the workers and peasants, they believed that the air force soldiers should receive this reward. These five apples were sent back to the air force unit. When the apples arrived at the airport, the soldiers guarding under the wings and on the runway all spread the good news, gently touching these extraordinary apples, but no one shared it. They sent it to a people's commune that created a provincial high yield record and large-scale high yield last year.

    The commune members accepted the apples, packed them in a wooden box, and displayed them in the commune's "Red Flag Hall." The commune members talked about the origin of these apples with great excitement, determined to create greater achievements in industrial and agricultural production and construction and in supporting the front lines this year.

    The apples now sent to the front-line navy, artillery, and other units are still being transferred from one unit to another. Wherever it spreads, it brings great strength to the people there.

    情深谊长的礼物
    福建前线部队领导机关最近收到一个木箱，箱里散发出一股清香的苹果味。
    是什么人把这批苹果从北京寄来的？后来才弄清楚：去年11月间，正当金日成首相访问我国时，朝鲜政府送来了一批甜美的苹果。其中一份送给了邮电部。邮电部的同志把它送给到石景山钢铁公司参加义务劳动的同志。他们经过认真商量，又把它转赠给石景山钢铁工人。工人们觉得这份礼品情深谊重，谁也舍不得吃。于是这些苹果又旅行了几千公里，寄到了福建前线。
    前线部队领导机关接到这份礼品以后，经过慎重考虑，决定把它分给在惩罚敌人的战斗中有重大贡献的海军、炮兵、空军部队和英勇负伤的英雄们。1958年除夕，有五只苹果送到了前线某空军部队，空军同志们经过再三讨论，觉得前线的胜利是党、毛主席的英明领导和人民群众大力支援的结果。他们把这份苹果送到地方党委，分送给了工人和农民。经过工人和农民讨论，认为还是空军战士应该得到这份奖赏。这五只苹果又被送到空军部队。当苹果到了机场，守卫在机翼下、跑道上的战士们，人人争传喜讯，轻轻地摸着这几只不平凡的苹果，可是谁也没有分赏它。他们又把它送给了去年创造全省粮食高产纪录和大面积丰产的一个人民公社。
    公社社员收下苹果，用木盒把它装起来，陈列进公社的“红旗馆”，社员们以十分激动的心情谈论着这几只苹果的来历，决心在今年工农业生产建设中和在支援前线等各方面创造更大成绩。
    现在送到前线海军、炮兵等部队的苹果，还在继续由这一个单位转送到另一个单位。它传到哪里，就给哪里的人们带来伟大的力量。
