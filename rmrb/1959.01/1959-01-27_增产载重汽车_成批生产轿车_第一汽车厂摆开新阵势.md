Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 26th: The First Automobile Works will significantly increase the production of Jiefang (Liberation) brand trucks this year compared to last year, and will begin mass-producing sedans. This will transform the factory from one that produces only one type of vehicle into one that produces multiple types, making a greater contribution to supporting transportation in our country.

Currently, all factory workers are engaged in a mass movement, working diligently to prepare for sedan production and create conditions to achieve a production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift. All workshops are launching crash programs to design and manufacture the necessary tooling and equipment for sedan production, including thousands of pieces of cutting tools, gauges, jigs, and molds. To create conditions for achieving a production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift, the entire factory has rushed to manufacture over 900 pieces of locally-made simple equipment, which are currently undergoing inspection and evaluation. Already, three workshops, ten divisions, and ninety-three groups have implemented over 440 technical measures, achieving the production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift ahead of schedule.

While carrying out the heavy task of production preparation, the workers are also actively organizing the production of Jiefang brand vehicles, based on the supply of raw materials and cooperative products. In early January, the factory also trial-produced the first batch of five-ton Jiefang brand trucks. These trucks have greater horsepower, lower fuel consumption, and a payload that is one ton greater than the currently produced Jiefang brand trucks. After testing and evaluation, these trucks will be formally produced to replace the current four-ton Jiefang brand trucks.

Last year, through a series of mass movements, the First Automobile Works saw a leap forward in production, with vehicle output doubling compared to 1957, and production costs decreasing by nearly a quarter compared to 1957. The vehicles produced last year have already been supplied to over 3,000 units, strengthening the transportation capacity of our vast urban and rural areas. In September and October alone, the factory rushed to manufacture 2,000 vehicles to support the "Marshal of Steel" campaign. Last year, the factory also successfully trial-produced eighteen new products, including fourteen types of automobiles such as "Hongqi" (Red Flag) and "Dongfeng" (East Wind), and four types of engines, taking the first step on the road to becoming a multi-product automobile manufacturing factory. While completing the heavy task of automobile production, the factory also squeezed out over 910,000 work hours last year to produce over 132,000 pieces of cooperative products for nearly 200 units, including forgings and castings weighing several tons, as well as drills as small as screws. In addition, it transferred over 560 cadres and over 1,000 skilled workers to fraternal tractor factories, automobile factories, and 25 other units, and also specially trained 800 producer gas engine operators to support rural construction.

    增产载重汽车  成批生产轿车
    第一汽车厂摆开新阵势
    新华社长春26日电　第一汽车制造厂今年解放牌载重汽车的产量将比去年增加很多，并且要成批生产轿车，把生产单一品种的汽车工厂改变成为生产多品种的汽车工厂，为支援我国交通运输作出更大的贡献。
    目前全厂职工正在大搞群众运动，抓紧进行轿车的生产准备工作，并为实现班产二百五十辆汽车的生产能力创造条件。各车间都在突击设计和制造轿车的工艺装备，包括刀具、量具、夹具、模具等数千件，工作量很大。为实现班产二百五十辆创造条件，全厂已突击制成土简设备九百多台，正在进行验收和鉴定。现在全厂已有三个车间、十个工部、九十三个小组实现了四百四十多项技术措施，提前达到了班产二百五十辆的生产能力。
    在进行繁重的生产准备工作的同时，职工们根据原材料和协作产品的供应情况，正在积极组织解放牌汽车的生产。1月初，这个厂还试制了首批载重五吨的解放牌汽车，这种汽车马力大，耗油量低，载重量比现在生产的解放牌汽车增加一吨。经过试验和鉴定以后，这种汽车将正式生产，代替现在的四吨解放牌汽车。
    第一汽车厂去年经过一系列的群众运动，生产上出现了跃进局面，汽车产量比1957年翻了一番，生产成本比1957年降低将近四分之一。去年生产的汽车已经供应了三千多个单位，增强了我国广大城乡的运输力量。仅在去年9、10月间，为了支援钢铁元帅升帐，就突击制造了二千辆汽车。去年，这个厂还试制成功了十八种新产品，包括“红旗”、“东风”等十四种汽车和四种发动机，在向多品种的汽车生产工厂发展的道路上迈开了第一步。在完成繁重的汽车生产任务的同时，去年这个厂还挤出九十一万多个工时，为近二百个单位生产了十三万二千多件协作产品，其中有几吨重的锻件和铸件，也有小得和螺丝钉相似的鑽头。此外，还向兄弟拖拉机厂、汽车厂等二十五个单位输送了五百六十多名干部、一千多名技术工人，并且专门训练了八百名煤气机手，支援农村建设。
