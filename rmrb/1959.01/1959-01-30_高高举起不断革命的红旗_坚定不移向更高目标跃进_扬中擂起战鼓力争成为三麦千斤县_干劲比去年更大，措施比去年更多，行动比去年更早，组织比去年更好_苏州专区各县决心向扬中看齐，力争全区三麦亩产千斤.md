This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 29th: On the basis of last year's great leap forward in agriculture, Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, is holding high the red banner of continuous revolution, advancing victoriously, and striving to become a county with 1,000 jin of three wheats (wheat, barley, naked barley) this year (last year, the average per-mu yield of three wheats in the county was 251.5 jin). To achieve this goal, the county has mobilized 200,000 people to strengthen field management and has proposed a friendly competition to all counties and cities in the province. Nanjing's "Xinhua Daily" published a special page on January 21 entitled "Learn from Yangzhong and Compete with Yangzhong" for this purpose.

After the sowing of more than 100,000 mu of three wheats last autumn, Yangzhong County immediately launched a blitz campaign to process wheat fields, basically achieving the garden-style management of every plot of three wheats in the county. Recently, after analyzing the current growth of three wheats, the Yangzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to the people of the county: strive to achieve a county with 1,000 jin of three wheats and win the provincial championship for three wheats. The County Committee believes that there are many favorable conditions for achieving a county with 1,000 jin of three wheats this year. First, the "start" of this year's three wheats was well-grasped, comprehensively achieving deep plowing, close planting, and sufficient fertilizer, and the wheat seedlings are growing vigorously, with first-class seedlings accounting for more than 70%; second, the bumper harvest in 1958 prepared a relatively solid material foundation for this year's production, and the cultivation techniques of three wheats have also been greatly improved compared with previous years. Third, after studying the resolution on several issues concerning the people's communes, the people of the county have further liberated their minds, are more enthusiastic, and have a more pragmatic style, especially with the leadership of the Party and the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, this year's three wheats production will inevitably achieve a greater leap forward.

The County Committee's battle call to strive for a county with 1,000 jin of three wheats immediately turned into practical action by cadres and the masses throughout the county, and a new situation emerged in the field management of three wheats. All people's communes have drawn one-third of their labor force to form specialized management teams for three wheats and have established a "three fix and one reward system," so that management personnel, production increase targets, and measures are assigned to the fields and grasped to the end. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the commune members is very high. In early January, during a fight against a cold wave, the county's three wheats professional teams went to the fields overnight to light fires and smoke, and more than 30,000 people on the production front lines of water conservancy, sideline occupations, etc., also urgently invested in the frost prevention battle. Their slogans were: "Men and women, young and old, go to the front line, fight the cold wave to ensure high yield," "To get a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin, every link of measures must be grasped tightly." In addition to nearly 40,000 mu of three wheats in the previous few days being top-dressed with fertilizer, after two days of a concentrated effort, 66,000 mu of three wheats fields were also applied with river mud, and 49 million dan of miscellaneous fertilizer and smoked soil were applied. In the regular management of wheat fields, the people of the county are even more meticulous in processing with the spirit of "managing wheat like embroidery." The action slogan of the members of the Baqiao People's Commune is "Three wheats must resolutely catch up with rice, do everything possible to protect good seedlings, make first-class seedlings jump up, eliminate third-class seedlings, and let millions of strong seedlings survive the winter well." The three wheats seedlings in Twenty Embankment of this commune grew poorly. Production Captain Chen Yuchang and the commune members carried fertilizer to the fields overnight to apply ash and irrigate with manure. Ten days later, the wheat seedlings caught up. Dong Hongda, the manager of the three wheats fields in the neighboring Embankment, was afraid of falling behind and immediately led the commune members to apply fertilizer and remove weeds, wanting to maintain the title of the red flag team for three wheats management. After nearly three months of clever top-dressing, diligent weeding, and reasonable irrigation, the people of the county now have strong seedlings and a lush green color in every wheat field.

Based on the spirit of continuous revolution, the County Committee recently studied the growth law of three wheats in detail and decided to mobilize the masses to overcome "five barriers" (namely, three wheats overwintering, rising, round stem elongation, booting and heading, and maturity) to ensure high yields in every wheat field. The County Committee requires all communes to continue to adhere to putting politics in command, cadres being responsible for areas, using experimental fields to drive basic fields, and constantly checking seedlings to promote growth. At the same time, it is also necessary to further strengthen labor management, vigorously develop specialized management teams, implement the "three fix and one reward system," and fully implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to the growth needs of three wheats, in order to win high yields in every wheat field and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th: The broad masses of commune members in various counties of Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are actively responding to the competitive initiative proposed by Yangzhong County to strive for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of three wheats, and are doing everything possible to strengthen the overwintering management of three wheats (wheat, barley, naked barley), determined to increase the yield per unit area of three wheats in the entire region by more than three times compared with last year, and strive for an average per-mu yield of 1,000 jin.

The goal of striving for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of three wheats was put forward by the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China after analysis and research. The Prefectural Committee believes that there are many favorable conditions for striving for large-scale high yields of three wheats this year. First, the 2.9 million mu of three wheats in the entire region are planted well. All wheat fields were deeply plowed by about one chi, and each mu was sown with 40 to 50 jin of seeds, achieving the selection of fine varieties, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and completing the sowing in a timely manner before the beginning of winter. At the same time, wide ridges and deep ditches were made, which is conducive to preventing waterlogging and draining waterlogging; currently, the growth of three wheats is good. More than 60% of the wheat fields in the entire region generally have more than 800,000 plants per mu, and the small number also have about 400,000 plants. After careful processing and cultivation, the growth of second and third-class seedlings is constantly improving. Judging from the current seedling growth, it has provided a great possibility for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin. As long as we strengthen field management step by step without slackening, this target can be achieved; this year, the people's communes have been realized. After the communes were realized, labor and means of production can be used more rationally and effectively in a unified manner. The leadership experience of cadres and the technical experience of cadres and the masses were also a great harvest in 1958. These situations are better than in 1958 and are more conducive to striving for high yields of three wheats. As long as we further liberate our minds, boost our enthusiasm, and grasp the measures firmly to the end, the target of 1,000 jin can be achieved.

The goals set by the Suzhou Prefectural Committee have been warmly supported by the broad masses of cadres and the masses. Under the slogan of striving to become a prefecture with a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of three wheats, the broad masses of commune members have enthusiastically invested in the field management campaign. People have broken with thousands of years of convention and carried out winter irrigation to promote seedlings for three wheats, and then launched a seedling protection campaign centered on top-dressing fertilizer and preventing frost. The wheat fields in the entire region have generally been top-dressed with fertilizer once, 64% of the wheat fields have been top-dressed twice, and 26% have been top-dressed three times. At the same time, rolling and covering with mud and grass were combined with frost prevention and seedling protection work. At present, more than 90,000 people in the entire region have invested in the fertilizer accumulation campaign to accumulate various fertilizers for top-dressing wheat fields after the spring.

After research, the Suzhou Prefectural Committee proposed the following measures for striving to achieve a prefecture with 1,000 jin: 1. Currently, focus on protecting seedlings and strengthening seedlings. Before the Spring Festival, each mu should be top-dressed with another 150 dan of mud fertilizer, and second and third-class seedlings should be top-dressed with 20 dan of pig and sheep manure and ash fertilizer to eliminate third-class seedlings before the Spring Festival; before the Spring Festival, a comprehensive rolling, soil crushing, soil cultivation, root consolidation, drought resistance, and frost prevention should also be carried out. 2. Immediately launch a mass movement for fertilizer accumulation to prepare enough fertilizer for the needs of top-dressing the wheat seedlings after deep plowing and close planting. It is required that mass fertilizer accumulation and professional team fertilizer accumulation be combined, blitz fertilizer accumulation and regular fertilizer accumulation be combined, and tasks be assigned to households and individuals, with everyone taking action. 3. Vigorously develop indigenous pesticides and indigenous chemical fertilizers, repair agricultural tools as early as possible, prepare for medicine and machinery and various materials, and at the same time vigorously do a good job in opening ditches and draining water, lowering the groundwater level in wheat fields, and striving for the initiative in the fight against scab, stem rust, and drought and flood disasters to ensure the vigorous growth of wheat seedlings. 4. Re-arrange labor, increase the strength of field management and fertilizer accumulation, establish and improve the responsibility system, improve labor organization, implement the three fix and one reward system, and strengthen field management. 5. Mobilize the whole people to deeply study the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, fully discuss the three wheats production plan and measures, further liberate their minds, boost their enthusiasm, so that everyone clearly understands the favorable conditions and possibilities for striving for high yields of three wheats this year, and achieve the goal of firmly establishing targets and firmly implementing measures. 6. The entire region should do a good job in high-yield experimental fields and 900,000 mu of basic fields to promote high yields per mu in a large area and harvest everywhere, organize visits and inspections, carry out appraisals and competitions, and set off a more enthusiastic bumper harvest competition movement than in 1958.

In order to implement these measures, the Prefectural Committee decided that Party committees at all levels should be led by the secretaries to strengthen leadership, and requested that Party committees at all levels take advantage of the momentum of vigorously promoting high yields of three wheats to drive oil crops through the barrier, high yields of green manure and broad beans, and promote a comprehensive leap forward in production.

    高高举起不断革命的红旗　坚定不移向更高目标跃进
    扬中擂起战鼓力争成为三麦千斤县
    干劲比去年更大，措施比去年更多，行动比去年更早，组织比去年更好
    苏州专区各县决心向扬中看齐，力争全区三麦亩产千斤
    本报南京29日电　江苏省扬中县在去年农业大跃进的基础上，高举不断革命的红旗，乘胜前进，力争今年成为三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）千斤县（去年全县三麦平均亩产为二百五十一斤半）。为实现这个目标，全县已出动二十万人加强田间管理，并向全省各县市提出友谊竞赛。南京“新华日报”1月21日为此发表了“向扬中看齐、同扬中竞赛”的专页。
    扬中县在去秋十万多亩三麦播种结束后，立即开展了麦田突击加工运动，使全县块块三麦基本上达到园田化。最近，中共扬中县委在分析了目前三麦生长情况以后，向全县人民提出：力争实现三麦千斤县，夺取全省三麦冠军的号召。县委认为：今年实现三麦千斤县，有许多有利条件，首先，今年的三麦“头”抓得好，全面达到了深翻、密植、足肥，麦苗生长茁壮，一类苗占70％以上；其次，1958年大丰收，给今年的生产准备了比较雄厚的物质基础，同时三麦的耕作技术也比往年大大提高。第三，全县人民学习了关于人民公社若干问题的决议后，思想进一步解放，干劲更足，作风更为踏实，特别是有党的领导和人民公社无比的优越性，今年三麦生产必然会取得更大的跃进。
    县委的力争三麦千斤县的战斗号召，立即变成全县干部、群众的实际行动，三麦田间管理出现了新的局面。各个人民公社，都抽出三分之一的劳动力组成三麦专业管理队，并建立了“三定一奖制”，使管理人、增产指标和措施到田头，一抓到底。所以社员的干劲很大。1月初，在和一次寒流斗争时，全县三麦专业队连夜下田点火熏烟，在水利、副业等生产战线上的三万多人，也紧急地投入防冻战斗，他们的口号是：“男女老少上前线，大战寒流保高产”、“要得亩产破千斤，环环措施都抓紧”。全县除有将近四万亩三麦在前几天追了肥以外，经过两天突击，又在六万六千亩三麦田里施上了河泥，并追施杂肥、熏土四千九百万担。在经常性的麦田管理中，全县人民更以“管麦如绣花”的精神，精细加工。八桥人民公社社员的行动口号是“三麦要坚决赶水稻，千方百计保好苗，叫一类苗跳一跳，叫三类苗消灭掉，让百万壮苗好过冬”。这个社二十圩的三麦苗长得较差，生产队长陈裕昌和社员连夜挑肥下田追灰、浇水粪，十天后，麦苗就赶上来了。邻圩三麦田管理人董洪达，怕掉了队，也立即带动社员追肥、除草，要保持三麦管理红旗队的称号。全县人民，经过近三个月的巧追肥、勤除草和合理灌溉，现在块块麦田苗势茁壮，一片碧绿。
    县委本着不断革命精神，最近又详细研究了三麦生长规律，决定发动群众再闯过“五关”（即三麦越冬、起身、圆秆拔节、孕穗抽穗和成熟），确保块块麦田高产。县委要求各公社继续坚持政治挂帅、干部分片负责、以试验田带动基本田，不断地看苗促进。同时，还要进一步加强劳动管理，大搞专业管理队，推行“三定一奖制”，根据三麦生长需要，全面地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，以赢得三麦块块高产，取得今年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进。
    本报南京29日电　江苏省苏州专区各县的广大社员，积极响应扬中县提出的力争三麦实现亩产千斤的竞赛倡议，正在千方百计地加强三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）越冬管理，决心实现全区三麦单位面积产量比去年增加三倍以上，平均亩产力争一千斤。
    三麦亩产千斤的奋斗目标，是中共苏州地委经过分析研究以后提出来的。地委认为，今年力争三麦大面积高产的有利条件很多。首先，全区二百九十万亩三麦种得好。全部麦田都深翻一尺左右，每亩播种量四十斤到五十斤，做到精选良种，施足基肥，在立冬前适时种完。同时做到了阔垅深沟，有利防涝排渍；目前，三麦生长情况良好，占全部麦田60％以上的麦田，一般每亩都达八十万株以上，少的也有四十万株左右，二、三类苗经过精细加工培植，苗势还在不断好转。从现在的苗势看，已为亩产千斤提供了很大的可能，只要一步不放地加强田间管理，就能实现这个指标；今年已经实现了公社化，公社化以后，劳力和生产资料可以更合理更有效地统一使用，干部的领导经验，干部和群众的技术经验在1958年也是一个大丰收。这些形势比1958年更好，更有利于争取三麦高产，只要进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，把措施始终不懈地一直抓到底，一千斤的指标就可能实现。
    苏州地委提出的奋斗目标，得到了广大干部和群众的热烈拥护。在力争成为三麦亩产千斤专区的口号下，广大社员热火朝天地投入了田间管理运动。人们打破千年常规，对三麦进行冬灌催苗，接着又开展了以追肥防冻为中心的保苗运动，全区麦田普遍追肥一次，64％的麦田追肥两次，26％追肥三次。同时结合进行了镇压和盖泥盖草等防冻保苗工作。目前全区已有九万多人投入了积肥运动，为开春以后麦田追肥积聚各种肥料。
    苏州地委经过研究，对争取实现千斤专区又提出如下措施：一、当前，以保苗、壮苗为中心，在春节前，每亩要再追施泥肥一百五十担，二、三类苗增施猪羊粪和灰肥二十担，把三类苗消灭在春节前；春节前还要全面进行一次镇压碎土、培土、壅根、抗旱防冻。二、立即开展一个全民大搞积肥的运动，为深翻密植以后的麦苗准备足够追肥需要的肥料。要求全民积肥和专业队伍积肥相结合，突击性积肥和经常性积肥相结合，任务到户到人，人人动手。三、大搞土农药和土化肥，及早添修农具，作好药械和各项物资的准备，同时大力搞好开沟排水，降低麦田地下水位，在与赤霉病、秆锈病及旱涝灾害的斗争中，争取主动，保证麦苗生长兴旺。四、重新安排劳力，增加田间管理和积肥方面的力量，建立和健全责任制，改善劳动组织，实行三定一奖制度，加强田间管理。五、发动全民深入学习六中全会决议，充分讨论三麦生产规划和措施，进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，使人人明确今年争取三麦高产的有利条件和可能性，作到指标扎根，措施扎根。六、全区要搞好高产试验田和九十万亩基本田，促使大面积亩亩高产，处处丰收，组织参观检查，开展评比竞赛，掀起一个比1958年更热烈的丰产竞赛运动。
    为了贯彻这些措施，地委决定，各级党委要书记挂帅，加强领导，并要求各级党委乘大搞三麦高产之势，带动油料作物过关，绿肥、蚕豆高产，促进生产全面跃进。（附图片）
