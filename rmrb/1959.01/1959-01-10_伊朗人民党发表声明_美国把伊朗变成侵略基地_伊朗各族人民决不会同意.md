Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 9th. The Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran issued a statement on December 17, 1958, regarding the Iranian-American bilateral military treaty.

The statement said that according to official reports, it is beyond doubt that Iran will sign a military treaty with the United States, a fact that is bound to cause legitimate anxiety among all patriotic strata in Iran. The statement said that, in fact, the painful consequences of Iran's participation in the Baghdad Pact for the past four years have made it clear to everyone what the real purpose of this new military treaty, which is touted as seeming to strengthen national defense, is. It is very clear that this bilateral military treaty with the United States will further turn Iran into a source of war preparation and will establish new bases for imperialist enslavement of Iran. All this will also make the material living conditions of the Iranian people increasingly difficult.

The statement also pointed out that this treaty, which is aimed primarily against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, is also a serious threat to the security and freedom of Middle Eastern countries, especially Iran's close neighbor, the Republic of Iraq.

The statement said that this fact shows that in order to protect the privileges of the big feudal landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie, the Iranian government, in the face of the powerful national liberation movements in the Middle East, does not hesitate to sacrifice Iran's national independence and once again becomes a betrayer of the interests of the Iranian people.

The statement condemned the Iranian government's provocative words and deeds against the people of Arab countries, especially against the people of Iraq. The statement said that these words and deeds of the Iranian government, as well as the concentration of military forces supported by the US naval and air mobile forces in the Persian Gulf on the Iraqi border, clearly demonstrate the aggressive plans of US imperialism. And the military treaty imposed on the Iranian people is one of the means to realize these plans.

The statement said that the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran denounced this treaty before the Iranian people and world public opinion, considering it a treaty that seriously betrays national interests and a means of enslaving Iran and dragging it into the imperialist whirlpool of war preparation. At the same time, the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran expressed its anger at the provocative and aggressive actions of the reactionary Iranian government in colluding with US and British imperialists to threaten the tranquility and freedom of the fraternal neighboring Iraqi people.

The statement finally called on all Iranian patriots to do everything in their power to prevent the parliament from ratifying this treaty and to prevent imperialism and the Iranian government from implementing their aggressive plans against the young Republic of Iraq, which is deeply sympathized with by the Iranian people. The statement said that the people of all ethnic groups in Iran who love independence and freedom will never agree to aggressive actions aimed at opposing the independence and freedom of other peoples.

The statement also called on the Iranian army to refuse to play the despicable role of gendarme serving the interests of imperialism.

    伊朗人民党发表声明
    美国把伊朗变成侵略基地
    伊朗各族人民决不会同意
    新华社9日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗人民党中央委员会在1958年12月17日就伊朗同美国签订双边军事条约问题发表声明。
    声明说，根据官方报道，伊朗将同美国签订军事条约已经无容置疑，这一事实势必引起伊朗各爱国阶层正当的不安。声明说，事实上，伊朗参加巴格达条约四年来的惨痛后果，已经使每个人都能清楚地看出这项被吹嘘为似乎旨在加强国防实力的新的军事条约的真正目的。非常明显，同美国签订的这个双边军事条约将进一步把伊朗变为备战的策源地，并且将建立帝国主义奴役伊朗的新的基地。这一切也将使伊朗人民的物质生活状况变得日益困难。
    声明同时指出，这个旨在首先反对苏联和社会主义阵营各国的条约，也是对中东各国，特别是伊朗的近邻——伊拉克共和国的安全和自由的严重威胁。
    声明说，这一事实表明，伊朗政府为了保护大封建地主阶级和买办资产阶级的特权，在中东各国的强大的民族解放运动面前，不惜牺牲伊朗的民族独立，再次成为伊朗人民利益的出卖者。
    声明谴责伊朗政府反对阿拉伯各国人民，特别是反对伊拉克人民的挑衅性言行。声明说，伊朗政府的这些言行以及受美国在波斯湾的海空军机动部队支持的军事力量在伊拉克边境的集结，都明显地表明了美帝国主义的侵略计划。而强加在伊朗人民身上的军事条约就是实现这些计划的手段之一。
    声明说，伊朗人民党中央委员会在伊朗人民和世界舆论面前痛斥这个条约，认为它是严重地出卖国家利益的条约，是奴役伊朗并且把它拖进帝国主义备战漩涡中去的手段。伊朗人民党中央委员会同时对伊朗反动政府勾结美英帝国主义者威胁伊朗的兄弟邻邦伊拉克人民的安宁和自由的挑衅侵略行为表示愤怒。
    声明最后号召全体伊朗爱国者竭尽全力阻止议会批准这个条约，阻止帝国主义和伊朗政府实现它们反对深受伊朗人民同情的年青的伊拉克共和国的侵略计划。声明说，热爱独立和自由的伊朗各族人民，决不会同意旨在反对别国人民独立和自由的侵略行为。
    声明并且号召伊朗军队拒绝充当为帝国主义利益服务的卑鄙的宪兵角色。
