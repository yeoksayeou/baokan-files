    Raise More Fat Pigs to Sell to the State
    Song Changsheng, Head of the Shimensong People's Commune, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province
    In the past year, our commune, like other communes across the country, has made great leaps forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In particular, there has been even greater development in the pig-raising industry. Originally, our Shimensong Agricultural Cooperative had some foundation in pig raising. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the criticism of right-leaning conservative thought, and the establishment of the People's Commune, with more people and greater strength, the pig-raising industry developed rapidly. By late November of last year, our commune had raised more than 427,000 pigs, an average of 9.5 pigs per person, a fifteen-fold increase compared to 1957. In 1958, we sold more than 60,000 pigs to the state and about 90,000 piglets to brother communes. Recently, in order to support the supply of non-staple foods to cities, we sold more than 4,000 pigs to the state in one go.
    1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle, and we must continue to make even greater leaps forward. The number of pigs raised will increase several times compared to 1958, and we must improve the quality of breeding and raise more fat pigs. In 1959, we plan to sell more than 200,000 pigs to the state, and also increase the number of piglets sold to brother communes.
    In order to realize the 1959 leap forward plan for pig production, we must first expand the construction of pig farms. This year, we plan to expand and build more than 300 pig farms, including more than 150 new ones, and ensure that sows and fat pigs have their own pens. The second is to focus on the basic pig herds and carry out the "four comprehensive" movement. In the past, due to the small number of basic pig herds, pig breeding was very slow. Last year we learned this lesson and focused on the basic pig herds. This year, we will continue to select and cultivate sufficient breeding boars and sows, and carry out the "four comprehensive" movement of comprehensive mating, comprehensive accuracy, comprehensive production, and comprehensive survival to improve the breeding rate. The third is to promote superior varieties. At present, our commune has established a breeding farm, and has promoted superior varieties from other places and local areas such as "Yorkshire", "Yanggu No. 1", and "Lotus Head". This year, we require that the vast majority of pigs be superior varieties. In addition, we must also focus on feed. This year, we plan to plant more than 2,000 mu of alfalfa, more than 2,000 mu of pumpkins and carrots, and also plant more than 10,000 fruit trees to feed pigs with leaves, which are the best feed.
    In addition to the above measures, I believe that we must continue to adhere to putting politics in command and strengthen the leadership of the Party. At present, the Commune Party Committee has designated a member of the Standing Committee to be fully responsible for pig raising. Among the more than 2,800 feeding and management personnel, there are more than 1,000 Party and League members. This year, we will continue to transfer a group of Party and League members to the pig farms, and establish Party and League branches at the farm level in order to play a core leadership role.
    At the beginning of this new year, we are full of confidence in completing this year's leap forward plan, producing more pigs, supporting national construction, and meeting the needs of everyone's life.

### 多养肥猪卖给国家

    多养肥猪卖给国家
    山东寿张县石门宋人民公社社长　宋长生
    在过去的一年中，我们公社和全国其他公社一样，农林牧副渔各方面都有很大的跃进，特别是在养猪事业上有了更大的发展。原来我们石门宋农业社，在养猪方面就有些基础。经过1958年的大跃进，批判了右倾保守思想，又成立了人民公社，人多力量大，养猪事业就有了飞快的发展。到去年11月下旬，我们公社饲养的生猪已达到四十二万七千多头，平均每人有九头半，比1957年翻了十五番。1958年我们卖给国家的生猪达六万多头，卖给兄弟社的子猪约九万多头。最近为了支援城市的副食品供应，一次就卖给国家四千多头生猪。
    1959年是苦战三年有决定意义的一年，我们还要继续作更大的跃进。养的生猪将比1958年有成倍的增长，并且要提高饲养质量，多多培育肥猪。1959年我们计划要卖给国家生猪二十多万头，卖给兄弟社的子猪也要增加。
    为了实现1959年生猪生产的跃进计划，我们首先要扩大养猪场的建设。今年准备扩建和新建养猪场三百多个，其中新建的有一百五十多个，并做到母猪、肥猪都有圈。其次是大抓基本猪群，开展“四全”运动。过去由于基本猪群少，使得生猪繁殖很慢。去年我们接受了这个教训，就大抓基本猪群。今年我们要继续选留培育足够的种公母猪，并开展全配、全准、全产、全活的“四全”运动，提高繁殖率。再次是推广优良品种。目前，我们公社已建立了良种繁殖场，已推广的有“约克夏”、“阳谷一号”、
  “莲花头”等外地和本地的优良品种。在今年内要求绝大部分生猪都是优良品种。此外，我们还要大抓饲料。今年计划要种两千多亩苜蓿，两千多亩南瓜、胡萝卜，还要栽一万多棵果木树，用树叶喂猪，这些都是最好的饲料。
    除以上的一些措施以外，我认为还必须继续坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导。目前公社党委确定一名常委专职掌管养猪工作。在二千八百多名饲养管理人员中，党、团员有一千多人。今年内我们还要继续抽调一批党、团员到养猪场去，并以场为单位建立党、团支部，以便发挥核心领导作用。
    在这新年的开头，我们满有信心完成今年的跃进计划，生产更多的生猪，支援国家建设，满足大伙儿生活上的需要。
