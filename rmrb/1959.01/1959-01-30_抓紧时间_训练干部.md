　　Seize the Time to Train Cadres
　　In the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of 1958, the broad masses of rural cadres, following the direction pointed out by the Party, bravely advanced, completed their tasks, and achieved unprecedented great victories. However, during the Great Leap Forward, the work tasks were very urgent, and a series of new problems could not be studied in depth and discussed in detail in time; many experiences explored and created in complex struggles need to be further summarized, improved, and promoted. At the beginning of the greater leap forward in 1959, some places adopted the method of universally training grassroots cadres without leaving their posts, so that the cadre ranks would not be divorced from the leadership of the current leap forward work on the one hand, and could receive appropriate study and improvement on the other hand, which is a very good method.
　　There are many aspects for cadres to study, including studying the Party's policies, studying leadership methods, and studying cultural and scientific knowledge. In a short-term training, it is obviously impossible to focus on everything. At present, the first thing to solve is to enable every grassroots cadre to have a relatively deep understanding of the Party's policies. Because the deeper the understanding of the Party's policies, the fewer the deviations in work. The second is to learn some good leadership methods. If the leadership method is correct, the work will not be so difficult. For example, if you learn to mobilize the masses, the work will be easily carried out in an all-round way; if you learn to engage in experimental fields, the work will be more practical. As for the study of cultural and scientific knowledge, you can first learn something directly related to production, and other general cultural and scientific knowledge should be solved in a longer period of study in the future.
　　Seizing the time to train cadres is an important preparatory work for striving for a greater leap forward. The experience of Chongren County in Jiangxi Province is worthy of attention.

    抓紧时间　训练干部
    广大农村干部在1958年的全面大跃进中，遵循着党指出的方向，奋勇前进，完成了任务，取得了空前伟大的胜利。但是在大跃进中，工作任务很紧迫，一系列的新问题没有来得及作深入的研究和详尽的讨论；在复杂的斗争中摸索创造出的很多经验，有待进一步总结提高，并加以推广。在开始1959年更大跃进的时候，有的地方采取不离职的普遍训练基层干部的办法，使干部队伍一方面不脱离当前跃进工作的领导，一方面又能得到适当的学习和提高，这是一种很好的办法。
    干部要学习的方面很多，学习党的政策，学习领导工作方法，学习文化科学知识。在一个短期训练里面，显然不可能样样都作为重点，目前首先要解决的是要使每一个基层干部对党的政策有比较深刻的理解。因为对党的政策理解得越深，工作的偏差就会越少。其次是要学习一些好的领导方法，领导方法对头，工作就不那么吃力。比如学会了发动群众，工作就容易全面展开；学会了搞试验田，工作就会更切实。至于文化科学知识的学习，可以先学一些与生产直接有关的东西，其他一般文化科学知识要放在以后较长时期的学习中去解决。
    抓紧时间训练干部，是争取更大跃进的一项重要的准备工作，江西省崇仁县的经验是值得重视的。
