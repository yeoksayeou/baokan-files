Southeastern Shanxi Utilizes Water Conservancy Projects to Open Alpine Navigation
Taihang Mountains Adorned with White Sails
(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 9th dispatch) The people of the southeastern Shanxi Special District in the Taihang Mountains have recently utilized larger reservoirs and canals to open alpine navigation. At present, the alpine routes, composed of five reservoirs and canals including the Jianghe, Zhongcun, and Yueling Mountain, stretching over a hundred li, have been put into busy winter transport. Farmers are using this song to praise the victory of alpine navigation: "It is rare for people to live to a hundred years old, an ancient and modern marvel; the miracle of Taihang spreads throughout the world: since ancient times, boats have not been seen on high mountains, but now ships sail through Taihang. A happy life increases day by day, a beautiful socialist scene unfolds; go all out and work hard, the mountain areas will surely transform into Jiangnan."

The southeastern Shanxi Special District has many mountains, the roads are rugged, and transportation is very inconvenient. In addition, there is a lack of water sources, and the rivers in the mountainous areas cannot be well utilized, which has increased the difficulties in accelerating socialist construction in the mountainous areas and connecting urban and rural material exchanges. In 1958, under the slogan of "Ask water for labor, ask water for happiness," the people of the whole region launched a water conservancy construction movement. They split mountains and cut ridges, building more than 20,000 water conservancy projects to bring water to the mountains, irrigating four million mu of dry mountain slopes and terraces. They also connected the larger reservoirs and canals that had been built, established their own factories to manufacture wooden boats, and opened alpine water transport.

Since the opening of alpine navigation, it has played a good role in connecting urban and rural material exchanges and accelerating the construction of mountainous areas. Zhangdian, Baquan, and other remote mountain villages in the upper reaches of the Zhang River, in the former Tunliu County, were unable to transport large quantities of abundant pears, fennel, mountain products, and other local specialties due to inconvenient transportation in the past, and it was not easy to transport industrial products in. In August of last year, after the Jianghe Reservoir was completed, with the joint efforts of the reservoir administration and the local people's commune, six large wooden boats capable of carrying five to ten tons were manufactured, and a new waterway nearly thirty li long from Dianshang to Zhangbamiao was opened, ensuring smooth flow of goods. According to statistics from the steel production campaign and the two months of November and December alone, the volume of water transport reached more than 4,000 tons. Zhongcun and Zhangcun and other places in the western part of the former Tunliu County are mountainous areas lacking coal and firewood. To burn a load of coal, people had to climb mountains and ridges to the Huangnian Coal Mine, more than a hundred li away, to transport it. After the Jianghe Reservoir opened to navigation, the waterway was connected to the Tunliu-Changzhi highway, and by using trucks and wooden boats, a large amount of coal could be transported into the mountain villages in just over five hours.

In order to further develop alpine navigation and tap the potential of water transport, the CPC Southeastern Shanxi Prefectural Committee and the Southeastern Shanxi Administrative Office summarized the experiences of various places in utilizing water conservancy projects to open alpine navigation, and sent water conservancy technicians to conduct surveys and planning on the three major rivers of the region, the Qin, Zhang, and Dan. According to the principle of unified planning, comprehensive development, and comprehensive utilization, a plan for developing alpine navigation was formulated. In addition to the projects that are already navigable, it is planned to use the 41 major water conservancy projects newly built this year to open 13 new routes, covering more than 200 li, and deploy more than 150 wooden boats. Furthermore, small and short routes will be gradually connected into large routes, forming a high-altitude navigation network and realizing high-altitude navigation.

### 晋东南利用水利工程开辟高山航运  太行山上扬白帆

    晋东南利用水利工程开辟高山航运
    太行山上扬白帆
    本报太原9日电　太行山区的山西省晋东南专区的人民，最近利用较大的水库、渠道，开辟了高山航运。目前，由绛河、中村、月岭山等五处水库和河渠组成的长达一百多华里的高山航线，已经投入繁忙的冬季运输。农民们用这样一首歌谣颂扬高山通航的胜利：人活百岁古今罕，太行奇迹天下传：自古高山不见舟，如今太行通了船。幸福生活日日增，社会主义美景展；鼓足干劲加油干，山区定能变江南。
    晋东南专区山多，道路崎岖，交通很不方便，加以水源缺少，山区的河不能很好利用，这都为加速山区社会主义建设，沟通城乡物资交流增加了困难。1958年，全区人民在“向水要劳力，向水要幸福”的口号下，开展了水利建设运动。他们劈山削岭，修筑了两万多件引水上山的水利工程，使四百万亩干旱的山坡地和梯田得到灌溉。他们还把修筑好的较大的水库、渠道互相连接起来，自办工厂制造木船，开辟了高山水上航运。
    高山航运通航以后，已经对沟通城乡物资交流，加速山区建设起了良好的作用。位于漳河上游原屯留县的张店、八泉等偏僻山村，过去因交通不便，丰富的梨果、茴香、山货等土特产品不能大量外运，工业品也不容易运进去。去年8月间，绛河水库建成之后，在水库管理局和当地人民公社共同努力下，制造了能载重五到十吨的大木船六艘，新开辟了从店上到丈八庙近三十里的水上航运，作到了物货畅流。仅据去年在大战钢铁期间和11月、12月两个月的统计，水上运输量达四千多吨。原屯留县西部的中村、张村等地，是个缺煤缺柴的山区，烧一担煤，人们要攀山越岭，到一百多里以外的黄碾煤矿去运。绛河水库开航以后，水路同屯（留）长（治）公路连接起来，汽车拉，木船运，只要五个多小时，就可以把大量的煤炭运进山村。
    为了进一步发展高山航运，挖掘水上运输潜力，中共晋东南地委和晋东南专署，总结了各地利用水利工程开辟高山航运的经验，派出水利技术人员对全区沁、漳、丹三大河流进行了勘察和规划。根据统一规划、全面开发、综合利用的方针，制定了发展高山航运的计划。除现在已经通航的工程以外，计划利用今年新建的四十一项主要水利工程，再新开辟十三条航线，行程二百多里，投放木船一百五十多艘。并且要逐步把小航线、短航线逐步连成大航线，形成高山航运网，实现高山航运化。
