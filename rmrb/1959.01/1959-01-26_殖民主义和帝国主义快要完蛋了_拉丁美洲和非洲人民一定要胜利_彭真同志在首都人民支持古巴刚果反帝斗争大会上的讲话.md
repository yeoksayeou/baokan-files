Comrades, friends:

Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a rally here to support the just struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialist intervention and the just struggle of the Congolese people against colonialist oppression. The national democratic revolutionary movement of the Cuban people has achieved a major victory; now they are continuing their heroic struggle against the intervention of U.S. imperialism. The Congolese people have recently launched a national liberation struggle against Belgian colonial rule and the Belgian colonialists' policy of massacre. The vigorous development of the anti-imperialist struggles in Cuba and the Congo shows that the great national revolutionary movement is rising further. The struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people are the common struggle of the people of Latin America and Africa, and also the common struggle of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world against colonialism and aggression. We, the entire Chinese people, firmly support the national democratic revolutionary movement of the Cuban people and resolutely support the struggle of the Congolese people for freedom and independence. We firmly oppose U.S. imperialist interference in Cuba's internal affairs and resolutely oppose the Belgian colonialists' massacre of the Congolese people. Colonialism and imperialism are dying out. No matter how they struggle, the Cuban people are bound to win, the Congolese people are bound to win, and the people of Latin America and Africa are bound to win.

The entire Chinese people warmly celebrate the great victory of the Cuban people. For many years, the Cuban people have waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the oppression and plunder of U.S. imperialism and against the Batista traitorous dictatorial regime. Two years ago, under the leadership of Castro, the Cuban people resolutely launched an armed uprising. Despite the Batista regime's frantic suppression and various sabotage schemes with the support of U.S. imperialism, the Cuban people, who persisted in the struggle, finally achieved victory on New Year's Day this year, and the U.S. imperialist lackey Batista regime finally collapsed. This is a great victory for the Cuban people's anti-aggression and anti-dictatorship struggle, and also a serious defeat for U.S. imperialism in Latin America. The victory of the Cuban people is a great encouragement not only to the national revolutionary movement in Latin America, but also to the national revolutionary movements in Asia and Africa. We extend our warm congratulations to the victorious Cuban people!

However, the U.S. imperialists, who are aggressive by nature, are by no means willing to accept defeat. They are threatening the Cuban people, doing everything possible to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, harboring Cuban counter-revolutionaries, preventing the Cuban people from punishing counter-revolutionary criminals, and attempting to make a comeback in Cuba. This arrogant interference by the U.S. imperialists has aroused boundless anger among the Cuban people. On the 21st of this month, a million-strong anti-U.S. demonstration was held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, which powerfully countered the provocations of U.S. imperialism. The Cuban people have stood up. We believe that the Cuban people, relying on their own unity and struggle, and with the support of the people of the entire Americas and the world, will surely be able to defeat the U.S. imperialist conspiracies of interference and aggression.

Now, Latin America is no longer the "backyard" for U.S. imperialism to manipulate at will. The 200 million Latin American people have awakened, and their anger at the American aggressors has developed to an unstoppable degree. In recent years, in many countries in Latin America, the traitorous dictatorial regimes fostered by U.S. imperialism have collapsed one after another. U.S. imperialism is still taking various despicable measures in an attempt to change this situation unfavorable to them and maintain and strengthen its control over Latin American countries. However, this cannot save them from their shameful defeat. The victory of the Cuban people once again proves that the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin America is irresistible. The era of U.S. imperialists running rampant in Latin America is coming to an end.

The entire Chinese people resolutely support the Congolese people's heroic struggle against colonialism and for national independence. For eighty years, the Congo has suffered extremely cruel plunder and oppression by Belgian colonialists. The Belgian colonialists and other imperialist countries have used the blood and sweat of the Congolese people and the African people as an important source of their wealth. The people of the Congo and Africa have long groaned under the heavy shackles of the imperialist colonial system, living an extremely miserable life. However, the sleeping African continent has finally awakened. The Congo, which the Belgian colonialists called an "oasis of stability," recently saw the outbreak of a heroic mass struggle for freedom and independence. Now, the Belgian colonial rulers, with the support of U.S. imperialism, are carrying out bloody suppression and hypocritical deception against the Congolese people. However, the Congolese people's firm will to fight for freedom and independence is unshakable. We resolutely support the Congolese people's struggle for freedom and independence. We resolutely oppose the Belgian colonial rulers' massacre of the Congolese people. The Congolese people's struggle is by no means isolated. We firmly believe that the Congolese people, who persist in the struggle, will surely achieve final victory.

Now, the whole of Africa has been set in motion. From Cairo to Accra, from Tangier to the Cape of Good Hope, for the imperialist colonial rulers, everywhere is a volcano, some have already erupted, and some are about to erupt. The Algerian people are waging a heroic and victorious armed struggle. Guinea has declared its independence. Of the 220 million people in Africa, nearly half have already achieved independent status. The people in colonies and dependencies that have not yet achieved independence, such as Cameroon, Togo, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria, Madagascar, etc., are also fighting against imperialism in various forms. There is no doubt that the Congolese people's heroic struggle will greatly encourage the struggle of the African people and promote the further development of the African national independence movement.

Comrades, friends! The struggle of the Cuban people and the struggle of the Congolese people are a major development in the current national revolutionary movement. The national revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising higher and higher. Of course, imperialism and colonialism will never automatically withdraw from the stage of history. They are and will continue to suppress, deceive, and sabotage the national revolutionary movement. They are especially afraid of the support of the powerful socialist camp for the national independence movement and the unity of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Therefore, they are doing their utmost to sow discord between socialist countries and countries striving for and maintaining national independence, and to undermine the unity between countries striving for and maintaining national independence and the unity within these countries. On the road to the complete victory of the national revolution, the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries will still encounter many difficulties and setbacks. However, we firmly believe that the awakened people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with the support of justice-upholding countries and working people all over the world, will surely be able to unite, persist in the struggle, and overcome all kinds of obstacles on the road forward, completely smash the oppression and conspiracies of imperialism, and achieve final victory.

The national revolutionary movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has become an irresistible historical trend. The imperialist colonial system has crumbled. For more than a hundred years, imperialists have always boasted of being "advanced" and "civilized," and that they are the "direction of mankind." However, these are just deceptive lies. Imperialism relies mainly on the exploitation and plunder of its own people and the people of the colonies for its survival and development. Now, due to the growth of the socialist camp and the rise of the national liberation movement, the imperialist system has been fundamentally shaken, and the myth of "Western civilization" has gone bankrupt. The broad masses of the people have understood that although the imperialists were once mighty and are still flaunting their power in many places, their good days are over. The national liberation movement against imperialism is supported by the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and by the working class and all the working people in capitalist countries. All the obstruction and struggles of imperialism cannot save it from its final defeat. Imperialism is a decadent and doomed thing. Socialism and the national revolutionary movement are the new and advancing forces. The day of ending colonialist and imperialist rule is not far away. The national revolutionary movement of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will surely achieve complete victory. The just struggle of the people of the world against imperialism will surely achieve final victory.

Now, U.S. imperialism still occupies our Taiwan. The 650 million people of our People's Republic of China stand on the same front with all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for independence and freedom. Their enemies are also our enemies, and their struggles are also our struggles. In this common struggle against imperialism, we will always be united, and final victory will surely belong to us.

Let us shout:

Celebrate the new victory in the anti-colonialist struggle!
Support the Cuban national democratic revolutionary movement!
Support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence!
Down with the imperialist colonial system!
Oppose U.S. imperialist interference in Cuba's internal affairs!
Oppose the Belgian colonial authorities' massacre of the Congolese people!
Belgian colonialists, get out of the Congo!
Imperialists, get out of Latin America!
Imperialists, get out of Africa!
Imperialists, get out of Asia

    殖民主义和帝国主义快要完蛋了
    拉丁美洲和非洲人民一定要胜利
    彭真同志在首都人民支持古巴刚果反帝斗争大会上的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民，在这里举行大会，支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉的正义斗争，支持刚果人民反对殖民主义压迫的正义斗争。古巴人民的民族民主革命运动，已经取得重大的胜利；现在，他们正在为反对美帝国主义的干涉，继续进行英勇的斗争。刚果人民，最近也掀起了反对比利时殖民统治和反抗比利时殖民者屠杀政策的民族解放斗争。古巴、刚果反帝斗争的蓬勃开展，显示着伟大的民族革命运动正在进一步高涨。古巴人民和刚果人民的斗争，是拉丁美洲和非洲人民的共同斗争，也是全世界一切爱好和平和自由、反对殖民主义和侵略的人民的共同斗争。我们全中国人民，坚决支持古巴人民的民族民主革命运动，坚决支持刚果人民争取自由和独立的斗争。我们坚决反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政，坚决反对比利时殖民主义者屠杀刚果人民。殖民主义和帝国主义快要完蛋了，不管他们怎样挣扎，古巴人民是一定要胜利的，刚果人民是一定要胜利的，拉丁美洲和非洲人民是一定要胜利的。
    全中国人民热烈欢呼古巴人民的伟大胜利。许多年来，古巴人民为了反对美帝国主义的压迫和掠夺，反对巴蒂斯塔卖国独裁政权，进行了英勇顽强的斗争。两年以前，古巴人民在卡斯特罗的领导下，毅然决然地举行了武装起义。尽管巴蒂斯塔政权在美帝国主义的支持下，进行了疯狂的镇压和各种阴谋破坏，坚持斗争的古巴人民终于在今年元旦取得了胜利，美帝国主义的走狗巴蒂斯塔政权，终于垮台了。这是古巴人民反侵略、反独裁斗争的巨大胜利，也是美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的一个严重失败。古巴人民的胜利，不但是对拉丁美洲民族革命运动，而且是对亚洲、非洲民族革命运动的一个很大的鼓舞。我们向胜利的古巴人民表示热烈的祝贺！
    但是，侵略成性的美帝国主义者，是决不甘心失败的。它正在威胁古巴人民，千方百计地干涉古巴内政，包庇古巴反革命分子，阻止古巴人民惩办反革命罪犯，企图在古巴卷土重来。美帝国主义者这种横暴的干涉，激起了古巴人民无比的愤怒。本月21日，在古巴首都哈瓦那，举行了一百万人的反美大示威，有力地回击了美帝国主义的挑衅。古巴人民已经站起来了。我们相信，古巴人民依靠自己的团结和斗争，在全美洲和全世界人民的支持之下，一定能够战胜美帝国主义的干涉和侵略的阴谋。
    现在，拉丁美洲已经不再是美帝国主义任意摆布的“后院”了。两亿拉丁美洲人民已经觉醒起来，他们对美国侵略者的愤怒已经发展到不可遏止的程度。近几年来，在拉丁美洲许多国家中，美帝国主义扶植起来的卖国独裁政权，接二连三地垮了台。美帝国主义还在采取各种卑鄙的手段，企图改变这种对他们不利的形势，保持和加强对于拉丁美洲国家的控制。但是，这并不能挽救他们的可耻的失败的命运。古巴人民的胜利，又一次证明了拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，是不可阻挡的。美帝国主义者在拉丁美洲横行霸道的时代，已经接近末日了。
    全中国人民坚决支持刚果人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的英勇斗争。八十年来，刚果遭受着比利时殖民主义者极端残酷的掠夺和压迫。比利时殖民主义者和其他帝国主义国家，把刚果人民和非洲人民的血汗作为他们发财致富的重要来源，刚果和非洲的人民，长期呻吟在帝国主义殖民制度的重重枷锁之下，过着极其悲惨的生活。但是，沉睡的非洲大陆终于觉醒了。被比利时殖民主义者叫做“安定的绿洲”的刚果，在不久以前爆发了争取自由和独立的英勇的群众斗争。现在，比利时的殖民统治者，在美帝国主义的支持下，正在对刚果人民进行血腥的镇压和伪善的欺骗。但是，刚果人民争取自由和独立的坚强意志，是不可动摇的。我们坚决支持刚果人民争取自由和独立的斗争。我们坚决反对比利时殖民统治者屠杀刚果人民。刚果人民的斗争，决不是孤立的。我们深信，坚持斗争的刚果人民一定会取得最后胜利。
    现在，整个非洲已经动起来了。从开罗到阿克拉，从丹吉尔到好望角，对于帝国主义殖民统治者说来，到处都是火山，有的已经爆发，有的将要爆发。阿尔及利亚人民正在英勇地、胜利地进行着武装斗争。几内亚已经宣布了独立。非洲二亿二千万人口中，已经有将近一半取得了独立的地位。还没有取得独立的殖民地和附属国，像喀麦隆、多哥、怯尼亚、莫三鼻给、乌干达、尼日利亚、马达加斯加等地区的人民，也在通过各种形式，对帝国主义进行着斗争，毫无疑问，刚果人民的英勇斗争，一定会大大鼓舞非洲人民的斗争，推动非洲民族独立运动的进一步发展。
    同志们，朋友们！古巴人民和刚果人民的斗争，是当前民族革命运动的一个重大发展。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族革命运动，越来越高涨了。当然，帝国主义和殖民主义决不会自动退出历史舞台。他们正在而且必将继续对民族革命运动进行镇压、欺骗和破坏。他们尤其害怕强大的社会主义阵营对于民族独立运动的支持以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的团结，因此，他们竭力挑拨社会主义国家同争取和维护民族独立的国家之间的关系，竭力破坏争取和维护民族独立的国家之间的团结和这些国家内部的团结。在争取民族革命彻底胜利的道路上，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民还会遇到许多困难和曲折。但是，我们深信，觉悟了的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民，在强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持下，在全世界主持正义的国家和劳动人民的支持下，一定能够团结起来，坚持斗争，一定能够克服前进道路上的各种障碍，彻底粉碎帝国主义的压迫和阴谋，取得最后的胜利。
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族革命运动，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。帝国主义的殖民体系，已经土崩瓦解。一百多年来，帝国主义者总是吹嘘他“先进”、“文明”，吹嘘他们是“人类的方向”。但是，这不过是骗人的鬼话。帝国主义所赖以生存和发展的，主要依靠对本国人民和殖民地人民的剥削和掠夺。现在，由于社会主义阵营的壮大，民族解放运动的兴起，帝国主义制度已经根本动摇了，“西方文明”的神话已经破产了。广大的人民已经懂得，帝国主义者虽然曾经耀武扬威，而且现在在不少地方还在耀武扬威，但是，他们的好日子已经过去了。反对帝国主义的民族解放运动，受到以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的支持，受到资本主义国家工人阶级和全体劳动人民的支持。帝国主义的一切阻挠和挣扎，并不能挽救自己最后的失败。帝国主义是腐朽的、注定灭亡的东西。社会主义和民族革命运动，才是新生的、前进的力量。结束殖民主义和帝国主义统治的日子已经不远了。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族革命运动，一定会取得彻底的胜利。全世界人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。
    现在，美帝国主义还霸占着我们的台湾。我们中华人民共和国的六亿五千万人民，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切争取独立自由的人民，是站在一条战线上的。他们的敌人也就是我们的敌人，他们的斗争也就是我们的斗争。在这个对帝国主义的共同斗争中，我们将永远团结在一起，最后胜利必将属于我们。
    让我们高呼：
    庆祝反殖民主义斗争的新胜利！
    支持古巴民族民主革命运动！
    支持刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争！
    打倒帝国主义殖民制度！
    反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政！
    反对比利时殖民当局屠杀刚果人民！
    比利时殖民主义者从刚果滚出去！
    帝国主义者从拉丁美洲滚出去！
    帝国主义者从非洲滚出去！
    帝国主义者从亚洲滚出去！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结起来！
    民族解放运动胜利万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
