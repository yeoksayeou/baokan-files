Produce More Tea, Produce More Jute
Xihu and Yipeng Communes Actively Respond to the Call

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Xihu People's Commune in Hangzhou, the origin of the famous "Dragon Well" tea, and the Yipeng Commune, a jute-producing area, are taking practical actions to respond to the ten initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Socialist Construction Units.
    Last year, the Xihu People's Commune's more than 3,500 mu of tea gardens had an estimated average yield of 187 jin per mu, with both output and quality higher than in 1957.
    After studying and discussing the ten initiatives, the Xihu People's Commune Party Committee has initially determined that in 1959, the yield of tea per mu will strive to reach 400 jin, and at the same time, more high-grade tea should be produced. In order to achieve this leap forward target, the commune has already begun to take a series of measures to increase production. An important aspect is the management of the tea gardens. The density of the tea bushes has increased. In the past, there were about 300 bushes per mu, but now many tea gardens have been transplanted, generally increasing to more than 400 bushes per mu, and some high-yield experimental tea gardens have increased to more than 500 bushes. Each brigade has organized tea farmers with skilled transplanting techniques to carry out this work. It is estimated that this work can be completed by the summer of this year.
    "Feeding and clothing" the tea bushes well, so that the tea trees can safely overwinter, is another concrete action taken by commune members to respond to the ten initiatives. Currently, commune members are applying fertilizer and covering the tea gardens with rice straw.
    When the ten initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Socialist Construction Units were conveyed to the Yipeng People's Commune in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, a famous jute-producing area in our country, the commune Party Committee was holding an enlarged meeting. At the meeting, the initiatives were read and discussed item by item, and everyone eagerly spoke, proposing targets and measures, expressing their firm response to the ten initiatives. Now, the production teams of the commune are universally carrying out activities to publicize and discuss the ten initiatives. Commune cadres want to take responding to the ten initiatives as a driving force to promote current production.
    The Yipeng Commune mainly grows jute. In 1958, this commune created the highest record for jute yield per unit area in Zhejiang Province, and at the same time, both cotton and hemp achieved large-scale high yields. In this expanded meeting of the Party Committee, in discussing the ten initiatives, the focus was on discussing the greater development of cotton and hemp production. According to the spirit of the initiatives, everyone revised this year's production targets, initially determining that the commune's jute planting area should increase from more than 52,000 mu last year to more than 60,000 mu, requiring an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu; and 25% of the high-yield fields are required to yield 4,000 jin per mu. In order to realize this leap forward plan, everyone proposed that if there are ten parts of targets, there must be twelve parts of measures, and decided to first engage in fertilizer and water conservancy in a big way, and carry out a movement to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, striving to increase the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton and hemp by more than double this year compared to last year.

    多产茶叶多产黄麻
    西湖、义蓬公社积极响应号召
    据新华社讯  名茶“龙井”产地的杭州西湖人民公社和黄麻产地的义蓬公社正以实际行动，来响应全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议。
    去年西湖人民公社三千五百多亩茶园估计平均亩产一百八十七斤，产量和质量都比1957年提高。
    西湖人民公社党委在学习和讨论了十大倡议以后，已初步确定1959年亩产茶叶力争达到四百斤，同时还要多产高级茶。为了实现这个跃进指标，公社已经开始采取一系列的增产措施。其中重要一项是整理茶园。茶蓬的密度增加了，过去每亩有茶树三百蓬左右，现在不少茶园已经进行了移植并蓬工作，一般增加到每亩四百多蓬，有的高额丰产试验茶园增加到五百多蓬。各个大队都组织移栽技术熟练的茶农来从事这一工作。估计到今年夏天，这一工作可以完成。
    让茶蓬“吃饱穿暖”，使茶树安全过冬，是社员们响应十大倡议的另一具体行动。当前，社员们正在茶园中施肥和盖稻草。
    当全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的十大倡议传到我国著名黄麻产区浙江肖山县的义蓬人民公社的时候，公社党委正在召开扩大会议。会上立即逐条阅读，展开讨论，大家争相发言，提指标，提措施，表示坚决响应十大倡议。现在公社各生产队正在普遍展开宣传、讨论十大倡议的活动。公社干部要把响应十大倡议作为推动当前生产的动力。
    义蓬公社以种植黄麻为主，1958年这个公社创造了浙江省黄麻单位面积产量最高纪录，同时棉麻都得到了大面积丰产。这次党委扩大会议在讨论十大倡议中，着重讨论了更大发展棉麻生产这一项。大家根据倡议精神修订了今年生产指标，初步确定全社种植黄麻由去年的五万二千多亩增加到六万多亩，要求平均亩产二千斤；占25％的高产田要求亩产四千斤。为了实现这个跃进规划，大家提出十分指标一定要有十二分措施，决定在当前首先大搞肥料和水利，开展积肥造肥运动，力争今年棉麻施肥量比去年增加一倍以上。
