    To adapt to the new situation after communization, various regions in Shaanxi are taking various measures to strengthen the collection and management of farm manure.
    Currently, many communes have built public toilets, dug sewage pools, and garbage pits in collective places such as nurseries, kindergartens, schools, factories, and public canteens. Urinals and ash bins have also been set up next to the houses of commune members. These manure collection facilities are managed by designated personnel. Commune members are paid a certain price for the manure they collect individually. In order to improve the quality of fertilizer, general toilets have been covered, manure piles have been sealed with mud, dry manure has been turned into liquid manure, and mixed ash manure has been separated. Mobile toilets have been set up in collective labor places.
    After the realization of communization, Shaanxi Province has created favorable conditions for large-scale manure accumulation and fertilizer production. Because there are many people in the commune, it is possible to raise pigs collectively on a large scale to accumulate manure and to build factories to produce fertilizer. For example, Lantian County established more than 1,000 bacterial fertilizer plants after communization, producing 790,000 jin of bacterial fertilizer. The amount of manure accumulated in the county in the three months after communization exceeded 1.3 times the total amount of manure accumulated in the eight months before communization.
    Weinan County has done a very good job in manure collection. The communes in this county helped commune members build pig pens to minimize the loss of pig manure; every time there was a market day in the towns, special personnel were assigned to manage the urinals and manure buckets. In order to improve the quality of fertilizer and encourage commune members to accumulate manure, each commune implemented a quota (amount and quality of fertilizer) reward system for collective pig farms, animal husbandry and breeding rooms, manure collection sites in public places, and manure accumulation and pig raising in commune member families. Last year, the county accumulated a total of 47 billion jin of fertilizer, more than double that of 1957.

### 适应公社化以后的新情况  陕西重视集体场所积肥

    适应公社化以后的新情况
    陕西重视集体场所积肥
    本报讯　陕西各地适应公社化以后的新情况，采取各种措施加强对农家肥料的搜集和管理工作。
    现在，不少公社都在托儿所、幼儿园、学校、工厂、公共食堂等集体场所修建了公共厕所，挖了污水池、垃圾坑；社员宅旁也都设置了尿缸和灰仓。这些积肥设置，都有专人管理。社员个人积的肥付给一定的代价。为了提高肥料质量，一般厕所加了盖，粪堆封了泥，变旱茅为水茅，变灰粪混攒为灰粪分攅。在集体劳动的场所，设立了流动厕所。
    陕西省各地在实现公社化以后，为大规模的积肥、造肥创造了优越的条件。由于社大人多，可以大规模的集体养猪积肥，可以办厂造肥。例如蓝田县在公社化以后就建立了一千多细菌肥料厂，生产了七十九万斤细菌肥料。全县公社化以后三个月的积肥量超过了公社化前八个月积肥总数的一点三倍。
    渭南县的积肥工作做得很有成绩。这个县的各个公社帮助社员修猪圈，尽量不让猪粪流失；每逢集镇赶集，都有专人管理尿缸和粪桶。为了提高肥料质量、鼓励社员积肥，各公社对集体猪场、畜牧饲养室、公共场所的积肥场和社员家庭积肥、养猪等，都实行了定额（肥量和质量）奖励制度。全县去年共积肥四百七十亿斤，比1957年增加一倍多。
