Summarizing Mass Experience to Open Up Sources of Fertilizer
Promoting Ten Methods: Burning, Smoking, Digging, Exchanging, Sweeping, Shoveling, Composting, Piling, Picking, and Scooping. Anhui Peasants Have Accumulated Over 35 Billion Dan of Fertilizer This Winter.

(Our Dispatch) The winter fertilizer accumulation campaign in Anhui Province has reached a high tide. By the end of 1958, the province had accumulated over 35 billion dan of various fertilizers, more than eight times the amount accumulated in the same period of 1957, enough to top-dress more than 40 million mu of summer harvest crops with an average of over 700 dan per mu.

Over the past few years, Anhui Province farmers have accumulated a great deal of experience in fertilizer accumulation and have created hundreds of fertilizer accumulation methods. These methods can be summarized in ten characters: burning, smoking, digging, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, composting, piling, picking, and scooping. This refers only to the accumulation of soil fertilizer; planting green manure and manufacturing various soil-based fertilizers are not included.

"Burning" includes: burning soil, burning "baozi" (soil clods), burning soil kilns, burning rice roots, burning soil cages, burning grass ash, etc. Burning soil fertilizer has become a well-known fertilizer accumulation method throughout Anhui Province.

Since early December 1958, about 300,000 people in the Wuhu Special District have been burning soil fertilizer every day. Many places present a scene of "smoke and fire filling the fields, with fertilizer piles everywhere." So far, this special district has burned 1 billion dan of soil fertilizer, averaging 5,000 dan per day. The Bengbu Special District has burned over 1.1 billion dan of soil fertilizer in more than a month. Many places dig up rice roots as fuel to burn soil "baozi" in the fields, which can not only use local materials but also eliminate rice borers hidden in the rice roots.

"Smoking" includes: using smoke stoves to smoke soil, cattle tail stoves to smoke soil, wall-adjacent stoves to smoke fertilizer, lime kilns to smoke fertilizer, etc., which are also common fertilizer accumulation methods used in the vast rural areas of Anhui Province. This method is simple, easy to implement, produces a large amount of fertilizer, and has good fertilizer efficiency. It is a regular fertilizer accumulation method.

"Digging" includes digging pond mud, river mud, ditch mud, peat, manure pit soil, pigpen soil, and various surface fertile soils. These muds are generally very fertile, not only containing rich humus, which can improve the soil, but also containing various nutrients necessary for crops. Large-scale application of fertile mud and soil has a significant effect on increasing crop production. Anhui Province is currently combining water conservancy construction with digging pond mud, river mud, and ditch mud. The Fuyang Special District has dug 2.48 billion dan of pond and ditch mud in more than a month. Here, the topsoil from the fields is also dug out in conjunction with the development of river network projects, used for composting, or moved to other fields to thicken the topsoil layer of farmland.

There are also many avenues for "exchanging," such as exchanging domestic soil for wild soil, cultivated soil for raw soil, fertile soil for infertile soil, old grass for new grass, old walls for new walls, old stoves for new stoves, and exchanging pigpens, cattle sheds, poultry cages, millstone paths, and road surface soil. Some people's communes, in conjunction with village planning and improving the living conditions of members, demolish old houses and build new houses, demolish old walls and replace them with new walls, and replace the withered and rotten old roof grass with new grass, accumulating a lot of fertilizer.

"Sweeping" includes sweeping dust, sweeping garbage, sweeping chimney ash, sweeping livestock shed soil, and sweeping millstone path soil and street corner fertile soil. These fertile soils have a rapid fertilizing effect and contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. At the same time, these fertilizer sources are widespread, easy to collect, and can be combined with the elimination of the four pests and sanitation work. Recently, the Fuyang Special District of this province cleared 155,000 tons of garbage in the winter campaign to eliminate the four pests.

"Composting" is also a common fertilizer accumulation method in various parts of Anhui Province. Currently, the Liu'an Special District alone has more than 1.2 million field-side composting pits. Composting pits include field-side pits, ditch pits, and "ten-thousand-year" pits. The masses praised the benefits of composting, saying: Composting materials are abundant, easy to obtain, have high fertilizer efficiency, low cost, and can improve the soil.

"Shoveling" includes shoveling sod (cutting green grass, cutting green stubble), shoveling topsoil in front of and behind houses, shoveling manure tank urine stains, wall nitrate soil, and shoveling old field ridges. The masses say: Shoveling and accumulating fertile soil has many benefits, combining fertilizer accumulation with hygiene. Farmers in the Liu'an Special District have recently combined gardening and field management and have shoveled grass and topsoil on more than 1 million field ridges, adding a lot of fertilizer for summer harvest crops.

"Piling" is the use of organic substances from animals, plants, or mixtures of both, and some minerals or soil, to form fertilizer under the action of microorganisms. The main raw materials are weeds, Artemisia stalks, dead branches and fallen leaves, aquatic plants, rice straw, wheat straw, garbage, bone scraps, peat, fish scraps, various residues and other wastes, and fertilizers made by mixing manure, urine, or sewage. Experience in various parts of Anhui Province has proven that in addition to the nutrients in compost being converted into nutrients absorbed by crops, it can also promote the activity of a large number of fixed microorganisms (such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria), increasing more nitrogen.

"Picking" is picking up wild manure, picking up everything that has no other use but has fertilizer content. This is one of the inherent seasonal fertilizer accumulation methods of Anhui Province farmers. This method of fertilizer accumulation is simple and easy to implement, and both full and semi-labor forces can do it. The masses are very accustomed to using this method to accumulate fertilizer.

"Scooping" includes scooping aquatic plants, pond mud, lake sediments, and duckweed. It can accumulate fertilizer according to local conditions. In particular, farmers in various polder areas and lake-depression areas use scooping methods to accumulate the most fertilizer.

    总结群众经验开辟积肥来源
    推广烧、熏、挖、换、扫、沤、铲、堆、拾、捞十大方法安徽农民冬季积肥已达三百五十多亿担
    本报讯　安徽省各地的冬季积肥运动已经形成高潮。1958年底，全省已积各种肥料三百五十多亿担，相当于1957年同期积肥量的八倍多，足够四千多万亩夏收作物平均每亩追肥七百多担。
    安徽省农民几年来积累了很多的积肥经验，创造了数百种的积肥方法。这些方法归纳起来，有十个字，这就是：烧、熏、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞。这是单指积造土肥说的，种绿肥和制造各种土化肥还不在内。
    “烧”，包括：烧土、烧包子、烧土窑、烧稻根、烧土笼、烧草皮灰等。烧土肥已是安徽全省家喻户晓的积肥方法。
    从1958年12月上旬以来，芜湖专区每天有三十万人左右大烧土粪，很多地方都呈现着“烟火漫田野，遍地是粪堆”的景象。到目前为止，这个专区已烧好土粪十亿担，平均日烧土粪五千担。蚌埠专区一个多月来烧的土肥也在十一亿担以上。很多地方挖出稻根作为燃料，在田里烧土包子，这样做既可以就地取材，又可以消灭藏在稻根里的螟虫。
      “熏”，有烟炉熏土、牛尾灶熏土、夹墙灶熏肥、石灰窑熏肥等，也是安徽省广大农村常常采用的积肥办法。这种办法简便易行，出肥量大，肥效也很好，是一种经常性的积肥办法。
    “挖”，包括挖塘泥、河泥、沟泥、草炭、粪坑土、猪圈土和各种地面肥土等。这些泥土一般都很肥，不但含有丰富的腐植质，可以改良土壤，而且含有农作物所必需的各种养分，大量施用肥泥、肥土，对于农作物增产有显著作用。安徽各地目前都在结合兴修水利挖塘泥、河泥和沟泥。阜阳专区一个多月来已挖塘沟泥二十四亿八千担。这里并结合开挖河网化工程把田地里的表土起出来，用做堆肥或移到别的田地里加厚农田的土层。
    “换”的门路也很多，如家土换野土、熟土换生土、肥土换瘦土、旧草换新草、老墙换新墙、陈灶换新灶以及换猪圈、牛栏、禽笼、磨道、路面土等。有些人民公社结合村庄规划和改善社员居住条件，拆旧房盖新房、拆旧墙换新墙，把枯腐的陈屋草换新草，积了很多肥料。
    “扫”，包括扫尘灰、扫垃圾、扫烟筒灰、扫牲畜棚舍土和扫磨道土、街头巷尾肥土等。这些肥土肥效快，氮、磷、钾三要素都有。同时这些肥源普遍，容易扫集，又能结合除四害和清洁卫生工作。最近，这个省的阜阳专区在开展冬季除四害运动中，清除了垃圾十五万五千多吨。
    “沤”，也是安徽各地常见的积肥方法，目前，仅六安专区沤肥的田头窖就有一百二十多万个。沤肥的窖有田头窖、阳沟窖、万年窖等。群众称赞沤肥的好处说：沤肥材料多，容易搞，肥效高，成本低，又能改良土壤。
      “铲”，包括铲草皮（割青草、打青茬），铲住宅前后的表土，铲粪缸尿垢、墙硝土以及铲旧田埂等。群众说：铲积肥土好处多，积肥卫生两结合。六安专区农民最近结合园田化，已铲了一百多万条田埂上的草和表土，为夏收作物增加了不少肥料。
      “堆”是利用动物、植物的有机物质或两者混合物和部分矿物质或土壤，在微生物的作用下面形成的肥料。主要原料有杂草、蒿秆、枯枝落叶、水草、稻草、麦秆、垃圾、骨屑、草炭、鱼杂碎、各种渣子等废物和粪尿或污水混合堆积而成的肥料。安徽各地经验证明：堆肥，除了其中营养物质能变成农作物吸收的养料外，还能促进固定大量的微生物（如固氮菌等）的活动，增加更多的氮素。
    “拾”，就是拾野粪，拾一切没有其他用处而有肥分的东西。这是安徽省农民固有的四季积肥办法之一。这样积肥简便易行，整、半劳力都能干，群众很习惯采用这种办法积肥。
      “捞”，包括捞水草、塘泥、湖淀和浮萍等。它能因地制宜进行积肥，特别是各圩区和沿湖洼地区的农民，利用捞的方法积肥最多。
