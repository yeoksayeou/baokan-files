Title: A Send-Off

    A great pioneer has set off,
    The news comes from Moscow,
    Applause sounds like firecrackers,
    We send you off to visit the moon palace.
    Magnificent scenery had long been imagined,
    The news brings much joy,
    Our hearts follow the trail and calculate the journey,
    I write poems to add color to your send-off.
    Who says there is no road to heaven?
    The red rocket blazes a trail,
    Tonight, joy soars in the world,
    Tonight, the sky is filled with clear light.
    Everyone cannot close their excited eyes,
    They raise their heads and smile towards the sky,
    Celestial music drifts down from the ninth heaven,
    In the Guanghan Palace, songs and dances are joyful.
    American boasting has been shattered,
    Soviet rockets ascend into the sky,
    Higher, higher, ever higher,
    Heaven and earth are connected by a single thread.
    "Occupying land" becomes a laughingstock, (Note)
    The news stabs at their hearts,
    Everywhere they look, there is a scene of sorrow,
    From now on, they dare not look at the moon.

  Note: American capitalists boasted: They wanted to fly to the moon and occupy land.

    壮行色
    臧克家伟大先行者已经起脚，消息来自莫斯科，掌声好似爆竹响，欢送你到月宫去作客。壮丽景色早想过，消息带来快乐多，心追行迹计行程，我写诗句壮行色。谁说上天没有路？红色火箭开先河，今夜人间腾欢乐，今夜天上清光多。人人合不上兴奋的眼，昂首带笑望青天，仙乐九霄飘飘下，广寒宫里歌舞欢。美国牛皮吹破了，苏联火箭上青霄，高升，高升，再高升，天上人间一线通。“霸占地皮”成笑柄，（注）消息刺得他心痛，举目一片伤心色，从此不敢望月明。
  注：美国资本家吹牛：枉要飞上月宫，霸占地皮。
