　　Hail the Return of Spring to the Earth!
　　The spring breeze blows from the south, and news says that Hainan Island is already in the busy season of sowing.
　　We editors, almost every year, compile and publish the spring plowing news from Hainan Island with excitement, because it is like a swallow, spreading the message of spring to readers in all directions.
　　Cadres and members of the communes, please read this message once. The land of the motherland will successively begin its annual spring plowing. Have this year's production plans in your area been properly formulated in accordance with the spirit of further developing grain, cotton, oil, and other economic crops? Are your fertilizers, seeds, and farm tools being prepared according to production needs?
　　Broad masses of urban readers, please read this message once too. You see, since Hainan Island implemented the commune system, spring plowing is indeed very different from previous years: production here is proceeding in an orderly manner, advanced farming systems are being actively promoted, and new farm tools are being widely used... From Hainan Island, we can already get a glimpse of the situation of a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    欢呼春回大地！
    春风自南方吹来，消息说海南岛已经是播种大忙季节了。
    我们作编辑工作的，几乎每年都怀着兴奋的心情编发来自海南岛的春耕消息，因为它像一支燕子，将向四方的读者传播着春天的讯息。
    公社的干部和社员们，你们把这个消息读一遍吧。祖国的大地就将陆续开始一年一度的春耕了，在你们那里今年的生产计划是不是已经根据进一步发展粮棉油和其他经济作物的精神制订妥当了？你们的肥料、种子、农具等是不是都根据生产需要在着手准备了？
    广大的城镇读者，你们也把这个消息读一遍吧。你们看，海南岛实现公社化以后，春耕与往年果然大有不同：这里的生产在井井有条地进行着，先进的耕作制度被积极推广，新式农具已在广泛使用，……。从海南岛我们已经可以窥见到今年农业生产的更大跃进的形势。
