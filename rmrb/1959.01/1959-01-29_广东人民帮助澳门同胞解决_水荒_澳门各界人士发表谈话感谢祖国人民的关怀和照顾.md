Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th - The "water shortage" problem, which has seriously threatened the lives of Macao compatriots for many years, has found a fundamental solution under the care of the people of the motherland.

For a long time, the supply of fresh water for drinking in Macao has been insufficient, with frequent "water restrictions" (limiting the amount of water residents can use each day). In severe cases, many areas have no water at all for days on end, water prices have soared, and incidents of water grabbing and panic buying have occurred frequently, making life very difficult for residents.

The people of the motherland have expressed great concern for the vital problem of Macao compatriots. In November of last year, the responsible persons of the Party and government in Zhongshan County and the former Shi岐 City, adjacent to Macao, met with representatives from Macao and stated that they accepted their request and decided to build two reservoirs in Zhuxiandong and Yinkeng within Zhongshan County, with storage capacity sufficient to meet the annual needs of Macao compatriots, fundamentally solving the difficulties of Macao compatriots in terms of water needs. On the 23rd of this month, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, also inspected the reservoir construction site and instructed the construction workers to supply fresh water to Macao as early as possible. At present, the work of building the reservoirs is progressing rapidly, and before the reservoirs are completed and supplying water, they have agreed to allow Macao to lay water pipes into the Qianshan Dam to draw water.

Grateful for this care from the people and government of the motherland, Liang Pei, Chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, He Xian, Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xiangen, Chief Engineer of the Macao Water Supply Company, and various associations and people from all walks of life in Macao, have all issued statements, believing that this event fully embodies the deep concern and care of the people of the motherland for Macao compatriots.

    广东人民帮助澳门同胞解决“水荒”
    澳门各界人士发表谈话感谢祖国人民的关怀和照顾
    新华社香港28日电　多少年来严重威胁着澳门同胞生活的“水荒”问题，已在祖国人民的关怀下找到了根本解决的途径。
    澳门食用的淡水，长期以来处在不足的状态下，经常“制水”（限制居民每天的用水量），严重时许多地方甚至一连几天涓滴全无，水价急速上涨，抢水、抢购现象大量出现，使居民生活非常困难。
    祖国人民对澳门同胞这一切身问题，表示了极大的关切。去年11月，邻近澳门的中山县和原石岐市等党和政府的负责人，在接见澳门方面的代表时，表示接受他们的请求，决定在中山县境内的竹仙洞和银坑修建两座储量足供澳门同胞全年需用的水库，根本解决澳门同胞在需水方面的困难。本月23日，中共广东省委第一书记陶铸又到水库工地视察，并指示施工人员要尽可能使淡水提前供应澳门。现在修建水库的工作正在快速进行，而且在水库修成供水以前，同意澳门方面敷设水管伸入前山水坝取水。
    感激祖国人民和政府的这种关怀，澳门工会联合会理事长梁培，澳门中华总商会理事长何贤，澳门自来水公司总工程师朱祥恩和澳门各业社团、各界人士都为此发表谈话，认为这一事件充分体现了祖国人民对澳门同胞的深切关怀和照顾。
