Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 9th. According to a proposal by left-wing members of parliament, the Belgian House of Representatives convened an emergency meeting on the 8th to hear a report from Van Hemelryck, the Minister for the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, regarding the recent bloody events in which colonial authorities in the capital of the Belgian Congo suppressed local residents.

In his report, Van Hemelryck exclaimed that Belgium's colonial rule in the Congo was in imminent danger. He said, "We are on the verge of disaster. The situation there has developed to the point where a single spark could ignite a major fire." He asked the parliament to "fully understand the significance of the recent events in the capital of the Congo." In his report, he went to great lengths to defend the Belgian colonial authorities' bloody suppression of Congolese residents, insisting that it was "necessary to prevent... disturbances."

The Belgian Communist Party caucus in the House of Representatives put forward a draft resolution proposing that a special committee be formed, composed of representatives from Belgian political parties and trade union organizations, as well as representatives from Congolese social groups, to investigate the bloody events in the Belgian Congo. The draft resolution also suggested that the government immediately take the necessary measures to guarantee democratic freedoms for Congolese residents, especially freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of trade union activities. However, the Communist Party members' draft resolution was not put to a vote. Instead, the House of Representatives decided to refer the issue of the Leopoldville bloodshed to the House Colonial Committee. Since there are no Communist Party members on the Colonial Committee, discussions within this committee would not produce serious consequences that would threaten the authorities.

On the same evening, the Belgian Parliament decided to send a nine-member delegation to the Belgian Congo to investigate the "causes and remedies" for the incident. The delegation consisted of four Christian Social Party members, three Socialist Party members, and two Liberal Party members; Communist Party members were excluded. According to Agence France-Presse, citing authoritative Belgian sources, the delegation will not investigate the issue of how Belgian colonial authorities "controlled the situation" in the recent events.

The Congolese people's struggle for independence has received support from the broad masses of progressive people in Belgium. After the incident, Communist Party member Moulin, on behalf of the Communist Party parliamentary group, wrote to the Belgian Minister of Defense, demanding an immediate halt to the Belgian army's bloody repression of the Congolese people, and demanding that the Congolese people be given independence.

The "Red Flag" published an article on the 8th by De Guchteneere, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party. He, on behalf of the Belgian Communist Party, called on the entire Belgian working class to support the Congolese people's national independence movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 9th. Brussels dispatch: The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag," in commenting on the recent mass actions against colonial rule in Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, pointed out that this was the result of the Belgian authorities ignoring the Congolese people's desire for independence.

"Red Flag" reminded readers that the Congolese people had very calmly declared their demand to be respected. None of the (Congolese) organizations that have made political or economic demands in the past few years have been willing to resort to violence. The newspaper pointed out, however, that the Belgian authorities issued arrest warrants for some leaders of the "Abako" association.

"Red Flag" emphasized that the Belgian rulers' attempt to suppress the Congolese people's independence movement with violence is completely futile, and the Congolese people will certainly not give up their struggle.

"Red Flag" said that there is only one step between the repressive measures and colonial wars that some people intend to carry out, and the Belgian people do not want an Algerian war.

    比共要求承认刚果人民独立权利
    谴责政府当局采取血腥镇压手段
    新华社9日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：根据左翼议员的提议，比利时众议院8日召集紧急会议，听取刚果和卢安达—乌隆迪大臣范埃梅里克关于最近比属刚果首府殖民当局镇压当地居民的流血事件的报告。
    范埃梅里克在报告中惊呼比利时在刚果的殖民统治岌岌可危。他说，“我们已经濒临灾难的边缘。那里的局势已经发展到只要一星火花就能燃起一场大火的地步。”他要求议会“充分了解最近在刚果首府发生的事件的重要意义”。他在报告中竭力替比利时殖民当局血腥镇压刚果居民的行动辩护，硬说那是为“防止……骚动所必需的”。
    比利时共产党众议院党团提出一项决议草案，建议由比利时各政党和工会组织的代表以及刚果社会团体的代表组成一个调查比属刚果流血事件的专门委员会。决议草案还建议政府立即采取必要的措施，保障刚果居民有民主自由，特别是出版自由、集会自由和工会活动自由。但是，共产党议员的决议草案没有被提付讨论。众议院却决定把关于利奥波德维尔的流血事件问题交众议院殖民委员会处理。在殖民委员会里没有共产党议员，因而在这个委员会里进行讨论不会产生威胁当局的严重后果。
    同一天晚上，比利时议会决定派遣一个九人代表团去比属刚果调查这次事件的“起因和补救的办法”。代表团成员由四名天主教社会党人、三名社会党人和两名自由党人组成；共产党议员被排斥在外。据法新社引比利时权威方面消息说，代表团将不调查有关比利时殖民当局在最近事件中“控制局势的方式”问题。
    比属刚果人民争取独立的行动受到了比利时广大进步人士的支持。在事件发生后，共产党议员穆兰代表共产党议会党团写信给比利时国防大臣，要求立即制止比利时军队对刚果人民的血腥镇压，并且要求给刚果人民以独立。
    “红旗报”8日刊登了比利时共产党中央委员会政治局委员德贡宁克的一篇文章，他代表比利时共产党呼吁比利时全体工人阶级支持刚果人民的民族独立运动。
    新华社巴黎9日电　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”在评论最近在比属刚果利奥波德维尔发生的反抗殖民统治的群众行动时指出，这是比利时当局无视刚果人民独立愿望的结果。
    “红旗报”提醒读者说，刚果人民曾经十分平静地宣布过它要求受到尊重。在过去几年中提出政治或经济要求的（刚果人）组织没有一个愿意采用暴力。报纸指出，但是比利时当局却对“阿巴科”协会一些领袖发出拘捕证。
    “红旗报”强调指出，比利时统治者企图用暴力镇压刚果人民的独立运动完全是徒劳的，刚果人民肯定不会放弃自己的斗争。
    “红旗报”说，在某些人所打算进行的镇压手段和殖民战争之间，只有一步之隔，而比利时人民不愿要一场阿尔及利亚战争。
