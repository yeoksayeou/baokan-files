Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 15th: Former US Air Force Secretary and Democrat, Symington, stated in the Senate on the 12th that Vice President Nixon's claim that the US is ahead of the Soviet Union in missiles is aimed at "deceiving the people."

Nixon boasted to the American press on the 11th that the US is now ahead of the Soviet Union in the development of military missiles and is rapidly catching up in other aspects of the space race. Symington said, "To my knowledge, no impartial expert in the missile field would support this conclusion."

Symington demanded that Nixon explain how many operational intercontinental ballistic missiles the US will have by the end of this year, and how many the US intelligence agencies estimate the Soviet Union will have.

Symington said, "It seems that senior officials of this government are constantly trying to deceive the people and put them in a state of complacency, while the facts prove that this complacency is unfounded."

    薛明顿打尼克松一嘴巴
    指出所谓美国导弹超过苏联是骗人鬼话
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国前空军部长、民主党人薛明顿12日在参议院发言时指责副总统尼克松所谓在导弹方面美国走在苏联前面的说法目的在于“哄骗人民”。
    尼克松在11日曾对美国的报界吹牛说，现在美国在发展军用导弹方面走在苏联的前面，而在空间竞赛的其他方面则在迅速赶上。薛明顿说，“就我所知，导弹界中没有一个公正无私的专家会支持这种结论。”
    薛明顿要求尼克松说明美国到今年年底将拥有多少作战用的洲际弹道导弹，而据美国的情报机构估计苏联将会有多少。
    薛明顿说，“看来，这个政府的高级官员在不断地设法哄骗人民，让他们处于一种自满状态，而事实却证明这种自满是没有根据的。”
