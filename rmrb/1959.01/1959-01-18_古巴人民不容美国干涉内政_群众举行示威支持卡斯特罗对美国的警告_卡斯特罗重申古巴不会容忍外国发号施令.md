(Reported comprehensively by our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Havana - The Cuban people warmly welcome and express support for the warning issued by Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, Castro, on the 15th regarding the US reactionary groups' attempt to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.

As reported, all Havana newspapers published Castro's solemn warning to the United States against interfering in Cuba's internal affairs on the front page on the 16th. That evening, thousands of workers and students held a demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace, supporting the government's decision to continue trying and executing Batista's murderers. The demonstrators held up banners with slogans such as: "Yankees, this is our business!" "Continue the executions, punish the murderers!"

On the same day, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, Castro, delivered a speech at the tomb of Eduardo Chibás, a Cuban freedom fighter who sacrificed his life for freedom, again fiercely criticizing the threatening policies adopted by the United States towards the Cuban government. Castro condemned the United States for using "slander" and the threat of "gunboat diplomacy" to oppose the Cuban provisional government, because there was no one within this government "who could be bribed or bought." He emphasized that "Cuba will not tolerate any dictation." Castro called on the Cuban people to hold an unprecedented mass rally of 500,000 people on the 21st "to protest foreign interference." In his speech, Castro also condemned the US military mission for training Batista's army to massacre the Cuban people and demanded that the US government return the Batista war criminals who fled to the United States and the money they took with them.

Cuban Provisional President Urrutia announced on the 16th that the Cuban Constitution of 1940 had been amended and that both the regular courts of the Cuban government and the current military courts had the power to sentence murderers to death. It is reported that President Urrutia condemned those who sympathize with the Batista regime for "inciting a movement against the current Cuban government." He said that the Cuban government would publish the evidence of Batista's murderers' crimes.

Prior to this, Minister of State of the Provisional Government, Agramonte, issued a statement on the 15th refuting the malicious claims that the Cuban government was carrying out "mass executions" and was not trying criminals according to "democratic procedures." Agramonte said that the trials were conducted "according to Article 17 of the revolutionary criminal law enacted during the revolutionary period." The minister said that according to these provisions, every defendant has a defense lawyer and the opportunity to speak.

Other news stated that the Cuban government announced on the 16th that it would firmly demand the extradition of dictator Batista and demand the return of the plane that Batista and his cronies took when they fled to the Dominican Republic on New Year's Day this year.

Raúl Castro, head of the Cuban Armed Forces Oriente Province, revealed the heinous crimes committed by the former dictatorial government at a press conference held on the 15th, refuting the clamor from the United States against Cuba's punishment of criminals. Raúl Castro said that Batista's dictator had killed tens of thousands of Cubans in the past six years. More "new evidence" of the Batista dictatorial regime's massacre of the people is discovered every day. He said, "In every (former government) army stronghold throughout the province of Oriente, there are secret cemeteries where the bodies of victims are buried."

He said that sixty-seven bodies with railroad spikes nailed into their heads were found in a mass grave in Manzanillo, and twenty-five bodies were found in another grave in the city; twenty bodies were found in Nicaro.

Raúl Castro emphasized the justice of the Cuban provisional government's punishment of criminals, saying, "There will be more trials, more convictions, and more executions."

    古巴人民不容美国干涉内政
    群众举行示威支持卡斯特罗对美国的警告
    卡斯特罗重申古巴不会容忍外国发号施令
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：哈瓦那消息：古巴人民热烈欢迎和表示支持古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗15日就美国反动集团妄图干预古巴内政所提出的警告。
    据报道，哈瓦那各报16日都在第一版上刊登了卡斯特罗对美国所提出的不要干预古巴内政的严正警告。当天晚上，数千名工人和学生在总统府门前举行了示威游行，支持政府关于继续审讯和处决巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的决定。示威群众高举着标语，上面写着：“美国佬，这是我们的事！”“继续进行处决，制裁杀人犯！”
    同一天，古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在为争取自由而牺牲的古巴自由战士爱德华多·奇巴斯的墓地上发表演说，再次猛烈抨击美国对古巴政府所采取的威胁政策。卡斯特罗谴责美国使用“毁谤”和“炮舰外交”的威胁手段来反对古巴临时政府，因为这个政府内部没有一个人“可以被他们贿赂或收买”。他强调说，“古巴不会容忍任何发号施令”。卡斯特罗号召古巴人民在21日举行一次空前未有的五十万人的群众大会“来抗议外国的干涉”。卡斯特罗在演说中还谴责美国军事代表团训练巴蒂斯塔军队来屠杀古巴人民，并且要求美国政府送回逃到美国去的巴蒂斯塔战争罪犯和他们所带走的金钱。
    古巴临时总统乌鲁蒂亚16日宣布：古巴1940年的宪法已经加以修改，古巴政府的正规法庭以及目前的军事法庭都有权判处杀人罪犯死刑。据报道，乌鲁蒂亚总统谴责那些同情巴蒂斯塔政权的人“正在鼓动一个反对目前古巴政府的运动”。他说，古巴政府将公布巴蒂斯塔杀人犯的罪证。
    在这以前，临时政府国务部长阿格拉蒙特在15日发表的一项声明中，驳斥了所谓古巴政府在进行“大规模处决”和不是按“民主程序”来审判罪犯这种别有用心的说法。阿格拉蒙特说，审判是按“革命时期所制订的革命法律的第十七条刑法进行的”。这位部长说，根据这些条款，每一个被告都有辩护律师，并且有机会讲话。
    另有消息说，古巴政府16日宣布：它将坚决要求引渡独裁者巴蒂斯塔，并且要求交还巴蒂斯塔和他的亲信在今年元旦逃往多米尼加时所搭乘的飞机。
    古巴武装部队奥连特省首脑劳尔·卡斯特罗在15日举行的记者招待会上揭露了前独裁政府所犯下的滔天罪行，驳斥从美国来的对古巴惩治罪犯的叫嚣。劳尔·卡斯特罗说，巴蒂斯塔独裁者在过去六年中杀害了成千上万的古巴人。每天都发现更多的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权屠杀人民的“新罪证”。他说，“在奥连特省全省每一个（前政府的）陆军据点，都有埋葬受害者尸体的秘密墓地。”
    他说，在曼萨尼罗的一个集体墓穴里发现了六十七具头颅上钉有铁道钉的尸体，在这个城市的另一个墓穴里发现二十五具尸体；在尼凯罗发现二十具尸体。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗强调指出了古巴临时政府惩治罪犯的正义性，他说，“还要进行审讯，还要判罪，还要处决。”
