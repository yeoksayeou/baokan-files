The Secrets of the Earth

    Will History Repeat Itself?
    Shigong
    If we could understand the historical face of the Earth, it would be easier to find mines. But how can we know what the Earth was like hundreds of millions of years ago?
    As early as 1074 AD, during the Song Dynasty in China, Shen Kuo discovered the fact in the Taihang Mountains that some cliffs contained snail and clam shells and pebbles. Later, he correctly pointed out that the place where this cliff was located was once an ancient seashore. Because today's seashore tells us: there are many shells and pebbles on the seashore.
    It can be seen that the Earth's surface has undergone many changes. China has long had the scientific concept of the sea changing into mulberry fields, and mulberry fields changing into the sea. The great Russian scientist Lomonosov also expounded the idea of ​​understanding the history of the Earth from modern changes in his "On the Layers of the Earth" published in 1763. However, in Europe, the idea that God created a world that is eternal and unchanging has long hindered people from understanding the Earth's past. In 1686, the Danish Steno was burned alive by the church for proposing the view that there had been changes in the land and sea. Later, the idealist "catastrophism" school represented by Cuvier appeared. This school acknowledged that there had been changes on the ground, but believed that these changes were only accidental qualitative changes. Due to unknown reasons, all organisms suddenly became extinct, the terrain also changed, everything started all over again, and history was interrupted. Obviously, this is just "substituting a series of repeated acts of creation for God's single act of creation, making miracles the fundamental driving force of nature."
  (Engels: "Dialectics of Nature," p. 10) According to Cuvier, the historical face of the Earth is unknowable. It was not until 1830-1833, when Lyell of England published his book "Principles of Geology," that reason was first introduced into geology in Europe.
    Lyell proposed the method of "the present is the key to understanding the past." We know that mud and sand are constantly carried by running water to the oceans and lakes and accumulate, eventually becoming layered rock – sedimentary rock. Many high mountains are composed of sedimentary rocks. Seeing these mountains, we can immediately think that this is where the ancient ocean was located. We also know that running water cannot carry sand and stones that are too large and heavy very far. Therefore, the closer to the shore, the coarser the accumulated sand and stones, and the farther away, the finer. When we see the thickness of the particles inside the sedimentary rock, we can infer the location of the sea: Where is the center? Where is the edge?
    By linking today's phenomena with the rocks formed in ancient times, we have found a way to understand the past. For example, in places where glaciers pass today, the surface of some rocks is scratched with streaks. Even if such rocks are found in places with warm climates today, it can be speculated that there were severe cold glaciers in this place before. There are many such examples to think about carefully.
    According to this, does history repeat itself? No, Lyell's method is not completely consistent with the truth of nature. According to him, changes on Earth are only mechanically repeated in cycles. Actually, it is not like that. For example, with volcanic activity, we can understand ancient volcanoes from the products of today's volcanic eruptions. If the same stones are found somewhere as the lava flowing out of today's volcanic eruptions, we can know that there were volcanoes here in the past. However, today's volcanic activity is not exactly the same as before. Today's volcanoes mostly erupt from one point, while earlier volcanoes mostly erupted in large quantities along cracks, and the lava flowed very widely; even earlier, there was so much lava that it simply melted through the rocks covering it. This shows that in the early days of the Earth, the crust was still somewhat fragile, but today it is relatively stable, so the situation of volcanic activity is different.
    Only by connecting objective conditions and viewing them from the perspective of development can we correctly understand the historical face of the Earth.
    [Editor's note] A total of seventeen articles have been published in the "Secrets of the Earth" column, and now they have all been published.
    In these articles, starting from the general problems of geology and prospecting, the geological effects caused by the internal forces of the earth and the forces from outside the earth are introduced in sequence, and finally, the age of the earth and how to understand its history are discussed. The author tries not to introduce scientific knowledge purely objectively, but also hopes to help readers recognize the superiority of our socialist system in the struggle against nature; to recognize the role of human labor in the development of the earth.
    Our opening of this column to introduce scientific knowledge is only an attempt. Whether it is a single article or the organization of the entire column, there are still many shortcomings. We hope that readers will put forward their opinions, and we also hope that scientific workers will write more knowledge sketches for us.

    历史会重演吗？
    石工
    如果能够认清地球的历史面貌，找起矿来就方便了。可是怎么能知道亿万年前地球是什么样子呢？
    远在公元1074年我国宋朝的沈括就在太行山发现了这样的事实：有的山崖间含有螺蚌壳和卵石。后来他就正确地指出，在这山崖的地方，曾经是远古的海滨。因为今天的海滨告诉我们：在海滨，贝壳和卵石都很多。
    可见，地球的表面经过了许多变化。我国很早就有了沧海变桑田，桑田变沧海的科学观念。伟大的俄国科学家罗蒙诺索夫在1763年发表的“论地层”中，也阐述了从现代的变化去认识地球历史的思想。可是在欧洲，上帝创造的世界永恒不变的说法，长期阻碍着人们去认识地球的过去。1686年，丹麦的史丹诺因为提出了海陆曾经有过变迁的见解，便被教会活活地烧死。以后又出现了以居维叶这个人为代表的唯心主义“质变”学派。这个学派虽然承认地面上有过变迁，但认为这种变迁不过是偶然的质变。由于不可知的原因，生物突然全部毁灭，地形也改变了，一切重新来过，历史也中断了。显然，这不过是“以一整系列的重复的创造行动代替了上帝的单一的创造行动，使神迹成为自然的根本的原动力。”
  （恩格斯：“自然辩证法”第10页）按照居维叶的说法，地球的历史面貌是不可知的。直到1830—1833年间，英国的莱伊尔出版了“地质学原理”一书以后，欧洲的地质学中才第一次带进了理性。
    莱伊尔提出了“现在是认识过去的钥匙”这个方法。我们知道，泥砂不断被流水带到海洋湖泊里堆积起来，终于变成了成层的岩石沉积岩。很多高山是沉积岩构成的，看见这些山，我们就可马上想到这是古代的海洋所在。我们还知道，流水不能把太大太重的砂、石带到很远，因此距岸愈近的地方，堆积的砂石愈粗，愈远愈细。当我们看出沉积岩内部颗粒的粗细时，便可以推想到大海的位置：哪里是中心？哪里是边缘？
    把今天的现象和在远古生成的石头之间联系起来，我们便找到了一条认识过去的道路。比如今天冰川经过的地方，把一些石头的表面擦出条纹，那末即使在现在气候温暖的地方发现了这种石头，也可以推测从前在这个地方有过严寒的冰川。这样的例子，细想起来还很多。
    照这样说来，难道历史会重演吗？不会的，莱伊尔的方法，还不完全符合自然的真实。按照他的说法，地球上的变化不过是周而复始地机械地重复。其实不然，比如火山活动，我们可以从今天火山喷发时的产物去认识古代的火山。如果某处发现了和今天火山喷发时流出的熔岩相同的石头，便可以知道过去这里有过火山。但是，今天的火山活动和从前是不完全相同的。今天的火山多半从一点迸发出来，早些时候的火山则多沿着裂缝大量喷发，熔岩流布很广；更早一些时候，熔岩是如此之多，干脆把盖住它的岩石都熔透了。这说明在地球的早期，地壳还有些脆弱，到了今天，却已比较稳固，所以火山活动的情况是不同的。
    我们只有联系客观条件从发展上去看，才能正确认识地球的历史面貌。
    〔编者附记〕“大地的秘密”这一栏，一共刊出了十七篇文章，现在，全部刊登完了。
    在这些文章中，从地质和找矿的一般性问题谈起，顺次介绍了由于地球的内部力量和来自地球外部的力量所引起的地质作用，最后谈了一下地球的年龄和怎样去认识它的历史。作者试图不是纯客观地介绍科学知识，而是希望还能帮助读者认识到我们的社会主义制度在同自然斗争中的优越性；认识到人类的劳动在地球的发展过程中所起的作用。
    我们开辟这个介绍科学知识的专栏，还只是一个尝试，无论就单独一篇文章或整个专栏的组织来看，都还存在许多缺点，希望读者提出意见，更希望科学工作者们多为我们写些知识小品的文章。
