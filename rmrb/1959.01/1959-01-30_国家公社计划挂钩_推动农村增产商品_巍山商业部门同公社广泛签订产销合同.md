    Weishan Commercial Departments Widely Sign Production and Sales Contracts with Communes

    Kunming Dispatch from Our Newspaper, January 29th: Commercial departments in Weishan County, Yunnan Province, have widely signed production and sales contracts with all the people's communes in the county, helping the communes to correctly arrange self-sufficient production and commodity production.

    In a short period, commercial departments throughout the county signed more than 200 production and sales contracts with various communes. In the first quarter, the communes sold more than 80 varieties of products, with a total value of more than 3.18 million yuan, accounting for 66% of the total output value of commune-run industries and sideline production in the first quarter.

    When the contract system was first promoted, the Weishan County Party Committee educated cadres in the commercial departments on the role of the contract system in promoting commodity production; it convened meetings of responsible persons from various people's communes, as well as financial and grain, and supply and marketing cadres, to explain the significance of state procurement of commodities, as well as varieties, quantities, and specifications. Everyone unanimously recognized that the widespread implementation of the contract system had four major benefits for expanding self-sufficient production and commodity production: (1) Commercial departments can guide production and solve supply and marketing problems through contracts, allowing for the great development of commune production; (2) Communes can sell more products, especially non-staple foods, to support industrial and mining cities; (3) Communes can increase cash income; (4) Production is incorporated into the state plan, ensuring that the commodities produced by the communes have a market, and the commercial departments have a guaranteed source of goods. All communes throughout the county widely and thoroughly publicized these four benefits, which vigorously promoted the development of the contract system. The County Party Committee also organized the masses to discuss issues such as whether urban and rural areas should help each other and the relationship between the part and the whole. After discussion, Weishan People's Commune established an overall concept, and after reasonable arrangements, in addition to ensuring a certain amount of meat for commune members, signed a contract with the commercial department to sell fifty-five fat pigs before the Spring Festival. A brigade of Baohua People's Commune originally wanted to keep small non-staple foods such as honey, peppers, and sunflower seeds for commune members to eat themselves; after discussion, everyone thought: Many people's daughters and sons are in industry and mining, and if everyone only cares about themselves and does not sell non-staple foods, what will they eat? Moreover, the state is so concerned about the lives of our commune members, and we should also support the state. Therefore, they signed a contract with the commercial department to sell some small non-staple foods as commodities to the state.

    国家公社计划挂钩  推动农村增产商品
    巍山商业部门同公社广泛签订产销合同
    本报昆明29日电　云南省巍山县商业部门和全县各人民公社广泛签订产销合同，帮助公社正确安排自给性生产和商品性生产。
    全县商业部门用不长的时间就和各公社签订了二百多份产销合同。第一季度公社出售的产品有八十多个品种，总值达三百一十八万多元，占全县各人民公社第一季度社办工业和副业产值的66％。
    刚开始推广合同制度的时候，中共巍山县委教育商业部门的干部认识了推广合同制度对促进商品生产的作用；召集各人民公社负责人及财粮、供销干部开会，讲解了国家采购商品的意义，以及品种、数量和规格等。大家一致认识到，广泛实行合同制度，对扩大自给性生产和商品性生产有四大好处：（一）商业部门通过合同指导生产，解决供销问题，公社生产可以大发展；（二）公社可以多出售产品，特别是副食品，支援工矿城市；（三）公社可以增加现金收入；（四）生产纳入国家计划，公社生产的商品有销路，商业部门组织货源有保障。全县各公社广泛深入地宣传了这四点好处，有力地推动了合同制的开展。县委还组织群众讨论了城乡应否互助、局部与整体的关系等问题。巍山人民公社经过辩论以后，树立了整体观念，经过合理安排，除保证社员一定肉食外，同商业部门签订了春节前出售五十五口肥猪的合同。宝华人民公社的一个大队原来想把蜂蜜、辣椒、葵瓜子等小副食品都留给社员自己吃；经过辩论，大家想到：许多人的姑娘、儿子都在工矿，大家只顾自己不卖副食品，他们吃什么？再说，国家这样关心我们公社社员的生活，我们也应该支援国家。于是，他们同商业部门签订合同，把一些小副食品作为商品卖给国家。
