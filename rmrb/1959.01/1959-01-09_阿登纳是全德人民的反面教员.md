    Adenauer is a Negative Example for All German People
    Liu Qibao
  In 1958, the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was estimated to have increased by 10.7% compared to the previous year, and grain output increased by about 700,000 tons. Encouraged by the slogan "Striving for 1,200 days to surpass West Germany in per capita consumption levels," the people of the GDR greatly accelerated the pace of socialist construction. But what about West Germany? In the first three quarters, industrial production increased by only 2.8% compared to the same period last year, and grain output even decreased by 3%. The waves of the economic crisis from across the Atlantic suddenly shattered the myth of West Germany's so-called "continuous prosperity," and Adenauer's days are very difficult. In addition to these ironclad facts, Adenauer also acts as a "negative example," using a large amount of negative material to prove that he is an enemy of the German people, while the GDR represents the interests of all German people.
    Is there any greater lie?
    The German people urgently demand the reunification of the motherland into a peaceful and democratic country. But in West Germany, the dutiful descendants of Hitler are rampant again. In this situation, the GDR put forward specific proposals for the two Germanys to gradually move towards unification through the establishment of a confederation. This proposal is practical, feasible, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. But Adenauer wants to "annex" the GDR, and even clamors to extend the national border to the east of the Oder River. In this way, Adenauer has even been strongly opposed by many bourgeois politicians, because Adenauer's policy means world war and atomic death. In September last year, Professor Hagmann, one of the founders of the West German Christian Democratic Union, came to the GDR and agreed with the proposal for a confederation at the meeting of the National Front. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, explained this proposal to him in detail, and also told him that ministers of the Adenauer government had first come to Berlin to discuss the confederation issue with representatives of the GDR government, and that we considered this proposal. However, as far as Adenauer is concerned, anyone who advocates negotiations with the GDR has committed a heinous crime. Therefore, the news that the "confederation" concept first came from a minister of the West German government shocked the entire West German public opinion. Adenauer knew that this was not good, so he came out twice to refute the rumors, and the ministers of the Bonn government were ordered to sign statements saying that this was not the case. The GDR further disclosed some facts, and Western journalists carefully checked these facts and could almost guess the name of the minister. A few days later, Schäffer, the West German Finance Minister two years ago and current Minister of Justice, had to admit that he had talked about this matter with Lieutenant General Müller, then Deputy Minister of National Defense of the GDR. He also said that Adenauer agreed to him coming to the GDR for negotiations. In this way, Adenauer's refutation became an open lie. However, Adenauer shamelessly announced that he had also notified Dulles about this matter!
    Even the right-wing leaders of the West German opposition parties, who have always followed Adenauer's policy of "not negotiating with the GDR," are very dissatisfied with Adenauer and even demanded that Schäffer explain to the parliament. Some newspapers clamored for Schäffer to step down. Of course, the best way is not to ask Schäffer to step down, but to sit down and negotiate with the GDR. But Adenauer is unwilling to sit down and negotiate.
    But no matter whether Adenauer refutes rumors or lies, people draw the conclusion from this negative example: this West German Chancellor, who talks about unifying Germany, actually wants the division of Germany to continue forever.
    What is the calculation?
    Although the Adenauer government has taken a series of measures, West German industrial production is in a state of stagnation and even has a downward trend. Industrial sectors such as hard coal, steel, and textiles have produced large surpluses. The number of unemployed reached 930,000 by the end of last year. By the end of October last year, 8.3 million tons of hard coal had been accumulated, and the lives of miners were greatly affected. Capitalists are in a mess and racking their brains, making many efforts to sell accumulated goods. Perhaps based on the Americans' so-called "unity," American hard coal still comes in continuously, adding to the coal mountains accumulated in the Ruhr area. West German capitalists complained about this "unity," complaining that Adenauer would not calculate and demanding resistance to American coal imports. Adenauer still ignored this.
    In order to help the workers' brothers in West Germany who are threatened by the crisis, in October last year, the GDR government suggested signing a special trade agreement at the government level, in which the GDR would buy 4 million tons of hard coal, 200,000 tons of steel, and 80 million to 90 million marks worth of chemicals, leather shoes, and textiles from West Germany, while selling 4 million tons of lignite briquettes, 650,000 tons of wheat, 40,000 tons of sugar, and 20,000 tons of pork to West Germany. The broad masses of the people in West Germany, and even many large capitalists, warmly welcomed this proposal. What is puzzling is the attitude of the Adenauer government, which initially said that it did not know about this matter, and then said a few days later that the people of the GDR living in "poverty and disaster" did not have such great economic power. Adenauer's bad attitude angered the broad masses of the West German people. Miners in five cities in the Ruhr area held rallies, and more than 600 manufacturers attended the meeting of the West German All-German Trade Promotion Committee, accusing the Adenauer government of its stubborn attitude. The parliamentary groups of the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party also declared that they did not agree with the Adenauer government's approach.
    However, the stubborn elements are actually stubborn but not solid, and when they are stubborn to the end, they will change. The stubborn Adenauer, frightened by the pressure of the people, had to entrust the West German Trade Office to sign a contract with the GDR on November 20 last year. In order to cover up his ugliness, Adenauer only agreed to sell 1 million tons of hard coal from West Germany in the contract. Even so, the people's struggle has finally achieved a preliminary victory.
    This matter tells the German people: the GDR defends the interests of all German people. Adenauer is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. As long as the people rise up to struggle, they can change the policy of the Adenauer government. Therefore, the people of West Germany are currently continuing their struggle to realize the full content of the GDR's trade proposals.
    What kind of logic is this?
    In order to ease international tensions and promote a peaceful solution to the German question, the Soviet Union decided to withdraw its troops from Berlin, transfer all its powers in Berlin to the GDR government, and at the same time demand an end to the occupation regime in West Berlin, making West Berlin a demilitarized free city. Now the world's public opinion is talking about this peaceful proposal.
    In November last year, at a meeting of the National Committee of the National Front of the GDR, many well-known people from West Berlin and West Germany, including bank managers, professors, journalists, members of the Social Democratic Party, workers in the Ruhr area, writers, etc., advocated accepting the Soviet proposal. They expressed their warm support for Ulbricht's speech at the meeting.
    At the Berlin Christmas market, I accidentally met the famous German writer Wilhelm Bredel. He talked excitedly about the Soviet proposal on the Berlin issue. He said: "In West Berlin, there is no Christmas market this year. At least one-third of the tourists in this Christmas market come from West Berlin. Look how free they are, but they don't need American tanks and West German agents to protect their safety!"
    Isn't that exactly the case? West Berlin becoming a demilitarized free city will temporarily cause those agents and spies to lose their jobs and cause temporary difficulties in life. But for the two million residents of West Berlin and world peace, it is a very good thing. The government and people of the GDR stated that if West Berlin becomes a peaceful free city, they will take a series of measures to improve West Berlin's economic life, transportation conditions, and so on.
    Many people in the public opinion circles of West Germany and Western countries have expressed that they want to consider the Soviet proposal. But what about Adenauer? He came up with a lot of strange logic that no one understands. He thinks it is a normal phenomenon for the armies of four countries to be stationed in a city for thirteen or fourteen years. But the armies of the four major powers cannot stay in Berlin for ten thousand years! He described the Soviet army's withdrawal from Berlin as the Soviet Union's attempt to "invade" West Berlin. It's really inconsistent and irrelevant.
    Dulles of the United States is exactly the same as Adenauer, and also has a set of strange logic. In his speech on December 4 last year, he described the stationing of troops in the heart of the German Democratic Republic as defending peace and American "security." In this way, for the safety of the people of all countries, the governments of all countries should station their own troops in Washington.
    The German people have further recognized from this incident that Adenauer is the only prime minister in German history who uses all his policies to protect the foreign occupation of Germany, and is an "occupation prime minister."
    Adenauer's policy of selling out national interests has damaged the self-esteem that the German people should have. But the German people also saw that the first worker-peasant regime in German history, the German Democratic Republic, represents the interests of all German people and the interests of the German nation.
    Adenauer's revival of militarism in West Germany is not only resolutely opposed by socialist countries, but also the people of Northern Europe and Western Europe, who have suffered deeply from Nazism, have expressed great unease about the return of Hitler's generals to power. When Britain and France invaded Egypt and the United States and Britain invaded Lebanon and Jordan, the Adenauer government pretended to be neutral and secretly supported them. When American and British imperialism was notorious, West German Economic Minister ran around, trying to fill the "vacuum" in the Asia-Africa region and carry out economic expansion, blatantly showing the face of imperialism. But the people of all countries see that there is a strong, peace-loving German Democratic Republic on German soil. The delegation of the GDR government, headed by Premier Grotewohl, is visiting the United Arab Republic and Iraq, and will visit India, which will undoubtedly deepen the friendship between the German people and the people of Asian and African countries. This will also enable the people of all countries to further recognize that it is the German Democratic Republic that represents the interests of all German people.

### 阿登纳是全德人民的反面教员

    阿登纳是全德人民的反面教员
    刘祺宝
  1958年，民主德国的工业产量估计比前年增加10.7％，谷物产量大约比前年增加七十万吨。民主德国人民在“奋战一千二百天在按人口计算的消费水平方面超过西德”的口号的鼓舞下，大大加快了社会主义建设的速度。可是在西德呢？在前三个季度，比起前年同一时期来，工业生产仅增加2.8％，谷物产量还下降了3％。来自大西洋彼岸的经济危机的波涛，一下子冲破了所谓西德经济“不断繁荣”的神话，阿登纳的日子难过得很。除了这铁一般的事实外，阿登纳还充当“反面教员”，用大量反面教材证明自己是德国人民的敌人，而民主德国则代表全德人民的利益。
    还有更大的谎言吗？
    德国人民迫切要求祖国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的民主的国家。但是在西德，希特勒的孝子贤孙又在飞扬跋扈。在这种情况下，民主德国提出了两个德国通过建立邦联的道路而逐步走向统一的具体建议。这个建议切实可行、深入人心。但是阿登纳想“并吞”民主德国，甚至扬言要把国界扩展到奥得河以东去。这样，阿登纳甚至遭到了许多资产阶级政治家的强烈反对，因为阿登纳的政策意味着世界大战，意味着原子死亡。去年9月间，西德基督教民主联盟创始人之一哈格曼教授来到了民主德国，在全国阵线的会议上赞同关于邦联的建议。德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希向他详细地阐述了这一建议，并且顺便告诉他，首先是阿登纳政府的部长来到柏林与民主德国政府的代表谈过邦联问题，我们考虑了这一个建议。但是，谁主张和民主德国谈判，对阿登纳说来，谁就犯下了弥天大罪。所以，“邦联”观念首先出自西德政府一位部长之口的消息，震动了整个西德的舆论界。阿登纳知道这事不妙，便两次出来辟谣，波恩政府的部长们奉命纷纷签字声明，说是并无此事。民主德国再披露了一些事实，西方记者根据这些事实仔细核对，几乎可以猜中那位部长的大名了。两年前的西德财政部长、现任司法部长谢菲尔隔了几天不得不承认，他曾和当时的民主德国国防部副部长米勒中将谈过此事。他还说，阿登纳同意他来民主德国谈判的。这样，阿登纳的辟谣变成公然撒谎了。然而阿登纳还恬不知耻地宣布，他还曾经把这件事通知过杜勒斯呢！
    一向在“不与民主德国谈判”这个政策上追随阿登纳的西德反对党的右派领袖，也对阿登纳大为不满，甚至要求谢菲尔向议会交代。有的报纸吵着要谢菲尔下台。当然，最好的办法不是要谢菲尔下台，而是坐下来和民主德国谈判。但是阿登纳不愿意坐下来谈判。
    但是不管阿登纳辟谣也好，撒谎也好，人们却从这一反面教材中得出结论：这位口口声声要统一德国的西德总理，实际上要使德国的分裂状态永远继续下去。
    这打的是什么算盘？
    阿登纳政府虽然采取了一系列措施，但是，西德工业生产已处在停滞状态，而且有下降的趋势。硬煤、钢和纺织等工业部门生产大量过剩。失业人数到去年年底已达九十三万。至去年10月底，已积压了八百三十万吨硬煤，矿工生活大受影响。资本家弄得焦头烂额，大伤脑筋，为销售积压商品作了多方面的努力。也许是根据美国人的所谓“团结”，美国的硬煤还是源源而来，加高了鲁尔区积压起来的煤山。对于这种“团结”，西德资本家怨声载道，埋怨阿登纳不会打算盘，要求抵制美煤进口。对此，阿登纳依然置之不理。
    为了援助西德遭受危机威胁的工人兄弟，去年10月间，民主德国政府建议签订一项政府级的特别贸易协定，由民主德国从西德买进四百万吨硬煤，二十万吨钢材，价值八千至九千万马克的化学品、皮鞋和纺织品，同时向西德卖出四百万吨褐煤砖、六十五万吨小麦、四万吨白糖和二万吨猪肉。西德广大人民，甚至不少大资本家都热烈欢迎这一建议。令人费解的是阿登纳政府的态度，起初说不知道有这么一回事，隔几天又说生活在“贫困和灾难”中的民主德国人民没有这么大的经济力量。阿登纳的这种恶劣态度激怒了广大的西德人民。鲁尔区的五个城市的矿工举行了集会，六百多家厂商出席了西德全德贸易促进委员会的会议，纷纷指责阿登纳政府的顽固态度。社会民主党和自由民主党的议会党团，也声明不同意阿登纳政府的作法。
    但是，顽固分子，实际上是顽而不固，顽到后来，就要变了。顽固分子阿登纳，怯于人民的压力，不得不于去年11月20日委派西德贸易办事处与民主德国签订了合同。阿登纳为了遮丑，合同上只同意由西德卖出一百万吨硬煤。即使如此，人民的斗争，总算取得了初步的胜利。
    这件事情告诉德国人民：民主德国捍卫着全德人民的利益。阿登纳外强中干，只要人民起来斗争，就能改变阿登纳政府的政策。因此，目前西德人民正在为实现民主德国贸易建议的全部内容而继续进行着斗争。
    这算是什么逻辑？
    为了缓和国际紧张局势和促进德国问题的和平解决，苏联决定把驻军撤出柏林，把在柏林的全部职权移交给民主德国政府，同时要求结束西柏林的占领制度，使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市。现在全世界的舆论界都在谈论这一个和平建议。
    去年11月，在一次民主德国全国阵线全国委员会的会议上，西柏林和西德的许多著名人士，包括银行经理、教授、记者、社会民主党党员、鲁尔区的工人、作家等，都主张接受苏联的建议。他们对乌布利希在会上的发言，表示热烈的赞同。
    在柏林市圣诞节市场上，我偶然遇到了德国著名作家威廉·勃莱特尔。他兴高采烈地谈起了苏联关于柏林问题的建议。他说：“在西柏林，今年没有圣诞节市场。在这个圣诞节市场上，至少有三分之一的游客来自西柏林。你看，他们多么自由自在，可是，他们并不需要美国坦克和西德特务来保护他们的安全啊！”
    事情难道不正是这样吗？西柏林成了非军事化的自由城市，虽然会使那些特务间谍暂时失业，造成生活上的暂时困难。但是，对西柏林二百万居民和世界和平说来，真是一件非常好的好事。民主德国的政府和人民表示，如果西柏林一旦成了和平的自由城市，他们将采取一系列措施，来改善西柏林的经济生活、交通条件等等。
    西德和西方国家舆论界不少人士都表示要考虑苏联的建议。但是阿登纳呢？他搬出了一大堆谁也不懂的奇怪逻辑。四个国家的军队驻在一个城市十三、四年，他认为是正常的现象。但是，四大国军队不能一千年一万年的留在柏林啊！苏军要撤出柏林，他说成是苏联要“侵略”西柏林。真是前言不对后语，牛头不对马嘴。
    美国的杜勒斯和阿登纳一模一样，也有一套奇怪的逻辑。他在去年12月4日的讲话中，把屯兵在德意志民主共和国的心脏说成是为了保卫和平和美国的“安全”。这样说来，为了各国人民的安全，各国政府就应当在华盛顿驻上自己的军队了。
    德国人民从这件事情中进一步认清了，阿登纳是一位德国历史上唯一用自己的全部政策来保护外国对德国的占领的总理，是一位“占领总理”。
    阿登纳出卖民族利益的政策损害了德国人民应有的自尊心。但德国人民也看到：德国历史上第一个工农政权——德意志民主共和国，代表着全德人民的利益，代表着德意志民族的利益。
    阿登纳在西德复活军国主义，不仅遭到社会主义国家的坚决反对，深受纳粹之害的北欧、西欧各国人民，也对希特勒的将军们重登宝座一事表示极大的不安。阿登纳政府在英、法侵略埃及和美、英侵略黎巴嫩、约旦的时候，伪装中立、暗中支持。而在美英帝国主义声名狼籍的时候，西德经济部长东奔西走，企图在亚非地区填补“真空”，实行经济扩张，露骨地表现了帝国主义的面目。但是各国人民看到在德国土地上有着一个强大的爱好和平的德意志民主共和国。以格罗提渥总理为首的民主德国政府代表团正在访问阿拉伯联合共和国和伊拉克，并将访问印度，这无疑将加深德国人民和亚非国家人民的友谊。这也将使各国人民进一步认清，代表全德人民利益的是德意志民主共和国。
