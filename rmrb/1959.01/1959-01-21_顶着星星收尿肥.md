	Collecting Urine Fertilizer Under the Stars

	In our commune (Siqian Town, Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province), there is a female commune member, Zhang Xiuzhen, who is in her sixties and is very active in the work of boiling soil fertilizer.
	To boil soil fertilizer, the first step is to collect human urine. Every morning, she always gets up before dawn, carrying urine jars and braving the cold wind to knock on doors and collect urine from house to house. We can see her knocking on doors one by one, pouring urine bowl by bowl, carrying load after load, and constantly busying herself. One day, I got up a little earlier, the sky was full of stars, and I saw her carrying a heavy load of urine towards the soil fertilizer factory, and after a while, she came out with an empty load again. I stepped forward and said to her, "It's not dawn yet, and people haven't gotten up yet, why do you get up so early?" She said, "It's important to complete the task of boiling soil fertilizer. If I come a little late, someone will forget about boiling soil fertilizer and will throw the urine away, which would be a great pity!"

    顶着星星收尿肥
    我们公社（陕西蒲城县寺前镇）有个六十来岁的女社员张秀珍，担任着熬土化肥的工作，干得非常积极。
    要熬土化肥，首先要搜集人尿。她每天早晨，总是天不亮就起来，担着尿罐，冒着寒风，挨门逐户叫门收尿。只见她一家一家的敲门，一钵一钵的倒，一担一担的挑，来回忙个不停。有一天，我起得早一些，满天都是星星，看到她担着沉重的尿罐，向土化肥厂走去，不一会又担着空担子出来。我走上前去对她说：“天还没有亮，人家又没有起来，你何必起得这样早呢？”她说：“完成熬土化肥的任务要紧。我要是来得稍微迟一点，有人忘了熬土化肥这回事，就会把尿倒掉了，那多可惜！”
