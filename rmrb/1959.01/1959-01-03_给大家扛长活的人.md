The Person Who Carries the Long Load for Everyone
Dai Dajun, Huanghua County Commercial Bureau, Hebei

I pedaled my bicycle along the familiar road, speeding towards the Lüjiaqiao People's Commune. As soon as I entered the village entrance, I was met by five men and two women pulling a large cart full of manure, heading out of the village. Everyone was hunched over, heads down, pulling the ropes taut. Among those pulling the cart, the one steering was large and sturdy, his voice loud and resonant, but the voice was very familiar, as if I had heard it somewhere before. Getting closer, I could see more clearly. He was wearing a faded single grey uniform, the clothes so wet it looked like they had just been pulled out of the water. Who was it? It turned out to be our county party secretary.

Before I could speak, he had already started: "Hey! That's fast! I just heard on the phone that the county committee working group had set off, and you're already here!"

"Secretary Liu," I stopped and said, looking at him with emotion, "How do you still have time to help the commune deliver manure? Aren't you busy with work?"

"Precisely because I'm busy!" he said, pulling hard, "It's busiest during the rush season! Now it's Cold Dew and Frost's Descent, we have to seize the time to plant wheat and harvest the autumn crops! The commune has few livestock, not enough to use, and it's not yet time for mechanization, so we have to have people pull the manure to get it to the fields on time." Before he finished speaking, the cart had already reached me.

"Comrade Dai, you probably don't know! Secretary Liu has been coming to our Lüjiaqiao Commune for the past few days to inspect work. He's always very busy during the day, so he can only hold meetings and reports at night. When he comes, he never idles and always works with us, pulling the cart together!" The Communist Youth League member Guo Xiangxuan said, turning his head with a smile on his face.

I was just about to turn around and walk towards the commune office, preparing to put the bike inside so I could go pull the manure with them. Suddenly, an old man with silver hair walked out of the alley east of the road. He was exactly the Old Niu Uncle that people often called. He had his hands on his hips, as if he was angry at someone, his toothless mouth puckered into a pit, his white beard trembling as he jutted it out. He walked and shouted, "Why are you people so inconsiderate! Secretary Liu works with you during the day, and he still has to work at night! You sleep soundly at night, don't you! Really, you young people only know how to work hard..."

However, despite his shouting, none of the people pulling the cart answered. Perhaps the wind was strong, and the cart was getting more and more energetic, moving further and further away. The old man shielded his eyes from the harsh sunlight with his hand and took a few more steps forward, shouting, "Don't let Secretary Liu pull anymore!..." After a burst of shouting, there was still no response. All that could be heard was the cheerful singing of the young people pulling the cart. After a while, even the singing could not be heard. The cart went far away. The old man stood still, cursing, "Really! Really!..." But when he turned his head to leave, he noticed me, and he said in surprise, "I was so busy chasing the cart that I didn't even see you. Did you see your secretary just now? He pulled for most of the day today, and he still has to do a black shift. I know he's busy with work, never idle day and night, and I'm worried he'll get sick from exhaustion. But look, these young people don't understand anything, alas! Really!" Then, he nodded to himself, "Secretary Liu is really a good man, he's simply carrying the long load for everyone!"

    给大家扛长活的人
    河北黄骅县商业局　戴大钧
    我踏着自行车在熟悉的大道上，向吕家桥人民公社飞奔。刚一进村口，就迎面来了五个男人和两个妇女拉着装满粪土的大车，向村外驶来。每个人都弓着背，低着头，把绳子扯得绷绷紧。拉车的人中，驾辕的人个又大又结实，他说话的嗓门又高又宏亮，但这声音非常熟悉，似乎我在那里听到过。走近了，看得更清楚了。他上身穿着一件褪了色的单灰制服，衣服湿得简直像才从水里捞出来的一样。我当是谁呢，原来是我们的县委书记。
    没有等我开口，他已经开了腔：“嘿！真快！刚在电话上听说县委工作组出发，你就来到啦！”
    “刘书记”，我站住脚步，激动地望着他说：“你怎么还有时间帮助公社里送粪呢？工作不忙吗？”
    “正是忙！”他一面使劲拉，一面回答说：“抢季节最忙！现在是寒露霜降，种麦秋收要抓紧啦！公社里牲口少，不够使唤，也还没有到机器化的时候，就得人拉着送粪，才能把粪按时送到地里去。”他的话还没说完，车已经赶到我面前了。
      “戴同志，你不知道吧！刘书记打从前几天到咱吕家桥公社来检查工作，白天总是很忙，只得夜里才能开会，汇报。他来了，也总不闲着和咱们大伙一起干活，还一块拉大车！”共青团员郭祥轩满脸堆笑的回过头说着，嚷着。
    我刚要转过身来，往公社办公室走，准备把车子放到屋里好一起去拉粪。忽然，从道东胡同里，走出一个银发苍苍的老大爷。他正是人们常叫的老牛叔。只见他两只手叉着腰，像在跟谁生气一样，没有牙的嘴，瘪成了一个坑一鼓一鼓的，白胡子随着一撅一撅的颤动着。他边走边喊：“你们这些人怎么这么不懂事啊！刘书记他白天和你们干活，晚上还要打夜作，你们夜里睡个香甜吧！真是，唉，你们这批小伙子，就光知道楞干……”
    可是，他尽管喊，拉车的人可没有一个答声，也许是风大，车又越走越上劲，越走越远。老大爷用手遮着刺眼的太阳余光，又朝前赶了几步，喊道：“别再让刘书记拉了！……”一阵喊声后，还是没有一点回音。听到的是拉车的青年们爽朗的歌唱声。一会连歌唱声也听不到了。车走远了。老人立着一动不动，诅咒着说：“真是！真是！……”但是当他回转头要走时，才发觉了我，他吃惊的说：“光顾赶车了，连你也没有看见。你刚才看见你们的书记了吗？今天他拉了大半天，还要赶一趟黑，我知道他工作忙，黑天白天也不闲着，心痛怕把他给累病了。可你看，这班年轻人百事不懂，唉！真是！”接着，他又自管自地点着头：“刘书记可真是个好样的，他这简直是给咱们大家扛长活了！”
