    Cao Yu'e is a ticket seller on Route 49 of the No. 2 Bus Depot of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company. When she started working, she made up her mind to treat passengers like her own relatives. Whenever she encounters elderly people, she thinks: If my own parents went out, wouldn't they also hope to receive care from others? An old lady often took her bus to the hospital to visit her sick son. Every time, she treated the old lady as she would her own mother. Soon, the old lady's son was discharged from the hospital, and the old lady made a special effort to wait for her bus. After getting on the bus, the old lady said to her, "My son is well and discharged from the hospital, so I will have fewer opportunities to ride your bus in the future. I hope you will come to my house to visit often." Before getting off the bus, the old lady held her hand tightly, with tears in her eyes, and said, "You treat me just like my own daughter."

    On the bus, pregnant women are not as easily noticed as elderly people and passengers carrying children, and a slight oversight can cause them to be squeezed. Therefore, Cao Yu'e pays special attention to pregnant women. As soon as the bus enters the station, she first pays attention to whether there are any pregnant women among the passengers getting on. If there are, she immediately asks passengers to give up their seats so that pregnant passengers can sit down as soon as they get on. Cao Yu'e also tries her best to make disabled passengers feel warm and cared for on the bus. Once, a blind passenger wanted to go to South Shaanxi Road. Cao Yu'e thought that this place was still two blocks away from the station, and it was raining heavily outside, which would be very difficult for a blind person. It happened to be her time to get off work. Although she didn't have a raincoat and had to attend class in the evening, she finally decided to brave the rain and take the passenger home. When she took the blind passenger home, her clothes were soaked, but she felt very happy in her heart because she thought she had done what she should do.

    汽车上的女儿
    曹玉娥是上海市公共交通公司汽车二场四十九路的售票员。她开始参加工作的时候，就下决心要把乘客当作自己的亲人一样看待。每逢遇到老年人，她就想：要是我自己的父母到外面去，不是也很希望能够得到别人的照顾吗？有一位老太太经常坐她的车去医院看望她生病的儿子，每次她都像对待自己母亲那样照顾这位老太太。不久，老太太的儿子出院了，这位老太太还特地等着坐她的车。上车后，老太太对她说：“儿子病好出院了，今后坐你的车的机会少了，希望你常到我家里来玩。”临下车时，老太太紧握着她的手，含着眼泪说：“你待我真像我的亲女儿一样。”
    汽车上，孕妇就不像老年人和抱小孩的乘客那样容易被人注意，稍一疏忽，就会使她们挨挤。所以，曹玉娥对孕妇特别注意照顾。车子一进站，她先注意上车的乘客中有没有孕妇，如果有，就立刻动员乘客让坐，使乘车的孕妇一上来就能坐下。对残疾乘客，曹玉娥也尽力想办法使他们在车上感到温暖、体贴。有一次，一位双目失明的乘客要去陕西南路，曹玉娥想这地方离站头还有两条马路，外面的雨又下得很大，这对双目失明的人是很困难的。正好是她下班的时候，虽然她没有穿雨衣，而且晚上还要上课，最后还是决定冒雨送这位乘客回去。当她把这位双目失明的乘客送到家时，衣服全淋透了，但她的心中却感到非常高兴，因为她想她做了自己应该做的事。
