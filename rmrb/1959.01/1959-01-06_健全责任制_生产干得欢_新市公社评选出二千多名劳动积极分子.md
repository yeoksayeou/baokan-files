According to Zhejiang Daily news: The Xinshi People's Commune in Deqing County, Zhejiang, has established a tiered, contracted production responsibility system, improved labor inspection and reward systems, regularly conducted summaries and appraisals, and strengthened the commune members' sense of responsibility for improving commune production, resulting in a large number of labor activists.

After the establishment of the Xinshi Commune, it quickly established labor organizations, adjusted farming areas, and brought production onto the right track. However, after the people's commune abolished the "three guarantees and one reward" responsibility system, there were three different opinions on what kind of production responsibility system should be established, and it was not determined in time. Some people advocated establishing a political responsibility system, believing that cadres and the masses now have a high degree of political awareness, and everyone is working selflessly. Relying on the political consciousness of cadres and the masses can complete production tasks. Some people advocated reporting actual expenses and not having a responsibility system, because there is now a lot of large-scale labor cooperation, and establishing a responsibility system can easily create localism, making large-scale cooperation difficult. Some people advocated the need to establish a production responsibility system, believing that the production responsibility system plays a significant role in ensuring the completion of production tasks.

After the autumn harvest and winter planting, the commune party committee, through mass summary appraisals and open discussions, criticized the idea of reporting actual expenses in production, because it had already affected production efficiency and quality. At the same time, regarding the view that commune members' political awareness was already high enough and that it was not necessary to establish a responsibility system, everyone also believed it was incomplete. The unanimous opinion was that after the people's commune was established, the political awareness of commune members had greatly improved, but it was still necessary to continue to carry out political and ideological education for commune members, constantly improve their communist consciousness, and at the same time implement a tiered, contracted responsibility system, so as to ensure that production is done better. After the cadres unified their thinking, they established a production responsibility system that combined the team, group, and commune member, based on the opinions of the masses.

The commune established a planned output responsibility system for production teams. According to the labor force and cultivated land of each production team, the area of ​​planted crops was stipulated, corresponding production costs were allocated, financial contracts were implemented, and the planned output that must be completed was stipulated. This was the production responsibility system for the production team. The production team established a work quota responsibility system for production groups and professional groups. According to the production plan, the production team reasonably assigned temporary production tasks and crop professional management responsibilities to the subordinate production groups and professional labor organizations. This was the work quota that the production group or professional group must complete. The production team established a labor quota responsibility system for commune members. The current management level cannot fully register and calculate the quantity and quality of work completed by each commune member. It can only appraise the completion of labor quotas by combining the commune member's labor attendance, general labor quantity, quality, and labor attitude.

In order to ensure the implementation of the production responsibility system, corresponding organizations and systems were also established. 1. The commune and brigade established a labor quota management committee, and the production team established a labor quota management group, specializing in the implementation of the production responsibility system. 2. Conduct monthly red flag competition summaries, combine appraisals, and assess the completion of production tasks and labor quotas by production teams, groups, and commune members, and select advanced teams, groups, and commune members. 3. Commune members established a labor attendance system. The commune members’ attendance, absence, and absenteeism are recorded daily. The commune members’ work attitude and completion of quotas are evaluated every ten days for minor reviews and monthly for major reviews. Commune members with the most attendance and the best work attitude are selected as actively working commune members.

At the same time, they also decided to issue bonus wages to replace the "three guarantees and one reward" system. It is stipulated that bonus wages account for 20% of the total wages, of which the commune controls 30%, the brigade controls 20%, and the production team controls 50%. The production team’s bonus wages are awarded monthly to the commune members of the selected advanced groups and actively working commune members. The brigade’s bonus wages, combined with the red flag competition, serve as collective bonus wages for advanced production teams. These bonus wages are all issued to the commune members and cannot be used for other purposes. The commune’s bonus wages are mainly used to reward production teams that have overfulfilled their planned output, combined with rewarding advanced units and commune members who have made outstanding achievements.

After this method was implemented, it was welcomed by cadres and commune members. The commune members' labor enthusiasm has been significantly improved, and their sense of responsibility has also been greatly strengthened. Recently, the commune party committee has combined the distribution of wages with the first major appraisal, selecting 2,361 actively working commune members and advanced workers, greatly promoting the communist labor spirit and enhancing the sense of ownership of the vast number of commune members.

    健全责任制　生产干得欢
    新市公社评选出二千多名劳动积极分子
    据浙江日报消息　浙江德清县新市人民公社建立分层包干的生产责任制，健全劳动检查和评奖制度，定期进行总结评比，加强了社员对于搞好公社生产的责任心，涌现了大批劳动积极分子。
    新市公社建立以后，迅速地建立了劳动组织，调整了耕作区，使生产初步走上正轨。但是，对人民公社取消了“三包一奖”的责任制之后，以建立怎样的生产责任制为宜，有三种分歧的意见，未及时确定下来。一种人主张建立政治责任制，认为现在干部、群众的政治觉悟很高，大家都在忘我地劳动，依靠干部和群众的政治自觉性就可以完成生产任务；一种人主张实报实销，不要责任制，因为现在劳动大协作搞得很多，建立责任制容易产生本位主义思想，搞大协作有困难；一种人主张需要建立生产责任制，认为生产责任制对于保证完成生产任务有很大的作用。
    公社党委在秋收冬种结束之后，通过群众性的总结评比和鸣放辩论，批判了生产上的实报实销思想，因为它已经影响了生产效率和质量。同时，对于认为社员的政治觉悟已经很高，可以不必建立责任制了的看法，大家也认为是不全面的。一致的意见是：人民公社化以后，社员的政治觉悟有了很大提高，但是还需要继续向社员进行政治思想教育，不断提高他们的共产主义觉悟，同时也要实行分层包干的责任制，这样才能保证把生产搞得更好。干部思想统一以后，就根据群众的意见，建立了队、组和社员三者结合的生产责任制。
    公社对生产队建立计划产量责任制。根据各个生产队劳力和耕种的土地，规定种植作物面积，拨给相应的生产成本，实行财务包干，规定必须完成的计划产量，这是生产队的生产责任制。生产队对生产组和专业小组建立工作定额责任制。生产队对所属生产组和专业劳动组织，根据生产计划，合理分给临时生产任务和作物专业管理责任。这是生产组或专业小组必须完成的工作定额。生产队对社员建立劳动定额责任制。现有的管理水平，还不可能把每个社员完成的工作数量和质量全部登记和计算出来，只能根据社员的劳动出勤、一般的劳动数量、质量和劳动态度，三者结合起来鉴定社员完成劳动定额的情况。
    为了保证生产责任制度的贯彻执行，还建立了相应的组织和制度。1、公社、大队建立劳动定额管理委员会，生产队建立劳动定额管理小组，专管生产责任制度的贯彻执行。2、按月总结红旗竞赛，结合评比，鉴定生产队、组和社员完成生产任务和劳动定额的情况，评出先进的队、组和社员。3、社员建立劳动考勤制度。社员出勤、缺勤和旷工每天登记纪录，社员劳动态度和完成定额好坏，十天一小评，一月一大评。出勤最多、劳动态度最好的社员被评选为积极劳动的社员。
    同时，他们还确定发放奖励工资，代替“三包一奖”制度。规定奖励工资占工资总数的20％，其中公社掌握30％，大队掌握20％，生产队掌握50％。生产队的奖励工资，按月奖给评比出来的先进组的社员，以及积极劳动的社员。大队的奖励工资，结合红旗竞赛，作为先进生产队的集体奖励工资。这些奖励工资都发到社员手里，不能挪作他用。公社的奖励工资，以奖励超额完成计划产量的生产队为主，结合奖励有特出成绩的先进单位和社员。
    这个办法贯彻执行之后，得到了干部和社员的欢迎。社员的劳动积极性有了显著提高，责任心也大大加强了。最近，公社党委已结合发放工资作了第一次大评比，评出积极劳动的社员和先进工作者二千三百六十一名，大大发扬了共产主义劳动精神，提高了广大社员的主人翁思想。（附图片）
