Myriad Flowers in the Machinery Garden
By our correspondent Lu Yin

Like the heroes who captured the "1070," like the peasants who won unprecedented bumper harvests, China's machinery industry workers raised another banner high in the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

Recalling the achievements of the machinery industry over the past year, a dazzling Great Leap Forward picture seems to unfold before us: on the steel base where the sky is lit by blazing fire, large iron smelting furnaces have been built, and the names of the Chinese factories that manufactured them are written on the blast furnace equipment. In modern power plants, large domestically produced generators have been newly installed. Countless newly built machine factories have installed new machine tools produced in China. Look, how many machines have reached and surpassed international standards in the Great Leap Forward! On the turbulent East China Sea, huge freighters and oil tankers newly built in China sail; in the boundless fields, many new cars and tractors appear....

The changes this year have been too great. Even the best statistician would find it difficult to say exactly how many new equipment and machines we have produced. When the earth was just thawing and the agricultural front was engaging in a large-scale water conservancy campaign, the machinery industry workers rushed to produce tens of thousands of sets of irrigation and drainage machinery in a few months and rushed them to rural areas across the country; in early autumn, when the Great Leap Forward tune of "1070" began to play, they invested in the movement to manufacture metallurgical equipment at the fastest speed. Millions of workers on the machinery industry front, in this way, in line with the needs of the national Great Leap Forward, increased the output of metallurgical equipment from more than 12,800 tons in 1957 to 180,000 tons in 1958; power station equipment from more than 197,000 kilowatts to more than one million kilowatts; various power equipment from 690,000 horsepower to 2.5 million horsepower; and machine tools from 28,000 units to more than 90,000 units.

What a huge leap forward this is! During the first five-year plan, China's machinery industry shocked both China and foreign countries with an annual increase of more than 30%. Such a speed was unprecedented at that time. However, compared with the pace of the Great Leap Forward of the machinery industry in 1958, it is far behind.

An instrument expert from a capitalist country, said to be internationally renowned, visited the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory. He looked around this factory with suspicion and asked questions. He didn't believe that China, which was in his impression, could produce such good instruments and machines. However, when he left China, he had to write such a letter to the factory: "Please forgive all the hard-working workers, forgive a scientist who once suspected their hands for praising those sophisticated products..."

This is the story of this spring. At that time, the horn of the Great Leap Forward had just been blown. If he could come to China again now and see the new achievements of our workers' Great Leap Forward in one year, he would be even more surprised.

A year ago, China's production of heavy equipment was still blank in many aspects. But now, we have built a large blast furnace of 1,513 cubic meters, a 700 mm primary rolling mill, a complete set of large-scale high-pressure chemical equipment, a 25,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator, a 60,000 kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator, a complete set of 220,000 volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line equipment, and a free forging hydraulic press with a pressure of 2,500 tons.

It is not difficult to see how significant the successful manufacture of these important equipment, weighing thousands of tons, is. Take the 1,513 cubic meter blast furnace as an example. A year ago, let alone manufacturing it, we had never even seen it. When such a furnace is started, it can produce nearly one million tons of iron a year. Although the 2,500-ton hydraulic press is not very large in the world, when it roars, it can knead the large steel ingot weighing more than 40 tons like dough.

Filling in the blank spots of these heavy equipment has established the foundation; with a foothold, we can stride forward. The fact is true. As soon as the 700 mm primary rolling mill was built, we began to manufacture a 1,150 mm rolling mill that rolls 10,000 tons of steel per day. The 25,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator has generated electricity, and the 50,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator will soon be successfully manufactured. The 2,500-ton free forging hydraulic press is too small for us, and the hydraulic press we are manufacturing has four times the pressure than it, daring to compare with the oldest capitalist country—Britain.

A year ago, it can be said that China had not completely made a tractor, but in 1958, more than 200 kinds were trial-produced in various places. The most powerful "Red Flag" brand tractor has 80 horsepower, and with two five-furrow plows, it can cultivate more than 400 acres of land a day. Large railway electric locomotives and 4,000-horsepower internal combustion locomotives equipped with the latest technology appeared for the first time on China's land. We built freighters with a deadweight of 5,000 tons at the fastest speed, and the ocean-going giant ships with a deadweight of 10,000 tons under construction will soon be officially completed. What is even more precious is that some unknown small factories and some students have actually made several new airplanes.

Before liberation, our country was called the International Automobile Exhibition. At that time, more than 60 brands of automobiles produced in more than 20 countries ran around on our land, but no "Made in China" cars were seen. At the end of the first five-year plan, we established the automobile industry, but the output was still small. 1958 was different. In just a few months, more than 100 kinds of new cars were built in various places. The eye-catching "Red Flag" brand high-end sedan can be compared with the best cars manufactured by capitalist countries.

Machine tools are machines for manufacturing machines and are the material basis for the development of the machinery industry. Nine years ago, this department was simply pitifully weak. In 1949, only 1,500 various machine tools were made in one year. Because there were no machine tools, the old Chinese machinery industry could not make anything. It was like a hen that did not lay eggs, existing in name only. During the first five-year plan, China's machine tool manufacturing industry has changed this backward situation, but the real leap forward development was still the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

In 1958, we not only had a several-fold increase in the number of machine tools, but also made great progress in the development of the production of heavy, precision, automated and high-efficiency machine tools. We not only built a huge gantry planer with a width of three meters and a length of fourteen meters, and a vertical lathe of three point four meters, but even the coordinate boring machine and high-precision gear grinding machine, known as the "king of precision machine tools," were successfully trial-produced this year. The number of countries in the world that can manufacture such precision equipment is very few. These achievements made by the machine tool industry in climbing the world's advanced technology peak will enable China's machinery industry to obtain more and better technical equipment, thereby promoting the machinery industry to leap forward at a faster speed.

Counting these new products, people can't help but ask: What power has made China's machinery industry like a garden in spring, with thousands of flowers blooming and dyeing the land red in a very short time? It is nothing else, like other fronts in our country, this is the result of implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, the victory of carrying out mass movements on the industrial front, and the crystallization of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to advance to the world's latest technology.

Dalian Shipyard is going to build a 10,000-ton ship. This is the prelude to China's shipbuilding industry starting to enter the world's advanced ranks. How inspiring it is. In the beginning, people were brewing to strive for high speed. At that time, a few technicians believed that large ship technology was too complicated, and it would be good for us to be able to build them. The shipbuilding speed could not be compared with that of Britain and Japan. Their opinions were not without reason. Britain has had a history of shipbuilding for more than 100 years, and Japan is currently the country with the fastest shipbuilding speed in the world. How can a factory that has just learned to build large ships compare with them? However, the Party committee found the best shipbuilding engineers, mobilized the workers of the whole factory, let everyone speak out freely, and everyone insisted on "surpassing Britain and pressing Japan" in speed. The masses solved the difficulties raised by the technicians one by one. What was the result? The result was that it only took 58 days from the start of construction on the slipway to the completion and launching of the hull of this giant ship. The slipway cycle was shortened by four months compared with the United Kingdom and by one month compared with Japan.

Electronically Computer Program Controlled Milling Machine, what a novel name. As long as you see that it does not require workers to manage it at all during processing, you will know how brilliant it is. This is the latest technology in the world. Only a few countries in the world have made this machine tool in recent years. However, this cutting-edge technology was broken through by the teachers and students of Tsinghua University and the workers of the Beijing Machine Tool Factory in cooperation during the Great Leap Forward. When they were trial-producing this machine tool, because there were no reference materials, they relied entirely on hard thinking, revised the design more than ten times, and experimented dozens of times before succeeding. What power gave them unparalleled wisdom and perseverance? Just like their representative said at the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists, this is the Party's encouragement and support, and the confidence in the highly automated communist future of our country.

These are just two examples of millions of people. It is these people who have made miracles in our machinery industry in one year that we never dared to think of in the past. Facts have proved that with the leadership of the Party, with such people who dare to think and dare to act, with a vigorous mass movement, and with the experience of the great Soviet Union as a reference, no force can stop the high-speed progress of China's machinery industry!

1958 has passed, and our country will see a greater leap forward in the new year. China's agricultural front needs more machines, and 18 million tons of steel must be made into useful materials, all of which put forward more arduous and glorious tasks to the machinery industry workers. At this time of saying goodbye to the old and welcoming the new, we pay tribute to the heroes on the machinery industry front who have already made great achievements. We wish that in the new year, the flowers in the machine garden you have cultivated with your own hands will bloom more and more beautifully! (Attached picture)

    机械园里万花红
    本报记者  鲁音
    像夺下“一○七○”的英雄，像争得空前丰产的农民，我国机械工业职工在1958年的大跃进中，高高地举起了另一面帅旗。
    回忆一年来机械工业的成就，我们面前仿佛展开了一幅绚丽夺目的跃进图：在火光烛天的钢铁基地上，建起了大炼铁炉，高炉设备上写着制造它们的中国工厂的名字。在现代化的发电厂里，新安装上了国产的大型发电机。数不清的新建机器厂安上了我国出产的新机床。看，有多少机器在大跃进中达到和超过了国际水平！那波浪滔天的东海面上，驶来了我国新造的巨大的货轮和油轮；在一望无际的田野里，出现了许多新的汽车和拖拉机……。
    这一年中，变化实在太大了。就是那最好的统计家，也很难确切地说出我们到底造出了多少新设备和新机器。当大地刚刚解冻、农业战线上大闹水利运动的时候，机械工业职工就在几个月里突击赶制出了成千上万套排灌机械，赶运到各地农村；初秋，“一○七○”的跃进曲奏起来了，他们又以最快的速度投入了制造冶炼设备的运动。机械工业战线上几百万职工，就是这样，随着全国跃进的需要，在一年里就把冶金设备的产量由1957年的一万二千八百多吨提高到1958年的十八万吨；电站设备由十九万七千多瓩，提高到一百多万瓩；各种动力设备由六十九万马力提高到二百五十万马力；机床由二万八千台提高到九万台以上。
    这是一个多么巨大的飞跃！在第一个五年计划期间，我国机械工业曾以每年递增30％以上的速度震惊过中外。这样的速度在当时来说，确是空前的。但是，这同1958年机械工业的跃进步伐比较起来，那就望尘莫及了。
    一位来自资本主义国家的据说是国际闻名的仪表专家，访问了哈尔滨电表仪器厂。他在这个厂里充满了怀疑地看这问那。他不相信，那个在他印象里的中国，竟能生产出这么好的仪表和机器。可是，在他离开中国的时候，他不得不给工厂写来这么一封信：“请各位辛勤劳动的工人们原谅，原谅一个科学家曾因赞扬那些精密的产品而怀疑了他们的双手……”
    这是今年春天的故事。那时，大跃进的号角还刚刚吹起。如果现在他能再来中国看看，看看我国工人一年跃进的新成就，就会使他更加惊奇。
    一年以前，我国重型设备的生产，在许多方面还是空白。但是现在，我们已经造出了一千五百十三立方公尺的大高炉，七百公厘的初轧机，全套大型高压化工设备，二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机，六万瓩的水轮发电机，二十二万伏超高压输电线路全套设备，以及压力为二千五百吨的自由锻造水压机。
    不难看出，这些重达几千几百吨的重要设备的制造成功，有着多么重大的意义。就拿那座一千五百一十三立方公尺的高炉来说，一年前不要说我们不能制造，就是见也没有见过。这样一座炉子开动起来，一年就可炼铁近百万吨。那台二千五百吨水压机，在世界上说来虽然不算很大，但是它吼动起来，也可以使那四十多吨重的大钢锭，像面团一样被揉来揉去。
    补上了这些重型设备的空白点，这就建立了基础；有了立脚点，我们就可以大踏步地向前迈进。事实正是如此，七百公厘的初轧机刚刚造出，我们就开始制造日轧万吨钢的一千一百五十公厘的轧钢机。二万五千瓩汽轮发电机发电了，五万瓩的汽轮发电机又将制造成功。二千五百吨自由锻造水压机对我们来说还太小，我们正在制造的水压机压力要比它大四倍，敢同那资格最老的资本主义国家——英国相比。
    一年以前，我国可以说没有完整地做过一台拖拉机，而1958年，各地却试制成了二百多种。功率最大的“红旗”牌拖拉机有八十马力，给它带上两个五铧犁，一天能耕四百多亩地。在我国的土地上还第一次出现了装备着最新技术的大型铁路电气机车和功率为四千马力的内燃机车，我们用最快的速度造出了载重五千吨的货轮，正在建造的载重万吨的远洋巨轮，不久也将正式建成。更珍奇的是一些不出名的小工厂和一些学生，竟然造出了好几种新飞机。
    解放以前，我们的国家曾被称为国际汽车博览会，那时二十多个国家出产的六十多种牌号的汽车，在我们的土地上跑来跑去，就是不见“中国造”。第一个五年计划末期，我们建立了汽车工业，但是产量还不多。1958年不同了。在短短的几个月里，各地就造出了一百多种新汽车。那引人注意的“红旗”牌高级小轿车，可以同资本主义国家制造的最好的汽车相媲美。
    机床是制造机器的机器，是发展机械工业的物质基础。九年以前，这个部门简直薄弱得可怜，1949年一年才不过做出各种机床一千五百台。因为没有机床，旧中国的机械工业什么也造不出来，它就像一只不生蛋的母鸡，有名无实。在第一个五年计划期间，我国的机床制造业已经改变了这种落后的面貌，但是真正突飞猛进的发展，还是1958年的大跃进。
    1958年，我们不但在机床的数量上有了几倍的增长，在发展重型、精密和自动化高效率机床的生产方面，也都取得了长足的进步。我们不但造出了三公尺宽、十四公尺长巨大的龙门刨床，三点四公尺的立式车床，就连那被称为“精密机床之王”的座标镗床和高精度齿轮磨床，今年也都试制成功了。世界上能够制造这种精密设备的国家是屈指可数的。机床工业在攀登世界先进技术高峰中取得的这些成就，将使我国机械工业得到更多更好的技术装备，从而推动机械工业以更快的速度向前跃进。
    历数着这些新的产品，人们不禁要问：是什么力量使得我国的机械工业像春天的花园，千万朵鲜花在很短的时间里就染红了大地？不是别的，同我国其他战线一样，这是贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线的结果，是在工业战线上大搞群众运动的胜利，是敢想、敢干、敢于向世界最新技术前进的结晶。
    大连造船厂要造万吨级轮船了。这是我国造船工业开始进入世界先进行列的先声，它是多么鼓舞人心。一开始人们就酝酿着要争取高速度，那时有少数技术人员认为，大船技术太复杂，我们能造就不错了，造船速度不可能同英国和日本去较量。他们的意见不是没有道理，英国造船已有一百多年的历史，日本是目前世界上造船速度最快的国家，一个刚学造大船的厂子，怎么敢同它们相比？可是党委找到了最好的造船工程师，它把全厂的工人发动起来，大鸣大放，大家坚持一定要在速度上“超英国，压日本”，群众把技术人员提出的困难一个个地解决了。结果怎么样？结果是这艘巨轮从铺上船台开工建造到船体建完下水，只用了五十八天的时间。船台周期比英国缩短了四个月，比日本缩短了一个月。
    电子计算机程序控制铣床，这是多么新奇的名字。只要看到它在加工时根本无需工人管理，你就会知道它是多么高明。这是世界上最新的技术，最近几年世界上只有几个国家制成了这种机床。可是，就是这项尖端技术，在大跃进中却在清华大学的师生和北京机床厂的工人协作下被攻破了。他们在试制这种机床时，因为没有参考资料，全凭苦思苦想，前后曾修改了十几次设计，试验了几十次才成功。是什么力量给了他们无比的智慧和毅力？就像他们的代表在全国社会主义建设青年积极分子大会上所说的，这是党的鼓舞和支持，是对我国高度自动化的共产主义远景的信心。
    这不过是千百万人中的两个例子。就是这些人使得我们的机械工业在一年间就出现了过去想都不敢想的奇迹。事实证明，有了党的领导，有了这样的敢想敢干的人，有了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，有了伟大苏联的经验作借鉴，任何力量都不能阻止我国机械工业高速度地前进！
    1958年已经过去了，在新的一年里我们的国家将要出现更大的跃进。我国农业战线需要更多的机器，一千八百万吨钢要成材成器，这一切都向机械工业职工提出了更为艰巨的光荣任务。在这辞旧迎新的时候，我们向已经作出了巨大成就的机械工业战线上的英雄们致敬，我们预祝在新的一年，你们亲手开垦的机器园地里的鲜花开得更多、更美丽！（附图片）
