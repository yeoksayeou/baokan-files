    Poisoning Expert Talks About Hygiene
    Poem by Li Xu, Illustration by Ying Tao

    It is reported that the American lunar rocket was "disinfected so as not to contaminate the moon" before launch. They favor rats and flies, launch germ warfare, speak of benevolence and morality but secretly spread diseases. When it comes to thermonuclear weapons, they are even more active in spreading poison, refusing to stop testing at all costs. Poison gas fills their entire body, yet they talk about hygiene; the rocket hasn't even been launched, but the disinfection work is serious. The number one strange news in the world: afraid of soiling the lunar palace, a fine poisoning expert, how can he act so upright! Disinfection is really superfluous, the rocket will hardly reach the sky, water burial and cremation are all prepared, disinfected without a trace!

    放毒专家讲卫生
    李旭诗　英韬画
    有消息说，美国的月球火箭在发射前，“为了不致沾染了月球，都是消过毒的”。偏爱老鼠苍蝇，发动细菌战争，嘴上仁义道德，暗地传播疾病。说到热核武器，放毒更加积极，要他停止试验，拼死拼活拒绝。毒气充满全身，居然来讲卫生，火箭未曾发射，消毒工作认真。天下第一奇闻：怕把月宫污损，好个放毒专家，亏他装得正经！消毒实在多余，火箭难上天宇，水葬火葬齐备，消得踪影全无！
