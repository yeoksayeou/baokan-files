Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 26th. Former President of Mexico and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, General Lázaro Cárdenas, and his entourage, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, arrived in Guangzhou today from Wuhan on a special plane. Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace stationed in Guangzhou, and Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Vice-Chairmen Zhu Guang and Du Guoxiang, were all at the airport to welcome the distinguished guests.

This afternoon, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Zhu Guang, and others, visited the Xin Jiao People's Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou. After visiting the commune's public canteen, nursery, and agricultural machinery factory, and hearing Liang Jinghong, the commune's director, introduce the commune's production, living, and welfare conditions since its establishment, General Cárdenas praised the commune, saying: "It is not easy for your commune to do so much in such a short period of time since its establishment. This is not only because the land here is fertile, but mainly because the farmers have confidence in the People's Commune, and the production management work is also well done." He left the commune with the inscription: "This commune proves what the people can achieve after the labor force is organized. Today, we are very happy to see the achievements of this commune and see that everyone in this commune demonstrates their wisdom and patriotism for their motherland."

The distinguished guests then visited the China Export Commodities Fair.

In the evening, Guo Moruo held a banquet to bid farewell to the distinguished Mexican guests who are about to leave our country. In his speech, Guo Moruo expressed his gratitude for the visit of General Cárdenas and other distinguished Mexican guests. He said: "The visit of General Cárdenas and other friends has brought the profound friendship of the Mexican people, and we hope that they will also take back the friendship of the Chinese people. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Mexican people, strengthened by this visit of distinguished guests, can never be separated. We are willing to join hands closely with the Mexican people to safeguard peace in the Pacific Ocean, to make the Pacific Ocean a Pacific Ocean in the true sense of the word, and we are willing to work with the Mexican people to make unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace." During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently toasted to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Mexican people. Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and heads of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City branches, attended the banquet.
