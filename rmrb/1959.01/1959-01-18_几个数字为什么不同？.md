    Why are some numbers different?
    In the news article "British Gamble Decides on Free Convertibility of the Pound" on page 5 of the People's Daily on December 30th, it was mentioned that West Germany currently has nearly four billion US dollars in reserves, while France has less than two hundred million US dollars. This news regarding West Germany's US dollar reserve figure differs from the nearly six billion US dollars in gold and US dollar reserves of West Germany mentioned in the commentary "Devaluation of the Franc and its Consequences" written by Comrade Lin Sheng on the same day and same page; the figure for France's US dollar reserves also differs from the four to six hundred million US dollars in gold and US dollar reserves that France currently has, as stated in the Xinhua News Agency's Paris dispatch on page 6 on December 29th. I don't know which is correct?

    The news "British Gamble Decides on Free Convertibility of the Pound" only mentioned the US dollar reserves of West Germany and France. The commentary written by Comrade Lin Sheng and the Xinhua News Agency's Paris dispatch on the 27th mentioned not only the US dollar reserves of West Germany and France but also included gold reserves. These figures are all correct.

    几个数字为什么不同？
    人民日报12月30日第五版上“英国冒险决定英镑自由兑换”新闻中，提到西德目前美元储备将近四十亿美元，法国不足二亿美元。这一新闻关于西德美元储备数字，与同一日同一版林生同志写的述评“法郎贬值及其后果”中所说西德的黄金美元储备将近六十亿美元不同；关于法国美元储备数字，与12月29日第六版新华社巴黎电所说法国目前仅有四亿至六亿美元的黄金美元储备的数字也不同。不知道哪个正确？

    “英国冒险决定英镑自由兑换”新闻中提的仅仅是西德、法国的美元储备，林生同志写的述评和新华社巴黎27日电中提及的不仅是西德和法国的美元储备，还加上黄金储备。这几个数字都是正确的。
