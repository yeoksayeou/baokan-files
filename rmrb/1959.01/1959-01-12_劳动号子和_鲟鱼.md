Labor Call and "Sturgeon"
　　Wang Jing

　　A year ago, I sent a friend to the countryside for training. She was a singer who had never been to the countryside. She was very happy when her application was approved; but she also had concerns, fearing that labor would affect her professional development. However, before leaving, she stated: In order to gain labor experience, sacrificing art is something to be accepted.

　　A few days ago, we welcomed this friend back from her training. While discussing her ideological gains, we asked how much "sacrifice" she had made in art. She laughed heartily and said, "Let me sing one for you first."

　　Our friend is a "lyrical soprano," famous for singing Schubert and Tchaikovsky's romances, but this time she abandoned her past stage demeanor, standing tall and singing a labor call from Jiangnan for us. The opening solo part was sonorous and beautiful, with very moving subtle changes in the long-drawn-out melody; the following harmony part was a jumping rhythm, an exciting melody, which made the listeners unconsciously move along with it.

　　"You have broadened my horizons," a friend said, "I have never heard such a moving labor song. In the past, I always thought that calls, mountain songs, and the like were primitive shouts, without any 'artistic quality'..."

　　"I thought the same when I first went down," the vocalist interjected, "I always thought that labor and art were mutually exclusive. Not to mention learning to sing labor calls, I was even prepared to give up my original repertoire. I once thought: In the past, living in urban conditions, I often caught colds and had congested vocal cords, requiring medicine, steam inhalation, and rest every few days. So, under the conditions of busy labor in the countryside, what could I say about art! ... To be honest, I was once very distressed for a while.”

　　"How did you change?"

　　"Ha, there is no dramatic plot here, it's very ordinary, very natural -- it was in the spring, during rice transplanting, the sound of labor calls was everywhere in the mountains and fields. What particularly surprised me was the women. They sang from morning till night, standing, walking, and bending over, constantly, and without hoarse voices or 'tone deafness.' I felt that many of them were even better than professional singers like me. At first, I was stunned by this situation. With my education, I felt it was inexplicable, and I didn't know what attitude to take. But, I didn't come to study problems, I came to participate in productive labor. After I worked with everyone for a few days, I couldn't help but be inspired by the enthusiasm of the collective singing. I temporarily forgot about my vocal cord vibration state and resonance position and sang along with everyone. At first, I felt uncomfortable and unaccustomed, but after a while, I sang as loud as they did, and I never got hoarse again."

　　"Did this have any impact on your original singing style?" someone asked her.

　　She didn't answer, she sat down at the piano and sang a song she was good at, "Sturgeon". This was still the very familiar sound to us, the difference was (at least my feeling was) that the timbre was brighter than before, like shining with a metallic luster; at the same time, her singing method of the jumping melody in this famous song naturally reminded people of the harmony part of the labor call she sang at the beginning. Hearing everyone's approving laughter, she felt there was no need to add any explanation.

　　"The key issue is to liberate the mind," she said to everyone as if making a summary, "In the past, when I was in school, I heard my teacher say that 'shouting folk songs' (my teacher never said 'singing folk songs') was contrary to 'scientific vocalization' and would break the voice, leading to all previous efforts being wasted. When we mentioned folk singing, we were almost terrified, and no one dared to try it. This is a superstition! Past education also instilled in me such a view: Art is a special, sacred career, ordinary workers have no connection with it, and artists should not participate in physical labor, it is said that this will make muscles stiff and brains dull...etc. This is also an absurd superstition! But in the past, we deeply believed it, and now looking back, it feels so funny!"

　　"What deep prejudices!" a friend added with emotion, "Art originally originated from labor, and the masters of art were originally the workers, but thousands of years of class society have formed a deep-rooted historical prejudice, putting art in opposition to labor, and putting artists in opposition to the working people. In the past, we thought we were Marxists-Leninists, believing that a communist society would be realized, but in artistic views (as a part of the worldview) we were superstitious about this prejudice of the ruling class. How can this be a true communist!"

　　"Naturally, a communist society is our highest ideal," another friend continued to elaborate, "Communist art is certainly not returning to the state of primitive communes, but to inherit the labor results of mankind for thousands of years. I think that professional art still needs to be developed, and the exercise of professional skills is still an important issue in our art education, but breaking superstitions and liberating the mind is indeed the key, otherwise we will lose our way. As an audience, I hope to see both programs that express the thoughts and feelings of the people and have more professional artistic processing, like our singer, and also lively programs created by the masses themselves and constantly improving. This is also one aspect of the meaning of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom,' right."

　　Everyone looked at our singer with hopeful eyes. Her face showed an excited blush, as if she heard the urging bell and was about to come on stage and meet the audience.

    劳动号子和“鲟鱼”
    王静
    一年前，送一个朋友下放锻炼。她是个歌唱家，从来没有下过乡。当申请被批准后她很高兴；但也有顾虑，怕劳动影响了她的专业进修。不过她行前表示：为了劳动锻炼，牺牲艺术也在所不惜。
    前几天我们欢迎这个朋友锻炼归来，谈到思想收获之余，问她在艺术上作了多大的“牺牲”。她爽朗地笑了，说：“你们先听我唱一个吧。”
    我们的这位朋友是“抒情的女高音”，以演唱舒伯特和柴可夫斯基的浪漫曲出名，但这次却一反过去的舞台风度，昂首挺胸，对我们唱起一首江南的劳动号子。开始的领唱部分高昂而又清丽，绵延的音调中有着十分动人的细微变化；后面和唱部分则是一种跳跃的节奏，激荡的旋律，使听者不觉都跟着动起来了。
    “你扩大了我的眼界”，一个朋友说，“我从来没听过这么动人的劳动歌声。过去我总以为号子、山歌之类都是原始的呼喊，没有什么‘艺术性’的”……
      “我刚下去时也是这样看的”，声乐家抢过去说，“总以为劳动与艺术不可得兼，不用说去学唱号子，连我原来的一套也准备放弃的呢。我曾想：过去在城市的生活条件下，还常常感冒，声带充血，要三天两头地吃药，呵蒸气、静养，那末在农村繁忙劳动的条件下，还谈什么艺术呢！……老实说，我曾经很苦恼了一阵子。”
    “你又是怎样转变的呢？”
    “哈，这里并没有什么戏剧性的情节，很平常，很自然——那是在春天，插秧的时候，满山遍野都是吆号子的声音，特别使我惊奇的是妇女，她们从早到晚，站着、走着、弯着腰，总是在唱，从不停歇，而且没有哑嗓子，没有‘音盲’。我觉得，她们中间有很多人比我这样的专业演唱家还要出色。一开始我被这种情况弄得目瞪口呆，以我所受的教养觉得这是不可解释的，我不知道该采取什么态度才好。但是，我不是来研究问题的，是来参加生产劳动的，当我和大家一起工作了几天以后，就抑制不住被那集体歌唱所激发的热情，也暂时忘掉了我的声带振动状态和共鸣位置，随着大家高唱起来。开头几天觉得不大舒服，不大习惯，但过些时候我就和她们唱得一样嘹亮，而且也再没哑过。”
      “这对你原来的歌唱风格有没有影响呢？”有人这样问她。
    她没有回答，坐到钢琴旁唱了一曲她拿手的“鲟鱼”。这仍是我们非常熟悉的声音，不同的是（至少我的感觉是）音色比从前更明亮，像发着金属的光泽；同时，她对这首名曲中跳跃的旋律的唱法，令人很自然地联想到她开头唱的那首号子的和唱部分。听到大家赞许的笑声，她觉得再不需要加什么说明了。
    “关键问题在于解放思想”，她像做总结似地向大家说，“过去我在学校里的时候，听老师教导说‘喊民歌’（我的老师从来不说‘唱民歌’）是和‘科学的发声法’矛盾的，会把嗓子喊破，以至前功尽弃。我们一提到民间歌唱简直有些谈虎色变的样子，从来没有谁敢于尝试过。这是一种迷信！过去的教养还灌输我一种这样的看法：艺术是一种特殊的、神圣的事业，普通劳动者与她无缘，而艺术家也不应该参加体力劳动，据说这样会使得肌肉僵直，脑筋迟钝……云云。这也是一种荒诞的迷信！但过去我们是深信不疑的，现在回头来看觉得多么好笑！”
    “多么深的成见啊！”一个朋友感慨地补充说，“艺术本来是从劳动中产生的，艺术的主人本来是劳动者，但几千年的阶级社会形成一种根深蒂固的历史偏见，把艺术和劳动对立起来，把艺术家和劳动人民对立起来。过去我们以为自己是马列主义者，是相信共产主义社会要实现的，但在艺术观点（作为世界观的一个部分）上却迷信这种统治阶级的偏见，这哪里是真正的共产主义者！”
    “自然，共产主义社会是我们最高的理想”，另一个朋友接着发挥下去，“共产主义的艺术当然不是回复到原始公社时的样子，而是要继承几千年来人类的劳动成果。我想，专业性的艺术还是要得到发展的，专业技巧的锻炼还是我们艺术教育中的重要问题，但破除迷信、解放思想的确是个关键，否则就会迷失方向。作为一个观众，我希望既能看到像我们的歌唱家这样表达了人民的思想感情，又有较多专业性的艺术加工的节目，同时也能看到群众自己创造，并且在不断提高着的生动活泼的节目。这也是‘百花齐放’的一方面的涵义吧。”
    大家不约而同地以期望的眼色看着我们的歌唱家。她脸上现出兴奋的红光，仿佛听到催场的铃声，就要出台和观众见面了。
