Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: In 1958, China's crops achieved an all-round Great Leap Forward and a magnificent bumper harvest. Armed with the general line of socialist construction, China's 500 million farmers, after a year of heroic struggle, have begun to change the face of China's agricultural production and have found a way to develop agricultural production at high speed.

The total output of grain in the country reached about 750 billion jin this year, more than double that of 1957. That is an increase of about 380 billion jin in one year, more than double the total increase in the previous five years (180 billion jin). The proportion of output growth of various grain crops was higher each season than the last. Wheat, which took the lead in the Great Leap Forward, had a total output of 80 billion jin, an increase of nearly 70% over 1957. Rice surpassed wheat again, with a total output of about 300 billion jin, a sharp increase of about 73% over 1957. The leap in miscellaneous grains and tuber crops was even greater. Compared with the total output in 1957, corn increased by 110%, millet increased by 75%, and tuber crops increased by 334%.

The total output of cotton in the country reached about 67 million dan, also more than double that of 1957. An increase of 34 million dan in one year, which is much more than the total increase in the previous five years.

Calculated according to the oil extraction rate and oil yield of previous years, edible vegetable oil is expected to increase by about 50% compared with 1957. Among oil crops, rapeseed reached 27.69 million dan, an increase of 56% over 1957, soybeans increased by 19%, peanuts increased by more than 90%, and sesame increased by more than 70%. The output of other industrial raw material crops has also increased at an unusually high rate: flue-cured tobacco increased by more than 150%, sugarcane and sugar beet increased by more than 100%, and hemp, silk, tea, and fruits also increased by 20%, 30%, and 40% respectively.

Large-scale high yields and large increases in unit output are the main characteristics of the agricultural leap forward in 1958. The sown area of grain crops was about 1.8 billion mu, with an average yield of about 410 jin per mu, more than double the yield of 204 jin per mu in 1957. The vast majority of areas in the country have already achieved the grain and cotton yield targets per mu stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft)" to be reached in 1967. The total area of ​​grain crops (excluding tuber crops) with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu in the country reached 160 million mu, equivalent to one-tenth of the sown area of ​​grain crops (excluding tuber crops), a sharp increase of more than 100 times compared with the 1,000-jin mu in 1957. Several rice thousand-jin provinces, hundreds of rice, corn, millet thousand-jin counties, double thousand-jin counties, hundred-jin ginned cotton counties, double hundred-jin ginned cotton counties, and even three-hundred-jin ginned cotton counties have emerged across the country.

Changing low yields into high yields, and making high yields even higher, is another characteristic of the agricultural leap forward this year. Low-yield areas that have always been cultivated extensively and have low yields, such as Yulin and Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, and Yanbei and Jin Northwest in Shanxi, have seen grain crop yields per mu increase from dozens of jin or more than a hundred jin in previous years to several times, dozens of times, or even dozens of times, becoming the peak of grain production increase in the country. Many high-yield areas have also seen significant increases this year.

The all-round bumper harvest of crops in 1958 has significant economic significance, political impact, and scientific value. Calculated per capita, the current annual grain possession per person in China has reached as high as about 1,200 jin, cotton has reached more than 10 jin, and edible vegetable oil is expected to increase by about half compared with last year. This amazing achievement once again eloquently proves the great vitality and unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. And it powerfully refuted the pessimistic view that agricultural production can only "come slowly" and can only increase by a few percent. The agricultural Great Leap Forward also pointed out a way to develop agricultural production at high speed, that is: to carry out the movement of large-scale, high-yield and bumper harvest fields, earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and cultivate garden-like fields; to change shallow and extensive cultivation with extensive planting and low yields to deep and intensive cultivation with less planting and more yields; through the movement of large-scale, high-yield and bumper harvest fields, to lay the foundation for gradually reducing the existing arable land for crops to, for example, about one-third, and then, the great ideal of Chairman Mao's land-gardening will be gradually realized. In addition, this great achievement has also promoted the development of agricultural science. The "Eight-Character Constitution" for water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, protection, engineering, and management created by the masses is the crystallization of the combination of practice and theory in this year's agricultural Great Leap Forward.

The main reasons for achieving the bumper harvest in agriculture in 1958 were: implementing political command, following the mass line, and comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture. Winter wheat and spring wheat encountered varying degrees of drought during sowing. Wheat in the north also suffered several late frost damage, and wheat stripe rust was also severely prevalent in the south. Rice and miscellaneous grains also encountered varying degrees of natural disasters during their growing period. However, as the Party's general line became more and more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the enthusiasm of the peasants also became greater and greater. Therefore, not only were these disasters conquered, but also the wave of increased production rose higher each season.

    政治挂帅、群众路线、“八字宪法”的胜利
    农业战线五谷丰登
    新华社31日讯　1958年，我国农作物获得了全面大跃进、五谷大丰登的辉煌成绩。在社会主义建设总路线武装下的我国五亿农民，经过这一年的英勇奋战，已经开始改变了我国农业生产的面貌，并且找出了一条高速度发展农业生产的道路。
    全国粮食的总产量在这一年达到了七千五百亿斤左右，比1957年增产一倍还多一点，就是一年增加三千八百亿斤左右，比前五年增产的总和（一千八百亿斤）还多一倍以上。各类粮食作物产量增长的比例，一季比一季高。带头跃进的小麦，总产量达八百亿斤，比1957年增产近七成。水稻又超过小麦，总产量达三千亿斤左右，比1957年猛增73％左右。杂粮和薯类作物的跃进幅度更大，和1957年的总产量相比：玉米增长110％，谷子增长75％，薯类增长334％。
    全国棉花的总产量达六千七百万担左右，比1957年也翻了一番多一点，一年增产三千四百万担，比前五年增产的总和也多得多。
    油料作物按照往年的供榨率和出油率计算，食用植物油预计比1957年可增产50％左右。油料作物中，油菜籽达二千七百六十九万担，比1957年增产56％，大豆增产19％，花生增产90％以上，芝麻增产70％以上。其他工业原料作物的产量也都有少见的高幅度的增长：烤烟猛增一倍半以上，甘蔗和甜菜增产一倍多，麻类、蚕丝、茶叶和水果也分别增产两成、三成、四成。
    大面积丰产、单位产量增长的幅度大，是1958年农业跃进形势的主要特点。粮食作物播种面积十八亿亩左右，平均亩产四百一十斤左右，比1957年亩产二百零四斤高出一倍还多一点。全国绝大部分地区已经提前实现了“全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”所规定要在1967年达到的粮、棉亩产指标。全国粮食作物
  （不包括薯类）亩产千斤以上的面积共达一亿六千万亩，相当于粮食作物播种面积（也不包括薯类）的十分之一，比1957年的千斤亩猛增了一百多倍。全国已经出现了好几个水稻千斤省，好几百个水稻、玉米、谷子的千斤县、双千斤县和百斤皮棉县、双百斤皮棉县、以至三百斤皮棉县。
    低产变高产、高产更高产，是这一年农业跃进形势的另一个特点。一向耕作粗放、产量较低的低产区，如陕北的榆林和延安，山西的雁北和晋西北等地区，粮食作物亩产都从往年的几十斤、百多斤，一跃增产几倍、十数倍、以至数十倍，成为全国粮食增产的高峰。许多高产区这一年增产的幅度也很大。
    1958年农作物的全面丰收，具有重大的经济意义、政治影响和科学价值。按人口平均计算，目前我国每人全年占有的粮食已经高达一千二百斤左右，棉花达十斤以上，食用植物油预计也可比去年增加一半左右。这个惊人的伟大成就，又一次雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的伟大的生命力和无比的优越性。并且有力地驳斥了农业生产只能“慢慢来”、只能增长百分之几的悲观论调。农业大跃进还指出了一条高速度发展农业生产的道路，这就是：开展大面积高额丰产田运动，切实执行农业“八字宪法”，耕作园田化；改变浅耕粗作、广种薄收为深耕细作、少种多收；经过大面积高额丰产田运动，为把现有种农作物的耕地逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右奠定基础，然后，就将逐步实现毛主席的大地园林化的伟大理想。另外，这个伟大的成就也促进了农业科学的发展，群众创造的水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管“八字宪法”，就是这一年农业大跃进的实践与理论相结合的结晶。
    取得1958年农业大丰收的主要原因是：实行了政治挂帅，走群众路线和全面贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。冬小麦和春小麦播种时，都遇到了不同程度的干旱，北方小麦还遭到数次晚霜冻害，南方小麦秆锈病又严重流行。水稻和杂粮生长期中也都遇到不同程度的自然灾害。但是，由于党的总路线愈来愈深入人心，农民的干劲也愈来愈大。所以，不仅这些灾害被征服了，而且，还使增产浪潮一季比一季增高。
