    Successful Experiment with the Thousand-Hole Smoked Fertilizer Method
    According to a report from the Fujian Daily: The Bandong Experimental Farm of the Minqing County Agricultural Science Institute has successfully adopted the thousand-hole smoked fertilizer method. They selected a dry, elevated area, and dug chest-bone-shaped ditches in the middle. A central ditch was dug, 8 inches wide, 1.5 feet deep at the front, and 5 inches deep at the back; on both sides, five branch ditches were dug, each 5 inches wide, with the same depth as the central ditch, 4 inches deep at the back (the ditch openings should face the wind). Then, large clods of soil were piled on the bottom layer, medium clods on the middle layer, and small clods on the top layer, thus creating the thousand-hole structure. The fuel for smoking (rice straw, rice husks, miscellaneous materials) was placed at the front opening of the bottom central ditch. After the fuel emitted smoke, every hole, large and small, was filled with smoke. After smoking for two days and two nights, the soil clods fully absorbed the nitrogen, organic matter, and minerals from the smoke, becoming excellent fertilizer. According to analysis, every hundred dan (approximately 5000 kg) contains 0.16 jin (approximately 80 grams) of nitrogen, 0.01 jin (approximately 5 grams) of phosphorus, and 0.3 jin (approximately 150 grams) of potassium.

    千孔熏肥法试验成功
    据福建日报消息　闽清县农业科学研究所坂东试验场，采用千孔熏肥法成功。他们选择了一块高燥地方，中间开胸骨形的沟，中沟开一条，沟宽八寸，前深一尺半，后深五寸；两边支沟各开五条，沟宽五寸，沟深和中沟一样，后深四寸（沟口要顺风向），然后把大块土堆下层、中块土堆中层、小块土堆上层，这样就堆成了千孔。熏烧的燃料（稻草、粗糠、杂物）放在底下中沟前口。燃料发烟以后，每个大小孔都熏有烟，熏到两天两夜，土块充分吸取烟中的氮气和有机质、矿物质，就成为很好的肥土。据分析每百担含氮零点一六斤，含磷零点零一斤，含钾零点三斤。
