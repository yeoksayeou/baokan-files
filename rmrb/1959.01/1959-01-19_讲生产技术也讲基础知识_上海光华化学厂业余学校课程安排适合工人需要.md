Teaching Production Technology and Basic Knowledge
    Shanghai Guanghua Chemical Plant's spare-time school curriculum suits the needs of workers
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The employee spare-time school run by Shanghai Guanghua Chemical Plant combines production technology classes with "point-to-surface" teaching of cultural and basic knowledge courses. This not only adapts to the current production needs of the workshops but also rapidly improves the basic theoretical knowledge of the workers.
    This factory produces inorganic chemical products, and some products are made using indigenous methods. Workers urgently need to master production processes in a relatively short period, solve key production problems, and improve product quality. When the school first opened in October of last year, it used the study of key production problems and the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers as the basis for production technology teaching, solving many production problems. However, the content of the study was limited to a specific workshop or a specific production link, which was narrow in scope, and the teaching had limitations, which could not meet the learning requirements of workers in all workshops. At the same time, in solving key production problems or studying rationalization proposals, workers often encountered difficulties due to not having studied chemistry, physics, and mathematics, and they did not fully understand the problems. One worker wanted to use the downhill force of one cart to drive another cart uphill, interlocked and automatically circulating materials. However, because he did not master the physics knowledge of "momentum" and "speed," he encountered difficulties. After studying these situations, the factory's Party organization, along with the workers and school teachers, decided to increase the study of systematic cultural and basic knowledge courses while teaching production technology courses in each workshop.
    How to teach cultural and basic knowledge courses was a new problem encountered by the spare-time political, cultural, and technical school. This issue aroused extensive discussion among the workers. In the end, everyone affirmed that the old-fashioned "formalized" path could not be taken, and the teaching methods of ordinary schools could not be copied. Teaching must be carried out in accordance with the characteristics of the workers and production. First, it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of workers' spare-time learning and organize learning in a more, faster, better, and more economical way; second, workers are adults with rich practical experience and a strong understanding ability, especially in chemistry, they have a lot of perceptual knowledge, and only need to learn more complete theoretical knowledge; third, basic knowledge courses must be combined with professional courses in production business. Based on these requirements and conditions, the school revised the teaching plan and decided to explain key production problems through production technology courses while simultaneously offering cultural and basic knowledge courses—chemistry, physics, mathematics (students in the preparatory class who have just escaped illiteracy study language and arithmetic). Each course adopts the method of first popularizing and then improving, that is, first eliminating "chemistry blindness," "mathematics blindness," and "physics blindness," and then gradually supplementing and improving in the study of the production technology of various products in the factory. Start with the currently necessary parts and continue until you master the comprehensive knowledge needed in the factory's production. In the future, combine learning advanced production technology and manufacturing cutting-edge products to study chemical mathematics, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical engineering principles, and chemical machinery technology courses. From training workers to become all-rounders in the factory's production, and even all-rounders in the chemical industry's production.
    At present, after nearly forty teaching hours of intensive cultural and basic knowledge courses, workers in this factory have studied inorganic chemistry courses closely related to production. Workers have learned twenty elements and their molecular formulas, the basic concepts of inorganic compounds and chemical reactions, and have learned how to calculate equivalent concentrations and some calculation formulas that are often encountered in operations but cannot be calculated. Workers generally reflect that this kind of learning is useful and improves quickly. Through production technology courses and chemistry courses, the workers in the cement workshop quickly mastered the percentage of ingredients, the operating method of adding materials, understood that the iron filings added to the raw materials are sintering aids, which can reduce the sintering temperature, and understood the problems of preventing agglomeration, which will greatly improve the quantity and quality of cement production.

    讲生产技术也讲基础知识
    上海光华化学厂业余学校课程安排适合工人需要
    本报讯　上海光华化学厂举办的职工业余学校，结合生产技术课
  “由点到面”地教学文化基础知识课程，既适应车间当前生产的需要，又迅速地提高了工人的基础理论知识。
    这个工厂生产的都是无机化学产品，有些产品是用土法制成的。工人迫切要求在比较短的时期内掌握生产工艺，并能解决生产关键问题，提高产品质量。去年10月，学校刚开办时，就把研究生产关键问题和工人提出的合理化建议作为生产技术课进行教学，解决了不少生产上的问题。但是学习的内容，都是某一个车间的，或是某一生产环节的问题，范围狭小，教学有局限性，不能满足各车间工人学习的要求。同时在解决生产关键问题或研究合理化建议中，工人们经常碰到没有学过化学、物理、数学的困难，对问题理解不透。有一个工人想利用一辆车子下坡的力量带动另一辆车子上坡，互相牵动，自动循环送料。可是由于他没有掌握“冲力”和“速度”的物理知识，因此，就碰到困难。工厂党组织同工人、学校教师研究这些情况以后，决定在各车间教学生产技术课的同时，增加学习系统的文化基础知识课程。
    怎样教学文化基础知识课程，这是业余政治文化技术学校碰到的新问题。这问题引起了工人们广泛讨论，最后大家肯定不能走旧型“正规化”的道路，也不能照搬普通学校的教学方法，必须按照工人和生产的特点进行教学。第一，要照顾工人业余学习的特点，多快好省地组织学习；第二，工人是成人，具有丰富的实际经验，理解力强，特别是化学方面，感性知识很多，只是需要学习比较完整的理论知识；第三，基础知识课程必须与生产业务的专业课程结合进行。学校根据这些要求和条件，修订了教学计划，决定一面通过生产技术课来讲解生产关键问题；一面上文化基础知识课——化学、物理、数学（刚摆脱文盲状态的预备班学生学习语文和算术），各课采用先普及后提高的办法，即先扫“化学盲”、“数学盲”、“物理盲”，然后在学习全厂各种产品的生产工艺学中逐步补充提高。从当前必需的部分学起，一直到掌握工厂生产中需要的全面知识。以后再结合学先进生产技术和在制造尖端产品中，学习化工数学、无机化学、分析化学、化工原理、化工机械工艺学等课程。从培养工人成为本厂生产上的多面手，以至成为化工行业生产上的多面手。
    目前，这个工厂工人经过近四十个教时突击文化基础知识课程，学习了与生产有密切关系的无机化学课，工人们已学了二十个元素及其分子式，无机化合物的基本概念和化学反应等知识，并且学会了操作中经常遇到而不会计算的当量浓度和一些计算公式。工人们普遍反映这样学习管用，提高快。水泥车间的工人们通过生产技术课和化学课，很快掌握了配料的百分比、加料的操作方法，懂得了生料中加的铁屑是助焙剂，可使烧结温度降低，并且了解了防止结块等问题，对于提高水泥生产的数量和质量将起很大作用。　（陆左华）
