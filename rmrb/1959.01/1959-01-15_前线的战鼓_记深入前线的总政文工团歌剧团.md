    The Battle Drums at the Front
    A Record of the General Political Department Song and Dance Ensemble Opera Troupe Deep in the Front Lines
    Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporter

    The Opera Troupe of the General Political Department Song and Dance Ensemble of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, carrying honors such as "Advancing Battle Drums" given to them by the three armies at the front, left the Fujian front on the 10th.

    Just as the three armies at the Fujian front were severely punishing the Kinmen Chiang troops, and victories were being reported frequently, they arrived at the front. They used art and literature to praise victory, boost the morale of the three armies, and expose and strike at the enemy. They performed for the soldiers regardless of location or conditions, in tunnels and in muddy, foot-trapping wilderness. In an open space of only one square meter, they stood up when they went on stage and squatted down when they left, singing passionately about victory. Once, they were performing on a certain outpost island when fierce artillery fire began, and the enemy fired hundreds of shells at the island. The deafening artillery fire and whistling shrapnel did not interrupt their singing. They persisted for three hours, completing the entire program.

    From late August to late November of last year, they performed a total of 361 shows, sometimes performing 20 shows a day. Wherever there were troops, they went to perform. They once performed for two cooks and organized an evening party for an officer who had been too busy directing combat to see the performance. More than 90% of the officers and soldiers on the forward positions and 100% of the officers and soldiers on the coastal islands saw their performances.

    At the heroic front, the troupe members, amidst intense performances, also enthusiastically worked day and night to create new works, writing, rehearsing, practicing, and revising as they went. This not only enriched the content of the performances but also made the program forms diverse and lively, which the soldiers never tired of watching. They created 369 works of various forms. After watching the four-act opera "Punishment," which the troupe members created on the spot, the soldiers happily took their hands and said, "It's great, that's just like our life and combat!" The songs they created reflecting the heroic fighting of the frontline troops have become widely popular in the army. The soldiers said, "Now there are songs everywhere. We usually hum little tunes, but in battle we can sing 'Artillery Bombards Kinmen Island,' and after the battle, we can sing 'The Fujian Front is Fighting Well.'"

    During their time on the Fujian front, the troupe members also participated in combat, training, labor, and support work. Liu Guangyi, an opera troupe member who went to the artillery unit, loaded 71 shells in one go. Wu Leguang could pass shells, load, and pull the firing cord, acting as several gunners at once. Wang Jialun and Yao Kun also did battlefield mobilization work during combat, enlivening battlefield life. The troupe members who went to the infantry units felt proud to be serving as border guards for the motherland. The troupe members who went to the people's communes insisted on going to the fields, the sea, and cleaning pigsties with the commune members, doing whatever the commune members did. The soldiers praised them, saying, "When the artillery fire started, you came to the front, and your footprints were everywhere in the tunnels and positions. You repaired fortifications and moved shells in the battle, aiming and loading, literary warriors acting as gunners, both literary and military, capable of doing anything." Thirteen troupe members were rated as "multi-skilled gunners" by the troops, some were also rated as "six-good" soldiers and "multi-skilled combat soldiers," and many troupe members received commendations and verbal praise from the battalion and company commanders.

    Four and a half months of battlefield life have made them even stronger. They have established deep feelings with the soldiers, and some were reluctant to leave their newly met comrades and the positions they had fought or performed in. They said: The front is a great crucible, and the soldiers' noble style of taking hardship as honor, the position as home, selflessness, and loyalty to the motherland is the force that drives us. We will perform for them and praise them with even more enthusiasm, so that opera art can generate greater heat and emit greater light.

    前线的战鼓
    记深入前线的总政文工团歌剧团
    新华社前线记者
    中国人民解放军总政文工团歌剧团，带着前线三军给他们的“前进的战鼓”等荣誉，10日离开福建前线。
    正当福建前线三军严惩金门蒋军，胜利捷报频传的时候，他们来到了前线。他们用文艺来歌颂胜利，鼓舞三军的斗志，用文艺来暴露敌人，打击敌人。他们不择地点，不受任何条件限制，在坑道，在泥泞陷脚的旷野里，为战士们演出。在一块只有一平方公尺的空地上，他们演出时，上场站起来，下场蹲下去，满腔热情地歌唱胜利。有一次，他们在前哨某岛上演出，激烈的炮战开始了，敌人向这个岛上打了数百发炮弹。震耳的炮声、呼啸的弹片并没有打断他们的歌声，他们坚持了三个小时，把全部节目演完。
    从去年8月下旬到11月下旬，他们共演出三百六十一场，有时一天演出二十场。哪里有部队，他们就到哪里演出。他们曾经为两个炊事兵演出节目，为一个由于忙着指挥作战，而没有看到演出的军官组织晚会。前沿阵地上90％以上的官兵，沿海岛屿上百分之百的官兵都看到他们演的戏。
    在英雄辈出的前线，团员们在紧张的演出中，还热情地日夜突击创作，随写随排，边练边改。不但丰富了演出内容，而且使节目形式多种多样，生动活泼，战士们百看不厌。他们先后创作了各种形式的作品三百六十九件。战士们看完团员们突击创作的四场歌剧“惩罚”以后，高兴地拉着他们的手说：“太好了，我们的生活、战斗，就是这样！”他们创作的反映前线部队英勇战斗的歌曲，已在部队广泛流行。战士们说：“现在到处是歌声，平时哼小调，战斗中可以唱‘大炮轰击金门岛’，打完仗可以唱‘福建前线打得好’。”
    在福建前线期间，团员们还参加了战斗、训练、劳动和支前工作。到炮兵部队去的歌剧团员刘广义一气装了七十一发炮弹；吴乐光能递炮弹、装填、拉火，一个人当几个炮手；王加伦、姚昆还在战斗中作战场鼓动工作，活跃战场生活。到步兵部队去的团员都感到能当上祖国的海防哨兵而自豪。到人民公社去的团员，坚持和社员们下田、下海、打扫猪圈，社员们干什么他们也干什么。战士们表扬他们说：“炮战一开始，你们来前线，坑道、阵地到处有你们的足迹，在战斗中修工事、搬炮弹，又瞄准来又装填，文艺战士当炮手，又文又武都能干。”有十三个团员被部队评为“多能炮手”，有的还被评为“六好”战士和“多能战斗兵”，还有不少团员受到营部、连部首长的通令嘉奖和口头表扬。
    四个半月战地生活的锻炼，使他们更加坚强。他们和战士们建立起深厚的感情，有些人临走还舍不得离开新结识的战友，舍不得战斗过或演出过的阵地。他们说：前线是一座大熔炉，战士们的以艰苦为荣、阵地为家，舍己为人、忠于祖国的高尚风格，是推动我们的力量。我们要更加热情地表演他们，歌颂他们，让歌剧艺术发更大的热，放更大的光。
