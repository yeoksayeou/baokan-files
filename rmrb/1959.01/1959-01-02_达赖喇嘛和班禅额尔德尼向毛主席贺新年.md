Dalai Lama's Greetings to Chairman Mao and the State Council:

	On the occasion of the New Year 1959, I would like to express my auspicious wishes and profound respect to you and the State Council with infinite excitement.

	In 1958, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and yourself, the people of all ethnic groups in the country exerted soaring efforts and launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings. They completed and overfulfilled the production task of 10.7 million tons of steel ahead of schedule, enabling the socialist construction of our country to achieve amazing and great achievements. I firmly believe that on the basis of the victory in 1958, the heroic people of all ethnic groups in the country will surely see an even greater leap forward in 1959.

	Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, various tasks in the Tibet region have also made some progress. The patriotic consciousness of the Tibetan people has risen higher than before, and the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and within the Tibetan people has also been strengthened. At the same time, certain achievements have also been made in economic construction and cadre training. In order to consolidate the existing achievements, we will continue to study hard, work actively, and strive to build a new Tibet and build a great socialist motherland!

Panchen Erdeni's Greetings

Respected Chairman Mao:

	On the happy occasion of New Year's Day in 1959, I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to you—the most beloved and great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country—on behalf of the monks and laypeople, and wish you boundless longevity.

	Over the past year, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" pointed out by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and yourself, the people of the whole country have launched a massive and magnificent new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward. Brilliant victories have been achieved on all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, thus bringing about tremendous changes in the economic and social outlook of our country. Now, the people of our country are experiencing a great era of one day equaling twenty years, leaping forward on the road of socialism at an unprecedented speed in history.

	In the new year, the people of the whole country will follow the great call of "hard struggle for three years" instructed by you and the magnificent struggle goals in various undertakings indicated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, unite as one, and strive with soaring enthusiasm for a greater leap forward in 1959.

	Over the past year, under the correct leadership and loving care of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and yourself, a series of tasks have been carried out in the Tibet region with our close unity and joint efforts with all the comrades stationed in Tibet, and great achievements have been made. We deeply feel the warmth of the big family of the socialist motherland. Chairman Mao! We guarantee that we will follow the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and your kind teachings, work together with all comrades in Tibet, strengthen political study, continuously improve ideological understanding, further consolidate and enhance national unity, continue to expand and consolidate the patriotic and anti-imperialist united front, thoroughly smash the conspiracies and sabotage activities of imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements, and resolutely join the people of the whole country in firmly taking the socialist road.
