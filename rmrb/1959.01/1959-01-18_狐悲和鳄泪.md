    The United States Congress openly advocated that the United States take action to prevent the new Cuban government from punishing the murderous criminals of the former dictatorial regime, clamoring to "appease Castro before he exterminates the Cuban people."
    It is entirely Cuba's own business for the Cuban government to execute a group of criminals with blood debts. These heinous enemies of the people deserve to be punished. Why should the American masters care?
    In the past, when dictator Batista slaughtered Cubans in Cuba, the American rulers never showed the slightest sympathy for the thousands upon thousands of Cubans who were killed, nor did they express the slightest dissatisfaction with the dictatorial regime. On the contrary, Batista used the guns and ammunition supplied by the United States to slaughter the Cuban people. After the collapse of the dictatorial regime, a group of Cuban reactionaries, who wished to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin to be satisfied, even found their shelter in the United States. How shameless it is that these gentlemen in Washington are putting on a hypocritical show of compassion in front of the Cuban people today!
  Washington's clamor not only reflects the instinct of the American ruling group to "feel sorrow for the fox who dies," but also these crocodile tears foreshadow that the United States is looking for an excuse to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. But the fox's true sorrow and the crocodile's fake tears can only arouse greater hatred of American imperialism among the Cuban people.

    狐悲和鳄泪
    美国一些议员公开主张美国采取行动阻止古巴新政府惩处前独裁政权的杀人凶犯，叫嚷要
  “使卡斯特罗在灭绝古巴居民前平息下来”。
    古巴政府要处决一批血债累累的罪犯完全是古巴自己的事情，这些罪恶滔天的人民公敌理应受到惩罚，何劳美国老爷们过问？
    过去，独裁者巴蒂斯塔在古巴杀人如麻，并未见美国统治者对成千成百被杀害的古巴人民流露过半点同情，或者对独裁政权表示过一丝不满。相反的，巴蒂斯塔用的正是美国源源供应的刀枪子弹来屠杀古巴人民。在独裁政权垮台之后，一群古巴人民欲食其肉寝其皮始甘心的反动分子还在美国找到了他们的庇护所，华盛顿的这些先生们今天却在古巴人民面前装出一付悲天悯人的假慈悲相，是何等的恬不知耻！
  华盛顿的叫嚷，不仅反映了美国统治集团“兔死狐悲”的本能，而且这种鳄鱼的眼泪预示着美国正在为干涉古巴内政找寻借口。但是狐狸的真悲哀和鳄鱼的假眼泪都只能激起古巴人民对美国帝国主义更大的仇恨。
