    Promoting Advanced Experiences in Accumulating and Manufacturing Fertilizer
    Grasping the advanced to lead the backward, visits and appraisals, on-site meetings—these are all extremely important working methods that have been tested in the past, especially during the Great Leap Forward last year, and have proven effective. To achieve an even greater leap forward this year, we must continue to implement these methods. In the current movement to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, it is even more important to firmly and vigorously grasp these methods, summarize and promote advanced experiences in accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, and improve labor efficiency. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction has recently organized agricultural cadres to summarize, exchange, and promote experiences and methods of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer from various regions. This approach is undoubtedly very meaningful.
    In the past, some people did not pay much attention to summarizing and promoting experiences in fertilizer work, because they often considered this work too simple. In fact, accumulating fertilizer is not simple, and manufacturing fertilizer is even more complex. Especially today, in order to accumulate and produce much more and better fertilizer than in the past in a short period, under the condition of rural labor forces fighting on separate fronts, it is even more necessary to pay attention to techniques and methods. High-level techniques and correct methods lead to high efficiency and good fertilizer quality; conversely, the accumulated and manufactured fertilizer will be small in quantity and poor in quality. In the previous period, the Boli Town People's Commune in Boli County, Heilongjiang Province, had accumulated a considerable amount of natural fertilizer and manufactured indigenous chemical fertilizer compared to the fertilization plan; however, a recent inspection revealed that over one thousand tons of indigenous chemical fertilizer that had been smoked were not fully smoked through because the cellars were too large; and most of the over 300,000 tons of green manure pressed in the summer had not fermented. The commune quickly sent technicians to other places to learn the experience of smoking chemical fertilizer, and later changed to smaller cellars, resulting in more and better indigenous chemical fertilizer. See, how can accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer be done without paying attention to techniques? To improve techniques, it is necessary to promote advanced experiences from both local and other areas.
    Our farmers have many good experiences in accumulating farm manure. Since the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign last year, various regions have made many new creations. They can not only accumulate large amounts of high-efficiency natural fertilizer, but also use indigenous methods to produce a variety of chemical fertilizers, and even cultivate some bacterial fertilizers. In short, the inventions and creations in fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing in various regions are very rich and colorful. The problem lies in how to carefully identify and summarize these inventions and creations, and widely promote them in the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign. How should this work be started? It is best for local agricultural leading organs to conduct some investigations to roughly understand how many types of fertilizer are available locally, what good experiences there are, and then, based on the local fertilizer resources, determine which major fertilizers can be developed in large quantities locally, and summarize and promote advanced experiences related to the accumulation and manufacturing of these fertilizers. In this way, the leaders will have a clear idea of how to guide the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign, and the masses will also have a clear direction for accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer.
    Accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer is the primary task in current rural production. How can this work be both prominent and combined with other tasks? Some regions have now created some experiences. For example, Dingxi County, Gansu Province, has summarized the experience of "nine major combinations": combining fertilizer accumulation with animal husbandry, sideline occupations, health campaigns, soil and water conservation, land leveling, soil improvement, pest and disease elimination, and the development of local industries. In terms of the organization and leadership of fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing, various regions also have many specific experiences, such as combining professional teams with mass fertilizer accumulation, the responsibility system, the reward system, etc. Summarizing and introducing good experiences in this regard is also very beneficial for promoting the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign in the people's communes.

### 推广积肥造肥先进经验

    推广积肥造肥先进经验
    抓先进带落后，参观评比，现场会议，这些都是在过去，特别是在去年大跃进中久经考验，行之有效的极为重要的工作方法。为了实现今年更大的跃进，必须继续贯彻执行这些方法。在当前的积肥造肥运动中，更要紧紧地、狠狠地抓住这些方法，总结和推广积肥造肥工作中的先进经验，提高劳动效率。山西省农业建设厅最近也组织农业干部总结交流和推广各地积肥造肥的经验和方法。这种做法无疑是很有意义的。
    过去，有些人对总结和推广肥料工作方面的经验是不大重视的，原因是他们往往把这项工作看得太简单。其实积肥并不简单，造肥更不简单。尤其在今天，要在短短的时间里，在农村劳动力分线作战的情况下积攒和造出比过去多得多、也好得多的肥料，就更非讲究技术和方法不可。技术高明、方法对头，效率就高，肥料质量就好；反之，积出造出的肥料，量少质也差。黑龙江省勃利县勃利镇人民公社，前一时期积的自然肥料和造的土化肥同施肥计划比起来已经不算少了；但是最近一检查，发现已熏出的一千多吨土化肥，因为窖子过大，外面没有熏透；夏季压的三十多万吨绿肥，多数没有发酵。公社赶紧派技术员到外地去学习熏化肥的经验，后来改成小窖，熏出的土化肥又多又好。请看，积肥制肥不讲究技术怎么能行呢？要提高技术，就需要推广本地的和外地的先进经验。
    我国农民在积集农家肥料方面是有不少好的经验的，去年以来的积肥造肥运动中，各地更有很多新的创造，不但能积集大量的高肥效的自然肥料，而且能用土法造出多种多样的化学肥料，更能培制一些细菌肥料。总之，目前各地积肥造肥方面的发明创造十分丰富多采，问题在于如何将这些发明创造加以认真的鉴定和总结，并在积肥造肥运动中普遍推广。这项工作从何着手？各地农业领导机关最好能作些调查，大体上摸清本地有多少种肥料，有哪些好的经验，然后根据本地的肥源情况，确定本地可以大量发展哪些主要肥料，并且总结和推广有关积集和制造这些肥料的先进经验。这样，领导者指导积肥造肥运动心中有数，群众对于积肥造肥也有明确的方向。
    积肥造肥是当前农村生产中的首要任务，如何使这项工作既突出，又能与其他工作相结合？现在有些地区也创造了一些经验。例如甘肃省定西县就总结了“九大结合”的经验：积肥与畜牧业、副业、卫生运动、水土保持、土地平整、土壤改良、消灭病虫、发展地方工业等相结合。积肥造肥的组织领导方面，各地还有很多具体的经验，如建立专业队与群众积肥相结合、责任制、奖励制等等，总结和介绍这方面的好的经验，对于促进人民公社的积肥造肥运动，也是很有好处的。
