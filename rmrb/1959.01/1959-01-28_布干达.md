Buganda

On the 24th, the new Legislative Assembly of Buganda passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the enslaving treaty that placed Buganda under British "protection."

Buganda is located in the center of Uganda and is one of the four provinces of Uganda, covering an area of more than 60,000 square kilometers and with a population of about 1.5 million. It is the oldest and most important kingdom in Uganda, and the most economically and culturally developed region in Uganda. Uganda's capital, Entebbe, and the trade center, Kampala, are both located within its borders, and Kampala is also the capital of Buganda.

In the nineteenth century, Buganda was a powerful kingdom in equatorial Africa. In 1889, the British "East Africa Company" sent troops to invade Buganda, and in 1890 it forced the King of Buganda to sign an enslaving agreement, placing Buganda under the "protection" of the company. In 1893, the British government took over the "protection" of Buganda from the "East Africa Company," and in June 1894, Britain formally declared Buganda its "protectorate" and listed it as one of the four provinces of Uganda.

Since then, the people of Buganda, together with the people of other regions of Uganda, have actively opposed British enslavement and strived for national independence.

In June 1953, Britain conspired to merge Uganda, Tanganyika, and Kenya into the "East African Federation" to facilitate its control. King Mutesa II of Buganda, with the support of the people, resolutely opposed this. As a result, he was exiled by the colonial authorities. This incident sparked a strong anti-British movement among the people of Buganda. Britain was finally forced to send Mutesa II back to Uganda in October 1955.

In February 1957, the Buganda Legislative Assembly passed a resolution demanding that Britain grant autonomy within a certain period, but this request was unreasonably rejected by the British colonialists. Not long ago, the previous Legislative Assembly of Buganda passed a resolution demanding independence and an end to British "protectorate" status. But it was also rejected by the British Governor.

    布干达
    24日，布干达新立法议会通过决议要求废除关于把布干达置于英国“保护”之下的奴役性条约。
    布干达位于乌干达的中心，是乌干达的四个省份之一，约六万多平方公里，人口约一百五十万。它是乌干达境内最古老、最主要的王国，是乌干达经济和文化比较发达的地区。乌干达首都恩德培和贸易中心坎帕拉都在它的境内，坎帕拉又是布干达的首府。
    十九世纪时，布干达曾是赤道非洲强盛的王国。1889年，英国“东非洲公司”派军队侵入布干达，1890年又强迫布干达国王签订了奴役性的协定，把布干达置于该公司的“保护”之下。1893年，英国政府从“东非洲公司”手里接管了对布干达的“保护”，1894年6月，英国正式宣布布干达为它的“保护”国。并把它列为乌干达的四个省份之一。
    自从那时起，布干达人民就和乌干达其他地区的人民一起积极反对英国奴役，争取民族独立。
    1953年6月，英国阴谋将乌干达、坦噶尼喀和怯尼亚合并为“东非联邦”，以利于它的控制。布干达国王穆特萨二世在人民的支持下坚决反对。因此被殖民当局放逐出境。这件事激起了布干达人民强烈的反英运动。英国终于被迫在1955年10月把穆特萨二世送回乌干达。
    1957年2月，布干达立法议会曾通过决议，要求英国在一定时期内给予自治，但是这个要求被英国殖民者无理拒绝。不久前，布干达上一届立法议会通过一项要求独立和结束英国“保护国”地位的决议。但也同样遭到英国总督的否决。
