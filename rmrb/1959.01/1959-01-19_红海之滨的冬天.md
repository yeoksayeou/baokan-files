A dispatch from Yemen

    Winter on the Red Sea Coast
    Liu Kaichen
    It is already December, and in our country with its distinct seasons, it is the dead of winter. The north wind is howling, and the rivers have already frozen over. But on the coast of the Red Sea in West Asia, the wind is gentle, the sun is warm, and the climate is like spring.
    Here, facing the turbulent Red Sea, are the port of Mocha, famous since ancient times for exporting coffee, and Hodeidah, recently designated as the capital of the United Arab States. Both are ancient cities and important ports of the Kingdom of Yemen. Since Britain occupied the territory of Aden in Yemen in 1839, Hodeidah has been Yemen's largest port. It has a population of 35,000 and is the second largest city after Sana'a. I recently arrived in Hodeidah from Taiz. When I got off the plane, I met Mohammed Basha, the King's representative in Hodeidah, who said to me with a smile, "You have arrived in Shanghai," which shows its importance.
    After leaving the airport, I drove straight to the city. Near the coast is a large area of white, flat-roofed buildings, the largest of which are the King's palace and Prince Badr's palace. They sparkle in the sunlight, somewhat like Shanghai on the banks of the Huangpu River. Behind them is a residential area of ​​round-roofed huts, with the white spires of several mosques towering in the middle, interspersed with green date palm trees, appearing so serene. Along the coast stand several ancient Arab-style blockhouses, protecting Yemen's coastline. White eagles circle in the sky, reluctant to leave this "Arabian Paradise."
    The scenery in the suburbs of Hodeidah is even more extraordinary. Within an area of ​​less than ten kilometers, there is both a calm fishing port and a rolling desert of yellow sand.
    In order to see how the Yemeni people fish, early one morning in early December, I took a car out of the city and headed south. The sun also hurried up from the east to see us off. We sat in the car and drove for several hours on a dike three hundred to one thousand meters wide until we reached a port called Katibu. At this time, the sky was clear, connecting with the distant sea to form a natural circular roof standing on the earth. Katibu, where I stood, was a peninsula shape within this giant "Mongolian yurt." On the right was the blue open sea, with stormy waves, stirring up white spray, crashing against the sandy shore. On the left was the green inner sea, with a gentle breeze blowing, and countless ripples slowly advancing. Fishermen with white cloths wrapped around their heads, white sarongs around their waists, and faces tanned dark, were diligently casting their nets and fishing in sailboats. Some were pulling hooks, which had been cast the evening before. Sparsely arranged white mesh nets lined the shore, waiting for fish to enter the formation. These are Yemen's ancient fishing methods, coinciding with our country's indigenous fishing methods. The fishermen told me that along the Red Sea coast of Yemen, the important fishing ports include Hodeidah, Salif, Al-Mahabas, Hoba, Haya, Al-Hajh, and Midi. Due to the mild climate, fishing is possible year-round, and now is the best season for catching sardines. Among these fishing ports, the largest is Hodeidah, which also has several places to fish, and the Katibu fishing port we visited is the largest of them. They also said that the fish production along Yemen's Red Sea coast is abundant, with many varieties. Some of the fish caught are sold in the coastal markets, and some are initially processed by salting, air-drying, sun-drying, and roasting, which can be stored for three to six months and transported to the interior of Yemen or exported to Aden, Sudan, and Ethiopia.
    The next day, I took a car again, passing through the city and heading northeast. A strong wind rolled up yellow sand, hitting us in the face. The straw hat on my head, tied with a rope under my chin, was still blown off by the wind. Only then did I realize why Arabs like to wear brimless hats or wrap their heads in cloth. Here is a vast, boundless desert, with sparse clumps of weeds growing on the sand dunes. The sun shines down without obstruction, and I feel stuffy and hot even wearing a shirt. Suddenly, I saw a water tower, twelve and a half meters high, standing in front, waiting to be completed. Next to it was a large bucket of water just drawn from the well. I was overjoyed and immediately took a sip. It was truly the oasis water of the desert. This well was built with the help of Czechoslovakia. It is Hodeidah's only modern well, thirty-six meters deep. After a diesel engine pumps the water into the water tower, it can solve the drinking water problem for the city's residents, unlike before, when to drink better sweet water, it had to be transported by camels or donkeys from the mountains twenty or thirty miles away.
    Hodeidah is also a developed industrial and cultural city in Yemen. Along the coast are concentrated shipbuilding handicraft industries, and within the city, there are two larger textile workshops, six coffee processing plants, a soda factory, a power plant, a royal hospital with modern equipment, and a regular school. I visited them, and everyone from workers to students, from the school principal to the hospital director, expressed warm welcome and friendship. This is because I am from China, with 650 million peace-loving people.
    When I visited workers repairing sailboats by the sea, they generously invited me to sit on the ground and chat with them, and poured me tea made from coffee skins from a pottery pot. They said, "The Yemeni and Chinese people are brothers." When talking about Taiwan, they knew that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, just as Aden is a part of Yemeni territory. Yes, from their own experience, they realized that imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Yemeni people. I was moved by their enthusiasm and drank the coffee skin tea in large gulps. It tasted like our country's ginger soup, both sweet and spicy, making my heart even warmer.
    This school in Hodeidah is called "Sword School." The principal is a middle-aged man, calm and serious, and a keen educator. He told me that the school has been in existence for seventeen years, with fifteen teachers and three hundred students, divided into preparatory, primary, and first-year junior high school sections. The curriculum includes the Quran, arithmetic, history, geography, English, etc., but no music or physical education. When class started, a teacher took me to visit a classroom. A teacher was writing "The Chinese love freedom" on the blackboard and asked the students whether it was a noun phrase or a verb phrase, whether the nouns were singular or plural, etc. The students answered enthusiastically and orderly. When I left the classroom, I said to them in Arabic, "The Yemeni people also love freedom," and those little hands clapped enthusiastically.
    Hodeidah, this coastal city of Yemen, is now presenting a moving and vibrant picture. The motors roar all day long, breaking the silence of thousands of years. Yemeni young people drive bulldozers and work happily. Cars in the city transport supplies just unloaded from ships and head to warehouses. In the new port of Hodeidah, built with Soviet assistance, giant steel pipes tens of meters long extend out, spewing black mud from the seabed with their "big black basin mouths." The surveying team aided by our country in Yemen is also busily surveying the terrain here.
    Yes, the Yemeni government and people are working hard for Hodeidah to have such a bright future: the newly built port will be able to berth ten-thousand-ton freighters; the highway built with the help of our country will connect Hodeidah with the traffic in the mountainous areas of the interior; the expanded airport will be able to accommodate the landing and takeoff of large aircraft; tall factories will stand in the suburbs. At that time, Hodeidah will be Yemen's economically developed industrial and commercial center and a transportation hub for land, sea, and air, and can gradually become a transshipment port between Europe and Asia, further promoting Yemen's independence, prosperity, and strength.

    红海之滨的冬天
    刘开宸
    已经是12月了，四季分明的我国，正届严冬，北风正在呼啸，河水业已结冰；而在西亚的红海之滨，风和日暖，气候如春。
    这里，面对着波浪滔滔的红海，有自古就以输出咖啡而闻名世界的摩加港，也有新近规定为阿拉伯联合邦首都的荷台达，它们都是也门王国的古老城市和重要港口。自从英国在1839年占领了也门的领土亚丁港以后，荷台达就是也门的最大港口，它拥有人口三万五千，是仅次于萨那的第二大城市。最近我从塔兹来到荷台达，下飞机遇到了在荷台达的国王代表穆罕默德·巴沙，他笑着对我说，“你们到了上海了”，其重要性，可见一般。
    离机场后，我乘汽车直奔市区，靠近海岸是一大片白色的平顶楼房，其中最大的是国王的行宫和巴德尔王太子的行宫，太阳光照着，都晶晶发光，有点像黄浦江边的上海。后面是一片圆顶茅屋的居民区，中间耸立着几个清真寺的白色塔尖，杂以绿色的枣椰树，显得那样宁静。海岸边上耸立着几座古老的阿拉伯式的碉堡，保卫着也门的海防线，白色老鹰兜着圈子在上空飞来飞去，舍不得离开这“阿拉伯的乐园”。
    荷台达郊区的风景，更加奇异，方圆不到十公里，既有风平浪静的渔港，又有黄沙滚滚的沙漠。
    为了看一看也门人怎样捕鱼，在12月初的一个清晨，我就乘汽车离市区向南前进，太阳也赶着从东方升起，为我们送行。我们坐在汽车上在宽三百到一千公尺的长堤上奔走了几小时以后，到了一个叫克提布的港口。这时，碧空万里，和远方的海水相接，形成一个天然的圆形屋顶，屹立在地球之上。我所站的克提布是个半岛形状，它就在这个巨型的“蒙古包”当中，右边是蓝色的外海，惊涛骇浪，掀起白色浪花，向沙岸冲击。左边是碧绿的内海，微风吹来，无数道波纹，慢慢地前进。头上缠着白布、腰间围着白色沙龙、面孔晒得黧黑的渔民们，正驾着帆船，辛勤地在那儿撒网捕鱼，有的正在拉钩，那是前一天傍晚撒下钓鱼的，岸边还疏疏落落地围着白色线网，等待鱼儿入阵，这些是也门的古老的捕鱼方法，和我国捕鱼的土办法，不约而同。渔民告诉我说，在也门的红海沿岸，重要渔港有荷台达、沙里夫、马阿巴斯、哈巴、哈亚、哈赫、米迪等，由于气候温和，一年四季都可捕鱼，而现在正是捕沙丁鱼的大好季节。这几个渔港里，最大的就是荷台达，荷台达也有几个地方可以捕鱼，而我们参观的克提布渔港又是其中最大的一个。他们又说，也门红海沿岸的鱼产是丰富的，种类很多，捕得的鱼，一部分在沿海市场上出卖，一部分用盐腌、风吹、日晒、火烤等办法初步加工，可储存三个月到六个月，运行也门内地或向亚丁、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚输出。
    第二天，我又乘汽车穿过市区向东北驰去，大风卷着黄沙，迎面扑来，头上戴的草帽用绳子扣着下巴被风吹得还是戴不住，这时，我才体会到为什么阿拉伯人喜欢戴无边帽或是用布缠头。这里是一望无际的茫茫沙漠，疏疏落落的沙丘上生着一撮一撮的杂草。太阳没遮拦地射下来，我穿着衬衫还感到闷热。突然发现前面耸立着一座十二公尺半高的水塔，正待竣工，旁边是刚从井下抽出的一大桶水，我如获至宝，马上喝了一口，真是沙漠中的温泉水。这口井是捷克斯洛伐克帮助修建的，是荷台达现在唯一的现代化的井，有三十六公尺深，柴油机把水压到水塔以后，可解决全市居民的饮水问题，不像以前，要饮较好的甜水，非从二、三十里外的山上用骆驼或毛驴运来不可了。
    荷台达也是也门的工业和文化发达的都市。在岸边集中着造船手工业，在市区内有两家较大的纺织作坊，六家咖啡加工场，一个汽水厂，一个发电厂，一所具有现代化设备的皇家医院和一所正规的学校。我访问了它们，从工人到学生，从学校校长到医院院长都表示了热烈的欢迎和友好。这是因为我是来自有六亿五千万爱好和平的人民的中国。
    当我在海边访问修理帆船的工人时，他们豪爽地叫我坐在地上和他们一起聊天，并从瓦罐里倒出咖啡皮的茶水给我喝，他们说：“也门人和中国人是弟兄”，谈到台湾时，他们知道台湾是中国领土的一部分，等于亚丁是也门的领土的一部分一样。是的，他们从切身的经验里体会到帝国主义是中也人民共同的敌人。我为他们的热情感动了，大口喝着咖啡皮的茶水，味似我国的生姜汤，既甜又辣，使我的心更热了。
    荷台达的这所学校叫“宝剑学校”，校长是一个中年人，沉着认真，是一个热心办学的人，他告诉我说，这学校已有十七年的历史，现有教员十五人，学生三百人，分预备部、小学部和初中一年级三部分。课程有可兰经、算术、历史、地理、英文等，没有音乐和体育。上课了，一位先生带我到教室去参观，一位先生在黑板上写着“中国人爱好自由”，并问学生是名词句还是动词句，其中名词是单数还是复数等，学生们回答得热烈而有秩序。我离开教室时，用阿文向他们说：“也门人也爱好自由”，那些小手都热烈地拍起来了。
    荷台达，这个也门的滨海城市，现在正呈现着一片动人的沸腾的图画。马达整天地吼叫着，打破了几千年来的沉默，也门的年轻人驾驶着推土机，兴高彩烈地工作着，市区里汽车运着刚从船上卸下来的物资，奔向仓库，苏联帮助建设的荷台达的新港里，伸展着几十公尺长的巨型钢管，张着“黑盆大口”从海底喷出黑色的泥浆，我国援助也门建设的测量队，也在这儿忙碌地测量着地形。
    是的，也门政府和人民正在为荷台达有这样一个光明的前景而努力地工作着：新建的港口将停泊着万吨巨轮；我国帮助建设的公路将沟通着荷台达和内地山区的交通；扩建的机场，将供大型飞机降落、起飞；高高的工厂，将耸立在郊区。那时，荷台达将是也门的工商业发达的经济中心，和海陆空的交通要道，并可以逐渐成为欧亚两洲的转口港埠，进一步推进也门的独立富强。
