Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, January 27th: Oman's Deputy Imam, al-Kharsy, today called on Asian and African countries here to protest against British imperialist aggression in Oman.

Al-Kharsy, who is currently leading an Omani delegation on a visit to Burma, explained the current situation in Oman at a press conference this evening. Al-Kharsy said that the British imperialists' dirty war against Oman has been going on for about two years. The main reason for this imperialist aggression is due to Oman's oil resources and strategic location. According to geological survey reports, Al-Kharsy said, the Fahud region of Oman is a traditional oil deposit. Warmongers believe that Oman is the best place to establish air and naval bases to threaten the national independence movements of Middle Eastern countries.

Al-Kharsy said: "Britain, angered by the tenacious resistance it has encountered and eager to destroy our movement, has been using all the means at its disposal." British imperialists have been constantly bombing Oman's undefended towns and villages, killing and wounding many civilians, including many women and children.

The Omani leader emphasized: "Despite all these dark circumstances, the Arabs of Oman are now more determined than ever to fight for their right to pursue an independent line in world affairs based on the principles of non-interference and non-alignment."

The Deputy Imam said that his country would accept assistance from Asian and African countries, including moral and material assistance. He said that there are currently about 15,000 to 18,000 Omani fighters.

Al-Kharsy and his delegation arrived in Rangoon from India on January 24 and are scheduled to leave Rangoon for China on the 28th. During their stay in Rangoon, the Omani delegation visited the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and leaders of major political organizations.

Li Yimang, the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 27th to entertain the Omani delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 26th: The Oman Imam's Office in Cairo issued a statement on the 26th stating that the battles of Omani nationalists against the British occupation forces are becoming more and more intense, and the scope of the battles is expanding, now developing to areas such as Tanuf, Kema, Samit, Darsarab, Darzaki, and Damiti. Explosions have also occurred in these areas, especially on the highway connecting Awabi, Rustaq, and Hajar.

The statement said that Omani nationalists in Tamani shot down three British aircraft. One near Darsarab, another on the Muscat highway, and the third was burned near Jenena, with all six crew members burned to death. The statement said that Omani nationalists blew up two British military vehicles on the Awabi highway and also destroyed an armored vehicle, killing all twenty British soldiers on board.

The statement said that in a battle in the Saraykhraya area, four British soldiers were killed, and in another battle at the foot of Mount Tanuf, sixteen British soldiers were killed.

    哈尔塞说：“英国由于自己遭到的顽强抵抗而恼羞成怒，并且急于摧毁我们的运动，因此它一直在使用它所掌握的各种手段。”英帝国主义者不断地轰炸阿曼没有防御的城镇和乡村，炸死和炸伤了许多老百姓，不少妇女和儿童。
    这位阿曼领袖强调指出：“尽管有这一切黑暗的情况，阿曼的阿拉伯人现在比以往任何时候都更有决心，争取他们在世界事务中遵循以不干涉、不结盟原则为基础的独立路线的权利。”
    这位副教长说，他的国家将接受亚非国家的援助，包括道义援助和物质援助。他说，阿曼战士目前共有一万五千人到一万八千人左右。
    哈尔塞和他的代表团是在1月24日从印度到达仰光的，预定在28日离开仰光到中国访问。阿曼代表团在仰光期间曾访问缅甸外交部和各主要政治组织的领导人。

    声明说，塔马尼的阿曼民族主义者击落了三架英国飞机。一架在达尔萨拉卜附近，另一架在马斯喀特公路上，第三架是在杰奈纳附近烧毁的，六名机上人员全部被烧死。声明说，阿曼民族主义者在阿瓦比公路上炸毁了两辆英国军用车辆，还击毁了一辆装甲车，车上的二十名英国士兵全部被炸死。
