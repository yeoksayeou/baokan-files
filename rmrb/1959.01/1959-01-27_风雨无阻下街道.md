In the large and small courtyards of Fenfang Liuli Street in Xuanwu District, Beijing, a young female doctor often appears carrying a hygiene kit. When elderly people see her, they gratefully say, "Coming out in such cold weather, truly a good doctor of the people!" Children surround her as soon as they see her, affectionately hugging her and refusing to let her leave.

This is Doctor Wang Yan from Beijing No. 1 Hospital. Since the implementation of the district doctor responsibility system last October, regardless of wind, snow, or freezing weather, she always goes door-to-door to explain hygiene knowledge to residents, deliver and change medicine, and provide guidance on nursing care. If someone's condition is more serious, she braves wind and rain to diagnose them at any time. One child is physically weak and often has minor ailments. She makes it a point to visit him once or twice a day. One day, it was already 10:00 PM, and she remembered the child's condition from that morning and was still worried, so she ran to give him a third diagnosis. She said: "If I don't go see him, I keep worrying in my heart, as if my own relative is sick."

Recently, the hospital has received several letters praising her, and the residents' committee even sent her a big-character poster: "Doctor Wang Yan is truly good, braving wind and rain to come to the streets, helping residents prevent and treat illnesses, working responsibly and with high enthusiasm, a people's doctor for the people, all thanks to the Party's good leadership. We must learn from her and actively produce to repay her." (Attached picture)

    风雨无阻下街道
    在北京宣武区粉房琉璃街的大小杂院里，经常有一个提着卫生包的青年女大夫出现。老年人一见了她，就感激地说：这么冷的天还来，真是人民的好大夫。小孩们一见就围上来，亲热地抱着不让走。
    这就是北京第一医院的王彦大夫。自从去年10月实行地段医士负责制以来，不管刮风下雪，天寒地冻，她总是要挨家挨户地给居民讲解卫生知识、送药换药和指导护理。如果有人病情较重，不管什么时候，她都风雨无阻地去诊断。有个小孩身体较弱，经常有些小毛病，她每天总要去看一两趟。有一天，已经是晚上十点钟了，她想起小孩上午的病情，总是放心不下，又跑去作第三次诊治。她说：不去看，心里就老惦记，好像自己的亲人病了一样。
    近来，医院里几次接到表扬她的信，居民委员会还给她送来一张大字报：“王彦大夫真正好，风雨无阻来街道，帮助居民防治病，工作负责热情高，人民医士为人民，都是党的好领导，我们一定学习她，积极生产作答报。”（附图片）
