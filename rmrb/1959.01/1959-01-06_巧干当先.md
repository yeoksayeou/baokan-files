    Clever Work Comes First
    The Zhang River, which runs through the entire territory of Wuxiang County, is a river that has brought nothing but harm. It has 40,000 mu of barren sandy beaches and 100,000 mu of terraced fields that cannot be guaranteed a good harvest. Last year, the Party boldly proposed to the people of the county to store and manage the Guan River water. Construction preparations began in August. This reservoir project requires 3.46 million cubic meters of earth and stone, 3.2 million labor days, and an investment of 4.5 million yuan. After the reservoir is completed, it can store 150 million cubic meters of water, turning 140,000 mu of arid land and sandy beaches into paddy fields, increasing grain production by 80 million catties, and generating 1,500 kilowatts of electricity. Faced with these difficulties, some people wavered, believing that without the state transferring labor and allocating funds, it would not be possible to accomplish. But the heroic people of Wuxiang, under the leadership of the Party, were not intimidated by the difficulties, and instead relied on the masses to build the reservoir. At that time, three questions were raised for everyone to discuss: 1. What to do about the lack of funds for building the reservoir; rely on ourselves or rely on the state? 2. What method should be used to build the dam for the Guan River Reservoir, and how to adapt to achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results? 3. How to solve the problem of insufficient supply of materials, steel bars, cement, and explosives?
    After discussion, everyone's minds became clear. Everyone demanded to use indigenous methods and use local materials instead of foreign equipment to build reservoirs and factories. The masses contributed labor, materials, and technology, resulting in the construction of ten factories from scratch, including cement, explosives, tools, ball bearings, gypsum, flour, power generation, weaving, repair, and pig breeding, saving an investment of 2.5 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the planned investment. Advanced Soviet experience was adopted to build the dam by dumping earth into the water, and 320 canteens were set up on the construction site, saving 1.5 million labor days. In terms of time, the reservoir construction task was completed seven months ahead of schedule. All these prove that practical work and hard work must be combined with clever work; fully proving that the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is correct.

    巧干当先
    横流武乡县全境的漳河，是百害而无一利的一条河，有四万亩沙滩寸草不长，十万亩梯田不能保收。去年，党向全县人民大胆提出把关河水蓄起来、管起来。8月就开始做施工准备。这个水库工程需土石方三百四十六万公方，需投工三百二十万个、投款四百五十万元，水库落成后可以蓄水一点五亿公方，使十四万亩旱地、沙滩变成水田，可以增产八千万斤粮食，能发一千五百瓩电。在困难面前有些人就动摇了，认为没有国家抽调劳力、调拨资金，凭自己是干不起来的。但英雄的武乡人民在党的领导下不但没有让困难吓倒，而依靠群众把水库建起来了。当时提出三个问题请大家讨论：一、修水库缺资金怎么办；靠自己还是靠国家？二、关河水库用什么方法打坝，如何适应多快好省？三、物资器材、钢筋、水泥、炸药等供不应求如何解决？
    一讨论，大家心里明亮了。大家要求土法上马，以土代洋修水库办工厂。群众献工、献料、献技术，结果白手起家地建起水泥、炸药、工具、滚珠、石膏、面粉、发电、编造、修造、养猪等十个工厂，节省投资二百五十万元，占应投资数60％。采用了苏联先进经验水中倒土筑坝，并在工地办起三百二十个食堂，节省工一百五十万个。从时间上看，也提前七个月完成了建库任务。这些都证明实干、苦干，还必须加上巧干；充分证明党的多快好省的建设社会主义的总路线是正确的。
