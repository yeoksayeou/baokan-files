Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th. Our outstanding female parachutists Cui Xiuying, Geng Guifang, and He Jianhua, in a parachuting demonstration competition held in Kaifeng, broke the world record of 7.07 meters for the women's 1,500-meter daytime group joint precision landing parachute jump, which was set by Soviet athletes in April 1957, with an excellent score of an average of 2.69 meters from the bullseye.

This is the first time Chinese athletes have broken a world record in 1959.

The demonstration competition was held on the morning of the 8th. At that time, the wind speed in the sky and on the ground reached 4 meters per second. After the athletes jumped out of the cabin, their movements were natural and accurate. They all landed very close to the bullseye in the end. Among them, Cui Xiuying was only 45 centimeters away from the center of the bullseye. Geng Guifang was 2.60 meters from the bullseye. He Jianhua was 5.02 meters. At that time, their scores were repeatedly verified by ground and in-flight referees, and it was determined that the scores were completely qualified.

Cui Xiuying, Geng Guifang, and He Jianhua have been participating in parachuting for less than three years, but after diligent study and hard work, and with the help of the leadership, they broke the world record for the women's 1,000-meter daytime group precision landing parachute jump in September 1958.

    一千五百公尺日间集体联合定点着陆跳伞
    我女运动员打破世界纪录
    新华社郑州9日电　我国优秀的女子跳伞运动员崔秀英、耿桂芳和赫建华在开封市举行的一次跳伞表演赛中，以距靶心平均两公尺六十九公分的优异成绩，打破了1957年4月间由苏联运动员创造的七公尺零七公分的女子一千五百公尺日间集体联合定点着陆跳伞的世界纪录。
    这是中国运动员在1959年第一次打破世界纪录。
    这次表演赛是8日上午举行的。当时天空和地面风速曾达到每秒钟四公尺。运动员们跳离机舱后，动作自然而又准确。最后都降落在距靶心很近的地方。其中崔秀英离靶中心只有四十五公分。耿桂芳距靶中心是二公尺六十公分。赫建华五公尺零二公分。当时她们的成绩经过地面和机内裁判反复核定，确定这个成绩完全合格。
    崔秀英、耿桂芳、赫建华参加跳伞的时间都还不到三年，但经过勤学苦练和领导的帮助，1958年9月就曾经打破过女子一千公尺日间集体定点着陆跳伞的世界纪录。
