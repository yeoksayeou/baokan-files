The transformation from "intermittent pulping" to "continuous pulping" is a new technology in China's paper industry. This new technology was first successfully tested by the Yanjing Paper Mill in Beijing and the Zhongyuan Paper Mill in Yibin. The Ministry of Light Industry has successively held on-site meetings in Beijing and Yibin to promote this experience.

After the experience of continuous pulping was promoted nationwide, it played a significant role in solving the problem of insufficient pulping capacity, which was widespread in the paper industry. After two paper mills in Hunan Province promoted this experience, their pulping capacity increased by more than 30%; nine workshops in Tianjin promoted this experience, and efficiency generally increased by about 40%; Shanghai Lihua Paper Mill, when using the intermittent pulping method, had a maximum output of 625 kilograms per hour with four pulping machines, but after adopting the continuous pulping method, the hourly output immediately reached 1,100 kilograms, an increase of 50% to 60% in capacity compared to the intermittent pulping method. In addition, the adoption of continuous pulping method also has a positive effect on improving pulp quality, saving electricity and reducing labor intensity.

Pulping is an intermediate process between pulping and papermaking. In the past, due to insufficient pulping capacity, the potential of pulping and papermaking equipment was often restricted from being fully utilized. After the emergence of continuous pulping method, pulping has become an advanced technological link, which in turn promotes the pulping system and papermaking system to leap forward to a higher production level.

The equipment for manufacturing continuous pulping only requires a small amount of wood and iron nails. Because the equipment is simple, ordinary carpenters can do the job. Therefore, this is a pulping method that is faster, better, and more economical.

    全国推广连续打浆法
    本报讯　变“间歇式打浆”为“连续打浆”，这是我国造纸工业的一项新技术。这项新技术是北京市燕京造纸厂和宜宾市中元造纸厂最先试验成功的。轻工业部曾先后在北京和宜宾两地召开现场会议，推广这项经验。
    连续打浆的经验在全国推广以后，对解决造纸工业普遍存在的打浆能力不足的问题，起了显著的作用。湖南省有两个纸厂推广这个经验以后，打浆能力提高30％以上；天津市有九个车间推广了这个经验，效率普遍提高40％左右；上海市利华造纸厂，在采用间歇式打浆方法时，四台打浆机每小时最高产量为六百二十五公斤，采用连续打浆法以后，每小时产量立即达到一千一百公斤，比间歇式打浆法能力提高50％至60％。此外，采用连续打浆法对提高纸浆质量、节省电力和减轻劳动强度也有积极作用。
    打浆，是制浆与造纸的中间工艺过程。过去，由于打浆能力不够，常常束缚着制浆与造纸设备潜力的充分发挥。连续打浆法出现以后，打浆变成了先进的工艺环节，它反转过来推动着制浆系统和造纸系统向更高的生产水平跃进。
    制造连续打浆的设备只需少量的木材、铁钉，由于设备简单，普通的木工就可以胜任，因此这是一个多快好省的打浆方法。
