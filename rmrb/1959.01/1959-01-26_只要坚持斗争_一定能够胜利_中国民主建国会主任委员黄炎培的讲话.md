    Comrades! Friends!
    The US imperialists' blatant acts of aggression in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' crimes of bloody persecution against the Congolese people fill us with boundless anger.
    Cuba is famous for producing sugarcane and is known as the "sweetest country," but under American aggression, it has been one of the most bitter countries for many years. Recently, the Cuban people launched a revolutionary wave and achieved victory. The Congolese people have lived a miserable life for many years under Belgian colonial rule, and their struggle to break free from the shackles of colonialism is entirely reasonable and just. However, the imperialists are unwilling to accept the collapse of colonial rule, and they have tried every means to deprive the Cuban people of their right to punish counter-revolutionary war criminals and to destroy the Cuban people's cause of national independence. They have arrested and massacred large numbers of Congolese people, bloodily persecuting the Congolese people's struggle for national independence.
    The imperialists' aggression and enslavement of the people of all countries are doomed to failure. Today's era is an era in which the socialist and peaceful forces are constantly growing stronger and an era in which the national independence movement is developing vigorously. The awakened and standing Cuban and Congolese people will never be intimidated by imperialist interference, slander, and oppression. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and firmly support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people. The Chinese people, from their own experience in the struggle against imperialism, understand that imperialism has no humanity, but is also a paper tiger, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, looking like a tiger in appearance but being paper in essence. As long as we persist in the struggle and resolutely fight back, imperialist aggression and interference can be completely defeated.
    The heroic and just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people is by no means isolated. Peace-loving countries and people all over the world will fully support you. All members of our China Democratic National Construction Association and the entire Chinese people stand firmly with you. We dare to say with certainty that the final victory will surely belong to the Cuban and Congolese people who oppose imperialist aggression. Please see how the flames of resistance against colonial rule are successively igniting and burning brighter and brighter among the people of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Comrades! Friends! Please see: The day of the final demise of imperialists and colonialists is very near.

    只要坚持斗争  一定能够胜利
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培的讲话同志们！朋友们！
    美帝国主义明目张胆地干涉古巴内政的侵略行为和比利时殖民者对刚果人民的血腥迫害的罪行，使我们感到无比的愤怒。
    古巴是出名产蔗糖的地方，被人家称为“最甜的国家”，但在美国的侵略下，多少年来是最苦的国家之一。最近，古巴人民掀起了革命浪潮，取得了胜利。刚果人民在比利时殖民统治下，多少年来过着悲惨的生活，他们为了摆脱殖民主义的桎梏所进行的斗争，完全是合理的、正义的。但是，帝国主义不甘心殖民统治的垮台，他们千方百计地企图剥夺古巴人民制裁反革命战犯的权利，摧残古巴人民的民族独立事业；他们大量逮捕屠杀刚果人民，血腥迫害刚果人民为争取民族独立的斗争。
    帝国主义的侵略、奴役各国人民是注定要失败的。当今的时代，是社会主义和平力量不断地壮大的时代，是民族独立运动蓬蓬勃勃地发展的时代。已经觉醒了和站起来了的古巴人民跟刚果人民，绝不是帝国主义的干涉、诽谤和压迫所能吓倒的。中国人民十分同情并坚决支持古巴人民和刚果人民的正义斗争。中国人民从自己反对帝国主义斗争中得来的亲身经验，懂得帝国主义是没有人性的，但又是纸老虎，欺软、怕硬，外貌像老虎，本质是纸。只要坚持斗争，坚决予以回击，帝国主义的侵略、干涉是完全可以打败的。
    古巴人民、刚果人民的英勇正义斗争绝不是孤立的。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民都将全力支持你们。我们中国民主建国会全体会员和全中国人民一道坚决同你们站在一边。我们敢于肯定地说，最后的胜利，一定属于反对帝国主义侵略的古巴人民和刚果人民，请看看拉丁美洲、非洲、亚洲各国人民反抗殖民统治的怒火都在陆续地烧起来，越烧越旺。同志们！朋友们！请看：很近的将来，就是帝国主义者殖民主义者最后灭亡的日子。
