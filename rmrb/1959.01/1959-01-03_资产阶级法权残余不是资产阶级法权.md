Remnants of Bourgeois Right Are Not Bourgeois Right
Hou Mingfang

Editor's Note: Hou Mingfang's article, "Remnants of Bourgeois Right Are Not Bourgeois Right," raises some important questions for study. The author believes that bourgeois right and the remnants of bourgeois right are not related as a whole to a part, and that there is a fundamental difference between the two. Failure to distinguish between them would be a distortion of our country's proletarian revolutionary practice and incompatible with the Marxist theory that the old state machine must be smashed, and so on. Clarifying these issues will greatly benefit our discussion, so we hope readers will continue to express their opinions on other aspects, as well as on this aspect.

Bourgeois right is the expression of the will of the bourgeoisie; the remnants of bourgeois right are the embodiment of the will of the proletariat.

Bourgeois right is based on the private ownership of the means of production. It formally stipulates freedom and equality, but at the same time advocates economic inequality and social inequality. This is a basic characteristic of bourgeois right. It is evident that bourgeois right is premised on de facto inequality and class inequality (class antagonism).

Since the victory of the democratic revolution in our country, the economic foundation on which capitalism depends has been gradually eliminated, and the phenomena of human exploitation and oppression have also been eliminated. However, because the economy cannot be fully mature in the first stage of communism, and it is impossible to completely get rid of the traces of capitalism, the various unreasonable established facts caused by capitalism, although their nature has changed, still exist. For example, the past opposition between urban and rural areas has become mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, but the difference between urban and rural areas still exists. Thus, an interesting phenomenon appears: in our socialist country, we still "retain the narrow view of bourgeois right." That is to say, in the socialist stage, due to the limitations of conditions, the proletarian state cannot guarantee de facto complete equality, and has not yet exceeded the limitations of bourgeois inequality. On the other hand, in order to change this situation, the proletarian state has to legally recognize the existence of these de facto inequalities (only the necessary and unavoidable parts) for a certain period, and use it on this basis to create conditions for finally eliminating it. Therefore, Lenin said: "Due to this characteristic of capitalism, in the resolute struggle for economic equality, it is necessary to openly recognize the inequality of capitalism, and under certain conditions, it is even necessary to take openly recognized inequality as the basis of the proletarian state system (i.e., the Soviet constitution)." (Lenin: "Greeting International Women's Day," "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Women's Liberation," p. 112)

However, this de facto inequality is fundamentally different from the inequality in capitalist society. Inequality in capitalist society is manifested as exploitation and oppression, which no longer exists in our country. Therefore, compared with capitalist society, socialist society is the greatest equality. However, compared with the communist society where everyone has the equal obligation to work according to their ability and all laborers have the equal right to receive distribution according to their needs, which is de facto complete equality, there is still inequality in socialist society. Socialism is not the ultimate ideal we pursue. It can be seen that bourgeois right is fundamentally different from the remnants of bourgeois right. The former is the expression of the will of the bourgeoisie, which advocates, protects, consolidates, and develops this inequality, thereby maintaining the private ownership of the bourgeoisie and the extraction of surplus value created by workers; while the latter is required for the interests of the proletariat, which, although it also recognizes de facto inequality as a prerequisite, is used to create conditions for finally eliminating this inequality, thereby serving communist construction.

Treating the remnants of bourgeois right and bourgeois right as a whole-part relationship is a distortion of our country's revolutionary practice.

Some people's understanding is different from ours. In their opinion, the remnants of bourgeois right and bourgeois right are related as a whole to a part, or the former is the fragment and part of the latter, and so on. According to this logic, since bourgeois right is the expression of the will of the bourgeoisie, its remaining part is of course the same. This is obviously wrong. As mentioned earlier, bourgeois right reflects the will of the bourgeoisie and is determined by capitalist relations of production. Therefore, it is guaranteed by the coercive force of the bourgeois state, aiming to maintain capitalist relations of production and the exploitation and oppression of the working people by capitalists. This kind of right will not exist in socialist countries because it is fundamentally incompatible with the economic foundation of public ownership. If, according to these people's views, the fragments and parts of bourgeois right can be allowed to exist and still exist in our country, this is first incompatible with the Marxist theory that the old state machine must be smashed, and it is also a distortion of the practice of the proletarian revolution in our country, because our country has done extremely thorough work in smashing the old state machine, such as abolishing the Six Codes and criticizing the old legal views, and so on. From a practical point of view, this view is also wrong. Which capitalist country has ever implemented such rights as "distribution according to work," "four horses dividing the fat," and "fixed interest," which are called the remnants of bourgeois right?

So, what kind of nature does this part of the right, called the remnant of bourgeois right, belong to? I think it is socialist in nature.

First of all, as mentioned earlier, this kind of right is deeply hated by the bourgeoisie, so it can only be realized in a socialist society that has eliminated exploitation and oppression. Secondly, this kind of right is formulated by the proletarian state and guaranteed by its coercive force. The right formulated and protected by the proletarian state can only be the embodiment of the will of the proletariat, that is, the legalization of the will of the proletariat. Third, the socialist state is based on the economic foundation of public ownership, so the rules and regulations it formulates—rights—naturally meet the requirements of the relations of production of public ownership. Conversely, this kind of right is precisely determined by the relations of production of public ownership and is its superstructure. Therefore, it determines: Fourth, this superstructure must serve its foundation—protect, consolidate, and develop public ownership. On the other hand, from a practical point of view, it is also the case. For example, fixed interest is an extremely important policy for transforming capitalism. Although the state has to pay some interest to implement this policy, and the proletariat has to endure this exploitation temporarily, this is precisely for the proletariat to no longer be exploited in the future, and it is also beneficial to the normal operation of social production. Another example is the principle of distribution according to work, which has played an extremely important role in opposing the bourgeois idea of ​​getting something for nothing and prompting people to care about production from a material point of view. These facts are undeniable. Since this kind of right is the embodiment of the will of the proletariat, is formulated and protected by the proletarian state, aims to maintain public ownership and the interests of the proletariat, and can only be realized in a socialist society, we have every reason to say that it is a right of a socialist nature.

Some people say that the ultimate goal of the proletariat is to realize communism, so only communism is the will of the proletariat, and how can the remnants of bourgeois right, such as fixed interest that makes the proletariat temporarily endure exploitation, and the principle of distribution according to work that is premised on de facto inequality, be said to be the will of the proletariat? In fact, these people do not understand that will is determined by the material living conditions of a class, and it cannot exist independently of material conditions. Therefore, the laws formulated based on objective laws and combined with the actual situation at that time and place are the embodiment of the will of the proletariat. When Marx talked about the inequality of bourgeois rights and its inevitability, he said that rights can never exceed the economic system of society and the degree of social and cultural development determined by it. Who can say that the policies of "fixed interest" and "four horses dividing the fat" are not the embodiment of the will of the proletariat? This is not only because it is formulated and protected by the proletarian state, but also because the proletariat can modify it and change it when it considers it inappropriate.

Some people have also raised such a question: Since it is said that the remnants of bourgeois right are the embodiment of the will of the proletariat, and it is said that they should be gradually eliminated, is this not a contradiction? In fact, this is not a contradiction. If there is a contradiction here, then this contradiction is precisely a reflection of the contradiction of objective things. Because according to the will of the proletariat, the ultimate goal is to realize communism, but the socialist society that has just emerged from capitalism does not yet have these conditions. This is an objectively existing contradiction. Therefore, the proletariat must make arduous efforts, use all available forces, and mobilize all positive factors to create conditions for realizing communism. To this end, it is necessary to "openly recognize the inequality left over from capitalism" and use it to serve communist construction. But this kind of inequality is contrary to the requirements of communism. Our solution to this contradiction is to recognize and utilize these unreasonable phenomena, while also limiting their negative effects and preparing to gradually replace them with complete equality.

The remnants of bourgeois right are the superstructure of the socialist economic base, and they change with the development of the base.

From this, it can be seen that the "remnants of bourgeois right" are not as terrible as some people imagine, because they are the superstructure of the socialist economic base, and they first play a positive role in the consolidation and development of the socialist economic base. But this does not mean that there is no contradiction between it and the base. It is even more incompatible with the principles and requirements of communism. Therefore, when the base develops, the right must also be appropriately changed. The purpose of pointing out that there are still "remnants of bourgeois right" in our country at present is to let people know that the equality stipulated by this kind of right is not the ideal we pursue, it contains inequality and has shortcomings. Therefore, we should not absolutize it, but should gradually weaken and eliminate it with the continuous development of production. Only when people recognize this and understand this truth can they reduce resistance when gradually changing this not-completely-reasonable situation, and at the same time increase the communist elements in people's thinking and create conditions for realizing communism.

This attitude should be adopted towards the principle of "distribution according to work." It is undeniable that in the socialist stage, due to the low awareness of the people and the immaturity of the economy, the implementation of the principle of distribution according to work has indeed played a positive role in opposing the bourgeois idea of ​​getting something for nothing, establishing the idea of ​​labor being glorious, and prompting people to care about production from a material point of view. However, it should also be seen that this principle is still premised on de facto inequality, and therefore, with the development of production and the improvement of the awareness of the masses of the people, its positive role will gradually shrink, and side effects will play a role in hindering the development of productive forces to a certain extent. Therefore, it must be constantly changed. The current distribution system in my country's rural areas, which combines partial supply and partial wages, is precisely the inevitable result of the great leap in production and the unprecedented improvement of the communist awareness of the masses of the people. This is very correct. However, some people in the rural areas currently believe that the larger the supplied portion, the better, the more all-encompassing the better, and even advocate simply abolishing the principle of "distribution according to work." This idea is divorced from reality and is therefore wrong. These people have not seen that the average living expenses per person per year in rural areas are only about sixty or seventy yuan, and there is not much left after eating. These people, in particular, have not seen that after the implementation of the all-inclusive system, some commune members who are not yet highly conscious often make excuses not to go to work, and their enthusiasm for labor is reduced, because they feel that they can eat and dress now whether they work or not. This is not conducive to the development of production. We must not consider problems apart from the development of production and the level of awareness of the people. At present, when my country's production level is not high and the awareness of the masses of the people has not reached the required level, the principle of distribution according to work is still the foundation of the distribution system, and it is wrong to ignore this point.

    资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权
    侯明方
    编者按：侯明方同志写的“资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权”一文，提出了一些大可研究的问题。作者认为，资产阶级法权和资产阶级法权残余不是整体和部分的关系，两者有着根本上的区别。如果不加区别，就是对我国无产阶级革命实践的歪曲，也是和马克思主义的必须打碎旧的国家机器的学说不相容的，等等。弄清楚这些问题，对我们的讨论很有好处，因此我们希望读者除继续对其他方面的问题发表意见以外，也对这方面的问题发表意见。
    资产阶级法权是资产阶级意志的表现；资产阶级法权残余是无产阶级意志的体现。
    资产阶级法权，是建立在生产资料私有制的基础之上的。它形式上规定自由、平等，但同时又主张经济的不平等和社会的不平等。这是资产阶级法权的一个基本特点。可见资产阶级法权是以事实上的不平等和阶级不平等（阶级对立）为前提的。
    我们国家自民主革命胜利后，就逐步地消灭了资本主义赖以存在的经济基础，人剥削人和人压迫人的现象也就随之被消灭了。但是，因为在共产主义第一阶段，经济上还不可能是完全成熟的，还不可能完全摆脱资本主义的痕迹，因此资本主义所造成的种种不合理的既成事实，虽然其性质改变了，也仍然存在。如过去的城乡对立变成了城乡互助，但城乡差别仍然存在。这样，就出现了一个有趣的现象：在我们社会主义的国家里，还“保留着资产阶级法权的狭隘观点”。这就是说，在社会主义阶段，因为条件的限制，无产阶级的国家还不能保证达到事实上的完全平等，还没有超出资产阶级不平等这个范围的限制。另方面，为了改变这种情况，无产阶级国家不得不在一定时期内，在法律上认许这些事实上的不平等的存在（仅是需要而且不可免的部分），并在此基础上利用它，创造条件最后消灭它。因此列宁说：“由于资本主义的这一特点，在争取经济平等的坚决斗争中，就必须公开承认资本主义的不平等，在一定条件下，甚至必须把公开承认的不平等作为无产阶级国家制度（即苏维埃宪法）的基础。”（列宁：“迎接国际妇女节”“马、恩、列、斯论妇女解放”第112页）
    但是，这个事实上的不平等与资本主义社会的不平等却有着原则的区别。资本主义社会的不平等表现为剥削、压迫，这在我们国家已经不存在了。因此，同资本主义社会比较，社会主义社会才是最大的平等。可是如果和人人都有按自己能力劳动的平等义务和一切劳动者都有得到按需分配的平等权利的、事实上完全平等的共产主义社会比较，则社会主义社会里还是有不平等存在。社会主义还不是我们所追求的最终理想。可见，资产阶级法权，同资产阶级法权残余是根本上不同的。前者是资产阶级意志的表现，是主张、保护、巩固和发展这种不平等的，从而是维护资产阶级的私有制和榨取工人所创造的剩余价值的；而后者是为无产阶级利益所要求的，它虽然也承认以事实上的不平等为前提，但却是被用来创造条件最后消灭这种不平等的，从而是为共产主义建设服务的。
    把资产阶级法权和资产阶级法权残余看作是整体和部分的关系是对我国革命实践的歪曲。
    有些人的理解和我们的理解却不相同。在他们看来，资产阶级法权残余和资产阶级法权是整体和部分的关系，或者前者是后者的碎片和部分，等等。按照这种逻辑，既然资产阶级法权是资产阶级意志的表现，其残余部分当然也是如此。这显然是错误的。前面说过，资产阶级法权是反映资产阶级意志的，是为资本主义的生产关系所决定的，因此它是为资产阶级国家的强制力保证其实施的，目的在于维护资本主义的生产关系和资本家对劳动人民的剥削和压迫。这种法权在社会主义国家是不会存在的，因为它和公有制的经济基础根本不相容。在无产阶级革命胜利后，这种法权已随着反动政权的消灭而消灭了。如果照这些人的主张，在我们国家还能够允许存在并且仍然存在着资产阶级法权的碎片、部分的话，这首先就和马克思主义的必须打碎旧的国家机器的学说不相容，同时也是对我们国家无产阶级革命的实践的歪曲，因为我们国家在打碎旧的国家机器这方面的工作是做得极其彻底的，诸如废除六法全书和批判旧法观点，等等。从实践来看，这种主张也是错误的。有哪一个资本主义国家实行过诸如“按劳分配”“四马分肥”及“定息”等被称为资产阶级法权残余的法权呢？
    那末，被称为资产阶级法权残余的这部分法权，究竟是属于怎样的一种性质呢？我认为它是社会主义的性质。
    首先，如前所说，这种法权是为资产阶级所深恶痛绝的，因此它只有在消灭了剥削和压迫的社会主义社会中才能实现。其次，这种法权是由无产阶级的国家制定和用强制力来保证其实施的。为无产阶级国家所制定并保护其实施的法权，只能是无产阶级意志的体现，即无产阶级意志的法律化。第三，社会主义国家是建立在公有制的经济基础上的，因此它制定的规章制度——法权，自然是符合公有制的生产关系的要求的。反过来说，这种法权也正是为公有制的生产关系所决定的，是它的上层建筑。因此就决定了：第四，这种上层建筑必然是为其基础服务的——保护、巩固和发展公有制。另一方面，从实践来看，也是如此。例如定息，这是对资本主义进行改造的一项极其重要的政策。执行这个政策，虽然国家要支付一些利息，无产阶级暂时还要忍受这种剥削；但这样作，正是为了无产阶级将来不再受剥削，并且对社会生产的正常进行也是有利的。再例如按劳分配的分配原则，对反对资产阶级的不劳而获的思想，促使人们从物质利益上来关心生产等都起了极其重要的作用。这些事实都是无可非议的。既然这种法权是无产阶级意志的体现，是由无产阶级的国家制定并保护其实施的，目的在于维护公有制和无产阶级的利益，并且只有在社会主义社会才能实现，因此我们完全有理由说，它是社会主义性质的法权。
    有人说，无产阶级的最终目的是要实现共产主义，因此只有共产主义才是无产阶级的意志，使无产阶级暂时还要忍受剥削的定息、以事实上的不平等为前提的按劳分配原则等等资产阶级法权残余，怎么能说是无产阶级的意志呢？其实，这些人并不明白，意志是为一个阶级的物质生活条件所决定的，它不能离开物质条件而单独存在。因此，以客观规律为依据，并结合当时当地的实际情况所制定的法律，也就是无产阶级意志的体现。马克思在谈到资产阶级式的法权的不平等及其不可避免的道理时曾说过，法权永远不能超出社会经济制度以及由此所决定的社会文化发展的程度。有谁能说，
  “定息”和“四马分肥”等政策不是无产阶级意志的体现呢？这不仅是因为它是无产阶级的国家制定和保护其实施的，而且在无产阶级认为其不适当时，还可以修改它，改变它。
    也有人提出了这样一个问题：既然说资产阶级法权残余是无产阶级意志的体现，又说要逐步消灭它，这不是自相矛盾吗？其实，这并不矛盾。如果说这里存在着矛盾的话，那么这种矛盾也正是客观事物的矛盾的反映。因为按照无产阶级的意志，最终是要实现共产主义的，但刚从资本主义脱胎而来的社会主义社会还不具有这些条件。这就是客观存在的矛盾。因此无产阶级就必须经过一番艰苦的努力，利用一切可以利用的力量，调动一切积极因素，以为实现共产主义创造条件。为此，就必须“公开承认资本主义遗留下来的不平等”，并利用它为共产主义建设服务。但这种不平等又和共产主义的要求相违背。我们解决这个矛盾的办法，就是在承认和利用这些不合理的现象的同时，也要限制它的消极作用，并且准备逐步地以完全的平等来代替它。
    资产阶级法权残余，是社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，它随着基础的发展而变化。
    由此可见，“资产阶级法权残余”，并不像某些人所想像的那样可怕，因为它是社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，对社会主义经济基础的巩固和发展首先是起着积极的作用的。但这决不是说，它和基础就没有矛盾了。它和共产主义的原则和要求比较起来，更是不相适应的。因此当基础发展了，法权也必须适当地改变。目前指出在我们国家还存在着“资产阶级法权残余”的目的，正是要让人们知道这种法权所规定的平等还不是我们所追求的理想，它包含着不平等，还有缺点。因此我们不要把它绝对化，而应随着生产的不断发展，逐步地削弱它和消灭它。只有人们认识了这一点，懂得了这个道理，才能在逐步改变这种还不完全合理的情况时减少阻力，同时又可以增加人们思想中的共产主义因素，为实现共产主义创造条件。
    对于“按劳分配”原则，就应当采取这种态度。无可否认，在社会主义阶段，由于人们的觉悟还不高，经济上还不成熟，实行按劳分配原则对于反对资产阶级的不劳而获，树立劳动光荣的思想，促使人们从物质利益上来关心生产，确是起了积极的作用的。但是也应该看到，这个原则还是以事实上的不平等为前提的，因而随着生产的发展和人民群众觉悟的提高，它的积极作用将会逐渐缩小，副作用将会在一定程度上起阻碍生产力发展的作用。因此，必须不断地改变它。目前我国农村中实行的部分供给和部分工资制相结合的分配制度，正是生产大跃进和人民群众的共产主义觉悟空前提高的必然结果。这样作是十分正确的。但是目前农村中有人认为供给的部分越大越好，包得越多越先进，甚至主张干脆废除“按劳分配”原则，这种想法则是脱离实际的，因而是错误的。这些人没有看到，目前农村每人每年的生活费平均只有六、七十元左右，除掉吃饭以外剩下的就不多了，如果包得过多，工资部分就会很少了。这些人尤其没有看到，在实行全包以后，有部分觉悟还不高的社员经常借故不出勤，劳动热情减低，因为他们觉得现在干不干活都可以吃饭、穿衣。这对发展生产是不利的。我们决不能离开生产的发展和人们的觉悟水平来考虑问题。在目前我国生产水平还不高、人民群众的觉悟还没有达到应有的高度的情况下，按劳分配原则仍是分配制度的基础，忽视这点是错误的。
