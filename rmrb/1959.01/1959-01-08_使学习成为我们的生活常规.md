Make Learning a Regular Part of Our Lives
Tian Jiaying

    The whole country is experiencing a Great Leap Forward. Many new phenomena are inspiring us, and many new problems are attracting our attention.

    Our work within the government is also undergoing a Great Leap Forward. We are rectifying our work style, improving our professional skills, organizing study sessions, participating in labor, smelting steel, organizing militia, eliminating the four pests, and engaging in sports. We have done many things we have never done before, and our lives are rich and colorful.

    However, here, I want to raise a question: I hope to strengthen our learning. There are many aspects of learning. I am referring to theoretical learning, political learning, and cultural learning.

    Our life is full of vitality. To sum it up, it is tense, lively, and vigorous. Improving theoretical and cultural levels is a gradual process, and the results of learning are often invisible and intangible, so they are often overlooked. Learning is the easiest thing to squeeze out in the midst of tension. Learning is also a quiet matter, requiring serious reading and independent thinking. Learning is the hardest thing to do well in the midst of tension.

    The reason why learning needs to be strengthened seems to be self-evident. Work is done by people. Without healthy people and strong people, there can be no outstanding work. Only thinking about the leap forward in work and forgetting the improvement of people, this view also belongs to "seeing things but not people."

    On March 2, 1923, Lenin wrote an article entitled "Better Fewer, But Better." This was Lenin's last article, which said:

    "In order to renovate our state apparatus, we must at all costs set ourselves the task: first, study; second, study; third, study. Then we must test what we have learned, so that this learning shall really become part of our very being and shall actually and completely become a constituent element of our life, and not remain a mere phrase or an empty fashionable phrase."

    How profound!

    In the Great Leap Forward, the productive forces and production relations of our society are constantly being renovated. To adapt to the ever-changing situation, our government offices should also be constantly renovated. Renovating our government offices requires a lot of work, and an important link is to seriously strengthen learning.

    My knowledge is very limited, but as far as I know, in our government offices, making learning a "rigid dogma" or "fashionable empty talk" does not seem to be too rare. This phenomenon must be stopped. We should act in accordance with Lenin's teachings.

    1958 has passed, and this year was extraordinary. 1959 is a year of even greater leap forward, and this year will not be ordinary either. I hope that while our work continues to make great leaps forward, our learning life will also have a great leap forward. I hope to make learning a regular part of our lives, "so that this learning shall really become part of our very being and shall actually and completely become a constituent element of our life."

### 使学习成为我们的生活常规

    使学习成为我们的生活常规
    田家英
    全国在大跃进，许多新的气象鼓舞着我们，许多新的问题吸引着我们。
    我们的机关工作在大跃进，整顿作风，提高业务，组织学习，参加劳动，炼钢铁，办民兵，除四害，搞体育，我们做了许多从来没有做过的事情，我们的生活丰富多彩。
    但是，在这里，我想提出一个问题：希望加强我们的学习。学习的方面很多，我说的是理论学习、政治学习和文化学习。
    我们的生活生气勃勃，把它归纳起来，那就是紧张、热闹、活泼。理论水平和文化水平的提高是一个渐进过程，学习的成果常常是看不见、摸不到的，因此它往往被忽略。在紧张中间最容易挤掉的是学习。学习又是一件安静的事情，它需要认真读书，独立思考。在紧张中间最不容易搞好的是学习。
    需要加强学习的道理，似乎用不着说明。工作是人做的，没有健全的人、坚强的人，就不可能有出色的工作。只想到工作的跃进，忘记了人的提高，这种观点也属于“见物不见人”。
    1923年3月2日，列宁写过一篇文章，题目是“宁肯少些，但要好些”。这是列宁最后的一篇文章，那上面说：
    “为了革新我国的国家机关，我们一定要给自己提出这样的任务：第一、是学习；第二、是学习；第三、还是学习，然后要检查，使学问真正深入到我们的血肉里面去，真正地、完全地成为生活的组成部分，而不是使学问变成僵死的条文和时髦的词藻。”
    说得多末深刻！
    在大跃进中间，我国社会的生产力和生产关系都在不断革新。要适应日新月异的形势，我们的机关也应当不断革新。革新我们的机关需要进行很多工作，重要一环又是认真地加强学习。
    我的见闻是很有限的，但是据我所知，在我们的机关里，使学习成为“死板的教条”或者“时髦的空谈”，这似乎不是太稀有的事情。这种现象必须终止。我们应当按照列宁的遗教办事。
    1958年已经过去，这一年很不平常。1959年是更大跃进的一年，这一年也不会平常。我希望，在工作继续大跃进的时候，我们的学习生活也来个大跃进。我希望，使学习成为我们的生活常规，“使学习真正深入到我们的血肉里面去，真正地、完全地成为生活的组成部分”。
