    Everyone Competes to Accumulate More Fertilizer
    County Head Lü Gets Up Early to Collect Manure

    On January 9th, as dawn was breaking, I had just gotten out of bed when I suddenly heard someone shouting at the gate: "Hailin! Hailin!"

    "Who's calling me so early? What's the matter?" I went out and saw that it was County Head Lü. He was carrying a shoulder pole with baskets, holding a shovel, and asked me to go with him to collect manure. I hurriedly grabbed my tools and followed him.

    That morning, the wind was particularly strong, blowing on people's faces like knives, and sometimes there were snowflakes, forcing people to barely open their eyes. County Head Lü didn't care about any of this. He talked to me about the tricks of collecting manure like an experienced hand. When we got to the bank of the Dan River, he went to the south side, and I went to the north side, walking and picking up manure. In less than half an hour, we both reached the Dan River Bridge.

    At this time, some of the road construction workers had already started working, and some were rushing towards the construction site. County Head Lü pointed to the crowd on both sides of the bridge and said to me, "This is a good place to collect manure." Sure enough, after a while, County Head Lü picked up a basket on the north side of the bridge, and then another basket on both sides of the construction site after crossing the bridge. County Head Lü carried the manure basket in one hand and the iron shovel in the other, walking back and forth on the construction site. Many workers recognized him and immediately started discussing: "County Head Lü is just like our peasants, he keeps an eye on every bit of manure."

    人人相争多积肥
    吕县长早起拾粪
    1月9日天快明的时候，我刚起床，突然听见大门口有人喊：“海林！海林！”
    “谁这样早就喊我，有什么事呢？”出门一看，原来是吕县长。他担着笼担，提着锨，叫我跟他一块去拾粪。我急忙带上工具跟他就走。
    这天早晨，风特别大，吹到人脸上就像刀子割的一样，有时还飘着雪花，把人逼得眼睛都睁不开。吕县长根本就没在乎这些。他像个老练的拾粪手，对我谈着拾粪的门道。到丹江河岸，他走南边，我走北边，一边走，一边拾，不到半个钟头我们就都到了丹江大桥。
    这时，修路的民工有的已开始工作，有的急着向工地走。吕县长指着大桥两旁的人群对我说：“这里好拾粪。”果真，不一会，吕县长在桥北边拾了一笼，又过了大桥在工地两边拾了一笼。吕县长一手提粪笼，一手拿铁锨，在工地上穿来穿去。有不少民工认识他，就立刻议论起来了：“吕县长真跟咱庄稼汉一样，一点点粪都看在眼里。”
