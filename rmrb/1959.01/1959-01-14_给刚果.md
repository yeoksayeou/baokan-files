To the Congo
Cheng Guangrui
Then we roared,
We burned with anger...
    --Congolese poet Martial Singa

Who awakened you from your slumber? Was it the murmuring waters of the Congo River, or the east wind blowing from beyond the sky? Your roar pierced the sky, like the first thunder of the new spring, echoing around the world. Congo, you are like a distant star hanging on the horizon. People don't understand what kind of country you are. People listen to your stories like listening to myths. It is said that you are a beautiful and rich land, full of wonderful volcanoes, jungles and treasures, with uranium mines and diamonds shining underground. But you are both rich and destitute. Pirates have stolen your uranium and diamonds, and your people have been massacred and sold into slavery! To whom can eighty years of hatred be told? The blood of millions of loved ones flows into rivers! The Congo River sings songs of blood and tears day and night. Brussels is drinking your blood wine, and New York banks are piled high with your bones! They imagine you are a perpetually sleeping oasis. You are sleeping, but your heart is awake. You listen to the songs of your neighboring brothers, from Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon... or from farther away, from the oil fields of the Middle East, the mines of South America. This is not a song, but the clanging of broken chains. How can you sleep again when the world is boiling! You must let the Congo River stir up turbulent waves, you must let the volcanoes everywhere roar together! Your lion-like roar spreads into the spring breeze, blowing from afar, echoing on both banks of the Yellow River, how excited are the hearts of 600 million people! We are separated by thousands of miles, yet so close. We seem to have known each other before, yet our hearts are connected, because we are all people who love freedom! The sobbing Congo River flows with the laughter of the Chinese people, and the joyful Yellow River also flows with the suffering of the Congolese people. China and the Congo are brothers whose hearts are linked together! Congo, black brother, good brother, youthful China cheers to you, pays tribute, and blesses the dawn rising over the Congo River tomorrow!

    给刚果
    程光锐那时我们咆哮，
  我们怒火高烧……
    ——刚果诗人马尔西阿尔·辛达是谁把你从沉睡中唤醒？是刚果河呜咽的流水声，还是从天外吹来的东风？你的怒吼划破了长空，像新春的第一声雷鸣，全世界都回响着这吼声。刚果，你像一颗遥远的星挂在天涯，人们不了解你是个怎样的国家，人们听着你的故事像听着神话。听说你是个美丽而富饶的地方，遍地是奇妙的火山、丛林和宝藏，铀矿和金刚石在地下闪闪发光。可是，你既富饶而又一贫如洗，海盗们抢走了你的铀矿和金刚石，你的人民被屠杀，被卖作奴隶！八十年的仇恨向谁诉说？千千万万亲人的鲜血流成河！刚果河日夜唱着血泪的歌。布鲁塞尔在喝着你的血酒，纽约银行里堆满了你的骨头！他们幻想着你是永远沉睡的绿洲。你沉睡着，你的心却清醒，你倾听着四邻兄弟们的歌声，来自怯尼亚、乌干达、喀麦隆……或者来自更遥远的地方，来自中东的油田、南美的矿场，这不是歌声，是被打断的锁链叮当。你怎么能再沉睡，世界已沸腾！你要让刚果河掀起波涛汹涌，你要让遍地火山一齐轰鸣！你雄狮般的吼声散入春风，从远方吹来，在黄河两岸回萦，六亿人民的心中多么激动！我们相隔万里又如此亲近，我们似曾相识又心连着心，因为我们都是爱自由的人！呜咽的刚果河流着中国人民的笑声，欢乐的黄河也流着刚果人民的苦痛，中国、刚果是心连着心的弟兄！刚果，黑色的弟兄，好弟兄，青春的中国向你欢呼，致敬，祝福明天刚果河上升起黎明！
