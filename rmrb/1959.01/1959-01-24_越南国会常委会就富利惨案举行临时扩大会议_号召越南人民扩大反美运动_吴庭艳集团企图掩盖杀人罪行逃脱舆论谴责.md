Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd: The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held an enlarged extraordinary meeting today to protest the crime of the South Vietnamese authorities in killing more than a thousand former resistance fighters and patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. One hundred and nineteen National Assembly deputies attended the meeting.

In his opening speech, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, said that in order to save the lives of former resistance fighters and patriots in South Vietnam, to safeguard human dignity, and for the benefit of the nation, the Vietnamese people must wage a resolute struggle against the crimes committed by the South Vietnamese authorities.

Ton Quang Phiet, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, reported to the meeting on the massacre of patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. His speech was constantly interrupted by impassioned slogans from the audience.

All participants observed a moment of silence for the more than one thousand martyrs who died. More than a dozen National Assembly deputies then spoke, demanding that the International Commission immediately express its position on the incident.

The meeting finally passed a statement pointing out that the crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities are a serious consequence of U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam. The statement called on the Vietnamese people to continue to expand the anti-American movement, demanding that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam, and resolutely oppose the atrocities of Ngo Dinh Diem.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd: Our correspondent reports: For the past three days, Hanoi has seen demonstrations by more than 50,000 people from all walks of life, protesting against the South Vietnamese authorities' atrocity of poisoning more than a thousand political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The scale of the mass protest movement is growing daily. On the 21st, more than 10,000 people participated in the demonstration, and today it increased to more than 20,000. The demonstrators wore black or white纱 on their arms to express their condolences for the more than one thousand patriotic victims, holding up banners, cartoons, and shouting slogans as they marched past the International Commission office.

From early morning to evening today, nearly thirty delegations submitted more than two thousand petitions to the person in charge of the office, requesting the International Commission to immediately go to the scene to investigate the atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities and to take measures to save the patriots still alive in the concentration camps in South Vietnam. The delegations also demanded that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam.

More than a thousand literary and art workers held a protest meeting in Hanoi today. At the meeting, prominent Vietnamese writers such as Dang Thai Mai, Nguyen Dinh Thi, and Hoai Thanh all angrily denounced the atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities. The meeting also passed a letter to the literary and art workers in South Vietnam, expressing support for their struggle. Hanoi artists also drew more than a hundred cartoons protesting the atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities.

In Hai Phong City today, ten delegations also submitted petitions to the International Commission group.

Bui Ky, a member of the National Executive Committee of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, told reporters today: This protest movement is a nationwide surge of anger. He said that in the past few days, the productivity of workers has been constantly increasing, and they are turning their grief and anger into soaring enthusiasm for building North Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, citing news from South Vietnam, after poisoning more than a thousand political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam is plotting to transfer the political prisoners in this concentration camp to other prisons in order to cover up its heinous crimes. On the other hand, they have transferred prisoners from other prisons to the Phu Loi concentration camp.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is doing this to cover up its crimes, sabotage the investigation work of the International Commission, and deceive public opinion.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique has dispatched a large number of secret agents and troops to the Phu Loi concentration camp to carry out suppression, and has surrounded it with armored vehicles.

In order to suppress the South Vietnamese people's anger at this crime, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is spreading rumors that these political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp died of "plague."

    国会常务委员会副委员长孙光阀向大会报告了关于爱国者在富利集中营遭到惨杀的情况。他的讲话不断被全场激昂的口号声打断。
    全体与会者为一千多死难烈士默哀。接着十多名国会代表发言，要求国际委员会立即就这个事件表示态度。

    新华社河内22日电　本社记者报道：到今天为止的三天来，河内共有约五万多各界人民举行游行示威，抗议南越当局在富利集中营用毒药杀害一千多名政治犯的暴行。
    群众抗议运动的规模正在日益扩大。在21日，有一万多人参加了示威游行，今天增加到两万多人。游行群众的臂上都佩带着黑纱或白纱，表示对一千多名受难的爱国者的哀悼，他们高举标语、漫画和高呼口号，走过国际委员会办事处。
    今天从清晨到晚上，有将近三十个代表团向办事处负责人递交了两千多封建议书，要求国际委员会立即到现场调查南越当局的暴行；并且采取措施来挽救在南越集中营里还活着的爱国者。代表团还要求美帝国主义滚出南越。

    新华社河内23日电　据越南通讯社引来自南越的消息报道，南越吴庭艳集团在毒杀富利集中营中的一千多名政治犯以后，正在阴谋把这个集中营中的政治犯移到其他几个监狱中去，以便掩盖它的滔天罪行。另一方面，他们已经把其他监牢里的犯人转移到富利集中营。
    吴庭艳集团这样做，是为了掩盖自己的罪行，破坏国际委员会的调查工作和欺骗舆论。
    吴庭艳集团已经派遣大批特务和军队到富利集中营进行镇压，并且用装甲车把它包围起来。
    为了压制南越人民对这一罪行的愤怒，吴庭艳集团正在散布谣言说，富利集中营的这些政治犯是由于“瘟疫”而死亡的。
