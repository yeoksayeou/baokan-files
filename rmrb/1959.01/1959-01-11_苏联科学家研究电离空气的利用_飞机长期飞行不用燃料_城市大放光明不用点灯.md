Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: It is entirely possible to create an aircraft that basically does not carry fuel and can engage in long-term intercontinental flight. Scientists have now completed the theoretical design phase of this new engine and are close to manufacturing a test flight model. This was stated in an article by Soviet engineer Shibanov recently published in the magazine "Knowledge is Power."

The article points out that this aircraft will use dissociated air in the ionosphere as fuel. Because, at very high altitudes, nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air are broken down into atoms by photons in solar radiation and cosmic ray particles. When these free atoms combine into molecules, they can release a large amount of energy. The new engine uses this energy.

This engine is similar to an ordinary ramjet engine. After the aircraft flies to a very high altitude, the atomic-state air enters a reaction chamber equipped with the necessary catalysts through the air intake at its front end. Under the action of the catalyst, the atoms of the gas combine into molecules, releasing a large amount of energy. As a result, the temperature and pressure of the gas greatly increase, and it is ejected from the nozzle at a tremendous speed, propelling the aircraft forward.

The article points out that this aircraft does not require a large reserve of fuel for long-term flight. Only a small amount of fuel is needed to send the aircraft to the predetermined altitude and give it the necessary initial velocity. Afterwards, the engine can use the dissociated air in the ionosphere as fuel. The dissociated air in the upper atmosphere is inexhaustible. Therefore, the endurance and range of this aircraft can be almost infinite. The article also points out that this large reserve of energy in the upper atmosphere also provides the possibility for creating inexpensive artificial lighting for cities at night.

The article points out that by using high-altitude rockets to spread powdered or gaseous catalysts at high altitudes, it is possible to create a phenomenon similar to the aurora, so that the entire city is illuminated under this light.

    新华社莫斯科10日电　制成一种基本上不携带燃料而可以从事长时期洲际飞行的飞机，是完全可能的。目前科学家已经完成了这种新发动机的理论设计阶段，接近了制造试飞模型的阶段。这是“知识就是力量”杂志最近发表的苏联工程师希巴诺夫的一篇文章说的。
    文章指出，这种飞机将利用电离层中离解的空气作为燃料。因为，在很高的高空中，空气中的氮和氧分子，由于受到太阳辐射中的光子和宇宙线粒子的轰击，分解为原子。而这些自由原子结合为分子时就可以释放出大量的能。新发动机利用的就是这种能。
    这种发动机类似普通的冲压式空气喷气发动机。在飞机飞到很高的高空以后，原子状态的空气通过它前端的进气口进入装有必要催化剂的反应室。在催化剂作用下，气体的原子结合为分子，释放出大量的能。结果气体的温度和压力大大增加，就以巨大速度从喷嘴喷出，推动飞机前进。
    文章指出，这种飞机从事长时间飞行并不需要大量的燃料储备。只要有少量的燃料把飞机送上预订高度和使它具有必要的初速就行了。以后发动机就可以用电离层中离解的空气作为燃料。而大气高层中离解的空气是取之不尽、用之不竭的。因此，这种飞机的续航时间和航程几乎可以是无限的。文章最后还指出，大气高层这种大量的能的储备，还为造成城市夜间廉价人工照明提供了可能。
    文章指出，用高空火箭把粉末态或气态的催化剂撒在高空，就可以造成类似极光的现象，从而使城市在这种光的照耀下满城都得到光明。
