	Youth is Like a Raging Fire, Refining Steel and People
	-- Capital Students Returning from the Steel Front
	Our reporters Qǐ Ruì, Jì Gōng, Fù Jūn
	Recently, over five thousand students from the capital triumphantly returned from the steel front. For the past three months, they traveled to sixteen provinces and cities across the country, working alongside the laboring people in the battle for steel, writing these passionate lines of poetry:
	A warm furnace before the chest,
	A cold wind at the back,
	Youth is like a raging fire,
	Refining steel and people.

	On the afternoon of December 25th last year, students from Peking University, returning from Guangxi, presented the university Party committee with a three-dimensional model of the characters “Long Live the Party's Educational Policy!” cast from iron forged with their own hands, and the word “Motherland” inlaid with various minerals. Among these students, one hundred and twenty-seven received commendations and praise from local leading organs. People talked about the story of their companion who “joined the Party at the front lines”: In order to ensure that tens of thousands of migrant workers could arrive in Longchuan in time to support steelmaking, the Baise County Committee in Guangxi decided to build a bridge across a thirty-meter wide river. Wei Quangui, a student from the Chemistry Department of Peking University, Wang Xinghua, and many migrant workers participated in the battle to build the bridge. After they had constructed the bridge framework on the shore, it was already past ten o'clock in the evening. Next, they had to build the bridge in the water. The weather was cold and the wind was biting, and people were shivering even in their cotton-padded coats. "Get in the water, or not?" This thought tossed and turned in everyone's minds. Wei Quangui, who had grown up in the north and was not accustomed to water, remembered Premier Zhou’s instructions to them before their departure: "…This glorious task is also a great opportunity for you to train yourselves…" At this moment, Wei Quangui was filled with strength, and he was the first to take off his cotton coat and jump into the water, followed by many others plunging in with a splash. The river water rushed down from the valley, forcing people to gasp for breath. The steel cable used to hold the bridge framework was also broken. It was difficult to secure the bridge frame at this location. They held the bridge frame and swam a hundred meters downstream, fighting through the night, and finally built the bridge. Wei Quangui, the son of a poor peasant, received the title of model worker several times in the steelmaking campaign. On December 17th, the Baise County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on his application, accepted him into the Chinese Communist Party.

	Shizuishan in Huinong County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a place where iron ore is produced. The locals used manual labor to carry the ore, and each person could only carry four or five hundred kilograms per day, which was inefficient and prone to accidents. The county committee entrusted Gui Zhongyue, Gong Shuren, and other students from the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology with the glorious task of improving transportation efficiency. After investigation, they found that from the top of Shizuishan to the hillside, they could use natural conditions to pave a stone trough, so that the ore could slide down the stone trough to the hillside, but from the hillside to the stockyard there was a distance of three hundred and sixty meters, with a steep slope, and there were no materials in the mountainous area, only a batch of very short waste steel bars, making it difficult to erect an overhead line for transportation. At this time, the students remembered the Party's teaching: follow the mass line, consult with the workers and peasants, and everything will be easier to handle.

	After interviewing the workers separately, the trick was finally found. The workers told them to flatten the ends of the short steel bars, drill holes, and then connect the two steel bars with rivets, and then use local copper welding on the outside of the joint. The students were as if they had found a treasure. They had also learned theoretical mechanics and material mechanics in school, but they had not closely combined them with practice. They did not expect that this technical innovation would be successfully realized with the help of the workers.

	In October, when Beijing was still in the season of clear autumn skies, the frontier had already been covered in ice and snow. The students conducted chemical analysis in the desolate villages and overcame many difficulties. There was a severe shortage of water locally, and often there was not even water to wash their faces or dishes. The students from the Beijing Petroleum Institute used snow water to make distilled water. They also used waste wooden boxes from the supply and marketing cooperative to make test tube racks. When there was no blackboard for running training classes, they untied the oilcloth used to wrap their luggage, coated it with black juice, and used it as a portable blackboard. Late at night, when they felt a little sleepy, they looked out at the earthen blast furnace groups scattered around the Black Mountains, illuminating half the sky. When the north wind rose, they heard the joyful songs of the villagers: "The Milky Way in the sky has endless stars, the lights on the Black Mountain are ten thousand points of red, the roaring furnace fire rises into the sky, forever calling the winter god to lose his power..." The students immediately became energetic again. On Mount Taizi at an altitude of three thousand meters, the students from the Chemistry Department of Beijing Normal University fought against stubborn rocks and dangerous cliffs. When they failed several times in finding ore and chemical analysis and wanted to retreat, they thought of the Party Secretary of the Autonomous Prefecture and the County Party Secretary fighting alongside the masses near the furnace; they thought of the local blaster who was seriously injured but still refused to leave the front line... Facing the north wind, they swore: "The stone is hard, but it is not harder than our determination. The mountain is high, but it is not higher than our heels. Thousands of difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, cannot stop the young field team members." These students finally overcame the difficulties. The entire team conducted more than nine thousand analyses, helped the local area train more than seven hundred testing personnel, compiled thirty-five sets of teaching materials, and held various exhibitions.

	In the three months of fighting for steel, the capital's students took a step forward on the road of intellectual integration with workers and peasants, as the pennant given to the students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology by the Huilong County Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote:
	Breaking through Helan Mountain,
	Sharing hardships and sweets together,
	Refining iron is a good fellow,
	Becoming redder and drilling deeper.

    青春似烈火，炼钢又炼人
    ——钢铁战线上归来的首都学生
    本报记者  启瑞、继功、傅军
    首都五千多名学生最近陆续从钢铁战线凯歌归来了。三个月来，他们奔赴祖国大江南北的十六个省市，在为钢而战中，同劳动人民一起写下了这样激情的诗句：
    胸前炉火暖，
    背后风吹寒，
    青春似烈火，
    炼钢又炼人。
    去年12月25日下午，北京大学从广西归来的学生，将他们亲手用铁炼铸成的“党的教育方针万岁！”以及用各种矿石镶成的“祖国”立体字模型，献给了学校党委。在这批学生中，有一百二十七人获得了当地领导机关的嘉奖和表扬。人们谈论着自己的一个伙伴“火线入党”的故事：广西百色县委为了使几万名民工及时赶到龙川支援炼钢，决定在一条三十公尺宽的河面上搭桥。北京大学化学系的学生韦全贵、王兴华和许多民工们一起参加了建桥的战斗。当他们在岸上把桥架作成以后已经是晚间十点多钟了，接着就要到水里去架桥，天冷风寒，人们穿着棉袄还直打哆嗦，“下水，不下水？”这个念头在大伙脑海里折腾着。韦全贵从小生长在北方，又不习水性，但转瞬间他记起了周总理在他们临行时的嘱咐：“……这个光荣的任务，对你们来说同时也是一个最好的锻炼机会……”这时韦全贵浑身充满着力量，就第一个脱下棉衣，纵身跳到水里，紧跟着许多人也扑通、扑通下水了。河水从山谷里直泻而下，人们被逼得喘不过气来，用来拉住桥架的钢丝绳也被冲断了。这个地方很难把桥架住，他们托着桥架，游到一百公尺远的下游，一夜苦战，终于把桥搭成了。韦全贵，这个贫农的儿子，在炼钢运动中几次得到模范称号，12月17日，中共百色县委就根据他的申请接收他加入中国共产党。
    宁夏回族自治区惠农县的石嘴山，是个出铁矿的地方，当地用人工背矿，每天每人只能背四五百公斤，效率低，又容易出事故。县委就把提高运输效率的光荣任务交给了北京钢铁工业学院桂中岳、龚树人等学生。他们经过考察，发现石嘴山的山顶到山腰，可以利用自然条件，铺成一条石槽，使矿石顺石槽滑到山腰，但从山腰到料场有三百六十公尺距离，坡度大，山区又没有材料，只有一批很短的废钢筋，很难架空线运输。这时，学生们想起党的教导：走群众路线，和工农群众商量，什么事都比较好办。
    在分头访问工人以后，窍门终于找到了。工人告诉他们将短钢筋两端打扁，穿孔，然后用铆钉把两根钢筋接起来，接头外面再用土法铜焊。学生们真是像得到了什么宝贝一样。他们在学校里也曾学过理论力学、材料力学，但没有密切结合实际，想不到这项技术革新就在工人们的协助下胜利地实现了。
    十月间，当北京还是秋高气爽的季节，塞外已经是冰封雪飘了。学生们在荒郊野村搞化学分析，克服了很多困难。当地严重缺水，常常连洗脸、洗饭碗的水也没有，北京石油学院的学生就利用雪水做成了蒸馏水。他们还用供销社的废木箱做成试管架，开办训练班没有黑板，就解下包行李的油布，涂上黑汁就当作活动黑板。夜深了当他们稍有倦意的时候，远眺黑山周围星罗棋布的土高炉群映红了半边天空，朔风起处，传来了老乡们欢乐的歌声：“天上银河星无穷，黑山灯光万点红，熊熊炉火腾空起，永叫冬神杀威风……”学生们立刻又精神振奋起来。在海拔三千公尺的太子山上，北京师范大学化学系的学生们同顽石危峦搏斗着，当他们几次找矿、化验分析失败，要退缩时，想到这里自治州的州党委书记、县委书记同群众一起战斗在炉旁；想到当地的爆破员重伤依然不肯下火线……迎着北风，发出誓言：“石头再硬硬不过我们的决心，山再高，高不过我们的脚跟，千难万难，难不住青年野战队员”。这些学生们终于战胜了困难，全队共进行了九千多次分析，帮助当地培养了七百多名化验人员，编写了三十五份教材，举办了各种展览会。
    在为钢而战的三个月中，使首都学生们在知识分子工农化的道路上迈开了一步，正如中共惠龙县委给北京钢铁学院学生们的锦旗上写的：
    踏破贺兰山，
    同苦又共甘，
    炼铁是好汉，
    再红更深钻。
