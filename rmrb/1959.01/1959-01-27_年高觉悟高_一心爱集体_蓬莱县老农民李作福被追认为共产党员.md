Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, January 26th: The Penglai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently posthumously recognized Li Zuofu, a loyal to the country and loving of the collective old farmer, as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.

Li Zuofu was from Lizhangyang Village, Chengguan People's Commune, Penglai County, Shandong Province. He was seventy-five years old and died of illness on January 10.

Li Zuofu suffered greatly under the oppression of landlords and feudal forces in the old society. He began working for landlords as a farmhand at the age of twelve, living a life worse than that of a beast of burden for fifty years. Only after liberation did he see the light of day again. Because he had a high degree of class consciousness, he actively participated in every political movement despite being an elderly man. When the agricultural producers' cooperative was established in the village in 1953, he rushed to sign up and also went around to publicize and mobilize everyone to join the cooperative. When the cooperative lacked funds to purchase farm tools, he unhesitatingly took out the two hundred yuan he had saved in the bank since liberation. During the lean period between spring and summer of that year, some households did not have enough grain to eat because the cooperative was newly established. After Li Zuofu learned about this, he voluntarily took out one hundred and forty catties of grain from his own home and gave it to the cooperative. Because the cooperative was newly established, the wheat harvested that year was still distributed to each household that grew it, and the public grain was also paid by each household. In order to give good grain to the country, Li Zuofu picked out the plump wheat kernels from the upwind side during threshing and used them to pay the public grain and sell the surplus grain. Over the years, he actively purchased national bonds every time they were issued, buying a total of one hundred and seventy yuan of bonds.

When the people's commune was established, he was very happy. He was the first to join the public canteen and lent the canteen his family's only two hundred catties of grain and stools. When the commune called on members to support the commune's construction, he took out all the waste materials from his home. He said: The difficulties of the commune are the difficulties of the members. If the members are not of one mind with the commune, the commune will not be run well.

Li Zuofu loved the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Before his death, he had submitted a request to the Lizhangyang Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party to join the Party. After understanding Li Zuofu's deeds, the Penglai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that he met the conditions for a Communist Party member and recently posthumously recognized him as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.

    年高觉悟高　一心爱集体
    蓬莱县老农民李作福被追认为共产党员
    新华社济南26日电　中共蓬莱县委最近追认忠于国家、热爱集体的老农民李作福为中国共产党党员。
    李作福是山东省蓬莱县城关人民公社李张杨村人，今年七十五岁，在1月10日因病逝世。
    李作福在旧社会受尽了地主封建势力的压榨，十二岁就给地主种地，过了五十年牛马不如的生活，解放后他才重见天日。由于他具有高度的阶级觉悟，虽然是一个年迈的老人，可是每次政治运动他都积极参加。1953年村里成立农业生产合作社时，他争着报了名，还到处宣传，动员大家入社。社里缺少资金添置农具，他毫不犹豫地把解放后几年来积攒下来的存在银行里的二百元钱拿了出来。这年春末夏初青黄不接的时候，由于社刚成立，有些户粮食不够吃，李作福知道以后，就主动地从自己家里拿出一百四十斤粮食交给合作社。因为合作社刚成立，这一年社员们的小麦还是谁种谁收，公粮也是各户自己缴。李作福为了把好粮交给国家，在扬场时，把上风头籽粒成实的小麦，都拣出来缴了公粮和卖了余粮。几年来，国家每次发行公债，他都积极认购，先后共买了一百七十元公债。
    成立人民公社时，他非常高兴，第一个参加了公共食堂，并把家里仅有的二百斤粮食和凳子都借给食堂。公社号召社员支援社里建设，他把家里所有的废器都拿了出来。他说：社里的困难，就是社员的困难，如果社员不和公社一条心，社是办不好的。
    李作福热爱共产党和毛主席，生前曾向中共李张杨村支部提出参加共产党的要求。中共蓬莱县委了解李作福的事迹以后，认为他具备了共产党员的条件，已在最近追认他为中国共产党党员。
