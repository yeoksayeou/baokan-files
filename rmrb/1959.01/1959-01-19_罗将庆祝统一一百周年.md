Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 18th: It was announced here today that the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic has ordered a meeting of the Grand National Assembly to be held on January 24th to commemorate the centennial of the merging of the two Romanian principalities—Moldavia and Wallachia.

As early as the 14th century, Romania had two small feudal principalities, Moldavia and Wallachia. On January 24, 1859, these two small principalities began to merge, thus achieving the unification of Romania. This was of historical significance for the establishment of an independent and autonomous Romania and for the development of Romanian society.

In order to commemorate this national holiday, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Romanian Council of Ministers recently made a decision to hold celebrations in Bucharest and other states and cities on January 24th. The Romanian Academy of Sciences will also hold a special academic conference. In addition, other celebrations will be organized throughout the country. A unification museum will be built in Bucharest, "March 28th Square" will be renamed Unification Square, and a middle school will also be named Unification Middle School. Commemorative plaques will be hung on buildings related to this event.

    罗将庆祝统一一百周年
    新华社布加勒斯特18日电　今天这里公布了罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团关于在1月24日召开大国民议会会议的命令，这次会议是纪念两个罗马尼亚公国——摩尔达维亚和蒙坦尼亚合并一百周年的。
    远在十四世纪，罗马尼亚曾出现了摩尔达维亚和蒙坦尼亚两个封建小公国。1859年1月24日，这两个小公国开始合并，从而使罗马尼亚获得统一。这对建立独立自主的罗马尼亚、对罗马尼亚社会的发展具有历史性的意义。
    为了纪念这个民族的节日，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会和罗马尼亚部长会议不久前曾作出决议，规定在1月24日在布加勒斯特各州各城市举行庆祝会，罗马尼亚科学院还将举行专题的学术会议。此外，全国各地还将组织其他庆祝活动。在布加勒斯特将筹建一座统一博物馆，“3月28日广场”将改为统一广场，有一个中学也将称为统一中学。和这事件有关的建筑物将挂上纪念牌。
