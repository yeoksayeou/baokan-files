Oil Crop Production Must Meet Standards
--Introduction to the Oil Crop Exhibition Room at the National Agricultural Exhibition
By Our Reporter Xu Shijie

The second item of the "Ten Initiatives" proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction calls for an even greater leap forward in the production of oil crops in 1959. We must "exhaust all means to ensure that the edible vegetable oil produced from oil crops in 1959, excluding what is not used for oil extraction, is doubled compared to 1958..." Can this initiative be realized? Can we guarantee that oil crop production will basically meet the standards this year? The facts of increased oil crop production currently on display at the National Agricultural Exhibition provide an answer to this question.

In the oil crop hall, charts of red flag counties and red flag communes with large-scale high yields of various major oil crops are on display. These dazzling charts show that the per-mu yield of soybeans in Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, has exceeded 800 jin; the per-mu yield of peanuts in Hongan, Hubei, Rugao, Jiangsu, and Fan County, Shandong, has exceeded 1,000 jin; the per-mu yield of sesame in Honghu County, Hubei Province, is more than 350 jin; and the per-mu yield of rapeseed in Xinghua, Nantong, Jiangsu, and Zhong County, Sichuan, has also exceeded 200 jin. Precisely because of the increase in per-unit yield over large areas, unprecedented high-speed increases in the production of several major oil crops occurred in 1958. The red characters on the four tall glass cabinets tell people that, compared to 1957, the output of peanuts increased by 94%, sesame increased by 76%, rapeseed increased by 56%, and soybeans increased by 19%. What a great irony this is for those who consider oil crops to be "low-yield crops"!

The oil crop hall exhibits a large number of typical examples of low-yield areas transforming into high-yield areas, and a large number of typical examples of high-yield areas achieving even higher yields. The red榜 (bǎng, list of successful candidates in imperial examinations) of Mianyang County, Hubei Province, with a per-mu yield of 420 jin of soybeans across 440,000 mu, attracts people's attention. This area was originally a famous low-yield area where "nine out of ten years bring no harvest in the sandbanks of Mianyang," and soybeans were previously not given much attention; a yield of several dozen jin per mu was considered a good harvest. However, thanks to a series of yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, early sowing, sufficient fertilizer, and multiple hoeings, the farmers here more than doubled their per-mu yield last year compared to the year before. Rugao County in Jiangsu Province was also originally a low-yield area for peanuts, but last year the per-mu yield of peanuts exceeded 1,000 jin, becoming the peak of peanut production in the country. In Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, which has a lot of saline-alkali land, more than 30,000 mu of sunflowers also achieved a high-yield record of nearly 300 jin per mu last year. The yields in the originally high-yield areas are even higher. In Xinghua and Nantong counties in Jiangsu Province, the per-mu yield of rapeseed in 1957 was already over 100 jin, so some people said that their potential was not great. However, due to careful selection of good seeds, timely sowing with close planting, and strengthened field management, especially topdressing fertilizer and frost prevention, the yields of both counties reached more than 200 jin last year. This fully demonstrates that oil crops are not low-yielding; what exists is only low-yield thinking and low-yield cultivation methods. These facts also fully demonstrate that the decisive conditions for achieving high yields are the leadership of the Party, the mass line, and the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, rather than the original level of yield in the area.

Visiting the oil crop production exhibition, we will naturally come to the conclusion that an even greater leap forward in oil crop production this year is fully guaranteed. This is not only because we have the experiences mentioned above, but more importantly, we have countless new communist people who are creating those assets and miracles. Look, a row of large characters "Peanut Abundance in a Sea of Red, Hongan's Banner is the Brightest" attracts the audience to the chart of Hongan County, Hubei. Below the large characters is a photo of Cheng Peng, the county party secretary, presiding over an on-site meeting in a peanut experimental field. He is standing barefoot in the field, and it looks like he just put down his farm work before speaking. The field is full of township and commune cadres and members. Everyone in the field is either holding farm tools or paper and pens, listening attentively to Cheng Peng. Looking at this photo, people can also remember that the experimental field—the road of "red and expert"—is the road they took the lead in opening up. That row of charts shows that, under the leadership of these red experts, the county's peanut production has been leading the country for three consecutive years, and this year the average yield of more than 40,000 mu has reached more than 1,500 jin per mu.

Since our ancestors sowed the first batch of oil crops, for four or five thousand years, people have been thinking about how to make "oil crops into a sea." Now, we are about to reach the day of realizing "oil crops into a sea."

### 油料生产一定要过关——全国农业展览会油料室介绍

    油料生产一定要过关
    ——全国农业展览会油料室介绍
    本报记者　徐士杰
    全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的“十大倡议”的第二项倡议中，要求油料作物的生产在1959年要有更大的跃进。要“想尽一切办法，使1959年所生产的油料作物，除了不用于榨油的以外，能够生产的食用植物油比1958年增加一倍……”。能不能实现这个倡议呢？能不能保证油料作物的生产在今年基本过关呢？现在，正在全国农业展览会展出的油料增产事实，给这个问题作了答复。
    油料大厅里展出了各种主要油料作物大面积丰产的红旗县、红旗社的图表。这些琳琅满目的图表表明：山东省诸城县的大豆亩产已超过八百斤，湖北的红安、江苏的如皋、山东的范县花生亩产已超过千斤，湖北省洪湖县芝麻亩产三百五十多斤，江苏的兴化、南汇，四川的忠县油菜亩产也都超过二百斤。正是由于大面积单位产量的提高，几种主要的油料作物在1958年出现了空前未有的高速度增产。四个高大的玻璃柜上的红字告诉人们，拿1958年的产量和1957年相比，花生增长94％、芝麻增长76％、油菜增长56％、大豆增长19％。这对油料作物是“低产作物论”者是一个多么大的讽刺啊！
    在油料大厅里展出了成批的低产区变高产的典型，成批的高产区更高产的典型。湖北省沔阳县四十四万亩大豆亩产四百二十斤的丰产红榜吸引着人们。这里，原来是“沙湖沔阳洲，十年九不收”的著名低产区，大豆过去更不被人注意，一亩产几十斤已经算很不错的收成了。但是，这里的农民由于采取深耕、早播、足肥、多锄一系列的增产措施，去年比前年亩产一下翻了一番还多。江苏省如?县原来也是花生低产区，去年花生亩产已突破千斤，成为全国花生生产的高峰。盐碱地很多的山西省定襄县，去年三万多亩向日葵，也取得亩产近三百斤的高产纪录。原来高产区的产量就更高了。江苏省的兴化、南汇两县，1957年油菜亩产量已经有一百多斤，因此就有人说，它们的潜力不大了。可是，去年这两个县由于精选良种，适时播种密植，加强田间管理，特别是追肥防冻，两县的产量都达到了二百多斤。这充分说明：油料作物并不低产，有的只是低产思想和低产的栽培方法。这些事实也充分证明：取得丰产的决定条件是党的领导，群众路线，全面贯彻“八字宪法”，而不是原来这个地区产量的高低。
    参观油料生产展览，我们自然会得出这个结论：今年油料作物更大跃进是完全有保证的。这不仅因为我们有了上边说的那些经验，更重要的是我们有无数的创造那些财产和奇迹的共产主义新人。看吧，“花生丰产一片红，红安大旗最鲜明”一排大字把观众吸引到了湖北红安县的图表下去了。大字下边有一张县委书记程鹏正在花生试验田里主持一次现场会议的照片。他赤脚站在田里，看样子他发言以前，刚刚放下农活，田边上站满了乡社干部和社员。满田的人有的拿着农具、有的拿着纸笔都在倾听着程鹏说话。看着这张照片，人们还想得起，试验田——红与专的道路就是他们带头走出来的。那一排图表表明：就是在这些红色专家的领导下，这个县的花生生产连续三年在全国领先，今年四万多亩平均亩产达到一千五百多斤。
    从我们祖先播种第一批油料作物起，四、五千年以来，人们都想着如何使“油料成海”。现在，我们就要到实现“油料成海”的日子了。
