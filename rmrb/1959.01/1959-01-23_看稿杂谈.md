    Random Thoughts on Reading Manuscripts
    Wang Lao Jiu
    After the National Day last year, the leaders of the Shaanxi Daily News Agency asked me to serve as an amateur editor for the newspaper. That is, I would take time to come to the newspaper office, stay for ten or eight days, look at the manuscripts submitted by the masses, and offer some opinions. I read some poetry manuscripts, including works by farmers, workers, and students. The editors said that I was familiar with rural life and asked me to read the manuscripts and then talk about my opinions to help the authors improve. I am also a farmer with a very low level, but I have eaten a few more stones of grain, am a little older, and have more experience. Many young people today are better than me. Let's discuss whether what I say is right or wrong.
    Based on the manuscripts I have seen, it seems that the authors are all very enthusiastic and write a lot. The problem is that many people are afraid of using their brains, and they don't write deeply or specifically. Many are old-fashioned. Some people take creation too casually and send it to the newspaper office after only a few rough drafts. Some people's manuscripts are like a pile of pea vines, a messy heap, with very scribbled characters. I put on my reading glasses and couldn't understand them even after reading them more than ten times. If you are so inattentive to your own work, how can you succeed? Some people write poems that are dry and just shout slogans; some people also use metaphors, but the metaphors are also old-fashioned. What others compare to, they compare to as well. For example, there is a poem about building water conservancy projects:
    Women are better than Mu Guiying,
    Making a big splash in water conservancy, vying for the upper hand,
    Young people are better than Little Luo Cheng,
    Fighting hard and working cleverly to be pioneers,
    Middle-aged people have more drive than Wu Song,
    Striving for the top spot on the honor roll,
    Old people have skills exceeding Huang Zhong,
    Supporting water conservancy, busy without stopping.
    Not a single line is original; they are all clichés. Such metaphors have been written and drawn countless times by others. If you still use such metaphors, they won't be fresh.
    Speaking of using metaphors, it is indeed very important. Writing poetry requires using more metaphors and descriptions, using more new metaphors, and comparing them appropriately and accurately. To achieve this, you need to think hard. Last year, when I attended the Fuping mass creation conference, I thought for a whole night to come up with a metaphor for the poem I gave to everyone. At that time, I saw a lot of poems written by the masses in Fuping, and I wanted to describe this "much". People often say "as numerous as the hairs of an ox," so I used the hairs of an ox as a metaphor:
    Fuping has become a poetry nest,
    Poems are even more numerous than the hairs of an ox,
    Sing one and produce ten,
    You can't finish singing one ox ear in three years.
    When I read the last sentence, "You can't finish singing one ox ear in three years," everyone in the audience laughed. Why? Because everyone found it fresh and interesting, and it was easy to get into people's minds.
    Some people also write poems without paying attention to lively language. They always like to use pedantic language. Now, our working people are just becoming literate. If you speak too scholarly, they won't understand the meaning and won't like to listen. Writing something is like painting a picture. It needs a stem, leaves, and flowers. Without a stem and leaves, it is bare and ugly; with a stem and leaves but no flowers, it is not complete. Writing poetry requires paying attention to political thought and emotion, implementing policies, and being lively and vigorous, with strength. Don't copy other people's good sentences; you can only refer to them. The main thing is to rely on your own brain to think. Sentences that you think of yourself are not old-fashioned.
    Creation is a difficult thing. Don't be afraid of difficulty, don't be afraid of writing badly. Practice makes perfect. If you are afraid of difficulty and afraid of using your brain, you will never write anything good in your life. Creation is like building a house. First, gather the materials. After the materials are gathered, you can start building a high-rise building. After having a first draft, you have to think carefully, like walking a road, seeing which one is good, and revising it three or two times. Get rid of the sentences you don't want, keep the good ones, and then put them together. After putting them together, process and modify them again, three or five times, and then take them out.
    It is difficult to start and difficult to finish writing something. If you start well, you can write well. The ending should summarize the whole text, just like singing a play, there should be a closing, you can't just stop abruptly, making people unable to think further. Writing short poems of four, six, or eight lines, you must get straight to the point and use more metaphors, then it will have power. Writing long things, you must have characters and stories. Criticizing bad people and praising good people will be educational and play a role.
    Creation is one person's idea, one person's opinion. Whether the idea is good or bad depends on whether your thoughts and feelings are on the right track. If your thoughts are good and your feelings are warm, you can write good things.
    After reading a few manuscripts, I have offered these opinions. It's not that these manuscripts are all bad; some are not very good, and some are good. I have pointed out the problems for your reference, but don't be discouraged. Also, don't say, "Only you can do it, only you know how to write!" What I said is like you have dirt on your face that you can't see. When I tell you, you know to wipe it off and become a handsome young man. If I don't tell you, you will always be an ugly son. What I have said is just my experience and opinion. Whether it is right or wrong, welcome everyone to criticize and guide me.

    看稿杂谈
    王老九
    去年国庆节以后，陕西日报社的领导同志，叫我作报社的业余编辑，就是抽空到报社来，住上十天八天，看看群众的来稿，提些意见。我看了一些诗稿，农民、工人、学生的作品都有。编辑同志说，我常在农村，生活熟悉，叫我看了稿子以后，谈些意见，帮助作者提高。我也是个农民，水平很低，不过是多吃了几石粮食，年纪大一点，经验多些。如今的青年，比我高的人很多，我谈出来，对不对，大家研究。
    就我看过的稿子来说，看来作者的劲头都很大，都很热心，写的也不少。就是有一件，很多人怕费脑子，写的不深刻，不具体，老一套的多。有的人把创作看的太随便，三锤两梆子就寄到报社。有些人的稿子，就像一堆豌豆蔓，胡里胡乱一摊，字很潦草，我带上老花镜，看了十多遍，都看不明白。你想，自家对自家的作品，都这样不注意，怎能成功呢？有人写诗，干巴巴的，光喊口号；有的人也用比喻，比喻也是老套套，人家比啥，他也比啥。比方，有一首写修水利的诗：
    妇女赛过穆桂英，
    大闹水利争上风，
    青年赛过小罗成，
    苦战巧干打先锋，
    中年干劲比武松，
    光荣榜上争头名，
    老年本领超黄忠，
    支援水利忙不停。就没有一句是自己创造的，全是套的人家的句句。像这样的比喻，不知人家已经写过画过多少遍了，你还那样比喻，就不新鲜了。
    说到打比喻，确实很重要。写诗就要多打比喻，多形容，要多用新比喻，还要比的恰当确切。要作到这一点，就要多费脑子想。去年我参加富平群众创作大会时，给大家送的那一首诗，为用一个比喻，我就想了一晚上。那时看到富平群众写的诗很多，我就想来形容这个“多”，咋形容呢？人常说“多如牛毛”，我就用牛毛来比喻：
    富平成了诗窝窝，
    诗歌更比牛毛多，
    唱上一个产十个，
    三年唱不完一个牛耳朵。
    当我念到最后一句“三年唱不完一个牛耳朵”时，会场上人都轰的笑了，为啥？大家觉得新鲜，有趣，这就容易装进人脑子里去。
    还有人写诗，不注意语言生动。他们老爱咬文嚼字。现在，咱们劳动人民，都是些才脱盲的，说的文了，他们不懂意思，就不爱听。写一个东西，就跟画画一样，要有杆，有叶，有花。没杆没叶，光溜溜的，不好看；有杆有叶，没花，也不完满。写诗，要注意政治思想感情，要贯彻政策，还要生动活泼，有力量，不要抄人家的好句子，只可以参考人家的，主要靠自家用脑子想。自家想出来的句子，才不老一套。
    创作是个艰苦事情，莫要怕难，莫要怕写不好。久练必精，熟能生巧。怕困难，怕费脑子，一辈子写不出好东西。创作和盖房子一样，先拾掇材料，材料拾掇到一块，再下手，才能建起高楼。有了初稿，还要细细的想，和走路一样，看走哪条好，再三遍两遍的修改。不要的句子，把它去了，好的留下，才往一块对。对好了，再加工修改，三遍五遍，再拿出来。
    写东西，头难起，尾难落。头起的好，就能写好。落尾要总结全文，就和唱戏一样，要有收场，不能齐槎打住，叫人看了，想不下去。写四六八句的短诗歌，要开门见山，多打比喻，就有力量。写长东西，要有人物，有故事。批评了坏人，表扬了好人，才有教育性，才能起作用。
    创作是一个人一个想法，一个人一个看法，想的好坏，就看你的思想感情对路不对路。思想好，感情热，才能写出好东西。
  看了几篇稿子，我提了这些意见，不是说这些稿子都不好，有些不大好，有些是好的。我把毛病提出来，大家参考，可别泄气。也不要说：“就你能，就你会写！”我说的这些话，好比你脸上有灰，你看不见，我对你一说，你就晓得擦了，就成了一个清秀才郎；我要不说，你永远是个丑公子。我说的这一大套，只是我的体会和看法，对不对，欢迎大家批评指导。
