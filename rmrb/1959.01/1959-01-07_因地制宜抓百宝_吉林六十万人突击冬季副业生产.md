　　Seizing Treasures According to Local Conditions
　　600,000 People in Jilin Province Launch a Winter Sideline Production Blitz

　　(Our Dispatch) Rural people's communes in Jilin Province have formed a sideline production army of over 600,000 people, comprehensively launching a winter sideline production blitz campaign.

　　Sideline production in various localities has implemented the principle of adapting to local conditions, resulting in many varieties. In the Baicheng grassland area, located in saline-alkali land, in addition to engaging in animal husbandry, they are vigorously engaged in "four boilings," namely, boiling alkali, boiling saltpeter, boiling salt, and boiling brine. The Tonghua area, located in the Changbai Mountain region, organizes farmers to go into the mountains to hunt, collect medicinal materials, tree seeds, and wild plants. Plains areas have universally launched sideline production activities such as breeding, weaving, fishing, and firewood gathering. Due to the development of sideline occupations, the commodity production of the communes has been expanded and the income of the communes has increased. As of December 19, 1958, the total winter sideline income of the province has reached more than 54 million yuan.

　　The various winter sideline production activities in Jilin Province were carried out under conditions of very tight farm work. At the beginning, many ideological obstacles were encountered. Some cadres and the masses believed: "There is a lot of work in winter last year, and there is no strength to engage in sideline occupations." Some people set agricultural production against sideline production, believing that "more farm work means that engaging in sideline occupations will distract energy and affect agricultural production." All localities have refuted incorrect understandings by presenting facts and reasoning, so that sideline production can be carried out smoothly. The Yushu People's Commune Yujia Management District Party Committee, after organizing commune members to criticize various erroneous ideas through a large-scale debate, organized a sideline production army of more than 2,800 people to engage in more than 30 kinds of sideline occupations such as breeding, weaving, fishing, and firewood gathering, and has already earned more than 250,000 yuan.

　　According to the characteristics of many farm work in winter, many places have made unified arrangements for all labor and animal power. While engaging in large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, specialized personnel were assigned to lead sideline production, and sideline production professional teams were organized. In Panshi County, twelve people's communes drew out more than 15,000 people to form more than 500 sideline production professional teams (groups), and also established 134 professional teams combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and formed teams and groups according to each person's specialty to carry out multiple sideline production activities. Wangqing County in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has also comprehensively arranged labor force, organized professional teams to enter deep mountains and dense forests to hunt wild boars and roe deer, and capture valuable animals such as tigers, leopards, sables, otters, and raccoon dogs. Party committee secretaries in various localities took the lead and personally led sideline production, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses in engaging in sideline production. In order to improve labor efficiency, many townships and communes have implemented the "four fixings" method of "fixing people, fixing tools, fixing quantity, and fixing quality." Baicheng area organized sideline production teams in all subordinate counties, adopting the method of "doing sideline occupations in a small way when farm work is very busy," "doing sideline occupations in a big way when farm work is less busy," and "vigorously engaging in sideline occupations in spring and winter," which significantly increased sideline income. The Dalu People's Commune in Ji'an County adopted the method of doing sideline work in a small way when busy, doing sideline work in a big way when idle, and launching seasonal sideline work with a concentrated effort. In less than four months, the average sideline income per household reached more than 50 yuan.

　　In order to achieve two-pronged progress, some places have divided the scope of sideline operations. Those suitable for collective operation are assigned fixed personnel, animals, and tools for collective operation; those suitable for scattered operation by commune members are mobilized to engage in household sideline production in addition to public labor.

### 因地制宜抓百宝  吉林六十万人突击冬季副业生产

    因地制宜抓百宝
    吉林六十万人突击冬季副业生产
    本报讯　吉林省农村人民公社已组成六十余万人的副业大军，全面展开冬季副业生产突击运动。
    各地的副业生产都贯彻了因地制宜的原则，因而种类很多。处于盐碱地带的白城草原地区，除了搞畜牧业外，大抓“四熬”，即熬碱、熬硝、熬盐、熬滷水。位于长白山地的通化地区，组织农民进山打猎，采集药材、树种和野生植物。平原地区普遍开展了饲养、编织、捕鱼、打柴等副业生产。由于副业开展，扩大了公社的商品生产，增加了公社收入。截至1958年12月19日统计，全省冬季副业收入已达五千四百多万元。
    吉林省冬季的各项副业生产是在农活十分紧张的情况下开展起来的。一开始就遇到了许多思想阻碍。部分干部和群众认为：“去年冬季活计多，没有力量搞副业”。有的把农业生产和副业生产对立起来，认为“农活多，搞副业分散精力，影响农业生产”。各地都通过摆事实、讲道理的办法，驳倒了不正确的认识，使副业生产得以顺利开展。榆树人民公社于家管理区党委，组织社员通过大辩论批判了各种错误思想以后，组织二千八百多名副业大军，搞起饲养、编织、打鱼、打柴等三十多种副业，已经收入二十五万多元。
    根据冬季农活多的特点，很多地方对所有的劳力和畜力进行了统一安排。在大搞水利、积肥的同时，确定专人领导副业生产，组织了副业专业队。磐石县十二个人民公社抽出一万五千多人，组成了五百多个副业生产专业队（组），还建立了一百三十四个农副业结合的专业队，并根据每个人的特长编队、编组，进行多项副业生产。延边朝鲜族自治州汪清县也全面安排了劳动力，组织专业队进入深山密林，猎取野猪、狍子，捕捉虎、豹、貂、水獭、狢子等珍贵动物。各地党委书记挂帅，亲自领导副业生产，大大鼓舞了群众搞副业生产的情绪。为了提高劳动效率，不少乡社实行了“定人，定工具，定数量，定质量”的四定办法。白城地区所属各县普遍组织了副业生产队，采取“农活大忙小搞副业”，“农活小忙大搞副业”，“春冬两季猛搞副业”的办法，使副业收入显著增加。辑安县大路人民公社采取忙时小干，闲时大干，季节性副业突击猛干的办法，不到四个月时间，使每户平均的副业收入达五十余元。
    为了做到两条腿走路，有的地方划分了副业经营范围，适合集体经营的，固定专人、专畜、专工具去集体经营；适合社员零散经营的，发动社员在公用劳动之余搞家庭副业生产。（赵玉庆）
