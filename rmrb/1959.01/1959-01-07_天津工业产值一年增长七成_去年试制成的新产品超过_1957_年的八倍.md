Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 6th: Tianjin's industrial output value leap forward plan for 1958 was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. According to recent statistics, the city's total industrial output value for the year increased by approximately 72% compared to 1957.

　　During the past year's Great Leap Forward, Tianjin's industrial production level maintained a continuously rising trend, with each wave higher than the last. If the industrial output value level in January is taken as 100, June was 148, September was 218, and November reached 250. Production in all industrial sectors has greatly increased. Under the implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," the annual steel production increased by about 70% compared to 1957, and the output value of machinery and electronics, chemicals, textiles, light industry, and handicrafts also increased significantly.

　　Last year, Tianjin's scale of capital construction was unprecedentedly large. The total amount of local investment alone was equivalent to 4.6 times that of 1957. It is estimated that the amount of work completed throughout the year will be 11% more than the cumulative amount of work completed during the First Five-Year Plan period. Among the nearly four hundred new and expanded industrial projects, 291 projects have been fully or partially put into production, greatly increasing Tianjin's industrial production capacity. For example, steelmaking capacity increased by 1.37 million tons, steel rolling capacity increased by 320,000 tons, electric motors increased by 570,000 kilowatts, soda ash production capacity increased by 70,000 tons, and paper making capacity increased by 15,000 tons. Some heavy machinery projects being built to change the face of Tianjin's industry are also under intense construction.

　　After a year of the Great Leap Forward, the technological level of Tianjin's industry has greatly improved. Industrial sectors have taken a big step forward in manufacturing high-grade, precision, large-scale, and cutting-edge products to varying degrees. From January to November, Tianjin's industrial departments successfully trial-produced more than 6,000 new products, equivalent to nine times that of 1957. These include a 100-horsepower free-piston air compressor, an 8-meter gantry milling machine, a hot-rolled gear machine tool, high-strength enameled wire, Vinylon, high-grade pesticides, tempered glass, and so on.

　　Last year, the total cost of Tianjin's industrial products decreased by 2.24% compared to the plan, and the comparable cost decreased by 6.83% compared to 1957. The total profit of enterprises increased by 86.6% compared to 1957 and exceeded the target for profit delivery to the state.

　　A significant feature of Tianjin's industrial production Great Leap Forward in 1958 was the carrying out of technological revolution and the full tapping of the production potential of existing enterprises. Through the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the socialist and communist education movement, the political consciousness of the workers has been continuously improved. The broad masses of workers have displayed a communist style of not caring about remuneration and being selfless for the public in their work. At the same time, all factories and enterprises have universally strengthened the leadership of the Party, vigorously carried out mass movements, learned advanced experiences, and everyone used their brains and came up with ideas. New inventions and creations emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In one year, the city's workers put forward more than 1.3 million innovation proposals. Many factories, on the basis of fully utilizing and transforming old equipment, have achieved automation of belt lathes, high-speed automatic lathes, mechanization of fitter, foundry, and patternmaking work, mechanization of manual operations, etc., which has multiplied production efficiency.

　　Another feature of Tianjin's industrial production leap forward is the implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, with all sectors engaged in steel and iron production, all sectors engaged in machinery and electronics, and all factories engaged in comprehensive utilization. The city's government offices, schools, factories, and street committees have set up more than 2,900 small factories, built 400 small converters and small electric furnaces, produced more than 7,700 sets of various indigenous equipment, and manufactured 342 kinds of chemical raw material products.

　　In the past year, Tianjin's role as an original industrial base has been further strengthened, and it has supported the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in other regions with a large number of locomobiles, gas engines, machine tools, electric motors, and other equipment, as well as many technical personnel.

### 天津工业产值一年增长七成  去年试制成的新产品超过1957年的八倍

    天津工业产值一年增长七成
    去年试制成的新产品超过1957年的八倍
    新华社天津6日电　天津市1958年的工业总产值跃进计划提前超额完成，据最近统计，全年的工业总产值比1957年增长了约72％。
    在过去一年的大跃进中，天津市工业生产水平一直保持不断上升的趋势，一浪高如一浪。如以1月份的工业产值水平为一百，6月份为一四八，9月份为二一八，11月份达到二五零。各个工业部门的生产都有很大增长。在贯彻执行“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针下，全年钢的产量比1957年增长70％左右，机电、化学、纺织、轻工业和手工业的产值也都有很大增长。
    去年，天津市的基本建设规模空前巨大。只地方投资的总额，就相当于1957年的四点六倍。预计全年完成的工作量，将比第一个五年计划期间累计完成的工作量还多11％。其中新建、扩建的近四百个工业项目中，已有二百九十一个项目全部或部分投入了生产，大大增加了天津市工业的生产能力。如炼钢能力增加了一百三十七万吨，轧钢能力增加了三十二万吨，电动机增加了五十七万瓩，纯碱生产能力增加了七万吨，造纸能力增加了一万五千吨。还有一些为改变天津市工业面貌而建设的重型机械项目，正在紧张施工。
    经过一年的跃进，天津市工业的生产技术水平有了很大提高。各工业部门程度不同地向制造高级、精密、大型、尖端产品的方向跨进了一大步。从1月到11月，天津市工业部门共试制成功了六千多种新产品，相当于1957年的九倍。其中有一百马力自由活塞空气压缩机，八公尺龙门铣床，热轧齿轮机床，高强度漆包线，维尼龙，高级农药，钢化玻璃等等。
    去年，天津工业产品总成本比计划降低了2.24％，可比成本比1957年降低6.83％。企业的利润总额比1957年增加了86.6％，并超额完成了上缴利润任务。
    在1958年里，天津工业生产大跃进的显著特点，是开展技术革命，充分挖掘原有企业的生产潜力。经过整风运动、反右派斗争、社会主义和共产主义教育运动，职工群众的政治觉悟不断提高。广大职工在劳动中发扬了不计报酬、舍己为公的共产主义风格。同时，各工厂企业普遍加强了党的领导，大搞群众运动，学习先进经验，人人动脑筋，个个想办法，新的发明创造如雨后春笋般地出现。一年中，全市职工共提出革新建议一百三十多万件。许多工厂在充分利用和改造旧设备的基础上，实现了皮带车床自动化、自动车床高速化，钳工、铸工、木型工机械化，手工操作机械化等等，使生产效率成倍地提高。
    天津市工业生产跃进的另一个特点，是贯彻执行了全党全民办工业的方针，行行搞钢铁，行行搞机电，厂厂搞综合利用。全市机关、学校、工厂和街道办起了二千九百多个小型工厂，建起了四百个小转炉和小电炉，生产了各种土设备七千七百多台，制造出化工原料产品三百四十二种。
    在过去的一年中，天津工业作为原有工业基地的作用进一步加强，曾以大批锅驼机、煤气机，机床、电动机等设备，以及许多技术人材支援外地的工农业大跃进。
