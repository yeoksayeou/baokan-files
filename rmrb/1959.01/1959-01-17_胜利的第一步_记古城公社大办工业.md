    The First Step to Victory
    ——A Record of Gu Cheng Commune's Great Effort in Industry
    Gao Li
    A Vivid Picture
    Anyone coming to the Gu Cheng Commune in Suqian, who wants to understand the commune's industrial efforts, would do well to pick a clear day and take a walk on the old Yellow River embankment that embraces the commune, to survey the scene. At this time, the sun shines all over the earth, and everything near and far is in full view. People can see before them: the magnificent "Leap Forward Gates" standing tall on the broad Xu(zhou)-Huai(yin) highway that runs through the commune, proclaiming the unprecedented bumper harvest achieved in agriculture this year. On both sides of the highway, the completed river network project has been laid out, with crisscrossing ditches and river channels forming a neat chessboard pattern; clear water ripples in the large canals, and on the banks, young poplar, pear, and apple trees, interspersed with tender green bamboo, dance in the breeze. And in the vast dark green fields, rows of newly built factory buildings spread out from Shuangzhuang, the center of the commune, to the surrounding areas. The red bricks and the thatch of the roofs shine brightly in the sun. Then, one can find many chimneys of varying heights, including the pen-shaped tall chimney of the glass factory, the square chimney of the food processing factory, and the dense array of cement kiln chimneys. They stretch towards the sky from behind the trees and houses, vying with each other....

    In this area, which in the past had suffered from floods and disasters, with nine out of ten years bringing hardship, with poor land and impoverished people, anyone would be excited to see such a vivid picture. No! More than just excitement, people can easily sense the prosperous atmosphere after the great leap forward in the countryside in 1958 from this scene, and understand how correct the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party's instruction on people's communes engaging in both industry and agriculture and vigorously developing industry is!

    New Situation and New Tasks
    The cadres and members of the Gu Cheng Commune can hardly be said to have any experience in running industry. They only launched a crash production of indigenous fertilizers and pesticides for a while in the spring of 1958, to meet the urgent need to implement agricultural production increase measures at the time. Comprehensively and systematically developing industry on a large scale only started after October last year. At that time, the fourteen agricultural cooperatives had been merged to form the Gu Cheng Commune, and the unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn grain and cash crops was already certain to arrive. People could not help but see the many new problems brought about by communization and the great agricultural harvest.

    The Gu Cheng Commune's large-scale industrial development began with mobilizing the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, to clearly recognize that the commune must engage in both industry and agriculture, and vigorously develop industry. Through the debates, the commune members, who were immersed in the joy of the harvest, saw that, first of all, the large quantities of grain and cash crops that were being harvested had to be processed and handled in a timely manner, which was an extremely arduous task. For example, the Gu Cheng Commune planted more than 8,000 mu of sweet potatoes, with a unit yield three times that of 1957, and a total yield of at least more than 10 million jin. In addition to the portion used for consumption, the rest of these fresh sweet potatoes had to be quickly sliced, dried, and stored, or used as raw materials, to avoid waste. It was impossible to carry out these processing tasks by manpower alone, so there needed to be enough sweet potato slicing machines and processing factories.

    Moreover, for even greater production increases in 1959, even before the entire autumn harvest was completed, the entire commune organized more than 4,000 people to join the battle of high-standard water conservancy projects, while the autumn plowing and sowing, ditch digging, and well digging in the rear could not be delayed. This required immediately finding ways to manufacture a large number of improved farm tools, digging tools, transportation tools, and other equipment. Of course, it was also necessary to prepare fertilizers and pesticides with greater quantity and better quality than in the spring of 1958 as early as possible.

    Merely to meet these two needs, according to the initial plan of the commune Party committee, in addition to the ten factories merged from township and cooperative industries, more than fifty new factories of various types had to be built. However, immediately establishing fifty factories was easier said than done. Where would the machinery and equipment, infrastructure materials, manpower, and material resources come from? No one was willing to retreat; and no one could bring themselves to rely entirely on the county for help.

    Through a series of activities such as cadre meetings, mass meetings, and production team group discussions, the Gu Cheng Commune reached a clear conclusion in the minds of the broad masses: only by doing everything possible, relying on our own efforts, basing ourselves on agricultural needs, using local materials, producing locally, and making do with whatever is available, can we vigorously develop industry! Thus, in coordination with the intense battle on the water conservancy construction site and the unfolding of autumn plowing and sowing, a mass upsurge in large-scale industrial development was also launched in the Gu Cheng Commune.

    The Peasants are Mobilized
    The fact that tens of thousands of peasants were mobilized to run industry was in itself moving enough, let alone that they were starting industry without equipment and with bare hands, and had to build factories and produce at the same time, without delaying time or tasks in the slightest.

    Difficulties were numerous, but people conquered them one by one with collective strength.

    Factories needed factory buildings. Government departments took the lead in giving up their houses, and then the commune members also cleaned up the remaining rooms they could vacate and lent them to the commune for use. The small street of Xinmin Brigade turned into a factory area in a matter of days. Around that straight street, here was a paper mill, there was a sewing factory, in the alley was a weaving factory, and at the end of the street was a saltpeter factory that was about to be moved from Houzhuang to expand production....

    Some factories, such as glass factories, wineries, and sugar factories, were larger in scale and needed to build new factory buildings and install stoves and equipment. The commune mobilized commune members to offer advice and find solutions. Immediately, a construction team of more than a hundred people was organized, and more than one hundred and thirty flatbed carts were formed into a transportation army. People cleaned up the bricks and tiles abandoned in various corners and transported them to the construction site; people sold their scrap copper and iron, and large and small pieces of wood at a discount to the commune, to serve as raw materials for manufacturing various tools.

    In fifteen days, sixty or seventy new factory buildings were built. A large number of new factories with various signs appeared to the west of Shuangzhuang, where the commune's leadership organs were located.

    Before the factory buildings were built and the equipment was complete, the first batch of more than three hundred male and female commune members happily came to work in the factory. Those professional and non-professional skilled craftsmen, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, pot menders, or carpenters, even those who only had a little bit of skill, all went to the posts of industrial construction. Even more, many new workers who were still genuine peasants yesterday joined the production on the first day they entered the factory.

    In this way, the Gu Cheng Commune and its seven brigades invested only 25,000 yuan (including the discounted value of tools, equipment, and infrastructure materials), and based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, in less than fifty days, they established more than one hundred and twenty commune-run and brigade-run factories in one go. These included iron and wood machinery repair and fitting, fertilizer, pesticides, saltpeter production, ramie knife production, food processing, cotton, cotton stalk skin processing, feed processing, and other projects. More than one thousand and one hundred people participated in long-term labor in these factories, and at the same time, a system of part-time work and part-time farming was adopted to absorb some people to participate in short-term labor.

    Creative Labor
    Of course, running a factory well is not just about solving the problem of factory buildings and equipment, but more importantly, how people can engage in production in a faster, better, and more economical way. On this point, the people of the Gu Cheng Commune carried out outstanding creative labor.

    The Gu Cheng Machinery Factory is one of the factories that is most likely to make commune members feel proud. When it was first established, it was just an empty old house, a bicycle repairman named Wang Shiyuan, and a few partners such as Sun Kechang who knew nothing about machines. They had just put down their hoes and baskets and were transferred to be responsible for manufacturing the machinery and farm tools needed by the commune. The equipment was just a few wrenches and pliers. Industry must have a machinery factory, the factory sign was hung up, and the task was also pressed down. Many farm tools urgently needed to be repaired and fitted for use, and even a small screw was critical. A large number of cars armed with ball bearings were needed on the river construction site; various tool molds were being hammered beside the blacksmith's furnace and needed to be scraped and ground; sweet potatoes, carrots, and beets were being harvested and needed slicing machines for processing.... All this meant that a lathe capable of cutting metal must be obtained immediately. Without it, what kind of machinery factory could it be?

    Wang Shiyuan was really worried. Now it was not a matter of whether a novice could operate the machine, but of not being able to get the machine. He discussed with the workers in the factory: buying a new one, where would the commune get so much money; besides, even if they had the money, they couldn't buy it. After inquiring around and running around, in the end, he could only make a ruthless decision: build it ourselves! The commune Party committee resolutely supported their decision when they heard about it.

    He ran to Suqian City, because his father, Wang Kechang, who was over sixty years old, worked in the county iron factory. Wang Shiyuan stubbornly squatted next to the machine tool in this factory, watching how people operated it, and how the machine tool rotated and cut. Through several days of pondering and asking questions, he learned about the general principles and basic structure of the lathe. So, he ran back to the commune, found his partners Sun Kechang and others, and used those simple tools and the scrap steel and iron they had collected to start working.

    However, a machine is a machine after all, not as easy as building blocks. Whenever Wang Shiyuan and others encountered difficulties in manufacturing this lathe, he would run twelve miles to the county iron factory to ask for advice, regardless of day or night. Half a month later, the "Gu Cheng" style lathe was finally born. Then they assembled the second one.

    With the lathe, a beet slicing machine was quickly manufactured, a sewing machine was manufactured, and there was a way to process and repair all metal tools that needed processing. Through practice, Wang Shiyuan and all the workers mastered the cutting technology of the lathe.

    The era when even making a sickle had to go to Suqian City was declared over in the Gu Cheng Commune. The commune began to have a fairly complete industrial network.

    The First Step to Victory
    So, what benefits has industrial development brought to the commune? Let's look at a few examples.

    In order to support a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959, to fully realize the river network, to change dry land into irrigated land, and to plant high-yield grain and cash crops on a large scale. From October to the end of last year, the Gu Cheng Commune Iron and Wood Factory produced more than 5,000 meters of wooden railway tracks and more than 500 meters of iron railway tracks for construction sites, and built more than 600 railway trolleys equipped with ball bearings. The efficiency of the river construction, including digging and transporting soil, was originally only five, six, seven, or eight cubic meters per person per day. After laying these things, it increased to about twenty cubic meters per person per day, and the labor intensity was greatly reduced. In order to prevent people from carrying soil on their shoulders, they designed and manufactured 5,700 youth-style bulldozers. How could this not make the combatants on the river construction site deeply grateful for the powerful support of the Iron and Wood Factory?

    At the same time, a large number of grains and cash crops in the commune were processed in a timely manner. A portion of the sweet potatoes that could not be used up was being made into starch; beets were being sliced into pieces by self-made slicing machines, put into pots for steaming and boiling, and refined into high-quality brown sugar; soybeans were being pressed into pure oil in the oil factory....

    Not only that, but the large-scale development of factories also widely utilized raw materials that were previously regarded as waste, making people see how much wealth the comprehensive utilization in industry has added to the commune. For example, starch residue and the stems and whiskers cut from sweet potatoes (commonly called sweet potato sprouts) became raw materials for the winery, and were used to brew 65-degree white wine, and then further processed into 95-degree alcohol. The final residue from the winery could also be used as livestock feed. The broken cloth and rotten cotton, which could at most be exchanged for a few pieces of candy in the past, entered the ramie knife factory and were used to make materials that were in great demand for construction.

    As for the improvement of commune members' lives due to industrial development, everyone felt it very closely. In December, the entire commune launched a surprise campaign to peel cotton stalks, weave, burn native saltpeter, and make artificial coal balls, because the production of these things was time-sensitive and could be immediately converted into cash. Before the distribution of work was finalized, the commune could use this income to distribute pocket money to the commune members for the New Year, which was truly a measure that achieved multiple goals. Even the sewing factories that every brigade had solved a big problem for tens of thousands of women in the entire commune with the least manpower.

    According to preliminary statistics, by the end of last year, the output value of these factories reached about 400,000 yuan, which is roughly equivalent to the total output value of cotton in the entire commune. If this is the case, then in this commune, which basically had no industry a year ago, the industrial output value has now accounted for more than 25% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.

    The facts convincingly show that although these factories in the Gu Cheng Commune still need to be rectified and consolidated, in this extraordinary era, along the direction and road pointed out by the Party, they have taken the first step towards the industrialization of the commune. There is no doubt that with two legs to walk, the even greater second step and third step will inevitably follow.

    胜利的第一步
    ——记古城公社大办工业
    高李
    色彩鲜明的图景
    来到宿迁古城公社的人，要想了解公社办工业的情况，最好先拣一个晴朗的日子，走上环抱这个公社的老黄河堆，巡视一番。这时候，阳光普照大地，远远近近，一览无遗。在人们眼前，可以看到：横贯这个公社的坦荡的徐（州）淮（阴）公路上，矗起一座座五彩缤纷的“跃进门”，它宣告今年农业取得了空前的大丰收。公路两侧，撒开了已经竣工的河网化工程，纵横交叉的沟渠河道，构成了整齐划一的棋盘格；大渠里碧水泛漾，堤岸上，二、三尺高的杨树、梨树、苹果树夹着幼嫩的青竹，在微风里婆娑起舞。而在广阔的墨绿色的田野间，一排排新盖的厂房，从公社中心的双庄，向四周蔓延开去。红色砖瓦和屋面的干草被阳光射得闪闪发亮。然后，可以发现不少高高矮矮的烟囱，那里面，有玻璃厂笔杆形的长烟囱，有食品加工工厂的四方烟囱，还有密密麻麻、排成阵势的水泥窑烟囱。它们，从树丛和屋群后面，争先恐后地伸向天空……。
    在这过去曾经洪涝肆害、十年九灾、地薄人穷的地方，出现这样一幅色彩鲜明的图景，谁都会感到激动的。不！岂但是激动，人们不难从这种景象里感到1958年农村大跃进以后的兴旺气象，体会到党的八届六中全会关于人民公社工农业并举、大办工业的指示，是多么正确！
    新形势和新任务
    对于办工业，古城公社的干部和社员，都很难说有什么经验，只是在1958年春天，突击生产过一阵子土化肥、土农药，满足了当时贯彻农业增产措施的紧迫需要。全面而有计划地大办工业，还是在去年秋天10月份以后的事。那时候，十四个农业社合并建成了古城公社，秋季粮食和经济作物空前丰收的局面已经肯定到来，人们不能不看到公社化和农业大丰收以后所带来的许多新问题。
    古城公社大办工业，就是从发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，明确认识到公社必须工农业并举、大办工业开始的。通过辩论，使沉浸在丰收喜悦中的社员们看到，首先，登场的大量粮食和经济作物必须及时加工处理，这是一个异常繁重的任务。像山芋，古城公社种了八千多亩，单产量三倍于1957年，总产量至少也在一千万斤以上。这么多的鲜山芋，除了食用的一部分，其余要赶快切片晒干保藏起来，或者当作原料来加以利用，才不致于造成浪费。这些处理工作，光靠人力来进行是不可能的，因而就需要有足够的山芋切片机，需要有加工工厂。
    再说，为了1959年更大增产，不等秋收全部结束，全公社就组织了四千多人投入高标准水利工程的战斗，后方的秋耕秋种、挖沟打井也不能耽误。这就需要立即设法制造大批改良农具，挖土、运输工具和其他器材。当然，也必须及早准备数量、质量都比1958年春季更多更好的肥料和农药。
    仅仅满足这两方面的需要，按照公社党委会的初步规划，除去十个由乡、社工业归并成的工厂外，还得新建五十个以上各种性质的工厂才行。可是，立即兴办五十个工厂，谈何容易，机器设备、基建材料、人力物力都从哪里来？后退，谁都不甘心；而要全靠县里来帮忙，怎么也说不出口。
    古城公社通过干部会议，群众大会，生产队分组讨论等一系列的活动，使广大群众的思想上得到了一个明确结论：只能千方百计、自力更生，根据农业的要求，就地取材、就地生产，因陋就简地来大办工业！于是，配合着水利工地上的紧张战斗和秋耕秋种的展开，一个群众性大办工业的热潮，也在古城公社掀了起来。
  农民动员起来了
    成千成万的农民动员起来办工业，这事情本身就够动人的了，何况，他们又是在厂无设备、手无寸铁的情况下创办工业，而且还得边建厂、边生产，一点也不能耽误时间和任务。
    困难重重，但人们用集体的力量把它一一征服了。
    工厂需要厂房。机关部门首先让出房子，接着社员们也各自把可以腾出的余屋打扫干净，借给公社使用。新民大队那条小街，几天功夫就变成为工厂区，围着那条笔直的小街，这里是造纸厂，那里是缝纫厂，巷子里是编织厂，街道尽头，是即将从后庄迁来扩大生产的制硝厂……。
    有些厂，像玻璃厂、酒厂、糖厂等规模较大，需要新建厂房、安装炉灶设备。公社发动社员献计找门路。立刻，一个一百多人的建筑队伍组织起来了，一百三十多辆平车编成运输大军。人们把废弃在各个角落的砖石瓦块清理出来，运到建厂工地上去；人们把家里的废铜烂铁、大小树段折价卖给公社，充当制造各种工具的原料。
    十五天功夫，六、七十间新厂房盖起来了。公社领导机关所在地的双庄西边，出现了一大堆挂着各式招牌的新工厂。
    厂房还没造好，器具还没周全，第一批三百多个男女社员欢天喜地来工厂上工了。那些专业的、非专业的能手巧匠，铜匠、铁匠、补锅匠或者木匠，即使仅有一点半丁手艺的人，都走上了工业建设的岗位。更有不少昨天还是道道地地农民的新工人，进厂第一天就投入了生产。
    就这样，古城公社和所属七个大队，仅仅投资二万五千元（包括工具设备基建材料折价在内），根据因地制宜、就地取材的原则，在五十天不到的时间内，一鼓作气，兴办了一百二十多个社办的、队办的工厂，它们包括了铁木机械修配、化肥、农药、制硝、麻刀、食品加工、棉花、棉秆皮、饲料加工等等项目。参加这些工厂长期劳动的有一千一百多人，同时，采取亦工亦农的制度，吸收一部分人参加短期劳动。
    创造性的劳动
    当然，办好工厂并不能只是解决厂房设备问题，更重要的还是人怎样多快好省地搞生产。在这一点上，古城公社的人们进行了出色的创造性劳动。　古城机械工厂是最容易引起社员感到自豪的工厂之一。当初创办时，只是一间空荡荡的旧房子，一个在当地修脚踏车的工人王世元，还有丝毫也不懂机器的孙克昌等几个伙伴，他们刚刚放下锄头箩筐，被调来负责制造公社需要的机械和农具，设备只是几把扳头和钳子。办工业一定要有机械工厂，厂牌挂出去了，任务也压上来了。许多农具急待修配使用，哪怕缺少一个小小螺丝都是关键。河工上需要大量用滚珠轴承去武装的车子；铁匠炉旁正在锤打各种工具的模坯，需要加以刮磨；山芋、胡萝卜、甜菜都登场了，需要加工用的切片机……。这一切，就是说，必须立即弄到能够切削金属的车床，没有它，还能算什么机械工厂？
    王世元可真犯愁了，现在不是怕生手能不能驾驭机器，怕的是弄不到机器。他和同厂的工人们商量：买新的，公社哪来这么多钱；何况就是有钱也买不到。东打听，西奔走，到头来只能下一个狠心，自己动手造！公社党委会一听他们的决心，坚决给以支持。
    他跑上宿迁城去了，因为他那六十多岁的父亲王克昌在县的铁工厂做工。王世元一股劲地蹲在这家厂的机床旁边，看人家怎样操作，看机床怎样转动和切削。通过几天的揣摩、询问，他了解到车床的一般原理和基本结构，于是，跑回公社，找了同伙的孙克昌等人，用那些简单的工具，利用收集来的废钢烂铁，干了起来。
    可是，机器终是机器，不像搭积木那样容易。王世元等在制造这台车床中，遇到困难，他就不管白天黑夜，一口气跑十二里，到县铁工厂去讨教。半月以后，“古城”式车床终于诞生了。接着他们又装配了第二台。
    有了车床，很快甜菜切片机制造出来了，缝纫机制造出来了，一切需要加工修配的金属用具都有了办法。通过实践，王世元和所有的工人都掌握了车床的切削技术。
    在古城公社，打把镰刀都要上宿迁城的时代，从此宣告结束，公社开始拥有了相当周全的一个工业网。
    胜利的第一步
    那么，办工业究竟对公社带来了什么好处呢？让我们举几个例子看看。
    为了支援1959年农业更大跃进，全部实现河网化，改旱地为水浇地，广种高产粮食和经济作物。从去年10月份到年底，古城公社铁木工厂生产了工地运输木轨道五千多公尺，铁轨道五百多公尺，造出了六百多辆装有滚珠轴承的轨道滑车。原来河工上的工效，包括挖土运土，每人每天不过五、六方，七、八方，铺设了这些东西后，就提高到每人每天二十方左右，而且劳动强度大为减轻。为了使人们不用肩膀挑土，他们设计制造了五千七百辆青年式推土车。这怎能不叫河工上的战斗员深深感激铁木工厂的有力支援呢？
    同时，公社里的大批粮食和经济作物都得到了及时的处理。一部分用不了的山芋正在制造成淀粉；甜菜正在被自造的切片机刨成碎片，投进锅子蒸煮，熬出品质良好的赤砂糖；大豆，正在油厂里榨成纯油……。
    不仅如此，大办工厂还广泛地利用了那些过去都被当作废物的原料，使人们看到，工业上的综合利用为公社增加了多少财富。像淀粉渣子，山芋上切下来的茎须（俗话叫山芋茆子），成为酒厂的原料，用它们酿出了六十五度的白酒，再进一步制成九十五度的酒精，酒厂出来的最后的残渣还可当作牲畜饲料。那些过去顶多换几块糖的破布烂棉花进了麻刀厂，造出建筑上需要量很大的材料。
    至于办工业有利于社员生活的改善，每个人也感受得很亲切。全社在12月发动了一个大搞剥棉秆皮、编织、烧土硝和人造煤球的突击运动，因为这些东西的生产都有时间性，而且可以立即脱手变成现金。在分配工作还没有定当以前，公社可以用这笔收入分配给社员作过年用的零用钱，这真是一举数得的措施。连那队队都有的缝纫厂，也以最少的人力解决了全社上万妇女的大问题。
    根据初步统计，这些工厂到去年年底，产值达到四十万元左右，大约相等于全社棉花的总产值。如果是这样，那么，一年前还基本上没有工业的这个公社，现在，工业产值已经占到工农业总产值的25％以上了。
    事实令人信服地看到：虽然古城公社的这些工厂，还需要进行整顿巩固，但在这不平凡的时代里，沿着党所指引的方向和道路，他们向公社工业化跨出了胜利的第一步。毫无疑问，有了两条腿走路，接着而来的必将是更加巨大的第二步，第三步。
