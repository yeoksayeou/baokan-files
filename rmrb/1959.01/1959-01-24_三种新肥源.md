    Three New Fertilizer Sources
    The Hongguang Commune in Yixian, Liaoning, has found three new sources of manure.
    The first is roasting ore combined with burning soil for fertilizer fumigation, a new creation of the Tougou Production Team of the Hongqiangzi Work Area. Near the village, they selected a soil embankment as tall as a person, and dug a soil kiln into the embankment, shaped like a jar with a large belly, a small mouth, and a fine bottom, for roasting ore. A soil kang (heated brick bed) was built on top of the kiln, with three holes poked into it. One kiln could be fired in five days, yielding seventy cartloads of cooked soil.
    The second is to modify the chimneys of public canteens by building a kang (heated brick bed) outside the house. While cooking, they simultaneously burn soil. The soil kang can be fired in ten days, yielding fifty cartloads of soil each time.
    The third is to recycle flue gas to make soil fertilizer. This involves placing a water-spraying bucket on top of the chimney, with spray nozzles embedded in the bottom of the bucket, aiming at the smoke outlet to maintain constant spraying into the chimney. Underneath the chimney, place an iron dustpan, with a small ammonia outlet embedded on the outer side of the dustpan. Place an iron bucket under this small outlet specifically to collect ammonia water. In this way, each chimney can recover forty catties of ammonia water per day, which, when mixed with ten times the amount of pulverized and air-dried peat, becomes four hundred catties of nitrogen-rich soil fertilizer.

    三种新肥源
    辽宁义县红光公社找到三种新粪源。
    第一种，是焙烧矿石结合烧土熏肥，这是红墙子作业区头沟生产队的新创造。他们在屯子附近，选择一人高的土坎子，就土坎挖好肚大、口小、底细呈罎子形焙烧矿石的土窑，窑上搭土炕，挑三个洞，五天可烧好一窑，能起出熟土七十车。
    第二种，是把公共食堂的烟囱改变一下，在屋外搭上炕，一边做饭菜，一边烧土，每十天就能将土炕烧好，一次可烧土五十车。
    第三种，是回收烟气作土化肥。就是在烟囱的上边放个喷水桶，在桶的下边嵌上喷雾咀，使喷雾咀对准出烟口，保持经常往烟囱内喷雾。在烟囱底下放入一个铁簸箕，簸箕的外侧再嵌上一个出氨水小咀，对这小咀下边放个铁桶专为接氨水用。这样，每天每个烟囱能回收氨水四十斤，掺上十倍粉碎风干的草炭，就成为四百斤氮素丰富的土化肥。
