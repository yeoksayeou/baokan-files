    Snow-White Willow Forest Red
    Guo Chaoren
    After a heavy snowfall, the Tibetan Plateau was covered with snow several inches deep. Pastures, lakes, rivers, and valleys were buried in deep snow, a vast expanse of white stretching as far as the eye could see.
    Yesterday, the grassland was a colorful painting; today, it has become a profound and pure silver world. In the sunlight, the grassland radiates with a myriad of colors, so dazzling that it's hard to open one's eyes. Gusts of whirlwind swirl up snowdrifts more than ten feet high, like dense fog, permeating the air.
    Suddenly, in the distance on the snowy ground, a dense patch of black dots obscures our vision. These black dots gradually grow larger and wider before our eyes, revealing a verdant and gentle color under the sunlight, like the embroidered edges on a Tibetan girl's apron.
    What is that? Is it a hallucination from the snow? I blinked my eyes and looked more closely. I saw a red glow reflected on the snow, as if a red city wall was standing there.
    As the car approached, someone shouted, "Look! A forest!"
    Ah! I almost couldn't believe my eyes. Beside a large white lake, I saw a forest of red and green trees. Shrubs more than a person's height stood majestically on the snowy ground. The luxuriant branches, as fiery red as pomegranate flowers, stretched out into the air like umbrellas. The thick trunks were short and curved, the bark rough and hard, and green to the point of being black.
    This is the famous red willow, often referred to as the "Arctic Willow" in botany because it can grow in high-altitude cold regions.
    For more than half a month, we had traveled over a thousand kilometers on the Tibetan Plateau, and besides the low-lying saltwort and camel thorns interspersed in the grass, we had not seen a single tree. And now, we encountered an entire forest, which was truly invigorating! In recent decades, some bourgeois experts who considered themselves "Tibet experts" had repeatedly asserted that trees could not grow on the Tibetan Plateau, and that not even a single tree could be found. They even said with great seriousness that a Chinese person in Tibet could not even find two twigs to use as chopsticks. The lie that trees could not grow in Tibet was shattered not long ago. The willow saplings planted in the Nagqu area, which is over 4,000 meters above sea level, in 1958, had already sprouted and taken root, with most of them surviving. Unexpectedly, in this remote lake area of the Tibetan Plateau, nature once again slapped them in the face. Those people could never imagine the rich and colorful face of our great motherland, nor could they understand that so many miracles would appear in nature in our era.
    A Tibetan friend told me that this kind of red willow is called "Langma" on the Tibetan Plateau and is a perennial shrub. Because the climate on the grassland is cold and dry, the red willow grows slowly. A tree that is more than ten years old has a trunk that is only five or six centimeters thick. Those tall and sturdy trees may be hundreds of years old. He joked, "Don't look down on this small red willow forest; in terms of age, it is still a primeval forest!"
    We walked along the path through the red willow forest and carefully observed each tree. We discovered that they mostly grew in relatively loose mounds of yellow soil. The main roots were not deeply embedded in the soil, and the root hairs were thick and crooked, intertwined on the surface of the soil like tangled hair. Near the water, they grew particularly thick and large, with the thickest trunks being over twenty centimeters in diameter, but mostly short and curved. At the top of the trunk, the branches were dense, overlapping and stretching straight into the air, with the longest branches reaching more than a meter, which could be used to cover roofs or weave various utensils.
    I think that if the red willow can grow on this grassland, it can also be transplanted to various parts of the grassland. A forest of red willows not only provides people with a large amount of timber but also prevents wind and sand and changes the climate. Then, wouldn't the discovery of the red willow provide favorable conditions for transforming the face of the Tibetan Plateau?
    By the time we had set up our tents in the open space of the red willow forest, it was already dusk. Whirlwinds rolled up snowdrifts at the foot of the distant mountains, and the lake surface was shrouded in mist, making it impossible to see anything. The weather had changed again. However, in this red willow forest, it was particularly quiet and peaceful. Gentle mountain breezes rustled through the swaying branches. People lit bonfires in the open spaces of the forest and sat around them, talking. Some were strolling along the paths in the forest, as if they had entered a beautiful garden…
    After the car passed the large lake, we encountered these alluring red willows all the way. Some grew on arid mountain slopes, some grew on grasslands and riverbanks, some had already grown into dense forests, and some were just creeping on the ground. However, their vibrant red color, like a ball of fire, was always so soft and charming, attracting the attention of passersby.

    雪白柳林红
    郭超人
    下了一场大雪，藏北草原上平地积雪几寸深。草场，湖泊，河流和谷地都埋藏在深雪里，白茫茫的一眼望不到边。
    昨天，草原上还是一幅多彩的图画，今天，就成了一个浑厚、单纯的银色世界。阳光下，草原上霞光万道，刺得人睁不开眼，阵阵旋风把积雪卷起一丈多高，像浓雾一样在空中弥漫。
    突然，在远处雪地上，有一片密密麻麻的黑点遮住我们的视线。这些黑点逐渐在眼前变大变宽了，迎着阳光泛露出苍翠而轻柔的色彩，就像藏族姑娘围裙上的绣花边。
    那是什么呢？难道是雪地给我的幻觉？我眨了会眼，再仔细地望过去。只见雪地上红光掩映，好像矗立着一道红色的城墙。
    汽车走近了。“看！森林！”旁边有人喊起来。
    啊！我几乎不相信自己的眼睛，在一座白色的大湖边，我看到了一片红中透绿的树林。一人多高的树丛，雄健地屹立在雪地上。繁茂的枝桠像石榴花一样，火红火红的，雨伞般地向空中伸张着。粗壮的树茎短而弯曲，表皮粗硬，绿得发黑。
    这就是著名的红柳，因为它们在高寒地带也能生长，在植物学上常称作“北极柳”。
    半个多月来，我们在藏北草原上走过了上千公里的地方，眼前除了那夹生在草丛中低矮的盐索草和骆驼刺外，我们没有看到一棵树木。而现在，竟遇到了整整一座树林，这真振奋人心！在近几十年中，一些以“西藏通”自居的资产阶级专家们，曾不止一次地断言，藏北草原上不能生长树木，也找不到一根树木，他们甚至煞有介事地说什么，一个中国人在藏北想找两根当筷子用的树枝都不可能。藏北不能生长树木的谎言不久前就破产了，拔海四千多公尺的黑河地区1958年才种的杨柳树苗，已经抽芽生须，大部分都成活了。想不到，在藏北草原这个偏僻的大湖边，大自然又给了他们一记响亮的耳光。那些人，他们怎么也想像不到我们伟大祖国丰饶多彩的面貌，怎么也理解不了大自然在我们的时代会出现这么多的奇迹。
    一个藏族朋友告诉我，这种红柳在藏北草原上叫做“朗麻”，是一种多年生的灌木。由于草原上气候寒冷而干燥，红柳生长较慢，十多年的树，树茎不过五、六公分，像那种高大粗壮的树，也许已有上百年的历史了。他开玩笑地说：“不要看红柳林很小，论起年龄来，它还是原始森林呢！”
    我们沿着红柳林间的小路走去，仔细地观察了每棵红柳，才发觉它们大都生长在比较松软的黄土堆中，主根扎土不深，根须粗大而弯拐，像乱发一样犬牙交错地盘绞在土面上。在近水的地方，就长得特别粗大，最粗的树茎在二十公分以上，但大都短而弯曲。树茎顶部，枝条丛密，重重叠叠笔直地伸吐空中，最长的树枝条可达一公尺多，可用来铺盖屋顶或编织各种用具。
    我想，红柳能在这块草地上生长，也就可能移植到草原各个地方。成林的红柳不仅为人们供应大量的木材，还能防止风沙，改变气候，那么，红柳的发现，岂不为改造藏北草原的面貌提供了有利的条件？
    当我们在红柳林间的空地上搭好帐篷，已经傍晚了。远处山脚下旋风翻滚，扬起阵阵雪片，近处湖面上雾气蒙胧，什么也看不清，天又变了。但是，在这座红柳林中，却分外幽静。阵阵山风吹过，树枝摇曳，沙沙作响。人们在林间空地上升起了一堆堆篝火，围坐火旁谈天，有的人还在林间小路上踽踽踱步，就像走进了美丽的花园……
    汽车驶过大湖以后，我们一路上都遇到了这种诱人的红柳。有些生长在干旱的山麓，有些生长在草地和河边，有些已经茂密成林，有些还刚刚匍匐在地面。但是，它们那鲜艳得像一团火似的红色，总是那样柔和而妩媚，吸引着行人的目光。
