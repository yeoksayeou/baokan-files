Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 19th: The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee was held from December 28th of last year to January 16th of this year. The main tasks of this congress were to: convey and discuss the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party; summarize the basic experiences of the Great Leap Forward on all fronts in Shanghai in 1958, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs; study and determine the tasks of socialist construction in Shanghai in 1959; and elect the Second Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Party.

The congress discussed the situation and tasks facing Shanghai's economic construction in 1959 and preliminarily determined the plan for Shanghai's national economic development in 1959. According to this plan, Shanghai's total industrial and agricultural output value and the output of major products will increase even more in 1959 than in 1958. The growth figures for important products such as steel, motors, ships, cement, cotton yarn, grain, cotton, and vegetables all exceed the growth figures of the previous year. The realization of this inspiring Leap Forward plan will further change Shanghai's economic landscape.

The congress believes that, according to the unified national plan, Shanghai's industrial production should further develop in the direction of advanced, precision, and large-scale, under the conditions of properly and comprehensively arranging production and ensuring the growing needs of the people. Shanghai's existing industrial production should be reorganized and adjusted accordingly, and necessary new enterprises should be built. Agriculture in Shanghai's suburbs should further increase the yield per mu of grain, cotton, and vegetables, and actively develop diversified operations, according to the policies determined by the Central Committee.

The congress particularly emphasized that continuously improving labor productivity is a most important link in the issue of actively developing production. Only by continuously improving labor productivity can we rapidly develop production, enrich social products, and provide a reliable material basis for the gradual improvement of the people's lives. The congress analyzed the current state of labor productivity in Shanghai's industrial and agricultural production and believes that there is still enormous potential in this area. The congress requires Party organizations at all levels and all comrades on the industrial and agricultural fronts to actively improve the mechanization and automation of industrial and agricultural production processes, gradually realize the equipment renewal of factories and enterprises, and agricultural mechanization and electrification; at the same time, continue to carry out extensive mass technical revolution, reform tools, improve product design and technology, improve production efficiency, and continuously improve the organization of production, improve product quality, strengthen the conservation of raw materials and production management, and further rationally and more effectively use labor.

The congress believes that in order to realize the Great Leap Forward in 1959, it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's General Line, adhere to the policy of walking on two legs, mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to serve the development of the socialist economy, and unite all forces that can be united to build socialism.

The congress particularly emphasized that in the nationwide Great Leap Forward, a firm overall perspective must be established. The whole country is a chessboard, and Shanghai is a part of the unified national plan. The interests of the whole are the fundamental interests of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, and completing the state plan is the greatest interest of the people of Shanghai. Therefore, national centralization and unity must be correctly combined with local flexibility. Local flexibility must be premised on obedience to the state plan, and its purpose is also to better realize the unified national plan.

The congress believes that the practice of the past year has proven that strengthening the Party's leadership, implementing political command, and implementing the mass line are the basic guarantees for the continued Great Leap Forward of our various undertakings. To this end, the congress pointed out in the resolution on several issues concerning further implementation of the mass line in industrial enterprises: it is necessary to regularly use the methods of rectification such as big blooming, big contending, big debate, and big-character posters; adhere to the system of leading cadres participating in physical labor for a certain period of time; advocate and promote the style of leading cadres going deep into the front line and among the masses, in order to be familiar with the masses and production, and make leadership work more specific and practical. The resolution requires all leading cadres to be more concerned about the lives of the masses, not only caring about the masses in terms of material life, but also caring about the masses comprehensively in terms of political thought, learning, and technology, and helping workers continuously improve their political and ideological level and cultural and technical level. The resolution requires all cadres to continuously improve their political, ideological, and work level. It requires all cadres, especially leading cadres, to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously study Mao Zedong's works, and at present, pay special attention to studying political economy and materialist dialectics. At the same time, they should sum up work experience at any time, frequently use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and timely discover and correct shortcomings and errors in thought and work.

The congress called on the entire Party and the entire people of Shanghai to unite as one, under the unified leadership of the Party, to continue to exert their energy, strive hard, break superstitions, liberate their minds, and on the basis of the victory of 1958, to leap forward again and again, and to strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

Finally, the congress elected Ke Qingshi, Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, Ma Tianshui and other forty-five comrades as members of the Second Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and elected twenty-one alternate members. A total of four hundred and ninety-eight delegates and fifty alternate delegates attended the congress. Responsible cadres from various departments also attended the congress as non-voting delegates.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 19th: The Third Session of the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of China Jiangxi Provincial Committee was held in Nanchang from December 30th of last year to January 13th of this year.

The delegates attending the meeting earnestly studied the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's instructions, unanimously expressed their complete support, and resolutely implemented them.

On the basis of summarizing the great victory and rich experience of 1958, the meeting put forward a plan for Jiangxi Province to achieve a greater Leap Forward in the national economy in 1959. The meeting called on Party organizations at all levels throughout the province, all Party members, all cadres, and the people of the province to continue to exert their energy, strive for the upper reaches, and strive to complete and over fulfill the greater, better, and more comprehensive Leap Forward in 1959.

The meeting pointed out that, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, closely combining with production and vigorously doing a good job in consolidating, rectifying, and improving the people's communes is a current urgent political task. Party organizations at all levels must conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among the broad masses of people throughout the province, so as to further enhance the communist consciousness of the broad masses of people and carry out various socialist construction undertakings more heroically and more practically. It is necessary to widely and deeply publicize and implement the policy of developing production in people's communes, that is, according to the unified national plan and the principle of adapting to local conditions, according to the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily, implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and the simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production, so as to promote the rapid development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's lives. It is also necessary to widely and deeply publicize and implement the distribution principle of combining the wage system and the supply system in people's communes, organize rhythmic production, and run collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly.

The meeting pointed out that at present, in the entire province, the work of consolidating the communes is being carried out vigorously in close combination with production. In the work of consolidating the communes, it is necessary to emphasize grasping ideology, grasping production, grasping distribution, grasping life, and grasping work style. It is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, sum up experience, and solve problems. On this basis, we will set off a production upsurge that is more powerful and magnificent than last year, and ensure the completion of this year's various production plans.

During the meeting, socialist friendship competitions were launched vigorously among various special districts, counties, communes, and enterprises. Challenge letters and response letters were posted all over the venue. The meeting was full of confidence in striving for a greater Leap Forward in 1959.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 19th: The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary meeting on January 9th.

Prior to this meeting, from December 25, 1958 to January 6, 1959, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a four-level cadre meeting attended by members of the Provincial Committee, heads of provincial departments, secretaries of local (city, prefecture) and county committees, and some people's communes, factories, mines, and university party committees to discuss the implementation of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the province's 1959 national economic plan, and the issue of improving the rural financial and trade system.

The meeting earnestly discussed the issue of implementing the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. The meeting pointed out that developing production is the central link in consolidating and improving the people's communes. To carry out a large-scale high-yield movement, it is possible to concentrate efforts to select a batch of paddy fields, ditch fields, and slope fields with better conditions, and transform them into relatively concentrated and contiguous high-yield fields within a few years, and implement gardening cultivation, which is conducive to gradually building new residential points, and also conducive to gradually realizing mechanization and electrification. The meeting required all localities to conscientiously sum up their local high-yield experience, further overcome conservative ideas, comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, and vigorously carry out the large-scale high-yield movement. At present, it is first necessary to seize the field management of minor spring crops to ensure a high yield of minor spring crops, and at the same time, to prepare for spring plowing as early as possible, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1959.

The meeting pointed out that in terms of commune-run industries, factories should be actively established for fertilizers, pesticides, building materials, agricultural product processing, etc., in accordance with the principle of using local materials, small investment, and quick results. Communes with conditions should also establish industries such as sugar making, textile, paper making, mining, coal mining, metallurgy, electricity, and chemical industries, and gradually increase the proportion of industrial output value in the total output value of the commune. At present, it is necessary to first seize the establishment of county-level machinery factories, actively manufacture simple machinery and equipment, and strive to gradually realize semi-mechanization in agricultural product processing, transportation, water conservancy, cultivation, and infrastructure construction this year. This is of urgent significance for the further development of the commune's industry and agriculture. The meeting also emphasized that communes must develop commodity production as extensively as possible, and actively develop diversified operations such as cotton, oilseeds, hemp, silk, bamboo and wood products, livestock products, aquatic products, vegetables, and medicinal materials according to different characteristics.

The meeting believes that after the communization of the people, the task of the Party is to comprehensively grasp ideology, grasp production, and grasp life, and achieve victory in these three aspects at the same time. The meeting required all Party members to care for the lives of the masses as much as they care for the production of the masses. Party committees at all levels must become leaders of the production of the masses, and also become leaders of the lives of the masses.

The meeting made specific provisions on the system, organization, and production, distribution, and life of the commune, and especially emphasized that the production responsibility system must be established and improved within a time limit. All production and construction tasks of the commune must implement a "layered contracting" responsibility system and a "professional team" system for various specialized production and specialized undertakings, so as to ensure that "each level has a division of labor, everything is managed by someone, and everyone is responsible."

The meeting believes that the work of consolidating the commune must be carried out in a step-by-step manner. It is necessary to grasp the key points according to the different situations of each commune, and start by solving the urgent problems that need to be solved within the commune. In the process of consolidating the commune, it is necessary to conduct socialist and communist ideological education to the members, and closely combine it with various productions. It is also necessary to combine with the rectification of the Party organization, and in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, absorb outstanding elements who have been tested and meet the standards of Party members into the Party.

Based on the experience of developing the national economy in 1958, the meeting discussed the province's 1959 national economic plan. The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies in the people's communes, and to ensure the realization of this year's national economic plan, it is necessary to continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, further promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, continue to adhere to political command, adhere to the mass line of combining leadership with the masses, vigorously carry out mass movements, and implement the policy of walking on two legs. It is also necessary to further strengthen the overall perspective, resolutely obey the requirements of the unified national plan, pay attention to solving the problems of balance and collaboration in various aspects, so that various tasks can achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive Leap Forward in 1959.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a four-level cadre meeting to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and called on the people of all ethnic groups in the province to continue to exert their energy and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive Leap Forward this year.

The meeting formulated the 1959 Leap Forward plan. According to this plan, the increase in the magnitude and absolute output of steel, iron, copper, and grain in the province this year have increased compared with last year. The realization of this Leap Forward plan will further profoundly change the face of Yunnan Province.

In order to guarantee the realization of a greater, better and more comprehensive Leap Forward this year, the meeting considered it necessary to mobilize the broad masses of cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the province to continue to summon up soaring enthusiasm, oppose conservatism, break down superstitions, and emancipate their minds. This is a decisive factor for the Leap Forward. Specific measures must be practical, and "ten-point targets, twelve-point measures" should be promoted, as should pragmatism, while opposing exaggeration. The emancipation of minds must be combined with pragmatism, the breaking down of superstitions must be combined with respect for science, and the two must be unified in practice. The meeting also stressed that only by strengthening the Party's leadership and putting politics in command can we better carry forward the tradition of the mass line and ensure the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses. We must combine organization, discipline, unity, and the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses.

The four-level cadre meeting called on the people of all ethnic groups in the province to seize the consolidation work of the people's communes, do a good job in winter production, seize the leadership of industry, and do their best to continue the hard work and strive for a greater victory than last year.

This meeting ended on January 8 this year and was attended by members of the Provincial Party Committee, the first secretaries of the prefectural (city) and county committees, and the party secretaries of some people's communes.

    促成1950年更大更好更全面的跃进
    各省、市召开会议讨论贯彻六中全会决议
    上海
    据新华社上海19日电中共上海市第二届代表大会从去年12月28日到今年1月16日举行。这次大会的主要任务是：传达和讨论党的八届六中全会的决议；总结1958年上海工农商学兵各个战线大跃进的基本经验；研究和确定上海市1959年社会主义建设的任务；选举党的第二届市委员会。
    大会讨论了1959年上海经济建设所面临的情况和任务，初步确定了1959年上海市国民经济发展的计划。根据这个计划，上海今年工农业产值和各项主要产品都将比1958年有更大的增长。其中钢材、电机、船舶、水泥、棉纱、粮食、棉花、蔬菜等重要产品的增长数字，都超过上年度的增长数字。这个振奋人心的跃进计划的实现，将进一步改变上海的经济面貌。
    大会认为：根据全国的统一计划，上海的工业生产应该在妥善地全面安排生产、保证人民日益增长的需要的条件下，进一步向高级、精密、大型的方向发展。上海现有的工业生产应当相应地进行改组和调整，并建设必要的新企业。上海郊区的农业应该根据中央所确定的方针，进一步提高粮食、棉花、蔬菜的亩产量，并积极发展多种经营。
    大会特别强调指出：在积极发展生产问题上，不断地提高劳动生产率是一个最重要的环节。只有不断地提高劳动生产率，才能迅速地发展生产，使社会产品丰富起来，使人民生活的逐步改善有了可靠的物质基础。大会分析了上海工农业生产中劳动生产率的现状，认为这方面还蕴藏着巨大的潜力。大会要求各级党组织和工农业战线上的全体同志，积极地提高工农业生产过程的机械化、自动化程度，逐步实现工厂企业的设备更新和农业机械化、电气化；同时，继续开展广泛的群众性的技术革命，改革工具，改进产品设计和工艺，提高生产效能，不断地改进生产的组织，提高产品质量，加强原材料的节约和生产的管理工作，进一步合理地更有效地使用劳动力。
    大会认为：为了实现1959年的大跃进，必须继续贯彻党的总路线，坚持两条腿走路的方针，调动一切可以调动的力量为发展社会主义经济服务，团结一切可以团结的力量为建设社会主义服务。
    大会特别强调指出，在全国大跃进中，必须树立坚强的全局观点。全国是一盘棋，上海是全国统一计划下的一个局部。全局的利益是全党和全国人民的根本利益，完成国家计划是上海人民的最大利益。因此，全国的集中统一和地方的机动必须正确结合起来。地方机动必须以服从国家计划作前提，它的目的也是为了更好地实现全国的统一计划。
    大会认为，一年来的实践证明：加强党的领导，实现政治挂帅，执行群众路线，是我们各项事业继续大跃进的基本保证。为此，大会在关于进一步在工业企业中执行群众路线的若干问题的决议中指出：必须把大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的整风方法经常地运用起来；坚持领导干部以一部分时间参加体力劳动的制度；提倡和发扬领导干部深入现场、深入群众的作风，以便熟悉群众、熟悉生产，使领导工作更加具体，更加切实。决议要求所有领导干部应当更加关心群众生活，不仅要从物质生活上关心群众，而且要从政治思想上、学习上、技术上全面地关心群众，帮助职工不断提高政治思想水平和文化技术水平。决议要求所有干部不断提高自己的政治、思想和工作水平。要求所有干部特别是领导干部，认真学习马克思列宁主义，认真学习毛泽东著作，在目前，特别要注意学习政治经济学和唯物论辩证法。同时，要随时总结工作经验，经常运用批评和自我批评的武器，及时发现和改正思想和工作的缺点和错误。
    大会号召上海市全党和全民团结一致，在党的统一领导下，继续鼓足干劲，奋发努力，破除迷信，解放思想，在1958年胜利的基础上，跃进再跃进，为争取完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    大会最后选举出柯庆施、陈丕显、曹荻秋、魏文伯、马天水等四十五位同志为中共上海市第二届市委员会委员，选出了候补委员二十一人。参加这次大会的代表共四百九十八人，候补代表五十人。各部门负责干部也列席了大会。
    江西
    据新华社南昌19日电中国共产党江西省第五届代表大会第三次会议去年12月30日到今年1月13日在南昌举行。
    参加会议的代表们认真学习了党的八届六中全会的各项决议和毛主席的指示，一致表示完全拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    会议在总结1958年伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，提出了1959年江西省国民经济实现更大跃进的计划。会议号召全省各级党组织、全体党员、全体干部和全省人民，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成和超额完成1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗。
    会议指出，遵照党的八届六中全会决议精神，密切结合生产，大力做好整顿、巩固和提高人民公社的工作，是当前一项迫切的政治任务。各级党的组织必须在全省广大人民群众中广泛深入地进行宣传教育，从而进一步提高广大人民群众的共产主义觉悟，更为英勇和更为踏实地进行各项社会主义建设事业。必须广泛深入地宣传和贯彻人民公社发展生产的方针，即根据国家统一计划和因地制宜的原则，根据勤俭办社的原则，实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，以促进国民经济的迅速发展和人民生活的不断提高。还必须广泛深入地宣传和贯彻人民公社工资制和供给制相结合的分配原则，组织有节奏的生产，办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院等集体福利事业。
    会议指出，目前全省范围内正密切结合生产，展开了热火朝天的整社工作。在整社工作中，必须强调抓思想、抓生产、抓分配、抓生活、抓作风。要加强党的领导，放手发动群众，充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，总结经验，解决问题，在这个基础上掀起比去年更加声势浩大、规模壮阔的生产高潮，保证完成今年的各项生产计划。
    会议期间，各专区之间、各县之间、各公社之间、各企业之间，开展了轰轰烈烈的社会主义友谊竞赛。挑战书、应战书贴满了会场。会议充满了对争取1959年更大跃进的信心。
    四川
    据新华社成都19日电中共四川省委于1月9日举行了全体会议。
    在这次会议以前，中共四川省委于1958年12月25日到1959年1月6日召开了有省委委员、省级各部负责人和各地（市、州）、县委以及部分人民公社、厂矿、大专院校党委书记等参加的四级干部会议，讨论贯彻党的八届六中全会决议、全省1959年国民经济计划和改进农村财政贸易体制的问题。
    会议认真讨论了关于贯彻执行八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的问题。会议指出，发展生产是巩固和提高人民公社的中心环节。要开展大面积高产运动，可以集中力量选择一批条件较好的坝田、沟田、坡地，在若干年内改造成较为集中联片的丰产田地，实行耕作园田化，既利于逐步兴建新的居民点，又利于逐步实现机械化、电气化。会议要求各地认真总结当地的高产经验，进一步克服保守思想，全面地贯彻执行农业增产的“八字宪法”，大力开展大面积高产运动。目前首先要抓紧小春田间管理，保证小春高产，同时要及早进行春耕准备，争取1959年的大丰收。
    会议指出，在社办工业方面，应该本着就地取材、投资小、收效大的原则，积极兴办肥料、农药、建筑材料、农产品加工等工厂，有条件的社还应当兴办制糖、纺织、造纸、采矿、采煤、冶金、电力、化工等工业，逐步增加公社总产值中工业产值的比重。目前应该首先抓紧办好县的机械工厂，积极制造简易机械设备，争取今年内在农产品加工、运输、水利、耕作、基建等五方面逐步实现半机械化。这对公社工农业进一步发展有着迫切的意义。会议还强调公社必须尽可能广泛地发展商品性生产，根据不同的特点，积极发展棉花、油料、麻、蚕丝、竹木产品、畜产品、水产品、蔬菜和药材等多种经营。
    会议认为，人民公社化以后，党的任务就是全面地抓思想、抓生产、抓生活，在这三方面同时取得胜利。会议要求全体党员要像关心群众的生产那样关心群众的生活。各级党委既要成为群众生产的领导者，又要成为群众生活的领导者。
    会议对公社的体制、机构以及生产、分配、生活等方面的制度都作出了具体的规定，并特别强调要限期把生产责任制建立和健全起来，公社的一切生产建设任务，都必须实行“分层包干”的责任制以及各种专业生产和专门事业的“专业队”等制度，保证作到“层层有分工、事事有人管、个个负责任”。
    会议认为，整社工作必须有步骤地进行，要根据各个社的不同情况，抓住重点，先着手解决社内急迫需要解决的问题。在整社过程中必须向社员进行社会主义和共产主义思想教育，并且和各项生产密切结合。还要结合整顿党的组织，按照党章的规定，吸收经过考验，符合党员标准的优秀分子入党。
    会议根据1958年发展国民经济的经验，讨论了全省1959年的国民经济计划。会议指出，为了保证在人民公社中正确执行党的路线和政策，并且保证今年国民经济计划的实现，必须继续反对保守，破除迷信，进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，必须继续坚持政治挂帅，坚持领导与群众相结合的群众路线，大搞群众运动，贯彻两条腿走路的方针。还必须进一步加强全局观点，坚决服从国家统一计划的要求，注意解决各方面的平衡协作问题，使各项工作在1959年能实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
    云南
    据新华社讯　中共云南省委最近召开四级干部会议，总结1958年大跃进的经验，号召全省各族人民继续鼓足干劲，力争今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    会议制订了1959年跃进计划。按照这个计划，全省今年钢、铁、铜及粮食增产的幅度和绝对产量都比去年有了增加。这个跃进计划的实现，将使云南省的面貌进一步发生深刻的变化。
    为了保证实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，会议认为必须动员全省广大干部和各族人民继续鼓足冲天的干劲，反对保守，破除迷信，解放思想，这是跃进的决定性因素。在具体措施上必须踏实，提倡“十分指标，十二分措施”，提倡实事求是，反对浮夸。解放思想必须和实事求是相结合，破除迷信必须和尊重科学相结合，并在实践中把两者统一起来。会议还强调指出，只有加强党的领导和政治挂帅，才能更好地发扬群众路线的传统，才能保证群众干劲的充分发挥，必须把组织性、纪律性、统一性和群众的创造性、积极性结合起来。
    四级干部会议号召全省各族人民，目前就抓紧人民公社的巩固工作，搞好冬季生产，抓紧领导工业，尽最大的努力继续苦战，争取比去年更伟大的胜利。
    这次会议是在今年1月8日结束的，出席的有省委委员、地（市）、县委第一书记和部分人民公社的党委书记。
