Xinhua News Agency, 9th, Havana: The organ of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party), "Hoy," resumed publication in Havana on the 9th. In its first-page editorial, "Hoy" severely condemned the dictatorial government that had suppressed progressive activities in the past and called for the overthrow of the agencies and military intelligence organs that suppressed Communist activities.

It is reported that "Hoy" was unreasonably closed down in 1952 by the Cuban dictator Batista. After the collapse of the Batista dictatorship on the 1st, the Cuban Communists immediately took over the "Hoy" building and began the work of resuming publication of the newspaper.
