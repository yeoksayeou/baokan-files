    On Hundred Li Honghu Lake, Ten Thousand People Busily Catch Fish

    Honghu County, Hubei Province, known as the "land of fish and rice," after achieving a bumper harvest of rice in 1958, has launched a vigorous winter fishing upsurge.

    Last year, while organizing the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, Honghu County mobilized the masses to carry out a large-scale aquaculture campaign. The county's aquaculture area surged to 1.1 million mu, with 500 million fish fry released, basically eliminating all empty lakes and ponds.

    Since the beginning of winter, in order to further develop non-staple food production, the County Party Committee issued the call for "men and women to go to the lake and vigorously engage in fishing." All People's Communes, closely integrated with river network construction projects and winter manure accumulation, organized more than 11,000 male and female fishermen and more than 5,000 fishing boats to launch a fishing battle on the lakes and ponds. Braving the severe cold, the fishermen were engaged in intense labor on the hundred-li Honghu and Datong Lakes. In the Chaxi River Estuary People's Commune, the Datong Brigade's 130-plus fishermen caught 500,000 jin of mature fish in a single day. By the end of last year, the county's fresh fish production had reached 105 million jin, nearly tripling the production in 1957.

    百里洪湖上  万人捕鱼忙
    向以“鱼米之乡”著称的湖北省洪湖县，在1958年获得水稻大丰收之后，又掀起了轰轰烈烈的冬季捕鱼高潮。
    去年，洪湖县在组织工农业生产大跃进的同时，就发动群众开展了大规模的养殖运动，全县养殖水面猛增到一百一十万亩，投放鱼苗五亿尾，基本上消灭了空白湖、塘。
    入冬以来，县委为了进一步发展副食品生产，提出了“男女下湖，大搞捕鱼”的号召后，各人民公社紧密结合兴修河网工程、冬季积肥，组织了一万一千多名男女渔民，五千多只渔船，向湖、塘开展了一场捕鱼激战。渔民们冒着严寒，在那百里方圆的洪湖、大同湖的水面上，进行着紧张的劳动。汊河口公社大同大队的一百三十多名渔民，一天捕捞成鱼达五十万斤。到去年年底，全县的鲜鱼产量已达一亿零五百万斤，比1957年增产近三倍。
