    First Big, Then Small
    The Harbin Boiler Factory first ensures the completion of important products needed by the state, and then manufactures equipment to arm itself. This approach is of great value for reference to those machinery factories that are actively arming themselves.
    Completing state tasks and arming oneself are inherently consistent. Arming oneself is precisely for the purpose of completing state tasks more and better. However, while these two have a consistent side, they also have a contradictory side. Because the factory's production capacity and raw materials are ultimately limited, there must be a priority and a weighting in terms of time arrangement and the use of resources between completing state tasks first and arming oneself first. Machinery is a means of production, used for expanding reproduction. Completing state tasks on schedule allows the state to quickly produce what is most needed for the whole country. Arming oneself first can certainly contribute more to the country in the next step, but it may delay the country's urgent needs. Moreover, arming oneself is a long-term matter, and as state tasks continuously increase, enterprises will have a continuous need to increase equipment. It is impossible to achieve complete armoring all at once.
    However, having said that, some equipment used to arm oneself is precisely what is urgently needed to complete current state tasks. The task of manufacturing this type of equipment should then be placed in an important position, and due consideration should be given to the use of resources.
    In short, how to arrange the relationship between completing state tasks and arming oneself requires the application of dialectics. However, no matter what, as long as one does not deviate from the principle of "the small situation obeying the overall situation," things will not go wrong.

    先大后小
    哈尔滨锅炉厂首先保证完成国家需要的重要产品，然后制造武装自己的设备。这种做法对那些正在积极武装自己的机械工厂，很有参考价值。
    完成国家任务和武装自己，这本来是一致的东西。武装自己，正是为了更多更好地完成国家任务。然而，这二者有一致的一面，也有矛盾的一面。因为工厂的生产能力和原材料究竟有限，先完成国家任务还是先武装自己，在时间的安排和力量的使用上，总得有先有后，有重有轻。机械是生产资料，是为了扩大再生产用的。先按期完成国家任务，国家就可以用来迅速生产对全国说来是最需要的东西。先武装自己，下一步固然可以更多的为国家出力，然而却可能耽误了国家的当务之急。而且，武装自己是长期的事，国家任务不断增加，企业就有不断增加装备的需要，要求一下子做到盔甲齐全也是不可能的。
    不过，话又说回来，有些用来武装自己的设备，正是为了完成当前国家任务所迫切需要的。制造这种设备的任务就又应当摆在重要的地位，在力量的使用上给予应有的照顾。
    总之，如何安排好完成国家任务与武装自己这两者的关系，需要运用一下辩证法才行。但是，不管怎样，只要不离“小局服从大局”这个原则，事情总不会办错。
