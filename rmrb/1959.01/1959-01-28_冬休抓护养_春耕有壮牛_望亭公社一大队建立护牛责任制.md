Winter Break Focuses on Care and Nurturing; Spring Plowing Relies on Strong Oxen
Wangting Commune's First Brigade Establishes Ox Care Responsibility System

    (By our correspondent) The First Brigade of Wangting People's Commune in Wuxian, Jiangsu, has formulated a "Five Fixes, Three Goods, and One Reward" responsibility system for the maintenance of draught cattle.

    The "Five Fixes" are: fixed time, fixed feed, fixed fatness, fixed fertilizer, and fixed breeding. That is: from now until the "Beginning of Summer" in the lunar calendar next year when the draught cattle leave the shed, the brigade will distribute 26 to 30 jin of rice straw and half a jin of green bran per head of draught cattle per day. The keepers must ensure that the draught cattle gain one to two levels of fatness; each cow must accumulate half a load of cattle manure fertilizer per day. For mating cows, safe production must be ensured, and normal growth of calves must be guaranteed. The "Three Goods" require that the cattle eat well, live well, and have good sanitation. That is, drink warm water, eat crushed feed, the cattle shed is airtight, there is no accumulated manure in the shed, the ground is covered with dry grass, and the cattle have no lice. The "One Reward" is a wage increase or other material rewards for keepers who meet the requirements of the "Five Fixes and Three Goods."

    Now, the keepers throughout the brigade have stuffed the surroundings of the cattle sheds with grass to make them airtight, and have used grass bales to form four walls inside, with "ceilings" made of grass bales on top. The ground has been cleaned and padded with dry grass. Although the severe cold outside the shed is freezing, the inside is as warm as spring. The keepers get up at night to collect cow urine in buckets and change the dry grass; they brush the cattle every day to remove lice. Every keeper is determined to let the draught cattle gain enough fat to welcome the spring plowing. (Bao Chunguang) (Attached picture)

    冬休抓护养　春耕有壮牛
    望亭公社一大队建立护牛责任制
    本报讯　江苏吴县望亭人民公社一大队， 制订了一个“五定三好一奖励”的耕牛保养责任制。
    “五定”是定时间、定料、定膘、定肥、定繁殖。即：从现在起到农历来年“立夏”耕牛出棚为止，大队按每头耕牛每天二十六至三十斤稻草、半斤青糠发给饲料，饲养员要保证让耕牛长一至两个膘；每头牛每天要积半担牛粪肥。对配种的母牛，要保证安全生产，保证子牛正常生长。“三好”是要求使牛吃好、住好、卫生条件好。即喝温水、吃碎料、牛棚不透风、棚里无积粪、地上铺干草、牛身无虱子。”一奖励就是对达到“五定三好”要求的饲养员，给予工资升级或其它物质奖励制度。
    现在，全大队饲养员已经把牛棚四周用草塞得密不透风，里面又用草包围成四堵墙，上面用草包搭成“天花板”，地上打扫干净，垫上干草，尽管棚外是滴水成冰的严寒，棚内却温暖如春。饲养员夜里起来用桶接牛尿，换干草；每天都要给牛篦刷，清除牛虱。每个饲养员都决心让耕牛长足膘水，迎接春耕。　　　（鲍春光）（附图片）
