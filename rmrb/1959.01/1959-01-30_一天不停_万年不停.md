    Ceaseless for a Day, Ceaseless for Ten Thousand Years
    Su Yi
    When the tool reform movement in agricultural production first began last year, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said something very meaningful: "This kind of technical innovation movement is like a car that has started and will never stop; it will be ceaseless for a day, ceaseless for ten thousand years." The development of the national tool reform movement in 1958 fully proved the correctness of this statement. This is the basic law of the tool reform movement. Wherever this objective law was correctly reflected and consciously applied in the work, the tool reform movement developed vigorously.

    The experience of Fuyang Special District in Anhui Province, published in this newspaper on January 21, regarding the continuous advancement of the mass tool reform movement over the past year is an example. This special district has created and modified more than 3,700 kinds of tools in the past year, and promoted the use of more than 11 million pieces, saving a total of more than 500 million workdays, which powerfully promoted the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    The history of the development of human social productive forces is a history of the reform of production tools. Production tools are constantly developing from simple to complex, from manual to machines, and from low-level to high-level, and productivity is constantly improving as a result. In the beginning, people used slash-and-burn cultivation, then wooden plows and iron plows, and now tractors and electric plows have been developed. However, in the old days, the progress of this tool reform was very slow. History bore the heavy burden of class struggle, and the reform of a tool often lasted for many years. China, which first used cattle and iron plows, saw two thousand years pass, and the peasants, who had been cruelly exploited and squeezed of their last drop of blood and sweat by feudalism, were still prostrate over their iron plows. Only after liberation, when the peasants were liberated from the shackles of small private landholdings, did they have greater interest and the possibility of starting to reform the tools they had used for thousands of years. Under the call of the Party to dare to think and dare to act, and to promote the communist spirit, the journey our peasants have crossed in tool reform in the past year is comparable to that of the past few centuries.

    Since the car has started, it will continue to move forward. But a good driver is good at grasping the direction of the car's progress and adding a force to the car, so that the wheels will turn faster. The leaders of Fuyang Special District have this characteristic. They are convinced that vigorously carrying out tool reform is the main link to improve labor productivity, the most powerful measure to develop production, and they have grasped it firmly, continuously grasping it, which has set off a magnificent mass movement. Some places regard tool reform as a temporary movement, thinking that reforming the old tools once is enough to complete the task, without continuous grasping or persistent grasping. For example, last year, the whole country vigorously developed ball bearings and achieved great results. In almost one or two months, in the countryside, "every household makes ball bearings, every family has the sound of iron hammers," and many places basically realized ball bearingization, which greatly improved labor efficiency. Under these circumstances, some places think that they have "completed the task" and have not continued to do so. After a period of time, some ball bearings are worn out, and some bearings are broken. They should be replaced with new ones, but because they have not continued to manufacture them, they cannot be replaced, so they have to return to the old way. Not only has the tool reform work not improved step by step, but even the achievements that have been obtained have not been consolidated. Fuyang Special District is not like this. After the bearingization of rotating tools in this area, in addition to continuing to consolidate and improve, they continued to grasp the reform of deep plowing plows, close planting seeders, harvesting, threshing, potato processing, water management, fertilizer accumulation, soil transportation and other tools, as well as cooking utensils. This has made the tool reform movement develop one link after another, one wave after another, playing a great role in production. This year, we must well accept the experiences and lessons of last year's tool reform movement and carry out the tool reform movement persistently.

    一天不停　万年不停
    苏宜
    当去年农业生产中的工具改革运动刚刚开始的时候，刘少奇同志曾说过这样一段意味深长的话：“这样的技术革新运动，像一部车子，已经开动了，永远不会停止；一天不停，一万年不停。”1958年全国工具改革运动的发展，充分证明了这段话的正确性。这是工具改革运动的基本规律。在工作中凡是正确地反映了和有意识地运用了这个客观规律的地方，工具改革运动都蓬蓬勃勃地开展了起来。
    1月21日本报发表的安徽省阜阳专区的群众性工具改革运动一年来持续前进的经验就是一个例证。这个专区一年来共创造和改制各种工具三千七百多种，推广使用一千一百多万件，共节省劳力达五亿多个工作日，有力地推动了工农业的大跃进。
    人类社会生产力的发展史，就是一部生产工具的改革史。生产工具不断地由简单到复杂、由手工到机器、由低级到高级的发展，生产力就随之不断地提高。当初人们用刀耕火种，以后用木犁铁犁，现在又发展到拖拉机和电犁。但是在旧时代，这种工具改革的进展是很缓慢的。历史背负了阶级斗争的重担，一种工具的改革往往要延续很长的年代。最早使用耕牛和铁犁的中国，两千年过去了，被残酷的封建剥削榨去了最后一滴血汗的农民依然俯伏在他的铁犁上面。只有到了解放以后，农民从私有的小块土地的束缚下解放了出来，才有更大的兴趣和可能着手来改革他们已使用了几千年的工具。在党的敢想敢干，发扬共产主义风格的号召下，去年一年，我国农民在工具改革中所跨过的路程，抵得上过去的几个世纪。
    车子既然开动了，就会运动下去。但是好的驾驭者善于掌握车子前进的方向，给车子加上一把劲，轮子就会更快地转动起来。阜阳专区的领导者就具有这种特色。他们认定大搞工具改革是提高劳动生产率的主要环节，是发展生产的最有力的措施，大抓特抓，连续地抓，这就掀起了规模壮阔的群众性的运动。有些地方把工具改革当成一时的运动，认为把旧工具改革一遍就已完成任务，没有连续的抓，持久的抓。譬如去年全国各地大搞滚珠轴承，成绩很大。几乎在一两个月内，农村中“户户造滚珠，家家铁锤响”，许多地方基本上实现了滚珠轴承化，大大提高了劳动效率。在这种情况下，有的地方认为已经“完成了任务”，没有继续搞下去，过了一个时期，有的滚珠磨损了，有的轴承用坏了，应该换新的，但由于没有继续制造，无法更换，只好又退回到老样子，工具改革工作不仅没有步步提高，连已经得到的成绩也没有巩固住。阜阳专区就不是这样。这个地区在运转工具轴承化以后，除继续巩固、提高外，又继续抓深耕犁、密植耧、收割、脱粒、薯类加工、治水、积肥、运土等工具以及炊事用具的改革。这就使得工具改革运动一环套一环、一浪逐一浪地开展起来，在生产中发挥了很大的作用。今年，我们要很好地接受去年工具改革运动的经验和教训，把工具改革运动持久地开展起来。
