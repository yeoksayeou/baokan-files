Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 14th: The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the Vietnam-Laos border issue.

The statement said that recently, U.S. imperialism has been stepping up its intervention in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into its market and military base, and drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. In order to realize this conspiracy, U.S. imperialism has used pro-American reactionaries to create disputes on the Vietnamese border, attempting to create tension, stir up discord between the two peoples, and take the opportunity to persecute and suppress Lao patriotic anti-American people on a large scale, further strengthening U.S. intervention in Laos. At the instigation of U.S. imperialism, these reactionaries have repeatedly engaged in illegal activities on the Vietnam-Laos border, and in December of last year, they increased their troops near Xiangli District, attempting to further invade the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement said that in order to avoid conflicts that would only benefit U.S. imperialism, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had suggested to the Kingdom of Laos that the two sides meet to peacefully resolve the disputes. However, the Government of the Kingdom of Laos has not yet responded to the suggestion of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement continued that according to foreign news, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, also announced at a meeting of the National Assembly of Laos on January 12: "...The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is concentrating its forces in the border areas, making the situation serious," and emphasized that "the border has been seriously threatened." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is necessary to sternly refute the completely untrue fallacy that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is creating tension. The fact is, as the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out in its letter to the Government of the Kingdom of Laos, the Kingdom of Laos has mobilized troops to the Vietnam-Laos border and has invaded the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has the responsibility to resolutely defend its territory and will never allow anyone to invade the Xiangli area and disrupt the peaceful life of the local people.

The statement said that Laos is Vietnam's neighbor. The policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to always hope to establish friendly relations with the Government of the Kingdom of Laos. It is certain that the Lao people also have this desire.

The statement concluded that in order to express its goodwill and strive to resolve various disputes through peaceful consultation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is always willing to hold negotiations with the Government of the Kingdom of Laos to consolidate mutual friendship and improve neighborly relations between the two countries.

    越南民主共和国政府发表声明
    愿同老挝谈判改善邻邦关系
    谴责美帝国主义挑拨两国人民友谊
    新华社河内14日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人今天就越南老挝边界问题发表声明。
    声明说，最近美帝国主义竭力加强对老挝的干涉，企图把老挝变成它们的市场和军事基地，把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团。为了实现这个阴谋，美帝国主义曾经利用亲美的反动分子，在越南边境制造纠纷，企图造成紧张局势，挑拨两国人民之间的友谊，并且趁机对老挝爱国反美人士大举迫害和镇压，进一步加强美国对老挝的干涉。在美帝国主义唆使下，这些反动分子曾经多次在越老边界进行非法活动，并且在去年12月间，在向立地区附近增强兵力，企图进一步侵犯越南民主共和国领土。
    声明说，为了避免发生只有利于美帝国主义的冲突，越南民主共和国政府曾经向老挝王国建议双方会晤，以便和平解决争端。但是，老挝王国政府直到现在还没有答复越南民主共和国政府的建议。
    声明接着说，据外国的消息，老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空1月12日又在老挝国民议会会议上宣布：“……越南民主共和国在边境地区集中兵力，使局势严重”，并强调说，“边境受到了严重的威胁”。越南民主共和国政府外交部认为，必须严加驳斥那种说是越南民主共和国制造紧张局势的、完全不符事实的谬论。事实正如越南民主共和国政府在寄给老挝王国政府的信中所指出的，老挝王国把军队调集到越老边境上，并且侵犯了越南民主共和国的领土。越南民主共和国政府负有坚决保卫自己的领土的责任，决不允许任何人侵犯向立一带地方和破坏当地人民的和平生活。
    声明说，老挝是越南的邻邦。越南民主共和国政府的政策是，始终希望同老挝王国政府建立友好的关系。可以肯定，老挝人民也具有这种愿望。
    声明最后说，为了表示自己的善意态度，为了努力争取以和平协商方式来解决各项争端，越南民主共和国政府始终愿意同老挝王国政府举行谈判，以巩固彼此之间的友谊和改善两国的邻邦关系。
