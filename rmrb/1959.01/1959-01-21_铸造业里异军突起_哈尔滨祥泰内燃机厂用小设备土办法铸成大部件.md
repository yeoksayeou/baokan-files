Rising Star in the Foundry Industry
    Harbin Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory Uses Small Equipment and Indigenous Methods to Cast Large Components
    According to a report in the Heilongjiang Daily, workers in the foundry workshop of the local state-owned Harbin Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory, displaying the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, overcame difficulties characterized by "five lacks" (lacking large sandboxes, large cranes, large pouring ladles, large cupola furnaces, and large workshops). They created the "small-scale casting of large parts" method, using small equipment and indigenous techniques to cast turbine bases weighing up to eighteen tons. This provides an excellent example for factories with weak casting capabilities to manufacture components for heavy and large machinery and equipment.
    The foundry workshop of the Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory is a workshop with simple equipment, small factory buildings, and weak technical capabilities. The entire workshop had only a two-and-a-half-ton homemade crane, a two-ton capacity cupola furnace, a pouring ladle capable of holding three tons of molten iron, a small number of small sandboxes, and a working area of only over three hundred square meters. Under these equipment conditions, according to standard designs, it could generally only cast components weighing two tons. However, last year, with the addition of a two-and-a-half-ton cupola furnace and two ten-ton pouring ladles, the workshop cast large components weighing from eight to eighteen tons. The Harbin Turbine Factory, in order to cast the base of a 50,000 kW turbine, searched all the factories in the city but could not find anyone to manufacture it. Finally, it was entrusted to the Xiangtai foundry workshop. The 50,000 kW turbine base is 5.63 meters long, 2.4 meters wide, and 0.35 meters thick, with a total weight of eighteen tons. To cast such a large component, it would require a large three-section sandbox of more than ten tons, a thirty-ton crane, two five-ton cupola furnaces, two ten-ton pouring ladles, and a working area suitable for this component. When the factory accepted this task, a "theory of conditions are everything" and conservative thinking emerged among some cadres, workers, and technicians. They said: "Without large equipment, you can't do big jobs," and "If you don't have a bent belly, don't think about eating a sickle head!" The factory's Party committee promptly convened an enlarged meeting of its members to analyze and study these ideological issues, and launched a debate among the cadres based on these thoughts. At the same time, it mobilized veteran workers and technicians in the foundry workshop to conduct a thorough airing of views, debate, and discussion on the question of whether the factory's equipment conditions could cast an eighteen-ton large component. Subsequently, the Party committee put forward topics on key issues such as equipment and technology required for casting eighteen-ton components, and launched a technical revolution movement in the workshop centered on breaking through five major barriers (no large sandboxes, no large cranes, no large pouring ladles, no large cupola furnaces, no large workshops). The workers actively used their brains and contributed ideas. After more than a week of diligent study and research, they created a new and complete set of "small-scale casting of large parts" methods in molding, insulation, melting, pouring, and sand removal. Veteran worker Wang Yanrui and quality inspector Zhu Changyu jointly studied and absorbed the advantages of "pit molding" and "core molding," creating a "multi-core block molding method" that did not require sandboxes or cranes to lift core irons, dividing the entire casting into one hundred and thirty-four core blocks, piecing them together to form a sand mold instead of a sandbox. This method not only solved the key problem of casting large components under conditions of no large sandboxes and no large cranes, but also saved the state an investment of 270,000 yuan in additional equipment.
    When casting the eighteen-ton turbine base, in order to ensure quality, it was necessary to break through the key problem of insufficient iron melting capacity due to the lack of a large cupola furnace. Workers in the workshop re-repaired a twenty-year-old two-and-a-half-ton waste cupola furnace from a pile of scrap iron, increasing the factory's iron melting capacity from two tons to four and a half tons per hour. To ensure quality and a single pouring, it was necessary to accumulate four hours of molten iron in the pouring ladle. The workers proposed using refractory bricks and coke powder to thicken the pouring ladle and other external furnace insulation methods to accumulate molten iron, so that the temperature of the molten iron remained at 1,260 degrees Celsius during pouring from 1,400 degrees Celsius when it came out of the furnace within three and a half hours. They also adopted a series of measures such as slag prevention and controlling the flow of molten iron pouring, so that the two eighteen-ton 50,000 kW turbine bases fully met the quality requirements and were delivered ahead of schedule.

    铸造业里异军突起
    哈尔滨祥泰内燃机厂用小设备土办法铸成大部件
    据黑龙江日报消息　地方国营哈尔滨祥泰内燃机厂铸造车间的职工，发扬了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，在五无（无大型砂箱、无大型吊车、无大型吊包、无大型冲天炉、无大厂房）的困难条件下，创造出“小干大铸造法”，用小设备土办法铸造出重达十八吨的汽轮机底座。这为铸造能力薄弱的工厂铸造重型、大型机器设备的部件提供了良好的榜样。
    祥泰内燃机厂铸造车间是一个设备简陋、厂房矮小、技术能力薄弱的车间。全车间仅有一台载重两吨半的土吊车，一座两吨容量的冲天炉、一个能装三吨铁水的座包，为数不多的小型砂箱和仅有的三百多平方公尺的作业面积。在这种设备条件下，按正规设计，一般只能铸造出两吨重的部件。可是，这个车间去年在增置一座二吨半冲天炉和二个十吨座包的条件下，铸造出八吨到十八吨重的大部件。哈尔滨汽轮机厂为了铸造五万瓩汽轮机底座，跑遍了全市工厂，找不到人给制造。最后委托给祥泰铸造车间。五万瓩汽轮机底座长五点六三公尺，宽二点四公尺，厚零点三五公尺，全重十八吨。要铸造这样大的部件，需要有十吨以上三节的大砂箱一个、三十吨大吊车一台、五吨冲天炉两座、十吨吊包两个以及适应这个部件的作业面积。当该厂接受这一任务时，在部分干部、工人和技术人员中间出现了一种“唯条件论”和保守思想，他们说：“没有大型设备就不能干大活”“没有弯弯肚子，别想吃镰刀头！”厂党委及时召开委员扩大会议分析和研究这些思想情况，并根据这些思想在干部中间展开了辩论。同时，发动铸造车间老工人和技术人员就该厂设备条件能否铸造出十八吨大部件问题展开了大鸣、大放、大辩论。随后，党委就铸造十八吨部件所需要的设备和技术等关键问题，提出课题，在车间展开以突破五大关（无大型砂箱、无大型吊车、无大型吊包、无大冲天炉、无大厂房）为中心内容的技术革命运动。工人们纷纷开动脑筋，献计献策。经一个多星期的苦钻、苦研，在造型、保温、熔化、浇注、落砂等方面，创造出一套新的完整的“小干大铸造法”。老工人王延瑞和质量检查员朱长雨共同研究，吸取了“地坑造型”和“泥芯造型”的优点，创造出不用砂箱，不用吊车吊芯铁的“多泥芯块造型法”，把整个铸件分成一百三十四个芯块，一块一块对起来制成砂型代替了砂箱。这种方法，不仅解决了在无大型砂箱、无大型吊车的条件下铸造大部件的关键问题，而且为国家节省增置设备投资二十七万元之多。
    在铸造十八吨汽轮机底座时，为了保证质量，必须突破无大型冲天炉熔铁能力不足的关键问题。该车间工人从废铁堆中把已有二十多年的两吨半废冲天炉重新修装，使该厂熔铁能力由每小时两吨增加到四吨半。为确保质量一次浇注，需要在座包中积四小时铁水。工人们提出用耐火砖，焦炭粉加厚座包等炉外保温方法积蓄铁水，使铁水温度在三个半小时内由出炉一千四百度保持浇注时一千二百六十度，并采取了防渣、控制铁水浇注流量等一系列办法，使两台十八吨五万瓩汽轮机底座完全合乎质量，并且做到了提前交货。
