    The Agricultural Advanced Units Representatives Conference
    Puts Forward This Year's Agricultural Combat Program
    Ten Initiatives
    Xinhua News Agency, January 1st Dispatch: The National Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representatives Conference proposed ten initiatives for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. The full text is as follows:
    In 1958, China achieved great accomplishments on the agricultural front. However, the task of building a highly developed, modernized socialist agriculture is still long-term, complex, and arduous. We must continue to work hard to increase the yield of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and other various agricultural crops; we must gradually realize intensive cultivation and high yields with less planting throughout the country, gradually reduce cultivated land area, gradually reduce the labor force used in agriculture, and realize the great ideal of turning the land into gardens; we must vigorously accelerate the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front; we must also greatly develop community-run industries to realize the industrialization of the communes and the mechanization and electrification of agricultural production processes. Only after achieving these goals will the face of China's rural areas be completely changed, and the lives of farmers of all nationalities across the country will be truly prosperous.
    1959 is a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle and the tenth anniversary of our National Day. We must achieve even greater victories than in 1958 on the agricultural production front and on all fronts of rural socialist construction, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. To this end, the National Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representatives Conference, based on the Resolution on Certain Issues Concerning People's Communes of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Proposals on Agricultural Production Increase Targets for 1959, proposes the following ten initiatives to rural people's communes and all peasant brothers and sisters across the country:
    (1) Guarantee the completion of the 1959 grain production target of 1,050 billion jin, and strive to exceed it. In general areas, strive to ensure an average of 2,000 jin of grain per capita for urban and rural populations. In some places, more than 2,000 jin may be required based on needs. In areas with difficult conditions, this standard can be achieved in 1959 and 1960.
    (2) Guarantee the completion of the 1959 raw cotton production target of 100 million dan, and strive to exceed it.
    Ensure that the production of oil-bearing crops and hemp crops will have greater development in 1959. Try every means to ensure that the oil-bearing crops produced in 1959, except for those not used for oil extraction, can produce twice as much edible vegetable oil as in 1958, at least reaching 6 million tons (i.e., 12 billion jin). The output of kenaf and ramie should reach 20 million dan.
    Sugar crops, tobacco leaves, silk, tea, other various industrial raw material crops, and subtropical crops must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the production increase targets stipulated by the state.
    (3) Conscientiously do a good job in the field management of wheat, rapeseed, and other overwintering crops, apply topdressing fertilizer, irrigate frequently, and eliminate third-class seedlings. Launch winter water conservancy, soil and water conservation, deep plowing to improve the soil, and winter manure accumulation campaigns. Vigorously develop winter sideline production to increase the cash income of the commune. Ensure the safe wintering of livestock. Do all preparatory work for early rice and other spring-sown crops. Striving for a bumper harvest of summer-harvested crops and early rice is the first battle to achieve a greater bumper harvest in 1959, which must be grasped tightly and guaranteed to win.
    (4) Conscientiously implement the "soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management" eight-character charter. Implement garden-style cultivation, universally increase yield per unit area, and launch a large-scale high-yield field movement. This is the key to achieving a greater bumper harvest in 1959. Each people's commune should cultivate high-yield fields, and the area should account for about 20% of the sown area, and the yield per mu should be more than twice the average yield per mu.
    (5) Comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. While increasing the production of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and other various industrial raw material crops, comprehensively arrange the labor force to develop forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and sideline production. It is required that the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1959 increase by about one time compared with 1958.
    In terms of animal husbandry, every people's commune should conscientiously carry out the movement to ensure livestock are plump and fully pregnant. The net increase rate of large livestock in 1959 is required to reach about 10%. For pigs and sheep, it is necessary to ensure a certain net increase rate and ensure a certain market supply volume. Pigs must be fattened, ensuring that the slaughtered fat pigs weigh no less than 150 jin per head, and then the number of slaughtered heads will be converted according to this standard. For the production of chickens, ducks, eggs, aquatic products, and vegetables, each people's commune should make unified arrangements according to the conditions, taking into account the needs of commune members and urban people for non-staple foods, and regard supplying non-staple foods to cities as their glorious task.
    (6) Implement simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. People's communes and county joint cooperatives should, according to different conditions, extract a certain labor force to vigorously run industries. The industrial output value of people's communes and county joint cooperatives in 1959 should increase at least twice as much as in 1958.
    (7) Implement simultaneous development of self-sufficient production and commodity production. People's communes should develop commodity production, and the output value of commodities in 1959 should increase by about one time compared with 1958. People's communes should manage the decentralized rural commercial institutions and banks well, do a good job in the purchase of rural products and the sales of industrial products, and develop rural commerce.
    People's communes should actively establish rural transportation networks, build roads and bridges, dredge rivers, develop transportation by vehicles and ships, facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and accelerate the development of the socialist economy.
    (8) Improve the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production. The public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and homes for the elderly and other welfare undertakings of the people's communes must be run well. Guarantee the implementation of the regulations for eight hours of sleep and four hours of eating and rest, as well as the special regulations for the protection of women, pregnant women, lying-in women, and breastfeeding mothers. Make the commune members eat well, sleep well, take good care of their children, and feel comfortable, and they will have greater enthusiasm, and the realization of a greater leap forward in 1959 will be even more guaranteed.
    (9) Strive for a greater leap forward in science, culture, education, health, and sports. Continue to carry out the literacy campaign. Develop community-run primary schools and let school-age children go to school. Consolidate and improve agricultural middle schools. Run Red and Expert schools well. On the basis of combining scientific research with mass production, further carry out scientific research work in rural areas. According to the needs and wishes of commune members, carry out mass cultural and artistic activities such as drama and dance. Continue to vigorously carry out the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests and sports activities to promote people's health.
    (10) Seize the time in the recent months, closely integrate with winter production, and rectify and consolidate people's communes. Conscientiously study the Central Committee's Resolution on Certain Issues Concerning People's Communes, unify understanding, improve ideology, do a good job in production, do a good job in life, do a good job in the operation and management of people's communes, establish responsibility systems, implement economic accounting, practice strict economy, and oppose extravagance and waste; and it is necessary to closely rely on the leadership of the Party, implement political command, promote democratic style and the style of seeking truth from facts, and make the people's communes better and better.
    Comrades! Let us unite under the leadership of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, work together, implement these ten initiatives, continue to exert our utmost efforts, oppose conservative thinking, implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 on the agricultural production front and on all fronts of rural socialist construction! Strive to support national industrialization and accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country!

    农业先进单位代表会议
    提出今年农业战斗纲领
    十大倡议
    新华社1日讯　全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议为在1959年实现更大更好更全面的跃进提出的十大倡议。全文如下：
    1958年我国在农业战线上取得了伟大的成就。但是，建设高度发展的、现代化的社会主义农业的任务，还是长期的、复杂的、艰巨的。我们要继续努力增加粮食、棉花、油料和其他各种农作物的产量；要逐步在全国范围内实现精耕细作、少种多收，逐步减少耕地面积，逐步减少使用在农业方面的劳动力，实现大地园林化的伟大理想；要大力加速林业、牧业、副业和渔业的发展，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌；还要大大发展社办工业，实现公社工业化和农业生产过程的机械化电气化。只有在达到这些目的以后，我国农村面貌才会彻底改变，全国各民族农民的生活才会真正富裕。
    1959年是苦战三年中有决定性的一年，又是我国国庆十周年。我们必须在农业生产战线上和农村社会主义建设的各个战线上，取得比1958年更大的胜利，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。为此，全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议，根据中国共产党八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议和关于1959年农业增产指标的建议，向全国各地农村人民公社和全体农民兄弟姊妹，提出如下的十大倡议：
    （一）保证完成1959年粮食产量一万零五百亿斤的任务，并且力争超过。一般地区，力求做到按城乡人口平均每人有粮食两千斤。有些地方，根据需要可以多于两千斤。条件困难的地方，可以在1959和1960两年内达到这个标准。
    （二）保证完成1959年生产一亿担皮棉的任务，并且力争超过。
    保证油料作物的生产和麻类的生产在1959年都有更大的发展。想尽一切办法，使1959年所生产的油料作物，除了不用于榨油的以外，能够生产的食用植物油比1958年增加一倍，至少达到六百万吨（即一百二十亿斤）。黄洋麻和苎麻的产量达到二千万担。
    糖料、烟叶、丝、茶、其他各种工业原料作物和亚热带作物，都要保证完成和超额完成国家所规定的增产指标。
    （三）切实做好小麦、油菜和其他过冬作物的田间管理，施追肥，勤浇水，消灭三类苗。开展冬修水利、水土保持、深翻改良土壤和冬季积肥运动。大搞冬季副业生产，增加公社的现金收入。保证牲畜安全过冬。做好早稻和其他春播作物的一切备耕工作。争取夏收作物和早稻的大丰收，是实现1959年更大丰收的第一仗，必须抓紧，保证胜利。
    （四）认真执行“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八字宪法。实行耕作园田化，普遍提高单位面积产量，开展大面积高产田运动。这是实现1959年更大丰收的关键。各个人民公社都要培植高产田，面积应该占播种面积的20％左右，亩产量应该比平均亩产量高一倍以上。
    （五）农林牧副渔全面发展。在增产粮食、棉花、油料和其他各种工业原料作物的同时，要全面安排劳动力，发展林业、牧业、渔业和副业生产。要求1959年林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的产值比1958年增加一倍左右。
    在畜牧业方面，每一个人民公社都要认真开展满膘、满怀运动。大家畜1959年的净增率要求达到10％左右。猪、羊既要保证一定的净增率，又要保证一定的上市量，猪要喂肥，保证杀的肥猪，每头毛重不少于一百五十斤，以后就按这个标准，来折算屠宰的头数。鸡鸭、蛋品、水产和蔬菜等生产，每一个人民公社都要根据条件统一安排，要兼顾公社社员和城市人民副食品的需要，并且把供应城市副食品当做自己的光荣任务。
    （六）实行工业和农业同时并举。人民公社和县联社都要根据不同的条件，抽出一定的劳动力来大办工业。人民公社和县联社1959年的工业产值至少要比1958年增加一倍。
    （七）实行自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举。人民公社要发展商品生产，商品的产值1959年要比1958年增加一倍左右。人民公社要把下放的农村商业机构和银行管理好，做好农村产品的收购工作和工业产品的销售工作，发展农村商业。
    人民公社要积极建立农村交通运输网，修路架桥，疏浚河道，发展车运船运，便利城乡物资交流，加速社会主义经济的发展。
    （八）在发展生产的基础上，改善群众生活。人民公社的公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园和敬老院等生活福利事业，必须办好。保证实行睡觉八小时和吃饭休息四小时的规定，以及关于保护妇女、孕妇、产妇和哺乳的母亲的特殊规定。使社员吃好饭，睡好觉，带好孩子，心情舒畅，干劲更大，实现1959年更大的跃进也就更有保证。
    （九）争取科学、文化、教育、卫生和体育事业更大的跃进。继续开展扫盲运动。发展社办小学，让学龄儿童都入学读书。巩固提高农业中学。办好红专学校。在科学研究和群众生产相结合的基础上，进一步开展农村中的科学研究工作。按照公社社员的需要和自愿，开展群众性的戏剧、歌舞等等文化艺术活动。继续大力进行以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动和体育活动，增进人民的健康。
    （十）抓紧最近几个月的时间，密切结合冬季生产，整顿巩固人民公社。认真学习中央关于人民公社若干问题的决议，统一认识，提高思想，搞好生产，搞好生活，搞好人民公社的经营管理，建立责任制度，实行经济核算，厉行节约，反对铺张浪费；并且一定要紧密依靠党的领导，实行政治挂帅，发扬民主作风和实事求是的作风，使人民公社愈办愈好。
    同志们！让我们大家团结在中共中央和毛主席的领导下，共同努力，实行这十大倡议，继续鼓足干劲，反对保守思想，贯彻执行多快好省建设社会主义的总路线，为在1959年在农业生产战线上和农村社会主义建设的各个战线上，取得比1958年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗！为支援国家工业化、加快我国社会主义建设的速度而奋斗！
