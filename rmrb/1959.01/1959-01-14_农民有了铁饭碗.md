According to the Hebei Daily, the sixth management district of the Chengguan People's Commune in Ningjin County, during the rectification of the commune, mobilized the masses to summarize the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the commune, further enhancing confidence in running the commune well.

At the beginning of the rectification, in forums and airing of views, the vast majority of party members, cadres, and peasants had a correct understanding of the commune. However, people's understanding of the benefits of the commune was not entirely consistent. The General Branch Committee of the management district decided to further mobilize the masses, present facts, reason things out, and calculate meticulously, summarizing the commune's superiority as mainly manifested in the following aspects:

First, due to the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of the people's commune, the grain yield per mu in this management district increased from 360 jin in 1957 to 698 jin, and the cotton yield per mu increased by 23%. Income from agriculture, forestry, and sideline industries totaled more than 1.14 million yuan, double that of 1957. After deductions, an average of 70 yuan was distributed per person, more than 20 yuan more than in 1957. 93% of the commune members increased their income, and the remaining 6.5% of the commune members' income was roughly the same as in 1957. Second, the commune implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, and the peasants obtained an iron rice bowl. Poor peasant commune member Zhang Shousong said: "Eating in the commune doesn't cost money, and we also get wages. Small cooperatives (i.e., advanced cooperatives) cannot do that." Third, it was unanimously agreed that small cooperatives could only achieve small leaps forward, while communes could achieve great leaps forward. As soon as the commune was established, it bought three tractors. Could that small cooperative have afforded that in the past? In just over 100 days since the commune was established, it has built 19 factories, including steel plants, machinery plants, and brick and tile factories, employing more than 1,700 workers, investing 230,000 yuan, and the output value has reached more than 9.9 million yuan. It has manufactured heavy industrial products such as gas engines, generators, and water pumps, as well as paper, cigarettes, and wine. This was impossible for advanced cooperatives in the past. Fourth, women pointed out that because canteens, kindergartens, and sewing factories were established, women were freed from the "three stoves" and could work in the fields, be workers, and study like men. In this management district alone, more than 800 female laborers were liberated.

In order to raise awareness, unify understanding, the movement of seven investigations and seven examinations was widely launched from within the party to outside the party: investigate the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and see the existing problems; investigate the superiority of the commune, and see the shortcomings; investigate production and life, and see the tasks to be completed currently; investigate the leadership style of cadres, and see the reflections of the masses; investigate ideology, and see work, drive, and care for public property; investigate finances, and see waste; investigate labor allocation, and see wasted work. Through this movement, the vast number of commune members further established the idea of achieving a greater leap forward in 1959.

In the airing of views and debates, the vast number of cadres humbly listened to the criticisms and opinions of the commune members. For the opinions put forward by the commune members on production, life, and labor allocation, most of them were improved. Cadres visited commune members door to door and solicited opinions on all aspects. According to the opinions of the commune members, the ten canteens that originally lacked dining halls were solved by mobilizing commune members to borrow houses; each canteen also set up small stoves in the spirit of large collective and small freedom, and commune members could freely buy various delicious stir-fried dishes. Appropriate care systems were formulated for the elderly, children, the sick, and postpartum women. The labor organization was reorganized, and strong laborers were transferred to the front line, and male and female weak laborers were put into weaving mats, finishing the threshing ground, and other productions. The vast number of commune members praised: "If we do it this way, the commune will definitely be run better."

    农民有了铁饭碗
    据河北日报消息　宁津县城关公社第六管理区，在整社工作中，发动群众总结大跃进成绩和公社优越性，进一步增强了办好公社的信心。
    整社开始，在座谈和鸣放中，绝大部分党员、干部和农民对于公社的认识是正确的，但是，公社究竟有哪些好处，人们的认识并不完全一致。管理区总支委员会决定进一步发动群众，摆事实讲道理，算细账，总结出公社的优越性主要表现在以下几方面：
    一、由于大跃进和人民公社的建立，这个管理区的粮食亩产由1957年三百六十斤提高到六百九十八斤，棉花亩产量提高了23％。农林副业共收入一百一十四万多元，比1957年增加一倍。除去扣留平均每人分到七十元，比1957年多二十多元，93％的社员增加了收入，其余6.5％的社员收入与1957年大体相等。二、公社实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，农民得到了铁饭碗。贫农社员张寿松说：“公社吃饭不要钱，还给工资，小社（即高级社）是办不到的。”三、一致认为小社只能小跃进，公社才能大跃进。公社一成立就买来三台拖拉机，过去那个小社能买起？公社成立才一百多天，就建立起钢厂、机械厂、砖瓦厂等十九个工厂，工人一千七百多个，投资二十三万元，产值已达到九百九十多万元，自己造出了煤气机、发电机、水泵等重工业产品，此外还有纸张、卷烟、酒等。这是过去高级社都办不到的。四、妇女们提出，因为办了食堂、幼儿园、缝纫厂，妇女摆脱了“三台”，和男人一样能下地、能当工人、能学习了，只这个管理区就解放出了八百多名妇女劳力。
    在提高觉悟统一认识，从党内到党外广泛地开展了七查七看运动：查大跃进成绩，看存在问题；查公社优越性，看美中不足；查生产生活，看当前应完成的任务；查干部领导作风，看群众反映；查思想，看工作、干劲和爱护公物；查财务，看浪费；查劳力支配，看窝工现象。通过这个运动，广大社员进一步树立了1959年实现更伟大跃进的思想。
    在鸣放辩论中，广大干部虚心听取了社员的批评和意见。对于社员们提出的生产、生活、劳力支配等方面的意见，多数进行了改进，干部挨门挨户访问了社员，征求了对各方面的意见。根据广大社员鸣放意见，原来缺饭厅的十个食堂，发动社员借房子解决了；各食堂并且本着大集体小自由的精神设置了小灶，社员可以随便买各种味美的炒菜。对老人、孩子、病人和产妇订出了适当照顾的制度。对劳动组织重新进行了调整，将壮劳力换到了第一线，男女弱劳力投入了织席、打场扫尾等生产，广大社员都称赞说：
  “要这样办，公社一定能办得更好”。
