Folk Songs and New Poetry
Zang Kejia

Since the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm for mass creation has surged, with folk songs numbering in the hundreds of millions, like the sea. Folk songs have enriched the garden of poetry, bringing it vigorous vitality and foretelling a bright and splendid future. This grand occasion is unprecedented, giving us tremendous encouragement and joy. At the same time, for professional poets and for new poetry, it is also a powerful stimulus and spur, prompting the resolution of some problems that existed in the past (the integration of poetry with the masses; poets immersing themselves in labor life, thoroughly transforming thoughts and feelings; the establishment of a national form of new poetry, etc.).

Some problems have begun to be resolved as poets listen to the call of the Party. Many poets have gone to fiery struggles to temper themselves, and many poets, inspired and influenced by folk songs, have begun to change their poetic style. The lives of poets and working people are gradually integrating, and new poetry and folk songs are slowly approaching each other.

This phenomenon is exciting. But that is not to say that all the existing problems have been completely resolved. Now, I feel that on the road of progress, the evaluation of folk songs and new poetry, the relationship between folk songs and new poetry, how they will be combined (especially how poets will learn from folk songs), and opinions on the form of new poetry are still under discussion, and views from all sides are not consistent.

Since the large-scale production of folk songs, according to my personal understanding, there are two opposing views on the relationship between folk songs and new poetry and their evaluation. One is that folk songs truly reflect the great socialist reality, express the working people's enthusiasm for creation and their certainty about the future, and in terms of form, they are also popular with the people, carrying forward the excellent traditions of Chinese folk songs. In contrast, new poetry is not good, it is inferior. The achievements, value, and role of new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, if not negligible, are also very poor.

The other view is completely different. They believe that folk songs are just impromptu short songs of five or seven characters per line, and are not worth mentioning. They over-evaluate new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, and relatively suppress the value and influence of folk songs.

I think both of these views are biased. We cannot put the relationship between folk songs and new poetry in an antagonistic position to discuss and resolve. The creation of the people and the creation of professional poets should complement each other (I am referring, of course, to excellent works written by poets that are rich in popular character). There are differences in the depth and breadth of reflecting real life, and in the style of artistic expression, but in the significance of reflecting reality, and in the role they play in expressing people's lives, they should basically be the same. The people of the Tang Dynasty created many beautiful and moving folk songs, and the brilliance of Du Fu and Bai Juyi's poems is not only not overshadowed by them, but also complements each other. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people created many folk songs satirizing the Kuomintang reactionaries, and professional poets also wrote mountain songs and ditties. Now, the folk songs created by the working people and the creations of poets should be unified at the basic point of serving socialism. We cannot belittle new poetry because we affirm the great achievements of folk songs, or deliberately raise new poetry and thus underestimate folk songs.

The achievements of folk songs are brilliant. The influence of folk songs is enormous. First of all, poets should learn from folk songs, learn from their simple, healthy, and fresh poetic style and the forms loved by the people, to enrich new poetry, enhance the expressive power of new poetry, establish a national form of new poetry, and make new poetry gradually integrate with the broad masses. Outstanding classical poets also drew beautiful things from the source of people's creation. Today, the situation is even more different, and the significance of poets learning from folk songs is even more important.

We emphasize that poets should learn from folk songs, but fair evaluation should also be given to the fruits of poets' labor.

New poetry, before the May Fourth Movement even occurred, was born with a brand-new face, bearing the fighting mission given by the times. For more than forty years, it has served the revolutionary cause in different historical stages, under the guidance of socialist ideology, and under the leadership of the Party, becoming a sharp soldier on the literary and artistic front. In the struggles against imperialism, feudalism, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and resistance to the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek, it made achievements, and in the struggle against anti-realist poetry schools, it also played the role of a fighter. The revolutionary realist poetry tradition since the May Fourth Movement, represented by the creations of Guo Moruo, Jiang Guangci, Yin Fu...etc., should be affirmed and given a deserved evaluation based on scientific analysis. It is wrong to over-evaluate it, and it is unfair to underestimate its value.

New poetry since the May Fourth Movement has many shortcomings. In terms of content, it does not reflect the situation of real struggle sufficiently; because many authors have petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings, the form of expression is not easily accepted by the general public..., therefore, the circle of new poetry is relatively narrow, and it has not been able to penetrate the masses and play a greater role.

The existence of these shortcomings has prevented new poetry from integrating with the broad masses. There are two reasons for these shortcomings. First of all, the poets themselves should be responsible. For example, during the Left League era, some people went to the actual struggle life, like Yin Fu (he went to do revolutionary work), but not every poet did so. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "Literary Association" called on "writers to go to factories, writers to go to the countryside, writers to join the army," and some people did it, but it did not really solve the problem. In terms of form, various experiments have been done in the past (more on this below), but it has not been solved together with the problem of poets immersing themselves in life (I am talking about the situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before liberation), so it has not achieved great results.

But the entire responsibility cannot be pushed onto the poets. There were also objective difficulties. Under the white terror, poets did not have the freedom to go to the people's struggle. The people groaned in pain, and the conditions for maintaining the lowest material life were out of the question, let alone cultural life. Poetry, to expand a little, all new literary and artistic works, the opportunity for real working people to contact is very, very small, if not absolutely none. If someone is criticizing why new poetry since the May Fourth Movement cannot penetrate the masses, and at the same time doing some actual analysis work on the past, summarizing the past experiences, both successful and failed, it will be helpful for better progress.

The form of new poetry has been a problem since its birth, and poets have also made various efforts, hoping to seek and experiment with suitable forms. Some people wanted to apply certain things from classical poetry to new poetry writing, such as Mr. Yu Pingbo. Many of the words and phrases in his works are old, and the artistic conceptions represented by these words and phrases are also old. Mr. Wen Yiduo was the founder of strict metrical poetry. He mainly adopted the form of English poetry and added some elements of Chinese classical poetry. The influence formed the so-called "tofu-like shape" (referring to his works in "Dead Water." Comrade Li Yaqun said that there is a "tofu-like shape" in "free poetry," I don't know what it refers to?). The form of Liu Dabai's poems has both old poetry elements and folk song elements. Liu Bannong, on the other hand, emphasized folk songs and even used colloquial language in poetry. Others have purely Europeanized sonnets, and also "short poems" learning from Japanese haiku and Tagore's form. As for the influence of Whitman's free verse on Chinese new poetry, it is obvious.

Although new poetry has undergone various experiments in form, the form problem has not been completely resolved. The form that is truly loved by the people has not been established, and new poetry has not penetrated the working people. In 1942, after Chairman Mao spoke at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the issue of the direction of literature and art was truly and thoroughly resolved. Poets went to the struggle life, not locked in a room to experiment, solving the form problem, but solving it in connection with poets immersing themselves in the masses and transforming their thoughts and feelings. The poet Li Ji wrote "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," which opened up a new world for new poetry. It made new poetry richer because it absorbed the strengths of folk songs, and it made new poetry closer to the masses. Of course, this is not just the result of formally imitating folk songs.

The current folk songs, of course, mainly take the form of five or seven characters per line. There are more works in this form, but we cannot say that the form of folk songs is simple and cannot fully express great themes and complex realities. The form of folk songs is diverse, and at the same time, it is developing every day, changing every day, and improving every day on the basis of popularization. Longer narrative poems and lyrical poems are increasing. Drum lyrics, fast talk, etc. in folk art should also be included in the scope of poetry, so its form is not simple. We cannot regard folk songs only as five or seven characters per line, ignoring its diversification and narrowing its scope, therefore looking down on it!

Folk songs are developing. This is the case in both content and form. Most of the current folk songs, whether created by farmers, workers, or soldiers, mainly sing the praises of the labor life they are engaged in. I think this situation will also develop forward with the ever-changing real life. In the future, the boundaries between urban and rural areas will gradually disappear; the difference between manual labor and mental labor will be gradually eliminated, the world of life will be expanded, the experience will be broadened, and the themes of poetry will also expand accordingly, and the form will inevitably develop. The cultural level of the working people has improved. They can read classical poetry, new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, and also indirectly and directly read foreign poetry. With the expansion and improvement of both material and spiritual life, their creations will also increase accordingly, both in content and form.

Now, folk songs have given new poetry a great stimulus and injected new vitality into it. Conversely, folk songs are also influenced by new poetry. This situation is particularly evident in the creations of workers. Due to cultural level, workers are more likely to accept the influence of new poetry. I think that the higher the cultural level of farmers in the future, the greater the possibility of accepting the influence of new poetry.

Now, professional intellectual poets, because they have participated in labor training, their thoughts and feelings have been transformed, and they have gradually combined with the life, thoughts, and feelings of the working people. Their creations, whether in terms of content or form, are also very different from the past. They have gradually absorbed new things from folk songs and changed their poetic style. On the other hand, the creation of the working people is also developing and advancing day by day. I think that in the future, these two will converge. In terms of form, a national form loved by the people of the whole country will appear. I dare not say what this form will look like, but a little clue can be seen from some folk songs and some poets' works (recent works by Comrades He Jingzhi, Guang Weiran, etc.). Such works are built on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry. It is of course wrong to regard the form problem of poetry as a political problem like Comrade Li Yaqun. But the form problem cannot be avoided. The form problem, especially in new poetry, is very important and has not been solved after many years of discussion.

Even if a good national form is created in the future due to the convergence of new poetry and folk songs, in terms of creation, everyone can choose the form they want to use. Even if there is a basic form, letting a hundred flowers bloom is inevitable. Take free verse, for example. From the birth of new poetry, poets have used it, and it has made contributions. For example, some free verses by Comrade Guo Moruo and Comrade Tian Jian played a role in history and were welcomed by the people. At present or in the future, metrical poetry is the main form of poetry (I also include folk songs in metrical poetry), I don't think there is a problem, but if someone wants to use the form of free verse, so be it. We cannot reject or treat free verse differently because we emphasize folk songs or folk song-style new poetry. This is too narrow. Free verse has its own characteristics, it is less restrictive to use, and it has a greater effect when recited.

The above is my opinion on the relationship between folk songs and new poetry, the form problem, and the future development of these two. It is not thorough, and mistakes are inevitable, because I am participating in the discussion, I am publishing it as a personal opinion.

    民歌与新诗
    臧克家
    大跃进以来，群众创作热情澎湃，民歌数以亿计，好像大海。民歌丰富了诗歌园地，给它带来了强盛的生命力，预示了一个光辉灿烂的未来。这盛况是空前的，它给我们以极大的鼓舞和喜悦。同时呢，对于专业的诗人们，对于新诗，也是一个有力的刺激和鞭策，促使过去存在着的一些问题（诗与群众结合；诗人深入劳动生活，彻底改造思想情感；新诗的民族形式的建立，等等）趋于解决。
    有的问题，由于诗人们听从党的号召，已经开始解决了。许多诗人纷纷到火热斗争里去锻炼，许多诗人受到民歌的启发和影响，已经开始在改变自己的诗风。诗人和劳动人民的生活，渐渐地结合起来了，新诗与民歌也慢慢地接近起来了。
    这现象是令人兴奋的。但这并不是说存在的问题都已经全部解决了。现在，我觉得正在前进的途程中，对于民歌与新诗的估价，民歌与新诗的关系，它们将如何结合（特别是诗人们如何向民歌学习），以及对新诗形式的意见，都还在讨论之中，各方面的看法还不一致。
    自从民歌大量产生以后，据我个人了解，对民歌与新诗的关系和对它们的评价有两种相反的意见。一种是，认为民歌是真正反映了社会主义伟大现实，表现了劳动人民创造的热情和对于未来的确信，形式方面也是人民喜闻乐见的，发扬了中国民歌的优良传统。相形之下，新诗是不行的，逊色的。“五四”以来的新诗成绩、价值和作用，不说不足道，也是很差的。
    另一种看法迥乎不同。认为民歌只是五言四句或七言四句的即兴短歌，算不得什么。他们过高地评价了“五四”以来的新诗，在相对的意义上压低了民歌的价值和影响。
    这两种意见我觉得都偏了。我们不能把民歌和新诗的关系放在对立的地位上去谈、去解决。人民群众的创作和专业诗人的创作，应该是相辅相成的（我指的当然是诗人们写的富有人民性的优秀作品）。在反映现实生活的深度广度上，在艺术表现的风格上有所不同，但在反映现实的意义上，在表现人民生活所起的作用上，它们基本上应该是共同的。唐朝的人民创作了许多优美动人的民歌，而杜甫、白居易的诗的光芒不但不为它所掩盖而且是互相辉映。抗战时期，人民创造许多民歌讽刺国民党反动派，专业的诗人也写了山歌小调。现在劳动人民创作的民歌同诗人们的创作，在为社会主义服务的基本点上应该统一起来。不能因为肯定民歌的伟大成就就把新诗贬低，或故意抬高新诗因而小看了民歌。
    民歌的成就是光辉灿烂的。民歌的影响是巨大的。首先，诗人们应当向民歌学习，学习它那种朴素、健康、清新的诗风和为人民群众所喜爱的形式，以丰富新诗，增强新诗的表现能力，建立新诗的民族形式，使新诗一步步与广大群众相结合。杰出的古典诗人也都是从人民创作的泉源里吸取美好的东西。在今天，情况更不同，诗人们学习民歌的意义也更加重要了。
    我们强调诗人们向民歌学习，但对诗人们的劳动成果也应当给予公平的估价。
    新诗，在“五四”运动还没有发生的时候，它就以崭新的面貌，负着时代赋予的战斗任务诞生了。四十多年来，它在不同的历史阶段，在社会主义思想的指导下，在党的领导下，为革命事业服务，成为文艺战线上的一个尖兵。在反帝、反封建、抗战、反抗蒋介石反动政权的斗争中，它作出了成绩，在和反现实主义诗派作斗争中，它也起了战士的作用。“五四”以来，以郭沫若、蒋光慈、殷夫……等等的创作为代表的革命的现实主义的诗歌传统，是应该被肯定的，应当凭科学分析，给它一个应有的受之无愧的评价。评得过高了是不对的，低估了它的价值也是不公允的。
    “五四”以来的新诗，本身存在着不少缺点。在内容方面，比起现实斗争的情况来，它反映得不足；由于许多作者本身存在着小资产阶级思想情感，表现形式不容易为人民大众所接受……，因而新诗的圈子比较狭窄，没能够深入群众，起更大的作用。
    这些缺点的存在，使新诗未能与广大群众结合，造成这些缺点的原因有二。首先，诗人们自己应该负责。譬如左联时代就有人到实际斗争生活中去，像殷夫（他是为了去作革命工作的），但并不是每个诗人都如此。抗战时期，“文协”号召“作家下厂，作家下乡，作家入伍”，有些人照办了，但并未能真正解决问题。在形式方面，过去也曾作过多种试验（下面再谈），但并没有把它和诗人深入生活的问题一起解决（我说的是解放前蒋管区情况），所以也未收到大的效果。
    但也不能把整个责任，一古脑推到诗人身上。客观上也有困难。在白色恐怖下，诗人就没有到人民斗争中去的自由，人民呻吟在痛苦之中，维持最低物质生活的条件都谈不上，文化生活更不在话下了。诗歌，扩大点说，一切新文艺作品，真正劳动人民接触的机会是极少极少的，如果不说绝对没有的话。如果有人在指责“五四”以来的新诗为什么不能深入群众的同时，对彼时彼地作一些实际分析工作，总结一下过去的经验，成功的和失败的，对于更好地前进是有帮助的。
    新诗的形式，自从它诞生以后就存在着问题，诗人们也曾经作过种种努力，希图寻求、试验适合的形式。有的人想把古典诗词里的某些东西运用到新诗写作上来，俞平伯先生就是如此。他作品里的许多词藻是旧的，这些词藻代表的意境也是旧的。闻一多先生是严格格律诗的创始者，他主要采用了英国诗的形式，又加入一些中国古典诗歌的成分，影响所及，形成了所谓“豆腐干形”
  （指他“死水”里的作品。李亚群同志说“自由诗”里有“豆腐干形”，不知系何所指？）。刘大白的诗作形式，有旧诗成分也有民歌成分。刘半农呢，则强调民歌，甚至采用土语入诗。其余的，有纯粹欧化的十四行，也有学习日本俳句和泰戈尔形式的“小诗”。至于惠特曼的自由诗给中国新诗的影响，是显而易见的。
    新诗在形式方面虽然作过多种试验，但形式问题并没有得到彻底解决。真正为人民群众喜见乐闻的形式并未建立起来，新诗也没有深入到劳动人民大众中去。到了1942年，毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲了话以后，文艺的方向问题才得到真正彻底解决。诗人们到斗争生活里去了，不是关在屋子里试验，解决形式问题，而是把诗人深入群众、改造思想情感联系在一起解决。诗人李季写了“王贵与李香香”，给新诗开辟了一个新天地。它使新诗因为吸取了民歌的长处而更加丰富，它使得新诗和群众更接近了。当然，这不仅仅是形式上模仿民歌的结果。
    目前的民歌，固然以五言四句或七言四句为主要形式，这种形式的作品比较多，但决不能说民歌的形式简单，不能充分表现伟大的主题，复杂的现实。民歌的形式是多样的，同时，它天天在发展，天天在变化，天天在普及的基础上提高。较长的叙事诗和抒情诗多起来了。曲艺里的鼓词、快书等等，也应当划入诗的范围，这样，它的形式更不简单了。不能把民歌只看作五言四句或七言四句，看不到它的多样化，缩小了它的范围，因此瞧它不起！
    民歌在发展着。不论在内容和形式两方面都是如此。现在的民歌，不论是农民、工人和士兵创作的，大半以歌颂自己所从事的劳动生活为主，这情况我看也会随着一日万变的现实生活向前发展。将来，城乡的界限渐渐消失了；体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别慢慢取消了，生活的天地扩大了，见闻广阔了，诗歌的题材也一定随着扩大，形式势必也有所发展。劳动人民的文化水平提高了，他们可以读古典诗歌、“五四”以来的新诗，也可以间接、直接读外国诗歌了。随着物质和精神双方面生活的扩大与提高，他们的创作也一定相应地提高，不论在内容和形式上。
    现在，民歌给了新诗以极大的刺激，也给它注入了新的生命力。相反的，民歌也受到新诗的影响。这情况，在工人同志的创作中特别显著。由于文化水平关系，工人比较容易接受新诗的影响。我觉得，将来农民文化水平越高，接受新诗影响的可能性也就越大。
    现在专业的知识分子诗人，由于参加了劳动锻炼，思想情感得到了改造，渐渐地和劳动人民的生活、思想情感结合了起来，他们的创作，不论在内容方面或形式方面，也与前大不同了。渐渐地从民歌中吸取了新的东西，改变了自己的诗风。另一方面，劳动人民的创作，也一天一天在发展前进之中。我觉得，在将来，这两者会汇合起来。在形式方面会出现一种为全国人民所喜爱的民族形式。这种形式，是个什么样子还不敢说定，但从一些民歌和一些诗人的作品（贺敬之，光未然等同志的近作）中可以看出一点苗头。这样的作品，是在民歌和古典诗歌的基础上建立起来的。把诗歌的形式问题看作是政治性的问题如李亚群同志那样，当然是不对的。但形式问题也不能避而不谈。形式问题，特别在新诗方面，是很重要的，讨论了许多年没有得到解决。
    即使将来由于新诗和民歌的汇合，创立了一种很好的民族形式，但在创作方面，每个人可以选择自己所愿意运用的形式。即使有了一个基本形式，百花齐放还是必然的。就拿自由诗来说吧，从新诗一诞生，诗人们就利用过它，它立过功。例如郭沫若同志和田间同志的一些自由诗，在历史上起过作用，受到了人民的欢迎。目前或将来，格律诗是诗的主要形式（我把民歌也列入格律诗内），我看是没有问题的，但有人愿意用自由诗的形式也听便。我们不能因为强调民歌或民歌式的新诗就排斥或另眼看待自由诗，这未免太狭隘了。自由诗有它的特点，运用起来拘束性较小，朗诵起来效果较大。
    上面是我对民歌与新诗的关系问题，形式问题，以及这两者未来发展问题的一点意见。说得不周到，错误也难免，因为参加讨论，作为个人的意见把它发表出来。
