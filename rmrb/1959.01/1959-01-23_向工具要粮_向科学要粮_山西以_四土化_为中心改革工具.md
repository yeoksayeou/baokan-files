Seeking Grain from Tools, Seeking Grain from Science
Shanxi Reforms Tools Centered on "Four Indigenous Technologies"

Taiyuan Dispatch: Shanxi Province's rural areas are universally launching a tool reform movement centered on "Four Indigenous Technologies" (indigenous machine tools, indigenous machinery, indigenous electric motors, and indigenous railways). As of recently, the province has created and improved more than 8.6 million various tools. These newly created and reformed tools have generally increased production efficiency by more than twofold, with the highest increase reaching about sixty-sixfold.

Shanxi Province's larger-scale tool reform movement began after November of last year and was formed to meet the demands of the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. The greater leap forward in 1959 not only requires deep plowing and meticulous cultivation of the province's 26 million mu of basic farmland and 16 million mu of garden-style land, and strengthening field management, but also requires many basic construction projects, all of which require more labor. The Party organizations and agricultural leading departments at all levels in Shanxi Province timely put forward the slogans of "seeking grain from tools, seeking grain from skillful work, and seeking grain from science" last autumn, and decided to launch a mass tool reform movement that is more extensive and in-depth throughout the province, expanding the scope of tool reform from water conservancy construction sites to include agricultural production, basic construction, power machinery, transportation, and daily life. Because all localities have focused on the production of tools for creating tools – "Four Indigenous Technologies" – the province's tool reform movement has been rapidly developed.

The tool reform movement centered on "Four Indigenous Technologies" in Shanxi Province has recently been closely integrated with production and construction, focusing on the links that consume the most labor. Therefore, the reformed tools are mostly urgently needed for transportation, agricultural product processing, and agricultural infrastructure construction. Jin southeast has already opened five indigenous railways (13 kilometers), and twenty-seven are under construction or survey and design. Indigenous railways are also being vigorously developed in southern Shanxi, central Shanxi, and northern Shanxi. This will play a certain role in solving the tense transportation problem. People happily say: "A small indigenous railway, rumbling day and night, not afraid of wind, snow, and rain, travels back and forth as fast as the wind." In terms of agricultural product processing, electric rolling mills, small steel mills, rice milling machines, wooden noodle pressing machines, potato flour milling machines, and other indigenous, semi-foreign, and semi-indigenous machinery that can greatly save labor and improve work efficiency have been manufactured in large numbers throughout the province and put into production. According to statistics from the 27 public canteens of the Satellite People's Commune in Changzhi City alone, 240 laborers have been saved.

An important feature of this new tool reform upsurge is that leading departments at all levels pay close attention to closely combining tool reform and tool use, gradually achieving simultaneous reform, promotion, and use; reforming as much as possible, promoting as much as possible, and using as much as possible. All localities pay special attention to mobilizing the masses in this movement.

In order to gradually transform the tool reform movement into an electrification and mechanization movement for the people's communes, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction recently put forward specific requirements for the tool reform in 1959, requiring leading departments at all levels throughout the province to establish specialized agencies to ensure the completion of experiments and mass production of new tools for deep plowing, irrigation, transportation, power, excavation, close planting, rice transplanting, cultivation, harvesting, agricultural product processing, animal husbandry, and machinery manufacturing this year. In this tool reform movement centered on "Four Indigenous Technologies," forms such as on-site observation, exhibitions, comparisons, and mobile performances should be adopted to ensure that new achievements, new creations, and new experiences in every corner are promoted in a timely manner.

### 向工具要粮　向科学要粮  山西以“四土化”为中心改革工具

    向工具要粮　向科学要粮
    山西以“四土化”为中心改革工具
    本报太原22日电　山西省农村以“四土化”（土机床、土机械、土电机、土铁路）为中心的工具改革运动正在普遍展开。到最近为止，全省已经创造和改良的各种工具有八百六十多万件。这些新创造和经过改革的工具，使生产效率普遍地提高了二倍以上，提高最多的达六十六倍左右。
    山西省这次规模更大的工具改革运动是在去年11月以后开始的，并且是适应着1959年更大更好更全面的跃进的要求形成的。1959年更大的跃进不仅需要对全省二千六百万亩基本农田和一千六百万亩田园化土地进行深耕细作，加强田间管理，而且需要进行许多基本建设工程，这一切都需要投入更多的劳动力。山西省各级党组织和农业领导部门便在去年秋季及时地提出了“向工具要粮、向巧干要粮、向科学要粮”的口号，并且决定在全省掀起一个群众性的更广泛更深入的工具改革运动，把工具改革的范围从水利建设工地扩大到包括农业生产、基本建设、动力机械、运输和生活方面去。因为各地这个运动都抓紧了创造工具的工具的生产——“四土化”，全省的工具改革运动便得到迅速的开展。
    山西省以“四土化”为中心的工具改革运动最近以来一直是紧密结合生产建设，抓住耗费劳力最多的环节进行的。因此，改革的工具也大部分是运输、农产品加工和农业基本建设等方面迫切需要的。晋东南已经有五条（十三公里）土铁路通车，二十七条正在施工或勘察设计。在晋南、晋中和晋北地区也在大闹土铁路。这对解决紧张的运输问题，将起一定作用。人们高兴地说：“一条土制小铁路，日日夜夜响轰隆，不怕风雪和雨阻，往来奔驰快如风。”在农产品加工上，电动回滚辗、小钢磨、辗米机、木制压面机、薯类磨粉机等可以大大节省劳动力和提高工作效率的土机械、半洋半土机械，已经在全省各地制造了很多，并投入了生产，仅据长治市卫星人民公社二十七个公共食堂统计，就节省了二百四十个劳力。
    这个新的工具改革高潮中的重要特点是：各级领导部门十分注意把改革工具和使用工具紧密地结合起来，逐步地做到了边改、边推广、边使用；改多少、推广多少、用多少。各地在这个运动中特别注意发动群众。
    为使工具改革运动逐步地变成人民公社的电气化、机械化运动。山西省农业建设厅最近对1959年的工具改革提出了具体要求，要求全省各级领导部门必须建立专门的机构，保证在今年完成深耕、灌溉、运输、动力、掘土、密植、插秧、中耕、收割、农产品加工、畜牧和机械制造等方面的新工具的试验和大批生产。在这个以“四土化”为中心的工具改革运动中，要采取现场观摩、展览、评比、巡回表演等形式，使各个角落里的新成就、新创造、新经验得到及时推广。
