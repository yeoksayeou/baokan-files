Superiority of Advanced Cooperatives, Even Greater Superiority of Communes

    (Our report) The Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, while thoroughly studying the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" and carrying out commune rectification, is experiencing a mass upsurge of summing up the advantages of people's communes, gradually forming from top to bottom.

    The Dongjiao People's Commune was established on September 10th last year. As soon as it was established, it showed strong vitality like the rising sun, organizing the broad masses of commune members to participate in the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn planting, and the mass movement to produce iron and steel, achieving remarkable results. From the short four months of practice, the commune members, through seminars, discussions, and presenting facts, affirmed that the commune has ten major advantages:

    (1) Vigorously developing iron and steel and running industries on a large scale. From the establishment of the commune to the present, they have produced 600 tons of steel and 2,350 tons of iron during the intense "three autumns" work, and the commune has established 18 industrial projects with 228 factories (groups).

    (2) Good wheat planting. The commune's 60,000 mu of wheat fields have generally met the requirements of garden-style cultivation. Commune members said that this was something that could not be found or seen since the beginning of time, but it has been achieved after communization.

    (3) Laying a good foundation for agricultural mechanization and electrification. Currently, the commune has 17 tractors, more than 400 rubber-wheeled carts, 10 electric mills, 16 electric wells, two hydroelectric power stations, three electric irrigation stations, 61 pumping machines with more than 2,000 horsepower, and some villages in seven brigades (out of 15 brigades in the commune) have started to have electric lights. The rapid development of these basic construction projects and the benefits they bring to the commune members make it clear to them that advanced cooperatives are superior, and communes are even more superior.

    (4) Most areas have initially built self-flowing irrigation and electric irrigation networks, with interconnected ditches and linked ponds and springs, ensuring that these basic farmlands have water when needed, and as much as needed.

    (5) Creating conditions for planting according to local conditions. This year's planting plan for the commune is based on the principle of planting according to local conditions. The area north of the Jiaoji Railway is mainly planted with wheat, rice, and vegetables, while the area south of the railway is mainly planted with minor grains and forestry and fruit trees. Yan Ruixiang of the Niuwang Brigade said: In the past, advanced cooperatives were good, but planting was still restricted due to limited land. After the establishment of the commune, this problem was solved.

    (6) Promoting the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. Not long after the establishment of the commune, it developed three fish farms, one chicken, duck, and bee farm each, and four orchards.

    (7) Creating conditions for implementing a distribution system combining wages and supply. Zhao Hongying of the Pei Liang Brigade said that when the commune was first established, some of us were afraid of losing out. After the wage assessment in November last year, the cash income of this company can reach more than 12,000 yuan for the whole year, an increase of 3,000 yuan compared with the annual income of the advanced cooperative, and wages are paid monthly, so the commune members do not lack spending money, and they feel more at ease.

    (8) Great development of commerce. The commune now has 51 stores, comprehensive retail stores, purchasing stations, etc., forming a commercial network with a store in every team. Through these "logistics departments," the commune members' means of production and living materials are supplied in a timely manner. Sales in the past four months have doubled compared with the same period in 1957.

    (9) Great development of welfare undertakings. To meet the needs of the broad masses, the commune has established 256 canteens, 94 kindergartens, 24 maternity hospitals, 17 homes for the elderly, and is also piloting a free hospital. The establishment of these undertakings has greatly liberated the productive forces, especially women, who are happy from the bottom of their hearts. They calculated that out of the 19,000 households in the commune, if each household had one person cooking, it would require 19,000 female laborers. Now that the canteens have been established, only more than 2,000 cooks are needed.

    (10) Great development of cultural and educational undertakings. After the establishment of the commune, they established seven middle schools, one university, and seventy primary schools, and all children of school age have been enrolled. There are sixty clubs, sixty-one amateur theater groups, twenty-five libraries, sixteen writing groups, one cultural palace, and one bookstore, greatly enriching the masses' cultural nourishment and recreational life.

    Through summing up, the Dongjiao Commune has enabled the commune members to specifically see the significant benefits brought by communization; the commune members have specifically understood that labor and means of production can be used more rationally and effectively than before, thus further enhancing their confidence in running the people's commune well. At present, more than 40,000 laborers are carrying out deep plowing, manure accumulation, and topdressing. (Zhu Yuemei)

### 高级社优越  公社更优越

    高级社优越  公社更优越
    本报讯　山东省历城县东郊人民公社，在深入学习中共中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，进行整社的同时，一个群众性的总结人民公社优越性的热潮，正自上而下逐渐形成。
    东郊人民公社是去年9月10日成立的。它一成立，就像初升的太阳一样，显示了强大的生命力，组织广大社员投入了秋收、秋耕、秋种和大搞钢铁的群众运动，并取得显著的成绩。社员群众从短短的四个月的实践中，通过座谈、讨论、摆事实，肯定了公社有十大优越性：
      （1）大搞钢铁，大办工业。从公社成立到现在，他们在紧张的
  “三秋”工作中，炼出了六百吨钢，二千三百五十吨铁，社办工业十八个项目，有二百二十八个厂（组）。
    （2）小麦种的好。全社六万亩小麦田，普遍达到园田化的要求。社员们说，这是盘古以来找不着看不到的事情，公社化后办到了。
      （3）为农业机械化、电气化奠定较好的基础。现在这个公社有十七台拖拉机，四百多辆胶轮大车，十盘电磨，十六眼电力井，两个水力发电站，三个电灌站，二千多马力的六十一部抽水机，七个大队（全社十五个大队）的部分村庄开始有了电灯。这些基本建设事业的迅速发展，和为社员带来的好处，使社员群众清清楚楚的看到：高级社优越，公社更优越。
    （4）大部地区初步建成自流灌溉和电力灌溉网，沟渠相通，塘泉相连，保证了这些基本农田要水有水，要多少有多少。
      （5）为因地种植创造条件。这个公社今年的种植规划，就是本着因地种植的原则进行的。胶济铁路以北基本上以种麦、稻、菜为主，铁道以南基本上以种小杂粮和林、果木为主。牛旺大队阎瑞祥说：过去高级社好是好，但因土地有限，种植还是受限制的。公社成立后，这个问题解决了。
      （6）促进农林牧副渔全面大发展。这个公社成立不久，就发展了三个养鱼场，鸡、鸭、蜂场各一处，果园四处。
      （7）为实行工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度创造条件。裴梁大队的赵洪英说，刚成立公社时，我们有些怕吃亏的思想。去年11月份评定工资以后，这个连的现金收入全年可得一万二千多元，比高级社的每年收入增加了三千元，而且是月月发工资，社员不缺零钱花，心里这才踏实了。
      （8）商业大发展。这个公社现在拥有五十一个商店、综合零售店、采购站等，形成一个队队有商店的商业网。通过这些“后勤部”，使社员们的生产资料和生活资料得到及时的供应。四个月来的销售额与1957年同期相比，整整增长了一倍。
    （9）福利事业大发展。为适应广大群众的要求，这个公社创办了二百五十六个食堂，九十四个幼儿园，二十四处妇产院，十七处敬老院，还试办了一处免费的医院。这些事业的创办，大大的解放了生产力，特别是妇女，她们从心眼里高兴。她们算了个账：全社一万九千多户，过去每户一个做饭的，就要一万九千个妇女劳力，现在成立了食堂，二千多个炊事员就行了。
      （10）文化教育事业大发展。成立公社后，他们办了七处中学，一处大学，七十处小学，凡是适龄的儿童全部入了学。六十处俱乐部，六十一个业余剧团，二十五个图书室，十六个创作组，一处文化宫，一处书店，大大的充实了群众的文化食粮和文娱生活。
    东郊公社通过总结，使社员们具体地看到了公社化给带来的显著效益；社员们具体地理解了劳动力和生产资料可以比以前得到更合理、更有效的使用，因而更加增强了办好人民公社的信心。目前，每天有四万多名劳力，在进行深翻、积肥和追肥。　（朱曰梅）
