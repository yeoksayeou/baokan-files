　　After finishing editing the news about the 500 cadres of the Yincheng Red Flag Commune discussing this year's production leap forward plan, many scenes of communes emerged in my mind: such beneficial discussions are probably also being carried out enthusiastically in those places!

　　This year our agricultural production will have an even greater leap forward. This is entirely achievable. The kind of drive and realistic approach of the cadres of the Yincheng Red Flag Commune is a strong guarantee. They do not make empty calls for a great leap forward; most of them do not hesitate or shrink back in the face of the new situation; they analyze and explore based on the commune's cadre conditions, production experience, mass awareness, and so on. Through analysis, they find multiple measures to increase production, determine new goals, and actively begin winter production.

　　A few cadres in this commune were also skeptical about a greater leap forward this year during the discussion, but the facts show that they also found new strength and increased their confidence from everyone's analysis.

    分析出信心
    编完荫城红旗公社五百干部讨论今年生产跃进规划的消息，心里便浮现出许多公社的情景：这种有益的讨论也许在那些地方也在热烈进行吧！
    今年我们的农业生产还要更大跃进。这是完全会办到的。像荫城红旗公社干部那种干劲和实事求是的作风，正是有力的保证。他们不空口喊大跃进，他们中大多数人在新形势面前不犹疑畏缩，他们根据公社的干部条件、生产经验、群众觉悟等等去分析探讨。因分析而寻找出多方面的增产措施，确定新的奋斗目标，积极开始了冬季生产。
    这个社在讨论中也曾经有少数干部对今年更大跃进抱怀疑态度，但是，事实表明，他们也从大家的分析中找到了新的力量，增强了信心。
