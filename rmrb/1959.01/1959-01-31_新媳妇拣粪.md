    New Daughter-in-Law Gathers Manure
    On the morning of January 10th, a biting northwest wind was blowing. A strange woman appeared on the main street of the Heping People's Commune's First Production Team. Her hair and eyebrows were covered in white frost, but she was holding a basket and a shovel, constantly bending over to gather manure. This young woman attracted a lot of attention. One commune member asked, "Which village is this young woman from, coming here to gather manure?" Commune member Wang Yonglin walked over and said, "Don't you recognize her? This is Li Quan's wife, the bride who just got married yesterday. She is also the Women's Federation Director from our district!" At this point, everyone took a closer look and, sure enough, it was the bride who had arrived yesterday. Some commune members gave a thumbs-up and praised, "She's really something!"
    Just as people were talking, her father-in-law, Li Jinglin, and mother-in-law came out, happily saying to Yuzhen, "How can a new daughter-in-law go out to gather manure on the street? Look how cold it is, your hair is all white. Come inside!" Yuzhen smiled and said, "You go back! Once you start working, you don't feel cold. Now is such a busy time for accumulating fertilizer, who has time to stay at home and act like a bride!" Her parents-in-law both laughed at this.

    新媳妇拣粪
    1月10日的早晨，刮着刺骨的西北风。在和平公社第一生产队的大街上，出现一个陌生的妇女，她的头发、眉毛上都挂满了白霜，手里却拿着篮子和锨，在不停地弯腰拣粪。这位青年妇女，很引起人们注意。有一个社员向大家问道：“这是哪个屯子的大姑娘跑到这里来拣粪？”社员王永林走过来说：“你们不认识吗？这是李全的媳妇，昨天刚结婚的新娘子，她还是咱们区上的妇联主任呢？”这时，大家再仔细一看，果真是昨天来的新娘子。有的社员伸出大拇指夸奖说：“真是头份的！”
    正在人们谈论的时候，她公爹李景林和婆婆找出来了，高兴地对玉珍说：“那有新来的媳妇就上街拣粪，你看天有多冷，头发都白了，快进屋去吧！”玉珍笑着说：“你们回去吧！干起活来就不冷了，现在积肥这样忙，谁还能呆在家里做新娘子呀！”说得公婆都笑起来了。
