Moscow Dispatch, January 22nd – On the eve of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, following the Party conferences in various oblasts and krais, the Communist Parties of the Soviet republics have recently held their respective congresses. These congresses discussed Comrade Khrushchev's report outline on the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, the tasks of the Party organizations in each republic, and elected delegates to attend the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

So far, the Communist Parties of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Latvia, and Armenia have held their congresses. These Party congresses were conducted in an atmosphere of heightened political enthusiasm. The delegates unanimously endorsed Comrade Khrushchev's report outline and put forward numerous suggestions for realizing the Seven-Year Plan. The proceedings of the congresses demonstrated the rock-solid unity of all members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around the CPSU Central Committee and showed their firm will to realize the grand Seven-Year Plan.

The Party congresses of the various republics first summarized the tremendous achievements made in various fields of construction over the three years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU. They considered that the series of major measures taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during this period, aimed at strengthening the power of the state, enhancing the creative initiative of the working people, developing socialist democracy, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, were correct. The Party congresses of the various republics unanimously pointed out that the expansion of the powers of the various republics played a significant role in accelerating the economic and cultural development of the republics. Mustafayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, pointed out in his report to the Azerbaijan Communist Party Congress that the restructuring of the management of industry and construction and the establishment of National Economic Councils had promoted the economic development of the republic. In 1958, the republic's industrial enterprises completed the planned gross industrial output ahead of schedule, and the petroleum, gas, and chemical industries have greatly developed. Käbin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist Party, said at the Party Congress that Estonia's industrial production had achieved particularly rapid development after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which was a result of expanding the republic's powers and restructuring the management of industry and construction.

When discussing the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, the delegates made many suggestions on further developing industry, rationally utilizing natural resources, tapping internal potential of enterprises, and mobilizing mass initiative in the next seven years in order to smoothly realize the Seven-Year Plan. Earnest discussions were also held on the issues of raising labor productivity, improving production technology, and correctly distributing productive forces. At the Uzbekistan Communist Party Congress, delegates, when discussing the issue of accelerating the development of the republic's gas industry, suggested that in order to concentrate forces, all construction, installation, and exploration organizations in the gas mining areas must be unified.

The issue of better serving production with science and technology was discussed at the Party congresses of many republics. At the Armenian Communist Party Congress, Professor Mairgelyan, Director of the Republic's Computer Institute, believed that the connection between scientific research and production must be strengthened.

The issue of accelerating agricultural development in the next seven years also received universal attention at the Party congresses of the various republics. At the Latvian Communist Party Congress, delegates fully discussed the meat production targets that each republic must reach to catch up with the United States, as proposed by Khrushchev at the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last December. They unanimously believed that it was entirely possible for the Latvian Republic to obtain an average of eighty quintals of meat per hundred hectares of agricultural land.

The spirit of criticism and self-criticism was fully implemented at the Party congresses of the various republics.

Delegates unanimously believed that doing a good job in political and ideological education is an important guarantee for the smooth realization of the Seven-Year Plan. In the future, it is necessary to resolutely improve the communist education of the masses and raise their communist consciousness and initiative. The local congresses especially demanded that an irreconcilable struggle be waged against the bourgeois remnants of the old society.

    总结三年来的建设成就　迎接七年计划伟大任务
    苏联各加盟共和国举行党代会
    一致同意赫鲁晓夫报告提纲并提出许多具体建议
    本报莫斯科22日电　在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会开幕前夕，继各州和边疆区的党代表会议之后，苏联各加盟共和国共产党最近先后举行代表大会，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志关于苏联七年计划的报告提纲，和各共和国党组织的任务，并且选举出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的代表。
    到目前为止，乌克兰、哈萨克、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克、阿塞拜疆、爱沙尼亚、格鲁吉亚、吉尔吉斯、摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚和亚美尼亚等共和国共产党已举行了代表大会。这些党代表大会都是在政治积极性高涨的气氛中进行的。代表们一致拥护赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲，并且对实现七年计划提出了许多意见。代表大会进行的情况显示了苏联共产党全体党员在苏共中央周围的磐石般的团结，并且表明了他们实现宏伟的七年计划的坚定意志。
    各加盟共和国的党代表大会首先总结了苏共第二十次代表大会后三年来在各方面的建设中所取得的巨大成就，认为苏联共产党在这一时期所采取的一系列旨在加强国家威力、提高劳动人民的创造性积极性、发展社会主义民主、巩固工农联盟和苏联各族人民友谊的重大措施是正确的。各加盟共和国共产党代表大会一致指出，扩大各加盟共和国的权力在加速发展各共和国的经济文化方面起了重大作用。阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会第一书记穆斯塔法耶夫在阿塞拜疆共产党代表大会上作报告时指出，改组工业和建筑业的管理工作和成立国民经济委员会，促进了共和国经济的发展，1958年共和国的工业企业提前完成了工业总产量的计划，石油、瓦斯和化学工业得到了很大的发展。爱沙尼亚共产党中央委员会第一书记凯宾在党代表大会上说，爱沙尼亚的工业生产在苏共第二十次代表大会后获得了特别迅速的发展，这是扩大共和国的权力和改组工业和建筑业管理工作的结果。
    代表们在讨论七年计划控制数字时，对今后七年中进一步发展工业、合理利用自然资源和企业内部潜力、发挥群众积极性以便顺利实现七年计划提出了许多建议。对提高劳动生产率、改进生产技术、正确分布生产力的问题也进行了认真的讨论。在乌兹别克共产党代表大会上，代表们在讨论加速发展共和国的瓦斯工业的问题时建议为了集中使用力量，瓦斯开采地的所有建设、安装和勘探机构必须统一起来。
    使科学技术更好地为生产服务的问题，在许多共和国的党代表大会上都作了讨论。在亚美尼亚共产党代表大会上共和国计算机研究所所长麦尔格梁认为，必须加强科学研究工作和生产的联系。
    关于在今后七年中加速发展农业的问题也受到各加盟共和国党代表大会的普遍重视。在拉脱维亚共产党代表大会上，代表们充分讨论了赫鲁晓夫在苏共中央去年12月全会上提出的各加盟共和国为赶上美国所必须达到的肉产量指标后，一致认为，拉脱维亚共和国平均要在每一百公顷的农业土地上获得八十公担肉类是完全可以办到的。
    各加盟共和国党代表大会都充分贯彻了批评和自我批评的精神。
    代表们一致认为，做好政治思想教育工作是顺利实现七年计划的重要保证，今后必须坚决改进对群众的共产主义教育，提高他们的共产主义觉悟和积极性。各地代表大会特别要求对旧社会的资产阶级残余思想进行不调和的斗争。
