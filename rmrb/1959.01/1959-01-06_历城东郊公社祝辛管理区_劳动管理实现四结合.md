Licheng Eastern Suburb Commune, Zhuxin Management Area
    Labor Management Achieves Four Combinations
    Combining large-scale production cooperation with fixed responsibility systems
    Combining temporary crash programs with regular labor
    Combining specialized teams with "worker-peasant-soldier" roles
    Combining unified leadership with tiered management at the district and team levels

    (This article reports on a new approach to labor management implemented in the Zhuxin Management Area of the Licheng County Eastern Suburb People's Commune, Shandong Province.)

    This newspaper reports that the Licheng County Eastern Suburb People's Commune in Shandong Province has recently developed a relatively complete set of labor management methods adapted to the new circumstances of communization in the Zhuxin Management Area, namely, combining large-scale organization of cooperation with fixed production responsibility systems, combining temporary crash programs with regular labor, combining specialized teams with "worker-peasant-soldier" roles, and combining unified leadership with tiered management at the district and team levels. After this method was implemented in the Zhuxin Management Area, production efficiency increased significantly. Now the Licheng County Party Committee and the Jinan Municipal Party Committee are promoting this method.
    The Zhuxin Management Area implements a comprehensive combination of "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery." The content of production is broad and there are many projects. In the arrangement of work, a single battalion has more than 30 items, and a single company has more than 15 items. If the plan is not thorough, labor will be transferred frequently, affecting production.
    When the Jinan Municipal Party Committee and the Licheng County Party Committee's production and livelihood inspection team inspected work in the Eastern Suburb Commune, they first helped commune cadres improve the management area, handed the problems over to all Party members, cadres, and commune members to speak out, debate, and ask everyone to offer suggestions, and finally found a proper solution. First, each production team assigned soldiers and generals, divided the boundaries of the cultivated area, and took full responsibility from planting to harvesting; qualitative and quantitative targets were set, and rewards were given for exceeding production. Each production team also fixed a basic set of livestock and farm tools. The production team also implemented a five-fixed contract system, combining collective responsibility with individual responsibility, with special personnel managing everything. Each production team also fixed several mobile shock team members. When the commune or management area transferred manpower to organize large-scale cooperation, the shock team members participated, and other laborers continued their team's production as usual. In this way, large-scale cooperation and large-scale battles were combined with fixed production responsibility systems, and crash programs were combined with regular labor. Secondly, in the arrangement of labor, the external labor needed by industrial and enterprise units and the management army of large-scale satellite wheat fields were first fixed, and the remaining labor was formed into eight vegetable teams, eleven agricultural crop specialized teams, and specialized teams for welfare, breeding, fertilizer production, and water conservancy construction. These teams are fixed throughout the year, specializing in one area, and when organizing large-scale cooperation, personnel are drawn from these specialized teams. In this way, the roles of worker, peasant, and soldier are realized, and the majority of commune members become proficient in many skills.
    The commune also stipulates that under the unified leadership of the commune, tiered management should be implemented at the district and team levels. The commune is responsible for the commune's overall production plan, carrying out major capital construction, unified economic accounting, financial revenue and expenditure, distribution, organizing labor competitions, and organizing large-scale cooperation; the management area is responsible for leading the production teams to implement all plans of the commune; the production team is responsible for planning the team's production and managing the livestock and farm tools used by the team. In industry, projects with large investments, high technology, and large labor forces are directly managed by the commune, general projects are managed by the management area, and small projects are managed by the production team.
    Through this large-scale labor reorganization, a unified rotation system for commune members was also stipulated, combining labor and rest.
    After the implementation of these new management methods, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. The masses reported: "Production has responsibility, work has goals, labor has a purpose, let's work hard!"

### 历城东郊公社祝辛管理区  劳动管理实现四结合

    历城东郊公社祝辛管理区
    劳动管理实现四结合
    生产大协作和固定责任制结合　临时突击和经常劳动结合
    专业队和亦农亦工亦兵结合　统一领导和区队分级管理结合
    本报讯　山东历城县东郊人民公社，最近在祝辛管理区摸索了一套适应公社化新情况的比较完整的劳动管理方法，即组织大协作和固定生产责任制相结合，临时突击和经常劳动相结合，专业队和亦农亦工亦兵相结合，统一领导和区队分级管理相结合。这个方法在祝辛管理区实行后，生产效率显著提高。现在历城县委和济南市委都在推广这个办法。
    祝辛管理区因实行“农林牧副渔”全面结合，生产内容广、项目多，在活路安排上，一个营就有三十多项，一个连也有十五项以上。如果计划不周，就会发生劳动力调动频繁，影响生产的现象。
    中共济南市委和历城县委的生产生活检查团在东郊公社检查工作时，首先帮助公社干部在这个管理区进行改进，把问题交给全体党员、干部和广大社员鸣放辩论、发动大家献策献计，终于找到了妥善的解决方法。首先在每个生产队定兵定将，划分耕作区界，从种到收一包到底；定质定量，超产提成奖励，每个生产队还固定一套基本的牲畜、农具。生产队又实行五定包工制，使集体负责和个人负责相结合，事事有专人管理。每个生产队还固定几个机动的突击队员，在公社或管理区抽调人马，组织大协作时，就由突击队员参加，其他劳力照常进行本队的生产。这样大协作和大兵团作战与固定生产责任制，突击与经常的劳动，就结合起来了。其次，在劳动力的安排上，首先将工业、企业单位需要的外调劳力和大片卫星麦田的管理大军固定下来，下余的劳力组成八个蔬菜队，十一个农作物专业队，还有福利、饲养、造肥、水利建设等专业队。这些队常年固定、各专一门，在组织大协作时，从这些专业队里抽调人员。这样就实现了亦工亦农亦兵，并使广大社员一专多能。
    这个社还规定在公社统一领导下，实行区队分级管理。公社负责全社生产规划，进行大的基本建设，经济统一核算，财务收支、分配，组织劳动竞赛，组织大协作；管理区负责领导各生产队贯彻执行公社的一切计划；生产队负责计划本队生产、管理本队使用的牲畜农具。在工业上，凡是投资大、技术高、用人多的项目，由公社直接管理，一般的归管理区，小型的归生产队。
    通过这次劳力大整顿，还规定了社员统一的轮休制度，使劳动和休息结合起来了。
    实行这些新的管理方法以后，大大提高了干部和群众的积极性。群众反映：“生产有责任，工作有目标，劳动有奔头，放足劲干吧”！
