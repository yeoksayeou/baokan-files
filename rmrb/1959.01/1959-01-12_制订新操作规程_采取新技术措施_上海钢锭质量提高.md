Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 11th: Since the new year, Shanghai's major steel plants have fully mobilized the masses, continuing their efforts and pressing forward to focus on improving steel quality. In the past week, even though the raw materials used in all major steelmaking workshops were mostly local iron, the quality of steel ingots has significantly improved. The lowest qualified ingot rate reached 95.25%, and the highest reached 99.7%, with the majority being first-class and second-class products, capable of being rolled into excellent steel.

Around the new year, while Shanghai was joyously celebrating the early completion of its annual steel leap forward targets, the Party organizations of various steel plants seized the opportunity to separately convene workshop leaders, furnace chiefs, veteran workers, and advanced producers to study the production for the first quarter of this year and to hold discussions on the current quality situation. During the discussions, workers pointed out that in the new year, all aspects of production and construction would see a comprehensive and greater leap forward, requiring more high-quality steel. Therefore, steelmaking workers should not only aim for high output this year but also for high quality.

Currently, Shanghai Steel Plants No. 1, No. 3, and No. 6 are all mobilizing the masses to summarize last year's experience, formulate new operating procedures, and adopt new technical measures. The general Party branch of the open-hearth furnace workshop at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 organized the masses to conduct special "airing of views" sessions on how to further improve steel quality, with workers posting hundreds of big-character posters. The No. 1 converter workshop at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 convened veteran workers for several days to study methods for improving quality; the No. 2 converter workshop mobilized the masses to summarize last year's operating experience and immediately introduced and promoted effective experiences for improving quality.

After mobilizing the masses for discussion, various plants adopted a series of new improvement measures and affirmed many good experiences. For example, using a hot blast stove in the iron-smelting furnace can improve desulfurization. After the No. 2 converter workshop at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 adopted a hot blast stove, the molten iron temperature increased from around 1300 degrees Celsius in the past to over 1350 degrees Celsius, greatly enhancing the desulfurization effect. Combined with strict weighing of pig iron to ensure correct batching, the sulfur content in molten iron has been greatly reduced. Steelworkers in front of the converter furnace also tried to appropriately extend the slag-making time and increase the number of slag-making operations when time allowed. Since the beginning of this year, a large number of first-class products have emerged. On the 7th, out of the fourteen furnaces of steel made by Zhou Zhiguang's team in the first shift, eleven were first-class products, two were second-class products, and only one was third-class, all of which were qualified. On the same day, workers in Chen Miaofang's team in the third shift closely monitored the composition of each furnace of steel and constantly improved operations, producing seven furnaces of steel, all of which were first-class. In order to produce more good steel, the No. 1 converter workshop strengthened the weighing of pig iron, sampling of molten iron, and other tasks. From the 2nd to the 8th, a total of 519 furnaces of steel were produced, with a qualification rate of 98.65%. The phenomenon of exceeding standards and being scrapped due to excessive sulfur content has not occurred even once since the beginning of this year. By the 7th, the open-hearth furnace workshop at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 had also produced more than 2,300 tons of high-quality steel, with a quality rate of 99.7%, many of which were electric welding rod steel and rebar steel urgently needed for construction.

### 制订新操作规程　采取新技术措施  上海钢锭质量提高

    制订新操作规程　采取新技术措施
    上海钢锭质量提高
    新华社上海11日电　上海各大型钢铁厂新年以来全面发动群众，再接再厉乘胜追击，大抓钢的质量。一个星期以来，所有大型炼钢车间用的原料大部分还是土铁，但是钢锭的质量却有很大的提高，钢锭合格率最低达到95.25％，最高达到99.7％，而且大部分都是一级品和二级品，都能轧成很好的钢材。
    新年前后，上海正在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝提前完成全年钢铁跃进指标的时候，各钢铁厂党组织就抓紧时机分头召集各车间的工段长、炉长、老工人、先进生产者，研究今年第一季度的生产，并且针对当前质量情况进行座谈。工人们在座谈中都提出：在新的一年中，各方面的生产建设将出现全面的更大的跃进，需要更多质地优良的钢材，因此炼钢工人今年不仅要高产，而且要高质。
    现在，上钢一厂、三厂、六厂都在发动群众总结去年的经验，制订新的操作规程、采取新的技术措施。上钢一厂平炉车间党总支就怎样进一步提高钢的质量问题组织群众进行专题鸣放，工人们贴出几百张大字报。上钢三厂第一转炉车间连续几天召集老工人研究提高质量的方法；第二转炉车间发动群众总结去年的操作经验，并且把提高质量有效的经验马上先行介绍推广。
    发动群众讨论以后，各厂采取了一系列新的改进措施，肯定了许多好经验。例如化铁炉用了热风炉以后，可以提高去硫效果。上钢三厂第二转炉车间采用热风炉以后，铁水温度从过去的一千三百度左右提高到一千三百五十度以上，大大提高了去硫的作用，加上生铁严格过磅，做到配料正确等方法，铁水中含硫量大大降低。转炉炉前炼钢工人也设法在时间允许的条件下，适当地延长造渣时间，增加造渣次数，今年以来，涌现了大批的一级品。7日，第一班周志光小组炼的十四炉钢中，有十一炉是一级品，两炉二级品，只有一炉是三级品，全部合格。同日，第三班陈妙芳小组工人密切注意每炉钢的成分，随时改进操作，共炼了七炉钢，炉炉都是一级品。第一转炉车间为了多炼好钢，加强了生铁过磅、铁水取样等工作，从2日到8日，共炼了五百一十九炉钢，合格率达到98.65％。过去由于含硫过高而出格报废的现象，今年以来一次也没有发生过。上钢一厂平炉车间到7日为止，也炼出了二千三百多吨优质钢，这些钢的质量达到99.7％，其中许多是建设上迫切需要的电焊条钢、螺纹钢。
