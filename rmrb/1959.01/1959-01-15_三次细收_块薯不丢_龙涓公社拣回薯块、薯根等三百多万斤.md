According to a report in the Fujian Daily, the Longjuan Commune in Anxi, Fujian, mobilized the masses to meticulously harvest sweet potatoes. They organized three harvests, recovering over 2 million jin of potato leaves, over 500,000 jin of small potato pieces, and over 1 million jin of potato roots from more than 10,000 mu of sweet potato fields. This ensured that every potato piece was brought home, preparing sufficient winter feed for the commune's over 14,000 pigs.

Last year, Longjuan Commune planted over 10,000 mu of sweet potatoes, achieving a bumper harvest. To ensure thorough digging and meticulous harvesting, the commune recently re-examined all the sweet potato fields. It was found that in the Juxi Brigade's 1,072 mu of potato fields, due to careful harvesting and thorough digging, every potato leaf, piece, and root had been collected, yielding over 350,000 jin of small potato pieces and leaves, providing ample feed for the pigs. In contrast, the Meiling Brigade harvested more roughly, resulting in insufficient feed. In previous years, two pigs had three vats of feed prepared, but this year, four pigs didn't even have one vat of feed. After discovering this problem, the Longjuan Commune Party Committee believed that meticulously digging and harvesting sweet potatoes was the key to preparing winter feed for the collective pig farming of the commune. The Party Committee immediately proposed the slogan "Check for loopholes, fill gaps, dig up every potato piece, and pick up every leaf and root," requiring each team to harvest again and again, even a third time. After the Party Committee's specific arrangements, each team launched a mass movement for meticulous digging and harvesting of sweet potatoes. The commune first organized 1,396 elderly women, feeders, and those fighting against the frost to carry out a rush harvest and picking of potato leaves, collecting over 2 million jin of potato leaves in five days. Then, more than 4,300 young and strong commune members were organized to loosen the soil and pick up potato pieces, ensuring that every piece and root was collected, resulting in over 500,000 jin of small potato pieces collected across the commune. After the second rush harvest, the Party Committee inspection team went deep into the fields to check and found that many potato roots and small potato corners had not been picked up. The Party Committee organized a third harvest, mobilizing 850 children and women to return to the fields and pick up the lost potato pieces and roots. The commune members were very satisfied with this measure, believing that the pigs would have sufficient winter feed, and raising more pigs would not only increase income but also provide sufficient fertilizer, creating better conditions for a greater leap forward this year.

    三次细收　块薯不丢
    龙涓公社拣回薯块、薯根等三百多万斤
    据福建日报消息　福建安溪龙涓公社发动群众精收甘薯，前后组织三次收获，在一万多亩甘薯田里，多收了薯叶二百多万斤，小薯块五十多万斤，还拣回薯根一百多万斤，真正做到块薯还家，为全社一万四千多头生猪准备好了越冬饲料。
    龙涓公社去年种了一万多亩甘薯，获得大丰收。社里为了做到精挖细收，最近又检查了全部甘薯田。发现举溪大队一千零七十二亩薯田，由于收得细，挖得净，一片薯叶、一块薯、一条根都收了回来，多收了三十五万多斤小薯块和薯叶，给生猪准备了十分充足的饲料。而美岭大队收得比较粗，饲料就不足。往年是二头猪准备三缸饲料，今年四头猪还没有一缸饲料。龙涓公社党委发现这一问题后，认为精挖细收甘薯是为公社集体养猪准备好过冬饲料的主要关键，党委会立刻提出“查漏洞，补空隙，挖清一块薯，拣净一片叶、一条根”的口号，要求各队一收再收，再收三收。经过党委具体布置后，各队掀起了一个群众性的甘薯精挖细收运动。全社第一次组织了一千三百九十六个年老妇女、饲养员和寒霜搏斗，开展抢收抢摘薯叶运动，五天收摘薯叶二百多万斤。接着，又组织四千三百多个年青力壮的社员，翻松土壤，拣清薯块，使块薯条根都收净，全社多收小薯块五十多万斤。第二次抢收后，党委检查组又深入田间检查，发现田间还有不少薯根和小薯角没拾净。党委又组织第三次收获，发动八百五十个小孩和妇女重新到田间，拣回抛失的薯块、薯根。社员对这一措施都很满意，认为生猪有充足的过冬饲料，多养了猪不但增加收入，而且猪多肥料足，给今年更大跃进创造了更好的条件。
