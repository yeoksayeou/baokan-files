Vigorously Develop the Forest Chemical Industry
    People's Daily Commentator

The forest chemical industry plays an important role in socialist construction and people's lives. A wide variety of forest chemical products are not only important raw materials for industry, but also necessities for people's daily lives. With the overall leap forward in China's economic construction and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demand for forest chemical products is increasing. The forest chemical industry must have a greater leap forward to adapt to the development of the situation. At present, the mass movement of forest chemical production, which is being carried out under the leadership of local Party committees, points out a broad road for vigorously developing the forest chemical industry.

For a long time, China's forest chemical industry has been a relatively weak link. The reason why the forest chemical industry has not been able to develop rapidly is mainly because some people regard the forest chemical industry as too mysterious, thinking that "the forest chemical industry is complex, there is no equipment, lack of experience, and do not understand the technology," so it cannot be done. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, in the upsurge of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, this mysterious view and various concerns have been broken by the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses. The masses use simple equipment and tools such as old wooden barrels, sand cylinders, and iron pots to produce standard forest chemical products. Small-scale forest chemical production by local methods is in full swing in many areas. In just a few months, about 20,000 small forest chemical factories of various types have been established across the country, and the output of various products has increased rapidly. Rosin, which has always relied on imports before liberation, reached an output of 120,000 tons in 1958. All these powerfully show that as long as the mass forest chemical production is carried out, forest resources can be fully utilized and the timely supply of forest chemical products can be guaranteed.

China has a vast area of mountainous and forest areas, with many forests and wild plants. Every grass and tree is a valuable raw material for the forest chemical industry. Although this resource is large in quantity, it is scattered. Therefore, only by establishing small factories can this valuable resource be fully utilized. At the same time, because the equipment for small-scale forest chemical production is simple, the investment is small, the technology is easy to master, and the returns are quick, it is very suitable for people's communes to run. In particular, people's communes in mountainous and forest areas can obtain raw materials locally, spend very little money, and have very low costs, while the economic value of the products produced is very high, and the country is also in urgent need. Therefore, vigorously developing the forest chemical industry in people's communes in mountainous and forest areas can not only meet the needs of the country, but also greatly increase the income of the communes, which is of great importance to promoting the industrialization of people's communes in mountainous areas and the prosperity of the mountain economy. Jinqi People's Commune in Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, has already set a good example in this regard (see today's edition of this newspaper). People's communes in mountainous and forest areas across the country can, according to local resource conditions, adapt to local conditions, obtain materials locally, start with local methods first, mobilize the broad masses, and vigorously run various types of forest chemical factories. Party committees and relevant departments at all levels should regard small-scale forest chemical production as an important part of the development of industry in people's communes in mountainous and forest areas, actively promote it, and strengthen leadership, so that small-scale forest chemical production can rapidly flourish in the vast mountainous and forest areas of our country, so as to accelerate the industrialization of people's communes in mountainous areas.

To carry out the mass movement of forest chemical production, we must resolutely implement the policy of "commune-run as the main, small-scale as the main, and starting with local methods first," and at the same time appropriately develop small and medium-sized forest chemical enterprises that combine indigenous and foreign methods. Without relying on the masses and without implementing the policy of small-scale local methods, the forest chemical industry cannot be widely and massively developed. Forestry enterprises must also first focus on small-scale and starting with local methods, and then improving after starting, to develop the forest chemical industry as quickly as possible. On the other hand, with the development of industrialization in people's communes, collective strength is stronger, and it is possible and necessary for people's communes to appropriately run some forest chemical factories that combine indigenous and foreign methods.

Strengthening technical guidance and cultivating technical forces are important links in carrying out forest chemical industry production. If this link is grasped well, a mass upsurge in forest chemical industry production will quickly appear. The reason why Zhejiang Province was able to establish more than 10,000 forest chemical factories of various types in a short period of time is precisely because it tightly grasped this link. Their methods are: organizing cadres to conduct experiments on a large scale, and at the same time sending people to advanced factories to learn. Once the experiments are successful and they have learned, they quickly spread and promote them; holding on-site meetings, organizing visits and exhibitions, and exchanging technical experiences; opening technical training classes in key forest chemical factories to train a large number of commune members and forest farm workers as technicians. The experience of Zhejiang Province can be used for reference by all localities.

In order to develop the forest chemical industry in a planned way, all localities should, in accordance with the principles of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, formulate plans for the development of the forest chemical industry based on resource conditions, and pay attention to the division of labor and cooperation between urban and rural areas, regions, and departments. At the same time, it is necessary to appropriately and gradually develop comprehensive joint processing plants according to conditions, so as to fully utilize various raw materials to manufacture a variety of products. While vigorously developing the forest chemical industry, all localities must also pay attention to protecting and cultivating forest and forest by-product resources, so as to facilitate long-term production and continuously supply the needs of construction.

Small-scale forest chemical industry production has already achieved great results, but the output of some products, such as tannin extract, rosin, and dry distillation products, is still far from meeting the needs of the high-speed development of socialist construction. Therefore, forest chemical production in all localities should focus on vigorously developing tannin extract and rosin, and actively promote dry distillation production such as pine roots, so as to drive the overall development of the forest chemical industry. At present, the forest chemical factories that have already been established should mainly consolidate and improve, achieve factoryization, and move towards normal production; areas that have not yet started should actively try out, summarize experience, and establish them on a large scale.

    大力发展林产化学工业
    本报评论员
    林产化学工业在社会主义建设和人民生活中有着重要作用，多种多样的林产化学产品不仅是工业的重要原料，而且为人民日常生活所必需。随着我国经济建设的全面跃进和人民生活水平的逐步提高，林产化学产品的需要量愈来愈多，林产化学工业必须有更大的跃进，才能适应形势的发展。目前，在各地党委领导下，正在开展着的群众性的林产化学生产运动，给大力发展林产化学工业指出了广阔道路。
    长期以来，我国的林产化学工业是一个比较薄弱的环节。林产化学工业所以没有能够迅速发展，主要是有些人把林产化学工业看得过于神秘了，认为“林产化学工业复杂，没有设备，缺乏经验，不懂技术”，就不能办。1958年大跃进以来，在党的领导下，在全党全民大办工业的热潮中，这种神秘观点和种种顾虑，被群众的干劲和智慧打破了，群众利用旧木桶、沙缸、铁锅等简单的设备和工具同样生产出了合乎标准的林产化学产品，小土群的林产化工生产在很多地区搞得热火朝天，仅仅在几个月的时间内，全国办起了各种小型的林产化工厂约两万个，各种产品的产量迅速增加。解放前一直依靠进口的松香，1958年产量已达十二万吨。这些都有力地说明，只要把群众性的林产化工生产搞起来，就能够充分利用森林资源，保证林产化工产品的及时供应。
    我国山区和林区面积广大，森林和野生植物较多，一草一木都是林产化学工业的宝贵原料，这种资源虽然数量较大，但是分散的，因而只有兴办小型工厂，才能充分利用这项宝贵的资源。同时由于小型的林产化工生产的设备简单，投资很少，技术容易掌握，收效快，很适于人民公社兴办。特别是山区和林区的人民公社举办这种工业，原料完全可以就地取材，花钱很少，成本很低，而生产出来的产品经济价值却很高，国家也迫切需要。因此，山区和林区的人民公社大力发展林产化学工业，不仅可以满足国家需要，还可以使公社的收入大大增加，对促进山区人民公社的工业化和繁荣山区经济都有重要作用。浙江省龙泉县锦旗人民公社在这方面已经作出了良好的榜样（见今日本报本版）。全国山区和林区的人民公社都可以根据当地资源条件，因地制宜，就地取材，用土法先上马，发动广大群众，大力举办各种类型的林产化学工厂。各地党委和有关部门应该把小型的林产化工生产看作是山区和林区人民公社发展工业的一个重要内容，要积极加以促进，并加强领导，让小型的林产化工生产迅速在我国的广大山区和林区遍地开花，以加速山区人民公社的工业化。
    开展群众性的林产化工生产运动，必须坚决贯彻“社办为主，小型为主，土法先上马”的方针，同时适当地发展土洋结合的中小型林产化工企业。不依靠群众，不贯彻小土群的方针，林产化学工业便无法广泛地大量地发展起来。林业企业单位也必须是首先以小型为主，土法先上马，上马后再提高的办法，尽速地发展林产化学工业。另一方面，随着人民公社工业化的发展，集体力量更加强大，人民公社适当举办一些土洋结合的林产化学工厂，也是可能的和必要的。
    加强技术指导，培养技术力量，是开展林产化学工业生产的重要环节，抓好这一环节，群众性的林产化学工业生产高潮就会迅速出现。浙江省所以能够在短时期内就办起了一万多个各种类型的林产化工厂，正是由于紧紧抓住了这一环节。他们的办法是：组织干部大搞试验，同时派人到先进厂学习，试验成功了，学会了，就迅速传播推广；召开现场会议，组织参观展览，交流技术经验；在重点林产化工厂开办技术训练班，大量培养公社社员、林场工人为技术员。浙江省的这一经验各地都可参考采用。
    为了有计划地发展林产化学工业，各地应本着集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的原则，根据资源情况，作出发展林产化学工业的规划，并注意到城乡、地区、部门之间的分工协作。同时要根据条件适当地逐步地发展综合性的联合加工厂，以充分利用各种原料制造多种产品。各地在大力发展林产化学工业的同时，还必须注意作好森林和林副特产资源的保护培育工作，以利长期生产，源源不断地供应建设需要。
    以小型为主的林产化学工业生产已经取得了很大成绩，但有些产品的产量如栲胶、松香和干馏产品等，仍远远不能满足社会主义建设高速度发展的需要。因此，各地的林产化工生产应以大搞栲胶、松香为中心，积极促进松根等干馏生产，以带动林产化学工业的全面大发展。目前，已经办起来的林化厂，主要是巩固提高，作到工厂化，走向正常生产；尚未开展的地区，应积极通过试办，总结经验，大量兴办起来。
