Fifteen Wonders of the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture
　　Xiao Xiangrong

　　Breaking Superstition
　　At the crow of a rooster, hundreds of millions of households awaken,
　　The bright dawn shines on the platform of Yao.
　　Breaking superstition and dispelling fallacies,
　　Liberating minds and establishing wonders.

　　Three Years of Hard Struggle
　　Agricultural cultivation takes the lead,
　　Three years of hard struggle to revise the old script.
　　Striving to wrestle with the earth,
　　Endeavoring to scale soaring peaks.

　　Large-scale Water Conservancy
　　Drought and flood have always been bitter tormentors,
　　If the heavens are blind, what will become of the people?
　　A mighty army strikes directly at the stubborn dragon's lair,
　　The drought demon hides, and the waters are calm.

　　Manure Accumulation
　　Busy accumulating agricultural fertilizer in winter and spring,
　　Composting, shoveling, burning, digging, ashes, and manure.
　　A yield of ten thousand catties per mu is still considered insufficient,
　　The heart surges, chasing the flying green waves.

　　Deep Plowing
　　Advocating deep plowing to improve the soil,
　　Turning up fresh soil to increase the fertile layer.
　　Universally digging one chi or more in both dry and wet fields,
　　Killing insects and weeding to establish firm roots.

　　Good Seeds
　　Selecting excellent wheat and rice varieties,
　　Resistant to cold, expelling insects, and strong in resistance.
　　Uniform tillering, large ears and grains,
　　Early maturing, high yielding, and outstanding.

　　Rational Close Planting
　　Water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds are all suitable,
　　Close planting breaks old rules.
　　Ensuring sufficient sunlight and ventilation,
　　Steadily planting a thousand catties, raising the flag of progress.

　　Prevention and Control of Pests and Diseases
　　Crop growth depends on protection,
　　Green and yellow are not allowed to be infested by pests and diseases.
　　Prevention, medication, and killing have multiple effects,
　　Every grain is plump, weighing down the green branches.

　　Improvement of Agricultural Tools
　　The masses deeply plan and develop ingenuity,
　　Improving agricultural tools produces wonders.
　　Reducing labor and increasing speed is commonplace,
　　Praised throughout the fields, with joyful smiles.

　　Strengthening Field Management
　　After planting, it is still necessary to implement measures,
　　Diligent management is not against the times.
　　Knowing cold, knowing heat, knowing hunger, and knowing satiety,
　　Effort builds up jade-filled branches.

　　Eliminating the Four Pests
　　Eliminating the four pests is unprecedented in ancient and modern times,
　　Far-sighted and with a call to arms.
　　Rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, and flies can all be eliminated,
　　What is there to hesitate about in the world?

　　Eliminating Illiteracy
　　Books in the fields are filled with joy,
　　Lights are added in the people's schools, voices of night reading.
　　Men and women, young and strong, tackle difficult problems,
　　Competing to boast that their eyes are shining brightly.

　　New Problems
　　Small cooperatives have few people and are isolated,
　　Labor, materials, and funds are always lacking.
　　Wanting to raise ambition but lacking strength,
　　Jointly planning and discussing good strategies.

　　People's Communes
　　Small cooperatives merge into large and public ones,
　　Breaking waves after a tide of five hundred million.
　　Opening up a new look for the countryside,
　　Sunflowers face the sun, water faces east.

　　Great Harvest
　　Good news is frequently reported, and the lunar drums are festive,
　　Cotton and grain are both celebrated with increased yields.
　　Unprecedented in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad,
　　It is foreseen that next year will be an even greater leap forward.

    干涝从来苦折磨，
    苍天无眼众生何。
    千军直捣顽龙府，
    旱魃潜踪水不波。

    冬春忙碌积农肥，
    沤铲烧挖灰粪泥。
    亩产万斤嫌未足，
    心潮争逐翠涛飞。

    改良土壤倡深耕，
    翻起新泥增沃层。

    民校添灯夜读声。
    男女壮青攻路虎，
    争夸双眼放光明。

    小社人少势单孤，
    劳物资金总缺如。
    欲举雄心力不足，
    共谋合议策良图。

    小社合并大和公，
    五亿潮后破浪风。
    开辟农村新面貌，
    葵花朝日水朝东。
