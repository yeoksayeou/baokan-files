Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 10th – While focusing on production, Party committees at all levels in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are also focusing on improving the lives of the masses, and the work of the commune mess halls in many communes throughout the region has greatly improved.

In Guangxi, county Party committees, commune Party committees, and even branches generally have a secretary or deputy secretary assigned to strengthen leadership over the mess hall work. Counties such as Lingui, Quanxian, Yangshuo, Pingnan, and Bobai have established welfare work offices, and communes and brigades have universally established welfare work management organizations. Between November and December of last year, local areas successively convened on-site mess hall work meetings or welfare work meetings. Many Party committee secretaries have been cultivating mess hall "experimental plots," and cadres have also been "going to the mess halls," i.e., eating in the mess halls, helping with the work in the mess halls, and holding meetings in the mess halls. As a result, the work of many mess halls has been rapidly improved.

The mess halls of the communes in various localities are now universally making careful calculations based on the fixed quota standards, adopting methods such as adjusting the size of servings, providing thin and thick options, and mixing staple and miscellaneous grains, to ensure that every commune member eats their fill while also conserving grain. The Liangxin Mess Hall of the Hongyi People's Commune in Wuming County originally lacked planning in its use of grain, and many commune members had leftover rice every day. After rectification, every meal has both dry and liquid options, and various foods are matched in size. As a result, commune members eat their fill and save grain. From December 10 to 29 of last year, in eleven days, corn alone was saved by 756.5 jin (approximately 378 kg).

At present, most mess halls have established vegetable bases and poultry and livestock breeding bases, ensuring that each person can eat more than one jin (approximately 500g) of vegetables per day. Many mess halls have also prepared vegetables for use in the coming spring, and some mess halls have even sold surplus vegetables to exchange for meat, further improving the lives of commune members. The Hucun Mess Hall of the Chengwan Commune in Yulin earned 1,060 yuan from selling vegetables alone from October to December last year. With the improvement of commune members' meals, their lives have surpassed the level of wealthy middle peasants in the area. Commune members generally reflect that this is a "good mess hall that cannot be broken down."

Many mess halls in various regions not only have dining rooms but also supply hot water and provide appropriate care for the elderly, weak, sick, pregnant women, and children. Some mess halls have small stoves or reception rooms, and visiting relatives and friends of commune members also receive appropriate care. In order to facilitate the masses and benefit production, many mess halls implement three deliveries per meal: to the fields, to the construction sites, and to the homes (mainly for the sick or elderly). The methods of distributing rice and dishes have also been improved, ensuring that the rice is hot and the dishes are fragrant, and the masses are satisfied. (Picture attached)

    个个吃得饱　节约粮食好
    广西许多公社食堂大改观
    新华社南宁10日电　广西僮族自治区各级党委在抓生产的同时抓好群众生活，全区许多公社的食堂工作有了很大改进。
    广西各县的县委、公社党委以至支部，一般都有一位书记或副书记分工加强领导食堂工作。临桂、全县、阳朔、平南、博白等县都成立了福利工作办公室，各公社、大队也普遍建立了福利工作管理机构。在去年11月、12月间，各地先后召开了食堂工作现场会议或生活福利工作会议。许多党委书记搞了食堂“试验田”，干部也实行到食堂，即到食堂吃饭，到食堂帮助工作，到食堂开会等。因而许多食堂的工作得到迅速改进。
    各地公社的食堂，现在都普遍根据定量标准，精打细算，采取大小调剂，有稀有稠、主杂粮搭配等办法，既保证社员个个吃饱，又节约了粮食。武鸣县红一人民公社梁新食堂，原来用粮缺乏计划，许多社员天天有剩饭；经过整顿以后，每餐有干有稀，各种食品大小搭配，因此社员吃得又饱又节约，从去年12月10日到29日，十一天中，仅玉米一项就节约了七百五十六斤半。
    目前大多数食堂都已建立起蔬菜基地和禽畜饲养基地，做到每天每人能吃菜一斤以上。许多食堂并已准备了来春食堂用菜，部分食堂还卖掉有余的蔬菜换取肉食，进一步改善了社员生活。玉林城陨公社湖村食堂，去年10月至12月仅卖菜就收入一千零六十元。社员伙食改善，生活超过了当地富裕中农水平，社员普遍反映这是“铁打不烂的好食堂”。
    许多地区食堂不但有了餐厅，而且供应热水，对老、弱、病、产、孕妇、小孩都有适当照顾。有的食堂设有小锅灶或招待室，社员亲友来访，也得到适当照顾。许多食堂为了方便群众，有利生产，每餐实行三送，送到田间、工地，送到台，送到家（主要是病号或老人），分饭分菜办法也有了改进，做到饭热菜香，群众满意。（附图片）
