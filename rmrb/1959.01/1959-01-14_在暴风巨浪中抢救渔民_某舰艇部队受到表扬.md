Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 13th - The leadership of the East Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a circular to commend a certain naval vessel unit for the selfless communist spirit demonstrated in their courageous rescue of fishing boats in the midst of storms and giant waves.

    At around 8:00 AM on December 25th of last year, the leadership of this naval vessel unit learned that there would be a Force 8 gale in the afternoon. They immediately dispatched a warship to sea to notify fishing boats to return to port and then sent an additional gunboat to assist. Due to the rapid increase in wind force, a number of fishing boats had not yet returned to port. Upon learning this, the unit's leadership immediately took decisive measures, dispatching three warships, led by a deputy battalion commander, to the fishing grounds for rescue, and then sent four more warships to the fishing grounds for assistance. During the rescue process, the sailors fought bravely and tenaciously against the wind and waves. In some warships, the number two compartment was flooded to a depth of one meter, but they continued to persist in the rescue. After a day and night of hard work, more than seventy fishermen were rescued and more than thirty fishing boats were towed back, allowing the fishermen and boats in distress to return safely.

    在暴风巨浪中抢救渔民
    某舰艇部队受到表扬
    新华社上海13日电　中国人民解放军东海舰队领导机关，最近通报表扬某舰艇部队在暴风巨浪中，奋勇抢救渔船所表现的忘我的共产主义精神。
    去年12月25日八时左右，这支舰艇部队领导机关获悉午后将有八级大风，当即派一艘军舰出海通知渔船返港，接着又增派一只炮艇前往协助。由于风力急增，有一批渔船尚未返港。部队领导机关得知后，立即采取果断措施，派遣三艘军舰由一名副大队长率领，前往渔场营救，接着又增派四艘军舰到渔场援助。在抢救过程中，水兵们英勇顽强地和风浪搏斗，有的军舰二舱进水一公尺深，继续坚持抢救。经过一昼夜奋战，救起渔民七十多人，拖救回渔船三十多只，使遇险的渔民和船只，安全返航。
