Learn from the Workers, Learn from the Veteran Engineers
Tianjin Water Turbine Generator Factory, Newly Appointed Engineer, Yu Zhaoqing

The promotion of some veteran workers to engineers makes me very happy. Not because I myself have become an engineer, but because a large number of engineers have emerged from our ranks of workers.

Only in a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party can workers become engineers. The Party teaches us to rely closely on the masses. Following the Party's teachings, I constantly learn from the veteran workers, young workers, and veteran engineering and technical personnel around me. Whenever I don't understand something, I sincerely learn from others, enrich my experience, and improve myself. There is a master worker in the factory who is very knowledgeable about metalworking and layout. I learn from him and ask him to teach me scribing and layout. If I don't understand anything about electrical appliances, I seek help from the electricians. If I can't draw a circle, I also humbly learn from the engineers and technicians, recording other people's experiences in the small notebook I carry with me and carefully pondering them. Maintaining close ties with the masses, living with everyone, caring for the masses, relying on the masses, and learning from the masses are the keys to my progress.

Today, I have been promoted to engineer. This is the result of the Party's training and learning from the masses. In order to live up to the Party's training and the people's expectations, I will never be arrogant or complacent. I will always maintain close ties with the masses and humbly learn from them. I plan to reach the level of a university graduate in culture and theoretical knowledge within three years or less, and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party and the people even more outstandingly.

### 向工人学习  向老工程师学习

    向工人学习  向老工程师学习
    天津水轮发电机厂新任工程师　于兆清
    提拔一部分老工人当工程师，我很高兴，不是为我自己当了工程师高兴，而是为我们工人队伍中出现了大批的工程师高兴。
    我们工人能够当工程师，只有在共产党领导下的社会主义国家才有这事。党教导我们要紧紧地依靠群众，遵照党的教导，不断地向周围的老工人、青年工人和老的工程技术人员学习，只要是自己不懂的，我都诚恳地向别人学习，丰富自己的经验，提高自己。厂里有位老师傅，他对金工下料很有研究，我就向他学习，请他教我划线下料；有关电器方面不懂的，争取电工们的帮助；不会画圆，也虚心地向工程师们技术员们学习，把别人的经验，记在我随身带的小本子上，仔细琢磨。与群众保持紧密的联系，和大家生活在一起，关心群众，依靠群众，向群众学习，才能使自己进步。
    今天我被提拔为工程师，这是党的培养和向群众学习的结果。为了不辜负党的培养和人民的期望，我决不骄傲自满，要永远保持同群众的紧密联系，虚心地向群众学习。我计划在三年或者更短的时间内，在文化和理论知识方面，达到大学毕业的水平，更出色地完成党和人民所交给我的任务。
