Xinhua News Agency, January 24th. A grand meeting of more than 8,000 people from all walks of life in the capital was held this afternoon at the Beijing Gymnasium to warmly welcome the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl. The friendly hands of the Chinese and German people, located in the East and West of the socialist camp, were tightly clasped together here today. Their close cooperation and mutual support in the common struggle strongly demonstrated the strong unity and enormous strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Outside the gymnasium today, red flags fluttered in the wind, and the venue was decorated in a solemn and beautiful manner. The national flags of China and Germany were hung high on the curtain above the rostrum. On the wall opposite the rostrum, three red-gold slogans written in Chinese and German were hung: "Long Live the Solidarity of Socialist Camp Countries Headed by the Soviet Union!", "Long Live the Eternal and Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and German People!", "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World and World Peace!"

At 3:30 PM, Prime Minister Grotewohl and his wife, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, Mayor Peng Zhen, and other officials, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, the welcoming crowd stood up in unison, applauded warmly, and cheered enthusiastically. The spacious gymnasium hall was filled with infinite deep friendship. The distinguished guests of the delegation who were seated on the rostrum together with Prime Minister Grotewohl and his wife were: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Bolz, Deputy Minister Schwab, Deputy Minister Weiss, Professor Ardenne, and Ambassador Wang Daile. Mr. Hüttenrauch, head of the German Democratic Republic Trade Delegation and State Secretary and First Deputy Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade, who is currently visiting China, was also invited to attend the meeting and was seated on the rostrum.

Accompanying the distinguished guests on the rostrum were also Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Lin Haiyun, Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Qian Sanqiang, Chinese Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic Wang Guoquan, President of the Sino-German Democratic Republic Friendship Association Zhu Kezhen, Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li, Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Cheng Hongyi, Jia Tingsan, and Le Songsheng, as well as the heads of central and Beijing people's organizations and democratic parties.

The entire ensemble of the Erich Weinert Song and Dance Troupe of the People's Army of the German Democratic Republic, all German experts and students in Beijing, were also invited to attend today's meeting.

The grand welcoming ceremony began with the playing of the national anthems of Germany and China.

Amidst thunderous applause, Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a long speech full of friendly passion to the people from all walks of life in the capital (full text on the second page). In his speech, Prime Minister Grotewohl warmly praised the friendship between the people of Germany and China and the unprecedented strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He reiterated the firm will of the German people to build socialism and unify their motherland, and emphasized that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany would help ensure peace in Europe and the world.

Prime Minister Grotewohl confidently declared that "the east wind is blowing all over the world, bringing the gospel of peace, prosperity and happiness to all working people," and that "the heart of socialism," regardless of instigators, cowards and revisionists, will increasingly penetrate. "The red flag of the victory of the working class will one day also declare the beginning of a new socialist world over the entire homeland of the greatest sons of the German people, Marx and Engels."

Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out: "West Berlin is the center of the Cold War against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. This malignant tumor growing on the healthy body of our peaceful worker-peasant state must ultimately be excised." He said: "The Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany points out a clear vision of peaceful and democratic development for the German people."

Prime Minister Grotewohl gave strong support to the Chinese people's struggle against US imperialist interference in China's internal affairs. He said: "All US conspiracies to create 'two Chinas' and to establish US rule over Taiwan under the banner of UN trusteeship are doomed to failure."

Mayor Peng Zhen spoke first at the beginning of the welcoming meeting (full text on the second page), warmly welcoming the respected Prime Minister Grotewohl and all the distinguished guests.

In his speech, Mayor Peng Zhen once again stated that the Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city and to sign a peace treaty with Germany, and support the German Democratic Republic's government's position on striving for the unification of the German nation into a peace-loving and democratic country and resolving the Berlin issue.

After describing the current international situation of "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day," Mayor Peng Zhen reiterated: "We fully sympathize with and firmly support the Cuban people, the Congolese people, and all the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for national independence. We firmly believe that with the sympathy and support of the powerful socialist camp and all justice-upholding people and countries in the world, their heroic struggle will surely achieve final victory."

The speeches of Prime Minister Grotewohl and Mayor Peng Zhen were punctuated by bursts of warm applause from the audience. After the speeches, Mayor Peng Zhen presented banners and gifts to the distinguished guests on behalf of the people of the capital. After the meeting, German artists and actors from the capital jointly performed many songs, dances and acrobatic programs to celebrate the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and German people.
