    Railway Corps Fights in Southern China
    Over Ten Lines Advance Simultaneously; Construction of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway Reaches 40%
    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th - The Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and hundreds of thousands of civilian laborers are intensifying construction on more than ten railway lines in southern China.

    At the beginning of the new year, the Railway Corps immediately plunged into battle. The newly started railway construction includes: the San(shui)-Mao(ming) Railway in Guangdong Province, which is part of the Southeast Coastal Ring Line; the Yu(shan)-Fu(zhou) Railway, which runs through the mountainous areas of Fujian and Jiangxi and connects the three provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi; the Xin(yu)-Tai(he) Railway, which runs through the heartland of Jiangxi; and the railway from Jinhua to Wenzhou, an important town in the East China Sea.

    The projects on the various lines of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway, which the Railway Corps started last year, have also made great progress. The parts of this railway that have already started construction account for about 40% of the total length of the line. Among them, the subgrade of the Zhang(ping)-Long(yan) line within Fujian Province is nearing completion; the subgrade of the Xiangtan to Xinhua section of the Xiangqian Line within Hunan Province, which is 197 kilometers long, has also been largely built, and a large number of troops and civilian laborers have successively advanced westward; the key project of the 26 Xuefeng Mountain tunnel groups, with a total length of 12 kilometers, has already begun. On the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the subgrade of the Guiyang to Liuzhi section of the Dianqian Line of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway has taken shape, and the Yanjiaozhai Tunnel, which is five *li* in length, is being dug at an accelerated pace; the arduous project of the Wei(ning)-Rong(feng) section, which straddles the border of Yunnan and Guizhou and winds through the Wumeng Mountains, has also been fully launched, and 33 of the 72 tunnels on this section have been started; the Tianshengqiao project, known as a natural barrier, is proceeding tensely. In addition, the Kunming to Yipinglang Railway in Yunnan has been largely completed.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 29th - In support of national industrial and agricultural construction, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the vast number of railway construction workers, achieved great results in the country's railway construction in 1958. Compared with 1957, the Railway Corps achieved a nearly doubled increase in completed engineering investment, a 56% increase in track-laying mileage, a seven-fold increase in tunnel length, and an 81% increase in bridge length in that year.

    Throughout last year, the Railway Corps undertook 36 projects, including 17 new trunk and branch railways, 14 new dedicated lines, 3 restored lines, and 2 railway hub projects. Among them, the Baotou-Yinchuan section of the Baolan Railway was completed five months ahead of schedule, the Wuhan hub station was completed nine months ahead of schedule, and the Nan(ping)-Fu(zhou) Railway and the Lian(jiang)-Mao(ming) Railway were also completed ahead of schedule. Nineteen new lines, including the Fujian-Yunnan Railway, are under active construction.

    铁道兵奋战江南
    十余条线路并肩挺进　闽滇大铁路开工40％
    据新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部队和数十万民工，正在祖国南方的十几条铁路线上加紧施工。
    新年开始，铁道兵部队立即投入战斗，他们新近动工修建的铁路有：东南沿海环线组成部分的广东省三（水）茂（名）铁路，纵贯闽赣山区、联结闽浙赣三省的玉（山）福（州）铁路，贯穿江西腹地的新（余）泰（和）铁路，从金华通向东海重镇温州的铁路等。
    铁道兵部队去年动工的闽滇大铁路各线工程，目前也有很大进展。这条铁路已开工的部分占全线总长的40％左右。其中，福建境内的漳（平）龙（岩）线路基已接近完成；湖南境内湘黔线湘潭到新化一百九十七公里的路基也大部分筑好，大批部队和民工已陆续向西挺进；二十六座总长十二公里的雪峰山隧道群的重点工程，已经开始。在云贵高原，闽滇路滇黔线贵阳到六枝的路基已有了雏型，全长五华里的岩脚寨隧道正在加紧掘进；横跨云贵边境、蜿蜒在乌蒙丛山中的威（宁）榕（峰）段艰险工程也全面展开，这段线路上的七十二座隧道已开工的有三十三座；号称天险的天生桥工程正在紧张进行。此外，云南昆明到一平浪铁路已大部完成。
    据新华社29日讯　支援国家工农业建设，中国人民解放军铁道兵部队1958年和广大的筑路民工一起，在祖国铁路建设上取得了很大的成绩。这一年中，铁道兵部队取得的成就和1957年比较，完成的工程投资数增加近一倍，铺轨里程增加56％，隧道长度增加七倍，桥梁长度增加81％。
    去年全年，铁道兵共担任三十六项工程，包括新建干线和支线铁路十七条，新建专用线十四条，复旧线三条，铁路枢纽工程两项。其中，包兰铁路包（头）银（川）段提前五个月建成，武汉枢纽站提前九个月建成，南（平）福（州）铁路与廉（江）茂（名）铁路等也都提前建成，闽滇大铁路等十九条新线路正在积极施工。
