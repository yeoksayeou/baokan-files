According to the Liaoning Daily, Suizhong County in Liaoning Province is vigorously developing the burning of "fire manure" during the winter manure collection campaign. As of January 8th, the county has adopted rapid fertilizer production methods such as the hot-temperature rapid composting method, the blast furnace soil smoking fertilizer method, and the tunnel soil smoking fertilizer method. Fertilizer accumulated through these methods accounts for 13% of the county's total existing fertilizer.

Burning "fire manure" has the advantages of short time, high efficiency, simple technology, and local materials for local production and use. The Suizhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of various townships attach great importance to this fertilizer accumulation method and have held more than ten on-site meetings to promote it. Now, the burning of "fire manure" has blossomed and borne fruit throughout the county.

In the process of burning "fire manure," various localities have overcome the difficulty of insufficient firewood. In addition to fully utilizing weeds and corn husks, Tasha Township mobilized commune members to gather 200,000 jin of miscellaneous firewood; Kuanbang Township adopted a method of setting remuneration per hundred jin to mobilize commune members to gather 180,000 jin of firewood, and also transported soil to commune members' homes to be smoked and burned in the stove pits to make fertilizer. Huangdi Township laid a section of the public canteen's chimney horizontally and put soil on this section to be smoked, producing fifteen cartloads of fertilizer in half a month.

    遍地冒烟　烧土造肥
    据辽宁日报消息　辽宁省绥中县在冬季积肥运动中，大搞烧火粪。截至1月8日统计，全县采用火温快速沤粪法、高炉熏土积肥法、地道熏土积肥法等快速造肥方法，积肥已占全县现有粪肥总数的13％。
    烧火粪具有时间短、效率高、技术简单、就地取材就地造就地用等优点，中共绥中县委和各乡党委极为重视这种积肥方法，先后召开十余次现场会议加以推广。现在烧火粪已在全县各处开花结果。
    在烧火粪过程中，各地克服了烧柴不足的困难。塔山乡除充分利用乱格荛、苞米皮外，还发动社员搂了二十万斤乱柴禾；宽邦乡采取按百斤定报酬的方法发动社员搂进十八万斤柴禾，同时把土运到社员家放在灶坑里熏烧造肥。荒地乡把公共食堂的烟囱横卧一段，在这一段上放土烧熏，半月可熏肥十五车。
