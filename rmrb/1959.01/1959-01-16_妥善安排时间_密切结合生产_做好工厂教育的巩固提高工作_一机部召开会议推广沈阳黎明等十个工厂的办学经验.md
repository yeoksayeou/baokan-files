Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 15th. The First Ministry of Machine Building held a factory education experience exchange meeting in Shenyang from January 6th to 13th. This meeting summarized and exchanged the experiences of some factories in running schools, and demanded that on the existing basis, relying on the leadership of the Party, the majority of workers should be organized to study, do a good job of consolidation and improvement, persist in worker education, and strive to basically popularize higher education among the existing young and middle-aged workers in the future.

Since last year, a new situation of double leap forward in production and education has emerged in the national machinery industry system. The vast majority of factories have widely carried out worker education. According to incomplete statistics, enterprises directly under the First Ministry of Machine Building have established 1,255 schools of various types from primary schools to universities, with approximately 50% of the total number of employees in these enterprises participating. In many well-run factories, the number of participants has accounted for more than 75% of all employees. About 100,000 workers participated in the worker philosophy study movement. After eliminating illiteracy among a large number of workers, many enterprises have further taken measures to consolidate and expand the results of literacy campaigns and established educational organizations from primary school to university.

The meeting introduced the experiences of ten factories in running schools, including Shenyang Liming Machinery Factory, Shenyang Songling Machinery Factory, and North China Wireless Equipment United Factory. These experiences show that it is relatively easy to organize factory education, but it is more difficult to persist. Therefore, after organizing, we must immediately seize the consolidation and improvement.

According to the experience introduced at the meeting, to grasp consolidation and improvement, we must solve: (1) Properly arrange production and study time. For example, Shenyang Liming Machinery Factory and North China Wireless Equipment United Factory uniformly arrange production, study and various activities by the Party committee, and implement "more study when less busy, less study when more busy" to make learning adapt to the rhythm of production. Shenyang Songling Machinery Factory, Luoyang Bearing Factory, and others promote workshop-based education, and flexibly grasp the learning hours uniformly arranged by the Party committee according to the busy and idle situation of the workshop. (2) Thoroughly carry out teaching reform, and closely integrate education with production. For example, North China Wireless Equipment United Factory starts from the current production reality, appropriately takes care of future needs, focuses on professional knowledge, and correspondingly learns basic theory and cultural knowledge, and implements the principle of simultaneous advancement of professional courses and cultural courses.

At the meeting, the First Ministry of Machine Building required all factories to immediately seize the consolidation and improvement work on the basis of organizing young and middle-aged workers, and correctly handle the relationship between production and education. The main task of the factory is production, and worker education must be subordinate to production and serve production; however, it must also be seen that only by doing a good job in worker education can production be continuously promoted. Therefore, the factory Party committee is required to grasp both production and education; both oppose the right-leaning conservative thought of seeing things but not people while neglecting education, and oppose the idea of running schools for the sake of education that is divorced from production and divorced from reality.

    妥善安排时间　密切结合生产
    做好工厂教育的巩固提高工作
    一机部召开会议推广沈阳黎明等十个工厂的办学经验
    新华社沈阳15日电　第一机械工业部1月6日到13日在沈阳召开工厂教育经验交流会议。这次会议总结和交流了部分工厂的办学经验，要求在现有基础上，依靠党的领导，把广大职工组织到学习中来，作好巩固提高工作，把职工教育坚持下去，争取将来在现有青壮年职工中基本上普及高等教育。
    去年以来，全国机械工业系统已经出现生产教育双跃进的新局面。绝大多数工厂广泛开展了职工教育。据不完全统计，一机部直属企业，已经办起从小学到大学等各种学校一千二百五十五所，参加人数约占这些企业职工总数50％。不少办学较好的工厂，参加学习人数已占全部职工75％以上。约有十万职工参加了工人学哲学运动。许多企业，扫除大批文盲以后，又进一步采取措施巩固和扩大扫盲成果，并建立起从小学到大学的教育组织。
    会议介绍了沈阳黎明机械厂、沈阳松陵机械厂、华北无线电器材联合厂等十个厂的办学经验。这些经验说明，工厂教育组织起来比较容易，坚持下去比较困难，所以在组织起来以后，必须立即抓紧巩固提高。
    根据会议介绍的经验，抓好巩固提高必须解决：（一）妥善安排生产和学习时间。例如沈阳黎明机械厂、华北无线电器材联合厂由党委统一安排生产、学习和各种活动，实行“小忙多学、大忙少学”，使学习适应生产的节奏。沈阳松陵机械厂，洛阳轴承厂等推行车间办学，根据党委统一安排的学习时数，按车间忙闲情况机动掌握。（二）彻底进行教学改革，教育密切结合生产。例如华北无线电器材联合厂从当前生产实际出发，适当照顾将来需要，以专业知识为主，相应学习基础理论和文化知识，实行专业课与文化课同时并进的原则。
    会议上，一机部要求各工厂必须在把青壮年职工组织起来的基础上，立即抓紧巩固提高工作，正确处理生产与教育的关系。工厂的主要任务是生产，职工教育必须服从于生产，服务于生产；但是也必须看到，只有搞好职工教育，才能促使生产不断跃进，因此，要求工厂党委既抓生产又抓教育；既反对忽视教育的见物不见人的右倾保守思想，又要反对教育脱离生产，脱离实际的为教育而教育的办学思想。
