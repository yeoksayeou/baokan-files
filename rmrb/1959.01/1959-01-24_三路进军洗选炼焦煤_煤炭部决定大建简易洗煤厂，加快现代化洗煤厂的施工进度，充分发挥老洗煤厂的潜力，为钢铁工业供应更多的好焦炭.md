Xinhua News Agency, January 23rd—This year, China's coal industry system will provide the "Iron and Steel Marshal" with more high-quality coking coal to ensure that the "Marshal" produces good iron and good steel. According to the measures already studied and determined by the Ministry of Coal Industry, all coking coal provided by the coal industry system to the iron and steel industry this year must be washed coal that has been washed and processed to reduce ash and impurities.
	This year, China's steel production will increase by about seven million tons compared to last year; at the same time, the production of pig iron for non-steelmaking purposes will also increase significantly. This requires the coal industry to supply tens of millions of tons more washed coal than last year for coke production.
	In order to supply such a huge amount of washed coal in a timely manner, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to take the following measures immediately to rapidly increase the production capacity of washed coal while increasing the production of a large amount of raw coking coal.
	First, build a large number of simple coal washeries. These simple coal washeries have simple equipment, require fewer building materials, and can be built quickly, generally in only about three months. Last year, 28 simple coal washeries were built in various places. Although the quality of the washed coal selected is not as high as that of large-scale coal washeries, it can meet the needs of small and medium-sized iron and steel enterprises for coke production. This year, the Ministry of Coal Industry also plans to build more than 100 simple coal washeries near small and medium-sized steel bases, and strive to have 40 of these plants built and put into production in the first quarter.
	Second, accelerate the construction progress of modern coal washeries under construction so that they can be put into production as soon as possible. There are currently 13 modern coal washeries under construction nationwide; if the supply of equipment and materials can be guaranteed in a timely manner, and active measures are taken to accelerate the construction progress, six coal washeries with an annual processing capacity of more than one million tons can be put into production this year. Now, the Ministry of Coal Industry has notified the relevant units and machinery factories under its jurisdiction to negotiate and give priority to meeting the construction equipment and materials of these coal washeries to ensure that these plants can be put into production this year.
	Third, give full play to the production potential of existing coal washeries. Last year, after the coal washeries in various places promoted advanced experiences such as horizontal air valves, their production capacity has increased by more than 20% compared to the past. The coal washeries in Beipiao, Kailuan and other mines have also initially successfully tested the advanced coal washing method of "heavy media." If the plants can further improve technical management this year, promote various advanced experiences, and actively ensure the supply of equipment and accessories required for production, the production capacity can be further improved.
	In addition, the Ministry of Coal Industry also plans to widely adopt indigenous methods of coal washing throughout the country to meet the needs of indigenous iron smelting.

    三路进军洗选炼焦煤
    煤炭部决定大建简易洗煤厂，加快现代化洗煤厂的施工进度，充分发挥老洗煤厂的潜力，为钢铁工业供应更多的好焦炭
    新华社23日讯　今年，我国煤炭工业系统将为“钢铁元帅”提供更多的、质地良好的炼焦煤，以保证“元帅”出好铁好钢。按照煤炭工业部已经研究确定的措施，今年煤炭工业系统为钢铁工业提供的炼焦煤，必须全部是经过洗选、降低了灰分和杂质的洗煤。
    今年我国钢的产量，要比去年提高约七百万吨；同时，非炼钢用的生铁产量也要增加很多。这就需要煤炭工业比去年多供应几千万吨的洗煤去炼焦炭。
    为了能及时供应这样巨大数量的洗煤，煤炭工业部决定在增产大量炼焦原煤的同时，立即采取下列措施来迅速提高洗煤的生产能力。
    首先是大量建设简易洗煤厂。这些简易洗煤厂的设备简单，需要的建筑材料少，建设时间也快，一般只要三个月左右的时间就能建成。去年各地已经建成简易洗煤厂二十八个，选出的洗煤质量虽然不及大型洗煤厂高，但是能够满足中小型钢铁企业炼焦的需要。今年煤炭工业部还准备在中小型钢铁基地附近，再建设一百多个简易洗煤厂，并争取其中的四十个厂能在第一季建设成投入生产。
    其次是加快正在建设中的现代化洗煤厂的施工进度，使它们能尽早地投入生产。目前全国正在施工的现代化洗煤厂共有十三个；如果设备器材能及时保证供应，再采取积极措施加快施工进度，有六个每年处理能力在一百万吨以上的洗煤厂，可以在今年投入生产。现在，煤炭工业部已经通知所属的有关单位和机械工厂协商，优先满足这些洗煤厂的施工设备和材料，以保证这些厂能在今年投入生产。
    第三，充分发挥现有洗煤厂的生产潜力。去年各地洗煤厂在推广卧式风阀等先进经验以后，生产能力已比过去提高了20％以上。北票、开滦等矿的洗煤厂也初步试验成功了“重介质”的先进洗煤方法。各厂今年如果能进一步改进技术管理，推广各项先进经验，积极保证生产所需要的设备和配件的供应，生产能力还可以进一步提高。
    此外，煤炭工业部还准备在全国各地广泛采用土法洗煤，以适应土法炼铁的需要。
