	Man-Made Comet, Red and Bright: A Great Feat in Space
		Gao Shiqi
	At 3:57 AM Moscow time on January 3rd, a man-made comet appeared in the sky at a distance of 113,000 kilometers from Earth. It was sent into space along with the first Soviet red planet. It was so dazzling and had a long tail when it first appeared, so it was called a man-made comet.

	The scientific name for the man-made comet is a sodium cloud, which is made using the properties of sodium. Sodium is an active element and cannot exist alone in nature. It is a silvery-white metal, very soft, and can be kneaded by hand at will. However, most people rarely see its original form; it usually appears as a compound. Chemists use electrolysis to separate it from table salt; and because it changes as soon as it comes into contact with air, it is always stored in kerosene.

	In the chemist's laboratory, as long as a little sodium-containing compound is burned in a flame, the flame will emit a lemon-yellow light. Firework manufacturers use this principle to use sodium-containing salts (that is, sodium chloride) as a coloring agent, allowing its sparks to emit lovely yellow light.

	In the family of lamps, there is a type of vapor lamp called a sodium vapor lamp, which emits a very strong light by passing an electric current through the vapor of evaporated sodium. This is the best, brightest, and cheapest type of light, suitable for street and highway lighting.

	The sodium cloud released by the Soviet space rocket this time is sodium vapor. The last stage of this multi-stage red rocket is equipped with special equipment for creating sodium clouds, which is a sodium automatic evaporator, which can completely evaporate one kilogram of sodium in five to seven seconds. When these sodium clouds are first released, their shape is very similar to that of a comet, with a long tail, so they are also called man-made comets.

	The activity of sodium clouds is affected by the surrounding space matter. Its movement and deformation are related to the concentration of surrounding matter, so observation is of great help in understanding the distribution of interstellar space matter.

	Writing this, television experts will say: "Why not release a few more sodium clouds? We can use them to reflect radio waves." Indeed, as long as there are a few sodium clouds orbiting the Earth every 24 hours (as fast as the Earth's rotation), as television relay stations, television programs can be broadcast all over the world.

	These are the important scientific significance of sodium clouds - man-made comets.

    人造彗星红又红　高飞太空显奇功
    高士其
      1月3日莫斯科时间三时五十七分，在距离地球十一万三千公里的地方，一个人造彗星在天空出现了。它是随着苏联发射的第一个红色行星飞到高空中去的。它是那么光耀夺目，又在刚出现的时候拖着长长的尾巴，所以叫做人造彗星。
    人造彗星的学名叫钠云，是利用钠的特性作成的。钠是元素中的活动家，在自然界里不能单独存在。它是一种银白色的金属，非常柔软，可以用手把它任意揉捏。但一般人很少见到它的原形，它都是以化合物的身份出现的。化学家用电解的方法，才能把它从食盐中分离出来；又因为它一和空气接触就起变化，所以都是保存在火油中。
    在化学家的试验室里，只要把一点点含有钠的化合物放在火焰里燃烧，那火焰就会发出柠檬色的黄光。焰火的制造家，利用这个道理把含钠的盐（也就是氯化钠）当作发色剂用，让它的火花发出可爱的黄光。
    在灯的家庭里，有一种蒸汽灯，叫做钠蒸汽灯，是把钠蒸发后所放的蒸汽，通过电流而发出的很强的光。这是最好、最亮的灯光、也是最便宜的一种，适合于街道和公路上照明用。
    这次苏联宇宙火箭所放出的钠云，也就是钠的蒸汽。这个多级红色火箭的最后一级装有制造钠云的专门仪器，这就是钠的自动蒸发器，能使一公斤的钠，在五至七秒钟内全部蒸发，这些钠云在刚放出来的时候，它的形状很像彗星，有长长的尾巴，所以又叫做人造彗星。
    钠云的活动受着周围空间物质的影响，它的移动和变形，都和周围物质的浓度有关，所以进行观察对于了解星际空间物质的分布情况是有巨大帮助的。
    写到这里，电视专家会说：“为什么不多放几块钠云呢？我们可以利用它们来反射无线电波。”的确，只要有几块每二十四小时绕地球运行一周（同地球的自转一样快）的钠云，作为电视的反射站，就能在全世界范围内转播电视节目了。
    这些就是钠云——人造彗星的重要科学意义。
