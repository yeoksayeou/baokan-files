Guocun's "Three Palaces" and "Six Institutes"
By Our Correspondent Zhan Chao

It was late at night when we arrived in Qin County, Shanxi Province.

The comrades of the Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were still busy working. In a room at the south end, many people were gathered, reportedly holding a telephone conference to check on the "Three Grabs"—grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping livelihood.

Because we were just passing through and staying overnight, we didn't want to disturb the responsible comrades of the county committee. We prepared to sleep after eating. However, Comrade Shen Luming, the First Secretary of the county committee, somehow got the news and made a special detour to the guest room after the telephone conference. We were old acquaintances, so we chatted freely. The coal fire in the stove burned brighter and brighter, and our conversation became more and more animated. In the end, Comrade Lao Shen suggested that I stay and said, "Why don't you go and see the 'Three Palaces' and 'Six Institutes' run by our People's Commune?" This moved me, and I decided to postpone my trip to Changzhi for a day or two.

The next day, Xiao Feng stayed in the city for some business. I followed Comrades Hao Jinhua and Lu Lixian of the county committee and took a dry road to Guocun in the western countryside to see the "Three Palaces" and "Six Institutes" there.

Guocun is more than twenty li from Qin County. The whole village has 491 households and 1,693 people. It used to be an advanced agricultural production cooperative and later merged with Kaicun and Lanliu townships to form the Shangyou People's Commune, and it is a production brigade in this commune. The "Three Palaces" and "Six Institutes" originated here. The so-called "Three Palaces" are the Youth Cultural Palace, the Children's Happy Palace, and the Elderly Happiness Palace; the so-called "Six Institutes" are the Nursery, the Old People's Home, the Civil Hospital, the Maternity and Child Health Institute, the Cinema and Theater, and the Marxism-Leninism Institute (including night party schools, Red and Expert schools, and small-scale agricultural scientific research institutions run by the people).

The Youth Cultural Palace is in a large courtyard in the south of the village, with a library, an entertainment room, and amateur theater troupes, amateur sports teams, etc., making it the liveliest place in the whole village. Near the Youth Cultural Palace are the Children's Happy Palace and the Elderly Happiness Palace. These two "palaces" are both in scenic orchards, one in the east and one in the west, actually two quaint, interconnected rural parks. In the Children's Happy Palace, there is a dance pavilion, a small nursery, a small fish pond, and a small rockery made of stones—called Little Mount Hua; there is also a small sports field, with basketball hoops, horizontal bars, and parallel bars, only half the height of a person. All of these were built by the commune members in their spare time using waste materials for the children. Further on is the Elderly Happiness Palace, with Happiness Pavilion, Exotic Flower Beds, Evergreen Forest, Longevity Hill, etc., all also created by the commune members. Although the facilities are relatively simple and don't cost much money, you can feel the commune's warmth towards people everywhere.

We visited the "Three Palaces" and then visited the "Six Institutes." This has actually formed the welfare system of the People's Commune, and the commune members have considerable guarantees in terms of birth, health, education, care, and even cultural entertainment.

In the Maternity and Child Health Institute, we saw a mother who had just finished feeding her baby and was resting on a warm kang covered with a white sheet. The Maternity and Child Health Institute used to be a civil hospital, with simple wards. There were no patients hospitalized at this time, and the doctors had gone out to make house calls. The nursery is in a separate courtyard in the middle of the village. We went in during mealtime. The children were eating noodle soup in the room. When they saw the guests, they all ran to the yard, shouting "Hello, Uncle! Hello, Auntie!" The person in charge of the nursery is called An Yumei. She said that it was very difficult to work when it was first established in March last year! Later, the township party secretary, Yan Guanyang, personally led the work to eliminate the "regression" mentality of the nursery workers, and everyone's enthusiasm was boosted. Based on the principle of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, they found some waste wood to make small tables and small benches, and also thought of various ways to improve the food. There have also been great improvements in the work system. Mothers can leave their children at the nursery when they are busy and take them home to live when they are free, and they can go in to see them at any time during the day. In this way, the children don't run away, and the mothers are satisfied. Now all 157 children in the village have entered the nursery.

Leaving the nursery, we went to see the Marxism-Leninism Institute and the simple cinema and theater under construction, and finally came to the Old People's Home. This Old People's Home is next to the Elderly Happiness Palace, and it houses some "five guarantees" households and family members of martyrs who have no one to support them. It seems that their lives are very active. The old men and women live separately in clean rooms, three or four people in a room, with Chinese paintings and various pictures hanging on the walls, and flower pots moved from the exotic flower bed indoors for the winter. The twenty-one elderly people also participate in some light production activities according to their health conditions. This improves their lives, relaxes their muscles and bones, and relieves boredom. Nine old women take turns cooking in three shifts, while the rest raise bees, raise rabbits, raise chickens, and raise pigs, and some make tofu. The Old People's Home's cafeteria first ensures that they don't eat the same food for seven days, that they can eat tofu or eggs every day, and that they can eat meat once a week. They also sold a lot of chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. to the state, selling 136 yuan at one material exchange meeting alone. When we went in to visit, an old woman was carrying a basket, preparing to go to the north of the village to see her distant grandson; some old men were comfortably resting on the warm kang. Huo Ergou, 68 years old and stout, had just finished making tofu and was sitting cross-legged on the warm kang in the kitchen, talking about the past and present with his two old partners. The director of the Old People's Home, Zhao Fusheng, is a disabled veteran who is enthusiastic about public welfare; the steward, Chen Qingyuan, is only twenty-three years old, has studied for four years, and is very capable, but his development is incomplete and he is not suitable for general physical labor. Both of them are doing a very good job. Zhao Fusheng received a certificate of merit, and Chen Qingyuan was also invited to Taiyuan to attend a meeting of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. When we went in, Chen Qingyuan had just finished reading the newspaper to five or six old people, and together with the director, led us around. Finally, we entered the rabbit farm, where we saw an old man with white hair enthusiastically dealing with a group of white rabbits, sometimes sending a few well-fed rabbits back to the wooden cage, and sometimes reaching out to explore the abdomen of the doe to see if there were any changes. Seeing us, the old man casually pointed to a small rabbit and said, "Look, the third one is a little uncomfortable (meaning sick)!" The old man's name is Lu Yousheng, and he is seventy years old this year. He was poor since childhood, and made a living by herding sheep, working as a hired hand, and begging for food. After liberation, he finally separated from poverty and turned over, and now he has entered the Old People's Home. He doesn't have to worry about eating, clothing, or housing. When the weather is good, he sits with his old partners under the Happiness Pavilion playing chess, watching the children jumping around in the Children's Happy Palace, and his heart is very comfortable. The old man said: "This is a good world, the likes of which has never existed since Pan Gu created the heavens and the earth! Now I just want to move around more, produce more things, and add a brick and tile to our great commune under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." In addition to taking care of thirty rabbits, he also raises a small group of ducks, and runs here three or four times a day to take care of them.

Talking and talking, the sky gradually darkened. We said goodbye to the old people and returned to the People's Commune office. On the way, we met the commune members returning from the fields one after another. Because it had just snowed these two days, they couldn't plow the land deeply, so people used the gaps to pull corn, dig carrots, and plant telephone poles. Some people casually went to the commune's sewing factory and shoe factory to pick up a piece of clothing or a pair of shoes to take home. And some young people went straight to the bathhouse to take a hot bath. These are already beyond the scope of the "Three Palaces" and "Six Institutes," but they fully demonstrate the role of "the People's Commune as the organizer of the people's production and life."

    郭村的“三宫”“六院”
    本报记者　展潮
    我们赶到山西沁县的时候，已经是深夜了。
    中共沁县县委会的同志们还在忙碌地工作着。靠南头的一间屋子里，正聚集着许多人，听说是在开电话会议，检查三抓——抓思想、抓生产、抓生活——工作。
    因为是过路借宿性质，不想去打扰县委负责同志，我们吃罢饭就准备睡觉了。可是县委第一书记申鲁明同志却不知怎么得到了消息，开完电话会议，特地弯到客房里来。我们原是熟人，便无拘无束地聊起来了。炉子里的煤火越烧越旺，我们的谈兴也愈来愈浓。末了，老申同志建议我留下来，他说：“你去看看咱们人民公社办的‘三宫’‘六院’吧。”这一下可把我打动了，决定推迟一两天再到长治去。
    第二天，小冯留在城里有事，我和县委会的郝锦华、路礼先同志相跟上，起旱路到西乡的郭村去，看看那里的“三宫”“六院”。
    郭村离沁县县城二十多里，全村四百九十一户、一千六百九十三口人，过去是个高级农业生产合作社，后来跟开村和乱流两个乡合并成立上游人民公社，是这个公社里的一个生产大队。“三宫”“六院”就是由这里兴起来的。所谓“三宫”，就是青年文化宫、幼儿欢乐宫、老年幸福宫；所谓“六院”，就是幼儿院、养老院、民办医院、妇婴保健院、影剧院、马列学院（包括夜间党校、红专学校和民办小规模的农业科学研究机构）。
    青年文化宫在村子南面的一所大院里，有图书室、娱乐室，还有业余剧团、业余球队等等，成为全村最热闹的地方。靠近青年文化宫，是幼儿欢乐宫和老年幸福宫，这两个“宫”都在风景优美的花果林里，一个在东，一个在西，实际上是两个别饶风趣的、互相连接着的乡村公园。在幼儿欢乐宫里，有跳舞亭、小苗圃、小鱼池和一座用石头砌成的不大的假山——叫小华山；还有一个小运动场，里面的篮球架、单双杠等，只有半人高。所有这些，都是公社社员们抽空利用废物料给孩子们修成的。再过去便是老年幸福宫了，里面有幸福亭、异花坛、永乐林、万寿山等等，也全是出自公社社员们的手。设备虽然都比较简单，也花不了什么钱，但是处处都使你感到公社对人的温暖。
    我们参观了“三宫”，又访问了“六院”。这实际上已经形成了人民公社的福利系统，社员们的生、保、教、养甚至文化娱乐，都有了相当的保证。
    在妇婴保健院里，我们看到一位产妇刚给孩子喂罢奶，躺在铺白单子的热炕上休息。妇婴保健院过去就是民办医院，里面设有简易病房，这时候没有病人住院，医生也出诊去了。幼儿院在村子当中的一座独院里。我们进去正是开饭时间，孩子们在屋子里吃汤面，看见客人都跑到院子里来了，“叔叔好、阿姨好”地叫个不停。幼儿院负责人叫安玉梅，她说去年3月刚成立时工作可难做啦！后来乡党委书记阎管扬亲自领导，消除了保育员的“退坡”思想，大家的干劲才鼓起来。她们根据勤俭办事业的原则，找些废木料做小桌子、小板凳，还想了各种办法搞好伙食。在工作制度方面，也有很大改进，母亲们忙的时候可以把孩子寄托在幼儿院，闲的时候又可以接回家去住，白天随时都可以进去瞧。这样，孩子们也不偷跑了，母亲们也满意了。现在全村一百五十七个幼儿全都进了幼儿院。
    离开幼儿院，我们又看了马列学院和正在修建中的简便影剧院，最后来到了养老院。这所养老院紧挨着老年幸福宫，里面住着些“五保”户和家里没人供养的烈士家属。看来他们的生活很活跃，老头子和老太太们分别住在打扫得干干净净的屋子里，三四个人一间房，墙上挂着中堂和各种画片，地上摆着从异花坛搬到屋子里过冬的花盆。二十一位老人还根据健康情况分别参加些轻微的生产活动。既改善了生活，又可以松动筋骨和解闷。九位老太太分三班轮流作饭，其余的人有的养蜂、有的养兔、有的喂鸡、有的喂猪、有的做豆腐。养老院的食堂首先作到七天不吃重饭，每天都可以吃到豆腐或鸡蛋，每周还可以吃到一次肉菜。他们还卖了不少鸡、鸭、猪等给国家，只在一次物资交流会上，就卖了一百三十六块钱。我们进去访问的时候，有位老太太正提着篮子，准备到村北面去看看远房孙子；有的老头子正舒坦地靠在热炕上休息。六十八岁，身材粗壮的霍二狗刚作完豆腐，盘着腿坐在厨房的热炕上，跟他两位老伙计在谈古论今。养老院的院长赵福胜，是位热心公益事业的残废复员军人；事务长陈清元，才二十三岁，念过四年书，人很能干，就是发育不完全，不适宜于一般体力劳动。这两个人的工作都很出色，赵福胜得到一张奖状，陈清元还被邀请到太原参加省民政厅的会议。我们进去时，陈清元刚给五、六位老人读完报，便和院长一起领着我们四处转游。末了，走进了养兔房，只见一位白发老汉兴致勃勃地跟一群白兔在周旋，一会把几只喝饱吃足的兔子送回木笼子里，一会又伸手去探那只母兔的腹部，看看有没有变化。看到我们，老汉随意指点一只小兔说：“你看，老三有点不得劲啦（有病的意思）！”这位老汉名叫路有生，今年七十岁整，自幼家贫，靠放羊、当雇工和讨吃为生，解放后算是和穷困分了家，翻了身，现在又进了养老院，吃饭、穿衣、住房都用不着自己操心，天气好的时候，跟老伙计们坐在幸福亭下盘象棋，看孩子们在幼儿欢乐宫里蹦呀跳的，心里非常舒展。老汉说：“这个好世道呀，真是自盘古开天辟地以来也没有过！现在只想多动弹动弹，多生产点东西，替咱们共产党毛主席领导下的大公社添上块砖片瓦。”他除了看管三十只兔子，还养了一小群鸭，每天三番四次地跑到这里来照料。
    谈呀谈的，不知不觉天色已经昏暗下来了。我们跟老人们道别，折回人民公社办公室去。路上，遇到公社的社员们陆续地从地里回来。这两天因为刚下罢雪，不能深翻地，人们便利用空隙拔玉米、挖红萝卜、栽电线杆。有的人顺便弯到公社办的缝纫厂和鞋厂里去，取件衣服或拿双鞋子回家。而有些青年人却笔直到澡塘里去，痛痛快快地洗它一个热水澡。这些已经超出了“三宫”“六院”的范围之外了，但却充分显示着“人民公社是人民生产和生活的组织者”的作用。
