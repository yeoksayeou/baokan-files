A good way to solve the problem of primary school teachers.
Chen Jian

The methods of Yucheng County, Henan Province, for supplementing the teaching staff and selecting teachers are very good.

Due to the great development of education this year, the quantity and quality of primary school teachers in rural areas are far from meeting the needs. In Henan Province alone, there is currently a shortage of 45,000 primary and secondary school teachers, of which 40,000 are primary school teachers. Faced with this real problem, there are two solutions: one is to ask the higher authorities for help and wait for the higher authorities to provide graduates with higher cultural levels. The other is the method of Yucheng County: based on the new favorable conditions, that is, the establishment of communes, and the good condition that the government and commune are united so that cadres can be reduced, they rely on their own efforts to select intellectuals who are loyal to the cause of socialist revolution and have been tempered by labor to serve as teachers or principals. In this way, they quickly and effectively solved the problem.

The practice of the Party committees at all levels in Yucheng County is correct, which is based on their high sense of responsibility for cultivating the revolutionary descendants of education. They realize that the ideological behavior of the people's teachers has a great influence on students. Therefore, when selecting teachers, they emphasize both cultural level and political quality. Now, more than 740,000 agricultural production cooperatives across the country have been reorganized into more than 26,000 people's communes, and many overlapping organizations have been abolished. This new situation makes it possible, without hindering work, to select a group of grassroots cadres with appropriate cultural levels to strengthen the teaching staff, especially the primary school teaching staff.

The method of Yucheng County is worth learning from all over the country.

    解决小学师资的好办法
    陈健
    河南省郾城县补充教师队伍的途径和挑选教师的办法很好。
    由于今年教育事业大发展，目前农村中，小学教师的数量和质量，都远远跟不上需要。仅河南一省，目前就缺少四万五千名大、中、小学教师，其中小学教师占四万。面临着这个现实问题，有两种解决的办法：一种是伸手向上级要；等待上级给文化水平比较高的应届毕业学生。另一种是郾城县的办法：他们根据新的有利条件，即建立公社，政社合一时干部可以减少一些的好条件，自力更生，选择对社会主义革命事业忠心耿耿，而且受过劳动锻炼的知识分子担任教师或校长。这样他们就很快很好地解决了问题。
    郾城县各级党委的作法是正确的，这是基于他们对培养教育革命后代的高度责任感。他们认识到，人民教师的思想行为对学生影响很大，因此，他们选择教师时既重文化水平又重政治质量。现在全国有七十四万多个农业生产合作社改组成两万六千多个人民公社，不少重叠的组织机构取消了。这种新的形势，就有可能在不妨碍工作的条件下，挑选一批有适当的文化水平的基层干部来加强教师队伍，特别是小学教师队伍。
    郾城县的这个办法很值得各地学习。
