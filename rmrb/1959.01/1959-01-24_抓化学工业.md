Grasping the Chemical Industry

The chemical industry serves a very wide range of areas. To list a few major products: nitric acid, which is indispensable for explosives used in road construction and mining, as well as for many medicines; alkali, which is indispensable for manufacturing alumina, borax, paper, soap, glass, and so on; fertilizers, pesticides, tires, paints, dyes... all of these rely on the chemical industry to produce them. Therefore, in the all-round leap forward of the national economy, the chemical industry, which is directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, occupies a very important position and needs to be grasped, and grasped tightly.

To ensure the leap forward of the chemical industry, what links should be grasped?

First, cooperation. In terms of materials, equipment, and so on, it is necessary to ensure that new chemical industrial projects are put into production as soon as possible; the two "pioneering officials" of electricity and transportation must guarantee the supply of power and transport capacity required by chemical enterprises; relevant units should actively transport raw materials required by the chemical industry, such as limestone and pyrite.

Second, "open source." User units can recover waste alkali and waste acid (it is said that waste alkali used by paper mills can be recovered by 40%); those with conditions can also produce some chemical products themselves. In particular, extensively running "small-scale, indigenous groups" of chemical plants, like Jiangsu Province, is a way to achieve quick results with little effort.

We hope that everyone will pay attention to the chemical industry and actively support and develop it.

### 抓化学工业

    抓化学工业
    化学工业服务的面非常广泛。举几样主要产品来说：硝酸，这是筑路开矿用的炸药和许多医药离不开的；碱，这是制造铝氧、硼砂、纸张、肥皂、玻璃等等东西离不开的；化肥、农药、轮胎、油漆、染料……，更是样样都要靠化学工业部门来生产。因此，在国民经济全面跃进当中，直接关系国计民生的化学工业，占据着很重要的地位，需要抓它，而且需要紧紧地抓它。
    保证化学工业跃进，要抓哪些环节呢？
    一曰协作。在材料、设备等等方面，要保证化学工业的新建工程及早投入生产；电力和交通两位“先行官”要保证供应化工企业所需要的动力和运力；石灰石、黄铁矿等化学工业所需要的原料，有关单位要积极地输送。
    二曰“开源”。使用单位可以回收废碱废酸（据说造纸厂用的废碱可以回收40％）；有条件的，还可以自己生产一些化工产品。特别广泛兴办“小土群”的化学工厂，像江苏省那样，更是费力小而收效快。
    希望大家都重视化学工业，积极支援、发展化学工业。
