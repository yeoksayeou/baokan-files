Visiting the Old Commander (and an Additional Piece)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Quan Zheng

　　I often think of a commander. One holiday evening, I went to see him. Both of us were transferred military personnel. He used to be our general. In the years of battle, I marched and camped with him, and slept in the same tent at night.

　　He is now the manager of a construction company. The construction workers in his company are all his former soldiers. Two years ago, he brought them from an island in the southernmost part of the motherland to this city to build factory after factory for our motherland. Because of habit, they now call him "Major General Manager."

　　In a simple workshop (this is his office), we had a happy conversation.

　　Talking about his work, he said that leading troops now is not as easy as it used to be. When asked why, he gave me an example with great emotion and casually.

　　"In the second quarter, the Second Work Area and the Third Work Area—you know, these are the former Second Regiment and Third Regiment—in order to put a huge factory into production ahead of schedule, launched a labor competition. As a result, the Third Work Area won. The Second Work Area was of course not convinced, so at the very beginning of the third quarter, they issued a challenge to their opponents and proposed new competition content. So they fought hard, each full of energy, but some workers were so tired that they fell asleep on the scaffolding, but they were still unwilling to leave the front line, and their opponents were of course the same. Tell me, shouldn’t I stop this when I see this situation? Because our revolution, our leap forward, is for the purpose of creating happiness for the working people, and this happiness of course includes rest and sleep. So I issued an order to the construction site's police team: ‘From 7:00 pm, no one is allowed to enter the construction site.’ As a result, the next night, guess what? —The construction site was still as noisy as the sea. It turned out that the police team had been ‘bought off’ by them. I was very angry. In the middle of the night, I walked onto the tall scaffolding and found their work area director—you are familiar with him, he is my old comrade-in-arms, and I spent nineteen years of war life with him—I ordered him to take all his men back to the work shed. But at this time, several workers next to me laughed and said: ‘Comrade Major General Manager, go back and rest! You are old and can't argue with us!’ To be honest, what can I say to these people? It wasn't until they saw that I was getting angry that they had to leave the construction site. I know they must be cursing me in their hearts..."

　　After listening to this, my heart was surging like waves. For some reason, on the way back, I recalled the scene when we said goodbye to the island two years ago: One spring morning, all the officers and soldiers of our infantry division stood solemnly on the coast, with their backs to the sea and facing the land of the motherland, solemnly raising their hands to the bright red military flag that was about to bid farewell to us and swore: "We are the Party's loyal soldiers, and we will always plunge into the torrent of the motherland's construction with a fighting attitude..." At this time, our respected old general, holding his military cap, stood at the front of the line, the sea breeze gently blowing his gray hair....

　　A Note in the New Home

　　One golden morning, I took a note issued to me by the general affairs section and moved into my new home with my wife—No. 38, Staff Dormitory Building. This building was just completed not long ago. Light yellow doors and windows, snow-white walls. We moved our simple furniture into this beautiful room. We started to decorate our small family.

　　I stood on a stool and pasted Chairman Mao's oil painting on the wall. My wife stood below to correct the position of the pasting. At this time, I suddenly found a note pasted on the wall in front of me that read "Lime not dry, please protect public property." The handwriting was not good. I thought it must have been written by a construction worker who had just become literate. I gently peeled off the note. The lime on the wall had already dried; the construction worker who wrote the note had gone far away. I treasured the note, folded it, and gave it to my wife to save it; I passionately missed that construction worker who had gone far away. I know that he and his partners are now building another beautiful building for our motherland, maybe, at this moment, he is climbing on the windowsill with freshly painted paint, carefully writing the note "Lime not dry, please protect public property"...

    看望老首长（外一章）
    权正
    我时常怀念一位首长。在一个假日的傍晚，我去看他。我和他都是转业军人。他以前是我们的将军。在战斗的年月里，我跟他一块行军，一起宿营，夜晚睡在一个帐篷下。
    他现在是一个建筑公司的经理。他们公司的建筑工人都是他以往的士兵，两年前，他把他们从祖国最南方的一个海岛上带到这座城市里来，为我们的祖国建设工厂一座又一座。由于习惯了，现在他们却把他叫做“少将经理”。
    在一间简陋的工房里（这是他的办公室），我和他快活的谈心。
    谈到他的工作，他说现在带兵没有以往好带了。问起原因，他很感慨地、随便给我举个例子。
    “第二季度，二工区和三工区——你知道，这是以前的二团和三团——为了使一座巨大的工厂提前投入生产，展开了劳动竞赛，结果三工区战胜了。二工区当然还不服气，于是在第三季度刚一开始，就向对手下了战表，提出了新的竞赛内容。于是他们就苦战开了，个个精神抖擞，但是有的工人在脚手架上干着干着就累得睡着了，还不肯离开火线，他们的对手当然也是如此。你说，我见到这种情况还不制止？因为我们革命，我们跃进的目的就是为了给劳动群众创造幸福，这幸福当然也包括休息和睡眠。于是我便向工地的民警队下了一道命令：‘晚上七时起，严禁任何人进入工地。’结果在第二天夜晚，你猜怎么着？——工地仍然像大海一样的喧闹。原来是民警队被他们‘收买’了。我很气。深夜里我走上高大的脚手架找到他们的工区主任——你熟悉他，他是我的老战友，我和他在一起整整地度过了十九年的战争生活——我命令他把他的全部人马带回工棚。可是，这时候，身旁的几个工人却笑着说：‘少将经理同志，你回去休息吧！你年纪大了，纠缠不过我们！’老实说，对于这些人，我怎么说呢？直到他们看见我动火了，才不得不离开工地。我知道，他们准在肚子里骂我……”
    听完了这一席话，我的心激动得就像波涛一样的翻滚，不知怎么的，在回来的路上，我又回忆起两年前我们告别海岛时那幅情景：那是一个春天的早晨，我们的步兵师的全体官兵，肃立在海岸上，背靠大海，面向祖国大地，庄严地向即将和我们告别的那面鲜红的军旗举手宣誓：“我们是党的忠诚的战士，我们会永远以战斗的姿态投入祖国建设的洪流……”这时我们敬爱的、年老的将军，手捧军帽站立在队列的前面，海风轻轻地吹动着他那斑白的头发……。
    新居的一张字条
    在一个金色的早晨，我带着总务科给我开的一张条据，和我的妻子一起搬进了新居——职工宿舍大楼三十八号。这座大楼才落成不久。淡黄色的门窗，雪白的墙壁。我们把简单的家具搬进了这美丽的房间。我们开始布置小家庭。
    我站在凳子上，往墙上张贴毛主席的油画像，妻子站在下面给我校正张贴的位置。这时候，我忽然发现在我面前的墙上贴着一张“石灰未干，请爱护公物”的字条儿。字体不好看，我想这一定是一个才脱盲的建筑工人写的。我轻轻地揭下了这张字条儿。墙上的石灰已经干了；写这张字条的那个建筑工人已经远去了。我珍惜地把字条折起来交给妻子，把它保存起来；我激情地怀念着那个远去的建筑工人。我知道，他现在正在和他的伙伴们，为我们的祖国建设另一座美丽的大楼，也许，这时候他正爬在油漆刚干的窗台上，细心地写着“石灰未干，请爱护公物”的字条儿……
