    Since the Great Leap Forward, the Party's care and emphasis on theatrical work have given tremendous encouragement to theater workers. The Great Leap Forward has also proposed a great goal for opera work, which is to enable opera art to not only carry forward the rich and excellent heritage but also express the great era of socialism.
    For opera to express modern people's lives, it must have new scripts, and it must inherit and innovate the performing arts and techniques of opera. Both of these involve learning from life and learning from tradition. In order to make opera better serve politics and production, theaters and troupes across the country have implemented a policy of combining theater performances with touring performances. In addition to performing in theaters, all drama workers have gone to the mountains, the countryside, and the army units to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to engage in labor training. This system has effectively strengthened the connection between drama workers and the working class, peasants, and soldiers, and further popularized opera art. It has enabled all drama workers to plunge into the wave of the socialist construction Great Leap Forward, making them deeply feel the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the working class and peasantry. All of this has powerfully encouraged and moved them, making them eager to express and praise the new life on the stage. The drama workers' passionate creative desire and the objectively increasing demand for drama art, with the help and mobilization of the leadership, immediately formed a massive mass creation movement. This movement not only provides the basis for artistic creation for opera to express modern life but also is a huge driving force for promoting opera art to develop into modern drama.
    In the mass creation movement, various creative methods have emerged. A large number of mass creations contain various artistic styles, and the genres are complete in large, medium, and small sizes, with a wide range of themes. They reflect the face of our era from different aspects to varying degrees.
    In this great garden of modern dramas, from what I have seen, I find many lovable dramas. There is the revolutionary historical drama "Red Flower Hill," created by workers and playwrights from the Guangzhou Tricycle Station, and processed by professional Cantonese opera workers, depicting the Guangzhou Uprising; the Chao opera "The Party Gave Me Light," co-authored by amateur worker writers and professional writers; the Xiju operas "Red Seeds" and "Leap Forward Flowers Bloom"; the Tea-picking operas "Three Generations" and "Red Pine Forest"; the Min operas "Aunt Chen Ke" and "Sea Fisherman's Song"; the Huju operas "Mother," "The Whangpoo River in Fury," and "Spark"; the Peking operas "Red Storm" and "White Haired Girl"; the Kunqu opera "Red Glow"; the Shaoxing opera "Red Flowers in Water Village"; the Pingju opera "Sanliwan Village"; the Yongju opera "Two Sisters-in-law"; the Yue operas "Uncontainable Girl" and "Ferry in Wind and Snow"; the Shanghai opera "Wang Shunxian"; the Longdong Daoqing opera "Six Girls" and "The Last Bell"; the Qinqiang opera "Grain Riot" and "Human World and Heaven"; the Henan opera "Liu Hulan" and "Yuan Tiancheng and Incompetent"; and the Hunan Flower Drum opera "Zhang Si Kuai," etc. This is just a part of what I have seen, and this repertoire list cannot include all the excellent works in the country. Taking the above works as an example, dramas such as "Red Flower Hill," "The Party Gave Me Light," "Red Storm," "The Whangpoo River in Fury," and "Liu Hulan" vividly and deeply portray heroic images that are awe-inspiring. Other dramas also feature unforgettable characters. Some small dramas, although only depicting fragments of life, vividly reflect the growth of new people and new qualities, and praise the rapid development of life. In terms of performing arts, the performances of some of these dramas have already broken away from the simple and crude stage of the early days of modern dramas. They have inherited tradition and broken through tradition, creating beautiful new national forms. Therefore, these dramas, whether in terms of ideological quality or artistic quality, have surpassed the level of past modern dramas.
    The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in drama work in the past year are very great. However, since it has been less than a year since the Great Leap Forward, everyone lacks experience and has not well recognized, grasped, and applied the objective laws of artistic work, especially not well implemented the policy of walking on two legs, resulting in some imbalances in work. For example, it has squeezed out some time for political study, professional study, technical training, and summarizing artistic experience. In terms of script creation, there is also a situation of neglecting quality. In terms of the performance system, the proportion of touring performances is generally a little larger, and the number of performances is a little more, and the quality of modern drama repertoire is generally not high enough. The active improvement of the artistic level of the staged repertoire and the establishment of a repertoire system have not yet received widespread attention. Without accumulating repertoire, it is not possible to accumulate artistic experience well. If opera does not have a large number of traditional repertoires preserved, then its performing arts and performing techniques cannot be passed down and continuously improved and developed. Similarly, failure to establish a modern drama repertoire system in a timely manner will affect the improvement and development of modern drama performing arts and affect the construction of socialist national new opera.
    The development of the opera art innovation movement has presented us with the issue of improvement and popularization, and there are differing opinions on this issue. I believe that the policy of correctly combining popularization and improvement is correct. The popularization in opera work, for the time being, is primarily the popularization of the art innovation movement. The scale of the opera art innovation movement is very large, and the achievements are also very great, but the development of the movement is uneven. In some troupes, it is still resisted by bourgeois views and conservative thinking in art. The direction of opera developing modern dramas must be adhered to, and the experience of creating modern dramas must also be vigorously promoted. Therefore, it is necessary to popularize it to the masses, and further mobilize the masses to create, and organize professional opera workers to combine with the working class, peasants, and soldiers to create. In addition, it is also necessary to continuously create some small and medium-sized works that quickly reflect the reality of the struggle in life, are highly politically motivational, and are easy to perform in rural squares and factory clubs, in order to serve the central work of each period. On the other hand, it is also necessary to introduce the excellent works of professional writers, and traditional repertoires with good ideological and artistic qualities or harmless content and excellent performing skills to the masses. In short, popularization to the masses must also walk on two legs.
    Improvement also has two aspects, one is to guide the masses to improve themselves. What should be used to guide the masses? For professional opera troupes, the main thing is to have good repertoires with high ideological and artistic qualities. Therefore, it is difficult for opera workers to produce good works if they do not actively improve themselves, and it is also difficult to guide the masses. The primary task for opera workers to improve themselves is to improve their political ideology. Only with the leap forward in thought can there be a leap forward in art and a leap forward in career. At the same time, opera workers must also go deep into life, learn from tradition, improve the level of staged repertoires, and improve the art and skills of playwriting and performance. In a word, opera's expression of modern people's lives must pass the artistic and technical barriers. Some people believe that learning traditional playwriting methods, performing arts, and performing techniques is only useful in adapting traditional repertoires or creating historical dramas. This statement is very wrong. Performing traditional repertoires certainly requires learning traditional performing arts and techniques, and creating repertoires that express modern people's lives requires even more learning from tradition and mastering traditional performing arts and techniques, so that it can be more refined and higher, and improve faster. Of course, the playwriting techniques and performing techniques for expressing the lives of ancient people are undoubtedly not enough to express the lives of modern people. Some of them need to be transformed before they can be used, and some parts are even completely inapplicable. Therefore, we must inherit tradition, but also break through tradition and develop tradition. It is not possible to stick to the rules and rely on tradition for a living. In summary, the improvement of opera workers themselves includes three contents, that is, improving socialist and communist ideology, going deep into the lives of the masses, and earnestly studying tradition.
    Related to improvement and popularization is also the issue of the present and the past. Opera art must express the lives of modern people, express our great era of the masses, and shape heroic images with communist style. This is a historical task, and it is a difficult and complex task for opera art. A series of inheritance and innovation issues need to be resolved in art, and this cannot be rushed. At the same time, due to the different appreciation habits and artistic preferences of the masses, and their desire to see the glorious images of contemporaries on the stage, as well as the requirements to see the lives of ancient people, the Party's policy on opera work stipulates the policy of walking on two legs, classical repertoires and modern repertoires, in opera staged repertoires, which is completely correct.
    On this issue, we must wage a two-line struggle, opposing both conservatism that only wants the one leg of traditional repertoires, and the crude style that only wants the one leg of modern repertoires. The former will cause opera art to stop developing and gradually shrink and decline. The latter will destroy a large number of artistic creations of ancient people. Many excellent repertoires handed down from past eras were created by the working people or the people's writers and artists of all dynasties. With amazing power, they expressed the emotions of the vast working people who were cruelly oppressed by the feudal system, vividly depicting their situation, their lives and struggles; expressing their positive ideals, their exploration, hopes and confidence in a better life; they profoundly exposed the contradictions of class society, vividly displayed the rich historical images of the working people and their role in social development; vividly displayed the psychological state of our nation, as well as the national character of bravery, diligence, wisdom, and kindness. It allows us to clearly see "the connection between history and the present, the constant interaction between past experience and present experience." As we all know, the strong popular nature and fighting spirit in the repertoires such as "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "The Legend of the White Snake," "Killing the Family by the Lake," "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," "Sizhou City," "Dou E's Injustice," "The Western Chamber," "The Orphan of Zhao," "Qingfeng Pavilion," and "Zha Meian," etc., and the strong patriotic spirit and optimistic spirit in the repertoires such as "Two Wolf Mountain," "Niu Gao Pulling the Imperial Decree," and "Mu Guiying Takes Command" not only continue to move us and give us aesthetic enjoyment, but also still have a strong educational effect on us, giving us knowledge of the lives and struggles of ancient people and enlightening our wisdom. From the perspective of literature and art, they also provide us with incomparably rich experience in artistic creation, laying a deep foundation for our future development. Without walking on two legs, without heritage, losing tradition, that is to cut off history on the stage, making our drama art regress to the era of "cave dwellers," and also making modern drama unable to grow and develop healthily.
    Repertoires depicting the lives of people in the past and repertoires reflecting the lives of modern people should be given equal importance. Modern dramas will bring new vitality to the performing arts of traditional dramas, and traditional dramas will provide artistic experience and artistic foundation for the creation of modern dramas. The coexistence of the two will complement each other, and mutual exclusion will lead to mutual loss.
    As mentioned earlier, great achievements have been made since the Great Leap Forward in opera work. The emergence of some shortcomings in the great and unprecedented cause is nothing to be surprised about. We mention it in order to overcome it, in order to learn and implement the principle of walking on two legs in our work, so that we can move forward by leaps and bounds in the future and achieve much greater results than last year to celebrate the tenth anniversary of our great motherland.

    使传统剧和现代剧相得益彰
    伊兵
    大跃进以来，党对戏剧工作的关怀和重视，给戏剧工作者以莫大的鼓舞。大跃进也为戏曲工作提出了一个巨大的奋斗目标，那就是要使戏曲艺术既发扬丰富的优秀的遗产，又能表现社会主义的伟大时代。
    戏曲要表现现代人民生活，一要有新的剧本，二要继承和革新戏曲的表演艺术和技巧。这两者都有向生活学习向传统学习的问题。为了使戏曲更好地为政治服务，为生产服务，全国的剧院剧团实行了剧场演出和巡回演出同时并举的方针，全体戏剧工作者除了在剧场演出以外，纷纷上山、下乡、下连队为工农兵演出，和进行劳动锻炼，这一制度有效地加强了戏剧工作者和工农群众的联系，使戏曲艺术得到进一步的普及。它使全体戏剧工作者投进社会主义建设大跃进的浪潮中，使他们深刻地感受到工农业生产的飞跃发展，感受到工农群众精神面貌的深刻变化。所有这些，有力地鼓舞和感动了他们，使他们迫不及待地要在舞台上表现新生活，歌颂新生活。戏剧工作者热烈的创作欲望和客观上对戏剧艺术日益增长的要求，在领导的帮助和发动下，立即形成为一个声势浩大的群众创作运动，这个运动不仅为戏曲表现现代生活提供艺术创造的基础，而且是推动戏曲艺术向现代剧发展的巨大动力。
    在群众创作运动中，出现了各种各样的创作方式。大量的群众创作中又包含着各种艺术样式，各种艺术风格，在体裁上则大、中、小全备，题材范围很广。从各个方面不同程度地反映了我们时代的面貌。
    在这现代剧目的大花园中，就我所见到的，我觉得有不少令人喜爱的剧目。这里有广东三轮车十分站工人剧作者创作，经过专业粤剧工作者加工，描写广州暴动的革命历史剧“红花岗”，有工人业余作家和专业作家合作的潮剧“党重给了我光明”，有锡剧的“红色的种子”、“跃进花开”，采茶戏的“三代”、“红松林”，闽剧的“陈客嫲”、“海上渔歌”，沪剧的“母亲”、“黄浦怒潮”、“星星之火”，京剧的“红色风暴”、“白毛女”，昆曲的“红霞”，绍剧的“水乡红花”，评剧的“三里湾”，甬剧的“两妯娌”，越剧的“关不住的姑娘”、“风雪摆渡”，滑稽戏的“汪顺仙”，陇东道情“六姑娘”、“最后的钟声”，秦腔“闹粮”、“人间天上”，豫剧“刘胡兰”、“袁天成与能不够”，湖南花鼓戏的“张四快”等等。这不过是我所看到过的一部分，这个剧目单还不能够包括全国所有的优秀作品。就拿上述作品来说，像“红花岗”、“党给了我光明”、“红色风暴”、“黄浦怒潮”、“刘胡兰”等剧，都生动地深刻地刻划了令人肃然起敬的英雄形象，其他的戏里也出现了令人不能忘却的人物。有的小戏里，虽然只描写了生活的片段，但它生动地反映了新人新品质的成长，歌颂了生活一日千里的发展。在表演艺术上，其中有些剧目的演出，已经脱离了现代剧初创时期朴素粗糙的阶段，它们继承了传统而又突破了传统，创造了优美的民族新形式，因此这些剧目无论从思想质量和艺术质量来说，都已经超越了过去现代剧的水平。
    一年来戏剧工作大跃进的成绩是非常大的，但是，由于大跃进以来还不到一年，大家经验不足，没有很好地认识、掌握和运用艺术工作的客观规律，特别是没有很好贯彻两条腿走路的方针，产生了一些工作上失调的现象。例如，挤掉了一些政治学习和业务学习，技术锻炼，以及总结艺术经验的时间，在剧本创作上，也有忽视质量的情形。在演出制度上，巡回演出的比重一般大了一点，演出场次多了一点，现代剧的剧目质量一般的不够高。对积极提高上演剧目的艺术水平，建立保留剧目的制度还没有引起普遍的重视。不积累剧目，也就不能很好地积累艺术经验。如果戏曲没有大量的传统剧目保存下来，那末它的表演艺术、表演技巧也就不可能流传下来，继续不断的给以提高和发展。同样的，不及时建立现代剧的保留剧目的制度，也就会影响现代剧表演艺术的提高和发展，同时影响社会主义的民族新戏曲的建设。
    戏曲艺术革新运动的发展，在我们前面出现了提高和普及的问题，在这个问题上，是有分歧意见的。我认为普及和提高正确结合的方针，是正确的。戏曲工作中的普及，目前来说首先是普及艺术革新运动。戏曲艺术革新运动发展的规模很大，成绩也很大，但运动的发展是不平衡的。在一些剧团里，它还受到资产阶级观点和艺术上的保守思想的抵制。戏曲发展现代剧的方向一定要坚持，创作现代剧的经验也要大力推广。所以还要向群众普及，还要进一步发动群众创作，组织专业戏曲工作者和工农兵群众结合进行创作。此外，还要不断地创作一些迅速反映现实斗争生活，政治鼓动性很强，便于在农村广场、工厂俱乐部演出的小型、中型的作品，用以为每一个时期中心工作服务。另一方面还要把专业作家的优秀作品，和思想性艺术性都好或者内容无害，具有优秀的表演技巧的传统剧目介绍给群众，总之向群众普及也要两条腿走路。
    提高也有两个方面，一是辅导群众自己提高。用什么东西去辅导群众呢？对专业戏曲剧团来说，主要的要有思想性高艺术性强的好剧目。因此，戏曲工作者不积极提高自己，就很难搞出好作品，也就很难辅导群众。戏曲工作者本身提高的首要任务是提高政治思想，有了思想的跃进，才会有艺术的跃进和事业的跃进。与此同时，戏曲工作者还必须深入生活，向传统学习，提高上演剧目的水平，提高编剧、表演的艺术和技巧。一句话，戏曲表现现代人民生活要过艺术关和技巧关。有人认为，学习传统的编剧方法、表演艺术和表演技巧，只有在改编传统剧目或者创作历史剧上才用得上，这种说法是很错误的。表演传统剧目固然要学会传统的表演艺术和技巧，创作表现现代人民生活的剧目更需要向传统学习，更需要掌握传统的表演艺术和技巧，这样才能使它更精、更高，提高得更快。当然，表现古代人民生活的编剧技巧、表演技巧用来表现现代人民的生活无疑是不够用的，其中有一些要经过改造之后才能运用，有的部分甚至是根本不适用的。因此，我们要继承传统，同时也要突破传统，发展传统，墨守成规，守住传统吃饭是不行的。总起来说，戏曲工作者本身的提高包括三个内容，那就是提高社会主义共产主义思想，深入群众生活和认真地学习传统。
    与提高和普及有关的还有一个今与古的问题，戏曲艺术要表现现代人民的生活，要表现我们伟大的群众时代，塑造具有共产主义风格的英雄形象，这是一个历史性的任务，对于戏曲艺术来说是一个艰难复杂的任务，在艺术上有一系列的继承和革新的问题需要解决，这是性急不得的。同时由于群众的欣赏习惯和艺术上的不同爱好，以及他们要在舞台上看到同时代人的光辉形象，也要看到古代人民的生活的要求，党在戏曲工作的方针上规定了戏曲上演剧目中，古典剧目和现代剧目两条腿走路的方针，这是完全正确的。
    在这个问题上，我们要作两条路线的斗争，既要反对只要传统剧目一条腿的保守主义，也要反对只要现代剧目一条腿的粗暴作风，前者会使戏曲艺术停止发展，渐渐萎缩、衰退。后者会摧毁大量的古代人民的艺术创造。过去时代流传下来的许多优秀剧目，是历代劳动人民或人民的文学家、艺术家创造的，他们以惊人的力量，表达了受到封建制度残酷压迫的广大劳动人民的情绪，生动地描绘了他们的境况，他们的生活和斗争；表达他们积极的理想、对美好生活的探索、希望和信心；它们深刻地揭露了阶级社会的矛盾，生动地展示了劳动人民丰富的历史形象和他们在社会发展中的作用；鲜明地展示了我们民族的心理状态，以及勇敢、勤劳、智慧、善良的民族性格。使我们清楚地看到“历史和现在的联系，过去经验和现在经验之间经常的相互作用”。如大家熟知的“十五贯”、“白蛇传”、“打渔杀家”、“梁山伯与祝英台”、“泗州城”、“窦娥冤”、“西厢记”、“赵氏孤儿”、“青风亭”、“铡美案”等剧目中强烈的人民性和战斗性，“两狼山”、“牛皋扯旨”、“穆桂英挂帅”等剧目中强烈的爱国主义精神和乐观主义精神，不仅继续感动我们给我们以美的享受，而且对我们仍然具有强大的教育作用，给予我们古代人民生活和斗争的知识，启发我们的智慧。从文学艺术的角度来说，它们还为我们提供了无比丰富的艺术创造的经验，为我们奠定了往前发展的深厚基础。不用两条腿走路，不要遗产，失掉传统，那就在舞台上割断历史，使我们的戏剧艺术退回到“穴居野人”的时代，也使现代剧不能健康的成长和发展。
    描写过去的时代人民生活的剧目和反映现代人民生活的剧目应当并举，现代剧将为传统剧的表演艺术带来新的生命力，传统剧则给现代剧的创造以艺术经验和艺术基础。两者并存则可相得益彰，互相排斥则会两败俱伤。
    前面说过，戏曲工作大跃进以来已经取得很大的成绩，在巨大的史无前例的大事业中，出现一些缺点，这本来不算什么，是用不着大惊小怪的，我们提到它，是为了要克服它，为了要在工作上学会和贯彻两条腿走路的原则，以便今后大踏步的前进，取得比去年大得多的成绩，来为我们伟大祖国十周年献礼。
