    Integration of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    By the end of last year, the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region had raised more than 900,000 head of livestock of various kinds (excluding draught animals), an increase of 13.18% compared with the period of the First Five-Year Plan.
    In the past, animal husbandry was mostly concentrated in raising livestock. Last year, a large number of herds were transferred to production teams, further strengthening the relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry, providing fertilizer sources for farmland and fodder for livestock.

    农牧业结合
    新疆军区生产建设兵团截至去年年底，共养育各种牲畜九十多万头（不包括役畜），增长率较第一个五年计划期间提高13.18％。
    过去，畜牧业多半是集中饲养，去年把大量畜群下放到生产队，进一步密切了农牧业之间的关系，使农田有肥源，牲畜有饲草。
