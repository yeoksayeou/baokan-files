    On the Industrial Army

    The "Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China states: "Large-scale agricultural production teams, like large-scale industrial production teams, are an industrial army." What is an industrial army? Where did this term come from? Industry originally referred to modern large-scale industry. The industrial army refers to the masses of workers in these modern large-scale industries who are organized like an army by capitalists, cruelly exploited by capitalists, and produce surplus value for capitalists. On this point, the "Bourgeois and Proletarians" section of the Communist Manifesto writes: "The mass of laborers, crowded into the factory, is organized like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants." Marx, in "Das Kapital," often refers to employed workers as the "active labor army," unemployed workers as the "industrial reserve army," ordinary workers as "ordinary industrial soldiers," and "labor supervisors" as "junior officers of the industrial army." Because this industrial army was formed after the bourgeois revolution, the "Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning People's Communes" states: "The modern industrial army is organized by the bourgeoisie."

    In socialist countries where capitalist ownership has been eliminated, the working class is still an industrial army, but it is fundamentally different from the industrial army under the capitalist system. Under the capitalist system, the proletarians who make up the industrial army are slaves of capital; under the socialist system, the working class that makes up the industrial army are masters of the country.

    After overthrowing capitalism, with the socialist transformation of agriculture, with individual peasants becoming agricultural cooperatives, especially the farmers of the people's communes, and with small-scale production becoming large-scale production, it is also necessary to organize an industrial army in agriculture like in industry. In the "Proletarians and Communists" section of the Communist Manifesto, when discussing the measures that the proletariat should take after seizing power and eliminating capital, one of the measures is to organize an agricultural industrial army. This measure is: "Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture." The militarized organization, combat-ready action, collectivized living, and democratized management implemented in our rural areas after communization is the application of democratic centralism in the industrial industrial army of socialist society in agriculture.

    What we call militarized organization and agricultural industrial army, of course, does not mean that the people's commune is a military barracks and the commune members are soldiers; it means that the development of agricultural production requires people to work in a more organized and disciplined manner, and therefore more efficiently, like factory workers or soldiers. The agricultural industrial army, like the industrial industrial army, is an organized and disciplined team engaged in production.

    It is foreseeable that with the industrialization of communes, the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and with the gradual disappearance of the differences between workers and peasants, the differences between urban and rural areas, and the differences between mental and manual labor, the boundaries between the industrial industrial army and the agricultural industrial army will gradually disappear, and a national industrial army that includes both industry and agriculture will be formed. At that time, we will enter the era of communism.

### 关于产业军

专栏：名词解释

    关于产业军
    中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中说：“大规模的农业生产队伍同大规模的工业生产队伍一样，是一支产业军”。什么是产业军呢？这个名称是怎么来的呢？产业，本来指的就是现代大工业。产业军就是指的在这些现代大工业中被资本家像军队一样组织起来、受资本家残酷剥削、为资本家生产剩余价值的工人群众。关于这一点，共产党宣言的“资产者与无产者”一节写道：“拥挤在工厂里面的工人群众就像兵士一般被编制起来。他们是工业军的普通兵卒，受着整批军士和军官的层层监视。”马克思在“资本论”一书中常常把在业的工人称为“现役劳动军”把失业工人称为“产业后备军”，把一般工人称为“普通的产业兵”，把“劳动监督者”称为“产业军的下级士官”。由于这支产业军是在资产阶级革命以后形成的，因此，“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中说：“近代产业军，是资产阶级组织的。”
    在消灭了资本主义所有制的社会主义国家中，工人阶级当然还是一支产业军，不过它同资本主义制度下的产业军已经根本不同。在资本主义制度下，组成产业军的无产者是资本的奴隶，在社会主义制度下，组成产业军的工人阶级则是国家的主人了。
    在推翻资本主义以后，随着对农业的社会主义改造，随着个体农民变成农业合作社，特别是人民公社的农民，随着小生产变为大生产，农业中也有必要组织像工业中一样的产业军。“共产党宣言”的“无产者与共产党人”一节中，在谈到无产阶级夺取了政权、消灭了资本，应该采取的办法中有一项办法就是组织农业产业军，这项办法是：“实行普遍劳动义务制，成立产业军，特别是在农业方面”。我国农村在公社化以后实行的组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化，就是社会主义社会工业产业军中的民主集中制在农业中的运用。
    我们所谓的组织军事化和农业产业军，当然不是说人民公社就是部队的兵营，公社的社员就是部队的战士；而是说农业生产的发展，要求人们劳动得更有组织，更有纪律，因而更有效率，就像工厂的工人那样，或者部队的战士那样，农业产业军和工业产业军一样，是一支有组织有纪律地进行生产的队伍。
    可以预料，随着公社工业化、农业机械化、电气化，随着工农差别，城乡差别，脑力劳动和体力劳动差别的逐步消失，工业产业军和农业产业军的界限也将逐步消失，全国将形成一支既包括了工业也包括了农业的全民产业军，那时，也就进入共产主义的时代了。
