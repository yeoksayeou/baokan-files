Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's policy address at the 31st regular session of the Japanese Diet on the 27th demonstrated that the Kishi Nobusuke government is determined to tie Japan even more tightly to the American chariot, accelerate its expansion into Southeast Asia, and further strengthen its fascist rule domestically. This speech has already been strongly condemned by Socialist Party legislators.

In his policy address, Kishi Nobusuke attacked the urgent demands of various sectors of the Japanese people for Japan to take the path of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality, and emphasized strengthening Japanese-American military collusion.

When discussing the signing of an aggressive military bilateral treaty between Japan and the United States in his policy address, Kishi Nobusuke attempted to exploit the Japanese people's desire for independence, using the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and "clarifying the obligations and responsibilities of Japan and the United States as equal partners" as pretexts to sign an aggressive military bilateral treaty with the United States. However, this trick of deceiving the people has long been seen through. Therefore, according to Kyodo News, "Opposition (legislators) frequently made mocking sounds during Kishi Nobusuke's speech, and generally speaking, the (Kishi Nobusuke) speech proceeded in a low-key manner."

In his speech, Kishi Nobusuke once again revealed his desire for the Southeast Asian market and for economic expansion, and stated that he would further promote reactionary politics domestically.

On the 27th, Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki questioned Kishi Nobusuke's policy address at a session of the Japanese Diet. Suzuki pointed out that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" carries the danger of involving Japan in a chain reaction with the U.S., Philippines, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee military alliance treaties. Therefore, the Socialist Party demands the abolition of the "Security Treaty" and the cessation of negotiations to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He demanded that Kishi Nobusuke, in the current international situation, re-examine Japan's diplomatic course. Suzuki also investigated the Kishi Nobusuke government's responsibility for its failures in both domestic and foreign affairs, and demanded the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma of the Japanese Socialist Party also condemned Kishi Nobusuke's policy address. Asanuma pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party is a class party representing the monopoly capitalist group, and it is intolerable that it is retaliating against the opposition Socialist Party. Asanuma pointed out that although Kishi Nobusuke says he wants to pursue peaceful diplomacy, he admits military alliances and criticizes neutral diplomacy, which can be said to be taking the road to war.

Japanese Socialist Party legislator Tadayuki Sata questioned Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's policy address at a plenary session of the House of Councillors on the 28th. He said that Japan does not need American troops stationed in Japan, whether for handling domestic turmoil or resisting aggression. He also pointed out that Japan should emphasize the prohibition of nuclear armament and the demarcation of nuclear-free zones. In addition, it is necessary to conclude non-aggression treaties with neighboring countries and establish a peace system including Korea, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Sata believes that these things cannot be achieved without abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

In his questioning, Sata condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for adopting a hostile policy toward China and hindering the normalization of Japan-China relations. He believes that the will of the Japanese people is for Japan and China to coexist peacefully, not interfere in each other's internal affairs, not recognize "two Chinas," and restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.

In response to Tadayuki Sata's questioning, Kishi Nobusuke blatantly disregarded the Japanese people's desire for peace and independence, and he actually said, "It is only natural to revise the security treaty into an 'equal and autonomous' treaty." He also deceitfully said, "I have not considered using this revision (of the security treaty) to implement nuclear armament in our country and bring about the danger of involving Japan in war." When answering the questioning, Kishi Nobusuke further exposed his anti-peaceful face, saying, "The Socialist Party says it wants to establish a collective security system including both the Eastern and Western camps, which is a statement divorced from reality."

Regarding the issue of hostility towards China, Kishi Nobusuke, intimidated by the strong opposition of the Japanese people, only wanted to get by vaguely and did not answer Sata's questioning directly. At this time, a burst of boos resounded from the seats of the opposition legislators.

    岸信介坚持走军国主义道路
    日本社会党议员抨击政府反动政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本首相岸信介27日在日本第三十一次平时国会会议上发表的施政演说表明，岸信介政府决心把日本更紧地绑在美国战车上，加紧向东南亚地区进行扩张，同时进一步加强国内的法西斯统治。这个演说，已经受到了社会党议员的强烈谴责。
    岸信介在施政演说中攻击了日本各阶层人民希望日本走和平、独立、民主、中立道路的迫切要求，强调加强日美军事勾结。
    岸信介在施政演说中谈到日本同美国签订侵略性的军事双边协定时，企图利用日本人民渴望独立的心情，以修改日美“安全条约”、
  “明确日美两国作为平等的合作者的义务和责任”为口实，同美国签订侵略性的军事双边协定。但是这一套欺骗人民的手法早已被识破，因此据共同社报道，“在野党（议员）对岸信介的演说不时发出嘲笑声，一般地说，（岸信介）演说的情况是低沉的”。
    在演说中，岸信介再一次暴露出他垂涎于东南亚市场和进行经济扩张的野心，并且表示要在国内进一步推行反动政治。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎27日在日本国会会议上就岸信介的施政演说进行了质询。铃木指出，修改日美“安全条约”，有把日本连锁反应式地卷进美、菲、蒋、李军事同盟条约的危险。因此，社会党要求废除“安全条约”，并且停止进行修改日美“安全条约”的谈判。他要求岸信介在目前的国际形势下，要重新研究日本的外交路线。铃木还追究了岸信介政府在内政外交上到处失败的责任，并且要求岸信介内阁辞职。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎也谴责了岸信介的施政演说。浅沼指出，自由民主党是代表垄断资本集团的阶级政党，它竟然对反对党社会党进行报复，这是不能容忍的。浅沼指出，岸信介虽然嘴上说要进行和平外交，但是承认军事同盟，批评中立外交，这可以说是正在走着通向战争的道路。
    日本社会党议员佐多忠隆在28日的参议院全体会议上就岸信介首相施政演说进行质询。他说，日本无论是为了处理内乱，或者是抵御侵略，都不需要美国军队驻在日本。他还指出，日本应该强调禁止核武装、划定禁止核武装地带。另外，还有必要同邻近各国缔结互不侵犯条约，并且建立包括朝鲜、中国、苏联、美国在内的和平体系。佐多认为不废除日美“安全条约”就作不到这些事情。
    佐多在质询中谴责了岸信介政府对中国采取敌视政策和阻碍日中关系正常化。他认为日本人民的意志是要日中两国和平共处；互不干涉内政；不承认“两个中国”，并且要恢复日中邦交。
    岸信介在回答佐多忠隆的质询时，公然无视日本人民要求和平独立的意志，他竟说，“把安全条约改订成为一个‘平等而自主’的条约，这是理所当然的”。他还掩耳盗铃地说，“我没有考虑通过这次改订（安全条约）来使我国实行核武装，并且带来使日本卷进战争的危险”。岸信介在回答质询时，还进一步暴露了他反对和平的嘴脸，他说，“社会党说要建立包括东西方两阵营在内的集体安全体系，那是脱离现实的论调”。
    关于敌视中国的问题，岸信介慑于日本人民的强烈反对，他只是想含糊过关，没有正面回答佐多的质询。这时，从在野党议员的席位上响起了一阵嘘声。
