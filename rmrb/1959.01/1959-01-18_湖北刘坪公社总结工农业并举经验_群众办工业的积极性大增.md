Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 17th: The Liuping People's Commune in Changyang County, Hubei Province, through studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and summarizing the experiences of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture in 1958, has further inspired the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for running industry. This commune established 199 factories last year, including iron plants, farm tool factories, indigenous fertilizer plants, wineries, and sugar mills. This year, they plan to establish industrial units such as coal mines, copper mines, lime factories, and sulfur mines.

Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, the Liuping People's Commune achieved an all-round bumper harvest and a substantial increase in income last year. The total grain output of the commune reached more than 46.5 million jin, transforming it from a grain-deficient commune into a grain-surplus commune. The total output value of industry and agriculture (including sideline occupations) increased by 2.64 times compared with 1957.

Through summarization, everyone unanimously believed that as long as politics takes command and leadership division of labor and labor allocation are well-arranged, the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture is possible and necessary. In 1958, this commune developed from almost no factories before the establishment of the commune to 199 factories, while grain production and diversified operations still achieved a bumper harvest, which is a good proof. Everyone believed that running industry with the principle of using local materials and mainly serving agriculture effectively supported agricultural production. From factories producing daily necessities, commune members obtained a large supply of wine, sugar, miscellaneous sugar, flour, tea, toilet paper, etc. These products were also sold to the state, supporting national construction.

In solving the problems of funds and technology in running industry, they also gained experience in 1958. When the commune started running industry last year, the funds raised by cadres and the masses were only more than 2,000 yuan. However, based on the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, they only spent 24 yuan to build a granular fertilizer plant last year. After the experience of running factories diligently and thriftily was promoted, various factories were established like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The commune solved the technical problems of iron and steel, sugar making, and granular fertilizer plants by inviting masters from other places and sending people to study in other places. In steelmaking, 278 farmers in the commune have mastered relatively complex technologies.

    湖北刘坪公社总结工农业并举经验
    群众办工业的积极性大增
    据新华社武汉17日电　湖北长阳县刘坪人民公社通过学习党的八届六中全会文件和总结1958年工农业并举的经验，进一步鼓舞了干部和群众办工业的积极性。这个公社去年办起铁厂、农具厂、土化肥厂、酒厂、糖厂等一百九十九个，今年他们还要建立煤矿、铜矿、石灰厂、硫磺矿等工业单位。
    由于认真贯彻工业与农业并举的方针，刘坪人民公社去年获得了全面丰产，收入大增。全公社去年粮食总产量达到四千六百五十多万斤，由历年缺粮社一跃而为余粮社；工业、农业（包括副业）的总产值比1957年增长二点六四倍。
    通过总结，大家一致认为只要政治挂帅、领导分工和劳力安排得好，工农业并举是可能和必需的。1958年这个公社由建社前几乎没有工厂发展到一百九十九个工厂，而粮食生产和多种经营仍然获得丰收，这就是很好的证明。大家认为，办工业采取就地取材、主要为农业服务的方针，还有力地支援了农业生产。从生产日常生活用品的工厂里，社员得到了大量的酒、食糖、杂糖、面粉、茶叶、卫生纸等的供应；这些产品同时也出售给国家，支援了国家建设。
    在办工业解决资金和技术的问题上，1958年他们也取得了经验。公社去年开始办工业时，干部和群众的集资只有两千多元。但是，他们根据勤俭办一切事业的精神，去年办一个颗粒肥料厂只花了二十四元。勤俭办工厂的经验加以推广以后，各种工厂就如雨后春笋般地建立起来。公社通过从外地请师傅和派人到外地学习的办法，解决了钢铁、制糖、颗粒肥料等厂的技术力量问题。在办钢铁中，全社已有二百七十八个农民掌握了比较复杂的技术。
