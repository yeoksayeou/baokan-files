Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th: The Dajiao People's Commune in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, is mobilizing the masses to summarize the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 during the commune rectification process. Through this summarization, the commune members have further clarified the superiority of the people's commune, and their confidence in striving for an all-round Great Leap Forward in production this year has been greatly enhanced.

When summarizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, all commune members participated, and each team conducted its own summary. Everyone believes that the commune has fully demonstrated its enormous superiority in just three months since its establishment. Last year, when the nationwide steelmaking and iron smelting campaign was launched, it coincided with the busy autumn harvest season. However, thanks to the large number of people and great strength of the commune, the total grain output of the entire commune still increased by nearly double compared to 1957, and the task of smelting 600 tons of iron was completed. At the same time, in accordance with the principle of combining industry and agriculture, the commune established fifteen large factories. In terms of farmland water conservancy and various basic construction projects: a new canal was opened, expanding the area of clear water fields by 10,000 mu; 27,000 mu of trees were planted; in order to support the "iron and steel marshal ascending to the throne" and the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, three highways totaling thirty *hua li* in length were built; and a seventy-*li* long road from Dajiao to Shihe was excavated. The masses praised these enormous changes, saying: "Clear water rolls around the village, flowers and fruits fill the mountains and trees line the way, highways and roads are like spider webs, a myriad of new things bring about a great transformation."

On the basis of production development and increased income for commune members, the commune established more than thirty amateur political, cultural, and technical schools in 1958, rectified two middle schools, and established a wired broadcasting station, a cultural palace, forty clubs, three film projection teams, and a performing arts troupe, greatly enlivening the cultural life of the commune members. In addition, the commune also established 125 public canteens, 24 kindergartens, 12 shoe factories, and 20 sewing factories, liberating 2,557 women who were originally unable to directly participate in labor from tedious housework, enabling them to directly participate in productive labor. Commune members believe that all these achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the superiority of the people's commune. After the summary, the commune members proposed, "Strive for further advancement on the Leap Forward road, aiming for even greater heights this year." Currently, a vigorous commune rectification and winter production campaign has been universally launched throughout the commune.

    山西大交人民公社的豪语
    跃进路上再争先
    今年更上一层天
    据新华社太原17日电　山西省翼城县大交人民公社在整社中，发动群众总结1958年大跃进的成就。经过总结，社员们进一步看清了人民公社的优越性，力争今年各项生产全面大跃进的信心更加高涨。
    在总结1958年大跃进的成就时，公社社员人人参加，队队总结。大家认为：公社建立仅仅三个月，就充分显示出巨大的优越性。去年全民炼钢炼铁运动展开时，正值三秋大忙季节，但是由于公社人多力量大，仍然使全社粮食总产量比1957年增产将近一倍，并且完成炼铁六百吨的任务。与此同时，还根据工农业并举的方针，全社举办了十五个大工厂。在农田水利和各项基本建设方面：新开水渠一条，扩大清水地一万亩；植树二万七千亩；为了支援钢铁元帅升帐和农业生产大跃进，修建长达三十华里的公路三条；开凿大交到十河长达七十里的大路一条。群众歌颂这些巨大的变化是：“清水滚滚绕村庄，花果满山树成行，公路大路如蛛网，万象更新大变样。”
    在生产发展和社员收入增加的基础上，公社在1958年建立了三十多座业余政治文化技术学校，整顿了两所中学，建立了一座有线广播站、一座文化宫、四十个俱乐部、三个电影队和一个文工团，大大活跃了社员群众的文化生活。此外，全社还办起了一百二十五个公共食堂，二十四个幼儿园，十二个制鞋厂，二十个缝纫厂，使原来不能直接参加劳动的二千五百五十七个妇女，从烦琐的家务劳动中解放出来，直接参加了生产劳动。社员们认为：所有这些成就的获得，都是和党的领导及人民公社的优越性分不开的。经过总结后，社员们纷纷提出“跃进路上再争先，今年更上一层天。”目前，一个轰轰烈烈的整社和冬季生产运动已在全社普遍展开。
