    Always Maintain Soaring Enthusiasm
    Be Reliable, But More Importantly, Be Proactive
    Currently, on all fronts including industry, agriculture, culture, education, science, and health, the vast numbers of cadres and the masses are further increasing their enthusiasm, determined to make new and great achievements in 1959, so that our socialist construction undertaking can develop faster, better, and more economically. This proactive thinking is the correct thinking that holds a dominant position; it is the mainstream of the masses' thinking at present. However, there are also some people who have a mood of relaxation and conservative thoughts. They only one-sidedly emphasize that plans should be fully reliable, while lacking a proactive spirit. This mood of relaxation and conservative thinking are interconnected, and we must be vigilant and prevent them.
    We have repeatedly emphasized that our plans must not only be full of enthusiasm, ensuring the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1959, but also be based on a fully reliable foundation. Be reliable, and be proactive, that is our slogan. This slogan correctly reflects the objective dialectical relationship in the process of formulating the Great Leap Forward plan. The aspect of reliability and the aspect of proactivity are both indispensable. Regarding the current actual situation, we especially should not deviate from the proactive spirit and one-sidedly talk about the reliability of the plan. It must be admitted that under the same basic conditions, the results obtained with a proactive spirit will definitely be much greater than the results obtained with a passive and relaxed attitude. It is precisely for this reason that in the process of formulating plans, we must combine proactivity and reliability, that is, the spirit of full enthusiasm and seeking truth from facts. First, there must be a goal of comprehensive leap forward, and under this goal, requiring the plan to have a fully reliable basis is meaningful. If we look at the problem one-sidedly and the plan drawn up has no leap forward at all, then it is not the comprehensive leap forward plan we require, but a completely conservative plan.
    Everyone has seen from the discussion of the plan that our subjective and objective conditions are particularly favorable for implementing the comprehensive leap forward plan. Our socialist economic foundation is now stronger and more consolidated than in any previous year. Our means of industrial and agricultural production are much more abundant this year than in previous years. Last year's Great Leap Forward not only opened up the path for a comprehensive leap forward in the future, but also taught us many new skills and accumulated many experiences that we did not have before. We now have a large number of advanced producers and new types of cultural, scientific, and technical personnel that we lacked in the past. It is certain that in the future socialist construction, it will be fully possible to overcome the difficulties that were difficult to overcome in the past.
    Our national plan is complete; the whole country can only have one chessboard, and the whole city can only have one chessboard, and there cannot be several chessboards. Whether it is a county, district, enterprise, or commune, the plans of all parts must be subordinate to the overall plan and should be incorporated into the overall plan. The city's plan must also be subordinate to the national plan and incorporated into the national plan. Here, no decentralism or departmentalism is allowed. The enthusiasm of the localities must be cherished, but this enthusiasm must be unified with the overall plan. (Excerpt from the "Frontline" editorial in the second issue of 1959: "Be Reliable and Be Proactive")

    Enthusiasm is the Decisive Factor for the Leap Forward
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, the soaring enthusiasm displayed by the people of the province and the vast numbers of cadres was the decisive factor for the leap forward, and will continue to be the decisive factor in the future. The people's full enthusiasm is the treasure of treasures. Everything needs to be done by people, and a bigger leap forward plan will not be realized if no one does it. Practice has proven that people are the most active factor in production, and people's subjective initiative can transform bad into good and difficulties into smoothness under certain conditions. Therefore, we must cherish the enthusiasm of the people, protect enthusiasm, and continue to boost revolutionary enthusiasm. Of course, what we mean by promoting revolutionary enthusiasm is not denying the role of objective conditions, let alone advocating looking at problems subjectively. On the contrary, we advocate actively striving for the realization of the leap forward task within the limits of objective possibilities.
    The practice of 1958 proves that constantly opposing conservative thinking, breaking superstitions, and liberating the mind have guaranteed continuous leap forwards. In the future, we must continue to oppose conservative thinking. In the rapidly changing situation of the leap forward, people's thinking often lags behind reality, and conservative thinking will always be the main obstacle to progress. We must adhere to the struggle against all kinds of conservative thinking and be vigilant against the rise of new conservative thinking. At the same time, in order to continuously achieve victories, we must continue to break superstitions and continue to liberate the mind. Superstition is a rigid thought that lags far behind objective reality. Therefore, it hinders the emergence of new things and restrains the development of productive forces. Advocating the liberation of the mind is advocating a correct understanding of objective reality. Constantly liberating the mind is constantly recognizing the development of objective reality and grasping its laws. In particular, the leap forward situation is a rapidly changing situation, and people's thinking will be left behind by history if it stagnates even slightly. Only by constantly liberating the mind and breaking superstitions can our thinking keep up with the situation of the leap forward. Of course, liberating the mind is by no means empty thinking divorced from objective reality, and breaking superstitions must never break science. The liberation of the mind must and should be combined with seeking truth from facts, and breaking superstitions must be combined with respecting science, and the two must be unified in practice.
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, the ambition of everyone striving to be upstream and everyone being a promoter was promoted, and revolutionary friendship competitions were launched, which played a significant role in promoting the socialist construction cause. The method of revolutionary friendship competition is conducive to promoting the backward to catch up with the advanced, and conducive to making the advanced even more advanced, thereby promoting overall progress. This is a valuable experience in organizing the Great Leap Forward and must continue to be promoted. The working method of the mass line has been greatly developed in last year's Great Leap Forward, and has powerfully promoted the production movement. On-site meetings, inspection and evaluation, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, etc., are all our "magic weapons" for leading the masses to engage in the Great Leap Forward, which should not only be continued to be used, but also should be developed in practice.
    From this point of view, we not only have many favorable conditions, but also have rich experience, and it is entirely possible to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. (Excerpt from the Yunnan Daily editorial on January 14, "Sum Up Experience and Strive for Greater Victory in 1959")

    Constantly Boosting Enthusiasm in Practice
    In 1958, in the early stages of striving for a great agricultural harvest and a great steel leap forward, most people had great enthusiasm, but at the beginning they had not fully grasped the laws of the leap forward. A few people lacked enthusiasm, one-sidedly emphasizing the difficulties of objective conditions while neglecting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. The rectification movement repeatedly criticized this right-leaning conservative thinking. The victory of the early rice harvest and the victory of the whole people running steel factories used facts to break superstitions and liberate the mind, making people realize that revolutionary enthusiasm can greatly accelerate the development of industrial and agricultural production, and the subjective initiative of the people is a great driving force. People's realization of this point is a great improvement. With the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, people's revolutionary enthusiasm is getting greater and greater, and their experience is also getting more and more abundant. People's revolutionary enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis, and people's subjective initiative must be combined with respecting objective laws. This is the process of people constantly boosting enthusiasm and seeking laws in practice. The Great Leap Forward is a great revolutionary pioneering work unprecedented in history. People lack experience, and in the early stages of practice, it is inevitable that they will temporarily fail to correctly recognize objective laws and fall into such or such one-sidedness. The repetition of practice, the more fully the objective process is exposed, the more people's understanding will deepen from shallow to deep, from one-sided to more aspects, and the ability to understand will also be improved. It is incorrect to think that people can avoid making any errors, large or small, in cognition, and can completely avoid the twists and turns and repetitions in the cognitive process. Of course, it is also completely wrong to think that the development of people's understanding is only a repeated cycle of right and wrong, and cannot gradually improve their understanding, correct errors, and achieve a correct understanding of objective laws in the process of practice. What plays a decisive role here is people's revolutionary enthusiasm and thinking methods. Objective laws reflect the objective process that does not shift with people's will, but people can discover, recognize, and use objective laws to serve themselves. We communists and working people always put revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific analysis in the first place. Because people have great enthusiasm, few superstitions, and scientific analysis, it is relatively easy to discover, recognize, and act according to objective laws in the process of repeated practice. Conversely, if people lack enthusiasm, have many superstitions, and dare not boldly conduct experiments (practice), or are afraid of dragons and tigers in practice, then how can they talk about discovering, recognizing, and mastering objective laws? We believe that if we continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, do practical work diligently, painstakingly, and skillfully, we will definitely be able to win a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959! (Excerpt from the "Seeking Truth" editorial in the first issue of 1959: "Combine Revolutionary Enthusiasm with Scientific Analysis")

    Overcome Difficulties and Strive for a Greater Leap Forward
    Those of us who are engaged in revolution and construction, who want to transform the old world and build a new society, and who want to do magnificent undertakings that our predecessors have never done before, will always encounter various difficulties. In fact, every victory we have achieved in our revolutionary struggle, and every progress we have made in our revolutionary struggle, has crossed over difficulties, large or small. It can be said that the bigger our leap forward is, the more difficulties we encounter, and the greater the victory we achieve after overcoming the difficulties. Our Party has rich experience in correctly treating difficulties and overcoming difficulties. This is concentratedly manifested in the guiding ideology of Chairman Mao's proposal to despise difficulties strategically and value difficulties tactically. If we want to make a great leap forward, we must have the great revolutionary spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," and regard the greatest difficulties as paper tigers. This revolutionary spirit is very important. Because to carry out any work, it is first of all necessary to have confidence and determination. If there is right-leaning conservative thinking, and one starts with a lack of confidence and determination, and is confused by some temporary phenomena, and one first disarms oneself spiritually, then naturally there is no way to talk about overcoming difficulties, let alone persisting to the final victory on the path of tortuous progress.
    Of course, our despising difficulties and having confidence and determination to achieve victory is not "blind optimism" without basis, but is based on a profound understanding of the laws of development of objective things. Dialectical materialism tells us that social productive forces are bound to develop forward, and that new things that represent the requirements of developing productive forces, although they may look weaker temporarily, have strong vitality, and they will continue to break through the difficulties on the road forward, grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and grow healthily. At the same time, difficulty and smoothness are the unity of opposites, and gradually transform into their opposites under certain conditions. Therefore, difficulty itself contains the factors to overcome itself, and where there is difficulty, there will inevitably be a way to overcome the difficulty. In our socialist construction cause, favorable conditions always occupy a dominant position, and difficulties and unfavorable conditions are temporary. As long as we carry out serious scientific analysis, we will be able to establish a strong confidence and determination to overcome difficulties.
    Difficulty is a bad thing and also a good thing. Of course, it is better to have no difficulty than to have difficulty, but when a difficulty appears, it exposes a contradiction, attracts people's attention, and tries to overcome it, making production and work take a step forward, and the difficulty becomes a driving force for progress. We must follow the instructions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, on the one hand, we must continue to oppose conservatism, break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and go all out, striving for upstream; at the same time, we must do practical work diligently, painstakingly, and skillfully, "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures," so that economic work becomes more and more meticulous, as close as possible to or in line with reality.

### 永远要保持冲天的干劲

    永远要保持冲天的干劲
    既要可靠　更要积极
    现在无论在工业、农业、文化、教育、科学、卫生等各个战线上，广大的干部和群众都进一步鼓足了干劲，要在1959年做出新的伟大成绩，使我们的社会主义建设事业更加多快好省地向前发展。这种积极的思想是居于主导地位的正确思想，这是目前群众思想的主流。但是也有一些人有松劲的情绪和保守的思想。他们只片面地强调计划要充分可靠，而缺乏积极的精神。这种松劲情绪和保守思想是一脉相通的，我们必须加以警惕和防止。
    我们曾经反复多次地强调说，我们的计划既要鼓足干劲，保证1959年的全面大跃进，又要把计划建立在充分可靠的基础上。既要可靠，又要积极，这就是我们的口号。这个口号正确地反映了大跃进计划制订过程的客观辩证关系。可靠性的一面和积极性的一面是不可偏废的。对于当前的实际情况来说，我们尤其不应该离开积极的精神，片面地谈论计划的可靠程度。必须承认，在基础和条件相同的情况下，用积极精神所得的结果一定要比消极松劲所得的结果大得多。正是因为这个原故，所以我们在制订计划的过程中，一定要把积极性和可靠性，即鼓足干劲和实事求是的精神结合起来。首先要有全面跃进的目标，在这个目标之下要求计划有充分可靠的根据，才是有意义的。如果片面地看问题，订出的计划根本没有什么跃进，那就不是我们所要求的全面跃进的计划，而是十足保守的计划了。
    大家从讨论计划的过程中已经看到，现在我们的主观条件和客观条件，对于实行全面跃进的计划，是特别有利的。我们的社会主义经济基础，现在比过去任何一年都更加强大和巩固了，我们的工农业生产资料，今年比往年充足得多了；去年的大跃进不但给我们打开了今后全面跃进的道路，并且使我们学会了许多新的本领，积累了许多以前没有的经验；我们现在拥有大批过去所缺少的先进生产者和新型的文化科学技术人员；在今后的社会主义建设中将有充分可能克服过去难于克服的困难，这是可以肯定的。
    我们的国家计划是完整的，全国只能有一盘棋，全市也只能有一盘棋，而不能有几盘棋。无论是一个县区、一个企业、一个公社，各个部分的计划都要服从于整体的计划，都应该纳入整体的计划；全市的计划也必须服从全国的计划，纳入全国的计划中去。在这里，不允许闹分散主义和本位主义。地方的积极性必须加以爱护，但是这种积极性又必须与整体计划统一起来。（摘自“前线”1959年第二期社论：“既要可靠，又要积极”）
    干劲是跃进的决定因素
    在去年的大跃进中，全省人民和广大干部所发扬起来的冲天干劲，是跃进的决定性因素，今后仍然是决定性因素。人民群众的十足干劲，是宝中之宝。一切事情都是要人做的，更大的跃进计划没有人做就不会实现。实践证明：人是生产中最活跃的因素，人的主观能动性在一定条件下能够使坏转化为好、使困难转化为顺利。所以，我们必须十分珍惜人民群众的干劲、爱护干劲，继续鼓足革命干劲。当然，我们所指的发扬革命干劲，并不是否认客观条件的作用，更不是主张主观地看问题。恰恰相反，我们主张在客观可能性的限度之内，能动地争取跃进任务的实现。
    1958年的实践证明：不断地反对保守思想，破除迷信，解放思想，保证了不断地跃进。今后，我们必须继续反对保守思想。在一日千里的跃进形势下，人们的思想往往落后于实际，保守思想将永远是前进的主要障碍。我们必须坚持和形形色色的保守思想作斗争，并警惕新的保守思想的抬头。同时，为了不断取得胜利，还必须继续破除迷信，继续解放思想。迷信是一种僵化了的思想，它远远落在客观实际后面。因而它障碍着新生事物的发生，束缚着生产力的发展。提倡思想解放，就是主张正确认识客观实际。不断地解放思想，就是不断地认识客观实际的发展，并掌握其规律。特别是，跃进的形势是急剧变化的形势，人们的思想稍一停滞，就会被历史抛在后面。只有不断地解放思想，破除迷信，才能使我们的思想跟得上跃进的形势。当然，解放思想，决不是脱离客观实际的空想，破除迷信，也决不能破除科学。解放思想必须也应当和实事求是结合，破除迷信必须与尊重科学结合，并在实践中把两者统一起来。
    在去年的大跃进中，发扬了人人争上游、个个当促进派的志气，开展了革命的友谊竞赛，对于社会主义建设事业，起了显著的推动作用。革命友谊竞赛的方法，有利于促进落后赶上先进，有利于使先进的再先进，从而推动整体前进。这是组织大跃进的一条宝贵经验，必须继续加以发扬。群众路线的工作方法，在去年的大跃进中，得到了很大发展、有力地推动了生产运动。现场会议、检查评比、抓两头带中间等等，都是我们领导群众搞大跃进的“法宝”，不但要继续运用，而且应当在实践中加以发展。
    从此看来，我们不但有许多有利的条件，而且有丰富的经验，完全可能实现更大更好更全面的跃进。（摘自云南日报1月14日社论“总结经验，争取1959年的更大胜利”）
    在实践中不断的鼓干劲
    1958年，在争取农业大丰收和钢铁大跃进的初期，多数人干劲很大，但是一开始还没有完全摸到跃进的规律。少数人则干劲不足，片面强调客观条件的困难，而忽视人的革命干劲。整风运动反复地批判了这种右倾保守思想。早稻大丰收的胜利，全民办钢铁的胜利，用事实破除了迷信，解放了思想，使人们认识到：革命干劲能够大大加速工农业生产的发展，人民群众的主观能动性是一个伟大的动力。人们认识到这一点，是一个很大的提高。随着工农业生产的继续跃进，人们的革命干劲越来越大，经验也越来越多了。人的革命干劲必须和科学分析相结合，人的主观能动性必须和尊重客观规律相结合。这是人们在实践中不断地鼓干劲、求规律的过程。大跃进是前无古人的伟大的革命创举，人们缺乏经验，在实践的开始阶段，暂时不能够正确地认识客观规律，陷于这样或那样的片面性，是难免的。实践的反复，客观过程暴露得越来越充分，人们的认识就会由浅入深，由片面到更多的方面，而认识能力也越来越提高了。认为人们能够在认识上可以不犯任何或大或小的错误，能够完全避免认识过程中的曲折和反复，这是不正确的。当然，认为人们的认识发展只不过是正确和错误的反复循环，而不能够在实践过程中逐步地提高认识，修正错误，达到对于客观规律的正确认识，这也是完全错误的。在这里，起决定作用的是人的革命干劲和思想方法。客观规律是反映着不以人们意志为转移的客观过程，但是人们能够发现，认识客观规律和运用客观规律为自己服务。我们共产党人和劳动人民，总是把革命干劲和科学分析放在心目中的首位。因为人们干劲大，迷信少，加上科学分析，在反复实践的过程中就比较容易发现、认识客观规律和按照客观规律办事。反之，人们如果干劲不足，迷信甚多，不敢大胆进行试验（实践），或者在实践中前怕龙、后怕虎，那末，怎么能够谈得上发现、认识和掌握客观规律呢？我们相信：继续反对保守，破除迷信，实干苦干巧干，我们一定能够赢得1959年更大更好更全面的跃进！（摘自“求是”1959年第一期社论：“把革命干劲和科学分析结合起来”）
    战胜困难　力争更大跃进
    我们从事革命和建设事业的人，要改造旧世界，建设新社会，做前人所没做过的宏伟事业，总是会碰到各种各样的困难的。事实上，我们革命斗争中取得的每一个胜利，我们革命斗争中取得的每一点进展，都曾跨过或大或小的困难。可以说，我们跃进越大，遇到的困难也越多，克服困难以后取得的胜利也越大。我们党对于正确地对待困难和战胜困难，是有着丰富的经验的。这集中地表现为毛主席提出的在战略上要藐视困难，在战术上要重视困难的指导思想。我们要大跃进，就要有叫“高山低头，河水让路”的伟大的革命气魄，天大的困难也要看做是纸老虎，不在话下。这种革命的气魄是十分重要的。因为进行任何工作，都首先要求有信心有决心，如果存有右倾保守思想，一上来就信心不足，决心不大，被一些暂时的现象所迷惑，自己先在精神上解除了武装，自然就谈不上战胜困难，更无法在曲折前进的道路上，坚持到最终的胜利。
    当然，我们藐视困难，有信心有决心取得胜利，并不是没有根据的“盲目乐观”，而是根据对客观事物发展规律的深刻理解。辩证唯物主义告诉我们，社会生产力是必然向前发展的，代表发展生产力要求的新生事物，尽管暂时看起来还弱小一些，但是它具有强大的生命力，它会不断地突破前进道路上的困难，由小到大，由弱到强，茁壮成长起来。同时，困难和顺利是对立面的统一，在一定的条件下逐步各向其反面转化，因而困难本身就包含着克服它自己的因素，有困难就必然会找到克服困难的办法。在我们的社会主义建设事业中，有利条件总是占统治的地位，困难和不利条件都是暂时的，只要我们认真进行科学的分析，我们就能够树立起坚强的战胜困难的信心和决心。
    困难是坏事也是好事。有困难当然不如没有困难好，但一个困难出现了，暴露了一个矛盾，引起人们的注意，设法战胜了它，使生产、工作推进一步，困难又变成了前进的动力。我们必须遵照党的六中全会的指示，一方面要继续反对保守，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢干，鼓足干劲，力争上游；同时要实干苦干巧干，“十分指标，十二分措施”，使经济工作愈做愈细致，尽可能地接近或者符合实际。（摘自天津日报1959年1月25日社论：“鼓足干劲大闹技术革命力争更大跃进”）
