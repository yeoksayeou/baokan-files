To provide the people with rich spiritual food, the Soviet Union will publish a large number of books this year.

(From Our Newspaper) In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan towards communism, the Soviet Union will publish a large number of Marxist-Leninist theoretical works and political books on the history of the Soviet Communist Party and communist education. The Soviet National Literature Publishing House will publish more than 600 literary works, totaling over 80 million copies. The Soviet Foreign Literature Publishing House plans to publish more than 100 literary works from 46 countries.

In terms of political theory books, in addition to continuing the publication of the complete works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, the Soviet Union will also reprint documents from previous Party congresses and publish "History of the Soviet Communist Party," "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," and Leontief's "Popular Course in Political Economy." Regarding books on ideological education, the following will be published this year: "Lenin on Socialist Thought and Culture," Selected Works of Kalinin, Krupskaya's "Problems of Communist Education for Youth," and "Aesthetics," a collective work by philosophers. An important part of the Soviet political book publishing plan is books related to the 21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. The complete stenographic report of the December Plenum of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party (1958) has already been published. The "Seven-Year Plan" picture album with rich materials, a series of books on the achievements of Soviet agriculture in the past five years, and books against revisionism are about to meet readers.

The Soviet National Literature Publishing House plans to publish new selections of fourteen writers this year, concentrating on selections from Gogol, Pushkin, A. Ostrovsky, Fadeyev, Fedin, and other writers. Fadeyev's five-volume work will include his entire artistic legacy. In addition, it is expected that the publication of the "Soviet Prose Series," including the works of 150 writers, will begin at the end of this year, and this series will be completed in five or six years.

The Soviet Union's foreign literature publishing plan this year is also very large. Twenty or thirty novels by writers from socialist countries will be published, including: "Eyes of Wisdom," a novel reflecting the February Revolution of Czechoslovakia in 1948, "The Miracle Maker," a novel depicting the life of the German people in this century, and "The Sea" by Hungarian female writer Klara Feher. Literary works from other countries planned for publication include: "The Shoulder Patch," a novel by Belgian writer Daniel Gilles, which depicts the social life of Belgium during World War II and makes a ruthless exposure of the bourgeoisie; a work by French writer Andre Stil about the tragedy that occurred in Algeria; and "Youngblood," a novel by an American black writer depicting a black family in the American South, for which the famous singer Robeson will write the preface.

In order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, the Soviet Union plans to publish this year: "Marx, Engels, Lenin on China," the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, the reference book "Our Friend China," Zhou Libo's novel "Great Changes in a Mountain Village," Zhou Erfu's "Morning in Shanghai," Li Liuru's "Sixty Years of Change," and other works by Chinese writers.
