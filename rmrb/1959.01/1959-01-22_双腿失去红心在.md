Though Legs are Lost, the Red Heart Remains
    Yi Yi

This story is about Zhang Kelin, a 39-year-old Party branch committee member of the Longjiang Brigade, Chengmen People's Commune, Minhou County, Fujian. Twelve years ago, he lost both legs in the war. Afterwards, he spent several years in a disabled veterans' rehabilitation center. Last spring, the leadership approved his return to his hometown to participate in production.

This legless hero has always maintained a fiery red heart.

One morning last spring, the warm sunshine shone on the earth, and everything was painted with gold. Zhang Kelin carried a large shovel and went straight up Qingliang Mountain. In all the years since he had artificial legs, he had never walked such a rugged mountain road. Every step brought a burst of sweat. Before he had walked even a few dozen yards, his legs were sore and painful, and his underwear was soaked through. He sat down on the spot and pondered: Can these artificial legs of mine handle mountain roads? Of course, there are difficulties, but it is certainly possible. Difficulties can always be overcome by people. He remembered how he had lost his legs in the Battle of Jiawang that year, and how he practiced walking when he first got his artificial legs. At that time, he couldn't even stand, let alone walk! But wasn't he walking well now? Since there was no problem walking on flat ground, the difficulties of walking on mountain roads could not stop me either! Thinking of this, he suddenly stood up and continued forward. At this moment, he felt much stronger. When he reached the foot of the mountain, he looked up: This mountain is not low! He managed to walk along the edge of the mountain for a while, but the artificial legs below his knees could not bend uphill, so he crawled with both hands on the ground. However, five enemy bullets were still embedded in his left arm, making it two inches shorter than his right arm, so he couldn't support himself. So, he crawled sideways.... Crawl, crawl, his clothes were torn by thorns, his fingernails were filled with mud and grass, swollen and uncomfortable, but he didn't care at all. As he crawled, his head became dizzy. He sat on the hillside for a moment and glanced down: the green and yellow fields, like satin, and the Minjiang River beside the village, like a silver ribbon, and the beautiful peach blossoms in front of him.... What a beautiful landscape of his hometown! Zhang Kelin felt very broad-minded. He looked at the mountain again, a bare patch, and couldn't help but mutter to himself: Look, in a few years, I will make you a scene of peach blossoms, green willows, and fruit trees. He finished a bag of tobacco and lay on the ground again, crawling up the mountain with all his strength, finally reaching a sloping piece of land in the middle of the mountain.

At this time, the commune members had already eaten lunch, and everyone came up the mountain to reclaim wasteland. When they saw that Zhang Kelin had already arrived first, everyone was surprised and excited. His younger brother Zhang Keti asked him with a reproachful tone:

“Why didn't you wait for everyone to come together? What if you fall?” He wiped the sweat from his forehead and smiled: “If I come with you, you would have to carry me!”

When it was time to stop work, his younger brother wanted to carry him back, but he refused, saying, "Don't treat me like a child. I can go up and down. Let me try to walk by myself. The beginning is difficult, but it will be fine later. What's so scary about this?"

That night when he went to bed, he took off his artificial legs, and his thighs were swollen and red. He silently applied medicine and wrapped them with gauze. At night, the scars became inflamed, and the pain kept him awake all night, but he didn't say a word. The next day, he couldn't go up the mountain and felt bored at home. He thought to himself: I must pass this hurdle of going up the mountain! He pointed to his thighs and said to himself: "You are too tender, you must be tempered." After resting for two days, Zhang Kelin went up the mountain again. In seven or eight days, he finally learned to walk on mountain roads and climb slopes. In a month, he opened up more than two acres of wasteland, and also shoveled fifty or sixty loads of grass from the hillside and buried them underground as fertilizer. In the two acres of wasteland, he planted more than 120 pumpkins, more than 700 corns, more than 70 sweet potatoes, more than 50 taros, and green beans, cabbage.... It was really a mixed bag.

The wasteland was opened, the crops were planted, and after a few rains, tender green seedlings grew out of the yellow soil. Zhang Kelin looked at it and felt unspeakable joy, and he went up the mountain every day to carry some fertilizer and pile it at the end of the field. In the weather of late spring and early summer, there were more rainy days and fewer sunny days, and the mountain roads were slippery after the rain, making it difficult to move. He simply dug a large cave in the mountainside, installed a pot inside, prepared some food, and put a door panel as a bed. When it rained, he would not go down the mountain.

More than a month later, when the pumpkins were as big as fists and the corn was a foot tall, Zhang Kelin collapsed from exhaustion. Cadres and masses in the township and village came to see him every day to comfort him.

The care of the Party and the masses made him feel that he had infinite power. During his illness, Zhang Kelin reopened the book "Dedicate Everything to the Party," which he had already read several times. Before he was fully recovered, he went to attend a Party meeting. Township Party Secretary Liu Xirui greatly praised him, saying that he was a red flag that never faded. After the meeting, Liu Xirui earnestly criticized him: "Old Zhang, you should listen to everyone in the future. It is not good to rush and work hard according to your own nature. You should also look at your body. Some things that you really can't do should be less involved. You must be practical!" Zhang Kelin said gratefully: "Old Liu, I will definitely listen to you. I will definitely do what I can do in the future."

As soon as Zhang Kelin recovered from his illness, he participated in the summer harvest and summer planting like a dragon and a tiger. His footprints were left on the eleven threshing grounds in the village. However, people resolutely did not let him do heavy work again. He had to take on the work of inspection. Every day he had to run to the threshing grounds several times to see if the grain was threshed finely. When he saw some commune members not flailing the grain on all sides, he would make suggestions and ask everyone to flail a few more times.

After the establishment of the commune, the village wanted to run a children's canteen, but no one had any experience, and there were many difficulties. Zhang Kelin volunteered to take on this work. Had he done this work before? Never. But he thought: Since the masses need it, the Communist Party members should take the lead. No one is born knowing how to do this or that. Under his planning and running, the canteen for more than 400 children was soon set up, and it was run very well.

Now, Zhang Kelin spends most of his time working in the children's canteen, from doing ideological work for the canteen staff to helping the children serve food. He takes care of everything and is never idle from morning to night. One night, the cook Lin Ruiying complained: "I'm busy all day long, this work is meaningless." When he heard this, he said to her seriously: "Labor is not divided into high or low, and the more arduous and unnoticed things are, the more meaningful they are. To let the children eat well and be wholeheartedly for the next generation is a very glorious labor!"

    双腿失去红心在
    忆伊
    这个故事讲的张科林，是福建闽侯县城门人民公社龙江大队的党支部委员，今年三十九岁。十二年前，他在战争里失去了双腿。以后，在残废军人教养院里度过了几年。去年春天，领导上批准他回乡参加生产。
    这个失去双腿的英雄，始终保持着一颗火红的心。
    去年春天的一个早晨，和暖的阳光照耀着大地，一切都抹上了金色。张科林扛着一把大锹，直上青梁山。自从安上两条假腿以后的这许多年来，他还没走过这样崎岖的山路。走一步，冒一阵汗，没走几丈远，两腿又酸又痛，内衣全湿透了。他就地一坐，沉思起来：我这两条假腿能不能走山路？当然有困难，但是一定能，困难总是人克服的。他想起那一年贾汪战斗中失去了双腿，后来装上了假腿时自己是怎样练习走路的，那时不要说走，就是连站也吃不消呵！现在不是走得好好的吗？既然在平地上走路没问题，走山路的困难同样难不倒我！想到这里，他忽地站起来，继续前进。这时候自己感到步子有力多了。到了山脚下，仰起头望望：这山可不低啊！他顺着山边好容易走了一段，膝盖下面的假腿上坡弯不过来了，于是他便用两只手撑在地上爬。但是，左臂里至今还嵌着敌人的五颗子弹，伸起来比右臂短两寸，支撑不住，于是，他便侧着身子爬……。爬呀，爬呀，衣服被荆棘扯破了，手指甲里塞满了泥草，涨得难受，他全不理会。爬着爬着，脑子昏沉沉的，他在山坡上坐了片刻，往下一瞥：那绿一块黄一块的田畴，像缎子般的，村边的闽江就像一条银色的带子，眼前还有娇艳的桃花……。家乡多么美好的风光啊！张科林感到心胸十分宽阔。他又看看山上，光秃秃的一片，不禁自言自语道：看吧，过不了几年，定叫你桃红柳绿，果树成荫。他抽完了一袋烟，又伏在地上，拼着全力往山上爬，终于到达了山腰中的一片斜坡地。
    这时，社员们已经吃过午饭，大伙都上山开荒来了。一见张科林已经先到，大家又惊奇、又兴奋。弟弟张科题带着责备的口气问他：
  “你怎么不等大家一齐来，摔下去怎么办？”他擦擦额上的汗，笑道：“和你们一道来，你们不抬我才怪呢！”
    收工的时候，弟弟要驮他回去，他没答应，说：“你不要把我当小孩子，我能上也能下，你让我试着自己走，开头难，以后就好了，这有什么可怕的。”
    这天晚上睡觉的时候，他卸下假腿，大腿上都肿红了。他不声不响地敷上药，用纱布包包扎扎。夜里，伤疤发炎，疼痛使他一夜没有睡着，但他没吭一声。第二天，他没上成山，坐在家里闷的慌，心里忖道：上山的这一关一定要闯过！他指着大腿自言自语的说：“你也太嫩了，一定要磨练磨练。”歇了两天，张科林又上山了，七八天的功夫，他终于学会走山路，爬山坡。在一个月的时间里，他一锹一锹的开出了两亩多荒地，还在山坡上铲了草皮五、六十担，埋在地下作肥料。在两亩多的荒地里，他种下了一百二十多棵南瓜，七百多棵玉米，七十多棵山芋，五十多棵芋头，还有绿豆、白菜……真是五花八门。
    荒开了，庄稼种下了，几场雨以后，黄黄的地里长出了嫩绿的幼苗。张科林看着心里说不尽的欢喜，每天上山就背上点肥料堆在地头。春末夏初的天气，雨天多晴天少，雨后山路滑，寸步难行。他索性在山腰里挖了个大洞，在里边安了个锅，备点粮食，还放块门板当床铺，碰到雨天他就不下山。
    一个多月以后，当南瓜结得有拳头大，玉米长到尺把高的时候，张科林累倒了。乡里村里的干部和群众天天来看望他，安慰他。
    党和群众的关怀，使他感到自己有无穷的力量。在卧病的日子里，张科林重又翻开早已读过了好几遍的“把一切献给党”这本书。病还没全好，他就去出席了一次党的会议。乡支部书记刘希瑞大大表扬了他，说他是一面永不褪色的红旗。会议结束以后，刘希瑞语重心长地批评了他：“老张，你以后要听听大家的，按着自己的性子猛冲猛干是不行的。你也要看看你的身体，有些事情实在不能做的就少插手，要实事求是呵！”张科林感激地说：“老刘，我一定听你的话，以后一定能做什么就做什么。”
    张科林病一好，便又生龙活虎般地参加了夏收夏种，村子里十一个打谷场，都留下了他的足印。但是，人们坚决不让他再干重活。他只好担任起检查的工作来。每天他都要去各个打谷场上跑几遍，看看谷子打的精细不精细，见到有些社员掼谷子不四面掼，就提出意见，要大家多掼几把。
    公社成立以后，村子里要办儿童食堂，可是谁也没有经验，困难也不少。张科林便自告奋勇把这件工作担当下来。他过去搞了这个工作么？从来没有。可是他想：既然群众需要，共产党员就该带头干。谁也不是天生就学会干这干那的。在他筹划奔波下，这个四百多个儿童吃饭的食堂不久就办起来了，而且办得很好。
    现在，张科林的大部分时间是在儿童食堂里工作，从对食堂人员进行思想工作到帮孩子盛饭，什么事都管，从早到晚真是没个闲的。一天晚上，炊事员林瑞英怨声怨气地说：“一天忙到晚，这工作没什么意思。”他听到了，严肃地对她说：“劳动不分什么高低贵贱，越是艰苦的事，越是不被人注意的事，才是最有意义的。让孩子们吃饱吃好，全心全意为了下一代，这是非常光荣的劳动呵！”
