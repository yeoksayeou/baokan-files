Congress of Communist Builders
Soviet "Pravda" editorial, January 27

    Today, January 27, 1959, the eyes of all the people of our great Soviet country, the working people of all fraternal socialist countries, and all progressive humanity are focused on Moscow, on the Grand Kremlin. The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is convening here. The Congress will discuss and approve the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1959-1965, and adopt a magnificent program for the comprehensive development of communist construction in our country.

    Prior to the convening of the Congress, the theses of Comrade Khrushchev's report, "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet National Economy for 1959-1965," were widely discussed for more than two months. This extremely important document reflects the victories of the Party and the people in the struggle to implement the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It illuminates the prospects of Soviet development with the brilliance of Marxist-Leninist theory, and clarifies the most important issues of communist construction. The Party and all the Soviet people welcomed this outline with joy and unanimously and enthusiastically supported it.

    The control figures of our seven-year plan are the focus of world public attention. Billions of friends of the Soviet Union all over the world rejoice in the victories of our heroic people, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Lenin, were the first in history to complete the socialist revolution, defend their great achievements, and advance rapidly, paving the way to communism—the bright future of all mankind. Now even the enemies of socialism have to admit the achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of economy, science, and culture. The era when the bourgeois press attempted to discredit the bold creative plans of the Soviet state and called our five-year plans the unrealizable fantasies of the Bolsheviks is gone forever. Life has cruelly mocked these unfortunate prophets of the bourgeois world. The Soviet Union is demonstrating to the world its growing strength and power.

    Lenin put forward the brilliant idea of socialist economic planning and formulated its main principles. He was the inspirer and organizer of the first long-term plan for the development of the national economy—the scientifically based plan for the electrification of Russia. As early as 1920, Lenin, in explaining the Soviet state's transition to peaceful economic construction, in which millions of people participated with unprecedented speed and enthusiasm, said: "This is the beginning of the happiest era." He foresaw the long-term and grand economic plan that would unfold before the whole country, a plan that would show "how to transform Russia to the real economic foundation necessary for communism."

    Lenin's planning principles are the basis of the various five-year plans for the development of the national economy formulated by the Communist Party. As a result of the implementation of these plans, our country has become a powerful socialist country with a highly developed economy and advanced culture.

    Now, on the basis of the victories already achieved, it has become possible to move into a longer period of long-term planning. The theses of Comrade Khrushchev's report made a profound statement on the new historical period our country is entering:

    "The Soviet people, united around the Communist Party, have reached such a peak and achieved such magnificent reforms that it is now possible for our country to enter a new and most important stage of development—the stage of comprehensively expanding the construction of communist society. The main task of this period will be to comprehensively establish the material and technical foundation of communism, further strengthen our country's economic and defense capabilities, and at the same time increasingly and fully meet the growing material and spiritual needs of the Soviet people. This will be the decisive stage in competition with the capitalist world, in which a historical task will be practically accomplished—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all the Soviet people are confident that this task will be victoriously accomplished."

    The seven-year plan is an integral part of the long-term plan for the development of the national economy in the next fifteen years. It vividly embodies the Party's Leninist general line and the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism. After the completion of the seven-year plan, the total industrial output value will increase by about 80%, and the production of means of production will increase by 85%-88%. The total agricultural output value will increase by about 70%. The seven-year plan stipulates increasing national wealth, further greatly increasing the actual income of urban and rural people, substantially expanding the production and consumption of food and industrial products, and massively expanding residential construction. The control figures for the development of the national economy take into account the interests of improving the economy and culture of all the republics.

    All Soviet people regard the seven-year plan as a battle program calling on people to engage in creative labor and benefit the motherland. The thought that our country has entered a period of comprehensively expanding the construction of communist society makes the Soviet people even more delighted.

    Millions of Soviet people—workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals—discussed the control figures of the seven-year plan with great patriotic enthusiasm. In all their speeches, one idea, one hope, and one ambition run through—to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the seven-year plan.

    Love for the Communist Party, for one's own long-tested leaders and leaders, is the strongest feeling of the Soviet people, who are confidently entering the period of comprehensively expanding communist construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are implementing the Party's Leninist policies and striving for the complete victory of communism.

    The Communist Party is greeting the 21st Extraordinary Congress with great achievements. It is united and full of creativity in solving new tasks. The unity of the Party's ranks, the close ties with the people, and loyalty to the banner of Marxism-Leninism—this is the source of all the Party's achievements and the guarantee of the Party's continued victory in the future. At the congresses of the Communist Parties in the various republics, at the Party conferences in various border regions, states, cities, and districts, and at all levels of meetings of the Party organizations, the Communist Party members were full of surging political activity. These meetings emphasized how correct it was that the Party Central Committee promptly exposed and crushed the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. This was a despicable group that had left the people, violated the vital interests of the people, and attempted to undermine the implementation of the Leninist line pursued by the Party on all the most important issues of domestic and foreign policy. After cleaning up these factional activists, the Party became more closely united around the Central Committee, and mobilized all its strength to implement the most important measures to consolidate the Soviet state and develop economy and culture.

    With the approval and support of all the Soviet people, the Communist Party has consistently implemented the resolutions of the 20th Congress and implemented very important measures to reorganize the management of industry and construction, reorganize machine tractor stations, further consolidate the collective farm system, expand the power of the republics, strengthen the ties between schools and life, and improve the national education system. At the December Plenary Session, the Party Central Committee summarized the development of agriculture in the past five years and pointed out the specific tasks of further increasing agricultural production. Great measures have been taken to improve the material welfare of the working people.

    The launching of the first few artificial earth satellites in history and the first artificial planet of the solar system are masterpieces of the Soviet Union's achievements in the development of science and technology. The third Soviet artificial earth satellite is crossing all countries, traversing oceans and continents, and traveling high in the sky, and people all over the world can see it flying. And in a higher place, in cosmic space, the planet made by the Soviets is making an indefinite flight, showing the heroic labor and brilliant wisdom of the builders of communism—the Soviet people.

    The Soviet seven-year plan has great international significance. It once again powerfully proves that the Soviet people are fulfilling their internationalist responsibilities to the working people of all countries. This plan will further strengthen the world socialist system and help strengthen lasting peace in the world. The Soviet motherland, its capital—Moscow, cordially welcomes the distinguished guests from all over the world who are attending the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the delegations of fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties. The arrival of the delegations shows that the ties and cooperation between the fraternal parties, which are conducive to peace and socialism, are further expanding, and that the strength of the international communist movement based on Marxism-Leninism is more united.

    The great achievements our country has made are the result of the Soviet people's selfless labor and the result of the Communist Party's tireless political and organizational work. In recent years, all major resolutions of the Party have been adopted after full discussions among workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. On the one hand, the Party pursues Leninist policies, and on the other hand, it relies on the strength of the people's masses, on their unlimited trust and strong support. The reason why the Party has won such trust and love from the people is that it struggles wholeheartedly for the interests of the working people.

    The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will determine new tasks in communist construction. Armed with the resolutions of the Congress, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the beloved Party, will hold high the victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism and advance towards communism by leaps and bounds.

    Long live the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the Congress of Communist Builders!

    A warm salute to the delegates to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

    共产主义建设者的代表大会
    苏联“真理报”一月二十七日的社论
    今天，1959年1月27日，我们伟大的苏维埃国家的各族人民、各兄弟的社会主义国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类的目光都注视着莫斯科，注视着大克里姆林宫。苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会正在这里开会。代表大会将讨论和批准1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字，通过在我国全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。
    在代表大会召开之前，对赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”进行了两个多月的广泛讨论。这个极其重要的文件反映了党和人民在实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会历史性决议的斗争中的胜利，它以马克思列宁主义理论的光辉照耀着苏联的发展前景，阐明了共产主义建设的最重要的问题。党和全体苏联人民欢欣鼓舞地欢迎这个提纲，一致热烈拥护这个提纲。
    我国七年计划控制数字是世界公众的注意中心。全世界上苏联的亿万朋友都对我国英勇的人民的胜利表示欢欣，苏联人民在以列宁为首的共产党的领导下在历史上第一个完成了社会主义革命，捍卫了自己的伟大成果，并飞速前进，为走向共产主义——全人类的光辉未来开辟道路。现在甚至社会主义的敌人也不得不承认苏联在发展经济、科学和文化方面的成就。资产阶级报刊企图诋毁苏维埃国家大胆的创造性计划，称我们的五年计划为布尔什维克的不可实现的幻想的这种时代已经一去不复返了。生活狠狠地嘲笑了资产阶级世界的这些不走运的先知者。苏联正在向全世界表明它的力量和威力的蓬勃增长。
    列宁提出了社会主义经济计划化的天才思想，并且制定了其主要原则。他是第一个发展国民经济远景计划——有科学根据的俄罗斯电气化计划的鼓舞者和组织者。早在1920年，列宁在阐明苏维埃国家过渡到有千百万人以空前速度和积极性参加的和平经济建设时说：“这是最幸福的时代的开始”。他有远见地谈到那个将展开在全国面前的长期的伟大的经济计划，这个计划将表明“如何把俄国转变到为共产主义所必需的真正的经济基础上去”。
    列宁的计划化原则是共产党所制定的发展国民经济的各个五年计划的基础。由于这些计划的实现，我国已经成为了拥有高度发展的经济和先进文化的强大的社会主义国家。
    现在，在已取得的胜利的基础上，已有可能转入较长时期的远景规划。在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲中对于我国正在进入的新的历史时期作了深刻的说明：
    “团结在共产党周围的苏联人民已经达到了这样的顶峰，实现了这样宏伟的改革，以致使我国有可能在现在进入一个新的最重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。这个时期的主要任务将是全面地建立共产主义的物质技术基础，进一步加强我国的经济和国防力量，同时日益充分地满足苏联人民不断增长的物质和精神需要。这将是同资本主义世界竞赛的决定性阶段，在这个阶段中将实际完成一项历史任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。苏联共产党和全体苏联人民满怀信心地认为这项任务一定会胜利完成。”
    七年计划是今后十五年发展国民经济远景计划的组成部分，它生动地体现了党的列宁主义总路线和马克思列宁主义的不朽思想。七年计划完成以后，工业总产值将大约增加80％，生产资料的生产将增加85％—88％。农业总产值将大约增加70％。七年计划规定增加国家财富，进一步大大增加城乡人民的实际收入，大量扩大粮食和工业品的生产量和消费量，大规模展开住宅建筑。发展国民经济的控制数字考虑了提高各加盟共和国的经济和文化的利益。
    全体苏联人都把七年计划当作一个号召人们进行创造性的劳动、为祖国造福的战斗纲领。一想到我国已进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，苏联人的内心就更加欢欣鼓舞。
    千百万的苏联人——工人、集体农民和知识分子怀着极大的爱国热情讨论了七年计划控制数字，在他们的一切发言中都贯穿着一个思想、一个希望、一个抱负——完成和超额完成七年计划的任务。
    对共产党、对自己的久经考验的领袖和领导者的热爱是苏联人民最强烈的感情，他们正在满怀信心地进入全面展开共产主义建设的时期。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正在贯彻党的列宁主义的政策，争取共产主义的完全胜利。
    共产党以巨大的成就来迎接第二十一次非常代表大会，它团结一致，充满了解决新任务的创造力。党的队伍的团结一致，和人民的紧密联系，忠于马克思列宁主义的旗帜——这就是党获得一切成就的源泉，是党今后不断取得胜利的保证。在各加盟共和国的共产党代表大会上，在各边疆区、州、市和区的党代表会议上，在党组织的各级会议上，共产党员都充满了高涨的政治积极性。这些会议都强调指出了党中央委员会及时揭露并粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫反党集团，是多么正确。这是一个离开了人民的可鄙的集团，它违背了人民的切身利益，企图破坏党在国内政策和外交政策的所有最重要问题上奉行的列宁主义路线的实现。在清除这些派别活动分子之后，党更紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围，并且动员了它的全部力量来实现巩固苏维埃国家、发展经济和文化的最重要措施。
    共产党在全体苏联人民的赞同和支持下，始终不渝地贯彻第二十次代表大会的决议，实现了非常重大的措施来改组工业和建筑业的管理，改组机器拖拉机站，进一步巩固集体农庄制度，扩大加盟共和国的权力，加强学校同生活的联系和改进国民教育制度。党中央在12月全会上总结最近五年来农业的发展情况时，指出了进一步增加农产品产量的具体任务。在提高劳动人民的物质福利方面，采取了巨大措施。
    发射历史上最初几个人造地球卫星和第一个太阳系人造行星是苏联发展科学技术成就的杰作。第三个苏联人造地球卫星正在越过所有的国家，横越大洋和大陆，遨游高空，全世界人民都可以看到它在飞行。而在更高的地方，在宇宙空间，苏联人所制造的行星正在作无限期的飞行，它显示着共产主义建设者——苏联人民的英勇劳动和光辉的智慧。
    苏联七年计划有着巨大的国际意义。它再一次有力地证明苏联人民对世界各国的劳动人民履行着国际主义的职责，这个计划将进一步加强世界社会主义体系，有助于加强全世界的持久和平。苏维埃祖国，
  它的首都——莫斯科亲切地欢迎着从世界各地来参加苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的贵宾们——兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团。各代表团的来临说明各兄弟党之间有利于和平和社会主义的联系和合作进一步扩大，说明以马克思列宁主义为基础的国际共产主义运动的力量更加团结一致。
    我国获得的巨大成就是苏联人民忘我劳动的结果，是共产党不倦地进行政治工作和组织工作的结果。最近几年来，党的一切重大决议都是经过工人、集体农民和知识分子的全面讨论以后通过的。党一方面奉行列宁主义政策，一方面依靠人民群众的力量，依靠他们的无限信任和大力支持。党之所以得到人民的如此信任和爱戴，是因为它全心全意为劳动人民的利益而斗争。
    苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会将确定共产主义建设中的新任务。为代表大会的决议武装起来的苏联人民在亲爱的党的领导下将更高地举起马克思列宁主义的胜利旗帜，大踏步地向共产主义前进。
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会——共产主义建设者的代表大会万岁！
    向苏共第二十一次代表大会的代表热烈致敬！
