Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: According to TASS, Moscow, the "Pravda" published an editorial on the 5th entitled "The Planet of Communism," the full text of which is as follows:

Carried by a spacecraft, the flag with the Soviet national emblem has soared far beyond the Earth's boundaries. The Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket is flying in outer space. It has left the Moon and the Earth, entering its own elliptical orbit around the Sun. Considering the significance of this event, thoughts of humanity's past and future, as well as the fate of human social and spiritual development, flood the mind. At the dawn of a new era in social history, an artificial comet made by Soviet people flashed past the constellation Virgo on the celestial map.

Throughout all stages of human social and intellectual development, the idea of exploring the mysteries of the universe has run like a thread. As early as the dawn of history, human eyes and minds were drawn to the starry sky above the Earth. However, at that time, people could only fly to the universe on the wings of mythical fantasies. Laying a scientific foundation for the universe that excluded legends and myths took a very long period in the development of human worldview. It took many centuries for humans to break away from the Earth in their minds. This is also a great achievement of human wisdom, the achievement of Bruno, who founded the theory of the universe and the infinity of worlds, and who sacrificed his life for it, burned at the stake. In the Middle Ages, attempts were made to bind bold human wisdom with the shackles of feudal ideology. In the capitalist era, science did much to solve the mysteries of the universe. However, only socialist society has realized the first cosmic flight.

This great victory marks our country's entry into a period of large-scale construction of a communist society.

The Soviet cosmic rocket's first interplanetary flight opens a glorious page in the study of outer space and shows all mankind the creative genius of the free Soviet people and the great scientific and technological progress made by the working people of the world's first socialist country. This is what the CPC Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers said in their congratulatory message to the scientists, engineers, technicians, workers, and all staff who participated in the manufacture and launch of the cosmic rocket.

The fact that all the staff of the scientific research institutes, design bureaus, factories, and experimental institutions that manufactured this new rocket for interplanetary flight greeted the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with this launch has great historical significance. Humanity is entering the communist era while solving the great task of conquering the universe.

Today has entered a new stage of conquering the universe. For hundreds of years, flying like a bird has been an elusive ideal of conquering space. Many poets have lamented, "If only I were a bird!" Now this stage has ended. Scientists have concentrated on studying the wings that enable birds to fly. But how can a bird be compared to a human who relies on cosmic velocity to enter the universe! This event in human history will forever be linked to our country, which is building a communist society.

When the world victoriously shouted, "We are our own masters, we want to build a new world," and when our country began to build a new world marked by the red star, the British writer Wells, a bold author of science fiction, called Lenin a utopian. He did not understand that Communists combine fantasy with science when transforming the world. They declared war on Manilovism and any empty fantasy, because such fantasy separates people from life and reality. However, they inspired the daily labor of millions of people who create miracles with beautiful and achievable fantasies.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the vanguard of millions of working people. Guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, it seeks and paves the way to the future, teaching how to turn fantasy into reality. Empty fantasists and babblers, half-hearted surrenderers, and those who stagnate have lost their way. All these people have been cleared from the path of the Soviet people.

Khrushchev said: "The launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket means that we have opened the path from Earth to the Moon for the first time in the world. This victory is the result of the creative labor of the Soviet people who are building a communist society. Our creative labor has pushed the Soviet motherland to new and brilliant heights. It clearly shows what victories the people can achieve under the leadership of the Communist Party, advancing along the road illuminated by the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine."

The new victory of Soviet science is also proof of the high level of development of our industry, the great vitality of the social system that produced this industry, and the high level of consciousness and culture of the Soviet people, who built factories and laboratories, put them into production, and learned to manufacture things that even the most advanced capitalist countries are powerless to manufacture. In the socialist world, the ideas of science have broken free from the clutches of usurers and bankers, and serve the people and all progressive mankind. Able hands and bold wisdom work together, and calm scientific thinking and soaring fantasy are closely combined.

The hearts of the Soviet people are filled with immense pride in our country, and all progressive mankind feels the same way as the Soviet people. The entire socialist world is intently watching the first interplanetary flight. People's China says that the East Wind is getting stronger and stronger.

Socialism has achieved a new and great victory in its peaceful competition with capitalism. When the first artificial Earth satellite made by the Soviet Union appeared, bourgeois theorists, politicians, and journalists had to exclaim: "They have surpassed us!" Attempts to catch up with the Soviet Union either end in painful moans of disappointment or in empty boasting. Now, the braggarts have to remain silent. Western broadcasting companies tell the world: this "once again shows that we are ten years behind." The history of our era lies in the irresistible advance, strengthening, and development of socialism. History itself has doomed the capitalist world to inevitable decline. The days are not far off when the industrial products of socialist countries will surpass those of capitalist countries, and when the Soviet Union will reach the world's highest living standards and the shortest working day. With the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, this day will draw ever closer. There is no doubt that this magnificent plan will be realized.

The first year of the Seven-Year Plan began with the launch of a cosmic rocket, which is a good start!

### 共产主义星球运行宇宙  共产主义时代降临人间  苏联“真理报”发表社论祝贺红色火箭上天

    共产主义星球运行宇宙
    共产主义时代降临人间
    苏联“真理报”发表社论祝贺红色火箭上天
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”5日以“共产主义的星球”为题发表社论，全文如下：
    由宇宙飞船载负着的有苏联国徽的旗帜，已经远远地越出了地球范围。苏联第一个宇宙火箭正在宇宙空间飞行。它已离开月球和地球，进入自己绕太阳的椭圆形轨道。如果考虑一下这件事的意义，在脑海中就会涌起人类的过去和未来以及人类社会发展和精神发展的命运的思潮。在社会历史新纪元的开始时，苏联人制造的一个人造彗星闪过星球图上的室女星座。
    在人类社会和思想发展的各个阶段，都贯穿着探索宇宙奥秘的思想。早在历史上的黎明时期，人的目光和思想就被展现在地球上空的星空吸引住了。但是，当时人只能乘神话幻想之翼飞驰宇宙。对宇宙奠定排除了传说和神话的科学概念，这在人类世界观的发展史上是经过很长的时期的。经过了多少世纪，人才能够在思想上脱离地球。这也是人类智慧的伟大功绩，这是创宇宙和诸世界无限性学说的布鲁诺的功绩，布鲁诺曾因此而献出了他的生命，被烧死在柴堆上。在中世纪，曾企图用封建思想意识的桎梏束缚大胆的人类智慧。在资本主义时期，科学为解决宇宙之谜作了许多事情。但是，只有社会主义社会才实现了第一次宇宙飞行。
    这一伟大的胜利，标志着我国进入了大规模建设共产主义社会的时期。
    苏联宇宙火箭的第一次行星际飞行在宇宙空间的研究方面揭开了光荣的一页，并向全人类显示了自由苏联人民的创造天才和世界上第一个社会主义国家的劳动人民所取得的巨大的科学技术进步。这是苏共中央和苏联部长会议给参加制造和发射宇宙火箭的科学家、工程师、技术员、工人和全体工作人员的贺词中说的话。
    制造这一在行星际飞行的新火箭的各科学研究所、设计局、工厂和试验机构的全体工作人员以这次发射来迎接苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，这一事实有巨大的历史意义。人类是在解决征服宇宙的伟大任务的同时，进入共产主义时代。
    今天已进入征服宇宙的新阶段。在好几百年的时期内，像鸟那样的飞行都曾经是难以达到的征服空间的理想。许多诗人曾经感叹地说，如果我是个飞鸟那该多么好。现在这个阶段已结束了。科学家们曾经聚精会神地研究过使鸟飞行的翅膀。鸟哪里可以同依靠宇宙速度进入宇宙的人相比！人类历史上的这一事件将永远地同建设共产主义社会的我国联系在一起。
    当世界上胜利地高呼：“我们是自己的主人，我们要建设新世界”，当我国开始建设以红星为标志之一的新世界的时候，大胆的科学幻想小说作者英国作家威尔斯却把列宁称之为空想家。他不懂得，共产党人在改造世界的时候是把幻想和科学结合在一起的。他们向马尼洛夫精神和任何空洞的幻想宣战，因为这种幻想使人脱离生活，脱离实际。然而，他们用美好的和可以达到的幻想鼓舞了千千万万在创造奇迹的人的日常劳动。
    苏联共产党是千百万劳动人民的先锋队，它以马克思列宁主义理论为指南，寻找和铺设通向未来的道路，教导如何把幻想变成现实。空洞的幻想家和空谈家、半途而废的投降分子和那些裹足不前的人都迷失了方向。这些人都已从苏联人民的道路上被清除了出去。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“苏联宇宙火箭的发射意味着，我们在世界上最先打开了从地球通到月球的路。这个胜利是正在建设共产主义社会的苏联人创造性劳动的结果。我们的创造性劳动把苏维埃祖国推上了新的光辉灿烂的高峰。它清楚地表明，人民在共产党的领导下沿着伟大的马克思列宁主义学说所照耀的道路前进，能够取得什么样的胜利。”
    苏联科学的新胜利也是我国工业发展高度水平的证明，是产生这种工业的社会制度的伟大生命力的证明，是苏联人有着高度的觉悟和高度的文化的证明，他们兴建了工厂和试验室，投入了生产，学会了制造那些最先进的资本主义国家也无力制造的东西。在社会主义世界，科学的思想已经挣脱了高利贷者和银行家的魔爪，而为人民和全体进步人类服务。能干的双手和豪迈的智慧同时并用，冷静的科学思考和展翅高翔的幻想紧密地结合到一起。
    苏联人民的心中充满了对我国的巨大自豪感，全体进步人类也怀着同苏联人民一样的感情。整个社会主义世界都精神贯注地注视着第一次行星际飞行。人民中国说，东风已越来越强烈。
    社会主义在同资本主义的和平竞赛中取得了新的巨大胜利。当苏联制造的第一个人造地球卫星出现时，资产阶级的理论家、政治家和记者不得不惊呼：“他们超过我们了！”赶上苏联的企图不是流于痛苦的失望的呻吟，就是流于空洞的吹嘘。现在，好吹牛的人只好默不作声。西方的广播公司向全世界说：这“又一次表明我们落后了十年”我们时代的历史在于社会主义正在势不可挡地向前迈进、加强和发展。历史本身注定了资本主义世界必然趋于没落。社会主义国家工业产品超过资本主义，以及苏联达到世界上最高的生活水平和最短的工作日的日子已经不远了。随着七年计划的完成，这一天将日益逼近。毫无疑问，这个宏伟的计划必将实现。
    七年计划的第一年以发射宇宙火箭开始，这是一个良好的开端！
