Mountainous Areas, Hilly Areas, and Plains Each Have Their Own Production Methods; Xinle Develops Diversified Economy According to Local Conditions
    (Our report) Xinle County, Hebei Province, due to the correct implementation and execution of the central government's policy of "adapting to local conditions and developing a diversified economy," has achieved high-speed development of diversified economic undertakings. The people of the entire county have increased their income by more than 57.6 million yuan (including more than 21 million yuan converted from existing goods), accounting for 46% of the county's total industrial and agricultural output value. If calculated on a per capita basis, the income from diversified economic undertakings alone is 125 yuan per person.

    The high-speed development of diversified economic undertakings in this county encountered many ideological obstacles and practical difficulties. However, the party organizations at all levels have consistently adopted a firm attitude, utilizing all favorable conditions, relying on the masses, and using methods such as airing views and debates, and using pilot projects to lead the way, and correspondingly developed a diversified economy during the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. In April of last year, when the county party committee first proposed the plan for developing a diversified economy, some cadres believed that "developing a diversified economy is something that can be grasped or not grasped," and "as long as industrial and agricultural production is done well, everything will be easy." Some cadres in the commercial sector also believed that "dead goods trading (referring to cloth, oil, salt, etc.) is easy to do, but live goods trading (referring to pigs, rabbits, etc.) is difficult to do." Based on this, the county party committee proposed that each secretary and one to two committee members in the county and in the countryside should be assigned to manage this work. Immediately afterwards, the leading departments extracted three thousand people and established Wanjishan, livestock farms, fish fry factories, artificial superior breeding stations, Baicao paper mills, wineries, and rough feed processing plants in Koutou in the mountainous area, Shangfang in the hilly area, and Beicun in the plain area. The county party committee summarized the experiences of these pilot farms (factories) separately, proving that diversified economies can be developed in large quantities regardless of whether they are mountainous, hilly, or plain areas. It not only does not affect industrial and agricultural production, but also can provide a considerable amount of funds for expanding industrial and agricultural production. With living models, there are sufficient reasons to convince people, and these experiences have quickly been promoted. The number of people involved in diversified economic undertakings in the county increased from 10,000 to more than 60,000, forming 1,620 professional teams, making the development of diversified economic undertakings popular in every corner of the county.

    After the mass movement to develop diversified economic undertakings was widely launched, the first difficulties encountered were weak technical forces, insufficient funds, and narrow sales channels. The county party committee also proposed that cadres should learn technology from the masses, from technicians, and from books, and lead the masses to popularize technology, and conducted technical training courses to train more than 1,000 technicians, breaking through the technical barrier. Under the unified command of the county party committee, banks and credit cooperatives planned a considerable amount of funds to specifically support the development of a diversified economy. The commercial sector also extracted a considerable amount of manpower to sign contracts with various places and assist the masses in selling their products, and the situation of narrow sales channels quickly changed. The timely solution of these practical difficulties played a significant role in the development of a diversified economy.

    The county's development of a diversified economy started from many aspects based on the spirit of adapting to local conditions. In the mountainous areas, the characteristics of many mountains, many minerals, many medicinal materials, many mountains, many waters, and many grasses were seized, and a large amount of ore was mined, medicinal materials were collected, fish were raised, livestock were grazed, fruit trees were cultivated, and Baicao paper mills were established, etc. Koutou Commune is a mountainous area with water, grass, minerals, and medicinal materials. The party organization here led the masses to carry out ten major breedings (chickens, sheep, rabbits, etc.), ten major cultivations (fruit trees, medicinal materials, etc.), ten major exploitations (exploitation of mica stone, crystal stone, etc.), and ten major processings (Baicao papermaking, local specialty winemaking, etc.); In the hilly areas, the characteristics of many slopes and many grasses suitable for grazing were seized, and a large number of livestock were raised. In the plains, the characteristics of sandy wasteland, scattered land, and vacant land in villages were seized to raise a large number of pigs and chickens. Because the plains, hills, and mountains each seized the characteristics of their respective regions, by the end of November 1958, the county already had twenty-five Wanjishan, Wanjitan, one hundred and eighty-three collective poultry farms, one hundred and seven livestock groups, seven Wantugou, and one thousand and thirty collective pig farms, as well as one thousand four hundred and seventy various local product processing workshops. The number of pigs has increased to more than 580,000, the number of rabbits has increased to more than 110,000, and the number of large livestock such as cattle and horses has increased to more than 47,000, an increase of 1.6 to 4 times compared with the same period last year; The number of various fruit trees has increased from 2.12 million last year to more than 11 million; The total value of local product processing and mining of various ores is equivalent to five and a half times the total output value of last year.

### 山区丘陵平原各有生产门路  新乐因地制宜发展多种经济

    山区丘陵平原各有生产门路
    新乐因地制宜发展多种经济
    本报讯　河北新乐县由于正确的贯彻和执行了中央所提出的“因地制宜，发展多种经济”的方针，使多种经济得到了高速度的发展。全县人民增加了五千七百六十多万元（包括现有实物折款二千一百多万元），占全县工农业总产值的46％。如果按人口平均来算，只多种经济一项每人即可收入一百二十五元。
    这个县多种经济的高速度发展，曾遇到了许多思想阻力和实际困难。但各级党的组织始终采取了坚定不移的态度，利用各方面的有利条件，依靠群众，通过鸣放辩论，以点带面等方法，在工农业大跃进的时候，相应的发展了多种经济。去年4月，县委刚刚提出发展多种经济的规划时，有的干部就认为“发展多种经济是可抓可不抓的事”，“只要工农业生产搞好了，一切都好办”。商业部门有些干部还认为“死物买卖（指布匹、油盐等等）好做，活物买卖（指猪、兔等等）不好干”。据此，县委提出从县到农村都规定一名书记和一至二名委员管理此项工作。紧接着领导部门抽出了三千人在山区的口头，丘陵区的上方，平原上的贝村，先后建立了万鸡山、畜牧场、鱼苗厂、人工优种配种站、白草造纸厂、酿酒厂、粗饲料加工厂等等。县委分别总结了这些试点场（厂）的经验，证明不论山区、丘陵、平原都可以大量发展多种经济，它不但影响不了工农生产，而且还可以给扩大工农业生产提供相当数量的资金。有了活的样板，就有了充分说服人的理由，这些经验也就很快的得到了推广。全县投入多种经济的由一万人增至六万多人，组成了一千六百二十个专业队，使发展多种经济事业普及到全县各个角落。
    大量发展多种经济的运动广泛开展后，首先所碰到的困难是技术力量薄弱、资金不足、销路不广。县委又提出干部要向群众、向技术员、向书本学技术，带动群众普及技术，并分项举办了技术训练班，培养了一千多名技术员，突破了技术关。银行、信用社在县委的统一指挥下，筹划了相当数量的资金，专门支持多种经济的发展。商业部门还抽出了相当大的力量同各地订立合同，协助群众推销产品，销路不广的局面很快就改变了。这些实际困难的及时解决，对发展多种经济起了很大的作用。
    这个县发展多种经济，是本着因地制宜的精神从多方面入手的。在山区，就抓住了山多矿多药材多，山多水多草也多的特点，大量开矿石、采药材、养鱼、放牧、培植果树、建立白草造纸厂等等。口头公社是个山区，有水有草有矿有药材，这里的党组织就领导群众开展十大养（鸡、羊、兔等），十大培育（果树、药材等），十大开采（开采云母石、水晶石等），十大加工（白草造纸、土特产做酒等）；在丘陵地区，就抓住坡多草多，适于放牧的特点，大量饲养家畜。在平原，就抓住了沙荒、零散地、村头空地大量养猪、养鸡。由于平原、丘陵、山区各自抓住了本地区的特点，到1958年11月底，全县已有二十五个万鸡山、万鸡滩，一百八十三个集体养禽场，一百零七个畜牧群，七个万兔沟，一万零三十个集体养猪场，还有一千四百七十个各种土产加工作坊。猪只已发展到五十八万多头，兔发展到一十一万多只，牛、马等大牲畜发展到四万七千多头，比去年同期的数量分别增加了一点六倍到四倍；各种果树由去年的二百一十二万棵增到一千一百多万棵；土产加工和开采各种矿石的总值相当于去年总产值的五倍半。
