Increase Production, Eliminate Waste, Eat Frugally
Fuzhou Special District Fully Launches Planned Grain Consumption

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th – Increase production and eliminate waste, eat well while saving; Fuzhou Special District in Jiangxi Province is fully launching planned grain consumption work in all counties.

After Fuzhou Special District had a bumper grain harvest and increased production, many cadres and masses began to relax their planned grain consumption efforts. Some cadres and masses believed that: since grain production has increased so much, why bother with planned grain consumption? In order to overcome this phenomenon, all counties have promptly launched publicity and education work on planned grain consumption. Le'an County, at the county-wide conference of socialist activists held in December of last year, simultaneously put forward the requirements for planned grain consumption. The grain department printed and distributed publicity materials on planned grain consumption and continued practicing strict frugality. Some activists also went to communes with well-run public canteens and planned grain consumption to conduct on-site visits. According to a survey in Nancun Township of this county, most of the canteens in the township have already achieved planned grain consumption, ensuring people eat their fill and eat well while not wasting grain. Lichuan County organized seven work groups, led by members of the county party committee, to go down to the communes and teams to specifically help the communes do a good job in grain distribution and management within the commune and carry out planned grain consumption work. In many areas of Nanfeng County, due to thorough publicity, general commune canteens have begun to implement planned grain consumption, achieving eating their fill, eating well, and saving.

At present, while consolidating communes and improving the lives of commune members, all counties in Fuzhou Special District are focusing on strengthening leadership over canteens and improving various systems, so as to make planned grain consumption a regular practice.

    增产不浪费　吃饭要节约
    抚州专区全面开展计划用粮工作
    新华社南昌10日电　增产不浪费，吃饱又节约，江西抚州专区各县正在全面开展计划用粮工作。
    抚州专区粮食丰收增产以后，不少干部和群众开始对计划用粮工作有些放松。有的干部和群众认为：粮食增产这么多，用粮还要讲什么计划。为了克服这种现象，各县都及时开展了计划用粮的宣传教育工作。乐安县在去年12月召开的全县建设社会主义积极分子大会上，同时提出了计划用粮的要求，粮食部门印发了关于计划用粮、继续厉行节约的宣传材料。一部分积极分子还到公共食堂办得好、用粮有计划的乡进行现场参观。现在据这个县南村乡的调查，全乡大部分食堂已经做到计划用粮，在吃饱吃好的同时不浪费粮食。黎川县组织了七个工作组，由县委委员率领下社下队，具体帮助公社做好社内粮食分配管理和开展计划用粮工作。南丰县许多地区由于宣传得深透，一般公社食堂都开始实行计划用粮，做到吃饱吃好吃省。
    抚州专区各县目前都在整社和搞好社员生活的同时，着重加强对各食堂的领导，健全各项制度，做到使计划用粮经常化。
