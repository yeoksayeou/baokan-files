With the premise of "guaranteeing key projects and taking care of general projects," a batch of key capital construction projects in Shandong Province are being accelerated.

These projects are all enterprises above the quota in the fields of metallurgy, machinery, coal, and electricity. Due to insufficient design, construction, installation and building materials supply, these projects only completed 49% of the annual plan from the beginning of 1958 to the end of October. Since the Provincial Party Committee's capital construction telephone conference in October proposed guaranteeing key projects, construction projects have made rapid progress. Zouwu No. 1 and No. 2 mines in the Zaozhuang Mining Area have now been completed and put into production ahead of schedule; the first phase of the Jining Power Plant has also been completed ahead of schedule. In order to ensure key projects, Jinan City, in addition to organizing Changqing, Licheng, Zhangqiu and other counties to produce a large number of building materials such as bricks and tiles, also launched a city-wide industrial "anti-drought" campaign, and cleared out more than 21,000 cubic meters of timber, more than 2,300 tons of steel, and 2,580 tons of cement, thereby ensuring the needs of key projects in Jinan City.

In order to guarantee the completion of key projects, the Provincial Capital Construction Committee transferred 56 cadres from the Metallurgical Bureau, Machinery Department, Electric Power Bureau, Railway Bureau and the Provincial Urban Construction Bureau to form eight inspection teams, which went to Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Zibo, Jining and other regions to inspect the progress of capital construction work and the preparation for capital construction in the first quarter.

　　(By our reporter) Under the slogan of guaranteeing key projects and supporting key projects, the communist spirit of great collaboration is even higher at the various capital construction sites in Lanzhou City. Supporting key construction has become a conscious action of various construction units.

In order to support key projects, workers from many non-key construction units beat gongs and drums and transported steel and wood to the construction sites of key projects. For example, when the workers at the Xigu Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant construction site heard that the Comprehensive Machine Tool Plant construction site lacked bamboo poles, they pushed carts and delivered more than 900 bamboo poles from more than 20 miles away. The workers at the Thermal Power Equipment Plant construction site also took the initiative to support the Comprehensive Machine Tool Plant construction site with 200 bamboo poles. In order to support the Comprehensive Machine Tool Plant construction site, the workers of the United Iron Parts Processing Plant completed the processing task of more than three tons of roof trusses in a concentrated effort. In order to help the Machine Tool Plant construction site solve transportation difficulties, all the cadres of the Material and Tool Section of the First Construction Company of the city concentrated their manpower to deliver 50,000 red bricks, 110 cubic meters of wood, and 1,500 mao bamboo to the Machine Tool Plant construction site in one day. Other units and construction sites such as Northwest Machinery Plant, Coal Industry Bureau, Hydraulic Power Generation School, Flat Glass Factory, Yongdeng Cement Plant, Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory, and Lanzhou Auto Parts Factory also supported key projects with steel, wood, lighting equipment, various equipment and machinery.

### 众星捧月　确保重点  山东省和兰州市集中人力物力保证重点工程快步前进

    众星捧月　确保重点
    山东省和兰州市集中人力物力保证重点工程快步前进
    本报讯　在“保证重点，照顾一般”的前提下，山东省的一批重点基本建设项目正在加速建设。
    这些项目都是冶金、机械、煤炭、电力方面限额以上的企业。由于设计、施工、安装建筑材料的供应等方面力量不足，这些工程自1958年年初开工以来到10月底，仅完成年计划的49％。自从10月省委基本建设电话会议提出保证重点以后，建设工程有了较快的进展。枣庄矿区的邹坞一号和二号矿井，现已提前完工投入生产；济宁电厂第一期工程也已提前完工。济南市为了确保重点项目，除组织长清、历城、章丘等县大量生产砖、瓦等建筑材料外，并开展了全市工业“抗旱”运动，共清查出库存木材两万一千多立方，钢材两千三百多吨，水泥两千五百八十吨，从而保证了济南市重点工程的需要。
    为了保证重点项目的完成，省基本建设委员会从冶金局、机械厅、电业局、铁路局和省城市建设局等单位抽调了五十六名干部，组成八个检查组，分赴济南、青岛、烟台、淄博、济宁等地区，检查基建工作进展情况和第一季度基建的准备工作。
    本报讯　兰州市各基本建设工地，在保证重点支援重点的口号下，共产主义大协作的风气更为高涨。支援重点建设已成为各建设单位的自觉行动。
    为了支援重点工程，许多非重点建设单位的职工，敲锣打鼓，把钢材、木料运到重点工程的工地。如西固氮肥厂工地的职工听说综合机床厂工地缺乏竹竿，他们就推着架子车，从二十多里路远的地方把九百多根竹竿送来。火力发电设备厂工地的职工也主动将二百根竹竿支援综合机床厂工地。联合铁件加工厂的职工，为了支援综合机床厂工地，突击完成了三吨多的屋架加工任务。为了支援机床厂工地解决运输困难，市建一公司料具科全体干部在一天当中集中人马给机床厂工地送红砖五万块，木材一百一十立方，毛竹一千五百根。其他如西北机械厂、煤炭工业局、水力发电学校、平板玻璃厂、永登水泥厂、兰州毛纺厂、兰州汽车配件厂等单位和工地，都分别以钢材、木料、照明设备、各种器材和机械支援重点工程。
