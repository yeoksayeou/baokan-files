Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 23rd: Our correspondent reports: The opening date of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is getting closer and closer. The political enthusiasm and production competition upsurge inspired by this congress of "Communist Builders" and the Seven-Year Plan are unfolding magnificently throughout the Soviet Union. The people's communist spirit is burning like wildfire.

Production competition successes to greet the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are coming from all directions. Accelerating the speed of communist construction and laying a good foundation for the Seven-Year Plan is the characteristic of this competition. In the machinery manufacturing industry, the competition initiated by the machine-building workers of the Urals and Ukraine to accelerate the manufacture of machinery and equipment has been responded to by various regions. The workers of the Ural Machinery Factory guarantee that the machines produced by the factory will be the most advanced and economical in the world. The New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Factory in Ukraine decided to adopt new technologies in production as quickly as possible, while also rapidly shortening the design and technical preparation period.

Workers at construction sites everywhere are accelerating the pace of construction. The spearhead of the competition is directly aimed at the goals of seizing time and speeding up. A large chemical factory in Kemerovo was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, but the employees decided to strive for completion two months ahead of schedule in order to accelerate the development of the chemical industry. The No. 5 giant blast furnace in Kuzbass was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, but the employees have now decided to complete it at least one month ahead of schedule. Many construction site employees have even made guarantees to shorten the construction time by more than one year. For example, the Mamakan Hydropower Station, the northernmost hydropower station in the Soviet Union under construction, was originally scheduled to be completed in 1961, but the employees are preparing to transmit electricity one year ahead of schedule in 1960.

Although 1959 has just begun, many new enterprises and projects have already been completed. The Stalingrad Aluminum Factory has begun producing aluminum ingots, the largest electric furnace in the country has been built in the Lipetsk region, a large coke oven has been completed ahead of schedule at the Dneprodzerzhinsk Coke Chemical Factory, and the Snimkent Cement Factory has broken the record by completing the first phase of the project one year ahead of schedule in nineteen months. In the days leading up to the Congress, the second section of the bed of the Bit-Donets Canal was completed ahead of schedule. Moscow builders have also built 150,000 square meters of housing.

In the days leading up to the Congress, the Soviet agricultural workers have great enthusiasm. The Ryazan region took the lead in launching a competition to complete the seven-year plan for meat production in two or three years. Various regions have pledged to increase meat production this year by a big margin, doubling it compared to last year. Farmers in Northern Kazakhstan said that not only must grain be abundant, but meat must also be abundant. Farmers in Stalingrad said that our potential is still very great. Farmers in Kuban guarantee that they will deliver 250,000 tons of meat to the state this year, an increase of 150% over last year, with pork increasing by 350%.

Working according to communist requirements has become the most prominent slogan in this competition. The young workers of the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory spent an evening of voluntary work to make twenty-one combine harvesters as a gift to the Congress. The workers of the "January Uprising" factory in Kiev are fighting for the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade." They reduced the repair time from 300 hours to 150 hours, and used waste materials to repair two carriages as a gift. From the implementation of the latest technology to picking up scrap steel and scrap iron, the youth are working with a communist attitude. Many units have already won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade." The Kosnetov team of the No. 66 mine of the Tula Coal Company created a world record of 1,670 meters of tunneling and won the title of "Communist Labor Brigade." The famous Korchik coal mining team in Donbass has also won the title of "Communist Labor Brigade" because each person has overfulfilled the plan by more than three tons per shift.

    向党的代表大会献礼　为七年计划作好开端
    苏联人民掀起生产竞赛高潮
    竞赛运动波澜壮阔展开　生产捷报四面八方传来
    新华社莫斯科23日电　本社记者报道：苏共第二十一次代表大会开幕的日期越来越近了。这个“共产主义建设者”的代表大会和七年计划在苏联人民中所鼓舞起来的政治热情和生产竞赛热潮，正在波澜壮阔地在苏联全国各地展开。人民的共产主义精神像烈火一样地燃烧了起来。
    迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会的生产竞赛捷报正在从四面八方传来。加速共产主义建设的速度、为七年计划打下良好开端——是这次竞赛的特点。在机器制造业中，乌拉尔和乌克兰的机械制造工人发起加快制造机器设备的竞赛获得了各地的响应。乌拉尔机器厂的工人们保证要使工厂生产的机器成为世界上最先进、最经济的机器。乌克兰新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器厂决定，要最快地在生产中采用新技术，同时迅速缩短设计和技术准备期限。
    各地建筑工地的工人正在加快建设的步伐。竞赛的矛头直接指向争取时间、加快速度的目标。基米罗伏一家大化学工厂原订在今年年底落成，但是，职工们为了加速化学工业的发展，决定争取提前两月完工。库兹巴斯的第五号巨型高炉原订今年年底完工，职工们现在决定至少提前一个月完工。许多工地职工甚至提出要缩短建设时间一年以上的保证。例如，正在建设中的苏联最北部的玛马坎水电站原定在1961年完工，职工们准备提前一年在1960年送电。
    虽然1959年刚刚开始，但是已经有不少新企业和工程落成了。斯大林格勒制铝工厂已开始出产铝锭，利佩茨克州建成了一座全国最大的电炉，第聂伯罗捷尔任斯克焦炭化学工厂提前建成了一座大焦炉，斯尼姆肯特水泥厂更大破纪录，以十九个月时间提前一年完成第一期工程。在代表大会前的日子里，比顿涅茨运河提前完成了第二段河床。莫斯科建设者又建成了十五万平方公尺的房屋。
    在迎接代表大会的日子里，苏联农业劳动者的干劲很大。梁赞州首先发起竞赛，要在两、三年内完成肉类生产的七年计划。各地纷纷保证要提前使肉产量今年比去年猛增一倍。北哈萨克农民说，不仅要使粮食丰富，肉类也要同样丰富。斯大林格勒的农民说，我们的潜力还大得很。库班农民保证今年要交给国家二十五万吨肉类，比去年增加一倍半，其中猪肉要猛增三倍半。
    按共产主义的要求来工作成为这次竞赛中最鲜明的口号。罗斯托夫农业机械制造厂的青工们用了一晚上义务工作的时间，制成了二十一部联合收割机，作为给代表大会的献礼。基辅的“一月起义者”工厂的工人们正在为争取“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号而斗争。他们将修车时间从三百小时减少到一百五十小时，并且利用废料修了两个车厢作为献礼。从实施最新技术到拣拾废钢、废铁，青年们都以共产主义的态度劳动。许多单位已经获得了“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号。图拉煤矿公司第六十六号矿井科斯涅托夫工作队创造了掘进一千六百七十公尺的世界纪录，获得了“共产主义劳动队”的称号。顿巴斯有名的科尔契克采煤工作队由于每人每班都超额三吨多完成计划，也获得了“共产主义劳动队”的称号。
