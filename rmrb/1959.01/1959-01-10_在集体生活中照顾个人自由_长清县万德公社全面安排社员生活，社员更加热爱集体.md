    Taking Care of Individual Freedom in Collective Life
    Wandegong Commune in Changqing County Comprehensively Arranges Members' Lives, Making Members Love the Collective Even More
    According to news from Shandong Dazhong Daily, the Wandegong People's Commune in Changqing County correctly resolved the relationship between the large collective of the commune and individual freedom, and comprehensively arranged the lives of its members, making them love the collective even more, thereby promoting production and consolidating the People's Commune.
    The members of Wandegong People's Commune, in the struggle to win last year's bumper harvest, fully recognized the enormous role of collective strength in transforming nature and developing production. However, while implementing the large collective, people also raised some questions about individual freedom. For example: It is very good that the canteen implements free meals, but can the elderly, sick, pregnant women, and children take their meals home? Can they entertain relatives and friends when they come? Can a small store be set up for members to exchange and change tastes? Can a day or two off be given each month to handle housework and visit relatives? Li Laoda Niang of Wuzhuang said: "Who doesn't love the large commune? Eating is free; but it would be even better if each family could raise some chickens and ducks and prepare some side dishes."
    The commune's Party committee attached great importance to these demands of the masses. First, a frank and open discussion was launched in the Party committee. On the one hand, it criticized the erroneous view that these were all trivial matters of life, and that it was unimportant whether they were resolved or not; on the other hand, it also criticized the idea of overemphasizing collective life or one-sidedly emphasizing individual freedom. Through discussion, everyone agreed that the People's Commune is not only the organizer of the people's production, but also the organizer of the masses' lives. Correctly handling the relationship between collective life and individual life is a major issue closely related to every member, and it is also an important link in consolidating the People's Commune. Therefore, the commune must consider both the collective interests and take care of and satisfy the different needs and hobbies of the members in life in many ways, and try its best to take care of the members' individual freedom under the premise of obeying the large collective. After solving the leadership's thinking, the issue of the large collective and individual freedom was brought to the masses for frank and open discussion. The Party committee secretary also went deep among the masses to visit and talk, and humbly listened to the opinions and demands of the masses on this issue. Through frank and open discussion and individual visits, the reasonable demands of the masses on the issue of individual freedom were concentrated; some one-sided and erroneous demands were also criticized. Everyone realized that without the large collective, there could be no individual freedom.
    On the basis of the broad masses drawing clear ideological boundaries and unifying their understanding, and according to the opinions and demands of the masses, after repeated research by the commune's Party committee, some principles and systems were established on the premise of being beneficial to collective production and life. All 154 public canteens in the commune, based on the principles of eating cooked food, eating hot food, eating enough, and eating well, also made some flexible regulations on individual freedom, giving members necessary care in many ways. Public canteens tried their best to ensure one table per household or freely combined tables for meals; under the condition of preventing waste, members who did not want to eat in the canteen could take their meals home; on rainy days, holiday dinners, or when there were elderly people, children, pregnant women, or women in confinement at home, they could take out grain and vegetables from the canteen and cook their own meals at home. The canteen distributed 50% of the cooking oil and part of the vegetables to the members, and the members could make their own pickles; when relatives and friends came to the members' homes, the canteen could entertain guests' meals, or take back oil, grain, and vegetables to cook their own meals to entertain guests; nursing homes, maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens could set up separate small stoves. Each public canteen universally attached a small store for cash transactions, retailing better foods, side dishes, seasonings, as well as cigarettes, alcohol, pastries, tea, etc., to meet the needs of the members.
    This commune, while establishing public canteens, implemented "four retentions": that is, retaining the small stoves in the members' homes, so that members can participate in the collective canteen and also cook something they want to eat or entertain relatives and friends at home; retaining the market, facilitating the exchange of various living materials for the members; retaining restaurants, taverns and tea houses, supplying the needs of passing travelers and members; retaining and expanding more than ten wineries, pastry factories, sauce gardens, oil mills, flour mills and other workshops, producing a large number of various non-staple foods, and supplying them to small stores for retail.
    In terms of breeding, in addition to vigorously developing collective breeding, establishing pig farms, rabbit farms, and chick hatcheries, the commune also allowed members to raise one or two pigs, two sheep, and chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, silkworms, bees, etc., and the commune also distributed a portion of feed. This not only developed a variety of economies, but also increased the income of members and improved their lives. The commune also implemented a vacation system for members. In addition to short-term shock tasks when necessary, it generally guaranteed that members had eight hours of sleep, ten hours of labor, four hours of eating and rest, and two hours of study and entertainment every day. Male members were given two days off each month, and female members were given three to five days off, which they could use to handle housework and visit relatives and friends. There were also six holidays each year (May Day, National Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, New Year, Spring Festival) for holidays and dinners.
    The commune also distributed some small grains such as cowpeas and mung beans to the members for their own disposal. Members were allowed to take time to pick up some firewood for tea and heating. The commune also assigned people to help handle the red and white happy events of the members according to the habits of the masses, without replacing the price.
    In addition, members are allowed to plant and eat by themselves the scattered fruit trees and small vegetable plots next to the members' houses. In addition to paying wages on time every month, some pocket money is also given to old people without children every month.
    Because the commune correctly handled the relationship between the large collective of the commune and the individual freedom of the members, the members were satisfied and said: "The People's Commune is a paradise, taking care of everything in life, and from now on, there is no worry about eating and wearing, and we will concentrate on production." This further promoted production and consolidated the People's Commune. More than 6,000 laborers in the commune enthusiastically participated in the collaborative army supporting other regions, and more than 2,000 iron and steel soldiers also completed last year's iron and steel production tasks ahead of schedule and in excess. In agricultural production, 6,000 laborers carried out a second re-harvest in order to collect well and carefully, and recovered more than one million catties of sweet potatoes, 50,000 catties of peanuts, more than 30,000 catties of cotton, and more than 10 million catties of firewood. Now the agricultural army is rushing to topdress and water 20,000 mu of wheat fields, and the daily progress is accelerating.

    在集体生活中照顾个人自由
    长清县万德公社全面安排社员生活，社员更加热爱集体
    据山东大众日报消息　长清县万德人民公社，正确地解决了公社大集体和个人自由的关系，全面安排了社员生活，使社员更加热爱集体，从而推动了生产，巩固了人民公社。
    万德人民公社的社员，在争取去年丰收的斗争中，充分认识到集体力量在改造自然、发展生产方面的巨大作用。但是，在实行大集体的同时，人们也提出了有关个人自由的一些问题。如：食堂实行吃饭不要钱很好，但老年人、病人、孕妇、儿童可不可以把饭打回家去吃？来了亲戚朋友可不可以招待招待？可不可以设个小卖部让社员调换调换口味？可否每月放一两天假处理家务、走走亲戚？武庄李老大娘说：“大公社，谁不爱，吃饭不要钱；可是每家能养上些鸡鸭，添备些小菜那又多好。”
    公社党委对于群众的这些要求十分重视。首先在党委会中展开了鸣放辩论。一方面批判了那种认为这都是些生活琐事，解决与否无关紧要的错误看法；另方面也批判了那种过分强调集体生活或片面强调个人自由的思想。通过辩论，大家一致认为：人民公社不仅是人民群众生产的组织者，而且也是群众生活的组织者。正确处理集体生活和个人生活的关系，这是同每一个社员休戚相关的大事，也是巩固人民公社的重要一环。因此公社必须既考虑集体利益，又照顾和多方面地满足社员生活上不同的需要和爱好，在服从大集体的前提下，尽量照顾社员的个人自由。在解决了领导思想以后，又把大集体和个人自由的问题拿到群众中去鸣放辩论。党委书记也深入到群众中访问谈心，虚心听取群众对这个问题的意见和要求。通过鸣放辩论和个别访问，集中了群众对个人自由问题的合理要求；也批判了一些片面的和错误的要求。使大家认识到：没有大集体，就谈不上个人自由。
    在广大群众划清思想界限、统一认识的基础上，根据群众的意见和要求，经过公社党委的反复研究，在有利于集体生产和生活的前提下，建立了一些原则和制度。全社一百五十四处公共食堂，根据吃熟、吃热、吃饱、吃好的原则，在个人自由方面也做了一些灵活的规定，从多方面给社员必要的照顾。公共食堂尽量做到一户一桌或自由结合编桌吃饭；在防止浪费的条件下，社员不愿在食堂吃饭可以打回家去；雨天、假日会餐或家中有老人、小孩、孕妇、产妇时，可以从食堂领出粮食和蔬菜自己回家做饭吃。食堂分给社员50％的食油和部分蔬菜，社员可以自己腌制小菜；社员家中来了亲友，食堂可招待客饭，也可领回油、粮、蔬菜，自己做饭菜待客；敬老院、妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园，可另立小灶。各公共食堂普遍附设了现金交易的小卖部，零售较好的食品、小菜、调料以及烟、酒、糕点、茶叶等，以满足社员需要。
    这个公社在成立公共食堂的同时，实行了“四保留”：即保留社员家中的小锅灶，使社员在参加集体食堂的同时，也可在家做点想吃的东西或招待亲友；保留集市，便利社员交换各种生活资料；保留饭馆、酒馆和茶馆，供应过往旅客和社员需要；保留和扩建了十余处酿酒厂、糕点厂、酱园、油坊、粉房等各种作坊，大量生产各种副食品，供给小卖部零售。
    在饲养方面，公社除大力发展集体饲养、建立养猪场、养兔场、及小鸡孵化场外，也允许社员自养一至两头猪、两头羊和鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、蚕、蜂等，公社还发给一部分饲料。这样既发展了多种经济，又增加了社员收入，改善了社员生活。该社还实行了社员休假制度。除了必要时的短期突击任务外，一般都保证了社员每天有八小时睡眠、十小时劳动、四小时吃饭休息、两小时学习娱乐的时间。每月男社员放假两天，女社员放假三至五天，他们可利用假日处理家务、走亲探友。每年还有六个节日（五一节、国庆节、端午节、中秋节、新年、春节）放假和聚餐。
    该社还分给社员一部分豇豆、绿豆等小杂粮，由社员自己处理。允许社员抽空拾些柴草，以便烧茶取暖。社员们的红白喜事，也都由公社按照群众的习惯调人帮助办理，不取代价。
    此外，对于社员宅旁的零星果树和小片菜畦，允许自种自食。每月除按时发放工资外，对无儿无女的老人每月还发给一些零花钱。
    由于该社正确处理了公社大集体和社员个人自由的关系，社员满意地说：“人民公社是乐园，样样生活照顾全，从此不愁吃和穿，一心一意搞生产”。从而进一步推动了生产，巩固了人民公社。全社六千多名劳动力，干劲十足地参加了支援其他地区的协作大军，两千多名钢铁大军也提前超额完成了去年的钢铁生产任务。在农业生产上，六千名劳动力为了收好、收细，进行了二次复收，共收回地瓜一百多万斤、花生五万斤、棉花三万余斤、柴草一千多万斤。现在农业大军正向两万亩麦田突击追肥和浇水，日进度逐日加快。
