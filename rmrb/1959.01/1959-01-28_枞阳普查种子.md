According to the Anhui Daily, Congyang, Anhui, is currently carrying out a seed census to ensure sufficient high-quality seeds for the spring planting.

The seed census in Congyang County includes seeds retained by the people's communes and seeds in the national inventory. The county has transferred technical cadres, in coordination with cadres from district agricultural technology stations and grain stations, to organize nine inspection teams to go deep into various warehouses to inspect seed storage conditions. During the inspection, various locations adopted a method of inspecting and improving simultaneously. If insufficient seeds for selection and retention were found, they were supplemented according to the requirements of the spring planting plan. For those seeds that were determined to be suitable for planting after testing, dedicated personnel were assigned to be responsible for storage, and a responsibility system was established. At the same time, storage was implemented by variety, grade, and warehouse to improve seed quality. (Attached picture)

    枞阳普查种子
    据安徽日报消息　安徽枞阳为了保证春种中有足够的优良种子，最近开展种子普查工作。
    枞阳县这次种子普查，包括人民公社自留种、国家库存的种子等方面。县里抽调了技术干部，配合区农技站、粮站干部，组织九个检查组，深入各仓库，检查种子贮藏的情况。各地在检查中，采取一边查一边改进的办法，发现选留种子不足的，就按照春种计划的要求，补选留足。对于检验后确定能做种子的，就确定专人负责保管，建立责任制，同时，还实行分品种、分等级、分仓库贮存，以提高种子质量。（附图片）
