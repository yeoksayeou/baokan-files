Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, January 3rd. Shenke, president of the West German "German-Chinese Society," recently published an article in his "New Politics" weekly regarding the Chinese People's Communes, entitled "Eyewitness Report on People's Communes: Viewing China with or without Spectacles." The author refutes the various distortions and slanders of the Chinese People's Communes by Western bourgeois newspapers.

In the article, Shenke introduced a report on the "Economic Significance of Chinese People's Communes" made at a gathering in Hamburg by two West German individuals who had recently visited China: Dr. Breuer of the World Economics Department of Kiel University and Mr. Belling of the Dresdner Bank. In their report, they detailed the great leap forward in various aspects of industry and agriculture in China since the establishment of the People's Communes. Shenke described that when the attendees heard about the tremendous construction achievements made by New China, they almost held their breath.

Shenke emphasized that although "no trace of sympathy for communism" could be found in these two West German individuals, they both unanimously described how the Chinese people were engaged in construction with unparalleled enthusiasm. In his report, Belling also cited his conversations with various people in the People's Communes to demonstrate the joyful mood of the Chinese people.

In the article, Shenke quoted Breuer and Belling to refute the slanders of Western bourgeois newspapers regarding the so-called "elimination of the family." Shenke reminded people to pay attention to the fact that none of the slanderous articles about the People's Communes were written by people who had personally seen the Chinese People's Communes.

Shenke believes that misunderstanding this "development of great significance" in China will "inevitably bring unfavorable consequences to those who observe things with colored glasses."

Shenke's article also praised the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in economic construction, saying that China has "directly stepped into the new era of the atom" from an economically backward country. "Productive forces that have been dormant for hundreds of years have erupted like a volcano." He said, "If the construction achievements made by China in 1958 have already been called a miracle, then the achievements in 1959 will be even greater, and they may not be describable in human language."

    中国人民以无比热情从事建设
    人民公社是有重要意义的发展
    西德“德中协会”会长驳西方报刊对我国的诬蔑
    新华社波恩　3日电　西德“德中协会”会长沈克最近在他所主编的“新政治”周刊上发表了一篇有关中国人民公社的文章，题目是“目击者关于人民公社的报道：带着或不带眼镜看中国”。作者驳斥了西方国家资产阶级报刊对于中国人民公社的各种歪曲和诬蔑。
    沈克在文章中介绍了不久前访问过中国的两位西德人士——基尔大学世界经济系的布雷耳博士和德累斯顿银行的贝林先生——在汉堡一次集会上所作的有关“中国人民公社的经济意义”的报告。他们在报告中详细介绍了中国自从建立人民公社以来在工农业各方面大跃进的情况。沈克描述说，当到会者听到新中国所取得的巨大建设成就时，他们几乎屏住了呼吸。
    沈克强调说，尽管在这两位西德人士的身上“找不到任何同情共产主义的痕迹”，但是他们都一致叙述了中国人民如何怀着无比热情从事建设事业的情况。贝林在报告中还援引了他同人民公社里各种人的谈话来证明中国人民欢欣鼓舞的情绪。
    沈克在文章中引用布雷耳和贝林两人的话来驳斥西方资产阶级报刊关于所谓“消灭家庭”的诬蔑。沈克提醒人们注意这样一个事实：关于人民公社的各种诬蔑性文章没有一篇是由亲眼看到过中国人民公社的人写的。
    沈克认为，对中国这一“有着重要意义的发展”的误解将“必然会给那些带着有色眼镜观察事物的人带来不妙的后果”。
    沈克的文章还赞扬中国人民在经济建设中所取得的辉煌成就说，中国从一个经济上十分落后的国家“直接迈进到了原子的新时代。数百年来沉睡的生产力像火山似地迸发了出来”。他说，“如果中国在1958年这一年里所取得的建设成就已经被称为是一个奇迹的话，那么1959年的成就将更为巨大，它们也许将不是人们的语言所能够形容的。”
