Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, January 26th. On the occasion of Yugoslav President Tito's visit to Ceylon, Ceylon's progressive public opinion emphasized that he was visiting as the President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and at the same time sharply exposed and condemned his revisionist stance.

    The Ceylon People's Socialist Party issued a statement to the press on January 20, on the eve of Yugoslav President Tito's visit to Ceylon, saying, "An irreconcilable struggle against Titoist philosophy is in our own vital interests, because Titoist philosophy has today become the main weapon in the hands of imperialists to undermine the people's anti-imperialist struggle from within."
    The statement said, "We welcome the President of the Yugoslav Republic to visit Ceylon, but we cannot welcome Tito as the Chairman of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, because he is the purveyor of a dangerous philosophy of cooperation with imperialism, disguised in socialist rhetoric." The statement said, "If our country pursues Marshal Tito's policy towards imperialism, it will seriously undermine our people's struggle to liberate our economy and culture from the shackles of imperialism."
    The statement continued, "Because Marshal Tito believes that the world is divided into two 'opposing military-political blocs.' He believes that the anti-imperialist socialist camp is also a war camp."
    The statement said, "Our people cannot accept or tolerate Marshal Tito's logic, because life has taught our people that imperialism exists as a war camp engaged in enslaving and exploiting colonial peoples. The imperialist camp is a camp of war and militarism. The people's camp is a camp of peace and freedom."
    The statement said, "Whoever does not recognize the camp of peace and socialism headed by the Soviet Union as the camp of all forces of peace, national independence, and democracy is not a socialist."
    The "Forum Weekly," published on January 23, published a commentary ridiculing some newspapers that opposed the spirit of Pancha Shila for praising Tito as a "hero." It said that these newspapers have consistently and viciously opposed all forms of communism, so people naturally raise a question: Why do they suddenly find so many virtues in Tito? "Forum Weekly" said that what is interesting to Ceylon observers is that a certain section of the press has consistently opposed the spirit of Pancha Shila, but now it has found new value in it. It said that this is because Tito has expressed hostility towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but has not shown such hostility towards the colonialists of the United States and Britain.
    Prior to this, the Ceylon Communist Party's Tamil newspaper "Pride of the Nation" published an article reiterating the Ceylon Communist Party's opposition to the revisionist stance and policies adopted by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia headed by Tito. The newspaper also pointed out: "Tito is not visiting Ceylon as a representative of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but is making an official visit to the Ceylon government as the head of state of Yugoslavia."

### 锡兰进步舆论揭露铁托的修正主义立场  铁托主义是帝国主义的工具

    锡兰进步舆论揭露铁托的修正主义立场
    铁托主义是帝国主义的工具
    新华社科伦坡26日电　南斯拉夫总统铁托对锡兰的访问，锡兰的进步舆论强调他是作为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的总统来访问的，同时尖锐地揭露和谴责他的修正主义立场。
    锡兰人民社会党在1月20日南斯拉夫总统铁托访问锡兰前夕向报界发表声明说，“对铁托主义哲学进行不调和的斗争是符合我们的切身利益的，因为铁托主义哲学今天已经成为帝国主义者手中从内部来破坏人民反帝斗争的主要武器。”
    声明说，我们欢迎南斯拉夫共和国总统来锡兰访问，但是不能欢迎作为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟主席的铁托，因为他是以社会主义词藻装扮起来的同帝国主义合作的危险哲学的承办者。声明说：“如果我国奉行铁托元帅对帝国主义的政策，那就是严重地破坏我国人民把我国的经济和文化从帝国主义桎梏下解放出来的斗争。”
    声明接着说，“因为铁托元帅认为，世界分成两个‘敌对的军事—政治集团’。他认为，反帝国主义的社会主义阵营也是战争阵营。”
    声明说：“我国人民不能接受和容忍铁托元帅的逻辑，因为生活已经教训了我国人民：帝国主义是作为从事奴役和剥削殖民地人民的战争阵营而存在的。帝国主义阵营是战争和军国主义阵营。人民的阵营是和平和自由的阵营。”
    声明说，“谁不承认以苏联为首的和平和社会主义阵营是和平、民族独立和民主的一切力量的阵营，谁就不是社会主义者。”
    1月23日出版的“论坛周刊”发表评论嘲笑某些反对潘查希拉精神的报纸把铁托捧为“英雄”，它说，这些报纸一贯恶毒地反对一切形式的共产主义，因此人们自然就产生了一个问题：它们为什么突然发觉铁托有那么多长处呢？“论坛周刊”说，使锡兰观察家们感到有趣的事情，就是某一部分报界一贯反对潘查希拉的精神，可是现在却在它身上找到了新的价值。它说，这是因为铁托向苏联和其他社会主义国家表示敌视，而对美英殖民主义者却没有表现出这种敌意。
    在这以前，锡兰共产党泰米尔文报纸“国家之骄傲报”刊载了一篇文章，重申锡兰共产党反对以铁托为首的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟所采取的修正主义立场和政策。这家报纸也指出：“铁托并不是作为南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表访问锡兰，而是作为南斯拉夫国家元首对锡兰政府进行正式访问的。”
