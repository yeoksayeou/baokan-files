Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: News from Hong Kong: The United States and the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities have recently engaged in a fierce struggle. The United States is mobilizing its propaganda tools and pro-American elements in Taiwan to politically attack and divide the Taiwan Kuomintang, with the main slogan of opposing Chiang Kai-shek's third consecutive term as "President," in an attempt to force Chiang Kai-shek to step down.

Article 47 of the so-called "Constitution" passed by the pseudo "National Assembly" convened by the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Nanjing on December 25, 1946, stipulates that the term of office of the "President" and "Vice President" is six years and can only be re-elected once. Chiang Kai-shek's second term as "President" expires on May 19, 1960.

Although the United States and pro-American elements in Taiwan have repeatedly urged Chiang Kai-shek to express his attitude, and even publicly demanded that Chiang Kai-shek "explicitly declare that he will not seek re-election," Chiang Kai-shek and the Taiwan Kuomintang ruling group have always adopted a silent attitude towards this. It was not until December 23 last year that Chiang Kai-shek made a statement, saying that the "Constitution" should not be amended.

The Associated Press and United Press International of the United States immediately seized on Chiang Kai-shek's statement and publicized it extensively, insisting that Chiang Kai-shek's mention of "opposing constitutional amendments" was equivalent to his announcement that he would step down in 1960. American officials also seized the opportunity to applaud. United Press International issued a message from Washington on December 23 last year, saying: "American officials today welcomed Chiang Kai-shek's decision to hand over power in an orderly manner to a successor when his term as president of Nationalist China (Chiang Kai-shek Group) expires in 1960." Hu Shih, a pro-American element who had just returned to Taiwan from the United States, made a big deal out of Chiang Kai-shek's statement, saying that he "raised both hands in favor" of Chiang Kai-shek's speech, calling Chiang Kai-shek "wise." Pro-American newspapers in Hong Kong were particularly excited. The Hong Kong "Truth Daily," which is related to the United States Information Service, bluntly stated that the candidate for the third "President" of the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities must be "someone who meets the expectations of friendly countries (referring to the United States), at least someone who is physically strong, not an old man (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) suffering from a chronic illness." Well-informed sources in Hong Kong pointed out that the United States has recently been looking for various opportunities to kick Chiang Kai-shek aside and use extreme pro-American factions to realize the United States' plan to "trusteeship Taiwan." American news agencies have recently made no secret of this conspiracy in their reports. The Associated Press said, "Chiang Kai-shek's decision to get rid of political affairs is the beginning of ending the 'two Chinas' problem," and "Formosa (Taiwan) may be neutralized under the guarantee of the United Nations." It also said that "once this seventy-two-year-old Kuomintang leader (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) retires," the United States will find the issue of trusteeship of Taiwan "easier to handle."

The United States' anti-Chiang activities have aroused great vigilance from Chiang Kai-shek and the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities. A group of powerful "National Assembly representatives" in the Taiwan Kuomintang are actively working to enable Chiang Kai-shek to serve a third consecutive term as "President." At a recent "National Assembly Representatives Annual Meeting" in Taiwan, many "representatives" suggested passing some "temporary measures" at the meeting to ensure that Chiang Kai-shek would continue to serve as "President." Some senior Kuomintang officials have countered the American anti-Chiang propaganda, repeatedly declaring their support for Chiang Kai-shek to continue as "President" and saying that Chiang Kai-shek himself has not refused to continue as "President."

The United States' wrecking activities against the Taiwan Kuomintang have also become more rampant than before in utilizing the so-called "free Chinese elements" and "Taiwan independence elements" in Taiwan and Hong Kong. These pro-American and anti-Chiang elements have recently, under the instructions of the Americans, put forward a so-called "Taiwan democratization" plan, launching a fierce attack on Chiang Kai-shek, shouting "Anti-communism must first be anti-Chiang," advocating that the United States "adopt new methods in Taiwan other than military and economic assistance, and implement a new political, cultural, and moral assistance program," to "liberate" Taiwan from "dictatorial rule in order to establish a new democratic and free political order." "Free China Half-Monthly," published in Taiwan by pro-American figures Hu Shih, Lei Chen, etc., reflecting news from Washington, also published editorials scolding the Three Principles of the People, saying that nationalism is "narrow and conceited nationalism," and scolding the Taiwan authorities for emphasizing "national spirit" as a "bewitching trick" to deceive young people's minds, which does not conform to the intentions of the United States "ally."

At present, this sharp struggle between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek Group is still developing.

### 美蒋矛盾有新发展  美国要迫蒋介石下台  指使台湾亲美分子大搞拆台活动

    美蒋矛盾有新发展
    美国要迫蒋介石下台
    指使台湾亲美分子大搞拆台活动
    新华社广州7日电　香港消息：美国同台湾国民党当局最近展开了一场剧烈的斗争。美国调动它的宣传工具和台湾的亲美分子从政治上打击和分化台湾国民党，以反对蒋介石第三次连任“总统”为主要口号，企图迫使蒋介石下台。
    蒋介石集团于1946年12月25日在南京召开的伪“国民大会”通过的所谓“宪法”第四十七条规定，“总统”“副总统”的任期为六年，只能连选连任一次。蒋介石第二届的“总统”任期至1960年5月19日期满。
    虽然美国方面和台湾的亲美分子，一再催迫蒋介石表示态度，甚至公开要蒋介石“明白宣示不再连任”，蒋介石和台湾国民党统治集团对此一直采取缄默的态度。直到去年12月23日，蒋介石才发表谈话，表示“宪法”不应当修改。
    美国的美联社和合众国际社立即抓住蒋介石这句话大肆宣传，硬说蒋介石提到“反对修改宪法”就等于他宣布自己在1960年下台。美国官员也抓住这个机会赶忙拍手叫好。合众国际社在去年12月23日从华盛顿发出一则消息说：“美国官员今天欢迎蒋介石关于在他的国民党中国（蒋介石集团）总统任期于1960年届满时把权力有条不紊地移交给一个继任者的决定。”从美国回到台湾不久的亲美分子胡适抓住蒋介石这句话大做文章，胡适说，他对蒋介石的讲话“举起双手赞成”，说蒋介石“明智”。香港的亲美报纸尤其兴高采烈。与美国新闻处有关的香港“真报”露骨地说，台湾国民党当局的第三届“总统”继任的人选，必须是“符合友邦（指美国）期望的人，至少是体魄健旺，而不是带病延年的老人（指蒋介石）”。香港的消息灵通人士指出：近来美国正在找寻各种可乘之机，以便把蒋介石一脚踢开，并且利用极端亲美派，来实现美国“托管台湾”的计划。美国通讯社在最近一个时期的报道中，已经不再讳言美国的这一阴谋。美联社说，“蒋介石要摆脱政务的决定，是结束‘两个中国’问题的开端”，“福摩萨（台湾）可能在联合国保证下中立化”。它还说，“一旦这个七十二岁的国民党领袖（指蒋介石）退职后”，美国对托管台湾问题“就比较容易处理了”。
    美国的倒蒋活动，已引起蒋介石和台湾国民党当局很大的戒心。台湾国民党一批有势力的“国大代表”正在积极活动，使蒋介石可以连任第三届“总统”。在不久前召开的一次台湾“国大代表年会”上，许多“代表”在会上建议通过一些“临时措施”，保证蒋介石继续连任“总统”。有些国民党高级官员对美国的倒蒋宣传进行了反击，他们一再声言拥护蒋介石继续当“总统”，并且说蒋介石本人并没有拒绝继续连任“总统”的表示。
    美国对台湾国民党的拆台活动，在利用台湾和香港等地的所谓“自由中国分子”和“台湾独立分子”方面，也比以前更加猖獗了。这些亲美反蒋分子近来在美国人的授意下，提出所谓“台湾民主化”的方案，对蒋介石展开猛烈攻击，大叫“反共必先反蒋”，主张美国在台湾“采取军经援助以外的新办法，实行一种政治、文化与道德的新援助计划”，由美国把台湾“从独裁统治下解放，以建立一个民主自由的新政治秩序”。反映华盛顿方面消息的、由亲美分子胡适、雷震等在台湾出版的“自由中国半月刊”，还发表社论漫骂三民主义，说民族主义是“狭隘而妄自尊大的民族主义”，责骂台湾当局强调“民族精神”是蒙蔽青年思想的“迷魂招”，不符合美国“盟友”的意旨。
    目前，美国和蒋介石集团之间这场尖锐的斗争，仍在继续发展。
