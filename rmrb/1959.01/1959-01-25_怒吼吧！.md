Roar!

Salute to the heroic Cuban people who are overthrowing the dictatorial rule that betrays national interests, striving to get rid of the brutal plunder of American monopoly capital, and opposing American interference in internal affairs!

Salute to the Congolese people who demand independence and oppose colonialism!

I have been to several countries in Latin America, and also passed through the African continent and its coast. I also know some peace-loving people, poets and writers from these countries. Hearing the powerful, resolute and courageous struggle of the Cuban people and the just demands of the Congolese people is like hearing roars from Havana Square and the banks of the Congo River, which makes me feel particularly excited! All of us Chinese people have great sympathy for the struggle for freedom and independence of the various countries and nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and are willing to give it our full support. Because we ourselves have suffered the same hardships imposed on us by imperialism and colonialism. Almost ten years after the nationwide liberation, the American imperialists are still arrogantly occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan. We and the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries have a common enemy with whom we cannot coexist. Let us unite with the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and fight resolutely and hand in hand with the imperialists and colonialists in the final struggle! In today's world where the forces of peace and democracy are constantly growing stronger, and the national liberation movement is flourishing, in today's world where the East wind prevails over the West wind, and "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day," the Cuban and Congolese people, and all oppressed people, are bound to win the final victory!

    怒吼吧！
    萧三
    向打倒出卖民族利益的独裁统治、争取摆脱美国垄断资本的残酷掠夺、反对美国干涉内政的英勇的古巴人民致敬！
    向要求独立、反对殖民主义的刚果人民致敬！
    我到过拉丁美洲的几个国家，也经过非洲大陆和海岸；我也认识这些国家的一些和平人士与诗人作家，听到古巴人民声势浩大、坚决勇敢的斗争和刚果人民的正义要求，就如同听到了从哈瓦那广场和刚果河畔发出的吼声，特别感觉得兴奋！我们全体中国人民对于亚洲非洲和拉丁美洲各个国家民族争取自由独立的斗争，都寄予极大的同情，愿意给以全力的支持。因为我们自己就经受过同样的帝国主义和殖民主义强加在我们身上的苦难。全国解放将近十年了，美帝国主义者仍然蛮横无理地霸占着我们的神圣领土台湾，我们和古巴人民以及拉丁美洲各国人民有着不共戴天的共同敌人。让我们和亚、非、美洲各国被压迫的人民团结起来，手携手肩并肩地向帝国主义者和殖民主义者作坚决的最后的斗争吧！在这和平民主力量不断壮大、民族解放运动蓬勃发展的今天，在这东风压倒西风，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的今天，古巴和刚果人民，一切被压迫的人民是一定能获得最后的胜利的！
