Xinhua News Agency Report: At the Soviet Communist Party's Twenty-First Congress on the afternoon of January 28th and the morning of January 29th, representatives from fraternal parties of Italy, France, and other countries delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, conveyed fraternal and warm congratulations to the Congress delegates on behalf of the Italian Communists and Communist Youth League members at the afternoon session on January 28th. He emphasized that they were watching the development of the Soviet Union with love and gratitude. He said that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan opened up magnificent and splendid prospects not only before you, but also before the working class and all of humanity around the world. While conquering the universe, you are also attracting the hearts and minds of all mankind.

You have issued a new challenge to the decadent imperialism. Thanks to your efforts, the efforts of the communist movement and the workers' movement, and the efforts of the great People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries that are building a new life, you will achieve victory.

Togliatti emphasized that the united action of the working class and democratic forces is a necessary condition to block the path of fascist and reactionary forces. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the principles declared in the 1957 Moscow Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties are of great significance to the entire international communist movement.

He said that we fully endorse the principles of mutual relations between communist and workers' parties of all countries as elucidated in Comrade Khrushchev's report to the Twenty-First Congress of the CPSU. The path of history is not predetermined. The people of each country have their own national characteristics, and the workers' parties should be good at promoting these characteristics in their activities.

Togliatti analyzed the domestic situation in Italy and said that we will do our best to make the greatest contribution of the Italian working class to the struggle for peace and socialism. He said that for all of us, the great Soviet Communist Party is an example of unwavering loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, spoke at the afternoon session of the Congress. Duclos expressed warm congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the French Communist Party and its Central Committee, as well as the French working class and the working masses. He stressed that the Congress was being held in an atmosphere of encouraging victory. Duclos pointed out the achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology. He said that by launching an artificial planet to the sun, the Soviet people have realized the ideals of mankind for generations, eloquently showing the world the creativity of socialism.

He said that the balance of world forces has become favorable to the socialist system. The powerful Soviet Union, together with People's China and other countries in the socialist camp, is now a magnificent force.

Duclos then described in detail the current situation in France, and the difficulties encountered by the working people of France under the anti-democratic measures rampant in the country. He also introduced the activities of the French Communist Party. He emphasized that the French Communist Party is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

Duclos emphasized that while attending your Congress of great significance, we are filled with greater confidence in the victory of our great cause. We are proud to be communists, fighters for communism and for the hope and future of all mankind.

At the morning session on January 29th, Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, delivered a speech. He said that our party has always regarded the Soviet Communist Party as a long-tested mentor. In recent times, the achievements of our work have been achieved on the basis of the conclusions we drew from the summary of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. We have further consolidated the unity of the party, strengthened the party's ties with the people, and brought into play the creativity of the working people. Novotný said that it is precisely because of this that we were able to put forward the task of completing socialist construction in Czechoslovakia at the 11th Congress of our Party.

Novotný pointed out that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan control figures are not only of great significance to the Soviet Union and to the socialist camp, but also of great significance to the whole world. Khrushchev's report outline helps in many ways to formulate Czechoslovakia's development plan.

Novotný said that today, the whole world has seen with its own eyes that the Soviet Union has achieved an advantage in many aspects, especially in science and technology. The Soviet Union will take the first place in the world in all decisive indicators (including production volume and living standards of residents) in a relatively short period of time. In the near future, the world socialist system will also absolutely surpass capitalism in material production.

Novotný emphasized that the Soviet example, its rich experience and selfless assistance, and the Soviet Union's growing international prestige, are now and will remain the main factors for the vigorous development of the world socialist system.

When talking about the close cooperation between socialist camp countries, Novotný said that the relations between our countries are built on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism. The content of our relationship is to strengthen unity and cooperation in order to build socialism and communism in all socialist countries, and to achieve victory in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a speech at the morning session on January 29th. He said that the program for the comprehensive development of communist society put forward in Khrushchev's report is of great significance to the entire international workers' movement. The declaration of the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties of all countries adopted in November 1957 consolidated the internal socialist camp and especially helped Germany, which is at the forefront of the socialist world in the west, to carry out the struggle for peace and socialist transformation.

Ulbricht continued by saying that the domestic task of the German people lies in learning from the lessons of the two world wars and stopping the revanchists and militarists of West Germany. Germany, located in the center of Western Europe, can only exist as a peaceful and democratic country. Khrushchev's proposals in his report on solving the German problem and the Berlin problem are in line with the national interests of the German people and the task of maintaining German peace. The peace conference suggested by the Soviet Union will promote the solution of this problem. A peace treaty with Germany will open the door to a peaceful future for Germany. It is, to some extent, the link that facilitates the union of the two Germanys.

Ulbricht said that the working people of the German Democratic Republic, together with the people in West Germany who oppose atomic war, are doing their best to change the policies of West Germany. It goes without saying that in order to implement a peaceful policy, it is necessary to further strengthen the workers' and peasants' regime in the German Democratic Republic and unswervingly carry out socialist transformation.

Ulbricht concluded by saying: We listened to Khrushchev's report with great interest. We believe that the principles he elucidated in theoretical and practical issues are a highly creative contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory. Due to our fraternal cooperation in socialist division of labor and collaboration, we will certainly be able to fulfill our responsibilities in the great camp of socialist countries.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, delivered a speech at the morning session on January 29th. He said that the bold and extremely realistic goals put forward in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan not only inspire the peoples of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, but also have a far-reaching impact on the lives of all socialist countries and all of humanity. Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Soviet people led by the Soviet Communist Party have won respect and love. It moves along a path that no one has walked before and paves and points out the way for the people of all countries to build a communist society.

Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that Khrushchev's report put forward the argument on the two stages of communism and the methods of establishing the material and technical foundation of communism is of great significance. He emphasized that all the issues raised in the report of the 21st Congress of the CPSU are of great significance to all communist and workers' parties, all socialist countries, and the entire international communist movement.

Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out the unity of the communist and workers' party forces, and also pointed out the bankruptcy of all attempts by revisionists to slander Marxism. He emphasized that the views and practices of the Yugoslav revisionists run counter to the interests of socialism and serve the interests of the reactionaries. He pointed out that the representatives of fraternal communist and workers' parties from all continents attended the 21st Congress, once again demonstrating their unity under the victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism.

János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a speech at the morning session on January 29th. He congratulated the Congress on behalf of the Hungarian Communists and expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people for the fraternal assistance they gave to the Hungarian people in 1956 in the struggle against the bourgeois-landlord reactionaries and the international imperialist forces that incited the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary. Kádár said that the Soviet people, China, and the people of the socialist camp countries supported us in this struggle in the spirit of internationalism. Kádár spoke about the domestic situation in Hungary. He pointed out that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian working people are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the people of the socialist camp countries for peace and socialism. He emphasized that the friendship between Hungary and the Soviet Union has not weakened but has become more consolidated. He said that the 21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party has increased our new strength. The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will not only be a victory for the Soviet people, but also a victory for the forces of peace and the entire socialist camp.

    苏联七年计划吸引着全人类的心灵
    意法捷德罗匈等国兄弟党代表向大会热烈致贺
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会28日下午和29日上午会议上，意大利、法国等国兄弟党代表先后向大会致贺词。意大利共产党中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂在28日下午会议上代表意大利共产党员和共青团员向大会代表转达了兄弟般的热烈祝贺。他强调说，他们以热爱和感激的心情注视着苏联的发展。他说，苏联的七年计划不仅在你们面前，而且也在全世界工人阶级和全人类面前打开了宏伟和灿烂的前景。你们在征服宇宙的同时，也在吸引全人类的心灵和思想。
    你们向腐朽的帝国主义发出了新的挑战，由于你们的努力，由于共产主义运动和工人运动的努力，由于正在建设新生活的伟大中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的努力，你们将取得胜利。
    陶里亚蒂强调说，工人阶级和民主力量的行动统一是堵塞法西斯和反动势力道路的必要条件。苏共第二十次代表大会决议和1957年共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言宣布的原则对整个国际共产主义运动具有重大意义。
    他说，我们完全拥护赫鲁晓夫同志向苏共第二十一次代表大会提出的报告中所阐明的各国共产党和工人党之间相互关系的原则。历史的道路不是预先规定的。每个国家的人民都有本民族的特点，而工人阶级政党在自己的活动中应当善于发扬这些特点。
    陶里亚蒂分析了意大利国内的局势，并且说，我们将全力以赴，使意大利工人阶级对争取和平与社会主义的斗争作出最大的贡献。他说，对我们大家来说，伟大的苏联共产党是坚定不移地忠于马克思列宁主义原则的榜样。
    法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛在下午的大会上讲话。杜克洛代表法国共产党和它的中央委员会以及法国工人阶级和劳动群众向代表大会表示热烈祝贺。他强调指出，这次代表大会是在令人鼓舞的胜利气氛中举行的。杜克洛指出了苏联在科学技术方面的成就。他说，由于向太阳发射了人造行星，苏联人实现了人类世世代代的理想，雄辩地向全世界表明社会主义的创造力。
    他说，世界力量的对比已经变得有利于社会主义体系。现在强大的苏维埃国家同人民中国和社会主义阵营其他国家一道是一支宏伟的力量。
    杜克洛接着详细地叙述了法国当前局势，叙述了在法国国内反民主措施横行的情况下法国劳动人民所遭遇到的困难。他还介绍了法国共产党的活动。他强调说，法国共产党忠于马克思列宁主义原则。
    杜克洛着重说，在出席你们这次具有重大意义的代表大会的时候，我们对我们伟大的事业的胜利充满了更大的信心，我们以自己是共产党人、是为共产主义、为全人类的希望和未来而斗争的战士而自豪。
    在29日上午会议上，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼致词。他说，我们党一直认为苏联共产党是久经考验的导师。最近时期，我们工作的成就便是依据我们从苏共第二十次代表大会总结中作出的结论来取得的。我们已经进一步巩固了党的团结，加强了党同人民的联系，发挥了劳动人民的创造性。诺沃提尼说，正因为如此，我们才能够在我们党的第十一次代表大会上提出在捷克斯洛伐克完成社会主义建设的任务。
    诺沃提尼指出，苏联七年计划控制数字不仅对苏联和对社会主义阵营有着重大的意义，而且对全世界也有着巨大意义。赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲在许多方面有助于拟定捷克斯洛伐克的发展计划。
    诺沃提尼说，今天，全世界都已经亲眼看到，苏联在许多方面，首先是科学技术方面取得了优势。苏联将在比较短的时期内在一切决定性的指标（包括生产量和居民生活水平）方面跃居世界第一位。不久的将来，世界社会主义体系将在物质生产方面也绝对超过资本主义。
    诺沃提尼强调说，苏联的榜样，它的丰富的经验和无私的援助，苏联日益增长的国际威望，现在是，将来仍然是世界社会主义体系蓬勃发展的主要因素。
    诺沃提尼在谈到社会主义阵营各国密切合作时说，我们各国之间的关系是建筑在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的。我们之间关系的内容是：为了在所有社会主义国家中建成社会主义和共产主义，为了在社会主义和资本主义的经济竞赛中取得胜利而加强团结和合作。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在29日上午会议上致词。他说，赫鲁晓夫报告中提出的全面展开共产主义社会建设的纲领，对整个国际工人运动有着巨大意义。1957年11月所通过的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言，使社会主义阵营的内部巩固了，特别帮助了处在社会主义世界西部最前哨的德国进行争取和平和社会主义改造的斗争。
    乌布利希接着说，德国人民的国内任务在于，吸取两次世界大战的教训并制止西德的复仇主义者和军国主义者。位于西欧中心的德国只有作为一个和平民主的国家才能存在。赫鲁晓夫在报告中所提的关于解决德国问题和柏林问题的建议，符合德国人民的民族利益和维护德国和平的任务。苏联建议召开的和会将会促进这一问题的解决。对德和约将打开通向德国和平的未来的大门。它在某种程度上是促使两个德国联结的环节。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国劳动人民同西德反对原子战争的人们一道竭尽全力地争取改变西德的政策。不言而喻，为了执行和平政策，必须进一步加强德意志民主共和国的工农政权和坚持不渝地进行社会主义改造。
    乌布利希最后说：我们以很大的兴趣听取了赫鲁晓夫的报告。我们认为，他在理论和实践问题方面所阐明的原理是对马克思列宁主义理论的极有创造性的贡献。由于我们在社会主义分工和协作方面进行了兄弟合作，我们一定能履行自己在社会主义国家伟大阵营中的职责。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治在29日上午会议上致词。他说，苏联七年计划中所提出的豪迈而极为现实的目标，不仅鼓舞着苏联各族人民，而且对所有社会主义国家和全人类的生活有着深远的影响。乔治乌—德治说，苏联共产党所领导的苏联人民赢得了尊敬和爱戴，它沿着前人所没有走过的道路前进，给各国人民铺平和指出了建设共产主义社会的道路。
    乔治乌—德治指出，赫鲁晓夫报告中提出的关于共产主义的两个阶段和建立共产主义物质技术基础的方法的论点具有重要意义。他强调说，苏共第二十一次代表大会的报告中所提出的所有问题对各个共产党和工人党、各个社会主义国家和整个国际共产主义运动都有着巨大意义。
    乔治乌—德治指出共产党和工人党力量的团结，同时也指出修正主义者诽谤马克思主义的一切企图的破产。他强调指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者的观点和实践违背社会主义的利益并且为反动派的利益服务。他指出，各大洲的兄弟共产党和工人党代表出席第二十一次代表大会，再一次显示了它们在马克思列宁主义战无不胜的旗帜下的团结一致。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔在29日上午会议上致词。他代表匈牙利共产党人向代表大会表示祝贺，并对苏联共产党和苏联人民表示感谢，感谢他们1956年在反对资产阶级——地主反动派和在匈牙利煽动反革命叛乱的国际帝国主义势力的斗争中给予匈牙利人民的兄弟援助。卡达尔说，苏联人民、中国以及社会主义阵营各国人民本着国际主义的精神，在这场斗争中支援了我们。卡达尔谈到了匈牙利的国内情况。他指出，匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利劳动人民同社会主义阵营各国的人民肩并肩地为争取和平和社会主义而斗争。他强调指出，匈牙利同苏联的友情不仅没有减弱，而且更加巩固了。他说，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会给我们增加了新的力量。七年计划的实现将不仅是苏联人民的胜利，而且也是和平力量和整个社会主义阵营的胜利。
