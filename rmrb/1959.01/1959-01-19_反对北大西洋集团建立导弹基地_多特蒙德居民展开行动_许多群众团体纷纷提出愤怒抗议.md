Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th - Residents of Dortmund, West Germany, are firmly opposed to turning Dortmund into a missile base.

According to the plans of the North Atlantic Group's command, the British 47th Missile Regiment, equipped with American-made "Corporal" surface-to-surface missiles, will be stationed in Dortmund in February.

As soon as this decision was announced by the West German Ministry of Defense, it immediately aroused angry protests from more than 600,000 residents of Dortmund. The city council of this city unanimously passed a resolution on the 17th, denouncing the decision to station a British missile regiment in Dortmund. Even city councilors belonging to Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union supported this resolution.

The resolution pointed out that the decision to allow the British missile regiment to enter Dortmund has "caused great unease among the residents of Dortmund." The resolution stated that the residents of Dortmund do not feel protected by the stationing of the missile regiment; on the contrary, they all feel that it has increased the danger of war.

The resolution requested the mayor of Dortmund to meet with West German government authorities and the British Ambassador to West Germany to request that they revoke this decision.

A protest letter issued by the Dortmund local organization of the West German Trade Union Federation pointed out that the establishment of a missile base is the greatest threat to the residents of Dortmund and the surrounding areas.

The Dortmund Association Against Military Service held a mass meeting for this purpose. The meeting passed a resolution calling on all residents of Dortmund, city administrative bodies, and organizations to resolutely oppose the establishment of a missile base.

The Dortmund "Committee Against Atomic Death Struggle" and the German Social Democratic Party organization in Asseln (near Dortmund) also expressed serious protests against the establishment of a missile base in the Dortmund area.

Dortmund is the central city of the Ruhr industrial area. Most of the city's buildings were destroyed by aircraft during World War II.

    反对北大西洋集团建立导弹基地
    多特蒙德居民展开行动
    许多群众团体纷纷提出愤怒抗议
    新华社18日讯　波恩消息：西德多特蒙德居民坚决反对把多特蒙德变成导弹基地。
    根据北大西洋集团司令部的计划，装备着美国制造的“下士”式地—地导弹的英国第四十七导弹团，将在2月间驻扎到多特蒙德去。
    这个决定一经西德国防部宣布，马上引起了多特蒙德六十多万居民的愤怒抗议。这个城市的市议会17日一致通过决议，指责在多特蒙德驻扎英国导弹团的决定。甚至属于阿登纳基督教民主联盟的市议员也支持这个决议。
    决议指出，关于让英国导弹团进驻多特蒙德的决定已经“引起多特蒙德居民的极大不安”，决议说，多特蒙德居民并不因为驻扎导弹团而感到受到保护，相反，他们都因此而感到增加了战争危险。
    决议要求多特蒙德市长去见西德政府当局和英国驻西德大使，向他们提出撤销这个决定的要求。
    西德工会联合会多特蒙德地方组织发表的抗议书指出，建立导弹基地是对多特蒙德和附近地区居民的最大威胁。
    多特蒙德反对服兵役联合会为此召开了群众大会。大会通过决议，呼吁多特蒙德的全体居民，市管理机构和各团体坚决反对建立导弹基地。
    多特蒙德“反对原子死亡斗争委员会”以及阿塞林市（多特蒙德附近）德国社会民主党组织也对在多特蒙德地区建立导弹基地表示严重抗议。
    多特蒙德是鲁尔工业区的中心城市。这个城市的大部分建筑曾经在第二次世界大战中被飞机炸毁。
