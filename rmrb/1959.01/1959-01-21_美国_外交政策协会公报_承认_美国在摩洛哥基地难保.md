The U.S. "Foreign Policy Association Bulletin" recently published an article providing a comprehensive discussion of the awkward situation of the United States regarding its bases in Morocco.

The article, entitled "Morocco and American Bases," admits that the establishment of U.S. bases in Morocco has no legal basis. The author points out that "the United States, with the consent of the French when they ruled Morocco, built a naval base and four air bases in Morocco. The status of these bases became problematic from 1956, the date of Morocco's independence. The Franco-American agreement on the bases was not submitted to King Mohammed V of Morocco for approval, so Moroccan nationalists do not recognize the legitimacy of the agreement and do not consider it to be related to an independent Morocco."

In negotiations with Morocco on the base issue, the United States used tactics of threats and inducements in an attempt to force Morocco to compromise. The author points out that the United States once offered to "help" Morocco "stabilize and develop its economy" in exchange for the United States continuing to maintain its base rights. At the same time, the United States has repeatedly joined France in putting pressure on Morocco. However, these methods have failed to make Morocco abandon its position of national independence.

Over the past year, the situation has changed even more dramatically. "Not only has the hope of maintaining American bases in Morocco disappeared, but there is also a risk that Morocco may break away from the United States and the West. The sharp deterioration of Morocco's economic situation, its increasing political instability, and the impact of events in France, Algeria, and the Near East have all accelerated the formation of this new situation."

Through the struggle over the base issue, the Moroccan people have become increasingly clear about the true face of the United States. The author of "Morocco and American Bases" admits: "In the past year, Moroccans have increasingly regarded American bases as the same as French troops, Spanish troops, and other remnants of 'colonialism'." "Moroccans' attitude towards these bases is different from that of American officials. Talking about 'free world defense' with Moroccans is absurd, because they do not agree with our belief in the threat of international communism. In recent years, the Moroccan government has stated that its policy is one of 'international free cooperation and independence'. According to the weekly 'Independence,' the organ of the major Moroccan party (the Istiqlal Party), 'the existence of American bases is incompatible with Morocco's policy of independence'."

In recent negotiations with Morocco, the United States has been forced to make formal concessions, agreeing in principle to withdraw the bases, but requiring a period of five to seven years for "preparations" before withdrawing. However, this tactic has also failed to deceive the Moroccan people. On November 18, 1958, Morocco called for the "complete and unconditional" removal of these bases.

The author of "Morocco and American Bases" fears that the just struggle of the Moroccan people will have a chain reaction in other countries. He says: "The problem of American bases is not limited to Morocco alone. The removal of bases in one region of the world will almost certainly have an impact on bases in other regions. However, ignoring the growing dissatisfaction of residents in countries with American military bases may cause even greater misfortune in foreign policy."

### 美国“外交政策协会公报”承认  美国在摩洛哥基地难保

    美国“外交政策协会公报”承认
    美国在摩洛哥基地难保
    本报讯　最近一期的美国“外交政策协会公报”发表文章就美国在摩洛哥基地问题上的尴尬处境作了全面的论述。
    这篇以“摩洛哥和美国基地”为题的文章承认，美国在摩洛哥建立基地是没有法律根据的。文章作者指出，“美国在法国人统治摩洛哥的时候得到法国的同意在摩洛哥建筑了一个海军基地和四个空军基地，这些基地的地位从1956年，即摩洛哥获得独立之日起就成问题了。法美关于基地的协定没有提交摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世批准，因此摩洛哥民族主义分子不承认协定的合法性，不认为它同独立的摩洛哥有联系。”
    美国在和摩洛哥进行基地问题的谈判中，曾经使用了威胁利诱的手法，企图迫使摩洛哥妥协。作者指出，美国曾经以“帮助”摩洛哥“稳定和发展它的经济”为条件以换取美国继续保持基地的权利。同时，美国曾多次联合法国一道向摩洛哥施加压力。但是，这些手法都未能使摩洛哥放弃民族独立的立场。
    最近一年来，情况已发生了更大的变化。“不仅在摩洛哥保持美国基地的希望消失了，并且还出现了摩洛哥可能脱离美国和西方的危险。摩洛哥经济状况剧烈恶化，它的政治越来越不稳定以及法国、阿尔及利亚和近东事件的影响，这种种情况加速了这种新局面的形成。”
    通过基地问题的斗争，摩洛哥人民已经越来越清楚地认识了美国的真正面目。“摩洛哥和美国基地”的作者承认：“最近一年来摩洛哥人越来越把美国的基地同法国军队、西班牙军队和‘殖民主义’的其他残余看作一回事了。”“摩洛哥人对待这些基地的态度是和美国负责人不一样的。同摩洛哥人谈‘自由世界防务’是荒谬的，因为他们不同意我们相信的国际共产主义威胁。最近几年摩洛哥政府说明自己的政策是‘国际自由合作和独立’的政策。据摩洛哥大政党（独立党）的机关报‘独立’周刊说，‘美国基地的存在是同摩洛哥的独立政策不相容的’。”
    美国在同摩洛哥最近举行的谈判中，已经被迫作了形式上的让步，原则上同意撤除基地，但是在撤退以前，需要五年到七年期限来进行“准备工作”。但是，这种手法也未能骗倒摩洛哥人民。1958年11月18日摩洛哥呼吁要求“彻底和无条件地”撤除这些基地。
      “摩洛哥和美国基地”的作者担心摩洛哥人民的正义斗争会在其他国家产生连锁反应。他说：“美国基地的问题不只限于摩洛哥一处。撤除世界一个地区的基地，几乎不用怀疑会对其他地区的基地发生影响。但是，如果不顾有美国军事基地的各国居民日益增长的不满情绪，也许会在外交政策方面引起更大的不幸”。
