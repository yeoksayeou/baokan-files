    China's economic circles have had many debates on the issue of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system in the past. The content and arguments of the debates mainly involve the following three aspects:
    I. There are three different views on why commodity production should be preserved under the socialist system. The first view is: because there exist two forms of socialist ownership: ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Commodities are products that are mutually bought and sold between different owners. Without the existence of different ownership systems, there would be no economic conditions for commodity production.
    The second view is: because the principle of distribution according to labor must be implemented under the socialist system. As long as social products are not rich enough, the state must distribute personal consumer goods through commodity-currency forms; otherwise, it will be difficult to organize normal economic life. Even after the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, distribution according to labor cannot be immediately transitioned to distribution according to need, and commodity-currency relations cannot be immediately eliminated.
    The third view is: the existence of two forms of ownership, the existence of distribution according to labor, and the implementation of economic accounting systems in state-owned enterprises are all prerequisites for the existence of commodity production.
    II. There are two opinions on whether the means of production are commodities. One opinion is: roughly agreeing with Stalin's statement. When the means of production are transferred from one state-owned enterprise to another, the ownership system does not change, and in essence, they are not commodities, only preserving the outer shell of commodities in form.
    Another opinion is: the means of production are commodities not only in form but also in substance. A commodity is a product that has use value and is produced for exchange. With the existence of the social division of labor, there is also the existence of commodity production. Under the socialist system, there is still a social division of labor within state-owned enterprises. The transfer of a product from one state-owned enterprise to another still belongs to the nature of exchange. Although the enterprises transferring the product and the enterprises receiving the product are both state-owned, they are relatively independent enterprises. The internal transfer relationship of the means of production is essentially an economic relationship of commodity exchange.
    III. Regarding the role of the law of value. One opinion believes that after the completion of China's socialist transformation, the law of value only plays a regulatory role in the field of circulation and only plays a certain influencing role in the field of production. The reason is: under the socialist system, the development of production is mainly affected by the basic socialist economic law, the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy, and state planning regulation. The fact that the state does not first develop the more profitable light industry but first develops the less profitable heavy industry is because the law of value does not play a regulatory role in the field of production.
    Another opinion believes that the law of value also plays a regulatory role in the field of production. The reason is: under the socialist system, the development of productive forces is not very high, and there are still contradictions between social needs and commodity supply. The state cannot plan the supply and demand of thousands of commodities one by one, and it also needs to use the regulation of the law of value. When formulating plans, it is also necessary to consider the value of commodities, price levels, and their supply-demand relationship. The regulatory role of the law of value in the field of circulation actually regulates production through the market.
    Some people, although generally agreeing that the law of value also has a regulatory effect on production, only limit this regulatory effect to the scope of light industry and agricultural production. As for the production of the means of production, they believe that it has no regulatory effect. Their opinion is based on the premise that the means of production are not commodities.
    Some people oppose this view, believing that the production of the means of production is also regulated by the law of value.

### 我国经济学界对商品生产和价值规律的几个论点

    我国经济学界对商品生产和价值规律的几个论点
    我国经济学界对于社会主义制度下的商品生产和价值规律问题，过去曾经有过不少争论。争论的内容和论点主要有以下三个方面。
    一、社会主义制度下为什么要保存商品生产，有三种不同的见解。第一种见解是：因为社会主义制度下存在着全民所有制和集体所有制。商品是不同所有者之间相互买卖的产品。没有不同的所有制存在，就没有商品生产的经济条件。
  第二种见解是：因为社会主义制度下要实行按劳分配的原则。只要社会产品还不够丰富，国家就要通过商品货币形式来分配个人消费品，否则难于组织正常的经济生活。即使在集体所有制过渡到全民所有制以后，按劳分配也不能马上过渡到按需分配，商品货币关系也不能马上消灭。
    第三种见解是：两种所有制的存在，按劳分配关系的存在，以及国营企业实行经济核算制，都是商品生产存在的前提。
    二、生产资料是不是商品，有两种意见。一种意见是：大体上同意斯大林的说法。生产资料由一个国营企业拨交另一个国营企业，不改变所有制，实质上不是商品，只在形式上保存商品的外壳。
    另一种意见是：生产资料不仅在形式上而且在实质上也是商品。商品是具有使用价值，同时是为了交换的产品。有社会分工的存在，也就有商品生产的存在。在社会主义制度下，国营企业内部仍然存在着社会分工。一个国营企业的产品调拨给其他国营企业，仍然属于交换性质。调出产品的企业和调入产品的企业，虽然都是国家的，但他们都是相对独立的企业。生产资料的内部调拨关系，实质上也是一种商品交换的经济关系。
    三、关于价值规律的作用问题。一种意见认为，我国社会主义改造完成以后，价值规律只在流通领域内起调节作用，在生产领域内只起一定的影响作用。理由是：在社会主义制度下，生产的发展主要是受社会主义基本经济规律、国民经济有计划（按比例）发展规律和国家计划调节的。国家不首先发展赢利较多的轻工业，而首先发展赢利较少的重工业，就是因为价值规律在生产领域内不起调节作用。
    另一种意见认为，价值规律在生产领域也起调节作用。理由是：在社会主义制度下，生产力的发展还不很高，社会需要和商品供应之间还有矛盾。国家不可能把成千上万种商品的供需量一一加以计划，还需要借助价值规律的调节。在制定计划的时候，也要考虑到商品的价值、价格水平和它们的供求关系。价值规律在流通领域的调节作用，实际上也是通过市场调节生产。
    另有一些人虽然一般地同意价值规律对生产也有调节作用，但是只把这种调节作用限于轻工业和农业的生产范围以内，至于对生产资料的生产，认为是没有调节作用的。他们的这种意见是以生产资料不是商品为前提的。
    有些人反对这种看法，认为生产资料的生产也是受价值规律调节的。
