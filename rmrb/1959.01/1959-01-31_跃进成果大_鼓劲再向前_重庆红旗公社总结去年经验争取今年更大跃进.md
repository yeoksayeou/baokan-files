Great Achievements in the Great Leap Forward; Encouraging Progress and Moving Forward Again
Hongqi Commune in Chongqing Sums Up Last Year's Experiences to Strive for an Even Greater Leap Forward This Year

(Our reporter Zheng Qimin reports) The Party Committee of the Hongqi People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing City, Sichuan Province, throughout the socialist and communist education movement, consistently implemented the spirit of "boosting morale, establishing confidence, and encouraging enthusiasm" among cadres and the masses, so that the masses have always maintained a strong fighting spirit, thereby promoting a great leap forward in winter production.

During the rectification of the commune, the masses posted more than 4,200 big-character posters and voiced more than 7,000 opinions. Most of these opinions were correct, but they also reflected various different understandings of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Therefore, in addition to accepting the correct opinions and immediately rectifying them, the commune's Party Committee also convened meetings of production team leaders and branch secretaries to summarize the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 in order to unify understanding. Through the summary, everyone clearly saw that in 1958, the average grain yield per mu was 1,227 jin, a twofold increase compared to 1957. Sideline production such as forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery also achieved unprecedented harvests. Public accumulation increased by 1.2 times, basic construction investment increased threefold, and the average personal income of commune members increased by 15%. These facts proved that the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 were unprecedented. At the same time, everyone also realized that because last year was the first year of the Great Leap Forward, work lacked experience, individual targets were set unrealistically, and some measures were not tightly grasped. With the rich experience of last year, an even greater leap forward can certainly be achieved this year.

After such a realistic analysis, summarizing the achievements and experiences, and finding the existing problems, the thinking of many cadres became clearer, their confidence in their work increased, and their enthusiasm was boosted. Yang Hanqing, the captain of the Fifth Brigade, only wanted to propose measures to increase production in the past, but did not dare to propose production increase targets, fearing being rash and failing to complete the tasks. After the meeting, his ideological concerns were dispelled, and together with the masses, he formulated advanced Great Leap Forward targets and requested to conduct competitions with other brigades. Many commune members also greatly increased their confidence in achieving an even greater leap forward this year.

Next, the Party Committee adopted the method of "setting up models and establishing banners" to carry out the selection of outstanding commune members. After two weeks of deliberation and discussion, the masses selected more than 250 outstanding commune members, including 27 brigade and team cadres. The Party Committee then selected advanced figures with the best work attitude and the greatest influence among the masses from these outstanding commune members, such as Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Jiang Guoyu, old farmer Liu Haishan, and nursery worker Chen Tanxiu, and collected their advanced deeds, using various mass occasions to vigorously promote and praise them. This further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, thus setting off a labor competition of you chasing me, me catching you, comparing attendance, comparing contributions, comparing skillful work, and comparing inventions and creations. Commune member Zhang Jiabao, while carrying manure, sang: "Communist labor attitude is praised by everyone, working regardless of you and me, doing it when you say it, without bargaining, we must get the red flag." In the most recent month, all the commune's wheat fields and more than 3,200 mu of vegetable fields have generally undergone one round of cultivation and fertilization, eliminating third-class seedlings. In addition, 62 new greenhouses have been established, and four small-scale water conservancy projects have been completed.

    跃进成果大　鼓劲再向前
    重庆红旗公社总结去年经验争取今年更大跃进
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：四川省重庆市郊区红旗人民公社党委，在开展社会主义和共产主义的教育运动中，自始至终贯彻了给干部和群众“长志气、立信心、鼓干劲”的精神，使群众一直保持着旺盛的斗志，从而推动了冬季生产大踏步前进。
    红旗人民公社在整社中，群众共贴出大字报四千二百多张，鸣放出各种意见七千多条。这些意见大部分是正确的，但也反映了对于1958年的大跃进，存在着各种不同的认识。因此，公社党委除了接受正确的意见立即整改以外，并召开了各生产队长和支部书记会议，总结1958年大跃进的成绩和经验，以统一认识。通过总结，使大家清楚地看到：1958年每亩平均产粮一千二百二十七斤，比1957年增产了一倍，林、牧、渔等副业生产也获得了空前丰收，公共积累增加了一点二倍，基本建设投资增加三倍，社员的个人收入平均增加了15％。这些事实证明，1958年大跃进的成绩是空前的。同时，大家也认识到：由于去年是大跃进的头一年，工作缺乏经验，个别指标订得不切合实际，没有完成，有些措施也抓得不紧。有了去年的丰富经验，一定可以使今年来个更大的跃进。
    经过这样实事求是的分析，总结了成绩和经验，找到了存在的问题，许多干部的思想亮堂了，工作信心增长了，干劲也鼓了起来。五大队队长杨汉清，过去只愿提增产措施，不敢提增产指标，怕冒了，完不成任务。大会以后，他的思想顾虑解除了，同群众一起制订了先进的跃进指标，并要求同其他大队开展竞赛。许多社员也大大增强了实现今年更大跃进的信心。
    接着，党委又采取“立标兵，树旗帜”的办法，进行了优秀社员评选工作。经过两个星期的酝酿讨论，群众共评选出二百五十多名优秀社员，其中有二十七名社队干部。党委会又从这些优秀社员中，挑选出劳动态度最好、在群众中影响最大的先进人物，如党委副书记姜国玉，老农民刘海山和保育员陈谭秀等，把他们的先进事迹收集起来，利用各种群众场合，大张旗鼓地进行宣传表扬。这样，又进一步鼓舞了广大社员的积极性，从而掀起了你追我，我赶你，互相比出勤，比贡献，比巧干，比发明创造的劳动竞赛。社员张家堡一面担着粪，一面唱着：“共产主义劳动态度人人夸，干活不分你我他，说干就干不讲价，一定要把红旗拿。”在最近一个月的时间内，公社的全部麦田和三千二百多亩菜地，普遍进行了一次中耕施肥，消灭了三类苗。另外，还新建立了六十二个温室，建成了四项小型水利工程。
