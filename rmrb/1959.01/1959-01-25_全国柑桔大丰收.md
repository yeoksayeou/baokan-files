A national citrus bumper harvest
    (Reported by our newspaper) In 1958, citrus producing areas throughout the country presented a scene of bumper harvest, with total citrus production reaching about 8 million dan, an increase of 24% compared to 1957. Many large-scale high-yield orchards emerged in various regions, creating unprecedented high-yield records. In more than ten citrus-producing counties, over 100,000 mu of citrus orchards achieved an average yield of 2,500 to 4,000 jin per mu. Many producing areas that, according to old rules, should have been "small-yield" years, broke with convention and achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. In Huangyan, Zhejiang, 22,100 mu of orange orchards achieved an average yield of 2,850 jin per mu, an increase of 7.73% compared to the "big-yield" year of 1957. In Minhou County, Fujian, more than 8,000 mu of citrus achieved an average yield of 3,159 jin per mu. In Xupu County, Hunan, 5,000 mu of citrus achieved an average yield of 3,612 jin per mu. In Qingjiang, Jiangxi, more than 6,000 mu of citrus achieved an average yield of 4,000 jin per mu, all significantly higher than the "big-yield" year.
    The area under citrus cultivation also developed rapidly. In 1958, it was estimated to reach over 1.4 million mu, an increase of 70% compared to 1957, and a two-fold increase compared to 1952, making it a year of unprecedented development since liberation. (Attached picture)
