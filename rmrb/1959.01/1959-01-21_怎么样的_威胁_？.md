The imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are stepping up a new conspiracy to viciously spread the so-called "threat" of China to the world, especially to Asian countries. The communiqué issued by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Representative Council on January 15, which mentioned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's "concern about the growing threat of Communist China," is part of this despicable conspiracy.

Originally, whether it is the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, one in the East and one in the West, they are both aggressive tools in the hands of the United States. This time, the Western aggressive group openly came forward to take care of the affairs of the East, solemnly issuing its communiqué at the Representative Council of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Representatives of the United States, France, and Britain also made impromptu speeches with supplementary explanations. According to the US representative Johnson, this communiqué was "very beneficial" because it showed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was not only concerned about Europe "but is also focusing its attention on the Far East." There is a reason for this incident; the purpose is nothing more than to deliberately create an extraordinary atmosphere of tension.

Coincidentally, the day before, US President Eisenhower was also in Washington talking about the "threat" of China. According to a report by United Press International, Eisenhower said, "Communist China's movement to mobilize its vast population to make it a military and industrial power is a grim problem for the world." "If they continue to do so, and their goals, principles, and methods remain unchanged, then we must indeed be wary." And this vigilance is "not only for ourselves (referring to the United States) but also for other people neighboring China who are friendly to (the United States)." These words not only echoed the communiqué of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council but also revealed that what Johnson called "very beneficial" was that the United States and other imperialist countries were using the "threat" of China to intimidate "other people neighboring China." What exactly happened? What terrible mistake did the Chinese people make that these bloodstained gentlemen are sending an army of condemnation to verbally attack the new China?

For those imperialists who still念念不忘 (念念不忘 literally "muttering and never forgetting"; idiomatically "always thinking about") turning China into the fat meat on their chopping board, we Chinese have indeed offended them. We did not settle for a fate of being enslaved and slaughtered; on the contrary, we drove the imperialists out of China and are now determined to get rid of economic and cultural backwardness as soon as possible. In the past year alone, the liberated Chinese people have doubled the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and have realized the people's communes in the rural areas throughout the country. This is only to make our people eat better, dress better, and live better, and to make the motherland prosperous and strong, never to be bullied by imperialism again, and nothing more. This is truly the greatest good thing for the Chinese people. This is also the hope of all people who do not want to be slaves for their own country, and it is the sacred right of the people of every country. What is there to criticize?

The Chinese people are indeed determined, and have the strength, to build their country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. The principles and methods used by the Chinese people to achieve this noble goal are fundamentally different from those of all imperialist countries. How did any imperialist, especially the imperialists of the United States and Britain, start their rise? External expansion, wars of aggression, plundering colonies, semi-colonies, and all weak countries are inseparable from the history of the development of all imperialists. Their capital accumulation is built on the blood, sweat, and pain of their own people and the people of other countries. The more the imperialists expand, the more they threaten their neighbors and even people living in distant lands. Isn't the poverty and backwardness of old China and many Asian countries caused by the barbaric aggression and plunder of imperialism! Now, the Chinese people are building their motherland with their own hands and wisdom, relying on their own resources, and giving full play to their diligence and soaring energy. How has this become a "grim" problem and a "terrible threat" to Asian countries? And the imperialists, who have always sucked the marrow of the people of underdeveloped countries, have suddenly become the protectors of the Asian people?

For nearly a century, the Chinese people have suffered deeply from the oppression and plunder of imperialism. We have always had unlimited sympathy for all the countries and peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are still economically underdeveloped due to imperialist oppression and plunder. China is a socialist country, and it pursues a peaceful foreign policy in international affairs. Our country has always adhered to the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence in its relations with its Asian neighbors. China has vast land, abundant resources, and a large and hardworking population. We have no intention and will never threaten anyone. We only ask to be able to build our homeland in a peaceful environment.

The spokesmen of American and British imperialism have recently been so keen on spreading the ghost story of the so-called "growing threat of China," which not only shows their despair about China, their despair about long-term exploitation of the Chinese people, but more importantly, shows their fear of the increasingly strong desire of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for independence and freedom, for getting rid of imperialist and colonialist plunder, and for developing their own national economies. China used to be a backward and poor country. After the people turned themselves over and drove out all imperialists, they have been able to achieve significant construction achievements in just a few years. Why can't people imagine that without the oppression and plunder of imperialism, the people of all countries would be able to live better on their own? China has not threatened anyone. The threat that imperialism feels comes precisely from those people who are currently still under the oppression and plunder of imperialism and colonialism.

The current situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is a serious threat to all imperialists and colonialists who attempt to strangle the national independence movements of various countries and attempt to continue to plunder economically underdeveloped countries. The people there are increasingly aware that without imperialism and colonialism, people can live, and even live better. The so-called "threat" of China is actually a trick used by imperialism to intimidate those with simple minds, attempting to use this to tighten their control over Asian, African, and Latin American countries and strengthen their sabotage of national liberation movements. Isn't the imperialist bloc headed by the United States stepping up its political, military, and economic conspiracies in this artificial atmosphere of tension? They are creating military coups, subverting the governments of some countries that adhere to a neutral policy, instigating some countries to oppose others, creating disputes, and attempting to drag some countries into the aggressive bloc. This is something that people should be vigilant about.

### 怎么样的“威胁”？

    怎么样的“威胁”？
    以美国为首的帝国主义国家，正在加紧进行一个新的阴谋活动，向全世界，特别是向亚洲国家，恶毒地散布所谓中国的“威胁”。1月15日东南亚条约组织代表理事会上，发表了北大西洋公约组织理事会的一个公报，这个公报谈到了北大西洋公约组织对所谓“共产党中国日益增长的威胁表示关切”，就是这个卑鄙阴谋的一部分。
    本来，不管它东南亚条约组织也好，北大西洋公约组织也好，一东一西，同是美国手里的侵略工具。这一回，西方的侵略集团居然公开出面管起东方的事来，郑重其事地，在东南亚条约组织的代表理事会上发表了它的公报，而美国、法国和英国的代表，还即席发言，作了补充说明。据美国代表约翰逊说，这个公报是“非常有益的”，因为它表明了北大西洋公约组织不是只关心欧洲，“而且也正在把它的注意集中于远东”。事出有因，其目的，不过是故意制造出一种异乎寻常的紧张气氛。
    无独有偶的，就在这前一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔也在华盛顿大讲其中国的“威胁”，据合众国际社报道，艾森豪威尔说，“共产党中国动员它的广大人口来使它成为军事和工业强国的运动对世界来说是一个阴森森的问题。”“如果他们继续这样作下去，而其目标、原则和方法都毫无改变的话，那么我们确实必须小心提防着。”而这种提防“不仅是为了我们（指美国）自己，而且是为了（和美国）友好的同中国邻近的其他人民。”这些话，不仅是同北大西洋公约组织理事会的公报遥相呼应，并且道破了约翰逊所谓“非常有益”者，乃是美国和其他帝国主义国家是用中国的“威胁”来恫吓“同中国邻近的其他人民”。究竟发生了什么事情？究竟中国人犯了什么天大的过错，有劳这些手染鲜血的大人先生们大兴问罪之师，对新中国口诛笔伐呢？
    对于那些迄今仍然念念不忘要把中国变成他们俎上的肥肉的帝国主义者来说，我们中国人的确冒犯了。我们并没有安于被奴役被宰割的命运，而且一反其道而行之，把帝国主义赶出了中国，现在又下决心要尽快地摆脱经济上和文化上的落后。就在去年一年中，翻了身的中国人民把钢、煤、粮、棉的产量提高了一倍，在全国农村实现了人民公社化。这不过是为了使我们的人民吃得更好、穿得更好，生活得更好，使祖国繁荣、富强起来，永远不再受帝国主义的欺凌，如此而已。这对于中国人民来说，真是最大的好事。这也是一切不愿作奴隶的人们对于自己的国家的希望，也是每个国家的人民的神圣的权利。这又有什么可以非议的呢？
    中国人民确实有决心，并且有力量，把自己的国家建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。中国人民所用以达到这个崇高的目的的原则和方法，却和一切帝国主义国家根本不同。无论是哪一个帝国主义，尤其是美国和英国的帝国主义，它们是怎样起家的呢？向外扩张，侵略战争，掠夺殖民地、半殖民地和一切弱小的国家，这是同所有帝国主义的发展的历史分不开的。它们的资本积累，是建筑在本国人民和别国人民的血汗和痛苦之上的。而帝国主义越扩张，也就越加威胁到四邻八舍以至居住在遥远的土地上的人民。旧中国以至许多亚洲国家之所以贫弱落后，不就是帝国主义野蛮的侵略和掠夺所造成的吗！现在中国人民靠自己的双手和智慧，靠自己的资源，发挥自己的勤劳和冲天干劲，来建设自己的祖国，怎么倒成了“阴森”的问题，成了对亚洲国家“可怕的威胁”了呢？而一贯吸吮不发达国家人民膏血的帝国主义倒突然变成亚洲人民的保护者来了呢？
    近百年来，中国人民深受帝国主义压迫和掠夺之苦，对于所有由于帝国主义的压迫和掠夺而依然处于经济上不发达的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的国家和人民，一贯寄予无限的同情。中国是社会主义国家，在国际间奉行的是和平外交政策。我国对亚洲邻国一贯坚持的是互相尊重领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的五项原则。中国有广大的土地，丰富的资源，众多而勤劳的人民。我们无意也绝不会威胁任何人，我们只要求能在和平的环境中建设自己的家园。
    美英帝国主义的代言人近来这样热中于散布所谓“中国日益增长的威胁”的鬼话，不仅表明了他们对于中国的绝望，对于长期鱼肉中国人民的绝望，而且更重要的是表明他们对于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民要求独立自由、要求摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义的掠夺、要求发展自己民族的经济的越来越强烈的愿望的恐惧。中国曾经是落后而贫困的国家，这个国家在人民翻了身、赶走了一切帝国主义之后，竟然能够在短短的几年内获得重大的建设成就。人们为什么不可以设想，没有帝国主义的压迫和掠夺，各国人民不是能够自己生活得更好吗？中国并没有威胁任何人。帝国主义所感到的威胁正是来自那些目前仍然处在帝国主义、殖民主义的压迫和掠夺下的人民。
    目前亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的情况，正是对于一切企图扼杀各国民族独立运动、企图继续掠夺经济不发达国家的帝国主义和殖民主义的严重威胁，那里的人民越来越觉悟到，没有帝国主义、殖民主义，人民也可以生活下去，而且还生活得更好。所谓中国的“威胁”云云，实际上就是帝国主义用来恫吓那些头脑简单的人，企图借此来加紧控制亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家加强对民族解放运动的破坏。以美国为首的帝国主义集团，不正是在这种人造的紧张气氛里，加紧进行政治、军事和经济的阴谋活动吗？它们制造军事政变，对一些坚持中立政策的国家的政府进行颠复活动，挑唆一些国家反对另一些国家，制造纠纷，企图把一些国家拉进侵略集团中去。这是值得人们警惕的。
