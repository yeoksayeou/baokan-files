Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Following the adaptation and trial performance of "The West Chamber," Beijing has also been trying out "The Battle of Red Cliffs," adapted from "The Gathering of Heroes," from the 12th to the 15th. This is another bold attempt by the China Peking Opera Theatre and the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe to further innovate excellent traditional repertoire under the guidance of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

In recent years, these two theaters have not only used Peking Opera art to express modern life but also adapted and staged many traditional plays. However, adapting "The Gathering of Heroes," an excellent traditional play that people consider to have been repeatedly refined and quite finalized, is a first.

"The Battle of Red Cliffs" was collectively adapted by Ren Guilin, Li Lun, Ma Shaobo, A Jia, and Weng Ouhong, and performed by famous actors such as Ma Lianliang, Li Shaochun, Tan Fuying, Qiu Shengrong, Yuan Shihai, and Li Hezeng. In this adaptation and performance, the playwrights, directors, and actors worked together to strive for historical accuracy in portraying this famous battle in Chinese history and figures such as Cao Cao, Lu Su, Kong Ming, and Zhou Yu. This time, the playwrights did not focus on depicting Cao Cao's treachery as in the old script; instead, while portraying his political, military, and literary talents, they also highlighted Cao Cao's arrogance, arbitrariness, and strategic mistakes. The Lu Su that the audience saw this time was not a dull person but a politician of Eastern Wu who insisted on the correct line of allying with Liu to resist Cao. In "The Battle of Red Cliffs," the playwrights further portrayed Huang Gai's loyalty, bravery, and patriotism and shaped the image of Zhang Zhao, a representative figure of the surrender faction of Eastern Wu, showing the contradictions and struggles between the pro-war and surrender factions. Several new scenes and lyrics have also been added to the original script reform. In the added scene "Heroic Farewell," on the stage "a bright moon hangs in the sky, and all sounds are silent." On the eve of the great battle, Zhou Yu, in disguise, came to Huang Gai's camp by the river. These two pro-war figures of Eastern Wu, through tragic poetry, poured out their heroic spirit of commanding the wind and clouds and their feelings of parting with tears, like the rolling river. This scene moved the audience with its strong appeal. All the staff of this play also attempted to make several reforms in performance, singing, music, makeup, costumes, and sets. The lines of Cao Cao's facial makeup have not changed, but the color has been changed to white with red. On the stage, magnificent backgrounds such as the flames of fire rarely seen in "The Gathering of Heroes" reflected on the blue sky of the Yangtze River and a magnificent scene that summarized Cao Cao's army of 830,000 appeared.

The trial performance of "The Battle of Red Cliffs" has aroused widespread attention from the Beijing drama circle and Peking Opera enthusiasts. The Chinese Dramatists Association will organize a symposium to specifically discuss the experience and problems of adapting "The Battle of Red Cliffs" and "The West Chamber." The adapters and actors of "The Battle of Red Cliffs" are prepared to further revise and refine it based on opinions from all sides. Xiao Changhua, who began to lead the rehearsal of "The Gathering of Heroes" more than 50 years ago, commented on this adaptation: The changes and additions all seem reasonable. In this way, the play becomes more and more lively. Mei Lanfang, president of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, believes that the adaptation and performance of this play are very successful. He pointed out that this adaptation once again proves that re-creation on the basis of traditional repertoire can achieve the achievement of weeding through the old to bring forth the new.

The general audience is very interested in this trial performance. Many people think that the changes are "very appropriate." Some viewers also believe that the play is not performed fully enough, and they suggest that in addition to the existing script, a longer version should be compiled. (Attached picture)

### 推陈出新鲁肃显机智　锦上添花战火映长江  新编京剧赤壁之战上演

    推陈出新鲁肃显机智　锦上添花战火映长江
    新编京剧赤壁之战上演
    新华社15日讯　继“西厢记”改编试演以后，从12日到15日北京又试演了根据“群英会”改编的
  “赤壁之战”。这是中国京剧院和北京京剧团在
  “百花齐放、推陈出新”方针指导下，进一步革新优秀传统剧目的又一次大胆尝试。
    这两个剧院近年来不仅运用京剧艺术表现现代生活，还改编和上演了不少传统剧目。但是，像改编“群英会”这种被人们认为已经千锤百炼、相当定型了的优秀传统剧目，还是第一次。
      “赤壁之战”是由任桂林、李纶、马少波、阿甲、翁偶虹集体改编的，参加演出的有马连良、李少春、谭富英、裘盛戎、袁世海、李和曾等著名的演员。在这次改编和演出过程中，剧作者、导演、演员通力合作，企图在表现我国历史上这一著名战役以及曹操、鲁肃、孔明、周瑜等人物的时候，力求符合于历史的真实。剧作者这次没有像旧剧本那样着重刻划曹操的奸诈；而是在表现了他的政治、军事和文学方面才能的同时，也突出了曹操的骄横武断和战略错误。观众们这次看到的鲁肃也不是一个呆气十足的人，而是东吴坚持联刘抗曹正确路线的政治家。在“赤壁之战”中，剧作者还进一步刻划了黄盖的忠勇爱国的精神，塑造了东吴主降派代表人物张昭的形象，表现了主战派和投降派之间的矛盾和斗争。在原剧本改革中，还增加了若干新场目和新唱词。在增添的“壮别”一场中，舞台上“明月横空，万籁俱寂”，在大战的前夕，周瑜微服来到江边黄盖的营前。这两位东吴的主战派，通过悲壮的诗歌，把他们叱咤风云的英雄气概和挥泪惜别的心情，好似滚滚江水般地倾吐出来。这场戏以强烈的感染力激动了观众。这个剧的全体工作人员对表演、唱腔、音乐、扮像、服装、布景等方面，也都尝试进行了若干改革。曹操的脸谱的线条未变，但颜色改成白中露红。在舞台上出现了过去在“群英会”中所少见的火光映红长江碧空等宏伟背景，以及概括表现曹操八十三万大军的威武场面。
    “赤壁之战”的试演，已经引起北京戏剧界和京剧爱好者的广泛注意。中国戏剧家协会将组织座谈会，专门讨论改编“赤壁之战”和“西厢记”的经验和问题。“赤壁之战”的改编者和演员准备根据各方面意见，进一步修改、加工。在五十多年前就开始领导排演“群英会”的萧长华评论这次改编说：改改添添，看起来都合情合理。这样，戏就越演越活了。中国戏曲研究院院长梅兰芳认为，这个戏的改编和演出都很成功。他指出，这次改编又一次证明，在传统剧目的基础上进行再创造，可以取得推陈出新的成就。
    一般观众对这次试演感到很大兴趣。很多人认为改的“很得体”。也有一些观众认为，戏还演的不够充分，他们建议在现有的剧本之外，再编一个长些的本子。（附图片）
