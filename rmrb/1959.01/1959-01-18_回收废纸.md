    Recycling Waste Paper

    Fully guaranteeing the supply of raw materials is one of the prerequisites for achieving a leap forward in the paper industry's production. Where do the raw materials come from? In addition to strengthening procurement, promoting conservation, expanding the variety of raw materials, and accelerating raw material cultivation, fully developing waste paper recycling throughout the country is also an important way to solve the problem of paper making raw materials.

    Industrially developed countries in the world attach great importance to waste paper recycling. According to statistics, in countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and West Germany, waste paper pulp accounts for an average of more than 25% of the annual paper making raw materials. Among them, the highest is West Germany at 30%; the United States at 33.6%; and the United Kingdom at 40%.

    In 1957, the total amount of waste paper recycled in China was only more than 80,000 tons, which is less than 9% of the total consumption of machine-made paper, only one-third of the average recycling rate of the above countries. Assuming that China's waste paper recycling rate in 1957 was calculated at 20%, it would be equivalent to 110,000 tons less of waste paper being recycled (excluding imported paper and handmade paper). At a price of 200 yuan per ton of waste paper, it would be equivalent to a loss of over 22 million yuan worth of pulp raw materials. Conversely, if these raw materials could be recycled and used, it would increase the production of 110,000 tons of paper. At the minimum price of 1,080 yuan per ton of paper (according to the ex-factory price of glazed paper), it would create 118.8 million yuan of wealth for the country.

    Currently, government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, troops, schools, cultural organizations, and hospitals are the main consumers of paper. In these departments, there are often large amounts of office paper, archives, forms, books, and general internal materials that are constantly cleared out due to wear and tear or the passage of time. For many years, most of the large amounts of waste paper that have been cleared out, with the exception of a very small portion being recycled, have been burned due to reasons such as "secrecy," "trouble," and "worthlessness." This is the main reason for the low waste paper recycling rate.

    Of course, strengthening confidentiality is necessary. The question is how to find ways to preserve large amounts of waste paper for remaking into paper without compromising confidentiality. We have good experience in this regard. When the Party Central Committee was still in Yan'an, the raw materials for paper making in the liberated areas were relatively scarce. However, at that time, effective measures were taken to mobilize the masses to actively carry out waste paper recycling work. All departments were equipped with large water vats, and all the waste paper that was cleared out was torn into pieces and placed in the vat. After soaking in water for several days, it was stirred up and down with wooden sticks to form a semi-paste. Finally, it was taken out and formed into pulp cakes by hand, dried in the sun, and sold to paper mills for remaking into paper. Because the waste paper was shredded and turned into a paste after soaking and stirring, there was no risk of leakage of secrets. It provided a large amount of high-quality raw material resources for the paper industry (except for re-copying high-grade paper, when using waste paper to re-copy general cultural paper, only bleaching and beating is required). This simple and easy method is fully in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. It could be done in the past, and it can be done now.

    China has a vast territory, and comprehensively implementing waste paper recycling is certainly a more complicated matter. However, as long as the broad masses and all departments generally understand the role of waste paper recycling and cooperate closely, the full recycling of large amounts of waste paper is not difficult. If the waste paper recycling rate can reach 20% in 1958, that would be 250,000 tons, which, when used to re-copy new paper, can create a minimum of more than 270 million yuan of wealth for the country. According to China's policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale paper industries and establishing more medium and small-scale paper mills, the recycled waste paper is the best raw material for small-scale paper mills with simple equipment. 250,000 tons of waste paper is enough to supply the needs of more than 1,380 small-scale paper mills with an annual output of 180 tons.

    回收废纸
    充分保证原料供应是实现造纸工业产量跃进的先决条件之一。原料从哪来？除了加强收购，提倡节约，扩大原料品种以及抓紧原料培植工作以外，在全国范围内，充分开展废纸回收工作，也是解决造纸原料的重要途径之一。
    世界工业发达的国家，对废纸回收都很重视。据统计，苏联、美国、加拿大、英国、西德等国家，每年造纸原料中的废纸纸浆平均占25％以上。其中最多的如西德为30％；美国为33.6％；英国为40％。
    我国1957年回收的废纸总数只有八万多吨，尚不到机制纸消费总量的9％，只有上述各国平均回收率的三分之一。假定1957年我国的废纸回收率按20％计算，就等于少回收废纸十一万多吨（进口纸、手工纸不在内），每吨废纸以二百元计价，就等于价值二千二百多万元的纸浆原料被白白损失了。反之，如能把这些原料回收使用，就可增产十一万吨纸，以每吨纸的最低价格（按有光纸出厂价）一千零八十元计算，就可为国家创造一亿一千八百八十万元财富。
    目前，各机关、工矿企业、部队、学校、文化团体和医院等，都是纸张消费的主要对象，在这些部门，经常有大量的办公用纸、档案、表格、账册以及一般内部资料，由于损耗或时过境迁不断地被清理出来。若干年来，大量被清理出来的废纸除极少部分被回收外，绝大部分由于“保密”、“怕麻烦”、“不值钱”等原因而被白白地烧掉了。这是废纸回收率低的主要原因。
    当然，加强保密是必要的。问题在于如何设法在不妨害保密的原则下，把大量废纸保存下来重新造纸。在这方面我们是有很好的经验的。党中央还在延安时，解放区的造纸原料比较困难，但是，当时采取了有效措施，发动广大群众积极进行废纸回收工作。各个部门都备有大水缸，凡是清理出来的废纸一律扯碎放入缸中，加水浸泡数天后，用木棒上下翻搅，使成半糊状，最后捞出用手团成浆饼子，晒干后售给纸厂重新抄纸。由于废纸撕碎后经浸泡搅拌成糊，根本没有失密之虞，为造纸工业提供了大量的上好原料资源（除重抄高级纸外，用废纸重抄一般文化用纸时，只需漂打即可）。这一简便易行的办法完全符合多、快、好、省的原则，过去可以这样做，现在也完全可以这样做。
    我国幅员广大，全面贯彻废纸回收，当然是一桩较复杂的事，但是，只要广大群众和各个部门普遍了解废纸回收的作用，并且紧密协作，大量废纸的充分回收并不困难，如果1958年废纸回收率能达到20％，就是二十五万吨，用来重抄新纸，最低可为国家创造二亿七千多万元财富。根据我国造纸工业大、中、小型相结合，多办中、小型纸厂的方针，回收的废纸正是设备简单的小型纸厂最好的原料，二十五万吨废纸足可供给一千三百八十多座年产一百八十吨的小型纸厂的需要。
