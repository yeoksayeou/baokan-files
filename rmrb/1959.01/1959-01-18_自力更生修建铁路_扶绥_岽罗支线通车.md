    Self-Reliance in Railway Construction
    Fushui-Dongluo Branch Line Opens to Traffic

    (Our report) The first freight and passenger train, fully loaded with coal and passengers, departed from Dongluo Railway Station for Nanning on New Year's Day. This is the first railway built by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region itself—the Fushui-Dongluo railway branch line.

    During last year’s Great Leap Forward in steel production, Guangxi felt the shortage of coal. This year, Guangxi’s industrial construction and industrial production scale are even larger than last year, and fuel supply is an urgent issue. Guangxi has coal mines, but the produced coal cannot be transported out, so it is independently preparing for railway construction. The Dongluo railway branch line leads to the Fushui-Dongluo mining area. This coal mine has abundant reserves and is one of the more promising coking coal bases for exploitation. Currently, shafts are being built here to massively develop the coking coal and industrial and civilian coal of the mining area. After the railway opens to traffic, it is expected to transport 1.2 million to 2.2 million tons of coal annually, which will play a huge role in solving the coal problem for steel and other industrial production throughout the region.

    The Dongluo railway branch line starts from Quli Railway Station on the Laimu section of the Xiang-Gui Railway branch line and reaches the Dongluo Coal Mine, with a total length of 25.4 kilometers, of which 21 kilometers have been officially opened to traffic. In addition to the Liuzhou Railway Bureau being responsible for the design, technology, and track collection and laying work for this railway branch line, the local government is responsible for other aspects such as labor, earthwork, construction tools, sleeper materials, and living supplies. During the construction process, tens of thousands of laborers from Fushui, Tian'e, and Longjin counties demonstrated a high degree of communist cooperation. They issued the bold statement "Build our own railway ourselves, we vow not to rest until the task is completed," and repeatedly broke the quota for earthwork excavation and accelerated the progress of the project. From the official start of construction on November 22, 1958, to December 23, in just one month and one day, they split nearly a hundred large earthen hills, excavated and filled more than 1.5 million cubic meters of earthwork, and erected more than 30 bridges, completing the railway branch line as scheduled.

### 自力更生修建铁路  扶绥——岽罗支线通车

    自力更生修建铁路
    扶绥——岽罗支线通车
    本报讯　元旦，满装煤炭和旅客的第一列客货混合列车，由岽罗火车站驶往南宁。这是广西僮族自治区自办的第一条铁路——扶绥岽罗铁路支线。
    在去年大办钢铁运动的时候，广西就感到缺乏煤炭，今年广西的工业建设和工业生产规模比去年更大，燃料供应就是一个迫切的问题。广西有煤矿，但生产的煤运不出来，因此便自力更生筹办铁路。岽罗铁路支线就是通向扶绥岽罗矿区的。这个煤矿储量丰富，又是开采炼焦煤比较有前途的煤炭基地之一。目前这里正在建井，以便大量开发矿区的炼焦煤及工业和民用煤。铁路通车后，预计每年可运出一百二十万至二百二十万吨煤炭，对解决全区各地钢铁及其他工业生产用煤问题，将起巨大的作用。
    岽罗铁路支线从湘桂铁路支线来睦段渠黎火车站起点到达岽罗煤矿，全长二十五点四公里，已正式通车二十一公里。这条铁路支线除由柳州铁路管理局负责设计、技术和铁轨筹集铺设工作外，其他如劳动力、土石方工程，施工用具、枕木材料和生活供应等都由地方负责。在施工建筑过程中，扶绥、天峨、龙津三县的数万民工，发挥了高度的共产主义协作精神，他们发出了“自己铁路自己修，任务不完誓不休”的豪言壮语，一次又一次地突破了开挖土石方工程的定额，加快了工程的进度。从1958年11月22日正式开工，到12月23日，仅只用了一个月零一天，他们就劈开了近百座大土岭，开挖和填筑土石方一百五十多万立方公尺，架设了三十多座桥梁，如期建成了这条铁路支线。
