Shandong is Increasing the Number of Fertilizer Accumulators and Accelerating the Speed of Fertilizer Accumulation; While Strengthening Professional Teams, it is Vigorously Mobilizing Commune Members to Accumulate Fertilizer Individually

(Our newspaper, Jinan, January 18th) Shandong Province is further combining specialized fertilizer accumulation teams as the backbone with individual, dispersed fertilizer accumulation to launch a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement.

In the previous period, leaders at all levels gave due attention to fertilizer accumulation, carried out ideological mobilization, and organized specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, achieving certain results. However, the movement progressed relatively slowly because all aspects of work were advancing in great leaps, and the labor force invested in the fertilizer accumulation movement was not as concentrated or as large; many of the responsibility management systems established by the agricultural cooperatives were no longer suitable after communization, and new rules and methods had not been established in a timely manner.

In response to the above situation, Shandong Province, based on strengthening ideological education, first rationally allocated labor. For tasks that were relatively heavy and concentrated, such as the manufacture of soil fertilizer, the digging of silt, and the composting of pen manure and miscellaneous fertilizer, specialized fertilizer accumulation teams were generally organized to carry them out. For collecting scattered fertilizer and household fertilizer accumulation, commune members were mobilized in various ways to do it in their spare time, so that professional team fertilizer accumulation and individual commune member fertilizer accumulation were organically combined. In addition, fertilizer contributed by commune members to the cooperative in the previous period was priced and returned regularly; fertilizer accumulation leadership organizations were established, and systems were improved. Many areas have now established fertilizer accumulation offices or fertilizer accumulation leading groups headed by secretaries or deputy secretaries to specifically strengthen leadership. Professional team fertilizer accumulation generally implemented a "three-guarantee" (guarantee task, time, and labor) and "five-determination" (determine task, time, labor, quality, and reward) system. Individual commune member fertilizer accumulation also implemented methods of grading and pricing fertilizer, giving commune members certain remuneration; in addition, commune members were allowed to raise a certain number of domestic animals and poultry (pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc.), which not only facilitated fertilizer accumulation but also increased agricultural and sideline products and increased commune members' income.

After adopting the above methods, the fertilizer accumulation movement in Shandong, with vigorously developing pig raising for fertilizer accumulation, vigorously producing soil fertilizer, and widely accumulating farm manure, has been carried out even more vigorously. The province's investment of labor in fertilizer accumulation and the amount of fertilizer accumulated have both increased significantly. Currently, it is advancing at a rate of more than 37.5 billion jin of fertilizer accumulation per day. As of the 15th, the province had accumulated more than 2.3 trillion jin of soil fertilizer, an increase of more than one and a half times compared to a month ago, and also produced more than 50.4 billion jin of soil fertilizer.

### 积肥人数增加　积肥速度加快  山东一面加强专业队一面大力发动社员个人积肥

    积肥人数增加　积肥速度加快
    山东一面加强专业队一面大力发动社员个人积肥
    本报济南18日电　山东省各地正在进一步以积肥专业队为骨干同个人分散积肥相结合，大搞积肥运动。
    前一时期，各级领导对积肥就给予了应有的重视，进行了思想发动，组织了积肥专业队，并且获得一定成绩。但是运动进展比较迟缓，这是由于各方面的工作都在跃进，投入积肥运动的劳力没有那样集中那样多；原来农业社建立的责任管理制度，在公社化以后有许多已不适用了，而新的规章和办法又没有及时建立起来。
    山东各地针对上述情况，在加强思想教育的基础上首先合理安排劳力，对某项积肥任务较重而又集中的，如土化肥的制造，汪泥的挖掘，沤积圈肥、造杂肥等，一般都组织积肥专业队来进行；对于收集散肥，家庭积肥等，则多方发动社员抽空来作，使专业队积肥和社员个人积肥有机结合；此外，对前一时期社员投入社内的肥料进行作价，定期归还；建立积肥领导机构，健全制度。现在许多地区已经建立了以书记或副书记为首的积肥办公室或积肥领导小组，专门加强领导。专业队积肥，一般都实行了三包
  （包任务、时间、劳力）五定（定任务、时间、劳力、质量、奖励）制度。社员个人积肥，还实行肥料分等论价，给社员一定报酬的办法；此外允许社员养一定数量的家畜家禽（猪、羊、鸡、鸭等），既便利积肥，又能增加农副产品，增加社员收入。
    采用上述办法后，山东各地以大力发展养猪积肥、大搞土化肥、广积农家肥为内容的积肥运动更加轰轰烈烈地开展起来。全省投入积肥的劳力和积肥的数量都显著增加，目前每天正以积肥三百七十五亿多斤的速度向前挺进。到15日，全省已积土肥二万三千多亿斤，比一个月前增加一倍半以上，还造土化肥五百零四亿多斤。
