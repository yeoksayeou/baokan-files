Learning from Handan, Catching Up with the Advanced

The vigorous manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the Handan Special Zone of Hebei Province demonstrates that the Party committees at all levels in the Handan Special Zone have truly placed the work of manure accumulation and fertilizer production in the important position it should occupy. They are not grasping it in a general way, but grasping it firmly, prominently, and are determined to grasp it to the end, never stopping until complete victory is achieved. This great drive, strong determination, and confidence in striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 is truly inspiring and encouraging.

The first characteristic of the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the Handan Special Zone is the close combination of scientific analysis and revolutionary enthusiasm, with advanced ideology always occupying a leading position. Based on the task of a greater leap forward in agriculture this year, the Handan Prefectural Party Committee specifically analyzed the fertilizer needs of the region, and thus resolved to mobilize the masses to engage in fertilizer production on a large scale, and quickly achieved great results. In our various construction undertakings, a truth has been repeatedly proven: only with advanced thinking can there be advanced indicators; only with advanced indicators can there be advanced measures, which can promote the leap forward of socialist construction. This truth was further proven in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The current manure accumulation movement "is a decisive link in striving for a greater agricultural leap forward in 1959." "We must immediately expand propaganda, call on everyone to take action, and accumulate fertilizer." Without advanced thinking, it is impossible to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses; without advanced indicators, it is impossible to point out the goals of the masses' struggle; without advanced measures, it is impossible to organize the strength of the masses and make them fully投入 to the front line of battle.

Another characteristic of the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement in the Handan Special Zone is that manure accumulation and fertilizer production has truly formed a mass movement. Recently, 1.3 million people in the entire special zone have formed professional teams, and in addition, many people outside the professional teams have been attracted to the torrent of manure accumulation and fertilizer production, combining their own work with manure accumulation and fertilizer production. Manure accumulation and fertilizer production requires a lot of labor. If it is not a mass mobilization, with everyone taking action, it would be impossible to accumulate and produce so much fertilizer in just a few months. Labor is the most active factor in production. The current manure accumulation movement once again raises the question: who can mobilize sufficient labor, who can mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, who can better organize manpower, and who can win great victory. In this regard, the Handan Special Zone's "three calculations," "four determinations," and "five combinations" methods of mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer are also worth promoting.

Another characteristic of the manure accumulation and fertilizer production work in the Handan Special Zone is to hold high the red flag of continuous revolution, wave after wave, battle after battle, constantly advancing to victory. Upon the completion of wheat planting, by January 20 this year, the entire special zone had accumulated 153.7 billion jin of natural fertilizer, an increase of 41.2% over the same period last year, and produced more than 5 billion jin of local chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer. This is already a great achievement. However, the Party committees at all levels in the Handan Special Zone were not satisfied with this achievement, and will launch two more battles before the spring plowing, accumulating several thousand billion jin of natural fertilizer and one hundred billion jin of local chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer. What a great drive! With such a great drive, we will definitely be able to obtain sufficient fertilizer needed for crops, and with such a great drive, we will definitely be able to excellently implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and ultimately be able to seize abundant grain and cotton from nature.

The call to mobilize the whole people to accumulate fertilizer has already sounded, and the Handan Special Zone and many regions across the country have provided remarkable examples of mobilizing the whole people to engage in large-scale fertilizer accumulation. It is hoped that a revolutionary competition of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced will be launched across the country in terms of manure accumulation and fertilizer production!

    学邯郸赶先进
    河北省邯郸专区轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥运动，说明邯郸专区的各级党委真正把积肥造肥工作摆在了它所应当占据的重要地位上了。他们不是一般地抓，而是狠狠地抓，突出地抓，并且决心一抓到底，不获全胜决不罢休。这种对于争取1959年更大更好更全面的跃进的极大干劲和坚强的决心和信心，真是令人振奋鼓舞。
    邯郸专区积肥造肥运动的第一个特点，是科学分析和革命热情紧密结合，先进思想始终占着领导的地位。中共邯郸地委根据今年农业更大跃进的任务，具体地分析了本地区的肥料需要情况，从而下定发动群众大搞肥料的决心，并且很快做出了巨大的成绩。在我国的各项建设事业中，屡次地证明了一个真理：只有先进的思想，才能有先进的指标；只有先进的指标，才能有先进的措施，才能推动社会主义建设事业飞跃前进。这条真理，在1958年的大跃进中进一步得到证明。当前的积肥运动，“是争取1959年农业更大跃进具有决定性的环节。”“必须立即扩大宣传，号召人人动手，大家积肥”。没有先进的思想，就不能调动广大群众的积极性，没有先进的指标，就不能指出群众奋斗的目标，没有先进的措施，就不能把群众的力量组织起来，使之全力投入第一线的战斗。
    邯郸专区积肥造肥运动的另一个特点，是积肥造肥真正形成了全民性的运动。最近全专区有一百三十万人组成了专业队，另外还把专业队以外的很多人吸引到积肥造肥的洪流中，结合本身业务积肥造肥。积肥造肥是需要很多劳动力的工作，如果不是全民动员，人人动手，要在短短的几个月中积成和造成那么多的肥料，是不可能的。劳动力是生产中最活跃的因素。当前的积肥运动，再次提出了这个问题：谁能调剂出足够的劳动力，谁能把广大群众的积极性动员起来，谁能把人力组织得更好，谁就能赢得巨大的胜利。在这方面，邯郸专区所采取的“三算”“四定”“五结合”发动群众积肥造肥的做法，也是值得提倡的。
    邯郸专区积肥造肥工作的再一个特点，是高举不断革命的红旗，一浪接一浪，一个战役跟着一个战役，不断胜利前进。在完成种麦到今年1月20日，全专区积了一千五百三十七亿斤自然肥料，比去年同期增加了41.2％，制成了五十多亿斤土化肥和细菌肥料。这已经是一个很大的成绩了。但是，邯郸专区的各级党委并没有满足于这个成绩，在春耕前还要再发动两次战役，再积几千亿斤自然肥料、一百几十亿斤土化肥和细菌肥料。这是多么大的干劲！有了这样大的干劲，就一定能取得农作物所需要的足够的肥料，有了这样大的劲，也一定能出色地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，最终也一定能向自然界夺取丰富的粮食和棉花。
    全民动员积肥造肥的号角已经响起来了，邯郸专区和全国很多地区已经提供了发动全民大搞积肥造肥的令人注目的榜样。希望全国各地在积肥造肥方面掀起一个学先进、赶先进的革命竞赛！
