Moonlight Sonata
—A Song of Space Rockets
Xu Chi

	I. With great anticipation, I welcomed the year '59. On New Year's Day, I packed my bags. During the day, I visited the Academy of Sciences to offer New Year's greetings and bid farewell, as I was to depart the next day. In the evening, the Great Kremlin Palace hosted a farewell banquet for me. I raised my glass to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, expressing my gratitude and respect again and again. On the second day, as the launch time approached, rocket experts accompanied me to pay homage to the oil portrait of Tsiolkovsky: the first scientist to envision flying in space. And me? How glorious, to witness the first giant rocket. Amid cheers, I set off, leaving red Moscow, flying out of the Soviet border and entering the ionosphere. Full of soaring aspirations, I leaped straight into the sky to seize the bright moon, passing through the archway of the atmosphere, a lone leaf-like boat in the universe.

	II. Now I am on my journey, seeing the tiny Hawaiian Islands. The spring scenery on the island is bright and beautiful, but some people are disturbed and panicked. Seeing the Sumatra oil fields, I have no need for them. Thinking of those who plunder oil, I find them truly ridiculous and pathetic. Unlike America's blind actions, with another unsuccessful test flight, I was still en route on the third day, and reached the Moon Palace on the fourth.

	III. The mysterious universe, the incomparably brilliant space, is filled with interplanetary medium, precious materials of meteoric dust. Cosmic rays are emitted from the boundless universe. All the mysteries of the macroscopic world are displayed before my eyes.

	IV. My fellow countrymen are watching me from their mirrors, please listen to my voice, it is the beautiful Moonlight Sonata. I hurriedly tapped the keyboard of the radio transmitter, playing the beautiful Moonlight Sonata from the magical instrument. The beautiful Moonlight Sonata, the secrets of the universe are told in the song. This music originally belonged only to heaven, but from now on everyone can hear it.

    月光曲
    ——宇宙火箭的歌
    徐迟
    一好容易盼到五九年，元旦那天整行装，白天在科学院拜年并辞
    行，因为明天要起程。夜晚，大克里姆林宫为我置酒壮行色，我举杯向苏联共产党，再三感恩并致敬。初二，快到发射时刻，火箭专家陪同我，到齐奥尔科夫斯基的油画像前去瞻仰：第一个科学家，想到飞翔在宇宙间；我呢？又是多末光荣，第一支巨型火箭。我在欢呼声中起程，离开红色莫斯科，飞出苏维埃国境进入电离层。满怀逸兴壮飞跃，直上青天揽明月，我穿出大气的拱门，宇宙之中，扁舟一叶。
    二现在我在征途中，看见小小夏威夷。岛上春光正明媚，却有人意乱心慌。看见苏门答腊油田，我可并不需要它。想到那种掠夺石油的人，我觉得真是可笑可怜。不像美国的盲目行动，再次试航不成功，初三我还在途中，初四便到广寒宫。
    三神秘的宇宙，无比烂灿的空间，充满行星际介质，流星尘的珍贵材料。从无边无际的宇宙远方发射来了宇宙线。宏观世界的一切谜已展览在我眼前。
    四我家乡的人，正从镜中了望我，请收听我的声音，那是美妙的月光曲。我急忙忙的敲动无线电的键盘，从神奇的仪器中演奏美妙的月光曲。美妙的月光曲，宇宙的秘密曲中诉，此曲本只天上有，今后人人能听闻。
