New Song of the Yellow River
    Wu Yanhen

    The Sanmenxia dam project cut off the main stream of the Yellow River. The water flowed backwards, passing through the new man-made river on the left bank. After the cutoff, the water in the foundation pit on the right bank was pumped dry, exposing the riverbed to the sky, and the power station's plant would be built here. The Yellow River water flows backward, spending its days on the crests of waves. Raftsmen, generation after generation, fight the Yellow River, resenting it, hating it, yet loving it, with its great dangers and waves filling their hearts. The Yellow River flows eastward, filled with sorrow and venting its grief. Back then, Yu the Great split the Three Gates, and the steep cliffs still squeeze the flow. Today, the sons and daughters of the Yellow River have come to sever the main stream of the Yellow River. The long dikes are swiftly built to seize the natural barrier, and the mighty torrents are held in hand. One evil current is divided up and down, and the long dike cuts off the water, causing it to flow backwards. The root of the river's harm has gone forever, and a new chapter in the river's benefit has begun. Raftsmen are again paddling sheepskin rafts, sailing light boats amidst the cheers of victory, and songs and laughter fill the river, crossing the Yellow River at will.

  The bottom of the Yellow River faces the sky, raising two mountain ranges, with the Yellow River in the middle, reversing thousands of years of harmful water, the bottom of the Yellow River facing the sky for ten thousand years. Opening up thousands of layers of rock, the riverbed reveals its chest, and the gems shine with splendor for ten thousand years, the secrets of the Yellow River are before our eyes. Moving in man-made mountains, a power station is built at the bottom of the river, and strings of beads of light shine, changing the face of the Yellow River for ten thousand years.

    黄河新歌
    吴烟痕
    三门峡截流工程，截断了黄河的主流，水倒流，复从左岸的新的人门河流过。截流后，抽干右岸基坑的水，河底朝天，就在这里建设水电站的厂房。黄河水倒流浪涛尖上度岁月，筏工祖辈斗黄河，怨它恨它又爱它，大险大浪填心窝。黄水滔滔向东去，流满悲愤泻尽愁；当年大禹劈三门，峭壁依旧夹堆流。黄河儿女今朝来，腰斩黄河断主流，长堤飞筑夺天险，万里狂涛握在手。一股恶水分上下，长堤断水水倒流，害河祸根从此去，利河历史新开头。筏工又划羊皮筏，祝捷声中荡轻舟，歌声笑语注满河，跨着黄河任意游。
  黄河底朝天举起两架山，黄河夹中间，倒尽万年祸害水，万年黄河底朝天。打开千重岩，河底露胸怀，万年宝石闪光辉，黄河秘密在眼前。移来人造山，河底建电站，万串珠光亮起来，万年黄河容颜改。
