Integrating Chinese and Western Medicine to Create New Medicine
Dalian Medical College Hospital Achieves Significant Results in Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine

(Our dispatch) Dalian Medical College Hospital, in implementing the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has begun to integrate TCM and Western medicine in clinical practice, and research into TCM is gradually being carried out.

In the process of comprehensively studying TCM theory and systematically mastering TCM knowledge, Chinese and Western medicine have collaborated to cure many patients. For example, biliary ascariasis is a common and frequently occurring disease with serious harm. In the past seven years, the hospital has treated 750 cases, nearly half of whom underwent surgery. After learning TCM, TCM doctor Cao Zhonghe and surgeons jointly researched and developed "Biliary Ascariasis Expulsion Decoction" based on "Zhang Zhongjing's Wumei Wan" (Prunus Mume Pill). This achieves multiple therapeutic effects, such as promoting bile flow, relieving pain, stopping vomiting, resolving masses, and expelling worms. Coupled with meticulous care and observation using modern medical knowledge, 79 cases of biliary ascariasis have been treated recently, avoiding surgery, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Another example is acute appendicitis, which was previously treated with surgery. After mastering both TCM and Western medicine treatments, the hospital recently used the TCM compound Da Huang Mu Dan Pi Tang (Rhubarb and Moutan Decoction) and acupuncture to treat 135 patients with acute appendicitis, all of whom were cured. Cholelithiasis is also a stubborn disease, often requiring repeated surgeries. Recently, 18 patients with cholelithiasis in the hospital took "Stone-Expelling Decoction" prescribed by TCM doctors, and under the observation and treatment of Western medicine surgeons, their symptoms improved and even recovered. Nine cases even passed stones. A patient surnamed Wu had undergone two surgeries for cholelithiasis and was admitted to the hospital again due to another episode. After taking "Stone-Expelling Decoction," he successively passed 35 stones from his stool starting the next day, some as large as a finger and others as small as a mung bean. Afterwards, his body temperature stabilized. These are all excellent results achieved through the integration of Chinese and Western medicine.

The hospital also actively carries out research on TCM, adopting the method of learning, organizing, and researching simultaneously, and using modern medical scientific knowledge to study the functions, mechanisms, and efficacy of TCM. The Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, and the Pharmacology Research Group cooperated to explore the treatment of tumors with the TCM "Shen Nong Wan" (Shen Nong Pill). Currently, they are studying the drug's ability to stimulate the central nervous system and inhibit the growth of tumor tissue. The Department of Surgery conducted pathological and biochemical analysis of the stones expelled by the "Stone-Expelling Decoction" in the treatment of cholelithiasis, confirming that most of these stones are mixed-type gallstones. The mechanism of the drug's stone-expelling effect is currently under study. In addition, techniques such as X-ray photography and contrast agent imaging are used to confirm that the TCM "Biliary Ascariasis Expulsion Decoction" and "Stone-Expelling Decoction" do have the effect of expelling biliary ascariasis and stones. While studying TCM, the hospital does not relax its efforts in modern medical science. The Department of Surgery recently performed surgery to cut and re-anastomose the thoracic aorta to treat patients with aortic stenosis, and is actively preparing for aortic transplantation surgery. The Department of Ophthalmology used radiation to solve the complication of excessive tearing after parotid duct transplantation. The Department of Dermatology created a skin-protecting asphalt protective agent, etc.

In the implementation of the TCM policy, Chinese and Western medicine are closely united. Although there are few TCM doctors in the TCM Department, in addition to taking on the heavy task of teaching TCM courses and guiding internships throughout the hospital, they also proposed a guarantee to train apprentices. Western medicine doctors are also full of enthusiasm and seriously study TCM. After the work was carried out, the masses paid more attention to the learning and application of empirical formulas. Then, the hospital's Party organization consciously guided everyone to comprehensively learn TCM theory and systematically master TCM knowledge. In mid-October last year, many staff members of the hospital concentrated on learning and mastering acupuncture therapy. In November, they began theoretical study mainly focusing on "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine." In the work of learning TCM, the hospital's Party organization firmly grasped ideological work. The hospital established a special organization responsible for leading the study of TCM, promptly studied and promoted the advanced experience of various brother units, enriched TCM book equipment, expanded the TCM pharmacy, visited talents everywhere, and strengthened the TCM Department. All of these provided a reliable guarantee for in-depth study of TCM. (Yang Chunming) (Attached picture)

    中西医结合  创造新医学
    大连医学院医院学习中医中药收效丰硕
    本报讯　大连医学院医院贯彻党的中医政策，在临床实践中中西医开始结合，中医中药的研究工作逐渐开展起来。
    在全面学习中医理论和系统掌握中医知识的过程中，中西医协作，治好了很多病人。如胆道蛔虫症是一种常见的多发病，危害严重，在过去七年中全院共治疗过七百五十例这样的病人，其中几乎有一半都施行手术治疗。在学习中医以后，中医师曹仲和与外科医师共同研究，在“仲景乌梅丸”的基础上，配出了“胆道驱蛔汤”，达到通利胆道、止痛、定吐、散结、驱虫等多种治疗作用，再加上利用现代医学知识的严密护理和观察，最近共治疗七十九例胆道蛔虫症，免除了手术，疗效达到100％。又如急性阑尾炎，过去的治法是施行手术；掌握中西医两套治病本领以后，最近医院应用中药复方大黄牡丹皮汤和针灸疗法治疗了一百三十五例急性阑尾炎的病人，都治好了。胆道结石症也是一种顽固的疾病，往往要一次再次地施行手术。最近全院有十八例胆道结石病人，服用中医师配制的“排石汤”，并在西医外科医师的观察治疗下，症状都好转以至痊愈，有九例还排出了结石。一位姓吴的病人，因胆结石症曾作过两次手术，这次又发作入院，经服“排石汤”后，第二天起陆续从便中排出结石三十五块，大如指头，小如绿豆，以后体温达到平稳。这都是中西医结合获得的优异效果。
    全院还积极开展中医中药的研究工作，采取边学习、边整理、边研究的方法，运用现代医学科学知识研究中医中药的作用，机理和疗效。内科、外科和药理教研组合作，展开了对中药“神农丸”治疗肿癌的探讨，目前正研究这种药物能够兴奋中枢神经系统而抑制肿癌组织生长的作用。外科对“排石汤”治疗胆道结石症排出的结石进行了病理生化剖验，证实了这种结石大部分是混合型的胆结石，目前正在研究这种药物的排石机理作用；此外还运用爱克司线摄片和显影剂造影等技术，证实了中药“胆道驱蛔汤”和“排石汤”确有排除胆道蛔虫和结石的作用。在学习中医的同时，全院对于现代医学科学也不放松。外科最近施行了胸主动脉切断再吻合的手术，治疗了主动脉狭窄的病人，同时正积极准备行主动脉的移植手术；眼科利用放射线照射解决腮腺管移植术后流泪过多的并发症；皮肤科创造了一种保护皮肤的沥青防护剂等。
    在贯彻中医政策中，中西医亲密团结。中医科的中医师虽少，但他们在负起全院讲授中医课和辅导实习的繁重任务外，还提出了带徒弟的保证。西医也干劲十足，认真学习中医。工作开展后，群众比较集中地注意验方的学习和应用。接着医院党组织有意识地引导大家，全面学习中医理论，系统地掌握中医知识。去年10月中旬，全院许多工作人员集中学习、掌握了针灸疗法。11月又开始了以“中医学概论”为主要内容的理论学习。在学习中医的工作中，这个医院的党组织紧紧地抓思想工作。全院成立了负责领导学习中医的专门组织，及时学习和推广各兄弟单位的先进经验，充实了中医图书设备，扩大了中药房，四处访贤，增强中医科的力量。这些都为深入地学习中医提供了可靠的保证。　（杨春明）（附图片）
