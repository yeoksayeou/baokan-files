Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Havana Dispatch: Cuba continues to hold grand mass rallies enthusiastically supporting the government's decision to punish Batista's murderers and unanimously condemning the United States' blatant interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

On the 18th, a mass rally attended by 50,000 people was held in Pinar del Río, the capital of Pinar del Río Province. Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro once again condemned the U.S. reactionary groups' clamor for intervention in Cuba's internal affairs and reiterated the justice of the Cuban government's execution of Batista's criminals. According to reports, Castro told the 50,000 enthusiastic cheering masses, "We lived in terror for seven full years, and this revolutionary justice [in punishing criminals] is what the Cuban people demand." He questioned, "In the name of what principles can the United States demand mercy for these beasts?" Castro emphasized that only Cuba has the right to try these criminals, "and the United States' obligation is to send the criminals who fled to the United States, along with the wealth they took, back to Cuba." Castro said that the "Cuban mothers whose sons were murdered by Batista have the right to demand the extradition of these criminals." He accused the United States of now being "a paradise for Batista's important accomplices" and stated that "even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, these accomplices must be brought to justice."

The Cuban Provisional Government's actions to punish the criminals of the former dictatorial regime are supported by broad sections of the Cuban people, including members of the clergy. According to reports, Cuban Catholic and Christian organizations have requested that the U.S. Congress cease its hostile activities against the Cuban government's continued execution of criminals. Spokespersons for the Catholic Knights of Columbus, the Saint Society, the Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church have all emphasized that the Cuban new government's actions to punish war criminals are widely supported by the Cuban people. Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro pointed out in a mass rally speech on the 17th that, according to a survey, only 2% of the Cuban people oppose the execution of Batista's murderers, but due to the United States' unreasonable interference in Cuba's internal affairs, it may have changed the views of those few people. It is reported that, in order to meet the demands of the Cuban people, Cuban Provisional Government Foreign Minister Agramonte has formally requested the U.S. government to extradite the criminals hiding in the United States. Agramonte said that a list of murderers has been submitted and requested that the United States place these individuals under custody. (Attached picture)

    美国干涉阴谋激怒古巴人民
    五万群众集会支持政府惩办人民公敌
    卡斯特罗要美国交出前独裁政权罪犯
    新华社19日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴继续举行盛大的群众集会热烈支持政府关于惩办巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的决定，并且一致谴责美国对古巴内政的蛮横干涉。
    18日，在比那尔德里奥省的省会比那尔德里奥举行了五万人参加的群众大会。古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在会上再次谴责美国反动集团干预古巴内政的叫嚣，并且重申古巴政府处决巴蒂斯塔罪犯的正义性。据报道，卡斯特罗对五万热烈向他欢呼的群众说，“我们在恐怖中生活了整整七年，（惩治罪犯的）这种革命的正义是古巴人民所要求的”。他质问道，“美国在什么原则的名义下能够为这些野兽要求仁慈呢？”卡斯特罗强调说，只有古巴有权来审判这些罪犯，“而美国的义务是把逃到美国去的罪犯连同他们带走的财富送回古巴”。卡斯特罗说，儿子们遭到巴蒂斯塔杀害的“古巴的母亲们有权利要求引渡这些罪犯”。他指责美国现在已经成了“巴蒂斯塔的重要帮凶的乐园”，并且表示“即使海枯石烂，这些帮凶也要受到审判。”
    古巴临时政府惩治前独裁政权罪犯的行动得到包括教会人士在内的古巴广泛阶层人民的拥护。据报道，古巴天主教和基督教组织已经要求美国国会停止敌视古巴政府继续处决罪犯的活动。天主教哥伦布斯骑士团、圣士会、卫理公会和长老会的发言人都强调指出，古巴新政府惩治战犯的行动得到古巴人民的广泛支持。古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗17日在一次群众集会讲话中就曾经指出，根据一个调查材料表明，古巴人民中只有2％的人反对处决巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯，但是由于美国对古巴内政的无理干涉，可能已经使那些少数人改变了看法。消息说，为了满足古巴人民的要求，古巴临时政府外交部长阿格拉蒙特已经正式要求美国政府引渡躲藏在美国的罪犯。阿格拉蒙特说，已经提出了一批杀人犯的名单，并且要求美国将这些人加以看守。（附图片）
    卡斯特罗16日晚在一个集会上发表演讲，严正警告美国不要干预古巴的内政。
