    Conquering Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain
    Hu Xuewen

    At the foot of the Miao Mountain Range in Guizhou, there is an ancient forest where 186 Miao families live. This is Jiaowang, a remote mountain village in Jianhe County, Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. According to ancient legends, the Miao families of Jiaowang call this primeval forest "Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain." For thirty-two generations, no one has dared to enter the mountain.

    On Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain stands a large ancient pine tree that the Miao call "Dong Gu Zhe" (Ghost King Tree). Legend says that the mountain forest is the Ghost King's son, the old snake is his princess, and the mosquitoes and ants are his soldiers. Therefore, the mountain forest cannot be cut down, the old snake cannot be killed, captured mosquitoes must be released, and people must give way to ants. Whoever touches a single blade of grass or tree on the mountain will suffer family ruin and extinction.

    For thousands of years, the Miao families have kept a respectful distance from Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain. When encountering illness or pain, they would invariably invite a "Ghost Master" to the Ghost King Tree to perform rituals of exorcism. During festivals, they would slaughter pigs and sheep for grand offerings. Even when eating chicken, geese, or ducks, they would first disembowel the animals and offer the best wine and meat to the Ghost King before daring to touch their chopsticks.

    Until last year, this Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain was conquered by the people of the Great Leap Forward and transformed into a mountain of treasures.

    One spring day, Tai Renqing, the Party Branch Secretary of Jiaowang Township, returned from a meeting in the county and formulated a plan for the township's agricultural Great Leap Forward: 16,000 loads of fertilizer and a yield of 800 jin per mu. That evening, at a meeting of township cadres, they calculated the details and found the fertilizer insufficient. What to do? Tai Renqing revealed his plan: "When I returned from the county today, I took a turn near Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain. The rotten leaves on the mountain are a foot thick. If we collect them for fertilizer, we'll have more than enough, not just 16,000 loads, but 160,000!"

    The six demobilized soldiers present jumped up with joy, rolling up their sleeves, all saying they could do it. However, some snorted in disapproval. The old farmer Long Yuangao was the first to shake his head: "I'll do whatever the Party says on other matters, but Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain is untouchable!" He said he had heard from his elders that thirty years ago, some young people who didn't believe in evil cults ventured into the mountain to collect firewood, but they returned sick and died one after another. Some argued that those were superstitious legends, not to be believed. So, everyone launched into a fierce debate: Are there really ghosts and gods in this world?

    "When I was a child, I also believed in ghosts," Tai Renqing said. "At night, after listening to the adults tell ghost stories, I was too scared to go out to urinate. When walking on dark roads at night, any rustle of wind or grass made me suspect it was a ghost…"

    Ten years ago, when he went out to work as a hired laborer, he specifically bought incense, candles, and paper money to pay respects to the Ghost King, asking for his blessing for a safe journey. Who knew that as soon as he left the village, he was dragged off by the puppet head of the Baojia system to serve as a conscript. After liberation, he stopped believing in ghosts and gods and only believed in the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    "Now that the reactionaries have long been overthrown, Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain is still like a landlord pressing down on our heads," he said. "Party members and Youth League members must first break with superstition and take the lead in going up the mountain to accumulate fertilizer, to work vigorously and mobilize the masses to transform Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain into a mountain of treasures."

    "Let's do it, what's there to be afraid of!" Tai Zhixun, a demobilized soldier, patted his chest and was the first to sign up for the shock brigade. Party members, Youth League members, and young adults all eagerly signed up.

    The next day, after a long period of rain, the sun finally shone on Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain. After breakfast, the shock brigade members, carrying rakes, wooden forks, and manure baskets, marched heroically towards Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain. With a shout, the shock brigade members rushed into the mountain.

    In Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain, ancient trees towered into the sky, and the ground was covered with fallen leaves, emitting a moldy smell.

    "What wonderful fertilizer!" Tai Renqing exclaimed. "These rotten leaves have been untouched for thousands of years. The Great Leap Forward will allow it to completely turn over a new leaf!"

    As soon as he finished speaking, a small patterned snake darted out of the rotten leaves. Someone gasped and dodged to the side. It was the "Princess"! Tai Renqing didn't care and swung his rake to hit it. Zhao Yixin, the militia captain, was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and he hurled a cobblestone, smashing the small patterned snake into two pieces. With the snake killed, they were even bolder. That day, each person collected more than forty loads of leaves. When they returned in the evening, not a single person even sneezed.

    In the evening, the commune members gathered around a bonfire, sitting in the square and discussing the matter. People said one after another: "The shock brigade went into the mountain, killed the snake, and didn't get sick or die. If they can go, we can go too!" A few older people with deeper superstitious beliefs were still worried and afraid; some elders were also ambivalent, hesitating and watching. Just as the debate was unresolved, Tai Renqing stood up and asked everyone to calculate their own accounts to see whether Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain blessed the Miao families with wealth and prosperity, or whether it was the Communist Party that led the people to turn over a new leaf. As they calculated, the elders began to complain about the suffering caused by Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain: When the Ghost Master sprinkles rice, he wants either a chicken or a duck; when the Ghost Master compares the grass, you either lose money or rice…

    "Speaking of Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain, the tears of the poor never dry!" The old poor peasant Tai Jiasuo said indignantly, "That year, there was a tree at the foot of the mountain that blocked my crops. I trimmed a few branches, but the Ghost Master fined me fifty bowls of wine, forcing me to borrow money and rice from landlords and rich peasants, incurring a mountain of debt that took me years to pay off." As people spoke, they became even more agitated, and someone shouted loudly: "Let's storm Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain!"

    The next morning, men and women, old and young, sang songs and marched from all directions towards Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain: …

    During the autumn harvest season, a golden expanse covered the slopes of Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain, and the rice swayed like foxtails. The Miao families of Jiaowang reaped their first bumper harvest since the beginning of time. The rice crop alone increased by 300,000 jin, enough to feed the entire village for a year. They brought the rich fruits of their labor to join the Gedong People's Commune. They also built a two-Li long ring-mountain canal on Ten Thousand Ghost Mountain, releasing the spring water that had been untouched for generations. This not only provided irrigation for the fields, eliminating worries about drought and flood, but also allowed them to build aqueducts to bring the water down the mountain, so that every household could use tap water. Now, they are rushing to build mountain roads to transport the fir trees that their ancestors dared not cut down to nearby lumberyards and forestry chemical plants. In their spare time from logging, the young people have opened up a sports field and a "youfang" (courting) ground on the mountain; this once-forbidden area has now become a public recreational place for the entire village. People sing: We don't believe in ghosts, we don't believe in gods, the Party's leadership is truly brilliant, throwing off the heavy burden, liberating Ghost Mountain and liberating the people.

    征服万鬼山
    胡学文
    在贵州苗岭山脉下，有一个古老的山林，山麓下住着一百八十六户苗家。这是黔东南苗族侗族自治州剑河县的一个边远山村——交汪。古老相传，交汪的苗家都管这个原始森林叫做“万鬼山”，至今已有三十二代，没有人到山里去过。
    万鬼山上有一棵挺大的古松，苗家叫它“冬古者”（鬼王树）。传说山林是鬼王的儿子，老蛇是它的公主，蚊虫蚂蚁是它的兵马。因此，山林不能砍伐，老蛇也不能打死，捉住蚊虫要放它飞去，碰到蚂蚁也要让路。谁动了山上的一草一木，就要家破人亡，绝子灭孙。
    几千年来，苗家对万鬼山都敬而远之。遇到三病两痛，照例要请“鬼师”到鬼王树前去禳解推送。逢年过节，更要杀猪宰羊，大祭特祭。平时吃个鸡牲鹅鸭，也要开肠破肚，先将好酒好肉敬过鬼王，然后才敢动箸。
    直到去年，这万鬼山被大跃进的人们征服了，变成了万宝山。
    春天的一天，交汪乡党支部书记邰任清从县里开会回来，作出全乡农业大跃进的规划，肥料一万六，亩产八百斤。当晚在乡干部会上算细账，肥料不足，怎么办呢？邰任清说出他的办法：“我今天从县里回来的时候，在万鬼山附近转了一转，山上的烂木叶堆起尺多厚，要是掳来做肥料，每亩莫讲一万六，十六万都有多无少！”
    在座的六个复员军人高兴得跳起来，捞手挽袖，都说干得。但是，也有人哼鼻音，不赞成。老农民龙元高首先摆脑壳：“别的事情党怎么说我怎么干，这万鬼山可动不得！”他说他听老辈人说过，三十年前，有些青年不信邪教，闯进山里去打柴，回来东病西倒，死了百打百人。有人反对，认为那是迷信传说，不足为信。于是大家便展开了一场激烈的辩论：天地间到底有没有鬼神？
    “小时候我也信鬼”，邰任清说，“晚上听了大人摆鬼，吓得都不敢出去撒尿。夜间摸黑路，风吹草动都疑心是鬼，……”
    十年前，他出门去帮长工，特意买了香蜡纸烛去敬鬼王，求它保佑一路清吉平安。谁知刚走出寨子，就被伪保长拉去顶了壮丁。解放以后，他就不信鬼神了，只相信共产党和毛主席。
    “现在反动派早打垮了，万鬼山还像个大地主压在我们的头上，”他说，“党团员首先要破除迷信，带头上山积肥，轰轰烈烈的干起来，发动群众把万鬼山变成万宝山。”
    “干就干，怕什么！”复员军人邰治勋拍拍胸膛，第一个报名参加突击队。党团员，青壮年，一个个争先恐后地报了名。
    第二天，久雨初晴，万鬼山上春光明媚。吃过早饭，突击队员们扛着钉耙、木抓、挑起粪篮，雄赳赳，气昂昂地向万鬼山进军。突击队员们一声吆吼，就冲进山里去了。
    万鬼山中，古树参天，落叶满地，发出霉烂的气味。
    “多好的肥料呵！”邰任清叫道，“这些烂木叶，几千年都没有人敢动，大跃进可叫它彻底翻身了！”
    话刚落音，烂木叶里梭出一条小花蛇。有人啊了一声，往旁边躲去。这是“公主”啊！邰任清可不管，抡起钉耙要打，民兵队长赵一心眼尖手快，早飞起一块鹅卵石，将小花蛇砸做两半截。斩了蛇，胆更壮。当天每人掳了四十多挑木叶。晚上回来，喷嚏都没打一个。
    晚上，社员们围着篝火，坐在广场上讨论开了。人们纷纷说：“突击队进了山，打死蛇，没有病也没有死，他们去得，我们也去得！”少数迷信较深的老人还耽心惊怕；也有些父老模棱两可，徘徊观望。正在争执不决的时候，邰任清站出来，请大家各算各的账，看是万鬼山保佑苗家发财发富，还是共产党领导人民翻身。算呀算的，父老们纷纷诉起万鬼山的苦来：鬼师米一撒，不要鸡就要鸭；鬼师草一比，不蚀财就要蚀米。……
    “说起万鬼山，穷人泪不干！”老贫农邰家所愤慨地说，“那年山脚有棵树遮住我的庄稼，我修了几根树桠枝，鬼师罚了我五十碗酒，逼得我向地主富农借钱借米，背了一屁股账，好几年还不清。”人们说着说着，更加激动起来，有人就高声喊：“打进万鬼山去！”
    下一天早晨，男男女女，老老少少，浩浩荡荡地唱着歌，从四面八方向万鬼山大进军了：……
    秋收时节，万山鬼下一片金黄，水稻像狗尾巴样摇摇摆摆；交汪苗家获得了开天辟地以来的第一次大丰收。仅水稻一项就增产三十万斤，足够全村吃一年。他们带着丰硕的劳动果实参加了革东人民公社。他们还在万鬼山上兴修了一条两华里长的环山渠，把世世代代不敢惊动的龙井水开放出来，不但可以灌田浇地，水旱无忧，还可以架枧引水下山，使家家户户都能用到土自来水。现在他们正赶修山间公路，把祖祖辈辈不敢砍伐的杉木运到附近的伐木场和林业化工厂去。青年们利用伐木余暇，在山上开辟了体育场和游方场；这个过去的禁地，如今已经变成了全村的公共娱乐场所了。人们唱着：不信鬼呃不信神，党的领导真英明，千斤重担掀开去，解放鬼山解放人。
