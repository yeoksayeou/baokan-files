Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: On the basis of overfulfilling the 1958 national plan, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will develop its economic and cultural construction on a larger scale and at a faster pace in 1959.

Nguyen Van Tran, Deputy Director of the Vietnam State Planning Commission, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency today that Vietnam's total industrial and agricultural output value is expected to increase by 39.5% this year compared with last year, with agricultural output value increasing by 38.8% and industrial output value increasing by 44.6%.

Nguyen Van Tran said that this year is a crucial year in Vietnam's three-year plan (1958-1960). Therefore, the 1959 national plan is basically a plan for rapid advancement. In order to realize this plan, 61% of the national budget will be invested in economic construction.

According to the plan, grain output in 1959 will reach 6.2 million tons, an increase of 1.7 million tons compared with 1958. The output of various coarse grains will also increase by 73% to 100%.

In animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry, pond fish farming will more than double this year, the number of buffalo will increase by 10%, the supply of pork to the domestic market will increase by 66% compared with last year, and timber harvesting will increase by more than two and a half times.

Nguyen Van Tran said that Vietnam's agricultural production still has great potential. With the imminent arrival of the high tide of rural collectivization and the further emphasis on agriculture by the entire Party and the entire people, this year's agricultural production will achieve even more considerable results.

In industry, there are 79 industrial construction projects above the quota this year. The proportion of the output value of the first and second categories of industry is 28% to 72%. Compared with last year, the output value of the first category will increase by 2%. This year, chemical fertilizers will increase by more than 60%. Many new products will also appear in the production of consumer goods. With the rapid development of the socialist transformation, private industry will be further reduced, and state-owned industry will be further strengthened.

The transportation and commerce industries will also be further developed and expanded this year. The volume of transportation, calculated in kilometers, will increase by 71%. The retail sales of state-owned and cooperative businesses will increase by 13% compared with last year. The value of exported goods this year will increase by more than 85% compared with last year.

Nguyen Van Tran said that the national basic construction investment in 1959 will reach 670 billion Vietnamese dong, equivalent to twice that of last year. Large-scale construction will be carried out throughout North Vietnam, and a large number of new construction sites and industrial areas will appear one after another.

In terms of culture and education, compared with last year, the number of university students will increase by 38%, the number of primary and secondary school students will increase by 25%, and the number of workers and peasants trained to become technical cadres will increase tenfold. Publishing, film, health, and other undertakings will also develop more rapidly than in the past.

Nguyen Van Tran said that in order to complete this year's national plan, it is first necessary to vigorously carry out the socialist transformation of individual and capitalist economies; further give play to the drive of the workers and peasants; and, while strengthening the dictatorship over the enemy, the entire Party and the entire people must engage in a large-scale ideological movement to improve their ideological level.

He said that at present, the production enthusiasm of the workers and peasants is soaring, the Party's leadership over economic construction is being further strengthened, and at the same time, there is the selfless assistance of fraternal countries. All of this will become a favorable factor for the Vietnamese people to overcome all difficulties and strive to overfulfill the national plan.
