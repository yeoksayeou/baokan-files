    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 20th: During the Seven-Year Plan, in addition to the various Union Republics, the economies of the Soviet Union's autonomous republics, national states, and other minority areas will also experience rapid development. The faces of these ethnic regions will change even more rapidly.

    During the Seven-Year Plan, new industrial bases will be established in these ethnic regions. The vast Yakut Autonomous Republic will develop into the Soviet Union's diamond industry center in seven years. The extremely rich diamond deposits here began to be mined last year, and by 1965, they will be able to fully meet the Soviet Union's diamond needs. In the Seven-Year Plan, Yakut's gold mining industry will also be greatly developed. Old gold mines will be further expanded, and new gold mines will be built. In addition, Yakutia will also develop the production of lead, zinc, tin, etc. South Yakutia's coking coal and gas will be developed, making it an important fuel industrial base in the northeastern Soviet Union.

    The rich natural resources of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic near Lake Baikal will also be developed during the Seven-Year Plan. Geological surveys in recent years have proved that the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic is rich in coal and non-ferrous metal resources. In seven years, the republic will very likely develop into an industrially integrated region. The republic's forest resources exceed those of Finland. During the Seven-Year Plan, the forest industry will be the focus of industrial development here.

    The Bashkir Autonomous Republic, known for its oil industry, will also make a great contribution to the development of the Soviet chemical industry during the Seven-Year Plan. In seven years, Bashkir's production of synthetic materials will increase sixfold, and the production of alcohol and rubber will increase significantly. The amount of alcohol produced, if made from grain, would require several years of the republic's harvest. By 1965, these chemical plants using oil and gas as raw materials will produce more macromolecular synthetic substances alone than the current total output of such products in the entire Soviet Union by nineteen times. By 1965, the amount of nylon materials produced in the Bashkir Autonomous Republic will far exceed the current total output of nylon materials in the Soviet Union.

    During the Seven-Year Plan, the Tatar Autonomous Republic in the Volga River Basin will develop into one of the world's largest oil producing regions. In seven years, industrial investment in the autonomous republic will reach 11 billion rubles, and oil production will be 1.3 times more than in 1958.

    In addition to industrial production, during the Seven-Year Plan, agriculture, culture and education in various minority areas of the Soviet Union will also further prosper, and the people's living standards will be further improved.

    各民族并肩携手迈向共产主义
    苏联少数民族地区将飞跃发展
    七年计划期间将建立新的巨大工业基地
    新华社莫斯科20日电　在七年计划期间，除了各加盟共和国外，苏联各民族自治共和国、民族州等少数民族地区的经济也将获得飞跃的发展。这些民族地区的面貌将更加迅速地改变。
    七年计划期间，在这些民族地区将建立起新的工业基地。土地辽阔的雅库特自治共和国将在七年间发展成苏联的金刚石工业中心。这里的极为丰富的金刚石矿藏已在去年开始开采，到1965年，就可以完全满足苏联对金刚石的需要。在七年计划中，雅库特的采金工业也要大大发展。旧的金矿将要进一步扩充，新的金矿将要建设起来。此外，雅库特还要发展铅、锌、锡等的生产。南雅库特的焦煤和瓦斯将被开发出来，从而使这里成为苏联东北部地区一个重要的燃料工业基地。
    贝加尔湖附近的布利亚特—蒙古自治共和国的丰富天然资源也将在七年计划期间被开发出来。近年来的地质勘探证明，布利亚特—蒙古自治共和国的煤和有色金属资源都很丰富。在七年中，共和国将完全可能发展成为一个工业综合发展的地区。共和国的森林资源超过了芬兰，七年计划中，森林工业将是这里工业发展的重心。
    以石油工业著称的巴什基尔自治共和国在七年计划中，还将对苏联化学工业的发展作出很大贡献。七年中，巴什基尔的合成材料生产将增加六倍，酒精和橡胶的产量将大大增加，酒精生产量之多，如果用粮食来生产的话，将需要共和国几年的收成。这些用石油和瓦斯作原料的化学工厂到1965年仅生产的多分子合成物质一项，将比现在全苏联这类产品的总产量还要多十九倍。到1965年，巴什基尔自治共和国生产的尼龙材料，将大大超过现在苏联的尼龙材料的总产量。
    在七年计划期间，伏尔加河流域的鞑靼自治共和国将发展成为世界上最大的石油产区之一。在七年中，自治共和国的工业投资将达一百一十亿卢布，石油的开采量将比1958年多一点三倍。
    除工业生产外，在七年计划期间，苏联各少数民族地区的农业和文化教育事业也将进一步繁荣起来，人民生活将进一步提高。
