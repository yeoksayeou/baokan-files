A Model for the Mechanization of the Alcohol Industry
    Nantong Builds Mechanized and Continuous Solid Fermentation Alcohol Factory

    (Our report) The Dafeng Oil Factory in Nantong County recently built a mechanized and continuous solid fermentation alcohol factory. This is a new creation in the alcohol industry, freeing China's unique national heritage—solid fermentation—from heavy manual labor. This factory has economical equipment, simple technology, and high efficiency, and it was built quickly, setting an example for solid fermentation alcohol factories to achieve mechanized and continuous production.

    In order to respond to the call of the Ministry of Light Industry for mechanized and continuous solid fermentation, the factory's employees and the staff of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau Food Fermentation Research Laboratory, under the leadership of the Nantong County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, adopted the method of experimenting, designing, and constructing at the same time. They built mechanized and continuous equipment for steaming, cooling, mixing, crude distillation, and refining in nine days and nights. In the construction, they implemented the spirit of "small, indigenous, and mass." The steaming machines, distillation tower belt pulleys, and other components that were originally to be made of steel were all made of earth, wood, brick, and bamboo as raw materials, saving a lot of investment.

    酒精工业机械化的榜样
    南通建成固体发酵机械化连续化酒精工厂
    本报讯　南通县大丰油厂最近建成固体发酵机械化连续化酒精工厂。这是酒精工业上新的创举，使我国特有的民族遗产——固体发酵摆脱了笨重的体力劳动。这个工厂设备经济，技术简单，效率高，建设速度快，为固体发酵的酒精工厂实现机械化、连续化生产做出了榜样。
    为了响应轻工业部提出的固体发酵机械化连续化的号召，这个厂的职工和上海轻工业局食品发酵研究室的工作人员，在中共南通县委的领导下，采取边试验边设计边基建的方法，九昼夜建成了蒸料、冷却、拌和、粗馏、精馏的机械化连续化设备。在建设中，他们贯彻了“小土群”的精神。本来要用钢铁制造的蒸煮机、蒸馏塔皮带盘等机件，全部用土、木、砖、竹作原料，节约了大量投资。
