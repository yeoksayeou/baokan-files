Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: The entire Chinese people stand on the same front with all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for independence and freedom. Yesterday and today, many more cities held mass rallies, strongly condemning the crimes of US imperialism in interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonial authorities' bloody suppression of the Congolese people, and resolutely supporting the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people.

　　Guangzhou held a rally attended by more than 4,000 people on the morning of the 27th. Zhu Guang, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressed on behalf of the city's people the firm support for the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. Duan Guanchen, a returned overseas Chinese who had lived in Cuba for more than 30 years and returned to China two years ago, also spoke at the rally. He said: I personally witnessed in Cuba the collusion between the Batista reactionary regime and US imperialism, which set up so-called "special courts" everywhere and arbitrarily arrested and killed Cuban people at any time on trumped-up charges. US imperialism monopolized Cuba's economic lifeline, cruelly exploiting the Cuban people, causing them to live in extreme poverty for a long time, and forcing them to rise up in struggle time and time again. Now, the Cuban people have overthrown the Batista reactionary regime fostered by US imperialism and achieved victory in the national democratic revolution. US imperialism is unwilling to accept defeat and openly interferes in Cuba's internal affairs. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Cuban people and the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. Representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations also spoke at the rally, unanimously expressing their firm support for the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people.

　　At the same time as this rally, many factories, schools, streets, and suburban people's communes in the city also held gatherings. In recent days, the number of people in Guangzhou participating in activities to support the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people has reached more than 80,000.

Liu Geng, Standing Committee member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee, expressed great anger and resolute protest in his speech against the shameless means of US imperialism and the Belgian colonial authorities in interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and carrying out bloody suppression. Leaders of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal local organizations of various democratic parties and representatives of workers, peasants, and students in Xi'an also spoke, unanimously condemning the crimes of US imperialism and Belgian colonialism and expressing their firm support for the just struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people. The conference finally unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the Cuban and Congolese people's anti-imperialist struggle.

　　Five thousand people from all walks of life in Sichuan Province and Chengdu held a rally on the afternoon of the 26th. Mi Jianshu, member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Chengdu Municipal Committee, said at the meeting that the Chinese people have long suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, and we stand on the same front with all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for independence and freedom.
