To achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural production front this year, fertilizer is a key issue in the current specific situation. Among fertilizers, farm manure and chemical fertilizers (especially indigenous chemical fertilizers) are our country's basic and main sources of fertilizer, which must be vigorously collected. However, it would be wrong to neglect urban fecal fertilizer and sewage as fertilizer sources because of this. From the news in today's newspaper about Liaoning organizing urban waste to "go to the countryside" to fertilize fields, it can be seen that there is indeed great potential in this regard. According to preliminary investigations in Liaoning, the annual output of feces, garbage, sludge, sewage, and factory scraps from ten cities, including Shenyang and Fushun, is more than 404 million tons. If all of these wastes are utilized, they would have the fertilizer effect of approximately 190,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, which can be applied to 1.3 million mu of dry land or 600,000 mu of paddy fields, increasing grain production by more than 700,000 tons. However, the amount that is actually utilized is minimal. According to preliminary statistics from ten cities, including Shenyang and Dalian, only 7.5% of the wastewater is currently utilized, and a large amount of wastewater flows away in ditches for nothing. Garbage is more often used for composting, but it only accounts for two-fifths of the total, and most of it is used to fill gullies or pave roads. It can be seen that there is great potential for developing urban fertilizer sources, and it is very necessary to utilize urban fertilizer sources.

Doing a good job in the utilization and management of urban waste, so that it can "go to the countryside" to fertilize fields, is indeed a broad and complex task. According to Liaoning's experience, to do this work well, the agricultural departments must cooperate closely with the urban construction and health departments to solve a series of problems. On the one hand, efforts must be made to supply the large amount of urban manure that rural areas are eager to obtain; on the other hand, urban environmental sanitation must be ensured. Therefore, the key to doing a good job in the treatment and utilization of urban waste lies in establishing a specialized agency responsible for leading this work on the basis of unified ideological understanding, identifying the sources of fertilizer, formulating plans, arranging transportation and manpower, training technical forces in sanitation, manure accumulation, and sewage testing, promoting advanced experience in treatment and utilization, and launching a large-scale urban waste to the countryside movement in conjunction with the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, so that the large quantity and good quality of urban waste can serve the greater leap forward in agricultural production.

The treatment of urban waste, especially sewage, requires a set of facilities, but it must conform to the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, should be implemented at present. If we start by building large-scale sewage treatment equipment, it will not only be technically complex, but also require a large amount of investment and many raw materials such as steel and cement, which will inevitably prevent urban waste from being immediately used for fertilizing fields and increasing production. In this regard, Fushun City has provided very good experience. They relied on the masses and used old wood to build two 350-meter-long earthen aqueduct projects, which diverted a large amount of sewage to the fields, irrigating thousands of mu of farmland and saving more than 100,000 yuan in construction costs. It can be seen that the spirit of using simple methods to get things done is worthy of great promotion.

    重视城市肥源
    辽新
    要实现今年农业生产战线上更大更好更全面的跃进，在当前的具体情况看来，肥料是个关键问题。就肥料中，农家肥料和化学肥料（特别是土化肥）是我国的基本的主要肥源，这是必需大力收集的。但是如果由此就忽略了城市粪肥和污水这项肥源就不对了。从今天本报登载的辽宁组织城市污物“下乡”肥田的消息中，可以看出这方面确实大有潜力。据辽宁初步调查，仅沈阳、抚顺等十个城市一年产的粪便、垃圾、污泥、污水和工厂下脚等就有四亿零四百多万吨。这些污物如果全部利用起来，大约可顶十九万吨硫铵的肥效，可施旱田一百三十万亩，或水田六十万亩，能增产粮食七十多万吨。但是目前真正被利用的却微乎其微。据沈阳、旅大等十个城市的初步统计，目前被利用的污水只占排水量的7.5％，大量的污水都从沟中白白流走了。垃圾用于堆肥的比较多一些，但也只占总量的五分之二，大部分也都被填了沟壑或垫了马路。可见开发城市的肥源大有可为，利用城市肥源十分必要。
    做好城市污物的利用和管理，使其“下乡”肥田，这也的确是一项牵涉面广和很复杂的工作。根据辽宁的经验，要做好这一工作，必须农业部门同城市建设、卫生部门密切合作，解决一系列的问题。一方面设法供应农村渴望得到的大量城粪；一方面保证城市的环境卫生。因此，要做好城市污物的处理和利用工作，关键在于在统一思想认识的基础上，集合有关部门建立专门机构负责领导这一工作。摸清肥源，制订规划，安排运输力和人力，培训卫生、积肥和污水化验的技术力量，推广处理利用的先进经验，结合除四害讲卫生运动，开展大规模的城市污物下乡运动，让量多质好的城市污物为农业生产更大跃进服务。
    处理城市污物，尤其是污水，需要有一套设施，但必须符合多快好省的精神，在目前应该贯彻土洋结合、以土为主的方针。如果一动手就要建立大型的污水处理设备，不仅技术复杂，还需要大量投资和许多钢材、水泥等原料，这样作势必使城市污物不能立即用于肥田增产。在这方面，抚顺市提供了很好的经验，他们依靠群众，利用旧木料，修筑了两条三百五十公尺的土渡槽工程，把大量的污水引到田里，灌溉农田数千亩，节省了工程费十多万元。可见，使用简易的办法，一样能够办事这种精神值得大大提倡。
