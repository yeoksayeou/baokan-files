Managing the Household Well: Planned Grain Use
　　Yú Sūn
　　
After last year's great leap forward in agricultural production, China achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Precisely because of this, we implemented a "free meals" system in the countryside, solving the problem of food and drink that had plagued Chinese farmers for thousands of years. Today, the countryside is filled with joy and excitement, and everywhere is a prosperous scene of abundant harvests. In this situation, how we use the fruits of labor obtained from a year of hard work is a question that is well worth considering. The fact that many communes are now promoting a method of using grain in a planned way is undoubtedly something that is worth advocating.
　　
In the past, when there was not enough grain, it was considered natural to use grain in a planned way; now that there is more grain, why bother with planned grain use? Admittedly, compared to the past, our grain is much more abundant, and the universal implementation of "free meals" in rural areas across the country is an important sign of the enormous increase in grain production. However, our gaze is always forward-looking. If we want to fully meet the needs of national industrialization and greatly improve the people's consumption level, our grain production still needs to be greatly developed. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in its "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes" required that the national average of grain per person should reach 2,000 to 3,000 jin in a relatively short period. Currently, the average person in China only has 1,200 jin, which is still 800 jin short of the 2,000 jin target, and 1,800 jin short of the 3,000 jin target. Even if we reach the target proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session, when the national average is 2,000 to 3,000 jin of grain per person, we should still cherish grain and use it in a planned way, so that every grain can truly play its role. The reason for doing so is very simple: the ultimate goal of our development of production is to improve the people's lives. Improving lives certainly relies first on the development and improvement of production, but it must also be used in a planned way. Without a plan, even if there are relatively abundant products, it is difficult to improve life better. There is a folk saying in China, "Eating doesn't impoverish, dressing doesn't impoverish, lack of planning leads to lifelong poverty," and that is the reason.
　　
The reason why our socialist economic system has great superiority over the capitalist economic system, in addition to other aspects, is that planned production and planned consumption are very important aspects. Developing in a planned and proportional manner is the law of the socialist economy. The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The production, exchange, consumption, and accumulation of the people's communes must all be planned." This is formulated in accordance with the laws of the socialist economy. Many communes have now paid attention to this issue, such as the Shangyou People's Commune in Huayang County, Sichuan Province, which has annual plans for grain use and monthly plans, and the Hushu People's Commune in Jiangning, Jiangsu Province, which implements long-term plans and short-term arrangements. These methods all embody the spirit of rational use of grain. All the people's communes in the country should consider this matter, and according to the specific conditions of their localities, make planned arrangements for the "seven necessities of life," especially the grain issue. This is of great importance for rationally organizing the production and life of the masses.

    持“家”有方  计划用粮
    于孙
    经过去年的农业生产大跃进，我国的粮食生产获得了空前的大丰收。正是这样，我们在农村中实行了“吃饭不要钱”的制度，解决了我国农民千百年来经常愁吃愁喝的问题。如今的农村充满欢腾鼓舞，到处是五谷丰登的繁荣景象。在这种形势下，我们应该怎样使用奋战一年得来的劳动果实，是一个很值得人们思考的问题。现在许多公社正推行一种有计划地使用粮食的办法，无疑是一件很值得提倡的事。
    在以前，当粮食还不够多的时候，实行有计划地用粮，人们觉得是理所当然；粮食多了，又何必搞什么计划用粮呢？诚然，同过去比起来，我们的粮食是大大丰富了，全国农村中普遍实行“吃饭不要钱”就是粮食生产极大增长的一个重要标志。但是我们的目光永远是向前看的，如果要充分满足国家工业化的需要，极大地提高人民的消费水平，我们的粮食生产仍需要大大的发展。党的八届六中全会
  “关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中要求在较短的时期内做到全国平均每人能有粮两千斤到三千斤，现在我国人民每人还只有一千二百斤，离二千斤的指标还差八百斤，距三千斤更差一千八百斤。就是达到六中全会提出的指标，全国人民平均一人有二千斤到三千斤粮食的时候，我们仍然应该爱惜粮食，有计划的使用粮食，使每一颗粮食都能真正发挥作用。要这样作的道理很简单：我们发展生产的最终目的是为了改善人民的生活。改善生活固然首先依靠生产的发展和提高，同时也必须有计划地使用。没有计划，即使有比较丰富的产品，生活也很难得到更好地改善的。我国有一句民谚，叫做“吃不穷，穿不穷，计划不到一世受穷”，道理就在这里。
    我们的社会主义经济制度，所以比资本主义经济制度具有极大的优越性，除了其他的方面以外，计划生产和计划消费是一个很重要的方面。有计划地按比例发展，是社会主义经济的法则，党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“人民公社的生产、交换、消费和积累，都必须有计划”。就是根据社会主义经济的法则制定的。现在很多公社对这个问题已引起注意，如四川华阳县上游人民公社用粮年有年计划，月有月计划，江苏江宁湖熟人民公社实行长计划、短安排，这些办法都体现了合理地使用粮食的精神。全国人民公社都应该把这件事考虑一下，根据本地具体情况，把“开门七件事”首先是粮食问题有计划地安排好。这对于合理地组织群众的生产和生活是有极大关系的。
