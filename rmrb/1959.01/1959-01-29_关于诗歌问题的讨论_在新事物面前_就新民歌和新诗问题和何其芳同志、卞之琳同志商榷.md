A Discussion on Poetry Issues
Facing the New
——A Discussion with Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin on New Folk Songs and New Poetry
Zhang Guangnian

I think the articles by Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin on new folk songs and new poetry have promoted the discussion on poetry issues. It’s about time. The problems that have been debated for many years now have the possibility of being clarified. The emergence of new folk songs has forced us to consider these issues. At this moment, Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin published their articles, which opened the prelude to this discussion. It is normal to adopt a free discussion approach to solve academic problems. Through discussion, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, we will all benefit a lot.

It is a well-known fact that the ballads of our working people have, generation after generation, promoted changes in poetic style and nurtured the growth of great poets since Qu Yuan. Folk creation is not only an artistic driving force; the essence of folk songs themselves has eternal artistic value. The value of "Guo Feng" and "Yuefu" is also recognized by literary figures of all dynasties. Confucius valued the folk songs of the Zhou Dynasty very much. He personally compiled the "Book of Songs," placing the status of folk songs above "Ya" and "Song." Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty also valued folk songs. He established the Music Bureau, collected poems and recited them at night, including the odes of Zhao, Dai, Qin, and Chu. Of course, they valued folk songs for their own purposes at the time, which are very different from our views today. The huge role and influence that those folk songs later played in literary history was something they never dreamed of at the time. However, this can remind us: Have we fully estimated the significance, value, and role of the new folk songs of our socialist era, which are filled with the spirit of communism? I am afraid not yet. In any case, our vision today should be higher and see further than those of Confucius, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, and others. We should use the historical experience of Chinese folk songs promoting the evolution of poetic styles in past dynasties, seize the great opportunity of the current vigorous development of new folk songs, and enthusiastically throw ourselves into the tide of this great mass poetry movement, pushing its waves and helping its tides, and create a new situation of socialist poetry art's great leap forward and great prosperity. From this perspective, our discussion today on the issue of new folk songs and new poetry is by no means a trivial matter.

I do not think that Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin intentionally belittle new folk songs subjectively. They also saw and talked about many advantages of new folk songs. However, they have in their minds a "modern metrical poetry" or "new meter" that is much better than both new poetry and new folk songs. In contrast, the artistic brilliance of new folk songs is inevitably diminished. When a person has a dream of an ideal beauty in their mind for many years, it is difficult to make an objective and fair evaluation of the real beauty. They do not see the new look of new folk songs in art, innovating the old, turning the old into the new, and becoming new every day. They do not see this as a new change and new development in poetry art. Comrade He Qifang believes that new folk songs are only the use of old forms in art. Comrade Bian Zhilin believes that "the vast majority of new folk songs are not new styles in terms of meter." Obviously, they underestimate the significance of new folk songs in the artistic innovation in the field of poetry.

Since the forms, genres, meter, or styles of folk songs are regarded as fixed and unchanging things (in fact, these things themselves are products of history and have been constantly evolving for a long time. It is simply impossible for them not to undergo new changes today due to the influence of brand-new content), therefore, although Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin have made a higher evaluation of the content of new folk songs, they regard the organic connection between the content and form of new folk songs as similar to the relationship between old bottles and new wine. They approve of learning the thoughts and feelings of new folk songs. They also approve of absorbing certain elements from the forms of folk songs—language, expression methods, etc.—to create their ideal "new meter" and "modern metrical poetry." In this regard, they have expressed some opinions worth listening to. However, if some revolutionary poets among the intellectuals go a step further, regard themselves as ordinary workers, directly participate in the new folk song movement of the working people, use the genres, meter, or styles of new folk songs to write, or write new folk songs together with the masses, in order to more effectively promote the development and improvement of new folk songs and new poetry, they do not quite agree. Because, according to Comrade Bian Zhilin, this is "learning to 'write' folk songs by imitating, because that can only be a forgery and is destined to fail." Such a statement is difficult to agree with. Comrade Bian Zhilin's recently published article has made some corrections to this point. He said: "My requirements for learning new folk songs are also a bit too high." "Making it difficult for intellectual poets who learn to write new folk songs." Therefore, he now says: "It is possible to gradually grasp its essence by starting with learning the superficial aspects of new folk songs." This is a step forward compared to the original statement.

Why are such rules and regulations produced? In my opinion, this is the result of looking at new things with old eyes. Comrade Bian Zhilin said: "As the name suggests, folk songs are always the heartfelt voices that naturally flow out from the people. Folk songs are usually the products of 'anonymous people,' collective products (also finished products that have been collectively processed by the people in the process of dissemination)." This statement certainly has some truth. But if it is inferred from this that individual intellectuals with names cannot learn to write new folk songs, and if they do, it cannot be a "heartfelt voice that naturally flows out," and it "can only be a forgery and is destined to fail," then it is too arbitrary. Comrade Bian Zhilin's "as the name suggests" only considered the name of the old folk songs and thought about the meaning of the old folk songs; he did not consider the name of the new folk songs and think about the meaning of the new folk songs. Indeed, in the old era, some literati of the feudal scholar-official class wrote so-called "imitations of Yuefu" or "imitations of folk songs" out of curiosity, which were sour and only obtained their superficial aspects and failed. However, those great poets who sympathized with the suffering of the people, such as Du Fu and Bai Juyi, consciously learned folk songs, from content to form, from genre to meter, and wrote some very moving "New Yuefu," which not only did not detract from their greatness but also added to their glory. The times are different. Now it is the intellectualization of workers and the workerization of intellectuals. There is no longer an insurmountable gap between new folk songs and the new poetry of intellectuals. Among the new folk songs we usually talk about, a small part may be the works of sent-down cadres, or works processed by intellectuals; in any case, they are copied from walls or recorded from oral accounts, and it is difficult to distinguish them, so there is no need to force a distinction. Take the very famous new folk song that ends with "Order the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way, I am coming" as an example. The last two sentences were supplemented and processed by sent-down cadres (Comrade He Qifang happened to draw the conclusion from these last two sentences: "I think it is actually the free verse of the peasants."). It should be said that the supplement is very good and plays the role of adding the finishing touch. The original author did not come out to object, and the processor did not come out to claim credit; there are similar examples. As for saying that "folk songs are usually the products of 'anonymous people'"; there are now many exceptions. This is because the new society respects new folk songs and at the same time respects their authors. Now, from among the worker-peasant authors, names such as Wang Lao Jiu, Huang Shengxiao, Wang Ying, Liu Yong, Liu Zhang, Ba Jie, Kang Langshuai, etc., have emerged and are well-known to everyone. They are on an equal footing with new poets and echo each other, which is rare in the old society. We also know that famous poets such as Tian Jian and Li Ji not only diligently learn folk songs but also often participate in poetry competitions with peasants and cadres, echoing each other; what's wrong with that? In a recent article, Comrade Bian Zhilin mentioned "mainly based on new folk songs," although this statement is relatively vague, it shows that his views have undergone new developments. We welcome this new development.

Secondly, the kind of simplistic criticism I mentioned earlier is also produced because of the habit of simply looking at problems from the perspective of form. Comrade Bian Zhilin said: "What I said at the time was more or less aimed at the tendency of intellectuals learning new folk songs to mechanically simulate in the narrow sense of the form of five characters per line or seven characters per line, four lines per poem." Of course, intellectuals do not have to stick to the form of five characters per line, seven characters per line, and four lines per poem when learning to write new folk songs, but they do not have to deliberately avoid this form either. Some intellectual poets are attracted by the new style of new folk songs and try to use the folk song style to write. Sometimes they use the form of five characters per line or seven characters per line mentioned by Comrade Bian Zhilin. Seriously speaking, there are not many people willing to make this attempt. These poets who try to use the folk song style sometimes write better and sometimes write worse. Just say that they write worse, the reasons may be multifaceted, and not all of them can be attributed to the use of the folk song style. Comrades who use free verse to write, due to different cultivation and different skills, do some write better and some write worse? However, Comrade Bian Zhilin considers the problem too much from the perspective of form. As soon as he sees someone using the five- or seven-character form to write poetry, he is very disapproving. Why is it that when he sees some worker-peasant authors writing poetry without using the folk song style, he is delighted; but as soon as he sees intellectuals trying to use the folk song style to write, regardless of whether it is written well or not, he concludes that it is a "tendency to mechanically simulate in the narrow sense of form"?

Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin's underestimation of new folk songs in terms of artistic achievement, in my opinion, an important reason is that they have emphasized their advocated "new meter" or "modern metrical poetry" to an inappropriate degree. In Comrade He Qifang's view, the folk song style is an immutable old form and old meter, "far less varied and stylistically rich than the modern metrical poetry I advocate." Comrade Bian Zhilin also has similar views.

Recently, I read the collection of essays "On Writing Poetry and Reading Poetry" written by Comrade He Qifang, including his "On Modern Metrical Poetry" written in 1954 and other articles that talk about this issue. I think the proposition he put forward to establish modern metrical poetry is worthy of our attention. Although it is difficult to agree with some of the arguments in his thesis, I think "On Modern Metrical Poetry" is a valuable thesis from which we can get a lot of inspiration. He made some worthwhile advice to new poetry. He enthusiastically wanted to find a new path for new poetry. Based on his own experience in the study of modern spoken language, he proposed the establishment of modern metrical poetry in addition to free verse and folk song style. He believes that this modern metrical poetry can coexist with free verse and folk song style, but it has greater superiority than free verse and folk song style, and the prospects for development are even greater. We can agree with or disagree with his proposal on modern metrical poetry, but I think we should adopt a positive and welcoming attitude towards Comrade He Qifang's spirit of serious exploration in art. In this article, it is impossible for me to talk in detail about the gains and losses of his modern metrical poetry theory, which opinions I agree with, and which opinions I disagree with. Let's leave these to be discussed later. Here, I just want to raise some preliminary opinions on the part of his proposal that involves new folk songs and folk song style, and correct Comrade He Qifang.

First, establishing modern metrical poetry is a good idea. In the article "On Modern Metrical Poetry," Comrade He Qifang said: "Since the content of poetry is always saturated with strong or profound emotions, this requires its form to facilitate the expression of a lyrical atmosphere of repeated cycles, singing and sighing. Having a certain meter helps to create this atmosphere." I agree with this opinion. Our advocacy of developing new poetry on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry is for the purpose of promoting the glorious tradition of national poetry; promoting the establishment of a new nationalized and mass style of new poetry; at the same time, this also provides the greatest convenience for creating lively and diversified new meters. The new meter of new poetry must be based on the requirements of new life and new content, the requirements of modern spoken language, and the successful experience of new poetry since the "May Fourth" Movement, and it is mostly developed through the use, transformation, and innovation of old forms and old meters. From the large number of new folk songs of the working masses and from the experience of many far-sighted poets using the folk song style to create new poems in the past ten years until recently, we are now very confident in this point. This new form and new meter have begun to appear and seem very promising. It is precisely on this issue that Comrade He Qifang's views are very different from our views. He does not believe that old forms and old meters can be innovated to become new meters and new forms. Although he believes that the folk song style can play a role among the masses, and that the folk song style that has broken through the five- and seven-character restrictions can become one of the important forms of new poetry, he has always believed that: "The folk song style, as well as other folk forms, can exist and can play a role, but it should be said that these all belong to the scope of using old forms, and cannot replace or cancel new metrical poetry." He also said: "The folk song style and other similar folk forms are still very limited in expressing today's complex life. A professional creator can never mainly rely on them to reflect our era. We must establish a modern metrical poetry that is more in line with the laws of modern spoken language and therefore has a much stronger ability to express." Old forms are absolutely old; new forms are absolutely new; they only have opposition, no unity, and cannot see the possibility of their mutual transformation. We do not rule out the attempt to create modern metrical poetry through other reasonable means, but like Comrade He Qifang, opposing the use of old forms and the creation of new forms to each other, and drawing a gap between the two, this not only does not conform to the laws of the development of things, but also does not conform to the practice of artistic innovation in new folk songs. Lively new forms and new meters have already been produced from new folk songs. Many new folk songs do not stick to five or seven characters, but still maintain a fairly neat rhythm or syllable (that is, the "beat count" that Comrade He Qifang said). It stands to reason that they can occupy a seat in the modern metrical poetry advocated by Comrade He Qifang, but they have not received a warm reception. Many excellent new folk songs and new poems in folk song style have also taught us a truth that we did not understand before: some poems are five- or seven-character poems in terms of numbers, but they do not strictly abide by the rules of the old poems in terms of word usage, diction, seeking sound, and rhyme. They use this old form more freely and flexibly; they are not ashamed in the face of new life, but reflect their era with the newest and most beautiful poetic feelings within their power; they do not violate the regularity of modern spoken language, but temper the spoken language of the working people into crystal-clear pearls and jades, and their degree of colloquialization (easy to speak and easy to listen to) even surpasses some poets' free verse; what does this show? These show that the five- and seven-character forms have not died, and they have been living on the lips of the working people; it is not an "outdated shell" that must be "discarded"; on the contrary, under the light of communist ideology, it has regained its youth as one of the various poetic forms of the budding communist literature, truly becoming new forever after thousands of years. Because of this, the five- and seven-character forms of new folk songs should not be discriminated against, and they are also qualified to occupy a certain seat in the rich and diverse modern metrical poetry. However, Comrade He Qifang said: "I think some comrades want to use the five- and seven-character forms to establish modern metrical poetry, which is a sad misunderstanding, and in fact, it has proven to be unworkable"; is the fact really like this? These opinions of Comrade He Qifang were written four or five years ago. At that time, there were indeed good new folk songs, but mass poetry did not develop as greatly as it does today. He saw less of it, and it is common for him to draw conclusions a little hastily. However, by July 1958, the new folk song movement was surging like a tide, and its ideological and artistic brilliance shocked the literary and art circles. Comrade He Qifang still insisted on his old views from a few years ago, forcibly distinguishing the merits of the various genres of new folk songs and his modern metrical poetry, and still asserted that "the genres of folk song style are very limited, far less varied and stylistically rich than the modern metrical poetry I advocate." Isn't this prejudice too deep, so that he praises and criticizes arbitrarily, and exaggerates too much?

Second, Comrade He Qifang said: "I have always advocated diversified national forms. In 'Talking about New Poetry,' I once said: The form of new poetry can only set such a widest, but also the most correct standard: All forms that can more fully express the content we want to express and are relatively easily accepted by the vast readers are good forms, from Allegro to free verse, from old forms to new forms." I understand that the vast readers mentioned here mainly refer to workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres; these good forms are also mass-oriented and diversified national forms. So this passage is very good, and its particularly commendable point is that it emphasizes that good poetry forms should be relatively easily accepted by the vast masses. Comrade He Qifang told us that after many considerations, he solemnly proposed the establishment of modern metrical poetry. We have said that this proposition is worthy of attention and deserves special discussion. But there is one point that needs to be discussed here, that is, when Comrade He Qifang proposed the establishment of modern metrical poetry, the kind of mass viewpoint and the spirit of proceeding from reality at the beginning were not so clear. In the article "On Modern Metrical Poetry," he said: "When this kind of metrical poetry is not very mature, that is, when it has not produced a large number of successful works and exerted a wide and profound social influence through them, among the masses with low cultural levels, folk song style and other folk forms may be easier to accept than this kind of metrical poetry." This passage is very confusing. According to Comrade He Qifang's own statement, his proposal of modern metrical poetry has not been put into practice so far, nor has it been adopted by other poets. Of course, it cannot be said to be mature or immature, let alone profound social influence. Therefore, it is unrealistic to take it to compete with other metrical poetry—folk song style and folk forms—to the masses. If we want to compete, he also foresees that his modern metrical poetry is relatively not so easily accepted by the masses, so shouldn't the superiority of that ideal metrical poetry be discounted? According to Comrade He Qifang's explanation, this is because the cultural level of the masses is not high, and they can only accept the folk song style temporarily; their cultural level will improve in the future, and we must have foresight. This statement has a certain truth and cannot be completely denied. However, if an art form that is said to be very good in all aspects is mainly not suitable for the needs of today's masses, but mainly suitable for the needs of tomorrow's masses, shouldn't its "modern" nature be discounted again? In this way, we would rather proceed from reality, actively support the buds of communist literature growing out of the modern workers and peasants with low cultural levels, and help them grow into big trees day by day, instead of placing too much hope on future metrical poetry.

Third, we have said that establishing modern metrical poetry is a good idea. The question is, what kind of foundation is this beautiful building prepared to be built on? We advocate developing new poetry on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry, which also includes the possibility of producing new meters through innovation from this solid foundation. This possibility has now begun to transform into reality. But what kind of foundation is Comrade He Qifang's infinitely beautiful blueprint prepared to be built on? It seems that he does not think that modern metrical poetry can be developed on the basis of folk songs, because he overemphasizes the limitations of folk song style and folk forms, and he said that his modern metrical poetry must be built "outside of them." He once talked about "critically absorbing the rational elements of our past metrical poetry and foreign metrical poetry that can be borrowed, including the rational elements of folk songs," which is certainly not the same as basing it on folk songs and classical poetry. He also talked about "according to the characteristics of our modern spoken language" or "in line with the laws of our modern spoken language," but after all, it is still general characteristics and laws, and such requirements can also be put forward for the language of modern prose and drama. It seems that Comrade He Qifang has not found a reliable foundation for his modern metrical poetry blueprint, nor has he found a realistic way to realize his beautiful ideal. Therefore, although he complained that "few people choose this form, which takes much more effort to deliberate than writing free verse and semi-free verse, to make efforts to establish new metrical poetry. Therefore, this most promising poetry form is now written by the fewest people." He advocated: "In the future, our modern metrical poetry will be greatly developed; those authors who have successfully established and enriched modern metrical poetry will be outstanding poets of our era." These words are earnest and full of artistic aspirations, but the speaker is sincere, but the listeners are indifferent! Are our poets really so hopeless? No. As far as I know, some poets (although the number may not be large) tried to develop new meters on the basis of folk songs, and "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" and "Ma Fanto's Mountain Songs" were therefore welcomed by the masses. Some poems by Comrades Ke Zhongping, Tian Jian, Ruan Zhangjing, and He Jingzhi also showed these characteristics. Some of these works can almost be said to be secretly in line with the basic requirements of the modern metrical poetry proposed by Comrade He Qifang ("writing each line according to modern spoken language with a regular number of beats, each beat taking about the same amount of time, and rhyming regularly."), and even more varied; unfortunately, just because they showed a distinct folk song style, or started from the use of folk forms, their efforts (although still very insufficient) have never been recognized by the advocate of modern metrical poetry. As for the artistic innovation courage shown by worker-peasant authors in new folk songs, and the efforts to transform old meters and create new meters, they have not received due attention. Then, who can be blamed for Comrade He Qifang's lack of support and sometimes being misunderstood? It must be stated: We do not oppose Comrade He Qifang or other comrades trying to establish modern metrical poetry through other means; but if things that should not be diametrically opposed are opposed, thereby actually belittling the creative efforts to develop new poetry on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry, including the creation of new forms and new meters through innovation from old forms, that is not agreeable. Our disagreement with Comrade He Qifang lies here.

As far as I understand, we and Comrade He Qifang are consistent on the overall goal of creating diversified national forms of poetry and creating new meters of national forms. As for the method, such as on what basis to develop new meters, this is very inconsistent. If Comrade He Qifang had a more full estimate of the artistic achievements of new folk songs, and a more appropriate understanding of the relationship between content and form, and if he proceeded more from reality and saw the broad prospects of developing modern metrical poetry from the new folk song movement, then he would be very happy because his beautiful ideals are sprouting and growing everywhere in the real land. He will find many like-minded collaborators from among the new folk song authors and from among the poets. His proposal of modern metrical poetry (after revision and supplement) will be agreed by more people, and his modern metrical poetry activities will not be lonely and deserted, but lively.

As for the new meter in Comrade Bian Zhilin's mind, and the modern metrical poetry in Comrade He Qifang's mind, there are similarities and also differences. In the article "Where is the Difference?", Comrade Bian Zhilin talked about his past views on new meter. He said: "In the past, I considered the issue of new poetry meter based on the practice of poetry creation since the 'May Fourth' Movement, based on the characteristics of modern spoken language, referring to the laws of classical poetry and Western poetry, and under the guidance of the basic principles of rhythm in Chinese and foreign poetry. I also did not 'abandon' the folk song style." Comrade Bian Zhilin has been known for writing metrical poetry for many years. Can we understand his proposition based on his practice? I think it is possible. I accidentally flipped through Professor Wang Li's book "Chinese Poetry Rhythmics" and found that Chapter 5, which talks about Europeanized poetry, quoted Comrade Bian Zhilin's poetry examples more than 30 times, including some poems from the famous "Collection of Comfort Letters." We know that Comrade Bian Zhilin is very knowledgeable about British poetry. The forms and meters of his poems have accepted more influences from British poetry, and some are simply imitations of British poetry meters. For example, using the sonnet form to sing about the fighting life of Yan'an in those years, no matter how harmonious the language and rhyme are, it always feels awkward to read. Perhaps from another perspective, the author's thoughts and feelings at the time were more coordinated with the sonnet form he was accustomed to at the time, and very uncoordinated with the folk song style. Don't think that Professor Wang Li's book is just a book of materials, and the author sometimes expresses his own views. For example, at the end of this chapter, the author said with emotion: "In the past two decades, some Chinese poets have indeed tended to value meter, and the most convenient way is to imitate Western meter. Pure imitation is not a good solution either; we should absorb the advantages of Western poetry rhythm and combine them with the characteristics of the Chinese language to establish our own new poetry rhythm." I think the trend of imitating Western rhythm that he mentioned includes Comrade Bian Zhilin's past poetry. Then we can also know an approximate idea about the results of Comrade Bian Zhilin's past exploration of "new meter."

But these are the poet's past views. A person's views may continue to develop. Comrade Bian Zhilin reminded us to pay attention to his speech at the poetry discussion meeting of the Writers Association in December 1953 (this speech was published in the "Writer's Communication" published in February 1954). At that time, he expressed "agreement with what Comrade He Qifang said about establishing metrical poetry on the basis of modern spoken language." He said: "Starting from the basis of beat count, our metrical poetry can be varied." This is also close to Comrade He Qifang's view. But it must also be said that some of Comrade Bian Zhilin's poems after liberation happen to have shown serious shortcomings in the use of "modern spoken language." His poems after liberation may subjectively strive to get rid of the shackles of foreign rhythm, but in fact, they still have not broken through the limitations of Europeanized poetry. This is of course not just a problem of artistic form, but from this it can be seen that it is not enough to generally propose "establishing metrical poetry on the basis of modern spoken language," without emphasizing learning the spoken language of the working people, learning the ability of the working people to temper spoken language and beautify spoken language through the form of folk songs, and mastering the habit of rhythm ("beat count"). Of course, we must also see that Comrade Bian Zhilin's use of his familiar forms to praise the great struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and to praise the heroic labor of the people who built the Ming Tombs Reservoir, is in any case worthy of welcome; even his past poems praising the War of Resistance Against Japan and praising Yan'an, their political positivity cannot be denied. We believe that Comrade Bian Zhilin will devote himself to the revolutionary torrent of the masses with greater enthusiasm in the future, and constantly innovate from the perspective of thoughts and feelings, as well as from the perspective of art, and write more and better poems for the people.

New folk songs are new things that have appeared on the horizon not long ago, and it is not easy for people to make a comprehensive evaluation of them for a while. Developing new poetry on the basis of folk songs and classical poetry is an issue that needs to be studied in depth. As for how to establish a fresh and lively, diversified national form of poetry and modern metrical poetry, it also includes many complex problems. All of these need to be further discussed. In the process of discussion, sometimes we may see things from a biased perspective, so let us remind each other! In this article, I may also have inadequately understood and improperly analyzed the opinions previously expressed by Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin, and my opinions may also be biased. I hope to get corrections from the two comrades and more comrades. In this article, I have not focused on inheriting the revolutionary tradition of new poetry since the "May Fourth" Movement, especially absorbing the experience of foreign poetry, not because I want to ignore these important issues. Comrade He Qifang reminded us to "dare to absorb the nourishment of the works of great poets from many countries in the world"; Comrade Bian Zhilin reminded us to pay attention to absorbing "the absorbable strengths of foreign poetry"; they both repeatedly reminded us not to abandon the excellent tradition of our new poetry since the "May Fourth" Movement; these reminders are all absolutely necessary. The construction of new poetry is a large project, and I fully agree with what Comrade He Qifang said, we should have the spirit of "ten thousand kinds of gatherings, combining ancient and modern." It is unreasonable to be complacent with the existing achievements of new folk songs and new poetry. We need development, and we need to improve. This is not a problem either. The fundamental problem is to find a solid foundation that is easy to develop and easy to improve, and it is relatively more reliable to build magnificent pavilions on this foundation. After discussion, if we reach a common understanding on this point, that will be an extraordinary gain.

[Appendix] The words of Comrade He Qifang quoted in the article are from the article "On the 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' Issue of New Poetry" (see "Virgin Land" July 1958 issue) and the book "On Writing Poetry and Reading Poetry" (published by the Writers Publishing House). The words of Comrade Bian Zhilin quoted in the article are from the following three articles: "Several Views on the Development of New Poetry" (see "Virgin Land" July 1958 issue); "Where is the Difference?" (see "Poetry Journal" November 1958 issue); "On the Development of Poetry" (see page 7 of this newspaper on January 13, 1959).

    关于诗歌问题的讨论
    在新事物面前
    ——就新民歌和新诗问题和何其芳同志、卞之琳同志商榷
    张光年
    我觉得何其芳、卞之琳同志关于新民歌和新诗的文章对这次诗歌问题的讨论起了促进作用。是时候了，多年来争论不休的问题，现在有可能争出一个眉目来。新民歌的涌现，逼得我们非考虑这些问题不可。正在这个时候，何其芳、卞之琳同志发表了文章，揭开了这个讨论的序幕。学术上的问题，采取自由讨论的方式来解决，这是正常的现象。经过讨论，互相取长补短，我们大家都会得益不浅。
    我国劳动人民的歌谣，一代一代地推动了诗风的变化，哺育了屈原以来历代大诗人的成长，这已经是众所周知的事实了。民间创作不仅是艺术上的一种推动力量；民歌中的精华，本身就具有永恒的艺术价值。“国风”和“乐府”的价值，这也是历代文学家们所公认的。孔夫子就很看重周代民歌，他亲手编订“诗经”，把民歌的地位列在“雅”“颂”之上。汉武帝也看重民歌，他设立乐府，采诗夜诵，有赵、代、秦、楚之讴。自然，他们之所以重视民歌，有他们当时的用意，和我们今天的见解很不相同。那些民歌在后来的文学史上发生了巨大的作用和影响，更是他们当时梦想不到的。不过由此可以提醒我们：我们对于我国社会主义时代的洋溢着共产主义精神的新民歌，它们的意义、价值和作用，是不是已经估计得很充分了？恐怕还不能这样说。无论如何，我们今天的眼光，总应当比孔夫子、汉武帝等人的眼光更高一些，看得更远一些才对。我们应当利用我国民歌推动历代诗风演变的历史经验，抓住当前新民歌蓬勃发展的大好时机，满怀热情地投入这个伟大的群众性的诗歌运动的浪潮中间，推其波而助其澜，一直推出一个社会主义诗歌艺术大跃进、大繁荣的新局面。从这个意义看来，我们今天围绕在新民歌和新诗问题上的讨论，就决不是一件小事情。
    我并不认为何其芳同志、卞之琳同志主观上有意轻视新民歌。他们也看到了、谈到了新民歌的许多优点。可是，他们头脑里预先有一个比新诗和新民歌都要好得多的“现代格律诗”或“新格律”，相形之下，新民歌的艺术上的光彩不免因此而减色。一个人头脑里有了多年来梦寐以求的理想的美人，对现实中的美人就很难做出客观的、公正的评价了。他们看不到新民歌在艺术上推陈出新、化旧为新、日新又新的新面貌，看不到这是诗歌艺术上的一个新变化，新发展。何其芳同志认为新民歌在艺术上不过是旧形式的利用。卞之琳同志认为“新民歌极大多数在格律上并不是甚么新样式”。显然，他们对新民歌在诗歌领域中的艺术革新的意义，是估计不足的。
    既然把民歌的形式、体裁、格律或样式看成是固定不变的东西（其实这些东西本身就是历史的产物，长期间不断演变的结果，今天不因崭新内容的影响而发生新的变化，简直是不可能的。），因此尽管何其芳同志、卞之琳同志对新民歌的内容做了较高的估价，但是对新民歌的内容和形式的有机联系，却看成了类似旧瓶新酒的关系。学习新民歌的思想感情，他们是赞成的。吸收民歌形式中的某些因素——语言、表现方式等，用来创造他们理想中的“新格律”和“现代格律诗”，他们也是赞成的。这方面，他们发表了一些值得听取的意见。可是，如果某些知识分子的革命诗人由此更进一步，以普通的劳动者自居，直接参加到劳动人民的新民歌运动中，运用新民歌的体裁、格律或样式来写作，或者同群众一起写作新民歌，以便更有效地推动新民歌和新诗歌的发展与提高，他们却不大赞成了。因为，照卞之琳同志看来，这是“依样画葫芦来学‘写’民歌，因为那只能是伪造，注定要失败。”这样的说法是难以使人同意的。卞之琳同志最近发表的文章，对这一点有所补正。他说：“我对于学习新民歌的要求提得也有点过高。”“使学写新民歌的知识分子诗人感到为难。”因此他现在说：“从学习新民歌皮毛入手也可能逐渐得其神髓。”这比原来的说法多少是前进了一步。
    为甚么产生这样的清规戒律呢？我看，这是用老眼光看待新事物的结果。卞之琳同志说：“顾名思义，民歌总是人民群众当中自然流露出来的心声。民歌照例是‘无名氏’的产品，集体的产品（也是经过人民群众在传播中集体加工的成品）。”这话当然有一定的道理。可是如果由此引申，认为有名氏的知识分子个人就不可以学写新民歌，如果写了，就不可能是“自然流露出来的心声”，就“只能是伪造，注定要失败”，那就过于武断了。卞之琳同志的“顾名思义”，只顾了旧民歌之名，思了旧民歌之义；没有顾新民歌之名，思新民歌之义。诚然，旧时代封建士大夫阶级的文人，有些人因好奇之故，写了所谓“拟乐府”或“拟民歌”，酸溜溜的，仅得其皮毛，失败了。可是那些同情人民疾苦的伟大诗人，例如杜甫和白居易，他们有意识地学习民歌，从内容到形式，从体裁到格律，写了些非常动人的“新乐府”，这不但无损于他们的伟大，而且增加了他们的光辉。时代不同了，现在是知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化，新民歌和知识分子的新诗歌之间再也没有不可逾越的鸿沟。我们通常谈到的新民歌中间，有一小部分很可能是下放干部们的作品，或者是经过知识分子加工的作品；反正是从墙头抄来的，从口头录下的，很难辨别，也就不必强为辨别了。就拿那首非常著名的以“喝令三山五岭开道，我来了”收尾的新民歌来说，这最后两句，就是经过下放干部补充加工而成的（何其芳同志恰好从这最后两句得出结论说：“我看其实就是农民的自由诗。”）。应当说，补充得很好，起了画龙点睛的作用。原作者没有出来反对，加工者也没有出来争功；类似的例子还有。至于说“民歌照例是‘无名氏’的产品”；现在的例外就多了。这是因为新社会尊重新民歌，同时尊重它们的作者的缘故。现在从工农作者中间，出现了王老九、黄声孝、王英、刘勇、刘章、巴杰、康朗甩等等为大家熟知的名字，他们和新诗人平起平坐，互相唱和，这是旧社会所罕见的。我们还知道，田间、李季等著名诗人，不但辛勤地学习民歌，并且经常和农民们、干部们一同赛诗，互相唱和；这有甚么不好呢？卞之琳同志在最近一篇文章里，谈到了“主要以新民歌为基础”，虽然这个提法比较含混，却说明他的看法有了新发展。我们欢迎这个新发展。
    其次，所以产生刚才说的那种简单化的批评，还因为习惯于单纯从形式上看问题的缘故。卞之琳同志说：“我当时说那样的话多少是针对了知识分子学习新民歌，只在五言一句或七言一句，四句一首这样狭义的形式上机械模拟的倾向。”知识分子学写新民歌，当然不必拘泥于五言一句、七言一句、四句一首的形式，但是也不必特为回避这种形式。有些知识分子诗人为新民歌的新风格所吸引，尝试着采用民歌体来写作，有时采用了卞之琳同志所说的五言一句或七言一句的形式，认真说来，肯于做这种尝试的人，并不是很多的。这些试用民歌体的诗人，有时候写得好一些，有时候写得差一些。就说写得差一些吧，原因可能是多方面的，不一定都归咎于采用民歌体。采用自由诗写作的同志们，由于修养不同，功力不同，不是也有写得好一些的，也有写得差一些的吗？可是卞之琳同志过多地从形式上考虑问题，一看见有人采用了五、七言体写诗，就很不以为然。为甚么看见有的工农作者不用民歌体写诗，便津津乐道；而一看见知识分子试用民歌体写作，不问写得好不好，就断定是“狭义的形式上机械模拟的倾向”呢？
    何其芳同志、卞之琳同志对新民歌在艺术成就上之所以估计不足，我看，一个重要的原因，是把他们所主张的“新格律”或“现代格律诗”强调到不适当的程度了。在何其芳同志看来，民歌体，这就是一成不变的旧形式，旧格律，“远不如我所主张的现代格律诗变化多，样式丰富”。卞之琳同志也有类似的看法。
    最近读了何其芳同志写的“关于写诗和读诗”这本论文集，其中有他在1954年写的“关于现代格律诗”及其他谈到这一问题的文章。我觉得他提出的建立现代格律诗的主张，是值得我们大家重视的。尽管很难同意他的论文中的某些论点，但是我认为“关于现代格律诗”是一篇有价值的论文，我们从中可以得到很多启发。他对新诗提出了一些值得听取的忠告。他满怀热情地要为新诗找出一条新路来。他根据自己对于现代口语研究的心得，提出了在自由体和民歌体以外建立现代格律诗的主张。他认为这种现代格律诗可以和自由体、民歌体并存，但是比自由体和民歌体有更大的优越性，发展的前途也更大。我们可以赞成或不赞成他的关于现代格律诗的主张，可是对于何其芳同志在艺术上严肃探求的精神，我看应当采取肯定的、欢迎的态度。在这篇文章里，我不可能详细谈到他的现代格律诗理论的得失，同意他的哪些意见，不同意他的哪些意见，这些都留以有待吧。这里，我只想就他的这个主张涉及新民歌和民歌体的部分，提出一些初步意见，就正于何其芳同志。
    第一，建立现代格律诗是一个好主意。何其芳同志在“关于现代格律诗”一文中说：“诗的内容既然总是饱和着强烈的或者深厚的感情，这就要求着它的形式便利于表现出一种反复回旋、一唱三叹的抒情气氛。有一定的格律是有助于造成这种气氛的。”这个意见，我是赞成的。我们主张在民歌和古典诗歌的基础上发展新诗，是为着发扬民族诗歌的光辉传统；促使新诗建立民族化、群众化的新风格；同时，这对于创造生动活泼的、多样化的新格律，也提供了最大的便利。新诗的新格律一定要根据新生活、新内容的要求，根据现代口语的要求，根据“五四”以来新诗歌的成功经验，并且多半是经过对于旧形式、旧格律的利用、改造、推陈出新而发展出来的。我们从工农群众新民歌的大量涌现，从十几年来直到最近许多有远见的诗人利用民歌体创作新诗的经验，现在对这一点很有信心。这种新形式、新格律已经开始出现，看来很有前途。正是在这个问题上，何其芳同志的看法和我们的看法很不相同。他不相信旧形式、旧格律可以推陈出新而成为新格律、新形式。他虽然认为民歌体可以在群众中发生作用，认为突破了五、七言限制的民歌体可以成为新诗的重要形式之一，可是他一直认为：“民歌体也好，其他民间形式也好，尽管都可以存在，都可以发生作用，应该说这都是属于利用旧形式的范围，并不能代替和取消新的格律诗。”又说：“民歌体和其他类似的民间形式来表现今天的复杂的生活仍然是限制很大的，一个职业的创作家绝不可能主要依靠它们来反映我们这个时代，我们必须在它们之外建立一种更和现代口语的规律相适应，因而表现能力更强得多的现代格律诗。”旧形式就是绝对地旧；新形式就是绝对地新；它们只有对立，没有统一，看不到它们互相转化的可能性。我们并不排除通过其他合理途径创造现代格律诗的尝试，但是像何其芳同志这样，把旧形式的利用和新形式的创造互相对立起来，在两者中间划出一道鸿沟，这既不符合事物发展的规律，也首先不符合新民歌在艺术革新上的实践。从新民歌中间已经产生了生动活泼的新形式、新格律。许多新民歌并不拘泥于五言或七言，但仍然保持了相当整齐的节奏或音节（也就是何其芳同志所说的“顿数”），它们照理说可以在何其芳同志主张的现代格律诗中占有一个席位的，可是就没有受到热情的接待。许多优秀的新民歌和民歌体的新诗还告诉了我们一个前此不大了解的道理：有些诗歌从数字上看是不折不扣的五言诗或七言诗，可是它们并不严格地遵守旧诗用字、遣辞、寻声、押韵上的规则，它们比较自由、比较灵活地运用了这个旧形式；它们在新生活面前不但不感到羞愧，反而在力所能及的范围内以最新最美的诗情反映了自己的时代；它们不但不违反现代口语的规律性，反而把劳动人民的口语锤炼成晶莹如珠玉的佳句，其口语化（顺口也顺耳）的程度甚至胜过某些诗人的自由诗；这些说明了甚么呢？这些说明了五、七言体并没有死亡，它一直活在劳动人民的口头上；它并不是甚么必须予以“抛弃”的“过时的外壳”；相反，在共产主义思想的光照下，它作为共产主义文学的萌芽的多种诗体之一而恢复了青春，真是历千古而常新。正因为这样，新民歌的五、七言体不应当受到歧视，它们也有资格在丰富多样的现代格律诗中占有一定的席位。可是何其芳同志说：“我认为有些同志想用五七言体来建立现代的格律诗，那是一种可悲的误解，事实上已证明走不通”；事实果然是这样的吗？何其芳同志的这些意见，写于四、五年以前，那时固然也有很好的新民歌，可是群众诗歌不像今天这样的大发展，他看得少，结论下得匆忙一点，这也是常有的事。可是到了1958年7月，新民歌运动势如潮涌，其思想和艺术的光芒惊动了文艺界，而何其芳同志依然坚持几年前的老看法，在新民歌的多种体裁和他的现代格律诗之间强分优劣，仍然断言“民歌体的体裁是很有限的，远不如我所主张的现代格律诗变化多，样式丰富”。这岂不是成见太深，以致褒贬任声，抑扬过实了吗？
    第二，何其芳同志说：“我是一直主张多样化的民族形式的。在‘话说新诗’里面，我曾经这样说：新诗的形式只能定这样一个最宽的，然而也是最正确的标准：凡是比较能圆满地表达我们要抒写的内容，而又比较容易为广大的读者所接受的，都是好的形式，从快板到自由诗，从旧形式到新形式。”这里所说的广大读者，我理解主要指的是工农兵群众及其干部；这些好形式也就是群众化、多样化的民族形式。所以这段话是很好的，它的特别可取处，在于着重指明了：好的诗歌形式应当是比较容易为广大群众所接受的。何其芳同志告诉我们，他后来经过多方面的考虑，又郑重地提出了建立现代格律诗的主张。我们说过，这个主张是值得重视的，值得专门地予以讨论。可是有一点需要在这里谈一谈，那就是，当何其芳同志提出建立现代格律诗的主张的时候，当初的那种群众观点和从实际出发的精神，就不那么鲜明了。他在“关于现代格律诗”一文中说：“在这种格律诗还没有很成熟的时候，也就是还没有产生大量的成功的作品并通过它们发生广泛的深刻的社会影响的时候，在文化水平不高的群众中间，民歌体和其他民间形式完全可能是比这种格律诗更容易被接受的。”这段话很费解。照何其芳同志自己的说法，他的现代格律诗的主张至今还没有付诸实践，也没有被其他诗人所采用，当然还谈不上成熟不成熟，更谈不上深刻的社会影响，因此，拿它来和另一些格律诗——民歌体和民间形式到群众中去比赛，是不现实的。如果要比赛的话，他又预见到他那现代格律诗比较地不那么容易为群众所接受，那么，那种理想的格律诗的优越性岂不是应当打上几个折扣吗？照何其芳同志的解释，这是因为群众文化水平不高的缘故，他们暂时还只能接受民歌体；他们的文化水平以后会提高的，我们必须有远见。这话有一定的道理，不可一概否认。但是，一种据说是各方面都非常美好的艺术形式，主要地不是适合今天的群众的需要，主要地适合于明天的群众的需要，它的“现代”性岂不是又要打上几个折扣吗？这样看来，我们宁愿从实际出发，积极支持从文化水平不高的现代工农群众中生长出来的共产主义文学的萌芽，帮助它们一天天地长成大树，而不把过多的希望寄托在未来的格律诗上。
    第三，我们说过，建立现代格律诗，不失为一个好主意。问题是，这个美好的建筑物，准备建立在甚么样的基础上。我们主张在民歌和古典诗歌的基础上发展新诗，其中也包括着从这个坚实的基础上经过推陈出新而产生新格律的可能性，这个可能性目前已经开始转化为现实性了。可是何其芳同志的无限美好的蓝图，准备建立在甚么基础上呢？看来他不认为在民歌的基础上可以发展现代格律诗，因为他过分强调了民歌体和民间形式的限制性，他说“必须在它们之外”来建立他的现代格律诗。他曾经谈到“批判地吸取我国过去的格律诗和外国可以借鉴的格律诗的合理因素，包括民歌的合理因素在内”，这和以民歌和古典诗歌为基础，当然不是一回事。他也曾谈到“按照我们的现代口语的特点”或“符合我们的现代口语的规律”，但究竟还是一般的特点和规律，对于现代散文和戏剧的语言，也可以提出这样的要求。看来，何其芳同志还没有为他的现代格律诗的蓝图找到可靠的基础，没有找到实现他那美好理想的现实的途径。因此，尽管他埋怨“很少人选择这种比写自由体和半自由体要多花许多推敲工夫的形式，去作建立新的格律诗的努力。因此这种最有发展前途的诗体却反而现在写的人最少。”他鼓吹：“在将来，我们的现代格律诗是会大大地发展起来的；那些成功地建立了并且丰富了现代格律诗的作者将是我们这个时代的杰出的诗人。”这些话都是语重心长，充满了对艺术的热望，可是言者谆谆，而听者藐藐！我们的诗人们果然是这样地没有出息吗？不是的。就我所知，有些诗人（尽管人数不多吧）尝试着在民歌的基础上发展新格律，“王贵与李香香”、“马凡陀的山歌”，因此受到群众的欢迎，柯仲平、田间、阮章竞、贺敬之等同志的某些诗歌，也表现了这样的特点，其中有些作品几乎可以说是和何其芳同志提出的现代格律诗的基本要求（“按照现代的口语写得每行的顿数有规律，每顿所占时间大致相等，而且有规律地押韵。”）相暗合，并且变化更多一些；可惜的是，仅仅因为他们表现了鲜明的民歌色彩，或者从利用民间形式入手，他们的努力（尽管还很不够吧）始终不为现代格律诗的倡导者所认可。至于工农作者们在新民歌中表现的艺术革新的勇气，改造旧格律、创造新格律的努力，也没有受到应有的重视。那么，何其芳同志的孤掌难鸣，有时还不免受到人们的误解，这又能怪谁呢？必须申明：我们并不反对何其芳同志或别的同志通过其他途径建立现代格律诗的尝试；但是如果把不应当截然对立的事物对立起来，因而在实际上贬低了从民歌和古典诗歌基础上发展新诗，包括从旧形式推陈出新发展新形式、新格律的创造性的努力，那是不能同意的。我们和何其芳同志的分歧就在这里。
    照我的了解，在创造诗歌的多样化的民族形式上，在创造民族形式的新格律上，我们和何其芳同志之间，在总的目标上是一致的。至于在方法上，例如在怎样的基础上发展新格律，这是很不一致的。如果何其芳同志对于新民歌的艺术成就有了更充分的估计，对于内容和形式的关系有了更恰当的理解，如果更多地从实际出发，看到从新民歌运动中发展现代格律诗的广阔前途，那么，他将因为自己的美好理想在现实土地上到处发芽、抽条而感到非常欢喜，他将从新民歌作者中间、从诗人中间找到不少志同道合的合作者，他的现代格律诗的主张（经过修正和补充）将得到更多人的赞同，他的现代格律诗的活动将不是冷冷清清，而是热热闹闹。
    至于卞之琳同志心目中的新格律，和何其芳同志心目中的现代格律诗，有相同的地方，也有不完全相同的地方。卞之琳同志在“分歧在哪里”一文中谈到了他过去对于新格律的见解，他说：“我过去考虑新诗格律问题，就是根据了‘五四’以来诗歌创作的实践，根据了现代口语的特点，参考了古典诗歌和西方诗歌的规律，在中外诗歌音律的基本原理的指导下，进行了探索。我也并没有‘抛开’民歌体。”卞之琳同志多年来是以写作格律诗著称的，可不可以根据他的实践来理解他的主张呢？我想是可以的。偶然翻阅王力教授所著“汉语诗律学”一书，发现其中第五章谈到欧化诗的部分，引用卞之琳同志的诗例达三十余处，其中包括著名的“慰劳信集”中的某些诗篇。我们知道，卞之琳同志对英国诗歌是很有研究的。他的诗作的形式和格律，接受了更多的英国诗歌的影响，有些简直是英诗格律的套用。譬如说，用十四行体来歌唱当年延安的战斗生活，尽管语言和音韵是比较和谐的，读起来无论如何总感到别扭。也许从另外一方面看，作者当时的思想感情，和他当时惯用的十四行体比较协调，而和民歌体是很不协调的。不要以为王力教授的这本书只是一本材料书，作者有时也发表了自己的见解。例如在这一章的结尾，作者不无感慨地说：“近二十年来，中国一部分的诗人确有趋重格律的倾向，而最方便的道路就是模仿西洋的格律。纯粹模仿也不是个办法；咱们应该吸收西洋诗律的优点，结合汉语的特点，建立咱们自己的新诗律。”他所说的那种模仿西洋格律的倾向，我看是把卞之琳同志过去的诗作包括在内的。那么卞之琳同志过去对于“新格律”的探索的成果，我们由此也可以知道一个大概了。
    但这是诗人过去的见解。一个人的见解可能不断地有所发展。卞之琳同志提醒我们注意他1953年12月在作家协会诗歌讨论会上的发言（1954年2月出版的“作家通讯”中刊载了这个发言），那时他表示“同意何其芳同志所说的在现代口语基础上建立格律诗”。他说：“从顿的基础出发，我们的格律诗可以变化多端。”这也接近于何其芳同志的见解。可是也不能不说，卞之琳同志解放后的某些诗作，恰好在“现代口语”的运用上表现了严重的缺点。他的解放后的诗作，主观上也许是力求摆脱外国格律的束缚，实际上仍然没有冲破欧化诗的局限。这当然不只是艺术形式上的问题，不过由此可见，一般地提出“在现代口语基础上建立格律诗”，不强调学习劳动人民的口语，学习劳动人民通过民歌形式锤炼口语、美化口语的能力，掌握节奏（“顿”）的习惯，那是很不够的。当然，我们也必须看到，卞之琳同志运用自己熟悉的形式，歌颂抗美援朝的伟大斗争，歌颂修建十三陵水库的人们的英勇劳动，这无论如何是值得欢迎的；甚至他过去写的歌颂抗日战争、歌颂延安的诗歌，其政治上的积极性也未可抹煞。我们相信卞之琳同志今后将以更大的热情投身到群众的革命洪流中，从思想感情上、也从艺术上不断地推陈出新，为人民群众写出更多更好的诗篇。
    新民歌是地平线上出现不久的新事物，人们一时不容易对它做出全面的估价。在民歌和古典诗歌基础上发展新诗，更是一个有待深入研究的课题。至于如何建立新鲜活泼的、多样化的诗歌的民族形式和现代格律诗，也包括了许多复杂问题。所有这些，都有待于进一步地展开讨论。在讨论的过程中，有时候看得偏一些，那就让我们互相提醒吧！在这篇文章里，我对于何其芳同志、卞之琳同志前此发表的意见，也很可能有领会得不充分、分析得不适当的地方，我的意见也可能看偏了，都希望得到两位同志和更多同志们的指正。在这篇文章里，我没有着重谈到承继“五四”以来新诗歌的革命传统，特别是吸取外国诗歌的经验，并不是要忽视这些重要问题。何其芳同志提醒我们要“敢于吸收世界许多国家的大诗人的作品的营养”；卞之琳同志提醒我们注意吸取“外国诗歌的可吸收的长处”；他们都反复提醒我们不要抛开了“五四”以来我国新诗歌的优良传统；这些提醒都是完全必要的。新诗歌的建设是一个大工程，我完全同意何其芳同志所说，我们应当有那种“千汇万状、兼古今而有之”的气魄。以新民歌和新诗现有的成就而自满，那是没有甚么道理的。我们需要发展，需要提高，这也不发生问题。根本问题在于找到便于发展、便于提高的坚实的基础，从这个基础上建筑宏伟的亭台楼阁，比较地更可靠些。经过讨论，如果对这一点取得了共同的认识，那就是不平常的收获了。
