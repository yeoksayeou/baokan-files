Xinhua News Agency report: Following the successful launch of the cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union, several prominent Soviet scientists have discussed the rocket’s significant scientific implications from various perspectives.

Academician Dorodnitsyn stated that humanity has reached the eve of “great cosmological discoveries.” He pointed out that to explore the mysteries of the moon and the universe, it is necessary to begin manufacturing spacecraft to carry exploration teams, which is the aim of the research work that began on October 4, 1957. To achieve this task, much more enormous and difficult work will undoubtedly be required, but it can be said that this work has shifted from the exploratory phase to the technical design phase.

　　Humans Will Be Able to Utilize Materials from Other Planets

Speaking of the value of cosmological discoveries, the scientist said that these discoveries are not merely for satisfying the interest in understanding the universe. The study of cosmic radiation and particle radiation plays an important role in understanding the structure of matter, and this research work has already made direct contributions to the utilization of nuclear reaction processes. Furthermore, the idea of humans utilizing various rare elements stored on other planets, which may be more abundant than on Earth, is by no means a castle in the air. The question, therefore, lies in finding appropriate methods to transport them back to Earth. Of course, we cannot yet guess how many new things humans will discover on other planets, but there is no doubt that humans will make good use of these new discoveries.

Dorodnitsyn said that the new year 1959 marked its beginning with an outstanding event. The world's first artificial planet broke free from the Earth's gravitational pull and will become a small but equal member of the solar system's planetary family. After emitting a bright cloud of sodium vapor at an altitude of 110,000 kilometers, people found and can see with the naked eye the road to the universe.

　　The Next Step Will Be to Peer Behind the Moon

Academician Fesenkov, a Soviet astronomer, particularly emphasized the importance of cosmic rockets for astronomical exploration, saying that discovering the moon’s magnetic field is fundamentally very important. Directly determining the intensity and quantity of heavy atomic nuclei components in the primordial cosmic rays in interplanetary space is also very important. If the ratio of heavy nuclear elements to protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei) there is the same as that found in interstellar space, then it can be assumed that cosmic rays are merely interstellar matter accelerated to almost the speed of light under the influence of our Milky Way's magnetic field.

Fesenkov said that the atmosphere extends much farther from Earth than generally believed until now. To solve this problem, rockets must be launched to a distance several Earth diameters away from the Earth's surface. Cosmic rockets can directly measure important materials such as the content of interplanetary gas and solar particle radiation.

Fesenkov believes that, without a doubt, more problems will be solved in the next step, such as using television to peek at the far side of the moon, which we do not yet know, and beginning to visit other cosmic bodies in the solar system.

　　Human Travel to Other Planets Will Become Reality

Academician Topchiev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, stated in an article published in the "Pravda" on the 5th: The Soviet Union's launch of artificial earth satellites was the first step in conquering the universe, the launch of cosmic rockets is the second major step into interplanetary space, and the third step – the mythical flight of humans to other planets – is also about to become a reality.

The article said that it is not yet possible to fully predict all the scientific data that interstellar flight of cosmic rockets will bring to mankind. But it can be said with certainty that human will is increasingly reaching beyond the Earth’s boundaries. Speed and momentum are the hallmarks of our era. In the past, centuries were needed to transition from one era to another, but now, just over a year since the first bright satellite appeared in the sky according to the will of the Soviet people, the second major step has been completed in interstellar flight. The huge size and weight of the Soviet cosmic rocket give us reason to believe that the third step will also become a reality.

　　The Artificial Planet Will Return Near the Earth

Professor Kukarkin, a renowned Soviet astronomer, said in an article published in the "Pravda": The first artificial planet launched by the Soviet Union may pass by its mother – the Earth – in its journey through the solar system in the future, and it is possible to see this small planet again on Earth.

Kukarkin said that the orbit of this small planet will pass near the starting point (a point on Earth's orbit) from which it began its flight into interplanetary space. Furthermore, it will frequently pass through this region close to Earth in the future, at which time it may be possible to observe this planet directly from Earth. If the rocket were to operate solely under the influence of the Sun's gravity, it would return very accurately to the starting point where it entered the orbit. However, due to its movement being affected by other celestial bodies in the solar system, it can only approach this starting point approximately.

　　Rocket Landing on the Moon is Entirely Possible

The article also stated that the mission of the first cosmic rocket was not to land on the moon. However, it is entirely possible to make a rocket land on the moon.

The article answered the question of why the Soviet rocket was launched towards the moon. It wrote that the moon is an object frequently observed by the scientific community, and studying the moon has great value, because we currently only understand one planet – Earth. The Soviet Union’s first interplanetary rocket can clarify some interesting questions: What is the moon's magnetic field like? What is the moon's radioactivity like? The resolution of these questions is of great value in expanding our knowledge of the nature of planets, the origin and development of planets.

Kukarkin continued, the question of the structure of the lunar surface layer has not yet been resolved. All data favors the idea that the lunar surface is actually covered with a layer of fine powder (the product of the collapse of the surface rock layer). The day is not far off when scientists will receive direct answers to the question of the structure of the lunar surface layer.

It can be seen that even the first flight of a cosmic rocket towards the moon will help solve a series of astronomical problems, which are of great significance for further spaceflight and for understanding the process of planetary development.

　　The Moon Can Serve as a Launching Point for Interstellar Flight

Kukarkin also mentioned Tsiolkovsky’s famous idea that the moon could be used as a basic launching ground for interplanetary flight in the future. Indeed, leaving the moon does not require overcoming a dense atmosphere, because there is virtually no atmosphere on the moon, nor does it require the rocket to reach a speed of more than 11 kilometers per second. Because the moon's gravity is only one-sixth of Earth's gravity, the second cosmic velocity for the moon is slightly less than 2 kilometers per second.

When discussing the future, this scientist emphasized that the first celestial body to be studied by direct human visits will, of course, be the moon. The proposal by Ukrainian astronomer Yakovenko to create artificial lunar satellites has not lost its significance. This is of great significance for solving a series of astronomical problems.

In recent years, the moon can be studied by directly going to the moon. At the same time, a lunar satellite can also be launched. This is not difficult.

    苏联科学家畅谈宇宙大事
    人定胜天
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联成功地发射了宇宙火箭之后，苏联许多著名的科学家就火箭的重大科学意义从不同方面作了论述。
    多罗德尼秦院士说，人类已经盼到了“宇宙学伟大发现”的前夕。他指出，要探索月球和宇宙奥秘，就必须着手完成制造运载考察队的宇宙飞船，这就是自1957年10月4日所开始的研究工作的目的。要实现这个任务，当然还需要做许多巨大而又困难的工作，但是可以这样说，这项工作已经从摸索、探求的阶段转入了技术设计的阶段。
    人类将能利用其它行星物质
    这位科学家在谈到宇宙学的发现的价值时说，这些发现并不只是为了满足认识宇宙的兴趣。研究宇宙辐射、微粒辐射对认识物质构造是有重要作用的，而且这些研究工作已经对利用核反应过程有了直接贡献。此外，人类利用其他行星上储存的可能比地球上还要多的各种稀有元素的设想，绝不是空中楼阁的幻想。所以问题在于用什么适当的方法把它们运到地球上来。当然人类究竟会在其他行星上发现多少新东西，我们还没法猜测，但毫无疑问，人类是会很好地利用这些新发现的。
    多罗德尼秦说，新的1959年以杰出的事件作了自己开始的标志。世界上第一个人造行星挣脱了地球引力作用的范围，并将成为太阳系行星大家庭中虽然小、但确是平等的一员。它在十一万公里的高空发出放亮的纳蒸气云之后，人们找到并且可以用肉眼看到通向宇宙的道路。
    下一步将窥视月球背后
    苏联天文学家费辛科夫院士特别着重地论述了宇宙火箭对天文学考察上的重要意义，他说，发现月球的磁场在原则上是十分重要的。直接在行星际空间确定原始宇宙线中重原子核成分的强度和数量也是非常重要的。如果在那里重核元素同质子（即氢核）的比例同在恒星际空间所发现都一样，那么可以认为，宇宙线只不过是一种在我们银河系磁场的作用下加速到几乎达到光速的恒星际物质。
    费辛科夫说，大气层从地球延伸出去的距离比直到现在一般人所认为的要远得多，要解决这个问题，必须把火箭发射到离地面有若干个地球直径的距离之外去。宇宙火箭即可直接测量行星际气体的含量和太阳微粒辐射等重要的材料。
    费辛科夫认为，毫无疑问，下一步将要解决更多的问题，如用电视窥视直到目前我们还不知道的月球背面的情况，和开始去拜访太阳系的其他宇宙体等。
    人游其它行星将成现实
    苏联科学院副院长托普切夫院士5日在“真理报”上发表的文章中说：苏联发射人造地球卫星是征服宇宙的第一个步骤，发射宇宙火箭是进入行星际空间的第二个重大步骤，而第三步——人到其它行星上去的神话般的飞行，也即将成为现实。
    文章说，现在还不能完全预言出宇宙火箭的星际飞行将给人类带来的各项科学资料。但可以确切地说，人类的意志将日益达到地球境界以外。速度和动力是我们时代的标志。过去为了从一个时代到另一个时代需要几世纪的时间，而现在自从天空按照苏联人民的意志出现了第一个明亮的卫星以来才一年多点时间，就在星际飞行中已完成了第二个重大的步骤了。苏联宇宙火箭的巨大体积和重量使我们有理由相信，第三步也将成为现实。
    人造行星会重返地球身旁
    苏联著名天文学家库卡尔金教授在“真理报”上发表的一篇文章中说：苏联发射的第一个人造行星今后在它太阳系的行程中，还可能经过它的母亲——地球的身旁，在地球上再看到这个小行星的可能性是存在的。
    库卡尔金说，这个小行星的轨道将通过它开始飞到行星际空间去时的出发点（地球运行轨道上的一点）附近。并且，今后它将经常通过这个同地球接近的地区，那时也许可以从地球上直接观察到这个行星。如果火箭仅仅在太阳引力的影响下运行，那么它将十分准确地回到它进入轨道时的出发点上来。但是由于它的运行将受到太阳系其他天体的影响，它只能大体上靠近这个出发点。
    火箭降落月球完全可能
    文章还说，第一个宇宙火箭的任务不是降落在月球上。但是使火箭降落在月球上已经是完全可能的。
    文章回答了为什么苏联火箭要向月球方向发射的问题。他写道，月球是科学界经常注意的对象，研究月球有很大价值，因为目前我们还只了解一个星球——地球。苏联第一个行星际火箭可以弄清楚一些有趣的问题：月球的磁场如何，月球的放射性如何。这些问题的解决，在扩大我们对行星本质、行星的发生和发展的知识方面，有很大价值。
    库卡尔金继续写道，关于月球表层的结构问题还没有解决。所有的资料都有利于认为月球表面实际上盖着一层细小粉末（表面岩层崩裂的产物）的说法。科学家对月球表层结构这个问题得到直接答复的日子已经不远了。
    由此可见，即使宇宙火箭向月球方向的第一次飞行，也就有助于解决一系列天文学问题，这些问题对进一步的宇宙飞行以及对认识行星发展的过程都有着重大的意义。
    月球可作星际飞行起飞点
    库卡尔金还提到齐奥尔科夫斯基关于将来可以把月球作为行星际飞行的基本起飞场这个有名的思想。的确，离开月球不需要克服稠密的大气，因为月球上实际不存在大气，也不需要使火箭达到每秒十一公里以上的速度。因为月球的引力只是地球引力的六分之一，对于月球来说，第二宇宙速度要略低于每秒二公里。
    这位科学家谈到将来的情况时强调指出，第一个被人用直接访问的方法来研究的天体，当然是月球。乌克兰天文学家雅科文科关于制造人造月球卫星的主张并未失去其意义。这对解决一系列天文学问题有着巨大意义。
    在最近年代就可以用直接到月球上去的方法来研究月球。同时也可以发射一个月球卫星。这是不困难的。
