Sun, Moon, Stars
Explanations of Some Astronomical Terms

    Celestial Sphere: The universe is boundless, and stars are scattered throughout this boundless space. However, when a person looks at the sky from a certain place on Earth, the sky appears as a vast, blue dome. Ancient people imagined this to be the actual state of the sky. When humans study celestial bodies from Earth, scientists also envision the sky as a giant sphere, based on human vision, to facilitate the explanation of the positions of stars visible to the naked eye. That is to say, astronomy retains the ancient people's hypothesis. In this hypothetical sphere, the Earth seems to be at the center of the large sphere. To better distinguish positions, many hypothetical lines are also drawn on the sphere.
    No matter where on the Earth's surface, the sky can be seen as a huge dome covering the ground, with the sun, moon, and stars distributed on the inner surface of the hemisphere. The sky as perceived by the naked eye is called the celestial sphere.
    Celestial Sphere: When we travel around the Earth from south to north, we can feel that the celestial sphere is not just a hemisphere, but like a large, integrated sphere. The Earth and the observer seem to be located at the center of this large sphere. To facilitate the explanation of the positions of stars visible to the naked eye, scientists also imagine the sky as such a sphere, calling it the celestial sphere, and drawing some hypothetical lines of longitude and latitude on the inner surface of this sphere.
    Celestial Equator: People who pay attention to observing the sky at night can discover that in the evening, stars in the east rise from the horizon, pass through the sky, and then set in the west in the morning, rotating once every day. It seems as if the "celestial sphere" with the stars hanging on it rotates around the Earth once a day. In reality, this is just an impression caused by the Earth's rotation. The Earth rotates from west to east, and from the perspective of someone standing on Earth, it looks like the celestial sphere rotates from east to west. The axis of rotation of the celestial sphere is also parallel to the axis of rotation of the Earth. The point where the axis of rotation of the celestial sphere intersects the celestial sphere is called the "celestial pole," with the southern one called the South Celestial Pole and the northern one called the North Celestial Pole. The North Celestial Pole is located near Polaris (the North Star). Just as the Earth has an equator, a circle formed by connecting many points on the celestial sphere that are equidistant from the two poles is called the celestial equator, also known as the celestial equator. The plane of the celestial equator coincides with the plane of the Earth's equator.
    Declination: Like the lines of longitude and latitude on Earth, to facilitate the explanation of the positions of stars in the celestial sphere, scientists have also drawn many lines on the celestial sphere that are parallel and perpendicular to the celestial equator. Lines parallel to the celestial equator are called declination. Declination is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Each of the areas from the equator to the two celestial poles is divided into ninety degrees, with degrees north of the equator being positive and degrees south being negative.
    Right Ascension: Lines perpendicular to the celestial equator are called right ascension. Scientists generally recognize a certain point (the vernal equinox) on the celestial equator as the starting point for right ascension (0 hours or 0 degrees), and measure eastward from there. Because the Earth rotates once in a day and night, right ascension is often measured in units of hours, minutes, and seconds, dividing the entire celestial sphere into twenty-four hours; however, it can also be measured in units of degrees, minutes, and seconds, dividing the entire celestial sphere into three hundred and sixty degrees.
    Perihelion and Aphelion: The orbits of all planets in the solar system around the sun are elliptical. The orbit of the first artificial planet launched by the Soviet Union around the sun is also elliptical. An ellipse has two focal points, and the sun is located at one of them. Therefore, the distance of a planet from the sun is not always the same during its orbit. The point on its orbit closest to the sun is called the perihelion, and the farthest point is called the aphelion.
    Orbital Period: The time it takes for a planet to revolve around the sun once in its elliptical orbit is called its orbital period or revolution period. According to celestial mechanics, the length of this period depends on the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (i.e., half of the orbit's maximum diameter). It is now known that the maximum diameter of the Soviet artificial planet's orbit is 343.6 million kilometers, so its orbital period can be calculated to be approximately fifteen months.
    Revolution and Rotation: The movement of one celestial body around another is called revolution. For example, the movement of the moon around the Earth is called the moon's revolution. The turning of a celestial body around an axis passing through itself is called rotation. For example, the Earth rotates once every day and night.
    Cosmic Rays: Cosmic rays are a type of radiation constantly emitted from outside the Earth. They possess great energy, and the possibility of studying celestial bodies very far from Earth by using them has attracted the attention of many scientists. From their origin to Earth, cosmic rays are affected by the medium through which they pass, and their composition and intensity change. According to data observed by balloons at an altitude of thirty kilometers, cosmic rays are mainly composed of hydrogen nuclei close to the speed of light, in addition to helium nuclei and heavier atomic nuclei such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei. People have also observed cosmic rays on the ground, including hydrogen nuclei, neutrons, mesons, electrons, photons (the basic particles that make up matter), etc., but with much lower energy. These are secondary particles produced by the interaction of cosmic ray particles with the Earth's atmosphere, and they can also be called secondary radiation.
    Where exactly do cosmic rays originate? Why do they have such great energy? Are the cosmic rays currently observed the original cosmic rays? These are all mysteries. Now that space rockets have escaped the Earth and entered outer space, the composition of cosmic rays obtained will be closer to the original cosmic radiation, and the energy will also be much greater.
    Research on cosmic rays is of great significance for elucidating the nature of atomic nuclei and nuclear forces.
    Solar Particle Radiation: In addition to radiating a large amount of light and heat, the sun also emits many high-speed charged particles (including negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons—i.e., hydrogen nuclei, and ions of other elements, etc.) called particle radiation. When these particles enter the Earth's magnetic field, they cause drastic changes in the Earth's magnetic field, and this change is called a magnetic storm. Particle radiation also causes the upper atmosphere to glow, which is the beautiful aurora.
    Solar particle radiation is absorbed by the air in the high-altitude atmosphere and cannot reach the ground. Therefore, direct measurements of these particle radiation need to be carried out on artificial satellites and artificial planets to clarify its nature, its intensity, the energy distribution of the particles, and the role of particle radiation in the formation of auroras.
    Perturbation: If there are only two spherical objects in space, then due to the force of gravity, they will move around their common center of gravity in a conic section (ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola). If there is a third celestial body at this time, due to the force of gravity, it will affect the movement of the original two objects, causing their movement to deviate from the original situation, which is called perturbation. When we launch a rocket from the Earth, it is initially mainly affected by the Earth. Later, when it approaches the moon, it is affected more by the moon (because the closer the distance, the stronger the gravitational force), resulting in a greater perturbation, which changes the rocket's orbit. This situation must be predicted when launching a rocket, and the moon's perturbation can be used to make the rocket enter a more suitable required orbit.

    日月星辰
    关于宇宙知识的一些名词解释
    天穹：宇宙是无边无际的，星星散布在这无边无际的宇宙中。但是人在地球上某一地方看天空，天空就好像是一个庞大的，蔚蓝色的圆顶。古人把这想像成天空的实际情况。当人类在地球上研究天体的时候，为了便于说明肉眼所看到的星星在天空的位置，科学家也根据人的视觉把天空设想为一个巨大的圆球。就是说，在天文学上保留了古人的假想。在这假想的圆球中，地球好像处于这个大圆球的中心，为了更好地区分位置，圆球上还作了许多设想的线。
    无论在地球表面什么地方，都可以看到天空像半个巨大的圆顶罩在地上，日月星辰都分布在半球的内表面。肉眼所感觉的这个天空就叫天穹。
    天球：当我们在地球上从南到北绕地球一圈，就可感觉到天穹并不止是一个半球，而像一个连成一体的大圆球。而地球和观测者则好像位于这个大圆球的中心。科学家们为了便于说明肉眼所看到的星星在天空中的位置，也就把天空假想为这么一个圆球，把它叫做天球，并把这个圆球内表面上作了一些假想的经纬线。
    天球赤道：夜间注意观测天空的人可以发现，傍晚，东方的星星从地平线升起经过天空，早上又向西边落下，每天转动一周。看来好像是悬挂着星星的“天球”每天绕地球一周一样。实际上这只是地球自转造成的印象。地球自西向东转，站在地球上看起来就像天球自东向西转。而天球自转的轴也恰好和地球自转的轴平行。天球自转的轴线同天球相交的点叫“天极”，南边的叫天球南极，北边的叫天球北极。天球北极就靠在北极星旁。像地球有赤道一样，把天球上同两极距离相等的许多点联接成的一个圆圈就叫天球赤道，也叫天赤道。天球赤道平面同地球赤道平面是吻合的。
    赤纬：像地球上的经线、纬线一样，为便于说明星星在天球中的位置，科学家又在天球上画了同天球赤道相平行和相垂直的许多线，同天球赤道相平行的线就叫赤纬。赤纬以度、分、秒为单位。从赤道到两个天极各划分为九十度，赤道以北为正度，以南为负度。
    赤经：同天球赤道相垂直的线就叫赤经。科学家们公认以天球赤道上某一点（春分点）作为赤经起算点（○时或○度），由此向东量度。因为地球自转一周为一昼夜，赤经经常以时、分、秒为单位，把全天球划为二十四时；但也可以度、分、秒为单位，把全天球划分为三百六十度。
    近日点和远日点：太阳系中一切行星围绕太阳运行的轨道都是椭圆形的。苏联发射的第一个人造行星围绕太阳运行的轨道也是椭圆的。椭圆有两个焦点，太阳位于其中的一个焦点上。因此行星在运行时同太阳的距离不是始终一样的。其轨道上离太阳最近一点叫近日点，最远一点叫远日点。
    运转周期　行星在其椭圆轨道上绕太阳旋转一周所需的时间，称为它的运转周期或公转周期。由天体力学知道这个周期的长度决定于行星轨道的半长轴。（即轨道的最大直径的一半），现在已知道苏联人造行星轨道的最大直径为三亿四千三百六十万公里，故可算出它的运转周期约为十五个月。
    公转和自转：一个天体围绕另一个天体运转称为公转，例如月亮绕地球的运转称为月亮的公转。一个天体绕着穿过它本身的轴线转动称为自转。例如地球每昼夜自转一次。
    宇宙射线　是由地球外面不断发射来的一种射线。它具有很大的能量，利用它就有可能研究离开地球非常远的天体，所以一直引起很多科学家的注意。宇宙线从发源地到地球的途中受到它所通过的介质的影响，辐射的成分和强度都有改变。根据气球在三十公里的高空所观测到的资料，宇宙线主要是由接近光速的氢核构成，此外有氦核和更重的原子核如碳、氮、氧核等等，人们在地面上也观测到宇宙线，有氢核、中子、介子、电子、光子（组成物质的基本粒子）等等，但能量小得多了，它们是由宇宙线粒子和地球大气层作用而产生的二次粒子，也可以把它们叫做二次辐射。
    宇宙线到底是在什么地方发生的呢？为什么有这样大的能量呢？目前观测到的宇宙线是否就是原始的宇宙射线？这些都是谜，宇宙火箭既然已经脱离地球而进入宇宙空间，那么所获得的宇宙线成份将更接近宇宙线的原始辐射，能量也将大得多。
    进行宇宙线方面的研究，对阐明原子核和原子核力的本质有很大的意义。
    太阳的微粒辐射　太阳除了辐射出大量的光和热以外，还发射出很多高速的带电粒子（包括带负电的电子，带正电的质子——即氢原子核，和其他元素的离子等等）叫做微粒辐射。这些粒子进入地球磁场就会引起地球磁场的剧烈变动，这种变动叫做磁暴。微粒辐射还使高层大气发光，这就是美丽的极光。
    太阳的微粒辐射在高空大气层中就被空气吸收了，不能到达地面，因此需要在人造卫星和人造行星上对这些微粒辐射进行直接测量，弄清楚它的本质，它的强度，微粒的能量分布，微粒辐射在形成极光中的作用等。
    摄动：如果空间只有两个球状的物体，那么由于万有引力的作用，它们将绕着共同的重心作圆锥曲线（椭圆、抛物线或双曲线）运动。如果这时有一个第三天体，由于万有引力作用，就会影响到原来两个物体的运动，使它们的运动偏离原来的情况，称为摄动。我们从地球上发射出一个火箭，起初它主要受着地球的影响，后来当它跑近月亮的时候，便受到月亮较大的影响（因为距离愈近时万有引力便愈强），产生较大的摄动，使这火箭的轨道发生变化，在发射火箭时须预计到这种情况。并且可以利用月亮的摄动使火箭进入更合适的要求的轨道。
