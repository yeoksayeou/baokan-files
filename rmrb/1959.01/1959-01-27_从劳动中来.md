Coming from Labor
By our reporter Zhu Jigong

A New Chapter in Lectures
One evening, Gao Wenzhong, an advanced worker and combined harvester driver from the Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine in Kailuan, and several miners were summarizing an experience where the roof was relatively fractured, requiring a special support method for the combined harvester to pass through smoothly. Some were sketching on the ground, while others were using wooden strips to simulate the supports... Finally, they identified the key problem. Students from the Beijing Mining College who participated in the discussion recorded these valuable materials and sketches. After nine days of discussion, the teachers, students, and miners of the college jointly compiled seven sections of lectures related to combined harvester coal mining work organization, pneumatic pick coal mining work organization, and support work for recovery work surfaces.

These seven sections of lectures form a chapter in the course "Production Organization and Planning of Mining Enterprises." During the compilation process, the majority of the discussion was conducted by the workers, with teachers and students assisting in analysis and recording. Sometimes, the workers even did the initial drafting themselves. One support worker wrote: "Coal mine production must first ensure the safety of workers' lives, so whether it is mechanized coal mining or manual coal mining, supports must be used to control the roof." This is much more profound than the original lecture, which only stated "to prevent the deformation of roadways" when explaining why supports should be used. Everyone believes that this part of the lecture contains both the experience of China's coal mine production, is written specifically and vividly, and is closely linked to the Party's policy of safe production, so the quality is relatively high, and the teachers are preparing to systematically organize it for use in teaching.

"Ten Years of Jingou Village"
Reading classics in the morning and farming in the afternoon,
Burning the midnight oil fighting for "ten years,"
Hanging hair and piercing thighs are romantic deeds,
How can they compare to wholeheartedly being red and expert.

Students from the fifth class of the fourth grade of the Planning Economics Department of Renmin University of China wrote this poem to describe their feelings while compiling the book "Ten Years of Jingou Village" with the help of farmers.

The students who came to Jingou Village in Fengtai District, a suburb of Beijing, to work and conduct learning and research were determined to record this tremendous change in the mountain village and the soaring enthusiasm of the local people. Wang Fengren, an old farmer who had been a hired laborer for more than fifty years and was over seventy years old, was happy to hear the news and said: "Good! When this book is finished, it can let our next generation know the suffering of the past and be educated." Many production team leaders and commune members also enthusiastically ran to the students and said that they would definitely help find any materials needed. In the movement of deep plowing, on the kangs, the college students and commune members unveiled the dark history of blood and tears before liberation. Feng Degui told students Liu Xiaoyu, Zhang Delin, and others that more than twenty years ago, his father carried a carrying pole with Feng Degui in front and his sister in the back, fleeing famine to Jingou Village, and the whole family had to work for the landlord to barely make ends meet. Feng Degui's mother talked to these young people about the scene before liberation and couldn't help but lift her trouser legs, which were covered with scars from being bitten by the landlord's vicious dog. After talking with Fan Shuzhen, the leader of the women's production group, students such as Li Ning learned that this middle-aged woman in her forties had also suffered deeply from oppression in the old society. One of her children had starved to death, but after liberation, her two children went to elementary school and middle school and even bought bicycles. The students had previously learned what exploitation and surplus value were in courses such as political economy, and the changes in rural areas... but they had a deeper understanding during this book-writing process.

This 50,000-word booklet, which reflects the rapid changes in Jingou Village in terms of economy, culture, and other aspects, is prepared to be published after being reviewed and revised by teachers.

The Birth of a Farmer's Philosophy Textbook
In a room in Changgou People's Commune, Zhoukoudian District, commune members often gathered, some squeezed on the kang, and some moved benches and sat against the wall. A teacher counted the clappers: "Seeking truth from facts is the most important thing, doing a good job is the first thing, opposing idealism and emphasizing materialism, and discarding subjectivism, you must not think out of thin air in everything, combine the objective and the subjective, conduct investigation and research beforehand, and you will surely do a good job." Then, he began to talk about the principle of "seeking truth from facts" in philosophy, and the commune members sometimes laughed, sometimes whispered to each other, and listened with great interest.

The Philosophy Teaching and Research Section of the Department of Political Education of Beijing Normal University is compiling a philosophy textbook while doing philosophy popularization work in rural areas. When they first started teaching philosophy, the content was not practical, the language was not vivid enough, and it did not arouse the interest of the peasants. Several teachers prepared to talk about the issue of subjective initiative. After studying it several times, they always felt that it was not vivid or popular. A commune cadre said: "In my opinion, subjective initiative is enthusiasm plus persistence. We must have soaring enthusiasm in handling affairs and working, and we must also understand the situation and think of ways. For example, in deep plowing, enthusiasm is not enough. We also need to look at the terrain, rationally organize the labor force, and improve the tools..." In this way, the content is substantial, and the peasants are willing to listen. Some teachers lived in the same courtyard as an old woman from a poor peasant background. Once, when talking about the issue of ghosts and gods, the old woman said: "Respecting gods is like gods are present, believe it or not," and the teachers used this simple materialist idea as an example to analyze and improve it, explaining the principle that "there are no ghosts and gods in the world," which was welcomed by everyone.

While lecturing to peasants, the teachers of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Section, together with some students, compiled a farmer's philosophy textbook, with a total of eighteen topics, including learning philosophy to eliminate superstition, success depends on human effort, man can conquer nature, seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times, seeing a hundred times is better than doing once, bad things can turn into good things, nine fingers and one finger, and so on.

    从劳动中来
    本报记者　朱继功
    讲义中新的一章
    一天晚上，开滦唐家庄煤矿的先进工作者康拜因司机高文忠，和几个矿工总结一次顶板比较破碎，必须用特殊的支架方法，才能使康拜因顺利通过的经验。有的趴在地上画草图，有的拿着木条当支架比划着……最后终于找到了关键问题。参加讨论的北京矿业学院的学生就把这些可贵的材料和草图记录了下来。经过九天的讨论，这个学院的师生和矿工们一起编成了有关康拜因采煤工作组织、风镐落煤工作组织、回采工作面的支架工作等七节讲义。
    这七节讲义合为“采矿企业生产组织与计划”课程中的一章。在编写过程中，大部由工人们讨论，师生们帮助分析、记录，有时也由工人自己先行编写。一位支架工写道：“煤矿生产首先要保证工人的生命安全，所以不论是机器采煤或人工采煤，必须采用支架来控制顶板。”这比原来的讲义在阐述为什么要用支架时只说是“为了防止井巷的变形”深刻多了。大家认为这部分讲义既有我国煤矿生产的经验，写得也具体生动，并且密切结合了党的安全生产的方针，所以质量比较高，教师们准备系统整理后就在教学中运用。
    “金沟庄十年”
    朝读经典午下田，
    彻夜灯边战“十年”，
    悬梁锥股风流事，
    怎敌心向红又专。
    中国人民大学计划经济系四年级第五班学生写了这首诗来描述他们在农民的帮助下，编写“金沟庄十年”一书时的心情。
    来到京郊丰台区金沟庄边劳动、边进行学习和调查研究的学生，决心要把这山乡巨变和当地人民的冲天干劲记载下来。当了五十多年的长工、年逾七旬的老农王凤仁听到这个消息高兴地说：“好啊！这本书写成了，可以让咱们下一代晓得从前的苦难，受到教育”。好多生产队长、社员也热情跑来对学生说，需要啥材料，一定帮着找。大学生和社员们在深翻土地的运动中，在炕头上，一幕幕地揭开了解放前暗无天日的血泪史，冯德贵对学生刘晓余、张德林等人说，二十多年前他父亲挑着一副担子，前面坐着冯德贵，后面坐着他妹妹，从家乡逃荒到了金沟庄，一家子都为地主干活才勉强得以糊口。冯德贵母亲同这些年轻人谈起解放前的光景，不禁撩起裤管，她的腿上尽是地主家恶狗咬的伤疤。经过和妇女生产组长范淑贞的交谈，李宁等学生才知道这位四十多岁的中年妇女原来在旧社会也深受压迫，她曾有个孩子活活被饿死了，但解放后她的两个孩子上了小学、中学，还买了自行车。学生们以前在学政治经济学等课程中，也知道什么是剥削、什么是剩余价值，农村变化情况……但在这段写书过程中才有了更深刻的体会。
    这本从经济、文化等各个方面反映金沟庄急遽变化的五万字的小册子，准备由教师审改后出版。
    农民哲学课本的诞生
    在周口店区长沟人民公社的一间屋子里，社员们经常聚会，有的挤在炕上，有的搬来条凳倚墙而坐。一个教师数起了快板：“实事求是最重要，作好工作头一条，反对唯心讲唯物，主观主义要丢掉，万事不能凭空想，客观主观结合好，事前调查又研究，工作一定能搞好。”接着，他就开讲哲学中“实事求是”的道理，社员们时而发出笑声，时而低头交谈，听得津津有味。
    北京师范大学政治教育系哲学教研室在农村中边作哲学普及工作，边编写哲学课本。他们刚开始讲哲学，内容不切实际，语言不够生动，引不起农民的兴趣。有几个教师准备讲主观能动作用的问题，研究了好几次，总感到不生动、不通俗。一个社干部说：“依我看，主观能动作用就是干劲加钻劲。咱们办事、干活既要有冲天干劲，也必须摸情况，想办法，譬如深翻地，有了干劲还不算，还需要看地势，合理地组织劳动力，改良工具……。”这样，内容充实，农民愿意听。有的教师和一位贫农出身的老大娘住在一个院子，一次谈到鬼神问题时，老大娘说：“敬神如神在，信则有不信则无”，教师们就运用这朴素的唯物主义思想的实例，加以分析、提高，讲“世界上没有鬼神”的道理，受到大家的欢迎。
    哲学教研室教师在为农民讲课的同时，和部分学生结合写成了农民哲学课本，共有破除迷信学哲学，事在人为、人定胜天，百闻不如一见、百见不如一作，坏事能够变成好事，九个指头与一个指头等十八个专题。（附图片）
