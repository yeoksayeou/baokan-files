Ode to the Spring Oriole in the World
Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu

    I. The vast and dark outer space, a path untrodden by humans,
    Through long nights, cold light dies and then ignites again,
    Only the stars have passed through.
    Breaking the eternal silence,
    The spring oriole flies to the world,
    Its song spreads throughout the land,
    Reporting the victory of peace!

    II. The red rocket has great skills,
    Catching up with the stars, catching up with the moon.
    Millions of kilometers in a single stride,
    Humans traveling the universe is no longer a mere fantasy.
    Glory to Marxism-Leninism!
    Glory to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    The black rocket is an embarrassment,
    Blowing and blowing, it still can't get off the ground,
    Vainly calling upon God and the Holy Mother,
    Scampering to the Atlantic in fear.
    What is declining is capitalism,
    It is the sun setting in the west! (Attached picture)

    人间春莺颂
    袁水拍诗  华君武画
    其一万里太空冥冥，此路人迹未经，长夜寒光灭又明，走过的只有星星。惊破永恒寂寞，飞来人间春莺，鸣声传遍天下，报道和平战胜！
    其二红色火箭本领强，赶上星星赶月亮。百万公里一举步，人游宇宙非空想。光荣归于马列主义！光荣归于苏联共产党！黑色火箭活现眼，一吹再吹吹不上，空唤上帝圣母娘，抱头鼠窜大西洋。没落的是资本主义，它是西山的太阳！（附图片）
