Shaanxi Imparts Technology to Improve Fertilizer Quality
Jiangsu Cultivates Green Manure, Striving for 10,000 Jin per Mu

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 26th dispatch) Shaanxi is strengthening technical guidance in fertilizer accumulation and production to improve fertilizer quality and fully utilize its effectiveness. Currently, various regions are utilizing methods such as holding training classes, convening on-site meetings, imparting various techniques for accumulating, producing, preserving, and applying fertilizer, and summarizing and promoting advanced technical experiences among the masses during the mass fertilizer accumulation movement. The Yan'an Agricultural Experiment Station sent personnel to other areas to study the technology of smoked fertilizer and also formed a working group with the Prefectural Agricultural and Forestry Bureau to summarize the stove-style smoked fertilizer technology at the Yan'an Happiness Commune, transmitting it to the entire region through a telephone conference. Responsible persons from the CCP Yanchang County Committee went deep among the masses to summarize the experience of fermenting fertilizer by mixing one fertilizer, one water, and two soils in a closed manner, increasing efficiency threefold and greatly improving fertilizer quality. Various regions have also implemented technical quotas and quality quotas based on advanced technical experiences to improve fertilizer quality. Weinan County universally promoted the quality quota that pig manure should not contain soil clods, greatly improving the quality of pig manure.

Combining mass fertilizer accumulation and production with scientific and technical guidance to improve fertilizer quality is an important experience gained in Shaanxi Province's fertilizer accumulation and production last year. When agricultural cooperatives across the province established indigenous chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale, the Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Northwest Agricultural College, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Chemical Industry Bureau, and other relevant units dispatched more than three thousand agricultural scientific workers and technicians to conduct investigations and research in various regions, analyze, test, and appraise all products, and then provide technical guidance in various areas throughout the province, improving the quality of fertilizer production by the masses and avoiding losses in fertilizer effectiveness and manpower. The Chemical Industry Bureau also dispatched technical cadres to help indigenous chemical fertilizer plants in Hanzhong, Ningqiang, Pucheng, Chang'an, and other places research and solve technical problems related to producing indigenous chemical fertilizers using local materials, successfully trial-producing calcium superphosphate, potash fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, and other indigenous chemical fertilizers, providing experience for indigenous chemical fertilizer plants to break out of the cycle of producing fertilizer with fertilizer and to further engage in regular production. Relevant units also summarized the experience of rapid high-temperature steaming fertilizer from the masses in Lantian County and conducted scientific analysis and testing of samples, promoting it throughout the province to improve fertilizer production efficiency and fertilizer quality. Relevant units also held technical training classes for bacterial fertilizers at all levels and convened on-site meetings, enabling the production of bacterial fertilizers to be widely carried out throughout the province. In addition, various regions have also summarized and promoted techniques for separating and accumulating ash manure, covering toilets, sealing manure piles with mud, applying human waste and urine with manure trucks, applying human waste and urine in combination with irrigation, and applying fertilizer in layers when deep plowing, protecting and maximizing fertilizer effectiveness.

The relevant departments of Shaanxi Province have decided to take the following measures to improve fertilizer quality and maximize fertilizer effectiveness: the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry will establish a Land Utilization Division and further collaborate with the Chemical Industry Bureau, the Department of Commerce, and other relevant leading departments to strengthen technical leadership in fertilizer work; organize agricultural scientific research departments and agricultural scientific workers throughout the province to participate in the mass fertilizer accumulation movement and help solve technical problems in fertilizer accumulation; all regions should train fertilizer technicians for the communes and summarize and promote advanced technical experiences in improving fertilizer quality and maximizing fertilizer effectiveness in their respective areas, based on local conditions; all communes should establish quality quotas and promote good operating methods in accumulating, producing, preserving, and applying fertilizer, with dedicated personnel responsible for inspection, and include quality as an important element in evaluations and competitions.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th dispatch) "Protect green manure in winter, it grows well in spring, have base fertilizer for summer planting, and high yields in autumn harvest." While vigorously managing the three wheat crops, people's communes in Jiangsu Province are strengthening the field management of green manure, striving to double the yield per mu compared to last year, aiming for the 10,000 jin target, and preparing sufficient base fertilizer for autumn crops.

Green manure is the main base fertilizer for autumn crops in Jiangsu. Last autumn, the province sowed a total of over 8.2 million mu of green manure crops such as milk vetch, goldflower clover, and common vetch, an increase of more than 50% compared to the green manure sowing area in 1957. The sowing quality was better than in previous years, with dense planting, and the sowing amount was also about doubled compared to the past. Currently, seedling emergence is generally good, with an average of 50 to 60 seedlings per square foot.

Protecting seedlings through the winter is the central task of green manure field management at present. In order to increase soil temperature and reduce frost damage, many places leave cotton stalks unpulled or pull them late on green manure fields that were originally cotton fields; some green manure fields are covered with chopped straw and garbage, and additional winter fertilizer is applied, with ditches opened and soil returned to protect the green manure and ensure safe overwintering. Many places have also formulated high-yield targets and specific measures for green manure, striving for high yields on every mu.

The Party committees in many places attach great importance to the field management of green manure. The CCP Jintan County Committee specifically put forward specific requirements for green manure field management, initially formulated operating procedures for field management, rationally arranged labor, and established specialized teams and responsibility systems. The CCP Yangzhong County Committee requires that each commune have about 20% of the summer crop field management personnel specializing in green manure in terms of labor arrangements. Since the beginning of winter, the communes in Yangzhong County have taken various frost prevention measures based on the characteristic of green manure's susceptibility to frost, protecting the green manure and ensuring safe overwintering. All green manure fields have been topdressed with smoked soil and pig and sheep manure four times, with an average topdressing of more than 1,600 dan per mu, and have been universally watered with night soil once or twice. Some have also built small earth kilns in the fields to smoke and prevent frost. (Attached picture)

    陕西传授技术提高肥料质量
    江苏培育绿肥力争亩产万斤
    本报西安26日电　陕西各地加强积肥制肥中的技术指导，以提高肥料质量，充分发挥肥效。目前，各地都在群众的积肥运动中运用举办训练班，召开现场会议，传授积肥、制肥、保肥、施肥的各种技术，总结推广群众中先进的技术经验。延安农业试验站派人到外地研究了熏肥的技术问题，还同专署农林局组成工作组，到延安幸福公社总结了灶式熏肥的技术，通过电话会议向全区作了传授。中共延长县县委负责人深入到群众中去总结一肥一水二土搅拌封闭发酵的沤肥经验，效率提高三倍，肥料质量也大大提高。各地还根据一些先进的技术经验，实行了技术定额和质量定额以提高肥料质量。渭南县普遍推行了猪肥中没有土块的质量定额后，猪肥的质量大大提高。
    把群众性积肥制肥和科学技术指导结合起来以提高肥料质量，是陕西省去年进行积肥制肥中的一条重要经验。当全省各地农业社大办土化肥厂时，农业科学院陕西分院、西北农学院、农林厅、化工局等有关单位，曾抽调三千多个农业科学工作者和技术人员，到各地进行调查研究，对所有产品进行了分析、化验和鉴定，然后又在全省各地分片进行技术指导，提高了群众制肥的质量，避免了肥效和人力的损失。化工局还抽调技术干部分别到汉中、宁强、蒲城、长安等地帮助当地县或社办的土化肥厂，研究解决就地取材进行土化肥生产的技术问题，成功地试制出过磷酸钙、钾肥、硫铵等土化肥，为土化肥厂跳出以肥制肥的圈子，为进一步进行经常生产提供了经验。有关单位还总结了蓝田县群众高温速成蒸肥经验，并进行了样品的科学分析化验，在全省推广后，提高了制肥效率和肥料的质量。有关单位还层层举办了细菌肥料的技术训练班，召开现场会议，使细菌肥料的生产在全省普遍开展。此外，各地还总结推广了灰粪分积、厕所加盖、粪堆泥封以及粪车施人粪尿、人粪尿与灌溉结合施肥、深翻地中分层施肥等保肥、施肥的技术，保护和发挥了肥效。
    陕西省有关部门决定采取下列措施，以提高肥料质量和发挥肥效：省农林厅成立土地利用处并与化工局、商业厅等有关领导部门进一步协作，加强肥料工作的技术领导；组织全省农业科学研究部门和农业科学工作者，投入群众积肥运动，帮助解决积肥中的技术问题；各地都要为公社训练肥料技术人员，并因地制宜地总结推广当地各种提高肥料质量、发挥肥效的先进技术经验；各个公社在积肥制肥保肥和施肥中，建立质量定额和推行好的操作方法，专人负责检查，在开展评比中把比质量列为重要内容之一。
    新华社南京26日电　“冬把绿肥保，开春生长好，夏种有基肥，秋收产量高”。江苏省各地人民公社在大抓三麦田间管理的同时，加强对绿肥的田间管理，争取每亩产量比去年翻一番，向万斤指标进军，为秋熟作物准备充足的基肥。
    绿肥是江苏秋熟作物的主要基肥。全省去秋共播种紫云英、金花菜、苕子等绿肥作物八百二十多万亩，比1957年绿肥秋播面积增加50％以上。播种质量比往年好，进行了密植，播种量也比过去增加一倍左右。现在一般出苗良好，平均一平方尺有苗五十棵到六十棵。
    护苗越冬是当前绿肥田间管理的中心任务。许多地方为增加地温，减轻冻害，对原来是棉田的绿肥田，迟拔或不拔棉秸；对有些绿肥田加盖了碎草、垃圾，并增施腊肥，开沟复土，保护绿肥安全过冬。很多地方还制定出绿肥的高产指标和具体措施，争取亩亩高产。
    许多地方的党委组织很重视绿肥的田间管理工作。中共金坛县委专门提出了绿肥田间管理的具体要求，初步制定了田间管理操作规程，合理安排了劳动力，建立起专业队和责任制。中共扬中县委要求各公社在劳动力安排上，有20％左右的夏熟作物田间管理人员专管绿肥。入冬以来，扬中县各公社根据绿肥怕冻的特点，采取了各项防冻措施，保护绿肥安全过冬。全部绿肥田已追施熏土、猪羊粪等暖性肥料四次，平均每亩追肥一千六百多担，并普遍用水粪浇过一次到二次，有的还在田头筑起小土窑，熏烟防冻。（附图片）
