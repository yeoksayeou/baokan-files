She Stayed
    Wang Xiuzhong
    Ren Xiaoqiu has been working in the countryside here for almost half a year. As soon as she arrived, she threw herself into the intense battles of the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and deep plowing of wheat fields. She had no time to think about home, nor did she want to go back. Now that the people's commune's winter canal construction task is nearing completion, she heard that there would be a few days off for the Spring Festival, so she prepared to go home for a visit. The two pounds of peanuts the commune gave each person for New Year's Day, she couldn't bear to eat, so she roasted them and put them in a small tin can, ready to take them back for her husband to eat. The local specialties she asked someone to buy, two pounds of seedless small red dates, she also took out and dried more than once; these were for her mother.
    This evening, Xiaoqiu was alone in the house, singing a new song under the lamp, preparing to teach it to the commune members. Suddenly, the door curtain rustled, and Auntie Li, the military dependent from next door, came in, saying, "Good girl, I want to discuss something with you, will you agree?" Xiaoqiu thought she wanted her to write a letter again, and replied with a smile, "I agree!" Auntie Li then leaned closer and said seriously, "Come to our house for the reunion dinner on New Year's Eve, everything is ready!" It turned out that since Ren Xiaoqiu came to the countryside, seeing that there were no young people in their family, she always carried one or two loads of water for Auntie Li after work every day. On her days off, she also wrote a letter to her son in the army for her. Once, Grandpa developed a high fever in the middle of the night, and Xiaoqiu braved the wind and snow to walk several miles to the clinic to fetch a doctor. Auntie Li liked her very much, always saving the good food for her, and usually calling her "good girl" all the time. Xiaoqiu also treated her like her own mother. At this moment, Xiaoqiu originally wanted to tell her that she was going home, but looking at Auntie Li's expectant face, she couldn't bear to disappoint the old lady, hesitated for a moment, and had to say, "It's still early, let's talk about it another day!" But the old lady insisted that she agree.
    Just as things were at an impasse, a group of young men suddenly poured in, laughing and joking, all talking at once, asking Xiaoqiu to perform in a play.
    It turned out that the village's drama troupe had been unusually active these past two days, busy rehearsing songs and dances and performing operas, preparing to participate in the commune's Spring Festival performances, wanting to have a great time performing for several nights in the first year of the people's commune's creation, and celebrating grandly. Whenever the commune members engaged in cultural activities, Ren Xiaoqiu was indispensable. It was indeed the case that everyone within a radius of twenty miles up and down the dam knew the sent-down cadre Ren Xiaoqiu, whose singing was so good, almost as good as the singing in the movies. Every time there was a mass meeting or a break in the fields, the villagers would always welcome her to sing a few songs. She could sing all the good new songs. The old folks all said, "Listening to Little Qiu sing like that, my heart feels even brighter." The young people joked, "Comrade Ren is singing the truth, so you won't be able to avoid listening." This time, everyone thought of Ren Xiaoqiu first when it came to putting on a show, and they came to find her after dinner.
    At this moment, militia captain Liu Yong shouted, "Comrade Ren, quickly teach us some new songs, so we can sing them during the New Year." As he spoke, he began to hum and sing. Auntie Li also said, "Next time, good girl, teach me one too, and I'll also give a stage performance during the New Year!" When the old lady said this, the room burst into laughter. Youth League Secretary Zhentian said seriously, "Comrade Ren, we're going to put on a play for the Spring Festival, but no one knows anything about directing..." Before he could finish speaking, the impatient Xiuying interrupted, "Sister Qiu, we also want to rehearse 'Bitter Vegetable Flowers', and we've all decided that you'll play Juanzi, you must agree, otherwise everyone won't be motivated to perform." "Really, Comrade Ren, you must take the lead this time!" At this time, the little guy Hei San ran over and threw himself into Xiaoqiu's arms, staring at her with his small eyes and shouting, "Auntie Qiu, you should teach us the horse-drawn carriage dance this New Year." Everyone spoke one after another, getting more and more excited. Seeing the pairs of expectant eyes and the warm and sincere faces under the lamplight, Xiaoqiu's heart felt warm. She thought: going back is just to see my husband and mother, but staying here has greater significance. She recalled the red and expert plan she had made before going to the countryside: "Always be of one heart with the peasants, and be a good propagandist for the Party." Isn't the large-scale cultural activities carried out during the Spring Festival the best time to publicize the Party's policies and praise the people's commune? Thinking of this, she said excitedly, "Okay! Comrades, let's all work together to put on a show, and be sure to have a happy Spring Festival!"
    The next day, after she mailed a package to the city, she went to the theater troupe as usual, singing happily all the way.

    她留下来了
    王秀中
    任小秋下放到这里快半年了。一下来就投入了紧张的秋收、秋种、深翻麦田的战斗，没顾得想家，也不想回去。现在人民公社冬季修渠的任务眼看就要完成，听说春节要放几天假，她就准备回去一趟。元旦时社里发给每人的两斤花生，她舍不得吃，炒熟了装在小铁罐里，准备带回去给爱人吃。托人买来的当地土产，两斤无核小红枣也端出来晒了不止一次了，这是带给母亲的。
    这天晚上，小秋一个人在屋里，对着灯光学唱一支新歌，准备教给社员们唱。忽然门帘一响，隔壁军属李大娘进来了，说道：“好闺女，我跟你商量件事，你答应不？”小秋以为又是找她写信哩，忙笑着回话：“答应呀！”大娘这才凑过脸来，郑重其事地说：“年三十上我们家吃团圆饭去，东西全都备齐啦！”原来任小秋自下放以来，瞧他们家没年青人，每天下工后，总是给大娘挑一两担水，逢上休息日，还替她写一封信给部队的儿子。有一次，大爷在半夜里发起了高烧，小秋就冒着风雪走几里地到卫生院里请来了医生。大娘喜欢她得不行，吃什么好的全要给她留着，平常好闺女前、好闺女后地叫个不停。小秋也把她当自己母亲一样看待。这会儿，小秋本想告她要回家，但看看大娘一脸盼望的样子，不忍拂她老人家意，沉吟了一下，只得说：“还早呢，改日再说吧！”可是老人家非让她答应不可。
    正在难解难分的时候，忽地涌进来一群小伙子，笑着闹着，七张八嘴，要小秋去演戏。
    原来这两天村里的剧团空前活跃，忙着排歌舞、演戏曲，准备参加公社春节会演，要在人民公社这开天辟地的第一年，痛痛快快地演它几个晚上，大大庆祝一番。社员们一搞文娱活动，就少不了任小秋。确实是这样，坝头上下方圆二十几里，谁不知道下放干部任小秋，唱的那叫好哇，简直跟电影里唱的不差上下。哪次开群众大会或是地里打歇的工夫，老乡们总要欢迎她来几曲。什么好听的新歌她都会唱。老人家们都说：“听小秋姑娘这么一唱哇，我心里就更加亮堂了。”年青人打趣说：“任同志是唱着曲子讲道理，不怕你听不进去。”这次要搞节目，大伙首先想到了任小秋，吃罢晚饭就找来了。
    这会儿，民兵队长刘勇嚷着说：“任同志呀，快教我们几个新歌，过年好唱。”说着自己哼哼依依地唱了起来。大娘也说：“赶明儿好闺女也教大娘一个，过年的时候，我也来个登台表演！”老人家这么一说，屋里哄的一下笑开了。团支书振田一本正经地说：“任同志，咱们春节要演戏，可是谁也不会导演什么的……”没等他把话讲完，急性子的秀英就插进嘴来：“秋姐姐，我们还要排‘苦菜花’呢，都决定你演娟子了，你可一定得答应，不然大家都演不带劲了。”“真的，任同志，这会你可得领头搞啊！”这时小家伙黑三跑过去一头栽在小秋怀里，瞪着小眼睛冲她直叫：“秋阿姨，这会过年你该教我们跳马车舞了。”大伙你一言我一语，越说越起劲。看到这灯光下一对对期待的目光，一张张热烈真挚的脸，小秋心里热呼呼的，心想：回去呢，只不过是看看爱人和母亲，可是在这里却有更大的意义。她回忆起自己临下放前订的红专规划：“永远和农民一条心，要做党的好宣传员。”眼前春节开展大规模的文娱活动，不正是宣传党的政策、歌颂人民公社的最好时机吗？想到这里，她兴奋地说了：“好！同志们，我们大家一起来搞节目，一定要欢欢乐乐地过这个春节！”
    第二天，她往市里寄去了一只包裹之后，又像往常一般，一路兴高采烈地唱着到剧团去了。
