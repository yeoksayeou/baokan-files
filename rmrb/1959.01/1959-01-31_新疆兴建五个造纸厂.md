Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Five paper mills with daily outputs of ten, thirty, and forty tons are under construction in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Some of the factory buildings and employee dormitories have been basically completed. Among them, the three paper mills in Shihezi, Urumqi, and Yili, with daily outputs of forty and ten tons, will be completed and put into production within this year. Currently, the preparatory units of these paper mills have transferred personnel to brother factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Andong for training in preparation for production.

    This year, the Xinjiang Light Industry Bureau has listed the establishment of the paper industry as one of the key construction projects of light industry. Xinjiang had no paper industry foundation in the past. Except for some locally produced paper made by the people using indigenous methods, all industrial paper was transported from other regions. In order to rapidly meet Xinjiang's local needs for various types of paper, in addition to building five medium-sized paper mills, plans are also in place to establish a number of small paper mills with daily outputs of one or two tons and indigenous paper mills in various special districts and autonomous prefectures.

    新疆兴建五个造纸厂
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区有五个日产十吨、三十吨和四十吨的造纸厂动工兴建。有的厂房和职工宿舍已经基本建成。其中石河子、乌鲁木齐和伊犁三个日产四十吨和十吨的造纸厂，将在今年内建成投入生产。现在，这些纸厂的筹建单位为了准备生产，已经调人到上海、天津、沈阳和安东等兄弟厂进行培训。
    今年，新疆轻工业管理局把建立造纸工业列为轻工业的重点建设之一。新疆过去没有造纸工业基础，除民间用土法制造一些土纸以外，所有工业用纸都是从外地运来的。为了迅速满足新疆地方对各种纸张的需要，除了建立五个中型纸厂以外，还准备在各专区、自治州建立一些日产一两吨的小型造纸厂和土法造纸厂。
