　　Concentrate the Wisdom of the Masses to Find Effective Measures
　　Tianjin's Broad Masses of Workers Discuss Production Plans
　　Many Factories Prepare for First Quarter Production and an Even Greater Leap Forward Throughout the Year

　　(Our report) Tianjin – Many factories and enterprises in Tianjin have successively handed over this year's first-quarter production plans to the broad masses of workers for extensive discussion, finding various effective measures to prepare for achieving an even greater leap forward this year.

　　In order to base production targets on foundations that are both advanced and reliable, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin put forward the battle cry of "Ten-point targets, twelve-point measures." Following this, workers in over two hundred factories in the Hexi, Heping, and Hedong districts discussed the first-quarter and January production plans. The workers in each factory were filled with enthusiasm, expressing their confidence and determination to complete the plan on big-character posters and in discussion meetings. They also proposed solutions to address some of the weak links in production. At the People's Paper Mill, due to insufficient raw materials, four of the factory's nine paper machines were to be shut down in the first quarter. During the discussion, veteran workers suggested using the stock of wood pulp to trial-produce new varieties such as ribbed paper. At the No. 3 Cotton Spinning Factory, a large quantity of fine yarn had to be produced this year. When the workers discussed the plan, they identified the main shortcomings in last year's fine yarn production as insufficient workshop hygiene, which led to a high rate of yarn breakage. Some workers posted big-character posters, expressing their determination to achieve "clean machines, clean floors, and clean ceilings," improve hygiene, and reduce the breakage rate.

　　"Vigorously carry out technical revolution and improve work efficiency" and "Actively overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment" were slogans put forward by many factories in discussing or arranging the first-quarter plan. The city's steelworkers are to produce 100,000 tons of steel for the country in the first quarter. The workers proposed to vigorously attack technical bottlenecks, overcome the difficulties brought about by high-sulfur earthy iron ore, so that the quality and output of steel can take off together, and also produce some new varieties of high-quality steel. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient supply of certain raw materials, the chemical industry system will produce 41 kinds of raw materials itself in the first quarter in accordance with the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. For example, the use of indigenous methods to produce soda ash will reach more than 1,600 tons in the first quarter. At the same time, comprehensive utilization will be carried out to recover waste materials and make up for the shortage of raw materials.

　　In order to adapt to this year's production leap forward, many factory workers are building equipment and arming themselves. In addition to producing 150-ton and 200-ton Lancashire boilers, chemical industry equipment, and smelting equipment in the first quarter of this year, the Tianjin Boiler Factory will also produce new products—65-ton and 35-ton medium-pressure power generation boilers—according to the urgent needs of national construction. The total output value of this factory in the first quarter is equivalent to 288% of the same period last year. The workers are full of confidence in completing the plan, and they are vigorously carrying out technical revolution to solve key production problems. In the past, riveting and welding operations mostly used manual labor, with very little mechanical equipment. The heavy iron plates were also transported manually within the factory. During the discussion of this year's first-quarter plan, workers in the boiler workshop and the general workshop began to design and manufacture simple riveting mechanical equipment and lifting equipment, and the machine workshop also manufactured simple machine tools according to the production tasks for the first quarter.

　　In order to ensure the realization of a good start this spring, many factories have also launched labor competitions to save raw materials and improve product quality. After discussing this year's first-quarter production plan, the workers of the Renli Wool Weaving Factory quickly launched a labor competition centered on saving raw materials and increasing production. In some factories, even in the face of shortages of certain raw materials, workers remain confident, finding ways to save raw materials and adopt substitutes, and cooperating with brother factories and other regions, supporting each other. The Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory decided to send people to Guangxi and other places to find wild hemp fibers to ensure the supply of raw materials, and also actively undertook processing tasks. The No. 5 Glass Factory in Nankai District lacked oxygen and asphalt, so it sent people to Beijing and local oxygen plants to make contact and overcome the difficulties. In addition, many units have adjusted the labor organization, ensuring the smooth progress of production while allowing workers to rest well. Some factories are intensifying the training of workers to quickly turn them into skilled workers in order to solve the problem of labor shortage.

    集中群众智慧　找出有效措施
    天津广大职工讨论生产计划
    许多工厂为第一季度生产和全年更大跃进做好准备
    本报讯　天津市许多工厂企业已经先后把今年第一季度生产计划交给职工群众广泛讨论，找到了各种有效措施，为实现今年的更大跃进作好准备。
    天津市广大职工为了把生产指标建立在既先进又稳妥可靠的基础上，提出了“十分指标，十二分措施”的战斗口号。接着河西、和平、河东等区二百多个工厂的职工讨论了第一季度和1月份的生产计划。各厂职工热情高涨，在大字报上和讨论会中，表示了完成计划的信心和决心，并针对着生产中一些薄弱环节，提出解决的办法。人民造纸一厂由于原料不足，第一季度全厂九台造纸机中有四台要停车，讨论中老工人们就提出利用库存的木浆试制罗纹纸等新品种的建议。棉纺三厂今年要大量生产精纱，工人们在讨论计划时，检查出去年生产精纱的主要缺点是车间卫生工作不够好，因此断头率高。有些工人就贴出大字报，表示一定要作到机台光、地面光、房顶光，搞好卫生，减少断头率。
    “大搞技术革命，提高工作效率”、“积极克服原材料和设备不足的困难”，是许多工厂在讨论或安排第一季度计划中提出的口号。全市的钢铁工人在第一季度要为国家生产十万吨钢。工人们提出要猛攻技术关键，克服高硫土铁带来的困难，让钢的质量和产量比翼双飞，并且炼出一些新品种的优质钢。化学工业系统为了解决某些原材料供应不足的困难，根据土洋并举的方针，第一季度将自己动手生产四十一种原材料，如采用土法生产纯碱，第一季度即可达一千六百多吨。同时开展综合利用，回收废料，弥补原材料的不足。
    为了适应今年生产跃进，许多工厂职工动手搞设备，武装自己。天津市锅炉厂今年第一季度除了要生产一百五十、二百吨兰开夏锅炉、化学工业设备、冶炼设备等以外，还根据国家建设的迫切需要，生产新产品——六十五吨和三十五吨的中压发电锅炉。这个厂第一季度生产总值相当于去年同期的288％。职工对完成计划充满信心，他们大搞技术革命解决生产关键问题。过去铆焊操作方面大部分使用人力，机械设备很少，沉重的铁板等在厂内调运时也都靠人力搬；在讨论今年第一季度计划中，锅炉车间和通用车间职工就动手设计和制造铆工简易机械设备和起重设备，机器车间也根据今年第一季度的生产任务，制造简易机床。
    不少工厂为了保证实现今春开门红，还开展了劳动竞赛，节省原材料，提高产品质量。仁立毛织厂的职工们在讨论了今年第一季度生产计划之后，迅速展开了以节约原材料、提高生产为中心的劳动竞赛。有的工厂职工在某些原料不足的情况下，仍然满怀信心，想办法节约原材料和采取代用品，并与兄弟厂和其它地区协作，互相支援。东亚毛麻纺织厂决定派人到广西等地寻找野生麻类纤维，以保证原材料的供应，并且主动承揽加工任务。南开区第五玻璃厂需要的氧气、沥青等原料缺乏，就派人到北京和当地的氧气厂等联系，克服了困难。此外，还有许多单位调整了劳动组织，既保证生产的顺利进行，同时使工人们休息得好。有些工厂为了解决人力不足的问题，正在加紧培训工人，让他们尽快地成为熟练工。
