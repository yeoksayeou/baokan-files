Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 24th: The Anren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province has adopted effective measures to vigorously run amateur schools throughout the county to consolidate and improve literacy achievements. At present, the majority of young and middle-aged people in the county are participating in amateur school studies. These schools generally conduct teaching based on the principle of combining politics, culture, and technology. Therefore, they have a certain effect on improving the political and ideological awareness and cultural and technical level of the masses, promoting production and various central tasks, and enlivening the cultural life of the masses. The masses love amateur schools very much, and they sing: "Amateur schools are really good, political awareness is greatly improved, culture and technology leap forward together, step by step on the stairs."

When the county basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people during last year's National Day, the county party committee studied and analyzed the following situations: First, literacy was carried out in a blitzkrieg manner, with a short time frame, and the characters recognized by the masses had not yet been digested and consolidated; second, some cadres and masses believed that the elimination of illiteracy had achieved results, and a sense of relaxation had arisen; third, production tasks were very tight, and labor mobilization was relatively large, making it difficult for the original literacy learning organization to maintain regular learning. In response to these situations, the county party committee put forward the requirements of continuing to exert efforts, overcoming slack thoughts, vigorously running amateur political, cultural, and technical schools, and consolidating literacy achievements. Subsequently, the county and commune party committees established organizations to lead amateur schools, appointed dedicated personnel to be responsible, and implemented unified leadership, unified use of teaching resources, and unified arrangement of production and study time. At the same time, in conjunction with socialist and communist education, extensive publicity was carried out among the masses to consolidate literacy achievements.

Anren County's amateur political, cultural, and technical schools adhere to the principle of being production-oriented and applying what is learned. They study politics according to the party's central work, learn culture in conjunction with politics and production, and learn technology according to the needs of production. In addition to literacy classes continuing to study literacy textbooks, other classes mainly study the textbooks compiled by the county that combine politics, technology, and culture. The county often compiles and distributes supplementary teaching materials in conjunction with the current central work and production tasks. For example, during the mass iron and steel production movement, supplementary teaching materials on indigenous methods of iron and steel smelting were compiled. Recently, when studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the county compiled popular learning materials suitable for the cultural level of amateur school students based on the spirit of the documents.

    继续鼓足干劲　巩固扫盲成果
    安仁县大办业余政治文化技术学校
    新华社长沙24日电　中共湖南省安仁县委采取有效措施，在全县大办业余学校，巩固和提高扫盲成果。目前全县大多数青壮年都参加了业余学校学习。这些学校一般都根据政治、文化、技术三结合的原则，进行教学，因此对提高群众的政治思想觉悟和文化技术水平，促进生产和各项中心工作，都有一定的作用，并且活跃了群众的文化生活。群众很喜爱业余学校，他们歌唱道：“业余学校真正好，政治觉悟大提高，文化技术齐跃进，脚踏楼梯步步高。”
    当去年国庆节全县基本上扫除了青壮年文盲的时候，县委就研究和分析了下列情况：一、扫盲是采取突击的方式进行的，时间短，群众认的字还来不及消化巩固；二、有些干部和群众，认为扫除文盲已取得成绩，产生了松劲思想；三、生产任务很紧，劳力调动较大，原来的扫盲学习组织很难坚持经常性的学习。针对这些情况，县委提出了继续鼓足干劲，克服松劲思想，大办业余政治、文化、技术学校，巩固扫盲成果的要求。接着县、社党委都成立了领导业余学校的机构，确定了专人负责，实行统一领导、统一使用教学力量、统一安排生产和学习时间。同时，结合社会主义和共产主义教育，广泛地向群众进行巩固扫盲成果的宣传。
    安仁县业余政治、文化、技术学校坚持面向生产、学以致用的原则，根据党的中心工作学政治，结合政治、生产学文化，根据生产的需要学技术。除扫盲班继续学习扫盲识字课本以外，其他班次主要是学习县里编写的政治技术文化三结合的教材。县里经常结合当前的中心工作和生产任务，编发补充教材。比如，在大搞钢铁生产运动中，就编了土法炼钢铁补充教材；最近学习党的八届六中全会文件时，县里又根据文件的精神编写了适合业余学校学员文化水平的通俗学习资料。
