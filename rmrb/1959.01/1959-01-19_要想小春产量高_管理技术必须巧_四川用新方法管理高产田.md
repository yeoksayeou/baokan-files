To Achieve High Yields in Spring Crops, Skillful Management Techniques are Essential
Sichuan Uses New Methods to Manage High-Yield Fields

    (Our report) To strive for large-scale high yields and bountiful harvests of summer-ripening crops, people's communes in various parts of Sichuan Province have created many new field management methods and new production technologies. In formulating this year's spring crop production plans, people's communes in various regions have demanded that all crops achieve high yields on a large scale, generally requiring yields to be doubled; high-yield experimental fields are no longer scattered plots but rather entire ditches, embankments, and fields. To adapt to this new situation, many people's communes have changed some of their old field management methods this year while focusing on field management. Among these new methods are various field management responsibility systems, the most common of which is the field signposting system. Some communes have also implemented filing and card registration systems, specifically recording yield increase targets, measures, field management work, and production conditions. Regular inspections are conducted to ensure that people are assigned to fields, fields are assigned to people, responsibilities are clear, methods are specific, and measures are guaranteed to be implemented.
    Various regions have also adopted collective research methods to jointly brainstorm ideas and find ways to manage spring crops effectively. In order to ensure that everyone masters the production techniques for increasing spring crop yields, counties in the Nanchong Special District have combined professional teams to run various Red and Expert technical schools, taking high-yield experimental fields as the center and adopting the "those who are capable become teachers" approach, teaching and learning from each other, and researching appropriate management measures based on crop growth conditions. Many counties such as Deyang and Langzhong, the management professional teams also adopted methods such as "field consultations", organizing production experts to lead professional teams to conduct block-by-block inspections of spring crops in the fields, and finding practical solutions to the problems discovered.
    The methods of leading field management are more in-depth and specific than before in various regions. In counties such as Pingchang, Shizhu, and Nanbu, cadres at the county, district, and commune levels have established leap-forward sheds, sentry sheds, guidance stations, and command fields in the fields at all levels, eating and living in the fields, going deep into one point, leading comprehensively, and solving problems in a timely manner.
    Based on crop growth conditions, various regions have also created many new techniques in field management. This year, areas such as Wenjiang, Mianyang, and Nanchong Special Districts have widely promoted wheat rolling and broad bean stem cutting methods. Experimental results have proven that the wheat rolling method can make wheat roots deeper, tillers more numerous, growth stronger, easier to retain water, and prevent lodging; cutting off the top of the broad bean main stem can make the beans plump and prevent the stems and leaves from growing excessively. Farmers in Jianyang and Dazu counties have created a fertilization tool that drills holes at the base of wheat roots and irrigates them with manure water, allowing the wheat roots to fully absorb and improve fertilizer efficiency.
    There have also been many reforms and creations in some field management farm tools. Members of the Yingshan County Field Management Red and Expert Technical School have collectively researched and produced various improved farm tools urgently needed for field management, such as seedling hoes, fertilizer applicators, and wooden sprayers. The use of these farm tools not only improves work efficiency, is suitable for large-scale high-yield fields, but also the quality is better than handmade.
    With the active efforts of the farmers, after the communes checked the fields, added measures, and increased efforts, a high tide of spring field management has been successively formed in various regions. At present, the province's 45 million mu of spring crops are growing well, and the crops are lush and vigorous.

    要想小春产量高　管理技术必须巧
    四川用新方法管理高产田
    本报讯　四川省各地人民公社为争取夏熟作物大面积高产多收，创造了许多新的田间管理方法和新的生产技术。各地人民公社在制订今年小春作物生产计划中，要求各项作物都能达到大面积高产，一般都要求成倍地增产；高额丰产试验田，也不再是零星的块块，而是一沟、一坝、一片。为了适应这种新情况，许多人民公社在抓紧田间管理的同时，今年都改变了一些旧的田间管理方法。这些新方法中，有各式各样的田间管理责任制，其中比较普遍的是田间插牌制，有的公社还实行了档案、卡片登记制。将增产指标、措施、田间管理工作和生产情况，具体登记，定期检查，作到人有田，田有人，责任明确，办法具体，措施实现有保证。
    各地还采取集体研究的方法，共同出主意想办法来管理好小春作物。南充专区各县为了作到人人掌握小春增产的生产技术，结合专业队开办了各种红专技术学校，以高产试验田为中心，采取“能者为师”的办法，互教互学，根据作物生长情况，研究出适当的管理措施。德阳、阆中等许多县，管理专业队还采取“田间会诊”等办法，组织生产能手带领专业队，到田地里对小春进行逐块检查，针对发现的问题，找出切实可行的解决办法。
    领导田间管理的方法，各地都比以前更加深入具体。平昌、石砫、南部等县，县、区、社各级干部，层层在田间建立跃进棚、放哨棚、指导站、指挥田等，吃住在田间，深入一点，领导全面，发现问题，及时解决。
    根据作物生长情况，各地在田间管理中还创造出许多新的技术。温江、绵阳、南充等专区各地，今年普遍推广小麦压苗法和蚕豆割断主茎法。试验结果证明，采用压苗法，可使小麦扎根深，分蘖多，生长壮，容易保水，又可防止倒伏；蚕豆割断主茎顶端，可使豆美籽粒饱满，防止茎叶徒长。简阳、大足等县农民创造了一种施肥工具，在小麦根部打穴，将粪水灌入，能使麦根充分吸收，提高肥效。
    一些田间管理农具也有不少的改革和创造。营山县田间管理红专技术学校成员，集体研究制成田间管理中急需的补苗锄、施肥器和木制喷雾器等改良农具多种。使用这些农具，不仅能提高工效，适宜大面积丰产田使用，而且质量也比手工做得好。
    在农民们的积极努力下，经过各公社查田块、添措施、加干劲，小春田间管理高潮在各地陆续形成。目前，全省四千五百万亩小春作物生长良好，庄稼青葱茁壮。
