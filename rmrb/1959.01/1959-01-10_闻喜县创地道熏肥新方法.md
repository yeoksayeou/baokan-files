Wenxi County Creates New Method for Local Smoked Fertilizer
Local Fertilizer Production Saves Transportation Costs; Utilizes Weeds to Eliminate Diseases
Combines Deep Plowing to Improve Soil; Method is Simple and Easy to Promote

(Our Dispatch) Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, has successfully tested a new method of accumulating farm fertilizer—the underground tunnel smoked fertilizer method. This new method has shown good results in testing and promotion, and is very popular among the masses. Recently, this experience was shared at the Shanxi Provincial Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, which attracted great attention from the representatives present. They believe this is a measure to accumulate fertilizer in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

This new method of accumulating farm fertilizer was successfully developed by Liu Qingquan, the Secretary of the CCP County Committee of Xia County (now merged into Wenxi County), and members of the Chengguan People's Commune in Xia County, based on the mass experience of rapid smoked fertilizer and pit-hole smoke fertilization commonly used in rural areas, after multiple tests.

The Chengguan People's Commune has achieved very good results with this method of smoked fertilizer. In a three-cent test plot, after thirty hours, the soil in the tunnel was smoked black, and the soil outside the tunnel was also smoked yellow, totaling an estimated 1,200 jin of fertilizer. Based on this standard, this method can generally fertilize 40,000 jin per mu of cultivated land.

The specific method of underground tunnel smoked fertilizer is as follows: First, use an iron shovel or ditching tool to dig a main ditch 1.8 zhang long, 1.2 chi wide, and 1 chi deep in the field (the length, width, and depth can be increased or decreased depending on the local conditions and equipment). Dig a pit in the middle of the main ditch to burn the fire and smoke. Then, dig twelve branch ditches connected to the main ditch on one side of the main ditch. Place relatively straight, smooth, and circular wooden rafters about four inches in diameter in the dug-out soil ditches. Use iron rakes and iron shovels to scrape the loose soil on both sides of the ditch around the wooden rafters, bury them about four inches, and slightly compact the loose soil by tamping. Then, slowly pull out the wooden rafters from one end, and tightly block the ends of each tunnel with firewood and grass, and cover them with soil, turning the open ditch into an underground culvert. The fire pit in the middle of the tunnel is tightly connected to two chimneys and the main tunnel opening. In order to ventilate and facilitate smoke flow, two chimneys can also be erected at one end of the branch tunnels. After these works are completed, fuel can be added to the fire pit and ignited (wild grass, straw, wood, and coal can be burned). In this way, the smoke from the fire pit is sent to the main tunnel through the fire pit chimney, and then distributed to the branch tunnels, circulating around, so that the smoke can be highly utilized to fertilize the soil in the tunnel.

After this experience was promoted, farmers in various regions have made many new improvements to make this method more perfect. For example, some farmers in some areas worry that tunnel smoking will affect soil moisture retention. When solving this problem, the farmers in Huzhang Township experimented with a ground-level tunnel construction method for smoked fertilizer. This method is to build a stove on an open space, with four to eight smoke outlets around it, level with the ground. One end of the wooden rafters is placed under the ground, and the rest is placed on the ground. The tunnel on the ground is made by burying the rafters with soil, and chimneys are set at the end of the tunnel, which effectively solves the contradiction between smoked fertilizer and moisture retention. In order to reduce procedures and improve work efficiency, the farmers of Dalu Township in this county have trial-produced a ditching plow for tunnel use. Four people can build tunnels for three mu of land in one day, which improves work efficiency by nearly seven times compared to digging tunnels by hand.

After preliminary summary, there are seven major benefits to using this new method to accumulate fertilizer: First, this source of fertilizer is inexhaustible, and the accumulation method is simple and easy to implement. According to a survey in Yuwang Township, each mu of land uses nine labor days and more than 1,000 jin of weeds and branches, and 84,000 jin of fertilizer can be smoked in three days. Second, this method can accumulate fertilizer on the spot, greatly saving transportation tools and transportation power. Third, fully utilizing weeds on the edges of fields not only saves money but also turns harm into benefit. Fourth, it can kill pests on the surface and underground parts of crops. Fifth, it can improve the soil. After smoking fertilizer, the soil temperature will increase, which can decompose phosphorus and potassium in the soil into nutrients that are easily absorbed by crops, and increase the fertility of the soil. Sixth, digging tunnels is a deep plowing. If a piece of land is smoked twice, the effect of comprehensive deep plowing can be achieved. Seventh, the smoke circulates in the tunnel for a long time, and nitrogen can be repeatedly absorbed by the soil. According to tests, the fertilizer smoked by this method contains 0.18% nitrogen. If the smoking time is increased, the quality can be further improved.

After the former Xia County area promoted this new fertilizer accumulation method, it showed a huge effect on production. For example, after Xia County promoted the underground tunnel smoked fertilizer method, it greatly eased the contradiction between the high demand for fertilizer in wheat fields and the lack of fertilizer and transportation power, and basically ensured the completion of the base fertilizer application plan for wheat fields. After further summarizing this experience, the CCP Wenxi County Committee decided to promote the experience of the former Xia County throughout the county. (Yang Yi)

    闻喜县创地道熏肥新方法
    就地造肥节省运输　利用杂草消灭病害
    结合深翻改良土壤　方法简单便于推广
    本报讯　山西省闻喜县试验成功一种积制农家肥料的新办法——地道熏肥法。这种新办法在试验和推广中效果很好，很受群众欢迎。最近山西省农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上交流了这一经验，引起到会代表们的极大重视，他们认为这是一项多快好省的积制肥料的措施。
    这个积制农家肥料的新办法，是夏县（现在已合并为闻喜县）中共县委书记刘清泉和夏县城关人民公社社员们在农村通常使用的快速熏肥和坑洞熏烟制肥等群众经验的基础上，经过多次试验获得成功。
    城关人民公社采取这种办法熏肥效果很好，试验的三厘地，经过三十个小时，地道里的土壤被熏成黑色，地道外的土壤也被熏黄，合算总计熏肥一千二百斤。以这个标准推算，采取这种办法每亩耕地一般可熏肥四万斤。
    地道熏肥法的具体作法是：先用铁锨或开沟工具在田间挖一道一丈八尺长、一尺二寸宽、一尺深的主沟（长、宽、深度可以因地、因设备而增大或减小），主沟中腰部挖一个准备烧火熏烟的地坑，然后在主沟一旁挖和主沟贯通的十二道支沟。把比较通直、光滑、直径四寸左右的圆形木椽，放在挖好的土沟里，用铁耙、铁锨等把沟道两旁的虚土刮到木椽周围，埋上四寸左右，稍加镇压拍打夯实虚土，然后徐徐把木椽从一头抽出，把各个地道的末端洞口用柴草堵严，用土盖上，使明沟变成了地下暗沟。地道中部的烧火坑作二个烟囱和主地道洞口紧密衔接。为了通风和畅通烟流，还可以在支地道的一端竖起两个烟囱。这些工作完成以后，就能在烧火坑添上燃料燃着（烧野草、秸秆、木柴和煤炭都可以）。这样烧火坑的烟通过烧火坑烟囱送到主地道，由主地道再分散到各支地道里，循环周转，就能高度利用烟火在地道内的土壤上熏肥。
    这项经验经过推广以后，各地农民又有许多新的改进，使这个办法更加完善。如有些地区农民顾虑地道熏烟影响土地保墒。在解决这个问题时，胡张乡农民们又试验出一种地皮筑道熏肥法。这种方法是在一块空地上筑一个烧火炉，周围作四至八个出烟筒，出烟筒和地面相平，将木椽一端放在地面下，其余放在地面上，用土埋椽制成地面上的暗道，在地道尾部设烟囱，这样有效地解决了熏肥和保墒的矛盾。这县的大吕乡农民为了减少工序、提高工作效率，试制了一部作地道使用的开沟犁，每四个人一天可筑三亩地的地道，比人挖地道提高工作效率近七倍。
    经过初步总结，采用这种新办法积制肥料有七大好处：一、这项肥源取之不尽，积制方法简便易行。据禹王乡调查，每亩地用工九个、杂草树枝一千多斤，三天就熏肥八万四千多斤。二、这种办法可以就地积制肥料，大大节省了运输工具和运输力。三、充分利用地头杂草，既节省资金，又可变害为利。四、可以杀除地面和地下部分农作物虫害。五、可以改良土壤。经过熏肥，地温就要增高，这样能使土壤里的磷钾素分解，变为容易为作物吸收的养料，提高土壤的肥度。六、挖地道就是一次深耕，如果在一块地进行两次熏肥，就可以兼得全面深翻效果。七、烟在地道循环时间长，氮素可以反复地被土壤吸收。据化验，用这种办法熏的肥含氮素有千分之一点八，如果熏烟时间增多，质量还能提高。
    原夏县地区推广了这一新积制肥料办法以后，在生产上显示出了巨大作用。如夏县经过推广地道熏肥法，大大地缓和了麦地需肥多，肥料、运输力不足的矛盾，基本上保证了麦田施底肥计划的完成。中共闻喜县委进一步总结了这一经验后，决定把原夏县的经验在全县范围内推广。　　　　　　　　（杨义）
