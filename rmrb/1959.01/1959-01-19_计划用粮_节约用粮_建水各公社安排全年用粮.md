    Planned Grain Consumption, Economical Grain Use
    JianShui Communes Arrange Annual Grain Usage
    (Our dispatch) Yunnan Province, JianShui County's People's Communes, combining the cleaning of granaries, have formulated annual grain usage plans based on the principles of eating enough, eating well, and saving.
    In 1958, JianShui County's grain production increased by more than double that of 1957. After the autumn harvest, the People's Communes implemented free meals. Under the guidance of the JianShui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, starting from November of last year, the Party committees of each commune, through organizing mass meetings and debates, conducted education on planned grain usage. At the same time, they mobilized the masses and commune/brigade cadres, along with grain department personnel, to jointly clean warehouses, verify production, and formulate annual grain usage plans.
    The county's rural population has an average of 600 jin of grain per person per year. Based on the local production of various grains and the premise of appropriately improving food nutrition, methods were adopted that combined coarse and fine grains and supplied a certain amount of vegetables. ChenGuan People's Commune also adopted the practice of planning annual grain usage according to different seasons and the heaviness of labor. From the plans formulated by the county's ten communes, the general grain usage did not exceed the 600 jin target.
    In order to ensure planned grain usage, many communes or production teams have generally established grain supply stations. Taking the dining hall as a unit, they collect rations from the supply station each month according to the actual number of diners. While planning grain usage, each commune also formulated plans and systems for saving grain. In addition to establishing a food committee in each public dining hall, they publish accounts to members every half month or month, and also promoted a system of inter-commune dining and receiving grain coupons when going out. Under the principles of planning and saving grain, each commune also sought methods to improve the diet of its members.

    计划用粮　节约用粮
    建水各公社安排全年用粮
    本报讯　云南省建水县各人民公社，结合清理粮仓按照吃饱、吃好、节省的原则，制订了全年用粮计划。
    1958年建水县的粮食产量比1957年增加了一倍多，秋收后各人民公社实行了吃饭不要钱。在中共建水县委会指导下，从去年11月份开始，各公社党委就通过组织群众座谈和辩论的方法，进行计划用粮的教育；同时发动群众和社、队干部和粮食部门人员共同清理仓库，核实产量，制订了全年用粮计划。
    全县农村人口平均每人每年有六百斤口粮。根据当地各种粮食的生产情况及适当改善食物营养的前提下，采取了粗细搭配和供应一定数量蔬菜的用粮办法。陈官人民公社还采取按照不同季节、活计轻重来计划全年用粮。从现在全县十个公社制订的计划来看，一般用粮都没有超过六百斤的指标。
    为了保证计划用粮，许多公社或生产队普遍建立了粮食供应站。以食堂为单位，每月根据实际吃饭人数向供应站领取口粮。在计划用粮的同时，各公社并制订节约用粮的计划和制度。各公共食堂除了设立伙食委员会外，每半个月或一个月向社员公布一次账目，还推行了公社之间往来吃饭和外出领粮票的制度。各公社在计划和节约用粮的原则下，还想方法改善社员伙食。
