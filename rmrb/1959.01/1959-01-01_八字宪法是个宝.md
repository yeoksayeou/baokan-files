    The Eight-Character Constitution is a Treasure
    Chen Yongkang, Captain of the First Brigade of the Dongfeng People's Commune, Songjiang County

    1958 ended amidst the victorious cheers of the Great Leap Forward; 1959 has arrived with the east wind. I extend my New Year's greetings to all farmer brothers and sisters across the country, and to all the people of the nation! And I wish the people of the whole country even greater victories in the new year!

    Recently, as a representative of Jiangsu Province, I attended the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Socialist Construction Units. Based on the spirit of the conference and the specific conditions of our commune, I deeply realized that while implementing the Party's policy of putting politics in command and following the mass line, earnestly implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, and management proposed by Chairman Mao is indeed a scientific path to increasing agricultural production in our country.

    I am a farmer. In the past, I was rewarded for high yields on small plots. At the beginning of 1958, the commune proposed targets and measures for large-scale yield increases. At that time, I still held a skeptical attitude. But last spring, seeing the series of production increase measures implemented by the Party committee by mobilizing the masses, especially the slogan "Ten-Point Targets, Twelve-Point Measures" put forward by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, I completely believed that this agricultural Great Leap Forward was truly an agricultural revolution with both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of seeking truth from facts. In 1958, our team achieved more than double the yield of single-season late rice compared to 1957, which was also the result of implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution." Paddy fields with 200 dan of standard fertilizer per mu yielded significantly more than those with 100 dan, with an increase of almost 1,000 to 2,000 catties of grain. Close planting also yielded more than sparse planting. The masses said joyfully, "We have never seen such thriving rice!"

    When implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution," we should achieve both a central focus and mutual integration and support. These eight characters are almost indispensable. Our team has done just that. The average yield of early rice in the team reached more than 1,600 catties per mu, and the average yield of late rice reached more than 1,300 catties.

    The new year has begun. I firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, farmers across the country will exert even greater efforts, take the "Eight-Character Constitution" as the key, and surely achieve even greater victories on the agricultural front, and the prospect of agricultural industrialization will surely be realized ahead of schedule.

    八字宪法是个宝
    松江县东风人民公社第一大队队长　陈永康
    1958年，在大跃进的胜利声中结束；1959年，又迎着东风来到了人间。谨向全国农民兄弟、全国人民祝贺新年！并祝全国人民在新的一年取得更大的胜利！
    最近期间，我随江苏省的代表，出席了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。根据会议的精神和我们社的具体情况，深深体会到在贯彻党的政治挂帅和群众路线的方针的同时，认真执行毛主席提出的水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管的“八字宪法”，确实是我国农业增产的科学途径。
    我是一个农民，过去曾经因为小面积的单位面积高产，获得奖励。1958年初，社里提出了大面积增产的指标和措施，当时，我还抱着将信将疑的态度。可是在去年春天，看到党委发动群众所实施的一系列增产措施，特别是后来中共江苏省委提出的“十分指标、十二分措施”的口号，我才完全相信这次农业大跃进才真是既有冲天干劲，又有实事求是精神的农业革命。1958年，我队单季晚稻取得比1957年增产一倍以上的成绩，也正是执行了“八字宪法”的结果。每亩施二百担标准肥的农田，比施一百担的，都增产得多，差不多增产一千到二千斤粮食。密植，也比稀植收得多。群众喜气洋洋地说：“从来没见过长得这样兴旺的稻子！”
    在执行“八字宪法”时，应该做到既有中心，又要相互结合，相辅而行。这八个字，几乎是缺一不可。我队正是做到了这一点，全队早稻的产量，平均每亩才达到了一千六百多斤，晚稻平均达到了一千三百多斤。
    新的一年开始了，我毫不动摇地相信，在党的正确领导下，全国农民鼓足更大的干劲，以“八字宪法”为纲，在农业战线上，一定会取得更大的胜利，农业工业化的前景，一定能够提早实现。
