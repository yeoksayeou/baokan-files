　　Promoting Positive Factors

　　The Jinbei Special District of Shanxi Province started with summing up achievements and commending advanced figures to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, which greatly encouraged the vast number of cadres and the masses. Everyone was in a cheerful mood and had even greater enthusiasm. The rectification work and winter production both showed a vigorous new look. This fact once again illustrates that paying attention to promoting positive factors in all kinds of work will continuously strive for new and greater victories on the basis of consolidating existing victories.

　　After the emergence of the people's communes, they demonstrated great superiority in just a few months. The great victories of last year's autumn harvest and autumn planting and the great leap forward in steelmaking, the great victories of current wheat field management, water conservancy construction, and the development of diversified economies, and the improvement of the living standards of the peasant masses are all clear proof of its superiority. The masses have already seen these. However, if these achievements and experiences are systematically summarized, the masses will feel the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the commune system more deeply and centrally, thereby loving the commune even more and making greater efforts to consolidate the people's commune. In the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and the communization movement, thousands upon thousands of advanced figures with a communist spirit emerged. Commending these figures also set advanced examples for the broad masses.

　　We are fighting to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. The tasks before us are more arduous, and we will encounter many difficulties on the road ahead. However, as long as we are good at relying on the masses and good at promoting all positive factors, we will have the great strength and courage to overcome all difficulties.

    发扬积极因素
    山西省晋北专区从总结成绩表扬先进人物入手，整顿巩固人民公社，使广大干部和群众受到很大的鼓舞，人人心情舒畅，干劲更高，整社工作和冬季生产都呈现生气勃勃的新气象。这个事实再一次说明，在各种工作中注意发扬积极因素，就会在巩固已有胜利的基础上不断争取新的更大的胜利。
    人民公社出现以后，在短短的几个月中就表现了巨大的优越性。去年的秋收秋种和大炼钢铁的伟大胜利，现在的麦田管理、水利建设、发展多种经济的伟大胜利，农民群众生活的改善等等，都是它的优越性的鲜明的证明。这些，群众是已经看到了。但是，如果把这些成就和经验加以系统的总结，就会使群众更深刻、更集中地感到大跃进的成就和公社制度的优越性，从而更加热爱公社，为巩固人民公社而作更大的努力。在农业大跃进和公社化运动中，涌现了上千上万的具有共产主义风格的先进人物，表扬这些人物，也就为广大群众树立了先进的榜样。
    我们正在为争取1959年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。摆在我们面前的任务是更加艰巨的，在前进的道路上还会遇到许多困难。但是，只要我们善于依靠群众，善于发扬一切积极因素，我们就有了战胜一切困难的巨大力量和勇气。
