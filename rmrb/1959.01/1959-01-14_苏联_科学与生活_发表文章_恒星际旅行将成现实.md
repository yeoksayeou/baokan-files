Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 13th: Just as people today are preparing to fly to the moon and other celestial bodies, interstellar travel will become a reality in the not-too-distant future. Outside the solar system, future cosmic travelers will be able to find plenty of "landing sites."

    This was stated by Valvarov, Chairman of the Cosmonautics Department of the Soviet Voluntary Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, in an article recently published in "Science and Life" magazine. The article discusses the prospects for future interstellar flight. As we know, the Earth, Mars, Venus, and other planets belong to the solar system. The sun is one of the billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. To engage in interstellar travel, one must not only overcome the Earth's gravity but also the sun's gravity, that is, reach the third cosmic velocity to fly out of the solar system.

    The article points out that today, not only interplanetary travel but also interstellar travel has become one of the central issues in the natural sciences and technology. Therefore, the question of the existence of planets around other stars that could be used as landing sites and scientific research bases for future cosmic travelers has aroused particular interest. In recent years, evidence has been obtained proving the existence of planet-like celestial bodies around some stars relatively close to us. According to Soviet academicians Oparin and Fesenkov, the probability of life existing around stars in the Milky Way is about one in one hundred thousand to one in one million. It is estimated that there are 150,000 planets with life in the Milky Way.

    The article continues, there are eleven stars not too far from the sun (within a radius of fifteen light-years). It takes light (the speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second) four years, two months, and twenty-eight days to travel from the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, to Earth. Therefore, to engage in such travel, it is necessary to build photon or meson rockets. These rockets are based on the phenomenon that certain antiparticles (electrons and positrons, protons and antiprotons, etc.) emit powerful radiation when they collide. After listing the current difficulties in manufacturing such rockets, the article says that all these many obstacles will surely be overcome. Modern science proves that not only interplanetary flight but also interstellar flight is, in principle, possible.

    The article also points out that flying to more distant stars is also possible. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the rate at which time elapses is not always the same but depends on the speed at which an object moves in space. The higher the speed of an object, the slower time elapses. On a rocket moving at a speed of 299,900 kilometers per second, the rate at which time elapses is one thirty-eighth of that on Earth. In other words, if you travel on such an interstellar spaceship for ten years and return, 380 years will have passed on Earth. In this way, human lifespan is sufficient to overcome distances of tens of light-years and reach stars that are quite far away.

### 苏联“科学与生活”发表文章  恒星际旅行将成现实

    苏联“科学与生活”发表文章
    恒星际旅行将成现实
    银河系恒星以亿万计　要到达须乘光子火箭
    恒星之间旅行才十载　地球上已过三百多年
    新华社莫斯科13日电　正如今天人们准备飞往月球和其它天体一样，在不太远的将来，恒星际航行也将成为现实。在太阳系之外，未来宇宙旅行家将可以找到足够多的“着陆场”。
    这是苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会宇宙飞行部主席瓦尔瓦罗夫最近在“科学与生活”杂志上发表的文章说的。文章谈到了未来恒星际飞行的前景。大家知道，地球、火星、金星等是属于太阳系的行星。太阳又是银河系里数以亿万计的恒星之一。要以从事恒星际旅行，不仅要克服地球引力，而且要克服太阳引力，即达到第三宇宙速度才能飞出太阳系。
    文章指出，今天，不仅行星际旅行，而且连恒星际旅行也已成为自然科学界和技术界中心问题之一了。因此，关于在其它恒星周围存在可能用作未来宇宙旅行家着陆场和科学考察基地的行星的问题，也就引起了特别的兴趣。近几年来已经获得了证据，证明在某些距我们较近的恒星周围存在着类似行星的天体。据苏联科学院士奥巴林和费辛科夫意见，银河系内恒星周围生命存在几率约为十万分之一到百万分之一。银河系中住有生命的行星估计有十五万个。
    文章接着说，离太阳不太远（在半径十五光年的范围内）的恒星有十一个。光线（光速是每秒钟三十万公里）从最近的恒星——半人马座比邻星到地球也要四年二月二十八天。因此要从事这种旅行必须要建造光子或介子火箭。这种火箭根据的原理是某些反粒子（电子和正电子、质子和反质子等）在冲撞时会发出强力辐射的现象。文章在列举了目前在制造这种火箭方面的困难后说，所有许多障碍都一定会克服的。现代科学证明，不仅行星际飞行，而且连恒星际飞行，原则上也是可能的。
    文章还指出，飞往较远的恒星也是可能的。根据爱因斯坦相对论，时间消逝的速度不是永远一样的，而要取决于物体在空间中的运动速度。物体运动速度愈高，时间消逝就愈缓。在以每秒二十九万九千九百公里速度运动的火箭上，时间消逝速度为地球上的三十八分之一。换句话说，乘坐这种恒星际飞行船旅行十年归来，地球上已过了三百八十年。这样，人的寿命也足以保证克服长达数十光年的距离，到达距离相当远的恒星上去。
