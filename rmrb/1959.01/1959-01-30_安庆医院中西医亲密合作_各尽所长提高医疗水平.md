Anqing Hospital: Close Cooperation Between Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Each Using Their Strengths to Improve Medical Standards

(Reported by this newspaper) Anqing Prefectural Hospital in Anhui Province has witnessed close collaboration between practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. Through mutual learning and active engagement in medical and academic research over the past four years, both TCM and Western medicine doctors have acquired preliminary skills in both medical systems, enriching their clinical experience and elevating their overall medical standards.

The Anqing Prefectural Hospital initiated the practice of Western medicine doctors learning TCM in January 1955, promoting cooperation between the two disciplines. The learning process integrated theory with practice. Western doctors studied the four classic texts of TCM, with TCM doctors providing instruction. In their work, they held joint clinics, shared responsibility for patient wards, promptly discussed patient conditions, jointly formulated treatment plans, and coordinated medication use. This mutual learning fostered a recognition of each other's strengths and merits, gradually bridging the gap between them. Currently, Western medicine doctors in this hospital can generally differentiate between "positive edema" (cardiac edema) and "wind edema" (renal edema). Many have learned acupuncture and can prescribe TCM formulas, achieving safe, effective, simple, and economical results in clinical practice. TCM doctors have also learned many of the strengths of Western medicine in diagnosis and treatment. For example, they use sphygmomanometers to measure blood pressure, stethoscopes to listen to the heart and lungs, can preliminarily identify the stages, grades, and locations of heart murmurs, and have mastered routine blood, urine, stool, and sputum tests, as well as liver and kidney function tests. Some TCM doctors have even learned to use microscopes to differentiate red and white blood cells and identify malaria parasites.

The Anqing Prefectural Hospital integrates TCM and Western medicine in medical treatment and combines it with scientific research. It has gradually developed complementary treatment plans in clinical treatment, discovered medical principles for some diseases previously considered incurable, and created new treatment methods through TCM-Western collaboration. For example, patients with advanced schistosomiasis often suffer from enlarged livers and kidneys, ascites, emaciation, and various other complications. The Western medicine treatment for this disease is antimony preparations, along with supportive therapies such as blood transfusions and paracentesis, but these treatments cannot cure schistosomiasis. The TCM treatment uses herbs such as Lobelia chinensis and Salvia miltiorrhiza. Lobelia chinensis can reduce ascites in advanced schistosomiasis, and Salvia miltiorrhiza can reduce the size of the enlarged liver and spleen, but they also cannot cure the disease. After TCM and Western medicine doctors collaborated, they jointly researched and adopted an integrated TCM-Western medicine approach. Based on the patient's condition and physique, they used TCM single or compound formulas, adjusted according to the symptoms, and Western medicine doctors provided examinations and supplementary nutrition and blood transfusions. Once the symptoms subsided and the patient's constitution improved, antimony injections were administered. During the antimony injection process, TCM herbs or acupuncture were used to reduce the toxic reactions of the antimony. During the research, TCM and Western medicine doctors offered their opinions based on their academic theories and experience without reservation. For example, when Western medicine doctors were studying the use of TCM herbs such as Salvia miltiorrhiza and Euphorbia pekinensis, TCM doctors actively introduced the properties, dosages, and methods of use of the herbs, helping Western medicine doctors prevent medical accidents. In this way, TCM and Western medicine doctors treated, researched, and improved together, creating a new method for treating advanced schistosomiasis.

Due to the integration of TCM and Western medicine, Western medicine doctors can prescribe TCM herbs and TCM doctors can order laboratory tests and write medical orders in their daily work. This has increased their medical knowledge and methods compared to the past, thereby improving medical standards. Currently, TCM and Western medicine doctors at Anqing Prefectural Hospital are continuing to collaborate on research into the treatment of advanced schistosomiasis, rheumatic arthritis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and bone tuberculosis.

    安庆医院中西医亲密合作
    各尽所长提高医疗水平
    本报讯　安徽安庆专署医院中西医亲密合作，互相学习，积极开展医疗和学术研究工作，四年来，中西医都初步学会两套医疗技能，丰富了临床经验，提高了医疗水平。
    安庆专署医院从1955年1月份开始组织西医学习中医，提倡中西医合作。在学习过程中，采用理论与实践相结合的办法。西医学习中医学的四大经典著作，由中医师负责讲解。在工作上，同时门诊，共管病房，及时研究病情，共同商订医疗方案，配合用药。由于在工作中相互学习，因此双方都感到各有所长、各有可取之处，逐渐消除了隔阂。现在，这个医院一般西医能够分辨出“正水”是心脏性水肿，“风水”是肾性水肿，许多人学会针灸、开中医处方，在临床上达到安全、有效、简便、经济的效果。中医也学会西医诊断与治疗的不少长处。如用血块表量血压，使用听诊器听心肺，能初步听出心脏杂音的分期、分级和位置的关系，掌握血、尿、粪、痰检验常规、肝肾功能试验等知识，有的中医还学会使用显微镜分辨红白血球，找到疟原虫。
    安庆专署医院中西医合作医疗，并和科学研究相结合，在临床治疗上逐步得出相辅相成的医疗方案，找到一些过去认为不治之症的医疗规律，创造了中西医合作的新疗法。如晚期血吸虫病的患者，肝肾肿大，腹大如鼓，骨瘦如柴，还有其他一些并发症。西医治这种病的药是锑剂，另外还做一些补助疗法，如输血、放腹水等，但不能根治血吸虫病。中医治疗这种病，是用半边莲和丹参等药。半边莲能消退晚期血吸虫病的腹水症，丹参能减缩肝脾肿大，但是也不能根治这种疾病。这个医院中西医合作后，共同研究，采用中西药综合疗法。根据晚期血吸虫病病人的病情和体质，使用中药的单方或复方，随症加减，灵活运用，西医配合检查，并补充营养、输血等，待症状消失，体质好转，再注射锑剂；在注射锑剂过程中，再配合中药或针灸，以减少锑剂的毒性反应。在研究中，中西医彼此根据学术理论和经验，毫不保留地提出意见。如西医研究使用丹参、大戟等中药时，中医主动介绍药性、用量用法等，帮助西医防止发生医疗事故。就这样，中西医边治疗，边研究，边提高，创造了治疗晚期血吸虫病的新疗法。
    由于中西医结合，在日常工作中，西医可开中药，中医可开化验单及医嘱，医疗知识和医疗方法比过去增多，因而提高了医疗水平。现在安庆专署医院中西医正继续合作研究治疗晚期血吸虫病、风湿性关节痛、肺结核、骨结核等。
