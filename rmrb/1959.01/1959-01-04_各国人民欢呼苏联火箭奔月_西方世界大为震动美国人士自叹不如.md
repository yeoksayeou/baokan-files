Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: This morning, Moscow Radio broadcast talks by Soviet scholars discussing the enormous significance of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a cosmic rocket.

Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Mikhailov, said that the launch of the cosmic rocket is not only a brilliant achievement of Soviet scholars, but also a new milestone in the Soviet Union's conquest of the universe. We can believe that the time when people fly to another planet is not far away.

Soviet scholar Kozyrev said that an event of great significance had occurred in human history—the Soviet cosmic rocket flying to the moon, which is the true beginning of mankind's conquest of the universe. He also said that Soviet scientists had successfully solved the problem of the second cosmic velocity—11.2 kilometers per second. From now on, the study of the universe will serve the interests of mankind.

Soviet physicist Kroshkin said that although the rocket is still flying, we can now say: "The Soviet cosmic rocket has surpassed the several cosmic rockets launched by the United States last year. In terms of altitude, the Soviet rocket has exceeded any of the American ones. This once again proves the advancement of Soviet technology."

He said that the launch of this cosmic rocket is the result of the hard work of Soviet scientists and technicians. It is a gift from Soviet scholars to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: Muscovites today listened with great excitement to the news about the Soviet Union's launch of a giant cosmic rocket.

In the early morning, the newspaper stands on every street were crowded with people. People on trams and subways also carefully read the news. In the workshops of various factories, workers, inspired by this major victory of the Soviet Union, were in a particularly high mood for production today.

Today, almost every Muscovite family turned on the radio to listen to the news about the operation of this giant cosmic rocket.

The Academy of Sciences, newspapers, and radio stations have been constantly receiving a large number of telegrams and telephone calls congratulating Soviet scholars.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 3rd: All Czechoslovak newspapers today published the major news of the Soviet Union's launch of a giant cosmic rocket to the moon on the front page with large headlines, hailing the great victory of Soviet science.

Czechoslovak Radio broadcast this major news in its midnight news and this morning. Prague's working people concentrated on reading the news on their way to work this morning, and expressed their joy and excitement at this great achievement of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 3rd: Newspapers in the Romanian capital today reported the news of the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket on the most prominent position on the front page. "Scinteia" and "Romania Libera" also published commentaries. Professor Calin Popovici, head of the Bucharest Observatory, wrote in "Scinteia" that the great significance of this Soviet launch of a cosmic rocket becomes even clearer when noting the failure of the United States to launch rockets. This victory shows how far the Soviet Union has gone in using rockets for peaceful purposes and making science benefit mankind. Calin Popovici finally congratulated Soviet scientists.

Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: TASS Cairo dispatch: On January 3rd, Cairo newspapers published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket to the moon on the front page with large headlines. "Al-Shaab" wrote in a banner headline: "Russia Launches Rocket to the Moon"; "Al-Gomhuria" wrote: "Russian Rocket is Flying to the Moon, Expected to Arrive at its Destination at 7:00 Tomorrow"; "Al-Ahram" wrote: "Rocket is Sending Radio Signals to the Ground".

Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd: The news of the Soviet Union's launch of a lunar rocket has once again shocked the Western world. Many people in Washington and London admit that this Soviet initiative once again proves that the Soviet Union has far outstripped the United States in the race to conquer outer space.

American outer space scientists expressed surprise at the huge weight of the last stage of the Soviet lunar rocket. Dr. Henry Richter Jr., head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, said, "This is really a tremendous big guy." He said that although the American "Atlas satellite is indeed large, it can actually only be compared to the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite."

Associated Press reporter Alton Blakeslee said that the Soviet Union has the rocket thrust to send fairly heavy, well-equipped measuring devices to the moon. The booster rockets that launch Soviet artificial satellites are generally believed to have a thrust of 500,000 to 600,000 pounds, which is much greater than the thrust of the American Atlas rocket.

Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration pretended to be calm and refused to comment on the Soviet launch of a lunar rocket. However, some U.S. government officials pointed out that so far, the U.S. lunar rockets have not reached their targets.

Congressmen were also caught off guard by the launch of the Soviet lunar rocket. Almost at the same time as the Soviet Union announced the launch of a lunar rocket, the House Space Committee passed a proposal requiring the Air Force to step up its work to "reach the moon." Senate Democratic Leader Johnson said that for some time, he had felt that the United States was not "going far enough, fast enough" in space.

Professor Massey, a Fellow of the Royal Society and Chairman of the British International Geophysical Year Artificial Satellite Sub-Committee, said that the Soviet Union's launch to the moon "is indeed a very huge project." He said, "The rocket can carry much more equipment than the rockets that the United States has launched to the moon."

An AFP dispatch from Paris said that the Soviet Union's launch of a lunar rocket today marks a new step towards conquering outer space.

West Berlin newspapers today published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket to the moon on the front page. The newspapers emphasized that the last stage of the rocket reached the necessary cosmic speed for interstellar flight: 11.2 kilometers per second. "Die Tageszeitung" pointed out that until now, American attempts to launch rockets to the moon have all failed.

    各国人民欢呼苏联火箭奔月
    西方世界大为震动美国人士自叹不如
    新华社莫斯科3日电　今天早晨莫斯科电台广播了苏联学者论述苏联成功发射宇宙火箭的巨大意义的谈话。
    苏联科学院通讯院士米哈伊洛夫说，宇宙火箭的发射不但是苏联学者的光辉成就，而且是苏联学者征服宇宙的一座新的里程碑。我们可以相信，人们飞上另外一个星球的时间已经不远了。
    苏联学者科齐列夫说，在人类历史上发生了一件意义重大的事件——苏联宇宙火箭飞向月球，这是人类征服宇宙的真正开端。他又说，苏联科学家顺利地解决了第二宇宙速度——每秒一一点二公里的问题。从现在开始，对宇宙的研究将为人类利益服务。
    苏联物理学家克罗什金说，虽然现在火箭还正在飞行，但是我们现在已经可以说：“苏联的宇宙火箭已经胜过了去年美国发射的几个宇宙火箭。就高度来说，苏联的火箭已经超过了美国的任何一个。这再一次证明了苏联技术的先进。”
    他说，这个宇宙火箭的发射是苏联科学家、技术家辛勤劳动的结晶。它是苏联学者献给苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的礼物。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　莫斯科人今天怀着无比兴奋的心情收听关于苏联发射巨型宇宙火箭的消息。
    清晨，各个街头卖报处都站满了人群。电车上和地下铁道上的人们也都仔细地阅读这个消息。在各工厂的车间里，为苏联的这一重大胜利所鼓舞的工人们，今天的生产情绪特别高涨。
    今天几乎每个莫斯科人的家庭都打开了收音机，收听有关这个巨型宇宙火箭的运行消息。
    科学院、报社和电台都不断收到大批向苏联学者们祝贺的电报和电话。
    新华社布拉格3日电　捷克斯洛伐克所有的报纸今天都在第一版用大字标题登载了苏联向月球发射巨型宇宙火箭这一重大新闻，欢呼苏联科学的巨大胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克电台在它的午夜新闻里以及在今天清晨都广播了这个重大消息。布拉格劳动人民今天早晨在去工作的途中都聚精会神地阅读这个消息，并且对苏联的这个巨大成就表示欢欣鼓舞。
    新华社布加勒斯特3日电　罗马尼亚首都各报今天都在头版最显著地位报道了苏联发射宇宙火箭的消息。“火花报”和“自由罗马尼亚报”还发表了评论文章。布加勒斯特天文台领导人卡林·波波维奇教授在“火花报”上写道，只要注意到美国发射火箭的失败，苏联这次发射宇宙火箭的巨大意义就更加清楚了。这一胜利说明，苏联在把火箭用于和平目的和使科学造福人类方面走了多远。卡林·波波维奇最后向苏联的科学家们祝贺。
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社开罗讯：3日开罗各报在第一版用大标题刊载了苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭的消息。“人民报”用通栏大标题写道：“俄国向月球发射火箭”；“共和国报”写道：“俄国的火箭正在飞向月球，预计明天七时可到达目的地”；“金字塔报”写道：“火箭正在向地面发出无线电信号”。
    新华社3日讯　苏联发射月球火箭的消息又一次震动了西方世界。华盛顿和伦敦许多人士承认，苏联这个创举再一次证明，在征服宇宙空间的竞赛方面，苏联已远远把美国抛在后面。
    美国宇宙空间科学家对苏联月球火箭最后一级的巨大重量表示惊异。加利福尼亚理工学院喷气推进实验室领导人小亨利·里克特博士说：“这真是一个了不得的大家伙。”他说，美国的“阿特拉斯卫星固然很大，实际上也只能同苏联第一个人造卫星相比。”
    美联社记者奥耳顿·布莱克斯利说，苏联拥有可以往月球发送相当重的装备完善的测视体的火箭推力。放射苏联人造卫星的推动火箭一般被认为具有五十万磅到六十万磅的推力，这比美国的阿特拉斯火箭的推力都要大得多。
    美国国防部和全国星际和空间航行局的发言人故作镇静，拒绝对苏联发射月球火箭发表评论。但是，一些美国政府官员指出，迄今为止，美国发射的月球火箭还没有达到他们的目标。
    国会人士也被苏联月球火箭的发射弄得手忙脚乱。差不多在苏联宣布发射月球火箭的同时，众议院空间委员会通过了一项提案，要求空军加紧进行“到达月球”的工作。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊说，若干时期来，他一直觉得美国在空间方面“进行得不够远，不够快”。
    英国皇家学会会员、英国国际地球物理年人造卫星小组委员会主席马西教授说，苏联向月球的发射
  “实在是一项非常巨大的计划”。他说，“火箭能装载的装备比美国发向月球的火箭的装载的装备要多得多”。
    法新社从巴黎发出的一条消息说，苏联今天发射月球火箭标志着向征服宇宙空间迈进了新的一步。
    西柏林出版的报纸今天在头版上刊登苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭的消息。各报强调指出，火箭最后一级达到星际飞行的必要宇宙速度：每秒十一点二公里。“日报”指出，直到现在为止美国试图向月球发射的火箭都以失败告终。
