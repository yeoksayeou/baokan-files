    Closely Integrate with the Needs of Spring Plowing

    Industry run by the communes must first serve agricultural production. In the current situation, it must first serve spring plowing and provide or repair the means of production urgently needed for commune production.

    In preparation for spring plowing, the Lidu Commune established more than sixty factories, producing many farm tools, local fertilizers, raincoats, bamboo hats, and so on. It is expected that the products of these factories will fully meet the commune's needs for spring plowing before it begins. This vividly illustrates the superiority of communes running industry. With industry, the commune has a favorable condition for spring plowing this year. However, this condition must be used wisely. The Lidu Commune first assessed the needs of spring plowing, then planned and formulated a plan, allocated resources, and established factories to manufacture goods, closely integrating commune industry with the current needs of agricultural production. This experience is worth noting.

    密切结合春耕需要
    公社办的工业，首先要为农业生产服务。就当前情况说，首先就要为春耕生产服务，给公社生产或修整当前急需的生产资料。
    李渡公社为准备春耕生产，办起了六十多个工厂，生产了许多农具、土化肥、蓑衣、斗笠等。预计到春耕开始前，这些工厂的产品能完全满足公社春耕的需要。这就生动地说明了公社办工业的优越性。公社有了工业，是今年进行春耕的一个有利条件。但是，这个条件也要善于运用。李渡公社事先对春耕需要摸了底，然后有计划地制定方案，调度力量，设厂制造，使公社工业同当前农业生产的需要密切结合起来，这个经验是值得注意的。
