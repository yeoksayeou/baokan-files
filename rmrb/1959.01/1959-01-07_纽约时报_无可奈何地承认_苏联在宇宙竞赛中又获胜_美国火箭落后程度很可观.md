    "New York Times" Reluctantly Admits the Soviet Union Has Once Again Won the Space Race
    US Rockets Are Considerably Behind

    Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: New York News: The "New York Times" stated in an editorial on the 6th commenting on the Soviet Union's successful launch of a space rocket, that the United States is considerably behind the Soviet Union in rocket technology.

    The editorial considered this to be an "unpleasant fact."

    The editorial said that this helps to eliminate the illusion among Americans that the successful launch of the (American) Atlas satellite "has already put us (the United States) on par with, or even surpassed, our Soviet competitors in some areas."

    The editorial complained that the U.S. government has failed to keep up with the Soviet Union's achievements in this area and complained that the United States does not have a grand plan to conquer space like the Soviet Union.

    The editorial concluded by saying, "The lunar rocket more forcefully than ever reminds people of the fundamental lesson of the Soviet artificial satellites. Soviet scientists and engineers are our (the United States') first-class rivals."

    "New York Times" Washington correspondent Finney published an article on the 5th with the title: "Russia Re-Leads in Space Race; Soviet Victory Deals Blow to Hard-Won Confidence Here After US Failure." He wrote: "This weekend, just as the United States thought they were about to catch up with the Soviet Union, they fell behind again in the space race."

    “纽约时报”无可奈何地承认
    苏联在宇宙竞赛中又获胜
    美国火箭落后程度很可观
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：6日的“纽约时报”在一篇评论苏联成功地发射宇宙火箭的社论中说，美国在火箭方面落后于苏联的程度是很可观的。
    社论认为，这是一个“不愉快的事实”。
    社论说，这有助于消除美国人的错觉，似乎（美国的）阿特拉斯卫星发射成功“就已经使我们（美国）在某方面同苏联竞争者并驾齐驱了，或者是超过了他们”。
    社论埋怨美国政府没有能够赶上苏联在这方面的成就，并且埋怨美国不像苏联有征服空间的远大的计划。
    社论最后说，“月球火箭比以前任何时候更有力地向人们重新提起苏联人造卫星的根本教训。苏联的科学家和工程师是我们（美国）的第一流的劲敌”。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者芬尼在5日以这样的题目发表文章：“俄国在宇宙竞赛中再次领先，美国失败后，苏联的胜利使这里勉强取得的信心遭到了打击”。他写道：“本周末，正当美国认为他们要赶上苏联的时候，他们在宇宙空间的竞赛中又落后了。”
