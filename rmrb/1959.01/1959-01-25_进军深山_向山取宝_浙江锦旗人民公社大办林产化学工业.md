Advancing into the Deep Mountains to Extract Treasures
    The Jinqi People's Commune in Zhejiang Province Vigorously Develops a Forest Chemical Industry

    "Forest chemical production is greatly enlightened; every plant and tree has a use; miscellaneous trees and wild grasses become treasures; our lives are greatly improved." This is a song sung by the members of the Jinqi People's Commune in Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, praising the vigorous development of forest chemical industry production. Indeed, since the Jinqi People's Commune began vigorously developing the forest chemical industry, in less than three months, it has not only produced a large number of forest chemical products to supply national construction, but also greatly increased the commune's income. As a result, every member has seen the bright prospects of the mountainous area more clearly and has fallen in love with this rich and beautiful mountainous area.

    The Jinqi People's Commune began vigorously developing the forest chemical industry in October last year. At that time, the Longquan County Party Committee, based on the principle of combining industry and agriculture and the characteristics of the county, put forward the slogan "March into the deep mountains, extract treasures from the mountains, and vigorously develop the forest chemical industry" as a political and economic task for the people of the county. All members of the Jinqi People's Commune were the first to respond to this call, working hard for seven days to build 207 forest chemical factories, including charcoal kiln comprehensive utilization plants, crude tannin extract plants, alcohol plants, rayon plants, and aromatic oil plants. After these factories were built, shrubs, wild grasses, branches, bark, and leaves in front of and behind houses, beside villages and roads, and on mountains became valuable raw materials for the forest chemical factories. In just over two months by the end of last year, more than 10,000 catties of wood tar, more than 1,000 catties of methanol, and nearly 100,000 catties of sodium acetate were produced, with a total output value of more than one million yuan.

    Jinqi Commune is a mountainous area with many mountains, little arable land, and abundant forest resources. The commune has more than 330,000 mu of mountainous land, accounting for 95% of the total land area, a forest stock volume of 1.89 million cubic meters, more than 5.85 million mao bamboo plants, 102 species of wild plants in seven categories, and underground resources such as coal and iron ore. Therefore, the commune has broad prospects for development in industrial and agricultural production, especially in the forest chemical industry. However, in the past, like other mountainous areas, the rich and valuable resources were not rationally utilized. Piles of branches, shrubs, and wild grasses were burned as firewood or left on the mountains to rot. After the Party committee's leadership, attention, and care, and with the active development of forest chemical industry production, these resources have been rationally utilized, and every plant and tree on the mountain has become a treasure. In the past, no one dared to think that branches and wild grasses could be used to weave cloth and sew clothes. When the commune's three rayon plants produced the first batch of pure white rayon, the members excitedly said, "Even without cotton, we don't have to worry about clothes anymore." The members' confidence and determination in vigorously developing the forest chemical industry became even more firm.

    However, at the beginning of the Jinqi Commune's forest chemical industry development, some people did not fully understand the significance of developing forest chemicals. The commune Party committee and the commune head convened a commune committee meeting to implement the county Party committee's instructions. The members of the commune committee unified their understanding, and at the same time, they calculated four accounts among the masses: the account of the great potential of the mountainous area, the account of the benefits of vigorously developing the forest chemical industry for consolidating the commune, the account of the role of forest chemical products in supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and the account of the benefits of developing the forest chemical industry for improving people's lives. Through the "four calculations," the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly boosted, and a system of special personnel responsible for building factories and professional labor organizations was quickly established in the commune and teams.

    The commune Party committee leaders personally took charge. To solve the labor problem in the vigorous development of the forest chemical industry, on the one hand, unified planning and reasonable arrangements were made; on the other hand, transportation construction was vigorously carried out, with the construction of chutes and cableways to facilitate the transportation of raw materials and save labor. The commune has more than 5,660 laborers. In addition to steelmaking and agricultural production, 1,700 laborers were assigned to forest chemical production. At the same time, carpenters, masons, and blacksmiths in various industries of the commune were unified and organized for division of labor and cooperation. Due to the rational arrangement of labor and the organized division of labor, the strength of each person was fully utilized, which not only led to the construction of many forest chemical factories, but also ensured the simultaneous great leap forward in steelmaking and agricultural production.

    What to do if you don't understand technology? The commune Party committee first seized the opportunity of a comprehensive forest chemical plant run by the Longquan Forest Farm in the commune, and organized more than 80 grassroots cadres to visit and study on site. In a few days, they gradually learned the production operation and factory construction and equipment installation technology of 16 products, including aromatic oil, comprehensive utilization of charcoal, rayon, tannin extract, and dry distillation of pine resin. They then went to various teams to teach, so that the technology of forest chemical production was quickly mastered by the masses. The flowers of "small indigenous groups" of forest chemical production bloomed all over the Jinqi People's Commune.

    In order to solve the funding problem, the commune Party committee adhered to the principle of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily." The members creatively used locally produced mao bamboo instead of condensing coils, and simply solved the equipment problem. In this way, although not much money was spent, various forest chemical factories were set up.

### 进军深山　向山取宝  浙江锦旗人民公社大办林产化学工业

    进军深山　向山取宝
    浙江锦旗人民公社大办林产化学工业
    “林化生产大开窍，一草一木有用了；杂木野草成宝贝，我们生活大提高。”这是浙江省龙泉县锦旗人民公社的社员们，对大搞林产化学工业生产的歌颂。的确，锦旗人民公社自大办林产化学工业以来，还不到三个月的时间，不仅生产出了大批的林产化学产品供应国家建设，而且大大增加了公社的收入。因此，使每个社员都更加清楚地看到了山区美好的前景，更加爱上了这个富饶秀丽的山区。
    锦旗人民公社大办林产化学工业是去年10月开始的。当时，中共龙泉县委根据工农业并举的方针和本县特点，提出了“进军深山，向山取宝，大搞林产化学工业”的口号，作为全县人民的政治和经济任务。锦旗人民公社的全体社员，首先响应了这一号召，大干七天，建成了二百零七座林产化学工厂，其中有木炭窑综合利用厂、土法栲胶厂、酒精厂、人造纤维厂、芳香油厂。这些厂建成后，房前屋后、村旁道旁、山上山下的灌木、野草、树枝、树皮、树叶都成了林产化学工厂的宝贵原料，到去年年底仅两个多月的时间，就生产出了上万斤的木焦油、上千斤的甲醇和近十万斤的醋酸钠，总产值达一百多万元。
    锦旗社是一个山多耕地少森林资源丰富的山区，全社山地面积三十三万多亩，占土地总面积的95％，森林蓄积量一百八十九万立方公尺，有毛竹五百八十五万多株，野生植物七类一百零二种，地下资源还有煤铁矿等。因此，这个社在工农业生产上，特别是林产化学工业生产方面，具有广阔的发展前途。但是，过去这里也和其他山区一样，丰富宝贵的资源没有被合理利用，堆积如山的树枝、灌木、野草都当作烧柴烧掉或丢在山上任其腐烂。在党委的领导重视关怀下，积极发展林产化学工业生产之后，这些资源才得到了合理利用，山上的一草一木都变成了宝贝。过去从来没有人敢想过树枝、野草也能织布缝衣，当社里的三座人造纤维厂生产出第一批洁白的人造丝时，社员们都兴奋地说：“就是没有棉花也再不愁穿衣了”。社员们大办林产化学工业的信心和决心更坚定了。
    但是，锦旗社在办林产化学工业的当初，有些人对办林产化工的意义还不十分了解，社党委和社长针对这个情况召开了公社委员会会议，贯彻了县委的指示，社委委员统一了认识，同时在群众中算四笔账，即算山区潜力大的账，算大办林产化学工业对巩固公社的好处的账，算林产化学产品对支援工、农业大跃进的作用的账，算林化工业发展后对改善人民生活的好处的账。通过“四算”，大大鼓舞了群众的积极性，很快就在社、队建立了专人负责制和建厂的专业劳动组织。
    社党委领导亲自挂帅，为解决大办林化工业的劳力问题，一方面进行了统一规划，合理安排；另方面又大力进行交通建设，修筑滑道、索道，便利原料运输，节省劳力。全社共有五千六百六十多个劳动力，除搞炼钢、农业生产外，抽出一千七百个劳动力投入林产化工生产，同时把公社各行业的木工、泥水工及铁匠都统一组织起来，分工合作。由于合理安排了劳动力，有组织有分工，充分发挥每个人的力量，不仅大办了很多林产化学工厂，还保证了炼钢、农业生产齐跃进。
    不懂技术怎么办？社党委首先抓住龙泉林场在社里办的一个综合性林化厂，组织了八十多名基层干部到现场参观学习，几天的时间就分别逐步学会了芳香油、木炭综合利用、人造棉、栲胶、松明子干馏等十六种产品的生产操作和建厂、设备装置等技术。他们又分别到各队传授，使林产化学生产的技术很快为广大群众所掌握，“小土群”林化生产的鲜花开遍了锦旗人民公社的各个角落。
    为了解决资金问题，社党委坚持了“勤俭办企业”的原则，社员们创造性地用就地出产的毛竹代替冷凝盘管，因陋就简地解决了设备的问题，这样花钱虽不多，同样办起了各种林产化学工厂。
