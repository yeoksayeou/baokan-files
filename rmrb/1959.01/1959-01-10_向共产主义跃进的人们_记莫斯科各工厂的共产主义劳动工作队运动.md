    People Leaping Forward to Communism
    ——A Record of the Communist Labor Brigade Movement in Moscow Factories
    By Our Correspondent Chen Quanbi
    For over a month, since the nationwide discussion of the draft report on Khrushchev's Seven-Year Plan, Moscow has entered a tense yet enthusiastic atmosphere. Opening the daily newspapers, the striking and inspiring headlines such as "The Light of Communism Illuminates Our Motherland" and "Towards the Communist Tomorrow" invigorate people's spirits. Some say that Moscow is experiencing spring in winter, nurturing the youthful vitality of communist construction and cultivating people's will to move forward. In factories, the movement to establish Communist Labor Brigades, launched to welcome the great Seven-Year Plan, is vigorously unfolding. On every front of communist construction, people are taking big strides and bravely leaping forward.
    A week ago, I visited the Moscow Three Mountains Textile Factory, an old factory with a history of 160 years. It is said that Lenin visited here ten times. In the coming seven years, the Three Mountains Textile Factory will increase its productivity by an average of 50% in spinning, weaving, and processing workshops. Its output will increase from the current 700,000 meters per day and night to 900,000 meters, and the variety will increase from the current 800 kinds to nearly 3,000 kinds. Their slogan is: To make Muscovites dress more beautifully and more attractively. This factory has widely launched the Communist Labor Brigade movement, and 22 work teams have decided to strive to become Communist Labor Brigades. The first shot of this movement was fired by the Smirnova work team in the spinning workshop. The Smirnova work team has always been at the forefront of any movement in this factory. Smirnova herself, though not old, is conscientious, responsible, and good at uniting people. The conditions put forward by the Smirnova work team for establishing a Communist Labor Brigade are as follows: To complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years, to increase labor productivity by 15%, to completely eliminate waste and defective products, to save 72,000 rubles for the factory in seven years, to learn three or four skills within two or three years, and to improve their technical level to the first grade.
    The Communist Labor Brigade movement in the weaving workshop is also in full swing. At the entrance of the workshop, there are two bright red banners, one saying "Salute to the Glorious Communist Labor Brigade" and the other saying "Today's work should be better than yesterday's, and tomorrow's work should be better than today's." Since the launch of the Communist Labor Brigade movement in this workshop, significant changes have taken place in all aspects. A young female worker in the workshop, Gushiyeva, put it well. She said that the Communist Labor Brigade movement is like a mirror, clearly reflecting everyone's work attitude and their relationship with communist construction. Gushiyeva is a member of the Communist Youth League and was just approved as a candidate member of the CPSU two weeks ago. She also told us about the recent changes in their work team. She said that since the launch of the Communist Labor Brigade movement, the biggest change is of course in production. In the past 20 days or so, the production of their team has increased by 33% compared to before. They now manage 12 machines per person, expanded from 8 machines. The quality of production has also improved compared to before. The relationship between workers has also improved. Now, whether it is cotton yarn breakage, machine failure, or temporary absence, everyone rushes to help. Mutual assistance in life goes without saying. The enthusiasm for learning is also high. In the past, when learning only one skill, everyone complained that there was not enough time. Now, in addition to learning skills, they also learn the history of the CPSU. Strictly observing labor discipline and boldly launching criticism and self-criticism are also among the most significant changes recently.
    In this month, I visited the Moscow Rubber Factory twice, but each time it gave me a fresh feeling. If the factory was still in the stage of heatedly discussing the draft report on the Seven-Year Plan twenty days ago, then now the workers have set off a wave of the Communist Labor Brigade movement. Since the launch of the Communist Labor Brigade movement in this factory, there have also been great changes. The secretary of the factory's Party committee, Alov, told me that the first change is in the improvement of the workers' ideological awareness. The workers now think this way: not only must they produce well and study well, but they must also have good ideas; they must strictly demand themselves according to the conditions for the all-round development of communism.
    I visited the factory's sixth workshop, which is a workshop specializing in manufacturing various sizes of rubber tubes. This workshop has four work teams. Although the number of people is not large, their enthusiasm for striving to establish a Communist Labor Brigade is no less than that of other workshops. The director of the workshop, Alexander, introduced us to the work team leader, Delyusin, who was a captain in the army five years ago. As soon as he saw us, he said with a smile that his work team, including himself, has only five people, but now the number of people is a secondary issue. What plays a decisive role is their attitude towards communist construction and their own achievements in work. On the production statistics table of the Delyusin work team for the past ten days, a red line pointing straight upwards shows that the Delyusin work team has completed 200% of its tasks in the past ten days. Before the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Delyusin work team plans to over fulfill 3,500 meters of rubber tubes, save 2,000 meters of rubber cloth material per shift, and each person will put forward one rationalization proposal.
    During the Communist Labor Brigade movement in this factory, such a thing happened: there were a group of rationalization movement proposers in the factory. Seeing that the factory had launched the Communist Labor Brigade movement, they were very anxious because they were scattered in various workshops and work sections. They could neither organize themselves immediately like other work teams, nor could they immediately launch a production upsurge like them. So they came up with a way to plan a construction fund for the country through the results of their rationalization proposals in the next seven years. The total amount of the fund is 75 million rubles. After this initiative was put forward, the factory's Party committee, Youth League, and trade union organizations immediately organized a discussion throughout the factory and firmly supported their bold initiative. Now this initiative has been universally responded to by various factories in Moscow and has been encouraged by the Moscow Municipal Committee of the CPSU.
    The Menkesh Electric Meter Factory in the northeastern district of Moscow is another factory in my visit plan. This factory mainly produces electric meters for household use. Compared with the above two factories, it is a relatively young factory, and it will be exactly twenty years old this year. When I arrived at the director's office of this factory, before I had time to sit down, Director Kochev talked about the relationship between this factory and the Harbin Electric Meter Factory in our country. On the table near me, there were many gifts sent by the Harbin Electric Meter Factory over the years, including the latest electric meters, photo albums of the factory, and letters between the two factories. The director particularly solemnly expressed to me that he had decided to invite a delegation from the Harbin Electric Meter Factory to participate in their 20th anniversary celebration this year. Then Director Kochev talked about the Communist Labor Brigade movement in this factory. He said that since this factory heard the proposal of the Moscow-Ryazan Railway marshalling station, eleven work teams rose up overnight to strive to establish Communist Labor Brigades. In the past twenty days, with the surge of workers' labor enthusiasm, the production level has been increasing rapidly, and the production plan has been revised from time to time. Before the start of the movement, the labor productivity of this factory was only prepared to increase by 42% in the next seven years, but now it seems that it can be increased to 52%. In the past, this factory produced 500,000 to 600,000 electric meters every year, but according to the recent situation, it can be increased to more than 1.3 million.
    The workers in these factories are working hard and carrying out intense labor. They all want to create heroic miracles in the great communist construction. For more than a month, because they have launched the Communist Labor Brigade movement, the production potential of various factories and enterprises in Moscow is being further developed, the production level and product quality are being further improved, and the spiritual outlook of the working people has undergone significant changes. The Communist Labor Brigade movement is not only a movement of production and thought, but also a movement of all-round communist education for the Soviet people. Undoubtedly, the more universal and deeper this movement will set off an unprecedented large-scale upsurge of communist construction in the Soviet Union, and with the development of this upsurge, the speed of Soviet communist construction will be greatly accelerated, the great ideals of the Soviet people will be realized more quickly, and the spiritual outlook of all the Soviet people will also undergo dramatic changes. The Communist Labor Brigade movement of the Soviet working people will bloom more beautiful and more brilliant flowers in the Soviet communist construction!

    向共产主义跃进的人们
    ——记莫斯科各工厂的共产主义劳动工作队运动
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    一个多月来，从赫鲁晓夫七年计划报告提纲展开全民讨论后，莫斯科进入了既紧张而又热烈的气氛中，打开每天的报纸，那些醒目的、激动人心的标题：“共产主义的光芒照耀着我们的祖国”，“走向共产主义的明天”，振奋着人们的心情。有人说，莫斯科现在是冬天里的春天，它正孕育着共产主义建设的青春的活力，培育着人们前进的意志。在工厂里，为迎接伟大的七年计划所掀起的建立共产主义劳动工作队的运动，正在蓬勃地展开，在共产主义建设的条条战线上，人们正在迈开大步，奋勇地向前跃进。
    一个星期以前，记者访问了莫斯科的三山纺织厂，这是一家已经有一百六十年历史的老工厂，据说列宁曾到过这里十次。三山纺织厂在未来的七年中，无论是纺纱、织布和加工车间，生产率平均要提高50％，产量要从现在每昼夜的七十万公尺提高到九十万公尺，品种要从现在的八百多种提高到接近三千种。他们的口号是：让莫斯科人打扮得更美丽、更漂亮。这个工厂已广泛展开共产主义劳动工作队运动，已有二十二个工作队决定要争取成为共产主义劳动工作队。这个运动的第一炮是由纺纱车间的司米尔诺娃工作队打响的。司米尔诺娃工作队，在这个工厂的任何运动中一向都是打先锋的，而司米尔诺娃本人，虽然年龄不大，但认真负责，工作有计划性，而且能够团结人。司米尔诺娃工作队提出要建立共产主义劳动工作队的条件是这样的：要在六年内完成七年计划，要提高劳动生产率15％，彻底消灭废品和次品，七年中要为工厂节约七万二千卢布，全队工人在两三年内要学会三四种技能，并把自己的技术水平提高到一级的水平。
    织布车间的共产主义劳动工作队运动也搞得热火朝天。车间的入口处，就悬挂着两幅鲜红的标语，一幅是“向光荣的共产主义劳动工作队致敬”，一幅是“今天的工作要比昨天好，明天的工作要比今天好”。这个车间从开展共产主义劳动工作队运动以来，各方面都起了显著的变化。车间的青年女工古习也娃说得好，她说，共产主义劳动工作队运动好像是一面镜子，它把每个人的劳动态度和他对待共产主义建设的关系照得清清楚楚。古习也娃是个共青团员，两星期前刚被批准为苏共候补党员。她还向我们谈到她们的工作队近来发生的变化。她说，自开展共产主义劳动工作队运动以来，变化最大的当然是在生产上，二十多天来她们这个队的生产要比从前提高33％，她们现在每个人管的机器已从八部扩大到十二部。在生产质量上也比从前提高了。工人之间的关系也有改进，现在无论是棉纱断头、机器发生故障或临时缺勤，都是大家抢着帮忙，生活上的互助那更不用说了。学习情绪也高涨了，从前只学一门技术，大家还嚷着说时间不够，现在学技术外还学苏共党史。严格遵守劳动纪律和大胆展开批评和自我批评，也是最近以来最显著的变化之一。
    这一个月内，记者曾两次访问莫斯科橡胶工厂，但每次都给我新鲜的感觉。假使说二十几天前工厂还是热烈讨论七年计划报告提纲的阶段，那么现在工人们已掀起共产主义劳动工作队运动的热潮。这个工厂在开展共产主义劳动工作队运动以来，也有很大的变化，工厂的党委书记阿洛夫告诉我，变化首先是在工人们思想觉悟的提高上，现在的工人们都这样想：不但要生产好，学习好，而且还要思想好；都要按照共产主义全面发展的条件来严格要求自己。
    我访问了这个工厂的第六车间，那是一个专制造各种大小不同的橡皮管的车间。这个车间有四个工作队，人数虽不多，但争取建立共产主义劳动工作队的那股干劲却并不亚于其它车间。车间主任亚历山大介绍我们认识了工作队长杰柳辛，他五年前在军队里当过上尉军官。他一见我们就笑着说，他的工作队连他在内也不过五个人，但现在人数多少是个次要的问题，起决定作用的是他们对待共产主义建设的态度，以及他们自己在工作上的成绩。最近十天来杰柳辛工作队的生产统计表上，一条向上直指的红线，说明着杰柳辛工作队最近十天来的任务都是完成百分之二百。杰柳辛工作队到苏共第二十一次代表大会前，计划要超额完成三千五百公尺橡皮管，节省胶布原料每班二千公尺，每人提出合理化建议一条。
    这个工厂在开展共产主义劳动工作队运动期间，曾发生了这样一件事情：工厂里有一批合理化运动建议者，他们看到工厂开展共产主义劳动工作队运动后，心里非常着急，因为他们分散在各个车间、工段，他们既不能像其它工作队一样马上组织起来，也不能像他们一样马上掀起一个生产的高潮。于是他们想出一个办法，在今后七年中要通过他们合理化建议的成果，为国家筹划一笔建设基金，基金总数是七千五百万卢布。这一倡议提出后，工厂党委、青年团与工会组织马上组织了全厂的讨论，并坚决支持他们这种大胆的创议。现在这一创议已得到莫斯科各工厂的普遍响应，并受到了苏共莫斯科市委的鼓励。
    莫斯科东北区的门基什电表厂，是记者这次访问计划中的另外一个工厂。这个工厂主要是生产生活用的电表，它与上面两个工厂比，算是一个比较年轻的工厂，到今年才整整满二十年。记者到达这个工厂厂长办公室时，还没有来得及坐稳，科契夫厂长就谈起了这个工厂与我国哈尔滨电表厂的关系，在靠近我的那个桌子上，满满地放着哈尔滨电表厂几年来送来的礼品，其中有最新出的电表、工厂的照相簿、两厂来往的信件。厂长特别慎重地向我表示，今年已决定邀请哈尔滨电表厂派一个代表团来参加他们建厂的二十周年典礼。然后科契夫厂长就谈起这个厂的共产主义劳动工作队运动，他说这个厂自从听到莫斯科—梁赞铁路调车站的建议后，一夜之间就有十一个工作队起来争取建立共产主义劳动工作队，最近二十天来，随着工人们劳动热情的高涨，生产水平在急剧地增长，生产计划也不时地进行修改。在运动开始以前，这个工厂的劳动生产率在今后七年只准备提高42％，但现在看起来可以提高到52％，从前这个工厂每年生产电表是五六十万个，但根据最近的情况看，可以提高到一百三十多万个。
    这些工厂的工人们都在鼓起干劲进行着紧张的劳动，他们都想在伟大的共产主义建设中创造出英勇的奇迹。一个多月来，由于他们掀起了共产主义劳动工作队运动，莫斯科各工厂企业的生产潜力正在进一步发挥出来，生产水平和产品质量在进一步提高，劳动人民的精神面貌起了显著的变化。共产主义劳动工作队运动，它不仅是一个生产的运动，思想的运动，而且是一个对苏联人民进行全面的共产主义教育的运动。无疑，这一运动的更加普遍和更加深入，将会在苏联掀起一个前所未有的规模巨大的共产主义建设的高潮，而随着这一高潮的发展，苏联共产主义建设的速度将要大大地加快，苏联人民的伟大的理想将要更快地实现，而全体苏联人民的精神面貌亦将引起急剧的变化。苏联劳动人民的共产主义劳动工作队运动将在苏联共产主义建设中开出更美丽更灿烂的花朵！
