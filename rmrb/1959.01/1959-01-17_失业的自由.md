    “The Freedom of Unemployment”
    Di Liu
    The rulers of Western capitalist countries are accustomed to flaunting the banner of "freedom" and "democracy" to swindle and deceive, but reality is constantly puncturing their lies. The facts provided in the West German film "The Freedom of Unemployment" can also give them a slap in the face.
    When the word "unemployment" is placed before "freedom," its meaning completely changes. It can be said that it has become synonymous with poverty, hunger, crime, and even death; however, in West Germany, under the rule of monopoly capital groups, this terrible "freedom" is wantonly capturing people. Whether it's Danwitz, Edith, or Oswalt in the film, none can escape its clutches!
    Danwitz, Edith, and Oswalt all have kind and upward-striving hearts. They all hoped to engage in medical research and become respected doctors who could truly cure diseases and save people in the future; however, in that dark society, their legitimate freedom was deprived. In order to fill her stomach, Edith had to give up her beloved career and switch to being a fashion model, selling her beauty to support herself and her husband Danwitz; Oswalt had to use his evenings to drive a taxi. Even so, they still couldn't live peacefully. Edith became unemployed because she was pregnant, and Oswalt embarked on an even more tragic path. He illegally performed an abortion, which resulted in an accident, and he was imprisoned for the crime! Such facts show that in that kind of society, people not only have no real freedom but are instead forced into the trap of another kind of terrible "freedom." And such tragedies are not just one or two in West Germany. In West Germany, which is fawning over the United States and where militarism is being revived, the number of unemployed people is constantly increasing. The fate of Edith, Oswalt, and others is just one example among the millions struggling on the brink of starvation.

    “失业的自由”
    邸流
    西方资本主义国家的统治者们，是惯于打着“自由”“民主”之类的幌子招摇撞骗的，但是现实却在在戳破了他们的谎言。西德出品的影片“失业的自由”中所提供的事实也同样可以给他们一记耳光。
    “自由”的前面冠上“失业的”三个字，它的涵义便完全改变了。可以说，它已经成了贫困、饥饿、犯罪、甚至死亡的同义语；然而在垄断资本集团统治下的西德，这种可怕的“自由”却正在恣意地捕获着人们，不管是影片中的丹维茨、爱笛丝、或者奥斯瓦，都无法挣脱它的魔爪！
    丹维茨、爱笛丝和奥斯瓦都有着一颗善良的向上的心。他们都希望能从事医学研究，将来能成为一个受人尊敬的、真正能治病救人的医生；但是在那个黑暗的社会里，他们这种正当的自由却被剥夺了。为了填饱肚子，爱笛丝不得不放弃心爱的事业，改行去做时装模特儿，去出卖色相，来养活自己和供给丈夫丹维茨；奥斯瓦不得不利用晚上的时间去开出租汽车。即或如此，他们仍然不能平安地过下去。爱笛丝因为怀孕而失业了，奥斯瓦则走上了更为可悲的道路，他私自给人堕胎出了事故而犯罪入狱了！这样的事实正表明：在那样的社会里，人们不但没有真正的自由，反而要被逼迫着走入另一类可怕的“自由”的陷阱。而这样的悲剧，在西德又何止一个两个。向美国摇尾乞怜的，军国主义正在死灰复燃的西德，失业的人数在不断增长，爱笛丝、奥斯瓦等的命运，不过是千百万挣扎在饥饿线上的人中的一例罢了。
