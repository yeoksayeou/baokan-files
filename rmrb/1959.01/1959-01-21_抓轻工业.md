Column: Editor's Note

	While focusing on heavy industry, Sichuan, Qinghai and other regions are paying attention to the production of light industrial goods. Giving equal importance to both light and heavy industries is not only a matter of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, but also an important guideline to ensure the improvement of people's lives on the basis of production development.
	Improving people's lives must be guaranteed by material means. The people's daily necessities are nothing more than food, clothing and things for daily use. Apart from some agricultural and sideline products, most of these are light industrial products. Therefore, grasping the production of light industrial goods is also caring for the people's lives; otherwise, it will be difficult to care for the people’s lives.
	Our Party has always paid attention to production, ideology, and life. Grasping ideology means giving prominence to politics, and grasping life means caring about the material lives of the masses. With politics in command and care for the material life of the masses, the enthusiasm of the masses for production will continue to rise.

    抓轻工业
    四川、青海等地在抓重工业的同时注意抓轻工业品生产，轻重工业并举不仅是国民经济有计划按比例发展的问题，而且是保证在生产发展的基础上改善群众生活的重要方针。
    改善群众生活必须有物质做保证，群众日常生活必需品，无非是吃的、穿的、用的。这些，除了一部分农副产品以外，大部分都是轻工业品。因此，抓轻工业品生产，也就是关心群众生活，否则，关心群众生活就会遇到困难。
    我们党从来就注意抓生产、抓思想、抓生活的。抓思想就是政治挂帅，抓生活就是关心群众的物质生活。政治挂帅加上关心群众的物质生活，群众的生产积极性就会不断高涨。
