Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 14th. People's communes in various parts of Gansu Province, adapting to the new situation of bumper harvests of grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar beets, and hemp throughout the province last year, are vigorously developing agricultural product processing industries by making use of local conditions and resources.

Last year, Gansu Province's grain output doubled compared to 1957, sugar beet output increased dozens of times, and the output of other cash crops was also much higher than in previous years. The equipment capacity of the existing agricultural product processing industry was far from being able to adapt to this situation. The processing capacity for oilseeds and grain was only about one-third of what was needed, and the processing capacity for sugar beets was even weaker. To this end, the industrial, commercial, and grain departments at the provincial and prefectural levels of Gansu Province, in addition to accelerating the construction of a number of sugar factories, cotton spinning mills, oil presses, and potato-to-alcohol factories, also manufactured a large number of small and semi-mechanized equipment and mobilized technical forces to help rural people's communes establish agricultural product processing networks, changing the situation where most agricultural product processing plants were concentrated in cities in the past.

At present, cities such as Lanzhou and Tianshui have transferred thousands of oil presses, light flour mills, flax peeling machines, potato slicing and sugar-making centrifugal honey separators to rural areas. After having centrifugal honey separators, people's communes in various places, equipped with铡knives and iron pots, quickly built more than two hundred indigenous sugar factories. Farmers also built a number of potato processing factories using potato slicing machines and self-built drying walls and earth beds, processing potatoes into starch, potato flour, and dried potatoes. After the people's communes in various flax producing areas universally established flax processing plants, tens of millions of kilograms of flax stalks that were inconvenient to transport were first processed into flax and then transported to cities. Various places also built dozens of small flour mills and small oil presses in wheat and oilseed producing areas.

People's communes in various places also use water mills, dry mills, and indigenous presses to process grain and oilseeds. Some water mills and dry mills have been equipped with ball bearings, and a number of horse-drawn revolving mills and vertical three-fan mills have also been promoted, which can increase work efficiency by half to two times respectively. The daily grain processing capacity of water mills and dry mills in Longxi County has increased from 700,000 kilograms to 4 million kilograms.

The establishment of agricultural product processing networks in Gansu Province, adapting to local conditions and appropriately decentralized, has already shown many benefits: 1. After agricultural products are processed locally, a large amount of transportation resources can be saved for other aspects, and a lot of transportation costs can also be saved; 2. Local processing and local sales can reduce the phenomenon of a portion of agricultural products being sent to cities for processing and then transported back to rural areas for supply, wasting manpower and financial resources; 3. Processed by-products such as oil cake, bran, and distiller's grains can be used to feed livestock or as fertilizer; 4. It has accelerated the industrialization of people's communes.

    满足当地需要　节省运输力量　促进公社工业化
    甘肃各公社大办农产品加工厂
    新华社兰州14日电　甘肃省各地人民公社，适应去年全省粮食、棉花、油料、甜菜、大麻大丰收的新形势，因地制宜，就地取材，大力发展农产品加工工业。
    甘肃省去年粮食产量比1957年翻了一番，甜菜产量增加了好几十倍，其它经济作物的产量也远较往年为多。原有农产品加工工业的设备能力远不能和这种形势相适应。油料和粮食的加工能力不足三分之一左右，甜菜的加工能力更为薄弱。为此，甘肃省省级和专区级工业、商业、粮食部门除加速建设一批糖厂、棉纺厂、榨油厂、洋芋制酒精厂外，还制造了大批小型的和半机械化的设备，并调动技术力量，帮助农村人民公社建立农产品加工网，改变了过去农产品加工厂大部分集中在城市的情况。
    现在，兰州、天水等城市已调了数千部榨油机、轻便磨粉机、亚麻剥皮机、洋芋切片和制糖用的离心分蜜机运往农村。各地人民公社有了离心分蜜机后，配上铡刀、铁锅，迅速地建起了二百多个土法制糖厂。农民们并用洋芋切片机和自砌的烘墙、土炕，建起了一批洋芋加工工厂，把洋芋加工成淀粉、洋芋面和洋芋干。各亚麻产区的人民公社普遍建立亚麻加工厂后，使运输不便的数千万斤亚麻秆，先加工成亚麻后再运往城市。各地还在小麦和油料产地建起数十个小型面粉厂和小型榨油厂。
    各地人民公社还用水磨、旱磨、土榨加工粮食和油籽等。有些水磨、旱磨并已装上滚珠，有的还推广了一批马拉回盘磨和立式三扇磨，可以分别提高工作效率半倍到二倍左右。陇西县的水磨、旱磨，每天加工粮食的能力已从七十万斤提高到四百万斤。
    甘肃省因地制宜、适当分散地建立农产品加工网，已经体现出许多好处：一、农产品就地加工后，可节省一大批运输力量用于其它方面，还可节省许多运费；二、就地加工，就地销售，可以减少一部分农产品送往城市加工后，又由城市运回农村供应，浪费人力、财力的现象；三、加工后的副产品如油饼、麸皮、酒糟等，可以用来喂牲口或做肥料；四、加速了人民公社的工业化。（附图片）
