    A Good Way to Promote Commodity Production in People's Communes

    The commercial departments of Wei Shan County, by signing purchase and sales contracts with the people's communes, have greatly promoted the development of commodity production in the people's communes and increased the supply of agricultural and sideline products for the state. This is a very good method.

    While developing self-sufficient production to directly meet the needs of the commune, it is essential that the people's communes vigorously develop commodity production according to their own characteristics, thereby expanding commodity exchange between communes and the state, and between communes themselves. This is necessary to meet the diverse needs of society for commodities, invigorate the economic lives of the broad masses, and increase the cash income of the communes. The commodity production of communes should be carried out in a planned way, such as what to produce, how much to produce, what varieties, what specifications, and so on. These issues should be resolved in a planned manner. The system of commercial departments signing production and sales contracts with the people's communes is a good way to solve these problems. Commercial departments are familiar with and master the market situation, which is convenient for guiding the people's communes to produce according to the needs of the state, and then fix the quantity, specifications, quality, and delivery date of the commodities that the commune plans to produce through contracts. In this way, not only is the source of goods purchased by the state guaranteed, but also the people's communes have a direction for production, and there is no worry about the sales of products. With the help of commercial departments, communes can also get support in terms of production raw materials, funds, and technology in commodity production. Because the contract has binding power, it can play a supervisory role on both parties signing the contract, prompting both parties to go all out and strive for the upstream to achieve the goals stipulated in the contract. There is no doubt that this will play a positive role in strengthening the planning of people's commune production and promoting the development of people's commune commodity production. The fact that the commercial departments of Wei Shan County signed contracts and greatly developed the commodity production of the communes is a good illustration of this.

    Through signing contracts with commercial departments, the people's communes in Wei Shan County can greatly develop commodity production and increase the cash income of the communes. At the same time, in the process of signing contracts, the commune members can further understand the current national needs for agricultural and sideline products, and in the spirit of taking care of the needs of the state first, they sell many agricultural and sideline products that they did not originally intend to sell to the state. This fully shows that the implementation of the contract system not only promotes the development of commodity production in the communes, but also embodies the noble spirit of mutual support between urban and rural areas under the socialist system. At the same time, the conclusion of this kind of contract is also necessary to reflect the socialist planned economy.

    It can be imagined that if the commercial departments and people's communes in various regions start by signing production and sales contracts for agricultural and sideline products, and gradually and actively promote the contract system from small to large, from less to more, and from unilateral to multilateral, they will combine the relationship between the state and the people's communes, the relationship between communes, and the relationship between urban and rural areas more closely. The more widely this contract system is implemented, the more it can promote the development of commodity production, increase the income of the communes, consolidate the people's communes, and better meet the needs of the broad masses of people's production and life.

    促进人民公社发展商品生产的好办法
    巍山县的商业部门通过和人民公社签订购销合同的办法，既大大促进了人民公社商品性生产的发展，又为国家增加了农副产品货源。这是一个十分好的办法。
    人民公社在发展直接满足本社需要的自给性生产的同时，根据本社的特点大力发展商品性生产，从而扩大公社和国家、公社和公社之间的商品交换，对于满足社会上对商品的多方面需要，活跃广大人民经济生活，增加公社的现金收入，都是十分必要的。公社的商品性生产要有计划地进行，比如生产什么，生产多少，什么品种，什么规格等等。这些问题都应当有计划地解决。商业部门和人民公社签订产销合同的制度，就是解决这些问题的一个好办法。商业部门熟悉和掌握市场情况，便于指导人民公社根据国家需要进行生产，再把公社准备生产的商品数量、规格、质量以及交货的日期等项目通过合同固定下来。这样，不但国家收购的商品货源有了保证，同时人民公社的生产有了方向，也不愁产品的销路问题。在商业部门的帮助下，公社在商品生产中，在生产原料、资金、技术等方面也可以得到支援。由于合同具有约束力量，这就能够对签订合同的双方起督促的作用，促使双方为实现合同规定的目标而鼓足干劲力争上游。毫无疑问，这对于加强人民公社生产的计划性，促进人民公社商品生产的发展，会起着积极的促进作用。巍山县商业部门和人民公社签订合同大大发展了公社的商品生产的事实，就是很好的说明。
    巍山县各人民公社通过和商业部门签订合同，既可以大大发展商品生产，增加公社现金收入，同时在签订合同过程中也使公社社员进一步了解到当前国家对农副产品的需要情况，本着先照顾国家需要的精神，把原来不打算出卖的许多农副产品也卖给国家。这就充分说明，推行合同制度不仅仅能促进公社商品生产的发展，还体现了在社会主义制度下城乡互相支援的高尚精神。同时订立这种合同也是体现社会主义计划经济所必需的。
    可以设想，各地商业部门和人民公社，从签订农副产品的产销合同入手，并逐步地、积极地由小到大，由少到多，由单边到多边地推行合同制度，将会把国家和人民公社的关系、公社和公社的关系、城乡之间的关系结合得更加紧密。这种合同制度越是广泛地推行，就越可以促进商品生产的发展，增加公社的收入，巩固人民公社和更好地满足广大人民生产、生活的需要。
