Xinhua News Agency, Bonn—West German Chancellor Adenauer, on the 12th, rejected the new Soviet proposal regarding discussions on concluding a German peace treaty with an extremely stubborn attitude. He once again repeated the bankrupt platitude that "a German peace treaty can only be concluded with an all-German government produced through free elections."

Adenauer stated that he opposed the view that it is now necessary to make a "counter-proposal." This means that he is prepared to continue to treat the new Soviet proposal with a rigid attitude of rejection, and does not intend to put forward any practical and feasible solutions.

Adenauer's opinion was expressed before the governments of the United States, Britain, and France had expressed their attitude towards the Soviet proposal. The Council of the Christian Democratic Union—Christian Social Union parliamentary group held a secret meeting today. After the meeting, the group released the above-mentioned remarks made by Adenauer at the meeting.

Adenauer used the statement that "the Soviet offensive has now expanded to the entire Federal Republic" to intimidate dissenting opposition parties. He demanded that all parties in Bonn maintain "unity."

    阿登纳顽固拒绝苏联建议
    据新华社波恩讯　西德总理阿登纳12日以极其顽固的态度拒绝苏联关于讨论缔结对德和约的新建议。他再一次重复“对德和约只能同一个通过自由选举产生的全德政府来缔结”这种已经破了产的滥言。
    阿登纳表示他反对那种认为现在必须作出“反建议”的主张。这就是说，他准备继续用僵硬的拒绝态度来对待苏联的新建议，而不打算提出任何切实可行的办法来。
    阿登纳这种意见是在美英法三国政府还没有就苏联的建议表示态度的时候发表的。基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟议会党团理事会今天举行了秘密会议。这个党团在会后发表了阿登纳在会上所作的上述谈话。
    阿登纳用所谓“苏联的进攻现在已经扩大到整个联邦共和国”的说法来对持有分歧意见的反对党派进行恫吓。他要求波恩所有党派保持“团结一致”。
