Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi,
Dear Comrades and Friends:

On behalf of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, I extend a heartfelt welcome to the representatives of the great fraternal Chinese people, the representatives of other socialist brother countries, and the representatives of countries friendly to us. At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity, before my departure, to extend brotherly greetings to the brave socialist builders defending peace in the Far East – the entire Chinese people – and express our admiration for their outstanding achievements.

In the process of interacting with Chinese comrades and friends, we have gained new and valuable insights for our own work. Everything we have seen in the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China is the realization of Marxism-Leninism, the creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory in China, and a powerful demonstration of Marx's statement that "theory, once it grips the masses, becomes a material force." For us Germans – descendants of Marx and Engels – this is a profound and educational experience.

The enthusiasm and creativity of the Chinese people have left us with an unforgettable impression.

We once again feel with joy, gratitude, and pride that the Chinese people harbor sincere and friendly feelings towards the German people and are always ready, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, to support the German people in their socialist construction and in their struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their motherland.

I would also like to assure you that the working people of the German Democratic Republic and the progressive forces of the entire German people will give the Chinese people more effective support in their struggle for a happy future.

The tremendous achievements made by the socialist family to date demonstrate the enthusiasm of the working people of these countries in building socialism. However, it would not have been possible to achieve these achievements without the active application of the principles of proletarian internationalism. The fraternal close cooperation between the various countries and peoples of the socialist camp is based on these principles. A Chinese proverb says it well: "Many hands make light work." Yes, our flame is rising higher and higher, but this is not a flame of destruction, but a flame of our common strength and enthusiasm.

In this regard, the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, signed on December 25, 1955, is of great significance. The relationship between our two brotherly countries has been continuously developed and consolidated on the basis of this treaty. This treaty is also the basis for the talks conducted by the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic during its current visit to the People's Republic of China and the joint statement we issued today. The complete consensus reached on all the issues discussed is not only a manifestation of the relationship between our two brotherly countries, but also another manifestation of the unity of the socialist family striving for common goals.

We can point out with satisfaction that in the past three years, the balance of power in the world has undergone tremendous changes favorable to peace and socialism. The superiority of the socialist system has been demonstrated once again, especially through the control figures of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan and the launch of cosmic rockets.

Both sides welcome the Soviet Union's proposal of January 10, 1959, on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and regard it as an effective step towards easing tensions in Europe and the national revival of Germany.

Both sides expressed their determination to continue to comprehensively develop friendly relations in the future. To this end, our two countries have signed a treaty on consular relations and reached an agreement to establish a consulate general in Shanghai. In addition, it is stipulated to increase the volume of foreign trade in 1959 and sign a treaty of commerce and navigation and a long-term trade agreement.

Both sides reiterated that they will continue to tirelessly strengthen and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp in the future.

Comrades and friends, I propose,

To the unbreakable friendship, brotherly cooperation, and unity of the invincible socialist family headed by the Soviet Union,

To the further and closer cooperation and our unbreakable friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China,

For the happiness and prosperity of our two peoples,

To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

To the strength of the great and glorious Communist Party of China,

To all members of the Government of the People's Republic of China,

To understanding and cooperation between all countries, and to the maintenance of world peace,

Cheers!

    在共同斗争中相互支持
    格罗提渥在德驻华大使宴会上的讲话
    亲爱的刘少奇同志，
    亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我代表德意志民主共和国政府代表团向伟大的兄弟中国人民的出席代表、其他社会主义兄弟国家以及同我们友好的国家的代表表示衷心的欢迎。同时我愿意在这里在临别前向在远东捍卫着和平的勇敢的社会主义建设者——全中国人民——致以兄弟般的敬礼，并对他们的卓越成就表示我们的敬佩。
   在同中国同志和朋友相处的过程中，我们为我们自己的工作获得了新的、宝贵的启示。我们在中华人民共和国社会主义建设中所见到的一切，都是马克思列宁主义的实现，是马克思列宁主义理论在中国的创造性的运用，是马克思所说的“理论一旦掌握群众就变成巨大的物质力量”这一句话的有力证明。对于我们德国人——马克思和恩格斯的子孙——来说，这是一个深刻而富有教育意义的经历。
    中国人民的热情与创造力给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    我们怀着愉快、感激与自豪的心情再一次感到，中国人民对德国人民怀着诚挚友好的感情，并随时准备以无产阶级国际主义的精神支持德国人民进行社会主义建设和进行和平民主恢复祖国统一的斗争。
    我也愿意向你们保证：德意志民主共和国的劳动人民和全体德国人民的进步力量在中国人民争取幸福未来的斗争中将给予他们更有效的支持。
    社会主义大家庭迄今所取得的巨大成就，表明了这些国家的劳动人民建设社会主义的热情。可是，如果不积极地运用无产阶级国际主义的原则，取得这些成就是不可能的。社会主义阵营各个国家和人民的兄弟般的亲密合作就是建立在这些原则的基础上的。中国有句成语说得很对：“众人拾柴火焰高”。是的，我们的火焰升得越来越高，可是这并不是毁灭之火，而是我们的共同力量和热情的火焰。
    在这方面，1955年12月25日德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国缔结的友好合作条约是具有重大意义的。我们这两个兄弟国家的关系在这个条约的基础上不断地得到发展和巩固。这个条约也是德意志民主共和国政府代表团目前在中华人民共和国访问期间所进行的会谈和今天我们发表的联合声明的基础。双方在所有讨论到的问题上都取得了完全一致的看法，这不只是我们这两个兄弟国家的关系，同时也是为共同目标奋斗的社会主义大家庭的团结一致的又一表现。
    我们可以满意地指出：最近三年来世界力量对比已发生了有利于和平和社会主义的巨大变化，社会主义制度的优越性特别是通过苏联七年计划的控制数字和发射宇宙火箭再一次得到证明。
    双方对1959年1月10日苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议表示欢迎，并把它看作是缓和欧洲紧张局势和德国民族复兴的一个有效步骤。
    双方表示决心今后也要全面地进一步发展友好关系。为此目的，我们两国签订了一个关于领事关系的条约，并达成了在上海设立总领事馆的协议。此外还规定增加1959年的对外贸易额，并签订通商航海条约和长期贸易协定。
    双方再次声明将来也要孜孜不倦地增强和巩固社会主义阵营的团结。
    同志们、朋友们，我建议，
    为以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义大家庭的牢不可破的友谊、兄弟般的合作和团结一致，
    为德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的进一步的更密切的合作和我们的牢不可破的友谊，
    为我们两国人民的幸福和繁荣，
    为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的健康，
    为伟大的光荣的中国共产党的强大，
    为中华人民共和国政府的所有成员，
    为一切国家的谅解和合作、为全世界和平的维护，
    干杯！
