　　Editorial Postscript

    The article "An Exploration of Wheat Close Planting Problems" puts forward views on the degree of wheat close planting, and also puts forward methods to remedy excessively dense wheat fields. Whether those views are completely correct and whether the remedial measures are completely effective remain to be proven by practice, and also await everyone's joint discussion and research. However, the comrades of the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science are able to closely integrate scientific research with current production, and this practice is worth greatly promoting.

    The phenomenon of excessive sowing of winter wheat fields also exists in other regions to varying degrees. The problem raised in this "work study" has a certain universal significance. It is hoped that the agricultural scientific experiment and research departments at all levels in the winter wheat regions will also pay close attention to this issue, and introduce their research results as soon as possible. This is extremely important for ensuring a greater bumper harvest this summer.

    科学研究的方向
    “关于小麦密植问题的探讨”一文里，提出了对小麦密植程度的看法，还提出了补救过度密植麦田的办法。那些看法是不是完全正确，补救办法是不是完全有效，还有待实践证明，也有待大家共同讨论和研究。但是西北生物土壤研究所的同志能密切结合当前生产进行科学研究，这种作法值得大大提倡。
    冬麦田播种量过多的现象，别的地区或多或少也有，这篇“工作研究”中提出的问题，是有一定普遍意义的。希望各冬麦区的各级农业科学试验研究部门，也密切地注意这个问题，并把自己的研究结果尽早地介绍出来。这对保证今年夏季更大丰收有极重要的作用。
