Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th: Our correspondent reports: The relationship of economic mutual assistance and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is developing more and more closely. During the Seven-Year Plan, the economic mutual assistance and cooperation between the Soviet Union and various socialist countries will enter a new stage of development.

In the economic cooperation among socialist countries, the Soviet Union has first given all brother countries multi-faceted, large-scale, and selfless assistance. From the day of the establishment of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union has been providing these countries with enormous economic assistance. Up to now, the loans granted by the Soviet Union to various socialist countries have reached nearly 30 billion rubles, and these loans have played a significant role in the recovery and development of the national economies of the brother countries. The Soviet Union also directly helps various socialist countries with construction. Currently, it is helping these countries build a total of more than 500 projects, including 462 factories and 120 separate workshops. Among these factories, 211 are being built with assistance to China. In addition, the Soviet Union has sent more than 15,000 experts to various brother countries to help them with construction or exchange experiences. The socialist countries of Europe and Asia have also sent more than 10,000 experts to the Soviet Union for study or visits. The Soviet Union also trains a large number of young technical cadres for various countries. The Soviet Union also helps brother countries master the peaceful use of atomic energy, and has helped China, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia and other countries establish atomic reactors and accelerators, as well as various other cutting-edge sciences.

The trade relations between the Soviet Union and various socialist countries are developing every year, which is an important form of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among the brother countries. According to statistics, the trade volume with various socialist countries currently accounts for about 75% of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade volume.

Last year was a year of further prosperity in trade between the Soviet Union and various socialist countries. Trade between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia was further expanded last year. Currently, one-third of Czechoslovakia's foreign trade is conducted with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union provides Czechoslovakia with iron ore and other metallurgical raw materials, while Czechoslovakia provides the Soviet Union with medium-sized machinery. Last year, the Soviet Union further expanded its exports of important industrial raw materials and other products to the German Democratic Republic, with coal exports increasing by 12% compared to 1952 and steel exports increasing by 16%. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Albania increased by about 30% last year compared to 1957. The Soviet Union exported a large number of machines and agricultural machinery to Albania, and also provided Albania with wheat, rice and vegetable oil worth a total of 31 million rubles. Trade between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria has also made new progress. The Soviet Union's exports of metallurgical raw materials, petroleum industry products and synthetic rubber to Bulgaria are of particular importance to Bulgaria's industrial development. In the past, Bulgaria's exports to the Soviet Union were mostly agricultural products, but starting last year, it has begun to export heavy industrial products such as electric motors and transformers to the Soviet Union. In addition, the trade relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary and the Mongolian People's Republic have also further developed.

With the development of economic construction in the Soviet Union and various socialist countries, the economic mutual assistance and cooperation between these countries will be further strengthened in the future. According to the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, by 1965, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and socialist countries will increase by more than 50% compared to last year. For example, during the period of 1958-1960, the average annual trade volume between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic will increase from approximately 4 billion rubles to 7 billion rubles, compared with the average figure during the period of 1952-1955. Economic cooperation in other areas will also develop. According to the decision of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, when the Soviet Union and the seven socialist countries in Europe formulate their national economic outlook plans, they have all considered the coordination among these countries in developing their economies and certain divisions of labor in industrial production, which will greatly promote the specialization of production in these countries.

    苏联大力帮助兄弟国家建设
    七年内同各国贸易额将增加一半以上
    新华社莫斯科26日电　本社记者报道：苏联同其他社会主义国家的经济互助合作关系发展得日益密切。在七年计划期间，苏联同各社会主义国家的经济互助合作将进入新的发展阶段。
    在社会主义阵营各国的经济合作中，苏联首先给了所有兄弟国家以多方面的、大量的无私的援助。从欧亚各人民民主国家成立之日起，苏联一直对这些国家进行巨大的经济援助。到目前为止，苏联给予各社会主义国家的贷款已经达到将近三百亿卢布，这些贷款对恢复和发展各兄弟国家的国民经济起了重大作用。苏联还直接帮助各社会主义国家进行建设，现在，它帮助这些国家建设的项目总共有五百多项，其中包括四百六十二个工厂企业和一百二十个单独的车间。这些工厂企业中，有二百一十一个是帮助中国建设的。此外，苏联还派了一万五千多名专家到各兄弟国家帮助它们进行建设或交流经验。欧、亚各社会主义国家也派了一万多个专家去苏联学习或参观。苏联还为各国培养大批青年技术干部。苏联还帮助各兄弟国家掌握原子能的和平利用，帮助中国、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克等国建立了原子反应堆和加速器以及其他各种尖端科学。
    苏联同各社会主义国家的贸易关系每年都在发展，这是各兄弟国家进行经济互助合作的重要形式之一。据统计，在苏联对外贸易总额中，同各社会主义国家的贸易额目前已占75％左右。
    去年是苏联同各社会主义国家的贸易进一步繁荣的一年。苏联同捷克斯洛伐克的贸易在去年进一步扩大了。目前，捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易额中，有三分之一是同苏联进行的。苏联向捷克斯洛伐克提供铁矿砂和其他冶金原料，捷克斯洛伐克则为苏联提供中型机械。去年，苏联进一步扩大了对德意志民主共和国重要工业原料和其他产品的输出，其中，煤的出口量比1952年增加了12％，钢材出口量增加了16％。苏联去年同阿尔巴尼亚的贸易额比1957年增加了30％左右，苏联向阿尔巴尼亚输出了大批机器和农业机械，此外还向阿尔巴尼亚提供了总值为三千一百万卢布的小麦、大米和植物油。苏联同保加利亚的贸易也有了新的发展。苏联向保加利亚输出的冶金原料、石油工业产品和人造橡胶等，对保加利亚的工业发展有着特别重要的作用。保加利亚过去对苏联的出口货大多是农产品，而从去年起，则已开始向苏联输出电动机、变压器等重工业产品。此外，苏联同匈牙利、蒙古人民共和国的贸易关系也进一步发展了。
    随着苏联和各社会主义国家经济建设的发展，今后这些国家之间的经济互助合作还将进一步加强。根据七年计划控制数字，到1965年，苏联同社会主义国家的贸易额将比去年增加50％以上。例如，在1958—1960年期间，苏联同德意志民主共和国的每年平均贸易额，同1952—1955年期间的平均数字相比，将从大约四十亿卢布增加到七十亿卢布。其他方面的经济合作关系也将发展。根据八国经济互助委员会的决定，苏联同欧洲的七个社会主义国家在制定本国的经济远景计划时，都考虑到了这些国家之间在发展经济方面彼此配合和在工业生产上进行某些分工的问题，这将大大促进这些国家的生产专业化。（附图片）
