    A Bucket of Fertilizer, a Basket of Grain
    Who says there are many stars in the sky?
    There are more dung pits on the ground.
    The stars in the sky are one by one,
    The dung pits on the ground are as dense as sieves.
    People depend on grain, land depends on fertilizer,
    One load of manure, one basket of grain,
    In spring, fertilizer piles up like mountains,
    In autumn, grain flows like a river.
      (Liaoning Folk Song)

    一桶肥一箩粮
    谁说天上星星多？
    那有地下粪坑多。
    天上星星个挨个，
    地下粪坑密如箩。
    人靠粮食地靠肥，
    一担粪肥粮一箩，
    春天肥料堆成山，
    秋季粮食流成河。
      （辽宁民歌）
