Editorial: Electricity Must Catch Up

    Like all of China's construction endeavors, the electricity industry had a significant leap forward in 1958. Over one hundred newly built and expanded large and medium-sized power stations were put into production. The newly added generating equipment was equivalent to more than two-thirds of the total newly added generating equipment during the First Five-Year Plan, exceeding the total generating capacity left over from old China in 1949 by 10%. Electricity generation increased by 47% compared to 1957, a growth rate rarely seen in the world. However, due to the emergence of the new situation of taking steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward, the growth rate of electricity, although rapid, still cannot meet the needs of the rapid growth in industry and other fields. Especially in order to achieve a more magnificent leap forward in 1959, more electricity is needed. Therefore, how to make electricity catch up quickly has become a prominent issue on the industrial front.
    As everyone knows, the development of modern industry is closely related to electricity. Every industrial product has a certain electricity consumption quota. To fully utilize the potential of each industrial sector, a sufficient supply of electricity is needed. Compared with other industrial production, due to the limitation of the rated capacity of the equipment itself, the potential of electricity production is limited, and the product cannot be stored. At the same time, the production of complete sets of equipment such as power generation, transmission, transformation, and electricity consumption is also more complicated. These characteristics of the electricity industry itself indicate that it should have room for maneuver and a certain reserve force to meet the needs of the rapid development of the entire industry at any time, without becoming a weak link hindering industrial development. From the practice of the First Five-Year Plan, especially the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have realized that in the high-speed development of the entire industry, electricity must have a faster development speed and must become a veritable "vanguard." Therefore, in the greater leap forward of 1959, the electricity industry will develop faster than in 1958, and the increase in the production of electrical equipment will be the largest.
    To greatly increase generating equipment within a year is an unprecedented leap forward in the history of China's electricity development. Because by the end of 1958, the 6.4 million kilowatts of generating equipment owned by China had been accumulated over decades. When the country was liberated in 1949, old China only left us 1.85 million kilowatts of generating equipment. The other 4.55 million kilowatts were newly added from 1950 to 1958. Moreover, most of the newly added generating equipment was imported from abroad, and domestic production only accounted for a small part, that is, a total of 250,000 kilowatts were produced during the First Five-Year Plan, and more than 800,000 kilowatts were produced in 1958. The generating equipment to be produced this year will increase many times compared to what was produced last year, and most of the equipment will be produced domestically. This is a great and arduous task. This task must be resolutely completed, only in this way can the completion and over-completion of the 18 million tons of steel and the entire industrial production plan be guaranteed.
    In order to complete this arduous task, the first thing is to complete the manufacturing of electrical equipment according to the plan, and the main key to equipment manufacturing lies in the supply of various raw materials. Therefore, the two marshals of metallurgy and machinery, and all regions across the country, especially the Northeast and Shanghai, should make every effort to solve the manufacturing problems of electrical equipment, especially a series of complete sets of equipment for power generation, transmission, distribution, transformation, and electricity consumption. This is much more complicated than solving the manufacturing of metallurgical equipment and general machinery. The relevant departments have already paid attention to the production of the main engines in generating equipment, but the supporting equipment is still a weak link. This requires mobilizing relevant enterprises across the country to make great efforts together to solve the problem. Therefore, to carry out the mass movement of running electricity, the first thing to do is to grasp the manufacturing of electrical equipment. Secondly, the construction of power stations itself must be able to keep up. The key issue in this regard is how to do everything possible from design to construction, overcome the difficulties of insufficient steel, cement, and wood, speed up construction, and ensure the quality of the project so that hydropower and thermal power plants can be completed on schedule and put into production. What all localities need to pay special attention to is that among the water conservancy projects that have been completed and will be completed this year (mostly in the first half of the year), the small and medium-sized hydropower stations that can be combined with power generation will be at least about 2 million kilowatts. Many provinces can solve the equipment manufacturing of these power stations themselves. We believe that in electricity construction, as long as politics take command, continue to boldly mobilize the masses, everyone thinks of more ways, comes up with more ideas, carries out technological revolution, and fully promotes the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" method, the task of increasing generating equipment in 1959 will definitely be completed.
    A large increase in generating equipment is mainly the task of modern large enterprises, but according to the electricity demand of the 1959 national economic plan, it is not enough to only have "large foreign groups." It is also necessary to have the cooperation of "small indigenous groups" and walk on two legs to alleviate the tense electricity situation. The method of running electricity by "small indigenous groups" in Northeast China should continue to be promoted throughout the country so that it can play a greater role. It is easy to understand that "large foreign groups" should be the main force in electricity industry construction. However, it is not easy for people to accept that electricity can also be used by "small indigenous groups" in cities and industries, and electricity can also be run with "indigenous" methods. Some people may feel that this is a step backward. It is true that from the phenomenon, we seem to be "taking a step backward"; but from the essence, we are racing against time to catch up to the front. Last year, the Northeast region, including large industrial cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, and Anshan, jointly established "small indigenous groups" power stations with a total capacity of about 300,000 kilowatts. Dalian alone established 130,000 kilowatts, which provided rich experience in this regard. These experiences prove that it is possible to launch a mass movement to run electricity. As long as the masses are mobilized, not only the speed is accelerated, but also there are many ways; all available power resources are mobilized, and all available old equipment is put to good use. The reason why "small indigenous groups" are easy to establish is because they have the characteristics of "small" and "indigenous". Under the current circumstances, generally speaking, "small" refers to a power generation capacity of less than 200 or 300 kilowatts; "indigenous" means that equipment and materials use as little as possible special materials such as steel and silicon steel sheets allocated by the state, and replace them with indigenous ones as much as possible. Of course, such small and indigenous power stations generally cannot meet the needs of large-scale production, but they are still very effective in solving lighting and driving medium and small-sized machines. At the same time, the so-called "small" and "indigenous" content and form are changing with time and place and can gradually develop to a higher stage. After continuous consolidation and improvement in technology, the "small indigenous groups" gradually develop into "small foreign groups," and their role will be even greater.
    In short, the facts in the Northeast vividly illustrate: First, the movement of running electricity by "small indigenous groups" is combined with the urgent need of the broad masses to develop production, and it has great practical significance in alleviating the current tight electricity situation. Second, small and indigenous power stations are not only suitable for rural areas and small and medium-sized towns, but also can be built in industrial cities and advanced factories and mines. Third, the mass movement of running electricity with small and indigenous as the main force can promote the mass technological revolution, combining indigenous and foreign methods, replacing foreign with indigenous, and developing foreign methods from indigenous methods. The development can accelerate the early realization of electrification throughout the country and prepare a mass foundation for future modern large-scale electricity construction. All localities should use the experience of the Northeast to carry out a mass movement of running electricity, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and walking on two legs as early as possible.
    On the one hand, strive to run the "large foreign groups" well; on the other hand, fully mobilize the "small indigenous groups." As long as we do this, we will definitely be able to gradually solve the problem of tight electricity, and electricity will definitely be able to catch up.

    电力必须赶上前去
    和我国各项建设事业一样，1958年我国的电力工业也有了一个很大的跃进：一百多座新建和扩建的大中型电站投入生产，新增的发电设备等于第一个五年计划期间新增发电设备总和的三分之二以上，比1949年旧中国遗留下的全部发电能力还多10％。发电量比1957年增长了47％，这样高的增长速度在世界上也是少有的。然而，由于以钢为纲、全面跃进的新形势的出现，电力增长的速度虽然很快，但仍不能满足工业及其它方面的急剧增长的需要。特别是为了实现1959年更宏伟的跃进，需要更多的电力。因此，如何使电力迅速赶上前去，就成为当前工业战线上一个突出的问题。
    大家知道，现代工业的发展是和电力密切不可分的，每一种工业产品都有它一定的耗电定额。为了充分发挥每个工业部门的潜力，就需要有足够的电力供应。和其他工业生产比较起来，由于设备本身的定额容量的限制，电力生产的潜力是有一定限度的，而且产品又不能储存；同时，发电、送电、变电、用电等全套设备的生产也比较复杂。电力工业本身的这些特点说明应当让它留有余地，有一定的后备力量，才能随时满足整个工业迅速发展的需要，而不致成为阻碍工业发展的薄弱环节。从第一个五年计划特别是1958年全面大跃进的实践中，我们认识到，在整个工业高速度发展中，电力必须有更快的发展速度，必须让它成为名副其实的“先行官”。因此，在1959年更伟大的跃进中，电力工业将比1958年发展得更快，电力设备需要增产的倍数最大。
    在一年中要求大大地增加发电设备，这是我国电力发展史上一个空前的跃进。因为到1958年为止，我国所拥有的六百四十万瓩发电设备是经过几十年才积累起来的。1949年全国解放的时候，旧中国只留给我们一百八十五万瓩发电设备，其他四百五十五万瓩是1950年到1958年新增加的；而且新增的发电设备大部分是由国外进口的，国内生产的只占一小部分，即第一个五年计划共生产了二十五万瓩，1958年生产八十多万瓩。今年一年要生产的发电设备要比去年所生产的成倍地增加，而其中大部分设备又都要由国内生产，这是一个伟大而艰巨的任务。这个任务必须坚决完成，只有这样才能保证一千八百万吨钢和整个工业生产计划的完成和超额完成。
    为了完成这个艰巨的任务，首先是要按计划完成电力设备的制造，而设备制造的主要关键又在各种原材料的供应。因此，冶金和机械两个元帅，全国各个地区特别是东北和上海两地，应当尽一切努力解决电力设备，特别是发电、送电、配电、变电、用电等一系列的成套设备的制造问题。这比解决冶金设备和一般机械的制造要复杂得多。对于发电设备中主机的生产，有关部门已经注意了，但是配套设备还是一个薄弱环节。这需要动员全国各地有关企业共同作巨大的努力，才能得到解决。所以，开展全民办电运动，首先就要抓紧电力设备的制造。其次是电站建设本身要能赶得上去。这方面的关键问题就在如何从设计到施工，想尽千方百计，克服钢材、水泥、木材等不足的困难，既要加快建设速度，又能保证工程质量，使水、火电站都能如期完工，交付生产。各地需要特别注意安排的是，目前各地已经完工和今年将要完工（大部分在上半年）的水利工程中，可以结合发电的中小水电站至少有二百万瓩左右。这些电站的设备制造，许多省份都是可以自己解决的。我们相信，在电力建设上，只要政治挂帅，继续放手发动群众，大家多想办法，多出主意，开展技术革命，全面推广“两参、一改、三结合”的办法，1959年增加发电设备的任务是一定能够完成的。
    大量地增加发电设备，主要是现代化的大企业的任务，但是根据1959年国民经济计划的用电要求，光有“大洋群”，还是不能满足需要的，还必须有“小土群”的配合，用两条腿走路，才能缓和电力紧张的局面。东北地区“小土群”的办电方法，应当在全国继续推广，让它起更大的作用。电力工业建设中需要以“大洋群”为主干，这是很容易理解的。但是城市和工业用电也可以用“小土群”，办电也可以用“土”办法，却不是容易为人们接受的。有些人也许觉得这是在开倒车。不错，从现象上看，我们似乎是在“开倒车”；但是从本质上看，我们是在和时间赛跑，赶到前面去。去年东北地区包括沈阳、旅大、鞍山这样的大工业城市，共办了“小土群”电站约三十多万瓩，旅大一市即办了十三万瓩，在这方面提供了丰富的经验。这些经验证明：办电可以大搞群众运动。只要群众一发动起来，不但速度加快，而且办法很多；一切可以利用的动力资源都被动员出来，一切可以找到的残旧设备都物尽其用。“小土群”容易办起来，就是由于具有“小”与“土”的特点。在目前情况下，一般说，“小”是指发电能力在二、三百瓩以下：“土”是指设备、材料尽量少用国家调拨的钢材、矽钢片等特殊材料，尽量以土造的代替。当然，这样小的、土的电站，一般不能适应大生产的需要，但是对解决照明和带动中、小型机器，还是很起作用的。同时，所谓“小”与“土”，其内容与形式是因时因地变化的，可以逐步向高级的阶段发展。在技术上经过不断的巩固和提高之后，“小土群”逐渐向“小洋群”发展，它的作用就会更大。
    总之，东北的事实生动地说明：第一，“小土群”的办电运动是同广大群众发展生产的迫切需要相结合的，对缓和目前电力紧张有很大的现实意义。第二，小电站和土电站并非只宜于农村和中小城镇，在工业城市和先进厂矿中也是可以建设的。第三，以小、土为主的全民办电运动，可以促进群众性的技术革命，土洋结合，以土代洋，土中出洋，发展下去，就可以加速全国电气化的提前实现，并为今后现代化的大型的电力建设准备了群众性的基础。各地都应运用东北的经验，开展群众办电运动，土洋并举，早早用两条腿走路。
    一方面，努力办好“大洋群”；一方面，全力发动“小土群”。只要这样，我们就一定能逐步解决电力紧张的问题，电力就一定能赶上前去。
