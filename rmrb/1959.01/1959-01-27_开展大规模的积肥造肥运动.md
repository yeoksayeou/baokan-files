Launch a large-scale manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign – this is the urgent task of current rural work and the key to striving for a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959. In order to mobilize all forces and do this work well, it is necessary to implement "fertilizer in command," get everyone involved, work hard and skillfully, and accumulate and produce more and better fertilizers. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed that the national grain output in 1959 should reach 1,050 billion jin, an increase of nearly two times compared with the year before last and about 40% compared with last year; the national cotton output should reach 100 million dan, an increase of more than two times compared with the year before last and nearly 50% compared with last year. This is an arduous and great goal. To achieve this goal, we must continue to fight hard and carry out a series of important battles from various aspects. The major battle that is currently unfolding, and which will play an extremely important role in the final victory of the overall situation, is the concentrated manure accumulation and fertilizer production effort. This is the key to ensuring a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil crops, hemp, and other crops.

Crops need fertilization, just as people need to eat; the more people there are, the more food is needed. This year, the land has generally been plowed deeper than last year, and the sowing is denser than last year, and the area of dense planting is even larger, which requires more fertilizer. In particular, the increased degree of dense planting requires more fertilizer. In the past, each mu of wheat was generally sown with only a dozen jin, and in some places even less than ten jin. Last autumn, the wheat sown in various places was generally denser, with generally about thirty jin sown per mu. The large-area, high-yield fields in various places (generally accounting for 10% to 20% of the wheat fields; some counties reaching more than 50%) had a sowing amount of more than forty jin per mu. This year's spring-sown crops will also be sown more densely than in the past. If fertilizer is not increased accordingly after deep plowing and dense planting, the purpose of increasing production cannot be achieved; if it is not done well, it may even reduce production; if fertilizer and other measures can be coordinated, rational dense planting can greatly increase production. Therefore, a large amount of fertilizer is urgently needed at present. Last year's bumper harvest was closely related to the large amount of fertilizer accumulated from the previous winter to spring; to achieve an even greater bumper harvest this year, we need more and better fertilizer than last year.

Can such a large task of manure accumulation and fertilizer production be completed in time? We believe that it can definitely be completed. This year, there is a most important favorable condition, that is, the widespread establishment of people's communes in rural areas across the country, which allows manpower and materials to be arranged and dispatched more rationally and can play a greater role. At the same time, due to last year's unprecedented bumper harvest, there has also been a large increase in the amount of straw, leaves, etc. available for manure accumulation, and the number of livestock has also increased. In addition, there is a very favorable condition, which is the accumulation of very rich experience in manure accumulation and fertilizer production during last year's Great Leap Forward. Fully utilizing and promoting this experience will enable us to obtain more and better fertilizer. Of course, there are also difficulties. In the future, we must vigorously develop diversified operations, and labor cannot be used in an excessively concentrated manner; last year, a lot of old walls, broken houses, kang platforms, and stove soil were used, and this year there will be less fertilizer source in this regard. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable. Giving full play to the role of favorable conditions will not only overcome the existing difficulties, but also make the achievements in manure accumulation and fertilizer production greatly exceed last year.

The main tasks of current agricultural production are: first, manure accumulation; second, field management; and third, sideline production. The latter two things can and must be done around the central task of manure accumulation. Field management is mainly topdressing, and it cannot be done well without enough fertilizer. Many projects of sideline production are closely related to manure accumulation: the construction of pig pens, sheepfolds, chicken coops, duck sheds, etc., should take into account the convenience of manure accumulation and transportation; the use of animal power for transportation should also pay attention to preventing the loss of manure. It is entirely possible to take manure accumulation and fertilizer production as the center and drive all other tasks. In order to solve the problem of labor, we must make reasonable arrangements for various tasks. Now, some labor can be drawn from the steel and water conservancy fronts back to the agricultural front, which provides better conditions for a large-scale manure accumulation movement, and can better implement the combination of professional teams for manure accumulation and everyone's manure accumulation. On the one hand, relatively sufficient forces should be drawn (generally speaking, in winter, this can account for half of the labor force in the commune specializing in agricultural production, that is, more than 25% of the total labor force of the entire commune), and professional teams for manure accumulation and fertilizer production should be organized, who are responsible for developing relatively large sources of fertilizer, concentrating efforts to focus on manure accumulation and fertilizer production, and strengthening various basic constructions related to fertilizer. On the other hand, the commune can also assign certain tasks to people engaged in other work, so that everyone can closely combine their work with their business and cooperate in completing the task of manure accumulation and fertilizer production in a wider range, and make use of scattered and sporadic sources of fertilizer.

Improving fertilizer quality and improving manure accumulation methods are of great significance in the current situation of insufficient rural labor. It is necessary to appropriately reduce soil fertilizer and greatly increase organic fertilizer and soil-made fertilizer. It is necessary to promote advanced experiences in increasing fertilizer content and preserving fertilizer content. Promote the relocation of livestock pens, implement the three-pen (cattle pen, pig pen, sheep pen) to the field, and accumulate, compost, and smoke fertilizer in the field. At the same time, it is also necessary to reform and promote the tools for accumulating, making, transporting, and applying fertilizer, so as to greatly improve the efficiency of accumulating, making, transporting, and applying fertilizer and save a lot of labor.

The problem of insufficient fertilizer sources also does not exist. Our country is very rich in fertilizer resources. Many things can be directly applied to the land after being dug out, and many things can fertilize the fields with a little composting. As long as the masses are mobilized, there is no need to worry about the lack of fertilizer sources. Anhui folk songs sing well: "There is no trick to accumulating fertilizer, remember the ten characters: smoking, burning, digging, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, composting, piling, picking, and撈 (scooping). As long as you are willing to find it, there are many fertilizer sources; accumulate and grow, never ending." From mountain gullies to river bottoms, from plains to the sea, fertilizer can be found everywhere. The following three aspects are particularly worth noting at present:

First, accumulate human and animal manure, garbage, and compost and smoke fertilizer. To adapt to the new situation after the people's commune, and in conjunction with the patriotic health movement, the manure and garbage in public activity places should be assigned to dedicated personnel for cleaning and preservation, so as not to have any loss. Composting and smoke fertilization should also make use of the favorable conditions of collectivization and be carried out on a planned and large-scale basis in the fields; if accelerating the decomposition of fertilizer, advanced methods of high-temperature rapid composting can be adopted.

Second, mass-produce soil-made fertilizer. Some places stopped production of soil-made fertilizer after a while due to various reasons, and should quickly resume production and produce regularly. The raw materials for making soil-made fertilizer are very rich, and various places should continue to mobilize the masses to widely trial-produce on the one hand, and carefully organize scientific and technical personnel to analyze and identify on the other hand, so that the work of making soil-made fertilizer can be continuously improved on the basis of popularization. In addition to each production team and each management area running a large number of small factories, the commune and county joint cooperatives should also set up some larger factories to produce soil-made fertilizer and foreign fertilizer with higher quality.

Third, process and cultivate green manure. Green manure has a very high fertilizer efficiency, and can be directly turned under in situ, saving labor and effort. Green manure can also be used as livestock feed first, and then livestock manure can be used as fertilizer, which can kill two birds with one stone. This year, many regions did not complete the winter green manure sowing plan. Therefore, special attention should be paid to strengthening the field management of green manure and increasing the yield of fresh grass per unit area as much as possible.

Now winter crops are in need of a lot of topdressing; now the season for spring plowing and applying base fertilizer is also very imminent (about one month in the south and about two months in the north). Time is very tight and the task is very heavy; we must pay enough attention to it, we must start immediately, and launch a vigorous mass movement. Not only rural areas, but also cities and towns, government agencies, schools, and troops should be mobilized to participate in the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement. Everyone should act and offer advice, and we believe that we will definitely be able to get more and better fertilizer, laying a good foundation for this year's agricultural leap forward.

### 开展大规模的积肥造肥运动

    开展大规模的积肥造肥运动
    立即掀起一个大规模的积肥造肥运动，这是当前农村工作的紧急任务，也是争取实现1959年农业更大跃进的关键。为了动员一切力量，作好这项工作，必须实行“肥料挂帅”，人人动手，苦干巧干，积集和制造又多又好的肥料。党的八届六中全会提出：1959年全国粮食产量要达到一万零五百亿斤，比前年增加近两倍，比去年增加约40％；全国的棉花产量要达到一亿担，比前年增加两倍多，比去年也增加近50％。这是一个艰巨而伟大的目标，要达到这个目标，必须继续苦战，从多方面进行一系列重要的战斗。目前要展开的，对全局的最后胜利将要起极其重大的作用的一场大战，就是突击积肥造肥。这是保证粮食、棉花、油料、麻类等各方面大丰收的关键。
    庄稼需要施肥，正和人需要吃饭一样；人越多，需要的粮食就越多。今年土地一般都比去年深翻了，播种比去年更密而且密植的面积更大了，这就需要更多的肥料。特别是密植的程度增高，需要的肥料也就越多。过去每亩小麦一般只播种十几斤，有的地方还不到十斤。去年秋天各地播种的小麦普遍加密了，一般每亩都下种三十斤左右。各地的大面积高额丰产田（一般的占麦地的10％至20％；有些县达到50％以上），每亩下种量在四十斤以上。今年的春播作物，也要比过去种得密。深耕和密植以后如果不相应地增加肥料，就不能达到增产的目的；弄得不好甚至会减产；如果肥料和别的措施都能配合上去，合理密植就能大大增产。因此，目前迫切需要大量的肥料。去年的大丰收，同前冬去春积肥多有密切的关系；今年要得到更大的丰收，就需要有比去年更多更好的肥料。
    这样大的积肥造肥任务，能不能及时完成呢？我们相信，一定能够完成。今年有一个最重要的有利条件，就是全国农村普遍成立了人民公社，人力物力能够更合理地安排和调度，能发挥更大的作用。同时，由于去年空前大丰收，可供积肥之用的秸秆、叶子等等也增加了很多，家畜也增加了。此外，还有一个十分有利的条件，这就是在去年大跃进中积累了十分丰富的积肥造肥的经验，充分运用和推广这些经验，就能够得到更多更好的肥料。当然，困难也是有的。今后要大力开展多种经营，劳动力不能过分集中使用；去年把很多陈墙破屋炕台灶土已经使用了，今年这方面的肥源就少了。可是，这些困难并不是不可克服的。充分发挥有利条件的作用，就不仅能够克服现有的困难，而且能够使积肥造肥的成绩大大超过去年。
    当前农业生产的主要工作，一是积肥，一是田间管理，一是副业生产。后两件事情，都可以而且必须围绕着积肥这个中心工作来做。田间管理主要是追肥，没有足够的肥料就做不好。副业生产的很多项目和积肥有密切关系：猪圈、羊圈、鸡窝、鸭棚等等的修建，要考虑到积肥运肥的方便；利用畜力从事运输的，也要注意不使粪肥流失。以积肥造肥为中心，把其他各项工作都带动起来，是完全可以做到的。为了要解决劳动力的问题，必须对各项工作进行合理安排。现在，可以从钢铁、水利等战线抽调一部分劳动力回到农业战线上来，大搞积肥运动就有了更好的条件，就可以更好地实行专业队积肥和人人积肥相结合。一方面，抽出比较充足的力量（一般地说，在冬季可以占公社里专门从事农业生产的劳动力的一半，也就是说，占全社劳动力总数的25％以上），组织积肥造肥专业队，由他们负责开发比较大宗的肥源，集中力量突击积肥造肥，并加强有关肥料的各项基本建设。另一方面，公社里还可以给从事其他工作的人也都分配一定的任务，让大家同自己的业务密切结合，在更广泛的范围内配合完成积肥造肥任务，把分散的零星的肥源都利用起来。
    提高肥料质量和改进积肥方法这在目前农村劳动力不足的情况下有十分重要的意义。要适当减少土肥，大量增加有机肥料和土化肥。要推广增加肥分和保存肥分的先进经验。推广畜圈搬家，实行三圈（牛圈、猪圈、羊圈）到田，在田头积肥、沤肥和熏肥。同时，还要改革和推广积肥、造肥、运肥、施肥的工具，以大大提高积肥、造肥、运肥、施肥的效率，节约大量的劳动力。
    肥源不足的问题也是不存在的。我国肥料资源丰富得很，有好多东西挖出来就可以直接上地，有好多东西稍加堆制就能肥田。只要把群众发动起来，就不愁没有肥源。安徽民歌唱得好：“积肥没有巧，十字要记牢：熏、烧、挖、换、扫、铲、沤、堆、拾、捞。只要肯去找，肥源真不少；边积边又生，永远完不了。”从山沟到河底，从平地到大海，哪里都能找出肥料来。目前特别值得注意的有以下三个方面：
    一是积攒人畜粪便、垃圾和沤肥、熏肥。要适应人民公社化以后的新情况，并结合爱国卫生运动，把公共活动场所的粪便、垃圾、草木灰分给专人负责打扫和保存，不使有一点损失。沤肥、熏肥也要运用公社化的有利条件，有计划地大规模地在田间进行；如加速肥料的腐熟，可以采用高温快速堆肥的先进方法。
    二是大量制造土化肥。有些地方搞了一阵土化肥生产之后，由于种种原因停工了，应当赶快恢复起来，经常生产。制造土化肥的原料很丰富，各地应该一方面继续发动群众广泛试制，一方面认真组织科学技术人员分析鉴定，使土化肥的制造工作在普及的基础上不断提高。除了各生产队、各管理区大量办一些小型厂之外，公社和县联社还应该设一些较大的厂，生产质量较高一些的土化肥和洋化肥。
    三是加工培育绿肥。绿肥肥效很高，而且可以就地翻压，省工省力。绿肥又可以先用来作牲畜饲料，然后用牲畜粪作肥料，可以一举两得。今年不少地区冬季绿肥播种计划没有完成。因此要特别注意加强对绿肥的田间管理，尽可能提高单位面积鲜草的产量。
    现在过冬作物正需要大量追肥；现在离春耕施底肥的季节，也已经很迫近了（南方约一个月，北方约两个月）。时间非常紧迫，任务非常重大；必须足够重视，必须立即动手，发动一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，不但农村，而且城镇、机关、学校、部队都应当动员起来，一起参加积肥造肥运动。人人动手，个个献计，我们相信，一定能够搞到更多更好的肥料，为今年农业大跃进打下一个良好的基础。
