Condemning the Kishi Nobusuke Government for Obstructing the Repatriation of Korean Residents
By a Commentator of This Newspaper
Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on December 30, 1958, condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government's obstruction of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan and once again strongly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government take practical measures to enable Korean residents in Japan to return to their homeland. The Kishi Nobusuke government's unreasonable obstruction of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan not only infringes upon the legitimate rights of hundreds of thousands of Korean citizens in Japan and demonstrates an extremely unfriendly attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also crudely violates international law and humanitarian principles. The Chinese people fully support Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement and believe that the Kishi Nobusuke government should immediately take effective measures to allow Korean residents in Japan to realize their legitimate desire to return to their homeland.

The Japanese government has always discriminated against Korean citizens residing in Japan with respect to the various rights that foreigners should enjoy. Most of these Korean residents are often in a state of unemployment and discrimination, and some have even committed suicide because they cannot maintain their lives. Many Korean youths cannot enjoy the right to receive democratic national education and do not have the opportunity to further their education. In order to promote the "Japan-Korea talks" directed by U.S. imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government has more than once violated the will of Korean residents and forcibly deported Korean citizens illegally detained in Japanese detention centers to South Korea. It is quite natural that Korean residents in Japan, in order to get rid of their unfortunate situation, are eager to return to the embrace of their motherland. The recent repatriation movement launched by Korean residents in various parts of Japan, with hundreds of thousands of Korean residents prepared to return home collectively, is enough to show that they have reached the point of being unable to tolerate the discriminatory and persecutory behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in order to safeguard the legitimate rights of Korean citizens residing in Japan and to satisfy their reasonable desire to return to their homeland, clarified its position on the issue of the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan in a statement issued as early as September 16 last year. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea emphasized in the statement at that time that Korean citizens who have lost their means of livelihood in Japan have the full right to return to their homeland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—to live a happy life, and no one can infringe upon their legitimate right. The statement also requested the Japanese government to cooperate and allow these Korean residents to return to their homeland as soon as possible. Recently, the Korean government has made preparations for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, including solving transportation and travel expenses. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government completely ignored the legitimate desire of Korean residents in Japan to return home and the efforts made by the Korean government; although it verbally acknowledged that this was a "humanitarian issue," it was actually engaging in inhumane actions, making every effort to obstruct Korean residents from returning to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama even openly stated that the issue of Korean residents returning home should be resolved politically in the "Korea-Japan talks." This means that the Japanese government wants to detain Korean residents as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with the Syngman Rhee clique for "normalization of relations." In order to realize this despicable attempt, the Kishi Nobusuke government even mobilized the police to threaten and intimidate those Korean residents who wished to return home.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's unreasonable attitude, which completely violates humanitarian principles and international law, has aroused the anger of the entire Korean people and the condemnation of all righteous people. Even in Japan, this perverse act of the Kishi Nobusuke government is unpopular. The majority of Japanese people sympathize with the plight of Korean residents in Japan, and they are actively supporting the movement of Korean residents demanding repatriation. According to a spokesman for the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, as of December 23 last year, 112 prefectural, city councils, and mayoral associations in Japan had passed resolutions supporting the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. It can be predicted that if the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its unreasonable practice of obstructing the repatriation of Korean residents, it will surely further arouse the strong condemnation of the people of Korea and Japan and the righteous public opinion of the world!

    谴责岸信介政府阻挠朝鲜侨民回国
    本报评论员
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日于1958年12月30日发表声明，谴责岸信介政府妨碍旅日朝鲜侨民回国的行为，并再一次强硬要求岸信介政府采取实际措施，使在日本的朝鲜侨民得以返回自己的祖国。岸信介政府无理阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回国，不仅侵犯了在日本的几十万朝鲜公民的正当权利，表现了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国极不友好的态度，而且粗暴地违反了国际法和人道主义原则。中国人民完全支持南日外务相的声明，认为岸信介政府应立即采取有效措施，让旅日朝鲜侨民实现他们返回祖国的正当愿望。
    日本政府一向歧视居住在日本的朝鲜公民作为外侨应享有的各项权利。这些朝鲜侨民大多数经常处于失业和被歧视的地位，有人甚至由于无法维持生活而自杀。许多朝鲜青少年不能享有接受民主的民族教育的权利，得不到升学机会。岸信介政府为了促进由美帝国主义一手导演的“日韩会谈”，曾不止一次地违反朝鲜侨民的意志，把被非法扣留在日本收容所的朝鲜公民，强迫遣送到南朝鲜去。旅日朝鲜侨民为了摆脱他们这种不幸的处境，迫切要求返回自己祖国的怀抱，是十分自然的事情。最近，日本各地的朝鲜侨民发起的回国运动，数十万朝鲜侨民作好了集体回国的准备，就足以说明他们对于岸信介政府的歧视和迫害行为，已经到了不能忍受的地步。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为了维护侨居日本的朝鲜公民的正当权利，为了满足他们返回祖国的合理愿望，早在去年9月16日发表的声明中就阐明了对旅日朝鲜侨民回国问题的立场。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府当时在声明中强调指出，在日本失去生活之路的朝鲜公民，完全有权利返回自己的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国过幸福的生活，任何人都不能侵犯他们的这一正当权利。这个声明并且要求日本政府给予合作，让这些朝鲜侨民早日返回自己的祖国。最近，朝鲜政府更作好了使旅日朝鲜侨民回国的准备工作，其中包括解决运输问题和旅费问题在内。然而，岸信介政府根本无视旅日朝鲜侨民回国的正当愿望和朝鲜政府所作的这种努力；它虽然口头上承认这是“人道问题”，实际上却干着违反人道的行动，竭力阻挠朝鲜侨民返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。日本外务相藤山爱一郎甚至公然表示：朝鲜侨民回国问题，应该在“韩日会谈”中从政治上来解决。这就是说，日本政府想把朝鲜侨民扣留下来，作为他们同李承晚集团谈判“关系正常化”的讨价还价的资本。为了实现这种卑劣的企图，岸信介政府甚至动员了警察来威胁和恐吓那些希望回国的朝鲜侨民。
    岸信介政府的这种完全违反人道原则和国际法的无理态度，激起了全体朝鲜人民的愤怒和一切正义人士的谴责。就是在日本，岸信介政府这种倒行逆施也是不得人心的。日本大多数人对旅日朝鲜侨民的处境是同情的，他们正积极支援朝鲜侨民要求回国的运动。据旅日朝鲜人总联合会发言人宣布，截至去年12月23日为止，日本已有一百十二个县、市议会和市长会等通过了决议，支持旅日朝鲜侨民回国。可以预计，如果岸信介政府不改变它这种阻挠旅日侨民回国的无理作法，就一定会更加激起朝日两国人民和全世界正义舆论的强烈谴责！
