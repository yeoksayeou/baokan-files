Naval Motorboat Rescues Fishermen in Stormy Seas
　　Xue Yanliang
On December 30th of last year, the Sailor's Club in Lushunkou was festively decorated, and people were happily preparing to celebrate the New Year.

At 2:00 PM, two cadres from a suburban people's commune hurriedly arrived at the duty room of the military command headquarters, requesting a boat be dispatched to rescue nine fishermen who had been swept out to sea by a strong wind. It turned out that in the morning, when the sea was calm, three fishermen had gone out to sea in a small sampan to plant seaweed. At noon, a sudden gale roared across the sea, accompanied by heavy snowfall. The sampan was blown towards the open sea, and two sampans sent by the commune for rescue were also blown out to sea. For the nine fishermen, every minute of delay meant more danger. To save time, the command headquarters dispatched a certain escort boat that was on duty. For an escort boat to navigate in a force 8 gale far exceeded its wind resistance capacity. The boat's captain, Chen Gui, knowing that saving the fishermen's lives was paramount, resolutely assured the higher authorities and leaders that he would complete the mission and bring the fishermen back!

The escort boat quickly left the dock and sped towards the sea at high speed. The gale whipped up snowflakes and fierce waves, violently hitting the boat head-on, causing everyone's face to sting like needles. To save every second to rescue the fishermen, Captain Chen Gui and Deputy Captain Wang Ruilin did not even have time to put on their sea suits before setting sail. Several large waves soaked their thin clothes, but they remained standing on the bridge, staring ahead without blinking. Finally, they spotted two sampans and six fishermen on the sea. After the fishermen were rescued and the sampans were anchored, they went to search for the other sampan.

At this time, the wind was stronger and the waves were higher, and the boat was rocking so violently that its hull was exposed. Some comrades used to get seasick in force 4 waves, but now in a force 8 gale, everyone was energetic and focused on watching the sea. After more than ten minutes of searching, they finally found the distressed sampan and fishermen. The sampan was already filled with a lot of seawater at this time, and the oar had been broken by the wind and waves. The three people on board were soaked, at the mercy of the wind and waves. When they saw these brave sailors, they waved desperately while standing on the sampan.

The fishermen were rescued onto the escort boat, but the sampan's rope was not brought along. At this time, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the sampan was dancing on the crests of the waves. The sampan was the property of the people's commune, and it had to be towed back no matter what. Engine soldier Yu Ende jumped onto the sampan without hesitation, but the sampan happened to fall with the wave, and Yu Ende fell into the roaring sea. The two commune cadres who had come along with the boat immediately took off their clothes and prepared to jump into the sea to save him. Although Deputy Captain Wang Ruilin was very anxious, he thought: we are here to save the fishermen, and we must not allow the commune cadres to be in danger again, so he grabbed the commune cadres. Seeing this critical situation, Captain Chen Gui immediately used a pole to turn the sampan around, and Yu Ende took the opportunity to grab the sampan and turn to the outer side, but the rope on the sampan entangled his leg, and he couldn't climb up. Engine Squad Leader Miao Huaxiang, service soldier Zhang Xiaozeng, and signal soldier Liang Chengzong quickly took off their clothes and jumped onto the sampan to save Yu Ende. Yu Ende was rescued, and the sampan was also brought back.

After more than two hours of fighting, the sky gradually darkened. The escort boat sailed back against the biting north wind. The deck and railings were covered with a layer of ice, and people's hands, noses, and eyebrows were also covered with a layer of frost. At this time, a thick fog rose on the sea, and the boat had to feel its way back. When they heard the sound of the harbor foghorn, they revealed a joyful smile of victory.

    怒海飞艇救渔民
    雪雁亮
    去年12月30日，旅顺口的水兵俱乐部张灯结采，人们欢天喜地地准备欢度新年。
    下午两点钟，郊区人民公社的两个干部，急急忙忙地来到了部队司令部门的值班室，要求派船去抢救被大风刮到海里去的九个渔民。原来在上午风平浪静的时候，有三个渔民乘小舢舨下海去种海带。中午，海上骤然狂风呼啸，大雪纷飞。舢舨被刮向外海，公社派去抢救的两条舢舨也被刮到海上去了。九个渔民的生命，晚去一分钟，就多一分危险。为了抢时间，司令部门派了正在值班的某护卫艇去。一只护卫艇在八级大风中航行，大大超越了它的抗风能力。艇长陈贵想到抢救渔民的生命要紧，他便坚毅地向上级机关和首长表示，保证完成任务，把渔民救回来！
    护卫艇迅速离开了码头，高速度向大海驶去。狂风卷起雪花猛浪，猛烈地迎面扑来，每个人的脸像针扎一样的痛。艇长陈贵和副艇长王瑞林，为了争取分秒时间抢救渔民，出航时连出海服都没来得及穿，几个大浪就把他们单薄的衣服打湿透了，可是他们一直站在驾驶台上，眼睛一眨不眨地盯着前方，终于在海面上发现了两只舢舨和六个渔民。渔民被救上来了，舢舨也下了锚，然后又去寻找另一只舢舨。
    这时，风更大浪更高了，艇摇晃得连艇底都露出来了。过去有的同志遇上四级风浪就晕船，这回在八级大风中，个个都神志焕发，聚精会神地注视着海面。经过十多分钟的搜索，终于找到了遇险的舢舨和渔民。这只舢舨这时已经灌进去很多海水，橹也被风浪打断了，船上的三个人衣服湿透了，在任凭风浪摆布。当他们看到这些勇敢的水兵的时候，不顾一切地站在舢舨上招手。
    渔民被救上护卫艇，却没有把舢舨的缆绳带上来。这时风大浪高，舢舨像是在浪峰上跳舞一样。舢舨是人民公社的财产，无论如何也要把它拖回去。轮机兵于恩德毫不犹豫地向舢舨上跳去，那知舢舨正好随浪跌下去，于恩德一下子落到怒吼的大海里去了。随艇前来的两位公社干部立即脱衣服准备跳海救人。副艇长王瑞林虽然心里非常着急，但想到：我们是来救渔民的，绝不能叫公社的干部再发生危险，就一把拉住了公社的干部。艇长陈贵看到这一危急情况，立即用撑杆把舢舨掉了一个转，于恩德乘机拉住舢舨转到外舷去了，可是舢舨上的绳子缠住了他的腿，怎么也爬不上来。轮机班长苗华祥、服务兵张孝曾和信号兵梁成忠，急忙脱掉衣服，跳到舢舨上救于恩德。于恩德脱险了，舢舨也带回来了。
    经过两个多钟头的搏斗，天慢慢暗下来。这只护卫艇迎着凛冽的北风返航了。甲板上、栏杆上都结了一层冰，人们的手上、鼻子上、眉毛上也都盖了一层冰霜。这时候海上又起了大雾，艇只好摸索着返航。当他们听到了港口雾笛的叫声时，才露出胜利的喜悦。
