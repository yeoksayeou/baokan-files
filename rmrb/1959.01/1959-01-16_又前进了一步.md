	Taking Another Step Forward

	This year's water conservancy construction is vigorously promoting technological innovation to increase work efficiency. The comrades of the Advanced Tool Trial Production Group of the Anhui Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau have given play to their innovative spirit and organized the collaboration of various water control tools, raising the work of tool reform a step further, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of water control work. This is indeed a very noteworthy thing. We hope that this experience can be promoted.

	In the course of their work, this trial production group conducted a detailed analysis of the performance of different tools and the characteristics of different projects. From the analysis, they found connections and improved the creations of the masses. This spirit of scientific analysis, going deep into reality, is particularly worthy of praise.

    又前进了一步
    今年的水利建设，大力提倡革新技术，提高工效。安徽省农田水利局先进工具试制组的同志发挥独创精神，组织了多种治水工具的协作，把工具改革工作提高了一步，从而使治水工效大大提高。这实在是很引人注意的事。我们希望这个经验能够得到推广。
    这个试制组在工作中间，对不同工具的性能和不同工程的特点，进行了细致的分析，从分析中找出联系，把群众的创造加以提高，这种深入实际的科学分析精神，特别值得赞扬。
