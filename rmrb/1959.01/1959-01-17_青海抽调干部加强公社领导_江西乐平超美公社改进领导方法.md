Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 16th: The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently transferred over one hundred cadres at the county-level Party Secretary level from provincial, prefectural, and county-level organizations to serve as Party Committee Secretaries or other leadership positions in over one hundred and ninety people's communes throughout the province, in order to strengthen the leadership of the people's communes. The Provincial Committee plans to initially assign one county-level Party Secretary to each people's commune, and gradually increase the number to four to five. At the same time, seven department and bureau director-level cadres were transferred from provincial-level organizations to serve in leadership positions in prefectures and counties. The transferred cadres have successively arrived at their work posts.

This newspaper, Nanchang, January 16th: The Chaomei People's Commune in Leping County, Jiangxi Province, based on its experience in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, is actively improving its leadership methods, training cadres, and strengthening the leadership of the commune, in order to adapt to the commune's comprehensive development of production and ensure the realization of a greater leap forward in 1959.

In the previous period, the Chaomei Commune Party Committee organized all commune cadres to start with summarizing experiences and discuss how to strengthen the leadership of the commune. According to the practice in the previous stage, all cadres believed that the method of assigning cadres to brigades, factories, and mines concurrently adopted by the commune in the past could strengthen the cadres' sense of responsibility and spirit of inquiry, which was beneficial to strengthening the leadership of the work of a team and a factory; however, due to the inconsistency in leadership levels, this method often led to an imbalance in work progress. In addition, the commune had few cadres and the scale of the commune was large, and the conditions for universally applying this method were insufficient. After listening to these experiences and opinions, the Commune Party Committee took the following measures to strengthen the centralized leadership of the commune and the leadership of the production front line: First, the original departments were merged into four departments: agriculture, industry, finance and trade, and culture, education, and health, each headed by the main cadres of the commune, in order to strengthen centralized and unified leadership; at the same time, six Party committee members were transferred to the production brigades and key factories and mines in remote areas with scattered units and weak leadership to serve as full-time branch secretaries, strengthening the leadership there. Second, the commune retained one director and clerks and accountants to handle daily work, and assisted one production brigade in the local area, while all other cadres in each department were unified into three working groups, taking the original three small townships as units, respectively contracting to assist the work of ten production brigades, and stipulating that each group regularly return to each department to study, arrange, and check the business work of its own department, so as to combine the points and the surface; at the same time, it was emphasized that each department should obey the unified leadership and arrangement of the commune, and each department should cooperate well with each other. Third, in order to facilitate the masses, offices were set up in the Taqian and Xiaxu brigades, which were far from the commune, to entrust them with handling some specific issues in the lives of the local masses. In this way, the leadership of the production front line was strengthened, the overall work of the commune was unified, the centralized leadership was strengthened, and the problem of insufficient cadres for the universal implementation of decentralized management was also solved. Doing so has made the masses even more satisfied.

The Chaomei Commune has also taken some effective measures to improve the level of existing cadres. The main methods are: First, calling on all walks of life to plant "experimental plots." Cadres explore experience through planting experimental plots to become familiar with production and lead production. Second, strengthen the education and assistance to cadres with lower levels, and assign cadres with stronger abilities to tutor them in the method of masters leading apprentices. Third, formulate a learning system to urge cadres to strengthen learning and improve their political and ideological levels.

In order to expand the ranks of cadres and meet the needs of the commune to strengthen leadership, the Commune Party Committee also consciously focused on cultivating outstanding elements with better thinking and the trust of the masses, and after a period of testing and then through mass selection, they were absorbed into the ranks of cadres.

After further strengthening the leadership of the commune at all levels, the Chaomei Commune showed many new atmospheres, and there were even greater leaps forward in production, work, and ideology.

    青海抽调干部加强公社领导
    江西乐平超美公社改进领导方法
    据新华社西宁16日电　中共青海省委最近从省、州、县级机关抽调一百多名县委书记级的干部，下放到全省一百九十多个人民公社中担任党委书记或其他领导工作，以加强人民公社的领导。省委计划第一步每个人民公社先配备一个县委书记级的干部，以后逐步增加到四个至五个。同时，并从省级机关抽调了七名部、厅长级的干部担任州、县领导工作。被抽调的干部已经先后到达工作岗位。
    本报南昌16日电　江西省乐平县超美人民公社在总结1958年大跃进经验的基础上，积极改进领导方法，训练干部，加强公社的领导，以适应公社全面发展生产的要求，保证实现1959年更大的跃进。
    中共超美公社党委在前一时期组织全社干部从总结经验入手，讨论了如何加强公社的领导问题。全体干部根据前一阶段的实践，认为过去公社采取将干部分到大队、厂矿兼职的分兵把口的方法，能加强干部的责任心与钻研精神，对加强一个队一个厂的工作领导有好处；可是，由于领导水平不一致，运用这种方法往往出现工作进展不平衡的局面。另外公社干部少，社的规模又大，普遍运用这种方法的条件也不够。公社党委在听取了这些经验和意见之后，对加强公社的集中领导及生产第一线的领导，采取了如下措施：第一、将原有的科室合并为农业、工业、财经贸易、文教卫生等四个部，各部由公社主要干部负责，以加强集中统一的领导；同时，抽调出六个党委委员下放到地区偏僻、单位分散、领导较弱的生产大队和重点厂矿专任支部书记，加强那里的领导。第二、公社留一个社长及文书、会计员处理日常工作，并负责协助所在地的一个生产大队工作，其余所有各部干部统一组成三个工作组，以原来三个小乡为单位，分别包干协助十个生产大队的工作，并规定各组定期回各部研究布置和检查本部门的业务工作，做到点面结合；同时强调各部服从公社的统一领导和安排，部与部之间搞好协作。第三、为了便利群众，在距离公社较远的塔前、下徐两个大队设立了办事处，委托处理当地群众生活中的一些具体问题。这样，生产第一线的领导加强了，公社全盘工作统一了步调，加强了集中领导，也解决了普遍实行分兵把口干部不足的问题。这样做，群众更加满意。
    超美公社还采取了一些有效办法，来提高现有干部的水平。主要办法：一、号召各行各业都种“试验田”。干部通过种试验田摸索经验，以熟悉生产领导生产。二、加强对水平较低的干部的教育和帮助，以师傅带徒弟的方法指定能力较强的干部做辅导。三、制订学习制度，督促干部加强学习，提高政策思想水平。
    为了扩大干部队伍，满足公社加强领导的需要，公社党委还有意识地对思想较好、群众信任的优秀分子进行了重点培养，经过一个时期考验再经过群众选拔吸收到干部队伍中来。
    超美公社进一步加强了公社的各级领导后，出现了许多新气象，生产、工作、思想样样都有了更大的跃进。
