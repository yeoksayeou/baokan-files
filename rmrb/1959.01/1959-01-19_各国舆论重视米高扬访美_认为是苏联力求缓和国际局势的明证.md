　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Worldwide public opinion is closely watching the unofficial visit of Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan to the United States, and believes that this is evidence of the Soviet Union's sincere hope for a peaceful resolution of international disputes and its efforts to ease international tensions.

    The editorial in the latest issue of the Soviet magazine "New Times" emphasizes that the reception Mikoyan received and the American press's reaction to his visit prove that the broad masses of the American people are willing to peacefully adjust existing differences between the Soviet Union and the United States and establish a more normal atmosphere in the relations between the two countries. The editorial, in discussing Mikoyan's meetings with American activists, points out that American social figures believe that this direct contact is of great significance. Many observers hope that this contact will be able to make important contributions to resolving those pressing international issues.

    American newspapers have widely reported and commented on Mikoyan's visit. The "New York Herald Tribune," in talking about the impression Mikoyan's visit to the United States has given people, wrote, "Senior American officials apparently believe that they can smell a relaxation of the international atmosphere." "New York Times" reporter Jordan wrote, "His (Mikoyan's) meeting with the Vice President and earlier talks with labor leaders have made it more believable here that the Russians are very willing to conduct serious negotiations with the United States." The "New York Times," in another article entitled "Soviet Guest Leaves a Deep Impression Here," said: "Mikoyan came to the Pacific coast on a mission of goodwill." "He preaches peace anytime, anywhere. Mikoyan's words reached every American. He said: Let us argue, discuss, let us compete, but let's not fight." The article emphasizes: "What Mikoyan said is by no means just clichés about maintaining good relations. He expounded the consistent position on US-Soviet relations." The New York "Daily News" also said in an editorial: "Mikoyan's visit and talks may well be regarded in the future as a stage on the road to easing Cold War tensions, and the beginning of an era in US-Soviet relations based on the principle of 'live and let live'."

    While some American commentators and reporters pointed out that Mikoyan's visit to the United States is very likely to lay the foundation for mutual understanding and improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, they criticized American officials for not fully utilizing this possibility. "Washington Post and Times Herald" commentator Roberts called the US government's policy on the issue of Soviet leaders visiting the US a "two-faced" policy. He wrote that on the one hand, the government hopes to increase mutual visits with Soviet leaders; but on the other hand, it is somewhat afraid that these leaders may in some way soften the American public's attitude in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

    Mikoyan's visit to the United States has become the focus of attention for Canadian newspapers. The "Real Estate Owner-Daily Banner" published in Cornwall, in an editorial, pointed out that Mikoyan's call for peaceful coexistence and his statement that the Soviet Union is willing to develop trade with the United States and other Western countries are supported by members of Western society who believe that this is completely acceptable. The "Banner" said that Mikoyan's visit will promote the convening of a summit conference. The "Winnipeg Free Press" said that regardless of the situation during the meeting at the White House, Mikoyan's visit has ultimately brought benefits. The "Vancouver Sun" called on the United States to approach the Soviet Union and abandon its hostile attitude.

    Newspapers in Latin American countries widely commented on Mikoyan's visit to the United States. The Uruguayan "El Popular" published an editorial pointing out that Mikoyan's visit to the United States is "another manifestation of the Soviet government's peace policy." Many Argentine newspapers believe that Mikoyan's talks with American leaders will help strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries and weaken the Cold War. The weekly "Propósitos" said that trade between the Soviet Union and the United States may be expanded.

    British newspapers closely followed Mikoyan's visit to the United States. "Daily Mail" Washington correspondent Broadbent wrote: "From an international point of view, Mikoyan's trip is of no small significance." The "Daily Express" also believes that Mikoyan's private meetings with American business leaders prove that there are broad possibilities for cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in all aspects. "Daily Express" New York correspondent Lower wrote that New York observers are convinced that there is a growing sense of clear dissatisfaction with Dulles, and it is now clearly time to change the "brinkmanship" policy pursued by Dulles.

    Indian newspapers also warmly commented on Mikoyan's visit to the United States. The "Assam Tribune's" commentary pointed out that a high-level conference attended by the heads of government of the major powers must be held. The newspaper wrote:
  "If bilateral talks are held between the heads of government of the United States and the Soviet Union before holding such a conference, the success of this conference will be largely guaranteed." The "Sunday Tribune" pointed out that Mikoyan's visit to the United States "has aroused unusual interest in the world." This newspaper wrote: "In a world filled with the horror of war caused by the existence of nuclear weapons, there is no more noble task than guaranteeing peace. Therefore, all possibilities for achieving international mutual understanding must be studied."

    The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial pointing out that Mikoyan's visit to the United States and the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a German peace conference are of great significance. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that it expects Western countries to take advantage of Mikoyan's visit to the United States and the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a German peace conference to improve relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The editorial believes that this will help peace.

    各国舆论重视米高扬访美
    认为是苏联力求缓和国际局势的明证
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，全世界的舆论密切注视着苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬在美国进行的非正式访问，并且认为这是苏联真诚希望和平解决国际争端和力求缓和国际紧张局势的明证。
    最近一期的苏联“新时代”杂志的社论中着重指出，米高扬所受的接待和美国报刊对他的访问的反应证明，美国的广大人士愿意和平地调整苏美现有分歧，在两国关系中建立起更正常的气氛。社论在谈到米高扬和美国活动家的会见时指出，美国社会人士认为这种直接接触意义很大。许多观察家希望，这种接触对解决那些迫不及待的国际问题将能够做出重要的贡献。
    美国报纸广泛地报道和评论米高扬的访问。“纽约先驱论坛报”在谈到米高扬在美国访问给人们的印象时写道，“美国高级官方人士显然认为，可以嗅到一种缓和国际气氛的味道”。“纽约时报”记者约旦写道，“他（米高扬）同副总统的会见以及早些时候同工会领袖进行的谈话，使这里更加相信，俄国人很愿意同美国进行认真的谈判。”“纽约时报”在另一篇以“苏联客人在这里留下了深刻的印象”为题发表的文章说：“米高扬负着亲善的使命来到太平洋岸。”“他随时随地到处宣扬和平。米高扬所讲的话达到了每个美国人那里。他说：让我们来争辩、讨论，让我们来竞赛吧，但是不要打仗。”文章着重指出：“米高扬所讲的话，决不只是谈保持良好关系的陈腔滥调。他阐述了美苏关系的一贯立场。”纽约“新闻日报”在一篇社论中也说：“米高扬的访问和谈话在将来完全可能被认为是缓和冷战紧张局势道路上的某个阶段，也是美苏关系中‘你活，也让别人活’为原则的时期的开始。”
    一部分美国评论员和记者在指出米高扬访问美国有很大可能奠定苏美两国之间的相互谅解和改善关系的同时，对于美国官方人士没有充分利用这种可能性提出了批评。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”评论员罗伯茨把美国政府在关于苏联领袖访问美国问题上的政策称之为“两面”政策。他写道，一方面，政府希望增加同苏联领袖们的相互访问；但另一方面，它又有些害怕这些领袖可能会以某种方式软化美国公众在同苏联的冷战中的态度。
    米高扬对美国的访问已成为加拿大报刊注意的中心。柯恩瓦尔出版的“不动产所有者—每日旗帜报”在社论中指出，米高扬呼吁和平共处和声明苏联愿意同美国及其他西方国家发展贸易，这些话受到西方国家社会人士的支持，他们认为这是完全可以接受的。“旗帜报”说，米高扬的访问将会促进高级会议的召开。“温尼伯自由新闻”说，不管在白宫会见时情况如何，米高扬的访问终归带来了好处。“温哥华太阳报”要求美国接近苏联，而放弃敌视的态度。
    拉丁美洲各国的报纸广泛评论米高扬的访问美国。乌拉圭“人民报”发表社论指出，米高扬的访问美国是“苏联政府和平政策的又一次表现”。阿根廷许多报纸认为，米高扬同美国领导人的会谈将有助于加强两国之间的相互了解和削弱冷战。“目的”周刊说，苏联和美国之间的贸易可能有所扩大。
    英国报纸密切注意米高扬的访问美国。“每日邮报”驻华盛顿记者布罗德本写道：“从国际观点来看，米高扬此行意义不小。”“每日快报”并认为，米高扬同美国实业界人士的私人会见，证明苏联和美国在各方面进行合作有着广泛的可能性。“每日快报”驻纽约记者娄厄写道，纽约的观察家都相信，人们对杜勒斯明显的不满在增长，现在显然是改变杜勒斯奉行的“战争边缘”政策的时候了。
    印度的报纸也热烈评论米高扬访问美国这件事。“阿萨姆论坛报”的评论指出，必须举行有大国政府首脑参加的高级会议。报纸写道：
  “如果在举行这种会议以前先由美苏两国政府首脑举行双边谈判，这种会议取得成功在很大程度上是有保障的。”“星期日论坛报”指出，米高扬的访问美国“引起了世界不平常的兴趣。”这家报纸写道：“在充满了由于有核武器存在而引起的战争恐怖的世界中，没有比保障和平更为崇高的任务了。因此，必须研究达成国际互相谅解的一切可能。”
    日本“读卖新闻”发表社论指出，米高扬访问美国和苏联关于召开对德和会的建议具有重要意义。“读卖新闻”表示，它期望西方国家利用米高扬访问美国和苏联建议召开对德和会的机会，改善美苏两国间的关系。社论认为，这样将有助于和平。
