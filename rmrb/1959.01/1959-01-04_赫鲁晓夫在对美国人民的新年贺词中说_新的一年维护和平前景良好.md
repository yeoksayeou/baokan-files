Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 2nd: According to TASS, on January 2nd, the American "Mutual Broadcasting Company" broadcast Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's New Year's greeting to the American people.

Khrushchev said that he thanked the American "Mutual Broadcasting Company" for giving him the opportunity to extend New Year's greetings to the American people and to talk about how he assesses the prospects for peace in the new year of 1959.

Khrushchev believes that "in the new year of 1959, the prospects for maintaining and consolidating peace are good, because the solution to this problem depends on the wishes of the people of all countries, and now no country's people want war."

Khrushchev said, "We Soviet people believe that the American people, with their creative genius and whom we deeply respect, and the Soviet people, who yearn for peace and friendship among all countries, should and are playing a prominent role in consolidating the cause of peace. I think no one will deny that the people of our two countries bear a particularly important responsibility for the fate of peace, and a major responsibility for whether all mankind will continue to be threatened by new wars or be freed from the threat of war and breathe freely."

Khrushchev said, "The basis for our deep conviction is: we believe that there are currently no disputes or outstanding issues in relations between countries that cannot be resolved through peaceful means. Of course, this also requires all parties concerned to truly have such a desire. As for us, we can say that we do not lack this desire."

Khrushchev finally, on behalf of all the Soviet people, sincerely wished the American people good health and happiness in 1959, a peaceful and tranquil life, and wished for the development and consolidation of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States in strengthening peace.

    赫鲁晓夫在对美国人民的新年贺词中说
    新的一年维护和平前景良好
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：美国“相互广播公司”1月2日广播了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给美国人民的新年贺词。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他感谢美国“相互广播公司”给他向美国人民致新年贺词的机会，让他谈一谈他怎样估价新的1959年的和平远景。
    赫鲁晓夫认为：“在新的1959年，维护和巩固和平的远景是良好的，因为这个问题的解决取决于各国人民的愿望，而现在没有一个国家的人民愿意战争”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们苏联人认为，富有创造天才、深受我们敬仰的美国人民以及渴望和平和各国友好的苏联人民在巩固和平事业中应该而且正在起卓越的作用。我想，谁也不会否认，我们两国人民对和平的命运负有特别重大的责任，并且对全人类今后仍然受新战争威胁还是摆脱战争威胁而得到自由呼吸这件事负有重大责任。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，“我们的这种深切信念的根据是：我们认为，目前在各国关系中没有任何不能通过和平方法解决的争端或悬而未决的问题，当然，这也要求一切有关方面真正具有这样的愿望。至于我们，我们可以说，我们是不乏这种愿望的。
    赫鲁晓夫最后代表全体苏联人民衷心祝美国人民在1959年安康和幸福，过和平和安宁的生活，祝苏美两国之间在加强和平方面的友好合作发展和巩固。
