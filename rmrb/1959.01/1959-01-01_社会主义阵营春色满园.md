The year 1958 was an extraordinary year. It was the first year after the world situation underwent a great turning point in which the East Wind prevailed over the West Wind. Throughout the year, the East Wind grew stronger and stronger, while the West Wind became increasingly feeble. The socialist family achieved comprehensive victories on all construction fronts this year, and countless brilliant achievements filled the socialist camp with the colors of spring. The capitalist world, on the other hand, was battered by the bitter winds and rains of economic crisis, presenting a scene of decline and stagnation. Which system is superior and which will win, was clearer than ever this year.

Saying Goodbye to the Old Year in the Sound of Great Leaps Forward

At this moment of bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new, the working people of the world cannot but be delighted by the great achievements of the socialist camp as they look back on the road they have traveled this year. In 1958, the share of the total industrial output of the entire socialist camp in the world's total industrial output increased from about 33% in 1957 to 38%-40%. This is a huge leap forward, a result of the joint efforts of all countries in the socialist camp.

Let's first take a look at the achievements of the head of the socialist camp—the Soviet Union. The Soviet people won great victories on all construction fronts in 1958. From mid-December, news of pre-scheduled over-fulfillment of plans from various economic regions kept pouring in. This year, steel production was about 55 million tons, and oil was 113 million tons. This means that the amount of steel and oil produced in one month in 1958 was more than the total annual output of Tsarist Russia in 1913. Power generation reached more than 233 billion kilowatt-hours, and the power generated in three days was equal to the total annual power generation of Tsarist Russia. In this year, the Soviet Union built the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the Volga River, and the even larger Stalingrad Hydropower Station also started generating electricity a few days ago. In addition, in order to greatly increase steel production, the Soviet Union built seven blast furnaces in 1958 alone, their total production capacity being almost equal to the total production capacity of all blast furnaces built during the first two five-year plans of the Soviet Union. What a scale, what a speed!

In 1958, the Soviet Union achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on the agricultural front, with a total grain output of 8.5 billion poods. The state purchased more than 1.3 billion poods of grain than in 1957. Cotton production increased by half compared to 1957, and the beet harvest was also the largest in Soviet history. The output of other products such as milk also increased significantly.

Other socialist countries also spent this year with extraordinary achievements. The Korean people, riding the Chollima horse, are rushing forward to the socialist peak. Korea's total industrial output value in 1958 increased by more than 40% compared to 1957! Agriculture also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Grain production has completed the target for the last year (1961) of the first five-year plan, and cotton production is even more surprising, jumping to ten times the production in 1957, exceeding the planned output for 1961 by one time. The achievements of the Vietnamese people are also amazing. The total industrial output value in 1958 increased by more than 40% compared to 1957, exceeding the highest level during French rule. The agricultural harvest was also unprecedented, and the output of animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery all far exceeded the most prosperous years of the pre-war economy. The growth rate of industrial production in Czechoslovakia in 1958 was the highest in the past six years, and the total increase in agricultural production exceeded the sum of the growth rates in the previous four years. Albania's total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 20% compared to 1957. The growth rate of total industrial output value in East Germany in 1958 was the highest since 1953. The industrial output in the first three quarters increased by more than 11% compared to the same period last year, almost doubling the original national plan, and the total grain output also increased by 12% compared to 1957. Livestock products such as milk, pork, and eggs may reach the targets for 1960. Hungary's industrial output in this year increased by 13% compared to 1957. The production tasks of other fraternal countries such as Romania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, and Poland were also completed very well. For example, the coal industry sector in Poland achieved the greatest achievement in the past ten years since the war. The development of China's national economy in 1958 also achieved unprecedented great victories. The total output value of industry and agriculture increased by about 70% compared to 1957. The output of steel, coal, grain, and cotton has doubled or more... The construction achievements of socialist countries in 1958 are truly countless!

Reaching a New Level

Based on the brilliant achievements already made, socialist countries have formulated grand plans for further great development or put forward new and greater combat goals in this year. In the coming years, the economy of socialist countries will reach a new level and achieve greater achievements. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has put forward a grand seven-year plan to move towards communism, aiming to increase the output value of industry and agriculture by 80% and 70% respectively after seven years. The Polish people have proposed to increase the level of industrial production to ten times that before liberation after seven years. The Bulgarian people have widely launched a nationwide campaign, proposing the bold slogan of completing the five-year plan one or two years ahead of schedule. The Vietnamese people have exerted their revolutionary efforts, launching a mass movement to carry out socialist revolution, preparing conditions for a great leap forward. East Germany has also put forward the combat slogan of "surpassing West Germany in per capita consumption of all major living materials and consumer goods by 1961." The Chinese people will also continue to work hard this year to achieve a greater leap forward than in 1958. These plans and goals have greatly encouraged and mobilized the people, becoming the guiding principles for the actions of people in various countries.

New Measures and New Atmosphere

The reason why the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have achieved such brilliant achievements in the past year is inseparable from a series of major reform measures they have taken in the economic field and the full mobilization of the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people.

The socialist system has created conditions for people to use scientific laws to seek welfare for society. The political parties of the working class in socialist countries rely on the economic law that the relations of production must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces, and constantly take various measures to adjust the relations of production and promote the development of the productive forces. For example, after the implementation of the measures to reorganize the management of industry and construction, the Soviet Union implemented two major measures in 1958 based on the existing economic and technical conditions of collective farms and the development level of agricultural productive forces: reorganizing machine tractor stations and implementing a new procurement system. From the reorganization of machine tractor stations in the spring of 1958 to the present, about 80% of machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union have been converted into technical repair stations, and more than 81% of collective farms have purchased agricultural machinery worth more than 21 billion rubles. From the perspective of the months since the reorganization, the machines have been fully utilized and the enthusiasm of the peasants has been greatly improved because the peasants directly control the machines. The new procurement system for agricultural products implemented on July 1, 1958, greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of peasants due to the abolition of requisition and purchase methods and the implementation of the principle of adapting to local conditions.

Following the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia also implemented major measures to reorganize industrial management in April 1958. This reorganization simplified the management levels, implemented the decentralization of power and cadres, which made it easier for the central competent authorities to lead, and greatly improved the enthusiasm of enterprises and working people. Due to this reform, Czechoslovakia's industrial production in 1958 will exceed the original plan by 3%.

In 1958, China implemented the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. On the industrial front, it adopted the policy of taking steel as the key link, making an all-round leap forward, simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, combining large, medium, and small-sized enterprises, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements, which enabled China's national economy to achieve leap forward development.

In this year, the agricultural cooperation movement in fraternal countries has also made great progress. For example, the collectivization of agriculture in Korea has been fully realized, and more than 92% of farmers in Bulgaria have joined cooperatives. 99% of farmers in China have joined people's communes.

The above-mentioned major measures, as well as other measures taken by socialist countries to develop industrial and agricultural productive forces, have promoted the unprecedented upsurge of the economies of various countries.

In the past year, the people of socialist countries have exerted their greatest enthusiasm in order to build their motherland better and more beautiful. Because of this, the achievements of socialist countries this year have emitted such brilliant light. For example, the Soviet people launched a magnificent "Communist Labor Brigade" movement in order to accelerate the realization of the grand goal of the seven-year plan. In Czechoslovakia, a high tide of establishing "Socialist Labor Brigades" was set off. Under the call of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean people launched a nationwide campaign to build power stations and vigorously develop local industries. Under the slogan of "completing the five-year plan in three to four years," Bulgarian farmers launched a mass movement to build water conservancy projects. Under the encouragement of the general line of building socialism, the Chinese people exerted their soaring energy on the industrial and agricultural production fronts and realized a great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

The widespread participation of cadres in physical labor and the strengthening of students' connection with life are also new atmospheres in the socialist family in 1958. For example, in Vietnam, leading cadres took the lead in going to the countryside and factories this year, and hundreds of literary and art workers went to the mountains and countryside to participate in physical labor. Bulgaria and Albania have decided that cadres must participate in one month of physical labor every year. In Czechoslovakia, with the streamlining of institutions, a large number of cadres were transferred to factories and mines to work as workers, and scientific workers were transferred to production units. This has greatly improved the relationship between cadres and the masses and promoted the development of production.

The East Wind Blows Strongly, the West Wind Declines

In 1958, socialist countries spent the year in a great leap forward in production, while capitalist countries declined and fell into economic crises, and internal contradictions became increasingly acute. For example, the industrial output of the most developed capitalist country, the United States, is expected to decrease by 7% in 1958 (according to preliminary materials published by American newspapers). Western European capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and Italy also saw off 1958 in a bleak scene of production reduction and stagnation, increased unemployment, and shrinking domestic and foreign markets.

Over the past year, the prosperity of production in socialist countries has more fully proved that socialism will surely win in the peaceful competition with capitalism.

Comparing the Soviet Union and the United States, in 1958, the Soviet Union not only greatly exceeded the United States in the output of combine harvesters, peat, manganese, wheat, beets, sugar, etc., and continued to lead, but also the coal output has begun to exceed the United States, ranking first in the world. In 1958, the Soviet Union's coal output will be about 100 million tons more than the United States, and the United States has been far behind. The distance between the Soviet Union's steel output and the United States has also been greatly reduced this year. The Soviet Union's steel output has jumped from 45% of the United States in 1957 to 78.9% in 1958.

According to the tasks put forward in the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, the Soviet people will catch up with the United States in the output of all important products per capita in twelve years.

Other socialist countries are also striving to economically surpass some developed capitalist countries. For example, Korea's per capita production of cement, coal, and fish has exceeded Japan, and it will catch up with Japan in other major industrial products this year. East Germany has left West Germany behind in the per capita consumption of food and important industrial consumer goods, Czechoslovakia's steel production per capita has exceeded France and Sweden, and is increasingly approaching Britain. The output of metal cutting machine tools is close to the United States, and the per capita output of rolling equipment is equal to the United States. Poland's per capita steel output has exceeded Japan and Italy.

The situation in 1958 shows that this is a year when the East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind. The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. A bright future belongs to our powerful socialist camp!

    社会主义阵营春色满园
    方竞秀
    1958年是不平凡的一年。这是世界形势发生了东风压倒西风的伟大转折后的第一年。这一年来，东风威力日益劲疾，西风却声息日微。社会主义大家庭这一年在各个建设战线上全面获捷，数不清的辉煌灿烂的成就使社会主义阵营春色满园。资本主义世界则为经济危机的凄风苦雨所吹打，呈现出一片衰退和停滞。两种制度谁优谁劣，谁胜谁负，这一年真是看得再也明显不过了。
    跃进声中辞旧岁
    在这送旧岁迎新年的时刻，回顾一年来所走过的道路，全世界劳动人民都不能不为社会主义阵营的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。1958年整个社会主义阵营的工业产量在世界工业总产量中所占的份额，已由1957年的33％左右提高到38％—40％。这是一个巨大的跃进，这是社会主义阵营各国共同努力的结果。
    让我们先来看看社会主义阵营之首——苏联的成就吧。苏联人民1958年在各个建设战线上都打了大胜仗。从12月中旬开始，各经济区提前超额完成计划的消息不断传来。这一年钢产量约五千五百万吨，石油一亿一千三百万吨，这就是说，1958年一个月所生产的钢和石油要比1913年帝俄全年产量还多。发电量达到二千三百三十多亿度，每三天的发电量就等于沙皇俄国全年的发电量。苏联在这一年里建成了世界最大的伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站，更大的斯大林格勒水电站也在前几天开始发电了。此外，为了大量增产钢铁，苏联1958年一年就建成了七座高炉，它们的生产总能力几乎等于苏联头两个五年计划时期建设的全部高炉的生产能力。这是多么大的规模，多么快的速度！
    1958年苏联在农业战线上获得了历史上空前的大丰收，谷物总产量达到八十五亿普特，国家采购的粮食比1957年增加十三亿普特以上，棉花产量比1957年增加了一半，甜菜的收成也是苏联有史以来最多的。其他如牛奶等的产量，也增加了很多。
    其他社会主义国家，也都以不平凡的成就度过了这一年。跨上了千里马的朝鲜人民，正向社会主义高峰飞奔前进。朝鲜1958年的工业总产值比1957年增加了40％之多！农业也获得了史无前例的大丰收。粮食产量已完成了第一个五年计划最后一年（1961年）的指标，棉花产量更令人惊喜，一跃而为1957年产量的十倍，比1961年的计划产量超出了一倍。越南人民的成就也很惊人，1958年的工业总产值比1957年增加40％以上，超过了法国统治时期的最高水平。农业丰收也是空前的，而且畜牧、林业、渔业的产量，都远远超过了战前经济最繁荣的年代。捷克斯洛伐克1958年工业生产的增长速度是以往六年中最高的一年，农业总增产量则超过了以往四年增长率的总和。阿尔巴尼亚1958年工业总产值比1957年增长了20％。民主德国1958年的工业总产值增长率是自1953年以来最高的一年，头三个季度工业产量比去年同期增长11％以上，比国家原定计划几乎增加了一倍，谷物总产量也比1957年增加了12％，牛奶、猪肉、鸡蛋等畜产品，都可能达到1960年的指标。匈牙利这一年中工业产量比1957年增加了13％，其他罗马尼亚、保加利亚、蒙古、波兰等兄弟国家的生产任务也完成得很好，例如波兰的煤炭工业部门获得了战后十年以来最大的成就。我国1958年国民经济的发展，也获得了空前伟大的胜利。工农业总产值比1957年增加了70％左右。钢、煤、粮食和棉花的产量，都翻了一番或一番多……。社会主义国家1958年的建设成就真是数不胜数！
    更上一层楼
    根据已取得的光辉战果，社会主义国家在这一年中制定了进一步大发展的宏伟计划或提出了新的更大的战斗目标。在未来的年月中，社会主义国家的经济将更上一层楼，取得更大的成就。大家都知道，苏联提出了向共产主义迈进的宏伟的七年计划，七年后要使工农业产值分别增加80％和70％。波兰人民则提出七年后要使工业生产水平提高到解放前的十倍。保加利亚人民广泛展开了全民运动，提出要提前一两年完成五年计划的豪迈口号。越南人民发挥革命干劲，掀起了进行社会主义革命的群众运动，为迎接大跃进准备条件。民主德国也提出到1961年“在所有主要生活资料和消费品的每人平均消费量方面超过西德”的战斗口号。我国人民也要在今年再接再厉，实现比1958年更伟大的跃进。这些计划和目标都大大鼓舞和动员了人民，成为各国人民行动的指针。
    新措施和新气象
    一年来，苏联和各社会主义国家所以取得如此辉煌的成就，是同它们在经济方面采取的一系列重大改革措施和充分发挥广大人民群众的积极性分不开的。
    社会主义制度为人们利用科学法则来为社会谋求福利创造了条件。社会主义各国工人阶级的政党依靠着生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则，不断采取各种措施调整生产关系，促进生产力的发展。例如，苏联紧接着改组工业和建筑业管理措施实施之后，1958年又根据集体农庄已有的经济、技术条件和农业生产力的发展水平，先后实行了改组机器拖拉机站和新的采购制度两项重大措施。从1958年春机器拖拉机站改组后到目前为止，全苏已约有80％的机器拖拉机站改为技术修理站，81％以上的集体农庄购买了价值二百一十多亿卢布的农业机器。从改组以来的几个月看，由于农民自己直接支配机器，机器得到了充分的利用，农民的积极性大大提高了。1958年7月1日实行的农产品新采购制度，由于废除征购办法和贯彻了因地制宜的原则，大大刺激了农民的生产积极性。
    继苏联之后，捷克斯洛伐克在1958年4月也实行了工业管理改组的重大措施。这次改组简化了管理层次，实行权力和干部下放，这使中央主管部门更便于领导，企业和劳动人民的积极性大大提高了。由于这次改革，捷克斯洛伐克1958年的工业生产将超额3％完成原定计划。
    在1958年，我国在优先发展重工业的基础上实行了工农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针，在工业战线上采取了以钢为纲、全面跃进、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大中小相结合、土洋并举，以及集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合等方针，使我国的国民经济取得了飞跃的发展。
    在这一年中，兄弟国家的农业合作化运动也有了很大的发展。例如，朝鲜农村已全部实现合作化，保加利亚加入合作社的农户已达92％以上。我国99％的农户已经参加了人民公社。
    上述各项重大措施，以及社会主义国家采取的发展工农业生产力的其他措施，促进了各国经济的空前高涨。
    一年来，社会主义国家的人民为了把祖国建设得更好、更美丽，发挥了最大的积极性。正因为这样，才使得社会主义国家这一年的成就发射出如此灿烂的光芒。例如，苏联人民为了加速实现七年计划的宏伟目标，展开了波澜壮阔的“共产主义劳动工作队”运动。在捷克斯洛伐克则掀起了一个建立“社会主义劳动队”的高潮。朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的号召下，展开了全民办电、全民大办地方工业。保加利亚农民在“五年计划三至四年完成”的口号下，展开了兴修水利的群众运动。我国人民在建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，在工农业生产战线上发挥了冲天的干劲，实现了工农业的大跃进。
    干部广泛参加体力劳动、学生加强同生活的联系，也是1958年社会主义大家庭中的新气象。例如越南，这一年里领导干部带头下乡、下厂，数百名文艺工作者上山下乡参加了体力劳动。保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚已决定干部每年必须参加一个月的体力劳动。在捷克斯洛伐克，随着机构的精简，大批干部下放到厂矿中当工人，科学工作者纷纷下放到生产单位。这使干部和群众的关系大大密切了，并促进了生产的发展。
    东风劲吹西风衰
    1958年里，社会主义国家是在生产大跃进中度过的，而资本主义国家日趋没落，陷入经济危机，内部各种矛盾日益尖锐化。例如，最发达的资本主义国家美国的工业产量，预计
  （根据美国报纸公布的初步材料）1958年将下降7％，英国、法国、意大利等西欧资本主义国家也是在生产缩减和停滞、失业人数增加、国内外市场萎缩的惨淡景象中送走1958年的。
    一年以来，社会主义国家生产的繁荣情况，更加充分证明在同资本主义的和平竞赛中，社会主义必将获得胜利。
    以苏联和美国相比来看。1958年，苏联不仅在联合机、泥炭、锰、小麦、甜菜、糖等的产量方面大大多于美国，继续领先，而且煤产量已开始超过美国，跃居世界第一位。1958年苏联煤产量将比美国多一亿吨左右，美国已被远远地抛在后边了。苏联钢产量同美国的距离这一年也大大缩小了，苏联钢产量已由1957年为美国的45％跃为1958年的78.9％。
    根据苏联七年计划所提出的任务，苏联人民在十二年后将在按人口平均的一切重要产品的产量方面赶过美国。
    其他社会主义国家也正在为在经济上赶过一些发达的资本主义国家而努力。例如，朝鲜按人口平均计算生产的水泥、煤炭、鱼类已超过日本，而且今年即要在其他主要工业品方面赶上日本。民主德国在食品和重要工业消费品按人口平均的消费量方面，已把西德抛在后面，捷克斯洛伐克的钢铁生产，按人口计算已超过法国和瑞典，而且日益接近英国，金属切削机床的产量接近美国，按人口平均的轧制设备的产量则和美国相等。波兰的钢产量按人口平均计算已经超过日本和意大利。
    1958年的情况说明了这是东风进一步压倒西风的一年，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。光辉灿烂的未来属于我们强大的社会主义阵营！
