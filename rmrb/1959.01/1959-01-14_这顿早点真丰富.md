This Breakfast is Really Rich
The sky had just begun to blush with the red of dawn when the train from Taiyuan to Xi'an began serving a palatable breakfast. Passengers could freely choose from fried dough twists, small sesame seed cakes, small steamed buns, small stuffed buns, sweet congee, noodle soup, meat soup, vegetable soup, and several kinds of side dishes.

The round trip from Taiyuan to Xi'an requires selling over four thousand meals. How can the ten staff members on the dining car prepare and sell so many meals? It turns out that after the Great Leap Forward, all the staff on the train launched a mass collaboration movement, with everyone becoming a multi-skilled worker. This rich breakfast is prepared by them during their rest time. (Xiao Han) (Attached pictures)

    这顿早点真丰富
    天空刚刚泛起红润的早霞，从太原开往西安的列车就开始供应适口的早餐了。旅客们可以随意吃到油炸麻花、小酥油饼、小馒头、小包子、甜稀饭、汤面、肉汤、素汤和好几种小菜。
    从太原到西安往返一次要卖四千多份饭菜，餐车上只有十个工作人员，怎么能连做带卖这么多的饭菜呢？原来是大跃进以后，列车上所有的工作人员展开大协作、人人都当多面手运动，这顿丰富的早点就是他们利用休息时间准备的。　（肖寒）（附图片）
