    Nanchang, January 14th (by our newspaper) - The "August 1st" People's Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has mobilized the masses to speak out freely, using the mass line method to establish a production responsibility system at each level, which has raised the consciousness of the commune members and further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune's various organizations and the vast number of commune members.
    After the "August 1st" Commune was established in September of last year, the original agricultural cooperative's management systems of "four fixings and three guarantees," "three fixings and one evaluation," full rewards and full compensation, and work point calculation were no longer fully adapted to the new situation of the commune. How to establish a new production responsibility system became a very important issue facing the commune. To this end, the commune launched a free-speaking debate among all commune members in order to establish the responsibility system on the basis of mass consciousness and better promote the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of commune members.
    During the debate, four opinions emerged: The first opinion was that there was no need to establish a production responsibility system. It was believed that as long as the "three transformations" were carried out well, coupled with commendation, criticism, and debate, commune members would actively produce. The second opinion was to completely copy the past management methods of agricultural cooperatives. The third opinion was that communist labor is unremunerated and without fixed quotas, and the commune should now cultivate this labor consciousness among commune members. The fourth opinion was to establish a new production responsibility system suitable for the characteristics of the commune while strengthening communist education and raising the labor consciousness of commune members.
    Based on these four opinions, the commune's Party committee organized cadres and commune members to further conduct debates. Everyone pointed out in the debate that the "three transformations" cannot replace the production responsibility system; the production responsibility system can achieve clear division of labor and make everyone responsible for each production item. In this way, in coordination with the "three transformations," labor efficiency can be further improved. At the same time, everyone pointed out that the commune's production responsibility system cannot be exactly the same as that of agricultural cooperatives, because the situations of the commune and agricultural cooperatives are different. Finally, all cadres and commune members unanimously agreed with the last opinion, proposing to establish a production responsibility system suitable for the commune on the basis of carrying out communist education and raising the consciousness of commune members.
    Based on the unanimous opinions of all cadres and commune members after speaking out freely, the commune Party committee finally determined: the commune, according to the state plan and its own production conditions, on the basis of "four fixings" (oxen, farm tools, labor, and land), implements "five fixings" for the brigades, fixing the planting area of crops, costs, yield, quality, and total wages. After the commune handed over the production responsibility to the production brigades, it also carried out "four grasps" for the brigades (grasping production plans, financial plans, labor arrangements, and livelihood management) to ensure that the brigades shoulder this production responsibility. The production brigades, according to the various tasks and arrangements uniformly given by the commune, implement "six fixings" for the teams, fixing planting area, yield, cost, labor, and six other items. In order to ensure the implementation of the "six fixings," the brigades also carried out "four grasps" for the teams: grasping ideology, grasping plans, grasping labor arrangements, and grasping livelihood. In addition, for small farm tasks suitable for individuals to do, a special person responsibility system of "three fixings" (fixing time, quantity, and quality) was also established. In this way, the production responsibility was specifically assigned to the commune members, which can not only enhance the commune members' sense of production responsibility, but also encourage the commune members' production enthusiasm, so as to ensure the completion of various production tasks.
    In order to encourage the production enthusiasm of commune members, the commune also established a corresponding reward method, that is, 20% of the total wage of the entire commune is drawn as a reward fund, with the commune and the brigade each controlling 20% of it, to reward model production units and collectives; the remaining 60% is controlled by the team and directly awarded to the commune members.
    It has been two months since the "August 1st" Commune established the production responsibility system, and the effect is remarkable, which has powerfully promoted production. The commune, brigades, and teams arrange production tasks at each level, with clear responsibilities, and all production in the commune is orderly; commune members are clear about their production tasks, enhance their sense of responsibility, and their labor enthusiasm is even higher. The commune has completed 80% of its task of building 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects to date; the amount of accumulated fertilizer is two-thirds more than the same period last year. Thanks to the special management and care of the commune members, more than 20,000 mu of overwintering crops are growing vigorously. Recently, the commune conducted an evaluation of the implementation of various production responsibilities and selected more than 2,000 model commune members and labor activists, and more than 100 model collectives and units.

### 自觉劳动和责任制相结合  “八一”公社各项生产有条不紊，劳动效率大提高

    自觉劳动和责任制相结合
    “八一”公社各项生产有条不紊，劳动效率大提高
    本报南昌14日电　江西省南昌县“八一”人民公社发动群众鸣放，用群众路线的方法层层建立生产责任制，提高了社员的觉悟，进一步发挥了公社各级组织和广大社员的生产积极性。
    “八一”公社于去年9月建成后，原农业社的“四定三包”、
  “三定一评”、全奖全赔和评工计分等管理制度，与公社的新情况不完全相适应了，如何建立新的生产责任制，成为公社面临的一个很重要的问题。为此，公社发动了全体社员进行鸣放辩论，以便把责任制建立在群众自觉的基础上，更好地促进社员的积极性和提高责任心。
    辩论过程中，出现了四种意见：第一种意见是不要建立生产责任制。认为只要把“三化”搞好，再加上表扬、批评、辩论，社员就会积极生产。第二种意见是全部照搬过去农业社的管理办法。第三种意见认为共产主义劳动是不计报酬、无定额的劳动，现在公社就应该培养社员这种劳动自觉性。第四种意见是，在加强共产主义教育、提高社员劳动自觉性的同时，建立适于公社特点的新的生产责任制。
    根据这四种意见，公社党委组织干部与社员进一步开展了辩论。大家在辩论中指出，“三化”并不能代替生产责任制；生产责任制能做到分工明确、项项生产有人负责。这样，配合“三化”就能使劳动效率更加提高。同时，大家指出，公社的生产责任制也不能和农业社的完全一样，因为公社与农业社的情况不同。最后全体干部与社员一致同意了最后一种意见，提出在开展共产主义教育、提高社员觉悟的基础上，建立适于公社的生产责任制。
    公社党委根据全体干部和社员鸣放后一致的意见，最后确定：公社根据国家计划和本社生产条件，在“四固定”（耕牛、农具、劳力、土地）的基础上，对大队实行“五定”，定种植作物面积、成本、产量、质量、工资总额。公社把生产责任交给生产大队后，对大队还进行“四抓”（抓生产计划、财务计划、劳力安排、生活管理），以保证大队把这一生产责任担负起来。生产大队根据公社统一给的各项任务和安排，对小队实行“六定”，定种植面积、产量、成本、劳力等六项。大队为了保证“六定”的执行，对小队也进行“四抓”：抓思想、抓计划、抓劳动力安排、抓生活。此外，对于适合于个人做的小农活，还确定了“三定”（定时间、数量、质量）的专人负责制。这样，把生产责任分别具体地交给了社员，既可增强社员的生产责任心，又可鼓励社员的生产积极性，以保证各项生产任务的完成。
    公社为了鼓励社员生产积极性，还建立了一个相应的奖励办法，即由全社工资总额中抽出20％为奖励基金，公社、大队各掌握其中的20％，奖励模范生产单位与集体；其余60％由小队掌握，直接奖给社员。
    “八一”公社建立生产责任制至今已两个月，效果显著，有力地推动了生产。公社、大队、小队层层安排生产任务，责任明确，全社各项生产有条不紊；社员明确自己的生产任务，增强了责任心，劳动积极性更加高涨。全社兴修水利工程五十万土方的任务，至今已完成80％；积肥量比去年同期多三分之二。由于有专门社员培育管理，二万多亩越冬作物长得茁壮。最近公社对各项生产责任的执行进行了一次评比，评比出模范社员和劳动积极分子二千多人，模范集体和单位一百多个。
