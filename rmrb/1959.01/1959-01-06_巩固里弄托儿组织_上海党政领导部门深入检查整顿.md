Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 3rd: Shanghai's Party and government leadership at all levels are taking various measures to rectify neighborhood nursery organizations. Recently, many district Party committee secretaries, district heads and department heads responsible for cultural and educational work, as well as responsible cadres from the Women's Federation and other relevant departments, have personally led inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of this work in neighborhoods.

Currently, the city has more than 3,300 nurseries, kindergartens, and breastfeeding rooms, caring for over 126,900 children. The staff of these childcare organizations are mostly working women who have just come out of their families. They are highly motivated and energetic, but lack experience. Some people do not fully understand the important significance of this work, feeling that "serving people" is not a promising job, and are not at ease in their work. In response to this situation, Party and government leaders in various districts are personally grasping political and ideological work, holding forums, making reports, and organizing childcare workers to visit and learn, while also adopting mass self-education methods such as mass airing of views, big debates, to make them fully realize the important significance of childcare work. Gu Weihan, Secretary of the Huangpu District Party Committee and District Head, personally serves as the director of the Jinling East Road Third Nursery, often studying the situation with the staff and specifically helping them solve difficulties, which greatly encourages the nursery staff.

Cultivating backbone forces and spreading advanced experience is an important link in rectifying and consolidating neighborhood nursery organizations. While mobilizing a large number of outstanding young working women to participate in nursery work, various districts are taking various measures to carry out professional training. Most districts have held training classes for nursery workers. The Jinling East Road Subdistrict Office's nursery worker training class is taught political classes by the director of the District Women's Federation, business classes by experienced kindergarten directors and nursery staff, and hygiene knowledge classes by medical staff, with very good results. Many citizen-run spare-time middle schools in Xincheng District, with the help of teachers from the Shanghai Preschool Teachers School, have established preschool specialty classes, which have recruited more than 1,000 students. The newly established private kindergartens are widely linked to public kindergartens, and experienced childcare workers from public kindergartens are transferred to provide business guidance to neighborhood nurseries. Some old and new kindergartens and nurseries also transfer personnel to each other, with the old leading the new. The city's medical and health institutions and medical colleges have organized a large medical and health army of 10,000 people, who go to nurseries and kindergartens in different districts to impart health and hygiene knowledge, and examine the physical condition of childcare workers and children in care. Specific guidance was given on the nursing and isolation of sick children, the disinfection of children's eating utensils and towels, and children's nutrition.

Many government departments and agencies, factories, and enterprises, where possible, also provide necessary material support to some childcare organizations with relatively poor conditions, allocating some cotton quilts, cotton blankets, straw and other winter warming supplies, as well as tables, chairs, and toys.

Under the care and support of the Party and the government, and with the help of all parties, neighborhood nursery organizations have undergone further development after this period of rectification. At present, the city's nurseries and kindergartens have various forms, including half-day care, full-day care, and full-time care. There are also isolation rooms for sick children. Many kindergartens and nurseries not only take good care of the children, feeding them well and keeping them warm, but also pay attention to nutrition. The children at the Xingfu Nursery in the Yimiao District have gained significant weight in less than three months after entering the nursery, with the children in the small class gaining an average of three jin each. Liu Junjian of the Jin Situ Temple Lixing Kindergarten used to eat snacks randomly at home, which damaged his stomach and he had to take "Digestive Tablets" every day to help digestion. Now, Liu Junjian no longer eats snacks, eats his meals, and is stronger. The staff of some kindergartens and nurseries not only let the children eat well and play well, but also provide haircuts and mend clothes for the children, striving to be "multi-skilled."

The childcare workers' enthusiastic work and conscientious and meticulous service attitude have been widely welcomed and trusted by parents.

    巩固里弄托儿组织
    上海党政领导部门深入检查整顿
    新华社上海3日电　上海市各级党政领导部门，采取各种措施，整顿里弄托儿组织。最近许多区委书记和负责文教工作的区长和部长以及妇联等有关方面负责干部都亲自带领检查组，深入里弄检查这一工作。
    目前全市已有托儿所、幼儿园、哺乳室三千三百多个，收托儿童十二万六千九百多名。这些托儿组织的工作人员，绝大部分是刚从家庭出来的劳动妇女，她们积极性很高，干劲很足，但缺乏经验，有的人对这种工作的重要意义还认识不足，觉得“侍候人”的工作没出息，不安心工作。各区的党政领导针对这一情况都亲自抓政治思想工作，召开座谈会，作报告，组织保教人员参观、访问，同时采取大鸣、大放、大辩论的群众自我教育方式，使她们充分认识到保育工作的重要意义。黄浦区区委书记、区长顾维汉亲自担任金陵东路第三托儿所所长，经常和工作人员一起研究情况，具体帮助她们解决困难，使托儿所工作人员受到很大鼓舞。
    培养骨干力量，传播先进经验是整顿和巩固里弄托儿组织的重要一环。各区在动员大批的优秀青年劳动妇女参加托儿所工作的同时，采取各种办法，开展业务训练。大多数区都举办了保育员训练班。金陵东路办事处的保育员训练班由区妇联主任担任政治课，有经验的幼儿园主任、保育人员讲业务课，医务人员负责卫生知识课，效果很好。新成区许多市民业余中学，在上海市幼儿师范学校教师帮助下，设立了幼儿专科班，已招收学员一千多人。新成立的民办幼儿园广泛和公办幼儿园挂钩，由公办幼儿园抽调有经验的保育人员给里弄托儿所作业务辅导。有的新老幼儿园、托儿所，还互调人员，以老带新。全市医疗保健机关和医学院校组织了一支万人医务保健大军，分区分段深入托儿所、幼儿园传授卫生保健知识，为保育人员和入托的孩子检查体格。对病儿的护理隔离、孩子的食具和毛巾的消毒，儿童的营养等问题，都作了具体的指导。
    许多政府部门和机关、工厂、企业，对某些条件比较差的托儿组织，在可能条件下，还给予必要的物质支援，拨给了一部分棉被、棉毯、稻草等过冬保暖物资和桌椅玩具等。
    里弄托儿组织，在党和政府的关怀和支持下，在各方面的帮助下，经过了这一时期的整顿，有了更进一步的发展。目前全市托儿所、幼儿园的形式多样，有半日托、日托、和全托，生病孩子还设有隔离室。许多幼儿园托儿所不仅把孩子照顾好，吃饱穿暖，还注意营养。邑庙区幸福托儿所的孩子入所不到三个月体重都有显著的增加，小班的孩子每人平均增加三斤。金司徒庙理星幼儿园的柳钧建，在家时乱吃零食，把胃吃坏了，天天吃“食母生”帮助消化。现在柳钧建已不吃零食，饭吃得下，身体也更结实了。有的幼儿园、托儿所的工作人员不仅让孩子吃好，玩好；还为孩子们理发、补衣服等，争取做个“多面手”。
    保育人员的热忱的劳动和认真细致的服务态度，普遍得到家长的欢迎和信任。
