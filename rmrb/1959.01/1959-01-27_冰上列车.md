    "Ice Train"
    On the West Liao River in the Jirem League of Inner Mongolia, people of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups have jointly built an ice road transportation line from Weiliansu in Naiman Banner to Tongliao City, with a total length of 250 kilometers. Hundreds of ice sleds, pulled by tractors, are continuously transporting large quantities of grain and goods. It is estimated that in the winter and spring seasons, this league can transport approximately 100,000 to 150,000 tons of materials using the "Ice Train," saving more than one million yuan in transportation costs.

    “冰上列车”
    内蒙古哲里木盟西辽河上，蒙汉等族人民合力修成一条从奈曼旗苇连苏到通辽市的冰道运输线，全长二百五十公里。数百台冰上爬犁在拖拉机牵引下，源源不绝地运送大批粮食和货物。据估计，这个盟在冬春两季，利用“冰上列车”约可运输物资十万吨到十五万吨，节省运费一百多万元。
