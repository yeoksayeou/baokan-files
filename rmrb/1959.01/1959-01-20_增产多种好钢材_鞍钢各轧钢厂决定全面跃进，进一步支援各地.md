This dispatch from Anshan on the 19th reports: Since the beginning of 1959, the dozen or so rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel, based on summarizing the experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward, are mobilizing workers to adopt effective measures to strive to roll out steel materials in greater quantities, better quality, and more varieties than last year, to meet the needs of the greater leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production and construction.

In the past year, the steel materials rolled by Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills were more than in any previous year. The total output of various steel materials increased by 31% compared to 1957, equivalent to seven times the highest annual output during the Japanese puppet regime in 1943. From January to November 1958, heavy rails alone increased by 160,000 tons compared to the same period in 1957; the output of high-quality steel materials increased tenfold compared to the same period in 1957. During this year, various rolling mills also successfully rolled out more than one hundred new specifications and new varieties of steel materials. Among the new products are high-strength low-alloy steel plates, giant I-beams up to one foot and six inches high for building bridges and large factories, steel plates as thick as three or four inches, and stainless steel tubes so fine that they can be used as injection needles. These new varieties of steel materials were all not rolled in our country in the past.

The large amount of steel materials rolled by Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills in 1958 played a huge role in the great leap forward of China's machinery industry and transportation industry, and the construction of important projects. Now, the "Liberation" brand automobiles running all over the country, from the chassis to the frame, use various steel materials; the various bridge steels used for the soon-to-be-completed Wujiang Bridge; the heavy rails laid in railway construction, etc., are mostly rolled by Anshan Iron and Steel's rolling mills. During this year, various rolling mills provided many steel materials for manufacturing tractors to tractor factories in Luoyang, Tianjin, and other places, and also supported minority nationality areas such as the Zhuang and Miao peoples in building small hydropower stations with some steel materials. During this year, Anshan Iron and Steel supported Shanghai alone with more than 200,000 tons of steel materials for manufacturing machinery, electric motors, and ships.

The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's various rolling mills all regard supporting the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production and construction as the most glorious task. In 1958, they put forward the slogan "Roll whatever the country needs, roll as much as the country needs," and tried every means to promptly roll out various steel materials urgently needed in various regions. When railway construction in various regions urgently needed to lay heavy rails, the workers of the large rolling mill responsible for the production of heavy rails nationwide vigorously improved operating techniques and increased the output of heavy rails. From January to October, they rolled out hundreds of thousands of tons of heavy rails, which promptly supported railway construction. After October, the workers devised ways to increase the average daily output of heavy rails by nearly double compared to the beginning of the year, thereby increasing the annual output of heavy rails by more than 100,000 tons compared to 1957. When motor manufacturing plants in various regions urgently needed silicon steel sheets, the workers of the Second Thin Plate Plant devised methods to adopt the multi-sheet rolling method, increasing the output of silicon steel sheets from the original 5,000 sheets per shift to more than 8,000 sheets. According to design requirements, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant could only roll seamless steel tubes with diameters of 38 mm to 140 mm, but in order to meet the needs of construction, the workers developed the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and not only test-rolled seamless steel tubes with a diameter of 168 mm, but also drew stainless steel tubes with a diameter of 25 mm into capillary tubes and injection needles on self-made cold drawing machines. No. 55 I-beams are steel materials necessary for building large factories and bridges and other projects, but the large rolling mill that specializes in rolling large steel materials can only roll No. 30 I-beams according to design standards, so in the past, the No. 55 I-beams used in various regions had to be imported from abroad. This year, the workers of the Anshan Initial Rolling Plant and the company's researchers closely combined and boldly used grooved rolls on the initial rolling mill to roll out special-shaped steel billets, and the workers of the large rolling mill used this steel billet to roll out No. 55 I-beams. Various rolling mills also rolled high-strength low-alloy steel materials. Using this steel material in machinery manufacturing and the construction industry can save 15% to 20% compared to ordinary carbon steel materials, and can extend the life of machinery and buildings. Now, from the radio towers in the capital to the oil drilling rigs in the southwest and northwest, from shipbuilding and automobiles to the manufacture of fertilizer equipment, this low-alloy steel material has begun to be used. In the first half of last year, when the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant trial-produced the Dongfeng brand car, the rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel promptly rolled the steel plates and cold-drawn steel tubes used to manufacture this car. When the Dalian Shipyard built China's first 10,000-ton giant ship, it urgently needed large bulb flats and thick steel plates, etc., and the workers of Anshan's large rolling mill and medium plate mill promptly rolled out this steel plate to meet the needs of the factory. Recently, the large rolling mill is also test-rolling 120 mm thick steel plates that can be used for the base of a 12,000-ton large hydraulic press.

Now, in order to achieve this year's requirements of "high quality, multiple varieties," various rolling mills are organizing the vast number of workers to combine the study of the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with summarizing the experiences of last year's great leap forward in production. Various rolling mills have also arranged production plans for January, organized forces to overhaul mechanical equipment as early as possible, strengthened measures for safe production, established a product quality inspection system, and vigorously organized the production of spare parts and accessories, so as to build this year's production plan on a fully reliable material basis.

    增产多种好钢材
    鞍钢各轧钢厂决定全面跃进，进一步支援各地
    本报鞍山19日电　进入1959年以来，鞍钢十几个轧钢厂在总结去年跃进经验的基础上，正在发动职工采取有效措施，力争轧制出比去年数量大、质量好、品种多的钢材，满足全国工农业生产建设更大跃进的需要。
    在过去的一年中，鞍钢各轧钢厂轧制的钢材，比过去任何一年都多，各种钢材的总产量比1957年提高31％，相当于1943年日伪统治时期最高年产量的七倍。从1958年1月到11月，只是重轨，就比1957年同时期增长十六万吨；优质钢材的产量，比1957年同时期增加了十倍。这一年中，各个轧钢厂还轧制成功了一百多种新的规格和新的品种的钢材。新产品中，有高强度的低合金钢板，有修筑桥梁、大型厂房用的高达一尺六寸多的巨型工字钢，有厚达三、四寸的钢板，也有细到可以作为注射针头的不锈钢管。这些新品种的钢材，都是过去我国没有轧制过的。
    鞍钢各轧钢厂在1958年轧制的大量钢材，在我国机械工业、交通运输业的大跃进和重要工程的建设中，发挥了巨大作用。现在，行驶在全国各地的“解放牌”汽车，从底盘到车架所用的各种钢材；即将竣工的乌江大桥所使用的各种桥梁钢；铁路修建中铺设的重轨等，大部分是鞍钢各轧钢厂轧制的。这一年中，各轧钢厂为洛阳、天津等地拖拉机厂，提供了许多制造拖拉机的钢材，并且还以一部分钢材支援了僮族、苗族等少数民族地区兴修小型水力发电站。这一年中，鞍钢只是支援上海一个市制造机械、电机和船只等用的钢材，就有二十多万吨。
    鞍钢各个轧钢厂的职工，都把支援全国工农业生产建设大跃进，看作是一项最光荣的任务。在1958年中，他们提出国家“要什么轧什么、要多少轧多少”的口号，想尽各种办法及时地轧制出各地急需的各种钢材。当各地铁路建设中急需铺设重轨的时候，担负全国重轨生产任务的大型轧钢厂职工，就大力改进操作技术，提高重轨的产量。1月至10月份，他们轧制出几十万吨重轨，及时地支援了铁路建设。10月份以后，职工们又设法使重轨的平均日产量比年初时提高了将近一倍，从而使全年重轨的产量比1957年增加了十几万吨。各地电机制造厂急需矽钢片时，第二薄板厂工人就想办法采取多片轧制法，把矽钢片的产量从原来的每班轧五千片提高到八千多片。按照设计要求，无缝钢管厂只能轧制直径三十八公厘到一百四十公厘的无缝钢管，但是工人们为了满足建设的需要，发扬了敢想敢干的精神，不仅试轧出直径一百六十八公厘的无缝钢管，并且在自制的冷拔机上将直径二十五公厘的不锈钢管拔成了毛细管和注射针头。五十五号工字钢是建筑大型厂房和桥梁等工程必需的钢材，而专门轧制大型钢材的大型轧钢厂，按照设计标准只能轧30号工字钢，因而过去各地使用的55号工字钢，不得不从国外进口。这一年，鞍钢初轧厂的职工和公司的研究人员紧密结合，大胆在初轧机上使用呻口轧辊轧出了异型钢坯，大型轧钢厂工人又用这个钢坯轧出了55号工字钢。各轧钢厂还轧制了高强度的低合金钢材。在机械制造、建筑工业上使用这种钢材，可以比一般炭素钢材节约15％到20％，并能延长机械和建筑物的寿命。现在，从首都的广播铁塔到西南、西北的石油钻井机架，从造船、汽车到化肥设备的制造中，都开始使用这种低合金钢材了。去年上半年，长春第一汽车制造厂试制东风牌小轿车时，鞍钢的轧钢厂就及时地轧成制造这种汽车用的钢板和冷拔钢管。大连造船厂建造我国第一艘万吨巨轮时，急需大型球平钢和厚钢板等，鞍钢大型轧钢厂和中板厂的工人，就及时把这种钢板轧制出来，满足了这个厂的需要。最近，大型轧钢厂还正在试轧可供一万二千吨大水压机作机座用的一百二十公厘厚的钢板。
    现在，各个轧钢厂为了实现今年“高质量、多品种”的要求，正在组织广大职工结合学习中共八届六中全会文件，总结去年生产大跃进的经验。各个轧钢厂还安排了1月份的生产计划，及早组织力量检修机械设备，加强安全生产的措施，建立产品质量检验制度，大力组织备品、配件的生产，以便把今年的生产计划建立在充分可靠的物质基础上。
