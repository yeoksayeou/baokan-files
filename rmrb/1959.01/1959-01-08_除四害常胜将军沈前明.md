    Shen Qianming, Ever-Victorious General in the Elimination of Four Pests
    By our reporter, Sun Yuedong
    In the large and small market towns and vast rural areas of Peng'an County, Sichuan Province, everyone knows Shen Qianming. People call him "Four Pests Elimination Expert" and "Ever-Victorious General in the Elimination of Four Pests."
    Every noon or evening, when people are resting, a team of dozens of people sets out from Lingjiang Town, Peng'an County. They carry baskets on their backs, ladders on their shoulders, meat scraps and bones in their hands, and tin cans. This is the Four Pests Elimination Commando led by Shen Qianming. In the afternoon or the next morning, when people are just starting to work, they return victoriously with buckets of rats and strings of sparrows, never empty-handed. They take turns operating in the residential sections of various market towns or production teams of communes, covering almost the entire county. Shen Qianming himself, from 1952 to the present, has not relaxed his work in eliminating the four pests for six years. In these six years, he has killed a total of more than 20,700 rats and more than 91,000 sparrows in his spare time. As for the mosquitoes and flies he has killed, they are countless. In the past year alone, he dug out forty catties of fly pupae.
    Shen Qianming is a handyman at the People's Hospital of Lingjiang Town, Peng'an County. He is diligent and willing to learn. In addition to his work, he has learned techniques such as giving injections, applying dressings, and delivering babies, and has been rated as a model worker by the hospital. After realizing the significance of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, he actively participated in this work and has been repeatedly rated as an A-grade and special-grade hygiene model by the county and Nanchong Special District, receiving five awards. In September of last year, he attended the National Experience Exchange Conference on Medical and Health Technology Revolution held in Beijing and was hired as a special researcher at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and a consultant at the Beijing Anti-epidemic Station. Not long ago, he was also selected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Production and Patriotic Health.
    Shen Qianming is known as the "Four Pests Elimination Expert" not only because he has eliminated a large number of "four pests," but also because he is extremely familiar with the habits of rats and sparrows and has mastered the laws of their activities, thereby creating a series of different methods of capture and killing. When he discovered that rats have the characteristic of inviting each other to steal food, he further improved the original methods of using basins and leaky jars, changing the bait from being scattered only inside to being scattered in a nearby area. In this way, after the first rat ate the bait, it would go back and invite another one. Rat after rat would invite each other, and when a group of rats ate the bait in the middle, what was caught was no longer one, but a group.
    Because Shen Qianming is willing to observe carefully, he can judge what kind of rat it is based on the rat holes and the things that have been gnawed; when a rat jumps and runs away, he can judge whether the rat has gone to the hillside to eat crops or to the toilet to eat feces. Once, a farmer asked him: Why don't rats come to eat the food after putting up a rat trap? After Shen Qianming investigated in his house, he said that the rats came in through the window every night; according to the habits of rats, after entering the house, they do not immediately go to the place where there is food, but always run around the house for most of a circle, and generally from right to left, listening for movement, so although the rat trap is not far from the window, it is not placed on the aisle, so the rat does not go to eat. The farmer changed the position of the rat trap according to his words, and the next day he caught a rat.
    When catching sparrows, Shen Qianming also first studied the time and place of sparrow reproduction, the places where sparrows often roost at night, and their habits. He said that sparrows like to breed on the leeward and sunny roofs, and like to gather on one roof; they breed from March to August every year, laying a nest of eggs every twenty days. He can tell whether there are eggs, chicks, or empty nests inside just by looking at the grass at the entrance of the nest. Therefore, he has a certain destination for picking up sparrow eggs and chicks, and he can always catch dozens to hundreds of them at a time (including eggs).
    At first, Shen Qianming was working alone. As long as he heard that sparrows and rats were rampant somewhere, he would rush over. In February 1952 alone, he killed 8,000 rats. When the county awarded prizes at the beginning of the second year, he received a red flag. Later, Chen Zhengshan, the secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Lingjiang Town, said to him: "Old Shen, you only have one head and two hands, and you can only do so much; if you want to achieve greater results, you can only mobilize everyone to work together!" This enlightened Shen Qianming.
    At that time, the masses in Peng'an County had not used rat traps, some did not know how to use them, and some did not believe that rat traps could catch rats, so few people bought them. Shen Qianming lent his dozens of rat traps to everyone and taught them how to use them. He also taught the masses simple methods such as using wooden basins and leaky jars, and told them how to catch more. As a result, nearly a thousand rats were caught in the first round in the town. At this point, Shen Qianming's rat-catching methods began to spread nearby.
    Last year, Shen Qianming traveled to twelve counties and cities in Nanchong Special District, demonstrating and teaching techniques on the spot. Many young people worshipped him as their teacher and learned from him. He also organized dozens of apprentices in the county into a Four Pests Elimination Commando, using all sixty yuan of prize money he had received twice to buy tools and medicines, and led them to various places to wipe out the four pests in their spare time. Not long ago, he came to Beijing to attend a meeting, and he also carried medicines with him, preparing to use them when he encountered sparrows on the road. When I asked him why he was so enthusiastic, he said: "Now that people's lives have improved, we must not allow these bad things, the four pests, to continue to harm us."

    除四害常胜将军沈前明
    本报记者　孙跃冬
    四川省蓬安县的大小场镇和广大农村里，一提起沈前明，无人不知，谁人不晓。人们称他为“除四害专家”“除四害常胜将军”。
    每天中午或傍晚，当人们休息的时候，蓬安县陵江镇有一支数十人的队伍就出动了。他们背着背兜，扛着梯子，提着肉皮和骨头，拿着洋铁筒，这就是沈前明领导的除四害突击队。下午或第二天清晨，当人们刚开始工作的时候，他们就提着一桶桶的老鼠，一串串的麻雀胜利而归，从不空手。他们就是这样轮流到各场镇的居民段或公社的生产队去活动，几乎把全县都跑遍了。而沈前明自己，从1952年到现在，六年如一日，一直没有放松除四害的工作。六年中，他利用业余时间共杀死老鼠二万零七百多只，麻雀九万一千多只。至于他杀灭的蚊蝇就不计其数了，仅去年一年，他掘出的蝇蛹就有四十斤。
    沈前明是蓬安县陵江镇人民医院的勤杂工人。他很勤快，又肯学习。工作之外，他学会了打针、敷药、接生等技术，被医院评为模范工作者。当他认识到除四害讲卫生的意义之后，便积极参加了这项工作，曾多次被县和南充专区评选为甲级和特等卫生模范，受到五次奖励。去年9月，他出席了在北京举行的全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会，并被聘为中国医学科学院的特约研究员和北京防疫站顾问。不久前，他又被选为出席全国农业生产及爱国卫生先进单位代表大会的代表。
    沈前明被人们称为“除四害专家”，不仅因为他消灭“四害”的数量多，而且还因为他极熟悉老鼠、麻雀的习性，掌握了它们活动的规律，从而创造出一系列不同的捕杀方法。当他发现老鼠有爱互相邀约偷食的特点，就把原来用盆子扣、用坛子漏的方法，进一步改进了一下，把只撒在里面的饵食，改撒在附近的一片地方。这样，第一只老鼠吃了饵食以后，便回去约另一只。只只相约，等到一群老鼠吃到中间的饵食时，捉到的就不再是一只，而是一群了。
    由于沈前明肯于细心观察，因此他能根据鼠洞和被啃咬的东西，判断出是那种老鼠；当老鼠跳跑时，他会判断出老鼠是到坡里吃庄稼去了，或到厕所里吃粪去了。有一次，一个农民问他：为什么放上打鼠板，老鼠却不来吃食？沈前明到他的屋里侦察以后说，老鼠是每天夜里从窗上进来的；按照老鼠的习性，它进屋后，并不立即到有吃食的地方，而总是要绕屋跑大半圈，并且一般是从右向左，听听动静，因此打鼠板虽然放得离窗户不远，但是没有放在过道上，老鼠就不去吃。那个农民按照他的话，把打鼠板改换了一下位置，第二天果然打到了老鼠。
    捉麻雀时，沈前明也是先研究出麻雀繁殖的时间、地点，麻雀晚上常栖的地方和习性。他说，麻雀爱在背风向阳的房顶上繁殖，而且爱聚在一个房顶上；每年3月到8月繁殖，每二十天就生一窝蛋。他只要看看窝门口的草，就能知道里面是蛋，是小雀、还是空窝。因此，他掏雀蛋和小雀，有一定的去处，而且一次总是能捉数十只到一百多只（包括蛋）。
    开始时，沈前明是单枪独马一人单干。只要他听到说那里麻雀、老鼠猖獗，就赶了上去。只1952年2月一个月，他就杀死老鼠八千只。第二年初县上评奖时，他得到一面红旗。后来，中共陵江镇总支书记陈正三对他说：“老沈呵，你不过一个脑袋两只手，搞得也有限；要想取得更大的成绩，只有发动大家一齐干！”这一下，沈前明的脑筋开了窍。
    那时候，蓬安县的群众还没有用过打鼠板，有的不会用，有的不相信打鼠板能打住老鼠，买的人少。沈前明就把自己买的数十个打鼠板借给大家，并教给他们使用的方法。他又把用木盆扣，用坛子漏等简便方法教给群众，告诉他们怎样才扣得多。结果全镇在第一轮次，就捉鼠近一千只。这一下，沈前明的捉老鼠方法，就开始在附近推广开了。
    去年，沈前明走遍了南充专区十二个县市，当场表演传授技术，许多青年人都拜他为师，跟他学习。他又把本县的数十个徒弟组织成一支除四害突击队，把两次领到的六十元奖金，全部拿来买成工具、药品，利用业余时间带领他们到各处歼灭四害。不久前，他来北京开会，还随身带着药品，准备路上遇见麻雀时使用。当我问他为什么干劲这样大时，他说：“现在人民生活过好了，决不能容许四害这些坏东西继续为害。
