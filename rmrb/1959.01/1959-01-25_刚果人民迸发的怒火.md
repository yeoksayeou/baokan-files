The Bursting Anger of the Congolese People
Lu Ying

"Congo, land of our ancestors, we will fight for your freedom, even if blood flows like a river."

These are the opening lines of a currently popular song among the Congolese people, and it sings out the heartfelt voice of the Congolese people. Although this song, which fully expresses the Congolese people's surging enthusiasm and firm will to strive for independence and freedom, has been banned by the colonial authorities, the colonists cannot suppress the anger in the hearts of the Congolese people.

The bloody struggle in Leopoldville is a burst of the Congolese people's anger.

So-called "Civilizing Mission"

The roar of the Congolese people has shaken the West and exposed the lies and shamelessness of the colonialists.

Belgian colonialists have always boasted that they are "ideal" imperialists, saying that the Congo is a "paradise for black Africans" under their rule. They try to prove that exploiting 13 million Congolese people is a "great civilizing mission" of Belgium. Some Western figures who chimed in with the colonialists said, "Among the colonial countries, only Belgium has mastered the secret of governing satisfactory colonies."

However, facts speak louder than eloquence. No matter how hard they try to distort and fabricate, the truth cannot be erased. Belgian colonialists are birds of a feather with other colonialists, and the fate of the Congolese people is the same as that of other colonial peoples, what they get is shackles, ignorance, disease, and hunger.

When the clutches of the Belgian rulers stretched into the Congo in 1885, whose territory was 76 times the size of Belgium, the most brutal crimes occurred in the atrocities that colonial countries had ever brought about in "developing" a primitive area. At that time, the main treasures of the Congo were rubber and ivory. The appetite of King Leopold II of Belgium's agents for these two things was insatiable. They forced African workers to complete quotas, and if the rubber and ivory delivered did not reach the required amount, they would be punished by amputation or execution. During the period of Belgian rule, the Congolese population decreased from 30 million to 13 million, and during Leopold's rule alone, 5 million to 8 million lives were lost. What a heinous "development"! This is the "paradise"!

Belgium ruled through the colonial government, monopoly capital, and the Catholic Church stationed in the Congo. The Governors of the Congo were almost without exception promoted from colonial officials. For a long time, they fundamentally deprived the Congolese people of all rights, without elections, without political parties, and did not even consider establishing a deceptive legislative assembly. It was not until December 1957 that the Belgian colonial authorities were forced to hold municipal elections in the three cities of Leopoldville, Jadotville, and Elisabethville to whitewash colonial rule.

The Catholic Church is also a powerful tool for Belgium to control the Congo. There are currently more than 6,000 churches in the Congo, which play a role from cities to villages. The most important influence of Catholicism is in education, and education in the Congo is almost monopolized by missionary groups.

Belgian monopoly capital, the "Belgian General Bank," the "Brussels Bank," the "Empain Bank," and the "Cominière Bank," four financial oligarchs, control the economy of the Congo and carry out cruel exploitation. The taxes paid by the Katanga Mining Union alone account for almost half of the Belgian colonial authorities' annual revenue. This company has become one of the world's 100 largest concerns, and it has become the overlord of the Congo. Belgian monopoly companies carry out some social service undertakings to win over workers and do not allow workers to organize trade unions.

In the Congo, racial discrimination and political oppression are outrageous. In some important cities in the Congo, such as Leopoldville and Elisabethville, they are composed of two districts, one is the black district, and the other is the white district. African blacks cannot pass without a pass.

The cultural education of the Congo is extremely backward. Africans are allowed to receive vocational education, but only to a certain limit, and this limit is very strange. A Congolese black can become a carpenter or technician, but not an engineer. He can be a bishop or pharmacist, but not an architect or lawyer. Belgians try as much as possible not to let Congolese people go to Europe, especially to Belgium. The barrier between the two countries is almost an impassable chasm. If a Congolese sailor manages to escape from his ship in a Belgian seaport, he will be forced to stay in Belgium for life, making it impossible for him to return to the Congo and tell people everything he has seen.

This is the "great civilizing mission" carried out by the "ideal" Belgian colonialists in the Congo.

The Lie About "Welfare"

In a panic, the colonialists insisted that Belgian colonial rule had made the 13 million enslaved people of the Congo "very fortunate in economic and social terms," and that the reason why the Congolese people could not bear it was because they were "forbidden to eat the fruit of the tree of political knowledge." It means that the Congolese people who are not politically free have a "fortunate" life.

Belgian colonialists said in the tone of slave owners: "If there is no bread, political rights are worthless, let us give them bread first!" They have been propagating how generous "welfare" they have given to the Congolese people. But please take a look at this lie that covers up endless plunder.

According to the materials of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee, in 1956, the Belgian Congo allocated 55.8 million francs (the monetary unit of the Belgian Congo is the Belgian Congo franc, which can be exchanged for the Belgian franc, equivalent to two cents in US dollars) for "native welfare funds," while ordinary expenses and special expenses amounted to 1.7 billion francs. However, the total funds and reserves of the 500 Belgian companies in the Congo amounted to more than 50 billion francs, and the profit in 1957 was more than 10.5 billion francs. That is to say, the "welfare funds" spent by the Belgian colonialists were only a fraction of the profits they plundered from the Congo.

Let's take a look at the "Mining Union Company," the largest monopoly organization in the Belgian Congo, which boasts of "constantly expanding the scale of its welfare measures." According to reports, this company has 92,000 people living in 20,000 houses, six hospitals with more than 1,500 beds, and schools where 17,000 Congolese children study. However, there are more than 26,000 indigenous workers exploited in this company, accounting for 22% of the population of the industrial center of the Congo. However, this company with no more than 5 billion francs of capital has obtained 28 billion francs of profit in the six years from 1950 to 1955, that is, about 5 billion francs per year. Here, how much "welfare" did the colonialist vampires make from the huge profits plundered from the Congo!

From the life of the entire Congolese people, we can see through the shameful and hypocritical propaganda of the colonialists.

Due to the increasingly large-scale exploitation of the rich treasures of the Congo by the colonialists, the socio-economic life of the Congo has undergone great changes. A large number of farmers were driven into cities and mines to do hard labor, the working class is quite numerous, and some modern cities have been established. It is estimated that 23% of the total population of the Congo live in urban areas, and 38% of all adult men live on wages. 42% of the Congolese people are literate.

However, the Congolese people's miserable life of poverty, disease, and death has only increased.

The Belgian "Late News" reported: There are more than 50,000 unemployed people in Leopoldville alone. These unemployed people cannot get any relief money. The colonial authorities and bosses are trying their best to drive them into the jungle.

An article published by the Social Research Institute of the Private University of Brussels admitted that the Belgian colonial authorities refused to increase the extremely low wages of indigenous workers on the pretext that blacks were "accustomed to malnutrition." Indigenous workers cannot get enough to eat, their physical strength is insufficient, and they often cannot reach the required productivity. The health of the indigenous people is very bad, diseases are prevalent, and malnutrition is the root cause of health problems. However, there are no doctors in vast areas. In the Giri area with 45,000 residents, there are only two clinics in total, each with only one health worker. Many indigenous people die due to lack of the most basic treatment, and infant mortality and miscarriage reach a terrible level.

This is the serious consequence of the "policy" of the Belgian colonial authorities which flaunt "providing sufficient wages and benefits to ensure a better standard of living."

The Flame of Freedom Burns More and More Fiercely

The Congolese people have never succumbed. They had already risen up to fight the colonialists in the earliest period when their country was enslaved by colonialism. In the eighty years of colonialist enslavement, several major uprisings have broken out in the Congo. In 1896, the residents of the Montali area near Lake Leopold had held an uprising against the Belgian aggressors. The great October Socialist Revolution began the revolutionary awakening of the peoples of the colonies and dependent countries. The salute of the "Aurora" also resounded to the various ethnic groups of the Belgian Congo. Between 1921, 1926-1927, and 1931, mass struggles of the Congolese people against imperialism took place. In particular, the peasant uprising that broke out in the Lulua and Ubangi regions in the autumn of 1931 lasted for several months.

During the Second World War, the revolutionary struggle of the various ethnic groups of the Congo began to grow again. In December 1941, the employees of the Katanga United Mining Company in Lubumbashi held a strike, demanding an increase in wages; in 1944, the African soldiers stationed in Lulabourg held an uprising, and local residents also participated. In the same year, an armed uprising of workers also occurred in Masusi-Lubudo.

In the past ten years or so, the Congolese national liberation movement has taken a further step. The general strike at the port of Matadi in November 1945 was the first shot after the war. The strikers once occupied the main positions in the city, and it took the colonial authorities' army several days to suppress the uprising. Congolese laborers won the right to establish trade union organizations in 1946, and Belgian monopoly capitalists were forced to allow the establishment of trade unions under the pressure of labor struggles. Representatives of the Congolese General Labor Union, which has 800,000 members, participated in the Pan-African Trade Union Congress held in Dakar in April 1947. This conference called for the independence and political and economic rights of African countries. A peasant uprising broke out in the Eastern Province in 1946. Peasants in the Equateur Province also carried out an uprising in 1947. From 1949 to 1950, African miners launched a powerful movement to fight for political freedom and increase wages. In February 1952, a major strike of employees broke out in the capital of the Congo. This strike forced the colonial authorities to make certain concessions to the workers for the first time.

Now, more than 10 million Congolese people have been involved in the torrent that is stirring Africa and shaking the colonial system.

The flame of striving for independence and freedom is burning more and more fiercely. The struggle of the Congolese people has aroused cheers from all righteous human beings, but it has been cursed by Belgium and all colonialists. The British "Observer" commented on the Leopoldville incident with these words: "The poisonous snake of African nationalism has entered the garden, and it is clear that it is impossible to drive it away." There are indeed poisonous snakes in the rich and beautiful garden of the Congo, and this is Belgian colonialism supported by the United States. The Congolese people must become the masters of their own garden, and the colonialist poisonous snakes will not leave if they do not leave. (Attached pictures)

    刚果人民迸发的怒火
    鲁映
    “刚果哟，我们祖先的国土，我们将为你的自由而斗争，即使血流成河也要斗争。”
    这是刚果人民目前流行的歌曲中开头的几句，它唱出了刚果人民的心声。虽然这支充分流露刚果人民争取独立自由的磅礴热情和坚强意志的歌曲，被殖民当局所禁止，但是殖民者无法抑阻刚果人民心中的怒火。
    利奥波德维尔的流血斗争就是刚果人民怒火的一次迸发。
    如此“文明使命”
    刚果人民的一声怒吼，震动了西方，揭穿了殖民主义者的谎言与无耻。
    比利时殖民者一向吹嘘它自己是“理想的”帝国主义，说刚果是在它统治下的“非洲黑人的乐园”，他们力图证明对一千三百万刚果人民进行剥削是比利时的一项“伟大的文明使命”。为殖民者帮腔的一些西方人物说，“在殖民国家中间只有比利时掌握了治理满意的殖民地的秘密”。
    但是，事实胜于雄辩，不管他们如何竭尽歪曲和捏造之能事，真相是抹煞不了的。比利时殖民者同其它殖民者是一丘之貉，而刚果人民的命运也和其它殖民地人民一样，得到的是镣铐、愚昧、疾病和饥饿。
    比利时统治者的魔掌从1885年伸入领土相当于比利时七十六倍的刚果时，就发生了殖民国家在“开发”一个原始地区所曾带来的暴行中最残暴的罪行。在当时，刚果主要宝物是橡胶和象牙。比利时国王利奥波尔二世的代理人对这两样东西的胃口是永无餍止的。他们强迫非洲工人完成定额，如果交纳的橡胶和象牙没有达到所需要的数量就要受到截肢或枪决的惩罚。在比利时统治期间，刚果人民由三千万减少到一千三百万，而在利奥波尔的统治期间就葬送了五百万到八百万人的生命，这是一种多么令人发指的“开发”！这就是“乐园”！
    比利时通过驻刚果的殖民政府、垄断资本和天主教进行统治。驻刚果总督差不多毫不例外地都是从殖民官员中擢升起来的。它们长期来根本剥夺刚果人民的一切权利，没有选举，没有政党，连成立骗人的立法议会也不加考虑。直到1957年12月，比利时殖民当局才被迫在利奥波德维尔、贾多特维尔和伊利沙伯维尔三个城市举行粉饰殖民统治的市政选举。
    天主教也是比利时控制刚果的得力工具。刚果目前有六千多教堂，从城市到乡村都发挥着作用。天主教最主要的势力是在教育方面，刚果的教育几乎是由传教团体垄断的。
    比利时垄断资本，“比利时通用银行”、“布鲁塞尔银行”、“艾姆平银行”和“科明埃尔银行”四个金融寡头支配着刚果的经济，进行残酷的榨取。仅仅卡刚达矿业联合公司所交的税款就几乎占比利时殖民当局每年收入的一半。这家公司成了世界上一百家大康采恩之中的一个，它成了刚果的太上皇。比利时垄断公司开展一些社会服务事业笼络工人，不准工人组织工会。
    在刚果，种族歧视和政治压迫令人发指。在刚果的一些重要城市如利奥波德维尔和伊利沙伯维尔，都是由两个区组成的，一个是黑人区，另一个是白人区，非洲黑人没有通行证是不能通行的。
    刚果的文化教育是极端落后的，非洲人被允许受职业教育，但只受到一定限度为止，这个限度是很奇怪的。一个刚果黑人可以成为木匠或技工，但不能成为工程师。他可以做主教或药剂师，但不能做建筑师和律师。比利时人尽可能不让刚果人到欧洲去特别是到比利时去。两国之间的障壁几乎是不可飞渡的天堑。如果有一个刚果海员在比利时海港设法逃离了他的船，他就会被迫终生留在比利时，使他不可能回到刚果把他所看到的一切告诉人们。
    这就是“理想”的比利时殖民者在刚果执行的“伟大的文明的使命”。
    关于“福利”的谎言
    殖民主义者在惊慌失措之余，硬说比利时的殖民统治怎样使刚果一千三百万被奴役的人民“在经济和社会方面很幸运”，而刚果人民所以不能忍受下去，是因为他们“被禁止去吃政治知识之树的果子”。意思是说，政治上不自由的刚果人民却有了“幸运”的生活。
    比利时殖民者俨然以奴隶主的口吻说：“如果没有面包，政治权利便毫无价值，让我们先给他们面包吧！”他们一直宣扬他们给了刚果人民何等优厚的“福利”。但请看看这种掩盖无止境掠夺的谎言吧。
    据联合国托管委员会的材料，比属刚果1956年拨出了五千五百八十万法郎（比属刚果的货币单位是比属刚果法郎，它同比利时法郎可以兑换，合美元二分）的“土著福利金”，而普通经费和特别经费却达十七亿法郎。但比利时在刚果的五百家公司的资金和预备金的总额达五百多亿法郎，1957年的利润达一百零五亿多法郎。这就是说，比利时殖民者所花的“福利金”，不过是它从刚果掠夺的利润的一个零头。
    再看看比利时在刚果的最大垄断组织“矿业联合公司”吹嘘的“经常扩大它的福利措施规模”。据报道，这个公司有九万二千人住在两万所住宅里，有一千五百多张病床的六个医院和一万七千刚果小孩念书的学校，而在这家公司里受剥削的土著工人达两万六千名以上，占刚果工业中心人口的22％。但是这家不超过五十亿法郎资本的公司，却从1950年到1955年的六年内获得了二百八十亿法郎的利润，即每年约得五十亿法郎。在这里，殖民主义吸血鬼又从刚果掠夺的巨额利润中作了多少“福利”！
    从整个刚果人民的生活中，更能看穿殖民主义者可耻的虚伪宣传。
    由于殖民主义者日益大规模榨取刚果的丰富宝藏，刚果社会经济生活已经发生了很大的变化。大批的农民被赶入城市矿山作苦役，工人阶级为数颇众，一些现代城市建立了起来。据估计，在刚果全部人口中，有23％的人住在城市地区，全部成年男人的38％靠工资生活。刚果人民当中识字的占42％。
    但是，刚果人民贫困、疾病、死亡的灾难生活，有加无已。
    比利时“晚报”报道：单在利奥波德维尔就有五万多失业者，这些失业者得不到任何救济金，殖民当局和老板竭力把他们赶到丛林中去。
    布鲁塞尔私立大学社会研究所发表的文章承认，比利时殖民当局借口黑人“惯于营养不足”，拒绝提高土著工人的极低工资。土著工人吃不饱，体力不足，常常不能达到所要求的生产率。土著居民的健康情况很坏，疾病流行，而营养不足是健康问题的根源。但广大地区没有医生，在四万五千居民的吉里地区总共只有两个医务所，每处只有一个卫生人员，许多土著因缺乏最基本的治疗而死去，婴儿死亡率和流产达到可怕的程度。
    这就是比利时殖民当局标榜的“提供足够的工资和福利，以便保证较好的生活水平”的“政策”的严重后果。
    自由火焰越烧越炽
    刚果人民从来没有屈服。他们早在他们的国家受殖民主义奴役的最初时期，即已奋起同殖民者进行斗争。在殖民主义奴役的八十年中，刚果爆发过几次大起义。1896年，利奥波尔湖附近的蒙塔利区的居民，就曾经举行过反对比利时侵略者的起义。伟大的十月社会主义革命开始了殖民地与附属国各国人民的革命觉醒。“阿芙乐尔”号的礼炮也震响到比属刚果的各族人民那里。1921、1926—1927年间和1931年，都发生了刚果人民反对帝国主义的群众斗争。特别是1931年秋在鲁隆和乌班吉地区爆发的农民起义，延续达数月之久。
    在第二次大战期间，刚果各族人民的革命斗争又开始增长起来了。1941年12月在卢布姆巴希的加丹加联合矿业公司的职工，举行罢工，要求增加工资；1944年驻防在刘利亚堡的非洲士兵，举行过起义，当地居民也参加了。同年，在马苏西—卢布多还发生了一次工人的武装起义。
    近十多年来，刚果民族解放运动更进了一步。1945年11月马塔迪港口的总罢工，是战后第一声响炮。罢工者一度占领了市内的主要阵地，殖民当局的军队经过好几天才将起义镇压下去。刚果劳动者在1946年已争得了建立工会组织的权利，比利时垄断资本家在劳动者斗争的压力下被迫准许成立工会。拥有八十万会员的刚果总工会的代表，参加了1947年4月在达喀尔举行的全非工会代表大会。这次大会号召争取非洲各国的独立和政治经济权利。1946年东方省爆发了一次农民起义。赤道省的农民也于1947年实行起义。1949—1950年非洲籍矿工发动了争取政治自由和提高工资的强大运动。1952年2月，在刚果首府爆发了职工大罢工，这次罢工迫使殖民当局第一次对工人作了某些让步。
    现在，一千多万刚果人民卷入了激荡着非洲、震撼着殖民制度的洪流中了。
    争取独立自由的火焰越烧越炽烈。刚果人民的斗争，引起了一切正义人类的欢呼，但受到了比利时和所有殖民者的咒诅。英国“观察家报”是用这样的话评论利奥波德维尔事件的：“非洲民族主义的毒蛇已经进入花园，很明显要赶走它是赶不了的”。富饶美丽的刚果花园里确有毒蛇，这就是美国支持下的比利时殖民主义。刚果人民一定要成为自己花园的主人，殖民主义毒蛇不走是不行的。（附图片）
