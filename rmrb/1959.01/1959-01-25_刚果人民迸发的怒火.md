The Bursting Anger of the Congolese People
Lu Ying

"Congo, land of our ancestors, we will fight for your freedom, even if blood flows like a river."

These are the opening lines of a currently popular song among the Congolese people, and it sings out the heartfelt voice of the Congolese people. Although this song, which fully expresses the Congolese people's surging enthusiasm and firm will to strive for independence and freedom, has been banned by the colonial authorities, the colonists cannot suppress the anger in the hearts of the Congolese people.

The bloody struggle in Leopoldville is a burst of the Congolese people's anger.

So-called "Civilizing Mission"

The roar of the Congolese people has shaken the West and exposed the lies and shamelessness of the colonialists.

Belgian colonialists have always boasted that they are "ideal" imperialists, saying that the Congo is a "paradise for black Africans" under their rule. They try to prove that exploiting 13 million Congolese people is a "great civilizing mission" of Belgium. Some Western figures who chimed in with the colonialists said, "Among the colonial countries, only Belgium has mastered the secret of governing satisfactory colonies."

However, facts speak louder than eloquence. No matter how hard they try to distort and fabricate, the truth cannot be erased. Belgian colonialists are birds of a feather with other colonialists, and the fate of the Congolese people is the same as that of other colonial peoples, what they get is shackles, ignorance, disease, and hunger.

When the clutches of the Belgian rulers stretched into the Congo in 1885, whose territory was 76 times the size of Belgium, the most brutal crimes occurred in the atrocities that colonial countries had ever brought about in "developing" a primitive area. At that time, the main treasures of the Congo were rubber and ivory. The appetite of King Leopold II of Belgium's agents for these two things was insatiable. They forced African workers to complete quotas, and if the rubber and ivory delivered did not reach the required amount, they would be punished by amputation or execution. During the period of Belgian rule, the Congolese population decreased from 30 million to 13 million, and during Leopold's rule alone, 5 million to 8 million lives were lost. What a heinous "development"! This is the "paradise"!

Belgium ruled through the colonial government, monopoly capital, and the Catholic Church stationed in the Congo. The Governors of the Congo were almost without exception promoted from colonial officials. For a long time, they fundamentally deprived the Congolese people of all rights, without elections, without political parties, and did not even consider establishing a deceptive legislative assembly. It was not until December 1957 that the Belgian colonial authorities were forced to hold municipal elections in the three cities of Leopoldville, Jadotville, and Elisabethville to whitewash colonial rule.

The Catholic Church is also a powerful tool for Belgium to control the Congo. There are currently more than 6,000 churches in the Congo, which play a role from cities to villages. The most important influence of Catholicism is in education, and education in the Congo is almost monopolized by missionary groups.

Belgian monopoly capital, the "Belgian General Bank," the "Brussels Bank," the "Empain Bank," and the "Comini√®re Bank," four financial oligarchs, control the economy of the Congo and carry out cruel exploitation. The taxes paid by the Katanga Mining Union alone account for almost half of the Belgian colonial authorities' annual revenue. This company has become one of the world's 100 largest concerns, and it has become the overlord of the Congo. Belgian monopoly companies carry out some social service undertakings to win over workers and do not allow workers to organize trade unions.

In the Congo, racial discrimination and political oppression are outrageous. In some important cities in the Congo, such as Leopoldville and Elisabethville, they are composed of two districts, one is the black district, and the other is the white district. African blacks cannot pass without a pass.

The cultural education of the Congo is extremely backward. Africans are allowed to receive vocational education, but only to a certain limit, and this limit is very strange. A Congolese black can become a carpenter or technician, but not an engineer. He can be a bishop or pharmacist, but not an architect or lawyer. Belgians try as much as possible not to let Congolese people go to Europe, especially to Belgium. The barrier between the two countries is almost an impassable chasm. If a Congolese sailor manages to escape from his ship in a Belgian seaport, he will be forced to stay in Belgium for life, making it impossible for him to return to the Congo and tell people everything he has seen.

This is the "great civilizing mission" carried out by the "ideal" Belgian colonialists in the Congo.

The Lie About "Welfare"

In a panic, the colonialists insisted that Belgian colonial rule had made the 13 million enslaved people of the Congo "very fortunate in economic and social terms," and that the reason why the Congolese people could not bear it was because they were "forbidden to eat the fruit of the tree of political knowledge." It means that the Congolese people who are not politically free have a "fortunate" life.

Belgian colonialists said in the tone of slave owners: "If there is no bread, political rights are worthless, let us give them bread first!" They have been propagating how generous "welfare" they have given to the Congolese people. But please take a look at this lie that covers up endless plunder.

According to the materials of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee, in 1956, the Belgian Congo allocated 55.8 million francs (the monetary unit of the Belgian Congo is the Belgian Congo franc, which can be exchanged for the Belgian franc, equivalent to two cents in US dollars) for "native welfare funds," while ordinary expenses and special expenses amounted to 1.7 billion francs. However, the total funds and reserves of the 500 Belgian companies in the Congo amounted to more than 50 billion francs, and the profit in 1957 was more than 10.5 billion francs. That is to say, the "welfare funds" spent by the Belgian colonialists were only a fraction of the profits they plundered from the Congo.

Let's take a look at the "Mining Union Company," the largest monopoly organization in the Belgian Congo, which boasts of "constantly expanding the scale of its welfare measures." According to reports, this company has 92,000 people living in 20,000 houses, six hospitals with more than 1,500 beds, and schools where 17,000 Congolese children study. However, there are more than 26,000 indigenous workers exploited in this company, accounting for 22% of the population of the industrial center of the Congo. However, this company with no more than 5 billion francs of capital has obtained 28 billion francs of profit in the six years from 1950 to 1955, that is, about 5 billion francs per year. Here, how much "welfare" did the colonialist vampires make from the huge profits plundered from the Congo!

From the life of the entire Congolese people, we can see through the shameful and hypocritical propaganda of the colonialists.

Due to the increasingly large-scale exploitation of the rich treasures of the Congo by the colonialists, the socio-economic life of the Congo has undergone great changes. A large number of farmers were driven into cities and mines to do hard labor, the working class is quite numerous, and some modern cities have been established. It is estimated that 23% of the total population of the Congo live in urban areas, and 38% of all adult men live on wages. 42% of the Congolese people are literate.

However, the Congolese people's miserable life of poverty, disease, and death has only increased.

The Belgian "Late News" reported: There are more than 50,000 unemployed people in Leopoldville alone. These unemployed people cannot get any relief money. The colonial authorities and bosses are trying their best to drive them into the jungle.

An article published by the Social Research Institute of the Private University of Brussels admitted that the Belgian colonial authorities refused to increase the extremely low wages of indigenous workers on the pretext that blacks were "accustomed to malnutrition." Indigenous workers cannot get enough to eat, their physical strength is insufficient, and they often cannot reach the required productivity. The health of the indigenous people is very bad, diseases are prevalent, and malnutrition is the root cause of health problems. However, there are no doctors in vast areas. In the Giri area with 45,000 residents, there are only two clinics in total, each with only one health worker. Many indigenous people die due to lack of the most basic treatment, and infant mortality and miscarriage reach a terrible level.

This is the serious consequence of the "policy" of the Belgian colonial authorities which flaunt "providing sufficient wages and benefits to ensure a better standard of living."

The Flame of Freedom Burns More and More Fiercely

The Congolese people have never succumbed. They had already risen up to fight the colonialists in the earliest period when their country was enslaved by colonialism. In the eighty years of colonialist enslavement, several major uprisings have broken out in the Congo. In 1896, the residents of the Montali area near Lake Leopold had held an uprising against the Belgian aggressors. The great October Socialist Revolution began the revolutionary awakening of the peoples of the colonies and dependent countries. The salute of the "Aurora" also resounded to the various ethnic groups of the Belgian Congo. Between 1921, 1926-1927, and 1931, mass struggles of the Congolese people against imperialism took place. In particular, the peasant uprising that broke out in the Lulua and Ubangi regions in the autumn of 1931 lasted for several months.

During the Second World War, the revolutionary struggle of the various ethnic groups of the Congo began to grow again. In December 1941, the employees of the Katanga United Mining Company in Lubumbashi held a strike, demanding an increase in wages; in 1944, the African soldiers stationed in Lulabourg held an uprising, and local residents also participated. In the same year, an armed uprising of workers also occurred in Masusi-Lubudo.

In the past ten years or so, the Congolese national liberation movement has taken a further step. The general strike at the port of Matadi in November 1945 was the first shot after the war. The strikers once occupied the main positions in the city, and it took the colonial authorities' army several days to suppress the uprising. Congolese laborers won the right to establish trade union organizations in 1946, and Belgian monopoly capitalists were forced to allow the establishment of trade unions under the pressure of labor struggles. Representatives of the Congolese General Labor Union, which has 800,000 members, participated in the Pan-African Trade Union Congress held in Dakar in April 1947. This conference called for the independence and political and economic rights of African countries. A peasant uprising broke out in the Eastern Province in 1946. Peasants in the Equateur Province also carried out an uprising in 1947. From 1949 to 1950, African miners launched a powerful movement to fight for political freedom and increase wages. In February 1952, a major strike of employees broke out in the capital of the Congo. This strike forced the colonial authorities to make certain concessions to the workers for the first time.

Now, more than 10 million Congolese people have been involved in the torrent that is stirring Africa and shaking the colonial system.

The flame of striving for independence and freedom is burning more and more fiercely. The struggle of the Congolese people has aroused cheers from all righteous human beings, but it has been cursed by Belgium and all colonialists. The British "Observer" commented on the Leopoldville incident with these words: "The poisonous snake of African nationalism has entered the garden, and it is clear that it is impossible to drive it away." There are indeed poisonous snakes in the rich and beautiful garden of the Congo, and this is Belgian colonialism supported by the United States. The Congolese people must become the masters of their own garden, and the colonialist poisonous snakes will not leave if they do not leave. (Attached pictures)
