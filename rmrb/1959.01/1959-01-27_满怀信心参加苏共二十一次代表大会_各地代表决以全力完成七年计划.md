Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 26th. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will open tomorrow at 10:00 AM Moscow time in the Kremlin. All representatives from various regions have arrived in Moscow.

The working people of the Soviet Union are currently summarizing the victorious achievements of the labor competition they launched to greet the 21st Congress of the Party.

The spring workshop of the famous Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow overproduced products worth approximately 5 million rubles. All work teams in this workshop are striving to obtain the title of "Communist Labor Team". The heat treatment section's work team completed 130% to 140% of its quota every day in the competition.

The pre-congress competition in the open-hearth workshop of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant was in full swing. The entire workshop overproduced 350 tons of steel for the country in 23 days in January. Gusarov, a hero of socialist labor, overproduced 96 tons of metal in January.

In order to welcome the 21st Congress of the Party, the Asna Metallurgical Plant in Chelyabinsk built a new rolling workshop and put it into production on the 24th.

The rationalization proposals put forward by the workers of Riga's factories will save Latvia more than 100 million rubles in a year.

The representatives attending the 21st Congress expressed their confidence in completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan put forward by the Party with all their strength. Bogyeladze, an electric locomotive driver from Tbilisi and a representative of the Congress, said that every Soviet person in every position currently lives with the same belief, which is to contribute all their strength to the Seven-Year Plan. He said that the electric locomotive workers of Tbilisi must contribute all their strength to the task of converting 20,000 kilometers of railways to electric traction as stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan.

Kayela, a famous steelworker at the "Zaporozhstal" Steel Plant and a representative of the Congress, said, "I want to report to the Congress that in workshop No. 12 where I work, we produced 8,600 tons of steel more for the country last year." He said, "All the workers of the 'Zaporozhstal' Steel Plant have decided to produce tens of thousands of tons more steel for the country in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan."
