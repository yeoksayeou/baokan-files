    Fighting for Automobiles
    By Our Correspondent Kang Guozhi

    For more than two years, tens of thousands of "Liberation" brand automobiles have rolled off the production line at the First Automobile Works and headed to various parts of the country. This year, the production of "Liberation" brand automobiles will increase exponentially, and "Red Flag" and "East Wind" brand sedans will also be produced in batches. With a sense of pride, the automobile workers have taken on these arduous tasks.

    For the "Red Flag"
    Upon entering the factory area, one often sees the magnificent "Red Flag" sedans and the colorful "East Wind" sedans following each other closely, speeding back and forth. These are the workers conducting road tests. Mass production of these two types of sedans is no easy task. The extensive production preparation work usually takes more than a year to complete. However, the workers at the First Automobile Works are preparing to conquer this fortress in five months.

    Designing and manufacturing 1,900 sets of stamping dies is the first hurdle in the preparation work. In the past, it took several months to design and manufacture a large stamping die; now, it takes only a few days on average. The reason why hundreds of thousands of man-hours of tasks can be compressed into tens of thousands of man-hours is that people have liberated their minds and mustered courage and confidence.

    When the young workers in the chassis workshop first participated in the design with the technical staff, they did not dare to enter the design room, but walked in accompanied by the master craftsmen. Some old workers in the stamping die fixture workshop sat silently at the drawing board, years of experience churning in their minds, but not knowing how to express it. They sat for several hours, unable to draw a single line. However, when they left the desk and went to the workshop to see the sample cars, the situation was completely different. They saw what kind of parts the stamping dies they were designing were to produce and immediately shouted, "So that's what it is! I can make a stamping die to stamp it out without drawing a picture!" Some people also took the parts and asked the designers: Why does such a simple part require so many sets of stamping dies to produce? Can we reduce a few sets? The technical staff were surprised to hear their suggestions and said, "You are the best designers!" With the real objects in front of them, the workers thought and drew at the same time. If they couldn't draw a regular drawing for a while, they could draw a simpler one that could be understood. Some simply designed and manufactured it themselves, taking on the whole package, which was even more convenient. Now, through amateur cultural and technical studies, and through explanations from technical personnel, the workers are participating in design while learning drawing skills. Many people can now draw completely standard and formal drawings to express their design ideas. The stamping dies they design are also becoming larger and larger, from simple to complex, and they can design without real objects. They say:

    We fear neither heaven nor earth,
    We are the masters of the automobile factory,
    Workers become designers,
    We do whatever the Party tells us to do.

    This is no exaggeration. In the four days from January 12th to 16th, the stamping die fixture workshop completed sixty-three sets of stamping dies, which usually took dozens of days to design. Then, batches of fixtures designed by the workers in the chassis, engine, and other workshops were also manufactured.

    In the machine repair workshop, from autumn last year to now, it has been working day and night in three shifts. Hundreds of machine tools are spinning and roaring. The workers standing next to them are trying to increase production capacity tenfold in order to rush to manufacture hundreds of modern machine tools to achieve a production of 250 "Liberation" brand automobiles per shift and mass production of sedans. But they are still manufacturing indigenous machine tools, and they must use indigenous machine tools to build foreign machine tools to complete this task. Tonight, the young master craftsman Xiao Wenguang is on the night shift. A grinding machine he manufactured is about to be put into production. This machine tool is specially designed to process precision parts, worm screws. Without it, spline hobbing machines cannot be produced, and without spline hobbing machines, gears for sedans cannot be produced.

    A few days ago, the workshop raised the production of precision worm screws as a key issue, and Master Xiao expressed that he would make an indigenous grinding machine to solve it. At that time, someone took a similar part from an American machine tool and placed it in front of him, saying, "Look, how precise this is!" They believed that indigenous machine tools could not make such a thing and advocated ordering one from a machine tool factory in another place. But Xiao Wenguang firmly opposed it; he did not want a grinding machine with the "extend a hand" label. As a result, when those people ran around to other places and still couldn't find a manufacturer to undertake the task, Xiao Wenguang worked continuously for more than twenty days and made the grinding machine.

    When this grinding machine was test-run and processed a part, it achieved zero-level precision, one level higher than the part precision of that American machine tool. Some people said that this might be "lucky." He processed another one, and it was still zero-level, not a bit off. Who can say it was "lucky" again!

    Hard Work Plus Ingenuity
    On this day, it was snowing heavily, and the workers of the Second Foundry Workshop welcomed the Red Flag Team in the snow. This team, led by Factory Director Rao Bin, was placing a red flag in this workshop.

    "Foundry comrades, congratulations on smashing the 'bottleneck' of the entire factory. The production of the entire factory is no longer seriously affected because your workshop is a 'narrow area'," the factory director said excitedly.

    Up to the day of the speech, the monthly output of castings in the entire workshop had reached 1,000 tons, breaking the design capacity by five times. With castings, various parts and machines on automobiles can be manufactured.

    Communist Party member Zhang Qiwen accepted a red flag from the factory director in the applause. He is the central figure in breaking through the 1,000-ton mark.

    Last year, Zhang Qiwen led the workers of the entire group to work hard for half a year, and finally simply moved the bedding into the workshop. The monthly output increased from the design level of more than 200 tons to more than 500 tons, but it still could not meet the requirements of brother workshops. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the heavy burden of several thousand tons of casting tasks weighed on them, making it difficult to complete. They watched brother workshops send batches of casting tasks to outside factories for assistance; enduring the title of "bottleneck" of the entire factory, the mood of the foundry workers can be imagined. At this time, Zhang Qiwen and others were sent to other places to study. After carefully studying the advanced experience of the National Foundry Red Flag—Zhongzhu Factory in Shanghai, they proposed a "two-shift continuous production operation method" design plan based on the situation in their own workshop to reform the labor organization. As a result, without spending a penny and without adding a single piece of equipment, the monthly output broke through 1,000 tons.

    Wave After Wave Higher
    With the breakthrough of 1,000 tons, the workshops again requested that they produce 1,500 tons per month in February and March. As a result, the second and third "Zhang Qiwen" appeared, and the workers successively proposed several production increase plans. After the workshop integrated the advantages of these plans, it is organizing "three-shift collaborative continuous operation," moving towards producing 3,000 tons in February and March.

    Now, a huge banner hangs on the overhead crane in the foundry workshop: "Strive for the first place in the country in terms of casting unit area output!" This is their new determination.

    Leap Forward Again
    Each work section and team in the heat treatment workshop has hung up the red flag that has reached the "production capacity of 250 vehicles per shift," achieving "full house red." But the employees did not relax. They chose cutting-edge technology... gas cyanidation as the goal of continuing to leap forward. This is a major key to increasing the toughness and wear resistance of automobile parts and reducing production costs.

    In a small corner of the Second Work Section, several people cut open a discarded furnace as an experimental furnace body. They designed a furnace door themselves and smeared it with mud. The furnace is filled with combustible gas. On the surface, the furnace door is tightly sealed, but as long as you strike a match on the furnace door, the gas that emerges from the mud cracks will ignite a blue flame. Once, because a thin steel pipe on the furnace was not tightly connected, air leaked in, and the gas composition in the furnace changed, so the parts did not harden, but became as soft as noodles. The simplicity of the equipment declared the failure of this experiment.

    "Is there still hope?" someone asked.

    "It will definitely succeed, as long as our work is done properly," technician Tang Xibin replied firmly.

    New experiments began again! The new parts can only be sent into the furnace cavity through a steel pipe. But after this steel pipe is opened, the gas in the furnace rushes out and mixes with the air, which is likely to spontaneously ignite and explode. This is a tense moment.

    Young worker Cui Fengze said: "Be brave, we must learn from Qiu Caikang, the steelworker in Shanghai."

    "I'm only afraid that our contribution to the country will be small and the losses will be large. Let me think of a way," Tang Xibin continued.

    Tang Xibin raised the torch, and at the moment when the gas in the furnace and the air had not yet mixed after that steel pipe was opened, he artificially ignited the gas, and a tongue of flame immediately spewed out from the pipe mouth. Cui Fengze quickly pushed the part from the pipe mouth into the furnace cavity, and another worker braved the flames and quickly tightened the pipe mouth screw. The flame stubbornly rotated under his hands. The part was sealed in the furnace cavity and cyanided very ideally. Since then, the cutting-edge experiment conducted with simple equipment has been declared a success.

    At night, when the reporter left the First Automobile Works on the late-night trolley, the long whistle of the train came from the factory building. This may be a train transporting automobiles to other places, or it may be transporting steel from other places. The country needs the automobile factory to supply more automobiles, and the automobile factory also hopes that various places will transport more raw materials. (Attached picture)

    为汽车而战
    本报记者　康国志
    两年多来，上万辆“解放”牌汽车从第一汽车制造厂开出来奔向各地。今年，“解放”牌汽车将要成倍地增加，同时还要成批地生产“红旗”牌和“东风”牌小轿车。汽车工人们怀着自豪感，把这些繁重的任务担了起来。
    为了“红旗”
    一进厂区，常常会看到华贵的“红旗”牌轿车和五颜六色的“东风”牌轿车首尾相随，往来奔驰。这是工人们正在进行行车试验。成批生产这两种小轿车，可不是容易的事。那些浩繁的生产准备工作，一般的需要一年多才能完成。但是第一汽车厂的工人们却准备五个月内攻破这座堡垒。
    设计和制造一千九百套冲压模具，是准备工作的第一关。过去几个月才能设计和制造一套大型冲模，现在平均只要几天。几十万工时的任务，能够压缩在几万工时之内完成，一个重要的原因是人们解放了思想，鼓起了勇气和信心。
    当底盘车间的青年工人初次和技术人员一起参加设计时，他们没有胆量走进设计室，而是在老师傅的陪伴下走进去的。冲模夹具车间的一些老工人在画图板前，多年的经验在脑中翻腾，但不知怎样表达，他们默默地坐了几个小时，一条线也画不出来。可是，当他们离开桌案，到车间去看到样品汽车以后，情况就完全不同了。他们看见自己所要设计的冲模是要生产什么样的零件，马上喊起来：“原来就是它呀，不用画图我也能做个冲模把它冲出来。”也有的人拿着零件去问设计师：为什么一个简单的零件需要这么多套冲模生产，能不能减少几套？技术人员听了他们的修改意见，惊奇地说：“你们才是最好的设计师！”工人们面前摆上实物，边想边画，一时画不出正规图纸，就画个比较简略的也能看懂。有些干脆自己设计，自己制造，全包下来，更是方便。现在工人们通过业余文化技术学习，通过技术人员讲解，一边参加设计，一边学习绘画知识，已经有不少人能画出完全合乎标准的正规图纸来表达自己的设计思想了。他们设计的冲模，也由小到大，由简单到复杂，并且没有实物也能进行设计了，他们说：
    天不怕地不怕，
    汽车厂我当家，
    工人当了设计师，
    党叫干啥就干啥。
    这话一点不假，1月12日到16日的四天之内，冲模夹具车间就完成了平时需要几十天才能设计成功的六十三套冲模。接着底盘、发动机等车间工人们自己设计的夹具，也一批批地制造出来了。
    在机修车间，从去年秋季到现在，都是日夜三班。几百台机床飞旋轰响。站在旁边的工人们正在想办法要把生产能力提高十倍，以便为实现班产二百五十辆解放牌汽车和成批生产小轿车赶制几百台现代机床。但是他们现在制造的还是土机床，要用土机床造出洋机床来完成这个任务。今晚，年轻的师傅萧文光正在值夜班，他制造的一台磨床，就要投入生产了。这台机床专门加工精密的零件窝杆，没有它就不能生产插齿机，没有插齿机就不能生产轿车上的齿轮。
    前些天，车间把生产精密窝杆当作一个关键问题提出来，萧师傅表示要自制一台土磨床攻破它。当时有人拿出一个美国机床上的同样零件摆在跟前，对他说：“看看吧，这是多么精密呀！”他们认为土机床做不了这种东西，主张到外地的机床厂专门订制一台。但萧文光坚决反对，他不要“伸手牌”的磨床。结果，当那些人到外地跑了一大圈连个承制厂还没找到时，萧文光连续干了二十多天，把磨床制成了。
    这台磨床在试车时加工了一个零件，达到零级精度，比那台美国机床的零件精度高了一级。有人说这可能是“碰运气”。他又加工了一个，还是零级，一点不差，谁能再说是“碰”上的呢！
    苦干加巧干
    这天飞着大雪，第二铸工车间职工们冒雪迎接着红旗队。这个队由厂长饶斌率领，正在给这个车间插红旗。
      “铸工同志们，祝贺你们砸碎了全厂的‘瓶子口’，全厂的生产不再因为你们车间是一个‘狭窄地带’而严重受到影响。”厂长兴奋地讲着。
    到讲话这天为止，全车间月产铸件已达到一千吨，突破设计能力五倍。有了铸件，才能制造汽车上的各种部件和机器。
    共产党员张启文在掌声中从厂长手里接受了一面红旗，他就是突破千吨大关的中心人物。
    去年张启文率领全组工人苦战了半年，最后干脆把铺盖也搬进车间。月产量由设计水平二百多吨上升到五百多吨，但是还不能满足兄弟车间的要求。从去年年底到今年年初，几千吨铸造任务的重担压在他们身上，很难完成。他们眼看着兄弟车间把一批批的铸件任务送给外厂，向外求援；忍受着本车间被人叫做全厂的“瓶子口”的称号，铸工们的心情是可想而知的。就在这时，张启文等被派到外地学习。他们到上海的全国铸工红旗——中铸厂仔细地学习了人家的先进经验以后，就根据自己车间的情况，提出了“两班流水生产作业法”设计方案，改革劳动组织。结果不花一文钱，不增一台设备，月产量突破了千吨。
    一浪高过一浪
    千吨突破了，各车间又要求他们在2、3月份月产一千五百吨。于是，第二个，第三个“张启文”出现了，工人们接连提出好几个增产方案。车间里综合了这些方案的优点以后，正在组织“三班协作流水作业”，向2、3月生产三千吨迈进。
    现在，铸工车间的天车上悬着一条巨幅标语：“争取铸工单位面积产量全国第一！”这是他们的新的决心。
    跃进再跃进
    热处理车间的各工部，各小组都高高挂起已达到“班产二百五十辆生产能力”的红旗，实现了“满堂红”。但职工们并没有松一口气，他们选择了尖端技术……气体氰化作为继续跃进的目标。这是增加汽车零件的坚韧，耐磨性和降低生产成本的重大关键。
    在二工部一个不大的角落里，几个人把一个废弃的炉子切开，作为试验炉体。他们自己设计了一个炉门，用泥土糊起来。炉内充满可燃气体，表面看来炉门严密，可是只要是在炉门上擦一根火柴，从泥土缝隙中冒出的气体就会燃起蓝色火苗。有一次，由于炉上的一根细钢管没有接牢，透进了空气，炉内的气体成分因而发生变化，零件没有变硬，反而软得像面条一样。设备的简陋使这项试验宣告失败。
    “还有希望吗？”有人问。
    “肯定会成功，只要我们的工作做到家。”技术员唐锡斌坚定地回答。
    新的试验又开始了！新零件只能从钢管中送进炉膛。但是这支钢管打开后，炉内气体冲出和空气混合很可能自然发火爆炸。这是紧张的一刻。
    青年工人崔风泽说：“勇敢些，我们要学习上海炼钢工人丘财康。”
    “只怕我们给国家的贡献少，损失大，让我来想个办法，”唐锡斌接着说。
    唐锡斌高挑火把，就在那钢管打开后炉内气体和空气还没有混合的那一忽儿，人工地燃着气体，一条火舌立刻从管口喷吐出来。崔风泽赶快把零件从管口推进炉膛，另一个工人冒着火焰飞快地拧紧管口螺丝，那火焰就在他的手下顽强地旋转。零件被封在炉膛，氰化得十分合乎理想。从此用简陋设备进行的尖端试验宣告成功。
    夜晚，当记者乘晚班电车离开第一汽车厂时，从厂房那边传来了火车的长鸣，这许是火车向外地输送汽车，也许是从外地运来了钢材。全国需要汽车厂供应更多的汽车，汽车厂也盼望着各地给运来更多的原材料。（附图片）
