This newspaper reports that in 1958, the animal husbandry areas of Inner Mongolia underwent tremendous changes: after realizing the cooperativization of animal husbandry, they immediately basically realized the people's communes. Livestock greatly increased, settlement construction greatly accelerated, and industry and agriculture also greatly developed, presenting a scene of prosperity everywhere.

This year, under the leadership of the Party, more than 300,000 herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region completed the cooperativization of animal husbandry and realized the people's communes. Production and construction on the grasslands were greatly accelerated as a result. Last year, the herdsmen of the autonomous region supported the state with 1.2 million head of livestock and also increased the region's net livestock by more than 2 million head, an increase of about 10% compared to 1957. Currently, the total number of pregnant and suitable-aged female livestock in the region has reached more than 10.14 million head, which is unprecedented in the past.

More than 269,000 new livestock sheds were built on the winter and spring pastures, which, together with the existing 780,000 sheds, means that about 80% of the region's livestock now have warm sheds and enclosures. As a result of vigorously preventing and controlling various livestock diseases, the number of livestock that died of disease last year decreased from 2.4% in 1957 to about 1%.

The appearance of arid areas in pastoral regions has also greatly changed. Herdsmen have dug more than 10,000 water wells in approximately 9,000 square kilometers of water-deficient pastures, which can meet the drinking water needs of 2.51 million head of livestock. At the same time, the state has also helped herdsmen build four mechanical water supply stations and a number of machine wells and deep-water tube wells. The construction of grassland irrigation and reservoirs has also greatly developed.

Some new production technologies that meet the needs of faster development of animal husbandry have been further adopted. Last year, more than 90 tractors were transported to pastoral areas to directly serve animal husbandry production. Especially after communization, some communes even bought their own tractors and cars. New-style production tools such as grassland rakes, feed crushers, waterwheels, locomobiles, shearing machines, and milk separators have also increased compared to 1957. At the same time, the state has also helped herdsmen build 30 new mechanical grass-growing stations and improved 300,000 hectares of degraded pastures in poor grassland areas. In the rich Ujimqin grassland, a new mechanical fire prevention station equipped with cars, tractors, and telecommunications equipment has been built to protect the safety of grasslands and livestock.

This year, pastoral industry has also greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, more than 150 small and medium-sized factories and mines, including iron smelting, machinery, power generation, coal mining, brick and tile, dairy powder, wool weaving, and printing, were newly built and expanded last year in the vast grasslands of Xilin Gol, Hulunbuir, and Ordos. All banners (counties) and some sumu (townships) in pastoral areas have also opened roads for automobiles and are equipped with wired or wireless communication equipment. In particular, the opening of civil aviation routes in the grassland last year has brought greater convenience to the people in pastoral areas. This is a grassland route that takes off from Hohhot, the capital of the autonomous region, passes through the famous Xilin Gol grassland, passes through the grassland city of Xilinhot, and arrives at Hailar City in the Hulunbuir grassland, another large natural pasture in China. Now, urgently needed goods and letters and newspapers can be transported by air to the hinterland of the grassland in a timely manner. Many pastoral economic centers have also newly established factories last year, and some points have added schools, hospitals, cinemas, clubs and bathhouses.

In the process of cooperativization and people's communeization, the construction of settlements has greatly developed. Now, most of the commune's settlements have small processing plants for iron and wood, bricks and tiles, leather, wool, sewing, and food. According to incomplete statistics, herdsmen have established 219 new dairy powder factories on the grasslands alone, and these factories have produced more than 1.4 million catties of whole milk powder to support the people in the cities. At the same time, the state has also helped herdsmen build a mechanized forage farm and two mechanized forage seed breeding farms on the grassland.

Cultural undertakings and collective welfare undertakings in settlements are developing rapidly. Last year, six-year primary school education has been popularized in pastoral areas. While eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, amateur higher primary schools, amateur middle schools, half-farming and half-study middle schools, and spare-time schools combining politics, culture, and technology have also been newly established in settlements. Libraries, bookstores, clubs, hospitals, shops, nurseries, canteens, etc. have appeared in settlements, and some settlements have also installed electric lights, telephones, and wired broadcasting.

### 畜牧业高速发展　工厂大量兴办　定居地加快建设  牧区公社化　草原放光芒

    畜牧业高速发展　工厂大量兴办　定居地加快建设
    牧区公社化　草原放光芒
    本报讯　1958年，内蒙古畜牧业区变化万千：在实现了牧业合作化以后又紧接着基本上实现了人民公社化，牲畜大大增加，定居地建设大大加快，工农业也有很大发展，到处是一片繁荣景象。
    这一年，内蒙古自治区草原上的三十多万各民族牧民，在党的领导下，完成了畜牧业的合作化和实现了人民公社化。草原上的生产建设也因而大大加快。去年，自治区牧民支援了国家一百二十万头牲畜，还使全区纯增牲畜达到二百万头以上，比1957年增长10％左右。现在，全区受胎的大小适龄母畜已达一千零十四万多头，这是过去历史上没有的。
    在冬春季牧场上，新建了二十六万九千多座牲畜棚圈，连同原有的七十八万多座，全区80％左右的牲畜，现在都有了暖棚暖圈。由于大力防治各种牲畜疾病的结果，去年因病死亡的牲畜，由1957年的2.4％下降到1％左右。
    牧区干旱地带的面貌，也有很大改观。牧民们大约在九千平方公里的缺水牧场上，打了一万多眼水井，可以满足二百五十一万头牲畜饮水的需要。同时，国家还帮助牧民增建了四个机械供水站和一批机井及深水筒井。草原灌溉和水库的建设，也有很大发展。
    一些适应畜牧业更快发展需要的新的生产技术，已进一步被采用。去年运到牧区直接为牧业生产服务的有九十多台拖拉机，特别是公社化后，有的公社还自己买了拖拉机和汽车。草原上的打搂草机、饲料粉碎机、水车、锅驼机、剪毛机、牛奶分离器等新式生产工具，也都比1957年有了增加。同时国家还帮助牧民新建三十个机械育草站，在贫瘠草原区改良了三十万公顷退化了的牧场。在丰美的乌珠穆沁草原，新建了一个拥有汽车、拖拉机和电讯设备的机械防火站，以保护草原和牲畜的安全。
    这一年，牧区工业也有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，去年在锡林郭勒、呼伦贝尔和鄂尔多斯等大草原上，新建和扩建了炼铁、机械、发电、煤矿、砖瓦、乳粉、毛织、印刷等一百五十多个中小型厂矿。牧区各旗（县）和部分苏木（乡），也已通行汽车和设有有线或无线电通讯设备。特别是去年草原民用航线的开辟，给牧区人民带来了更大的方便。这是条从自治区首府呼和浩特起飞，穿过我国著名的锡林郭勒大草原，途经草原城市锡林浩特，到我国另一个天然大牧场呼伦贝尔草原的海拉尔市的草原航线。现在，牧民们急需用的物品和书信报刊，都能及时空运到草原腹地。许多牧区经济中心在去年还新建立了工厂，有的点上增建了学校、医院、影剧院、俱乐部和浴池。
    在合作化和人民公社化过程中，定居地建设有了很大发展。现在绝大部分公社的定居地上都有铁木、砖瓦、皮革、毛制、缝纫、食品等小型加工厂。据不完全统计，牧民们仅在草原上新办的乳粉厂就有二百十九个，这些工厂已经生产出一百四十多万斤全脂乳粉，支援了城市人民。同时，国家还帮助牧民在草原上新建了一个机耕饲料农场和两个机耕饲料种籽繁殖场。
    定居地上的文化事业和集体福利事业正在迅速发展。去年，牧区已经普及了六年制小学教育，在扫除青壮年文盲的同时，还在定居地上新办了业余高小、业余中学、半牧半读中学和政治、文化、技术三结合的业余学校。图书馆、书店、俱乐部、医院、商店、托儿所、食堂等都在定居地上出现了，有的定居地上还安上了电灯、电话和有线广播。（附图片）
