The nationwide movement to convert automobiles into trains is developing rapidly. By the end of 1958, more than 30,000 trailers had been manufactured, playing an important role in alleviating the transportation strain. The trailers manufactured nationwide, averaging three tons in load capacity, are equivalent to more than 27,000解放 (Jiefang - Liberation) brand trucks with a four-ton capacity put into highway transportation, increasing the existing automobile freight transport capacity by more than half.

In the manufacturing of trailers, great support was received from party and government leaders at all levels. The Secretary of the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, the Deputy Commissioner of the Tangshan Special District, and some county magistrates personally took charge of this work. Therefore, the development of trailers in the province was relatively rapid. By mid-December of last year, more than 4,000 trailers had been manufactured. At the same time, the movement was carried out deeply and broadly. Now, the manufacturing of trailers is not only limited to the transportation sector, but has penetrated into factories, mines, government agencies, and townships.

Localities generally adopt the method of using local materials to manufacture trailers. If steel is insufficient, wood is used instead; if tools are insufficient, they are made and improved by hand; if there are technical difficulties, everyone comes up with ideas. Therefore, the trailers manufactured have various structures, such as iron-wood, bamboo-wood, and all-wood structures. The Zhangjiakou Transportation Bureau has also manufactured wooden-wheeled trailers, which, after testing and appraisal, can be used completely. Henan Province uses mulberry wood to make trailer springs. The Huaibei Automobile Team in Anhui found a lot of broken steel plates from waste materials, welded them section by section, and made bamboo-style steel tow bars.

Currently, trailers have been extended to passenger vehicles. Public buses in fourteen cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Shenyang, have implemented towing trailers on some routes. Long-distance buses in Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, and other places have also been equipped with trailers. The use of trailers in freight transport has also been further developed. Many places have manufactured various special trailers according to the needs of special cargo transportation. The 18-ton large trailers manufactured in Lishui, Zhejiang Province, can transport long logs and bamboos over 20 meters long, which are suitable for the export of local specialties.

Trailers have now become a popular mode of transportation in the national highway transportation system. Automobile workers praise the train-like transformation of automobiles, saying: "The train is like a dragon, it can drill through every road; large vehicles can tow, small vehicles do not relax; tow one or two sections, even high mountains can be conquered; automobiles are like trains, showing power in the plains; workers' minds are clever, creating miracles everywhere."

### 挂车三万辆　处处显威风  汽车拖挂运输运力增加半倍

    挂车三万辆　处处显威风
    汽车拖挂运输运力增加半倍
    本报讯　全国汽车列车化运动正在迅速发展，到1958年底已经制造挂车三万多辆，对缓和运输紧张状况起了重要作用。全国已经制成的挂车平均按载重三吨计算，相当于载重四吨的解放牌汽车二万七千多辆投入公路运输，增长现有汽车货物运输能力一半以上。
    在制造挂车当中，得到了各级党政领导的极大支持。中共河北省张家口地委书记、唐山专署副专员以及一些县长都亲自抓这一工作。因此该省挂车的发展较快，截至去年12月中旬，就已制成挂车四千多辆。同时运动开展得深，面也较广，现在制造挂车已不单是交通运输部门，已经深入到厂矿、机关和县乡。
    各地制造挂车，一般都采取就地取材的办法，钢材不足就用木材代替；工具不足就用手工制造和改进工具；技术上有困难就大家想办法。因此制成的挂车，有铁木结构、竹木结构和全木结构等多种。张家口交通运输局还制成了木轮挂车，经过试验鉴定，完全可以使用。河南省用桑木制成挂车弹簧。安徽淮北汽车队，从废料中找出了不少断钢板，把它一段一段焊起来，制成了竹节式钢板拖杆。
    目前挂车已推行到公路客运车辆上使用。如北京、上海、青岛、沈阳等十四个城市的公共汽车已在部分路线实行拖带挂车。广东、湖南、广西等地的长途客车也拖上了挂车。挂车在货运上的使用，也已有了进一步的发展。许多地方根据特种货物运输的需要，制造了各种专用挂车。浙江省丽水制造的十八吨大挂车，可运二十公尺以上的长梢木和毛竹，适合当地特产的输出。
    挂车现在已成为全国公路运输中风行的一种运输方式。汽车工人赞美汽车列车化，他们说：“列车像条龙，路路可钻通；大车能拖挂，小车不放松；拖它一两节，高山也可攻；汽车似火车，平原显威风；工人心思巧，处处奏奇功。”（附图片）
