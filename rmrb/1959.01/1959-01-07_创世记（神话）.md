Genesis (Myth)
    Ruoshui
    Prologue: The Creation of the World

    In the beginning, there was something. At that time, the world was still a chaos: heaven and earth were mixed together, light and darkness were mixed together, there were no directions, and there was no day or night. The universe was a mass of unformed matter, like a large egg.

    A life was conceived in the chaos. He slept in this egg like a baby sleeps in the womb, and the essence of the universe nourished his growth. This was Pangu.

    After who knows how long, he finally grew up, and at this time, he also woke up.

    He rubbed his eyes and looked around in confusion. There was no light, no color, no sound, only a dead, dark, unfathomable fog. He couldn't see anything, couldn't grasp anything; he couldn't even see his own body. Where was he? What was he like? In any case, this indescribable fog was not himself; it surrounded him, hindered him, teased him, and opposed him. He anxiously wanted to get out, but no matter which direction he went, he could not get out. He was locked in. "How stuffy!..." he thought.

    He put his hands on his hips, and unintentionally his hand touched a hard, cold object, which was a broad axe. He was overjoyed, raised his axe, and with all his strength, he smashed it fiercely at the fog in front of him—

    There was a loud noise like a mountain collapsing and the earth cracking, and the big egg broke. Countless particles of matter collided randomly under the vibration of this blow. The chaotic world, like a broken egg yolk, spread out in the void, rotating like a nebula. After a great chaos, order gradually emerged, and similar substances gathered together. Finally, the light and clear things rose up and became the sky, and the heavy and turbid things condensed down and became the earth.

    Chaos had just opened, and the beginning of the universe was separated. A new world appeared. Pangu stood towering in the middle of it. He stood with his head supporting the sky and his feet treading on the earth, changing along with heaven and earth. The sky rose one zhang every day, the earth thickened one zhang every day, and Pangu's body also grew one zhang every day.

    It is said that Pangu finally died after living for 18,000 years. When Pangu was dying, he transformed: his breath became wind and clouds, his sweat became rain and dew, his voice became thunder, his eyes became the sun and moon, his blood became rivers, his muscles became fields and soil, his hair became grass and trees, and finally, his bones became minerals.

    This is the birth of the world.

    Chapter 1: The Beginning of Man

    The descendants of Pangu were working on the earth.

    Since the beginning of the world, since there have been human beings, they have relied on labor to support themselves. They hunted and fished, raised livestock, and gathered fruits.

    They worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, living in a daze, in harmony with nature.

    Their lives were hard, but they were equal to each other. They didn't know what was "yours" or "mine."

    They were weak, they feared nature, but they believed that they were all descendants of gods, and that gods treated each of them equally.

    They were slaves to nature, but they were masters of themselves.

    They were free, although this freedom was also poor....

    Chapter 2: Sin and Punishment

    The sun and moon revolved like shooting stars, and thousands upon thousands of years passed like smoke. Mankind gradually became civilized, but at this time inequality also appeared. People were divided. A few people enslaved the majority, they did not work, but they plundered what the majority of workers produced.

    They possessed material wealth, and they also monopolized spiritual wealth. They proclaimed that only their specialized spiritual activities were noble, while physical labor was base. They said that only they were the true favorites of the gods, the representatives of the gods on earth.

    The workers felt that they had been abandoned by the gods, that they had become "outcasts of heaven." They called out to the gods. But where were the gods? The gods were not on earth. This world was corrupted, people were separated from each other, and gods were also separated from people.

    The working people missed their ancestors, their gods. But Pangu did not appear before them—he seemed to be dead forever, this great god who created the world.

    Another legend appeared. It is said that the world was not created by Pangu, but by another god. This god also did not create the world with labor, but with language, with commands. God said, let there be heaven and earth, let there be day and night; and there was heaven and earth, and there was day and night. That's how the world was made.

    God also made man out of clay in his own image. Man initially lived in heaven with God. But later, man violated God's prohibition and stole the fruit of knowledge, which was a sin. The enraged God banished man from the paradise in heaven and cursed man, saying:

    "You will toil all your life, sweating on your face, to make a living, until you return to the earth, because you came from the earth—you are dust, and you will return to dust."

    Thus, man lost paradise and fell from heaven to earth. Bearing God's curse, he toiled all his life, sweating on his face, "cultivating the soil from which he came."

    This legend also seems to be true, labor does not seem to be man's nature, but rather a punishment. Heavy, forced labor became hard labor, a torture for the workers, making the workers feel disgusted. In labor, the worker felt that he was not a person—he was living an inhuman life and receiving inhuman treatment. In labor, he sank to an inhuman status.

    The workers did not want to be slaves, they demanded human rights. Thus, resistance broke out and struggles were launched. However, they were suppressed again and again. Light retreated, and darkness shrouded the world. The earth was filled with the blood and tears of slaves....

    Chapter 3: The Rebellion of the Slaves

    Again, who knows how many ages have passed.

    The long night, so dark, so cold...

    A torch appeared in the darkness, a strange shadow wandered on the earth. A voice rang out in the silence, it was the voice of the prophet: "Blessed are the oppressed, for the world is yours. You have nothing, but you shall have everything." "Who is our savior?" the workers asked. "No one else can save you, only you can save yourselves. Slaves are the masters of history, now it is your turn to be your own masters. The plunderers will be plundered. As for you, all you lose are chains, and all you win is the world. Sinners of the world! Unite to fight!" The wind carried this loud call throughout the world. This wind blew the spark in the workers' hearts into a raging flame.

    Half the sky was red with fire: that was the East, where the struggle first broke out.

    Chapter 4: The Dawn of the East

    The fire spread in the East, and one tyrant after another fell. The victorious banner of the workers was planted on the vast land. The dawn rose in the East.

    This is a new world.

    The worker became his own master. He worked for himself, and at this time he felt the dignity and value of labor. He was no longer enslaved, and at this time he felt that he was a real person, a dignified person.

    "Man"—what a proud name!

    He began to build his own home and arrange his own life. He had longed for happiness for a long time, and now he was determined to realize his dream. This dream, the great prophet had long predicted its realization.

    But the worker also felt that he needed to enrich himself and make himself stronger. At this time, he remembered the ancient legend of the tree of knowledge.

    According to this legend, when man ate this fruit, his eyes would be opened, and he would have great wisdom, similar to God, and this would be envied by God.

    "Is there really such a tree?" the worker wondered.

    He was determined to find this tree.

    Chapter 5: The Tree of Knowledge

    The worker came to a majestic palace.

    This palace was forbidden to him during the reign of the tyrant. Now he had taken the key to the gate. He opened the gate of the palace and walked in.

    As soon as he stepped into the door, his eyes were almost blinded by the light. The palace was so magnificent and resplendent, countless things emitted dazzling light, making him dizzy and fascinated. After a while, he gradually saw clearly that it was not gold or silver treasures, but countless glass bottles of various shapes, glass tubes, balances, microscopes, specimens of various minerals, animals and plants, batteries, motors, globes, models of various machines and buildings, and many other unknown things. He was almost a little timid, but he soon got used to this place. He raised his head and walked straight in.

    Then, in the center of the last hall of the palace, he saw a tree.

    This was a strange evergreen tree: the tree was covered with thousands of flowers, each with its own shape, color and fragrance. Some of these flowers had already withered or were withering, they were not fruitful. As for the fruitful flowers, they never withered, and they were connected to the fruit, always so bright and beautiful. The tree was full of fruit, huge and unparalleled, pressing down the branches, they seemed to be anxiously waiting for people to pick them.

    The tree was at least several thousand years old, but it seemed to have just begun its youth, and it didn't seem to know how tall and big it would grow.

    The worker scrutinized the tree with unwavering eyes. Suddenly he discovered: this was the tree he had planted with his own hands, he had watered this tree with his own sweat. Although this tree had grown so tall, he still recognized its original appearance.

    He climbed the tree and began to pick the fruit.

    "Now I am really committing a crime," he said to himself with a smile, "the fruit borne by the tree I planted myself has become my forbidden fruit, the original owner steals his own lost property from the thief."

    He ate a fruit. Suddenly he felt a great change in himself, the endless energy hidden in his whole body began to be released, his eyes shot out two beams of electric light, making him see everything more clearly and more truly.

    He came down from the tree, took the useful things in the hall, armed himself from head to toe, and then walked out of the palace gate.

    Ahead was an endless road. He moved forward courageously, sweating and enjoying the joy of struggle. Along the way, he opened roads through mountains and built bridges over rivers, relying on his weapons to overcome many difficulties and advance victoriously.

    Then, he suddenly saw a vision: in the distant horizon, a huge figure was walking towards him.

    Chapter 6: Man and God

    As the giant shadow approached him, and he also approached the giant shadow, the worker saw that standing before him was a great god: a solid chest, strong arms, huge hands, and light radiating all over his body.

    "Who are you?" the worker asked.

    "I am you," the great god replied.

    "You are me?—But I don't know you."

    "That's precisely because you don't know yourself yet.

    I am the ancestor of mankind, I created man.

    I am the master of the world, I created the world.

    I am Pangu, I am the embodiment of labor."

    "Ah, God Pangu! How many ages have I been looking for you.

    Are you not dead? Or have you resurrected?"

    "I am not dead, I have been with you since ancient times.

    I am your phantom, you are my flesh.

    In the past, you have been suffering, your labor, the products of your labor, do not belong to you.

    So you don't know me: you give all the great powers to me, and attribute all the humbleness to yourself.

    But labor should not be cursed, labor is a blessing.

    The fruit you eat gives you blessings and elevates you.

    It gives you divine power, enabling you to turn myths into reality and reality into myths.

    Now my mission is over, and I am going back to you.

    Man no longer needs illusory gods, man himself is God—

    Man is growing into God, man is God in the making.

    In the past, man created God in his own image.

    Now, man recreates himself in the image of God.

    Man, believe in yourself, worship yourself!

    It is you who moves mountains and overturns seas, and tames rivers.

    It is you who rides the clouds and drives the fog, and calls the wind and summons the rain.

    You call the earth to offer all her secret treasures.

    You call grain to gush from the ground like a spring.

    You can shorten space, making ten thousand miles become a short distance.

    You can transcend time, making one day equal to twenty years.

    You have such eyes that can see the end of an autumn hair as a cartload of firewood.

    You have such ears that can hear the slightest sound from thousands of miles away.

    You have such hands, one hand repairs the earth, and the other hand throws stars into space.

    You change the color of the wind and clouds with one breath.

    You shake the heavens and the earth with one shout.

    You are omnipotent. You are magically powerful, and your power is boundless.

    Man! The earth is too small for you, it is your cradle, but not your destination.

    You no longer need to return to dust, you can build new residences on the moon and other more distant stars.

    You will continue to conquer the earth, but you must also begin the expedition of the universe.

    You are about to end your early history and leap to freedom.

    At that time, you will become the master of the universe step by step, heaven and earth, will be your paradise."

    After saying this, Pangu disappeared.

    The worker lowered his head to look at himself, and suddenly found that his body had become unusually tall. Half of his body stretched above the sea of clouds, and through the gaps in the clouds, he saw the surging waves hitting his feet. He looked at his hands, which were precisely Pangu's huge hands that created the world. He understood: the one who returned to his side was precisely the other self he had created, and now, Pangu had become one with him.

    A loud paean resounded in the sky, and the heavenly wind blew through his hair. Then he turned around, using the earth as a stepping stone, and strode towards the starry, magnificent and solemn universe....

    创世记（神话）
    若水
    序幕  开天辟地
    太初有物。那时世界还是一片混沌：天和地混在一起，光明和黑暗混在一起，没有上下四方，也没有白天黑夜。宇宙是一团没有成形的物质，有如一个大鸡蛋。
    混沌之中孕育着一个生命。他睡在这个鸡蛋中好像婴儿睡在母胎里，宇宙的精华作了他成长的养料。这是盘古。
    不知道经过多少时候，他终于长成了，而这时他也就醒过来。
    他揉揉自己的眼睛，迷惘地四顾。没有光，没有色彩，没有声音，只有一片死寂的、昏暗的、深不可测的云雾。什么也看不见，什么也捉摸不到；他甚至看不见自己的身体。他在哪里呢？他是什么样的呢？无论如何，这一片不可名状的雾不是他自己，它包围他，阻碍他，捉弄他，和他对立。他焦躁地想走出去，然而无论他往那个方向走，总是走不出去。他是被锁闭住了。“好气闷！……”他想。
    他把手叉在腰间，无意之中他的手触到了一个坚硬冰冷的东西，这是一把板斧。他欣喜了，抡起他的板斧，朝着面前这一片迷雾，用尽全身的力，猛地一劈——
    只听得山崩地裂似的一声巨响，大鸡蛋破裂了。无数物质的微粒在这一击的震动之下乱碰乱撞。混沌一团的世界像打碎的蛋黄一样在虚空中扩散开来，星云似地旋转。一阵大混乱之后，渐渐产生了秩序，同类的物质聚集在一起。最后，轻清的东西上腾，变成天，重浊的东西下凝，变成地。
    混沌初开，鸿蒙始分，一个新天地出现了。这当中巍然屹立着盘古。他头顶天，脚踏地，随着天地一同变化。天每天升高一丈，地每天加厚一丈，盘古的身子也每天增长一丈。
    据说，盘古活到一万八千岁以后终于死了。盘古垂死时化身：气息变成风云，汗滴变成雨露，声音变成雷霆，两眼变成日月，血液变成江河，肌肉变成田土，毛发变成草木，最后，他的骨胳变成了矿石。
    这就是世界的诞生。
    第一章　人之初
    盘古的子孙在大地上劳动着。
    从洪荒之世起，从有人类以来，他们就都是依靠劳动来养活自己。他们打猎捕鱼，饲养牲畜，采集果实。
    他们日出而作，日入而息，浑浑噩噩，与自然一体。
    他们的生活是艰辛的，可是他们彼此间是平等的。他们也不知道什么是“你的”“我的”。
    他们是软弱的，他们畏惧自然，可是他们相信，他们都是神的后裔，而神对他们每一个人也是一视同仁的。
    他们是自然的奴隶，可是他们是自己的主人。
    他们是自由的，虽则这自由同时又是贫乏的。……
    第二章　罪与罚
    日月如流星一样旋转，几千几万年烟云一样过去了。人类逐渐走向开化，可是这时也出现了不平等。人和人分裂了。少数人奴役了大多数人，他们不劳动，却剥夺大多数劳动者生产出来的东西。
    他们占有了物质的财富，他们也垄断了精神的财富。他们宣称：只有他们专门从事的精神的活动才是高贵的，而肉体的劳动是下贱的。他们说只有他们才是真正的神明的宠儿，是神在人间的代表。
    劳动者感到他们被神遗弃了，他们成了“天之僇民”。他们呼唤神。可是神在哪里呢？神不在人间。这世界败坏了，人和人分离了，神和人也分离了。
    劳动人民思念他们的始祖，他们的神祗。然而盘古不在他们面前显现——他好像永远死了，这伟大的创造天地的神。
    出现了另外一种传说。据说：这世界并不是盘古创造的，创造世界的是另一个神。这个神创造世界也不是用劳动，而是用语言，用命令。神说，要有天有地，有日有夜；于是就有天有地，有日有夜。世界就这样造成了。
    神也按照自己的形象，用泥土造成了人。人最初和神一同住在天上。可是后来人违背神的禁令，偷吃了知识之果，这就犯了罪。震怒的神，把人从天上的乐园放逐出来，并且诅咒人说：
    “你必终身劳苦，汗流满面，才得糊口，直到你归了土，因为你是从土而出的——你本是尘土，仍要归于尘土。”
  这样，人就失去了乐园，从天上堕落到地上。他背负着神的诅咒，终身劳苦，汗流满面，“耕种他所自出之土”。
    这传说也好像是真的，劳动不像是人的本性，而像是惩罚。沉重的、强制的劳动对劳动者成了苦役，成了折磨，使劳动者感到厌弃。劳动者在劳动中感到他不是一个人——他过的是非人的生活，受的是非人的待遇。他在劳动中沉沦到非人的地位。
    劳动者不愿做奴隶，他们要求人的权利。于是爆发了反抗，掀起了斗争。然而一次又一次被镇压下去了。光明退隐，黑暗笼罩着人间。大地上流满了奴隶的血和泪。……
    第三章　奴隶的反叛
    又不知过了几世几劫。
    漫长的夜，又黑，又冷……
    黑暗中出现了一个火炬，一个怪影在大地上游荡。一个声音在寂静中响亮，这是先知的声音：“被压迫者有福了，因为世界是你们的。你们一无所有，但你们要有一切。”“谁是我们的救主？”劳动者问。“没有别人能拯救你们，只有你们自己救自己。奴隶本是历史的主人，现在该你们作自己的主人。剥夺者将被剥夺。至于你们，失去的只是锁链，赢得的却是全世界。全世界的罪人啊！联合起来去斗争！”风把这个宏亮的号召传遍了世界。这阵风把劳动者心中的火种吹成了烈焰。
    半边天空被大火映得通红：那是东方，斗争首先在那里爆发了。
    第四章　东方的曙光
    大火在东方蔓延，一个暴君接着又一个暴君倒下去了。劳动者的胜利的旗帜插在广大的土地上。东方升起了曙光。
    这是一个新世界。
    劳动者作了自己的主人。他为自己劳动，这时他才感到劳动的尊严和价值。他不受奴役，这时他才感到自己是真正的人，堂堂的人。
  “人”——这是一个多么值得自豪的名字啊！
    他开始建设自己的家园，安排自己的生活。他曾经长久向往过幸福，现在他决心实现自己的梦想。这梦想，伟大的先知早就预言了它的实现。
    但是，劳动者也感到还需要充实自己，使他自己更有力量。这时他想起了那个古老的传说中的知识之树。
    根据这个传说，人吃了这果实，眼睛就亮了，人就有大智慧，和神相似，而这就遭到了神的忌妒。
    “真有这样的树么？”劳动者思索着。
    他决意要寻找这棵树。
    第五章　知识之树
    劳动者来到了一座巍峨的宫殿前面。
    这宫殿，在暴君统治的时代，是禁止他进去的。现在他已经把大门的钥匙取到了。他打开了宫殿的大门，走了进去。
    他刚一跨进门，眼睛就被刺得几乎张不开了。宫殿里面是这样堂皇富丽，数不清的东西发出夺目的光彩，使他目眩神迷。过了一会，他才逐渐看清，那也并不是什么金银财宝，而是数不清的各种形状的玻璃瓶子，玻璃管子，天秤，显微镜，各种矿石和动植物的标本，电池，马达，地球仪，各种机器和建设物的模型，还有许多其他不知名的东西。他几乎有点畏怯了，但他很快就习惯了这个地方。他昂起头，一直走进去。
    于是，在宫殿的最后一个殿堂的中央，他看到了一棵树。
    这是一棵奇异的常青树：树上开着千万朵花，各有各的形状，色彩和香味。其中也有一些花已经或正在雕谢，它们是不结实的。至于那结实的花，却永不雕谢，和果实连在一起，永是那样鲜艳美丽。那树上结着累累的果实，硕大无比，压得枝条都弯了，它们好像正在焦急地等候人去采撷。
    这棵树的年龄至少也有几千年了，可是它好像还刚刚开始它的青春时代，看样子它还不知道要长得多高多大。
    劳动者目不转睛的审视这棵树。忽然他发现了：这正是他亲手种植的树，他用自己的汗滴灌溉过这棵树。虽然这棵树长得这样高大了，但他还认得出它原来的样子。
    他攀登上这棵树，开始采撷果实。
    “我现在是真的犯罪了。”他微笑地对自己说，“我自己种植的树所结的果实成了我的禁果，原主从偷盗者那里偷盗他自己的失物。”
    他吃下了一个果子。突然他觉得自己起了极大的变化，他全身蕴藏着的无穷无尽的精力都开始解放出来，他的两眼射出了两道电光，使他看一切事物都格外分明，格外真实。
    他从树上下来，把殿里的有用的东西拿来，从头到脚武装了自己，然后走出了宫门。
    前面是一条无尽的路。他奋然前行，流着汗，同时享受斗争的喜悦。一路上他逢山开路，遇水搭桥，靠他的武器战胜了重重困难，胜利地前进。
    于是，他突然看到了异象：在遥远的天边，一个巨大的身影迎着他走来。
    第六章　人与神
    当巨影走近他，他也走近巨影时，劳动者看到，站在他面前的是一个大神：结实的胸膛，粗壮的胳臂，巨大的双手，遍身发出光辉。
    “你是谁？”劳动者问。
    “我是你。”大神回答。
    “你是我？——可是我不认识你。”
    “那正因为你还不认识你自己。
    我是人类的始祖，我创造了人。
    我是世界的主人，我创造了世界。
    我是盘古，我是劳动的化身。”
    “啊，盘古神啊！我寻找你多少年代了。
    你没有死么？还是你复活了呢？”
    “我没有死，亘古以来，我就和你同在。
    我是你的幻影，你是我的肉身。
    从前，你一直受苦，你的劳动，你的劳动的产品，都不属于你。
    所以你不认识我：你把一切伟大的能力都赋予我，而把一切卑微归于自己。
    但是劳动不当受到诅咒，劳动是祝福。
    你所吃的果子赐予你福祉，把你提升。
    它赋予你神力，使你把神话变成现实，把现实变成神话。
    现在我的使命结束了，我要回到你身上了。
    人不再需要虚幻的神，人自己就是神——
    人正在成长为神，人是正在成长中的神。
    从前，人按照自己的形象创造了神。
    现在，人按照神的形象再创造他自己。
    人啊，信仰你自己，崇拜你自己吧！
    移山倒海，驯服江河的是你。
    腾云驾雾，呼风唤雨的是你。
    你叫大地献出她的一切秘密的宝藏。
    你叫粮食像泉水一样从地里涌出。
    你能缩短空间，使万里变为咫尺。
    你能超越时间，使一天等于二十年。
    你有这样的眼，能把秋毫之末看成舆薪。
    你有这样的耳，能听见千里外的微声。
    你有这样的双手，一只手修理地球，一只手把星星抛掷在太空。
    你吹一口气风云变色。
    你发一声喊天地震动。
    你是全能的。你神通广大，法力无边。
    人啊！地球对于你是太小了，它是你的摇篮，但不是你的归宿。
    你不必再归于尘土，你可以到月亮上和其他更远的星星上建立新的住所。
    你还要继续征服地球，但你也要开始宇宙的远征。
    你就要结束你的前期史，向自由飞跃。
    那时你将一步步成为宇宙的主宰，天上地下，都是你的乐园。”
    说完这话，盘古就不见了。
    劳动者低下头来看自己，忽然发现他的身躯变得异常高大了。他的半截身子伸在云海之上，透过云的间隙，他看见汹涌的海涛冲激他的脚。他看看自己的手，这正是盘古的那双开天辟地的巨大的手。他明白了：回到他身旁的，正是他所创造的另一个自己，而现在，盘古已经和他合为一体。
    天空响起了一片宏亮的凯歌，天风吹拂着他的头发，于是他转过身来，以地球为垫脚石，跨向那星光灿烂，伟大庄严的宇宙。……
