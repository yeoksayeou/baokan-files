Xinhua News Agency, 26th: New York News: The American "Worker's Weekly" recently published a telegram from the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party to the Communist Party USA. The telegram sternly condemned the shameless clamor of American reactionary groups regarding Cuba's execution of criminals and called on the American working class to support the just struggle of the Cuban people.

The telegram stated: "The enemies of the Cuban people, primarily the American imperialists, are attempting to carry out hysterical propaganda about the punishment of executioners and murderers who served the tyrannical regime, in order to slander our revolution."

The telegram continued, the Cuban government's punishment of Batista's murderous criminals was not for revenge, "but to prevent the recurrence of the Nazi atrocities of the Batista bandits who served American imperialism. This punishment is being carried out in strict accordance with the revolutionary criminal code, which provides the accused with necessary guarantees. The revolutionary tribunal has received the full support of all the people."

The telegram concluded: "Imperialism and reactionaries are creating conditions for counter-revolution. We ask you and, through you, the working class and people of your country, to widely disseminate the true situation and expose the false propaganda being carried out by American imperialism under the guise of humanitarianism."

    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”最近刊登了古巴人民社会党全国委员会给美国共产党的一份电报。这份电报严厉谴责美国反动集团对古巴处决罪犯的无耻叫嚣，并要求美国工人阶级支援古巴人民的正义斗争。
    电报说：“古巴人民的敌人，首先是美帝国主义者，企图就惩罚为暴虐政权服务的刽子手和杀人犯问题进行歇斯底里的宣传，以诽谤我们的革命。”
    电报接着说，古巴政府对巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的惩罚不是为了报复，“而是为了防止为美帝国主义服务的巴蒂斯塔匪帮的纳粹暴行重演，这种惩罚是在严格按照给被告以必要保证的革命刑法法典下进行的。革命的裁判受到了全体人民的全力支持。”
    电报最后说：“帝国主义和反动派正在为反革命创造条件。我们要求你们和通过你们，要求你们国家的工人阶级和人民，广泛介绍真实情况和揭穿美帝国主义在人道主义的掩饰下，所进行的虚伪宣传”。
