Thoroughly Smash the Transportation Barrier
Gao Hongji, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Houma Municipal Committee

    Since the mass campaign for steel production began, transportation in the Xinjiang area of Shanxi has been universally strained. According to the transportation tasks at the time, more than 90,000 truck trips with a load capacity of three tons were needed. However, the entire county only had nineteen freight trucks from government agencies, factories, and mines, of which only nine were usable, plus more than 3,200 horse-drawn carts, iron-wheeled carts, and flatbed carts scattered among various townships and communes. Obviously, the transportation capacity was far from meeting the needs of the transportation volume. How to solve this contradiction? After studying the matter, the county party committee believed that it was necessary to mobilize the masses and implement the "small-scale, local mass movement" approach.

    However, when the party committee issued the call, it found that a few people were resistant. Some people looked down on the small-scale, local mass movement, sitting in their offices and calculating with their abacuses, becoming more and more pessimistic. In their view, transportation tensions could not be changed, and it was inevitable that iron and grain could not both leap forward simultaneously, that grasping one would mean losing the other. Still others were short-sighted and lacked an overall perspective, unable to mobilize vehicles, and unwilling to repair them when they broke down, preferring not to use them themselves rather than supporting steel production. Therefore, without strengthening political and ideological education and establishing a communist ideology, the transportation barrier could not be overcome. Thus, the county party committee organized all cadres and masses in the county to conduct a large-scale debate. As a result of the debate, ideas were unified, the county party secretary took command and established a headquarters, and all transportation tools in the county were under unified command and allocation. The first secretaries of the party committees of various townships also personally took charge of transportation work.

    However, due to incomplete organization and lax management systems, new problems arose, namely, extremely serious chaotic phenomena. Some large carts would go out for nine days without returning; some large carts were originally assigned the task of delivering grain uphill and transporting iron downhill, but ended up going and returning empty. Therefore, later we adopted organizational methods of fixed routes, fixed locations, fixed tasks, fixed organizations, and zonal transportation. We divided the teams into four, making unified arrangements. The first team was the vanguard transportation team, dedicated to transporting coal and ore for indigenous blast furnaces and earthen reverberatory furnaces for steelmaking. The second team was the logistics transportation team, specifically responsible for hauling grain and grass uphill and hauling coal and iron downhill. The third team was the long-distance transportation team, responsible for transporting materials in areas such as Xinjiang and Houma. The fourth team was the agricultural transportation team, specifically responsible for transporting fertilizer to farmland, launching shock autumn harvests, transporting wheat seeds, cotton, and scrap iron. After such arrangements were made for various transportation tools, the chaotic phenomena of the past were completely changed, greatly speeding up transportation and ensuring the needs of various tasks. For example, if a thousand clay pipes were needed on the mountain, a phone call was made that day, and they were delivered that day. If pig iron needed to be transferred from the foot of the mountain, the task of transferring 300 tons of pig iron was completed within two days, with no shortage of weight.

    After the transportation was organized, ideological education was strengthened, greatly enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses and greatly strengthening organization and discipline. At the same time, a technical innovation movement was launched, with everyone using their brains, everyone contributing ingenious ideas, boldly reforming tools, and improving transportation efficiency. The main methods were:

    1. Developing long-distance direct transportation. In order to reduce round-trip journeys, we adopted direct transportation. For example, Houma had 2 million tons of various fertilizers in stock. In the past, they were only transported to the urban area, and then transferred to various townships and communes. Now, townships such as Diantou and Yuancun, which are closer to Houma, haul scrap iron when they go and transport fertilizer when they return, directly transporting it to their respective communes, which is timely, saves money, and is a win-win situation.

    2. Flatbed carts converted to donkey power. In order to increase transportation capacity, the transportation company bought twelve donkeys, adding them to the original thirty-six short-distance flatbed carts, realizing the conversion of flatbed carts to donkey power. After a month of effort, they completed more than 1,500 tons of freight transportation, increasing the transportation volume by a factor of one.

    3. Opening mountains and repairing roads to shorten transportation mileage. Most of our mining areas are located within the Xiangning Mountains. From the urban area to Pangwang Temple is 70 kilometers, and the round trip also requires passing through the Xiangfen highway. We organized the masses to survey the mountain, engineers to determine the route, designing and constructing simultaneously, and built 16 kilometers of highway in one month, shortening the original route by 30 kilometers. At the same time, we mobilized miners from various townships to repair seven mine roads, with a total length of 35.5 kilometers.

    In the battle to vigorously grasp transportation, cadres and masses demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. One woman used to think that marrying a carter was humiliating enough, and she did not work hard. This time, she actively participated in pulling carts, each cart carrying more than 700 pounds. Such new events can be seen everywhere from the mountains to the valleys, from the cities to the countryside, which is truly countless. The masses sang: Iron cart battalion, motor vehicle company, set up a military station, set up a camp, organize a field army, thoroughly smash the transportation barrier throughout the year, everyone serves as a pioneer, going up the mountain and down to the fields is really convenient.

    大破运输关
    中共侯马市委副书记　高鸿基
    自从全民大办钢铁以后，山西新绛地区运输普遍紧张。据当时的运输任务，共需要载重三吨的汽车九万多车次。可是，全县的运输工具仅有机关厂矿的货运汽车十九辆，能用的只有九辆，再就是分散在各乡社的马车、铁轮大车、小平车三千二百多辆。很明显，运输能力远远满足不了运输量的需要。如何解决这个矛盾呢？县委研究以后，认为必须动员群众，贯彻“小土群”的方针。
    但是，当党委提出号召以后，发现少数人有抵触情绪。有些人瞧不起小土群，他们坐在办公室里死拨算盘子，越算越悲观。在他们看来，运输紧张无法改变，钢铁粮食不能同时跃进，必然是抓一个丢一个。还有些人目光短浅，缺乏整体观念，车辆调不动，坏了也不修，宁愿自己不用，也不愿支援钢铁生产。因此，不加强政治思想教育，共产主义思想树立不起来，运输紧张关就过不去。于是，县委组织全县干部和群众开展了一场大辩论。辩论结果，统一了思想，县委书记挂帅成立了指挥部，全县所有的运输工具统一指挥，统一调配，各乡党委第一书记也都亲自去抓运输工作。
    但是，由于组织不健全，管理制度不严，又出现了新的问题，就是混乱现象十分严重。有的大车出去九天不回来；有的大车原定任务是上山送粮，回来运铁，但结果是空去空回。因此后来我们就采取了固定车路、固定地点、固定任务、固定组织、分区运输的组织方法。划分了四支队伍，做了统一安排。第一支队伍为先头运输队，专供土高炉、土方炉炼钢铁运输煤炭、矿石。第二支队伍为后勤运输队，专负责上山拉粮草，下山拉煤铁。第三支队伍为长途运输队，负责新绛、侯马等地区的物资运输。第四支队伍为农运队，专负责农田送肥、突击秋收、麦种、运棉花和送废铁等工作。各种运输工具经过这种安排以后，就彻底改变了过去那种混乱现象，大大加快了运输速度，保证了各项工作的需要。例如，山上需要一千个泥管子，当天打电话，当天就送到了。山下需要调运生铁，就在两天时间内完成了生铁上调任务三百吨，斤两不短。
    运输组织起来以后，又加强了思想教育，群众的积极性大大提高，组织性纪律性大大加强。同时开展了技术革新运动，人人动脑筋，个个献妙计，大胆改革工具，提高了运输效率，主要办法是：
    一、发展长途直线运输。为了减少商品往返，我们采取了直线调运。如侯马积存各种肥料二百万吨，以往只运到城关，然后再往各乡社调运。现在让距离侯马较近的店头、原村等乡，去时拉上调的废钢铁，回来运肥料，直接运输到本社，又及时，又省钱，两全其美。
    二、平车毛驴化。运输连为了增加运输能力，买毛驴十二头，加上原有的三十六辆短途搬运平车，实现了平车毛驴化。经过一个月的努力，完成了一千五百多吨货运任务，运输量比以前增加了一倍。
    三、开山修路，缩短运输里程。我们矿区多数都在乡宁山内，从城关到竼王寺七十公里，往返还要经过襄汾公路。我们组织群众上山踏线，土工程师定线，边设计边施工，一个月修好十六公里公路，比原路线缩短三十公里。同时还发动各乡矿工修好七条矿路，全长三十五点五公里。
    在大抓运输的战斗中，干部和群众都表现了冲天的干劲。有一个妇女过去认为嫁给拉车的就够丢人啦，不好好劳动。这次她积极参加拉车，每车拉七百多斤。像这样的新事，从山上到山下，从城市到乡村，到处可以看到，真是举不胜举，群众歌唱道：铁车营，汽车连，设兵站，扎营盘，组织野战大兵团，全年大破运输关，人人都当先行官，上山下田真方便。
