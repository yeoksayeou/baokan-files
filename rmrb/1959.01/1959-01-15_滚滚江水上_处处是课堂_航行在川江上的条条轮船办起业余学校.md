Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 14th: More than fifty ships sailing day and night on the Sichuan River have established spare-time schools on board. Currently, these more than fifty spare-time schools on the ships, with their one hundred and ten-plus higher primary classes (including a few literacy consolidation classes) and twenty-six junior high classes, are generally able to maintain regular learning.

Among the more than five thousand crew members working on the Sichuan River ships, many are veteran sailors with one or two decades of experience, most of whom were illiterate or semi-literate in the past. Just after liberation, the illiteracy rate reached 75%. After eliminating illiteracy last year, the crew members were eager to improve their education. Due to the high mobility of the ships, with each round trip taking at least four or five days to more than half a month, most crew members were unable to participate in learning, despite the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration establishing full-time schools, employee training programs, and employee spare-time schools on shore. Considering this situation, the Chongqing Municipal Shipping Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) required the branch secretaries of each ship to take the lead in establishing schools on every ship and drafted a plan for running schools on ships. At that time, some grassroots cadres believed that ships moved frequently, and they had many central tasks to handle, so it would be difficult to run schools. Some thought that their own education level was low, and they were afraid that they would not be able to run schools well. Others believed that the party branch secretaries were already too busy with production and political movements, and they would not have time to run schools. After understanding these situations, the Party Committee, on the one hand, mobilized the masses to engage in extensive debates to discuss the necessity of running schools; on the other hand, they organized on-site meetings to introduce the experience of the "Yangtze No. 2009" tugboat in relying on the masses to run schools.

After debate and exchange of experiences, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for running schools greatly increased. Spare-time schools were quickly established on each ship, with the party branch secretary serving as the principal of the spare-time school. Under the leadership of the Party branch, representatives from the ship's administration, labor union, and Communist Youth League formed a school affairs committee, first making unified arrangements for production, study, and rest time. They studied the laws of ship navigation: which places required stopping at ports, when they might encounter dangerous shoals requiring the entire crew to operate, and changes in routes. Based on the laws of ship navigation, they made long-term plans and short-term arrangements. Most ships arranged learning according to the time of a round trip (a few arranged it on a weekly basis), with each person studying for one and a half to two hours per day. Based on the ship's three-shift work system, classes were held twice a day, so that crew members on early, noon, and late shifts could all participate in learning. Many ships also arranged two or more sets of learning schedules based on the length of the routes. When tasks were urgent and delayed learning, they used the time when ships were docked or undergoing repairs to make up for lessons.

Each ship only had forty to seventy people, with few workers having a high level of education. How was the problem of teachers solved? Each ship adopted the method used during the literacy campaign – those with higher education taught those with lower education, hiring "capable people" as teachers, and establishing a mass-based teaching force. The workers were both students and teachers themselves. Many party branch secretaries on the ships were political instructors; captains, chief engineers, and veteran workers were technical instructors, while they themselves were students in higher primary or junior high classes. Many junior high students were also cultural teachers in higher primary classes. Because these teachers were with the students all day, they understood the needs of the students best when lecturing, could combine theory with practice, and knew where it was necessary to explain things thoroughly.

In order to help the ships run schools well, the Chongqing Municipal Shipping Committee of the CCP also adopted a combination of centralized and decentralized methods. On the one hand, it held short-term training classes (ten to twenty days) to train key teachers; on the other hand, it sent full-time teachers from the shore to form working groups, stationed in important ports along the river, or went deep into the ships, to provide guidance to the workers and teachers on the ships and help them improve the quality of teaching.

### 滚滚江水上　处处是课堂  航行在川江上的条条轮船办起业余学校

    滚滚江水上　处处是课堂
    航行在川江上的条条轮船办起业余学校
    新华社重庆14日电　昼夜航行在川江上的五十多条轮船，条条船上都办起了业余学校。现在这些船上的五十多所业余学校的一百一十多个高小班（其中有少数扫盲巩固班）和二十六个初中班，一般都能坚持经常性的学习。
    在川江轮船上工作的五千多名船员，很多都是有一、二十年工龄的老船员，过去他们多数是文盲和半文盲。刚解放时，文盲的比例达到75％。去年扫除文盲后，船员们要求提高文化的心情十分迫切。因为轮船的流动性大，来往一趟起码要四、五天到半月以上。所以，虽然长江航运管理局重庆分局在岸上办起了全日制学校、职工脱产训练班和职工业余学校，大多数船员还是无法参加学习。考虑到这一情况，中共重庆市航运委员会要求各船的支部书记挂帅，在条条轮船上办学，并且拟订了一个船舶上办学的方案。当时，有部分基层干部认为船舶经常流动，中心任务又多，不好办学校；有的认为自己文化程度低，怕办不了学校；有的则认为党支部书记抓生产和抓政治运动都忙不过来，那有时间办学校？党委了解这些情形后，一边发动群众大鸣大放，讨论办学的必要性，一边组织现场会议，介绍“长江二○○九号”拖轮依靠群众办学的经验。
    经过辩论和经验交流，干部和群众办学的积极性大大提高，各条船上的业余学校很快就办起来了，并且都由党支部书记担任了业余学校校长；在党支部领导下，吸收船上行政、工会、共青团等组织的代表组成校务委员会，首先把生产与学习、休息的时间作了统一的安排。他们研究了轮船行驶的规律：那些地方要停港，那些时候可能遇到险滩需要全船人马出动操作，以及航线变化等情况。根据轮船行驶的规律，作出长计划和短安排。大多数的船是按来回一个航次的时间安排学习（有少数按星期来安排），每人每天学一小时半到两小时；并根据船上三班劳动的情况，每天分两次上课，不论早、午、晚班船员都能参加学习。许多船还按航线长、航线短的情况，安排了两套以上的学习时间表。遇到任务紧张，耽搁了学习时，就利用船只停泊或检修的时间集中补课。
    每条船上只有四十至七十人，文化程度高的职工较少。师资问题如何解决呢？各条船都采用扫盲时曾经运用过的办法——以高教低，聘请“能者”为师，建立了一支群众性的教师队伍。职工们自己是学员，又是教师。许多船上的党支部书记是政治课教员；船长、轮机长和老工人是技术课教员，同时他们自己又是高小班或初中班的学员。许多初中班的学员也是高小班的文化教师。这些教师因为成天和学员们在一起，所以讲课的时候最了解学员们的需要，能够结合实际，也懂得那些地方必要讲透。
    中共重庆市航运委员会为了帮助轮船办好学校，还采取集中和分散相结合的办法，一方面开办短期训练班（十天二十天的），培养骨干教师；一方面派岸上的专职教师组成工作组，驻在沿江重要港口，或深入船上，对船上的职工教师进行辅导，帮助他们提高教学质量。
