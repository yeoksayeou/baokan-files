    Tannin extract is a type of vegetable tanning agent, its main component being tannin. Various animal hides, such as cowhide and pigskin, must be tanned with tannin extract after hair removal to become strong, waterproof, rot-resistant, and elastic leather. In addition, tannin extract is also used as a water softener and for tanning and dyeing fishing nets.

    Many raw materials can be used to produce tannin extract, such as acorn cups, larch bark, spruce bark, pine needles, *Osmanthus fragrans* fruit, *Quercus variabilis* bark, sumac leaves, and mangrove bark, all of which contain vegetable tannins. The production process of tannin extract is very simple. The raw materials are first crushed to break the tannin-containing plant cells, and then repeatedly leached with clean water at a certain temperature for six to twelve hours to dissolve the tannin in the water. The solution is then extracted and boiled in a pot to concentrate it to a certain concentration, at which point it can be used. For ease of transport, it can also be heated and dried into a solid.

    In the past, some people believed that the production of tannin extract required a high level of technical expertise and that large factories had to be established for formal production. However, during the Great Leap Forward last year, many places in Jiangxi, Liaoning, Hunan, Shanxi, and Henan established small tannin extract factories and produced tannin extract using indigenous methods. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of 1958, there were more than 500 small tannin extract factories across the country, with an annual output of about 8,000 tons, more than three times the output in 1957.

    China is very rich in tannin extract resources. The forest areas of Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and other regions have large areas of larch forests. If the bark is fully utilized for tannin extraction, the estimated annual output could reach more than 80,000 tons. There are also large areas of spruce forests in the forest areas of Southwest and Xinjiang, and large areas of oak forests in the Central South region. If spruce bark and acorn cups are fully utilized, the annual output of tannin extract could be more than 60,000 tons. Other resources, such as *Quercus variabilis*, mangroves, lacquer trees, and *Osmanthus fragrans*, are also widely distributed. On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, and in accordance with the Party's proposed policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and launching a large-scale mass movement, we should make tannin extract production take another leap forward and fully utilize all tannin extract resources, so that China's tannin extract production can quickly not only be self-sufficient but also strive for export.

    栲胶
    栲胶是一种植物鞣料，它的主要成分是单宁。各种兽皮如牛皮、猪皮等经过脱毛之后，必须用栲胶鞣制，才能成为质量坚固、不透水、不易腐烂、富有弹性的皮革。除此以外，栲胶还用作软水剂和鞣染鱼网。
    制栲胶的原料很多，如橡椀子、落叶松树皮、云杉树皮、松树叶、花香树果、檞树皮、漆叶、红树皮等都含有植物单宁。制取栲胶的生产过程很简单，把栲胶原料先进行粉碎，使含单宁的植物细胞破裂，然后用清水在一定温度下反复浸提六到十二小时，使单宁质溶解于水，再提出溶液，放在锅里蒸煮浓缩到一定浓度，就可以使用。为了便于运输，也可以再加热干燥成固体。
    过去有些人认为生产栲胶必需要有较高的技术水平，要建立大工厂才能正式生产，去年在大跃进中，江西、辽宁、湖南、山西、河南等许多地方建立了小型栲胶工厂，用土法也生产出了栲胶。据不完全统计，到1958年底，全国有小型栲胶厂五百多个，年产量可达八千吨左右，比1957年增产了三倍以上。
    我国栲胶资源十分丰富，内蒙古、东北等林区有大面积的落叶松林，如将树皮全利用起来浸提栲胶，估计年产可达八万多吨。在西南、新疆林区也有大片云杉林，中南地区也有大片橡树林，如将云杉树皮和橡椀子全利用起来，每年可产栲胶约六万吨以上，其他如檞树、红树、漆树、花香树也分布很广。在去年大跃进的基础上，根据党所提出的土洋结合，大搞群众运动的方针，使栲胶生产再来一个更大的跃进，把所有栲胶资源都充分利用起来，就可以很快使我国栲胶生产不仅能够自给，而且能够争取出口。（附图片）
