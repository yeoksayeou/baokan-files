    What I Saw in the Bookstore
    Qin Li

    I have a habit of browsing bookstores, flipping through books here and there. After a while, I've noticed a problem.

    Some time ago, there was promotion of liberating thought and breaking down superstition. Many publishers compiled books on this topic for the masses to study, which is certainly a good thing. However, perhaps because "great minds think alike," everyone kept compiling the same few articles. One moment, one publisher releases a book, and upon inspection, it contains those same few articles. The next moment, another publisher releases a book, and upon inspection, it's still those same few articles. Then, two or three months later, another province or city releases a book. Surely it has new content, right? Upon inspection, it's still those same few articles! Even within the same province, the provincial publisher releases it, and then the municipal publisher releases it. In the same city, several publishers release it simultaneously or one after the other. Some publishers, clearly aware that others have already released it, and not just one but several, and for months already, still insist on releasing it themselves. As of the day I wrote this short article, I saw yet another newly released book from a municipal publisher.

    Is there a need to publish the same books repeatedly like this! How much manpower and material resources are wasted in the process! Is this problem unavoidable? I think, couldn't publishers and bookstores, publishers and publishers, strengthen their communication and exchange information? Wouldn't this save a lot of manpower and material resources to publish some new books and good books?

    It is necessary to publish booklets to cooperate with propaganda and study, and some repetition of materials is inevitable, but I think we must not overdo it and repeat it too much.

    书店所见
    秦犁
    我有逛书店的习惯，东翻西看；日子一久，倒也发现了一个问题。
    前些时候宣传解放思想，破除迷信，很多出版社都编了一些这方面的书供群众学习，这当然是件好事情。但是，也许是“英雄所见略同”吧，大家编来编去，老是那几篇文章。一会这个出版社出了一本，一看是那几篇文章；一会另一个出版社又出了一本，一看还是那几篇。再隔两个月，三个月，另外一个省或市又出了一本，大概有新东西了吧？一看，还是那几篇！甚至在同一个省里，省的出版社出了，市的出版社又出；在同一个市里，几家出版社都同时出或先后出。有的出版社明明已经看见别人出了，而且出的已不止一家，而且已经出了几月之久，但是自己还是要出。直到我写这篇短文的当天，又看到了一个市的出版社新出的一本。
    这样重复出书有必要么！这其间有多少人力和物力的浪费啊！难道这个问题竟是不可避免的？我想，出版社与书店之间，出版社与出版社之间，难道就不能加强联系，互通消息？这样不是就可以节省出很多人力物力来出版一些新书、好书么。
    出小册子配合宣传学习是需要的，有一部分材料重复也在所难免，但我认为千万不要出得太滥，重复太多。
