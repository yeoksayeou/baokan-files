According to the Zhejiang Daily, the rectification of communes in the suburbs of Hangzhou is unfolding from point to area. After the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee’s Rural Work Committee’s commune rectification work teams arrived at the various people's communes, they helped the commune Party committees hold meetings of production team leaders and above. They summarized experiences, affirmed achievements, unified understanding, boosted morale, and planned production and commune rectification work. On the other hand, they immediately went deep into one production team to conduct pilot projects, creating experience in how to fully mobilize the masses, launch a large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, and promote current production in the initial stage of commune rectification. In carrying out the first step of rectification, each pilot production team has centered on production, with all work revolving around production. Broadly speaking, they focused on two key links:

	Starting with Production
	First, they put forward clear production tasks and resounding mobilization slogans, calling on the masses to focus on production; and based on the tasks proposed, they mobilized the masses to formulate short-term production plans. For example, the Jiangkou Production Team of the Shangsi People’s Commune, based on the problems existing in current production, proposed "Apply liquid manure to wheat, barley, and rapeseed once within three days," and "Open ditches and cover with ash in the broad bean fields within three days."

	Second, after the production tasks were assigned, cadres immediately went deep into the fields, participating in production, inspecting production, and promptly helping to solve problems found in production, further pushing production to a new high. Because each pilot team centered its rectification work on production, the movement immediately set off a surge in production. For example, after a mass production inspection, the Tenth Production Team of the Gaotang Brigade of the Jianqiao Commune immediately organized the masses to fertilize and water 51 mu of vegetable fields lacking fertilizer and water, and collected more than 3,700 jin of discarded firewood and 250 jin of jute from the fields.

	Removing Ideological Concerns
	At the beginning of the rectification, some cadres and masses had different ideological concerns. Some cadres believed that current production and work were already very tight, and that rectification would affect production; a few cadres with shortcomings in their work style were afraid that their problems would be exposed, causing them to lose face; some cadres were also afraid that the masses would raise many problems that they would not be able to solve. Some of the masses were afraid that their opinions would not lead to solutions. In response to the ideological situation of the cadres and the masses, each pilot team conducted publicity and education to correct the attitudes of the cadres and dispel the concerns of the masses. The method of resolving the cadres' ideological concerns generally involved summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward over the past year, affirming the achievements of the work, and repeatedly explaining to the cadres that the large-scale inspection was for the purpose of improving the work and that it was good if they could earnestly conduct self-criticism and practically correct their shortcomings. In addition to publicizing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward over the past year, they emphasized to the masses that launching a large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters was for the purpose of consolidating the commune and improving production and livelihood, and that it was necessary to adhere to reason in the debate; they emphasized to the masses the determination to rectify, guaranteeing to listen carefully to the opinions raised by everyone, and to find ways to achieve whatever was feasible. After such education, the cadres and the masses generally dared to boldly express their views and actively write big-character posters.

	Inspiring the Masses to Express Views
	In order to facilitate the masses' large-scale airing of views, debates, and big-character posters, each pilot team adopted a variety of methods to quickly set off a mass upsurge in expressing views. The methods adopted by each team generally included the following: ① Setting up field-side airing stations, organizing literate people in the countryside to prepare pens, ink, and paper in the fields, and using the masses' rest time to write big-character posters on their behalf. ② Selecting commune members who were upright, fair-minded, and selfless to serve as "messengers," to whom anyone with opinions could express them. ③ Using fields, sideline production teams, and other production sites to organize the masses to express their views and debate during work breaks. ④ Using canteens or clubs to establish big-character poster rooms, airing gardens, and rectification gardens. ⑤ Holding forums for various classes (middle peasants, poor peasants) and systems (youth, women, elderly) to provide inspiration and guidance and mobilize them to express their views. Because a variety of methods were adopted to inspire the masses to express their views and facilitate them, an upsurge in expressing views quickly formed, with great effect. The opinions expressed by the masses involved all aspects of the commune. Some praised the superiority of the people's commune and the Great Leap Forward of the past year; some praised good people and good deeds; some offered opinions on the commune's distribution, production management, welfare, cadre work style, and other issues. These many opinions played a great role in promoting production and systematically carrying out commune rectification.

	How to Solve Problems
	During the airing of views, the masses raised many opinions and reflected many problems. Where should one start to solve them? Summarizing the practices of the various pilot projects, the following two points were generally noted: First, priority was given to solving the problems that the masses were most concerned about. Judging from the situation of the various pilot projects, the issue that the masses were currently most concerned about was the issue of distribution. The most opinions were expressed on this point. In summary, there were two main aspects: One was the request for faster distribution so that they could buy more things to prepare for the Spring Festival; the other was the request for reasonable distribution. In addition to the issue of distribution, the masses were also very concerned about livelihood issues, mainly the issue of heating in the canteens and the issue of winter provisions for the elderly and children. Second, while focusing on key issues for rectification, problems that did not require much effort and could be solved immediately should be solved immediately. For example, some of the masses in the Gaotang Brigade of the Jianqiao Commune had to go around a small river to eat in the canteen, which was very inconvenient every day. If a simple bridge were built over the small river, this half-mile distance could be avoided. Such problems could be solved quickly as long as the leadership paid attention to them.

At present, the initial experiences of the pilot projects have been promoted throughout the suburbs, and the rectification work in the entire suburbs has been fully launched. Each pilot commune is focusing on the issue of distribution, which the masses are most concerned about, mobilizing the masses to specially air their views and debate, and properly resolving it.

    围绕生产进行整社
    杭州郊区全面推广试点经验
    据浙江日报消息　杭州市郊区的整社工作正在由点到面地展开。中共杭州市委农委的整社工作队到达各人民公社以后，一方面帮助公社党委开好生产队长以上干部会议，总结经验，肯定成绩，统一认识，鼓足干劲，部署生产和整社工作；另一方面立即深入到一个生产队进行试点，创造在整社初期如何充分发动群众、开展大放大鸣、推动当前生产的经验。各试点生产队在开展整社的第一步工作时，都做到了以生产为中心，一切工作围绕着生产进行。大体上是抓住了两个环节：
      从生产入手
    第一，提出明确的生产任务和响亮的鼓动口号，号召群众以搞好生产；并且根据提出的任务，发动群众制订出小段生产计划。像上泗人民公社江口生产队，就根据当前生产中存在的问题，提出“三天内把大小麦、油菜施上一次清水粪”“在三天内把蚕豆田开好沟，盖好灰”。
    第二，在生产任务布置下去以后，干部立即深入田间，参加生产，检查生产，发现生产中有问题就迅速帮助解决，把生产进一步推向高潮。各个试点队由于以生产为中心进行整社，因此运动一开始就掀起了生产高潮。例如笕桥公社皋塘大队第十生产队，经过群众性的生产大检查，立即组织群众把五十一亩缺肥、缺水的菜地施了肥、浇了水，收拾了丢在田头的柴草三千七百多斤和络麻二百五十斤。
    解除思想顾虑
    整社开始时，部分干部和群众存在着不同的思想顾虑。一部分干部认为当前生产和工作很紧张，整社要影响生产；少数工作作风有缺点的干部怕问题揭出来，面子上过不去；也有的干部怕群众提出许多问题，自己解决不了。部分群众怕提了意见不解决问题。针对干部、群众的思想情况，各试点队都通过宣传教育，分别端正了干部的态度，解除了群众的顾虑。解决干部思想顾虑的办法，一般是通过总结一年来大跃进的经验，肯定工作成绩，反复向干部说明大检查是为了改进工作，自己工作中有缺点，只要能够认真地进行自我批评，切实改正就是好的。对群众，除了宣传一年来大跃进的成绩以外，着重说明开展大鸣大放大辩论是为了巩固公社，搞好生产与生活，辩论中一定要坚持说理；着重向群众表明整改的决心，保证认真听取大家提出的意见，凡是条件许可的，立即想办法做到。经过这样的教育以后，干部、群众一般都能大胆地鸣放，积极写大字报。
    启发群众鸣放
    为了便于群众大放大鸣大辩论和写大字报，各试点队都采取了多种多样的方法，迅速地掀起了群众性的鸣放高潮。各队采取的方法，大体上有这样几种：①在田头设立了田头鸣放站，组织农村中能写的人，在田头地角准备好笔墨纸张，利用群众休息的时间，代写大字报。②推选出为人正派、大公无私的社员，担任“传递员”，谁有意见就可以向他去反映。③利用田头地角、副业组等生产的场地，在劳动休息的空隙，组织群众鸣放辩论。④利用食堂或俱乐部建立大字报室、鸣放园地、整改园地。⑤召开各阶层（中农、贫农）各系统（青年、妇女、老年）的座谈会，进行启发引导，动员他们大放大鸣。由于采取了多种多样的方法启发群众鸣放，便利群众鸣放，因此很快就形成了鸣放高潮，收效很大。群众鸣放的意见，涉及到公社各个方面的问题。有的歌颂人民公社的优越性，歌颂一年来的大跃进；有的表扬好人好事；有的是对于公社的分配、生产管理、生活福利、干部作风等问题提出意见。这许多意见对于推动生产、系统进行整社都有很大作用。
    怎样解决问题
    在鸣放中，群众提了许多意见，反映了很多问题，究竟从何处入手来解决呢？综合各试点的做法，一般是注意了以下两点：第一，首先解决群众最关心的问题。从各个试点的情况来看，群众当前最关心的问题是分配问题。在这一点上鸣放的意见最多。归纳起来主要是两方面：一是要求快一点分，好添置一点东西，准备过春节；二是要求分配得合理。除了分配问题外，群众还十分关心生活问题，主要是食堂的保暖问题，老年和儿童的过冬问题等。第二，在抓住重点进行整改的同时，对那些不需要花很多力量而马上就可以解决的问题，应该立即解决。像笕桥公社皋塘大队有一部分群众到食堂吃饭时要绕过一条小河，每天来回很不方便，如果在小河上搭一座便桥，这半里路就可以不走了。类似这样的问题，只要领导重视起来，很快就可以解决。
    目前，试点的初步经验已在全郊区推广，全郊区的整社工作已全面展开。各试点社正抓住群众最关心的分配问题，发动群众专题鸣放、辩论，妥善予以解决。
