Farmers and Herdsmen Form a Commune: Comprehensive Development of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
Ethnic Groups in Three Communes in Urumqi County Cooperate Closely and Advance Hand in Hand
Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, January 16th: The Urumqi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the demands of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups, reorganized the county's thirty-one agricultural cooperatives and twenty-eight pastoral cooperatives into three integrated agricultural-pastoral people's communes during the people's commune movement. This resolved long-standing agricultural and pastoral contradictions, closely integrated agriculture and animal husbandry, improved cooperation between mountainous and plain areas, facilitated the development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and promoted the settlement of herdsmen. As a result, farmers of Han, Hui, Uyghur, and other ethnicities engaged in agricultural production, and herdsmen of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and other ethnicities engaged in animal husbandry, have further strengthened their friendly cooperative relations in production and life.

Urumqi County is one of the twenty-seven semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral counties in Xinjiang. The county has seven agricultural townships and seven pastoral townships, totaling 8,510 households, with farmers and herdsmen each accounting for half. The pastoral townships are located in the Tianshan pastures with rolling hills, possessing 260,000 head of livestock and cultivating over 40,000 mu of land. The agricultural townships are located on both sides of the rivers in the basin embraced by the Tianshan Mountains, possessing 150,000 mu of land and managing animal husbandry with over 40,000 head of livestock. The agricultural townships and pastoral townships are adjacent to each other and interwoven. Furthermore, the spring and autumn pastures of the pastoral areas are near the agricultural areas, and the winter and summer pastures of some livestock in the agricultural areas must borrow grassland from the pastoral areas. Therefore, for a long time, there have been contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry, and disputes have frequently occurred between the various ethnic groups engaged in agriculture and the various ethnic groups engaged in animal husbandry, affecting the unity between ethnic groups.

Last year, after agricultural areas realized advanced agricultural cooperativization and pastoral areas achieved elementary animal husbandry cooperativization, the county adjusted over 10,000 mu of land from agricultural areas to pastoral areas and adjusted over 20,000 head of livestock's winter and summer pastures from pastoral areas to agricultural areas, to adapt to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and ethnic relations have been further improved. However, this cooperation only solved some problems between agricultural cooperatives and pastoral cooperatives, and some problems have not been resolved. When farmers choose wasteland for reclamation, they often do not consider livestock transfer routes and drinking water locations comprehensively; when herdsmen transfer herds, they do not pay enough attention to protecting crops along the way. Therefore, both sides are unhappy.

Under these circumstances, farmers and herdsmen began to have a common feeling: if agricultural cooperatives and pastoral cooperatives could be merged together to study agricultural and pastoral production comprehensively, all problems could be solved. In addition, after the policy of running industry by the whole people was proposed, new contradictions arose in the county: pastoral areas generally have abundant reserves of coal, iron, copper, gold, and other minerals, and have abundant labor and livestock transportation power, but the annual income of each pastoral cooperative is generally only 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, with little public accumulation. Agricultural cooperatives generally have an income of 150,000 to 300,000 yuan, with more public accumulation, but lack labor and transportation power. In addition to using their own mares as draft animals, they also rent hundreds of draft horses and cattle from pastoral areas every year.

Due to the above reasons, from the very beginning of the people's commune movement in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, farmers and herdsmen in Urumqi County, farmers of Han, Hui, Uyghur, and other ethnicities, and herdsmen of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and other ethnicities, unanimously demanded that agricultural cooperatives and pastoral cooperatives be merged together to establish people's communes. After more than ten days of preparation, three months ago, they were reorganized into the "East Wind," "Red Flag," and "Tianshan" people's communes.

At the beginning of the commune's establishment, just as heavy snow fell, half of the more than 190,000 mu of crops sown in the county were still growing in the fields. Hundreds and thousands of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Mongolian herdsmen, who had completed their winter grass storage tasks, rode tall horses, holding sickles, and rushed to the agricultural areas to harvest the crops, and completed the harvest and transportation before the snow. In the past, the pastoral areas had never been self-sufficient in grain. In addition, the pastoral areas did not have mills, and many herdsmen ate whole roasted wheat. Because the wheat was not enough, they had to slaughter some livestock as staple food. Now, the agricultural areas have sent dry mills, and the herdsmen can grind flour to eat. The parts that are insufficient in grain are uniformly allocated by the agricultural areas. The farmers reflected: if it were not for the great strength of the people's commune, the crops would probably have been buried in the ground by the snow; the herdsmen reflected: from now on, they will never have to worry about growing land and eating. Because the land is cultivated uniformly, the herdsmen are extra careful when transferring to autumn pastures, and they remind each other: "Pay attention! This land is already our own land, be careful that the livestock trample the crops." Each commune selects farmers with rich farming experience to uniformly lead agricultural and pastoral production. They select herdsmen with rich grazing experience to uniformly lead livestock production. The large amount of fertilizer in the pastoral areas can supply the agricultural areas, and the large amount of feed in the agricultural areas can also supply the pastoral areas.

The joint establishment of people's communes by farmers and herdsmen has also provided conditions for the settlement of herdsmen of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and other ethnicities. The county has been advocating the settlement of nomadic herdsmen since 1956, but because the land in the settlements in the pastoral areas is narrow, there is little water, and transportation is inconvenient, the settlements are scattered, and herdsmen still feel inconvenience in developing feed bases and cultural and welfare undertakings after settling down. Now, settlements suitable for herdsmen have been selected in the agricultural areas near the pastoral areas, and housing construction has begun. Because herdsmen can achieve settlement, it creates favorable conditions for the development of cultural and welfare undertakings in pastoral areas.

In November last year, farmers and herdsmen throughout the county received the task of iron smelting and quickly established steel bases in Sharchok, Donggou, Heijiagou, and other places, and established a copper smelting base in Chaiwobao. The friendship between ethnic groups has also become closer in the process of iron and copper smelting. In addition to completing the task of one hundred tons of iron, they also smelted 9.7 tons of miscellaneous copper and crude copper. (Attached picture)

### 农牧民结成一社　农牧业全面发展

    农牧民结成一社　农牧业全面发展
    乌鲁木齐县三个公社的各族人民亲密合作携手并进
    本报乌鲁木齐16日电　中共乌鲁木齐县委会根据各民族农牧民的要求，在人民公社运动中，把全县三十一个农业社和二十八个牧业社改组成三个农牧结合的人民公社，解决了过去长期不能完全解决的农牧业矛盾，使得农业和畜牧业紧密结合，山区与平原更好的协作，便利了工农牧业的发展，促进了牧民定居。这样，全县从事农业生产的汉、回、维吾尔等族农民，和从事畜牧业生产的哈萨克、柯尔克孜、蒙古等族牧民，便进一步从生产上、生活上密切了友爱合作的关系。
    乌鲁木齐县是新疆二十七个半农半牧业县中的一个县份。全县七个农业乡和七个牧业乡，共八千五百一十户，农牧民各占半数。牧业乡位于三面山岭起伏的天山牧场中，拥有二十六万头牲畜，兼种四万多亩土地。农业乡位于天山怀抱的盆地内河流两岸，拥有十五万亩土地，兼营四万多头牲畜的牧业。农业乡与牧业乡相互接壤、犬牙交错，加以牧区春秋两季牧场在农业区附近，农业区部分牲畜的冬夏两季牧场，必须借用牧区的草场，因此，长期以来，这里的农业与牧业存在着矛盾，从事农业的几个民族和从事畜牧业的几个民族经常发生纠纷，影响民族间的团结。
    去年，这个县农牧区分别实现了农业的高级合作化和畜牧业的初级合作化以后，为适应农牧业的发展，农业地区曾经为牧区调剂了一万多亩土地；牧区也为农业区调剂了两万多头牲畜的冬夏牧场，民族关系也得到了进一步改善。但是，这种协作只解决了农业社与牧业社之间的一些问题，有些问题还没有得到解决。农民在选择荒地垦荒时，往往对牲畜转移道路和饮水地点考虑不周；牧民转移畜群时，对保护沿途庄稼也注意不够，因此，双方都不愉快。
    在这种情况下，农民和牧民开始产生一种共同感觉：如果农业社和牧业社能够合并在一起，通盘研究农牧业生产，一切问题都能解决了。加上全民办工业的方针提出以后，这个县又产生了新的矛盾：牧区一般都蕴藏着丰富的煤、铁、铜、金等矿藏，有富裕的劳动力和畜力运输力量，但是每个牧业社的全年收入一般只有五万元到十万元，公共积累少。农业社一般收入达十五万元到三十万元，公共积累多，但劳动力和运输力缺乏，他们每年除把自用的母马作役畜使用外，还租用牧区几百匹役马役牛。
    由于上述种种原因，新疆维吾尔自治区农业地区人民公社运动一开始，乌鲁木齐县的农民和牧民，汉、回、维吾尔等族农民和哈萨克、柯尔克孜、蒙古等族牧民，都一致要求把农业社和牧业社合并一起建立人民公社。经过十多天酝酿，在三个月前，改组成“东风”、“红旗”和
  “天山”三个人民公社。
    公社成立之初，正当大雪降临，全县播种的十九万多亩庄稼有半数庄稼还在地里长着，于是成百上千的储完了冬草任务的哈萨克、柯尔克孜和蒙古族的牧民，骑着高头大马、拿着搧镰赶到农业地区抢收庄稼，并在雪前赶收赶运完毕。过去牧区粮食一直不能自给，加以牧区没有磨房，不少牧民都是炒囫囵麦子吃，因麦子不够，不得不宰杀一部分牲畜当主食。现在农业区送去了旱磨，牧民可以磨面粉吃，粮食不足的部分，由农业区统一调拨。农民反映说：要不是人民公社力量大，庄稼恐怕已被雪埋在地里了；牧民反映说：从今后种地吃饭再也不发愁了。由于土地统一耕种，牧民在转移秋季牧场时格外小心，他们互相提醒说：“注意！这里的土地已是我们自己的土地，当心牲畜踏坏庄稼。”每个公社都选出富有农作经验的农民统一领导农牧民进行农业生产。选出富有牧放经验的牧民，统一领导畜牧业生产。牧区的大量肥料可以供应农业区，农业区的大量饲料也可以供应牧区。
    农牧民联合成立人民公社，也给哈萨克、柯尔克孜、蒙古等族牧民的定居提供了条件。这个县从1956年就提倡牧民定居游牧，但由于牧区定居点土地窄、水少、交通不便，因此定居点分散，牧民要在定居后发展饲料基地以及文化福利事业，仍然感到不便。现在，适合于牧民的定居点已在接近牧区的农业地区选择出来，并且开始建筑房屋。由于牧民能够实现定居，给牧区发展文化福利事业创造了有利条件。
    去年11月间，全县农牧民接到了炼铁的任务，迅速在沙尔乔克、东沟、黑家沟等地建立了钢铁基点，在柴窝堡建立了炼铜基点。民族之间友谊也在炼铁炼铜过程中，更进一步亲密起来了。他们除完成了一百吨铁的任务外，还炼了九点七吨杂铜和粗铜。（附图片）
