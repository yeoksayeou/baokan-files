Editorial Notes:

    Manage Winter Green Manure Well
    “One year of red clover, three years of good soil.” This is the fair evaluation of winter green manure by farmers in the southern rice-growing areas.
    Green manure crops are now in the growth stage, so they can be said to be a kind of "living fertilizer." The level of their unit yield will vary depending on how well people manage them. How can we get these "living fertilizers" to contribute more to this year's greater leap forward in agriculture? This is an important task in the manure accumulation campaign in green manure planting areas.
    Jiangsu has put forward the goal of striving for a per-mu yield of 10,000 jin of fresh green manure grass and has formulated active measures to increase production, which is very necessary. Only in this way can its "living" role be fully utilized.

    管好冬季绿肥
    “一年红花草，三年好地脚。”这是南方水稻区农民对冬季绿肥的公正的评价。
    绿肥作物现在正在生长阶段，因此可以说是一种“活的肥料”。它的单位产量的高低，将根据人们对它的管理的好坏而变化。怎样才能叫这些“活的肥料”为今年的农业更大跃进多出些力呢？这是种植绿肥地区积肥运动中的一项重要工作。
    江苏提出争取绿肥亩产万斤鲜草的指标，并且订了积极的增产措施，这是十分必要的。因为只有这样，才能充分发挥它的“活”的作用。
