Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: According to reports from various American news agencies, the Cuban rebel army, supported by people from all walks of life in Cuba, had taken control of all of Cuba's territory by the 2nd. Havana, the capital of Cuba, was occupied after a bloody battle involving tanks and artillery by Castro's field forces. Prior to this, a rebel army unit led by Carlos Escalona had occupied Pinar del Río city, the capital of Cuba's westernmost province of Pinar del Río.

During the battle to capture Havana, the rebel army annihilated the Batista guard, known as the "Tigers," consisting of 900 men. This guard had been notorious for brutally suppressing peaceful residents who sympathized with the rebel army during the dictatorship era.

The rebel army's entry into Havana was enthusiastically welcomed by local residents. It was reported that about five thousand workers gathered in the city's Central Park yesterday evening to welcome the arrival of the rebel army, with armed militia maintaining order in the park.

Xinhua News Agency: Workers and other masses in Havana, the capital of Cuba, actively participated in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the Batista dictatorship.

It is reported that in order to help quickly destroy the dictatorial rule and welcome the arrival of the Cuban rebel army, the working class of Havana held a general strike. The Cuban People's Socialist Party issued a declaration supporting the general strike. Many trade unions and various mass organizations also announced their support for the strike.

The entire city of Havana's transportation and telecommunications were halted due to the workers' general strike. Workers at the foreign-owned Esso and Shell oil refineries also participated in the strike. All airports in Havana were closed to traffic and occupied by the militia in order to prevent possible escapes by officials of the Batista dictatorship. The militia was also responsible for guarding and protecting all banks, thereby preventing any attempts by Batista officials to withdraw funds and abscond. Havana's newspapers ceased publication due to the workers' strike. Two reactionary newspapers—"Alerta" and "El Diario de la Marina"—were shut down. The National Workers' United Front held a large-scale demonstration in Havana's Central Park on the afternoon of the 2nd to express support for the nomination of Urrutia as the provisional president of Cuba.

Many trade unions also overthrew the leading bodies controlled by the dictatorship's henchmen. Grand demonstrations were held to support the revolutionary movement and oppose the dictatorship. Under the pressure of the workers' surging fighting spirit, Eusebio Mujal, the general secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, a stooge of the Batista dictatorship, fled in panic to the Argentine Embassy to hide.

The young students of Havana also actively participated in the struggle to overthrow the Batista dictatorship. After receiving weapons, thousands of university students immediately organized patrols to help maintain order in the city.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Havana report: In the period before and after the collapse of the rule of Cuban dictator Batista, some Cuban ambassadors to foreign countries announced their resignations or declared their allegiance to the Cuban rebel army, and some were taken over by sympathizers of the rebel army.

It is reported that the Cuban envoys who have resigned include the Cuban Ambassador to Argentina, Alberto Espinosa, Ambassador to the United States Nicolas Arroyo, and Ambassador to Portugal Francisco de Miranda. The Cuban Ambassadors to West Germany and France have announced their allegiance to the Cuban rebel army. Cuban Ambassador to France de Ayora said in a communique issued on the evening of the 1st that after reaching an agreement with Asina, a friend and partner of rebel leader Castro exiled in Paris, he had decided to ask the French government to "immediately recognize the new regime established in Cuba under the leadership of Urrutia." Urrutia is the president of the new government that the Cuban rebel army has announced it will establish.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The great victory won by the Cuban people has greatly alarmed the Wall Street ruling group. The U.S. government is frantically taking emergency measures in an attempt to intervene in the situation in Cuba.

Under the pretext of so-called "evacuation of expatriates," five U.S. government warships have sailed to the Cuban coast to put pressure on the Cuban rebel army. It is reported that a spokesman for the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that this action was taken at the "request" of the State Department. The spokesman also implied that if "necessary," these U.S. warships would enter Cuban ports to carry out "evacuation" missions. (Attached picture)

    古巴起义军攻下首都控制全境
    人民热烈欢迎起义部队积极参加推翻反动政权的斗争
    美国手忙脚乱派军舰五艘开到古巴海岸企图进行干涉
    新华社3日讯　据美国各通讯社报道，得到古巴各阶层人民支持的古巴起义军已经在2日控制了古巴的全部领土。古巴的首都哈瓦那是在卡斯特罗的野战部队经过一次有坦克和大炮参加的流血战斗以后被占领的。在这以前，由卡洛斯·埃斯卡洛纳率领的一支起义军部队占领了古巴最西面的省份比那尔德里奥的省会比那尔德里奥市。
    在攻克哈瓦那的战斗中，起义军歼灭了由九百人组成的号称“老虎”的巴蒂斯塔近卫军。这批近卫军曾经躲在中央公园地区的一幢房子里进行顽抗。据报道，这个近卫军在独裁政权年代是以残酷镇压那些同情起义军的和平居民而出名的。
    进入哈瓦那市内的起义军受到了当地居民的热烈欢迎。据报道，约五千名工人昨日傍晚集合在市内的中央公园，迎接起义军的到来，并由武装的民兵维持公园秩序。
    据新华社讯　古巴首都哈瓦那的劳动者及其他阶层群众积极地参加了推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的革命斗争。
    据报道，为了帮助迅速摧毁独裁的统治和迎接古巴起义军的到来，哈瓦那的工人阶级曾经举行总罢工。古巴人民社会党发表了宣言，支持这次总罢工。许多工会以及各种群众团体也都宣布支持罢工。
    哈瓦那整个城市的交通和电讯联络由于工人的总罢工而宣告停止。外国资本的埃索石油公司和壳牌石油公司炼油厂的工人也参加了这次罢工斗争。哈瓦那的各个机场都停止了通航并为民兵所占领，以便制止巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的官员可能的逃跑。民兵还负责守卫和保护一切银行，从而防止了巴蒂斯塔官员提款潜逃的任何企图。哈瓦那的报纸因工人的罢工而停刊。其中两家反动报纸——“警觉报”和“晨报”——遭到封闭。全国工人统一战线2日下午在哈瓦那的中央公园举行了一次规模巨大的示威，表示拥护提名乌鲁蒂亚为古巴临时总统。
    许多工会并且推翻了为独裁政权的走狗所掌握的领导机构。举行了盛大的示威游行，支持革命运动，反对独裁政权。在工人高涨斗争情绪的威迫下，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的走狗古巴劳工联合会总书记、欧塞比奥·穆哈尔狼狈地跑到阿根廷大使馆去躲藏起来。
    哈瓦那的青年学生也积极参加了这次推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的斗争。千百名大学生在领取了武器以后，立即组织了巡逻队帮助维持城市的秩序。
    新华社3日讯　哈瓦那消息：在古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔的统治宣告垮台的前后，古巴驻外的一些使馆的大使纷纷宣布辞职或者宣布归顺古巴起义军，有的被起义军同情者接管。
    据报道，已经辞职的古巴驻外使节有古巴驻阿根廷大使艾贝托·埃斯皮诺萨。驻美国大使尼古拉斯·阿罗约。驻葡萄牙大使弗朗西斯科·德米兰达。宣布归附古巴起义军的有古巴驻西德和驻法国的大使。古巴驻法国大使德阿约拉在1日晚发表的公报说，在同流亡在巴黎的起义军领袖卡斯特罗的朋友和伙伴阿西纳取得一致意见后，已经决定要求法国政府“立即承认在乌鲁蒂亚主持下在古巴建立的新政权”。乌鲁蒂亚是古巴起义军宣布将要成立的新政府的总统。
    新华社3日讯　古巴人民所获得的巨大胜利使华尔街统治集团大为恐慌，美国政府正在手忙脚乱地采取应急措施，企图干预古巴的局势。
    在所谓“撤退侨民”的借口下，美国政府的五艘军舰已经开到古巴海岸，对古巴起义军部队施加压力。据报道，美国海军部的一个发言人在昨天宣布说，这一行动是根据国务院的“要求”而采取的。这位发言人并且暗示，如果有“必要”这些美国军舰将进入古巴港口执行“撤侨”任务。（附图片）
