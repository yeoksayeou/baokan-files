Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch from Zomba: One hundred and fifty Africans in Nyasaland demonstrated in front of the Zomba police station on the evening of the 20th, demanding the release of thirty-two women who had been detained. These women were arrested for parading and refusing to disperse.

Six Africans participating in the demonstration were arrested.

Before they held their demonstration, a leader of the Nyasaland African National Congress delivered a speech to them.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from Salisbury: The Vice-Chairman of the Southern Rhodesian African National Congress, Chikerema, condemned Southern Rhodesia on the 18th as a police state. He said that the situation in Southern Rhodesia was very similar to that in the Belgian Congo, and if a violent revolution were to break out in Central Africa, it would start in Southern Rhodesia first.

Chikerema also revealed at a mass rally in Salisbury on the 18th, attended by more than 1,200 people, that before the riots occurred in the Congo, the Belgian colonial authorities had detained one million political prisoners in concentration camps in the Congo. The mass rally decided to protest the British and Rhodesian governments’ expulsion of Hastings Banda, Chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, from Southern and Northern Rhodesia.

The conference also called on the British government to immediately dissolve the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. This federation, also known as the Central African Federation, was established by Britain against the will of the local people in order to maintain its rule over Central Africa.

    抗议殖民当局的镇压行动
    尼亚萨兰非洲人举行示威
    南罗得西亚人民集会要求解散中非联邦
    新华社21日讯　松巴消息：尼亚萨兰的一百五十名非洲人20日晚上在松巴警察局前举行示威，要求释放被拘禁的三十二名妇女。这些妇女因列队游行和拒绝解散而遭到逮捕。
    有六名参加示威的非洲人被捕。
    在他们举行示威以前，尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的一位领袖曾经向他们发表了演说。
    新华社19日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会副主席契克雷马在18日谴责南罗得西亚是一个警察国家。他说，南罗得西亚的情况跟比属刚果的情况很相似，如果中非爆发暴力革命，首先将从南罗得西亚开始。
    契克雷马18日在索耳兹伯里举行的一次有一千二百多人参加的群众大会上还揭露，在刚果发生暴动以前，比利时殖民当局在刚果的集中营里拘留了一百万名政治犯。这次群众大会决定抗议英国和罗得西亚的政府把尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席黑斯廷斯·班达逐出南、北罗得西亚。
    大会还呼吁英国政府立即解散罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦。这个联邦又称作中非联邦，是英国为了维持它对中非的统治而违反当地人民的意志所建立起来的。
