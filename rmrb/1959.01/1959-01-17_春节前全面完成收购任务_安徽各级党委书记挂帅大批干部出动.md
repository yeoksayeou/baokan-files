Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 16th January. Party secretaries at all levels in Anhui Province are personally taking command, deploying large numbers of cadres, and strengthening leadership at each level, requiring the comprehensive completion of the procurement tasks for agricultural and sideline products before the Spring Festival.

In the previous period, Anhui Province adopted a method combining regular procurement with concentrated efforts for a short period of intensive procurement, and has already exceeded the state-allocated annual procurement targets for grain, cotton, live pigs, flue-cured tobacco, and tea. However, the progress of procurement varies from region to region and product to product, and products that should have been procured have not been completely procured. Therefore, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural and municipal committees and issued instructions, requiring all localities to seize the procurement work before the Spring Festival and comprehensively complete the procurement tasks for rural products.

Provincial administrative organs and party and government leading departments below the prefectural level have already taken active action. The Provincial Department of Commerce and the Grain Department have recently made specific arrangements for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. The Department of Commerce has also dispatched more than 50 cadres to various places to assist in procurement. Party and government organs below the prefectural level have taken measures to implement the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and have mobilized a large number of cadres to strengthen the procurement of agricultural and sideline products at each level. For example, Anqing Prefecture has dispatched more than 2,000 cadres to arrange the lives of the masses on the one hand and procure agricultural and sideline products on the other. In Lu'an Prefecture, a key hemp-producing area, in order to complete the task of procuring 80,000 dan of hemp before the Spring Festival, more than 1,500 professional teams with a total of more than 28,000 people have been organized to specifically peel hemp. After strengthening cotton procurement in Xiao County, the daily procurement of seed cotton has recently jumped from about 20 dan in the past to about 500 dan.

    春节前全面完成收购任务
    安徽各级党委书记挂帅大批干部出动
    新华社合肥16日电　安徽省各级党委书记亲自挂帅，抽调大批干部，层层加强领导，要求在春节前全面完成农副产品的收购任务。
    安徽省各地在前一个时期，采取经常收购和在短时期内集中较多的力量突击收购相结合的办法，已超额完成国家分配的粮食、棉花、生猪、烤烟、茶叶的全年收购任务。但是，在地区上、品种上收购进度快慢不一，应该收购上来的还没有完全收购上来。因此，中共安徽省委近来曾召集地委、市委书记开会并发出指示，要求各地在春节以前抓紧收购工作，全面地完成农村产品的收购任务。
    省级行政机关和专区以下党政领导部门已经积极行动起来。省商业厅和粮食厅最近分别对农副产品的收购工作作了具体部署。商业厅还抽出了五十多个干部到各地协助收购。专区以下的党政机关都采取了措施，贯彻省委的指示，并且调集大批干部逐级加强农副产品的收购工作。如安庆专区就抽调了干部二千多人，一面安排群众生活，一面收购农副产品。麻类重点产区六安专区，为了完成在春节前收购八万担大麻的任务，已经组织一千五百多个专业队共二万八千多人专门剥麻。萧县加强棉花收购以后，近来每天收购籽棉由过去的二十担左右跃增到五百担左右。
