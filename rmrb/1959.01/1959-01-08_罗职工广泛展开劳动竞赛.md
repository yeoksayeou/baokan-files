Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 6th. Inspired by the 1959 national economic development plan, workers in Romanian factories and enterprises are holding meetings to discuss this year's production tasks and are launching extensive socialist labor emulation campaigns.

    Engineers, technicians, and workers in many enterprises have put forward many rationalization proposals at production meetings. Saving raw materials and increasing labor productivity are the central themes of these proposals. Workers at the Soleks Mechanical Repair Factory in the capital have proposed that each person save at least 1,000 lei (Romanian currency) in production each month. Workers at the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Chemical Plant suggested that each worker should have at least one invention or solve a valuable problem in their work department each year. Workers in many factories have expressed enthusiastic support for this initiative.

    Since the first day of the new year, many factories have launched enthusiastic socialist labor emulation drives.

    罗职工广泛展开劳动竞赛
    新华社布加勒斯特6日电　罗马尼亚各工厂、企业的职工们在1959年国民经济发展计划的鼓舞下，正在纷纷举行会议讨论今年的生产任务，展开广泛的社会主义劳动竞赛。
    许多企业的工程师、技师和工人们在生产会议上提出了许多合理化建议。节约原材料和提高劳动生产率是这些建议的中心内容。首都的索勒克斯机械修配厂的工人倡议每人每月在生产中至少节约一千列伊（罗币名）。乔治乌—德治化学工厂的工人建议每个劳动者每年至少要在自己工作部门，有一项创造发明或解决一个有价值的问题。许多工厂的工人们都对这项倡议表示热烈响应。
    从新年的第一天开始，许多工厂就展开了热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛。
