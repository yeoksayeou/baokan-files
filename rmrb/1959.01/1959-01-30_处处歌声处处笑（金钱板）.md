The Spring Festival arrives with a fresh atmosphere,
Every household is full of smiles,
No matter in the countryside or in the city,
Everywhere is filled with joyful sounds.
The big red couplets are pasted straight,
The black characters are shining bright,
The top line is an overwhelming surge forward,
The bottom line is celebrating the New Year with joy.
Here they are busy preparing programs,
There they are cleaning the yard and tidying up.
Here the gongs and drums are sounding,
There comes the leaping forward mountain song.
Look how happy everyone's faces are,
Each one is beaming with energy.
The young women are dressed in colorful clothes, so neat and tidy,
The children are wearing bright red headbands,
The old man is puffing his pipe with more enthusiasm,
The old lady is visiting neighbors with her grandson.
On the road, people are collecting manure in small groups,
In the fields, everywhere is the army of fertilizer accumulation,
You use smoked fertilizer, he uses composted fertilizer, each showing their skills,
Making compost and planting green manure, everyone is earnest.
All for the sake of ensuring increased production this year,
Men and women are working hard, preparing for spring plowing.
It is truly a good scene everywhere,
The motherland's rivers and mountains are getting newer year by year.
If you ask why everyone is so happy?
It's all because last year's construction achievements were so amazing,
Our country is becoming stronger and stronger,
The people's lives are rising day by day.
The Party calls for liberating thought and breaking superstitions,
Like a ray of sunshine illuminating everyone's eyes,
Everyone strives to be upstream, more, faster, better, and more economically,
Hard work, practical work, and skillful work are kept in mind.
You chase me, I chase him, everyone is working hard,
Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and never lag behind.
Inventions and creations are like bamboo shoots after a rain,
Heroes and models are countless,
Local experts each have their own skills,
Finding tricks to improve production.
The three major "marshals" rise in their tents, majestic and awe-inspiring,
All walks of life are closely following, galloping like ten thousand horses.
Completed the steelmaking task of 10.7 million tons,
Produced 750 billion catties of grain,
Whether it's industrial products or agricultural products,
One by one, the output is rising.
The harvest of production is hard to express completely,
Establishing people's communes is an even bigger thing.
Everyone praises the commune for having ten major advantages,
Five-in-one of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military.
Guaranteeing increased production,
Advancing industry and agriculture in parallel.
The public canteen is very good,
Everyone is satisfied with eating their fill and eating well.
The nurseries are set up, and women are happy,
Engaging in production without worries greatly increases enthusiasm.
Good news is also constantly coming from the cultural and educational front,
It is truly a hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending.
Labor and education are closely combined,
Both red and expert produce new people.
Literature and art are truly flourishing,
Countless good poems and good paintings.
Thousands of folk songs sing of the Great Leap Forward,
Praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's wise leadership.
…This year's Spring Festival is doubly joyous,
No wonder men and women, old and young, are especially happy.
Everyone remembers to boost their energy during the festival,
After the New Year, compete on the Leap Forward stage!
This is exactly: Hard work gains a good harvest,
The motherland's face is new every day,
Not arrogant or impetuous, continue to leap forward,
Next year's Spring Festival will be even more joyous. (Attached picture)

    处处歌声处处笑（金钱板）
    易和元
    春节到来气象新，
    家家户户笑盈盈，
    不分乡村和城镇，
    到处一片欢乐声。
    大红对联贴得正，
    黑黑的大字亮晶晶，
    上联是排山倒海争跃进，
    下联是欢天喜地过新春。
    这里在准备节目忙得很，
    那里在打扫院子搞卫生。
    这里锣鼓咚咚响一阵，
    那里又传来跃进山歌一声声。
    你看大家脸上多高兴，
    一个个眉开眼笑有精神。
    大姑娘穿红着绿好齐整，
    小娃儿扎上鲜艳红头绳，
    老大爷嘴衔烟杆越叭越有劲，
    老大娘带着孙子在串门。
    大路上人们三三两两在拾粪，
    田野里到处是积肥大军，
    你熏肥他沤肥各显本领，
    造堆肥植绿肥人人认真。
    为的是今年增产有保证，
    男男女女不松劲准备春耕。
    真个是到处一片好光景，
    祖国山河一年更比一年新。
    若要问大家为啥这么高兴？
    皆因是去年建设成绩太惊人，
    我们的国家越变越强盛，
    人民的生活天天往上升。
    党号召解放思想破除迷信，
    像一道霞光照亮了众人眼睛，
    人人力争上游多快好省，
    苦干实干巧干记在心。
    你追我我赶他个个发奋，
    学先进赶先进决不后人。
    创造发明有如那雨后春笋，
    英雄模范数不清，
    土专家个个有本领，
    提高生产找窍门。
    三大“元帅”升帐威风凛凛，
    各行各业紧跟着万马奔腾。
    完成了炼钢任务1070万吨，
    生产了粮食七千五百亿斤，
    不论是工业品和农产品，
    一桩桩一件件产量高升。
    生产的丰收难表尽，
    建立人民公社更是大事情。
    人都夸公社有十大优越性，
    五位一体工农商学兵。
    提高生产有保证，
    工农业并举往前奔。
    公共食堂好得很，
    吃得饱吃得好个个称心。
    托儿所办起来妇女高兴，
    搞生产无牵挂干劲大增。
    文教战线也不断传来喜讯，
    真正是百花齐放百家争鸣。
    劳动与教育结合紧，
    又红又专出新人。
    文学艺术真茂盛，
    好诗好画数不清。
    千万首民歌歌唱大跃进，
    歌颂共产党毛主席领导英明。
    ……今年春节喜庆加喜庆，
    难怪男女老少格外欢欣。
    大家过节不忘鼓干劲，
    过了年跃进台上比输赢！
    这正是：苦战获得好收成，
    祖国面貌日日新，
    不骄不躁再跃进，
    来年春节更欢腾。（附图片）
