(Our dispatch from Guangzhou, January 11) Guangdong Province has comprehensively launched a large-scale spring plowing preparation movement involving water conservancy construction, deep plowing and soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation and application, and sowing and seedling cultivation. The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committees recently implemented work to grasp ideology, inspection, action, and organization, pushing the current spring plowing preparation movement to a climax.

The overall spring plowing preparation work for early rice in Guangdong this year is generally earlier than in previous years. Every morning, the fields present a busy scene. More than four million people are carrying out fine re-plowing and fertilization on deeply plowed land. Of the more than 24 million mu of land that has been deeply plowed, over 18 million mu have been plowed to a depth of about one foot. Among them, some cultivated land has been subjected to layered fertilization, soil improvement, irrigation and drainage system maintenance, field road repair, field manure pool digging, soil fumigation, and treatment of rice roots to eliminate overwintering pests after plowing. Since the launch of the deep plowing and soil improvement movement, the province has accumulated more than 10 billion dan of various fertilizers. In recent days, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation has continued to increase, with an average daily accumulation of more than 300 million dan. Large numbers of migrant workers have been successively dispatched to construction sites to support the water conservancy front. In the Chao-Shan Plain and the Pearl River Delta Plain, the first batch of early rice seeds has been sown one month earlier than in previous years. In many early-sown areas, people are preparing tools for building sheds and adding covers for cold protection and seedling protection while sowing; some of the earliest sown seedlings have now grown to three to five inches in height.

The characteristics of this year's winter plowing preparation work in the province are early production season requirements and high work quality requirements. However, after the previous deep plowing movement, many cadres and the masses had a "good enough" sense of complacency. Local party committees immediately conducted large-scale summaries and commendations, grasping ideology and inspection, and constantly using comparisons between spring plowing quality standards and task completion to educate cadres and encourage the masses to make persistent efforts to carry out comprehensive and large-scale spring plowing preparation. Many counties in the Foshan, Shantou, Shaoguan, and Jiangmen special districts recently conducted large-scale inspections and evaluations of deep plowing and soil improvement or comprehensive spring plowing preparation. They discovered that some cultivated land had not been plowed to a depth of one foot, and many fields had not been fertilized in layers. Cadres and the masses who originally thought that "the fields have been basically plowed and the deep plowing is almost done" saw this situation, and their complacency quickly reversed, setting off a new climax of deep plowing and soil improvement and fertilizer accumulation and application centered on ensuring the quality of spring plowing preparation. Recently, these areas have concentrated a large amount of labor to carry out a concentrated effort to accumulate fertilizer and send fertilizer to the fields, mixing it into the mud and sand to improve the soil. In the Shantou Special District, counties are dispatching more than 600,000 people every day to the mountains and seas to find fertilizer sources and collect farm manure. After conducting a major inspection of water conservancy, fertilizer, seedling land, seeds, tools, and other spring plowing preparation work, various counties on Hainan Island and Jieyang, Chaoan, Chaoyang and other counties immediately organized labor to solve the problems separately.

In the current action of grasping the quality and speed of spring plowing preparation, local party committees generally regard tool reform as the key and vigorously promote the high work efficiency movement. New tool styles, including water conservancy construction, deep plowing and soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, and fertilizer transportation, are emerging one after another. The aerial transportation machines, wooden rail trains, universal wooden harrows, various handcarts and other water conservancy and fertilizer transportation tools that are more widely promoted throughout the province have increased efficiency several times compared with the original. Many water conservancy construction sites in the Jiangmen and Zhanjiang special districts have achieved semi-mechanized construction, eliminating the backward phenomenon of shoulder carrying and manual lifting. Migrant workers who are carrying out intense construction work on various water conservancy construction sites have universally launched a high work efficiency labor competition; in the competition, they are constantly innovating tools and improving construction efficiency.

Guangdong Province's current large-scale spring plowing preparation movement is launched on the basis of implementing a comprehensive arrangement of labor. All localities have generally organized specialized teams for spring plowing preparation production, winter crop field management, sideline occupations, and industry, and have adopted a method of combining assault and normal work to carry out spring plowing preparation. Because arrangements have been made for about 5% of the total labor force to carry out winter sideline production, various communes throughout the province have increased sideline income by more than 200 million yuan in the past month. Other work, such as winter crop field management and commune-run industrial production, has also been normalized due to the establishment of specialized teams. (Attached picture)

### 克服自满思想　全面安排劳力　大搞工具改革  广东提前巧抓备耕工作

    克服自满思想　全面安排劳力　大搞工具改革
    广东提前巧抓备耕工作
    本报广州11日电　广东省已经全面展开了兴修水利、深翻改土、积肥施肥、播种育秧的大备耕运动。中共广东省各级党委最近实行抓思想、抓检查、抓行动、抓组织工作，把当前的备耕运动推向高潮。
    广东省各地今年早造的全面备耕工作普遍比往年提早。每天清早，田野上就呈现出繁忙的景象。四百多万人正在经过深翻的土地上进行精细的返犁、施肥。在已经完成的二千四百多万亩深耕面积中，有一千八百多万亩翻土深度都达到一尺左右。其中，部分耕地在翻土后已进行过分层施肥、改良土壤、整理排灌系统、修整田间道路、挖田头粪池、熏土和处理稻根消灭越冬害虫等项工作。深翻改土运动开展以来，全省已积集了各种肥料一百亿担以上。近几天，各地参加积肥的人数还在陆续增加，平均每天积到的肥料达三亿担以上。大批民工陆续开赴工地，增援水利战线。在潮汕平原和珠江三角洲平原上，最近都比往年提前一个多月时间陆续播下了第一批早稻的种籽。许多早播的地方，人们一面播种一面就准备好搭棚加盖等防寒保苗的工具；有些最早播种的秧苗现已长到三、五寸高了。
    全省今年冬季备耕工作的特点是生产季节要求早、工作质量要求高。但是在经过前段深翻运动后，许多干部和群众曾出现了“差不多”的自满思想。各地党委立刻通过大总结、大表扬，抓思想、抓检查，不断拿备耕质量标准和完成任务情况作对比来教育干部，鼓舞群众，再接再厉的进行全面大备耕。佛山、汕头、韶关、江门等专区许多县最近经过深翻改土或全面备耕大检查、大评比，发现了一部分耕地翻土深度还不到一尺，很多田没有分层施肥，那些原来认为“田已基本翻完，深耕差不多了”的干部和群众见到了这种情况，自满情绪很快便扭转过来，掀起了以保证备耕质量为中心的再次深翻改土和积肥、施肥的高潮。最近，这些地区都已集中了大量劳动力，突击积肥以及送肥下田，入泥入沙，改良土壤。汕头专区各县每天都出动六十多万人上山下海找肥源和收集农家肥。海南岛各县及揭阳、潮安、潮阳等县对水利、肥料、秧地、种子、工具等备耕工作进行大检查以后，发现了问题便立刻组织劳力分头解决。
    各地党委在当前抓备耕质量和速度的行动中，普遍把工具改革作为关键来抓，大搞高工效运动。包括水利施工、深翻改土、积肥、运肥等方面的新工具式样层出不穷。在全省范围内较普遍推广的空中运输机、木轨列车、万能木板耙、各种手推车等水利、积肥运输工具，效率均比原来提高几倍。江门、湛江两个专区许多水利工地都已实现了半机械化施工，消灭了肩挑人抬的落后现象。正在各个水利工地上进行紧张施工的民工们，普遍展开了高工效劳动竞赛；他们在竞赛中不断革新工具，提高施工效率。
    广东省当前的大备耕运动是在实行了全面安排劳动力的基础上展开的。各地普遍组织了备耕生产、冬种作物田间管理、副业和工业的专业队伍，并采取了突击与正常工作相结合的方法进行备耕。由于安排了占劳动力总数5％左右的力量开展冬季副业生产，最近一个多月内全省各个公社已增加了副业收入两亿元以上。其他工作如冬种田间管理及社办工业方面的生产，由于建立了专业队伍后，这些生产也已经走上正常化。（附图片）
