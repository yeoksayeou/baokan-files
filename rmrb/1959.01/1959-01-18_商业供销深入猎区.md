Commercial Supply and Marketing Deepens into Hunting Areas

(Our newspaper, Harbin, January 17) Wherever the hunting teams go, the fur acquisition teams follow – this is an improvement in this winter's wild animal fur acquisition work in Heilongjiang Province. According to incomplete statistics at the end of last year, commercial departments throughout the province had acquired more than 300,000 various furs. The acquisition volume of valuable gray furs was twice that of the same period in the previous year. The commercial departments of Heilongjiang Province have changed the past practice of setting up points at the foot of the mountains and waiting for acquisitions. Since the beginning of winter, they have successively organized large numbers of acquisition personnel to go deep into the hunting grounds, promptly acquiring the hunter's furs and supplying them with sufficient production tools and various means of livelihood. While purchasing and selling, they also provide hunters with technical guidance on skinning, drying, and scraping oil, and jointly study hunting methods with the hunters. This greatly facilitates the hunters and encourages their production enthusiasm. The Oroqen people living in Huma County have sufficient ammunition, no shortage of food or clothing, are full of energy, and are full of drive. In just half a month, the county's forty-four hunting teams have acquired more than 1,000 wild animal furs. (Ji Jingru)

    商业供销深入猎区
    本报哈尔滨17日电　狩猎队深入到那里，皮张收购小组就跟到那里，这是黑龙江省今冬野生动物毛皮收购工作的一项改进。截至去年底的不完全统计，商业部门在全省已收购各种毛皮三十余万张。贵重的灰皮收购量等于前一年同期的两倍。黑龙江省商业部门改变了往年那种山下设点、坐候收购的做法。入冬以来，他们先后组织大批收购人员深入到围场，及时收购猎民的皮张，供应他们以充足的生产工具和各种生活资料。在购销的同时，还对猎民进行剥皮、凉晒、刮油等技术指导，与猎民共同研究狩猎方法。这就大大便利了猎民，鼓舞了他们的生产积极性。居住在呼玛县的鄂伦春族弹药充足，不缺吃，不缺穿，精神饱满，干劲十足。在短短的半月时间内全县四十四个狩猎队就获取野生动物皮张一千余张。　（纪静如）
