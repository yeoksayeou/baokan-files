(Reported by our Guangzhou correspondent on the 29th) Among the 100 larger water conservancy projects in Zhanjiang Prefecture, Guangdong Province, 40 have eliminated manual carrying during construction, with an average of at least one semi-mechanized construction tool for every two people. Over 70% of earthwork, including soil extraction, loading, transportation, and unloading, has been semi-mechanized. Since last autumn, the prefecture has vigorously promoted tool reform in water conservancy construction, popularizing 36 kinds of advanced tools, such as automatic soil-loading ox-drawn plank rakes, automatic soil-loading docks, chute soil transporters, automatic soil-unloading ox carts, automatic soil-unloading handcarts, and wooden rail trains. Among them, over 17,000 automatic soil-loading ox-drawn plank rakes, which are over 50 times more efficient than manual carrying, have been promoted, along with over 84,000 various vehicles. In this way, they have used indigenous methods to semi-mechanize most of the work on nearly half of the water conservancy construction sites, greatly reducing labor intensity and increasing efficiency by several or even dozens of times. The average earthwork efficiency in the entire area has increased from 1.7 cubic meters per person-day in the winter of 1957 to 7 cubic meters. On December 14th last year, 90,000 people working on earthwork in the prefecture completed 1 million cubic meters, averaging over 11 cubic meters per person. During the week of December 14th to 21st, the efficiency of 28 construction sites remained above 20 cubic meters. Ten out of fifteen construction sites in Leinan County have consistently maintained over 20 cubic meters since last winter and this spring.

The significant saving of labor on water conservancy construction sites is the most notable achievement of the tool reform movement. In the winter of 1957, the labor force投入 into water conservancy construction sites reached 1.6 million (including the former Hepu Prefecture, now merged into the two prefectures), almost half of the agricultural labor force. The earthwork tasks last winter and this spring were the same as the previous year, both 240 million cubic meters, but the labor force deployed was only 360,000 (also including the former Hepu Prefecture), equivalent to one-fifth of the previous year. A medium-sized reservoir construction site with about 1 million cubic meters of earthwork used to require the mobilization of tens of thousands of people, but now it requires only one or two thousand at most, and as few as four or five hundred in some cases. The masses said, "In previous years, there were many people and hands on the construction site; this year, there are many cattle and vehicles on the construction site."

As early as last autumn, the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China had already anticipated the tight labor situation for water conservancy construction this year. Therefore, it decided to guide the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction towards tool reform and high-efficiency movement, with everyone acting as a skilled craftsman, everyone offering suggestions, and increasing the average earthwork efficiency to 26 cubic meters. To achieve this goal, the Party committees at all levels applied the experience of leading grain production to water conservancy work, creating experience through experimental plots at each level, and then promoting it through on-site meetings. Cadres at the Huangsha Reservoir in Dianbai County established 33 experimental plots. Chen Rongdian, Secretary of the Dianbai County Committee of the Communist Party of China, created a record of 440 cubic meters per person-day on the "Leap Forward Platoon" experimental plot on the construction site, leaving those conservatives who thought "26 cubic meters is boasting" speechless. The successful experience of the experimental plots promoted the vigorous development of the technical innovation movement throughout the Huangsha Reservoir construction site, with average efficiency consistently maintained at over 30 cubic meters. Cadres at the fifteen construction sites in Leinan County, the Youth Canal, and the Wuling Reservoir in Leibei County all worked on experimental plots. The most efficient automatic soil-loading ox-drawn plank rake was created by Li Heda, the leader of the Iron and Steel Company of the Dashuiqiao Canal in Leinan County. The cadre experimental plots have always been a red flag of the technological revolution, constantly improving tools, replacing the old with the new, continuously creating new records, and driving the entire construction site forward.

Among the five links of extraction, loading, transportation, unloading, and compaction, transportation is the key link with the largest workload. All localities first concentrated their efforts to break through this link, and then forced other links to catch up. The use of ox-drawn plank rakes, chutes, automatic soil transporters, and wooden rail trains increased the efficiency of soil transportation by several or even dozens of times. This required the loading and unloading speed to keep up, which led to the emergence of automatic soil-loading docks, automatic soil-unloading ox carts, and automatic soil-unloading handcarts. The increased loading speed required soil extraction to keep up, which led to the emergence of homemade yellow explosives and large-scale blasting soil extraction methods. The application of large-scale blasting soil extraction, in turn, promoted further improvements in loading and transportation efficiency. In this way, from balance to imbalance and back to a new balance and imbalance, each cycle has led the tool reform movement to a higher stage.

Being both proactive and paying attention to quality and practical results is the guiding principle for ensuring that technical reform can form a mass movement. To ensure quality, in addition to everything being tested, each construction site also established a professional tool reform team. The creations of the masses were tested and, if proven to be effective, were then handed over to the professional team for improvement and manufacturing. The professional team was composed of activists and experienced blacksmiths and carpenters. They had higher skills, and the products they made were of better quality. The products of the professional team were taken to the construction site for trial use, the masses were asked for their opinions, and then they were improved and mass-produced.

    湛江专区许多水利工地半机械化
    一人能干五人的活
    本报广州29日电　广东省湛江专区一百宗较大的水利工程中，已有四十宗在施工中消灭了肩挑，平均每两人至少有一件半机械化施工工具；占土方工作量70％以上的取土、装土、运土和卸土已实现了半机械化。这个专区自去年秋后大搞水利施工工具改革以来，共推广了自动装土牛拉木板耙、自动装土码头、滑槽运土机、自动卸土牛车、自动卸土手推车、木轨火车等各种先进工具三十六种。其中工效比肩挑高五十倍以上的自动装土牛拉木板耙推广了一万七千多部，各种车子共八万四千多部。这样，他们就用土办法使将近半数的水利工地的大部分工种，实现了半机械化，大大减轻了劳动强度，并把工效提高了几倍甚至几十倍。全区土方平均工效已从1957年冬的一点七方提高到七方；去年12月14日全区做土方的九万人，一天完成一百万方，平均每人十一方多。14日至21日这一周中，有二十八个工地的工效保持二十方以上。雷南县十五个工地中的十个工地，在去冬今春一直保持着二十方以上。
    水利工地劳动力的大大节省，是工具改革运动最显著的收获。1957年冬，全区投入水利工地的劳动力达一百六十万人（包括原合浦专区，现两专区合并）差不多占农业劳动力的一半。去冬今春的土方任务，同上一年度相同，都是二亿四千万方，但投放的劳动力只有三十六万人（也包括原合浦专区），即相当于前一年度的五分之一。一个一百万左右土方的中等水库工地，过去要调动一万几千人的，现在多者一两千人，少的只有四、五百人。群众说：“往年工地人多手多，今年工地牛多车多。”
    早在去年秋前，中共湛江地委即已估计到今年兴修水利劳动力很紧张，便决定把广大群众兴修水利的积极性引导到工具改革和高工效运动中去，人人当巧匠，人人献计策，把土方平均工效提高到二十六方。为了达到这个目标，各级党委把领导粮食生产的经验运用到水利工作中去，层层搞试验田创造经验，然后通过现场会议推广出去。电白县黄沙水库的干部建立了三十三块试验田。中共电白县委书记陈荣典的试验田“跃进排”在工地上首先创造了每人平均工效四百四十方的纪录，使那些认为“二十六方是放大炮”的保守派瞠目结舌。试验田的成功经验促进了黄沙水库整个工地技术革新运动的蓬勃发展，平均工效一直保持在三十方以上。雷南县十五个工地、青年运河和雷北县武陵水库的干部个个都搞试验田，效率最高的自动装土牛拉木板耙便是雷南县大水桥渠道钢铁连连长李何大创造的。干部试验田一直是技术革命的一面红旗，它不断改进工具，以新代旧，不断地创造新纪录，带动整个工地前进。
    在取、装、运、卸、压五个环节中，运土是工作量最大的关键环节。各地首先集中力量，突破这个环节，然后迫使其它环节跟上去。牛拉木板耙、滑槽、自动运土机和木轨火车的使用，使运土工效提高了几倍甚至几十倍；这就要求装卸速度必须跟上去，于是就出现了自动装土码头、自动卸土牛车和自动卸土手推车等。装土速度提高了，又要求取土跟上去，于是又出现了土制黄色炸药和大爆破取土法等，而大爆破取土法的运用，反过来又促进装土和运土效率的进一步提高。这样，从平衡到不平衡又达到新的平衡和不平衡，每一次循环都使工具改革运动走上更高的阶段。
    既积极又注意质量和实际效果，这是保证技术改革能够形成群众性运动的方针。为了保证质量，除了一切通过试验以外，各工地还建立了工具改革专业队，群众中的创造经过试用，证明效果确实好的，然后交给专业队去改进和制造。专业队由积极分子和有经验的铁工、木工组成，他们技术较高，制出来的东西质量也较好。专业队的产品拿到工地去试用，请群众提意见，然后又加以改进，大量生产。
