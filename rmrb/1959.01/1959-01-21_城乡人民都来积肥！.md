    Urban and Rural People, Let's All Accumulate Fertilizer!
    To strive for an even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, a mass movement of everyone taking action to accumulate and create fertilizer needs to be immediately launched nationwide.
    In rural areas, it is necessary to have fixed professional teams for accumulating and creating fertilizer, and also to organize the vast number of commune members to accumulate fertilizer, so that fertilizer accumulation activities can be carried out extensively, deeply, regularly and persistently.
    In urban areas, can office cadres, students, troops, and residents also contribute to the work of accumulating fertilizer? The answer is definitely yes. Because urban areas have abundant sources of fertilizer, as long as there is corresponding organizational work, urban fertilizer can be fully utilized to support agricultural production.
    Let each of us contribute to this year's agricultural production!

    城乡人民都来积肥！
    为了争取今年农业生产更大丰收，目前，在全国范围内，需要立即掀起一个人人动手大搞积肥造肥的全民运动。
    在农村，要固定专业积肥造肥队伍，也要组织广大社员积肥，才能使积肥活动广泛深入、经常持久地开展起来。
    在城镇，机关干部、学生、部队、居民是不是也可以在积肥工作中出一分力呢？这是肯定的。因为城镇肥源充足，只要有相应的组织工作，城镇的肥料就可以充分地被利用起来，支援农业生产。
    让我们每一个人，都在今年的农业生产上尽一份力量吧！
