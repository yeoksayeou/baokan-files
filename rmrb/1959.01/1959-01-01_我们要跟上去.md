We Must Catch Up
Tang Shuzhen, Resident of Dongcheng District, Beijing

1958 was a year of great leaps forward in our country's industry and agriculture. For me, a housewife, it was also an extraordinary year.

When the Party called on street residents to vigorously engage in production, I knew the Party was right, so I actively participated in this work. At first, we heard that making glass fertilizer would greatly benefit agricultural production. Three catties of glass fertilizer per mu could increase agricultural production by 25% to 30%, and it could also kill insects. I wanted to make glass fertilizer. However, later I heard that only a few countries in the world, such as the Soviet Union, could produce glass fertilizer, and I became a little scared. I thought, I am a housewife with little education. Is it okay for me to engage in this kind of science and chemistry? At this time, the Party put forward the call to liberate thinking, dare to think, and dare to act, which gave me courage, and I decided to do it.

To build a glass fertilizer factory, we needed a furnace and someone who understood a little bit of technology… But at that time, we had nothing, not even a brick. After discussing it, a few of us housewives decided to look for materials everywhere. As a result, we pieced together the materials for building the furnace. We carried water and mixed mud, and in four days, we built two furnaces for smelting glass fertilizer.

To start the furnace, what should we do without raw materials? We housewives collected them everywhere. In a day or two, you brought a basket, she brought a handful, and we collected more than two hundred catties of various broken glass, wine bottles, etc.

When we started refining, we failed three times in a row due to lack of experience, but we were not discouraged. Several of us carefully studied and found the reasons for the failure. On September 25th of last year, the first furnace of glass fertilizer was finally produced by us housewives.

Through this participation in production, my thinking has undergone great changes. I realized that when thinking is liberated, we are not afraid of any difficulties, and housewives can also contribute their strength to building socialism.

1959 is a year of greater leaps forward in all aspects of our country. A few days ago, at the National Women's Congress of Active Builders of Socialism, I learned that agriculture would have a greater leap forward next year. While attending the meeting, I thought, how can we catch up? After returning, I produced while pondering, and put forward some methods to improve production, to improve the tools for crushing and discharging the furnace, and also to increase manpower and expand equipment. Last year, we produced a total of about one thousand catties of glass fertilizer in four months. This year, we must work even harder to produce more glass fertilizer to support the great leap forward in agriculture.

    我们要跟上去
    北京市东城区市民　唐淑贞
    1958年是我们国家工业、农业大跃进的一年，对我这个家庭妇女来说，也是个不平凡的一年。
    党号召街道居民要大搞生产，我知道党的话没错，就积极地参加了这一工作。开始我们听说搞玻璃肥料对农业生产有很大好处，一亩地上三斤玻璃肥料，农业就能增产25％到30％，还能起杀虫作用。我就想搞玻璃肥料。可是，后来听人说，玻璃肥料在世界上也只有苏联等几个国家能生产，我就有些怕了。我想，我是个家庭妇女，文化不高，搞这种科学、化学行吗？这时，党提出解放思想，敢想敢干的号召，给了我胆量，我下决心干。
    建立玻璃肥料厂，要有炉子，要有懂点技术的人……。可是，我们当时两手空空，连一块砖也没有。我们几个家庭妇女一商量，决定到处去找，结果东凑西凑，砌炉的材料齐了。我们就挑水的挑水，和泥的和泥，用四天工夫，两个熔炼玻璃肥料的炉子建起来了。
    要开炉，没有原料怎么办？我们几个家庭妇女就各处搜集，一两天工夫，你一筐她一把，就弄来了各种碎玻璃、酒瓶子等二百来斤。
    开始炼制时，由于没有经验，连续失败了三次，但是我们没有泄气，几个人仔细研究，找出失败的原因。在去年9月25日，第一炉玻璃肥料终于在我们几个家庭妇女手中制造出来了。
    通过这次参加生产，我的思想有了很大变化。我体会到思想解放了，任何困难也不怕，家庭妇女也能够在建设社会主义中贡献自己的力量。
    1959年是我们国家各方面更大跃进的一年。前些日子，我在全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子大会上，知道明年农业有更大的跃进。开着会我就想，我们怎样才能跟上去呢？回来后，我一边生产，一边琢磨，提出了一些提高生产的办法，要改进粉碎和出炉用的工具，还要增加人，扩大设备。去年我们在四个月中共生产出一千来斤玻璃肥料。今年我们更要鼓足干劲，生产更多的玻璃肥料来支援农业大跃进。
