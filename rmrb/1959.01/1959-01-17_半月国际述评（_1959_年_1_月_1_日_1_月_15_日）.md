    Semimonthly International Review
    (January 1, 1959 – January 15, 1959)
    In the first half of the year, the Soviet Union took powerful steps on the road to defending peace, the flames of the struggle for democracy and independence in Latin America and Africa burned even more vigorously, and the embarrassing dilemma of U.S. imperialism was further exposed—all of which demonstrated to the people of the world that the East Wind would continue to prevail over the West Wind in 1959.
      The Soviet Union's Peace Steps
    On January 2, the Soviet Union successfully launched a cosmic rocket; on January 7, the rocket entered its planned orbit around the sun, adding a red planet to the boundless sky. This brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union shook the world, eloquently demonstrating the great power of the socialist system and proving that the socialist system is infinitely superior to capitalism. The cosmic rocket opened up a new era in science and technology, expanded human knowledge of the universe, and greatly increased the possibility of controlling nature for the benefit of mankind. All honest people regard the Soviet cosmic rocket as a symbol of people's happiness.
    The Soviet cosmic rocket is also a symbol of peace. Today, no one can deny that the Soviet Union has reached unparalleled heights in the latest sectors and decisive aspects of modern science and technology, namely in the use of atomic energy, the construction of jet aircraft, and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Even the most stubborn imperialists have to admit that American rocket technology is far behind. As the bulwark of peace, the Soviet Union's mastery of the world's most advanced rocket launch technology is good news for all peace-loving people. Even the British "Reynolds News" believes that "the military basis of Dulles's brink-of-war policy" has collapsed. This has greatly boosted the confidence of people in all countries to defend and strive for peace.
    On January 4, Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan arrived in the United States at the invitation of the Soviet Ambassador to the United States for a vacation and to conduct informal visits with various sectors of American society. During this visit, which has not yet ended, Mikoyan has had extensive contacts with the U.S. authorities and people from all walks of life and has been widely welcomed by the American people. Mikoyan's visit to the United States is of great significance in promoting understanding between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States and easing international tensions. Mikoyan's talks on peaceful coexistence and strengthening trade and cultural exchanges in major American cities have been warmly welcomed by American audiences. A "New York Times" reporter wrote that "there are signs in every city that the First Deputy Premier's visit is having an increasingly profound impact." The British "Daily Herald" believes that "Mr. Mikoyan's visit to the United States is a major success," and another British newspaper, the "Daily Express," directly stated, "Britain is a country that wants trade" and hopes that Mikoyan will visit Britain.
    The Soviet Union's peace efforts are also reflected in another major step taken towards a peaceful resolution of the German question. On January 10, the Soviet government put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany and sent notes to the countries involved in the war against Germany, suggesting that a peace conference be held within two months, attended by representatives of the two Germanies, to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. In its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, the Soviet government also expressed its willingness to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations. The Soviet-proposed draft peace treaty with Germany, on the one hand, guarantees that Germany can peacefully and democratically develop into a unified and independent country, and on the other hand, helps to eliminate the threat of German militarism rising again.
    As everyone knows, since the end of World War II, due to the deliberate intention of the United States and its British and French partners to make Germany a "shock force" for attacking socialist countries in Europe, Germany has been artificially divided for a long time, West Germany has become a breeding ground for the revival of militarism, and West Berlin has been occupied for a long time and turned into a center of the "Cold War." This not only violates the German people's desire for reunification, but also threatens peace in Europe and the world. For more than ten years, in order to peacefully resolve the German question and promote German reunification, the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested discussing and signing a peace treaty with Germany, and has also put forward various measures conducive to easing tensions and promoting closer relations between the two Germanies. However, all these suggestions and measures have been unreasonably rejected by Western countries. In view of the Western countries' repeated unwillingness to reach an agreement on a peaceful resolution of the entire German question, the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a demilitarized free city of West Berlin last November, in order to first ease the tensions in the Berlin area and create conditions for the subsequent resolution of the entire German question. However, the Western countries rejected this proposal again on the pretext that the Berlin issue must be resolved together with the entire German question. Now the Soviet Union has put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany and a proposal to convene a peace conference, while also expressing its willingness to resolve the Berlin issue through negotiations. This effort by the Soviet Union fully demonstrates its sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question and promoting German reunification.
        From Cuba to the Congo
  The flames of national independence movements are burning more fiercely in Latin America and Africa. At the very beginning of 1959, imperialism suffered a new defeat in Latin America. The pro-American Batista dictatorial regime, which had long been riding on the heads of the Cuban people, collapsed, and the rebel forces led by Castro and supported by the Cuban people marched into Havana, the capital of Cuba. Batista, the dictator who had relied on the United States since 1933 and ruled the Cuban people for seventeen years, has always been recognized as a puppet of the Wall Street sugar tycoons. It provided convenient conditions for the plundering of Cuba by American monopoly capital; American monopoly capital also controlled the economic lifeline of Cuba through it. Therefore, the collapse of the pro-American Batista dictatorial regime this time is a great victory for the Cuban people in their struggle for independence and freedom, and another failure of the American policy of enslavement and interference.
    On January 6, the Cuban Provisional Government was officially sworn in in Havana. The interim president is Manuel Urrutia, nominated by Cuban rebel leader Castro.
    The victory of the Cuban people has aroused widespread attention in world opinion. Newspapers in many countries have pointed out that the fact that the Batista dictatorial regime collapsed shows that the national consciousness of Latin America is rising day by day; the era when American colonialists used their hired puppets to control Latin America is gone forever. The victory of Cuba will encourage patriots in other Latin American countries to march towards victory.
    Following the Cuban incident, from the African continent on the other side of the Atlantic, the Belgian Congo, which has always been regarded by colonialists as the only "stable oasis," also heard the roar of anti-colonialism. On January 4, a mass struggle against Belgian colonial rule broke out in Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo. The direct cause of the riot was the unreasonable prohibition by the colonial authorities of a political gathering of the Congolese people demanding independence, and the bloody suppression of mass protest demonstrations. However, the Congolese people's desire to oppose colonial rule and gain complete independence has been long-standing.
    The struggle of the people of the Belgian Congo lasted for several days starting on January 4. In order to suppress the Congolese people's actions against colonial rule, the Belgian colonial authorities dispatched a large number of troops and police for armed suppression. In just over three days, at least one hundred and seventy-five African residents of the Congo were shot dead, and hundreds were injured. The "Abako" association, a Congolese political group advocating the separation of the Congo from Belgium, was ordered to disband, and hundreds of Congolese were arrested. At present, although large-scale mass resistance actions have been suppressed, the Congolese people's will to fight for independence is even more determined.
    Faced with the Congolese people's increasingly high tide of anger against colonial rule, the Belgian government was forced on the 13th to put forward an empty promise to allow the Belgian Congo to become independent in the future. It stated that Belgium intends to make the Congo a "democratic country capable of exercising sovereignty and deciding its own independence." But it did not propose a specific date for the independence of the Congo, nor did it propose any specific steps to help achieve true independence for the Congo. This approach by the Belgian government cannot deceive anyone.
      America's Serious Dilemma
    If the forces of peace and the forces striving for democratic independence have entered the new year with full confidence, then U.S. imperialism is facing 1959 with a very dim mood. This dim mood was fully reflected in U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's "State of the Union Address" to the U.S. Congress on January 9. From this address, people can see the difficult situation the U.S. ruling clique is in today! It is still trying to offer the already failed method of easing the economic crisis by expanding armaments and preparing for war. However, it is afraid that huge military expenditures will deepen the financial crisis, so it can only cut civilian expenditures to maintain a balance of payments. But this will deepen the crisis of production "surplus." It is afraid of the challenge of peaceful economic competition proposed by the socialist camp, and prays that the people of the capitalist world will not believe that Marxism is the gospel of the future.
    Despite this, U.S. imperialists are still trying their best to strengthen their position through the "Cold War." In his State of the Union Address, Eisenhower proposed an unprecedentedly large military budget of $47 billion for peacetime, accounting for 60% of the total budget, in order to continue expanding armaments and preparing for war. The U.S. ruling clique and its propaganda machine also maliciously described the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket as a "threat" to the United States. The "New York Times" absurdly claimed that this achievement of the Soviet Union "emphasizes that the scope of the Cold War is constantly expanding." U.S. House Space Committee Chairman McCormack even alarmingly declared that "now is the time for the United States to wake up to its danger." They took this opportunity to vigorously promote the arms race.
    Regarding Mikoyan's visit, the U.S. government deliberately showed a – in the words of a Japanese Kyodo News reporter – "bitter face," and tried its best to minimize the significance of the visit. However, this attitude aroused widespread dissatisfaction in U.S. and European public opinion. A "New York Times" reporter wrote: "The State Department has once again been embarrassed by the Soviet Union's initiative," "The State Department's impolite behavior... has caused European newspapers to criticize the United States."
    On the German question, Dulles has made it clear that he will adhere to the basic policy of the West and has no intention of accepting the latest Soviet proposals. This attitude of lacking sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question will certainly not help improve the difficult position the United States is currently in. On the contrary, it will further arouse the opposition of people from all countries who are concerned about European peace and make the United States' position even more isolated.
    The situation in the past half month shows that the days of U.S. imperialism are getting more and more difficult. Even Dulles had to admit in his testimony to the Senate that it is increasingly difficult to change this situation.

    半月国际述评
    （1959年1月1日——1月15日）
    岁首半月，苏联在保卫和平的道路上跨出了有力的步伐，拉丁美洲和非洲争取民主、独立的烽火更旺盛地燃烧起来，美帝国主义的进退两难的狼狈相进一步地暴露——这一切都向全世界人民展示了1959年东风将继续压倒西风的前景。
      苏联的和平步伐
    1月2日，苏联发射宇宙火箭成功，1月7日，火箭进入预定的围绕太阳运行的轨道，无垠天际增添了一颗红色行星。苏联这一辉煌成就震动了全世界，雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的伟大力量，证明了社会主义制度比资本主义无比优越。宇宙火箭开辟了科学技术的新纪元，扩大了人类对宇宙的知识，大大增长了控制自然为人类造福的可能性。所有正直的人们都认为苏联宇宙火箭是人民幸福的象征。
    苏联宇宙火箭又是和平的象征。今天，没有人能否认苏联在现代科学技术最新部门和具有决定性的方面，即在利用原子能、建造喷气式飞机和洲际弹道火箭方面，已经达到无与伦比的高峰，即使是最顽固的帝国主义分子，也不得不承认美国的火箭技术大大落后了。作为和平堡垒的苏联掌握了世界上最先进的火箭发射技术，这是一切爱好和平人民的福音，甚至连英国“雷诺新闻”也认为：“杜勒斯所坚持的战争边缘政策的军事基础”已经崩溃了。这就大大地鼓舞了各国人民保卫和争取和平的信心。
    苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬1月4日应苏联驻美大使的邀请抵美度假，对美国各界人士进行非正式的访问。在这一迄今尚未结束的访问中，米高扬同美国当局和美国各阶层人士进行了广泛的接触，受到了美国人民的普遍欢迎。米高扬的访美，对促进苏美两国人民的了解、缓和国际紧张局势有着重大的意义。米高扬在美国各大城市关于和平共处和加强贸易、文化交流的谈话，受到了美国听众的热诚欢迎。“纽约时报”记者报道说：“每一个城市都有迹象表明这位第一副总理的访问产生越来越深刻的影响”。英国“每日先驱报”认为“米高扬先生访美之行是一个重大的成功”，另一家英国报纸“每日快报”直接提出
  “英国就是要贸易的国家”，希望米高扬访问英国。
    苏联的和平努力还表现在对和平解决德国问题又采取了一项重大步骤。1月10日，苏联政府提出了对德和约草案，并且向参加对德战争的有关国家发出照会，建议在两个月内召开有两个德国的代表参加的和会来讨论和签订对德和约。苏联政府在给美英法政府的照会中还表示愿意通过谈判解决柏林问题。苏联提出的对德和约草案一方面保证了德国可以和平地和民主地发展成为一个统一的独立国家，另一方面也有助于消除德国军国主义再起的威胁。
    大家知道，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，由于美国和它的英法伙伴蓄意要使德国重新成为在欧洲进攻社会主义国家的“突击力量”，德国被人为地长期分裂，西德成为复活军国主义的温床，西柏林也被长期霸占而变为“冷战”的中心。这不仅违反了德国人民要求统一的愿望，也威胁着欧洲和世界和平。十多年来，苏联政府为了和平解决德国问题和促进德国统一，曾经一再建议讨论和签订对德和约，也曾经先后提出各种有利于消除紧张局势和促进两个德国接近的措施。然而所有这些建议和措施都被西方国家无理拒绝。鉴于西方国家一再无意在和平解决整个德国问题上达成协议，苏联在去年11月提出了建立西柏林非军事化自由城市的建议，以便首先缓和柏林地区的紧张局势，为随后的解决整个德国问题创造条件。但是，西方国家又以柏林问题必须同整个德国问题一道解决为借口而拒绝这一建议。现在苏联又提出了对德和约草案和召开和会的建议，同时还表示愿意通过谈判来解决柏林问题。苏联的这种努力，充分证明了它对和平解决德国问题和促进德国统一的诚意。
        从古巴到刚果
  民族独立运动的烽火，在拉丁美洲和非洲更加猛烈地燃烧起来。1959年刚一开始，帝国主义就在拉丁美洲遭到了一个新的失败。长期骑在古巴人民头上的巴蒂斯塔亲美独裁政权宣告垮台，由卡斯特罗领导的、得到古巴人民支持的起义部队开进了古巴首都哈瓦那。巴蒂斯塔，这个从1933年起就投靠美国、统治古巴人民前后达十七年的独裁者，一直被公认为美国华尔街糖业大王的傀儡。它为美国垄断资本掠夺古巴提供了便利条件；美国垄断资本也正通过它控制了古巴的经济命脉。因此，这次巴蒂斯塔亲美独裁政权的垮台，是古巴人民争取独立和自由的斗争的一个大胜利，是美国奴役和干涉政策的又一次失败。
    1月6日，古巴临时政府已在哈瓦那正式宣誓就职。临时总统是由古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗提名的曼努埃尔·乌鲁蒂亚。
    古巴人民的胜利已引起世界舆论的广泛重视，许多国家的报纸指出，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权垮台的事实表明：拉丁美洲民族觉悟日益高涨；美国殖民主义者用它所雇佣的傀儡来控制拉丁美洲的时代已经一去不复返了。古巴的胜利将鼓舞拉丁美洲其他国家的爱国者走向胜利。
    紧接着古巴事件的发生，从大西洋另一边的非洲大陆上，一向被殖民者看成是唯一一块“安定的绿洲”——比属刚果，也传来了反殖民主义的怒吼。1月4日，比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔市爆发了反抗比利时殖民统治的群众性斗争。暴动的直接起因是由于刚果人民要求独立的政治性集会遭到殖民当局的无理禁止，群众举行抗议性示威游行又遭到血腥镇压。但刚果人民反对殖民统治、要求取得完全独立的愿望是由来已久的了。
    比属刚果人民的斗争，从1月4日开始一连持续了好几天。比利时殖民当局为了镇压刚果人民反抗殖民统治的行动，调遣了大批军警进行武装弹压，仅仅三天多，刚果的非洲居民被枪杀的已至少有一百七十五人，被打伤的达数百人。主张刚果脱离比利时而独立的刚果政治团体“阿巴科”协会被勒令解散，几百名刚果人遭到逮捕。目前，大规模的群众性反抗行动虽然被镇压下去，但是，刚果人民争取独立的斗争意志却更加坚决了。
    比利时政府慑于刚果人民日益高涨的反对殖民统治的怒潮，13日被迫提出了一项将来让比属刚果独立的空泛诺言。它声明说，比利时打算让刚果成为一个“能够行使主权和决定自己独立的民主国家”。但是它既没有提出让刚果独立的具体日期，也没有提出任何有助于实现刚果真正独立的具体步骤。比利时政府的这种手法是骗不了人的。
      美国的严重困境
    如果说和平力量、争取民主独立的力量是满怀信心地进入了新的一年，那么，美帝国主义却是以十分暗淡的心情面对着1959年的。这种暗淡的心情在美国总统艾森豪威尔1月9日向美国国会提出的“国情咨文”中得到了充分的反映。人们从这篇咨文中，可以看出来美国统治集团今天是处于何等困难的境地！它仍然企图端出早已失灵了的用扩军备战来缓和经济危机的办法。然而它又害怕巨额的军费开支会加深财政危机，于是只能削减民用开支来维持收支平衡。但是这样又会加深生产“过剩”危机。它害怕社会主义阵营所提出的和平经济竞赛的挑战，祈求资本主义世界的人民不要相信马克思主义是未来的福音。
    尽管如此，美帝国主义者仍然竭力企图通过“冷战”来加强它的地位。艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中提出了达四百七十亿美元的空前庞大的和平时期的军事预算，占预算总额的60％，以继续进行扩军备战。美国统治集团和它的宣传机器还恶意地把苏联发射宇宙火箭说成是对美国的“威胁”。“纽约时报”荒谬地宣称苏联的这一成就“强调说明冷战范围正在不断扩大”。美国众议院空间委员会主席麦考马克更是危言耸听地扬言“现在是美国醒悟到它的危险的时候了”。他们借这个机会大事鼓吹军备竞赛。
    对于米高扬的访问，美国政府故意露出一副——用日本共同社记者的话来说——“苦涩的脸孔”，竭力企图缩小这一访问的意义，然而这种态度引起了美国以及欧洲舆论的广泛不满。“纽约时报”记者写道：“（美国）国务院又一次由于苏联的主动而陷于狼狈的境地”，
  “国务院的不礼貌的行为……使欧洲的报纸纷纷批评美国”。
    在德国问题上，杜勒斯已明白表示要坚持西方的基本政策，无意接受苏联的最新建议。这种毫无诚意和平解决德国问题的态度，当然无助于改善美国目前所处的困难地位，相反的，只会更加引起关心欧洲和平的各国人民的反对，使美国的地位更加孤立。
    这半月来的情况说明，美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过，甚至连杜勒斯在向参院的作证中，也不得不承认，要改变这种局势是日益困难了。
