Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch from Taipei: An unprecedented rat infestation has recently occurred on Taiwan's Green Island (Huo Shao Dao). Taiwanese newspapers report that "American improved breed rats are rampant, disturbing the peace of the entire Green Island township. Strangely, these American improved breed wild rats can smoke and bite cigarettes, making people sigh that there are particularly many strange things this year."

The report says that according to a report from the Green Island Township Farm to the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taiwan Provincial "Department of Agriculture and Forestry," these American improved breed wild rats breed rapidly, with larger ones resembling cats, and generally weighing over two Taiwan jin each (one Taiwan jin equals 0.6 kilograms). Recently, they have been rampaging in the island's fields and residences, causing unprecedented damage to crops, furniture, and clothing. Grain crops and other agricultural crops have suffered more than 50% damage, a very serious situation. Therefore, the township farm requested the "Department of Agriculture and Forestry" to allocate rat poison to the island's farms and residents "to facilitate prevention and control, maintain production, and safeguard the lives of the township residents."

The report says that Jin Yang-hao, head of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taiwan Provincial "Department of Agriculture and Forestry," ignored the serious American rat infestation on Green Island and instead issued a reply stating, "Due to limited funds, no subsidies can be allocated," refusing to allocate rat poison.

How did these American improved breed wild rats, which were originally absent in Taiwan, multiply on Green Island? Taiwanese newspapers, which are subject to strict inspection and news censorship by the Chiang Kai-shek group, did not reveal the truth, only vaguely stating that they were brought by American ships. This matter has aroused questions among people in Taiwan. According to past reports in Taiwanese newspapers, the Chiang Kai-shek group has concentration camps on Green Island. In addition, "bacterial experts" from the "U.S. Naval Medical Research Center" located in Taipei City often visit Orchid Island (Lanyu) and Green Island. The main task of this U.S. military research center is to conduct so-called "research on tropical and subtropical germs and parasitic diseases in the Far East" and "research on the physiological state of animals and insects that spread germs."

    美国老鼠贻祸台湾
    繁殖迅速　横行无忌　害苦居民
    新华社30日讯　台北消息：台湾火烧岛最近发生空前的鼠害。台湾报纸说，岛上的“美国改良种老鼠横行猖獗，使得整个绿岛乡（即火烧岛）鸡犬不宁，更奇怪的是这种美国改良种野鼠会抽、咬香烟，使人闻之不禁同声叹为今年怪事特别多”。
    消息说，据绿岛乡农场向蒋介石集团台湾省“农林厅”报告，这些美国改良种野鼠繁殖迅速，大者如猫，一般每只都重二台斤（一台斤等于○点六公斤）以上，近来在岛上田园住宅里横行，使农作物和家具衣物受到空前祸害，其中粮食作物和其它农作物受损毁50％以上，情形极为严重。因此这个乡农场请求“农林厅”拨灭鼠药给岛上农场和居民，“以利防治，以维生产，维护乡民生活”。
    消息说，蒋介石集团台湾省“农林厅”厅长金阳镐对火烧岛上严重的美国鼠患置之不理，竟作了“经费所限未能拨补”的批复，拒绝拨发灭鼠药。
    这种台湾原来没有的美国改良种野鼠怎么会在火烧岛上繁殖起来，受到蒋介石集团严格检查和新闻封锁的台湾报纸没有透露真相，只笼统说是由美国轮船带来的。这事在台湾已引起人们的疑问。根据台湾报纸过去透露的消息，蒋介石集团在火烧岛上设有集中营。另外，设在台北市的“美国海军医学研究中心”的“细菌专家”，也常常到兰屿、火烧岛等地活动。这个美军研究中心的主要任务是进行所谓“研究远东热带和亚热带的病菌和寄生虫病”，以及“研究传播病菌的动物、昆虫的生理状态。”
