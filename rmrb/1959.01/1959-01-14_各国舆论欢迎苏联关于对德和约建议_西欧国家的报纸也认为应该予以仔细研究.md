Xinhua News Agency Report: The Soviet Union's new proposals regarding a German peace treaty have been widely welcomed and valued by international public opinion.

The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Rude Pravo" published an editorial stating that the Soviet proposal to conclude a German peace treaty is another more meaningful measure, following the proposal to normalize the Berlin situation, to eliminate a dangerous source of war and is a great contribution to consolidating European peace.

The Polish newspaper "Trybuna Ludu" commented that the conclusion of a German peace treaty could promote the German people's resolution of the main national issue - the unification of the country.

The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial stating that the Bulgarian people sincerely support the Soviet proposal. This Soviet proposal profoundly reflects the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. The newspaper went on to write that the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the normalization of the Berlin situation would be a major contribution to ensuring the safety of the European people and consolidating the cause of world peace.

The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" commented that the Soviet government's proposal, like its previous initiative to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, is another sincere effort by the Soviet Union to promote a peaceful resolution of the German problem and safeguard European peace.

Western European newspapers have commented on the Soviet proposals for a German peace treaty.

Although London newspapers hold different attitudes towards the Soviet proposals, most commentators pointed out that these proposals must be studied very carefully and that hasty, ill-considered responses should be avoided. The influential London "Times" emphasized that "the Soviet viewpoint should be carefully studied."

The French big bourgeoisie newspapers believe that the Soviet proposals are "unacceptable" to the West. For example, "Les Echos" wrote, "If the Allies agree to the Soviet proposals, they would have to violate all the past policies they reaffirmed at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in December (last year)." However, this newspaper acknowledged that the motive behind the Soviet initiative is to resolve the German issue and ease tensions in Europe.

"Combat" commentator Anderson believes that the Soviet proposals "reflect the undeniable desire to negotiate in an atmosphere of better mutual understanding and to ease international tensions." He pointed out that if the West refuses to negotiate, it will not only permanently lose the initiative in Central Europe, but also show itself unwilling to sincerely strive to ease tensions in the face of international "neutral" public opinion.

    各国舆论欢迎苏联关于对德和约建议
    西欧国家的报纸也认为应该予以仔细研究
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联关于对德和约的新建议，受到各国舆论的广泛欢迎和重视。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表社论说，苏联提出的缔结对德和约的建议，是继使柏林局势正常化的建议之后的又一个消除危险的战争策源地的更有意义的措施，是对巩固欧洲和平的一个伟大贡献。
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表评论说，缔结对德和约，能够促进德国人民解决主要的全民族问题——国家的统一。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”发表社论说，保加利亚人民衷心支持苏联的建议。苏联这一建议深刻地反映了苏联的和平政策。报纸接着写道，缔结对德和约和柏林局势正常化，将是对保证欧洲人民安全和巩固世界和平事业的一大贡献。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表评论说，苏联政府的这个建议，同它在这以前提出的关于把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的倡议一样，是苏联再次为促进德国问题的和平解决和维护欧洲和平而进行的真挚的努力。
    西欧各国报纸纷纷评论苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议。
    尽管伦敦各报对苏联的建议所抱的态度各不相同，但是大多数评论员都指出，必需非常仔细地来研究这些建议，而不要仓促地作出不经深思熟虑的回答。有影响的伦敦“泰晤士报”着重指出，“应该仔细研究苏联的观点”。
    法国大资产阶级的报纸认为苏联的建议是西方所“不能接受的”。例如：“回声报”写道，“盟国如果同意苏联的建议，那就得违背它们（去年）12月间在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上所重申的过去的全部政策。”但是，这家报纸承认，苏联倡议的动机是要解决德国问题和缓和欧洲紧张局势。
    “战斗报”评论员安德森认为，苏联的建议“反映了要求在更好地互相谅解的气氛中进行谈判并缓和国际紧张局势的无可置疑的愿望”。他指出，如果西方拒绝谈判，那就不仅会在中欧地区永远失去主动，并且会在国际“中立”舆论面前表明自己不愿真诚争取缓和紧张局势。
