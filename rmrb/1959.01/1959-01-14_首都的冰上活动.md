Ice activities in the Capital

    The severe cold this winter arrived late. The ice rinks in the capital did not open until after January 8th, more than half a month later than last winter. As soon as the ice rinks opened, ice skating enthusiasts flocked to them in groups to show off their skills. Large ice rinks such as Shichahai, Beihai, Taoranting, Zhongshan Park, and the Cultural Palace receive hundreds or thousands of people every day. Especially on Sundays, the rinks are almost always full. The Shichahai skating rink, with an area of 22,000 square meters, is particularly lively. There are two ice hockey rinks, a 400-meter speed skating track, and areas for figure skating or beginners. Because of its large size and relatively complete facilities, it receives more people than other ice rinks every day. On January 11th alone, it received more than three thousand skating enthusiasts.

    In the city and suburbs, many schools, factories, and organizations have created their own small, simple ice rinks. Because the venues are close and convenient for activities, more people can participate in ice activities. (Photos attached)

    首都的冰上活动
    今冬严寒姗姗来迟。首都各滑冰场迟至1月8日以后才陆续开放，比去冬晚开放半个多月。冰上爱好者们，当冰场一开放，就成群结队地来到冰场上显示身手。什刹海、北海、陶然亭、中山公园和文化宫等大型冰场，每天都要分别接待几百个或几千个人，特别是星期天几乎场场人满。有二万二千平方公尺面积的什刹海溜冰场更是人形活跃。这里有两个冰球场，有四百公尺速滑跑道，也有溜花样或新学者的活动场所。由于场地大、设备较齐全，每天要比其他冰场接待更多的人，仅1月11日这天，就接待了三千多个溜冰爱好者。
    在市内和郊区，有不少学校、工厂、机关自己泼了小型简单冰场。因为场地近、活动方便，使更多的人参加了冰上活动。（附图片）
