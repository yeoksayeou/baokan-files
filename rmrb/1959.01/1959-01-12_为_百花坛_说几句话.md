    Saying a Few Words for "Baihua Tan"
    The "Baihua Tan" (Garden of a Hundred Flowers) column begins meeting readers today.
    Opening this column of artistic essays is based on the following ideas:
    To make it a new garden on the supplement to implement the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy on literature and art;
    To make it a place for artists and comrades concerned about the arts to discuss various new issues.
    Here, we can have cordial conversations and heated debates. We can talk about personal feelings on a certain issue, and we can also talk about topics of common interest.
    In the socialist art garden of the motherland, a hundred flowers are blooming. We hope this column will help the further prosperity of the arts!

    为“百花坛”说几句话
    “百花坛”这个栏目，今天开始同读者见面。
    开辟这个艺术随笔式的栏目，有着这样的一些设想：
    让它成为在副刊上贯彻党对文学艺术上的百花齐放方针的新的园地；
  让它成为艺术家和关心艺术事业的同志们谈论各种新鲜问题的地方。
    在这里，可以亲切地交谈，可以热烈地辩论。可以谈谈个人对某一问题的感受，也可以谈谈共同感到兴趣的题目。
    在祖国的社会主义艺术园地里，百花正盛开着。我们希望这个栏目有助于艺术事业的更加繁荣！
