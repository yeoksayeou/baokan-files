Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 1st. The workers of Harbin Electric Machinery Plant produced China's first 72,500-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator on the last day of 1958 as a gift to the New Year's Day of 1959. After this hydraulic turbine generator is installed and generates electricity, it can generate 1.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which can be used for lighting in large cities with a population of more than 5 million.

This hydraulic turbine generator, currently the largest domestically produced one, is manufactured for the Xin'an River Hydropower Station in Zhejiang Province, which is under construction. It was originally planned to be trial-produced in 1959, but in order to build the Xin'an River Hydropower Station as soon as possible, the workers of Harbin Electric Machinery Plant started feeding materials on December 1, 1958, ahead of schedule. During the trial production, factory leaders and technicians went deep into the workshops and worked with the workers, and Soviet experts stationed in the factory also provided technical guidance day and night. In addition, the workers of Harbin Insulating Material Factory and Harbin Wire Factory produced dozens of tons of special wires and insulating materials for this generator. Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Harbin No. 1 Tool Plant, and other factories also organized manpower to assist the plant. Therefore, it only took 30 days from the start of feeding materials to the completion of this huge hydraulic turbine generator, shortening the original production cycle by three months.

    愿新安江水电站早放光明
    最大水轮发电机诞生哈尔滨
    新华社哈尔滨1日电　哈尔滨电机厂职工在1958年最后一天生产出了我国第一台七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机，作为向1959年元旦的献礼。这台水轮发电机安装发电后，每天能发出一百六十万度电，可供五百多万人口的大城市照明用。
    这台目前国产最大的水轮发电机，是为正在建设中的浙江省新安江水电站制造的。它原计划在1959年开始试制，但是为了使新安江水电站早日建设起来，哈尔滨电机厂职工提前在1958年12月1日开始投料。试制中，工厂领导干部和技术人员深入车间和工人一起劳动，驻厂的苏联专家也日夜进行技术指导。此外，哈尔滨绝缘材料厂和哈尔滨电线厂职工为这台发电机生产了几十吨特制电线和绝缘材料。哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨第一工具厂等还组织人力到厂协助。因此，这台庞大的水轮发电机从投料到制成只花了三十天时间，比原定生产周期缩短了三个月。
