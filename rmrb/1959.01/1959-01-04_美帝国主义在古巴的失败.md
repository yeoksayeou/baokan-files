    The Failure of U.S. Imperialism in Cuba

    At the beginning of the New Year, a thunderclap came from the distant Caribbean coast: the Batista dictatorial regime, which had long been riding on the heads of the Cuban people, collapsed, and the rebel forces led by Castro, supported by the Cuban people, have entered the Cuban capital, Havana. This is a great victory for the Cuban people's anti-dictatorship struggle and a serious failure for U.S. imperialism, the mastermind behind the Batista regime.
    As everyone knows, Cuba, the "sweetest country in the world," has long been a paradise for American monopoly capital. Cuba ranks thirteenth in area among the twenty-one Latin American countries, but it ranks third in U.S. direct investment in Latin American countries. U.S. investment in Cuba totals more than one billion U.S. dollars, controlling the sugar industry, which is the foundation of the Cuban economy, as well as other Cuban economic sectors such as electricity, transportation, and mining. In the past five years alone, the United States has plundered 750 million U.S. dollars in profits from Cuba. In order to ensure and expand this astonishing plunder of the Cuban people, for decades, the United States has placed one after another scumbag of the Cuban people on the throne of the "President of the Republic of Cuba" to serve the interests of American monopoly capital.
    Batista, who collapsed this time, took refuge in the United States in 1933 and ruled the Cuban people for seventeen years. During these long years, especially since 1952 when he launched an armed coup with the support of the United States and returned to power, the entire Cuba became a fascist prison, and the Cuban people were in dire straits. During Batista's rule, American monopoly capital had its way in Cuba. The Batista regime tried every means to serve American capital. Half of all U.S. investment in Cuba was made during Batista's rule. Batista used the blood and sweat of the Cuban people as the price to obtain the support of U.S. imperialism; and the U.S. government used its full support for the rule of this dictator to achieve its goal of sucking the blood of the Cuban people.
    Batista's tyranny aroused increasingly strong anger and resistance from the Cuban people. Opposing the selling out of national interests and overthrowing the dictatorial rule became the common demands of all classes in Cuba. Therefore, two years ago, the armed struggle led by Castro received widespread support from the Cuban people.
    U.S. imperialism has always been hostile to the national and democratic movement of the Cuban people. When the advantage in the balance of power seemed to be still on Batista's side, the United States openly and fully supported Batista, attempting to extinguish the rebel army. When the balance of power changed and the situation was clearly unfavorable to Batista, the United States changed its strategy, put on a mask of "non-interference," and secretly continued to support Batista's military operations against the rebel forces. Just not long ago, the United States also instructed Batista to fabricate a "general election" in an attempt to reverse the decline. However, all of this could not prevent the collapse of Batista's reactionary regime. Now, the Cuban rebel army has entered the Cuban capital, Havana. Another dictator supported by U.S. imperialism in Latin American countries has collapsed.
    In recent years, the patriotic and democratic forces in Latin America have continued to grow. The dictatorial regimes, which serve as tools for the United States to control Latin American countries, are increasingly rejected by the people. Eight pro-American dictatorial regimes, including Perón of Argentina, Osorio of El Salvador, Odría of Peru, Somoza of Nicaragua, Magloire of Haiti, Rojas of Colombia, Armas of Guatemala, and Jiménez of Venezuela, have been overthrown one after another. Now, the Batista regime, which has always been called a "capable and steadfast friend" by U.S. imperialism, has also announced its collapse. All of this powerfully proves that it is becoming increasingly difficult for U.S. imperialism to continue to maintain pro-American dictatorial governments in Latin American countries.
    The flames of the Latin American people's demands for safeguarding national independence, striving for democratic freedom, and opposing U.S. plunder and interference are burning. The aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism are suffering increasingly serious setbacks. The victory of the Cuban people will greatly encourage and promote the struggle of the Latin American people against U.S. imperialism.

### 美帝国主义在古巴的失败

    美帝国主义在古巴的失败
    新年伊始，从遥远的加勒比海畔传来一声响雷，长期骑在古巴人民头上的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权垮台了，由卡斯特罗领导的、得到古巴人民支持的起义部队已经开进了古巴首都哈瓦那。这是古巴人民反独裁斗争的巨大胜利，也是巴蒂斯塔政权的幕后主子美帝国主义的严重失败。
    大家知道，古巴这个“世界上最甜的国家”，早就成为美国垄断资本的乐园。古巴面积在拉丁美洲二十一国中占第十三位，但是它在美国对拉丁美洲各国的直接投资中却占第三位。美国在古巴的投资总额达十亿美元以上，控制了作为古巴经济基础的糖业，也控制了古巴的其他经济部门如电力、交通运输和采矿等。仅仅在近五年内，美国从古巴劫走的利润就达七亿五千万美元。为了保证并且扩大这种对古巴人民的惊人掠夺，数十年来，美国把一个又一个的古巴人民的败类安放在“古巴共和国总统”的宝座上，为美国垄断资本的利益服务。
    这次垮台的巴蒂斯塔从1933年起就投靠美国，统治古巴人民前后达十七年。在这漫长的岁月中，特别是1952年在美国支持下发动武装政变而重新上台以来，整个古巴成为一座法西斯大监狱，古巴人民处于水深火热之中。而在巴蒂斯塔执政期间，美国垄断资本在古巴却遂心所欲。巴蒂斯塔政权想尽一切办法为美国资本效劳。在美国对古巴的全部投资中，就有一半是在巴蒂斯塔统治期间投入的。巴蒂斯塔以古巴人民的血汗作为代价，来换取美帝国主义的支持；而美国政府则以全力支持这个独裁者的统治来达到它吸吮古巴人民的膏血的目的。
    巴蒂斯塔的暴政，引起了古巴人民日益强烈的愤怒和反抗。反对出卖民族利益，打倒独裁统治，成了古巴各阶层的普遍要求。因此，两年以前，由卡斯特罗所领导的武装斗争，得到了古巴人民的广泛支持。
    美帝国主义一贯仇视古巴人民的民族民主运动。当力量对比的优势看来似乎还在巴蒂斯塔一方的时候，美国公开地、全力地支持巴蒂斯塔，企图扑灭起义军。当力量对比发生变化，形势对巴蒂斯塔显然不利的时候，美国就改变策略，戴上“不干涉”的面具，暗中则继续支持巴蒂斯塔反对起义部队的军事行动。就在不久以前，美国还指使巴蒂斯塔制造“大选”，企图挽回颓势。但是，所有这一切，都无法阻止巴蒂斯塔反动政权的崩溃。现在，古巴起义军已进入古巴首都哈瓦那。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲国家中扶植的又一个独裁者垮台了。
    最近几年来，拉丁美洲爱国民主力量不断壮大。作为美国控制拉丁美洲国家的工具的独裁政权，越来越遭到人民的唾弃。阿根廷的庇隆、萨尔瓦多的奥索里欧、秘鲁的俄德里亚、尼加拉瓜的索摩查、海地的马格鲁阿、哥伦比亚的罗哈斯、危地马拉的阿马斯、委内瑞拉的希门尼斯等八个亲美独裁政权都先后被推翻。现在一向被美帝国主义称为“能干、坚定的朋友”的巴蒂斯塔政权，又宣告垮台了。这一切有力地证明，美帝国主义要在拉丁美洲各国继续保持亲美的独裁政府，已经是越来越困难了。
    拉丁美洲人民要求维护民族独立，争取民主自由，反对美国掠夺和干涉的火焰正在燃烧着。美帝国主义的侵略势力，正在遭到日益严重的挫折。古巴人民的胜利将大大鼓舞和推动拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
