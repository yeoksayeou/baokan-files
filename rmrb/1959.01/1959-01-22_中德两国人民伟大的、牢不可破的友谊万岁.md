Long Live the Great and Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and German People
Zhu Kezhen, President of the Sino-German Friendship Association

Today, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, is visiting our country with the deep friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people are extremely excited about the visit of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to our country.

The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are two socialist countries established in the same year and month, one at the eastern outpost of the socialist camp and the other at the western outpost of the socialist camp. Although the geographical distance between our two countries is so far, we have a common cause, common ideals, a common ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and we live together in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the brotherly and unbreakable friendship between our two countries is becoming more and more consolidated and developed day by day.

In 1951 and 1954, I visited the German Democratic Republic twice. In 1951, I went to the German Democratic Republic to participate in the Sino-German Friendship Month. During this Sino-German Friendship Month, I was deeply moved by the sincere friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic towards our Chinese people. We were warmly and thoughtfully received by German comrades everywhere, and from gray-haired old ladies to innocent and lively children welcomed us as if we were their own relatives. Although eight years have passed since all this, it still appears before my eyes from time to time. In 1954, I visited the German Democratic Republic again, this time with Vice Premier Chen Yi to participate in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. Although there were only two years between the two visits to Germany, the progress in all aspects made me feel happy and encouraged. I personally witnessed the brilliant achievements made by the first worker-peasant regime in German history in this short period. In recent years, especially in 1958, whenever I read reports in the newspaper about the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in various fields, I could not help but think of the selfless labor of the people of the German Democratic Republic for the cause of socialist construction that I saw during my visit to the German Democratic Republic.

The people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the Government of the German Democratic Republic, have made great achievements in all aspects. Taking 1958 as an example, according to preliminary statistics, industrial output increased by 10.7% compared with 1957, and the total investment in 1958 increased by 1.721 billion marks compared with the total investment in 1957. In 1959, the scale of economic construction in the German Democratic Republic will be even more magnificent than in 1958. In 1959, the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 11.1% compared with 1958, the chemical industry will increase by 9.7%, and woolen fabrics will increase by 34.5%. In 1958, the German Democratic Republic held its third general election, which showed that the working people of the German Democratic Republic are fully determined to defend their socialist achievements and fight for the complete victory of socialism. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held in July of the same year was of particularly great significance. This congress not only planned an inspiring prospect for the people of the German Democratic Republic to build a socialist democratic Germany, but also made new contributions to further promoting the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, opposing the imperialist policy of aggression, crushing modern revisionism represented by the leading group of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement.

The German people have made significant contributions to the development of world civilization over the centuries. The eternal scientific truth of Marxism was discovered by Marx and Engels, the great sons of the German people. The German people have contributed to mankind outstanding revolutionary leaders such as Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Ernst Thälmann, excellent writers such as Goethe, Schiller, Heine, and Lessing, outstanding musicians such as Beethoven, Bach, Schubert, and Brahms, and outstanding scientists such as Leibniz and Humboldt. People all over the world are proud of the German people's contribution to mankind. The Chinese and German people have a deep friendship. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic has brought this friendship to a new stage, especially the friendly visit to our country by the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl in December 1955, and the signing of the Treaty of Friendship between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, the Sino-German Cultural Cooperation Agreement, and the Sino-German Agreement on Plant Quarantine and Cooperation in the Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests. This is of great significance for strengthening the comprehensive brotherly friendship and close cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. Over the past three years, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries has become closer, and political mutual support between the two countries has also made important contributions to world peace.

Our revolutionary cause has been helped by the German revolutionary forces, and in our cause of building socialism, the German Democratic Republic and other fraternal countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have given our country significant support. We all know very well that all our successes and victories are inseparable from Marxism-Leninism, from the great October Revolution, and from the help, support, unity, and friendly cooperation of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

Today, we are in an era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, an era where we are getting better and better and the enemy is rotting day by day. The New Year of 1959 brought us an exciting good news. The Soviet Union's cosmic rocket went to the sky. This red solar system planet is playing the triumphant song of socialism in space. This is a sign of the superiority of the socialist system and a powerful proof that the East wind is further prevailing over the West wind. However, US imperialism is not reconciled to its failure. Although it is a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak, it still wants to show its teeth and claws. US imperialism occupies our territory Taiwan, interferes in our internal affairs, continues to create tension in the Taiwan Strait, and continues to engage in the conspiracy of "two Chinas." All these acts of US imperialism will not have any other result than tightening the noose around its neck.

Germany should become a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country, but due to the divisive policies of the United States, Britain, and France, the German people's desire to unify their motherland has not yet been realized. US imperialism deliberately revives the Nazi forces in West Germany to become a commando team for provoking new wars, and deliberately turns West Germany into a breeding ground for new wars. Berlin is also under the military occupation of the United States, Britain, and France, and West Berlin has become a "frontline city" for Western countries to conduct "cold war" and create international tensions, and a malignant tumor that threatens peace. We fully support the statement of our government, support the Soviet Union's proposal on the Berlin issue, and firmly believe that the occupation system in Berlin must be eliminated. On January 10 this year, the Soviet government put forward a draft treaty of peace with Germany, and we fully agree with this draft treaty. We are convinced that the German people's desire to unify their motherland must and will be realized.

The proletarian internationalist unity and cooperation between our socialist countries cannot be destroyed by any force. We believe that the relationship of mutual assistance, cooperation, love, and internationalist friendly unity between our country and the German Democratic Republic, and between all socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Today, in the first month of the tenth anniversary of the founding of both our countries, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl has come to our country for a friendly visit. We firmly believe that through this friendly visit, the friendly cooperation between our two countries will be further strengthened. As we warmly welcome the distinguished guests of the German Democratic Republic with excitement today, let us raise our arms and shout:

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people!
Long live the great unity and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    中德两国人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊万岁
    中德友好协会会长　竺可桢
    今天，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团带着德意志民主共和国人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，前来我国进行友好访问。中国人民对德意志民主共和国政府代表团对我国的访问，感到极大的兴奋。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是同年同月建立的两个社会主义国家，一个处在社会主义阵营的东方前哨，另一个处在社会主义阵营的西方前哨。虽然在地理上我们两国之间的距离是那么遥远，但是我们有着共同的事业、共同的理想、共同的马克思列宁主义的思想基础，并且共同地生活在以苏联为首的社会主义的大家庭里，因而我们两国之间兄弟般、牢不可破的友谊一天比一天巩固和发展。
    在1951年和1954年，我曾两度到过德意志民主共和国。1951年我是到德意志民主共和国去参加德中友好月的。在这次德中友好月中，我深深地为德意志民主共和国的人民对我们中国人民的那种真挚的友情所感动。我们到处受到德国同志的殷勤和周到的接待，从白发龙锺的老太太到天真活泼的小朋友都像对待自己亲人那样欢迎着我们。这一切虽然在时间上已经过去了八年，可是还不时的出现在我的眼前。1954年我再度访问了德意志民主共和国，这次我是随着陈毅副总理去参加德意志民主共和国的五周年国庆典礼去的。虽然两次访问德国在时间上相隔只有两年光景，可是各方面的进步使我感到欢欣鼓舞。我亲眼看到了这个德国历史上第一个工农政权在这短短的期间内所取得的辉煌成就。最近几年里，特别是在1958年，每当我在报上读到有关德意志民主共和国在各方面取得了伟大成就的报道时，我就情不自禁地想起我在德意志民主共和国访问时所看到的德意志民主共和国人民为社会主义建设事业所进行的那种忘我的劳动。
    德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在各方面都取得了伟大的成就。就以1958年来说，据初步统计，工业产量比1957年增加了10.7％，1958年的投资总额比1957年的投资总额增加了十七亿二千一百万马克。1959年德意志民主共和国的经济建设规模将比1958年更为宏伟。在1959年，民主德国的工业产量将比1958年增加11.1％，化学工业增加9.7％，毛织品将增加34.5％。1958年内，德意志民主共和国举行了第三次大选，这次选举表明了德意志民主共和国劳动人民有充分决心，要保卫自己的社会主义成果，为社会主义的完全胜利而斗争。同年7月召开的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会是具有特别重大的意义的，这次大会不仅为德意志民主共和国人民规划了建设社会主义民主德国的振奋人心的前景，而且对于进一步促进德国在和平民主基础上统一，反对帝国主义的侵略政策，对于粉碎以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，也作出了新的贡献。
    德国人民在几个世纪中曾对世界文明的发展作出了重大的贡献。永恒的科学的真理马克思主义就是德国人民伟大的儿子马克思、恩格斯所发现的。德国人民向人类贡献过像卡尔·李卜克内西、罗莎·卢森堡、恩斯特·台尔曼那样杰出的革命领袖，像歌德、席勒、海涅、莱辛那样优秀的文学家，像贝多芬、巴哈、舒伯特、勃兰姆斯那样卓越的音乐家，像莱白尼兹、亨波尔脱那样杰出的科学家。全世界人民都为德国人民对人类的贡献而感到骄傲。中国人民和德国人民，有着深厚的友谊。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的成立，使这种友谊进入到一个新的阶段，特别是1955年12月以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团来我国作友好访问，签订了中华人民共和国德意志民主共和国友好条约、中德文化合作协定和中德关于植物检疫和防治农作物病虫害合作协定。这对加强中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的全面兄弟友谊和亲密合作方面有着重大的意义。三年以来，两国之间经济上、文化上的合作更加紧密了，两国之间的政治上的相互支持，对世界和平也作出了重要的贡献。
    我国革命事业，曾经得到了德意志革命力量的帮助，在我们建设社会主义的事业中，德意志民主共和国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家又给予我国重大支援。我们都十分清楚的知道，我国的一切成功和胜利都是和马克思列宁主义分不开的，都是和伟大的十月革命分不开的，都是和苏联以及其他兄弟国家的帮助、支援、团结和友好合作分不开的。
    今天，我们是处在东风压倒西风的时代，是处在我们一天天好起来、敌人一天天烂下去的时代。1959年的新年给我们带来了一个令人振奋的喜讯。苏联的宇宙火箭上了天。这个红色的太阳系行星正在太空中高奏着社会主义的凯歌，这是社会主义制度优越性的标志，这是东风进一步压倒西风的有力明证。但是美帝国主义是不甘心于它的失败。尽管它是外强中干的纸老虎，但它总还要张牙舞爪。美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾，干涉我国内政，继续在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，继续在搞“两个中国”的阴谋，美帝国主义这一切勾当除了把套在自己脖子上的绞索勒得更紧之外，是不会有任何其它结果的。
    德国应当成为一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的国家，可是由于美国、英国和法国的分裂德国的政策，德国人民统一祖国的心愿还未能得到实现。美帝国主义蓄意把西德纳粹势力复活起来成为挑起新战争的突击队，蓄意把西德变成为新战争的策源地。柏林也在美、英、法的军事占领之下，西柏林已经成为西方国家进行“冷战”制造国际紧张局势的一个“前哨城市”和威胁和平的毒瘤。我们完全拥护我国政府的声明，支持苏联对柏林问题的建议，坚认柏林的占领制度必须消除。今年1月10日苏联政府又提出对德和约的草案，我们完全赞成这个草案，我们确信德国人民统一祖国的愿望一定要实现，一定能实现。
    我们社会主义国家之间的无产阶级国际主义的团结、合作是任何力量所不能破坏的。我们相信在我国与德意志民主共和国之间，在以苏联为首的各社会主义国家之间互助合作，相爱无间和国际主义友好团结的关系，必将继续得到巩固和发展。
  今天，在我们两国都是十周年国庆的第一个月里，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团来到我国作友好访问。我们深信，通过这次友好访问，我们两国的友好合作一定会得到进一步的加强。当我们怀着兴奋的心情热烈的欢迎德意志民主共和国贵宾的今天，让我们振臂高呼：
    中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和巩固万岁！（附图片）
