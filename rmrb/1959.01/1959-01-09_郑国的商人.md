    Reading Notes
    
    The merchants of Zheng were the most active during the Spring and Autumn period. The Zuo Zhuan contains records of them. The most famous is the story of Xian Gao's犒劳 (kàoláo -犒勞) army. When the Qin army launched a surprise attack on Zheng, they passed through the state of Hua. Zheng merchant Xian Gao was on his way to Zhou to do business when he encountered the enemy troops. Xian Gao, in a moment of quick thinking, used twelve oxen to犒劳 the Qin army. The Qin army, thinking that Zheng was prepared, had no choice but to destroy Hua and return (Duke Xi, year 33). Second, when Xun Ying of Jin was captured by Chu, a Zheng merchant planned to smuggle him out of the country hidden among the cotton clothes he was transporting. Everything was ready, but Chu released Xun Ying and sent him back to Jin. Later, when the Zheng merchant went to Jin to do business, Xun Ying was very grateful to him and treated him with great hospitality. The Zheng merchant felt bad about this and went to Qi to do business instead (Duke Cheng, year 3). From these two stories, it appears that Zheng merchants went as far north as Zhou, as far south as Chu, as far west as Jin, and as far east as Qi. Not only did they do business everywhere, but they also seemed to have a grand style. One impersonated his country to comfort the enemy, and another helped a Jin general escape. These are not things that small-time merchants could do.
    
    Furthermore, the profession of merchant seems to have been respected by society. Some people even took it as a name; a Qi nobleman was named Shangren (Merchant) (Duke Wen, year 3). At least their status was above that of the yamen runners (皂隸), as the order of rank was: commoners (庶人), artisans (工), merchants (商), yamen runners, herdsmen (牧), and grooms (圉) (Duke Xiang, year 14). Of course, their position was below that of commoners and artisans; it seems that nobles disdained to engage in this line of work. They played a role in society by facilitating the exchange of goods, so there was the saying, "Those with the same vices seek each other, like traders in the market" (Zhao Gong, year 13, Han Xuanzi's words).
    
    Why were the merchants of Zheng the most active? First, Zheng's geographical location was ideal. Zheng was located between the Ji, Luo, He, and Ying rivers, with its capital in present-day Xinzheng, Henan. Water and land transportation were convenient, making it a vital route for north-south traffic. As mentioned earlier, Zheng merchants traveled to Qi, Zhou, Chu, and Jin. Although militarily and politically Zheng was caught between the major powers of Qi, Jin, and Chu, and the rivalry between Qi-Chu and Jin-Chu always involved fighting over Zheng first, causing it to be attacked from both sides for a long time, it benefited greatly economically. Zheng merchants transshipped goods from various countries and were very successful in international trade at the time, and Zheng also benefited. Second, there was the human factor, which involves the origin of the term "merchant." The Zuo Zhuan, Zhao Gong, year 16, records a very meaningful story:
    
    Han Qi (Xuanzi) of Jin went to Zheng to pay a diplomatic visit. He had a pair of jade rings, one of which was in the hands of a Zheng merchant. He wanted to reunite the pair and discussed it with the ruler of Zheng. Zichan, the chief minister of Zheng, refused, saying, "This is not government property, and the situation is not understood."
    
    Han Qi had to buy it from the merchant, and a deal was struck. The merchant said, "I still have to inform the government."
    
    Han Qi discussed it with Zichan again. Zichan said, "In the past, my late ruler Huan Gong and the merchants came from Zhou together. They worked shoulder to shoulder, clearing away the weeds and brambles, jointly developing this place, building cities, and getting along very well. They also made a covenant, vowing to abide by it for generations, which continues to this day. The covenant said: 'You shall not rebel, and I shall not forcibly buy, nor take, demand, or rob your goods. If you become wealthy, with profitable market treasures, I will not interfere.' Now you are here on a friendly visit, but you want our state to forcibly seize the goods of a merchant. Wouldn't this clearly teach us to break our covenant? I'm afraid that's not good. I think you would gain a ring but lose the feudal lords, and you certainly wouldn't do that."
    
    Third is the development of commodity production. It seems that the social production conditions at the time had already broken through the regional self-sufficient economic situation. Only when commodity production exceeds self-sufficiency is large-scale interregional exchange possible. From the records in Zuo Zhuan, although it only mentions the commodity exchange between Zheng, Jin, Qi, Zhou, and Chu, in fact, it was definitely not limited to these regions, which is conceivable. Although it only mentions the multi-regional commodity exchange of Zheng merchants, it can also be affirmed that merchants from other countries were also engaged in multi-regional commodity exchange under the same circumstances. These two stories illustrate: First, the merchants of Zheng came from Zhou with the founding ruler of Zheng and jointly developed Zheng. Second, the ruler of Zheng and the merchants made a covenant. The content was that the merchants guaranteed not to rebel and to support the Zheng ruler, and Zheng protected commerce, with clear provisions for protection. From this, it can be seen that, in addition to agriculture, Zheng had relied on merchants and developed commerce since its founding, gaining benefits from domestic and international commodity exchange. It can also be seen that, during the Spring and Autumn period, although Zheng suffered the most, the greatest, and the longest war disasters, it was still able to barely stand until it was destroyed by Han after the division of Jin into three. Third is the situation of commodity production and commodity exchange in the Spring and Autumn period. Although wars occurred constantly between various countries for a long time, it did not hinder the commodity exchange activities of merchants between countries. From these situations, we can also see the development of social productive forces at that time.

    郑国的商人
    刘勉之
    春秋时代郑国的商人最活跃。左传里曾有记载。最有名是弦高犒师的故事。秦兵偷袭郑国，经过滑国的时候，郑商人弦高到周去作生意，路上碰到敌兵，弦高急中生智，用十二条牛劳军。秦军以为郑国有备，只好灭滑而还（僖公三十三年）。其次是晋国荀罃被楚国俘虏，郑国的贾人打算把他夹带在贩运的绵衣中偷运出境。准备好了，楚国却释放荀罃回国。后来郑贾人到晋国作买卖，荀罃很感激他，十分款待。郑贾人过意不去，转到齐国作买卖去了（成公三年）。从这两个故事看来，郑国商人北到周，南到楚，西到晋，东到齐。不但到处作生意，看来气派还很大，一个假冒他的国家慰劳敌军，一个帮助晋国将领逃亡，都不是作小买卖的人所能干的。
    还有，商人这一行业似乎还被社会所尊重，有人取作名字，齐国一个贵族就名叫商人（文公三年）。至少地位在皂隶之上，排列的顺序是庶人、工、商、皂隶、牧、圉（襄公十四年）。当然，排列的地位在庶人、工之下，看来贵族是不屑于干这一行的。他们在社会上起互通有无的作用，所以有“同恶相求，如市贾焉”的话（昭公十三年韩宣子语）。
    为什么郑国的商人最活跃呢？第一是郑国的地理位置适中，郑国位于济、洛、河、颍四水之间，以今河南新郑为首邑，水陆交通便利，为南北必经的要道。郑的商人如前所说，足迹遍及齐周楚晋。虽然在军事、政治上郑介于齐、晋、楚几大国之间，齐楚、晋楚争霸，都要先打郑国，长期间两面挨打，是霸国必争之地，但在经济上却大占便宜，郑的商人转运各国商品，在当时国际上很吃得开，郑国也得到好处。第二是人的因素，这就牵涉到商人这一名词的由来了。左传昭公十六年纪载了一段极有意义的故事：
    晋国韩起（宣子）到郑国聘问。他有一对玉环，其中一个在郑国商人手上。想拼齐一对，和郑的国君商量。郑国执政子产不答应，说：“这不是官府的东西，情况不了解。”
    韩起只好向商人去买，已经成交了。商人说：“还得告诉一下政府。”
    韩起再和子产商量。子产说：“从前我先君桓公和商人都是从周来的。肩并肩地劳作，斩除蓬蒿藜藋，共同开发这个地方，建立城市，共处得很好。还立了盟誓，世代相守，一直到今天。誓约说：‘你不要造反，我也不强买，也不取讨和抢劫你的东西。你发了财，有利市宝贿，我也不干预。’现在你是为友好来访问的，可是却要敝邑强夺商人的货物，这不是明教我们破坏盟誓吗？怕不大好。我想你得了环，却失了诸侯，一定不干。”
    第三是商品生产的发达，看来当时的社会生产状况，已经突破了地区性的自足自给的经济情况了。只有在商品生产超过自给自足的基础上，才会有大规模的地区间的广泛交换的可能。从左传的记载看，虽然只提到郑、晋、齐、周、楚之间的商品交换，但是，事实上决不只这些地区，是可以想见的。虽然只提到郑国商人的多地区的商品交换，但是，也可以肯定，别国的商人，也是在同样情况下，在进行多地区间的商品交换的。这两个故事说明：第一，郑的商人是和郑的开国国君一起从周来的，共同开发了郑国。第二，郑国国君和商人订了盟誓，内容是商人保证不造反，支持郑君，郑国呢，保护商业，一条条规定了明确保护办法。由此可见，除了农业以外，郑国从开国以来，就一直依靠商人，发展商业，取得国内和国际商品交换的利益的。也可以看出，在春秋时代，虽然郑国所受战争的祸害最多最大最久，却终能勉强站住，一直到三家分晋以后才为韩所灭的道理。第三是春秋时代的商品生产和商品交换的情况。虽然，在长期间各国之间不断发生战争，但是，并没有妨碍各国间商人的商品交换活动。从这些情况中，也可看出当时社会生产力的发展情况。
