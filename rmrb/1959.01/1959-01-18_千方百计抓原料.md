    Reported by our newspaper: The vast number of workers in the national paper industry and related leadership departments are exhausting every means to open up sources of papermaking raw materials, and have achieved significant results.
    This year, China's paper production will have a large increase, but the main fiber raw materials for paper production, such as wood and reeds, cannot fully meet the needs. Major equipment used in papermaking, such as copper mesh on paper machines, water-pressing woolen cloth, caustic soda and sodium sulfide for cooking pulp, as well as auxiliary chemical raw materials such as rosin and aluminum sulfate to ensure that the paper has a certain water resistance, are also in short supply. In order to ensure a greater leap forward in paper production this year, the vast number of workers in the paper industry have come up with many good ways to overcome difficulties. For example, with the shortage of caustic soda, Hangzhou Xinhua Paper Mill extracts a mixed alkaline solution from the slag emitted from the alkaline furnaces of steel mills using an immersion method. The pulp cooked with this alkaline solution is just as good as the pulp produced with commercial alkali. Sichuan Zhongyuan Paper Mill uses indigenous methods to recover caustic soda and produce caustic soda from local alkali, and the results are very good. The Pulp and Paper Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry extracts alkaline solution from plant ash, which can also cook very good pulp. Now, the method of producing alum from boiler ash or white clay and sulfuric acid has been widely adopted. Sichuan Zhongyuan Paper Mill has also established its own sulfuric acid satellite factory. Many new methods have also been found to solve the problem of supplying copper mesh and woolen cloth, which are essential for paper machines. For example, many paper mills in Sichuan and Jiangxi have begun to make extensive use of bamboo curtains and melton cloth instead of regular copper mesh and woolen cloth on small paper mills and dewatering machines.
    In terms of fiber raw materials, the paper industry in Liaoning Province uses a large amount of reeds, which were previously imported from other provinces. Although the province has reed production bases, the annual output is only more than 100,000 tons. Last year, through large-scale high-yield experimental fields, high-yield reed ponds with an annual output of ten tons per hectare have been cultivated. This year, the planned annual output of reeds is 300,000 tons, which is more than double that of last year; at the same time, the province will also cultivate new reed fields near Andong with an annual output of 100,000 tons, so that reeds can gradually become completely self-sufficient. Large reed pulp mills in Tianjin, Yingkou, and Jincheng will also make extensive use of agricultural and sideline products such as wheat straw and sorghum stalks to replace reeds for pulping. Kaishantun and Liaoyang Paper Mills, which originally used wood to produce high-grade cultural paper and industrial paperboard, are preparing to use some rice straw as a substitute raw material. Jiamusi Paper Mill is preparing to use unpeeled logs to produce kraft paper, in order to greatly reduce the consumption of logs. (Attached picture)
    In the battle to increase paper production with all our strength, the workers of Guangzhou Paper Mill successfully tried to use local bagasse and rice straw instead of wood to make paper, so that the entire factory can fully exert its production potential and increase this year's paper production to 100,000 tons, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. This is them loading bagasse into the boiler, preparing to pulp it for papermaking. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jiachang

    千方百计抓原料
    本报讯　全国造纸工业广大职工和有关领导部门正在千方百计开辟造纸原料的来源，并已收到显著效果。
    今年我国纸张产量将有很大增长，而生产纸张的主要纤维原料如木材、芦苇等，还不能完全满足需要。造纸用的主要器材如造纸机上的铜网、压水毛布，蒸煮纸浆用的火碱、硫化碱以及保证使纸张能有一定抗水性能的松香、硫酸矾土等辅助化工原料也都感到不足。为了保证今年纸张生产更大的跃进，造纸工业的广大职工想出了很多克服困难的好办法。例如火碱不足，杭州新华纸厂从炼钢厂碱性炉喷出的炉渣中，用浸洗法提出一种混合碱液，用这种碱液蒸煮的纸浆和用商品碱生产的纸浆同样良好。四川中元纸厂用土法回收火碱及用土碱生产火碱，效果都很好。轻工业部制浆造纸研究所从草木灰中提取碱液，也能蒸煮出很好的纸浆来。现在，用锅炉炉灰或白土及硫酸来生产矾土的方法已被普遍采用。四川中元纸厂还专门建立了自己的硫酸卫星厂。解决造纸机上必不可少的铜网毛布供应问题，也找到了许多新办法，如四川、江西许多纸厂已开始在小型纸厂及脱水机等设备上大量利用竹帘和大衣呢代替正规造纸用的铜网毛布。
    在纤维原料方面，辽宁省造纸工业部门用苇数量很大，过去都是由外省输入。本省虽有产苇基地，年产只有十多万吨。去年通过大搞高产试验田，已培养出每公顷年产十吨的高产苇塘，今年计划年产苇三十万吨，比去年要加一番；同时该省还将在安东附近培植年产苇十万吨的新苇场，使苇子能逐步作到完全自给。天津、营口、金城等大苇浆厂还将大量利用麦秆、高粱秆等农副产品代替芦苇制浆。原来单纯采用木材生产高级文化纸和工业纸板的开山屯及辽阳两纸厂，都准备用部分稻草作为代用原料。佳木斯造纸厂准备用不去皮的原木生产纸袋纸，以大大降低原木消耗。（附图片）
    在全力增产纸张的战斗中，广州造纸厂职工试用当地的蔗渣、稻草代替木材造纸成功，使全厂能够充分发挥生产潜力，将今年纸产量提高到十万吨，比去年增产50％以上的纸张。这是他们把蔗渣装进锅炉，准备化浆造纸。　新华社记者　张家昌摄
