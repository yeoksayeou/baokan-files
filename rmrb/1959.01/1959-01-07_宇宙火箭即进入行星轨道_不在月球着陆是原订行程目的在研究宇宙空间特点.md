Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: TASS reported from Moscow at 22:30 on January 5th (03:30 Beijing time on January 6th): The orbital period of the Soviet artificial planet revolving around the sun has been determined to be 450 Earth days, not 447 Earth days.

The space rocket launched by the Soviet Union on January 2nd will finally enter the periodic orbit of an artificial planet on January 7th or 8th.

After entering the orbit of an artificial satellite of the sun, the space rocket will operate in an approximately circular path.

The longest diameter of the artificial planet's orbit is 343.6 million kilometers, and the orbital period is about fifteen months.

The eccentricity of the elliptical orbit is 0.148, and the long axis of the artificial planet's orbit will form a 15-degree angle with the long axis of the Earth's orbit. The orbital plane of the artificial planet is almost the same as the plane of the Earth's orbit.

When the Soviet artificial planet is running along its orbit, it will reach perihelion (the point closest to the sun) on January 14, 1959. At this time, it will be approximately 146.44 million kilometers away from the sun.

The artificial planet will reach aphelion (the point farthest from the sun) in early September 1959, at which time it will be 197.2 million kilometers away from the sun.

The orbit of the artificial planet lies between the orbits of the Earth and Mars.

The minimum distance between the orbit of the artificial planet and the orbit of Mars is about 15 million kilometers, which is about a quarter of the distance between the Earth and Mars during Mars' great opposition.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: Some people have asked why the Soviet space rocket only passed through the lunar region without landing and suddenly became a solar planet? Is this due to a malfunction in the calculation and control mechanism? These questions were addressed in articles published in today's "China Youth Daily" and "Red Star".

The article in "China Youth Daily" stated that these questions arise because of a lack of understanding of the purpose of this space rocket launch. The mission of this space rocket was to go into space, to reach or even exceed the second cosmic velocity. The mission of the scientific instruments it carried was to study the characteristics of outer space, especially the space near the moon. The rocket entered orbit exactly as calculated in advance, which is a remarkable and astonishing victory. The rocket's proximity to the moon was just enough to obtain the richest material on the moon's magnetic field and its radioactivity.

The article in "Red Star" said: After the Soviet space rocket broke free from the Earth's gravity at the second cosmic velocity, the moon's gravity acted on the rocket's parabola. However, because the rocket was moving very fast, the influence of this gravity was not enough to change the direction of its flight. At this time, the sun's gravity had a great influence on the rocket, gradually making its flight path elliptical and orbiting the sun. In this way, the space rocket became a satellite of the sun, that is, an artificial planet of the solar system. It is calculated that the maximum diameter of the Soviet artificial planet's orbit should be 343.6 million kilometers. It takes fifteen months to orbit the sun once.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: Soviet technology has the realistic preconditions to launch objects like the first American satellites into interstellar space, freeing them from the sun's gravitational range, that is, overcoming the so-called third cosmic barrier. This is the conclusion reached by Ilyushin, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in "Soviet Russia".

Shalonov, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, wrote in this newspaper that the Soviet space rocket is the first explorer of the universe. Now it is necessary to imagine sending rockets with radiation belts on space voyages. It is the task of our generation for mankind to go to the moon, and there is no doubt that this task will be solved in the near future.

Another article in "Soviet Russia" discussed the issue of flying to Mars. The article stated that Soviet scholars only spent a year going from the first cosmic velocity to the second cosmic velocity. And to go to Mars, only a slightly larger velocity than the second cosmic velocity is required.

Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: According to TASS, Soviet scientist Professor Shmakov said that the successful launch of the Soviet space rocket and its ejection of sodium clouds indicate that the problem of space television—transmitting television to both hemispheres of the Earth—is about to be practically solved.

The expert who studies the use of celestial bodies, especially the surface of the moon, to relay television said that the creation of artificial clouds by space rockets is of great significance. Artificial clouds can be used to reflect radio waves to the ground. Just two such clouds orbiting the Earth every 24 hours would be enough to broadcast television to the entire Earth.

Shmakov also pointed out that the significance of the launch of the Soviet Union's first multi-stage space rocket is currently difficult to fully realize and it is difficult to imagine its entire impact on mankind. But one thing is undeniable: this is a bold first step towards humans flying to other planets. What remains is to solve the problems of the safe return of the spacecraft to the ground and manned rocket flight. Once these problems are solved, mankind's ideal of interplanetary travel will be realized.

### 宇宙火箭即进入行星轨道  不在月球着陆是原订行程目的在研究宇宙空间特点

    宇宙火箭即进入行星轨道
    不在月球着陆是原订行程目的在研究宇宙空间特点
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科时间5日二十二时三十分（北京时间6日三时三十分）讯：苏联人造行星沿着自己的轨道围绕太阳运行的周期据确定不是四百四十七个地球日，而是四百五十个地球日。
    苏联在1月2日发射的宇宙火箭将在1月7、8日最后进入人造行星的周期轨道。
    宇宙火箭在进入了人造太阳卫星的轨道后，即将作接近于圆形的运行。
    人造行星轨道的最长直径为三亿四千三百六十万公里，而运行周期约为十五个月。
    椭圆形轨道的偏心率为零点一四八，人造行星轨道的长轴将同地球轨道的长轴成十五度角。人造行星的轨道平面同地球轨道的平面几乎是一致的。
    苏联人造行星在沿着轨道运行时，在1959年1月14日将到达近日点（离太阳最近的一点）。这时它距太阳大约一亿四千六百四十万公里。
    人造行星将在1959年9月初到达远日点（离太阳最远的一点），那时它距太阳一亿九千七百二十万公里。
    人造行星的轨道位于地球和火星的轨道之间。
    人造行星轨道和火星轨道之间的最小距离约为一千五百万公里，这个距离大约为火星大冲时地球和火星距离的四分之一。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　有人说，为什么苏联宇宙火箭只是经过月球区域而不着陆，忽然又成了太阳行星？这是不是由于计算和控制机构出了毛病？在今天“共青团真理报”和“红星报”所刊载的文章中谈到了这些问题。
      “共青团真理报”上的文章说，这些问题的产生是因为不了解这次发射宇宙火箭的目的引起的。这支宇宙火箭的任务是到宇宙空间去，是要达到甚至超过第二宇宙速度。它所携带的科学仪器的任务就是要研究宇宙空间，特别是月球附近区域的宇宙空间的特点。火箭完全按照预先所计算的那样进入了轨道，这是卓越而惊人的胜利。这个火箭接近月球的程度恰好足以获得关于月球磁场及其放射性的最丰富的材料。
      “红星报”的文章说：苏联宇宙火箭以第二宇宙速度挣脱了地球的引力后，月球的引力就对火箭的抛物线起作用，但由于火箭运行得十分迅速，所以这个引力的影响还不足以改变它飞行的方向，但这时太阳的引力对火箭又起着很大影响而使它的飞行路线逐渐成为椭圆形的，沿着太阳运行的轨道了。这样，宇宙火箭就成为太阳的卫星，即太阳系的一颗人造行星了。据计算，苏联人造行星轨道的最大直径应该是三亿四千三百六十万公里。它绕太阳一周需十五个月的时间。
    新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联的技术有现实的前提，足以把像第一批美国卫星那样的物体抛入恒星际空间，使其脱离太阳的引力范围，即克服所谓第三宇宙屏障。这是苏联科学院通讯院士伊利尤申在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上得出的结论。
    物理数学博士沙罗诺夫在这一报纸上写道，苏联宇宙火箭是宇宙的第一个勘察者。现在就需要设想放射带人的火箭到宇宙航程中去了。人类到月球上去是我们这一代的任务，毫无疑问，不久的将来就会解决这一任务。
      “苏维埃俄罗斯报”的另一篇文章谈到了飞上火星去的问题。文章说，苏联学者们只费了一年的时间便从第一宇宙速度达到了第二宇宙速度。而要到火星上去，只不过需要比第二宇宙速度略微大一些的速度就够了。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联科学家什马科夫教授说，苏联宇宙火箭发射成功及其喷出了钠云表明，宇宙电视——向地球两半球转播电视的问题即将得到实际解决。
    这位研究利用天体、特别是月球表面来转播电视的专家说，利用宇宙火箭造成了人造云，这是有重要意义的。人造云可以用来向地面反射无线电波。只要有两个每二十四小时绕地球运行一周的这样的云就足以向全地球转播电视了。
    什马科夫还指出，苏联第一个多级宇宙火箭发射的意义，在目前甚至很难充分地意识到，很难想像它对人类的整个影响。但有一点是无可怀疑的，这是走向人飞到其它行星去的勇敢的第一步。剩下的就是解决宇宙飞船顺利回到地面和载人的火箭飞行的问题了。这个问题一解决，人类关于行星际旅行的理想就将实现了。
