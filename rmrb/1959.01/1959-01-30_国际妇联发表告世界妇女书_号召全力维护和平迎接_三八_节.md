Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th. The Women's International Democratic Federation has issued an appeal to the women of the world, calling on women to maintain peace with all their strength to welcome "March 8th" International Women's Day.

The appeal to the women of the world said that the most heartfelt wish of all women is the happiness of their children and a bright future for mankind, so that everyone can enjoy the fruits of their labor and the achievements of human scientific discoveries in a peaceful environment.

The appeal to the women of the world pointed out that the main obstacle to realizing this wish is the arms race, especially the atomic arms race. Women must not allow spiritual and material wealth to be wasted in the arms race. Nuclear weapons testing must be stopped, atomic armaments must be prohibited, and universal disarmament must be implemented. The appeal to the women of the world finally called on women all over the world to demand peace from their national parliaments, governments, and the United Nations.

    国际妇联发表告世界妇女书
    号召全力维护和平迎接“三八”节
    新华社柏林29日电　国际民主妇女联合会发表了告全世界妇女书，号召妇女们以全力维护和平来迎接“三八”国际妇女节。
    告全世界妇女书说，全体妇女最衷心的愿望是她们孩子的幸福和人类美好的未来，这样，大家都能在和平环境中享受到自己的劳动果实和人类科学发现的成果。
    告全世界妇女书指出，实现这一愿望的最主要的障碍是军备竞赛，尤其是原子军备竞赛。妇女们决不能让精神和物质财富浪费在军备竞赛中。必须停止核武器试验，必须禁止原子军备，必须实行普遍裁军。告全世界妇女书最后号召全世界妇女向她们本国的议会、政府以及向联合国要求和平。
