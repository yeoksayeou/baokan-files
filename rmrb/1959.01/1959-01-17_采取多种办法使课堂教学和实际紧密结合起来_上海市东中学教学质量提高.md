Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th: Shanghai Shidong Middle School has adopted various methods to closely integrate classroom teaching with practice. This has not only improved teaching quality but also solved the problem of some students participating in productive labor in conjunction with their studies.

The first method they adopted was to integrate classroom teaching with actual production. For example, after learning about circuit connections in the third-year physics class, students were given the blueprints of the factory building that the school was about to construct. They were asked to design the lighting circuit diagram for the factory building. Under the guidance of teachers and electricians, they produced a relatively good construction drawing and carried out practical training. In the first-year biology class, in order to enable students to master the skills of using a microscope proficiently, the work of examining stool samples for the entire school was assigned as a practical assignment for the students.

The second method is to conduct on-site teaching in factories and rural areas to increase students' perceptual knowledge. When teaching about sulfuric acid production in the first-year chemistry class, classes were held at a nearby sulfuric acid plant, allowing students to clearly see the actual production equipment such as the combustion furnace, reaction tower, and absorption tower, as well as the connections between various devices. After the teacher's explanation, the students quickly understood the chemical principles of sulfuric acid production and the entire production process. Biology teachers, considering that deep plowing is an important experience in the great leap forward of agricultural production in our country, and also a practical production knowledge and skill that a new type of worker must master, decided to use the field as a classroom and organized students to participate in some labor, so that students understood what deep plowing, fertilization, etc., are all about. On this basis, discussions were held, and the teacher finally analyzed and summarized, so that students clearly understood the relevant scientific principles.

The third method is to invite workers, farmers, and other people with practical experience to teach together with teachers. For example, when third-year students were working in a radio equipment factory, the teacher taught the students the principles of radio and the circuit of a five-tube radio, while the workers taught the students the knowledge and skills of actual installation.

Another method is to organize students to visit, conduct surveys, and research. When teaching history to second-year students, students were asked to conduct surveys and research on the changes in the population composition, life, production, and rural outlook in rural areas since liberation while working in the countryside, collect data, and write rural investigation reports after returning to school.

In addition to the above methods, Shanghai Shidong Middle School also pays attention to the use of experiments, practical training, and teaching aids during class. At the same time, the school has also established political study groups, literary and art societies, and science and technology associations to organize students to carry out extracurricular activities. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the political counseling office specifically manages and arranges activity time, and teachers of various subjects are responsible for tutoring.

    采取多种办法使课堂教学和实际紧密结合起来
    上海市东中学教学质量提高
    据新华社上海16日电　上海市市东中学采取多种方法，使课堂教学和实际紧密结合。不但提高了教学质量，也解决了一部分学生结合学习参加生产劳动的问题。
    他们采用的第一种办法是结合生产实际进行课堂教学。像高三物理在学完电路的联接后，就把学校即将建造的厂房蓝图交给学生，让学生设计厂房照明线路图，在教师和电器工人的指导下，制成了一张较好的施工图，并进行实习。高一生物课为了使学生熟练地掌握显微镜的技能，便将全校检验大便的工作作为学生的实习作业。
    第二种是到工厂农村进行现场教学，增加学生感性知识。高一化学课讲授硫酸制造时，就到附近的硫酸厂去上课，让学生清楚地看到燃烧炉、反应塔、吸收塔等实际生产设备与各个装置间的联系，再经过教师讲解，学生很快就懂得了制造硫酸的化学原理和整个生产过程。生物课教师考虑到深翻地是我国农业生产大跃进的重要经验，又是一个新型劳动者必须掌握的实际生产知识和技能，就决定把田间当作课堂，并组织学生参加一部分劳动，使学生懂得了深翻、施肥等究竟是怎么一回事，并在这个基础上进行讨论，教师最后进行分析、总结，使学生清楚地理解了有关的科学原理。
    第三种是请工人农民等有实际经验的人与教师共同授课。如高三学生在广播器材厂劳动时，教师为学生讲无线电原理和五灯机的线路，工人则教学生实际安装的知识和技能。
    还有一种办法是组织学生参观访问、调查研究。高二学生在讲历史课时，曾让学生在农村劳动时对农村解放以来的人口成分、生活、生产以及农村面貌变化作调查研究、收集资料，回校后写成农村调查报告。
    除以上几种办法外，上海市市东中学在上课时还注意实验、实习和教具的运用，同时学校里还成立了政治学习会、文艺社和科学技术协会等，组织学生开展课外活动。在党支部领导下，由政治辅导室具体掌握和安排活动时间，各科教师分别担任辅导工作。
