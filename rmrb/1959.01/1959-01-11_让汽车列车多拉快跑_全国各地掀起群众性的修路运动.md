    Letting Motor Vehicle Trains Haul More and Run Faster
    A Mass Road Repair Movement Sweeps the Nation

    (By our newspaper) To adapt to the new situation of a substantial increase in road transportation tasks in 1959, and to create favorable driving conditions for motor vehicle trains, a mass road repair movement has been launched across the country. Mountainous roads are being reduced in steepness, and flat areas are widening roadbeds and surfaces, striving for all-weather traffic. Many places are improving road maintenance to ensure smooth passage for motor vehicle trains.
    In Henan Province's Xinxiang Special District, 1.8 million people were mobilized in November of last year. Party secretaries at all levels personally directed operations, and in seven days, 3,454 kilometers of roads were built and rebuilt, with all road surfaces paved with bricks, gravel, and stones. To ensure that the project quality met the requirements of straightness, flatness, solidity, and width, some places compacted the roadbed and surface twelve times and rolled it five times. The road width was generally twelve meters, allowing fully loaded motor vehicle trains carrying various materials to travel back and forth without obstruction.
    While building new roads, all areas also vigorously improved existing roads. The slogan was put forward: "Make steep slopes bow their heads, sharp bends straighten their waists, narrow roads widen, bridges and culverts strengthen, rain and snow clear, and adapt to train operation." By mid-November of last year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had improved 127 steep slopes and sharp bends, allowing motor vehicle trains to pass smoothly through 2,221 kilometers of roads. The Shaoguan Special District in Guangdong improved sharp bends, steep slopes, and narrow roads, basically adapting mountain roads to the operation of three- to five-trailer trains. The Ganzhou Special District in Jiangxi used various methods to reinforce wooden bridges, increasing their load-bearing capacity from about ten tons to about twenty tons, adapting them to the requirements of motor vehicle trains and heavy vehicles.
    To enable motor vehicle trains to run faster and haul more, various localities have begun to establish mass road maintenance organizations that combine labor and agriculture, providing regular maintenance to ensure that "once a road is built well, it is maintained well." Under the slogan of "People's Roads, People's Maintenance," Pinghe County in Fujian formed a commune road maintenance team of more than 390 people, dividing up sections and contracting them out, keeping the roads consistently flat and solid.

    让汽车列车多拉快跑
    全国各地掀起群众性的修路运动
    本报讯　为了适应1959年公路运输任务大量增加的新形势，并为汽车列车化创造有利的行驶条件，全国各地已先后开展了群众性的修路运动。山区公路正削减陡坡，平原地区正在拓宽路基路面，力求晴雨通车，许多地方都在改进养路工作，保证汽车列车通行无阻。
    河南省新乡专区在去年11月份内出动了一百八十万人，各级党委书记亲临前线指挥，在七天内就修建和改建了公路三千四百五十四公里，路面全部砖碴石子化。为了使工程质量达到直、平、实、宽的要求，有的地方将路基路面夯打了十二遍，磙碾了五遍，道路宽度一般为十二公尺，使满载各种物资的汽车列车往返奔驰，通行无阻。
    各地在新建公路的同时，对原有公路也大力进行了改善。提出了：“叫陡坡低头，急弯伸腰，窄路展宽，桥涵加固，雨雪畅通，适应列车化”的口号。广西僮族自治区至去年11月中旬止，改善了陡坡和急弯一百二十七处，使二千二百二十一公里的公路能顺利通过汽车列车。广东韶关专区改善急弯陡坡和窄路，基本上使山区公路适应了三挂至五挂的列车行驶。江西赣南专区用各种方法加固木桥，由原来通过十吨左右提高到二十吨左右，适应了汽车列车和重型车通过的要求。
    为了让汽车列车快跑多拉，各地开始建立亦工亦农的群众养路专业组织，经常养护，做到“修好一条，养好一条”。福建平和县在“人民公路人民养”的口号下，组成三百九十多人的公社养路队，分段包干，把公路养得经常平整坚实。
