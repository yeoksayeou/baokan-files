Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 9th: The Fujian Front Condolence Group, jointly formed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, concluded its condolence activities in Xiamen on the 7th.

　　During their ten days on the Xiamen Front, the Condolence Group went to artillery positions, naval bases, hospitals, sanatoriums, people's communes, and Xiamen University to extend cordial greetings to the military and civilians on the front line and celebrated New Year's Day of 1959 with them.

　　During the condolence activities, the members personally witnessed the unprecedented strength of the motherland's national defense, the great victories achieved by the officers and men of the front line in punishing the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and the outstanding contributions made by the heroic people of Xiamen in accelerating socialist construction and fighting side by side with the People's Liberation Army. They also witnessed the close unity and inseparable bond between the military and civilians on the front line. These deeply moved each member of the group. Huang Changshui, the head of the delegation, said excitedly: "The revolutionary heroism of all the military and civilians on the front line in battle, their high patriotism, and their noble communist style have given us extremely profound education." He resolutely stated that he would tell the vast number of overseas Chinese abroad and returned overseas Chinese in China about the noble qualities and heroic deeds of the military and civilians on the front line. Many of the members were overseas Chinese students who had recently returned from abroad. After arriving at the front line, they were constantly moved by the heroic deeds of the military and civilians there. They expressed their desire to learn from the People's Liberation Army's noble qualities of dedicating everything to the motherland.

　　During its stay in Xiamen, the Condolence Group received a warm welcome and reception from the leading organs of the garrison and the Xiamen Municipal Committee and Municipal People's Committee.

　　This Condolence Group was jointly formed by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and decided upon during the Third Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the First National Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese held in Guangzhou. The members of the Condolence Group included 160 returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students from Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, South Vietnam, Japan, and other places.

    新华社福建前线9日电　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会、中华全国归国华侨联合会联合组成的福建前线慰问团，7日结束了在厦门的慰问活动。
    慰问团在厦门前线的十天中，到炮兵阵地、海军基地、医院、休养所、人民公社和厦门大学等地向前线军民进行亲切的慰问，并和前线军民一起欢度了1959年的元旦。
    在慰问活动中，团员们亲眼看到了祖国国防力量的空前强大，看到了前线三军将士在惩罚蒋军的战斗中取得的伟大胜利，也看到了英雄的厦门人民在加速社会主义建设和解放军并肩作战中，作出的卓越贡献。还看到前线军民亲密无间的团结和鱼水相连的关系。这些深深感动了每个团员。团长黄长水激动地说：“所有前线军民在战斗中的革命英雄主义气概，高度的爱国主义精神和崇高的共产主义风格，都使我们受到极其深刻的教育。”他坚决表示要把前线军民的崇高品质和英雄事迹，告诉国外广大华侨和国内的归侨。团员中有许多不久前刚从国外归来的华侨学生，他们来到前线以后，时刻都为前线军民的英雄事迹所感动，他们表示要学习人民解放军一切为了祖国的高尚品质。
    慰问团在厦门期间，受到驻军领导机关和厦门市委、市人民委员会的热烈欢迎和接待。
    这个慰问团是由全国侨联一届三次全体委员（扩大）会议在广州开会时决定和中央华侨事务委员会联合组成的。慰问团成员包括来自印度尼西亚、马来亚、新加坡、菲律宾、泰国、缅甸、柬埔寨、南越、日本等地的归国华侨和归国华侨学生一百六十人。
