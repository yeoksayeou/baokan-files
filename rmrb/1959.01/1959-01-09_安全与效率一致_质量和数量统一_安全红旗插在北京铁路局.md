Safety and Efficiency are Consistent, Quality and Quantity are Unified
    Safety Red Flag is Planted in the Beijing Railway Bureau
    (Our report) The Ministry of Railways recently awarded a transportation safety red flag to the Beijing Railway Bureau. This bureau made remarkable achievements in safe driving in December of last year.
    With the great leap forward in socialist construction, the transportation work of the Beijing Railway Bureau, located in the capital, has also made a great leap forward. Compared with January of last year, the number of loaded cars increased by 71%; the vehicle turnaround time in the fourth quarter of last year was shortened to 1.33 days, a reduction of 0.26 days compared to 1.59 days in the same period in 1957. However, new imbalances also emerged in transportation work, and some shortcomings arose, such as the train operation order was not good enough, and the on-time rate of passenger and freight trains was low.
    The main experience of the Beijing Railway Bureau in safe driving is: the Party committee has strengthened its leadership in this area, implemented the principle of putting politics in command in safety work, and launched a vigorous mass movement. Since November of last year, the Party Committee of the bureau has continuously carried out several mass movements centered on ensuring safety and good order.
    This movement was first carried out among cadres. When organizing cadres to "engage in theoretical study," in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the comprehensive viewpoint of leading production was clarified, with production, thought, life, and safety being grasped together. It was emphasized that more, faster, better, and more economical are inseparable, and that revolutionary vigor must be combined with scientific analysis. Persuasive education was conducted on the one-sided views and practices of some cadres who opposed safety and efficiency, quantity and quality.
    On the basis of helping cadres clarify policies and ideas, a great debate was immediately launched among the masses. Employees of the bureau posted more than 50,000 big-character posters, summarizing experiences and making suggestions. Through some typical facts, cadres and employees received a good self-safety education. Many units also held exhibitions and experience exchange meetings to spread the good people, good deeds, and good experiences that have been successful in safety work for a long time. At the same time, propaganda teams and film teams were organized to go to people's communes and construction sites along the railway line to carry out extensive safety publicity to commune members and laborers in various literary and artistic forms that the masses love to see and hear. In the Jinpu line between Tianjin and Dezhou alone, 97,320 people were publicized.
    During the mass mobilization and airing of views, the situation of breaking down old rules and establishing new ones was also checked and rectified. It was clarified that breaking down must be followed by establishing. What should not have been broken down but was broken down, what should have been broken down but was not broken down, and what was broken down but not established. On this basis, all stations relied on the masses to universally revise the "Station Management Rules," fixing some effective systems to ensure safety. With a mass base for the rules and regulations, cadres and employees understood that breaking superstitions should be distinguished from respecting science, and a new atmosphere of "everyone does not violate regulations, everyone opposes violations" has begun to emerge.
    In order to ensure safety, many preventive measures have also been taken. All units have established a system for analyzing, researching, and handling accidents; organizations of safety supervision correspondents have been established and improved to give play to the role of mass supervision. At the same time, corresponding measures have been taken to solve the living problems of employees, such as running canteens, dormitories, and nurseries well, and arranging working hours so that the production, life, and study of employees can be carried out rhythmically, ensuring that they are energetic in production.
    The bureau has vigorously strengthened safety and order in transportation ideologically and organizationally, making good preparations for a greater leap forward in this year's transportation work.

### 安全与效率一致　质量和数量统一  安全红旗插在北京铁路局

    安全与效率一致　质量和数量统一
    安全红旗插在北京铁路局
    本报讯　铁道部最近把一面运输安全红旗奖给北京铁路局。这个局去年12月份在安全行车方面作出了显著的成绩。
    随着社会主义建设事业的大跃进，位于首都的北京铁路局的运输工作也有了大跃进，去年11月和1月比较，装车增加71％；车辆周转时间去年第四季度缩短到一点三三天，比1957年同期的一点五九天压缩了零点二六天。但运输工作也出现了新的不平衡，曾产生了一些缺点，如行车秩序不够好，客货列车正点率较低等等。
    北京铁路局安全行车的主要经验是：党委加强了这方面的领导，在安全工作中贯彻政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，这个局的中共党委从去年11月份以来，曾连续开展了几次以保证安全和良好秩序为中心内容的群众运动。
    这个运动首先是在干部中进行的。在组织干部“务虚”的时候，根据党的八届六中全会精神，明确了领导生产的全面观点，生产、思想、生活、安全一起抓，强调多快好省不可分割和革命干劲必须同科学分析相结合，对部分干部把安全与效率、数量与质量对立起来的片面观点和做法进行了说服教育。
    在帮助干部明确政策思想基础上，紧接着就在群众中展开大鸣大放大辩论，全局职工共贴出大字报五万多张，总结经验，提出建议，通过一些典型事实，使干部和职工受到一次很好的自我安全教育。许多单位还举办了展览会、经验交流会，传播长期来安全工作做得好的好人、好事、好经验。同时，组织了宣传队、电影队，到沿线的人民公社和工地，以群众喜闻乐见的各种文艺形式，向社员和民工们广泛进行安全宣传。仅天津到德州间津浦沿线受到宣传的就有九万七千三百二十人次。
    在发动群众鸣放中，对规章制度大破大立情况，也进行了检查和整顿。明确大破还必须大立。哪些是不该破的破了，哪些是该破的未破，哪些是破了未立。在这个基础上，各个车站依靠群众普遍修订了“车站管理细则”，把一些保证安全行之有效的制度固定下来。规章制度有了群众基础，干部和职工懂得了破除迷信与尊重科学应区别开来，目前开始出现了“人人不违章，人人反违章”的新气象。
    为了保证安全，还采取了不少预防的措施。各单位建立了对事故分析研究处理的制度；建立与健全了安全监察通讯员的组织，发挥群众监督的作用。同时，对解决职工生活问题采取了相应的措施，办好食堂、宿舍、托儿所，安排劳动时间，使职工群众的生产、生活、学习有节奏地进行，保证在生产中精力充沛。
    这个局从思想上和组织上大力加强运输中的安全和秩序，为今年的运输工作更大的跃进作了很好的准备。
