Ten Major Transformations
—Jingye Machine Factory Uses Indigenous Machine Tools to Build Rolling Mills
By Our Correspondent He Changhua

In November of last year, the national steel production target of 10.7 million tons was nearing completion. In many areas, the steel ingots produced were piled up like small mountains, and there was a great need for rolling mills everywhere to turn the ingots into steel. However, the Shanghai Jingye Machine Factory, which had undertaken the task of manufacturing many sets of rolling mills, had not yet started manufacturing, even after four months since receiving the task in July!

At that time, a new factory building of nearly 10,000 square meters had been built, but there was no equipment inside. More than a month later, as if by magic, two sets of medium-sized rolling mills were suddenly manufactured here. In addition, two other sets were more than 90% processed, and three other sets were about half processed. They were all behemoths. It was truly a miracle!

There were no magicians here; this was a living reality. It turned out that the factory's employees had built more than sixty indigenous machine tools in more than a month, arming the new workshop.

When people first came to this workshop, they only saw workpieces piled up everywhere—huge rough castings of main components. The workers were also busy producing, but for a while they could not find the machine tools. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that many small indigenous machine tools were hidden next to, on top of, and inside the rough castings.

These indigenous machine tools may not look impressive, but they were very powerful. Turning, boring, planing, milling—they had everything. They were a complete set of indigenous equipment for manufacturing rolling mills, forming an automated production line specifically for manufacturing rolling mills. This factory was an example of completing the arduous task of manufacturing rolling mills quickly, well, economically, and efficiently.

Jingye was a factory expanded from the merger of dozens of small factories. Most of the machinery was small, and the technical level of the entire factory's workers averaged only Grade 2. When they received the task of producing rolling mills, they faced a pile of contradictions: a large task, urgent time, large products, small equipment, new products, and low technology. Many people had hoped to resolve the contradictions by relying on the higher authorities to give them a large number of large, foreign machine tools, believing that it would be impossible to complete such a heavy task without them. However, July, August, September… time passed day by day, and the foreign machine tools did not arrive no matter how long they waited, and the manufacture of rolling mills had not yet begun!

The leaders of this factory had also tried to rely on their own efforts to arm themselves, but they did not consult with the workers adequately. The technical personnel of the technology section designed several so-called "indigenous" machine tools, but they could not escape the confines of foreign machine tools. One gantry milling machine, according to calculations, would require thirty tons of steel plates, twenty tons of steel castings, twenty tons of pig iron, and twenty tons of cement… This was truly like trying to put out a fire with water that was too far away.

The rough castings of the main components of the rolling mills were moved into the factory one by one, and the days became more and more urgent. The Party Secretary of a steel plant in Anhui, carrying a banner, rushed to Jingye. He said that their factory had been built, and they had also produced many steel ingots, and they were just waiting for the rolling mill, "like having a son but no wife, and no way to have a grandson." These words made the employees of Jingye feel both honored and anxious.

Finally, starting in late November of last year, this factory chose the path of mobilizing the masses to build indigenous machine tools to arm themselves. The whole factory held an inspiring mobilization meeting. The leadership laid out the heavy task of manufacturing rolling mills and the difficulties in completing the task to the masses.

Immediately, a vigorous mass movement arose, and it was boiling everywhere. Indigenous machine tools sprang up like mushrooms after a rain.

Xu Xinkang, a worker who usually did not like to talk, was staring at a drawing of a gear in a daze. He was thinking about how to process this key part of the rolling mill. He thought: it would be best to build an indigenous machine tool and lie on the large gear to process it. Then, he came up with one specific plan after another, but they were rejected by himself one after another. He talked about this idea with workers Wang Jianhong and Qian Jianzhong, and it immediately aroused their great interest. The three of them got together, and they created a specific plan with each of them contributing a sentence or two, and immediately drew a rough sketch. They were extremely excited, and they also named their creation "Little Monkey Riding an Elephant" based on the image of the processing.

"Little Monkey Riding an Elephant" is using a small, simple gear milling machine (little monkey) to lie on a herringbone gear rough casting (elephant) that is more than one meter high and weighs about fourteen tons, to mill teeth for it. Processing this kind of gear is currently a weak link in China's machinery industry. In principle, it requires a large hobbing machine with a complex structure to process, but this kind of machine is currently very rare in China. Jingye's creation has found a new key to overcome this weak link.

Li Guangren, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Machinery Industry, came to the factory and saw the rough sketch of "Little Monkey Riding an Elephant." He immediately signed and approved the required materials, and immediately picked up the phone and called the product design company of the bureau, asking them to quickly send technical personnel to help design the drawings. Wang Jianhong and more workers enthusiastically participated in the manufacturing. After seven days of effort, the little monkey finally rode on the elephant.

The introduction of the "Little Monkey Riding an Elephant" creation had a great impact on the workers throughout the factory, and the morale of the masses was even higher. At this time, the Party Branch paid special attention to protecting the enthusiasm of the masses and not wasting the energy of the masses. The Party promptly discovered such a situation: some of the same indigenous machine tools, some places wanted to build, other places also wanted to build, and other very needed machine tools, but no one built. Therefore, it instructed relevant departments to specifically convene a batch of veteran workers, production backbones and cadres to hold indigenous machine tool supply and demand meetings, carefully calculating and conducting process line-ups to see if each process of the main components of the rolling mill had indigenous machine tools. If not, immediately discuss how to rush to produce them. The Party Branch also reorganized and unified the factory's workers and leadership strength according to the new needs of production, forming five shock brigades respectively for combat. It also organized technical personnel to go deep into the workshops and work with the workers to study and design together. The factory also held lively sports meetings and cultural and recreational evenings to regulate the workers' tense lives. The cooks added various types of buns, dumplings, and eight-treasure rice to ensure that the workers ate well. After this new deployment, the movement developed more healthily.

Many key problems in manufacturing rolling mills were solved in a short time. Milling spline shaft grooves is one of the weak links that the country has not yet overcome well. The indigenous four-axis spline milling machine created by Jingye employees is very efficient and solves this problem. They also put a small indigenous machine tool into the round hole in the middle of the large gear to mill grooves, calling it "Knife Hidden in the Belly," and the processing efficiency is higher than that of a large shear bed that costs hundreds of thousands of yuan to buy. The "combined machine tool" they created is composed of several indigenous machine tools joined together. They simultaneously cut around the frame of the rolling mill, some milling planes, some drilling holes, and some boring holes, which greatly improves processing efficiency.

After the masses acted, they built forty indigenous machine tools in just ten days, which basically solved the manufacturing problems of the entire set of rolling mills. Ten days changed the face, these ten days were ten days of a great revolution in Jingye.

Jingye is not particularly blessed and its production conditions are not superior. Why were they able to create such a great miracle? This is a particularly thought-provoking question. Experts from all over the country—representatives attending the National Rolling Mill Manufacturing Experience Exchange Conference in Shanghai—greatly admired the achievements of Jingye employees. They took notes and drew rough sketches in the workshop, but more importantly, they learned more valuable experiences that could not be expressed by data and sketches.

    十大的变革
    ——精业机器厂用土机床造轧钢机
    本报记者　贺昌华
    去年11月，全国一○七○万吨钢的任务快要完成了。不少地区炼出的钢锭堆得像小山一样，到处需要轧钢机，需要把钢锭变成钢材。可是，承担了好多套轧钢机制造任务的上海精业机器厂，从7月接下任务，到这时已经四个月了，还没有动手制造！
    那个时候，一个近一万平方公尺的新厂房已经盖起来了，可是厂房里面什么设备也没有。一个多月以后，好像变戏法一样，这里突然制造出了两套中型轧钢机，另外有两套已经加工90％以上，还有三套也加工了一半左右。它们都是些庞然大物。这真是奇迹！
    这里并没有魔术师，这是活生生的现实。原来，这个厂的职工群众一个多月造出了六十多台土机床，武装了新车间。
    人们初来这个车间的时候，只见到处堆放着工作物——庞大的主件毛坯，工人也在忙碌地生产，却一时找不到工作母机在哪里。再一细看，才发觉很多小小的土机床都躲在毛坯的旁边、顶上和内部。
    这些土机床看来其貌不扬，可是威力很大。车、镗、刨、铣，样样都有。它们是制造轧钢机的一套完整的土设备，组成了专门制造轧钢机的流水生产线。这个厂是多快好省地完成繁重的轧钢机制造任务的一个范例。
    精业是由几十个小厂合并后扩展成的工厂。机器设备大都是小型的；技术水平，全厂工人平均只有二级。当他们接到生产轧钢机的任务的时候，摆在面前的是一大堆矛盾：任务大、时间急，产品大、设备小，产品新、技术低。不少人曾把解决矛盾的办法，寄托在上级给他们大批大型的洋机床，认为没有它们便不可能完成这样繁重的任务。但是，7月、8月、9月……时间一天一天过去了，洋机床左等右等也不来，轧钢机的制造还没有动手！
    这个厂的领导人员也曾试图自力更生，自己武装自己，但是没有很好地同工人群众商量。技术科的技术人员设计出了几台所谓“土”机床，却跳不出洋机床的圈子。有一台龙门铣床，据计算，制造起来需要三十吨钢板、二十吨铸钢件、二十吨生铁和二十吨水泥……。这真是远水救不了近火。
    轧钢机的主件毛坯，一个个搬进工厂来了，日子越来越紧迫了。安徽一家钢铁厂的党委书记，带着锦旗，赶到精业来了。他说，他们厂房已经盖好，也炼出了好多钢锭，就等轧钢机了，“好比有了儿子，没有媳妇，没法抱孙子”。这席话使精业的职工感到又光荣又着急。
    终于，从去年11月下旬起，这个厂选择了发动群众人人动手大造土机床来武装自己的道路。全厂举行了一次振奋人心的动员大会，领导上把繁重的轧钢机制造任务和完成任务的困难全部向群众摊了牌。
    顿时，一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动起来了，到处沸腾，土机床如雨后春笋般地出来了。
    平时不爱讲话的工人许信康，拿了一张齿轮的图纸在发呆，他在思索加工轧钢机这个关键部分的加工方法。他想：最好造一台土机床，扑在大齿轮上加工。接着，他又想出一个又一个的具体方案，但却一个又一个地被自己推翻了。他把这个想法向工人王建宏和钱建中一谈起来，立刻引起他们很大的兴趣。三人凑在一起，你一句我一句地就创造出一个具体方案，并且马上画出了草图。他们兴奋极了，还根据加工的形象，把自己的创造取名为“小猴骑大象”。
    “小猴骑大象”是用小小的简易铣齿机（小猴），伏在一人多高、重约十四吨的人字齿轮毛坯（大象）上，为它铣牙。加工这种齿轮是当前我国机械工业的薄弱环节，按理需要用结构复杂的大滚齿机来加工，而这种机器目前国内很少。精业这一创造为克服这一薄弱环节找到了新的钥匙。
    上海市机械工业局局长李广仁，来厂里看到“小猴骑大象”的草图，马上签字批准了需要的材料，并且当场拿起电话，打给这个局的产品设计公司，要他们赶快派技术人员来帮助设计图纸。王建宏和更多的工人，热情地参加制造。经过七天的努力，小猴终于骑上了大象。
      “小猴骑大象”这一创造一提出，对全厂工人震动很大，群众的情绪更加高涨了。这时候，党总支特别注意爱护群众的积极性，不浪费群众的精力。党及时发现了这样一个情况：有的相同的土机床，这里也要造，那里也要造，另外的很需要的机床，却没有人造。于是指示有关部门，专门召集一批老工人、生产骨干和干部开土机床供需会议，算细账，进行工序排队，看轧钢机主件的每道工序是不是都有土机床。如果没有，就马上讨论如何赶制。党总支还根据生产的新需要，把全厂工人和领导力量重新统一集中，分别组成五个突击大队，进行战斗。并且组织技术人员们深入车间和工人们一起研究，一起设计。厂里还热热闹闹地举行了体育运动大会和文娱晚会，来调节工人们的紧张生活。炊事员们增加了各种包子、饺子、八宝饭等品种，保证工人吃好。经过这一番新的部署，运动更健康地向前发展。
    很多制造轧钢机的关键问题短时间就解决了。铣梅花轴槽是全国尚未很好克服的薄弱环节之一，精业职工搞出的土的四轴梅花铣，效率很高，解决了这一问题。他们还把一种小的土机床，放进大齿轮中间的圆洞里去铣槽子，呼之曰“肚里藏刀”，加工的效率比花几十万元买的大铡床还要高。他们创造的“联合机床”，是由几台土机床联合组成的。它们围绕着轧钢机的机架同时进行切削，有的铣平面，有的钻眼，有的镗孔，加工效率也大大提高。
    群众行动起来以后，不过十天的功夫，就造出了四十台土机床，已基本上解决了整套轧钢机的制造问题。十天改变了面貌，这十天，是精业大革命的十天。
    精业并不是得天独厚，生产条件并不优越。他们为什么能够创造出这样大的奇迹？这是一个特别发人深思的问题。来自全国各地的行家——在上海参加全国轧钢机制造经验交流会议的代表们，对精业职工的成就十分佩服。他们在车间里记了资料，画了草图，更重要的是他们学到了资料和草图所不能表达的更宝贵的经验。
