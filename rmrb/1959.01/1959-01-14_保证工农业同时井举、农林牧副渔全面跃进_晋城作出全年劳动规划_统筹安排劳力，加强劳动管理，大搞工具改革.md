According to a report from the Shanxi Daily, the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province recently formulated a preliminary plan for the rational arrangement and use of labor force, based on the county's plan for the comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries this year. It also proposed effective solutions to the labor shortage that may occur throughout the year.

Jincheng County has formulated a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan for this year than last year. According to the new plan, the county's total industrial and agricultural income will increase by 1.2 times compared to 1958. In industry, based on the rich local mineral resources and a relatively good industrial base, the county will focus on developing steel, machinery, and processing of agricultural, sideline, and special local products, and correspondingly develop mining, coal mining, building materials, and transportation. The total industrial output value of the county will increase by two times compared to 1958. At the same time, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will also achieve a comprehensive leap forward and integrated development. In agriculture, in addition to ensuring continued grain production increase, the county has also decided to allocate part of the cultivated land to develop oil crops, vegetables, and other cash crops. It will vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and various mountain and local specialties, and launch an "eight-raising" campaign of pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, silkworms, and bees.

When determining this year's production leap forward plan, the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly studied the issue of ensuring the realization of the annual plan from the perspective of rational arrangement and use of labor force. The study proved that the problem of labor shortage will run through all periods of the year as various production plans are implemented on schedule. However, as this problem is continuously solved, production will continue to reach climaxes. According to the county's plan for the comprehensive development of industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries this year, a total of 313,600 male and female full and semi-labor force are needed. Judging from the current situation, excluding those who have been transferred to participate in industrial production and construction, the total number of male and female full and semi-labor force that can work in the county is 252,966, which means a shortage of more than 60,000 labor force.

In order to make rational arrangements for the limited labor force and use it properly, the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first, following the principle of ensuring key tasks and taking care of general tasks, conducted a thorough investigation of the labor force needs of various production and construction projects this year and the changes throughout the year, and made comprehensive arrangements based on the results of the investigation. Based on the need to ensure intensive cultivation and comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries on the county's 1.8 million mu of "basic farmland," it was decided that 73.6% of the total labor force in the county would be engaged in these production activities. With the development of local industry, the labor force participating in industrial production and construction in the county is planned to increase from 16% of the total industrial and agricultural labor force in 1958 to 26.4%. In the specific arrangement of the labor force, in addition to focusing on guaranteeing the labor force needed for "basic farmland," the development of diversified economy, and steel and machinery, the labor force needed for related coal mining, mining, transportation, building materials, light industry, and daily necessities, which serve these key production and construction projects, were also appropriately arranged.

Jincheng County's labor plan first emphasizes seriously strengthening labor management and fully exploiting the potential of the existing labor force. In particular, it proposes two important solutions to the problem of labor shortage:

The first solution is: (1) Regardless of industrial or agricultural production units or basic construction units, they need to strengthen leadership, manage at different levels, establish and improve specialized teams and carry out labor organizations that combine "multi-skilled" comprehensive work according to the needs and changes of production tasks, universally implement the responsibility system, and improve labor efficiency and quality; (2) In the grass-roots units of production and construction, it is required to adjust labor organizations and implement a responsibility system that combines scientific division of labor and collective labor according to the strength of the labor force, the level of technology, the weight of the work, and the expertise of each person, so as to make the best use of everyone's talents and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of each person in the labor process; (3) According to the changes in production tasks and the change of agricultural seasons throughout the year, as well as the increase in new production tasks, adjust and rectify labor organizations and allocate labor force in a timely manner to prevent uncoordinated phenomena such as labor shortages and idling waste caused by uneven busy and idle periods; (4) Mobilize more than 30,000 cadres and middle school students in the county to participate in agricultural production for an average of six labor days per person per year. This not only allows these people to receive ideological training, but also adds the equivalent of more than 600 labor force. The second important solution to solve the problem of labor shortage is to carry out a tool reform movement centered on "four localizations" (local machine tools, local machinery, local railways, local electric motors). The plan requires seizing the manufacture and use of local machinery that requires the most labor force and can save the most labor force. This year, the county plans to manufacture 2 million pieces of various local machinery and improved tools required for industrial and agricultural production and construction. Among them, it is planned to manufacture 120 ore crushers, which can not only reduce the labor intensity of workers, but also save 1,800 labor force; modify 25,000 iron-wheeled vehicles, which can save 25,000 labor force and 25,000 animal power. This year, it is also necessary to complete 309 kilometers of local railways and 10,000 meters of underground local railways in mines. In order to realize the above plan, we must first start with manufacturing machinery for manufacturing local machinery and tools for reforming tools, and take care of labor force arrangement from now on. It is required to complete the manufacturing task of 380 local lathes in the first quarter, so that each people's commune in the county has an average of 16 local lathes. After the realization of the plan for the production of local electric motors and local transformers throughout the year, all small iron factories and handicraft factories can be fully powered by electricity.

By implementing these two measures, the problem of labor shortage can be largely solved. At present, after preliminary rectification of labor organizations, more than 100,000 labor force in the county have already been dispatched to the construction sites of farmland water conservancy and local industrial production and construction, and the winter production combined with the rectification of communes has been vigorously launched. In the past two months, more than 130 sets (units) of various simple lathes, local lathes, mining machinery, and various power equipment have been manufactured, 6 kilometers of local railways have been completed, and agricultural and other mechanical equipment have also been manufactured.

    保证工农业同时井举、农林牧副渔全面跃进
    晋城作出全年劳动规划
    统筹安排劳力，加强劳动管理，大搞工具改革
    据山西日报消息　中共山西晋城县委会最近根据今年全县工业和农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的计划，相应地制订了劳动力的合理安排和使用的初步规划，并且对全年可能出现的劳动力不足的问题，提出了有效的解决办法。
    晋城县今年制订了比去年更大更好更全面的跃进计划。按照新的计划，今年全县工农业总收入将比1958年增加一点二倍。工业方面将根据当地矿产资源丰富、工业基础较好等条件，有重点地发展钢铁、机械和农副土特产品加工业，相应地发展采矿、采煤、建筑材料和交通运输，全县工业总产值将要比1958年增长两倍。同时农、林、牧、副、渔也要全面跃进，综合发展。在农业方面，全县除保证粮食继续增产外，还确定抽出部分耕地发展油料、蔬菜等经济作物。大力发展林业、畜牧业、副业和各种山货土特产，开展猪、羊、鸡、鸭、蚕、蜂等“八养”运动。
    中共晋城县委员会在确定今年生产跃进计划时，反复地研究了从劳动力的合理安排和使用方面保证全年计划的实现问题。研究的情况证明，随着各项生产计划的按期逐步实现，劳动力不足的问题，将会贯穿全年各个时期。但是，随着这个问题的不断解决，生产上便会随之不断出现高潮。按照全县今年工业和农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的计划，全年共需要男女全半劳动力三十一万三千六百人，从目前的情况来看，除已经外调参加工业生产和建设的以外，全县能够出勤的男女全半劳动力有二十五万二千九百六十六人，还缺少劳动力六万多人。
    为了使有限的劳动力，做到合理安排，使用得当，中共晋城县委会首先依照保证重点照顾一般的原则，对各项生产建设在今年劳动力的需要情况和全年各个时期的变化情况，进行了摸底排队，并且根据调查研究的结果，作了统筹安排。根据全县一百八十万亩“基本农田”要求做到精耕细作和全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔多种经济的需要，确定以占全县劳动力总数73.6％的劳动力从事这些生产活动。随着地方工业的发展，全县参加工业生产建设的劳动力，准备由1958年占工农业劳动力总数的16％增加到26.4％。在劳动力的具体安排上，除了重点保证“基本农田”、发展多种经营和钢铁、机械所需要的劳动力以外，对为这些重点生产建设服务和有关的采煤、采矿、交通运输、建筑材料、轻工业和生活用品等所需要的劳动力，也都分别相应作了适当安排。
    晋城县的劳动规划，首先注意认真加强劳动管理，充分发挥现有劳动力的潜力，特别是对劳动力不足的问题，提出了两项重要的解决办法：
    第一项办法是：（一）不论工农业生产单位或者基本建设单位，都需要加强领导，分级管理，按生产任务的需要和变化建立、健全专业队伍和开展“多面手”综合工作相结合的劳动组织，普遍推行责任制，提高劳动效率和质量；（二）在生产建设基层单位，要求按照劳动力的强弱、技术的高低、作活的轻重和各个人的专长，调整劳动组织，实行科学的分工和集体劳动相结合的责任制，以便做到人尽其力，在劳动过程中充分发挥各个人的积极性和创造性；（三）根据全年各个时期生产任务的变动和农事季节的变换、以及新的生产任务的增加等情况，及时调整、整顿劳动组织和调配劳动力，防止因为忙闲不均而造成的劳动力不足和窝工浪费等不协调现象；（四）发动全县干部、中学生等三万多人，全年平均每人参加六个劳动日的农业生产。这样不仅使这批人受到思想锻炼，并且增加了相当于六百多个劳动力。第二项解决劳动力不足的重要办法是，开展以“四土化”（土机床、土机械、土铁路、土电机）为中心的工具改革运动。规划要求抓紧制造使用劳动力最多和能够节省劳动力最大的土机械。今年全县计划制造的工农业生产建设需用的各种土机械和改良工具有二百万件。其中计划制造的矿石粉碎机一百二十部，这不仅可以减轻工人的劳动强度，而且可以节省一千八百个劳动力；改装铁轮车二万五千辆，可以节省劳动力二万五千个和畜力二万五千个。今年还要完成土铁路三百零九公里和矿井地下土铁路一万公尺。为了实现上述计划，先从制造土机械的机械和改革工具的工具制造着手，并且从现在开始在劳动力安排方面加以照顾，要求在第一季度完成三百八十部土车床的制造任务，做到全县每个人民公社平均有十六部土车床。全年生产的土电机、土变压器的计划实现后，所有小型铁厂和手工工厂将可全部用电力作动力。
    实现这两项措施，劳动力不足的问题就可以大体得到解决。目前，全县经过初步整顿劳动组织，已经开赴农田水利工地和地方工业生产建设战线的劳动力有十多万人，结合整社开展的冬季生产已经蓬勃展开。最近两个月已经制造的各种简易车床、土车床、矿石机械和各种动力设备已有一百三十多部
  （台），已经完成的土铁路有六公里，还制造了农业和其他机械设备。
