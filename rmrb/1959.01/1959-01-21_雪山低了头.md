    The Snow Mountains Bowed Their Heads
    By Our Correspondent Huang Changlu
    Yunnan Plateau is famous for its many mountains, and the Nu River Lisu Autonomous Prefecture has the most mountains. The minority nationalities in the Yunnan border area live in poverty, and the Lisu nationality is considered the poorest. It is this poorest border mountain area that has undergone astonishing changes last year, with grain production more than tripling in one year, transforming from a thousand-year grain-deficient area to one that is self-sufficient with a slight surplus.

    When I visited Nu River, I saw a slogan on the streets of Zhiziluo, the capital of the autonomous prefecture: "In the past, people worried when they saw mountains, but now mountains bow their heads to people!" These two sentences fully reflect the tremendous changes in the Lisu people.

    The Nu River is like a emerald green ribbon embroidered on the border of Yunnan. The Bilo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain stand opposite each other on both sides of the Nu River like two natural screens. Standing on the banks of the Nu River and looking up at the sky, the sky is narrow and long. The fields, villages, and streams on both sides of the river are like paintings hanging on the wall. I walked along the Nu River valley for three days and did not see a flat area wider than half a mile. Some slopes were so steep that people could barely stand, but the fields were all planted with crops. It is said that the Lisu people tie ropes around their waists and hang on the slopes to cultivate the land. From a distance, the terraces on the mountains look like rows of ladders leaning against the rocks. Some terraces are only one meter wide, and if oxen were used for plowing, they would not be able to turn around at all. However, rice still grows in the fields. One field was only the size of a square table, but people still meticulously leveled the ridges and planted dozens of clumps of rice seedlings in the field.

    During the long years when dark clouds shrouded the banks of the Nu River, when the Lisu people were still engaged in individual production, they had the ambition to conquer nature, but they could not become the masters of nature. At that time, they fought against the steep mountains with their bare hands. In the spring, they set fire to the forests, dug holes on the burned slopes with wooden hoes or sticks, dropped seeds, and waited for meager harvests. When the natural fertility of the land was exhausted, leaving only a "bone of the earth," they would burn another piece. The people here could not resist natural disasters. Droughts dried up the crops, heavy rains washed them away, and winds knocked them down. There was no year without disasters. The Lisu people suffered and starved year after year. They poured this painful feeling into a famous folk song:
  “The older people get,
    The poorer the land becomes.
    Which year, which month?
    Will people live forever,
    And the land become more fertile!”

    That time has finally arrived. When the Communist Party liberated the Lisu people from the shackles of reactionary rule and the exploiting classes, and when more than 20,000 individual Lisu farmers were led onto the broad road of cooperation, the desire to conquer nature, which had been buried deep in the hearts of the Lisu people for a long time, burst out like a wild horse and a breached dam, turning into a power to move mountains and overturn seas.

    Aduluo Township in Bijiang County is one of the poorest villages in the Nu River area. The 363 Lisu households in the township only harvested enough grain to eat for three months before liberation. Last year, the Party branch and the work team led the Lisu people in the township to vigorously develop water conservancy and open up new paddy fields. The source of one canal was at the top of the Bilo Snow Mountain, more than 4,000 meters above sea level. When the canal was being excavated at the source, it was snowing heavily. Many Lisu people insisted on staying at the construction site in order to complete the canal as soon as possible. Once, a strong wind and heavy snow swept across the mountain again, and the masses returned to the village to avoid the wind and snow, but nine people stayed at the construction site. For their safety, everyone advised them to leave. They resolutely replied: "We will wait until the ditch is completed, and we will return to the village with the water!" After that, the heavy snow continued to fall, and the nine people squeezed together in a thatched shed. They took out the wood from the shed in the snow to burn as firewood and ate corn flour mixed with snow water to satisfy their hunger. Even in this situation, the nine Lisu people still started work in the snow. They fought against the wind and snow for eight days, until the sky cleared, the accumulated snow gradually melted, and the masses returned to the construction site one after another. They were deeply moved to see the nine people still working. The canal was completed on schedule, and the nine Lisu people fulfilled their heroic promise—returning to the village with the water.

    In the struggle to conquer nature, the Lisu people not only have amazing determination and courage, but also demonstrate their rich wisdom. On the banks of the Nu River not far from Zhiziluo, there are large areas of fertile land belonging to the four clans of Puluo Township. Crops used to be grown there, but because there was no water, the crops did not grow well, so it was converted into pasture. Twenty years ago, the Kuomintang officials seized this land and attempted to build a dam on the nearby Zhiziluo River to block the river water flowing down from the snow mountain and irrigate this wasteland. The officials forcibly conscripted thousands of laborers on both sides of the Nu River, threatening them with whips to load stones into bamboo baskets and sink them into the river to cut off the flow. But the snow mountain did not submit to the officials. As soon as the dam was built, a flood from the mountain washed away the stones and even the bamboo baskets. The project lasted a whole year, and all the bamboo on the nearby mountains was cut down, but the dam was never built. When this land returned to the hands of the people of Puluo Township, how eager they were to divert the water from the snow mountain to turn it into fertile fields! But having learned from the past, they did not dare to act rashly. During the Great Leap Forward last year, Kaishan Yi, the Party branch secretary of Puluo Township, the son of a poor Lisu farmer, proposed that this water conservancy project must be completed. Kind-hearted old people reminded him: "The Kuomintang could not repair it well even with thousands of people. It is a waste of effort to repair it again." Landlords threatened him: "There is a ghost in that river. Whoever touches him will go crazy." Kaishan Yi ignored these warnings and threats. He firmly told everyone: "Today, the Party has sent cadres to lead us, the government has sent artillery rods and explosives to help us, and we have established seven cooperatives. As long as the four clans are of one mind, no matter how high the snow mountain is, we will make it bow its head; no matter how fierce the river is, we will make it give way!" All the poor farmers in the township supported Kaishan Yi's opinion. Regardless of which clan they belonged to, they all took their pots, stoves, and tools and rushed to the construction site. After Kaishan Yi and the work cadres studied the lessons of the Kuomintang officials' failure in the past, they decided not to adopt the method of building a dam to cut off the flow, but to dig a canal in the upper reaches of the Zhiziluo River so that the river water would flow from a high place to the wasteland. However, the canal needed to pass through a stone wall on the snow mountain. The stone wall was more than half a mile long and twenty feet high, standing like it had been split by a knife or ax. How could the canal pass through this cliff? When this difficulty was handed over to the masses in the township for discussion, someone proposed inserting a row of iron bars into the stone wall and erecting a wooden flume on top of them, so that the water could flow through the cliff in the flume. However, even monkeys and rock goats could not climb this overhanging cliff, so how could they go up to insert the iron bars? A brave Lisu youth named Yue Si first tied a rope around his waist and hung down from the top of the rock, building a pontoon bridge on the stone wall. People walked one after another on the pontoon bridge hanging in the air to work. The canal finally passed through the stone wall. But in front of it, they encountered a deep ravine. How could the canal water fly over the ravine? They would still use a flume to cross it. The ravine was more than ten feet wide. It was impossible to build such a long flume without pillars below. But the bottom of the ravine was too deep to build pillars. This problem stumped everyone again. Kaishan Yi stood by the ravine and pondered for a whole day. He suddenly remembered that when he went to Lanping County to transport salt in the past, he saw a bridge with a herringbone frame across a river. This inspiration made him think: "Wouldn't it be appropriate to support the flume with a herringbone frame?" Everyone followed his advice and finally erected the flume over the deep ravine. Thousands of difficulties and setbacks did not stump the Lisu people. Two months later, the entire canal was completed, and the generations-dry wasteland on the banks of the Nu River became 300 acres of fertile fields.

    The above story is just a few waves in the thousands of heroic deeds of the Lisu people. Thousands of small waves converge into a surging torrent; the power of thousands of ordinary Lisu people changes the landscape. In the past year alone, the Lisu people have dug 2,875 canals in the Bilo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain, and the snow water that had been flowing into the Nu River in vain for many years has been tamed and flowed into 80,000 acres of newly opened terraces.

    Times have changed, mountains and rivers have changed, and people's moods have also changed!

    Now, that sad folk song can no longer be heard on the banks of the Nu River. The Lisu people sing new folk songs with the heroic feeling of conquering nature:

    “In the past, when we looked at the sky, it was all dark,
    When we looked at the land, it was all one color;
    Now, when we look at the sky, there are many stars,
    When we look at the land, there are many paddy fields.”

    “Unity is stronger than the mountain,
    Split the mountain in half with one chop;
    Look at the road for cars on the top of the mountain;
    Look at the golden valley fields on the mountain slope.” The snow mountain bowed its head in front of the heroic Lisu people! (Attached picture)

    雪山低了头
    本报记者　黄昌禄
    云南高原以山多著名，山最多的是怒江傈僳族自治州；云南边疆的少数民族生活贫穷，最贫穷的民族要算傈僳族。就是这个最贫穷的边疆山区，去年却发生了惊人的变化，粮食产量在一年内猛增两倍以上，由千年缺粮区变为自给而略有余裕。
    我访问怒江的时候，在自治州首府知子罗的街头，看见一幅标语：“过去人见山发愁，现在山向人低头！”这两句话，充分地反映了傈僳人的巨大变化。
    怒江，像一条翠绿的缎带绣在云南边陲。碧罗雪山和高黎贡山如两座天然屏风对峙怒江两岸。站在怒江边上，抬头望天，天空是狭长的。两岸的田地、村庄和溪流，宛如挂在壁上的图画。我沿着怒江河谷走了三天，没有看见过一里宽以上的平地，有些坡地陡得连人也站不稳，但地里都种着庄稼，据说傈僳人是用绳子拴着腰，吊在山坡上种地的。远远望去，山上的梯田像一排排靠在岩上的梯子。好些梯田不过一公尺宽，要是用牛犁，牛根本无法掉转身子。但是，田里仍然长出了稻谷。有一块田只有一张方桌那么大，但人们仍然精心地把田埂挖得平平整整，在田里种植了几十丛稻苗。
    在乌云笼罩着怒江两岸的漫长岁月里，当傈僳人还是单家独户个体生产的时候，他们纵有征服自然的雄心壮志，却无法成为自然的主人。那时，他们凭着双手，向险峻的山岩搏斗。春天，放火烧了森林，用木锄或木棒在烧过的山坡上掘个窟窿，丢下种子，等待着微薄的收成。等土地的自然肥力耗尽，剩下一块“地骨头”后，便另烧一块。这里的人们无法抵抗自然灾害。天旱把庄稼晒死，大雨把庄稼冲走，风来把庄稼刮倒，无年不灾。傈僳人年年苦够了，年年饿够了。他们把这种痛苦的心情倾诉在一首著名的民歌里：
  “人越活越老，
    地越种越瘦。
    哪年哪月？
    人才能长生不老，
    地才能越种越肥！”
    这个年月终于盼到了。当共产党把傈僳人从反动统治和剥削阶级的桎梏中解放了出来，当两万多个体的傈僳农户被引上了合作化的康庄大道以后，长期埋藏在傈僳人心底的征服自然的愿望，便如脱缰之马，决堤之水，汹涌地奔放出来，变成移山倒海的力量。
    碧江县的阿斗罗乡是怒江区最穷苦的一个乡村。全乡三百六十三户傈僳人在解放前每年收获的粮食只够吃三个月。去年，党支部和工作队领导全乡傈僳人大兴水利，大开水田。有一条水渠的源头在拔海四千多公尺的碧罗雪山顶，当水渠开凿到源头时，正值大雪纷飞。许多傈僳人为了早日把水渠修通，坚持留在工地。有一次，山上又刮起了狂风大雪，群众都回村避风雪去了，独有九个人留在工地上。大家为了他们的安全，劝他们走。他们坚决的回答说：“要等水沟修通，人与水一齐回村！”以后大雪一直下着不停，九个人便一齐挤在一间草棚里。他们从雪堆里取出工棚的木料当作柴烧，捧些雪水，和着玉米粉充饥。就是在这种情况下，九个傈僳人仍然冒雪开工。他们一直与风雪搏斗了八天，天才放晴，积雪逐渐溶化，群众纷纷回到工地，看见九个人还在继续工作，都万分感动。这条水渠如期完成了，九个傈僳人实现了自己的英雄诺言——与水一齐回村。
    傈僳人在征服自然的斗争中不仅有着惊人的决心与魄力，也表现出了他们丰富的智慧。离知子罗不远的怒江岸上，有大片肥沃的土地，属于普罗乡的四个氏族所有。过去种过庄稼，因没有水，庄稼不好，便改作牧场，二十年前，国民党的官吏霸占了这片土地，企图在附近的知子罗河上筑一座坝，拦住从雪山上流下来的河水灌溉这片荒地。官吏们在怒江两岸强派了几千民工，用鞭子威胁着他们把石头装在竹篓里沉下河去断流。但雪山并不向官吏们屈服，坝刚筑起，山上发了一阵大水，把石头连竹篓都冲跑了。工程整整进行了一年，把附近山上的竹子都砍光了，水坝始终没有筑成。当这片土地回到普罗乡人民的手中后，人们多么渴望引雪山的水来把它变成良田啊！但有前车之鉴，不敢贸然动手。去年大跃进中，一个贫苦傈僳农民的儿子，普罗乡党支部书记开山一提出一定要完成这件水利。好心的老人提醒他：“国民党时几千人都修不好，再修也是白费力气。”地主吓唬他说：“那条河里有鬼，谁碰着他就会发疯”。开山一却不管这些劝告和威胁，他坚定地告诉大家：“今天党派了干部领导我们，政府送了炮杆炸药来帮助我们，我们又办起了七个合作社，只要我们四个氏族一条心，雪山再高，也要它低头；河水再凶，也要它让路！”全乡的贫苦农民都拥护开山一的意见，不分那个氏族的人，都一起带上锅灶和工具，奔向工地。开山一和工作干部研究了过去国民党官吏失败的教训后，决定不采取筑坝断流的办法，而在知子罗河的上游开凿一条水渠，使河水从高处流向荒地。但是，水渠需要穿过雪山上的一座石壁，石壁有一里多长，高达二十丈，像刀劈斧削过似的屹立着。水渠如何能通过这座绝壁呢？当这个困难交给全乡群众讨论以后，有人提出了在石壁上插进一排铁杆，在上面架起木板涧槽，让水从涧槽里流过绝壁。但是，这座悬岩连猴子和岩羊都爬不上去，又怎能上去插铁杆呢？勇敢的傈僳青年约四首先用绳子拴住腰从岩顶上吊下去，在石壁上搭起一座便桥，人们一个接一个地走上悬在半空中的便桥去工作。水渠终于穿过了石壁。但前面又碰到一道深箐，渠水如何能飞过深箐呢？仍然用涧槽渡过去吧，箐有十多丈宽，搭这样长的涧槽，下面没有支柱是不行的。支柱吧，箐底又太深。这个问题又把大家难住了。开山一站在箐边整整琢磨了一天，他忽然想起过去到兰坪县运盐时，看见一条河上架着座人字桥。这个启示使他想出了：“用人字架支住涧槽，不是恰好吗？”大家按照他的意见，终于把涧槽架过了深箐。千难百折，都没有难倒傈僳人。两个月后，水渠全部完成了，怒江边上那片世世代代干渴的荒地变成了三百亩良田。
    上面的故事，不过是傈僳人千万件英雄事迹中的几朵浪花。千万朵细小的浪花汇成了澎湃的巨流；千万个普通傈僳人的力量使江山为之变色。去年一年中，傈僳人便在碧罗雪山和高黎贡山上开凿出了二千八百七十五条水渠，多少年来白白流入怒江的雪水驯服地流进了八万亩新开的梯田。
    时代变了，山河变了，人的心情也变了！
    现在，怒江两岸已经听不到那首哀怨的民歌了。傈僳人以征服大自然后的豪迈心情唱着新的民歌：
    “过去看天满天黑，
    看地一样色；
    现在看天星星多，
    看地水田多。”
    “团结力量大过山，
    山头一劈成两半；
    看上山顶汽车路；
    看去山坡金谷田。”雪山，在英雄的傈僳人面前低下了头！（附图片）
