New Year Couplets

	Welcoming the New Year, everyone thanks Chairman Mao
	Celebrating the harvest, everyone sings praises to the Communist Party
	With steel and grain, everything prospers
	Through hard work and practical effort, the motherland becomes rich and strong
	Cleanly and neatly sweep away the old year
	Joyfully and happily celebrate the New Year
		(Ling Xiao, Hua Wen)
