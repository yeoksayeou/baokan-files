Heroic Farewell
Ren Guilin, Li Lun, Ma Shaobo, Ajiaweng, Ou Hong, Screenwriters
Thirteenth scene of "The Battle of Red Cliffs"

(Huang Gai's camp. A boat moored by the river, lamplight dim; a bright moon in the sky, drums and horns silent. A junior officer, carrying a lantern and wine, leads Zhou Yu, in plain clothes, on.)
Zhou Yu: (Singing "Apricot Blossom Sky") The great river flows eastward, endless waves, depicting the boundless embrace of heroes. (To the junior officer)
     (Speaks) Quietly tell the old general that the Commander is here.
Junior Officer: Yes. (In a low voice) Old General, Old General, the Commander is here.
Huang Gai: (From within) Ah! (Enters, reciting) The bright moon illuminates the east, awaiting the favorable wind to break the waves! Unexpectedly to behold your heroic figure, (Looks around, seeing no one, hurries forward to see Zhou Yu, Zhou Yu takes Huang Gai's hand) Heroic spirit pierces the rainbow.
Zhou Yu: (Continuing the recitation) Cherish this body battle-worn, (Supporting Huang Gai's wounds) A cup of wine to send off the hero. (Raises wine)
     Light the fire and ride the wind, a star will fly into the sky.
Huang Gai: (Continuing the recitation) The raging torrent must be turned back, (Drinks) The Yi River departs calmly. Trample through a thousand layers of waves, capture the azure dragon with one hand.
Zhou Yu: Good! What a "capture the azure dragon with one hand." (In a low voice) Old General, are the fire ships fully prepared?
Huang Gai: Fully prepared.
Zhou Yu: Are the daring warriors properly selected and ready?
Huang Gai: Ready.
Zhou Yu: Is there no doubt about the correspondence of the surrender letter?
Huang Gai: Absolutely foolproof.
Zhou Yu: This Yu will take special care of the Old General's family.
Huang Gai: Thank you, Commander.
Zhou Yu: It's just that you, General...
Huang Gai: Ah! (Recites) Generously bid farewell to the homeland, entering the forest of knives with a smile. The rolling Yangtze River, will be stained with the red blood of heroes.
Zhou Yu: This will be hero's blood sprinkled red!
Huang Gai: (In a low voice) Commander! Can we rely on the east wind?
Zhou Yu: I expect it to be accurate.
Huang Gai: Are the men and horses fully prepared?
Zhou Yu: Arrayed and waiting, victory is in hand. Just waiting for the Old General to succeed with one burning!
Huang Gai: One burning to success!
Zhou Yu: One burning to success!
Huang Gai: Ah?
Zhou Yu: Ah.
Zhou Yu: Hahaha (Both laugh)
Huang Gai: Zhou Yu: Old General!
Huang Gai: This humble general is not old!
Zhou Yu: Not old?
Huang Gai: Not old!
Zhou Yu: (Holding Huang's beard) Alas, General, you are old!
     (Tearfully)
Huang Gai: (Also holding his own beard) Commander, look! Although this humble general is old, my heroic heart remains. I will not fail in this important task entrusted to me! (Kneels)
Zhou Yu: (Kneels) Old General! (Singing Er Liu)
     The vast righteousness soars into the sky, startling the stars to shine coldly!
     The raging waves increase in melodiousness, the wind and clouds also linger tenderly. (Both help each other up)
     Cherish this body that has gone through hundreds of battles, cherish the first ship sent off by the east wind.
     The great river awaits you to add burning coals, the Red Cliff awaits you to dye it with drunken colors.
     Don't say that the Great Wall is pushed to the north bank of the river, the Great Wall is on the old general's shoulders.
     May your pine and cypress bones withstand the cold of the year, may you talk and laugh as you go and return laughing.
Huang Gai: Commander! (Singing Yao Ban)
     Heroic ambition soars to the clouds, a white rainbow piercing the sky, what a magnificent farewell, Commander!
     For sixty years, my face has been covered with dust, and only today can I wash away the shame.
     What talk of starting a business and laying a foundation through hundreds of battles,
     (Turns to Allegro) What talk of galloping with carved saddles in the whale and crocodile formation. How can a true man be buried among weeds, growing old and dying in bed? I will learn to repay the country with a loyal heart and a horse-hide shroud! I regard the Yangtze River as a bolt of silk, casually unrolling it across the plain. The east wind rises, crashing into the warships, you should laugh at my gray hair as I take the lead. Fierce fire further aids the hero's courage, ensuring that the eighty-three thousand strong enemy are reduced to ashes, the flames reaching the sky! Gather the wind and thunder for dispatch, millions are insignificant, dealt with in jest.
Zhou Yu: Good! (Singing San Ban)
     A true man can change the universe, why begrudge the bleakness of the Yi River.
     A cup of wine is offered to embolden the brave tiger! (Offers wine to Huang Gai)
Huang Gai: (Receives wine) (Continuing San Ban) This cup of wine!
(Both strike a pose) Ah East Wind!
Zhou Yu:
Huang Gai: (Both sing together) Sweep away the clouds!
Zhou Yu: Take care!
Huang Gai: Thank you, Commander! (Curtain falls)

      举火乘风去，将星飞太空。黄盖：（接念）狂澜须倒挽，（饮）易水走从容。踏破千层浪，只手擒
      苍龙。周瑜：好啊！好一个只手擒苍龙。（低声）老将军火船具已齐备否？黄盖：具已齐备。周瑜：敢死壮士，指拨停当否？黄盖：停当了。周瑜：诈降书来往无疑否？黄盖：万无一失。周瑜：老将军的宝眷，瑜当加意照看。黄盖：多谢都督。周瑜：只是将军你……黄盖：哎呀！（念）慷慨辞故国，含笑入刀丛。滚滚长江水，英雄

      十年来尘扑面，今日才得洗汗颜。说什么创业开基经百战，
     （转快板）说什么鲸鲵阵里骋雕鞍。大丈夫岂能埋没蓬蒿老
      死床第间，学一个丹心报国马革裹尸还！我把长江当匹练，
      信手舒卷履平川。东风起，撞战船，应笑我白发苍苍着先鞭
      。烈火更助英雄胆，管教那八十三万强虏灰飞烟灭火烛天！
      收拾起风雷供调遣，百万一藐谈笑间。周瑜：好啊！（唱散板）大丈夫能把乾坤变，何惜萧萧易水寒。
