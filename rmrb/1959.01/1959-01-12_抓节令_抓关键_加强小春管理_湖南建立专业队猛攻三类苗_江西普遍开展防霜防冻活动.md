Xinhua News Agency report:
    Hunan is strengthening the field management of overwintering crops by establishing professional teams, grasping both ends to drive the middle, and vigorously attacking three types of fields. More than 30 million mu of overwintering crops across the province are growing well. Currently, rapeseed and wheat are full of lush greenery, generally emerging three to four inches high, with some high-yield fields of rapeseed already two feet high. At present, various localities are busy applying grass ash, pig and cattle manure, and other materials to rapeseed and other crops to prevent frost and freezing.

    Last winter, Hunan Province planted more than 30 million mu of crops that can be harvested this spring, an increase of about one-third compared to the winter planting area in 1957. Among them, rapeseed increased by nearly two times. Due to the drought in many places during planting last winter, coupled with the large planting area and insufficient fertilizer, some fields had uneven emergence. In the previous period, the three types of seedlings in the province's overwintering crops accounted for about 20% of the total planting area. Based on this situation, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China demanded that various localities vigorously attack the three types of seedlings to ensure large-scale yield increases, especially to strive for large-scale high yields of rapeseed. Subsequently, a mass movement to cultivate overwintering crops was launched throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Chen County prefectures, more than 20,000 Party committee secretaries and cadres at all levels and more than 850,000 people participated in the cultivation of overwintering crops.

    Another method for various localities to cultivate overwintering crops is to establish professional teams and implement a field management responsibility system. Many people's communes have promoted methods of assigning people, assigning fields, setting time limits, defining cultivation measures, and establishing evaluation and inspection systems, which has strengthened the effectiveness of field management.

Xinhua News Agency report:
    To strive for a bumper harvest on every winter seedling plot and high yields per mu, Jiangxi Province is universally carrying out mass frost and freeze prevention activities to protect overwintering crops from safely surviving the winter. Various localities have generally arranged for about 15% of the labor force to form management professional teams to process and cultivate overwintering crops. Currently, among the province's 26 million mu of overwintering crops, 60% have been weeded and fertilized once, and ditch drainage and straw covering and ash spreading have been carried out.

    This year, the winter crops planted in Jiangxi Province are generally growing neatly and vigorously. Some people in some areas, seeing the winter crops appearing green, once relaxed their efforts to strengthen fertilization and cultivation. In order to strive for a full and bumper harvest of winter crops, Party organizations at all levels have emphasized the need to make early preparations for frost and freeze prevention work for overwintering crops. The Jiangjia Township Party Committee in Xiajiang County specifically organized the entire township's labor force to launch a rush campaign to cover straw and fertilize. All 6,300 mu of winter crops in the township were universally covered with rice straw and applied with cattle manure and miscellaneous fertilizer. The Daqiao People's Commune in Jiujiang County deployed a campaign to seize time, seize the season, and do a good job of "one good" (good full seedlings and strong seedlings), "two clean" (weeding clean, apply all existing fertilizer), and "three preventions" (frost prevention, drought prevention, and livestock damage prevention), and adopted a system of division of labor and contract responsibility for cadres, weeding by female laborers, and fertilizer application by strong laborers, implementing a "three fix" (fixed time, fixed task, fixed quality) contract responsibility system. In order to protect winter seedlings from safely surviving the winter, Xiushui County also organized an army of 100,000 men and women to launch a winter seedling cultivation and management campaign centered on protecting and strengthening seedlings. More than 90% of the 200,000 mu of winter crops were covered with a layer of cattle manure and thatch. The 580,000 mu of safflower fields in Leping County were universally ditched for drainage, top-dressed with grass ash, pig and cattle manure, and covered with a layer of rice straw. Due to the prolonged drought, the drought situation for winter seedlings has not yet been completely alleviated in some areas, and these areas have also launched a drought resistance and seedling protection campaign. With the hard work of the broad masses, 60% to 75% of the more than 3 million mu of winter crops in Jiujiang Prefecture have been weeded and fertilized once. Currently, frost and freeze prevention work is still being carried out in various localities.

    While protecting winter seedlings from safely surviving the winter, various localities are also vigorously strengthening the field management of green manure. More than 630,000 mu of the 740,000 mu of green manure in Linchuan County have been ditched for drainage, and most of them have been top-dressed with fertilizer once or twice.

    抓节令　抓关键　加强小春管理
    湖南建立专业队猛攻三类苗
    江西普遍开展防霜防冻活动
    据新华社讯　湖南各地在加强越冬作物的田间管理工作中采取建立专业队，抓两头带中间的办法，猛攻三类田，全省三千多万亩越冬作物都生长良好。现在，油菜、麦子已满垅青葱，一般出土三、四寸高，有些高产田里的油菜已有两尺多高。目前各地正忙着给油菜等作物追施草木灰、猪牛粪等防霜防冻。
    湖南省去冬播种、今年春季能收割的作物有三千多万亩，较1957年冬播面积增加了约三分之一。其中油菜增加将近两倍。由于去冬播种时，很多地方天旱，加上播种面积大，肥料不足，因此有些田出苗不齐。前一个时期，全省越冬作物中三类苗约占总播种面积20％左右。中共湖南省委根据这一情况，要求各地猛攻三类苗，保证大面积增产，特别是要争取油菜大面积丰产。接着全省掀起了群众性的培育越冬作物的运动。据湘潭、邵阳、衡阳、郴县四个专区不完全统计，参加培育越冬作物的有各级党委书记和干部两万多人、群众八十五万多人。
    各地培育越冬作物的另一方法是建立专业队和田间管理责任制。很多人民公社推行了定人、定田、定时间、定培育措施、定评比检查的办法后，加强了田间管理的效果。
    据新华社讯　争取冬苗丘丘丰收，亩亩高产，江西省各地普遍开展群众性的防霜防冻活动，保护越冬作物安全过冬。各地一般都安排了15％左右的劳动力，组成管理专业队，加工培育越冬作物。目前全省二千六百多万亩越冬作物中，已有60％锄过一次草、追了一次肥，并且进行了开沟排水和盖草撒灰。
    今年，江西省播种的各项冬作物，一般都生长得整齐茁壮。部分地区有些群众看到冬作物呈现一片青绿，对于加强施肥培育曾一度放松。为了力争冬作物全苗丰收，各级党的组织都强调了要及早作好越冬作物的防霜防冻工作。峡江县江家乡乡党委特地组织全乡劳动力，开展了一个盖草施肥突击运动。全乡六千三百亩冬作物，田面上普遍盖上了稻草，并上了一次牛栏粪、杂肥。九江县大桥人民公社部署了一个争时间、抢季节，做好一好（全苗壮苗好）、二光（草锄光、现有肥上光）、三防（防霜、防旱、防畜害）运动，采取干部分工包干，女劳动力锄草，强劳动力挑粪追肥，实行三定（定时、定任务、定质量）的包干负责制度。修水县为了保护冬苗安全过冬，还组织了十万男女大军，掀起了一个以护苗、壮苗为中心的冬苗培育管理运动，二十多万亩冬作物，90％以上盖上了一层牛栏粪和茅草。乐平县五十八万亩红花田，普遍进行了开沟排水，追施了草木灰、猪牛栏粪，并且盖了一层稻草。由于久旱不雨，部分地区目前冬苗仍未完全解除旱象，这些地区还展开了抗旱保苗运动。在广大群众的辛勤培育下，九江专区三百多万亩冬作物，目前已有60％到75％锄了一次草，追了一次肥。目前防霜防冻工作还在各地深入开展。
    在保护冬苗安全过冬的同时，各地还大力加强绿肥的田间管理。临川县七十四万多亩绿肥，已经有六十三万多亩进行了开沟排水，其中大部分追施了一次到两次肥料。
