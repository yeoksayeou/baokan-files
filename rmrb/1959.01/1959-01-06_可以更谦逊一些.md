    Can Be More Humble
    1958 was the year of the Great Leap Forward in socialism. During this year, our socialist construction achieved brilliant accomplishments. Many creative deeds emerged on all fronts, including the cultural front. The "History of Chinese Literature" compiled by the Class of 1955 students majoring in literature from the Chinese Department of Peking University attracted much attention. Based on the criticism of bourgeois academic thought, these third-year young students, recognizing the harm of bourgeois academic thought, and under the proposal and leadership of the Peking University Party Committee, resolved to compile a history of the two to three thousand years of Chinese literary development using Marxist viewpoints for analysis and summarization. This aspiration was well-established; it was an aspiration of socialism, an aspiration of the daring, speaking, and doing proletariat. Supported by this aspiration, and after more than a month of hard work, these young students, these new cultural warriors who grew up under the cultivation of the Communist Party, relying on the Party's care and leadership, and on the collective hard work and wisdom, wrote such a literary history. Moreover, its content indeed has a considerable level, at least it is the first attempt to truly explain literary historical phenomena using Marxist viewpoints, and in this regard, it far exceeds the achievements of predecessors. This is a huge victory, a victory for the invincible Marxist ideology.
    As a literary enthusiast and a student of literature, I have deep respect for these new Marxist warriors on the literary front. I also feel that it is a great pity that this literary history has been published for three or four months, and our literary critics have not yet written comprehensive reviews.
    However, when I read the "Preface" and "Postscript" of this literary history, I always feel uncomfortable. Especially when I see such sentences: "In 1956, the Ministry of Higher Education entrusted some experts to compile a literary history, gave them assistants, and gave them superior working and living conditions, but two whole years have passed, and the literary history is nowhere to be seen." The entire "Preface" and "Postscript" exude an air of arrogance and boastfulness. I believe that Marxists, no matter how great their achievements, should always be humble. Because we have dedicated our entire lives to the great cause, and doing as much as we do is what we should do. Moreover, compared to the creation of the workers and peasants, our work is insignificant. Furthermore, Marxists never obliterate the work of predecessors. Specifically speaking, if this literary history did not draw on the existing literary histories written by many predecessors, and started completely from scratch, it would probably encounter many difficulties. In my opinion, this literary history, whether in terms of style, viewpoint, or even the evaluation of specific writers and works, has drawn on several other literary histories. And the authors of these literary histories are mostly still alive, and some of them may be the very subjects of criticism in this literary history. Although their thoughts may contain serious bourgeois viewpoints, if their work still has some benefit to the revolution, we should not obliterate it. Otherwise, the so-called "we have inherited the research results of our predecessors and accepted all their correct and valuable opinions" will become abstract empty talk.
    Marxists not only adopt a scientific attitude when studying knowledge, but should adopt a scientific attitude towards all issues. Humility is a virtue of revolutionaries. I think the "Preface" and "Postscript" of the "History of Chinese Literature" compiled by Peking University students could be written more humbly. Zhao Mingyuan

    可以更谦逊一些
    1958年，是伟大的社会主义大跃进的一年。在这一年中间，我们的社会主义建设取得了辉煌的成就。在各个战线上出现了不少创造性的事迹，文化战线上也是如此。北京大学中文系文学专门化五五级的同学编著的“中国文学史”，引起了很大注意。在资产阶级学术思想批判的基础上，这些三年级的年轻的同学，鉴于资产阶级学术思想的祸害人，在北大的校党委的倡议和领导下，立定志气要编著一部用马克思主义观点分析和总结我国两三千年文学发展的历史。这志气立得好，立的是社会主义志气，立的是敢想敢说敢干的无产阶级的志气。就是在这种志气的支持下，经过一个多月的苦战，这些年轻的同学，这些在共产党培养下长大起来的新的文化战士，凭着党的关怀和领导，凭着集体的艰苦劳动和智慧，把这样一部文学史写出来了。而且它的内容也确实有相当的水平，至少是第一次真正运用马克思主义观点解释文学历史现象的尝试，在这一点上，它远远地超出了前人的成就。这是一个巨大的胜利，这是战无不胜的马克思主义思想的胜利。
    作为一个文艺爱好者，也是学文学的人，我对这些文艺战线上的马克思主义的新战士，怀着深深的敬意。也感觉到，这部文学史已经出版了三、四个月了，我们的文学批评家还没有写出全面性的评论文章，是一件非常遗憾的事。
    但是，当我阅读这部文学史的“前言”和“后记”的时候，总有一种不舒服的感觉。尤其是看到这样一些句子：“1956年高教部委托一些专家编文学史，给他们助手，给他们优越的工作和生活条件，可是，整整两年过去了，文学史却杳无影踪”。整个“前言”和“后记”，都存在着一种盛气凌人、夸耀成绩的气氛。我以为，马克思主义者不管有多大成就，总应该是谦虚的。因为我们是把整个生命都贡献给伟大的事业了，做多少事也是应该做的。何况比起工农大众的创造来，我们的工作不过是微乎其微的。而且马克思主义者也绝不抹杀前人的工作。具体一点说，这部文学史如果不借鉴现存的许多前人写的文学史，完全是另起炉灶，恐怕会遇到很多困难。据我看，这部文学史无论是体例、观点以至于对具体作家作品的评价，对其他几部文学史都有所借鉴。而这些文学史的作者，大部分还都活着，有的人也许就是这本文学史的批评对象。尽管他们的思想有些可能是存在着严重的资产阶级观点，但如果他们的工作，还有一部分对革命有益，我们也不应该抹杀。否则，所谓“我们继承了前人的研究成果，接受了他们的一切正确的有价值的意见，就成了抽象的空谈了。
    马克思主义者不仅是在研究学问的时候，采取科学的态度，对待一切问题都应该采取科学的态度。谦逊，是革命者的美德。我觉得北大同学编著“中国文学史”的“前言”和“后记”，可以写得更谦逊一些。　赵明元
