What is motor vehicle train operation?

Motor vehicle train operation is the hauling of trailers by motor vehicles. A motor vehicle hauling one, two, or more trailers is called a motor vehicle train. The exact number of trailers and the amount of weight that a motor vehicle can haul depends on many factors, such as road conditions, the technical performance of the main vehicle, the quality of the trailers, and so on. For example, on some trunk lines and dedicated mine lines, where road and bridge conditions are good and the tractive power of the vehicles is high, the practice of hauling multiple trailers has been implemented, which has a significant effect on improving the efficiency of motor vehicle transportation and reducing costs.

    什么叫汽车列车化？
    汽车列车化就是汽车拖挂运输。一辆汽车拖带一辆、二辆，或更多辆挂车，就称为汽车列车化。一辆汽车究竟拖带多少辆挂车和多少重量适宜，取决于很多因素：如道路情况，主车的技术性能，挂车的质量等等。例如有些干线和矿区专用线，道路和桥梁的条件好、汽车牵引力大，已实行了多辆挂车的拖挂运输，对提高汽车运输效率，降低成本都有显著效果。
