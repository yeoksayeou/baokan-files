Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a grand gathering this morning to warmly welcome General Lázaro Cárdenas, former President of Mexico and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, and the Mexican guests accompanying him.

CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen and General Cárdenas spoke at the meeting successively (full text on page 2). Peng Zhen emphasized, "The Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the people of Cuba, Latin America, Asia, and Africa against imperialism and to defend national independence and freedom, and firmly believe that their just struggle will achieve final victory." General Cárdenas pointed out in his speech, "We believe that only peaceful coexistence can open the way for the progress of all mankind." He also emphasized, "Disputes that make the people of all countries uneasy must be resolved through peaceful means, not war."

The grand reception was held in the CPPCC Auditorium. At 10:10 AM, General Cárdenas, accompanied by CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairmen Peng Zhen, Shen Junru, and Huang Yanpei, China Peace Committee Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Liao Chengzhi, and CPPCC National Committee Secretary-General Xing Xiping, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the more than 1,400 participants in the reception applauded warmly for a long time, expressing their warmest welcome to the distinguished guests from Mexico.

CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen said in his speech that Mr. Cárdenas is not only an outstanding Mexican political activist but also an outstanding fighter for the defense of world peace. The Chinese people have always given a high evaluation of Mr. Cárdenas's activities and achievements.

Peng Zhen said, "Our era is an era of constantly growing peace forces and a vigorous development of national independence movements. In the past year, the people of Latin American countries have achieved a series of victories in their struggle against U.S. imperialist interference and plunder, in their struggle to defend national resources and develop national economies, and in their struggle against dictatorial regimes that sell out national interests. Not long ago, the Batista regime, which colluded with U.S. aggressors and rode roughshod over the Cuban people, collapsed under the Cuban people's anti-dictatorial struggle and the victorious offensive of the rebel army. This is another great victory for the Cuban people and the Latin American people. The imperialists are not reconciled to their failure in Cuba. They are doing everything possible to deprive the Cuban people of the right to sanction counter-revolutionary war criminals and endanger the Cuban people's cause of national independence. This is a blatant act of imperialist interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The Chinese people know from their own personal experience that the imperialists are barbaric and greedy, but they are also bullying the weak and fearing the strong. As long as the people of all countries unite and persist in their struggle, imperialist aggression and interference can be completely defeated."

Peng Zhen said that the Chinese people and the people of Latin American countries have common demands and interests in various just struggles against imperialist aggression, for the attainment and upholding of national independence, and for the preservation of world peace. Precisely because of this reason, the Chinese people regard the struggles of the Latin American people as their own struggles, the victories of the Latin American people as their own victories, and consider every achievement of the Latin American people as a strong support and encouragement to themselves.

Peng Zhen concluded by saying that Mr. Cárdenas's visit to China with his Mexican friends will undoubtedly further enhance mutual understanding and the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Mexican people.

The venue welcomed General Cárdenas's speech with thunderous applause. When he paid tribute to the Chinese people, thunderous applause rang out again in the venue. General Cárdenas said:

"Although Mexico and China are far apart, deep feelings have existed between the people of our two countries for centuries." He said, "We launched great struggles against domestic and foreign forces that hinder the progress of the people almost simultaneously. Suffocating feudalism and foreign armed interference have been huge obstacles to our development in both Mexico and China. Fortunately, the people of all countries are tireless, and the people of our two countries have never stopped their struggle for the historical goals of freedom and social justice."

He said, "The people of Latin America, like the people of the United States, do not want war. The people of Europe are the same. Today, we clearly see that the Chinese people, as well as the Soviet Union and other socialist countries we have visited, are also opposed to war."

General Cárdenas concluded by saying, "This visit to China has convinced us that this great country is engaged in the most significant event in its history, striving to pass on the legacy of morality and social justice to future generations. Therefore, I am convinced that China is a supporter of peace."

General Cárdenas's speech was constantly interrupted by the prolonged applause of the audience. When he finished speaking, everyone stood up, applauding enthusiastically to thank him for his sincere and friendly speech.

The more than 1,400 participants in the welcoming meeting included CPPCC members in Beijing and people from all walks of life in the capital. Latin American peace activists in Beijing also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a reception at noon today to welcome all the Mexican friends headed by General Lázaro Cárdenas, former President of Mexico and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council.

CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairmen Peng Zhen, Shen Junru, and Huang Yanpei, China Peace Committee Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Liao Chengzhi, and CPPCC National Committee Secretary-General Xing Xiping attended the reception. At the reception, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen and others introduced General Cárdenas to meet with famous figures from various fields in our country, and the guests and hosts shook hands and talked cordially.

Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen raised a glass to congratulate Mexico on its national prosperity and the happiness of its people, and to wish all the distinguished Mexican guests good health, and to congratulate the friendship between the Chinese and Mexican people and world peace. General Cárdenas also raised a glass to wish the Chinese people happiness and national progress.

The reception, which was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, lasted for an hour. (Attached picture)

    彭真在政协欢迎墨西哥贵宾大会上表示中国人民的心意
    全力支持古巴和拉丁美洲的正义斗争
    卡德纳斯说只有和平共处才能为人类进步开辟道路
    据新华社22日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天上午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎墨西哥前总统、世界和平理事会副主席卡德纳斯将军和随他同来的墨西哥贵宾们。
    政协全国委员会彭真副主席和卡德纳斯将军先后在会上讲了话。（全文见第二版）。彭真强调指出：“中国人民全力支持古巴和拉丁美洲、亚洲、非洲各国人民反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和自由的正义斗争，并且深信他们的正义斗争一定会取得最后胜利。”卡德纳斯将军在讲话中指出：“我们认为，只有和平共处才能为全人类的进步开辟道路。”并且强调说：“必须通过和平而不是战争的道路来解决使各国人民感到不安的争端。”
    这个盛大的欢迎会是在政协礼堂举行的。十时十分，卡德纳斯将军由政协全国委员会副主席彭真、沈钧儒、黄炎培，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席廖承志，政协全国委员会秘书长邢西萍陪同登上主席台。这时候，参加欢迎会的一千四百多人长时间地热烈鼓掌，向远道而来的墨西哥贵宾表示最热情的欢迎。
    政协全国委员会副主席彭真在讲话中说，卡德纳斯先生不仅是墨西哥杰出的政治活动家，同时也是保卫世界和平的卓越战士，中国人民对于卡德纳斯先生的活动和成就，一向给予很高的评价。
    彭真说：“我们的时代是和平力量不断壮大的时代，是民族独立运动蓬勃发展的时代。在过去的一年内，拉丁美洲各国人民在反对美国帝国主义干涉和掠夺的斗争中，在保卫民族资源、发展民族经济的斗争中，在反对出卖民族利益的独裁政权的斗争中，取得了一系列的胜利。不久以前，勾结美国侵略者骑在古巴人民头上的巴蒂斯塔政权，在古巴人民反独裁斗争和起义军节节胜利的进攻下垮台了。这是古巴人民、也是拉丁美洲人民的又一个伟大胜利。帝国主义者是不甘心他们在古巴的失败的，他们正在千方百计地企图剥夺古巴人民制裁反革命战犯的权利，危害古巴人民的民族独立事业，这是明目张胆地干涉古巴内政的帝国主义行为。中国人民从自己的切身经验中知道，帝国主义者是野蛮和贪得无厌的，但又是欺软怕硬的。只要各国人民团结一致坚持斗争，帝国主义的侵略和干涉是完全可以打败的。”
    彭真说，中国人民和拉丁美洲各国人民之间，在反对帝国主义侵略，争取和维护民族独立和保卫世界和平等各种正义斗争中，有着共同的要求和利害关系。正是因为这个缘故，中国人民把拉丁美洲人民的斗争看成自己的斗争，把拉丁美洲人民的胜利看成自己的胜利，并认为拉丁美洲人民的每一个成就都是对自己的有力支持和鼓舞。
    彭真最后说，卡德纳斯先生和墨西哥朋友们这次访问中国，无疑会进一步增进中墨两国人民间的相互了解和友好关系的发展。
    会场以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎卡德纳斯将军讲话。当他向中国人民致意的时候，会场上又一次响起了春雷般的掌声。卡德纳斯将军说：
  “虽然墨西哥和中国相距遥远，但是多少世纪以来我们两国人民之间就存在着深厚的感情。”他说：“我们几乎同时展开了反对那些阻挠人民进步的国内外势力的伟大斗争。窒息一切的封建主义以及外国武装干涉无论在墨西哥和中国都曾经是我们发展的巨大障碍。幸好各国人民不知疲倦，我们两国人民没有停止过他们争取自由和社会正义的历史目标的斗争。”
    他说：“拉丁美洲人民就像美国人民一样不要战争。欧洲人民也是如此。今天，我们清楚地看到，中国人民以及我们访问过的苏联和其他社会主义制度的国家也都反对战争。”
    卡德纳斯将军最后说：“这次访问中国使我们相信，这个伟大的国家正在从事着它的历史上最重大的事件，它努力把道德和社会正义的遗产传给子孙。因此，我确信，中国是拥护和平的。”
    卡德纳斯将军的讲话，不断被全场持久不息的掌声打断。当他讲话结束时，人们全体起立。热烈鼓掌，感谢他那诚挚、友谊的讲话。
    参加欢迎大会的一千四百多人中，包括在北京的政协委员和首都各界人民，在北京的拉丁美洲和平人士也出席了大会。
    新华社22日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天中午举行酒会，欢迎以墨西哥前总统、世界和平理事会副主席拉萨罗·卡德纳斯将军为首的全体墨西哥朋友。
    政协全国委员会副主席彭真、沈钧儒、黄炎培，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席廖承志，政协全国委员会秘书长邢西萍等出席了酒会。在酒会上，彭真副主席等介绍卡德纳斯将军同我国各方面的著名人士见面，宾主双方亲切地握手交谈。
    彭真副主席举杯祝贺墨西哥国家富强、人民幸福和全体墨西哥贵宾身体健康，祝贺中墨两国人民的友谊和世界和平。卡德纳斯将军也举杯祝中国人民幸福和国家进步。
    充满热烈友好气氛的酒会共进行了一个小时。（附图片）
