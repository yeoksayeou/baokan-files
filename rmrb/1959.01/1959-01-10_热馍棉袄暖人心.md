Concern for the Masses' Livelihood

    Hot Steamed Buns and Cotton-padded Coats Warm Hearts
    The northwest wind was blowing hard, and snowflakes were fluttering in the sky, not stopping even at noon. Comrade Yin Liren, the cook at our mining institute, had already prepared lunch and was getting ready to send it to the mining site. At that moment, he thought: The weather is so cold, and the West Gully mining site is more than two miles away. The food will be cold by the time it's carried to the site. The Party has repeatedly called on us to care for the lives of the workers and improve their food. How can we let the comrades eat cold food on such a cold day? So, he first laid a layer of wheat straw in the food basket, then put on a hot steaming cloth, placed the steamed buns on it, and then covered it with another layer of hot steaming cloth, a layer of wheat straw, and finally put a large iron pot on top. When he had prepared the food and was about to carry it to the site, he thought that if it felt this cold at home, the comrades with thin clothes must be even colder at the site. So, he took his own cotton-padded coats and those of the comrades at home and carried them all with him.
    At the site, the workers ate the hot steamed buns and some put on the cotton-padded coats that Old Yin had brought. Everyone thanked him for his spirit of serving the masses with such enthusiasm.

    热馍棉袄暖人心
    西北风刮得很紧，天空雪花飘飘，到中午还不停。我们采矿所的炊事员尹利仁同志已把午饭做好，准备送到采矿工地去。这时，他想：天气这样冷，西沟采矿工地又在五里以外，把饭挑到工地就冷了。党一再号召我们关心职工生活，把伙食办好，这大冷天怎能叫同志们吃冷饭呢？他于是先在饭筐里铺一层小麦秸，再把出笼的热蒸布铺上，放上蒸馍，然后再盖上一层热蒸布、一层麦秸，再在上面盖一口大铁锅。当他把饭挑准备好要挑往工地时，又想到这天气在家里都感觉冷，那些衣服单薄的同志在工地上更冷，他就把自己和在家里的同志的几件棉袄一起挑去了。
    在工地上，工人们吃着热蒸馍，有的穿上老尹带来的棉袄，大家都感谢他这种热情为群众服务的精神。
