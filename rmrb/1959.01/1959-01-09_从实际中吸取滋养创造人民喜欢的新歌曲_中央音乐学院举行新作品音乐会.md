Drawing Nourishment from Reality to Create New Songs the People Love
Central Conservatory of Music Holds New Works Concert

    (Our report) The Central Conservatory of Music recently held a concert of new works. Among the pieces performed, the "Youth Piano Concerto," the orchestral "Gada Meilin Symphonic Poem," and the "People's Commune Chorus" stirred the hearts of the audience. These excellent works are all creations of young students at the conservatory, and also represent a portion of the achievements made by the faculty and students of the conservatory in implementing the Party's educational policy of combining education with productive labor, and in conjunction with teaching reform.
    The "Youth Piano Concerto" takes folk songs as its theme and develops them based on the characteristics of piano composition and performance techniques, creating a strong national flavor. Another important feature is its innovation in composition and performance form, using a national orchestra for accompaniment. When Liu Shikun, a second-year student in the piano department and a young pianist, performed this work, he combined it with the accompaniment of the national orchestra almost seamlessly. He made the piano, which was once thought to have nothing in common with national musical instruments, produce new timbres with a strong national character, reflecting the vigorous spirit, optimistic mood, and love for the motherland and faith in the victory of the socialist revolution of the young people of New China. People found familiar musical language and intimate emotions in the sonorous piano sounds. Liu Shikun is also one of the four young authors of this work. He and his collaborators, Huang Xiaofei, Pan Yiming, and Sun Yilin, have undergone significant changes in their thoughts and feelings through labor training and contact with workers and peasants, and their political enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. In order to enable the piano to reflect the new ideological feelings of the people, to closely serve the masses, to be understood by the masses, and to be loved by the masses, they broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, boldly broke through conventions, and gave full play to the creativity of young people. They created this work, which is considered a precedent for the nationalization of piano performance, in less than half a month. It is also relatively complex and rich in changes in its compositional techniques. Therefore, Liu Shikun's performance skills have also achieved new achievements through the performance of this work.
    The "Gada Meilin Symphonic Poem" is a heroic ode. With rich musical language, it recounts the revolutionary history of the national hero of Inner Mongolia leading the people to resist the rule of feudal princes. At the beginning, it uses familiar, broad, and poetic music to bring people's thoughts and feelings to the beautiful Inner Mongolian grasslands, arousing people's yearning for the grasslands. Then, it uses complex musical melodies and rhythms to describe the rule of the brutal princes and the resistance and sacrifice of the people. This symphonic poem has thought and image, but it is also simple. It expresses the people's hatred for feudal rulers, and also expresses the people's admiration and respect for heroes. The author, Xin Huguang, is a graduate of this academy. This is her graduation work.
    Xiang Yin, Lu Haolin, Lin Shuan, Xu Yuan, and other graduating students of the composition department, collectively created the "People's Commune Chorus" under the guidance of teachers. Both its ideological content and musical melodies forcefully reflect the surging momentum and enormous power of the People's Commune movement under the leadership of the Party, and also reflect the tense yet happy labor and happy life of the commune members in all aspects. When Xiang Yin and others created this work, they ate, lived, worked, and laughed with the commune members in the commune. Therefore, this chorus more realistically expresses the thoughts and feelings of the commune members.
    Now, the faculty and students of the academy are widely soliciting opinions from all parties on these works in order to continue to revise and process them, so that they can become more perfect works and be presented to the people of the motherland as gifts for the tenth anniversary of National Day this year.

    从实际中吸取滋养创造人民喜欢的新歌曲
    中央音乐学院举行新作品音乐会
    本报讯　中央音乐学院最近举行了一次新作品音乐会。在演奏的节目中，“青年钢琴协奏曲”、管弦乐“嘎达梅林交响诗”、“人民公社大合唱”等新作品，激动了听众们的心。这些优秀作品，都是这个学院的青年学生的创作，也是这个学院师生在贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针中，结合教学改革所获得的成绩的一部分。
    “青年钢琴协奏曲”以民歌为主题、根据钢琴创作和演奏技巧的特点加以发挥，富有浓厚的民族色彩。它的另一个重要特点是在创作和演奏形式上有所创造，以民族管弦乐队伴奏。钢琴系二年级学生、青年钢琴家刘诗昆在演奏这个作品时，与民族乐队的伴奏结合，几乎达到水乳相融的程度。他使一向认为和民族乐器毫无共同之处的钢琴，发出了民族色彩浓郁的新音调，反映出新中国青年的蓬勃朝气、乐观情绪，以及他们对祖国的热爱和对社会主义革命胜利的信念。人们从铿锵的钢琴声中，找到了自己熟悉的音乐语言和亲切的感情。刘诗昆又是这个作品的四个青年作者之一。他和他的合作者黄晓飞、潘一明、孙亦林等，在劳动锻炼和与工农群众接触中，思想感情有了显著的变化，政治热情空前饱满。为了使钢琴也能反映人民新的思想感情，使钢琴也能密切为群众服务，为群众理解，为群众所喜爱，他们破除迷信，解放思想，大胆突破了陈规，发挥了青年人的创造性，在前后不到半个月的时间内，创作了这部被认为是钢琴演奏民族化的先例的作品。它在创作手法上也是比较复杂和有着丰富的变化的。因此刘诗昆的演奏技巧，通过这一作品的演奏，也获得了新的成就。
    “嘎达梅林交响诗”是一部英雄的颂歌。它以丰富的音乐语言，记述了内蒙古民族英雄领导人民反抗封建王爷统治的革命历史。它一开始就以大家熟悉的辽阔而富于诗意的音乐把人们的思想感情带到了美丽的内蒙古草原，激起了人们对草原的向往。接着它以复杂的音乐旋律和节奏，描写了残暴的王爷的统治及人民的反抗和牺牲。这部交响诗有思想、有形象、但又朴实，它表达了人民对封建统治者的仇恨，也表达了人民对英雄的赞美和敬爱。作者辛沪光是这个学院的毕业生。这是她的毕业作品。
    作曲系毕业班学生向音、陆浩林、林树安、徐源等，在教师指导下，集体创作的“人民公社大合唱”，不论思想内容和音乐旋律，都比较有力地反映了在党的领导下，人民公社运动的澎湃气势和巨大力量，也从各方面反映了公社社员们紧张而又愉快的劳动和幸福生活的情景。向音等在创作这一作品时，曾在公社与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同欢笑。因此这个大合唱比较真实地表达了公社社员们的思想感情。
    现在，这个学院的师生正广泛征求各方面对这些作品的意见，以便继续修改、加工，使它们成为更完善的作品，作为今年国庆十周年向祖国人民的献礼。
