Flowers Bloom and Herdsmen Sing
——A Visit to the First People's Commune in a Pastoral Area of Inner Mongolia
By Our Correspondent Mì Jí Dé Dào ěr Jī

    The people's commune is a flower,
    Chairman Mao cultivated it with his own hands;
    Flowers bloom and herdsmen sing,
    Pastoral construction shines brightly.

The Mongolian herdsmen of the Shangdu Guole Grassland in the Zhenglan Banner of Inner Mongolia use this folk song to praise their people's commune. This is because the organizational form of the people's commune brought many changes to the grassland as soon as it appeared, proving that it is not only suitable for agricultural areas, but also for the needs of socialist construction in pastoral areas.

Not long ago, I, the reporter, arrived at the Shangdu Guole Grassland. As the car drove into this winter pasture, a brand-new grassland scene appeared before us. Flocks of cattle and sheep were scattered on both sides of an icy river. Along the south bank of the river were rows of white houses, interspersed with some yurts, reflecting particularly white in the sunlight. In the middle of the pastoral village, there was a straight two-li road, with new buildings for shops, schools, and hospitals on both sides. The north wind made the wires along the road hum, and the telephone extended from here to the depths of the grassland. This is the central area of the Shangdu Guole People's Commune, a new type of "pastoral city."

The Golden Key

Comrade Bayasguleng, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, is a very optimistic young herdsman. He enthusiastically introduced the birth of the commune to me:

On this grassland, which was called the "three many's" grassland before liberation—"many poor people, many diseases, and many illiterate people"—major changes have taken place in recent years under the deep concern of the Party and in the continuous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The number of livestock has increased five and a half times compared with the time of liberation. Hospitals and health stations have also appeared on the grassland, and young men and women have become literate. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward last year, there have been electric lights and telephones on this grassland. The herdsmen are extremely happy and are even more eager to accelerate production and construction on the grassland. But everyone often felt that their shoulders were not strong enough. Some had too many livestock and not enough pasture; some wanted to eliminate waterless grasslands but felt there were too few people; some wanted to run factories, but funds became a problem… In short, "small shoulders can't carry heavy burdens." Small cooperatives meant weak manpower and material resources, which could not adapt to the ever-growing needs of livestock production. What to do? Just as the herdsmen were discussing this, the news that Chairman Mao said "People's communes are good" reached here, like the dawn at daybreak, illuminating the hearts of the herdsmen once again. On this vast pasture, cheers erupted everywhere: Found it, found it, Chairman Mao has given us the "golden key" again! Thus, the first people's commune on the Inner Mongolian grassland—the Shangdu Guole People's Commune—was born.

Thousands of Changes

This commune was formed by merging fourteen small pastoral cooperatives. The whole commune has six hundred and eighty-seven herdsmen households and more than twenty-six thousand livestock. Now, the commune has been established for less than five months, but in the words of the Mongolian members themselves, the pasture has undergone thousands of changes.

In the snow-covered pasture, I, the reporter, made a tour. The herdsmen all looked radiant and energetic, grazing the commune's flocks of livestock. The whole commune has more than eighty groups of horses, cattle, and sheep. I came across twenty or thirty groups in the pasture, and the livestock were all plump and fat. The members said this was a miracle. Indeed, in previous years, livestock always lost weight in winter, and the best management could only maintain the autumn fat. After the establishment of this commune, the boundaries of the original small cooperatives were broken, the pastures were used in a unified way, and the most outstanding herdsmen were selected to graze the livestock, and the livestock gained weight. Some curious herdsmen selected a batch of sheep of upper, middle and lower grades and weighed them to test their fatness: since the beginning of winter, each ewe has gained an average of more than three jin of meat. In order to ensure that the livestock safely passed the snow season, the commune also stored more than 14 million jin of green grass, more than twice as much as in the small cooperative period.

In one residential area, I heard a group of old herdsmen talking with relish about the story of the "medical team." After listening carefully, I realized that it was about the problem of sheep breeding. One of the old herdsmen said: "For many years, the most troublesome thing for us herdsmen has been the low conception rate of female animals. Now the commune has solved it for us."

The matter is like this. After the establishment of the commune, a group of inseminators were trained. They were preparing to implement artificial insemination of female animals, but some old herdsmen became worried: the conception rate is already low with natural mating, wouldn't artificial insemination be even worse? Some even thought that artificial insemination was an "indecent" thing. The Party committee of the commune gave the old people patient explanations and then carried out the work. A month, two months passed quickly, and the bellies of the female animals grew bigger day by day. After the insemination personnel checked, all of the more than 5,800 ewes in the commune were pregnant, and more than 97% of the adult ewes of the right age were also pregnant, more than double the previous number. At this time, those old herdsmen were really happy. When they talked about this, they said: "The commune has brought us new technology. We were worried about it before."

In the pasture, I met many young men and women, working together in groups. Sometimes they rode horses to other pastures to work. They called themselves the shock brigade for building the grassland. There were more than 300 young men and women. Wherever there was construction on the pasture, they went there. The older generation of herdsmen called them "good commune members." After the birth of the shock brigade, they built a new mechanical water supply station on a pasture that had been without water for many years. It can meet the drinking needs of 10,000 livestock every day. Then, they dug many wells on the pasture and also opened mountains to find springs. The arid grassland now has water everywhere.

In previous years, the grain and fodder needed on this grassland were supplied from other places, which brought many difficulties to the high-speed development of animal husbandry. After the establishment of the commune, there were more people and greater strength, and the herdsmen proposed to change this situation. At this time, the shock brigade members specially organized a feed production team, which reclaimed and autumn-plowed more than 5,000 mu of land in the late autumn season last year. They deep-plowed more than two chi of some of it and applied 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. This year, the commune can completely self-supply grain and feed. Because the commune has abundant funds, it has also bought two tractors and more than ten raking machines. The work of feed production and raking is moving towards the goal of mechanization.

In the central area of the commune, I also visited the commune's iron and wood, wool, carpet, boot, and food factories. Building factories in pastoral areas was often regarded as something for the distant future in the past. But with communization, there was more money and more talent. They made do with whatever was available and quickly set up these factories. Now, these small processing plants have produced a batch of cold-proof felt boots, Mongolian boots, and pastries to support the cities and supply the needs of the members.

In each residential area, the commune has also established a large number of collective welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups. More than 450 housewives are now happily participating in various labor activities of the commune, and they also have the opportunity to learn culture and various skills.

Greatly Promote Cultural Revolution

Speaking of culture and technology, here it is really "one night of spring rain, a garden of flowers blooming." A new team of herdsmen who can both graze, farm, and treat livestock diseases is growing and strengthening here. I saw that in each residential area, there were branch schools of the herdsmen's political, cultural, and technical spare-time schools. In the central area, there were a general school and a semi-pastoral and semi-study middle school, a ten-year middle school, with a total of more than 1,500 students. In the evening, groups of male and female herdsmen, talking and laughing, with books in their arms, went to these schools to learn various technologies and continue to improve their cultural level. There is also a scientific research office in the central area. The comrades of the commune told me that there are often some old herdsmen and young men and women herdsmen studying and discussing scientific knowledge in animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and feed production. In addition, there is a Party school, with more than 50 Party members studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works.

At the end of the visit, I thought for a long time: how lovely the grassland has become today!

    鲜花盛开牧人唱
    ——内蒙古第一个牧区人民公社访问记
    本报记者　密吉德道尔基
    人民公社是枝花，　毛主席亲手栽培它，
    鲜花盛开牧人唱，　牧区建设放光芒。
    内蒙古正兰旗上都郭勒草原蒙古族牧民，用这首民歌来歌颂他们的人民公社。这是因为人民公社这种组织形式刚一出现，就给草原带来了许多变化，证明了它不仅适合于农业区，而且也适合于畜牧区社会主义建设的需要。
    不久前，记者到了上都郭勒草原。汽车一驶进这冬天的牧场，迎面出现了一幅崭新的草原景色。一条冰河两岸，散布着群群的牛羊。沿着河南岸，是一幢幢白色房屋，夹杂一些蒙古包，在阳光下映得格外洁白。牧村中间，有条两华里的笔直马路，两旁还有一些商店、学校和医院的新建筑物。北风吹得路旁的电线嗡嗡响，电话从这里又伸向了草原深处。这里就是上都郭勒人民公社的中心区，一个新型“牧业城”。
    金钥匙
    公社党委书记巴雅斯古楞同志，是位很乐观的青年牧人。他向记者热情地介绍了公社诞生的经过：
    在这个解放前被人们称为“穷人多，疾病多，文盲多”的“三多”草原上，近几年来在党的深切关怀下和互助合作运动的不断发展过程中，发生了重大的变化。牲畜比解放时增加了五倍半，牧场上还出现了医院、保健站，男女青壮年都变成了有文化的人。特别是去年大跃进以来，这个草原上又有了电灯、电话，牧民们可高兴极了，他们更是一个劲儿地要求加速草原上的生产建设。但是大家又往往觉得自己的肩膀还不够强硬，有的牲畜多了，牧场不够用了；有的想消灭无水草原，又感到人手太少；有的想办工厂，资金又成了问题……。总之，“小肩膀不好担大担子”，社小，人力、物力单薄，不能适应牧业生产日益发展的需要。怎么办呢？牧民们正纷纷议论的时候，毛主席说“人民公社好”的消息传到了这里，像黎明时曙光一样，又一次照亮了牧民们的心。在这辽阔的牧场上，到处欢腾了起来：找到了，找到了，毛主席又给了我们“金钥匙”。于是，内蒙古草原上的第一个人民公社——上都郭勒人民公社，就这样诞生了。
    变化万千
    这个公社是由十四个小型牧业社合并而成的。全社有六百八十七户牧民，二万六千多头牲畜。现在，公社成立还不到五个月，可是用蒙古族社员自己的说法，牧场上却是变化万千。
    在雪花纷飞的牧场上，记者作了一次巡礼。牧人们个个满面红光，精神奕奕，放牧着公社的一群群牲畜。全社有八十多群马牛羊。我在牧场上碰到了二、三十群，牲畜都吃得肥胖胖的，社员们说这是奇迹。的确，往年一到冬季，牲畜总是要掉膘，管理得好顶多也只能保住秋膘。这个公社建立后，打破原来小社的界线，统一使用牧场，抽调最优秀的牧民担任放牧，牲畜却增膘了。有些好奇的牧民，挑选一批上中下三种羊，过秤试了试膘情：入冬以来平均每只母羊增长了三斤多肉膘。为了牲畜安全渡过风雪季节，公社还贮备了一千四百多万斤青草，比小社时期多了一倍以上。
    我在一个居民点时，有一伙老牧民津津有味地谈论着什么“医疗队”的故事。仔细一听，原来是绵羊配种问题。其中一位老牧民说：“多少年来，咱们牧民最伤脑筋的是母畜受胎率低。现在公社可给解决了”。
    事情是这样的。公社建立后，训练了一批配种员。准备实行母畜人工授精，有些老牧民却担心起来了：母畜自然交配还受胎率低，人工授精不就更糟了吗？有的甚至认为人工授精是“不体面”的事。公社党委向老人们作了耐心的解释，便开展了工作。一个月，两个月快过去了，母畜的肚子，一天天大起来。经过配种人员检查，全社五千八百多只母羊全部受胎了，适龄大母畜的97％以上也都受了胎，比过去增加了一倍。这时，那些老牧民才真高兴呢，他们谈论起这件事就说：“公社给我们带来了新技术，以前咱可耽心错了。”
    我在牧场上碰到许多男女青壮年，一伙伙在一起劳动，有时他们又骑着马跑到别的牧场上去劳动。他们自称是建设草原的突击队，共有三百多名男女青年，牧场上哪里有建设，他们就到哪里去，老一代牧民都称他们是“公社的好社员”。突击队诞生后，他们就在一块多年无水的牧场上新建了一座机械供水站，它每天能满足一万头牲畜饮水的需要。接着，他们又在牧场上打了许多水井，又开山挖泉。干旱的草原，现在却处处有了水。
    往年，这个草原上需要的粮食和饲料，都是依靠外地供应的，这就给高速度地发展畜牧业带来了许多困难。公社建立后，人多力量大了，牧民们提议要改变这种状况。这时，突击队员们又专门组织了一个饲料生产队，在去年晚秋季节就开荒秋耕五千多亩土地。并把其中一部分深耕二尺以上，每亩施了二万斤底肥，今年公社的粮食饲料可以全部自给。由于公社资金雄厚，还买来了两台拖拉机和十多台打搂草机，饲料生产和打搂草的工作正在向着机械化的目标前进。
    在公社中心区，我还参观了公社的铁木、毛制、制毯、制靴、食品等工厂。牧区建工厂，过去往往被看作是遥远将来的事情。可是公社化了，资金多，人材也广，他们因陋就简，很快就把这些工厂办起来了。现在，这些小型加工厂已经生产出一批防寒毡靴、蒙古靴、糕点，支援城市和供应社员需要。
    在各居民点上，公社还大量创办了食堂、托儿所缝纫组等集体福利事业。四百五十多名家庭妇女，现在都兴高彩烈地参加了公社的各项劳动，也有机会学习文化和各种技术了。
    大闹文化革命
    提起文化技术，这里真是“一夜春雨，满园花开”，一支既能放牧，又能种地，也能治畜病的新牧人队伍，正在这里成长壮大。我看到每个居民点上，都有牧民政治、文化、技术业余学校分校，中心区有总校和半牧半读中学，十年制中学，共有一千五百多名学生。到晚上，男女牧民们三五成群，说说笑笑，夹着书本，到这些学校学习多种技术和继续提高他们的文化水平。中心区还有一个科学研究室，公社的同志们告诉我，这里经常有些老牧民和男女青年牧民，在一起学习讨论畜牧、兽医和饲料生产方面的科学知识。此外，还有一所党校，有五十多名党员在学习马列主义理论，学习毛主席著作。
    结束了访问，我久久地想着：今天的草原变得多么可爱啊！（附图片）
