    "Belief" and "Blind Faith"
    Zhang Pei
    People have roughly three attitudes towards knowledge or technology.

    The first is belief based on blind faith. In reality, it's not belief, but simply blind faith. True belief requires understanding the basis of certain knowledge or technology and grasping the full picture. However, the "belief" of those who believe based on blind faith comes only from "blind faith" and is not true belief. They have a vague understanding of the object of their belief. Since they blindly believe, they exclude what they are not blindly devoted to. Those blindly devoted to foreign things reject native things; those blindly devoted to the ancient reject the modern. In fact, they may not clearly understand what they reject.

    The second is being lost in blind faith through belief. This refers to becoming lost in blind faith because of belief. Originally, their belief was still considered true belief, but after believing for a long time, they can't distinguish directions, can't see the future, and think that there is only this one old brand and no other branches, and gradually become lost. Once lost, they forget to move forward and forget that things will develop, and as a result, they can only stick to old ways. This kind of blind faith is probably a common problem among scientists who bury their heads in their work and are out of touch with reality. Saying that "high rice yields" have no scientific basis; that gypsum can only be used to make plaster bandages and cannot treat type B encephalitis, etc.; many are examples of this kind of blind faith. Because they are lost in blind faith, they will inevitably oppose what they are not blindly devoted to, and thus often stand in opposition to new things, becoming conservatives.

    Another type of being lost in blind faith through belief is expert worship. They regard the achievements of their predecessors as golden rules and follow the words of experts as supreme law, not daring to step beyond the bounds. Therefore, they also become lost. When faced with new problems and new difficulties, they are at a loss, waiting for experts to solve them. This is also becoming lost in blind faith through belief. They do not understand that experts are credible, but one should not be blindly devoted to them. Experts are also made by people, not God.

    The third attitude is believing without blind faith. This can be said to be the correct attitude. Being realistic and targeted, believing in science, believing in the correct achievements of predecessors, but not being blindly devoted. Not being blindly devoted is the key to believing correctly. Blind faith prevents correct belief. We advocate learning from traditional Chinese medicine, but we must take its essence, which is believing without blind faith. Using willow branches to set bones is believing without blind faith: if you don't believe it, you won't experiment; if you are blindly devoted, you will not explore experience through multiple methods of experimentation. Deep acupuncture at the dumb gate point is also an example: if you don't believe it, you won't study it; if you are blindly devoted, you won't dare to do deep acupuncture on this "forbidden point."

    In order to achieve believing without blind faith, it is necessary to liberate our thinking and thoroughly break with superstition. We oppose both belief based on blind faith and becoming lost in blind faith through belief. We must be realistic and targeted, and leap forward on the basis of believing in science and the scientific research achievements of our predecessors. Therefore, when we break with superstition, we must pay attention to breaking with blind faith without breaking with belief, and both believe and advance. Otherwise, although we are not blindly devoted, we also do not believe, turning into nihilism in knowledge and technology, and everything can only be started from scratch, repeating the detours that our predecessors have taken, which is, of course, not in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical.

### “信”与“迷”

    “信”与“迷”
    章沛
    人对于知识或技术，大别之有三种态度。
    第一种是因迷而信。其实不是信，只是迷。本来，要弄清楚某种知识或技术的根据，又弄清楚这种知识或技术的全貌，才算是真信。然而，因迷而信者的“信”只由“迷”而来，并非真信。他们对于信的对象却是模糊不清的。既然迷信，他们就要排除他们所不迷的东西，迷于洋的，就排斥土的；迷于古的，就排斥今的；其实他们对所排斥的未必清楚。
    第二种是信迷。信迷者，由信而迷之谓。本来他们的信也还算是真信，只是信得久了，就辨不出方向，看不到前程，以为只此老号，别无分支，逐渐就迷起来。一迷，就忘记了前进，也忘记了事物是会发展的，结果只好故步自封。这种信迷，大约是埋头埋脑、脱离实际的科学家的通病。说什么“水稻高产”没有科学根据；石膏只能造石膏绷带，不能治乙型大脑炎等等；其中颇多此类信迷。因为迷了，就必然也要反对他所不迷的，于是往往与新事物对立起来，变成了保守派。
    信迷的另一种是专家迷。奉前人的成果如金科，遵专家之言为玉律，不敢越雷池半步。因此，也成了迷，在新问题，新困难面前束手无策，静待专家解决。这也是由信而迷。他们不晓得，专家可信，但不能迷。专家也是人做的，并非上帝。
    第三种态度是信而不迷。这可说是正确的态度。实事求是，有的放矢，相信科学，相信前人正确的成果，但不迷。不迷，这是信得正确的关键。迷就不能正确地信。我们提倡学习中医，但要取其精华，就是信而不迷。柳枝接骨是信而不迷：不信，就不去试验；迷，就不会在多种方法的试验中摸索经验。哑门深刺也是例子：不信，不会去研究；迷，就不敢在这“禁穴”上搞深刺。
    为了要做到信而不迷，就有必要解放思想，大破迷信。既反对因迷而信，也反对由信而迷。我们要做到实事求是，有的放矢，在相信科学，相信前人科学研究成果的基础上向前跃进。因此，我们破除迷信时，必须注意要办到破迷不破信，又信又前进。否则，虽不迷，但也不信，变成了知识和技术上的虚无主义，万事只好自起炉灶，重复前人走过的弯路，不用说是不符合多快好省的原则的。
