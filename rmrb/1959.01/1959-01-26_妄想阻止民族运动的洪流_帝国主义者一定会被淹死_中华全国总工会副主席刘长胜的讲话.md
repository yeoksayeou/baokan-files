    On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the workers of the entire country, I extend my heartfelt and lofty respect to the great Cuban people and working class for the brilliant victory they have achieved in their struggle against dictatorship and for democratic freedom. I express my full support for the firm will and tenacious fighting spirit of the Cuban people and working class in opposing the shameless interference of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, I express my utmost indignation at the bloody massacre of Congolese patriots by the Belgian ruling clique, and I express my most resolute support for the great Congolese people who are holding high the torch of anti-colonialism.

    The great victory of the Cuban people against the Batista dictatorial regime, which was fostered single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, is not only a victory for the Cuban people but also a victory for the anti-colonialist struggle for national independence of the people of Latin America and the world. This victory is a tremendous inspiration to the people of Latin America and Asia and Africa, where the raging fire of anti-colonialism is burning. This victory shows that the people of Latin America can no longer tolerate U.S. imperialism running around and biting like a mad dog in this beautiful garden of Latin America, can no longer tolerate U.S. imperialism's piratical plunder of Latin American countries, and can no longer tolerate the fascist rule of the U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries over the people. After a long and arduous armed struggle, the Cuban people overthrew this "Cuban Hitler" propped up by the guns of U.S. imperialism. This fully proves the truth, as Chairman Mao said, that imperialism and reactionaries, though seemingly powerful, are nothing but paper tigers, strong in appearance but weak in reality. They are bound to be crushed by the wheel of history. The reason for this lies in the fact that imperialism and reactionaries represent reactionary decline, while the people represent progress.

    The Chinese working class is watching with great anger all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cuban people. As everyone knows, it was the United States that supplied the Batista reactionaries with arms and dollars when the Cuban people, under the leadership of the patriot Castro, were waging a difficult struggle; it was the United States that carried out various military and diplomatic threats against the Cuban people when their armed uprising achieved victory; and it is the United States that is sheltering these criminals who have committed heinous crimes like treasures when the Cuban people put forward the just demand to try the members of the Batista reactionary ruling clique. Let alone the fact that the United States is monopolizing Cuba's rich resources and the economic lifeline of the whole country. All of this tells the Cuban people, and tells the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, especially the people of Latin America, and it is the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. The working class of our country is very pleased to see that the Cuban people have already given U.S. imperialism a resounding slap in the face for its shameless interference. The mass demonstration of a million people in Havana on the 21st of this month powerfully proves the great strength of the Cuban people in opposing U.S. imperialism's interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The working class of our country expresses its deep admiration for the overwhelming power demonstrated by the Cuban people in the anti-imperialist struggle. A heroic nation like the Cuban people will always be invincible. As long as they persevere in their struggle, they will surely achieve even greater victories in the future.

    Our working class is equally delighted by the heroic struggle of the Congolese people. The Congolese people have long lived in dire straits under the cruel rule of the Belgian colonialists, but the heroic Congolese people, disregarding the bayonets and bombs of the Belgian colonialists, have shown strong resistance to colonial rule with unparalleled courage. The Chinese working class once had the same miserable situation as the Cuban and Congolese people, and suffered the same long-term and cruel oppression of imperialism, so they have a deep understanding of the situation of the Cuban and Congolese people. The heroic struggle of the Congolese people has won the deep sympathy of workers and people all over China and the world. We express our strongest protest against the Belgian colonialists' cruel suppression of the just struggle of the Congolese people. We believe that as long as the Congolese people struggle unyieldingly and persistently, overcome difficulties, they will, like us in China and many other colonial and semi-colonial countries, break the chains of colonialism and win final liberation.

    Now is an era of unparalleled strength of the socialist camp and unprecedented development of national independence movements. The struggle against colonialism is burning like dry wood meeting raging fire, spreading all over Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The twentieth century is the century in which the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries are turning over a new leaf. This is the inevitable result of historical development. The imperialists and reactionaries of all countries who want to stop the advance of this great torrent will inevitably drown in this historical torrent.

    Support the Cuban national democratic revolutionary movement!
    Support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence!
    Down with the imperialist colonial system!
    Long live the victory of the national liberation movement!

    妄想阻止民族运动的洪流  帝国主义者一定会被淹死
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜的讲话
    我代表中华全国总工会和全国职工，衷心地对伟大的古巴人民和工人阶级在反对独裁、争取民主自由斗争中所取得的光辉胜利，表示热烈、崇高的敬意。对古巴人民和工人阶级反对美帝国主义无耻干涉的坚决意志和顽强的斗争精神表示全力的支持。同时我对比利时统治集团血腥屠杀刚果爱国者的罪行，表示最大的愤慨，对于伟大的高举反殖民主义火炬的刚果人民表示最坚决的支持。
    古巴人民反对由美帝国主义所一手扶持起来的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的伟大胜利，不仅是古巴人民的胜利，也是拉丁美洲和全世界人民反殖民主义、争取民族独立斗争的胜利，这个胜利对于正在燃烧起反殖民主义熊熊烈火的拉丁美洲和亚洲、非洲人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。这个胜利表明：拉丁美洲人民再也不能容忍美帝国主义像疯狗一样在拉丁美洲这个美丽的花园里乱窜乱咬，再也不能容忍美帝国主义对拉丁美洲各国进行海盗式的掠夺，再也不能容忍美帝国主义和反动派对人民的法西斯统治。古巴人民在进行长期的艰苦的武装斗争以后，把这个由美帝国主义的枪杆子所支撑的“古巴的希特勒”打倒了。这完全证明像毛主席所说的帝国主义和反动派虽然貌似强大，不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎这一真理。他们必然要被历史的巨轮压得粉碎，这原因不是别的，就在于帝国主义和反动派代表反动没落，而人民代表进步。
    中国工人阶级十分愤怒地注视着美帝国主义干涉古巴人民的内政的各种阴谋活动。大家知道，当古巴人民在爱国者卡斯特罗的领导下进行艰苦斗争的时候，用军火和美元供应巴蒂斯塔反动派的是美国；当古巴人民的武装起义取得胜利的时候，对古巴人民进行各种军事和外交恫吓的是美国；当古巴人民提出审讯巴蒂斯塔反动统治集团分子的正义要求的时候，把这些犯有滔天罪行的罪犯像宝贝一样庇护起来的又是美国；我们这里且不说垄断古巴丰富的资源和全国经济命脉的，又是美国这个事实了。所有这些都告诉古巴人民，告诉亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，美帝国主义是全世界人民特别是拉丁美洲人民最凶恶的敌人，它是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。我国工人阶级十分高兴地看到古巴人民已经给美帝国主义的无耻干涉打了一记响亮的耳光，本月21日哈瓦那百万人民的大示威，强有力地证明古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政的伟大力量。我国工人阶级对古巴人民在反帝国主义斗争中所表现出来的这种排山倒海的力量，表示深深的钦佩。像古巴人民这样英勇的民族，将永远是不可战胜的，只要他们坚持斗争，他们今后必然会取得更伟大的胜利。
    我们工人阶级同样为刚果人民的英勇斗争欢欣鼓舞。刚果人民长期在比利时殖民者的残酷统治下，过着水深火热的生活，但是英勇的刚果人民，不顾比利时殖民者的刺刀和炸弹，以无比的英勇，对殖民统治表示强烈的反抗。中国工人阶级曾经有过同古巴和刚果人民同样凄惨的境遇，同样遭受到帝国主义长期的残酷的压迫，因此对古巴和刚果人民的境况有着深切的体会。刚果人民的英勇斗争博得了全中国和全世界工人和人民的深刻同情。我们对比利时殖民者对刚果人民正义斗争的残酷镇压表示最大的抗议。我们相信刚果人民只要百折不挠地顽强斗争，克服困难，他们一定会像我们中国和许多其他殖民地半殖民地国家一样，打断殖民主义的锁链，获得最后的解放。
    现在是社会主义阵营无比强大、民族独立运动空前发展的时代，反殖民主义的斗争像干柴遇烈火一样，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲漫山遍野地燃烧着。二十世纪是殖民地、半殖民地国家人民翻身的世纪，这是历史发展的必然结果，帝国主义和各国反动派想阻止这个巨流的前进，就必然会淹死在这历史的洪流中。
    支持古巴民族民主革命运动！
    支持刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争！
    打倒帝国主义殖民制度！
    民族解放运动胜利万岁！
