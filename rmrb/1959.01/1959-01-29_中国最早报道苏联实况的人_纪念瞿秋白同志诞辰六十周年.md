    The Earliest Chinese Reporter of Soviet Realities
    ——Commemorating the Sixtieth Anniversary of Comrade Qu Qiubai's Birth
    Shou He
    The first Chinese to eulogize the victory of the October Revolution was Comrade Li Dazhao, who published articles such as "The Victory of the Common People" and "The Victory of Bolshevism" in "New Youth." The first Chinese to deeply observe the reality on the ground and truthfully and specifically introduce and report to the Chinese people the true situation after the Russian Revolution was Comrade Qu Qiubai.
    In October 1920, Comrade Qu Qiubai was hired by the Beijing "Morning Post" as a special correspondent stationed in Moscow to conduct on-the-spot interviews in the Soviet Union. At that time, Comrade Qiubai was deeply influenced by the ideas of the October Revolution and had a deeper understanding of China's internal and external troubles. He was an active participant in the May Fourth Movement. Therefore, with great enthusiasm and the mentality of "taking responsibility for the ideological development of China's regeneration era," he went to the Soviet state to find the truth to save and transform China, and to "open up a bright path" for the Chinese people.
    Along the way, in Harbin, Manzhouli, and Chita in Russia, Comrade Qu Qiubai continuously wrote dispatches, reporting his observations and thoughts along the way. During his two years in Moscow, the "Red Capital," Comrade Qiubai, despite his poor health and frequent illnesses, still used all his strength to conduct interviews, investigations, and research, and wrote many articles. In addition to the famous "A Journey Through a Starving Land" (renamed "Travels in New Russia" by the Commercial Press when it was published) and "A History of the Soul in the Red Capital," two magnificent prose works, as well as a theoretical work exploring the Russian Revolution, "The Russian Revolution" (which was banned by the Northern Warlords and could not be published), from June 1921 to November 1922, he also published dozens of extremely important political dispatches in the "Morning Post," including: "The Humanization of Communism," "The Question of Russian Workers and Cooperatives," "The Economic Problems of Soviet Russia," "The New Situation of the Internal and Foreign Affairs of the Labor-Peasant Government," and "The New Atmosphere of the Russian Economy." He systematically reported and introduced the Soviet Union's politics, economy, culture, diplomacy, party building, workers' organizations, peasant issues, and ethnic issues, totaling more than 160,000 words.
    This was the first comprehensive report made by a Chinese to the people of the whole country about the various aspects of the great socialist country after the October Revolution, which had an extremely profound and far-reaching impact in China. It not only shattered the various slanders and deceptive propaganda of imperialism and domestic reactionaries, but also attracted more people to care about and yearn for the growth of this new country, further promoting the spread of Marxism in China.
    When Comrade Qu Qiubai arrived in the Soviet Union, it was a difficult period for the Soviet people, who had experienced four years of imperialist war and three years of civil war and resistance to foreign armed intervention. The economy had suffered great damage and faced great difficulties. At that time, many Western bourgeois journalists, with malicious intent, exaggerated the situation in every possible way, depicting post-revolutionary Russia as a hopeless and blood-filled tragic picture. However, Comrade Qu Qiubai's dispatches and works were completely different: he did not avoid the various difficulties and economic predicaments encountered after the Russian Revolution, but at the same time, he pointed out the determination and courage of the Soviet working class and working peasants in overcoming these difficulties under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, and reported with a large number of facts the various measures taken by the Soviet Party and government to overcome these difficulties, vividly depicting the magnificent spirit of the Soviet people struggling to build a new life. Therefore, he repeatedly stated that the foundation of the Labor-Peasant Government was becoming more and more consolidated, and that "the October Revolution is becoming more and more obvious day by day in the history of human culture and in the interests of Russian laborers."
    Comrade Qu Qiubai spent two years in Moscow. He was tempered in the great revolutionary furnace, and after careful research and thinking, he finally joined the Chinese Communist Party in February 1922, becoming a steel warrior dedicated to the great communist cause, and finally dedicated his precious life.

    中国最早报道苏联实况的人
    ——纪念瞿秋白同志诞辰六十周年
    守和
    中国最早歌颂十月革命的胜利的是李大钊同志，他在“新青年”上发表了“庶民的胜利”、“布尔什维主义的胜利”等文。中国第一个深入实地观察，真实而具体地向中国人民大众介绍和报道俄国革命后的真情实况的，是瞿秋白同志。
    1920年10月，瞿秋白同志受聘于北京“晨报”，担任驻莫斯科的特派记者，去苏联实地采访。秋白同志当时已深受十月革命的思想影响，对中国所遭受的内忧外患也有了较深的了解，是五四运动的积极参加者。因此，他抱着满腔的热情，怀着“担一份中国再生时代思想发展的责任”的心情，到苏维埃国家去寻找挽救中国、改造中国的真理，为中国人民“辟一条光明的路”。
    一路上，在哈尔滨、在满洲里以及俄境的赤塔等地，瞿秋白同志就不断写通讯，报道途中见闻和感想。在“赤都”莫斯科的两年中间，秋白同志尽管身体很坏，常常病倒，但他还是用一切力量进行访问、调查、研究，写了许多文章。除了有名的“饿乡纪程”（出版时商务印书馆改名为“新俄国游记”）、“赤都心史”两部气势雄伟的散文作品以及一部探讨俄国革命的“俄罗斯革命论”（这本书遭到北洋军阀的禁止，未能出版）理论作品之外，从1921年6月到1922年11月，还在“晨报”上发表了：“共产主义之人间化”、“俄罗斯工人及协作社问题”、“苏维埃俄罗斯之经济问题”、“劳农政府之内政外交之新局面”、“俄国经济之新气象”等数十篇极为重要的政治性的通讯，对苏联的政治、经济、文化、外交、党的建设、工人组织、农民问题、民族问题等，都作了系统的报道和介绍，总数达十六万字之多。
    这是在十月革命后，中国人第一次向全国人民所作的关于伟大的社会主义国家各方面情况的全面报告，在中国发生了极为深广的影响。它不但粉碎了帝国主义和国内反动派的各种污蔑和欺骗宣传，而且吸引了更多的人们关心和向往这个新国家的成长，进一步推动了马克思主义在中国的传播。
    瞿秋白同志到苏联时，正是苏联人民经历了四年帝国主义战争和三年国内战争与抵抗外国武装干涉的艰苦岁月，经济上遭到极大的破坏，面临着极大困难的时候。当时不少西方资产阶级记者，就曾心怀敌意地百般渲染，将革命后的俄国描绘成一幅毫无希望的、充满热血的悲惨图景。然而，瞿秋白同志的通讯和作品却完全不是这样：他并没有回避俄国革命后所遇到的种种困难和经济上的窘况，但同时更指出苏联工人阶级和劳动农民在布尔什维克党领导下克服这些困难的决心和勇气，以大量的事实报道了苏联党和政府为克服这些困难所采取的种种措施，生动地描绘了苏联人民为建设新生活而斗争的雄伟的气概。因此，他反复说明：劳农政府的基础愈来愈加巩固，“十月革命在人类文化史上，在俄国劳动者的利益上，一天一天更加明显起来。”
    瞿秋白同志在莫斯科为时两年，他在革命的大熔炉里受到了陶冶和他经过细心的研究和思索，终于在1922年2月参加了中国共产党，成为献身伟大共产主义事业的钢铁战士，最后并献出了自己宝贵的生命。
