    Between Teachers and Students
    Zhao Nan
    In the process of combining education and productive labor, teachers and students in many universities have closely cooperated to jointly compile teaching syllabuses and textbooks, jointly participate in productive labor, and jointly conduct scientific research. Teachers teach well, students learn well, teachers and students promote the spirit of unity and democracy, and a new type of teacher-student relationship has emerged. It should be said that this is an important victory in teaching reform and a victory in following the mass line in teaching work under the leadership of the Party. The Sichuan University Party Committee's recent further strengthening of the unity between teachers and students to consolidate this achievement is very necessary.
    Facts have made a good explanation. In the past, some educators believed that education could only be "teachers speak, students listen," and students could not offer opinions to teachers. That is wrong. This view hindered the progress of education. "When three men are walking together, there is sure to be one who can act as my teacher. Therefore, a disciple need not be inferior to his teacher, nor a teacher more virtuous than his disciple." "It is like piling up firewood; the later ones come to be on top." This view is dialectical and in accordance with objective reality. Teachers should treat students and the masses with this spirit, and promptly absorb new content and new ideas in teaching.
    For students, it is very important to promote a creative spirit of learning. However, one must never sever ties with history and discard the knowledge accumulated by human society over thousands of years. Much of the knowledge imparted by teachers is useful and very important. Naturally, this knowledge should be linked to reality. Over the past year, many teachers have gradually combined with production practice and gradually transformed their one-sided knowledge into complete knowledge, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Students should humbly learn useful knowledge from teachers and respect teachers' labor. For those teachers who have shortcomings and mistakes, as long as they are willing and are in the process of correcting their shortcomings and mistakes, they should be patiently helped and waited for. The bourgeois academic thoughts of certain teachers should be gradually resolved in accordance with the spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.
    On the basis of the great achievements already made in teaching reform, teachers should integrate with production practice, mingle with students, understand students' needs, involve students in teaching and scientific research, constantly criticize their own incorrect ideas and practices, establish a new teaching order, and establish teaching ideas that adapt to the new situation. If teachers treat their teaching work with the spirit of teaching until old and learning until old, and constantly seek progress, then new teaching content and teaching methods will emerge continuously.
    In universities, a democratic atmosphere of academic research should be established between teachers and students. Students, after studying diligently, offer opinions to teachers in order to learn better; teachers accept students' opinions in order to teach better. Only when teachers and students combine and learn from each other can a lively and cheerful teaching atmosphere be formed, which will not only help improve the quality of teaching, but also help carry out academic research. A university professor handed over his revised Red and Expert plan to the students for supervision and implementation. The students posted the plan on the wall, with the horizontal inscription "I Love My Teacher," and the couplets on both sides were "In the Great Leap Forward, blossom the flowers of the Great Leap Forward" and "In Red and Expert, formulate Red and Expert plans." This vivid example reflects the new type of teacher-student relationship in the pursuit of truth. We need to further develop the new type of teacher-student relationship of teachers and students combined under the leadership of the Party committee.

    师生之间
    召南
    在教育和生产劳动结合的过程中，许多高等学校的教师和学生密切合作，共同编写了教学大纲和教材，共同参加了生产劳动，共同进行了科学研究工作。教师教得好，学生学得好，教师和学生之间发扬了团结民主的精神，出现了新型的师生关系。应该说，这是教学改革中的一个重要的胜利，是在党的领导下的教学工作走群众路线的胜利。四川大学的党委最近进一步地加强教师和学生的团结，来巩固这一成果，是非常必要的。
    事实已经作了很好的说明，过去有些教育工作者认为，教育只能“先生讲，学生听”，学生不能向先生提意见。那是不对的。这种观点，妨碍了教育工作的进步。“三人行，则必有我师。是故弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子。”“譬比积薪，后来居上。”这种观点是辩证的，是符合客观实际的。教师应当以这种精神对待学生和群众，要在教学中及时吸收新内容，新思想。
    对于学生来说，发扬创造性的学习精神，是很重要的。但是，绝不能割断历史，抛去人类社会几千年积累起来的知识。教师所传授的知识，许多都是有用的，是很重要的。自然，这些知识，应该联系实际。一年来，许多教师已经逐步结合生产实践，逐步把他们片面的知识，改变成完全的知识，这是可喜的现象。学生要虚心去学习教师有用的知识，尊重教师的劳动。对于那些有缺点和错误的教师，只要他们愿意和正在改正自己的缺点和错误，就应该耐心地帮助和等待。对于某些教师的资产阶级学术思想应该根据百家争鸣的精神，逐步解决。
    在教学改革已获得巨大成就的基础上，教师要同生产实际结合，同学生打成一片，了解学生的需要，吸收学生参加教学和科学研究工作，不断批判自己的不正确的想法和做法，建立新的教学秩序，树立适应新形势的教学思想。教师以教到老、学到老的精神对待自己的教学工作，不断求进步，那么，新的教学内容、教学方法便会源源出现。
    在高等学校中，教师和学生之间，要建立起民主的学术研究的空气。学生经过钻研，向教师提出意见，是为了更好地学；教师接受学生意见，是为了更好地教。只有师生结合，教学相长，才能形成一片生动活泼、心情舒畅的教学空气，既有助于教学质量的提高，也有助于学术研究的开展。一个大学教授把自己修订的红专规划交给学生监督执行。学生把这个规划贴在墙上，横额写上“我爱我师”，两边的对联是“跃进里，开跃进之花”，“红专中，订红专规划”。这个生动事例，正体现了教师和学生在追求真理的新型师生关系。我们需要进一步发展在党委领导下的教师同学生结合的新型的师生关系。
