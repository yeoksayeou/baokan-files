Small Commodities Are Not To Be Underestimated
Ye Keng

Shanghai has done a great job in vigorously promoting the production and supply of small commodities.

Small commodities appear to be trivial things: needles and thread, bowls and spoons, pacifiers, etc. The commodities are small, and the output value is also small. Because they are small, their production and supply are sometimes easily overlooked. For example, when there is a shortage of raw material supply, they may be squeezed out if we are not careful.

However, although small commodities are small, they have a significant impact on people's lives. Every household needs brooms and dustpans for sweeping the floor in the morning, and everyone needs bowls, chopsticks, and spoons for eating. Even for the most common housework like sewing and mending, it is impossible without needles and thread. Moreover, many small commodities are auxiliary raw materials and accessories for large commodities; without them, the use of large commodities is also affected. For example, if you have cotton cloth but lack buttons and collar hooks, you still cannot make clothes. For sewing factories and those who make clothes, this is as distressing as lacking cotton cloth.

It can be seen that although small commodities are small, they cannot be ignored at all. The output value of small commodities is small, and they are easily overlooked, so we should pay more attention to arranging the production and supply of small commodities while grasping the production and supply of large commodities.

Whether or not to pay attention to the production and supply of small commodities is one question; whether the production and supply of small commodities can be done well is another question. Small commodities have a wide variety of colors and designs, and their production is scattered, making them more troublesome to handle, but this is only one aspect of the problem. Another aspect of the problem is that small commodities are, after all, very small, and the raw materials they require are also small, making them relatively easy to handle. For example, using the leftover materials, scraps, and waste materials from large factories' production can produce many small general merchandise and small hardware products; even if whole materials are used, the consumption is not large. One ton of rubber can be used to manufacture 250,000 rubber pacifiers. It can be seen that if we really want to抓 (graps) it, we can still find many ways. Isn't Shanghai an example?

More than twenty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work": "All practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become the organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." The production and supply of small commodities are related to all aspects of people's lives, so it is not just a market supply problem, but also a problem of caring for the lives of the masses. The commercial and handicraft departments should also focus on this work and try to meet the needs of people's lives in all aspects.

    小商品不可小看
    叶铿
    上海市大抓小商品的生产和供应，抓得很好。
    小商品看来都是些鸡毛蒜皮的小东西：一针一线，一碗一匙，一个奶嘴等等，商品既小，产值也小。因为小，它的生产和供应有时就比较容易被人们忽视。譬如遇到原材料供应不足的时候，稍一疏忽，就有被挤掉的可能。
    然而，小商品虽小，对人民生活的影响却颇大。家家户户早起扫地不能没有扫帚、簸箕，老老少少吃饭不能没有碗筷、羹匙，就连缝缝补补这种最普通的家务事，缺了针线也是不行的。何况很多小商品还是大商品的附属原料和配件；缺了它，大商品的使用也受到影响。例如，有了棉布，没有钮扣、领勾，还是做不成衣服；对于缝纫工厂和做衣服的人说来，这同缺少棉布一样，是件苦恼的事情。
    由此可见，小商品虽小，却丝毫也不能忽视；小商品产值小，容易被忽视，我们就更应该注意在抓大商品生产和供应的同时，也不忽视安排小商品的生产和供应。
    重视不重视小商品的生产和供应是一个问题；小商品的生产和供应能不能抓好，又是一个问题。小商品的花色繁杂，生产零星，抓起来是比较麻烦的，但这也只是问题的一个方面。问题的另一个方面是，小商品毕竟很小，所需要的原材料也很少，又有比较容易抓的一面。例如，利用大工厂生产中剩余的零料、碎料和废料，就能做出许多小百货、小五金商品；即便使用整料，耗用量也不大，一吨橡胶就可以制造二十五万个橡皮奶头。可见，真要抓起来，还是可以找出不少办法来的。上海不是一个例子吗？
    二十多年前，毛泽东同志在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的演讲中就曾指出：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”小商品的生产和供应关系着人民生活的各个方面，因而它不只是一个市场供应问题，而且也是一个关心群众生活的问题。商业部门和手工业部门应该把这方面的工作也抓一抓，尽可能满足人们生活各方面的需要。
