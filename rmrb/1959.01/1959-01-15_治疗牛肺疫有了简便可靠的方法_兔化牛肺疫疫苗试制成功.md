Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 14th: The rabbit-adapted bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine, researched and trial-produced by the Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has proven to be effective, safe, and reliable after regional promotion in pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Henan, Shandong, and other places.

Bovine contagious pleuropneumonia is a malignant infectious disease of cattle, characterized by concentrated outbreaks, rapid transmission, and mortality rates as high as 70% in some areas. The revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program lists it as one of the most serious diseases endangering livestock, requiring all regions to basically eliminate it within seven or twelve years wherever possible.

In the past, vaccines for preventing bovine contagious pleuropneumonia were cultivated using culture media (creating an environment for bacterial growth and development artificially), making the manufacturing method complex and difficult to promote. Scientific workers in the Bovine and Ovine Disease Research Office of the Veterinary Research Institute, using the Michurin principle of "directed variation of organisms," attempted to inject bovine lung vaccines into the chest cavity of rabbits, using forced infection to pass the bacteria through the rabbit's body to obtain a bovine lung vaccine. With the support of the Party organization, after many experiments, failures, and re-experiments, they finally succeeded. In the second half of last year, when bovine contagious pleuropneumonia broke out in parts of Henan, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia, the rabbit-adapted bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine was used to inoculate and prevent the disease in 120,000 cattle, quickly controlling the spread.

The characteristics of this vaccine are: simple manufacturing method, low cost, and easy to promote and apply. Cities, counties, communes, or livestock farms can manufacture it locally with simple equipment. The vaccine obtained from one rabbit can be used to inoculate 1,500 cattle, costing only one fen per injection per head, only one-eighth of the cost of vaccines cultivated using culture media. Five counties in Henan Province, including Hua County, Changyuan, and Fengqiu, established a collaboration zone in December last year to trial-produce rabbit-adapted bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine, and the vaccine produced by the end of the year can meet the epidemic prevention needs of more than 200,000 cattle in the five counties.

In order to promote the use of the rabbit-adapted bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine, the Veterinary Research Institute held a field workshop on rabbit-adapted bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine in Anyang County, Henan Province at the end of December last year, explaining the manufacturing and usage methods in detail to agricultural, pastoral, and veterinary personnel from 23 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and organized attendees to visit the injection reactions on site.

    治疗牛肺疫有了简便可靠的方法
    兔化牛肺疫疫苗试制成功
    新华社哈尔滨14日电　中国农业科学院兽医研究所研究试制成功的兔化牛肺疫疫苗，经过在内蒙古牧区、河南、山东等地进行区域性的推广，证明疗效良好，安全可靠。
    牛肺疫是牛的一种恶性传染病，发病集中，传染很快，死亡率有的地区高达70％。全国农业发展纲要修正草案把它列为危害牲畜最严重的病疫之一，要求各地分别在七年或者十二年内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭它。
    过去，预防牛肺疫的疫苗都用培养基（用人为的方法造成细菌生长和发育的环境）培养，制造方法复杂，不容易推广。兽医研究所牛羊病研究室的科学工作者们运用米丘林“生物的定向变异”原理，尝试着把牛肺疫苗注射到兔子的胸腔，用强迫感染的方法，使细菌通过兔子的身体，以获得牛肺疫苗。他们在党组织的支持下，经过多次的试验、失败、再试验，终于获得成功。去年下半年，河南、山东、内蒙古的部分地区发生牛肺疫时，用兔化牛肺疫疫苗对十二万头牛进行注射防治，很快就控制了传染。
    这种疫苗的特点是：制作方法简便、成本低廉、便于推广应用。各市、县、公社或畜牧场只要有简单的设备，就可以就地制造。从一只兔子取得的疫苗可以注射一千五百头牛，每头牛注射一次只要一分钱，成本只有用培养基培养的疫苗的八分之一。河南省滑县、长垣、封丘等五县从去年12月建立协作区试制兔化牛肺疫疫苗，到年底制成的疫苗即可满足五个县二十多万头牛的防疫需要。
    为了推广使用兔化牛肺疫疫苗，兽医研究所去年12月底曾在河南安阳县召开兔化牛肺疫疫苗现场讲习会，向二十三个省、市、自治区的农牧兽医有关人员详细讲解了制造与使用方法，并组织到会人员实地参观了注射反应。
