Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 27th: Representatives of eleven Japanese groups, including the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, held a meeting in Tokyo today and jointly issued a "Joint Statement on Opening Japan-China Relations." The statement said that strengthening and consolidating the friendly relations between the people of Japan and China is an indispensable condition for seeking Japan's peace and prosperity.

    The statement pointed out that Asian countries live together in peace, democratic independence, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit, and friendship, and have achieved success. The urgent task for us to strive for a peaceful Japan is to make Japan stand in a neutral position and cooperate with these countries to move towards the road of striving for prosperity, and the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and China is a prerequisite for realizing this task.

    The statement pointed out that because the Nobusuke Kishi government does not take this path, there is a danger of delaying the future of the Japanese nation.

    The statement pointed out that Japan-China relations have been in a stalemate for eight months, but there is still no sign of breaking the deadlock. This responsibility should be borne by the Nobusuke Kishi government. The statement pointed out that as long as the fundamental attitude of the Nobusuke Kishi government has not changed, it will be difficult to break the stalemate in Japan-China relations.

    The statement said that in order to open up the current situation in Japan-China relations, we demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government clearly state that it will restore Japan-China diplomatic relations, must not make any statements or actions that violate this purpose, and immediately take the necessary measures to establish friendly relations; and that the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, in accordance with the demands of public opinion, pass the necessary resolutions to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, in order to urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to implement them.

    The statement finally called on the Japanese people to express their desire to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations in the upcoming House of Councillors elections and local elections, and to support the efforts of various groups to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.

    The statement was signed by Koin Otani, Chairman of the Executive Committee for the Repatriation of the Souls of Martyrs Who Died in China; Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman of the Japan-China Fisheries Council; Akira Kazami, Executive Director of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations; Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association; Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the International Trade Promotion Association; Fukutaro Tamura, Chairman of the League of Local Assembly Members Promoting International Trade; Kenzo Nakajima, Executive Director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association; Eiichi Shukutani, Chairman of the Wuhan Guangzhou Japan Commodity Exhibition; Kubushiro Ochimi, Chairman of the Japan-China Women's Exchange Association; Kanzo Uchiyama, Executive Director of the Japan-China Friendship Association; and Shonai Morii, Chairman of the Kansai Small and Medium Enterprise Japan-China Trade Association.

    日本十一个团体发表共同声明
    要求树立日中友好关系
    指斥岸政府应对日中关系僵局负责
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议等十一个团体的代表今天在东京举行会议，联名发表一项“关于打开日中关系的共同声明”。声明说，加强和巩固日中两国人民的友好关系对于谋求日本的和平与繁荣是不可缺少的条件。
    声明指出，亚洲各国在和平、民主独立、互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政、平等互利和友好的基础上相处并且取得了成就。我们为建立和平的日本而努力的紧要课题就是使日本站在中立的立场同这些国家互相合作，走向争取繁荣的道路，而树立日中两国友好关系是实现这种课题的前提。
    声明指出，由于岸信介政府不走这条道路，目前存在着耽误日本民族前途的危险。
    声明指出，日中关系陷入僵局已经有了八个月，但是至今还看不到打开僵局的曙光，这种责任应该由岸信介政府来承担。声明指出，只要岸信介政府的根本态度没有改变，就难于打开日中关系的僵局。
    声明说，为了打开目前日中关系的局面，我们要求岸信介政府明确表示要恢复日中邦交，必须不做任何违背这种宗旨的言行，并且立即采取为建立友好关系所必要的措施；要求日本国会参、众两院根据社会舆论的要求，通过为打开日中关系的僵局所必要的决议，以便促使岸信介政府付诸实行。
    声明最后要求日本人民即将在到来的参议院选举和地方选举中表示他们要求打开日中关系僵局的愿望，并且支持各团体为打开日中关系僵局所作的努力。
    在这项声明上签名的有中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会委员长大谷莹润、日中渔业协议会会长平冢常次郎、恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章、日中贸易促进会专务理事铃木一雄、国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一、地方议员促进国际贸易联盟会长田村福太郎、日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏、武汉广州日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一、日中妇女交流会会长久布白落实、日中友好协会理事长内山完造、关西中小企业日中贸易协会会长森井庄内。
