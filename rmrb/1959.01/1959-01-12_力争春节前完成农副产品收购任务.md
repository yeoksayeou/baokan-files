Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Instructions on Vigorously Completing the Task of Purchasing and Transporting Agricultural Products" in late October last year, a mass agricultural product purchase campaign of unprecedented scale has been launched throughout the country. In more than two months, the agricultural product purchasing work has made great achievements. As of the end of 1958, comparing the absolute purchase volume of major agricultural products with the purchase volume in 1957, grain increased by 24.2% compared with the same period in 1957, cotton increased by 76.4%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 136%, and live pigs increased by 22.3%. The reason why such great achievements can be made in a short period of time on the agricultural product purchase front is the result of the political leadership and unified leadership of party committees at all levels, and the great efforts and selfless labor of the vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses. The practice of agricultural product purchasing campaigns has also fully proved that the combination of purchasing work and mass movements, the adoption of large movements containing small movements, long movements containing short movements, the combination of crash purchases and regular purchases, and the combination of crash transportation and regular transportation are completely correct purchasing methods.

In particular, since recently, many regions have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee in the purchasing of agricultural and sideline products, and the purchasing work has been done more practically and meticulously. Most regions have conscientiously inventoried and verified the agricultural products that have been collected, and cleared up economic procedures. All these situations show that the agricultural product purchasing campaign is gradually unfolding and deepening.

At present, although the purchase of agricultural products has made great achievements, there is still a considerable distance from the state's planned purchase task. From now until the Spring Festival, there are less than a month left. After the Spring Festival, the vast rural areas will be busy with spring plowing and production. In the final stage of agricultural product purchasing, striving for time and basically collecting all the agricultural and sideline products that should be purchased before the Spring Festival is still a very arduous task. Especially in areas where the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products has been poorly completed, further strengthening the purchasing of agricultural and sideline products is still one of the central tasks of the local party committees and commercial departments. Because only by fully completing the state's agricultural and sideline product purchasing plan can we meet the needs of industrial departments for agricultural and sideline product raw materials, meet the needs of the masses for the consumption of agricultural and sideline products, and meet the requirements of the people's communes and the vast number of commune members to sell agricultural and sideline products, so that the people's communes can exchange various necessary means of production and means of livelihood after selling agricultural and sideline products. Therefore, we should publicize the great achievements of agricultural and sideline product purchasing to the vast number of grassroots cadres, and at the same time strengthen political and ideological education, so that they can continue to work hard and vigorously grasp the agricultural and sideline product purchasing work in this last period of time, especially the purchasing of cotton and oil crops, and comprehensively complete the state's purchasing plan. In this way, not only can the urban and rural economy be greatly revitalized, but also the necessary material conditions can be prepared for a greater leap forward in industry and agriculture in 1959.

The key to striving to complete the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products before the Spring Festival still lies in combining the purchasing work with mass movements. However, we must also see that as the purchasing work deepens step by step, the tasks also become more and more complicated. This requires us to do our work more meticulously on the basis of vigorously carrying out mass movements. For example, with the increase in the amount of cotton purchased, it brings heavy storage and processing problems. If the storage and processing work cannot keep up, it will affect the progress of the purchase. This requires proper and meticulous solutions to the problems of storage capacity, packaging tools, maintenance of processing machines, and repair of parts. For example, to ensure the quality of agricultural products, it is necessary to strengthen grading and inspection. These problems seem to be trivial, but if they are ignored, the state will suffer losses. Therefore, all regions must conscientiously solve these problems. For places where the work has not been done meticulously enough in the past, efforts should be made to remedy them. Hebei Province, in conjunction with the cotton purchasing work, proposed a "three searches" movement, namely, searching for fallen flowers, stiff petal flowers (cotton formed after frost) and "eyelashes" (cotton that has not been completely picked). In the late December of last year, Handan and Shijiazhuang prefectures alone found 30 million catties of cotton. This meticulous approach is worth promoting. In short, the more meticulous the work is done, the more smoothly the purchasing movement can be carried out and make substantial progress.

At present, the development of the agricultural product purchasing campaign in various regions is unbalanced: many regions have completed the purchasing plan, but there are also many regions that are far from completing the purchasing task; some regions have completed the purchasing of certain varieties well, but the completion of other varieties is relatively poor. This requires different tasks and requirements to be put forward according to different situations. However, no matter which region or which situation, we should walk on "two legs." To be specific, we should not only grasp the quantity, but also grasp the quality; not only grasp the major agricultural products, but also grasp the minor local and sideline products; not only grasp the "domestic" products, but also grasp the wild plants; not only grasp the purchase, but also grasp the processing and transportation.

We believe that as long as party committees at all levels strengthen unified leadership and overall arrangements for agricultural and sideline products, closely combine with the work of rectifying the commune, closely combine the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of cadres with a down-to-earth style, and conscientiously and meticulously handle various specific problems in the purchasing links, we will definitely be able to purchase the agricultural and sideline products that should be purchased before the Spring Festival in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

### 力争春节前完成农副产品收购任务

    力争春节前完成农副产品收购任务
    中共中央和国务院在去年10月下旬发出“关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的指示”以后，全国各地就掀起了一个规模空前的群众性的农产品收购运动。在两个多月的时间内，农产品收购工作取得了很大的成绩。截至1958年年底，如以主要农产品的绝对收购数和1957年收购数相比，粮食比1957年同期收购数增加了24.2％，棉花增加了76.4％，烤烟增加了136％，生猪增加了22.3％。在农产品收购战线上所以能在短期内取得这样大的成绩，是各级党委政治挂帅和统一领导、广大基层干部和群众鼓足干劲、忘我劳动的结果。农产品收购运动的实践也充分证明了：收购工作和群众运动相结合，采取大运动套小运动，长运动套短运动，突击收购和经常收购相结合，突击运输和经常运输相结合等收购办法是完全正确的。
    特别是最近以来，许多地区在农副产品收购工作中都认真地贯彻了党的六中全会决议的精神，收购工作做得更加踏实细致了：绝大部分地区对已经收起来的农产品都认真地做了清点、核实工作，并且清理了经济手续。所有这些情况都表明，农产品收购运动正在逐步展开和深入。
    目前农产品收购虽然已经取得了很大的成绩，但是和国家计划收购的任务比起来还有一段相当的距离。从现在到春节，还有不到一个月的时间。过了春节，广大农村就将忙于春耕生产。在农产品收购的最后阶段里，争取时间，在春节以前基本上把应该收购的农副产品全部收上来，这个任务仍然是很艰巨的。尤其是在农副产品收购任务完成较差的地区，进一步加强农副产品的收购工作仍然是当地党委和商业部门当前的中心任务之一。因为只有全部完成国家农副产品的收购计划，才能满足工业部门对农副产品原料的需要，满足广大群众对农副产品消费的需要；才能满足人民公社和广大社员出售农副产品的要求，使人民公社在出售农副产品以后，换回各种必需的生产资料和生活资料。因此，我们应该向广大基层干部宣传农副产品收购的巨大成绩，同时更要加强政治思想教育，使他们继续鼓足干劲，在最后这段时间内，大抓一下农副产品收购工作，特别要大抓一下棉花和油料的收购工作，全面完成国家收购计划。这样，不仅可以大大活跃城乡经济，而且为1959年工农业更大跃进准备必要的物质条件。
    力争在春节前完成农副产品收购任务的关键仍然在于收购工作要和群众运动相结合。但是，我们也要看到，随着收购工作的步步深入，工作任务也随着越来越复杂。这就要求我们在大搞群众运动的基础上把工作做得更加细致些。例如，随着棉花收购数量的增加，就带来了繁重的保管工作和加工问题。保管、加工工作如果跟不上去，就要影响收购的进度。这就需要妥善而又细致地解决仓容问题、包装工具问题、加工机器的维护和零件的修配问题。又如，要保证农产品的质量，就必须加强分等、验级工作。这些问题看起来似乎是小事情，但是如果忽略过去，就会使国家遭受损失。因此各地必须认真地解决这些问题。对于过去做得不够细致的地方，应该设法补救。河北省结合棉花收购工作，提出了“三找”即找落地花、僵瓣花（霜后结的棉花）和“眼睫毛（未摘净的棉花）”的运动，仅邯郸、石家庄两个专区在去年12月下旬就找回了三千万斤棉花。这种细致的作法是值得提倡的。总之，工作越做得细致，就越能够使收购运动顺利地进行，并取得切实的进展。
    目前各地农产品收购运动的发展是不平衡的：许多地区已经完成了收购计划，但是也有不少地区距离完成收购任务还差得很远；有些地区某些品种完成收购情况较好，但另外一些品种却完成得较差。这就需要区别不同情况提出不同的任务和要求。但是，不论是哪些地区，哪种情况，都应该用“两条腿”走路，具体地说来，就是：既要抓数量，又要抓质量；既要抓大宗农产品，又要抓小宗土副产品；既要抓“家生”产品，也要抓野生植物；既要抓收购，也要抓加工和调运。
    我们相信，只要各级党委加强对农副产品的统一领导和全面安排，密切结合整社工作，把广大干部的革命干劲和踏踏实实的作风紧密地结合起来，并且认真细致地处理收购环节中的各种具体问题，我们就一定能够在春节以前把应该收购的农副产品多快好足地收购起来。
