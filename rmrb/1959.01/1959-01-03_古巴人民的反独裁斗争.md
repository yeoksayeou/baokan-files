    The Cuban People's Struggle Against Dictatorship

    On New Year's Day 1959, the Cuban Batista dictatorship, fostered single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, declared its collapse. On this day, Batista, along with Agüero, who was preparing to assume the presidency in February of this year, as well as the current Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Batista regime, and dozens of high-ranking military and political officials, all fled abroad.

    Dictatorial Regime's Heinous Crimes

    Batista was a notorious dictator who ruled Cuba for a total of twenty-five years. He staged a coup in September 1933 and controlled the government as Chief of Staff of the Army for seven years. He served as president from 1940 to 1944. In 1944, the joint presidential candidate of four political parties, including the Cuban Socialist People's Party, won, ending Batista's rule. During the Cuban general election in 1952, Batista, with the support of the United States, once again launched a coup and came to power, remaining until his recent flight. After coming to power in 1952, Batista dissolved the parliament, abolished the constitution, formulated the reactionary "constitutional regulations" and anti-labor laws, deprived the people of their basic rights, and declared the Communist Party illegal. For several years, Cuba had been under martial law, and prisons were filled with arrested people. The Batista government forbade strikes, prohibited mass gatherings, and even residents' family gatherings and festival gatherings had to obtain prior permission from the Ministry of Interior. In foreign affairs, the regime consistently sided with the United States, signed a "military mutual assistance treaty" with the United States, and gave U.S. companies in Cuba tariff and tax preferential treatment in many ways, betraying national interests. Therefore, during Batista's reign, American monopoly enterprises were unprecedentedly active in Cuba.

    A Wealthy Island, a Suffering People

    Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies, with an area of 114,500 square kilometers and a population of approximately six million. Cuba has fertile land, and agriculture is the main productive activity of the Cuban people, with sugar cane being the main agricultural product. Cuba's sugar production and export volume rank first in the world, with sugar production accounting for 90% of the national income; sugar exports account for 85% of the total national exports. The reason why Cuba has become a single-crop country is mainly due to the result of the U.S. monopoly organizations' control over the country's economic life. Cuba also has abundant reserves of iron sand, manganese, nickel, copper, bauxite, and other strategic materials.

    The clutches of U.S. monopoly organizations control the entire economic life of the Cuban people. Although Cuba is small in area, it ranks third in the total amount of direct U.S. investment in Latin America, totaling more than one billion U.S. dollars, half of which was invested during Batista's rule. U.S. imperialism controls the sugar industry, which is the foundation of the Cuban economy, with the United States controlling more than 50% of the sugar refining capacity. Because the United States is almost the only market for Cuban sugar, it manipulates Cuban sugar prices and stipulates sugar import quotas. Other economic sectors in Cuba, such as electricity, transportation, and mining, are also controlled by U.S. monopoly organizations.

    The lives of the Cuban working people are miserable under the dual oppression of U.S. monopoly capital and the Cuban reactionaries. Currently, out of Cuba's six million population, there are 650,000 unemployed, and millions of peasants have no land and live at a low standard of living. Cuba also has one of the highest infant mortality rates and tuberculosis mortality rates in Latin America. Among residents under the age of fifteen, there are 820,000 illiterate people, and 40% of the rural population is illiterate.

    Anti-Dictatorship Movement in Full Swing

    The Cuban people could not tolerate Batista's tyranny and constantly carried out heroic struggles against the dictatorship. Participating in this struggle included a wide range of progressive and democratic forces of the Cuban people, and the forms of struggle were diverse, including armed struggle. The "July 26th Movement" and the rebel army led by Castro were the main force of the armed struggle.

    In December 1956, dozens of Cuban youths led by Castro, who were exiled in Mexico, landed in Oriente Province by boat and established a guerrilla base in the Sierra Maestra mountains in the southwest of the province, launching a guerrilla war. Regarding the fighting and political goals of this team, Castro once stated that the revolutionary movement he led was only a democratic and nationalist movement. He said that his goal was to overthrow Batista's dictatorship, release political prisoners, restore freedom of the press and constitutional rights, eradicate corruption, launch literacy campaigns, accelerate industrialization, implement land reform, and improve people's lives. Because the combat objective of the "July 26th Movement" was first to end the Cuban dictatorship and lay the foundation for the establishment of a truly representative government, it received the support of people from all walks of life in Cuba, as well as the strong support of the Socialist People's Party, and therefore this force quickly expanded into a fighting force with more than 10,000 people.

    The United States Supports the Dictatorial Regime

    In the storm of the Cuban people's struggle against the dictatorship, the reason why Batista was able to survive was mainly due to the full support of U.S. imperialism and the shameless interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The United States not only supplied Batista with weapons, but also stationed a military delegation in Cuba, directly commanding the Cuban government army to fight against the Cuban rebel army. According to American newspapers, at the end of January 1958, the U.S. State Department signed a secret agreement with Batista, attempting to prevent the Cuban rebel army from raising funds and arms in the United States. According to this agreement, the U.S. government arrested Castro's representative in New York, Angel Pérez, last August. The two U.S. naval bases in Caimanera and Guantánamo in Cuba played a role in directly supporting Batista's troops. At the end of July 1958, the United States threatened to send Marines to land in Cuba under the pretext of protecting the water source of the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo. This American attempt at aggression was forced to stop after being strongly opposed by the Cuban people and world opinion. Later, the United States, under the pretext of "protecting American property and American citizens," issued a statement threatening to "take measures" to deal with the rebel army and sent a fast offensive transport ship to Nicaro on the northeast coast of Cuba under the pretext of evacuating overseas Chinese.

    When the rebel army won successive victories, the U.S. imperialists had to worry that Batista's collapse would lead to a situation in Cuba that was unfavorable to the United States. In order to ensure U.S. interests in Cuba and further strengthen the plunder of Cuban wealth, the United States attempted to support another servant to replace the notorious Batista. This is the origin of the so-called Cuban general election on November 3, 1958. The various progressive parties and the rebel army in Cuba announced a boycott of this sham election, and the rebel army launched a fierce offensive. The United States and Batista妄想(wàngxiǎng, presumptuous attempt) to confuse the Cuban people with fake elections, but it further aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Cuban people.

    As the Cuban rebel army became stronger and stronger and the dictatorial regime was in imminent danger, the United States conspired to use the Organization of American States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. This conspiracy failed.

    However, no matter how the U.S. imperialists supported the Batista dictatorial regime, they could not save it from its doomed fate. The Cuban people finally overthrew Batista's dictatorial regime. (Mei [America])

    古巴人民的反独裁斗争
    1959年的元旦，由美帝国主义一手扶植的古巴的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权宣告垮台了。在这一天，巴蒂斯塔和准备在今年2月就任总统的阿古埃罗以及巴蒂斯塔政权的现任总理、外交部长、几十个高级军政大员都一起逃往国外。
    独裁政权恶贯满盈
    巴蒂斯塔是统治了古巴前后达二十五年的声名狼籍的独裁者。他曾于1933年9月举行政变，并以陆军参谋总长的身份控制了政府达七年之久。在1940—1944年期间，他出任总统。1944年，有古巴社会主义人民党参加的四个政党联合总统候选人得胜，结束了巴蒂斯塔的统治。在1952年古巴大选时，巴蒂斯塔在美国的支持下又一次发动政变上台直到他这次逃亡为止。巴蒂斯塔于1952年上台后，就解散议会，废除宪法，制订反动的“宪法条例”和反劳工法，剥夺了人民的基本权利，宣布共产党为非法。几年来，古巴全国一直处于戒严之中，监狱中挤满了被逮捕的人。巴蒂斯塔政府不准罢工，禁止群众集会，甚至居民家庭聚会和节日集会也须事先得到内政部的许可。在外交上，这个政权一贯投靠美国，同美国签订了“军事互助条约”，并在多方面给美国在古巴的公司以关税和捐税优惠待遇，出卖民族利益。因此在巴蒂斯塔执政期间，美国垄断企业在古巴空前活跃。
    富庶的岛国　苦难的人民
    古巴是西印度群岛中最大的一个岛，面积共十一万四千五百平方公里，人口约六百万。古巴土地肥沃，农业是古巴人民主要的生产活动，主要农产品是甘蔗。古巴的糖产量和输出量均占世界第一位，糖产量占国民收入的90％；糖的出口占全国出口总值的85％。古巴所以成为单一农作物的国家，主要是由于美国垄断组织对这个国家经济生活控制的结果。古巴的铁砂、锰、镍、铜、铁矾土和其他战略物资的储藏也很丰富。
    美国垄断组织的魔爪控制了古巴人民全部的经济生活。古巴面积虽小，但它在美国对拉丁美洲直接投资总数中却占第三位，总额达十亿美元以上，其中半数是在巴蒂斯塔统治期间投入的。美帝国主义控制了作为古巴经济基础的糖业，美国掌握了50％以上的制糖能力；由于美国几乎是古巴糖的唯一市场，所以它操纵了古巴的糖价并规定糖的入口定额。古巴其他经济部门如电力、交通运输、采矿也都为美国垄断组织所控制。
    古巴劳动人民的生活在美国垄断资本以及古巴反动派的双重压迫下，苦不堪言。目前，古巴六百万人口中有六十五万失业者，千千万万的农民没有土地，生活水平低下。古巴也是拉丁美洲婴儿死亡率及结核病死亡率最高的国家之一。在十五岁以下的居民中间文盲有八十二万人，40％的农村人口目不识丁。
    反独裁运动如火如荼
    古巴人民不能忍受巴蒂斯塔的暴政，不断地进行了反对独裁政权的英勇斗争。参加这一斗争的包括古巴人民的广泛的进步和民主力量，而且斗争的形式是多种多样的，包括武装斗争在内。卡斯特罗领导的“7月26日运动”和起义部队是武装斗争的主力。
    1956年12月，由卡斯特罗领导的流亡在墨西哥的几十个古巴青年乘船在奥连特省登陆，在该省西南的马埃斯特腊山区建立了游击根据地，展开了游击战争。关于这支队伍的战斗和政治目的，卡斯特罗曾经表示过，他所领导的起义运动只是民主主义和民族主义运动。他说他的目的是要推翻巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治、释放政治犯、恢复出版自由和宪法权利、铲除贪污现象、展开扫盲运动、加速工业化、实现土地改革、提高人民生活。由于“7月26
  日运动”的战斗目的首先是结束古巴的独裁制度，为建立一个真正的具有代表性的政府打下基础，因而得到古巴各阶层人民的支持，也得到社会主义人民党的大力支持，因而这支部队迅速扩展成为一支拥有一万多人的战斗力量。
    美国支持独裁政权
    在古巴人民反对独裁斗争的风暴中，巴蒂斯塔之所以能够苟延残喘，主要是由于美帝国主义的全力支持和对古巴内政的无耻干涉。美国不仅供给巴蒂斯塔武器，而且在古巴驻有军事代表团，直接指挥古巴政府军对古巴起义部队作战。据美国报刊报道，1958年1月底，美国国务院同巴蒂斯塔签订了一项秘密协定，企图阻止古巴起义部队在美国筹集款项和军火，根据这个协定，美国政府在去年8月逮捕了卡斯特罗在纽约的代表安吉尔·佩雷兹。美国在古巴的卡伊马内拉和关塔那摩两个海军基地则起着直接支援巴蒂斯塔部队的作用。1958年7月底，美国以保护关塔那摩的美国海军基地的水源为借口，威胁要派遣海军陆战队在古巴登陆。美国这一侵略企图，在遭到古巴人民和全世界舆论的强烈反对后被迫中止了。后来美国又借口“保护美国财产和美国公民”发表声明，威胁要“采取措施”来对付起义部队，并在撤退侨民的借口下，派出一艘快速进攻运输舰前往古巴东北海岸的尼卡罗。
    当起义部队接连获得胜利的时候，美帝国主义者不得不担心巴蒂斯塔的垮台将导致在古巴出现不利于美国的局面。为了确保美国在古巴的利益，进一步加强掠夺古巴财富，美国曾企图扶植另一个奴仆来代替臭名昭彰的巴蒂斯塔。这就是1958年11月3日的所谓古巴大选的由来。古巴各进步党派和起义部队都宣布对这个伪选进行抵制，起义部队并展开了猛烈攻势。美国和巴蒂斯塔妄想用假选举来迷惑古巴人民，但是却进一步激起了古巴广大人民的愤怒。
    在古巴起义军越战越强而独裁政权朝不保夕的情势下，美国又阴谋利用美洲国家组织来干涉古巴内政。这一阴谋并未能得逞。
    但是，不管美帝国主义怎样支持巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，都不能挽救它的崩溃的命运。古巴人民终于推翻了巴蒂斯塔的独裁政权。（美）
