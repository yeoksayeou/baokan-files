Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch: As Japan's "anti-mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party firmly opposes the "mainstream faction" led by Nobusuke Kishi's decision to hold an early election for party president, it decided today to nominate its own presidential candidate in order to confront Nobusuke Kishi should he forcibly convene a general meeting to elect the president ahead of schedule.

After frequent consultations, the leading figures of the "anti-mainstream faction," including Mitsujiro Ishii, Hayato Ikeda, Hideji Masutani, and Joji Hayashi, decided today to request the "mainstream faction" to conduct the election of the new president after March, when the term of the current party president expires. They also expressed firm opposition to the compromise proposal put forward by the "mainstream faction's" Banboku Oono, which would have the issue of electing the president decided by a general meeting of all members of the Liberal Democratic Party's House of Representatives and House of Councillors. The "anti-mainstream faction" stated that if the "mainstream faction" ignores this request and insists on holding a Liberal Democratic Party congress on January 24 to elect the president, then the "anti-mainstream faction" is prepared to nominate its own unified presidential candidate.

Hayato Ikeda told the press today that the "anti-mainstream faction" will formally announce its presidential candidate no later than January 21.

Yesterday, Hideji Masutani of the "anti-mainstream faction" also said to Nobusuke Kishi: "If you forcibly elect the president in January, something disgraceful will happen."

The aforementioned actions of the "anti-mainstream faction" are considered to be this faction's determination to counter the Nobusuke Kishi group's attempt to regain control of the Liberal Democratic Party's leadership by holding an early election of the president before the "anti-mainstream faction" is fully prepared. Kyodo News Agency said: "The struggle between the 'mainstream faction' and the 'anti-mainstream faction' over the issue of electing the president has become increasingly acute."

At a meeting held today, the "mainstream faction" of the Nobusuke Kishi group still decided to forcibly elect the party president on January 24. In addition, the "mainstream faction" also established the "Consultative Office on the Issue of Electing the President" on the 17th, and Nobusuke Kishi's confidants, centered on Masajiro Kawashima, have begun preparations for the election of the president.

    日本执政党内讧加剧
    岸信介集团提前重选总裁的决定受到反击
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党内的“反主流派”在坚决反对以岸信介为首的“主流派”关于提前选举党总裁的决定的同时，今天决定提出它自己的总裁候选人，以便在一旦岸信介强行提前召开选举总裁的大会时同岸信介进行对抗。
    “反主流派”的石井光次郎、池田勇人、益谷秀次、林让治等领导人物在进行了频繁的商谈以后，今天决定要求“主流派”在现任党的总裁任期届满的三月以后进行新总裁的选举，并且表示坚决反对“主流派”的大野伴睦提出的自由民主党的参众两院议员全体会议来决定选举总裁问题的妥协方案。“反主流派”表示，如果“主流派”对这个要求置之不理，硬要在1月24日召开自由民主党的大会选举总裁，那么，“反主流派”就准备提出它自己的统一的总裁候选人。
    池田勇人今天向新闻界发表谈话时说，“反主流派”最迟将在1月21日正式宣布它的总裁候选人。
    昨天，“反主流派”的益谷秀次还对岸信介说：“如果在1月强行选举总裁的话，将会发生丢脸的事情”。
    “反主流派”的上述行动，被认为是日本执政党内的这个派系决心反击岸信介集团想要乘“反主流派”还没有准备充分之前通过提前选举总裁来重新控制自由民主党的领导权的企图。共同社说：“主流派”和“反主流派”围绕选举总裁问题而展开的斗争已经日益尖锐。
    岸信介集团的“主流派”在今天举行的会议上，仍然决定要在1月24日强行选举党的总裁。此外，
  “主流派”还在17日成立了“选举总裁问题座谈会”办事处，以川岛正次郎为中心的岸信介的亲信已经开始进行选举总裁的准备工作。
