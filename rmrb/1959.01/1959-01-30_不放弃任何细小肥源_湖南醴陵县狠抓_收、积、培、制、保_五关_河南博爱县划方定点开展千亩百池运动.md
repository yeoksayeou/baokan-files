    Xinhua News Agency report: Hunan Province's Liling County, after communization, further developed and promoted the experience of "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" in accumulating fertilizer, based on the characteristics of the People's Communes being large and public. By seizing the five key links of "collection, accumulation, cultivation, production, and preservation" and combining the rush to accumulate fertilizer with regular accumulation, they have achieved great results. To date, the county has accumulated and produced various fertilizers averaging about 400 dan per mu.

    Liling's "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" fertilizer accumulation experience is: diligent sweeping, diligent bedding, diligent removing, diligent burning; cattle have pens, pigs have sties, ashes have sheds, manure has pools, people have toilets, chickens and ducks have roosts, there are manure pits for all seasons, and there is green manure in the fields. After last autumn, the Liling County Party Committee instructed all localities that they must continue to promote the "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" fertilizer accumulation experience, do a good job in collecting household fertilizer, accumulate more soil fertilizer, cultivate green manure well, produce chemical fertilizer, and pay attention to fertilizer preservation at all times, based on the new situation after communization.

    The various communes conscientiously implemented the instructions of the county Party committee and grasped the collection of household fertilizer from the very beginning. Previously, household fertilizer was generally collected through the allocation of tasks and reasonable adjustments to household fertilizer prices. After communization, the situation was different. After the implementation of a system combining wages and supply, if management and operation did not keep up, members would be busy with work and neglect accumulating household fertilizer. Under these circumstances, the various communes strengthened their leadership over fertilizer accumulation management, appropriately renovated the original livestock pens, and immediately added any that were insufficient, ensuring that every livestock had a pen and a manure pool next to the pen. In order to encourage the keepers to diligently bed the pens and produce more manure, while implementing the feeding responsibility system, they also stipulated the monthly manure output for yellow cattle, water buffalo, large pigs, small pigs, boars, and sows respectively, which was the responsibility of the keepers, with rewards for exceeding the quota, thus improving the keepers' enthusiasm. Chickens and ducks were required to have roosts, with the publicly raised ones having roosts built by the feeding farms and canteens, and the privately raised ones having roosts built by the members in residential areas or near their homes. Privately raised poultry manure fertilizer was generally priced according to quality and purchased at a discounted price, so members had a great enthusiasm for accumulating household fertilizer.

    After the collectivization of life, all localities established public toilets, roadside toilets, and temporary toilets at construction sites, and organized dedicated personnel to comprehensively collect feces and urine once every half month or ten days. Large composting pits are a large and high-quality source of organic fertilizer. Originally, almost every household in Liling County had a manure pit. In order to consolidate and develop this fertilizer accumulation experience, many production teams in Wangxian, Sifen, and other communes, in addition to preserving the original manure pits, also opened new large pits near canteens and residential areas to store the collected sewage and ash to compost mother fertilizer, generally producing four times a year. While vigorously grasping household manure pits, all localities also grasped field composting pits, using weeds, rice stalks, and sod, adding human and animal manure, tea seed cake, etc. to help fermentation, composting on the spot, and using on the spot, which saved labor and had good quality. The county has dug a total of more than 260,000 large ditches along the fields, estimated to produce more than 80 million dan of ditch fertilizer.

    In order to increase ash fertilizer, all localities grasped hoeing grass, sweeping fallen leaves, and burning a large amount of fire-soil ash and using cow dung to compost ash fertilizer, solving the difficulty of insufficient ash fertilizer.

    All localities have tightly grasped the cultivation of green manure. Generally, drainage ditches have been dug in all green manure fields in the county, and 70% of the green manure fields have been top-dressed with insulation fertilizer. Now, the green manure is growing very well and is several inches high.

    In addition, all localities have also grasped the key to finding ore and improving technology, and carried out the production of native chemical fertilizer. In the production of chemical fertilizer, Banshan Commune has improved tools and innovated technology, and has produced 750 tons of native chemical fertilizer. More than 500 furnaces in the county have produced more than 490,000 dan of native chemical fertilizer.

    In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, all localities have truly achieved diligent bedding, diligent removing, diligent sweeping, and diligent burning. In fertilizer preservation, they have achieved cattle having pens, pigs having sties, chickens and ducks having roosts, people having toilets, ashes having sheds, manure having pools, green manure in the fields, and manure pits everywhere.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bo'ai County, Henan Province, launched a vigorous thousand-acre hundred-pond fertilizer accumulation movement. After unified planning, area delineation, and spot designation, the county has now built 12,852 field thatched ponds, and 70,000 mu of cultivated land has achieved the requirement of a thousand acres per hundred ponds. Of the 200,000 mu of wheat fields in the county, 90% have been top-dressed for the first time, half of which is grass pond fertilizer, generally 30 dan per mu, equivalent to 10,000 jin of grass fertilizer. Not only is the fertilizer effect good, but the fertilizer transportation distance is also short, saving a lot of labor. The wheat seedlings that have been fertilized are growing very vigorously.

    There are many benefits to building thatched ponds in the fields: it can improve the fertilizer effect, the fertilizer source is sufficient, water, grass manure, and human and animal manure are mixed and fermented in winter, and green grass is accumulated and composted in summer and autumn; it saves manpower, and the fertilizer is applied without leaving the plot; the thatched pond fertilizer is composted quickly, and there is more nitrogen.

    The accumulation of fertilizer in field thatched ponds must also be combined with fertilizer preservation. Bo'ai County has taken five measures in management: thatched ponds are fixed with dedicated personnel responsible; a quota system and an over-quota reward system are implemented to ensure diligent fertilizer removal, diligent grass replacement, and timely application to the land after the thatched pond fertilizer is composted; a inspection system is established; a thatched pond fertilizer accumulation competition is launched; and the thatched pond is kept constantly filled with water and prevented from being washed away by heavy rain. After the above management methods were promoted throughout the county, they all achieved good results.

    The county's thousand-acre hundred-pond movement has recently seen new developments. The Xiying People's Commune created a continuous five-pond thatched pond high-temperature fertilizer accumulation method, that is, a large pot is placed under the thatched pond, and the five manure ponds are interconnected. After increasing the heat, a pond of fertilizer can be composted in three to five days in winter. This method is currently being promoted.

    不放弃任何细小肥源
    湖南醴陵县狠抓“收、积、培、制、保”五关
    河南博爱县划方定点开展千亩百池运动
    本报讯　湖南省醴陵县在公社化以后，根据人民公社又大又公的特点，进一步发展和推广了“四勤八有”的积肥经验，抓住“收、积、培、制、保”五个关键，将突击积肥与经常积肥结合起来，成绩很大。到目前为止，全县已积制各种肥料平均每亩达四百担左右。
    醴陵的“四勤八有”积肥经验是勤扫、勤垫、勤出、勤烧；牛有栏、猪有圈、灰有屋、粪有池、人有厕所、鸡鸭有埘、四季有粪凼、田里有绿肥。去年秋后，醴陵县委就指示各地，必须根据公社化后的新形势，继续推广“四勤八有”的积肥经验，做好收集家肥，多积土肥，培育好绿肥，制造化肥，随时注意保肥等工作。
    各个公社认真贯彻了县委的指示，一开始就抓住了收集家肥。以前，家肥一般是通过分配任务与合理调整家肥价格等办法收集起来的。公社化以后，情况不同了，实行工资制和供给制相结合的制度以后，经营管理如不赶上去，社员会忙于出工，忽视积家肥。在这种情况下，各个公社加强了对积肥经营管理工作的领导，适当修整原有的牲畜栏圈，不足的立即添设，做到头头牲畜有圈栏，圈栏边旁有粪池。为使饲养员勤垫栏多出粪，各地在贯彻饲养责任制的同时，还分别黄牛、水牛、大猪小猪、公猪母猪，规定每月出粪数量，由饲养员负责保管，超额奖励，这样提高了饲养员的积极性。鸡鸭做到有埘，公养的由饲养场与食堂建埘，私养的由社员在居民点或住宅附近建埘。私养的家禽粪肥，一般按质论价，折价收买，因此社员积家肥的劲头很足。
    生活集体化后，各地都建立了公共厕所、路边厕所、工地临时厕所，并组织专人半月或十天全面收集粪尿一次。大沤凼肥，是量多质好的有机肥源。原来醴陵全县基本上户户有粪凼，为巩固发展这一积肥经验，王仙、泗汾等公社许多生产队除保存了原有粪凼外，还在食堂和居民点附近新开大凼，用来贮放收集的污水和灰屑沤母肥，一般一年出四次。在大抓家粪凼的同时，各地都抓住了田间沤凼，利用杂草、禾兜、草皮，并加进人畜粪尿、茶枯等帮助发酵，就地沤制，就地使用，既省工质量又好。全县共已挖田边大凼二十六万多个，估计能出凼粪八千多万担。
    为了增加灰肥，各地抓住了锄草皮，扫落叶，大量烧制火土灰和用牛粪堆沤成灰肥，解决了灰肥不足的困难。
    各地对培育绿肥抓得很紧，全县绿肥田一般都开好了排水沟，并有70％的绿肥田已追施了保温肥料。现在，绿肥长得很好，都有几寸高了。
    此外，各地还抓住了找矿石、改进技术等关键，开展了土化肥生产。板杉公社在制化肥中，由于改进工具，革新技术，已生产土化肥七百五十吨。全县五百多个炉子，共生产出土化肥四十九万多担。
    各地在积肥运动中，真正做到了勤垫、勤出、勤扫、勤烧。在保肥上，做到了牛有栏、猪有圈、鸡鸭有埘、人有厕所、灰有屋、粪有池、田中有绿肥、处处有粪凼。
    据新华社讯　河南博爱县群众开展轰轰烈烈的千亩百池积肥运动。全县经过统一规划、划方定点，现在已打田间茅池一万二千八百五十二个，有七万亩耕地已经实现了千亩百池的要求。全县二十万亩麦田，有90％已施了头遍追肥，其中一半是草池肥，每亩一般上三十担，相等于上草肥一万斤，不仅肥效好，运肥路程也短，节省很多劳力。上过肥的麦苗，生长都很茂密茁壮。
    修田间茅池的好处很多：可以提高肥效，肥源足，冬天用水、草粪、人粪尿混合发酵，夏秋天用青草积沤；节约人力，上肥不出地块；茅池沤粪沤得快，氮质多。
    田间茅池的积肥还必须和保肥相结合，博爱县在管理上采取了五个措施：茅池固定专人负责；实行定额制和超额奖励制，保证勤出肥，勤换草，茅池肥沤成后及时上地；建立检查制度；开展茅池积肥竞赛；保持茅池经常有水和防止大雨冲刷。以上管理办法在全县推广后，都收到了良好效果。
    这个县的千亩百池运动最近又有了新的发展。西英人民公社创造了一连五的茅池高温积肥法，就是在茅池的下边盘一个大锅，五个粪池互相连通，加高热后，在冬季三、五天就可以沤成一池肥。这种办法目前正在推广。
