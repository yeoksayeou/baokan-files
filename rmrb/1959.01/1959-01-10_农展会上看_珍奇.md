Seeing "Rare and Unusual" at the Agricultural Exhibition

Xinhua News Agency reporter Su Qun, Xu Shijie

In addition to showcasing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in 1958, this Agricultural Exhibition also displays many amazing new things created by the masses of farmers.

The Agricultural Exhibition features many "Kings." Among them, the "Rice King" and "Wheat King" are the leaders of the grain kings. In the grain room, a "Chimi Nian" sent from Fujian Province has a particularly high tillering rate, growing ninety-eight ears, with an average of more than one hundred and fifty grains per ear. It is estimated that it can produce about one jin of rice. Another "Rice King" in the comprehensive hall was cultivated by Zhang Chunting, a seed selection model from Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province. This plant is five feet tall, with an ear length of one foot and seven hundred and forty grains per ear. A rice plant named "Thousand Grain Seed" in the seed room is a new hybrid variety cultivated by Zeng Xuchang, a technician at Chenghai Farm in Guangdong Province, with more than nine hundred grains per ear. There are also many "Wheat Kings." A plant sent from Shaanxi Province has one hundred and fourteen ears, with more than four thousand five hundred grains. There are also "Wheat Kings" with more than one hundred ears sent from Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places.

Corn and millet also have "Kings." They are all tall and strong, with large ears and many seeds. The "Corn King" comes from Hebei and Shaanxi. A corn plant in Shaanxi Province is more than ten feet tall and bears nine cobs, each cob like a mallet. Another "Corn King" selected from the province has cobs more than one foot long and weighs one jin and ten liang. The "Millet King" exhibited here from Shaanxi Province has an ear length of one foot and nine and a half inches, like a long braid, three or four times longer than ordinary millet ears. The multi-eared sorghum from Hebei Province can tiller in many ways, with many ears and high yield.

Among the root crops, the "Liantai Yam King" sent from Yunnan Province weighs three hundred and seventy-four jin, thirty times larger than ordinary yams. The "Sweet Potato King" sent from Guangdong Province weighs more than one hundred and sixty jin, like a litter of chubby and lovely piglets. At the previous National Agricultural Exhibition, the large sweet potatoes exhibited weighed only forty-three jin per hill, and even the largest ones weighed only a little over one hundred and ten jin.

There were also many "Kings" produced in cotton in 1958. Exhibits include those from Hebei, Anhui, Sichuan, and Hubei. In particular, the two "Cotton Kings" from Hebei and Hubei each have more than three hundred large cotton bolls, looking like jade trees covered in silver flowers. A long-staple cotton plant cultivated by the South China Agricultural Research Institute in Guangdong Province bears more than one hundred and eighty bolls. The cotton of this long-staple cotton is particularly long and is a good raw material for spinning high-count yarns.

The "Soybean Kings" from Shandong and Henan are each more than ten feet tall, with branches full of strings of bean pods. The labels indicate that each plant has more than one thousand and two hundred pods. The "Peanut King" from Hubei Province named "Hong'an Upright" bears more than nine hundred and twenty peanut fruits per hole. The two "Rape Kings" sent from Jiangsu Province and Sichuan Province are taller than people, and three people are needed to hug them. They all bear more than ten thousand pods, with high seed yields of more than six jin and low yields of more than four jin. The "Sesame King" from Henan Province is five feet and five inches tall and bears five hundred and ninety-one capsules.

Special high-yielding economic crops are even more dazzling. The "Sugarcane King" sent by the Hongqi Commune in the suburbs of Shantou City, Guangdong Province, has thirty-five plants in one hole, resembling a bamboo forest, weighing six hundred and forty-five jin. It is said that this one hole can produce seventy or eighty jin of sugar. The tobacco leaves sent from Henan, Yunnan, and Hebei provinces are almost touching the roof. Here, there are also large Yunnan taros that are more than half a person tall and weigh more than thirty jin; large Shandong cabbages weighing more than fifty jin; large Gansu pumpkins weighing one hundred and twenty jin that require two people to lift; seven-foot-long Guizhou cowpeas; large Henan winter melons weighing eighty-five jin; Fujian orange trees that bear more than four hundred oranges just four years after cultivation; a Jilin "Ginseng King" weighing twenty-two liang and thirty-seven years old; a large Poria weighing more than one hundred and seventy jin; an eleven-jin Qinghai "Rhubarb"; a Gansu maral antler velvet (i.e., deer antler) weighing one hundred and forty-six liang; and shiny purple Ganoderma lucidum from Tianshui, Gansu.

The treasures of animal husbandry and aquaculture are also dazzling. The "Nongda Black" hen cultivated by Beijing Agricultural University is also very famous. The eggs laid by "Nongda Black" are exhibited here. The large ones are really large, weighing more than three liang. People who do not read the description easily mistake them for small goose eggs.

There are also rice growing on reed stems, potatoes growing on sunflower roots, and new varieties that bear both eggplants and tomatoes. There are even more creations in terms of agricultural tools, indigenous fertilizers, and indigenous pesticides. These achievements have left many scientists dumbfounded.

People have seen apples growing on trees, but now there is a pumpkin from Shandong exhibited here that also bears four large apples, looking the same as those growing on trees. This is the creation of Wang Lizhi of the Shandong Provincial Horticultural Research Institute.

There is also a kind of "sorghum rice," with ears shaped like sorghum, but the grains on the ears are rice. This was cultivated by Zhou Hanhua, a farmer and seed selector from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. The male parent he used for cultivation was sorghum, and the female parent was white glutinous rice. This sorghum rice has large ears with many grains, developed roots, and thick stems, making it difficult to lodge.

The "Sorghum Millet" cultivated by Yan You of the Hexing Management District in Suiping County, Henan Province, exhibited in the Culture and Health Hall, has ears shaped like cattails and grains like millet, and tastes sweet and sticky. This was cultivated by grafting millet and sorghum. Although it has not yet been finalized, it reflects the new style of farmers who dare to think and dare to do.

All of this reflects the great victory achieved by Chinese farmers in exploring the secrets of nature during the Great Leap Forward. It reflects that while creating unprecedented large-scale harvests, Chinese farmers have also explored the secrets of the inherent potential of various crops. Although the yields of those single "Rice Kings," "Rape Kings," etc., are not the decisive factor in the agricultural bumper harvest of 1958—the decisive factor is still the large-scale high-yield of close planting—they illustrate that with intensive cultivation and careful breeding, the potential for increased production of various crops is surprisingly high.

    农展会上看“珍奇”
    新华社记者　苏群　徐士杰
    这次农展会上，除了展出1958年农业大跃进的成果以外，还展出了令人惊异的农民群众所创造的许多新东西。
    农展会上展出了很多“王”。其中，“水稻王”、“小麦王”是五谷众王之首。在粮食室里，福建省送展的一株“赤米粘”，分蘖率特别高，长了九十八个穗，平均每穗有一百五十多粒，据估计可产一斤左右稻谷。另一株“水稻王”在综合馆里，是浙江省嘉兴县选种模范张春庭培育的。这株秆高五尺，穗长一尺，每穗七百四十粒。而在种子室的一株名“千粒种”的水稻，是广东省澄海农场技术员曾叙长培育的一个杂交新品种，每穗有九百多粒。“小麦王”也很多。陕西省送来的一株有一百一十四个穗，四千五百多粒。像这样一株百穗以上的“小麦王”，还有新疆、青海等地送展的。
    玉米、谷子也有“王”。它们都身材魁伟、穗大籽多。“玉米王”有河北的，也有陕西的。陕西省一株玉米有一丈多高，结了九个棒子，个个棒子都像棒槌一样。该省选展的另一个“玉米王”，棒子长一尺多，重一斤十两。这里展出的来自陕西省的“谷子王”，穗长一尺九寸五，像一根长辫子一样，它比一般谷穗长三、四倍。河北省的多穗高粱，一株能分多蘖，穗很多，产量高。
    薯类中有云南送展的“莲台薯大王”，一个重三百七十四斤，比一般的大三十倍。广东送展的“甘薯王”，一墩重一百六十多斤，像一窝肥胖可爱的小猪一样。而在上届全国农展会上展出的大甘薯，一墩只有四十三斤重，就是最大的也不过一百一十多斤重。
                              ＊
    1958年棉花出的“王”也不少。展出的有河北的、安徽的、四川的和湖北的。特别是来自河北和湖北的两株“棉花王”，每株都有三百多个大棉桃，看去银花累累，宛如玉树琼枝。广东省华南农业研究所培育的一株长绒棉，结桃一百八十多个，这种长绒棉的棉绒特别长，是纺高支纱的好原料。
    山东、河南来的“大豆王”，身高各有一丈多，枝上挂满了一串串豆荚，说明牌上标明，它们每棵都有一千二百多个荚。湖北省名叫“红安直立”的“花生王”，一穴结花生果九百二十多个。江苏省和四川省送来的两株“油菜王”，株比人高，三个人才能合抱过来。它们都结了一万多荚，产籽高的六斤多，低的也有四斤多。河南省来的“芝麻王”，有五尺五寸高，结五百九十一个蒴果。
    经济作物的特大丰产棵更是琳琅满目。广东省汕头市郊红旗公社送来的“甘蔗王”，一穴三十五棵，形似竹林，有六百四十五斤。据说，就这一穴就能产糖七、八十斤。河南、云南、河北省送来的烟叶，株高几乎顶着屋顶。这里，还有半人多高、三十多斤重的云南大芋头；有五十多斤重的山东大白菜，有两个人才抬得动的一百二十斤的甘肃大南瓜；有七尺长的贵州大豆角；有八十五斤重的河南大冬瓜；有刚栽培四年就结桔四百多个的福建省桔树；有体重二十二两、长了三十七年的吉林“参王”，有一百七十多斤的大茯苓，有十一斤重的青海“大黄”，有重一百四十六两的甘肃马鹿锯茸（即鹿角），还有甘肃天水来的紫光闪闪的灵芝草。
    畜牧业和水产业的珍品也是光彩夺目，北京农业大学培育的“农大黑”母鸡，也很出名。这里展出了“农大黑”下的蛋，大的真大，重三两还多，不看说明的人，很容易把它当作小鹅蛋。
    这里还有芦竹上长的水稻，向日葵根上长的马铃薯，又结茄子又结西红柿的新品种。至于农具、土化肥、土农药方面的创造就更多了。这些成就使许多科学家们都看得目瞪口呆。
    人们都见过树上结的苹果，可是现在这里展出的山东的一个南瓜，也结了四个大苹果，看起来和树上结的一样。这是山东省园艺科学研究所的王立治的创造。
    还有一种“高粱稻谷”，穗形像高粱，穗上结的籽粒却是稻谷。这是广东省新会县农民选种家周汉华培育的。他培育用的父本是高粱，母本是白粘稻。这种高粱稻谷，穗大粒多，根系发达，茎粗壮，不易倒伏。
    文教卫生馆展出的河南省遂平县和兴管理区阎友培育的“高粱谷”，穗形像蒲棒，籽粒像谷子，吃起来又甜又粘，这是用谷子和高粱嫁接培育出来的。它虽然还未定型，却反映了农民敢想敢干的新风格。
    所有这一切，都反映了大跃进中的我国农民，在探索自然秘密上所取得的伟大胜利。反映出我国农民创造出空前未有的大面积丰收的同时，也探索了各种作物内在潜力的秘密。那些单株的“水稻王”、“油菜王”等等的产量，虽然不是1958年农业大丰收的决定因素——决定因素还是密植的大面积的丰产，但是它们说明了精耕细作、精心培育，各种作物增产潜力都大得惊人。
