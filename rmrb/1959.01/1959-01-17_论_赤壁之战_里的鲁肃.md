    On Lu Su in the "Battle of Red Cliffs"
    Liu Mianzhi

    In 208 AD, when Liu Biao of Jingzhou died, Lu Su suggested offering condolences and observing the situation, even though the Sun and Liu families had a long-standing feud. At this time, Liu Bei had just been defeated and was residing in Jingzhou. He believed that if Liu Bei could unite with Liu Biao's two sons, they should form an alliance with Liu Bei to jointly resist Cao Cao; if the situation was the opposite, they should make other plans. It was also necessary to act first to avoid being preempted by Cao Cao. Unexpectedly, Lu Su had only reached Xiakou when Cao Cao was already heading towards Jingzhou. Lu Su traveled day and night and only reached Nan Commandery to find that Liu Biao's son, Liu Cong, had already surrendered to Cao Cao. Liu Bei was helpless. Lu Su seized the opportunity to persuade him to join forces with Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. Liu Bei agreed and sent Zhuge Liang as his representative to discuss the matter with Sun Quan. Lu Su's goal was achieved. From this, it can be seen that before Cao Cao took Jingzhou, Lu Su had already decided to form a military alliance with Liu Bei, and he also tried to gain time and race against Cao Cao's army. Although he was unable to prevent Liu Cong from surrendering, he managed to win over Liu Bei in time, strategically strengthening his own forces and taking the initiative. In the Battle of Red Cliffs, he was a decision-maker and the leader of the resolute pro-war faction.

    Lu Su returned to report, and Cao Cao declared his intention to move east, sending a threatening letter. Sun Quan's advisors all advocated surrender, but only Lu Su opposed it. At this time, Zhou Yu was on a mission to Poyang. Lu Su persuaded Sun Quan to recall Zhou Yu and appoint him as commander-in-chief, with Lu Su as the Zan Jun Xiaowei (Chief of Staff), and they defeated Cao Cao.

    Liu Bei requested to govern Jingzhou. Lu Su strongly advised Sun Quan, pointing out the disparity in strength: Jiangdong was weaker than Cao Cao; Cao Cao had just occupied Jingzhou and had not yet consolidated his position; it was best to let Liu Bei occupy it and establish a base. In this way, Cao Cao would have one more enemy, while they would have one more ally, which was the best policy. Although there were conflicts between the Sun and Liu families, they were ultimately secondary. This was the most far-sighted strategy under the specific circumstances at the time. If the previous stage of Lu Su's alliance with Liu to resist Cao was the first step towards the tripartite division, then the lending of Jingzhou was the second step in laying the foundation for the tripartite situation.

    Analyzing the situation at the end of the Han Dynasty and Lu Su's class background, we can understand the reasoning behind the pro-war stance of the Jiangdong ministers.

    First, in the peasant uprisings at the end of the Han Dynasty, during the military struggles where landlords' estates were besieged everywhere, the large landlords in various places, in order to preserve their families' property and lives, organized armed forces, distributed wealth to gather retainers, and used military law to force small and medium landlords and young peasants and tenant farmers into their private armies to confront the rebel armies. When the balance of military power changed and they could no longer withstand it, they sought refuge with larger military leaders for protection. Cao Cao, Liu Bei, Sun Jian and his sons, and others were the largest military leaders at the time, and their generals were mostly landlords' armed leaders with private armies. The sustenance of the private armies was supplied by bestowed fiefs, and under normal circumstances, they were inherited by their descendants. The situation of the counselors was different; they brought their family retainers, but they did not necessarily have private armies.

    Lu Su, Zhou Yu, Huang Gai, and other military officials were all landlords' armed leaders with private armies. They opposed the peasant uprisings and also opposed Cao Cao's unification, because the result of unification would inevitably damage their economic and political status in the local area. Conversely, if Jiangdong established an independent state, they could not only maintain their original status but also develop and grow stronger. Therefore, their interests were consistent with the interests of the Sun Quan family.

    When Sun Quan convened a meeting of his generals, Lu Su spoke to Sun Quan alone: "Someone like me can surrender, but you cannot, because if I surrender, I can still become a low-ranking official under Cao Cao, and gradually rise to the position of governor or administrator. But where would you go?" It seemed that he was thinking for Sun Quan, but in fact, he was also talking about himself. Clearly, if they did not surrender, people like Lu Su were at the top of the ruling group in Jiangdong; if they surrendered, they could only become minor officials like those of the "Lower Cao," subject to manipulation.

    Second, in order to preserve the interests of the landlord class ruling group headed by Sun and Liu, the only way out at the time was to form an alliance against Cao. Lu Su and Zhou Yu held the same view, and so did Zhuge Liang. This shared view was due to the convergence of class interests and the lessons learned from the practical struggles of the time. Wang Fuzhi provided a good explanation of this point in his "Readings on the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government":

        In the struggles among the heroes at the end of the Han Dynasty, what was the reason for Cao Cao's success in挟(coerce) the Emperor and crushing enemies on all sides?
        The reason lies in the mutual destruction among the heroes, their inability to unite.
        Lü Bu was fickle, changing sides constantly, and everyone hated him; Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao were divided; Yuan Shao was also in opposition to Gongsun Zan; Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang, brothers, killed each other; Han Sui and Ma Chao suspected each other; although Liu Biao communicated with Yuan Shao, he sat idly by and did not save Yuan Shao from defeat. In this way, the heroes destroyed each other, giving Cao Cao the opportunity to win.
        In the end, only the Sun and Liu families remained. If these two families were to seek conflict with each other again, the future would be clear: either internal collapse or destruction by Cao Cao.

    Lu Su and Zhuge Liang befriended each other, determined a plan, and joined forces to resist Cao Cao, vying with Cao Cao for their own survival. This was the only possible way out under the circumstances at the time. (To be continued)

    论“赤壁之战”里的鲁肃
    刘勉之
    公元208年，荆州刘表死，虽然孙刘两家有世仇，鲁肃建议吊丧，观察形势。这时刘备新败，寄寓荆州。他认为如刘备能和刘表二子团结一致，便该和刘备结盟，共拒曹操，如情况相反，另作打算。还必需先走一步，免得被曹操走到前头。不料鲁肃才到夏口，曹操已向荆州，鲁肃连夜赶路，才到南郡，刘表子刘琮已经投降曹操，刘备正没办法，鲁肃乘机劝他和孙权联兵共同抵抗曹操。刘备很赞成，派诸葛亮作代表到孙权处商议其事，鲁肃的目的达到了。由此可见鲁肃在曹操取荆州之前，已经定计，和刘备结成军事联盟，并且还努力争取时间，和曹军赛跑，虽然没有能够阻止刘琮投降，却及时地争取了刘备，在战略上壮大了自己的力量，取得了主动。在赤壁战役中，他是一个决策的人物，是坚决主战派的首领。
    鲁肃回来复命，曹操声言东下，来信恐吓，孙权的谋臣都主张投降，只有鲁肃反对。这时周瑜出使鄱阳，鲁肃劝孙权追还周瑜，拜为都督，鲁肃作赞军校尉（参谋长），大破曹操。
    刘备要求都督荆州，鲁肃极力劝说孙权，指出力量对比，江东不如曹操；曹操初占荆州，还没有巩固；正好让刘备占领，安下家业。这样，曹操多一敌人，自己却多一盟军，最为上策。虽然，孙刘两家也有矛盾，但毕竟是次要的。这是在当时具体形势下，最有远见的策略，假如说，前一阶段鲁肃联刘拒曹是三国分立的第一步，那末，借荆州就是奠定三分之局的第二步。
    分析汉末形势和鲁肃的阶级出身，可以看出江东群臣中，武臣主战的道理。
    第一，在汉末农民大起义，到处都围攻地主庄园的军事斗争中，各地的大地主为了保全自己的家业生命，都组织了武装力量，散财结士，把中小地主和青壮年农民、佃客用军法勒为部曲，和起义军对抗。在军事力量对比发生变化支持不了的时候，就投奔更大的军事首领，求得庇护。三国曹操、刘备、孙坚父子等是当时最大的军事首领，他们的部将大都是带有部曲的地主武装首领。部曲的给养由赏赐的奉邑供应，一般的情况下是由子孙继承的。谋议之臣情况不同，带着家族门客，却不一定都有部曲。
    鲁肃、周瑜、黄盖等武臣都是有部曲的地主武装首领。他们反抗农民起义，同样，也反对曹操的统一。因为统一的结果必然要损害他们在当地的经济和政治地位。相反，江东独立建国，他们不但可以保持原来的地位，还可以发展壮大。因之，他们的利益和孙权家族的利益是一致的。
    鲁肃在孙权召集诸将会议时，和孙权单独谈话：“像我这样人可以投降，你就不可以，因为我如降了，还可作下曹从事，累官可到州郡。你呢？到那儿去？”好像是替孙权设想的，其实，这话也正是说他自己，很明显，不降，鲁肃这类人在江东是统治集团最上层的人物，降呢，只能作下曹从事这类小官，听任摆布了。
    第二，为了保全以孙、刘为首的地主阶级统治集团的利益，当时的唯一出路是联盟抗曹。鲁肃、周瑜的看法一致，诸葛亮的看法也是如此。这种相同的看法，由于阶级利益的一致，也由于当时的斗争实际的教训。关于这一点，王夫之在读通鉴论中有很好的说明。他说：
        在汉末群雄的斗争中，曹操挟天子，粉碎四
    面的敌人，成功的道理何在？
        道理在群雄的自相诛灭，不能团结。
        吕布反复，忽彼忽此，谁都恨他；袁术和袁
    绍分立；袁绍又和公孙瓒对立；袁谭袁尚兄弟相
    残杀；韩遂和马超相疑；刘表虽通袁绍，却坐视
    袁绍之败而不救。这样，群雄自相诛灭，给曹操
    以胜利的机会。
        结果，只剩下孙权、刘备两家了。这两家如
    再自寻干戈，前途就很清楚，不是内部崩溃就是为曹操所灭。
    鲁肃和诸葛亮结交定计，合力抗曹，是和曹操争自身存亡，是当时情况下，唯一可能的出路。（续完）
