Xinhua News Agency, January 26th. Indian Ambassador to China, Parthasarathi, held a grand reception in Beijing this evening to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other state leaders of our country attended the reception.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception, and on behalf of the Chinese government and people, he extended warm congratulations to the government and people of our friendly neighbor. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi focused on the great victories continuously achieved by the worldwide people's movement for peace and the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence. The Chinese people sincerely hope for the common economic development of Asian and African countries and praised the further development of the profound friendship between China and India.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Over the past nine years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nehru, the Republic of India has made great progress in building its own country and developing its national economy. Three years ago, India completed its first Five-Year Plan. At present, the Indian government is taking various active measures to strive for the realization of the ambitious Second Five-Year Plan. Recently, Prime Minister Nehru proposed to double India's production in the next seven years, which is an encouraging news. The Chinese government and people have been following India's economic construction with great interest and sincerely hope for its success. We have always believed that a politically independent and economically strong India will make a greater contribution to peace in Asia and the world."

He said: "We are pleased to see that in the past year, the Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru have made many efforts and beneficial contributions to maintaining world peace and easing international tensions. The development of the international situation in the past year fully demonstrates that the peace zone consistently advocated by Prime Minister Nehru is expanding day by day, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India have had an increasingly significant impact internationally. The worldwide people's movement for peace and the struggles of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence continue to achieve great victories. Recently, the anti-dictatorial uprising of the Cuban people and the anti-colonialist struggle of the Congolese people have once again shown that the oppressed nations and people of the world will certainly rise up to regain their due rights, which cannot be suppressed by any force."

Vice Premier Chen Yi continued: "The Asian and African countries that have already achieved independence are facing the serious task of developing their national economies. In order to eliminate the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule, the people of these countries and their leaders have made various efforts and explored a path of independent economic development. We are pleased to see the achievements made by Asian and African countries in this regard. We would also like to point out that the Chinese people, after more than nine years of efforts, have found a path of developing industry, agriculture, culture, and science by relying mainly on their own efforts and relying on the initiative of the entire people. Although we may encounter some difficulties on this path, the Chinese people are fully confident of continuing to achieve greater achievements on the basis of what has already been achieved. What we are engaged in is peaceful economic construction, and the growth of our economic strength is only for the benefit of our own people and to help world peace and prosperity. The imperialists' slander that China's economic development will pose a threat to Asia and Africa is completely shameless nonsense. The Chinese people not only want to see their own economic development but also sincerely hope for the common economic development of Asian and African countries. We are willing to contribute our modest efforts to promote all economic cooperation that is beneficial to the people of Asia and Africa. We are also willing to exchange construction experiences with Asian and African countries in order to accelerate the economic development of our countries."

Speaking about friendly relations between China and India, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: "In the past one year, the profound friendship between China and India has further developed. We thank the Indian government for its support for our country in restoring our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations and in the issue of our country's liberation of Taiwan and coastal islands. We also thank the Indian government and people for their interest and sympathetic concern for our country's achievements in economic construction.

With the development of economic construction in China and India, our two countries are strengthening cooperation in the fields of economy and technology. His Excellency the Ambassador mentioned just now that the Indian government has decided to send a delegation to China to study the iron and steel industry, agriculture, and water conservancy, and the water conservancy delegation has already arrived in China. We extend a warm welcome to them. We will provide them with all possible conveniences. At the same time, we also want to learn from India's experience in construction. We believe that this exchange of experience and mutual learning will certainly help promote the common economic development of our two countries and further consolidate the friendship between our two peoples."

Some distinguished guests from the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, who are currently visiting our country, were also invited to attend the reception. They are: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Bolz, Deputy Minister Weiss, Professor Aldenne and Ambassador Wangde. The Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic recently visited India.

Also present at the reception were Vice Chairmen Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, as well as people from all walks of life in our country and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

Today's host, Ambassador Parthasarathi, spoke first at the beginning of the reception. He said: "The Republic of India was established in 1950, which is the first important milestone in the new independent India's progress towards building a democratic and unified society on the basis of freedom and social justice."

The Ambassador then talked about India's planned development of the national economy. He talked about the completed First Five-Year Plan and the ongoing Second Five-Year Plan. The Ambassador said: "The main goals of this plan are rapid industrialization, a substantial increase in national income, expansion of employment opportunities, and reduction of income and wealth imbalances. We will inevitably have to implement many five-year plans in order to achieve our goals. But we are full of confidence in the future because we feel that we must move forward."

The Ambassador continued: "While we are seeking to build a new and progressive society at home by peaceful and cooperative methods, we are also striving to assist in the resolution of international problems in a spirit of friendship and humility, and to help build a new world order on the basis of peace, cooperation and justice. This friendly approach is reflected in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India, which have been welcomed by people all over the world."

He said: "We are entering an era in which the development of science and the continuous improvement of people's awareness have opened the door to great material progress for the people of all countries. People in every region of the world are striving to improve their status, and progressive mankind is rejoicing in these achievements, because prosperity and peace are both essential."

He also said: "The efforts made by the People's Republic of China in leaping forward and building a modern economy provide us with a remarkable example." "Given that our two countries face many similar problems, we have been closely studying China's experience. Especially in the development of agriculture and steel, which are very important for the progress of our two countries, several delegations sent by India will conduct on-the-spot inspections in China in the coming weeks."

The Ambassador concluded by saying: "Friendship and cooperation between China and India are growing stronger, and these friendly cooperation include efforts in many aspects at the national and international levels. Last year, Chinese artists and scholars visited India, and we were very honored. Some of our leaders and experts have benefited greatly from visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government. The most notable was the visit of the Indian Navy's "Mysore" to China, which was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. This visit is a symbol of the friendly and good-neighborly relations between our two great countries."

At the reception, which lasted for nearly two hours, hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate Sino-Indian friendly cooperation and to congratulate the victory of world peace and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    陈毅副总理在印度大使国庆招待会上说
    中国期望亚非各国经济共同发展
    刘少奇委员长等到会祝贺印度国庆
    新华社26日讯　印度驻中国大使帕塔萨拉蒂今晚在北京举行盛大招待会，庆祝印度共和国成立九周年。刘少奇委员长和我国其他国家领导人出席了招待会。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话，他代表中国政府和人民向我们友好邻邦的政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。陈毅副总理在讲话中着重谈到了全世界人民争取和平的运动和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争不断取得伟大的胜利，中国人民衷心地期望亚非各国在经济上的共同发展，并且赞颂了中印两国深厚友谊的进一步发展。
    陈毅副总理说：“九年来，印度共和国在尼赫鲁总理的领导下，在建设自己的国家和发展民族经济方面，取得了很大的进展。三年前，印度完成了第一个五年计划。目前印度政府正在采取各种积极措施，为实现规模宏大的第二个五年计划而奋斗。最近尼赫鲁总理提出要在今后七年内使印度的生产增加一倍，这是一个令人鼓舞的消息。中国政府和人民一直以巨大的兴趣关注着印度的经济建设，并且衷心地期望它获得成功。我们始终认为，一个政治上独立的、经济上强大的印度将会对亚洲和世界的和平作出更大的贡献。”
    他说：“我们高兴地看到，一年来印度政府和尼赫鲁总理对于维护世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势作出了不少努力和有益的贡献。一年来国际局势的发展充分显示尼赫鲁总理一贯主张的和平地区正在日益扩大，中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则在国际上产生了越来越大的影响。全世界人民争取和平的运动和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争不断取得伟大的胜利。最近，古巴人民的反独裁起义和刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争，再一次说明世界上被压迫的民族和人民是一定要起来争回他们应得的权利，这是任何力量也压不下去的。
    陈毅副总理继续说：“已经取得了独立的亚非国家正面临着发展民族经济的严重任务。为了消除长期殖民统治所造成的贫穷和落后状态，这些国家的人民和他们的领导者作了各种各样的努力，在探索一条独立发展经济的道路。我们高兴地看到亚非国家在这一方面所取得的成就。我们也愿意指出，中国人民经过九年多的努力，已经找到了一条以自力更生为主，依靠全民的积极性，来发展工业、农业和文化科学事业的道路。尽管在这条道路上我们还会遇到一些困难，但是中国人民完全有信心在已经取得的成就的基础上继续取得更大的成就。我们所进行的是和平的经济建设，我们经济力量的增长只是为了造福本国的人民和有助于世界的和平和繁荣。帝国主义者诬蔑中国的经济发展将构成对亚非的威胁，这完全是无耻的谰言。中国人民不仅愿意看到自己的经济发展，而且衷心地期望亚非各国在经济上的共同发展。我们愿意贡献自己一分微薄的力量，来促进一切有利于亚非人民的经济合作。我们也愿意同亚非各国交流建设的经验，以求加速我们各国的经济发展速度。”
    在谈到中印两国的友好关系时，陈毅副总理指出：“一年来，中印两国的深厚友谊有了进一步的发展。我们感谢印度政府在恢复我国在联合国的合法地位和我国解放台湾和沿海岛屿问题上对我国的支持。我们也感谢印度政府和人民对我国经济建设成就所表示的兴趣和同情的关切。
    随着中印两国经济建设的发展，我们两国在经济技术方面的合作正在加强。大使阁下刚才提到印度政府决定派代表团来我国考察钢铁工业、农业和水利灌溉，其中水利考察团已经到达中国。我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎。我们将为他们提供一切可能的方便。同时我们也要向他们学习印度在建设中的经验。我们相信，这种经验交流和相互学习必将有助于促进我们两国经济的共同发展和进一步巩固我们两国人民的友谊。”
    正在我国访问的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的部分贵宾也应邀出席了招待会。他们是：博尔茨副总理兼外交部长、魏斯副部长、阿尔登内教授和汪戴尔大使。德意志民主共和国政府代表团不久前曾访问过印度。
    出席招待会的，还有副委员长沈钧儒、彭真、陈叔通，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及我国各方面的人士和各国驻华使节。
    今天招待会的主人——帕塔萨拉蒂大使在招待会开始时首先讲话。他说：“印度共和国建立于1950年，这是新独立的印度在自由与社会正义的基础上，朝着建立起一个民主和统一的社会目标前进中的第一个重要里程碑。”
    大使接着谈到了印度正在有计划地发展国民经济的问题，他谈到了已经完成的第一个五年计划和正在进行的第二个五年计划。大使说：“这个计划的主要目标是迅速工业化，使国民收入相当大的增长，扩大就业机会并减少收入与财富的不平衡现象。我们势必还要执行许多个五年计划，才能达到我们的目标。但是我们对于未来充满了信心，因为我们感到我们一定要走上前进的道路。”
    大使继续说：“在我们寻求以和平与合作的方法在国内建设一个新的进步社会的时候，我们也力图以友好和谦虚的精神协助解决国际问题，并在和平、合作与正义的基础上帮助建立一个新的世界秩序。这一友好方法在中国和印度共同倡议的、并受到全世界人民欢迎的和平共处五项原则内得到表现。”
    他说：“我们正进入一个时代，科学的发展和人民觉悟的不断提高为所有国家的人民的巨大物质进步打开了门路。世界上每一个地区的人民都在努力提高他们的地位，进步人类对于这些成就感到欢欣鼓舞，因为繁荣与和平一样都是不可少的。”
    他还说：“中华人民共和国在向前跃进以及在建立现代化经济方面所做的努力为我们提供了一个堪以注目的榜样。”“鉴于我们两个国家面对着许多类似的问题，所以我们一直在密切地研究着中国的经验。特别是在对于我们两国前进很重要的农业和钢铁这两方面的发展上，由印度派出的几个代表团将要在未来若干星期内在中国进行实地考察工作。”
    大使最后说：“中国和印度之间的友谊和合作日益增强，这些友好合作包括在国家和国际上的许多方面的努力。去年中国艺术家和学者们曾去印度访问，我们感到很荣幸。我们的一些领导人士和专家们应中国政府的邀请前来中国访问，也获益不少。最显著的就是印度海军“迈索尔”号在中国的访问，受到了中国人民热烈的欢迎。这一访问是我们两个伟大国家间友好和睦邻关系的一种象征。”
    在进行了将近两个小时的招待会上，几百位中外来宾频频举杯，祝贺中印友好合作，祝贺世界和平和和平共处五项原则的胜利。
