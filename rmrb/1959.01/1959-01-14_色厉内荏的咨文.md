The “State of the Union Address” presented by U.S. President Eisenhower to the U.S. Congress on January 9th was described by a United Press International reporter as “prepared more carefully than any document Eisenhower has ever delivered to Congress.” In this address, Eisenhower attempted to paint a rosy picture of the actually bleak “State of the Union,” flaunting America’s “robust strength” and trying to conceal the aggressive face of the American ruling class, portraying the United States as a nation "seeking a just peace." Eisenhower apparently hoped that this would dispel the anxiety of the domestic people about the actual state of the United States, maintain the trust of foreign "allies" in American leadership, and ease the opposition of the world's people to America's brinkmanship policy.

It is understandable that Eisenhower’s address devoted most of its space to economic issues, because economic problems are the most pressing issues currently facing the American ruling class. On the one hand, there is a serious economic crisis at home, and on the other hand, there is the peaceful economic competition proposed by the socialist camp, which, in Eisenhower's own words, will determine whether the U.S. government "can endure forever." So, in this case, what solutions can Eisenhower offer? The American president simply tried his best to depict the U.S. economic situation as a beautiful picture, saying that the U.S. economy is a "strong and growing economy" with "significant forward momentum," and that the economic recession is said to have gradually become a "historical relic," and that "the economy has been recovering in a healthy and vigorous manner," and so on. However, he cannot provide any facts to support his argument. Because, the facts are not very pleasant for this White House figure who has only two years left in his term. To name the main ones: the crisis of American production "surplus" is still serious; the level of industrial production in 1958 fell by nearly 7% compared with 1957; the annual operating rate of the steel industry averaged just over 60%; automobile production was reduced by 30% compared with 1957; the vicious expenditure of expanding arms and preparing for war has contributed to a serious financial crisis, according to the American officials, the budget deficit for 1958-1959 (ending at the end of this June) will be as high as more than 12.2 billion U.S. dollars, the national debt has reached a peak of 281 billion U.S. dollars, and the outflow of American gold in 1958 was more than 2.4 billion U.S. dollars, and the annual currency issuance increased by 13 billion U.S. dollars; inflation has caused rising prices, and in the past year, the cost of living in the United States rose by 2.5%; unemployment is very serious, at the end of 1958, there were more than 4 million people fully unemployed and 12 million people partially unemployed. Faced with these iron facts, Eisenhower can only abandon the facts and talk vaguely about "confidence in the competitive enterprise system."

However, it seems that even Eisenhower himself does not completely believe in the picture he portrays. Because in his address he talks a lot about "not allowing the United States to stagnate," "avoiding any factors that promote inflation," "balancing receipts and expenditures," "ensuring the stability of the U.S. dollar," and "creating an environment of stable prices." Most intriguing is that he expressed his readiness to adopt the method implemented by former U.S. President Hoover in 1931, establishing a committee to study the social and economic changes in the United States; as everyone knows, 1931 was the year when the economic crisis that began in 1929 in the United States developed very seriously. Obviously, these remarks by Eisenhower cannot be regarded as groundless or "unnecessary worries." This is precisely a reflection of "the various anxieties that must be entrenched in President Eisenhower's mind" ("The Times"), exposing his inner fears about the U.S. economic outlook.

Eisenhower put forward the largest military budget in peacetime in his address, exceeding 47 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about 10 billion U.S. dollars over the previous year, accounting for nearly 60% of the entire federal budget. But he was afraid that the huge military spending would cause a financial crisis and inflation, so he tried to cut non-military expenditures as much as possible, attempting to take measures such as restricting wages and reducing agricultural subsidies to balance the budget. In this way, the U.S. government's budget may be balanced on paper; however, can this deformed balance obtained by increasing military expenditure and reducing non-military expenditure work? Will it not deepen the crisis of production "surplus"? Will it not cause fierce opposition from the American people? Eisenhower himself knew that this was a difficult problem, so he shifted the responsibility to the Democratic-controlled Congress, asking Congress to "cooperate" with him to "balance receipts and expenditures." It seems that the issue of "balanced receipts and expenditures" is likely to become a "political football" kicked back and forth between the Republican and Democratic parties, and the U.S. economic outlook will be increasingly jeopardized in this back-and-forth process.

When Eisenhower talked about the "challenge" of socialist countries "with strong and growing economic and military power" in his address, and when he shouted almost hysterically that "the classics of Marxism are not new, they are not the gospel of the future," it is not difficult for people to see how dim Eisenhower's mood is. This is the lament of the defenders of the old system! The billion hard-working people of the new world, precisely under the brilliance of Marxism, have built a happy society that does not know what economic crisis is, flourishing and thriving, which cannot but have an increasing attraction to the millions of working people in the old world who are groaning under the economic crisis! This is indeed a "challenge", but it is a challenge of peaceful competition! Eisenhower is powerless to face this challenge and can only pray to the people of the capitalist world not to believe that Marxism is the gospel of the future.

Obviously because the peace policy of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has penetrated deeply into people's hearts, because the American war-edge policy has put the United States in an unprecedentedly isolated position, and because the American people generally oppose war, Eisenhower talked more about his "peace" in his address than in the past. If the U.S. government really changes its aggressive policy and implements the policy of "committing to a lasting and just peace" that Eisenhower boasts, this is of course not a bad thing; however, anyone with a little sense can easily see that the U.S. authorities' attitude towards peace reflected in this address is far from serious.

First of all, Eisenhower, as in the past, emphasized the need to rely on "strong deterrent power" to "achieve peace." However, everyone knows that it is precisely the U.S.'s "policy of strength" that has created international tensions. Eisenhower spent a lot of ink in his address to flaunt the U.S. armed forces and military technology, but this, in addition to proving the bellicosity of the U.S. ruling class, can only give people a ridiculous feeling. Because, in the world where red planets roam space, the iron fact has proved that the Soviet Union has the most superb and advanced rocket launching technology in the world, and the balance of world power has undergone tremendous changes. Today, the American president is still flaunting America's "deterrent power," at least—to put it politely—is unwise. What's more, this kind of bluffing is, at best, like whistling through a graveyard in the dark, to embolden himself and his "allies."

Secondly, in order to prove that the United States must seek peace through a "policy of strength," Eisenhower insisted that the Communists "disregard" international agreements and declared that "we cannot have confidence in any treaty in which Communists participate." This slander of socialist countries precisely exposes that the United States has no intention of reaching any agreement with socialist countries on the issue of easing international tensions and benefiting world peace. As for who is accustomed to disregarding international agreements, then, one only needs to look back at the actions of the United States and its partners since the end of World War II to destroy sacred international agreements such as the Potsdam Agreement and the Cairo Declaration, and it will be clear at a glance. These facts can never be covered up by Eisenhower's tricks of reversing black and white.

Eisenhower described the United States' behavior in Lebanon, Taiwan, and Berlin as proof that the United States "does not condone aggression" and is committed to peace. This is precisely a disservice! In the past year, what has put the United States in an unprecedentedly isolated position is precisely because the United States invaded Lebanon, especially invaded China's territory of Taiwan? The provocative actions of the U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan Strait region have aroused huge storms of protest all over the world and have become one of the factors for the Republican Party's disastrous defeat in the U.S. congressional elections last year. It seems that Eisenhower has not learned anything from this. In his address, he still announced that he would "unswervingly" implement this aggressive policy in the name of "not condoning aggression." This shows that the United States wants to continue to occupy our country's Taiwan, continue to carry out aggression in the Middle East, and continue to occupy West Berlin. This also shows how hypocritical Eisenhower's so-called "commitment to peace" is!

Eisenhower's address fully demonstrates that the U.S. government intends to continue to adhere to the bankrupt policy of strength, to be an enemy of peace, and to be an enemy of the people of the world. It is no wonder that this has aroused widespread dissatisfaction all over the world, even in the United States' "allies." The London "Times" pointed out bluntly that Eisenhower's address "has almost nothing new," and believes that "for even the most optimistic people, the prospect cannot be encouraging." Japan's "Sankei Shimbun" also said that Eisenhower's address "lacks freshness and imagination," and "it nakedly exposes the predicament of the (U.S.) Republican government." No future and hope, this is the conclusion people have reached about the domestic and foreign policies of the U.S. ruling class as stated in Eisenhower's address.

### 色厉内荏的咨文

    色厉内荏的咨文
    1月9日，美国总统艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出了一年一度的“国情咨文”。在这篇被合众国际社记者称为“比艾森豪威尔向国会发表过的任何文件经过更仔细的准备”的咨文中，艾森豪威尔企图替美国的实际上是黯淡无光的“国情”涂上一层玫瑰色，炫耀美国的“雄厚的力量”，并且力图掩饰美国统治集团的侵略面目，把美国装扮成为一个“谋求公正的和平”的国家。艾森豪威尔显然希望这样就可以消除国内人民对美国实际国情的不安，维系国外“盟国”对美国领导地位的信任，缓和世界人民对美国战争边缘政策的反对。
    艾森豪威尔的咨文以大部分的篇幅来谈经济问题，这是不难理解的，因为，经济问题是美国统治集团当前所面临的最紧迫的问题。一方面是国内的严重的经济危机，另一方面是社会主义阵营所提出的和平经济竞赛，而这一竞赛，用艾森豪威尔自己的话来说，将要决定美国政府是否“能够永远存在下去”。那么，在这种情况下，艾森豪威尔能够拿出什么办法来呢？这位美国总统只是竭力把美国的经济状况描绘成一幅美妙的图画，说什么美国经济是具有“显著的前进冲力”的“强大而且日益发展的经济”，经济衰退的情况据说是已逐渐成为“历史的陈迹”，“经济一直在健全而有力地复苏中”，等等。但是，他却提不出任何事实来支持他的这种论断。因为，事实对于这位还有两年才满任的白宫要人来说是很不美妙的。举其主要的说来：美国的生产“过剩”危机依然严重，1958年的工业生产水平比1957年下降了将近7％，钢铁工业的全年开工率平均只达到60％稍多一点，汽车产量比1957年缩减了30％；扩军备战的恶性开支已经促成了严重的财政金融危机，据美国官方宣布，1958—1959年度（到今年6月底止）的预算赤字将高达一百二十二亿美元以上，国债已达二千八百一十亿美元的高峰，1958年美国外流黄金二十四亿余美元，全年通货的发行量增加了一百三十亿美元；通货膨胀造成物价的上涨，去年一年中，美国生活费用上涨了2.5％；失业情况十分严重，1958年年底还有四百万余人全失业，一千二百万人半失业。在这些铁的事实的面前，艾森豪威尔只能丢开事实空谈“对竞争企业制度的信心”了。
    但是，看来连艾森豪威尔自己对他所描绘的图画也不完全相信。因为他在咨文中大谈“不允许美国产生停滞不前的现象”，“必须避免任何促进通货膨胀的因素”，“使收支平衡”，“保证美元稳定”，“创造一种物价稳定的环境”。最耐人寻味的是，他表示准备采取前美国总统胡佛在1931年所实行的办法，成立一个委员会来研究美国社会和经济的变化；大家知道，1931年正是美国的那次开始于1929年的经济大危机发展得十分严重的一年。显然不能认为艾森豪威尔这些谈论是无的放矢或“杞人之忧”。这正是反映了“必然盘踞在艾森豪威尔总统心中的种种不安”（“泰晤士报”），暴露了他对美国经济前景的内心恐惧。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中提出了一个和平时期中最大的军事预算，超过四百七十亿美元，比上年度大约增加了十亿美元，占整个联邦预算的将近60％。但是他又害怕巨额的军费会引起财政危机和通货膨胀，于是就尽量削减非军事开支，企图采取限制工资、减少农业津贴等办法来平衡预算。这样，美国政府的预算也许在账面上可以平衡；然而，这种增加军事开支、削减非军事开支所得到的畸形平衡，能行得通吗？能不加深生产“过剩”的危机吗？能不引起美国人民的激烈反对吗？艾森豪威尔自己也知道这是个难题，所以就把责任推给民主党控制的国会，要国会同他“合作”，“使收支平衡”。看来，这个“收支平衡”的问题很可能变成一个“政治足球”，在共和党和民主党之间踢来踢去，而美国的经济前景也就在这一来一往之间日益陷于不妙的境地。
    当艾森豪威尔在咨文中谈到“拥有强大而不断增长的经济和军事力量的”社会主义国家的“挑战”时，当他近乎歇斯底里地叫喊“马克思主义的经典并不是新的，它不是未来的福音”时，人们不难看到艾森豪威尔的心情是多么暗淡。这是旧制度卫护者的哀鸣！新世界的十亿勤劳人民，正是在马克思主义的光辉照耀下，用自己的双手建立了不知经济危机为何物的幸福社会，欣欣向荣，蒸蒸日上，这对旧世界的千百万在经济危机下呻吟的劳动人民，不能不具有越来越大的吸引力！这确实是“挑战”，然而是和平竞赛的挑战！艾森豪威尔无力面对这一挑战，只能向隅祈求资本主义世界的人民不要相信马克思主义是未来的福音了。
    显然是由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的和平政策已经深入人心，由于美国的战争边缘政策已经使美国处于空前孤立的地位，由于美国人民普遍反对战争，艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中比以往更多地大谈特谈其“和平”。如果美国政府真的改变它的侵略政策，执行艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的“致力于缔结持久、公正的和平”的政策，这当然不是坏事；但是，稍有头脑的人都不难看到，这个咨文所反映的美国当局对和平的态度远不是认真的。
    首先，艾森豪威尔仍然同过去一样地强调要依靠“强大的威慑力量”来“实现和平”。但是，谁都知道，正是美国的这种“实力政策”，造成了国际紧张局势。艾森豪威尔在他的咨文中是费了不少笔墨来炫耀美国的武装力量和军事技术，但是，这除了证明美国统治集团好战成性之外，只能给人以一种可笑的感觉。因为，在红色行星遨游太空，铁的事实已经证明苏联拥有世界上最高超、最先进的发射火箭的技术，世界力量的对比已经发生巨大变化的今天，这位美国总统还在炫耀美国的“威慑力量”，至少——说得客气一点——也是不聪明的。何况这种虚张声势的做法，充其量不过是等于黑夜吹着口哨过坟场，替自己和“盟国”壮壮胆而已。
    其次，艾森豪威尔为了证明美国必须通过“实力政策”来谋求和平，硬说共产党“无视”国际协定，宣称“只要是共产党人参加的条约，我们都不能对它抱信心”。这种对社会主义国家的诽谤，恰恰暴露了美国无意在缓和国际紧张局势和有利于世界和平的问题上同社会主义国家达成任何协议。至于究竟谁惯于无视国际协定，那么，人们只要回顾一下第二次世界大战结束以来美国及其伙伴们破坏像波茨坦协定和开罗宣言这样一些神圣的国际协定的行为，就一清二楚了。这种事实绝不是艾森豪威尔颠倒黑白的手法所能掩盖得了的。
    艾森豪威尔把美国在黎巴嫩、台湾、柏林的行为说成是美国“不纵容侵略”、致力于和平的证明。这恰恰是帮了一个倒忙！在过去一年中，使美国处于空前孤立地位的，不正是因为美国侵略黎巴嫩，特别是侵略中国的领土台湾吗？美国武装部队在台湾海峡地区的挑衅行动，在全世界引起了巨大的抗议风暴，并且成为共和党在去年美国国会选举中遭受惨败的因素之一。看来艾森豪威尔并没有从这里得到什么教益，他在咨文中还是宣布要“坚定不移”地执行这种以“不纵容侵略”为名的侵略政策。这表明美国要继续霸占我国的台湾，继续在中东地区实行侵略，继续霸占西柏林。这也就表明艾森豪威尔所说的“致力于和平”云云，是多么虚伪！
    艾森豪威尔的咨文充分表明了美国政府打算继续坚持早已破产了的实力政策，与和平为敌，与世界人民为敌。这就无怪乎在全世界引起了广泛的不满，甚至在美国的“盟国”中也不例外。伦敦“泰晤士报”就毫不客气地指出艾森豪威尔的咨文“差不多没有什么新的东西”，并且认为“对那怕是最乐观的人来说，前景也不可能是感到鼓舞的”。日本“产经新闻”也说艾森豪威尔的咨文“缺乏新鲜的东西和想像力”，“它赤裸裸地暴露了（美国）共和党政府所处的困境”。没有前途和希望，这就是人们对艾森豪威尔的咨文所陈述的美国统治集团的内外政策的结论。
