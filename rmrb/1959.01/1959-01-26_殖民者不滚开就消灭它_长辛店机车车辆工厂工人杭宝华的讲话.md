    Comrades:
    I represent the workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory to say a few words, and I believe this is what all the workers in the city want to say.
    We warmly celebrate the significant victory already achieved by the Cuban national independence revolution. We cheer the vigorous development of the Congolese people's anti-imperialist struggle. We firmly support the Cuban national democratic revolution! We oppose American interference in Cuba's internal affairs! We firmly support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence! We oppose the Belgian colonial authorities' massacre of the Congolese people! Cuban and Congolese brothers and sisters, we are your backing. Continue the struggle and victory will be yours.
    I am an old worker who has worked for forty-three years at the Beijing Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. I personally witnessed the suppression and massacre of our railway workers by the warlord government on February 7, 1923, thirty-six years ago. I endured the oppression of the warlords, the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government. In those days, our workers called the Liuli River near the factory the "River of Tears," and Changxindian the "Heartbreak Shop." Those days were as miserable as the days under Batista's rule and under Belgian colonial rule. We, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, achieved independence and democracy through a long period of armed struggle. Now, the Cuban people have also achieved a major victory through armed struggle, needless to say, how happy we are! As long as the Congolese people continue to struggle resolutely, they will eventually achieve victory. American imperialism is now trying to find excuses to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, and the Belgian colonial authorities are carrying out cruel suppression of the Congolese people's struggle for independence. We want to warn these colonialists: the torrent of national liberation movements cannot be stopped! American imperialism has been ferociously interfering in China's internal affairs, but the result has proved it to be only a paper tiger, and it has already tucked its tail and rolled out of mainland China. It will certainly have to roll out of Taiwan, roll out of Asia, roll out of Africa, and roll out of Latin America! All imperialists can only roll back to their old homes. If they don't roll away, they will only be beaten to death.
    Long live the victory of the national liberation movement!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

    殖民者不滚开就消灭它
    长辛店机车车辆工厂工人杭宝华的讲话同志们：
    我代表长辛店机车车辆工厂的工人说几句话，我相信，这也是全市工人想说的话。
    我们热烈庆祝古巴民族独立革命运动已经取得的重大胜利。我们欢呼刚果人民反帝斗争的蓬勃发展。我们坚决支持古巴民族民主革命运动！反对美国干涉古巴内政！我们坚决支持刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争！反对比利时殖民当局屠杀刚果人民！古巴和刚果的兄弟姊妹们，我们是你们的后盾。继续斗争下去就是胜利。
    我是在北京长辛店机车车辆工厂作了四十三年工的老工人。我亲眼看见过三十六年以前，1923年2月7日军阀政府对我们铁路工人的镇压屠杀，我经受过军阀的压迫、日本帝国主义的压迫和国民党反动政府的压迫。在那些日子里，我们工人把工厂附近的琉璃河叫“流泪河”，把长辛店叫“伤心店”，那种日子，和巴蒂斯塔统治下的日子，和比利时殖民统治下的日子，是一样悲惨的。我们中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，经过长期的武装斗争，取得了独立和民主。现在，古巴人民也经过武装斗争，取得了重大胜利，不用提，我们是多么高兴哪！刚果人民只要坚决斗争下去，终有一天会取得胜利的。美帝国主义现在想找借口干涉古巴内政，比利时殖民当局正在对刚果人民的独立斗争进行残酷的镇压，我们要警告这些殖民主义者：民族解放运动的巨流是挡不住的！美帝国主义一直在穷凶极恶地干涉中国的内政，但是结果证明是只纸老虎，已经夹着尾巴从中国大陆滚出去了。它一定还要从台湾滚出去，从亚洲滚出去，从非洲滚出去，从拉丁美洲滚出去！所有的帝国主义者都只有滚回它们的老家去。不滚开就只有被打死。
    民族解放运动胜利万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
