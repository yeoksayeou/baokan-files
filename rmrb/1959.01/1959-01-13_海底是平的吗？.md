    Is the Seabed Flat?
    Just as the continents have plains, mountains, basins, and plateaus, the deep ocean also has similar terrain. Near the coast, the shallow sea areas within 200 meters are called continental shelves, which are underwater plateaus. The terrain on this plateau is flat, making it a good habitat for fish, and it accounts for about 8% of the ocean area. At the edge of the continental shelf, where it meets the deep sea, is the continental slope, which has a steep incline and accounts for about 12% of the ocean area. Further down is a relatively flat area, which is the ocean basin, with an average depth of four to five thousand meters, accounting for about 80% of the ocean area. In this region, one may encounter sudden, sunken, gully-like areas called ocean trenches. The deepest trench in the Pacific Ocean, the Mariana Trench, is 10,899 meters deep, more than 2,000 meters deeper than Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world.

    海底是平的吗？
    大陆上有平原、山地、盆地、高原之分。说也奇怪，大洋深处的地形也有类似情况。靠近海岸，那些在二百公尺以内的浅海地带称之为大陆浅滩，是内海中的高原。在这个高原上，地势是平坦的，是鱼类栖息的好地方，约占海洋面积的8％左右。在大陆浅滩的边缘，即与深海交界的地方，叫大陆斜坡，倾斜度甚大，约占海洋面积的12％左右。再下去又是一片比较平坦的地带，这就是大洋盆地，平均深度四、五千公尺，占海洋面积80％左右。在这个区域有时会遇见突然下陷之山沟状地带，称为海渊，太平洋中最深的马里亚纳海渊深达一万零八百九十九公尺，比世界上最高的珠穆朗玛峰还多二千多公尺。
