Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 22nd. A joint communiqué of the talks between the government delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the German Democratic Republic was issued on the 21st.

The joint communiqué stated that the government delegations of the two countries exchanged views on some issues concerning the international situation, on consolidating the unity of the socialist camp, and on the reunification of Vietnam and the reunification of Germany on a basis of peace and democracy. The two sides also exchanged views on strengthening the fraternal cooperation between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the German Democratic Republic. The government delegations of the two countries were very pleased to see that they had reached a complete consensus on the above issues.

The joint communiqué stated that both sides were satisfied that the forces of world peace were growing stronger and that the balance of world power was increasingly developing in a direction favorable to the forces of peace and socialism. As facts have proven, the forces of peace and socialism are fully capable of effectively dealing with the imperialist war policy.

The joint communiqué stated that on the basis of the agreement reached at the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957, and in the struggle against all forms of modern revisionism, both sides will work to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to continuously strengthen the cooperation between socialist countries.

The communiqué congratulated the growing anti-colonialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The communiqué declared that the two countries will always be sincere friends of all nations struggling for and consolidating independence and will make every effort to support their struggles. The communiqué condemned the imperialists, headed by U.S. imperialism, and their followers for violating the will of the nations to demand peace and security and for pursuing a brink-of-war policy.

The joint communiqué stated that both sides believe that the liberation of Taiwan is entirely an internal affair of the People's Republic of China, and all U.S. military forces should immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area. Both sides believe that the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored. The governments of both countries also expressed their support for the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The joint communiqué stated that in order to ensure peace, it is necessary to eradicate the hotbeds of war created by imperialist policies, and all international disputes must be resolved through peaceful consultation on the basis of respect for the right of national self-determination and the sovereignty of all countries.

The joint communiqué stated that the government delegations of the two countries extensively exchanged views on the situation in Vietnam and Germany. Regarding the situation in Vietnam, both sides emphasized that Vietnam must be reunified by peaceful means in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords. Both sides believe that U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities have flagrantly violated this agreement.

The joint communiqué stated that both sides resolutely condemn U.S. imperialism's interference in South Vietnam, the purpose of which is to undermine peace and perpetuate the division of Vietnam, and to savagely suppress and persecute patriots and former resistance personnel in South Vietnam; both sides condemn the provocative acts of U.S. imperialism to create tension in Indochina, such as the recent provocative actions in border areas between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Laos.

The Government of the German Democractic Republic fully supports the policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for peaceful reunification of the country and related proposals.

The joint communiqué also stated that regarding the situation in Germany, both sides believe that the United States, Britain, and France have violated the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, creating an abnormal situation in Germany that threatens peace. The forces of monopoly capitalists and militarists in West Germany have been restored, and German imperialists have become the main allies of U.S. imperialism in Europe. Now, West Germany has become the most dangerous hotbed of war in Europe. Due to this change in the situation, the issue of signing a peace treaty with Germany has become one of the most urgent international issues. The Soviet Union's proposal to sign a peace treaty with Germany points out the most practical shortcut to safeguarding peace in Europe and creates conditions for the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Germany. Signing the above-mentioned treaty will be conducive to the national interests of the German people and other European peoples, greatly ease tensions in Europe, and make it easier to resolve other international disputes. It is also for the above-mentioned purposes that it is advocated to turn West Berlin into a free, demilitarized city.

The joint communiqué stated that the unification of Germany is a matter for the German people and can only be resolved through consultations between the two Germanys. From this point of view, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again announced its full support for the proposal of the German Democratic Republic on the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys.

The communiqué stated that the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam emphasized that the German Democratic Republic is an important factor in maintaining peace in Europe, and the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced its firm support for the struggle of the German Democratic Republic for a peaceful settlement of the German question.

Both sides were satisfied that since the restoration of peace in Indochina, the relations between the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the German Democratic Republic, which are based on proletarian internationalism, are becoming closer and developing. Both sides expressed their intention to continue to vigorously expand these relations.

The communiqué stated that both sides will develop cooperative relations in the economic, technical, and scientific fields.

    越德两国政府代表团发表会谈公报
    全力支持亚非和拉丁美洲反殖民主义斗争
    坚决谴责美国阻挠两国和平统一事业
    新华社河内22日电　越南民主共和国政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团在21日发表了两国政府会谈的联合公报。
    联合公报说，两国政府代表团就有关国际形势的一些问题、关于巩固社会主义阵营的团结一致和在和平民主的基础上统一越南和统一德国等问题交换了意见。双方还就加强越南民主共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的兄弟般的合作问题交换了意见。两国政府代表团很满意地看到，双方对上述问题取得了完全一致的看法。
    联合公报说，双方都满意地认为：世界和平力量日益强大，世界力量的对比日益朝着有利于和平和社会主义的力量的方向发展。正如事实所证明，和平和社会主义的力量完全能够有效地对付帝国主义的战争政策。
    联合公报说，在1957年11月各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的协议的基础上，在反对形形色色的现代修正主义的斗争中，双方将致力于加强以苏联为首的社会主义的团结，不断地加强社会主义国家的合作。
    公报表示祝贺正在日益壮大的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反殖民主义斗争。公报宣布，两国永远是为争取和巩固独立而斗争的各民族的真诚朋友，并竭力支持他们的斗争。公报谴责以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和它们的追随者违背各民族要求和平和安全的意志，奉行着战争边缘政策。
    联合公报说，双方认为，解放台湾完全是中华人民共和国内政，美国的一切军事力量应该立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区。双方认为，必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。两国政府还表示支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于和平统一朝鲜的建议。
    联合公报说，为了使和平获得保障，必须铲除帝国主义政策所制造的战争温床，必须在尊重各民族自决权和各国主权的基础上，以和平协商方式解决各种国际争端。
    联合公报说，两国政府代表团就越南和德国的局势广泛交换了意见。关于越南局势，双方强调指出，越南必须按照1954年日内瓦协议，通过和平方法获得统一。双方认为，美帝国主义和越南南方当局已经粗暴地违反了这一协议。
    联合公报说，双方坚决谴责美帝国主义干涉越南南方，这种干涉行为的目的是为了破坏和平和延续越南的分裂状态，非常野蛮地镇压和迫害越南南方的爱国者和前抗战人员；双方谴责美帝国主义为了制造印度支那的紧张局势而进行的挑衅行为，例如最近在越南民主共和国和老挝王国边境地区的挑衅行动。
    德意志民主共和国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府的和平统一国家的政策和有关的建议。
    联合公报还说，关于德国局势，双方认为，美、英、法违反波茨坦协定的原则，在德国造成了不正常的威胁和平的局势。西德的垄断资本家和军国主义者的势力已被恢复，德国的帝国主义者已经成为美帝国主义在欧洲的主要同盟者。现在，西德已成为欧洲最危险的战争温床。由于局势的这种变化，使得同德国签订和约的问题已经成为最迫切的国际问题之一。苏联提出的同德国签订和约的建议，指出了维护欧洲和平的最切实的捷径，并且为成立一个和平民主的德国创造条件。签订上述和约，将有利于德国人民和其他欧洲人民的民族利益，使欧洲的紧张局势大大缓和，并且使其它国际争端易于解决。也正是为了上述目的，所以主张把西柏林变为自由的、非军事化的城市。
    联合公报说，德国的统一是德国人民的事情，它只能通过两个德国协商的方法来解决。从这一观点出发，越南民主共和国政府再一次宣布完全支持德意志民主共和国提出的关于两个德国建立邦联的建议。
    公报说，越南民主共和国政府代表团强调指出，德意志民主共和国是维护欧洲和平的重要因素，越南民主共和国政府代表团宣布，坚决支持德意志民主共和国为和平解决德国问题而进行的斗争。
    双方都满意地认为，印度支那和平恢复以来越南民主共和国同德意志民主共和国之间建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的关系，正在更加紧密和发展。双方表示将继续大力扩大这些关系。
    公报说，双方将在经济、技术和科学等方面发展合作关系。
