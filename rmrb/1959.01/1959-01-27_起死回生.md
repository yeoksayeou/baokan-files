    Resurrected from the Dead
    One cold winter night. The earth was silent, and people were sleeping soundly. In a small house in the Caiyu Commune Health Center on the outskirts of Beijing, the lights were still bright.
    The doctors and nurses of the Beijing Tongren Hospital medical team were rescuing a rural woman suffering from excessive bleeding due to an ectopic pregnancy. Pediatrician Liu Yungong was drawing blood from Dr. Tian Pingzhong to transfuse to the patient. Some nurses were holding the patient's legs to keep them still, and some doctors were measuring blood pressure. Nurse Cao Shuzhi, who was standing by the patient, gently cleaned the patient's body of feces with hot water and disinfected her. Gynecologist Guo Weiyan and others, who had rushed from more than sixty miles away overnight, were busy preparing for the operation.
    The operation began, and the medical staff removed the fetus from the ruptured fallopian tube. Then they stitched up the wound and continued the blood transfusion. The mercury column on the blood pressure monitor rose from sixty, seventy, to eighty, ninety. Only then did the doctors breathe a sigh of relief.
    On the seventh day after the operation, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The patient and her family expressed their infinite gratitude to the doctors and nurses of the medical team. From then on, before people even got out of bed, the patient's husband quietly fetched water for the medical team. When the doctors asked him not to do this, he said excitedly, "It was the doctors sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who saved the dying person. Let me express my gratitude!"

    起死回生
    一个寒风袭人的冬夜。大地静寂无声，人们正睡的香甜，京郊采育公社卫生院的一间小平房里，仍是灯光通明。
    这是北京同仁医院医疗队的大夫和护士们，正在抢救一个患子宫外孕出血过多的农村妇女。儿科大夫刘蕴恭在吸出田平忠大夫的血液为病人输血，有的护士把住病人的腿使它固定，有的医生作血压测量。守在病人身旁的护士曹淑芝，轻轻地用热水给病人擦干净身上的粪便，进行了消毒。从六十多里外连夜赶来的产妇科大夫郭维言等，在忙着动手术的准备工作。
    手术开始了，医护人员从已破的输卵管中取出了胎儿。接着缝好伤口，继续输血。血压器上的水银柱从六十、七十又升到八十、九十。这时，大夫们才松了一口气。
    动手术后的第七天，病人出院了。病人和病人的亲属，对医疗队的大夫、护士表示了无限的感激。从此，每天人们还都没有起床，病人的丈夫就悄悄地为医疗队挑水，当大夫们请他不要这样作的时候，他激动地说：“共产党、毛主席派来的医生才把快死的人救活了，你们就让我表白表白感谢的心意吧！”
