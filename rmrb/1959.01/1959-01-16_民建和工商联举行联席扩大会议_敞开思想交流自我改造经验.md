Xinhua News Agency, January 15th. The joint (expanded meeting) of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the China Democratic National Constructive Association and the Third Session of the Second Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade and Commerce opened in Beijing this morning. How to strengthen self-reform and actively serve socialism for national industrialists and businessmen is the central topic of this meeting.

The meeting today was presided over by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in his opening speech: "The main task of this meeting is to open up our minds, improve our understanding, and on the basis of a clear understanding, exchange experiences in self-reform, so as to further promote our members to loyally accept the leadership of the Party, based on labor and practice, taking the enterprise or work post as the base, strengthen self-reform and actively serve socialism."

Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, delivered a work report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Li Zhuchen said in his report: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China over the past few years, through continuous self-reform, especially after experiencing the anti-Rightist struggle and the general rectification movement, the changes in the political and ideological outlook of industrialists and businessmen are significant. This is a considerable progress in the path of self-reform for industrialists and businessmen. However, it cannot be said that this progress has enabled the majority of industrialists and businessmen to reach the point of changing their capitalist stance to a socialist stance, and has reached the point of getting rid of dualism." "It is not enough for our industrialists and businessmen to be self-reliant, it is more important and decisive to transform our political and ideological outlook to be roughly in line with the six political criteria pointed out by Chairman Mao."

Li Zhuchen pointed out that the two associations should do their best to help and educate their members to break the bourgeois stance and ideology and establish the working-class stance and ideology on the basis of labor and practice, and actively serve the socialist construction cause. Regarding working methods, it should be particularly emphasized that the principle of "encouragement and criticism, combining encouragement and criticism" should be adopted.

Prior to the opening of today's conference, more than 500 committee members and attendees held a 21-day preparatory meeting. The meeting implemented the spirit of gentle breeze and drizzle. Everyone opened their minds and repeatedly discussed the current political and ideological situation of the industrial and commercial circles and some major issues related to self-reform.

    民建和工商联举行联席扩大会议
    敞开思想交流自我改造经验
    新华社15日讯　中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第四次全体会议、中华全国工商业联合会第二届执行委员会第三次会议联席（扩大）会议，今天上午在北京开幕。全国工商业者如何加强自我改造和积极为社会主义服务，是这次会议的中心议题。
    今天的会议由全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通主持。中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培在致开幕词中说：“这次会议的主要任务，就是要敞开思想，提高认识，在明确认识的基础上，交流自我改造的经验，进一步推动我们两会成员忠诚接受党的领导，在劳动和实践的基础上，以企业或者工作岗位为基地，加强自我改造，积极为社会主义服务。”
    中国民主建国会副主任委员李烛尘代表民建中央常委会和全国工商联常委会作了工作报告。李烛尘在报告中说：“工商业者几年来在中国共产党的领导下经过不断的自我改造，特别是经历了反右派斗争和一般整风运动，政治思想面貌的变化是显著的，这是工商业者自我改造道路上一个不小的进展。但是，决不能说，这个进展已经使多数工商业者达到了改变资本主义立场为社会主义立场的程度，达到了摆脱两面性的程度。”“我们工商业者不仅要作到自食其力，更为重要而有决定意义的，是把自己的政治思想面貌改造得大体上符合毛主席所指出的六项政治标准。”
    李烛尘指出，两会今后要尽心竭力地、细致深入地帮助和教育两会的成员在劳动和实践的基础上破资产阶级的立场和思想，立工人阶级的立场和思想，积极地为社会主义建设事业服务。对于工作方法，特别强调应该采取“有鼓励、有批评，把鼓励和批评结合起来的原则。”
    在今天大会开幕以前，五百多名出席会议的委员和列席会议的人员，曾经举行了二十一天的预备会议。会议贯彻了和风细雨的精神，大家敞开思想，反复讨论了当前工商界存在的政治思想情况和有关自我改造的一些重大问题。
