　　Cleverly Accumulating Manure
　　Jiang Lan, Fenghuang, Hunan

The commune affairs meeting had just ended, and people were gradually dispersing. On the rugged mountain road, Captain Yang Guangyuan walked slowly in the hazy moonlight. He thought: the team has more than two hundred and eighty mu of land, each mu requires four thousand dan of fertilizer, which means a total of more than one hundred and ten thousand dan of fertilizer is needed, but only thirty-odd people can participate in accumulating fertilizer. Not to mention accumulating it, just transporting this fertilizer from the rugged mountain roads to the fields would be difficult enough. The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became. Finally, he found a clue to solve the problem, he remembered "Sand Knife Carpenter."

In Shanmuping, "Sand Knife Carpenter" Han Yan has quite a bit of prestige. He is honest and sincere and usually doesn't like to talk much. His greatest characteristic is his flexible mind and willingness to study. He originally hadn't learned carpentry, but he usually liked to tinker with axes and files. Sometimes, if the family lacked a piece of wooden furniture or needed to repair the house, he would always roll up his sleeves and do it himself. Although the things he made were not very exquisite, they were still useful. Neighbors saw it and occasionally asked him to help repair tables and chairs or mend doors and windows. After the autumn harvest, when farm work was a bit easier, he was often invited by carpenter Zhang of this village to be an assistant. Therefore, the name "Sand Knife Carpenter" was how people started to call him.

Last spring plowing and sowing, when they were setting up standard seedling plots, Han Yan saw that the commune members were digging ditches by hand, which was both laborious and slow. After thinking about it, he quietly spent less than half a day making a standard seedling plot ditching tool, which the commune members all praised. Thinking of this, Captain Yang couldn't help but quicken his pace and went straight to Han Yan's house.

Yang Guangyuan went inside and sat down on a chair, explaining his purpose. Old Han listened, lowered his head, and just smoked, frowned and said: "The task of accumulating fertilizer is very arduous, we should think about how to do it cleverly." He reloaded a bag of tobacco, and while smoking, he stared at the ground in a daze, holding a wooden stick in his hand, drawing on the ground from time to time, his face sometimes showing a very puzzled expression. "I've got it, we can improve it according to the principle of cableway transportation." He explained to the captain as he drew: Use two bamboo cables side by side, winding back and forth around two rotatable wooden axles. Dozens of baskets are tied to the cable. Once the baskets are loaded with fertilizer, using the weight of the fertilizer, it will rotate cyclically like a dragon bone waterwheel, then the fertilizer on the mountain can be continuously delivered directly to the field, right? The captain listened and nodded, adding: "You said to use two rotating wooden axles, I think that is too small, the returning baskets will collide up and down, it is better to make two wheel spokes like the waterwheel in the mill, so that the distance up and down is larger and will not cause the baskets to collide with each other. Also, whether the weight of the fertilizer can rotate these two large wheel spokes is another question."

"If it really can't rotate, we can also install ball bearings on the bearing." Old Han replied with confidence.

For several days, before dawn every day, the clang of axes echoed in the remote mountain gully, and they didn't stop work until it was completely dark. Some people were weaving cables, women were helping to weave baskets, and of course, the busiest was Han Yan. There was only one carpenter in the platoon. He not only had to do the filing and chopping himself but also had to guide others, and at night he had to carefully consider the construction problems. More than ten days of hard work passed, and a new type of cableway fertilizer transporter appeared in Fugui Gully. On the day it was assembled, everyone watched as Old Han was busy conducting experiments. The first test was basically successful, but new difficulties had not yet been resolved. That is, the machine was rotating too fast, and the fertilizer supply could not keep up; another problem was that the baskets swayed particularly badly in the middle of the journey, and the fertilizer was all dumped before it reached the destination.

That night, Old Han lay in bed, tossing and turning and unable to fall asleep, his mind always entangled in those two perplexing problems. He became a little irritable, so he simply got out of bed. In order not to wake his sleeping wife and children, he gently lit a pile of fire.

He sat beside the stove, thinking hard, the room was so quiet that only the sweet snoring of the children could be heard. The first cock crowing sounded in the distance, and as he thought, his face suddenly filled with smiles. He ran to the deputy captain's house in one breath and woke up the deputy captain, and immediately made improvements according to his ideas.

They installed a brake on the rotating wheel spoke, and the speed could be controlled by people; in order to avoid the basket swaying, a row of wooden frames was added under the cableway to keep the two cables always balanced. After another two days of modification, the second test fully demonstrated its great function, and it could transport forty dan of fertilizer every two minutes.

On the morning of December 27th, the mountains and ridges were covered with a layer of white frost, and the cold wind was biting, but Old Han was the first to arrive at the mountain gully. Because the commune organized more than eighty cadres above the captain level to come to visit today, he was not very at ease, fearing that something would go wrong, so he came early in the morning to knock and beat for a while. He didn't return to the canteen for food until he checked and thought there was no problem.

After breakfast, Han Yan personally controlled the brake, and two people were specially responsible for constantly filling the large piles of turf fertilizer into the hopper. The machine rotated very evenly. One hundred and twenty baskets carrying fertilizer poured into the field like a waterfall from the mountainside more than twenty zhang high, and in the blink of an eye, there was a large pile of fertilizer below. This time, the people watching around were overjoyed. Everyone kept shouting: "Our 'Sand Knife Carpenter' is really good, he can still think of such a good idea." "With this fertilizer transporter, even moving mountains and filling seas can be done, no longer worried about not completing the four thousand dan of fertilizer per mu." "I think it should be named 'Mountain Moving Machine'." "Yes! It should be called 'Mountain Moving Machine'."

"..." Hearing the praise, Han Yan's dark face flushed, his face full of smiles, and his heart felt sweet.

    巧干积肥
    湖南凤凰　江兰
    社务会议刚刚结束，人们都陆续的散去了。在崎岖的山路上，队长杨光元踏着朦胧的月色缓慢地走着。心想：全队二百八十来亩田，每亩要施肥四千担，那末就需要肥料一百一十多万担，而能参加积肥的只有三十多人，莫说要积，就是光把这些肥料从崎岖的山道上运往田里也够难的了。他越想越着急，最后总算找到了一个解决问题的线索，他想起了“砂刀木匠”。
    在杉木坪，“砂刀木匠”韩炎很有点威望。他为人忠厚老实，平素不大喜欢多说话。他最大的特点是脑筋灵活，肯钻研。他本来没有学过木匠活，只不过平时喜欢摸摸斧头和锉子，有时家里缺一件木器用具或者需要修补一下房子，他总是自己卷卷袖子干起来了，搞出来的东西虽不十分精致，但也能顶用。邻居们看到了间或也请他帮助修一修桌椅或补一补门窗。秋收以后，农活稍松一点，修房子的人多，也就常常被本庄的张木匠邀去当当助手。因此“砂刀木匠”这个称呼就这样叫起来了。
    去年春耕播种时，要搞合式秧田，韩炎看到社员们用手开沟，既费劲又缓慢，他一琢磨，不声不响地花了没有半天时间就制成了一架合式秧田开沟器，社员们个个拍手称好。杨队长想到这里，不由得加快了脚步，直奔韩炎家来了。
    杨光元进门来就往椅子上一坐，说明了来意。老韩听了低着头只顾抽烟，皱皱眉毛说：“积肥任务很艰巨，应该从巧干方面打主意”。他重新装上了一袋烟，一边吸一边凝视着地面出神，手里还拿了一根木棒，不时的在地上画一画，脸上时而显出了十分难解的样子。“有了，按着索道运输这个原理来改进一下就成了”。他一面画一面向队长讲解着：用两根竹缆并排地来回绕着上下两个能转动的木轴，缆索上绑着数十只畚箕，畚箕一装上肥料，利用肥料的重量，它就会像龙骨水车一样循环地转动起来，那么山上的肥料不是就能源源不断地直接送到田间去了吗？队长听了，不住地点着头，补充着说：“你说上下用两根转动的木轴，我看小了，来回的畚箕会上下相撞，不如作两个像碾房里的水车一样的车轱，这样上下的距离大了就不致使畚箕互相撞击了。还有用肥料的重量是否能够转动这样两个大车轱呢？”
    “如果实在不能转动，我们还可在轴承上装上滚珠”。老韩胸有成竹地回答着。
    几天以来，每天天不亮僻静的山坳上就响起了斧头的铿锵声，直到煞黑还没有收工。人们有的编织缆索，妇女们也帮着织畚箕，当然最忙的要算是韩炎了。排里只有一个木匠，他不仅要亲自动手锉锉砍砍，还要指点别人，晚上还得周密地考虑施工问题。十多天来的辛勤劳动过去了，一架新式的索道运肥机出现在富贵?上。装成的这一天，大家都围着看老韩忙着进行试验。第一次试验结果基本成功了，但是新的困难还没有解决，那就是机车旋转太快，上肥供应不及；另一个就是畚箕滑到中途颠簸得特别厉害，还没有到目的地肥料都统统倒掉了。
    这天晚上老韩躺在床上，翻来复去怎么也不能入睡，心里总是为那两道费解的难题纠缠着。他有些烦躁起来了，索性爬起床来。为了不吵醒熟睡的妻子和孩子们，他轻手轻脚的燃起了一堆炉火。
    他坐在炉旁苦思着，屋子里静得只能听到孩子们甜睡的鼾声。远远近近响起了第一遍鸡啼，他想着想着，脸上突然挂满了笑容。他一口气跑到副队长家里喊醒了副队长，按照他所设想的马上进行改进。
    他们在转动的车轱上装了一个煞车，快慢可以由人来操纵；为了避免畚箕颠簸，又在索道下边加上一排排木架，使两根缆索永远保持平衡。又经过了两天的修改，再次试验它的巨大功能就充分显示出来了，每两分钟就能运肥四十担。
    12月27日这天早上，满山满岭都铺上了一片白霜，寒风凛冽，老韩却第一个先来到了山坳上。因为公社今天组织了队长以上的干部八十多人前来参观，他不大放心，怕出岔子，所以一大清早又来敲敲打打搞了一阵。直到检查认为没有问题了才回到食堂吃饭。
    早饭后，韩炎亲自掌握着煞车，两个人专门负责把大堆大堆的草皮肥不断地往漏斗里填。机子就轱辘轱辘很匀称地转动起来了。一百二十只畚箕载着肥料像一道瀑布从二十多丈高的半山上倾泻到田里来，一转眼工夫下面的肥料就是大大的一堆。这一下，可把围在四边参观的人们乐坏了。大家不住地嚷着：“我们的‘砂刀木匠’真行，还能想出这样的好主意”。“有了这个运肥机，就是移山填海也能办得到，再不用愁每亩四千担肥料完不成了”。“我看应该把它命名为‘移山机’。”“对！应该叫做‘移山机’”。
    “……”听了人们的赞美，韩炎黝黑的脸庞上泛起了红晕，满脸笑容，心里感到甜丝丝的。
