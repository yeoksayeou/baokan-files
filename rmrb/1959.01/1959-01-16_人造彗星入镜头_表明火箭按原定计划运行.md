Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, January 15th: The Pulkovo Observatory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, located at the astronomical observation station in the Kislovodsk region (North Caucasus), recently sent the first photograph it took of a man-made comet to Leningrad. This photograph is considered an extremely important documentary record.

The man-made sodium cloud comet was released by a Soviet cosmic rocket at 3:57 AM Moscow time on January 3rd. The comet formed at an altitude of 113,000 kilometers above the Earth. The photograph was taken by the observatory at an altitude of 2,130 meters.

Gnevyshev, the head of this mountain astronomical observation station, also came to Leningrad. He told a TASS reporter that before the sodium cloud was released, they began photographing the portion of the sky through which the rocket's trajectory passed, and the photography work continued for some time after the sodium cloud was released. As a result, they successfully took a clear photograph recording the brightest moment of the sodium cloud itself.

Professor Mikhailov, Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, after viewing the photograph, told a TASS reporter: "This is an extremely important documentary photograph. Based on this photograph, the rocket's orbit can be determined, and it shows that the rocket is moving according to the pre-calculated trajectory."

    人造彗星入镜头
    表明火箭按原定计划运行
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：苏联科学院普尔科沃天文台设在基斯洛沃德斯克地区（北高加索）的天文观测站最近把它所摄得的第一个人造彗星的照片送到了列宁格勒，这张照片被认为是极重要的文献性照片。
    这个人造钠云彗星是苏联宇宙火箭在莫斯科时间1月3日三时五十七分发出的，彗星在离地球十一万三千公里的高空形成。照片是由这个观测站在海拔两千一百三十公尺的地方拍摄的。
    这个山地天文观测站的站长格涅维舍夫也来到了列宁格勒。他对塔斯社记者说：还在钠云发出以前，他们就开始对火箭运动轨道所经过的那部分天空进行拍照，在钠云发出以后，摄影工作还继续了一些时候。因而，成功地拍摄了一张清晰地记录着钠云本身在最明亮时的情景的照片。
    苏联科学院天文学委员会主席米哈伊洛夫教授看了这张照片后对塔斯社记者说：“这是一件极重要的文献性照片。根据这张照片可以确定火箭的轨道，并表明火箭是按照预先的计算运动的。”
