Xinhua News Agency, Havana, January 6th: The Cuban provisional government was formally sworn in in Havana on January 6th. Provisional President Urrutia arrived in the Cuban capital, Havana, yesterday.

It is reported that after entering Havana, Urrutia appointed the other members of the provisional cabinet. José Miró Cardona, the president of the Cuban Bar Association, who had been exiled, was appointed as Prime Minister of the cabinet. Armando Arte Davalos, who had just been released from political prison, was appointed as Minister of Education. Manuel Ray was appointed as Minister of Public Works, and Humberto Sori Marin was appointed as Minister of Agriculture. In a statement issued yesterday, Urrutia pointed out that his government would achieve "integrity and democracy" under the principles of the Cuban revolutionary poet José Martí. He said, "I sincerely hope that integrity in administration will become the code for Cuban government officials." The news also said that at the inauguration ceremony of the new government on the 6th, Urrutia also announced that the new government would fully guarantee American investment in Cuba and would hold free elections within a year and a half to two years.

The news says that the new government is continuing to arrest the remnants of the Batista regime. Hernán Hernández, the former head of the Havana police during the Batista era, has been captured. In addition, a number of former army officers, national police, and air force personnel of the former dictatorship have also been arrested in recent days. These people will be tried by the revolutionary military court established later. It is reported that the new government will also thoroughly reorganize the army in order to establish a people's army.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 6th: As the Cuban provisional government is formed, the U.S. government is closely watching the development of the situation in Cuba.

According to an AFP report on January 5th, Washington experts have "some unease" about the situation in Cuba because the new government supports Cuban rebel leader Castro. The news agency pointed out that American politicians believe that "judging from the members of the new Cuban government appointed by provisional president Manuel Urrutia, there is no reason to hope that the island will soon return to calm."

However, some other news from Washington indicates that some members of the U.S. Congress are asking the U.S. government to immediately recognize the Cuban provisional government. According to an AP report on January 5th, the suggestion was made by New York Democrat Congressman Adam C. Powell. His suggestions include recalling U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Smith, because he is "100 percent against Castro and was 100 percent in favor of Batista." In addition, Powell also said that he would ask the U.S. government to "grant" or "loan" the new Cuban government a sum of $200 million.

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, January 6th: The Venezuelan government has officially recognized the provisional government of Cuban President Urrutia.

It is reported that the statement was announced by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Reina Desola on the 5th. He pointed out that Venezuela is the first country to recognize the Cuban provisional government.

It is reported that Ecuador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Mexico and Peru have also successively recognized the provisional government.

    古巴临时政府正式宣誓就职
    美国一面感到不安一面想设法拉拢
    新华社6日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府6日在哈瓦那正式宣誓就职。临时政府总统乌鲁蒂亚是在昨天到达古巴的首都哈瓦那的。
    据报道，乌鲁蒂亚在进入哈瓦那以后任命了临时政府内阁的其他成员。曾经被流放的古巴律师协会主席何塞·米罗·卡多纳被任命为内阁总理，刚从政治监狱中被释放出来的阿曼多·阿特·达瓦洛斯被任命为教育部长，曼努埃尔·拉伊担任了公共工程部长，翁伯托·索里·马林被任命为农业部长。乌鲁蒂亚在昨天发表的一项声明中指出，他的政府将达到古巴革命诗人何塞·马蒂的原则下那种“廉洁和民主”。他说，“我热诚地希望，行政管理上的廉洁将成为古巴政府官员们的法规。”消息还说，在新政府6日就职的仪式上，乌鲁蒂亚还宣布，新政府将充分保证美国在古巴的投资，并将在一年半到两年内举行自由选举。
    消息说，新政府目前正在继续逮捕巴蒂斯塔政权的残余分子。巴蒂斯塔时代的哈瓦那警察局局长埃尔南·埃南德斯已经落网。另外，前独裁政府的一批陆军军官、国家警察以及空军人员也已在最近几天内被逮捕，这些人将在以后成立的革命军事法庭受审。据报道，新政府还将对陆军来一次彻底改组，以便建立人民的军队。
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：在古巴临时政府组成的同时，美国政府正在密切注视古巴局势的发展。
    据法新社5日报道，华盛顿的专家们对古巴的局势“抱着某些不安情绪”，因为新政府的人都支持古巴起义军领袖卡斯特罗。这家通讯社指出，美国政界人士认为，“从临时总统曼努埃尔·乌鲁蒂亚任命的古巴新政府成员来看，没有什么理由可以希望这个岛屿不久即将恢复平静。”
    但是，来自华盛顿的另一些消息表明，美国国会一些议员正在要求美国政府立即承认古巴的临时政府。据美联社5日报道，提出上述建议的是纽约州民主党人、众议员亚当·克·鲍威尔。他的建议包括召回美国驻古巴大使史密斯，理由是他“百分之百地反对卡斯特罗和曾经百分之百地支持巴蒂斯塔”。另外，鲍威尔还表示将要求美国政府以一笔两亿美元的款项“赠予”或“贷予”古巴新政府。
    新华社6日讯　加拉加斯消息：委内瑞拉政府已经正式承认古巴乌鲁蒂亚总统的临时政府。
    据报道，这项声明是委内瑞拉外交部长雷纳·德索拉在5日宣布的。他指出，委内瑞拉是第一个承认古巴临时政府的国家。
    据报道，厄瓜多尔、哥斯达黎加、洪都拉斯、巴拿马、墨西哥和秘鲁也都先后承认了临时政府。
