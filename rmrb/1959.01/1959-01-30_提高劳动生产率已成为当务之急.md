    Increasing Labor Productivity Has Become an Urgent Task
    We are faced with the task of further developing production. What is the main way to achieve this task? Some comrades think first of increasing the labor force. But fundamentally, the development of production, the increase of national wealth, and the corresponding improvement of people's lives can only rely mainly on the increase of labor productivity, not on other things. Especially in Shanghai, a huge industrial city with a population of more than six million in the urban area, it is particularly impossible to develop production by infinitely increasing the labor force. Now we are in the midst of a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Commune industries are also booming. Labor is in short supply in all aspects, and the main source of industrial population is in the countryside. But today, if the industrial population increases without limit, it will inevitably affect the even greater tension of rural labor, affect agricultural production, and increase the unwieldiness of Shanghai's population. Furthermore, in terms of industrial production itself, what will happen if we arbitrarily increase the number of workers without regard to needs, thinking that this will increase production? From the perspective of an enterprise, relying solely on increasing the labor force will not reduce the amount of social labor consumed per unit of product, that is, it will not increase the output per capita, and it will not be possible to create more wealth for the country. Similarly, for existing factories and enterprises, building new factories cannot solve the problem of increasing production.
    Constantly increasing labor productivity means improving the labor efficiency of workers. It is calculated by the increase in the number of products manufactured by workers in a unit of time or the reduction in the man-hours required per unit of product, that is, as Marx said: "To make a smaller amount of labor have the power to produce a larger amount of use value." Therefore, Lenin regarded increasing labor productivity as the "fundamental task of creating a social and economic system higher than the capitalist system." He believed that increasing labor productivity is, in the final analysis, "the most important and main condition for guaranteeing the victory of the new social system." China's socialist system has provided an infinitely broad space and huge possibilities for the continuous improvement of labor productivity. To build socialism and prepare conditions for the transition to communism, we must have a high level of production, and to achieve a high level of production, we must constantly improve labor productivity. Therefore, we should continue to implement the policy of fully mobilizing the masses, doing everything possible to tap potential, increasing production without increasing manpower or increasing it less, and vigorously improving labor productivity to ensure the realization of Shanghai's leap forward plan. Some comrades often think that increasing labor productivity means increasing the labor intensity of workers or relying on extending working hours. This view is a misunderstanding. Increasing labor productivity mainly does not rely on physical exertion, but on further developing the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, continuously innovating technology, improving labor proficiency, rationally organizing labor, and gradually realizing the overall mechanization of industrial enterprises.
    The commentary says: The avenues for increasing labor productivity are broad, and there is much to be done. The question is whether we can do it with great enthusiasm and dedication. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we did it seriously, and the results were very good. Shanghai's total industrial output value increased by 46.7% compared with 1957, and labor productivity increased by 26.19%. This shows that it is not a small achievement, but a great achievement. The fundamental reason lies in our superior socialist system, which provides an infinitely broad space for the development of productive forces; in the leadership of the Party, which has grasped the laws of social development and consciously adjusted the contradictions between productive forces and production relations, and between the superstructure and the economic base, ensuring the unhindered development of productive forces; and in the broad masses of the people who have responded to the Party's call, broken superstitions, and liberated their minds, so that they can better meet the objective requirements of economic laws in practice, and thus become the most active and dynamic factor in productive forces. It once again proves that developing China's social productive forces at a high speed and continuously improving labor productivity is the basic spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, embodies the fundamental interests and urgent aspirations of the people of the whole country, and is also a requirement of the objective laws of economic development in socialist countries.

### 提高劳动生产率已成为当务之急

    提高劳动生产率已成为当务之急
    我们面临着进一步发展生产的任务。这个任务主要指靠什么去实现呢？有一些同志首先想到的就是增加劳动力。可是从根本来说，生产的发展、国家财富的增加、人民生活的相应改善，只能主要依靠劳动生产率的提高，而不是其它。特别在上海，一个拥有六百多万市区人口的庞大工业城市，尤其不能依靠无限增加劳动力的办法来发展生产。现在我们正处在工农业生产全面跃进中。公社工业也在蓬勃发展。劳动力在各方面都很紧张，工业人口的主要来源在农村。但今天如果工业人口无限制的增加，就势必影响农村劳动力的更加紧张，影响农业生产，而且增加上海人口的臃肿程度。再就工业生产本身来说，如果不根据需要，任意增添工人人数，以为这样就可以增加生产，结果会怎么样呢？从一个企业来说，一味依靠增加劳动力的结果，既无从减少单位产品的社会劳动消耗量，也即无法增加按人口计算的产量，就不可能替国家创造更多的财富。同样，对已有的工厂企业来说，新建工厂也不能解决它们提高生产的问题。
    不断提高劳动生产率，就是提高劳动者的劳动效率，它是以劳动者增加在单位时间内制造的产品数量或减少单位产品所需的工时消耗来计算的，即如马克思所说的：“使较小量劳动有生产较大量使用价值的力量。”因此，列宁把提高劳动生产率作为“创造高于资本主义制度的社会经济制度的根本任务”，他认为提高劳动生产率，归根到底是“保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件”。我国的社会主义制度，已为劳动生产率的不断提高提供了无限广阔的场所和巨大可能性，我们要建设社会主义和为向共产主义过渡准备条件，就必须有高度的生产水平，要达到高度的生产水平又必须不断提高劳动生产率。所以，我们应当继续贯彻充分发动群众，千方百计挖潜力，增产不增人或少增人的方针，大力提高劳动生产率，保证上海跃进计划的实现。有一些同志常常以为提高劳动生产率，就是指提高劳动者的劳动强度或是靠延长劳动时间。这种看法是一种误解。提高劳动生产率主要不是依靠拚体力，而是依靠进一步发挥群众的干劲和智慧，不断地革新技术，提高劳动熟练程度，合理地组织劳动，逐步实现工业企业的全盘机械化。
    评论说：提高劳动生产率的门路是广阔的，是大有文章可作的，问题是我们能否十分热心、专心致力地去做。1958年的大跃进，我们认真地做了，成绩很好，上海工业总产值比1957年增长46.7％，劳动生产率增加了26.19％，这说明了不是小有可为，而是大有可为。根本原因在于我们优越的社会主义制度，替生产力的发展提供了无限广阔的场所；在于党的领导，掌握了社会发展的规律，自觉地调整了生产力与生产关系、上层建筑与经济基础的矛盾，保证了生产力不受阻碍地发展；在于广大人民群众响应党的号召，破除迷信解放思想，使他们在实践中能够更好地符合经济规律的客观要求，因而成为生产力中最积极最活跃的因素。它再一次证明了，高速度地发展我国社会生产力，不断提高劳动生产率，是党的社会主义建设总路线的基本精神，是全国人民根本利益和迫切愿望的体现，也是社会主义国家经济发展的客观规律的要求。
