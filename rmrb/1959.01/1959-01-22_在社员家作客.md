Visiting a Commune Member's Home
By Our Correspondents Li Jinting and Hu Jian

In early January, we came to the Dongting Lake Plain. We spent two days as guests in the home of an ordinary commune member of the Dongtingwei People's Commune in Xiangyin County.

I remember that in the winter of 1952, this was still a desolate island. When the peasants organized themselves to reclaim wasteland and build homes, we had been there. After agricultural cooperativization, we also celebrated the great harvest of 1955 with them. This time, we wanted to spend the new life after the people's commune with old friends.

Old acquaintances are especially warm when they meet again. Sister-in-law Yao called us to her house, and Grandpa Fan insisted on us sitting in his room. After much pulling and tugging, everyone went to the public canteen for dinner together. The canteen was small, with only seventy or eighty people eating. It was located in the center of the courtyard, and from the commune members' homes to the canteen was generally only a few dozen steps, so you didn't even need to wear rubber shoes when it rained. We walked into the canteen and saw families gathered around small tables. Each table was set with two steaming dishes and a soup. The dishes were delicious, the rice fragrant, and people were talking and laughing, eating comfortably.

After dinner, poor peasant commune member Fan Jintang pulled us toward his home. This short, sturdy middle-aged man was very familiar with us. I remember that when we visited here in 1952, Fan Jintang joined the mutual aid group with only three broken baskets. His family of four depended on government relief grain every year to survive. In recent years, he turned over the fastest in the mutual aid and cooperation movement because he worked actively. Now, he was wearing a new set of blue cotton clothes, welcoming us with a smile.

"Old Fan, I heard that you have more than 300 yuan in savings. You've really turned over quickly!"

"Yes! It's all thanks to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Our lives are really getting better and better like a short man climbing stairs. During the agricultural cooperative, there were still a few people who couldn't get enough grain. Now everyone eats for free, it really feels like a weight has been lifted from my heart."

As he spoke, we arrived at his home. He poked at the fire pit, added firewood, and quickly boiled a pot of hot, strong tea for us. He added more firewood to the stove, starting a roaring fire. We quickly dissuaded him, because we knew that firewood was very scarce in the lake area in winter. He smiled and said, "Since winter began, the commune has distributed a thousand catties of dry, hard firewood to each household, as well as rice husks and straw. This year we have plenty of firewood to burn."

As he spoke, Fan Jintang's wife, Peng Chunxiu, returned. She struck a match, lit the kerosene lamp, and the room lit up. In a large room, there was a large wardrobe, a table, and two red lacquered beds. The quilts and mosquito nets were all snow-white, and everything in the room was tidy and organized. Fan Jintang's family of seven lived in three large rooms. His seventy-eight-year-old father lived in one room, he and his wife and four children lived in one room, and there was another empty room for small furniture, plus a small kitchen.

Peng Chunxiu was a thirty-five-year-old middle-aged woman who was very good at needlework. She talked to the guests while picking up a new cotton pants to sew, which was for Lao Fan to get through the winter. Usually, this peasant woman did not talk much, but that night, we inadvertently interjected in the conversation: "Some people say that the commune is not free, what do you think?" This question set her off. Her words were like a string of firecrackers, she kept talking endlessly.

"The people's commune is very good. Only those without conscience say it is not free!" She put the cotton pants she was sewing on the table: "Since the establishment of the commune, I have sewn eight pieces of clothing for the whole family. The floral clothes worn by the youngest daughter were all sewn by me at night, and I also made seven pairs of shoes."

She became more and more enthusiastic, "If women want to talk about liberation, this time is considered a complete liberation." She vividly described the cheerful mood of women after leaving the kitchen and getting rid of the burden of children.

"Now, Lao Fan is rated as a first-grade worker, and we women do light work and are rated as fourth-grade workers. Every day when we get up, we go to the canteen, where the food is ready and waiting. After eating, we put down our chopsticks, some children go to school, and some go to kindergarten. I send my two-year-old child to the nursery and go to the field with Lao Fan carrying a hoe. We do the same work and get the same wages. Last month, Lao Fan received 4.6 yuan in wages, and I also received 2.6 yuan. The money is distributed to everyone, and they can spend it however they want, how good!"

"It's convenient for women to have some money in their hands, to go back to their mother's house, or give gifts!" She looked at Lao Fan, not wanting to say more. We repeatedly encouraged her to speak, and she then narrated with deep emotion: her mother's family was more than a hundred miles away in Dingziwan, Wangcheng County, which could be reached by boat, which was also very convenient. But in the past, firstly, there were many household chores, and she couldn't move; secondly, she didn't have any money to buy gifts, so she couldn't enter the door. So she had delayed returning to her mother's house for ten years. On December 21 last year, when wages were paid, the commune gave a holiday, and she spent more than six yuan to buy many gifts such as chicken cakes and biscuits, and happily took the children back to her mother's house for half a month before returning two days ago. Her ten-year wish was fulfilled, and she was really happy in her heart.

"If it was in the past," Peng Chunxiu said, looking at Lao Fan and stopping again. Lao Fan was a straightforward person and simply said it for her, "In the past, men did have problems with their views on women, it seemed that women were eating for nothing at home, and they would take women as punching bags at every turn. I used to have this problem too, but now, every family's husband and wife go to work together and go to night school to learn culture together, and the family is harmonious."

When Peng Chunxiu saw that her husband had broken the news, she quickly took over the conversation: "You often come to my house, you know that we are a good couple, but in the past, there were many things to do at home, and I rarely went to the fields to work. Sometimes when Lao Fan came home, the meal was not to his liking, and he would get a little angry."

Her words caused everyone to burst into laughter, because we all knew about their love story. This was something that happened twenty years ago: at that time, Peng Chunxiu was still a fifteen-year-old girl, and she followed her father's fishing boat to fish in Dongting Lake. Every day, she and Lao Fan rowed boats and netted fish together, and over time, they fell in love with each other. The marriage was all arranged, but Peng Chunxiu's father wanted the Fan family to take out two sets of cheongsam materials as a betrothal gift, but the Fan family could not afford it, and the marriage fell through. The wealthy Yi family took Peng Chunxiu away. Lao Fan was so angry at the time that he couldn't eat for several days. It wasn't until 1953, after Peng Chunxiu's man unfortunately died of illness, that the two of them got married. To this day, their story of "reunion after a broken mirror" is still popular locally.

Speaking of this marriage, the whole family was particularly excited. Fan Jintang's old father, who was sitting by the stove, had not spoken for a long time. At this time, he put down his water pipe, lifted his new robe and said, "How could we have such a good life today in the past? To say we wanted a robe, we got a robe. Back then, none of our ancestors had ever worn a robe!" His words caused another burst of laughter by the stove!

Before the laughter by the stove subsided, a cry of "Mom, Mom" came into the room. It turned out that the eldest daughter, Peixiang, who was studying in high school, the second daughter, Cuilan (these two daughters came with their mother), who was studying in elementary school, and the third daughter, Zaiying, who was in kindergarten, had returned. As soon as they entered the room, the room became even more lively. Sister-in-law Fan settled the children one by one by the stove, and Fan Jintang was busy adding firewood. Someone suggested that five-year-old Zaiying should sing a song. Fan Jintang was the first to applaud. This child was very smart and had recently learned many new songs in kindergarten. She always sang them to her parents at night when she came home. That day, Zaiying was a little shy in front of the guests, twisting and refusing to sing. Her mother urged her, "Look, this child has really never seen the world! She usually sings until late at night, but today she's shrinking back. Cuilan, you're older, take the lead and sing one for the uncles." Cuilan pulled her red scarf and first sang "Socialism is Good", then the two children sang "The People's Commune is Good", "I am a Little White Rabbit", "Butterfly! Flying so Beautiful"... singing more than ten songs in a row.

Grandpa Fan loved listening to the song "The People's Commune is Good" the most, and he coaxed his two granddaughters to sing it three times in a row. After the song was finished, the old man praised repeatedly: "Every sentence is true, the benefits of the people's commune are endless." This old man, who was born in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, was particularly excited tonight. He raised his voice and said to the children: "I have seen several dynasties, and only now have I seen such a good world. Peasants don't have to pay for food, and they get paid every month. This is something that has never been heard of since the beginning of the world. We must always remember Chairman Mao's kindness."

When the children's singing stopped, everyone began to talk with deep emotion: "In the past, some people always said that children in the countryside are stupid, how can they not be stupid if they are not taught? Now that the kindergarten has just been established for two months, the children can sing more than ten songs, not stupid at all!"

"Now that we have the people's commune, it is very convenient for children to go to school! There is nothing to worry about." Fan Jintang felt this deeply. When he was a child, his parents tried every means to send him to school for only half a year. After liberation, he went to night school every year and finally got rid of his illiteracy. His wife only had time to go to night school with him every night after the people's commune was established, and now she has finished reading two volumes of literacy textbooks. He said: "Now we have to work hard to learn culture, and it looks like our children will all be stronger than us!"

Everyone talked about many benefits of the people's commune. Fan Jintang said: "The benefits are not just these." He began to calculate: the commune has been established for three months and has already paid wages twice. In December, he received 4.6 yuan in wages, and because he worked well, he also received a 6 yuan bonus. His wife received 2.6 yuan. His father, who watched a cow, also received 1 yuan in wages. The whole family received 14.2 yuan in wages. According to the December standard, the whole family can receive more than 170 yuan in wages for the whole year. In 1957, his family did a total of 480 workdays, totaling 300 yuan in income. After taking back 4,200 catties of grain, they only got more than 40 yuan in cash. He said: "Since joining the commune, our cash income has increased several times, and our lives are getting better and better every day."

It was late at night, the children were all asleep, and everyone was talking about family matters around the stove with great interest. Fan Jintang said to his wife: "Take out some of your good pickles to treat the guests." The pickle jar in the room was opened, and Peng Chunxiu took out the pickled radishes to share with everyone. They were fragrant and crisp. We asked: "Where did you get these good pickles?" Lao Fan thought we were asking strangely. Every commune member's home here has several pickle jars. The commune distributes dozens of catties of radishes, ginger, and other vegetables to each household, allowing everyone to make pickles as they like. Peng Chunxiu has a set of good pickling skills, and she not only made pickles for the public canteen, but also made two large jars for her own family.

Roasting by the fire, eating the delicious pickles of the peasant family, and talking about family matters, it was midnight before the host sent us to the commune's guest room to sleep.

    在社员家作客
    本报记者　李进挺　胡坚
    元月上旬，我们来到洞庭湖滨平原。在湘阴县洞庭围人民公社一户普通社员家作了两天客。
    记得，1952年冬天，这里还是一片荒洲。当农民组织起来，开垦荒地，建立家园时，我们曾经去过。农业合作化后，又和他们一起欢庆过1955年的大丰收。这次，我们想去和老朋友一起过过人民公社化后的新生活。
    老熟人一见面，格外亲热。姚家大嫂叫到她家去，范家三爷又拉到他屋里去坐，拉来扯去，最后还是大家一同到公共食堂吃晚饭。食堂小，只有七、八十个人吃饭，又设在屋场中心点，从社员家里上食堂去，一般只有几十步路，下雨连胶鞋也不用穿。我们走进食堂，只见一张张小桌旁，团团地围着一家老小。每桌都摆着热气腾腾的两菜一汤，菜味鲜，米饭香，人们都有说有笑，吃得顶舒服。
    吃完饭，贫农社员范金堂拉着我们向他家走。这位矮矮个子、手膀粗壮的中年人，和我们顶熟。记得，1952年我们到这里访问时，范金堂是三只烂皮箩入互助组的，一家四口，每年度荒，还靠吃政府的救济粮。这几年在互助合作运动中因劳动积极，他翻身最快。现在，他穿着一身新的青布棉衣，满面笑容地迎着我们。
    “老范，听说你存款就有三百多元，你翻身真翻得快呀！”
    “是呀！都是搭帮毛主席、共产党，我们的生活硬是矮子上楼梯步步高升。农业社时还有少数人拿不回口粮，现在大家吃饭都不要钱了，真是搬掉心头一块大石头。”
    说着，我们到了家里。他拨开火缸，添柴火，很快煮出一壶热浓茶，给我们喝。他又向火炉里添柴，烧起熊熊的火花。我们连忙劝阻，因为我们知道湖区冬天柴火很困难。他笑着说：“入冬来，公社给每家分了一千斤干硬柴，还有谷糠、稻草，今年可有柴火烧。”
    说着，范金堂的爱人彭春秀回来了。她划了根火柴，点着煤油灯，屋里亮了。一间大房里，摆了一个大衣柜、一张桌子、两张红漆床，被子、蚊帐都雪白的，房里一切都收拾得干净有条理。范金堂一家七口，住三间大房。他七十八岁的老父亲住一间，他俩口带四个小孩住一间，另有一间房子空着，放些小家具，另外还有一间小厨房。
    彭春秀是位三十五岁的中年妇女，很会做针线。她一边陪着客人讲话，一边拿起一件新棉裤在缝，是缝给老范过冬的。平日这位农家妇女话不多，可是那天晚上，我们在谈话中无意插上一句：“有人说，公社不自由，你们觉得怎么样？”这一问，可把她火了。她的话像燃了一串鞭炮似的，说个没完。
    “人民公社好得很。只有没良心的人才说不自由！”她把缝的棉裤往桌上一摆：“搞公社以来，我连这件衣全家共缝了八件。细妹子身上穿的花衣服通通是我晚上缝的，还做了七双鞋。”
    她越谈越起劲，“我们妇女要说翻身，这次才算彻底翻了个身。”她生动地叙述了妇女走出厨房，摆脱孩子拖累后的舒畅心情。
    “现在，老范评一级劳动，我们妇女做轻活，评四级劳动。每天一起床，就往食堂走，饭菜现成的摆在那里。吃完饭，筷子一放，孩子们有的上学，有的到幼儿园。我把两岁的小孩往托儿所一送，和老范一道扛着锄头下地去。一样劳动，一样拿工资。上个月老范领四元六角工资，我也领到二元六角。钱都发到各人手里，爱怎么花就怎么花，几多好！”
    “女人家有个活钱在手头，回娘家，送人情，都方便啦！”她望望老范，不好再说下去了。我们再三鼓励她说，她才感慨深长地叙述着：她的娘家在一百多里路远的望城县丁字湾，一船就搭到了，也很方便。但是过去，一来家务事多，走不动；二来手头没有活钱，不买点东西送人情，不好进门。就这样拖了十年没回娘家。去年12月21日发工资的那天，公社放假，她用六块多钱，买了鸡蛋糕、饼干等许多礼品，高高兴兴带小孩回娘家住了半个月，前两天才回来。十年来的心愿实现了，心里实在高兴。
    “要是过去”，彭春秀话说到嘴边，望望老范又停住了。老范是个直性人，干脆代她讲了，“过去男人对女人的看法的确有问题，好像女人在家里白吃饭样的，动不动拿女人作出气筒。我过去也有这毛病，现在谁家夫妻都是双双出工，双双进民校学文化，家庭一团和气。”
    彭春秀看到丈夫把话说破了，连忙把话接回去：“你们是常到我家里来的，你们知道我们是和好夫妻，只是以前家里事多，很少下田做工夫，老范一回家，有时饭不应手，就有点发脾气。”
    她这一说，引起大家哄堂大笑，因为我们都知道他俩的一段姻缘。这是二十年前的事：当时彭春秀还是一位十五岁的姑娘，她随着父亲的渔船在洞庭湖捕鱼，每天和老范在一起划船网鱼，日子一久，彼此相爱。亲事都说好了，但是彭春秀的父亲要范家拿出两套旗袍料子做聘礼，范家拿不出来，婚事吹了。有钱的易家把彭春秀接过去了。老范当时气得几天吃不下饭。一直到1953年，彭春秀的男人不幸得病死了以后，他俩才结了婚。到今天，当地还流行着他俩“破镜重圆”的故事。
    说起这段姻缘，全家人都格外兴奋。坐在火炉边的范金堂的老父亲，很久没有开口。这时，他把水烟筒一放，掀起自己身上的新长袍说：“过去哪能有今天这样好生活，说要长袍就有长袍。那时，我们祖宗三代还没有穿过一件长袍哩！”他的话，又引起火炉边一阵欢笑！
    炉边的笑声未落，一阵“妈妈，妈妈”的喊声进了屋。原来，在高小念书的大女儿培香、在初小念书的二女翠兰（这两个女儿是随母亲来的）和在幼儿园的三女儿再英回来了。她们一进屋，屋里更热闹了。范大嫂把孩子一个个安顿在火缸边坐好，范金堂忙着添柴火。不晓得谁提议，要五岁的再英唱个歌。范金堂第一个拍手赞成。这个孩子顶聪明，最近在幼儿园学了很多新歌，晚上回家总要给爸妈唱一通。这天，再英在客人面前有些害羞，扭扭捏捏，不愿唱。她妈催促着：“你看，这孩子真没见过世面！平日唱到深夜，今天反而缩头缩脑。翠兰，你大些，带头唱一个给叔叔听。”翠兰把红领巾拉一拉，先唱了一个“社会主义好”，接着两个孩子又唱“人民公社好”、
  “我是一只小白兔”、“蝴蝶呀！飞得真美丽”……一连唱了十多个歌子。
    范大伯最爱听“人民公社好”这支歌，他逗着两个小孙女一连唱了三次。歌子唱完后，老人家连连称赞：“句句是实在的，人民公社的好处说不完。”这位清朝光绪年间出生的老年人，今晚特别兴奋，他放大嗓子对孩子们说：“我见过几个朝代，才看到今天的好世界，农民吃饭不要钱，月月发工资，这是盘古开天以来从没有听说过的事。我们要永远记住毛主席的恩情。”
    当孩子们的歌声一落，大家都感慨深长地谈论起来：“以前有些人总说农村的孩子笨，没有教他怎么不笨呢？现在幼儿园刚办起两个来月，孩子们都会唱十多个歌子，一点也不笨啦！”
    “现在有了人民公社，孩子们上学可方便啦！一切不用操心。”范金堂对这点感受很深。他小时，爷娘千方百计才送他读了半年书。解放后，年年上民校，才摘掉文盲帽子。他的爱人一直到人民公社化后，才有时间每天晚上同他一道上民校，现在也读完了两册识字课本。他说：“如今硬要发狠学文化，眼看儿女一个个都比我们强啦！”
    大家谈了人民公社许多好处，范金堂说：“好处还不只这些。”他开始算账：公社成立三个月，已发了两次工资，12月份，他领到四元六角工资，因为劳动好，还得到六元钱奖金。他爱人领二元六角。他父亲看一条牛，也领一元钱工资。全家领工资十四元二角，按12月份的标准计算，全年全家可领工资一百七十多元。1957年他家共做四百八十个劳动日，合三百元收入，除拿回四千二百斤口粮外，才进四十多元现金。他说：“入了公社又增加了几倍现金收入，我们的生活，天天往好处走。”
    夜深了，孩子们都睡熟了，大家围炉夜话，兴致勃勃谈家常。范金堂对妻子说：“你的好腌菜，拿点出来待待客人。”房里的腌菜坛子打开了，彭春秀拿出腌制的萝卜请大家吃，又香又脆，我们问：“你们哪里来的这好的腌菜？”老范倒认为我们问得奇怪。他们这里每户社员家里都有几个腌菜坛子，公社分给他们每户几十斤萝卜、洋姜等蔬菜，让大家爱怎么做就怎么腌制。彭春秀有一套制腌菜的好手艺，不仅给公共食堂做了腌菜，自己家里也做了两大坛子。
    烤着炉火，吃着农家美味可口的腌菜，谈着家常，一直到深夜十二时，主人才送我们到公社的客房里去睡觉。
