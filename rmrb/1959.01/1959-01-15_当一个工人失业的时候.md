    When a Worker Loses His Job
    By our correspondent Su Lan
        The Turley Family
    British Prime Minister Macmillan said: "We have never had it so good." For millionaires, this is absolutely true. In 1958, the dividends of more than 2,700 British companies increased by 6% compared with the previous year. However, hundreds of thousands of British working-class families have tasted the bitterness of this year.
    The Turley family is one of these hundreds of thousands of British working-class families. He is an ordinary electrical worker who was laid off by his boss eight weeks ago. When we walked into his residence, he and his wife were sitting worriedly at the table, surrounded by six children ranging in age from eighteen months to fourteen years old.
    In British families, a Christmas tree is always indispensable during Christmas. Even poor families have to buy a few bundles of pine branches. But in the Turley's home, only a few strings of red paper strips were hung on the ceiling. Of course, there was no question of buying Christmas gifts for the children. The damp and dark house, the dusty old furniture, the pieces of diapers drying on the mantelpiece, the haggard little faces of the children... all of this constituted a very desolate picture.
    Since the day Turley lost his job, he has been going out early and returning late every day, looking for work. He never buys anything to eat outside, at most drinking a cup of hot tea. In the evening, Turley always returned home hungry and disappointed.
    How does this family survive?
    "We live on meager unemployment benefits," Turley said. "For a large family like ours, it costs at least sixteen pounds a week to maintain a basic standard of living. But now we get a weekly benefit of five pounds and a multi-child allowance of two pounds and seventeen shillings. And from this income of less than eight pounds, we have to pay more than two pounds for rent each week, and one pound and sixteen shillings for installment payments for clothes. Plus expenses such as fuel and electricity, the remaining money can only buy some potatoes and bread to fill our stomachs."
    Six growing children have not tasted fruits and vegetables for a long time. In the best case, they can eat a little margarine and "Spam" (this is a meat pie of the poorest quality), because these things are relatively cheap. The clothes bought on credit have already revealed holes in the children's bodies, but the outstanding debt is still not paid off. The hardship of life forces the mother, who suffers from lung disease, to go out every day to clean houses for others.
    In his lifetime, Turley has lost his job hundreds of times. Although he has tasted enough hardships, he places his hopes on his children, hoping that their future will not be worse than their father's. But now he says: "My family can only become poorer day by day. It seems that the children can no longer study for a few more years." Turley's third boy is a top student in school. Unfortunately, growing up in such a family in this country, his intelligence seems to be superfluous.
    In Britain, there are more than just thousands of families like the Turley's! When people see coal pits being closed down, and hear that 300 textile factories have collapsed in the past year, they naturally think of the coal mining towns of Wales and the cotton cities of Lancashire, and remember how the workers there sadly put down their coal picks and left their spinning wheels, and were transformed into unemployed people like Turley in the blink of an eye.
        Who "Relieves" Whom?
    "What should I do?" This is a common cry from unemployed workers. Change jobs? This is not an easy thing. When a textile factory in Lancashire announced its closure, the female workers working in the workshop all cried when they heard the news. In this factory, more than half are female workers over 45 years old and male workers over 50 years old. Women have spent their youth in cotton-filled workshops to become skilled textile workers. Changing careers – even if they can find other jobs – is unthinkable for them. The situation for men is no better. Factories everywhere are laying off workers, where can they find work? Even Coventry, known as the most prosperous "Motor City," has several thousand unemployed workers.
    The only remaining path is to receive unemployment benefits. However, some workers would rather go to the pawn shop than beg for this meager "allowance." They consider this an insult to the workers. Because you have to queue, register, and stamp at the employment agency like a beggar. In addition, there are various restrictions. For example, regardless of the reason, if you voluntarily give up your job, unemployment benefits will be greatly reduced. If you are fired for "misconduct," you will not get a penny for at least six weeks.
    The British government seems to regard the issuance of relief as a gift to the workers. The workers say: "The wool comes from the sheep, and the government does not lose a single bit." For example, if you have paid income tax and insurance premiums for a year in the past, you can get full relief for the first thirteen weeks after unemployment, and half for the second thirteen weeks. This money is entirely the income tax and insurance premiums they paid while they were employed. The British government's calculations are very clear: after an unemployed worker receives twenty-six weeks of relief, he loses his eligibility for relief and can no longer receive half a penny. Therefore, long-term unemployment is a fatal blow to workers.
    Unemployed People Who are "Not Considered Unemployed"
    575,000 people, this is the official British unemployment figure. But hidden behind this figure are a large number of unemployed people who are "not considered unemployed." These people include tens of thousands of female workers who are not eligible for unemployment benefits, many elderly workers who still hope to continue working but are forced to retire, and more than 220,000 underemployed people.
    Of course, those unemployed dockworkers are also not included in the official figures. Because although they do not have jobs, they can get a minimum, "guaranteed" wage. However, their situation is worse than that of unemployed workers in other industries.
    Dockworker Connolly, tall and broad-shouldered, can really carry hundreds of pounds of heavy burdens. However, his whole body of energy cannot be exerted, and he spends all day standing in line outside the office of the dockworkers' labor bureau. With fewer and fewer ships, there are often more than a dozen workers waiting to handle a single piece of cargo. The labor bureau is an institution controlled by capitalists, and it has the right to decide who should undertake these meager jobs. Of course, they first pick young and strong lads, but even for strong men like Connolly, the days of standing in line are much more than the days of working. In the "London Docks," which has more than 3,000 people, almost 500 people do not get work every day.
      "Today we do not know tomorrow's fate," this is a popular saying among dockworkers. When they have queued for a day and have not done any work, the labor bureau stamps a stamp on their certificates. Dockworkers call this "Boom-pa!" If he has six "Boom-pas" in a week, he can receive a "guaranteed" wage of six pounds with these six stamps. If he works for one day a week and earns two pounds, then this "guaranteed" wage is reduced to four pounds. This money cannot be taken for nothing. Once you have a job, you must hand over 7% of your income to the labor bureau, which is the financial source of the "guaranteed" wage.
    Connolly told me that he had about six weeks of complete unemployment last year. The rest of the time, he mostly only worked one or two days a week. A weekly income of six pounds makes it impossible for him to support a family of five, so he has to live on debt. He said: "Those who are truly unemployed are more fortunate than us. Because if he has many children, he can get much more relief than six pounds. And we, no matter how many people in the family, all get six pounds."
    Of course, Connolly's experience is not the worst. How many unemployed people are "not considered unemployed," they can neither receive relief nor have a "guaranteed" wage. In this case, what other way do they have besides carrying a wooden box to the streets to shine shoes for people? (Attached picture)
    A group of dockworkers who are called "not unemployed" by the British government are walking towards the Royal Docks in London waiting for "Boom-pa." A member of the Seaport Workers Liaison Committee is calling on them to carry out a tenacious struggle for employment.

    当一个工人失业的时候
    本报记者　苏蓝
        泰尔利的一家
    英国首相麦克米伦说：“我们的光景从来没有这么好过。”对于百万富翁来说，这是千真万确的事情。在1958年，英国二千七百多个公司的红利，比前一年增加了6％。但是，成千上万个英国工人家庭，却在这一年中尝尽了痛苦。
    泰尔利的一家，就是这成千上万个英国工人家庭中的一个。他是一个普通的电气工人，在八个星期之前被老板解雇了。当我们走进他的住处时，他和他的妻子正忧愁地坐在桌旁，围绕着他们的是从十八个月到十四岁的六个孩子。
    在英国的家庭中，过圣诞节时总少不了一棵圣诞树。贫困的人家也得买几束松枝。可是在泰尔利家里，却只在天棚上挂了几串红色纸条。当然，更谈不上为孩子们买圣诞礼物了。潮湿而阴暗的房子，布满灰尘的旧家具，烘在壁炉架上的一片片尿布，孩子们一张张憔悴的小脸……，这一切构成了一副十分凄凉的图景。
    从泰尔利失业的那天起，他每天都是早出晚归，寻找工作。他在外面从不买东西吃，顶多喝一杯热茶。到了晚上，泰尔利总是饿着肚皮、怀着失望回到家里。
    这一家人如何生活下去？
    “我们靠微不足道的失业救济金过日子，”泰尔利说。“像我们这样一个大家庭，要维持起码的生活，每周至少要花费十六英镑。但是，现在得到的是每周五英镑的救济金和二英镑十七先令的多子女补助费。而从这不到八英镑的收入中，每周要付两英镑多的房租，一英镑十六先令的以分期付款购买衣服的欠债。再加上燃料、水电等开支，剩下来的钱只能买些土豆、面包来充饥。”
    六个正在成长的孩子，已经很久没有尝到水果、青菜的味道了。在最好的情况下，他们可以吃到一点人造牛油和“斯派姆”（这是一种质量最差的肉饼），因为这些东西比较便宜。以赊购办法买来的衣服，已经在孩子们身上露出了一个个破洞，但赊购的欠款仍未还清。生活的艰难，逼使患着肺病的母亲每天外出为别人打扫房子。
    在泰尔利的一生中，已经失去工作上百次，他虽然尝够了艰难困苦的滋味，但却把希望寄托在孩子们身上，盼望他们的前途不会比爸爸更坏。可是现在他说：“我这个家只能一天天贫困下去。看来，孩子们不可能再多念几年书了。”泰尔利的第三个男孩，是学校中的优等生，不幸，生长在这个国家的这么一个家庭中，他的聪明似乎是多余的了。
    在英国，像泰尔利这样的家庭，何止万千！当人们看到一个个煤坑被关闭的时候，听到过去一年内有三百个纺织厂垮台的时候，就很自然地联想到威尔斯的煤矿镇和兰开夏的棉花城，想起了那里的工人如何伤心地放下自己的煤镐，离开自己的纺车，转眼变成像泰尔利一样的失业者。
        谁“救济”谁？
    “我该怎么办？”这是失业工人发出的一个共同声音。转业吧？这不是件容易的事情。当兰开夏的一个纺织工厂宣布关闭时，正在车间工作的女工们，听到这个消息后全都哭了。在这个工厂内，一半以上是四十五岁的女工和五十岁以上的男工。妇女们在棉絮飞扬的车间中消磨掉自己的青春，才成为一个熟练的纺织工人。改行——即使能找到其它工作——对她们是不可设想的。男人的情况也不比她们好。到处的工厂在解雇工人，到哪儿去找工作？被称为最繁荣的“汽车城”考文垂，也有好几千工人失了业。
    剩下来的唯一道路，是领救济金。但是，有些工人却宁愿进当铺，而不愿去乞求这笔少得可怜的“津贴”。他们认为这是对工人的污辱。因为你必须像叫化子一样地到职业介绍所去排队、登记、盖印。此外还加上种种限制。例如，不管什么原因，如果是自动放弃工作，失业救济金就要大大减少。如因“行为不正”而被开除，那么至少六个星期得不到一个铜板。
    英国政府把发放救济金似乎看作对工人的恩赐。工人们说：“羊毛出在羊身上，政府没吃一点亏。”比如说，你过去曾交了一年的所得税和保险费，在失业之后，第一个十三个星期你可以得到充分的救济金，第二个十三个星期就减少了一半。这些钱，完全是他们在业时所纳的所得税和保险费。英国政府的算盘打得一清二楚：当一个失业工人领了二十六个星期的救济金后，他就丧失了被救济的资格，再也领不到半个铜子了。所以，长期的失业，是对工人致命的打击。
    “不算失业”的失业者
    五十七万五千人，这是英国官方公布的失业数字。但是，隐藏在这个数字后面的，是大量的“不算失业”的失业者。这些人，包括成千上万的、没有资格领取救济金的女工，许多仍然希望继续工作，但却被强令退休的老年工人，以及二十二万以上的半失业者。
    当然，那些失业的码头工人，也不在官方数字之列。因为他们虽然没有工作，却可以得到起码的、“有保证的”工资。然而，他们的处境，却比其他行业的失业工人更坏。
    码头工人康纳利，高大的身干，宽阔的肩膀，真可以扛起几百斤的重担。可是，他浑身的精力没法使出去，成天在码头工人劳工局的办公室外面去站队。在船只愈来愈少的情况下，常常有十几个工人等待着搬运一件货物。劳工局是资本家控制的机构，它有权决定：这些少得可怜的工作由谁来承担。他们当然先挑年轻力壮的小伙子，但是，即使像康纳利这样的壮汉，站队的日子也要比工作的日子多得多。在拥有三千多人的“伦敦码头”上，每天几乎有五百多人得不到工作。
      “今天不知明天的命运”，这是码头工人中流行的一句话。当他们排了一天队，没有一点工作干的时候，劳工局就在他们的证件上盖一个戳子。码头工人把这叫做“嘭啪”！一个星期如果有六个“嘭啪”，他就可以凭这六个戳子领到六英镑的“有保证的”工资。如果一个星期工作了一天，挣到了两英镑，那么这
  “有保证的”工资便减少为四英镑。这些钱是不能白拿的。当你一旦有了工作时，必须把自己收入的7％交给劳工局，这就是“有保证的”工资的财政来源。
    康纳利告诉我，他在去年一年内，大约有六个星期完全没有工作。其余时间，大多数是一星期只工作一两天。每周六英镑的收入使他无法扶养五口之家，所以不得不举债度日。他说：“那些真正的失业者要比我们幸运。因为如果他子女多的话，他就可以得到比六英镑多得多的救济金。而我们，不管一家多少人口，一律六英镑。”
    像康纳利这样的遭遇，当然不能算是最坏的。多少个“不算失业”的失业者，他们既不能领到救济金，又没有“有保证的”工资。在这种情况下，他们除了背一只木箱子到街头去给人擦皮鞋以外，还有什么办法呢？（附图片）
    一群被英国政府称为“不算失业”的码头工人正走向伦敦的皇家码头等候“嘭啪”。一个海港工人联络委员会的委员正呼吁他们进行顽强的就业斗争。
