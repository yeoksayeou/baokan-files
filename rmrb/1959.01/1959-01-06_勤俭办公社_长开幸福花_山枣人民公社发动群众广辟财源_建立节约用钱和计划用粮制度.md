According to a report from the New Hunan Daily: The Party Committee of the Shanzao People's Commune in Xiangxiang County recently conducted a broad and in-depth education on running the commune diligently and frugally throughout the entire commune. It also adopted measures to establish a system for saving money and planning grain consumption, opening up sources of income widely, and launching a movement to run the commune diligently and frugally and love the commune like home, greatly promoting current production.

In 1958, Shanzao Commune's grain production increased by 1.36 times compared to 1957, and the total value of industrial and agricultural output increased by 1.84 times. After the establishment of the commune, the vast majority of cadres and members continued to live diligently, frugally, and carefully. However, a few cadres and masses were unclear about the relationship between production, accumulation, and consumption. They believed that "we have had a bumper harvest, with plenty of money and grain, so there is no need to be frugal." As a result, they were extravagant with money and grain. In September, the 4,260 people in the Yanjing Brigade consumed more than 390,000 catties of rice, averaging 93 catties per person. Some commune members also did not take good care of agricultural tools.

In response to these situations, the Commune Party Committee carefully analyzed and studied them. It decided to conduct an education on running the commune diligently and frugally throughout the commune, raising the questions: "With a bumper harvest, should we broaden sources of income and save grain? Should we adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally?" A great debate was launched to make everyone understand the correct relationship between production, accumulation, and consumption, and to inspire everyone to calculate several accounts: First, the living expenses account. If all 35,000 people in the commune consumed grain like the Yanjing Brigade, eating 93 catties per person per month, they would consume more than 1,100 catties per year, far exceeding the national grain ration standard. Second, the current production account. Current expenses for water conservancy construction alone would cost the commune several tens of thousands of yuan. Third, the next year's production fund account. Production costs for seeds, fertilizers, and diversified operations alone would require more than 450,000 yuan. Fourth, the wage account. If each person in the commune received an average monthly wage of only two yuan, it would require more than 38,000 yuan. Fifth, the commune income account. In November, the cash income from sideline occupations was only more than 29,000 yuan. Through these calculations, everyone deeply realized that although the commune was large and prosperous, its expenses were also large, and it was imperative to broaden sources of income and implement the principle of running the commune diligently and frugally. During the propaganda and education, the good example of the Xiangsi Squad of the Xishan Brigade in saving expenses was also praised. This squad spent only 2.60 yuan on office expenses in three months. Through this movement, 8,034 out of 8,113 households in the entire commune signed the "Diligently Run the Commune, Love the Commune Like Home" pact.

Subsequently, the commune organized a large army for diversified production, identifying 17 avenues such as bamboo and wood, fish farming, and pig raising. It is estimated that by the end of February, a total of 830,000 yuan in cash income could be generated. In addition, a group of laborers was transferred to support industrial construction, with a monthly wage income of 60,000 yuan. The Commune Financial Clearing Committee, through checking accounts, warehouses, and physical objects, also found 370,000 catties of grain and 27,000 yuan in various physical objects and cash that had not been included in the income account before. On this basis, the Commune Party Committee formulated interim measures for financial management, income and expenditure plans, grain consumption standards, material storage, and various necessary systems. It also greatly reduced non-productive expenditures. The commune's infrastructure construction was carried out according to the principle of making do with whatever was available. Everyone in the commune consumed grain according to the plan, and it was stipulated that staple grains could not be used for brewing wine. Grain and sweet potatoes were properly stored to prevent mildew and rot. Agricultural tools and other properties were inventoried and stored in warehouses, with designated personnel responsible for their safekeeping.

Currently, cadres and the masses have a further understanding of running the commune diligently and frugally. Originally, the commune planned to build a pig farm, which required 20,000 yuan. Now, through careful calculations and making do with whatever was available, it was built for only 133 yuan. The entire commune's management fee from September to December was only 430 yuan. All canteens have implemented planned grain consumption, and commune members not only eat well but also eat their fill. Commune members are in high spirits and have great enthusiasm for production. In six days, they carried out a topdressing fertilizer application on 4,000 mu of wheat and 9,200 mu of rapeseed, and recently launched a high tide of manure accumulation.

    勤俭办公社
    长开幸福花
    山枣人民公社发动群众广辟财源
    建立节约用钱和计划用粮制度
    据新湖南报消息　中共湘乡县山枣人民公社党委会，最近在全社进行了广泛深入的勤俭办社教育，并采取措施，建立节约用钱、计划用粮的制度，广开财源，掀起了一个勤俭办社、爱社如家的运动，大大推动了当前生产。
    1958年，山枣公社的粮食比1957年增加了一点三六倍，工、农业总产值增长一点八四倍。公社成立后，绝大多数干部和社员仍然勤勤俭俭、精打细算的过日子。但是，也有少数干部和群众对生产、积累和消费的关系搞不清，他们认为“大丰收了，钱多、粮足，用不着节约了”，在用钱用粮上就大手大脚。盐井大队四千二百六十人在9月份一个月就用掉稻谷三十九万多斤，每人平均吃了九十三斤。部分社员对农具的保管也不够好。
    公社党委针对这些情况，仔细作了分析和研究。决定在全社进行一次勤俭办社的教育，提出：“大丰收了，要不要广开财源，节约用粮，要不要坚持勤俭办社的原则？”开展大鸣大放大辩论，使大家认识到生产、积累和消费的正确关系，并启发大家算了几笔账：一是生活开支账，全社三万五千多人，如果都按盐井大队那样吃粮，每人每月吃九十三斤，一年要吃一千一百多斤，大大超过国家规定口粮标准。二是当前生产账，当前兴修水利等费用，全社就需好几万元。三是明年生产资金账，仅种子肥料及多种经营等生产费用，就需四十五万多元。四算工资账，如果全社每人每月仅平均发工资二元，就需三万八千多元。五算公社收入账，11月的副业现金收入，仅二万九千多元。通过算账以后，大家深深认识了公社虽然家大业大，可是开支也大，非广开财源、贯彻执行勤俭办社的原则不可。在宣传教育中，还表扬了西山大队相思中队节约开支的好榜样。这个中队三个月只用去办公费二元六角。通过这次运动，全公社八千一百一十三户有八千零三十四户订了“勤俭办社，爱社如家”的公约。
    接着，公社组织多种经营生产大军，找出竹木、养鱼、喂猪等十七项门路，预计到2月底，共可收入现金八十三万元；此外，抽调一批劳力支援工业建设，每月工资收入有六万元。公社财务清理委员会通过查账、查库、查实物，又找出以前没有列入收入账的粮食三十七万斤，各种实物、现金二万七千多元。在这一基础上，公社党委制订了财政管理暂行办法、收支计划、用粮标准、物资保管以及各种必要的制度，还大大地节省非生产费用的开支。公社的基建按因陋就简的原则来进行。全社的人都按计划用粮，规定不能用主粮煮酒等。粮食、红薯都保管好，防止霉烂。农具等财产清点入库，专人负责保管。
    目前，干部和群众对勤俭办社都有了进一步的认识。原来公社准备建立猪场，需要二万元，现在精打细算，因陋就简办事，只用了一百三十三元就建成了；全公社管理费从9月到12月，只开支四百三十元；全部食堂都推行了计划用粮，社员不但吃得好，也吃得饱。社员情绪很高，生产劲头也大，六天时间内对四千亩小麦、九千二百亩油菜普遍进行一次追肥，最近又掀起积肥高潮。
