    Collective Production as the Main Focus, Individual Production as a Supplement
    Wuqiao County's Hog Population Increases by 68%
    (Our Newspaper) Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, in developing its hog raising industry, has implemented the principle of focusing on collective production by the people's communes and supplementing it with individual production by commune members, encouraging commune members to raise a certain number of hogs without affecting collective labor. The following measures have been determined: 1. The commune provides each hog with 120 jin of concentrated feed, and at the same time calls on commune members to not return empty-handed from the fields, utilizing rest time to gather pigweed and collect and store roughage. 2. The manure accumulated by commune members raising hogs individually will be purchased by the commune at a reasonable price based on quality and quantity. 3. Hogs raised by commune members, except for those voluntarily contracted for sale, are all at the disposal of the raisers themselves.
    Regarding the collective hog production of the communes, the county party committee has proposed strengthening ideological leadership and technical guidance for the breeders, striving for hog production to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Production teams and public canteens raising hogs are assigned a certain commodity production task by the commune, with the excess used to improve the lives of the commune members.
    After the people's communes implemented the principle of focusing on collective production and supplementing it with individual production, hog production developed rapidly. In the past two months, the number of hogs has increased from more than 75,000 to more than 126,000, an increase of 68%. Due to the large increase in the number of hogs raised, Wuqiao County has completed its hog transfer task for the second half of 1958. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has also greatly increased. From September to December 1958, the county accumulated 1.5 billion jin of manure, exceeding the total amount accumulated in the previous eight months.

    集体生产为主　个人生产为辅
    吴桥县生猪增加68％
    本报讯　河北省吴桥县在发展养猪事业中，实行以公社集体生产为主、社员个人生产为辅的原则，鼓励社员在不影响集体劳动的条件下，养一定数量的猪。并确定：一、公社供给每口猪一百二十斤精饲料，同时号召社员下地背筐不空回，利用休息时间打猪草，采集和储备粗饲料。二、社员个人养猪积的肥料，公社按质按量以合理价格收买。三、社员养的猪，除了自愿订立了合同的应当按照合同出售以外，一律由饲养者自己支配。
    对于公社的集体养猪生产，县委提出要对饲养人员加强思想领导和技术指导，力争生猪生产达到多快好省。生产队和公共食堂养猪，由公社给他们分配一定的商品生产任务，超额部分用作改善社员的生活。
    各人民公社执行了集体生产为主、个人生产为辅的原则以后，生猪生产发展很快，两个多月来，已由七万五千多口增加到十二万六千多口，增加了68％。由于养猪数量大增，吴桥县已完成了1958年下半年生猪外调任务。积肥数量也大大增加了，从1958年9月到12月，全县就积圈肥十五亿斤，超过了前八个月积肥的总和。
