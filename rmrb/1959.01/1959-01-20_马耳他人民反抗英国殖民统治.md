    Maltese People Resist British Colonial Rule

    Malta, located in the central Mediterranean Sea, has been a British colony since 1800. After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the island became an important stop for Britain's passage to the East, with a strong naval base established there. For more than 150 years, British colonizers have only built large-scale docks to serve the British Navy, resulting in the malformed and backward economic development of Malta. Of Malta's 330,000 population, about half depend on British dockyards for their livelihood, and the grain produced is only enough for the island's residents for three weeks, almost entirely dependent on imports, and there are no industrial enterprises.

    The people of Malta have long waged a heroic struggle against British colonialists, especially after the rise of national liberation movements everywhere after World War II. In 1947, British colonialists were forced to allow Malta to implement a so-called "constitution," giving residents the right to elect a legislative assembly and form an autonomous government with certain powers. This concession by the British government did not satisfy the demands of the Maltese people, so the struggle has not stopped. In 1956, the Suez Canal was nationalized by Egypt, and for British colonialists, Malta's strategic position was no longer as important as before. Therefore, in 1957, the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd announced plans to close the naval dockyards on the island, his reason being: "Britain needs to save some money to develop the hydrogen bomb" (Reuters). On December 30, 1957, the Maltese Legislative Assembly unanimously resolved that if the British government did not resettle the unemployed dockworkers, it would sever all relations with Britain. The British colonialists actually rejected this resolution, completely disregarding the legitimate demands of the Maltese people. Moreover, in the spring of 1958, when the Prime Minister of Malta and leader of the Labour Party, Mintoff, went to London to negotiate this issue, it also ended in failure, leading to Mintoff's resignation in April. The people of Malta clearly understood from this series of events that the only correct path was to achieve complete independence, and therefore, strikes and demonstrations against British colonial rule, attacks on police stations, setting up roadblocks everywhere, and sabotaging British military transportation, were constantly launched throughout the island. On April 30, the British authorities declared a "state of emergency" on the entire island.

    From November 19, 1958, delegations from three Maltese political parties (the Labour Party, the right-wing Nationalist Party, and the left-wing Democratic Nationalist Party) once again went to London to negotiate the future status of Malta and firmly demanded independence. However, the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd not only refused to discuss this issue but also threatened to revoke the 1947 constitution. Negotiations between the two sides broke down after several weeks. The British colonialists then intensified their suppression activities.

    On January 6 this year, the British Colonial Office brazenly announced the abolition of Malta's current constitution, thereby placing the island under the direct rule of the British Governor. This decision is about to be sent to the British Parliament for approval. Once the current constitution is abolished, all powers of the original parliament and government will be transferred to the British Governor, who will then use a so-called "Consultative Council" appointed by himself to wield power.

    This arrogant measure by the British government has aroused anger and protest from all levels of the Maltese people. On the 11th of this month, a mass rally of 4,000 people was held in Valletta, demanding complete independence for Malta. The trade union newspaper "Torch" called on union members on January 8 to fight for freedom and said that they must "break the chains of slavery and British colonial tyranny." Several major political parties in Malta, the Labour Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Democratic Nationalist Party, have all refused to participate in the so-called "Consultative Council" to be appointed by the British Governor. These parties unanimously pointed out that only traitors to Malta would participate in this "Consultative Council." The British government's colonial rule and its brutal suppression have been met with increasing resistance from the Maltese people.

    马耳他人民反抗英国殖民统治
    马耳他岛，在地中海中部，从1800年起成为英国的殖民地。在1869年苏伊士运河通航后，这个岛屿就成了英国通向东方的重要中途站，在这里设立了强大的海军基地。一百五十多年来，英国殖民者只是建筑了大规模的船坞为英国海军服务，所以马耳他岛的经济生活畸形发展，非常落后。在马耳他岛三十三万人口中，一半左右靠英国的船坞为生，所产粮食仅足岛上居民三个星期之需，几乎全部要依赖进口，而且没有任何工业企业。
    马耳他岛人民长期以来同英国殖民者进行了英勇的斗争，特别是在第二次世界大战以后到处兴起民族解放运动的时候，英国殖民者曾于1947年被迫允许马耳他岛实行所谓“宪法”，居民有权选举立法议会并成立有一定权力的自治政府。英国政府的这种让步并不能满足马耳他岛人民的要求，所以斗争迄未停止。1956年苏伊士运河为埃及收归国有，对英国殖民者来说，马耳他岛的战略地位不如以前重要了。所以，1957年，英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德曾宣布准备封闭岛上的海军船坞，他的理由是：“英国需要节省出一些钱用来发展氢弹”
  （路透社）。1957年12月30日，马耳他岛立法议会曾一致决议，如果英国政府不安插失业的船坞工人，即将断绝同英国的一切关系。英国殖民者竟然拒绝了这个决议，完全不顾马耳他岛人民的正当要求。而且在1958年春，马耳他岛政府总理、工党领袖明托夫到伦敦谈判这一问题时，也以失败告终，并导致了明托夫于4月间的辞职。马耳他岛人民从这一系列事件中清楚地知道，只有取得完全独立才是正确的道路，因而在全岛各地不断掀起反抗英国殖民统治的罢工和示威运动，袭击警察局，到处设置路障，破坏英军的交通。4月30日，英国当局宣布全岛处于“紧急状态”。
    从1958年11月19日起，马耳他岛三个政党（工党、右翼的国民党和左翼的民主国民党）代表团再次赴伦敦谈判马耳他岛的未来地位问题，并且坚决要求独立。但是英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德不仅拒绝讨论这一问题，而且威胁着要取消1947年的宪法。双方谈判数星期后破裂。英国殖民者于是加强了镇压活动。
    今年1月6日，英国殖民部悍然宣布废除马耳他岛的现行宪法，因而也就使这个岛屿处于英国总督的直接统治之下。这个决定即将送到英国议会通过，一旦现行宪法废除，原有议会和政府的所有权力都将移交英国总督，而总督则利用他自己任命的所谓“协商委员会”来掌握大权。
    英国政府的这一蛮横措施已经激起了马耳他岛各阶层人民的愤怒和抗议。本月11日，在瓦莱塔举行了一次有四千人参加的群众大会，要求给予马耳他岛以完全的独立。工会报纸“火炬报”1月8日曾号召工会会员为自由而战，并说必须“打破奴役和英国殖民暴政的锁链”。马耳他岛的几个主要政党：工党、国民党和民主国民党都表示拒绝参加将由英国总督任命的所谓“协商委员会”。这几个政党一致指出，只有马耳他岛的叛徒才会参加这个“协商委员会”。英国政府的殖民统治和它的残酷镇压，已经遭到马耳他岛人民日益增强的反抗。
