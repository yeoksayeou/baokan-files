Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: A high tide is rising in Liaoning Province's agricultural water conservancy construction movement. Currently, over 600,000 water conservancy construction workers across the province are braving temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius for intense construction. To date, the province has completed or is building over 700 reservoirs and ponds, and has dug over 3,500 wells and springs. The completed projects will expand the irrigated area by over 255,000 mu.

As early as last October, various regions, combined with the autumn harvest and deep plowing, formulated plans and prepared in terms of ideological mobilization and construction materials. Therefore, the start of construction was generally two or three months earlier than in previous years. To strengthen leadership over the agricultural water conservancy construction movement, Party committees at all levels formed agricultural water conservancy construction headquarters headed by secretaries. Due to good preparation and ideological mobilization, the Andong Special District's first batch of 82,000-strong water conservancy construction corps had already started entering the battle in mid-November, enabling simultaneous construction at over 300 water conservancy projects throughout the district.

During the agricultural water conservancy construction movement, all regions have tightly grasped the great technical revolution, vigorously promoted tool reform, and launched a high work efficiency movement to solve the problem of labor shortage. So far, more than 500,000 pieces of advanced construction tools have been popularized and used throughout the province, over 6,100 kilometers of earth transport tracks have been built, and over 10,000 meters of aerial cableways have been erected. These tools have played a significant role in the current construction, resulting in many high work efficiency red flags.

In the water conservancy construction movement, Party organizations at all levels have paid special attention to political and ideological work and the lives of the masses. Zhangwu, Heishan and other counties have established a system of close cooperation between the front and rear in water conservancy construction, with the rear supplying whatever the front needs. The food on the water conservancy construction sites in Heishan County is always hot, ensuring that all the migrant workers participating in the construction are at ease and satisfied.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: Water conservancy sites in Guangdong Province are vigorously carrying out a construction technology revolution and launching a high work efficiency movement to solve the current contradictions of labor and equipment shortages in water conservancy construction.

The construction efficiency of the more than 2,000 water conservancy projects currently under construction in Guangdong Province varies greatly. Some are progressing quickly, while others are progressing slowly. In response to this situation, the province, special districts, and many county water conservancy departments have continuously organized on-site observation and held on-site meetings over the past month to comprehensively promote the high work efficiency experience of advanced regions and advanced construction sites.

In promoting advanced experience, Guangdong Province first focused on the "digging, loading, transporting, unloading, and compacting" link, which accounts for the largest workload in earthwork projects, and comprehensively reformed tools and operating methods. Xuwen County, which started the water conservancy technology revolution movement earlier, has increased the total earthwork completed by more than eleven times in late November last year compared with the same period of the previous year due to large-scale tool reforms. The average work efficiency of the water conservancy projects under construction in this county has recently increased by more than ten times compared with the initial stage of construction. After learning the high work efficiency construction experience of advanced construction sites, the earth and stone work efficiency in some construction sites in Shantou, Zhanjiang, Foshan and other special districts has also been rapidly improved.

In carrying out the high work efficiency movement, various regions have actively sought ways to solve the shortage of equipment. Many water conservancy construction sites in Zhanjiang, Foshan and other special districts have adopted the method of relying on the masses and self-reliance to solve this problem, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and making their own soil equipment. Many regions have set up explosive factories, sulfur factories, soil nitrate factories, bamboo reinforcement factories, iron factories, wood factories, lime factories, and cement factories to implement on-site factory production. As of recently, the province has established more than 370 cement factories and more than 960 explosive factories, producing more than 10,000 tons of high-grade and low-grade cement and more than 4,000 tons of explosives. Many regions have organized professional teams to rush to manufacture equipment in large quantities using various methods, and have also adopted substitute raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th: Changde County, Hunan Province, has significantly improved work efficiency by vigorously reforming tools in water conservancy construction. Since the beginning of November last year, 100,000 migrant workers in the county have completed more than 12.7 million cubic meters of earthwork, with an average of 21.3 cubic meters per person per day, which is six times higher than the highest work efficiency during the winter repair in 1957.

The earthwork task for water conservancy construction in Changde County this winter and spring is a total of more than 33 million cubic meters. After the completion of all water conservancy projects, the reservoir area will be 100,000 mu, which can irrigate 500,000 mu of farmland, ensuring a good harvest even in severe droughts. In order to complete this task on schedule, Party committees at all levels in the county have fully mobilized and relied on the masses to vigorously reform tools, so that work efficiency has been continuously improved. Technical innovation groups have been established in all communes and production teams, doing, trying, and promoting in large quantities after mass appraisal. Wood and iron factories have been established everywhere on the water conservancy construction sites. According to statistics, there are 175 wood factories in all construction sites in the county, and all kinds of tools can be made and repaired by themselves, and what you want is what you get. As of mid-December last year, the county has manufactured more than 83,500 earth-moving tools and more than 6,800 tamping and earth-digging tools. The migrant workers have confidence that they will complete the task of water conservancy construction in the county ahead of schedule in late January.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 9th: The 100,000-strong water conservancy construction army in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, has vigorously carried out a technical revolution, basically realizing soil mechanization. The construction efficiency has increased from an average of 1.7 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day in the past to 4.5 cubic meters of earthwork, creating a new situation of rapid winter water conservancy construction under unfavorable conditions of three-foot-deep frozen soil.

It is difficult to carry out water conservancy construction in the severe winter at 45 degrees north latitude. Therefore, at the beginning of this water conservancy construction, there were three arguments among the grassroots cadres and the masses: one was to camp on the construction site and work hard day and night, attempting to solve the problem by simply extending working hours; another was to mobilize the entire Party and the entire people to stop other work and focus on water conservancy construction; the third was to work hard, diligently, and cleverly, mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out a technical revolution, reduce labor intensity, and accelerate the progress of the project.

The Wuchang County Party Committee handed over these three arguments to the cadres and the masses for debate, so that most people realized that simply extending working hours could not last, and mobilizing the entire people would inevitably affect the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and only relying on the masses to carry out technical revolution was the best policy. On the basis of unifying the understanding of the cadres and the masses in the county, the secretary and county head of the Wuchang County Party Committee went deep into four construction sites, including the Hongqi Canal and the Longfengshan Reservoir, which were relatively arduous projects, to mobilize the masses to carry out technical revolution pilot projects, and summarized and promoted the experience of the pilot projects. Then, a vigorous technical revolution movement was carried out vigorously on all water conservancy construction sites in the county. Various construction sites used the characteristics of frozen soil being lumpy, firm and brittle, and adopted the highly efficient comprehensive blasting method; the impact-type soil splitting device manufactured by indigenous methods improved the efficiency of manual soil extraction by more than ten or even dozens of times.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: The construction site in the Xin Ding Basin, one of the five major basins in Shanxi Province, stretching from Lujiachuang in the west to Zhen'anzhai in the east for twenty-one villages, is bustling and lively, and more than 17,000 farmers are digging a hundred-mile "canal" that is five feet wide and nine feet deep, so that the two rivers in the basin - Yunzhong River and Muma River - can join hands. At the same time, six reservoirs and man-made lakes, such as the Mijiazhai and Yulonggou, with a storage capacity of more than 37.7 million cubic meters, have also started construction. The Jiehepou Reservoir, which can store 280 million cubic meters of water at a time, is also undergoing tense preparations before construction. According to statistics, in addition to the general projects undertaken by the communes themselves, the seven key projects directly commanded by the county have already put 22,000 people into the battle and have completed more than 219,000 cubic meters of earth and stone works.

According to the proposed plan, after "one year of assault, one year of sweeping up" to the final year of "three years of hard work", the entire basin's water conservancy projects will be connected into a complete system, and the water in each place can be freely transferred to supplement the deficiencies, both storage and drainage, and heavy rains once every twenty years will not cause disasters, and a good harvest will be guaranteed even without rain for one year. At the same time, the soil alkalization in the basin will also be greatly restricted, and some saline-alkali and damp land can also be rationally used, turning light alkali land into fertile fields through drainage, and adding water to heavily alkaline land to grow paddy fields. In addition, the drop in water can be used to generate electricity, and the lakes and ponds can be used to raise fish and plant lotus, and trees can be planted on both sides of the canals, and rivers and main canals can be used for shipping.

This beautiful vision attracts the vast people of the basin. Therefore, after the local Party committee put forward the call to realize the river network, the water conservancy construction professional teams from all directions rushed to the construction site to launch a warm labor competition. The "living dragon kings" and "competition for Yu the Great" who once broke the "dragon king's head" and extracted the "dragon's mouth water" in the initial water conservancy are now showing their magical powers in the new battle. In order to fight against the severe cold, the labor armies of various communes have also generally adopted the construction method of "concentrating forces and breaking through each one", opening the frozen cover on a section of land on which day, and completing all the engineering on this section of land on that day. Recently, the river network project headquarters has held two on-site meetings on the construction sites of the Dongfeng Commune and the Rocket Commune, and an even further high work efficiency movement is being launched here.

    提高工效　保证质量　节约人力
    水利战线上技术大革命
    辽宁、广东、湖南、黑龙江、山西千军万马实干巧干
    本报沈阳9日电　辽宁省农田水利建设运动正在步入高潮。现在，全省每天有六十多万水利建设队伍，冒着摄氏零下二十度的严寒，紧张施工。到目前止，全省已经建成或正在施工的水库、塘坝有七百多座，打井、挖泉三千五百多眼。全省已经完成的工程可以扩大灌溉面积二十五万五千多亩。
    早在去年10月，各地即结合秋收、深翻地，制订了规划，并从思想发动、施工器材等方面进行了准备，因此开工时间一般都比往年提早两三个月。为了加强对农田水利建设运动的领导，各级党委都组成了以书记为首的农田水利建设指挥部。安东专区由于准备工作和思想发动做得好，第一批由八万二千人组成的水利建设兵团，从去年11月中旬就已经陆续开始投入了战斗，使全区三百多处水利工程同时动工。
    在农田水利建设运动中，各地都紧紧抓住了大闹技术革命、大搞工具改革，掀起高工效运动，解决劳动力不足的问题。到现在，全省推广使用的各种先进施工工具已有五十多万件，修筑运土轨道六千一百多公里，空中索道一万多公尺。这些工具在目前的施工当中，都发挥了很大威力，出现了很多高工效的红旗。
    在水利建设运动中，各级党的组织对于政治思想工作和群众生活，都特别重视。彰武、黑山等县在水利施工中，都建立了前后方密切配合的制度，前方需要什么，后方供应什么。黑山县各水利施工工地上的伙食，都做到了饭热、菜热、水热，使参加施工的民工，人人安心，个个满意。
    新华社广州7日电　广东省水利工地正在大搞施工技术革命，开展高工效运动，以解决当前水利建设中劳动力和器材设备不足的矛盾。
    广东省现在已经开工的两千多处水利工程，施工效率高低悬殊。有的进展快，有的进展慢。针对这种情况，省、专区和许多县的水利部门，这一个多月来已连续组织现场观摩，召开现场会议，全面推广先进地区、先进工地的高工效经验。
    在推广先进经验中，广东省首先抓住了土方工程中工作量最大的“挖、装、运、卸、压”这个环节，对工具和操作方法进行全面改革。较早开展水利技术革命运动的徐闻县，由于大规模改革了工具，去年11月底完成的总土方工程量已比前年同期增加了十一倍多。这个县正在施工的水利工程，最近的平均工效又比开工初期的平均工效提高了十多倍。汕头、湛江、佛山等专区一部分工地学习了先进工地的高工效施工经验以后，土石方工效也在迅速提高。
    各地在开展高工效运动中，积极设法解决器材设备不足的问题，湛江、佛山等专区许多水利工地为了解决这个问题，都采取了依靠群众自力更生的办法，大搞技术革新，自制土器材、土设备。不少地区都办起了炸药厂、硫磺厂、土硝厂、竹筋厂、铁工厂、木工厂、石灰厂以及水泥厂，实行工地工厂化。全省到最近为止建立的水泥厂已有三百七十多座，炸药厂九百六十多座，制成了一万多吨高标号、低标号的水泥和四千多吨炸药。许多地区组织了专业队伍，运用各种各样办法大量赶制器材设备，并且采用能够代用的原料。
    据新华社长沙6日电　湖南省常德县在水利施工中大搞工具改革，工效显著提高。全县十万民工从去年11月上旬到现在已完成一千二百七十多万土方任务，平均每人每天达到二十一点三方，比1957年冬修时最高工效提高六倍。
    常德县这个冬春的兴修水利土方任务共有三千三百多万方，全部水利工程完工后，水库面积就有十万亩，可以灌溉五十万亩农田，即使大旱也可以保证丰收。为了按期完成这个任务，全县各级党委充分发动和依靠群众，大搞工具改革，使工效不断提高。各公社和生产队都成立起技术革新小组，做到边做、边试，经过群众性的鉴定以后，就大量推广。各水利工地上到处都建立了木工厂和铁工厂。据统计，全县各工地光木工厂就有一百七十五个，各种工具都能自制自修，要什么有什么。到去年12月中旬止，全县已制造运土工具八万三千五百多件，夯压工具和挖土工具六千八百多件。民工们有信心要在1月下旬提前完成全县兴修水利的任务。
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　黑龙江省五常县十万水利建设大军大闹技术革命，基本上实现了土机械化，施工效率由过去平均每人每天一点七土方提高到四点五土方，在地冻三尺的不利条件下，创造出冬季水利建设快速施工的新局面。
    在北纬四十五度的冬季严寒里进行水利施工，困难重重。因此，这次水利施工一开始时，在基层干部和群众中间就有三种主张：一种是在工地扎营，昼夜苦战，企图单纯靠延长劳动时间来解决问题；再一种是全党全民总动员，停止其它工作，专搞水利建设；第三种是实干苦干巧干，发动群众大闹技术革命，减轻劳动强度，加速工程进度。
    中共五常县委把这三种主张交给干部和群众进行辩论，使大多数人都认识到单纯延长劳动时间，不能持久，全民动员势必影响农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，只有依靠群众进行技术革命才是上策。在全县干部和群众统一认识的基础上，中共五常县委书记和县长分别深入红旗运河和龙凤山水库等四个工程较为艰巨的工地，发动群众进行技术革命试点，并总结和推广了试点的经验。接着，一个声势浩大的技术革命运动就在全县各个水利工地上蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。各工地利用冻土成块而又坚脆的特点，采取了效率极高的综合爆破法；利用土法制造的冲击式劈土器，比人工取土的效率提高了十几倍乃至几十倍。
    新华社太原9日电　山西省五大盆地之一的忻定盆地，西起逯家庄东迄镇安寨连绵二十一个村庄的工地上，沸沸腾腾，大摆战场，一万七千多个农民正在这里挖一条五丈宽九尺深的百里“运河”，使盆地内的两条河流——云中河和牧马河拉起手来。与此同时，蓄水量达三千七百七十多万方的米家寨、鱼龙沟等六个水库、人造湖，也已经动工。一次即可蓄水两亿八千万方的界河铺大水库也在紧张地进行施工前的准备工作。据统计，除各公社自己负责兴修的一般工程外，由县直接指挥的七个重点工程即已有二万二千人投入战斗，并已完成了二十一万九千多土石方工程。
    按照拟定的规划，经过“一年突击、一年扫尾”到“苦战三年”的最末一年，整个盆地的水利工程就连成一个完整的系统，各处的水可以以余补缺自由调动，既能蓄，又能泄，二十年一遇的大雨成不了灾，一年无雨也保丰收。同时，盆地的土壤碱化也会大大受到限制，一部分盐碱下湿地也可以得到合理利用，将轻碱地排水变良田，重碱地加水种稻田。此外还可以利用水的落差大搞发电，利用湖库池塘养鱼种莲，渠道两旁可以植树，河流干渠可以行船。
    这一美好的远景，吸引着盆地广大人民，因此，当地方党委提出实现河网化的战斗号召后，各地的水利建设专业队伍，立即从四面八方涌向工地掀起热烈的劳动竞赛。在初级水利化时曾经打破“龙王头”、取出了“龙口水”的“活龙王”、“赛禹王”们，现在又在新的战役中大显神通。为了和严寒作斗争，各个公社的劳动大军还普遍采取了“集中兵力，各个突破”的施工方法，哪天在一段土地上揭开了冻盖，哪天就把这一段土地的工程全部结束。最近，河网化工程指挥部又在东风公社和火箭公社的工地上召开了两次现场会，一个更进一步的高工效运动正在这里掀起。（附图片）
