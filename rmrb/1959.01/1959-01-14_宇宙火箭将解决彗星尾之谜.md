Space Rockets Will Solve the Mystery of Comet Tails
Yang Ji-ke, Deputy Researcher, Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Chinese Academy of Sciences

According to a TASS report, space rockets are equipped with many measuring instruments for various scientific investigations. One of these is to study solar corpuscular radiation. What is solar corpuscular radiation? We know that the radiation coming from the sun, in addition to the sunlight that everyone sees every day and the invisible ultraviolet and infrared rays, also includes a kind of radiation that is generally not well known and cannot be detected. This radiation is composed of many positively charged protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei) and approximately the same number of negatively charged electrons, which are emitted at high speed and with great force. In recent years, there has been extensive scientific research on this corpuscular radiation emitted from the sun. It has been discovered that they are produced and radiated from the vicinity of a large sunspot group on the sun's surface. Sometimes, bright flares suddenly occur in the lower atmosphere of the sun, causing a surge of extremely large particle emissions. When they reach the upper atmosphere of the Earth and collide with molecules in the atmosphere, they produce beautiful and mesmerizing auroras, and cause violent magnetic storms on Earth (i.e., dramatic changes in the Earth's magnetic field). This magnetic storm causes extreme disturbances to the Earth's magnetic field. In the most severe case in 1940, long-distance shortwave radio communications around the world were interrupted for several hours, and radio facsimile completely failed. In some high-voltage power lines, magnetic storms generated additional currents of up to 60 amperes. Many power lines were severely obstructed, plunging many cities into darkness. By comparing the time of the solar flare with the start time of the Earth's magnetic storm, the particle ejection speed can be calculated to be more than 1,000 kilometers per second. During strong magnetic storms, scientists estimate that the density in the particle flow reaches as many as 100,000 per cubic centimeter.

With the measurements of various data on solar corpuscular radiation obtained by instruments carried in Soviet space rockets, people can obtain clearer and more reliable explanations for various phenomena caused by this radiation. Apart from phenomena on Earth such as auroras and magnetic storms, we might as well talk about one of the many cosmic mysteries that may be solved as a result - the mystery of comet tails, to get a glimpse of the possibilities.

Comets are commonly known as broom stars. Throughout history, their unusual comings and goings, and the long, beautiful tails that sweep across the sky have perplexed mankind for many years due to their mysterious nature. In our country, records of "comets appearing, long enough to span the sky" are numerous, and astrologers mistakenly believed that the appearance of comets portended war. In fact, all comets are members of the solar system, and their total number is far greater than generally imagined. According to astronomers' estimates, there are approximately 100 billion. They are scattered at distances of 50,000 to 100,000 astronomical units from the sun (the distance between the Earth and the sun is called one astronomical unit). Each comet orbits the sun, as one of its focuses, along an extremely elliptical orbit with a very large focal length (the distance between the two focuses of the ellipse). It often takes millions of years to complete one orbit. However, sometimes some comets are attracted by other celestial bodies passing nearby, as well as larger planets such as Jupiter or Saturn, so that their orbits move closer to the sun, and it only takes a few years or decades to orbit the sun once.

Most comets have a nucleus with a diameter of one to one hundred kilometers. Its main components are water, methane, and ammonia, with some other heavier elements interspersed. When comets are far from the sun, these compounds condense into solids and cluster together. But as it approaches the sun, these compounds are heated and evaporated, forming a gaseous envelope with a diameter of 10,000 to 100,000 kilometers. In most comets, this vapor also forms a tail, the longest of which is more than 100 million kilometers long! Strangely, when a comet orbits the sun at its closest point, its tail always points away from the sun, as if there is a mysterious force emanating from the sun that pushes this vapor outward.

What force pushes this vapor so far away? This has always been a mystery, and there have been several hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that photons in the light emitted from the sun create a repulsive force on the comet's tail. Comet tails can be broadly divided into three types. Type I tails are long and straight, Type II tails are shorter and curved, and Type III tails are even shorter. Absorption spectral analysis shows that Type I comet tails contain ionized molecules such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrocarbons. Furthermore, from photographic measurements of the acceleration of the material ejected from the comet tail, it can be calculated that the repulsive force they receive is approximately 200 to 2,000 times the sun's gravity. However, if we calculate the repulsive force caused by photons emitted from the sun, it is at most only a few times the sun's gravity. Therefore, at least for Type I comet tails, this photon repulsion hypothesis is problematic. Another hypothesis is that the ultraviolet radiation emitted from the sun causes a repulsive force on the comet's tail. However, after careful calculation, the repulsive force it produces is even less than that of visible light, and is even less sufficient to give Type I comet tails the large acceleration that has been measured.

The latest theory is that this repulsive force is caused by the impact friction of high-speed particles emitted from the sun as described above. Assuming that this hypothesis is valid, under what circumstances does a comet's tail form? Scientists have calculated that if a particle stream with a temperature as high as 10,000 degrees Kelvin is ejected from the sun, and a flow of 100 billion particles per square centimeter passes through it every second and collides with cations on the comet (charged atoms or molecules are called ions, and positively charged ones are called cations), it can cause them to accelerate by one meter per second every second, thereby forming the comet tail we observe. This hypothesis has already received some indirect proof, which is to prove whether the observed period of comet tail acceleration matches the period of the encounter between the comet and the particle stream emitted from sunspot groups (i.e., groups of black spots that sometimes appear on the sun's surface, mainly caused by storms) due to the sun's rotation. This proof is preliminary and awaits more observation to consolidate its truth. The Soviet space rockets will undoubtedly provide reliable direct measurement data, greatly contributing to the verification of the theory of comet tail formation. In the view of scientists studying astrophysics in the solar system, this is of great physical significance. And this is only one of many cosmic mysteries that can be explored through space rockets.

    宇宙火箭将解决彗星尾之谜
    中国科学院化工冶金研究所副研究员  杨纪珂
    根据塔斯社的报道在宇宙火箭中装有许多进行各项科学考察的测量仪器。其中有一项是研究太阳微粒辐射。什么是太阳微粒辐射呢？我们知道从太阳中出来的辐射
  除去大家天天见到的太阳光和不可见的紫外线和红内线外，
  还有一般所不大熟知的一种看不见的觉察不到的辐射，这种
  辐射是由许多带有正电荷的质子（即氢原子核）和大约等数
  的带有负电荷的电子所组成的微粒以高速度强有力地射出而
  造成的。近年来在科学上对于这种从太阳射出的微粒辐射有了很广泛的研究。并且发现它们是从太阳表面上的一个大型黑子群的附近产生而辐射出来的。有时在太阳上较低的大气层中会突然发生明亮的爆发。从而引起一阵极大的微粒喷射。当它们到达地球上层的大气和大气中的分子相撞击时就产生出美丽而迷惑的极光，并且使地球引起猛烈的磁暴（即地球磁场发生剧烈变化）。这种磁暴对于地球上的磁场引起了极大的扰动。在1940年最厉害的一次中，全世界的远距离短波无线电讯中断了好几小时，无线电传真完全失灵。在有些高压电力线上由于磁暴而额外产生了高达六十安培的电流。许多电力线都受到严重的障碍，从而使许多城市陷于黑暗之中。如果把太阳上爆发的时间和地球磁暴开始的时间核对起来，就可以算出微粒的喷射速度达每秒一千多公里。在强烈的磁暴发生时，科学家们估计在微粒流中的密度达每立方厘米十万个之多。
    随着苏联宇宙火箭中所载的仪器对于太阳微粒辐射的各种数据的测量所得，人们对于因这种辐射而引起的各种现象可以得到更明确和可靠的解释。除去极光和磁暴等地球上的现象以外，我们不妨来谈一谈可能因此而获得解决的许多宇宙之谜之一——彗星尾之谜，以见一斑。
    彗星俗称扫帚星。历来由于来去不寻常，而且拖着长长的美丽的尾巴横扫天空，它的神秘性已经多少年来迷惑了人类。在我国“彗星现，长可竟天”的记载更是史不绝书，星相家们误信彗星的出现主刀兵之灾。其实，所有的彗星都是太阳系中的成员，其总数之多，远超过一般所想像的。根据天文家的估计，约有一千亿个。它们散布在距离太阳五万到十万天文单位（地球和太阳间的距离称为一天文单位）处。每一彗星循着焦距（椭圆二焦点间的距离）极大的椭圆形轨道以太阳作为焦点之一绕行。绕行一圈往往需要几百万年。可是常常有些彗星受着近处越过的其它天体以及较大的行星如木星或土星的吸引，以致它的轨道移到更靠近太阳处而运动，绕日一周仅需几年或几十年。
    大多数的彗星有一个直径一至一百公里的核。它的主要成分是水、甲烷和氨，还有一些其它较重的元素交织其间。当彗星距太阳较远时，这些化合物都冷凝成固体而团聚在一起。但当它走近太阳时，这些化合物就受热蒸发，形成了一个直径一万至十万公里的气体包层。这种蒸气在多数彗星中还形成了一个尾巴，最长的竟达一亿公里以上！奇怪的是当彗星在近日处绕日运行时，它的尾巴老是朝着背向太阳的方向射出，似乎有一种从太阳中射出来的神秘的力量把这股蒸气向外冲了出去。
    是什么力量把这股蒸气冲出去那么远呢？这一直是一个谜，已有了几种假说。第一种假说是由于从太阳中射出的光线中的光子造成了对彗星尾的斥力。彗星尾可以大别为三种类型。1型的尾长而直，Ⅱ型的尾较短而弯曲，Ⅲ型的更短更弯。从吸收光谱分析知道在Ⅰ型彗尾中含有一氧化碳、二氧化碳、氮和碳化氢等阳离子化的分子。再从照片测量得彗尾中物质飞射的加速度来推算，它们所受的斥力约为太阳引力的二百至二千倍。可是，再回头算算，从太阳射出的光子所造成的斥力，至多不过是太阳引力的几倍而已。因此至少对Ⅰ型彗尾来说，这种光子斥力的假说是有问题的。另一种假说是由于从太阳中放出的紫外线辐射造成了对彗尾的斥力。可是经过仔细一算，它所产生的斥力连可见光还不如，更不足以使Ⅰ型彗尾达到所测量到的那么大的加速度。
    最新的一种说法认为这种斥力就是由于从上述的太阳中所射出的高速度微粒的冲击摩擦所造成的。假定这个假说成立，那末在什么情况下形成彗星的尾巴呢？科学家们计算出，如果从太阳喷射出温度高达绝对温度一万度的微粒流，每秒以每平方厘米通过一千亿个微粒的流量和彗星上的阳离子（带电的原子或分子叫离子，带正电的叫阳离子）相撞击，就可以使它们产生每秒钟增加每秒一米的加速度，从而形成了我们所观察到的彗星尾。这个假说已有了一些间接的证明，那就是通过观察彗尾加速的周期和由于太阳的自旋而使从黑子群（即太阳表面上有时出现的一群群黑点主要由风暴所引起）射出的微粒流遭遇到彗星的周期是否相符来证明。这种证明是初步的，还有待于更多的观测来巩固它的真实性。苏联的宇宙火箭无疑地将提供可靠的直接测量的数据，大大地有助于彗星尾形成学说的证明。在研究太阳系中天体物理的科学家们看来，这是有很大的物理意义的。而这不过是许多能够通过宇宙火箭来探索的宇宙间的奥秘之一而已。
