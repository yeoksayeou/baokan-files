Teachers and Students Combine to Learn Living Knowledge
East China Normal University's Geography Department Surveys the Yangtze River Delta

    (Our newspaper reports) Under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students of the Geography Department of East China Normal University combined teachers, students, and local experts, and integrated on-site teaching with classroom teaching during the comprehensive survey of the Yangtze River Delta.

    Nearly 400 teachers and students from the Geography Department, including second-year students and above, were entrusted by relevant units. Starting in October of last year, under the leadership of the Party's general branch of the department, they organized two large teams, one for physical geography and one for economic geography, to conduct a general survey of the Yangtze River Delta. On one hand, they investigated the changes and patterns of the Yangtze River's banks, mineral resources, crop distribution, climate change, and urban construction. On the other hand, they closely coordinated the survey and research content with the teaching of geography courses such as geomorphology, Quaternary geology, and economic geography, combining teaching, labor, and scientific research. It was the first time that the Geography Department of East China Normal University carried out such a large-scale field survey. The Party's general branch paid attention to giving full play to the role and academic expertise of teachers and helped them enrich their knowledge through practice. At the same time, it advocated that students carry forward the spirit of creative learning, emphasizing the combination of teachers and students, and the combination of local and foreign expertise, to do a good job in the general survey and on-site teaching.

    Before departure, teachers spent two weeks teaching students the basic knowledge of physical geography and economic geography to prepare for the general survey. In the field, as the general survey progressed, teaching activities were carried out at the work site. The content of on-site teaching was very rich, including methods of observation and investigation in the field, raising various observed geographical phenomena to the level of theory, and giving special lectures and special studies around solving important practical problems in production. When the large team was concentrated, teachers served as the main speakers for on-site teaching. When the middle team was concentrated, teachers and fourth-year students who had studied physical geography and economic geography gave lectures. When the small team was dispersed, students mainly carried out mutual teaching and mutual learning. Teachers lectured, and students also organized to participate in lesson preparation. This kind of on-site teaching combining teachers and students gave play to the enthusiasm of both teachers and students, making the content of teachers' lectures more in line with actual needs, and allowing students to often consider problems and actively study them.

    Teachers and students of the Geography Department lived and ate together in the field, jointly participated in investigation and research and teaching activities, jointly participated in drilling and field labor, and also studied politics and current affairs together, lived a democratic life together, and participated in recreational activities together. A new type of united and democratic teacher-student relationship was formed. Teachers and students could freely discuss academic issues, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and care for each other in thought and life.

    In the field survey and on-site teaching, teachers and students learned extremely rich local geographical information and practical knowledge from local experts that could not be found in books. Clarifying the evolution of the deep channel (mainstream of the river) and the development of hidden sandbars was one of the important tasks of this survey, which required analyzing the historical and latest riverbed topography maps. The teachers and students only had nautical charts measured 30 years ago, and there was too little data. Wang Ruyou, a 55-year-old fisherman from Tianshenggang, helped solve the problem. He gave a detailed and vivid report on the river channel conditions from Jiangyin to Tianshenggang and went to the ship where the middle team was working to guide the field investigation work, explaining on-site, not only explaining the historical changes and the current situation but also pointing out the causes and laws. He told the teachers and students that the sediments in the same depth of river channel inside and outside the hidden sandbar ridge on the western Jiangbian of Tianshenggang were different, one side was yellow mud, and the other side was sand, which was caused by the different influences of river flow and tides. After he explained his opinions on the distribution of substances on the riverbed, the students used instruments to measure, and the results completely matched. The teachers and students carefully studied the materials provided by this local expert and summarized the law of sediment deposition in the Yangtze River channel. When observing the rising and collapsing of the riverbank, the teachers and students generally compared the past and present topographic maps and looked at whether the riverbank terrain was flat or steep. When conducting a general survey in Yaogang this time, an old man in his seventies who had been engaged in reclamation and fishing there for a long time told them a very scientific local method: the riverbank that is rising has mud and sand near the water, a layer of cogongrass (a kind of wild grass) outside, and reeds on the outermost layer; the riverbank that is collapsing cannot see these layers. That is to say, observing whether the distribution of plant belts is obvious can identify the rising and collapsing of the riverbank. An old monk in Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang also described and analyzed the evolution of sandbars on the local river surface and drew a map. With the help of these local experts, the teachers and students explored the law of rising and collapsing of the Yangtze River bank.

    In this way, the teachers and students of the Geography Department completed the general survey of nearly 50,000 square kilometers of area in one and a half months, conducted 497 on-site teaching sessions in conjunction with the general survey, and wrote 1.7 million words of on-site teaching manuscripts. After returning to school, the teachers and students spent a month together writing a 3.37 million-word survey report. These tasks were originally planned to be completed in four years. After the field survey, the students personally experienced the close relationship between geographical science and national economic construction and loved their major even more. In the past, some students only read four reference books in four years, but now many students have read twenty or thirty books in these two months.

    The actual work in the field and the on-site teaching enabled the students and teachers of the Geography Department to learn a lot of production practice knowledge and improve their ability to apply and enrich theory in production practice. After the field work and business summary were completed, the Geography Department began to adopt the method of special lectures to conduct classroom education for students in courses such as physical geography and economic geography. This made the knowledge acquired by students more systematic, complete, and thorough. (Yu Huiyin)

    师生结合学习活的知识
    华东师范大学地理系普查长江三角洲
    本报讯　华东师范大学地理系师生在长江三角洲综合调查过程中，在党的领导下，做到教师、学生、土专家相结合，现场教学和课堂教学相结合。
    地理系教师和二年级以上学生近四百人接受有关单位的委托，去年10月起，就在系党总支的领导下组织了自然地理和经济地理两个大队，出发到长江三角洲从事普查工作，一面调查长江江岸的变化及其规律、矿产资源、农作物分布、气候变化、城市建设，一面密切配合调查研究内容，进行地貌学、第四纪地质、经济地理等有关地理课程的教学，将教学、劳动和科学研究结合起来。开展如此大规模的野外调查，在华东师大地理系还是第一次。党总支一面注意发挥教师的作用和学术专长，并帮助教师到实践中去充实自己的知识；一面提倡学生发扬创造性学习精神，强调师生结合、土洋结合，以搞好普查和现场教学。
  出发前，先由教师用两周时间向学生讲授了自然地理、经济地理的基本知识，为普查作好准备。到了野外，随着普查工作的进行，就在工作现场开展教学活动。现场教学的内容十分丰富，包括在野外进行观察和调查的方法，将观察到的各种地理现象提高到理论，以及围绕解决重要生产实际问题进行专题讲授和专题研究。在大队集中的时候，由教师担任现场教学的主讲。中队集中活动时，由教师和学习过自然地理、经济地理的四年级学生讲课。小队分散活动时，主要由学生开展互教互学。教师讲课，学生也组织起来参加备课。这种师生结合的现场教学，发挥了师生双方的积极性，使得教师的讲授内容更切合实际的需要，而学生也能经常考虑问题，主动钻研。
    地理系的教师和学生在野外同吃同住，共同参加调查研究和教学活动，共同参加钻探和田间劳动，还在一起学习政治、时事，一起过民主生活，一起参加文娱生活。形成了一种团结、民主的新型师生关系。师生之间对学术问题可以自由讨论，取长补短，在思想上、生活上也相互关怀。
    在野外调查和现场教学中，师生们从各地的土专家了解到极为丰富的乡土地理情况和书本上找不到的实践知识。摸清深泓（江水主流）演变和暗沙发育情况，是这次调查的重要任务之一，这就必须利用历年的和最新的江底地势图进行分析。师生们掌握的只是三十年前测定的航道图，资料太少。天生港的一位五十五岁的老渔民王如友帮助解决了问题。他就江阴到天生港一段江槽情况作了详细而生动的报告，还到中队工作的船上随船指导实地调查工作，现场讲解，不但讲出历史变迁和现况，还指出成因和规律。他告诉师生们，天生港西部江边暗沙脊内外的同样深度的江槽中，沉积的物质是不同的，一面是黄泥，一面是沙，这是由江流和潮汐的不同影响造成的。他讲解了自己对江底物质分布情况的意见后，学生们用仪器进行测量，结果完全吻合。师生们仔细研究了这位土专家提供的材料，总结出长江江槽沉积的规律。观察江岸涨塌情况，师生们一般用今昔地形图对比，以及看江岸地形是平的还是陡的。这次在姚港普查时，长期在那里围垦兼捕鱼的一个七十多岁的老人告诉他们一种很科学的土办法：正在涨的江岸，近水处是泥沙，外面一层是菅子草（一种野草），最外一层是芦苇；正在坍塌的江岸就看不出这些层次。这就是说，观察植物带的分布是否明显，可以识别江岸的涨塌。镇江金山寺的一位老和尚也叙述和分析了当地江面沙洲演变情况，还画出了图。在这些土专家的帮助下，师生们摸索出长江江岸涨塌的规律。
    就这样，地理系的师生们在一个半月的时间内完成了近五万平方公里地区的普查工作，结合普查进行了四百九十七次现场教学，写出了一百七十万字的现场教学讲稿。回校后，教师和学生在一个月的时间内，在一起写出了三百三十七万字的调查报告。这些工作原来打算用四年时间完成的，经过野外调查，学生们亲身体会到地理科学和国家经济建设的密切关系，更加热爱自己的专业了。过去有的学生四年才看四本参考书，现在许多学生在这两个多月中就看了二、三十本。
    野外的实际工作和现场教学使地理系的学生和教师都学到许多生产实践知识，提高了在生产实践中运用和丰富理论的能力。野外工作和业务总结结束后，地理系又开始采取专题讲座的方式，对学生进行自然地理、经济地理等课程的课堂教育。这就使得学生获得的知识更加系统、完整、深透。　（余辉音）
