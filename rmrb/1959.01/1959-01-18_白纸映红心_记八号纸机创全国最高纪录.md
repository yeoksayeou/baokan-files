White Paper Reflects Red Heart
    --Record of No. 8 Paper Machine Sets National Record
    Huang Tian
    A long, gigantic machine, like a ship that had dropped anchor, was huddled in the tall workshop. The usual roar had temporarily ceased, and workers scurried back and forth on and under the machine, with the clanging of hammers echoing. This was the major overhaul of the No. 8 Fourdrinier paper machine in the Second Workshop of the Jilin Paper Mill.
    With the workers' intense efforts, the entire overhaul was completed ahead of schedule. After a final safety check, the No. 8 Fourdrinier paper machine was put back into normal operation, no longer shaking and swaying like it did before the overhaul.
    After being restarted, the machine speed steadily increased, from the original 158 meters per minute to 180 meters per minute, and then to 190 meters per minute. Before long, the machine speed reached 200 meters per minute, setting the highest speed in the entire factory.
    However, this No. 8 machine was an old, non-automated Fourdrinier machine. With such a high speed, how could manually threading the copper wire and the paper from the third press keep up? As a result, empty runs occurred frequently. What to do? The workers were determined to find solutions and overcome the technical hurdle. Sun Laigui, the foreman of Shift B, first created a "copper wire breakage prevention controller," eliminating copper wire breakage. Then, the workers came up with a targeted solution, changing the counter-press to a straight press, so that the paper could automatically enter the dryer without manual threading. After breaking through these two major hurdles, the machine speed not only stabilized at 200 meters per minute, but even increased to 223 meters per minute, setting a new national record for the speed of similar paper machines.
    When the news of No. 8 machine's national record spread, cadres and workers alike beamed with joy. The overhauled No. 8 machine was running well, and with the two major hurdles overcome, the workers believed that if they replaced the large pulley, the machine speed could be increased by another 20 or 30 meters without any problems. However, Director Li of the Second Workshop hesitated. He thought: the end of the year is approaching, the national plan for next year (referring to 1959) has not yet been discussed, and due to the all-out Great Leap Forward, there is a power shortage. If we increase the machine speed now, wouldn't next year's production be even more difficult? So, he made up his mind: no matter how much the workers clamor, increasing the machine speed will have to wait until next year.
    The conference room was full of leading cadres from various workshops. The Party Secretary conveyed the resolution of the Municipal Party Committee to everyone. When talking about saving electricity, the Party Secretary said firmly: No matter how short the electricity supply is, No. 8 machine cannot be stopped. The paper produced by this machine is exclusively for the People's Daily, and we must never allow the Party newspaper to suffer... These words, like sharp chisels, pierced Director Li's heart. He suddenly realized that his idea of "holding back" was completely wrong. Thinking of this, he immediately ran back to the workshop.
    Just as Director Li announced the decision to increase the speed of No. 8 machine and never allow the Party newspaper to suffer, the workers almost unanimously said: "Yes, we will never let the Party newspaper suffer!" Everyone's enthusiasm was like wild horses released from their reins, and the large pulley was quickly installed.
    The machine started slowly. Young Liu Yupu, holding a ball of paper, leaped onto the walkway and carefully went to catch the paper on the copper wire. Once, twice, three times, because the machine speed was too fast, he failed to catch it more than ten times in a row. The machine was spinning idly at high speed, and everyone's hearts were anxiously pounding. Suddenly, a thunderous shout of "Got it!" broke out! In an instant, paper like a ten-thousand-foot-long bolt of silk flew nimbly through the long machine.
    Director Li held the tachometer firmly, and the pointer measuring the machine speed slid up quickly. "Comrades, we have succeeded! 253 meters," the national record was broken again. But on the eve of New Year's Day, they climbed to a new peak of 270 meters.

    白纸映红心
    ——记八号纸机创全国最高纪录
    黄天
    一台长长的身躯庞大的机器像一艘抛了锚的舰船一样，蜷伏在高大的车间里。平日的轰鸣声暂时停了下来，工人们在机上机下穿梭般地奔走，叮叮当当的敲击声阵阵传来。这是吉林造纸厂第二车间八号长网纸机在大检修。
    在工人们紧张的工作下，全部检修工作提前完成了，经过最后一次安全检查后，八号长网纸机重新投入了正常运转，再也不像检修前那样晃晃荡荡地扭秧歌了。
    重新运转后，车速在稳步上升，从原来的每分钟一百五十八公尺上升到一百八十公尺，接着又上升到一百九十公尺，没有多久，车速竟上升到二百公尺，创造了全厂最高车速。
    但是，这个八号机是一台老旧的非自动化的长网机，车速很快，用手来领铜网和三番压榨纸头怎能跟得上去？因此空运转现象不断发生。怎么办？工人们决心找窍门，冲破技术关。乙班工长孙来贵首先创造出“防止铜网断头控制器”，消灭了铜网断头；接着，工人们又想出了对症下药的办法，把反压榨改成正压榨，使纸头不用手领自动进入干燥。两大难关突破后，车速不但稳开二百公尺，而且竟提高到二百二十三公尺，首创同类纸机车速的全国最高纪录。
    八号机创全国最高纪录的消息传开后，干部和工人们个个笑逐颜开。检修后的八号机运转良好，两大难关突破了，工人们认为如果再换个大皮带轮，车速再提高二、三十公尺也没有问题。可是，二车间李主任却踌躇了，他想：眼看到年末了，明年（指1959年）国家计划还没讨论，而且由于全面大跃进，电力又感不足，如果现在就把车速提上去，明年的生产不是更难搞了么？于是，他打定主意：不管工人怎么吵，要提高车速明年再说。
    会议室里坐满了各车间的领导干部。党委书记向大家传达了市委会议的决议，谈到节约用电问题时，党委书记坚定地说：电力再缺，八号机不能停车，这台机器生产的纸张是专供人民日报用的，我们绝不能让党报受到损失……。这几句话像锋利的凿子一样楔进李主任的心，他霍然醒悟到自己“留一手”的想法太不对头。想到这儿，立即拔腿跑回车间。
    当李主任向大家刚刚宣布了提高八号机车速，绝不让党报受到损失的决定后，工人们几乎是同一声音地说：“对，绝不让党报受损失”。大家的劲头有如脱缰之马，大皮带轮也很快地安装起来了。
    机器缓缓地开动了，小伙子刘玉璞抱着纸团飞身一跃跳上走板，小心翼翼地去接铜网上的纸头。一次，两次，三次，由于车速太快，一连十多次也没接上，机器在飞速地打着空转，八九分钟过去了，大家的心都急得难熬。忽然，一声春雷般的喊声“接上啦”！一霎时，犹如万丈匹练般的纸张矫健地在长长的机器中飞舞奔驰而过。
    李主任牢牢地握着转数表，测验车速的指针刷地滑了上去，“同志们，胜利啦！二百五十三公尺”，全国最高纪录再一次被刷新。可是在元旦前夕，他们又跨上了二百七十公尺的高峰。
