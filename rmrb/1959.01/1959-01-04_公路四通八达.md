Highways Extend in All Directions

Qinghai Province has a very vast territory, and if you think that transportation in this province must be very inconvenient, then you are mistaken. Take the section of road from Lanzhou to Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, for example, dozens of buses run on it every day, and you can also travel by plane from the air; if you come to Qinghai after this spring, you will be able to ride on a comfortable train.

Before liberation, transportation in Qinghai was indeed very inconvenient. At that time, in the entire province of 820,000 square kilometers, there were only 472 kilometers of roads barely passable by vehicles, and the Qingxin and Qingkang (Xining to Yushu) highways leading to the pastoral areas were just two dotted lines on the map, completely impassable for cars. The main means of transportation at that time were yaks, donkeys, and large flatbed carts. It took seventy days just to travel to and from Yushu on horseback from Xining. In the few years since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, especially since the "Party and the people" started to vigorously develop transportation last year, the highway transportation industry in Qinghai Province has developed by leaps and bounds. In the past few years, the province has newly built a total of 11,575 kilometers of highways, more than 24 times the amount before liberation. Now, whether on the beautiful and vast grasslands, in the resource-rich Qaidam and Qilian Mountains, on the Tanggula Mountains at an altitude of more than 6,000 meters, or in the remote Henan Mongol Autonomous County, highways have been built, and cars can often be seen running on flat and wide roads. Among the six autonomous prefectures and thirty-seven counties and cities in the province, six autonomous prefectures and thirty-five counties and cities are now accessible by car, and the highway trunk network has basically taken shape.

The construction and opening of these highways is of great significance for promoting the economic and cultural development of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province. Means of production, cloth, general merchandise and other industrial products can be transported to agricultural and pastoral areas in a timely manner to meet the production and living needs of the broad masses; local specialties from agricultural and pastoral areas can also be transferred to all parts of the country through these highways to support cities, industries, and other construction projects. Before the completion of the Hua (Shixia) Ji (Mai) Highway, the transportation of materials into the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the transportation of wool and local products from there all relied on yaks. It took thirty-eight days to travel from Xining to Jimai. Now, it takes at most three days by car. Under the new situation of the entire Party and the people vigorously developing the steel industry, the province newly built thirty-five highways leading to mining areas last year, plus the original twenty-two highways leading to mining areas, totaling more than 2,700 kilometers. Many of these mining areas, where even traces of birds and animals were rarely seen in the past, have now established factories and are accessible by car. (Attached picture)

    公路四通八达
    青海省的幅员非常辽阔，如果你以为这个省的交通一定很不方便，那就猜错了。拿兰州到青海省会西宁这一段路来说罢，每天就有几十辆客车在奔驰着，并且可以坐飞机从空中行走；要是你今年春季以后来青海的话，能坐上舒适的火车。
    解放前的青海，交通的确十分不便。那时在全省八十二万平方公里的土地上，勉强能够通车的公路只有四百七十二公里，通往牧区的青新、青康（西宁至玉树）公路只不过是地图上的两条虚线而已，根本就无法行驶汽车。当时运输的主要工具就是牦牛、毛驴和大板车。从西宁骑马往返玉树一次，光在路上就得走七十天。解放几年来，由于各级党委的正确领导，特别是去年“全党全民”大办交通以来，青海省的公路运输事业有了飞跃的发展。全省几年来新建的公路共有一万一千五百七十五公里，比解放前增加二十四倍多。现在，不论在美丽辽阔的草原上，在矿藏丰富的柴达木和祁连山，在拔海六千多公尺高的唐古拉山上，在偏僻的河南蒙族自治县，都修有公路，经常可以看见汽车在平坦宽阔的公路上奔驰。全省六个自治州和三十七个县市中，已有六个自治州、三十五个县市可以通行汽车，公路干线网已经基本形成。
    这些公路的修建和通车，对于促进青海省各民族经济、文化事业的发展有着重要的意义。生产资料、布匹、百货等工业品可以及时运到农牧业区，满足广大群众的生产生活需要；农牧业区的土特产也可通过这些公路转运到全国各地，支援城市、工业和其他各项建设。花（石峡）吉（迈）公路未修通前，果洛藏族自治州运进物资和从那里运出羊毛、土特产，全部靠牦牛驮运。由西宁到吉迈路上要走三十八天。现在坐汽车最慢三天就可以到达。在全党全民大办钢铁的新形势下，全省去年又新建了三十五条通往矿区的公路，加上原来通往矿区的二十二条公路，共计长二千七百多公里。这些矿区中的不少地方，过去连鸟兽的踪迹都很少见到，现在却建立了工厂，通了汽车。（附图片）
