Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch. Albanian Ambassador to China, Balili, hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening in honor of the Albanian People's Republic Government Trade Delegation, headed by Vice Chairman Abdyl Këllezi, which is visiting China.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Xiannian were invited to attend the banquet.

    Ambassador Balili, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Abdyl Këllezi spoke successively at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, warmly congratulating the signing of the Sino-Albanian long-term trade agreement and loan agreement, congratulating the growing economic cooperation between China and Albania and the common rise of socialist construction, and congratulating the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation demonstrated by the Albanian government trade delegation during the talks, and for the great encouragement the delegation gave to Chinese workers and peasants during their visits to various parts of our country.

    Li Xiannian said: "China and Albania are close brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. In the common struggle to defend peace and build socialism, the people of the two countries have forged a close brotherly friendship and support and cooperate with each other in all aspects."

    Li Xiannian said: "Under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the government, the heroic Albanian people have achieved great victories on the glorious road of building socialism, and have made important contributions in defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism and opposing modern revisionism. Now, the Albanian people are confidently engaged in unremitting struggle to create an even better life for themselves. The Chinese people are infinitely pleased with every achievement made by the heroic Albanian people, just as if it were their own."

    In his speech, Vice Chairman Abdyl Këllezi said: Our visit to China is coming to an end. During our short stay, we have seen the new China. We have visited many factories, joint enterprises, people's communes, cultural institutions and places of interest, and learned about the lives of the working people. The enthusiasm and creativity of the people, as well as the unprecedented scale of construction, have left a deep impression on us. The Albanian people are pleased with the great achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people, and regard these achievements as their own.

    Abdyl Këllezi said: "The friendship between our two peoples is being strengthened in all aspects. Our views and positions on all issues are consistent, and these further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. All imperialists and their servants, the traitors to Marxism-Leninism—the Yugoslav revisionists—will forever suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the great power of our socialist camp and the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism."

    Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast before the end of the banquet, in which he proposed a toast to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the common victory of our communist cause.

    Also invited to the banquet were Xi Zhongxun, Secretary General of the State Council; Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade; Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister; Liu Mingfu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission; Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Luo Shigao, our Ambassador to Albania; Jiang Nanxiang, President of the China-Albania Friendship Association; and heads of relevant departments.

    愿中阿经济共同高涨
    巴利里大使为阿贸易代表团举行宴会
    周恩来总理和李先念副总理应邀出席
    新华社17日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使巴利里为以阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席为首的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府贸易代表团访问中国，今天晚间在北京饭店举行宴会。
    周恩来总理和李先念副总理应邀出席了宴会。
    巴利里大使，李先念副总理和阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席先后在充满友好气氛的宴会上讲话，热烈祝贺中阿两国长期贸易协定和贷款协定的签订，祝贺中阿两国经济合作的日益发展和社会主义建设事业的共同高涨，祝贺中阿两国人民的友谊万古长青。
    李先念副总理讲话时对阿尔巴尼亚政府贸易代表团在会谈期间体现的互助合作精神，以及代表团在我国各地进行参观访问时，给予我国工人农民的巨大鼓舞，表示衷心的感谢。
    李先念说：“中阿两国是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中亲密的兄弟。在保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同斗争中，两国人民结成了亲密的兄弟般的友谊，并且在各方面相互支援、相互合作。”
    李先念说：“英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的正确领导下，在建设社会主义的光辉道路上取得了巨大的胜利，在捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则和反对现代修正主义的斗争中，作出了重要的贡献。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在满怀信心地为创造自己的更加美好的生活而进行不懈的斗争。中国人民对于英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民所获得的每一个成就，都像自己的成就一样，感到无限高兴。”
    阿卜杜勒·凯列齐副主席在讲话中说：我们在中国的访问即将结束了。在短短的停留期间内，我们看到了新中国。我们参观了许多工厂、联合企业、人民公社、文化机构和名胜古迹，并且了解了劳动人民的生活。人们的热情和创造性以及空前巨大规模的建设给我们留下了深刻的印象。阿尔巴尼亚人民为兄弟的中国人民所取得的巨大成就感到高兴，并把这些成就看做是自己的成就。
    阿卜杜勒·凯列齐说：“我们两国人民间的友谊正日益在各方面加强，我们在一切问题上的看法和立场是一致的，而这些就更加加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。一切帝国主义者和他们的仆从，马克思列宁主义的叛徒——南斯拉夫修正主义者，在我们社会主义阵营的强大威力和马克思列宁主义不朽的思想面前将永远遭到可耻的失败。”
