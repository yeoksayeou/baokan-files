Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch from Washington: US President Eisenhower submitted a report to Congress on the implementation of the US foreign "aid" program on the 28th.

Eisenhower said in the report that in the 1958 fiscal year, which ended on June 30th last year, the amount of US foreign "aid" was 3.3 billion US dollars, of which 1.9 billion US dollars was military "aid" and 1.4 billion US dollars was economic "aid." The report acknowledged that since 1950, the US government has provided a total of more than 20.5 billion US dollars to drive its allies into an arms race, while its "allies" have had to spend 130 billion US dollars to expand their armaments and prepare for war. This means that for every dollar of military "aid" provided by the US government, the "aided" country has to spend five dollars. Eisenhower's report shows that in the 1958 fiscal year, the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet regime received the most US economic "aid" (221.1 million US dollars), followed by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime (184 million US dollars). In addition, these two puppet regimes also received "huge amounts" of military "aid."

Eisenhower once again yelled about the so-called "communist threat," especially maliciously slandering and vilifying the People's Republic of China, saying that China was "threatening the weaker free countries neighboring it," in an attempt to cover up the sinister purpose of its foreign "aid" program. But this clumsy trick was quickly exposed. Eisenhower had to admit that the "direct central goal" of the US foreign "aid" program was to set up military bases and deploy troops in the Far East, maintain the military alliances pieced together by the United States, and arm, train, and support the troops of its Asian "allies" at the disposal of the United States.

When talking about economic "aid," Eisenhower also talked a lot about the so-called "economic offensive" and "challenges" of socialist countries, attempting to cover up the US practice of economically infiltrating the "aided" countries with "aid" as a prelude.

    艾森豪威尔在国会泄露真情
    美国对外“援助”没安好心
    中心目标是要推行军事侵略政策
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔28日向国会提出关于美国对外“援助”计划执行情况的报告。
    艾森豪威尔在报告里说，在去年6月30日结束的1958财政年度，美国对外“援助”的数目是三十三亿美元，其中十九亿美元是军事“援助”，十四亿美元是经济“援助”。报告承认，自从1950年以来，美国政府为驱使它的盟国进行军备竞赛拿出了总共二百零五亿余美元，而它的“盟国”则不得不花掉一千三百亿美元去扩军备战。这就是说，美国政府提供一块美元的军事“援助”，受“援”国家就要拿出五块美元。艾森豪威尔的报告表明，在1958财政年度，接受美国经济“援助”最多的是南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政权（二亿二千一百万美元），其次是南越吴庭艳傀儡政权（一亿八千四百万美元）。此外，这两个傀儡政权还得到“数目庞大”的军事“援助”。
    艾森豪威尔再一次大叫所谓“共产主义威胁”，特别是恶意污蔑和中伤中华人民共和国，说什么中国在“威胁同它邻近的较弱小的自由国家”，企图这样来掩盖其对外“援助”计划的阴险目的。但是这种拙劣的伎俩很快就败露。艾森豪威尔不得不承认，美国对外“援助”计划的“直接中心目标”是在远东设置军事基地和部署军队，维系美国拼凑的军事同盟，武装、训练和支持供美国驱遣的它的亚洲“盟国”的部队。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到经济“援助”时也大谈所谓社会主义国家的“经济攻势”和“挑战”，企图以此来掩盖美国以“援助”为前导在经济上渗入受“援”国家的作法。
