According to the Sichuan Daily News, Dayi County has successfully extracted "Sodium Humate" from peat using indigenous methods.

Sodium Humate is a new type of fertilizer. It can enable crops to have deep roots, good seedlings, strong stems, and full grains. When used for wheat and rapeseed, it can increase yields by 30%-40%. They once used a sodium humate solution with a concentration of five parts per ten thousand to cultivate several wheat plants, and the roots grew five or six inches in four days.

Dayi County plans to produce 10,000 jin of sodium humate in the short term for topdressing for spring crops throughout the county.

    新型肥料胡敏酸钠
    据四川日报消息　大邑县用土法从泥炭中提取“胡敏酸钠”成功。
    胡敏酸钠是一种新型的肥料。它能使作物根子扎得深、苗稼好、茎秆硬、籽实饱满。用于小麦、油菜，可增加产量30％—40％。他们曾用十万分之五浓度的胡敏酸钠溶液，培植了几棵小麦，四天根子就长了五、六寸。
    大邑县计划在短期内生产一万斤胡敏酸钠，供全县小春作追肥之用。
