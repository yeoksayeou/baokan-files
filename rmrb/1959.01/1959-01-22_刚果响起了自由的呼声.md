    The Congo Hears the Call of Freedom

    To the Editors:

    I hope to express my sincere sympathy for the heroic people of the Belgian Congo through our newspaper. In recent days, I have been following the developments in the Belgian Congo with great concern. This is not because I have any special relationship with the Belgian Congo, but because as a Chinese people who have already been liberated, I cannot help but be extremely concerned about the fate of the African people who are struggling for their freedom. The dark African continent has long shown a glimmer of hope. More and more colonial people on this continent have broken the shackles on their heads and gained independence and freedom. And today, on the land of the Belgian Congo, which colonialists boast as an "oasis of stability," a rebellious roar has also been issued. This shows that the moment when the long night recedes from the entire African continent is not far away.

    The violence of the Belgian colonialists has failed to extinguish the burning anger. They even want to use cunning to soften the Congolese people's fighting spirit, making empty promises of "independence" in the distant future. However, the Congolese people, who have suffered enough deception, are not as easily fooled as the colonialists think. What they firmly demand is to forever smash the chains of enslavement, rather than adding some beautiful decorations to these chains. The Congolese people must persist in their struggle until they once again become the true masters of their land, and progressive people all over the world will inevitably stand by the Congolese people forever.

    刚果响起了自由的呼声编辑同志：
    我希望能通过我们的报纸表达我对英勇的比属刚果人民的真挚的同情。近些天来，我都怀着无比的关心注意比属刚果局势的发展。这并不是因为我同比属刚果有什么特别的关系，而是因为作为一个已经获得了解放的中国人民，我无法不对正在为自己的自由进行着艰苦斗争的非洲人民的命运极其关怀。黑暗的非洲大陆早就显露了希望的曙光，这个大陆上愈来愈多的殖民地的人民已经挣断了他们头上的枷锁，取得了独立和自由。而今天在这个被殖民主义者夸耀为“安定的绿洲”的比属刚果的土地上，也发出了叛逆的怒吼，这表明漫长的黑夜从整个非洲大陆上消退的时刻不会很远了。
    比利时殖民者的暴力并没有能扑灭已经燃烧起来的怒火，他们竟想用奸诈来软化刚果人民的斗志，空口允诺给予遥遥无期的“独立”。然而受够了欺骗的刚果人民并非殖民者所认为的那样容易愚弄的。他们坚决要求的是永远砸断那奴役的锁链，而不是在这锁链上加一些好看的纹饰。刚果人民一定坚持斗争下去，直到他们重新成为自己土地的真正主人，而全世界进步人类必然永远站在刚果人民的一边。
