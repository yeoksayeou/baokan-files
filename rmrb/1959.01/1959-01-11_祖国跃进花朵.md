Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Chemical Machinery Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building recently successfully trial-produced a ribbon-wound high-pressure vessel. After a burst test, it was proved that the design and manufacturing process of this high-pressure vessel have reached an advanced level.

High-pressure vessels with several hundred to one thousand several hundred atmospheric pressures must be used to produce industrial products such as chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic petroleum. Generally, there are two methods for manufacturing this type of container: one is the forging method, which is to forge a large steel ingot into the cylinder of the container; the other is to wrap it with multiple layers of steel plates. These two methods involve many processes, take a long time, and are technically more complicated. The ribbon-wound high-pressure vessel successfully trial-produced by the Chemical Machinery Research Institute has a working pressure of 320 atmospheres and a burst pressure of 1,250 atmospheres. It is made by winding steel strips around the outside of a circular steel cylinder and using special heating and cooling methods. The entire production process only uses a ribbon-winding machine tool and some simple auxiliary equipment, which saves half the steel compared to the general "forging method."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th: The Lushan area of Jiangxi Province recently conducted artificial rainfall experiments twice using local methods of burning chemical reagents on the ground, and both achieved results.

The experiments were conducted by an artificial precipitation experiment group jointly formed by the Central Meteorological Bureau and the Hydrological and Meteorological Bureau of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Resources and Electric Power on the afternoons of December 21st and 26th, respectively.

On the afternoon of the 21st, the weather in the Lushan area was clear, the ground temperature increased, and there was no wind. The artificial precipitation experiment group burned chemical reagents such as camphor alcohol solution in the air halfway up the mountain on Pulin Road in Lushan. Then, the cloud wisps in the sky gradually became clustered and pressed down, changing from blue to black. At 8:05 p.m., intermittent moderate rain began to fall in the Lushan area. By 5:00 a.m. on the 22nd, a total of 2.2 millimeters of rain had fallen in nine hours. Jiujiang, Poyang and other regions were also affected by chain reactions and successively experienced rainfall.

At 2:00 p.m. on the 26th, translucent altocumulus clouds appeared on the horizon in the Lushan area, and gradually invaded the sky. By 6:00 p.m., translucent altocumulus clouds and opaque altocumulus clouds coexisted, with a large amount of cloud cover. The artificial precipitation experiment group burned chemical reagents in the air on the hillside of Pulin Road in Lushan. Afterwards, the cloud layer in the sky changed from translucent altocumulus clouds to opaque altostratus clouds, and fog suddenly formed on the ground, followed by about ten minutes of light rain. By 9:30 p.m., the cloud layer continued to cluster and press down, and it began to snow. At 10:00 p.m., it rained and snowed, and stopped at 11:15 p.m., lasting four hours and fifty minutes.

The chemical reagents used in the artificial rainfall experiment in the Lushan area were inexpensive and could be purchased everywhere. The total cost of the two experiments was less than fifteen yuan. The method they used for the experiment was simple to equip, easy to operate, and easy to master.

Now, the staff of this artificial precipitation experiment group is conducting scientific summaries and verifications, and continues to conduct experiments on creating fog and dispelling clouds.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th: A new opera genre - Yi Opera - has appeared in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the rich reality of life has prompted the original song and dance forms of the Yi people to develop into dramas with characters and plots. By the end of last year, dramas such as "On the Steel Front," "The Hearts of Young People," and "Midnight Sheep Calling" had been staged successively, and the first amateur Yi Opera Troupe was officially formed. From then on, a new flower has been added to the great garden of art and literature of the motherland.

The form of Yi Opera inherits and develops the excellent traditions of Yi folk art. The language of Yi Opera is the language of Yi poetry, the music is Yi folk songs such as Shepherd's Tune and Passing-Mountain Tune, the instruments are Yi lusheng and flute, and the dances, postures, and stage steps are all drawn from the dances of their own ethnic group. At the same time, the thoughts and personalities of the characters in the play and the contradictions of the events are all developed in action, so that even viewers who do not understand the Yi language can clearly understand the content and main plot of the drama through dance movements and expressions.

The Yi people were originally a nation that could sing and dance, but before liberation, they never formed dramas with characters and plots, and there was a long-term separation of song and dance. After liberation, with the development of politics, economy, and culture, song and dance forms and small song and dance programs that combined singing and dancing gradually emerged.

    祖国跃进花朵
    绕带式高压容器试制成功
    新华社10日讯　第一机械工业部化工机械研究所最近试制成功绕带式高压容器。经过爆破试验，证明这台高压容器的设计和制造工艺方面都达到了先进水平。
    生产化肥、塑料和人造石油等工业产品，必须用几百到一千几百大气压力的高压容器。制造这种容器，一般都采用两种方法，一种是锻造法，即将很大的钢锭锻成容器的筒体；一种是用多层钢板包扎起来。这两种方法工序多、时间慢，技术也比较复杂。而化工机械研究所试制成功的绕带式高压容器，它的工作压力有三百二十大气压，爆破压力达一千二百五十大气压，是以钢带缠绕在圆形钢筒的外面并且用特殊加热和冷却方法制成的，全部生产过程只用了一台绕带机床以及一些简单的辅助设备，比一般“锻造法”节省一半钢材。庐山试验人工降雨成功
    新华社南昌10日电　江西庐山地区最近两次用地面燃烧化学试剂的土办法，进行人工降雨试验，都获得了成效。
    试验是由中央气象局和江西省水利电力厅水文气象局合作组成的人工降水试验小组在12月21日和26日下午分别进行的。
    21日这天下午，庐山地区天气晴朗，地面气温增高，无风。人工降水试验小组于庐山普林路半山腰对空燃烧了樟脑酒精溶液等化学试剂，接着天空云絮渐成团聚下压，并由蓝变黑。晚八时零五分，庐山地区开始降下间续性中雨，至22日晨五时，计九个小时，共降雨二点二公厘。九江、波阳等地区因受到连锁反应，也先后降雨。
    26日下午二时，庐山地区天边出现透光高积云，以后逐渐侵入天空，到晚六时透光高积云和蔽光高积云同时存在，云量较大。人工降水试验小组在庐山普林路半山坡上，对空燃烧了化学试剂，以后天空云层由透光高积云转为蔽光高层云，地面突然生雾，大约下降十分钟小雨。至晚九时三十分，云层继续团聚下压，并开始降米雪，晚十时降雨夹雪，到十一时十五分才停止，历时四小时五十分钟。
    庐山地区的人工降雨试验，所用的化学试剂价钱便宜，到处可以买到，他们两次试验用费一共不到十五元。他们进行试验的方法，设备简单，操作简便，容易掌握。
    现在这个人工降水试验小组的工作人员正进行科学总结和验证，继续进行造雾消云的试验。彝剧诞生
    新华社昆明10日电　一个新的剧种——彝剧，在云南省楚雄彝族自治州出现了。
    去年大跃进以来，丰富的现实生活，促使彝族原有的歌舞形式发展成为有人物，有情节的戏剧。到去年年底，先后演出了“在钢铁战线上”、“青年们的心”、“半夜羊叫”等剧目，并正式组成了第一个业余彝剧团。从此，在祖国的文艺大花园中，又增添了一朵新的鲜花。
    彝剧的形式，继承和发扬了彝族民间文艺的优秀传统。彝剧的语言是彝族诗歌的语言，音乐是彝族的放羊调和过山调等歌谣，乐器是彝族的芦笙和笛等，舞蹈、身段、台步也都是从本民族的舞蹈中吸取来的。同时，剧中人物的思想、性格和事件的矛盾都是在行动中展开的，即使不懂彝族语言的观众，也能通过舞蹈动作和表情，对戏剧内容和主要情节一目了然。
    彝族原是能歌善舞的民族，但在解放前，始终没有形成有人物，有情节的戏剧，而且长期存在着歌舞分离的情况。解放后，随着政治经济文化的发展，逐渐有了边歌边舞的歌舞形式和小型歌舞节目。
