Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 9th: The government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) stated in a memorandum today that it is prepared to do its utmost to help realize the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

The memorandum pointed out that, in the wish to safeguard the national interests of the German people and with deep concern for maintaining peace, the GDR government considers it necessary to draw attention to the dangerous consequences of the positions taken by the United States and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the West Berlin issue.

The memorandum was released at a press conference held this afternoon by GDR Deputy Foreign Minister Wenzel. The memorandum addressed the position clarified by the GDR in its reply to the Soviet government regarding the West Berlin issue.

The memorandum pointed out that the peaceful and democratic development of Germany is the starting point and content of all agreements signed by the Four Powers on the German question as a whole, or on the Berlin question. However, the Western countries have violated the agreements of the anti-Hitler alliance, thereby undermining the legal basis for their full rights to participate in the administration and occupation of Berlin. Since the obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement have been violated, maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin and the continued stationing of Western countries in West Berlin constitutes an act of interference in violation of international law.

The memorandum then pointed out that due to the policies pursued by the Western countries and the ruling groups in West Germany and West Berlin, an extremely abnormal situation has emerged in West Berlin. West Berlin has become an extremely dangerous source of tension in Europe. "Cold war" is being waged here against the German Democratic Republic and other countries of the socialist camp.

The memorandum stated that the GDR government agrees with the constructive proposal put forward by the Soviet government aimed at abolishing the occupation regime in West Berlin and opposing the use of West Berlin as a base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and is willing to promote the realization of this proposal by all possible means.

The memorandum concluded by emphasizing that the GDR government is convinced that any support from other countries' governments for the proposals of the GDR and the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue will be a contribution to easing international tensions and will help the cause of maintaining peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 9th: In a televised speech on the 8th, GDR Deputy Foreign Minister Wenzel emphatically pointed out that the primary goal of current German foreign policy must be to maintain and guarantee peace in Germany and Europe. He said that the basic line of the GDR government's policy lies in eliminating the sources of tension and getting rid of the roots of war. Its reply to the Soviet government's proposal of November 27, 1958, on the Berlin issue proves this point.

Wenzel continued: "The GDR government treats the Soviet government's proposal on abolishing the occupation regime and normalizing the status of West Berlin in accordance with the national interests of the German people. The whole of Berlin is an integral part of the territory of the German Democratic Republic. However, the GDR government agrees to the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, because such a solution will undoubtedly promote the easing of the situation in Germany and guarantee European peace. The GDR government is prepared to make such a great concession, once again demonstrating its willingness to reach agreements on all disputes in order to lead to a peaceful solution acceptable to all parties."

    民主德国政府发表备忘录
    全力促使西柏林变为自由城市
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国政府今天在一份备忘录中说，它准备尽力帮助实现关于把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    备忘录指出，德意志民主共和国政府本着维护德国人民民族利益的愿望和对维护和平的深切关怀，认为有必要提醒注意美国和德意志联邦共和国政府对西柏林问题的立场所引起的、包含着严重后果的危险。
    这份备忘录是今天下午在德意志民主共和国外交部副部长文策尔举行的记者招待会上发表的。备忘录谈到了德意志民主共和国就西柏林问题给苏联政府的复照中所阐明的立场。
    备忘录指出，实现德国的和平民主的发展，这是四大国无论在整个德国问题上、或是柏林问题上签订的各项协定的出发点和内容。但是，西方国家破坏了反希特勒同盟的协议，从而自己破坏了自己参加管理和占领柏林的全部权利的法律基础。波茨坦协定规定的义务既然遭到破坏，在西柏林保持占领制度和西方国家继续驻扎在西柏林，这是违反国际法的干涉行为。
    备忘录接着指出，由于西方国家和西德及西柏林统治集团执行的政策，西柏林出现了极不正常的局面。西柏林变成欧洲紧张局势的极危险策源地。在这里对德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家进行“冷战”。
    备忘录说，德意志民主共和国政府同意苏联政府提出的目的在于取消西柏林占领制度和反对利用西柏林作为北大西洋公约组织的基地的建设性建议，并且愿意用一切可能的办法促使这一建议的实现。
    备忘录最后强调说：德意志民主共和国政府确信，其他国家政府对德意志民主共和国和苏联关于柏林问题的建议的任何支持，都将是对缓和国际紧张局势的贡献，并将有助于维护和平的事业。
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国外交部副部长文策尔8日在发表电视演说时着重指出，当前德国外交政策的首要的目的必须是维护和保证德国和欧洲的和平。他说，德意志民主共和国政府政策的基本路线在于消除紧张局势的策源地和摆脱战争的根源。它对苏联政府1958年11月27日关于柏林问题的建议的复照就证明了这一点。
    文策尔继续说：“德意志民主共和国政府是根据德国人民的民族利益来对待苏联政府关于废止占领制度和使西柏林地位正常化的建议的。整个柏林都是德意志民主共和国领土的组成部分。但是德意志民主共和国政府同意把西柏林变为非军事化的自由城市的建议，因为这种解决无疑将会促进德国局势的缓和和保证欧洲和平。德意志民主共和国政府准备做这么大的让步，再一次表明它愿意就一切争端达成协议，以导致各方面都能接受的和平解决。”
