Talking About Learning to Skate
National Figure Skating Referee Shen Zuxiu

Skating is one of the most interesting and beneficial winter sports. In the fresh, cold air, on the smooth, mirror-like ice, when you skate at a fast speed, perform agile figure skating movements, or play ice hockey with a stick, you will feel happy, comfortable, and forget the severe cold. Since liberation, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, skating has become one of the main winter sports activities loved by the masses in Northeast, North, and Northwest China. Skating is not only interesting and attractive, but also very beneficial to the body. Regular skating can increase breathing volume, promote metabolism, normalize the activity of internal organs, and develop excellent qualities of perseverance, cold resistance, resourcefulness, and courage.

Learning to skate is not a difficult thing; it is not difficult to learn to turn and stop after you can skate. Beginners can quickly learn to skate as long as they master the following key points.

Suitable Skates are Important

If the skates are not suitable, it will directly affect the improvement of skating performance. If the shoes are too tight, wearing them will impede blood circulation, easily cause frostbite and ankle pain. If the shoes are too big, the feet will swing from side to side inside the skates, making it difficult to exert force, and the ankles are prone to injury. Suitable skates make the feet and skates one body, so that the feet feel very sensitive on the ice through the skates and blades. Whether skating with the outer or inner edge, turning or stopping, you can fully exert your strength, and will not lose part of your strength due to skates that are too large or too small. The inner and outer edges of the blade should always be kept sharp. If the blade is smooth and round, it should be ground with an electric grinder or an oilstone. Electric grinding produces horizontal lines, which can be rough at first, so lightly grind with an oilstone again.

First Time on the Ice

Before getting on the ice, beginners can first try walking on a wooden board, because the ice blade is very narrow and the sole of the shoe cannot be bent, to get a feel for its characteristics. After being able to maintain body balance, slowly get on the ice to reduce falls. When standing on the ice, the upper body should lean forward slightly, the arms should be naturally placed on both sides of the body, the knees should be slightly bent, and the feet should be separated by about the same width as the shoulders, with the toes pointing outward in a V shape. When starting to skate, use the inner edge of the right foot to push off the ice, and the left foot slides forward diagonally; the steps should not be too long. After the right foot pushes off the ice, immediately lift it up and slide forward parallel to the left foot. After the sliding force disappears, use the left foot to push off the ice and the right foot slides. After the left foot pushes off the ice, immediately lift it up and slide forward parallel to the right foot. In this way, the two feet alternate sliding, and the footprints form a herringbone shape. After becoming proficient, gradually change the parallel forward movement of the two feet into an alternating pushing and sliding motion, and further lengthen the single-foot sliding distance.

Turning and Stopping

After learning to skate forward, you should continue to learn to turn and stop, so that you can skate freely forward, backward, left, and right on the ice, and avoid collisions with others when there are many people, and lay the foundation for learning speed, figure skating, or ice hockey in the future.

There are many ways to turn, and here are two.

Turning with both feet sliding simultaneously: Skating on a curved track generally involves turning counterclockwise. When learning, it is best to start by learning to turn to the left. Initially, after gaining a certain speed while skating forward, use inertia to move both feet forward in parallel. If you want to turn to the left, the left foot is slightly forward using the rear half of the outer edge, and the right foot is slightly backward using the rear half of the inner edge of the blade on the ice, face to the left, the left arm extends to the side and rear, the right arm extends forward, the upper body leans slightly to the left and rear, the knees are slightly bent, and the center of gravity is shifted to the left leg, then the trace left by the skating will be an arc turning to the left. The movements are reversed when turning to the right.

Step-over turn: First take a few steps forward, when you want to turn to the left, the left foot uses the outer edge to press the ice, the center of gravity is on the left foot, the right foot pushes off the ice and is raised from behind to the front of the left foot, using the inner edge to make contact with the ice, the center of gravity is shifted to the right foot, and then the left foot uses the outer edge to push out to the right side, face to the left and front, the body leans slightly to the left, and the arms swing naturally. When starting to practice, the steps should be shorter, and the steps should be lengthened after you are proficient.

There are also many ways to stop, and here are two.

Stopping with the inner edges of both feet: At the beginning, bend both legs, bring the knees together, lean the upper body forward, squat the buttocks down, extend both arms forward, the two blades face each other at an angle of about 60°, press the ice with the inner edges of the two blades, and you can stop. When learning, you must practice at a slower speed.

Stopping by turning with both feet: In the sliding, if you want to turn to the left to stop, shift the center of gravity to the left foot, extend both arms forward, bend both knees, the left foot uses the outer edge, the right foot uses the inner edge, and simultaneously press the ice hard to the side and front, and you can stop. If the speed is too fast and it does not stop immediately, you can sharply turn and press the ice to the right again to stop completely.

    谈初学滑冰
    花样滑冰国家裁判　沈祖修
    滑冰是一项冬季最有趣而有益的运动。在清新寒冷的空气中，平光如镜的冰面上，当你以飞快的速度滑跑，敏捷的动作滑花样，或拿着冰杆打冰球，就会感到心情愉快、身体舒畅，并忘掉了天气的严寒。解放以来在党和政府的领导关怀下，滑冰在我国东北，华北，西北地区已成为广大群众所爱好的冬季主要体育活动项目之一。滑冰不但有趣能吸引人，而且对身体也很有益处。经常滑冰的人能增加呼吸量，促进新陈代谢，使内脏各部器官活动正常，并可锻炼出坚毅，抗寒，机智，勇敢的优良品质。
    学习滑冰不是一件很困难的事，能滑行再学转弯停止也不难。初学者只要掌握以下几项要领就能很快地学会滑冰了。
    冰鞋要合适
    冰鞋如果不合适，直接影响滑冰成绩的提高，鞋太紧，穿着血液不流通易冻脚及脚腕酸疼，鞋太大，脚在冰鞋内两边摆动不好用力，而且脚腕容易受伤，合适的冰鞋使脚同冰鞋成为一个整体，使脚部通过冰鞋冰刀在冰上感觉很灵敏，无论用外刃或内刃滑冰，转弯或停止均能充分发挥力量，不致因冰鞋过大或过小而消失了一部分力量。冰刀的内刃与外刃应经常保持锐利，如果刀刃滑圆了就应电磨或油石磨，电磨有横纹，初滑易涩，再用油石稍磨一下。
    初次上冰
    初学的人在上冰以前可先在木板上行走试一试，因为冰刀很窄鞋底不能弯曲，体会一下它的特性，能够维持身体平衡后再慢慢地上冰，可以少摔跤。站在冰上时，上体要稍向前倾，两臂自然的放在身体两侧，两膝微曲，两脚分开约和肩同宽，脚尖向外成八字形。起滑时，用右脚内刃蹬冰，左脚向斜前方滑出；步伐不可过长，右脚蹬冰后立即抬起和左脚平行向前滑行，等滑行力量消失后再用左脚蹬冰右脚滑行，左脚蹬冰后立即抬起与右脚平行向前滑行，这样两脚交换滑行，足迹成人字形，动作熟练以后使两脚平行前进动作渐渐改为两脚轮流蹬一下滑一下的动作，再进一步使单脚滑行距离加长。
    转弯和停止
    学会前进滑行后应该继续学习转弯和停止，这样才能在冰上前后左右滑行自如，人多时也不致互相冲撞发生危险，而且为将来学习速度、花样或冰球打下基础。
    转弯的方法很多，现在介绍两种。
    双脚同时滑行转弯：在冰场弯道上滑行一般都是向逆时针方向转弯，初学时最好也先学向左边转弯，开始时当前进滑行有了一定的速度之后，利用惯性两脚同时并进，如欲向左转弯，左脚略向前用外刃的后半部，右脚稍向后用内刃的后半部着冰，面向左看，左臂向侧后方伸出，右臂向前伸，上体稍向左后方倾斜，两膝微曲，身体重心移在左腿上，则所滑出的痕迹即成向左的弧线。向右转弯时动作相反。
    压步转弯：开始时先向前滑行几步，要向左转弯时，左脚用外刃压冰，重心放在左脚上，右脚蹬冰后由后方提到左脚的前面，用内刃着冰，重心移在右脚上，然后左脚用外刃向右侧方蹬出，面向左前方，身体稍向左倾斜，两臂自然摆动。开始练习时，步幅要短一些，等到熟练后步幅再加长。
    停止方法也很多，现在也介绍两种。
    两脚内刃停止：开始时两腿弯曲，膝部靠拢，上体前倾，臀部向下蹲，两臂前伸，两刀相对约成60°角，用两刀内刃压冰，即可停止，初学时，必须在速度较慢情况下练习。
    两脚转弯停止：在滑行中如欲向左转弯停止时，重心移在左脚上，两臂前伸，两膝微曲，左脚用外刃，右脚用内刃同时用力向侧前方压冰，即可停止，如速度太快没有立即停止，可再急向右转压冰一次，就能完全停止了。
