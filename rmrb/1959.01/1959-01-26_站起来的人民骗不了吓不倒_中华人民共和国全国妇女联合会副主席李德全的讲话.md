Dear friends and comrades!

    Today, the flames of anti-colonialism are burning in Cuba in Latin America and the Congo on the African continent. The people of Cuba and the Congo are engaged in a heroic struggle for national independence, freedom, and democracy. We Chinese women extend warm greetings to the fighting brothers and sisters of Cuba and the Congo. We firmly support their just struggle. We strongly condemn and protest against the US imperialist interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonial authorities' barbaric suppression and massacre of the Congolese people.
    For many years, US imperialism, through its loyal lackey Batista, controlled Cuba's politics like a poisonous snake, carried out brutal economic plunder, and slaughtered large numbers of Cuban people. Cuba, the sweetest country in the world, saw its people living the bitterest lives. Under Belgian colonial rule, the population of the Congo decreased from 30 million to 13 million in eighty years, with an infant mortality rate as high as 50%. However, despite the extreme ferocity of imperialism, the Cuban people, after a long period of struggle, especially the armed struggle of the past two years, finally cut off the claws of US imperialism and overthrew the traitor Batista's dictatorial rule. The Congolese people, holding high the torch of freedom, are waging a heroic struggle against the Belgian colonial rulers.
    But imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat. US imperialism has recently blatantly interfered in Cuba's internal affairs, attempting to deprive the Cuban government of its right to sanction counter-revolutionary war criminals and conspiring to subvert the new government in order to restore reactionary forces in Cuba. Belgian colonialists carried out a horrific massacre of the Congolese people, shrouding the entire Leopoldville in terror. At the same time, they vainly attempted to deceive the Congolese people with empty lies of "independence" in order to buy time to intensify the brutal suppression of the Congolese people.
    This shameless interference and bloody crime of imperialism and colonialism has aroused the infinite anger of the Cuban and Congolese people. The million-strong demonstration held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on January 21 was a powerful response to US imperialism, and the Congolese people responded to the Belgian colonialists' massacre and conspiracy with the roar of "Belgians get back to Europe!" and "Long live Congolese independence!"
    The people who have stood up can never be intimidated by bayonets, guns, and machine guns, nor can they be deceived by conspiracies and tricks. The roar of Latin America and the African continent against colonialism has resounded throughout the world, and their just struggle has received the sympathy and support of the people of the world.
    We Chinese people and Chinese women have personally experienced the same fate as the Cuban and Congolese people and suffered the cruel oppression of imperialism. We only achieved victory after waging a resolute struggle against the imperialists. Therefore, we have deep sympathy and concern for the Cuban and Congolese people's struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. We firmly oppose the shameless interference of US imperialism in Cuba's internal affairs, and we resolutely oppose the bloody suppression of the Congolese people by the Belgian colonialists. We resolutely give full support to the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people!
    Now is no longer the era in which imperialism can arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the people in colonies and semi-colonies! The struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence, freedom, and democracy is growing stronger day by day. The tide of history is irresistible, and the righteous people will surely win the final victory. We shout:

    Imperialists, get out of Latin America!
    Belgian colonialists, get out of Congo!
    Long live the victory of the national liberation movement!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

    站起来的人民骗不了吓不倒
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席李德全的讲话亲爱的朋友们，同志们！
    今天在拉丁美洲的古巴和非洲大陆的刚果正在燃烧着反殖民主义的烽火，古巴和刚果人民为争取民族独立、自由和民主正进行着英勇的斗争。我们中国妇女向斗争中的古巴和刚果的兄弟姊妹们致以热烈的敬意。我们坚决地支持他们的正义斗争。我们对于美帝国主义干涉古巴的内政，比利时殖民当局野蛮镇压和屠杀刚果人民，提出严厉的谴责和抗议。
    多少年来，美帝国主义通过它的忠实的走狗巴蒂斯塔像毒蛇般地控制着古巴的政治，实行残酷的经济掠夺，并且杀戮了大批古巴人民。古巴，这个世界上最甜的国家，而人民却过着最苦的生活。刚果人民在比利时殖民统治下，八十年来人口从三千万减少到一千三百万，婴儿死亡率竟达50％。但是尽管帝国主义穷凶极恶，古巴人民经过长期的斗争，特别是近两年来的武装战斗，终于斩断了美帝国主义的魔爪推翻了卖国贼巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治。刚果人民高举着自由的火炬，进行着反对比利时殖民统治者的英勇斗争。
    但是帝国主义不甘心他们的失败，美帝国主义最近竟明目张胆地干涉古巴的内政，企图剥夺古巴政府制裁反革命战犯的权利，阴谋颠复新政府，使反动势力在古巴复辟。比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民进行了骇人听闻的大屠杀，使整个利奥波德维尔笼罩在恐怖中。同时他们又妄想用空洞的“独立”谎言来欺骗刚果人民，以便争取时间对刚果人民加紧残暴镇压。
    帝国主义和殖民主义的这种无耻的干涉和血腥罪行，引起了古巴和刚果人民的无比愤怒。1月21日在古巴首都哈瓦那举行的一百万人的大示威是对美帝国主义的一个有力的回答，刚果人民则以“比利时人滚回欧洲去！”“刚果独立万岁！”的怒吼来回击比利时殖民者的屠杀和阴谋。
    已经站起来了的人民绝不是刺刀、枪杆和机关枪所能吓倒的，也不是阴谋诡计所能欺骗得了的，拉丁美洲和非洲大陆反对殖民主义的怒吼响彻了全世界，他们的正义斗争得到了全世界人民的同情和支持。
    我们中国人民和中国妇女亲身经历过与古巴和刚果人民同样的命运，遭受过帝国主义的残酷压迫。我们就是在同帝国主义者进行了坚决的斗争之后才取得胜利的。因此我们对古巴、刚果人民争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争寄予深切的同情和关怀。我们坚决反对美帝国主义对古巴内政的无耻干涉，坚决反对比利时殖民主义者对刚果人民的血腥镇压，我们对于古巴、刚果人民的正义斗争坚决给予全力的支持！
    现在已经不是帝国主义任意摆布殖民地半殖民地人民的命运的时代了！亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立、自由和民主的斗争正一天一天强大，历史的潮流是不可抗拒的，正义的人民必将获得最后的胜利。我们高呼：
    帝国主义者从拉丁美洲滚出去！
    比利时殖民主义者从刚果滚出去！
    民族解放运动胜利万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
