Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. To further strengthen the friendship and unity between coal miners and trade union organizations of China and Japan, the National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union invited a delegation of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union to visit China. During the visit, both sides held friendly talks on the issue of the revision of the "Security Treaty" by the Japanese and American reactionaries, the issue of the U.S. war provocateurs' military intervention in the Taiwan area, and the issue of friendly unity between coal miners and trade unions of China and Japan, reached unanimous agreement, and signed and issued a joint statement in Beijing on the afternoon of January 2nd. Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the signing ceremony of the joint statement. Li Chunming, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, and Kazuma Noguchi, head of the visiting delegation of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union, signed the joint statement.

The joint statement pointed out that Japanese coal miners and the Japanese people have waged resolute struggles against the conspiracy of the Japanese and American reactionaries to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the series of anti-democratic policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government, and have achieved great victories. The visiting delegation of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union demanded that the Japanese government abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," refuse the use of military bases in Japan proper and Okinawa by the U.S. military, immediately stop its hostile policy towards China, and called on Japanese coal miners and the Japanese people to launch a broad movement and struggle together to force the Japanese government to comprehensively change its policies and promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union fully supports the struggle of Japanese coal miners and the Japanese people for national independence, democratic freedom, and Japan-China friendship, as well as the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and firmly believes that the struggle of Japanese coal miners and the Japanese people will overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous development and victory.

The joint statement went on to say that the visiting delegation of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union and the Japanese coal miners fully support the Chinese people's struggle against the war provocations of U.S. imperialism and the Chinese people's firm determination to liberate Taiwan, and express their serious protest against the aggressive military actions of U.S. war provocateurs and their conspiracy to create "two Chinas," demanding that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area. The National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union welcomes these propositions of the Japanese Coal Miners' Union and sincerely thanks the Japanese coal miners for their support for the just struggle of the Chinese coal miners and the Chinese people.

The joint statement said that both sides unanimously believe that: the U.S. imperialism's pursuit of a war policy, the cultivation of militarist forces and the revival of militarism in Japan, and the creation of tension in the Taiwan Straits area, are a serious threat to Asian peace and an infringement on the independence and sovereignty of Asian and African nations. The demand that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area, withdraw from Okinawa and the Japanese mainland, and withdraw from all Asian and African regions, and the resolute opposition to U.S. imperialism's manufacture of nuclear weapons war, is the common aspiration of coal miners and people of Asian and African countries.

The joint statement stated that the Chinese and Japanese coal miners will continue to strengthen unity and mutual support, fight against war and defend peace; continue to develop friendly exchanges between coal miners and trade unions of the two countries, and work together to eliminate artificial obstacles to the normalization of relations between China and Japan, and contribute to the great aspiration of permanent peace for mankind.

    新华社2日讯　为了进一步加强中日两国煤矿工人与工会组织的友谊和团结，中国煤矿工会全国委员会邀请了日本煤矿工会访华代表团到我国访问。在访问期间，双方就日美反动派修改“安全条约”问题、美国战争挑衅者在台湾地区的军事干涉问题及中日两国煤矿工人与工会之间友好团结的问题，举行了友好会谈，取得了一致意见，并于1月2日下午在北京签署发表了联合声明。中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜参加了联合声明的签字仪式。中国煤矿工会全国委员会副主席李春明和日本煤矿工会访华代表团团长野口一马分别在联合声明上签了字。
    联合声明指出，日本煤矿工人和日本人民对日美反动派修改日美
  “安全条约”的阴谋及岸信介政府的一系列反民主的政策进行了坚决的斗争，并取得了巨大的胜利。日本煤矿工会访华代表团要求日本政府废除日美“安全条约”，拒绝美军利用日本本土和冲绳的军事基地，立即停止敌视中国的政策，并号召日本煤矿工人和日本人民一道展开广泛的运动和斗争，迫使日本政府全面地改变政策，促进中日两国邦交正常化。中国煤矿工会全国委员会完全支持日本煤矿工人和人民要求民族独立、民主自由和日中友好以及两国邦交正常化的斗争，并深信日本煤矿工人和人民的斗争将克服各种困难获得不断的发展和胜利。
    联合声明接着说，日本煤矿工会访华代表团和日本煤矿工人完全支持中国人民反对美帝国主义者的战争挑衅和中国人民坚决解放台湾的斗争，并对美国战争挑衅者的侵略性军事行动和制造“两个中国”的阴谋表示严重的抗议，要求美军立即从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤退。中国煤矿工会全国委员会对日本煤矿工会的这些主张表示欢迎，并衷心感谢日本煤矿工人给予中国煤矿工人和中国人民的正义斗争的支持。
    联合声明说，双方一致认为：美帝国主义推行战争政策，在日本培植军国主义势力，复活军国主义，在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，是对于亚洲和平的严重威胁，也是对亚非各民族独立和主权的侵犯。要求美军立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区，撤出冲绳和日本本土，撤出一切亚非地区，坚决反对美帝国主义制造核武器战争，这是亚非各国煤矿工人和人民的共同愿望。
    联合声明表示，中日两国煤矿工会将继续加强团结和相互支援，为反对战争，保卫和平而斗争；继续发展两国煤矿工人和工会之间的友好来往，为排除中日两国关系正常化的人为障碍而共同努力，为人类永久和平的伟大愿望作出贡献。
