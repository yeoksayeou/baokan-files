Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: Our correspondent reports: In the past year, economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries and many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has seen new developments. Over the past year, in addition to continuing to strengthen and expand economic cooperation with countries that already had economic ties, such as India, Indonesia, and the United Arab Republic, these socialist countries have also established new economic ties with a series of other nations.

Last October, the Soviet Union provided Argentina with a large amount of oil machinery and equipment in the form of a loan of 400 million rubles. This agreement has significant implications for Argentina's oil industry and the development of the entire national economy and has been warmly welcomed by Argentine public opinion. The Argentine "Times" once pointed out that this agreement was "the most favorable agreement that Argentina has ever signed."

After a long period of stagnation, the Soviet Union and Brazil resumed trade relations last year. According to an agreement concluded between the two countries last October, the Soviet Union will exchange 60,000 tons of crude oil for 20,000 bags of cocoa from Brazil. This beginning has greatly interested the Brazilian public, and the calls among them for restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and expanding the scope of trade are growing louder. In addition, Poland and Brazil also signed a trade agreement last year, with Poland supplying Brazil with coal, steel rails, and machinery and equipment, and promising to build fourteen ships for Brazil within three years.

The news that the Soviet Union promised to provide a loan of 400 million rubles to the United Arab Republic to help build the Aswan Dam last year cheered the entire Arab world, because building a high dam to control the Nile River and put it to work for production has been the hope of the Egyptian people for many years. The United States and Britain had attempted to use aid in the construction of this dam to carry out shameless political blackmail. Now, the Soviet Union and the UAR have signed an executive resolution on the Soviet Union's provision of economic and technical assistance for the first phase of the Aswan Dam project, and a group of Soviet experts led by Nikitin, Deputy Chairman of the State Foreign Economic Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, has conducted on-site research in Aswan to prepare for the dam project.

The Soviet Union and almost all Eastern European socialist countries have established economic cooperative relations with the Republic of Iraq, which was established in July last year. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and others supplied Iraq with complete sets of industrial equipment, various machines, or steel, telecommunications equipment, precision instruments, and chemical industrial products to help it establish an independent national industry. Last year, the trade agreement signed between the German Democratic Republic and Guinea was the first foreign trade agreement of this newly independent country.

Last year, when the Indonesian government and people were waging a resolute struggle against the rebel groups supported by imperialism, and the domestic economy was suffering certain difficulties, the Soviet Union provided it with a loan of US$100 million. This loan has a very low interest rate and a long repayment period, which is very beneficial to Indonesia's construction. Poland, famous for its shipbuilding industry, also signed an agreement with Indonesia last summer, preparing to build twenty-four ships for Indonesia before 1965.

Socialist countries sincerely and selflessly help Asian countries carry out industrial construction. The lack of oil is one of India's more serious problems. India's crude oil production is about 400,000 tons, and it must import more than 6 million tons of crude oil worth 1.5 billion rupees every year. The Soviet Union and Romania have given India tremendous assistance in developing its oil industry. In addition to supplying India with a large number of oil drilling machines and equipment, experts from these two countries have also helped India with large-scale exploration work. Under their close cooperation with Indian technicians, oil was discovered in the Cambay region of Bombay State last year. According to Soviet experts, the oil reserves in this area are at least 30 million tons. In order to develop oil resources, the Indian government has now decided to build two oil refineries in Assam and Bihar with the help of the Soviet Union and Romania.

The Soviet Union is also helping India build a steel plant with an annual steel production capacity of one million tons in Bhilai, which is one of the largest construction projects in India's Second Five-Year Plan. Czechoslovakia also supplies India with machines that it urgently needs under various preferential terms. In addition, it also helps India build various factories with complete sets of equipment. Two sugar refineries have already been completed. At present, it is also providing India with a foundry with a production capacity of 45,000 tons and a huge metallurgical plant.

The Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries also cooperate with Asian, African, and Latin American countries in science and technology. The Soviet Union has a special plan to train Indian technical personnel in helping India build the Bhilai steel plant. Each Soviet expert who helps India build the plant leads at least one Indian apprentice. In the three years after the plant starts production, Indian technicians will work on the one hand and continue to receive training from Soviet experts on the other. In addition, a large number of Indian engineers and technicians go to the Soviet Union to study.

Czechoslovakia has signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements with many Asian and African countries. At present, there are Czechoslovak experts working hard in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Republic. They help these countries develop their resources and carry out the design of important sectors such as agriculture, power, and processing industries.

The Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries also purchase traditional export commodities from Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The amount of cotton purchased by the Soviet Union from the UAR is increasing rapidly. Of all the cotton exported from Egypt, the proportion supplied to the Soviet Union accounted for only 6% in 1954-1955, but it already accounted for nearly 30% in 1956-1957. The Soviet Union is also a major purchaser of Egyptian rice. Unlike Western countries, the Soviet Union uses all the money earned from selling goods to the UAR to purchase Egyptian goods. Czechoslovakia is the second largest customer of Indian iron ore and the largest consumer of Egyptian cotton. The Soviet Union and Poland both purchase cocoa from Brazil. Argentina's wool, leather, linseed oil, and other commodities are very popular in Romania, Hungary, and other countries. As for India's traditional export commodities such as tea, spices, and mica, they have a very high reputation in socialist countries.

In contrast to the sincere mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries and underdeveloped countries, the United States adopts another policy toward these countries. 1958 was a year when the US economic crisis deepened. In this year, in order to shift its economic crisis, the United States carried out more rampant economic plunder of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It used the method of "buying cheap and selling expensive" and dumping surplus products to squeeze underdeveloped countries, causing their trade deficits to increase sharply, their foreign exchange reserves to plummet, and their national economies to suffer serious blows. Under such circumstances, the economic difficulties of these countries became more serious. As of November 21, 1958, the Philippines had a deficit of more than 104 million pesos (Philippine currency), and Pakistan's budget deficit for the 1958 fiscal year increased by 50% compared with 1957. The US restriction on oil imports forced Venezuela to reduce its oil extraction by 14%; restricting lead and zinc imports reduced Bolivia's lead and zinc sales by 40%, causing Peru to lose 20 million US dollars annually. In 1957, due to the US lowering the prices of imported raw materials, underdeveloped countries lost 4 billion US dollars in trade income, ten times the total "economic aid" provided by the United States to these countries in that year.

    真诚无私的援助　平等互惠的贸易
    社会主义国家同亚非和拉丁美洲国家经济合作不断发展
    新华社17日讯　本社记者报道：苏联和东欧社会主义国家同亚、非、拉丁美洲许多国家的经济合作在过去一年中又有了新的发展。一年来，这些社会主义国家除了同已有经济联系的国家如印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国等继续加强和扩大经济合作外，还和一系列的国家建立了新的经济联系。
    去年10月间，苏联以贷款四亿卢布的形式向阿根廷提供了大批的石油机器和设备。这项协定对阿根廷的石油工业以及整个国民经济的发展有着重大的意义，受到了阿根廷舆论的热烈欢迎。阿根廷“时报”曾经指出，这一协定是“阿根廷过去任何时候所签订的各项协定中最有利的一项”。
    在长期的停顿之后，苏联和巴西去年又恢复了贸易往来。根据去年10月两国间缔结的一项协定，苏联将以六万吨原油换取巴西的两万袋可可。这个开端使得巴西公众很感兴趣，他们中间要求同苏联恢复外交关系、扩大贸易范围的呼声愈来愈大。此外，波兰和巴西去年也签订了贸易协定，波兰向巴西输送煤、钢轨以及机器和设备，并且答应在三年之内为巴西建造十四艘船。
    去年苏联答应以四亿卢布贷款援助阿拉伯联合共和国修建阿斯旺水坝的消息，曾经使整个阿拉伯世界欢欣鼓舞，因为建筑高水坝以控制尼罗河河水并使它为生产服务，是埃及人民多年以来的希望。而美国和英国则曾经企图利用帮助修建这个水坝来进行无耻的政治勒索。现在，苏联和阿联双方已经签订了关于苏联为阿斯旺水坝第一期工程提供经济和技术援助的执行决议，苏联部长会议国家对外经济委员会副主席尼基京率领的一批苏联专家已在阿斯旺进行了现场研究，为水坝工程做好准备工作。
    苏联和几乎所有的东欧社会主义国家都和去年7月间成立的伊拉克共和国建立了经济合作关系。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国等把成套的工业设备、各种机器或者钢材、电讯器材、精密仪器和化学工业产品供给伊拉克，帮助它建立独立的民族工业。去年，德意志民主共和国和几内亚签订的贸易协定，是这个刚刚获得独立的国家的第一个对外贸易协定。
    去年，当印度尼西亚政府和人民对帝国主义所支持的叛乱集团进行坚决的斗争、国内经济遭受到一定困难的时候，苏联向它提供了一亿美元的贷款。这项贷款的利率很低，偿还期限很长，对印度尼西亚的建设十分有利。以造船业著名的波兰也在去年夏天和印度尼西亚签订了一项协定，准备在1965年以前为印度尼西亚建造二十四艘船。
    社会主义各国真诚无私地帮助亚洲国家进行工业建设。石油缺乏是印度较严重的问题之一。印度的原油产量大约为四十万吨，它每年必须输入价值为十五亿卢比的六百多万吨原油。苏联和罗马尼亚在发展石油工业方面给了印度巨大的援助。除了大量地供给印度以石油钻探机器和设备外，这两个国家的专家还帮助印度进行了大规模的勘探工作。在他们和印度技术人员的紧密合作下，去年在孟买邦的坎贝地区发现了石油。据苏联专家估计，这个地区的石油贮藏量至少有三千万吨。为了开发石油资源，现在印度政府已决定在苏联和罗马尼亚的帮助下，在阿萨姆邦和比哈尔邦建设两座炼油厂。
    苏联还在印度的比莱帮助建设一个年产钢铁一百万吨的炼钢厂，这是印度第二个五年计划中最大的建设项目之一。捷克斯洛伐克也以种种优惠条件向印度供应它所迫切需要的机器，此外，还以整套的设备帮助印度建立各种工厂，已经建成的有两座制糖厂。目前，它还为印度提供一座生产能力为四万五千吨的铸造厂和一座巨大的冶金厂。
    苏联和东欧各社会主义国家同亚、非、拉丁美洲国家还在科学技术方面进行合作。苏联在帮助印度建立比莱炼钢厂中，专门有一项训练印度技术人员的计划，每一个帮助印度建厂的苏联专家，至少带领一个印度见习生，在工厂开始生产后的三年中，印度技工一方面工作，一方面继续接受苏联专家的训练。此外，印度还有大批工程师和技工去苏联学习。
    捷克斯洛伐克和不少亚、非国家签订了科学技术合作协定。目前，在阿富汗、印度尼西亚、伊朗和阿拉伯联合共和国，都有捷克斯洛伐克的专家在辛勤地劳动，他们帮助这些国家开采富源，进行农业、动力和加工工业等重要部门的设计工作。
    苏联和东欧社会主义国家还从亚、非、拉丁美洲国家购买这些国家传统的出口商品。苏联购买阿联棉花的数量在迅速地增加着。在埃及全部出口的棉花中，供给苏联的部分在1954—1955年只占6％，但在1956—1957年已经占将近30％。苏联也是埃及的大米的主要购买者。同西方国家不同，苏联把全部卖给阿联的货物所换来的钱都用来购买埃及的货物。捷克斯洛伐克是印度铁矿砂的第二个最大的主顾，是埃及棉花的最大消费者。苏联、波兰都向巴西购买可可。阿根廷的羊毛、皮革、亚麻油等商品，很受罗马尼亚、匈牙利等国的欢迎。至于印度的传统出口商品如茶、香料、云母等，在社会主义国家中更有很高的声誉。
    同社会主义国家和经济不发达国家的真诚的互助和合作相反，美国对这些国家却采取另外一种政策。1958年是美国经济危机日益深重的一年。这一年，美国为了转嫁它的经济危机，对亚、非、拉丁美洲许多国家实行更加猖狂的经济掠夺。它以“贱买贵卖”和倾销剩余产品的办法，来压榨经济不发达的国家，使它们贸易逆差激增，外汇储备锐减，民族经济遭受到严重打击。在这种情况下，这些国家的经济困难更加严重了。到1958年11月21日止，菲律宾已有一亿零四百多万比索（菲币）的赤字，巴基斯坦1958财政年度的预算赤字比1957年度增加了50％。美国限制石油进口使委内瑞拉被迫减少14％的石油开采量；限制铅锌进口使玻利维亚的铅锌销售量减少40％，使秘鲁每年损失二千万美元。1957年，由于美国压低进口原料的价格，经济不发达的国家在贸易收入上就损失了四十亿美元，十倍于美国在这一年内向这些国家所提供的全部“经济援助”。（附图片）
