The silent underwater world

Qiu Jun

The ocean depths have always been called a mysterious world. Some people believe that in the ocean depths of thousands of meters, it is pitch black, cold, and silent, with no living things, not even bacteria, because there is no oxygen there. Sunlight is very weak in seawater, and no light can pass through below 1,500 meters. As for the water temperature below several thousand meters, it remains constant at one to two degrees Celsius throughout the year. The pressure in the ocean depths is even more astonishing: any creature on land would be crushed to pieces immediately upon arriving here. Someone once used an ordinary thermometer to measure the water temperature at a depth of more than 3,000 meters, and the thermometer was crushed. Seawater pressure increases with depth, increasing by one atmosphere for every ten meters. So at a depth of 10,000 meters, it would be equivalent to 1,000 atmospheres! What can resist such immense pressure? So far, there is no compressor in the world that can complete such powerful work.

In recent years, the development of science and the invention of various instruments have greatly helped people to explore the ocean depths.

How unimaginable it is that in the ocean depths where even thermometers are crushed, even below 10,000 meters, in a place that is both dark and cold, there is actually a world of life! Various marine animals and fish live there.

What force allows these creatures to survive in such a terrifying environment?

In order to find prey and be alert to enemy attacks in the dark, they generally have eyes and teeth that are disproportionately large for their bodies, and most have light-emitting organs, which are the only source of light in the cold, long night. But there are also those whose eye function has degenerated or who have no eyes at all, only extremely long tentacles, which serve as sensory organs for their movement and hunting. They are very ferocious and often devour each other. The corpses of animals and plants that fall from the upper layers of the sea are their delicacies. In order to resist the immense pressure of the seabed, their bones are very underdeveloped, like patients with severe osteomalacia. Muscle tissue is also underdeveloped, and various parts of the body have extremely strong permeability, allowing seawater to freely penetrate the body. In this way, the pressure inside the body is equal to the pressure of the water outside, and they do not feel suffocated living in such high-pressure water. Someone once brought this kind of fish to the surface very quickly, and because of the sudden decrease in external pressure, their appearance became even more ugly: their eyeballs protruded outward, their internal organs were squeezed out of their bellies, and their entire bodies became riddled with holes. But if they are slowly taken out of the water, the high-pressure water in their bodies will slowly seep out, and because the internal and external pressures are balanced, the fish body can still remain intact.

There are many types of deep-sea fish, and almost all of the fish in the upper layers of the sea can be found in the deep sea.

Because these marine animals and fish are so strangely shaped and ferocious, they look like "sea monsters" from mythology.

    寂静的海底世界
    秋君
    海洋深处一向被人们称为神秘的世界。有人认为，在深达数千公尺的海洋深处是漆黑一片、寒冷死寂的，没有生物，甚至连细菌都无法生存，因为那里没有氧气。阳光在海水中非常微弱，在一千五百公尺以下已通不过任何光线了。至于数千公尺以下的水温，那是终年保持在摄氏一度到两度。海洋深处压力之大更是惊人：陆地上的任何一种生物一来到这里，马上就会被压得粉身碎骨。曾有人用一架普通的温度计去测量三千多公尺深处的海水温度，结果温度计压碎了。海水压力随着深度的增加而加大，每深十公尺就要增加一个大气压。那么在一万公尺的深处就相当于一千个大气压了！有什么东西能抵御如此强大的压力呢？到目前为止，世界上还没有任何一种压缩机能完成如此强大的功率。
    近年来科学的发达以及各种仪器的发明，大大地帮助了人们对大洋深处的探索。
    多么难以想像，在连温度计都要被压得粉碎的大洋深处，甚至一万公尺以下，既黑暗又寒冷的地方，竟是一片生命的世界！那里栖息着各种各样的海生动物和鱼类。
    是什么力量使这些生命在这样可怕的环境下生活过来的呢？
    为了在黑暗中寻找猎食的对象和警觉敌人的袭击，一般都生有与它们的身体大得不相称的眼睛和牙齿，大部分都有发光器官，这是寒冷的长夜里的唯一光线的来源。但也有眼睛功能退化和根本没有眼睛的，只是长着极长的触须，作为它们行动和猎食的感觉器官。它们的性情很凶猛，常常是互相吞食。从海水上层落下来的动植物尸体更是它们的美餐。为了抵御海底强大的压力，它们的骨胳已很不发达，好像严重的软骨病患者。肌肉组织也不发达，身体各部有极强的渗透性，海水可自由渗入体内。这样身体内部的压力和外界水的压力相等，生活在这么大压力的水中也就不觉得憋气了。有人曾经把这种鱼非常迅速地提出水面，因为外界压力的骤然减小而使它们的外形变得更加丑陋不堪：眼球向外突出，内脏从肚中压出，整个鱼身变得百孔千疮。但是如果慢慢地把它们从水中取出，它们体内的高压水分也会慢慢渗出，由于内外压力得到平衡，鱼体仍能保持完整。
    深水鱼类的种类是非常多的，海水上层的鱼类几乎在深水中都能找到。
    由于这些海生动物和鱼类生得奇特，性情凶恶，所以看上去活像神话中的“海怪”。
