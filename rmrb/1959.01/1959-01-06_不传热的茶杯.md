    Non-Heat-Conducting Teacup
    The Jingdezhen Universe Porcelain Factory has successfully trial-produced a type of non-heat-conducting teacup.
    This type of cup has two layers and is manufactured based on the principle of a thermos bottle. When filled with boiling water at 100 degrees Celsius, it doesn't burn the hand at all. The weight of this teacup is one-third lighter than that of an ordinary teacup of the same size.

    不传热的茶杯
    景德镇宇宙瓷厂试制成功一种不传热的茶杯。
    这种杯子有两层，是仿照热水瓶原理制造的。装满一杯摄氏一百度的开水，一点也不烫手。这种茶杯的重量比同样大小的普通茶杯还轻三分之一。
