Xinhua News Agency, 6th, Dispatch from Moscow: TASS dispatch from Moscow time 19:05 on the 5th (Beijing time 0:05 on the 6th): TASS communiqué regarding the flight of the Soviet cosmic rocket.

    The Soviet cosmic rocket is continuing its flight.

    Due to the exhaustion of the power reserve, reliable radio communication with the rocket ceased at approximately 10:00 Moscow time on January 5th (15:00 Beijing time).

    By 10:00 Moscow time on January 5th (15:00 Beijing time), the cosmic rocket had traveled for sixty-two hours and was 597,000 kilometers away from Earth. Thirty-four hours after liftoff, it passed near the moon and is currently overcoming the gravitational forces of the Earth and moon, heading towards its orbit around the sun.

    Within the sixty-two hours, reliable radio communication between the rocket and Earth was achieved as planned. Based on this communication, the rocket's trajectory was observed, and information regarding the operation of the scientific instruments on the rocket was obtained.

    The cosmic rocket observation plan and scientific exploration plan have been completed.

    The cosmic rocket will finally enter the periodic orbit of an artificial planet on January 7th and 8th this year. The elements of this orbit have been previously reported.

    The orbit of the artificial planet is located between the orbits of Earth and Mars.

    The shortest distance between the artificial planet's orbit and Mars' orbit is approximately 15 million kilometers, which is about three-quarters less than the distance between Earth and Mars during Mars' opposition.

    The artificial planet's orbital period around the sun is four hundred and forty-seven Earth days. It will approach Earth again in approximately five years, but its distance from Earth will be tens of millions of kilometers.

    The missions predetermined at the launch of the cosmic rocket have been accomplished.

    In the further development of interplanetary rocket structure, valuable materials have been obtained, important results have been achieved in long-distance space radio communication, and a series of scientifically significant explorations have been conducted on some physical problems in outer space. These explorations can expand our knowledge of the universe. The scientific results obtained will be announced as soon as the observation data are processed.

    The Soviet cosmic rocket has forever become the first artificial planet in our solar system. Following the construction of the first artificial Earth satellite in the Soviet Union, the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket on January 2, 1959, is a great event in the era of building communism and has opened the epoch of interplanetary flight.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th, Dispatch from Moscow time 7:00 on the 5th (Beijing time 12:00): At 4:00 Moscow time on January 5th (9:00 Beijing time), the Soviet cosmic rocket was 550,000 kilometers away from Earth, 235,000 kilometers away from the moon, and continuing to move forward.

    At 4:00 Moscow time on January 5th (9:00 Beijing time), the rocket's coordinates were: right ascension 14 hours 18 minutes, declination minus 15 degrees 11 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th, Dispatch from TASS, Moscow time 23:50 on the 4th (Beijing time 4:50 on the 5th): At 22:00 Moscow time on the 4th (3:00 Beijing time on the 5th), the Soviet cosmic rocket was 510,000 kilometers away from Earth. The rocket's coordinates at this time were as follows: right ascension was 14 hours 17 minutes, and declination was minus 14.15 degrees.

    At 22:00 on the 4th (3:00 Beijing time on the 5th), the rocket was 180,000 kilometers away from the moon. The rocket continued to move forward, away from the Earth and moon.

    At 13:00 on the 4th (18:00 Beijing time), due to the Earth's rotation, the rocket left the visible area of the observation stations throughout the Soviet Union. At 1:00 on January 5th (6:00 Beijing time), the rocket will re-enter this area.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th, Dispatch from TASS, Moscow time 21:00 on the 4th (Beijing time 2:00 on the 5th): By 19:00 Moscow time on the 4th (0:00 Beijing time on the 5th), the Soviet cosmic rocket was 474,000 kilometers away from Earth.

    At this time, the rocket's coordinates were: right ascension 14 hours 17 minutes, declination minus 13.42 degrees.

    The rocket continued to move forward, away from the Earth and moon.

    苏联火箭科学考察成果辉煌
    丰富了星际飞行知识　探知了宇宙更多奥秘
    447个地球日绕太阳一圈　五年后重新接近地球
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科时间5日十九时五分（北京时间6日零时五分）讯：塔斯社关于苏联宇宙火箭飞行情况的公报
    苏联宇宙火箭正在继续飞行。
    由于电源电力储备用完，同火箭的可靠的无线电联系已经在1月5日莫斯科时间十时（北京时间十五时）左右停止。
    到1月5日莫斯科时间十时（北京时间十五时），宇宙火箭已经飞行了六十二小时，离地球已五十九万七千公里。途中在起飞三十四小时以后，它通过了月球附近，目前正在克服地球和月球引力，走向自己的围绕太阳运行的轨道。
    在六十二小时内，按照计划实现了火箭同地球的可靠的无线电联系，根据这种联系观测了火箭的运行，并获得了有关火箭上科学仪器工作情况的情报。
    对宇宙火箭的观测计划和科学考察计划已经结束。
    宇宙火箭将于今年1月7、8日最后进入人造行星的周期轨道。这个轨道的要素以前已经报道。
    人造行星的轨道位于地球轨道和火星轨道之间。
    人造行星轨道和火星轨道之间最短距离约为一千五百万公里，这比火星大冲时地球与火星距离大约小四分之三。
    人造行星在自己的轨道上围绕太阳运行一圈的时间是四百四十七个地球日，大约五年后重新接近地球，但是，它同地球的距离将有几千万公里。
    在发射宇宙火箭时所预定的任务已经完成。
    在进一步发展行星际火箭结构方面获得了珍贵的材料，在远距离宇宙无线电联系方面取得了重要结果，在宇宙空间一些物理问题上进行了一系列具有巨大科学意义的考察，这些考察可以扩大我们关于宇宙的知识。已获得的科学结果将随着对观测资料的整理随时公布。
    苏联宇宙火箭永远成为我们太阳系的第一个人造行星。在苏联建成第一个人造地球卫星以后，在1959年1月2日发射了苏联宇宙火箭，这是建设共产主义时代的伟大事件，揭开了行星际飞行的纪元。
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社5日莫斯科时间七时（北京时间十二时）讯：1月5日莫斯科时间四时（北京时间九时），苏联宇宙火箭离地球已五十五万公里，离月球二十三万五千公里，并且在继续前进中。
    1月5日莫斯科时间上午四时（北京时间九时），火箭座标为：赤经十四时十八分，赤纬负十五度十一分。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科时间4日二十三时五十分（北京时间5日四时五十分）讯：莫斯科时间4日二十二时（北京时间5日三时）正，苏联宇宙火箭距地球五十一万公里。在这个时间内的火箭座标如下：赤经为十四时十七分，而赤纬是负一四点一五度。
    1月4日二十二时（北京时间5日三时）正，火箭离开月球十八万公里。火箭继续离开地球和月球向前运行。
    4日十三时（北京时间十八时）正，由于地球旋转的关系，火箭离开了苏联各地观测站的能见区域。1月5日一时（北京时间六时）正，火箭将重又进入这个区域。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科时间4日二十一时（北京时间5日二时）讯：到莫斯科时间4日十九时（北京时间5日零时）为止，苏联宇宙火箭距地球四十七万四千公里。
    在这个时间火箭的座标为：赤经十四时十七分，赤纬负一三点四二度。
    火箭继续离开地球和月球向前运行。
