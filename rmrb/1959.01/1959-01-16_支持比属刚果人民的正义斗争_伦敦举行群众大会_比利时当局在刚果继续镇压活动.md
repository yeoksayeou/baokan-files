Xinhua News Agency, London, January 14th. A mass rally initiated by the London District Committee of the British Communist Party on the evening of the 13th expressed support for the struggle of the people of the Belgian Congo against oppression and for democratic rights.

    The conference sent a telegram to the Belgian Ambassador in London, demanding that the Belgian government "stop the bloody suppression and grant independence to the Congo."

    The conference also passed a resolution calling on labor movement organizations and progressive people in London to demand an independent legal investigation by the British government into the allegation that Lawson Machiria, the main prosecution witness in the trial of Kenyan African Union leader Jomo Kenyatta, received bribes and gave false testimony.

    Another telegram to Macmillan stated that, in view of the complete failure of the government's plan for Cyprus, negotiations must be held immediately with representatives of the Cypriot people in order to reach an agreement.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th. TASS, London: Speaking at a mass rally in London on the 13th, the Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, Palme Dutt, stressed that the All-African People's Conference held in Accra not long ago was "a great victory for African unity, which overcame the artificial obstacles laid down by imperialism."

    Dutt believed that the scale of this conference was unprecedented, with representatives from almost all African countries gathering together to speak on African soil and declare their determination to fight for African freedom.

    Dutt spoke of the amazing and rapid achievements of the African liberation movement, and pointed out the great role of the Bandung Conference in this regard.

    Referring to the current events in the Belgian Congo, Dutt emphasized: "The idea of African liberation has now taken hold of all regions, even those regions that the colonialists call passive." He said that everyone now sees that the illusion of restoring the power of Western European capitalism on the basis of ruling Africa and exploiting its people has been shattered.

    Dutt called on the conference participants to strengthen solidarity with the peoples of African countries who are fighting for freedom and independence.

    Xinhua News Agency, January 15th. Leopoldville: While making vague promises of future independence for the Congo, the Belgian government is continuing to suppress the Congolese people. According to the Belgian colonial authorities, police authorities have arrested and charged 243 people since the riots, 20 of whom are minors. The colonial authorities have also unreasonably prosecuted Patrice Lumumba, the chairman of the Congolese nationalist organization "ABAKO", Vice-Chairman Kanza, and the other eleven members of this organization. These people have been detained in prison since their arrest.

    The city of Leopoldville is still completely controlled by the police and army, including paratrooper units recently shipped in from Belgium to suppress the Congolese people.

    支持比属刚果人民的正义斗争
    伦敦举行群众大会
    比利时当局在刚果继续镇压活动
    新华社伦敦14日电　英国共产党伦敦区委员会13日晚上发起的一次群众大会表示支持比属刚果人民反对压迫、争取民主权利的斗争。
    大会打电报给比利时驻伦敦大使，要求比利时政府“停止血腥镇压，给刚果独立”。
    大会还通过了决议，号召伦敦劳工运动各组织以及进步人民要求英国政府对怯尼亚非洲联盟领导人肯雅塔审讯案中检察方面的主要证人劳逊·梅契里雅受贿作了伪证的这种说法进行独立的法律调查。
    另一封致麦克米伦的电报说，鉴于政府关于塞浦路斯的计划完全失败，必须立即同塞浦路斯人民的代表进行谈判以便达成协议。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会副主席杜德13日在伦敦举行的群众大会上讲话时强调指出，不久以前在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会是“非洲团结的巨大胜利，这种团结克服了帝国主义布下的人为障碍”。
    杜德认为，这次会议的规模是史无前例的，差不多所有非洲国家的代表都聚会一堂，在非洲土地上发言，宣布争取非洲自由的决心。
    杜德谈到了非洲解放运动惊人迅速地获得的成就，并且指出了万隆会议在这方面的巨大作用。
    杜德在谈到目前比属刚果的事件时强调指出：“非洲解放的思想现在已经掌握了一切地区，甚至掌握了殖民主义者称为处在消极状态的那些地区。”他说，现在大家都看到，在统治非洲和剥削它的人民的基础上恢复西欧资本主义威力的幻想已经破灭了。
    杜德号召大会参加者加强同正在为自由和独立而斗争的非洲各国人民的团结。
    新华社15日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：比利时政府在提出将来让刚果独立的空泛诺言的同时，正在继续对刚果人民进行镇压。据比利时殖民当局宣布，暴动以后，警察当局已经逮捕和控告了二百四十三人，其中有二十人是少年。殖民当局还无理地对刚果民族主义组织
  “阿巴科”的主席卡萨武布、副主席坎札以及这个组织的其他十一名委员提出起诉。这些人被逮捕以后一直拘留在监狱中。
    利奥波德维尔市仍然完全由警察和军队控制着，其中包括新近从比利时运来镇压刚果人民的伞兵部队。
