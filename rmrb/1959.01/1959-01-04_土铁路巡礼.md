A Tour of the Indigenous Railroad
By our reporters Guo Jie and Fan Yinhuai

The first civilian-run indigenous railroad in the country has been open to traffic for five months.

Recently, we took a bus from Yangquan to Meng County, the home of the indigenous railroad. The highway built in the desolate mountains and ridges is like a winding ribbon. The往来transport vehicles crowded this highway. The public bus we were riding in weaved through large trucks, mule carts, and small ox carts loaded with ore and coke, and sometimes had to stop constantly to give way to these vehicles. Here, people were given a magnificent picture of industrial construction in the mountainous areas, but it also left people with the impression that the transportation situation in Meng County was very tense.

After a two-hour bus ride, we arrived in Meng County. As soon as we got off the bus, we headed towards the northeast of the city to inspect this nationally famous indigenous railroad. The indigenous railroad is nestled at the foot of the mountain, next to a dry riverbed, passing many bridges, culverts, and forests along the way. On both sides, the chimneys of steel plants, machinery plants, and coking plants spewed out thick smoke. Not far past the Second Steel Plant is the Sunjiazhuang Station.

Sunjiazhuang Station is a stop on this indigenous railroad. The current indigenous railroad runs from Shidian to here. As soon as we entered the station, a train was approaching, with carriages full of coke, and also commune members from the villages along the way, who were passengers taking their own indigenous train to the road construction site and factories. The device and structure of the indigenous train is small and flexible. The locomotive, converted from a heavy-duty truck, pulls six carriages. It removes the rubber tires, lengthens the front and rear axles, and installs iron wheels to run on the tracks. The rails and iron wheels, cast from pig iron, are all products of the county's machinery repair and manufacturing plant. Each train can carry 50 tons and can travel back and forth between the coking plant and the machinery repair and manufacturing plant, which are more than three *li* apart, every six minutes.

Three *li* east of Sunjiazhuang Station is the starting point of the indigenous railroad, Shidian Station. This is the coking base of Meng County, surrounded by mountains on both sides, with a deep ditch in the middle. The coking ovens resemble circular fortresses, arranged in rows along the ditch. The coking oven complex belches out billowing red smoke. Comrade Liu Pixu of the indigenous railroad headquarters, who came with us, told us that the coke here, in addition to supplying the county's steel base, is also sold far to Yangquan and Tianjin. In the past, without the indigenous railroad, no fewer than two hundred vehicles and pack animals came to transport coke every day, making this narrow ditch often crowded and impassable. Since the train runs to Sunjiazhuang, the number of livestock and vehicles here has been greatly reduced. Now only the two steel plants in Yangquan and Chengguan and Taoyuan come here. Soon, when the indigenous railroad is fully opened to traffic, the coke needed by the two steel plants along the line can be delivered to their doorsteps.

In fact, after the opening of the indigenous railroad from Shidian to Sunjiazhuang, it not only solved the current transportation problem of the coking plant, but more importantly, it created favorable conditions for the development of production in the coking plant and the 55 Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant, enabling the development of the rich iron ore near Shidian. In the past, the coking plant in Shidian could not ship out more production due to inconvenient transportation, and could only produce more than 100 tons per day; but now that the railway is smooth, it can travel back and forth from Sunjiazhuang every six minutes, and their coke production has jumped to more than 300 tons per day. Soon, when the railway reaches Chengguan, the production speed of coke will increase by multiples, tens of times, and dozens of times. There is no longer any worry that the products cannot be shipped out.

The Sunjiazhuang 55 Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant, which is located across from the Shidian Coking Plant, is a factory that is "fully equipped" from smelting and sand casting to machine manufacturing. However, before the indigenous railroad transportation, this was only a handicraft iron production cooperative. At that time, the entire factory only had one indigenous furnace and a few dilapidated machine tools. Because blast furnace ironmaking requires coke, there were one or twenty rubber-wheeled carts transporting it back and forth on this narrow mountain road every day. When we stepped into this factory, a middle-aged man dressed in worker's clothes warmly welcomed us into the house and introduced us to the changes in their factory after the railway was opened to traffic. It turned out that he was the factory director, Fu Zhibin. He told us that when the train arrived at the factory gate last July, coke and ore came in continuously, and the factory began to formulate a plan for developing production, and started to build two foreign blast furnaces and make machine tools, transforming from a handicraft iron industry cooperative into a comprehensive machinery manufacturing plant that is "literate and martial".

In the minds of the people of Meng County, the construction and opening of the indigenous railroad has shown a beautiful picture of building socialism in mountainous areas. What was once called a "dead end" has been found to be full of golden ore, black coke, sparkling dolomite, and aluminum ore everywhere during the Great Leap Forward in Steel, and two steel plants, two machinery plants, and a coking plant have been built, turning treasures that have been sleeping for many years into steel and machines. At that time, transporting these materials and equipment became the most important thing for the people of Meng County. There was a period of time when they used all the iron-wheeled horse carts in the county and thousands of manual laborers, but they still felt it was not enough. The Meng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was determined to lead the masses to build the indigenous railroad.

On the day the indigenous railroad opened to traffic, farmers who had never seen a railroad came from dozens of *li* away to visit this railway that they built themselves. Commune members take the little train to the city or other factories. Zheng Cunren, an old farmer in Sunjiazhuang in his seventies, sat on the indigenous train and said with a smile, "I have to live a few more years to live this socialist life!"

"If we can build an indigenous railroad, we can build more and longer indigenous railroads." We heard these words at the county party committee, and we also saw the confidence and strength of the people of the whole county in building indigenous railroads from reality. When we returned to the county seat from Sunjiazhuang Station, we walked on the ten-*li*-long roadbed of this indigenous railroad. After this railroad is built, it will connect with the Shidian to Sunjiazhuang section that has already been opened to traffic, connecting the First and Second Steel Plants and the coke and ore base in the Shidian area.

Now, more than 1,000 commune members from six people's communes in the county have been drawn out to form a "cooperation army", carrying out large-scale earth and stone works here. Thousands of picks are waving on the construction site, and small flatbed carts and basket teams transporting sand and stones are constantly flowing. They are organized into "field battalions" and "backbone companies", bringing their own food and meal money, and rushing from rural areas dozens of *li* away to build indigenous railroads. In this extremely cold plateau area, the soil one foot away from the ground has already frozen, but the farmers have put forward the slogan: "For the sake of indigenous railroadization, we are not afraid of cold weather", and are working hard to fight.

    土铁路巡礼
    本报记者　郭洁　范银怀
    全国第一条民办土铁路通车已经五个月了。
    最近，我们在阳泉搭乘公共汽车来到土铁路的家乡——盂县。建设在荒山巨岭中的公路像一条曲折的飘带。往来的运输车辆拥满了这条公路。我们乘坐的公共汽车在满载矿石、焦炭的大卡车、骡马车、小牛车中穿行，有时还得不断停下来，为这些车辆让路。这里，给人们描绘出了一幅山区工业建设的壮丽图景，但是也给人们留下了这样的印象：盂县的运输状况是很紧张的。
    车行两小时到了盂县城。我们一下汽车便向城东北方向进发，巡视这条全国著名的土铁路。土铁路依在山脚下，傍着一条干河道，沿途经过许多桥涵、沟渠和树林。两旁，钢铁厂、机械厂、炼焦厂的烟囱冒着团团浓烟。绕过第二钢铁厂不远，就是孙家庄车站。
    孙家庄车站是这条土铁路的一个中途停车站。现在的土铁路就从石店通车到这里。我们刚进站，一列火车正迎面驶来，车厢里满载着焦炭，还有沿途村庄的公社社员们，他们是乘坐自己的土火车到筑路工地和工厂去的旅客。土火车的装置和构造小巧灵便。用载重汽车改装成的机车，牵引着六节车厢。它卸掉胶轮带，加长前后轴，安上铁轮，就能在铁轨上行驶。用生铁浇铸成的道轨、铁轮，都是这个县机械修造厂的产品。每列车可以载重五十吨，每六分钟就能在相距三华里多的炼焦厂、机械修造厂之间往返一次。
    孙家庄车站东伸三华里，便是土铁路的起点石店车站。这里是盂县的炼焦基地，两面依山，中间有一条深沟。炼焦炉好像圆形的堡垒一样，一个个顺沟排列成行。炼焦炉群吐出滚滚红烟。领我们同来的土铁路指挥部的刘丕绪同志告诉我们：这里的焦炭，除了供应全县钢铁基地外，还远销到阳泉、天津。过去没有土铁路，每天来拉运焦炭的车辆和驮畜不下二百辆，使这个狭窄的小沟常常挤得水泄不通。火车一通到孙家庄，这里的牲畜、车辆就减少好多。现在来这里的只剩阳泉和城关、桃园两个钢铁厂了。不久，土铁路全线通车，沿线两个钢铁厂所需要的焦炭就可以送货上门了。
    其实，从石店到孙家庄的土铁路通车后，不仅解决了当前炼焦厂的运输问题，更重要的还是为炼焦厂和五五机械修造厂发展生产创造了有利的条件，使石店附近的丰富的铁矿石得以开发。过去，石店的炼焦厂由于交通不便，生产多了就运不出去，每天只能生产一百多吨；而如今铁路畅通，每六分钟就可从孙家庄往返一趟，他们的焦炭生产一跃为日产三百多吨了。不久铁路通到城关，焦炭的生产速度将会成倍、十倍、几十倍地增长。再不愁产品运不出去了。
    和石店炼焦厂遥遥相对的孙家庄五五机械修造厂，是一个从冶炼、翻砂到机器制造“肝胆齐全”的工厂。但是，在没有土铁路运输的时候，这只是一个手工业铁业生产合作社。那时全厂只有一个土方炉和几部破旧的机床。因为高炉炼铁要用焦，每天就有一、二十辆胶轮大车往返在这条狭窄的山路上运输。当我们踏进这个工厂的时候，一位身着工人服装的中年人热情地迎我们进屋，向我们介绍他们厂在铁路通车后的变化。原来他就是这个厂的厂长傅志斌。他告诉我们：去年7月火车通到厂门口，焦炭、矿石源源而来，厂里就开始制订了发展生产的规划，并动手兴建两座洋高炉和大造机床，由一个手工业铁业合作社发展成“能文能武”的综合性的机械修造厂。
    在盂县人民的心目中，土铁路的建成和通车，展现出了山区建设社会主义的美景。过去被人们称为“山穷水尽”的地方，在大闹钢铁运动中发现到处是黄澄澄的矿石、乌黑的焦炭、亮晶晶的白云石、铝矿……，并且已经建起两座钢铁厂、两座机器厂和炼焦厂，把沉睡多年的宝藏变成了钢铁和机器。那时，运送这些物资、器材就成了盂县人民最关切的大事。曾有一个时期，他们运用了全县所有的铁轮马车和几千个人力担运都嫌不足。中共盂县县委下决心领导群众建成了土铁路。
    土铁路通车那天，从来没有见过铁路的农民，从数十里外赶来参观这条自己修建的铁路。社员们进城或到别的工厂时都要来乘上一段小火车。孙家庄一位七十多岁的老农民郑存仁坐在土火车上笑盈盈地说：“我可要多活几年哩，好过过这社会主义生活！”
    “能修成一段土铁路，就能建设更多、更长的土铁路。”我们在县委听到这样的话，也从实际中看到全县人民大建土铁路的信心和力量。我们从孙家庄车站回县城的时候，就是踏着这条绵延十华里的土铁路路基走的。这条铁路建成后，就和已经通车的石店至孙家庄段接轨，把第一、第二钢铁厂和石店一带的焦炭、矿石基地连接起来。
    现在，全县六个人民公社抽出一千多名社员，组成“协作大军”，在这里大兴土、石方工程，工地上千百支镢头在挥舞，运送砂石的小平车、箩筐队川流不息。他们编成“野战营”、“基干连”，自带粮食、菜金，从数十里外的农村赶来修土铁路。在这奇寒的高原地带，离地表一尺的土都已经封冻，但农民们提出：“为了土铁路化，天寒地冻都不怕”的口号，努力奋战。（附图片）
