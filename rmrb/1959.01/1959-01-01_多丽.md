    Duoli (Ode to Beauty)
    Li Jishen
    Ode to New Year's Day, 1959
    What beautiful rivers and mountains! The magnificent construction is boundless. The warm sun and gentle breeze of spring return to the earth, and the east wind blows warmth and adds beauty. We rejoice in the soaring enthusiasm of all the people, and the wise leadership is renowned throughout the world. The sprouts of communism emerge, the foundation of the Great Harmony is laid, and the people's communes take the lead. Looking back at the rectification campaign, the struggle against the Rightists, the destruction and establishment are clear. The General Line, ten thousand atomic units, unprecedented power.
    It is impossible to count completely, the leaps forward in industry and agriculture, transportation and electricity first. The banner of command is unfurled, grain, steel, and machinery; satellites are launched, coal and cotton. Education is combined, learning and production, talent becomes multifaceted and new. The great journey unfolds, the Sixth Plenary Session's documents, reaching even higher. Let us all be excited and energetic, with high morale, and greet the New Year!

    一九五九年元旦颂
    好江山。辉煌建设无边。煦阳和、春回大地，东风拂暖增妍。喜全民、冲天干劲，贤领导、举世称传。共产萌芽，大同基奠，人民公社着先鞭。溯整风、斗争反右，破立事了然。总路线、万千原子，动力空前。
    数难完、工农跃进，交通电力当先。帅旗张、粮钢机械，卫星放、煤炭皮棉。教育结连，习劳生产，才成多面纪新元。鹏程展、六中文件，更上一重天。齐兴奋轩、昂斗志，迎接新年！
