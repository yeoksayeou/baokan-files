    A winter five-production movement (intensive cultivation, water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, afforestation, and sideline production) of even greater scale than last year is vigorously unfolding in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958, with grain output increasing by 112% compared to 1957. In order to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, the entire region began to launch the winter five-production movement from the beginning of December last year. After a month of efforts, significant achievements have been made in various productions. Deep plowing area reached 8.98 million mu, accounting for 38.8% of the planned deep plowing area, of which about 80% reached more than eight inches, and about 30% combined stratification fertilization to improve the soil. In general, it was four or five inches deeper than the winter plowing in the previous year. In terms of water conservancy construction, Yongning, Tianyang and other seventeen counties with particularly serious drought were taken as the key points to drive the overall situation. At present, some projects have been completed ahead of schedule. The manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement is also in full swing in various places, and more than 2.5 billion dan of various fertilizers have been accumulated and produced, which is five times that of the same period last year, and the quality has also been improved compared with last year. At the same time, sideline production has also become active in various places. The funds invested in the purchase of agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products in the fourth quarter of last year increased by nearly two times compared with the same period of the previous year. The development of sideline production has guaranteed that the vast majority of communes in the region can issue wages to their members on time. In addition, as a prelude to this year's large-scale afforestation movement, some areas have already created the first batch of trees, and the afforestation movement in the entire region will form a climax around the Spring Festival.

    The reason why the Autonomous Region's winter five-production movement can quickly set off a climax is mainly because it has firmly grasped the central link of rationally arranging labor. The five-production movement was carried out on the basis of the double leap forward in steel and grain production in the Autonomous Region. At that time, more than half of the rural labor force participated in the large-scale steel production movement, and the labor force was very tight. In order to better implement the policy of combining industry and agriculture and rapidly and vigorously carry out the five-production movement, on the one hand, various places fixed the necessary labor force to ensure that the steel movement was transformed into base-oriented and factory-oriented normal production, and at the same time, transferred the strength of the steel army to invest in the five-production movement. The specific arrangement of the labor force emphasizes that according to the specific circumstances of various places, grasping the center, distinguishing the primary and secondary, and taking overall consideration. In terms of labor organization and management, it is emphasized that the superiority of the people's commune should be fully utilized to organize various specialized production teams with fixed personnel, establish a responsibility system, and at the same time organize a certain mobile team. This can not only ensure the normal production, but also adapt to the needs of temporary tasks, and at the same time it is conducive to tapping labor potential and improving labor efficiency. For example, Guixian County is a county with severe drought, and the tasks of water conservancy construction and deep plowing are very heavy. The county adopted the method of "roads have soldiers, lines have generals, highlighting the center, and distinguishing the primary and secondary", and specifically arranged the labor force and established a fixed labor force according to the work tasks of each period. The county party committee divided the work, and people were in charge of all fronts, and the central work was very prominent, and at the same time, the five major production movements were fully developed. In mid-December, the county had basically completed the task of deep plowing of 500,000 mu of paddy fields. In late December, 61 water conservancy projects had been started, ranking at the forefront of the region, and manure accumulation and sideline production also had great development.

    深耕、水利、积肥、造林、副业全面安排
    生产劲头今年更比去年大
    本报讯　一个规模比去年更大的冬季五大生产运动（深耕、修水利、积肥、造林、副业生产），正在广西僮族自治区蓬勃展开。
    广西僮族自治区1958年农业生产大丰收，粮食产量比1957年增长112％。为了实现1959年农业生产的更大更好更全面的跃进，从去年12月初开始，全区即开始展开冬季五大生产运动。经过一个月来的努力，各项生产都取得了很大成绩，深耕面积达八百九十八万亩，占计划深耕面积的38.8％，其中80％左右达到八寸以上，30％左右结合进行了分层施肥，改良土壤，一般比前年的冬耕深耕了四、五寸。在兴修水利方面，以干旱特别严重的邕宁、田阳等十七个县作为重点，带动全面。目前，有部分工程已提前完工。积肥制肥运动在各地来势也很猛烈，已经积制各种肥料达二十五亿多担，等于去年同期的五倍，质量也比去年提高。与此同时，各地副业生产也活跃起来，去年第四季度全区收购农、副、土特产品的投放资金，比前年同期增加了将近两倍。副业生产的开展，保证了全区绝大多数公社按期给社员发放工资。此外，作为今年大规模造林运动的先声，有的地区已营造了第一批林木，全区造林运动将在春节前后形成高潮。
    自治区的冬季五大生产运动能够较快地掀起高潮，主要是由于紧紧抓住了合理安排劳动力这一中心环节。五大生产运动是在自治区钢铁和粮食生产双双跃进的基础上开展起来的。当时农村半数以上的劳动力参加大办钢铁运动，劳动力很紧张。为了更好地贯彻工农业并举的方针，迅速有力地开展五大生产运动，各地一方面固定必要的劳动力，保证使钢铁运动转入基地化、工厂化的正常生产，同时，抽调钢铁大军的力量投入五大生产运动。对劳动力的具体安排，则强调根据各地具体情况，抓住中心，分清主次，统筹兼顾。在劳动力的组织管理方面，强调充分运用人民公社的优越性，组织有固定人员的各项专业生产队，建立责任制度，同时组织一定的机动队伍。这样既能保证正常性生产的进行，又能适应临时性任务的需要，同时又有利于挖掘劳动潜力，提高劳动效率。如贵县是一个干旱严重的县，修水利和深耕任务都很重。该县采取路路有兵、线线有将、中心突出、主次分明的办法，根据每一时期的工作任务，具体地安排劳动力，建立固定的劳动队伍。县委分工、条条战线有人领导，中心工作抓得非常突出，同时使五大生产运动获得全面开展。12月中旬，该县已基本完成五十万亩稻田的深耕任务，下旬，水利工程已开工六十一处，走在全区的前列，积肥和副业生产也有很大的发展。
