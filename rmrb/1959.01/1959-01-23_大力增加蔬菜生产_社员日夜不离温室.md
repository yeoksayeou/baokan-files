Vigorously Increase Vegetable Production: Commune Members Stay in Greenhouses Day and Night

After the snowfall, the weather was very cold, which was quite detrimental to the growth of winter vegetables. In order to increase vegetable production, the members of the Yangqi team of the Changqing Commune in Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province, are fighting against the severe cold day and night. When they couldn't buy grass, they used more than 300 paper quilts to replace grass mats. They also followed the suggestion of technician Zhou Bingyuan to change the large stove in the greenhouse into a fire wall, so that the indoor temperature rose from twelve degrees to sixteen degrees, allowing the vegetables to grow rapidly in a suitable temperature.

In order to cultivate vegetables, the commune members stay in the greenhouse day and night. They are not only busy with cultivation, fertilization, and watering during the day, but also have more than a dozen people working the night shift to be responsible for heating. The winter vegetables in the greenhouse are very delicate. For example, eggplant seedlings need drier soil; if it is too wet, the seedlings will rot. If the temperature is too low, they will not grow or shrink; if the temperature is too high, they will grow too thin or wither. All kinds of vegetables have their own different requirements, and problems will arise if they are not managed well. The commune members stay in the greenhouse every day, carefully observing the growth of various vegetables, and carry out various management activities such as temperature adjustment, fertilization, and watering according to their needs.

With the hard work and careful cultivation of the commune members, the vegetables in each greenhouse are growing vigorously. More than 52,000 jin of fresh vegetables will be on the market before the Spring Festival. In addition, the first batch of vegetables this spring has been sown successively, and people will be able to eat fresh and delicious cucumbers, tomatoes and other vegetables in April and May.

    大力增加蔬菜生产  社员日夜不离温室
    降雪以后，天气十分寒冷，对冬菜的生长颇为不利。辽宁省辽阳市常青公社阳畦队的社员们，为了增加蔬菜生产，日日夜夜在跟严寒作斗争。在买不到草的情况下，他们就利用三百多床纸被代替草垫子。他们又根据技术员周秉元的建议，将温室里的大炉子改成火墙，这样室内的温度就由十二度上升到十六度，使蔬菜在适宜的温度下迅速成长。
    为了培育蔬菜，社员们日夜不离温室。他们不但白天忙着栽培、施肥和浇水，晚间还有十多个人做夜班，负责生火加温。温室里的冬菜非常娇气。如茄苗，它需要土壤干些，潮湿了芽苗要烂脖，温度低了它不长或萎缩，温度高了就长得细高或枯黄。各种蔬菜都自有不同的要求，如管理不好就出问题。社员们每天都守候在温室里，仔细地观察各种菜的生长情况，按它们的需要进行调温、施肥、浇水等各项管理活动。
    在社员们的辛勤劳动和精心培育下，目前各个温室里的蔬菜长得茁壮茂盛。春节前将有五万二千多斤鲜菜上市。另外，这个队今春第一批蔬菜已陆续播种，在4、5月间，人们就可以吃到鲜嫩可口的黄瓜、西红柿等蔬菜。
