Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 9th: The largest canal coal port in our country, the Xuzhou Coal Port, is about to officially begin construction.

The Xuzhou Coal Port is located next to Wanzhai Village in the northern suburbs of Xuzhou City. The Shuanglou and Pixian Coal Ports near Xuzhou will also begin construction at the same time as the Xuzhou Coal Port.

After these three canal coal ports are completed, they can transport the coal from the Xuzhou area to the south of the Yangtze River, Shanghai, and other places via the Grand Canal in a timely manner. At the same time, Xuzhou will become a water and land transportation hub.

    徐州筹建运河煤港
    据新华社南京9日电　目前我国最大的运河煤港——徐州煤港，即将正式动工兴建。
    徐州煤港座落在徐州市北郊万寨村旁边。跟徐州煤港同时开工的，还有徐州附近的双楼、邳县煤港。
    这三座运河煤港建成以后，可以及时地把徐州地区的煤炭，由大运河运往江南上海等地；同时，徐州将变为一个水陆交通咽喉。
