Xinhua News Agency, December 31st. This reporter reports: In the international competition of natural sciences in 1958, the Soviet Union made further rapid progress, while the United States appeared to lag behind step by step. This situation is most prominent in the cutting-edge science and technology fields of artificial satellites, rockets, and atomic energy, which are currently attracting worldwide attention.

In conquering outer space, the level the Soviet Union has reached is unparalleled in the world. On May 15, 1958, the Soviet Union launched its third satellite, weighing about one and a half tons and about the size of a small car, into outer space, where it is still operating. This is a huge leap forward in Soviet science. It is not only about two and a half times the weight of the Soviet Union's second satellite, but also has an unprecedentedly wide range of scientific investigations, incorporating all the high-altitude investigation projects pre-scheduled for the International Geophysical Year into its metal belly.

In the cutting-edge science department of artificial satellites, which is most likely to arouse public interest, the United States mobilized particularly great forces to catch up with the Soviet Union. The Army, Navy, and Air Force were all dispatched, and according to announcements, fourteen official launches resulted in five successes. The combined weight of the five satellites is only about one-fourteenth of the weight of the Soviet Union's third satellite. Some of these satellites are as small as grapefruits, and some have a lifespan as short as only twenty days. Moreover, the scope of scientific investigation is also much smaller than that of Soviet satellites.

In 1958, the United States also stubbornly hoped to use an intermediate-range rocket to launch the "world's first" artificial lunar satellite. According to Dr. Pickering, a rocket expert at the California Institute of Technology, the United States was "trying to run before it had learned to walk." The result was four consecutive failures. By mid-December, the United States finally launched a satellite with an effective weight of 67.5 kilograms. This satellite is much lighter than the first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in October 1957.

In connection with artificial satellites, the United States is also far behind the Soviet Union in terms of the development level of rocket technology. The Soviet Union announced as early as August 1957 that it had developed an intercontinental ballistic missile and used this rocket to launch the world's first artificial satellite. The United States did not announce until the end of November 1958 that an "Atlas" intercontinental missile had completed its entire range. While the United States made this progress, Soviet rocket technology had made new progress. In August 1958, the Soviet Union launched a single-stage rocket carrying 1,690 kilograms to an altitude of 450 kilometers. The weight of the third satellite launched by the Soviet Union is almost fifteen times that of the first satellite it launched. While the American propaganda machine was touting the "Atlas" missile's first achievement of intercontinental range, the famous American rocket expert Braun announced that he still held his original view: "The United States still needs five years to catch up with the Soviet Union in rockets."

In September 1958, the first phase of the world's largest atomic power plant built by the Soviet Union was completed and began generating electricity. The total power generation capacity of this power plant is 600,000 kilowatts, and the power generation capacity of the first phase alone reaches 100,000 kilowatts. The United States' first atomic power plant, the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, was not officially put into production until May 1958. That is to say, it was almost four years later than the Soviet Union's first atomic power plant, and its power generation capacity was only 60,000 kilowatts.

All three atomic reactors of the world's first atomic icebreaker built by the Soviet Union have been installed, and ground tests began in October 1958. This icebreaker has extremely reliable safety protection equipment, and even only three meters away from the atomic reactor, the radiation intensity does not exceed the tolerable level. The United States does not yet have transportation vehicles for peaceful purposes. The United States has manufactured atomic submarines, but has not completely solved the safety problems of such ships.

In the construction of basic particle accelerators, which are of great significance for deeply exploring the secrets of the atomic nucleus, the 10 billion electron volt synchrophasotron near Moscow is currently the largest accelerator in the world. In addition, an accelerator with an energy of 50 billion electron volts is being manufactured at the Leningrad Institute of Electrical Physics. The energy of an accelerator that the United States is rushing to manufacture is only half of the above.

In the field of controllable thermonuclear reactions, the Soviet Union built the famous "Ogla" device in the summer of 1958, and exhibited another "Alpha" thermonuclear research device that had begun operating at the Geneva Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Exhibition. Using these devices, the problem of achieving stable thermonuclear reactions can in principle be put on the agenda. The United States is far behind the Soviet Union in this regard.

### 在1958年的科学竞赛中  苏联一马当先　美国望尘莫及

    在1958年的科学竞赛中
    苏联一马当先　美国望尘莫及
    新华社12月31日讯　本社记者报道：在1958年自然科学的国际竞赛中，苏联进一步突飞猛进，美国则显得一步拖后一步。这种情况最突出地表现在当前举世瞩目的人造卫星、火箭、原子能等尖端科学技术方面。
    在征服宇宙空间方面，苏联所已经达到的水平是举世无匹的。1958年5月15日，苏联把重约一吨半、大小相当一辆小轿车的第三个卫星发射到了宇宙空间，直到现在它还在天上运行。这是苏联科学一个巨大的跃进。它不仅在重量上等于苏联第二个卫星的二倍半左右，而且科学考察范围空前广泛，把国际地球物理年预订在高空进行的全部考察项目都装到它金属肚皮里了。
    在人造卫星这样一个最容易引起公众兴趣的尖端科学部门中，美国动员了特别巨大的力量来追赶苏联。陆海空军一齐出动，据已宣布的，正式发射了十四次结果成功了五次。五个卫星重量加在一起，才只是苏联第三个卫星重量的十四分之一左右。这些卫星有的是小如柚子，有的是寿命短到只有二十天。而且科学考察范围也比苏联卫星小得多。
    在1958年，美国还硬指望用中程火箭来发射“世界第一个”人造月球卫星。按照美国加利福尼亚理工学院火箭专家皮克临格博士的话说，美国是“还没有学会走路，就想跑步”。结果是四次发射都遭到了失败。到12月中旬，美国总算发射成了一个有效重量六十七点五公斤的卫星。这个卫星比苏联早在1957年10月发射的第一个卫星轻许多。
    与人造卫星相联系，在火箭技术发展水平方面，美国也远远落在苏联后面。苏联早在1957年8月即宣布制成洲际弹道火箭，并且用这种火箭发射了世界上第一个人造卫星。美国直到1958年11月底才宣称使一枚“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹飞完了全部射程。而在美国取得这一点进展的同时，苏联火箭技术已有了新的进展。1958年8月，苏联把载重一千六百九十公斤的单级火箭发射到四百五十公里高空。苏联发射的第三个卫星的重量几乎为它发射第一个卫星的十五倍。当美国宣传机构在为“阿特拉斯”导弹第一次达到洲际射程而大肆吹嘘的时候，美国著名火箭专家布劳恩宣布，他依然保持他原先的看法：“美国还需要五年的时间才能在火箭方面赶上苏联。”
    1958年9月，苏联建造的一座目前世界上最大的原子能发电站第一期工程已经完工并开始发电。这座发电站的总发电能力为六十万瓩，仅第一期工程发电能力即达十万瓩。美国的第一座原子能发电站——希平港原子能发电站直到1958年5月才正式投入生产。就是说，比苏联的第一座原子能发电站几乎迟了四年，而其发电能力还只有六万瓩。
    苏联建造的世界上第一艘原子能破冰船的三部原子反应堆都已安装完毕，在1958年10月开始了原地试车。这个破冰船具有极可靠的安全保护设备，即使离原子反应装置只三公尺，放射性强度仍不超过可忍受的水平。美国到目前为止还没有用于和平目的的交通运输工具。美国制造了原子能潜水艇，但还没有完全解决这种舰艇的安全问题。
    在对于深入探究原子核秘密方面有极重要意义的基本粒子加速器的建造方面，设于莫斯科附近的一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器，是目前世界上最大的加速器。此外，一座能量达五百亿电子伏特的加速器已经在列宁格勒电物理研究所制造。而美国正在赶紧制造中的一座加速器能量只及上述的一半。
    在可控制的热核反应方面，苏联在1958年夏天建成了著名的“奥格拉”装置，在日内瓦和平利用原子能展览会上展出了另一部已开始运转的“阿尔法”热核研究装置。利用这些装置就可以在原则上把实现稳定的热核反应问题提到日程上来。而美国在这方面更比苏联落后得多。
