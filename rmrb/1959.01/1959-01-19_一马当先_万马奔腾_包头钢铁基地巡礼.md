One Horse Takes the Lead, Ten Thousand Horses Gallop
——A Tour of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base
By Our Special Correspondent Xing Youzhen

The Baotou industrial base, centered around the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, is now leaping forward at an even faster pace.

The Baogang construction site, which was a wilderness only three years ago, now boasts towering buildings and interconnected factories under the Daqing and Wula Mountains. At night, the electric lights on the west bank of the Kundulun River twinkle like stars. On the wasteland at the end of the thirty-kilometer-long cement road—the Iron and Steel Avenue—leading from the old city to the Baogang construction site, a battle to change the historical face of the frontier is underway. China's largest Baogang No. 1 blast furnace, equipped with world-class advanced technology, has soared into the clouds, and workers are welding the furnace top high in the air. The Baogang large-scale steelmaking plant has already started construction. The construction of the largest mechanized mining operation has been basically completed, and a huge construction base and welfare area serving Baogang has been arranged. This year, Baogang's construction will present a glorious picture of the Great Leap Forward, contributing its strength in advance to the glorious task of 18 million tons of steel.

As the pioneering industry for Baogang's iron and steel production, Baotou's coal industry is also advancing by leaps and bounds. Take the train from Donghe District to the Shiguai coal mining area, travel more than thirty li, and ascend Weiqun Dam to enter the edge of the Shiguai coalfield. Standing on the top of the dam and looking forward, countless continuous mountain ranges stretch into the distance. Hidden in these crisscrossing mountain ranges are billions of tons of various types of coal, which can be mined for more than a hundred years by mines with an annual output of several million tons. This is one of Baogang's fuel bases, which has now been replaced by groups of buildings, replacing the desolation of the past. Everywhere there is the sound of marching towards the coalfield. A modern vertical shaft with an annual output of 600,000 tons and the expanded Zhaogou Pinghu Mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons of coal have been put into production one after another, and a large amount of coal is continuously transported to the Baogang construction site by train. Two modern vertical shafts with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal and a Baigouziguo mine with an annual output of 1.8 million to 3.6 million tons of coal are also under construction. The first large-scale washing plant directly serving Baogang will also start construction this year. During the Great Leap Forward, the heroic coal miners were full of energy. After several leaps forward, in 1958, the coal production was 1.3 million tons, exceeding the original plan by 4.4 times, greatly supporting Baogang and the city's iron and steelmaking campaign. The Great Leap Forward in Baogang's construction has further encouraged the workers building coal mines. The combat slogan they put forward is: "Fighting day and night, black gold rolls over, hands and feet are cold, confidence surpasses the volcano, complete the five-year plan in three years." It is estimated that by 1960, the annual output of raw coal in the Shiguai coalfield will reach 6 million tons.

In the early days of liberation, only seventeen street lights in the city emitted dim yellow light. Now, strong currents rush in all directions, and the lights are bright all night long. In recent years, in addition to expanding the original power plant, the power industry department in Baotou has also fully powered the huge and advanced Second Thermal Power Plant. The amount of electricity it generates can supply all the lighting electricity for a city with a population of 1.4 million. The automated First Thermal Power Plant, which is larger than the Second Thermal Power Plant, is under construction. Its tall water tower, chimney, and main plant have been erected next to Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace. In order to ensure the electricity consumption for Baogang's iron, steel, and steel production this year, the power department is doing everything possible to mobilize manpower and materials to support this thermal power plant despite the extremely tight equipment and building materials. When spring blossoms, this thermal power plant will be able to send strong currents to Baogang. In the near future, with these power plants as the center in Baotou, and connected with the Hohhot Power Plant, the first powerful power grid in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be formed. This power grid will strongly support Baogang, Bayan Obo Iron Mine, Shiguai Coal Mine, and the industrial and agricultural production construction of Baotou and Hohhot.

Around the construction of Baogang, the railway department has built many new railways in the Baotou area. From the time the Beijing-Baotou Railway was opened in 1922 to the liberation of Baotou in 1949, no new railway was built in the city. Now, the Baotou-Shiguai Coal Mine, the Baotou-Bayan Obo Iron Mine, the Baotou Ring Railway, and dedicated lines have all been opened to traffic, undertaking the heavy task of transporting building materials. A major artery connecting the Northwest and North China—the railway from Baotou to Yinchuan and Lanzhou—was also opened to traffic last year. The Baotou Railway Hub Station, composed of nine stations including the passenger terminal, freight marshalling station, and industrial liaison station, connecting Beijing-Baotou, Baotou-Lanzhou, Baotou-Bayan Obo, Baotou-Shiguai, and the Baotou Ring Road, began full-scale construction in May last year. Some stations have now been completed, and some stations are taking shape. On a five-kilometer-long station construction site in the Baotou Hub Station, thousands of road construction workers are working in the severe cold to build railway infrastructure. The iron, steel, and steel produced by Baogang can be continuously transported from here to all parts of the country to support socialist industrial and agricultural construction.

Baotou's local industry has also developed greatly in the past few years. Before liberation, Baotou only had some scattered and backward handicrafts and four small factories such as tap water, power generation, leather, and flour. Now, if you take a train from Beijing to Baotou, you will see factories passing by the window when you pass Dengkou and move forward. These are Baotou's local state-owned factories such as machinery, bricks and tiles, cement pipes, oxygen, and wood products. Large-scale aluminum plants, refractory sand plants, and cotton textile factories have already started construction. The future of Baotou's local industry is very beautiful.

Baotou's urban construction, commerce, culture, education, and health services have also developed rapidly under the impetus of Baogang. The population of Baotou has increased from nearly 100,000 in the early days of liberation to 700,000. A new urban area has been formed, with cement roads crossing the main streets of the city. Street lights have been installed on both sides of the newly built roads and in the streets and alleys of the city. A commercial network has been formed from Qingshan District to Kunlun District. Schools, hospitals, theaters…emerge on the streets like mushrooms after rain. People not only want to build Baotou into a huge industrial city, but also want to build it into a beautiful city. Baotou will be surrounded by a green belt.

The green mountains are like screens, and the Yellow River is like a belt. The steel city on the frontier—the Baotou heavy industrial base—is leaping forward at a rapid pace. The Mongolian people here are discussing: Our "Baoketu" (Mongolian for "place with deer") is about to become "Baolute Tai" (Mongolian for "place with steel").

    一马当先　万马奔腾
    ——包头钢铁基地巡礼
    本报特约记者　邢有祯
    以包头钢铁联合企业为中心的包头工业基地，现在正以更快的速度飞跃前进。
    包钢工地，在三年以前，还是一片荒野，现在大青山、乌拉山下，高楼林立，工厂连成一片。夜晚，昆都仑河西岸电灯闪烁，有如繁星。在由旧市区通向包钢工地的一条三十公里长的水泥大道——钢铁大街尽头的荒野上，进行着一场改变塞外历史面貌的战斗。用世界先进技术装备起来的我国最大的包钢一号高炉已耸入云霄，工人们正在高空焊接着炉顶。包钢大型炼钢厂已经开工兴建。规模最大的机械化采矿的矿山建设已经基本建成，为包钢服务的一个庞大的建筑基地和福利区已经安排就绪。包钢今年建设将呈现出一幅光辉的跃进图景，提前为一千八百万吨钢的光荣任务献出自己的力量。
    作为包钢钢铁生产的先行工业，包头煤炭工业也在突飞猛进。由东河区坐上到石拐煤矿区的火车，前进三十多里，上了魏群坝，便进入石拐煤田的边沿。站在坝顶向前眺望，无数连绵的山脉向远方伸展出去。就在这些纵横的山脉里，蕴藏着亿万吨种类奇多的煤炭，它可供年产几百万吨的矿井开采一百多年。这里是包钢的燃料基地之一，现在已经被一群群建筑物代替了往日的荒凉景象，到处是向煤田进军的声音。一座年产六十万吨的现代化竖井和扩建的年产三十万吨煤的召沟平湖矿，都已先后投入生产，大量的煤通过火车源源不断地运往包钢的建筑工地。两座年产六十万吨煤的现代化竖井和一座年产一百八十万到三百六十多万吨煤的白孤子沟矿井，也正在紧张地施工。直接为包钢服务的第一座规模巨大的洗选厂，在今年也开工兴建了。在大跃进中，英雄的煤矿工人干劲十足，经过几次跃进，1958年产煤一百三十万吨，超过原订计划的四点四倍，大大支援了包钢和全市的炼铁炼钢运动。包钢建设的大跃进，更加鼓舞了建设煤矿的工人，他们提出的战斗口号是：“昼夜奋战，黑金滚滚翻，手足虽冷，信心赛火山，五年计划三年完。”预计到1960年，石拐煤田年产原煤可达六百万吨。
    解放初期，全城只有十七盏路灯发出暗的黄光。现在，强大的电流奔向四方，灯光彻夜明。这几年，电力工业部门在包头除扩建了原有发电厂外，规模巨大、设备先进的第二热电厂已经全部发电。它发出来的电量，能供一个一百四十万人口的城市的全部照明用电。比第二热电厂更大的自动化的第一热电厂正在紧张施工，它的高大的水塔、烟囱、主厂房已矗立在包钢一号高炉旁边。为了保证今年包钢出铁出钢出钢材的用电，目前电业部门在设备和建筑材料极为紧张的情况下，千方百计地调动人力、物力支援这座热电厂。到春暖花开时，这座热电厂即可把强大的电流送到包钢。不久的将来，在包头以这几个发电厂为中心，和呼和浩特发电厂联结起来，就形成了内蒙古自治区的第一个强大的电力网。这个电力网将有力地支援包钢、白云鄂博铁矿、石拐煤矿和包头及呼和浩特等地的工农业生产建设。
    围绕包钢的建设，铁道部门在包头地区新建了不少铁路。从1922年京包铁路修通后，到1949年包头解放以前，全市再没新建一条铁路。现在，包头——石拐煤矿、包头——白云鄂博铁矿山的两条铁路及包头环城铁路、专用线已全线通车，担负起了繁重的建筑器材的运输任务。一条沟通大西北和华北的大动脉——包头至银川、兰州的铁路，也在去年通车。连结京包、包兰、包白、包石和包头环城路、由客运总站、货物编组站、工业联络站等九个车站组成的包头铁路枢纽站，从去年5月份全面动工兴建，现在有的车站已建成，有些车站已具雏形。在包头枢纽站的一个长五公里的车站工地上，数千筑路工人正冒着严寒施工，修建着一条条铁路基础工程。包钢生产的铁、钢、钢材就可从这里源源不断地运到全国各地，支援社会主义工农业建设。
    包头地方工业几年来也有很大发展。解放前的包头，仅有一些分散的落后的手工业和自来水、发电、皮革、面粉等四个小工厂。现在，如果你从北京乘火车到包头，在经过磴口向前行进的时候，就会看到一座座的工厂掠窗而过。这是包头市的机械、砖瓦、水泥管道、氧气、木器等地方国营工厂。规模较大的铝厂、耐火型砂厂、棉纺厂等已经动工兴建。包头地方工业的远景是十分美丽的。
    包头的城市建设和商业、文教卫生事业，也在包钢的带动下，有了飞跃的发展。包头市的人口已经从解放初的近十万人增长到七十万人。新的市区已经形成，一条条的水泥马路，穿过市区的大街。在新建的马路两边，在市区的大街小巷里，都装上了路灯。从青山区到昆仑区都已形成商业网。一座座学校、医院、影剧院……如同雨后春笋般出现在街头。人们不但要把包头建设成为一个巨大的工业城市，还要把它建设成为一个美丽的城市，包头的四周，将要被一条绿色的带子围了起来。
    青山似屏，黄河如带，塞上钢城——包头重工业基地正在一日千里地飞跃。这里的蒙古族人民议论：我们的“包克图”（蒙古语“有鹿的地方）要变成“包鲁特泰”（蒙古语“有钢的地方”）了。
