Conscientiously Study Marxist Dialectics
Sha Ying

In the documents of the Party, and in the works and talks of Comrade Mao Zedong, we have been repeatedly reminded to pay attention to studying Marxist dialectics. Our country is now in a great and extraordinary era. Since the rectification movement and the all-round Great Leap Forward, the liberated productive forces have been advancing rapidly, and many major changes have taken place in the relations of production (such as the universal establishment of people's communes, etc.). New creations and new problems are emerging one after another, and the struggle of various contradictions is changing rapidly, complicatedly, and tortuously. Under this situation, it is especially important to conscientiously study dialectics.

Marxist dialectics is "the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought" (Engels, "Anti-Dühring"). It is a great scientific weapon for understanding and transforming the world, and it can also be said to be an all-powerful "magic weapon." No matter what work is being done or what problem is being studied, this "magic weapon" is indispensable. As a revolutionary cadre, one must stand firmly on the position of the working class and have a dialectical way of thinking.

The opposite of dialectics is metaphysics. Lenin said: Dialectics is "the doctrine of development in its most complete, profound, and comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of human knowledge which provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter" ("Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism"). To observe problems with dialectics is to look at problems from a developmental and comprehensive point of view, so that we can stand tall, see far, be mentally agile, and feel comfortable, and avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality. In this way, it is easy to discover the interconnections and internal laws of objective things, find methods to solve problems, and be able to foresee the future and have a clear direction. The metaphysical method is to look at problems subjectively, statically, and one-sidedly. People who look at problems with this way of thinking are short-sighted, have rigid thinking, cannot grasp the essence of things, cannot find methods to solve problems, and are ignorant of new things. They lack foresight and often lose their way. We study dialectics to oppose metaphysics.

Learning Dialectics Requires Grasping Its Essence and Core

Dialectics has many laws and categories, but its most fundamental law is the law of contradiction of things, that is, the law of the unity of opposites. Lenin often referred to the law of contradiction of things as the essence of dialectics, and said: "Dialectics in the proper sense is the study of contradiction in the very essence of objects" (See "Abstract of Hegel's 'Science of Logic'"). Therefore, in studying dialectics, we must first grasp its essence and core. According to the law of contradiction of things, everything contains two aspects from beginning to end. These two aspects are contradictory, opposed to each other, and mutually exclusive; but these two aspects are also unified, that is, interconnected, mutually influential, and each is a condition for the existence of the other. It is because of this unity and struggle of opposites that the movement and change of things are caused. The internal contradictions and struggles of things are the driving force, source, and real content of the development of things. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "This dialectical world outlook teaches people in the main how to observe and analyse the movement of opposites in different things and, on the basis of such analysis, to indicate the methods for resolving contradictions."

The law of contradiction of things is the method that must be applied to study the development process of any thing. Comrade Mao Zedong often said in a simple and vivid way: We must walk on two legs, not on one or one and a half legs. This means that we should apply the law of contradiction of things. The policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous methods of production, which we have implemented in socialist construction, as well as the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward in industry, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with a large-scale mass movement, are all typical examples of walking on two legs, that is, applying the law of the unity of opposites. The rapid development of China's national economy in the past year, especially the fact that industrial and agricultural production has doubled, powerfully proves that these policies are correct, and also proves that the Party's application of dialectics is successful. If we did not walk on two legs, and did not have these simultaneous developments, our national economy would not have developed at such a high speed as it has now. For example, in political life, there is a political situation with both democracy and centralism, both freedom and discipline, both unified will and individual ease of mind, and liveliness; in cultural education, the combination of theory and practice, the combination of education and labor, the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism, and the combination of popularization and improvement, etc., are all correct applications of the law of the unity of opposites.

Comprehensive and Concrete Analysis of Problems is Required

When we engage in any specific work or handle any specific problem, we must look at the problem comprehensively, understand the characteristics of each side of the contradiction, and grasp the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, and strive to avoid one-sidedness. Comrade Mao Zedong has cited many vivid examples in "On Contradiction" and other works to illustrate the necessity of applying dialectics, especially the law of the unity of opposites. Now, people are not as mysterious about dialectics as they used to be. For example, the combination of abstract and concrete, using abstract to lead concrete; the combination of politics and profession, being both red and expert; despising difficulties strategically, and valuing difficulties tactically; breaking superstitions and respecting science; being both more, faster, and better, and more economical; having both advanced goals and concrete measures and methods; being both hard-working and clever; combining hard work and rest, combining labor and leisure, etc., these principles have become common sense. In fact, these are all unities of opposites, and these are the principles that must be followed in any specific work. When we deal with any specific problem, we always have to see both sides of the problem. "What is a problem? A problem is a contradiction in things. Where there is an unresolved contradiction, there is a problem." ("Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing") For example, when a debate arises when discussing a problem, there must be two or more opinions. What do you agree with and what do you oppose? This requires thinking, research, and analysis, and this requires the use of dialectics. Therefore, the so-called discussion of problems, distinguishing right from wrong, adjusting relations, formulating plans, determining proportions, etc., are all for the purpose of resolving contradictions, and all require the use of dialectics. At the same time, the two sides of the contradiction are not only jointly in a unity, but also transform into each other under certain conditions. The ancients in our country said: "Failure is the mother of success," "Good fortune lies within bad, and bad fortune lurks within good," "An old man on the frontier lost his mare; who could say it was not a blessing?" and "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, it seems there is no way out, but suddenly the willow trees are dark and the flowers are bright, and another village appears," all illustrate the principle that contradictions can transform into each other. That is how things are. Under certain conditions: difficulties can be transformed into smoothness, and smoothness can also be transformed into difficulties; advanced can be transformed into backward, and backward can also be transformed into advanced; failure can be transformed into success, and success can also be transformed into failure; good things can be transformed into bad things, and bad things can be transformed into good things. Whether we are engaged in revolution or construction, we must be promoters, not hinderers; we must strive to go upstream, not be content to stay downstream. Whether we are dealing with any problem or carrying out any work, we all hope to get a correct solution and become a victor, and we do not hope to make mistakes and become a loser. But to be a promoter, to strive to go upstream, and to become a victor, we must use dialectics to make our thoughts and actions conform to the laws of the objective world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the results they anticipate, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." ("On Practice") Our study and application of dialectics in actual work is for the purpose of promoting the transformation of things and achieving the goal of revolution. However, in actual work, some comrades often only see one side of the contradiction, and do not see the other side; only see the contradictory aspect of things, and do not see the unified aspect, or only see the unified aspect, and do not see the contradictory aspect; only see that the two sides of the contradiction are jointly in a unity, and do not see that the two sides can transform into each other under certain conditions, and this will naturally lead to mistakes.

The particularity and universality of contradictions, the individuality and commonality, the part and the whole, the tributaries and the main stream, the point and the surface, the tree and the forest, these are also the unity of opposites. Universality exists in particularity, commonality includes all individuality, many tributaries converge into the main stream, and many trees make up a forest. When we observe these problems, we should see the dialectical relationship between them. The process of human cognition is always from the particular to the general, and from the general to the particular, and so on in cycles, so that we can both understand the special essence of individual things and understand the common essence of things, so that human cognition can be gradually improved and deepened. In our actual work, especially when engaging in mass movements, we advocate dissecting sparrows, piloting, cultivating advanced models, and then summarizing typical experiences, using points to lead the surface, and promoting advanced experiences. We advocate that in our work, we should not only highlight key points, but also make comprehensive arrangements, not only take steel as the key link, but also achieve an overall leap forward, and not only take the lead, but also have all horses galloping, which is the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. We advocate that under the premise of the whole country as a chessboard, we should give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of various regions and departments; at the same time, we advocate that the minor premise should obey the major premise, and the part should obey the whole, which is also the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. We advocate that when looking at problems, we should first see the main stream, and not see the trees but not the forest; we should distinguish between the nine fingers and the one finger, and not attack one point without considering the rest; we should see the relationship between the line and policy issues and individual shortcomings, and not exaggerate individual shortcomings and not see the great achievements, which is also the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. However, some comrades often cannot grasp and apply this law, and always have a one-sided view when looking at problems, only seeing the tributaries and not the main stream, only seeing the trees and not the forest, only caring about the part and not the whole, or vice versa, and this will naturally lead to mistakes.

One Cannot Understand Marxism Without Understanding Dialectics

Everyone knows that Marxism-Leninism is the guide to all our actions, and studying Marxism is the fundamental condition for us to do our work well. However, one cannot understand Marxism without understanding dialectics. Because materialist dialectics is not only one of the components of Marxism, but also the foundation of Marxism, and the "soul of Marxism." The thoughts of all the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism are connected by the red line of dialectics. Similarly, all the works of Comrade Mao Zedong are also connected by the red line of dialectics. This also shows that in studying dialectics, we must conscientiously study the works of the classic writers. Any view that ignores the study of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism is wrong. We must not only study their works on materialist dialectics, but also study their other works. Lenin said in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" that we should "study the dialectics as actually applied by Marx in his 'Capital' and in his historical and political works." If we can carefully study the examples of the application of dialectics in the classic works, it will make us more deeply understand the essence of dialectics, and learn the ability to apply dialectics to specifically analyze problems. The complete works of Comrade Mao Zedong are a typical example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of China, and are a unity of high revolutionary spirit and high scientific spirit, and are the guidelines for solving the problems of the Chinese revolution and construction, which are particularly worthy of our serious study. We should not only conscientiously study his specialized philosophical works, but also conscientiously study how he applied dialectics in many of his works. For example, in his work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," he used dialectics to study the various contradictions in socialist society. He first divided the contradictions into two different types, pointed out the different methods for resolving the two types of contradictions, and then specifically analyzed the contradictions among the people, and based on this analysis, made principled arguments on a series of fundamental issues facing our country. This is a brilliant example of the creative application of dialectics. It should be pointed out now that we are still not doing enough in studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, let alone studying the art of Comrade Mao Zedong's application of dialectics.

One Cannot Implement the Party's Policies Without Understanding Dialectics

The Party's various policies are the guidelines that specifically guide the various activities of our country. They are all built on the basis of understanding objective laws, and they themselves are the embodiment of dialectics. If we do not understand dialectics, we cannot deeply understand the Party's policies, and of course it is impossible to implement them well. For example, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, large-character posters, and several simultaneous "parallel" policies are all vivid incarnations of dialectics. If we do not understand dialectics, we cannot understand it and implement it. For example, the recently announced "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes" not only expounds a series of issues related to the people's communes from a theoretical and policy perspective, but also is an example of the Party's application of dialectics to observe and analyze problems. For example, this resolution points out that we are both believers in continuous revolution and believers in the stages of revolutionary development; the socialist collective ownership system should gradually transition to the socialist ownership by the whole people, and the socialist society should gradually transition to the communist society; we must adhere to revolutionary enthusiasm and maintain a calm mind; we must give full play to human subjective initiative and respect objective laws; the development of production in the people's communes must be based on the unified national plan and adapted to local conditions; we must develop both self-sufficient production and commodity production; in the distribution of income, we will implement the principle of combining the wage system and the supply system; in production and life, we must grasp both production and life, and so on. These are all the crystallization of dialectics. If we conscientiously study this document, we can understand how the Party skillfully uses the "magic weapon" of dialectics.

We Must Learn Dialectics in Life and Work

Learning dialectics cannot stay in books and documents. Books and documents can only give us some knowledge and some inspiration, and serve as our guides; while dialectics is everywhere and at all times in life and work, so it is more important to learn it in life and work, and apply it. The problems encountered in life and work are often intricate, complex, and ever-changing. To correctly handle the problems encountered, we can only rely on specific analysis, and sometimes we need to personally experience it. Lenin said: The most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marx, lies in the concrete analysis of concrete situations (see "Communism"). Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If anyone wants to know something, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, by living (practicing) in the environment of that thing." ("On Practice") Only through practice and through specific analysis can we understand the internal laws of objective things and find specific ways to solve problems. When we understand the laws of objective things and find solutions, it is when we have successfully applied dialectics. Therefore, learning and applying dialectics in life and work is the most effective way. That is why the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often ask us to go to the masses, take a quick look, get off the horse and take a closer look, investigate and study, dissect sparrows, participate in labor, etc. In the past year or so, the people and cadres have created a series of new working methods in their actual work, such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, large-character posters, visits, exhibitions, evaluations, on-site meetings, planting experimental fields, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, deliberately setting up opposition, two participations, one reform, and three combinations, etc. These are all dialectical working methods and new developments in our Party's mass line. These experiences are valuable, and we should learn the art of applying dialectics from summarizing these experiences. Now that many cadres who have been sent to lower levels have returned, their thoughts and feelings have undergone major changes, their mass viewpoints have been strengthened, their thinking methods have become more flexible, and their working methods have been improved, which also shows how important it is to learn in practice and among the masses. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "We should respect the practice of the masses, respect the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses, and this is to respect materialism and respect dialectics."

Use the Weapon of Dialectics to Strive for a Greater Leap Forward

1959 is a decisive year in our three years of hard work. The tasks are very arduous and the problems are extremely complex, but we must achieve a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. All cadres and the people of the whole country must continue to muster soaring enthusiasm, oppose conservatism, break superstitions, emancipate their minds, further develop the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, and implement the policy of walking on two legs. These are the decisive factors for completing the task and continuing the Great Leap Forward. To this end, we are required to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, and especially pay attention to studying materialist dialectics. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we combine emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, combine breaking superstitions and respecting science, combine creativity and initiative with organization and discipline, and properly unify the two aspects in practice. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we establish a strong overall view, distinguish between major and minor, distinguish between urgency and importance, combine the part and the whole, and combine the national centralization and unity with local flexibility. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we understand the relationship between the individual and the state and the collective, and perfectly combine the three aspects, so that the interests of the individual are subordinate to the interests of the state and the collective, and the temporary interests are subordinate to the long-term interests. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we implement the working method of the mass line, promote the working style of leading cadres going deep into the masses and going deep into the front line, and make our leadership work more specific and more meticulous. Only in this way can we implement the Party's general line for building socialism, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, unite all forces that can be united, leap forward again and again, and achieve victory after victory.

Studying Marxist dialectics is not only urgently needed, but also completely possible. Dialectics is not something unattainable. Now that many workers and peasants across the country are already learning it, and after they have initially learned some basic philosophical knowledge, they can apply it, thereby improving their ideological awareness and promoting the development of production. As a cadre, one is more qualified to learn it, and must learn it even better. Of course, we cannot vulgarize and simplify the study of dialectics, thinking that as long as we remember a few rules, we can apply them everywhere. We must not think that learning dialectics is easy, thinking that we can get it without much effort; especially if we want to skillfully apply it, it is even more difficult. We must treat it seriously and conscientiously, and we must work hard. When it comes to the issue of studying philosophy, we must also despise difficulties strategically, make up our minds, and rely on our strong will, we will definitely be able to master it; but tactically, we must also value difficulties, be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and study diligently, so that we can achieve our goals.

In this infinitely magnificent era, let dialectics bloom with brilliant flowers and bear rich fruits everywhere in our motherland!

    认真学习马克思主义的辩证法
    沙英
    在党的文件里，在毛泽东同志的著作和谈话中，曾经多次地提醒我们要注意学习马克思主义的辩证法。我国现在正处于一个伟大的不平常的时代。自从整风运动和全面大跃进以来，解放了的生产力一日千里地前进，随之而来的在生产关系方面也有许多重大的变化（例如普遍建立了人民公社等等），新的创造，新的问题，层出不穷，各种矛盾的斗争，急剧变化，复杂曲折。在这种形势下面，认真学习辩证法就更加特别重要了。
    马克思主义的辩证法是“关于自然界、人类社会与思惟运动和发展的普遍规律”（恩格斯：“反杜林论”）。它是认识世界和改造世界的伟大的科学武器，也可以说它是一个万能的“法宝”。不论从事任何工作和研究任何问题，都离不开这个“法宝”。作为一个革命干部，必须站稳工人阶级的立场和具有辩证的思想方法。
    辩证法的对立面是形而上学。列宁说：辩证法乃是“最完整深刻而没有片面性弊病的发展学说”（“马克思主义的三个来源与三个组成部分”）。用辩证法来观察问题，就是从发展的全面的观点来看问题，使我们站得高，看得远，头脑活泼，心情舒畅，避免主观性、片面性和表面性。这样就容易发现客观事物的互相联系和内部规律，找到解决问题的方法，并且能预见未来，有明确的方向。形而上学的方法，就是主观地、静止地和片面地看问题。用这种思想方法看问题的人，鼠目寸光，思想僵化，抓不住事物的本质，找不到解决问题的方法，对新鲜事物懵然无知。缺乏预见性，经常迷失方向。我们学习辩证法，就是要反对形而上学。
    学习辩证法要抓住它的本质和核心
    辩证法有许多法则和范畴，但是它的最根本的法则是事物的矛盾法则，即对立统一的法则。列宁常称事物的矛盾法则为辩证法的本质，并说：“可以把辩证法简要地规定为关于对立统一的学说。这样一来，辩证法的核心就被抓住，……”（见“黑格尔‘逻辑学’一书摘要”）因此，我们研究辩证法，首先要抓着它的本质和核心。按照事物的矛盾法则看来，一切事物的内部自始至终都包含着两个方面，这两个方面是互相矛盾、互相对立和互相排斥的；但是这两个方面又是统一的，即互相联结，互相影响，并且互为自己存在的条件。正是由于这种对立面的统一和斗争，才引起事物的运动和变化。事物内部的矛盾和斗争是事物发展的动力、源泉和实在内容。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中说：“这个辩证法的宇宙观，主要地就是教导人们要善于去观察和分析各种事物的矛盾的运动，并根据这种分析，指出解决矛盾的方法。”
    事物矛盾的法则是研究任何事物的发展过程所必须应用的方法。毛泽东同志经常通俗而形象地说：我们要用两条腿走路，而不要用一条腿或者一条半腿走路。这就是要我们运用事物的矛盾法则的意思。我们在社会主义建设中所实行的工业和农业同时并举、重工业和轻工业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针，以及在工业中实行以钢为纲、全局跃进的方针，集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的方针，都是用两条腿走路即运用对立统一法则的典型的例子。一年来我国国民经济突飞猛进的发展，特别是工农业生产成倍增长的事实，有力地证明了这些方针是正确的，同时也证明了党运用辩证法是成功的。如果我们不是用两条腿走路，没有以上这些并举，我们的国民经济便不会有现在这样高速度的发展。再例如在政治生活方面的又有民主又有集中、又有自由又有纪律、又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面；在文化教育方面的理论和实践相结合、教育和劳动相结合、革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义相结合、普及和提高相结合等等方针，这也都是对立统一法则的正确运用。
    对问题要作全面的具体的分析
    我们从事任何具体工作或处理任何具体问题，都要全面地看问题，了解矛盾各方的特点，并抓住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面，力求避免片面性。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”等著作中曾经列举了许许多多生动的实例，来说明运用辩证法，特别是运用对立统一法则的必要性。现在，人们对于辩证法已不像过去那样神秘了，例如：务虚和务实相结合，以虚带实；政治和业务相结合，又红又专；在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难；既要破除迷信，又要尊重科学；既要多快，又要好省；既要有先进的奋斗目标，又要有具体的措施和办法；既要苦干又要巧干；苦战和休整相结合，劳和逸相结合，等等，这些道理已变成普通的常识了。其实，这都是对立的统一，这都是从事任何具体工作所必须遵守的原则。当我们处理任何一个具体问题的时候，我们总要看到问题的两个方面。“什么叫问题？问题就是事物的矛盾，那里有没有解决的矛盾，那里就有问题。”（“反对党八股”）例如当讨论一个问题发生争论的时候，必然存在着两个以上的意见，你赞成什么，反对什么呢？这就要动脑筋想一想，要加以研究和分析，这就要运用辩证法。因此，所谓讨论问题、分清是非、调整关系、制订计划、确定比例，等等，都是为的解决矛盾，都要运用辩证法。同时矛盾着的双方，不但共同处于一个统一体中，而且在一定条件下互相转化。我国古人说：“失败是成功之母”，“祸兮福所倚，福兮祸所伏”，“塞翁失马，安知非福”，“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，这都是说明矛盾可以互相转化的道理。事情就是这样，在一定的条件下面：困难可以转化为顺利，顺利也可以转化为困难；先进可以转化为落后，落后也可以转化为先进；失败可以转化为成功，成功可以转化为失败；好事可以转化为坏事，坏事可以转化为好事。不论搞革命和搞建设，我们都要做一个促进派，而不要做一个促退派；都要力争上游，不要甘居下游。不论处理任何问题或进行任何工作，我们都希望得到正确的解决，成为胜利者，而并不希望犯错误，成为失败者。但是要做促进派，要力争上游，要成为胜利者，都要运用辩证法，使自己的思想和行动合于客观外界的规律性。毛泽东同志说：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败”。（“实践论”）我们在实际工作中学习运用辩证法，就是为的促进事物的转化，达到革命的目的。可是在实际工作中，有些同志常常只看到矛盾的一方，而看不见另一方；只看见事物的矛盾方面，而看不见统一的方面，或者只看见统一的方面，而看不见矛盾的方面；只看见矛盾的双方共同处于一个统一体中，而看不见双方在一定的条件下面可以互相转化，这自然是要犯错误的。
    矛盾的特殊性和普遍性，个性和共性，局部和整体，支流和主流，点和面，树和林，这也是对立的统一。普遍性存在于特殊性之中，共性包括一切个性，许多支流汇成主流，许多树木集成森林。当我们观察这些问题时，应当看到它们之间的辩证关系。人的认识过程，总是由特殊到一般，由一般到特殊，如此循环往复地进行，才能既认识个别事物的特殊本质，又能认识事物的共同本质，从而使人的认识逐步提高和深化。我们在实际工作中，特别是搞群众运动时，主张解剖麻雀，试点，培养先进的典型，然后总结典型经验，以点带面，推广先进经验。我们主张在工作中既要突出重点，又要加以全面安排，既要以钢为纲，又要全面跃进，既要一马当先，又要万马奔腾，这就是正确运用对立统一的法则。我们主张在全国一盘棋的前提下，充分发挥各地区、各部门的机动性和积极性；同时我们主张小前提服从大前提，局部服从整体，这也是正确运用对立统一的法则。我们主张看问题，首先应看到主流，不要见树不见林；要分清九个指头和一个指头的关系，不要攻其一点不及其余；要看到路线、方针问题和个别缺点的关系，不要夸大个别的缺点而看不到伟大的成绩，这也是正确运用对立统一的法则。可是有些同志常常不能掌握和运用这个法则，在看问题时总带有片面性，只见支流不见主流，只见树木不见森林，只顾局部不顾整体，或者与此相反，这自然是要犯错误的。
    不懂得辩证法就不懂得马克思主义
    大家都知道，马克思列宁主义是我们一切行动的指南，学习马克思主义是我们做好工作的根本条件。但是，不懂得辩证法，就不可能懂得马克思主义。因为唯物辩证法不仅是马克思主义的组成部分之一，而且是马克思主义的基础，是“马克思主义的灵魂”。马克思列宁主义的经典作家们的全部著作的思想，都是用辩证法这条红线贯串起来的。同样地，毛泽东同志的全部著作，也都贯串着辩证法这条红线。由此也就说明了，学习辩证法，要认真学习经典作家们的著作。任何忽视学习马克思列宁主义经典著作的观点都是错误的。我们不但要学习他们有关唯物辩证法的著作，而且要学习他们的其他著作。列宁在“论战斗唯物主义的意义”一文中说，我们要“研究马克思在他所写的‘资本论’中及各种历史和政治著作中实际运用的辩证法”。如果我们能对经典著作中运用辩证法的范例加以精心地研究，就会使我们更深刻地体会到辩证法的实质，并学到应用辩证法来具体分析问题的本领。毛泽东同志的全部著作，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国具体实践相结合的典型，是高度革命性和高度科学性的统一，是解决中国革命问题和建设问题的指针，特别值得我们认真地学习。我们不仅要认真学习他的专门的哲学著作，而且要认真学习他在许多著作中是怎样运用辩证法的。例如他在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一著作中，运用辩证法研究了社会主义社会中的各种矛盾问题，他首先划分了两类不同性质的矛盾，指出了解决两类矛盾的不同的方法，接着特别突出地分析了人民内部的矛盾问题，并根据这种分析对我国所面临的一系列的根本问题作了原则性的论证。这是创造性地运用辩证法的光辉范例。现在应当指出，我们在学习毛泽东同志的著作这方面还是很不够的，至于说到学习毛泽东同志运用辩证法的艺术，那更是不够的。
    不懂辩证法就不能贯彻执行党的方针政策
    党的各种方针政策，是具体指导我们国家各种活动的准绳。它们都是建筑在对于客观规律的认识的基础之上的，它们本身就是辩证法的体现。如果我们不懂得辩证法，便不能深刻理解党的方针政策，当然也就不可能很好的贯彻执行它。例如“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“长期共存、互相监督”，大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报，以及几个同时“并举”的方针，都是活生生的辩证法的化身，如果我们不懂得辩证法，那便不可能理解它和贯彻执行它。再例如最近公布的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，它不仅从理论上和政策上阐述了有关人民公社的一系列的问题，而且是党运用辩证法观察和分析问题的范例。例如这个决议指出：我们既是不断革命论者，又是革命发展的阶段论者；社会主义的集体所有制要逐步过渡到社会主义的全民所有制，社会主义社会要逐步过渡到共产主义社会；既要坚持革命热情，又要坚持冷静的头脑；既要充分发挥人的主观能动性，又要尊重客观的规律性；人民公社发展生产既要根据国家统一计划，又要因地制宜；既要发展自给性生产，又要发展商品性生产；在分配问题上则实行工资制和供给制相结合的原则，在生产和生活方面，既要抓生产又要抓生活，等等。这都是辩证法的结晶。我们如果认真学习这个文件，就能从中体会到党是怎样巧妙地运用辩证法这个“法宝”的。
    要到生活中和工作中去学习辩证法
    学习辩证法不能停留在书本和文件上，书本和文件只能给我们一些知识，一些启示，作为我们的向导；而辩证法在生活中、工作中是无处不在、无时不在的，因此更重要的是要在生活中和工作中学习它，并应用它。在生活中和工作中所遇到的问题，往往是错综复杂、千变万化的，要想正确地处理所遇到的问题，只有依靠具体分析，有时还需要亲身体验。列宁说：马克思主义最本质的东西，马克思的活的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体的情况（见“共产主义”一文）毛泽东同志说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”（“实践论”）只有经过实践，经过具体分析，才能认识客观事物的内部规律，找到解决问题的具体办法。当我们认识了客观事物的规律性而找到了解决办法的时候，也就是我们运用辩证法得到成功的时候。因此，在生活中和工作中学习运用辩证法，是最有效的办法。党和毛泽东同志所以经常要我们到群众中去，走马观花，下马观花，调查研究，解剖麻雀，参加劳动，等等，就是这个道理。一年多以来，人民群众和干部在实际工作中创造了一系列新的工作方法，例如大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报、参观、展览、评比、现场会议、种试验田、抓两头带中间、有意树立对立面、两参一改三结合，等等，这都是辩证法的工作方法，也是我们党的群众路线的新发展。这些经验是宝贵的，我们应当从总结这些经验中学习运用辩证法的艺术。现在许多下放干部回来以后，思想感情发生了重大的变化，群众观点增强了，思想方法灵活了，工作方法改进了，这也说明到实际中、到群众中去学习是多么重要。刘少奇同志在八大第二次会议的政治报告中说：“我们应当尊重群众的实践，尊重群众的革命性和创造性，这才是尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法。”
    运用辩证法的武器，争取更大的跃进
    1959年，是我们苦战三年中具有决定性的一年，任务十分艰巨，问题异常复杂，但是我们要在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现一个更大、更好和更全面的大跃进。全体干部和全国人民，都要继续鼓足冲天的干劲，反对保守，破除迷信，解放思想，进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针。这是完成任务和继续大跃进的决定性的因素。为此，就要求我们认真学习马克思列宁主义，特别要注意学习唯物辩证法。只有学会运用辩证法，才能把解放思想和实事求是相结合，把破除迷信和尊重科学相结合，把创造性、积极性和组织性、纪律性相结合，并在实践中把两方面妥善地统一起来。只有学会运用辩证法，才能树立坚强的全局观点，分清主要次要，分清轻重缓急，把局部和整体结合起来，把全国的集中统一和地方的机动结合起来。只有学会运用辩证法，才能认识个人和国家、集体的关系，并把三方面完善地结合起来，使个人的利益服从国家和集体的利益，使暂时的利益服从长远的利益。只有学会运用辩证法，才能贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，发扬领导干部深入群众、深入现场的工作作风，使我们的领导工作更加具体，更加细致。只有这样，我们才能贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，调动一切可以调动的积极因素，团结一切可以团结的力量，跃进再跃进，胜利接着胜利。
    学习马克思主义辩证法不仅是迫切需要的，而且是完全可能的。辩证法并不是什么高不可攀的东西。现在全国既然已有许多工人农民都在学习它了，而且他们在初步学习了一些哲学常识之后，便能运用它，从而提高了思想觉悟，推动了生产的发展。作为一个干部，那是更有条件学习的，而且一定要学习得更好一些。当然，我们也不能把学习辩证法庸俗化和简单化，以为只要记着几条法则，便可到处去乱套。我们也不要把学习辩证法看得是轻而易举的，认为不要用多大力气，就可垂手而得；特别是要想熟练地运用它，那是更不大容易的。我们要严肃认真地对待它，要下苦工夫。对待学习哲学这个问题，我们也要在战略上藐视困难，下定决心，依靠我们坚强的意志，一定可以掌握它；但在战术上我们也要重视困难，虚心谨慎，戒骄戒躁，刻苦钻研，这样才能达到我们的目的。
    在这个无限壮丽的时代里，让辩证法在我们祖国的大地上到处开满绚烂的花朵，结出丰硕的果实！
