Conscientiously Study Marxist Dialectics
Sha Ying

In the documents of the Party, and in the works and talks of Comrade Mao Zedong, we have been repeatedly reminded to pay attention to studying Marxist dialectics. Our country is now in a great and extraordinary era. Since the rectification movement and the all-round Great Leap Forward, the liberated productive forces have been advancing rapidly, and many major changes have taken place in the relations of production (such as the universal establishment of people's communes, etc.). New creations and new problems are emerging one after another, and the struggle of various contradictions is changing rapidly, complicatedly, and tortuously. Under this situation, it is especially important to conscientiously study dialectics.

Marxist dialectics is "the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought" (Engels, "Anti-DÃ¼hring"). It is a great scientific weapon for understanding and transforming the world, and it can also be said to be an all-powerful "magic weapon." No matter what work is being done or what problem is being studied, this "magic weapon" is indispensable. As a revolutionary cadre, one must stand firmly on the position of the working class and have a dialectical way of thinking.

The opposite of dialectics is metaphysics. Lenin said: Dialectics is "the doctrine of development in its most complete, profound, and comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of human knowledge which provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter" ("Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism"). To observe problems with dialectics is to look at problems from a developmental and comprehensive point of view, so that we can stand tall, see far, be mentally agile, and feel comfortable, and avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality. In this way, it is easy to discover the interconnections and internal laws of objective things, find methods to solve problems, and be able to foresee the future and have a clear direction. The metaphysical method is to look at problems subjectively, statically, and one-sidedly. People who look at problems with this way of thinking are short-sighted, have rigid thinking, cannot grasp the essence of things, cannot find methods to solve problems, and are ignorant of new things. They lack foresight and often lose their way. We study dialectics to oppose metaphysics.

Learning Dialectics Requires Grasping Its Essence and Core

Dialectics has many laws and categories, but its most fundamental law is the law of contradiction of things, that is, the law of the unity of opposites. Lenin often referred to the law of contradiction of things as the essence of dialectics, and said: "Dialectics in the proper sense is the study of contradiction in the very essence of objects" (See "Abstract of Hegel's 'Science of Logic'"). Therefore, in studying dialectics, we must first grasp its essence and core. According to the law of contradiction of things, everything contains two aspects from beginning to end. These two aspects are contradictory, opposed to each other, and mutually exclusive; but these two aspects are also unified, that is, interconnected, mutually influential, and each is a condition for the existence of the other. It is because of this unity and struggle of opposites that the movement and change of things are caused. The internal contradictions and struggles of things are the driving force, source, and real content of the development of things. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": "This dialectical world outlook teaches people in the main how to observe and analyse the movement of opposites in different things and, on the basis of such analysis, to indicate the methods for resolving contradictions."

The law of contradiction of things is the method that must be applied to study the development process of any thing. Comrade Mao Zedong often said in a simple and vivid way: We must walk on two legs, not on one or one and a half legs. This means that we should apply the law of contradiction of things. The policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry, simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously developing foreign and indigenous methods of production, which we have implemented in socialist construction, as well as the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving an overall leap forward in industry, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with a large-scale mass movement, are all typical examples of walking on two legs, that is, applying the law of the unity of opposites. The rapid development of China's national economy in the past year, especially the fact that industrial and agricultural production has doubled, powerfully proves that these policies are correct, and also proves that the Party's application of dialectics is successful. If we did not walk on two legs, and did not have these simultaneous developments, our national economy would not have developed at such a high speed as it has now. For example, in political life, there is a political situation with both democracy and centralism, both freedom and discipline, both unified will and individual ease of mind, and liveliness; in cultural education, the combination of theory and practice, the combination of education and labor, the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism, and the combination of popularization and improvement, etc., are all correct applications of the law of the unity of opposites.

Comprehensive and Concrete Analysis of Problems is Required

When we engage in any specific work or handle any specific problem, we must look at the problem comprehensively, understand the characteristics of each side of the contradiction, and grasp the main contradiction and the main aspect of the contradiction, and strive to avoid one-sidedness. Comrade Mao Zedong has cited many vivid examples in "On Contradiction" and other works to illustrate the necessity of applying dialectics, especially the law of the unity of opposites. Now, people are not as mysterious about dialectics as they used to be. For example, the combination of abstract and concrete, using abstract to lead concrete; the combination of politics and profession, being both red and expert; despising difficulties strategically, and valuing difficulties tactically; breaking superstitions and respecting science; being both more, faster, and better, and more economical; having both advanced goals and concrete measures and methods; being both hard-working and clever; combining hard work and rest, combining labor and leisure, etc., these principles have become common sense. In fact, these are all unities of opposites, and these are the principles that must be followed in any specific work. When we deal with any specific problem, we always have to see both sides of the problem. "What is a problem? A problem is a contradiction in things. Where there is an unresolved contradiction, there is a problem." ("Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing") For example, when a debate arises when discussing a problem, there must be two or more opinions. What do you agree with and what do you oppose? This requires thinking, research, and analysis, and this requires the use of dialectics. Therefore, the so-called discussion of problems, distinguishing right from wrong, adjusting relations, formulating plans, determining proportions, etc., are all for the purpose of resolving contradictions, and all require the use of dialectics. At the same time, the two sides of the contradiction are not only jointly in a unity, but also transform into each other under certain conditions. The ancients in our country said: "Failure is the mother of success," "Good fortune lies within bad, and bad fortune lurks within good," "An old man on the frontier lost his mare; who could say it was not a blessing?" and "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, it seems there is no way out, but suddenly the willow trees are dark and the flowers are bright, and another village appears," all illustrate the principle that contradictions can transform into each other. That is how things are. Under certain conditions: difficulties can be transformed into smoothness, and smoothness can also be transformed into difficulties; advanced can be transformed into backward, and backward can also be transformed into advanced; failure can be transformed into success, and success can also be transformed into failure; good things can be transformed into bad things, and bad things can be transformed into good things. Whether we are engaged in revolution or construction, we must be promoters, not hinderers; we must strive to go upstream, not be content to stay downstream. Whether we are dealing with any problem or carrying out any work, we all hope to get a correct solution and become a victor, and we do not hope to make mistakes and become a loser. But to be a promoter, to strive to go upstream, and to become a victor, we must use dialectics to make our thoughts and actions conform to the laws of the objective world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the results they anticipate, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." ("On Practice") Our study and application of dialectics in actual work is for the purpose of promoting the transformation of things and achieving the goal of revolution. However, in actual work, some comrades often only see one side of the contradiction, and do not see the other side; only see the contradictory aspect of things, and do not see the unified aspect, or only see the unified aspect, and do not see the contradictory aspect; only see that the two sides of the contradiction are jointly in a unity, and do not see that the two sides can transform into each other under certain conditions, and this will naturally lead to mistakes.

The particularity and universality of contradictions, the individuality and commonality, the part and the whole, the tributaries and the main stream, the point and the surface, the tree and the forest, these are also the unity of opposites. Universality exists in particularity, commonality includes all individuality, many tributaries converge into the main stream, and many trees make up a forest. When we observe these problems, we should see the dialectical relationship between them. The process of human cognition is always from the particular to the general, and from the general to the particular, and so on in cycles, so that we can both understand the special essence of individual things and understand the common essence of things, so that human cognition can be gradually improved and deepened. In our actual work, especially when engaging in mass movements, we advocate dissecting sparrows, piloting, cultivating advanced models, and then summarizing typical experiences, using points to lead the surface, and promoting advanced experiences. We advocate that in our work, we should not only highlight key points, but also make comprehensive arrangements, not only take steel as the key link, but also achieve an overall leap forward, and not only take the lead, but also have all horses galloping, which is the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. We advocate that under the premise of the whole country as a chessboard, we should give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of various regions and departments; at the same time, we advocate that the minor premise should obey the major premise, and the part should obey the whole, which is also the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. We advocate that when looking at problems, we should first see the main stream, and not see the trees but not the forest; we should distinguish between the nine fingers and the one finger, and not attack one point without considering the rest; we should see the relationship between the line and policy issues and individual shortcomings, and not exaggerate individual shortcomings and not see the great achievements, which is also the correct application of the law of the unity of opposites. However, some comrades often cannot grasp and apply this law, and always have a one-sided view when looking at problems, only seeing the tributaries and not the main stream, only seeing the trees and not the forest, only caring about the part and not the whole, or vice versa, and this will naturally lead to mistakes.

One Cannot Understand Marxism Without Understanding Dialectics

Everyone knows that Marxism-Leninism is the guide to all our actions, and studying Marxism is the fundamental condition for us to do our work well. However, one cannot understand Marxism without understanding dialectics. Because materialist dialectics is not only one of the components of Marxism, but also the foundation of Marxism, and the "soul of Marxism." The thoughts of all the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism are connected by the red line of dialectics. Similarly, all the works of Comrade Mao Zedong are also connected by the red line of dialectics. This also shows that in studying dialectics, we must conscientiously study the works of the classic writers. Any view that ignores the study of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism is wrong. We must not only study their works on materialist dialectics, but also study their other works. Lenin said in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism" that we should "study the dialectics as actually applied by Marx in his 'Capital' and in his historical and political works." If we can carefully study the examples of the application of dialectics in the classic works, it will make us more deeply understand the essence of dialectics, and learn the ability to apply dialectics to specifically analyze problems. The complete works of Comrade Mao Zedong are a typical example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of China, and are a unity of high revolutionary spirit and high scientific spirit, and are the guidelines for solving the problems of the Chinese revolution and construction, which are particularly worthy of our serious study. We should not only conscientiously study his specialized philosophical works, but also conscientiously study how he applied dialectics in many of his works. For example, in his work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," he used dialectics to study the various contradictions in socialist society. He first divided the contradictions into two different types, pointed out the different methods for resolving the two types of contradictions, and then specifically analyzed the contradictions among the people, and based on this analysis, made principled arguments on a series of fundamental issues facing our country. This is a brilliant example of the creative application of dialectics. It should be pointed out now that we are still not doing enough in studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, let alone studying the art of Comrade Mao Zedong's application of dialectics.

One Cannot Implement the Party's Policies Without Understanding Dialectics

The Party's various policies are the guidelines that specifically guide the various activities of our country. They are all built on the basis of understanding objective laws, and they themselves are the embodiment of dialectics. If we do not understand dialectics, we cannot deeply understand the Party's policies, and of course it is impossible to implement them well. For example, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," "Long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, large-character posters, and several simultaneous "parallel" policies are all vivid incarnations of dialectics. If we do not understand dialectics, we cannot understand it and implement it. For example, the recently announced "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes" not only expounds a series of issues related to the people's communes from a theoretical and policy perspective, but also is an example of the Party's application of dialectics to observe and analyze problems. For example, this resolution points out that we are both believers in continuous revolution and believers in the stages of revolutionary development; the socialist collective ownership system should gradually transition to the socialist ownership by the whole people, and the socialist society should gradually transition to the communist society; we must adhere to revolutionary enthusiasm and maintain a calm mind; we must give full play to human subjective initiative and respect objective laws; the development of production in the people's communes must be based on the unified national plan and adapted to local conditions; we must develop both self-sufficient production and commodity production; in the distribution of income, we will implement the principle of combining the wage system and the supply system; in production and life, we must grasp both production and life, and so on. These are all the crystallization of dialectics. If we conscientiously study this document, we can understand how the Party skillfully uses the "magic weapon" of dialectics.

We Must Learn Dialectics in Life and Work

Learning dialectics cannot stay in books and documents. Books and documents can only give us some knowledge and some inspiration, and serve as our guides; while dialectics is everywhere and at all times in life and work, so it is more important to learn it in life and work, and apply it. The problems encountered in life and work are often intricate, complex, and ever-changing. To correctly handle the problems encountered, we can only rely on specific analysis, and sometimes we need to personally experience it. Lenin said: The most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marx, lies in the concrete analysis of concrete situations (see "Communism"). Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If anyone wants to know something, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, by living (practicing) in the environment of that thing." ("On Practice") Only through practice and through specific analysis can we understand the internal laws of objective things and find specific ways to solve problems. When we understand the laws of objective things and find solutions, it is when we have successfully applied dialectics. Therefore, learning and applying dialectics in life and work is the most effective way. That is why the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often ask us to go to the masses, take a quick look, get off the horse and take a closer look, investigate and study, dissect sparrows, participate in labor, etc. In the past year or so, the people and cadres have created a series of new working methods in their actual work, such as large-scale airing of views, large-scale debate, large-character posters, visits, exhibitions, evaluations, on-site meetings, planting experimental fields, grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, deliberately setting up opposition, two participations, one reform, and three combinations, etc. These are all dialectical working methods and new developments in our Party's mass line. These experiences are valuable, and we should learn the art of applying dialectics from summarizing these experiences. Now that many cadres who have been sent to lower levels have returned, their thoughts and feelings have undergone major changes, their mass viewpoints have been strengthened, their thinking methods have become more flexible, and their working methods have been improved, which also shows how important it is to learn in practice and among the masses. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress: "We should respect the practice of the masses, respect the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses, and this is to respect materialism and respect dialectics."

Use the Weapon of Dialectics to Strive for a Greater Leap Forward

1959 is a decisive year in our three years of hard work. The tasks are very arduous and the problems are extremely complex, but we must achieve a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. All cadres and the people of the whole country must continue to muster soaring enthusiasm, oppose conservatism, break superstitions, emancipate their minds, further develop the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, strengthen the Party's leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, and implement the policy of walking on two legs. These are the decisive factors for completing the task and continuing the Great Leap Forward. To this end, we are required to conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, and especially pay attention to studying materialist dialectics. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we combine emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, combine breaking superstitions and respecting science, combine creativity and initiative with organization and discipline, and properly unify the two aspects in practice. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we establish a strong overall view, distinguish between major and minor, distinguish between urgency and importance, combine the part and the whole, and combine the national centralization and unity with local flexibility. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we understand the relationship between the individual and the state and the collective, and perfectly combine the three aspects, so that the interests of the individual are subordinate to the interests of the state and the collective, and the temporary interests are subordinate to the long-term interests. Only by learning to apply dialectics can we implement the working method of the mass line, promote the working style of leading cadres going deep into the masses and going deep into the front line, and make our leadership work more specific and more meticulous. Only in this way can we implement the Party's general line for building socialism, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized, unite all forces that can be united, leap forward again and again, and achieve victory after victory.

Studying Marxist dialectics is not only urgently needed, but also completely possible. Dialectics is not something unattainable. Now that many workers and peasants across the country are already learning it, and after they have initially learned some basic philosophical knowledge, they can apply it, thereby improving their ideological awareness and promoting the development of production. As a cadre, one is more qualified to learn it, and must learn it even better. Of course, we cannot vulgarize and simplify the study of dialectics, thinking that as long as we remember a few rules, we can apply them everywhere. We must not think that learning dialectics is easy, thinking that we can get it without much effort; especially if we want to skillfully apply it, it is even more difficult. We must treat it seriously and conscientiously, and we must work hard. When it comes to the issue of studying philosophy, we must also despise difficulties strategically, make up our minds, and rely on our strong will, we will definitely be able to master it; but tactically, we must also value difficulties, be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and study diligently, so that we can achieve our goals.

In this infinitely magnificent era, let dialectics bloom with brilliant flowers and bear rich fruits everywhere in our motherland!
