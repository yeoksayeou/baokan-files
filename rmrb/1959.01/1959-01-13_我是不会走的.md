Title: I Won't Leave

These past few days, we've been constantly immersed in a mood of reluctant farewell. Due to work needs, some of the comrades who came down to this place with us have been transferred back to the offices. Whenever we have late-night talks before departures, whenever we shake hands to say goodbye as they board the train, we all share a common aspiration that spurs us on: "To undergo even more arduous training!"

Now, everyone's feelings are pretty much the same. That is, we're very afraid of suddenly receiving a notice at any moment, forcing us to reluctantly part with our second hometown that we're unwilling to leave. Speaking from the heart, we truly hope to live in the countryside for a few more years. If the organization allows us to take root in the commune, allows us to settle down in the countryside for good, and forever be builders of a socialist countryside, that would be a dream come true.

It feels like only ten days have passed since we came down here ten months ago. The leader's speech and the deafening sounds of gongs and drums at the farewell rally still seem to echo in my ears. The warm hospitality of the villagers when we settled in and the joyful scenes of the first day of labor are still fresh in my memory. I have deeply fallen in love with the countryside. The deep affection of the villagers is beyond description. Auntie's love for me is no less than my own mother's, and my closeness with Brother A'di surpasses even that with my own biological brother. When we first settled down, the villagers addressed me as "Comrade Zhu," then "Old Zhu," and later, they called me "Xiuyi" affectionately, as if I were their own son or brother.

The villagers guided me every step of the way. I have initially learned nearly thirty kinds of farm work, such as transplanting rice seedlings, harvesting rice, plowing, harrowing, and raking the fields. I went from "unable to carry a burden on my shoulders" to carrying over a hundred catties of surplus grain on my shoulders, striding briskly in the transportation team to the market town five miles away. I went from "mistaking wheat seedlings for chives" to being able to distinguish the crops planted in the fields from afar. But I am not satisfied at all. I have "钻进去 (zuan jin qu: drilled into/immersed myself)" agriculture, but I haven't "爬出来 (pa chu lai: climbed out/mastered the basics)," let alone become "专 (zhuan: specialized)" and "专深 (zhuan shen: deeply specialized)."

As for "红 (hong: Red/Ideologically sound)," I can only say I have started to become "红 (hong: Red/Ideologically sound)," and there is still a long way to go before becoming fully "红 (hong: Red/Ideologically sound)" and "红透 (hong tou: Red through and through/Completely Ideologically sound)." Therefore, if I don't undergo further arduous training, I would be letting down the Party's concern.

The task the Party has given us is to "train ourselves and promote the great leap forward in agriculture and the cultural great change." Therefore, under the leadership of the general branch secretary, our twenty-odd down-to-the-countryside comrades have started a blackboard newspaper, a commune newspaper, a people's school, and an agricultural junior high school. We have assisted the commune leader in abolishing the nightly scoring system and implementing "田头清 (tian tou qing: Field clearing/On-the-spot settlement)" during breaks in the fields, saving the lamp oil and time used for scoring work points for the farmer brothers to study. Things have become even better after the establishment of the commune. We have established high school classes, a commune hospital, a health clinic, and expanded and established clubs. After gaining access to cultural and recreational activities, the farmers have become even more motivated and their labor efficiency is very high. I am doing pharmaceutical work, and now I have learned to be a "多面手 (duo mian shou: all-rounder)," cautiously diagnosing, injecting, bandaging, and changing dressings for the villagers. I have successively treated more than sixty people with influenza, measles, malaria, dysentery, boils, and external injuries, and have also trained several health workers.

Seeing that some comrades have been transferred back, the villagers fear that I will not stay either. Auntie was so worried that she didn't eat a full meal for two meals. I sincerely told her and answered every hardworking, kind, and affectionate farmer friend who asked me "when are you going back": "Please rest assured, I will not leave—I have written to the leading organs, asking the organization to allow me to stay here forever."

    我是不会走的
    浙江金华　朱修毅
    这几天，我们这里经常在一种依依惜别的情绪中。由于工作的需要，我们一起下放到这儿来的同志，有几个已调回机关去了。每当临别夜谈的时候，每当送他们上车握手告别的时候，都有一个共同的心愿鞭策着自己：“要更艰苦的锻炼！”
    现在，我们每个人的心情都差不多。这就是很怕在什么时候接到一个突如其来的通知，不得不惜别我们所不愿离开的第二家乡。说肺腑话，我们真希望能在农村多住几年，如果组织允许我们在公社里扎根，允许我们就此在农村里安家落户，永远做个社会主义农村的建设者，那是梦寐以求的。
    下放十个月了，仿佛只有十天。欢送大会上的首长讲话和喧天的锣鼓声好像还在耳边，落户时乡亲们的热情招待和第一个劳动日的欢乐情景记忆犹新。我已经深深的爱上了农村了；乡亲们的深情厚谊，更是非笔墨所能形容。姆妈对我的爱同妈妈不分上下，我和阿弟的亲热超过了对自己的同胞弟弟。刚落户的时候乡亲们称呼我“朱同志”，后来叫“老朱”，再后来就像待儿子、兄弟似的亲切地叫“修毅”了。
    乡亲们把着手教我，我初步学会了插秧、割稻、耕、耙、耖田等近三十种农活，从“肩不能挑担”到挑着一百多斤余粮夹在运输大队中健步送往五里远的集镇，从“麦苗当韭菜”到远远就能辨清田里种的是什么作物。但我毫不满足，我对农业是“钻进去”了，还没有“爬出来”，更谈不上“专”和“专深”；
  “红”呢？只能说开始“红”，离
  “红”和“红透”距离还远，因此，若不进一步的艰苦锻炼，那是对不起党的关注的。
    党交给我们的任务是“锻炼自己，促进农业大跃进和文化大翻身。”因而，我们二十几个下放同志在总支书记的领导下，办起了黑板报、社报、民校和农业初中，协助社长革除每晚评分制，实行田间歇力时的“田头清”，把评记工分的灯油和时间省下来给农民兄弟读书。公社成立后更好了，办起了高中班，社医院，保健室，扩大和增办了俱乐部。农民得到学文化和文娱生活后，干劲更足了，劳动效率很高。我是做药剂工作的，现在我学当了“多面手”，谨慎地替乡亲们诊病、注射、包扎、换药，先后治愈了流感、麻疹、疟疾、痢疾、脓疮和外伤等六十多人，还培养了好几个保健员。
    乡亲们看见有几个同志调回了，怕我也留不住，姆妈担忧得两餐没吃饱饭，我诚恳地告诉她和回答问我“几时回去”的每一个勤劳、善良而多情的农友：“请放心，我是不会走的——我已写信给领导机关，要求组织让我永远留在这里了。”
