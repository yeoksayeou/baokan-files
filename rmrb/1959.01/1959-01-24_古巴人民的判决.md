    The Verdict of the Cuban People
    Xia Ren
    One million Cubans held an angry rally in Havana. How exciting! This is no ordinary demonstration; it is a demonstration against a powerful and vicious imperialism right at its doorstep. This heroic and resolute spirit is particularly admirable.
    Look at this inspiring scene: when Castro asked the people, "All those who demand the punishment of the executioners, please raise your hands," "a chorus of voices rang out in the square, and tens of millions of hands were raised as one." This is an expression of the people's will, this is the people's verdict, but this verdict is not only for a small group of murderous executioners, but for a powerful and vicious imperialism; the Cuban people have declared the utter defeat of its colonial policy. The true will of the Cuban people is to thoroughly eliminate the forces of imperialism in Cuba.
    Whoever dares to fight imperialism is the most heroic and the most glorious. This is not limited by region or ethnicity. Some have already set an example. Last year, the Iraqi people set an example, and this year, the Cuban people have set an example again. People all over the world will strive for this glory, and the people's verdict will eventually be executed.

    古巴人民的判决
    侠人
    一百万古巴人，在哈瓦那愤怒集会示威，这是多么激动人心的事啊！这不是普通的示威，是在一个强大凶恶的帝国主义的门前，向这个强大凶恶的帝国主义的示威，这英勇，这刚毅的精神，是格外令人敬佩的。
    请看这种振奋人心的场面：当卡斯特罗要求人民“凡是要求惩处刽子手的请举手”的时候，“广场 上响起一片呼声，千万只手像一个人似地高举了起来。”这是人民的意志的表达，这是人民的判决，但这判决，却不仅是对于一小撮杀人的刽子手，而是对于一个强大凶恶的帝国主义；古巴人民，宣告了它的殖民政策的惨败。古巴人民的真正意志是彻底肃清帝国主义在古巴的势力。
    谁敢同帝国主义斗争，谁就最英勇，谁就最光荣。这是不受地域和民族的限制的。早就有人作出了榜样，去年伊拉克人民作出了榜样，今年古巴人民再一次作出了榜样，全世界人民都将争得这种光荣，人民的判决终将执行的。
