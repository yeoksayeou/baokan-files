Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 2nd: Gansu Province, in accordance with the new situation in agricultural development, is launching a magnificent water conservancy movement to advance towards new goals. The characteristics of this water conservancy construction are its grand scale, rapid progress, and good quality.

Gansu is known throughout the country for its aridity and mountainous terrain. In the past few years, the province's irrigated land has expanded from 4.71 million mu before liberation to 30 million mu, effectively resisting drought disasters and ensuring bumper harvests of grain and cotton. However, it still falls short of the requirements of the current new situation in agricultural development. The recent provincial water conservancy conference, in order to adapt to the new situation and meet the water needs of all parties, and to take water conservancy work to a higher level, put forward new arrangements for water conservancy work, pointing out that high standards and high requirements must be set for water conservancy.

Due to the complex terrain and different conditions in various parts of Gansu, water conservancy work is flourishing in a variety of ways. The overall goal is to develop towards river network reservoir-pond development and water conservancy systematization. Zhangye Prefecture, which has already achieved water conservancy, now has more than 300,000 people, soon to be increased to more than 500,000, launching a campaign to build 10,000 reservoirs, forming a string of pearls and stars in the sky, intercepting the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains, and transforming the Hexi Corridor into a high-yield cotton and grain base for the motherland. Dingxi Prefecture is vigorously engaged in a campaign of 10,000 reservoirs, 10,000 wells, and 1,000 canals. They are determined to change the face of drought and turn the arid prefecture into a water conservancy prefecture. In the Longdong area, 250,000 people are working hard and skillfully on water conservancy construction sites. Now, red flags are flying all over the mountains and plains, with construction, renovation, and irrigation forming a three-horse chariot, striving to realize the river network of the plateau and move all the rivers to the plateau.

Thanks to the superiority of the people's communes, this winter's water conservancy movement in Gansu Province has seen a surge of activity from the very beginning. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1.57 million people are engaged in water conservancy construction in various places, and the irrigated area has been expanded by 740,000 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 2nd: The largest winter water conservancy movement in the history of Inner Mongolia is rapidly unfolding throughout the autonomous region. Various water conservancy projects have also launched technical innovations and high work efficiency campaigns. Currently, from the Hetao area of the Yellow River to the southern foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains, 278,000 people of all ethnic groups have been invested in various large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects.

In areas of Inner Mongolia with existing small-scale water conservancy foundations, large and medium-sized backbone projects will begin to be constructed. The Yellow River Hetao Main Canal, known as the "Second Yellow River," is currently under construction. It is 400 kilometers long and has more than 70 large-scale sluice gates, bridges, and hydroelectric power stations. Upon completion, the entire project will become one of China's complete modern irrigation areas, guaranteeing timely and adequate irrigation for 16 million mu of farmland. Another Hongshan Reservoir, built on the Lao Ha River in the Zhaowuda League, is a key project for controlling the Liao River. Once completed, it can store more than 1.5 billion cubic meters of water, irrigate 2.7 million mu of farmland, generate more than 5,000 kilowatts of electricity, and ensure the water supply for a nearby 2.4 million kilowatt large-scale thermal power plant. In addition, 50 other large and medium-sized reservoirs are being built throughout the region.

In order to complete the water conservancy construction tasks for this winter and spring, various parts of Inner Mongolia have actively mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations and high work efficiency campaigns. On the construction site of the Yellow River Main Canal in the Bayannur League, all transportation will be mechanized within the next month. At the Wulan Mulun River Reservoir construction site, the use of aerial earth transportation equipment has recently increased work efficiency by three to five times compared to the past. In the Hulunbuir League, various water conservancy construction sites are promoting the use of ball bearings on carts and actively building ice roads to implement earth transportation on ice. Wulanchabu League, Hulunbuir League, and other places also advocate the use of frozen soil blasting methods when building reservoirs.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 2nd: Sichuan Province's winter water conservancy construction began with a focus on achieving semi-mechanized construction through technological innovation, and a wide-ranging high work efficiency campaign was launched. It was decided to work hard throughout the winter and spring to achieve water conservancy throughout the province, providing irrigation guarantees for an even greater leap forward in agriculture this year.

Sichuan Province has a very large scale of water conservancy construction throughout the year. According to preliminary estimates, the province needs to increase its water storage capacity by at least 23 billion cubic meters, which is several times more than the irrigation water increased from the winter before last to September of last year. Due to the short construction time, tight labor force, and heavy tasks, the local Party committees throughout the province, from the very beginning of the project in mid-December last year, seized the link of reforming tools and launched a mass high work efficiency campaign in various water conservancy projects, comprehensively reforming all kinds of old-fashioned tools from digging to transporting to ramming. According to statistics, various construction sites throughout the province manufactured dozens of types of improved tools totaling more than 2.4 million pieces before construction began, and widely promoted advanced operating technologies such as loose cliff blasting, directional blasting, and large blasting methods.

Running factories and tool repair and assembly stations at water conservancy construction sites, using local materials, local production, and local promotion are important measures taken by various places to achieve semi-mechanized construction. The 34 reservoir construction sites in Yilong County have established a total of 118 factories for alum production, iron tool manufacturing, lime, and earthen cement, and many rural hydropower stations and pond construction sites have also established tool repair and assembly stations and promotion stations. These factories have produced more than 40,000 earthen carts and more than 180,000 catties of lime, enabling most of the reservoirs under construction to use improved tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 2nd: The water conservancy construction事业 in Yunnan Province is continuing to develop vigorously on the basis of the great achievements made in 1958. Millions of migrant workers building water conservancy projects are working hard on new water conservancy construction sites.

In 1958 alone, Yunnan Province built 22 large-scale water conservancy projects, 361 medium-sized water conservancy projects, and 430,000 small-scale water conservancy projects. The completion of these water conservancy projects has increased the irrigated area by 15 million mu, greatly encouraging farmers throughout the province to advance towards achieving water conservancy. Now, more than 1.25 million laborers have been invested in water conservancy construction throughout the province, and 817 large-scale projects and medium-sized backbone projects have already started construction and are still increasing. Small-scale projects are spread throughout every corner of the province. This year, migrant workers have implemented a combination of hard work and skillful work as soon as they started work, trying every possible means to improve tools and increase work efficiency. After the Dongfeng Reservoir in Yuxi County realized the replacement of small carts with large carts and the use of ball bearings for vehicles, the work efficiency was significantly improved. The entire construction site has now used 217 ox carts and 116 horse carts equipped with ball bearings, with an average of more than 15 cubic meters of earth per ox cart going to the dam every day, and 40 cubic meters per horse cart. In addition, the installation of bearings on handcarts also has a good effect. On many reservoir construction sites, a work efficiency of more than six cubic meters of earth per person per day has been achieved as soon as work began. (Attached picture)

    甘肃内蒙古四川云南水利工地掀起高工效热潮
    本报兰州2日电　甘肃省根据农业发展的新形势，正在开展一个波澜壮阔的、向新的目标前进的水利运动。声势大、进度快、质量好是这次兴修水利的特点。
    甘肃在全国以干旱多山著名，几年来，全省水地从解放前的四百七十一万亩扩大到三千万亩，有力地抗御了干旱灾害，保证了粮棉大丰收，但距目前农业发展新形势的要求尚有很大距离。不久以前召开的全省水利会议，为了适应新的形势并满足各方面用水要求，使水利工作更上一层楼，对水利工作提出了新的安排，指出必须对水利提出高标准，高要求。
    甘肃由于地势复杂，各地的条件不同，水利工作是百花齐放，总的目的是向河网库塘化和水利系统化方向发展。已经实现水利化的张掖专区，现在由三十多万人，即将增加到五十多万人，正在开展修筑万座水库运动，使水库组成珍珠串，满天星，拦蓄祁连山雪水，将河西走廊变为祖国高产的棉粮基地。定西专区正在大搞万库万井千条渠运动，他们一定要改变干旱面貌，把干旱专区变为水利化专区。在陇东一带，有二十五万人在水利工地大干巧干。现在山塬川红旗漫卷，修、整、灌三马连环，正努力实现高原河网化，把所有的河道都搬到高原上去。
    甘肃省这个冬季的水利运动，由于人民公社化的优越性，一开始就出现了万马奔腾之势，据不完全统计，各地共有一百五十七万人在兴修水利，并且已扩大灌溉面积七十四万亩。
    本报呼和浩特2日电　内蒙古历史上规模最大的一次冬修水利运动，正在全自治区迅速展开。各水利工程还开展了技术革新和高工效运动。目前，从黄河后套到大兴安岭南麓，投入各项大中小型水利工程的各民族人民，已达二十七万八千人。
    内蒙古在小型水利已有基础的地区，将开始兴修大中型骨干工程。目前正在加紧兴建的号称“第二黄河”的黄河后套总干渠，长达四百公里，拥有较大的闸门、桥梁、水电站七十多座，全部工程完成后，将成为我国完整的现代化灌区之一，能保证一千六百万亩农田适时适量的灌溉。另一座在昭乌达盟境内老哈河上兴修的红山大水库，是根治辽河的一个关键性工程，修成后能蓄水十五亿多公方，灌溉农田二百七十万亩，发电五千多瓩，并可保证附近二百四十万瓩大型火电站的供水。此外，正在各地兴建的大中型水库还有五十座。
    为了完成去冬今春水利建设任务，内蒙古各地积极发动群众开展技术革新和高工效运动。在巴彦淖尔盟黄河总干渠工地上，将在下月内全部做到车子化。乌兰木沦河水库工地，最近使用空中运土器以后，工效比过去提高三倍到五倍。呼伦贝尔盟各水利工地正在推行车子滚珠轴承化，并积极修筑冰道，实行冰上运土。乌兰察布盟、呼伦贝尔盟等地在修建水库时，还提倡冻土爆破法。
    本报成都2日电　四川省冬修水利建设一开始便以革新技术实现半机械化施工为中心，广泛开展了高工效运动，决定大干一冬春，全省实现水利化，为今年农业更大的跃进提供灌溉保证。
    四川省全年水利建设规模很大。据初步估计，全省至少还需要增加二百三十亿公方的水量，这比前年冬季到去年9月增加的灌溉水量多几倍。由于建设时间短，劳力紧，任务大，全省各地党委从去年12月中旬工程一开始，即抓住改革工具这个环节，在各地水利工程中开展群众性的高工效运动，全面改革从挖土到运输、打夯等各种旧式工具。据统计，全省各工地在开工前就制造了几十种总数达二百四十多万件的各式改良工具，并广泛地推广了先进的操作技术如松崖爆破、定向爆破、大爆破等方法。
    大办水利工地施工工厂和工具修配站，就地取材，就地生产和就地推广，是各地实现半机械化施工中所采取的重要措施。仪陇县三十四座水库工地，一共就办了一百一十八个熬硝、铁材工具制造、石灰、土水泥等工厂，许多农村水电站和塘堰工地也建立了工具修配站和推广站。这些工厂已制出土车四万多辆，石灰十八万多斤，使已动工的水库大部使用了改良工具。
    本报昆明2日电　云南省水利建设事业正在1958年所取得的巨大成就的基础上，继续蓬勃发展。成百万修水利的民工正在新的水利工地上紧张劳动。
    1958年一年当中，云南全省兴修了二十二件大型水利工程，三百六十一件中型水利，四十三万件小型水利。这些水利工程的完成，增加了一千五百万亩灌溉面积，极大地鼓舞着全省农民向实现水利化挺进。现在，全省投入水利建设的劳动力已达一百二十五万多人，已开工的大型工程和中型骨干工程已有八百一十七处，而且还正在增加。小型的工程遍布全省每个角落。今年民工一上工就实行了苦干与巧干相结合，千方百计改良工具，提高工效。玉溪县东风水库实现大车代小车、车辆滚珠轴承化后，工效显著提高。全工地已用起安装了滚珠轴承的牛车二百一十七辆、马车一百一十六辆，平均每天每张单兜牛车上坝土方达十五方以上，每张马车达到四十方。另外还在地车上装上轴承，效果也很好。许多水库工地上一上阵就达到每人每日平均六个土方以上的工效。（附图片）
