    Support the Cuban People, Oppose US Interference!
    In these extraordinary days, the whole world is watching Havana. There, the heroic Cuban people, after overthrowing the Batista dictatorship, are fighting to eliminate the remnants of the old regime, consolidate the new regime, and oppose US interference. The mass demonstration of one million people in Havana on January 21 marked a new upsurge in the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle. Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro severely condemned the United States' blatant interference in Cuba's internal affairs. He declared that "Cuba demands not only political freedom but also economic freedom," and that Cuba will "revise and abolish all the privileges granted to foreign enterprises by the former Batista dictatorial government," clearly expressing the Cuban people's determination to defend the fruits of revolutionary victory and strive for independence, freedom, and democracy. The Chinese people, who have suffered the same fate as the Cuban people, wholeheartedly hail the great victory of the Cuban people and fully support the just struggle of the Cuban people.
    For many years, the Cuban people have waged a long-term struggle to end Batista's tyranny and the political control of Cuba by US imperialism, and to get rid of the cruel economic plunder by US monopoly capital. Two years ago, under the leadership of Castro, the Cuban people resolutely took up arms and engaged in a heroic battle against the dictatorial regime. US imperialism has always been extremely hostile to the just struggle of the Cuban people. On the one hand, it has given full military and economic support to the Batista regime, attempting to extinguish the uprising forces led by Castro and widely supported by the Cuban people. On the other hand, it has carried out divisive activities through certain pro-American elements, attempting to disintegrate the unity of Cuba's national democratic forces from within. However, all the efforts of US imperialism could not save the failure of the Cuban reactionaries. On the eve of the collapse of the Batista regime, US imperialism instructed Batista to hand over power to a "three-man military committee," attempting to secretly preserve the pro-American regime and prevent the victory of the Cuban revolutionary forces. However, the Cuban people were not fooled, resolutely marched into Havana, seized power, and established a provisional government. In the face of this general trend, the US government hurriedly put on a mask of "non-interference." US officials issued statements one after another, pretending to "not interfere" in Cuba's internal affairs, trying their best to pretend that they had nothing to do with Batista, categorically denying that they had supported the Batista regime's offensive against the Cuban insurgents, and after recognizing the Cuban provisional government, they also made various gestures to provide financial and economic assistance to the Cuban provisional government. This is certainly not the US colonialists laying down their butcher knives, but in the face of the rising national liberation movement, the United States does not dare to rashly offend the strong anti-American sentiment among the Cuban people and all the Latin American people, and can only wait for the opportunity and look for excuses. In the eyes of the US ruling group, the Cuban people will sooner or later escape from its palm. The January 9th issue of "US News & World Report" quite bluntly reflected this complacent attitude of the US ruling group. This mouthpiece of Wall Street wrote: "Cuba lives on the American market, American capital, and American tourists," "Cuba must have America."
    However, the Cuban people who have stood up are by no means only able to live by relying on American alms. After the establishment of the Cuban provisional government, it immediately announced the restoration of constitutional guarantees for freedom of the press and workers' rights, dissolved the old Congress and the special emergency courts established by the Batista regime to suppress Cuban patriots, removed all governors, mayors, and members of parliament of the old regime, and dissolved all the reactionary parties of the Batista era. Cuban leaders Castro and Urrutia have successively announced that they will implement land reform plans, make the Cuban public utilities controlled by US monopoly capital comply with Cuban management systems, and demand that the United States withdraw its military delegation stationed in Cuba. All of these have received the unanimous support of the Cuban people, but in the eyes of US imperialism, they are "utterly rebellious." Therefore, when the Cuban provisional government, in accordance with the demands of the people, severely punished Batista's remnants, the United States felt that the time had come and began to shout loudly under the banner of "humanitarianism." The US imperialists know that the Cuban people's war criminals, a group of bloodthirsty executioners under Batista, are precisely the internal support for the US colonialists to make a comeback. Therefore, from US congressmen to newspapers controlled by large financial groups, they frantically attacked the Cuban provisional government for being "inhumane," "not in accordance with democratic procedures," and engaging in "bloody revenge," and even clamored for "sanctions" against Cuba. US Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom even came out and said that the "Cuban authorities should consider American public opinion," directly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs. The purpose of the United States is to preserve Batista's remnants, so that one day they can collude internally and externally to subvert the Cuban provisional government and restore a dictatorial regime serving the United States. The imperialist face of the United States has once again been exposed without a doubt.
    Latin America has always been regarded by the United States as its own "backyard." US imperialism has never been reconciled to the fact that the dictators it fostered have been overthrown by the people of various Latin American countries, and it is even more unwilling to see Latin American countries that have overthrown dictatorial regimes embark on the road of democracy and freedom. It cannot tolerate even a slight breath of democracy and freedom, and must carry out interference with extreme ferocity until the new government is subverted. The subversion of the Arbenz democratic government in Guatemala in 1954 is the most barbaric example. In 1958 alone, US imperialism carried out three conspiracies to subvert the Venezuelan government, two to subvert the Argentine government, and one each to subvert the governments of Haiti, Bolivia, and Colombia. The people of Latin American countries, because they have such a vicious neighbor as US imperialism geographically, their struggle, although particularly complex and arduous, is precisely this vicious neighbor that makes it easier for the Latin American people to see the ugly face of US imperialism, so that once their national independence movement breaks out, it is unstoppable.
    In Latin America, the Cuban people are the first country to achieve complete victory by completely overthrowing the US-supported dictatorial regime through a long-term armed struggle. The victory of the Cuban people has already dealt a heavy blow to US imperialism. The victory of the Cuban people has aroused universal cheers and yearning among the people of all Latin American countries, and has given new strength to the national liberation movement in Latin America. The Cuban people, who have been tempered by the harsh war, are full of confidence and continue to fight for an independent, free, and democratic Cuba. The mass demonstration of one million people in Havana, resolutely fighting back against the interference of US imperialism, once again demonstrated the great unity and fearless fighting will of the Cuban people. A nation that is closely united and dares to fight is forever invincible!
    The Cuban people's struggle against US imperialist interference and for independence, freedom, and democracy is just, and the people of the world stand on your side. Although China and Cuba are thousands of miles apart, our 650 million people have always been concerned about the heroic struggle of the Cuban people. The common cause of opposing colonialism unites us. We will definitely stand with the people of the world, resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle for independence, freedom, and democracy, and resolutely oppose US imperialist interference in Cuba's internal affairs!

### 支持古巴人民，反对美国干涉！

    支持古巴人民，反对美国干涉！
    在这些不平常的日子里，全世界都注视着哈瓦那。在那里，英勇的古巴人民在推翻了巴蒂斯塔独裁统治之后，正在为肃清旧政权的余孽、巩固新政权、反对美国干涉而斗争。1月21日哈瓦那一百万群众大示威，标志着古巴人民革命斗争的新高涨。古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗严厉谴责美国横蛮干涉古巴的内政，他宣布“古巴不但要求政治上的自由，而且也要求经济上的自由”，古巴将要“修改和废除前巴蒂斯塔独裁政府给予外国企业的各种特权”，鲜明地表达了古巴人民保卫革命胜利果实，争取独立、自由和民主的决心。曾经遭受和古巴人民同样的命运的中国人民，衷心欢呼古巴人民的伟大胜利，全力支持古巴人民的正义斗争。
    多少年来，古巴人民为了结束巴蒂斯塔的暴政和美帝国主义对古巴的政治控制，为了摆脱美国垄断资本的残酷的经济掠夺，曾进行了长期的斗争。两年前，古巴人民在卡斯特罗的领导下，毅然决然地拿起武器，进行了反对独裁政权的英勇战斗。美帝国主义对古巴人民的正义斗争，一直是极端仇视的。它一方面在军事上、经济上全力支持巴蒂斯塔政权，企图扑灭由卡斯特罗领导的、得到古巴人民广泛支持的起义部队；另一方面则通过某些亲美分子，进行分化活动，企图从内部瓦解古巴民族民主力量的团结。但是，美帝国主义的一切努力，都挽救不了古巴反动派的失败。美帝国主义就在巴蒂斯塔政权崩溃的前夕，指使巴蒂斯塔把政权交给一个“三人军事委员会”，企图偷偷摸摸地把亲美政权保存下来，阻止古巴革命力量的胜利。但是，古巴人民没有上当，坚决进军哈瓦那，夺得了政权，建立了临时政府。在这种大势已去的情况下，美国政府就急急忙忙戴上了“不干涉”的面具。美国官方接二连三地发表声明，佯称“不干涉”古巴的内政，极力把自己装得似乎同巴蒂斯塔从来就没有什么关系，矢口否认曾支持巴蒂斯塔政权进攻古巴起义军，并且继承认了古巴临时政府之后，还做出要从财政上经济上接济古巴临时政府的种种姿态。这当然不是美国殖民主义者已经放下屠刀，而是在民族解放运动高涨的形势下，美国不敢贸然触犯古巴人民和全拉丁美洲人民中强烈的反美情绪，只好等待时机和寻找借口。在美国统治集团看来，古巴人民迟早是逃不出它的手掌心的。1月9日的“美国新闻与世界报道”就相当露骨地反映了美国统治集团的这种有恃无恐的态度。这家华尔街的喉舌写道：“古巴是靠美国的市场、美国的资金和美国的游客活命的”，“古巴必须要有美国”。
    但是，站起来的古巴人民，决不是只有依靠美国的施舍才能生活的。古巴临时政府成立后，立即宣布恢复对出版自由、工人权利的宪法保证，解散旧国会和巴蒂斯塔政权为镇压古巴爱国者而设立的特别紧急法庭，解除旧政权所有的省长、市长和议员的职务，解散巴蒂斯塔时代的一切反动政党。古巴领导人卡斯特罗和乌鲁蒂亚先后宣布将执行土地改革计划，将使美国垄断资本控制的古巴公用事业遵守古巴的管理制度，将要求美国撤回驻古巴的军事代表团。所有这些，都受到了古巴全国人民的一致支持，但在美帝国主义看来，却是“大逆不道”。因此，当古巴临时政府顺应人民要求，雷厉风行地惩治巴蒂斯塔的余党的时候，美国就认为时机已到，就打着“人道主义”的招牌大喊大叫起来了。美帝国主义者知道，古巴人民的战犯、巴蒂斯塔手下的一批杀人不眨眼的刽子手，正是美国殖民主义者卷土重来的内应。于是从美国的议员到大财团所控制的报纸，疯狂地攻击古巴临时政府“不人道”、“不合民主程序”、“血腥报复”，甚至叫嚣要“制裁”古巴。美国国务院助理国务卿鲁博特姆居然出来说什么要“古巴当局考虑美国的舆论”，直接干涉古巴内政。美国的目的就是要保存巴蒂斯塔的余党，以便有朝一日里应外合地颠复古巴临时政府，复辟为美国效劳的独裁政权。美国的帝国主义面目又一次暴露无遗了。
    拉丁美洲一直被美国看成是自己的“后院”。美帝国主义从来就是不甘心于它所抚育的独裁者们被拉丁美洲各国人民推翻的，它更不愿意看到推翻了独裁政权的拉丁美洲国家走上民主自由的道路，那怕是稍带一些民主自由气息的它都不能容忍，而一定要穷凶极恶地进行干涉，直到颠复新政府为止。1954年颠复危地马拉的阿本斯民主政府，就是最野蛮的一例。1958年一年里，美帝国主义就进行了三次颠复委内瑞拉政府、两次颠复阿根廷政府、一次颠复海地、玻利维亚和哥伦比亚等国政府的阴谋活动。拉丁美洲国家的人民，由于在地理上有了美帝国主义这样一个恶邻居，他们的斗争，虽然特别复杂和艰巨，但是，也正是这个恶邻居，使拉丁美洲人民更加容易地看清美帝国主义的丑恶的面目，使他们的民族独立运动一经爆发，就势不可挡。
    在拉丁美洲，古巴人民是经过长期武装斗争，彻底打倒了美国支持的独裁政权而取得完全胜利的第一个国家。古巴人民的胜利已经给了美帝国主义以沉重的打击。古巴人民的胜利，已经在拉丁美洲各国人民中引起了普遍的欢呼和向往，给了拉丁美洲的民族解放运动以新的力量。古巴人民经过了严酷的战争的锻炼，正充满信心，再接再厉，为独立、自由和民主的古巴而继续战斗。哈瓦那一百万人大示威，坚决反击美帝国主义的干涉，再一次显示了古巴人民伟大的团结力量和大无畏的斗争意志。一个紧密团结和敢于斗争的民族，是永远不可战胜的！
    古巴人民反对美帝国主义干涉，争取独立、自由和民主的斗争，是正义的，全世界人民站在你们一边。中国同古巴虽然相距万里迢迢，但是，我们六亿五千万人民一直关怀着古巴人民所进行的英勇斗争。反对殖民主义的共同事业把我们联结在一起。我们一定同全世界人民一道，坚决支持古巴人民争取独立、自由和民主的斗争，坚决反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政！
