    Mass Inspection, Mass Competition, Mass Appraisal
    Yangcheng County's All-Out Effort to Accumulate Fertilizer
    (By Our Newspaper) Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, is currently engaged in a large-scale mass campaign to accumulate fertilizer in a concentrated month-long effort. As of January 15th, the county had accumulated a total of 21.8 billion jin of farm manure; in addition, 621 soil fertilizer, bone fertilizer, granular fertilizer, and peat factories were established and restored, producing more than 13 million jin of fertilizer.
    The slogan for the fertilizer accumulation campaign month is: "The whole Party mobilizes, the whole people act, everyone accumulates fertilizer, fertilizer is accumulated everywhere, with accumulation as the main focus, combining accumulation and manufacturing." The county has developed more than 50 kinds of fertilizer sources by using methods such as bedding in livestock pens, smoking fertilizer, composting, digging garbage, roof soil, mud coal, and river mud.
    In order to make the movement rise wave upon wave, from the county to the communes, the Party committee secretaries personally took command, led by Party members, League members, and cadres, and formulated a series of management systems and methods of assigning tasks at each level. Zheng Zhigang, the head of Dongye Township, led people out to collect manure at night. Under his organization and leadership, a fertilizer accumulation team composed of more than 300 cadres, staff, and students collected more than 50,000 jin of various fertilizers in seven days. A total of 8,520 Party members, League members, and cadres in the county collected more than 3.4 million jin of manure. During the movement, the enthusiasm of the commune members for accumulating fertilizer was greatly stimulated due to the reasonable solution of the problem of remuneration for fertilizer accumulation. The county also used the method of mass inspection, mass competition, and mass appraisal to increase the quantity and improve the quality of fertilizer accumulation. (Picture attached)

    大检查　大竞赛　大评比
    阳城县全民突击积肥
    本报讯　山西阳城县正展开一个声势浩大的群众性积肥突击月。这个县到1月15日为止，全县共积农家肥料二百十八亿斤；另外建立和恢复了制土化肥、骨肥、颗粒肥、泥炭厂六百二十一座，制出肥料一千三百多万斤。
    积肥突击月的口号是：“全党动员，全民动手，人人积肥，处处积肥，以积为主，积造并举”。全县采用垫圈、熏肥、沤肥、挖垃圾、屋土、泥煤、河泥等方法，开辟了五十多种肥源。
    为了使运动一浪高一浪，从县到公社，党委书记都亲自挂帅，由党、团员和干部带头，并制定了一系列的管理制度和层层包任务的办法。东冶乡长郑治刚在晚上带人外出拾粪，在他的组织和领导下，一支由干部、职工、学生三百多人组成的积肥队，七天内拾各种肥料五万余斤。全县八千五百二十个党、团员干部，共拾粪三百四十余万斤。运动中，由于合理解决了积肥报酬问题，大大刺激了社员积肥积极性。这个县还用大检查、大竞赛、大评比的办法，使积肥数量猛增，质量也提高。（附图片）
