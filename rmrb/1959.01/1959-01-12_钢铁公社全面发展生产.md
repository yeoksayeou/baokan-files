    据黑龙江日报消息　黑龙江东宁县大肚川钢铁人民公社党委在最近召开的各管理区队长以上干部会议上，根据十大倡议的精神，检查了工作和思想，修订了1959年的生产规划。农业生产要根据积极稳妥实行少种高产多收的方针和八字“宪法”的精神，使总产量比去年显著提高；工业要根据勤俭办厂的原则增设修配、炼油、化肥、农药等大小工厂二百二十座；在多种经营方面，要根据自然条件建立专业生产队和组织临时性突击生产，把农林牧副渔全面抓起来。
    目前，这个公社正以搞好整社，进一步修订生产规划，大搞冬季生产的实际行动响应十大倡议。在副业生产方面，全公社已由过去一百多人增加到三百多人，计划从现在到春耕前，由过去原计划副业收入十五万元增加到二十万元。（附图片）
