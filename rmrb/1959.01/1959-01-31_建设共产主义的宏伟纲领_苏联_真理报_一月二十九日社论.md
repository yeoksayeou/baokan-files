The grand Program for Building Communism
*Pravda* Editorial, January 29, Soviet Union

    Millions of people in our country and abroad are closely following the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the Congress of Builders of Communism. Our Party Congress is discussing the most important issues of communist construction in an atmosphere of complete consensus, high Leninism of principle and a spirit of seeking truth from facts. The work of the Congress vividly demonstrates the unity of the Party and its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, as well as its inextricable link with the people.

    The report by Comrade Khrushchev on "Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the USSR for 1959-1965" left a very deep impression on the delegates to the Congress, the representatives of the fraternal parties, the Soviet people, and the world public. The report reflects the entire historical era of the activities of our Party and the Soviet people. It summarizes the brilliant victories of socialism in our country, puts forward a program for the comprehensive development of a communist society, and demonstrates the prospects for the development of Soviet society.

    In these days of discussing the grand program of communist construction, we recall, again and again, the glorious path our motherland has traversed under the leadership of the Leninist Party since the establishment of Soviet power. Shortly after the victory of the October Revolution, when the Party and the Soviet people were taking their first steps along a new and untested road, V. I. Lenin said at the Seventh Party Congress: "When we begin socialist transformations, we should clearly set ourselves the ultimate goal of these transformations, namely, the goal of building a communist society..." This great goal has always inspired our Party and the Soviet people to build heroic achievements. The Party's tremendous organizational work and the Soviet people's great labor have finally won brilliant victories.

    Our country has become a powerful industrial-collective farm socialist state, its industrial output ranking first in Europe and second in the world. The Soviet state has achieved particularly great achievements by implementing the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. The delegates to the Congress pointed out that, with these achievements, it has become increasingly clear how correct our Party and its Central Committee were in resolutely condemning and crushing the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who attempted to sabotage the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and attempted to divert the Party from the Leninist path.

    Socialism has not only achieved a complete victory in the Soviet Union, but also a thorough victory. Now, our country is entering a new historical stage of development—the stage of comprehensively developing the construction of a communist society. The goals of the Party and the people in this period should be to establish the material and technical basis of communism, further strengthen the economic and defense power of the Soviet Union, and at the same time, increasingly fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. We need to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output. Achieving these goals will take more than seven years. The Seven-Year Plan is the most important component of the fifteen-year perspective plan for the development of our country's economy and culture.

    The main tasks of our country in the seven years that have already begun were extremely clearly defined in Khrushchev's report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU. These tasks are:

    In the economic aspect: To comprehensively develop the country's productive forces, and on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, to achieve such growth in the production of all economic sectors that it is possible to take a decisive step in establishing the material and technical basis of communism and ensuring the victory of the Soviet Union in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries. The strengthening of the country's economic strength, the further technical development of all sectors of the national economy, and the continuous growth of social labor productivity will guarantee a substantial increase in the people's living standards.

    In the political aspect: To further consolidate the socialist system in the Soviet Union, further strengthen the unity of the Soviet people, promote Soviet democracy, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people in building a communist society, expand the functions of social organizations in solving state problems, improve the organizational and educational role of the Party and the socialist state, and fully consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    In the ideological aspect: To strengthen the Party's ideological and educational work, raise the communist consciousness of the working people, especially the growing generation, and educate them with a communist attitude towards labor, with Soviet patriotism and internationalism, to overcome the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, and to fight against bourgeois ideology.

    In international relations: To consistently implement a foreign policy of maintaining and consolidating peace and the security of all countries and peoples in accordance with the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Efforts must be made to end the "cold war" and ease international tensions. Strive to strengthen the world socialist system and the big family of fraternal peoples.

    These concise and clear points clearly illustrate the Party's and the people's multifaceted and purposeful activities at the current stage of communist construction.

    The fundamental issue for the next seven years is the issue of maximizing time in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism. The report on control figures put forward a concrete program for further rapid development of industry, agriculture, science and culture, and a substantial increase in the welfare of the working people. In order to take a decisive step in establishing the material and technical basis of communism in seven years, it is stipulated that the total industrial output in 1965 will increase by about 80% compared with 1958, of which the first category (production of means of production) will increase by 85% to 88%, and the second category (production of consumer goods) will increase by 62% to 65%.

    At the same time, it is stipulated that the total agricultural output value will increase by 70%. The total investment in the national economy will reach about three trillion rubles. This is approximately equal to the total investment in the entire Soviet era. Only by greatly improving social labor productivity can the Seven-Year Plan be successfully completed. On the basis of continuous technological development, comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, it is planned to achieve the following growth in labor productivity per worker in various sectors: industry increases by 45%-50%, construction increases by 60%-65%, railway transportation increases by 34%-37%, state farms increase by 60%-65%, and collective farms increase by about 100%. Improving labor productivity is the main source of expanding socialist reproduction and accumulation, and the foundation for improving the living standards of the working people. The Seven-Year Plan guarantees the correct combination of the interests of the various republics and the entire Soviet Union. Our plan vividly embodies Lenin's national policy, which creates broad possibilities for the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all nationalities.

    The Seven-Year Plan is full of the Communist Party's concern for further improving the welfare of the Soviet people, the unprecedented scale of housing construction, the increase in the production of various consumer goods for the people, the reduction of working hours, the increase in wages, especially the increase in the wages of low-wage workers, the improvement of preferential treatment guarantees, and many other measures.

    The prerequisite for successfully resolving the task of comprehensively developing the construction of a communist society is to improve the communist consciousness of the working people while improving material welfare production. All ideological work of our Party and state is to develop the new qualities of the Soviet people, to educate the people with the spirit of collectivism and love of labor, with the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, with the spirit of the high principles of the new social morality, and with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

    Comrade Khrushchev's report also elucidated the most important issues of the Marxist-Leninist theory concerning the transition from socialism to communism. On the basis of deeply summarizing the extremely rich experience of socialist construction in our country and the experience of other socialist countries and the communist movement worldwide, significant theoretical conclusions were drawn. These questions concern the two stages of communist society and the laws of transition from socialism to communism, the establishment of the material and technical basis of communist society, the distribution of material and spiritual wealth created by society under socialism and communism, the path of development and rapprochement of the collective farm form and the all-people form of socialist ownership, the social and political organization, state structure, and management during the period of comprehensively developing the construction of a communist society, the development of the world socialist system, and other important issues of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Studying these major theoretical issues in close connection with the practice of communist construction is a major contribution to the creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

    The delegates speaking at the Congress and the representatives of the fraternal communist and workers' parties all pointed out the great international significance of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. They said that this plan will have a profound impact on the entire international situation and is a new victory for Marxism-Leninism.

    On the international stage, the economic competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system, is underway. The superiority of socialism over the increasingly declining and contradictory capitalism is being demonstrated more and more widely and fully. According to economists, as a result of the completion and overfulfillment of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, as well as the high-speed development of the economies of the People's Democratic countries, the industrial output value of the countries of the world socialist system will account for more than half of the world's industrial output value. This will guarantee that the world socialist system surpasses the world capitalist system in the material production that is of decisive significance to human activity. And this will be a victory of world-historic significance.

    The Seven-Year Plan is a plan for peaceful construction. It reflects Lenin's policy of peace and is imbued with a spirit of peace-loving. The realization of this plan, as well as the economic plans of all socialist countries, will play a huge role in solving the basic problem of our time—defending universal peace—and will create realistic possibilities in eliminating the use of war as a means of solving international problems.

    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attended by delegations from fraternal communist and workers' parties from seventy countries around the world, is an important event of world significance. The congratulatory messages at the Congress from the heads of the delegations of the Communist Party of China, the Polish United Workers' Party, the Italian Communist Party, and the French Communist Party demonstrated the solidarity of the international communist movement and the unwavering belief in the principles of Marxism-Leninism. All attempts by reactionary forces and modern revisionists to undermine this unity are doomed to failure.

    The 21st Congress of the CPSU continues to meet in an atmosphere of the Soviet people's tremendous creativity and rising labor enthusiasm. Many responses from all over the Soviet Union are filled with the Soviet people's love for their dear Communist Party.

    The Soviet people regard Lenin's Party as their long-tested leader, and regard the Party's wise leadership as a guarantee of new communist victories. The Soviet people unanimously support the grand program of communist construction formulated by the Party and express their firm determination to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan.

    建设共产主义的宏伟纲领
    苏联“真理报”一月二十九日社论
    我们国家和国外的千百万人都在密切注意苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会——共产主义建设者的代表大会。我们党的代表大会正在意见完全一致、高度的列宁主义原则性和实事求是精神的气氛中讨论共产主义建设的最重要的问题。代表大会的工作鲜明而生动地显示了党的团结一致和它对马克思列宁主义的忠诚以及它同人民的千丝万缕的联系。
    赫鲁晓夫同志所作的“关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告给代表大会的代表和兄弟党的代表，给苏联人民和全世界公众都留下了极深刻的印象。报告反映了我们党和苏联人民的活动的整个历史时代。它总结了我国社会主义的辉煌胜利，提出了全面展开共产主义社会建设的纲领，展示了苏维埃社会发展的远景。
    在讨论共产主义建设的宏伟纲领的日子里，我们一次再一次地回顾我们的祖国自苏维埃政权建立以来在列宁主义党的领导下所走过的光荣道路。十月革命胜利后不久，当党和苏联人民沿着新的、尚未经受考验的道路迈出头几步的时候，弗·伊·列宁就在第七次党代表大会上说：“我们开始社会主义改造的时候，应当给自己清楚地提出这些改造归根到底所要达到的目的，即建立共产主义社会的目的……”这一伟大的目的从前和现在一直在鼓舞着我们党和苏联人民去建树英雄的功绩。党的巨大的组织工作和苏联人民的伟大劳动终于获得了辉煌的胜利。
    我国成了强大的工业—集体农庄的社会主义国家，它的工业产值在欧洲占第一位，在世界占第二位。苏维埃国家由于实现了第二十次党代表大会的决议，取得了特别大的成就。大会代表们指出，有了这些成就，就越来越清楚地看出，我们的党和它的中央委员会是多么正确，它坚决地谴责并粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫的反党集团，这个集团企图破坏苏共第二十次代表大会的决议的执行，企图使党离开列宁主义的道路。
    社会主义在苏联不仅取得了完全的胜利，而且取得了彻底的胜利。现在，我们的国家正进入一个新的历史发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。党和人民在这个时期的努力目标应当是建立共产主义的物质技术基础，进一步加强苏联的经济威力和国防威力，同时越来越充分地满足人民日益增长的物质和文化需要。我们需要在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。达到这些目的，需要比七年更长的时间。七年计划是发展我国经济和文化的十五年远景计划的最重要的组成部分。
    在赫鲁晓夫向苏共第二十一次代表大会所作的报告中极其清楚地确定了我国在已经开始了的七年中的主要任务。这些任务是：
    在经济方面：全面发展国家的生产力，在优先发展重工业的基础上，使一切经济部门的生产获得这样的增长：能够在建立共产主义的物质技术基础和保证苏联同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利方面迈进决定性的一步。国家经济力量的加强、国民经济各部门在技术上的进一步发展、社会劳动生产率的不断增长将保障人民生活水平的大大提高。
    在政治方面：进一步巩固苏联的社会主义制度，进一步加强苏联人民的团结一致，发扬苏维埃民主，发挥广大人民群众在建设共产主义社会中的积极性和创造性，扩大社会团体在解决国家问题方面的职能，提高党和社会主义国家的组织作用和教育作用，全力巩固工农联盟和苏联各族人民的友谊。
    在思想方面：加强党的思想教育工作，提高劳动人民、首先是成长中的一代的共产主义觉悟，用对待劳动的共产主义态度，用苏维埃爱国主义和国际主义来教育他们，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，同资产阶级思想作斗争。
    在国际关系方面：本着不同社会制度的国家和平共处的列宁主义原则，始终如一地执行维护和巩固和平和各国人民的安全的外交政策。必须争取停止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势。竭力加强世界社会主义体系和兄弟人民的大家庭。
    这些扼要明确的论点清楚地说明了党和人民在共产主义建设的现阶段的、多方面的和目标明确的活动。
    今后七年的根本问题，是在社会主义同资本主义和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间的问题。关于控制数字的报告中提出了进一步迅速发展工业、农业和科学文化和大大提高劳动人民福利的具体纲领，并且为了在七年中在建立共产主义物质技术基础方面迈进决定性的步骤，规定1965年的工业总产量比1958年大约增加80％，其中第一部类（生产资料的生产）增加85％到88％，第二部类（消费品的生产）增加62％到65％。
    同时，规定将农业总产值增加70％。国民经济投资总额将达到三万亿卢布左右。这大约等于苏维埃政权整个年代中投资的总和。只有在大大提高社会劳动生产率的情况下，才能顺利完成七年计划。在不断发展技术、全盘机械化和生产过程自动化的基础上，计划使各部门每个工作者的劳动生产率达到如下的增长规模：工业增长45％—50％、建筑业增长60％—65％、铁路运输增长34％—37％、国营农场增长60％—65％、集体农庄大约增长一倍。提高劳动生产率是扩大社会主义再生产和积累的主要源泉，是提高劳动人民生活水平的基础。七年计划保证使各共和国和整个苏联的利益正确的结合起来。我们的计划生动地体现了列宁的民族政策，这个政策为全面发展各族人民的经济和文化创造了广泛的可能性。
    七年计划充满了共产党对进一步提高苏联人民福利的关怀、住宅建筑的空前规模、人民各种消费品产量的增加、工作日的减少、工资的提高，特别是低工资职工工资的提高、优抚保障的改善以及其他许多措施都说明了这一点。
    顺利解决全面展开共产主义社会建设任务的前提是：在提高物质福利生产的同时，提高劳动人民的共产主义觉悟。我们党和国家的一切思想工作，都是要发展苏联人的新品质，要用集体主义和热爱劳动的精神，用社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的精神，用新社会道德的高度原则的精神，用马克思列宁主义的精神来教育人民。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告还阐明了有关从社会主义过渡到共产主义的马克思列宁主义理论的最重要的问题。在深刻地总结我国社会主义建设的极其丰富的经验和其他社会主义国家以及全世界共产主义运动的经验的基础上，作出了具有巨大意义的理论性结论。这些问题就是关于共产主义社会的两个阶段和从社会主义过渡到共产主义的规律，关于建立共产主义社会的物质技术基础，关于在社会主义和共产主义条件下社会创造的物质和精神财富的分配，关于社会主义所有制的集体农庄形式和全民形式的发展和接近的道路，关于在全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的社会政治组织、国家结构和管理，关于世界社会主义体系的发展以及马克思列宁主义理论的其它一些最重要的问题。
    密切联系共产主义建设的实践来研究这些重大的理论问题，是对创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的重大贡献。
    在大会上发言的代表和兄弟共产党和工人党的代表都指出了苏联七年计划的重大的国际意义。他们说，这个计划将对整个国际形势产生有深远的影响，它是马克思列宁主义的新的胜利。
    在国际舞台上，正在进行着苏联和美国的经济竞赛，以及世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系的竞赛。社会主义对日趋衰亡和充满矛盾的资本主义的优越性日益广泛而充分地显示出来了。据经济学家计算，由于苏联发展国民经济七年计划的完成和超额完成，以及人民民主国家的经济的高速度发展的结果，世界社会主义体系国家的工业产值将占世界工业产值的一半以上。这将保证世界社会主义体系在人类活动具有决定意义的物质生产方面超越世界资本主义体系。而这将是一个具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    七年计划是和平建设的计划。它反映了列宁的和平政策，它贯穿着爱好和平的精神。实现这计划以及所有社会主义国家的经济计划，将在解决保卫普遍和平这一当代基本问题上起着巨大的作用，同时将在消除利用战争作为解决国际问题的手段方面创造现实的可能性。
    有世界上七十个国家的兄弟共产党和工人党代表团出席了苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，这次大会是一桩具有世界意义的重要事件。中国共产党、波兰统一工人党、意大利共产党和法国共产党代表团团长在代表大会上的祝词显示了国际共产主义运动的团结一致，显示了对马克思列宁主义原则的不可动摇的信念。反动势力和现代修正主义者破坏这种团结的一切企图都注定要失败的。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会在我国各族人民的巨大创造力和劳动热情高涨的情况下继续开会。来自苏联各地的许多反应充满着苏联人民对自己亲爱的共产党的热爱。
    苏联人民把列宁的党视为自己久经考验的领袖，把党的英明领导视为是共产主义新胜利的保证。苏联人民一致拥护党所制定的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领，并表示完成和超额完成七年计划任务的坚定的决心。
