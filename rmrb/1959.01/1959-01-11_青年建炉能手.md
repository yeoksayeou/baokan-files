On the steel front, there is a furnace building expert named Wang Qichao. He is a young man who has come to love Helan County since moving there from Chaoyi County, Shaanxi. This time, he enthusiastically signed up to join the Helan County Steel Expeditionary Force to smelt iron in Helan Mountain, also serving as the leader of the furnace building team. He had never seen an iron smelting furnace before. Initially, many of the furnaces he built either produced no iron or the iron and glaze did not separate. He was very anxious. If iron couldn't be smelted, how could the task be completed? A high sense of responsibility made him uneasy, and sometimes he even dreamed about furnace building problems. Later, with the support of the Party branch of the iron smelting company, a discussion meeting was held. Based on everyone's suggestions and inspiration, Wang Qichao came up with the idea of "building a ground furnace shaped like a jar, with a large middle and small ends, to both draw fire and retain heat." After testing, the jar-shaped small ground furnace loaded 500 jin of ore, resulting in 125 jin of good iron. The successful news encouraged everyone.

One day, Wang Qichao was at the furnace side introducing the digging method and advantages of the jar-shaped ground furnace to others. Zhou Zhankui, the Party Branch Secretary of the Steel Company, walked over and said to them, "The jar-shaped ground furnace built by your team is very good. The branch wants us to build another forty-one large jar furnaces, to be completed in five days. Is that possible?" "We can do it! We guarantee completion!" Wang Qichao replied excitedly. He led a dozen people, working continuously for two days and nights, and built thirty-eight ground furnaces. Wang Qichao's eyes were bloodshot. Secretary Zhou advised him, "You need to rest for a while. Let other comrades build the last three furnaces!" Everyone also said that he should rest. But Wang Qichao resolutely replied, "No way! I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I must complete this task." He not only completed the last three furnaces ahead of schedule, but also worked with everyone to build two additional experimental furnaces, personally loading and smelting them. These two experimental furnaces produced more than two tons of good iron, with an iron output rate more than 60% higher than that of ordinary furnaces.

    青年建炉能手
    在钢铁战线上，有个建炉能手王气朝。他是个青年小伙子，自从陕西朝邑县迁移到贺兰县以后，他很热爱这地方。这回他积极报名参加了贺兰县钢铁远征军，去到贺兰山炼铁，还担任建炉班的班长。他从来没有见过炼铁炉。开始建了好些炉，不是不出铁就是铁釉不分家。他很着急，炼不出铁来，怎么完成任务呢？高度的责任感，使他不安，有时作梦也想建炉问题，后来在炼铁连党支部的支持下开了个漫谈会。在大家的建议和启发下，王气朝想出了“建个炉膛中间大，两头小，既扯火又保温的坛子式的地炉。”经过试验，坛子式的小地炉装矿石五百斤，结果出好铁一百二十五斤。成功的消息鼓舞了大家。
    有一天，王气朝在炉边向别人介绍坛子式地炉的挖法和它的优点，钢铁连党支书周占魁同志走过来对他们说：“你们班建的坛子式地炉很好，支部要我们再建四十一个大的坛子炉，五天完成，可以吗？”“能行！保证完成”。王气朝很激动地回答。他带领着十几个人，连续干了两昼夜，就建成了三十八个地炉。王气朝的眼睛熬红了，周书记劝他：“你要休息一会，最后三个炉留给其他同志建吧！”大家也说，他该休息了。但王气朝很坚决地回答：“不行！我是共青团员，一定把这个任务完成”。他不但提前建成了最后三个炉，还和大家另外搞了两个试验炉，亲自装炉冶炼。这两个试验炉出好铁两吨多，出铁率还比一般炉高60％以上。　　（兴干）
