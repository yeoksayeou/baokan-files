Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 31st: On the eve of the New Year, political life in Washington appears as calm as usual. However, behind this apparent tranquility, one can sense the serious unease among many American national leaders, political figures, and ordinary Americans regarding the results of 1958 and the prospects for American development in 1959.

No amount of optimistic rhetoric from certain American newspapers can dispel this anxiety this time.

Hans Morgenthau, Director of the University of Chicago's Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy and a member of the Democratic Party's National Advisory Committee on Foreign Policy, wrote in an article in "The New Republic" magazine, sorrowfully stating that there was a time when we were satisfied when we compared our current situation with our past strength and future prospects. He continued, but now, the superiority of our way of life, in terms of political and economic achievements, is not so obvious, either to us or to the rest of the world. He said, "For millions of people, the communist way of life is more attractive than ours."

Fred Trull, a commentator for "The Washington Star," also said that 1958 was characterized by "very obvious and very serious failures for the West (primarily the United States - editor's note), with either communism or neutralism and anti-Western nationalism gaining the upper hand. And in those countries that remain loyal to the Western alliance, democracy has given way to military dictatorship or other forms of autocracy... thereby making the term 'Free World' even more hollow than usual." Trull pointed out that in summarizing 1958, it can be said that "from a political point of view, the West is in a much worse position than it was a year ago."

One of the biggest characteristics of American domestic political life in 1958 was the unprecedentedly frequent and sharp criticism of American foreign policy by congressmen, the business community, and the public, and the demand for fundamental changes in this policy. It is no accident that there is a growing call in the United States to end the absurd "brink of war" policy.

In a New Year's poll conducted by the Associated Press a few days ago, a question was asked: "What is your greatest hope for your country in the coming year of 1959?" More than 55% of the people who participated in the survey simply wrote two words: "Peace."

The results of the November election, in which the ruling Republican Party suffered a crushing defeat, reflected the dissatisfaction of people from all walks of life in the United States with American domestic and foreign policy. This dissatisfaction is also the direct reason why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a statement that it will immediately conduct a comprehensive study of American foreign policy after the next Congress begins its work.

Ordinary Americans are not very convinced by the rosy prospects of "economic prosperity" in the coming year sometimes depicted by individual American economists and politicians. It is no wonder that some local commentators pointed out that one of the reasons that prompted President Eisenhower to take the unprecedented step of issuing a statement on the US budget for the next fiscal year three weeks before submitting the budget message to Congress was to give some comfort to ordinary Americans facing further deterioration of the economic situation. However, many American experts believe that Eisenhower's promises that despite continued increases in military spending, the US budget for the next fiscal year will be "balanced" and taxes will not increase, are all just "empty words."

When Americans compare their country's economic situation with the great achievements of the Soviet Union, and with the Soviet Union's magnificent economic plans, they become particularly uneasy about their country's economic situation. The Soviet Union's economic and political achievements have aroused fear in some American groups. Morgenthau wrote that the United States, for the first time in history, "as a representative of a certain way of life" faces a challenge, "Our opponent is not a foreign industry or a foreign government pursuing an economic policy hostile to us, but the communist social system... The Soviet Union has chosen the economy as the battlefield, and communism will achieve a decisive victory on this battlefield."

    华盛顿年景黯淡
    美国公众对今年前途深感不安
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿12月31日讯：新年前夕，华盛顿的政治生活看来照例沉寂无事，然而在这外表沉寂的后面，却可以感到很多美国国家领导人和政界人士以及普通的美国人对1958年的结果和1959年美国的发展前途的严重不安。
    某些美国报刊的任何乐观论调，这一次都不能打消这种不安。
    芝加哥大学美国外交政策研究室主任、民主党外交政策全国谘询委员会委员摩根索，在“新共和”杂志上写的文章里忧愁地说道，曾经有过一个时期，当我们把我们的现状同过去的力量和将来的前景相比较时，我们都感到满意。他接着说，但是现在，我们生活方式的优越性，从政治和经济的成果来讲，无论对我们，或者对其余的世界都不是那么明显了。他说，“对于亿万人来说，共产主义的生活方式要比我们的生活方式更具有吸引力”。
    “华盛顿明星报”评论员弗雷德·特鲁也这样说，1958年的特点是“西方（首先是美国——原编者注）遭到了非常明显的和非常严重的失败，不是让共产主义，就是让中立主义和反西方的民族主义占了上风。而在那些仍然忠实于西方联盟的国家里，民主已让位给军事专政或其他形式的独裁……从而使‘自由世界’这个词变成比通常更加空洞”。特鲁指出，在总结1958年时可以说，“从政治角度看来，西方的处境比一年前要坏得多”。
    1958年美国国内政治生活的最大特点之一，是国会议员、工商界和公众空前频繁地尖锐抨击美国的外交政策和要求根本改变这种政策，这一情况不是偶然的。在美国，要求结束荒唐的“战争边缘”政策的呼声越来越高。
    美联社前几天进行的新年前民意测验中曾经提出一个问题：“在即将到来的1959年中，你对自己国家所抱的最大希望是什么？”55％以上参加测验的人都只是写了两个字：“和平”。
    11月选举的结果，表现了美国各阶层人民对美国内政和外交政策的不满，执政的共和党在这次选举中遭受了惨败。这种不满情绪，也是使参议院外交委员会发表这样一种声明的直接原因：在下届国会开始工作后，将立即全面研究美国外交政策。
    普通的美国人不很相信美国个别经济学家和政治家有时描绘的在未来一年中会有“经济繁荣”的美好前景。无怪乎当地的一些评论员指出，促使艾森豪威尔总统采取史无前例的步骤，即在向国会提出预算咨文前的三个星期就发表关于美国下一财政年度的预算的声明的一个原因，是想给予面对着经济情况进一步恶化的普通美国人以某种安慰。但是，许多美国专家认为：艾森豪威尔保证说尽管军事开支继续增加，美国下一财政年度的预算将“得到平衡”，税额也不会增加，这一切诺言只是“一纸空文”。
    当美国人把自己国家的经济状况同苏联的巨大成就，同苏联的宏伟的经济计划相比较时，他们就对自己国家的经济状况特别不安。苏联的经济成就和政治成就引起了美国某些集团的恐惧。摩根索写道，美国在有史以来第一次“做为某种生活方式的代表”面临着挑战，“我们的对手不是外国的工业或者执行敌视我们的经济政策的外国政府，而是共产主义的社会制度……苏联选择了经济作为战场，共产主义在这个战场上将取得决定性的胜利”。
