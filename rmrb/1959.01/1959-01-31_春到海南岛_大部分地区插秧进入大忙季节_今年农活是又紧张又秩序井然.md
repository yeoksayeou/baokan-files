Spring Arrives in Hainan Island
    Most Areas Enter Busy Season for Rice Transplanting
    This Year's Farm Work is Both Tense and Orderly
    Guangzhou, January 30th (by our newspaper) – The eastern and southern areas of Hainan Island have entered the busy season for rice transplanting. More than 100,000 mu of basic farmland that have already been transplanted in Qionghai County (formerly Qiongdong, Wanning, and Lehui counties merged), Yai County, and southern Wenchang County appear particularly lush and green. More than 20,000 mu of rice have been transplanted in western and central counties. The western counties of Dongfang, Ledong, and Dan County are transplanting rice one season ahead of schedule, changing the old habit of the west not starting until after the east was finished.
    Now, more and more people on Hainan Island are engaged in spring plowing and rice transplanting, and the efficiency of rice transplanting is also increasing. In the fields of Qionghai County, which is leading in rice transplanting, there are work groups of five to seven people everywhere, cooperating to carry out rice transplanting. After entering the busy season of rice transplanting, the county immediately sent more than 2,400 commune and management area leaders at all levels to grassroots production units to participate in and lead production. At the same time, a campaign to improve rice transplanting efficiency, centered on rice transplanting experts, has been launched, increasing transplanting efficiency by more than double.
    The use of improved agricultural tools is another prominent feature of this year's rice transplanting. The more than 500 simple rice transplanters of the Hunan Liling type, which Qionghai County has just rushed to produce, are widely welcomed. Many handcarts and oxcarts with ball bearings are traveling back and forth in the fields to transport fertilizer. People are striving to apply several hundred more dan of fertilizer per mu on top of the more than one thousand dan of base fertilizer already applied before the final harrowing. All forces in the commune's wood factories and iron factories have been mobilized to manufacture various new agricultural tools to support spring plowing and rice transplanting.
    All of this constitutes a tense but orderly picture of spring plowing. The quality of this year's spring plowing and rice transplanting on Hainan Island far exceeds that of last year's early season. This year, more than 1.26 million mu of basic farmland have been deep-plowed to a depth of one foot or more, which is five or six inches deeper than last year. Most fields have been applied with more than 1,000 dan of base fertilizer in layers, which is five or six times more than last year. This year, most fields are being transplanted two or three times more densely than last year's early season.

    春到海南岛
    大部分地区插秧进入大忙季节
    今年农活是又紧张又秩序井然
    本报广州30日电　海南岛东部和南部地区已进入插秧大忙季节。琼海县（原琼东、万宁、乐会三县合并）、崖县、文昌县南部已插秧的十万多亩基本农田，显得格外茂密青翠。西部、中部各县插秧的田已有两万多亩。西部的东方县、乐东县、儋县提前一个季节插秧，改变了过去东部插完秧，西部才动手插秧的老习惯。
    现在，海南岛投入春耕插秧的人越来越多，插秧效率也越来越高。在插秧领先的琼海县的田野里，到处是五、七人一组的作业小组，分工合作进行插秧。这个县在转入插秧大忙以后，立即把二千四百多名公社的和管理区的领导干部，层层下放到基层生产单位，参加生产，领导生产。同时又掀起了一个以提高插秧效率为目的的插秧能手运动，插秧效率提高了一倍多。
    使用改良农具是今年插秧的另一个显著特点。琼海县刚刚赶制出来的五百多部湖南醴陵式的简易插秧机，受到普遍欢迎。许许多多安装了滚珠轴承的手推车、牛车在田间来往运送肥料，人们争取在最后一次耙田之前，在每亩田已经下好底肥一千多担的基础上，再增下几百担肥料。公社的木工厂、铁工厂里一切力量，都动员起来制造各种新式农具，支援春耕插秧。
    这一切组成了一幅紧张而又秩序井然的春耕景象图。今年海南岛春耕插秧的质量远远超过去年早造。今年有一百二十六万亩基本农田深翻一尺以上，比去年深五、六寸。大部分田分层施下底肥一千多担，比去年增加五、六倍。今年插秧大部分田比去年早造密两、三倍。
