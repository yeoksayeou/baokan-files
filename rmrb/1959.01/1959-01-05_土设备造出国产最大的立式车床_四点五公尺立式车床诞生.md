Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 3rd. Shanghai Hengxin Machine Factory successfully manufactured China's first 4.5-meter vertical lathe in twenty-two days using rudimentary equipment. This lathe was test-run on the 30th of last month and performed well.

This, the largest domestically-made vertical lathe in China, is as tall as a two-story building, weighs more than sixty tons, and has a faceplate diameter of four meters. It can process large workpieces with a diameter of 4.5 meters and a weight of twenty tons. In the past, the largest vertical lathe manufactured in China was 3.4 meters. Hengxin Machine Factory's production of this 4.5-meter vertical lathe marks another step forward for China's machine tool manufacturing industry towards heavy and large-scale production.

Hengxin Machine Factory is a factory that has always produced small and medium-sized machine tools, with narrow factory buildings and no large machine tools or large cranes. The factory's employees came up with many ways to overcome difficulties in manufacturing this giant machine tool. For example, to process the faceplate blank, which weighed more than ten tons and had a diameter of four meters, they dismantled the factory and workshop gates to drag the huge faceplate blank in. Without a large lathe for processing, they devised a way to first manufacture a very simple, crude radial vertical lathe, using the method of keeping the workpiece stationary and rotating the tool for processing. They also placed the machine tool on the faceplate blank to perform drilling work.

This year, this factory will also manufacture even larger vertical lathes.

    土设备造出国产最大的立式车床
    四点五公尺立式车床诞生
    新华社上海3日电  上海恒新机器厂用土设备在二十二天中制造成功我国第一台四点五公尺立式车床。这台车床在上月30日经过试车，性能良好。
    这台我国自制的最大的立式车床，有二层楼那样高，总重量达六十多吨，花盘直径四公尺，上面可以加工直径四点五公尺，重量二十吨的大工作物。我国过去制造的最大立式车床是三点四公尺，恒新机器厂制成这一台四点五公尺立式车床标志我国机床制造工业又向重型、大型的方向跨前了一步。
    恒新机器厂是一个一直生产中小型机床的工厂，厂房狭窄，又无大机床和大吊车等设备。全厂职工在制造这台巨型机床中想了很多办法克服困难。以加工十多吨重、直径四公尺的花盘为例，他们拆掉了工厂和车间的大门，才把庞大的花盘毛坯拖了进来。没有大车床加工，他们就想法先制造一台很简单的土摇臂立车，利用工作物不动、刀转动的方式来加工。他们还把机床放在花盘毛坯上进行钻眼工作。
    今年，这个工厂还要制造更大的立式车床。
