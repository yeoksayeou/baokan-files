Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, January 22nd. At a meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission today, held at the suggestion of the U.S. side, Major General Kang Sang-ho, chief delegate of the Korean-Chinese side, sternly refuted the U.S. side's shameless assertion that the Korean-Chinese side was detaining prisoners of war, and strongly demanded that the U.S. side provide a responsible and concrete explanation regarding the list of 98,742 prisoners of war that the Korean-Chinese side had requested the U.S. side to account for.

At today's meeting, the U.S. side shamelessly demanded that the Korean-Chinese side provide an explanation for a fabricated list of prisoners of war that it presented on July 7, 1958. Major General Kang Sang-ho immediately pointed out that the U.S. side's renewed raising of the prisoner of war issue was an attempt to deceive world public opinion. However, it is the U.S. side that is detaining prisoners of war, and it is the U.S. side that bears the responsibility for providing an explanation.

Kang Sang-ho said: The Korean-Chinese side has fully fulfilled the responsibilities stipulated in the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements regarding prisoners of war. The so-called "prisoner of war list" that the U.S. side pointed out and corrected on July 7, 1958, is completely fabricated. The Korean-Chinese side has no obligation to provide any explanation for this.

Kang Sang-ho then exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy to fabricate such groundless claims to slander the Korean-Chinese side. Kang Sang-ho said that because the Korean-Chinese side had taken proactive measures, the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from Korea. However, the U.S. side not only refuses to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea but also plots to permanently occupy South Korea and frantically prepare for a new war, thus incurring unanimous condemnation from the people. Kang Sang-ho said that in order to escape from this unfavorable situation and to alleviate the condemnation of the U.S. ruling clique by the relatives of American soldiers who served as cannon fodder for the American aggressors, the U.S. side used a fabricated list to slander the Korean-Chinese side.

    美方扣留战俘不容狡赖
    朝中方面责令美方交代
    新华社板门店22日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会在美方建议下今天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上严正驳斥了美方诬指朝中方面扣留战俘的无耻论调，并且强硬要求美方对朝中方面要求美方交代的九万八千七百四十二名战俘名单作出负责的具体交代。
    美方在今天的会上无耻要求朝中方面对他在1958年7月7日提出的一份捏造的战俘名单作出交代。姜尚昊少将当即指出，美方今天又提出战俘问题，企图欺骗世界公众，但是，扣留战俘的正是美方，负有交代责任的也正是美方。
    姜尚昊说：朝中方面已经全部履行了停战协定和双方协议中规定的朝中方面关于战俘的责任，美方在1958年7月7日指出更正的所谓“战俘名单”完全是捏造出来的。朝中方面没有任何义务对此交代。
    姜尚昊接着揭露了美方制造这种无中生有的事情来诬蔑朝中方面的阴谋。姜尚昊说，由于朝中方面采取了主动措施，中国人民志愿军已全部撤出朝鲜，但是美方不但不把美军撤出南朝鲜，反而策划永久占领南朝鲜、疯狂准备新战争的阴谋，从而遭到人民一致的谴责。姜尚昊说，美方为了摆脱这种不利局面，并且想减轻充当了美国侵略者的炮灰的美国士兵的亲属对美国统治集团的谴责，因此用捏造的名单诬蔑朝中方面。
