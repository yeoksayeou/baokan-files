    Demanding a Legal Prohibition on the Import of Nuclear Weapons
    Japan Socialist Party to Launch Nationwide Campaign
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 17th: Former Japanese Prime Minister and advisor to the Socialist Party, Katayama Tetsu, said in Nara today that the Socialist Party will launch a nationwide campaign to demand a legal prohibition on the import of nuclear weapons into Japan. They will also submit a bill to the regular session of the Japanese Diet, which reconvenes on January 26th, opposing the import of nuclear weapons into Japan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 18th: The "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" recently reported that 1959 is a turning point year for Japan's military industry; in this year, Japan will vigorously develop jet military aircraft and formally begin research and manufacturing of missiles.
    The newspaper said: "Producing new types of weapons can stimulate industrial
  (production)"; Japan's own manufacturing of jet fighters will have a significant impact on the development of the aviation industry and electronics industry.
    This report in "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" reflects the current trend of Japan's monopoly capital groups: while stepping up economic expansion, they are actively developing the military industry, attempting to cope with the increasingly profound economic crisis of overproduction and preparing conditions for realizing their potential imperialist ambitions by stepping up military expansion.
    The newspaper said that Japan will vigorously manufacture parts for F86F and T33A aircraft in 1959 and 1960, with a total cost of 2.6 billion yen. New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is scheduled to produce complete F86F jet fighters in March 1960. The newspaper also said that the "Defense Agency" has established a "Missile Headquarters." Among Japanese monopoly enterprises, a group centered on Fuji Precision Company has been organized to research air-to-air missiles, a group centered on New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has been organized to research surface-to-air missiles, and a group centered on Kawasaki Aircraft has been organized to research surface-to-surface missiles.
    According to "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations’ "Defense Production Committee," a military industry organization of Japanese monopoly capital groups, has established a "Defense Industry Research Society," under which there are six departments: weapons, aviation, rocket, electronics industry, shipbuilding, and fuel. Currently, this committee is studying how to closely integrate the high development of Japanese industry with the development of the military industry, and will reach a conclusion on this issue in March of this year.
    The newspaper said that producing missiles is one of the important goals of Japan's military industry this year. After purchasing the Swiss "Oerlikon" missile, the "Defense Agency" also plans to continue purchasing the American "Sidewinder" and "Nike" missiles for research and test firing.
    "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" also revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government subsidizes these arms dealers 70 to 80 million yen annually to prevent Japanese arms dealers from being affected by the reduction of orders from the U.S. military.

    要求从法律上规定禁止运入核武器
    日本社会党将开展全国性运动
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本前内阁首相、社会党顾问片山哲今天在奈良说，社会党将展开一个全国性的运动，要求从法律上规定禁止将核武器运进日本，并且还将向在1月26日复会的日本国会平时会议提出一项关于反对把核武器运入日本的法案。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本“产业经济新闻”最近报道说，1959年是日本军火工业处于转折点的一年；在这一年中，日本将在大力发展喷气式军用飞机的同时，正规开展研究和制造导弹的工作。
    这家报纸说：“生产新型武器可以刺激工业
  （生产）”；日本自己制造喷气式战斗机将对发展航空工业和电子工业等部门发生很大作用。
    “产业经济新闻”的这项报道反映了日本垄断资本集团的当前动向：在加紧进行经济扩张的同时，积极发展军火工业，企图借以应付日益深刻化的生产过剩的经济危机，并且通过加紧扩充军备，为实现其潜在的帝国主义野心准备条件。
    这家报纸说，日本将在1959和1960年内大力制造F86F型和T33A型的飞机零件，生产这些零件的费用共达二十六亿日元。新三菱重工业公司预定在1960年3月生产完整的F86F型喷气式战斗机。报纸还说，“防卫厅”已经成立了“导弹本部”。在日本各垄断企业中，已经以富士精密公司为中心组织了研究空空导弹的集团，以新三菱重工业公司为中心组织了研究地空导弹的集团，以川崎航空公司为中心组织了研究地地导弹的集团。
    另据“日本经济新闻”透露，日本垄断资本集团的军火工业组织——日本经济团体联合会的
  “防卫生产委员会”成立了一个“防卫产业研究会”，在这个委员会下面分设武器、航空、火箭、电子工业、船舶、燃料等六个部门。目前，这个委员会正在研究如何使日本工业的高度发展和发展军事工业密切地结合起来的问题，并且将在今年3月就这个问题作出结论。
    这家报纸说，生产导弹是日本军火工业今年的重要目标之一。“防卫厅”在购买了瑞士的“厄利康”式导弹以后，还准备继续购买美国的“响尾蛇”式和“奈克”式导弹，以便进行研究和试射。
    “日本经济新闻”还透露，岸信介政府为了使日本军火商不致受到美军减少订货的影响，每年都补助这些军火商七、八千万日元。
