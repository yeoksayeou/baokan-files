By Qinghai Lake
By our correspondent Zhao Huaiqing

The water of Qinghai Lake is deep and blue, the reactionary herdowners are fierce and cunning;
The herdsmen shed blood and sweat, lacking food and clothing, enduring hardship day and night;
Parting the dark clouds to see the sun, the savior Communist Party has arrived;
Pulling the herdsmen out of hell, establishing communes and entering paradise.

This folk song circulating on the beautiful shores of Qinghai Lake vividly depicts the earth-shaking changes in the lives of the Tibetan people living here, before and after liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year.

In recent years, I have passed by Qinghai Lake three times. And this time, revisiting the old place, what lies before me is almost unrecognizable. I remember in the summer of 1955, I and two geologists stayed overnight at the home of a herdsman named Changbenjia by Qinghai Lake. In that tent that couldn't keep out the cold, Changbenjia lit the firewood, and we together envisioned a bright future for Qinghai Lake: In this vast and desolate grassland, there would be railways passing through, and there would be magnificent factories... But at that time, thinking of these things, it always felt very distant. However, only three years have passed, and the herdsmen here have already established people's communes. At the foot of the winding mountains, there is a constellation of tent villages, which are the settlements of the herdsmen. On the infinitely charming shores of Qinghai Lake, not only are there herds of fat cattle and sheep running all over the mountains and plains, but iron mines are being developed, shipyards have been built, and fishmeal factories, fish processing factories, etc. are also being built; the railway will also soon run along the shores of Qinghai Lake to the Qaidam Basin. In no time at all, Changbenjia's ideal has been realized. Now, the laboring herdsmen by Qinghai Lake are striding forward to build socialism as soon as possible.

This is the Haibin Production Corps of the Gonghe County People's Commune, and everywhere you can see groups of people engaged in collective production. The reclamation team, consisting of more than a hundred people, has already reclaimed more than 1,300 mu of land. The Tibetan herdsmen, who have never grown crops for generations, are now working day and night, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain this year. They have dug irrigation canals that are more than seventy miles long, which can irrigate more than 600,000 mu of grassland. They have also extracted some labor to go up the mountains to mine. In early winter, the gale is mixed with snow and hail, but the people still do not leave the "front line," fighting tenaciously.

However, when people are doing this, it is not all smooth sailing. In the beginning, some people with serious superstitious ideas murmured in their hearts: "If we move the earth, the mountain god will get angry, and people will suffer!" How did people answer them? "What will we eat if we don't grow crops? How can we develop industry if we don't mine? Where do cars and tractors come from? Can we build socialism by relying solely on livestock?" A series of rhetorical questions left those superstitious people speechless.

Hearing the sound of gongs, I went to the dining hall with the commune members. The people, exhausted from labor, were eating in an orderly manner under the care of waiters wearing masks and aprons. The water tank and chopping board against the wall gave people a clean and refreshing feeling. Here, the poor herdsmen are guaranteed to have meat, milk, and butter tea to eat. The dining hall is located in a newly built house. In the past, it was impossible to cook in the tent in windy and rainy weather, but now they are not afraid of any wind or rain. Soon, people will all be able to live in houses with earth and wood structures, and the elderly and children will never have to suffer from displacement again.

The dozen or so old people in the home for the elderly were the first to wear the leather jackets distributed by the commune, and they also enjoyed priority in eating meat and milk. Kangmao, an old woman in her eighties, told me: "For many years, I have been looking forward to happiness, but I didn't know what happiness tasted like, but now I have personally tasted it. This is entirely due to the good leadership of the Communist Party."

People who have not been here have imagined the life of the herdsmen by Qinghai Lake with romantic colors. However, in those long dark years, the herdsmen by Qinghai Lake suffered endless oppression and exploitation. Ma Bufang sacrificed to Qinghai Lake every August, saying that if he didn't, the lake would overflow. Under this pretext, he defrauded a large amount of money and livestock from the poor herdsmen every time. The herders worked for the herdowners in the wind and rain all year round, and could not get enough to eat or wear all year round. Some had their hands and feet chopped off by the jackal-like herdowners; some had their wives robbed. People struggled on the line of hunger and cold death from generation to generation with tears and whips. Now, the herdsmen's anger is like the tide of Qinghai Lake, drowning the arrogance of the reactionary herdowners and chieftains, and truly becoming the masters of their lives. Luo Hexun, a herdsman who was forced to leave his hometown by the reactionary herdowners for many years, has now returned to his homeland. Looking at the blue water of Qinghai Lake, he said to his fellow villagers with emotion: "What a beautiful Qinghai Lake! Sheep that drink its water don't get sick; people who live by it will have a broad mind like it. I will always follow the Communist Party and build our beautiful hometown into a paradise."

Ke Minjia, a female Communist Party member, felt that the old sheepskin coat and heavy decorations were very inconvenient when she was working. She was the first to comb her seventy-two braids into two big braids; take off the more than ten kilograms of silver ornaments hanging on her back; take off her robe and put on short clothes. In this way, the work efficiency was improved, and it was also convenient to pay attention to hygiene. She said: "The Lama told me: if you take off the silver ornaments, your husband will die. I took them off, did my husband die?" Then, people all learned from her example.

After the socialist transformation and the socialist and communist education movements, the political consciousness of the herdsmen has generally been improved. Some herdsmen said: "I believed in Buddha all my life, but in the end, I was still a pauper. The Communist Party leads us to engage in production, and only then did we have today's life." On the grassland, more and more sounds of reading have replaced the sounds of chanting scriptures. When people get sick, they go to the commune's doctor for treatment, and no longer give alms or ask Lamas to chant scriptures.

A new atmosphere is forming on the grassland. Originally, every herdsman's family kept a dog to guard against thieves, but now there is a good atmosphere of "returning lost property." Herdsman Chai Hejia picked up 90 yuan in RMB and voluntarily handed it over to the original owner. Some poor herdsmen did not have cotton clothes to wear, so everyone took the initiative to donate cloth and sheepskin coats to him. Ga Buga, an old man in his seventies, used to seeing the tragic situation of people killing each other. Comparing the past and the present, he was moved to tears. (Attached picture)

### 青海湖畔

    青海湖畔
    本报记者　赵淮青青海湖水深又蓝，反动牧主凶又奸；牧民流血又流汗，缺吃少穿日月难；拨开乌云见太阳，来了救星共产党；手拉牧民出地狱，成立公社进天堂。
    在美丽的青海湖畔流行的这首歌谣，概括地描绘了居住在这里的藏族人民，解放前后，特别是去年大跃进以来，生活上所起的翻天覆地的变化。
    几年来，我曾三次路过青海湖畔。而这次旧地重游，摆在面前的，简直是“似曾相识”了。记得1955年夏天，我和两位地质人员在青海湖畔一位叫长本加的牧民家借宿，在那顶挡不住风寒的帐房里，长本加把柴火烧起来，我们一起憧憬着青海湖美好的未来：在这辽阔荒寂的草原上，将来会有铁路通过，会有雄伟的工厂……。但那时想到这些，总感到是十分渺茫的事情。可是，时间仅仅过了三年，这儿的牧民已经建立了人民公社，在迤逦曲折的山脚下，有一片星罗棋布的帐房村房，那就是牧民们的定居点。在这无限妩媚的青海湖畔，不仅满山遍野跑着肥壮的牛羊群，而且正在开发铁矿，建起了造船厂，还要修建鱼粉厂、鱼肉加工厂等；铁路也将很快地沿着青海湖畔通向柴达木盆地。曾几何时，长本加的理想实现了。现在，青海湖畔的劳动牧民，正在大踏步地为早日建成社会主义而急步前进。
    这里是共和县人民公社海滨生产团，到处可以看见集体生产的人群。由一百多人组成的垦荒队，已经垦荒一千三百多亩。祖祖辈辈没有种过庄稼的藏族牧民，现在，正披星戴月地劳动着，争取今年粮食达到自给自足。他们挖了长达七十多里的水渠，能灌溉草原六十多万亩。还抽出一部分劳力上山采矿。初冬，狂风夹着雪雹，人们仍不下“火线”，顽强地战斗着。
    但是，人们在这样作的时候，并不是风平浪静的。初开始，有些迷信思想严重的人心里嘀咕着：“动了土，山神发威，人会遭殃的！”人们是怎样回答他们呢？“不种庄稼我们吃什么？不挖矿，怎么发展工业？汽车、拖拉机从哪里来？光靠牲畜能不能建成社会主义？”一连串的反问，问得那些迷信的人们哑口无言。
    听见锣声，我和社员们一起走进食堂。劳动疲乏了的人们，在带着口罩、系着围裙的服务员的照料下，有条不紊地就餐。靠墙的水缸、案板，给人以整洁、清爽的感觉。在这儿，贫苦牧民吃肉、吃奶子、吃酥油都有了保证。食堂是设在刚盖起的房子里。过去，刮风下雨帐房里就没法作饭，现在再大的风雨也不怕了。不久，人们就可以全部住上土木结构的房子，老人、孩子永远不再受颠沛之苦了。
    在敬老院里的十几位老人，最先穿上了公社发给他们的皮衣，肉、奶子也优先让他们享用。八十多岁的老阿奶亢毛告诉我说：“多年来盼望着幸福，不知幸福是什么滋味，现在可亲身尝到了。这完全是共产党的好领导。”
    不曾到过这里的人们，曾经带着浪漫色彩的想像，比拟着青海湖畔牧民的生活。可是，在那漫长的黑暗岁月里，青海湖畔的牧民却受尽了压榨与剥削。马匪步芳年年八月祭青海湖，说不这样湖水会溢出来的，以此为名，每次都要诈骗去贫苦牧民的大批钱财和牲畜。牧工们一年到头风里雨里为牧主放牧，终年不得温饱，有的被豺狼一样的牧主剁去手脚：有的被抢去妻子，人们伴着眼泪和皮鞭世世代代挣扎在饥寒的死亡线上。现在，牧民的愤怒就像青海湖的浪潮，淹没了反动牧主头人的气焰，真正作了生活的主人。被反动牧主逼走外乡多年的牧民洛赫逊，如今又重回故土。他望着那碧蓝的青海湖水，感慨地对乡亲们说：“多好的青海湖呵！羊喝了它的水不生病；人住在它边上，心胸就会像它一样宽阔。我要永远跟着共产党，把我们美丽的家乡建设得像天堂一样。”
    女共产党员柯民加在劳动时感到老羊皮袄和沉甸甸的装饰品很不方便，最先将七十二个小辫梳成两条大辫；摘掉挂在背上的十几斤重的银饰品；脱掉长袍，换上短装，这样，劳动效率提高了，也便于讲卫生。她说：“喇嘛跟我说：摘掉银饰品就得死丈夫，我摘了，看我的丈夫死了吗？”接着，人们都学了她的样子。
    经过社会主义改造和社会主义、共产主义教育运动以后，牧民的政治觉悟普遍有了提高，有的牧民说：“信了一辈子佛，最后还是个穷光蛋，共产党领导我们搞生产，才有了今天的生活。”在草原上，越来越多的读书声代替了念经声，人们生了病就去请公社的医生看，再也不上布施、请喇嘛念经了。
    新的风气正在草原上形成。原来每家牧民都养一条狗防贼，现在却出现了“拾金不昧”的良好风气。牧民柴禾加拾了九十元人民币，主动交给了原主。有的贫苦牧民没有棉衣穿，大家就主动给他捐布捐皮袄。七十多岁的尕布加老人，过去看惯了人们相互仇杀的惨状，今昔对比，他感动得流下了眼泪。（附图片）
