A Good Teaching Material for Workers' Study

    Currently, everyone is studying the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" and other documents passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Various newspapers and periodicals have already provided readers with some materials to assist their study. The recently published first issue of "Chinese Workers" this year devotes considerable space to publishing articles promoting the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session, and comparatively focuses on elaborating on several major contents of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes."
    In our country, the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people, and from socialism to communism, are issues of universal concern. "Talking About the Two Transitions" is an article that explains in simple terms why these two transitions are necessary, what the conditions are for realizing these two transitions, and what the relationship between these two transitions is.
    "Distribution according to need" is our ideal principle of distribution, but to implement this principle, certain conditions must be met. Without certain conditions, this ideal principle will not work. The article "Why is the 'Distribution According to Labor' System Still Implemented at Present?" discusses this issue.
    Before studying the documents, some people had some misunderstandings about the handling of means of livelihood, and heard that joining a commune meant everything would be collectivized. In fact, this is an unnecessary worry. Why did this problem arise? The article "Means of Livelihood Always Belong to Individuals" analyzes the reasons for this.
    This issue of "Chinese Workers" also expounds on the issues of being honest, opposing exaggeration, working hard, working practically, and working cleverly, as well as this year's plan for the development of China's national economy.
    After reading this issue of "Chinese Workers," readers will feel kindly that "Chinese Workers" is good teaching material for workers' study.

    工人学习的好教材
    目前大家正在学习党的八届六中全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”等文件。各个报刊已为读者提供了一些辅导学习的材料。最近出版的今年第一期“中国工人”，就以相当多的篇幅刊登了宣传六中全会精神的文章，比较集中地阐述了“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”的几项主要内容。
    在我国，从社会主义的集体所有制向社会主义的全民所有制过渡，从社会主义向共产主义过渡，这是大家普遍关心的问题。“谈谈两个过渡”，这篇文章通俗地讲解了为什么必须经过这两个过渡，实现这两个过渡的条件是什么，这两个过渡的相互关系又是怎样的。
    “按需分配”是我们理想的分配原则，但是要实行这个原则，要具备一定的条件，没有一定的条件，这个理想的原则就行不通。目前我们还要实行“按劳分配”的原则。“目前为什么还要实行‘按劳分配’制度”这篇文章就是谈这个问题的。
    在学习文件之前，有些人对生活资料的处理问题有些误解，听说入了公社要归公。其实这是不必要的顾虑。为什么会产生这个问题呢？“生活资料永远归个人所有”一文分析了这方面的原因。
    这一期“中国工人”对老老实实，反对浮夸，苦干、实干、巧干的问题以及今年我国国民经济的发展计划等也作了阐述。
    看过这一期“中国工人”，读者会亲切的感到“中国工人”是工人学习的好教材。
