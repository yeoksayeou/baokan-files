Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Upon hearing the news of the Soviet Union launching a giant cosmic rocket towards the moon, scientists in the capital enthusiastically cheered and heartily congratulated the Soviet Union on this great achievement. The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium on the afternoon of the 3rd. At the meeting, Vice President Zhu Kezhen said: We congratulate the Soviet government and people with great excitement, as this is the best New Year's gift for us. For a long time, mankind has longed to travel to the moon. The story of Chang'e flying to the moon expresses the people's hope. But mankind has never left the Earth. Now the Soviet rocket has reached the second cosmic velocity, and the road to the moon for people has been paved. The Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite in 1957, and now it has launched a cosmic rocket, which proves that the Soviet Union's rocket technology is developing extremely fast, further demonstrating that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. In terms of the speed of scientific and technological development, the distance between the Soviet Union and the United States will become greater and greater. This is a great victory for Soviet science and technology, a great victory for the Soviet Communist Party, and a great victory for the entire socialist camp.

Vice President Wu Youxun said that the speed and weight of this cosmic rocket are unprecedented in the history of science. It weighs nearly one and a half tons, which proves that Soviet science has far exceeded the level of American science. The socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world are very excited about the Soviet Union launching such a heavy cosmic rocket. Only imperialist warmongers will not be happy. This is a serious warning to them, and they must be more sober. Wu Youxun said that the launch of this cosmic rocket is the crystallization of the communist collaboration of Soviet scientists, designers, engineers, and workers, which proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Our Chinese scientists should work harder to learn from Soviet science and technology.

Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, pointed out in his speech: The cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union represents a new stage in rocket history in terms of thrust, weight, and control accuracy. If the sounding rocket is the first stage and the artificial satellite is the second stage, then the cosmic rocket is the third stage. Judging from its effective payload, the cosmic rocket requires much greater thrust than that used to propel an artificial satellite. It is by no means comparable to the American "thing"! The Soviet Union has achieved this under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, and it is the result of the labor of the Soviet people, scientists, engineers, and workers. This achievement is a blessing to all mankind and the happiness of all mankind. Guo Yonghuai, the Deputy Director, said: The launch of the cosmic rocket shows that entering the universe has reached the stage of entering the hall. On the other hand, it is also a leap in human knowledge. In the past, we could not draw conclusions about the true nature of the moon, but this time the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket will solve this problem.

Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, pointed out in his speech: Since the beginning of the International Geophysical Year, the Soviet Union has made many significant contributions, and the launch of this cosmic rocket is an even greater contribution. Judging from the instruments carried on this cosmic rocket, there are many new research projects. Soviet scientists have made a leap in science in a short period of more than a year, from launching the first artificial Earth satellite in 1957 to launching a cosmic rocket now. The reason why Soviet scientists can achieve such significant achievements is mainly due to their down-to-earth work, creative labor, and collective collaboration under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party. Cheng Maolan, Director of the Beijing Observatory Preparatory Committee, warmly congratulated the achievements of Soviet scientists and said that many new problems have recently emerged in the study of celestial bodies that need to be solved, and the use of cosmic rockets will provide valuable data for the study of these problems.

Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Academy of Sciences, said: The achievement of the Soviet Union in launching a cosmic rocket has left the United States far behind. From the launch of the cosmic rocket, we can imagine how far science can develop in the 20th century. The Soviet Union is always leading in this respect. Zhou Peiyuan, Chairman of the Chinese Physical Society, said excitedly that the achievements of Soviet scientists fully demonstrate the superiority of the Soviet socialist system, the importance of the Party's leadership, and the importance of collective strength in scientific research. Due to the irrationality of the social system, American imperialism has no way to compete with the Soviet Union in cutting-edge science and technology. Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics, said that in 1958, American rocket technology was far from catching up with the level of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite. Now the Soviet Union has launched a cosmic rocket to the moon and reached the second cosmic velocity, which proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union has leaped ahead of capitalism in just forty years. As a mathematician, we must learn from the Soviet Union and from the spirit of selfless labor of Soviet scientists.

Also speaking enthusiastically at the symposium were Yin Zanxun, Director of the Department of Geosciences, Bing Zhi, Researcher at the Institute of Zoology, Zhao Zhongyao, Deputy Director of the Institute of Atomic Energy, Zhang Zigao, Professor at Tsinghua University, Liu Dagang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Chemistry, Zhang Wenyu, Researcher at the Institute of Atomic Energy, etc. In their speeches, they praised the great achievements of the Soviet scientific community, pointed out that this was a great victory for the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people, and expressed their determination to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: This afternoon, natural science research, education, translation, and publishing units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing held a New Year's gift-giving conference. Pei Lisheng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, first announced an exciting message at the conference: the Soviet Union has launched the world's first giant cosmic rocket to the moon. The entire venue immediately burst into boiling, and more than a thousand scientific workers enthusiastically applauded the further prevalence of the East Wind over the West Wind.

President Guo Moruo then spoke at the conference. He first expressed his congratulations on the Soviet Union's launch of the giant cosmic rocket. He said: The poet's fantasy is about to become a reality, and Miss Chang'e and Old Man Wu Gang on the moon may return to Earth. In his loudest voice, he said to everyone that this is a great victory for the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people, and Soviet science and technology workers, a victory for socialism, a victory for Marxism-Leninism, and a common victory for our socialist camp. He read out his congratulatory poem entitled "Cheers for the Launch of the Giant Cosmic Rocket."

    我国科学家衷心祝贺苏联伟大创举
    同声强调加倍努力学习苏联先进科学技术
    新华社3日讯　当苏联向月球方向发射巨型宇宙火箭的消息传来后，首都的科学家热烈欢呼并衷心祝贺苏联的这一伟大成就。中国科学院在3日下午举行座谈会。会上副院长竺可桢说：我们以万分兴奋的心情来祝贺苏联政府和人民，这是给予我们新年的最好的礼物。很久以来，人类就向往去月球旅行，嫦娥奔月的故事正表达了人民的这个希望。但人类从来没有离开过地球。现在苏联火箭已达到了第二宇宙速度，人们通向月球的道路已经铺平了。苏联在1957年发射第一颗人造地球卫星，现在发射宇宙火箭，证明了苏联火箭技术发展极快，进一步表明东风压倒西风。在科学技术发展的速度方面，苏联和美国的距离将愈拉愈远。这是苏联科学技术的伟大胜利，是苏联共产党的伟大胜利，也是整个社会主义阵营的伟大胜利。
    副院长吴有训说，这个宇宙火箭的速度和重量，都是科学史上从来没有过的。它有近一吨半重，这就证明苏联科学已远远超过美国科学的水平，苏联发射了这样重的宇宙火箭，社会主义阵营和全世界的和平人民都很兴奋。只有帝国主义战争贩子不会高兴，这是对他们的一个严重警告，他们不能不清醒一些。吴有训说，这个宇宙火箭的发射，是苏联的科学家、设计师、工程师、工人的共产主义大协作的结晶，它证明了社会主义制度的无比优越。我们中国的科学家应该更努力地向苏联科学技术学习。
    力学研究所所长钱学森在发言中指出：苏联发射的这个宇宙火箭，从推力、重量和控制精确度来说，都是火箭史上的一个新阶段。如果说，探空火箭是第一阶段，人造卫星是第二阶段，那么，宇宙火箭就是第三阶段。宇宙火箭按照它的有效载重量推算起来，它要用比推动人造卫星大得多的推力。决不是美国人那个“玩意儿”可比！苏联老大哥做到这一点，这是在苏联共产党领导下，苏联人民、科学家、工程师、工人的劳动成果。这个成就是全人类的福音，是全人类的幸福。副所长郭永怀说：宇宙火箭的发射说明走向宇宙已到达登堂入室的地步。另一方面，也是人类知识的一个跃进。过去，我们对月球的真象，无法作结论，但这次苏联发射宇宙火箭，将解决这个问题。
    地球物理研究所所长赵九章在发言中指出：国际地球物理年开始以来，苏联已作出许多重大的贡献，这个宇宙火箭的发射是一个更大的贡献。从这次宇宙火箭上所带的仪器看，有许多新的研究项目。苏联科学家从1957年发射第一个人造地球卫星，到现在发射宇宙火箭，短短一年多时间，在科学上是个飞跃。苏联科学家所以能有如此重大的成就，主要是在苏联共产党的领导下踏实地工作，创造性地劳动，集体协作的结果。北京天文台筹备委员会主任程茂兰热烈祝贺苏联科学家的成就时说，在对天体的研究方面最近出现了许多新的问题有待解决，宇宙火箭的使用将为这些问题的研究获得宝贵的资料。
    科学院技术科学部主任严济慈说：苏联发射宇宙火箭的成就，把美国远远地抛在后面去了。从宇宙火箭的发射，我们可以想像，二十世纪的科学可以发展到什么程度，这方面苏联总是领先。中国物理学会理事长周培源兴奋地说，苏联科学家这样的成就，充分说明苏联社会主义制度的优越性，党的领导，科学研究工作中发挥集体力量的重要，美帝国主义由于社会制度的不合理，在尖端科学技术方面是没有办法和苏联比赛的。数学研究所所长华罗庚说，1958年，美国火箭技术远远没有赶上苏联第三颗人造卫星的水平。现在苏联又向月球发射了宇宙火箭，并达到第二宇宙速度，这证明，在共产党的领导下，苏联在短短的四十年内，已大踏步跑到资本主义的前面。作为一个数学工作者，我们要向苏联学习，向苏联科学家学习忘我劳动的精神。
    在座谈会上热烈发言的，还有地学部主任尹赞勋、动物研究所研究员秉志、原子能研究所副所长赵忠尧、清华大学教授张子高、化学研究所副所长柳大钢、原子能研究所研究员张文裕等，他们发言中赞扬苏联科学界的伟大成就，指出这是苏联共产党和苏联人民的伟大胜利，并表示将努力向苏联学习。
    新华社3日讯　中国科学院北京各自然科学研究、教育、编译出版等单位今天下午举行了元旦献礼大会。中国科学院秘书长裴丽生首先在大会上宣布了一项令人振奋的消息：苏联发射了世界上第一支飞向月球去的巨型宇宙火箭。整个会场顿时沸腾起来了，一千多个科学工作者为东风进一步压倒了西风热烈鼓掌。
    郭沫若院长接着在大会上讲话。他首先表达了对苏联发射巨型宇宙火箭的祝贺。他说：诗人的幻想就要变成现实了，月球中的嫦娥小姐和吴刚老人又可能回到地球上来了。他用最响亮的嗓音对大家说，这是苏联共产党、苏联人民和苏联科学技术工作者的伟大胜利，是社会主义的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是我们社会主义阵营共同的胜利。他宣读了他的一首题为“欢呼巨型宇宙火箭上天”的贺词。
