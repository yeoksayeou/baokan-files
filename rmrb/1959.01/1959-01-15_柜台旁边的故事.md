    Stories by the Counter
    Waiting for Good News at Midnight
    One Sunday evening, the Wuhan Pharmaceutical Wholesale Station's medicine wholesale store was quiet, with only salesman Liu Xuehong remaining at the sales counter. Suddenly, the phone rang. It turned out that the First Affiliated Hospital of Wuhan Medical College had received a worker who had been burned by molten steel, with quite serious injuries, urgently requiring four kinds of medicines: Polymyxin, plasma, bacteriophage, and hydrocortisone. However, only plasma and hydrocortisone were still in stock, and Polymyxin and bacteriophage had already sold out in Wuhan. Even though Liu Xuehong knew the market situation, he did not hesitate to reply: He would definitely find a way to supply these four medicines.
    In order to complete this arduous task, Liu Xuehong immediately made long-distance calls to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places, requesting support from fraternal pharmaceutical wholesale stations. He waited alone by the telephone, and as time passed minute by minute, his mood became increasingly heavy and anxious. It wasn't until midnight that the telephone rang one after another, telling him that Polymyxin had already been shipped from Beijing by express train; bacteriophage could also be airlifted from Shanghai to Wuhan tomorrow. Liu Xuehong breathed a sigh of relief and immediately told the hospital the good news.
    A Nylon Stocking
    One day, a customer came to the knitwear section of the Wuhan Department Store's central store. One of his new nylon stockings had a few threads pulled and a small hole. He asked the "Six Satisfactions" saleswoman Long Rongfang to help him buy a matching one. Long Rongfang thought that, in order to facilitate customers, the store could originally sell shoes, socks, gloves, pillowcases, etc., separately. However, nylon stockings were relatively expensive, so she should be more careful for the customers. Therefore, she told the customer that she was willing to help him mend the broken stocking free of charge. Under her repeated requests, the customer finally handed over the sock to her. A few days later, Long Rongfang mended the broken sock well, washed it clean, and returned it to the customer without charging a penny.
   After Work
    A customer surnamed Wei from the Northeast came to Wuhan and was strolling along Hankou Jianghan Road when he happened to fancy a purple-red tussah velvet jacket in the children's goods store. But unfortunately, he didn't have his cloth ration coupons and money with him, and he was going to leave Wuhan by train the next morning. What to do? Saleswoman Xia Furong felt a little embarrassed. But she then thought that, as a salesperson, she should find a way to satisfy customers. So she asked the customer to leave his name and address, promising to deliver the item to the hotel that night.
    That evening, after work, Xia Furong walked briskly towards the hotel. Suddenly, heavy rain poured down, she held the jacket tightly in her arms, only caring about walking towards the hotel. When she stepped into the hotel door, the clock hand was already pointing at half-past eleven. The customer was already fast asleep. But when he saw that the item Xia Furong took out of her arms was exactly the jacket he wanted to buy, he gratefully grasped Xia Furong's hand, unable to speak for a long time. (Attached picture)

    柜台旁边的故事
    午夜候佳音
    一个星期日的傍晚，武汉市医药批发站药品批发商店里静悄悄地，只有营业员刘学洪一人还留在营业柜上。突然，电话铃响起来了。原来，武汉医学院附属第一医院接到了一位被钢水烧伤的工人，伤势相当严重，急需多霉素、血浆、噬菌体和去氢考替松四种药品。可是，这几种特效药只有血浆和去氢考替松柜上还有，多霉素和噬菌体武汉市早已脱销。刘学洪明明知道市场情况，他还是毫不迟疑地答复：一定设法供应这四种药品。
    刘学洪为了完成这个艰巨的任务，立即连续挂了北京、上海、广州等地的长途电话，要求兄弟医药批发站给予支援。他独自守候在电话机旁，时间一分钟一分钟地过去，他的心情也愈来愈沉重、焦急。直到午夜，电话铃才接连地响了起来，告诉他多霉素已经从北京由快车运来；噬菌体也可以在明天由上海空运来汉。刘学洪如释重负地松了一口气，立即把这个好消息告诉了医院。
    一只尼龙袜
    一天，武汉市百货公司中心商店针织组来了一个顾客，他的一双新尼龙袜有一只抽了几根丝，破成个小洞，要求“六满意”营业员龙蓉芳替他配购一只。龙蓉芳想到，商店为了方便顾客，本来可以拆零卖鞋、袜、手套、枕套等。可是，尼龙袜的价格比较高，应该多为顾客精打细算。于是，她就告诉顾客，她愿意无代价地帮他把破袜子补好。在她再三要求下，顾客终于把袜子交给了她。几天以后，龙蓉芳把破袜补得好好的，洗得干干净净，交还给顾客，没有收取一分钱。
   下·班·以·后
    从东北来到武汉的一个姓魏的顾客，在汉口江汉路蹓跶，偶然看中了儿童用品商店一件紫红色柞丝绒夹克衫。可是不巧得很，布票和钱都没有带在身边，而第二天清晨他就要乘火车离开武汉了。怎么办呢？营业员夏芙蓉感到有点为难。但她随即又想到，作为一个营业员，应该想办法使顾客满意。于是，她请顾客留下了姓名和地址，答应他当晚把东西送到旅店去。
    这天晚上，夏芙蓉下班后，捷步如飞地向旅店走去。忽然，半途大雨倾盆，她把夹克衫紧紧地揣在怀里，只顾向旅店走去。当她踏进旅店的大门，时针已经指在十一时半。顾客早已熟睡了。但是他见到夏芙蓉从怀里拿出来的东西正是他想买的那件夹克衫时，感激得紧握着夏芙蓉的手，好久都说不出话来。（附图片）
