    Baotou Steel for the Whole Country, the Whole Country for Baotou Steel
    More Than One Hundred Construction Projects are Being Speeded Up, Partial Production Will Begin This Year
    Anshan Steel Supports the New Steel Base with a Large Number of Equipment and Personnel
    (Our newspaper, Baotou, 18th dispatch) Baotou Steel, China's third large-scale iron and steel complex being built in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, will enter the stage of simultaneous production and construction this year after more than a year of large-scale construction. It is expected to produce iron, steel, and large steel products ahead of schedule, joining the national battle to produce 18 million tons of steel.
    The construction speed of Baotou Steel in the past year has been very rapid. At the Baiyun Obo iron ore mine, the ore supply base, the concrete pouring project of the country's largest primary ore crushing plant is nearing completion. This is a huge reinforced concrete building equivalent to a twenty-story building. The part below the ground is forty meters deep, and the walls are as thick as city walls. Trains will automatically unload ore from the top of the factory along the tracks on the top of the wall, which will then be crushed by powerful crushers and sent to the ore storage tank through the belt corridor. The civil engineering of the ore storage tank was completed last year. In addition, more than ten projects have also been completed.
    The magnificent furnace body of the No. 1 large-scale automated blast furnace in the iron smelting plant can be seen from a distance. Before the New Year, workers had completed the installation of the 40-meter-high blast furnace shell and the furnace bodies of the three large hot blast stoves. The installation of the furnace top will begin as soon as the furnace top equipment arrives. Molten iron will be sent directly to the large steelmaking plant. At present, the foundation of the first "king of open-hearth furnaces" and the foundation of the first molten iron furnace capable of holding 1,300 tons of molten iron have been completed. Workers are also tying reinforcing steel in the foundation pit of the steelmaking workshop, which is more than a mile long. The earthwork of the primary rolling mill and the large rolling mill has also begun. The first large coke oven with an annual output of 500,000 tons in the coking chemical plant has been completed half a year ahead of schedule and is being baked, and coke will be produced around the Spring Festival. The refractory brick workshop of the refractory material plant has begun trial production. The general machine repair plant, composed of seven tall workshops, was put into production in the first half of last year.
    Thousands of workers in charge of Baotou Steel's water source project have eliminated various obstacles of nature and subdued underground quicksand. At present, the main part of the project has been basically completed, and water will be supplied in the early second quarter of this year.
    According to the responsible comrades of the Baotou Municipal Party Committee and the Baotou Steel Party Committee, with the care of the Party and the strong support of all parties, Baotou Steel has laid a preliminary foundation in the past few years. This year is a decisive year for the construction of Baotou Steel. The annual investment is more than one and a half times larger than in 1958. Twenty system projects will continue to be constructed and started, including more than one hundred engineering projects. The Baiyun Obo iron ore mine, iron smelting blast furnace, steelmaking open-hearth furnace, coking plant, primary rolling mill, large rolling mill, and water supply, power supply, and other projects will be completed or partially completed this year, and efforts will be made to produce iron, steel, and large steel products ahead of schedule.
    Based on several years of construction practice, the following specific issues must be well resolved.
    First, the issue of materials and equipment. The construction of Baotou Steel is in a region with a weak original industrial base, and there is no larger industrial city nearby to rely on. In the past few years, except for local building materials, all major materials and equipment have mainly relied on supplies from all over the country. Now that the local industry in Baotou has developed and conditions have changed somewhat, the local area still cannot meet the needs due to the large quantity and variety of materials and equipment required for the construction of Baotou Steel. Therefore, in addition to the materials and equipment allocated by the state, it is also hoped that cities and brother factories and mines will give strong support to Baotou Steel.
    Second, the issue of collaboration. The construction of a large-scale iron and steel base requires the corresponding development of electricity, coal, railways, and other aspects. At present, a large thermal power plant, a large coal base, and the construction of railways dedicated to Baotou City and Baotou Steel are all under large-scale construction. When Baotou Steel is about to be put into production, these brother units need to work together, promote each other, and keep pace in the construction progress to fight for steel.
    Third, the issue of the production and construction team. From construction to production, Baotou Steel needs a workforce of hundreds of thousands of people with both a high degree of political awareness and modern scientific and technological knowledge. In the past few years, thanks to the support from all over the country and the practical training in complex and arduous projects, a strong team has been initially formed. Many farmers and Mongolian herders who joined the factory less than a year or two ago have become skilled technicians. However, this growing team is still not compatible with the construction scale this year in terms of labor and technical strength. It is still necessary for all parts of the country and brother enterprises to give more, greater, and better support, to transport technical strength, and to encourage young people to participate in the construction of Baotou Steel.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel will continue to exert the great power of the old iron and steel base, and support the production and construction of the two new bases, Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel, with a large amount of steel, equipment, and personnel.
    The first batch of 640 tons of steel, including medium steel plates, thin steel plates, and seamless steel pipes, which Anshan Iron and Steel supported Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel this year, has been shipped out in the first half of the new year. The quality of these steel products is first-class, and the varieties are diverse. In the past year, Anshan Iron and Steel supported more than 50,000 tons of various steel products for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel; at the same time, it also supported a batch of reducers, slag pots, lubricators, furnace top pulleys, and other equipment for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel.
    The first batch of more than 7,000 workers from various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel who will support Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel this year will depart before the Spring Festival. At present, various factories and mines are preparing to transfer employees. In the past two years, Anshan Iron and Steel's factories and mines have supported a total of more than 10,000 cadres and workers for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel. From company managers to construction site directors, from factory and mine directors to section chiefs, from engineers to technicians, those who smelt iron, steel, and roll steel are all available, and they have now become the backbone of the production and construction of Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel. Since the New Year, various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel have also adopted measures such as masters teaching apprentices, opening training courses, and actual operation to accelerate the training of workers for Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel.

    包钢为全国全国为包钢
    一百多个工程项目加紧建设，今年将局部投入生产
    鞍钢以大量设备和人材支援新的钢铁基地
    本报包头18日电　建设在内蒙古自治区的我国第三个大型钢铁联合企业——包钢，经过一年多的大规模施工，今年就要进入边生产边建设的阶段，提前出铁、出钢、出大型钢材，参加国家生产一千八百万吨钢的战斗序列。
    包钢一年来的建设速度是很快的。在矿石供应基地——白云鄂博铁矿山，一座全国最大的矿石初破碎厂混凝土浇灌工程已快完成了。这是一个相当于二十层楼高的庞大的钢筋混凝土建筑，地面以下的部分深达四十公尺，墙壁像城墙一样厚，火车将沿着墙顶上的轨道从厂顶上自动把矿石卸下，经过效率强大的破碎机破碎，再通过皮带通廊送到贮矿槽。贮矿槽的土建工程已经在去年完成。此外还有十多项工程也都建成。
    炼铁厂第一号大型自动化高炉雄伟的炉体从很远就可看到。新年以前，工人们已把四十公尺高的高炉外壳和三座大热风炉的炉体安装完毕，只等高炉炉顶设备一到，炉顶的安装就要开始。铁水将直接送往大型炼钢厂。现在炼钢厂的第一座“平炉王”基础，和第一座能容纳一千三百吨铁水的混铁炉的基础已经作好了，工人们还正在一里多长的炼钢车间的基础坑里，绑扎钢筋。初轧厂和大型轧钢厂的土方工程也已经开始了。焦炭化学厂第一座年产五十万吨的大型焦炉已经提前半年建成，并正在烘炉，春节前后就要出焦。耐火材料厂的耐火砖车间已开始了试生产。由七个高大的车间组成的机修总厂去年上半年就投入了生产。
    负担包钢水源工程的数千职工，扫除了大自然的种种障碍，制服了地下流沙。现在，工程的主要部分已基本完成，今年第二季度初就要通水。
    据中共包头市委和包钢党委的负责同志谈，包钢在党的关怀和各方面的大力支援下，几年来已经打下了一个初步基础。今年是包钢建设决定性的一年，全年投资比1958年大一倍半以上，有二十个系统工程继续施工和开工，其中包括一百多个工程项目。白云鄂博铁矿山、炼铁高炉、炼钢平炉、焦化厂、初轧厂、大型轧钢厂，以及供水、供电等工程，今年都要建成或部分建成，争取提前出铁、出钢、出大型钢材。
    根据几年的建设实践，有以下几个具体问题必需很好解决。
    第一，材料设备问题。包钢建设在一个原有工业薄弱的地区，就近没有较大工业城市作为依托。过去几年，除地方性的建筑材料外，一切主要材料设备，主要依靠全国各地供应。现在由于包头市的地方工业有了发展，条件有了一些变化，但由于包钢建设需要的材料设备，数量大，品种多，当地仍不能满足需要。因此，除了国家调拨的材料设备外，还希望各城市、各兄弟厂矿给包钢以大力支援。
    第二，协作问题。一个大型钢铁基地的建设，需要有电力、煤炭、铁道等方面的建设相应发展。目前，一个大型热电站、一个较大的煤炭基地和包头市及包钢专用的铁路建设，都在大规模施工。当包钢临近投入生产的时候，更需要这些兄弟单位协同动作，互相促进，在建设进度上步调一致，为钢而战。
    第三，生产建设的队伍问题。包钢从建设到生产，需要一支数以十万计的，既有高度政治觉悟又有现代科学技术知识的职工队伍。几年来，由于全国各地的支援和在复杂艰巨的工程中的实际锻炼，已经初步形成一支坚强的队伍。许多入厂不到一两年的农民和蒙古族牧民，变成了熟练的技术工人。但是，这支正在成长的队伍，在劳动力方面和技术力量方面，同今年的建设规模比起来，还是显得不相适应。还需要全国各地和兄弟企业，给以更多更大和更好的支援。输送技术力量，鼓舞青年参加包钢建设。
    新华社鞍山18日电　今年，鞍钢将继续发挥老钢铁基地的巨大威力，以大量的钢材、设备和人材，支援包钢和武钢两个新基地的生产建设。
    鞍钢今年第一批支援包钢和武钢的中钢板、薄钢板、无缝钢管等钢材六百四十吨，已经在新年头半个月内运出。这些钢材的质量是头等的，品种是多样的。过去的一年中鞍钢支援包钢和武钢两地的各种钢材有五万多吨；同时，还支援了包钢和武钢一批减速机、铁渣罐、给油器、炉顶绳轮等设备。
    鞍钢各厂矿今年支援包钢和武钢两地的七千多工人，第一批将在春节前出发。现在各厂矿正在进行抽调职工的准备工作。过去两年中，鞍钢各厂矿支援包钢和武钢的干部和工人共有一万多人。从公司经理到工地主任，从厂矿长到工段长，从工程师到技术工人，炼铁的、炼钢的、轧钢的应有尽有，现在都已成为包钢、武钢生产建设中的骨干力量。新年以来，鞍钢各厂矿还采取师傅带徒弟、开训练班和实际操作等措施，加速为包钢、武钢培养工人。
