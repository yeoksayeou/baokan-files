Louis Braille, Creator of the Braille System

    January 4, 1959, marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Louis Braille, the creator of the Braille system. The Braille system is the most comprehensive, common, and convenient tactile writing system, enabling the blind to access the entirety of humanity's spiritual and cultural treasures. However, few know the life and deeds of this genius. Few also know the difficulties he overcame and the many years it took for his invention to reach the blind of all nations. Bourgeois society has no interest in inventions that cannot generate commercial profit. Braille died an unrecognized inventor, and it was not until more than thirty years after his death that Braille was universally recognized.

    Louis Braille was born on January 4, 1809, in Coupvray, near Paris, to a poor saddle maker. At the age of three, he injured his eyes with a saddle knife while playing in his father's workshop, which eventually led to complete blindness.

    In 1819, at the age of ten, Louis Braille entered the Royal Institution for Blind Youth in Paris. This school was a welfare institution in the form of an orphanage, with poor material conditions. Most students were thin and malnourished, and Braille could hardly escape his tragic fate, contracting tuberculosis at the age of twelve.

    The school instilled useless abstract knowledge in its students, and the teaching method was entirely oral. The school library contained only fourteen textbooks, mostly grammar books, with no arithmetic textbooks. Braille was one of the most gifted students in the school; he excelled in his general subjects and was also an excellent cellist and organist.

    Braille wanted to study history, literature, and other subjects, but there were no books available for reading. He wanted to become a musician, but there was no specialized music theory for the blind to learn. Perhaps for these reasons, Braille began to consider creating a braille system from the age of sixteen. In 1829, Braille first suggested that the committee of the Royal Institution for Blind Youth examine the braille system he had created. He had already graduated and was teaching at the institution at the time. However, the sighted teachers at the institution strongly opposed the braille system he had created, believing that the Barbier system of tactile writing was sufficient. The Barbier system was a phonetic script that could not represent French letters. Braille's proposed braille system was thus rejected.

    However, the superiority of Braille's braille system could not be denied. This braille system is based on six dots, which can generate sixty-three variations, creating a complete French alphabet. It is easy for the blind to read by touching with their fingers. The six raised dots can also be written with a special tool—a copper ruler and awl; braille books can also be printed by machine. Braille also created complete mathematical and musical notations based on the six-dot braille system, thus providing the blind with the most important and reliable key to accessing all the valuable treasures of human wisdom. However, Braille's great contribution to the blind was buried for nearly ten years, until 1838, when the world's first braille book was published using the Braille system. At the International Congress of Teachers of the Blind held in Berlin in 1879, it was decided that all schools for the blind would teach using the Braille system. In 1887, the Braille system was internationally recognized, thirty-five years after Braille's death.

    The Braille system is now widely used in countries around the world, and national braille systems have been formed based on it. China's braille system is also based on these six-dot symbols. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    盲字符号创造者路易·布莱尔
    1959年1月4日是盲字符号创造者路易·布莱尔诞生一百五十周年纪念日。布莱尔盲字，是包罗万象的最普通最方便的凸凹标点盲字，它使盲人能够获得人类精神文化的全部珍物。但是人们很少知道这位天才人物的生活和事迹。也很少有人知道他发明盲字曾经冲破了多少困难，经历了多少年代才同各国盲人见面的。资产阶级社会，对不能获得商业利润的发明是根本不感兴趣的。布莱尔在去世时是一个不被承认的发明家，直到他去世三十多年后，盲字才得到世界各国的公认。
    路易·布莱尔1809年1月4日生于巴黎附近库普弗莱城一个贫穷的手工马鞍匠家中。他三岁那年，由于在父亲作坊中玩马鞍刀刺伤了眼睛，以后他的双眼就完全丧失了视力。
    1819年，路易·布莱尔十岁那年，进入巴黎盲人学院。这个学校是一个孤儿院形式的福利机关，物质条件很坏，大多数学生骨瘦如柴，营养不足，布莱尔也难以摆脱自己的悲惨命运，十二岁就得了肺结核病。
    这个学校对学生灌输毫无用处的抽象知识，教学方法完全用口语，学院图书馆里一共只有十四本教科书，大部分是语法，没有一本算术课本。布莱尔是学校中最有天才的学生之一，他的普通课目成绩很好，大提琴和大风琴也弹得很出色。
    布莱尔很想研究历史、文学及其他科目，可是没有可供阅读的书籍，他很想成为音乐家，可是没有可供盲人学习的专门乐理。大概因为这些缘故，布莱尔从十六岁起就考虑创造盲文。1829年布莱尔第一次建议巴黎盲人学院委员会审查他创造的盲字，当时他已毕业，在该院任教员。可是学院的明眼教师竭力反对他创造的盲字，他们认为当时采用的巴比埃盲字发音法就已足够了。巴比埃盲字是一种发音文字，不能代表法文字母。布莱尔提出的盲字就这样被否定了。
    但是布莱尔盲字符号的优越性是否定不了的。这种盲字符号以六个点为基础，由此而产生六十三个变化，创造出完整的法国字母表。盲人用手指触摸，阅读起来很方便。六个凸字也可以用一种特制的工具——铜尺和锥子写出来；还可以用机器印出盲文书籍。布莱尔还以六点盲字符号为基础，编制了完整的数学符号和音乐符号，从而使盲人得到了获取人类智慧方面一切宝贵财产的最重要和最可靠的钥匙。但是布莱尔对盲人的这种巨大贡献，却一直被埋没了将近十年，到1838年才用布莱尔盲字符号出版了世界上第一本盲文书籍。1879年在柏林举行的国际盲人教师代表大会上，决定所有盲人学校都以布莱尔盲字符号进行教学。1887年，布莱尔盲字符号才得到国际上的承认，那时离布莱尔逝世已有三十五年了。
    现在世界各国已普遍采用这种盲字符号，并且据此组成了各国的盲字体系。我国盲字也是根据这六点符号组成的。　（新华社）（附图片）
