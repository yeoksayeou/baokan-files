　　Now, all localities are grasping the work of complete equipment production. To have complete equipment, factories must be "complete." Many relatively large-scale equipment projects often require joint production by factories in several regions, and to achieve "completeness" on a national scale, it is necessary to strengthen coordination between regions and enterprises.

　　Some regions with a relatively good mechanical industry foundation may encounter some "gaps" in the process of manufacturing complete sets of equipment. That is to say, most of a set of equipment can now be manufactured, but a small part cannot be manufactured. What to do? Taiyuan's experience is: seize the construction of "gap" industries. Some of them are projects that the state has already determined, and now we must seize the construction; some are to add some necessary equipment to old factories to allow them to produce this type of "gap" goods. There is another way, which is to organize mechanical factories to trial-produce and produce new products.

　　Taiyuan's spirit of actively promoting complete sets of equipment is very good, and it has also gained some experience. This experience can be used as a reference for regions with similar conditions.

### 补“缺门”

    补“缺门”
    现在，各地都在抓设备成套生产的工作。要设备成套就要工厂“成套”。不少比较重大的设备，常常要由几个地区的工厂共同生产，要在全国范围内“成套”，这就需要加强地区之间、企业之间的协作。
    有的机械工业基础较好的地区，在制造成套设备的过程中，会遇到部分“缺门”。就是说，一套设备的绝大部分现在都能制造，但还有一小部分造不出来。怎么办？太原提供的经验是：抓紧建设“缺门”工业。其中一部分是国家早已确定的项目，现在要抓紧建设；一部分是给老厂增添一点必要的设备，让它来生产这类“缺门”货。还有另外一个办法，就是组织机械厂试制和生产新产品。
    太原积极促进设备成套的精神很好，也摸到一些经验，这些经验可供条件类似的地区参考。
