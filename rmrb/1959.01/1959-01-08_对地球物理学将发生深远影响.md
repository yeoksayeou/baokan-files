    The Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial planet through the lunar region. This is a new era of interplanetary travel and a new peak of human civilization.
    Launching an artificial planet through the lunar region has great scientific significance. Its impact on various disciplines will be extremely profound. In terms of geophysics, the scientific information sent back by artificial planets passing through the vicinity of the moon is extremely valuable. Among them, data on interplanetary meteor particles and the gas composition of interstellar matter will be of great help to our research on scientific issues such as the formation of the lunar surface layer, whether there is an atmosphere on the moon, and the nature of the lunar atmosphere. Mankind is at the bottom of the atmosphere. On the surface of the earth, many natural phenomena are blocked or transformed by this layer of atmosphere, preventing us from observing and understanding these natural phenomena. In addition, due to the influence of the Earth's magnetic field, many charged particles from the sun and the universe are restrained by the Earth's magnetic field, making it impossible for us to study them. Soviet scientists have obtained major new discoveries from the scientific data obtained from three artificial satellites in the fields of cosmic rays, micrometeorites, and solar particulate radiation. These new discoveries undoubtedly have great significance for the research of basic scientific theories and practical applications. However, the altitude that artificial satellites can reach is still very limited for interstellar travel. The inability to obtain the most critical data for space travel tools and human survival, such as the distribution of interstellar meteor particles and heavy nuclei of cosmic rays, is still a major shortcoming for carrying out interstellar travel. The data obtained by the artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union this time is extremely important for the design of spacecraft and how to take measures to protect human safety during flight. Finally, due to the exploration of artificial planets, the close relationship between the Earth and other planets in the solar system may be better understood. Geophysics will accelerate its integration with solar system astronomy and solar physics, forming many new frontier sciences, finding many new growth points in academic development, which will greatly promote the development of geophysics. In short, the first artificial planet launched through the lunar region will have a more profound impact on geophysics than artificial Earth satellites, and its impact is currently difficult to fully estimate.
    The scientific achievement of launching the first artificial planet, which is full of profound significance, is a great crystallization of human wisdom. It requires more precise advanced technology and a greater amount of outstanding scientific labor than launching an artificial Earth satellite. This requires unified and strong leadership, a huge collective, and the ability to give full play to collective wisdom in order to successfully complete this huge task. This can only be effectively organized and successful in a socialist Soviet Union with a high level of culture and economy. In fact, as early as when the first artificial Earth satellite was launched, the Soviet Union had already made many necessary preparations for launching space rockets. In the United States, as Dr. Pielinger, an American rocket expert, said, the United States, despite exhausting the strength of its army, navy, and air force, is still far from being able to complete such a task. Their attempts in this regard are "trying to run before they have learned to walk."
    This new great achievement of the Soviet Union also shows how tirelessly the Soviet Union is working to reveal the secrets of the universe, for the high development of science and culture, and for seeking a peaceful and happy life for mankind. The United States is only focused on aggression and serving aggression. Military spending is increasing year by year, and their rocket and artificial satellite work is also for military purposes. The American warmongers are already talking about the strategic significance of the moon and occupying the moon when launching space rockets to the moon is far from practically possible. They are even crazy enough to auction off land on the moon, wanting to contaminate other planets with their dirty exploitation system. The successful launch of the Soviet lunar rocket once again proves that these crazy activities of the United States are futile. The imperialist camp is rotting day by day, while our socialist camp is getting better day by day. This is another living proof. The bright future belongs to us.

    对地球物理学将发生深远影响
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长　赵九章
    苏联成功地通过月球地区发射了第一个人造行星。这是星际航行的一个新纪元，人类文明的新高峰。
    通过月球地区发射人造行星有着极大的科学意义。它对各种学科的影响将是极其深远的。在地球物理学方面来说，人造行星通过月球附近地区所发回的科学情报是极其珍贵的。其中如行星际流星粒子及星际物质的气体成份资料，将对我们研究月球表面层的形成、月球上是否有大气存在以及月球大气的性质等科学问题有极大的帮助。人类处于大气的底部。在地球表面上，许多自然现象都被这一层大气所阻隔或者被它所转化，使我们不能观测了解这些自然现象。此外，由于地球磁场的影响，许多由太阳及宇宙而来的带电粒子都因地磁场的牵引制动，使我们无法对它们进行研究。苏联科学家从三次人造卫星所得到的科学资料，在宇宙线、微流星、太阳微粒辐射等方面都已获得了重大的新发现。这些新的发现，无疑地对于基本科学理论的研究以及实际应用都有重大意义。但是，人造卫星所能达到的高度对于星际航行来说还是很有限的。对宇宙航行工具及人类生存最关紧要的资料如星际流星粒子、宇宙线重原子核的分布不能获得，这对于开展星际航行还是很大的缺陷。这次苏联发射出的人造卫星所获得的关于这方面的资料，对于宇宙飞船的设计以及如何采取保护人类在飞行中安全的措施是极其重要的。最后，由于人造行星的探测，地球与太阳系中别的星球的密切关系就可能了解得更清楚、地球物理学将加速地与太阳系天文学与太阳物理打成一片，形成许多新的边缘科学，找出许多学术发展上的新的生长点，这会大大的促使地球物理学的发展。总之，通过月球地区发射的第一个人造行星将比人造地球卫星对地球物理学起着更深远的影响，它的影响目前还难于完全估计出来。
    发射第一个人造行星这样一个富有深刻意义的科学成就，是人类智慧的伟大结晶。它比发射人造地球卫星要求有更精密的高度技术、更大量的出色的科学劳动。这需要有统一的强有力的领导，一个巨大的集体，并能发挥高度的集体智慧，才能很好地完成这一巨大的工作。这也只有在社会主义的、有高度文化和经济水平的苏联才能有效地组织成功。事实上，早在发射第一颗人造地球卫星的时候，苏联已经对发射宇宙火箭作了许多必要的准备。而在美国，正如美国火箭专家皮临格博士所说，美国在这方面尽管穷海陆空三军之力，目前还远不能完成这样的任务，他们在这方面的尝试是“还没有学会走路，就想跑步了”。
    苏联这一个新的伟大成就也说明了苏联为了揭露宇宙的秘密、为了科学文化的高度发展、为了给人类谋取和平幸福的生活，是如何不倦地努力着。而美国一心只想侵略、一切为侵略服务，军费一年年的增长，他们的火箭和人造卫星的工作也是为军事服务的。美国的战争狂人在向月球发射宇宙火箭还远没有实际可能的时候就在大谈什么月球的战略意义和占领月球了。甚至疯狂到拍卖月球上的土地，想把他们的肮脏的剥削制度来沾污别的星球。苏联月球火箭的成功发射，又一次证明美国这种疯狂的活动是徒劳的。帝国主义阵营在一天天烂下去，而我们社会主义阵营一天天的好起来，这又是活生生的证明。光辉的未来是属于我们的。
