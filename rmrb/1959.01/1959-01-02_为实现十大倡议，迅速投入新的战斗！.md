Comrades, Representatives:

Our conference is about to close today. This conference has been very enthusiastic and successful. Thanks to the direct guidance of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the kind concern of Chairman Mao, and the joint efforts of all comrades, this conference has now smoothly completed its tasks.

During the conference, we heard the important instructions given by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the political report by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the thematic reports on industry, agriculture, finance and trade, culture and education, and health. All these instructions and reports have given us all representatives great inspiration and encouragement; we must strive to embody the spirit of these instructions and reports in our future practical work.

During the conference, many comrades made excellent speeches. In their speeches, they introduced the work of their regions and units, shared many useful experiences, and put forward development plans for further building their regions and units in a more beautiful way. Through their speeches, we have seen more clearly the correctness of the various policies implemented by the Party in the countryside, so that we will work more confidently to achieve the tasks for the new year. During the conference, all comrades also seriously studied the Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and other relevant documents. After studying and discussing these documents, our future direction of efforts has become clearer, and our thinking has been further improved. Our enthusiasm will be greater, and our work will definitely be done better.

Comrades, our conference is a conference full of revolutionary enthusiasm and a conference that adheres to the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. We must fully carry forward the spirit of the conference and bring it to all parts of the country and implement it in all our work. It must be seen that right-leaning conservative thinking cannot be solved all at once, and such thinking will emerge again at the slightest sign of trouble; at the same time, the formalism and commandism styles of exaggeration will inevitably still occur in future work. Therefore, we must always remain vigilant, never be complacent, and should, based on the principle of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit, wage unremitting struggle against these harmful tendencies and styles in our work.

Based on the spirit of the conference, after full discussion, all representatives unanimously adopted the Ten Initiatives proposed to the people's communes and all peasant brothers and sisters throughout the country. All these initiatives are necessary guarantees for striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the new year. All these initiatives are practical and feasible. We believe that the rural people's communes and all peasant brothers and sisters throughout the country will actively respond to these initiatives and will surely use their practical actions to realize these initiatives.

Comrades! We will soon be returning to our original work posts. After returning, we should promote the spirit of this conference to the broad masses of the people, and under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, conscientiously implement the Ten Initiatives proposed by the conference. After returning, we should quickly throw ourselves into the new battle, conscientiously do a good job in the current work of rectification and consolidation of people's communes, do a good job in the field management of overwintering crops, carry out winter water conservancy and winter manure accumulation campaigns, do a good job in winter sideline production, actively develop the rural patriotic health campaign, and vigorously carry out rural cultural and educational work. In all these works, all of us comrades should continue to play our leading and backbone roles. There is no doubt that after this conference, we will march more uniformly towards the goals indicated by the Party and advance victoriously.

    为实现十大倡议，迅速投入新的战斗！
    中共中央书记处书记谭震林在全国农业先进单位代表会议上的闭幕词各位代表，各位同志：
    我们的大会今天就要闭幕了。这次大会开得很热烈，很成功。这次大会，由于党中央和国务院的直接指导，由于毛主席的亲切关怀，由于全体同志的共同努力，现在它已经顺利地完成了自己的任务。
    会议期间，我们听到了刘少奇同志代表党中央对大会所作的重要指示，听到了周恩来总理的政治报告，听到了有关工业、农业、财贸、文教和卫生等方面的专题报告。所有这些指示和报告，给了我们全体代表以极大的启示和鼓舞；我们一定把这些指示和报告的精神努力体现到今后的实际工作中去。
    会议期间，许多同志都作了很好的发言。他们在发言中介绍了本地区、本单位的工作情况，介绍了许多有益的经验，并且提出了进一步把本地区、本单位建设得更加美好的发展规划。通过他们的发言，我们更清楚地看到了党在农村中所实行的各项政策的正确，从而我们将更加满怀信心地为实现新的一年的工作任务而努力。会议期间，全体同志还认真地学习了党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议和其它有关文件。经过对这些文件的学习和讨论，我们今后的努力方向更加明确了，思想更加提高了。我们的干劲将会更足，工作一定会做得更好。
    同志们，我们的大会，是一个充满了革命热情的大会，是一个坚持实事求是的科学精神的大会。我们必须把大会的精神充分地发扬起来，把它带到全国各地和贯彻到各项工作中去。必须看到，右倾保守思想不是一下子可以解决的，一有风吹草动，这种思想又会钻出来；同时，浮夸的形式主义作风和命令主义作风，在今后的工作中，免不了也还会发生。因此，我们必须经常保持警惕，决不能麻痹大意，并且应该根据革命热情和科学精神相结合的原则，来同工作中的这些有害的倾向和作风，进行不懈的斗争。
    根据大会的精神，经过充分的讨论，全体代表一致通过了向全国各地农村人民公社和全体农民兄弟姊妹提出的十大倡议。所有这些倡议，都是为争取在新的一年里实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进的必要保证。所有这些倡议，都是切实可行的。我们相信，全国各地农村人民公社和全体农民兄弟姊妹，一定会积极地响应这些倡议，并且一定会用自己的实际行动来实现这些倡议。
    同志们！我们很快地就要分别回到原有的工作岗位上去了。回去以后，我们应该向广大群众很好地宣传这次大会的精神，应该在各级党委的领导下，认真地贯彻执行大会所提出的十大倡议。在回去以后，我们应该迅速地投入新的战斗，切实地做好当前的整顿和巩固人民公社的工作，做好越冬作物的田间管理工作，开展冬修水利和冬季积肥运动，搞好冬季的副业生产，积极地发展农村爱国卫生运动，大力地进行农村的文化教育工作。在所有这些工作中，我们全体同志，都应该继续发挥自己的带头作用和骨干作用。毫无疑问地，经过这次大会，我们将更加步伐整齐地向着党所指示的目标胜利前进。
