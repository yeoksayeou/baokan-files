Grasping short-distance transportation is an important link in accelerating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

Work is always interlinked. In the commodity circulation process, we must grasp both procurement and processing, as well as transportation. In transportation, long-distance and short-distance transportation must be closely linked. If the trains and trucks responsible for long-distance transportation cannot promptly transport the goods out of the stations, backlogs will form; however, if short-distance transportation cannot keep up, and the trains and trucks cannot leave fully loaded, it will also waste transportation capacity. As a result, neither can accelerate the exchange of materials.

Generally speaking, short-distance transportation is relatively easy to handle. Therefore, it is also relatively easy to be overlooked. Here, we remind Party committees in various regions to pay attention to preventing the disconnection between short-distance and long-distance transportation in material exchange. As long as Party committees in various regions pay attention to this issue, transportation capacity can be brought into full play, and goods can flow more rapidly.

### 长途、短途运输一齐抓

    长途、短途运输一齐抓
    抓短途运输，是加速城乡物资交流的一个重要环节。
    工作总是一环套一环的。商品流通过程中，既要抓采购、加工，又要抓运输。在运输中，长途运输和短途运输又必须紧密衔接。担负长途运输任务的火车、汽车，如果不能把车站的物资及时运出去，就要形成积压；但是，如果短途运输赶不上，火车、汽车来了不能满载而去，也会浪费运输力量。结果都不能加速物资交流。
    短途运输一般说来比较容易办。因此，也比较容易被忽视。我们在这里提醒一下各地党委，注意防止在物资交流中发生短途运输和长途运输脱节的现象。只要各地党委注意了这个问题，运输力量就更能充分发挥作用，货物就更能迅速畅流了。
