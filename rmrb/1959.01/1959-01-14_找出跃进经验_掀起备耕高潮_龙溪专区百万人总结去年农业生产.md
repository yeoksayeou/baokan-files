Xinhua News Agency report: The Longxi Prefecture in Fujian Province has a million cadres and masses who, combined with winter production, have summarized the achievements and experiences of last year's great leap forward in agricultural production through discussions, debates, comparisons, reminiscences, detailed accounting, and on-site visits. Through the summary, people have even greater confidence and enthusiasm in striving for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

Last year, Longxi Prefecture achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in both industry and agriculture. The unit yield of grain more than doubled, and there was also great development in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production. In the summaries of various places, vivid facts were used to further demonstrate that putting politics in command, liberating thought, and resolutely implementing the Party's General Line are the fundamental guarantees for a bumper harvest in agriculture. When transplanting late rice last year, some people in the Xincuo Brigade of the Red Flag People's Commune in Haicheng County once emphasized that the soil quality and water conservancy conditions were not good, and it was impossible to leap forward, saying that "a castrated chicken cannot fly with a phoenix." However, under the leadership of the Party, this production brigade resolutely mobilized the masses, relied on the masses to build two reservoirs and dig many level ponds. They also improved the soil by carrying sand and accumulating fertilizer, and carried out rational close planting. As a result, the yield of late rice per mu was 1,830 jin, an increase of more than six times compared with 1957. When the farmers summarized this time, they said: "With the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, we can fly like a phoenix." Farmer Lan Qingshan used dialectics to analyze last year's leap forward experience, saying: Those who dare not leap forward look at new things with old eyes, only see the dead fields, but do not see the living people. With the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, coupled with hard work, hard work, and clever work, low yields can be transformed into high yields.

Cadres consulting with the masses on matters, cooperating closely, and uniting as one, coupled with necessary measures and technologies, will surely strive for a bumper harvest in everything. This is the most profound experience gained by all parts of the region. The Jiuzhou Brigade in Yunxiao County became a county-wide high-yield red flag because it resolutely believed in the Party's words and resolutely followed the mass line. Every time a new measure was implemented, the cadres would consult with the old farmers in advance, let the masses discuss it, and if everyone agreed, they would do it quickly and well.

In terms of production increase measures, the masses used their own personal experience to explain from all aspects that if they act according to the "Eight-Character Charter," they will definitely increase production every year. They believe that the "Eight-Character Charter" is a whole that is interconnected and mutually promoting. When implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and proceed from the specific.

Through the summary, the cadres and masses of the entire prefecture have become more confident in striving for a greater leap forward this year. At present, the people's communes in the prefecture are carrying out the rectification movement of the people's communes and the winter production movement on the basis of summarizing experience.

    找出跃进经验　掀起备耕高潮
    龙溪专区百万人总结去年农业生产
    据新华社讯　福建省龙溪专区有一百万干部和群众，结合冬季生产，通过鸣放辩论、评比、回忆、算细账和现场参观，总结了去年农业生产大跃进的成就和经验。通过总结，人们争取今年更大更全面跃进的信心更高，干劲更足。
    去年，龙溪专区工农业生产都获得了空前大丰收。粮食单位面积产量翻了一番多，林业、牧业、副业和渔业生产也都有很大发展。各地在总结中，都以活生生的事实，进一步论证了政治挂帅，解放思想，坚决贯彻党的总路线，是农业大丰收的根本保证。海澄县红旗人民公社新厝大队去年晚稻插秧时曾经有人强调土质和水利等条件都不好，无法跃进，说什么“阉鸡不能跟凤飞”。但是这个生产大队在党的领导下，坚决发动群众，依靠群众修建两座水库和挖了许多平塘。他们又挑沙积肥改良了土壤，并进行合理密植，结果晚稻亩产一千八百三十斤，比1957年增产六倍多。这次农民总结时说：“有了党的领导，有了群众力量，就能和凤一样地飞了。”农民蓝青山运用辩证法分析去年跃进的经验说：不敢跃进的人是以旧眼光看新事物，只看到死的田，而没有看到活的人，有了党的领导和群众力量，再加上实干、苦干、巧干，低产可以变高产。
    干部遇事和群众商量，通力合作，万众一心，加上必要的措施和技术，定能样样争取丰收。这是全区各地体会最深刻的一条经验。云霄县佳洲大队成为全县丰产红旗就是因为坚决相信党的话，坚决走群众路线。每推行一个新措施，干部都事先和老农商量，让群众讨论，大家同意了，就干得既快且好。
    在增产措施方面，群众以自己的亲身体会从各方面说明，根据“八字宪法”去作，定能年年增产。他们认为“八字宪法”是互相联系互相促进的整体，在执行“八字宪法”时要因地制宜，要从具体出发。
    通过总结，全专区的干部和群众对争取今年更大跃进的信心更加高涨。目前，专区各人民公社正在总结经验的基础上，开展整顿人民公社运动和冬季生产运动。
