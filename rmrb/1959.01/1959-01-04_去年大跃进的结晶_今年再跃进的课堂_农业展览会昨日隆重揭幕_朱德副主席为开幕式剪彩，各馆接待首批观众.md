Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - The National Agricultural Exhibition showcasing the great achievements of agricultural socialist construction in 1958 opened grandly yesterday morning in Sanlitun, eastern suburb of the capital.

The newly built, solemn and spacious exhibition hall was festively decorated today to receive the first group of visitors. National flags fluttered atop the hall in the main exhibition hall, and countless red flags and colorful flags fluttered in the wind in front of the hall, appearing particularly bright and beautiful in the bright sunshine after the snow. The magnificent gilded statues of male and female farmers standing in the center of the square, holding ears of wheat high and holding steelmaking tools, illustrate that in 1958, Chinese farmers, with soaring enthusiasm, not only produced an unprecedented amount of agricultural products for the motherland, but also produced steel.

Enthusiastic crowds, braving the biting north wind, poured in continuously to participate in today's opening ceremony. Those who attended the opening ceremony included Vice Chairman Zhu De, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Tan Zhenlin, Deputy Director of the Seventh Office of the State Council Chen Zhengren, and responsible comrades from various ministries such as agriculture, state farms, health, and aquatic products, as well as 6,000 representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction.

At 10:00 a.m., the opening ceremony was held in the central hall, presided over by Chen Zhengren, Deputy Director of the Seventh Office of the State Council. When Chen Zhengren announced the official opening of the 1958 National Agricultural Exhibition, the enthusiastic crowd surged to the entrance of the comprehensive hall on the right side of the hall.

Vice Chairman Zhu De cut the ribbon in front of the comprehensive hall.

After the ribbon-cutting, under the guidance of Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Ruilong and others, central responsible comrades and representatives from various regions entered the hall for a visit.

The exhibition's eleven halls – the comprehensive hall, the crop hall, the rural industry hall, the increased production measures hall, the tool hall, the forestry hall, the aquatic products hall, the animal husbandry hall, the meteorology hall, the cultural and health hall, and the women's hall – were simultaneously crowded with visitors. The great harvest of various crops such as grain and cotton in China in 1958, the great leap forward in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and meteorological work, the preliminary development of rural industry, the achievements of rural cultural and health undertakings, the contributions of rural women on the socialist construction front, and the infinitely rich experience in increasing production, etc., were all presented to the audience. Liu Ruilong frequently introduced the content and important exhibits to the central responsible comrades and representatives from various regions during the tour.

Today, the first group of visitors were mainly representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction. Visiting the exhibition, learning, and exchanging experiences is one of the main contents of their trip to Beijing for the meeting. Therefore, many representatives were very careful during their first visit, searching for the goals they wanted to see and copying the exhibition materials into their notebooks. In the next few days, they will continue to conduct organized visits and learning.

Before the opening of the exhibition, people from various places in Northeast China had already sent people to visit. In the future, all parts of the country will send people to visit in an organized manner in order to absorb experience and strive for a greater leap forward this year.

The exhibition is expected to run until the end of May this year. (Attached pictures)

    去年大跃进的结晶　今年再跃进的课堂
    农业展览会昨日隆重揭幕
    朱德副主席为开幕式剪彩，各馆接待首批观众
    新华社3日讯　展出1958年农业社会主义建设伟大成就的全国农业展览会，3日上午在首都东郊三里屯开幕。
    新建的庄严宏敞的展览馆今天盛装着接待了第一批观众。展览馆大厅顶上国旗飘扬，馆前无数面红旗和彩旗随风招展，在雪后的明媚的阳光里显得分外鲜妍。矗立在广场中央的一簇男女农民的雄伟的泥金塑像，高举着麦穗和拿着炼钢工具，说明1958年我国农民以冲天的干劲，不仅给祖国生产了空前多的农产品，而且还生产了钢铁。
    热情澎湃的人流，冒着刺骨的朔风不断涌来，参加了今天的开幕式。参加开幕式的有朱德副主席、中共中央书记处书记谭震林、国务院七办副主任陈正人和农业、农垦、卫生、水产等各部的负责同志，以及出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的六千名代表。
    上午十时，开幕式在中央大厅举行，由国务院第七办公室副主任陈正人主持。当陈正人宣布1958年全国农业展览会正式开幕时，热情的人群就拥到了大厅右侧的综合馆的入口处。
    朱德副主席在综合馆前剪了彩。
    剪彩后，在农业部副部长刘瑞龙等引导下，中央负责同志和各地的代表们就入馆参观。
    展览会的十一个馆：综合馆、农作物馆、农村工业馆、增产措施馆、工具馆、林业馆、水产馆、畜牧馆、气象馆、文教卫生馆和妇女馆同时挤满了观众。1958年我国粮棉等各种农作物的大丰收，林、牧、副、渔各业和气象工作的大跃进，农村工业的初步发展，农村文教卫生事业的成就，农村妇女在社会主义建设战线上的贡献，以及无限丰富的增产经验等等，都一齐呈现在观众的面前了。刘瑞龙在引导参观时，频频向中央负责同志和各地代表介绍展览的内容和重要的展品。
    今天第一批观众主要是出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的代表们。参观展览会，学习和交流经验是他们这次上北京开会的主要内容之一。因此，许多代表第一次参观就很仔细，寻找着他们要看的目标，用笔记本抄录着展览的材料。在最近几天内，他们还将继续进行有组织的参观和学习。
    展览会开幕以前，东北各地就已经派人前来参观。今后，全国各地都将有组织地派人来参观，以便吸取经验，争取今年更大的跃进。
    展览会预计将一直展览到今年5月底。（附图片）
