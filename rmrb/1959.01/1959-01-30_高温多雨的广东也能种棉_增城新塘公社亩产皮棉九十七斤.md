According to a report from the Southern Daily News: The successful cotton planting experience of Xintang Commune in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, has paved the way for large-scale cotton planting in Guangdong this year. Xintang Commune had a bumper cotton harvest in 1958. After measurement and verification, the harvested area was 31.9 mu, with an average yield of 97.3 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The yield of a high-yield plot of 0.825 mu was equivalent to 416 jin per mu, setting the highest record for cotton yield per mu in the province.

This commune is located in the central part of Guangdong Province, in a hilly area. Starting in 1955, Luo Shanqing, a young man from the original Yongfeng Cooperative, boldly broke the "authoritative conclusion" that "Guangdong is hot and rainy and not suitable for growing cotton" and experimented with cotton planting, achieving high yields for several years. Last year, the commune implemented a system where the Party committee took the lead and organized an 8-person cotton planting team to be specifically responsible for the management of cotton fields. They conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" and took measures to further solve the problems of excessive rain and pests. The cotton planted from March to August last year all achieved bumper harvests. At the same time, cotton planted on barren land and slopes had the same high yields as cotton planted in the fields.

Since last year, Party committees at all levels have given the commune their kind attention and support. Comrade Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a special trip to the commune to visit and encouraged them to continue their efforts and strive for an even greater cotton harvest this year. Hundreds of people from all over the province have visited the commune. The Provincial Economic Crop Representative Conference also held an on-site meeting in the commune. People who came to visit were very interested in the commune's high-yield cotton and praised it greatly. (Attached picture)

    高温多雨的广东也能种棉
    增城新塘公社亩产皮棉九十七斤
    据南方日报消息　广东增城县新塘公社历年种植棉花成功的事实，为广东省今年大量种植棉花开辟了道路。新塘公社1958年棉花丰收。经过丈量核实，收获面积为三十一点九亩，平均亩产皮棉九十七点三斤。其中一块零点八二五亩高产田的产量，折算亩产达四百一十六斤，创全省棉花亩产的最高纪录。
    这个公社位于广东省的中部，是丘陵地带。从1955年开始，原永丰小社青年罗善清就大胆打破“广东高温、雨多，不适宜种棉花”的“权威论断”，试种棉花，几年来都获得高产。去年，社里实行党委挂帅，组织了八个人的植棉小组，专门负责管理棉田。他们认真地执行了“八字宪法”，采取措施进一步解决雨多、虫害的问题。去年从3月至8月种植的棉花都获得了丰收。同时，在烂屋地、坡地上种植的棉花，也和在田里种植的一样高产。
    去年以来，各级党委对这个社给予亲切的关怀和支持。省委书记赵紫阳同志特地到这个社参观，勉励他们要继续努力，争取今年棉花更大丰收。全省各地有数百人到这个社参观过。全省经济作物代表会议也曾到这个社举行现场会议。前来参观的人，对这个社的高产棉花感到很大的兴趣，并大加赞赏。（附图片）
