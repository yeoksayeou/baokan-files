Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 15th. According to the "Soviet Russia Newspaper," Soviet scientific researchers recently conducted their first diving operation in the central Arctic region at the Soviet "North Pole Six" ice floe station. This type of work had never been carried out in the central Arctic before. The staff at the ice floe station regarded this diving operation as a gift to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　The purpose of this diving operation was to conduct underwater photography to study the underwater shape of the ice layer and to install new machines for studying the floating conditions of the ice layer.

　　The diving operation was very successful. The divers, wearing Soviet-made diving suits, descended into the water from an ice hole made by hydrologists from the ice floe station. The temperature at the station was minus 40 degrees Celsius, but the temperature under the ice was only minus 1.8 degrees Celsius.

　　This diving operation proved that Soviet diving equipment and new automatic machines for studying the ice layer are very suitable for the conditions in the central Arctic.

    北极中心地带的创举
    苏联潜水员深入冰下考察
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据“苏维埃俄罗斯报”报道，苏联科学考察人员最近在天寒地冻的北极中心地带的苏联“北极六号”浮冰站地方，进行了第一次潜水工作。这种工作过去从来没有在北极中心地带进行过，浮冰站上的工作人员把这次潜水工作作为向苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的献礼。
    这次潜水工作的目的是，进行水下摄影，以研究冰层在水下一面的形状和装置研究冰层漂浮情况的新机器。
    这次的潜水工作进行得很成功。潜水员穿着苏联制造的潜水衣，由浮冰站上水文工作者的冰窟窿中沉下水去，这时站上的温度是零下四十度，但冰下却只有零下一点八度。
    这次潜水工作证明，苏联的潜水装备和新的研究冰层的自动机器都非常适合北极中心地带的条件。
