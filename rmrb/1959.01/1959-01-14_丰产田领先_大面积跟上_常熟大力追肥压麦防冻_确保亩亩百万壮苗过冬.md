Leading in High-Yield Fields, Following Up on Large Areas
Changshu Vigorously Top-Dresses Wheat and Prevents Freezing to Ensure One Million Strong Seedlings Per Mu Overwinter

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 13th dispatch) Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is adopting the method of "leading in high-yield fields and following up on large areas," using basic farmland to drive the great leap forward in general large fields. It is vigorously carrying out winter top-dressing, wheat pressing, and frost prevention to ensure that each mu of wheat field has one million strong seedlings to safely overwinter, determined to achieve the goal of "three wheats catching up with rice again."

In the great winter wheat field management campaign in Changshu County, all people's communes used high-yield plots, high-yield embankments, and high-yield fields to drive the great leap forward in general large fields. The county has 330,831 mu of large-area, high-yield fields, accounting for 20.5% of the total summer-ripening area, achieving high-yield plots in counties and communes, high-yield embankments in large and small teams, and high-yield fields for the masses. The county and commune established large-area, high-yield field campaign committees, headed by the first secretary, with each high-yield plot equipped with two cadres and technicians for full-time management; each large team has a party branch secretary or team leader serving as the embankment chief, stationed in the embankment to command. The high-yield plots and embankments are also divided into mounds according to fields and natural terrain, each mound equipped with a backbone, specifically responsible; each plot is marked with a sign, ensuring indicators and measures are in place for the field, and management responsibilities are assigned to individuals.

Through vigorous development of high-yield fields, adopting the method of "cadres taking the lead, high-yield fields leading, and large areas following up," setting examples, and organizing on-site visits, comprehensive promotion was rapidly carried out. After the Zhizhi Commune made a model of wheat pressing and frost prevention, it mobilized all commune management team leaders and above to visit. After the meeting, the entire commune mobilized more than 4,000 people every day to top-dress, press wheat, and prevent frost. When the Mei Li Commune Party Committee implemented frost prevention measures, it first built a "windbreak wall" in its own high-yield plot, and then mobilized the production teams to visit; now, most of the more than 3,000 mu of high-yield fields in the entire commune have built windbreak walls.

In the winter management of three wheats, various people's communes also organized field inspections, inserting flags according to seedling vigor, mound by mound, and launching a campaign to eliminate Class III fields and Class III seedlings. The Zhaoshi Commune put forward the fighting slogan "Declare war on yellow seedlings, advance on Class III fields," and organized a combat team of more than 500 people to eliminate Class III fields and Class III seedlings, focusing on top-dressing, wheat pressing, and frost prevention. After four days of intensive efforts, 1,825 mu of yellow seedlings have turned green. The Huangxin Commune contracted 2,112 mu of Class III fields to 118 commune and team cadres, implementing contracted fertilization and contracted transformation, applying mud fertilizer and refined fertilizer once each in two days. Under the encouragement of the battle cry "Eliminate Class III to catch up with Class I, improve Class II to surpass Class I, and ensure one million strong seedlings per mu overwinter," the members of Zhangqiao Commune launched a campaign of "everyone contracted to eliminate Class III fields," and 1,350 mu of Class III fields were all given an additional 30 dan of man-made manure and 10 jin of chemical fertilizer.

As of January 10th, after more than 20 days of intensive efforts, 770,000 mu of three wheat fields in Changshu County have generally been top-dressed twice, of which 270,000 mu have been top-dressed three times, and 95,000 mu have been top-dressed four times. 700,000 mu of wheat have been pressed. During this snowfall, many people's communes combined soil fumigation with field smoking and covered wheat fields with rice straw. After efforts in processing and management, the county's wheat seedlings have more than one million seedlings in Class I fields, seven to eight hundred thousand seedlings in Class II fields, and even the poor ones have four to five hundred thousand seedlings.

In the Great Leap Forward last year, Changshu County first proposed the initiative of "three wheats catching up with rice and doubling rice yield" to the entire province of Jiangsu. As a result, the single-yield of some three wheats caught up with rice, and the single-yield of rice increased by 148% compared to 1957. Now, the people of Changshu have put forward the goal of "three wheats catching up with rice again and rice yield doubling again," and are making every effort to strive for a bumper harvest of three wheats.

    丰产田领先  大面积跟上
    常熟大力追肥压麦防冻  确保亩亩百万壮苗过冬
    本报南京13日电　江苏省常熟县采取“丰产田领先，大面积跟上”的方法，以基本田带动一般大田一起跃进，大搞冬季追肥、压麦、防冻，确保亩亩麦田有百万壮苗安全过冬，决心实现“三麦再赶水稻”的指标。
    常熟县在大搞冬季麦田管理运动中，各人民公社都以丰产片、丰产圩和丰产田来带动一般大田一起跃进。全县大面积高额丰产田有三十三万零八百三十一亩，占夏熟总面积的20.5％，做到了县、社有丰产片、大、小队有丰产圩，群众有丰产田。县、社成立了大面积高额丰产田运动委员会，由第一书记挂帅，每个丰产片配备两个干部和技术员专职管理；各大队有一个支书或队长担任丰产圩圩长，驻圩指挥。丰产片、圩内还按田亩和自然地形划分为丘，每丘配有骨干，具体负责；块块插牌，做到指标、措施到田，管理责任到人。
    通过大搞丰产田，采取“干部带头，丰产田领先，大面积跟上”的方法，做出样子，组织现场参观，迅速全面推广。支塘公社做出了压麦、防冻样子后，就发动全社管理组长以上干部参观。会后，全公社每天出动四千多人追肥、压麦、防冻。梅李公社党委在贯彻防冻措施时，先在自己丰产片里筑起“防风墙”，然后发动各生产队参观；现在，全社三千多亩丰产田多数都搭了防风墙。
    在三麦越冬管理中，各个人民公社还组织田头大检查，根据苗势，逐丘插旗，开展消灭三类田、三类苗运动。赵市公社提出“向黄苗宣战、向三类田进军”的战斗口号，组织一支五百多人的消灭三类田、三类苗战斗队，重点追肥和压麦、防冻。经过四天突击，一千八百二十五亩黄苗已经转青。黄信公社将二千一百一十二亩三类田包给一百一十八个社、队干部负责，实行包施肥、包转变，二天内普施了一次泥肥和一次精肥。张桥公社社员在“消灭三类赶一类，提高二类超一类，保证亩亩百万壮苗过冬”的战斗口号鼓舞下，掀起了“人人包干消灭三类田”的运动，一千三百五十亩三类田都增施三十担人造粪和十斤化肥。
    到1月10日止，经过二十多天的突击，常熟县七十七万亩三麦田普遍追了二次肥，其中有二十七万亩追过三次肥，九万五千亩追了四次肥。压麦七十万亩。在这次降雪期间，许多人民公社结合熏土进行田间熏烟，并在麦田里盖稻草。经过努力加工管理以后，全县麦苗一类田有一百万苗以上，二类田有七、八十万苗，差的也有四、五十万苗。
    常熟县在去年大跃进中首先向江苏全省提出“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的倡议，结果部分三麦单产赶上了水稻，水稻单产比1957年增长148％。现在常熟人民又提出了“三麦再赶水稻，水稻再翻一番”的指标，全力争取三麦丰收。
