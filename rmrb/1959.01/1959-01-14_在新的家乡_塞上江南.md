In the New Hometown – “Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall”

	The New Masters of the New Land

	Yueyahu (Crescent Lake), Taole County, Ningxia, was a desolate landscape of sand dunes just two years ago. After the immigrants from the Sanmenxia Reservoir area arrived here in June last year, this silent grassland began to seethe with activity, and the desolate Yueyahu transformed into a lovely new village.

	Now, three new villages have been established in Yueyahu. In rows of neat houses live more than a thousand Shaanxi people who are determined to settle down in Ningxia. Among them, the old man Sun Changsheng, who lives in Haojiadian, is highly respected.

	Old man Sun Changsheng is sixty-eight years old this year, his hair and beard are all white, but he is still very energetic. The day after he arrived in Yueyahu, it was raining heavily. The desire to build a new hometown made him forget the fatigue of the journey, and he carried a shovel to inspect the soil quality of the wasteland in the rain. When he turned over the topsoil with a shovel and found that the sand was only four or five inches deep, and underneath was all black and oily clay, he couldn't help but say repeatedly: "Good land, good land! With this kind of land, what is there to worry about!" The old man was determined to change the face of Yueyahu with the young people. In the early winter of last year, when the ground was already frozen, he still harnessed livestock to open up the wasteland. When someone advised him to rest, he always replied: "Not tired, the more I open this kind of land, the more energetic I become." In November, when the ground froze and the weather was cold, the commune mobilized members to complete the winter irrigation task of the new wasteland, but at that time the water level in the river dropped, and the canal could not get water, so they had to go into the water to repair the canal entrance. On the day of repairing the canal entrance, the weather was very cold, and several young people were a little hesitant to go into the water, but old man Sun Changsheng took off his pants and jumped into the ice-cold water first. At this time, the young people followed suit one by one. Everyone fought hard in the cold, bone-chilling water for three hours, and finally let the river water flow into the canal, ensuring the winter irrigation of hundreds of acres of land.

	Old man Sun Changsheng has deeply fallen in love with Yueyahu in Taole. He often says that everything is good about this place except that it lacks trees. Now the old man is working with the members to cultivate a large number of seedlings, preparing to green the wasteland, determined to conquer the wind and sand, and leave the oasis to future generations. (Li Sanshun)

	"Our Good Teacher"

	On the streets of Yongning County, you can often see a young teacher sending students home one by one. He is Zhang Bin, the head teacher of the first grade of Yanghe Primary School in Yongning County, who came here from Beijing last spring to be a teacher.

	Yanghe Primary School is located in the southwest corner of the county town, about a mile away from the main street. A highway runs across in front of their school. Cars and horse-drawn carriages come and go in an endless stream. The young Zhang Bin likes his students very much, because most of the first-grade students live on the street. When school is over, he is afraid that the students will be hit by cars, so he decided to send the students home. Every time the sun sets in the west, he lines up the primary school students, leads them, sings songs, and returns them to their homes. This is no exception in the cold winter and windy days. This incident deeply moved the local people.

	Because of his serious teaching, caring for children, and dedication to his work, he was rated as a model teacher in the school. (Xie Shiyan)

	Let the Blowers Leave the Factory on Time

	Feng Xiuying moved to Yinchuan from Shanghai last September. Soon after arriving here, she was assigned to the Yinchuan Agricultural Tool Machinery Factory to learn to be a fitter. At that time, Yinchuan City was carrying out a mass steelmaking campaign, and all government agencies, schools, industrial and commercial circles, and street residents in the city wanted blowers from the Agricultural Tool Machinery Factory. The task of manufacturing blowers at the Agricultural Tool Machinery Factory increased several times compared to the past. Therefore, the fitter workshop was particularly busy, working overtime day and night to rush the assembly.

	After Feng Xiuying went to work, because the task was urgent, the master only taught her some basic operating procedures, and then let her work independently and assemble the blowers herself. At that time, Feng Xiuying was both happy and scared. On the first day of assembling the blower, she encountered difficulties: the tile rack on the blower was uneven, either this side was high or that side was low. She disassembled and assembled it again and again, but it was always not installed properly. She was so anxious that she was covered in sweat, and she thought in her heart: "Forget it, I've only been an apprentice for a dozen days, how can I do assembly work like a master?" But then she thought again: "Tens of thousands of people are making steel, how can a few masters supply enough blowers?" So she carefully studied it, thought of a way, and padded two pieces of iron sheet on the low side of the tile rack, which ensured the quality of the blower. When putting the shaft on the blower, because the diameter of the shaft cast by the sand casting workshop did not meet the specifications, some were thick and some were thin, and they could not be tightened when installed on the blower. According to the operating procedures she had learned, such products should be "scrapped." At that time, Feng Xiuying thought: the steelmaking task is very tight now, and blowers are urgently needed. If this batch of shafts is scrapped, it will prolong the time for the blowers to leave the factory and affect steelmaking. So she took the shaft and asked the master for advice. Under the guidance of the master, she made many small holes in the fur of the shaft, which thickened the diameter of the shaft and ensured that the blower left the factory on time.

	Feng Xiuying not only works very seriously, but also uses her spare time to organize self-study groups, saves pocket money to buy many professional books for self-study, and actively seeks help from masters. Therefore, she has made rapid progress in her work. She was able to independently install blowers one month after entering the factory. Now, she can install two to three blowers a day by herself. She is one of the apprentices in the fitter workshop who has made the fastest progress. (Xiao Shuying)

	Salesperson "No. 042"

	In the service attitude competition column of the No. 1 store of the Yinchuan Industrial Products Store, several red flags are inserted under the name of "No. 042." "No. 042" is Wu Juying. Customers call her "a Shanghai girl with a kind attitude, who never gets tired of answering questions, and never gets tired of showing merchandise."

	In mid-September, Wu Juying came to Yinchuan from Shanghai and became a salesperson. The difficulty she encountered was that she could not speak the language. She thought: "If I can't speak the language, how can I serve the people of the Northwest?" From then on, she used every opportunity to ask others for advice, recite the names and prices of various commodities, and even learned Mandarin in her dreams. She is also very enthusiastic to customers, calling the elderly "Grandpa" and the young people "Comrade," and trying her best to meet the needs of customers. Once, an old man nearly seventy years old wanted to buy a thermos bottle, but he hesitated there, wanting to pay and wanting to return the thermos bottle. When she saw it, she cordially greeted him: "Grandpa, is there something wrong with the thermos bottle? I'll get you another one!" The old man listened to it by his ear and happily gave a thumbs up and said: "Very good, this child is good!" Another time, a customer wanted to buy leather shoes, but he didn't want to buy them because he saw that the leather shoes were not shiny. Wu Juying took out her handkerchief without hesitation and wiped the leather shoes. The customer hurriedly stopped her, but she said: "It's okay, it can be washed!" There are many things like this. Because of her good service attitude, she is often praised by customers.

	When she left Shanghai, she still had some incorrect views on Ningxia, but in just a few months, she personally saw the enthusiastic people here and the rapid development of Ningxia's construction. She was extremely excited. In a letter to her father, she wrote: "Don't worry, it's too good here. I love Yinchuan and I am willing to become a Yinchuan person!" (With illustration)

    在新的家乡——“塞上江南”
    新土地上的新主人
      宁夏陶乐县月牙湖，两年前还
  是一片荒凉的沙丘。去年6月当三门峡水库区的移民来到这里之后，这片沉寂的草原沸腾起来，荒凉的
  月牙湖变成了可爱的新农村。
    现在，月牙湖已经建立起三个新村。在一排排整齐的房屋里，住着一千多个决心在宁夏安家落户的陕西人。其中住在郝家点的孙常胜老汉是很受人们尊敬的一个。
    孙常胜老汉今年六十八岁，头发、胡子全白了，但精力还十分健旺。他来到月牙湖的第二天，天正下着大雨。建设新家乡的愿望使他忘记了旅途的劳累，扛起铁锹冒雨去察看荒地的土质。当他一锹翻开土皮，发现在四五寸深的沙土下面全是黑油油的粘土时，不禁连声地说：“好地，好地！有这号地还愁什么！”老汉决心要和青年人一起改变月牙湖的面貌。去年初冬，地已经上了冻，他还套着牲口在荒滩上开地。有人劝他休息，他总是这样回答：“不累，这样的地越开越有劲。”11月地冻天寒了，公社发动社员完成新荒地的冬灌任务，但当时河里水位下降，渠道不能上水，只有下水整修渠口。整修渠口的那天，气候很冷，几个年青人对下水还有点犹豫，孙常胜老汉却脱了裤子第一个奋身跳到冰凌漂流的水里。这时，青年人才一个个跟着跳下去。大家在寒冷刺骨的水里苦战了三个钟头，终于让河水流进了渠道，保证了几百亩土地的冬灌。
    孙常胜老汉已经深深地爱上了陶乐月牙湖这个地方。他常说这个地方什么都好就是缺树，现在老汉正在和社员一起培植大批树苗，准备绿化荒原，决心征服风沙，将绿洲留给子孙。　（李三顺）
  “我们的好老师”
    在永宁县城大街上，常常可以看到一个年轻的老师挨家挨户地把学生送回家。他就是永宁县养和完小一年级班主任张斌，去年春天从北京来到这里当教师。
    养和完小设在县城西南角，离大街约一里多地。一条公路横亘在他们学校前面。汽车、马车来来往往，络绎不绝。年青的张斌十分喜欢自己的学生，因为一年级学生大部分住在街上，放学回家时，他恐怕学生被车撞了，决定送学生回家。每当太阳西斜的时刻，他让小学生们排好队，领着他们，唱着歌，回到家里。在严寒的冬天，在刮风的日子，也不例外。这件事深深感动了当地的群众。
    由于他认真教学，关心孩子，安心工作，被评为学校的模范教师。

   让鼓风机按时出厂
    冯秀英是去年9月从上海迁来银川的。到这里不久，就被分配到银川农具机械厂学钳工。当时银川市正开展了全民炼钢运动，全市各机关、学校、工商界、街道居民都
  向农具机械厂要鼓风机，农具机械厂制造鼓风机的任务比过去增加了好几倍。因而钳工车间特别忙碌，
  日夜加班赶着装配。
    冯秀英上班后，因为任务紧急，老师傅只带她学了些基本操作规程后，就让她独立工作，自己装配鼓风机。当时冯秀英又高兴、又害怕。在装配鼓风机的头一天，就遇到了困难：鼓风机上的瓦架子上不平，不是这面高，就是那面低。她拆了又装，装了又拆，反复多次，总是安装不好。急得她满头是汗，心里想：“算了吧，才当了十几天的学徒，哪能像老师傅一样的做装配工作？”但又转念一想：“几万人在炼钢，老靠几个老师傅哪能供得上鼓风机？”于是又仔细研究，想了办法，在低的一面瓦架子上垫了两块铁皮，这样就保证了鼓风机的质量。给鼓风机上轴时，因翻砂车间铸的轴直径不合规格，有的粗，有的细，安到鼓风机上拧不紧。按学过的操作规程要求，这样的产品要
  “报废”的。当时冯秀英想：现在炼钢任务很紧，急需鼓风机，如果这批轴子报废了，就要延长鼓风机出厂的时间，影响炼钢。于是她拿了轴子请教老师傅，在老师傅的指导下，她在轴子的毛皮上打了许多小眼，使轴子直径加粗，保证了鼓风机按时出厂。
    冯秀英不仅工作很认真，还利用业余时间组织自学小组，节省了零用钱买了许多业务书籍自学，并主动争取老师傅帮助，因此，她业务上进步很快，到厂一个月便能独立安装鼓风机，现在，她一人一天能装二至三部鼓风机。是钳工车间学徒进步最快的一个。

   “042号”营业员
    银川市工业品商店第一门市部的服务态度竞赛栏里，“042号”名下插着好几面红旗。“042号”就是吴菊英。顾客们称她为“态度和蔼、百问不烦、百拿不厌的上海姑娘。”
      9月中旬，吴菊英从上海来到银川，当上了营业员，碰到的困难是，语言不通。她想：“话不通，怎么能为西北人民服务呢？”从此，她就利用一切机会请教别人，背诵各种商品的名称和价格，甚至做梦时也在学普通话。对待顾客也是非常热情，见老人称“大爷”，见年轻的称“同志”，尽量满足顾客的需要。有一次，有个近七十岁的老汉买热水瓶，在那儿犹豫，又想交钱，又想还热水瓶，她看见了，就亲热地招呼：“老大爷，是不是热水瓶不大好，我给您换一个！”老汉放在耳边听了听，高兴地伸出大拇指说：“挺好，这个娃娃好！”又有一次，有个顾客要买皮鞋，可是看见皮鞋不光亮，就不想买，吴菊英毫不迟疑地掏出手帕擦皮鞋，顾客急忙去制止，她却说：“没关系，可以洗！”像这样的事情是很多的。由于她服务态度好，常常受到顾客的表扬。
    离开上海时，对宁夏还有些不正确的看法，可是在短短几个月中，她亲眼看到了这里热情的人民，看到了宁夏建设事业的飞跃发展，她兴奋极了，在给父亲的信中，她写道：“您不要担心，这里太好了。我爱银川，愿意成为银川人！”（附图片）
