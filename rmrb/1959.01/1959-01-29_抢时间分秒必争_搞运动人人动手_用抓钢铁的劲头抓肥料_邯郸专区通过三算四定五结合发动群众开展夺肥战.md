Seize Every Second, Launch a Mass Movement, Apply the Energy of Steel Production to Fertilizer Production
Handan Special District Mobilizes the Masses to Launch a Fertilizer Grab Campaign Through Three Calculations, Four Determinations, and Five Combinations

    (Reported by our newspaper) A massive and grand fertilizer accumulation and production movement has been widely and deeply launched in the vast rural areas and cities of Handan Special District, Hebei Province. Since the beginning of winter, this special district has closely integrated with wheat field management and launched a mass fertilizer accumulation and production movement. As of January 20th, the district had accumulated 153.7 billion catties of natural fertilizer and produced more than 5 billion catties of bacterial fertilizer and soil-based fertilizer. Recently, the Handan District Party Committee further analyzed the current situation of the fertilizer accumulation movement and decided to make persistent efforts, with the determination and perseverance of large-scale steel production, for the whole party and the whole people to fight for fertilizer. Before the end of February, two campaigns will be launched to obtain 400 billion catties of natural fertilizer and 18 billion catties of soil-based fertilizer, accumulating and producing 10,000 to 20,000 catties of natural fertilizer and about 1,500 catties of soil-based fertilizer per mu for wheat returning to green and jointing stages, and applying 10,000 to 30,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu for spring-sown crops. The first campaign has been fully launched since the 21st of this month, and a professional army of 1.3 million people and workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers have all been投入 into this movement. Handan City accumulated 2.6 billion catties of fertilizer this week, accounting for 53% of the total amount of fertilizer accumulated throughout the winter.
    Several months ago, in order to promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959, the Handan District Party Committee analyzed the fertilizer demand situation in the district for the spring season. The district has a total of 9.5 million mu of wheat, an increase of 25.3% compared with 1958. Deep plowing was universally carried out before sowing, and the amount of seeds sown was greatly increased. The 4.3 million mu of high-yield fields were densely planted using methods such as "narrow row dense planting," "wide amplitude," and "intercropping." They have now generally tillered one to three times, and 5.9 million mu have reached more than 600,000 plants per mu, more than doubling the number of plants compared with the previous year. With the increased density of plants, the amount of fertilizer must be correspondingly increased. In order to prevent lodging and difficulty in applying coarse fertilizer after the wheat jointing stage, all coarse fertilizer and more than 50% of the fine fertilizer must be applied before the Qingming Festival. In addition, spring-sown crops such as grains, cotton, oilseeds, and vegetables also need to be fully prepared with fertilizer before the Awakening of Insects, especially the more than 300,000 mu of large-area, high-yield fields, which must have sufficient fertilizer as a guarantee. Since the beginning of winter, the Handan District Party Committee has paid great attention to this characteristic and promptly mobilized the masses to seize the time, fight for every second, and vigorously promote the fertilizer accumulation movement.
    In mid-November 1958, the secretaries of the district, county, and commune Party committees calculated the amount of fertilizer needed for wheat seedlings in the Qingchun Commune of Ci County. The 10,000 mu of 10,000-jin high-yield fields here had many yellow seedlings due to insufficient fertilizer. This aroused the high attention of Party committees at all levels to fertilizer accumulation. In early December, the district party committee organized district, county, and commune level secretaries to conduct a major inspection of fertilizer accumulation and topdressing in twenty-one typical people's communes and thirty wheat high-yield fields throughout the district. The inspection revealed that some commune members believed that the wheat seedlings were well-sown and growing strong, and their understanding of the significance of fertilizer accumulation was insufficient, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated was not large. In order to carry out the fertilizer accumulation and production movement, various places universally launched "three calculations": first, calculate the experience of increased production through topdressing in 1958; second, calculate the fertilizer needs and deficiencies of high-yield fields; and third, calculate the sources of fertilizer. Through the "three calculations," cadres at all levels and the broad masses have learned scientific calculation and analysis, and have boosted greater enthusiasm. After carrying out the "three calculations," Julu County found that only 10,000 catties of fertilizer per mu for ordinary wheat fields and 30,000 catties for high-yield wheat fields would require 58.5 billion catties of fertilizer, while only 18.4 billion catties of fertilizer had been accumulated. The broad masses of cadres and commune members overcame complacency and launched a mass movement to find fertilizer sources, with everyone offering suggestions and every household making plans, finding thirty-two kinds of fertilizer sources in two days. The number of people accumulating fertilizer also increased from more than 30,000 to more than 75,000, accumulating 18.3 billion catties of fertilizer and producing 40.59 million catties of soil-based fertilizer. The Peipozhuang Production Brigade of the Linmingguan People's Commune in Yongnian County mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of increasing fertilizer and increasing production in 1958 and formulated a fertilizer accumulation plan for 1959. The brigade's 3,003 mu of wheat fields planned to produce 800 catties per mu. In addition to applying base fertilizer, another 30,000 catties of fertilizer per mu need to be applied before and after the Spring Festival, requiring a total of 90.09 million catties of fertilizer, and 1.98 million catties must be accumulated every day before the Spring Festival to complete the task. Lian Songshou, the brigade leader, realized the importance of the problem and the urgency of the time, and immediately mobilized the masses to find 167 kinds of fertilizer sources such as pig, sheep, and livestock pens, and old toilet bottoms, accumulating 27 million catties of fertilizer in seven days.
    While universally carrying out "three calculations" to improve the enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer, in order to strengthen the responsibility system, various places also universally promoted "four determinations" (assigning fertilizer accumulation tasks at all levels, determining quantity, determining quality, determining time, and determining rewards) and "five combinations" (combining coarse fertilizer and soil-based fertilizer, combining collective fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation, combining shock fertilizer accumulation and regular fertilizer accumulation, combining ideological education and appropriate rewards, and emphasizing both quantity and quality), linking the requirements of fertilizer accumulation and increased production with the vital interests of the broad masses, giving full play to the collective power of the people's communes, and also fully utilizing the enthusiasm of individual commune members to accumulate fertilizer, utilizing both large and scattered sources of fertilizer. The district's people's communes fixed 20,444 professional teams with more than 520,000 people, responsible for accumulating fertilizer from livestock sheds, pig farms, pig pens, sheep pens, and urine collection year-round. Bianzhuang Brigade of Xingjiawan Commune in Julu County stipulated that each livestock shed should be cleaned and padded twice a day, accumulating 150 catties of fertilizer per day, and each pig should accumulate ten carts of fertilizer per month, which is the responsibility of the breeders, fixing 123 people to dig silt, etc. In addition, it stipulates that each male laborer should accumulate ten carts of fertilizer per month, and material rewards will be given according to the quality for exceeding one cart. By implementing the "four determinations" method, the number of fertilizer accumulators increased from 270 to 1,850, and the daily fertilizer accumulation increased from 300,000 catties to 1.8 million catties.
    While vigorously accumulating and smoking fertilizer, various places have also been training a large number of local experts, using local materials to vigorously produce soil-based fertilizer. Li Zhihong, secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee, set up a soil-based fertilizer base in the Kongqiao Production Brigade of the Dongwang Commune, imparting technology on the spot and conducting experiments on the spot. In less than a month, he trained more than 300 local experts, with blossoms everywhere in the brigade. The county built 4,210 factories, producing 312 million catties of soil-based fertilizer. Their self-made ammonium sulfate and calcium sulfate are close to the level of foreign fertilizers. The district already has 8,479 soil-based fertilizer plants in production, and the self-produced soil-based fertilizer has exceeded more than twenty-five times the amount of foreign fertilizer supplied by the state in previous years.

    抢时间分秒必争　搞运动人人动手
    用抓钢铁的劲头抓肥料
    邯郸专区通过三算四定五结合发动群众开展夺肥战
    本报讯　一个声势浩大，规模壮阔的积肥、造肥运动，已在河北省邯郸专区的广大农村和城市普遍深入地展开。这个专区入冬以来就紧紧结合麦田管理，掀起了全民性的积肥、造肥运动。截至1月20日，全区已积肥一千五百三十七亿斤，造菌肥、土化肥五十亿多斤。最近中共邯郸地委进一步分析了当前积肥运动开展的情况，决定再接再厉，以大搞钢铁的决心和毅力，全党全民奋战抓肥料。2月底以前发动两个战役，拿到自然肥四千亿斤、土化肥一百八十亿斤，为小麦返青、拔节每亩积造自然肥一至两万斤，土化肥一千五百斤左右，春播作物每亩施底肥一至三万斤。从本月21日起，第一战役已全面展开，全区已有一百三十万人的专业大军和工农商学兵都投入这一运动。邯郸市这一周积肥二十六亿斤，相当整个冬季积肥数量的53％。
    几月以前，邯郸地委为了促进1959年农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进，即曾分析了全区春季需肥的情况。全区共有小麦九百五十万亩，比1958年增加了25.3％，播种前曾普遍进行了深耕，下种量大大增多，四百三十万亩丰产方都是用“窄行密植”、“宽幅”、“套种”等办法密植的，现已普遍分蘖一个到三个，有五百九十万亩每亩株数已达六十万株以上，较上一年株数增加一倍以上。株数密了，肥料必须相应地增多，为了防止倒伏和小麦拔节后不易追粗肥，全部粗肥和50％以上的细肥都必须在清明节前追上。加之春播粮棉油料蔬菜等作物，也需要在惊蛰前备足肥料，特别是三十多万亩大面积高额丰产田，必须有足够的肥料作保证。入冬以来，邯郸地委就非常注意这一特点，并及时地动员群众抢时间，分秒必争，大搞积肥运动。
    1958年11月中旬，地、县、社三级党委书记在磁县青春社查麦苗算需肥量，这里的万亩万斤丰产田，因肥料不足，黄苗很多。引起了各级党委对积肥的高度重视。12月上旬，地委又组织地、县、社三级书记对全区二十一个典型人民公社和三十个小麦丰产方，进行积肥追肥情况的大检查。检查中发现有的社员认为麦苗种的好，长的壮，对积肥意义认识不足，积肥数量不多。为了把积肥造肥运动开展起来，各地普遍展开了“三算”：一算1958年追肥增产的经验，二算丰产田需肥和缺肥数，三算肥源。通过“三算”，使各级干部和广大群众都学会了科学的计算和分析，鼓起了更大的干劲。巨鹿县经过开展“三算”，只一般麦田每亩盖肥一万斤，丰产麦田三万斤，就需肥五百八十五亿斤，而积的肥料只有一百八十四亿斤。广大干部、社员克服了麻痹情绪，展开人人献计，户户订计划的群众性的找肥源运动，两天时间找出三十二种肥源。积肥人数也由三万多人增加到七万五千多人，积肥一百八十三亿斤，造土化肥四千零五十九万斤。永年县临洺关人民公社裴坡庄生产大队，发动群众总结1958年增肥增产的经验，制定了1959年积肥计划。该队三千零三亩麦田，计划亩产八百斤，除施底肥外，春节前后还需再追肥三万斤，共需肥九千零九万斤，春节前必须每天积一百九十八万斤才能完成。大队长连宋守认识到问题的重要和时间的紧迫，立即发动群众找出猪、羊、牲畜圈、老厕所底等一百六十七种肥源，七天积肥两千七百万斤。
    在普遍进行“三算”，提高群众积肥热情的同时，为了加强责任制，各地又普遍推行了“四定”（层层分配积肥任务，定数量、定质量、定时间、定奖励）和“五结合”（粗肥和土化肥结合，集体积肥和个人积肥结合，突击积肥与经常积肥结合，思想教育和适当奖励结合，数量与质量并重）的办法，把积肥增产的要求和广大群众的切身利益联系在一起，充分的发挥了人民公社集体的威力，又充分利用了社员个人积肥的积极性，把大宗的肥源和分散的肥源都利用起来。全区各人民公社固定了两万零四百四十四个专业队，五十二万多人，负责牲畜棚、猪场、猪圈、羊圈、担尿稀常年积肥。巨鹿县邢家湾公社边庄大队，规定每个牲畜棚每日两清两垫，日积肥一百五十斤，每头猪一个月积肥十大车，由饲养员负责，固定一百二十三个人挖污泥等。另外，规定每个男劳力每月积肥十大车，超过一车根据质量给以物质奖励。通过实行“四定”办法，积肥人数由二百七十个人增加到一千八百五十个人，日积肥由三十万斤增加到一百八十万斤。
    各地在大抓积肥熏肥的同时，大量培训土专家，就地取材，大搞土化肥生产。邢台县县委书记李志宏，在东汪公社孔桥生产大队搞了个土化肥基地，就地传授技术，就地试验生产，不到一个月的时间，就培训出三百多名土专家，队队开花，全县建厂四千二百一十个，生产土化肥三亿一千二百万斤。他们自造的硫酸铵和硫酸钙接近洋化肥水平。全区已有八千四百七十九个土化肥厂投入生产，自产土化肥已超过往年国家供应洋化肥的二十五倍多。
