Talking About Cosmic Rockets and Interstellar Flight
Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Editor's Note: On January 8th, Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave a report in Beijing on the Soviet cosmic rocket. This report provided a relatively systematic and popular explanation of the operation of the Soviet cosmic rocket, the scientific research tasks undertaken by the cosmic rocket, the general situation of the various planets in the solar system, how to use cosmic rockets to reach other planets in the solar system, and the great scientific achievements of the Soviet Union in launching cosmic rockets. In order to help readers understand these issues, the report is organized and published.

The Operation of the Soviet Cosmic Rocket

We all know that the Soviet Union has put in tremendous effort in the field of artificial satellites and interstellar travel, and their technology in this area has reached the most advanced level.

More than a year ago, on October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, weighing 83.6 kilograms; a month later, on November 3, 1957, they launched an even larger and heavier artificial satellite, weighing 508.3 kilograms; and last May, they launched a third artificial satellite, which can indeed be called a giant artificial satellite, as its weight exceeded one ton, at 1327 kilograms. This series of achievements demonstrates that the Soviet Union has already taken the first step in interstellar travel technology; that is, it has been able to use a powerful rocket engine to propel an object weighing over one ton to reach the first cosmic velocity, which is a speed of about 8 kilometers per second.

On this basis, the Soviet Union continued to work, continued to improve the power of rocket engines, and continued to refine the automatic control system of the rockets. A few months later, just over a year after the launch of the first artificial satellite, on January 2nd of this year, at about 8 pm Moscow time, when residents of Moscow had just finished dinner and it was almost midnight in Siberia, a huge rocket rose from the launch site, and the cosmic rocket began to take off!

This launch time was carefully arranged. January 2nd was the "last quarter" of the moon, just as the moon moved in front of the Earth's orbit around the sun. The launch of the cosmic rocket was chosen at this time so that it would pass through the left side of the lunar region and run in front of the Earth's orbit around the sun.

Therefore, after overcoming the gravity of the Earth and the Moon, its speed in outer space, that is, its speed relative to the sun, should be its remaining speed after overcoming the gravity of the Earth and the Moon, plus the speed of the Earth's orbit around the sun. We know that the Earth's orbital speed around the sun is almost 30 kilometers per second, so at this time, the speed of the artificial planet is more than 30 kilometers per second. And because its speed is slightly higher than the Earth's orbital speed around the sun, its orbit is also slightly larger than the Earth's orbit around the sun, and is between the Earth's orbit and the orbit of Mars around the sun.

The orbit of the artificial planet is elliptical, with a maximum diameter of 343.6 million kilometers, and its orbital period is approximately 15 months, or more specifically, 450 Earth days. The eccentricity of its elliptical orbit, that is, the degree of the ellipse, is 0.148. Since the orbit is elliptical, it has a major axis and a minor axis. The Earth's orbit is also like this, elliptical with a major axis and a minor axis. The angle between the major axis of the artificial planet's orbit and the major axis of the Earth's orbit is 15 degrees, but the two orbits are on the same plane.

The moment when the cosmic rocket – the artificial planet – completely escaped the gravity of the Earth and the Moon and entered its own orbit around the sun was approximately January 7th to 8th. It will reach the perihelion of its orbit on January 14th, and its distance from the sun is estimated to be about 146.4 million kilometers, at which time its speed will be 32 kilometers per second. In early September this year, it will reach the aphelion of its orbit, and its distance from the sun is estimated to be 197 million kilometers, at which time its speed will be 27.75 kilometers per second.

From the characteristics of this orbit, we can know that the minimum distance between the orbit of the artificial planet and the orbit of Mars is fifteen million kilometers. This distance sounds large, but it is actually only a quarter of the closest distance between Earth and Mars.

According to calculations, this artificial planet, which was once a cosmic rocket, will re-approach Earth in about five years. Don't be afraid, it won't run into the Earth's atmosphere, because even though it will be relatively close to Earth at that time, the distance will still be tens of millions of kilometers!

Scientific Research Tasks of the Soviet Cosmic Rocket

Of course, the Soviet Union launched the cosmic rocket not only to make it an artificial planet; there are also many research tasks to be carried out.

First, is to study how to specifically achieve the second cosmic velocity, that is, a series of dynamic and control problems related to the speed of 11.2 kilometers per second required to escape the Earth's gravitational field.

In addition, the cosmic rocket is also loaded with many precise scientific measuring instruments. These instruments, along with radio transmitters and power supply equipment, weigh a total of 361.3 kilograms, which can be said to be the effective payload of the cosmic rocket, the part that ultimately performs the mission.

The launch of the cosmic rocket naturally uses a multi-stage rocket. The final stage, including the loaded instruments, weighs 1472 kilograms, which is 145 kilograms more than the third artificial satellite. This is still the weight after the fuel is used up. If the original fuel carried is included, the weight would be even greater. Therefore, the tool used by the Soviet Union to launch such a cosmic rocket is a very powerful tool.

There are a total of nine types of instruments used for measurement:

One is an instrument for detecting the Moon's magnetic field. Why measure the Moon's magnetic field? Because we know very little about celestial magnetic fields. Of course, living on Earth, we know about the Earth's magnetic field, and we also know about the Sun's, but whether other celestial bodies have magnetic fields was previously unknown. Now, the cosmic rocket passes through the lunar region to detect the Moon's magnetic field, adding one more data point to the original two measurement data points, which is very important. If we have more data, it can help us further understand why the Earth, the Sun, and other celestial bodies have magnetic fields.

The second type is an instrument to investigate the intensity and intensity changes of cosmic rays outside the Earth's magnetic field. This is also a very important task in understanding cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are particles that originate from cosmic space far from the Earth and then are shot to the vicinity of the Earth. Because these particles are charged, they are affected by the Earth's magnetic field during their operation, that is, when they approach the Earth. The three artificial satellites launched by the Soviet Union have found new information about cosmic rays, such as the discovery that the density of cosmic rays is very high in the area quite high above the Earth's surface, which was previously unexpected. Therefore, investigating the intensity and intensity changes of cosmic rays outside the Earth's magnetic field will make an important contribution to understanding where cosmic rays come from.

The third is an instrument to record photons in cosmic rays. This is to observe or record photons other than particles in cosmic rays, which is also an important task to further understand the role and origin of cosmic rays.

The fourth type is an instrument to probe the radioactivity of the Moon, that is, to understand whether the Moon has similarities with us? Our Earth is radioactive, and whether the Moon is radioactive. In the past, because we could not approach the Moon, it was impossible to measure it on Earth. Now, we can take advantage of the cosmic rocket's passage through the lunar region to do the work. Knowing whether the Moon is radioactive can help us further understand the structure of the Moon.

The fifth is an instrument to study the distribution of heavy atomic nuclei in cosmic rays in outer space, that is, outside the influence of the Earth's magnetic field. It is also to solve the problem of the origin of cosmic rays. Because we already have some data on the distribution of atomic nuclei of various substances in interstellar space, if the measurement of the distribution of heavy atomic nuclei in cosmic rays matches the former, then we can say that the production of cosmic rays is due to the action of spatial magnetic fields on the substances in interstellar space, like a large accelerator, so as to obtain a speed close to the speed of light. Therefore, this is also an important task.

The sixth is to study the gaseous composition of interplanetary matter, that is, to understand what the substance of interstellar space is. We usually superficially say that interstellar space is empty, but strictly speaking, it is not absolutely empty. In addition to light, there is always something, but what is the composition of these things? Previously, there was no possibility of direct measurement. Now, with cosmic rockets, it can be directly measured.

The seventh is an instrument to study solar particulate radiation. We know that the temperature of the sun is very high, almost 6,000 degrees. The surface of the sun constantly emits many particles. What are these particles and how are they distributed? In the past, there was no direct way to measure them, because the earth's surface is surrounded by the atmosphere, and we can only infer them indirectly from the various results of its effect on the atmosphere. Now, with cosmic rockets, it can be studied directly.

The eighth is an instrument to study meteor particles. There are constantly meteors in outer space. Generally, meteors are very small and invisible to the naked eye, but they move at a very high speed. Studying them is of certain importance for future space travel, that is, to study what effect they will have if they hit a cosmic rocket or spacecraft, and what their intensity is.

The ninth is an instrument used to create sodium clouds – artificial comets. Sodium is metallic sodium, and sodium clouds are sodium vapor. Before the cosmic rocket approaches the lunar region, it releases a pre-arranged amount of sodium vapor at high altitude. The sodium cloud becomes very bright when stimulated by sunlight in space and is easy to observe. Sodium clouds can serve at least two purposes: one is to study the movement, diffusion, and deformation of sodium vapor in space, and to infer the concentration of matter in the nearby space from this, so as to understand the distribution of matter in interstellar space. Another, as Soviet scientists mentioned, is that if we can make the sodium cloud high enough and rotate around the Earth for 24 hours, so that it looks motionless on Earth, then we can put a few sodium clouds around the world to use it as a television relay station to broadcast television programs around the world. However, the current main purpose is to study the distribution of matter in interstellar space.

Cosmic Rockets Can Reach Other Planets in the Solar System

The fact that the Soviet Union was able to send a cosmic rocket weighing 1472 kilograms, equipped with these instruments, beyond the gravity of the Earth and the Moon at a speed exceeding the second cosmic velocity of 11.2 kilometers, shows that the Soviet Union already has very powerful rocket engines and very accurate control systems. Based on this great achievement, we can say that going to other planets in the solar system is not a distant future thing.

Throughout history, we humans have been confined to the circle of the Earth. Now, once we create the second cosmic velocity and break the shackles of the Earth's gravity, it is like leaving the door, and what our eyes see is a vast world.

The Earth and the Moon are just a small family, and their average distance is only 384,000 kilometers.

Leaving this small family, in the large family of the solar system, the first thing to recognize is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is 149.5 million kilometers, which is 400 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon!

How big is this big family of the solar system? The planet closest to the Sun is Mercury, on the outside is Venus, then Earth, then Mars, then Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and even Pluto. Pluto is the farthest from the Sun, and the average distance between Pluto and the Sun is 40 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun.

We have just been able to get out of our house at the second cosmic speed, is it appropriate to call this rocket a cosmic rocket? It is appropriate. Because the most difficult problem for us is how to get rid of the Earth's gravitational field. Now that we have overcome this difficulty, going to other planets is not difficult.

How so?

As mentioned earlier, the orbit of the cosmic rocket, that is, the artificial planet, is close to the orbit of Mars. After we get rid of the Earth's gravitational field, the further problem is how to overcome the Sun's gravitational field. Although the sun is large, it is far away, and the effect of gravity is not too strong, so it is not too difficult to overcome it. For example, if we really want to go to Mars, what should we do? We can take many methods, some methods are fast, some methods are slow. First, let's talk about a slow and labor-saving method, which is to make the orbit of the artificial planet larger, so that it is both tangent to the orbit of the Earth and tangent to the orbit of Mars. In this way, we can take 237 days to get to Mars along the elliptical orbit. To create such an orbit, we need to make the speed of the artificial planet at the beginning of entering its own orbit after getting rid of the Earth's gravitational field greater than the speed of the Earth's revolution, otherwise it will not be thrown out, but it should not be too large, just faster than 2.3 kilometers per second.

Everyone may say that the second cosmic speed is 11.2 kilometers, and now the speed must be even greater, 2.3 kilometers faster per second, doesn't that require 13.5 kilometers? No, if we let the cosmic rocket escape the Earth's gravitational field at a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, and then add 2.3 kilometers per second to it, the total added speed is indeed 13.5 kilometers per second, but this is not a smart way, because this would require a lot of effort to send the fuel used for acceleration out of the Earth's gravitational field. We can take a more ingenious method, that is, when the cosmic rocket is launched, give it more effort from a low place, let it rush out of the Earth's gravitational field in one breath, and have more remaining power, plus the speed of the Earth's revolution, which is enough to throw the cosmic rocket out to fly to Mars. This is more economical to reduce the weight of the fuel used for acceleration earlier, and the speed does not need 13.5 kilometers, only 11.4 kilometers per second is enough, which is only 200 meters more than the second cosmic speed of 11.2 kilometers. The speed of the cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union is now between 11.2 kilometers and 11.4 kilometers. As long as it is increased a little, it can go to Mars.

Mars is of more interest to us. Because the conditions on this planet are not bad, and people can probably tolerate it. The temperature is quite comfortable. The highest temperature in summer there is 30 degrees Celsius, which is a bit hot. Mars also has an atmosphere, but it is thinner than on Earth. The atmospheric pressure on its surface is one-tenth of that on Earth. The composition of the air is different from that on our Earth. It is basically nitrogen, accounting for more than 90%, and contains a little water and oxygen, so the surface of Mars is relatively dry. It is farther from the sun, 52% farther than Earth. A year on Mars is longer, 687 Earth days; however, a day on Mars is about the same as ours, 24.6 hours. The diameter of Mars is only a little more than half of Earth's, it is relatively small, and its mass is only about one-tenth of Earth's. Under these circumstances, there is a feature, that is, it is easier to build artificial satellites on Mars. The first cosmic velocity on Mars is only 3.6 kilometers per second, and the second cosmic velocity is only 5.1 kilometers per second.

This is going to Mars outside the Earth's orbit. Can we go to Mercury and Venus inside the Earth's orbit? Yes, as long as the speed of the cosmic rocket after getting rid of the Earth's gravitational field is reduced a little compared to the speed of the Earth's revolution. How to reduce it? That is, when launching the cosmic rocket, the speed should be slightly greater than 11.2 kilometers, so that after getting rid of the Earth's gravitational field, there is still a little remaining speed. The direction of this speed should be opposite to the speed of the Earth's orbit around the sun, so that the final speed relative to the sun is equal to the speed of the Earth's orbit around the sun minus this speed. This means that if we also want to launch in the direction of the moon, we cannot launch during the last quarter of the moon, but during the first quarter, when the moon is walking behind the Earth's orbit around the sun. In this way, when the cosmic rocket gets rid of the Earth's gravitational field, it will be slower than the speed of the Earth's orbit around the sun, and then the cosmic rocket will fall into the Earth's inner circle. In doing so, the launch speed of the cosmic rocket required can also be calculated. To go to Venus, it takes 11.5 kilometers per second. To go to Mercury, because it is farther inside than Venus, falls even deeper, and decelerates even more, that is, it requires it to have a greater speed in the opposite direction after getting rid of the Earth's gravitational field, so its launch speed must be faster, requiring 12.7 kilometers per second.

Mercury may not be of much interest to us, because it is too close to the sun, and it is terribly hot. Due to the very strong tidal effect of the sun for many years, its rotation speed is getting slower and slower, and its period of rotation is gradually the same as its period of revolution, like the moon, always facing the sun with one side. It is already close to the sun, only 39% of the distance between the Earth and the sun. When it is baked like this, the temperature above its equator is so high that it can melt lead. So to go to Mercury, we can only stay near the poles. Its volume is relatively small, and its mass is only 40% of the Earth's mass. In this case, there is a characteristic, that is, the air on its surface has almost run away. According to careful research now, there is still a little bit of air, but it is pitifully small. The atmospheric pressure on its surface is only one-thousandth of that on Earth.

Outside of Mercury is Venus, which may be of great interest to us. Because it looks similar to Earth, its mass is 81% of Earth's, and its diameter is 93% of Earth's. It has a thick atmosphere, and its highest temperature is 60 degrees Celsius, but most of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, and it has not been measured how much oxygen there is. This situation is similar to that of the Earth in ancient times. Studying Venus may be like reviewing the history of the Earth tens of millions of years ago.

Let's take a look at the outer ring of the Earth. Outside of Mars, there are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. These four planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, have similarities. They are all much smaller in average density than Earth. For example, the average specific gravity of Earth is 5.52, while Jupiter is 1.34, Uranus is 1.27, and Neptune is 1.58. Saturn is even stranger, it is 0.71, lighter than water. Their volumes are very large. Jupiter is the king of the planets, its diameter is 11 times that of Earth, Saturn is 8 times, Uranus is 4 times, and Neptune is also almost 4 times. These stars are not basically rocks like Earth, but basically hydrogen. The conditions on these planets are simply unimaginable. The temperature on Jupiter is -138℃, Saturn is -153℃, Uranus is -184℃, and Neptune is even colder, -201℃. On these planets, hydrogen is liquefied and pressed under the atmosphere. Its sea is liquid hydrogen, and the land is solid hydrogen. The closer to the center, the greater the pressure. Some people say that when the pressure increases to 800,000 atmospheres, solid hydrogen turns into metallic hydrogen, which is a bit unimaginable. Only Pluto has a structure similar to Earth, and the temperature has now been measured to be -211℃. It looks like it has a higher density. Besides, not much is known about it, because it is very small and very far away.

To go to these planets, there are also places that can be used, that is, they have more satellites. We can go to those satellites first, such as Jupiter has 11 satellites, Saturn has 9, Uranus has 4, Neptune has 1 (maybe there are more, not yet found, because it is too far away), and whether Pluto has satellites has not yet been found. If you can go, standing on these satellites, looking at these planets, they are so big, almost covering half the sky, it is really a spectacle. And these planets are very bright, brighter than the moon. The moon can reflect 7% of sunlight, and these planets can reflect 50%.

It is not too difficult to go to these planets, and the required speed can also be calculated. Because they are farther away from each other, our speed when we go is also greater than each other. To go to Jupiter, it takes 14.3 kilometers per second, to Saturn it takes 15.1 kilometers, to Uranus it takes 15.9 kilometers, to Neptune it takes 16.5 kilometers, and to Pluto it also takes 16.5 kilometers, because Pluto's orbit is elliptical, and part of it almost overlaps with Neptune's.

Although, we know that if we add a little bit to the speed of going to Pluto, at 16.5 kilometers per second, plus 200 meters, it is equal to 16.7 kilometers, which is the third cosmic speed, and we can run out of the solar system. However, there is a small problem in the middle, that is, there is a large group of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. Some people estimate that there are about 40,000. If a cosmic rocket wants to pass through these small stars, it will inevitably have some twists and turns.

From some of the above, the Soviet cosmic rocket can solve the problem of going to planets closer to the Earth. Because to go to Mars and Venus, it only needs to increase a little bit compared to the speed of the current cosmic rocket, which Soviet rocket technology can do.

Scientific Achievements of the Soviet Cosmic Rocket

Now we talk about the first, second, and third cosmic speeds, and we may not fully appreciate the difficulty of achieving these speeds. To have a deep understanding, we must look at the kinetic energy represented by this speed. First, we look at the kinetic energy between the first cosmic speed of 8 kilometers per second and the second cosmic speed of 11.2 kilometers per second. The actual increase in kinetic energy in the middle is not a small part, but it must be compared by the square of 8 kilometers and the square of 11.2 kilometers. In this way, the kinetic energy represented by the second cosmic speed is exactly twice the kinetic energy represented by the first cosmic speed, and the kinetic energy represented by the third cosmic speed is 4.5 times the kinetic energy represented by the first cosmic speed, which is almost exactly twice the kinetic energy represented by the second cosmic speed. From the first cosmic speed to the second cosmic speed, from the second cosmic speed to the third cosmic speed, there are sectional changes in the middle, and each must be increased.

From this, we can know why we say that the Soviet Union, after achieving the first cosmic speed, achieved the second cosmic speed in just over a year. This is very difficult, because its difficulty is measured by the size of the kinetic energy.

To further understand the difficulty of reaching cosmic speeds, we can use common things as a comparison. For example, the speed of a train is 70 kilometers per hour. To compare with the first cosmic speed of 8 kilometers per second, the kinetic energy represented by the latter is 170,000 times that of the former, and the kinetic energy represented by the second cosmic speed of 11.2 kilometers will be doubled, which is 340,000 times. Therefore, it is not difficult to drive the train to the maximum speed, but to achieve the first and second cosmic speeds is a great achievement in science.

From this, we can understand why the power machinery that pushes the cosmic rocket is so huge. A locomotive is only one-fiftieth of the weight of the train! But we are not talking about the problem of locomotives, but the problem of launching artificial satellites and cosmic rockets with kinetic energy that is hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands of times greater than what the locomotive can add. The pushing mechanism is always much larger than the pushed mechanism. Therefore, the weight of the multi-stage rocket that launches artificial satellites and cosmic rockets is truly shockingly large when it takes off.

Based on existing data, we can roughly say that the speed that each stage of the rocket can produce is equal to the jet speed of the rocket; that is, for each additional stage of the rocket, the speed is added by one jet speed. In addition, the weight ratio of each stage of the rocket to its previous stage is ten to one.

Now, let's take a look at the jet speed of rocket engines. To use general fuel, such as liquid oxygen and alcohol, the jet speed per second is 2.6-2.8; if you use good fuel with more energy, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid fluorine, some people have calculated that it can reach 4 kilometers per second; using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, some people have also calculated that it can also reach almost 4 kilometers per second.

In this way, if you want to use general fuel to reach the first cosmic speed, it cannot be a one- or two-stage rocket, but two or three stages. The weight ratio of each stage to the previous stage is ten to one, which means that if the final effective weight pushed is 1 kilogram, then the third stage is 10, the second stage is 100, and the first stage is 1000 kilograms, that is, one ton. If you want to reach the second cosmic speed, I am afraid that it cannot be solved by a three-stage rocket, at least four stages are required. If you want to reach the third cosmic speed, then it is not four stages, but six stages. If it is six stages, then the ratio is still amazing, it is one to one million, that is, to send one kilogram of object out of the solar system, you need a rocket weighing one thousand tons.

Of course, if you use high-energy fuel and the jet speed reaches 4 kilometers per second, this ratio can be reduced. Then the satellite is not one to one thousand, but one to one hundred, and the cosmic rocket is not one to one thousand, but one to one hundred.

From this, it seems that the cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union now uses high-energy fuel, and the multi-stage rocket at take-off must not weigh tens of tons, but hundreds of tons, maybe four hundred tons! And the thrust of a four-hundred-ton multi-stage rocket is much greater than this, and may require a thrust of six hundred tons. Therefore, the launch of a cosmic rocket cannot only see how heavy it sends up, but also see its take-off weight.

The problem is not limited to this, we also have to study how to control the orbit of the rocket, there must be precise control. During World War II, the Nazi government of Hitler launched the V2 rocket, which only weighed twelve tons, had a thrust of only twenty-seven tons, a range of less than three hundred kilometers, and was not accurate even in this three hundred kilometer range. The error of the landing point could reach four kilometers. That was in 1942-1943.

From that time on, Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers, in less than a dozen years, were able to improve the technology and control technology of rockets to such a high level today. The estimated weight of the launched rocket is not tens of tons, but hundreds of tons, if ordinary fuel is used, it may be thousands of tons. And launching such a rocket is not just launched casually, like what the United States does, it goes up and then falls down; but it is controlled very precisely, with precise control at every point on the launch orbit that is thousands of kilometers long; when each stage is ignited and turned off, and how to correct the orbit if it deviates, these all require very fast, very sensitive, and very accurate automatic control systems.

Whether in terms of the degree of difficulty or the amount of work required, this work is unimaginable. For example, here is a reference figure. In the year after the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite, the United States spent six billion US dollars on launching artificial satellites. Of course, this is not worth learning, most of the money spent by capitalist countries goes into the pockets of capitalists, but from this we can also see some situations, and we can imagine that it is indeed not easy for the Soviet Union to launch such a large artificial satellite and cosmic rocket. Engaging in such a career is by no means something that a few people can undertake. It is necessary to mobilize scientific and technical personnel across the country to engage in national cooperation; if it is not one out of every 10 people, it is much more than one out of every 100 people; not only must there be a large team, but also a plan, steps, and hard work to achieve this goal.

The great achievement of launching a cosmic rocket is indeed the result of how much hard work and arduous work the Soviet working people have put in. It is also a great achievement made by all the Soviet people under the leadership of the Soviet Party, guided by Marxist-Leninist thought, for the happiness of all mankind.

Our Chinese scientific workers and comrades must also learn from the Soviet Union. They are our shining example.

    谈宇宙火箭和星际飞行
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    编者按：1月8日，中国科学院力学研究所所长钱学森在北京作了一次关于苏联宇宙火箭问题的报告。这个报告对苏联宇宙火箭的运行情况、宇宙火箭担任的科学研究任务、太阳系各个行星的概况、如何利用宇宙火箭到达太阳系其它行星，以及苏联发射宇宙火箭在科学上的伟大成就，作了比较系统的通俗的解释。为了帮助读者了解这些问题，特将报告整理发表。
    苏联宇宙火箭的运行
    我们都知道，苏联在人造卫星、星际航行这方面是付出了巨大的劳动的，他们在这方面技术上已达到最先进水平的。
    苏联在一年多以前，也就是1957年10月4日放出了全世界第一个人造卫星，它的重量是83.6公斤；一个月之后，1957年11月3日，又放出一个更大更重的人造卫星，重508.3公斤；而去年5月又放出了第三个人造卫星，这的确可以说是巨大的人造卫星，因为它的重量已超过了一吨，是1327公斤。这一系列的成就，说明了苏联在星际航行的技术上，已经走出第一步；也就是已经能够把超出一吨重的物体，用强力的火箭发动机推送出去，达到第一宇宙速度，即每秒钟8公里左右的这样一个速度。
    苏联在这个基础上，继续工作，继续提高火箭发动机的威力，继续把火箭的自动控制系统搞得更精密。又隔了几个月，距离发射第一个人造卫星一年多一点，在今年的1月2日，莫斯科时间大约晚上八点钟左右，也就是莫斯科城市居民刚刚吃过晚饭，西伯利亚地区差不多午夜的时候，在发射场上，升起了巨大的火箭，宇宙火箭开始起飞了！
    这一发射时间，是完全经过仔细安排好了的。1月2日，正是“下弦”，正当月球走到地球绕太阳公转的轨道前面，宇宙火箭的发射，就是要选择这样的时候，让它从月球区域的左面穿过，跑到地球绕太阳公转的轨道前面去。
    所以，当它克服了地球和月球的引力之后，它在宇宙空间的速度，也就是对太阳来说的速度，应该是它克服了地球和月球的引力之后的余速，加上地球绕太阳公转的速度。我们知道，地球绕太阳公转的速度，差不多是每秒30公里，那么，这时候，人造行星的速度就是每秒钟30公里多。而由于它的速度比地球绕太阳公转的速度多一点，因此，它的运行的轨道也就比地球绕太阳公转的轨道大一些，而介乎地球轨道和火星绕太阳公转的轨道之间。
    人造行星的轨道是椭圆的，最大的直径是3亿4千3百6十万公里，它的公转的周期差不多是15个月，更具体地说是450个地球日，它的椭圆轨道的偏心率，也就是椭圆的程度是0.148。既然轨道是椭圆的，就有一个长轴、一个短轴。地球的轨道也是这样，是椭圆的、有长轴、短轴。人造行星轨道的长轴和地球轨道的长轴，有一个角度，是15度，但是两个轨道是在同一平面上的。
    宇宙火箭——人造行星完全脱离地球和月球引力而进入自己围绕太阳公转轨道的时刻，大约是1月7日至8日。它将在1月14日走到轨道上的近日点，距离太阳据估计大约为一亿四千六百四十万公里，那时它的速度将是每秒32公里；今年9月初，它将走到轨道上的远日点，距离太阳据估计为一亿九千七百万公里，那时它的速度将是每秒27.75公里。
    从这个轨道的特性，我们可以知道，人造行星轨道和火星轨道之间最小的距离是一千五百万公里。这个距离听起来好像很大，实际上只占地球离火星最近时距离的四分之一。
    据计算，这个宇宙火箭变成的人造行星，将要在大约五年后重新接近地球。大家不要害怕，它不会跑到地球的空气层里来，因为那时它离地球虽说是比较接近，而距离还要几千万公里哩！
    苏联宇宙火箭的科学研究任务
    当然，苏联发射宇宙火箭，不仅是使它成为人造行星；还有许多要进行的研究工作。
    首先，是研究怎样具体达到第二宇宙速度，即脱离地球引力场需要每秒钟十一点二公里速度所关系的一系列动力上的和控制上的问题。
    此外，宇宙火箭上还装载了许多精密的科学测量仪器，这些仪器和无线电发报机以及电源设备，一共重三百六十一点三公斤，这可以说是宇宙火箭的有效负载，它的最后真正执行任务的部分。
    发射宇宙火箭，用的当然是多级火箭。其最后一级包括装载的仪器等，计重一千四百七十二公斤，比第三个人造卫星还要多一百四十五公斤。这还是燃料用完了之后的重量，如包括原来携带的燃料，则重量还要大。所以说苏联发射这样一个宇宙火箭的工具，乃是一个威力非常大的工具。
    担任进行测量的仪器一共有九种：
    一种是探测月球磁场的仪器。为什么要测量月球磁场呢？因为我们对天体磁场知道得还很少。当然，我们住在地球上，对地球的磁场是知道了，对太阳的也知道，但是其他天体是否有磁场，这在以前我们是不知道的，现在由宇宙火箭经过月球区域，探测月球的磁场，这样就可使原来仅有的两个测量数据上又加上一个数据，这是很重要的事情。假如我们有更多的数据，就可以帮助我们进一步了解地球、太阳和其他天体为什么会有磁场的问题。
    第二种是在地球磁场以外考察宇宙线的强度和强度变化的仪器。这也是了解宇宙线方面的一个很重要的工作。宇宙线是从远离地球的宇宙空间产生，然后射到地球附近来的粒子，由于这些粒子是带电的，因此在运行过程中也就是在接近地球时，就受到地球磁场的作用。苏联发射的三个人造卫星，就曾找出了关于宇宙线的新资料，如发现了在地表上空相当高的地方宇宙线的密度很高，这是以前未曾想到的。因此，在地球磁场以外考察宇宙线的强度和强度变化，对于了解宇宙线到底是怎么来的，将会有重要的贡献。
    第三种是纪录宇宙线中的光子的仪器。即观测或纪录宇宙线中除粒子以外的光子，这也是进一步了解宇宙线的作用和起源的重要工作。
    第四种是探查月球的放射性的仪器，即是要了解月球到底是否有和我们相似之处？我们地球上有放射性，月球是否有放射性。这在以前因未能接近月球，在地球上无法测量，现在，正好利用宇宙火箭的穿过月球区域来做工作，知道了月球是否有放射性，可帮助我们进一步了解月球的构造。
    第五种是研究在宇宙空间也就是在地球磁场影响之外的宇宙线中重原子核的分布的仪器。也是为了解决宇宙线的产生的问题。因为我们已经对星际空间各种物质的原子核的分布有了一些数据，如果测量出宇宙线中的重原子核的分布与前者相合的话，那么我们就更可以说，宇宙线的产生是由于星际空间的物质受了空间磁场的作用，好像一个大加速器一样，从而得到接近于光的速度。所以，这也是一件重要的工作。
    第六种是研究行星际物质的气体成分，也就是要了解星际空间的物质到底是什么？我们通常粗浅地说，星际空间是空的，但认真地说来，并不是绝对空的，除了光之外，多少总有些东西，但这些东西是何成分，以前没有直接测量的可能，现在有了宇宙火箭就可直接测量了。
    第七种是研究太阳微粒辐射的仪器。我们知道，太阳的温度很高，差不多有6千度，太阳的表面不断地放出很多微粒子，这些微粒子到底是什么、它的分布如何？这在以前没有什么直接测量的办法，因为地表面为大气层包围，只能从它对大气层作用的各种结果来间接推论。现在有了宇宙火箭就可以直接研究它了。
    第八种是研究流星粒子的仪器。在宇宙空间中不断地有流星，一般流星是很小的，肉眼看不见，但是运动的速度很大，研究它对于将来宇宙航行是有一定的重要性的，也就是要研究它如果撞到宇宙火箭或飞船上将会起什么样的作用以及它的强度如何。
    第九种是用于制造钠云——人造彗星的仪器。钠是金属钠，钠云即钠的蒸气。在宇宙火箭接近月球区域以前还在高空时，就放出预先安排好了的一定量的钠的蒸气，钠云在空间受到日光的刺激，可以变得很亮，很容易观测到。钠云可至少起两种作用：一种是研究钠的蒸气在空间的移动，扩散和变形，由此推论其附近空间物质的浓度有多大，从而了解星际空间物质的分布情况。还有一种，苏联科学家曾提到了，即如果我们能使钠云有足够的高度，并且24小时绕地球转一圈，这样在地球上看起来，钠云就是不动的，那么在全球弄上几块钠云，就可以利用它做电视反射站，在全世界范围内播送电视节目了。不过，当前主要还是为了研究星际空间物质的分布。
  利用宇宙火箭可达太阳系其他行星
    苏联能够把装有这些仪器的重达1472公斤的宇宙火箭，以超过第二宇宙速度的11.2公里的速度，送出地球和月球的引力之外，这说明了苏联已经有了非常强大的火箭发动机、非常准确的控制系统。根据这一伟大成就，我们可以说，到太阳系其他行星上去，已经不是很遥远的将来的事情了。
    有史以来，我们人类被局限在地球这个圈子里，现在，我们一旦创造了第二宇宙速度，打破地球的引力的束缚，就如同出了大门，眼睛所看到的是广阔的世界。
    地球和月球，这只不过是个小家庭，它们的平均距离只是38万4千公里。
    走出这个小家庭，在太阳系的大家庭里，首先要认识一下地球和太阳的距离。地球和太阳的平均距离是1亿4千9百5十万公里，这个距离就是地球和月球的距离的400倍了！
    太阳系这个大家庭到底有多大呢？离太阳最近的行星是水星，靠外边是金星，再外边是地球，再外边是火星，再外边是木星、土星、天王星、海王星、以至冥王星，离太阳最远的是冥王星，而冥王星和太阳的平均距离则又是地球和太阳平均距离的40倍。
    我们刚刚能以第二宇宙速度走出家门，就把这个火箭叫做宇宙火箭，是否恰当呢？是恰当的。因为我们最困难的问题就是怎样摆脱地球的引力场，现在克服了这个困难，到其他星球上去是不难的。
    这话怎讲？
    前面说过，宇宙火箭也就是人造行星的轨道，接近火星的轨道。我们摆脱了地球的引力场之后，进一步的问题，就是如何战胜太阳的引力场。太阳虽然大，但是距离远，引力的作用不是太强的，战胜它不太难。举个例子，譬如我们真正要到火星上去，怎么办呢？我们可以采取许多办法，有的办法快，有的办法慢。先说一种慢而省力的办法，就是使人造行星的轨道再大一些，使它既和地球的轨道相切，又和火星的轨道相切，这样就可沿着椭圆轨道，用237天的时间到火星上去。要造成这样一个轨道，就要使人造行星在摆脱地球引力场之后开始进入自己轨道的速度，比地球公转的速度更大一些，不然甩不出去，但也不要太大，只要快个每秒2.3公里就行了。
    大家也许会这样说，第二宇宙速度是11.2公里，现在速度还要更大一些，每秒快2.3公里，那不就是需要13.5公里了吗？不是的，假如我们让宇宙火箭以每秒钟11.2公里的速度，摆脱地球的引力场，再给它加上每秒2.3公里的速度，加的总速度诚然是每秒13.5公里，但这不是聪明的办法，因为这样就得要连加速用的燃料也费很大的力气送到地球引力场之外去。我们可以采取更巧妙的方法，即在宇宙火箭发射时，由低处给它多加把劲儿，让它一口气冲出地球的引力场，还能多剩余些力量，再加上地球公转时的速度，就足可以把宇宙火箭甩出去，飞往火星，这样把加速用的燃料所占的重量，早些减掉，比较经济，而速度也就不需要13.5公里，只要每秒11.4公里就够了，也就是只要比第二宇宙速度的11.2公里再多200公尺就行了。苏联现在发射的宇宙火箭的速度，已经在11.2公里与11.4公里之间，只要再加上一点点，就可以到火星上去了。
    火星，对我们来说，是比较感兴趣的。因为，这个行星上的条件还不算坏，人大概还可以受得了，温度是满舒服的；它那里的夏天最高温度有摄氏30度，比较热一些。火星上也有大气，只是比地球上稀薄，它表面的大气压力为地球上的十分之一。空气的成分和我们地球上不一样，基本上是氮气，占90％以上，里边含有一点水分和氧气，所以火星的表面是比较干燥的。它离太阳较远，比地球要远52％。火星的一年较长，为六百八十七个地球日；不过火星上的一天还和我们差不多，是24.6小时。火星的直径只有地球的一半多一点，比较小，质量也大约只有地球的十分之一。在这种情况下，有一个特点，就是如果在火星上搞人造卫星比较容易，火星上的第一宇宙速度只是每秒3.6公里，第二宇宙速度只是每秒5.1公里。
    这是到地球外圈的火星上去，我们能不能到地球里圈的水星、金星上去呢？也可以，只要使宇宙火箭在摆脱地球的引力场之后所具有的速度，比地球公转的速度再减少一些就行了。怎样减少呢？就是在发射宇宙火箭时，速度要比11.2公里略大些，使它在摆脱地球引力场之后，还有一点余速，这点速度的方向要和地球绕太阳的速度相反，使得最后相对于太阳的速度等于地球绕太阳的速度减去这点速度。这就是说如果也要向月球方向发射，就不能在下弦的时候，而要在上弦的时候发射，这时月球正走在地球绕太阳公转的轨道后边。这样，当宇宙火箭摆脱地球引力场之后，就会比地球绕太阳公转的速度慢些，于是，宇宙火箭就会掉在地球的里圈里。这样做，所需要的宇宙火箭的发射速度也是可以计算得出来的。到金星上去，需要每秒11.5公里。到水星上去，因为它比金星还靠里，掉得还要深，减速还要多，也就是要求它在摆脱地球引力场之后朝着相反方向的速度还要大些，所以它的发射速度也要更快些，需要每秒12.7公里。
    水星对我们来说，兴趣也许不太大，因为它离太阳太近了，烫得不得了，由于多年以来，受着太阳的很强的潮汐作用，自转的速度越来越慢，和公转的周期逐渐相同，像月亮似的，永远以一面向着太阳，离太阳本来就近，只有地球和太阳的距离的39％，再这样一烤，它赤道上边的温度就高得厉害，能熔化铅。所以到水星上去，只好在两极附近呆着，它的体积又较小，质量只有地球质量的40％，这样一来，在它表面上的空气就跑得差不多了，据现在仔细的研究，也还有一点点空气，但少得可怜，它地表面的大气压力仅有地球上的千分之一。
    水星的外圈是金星，金星对我们来说可能很有兴趣。因为，它看起来和地球相似，质量是地球的81％，直径是地球的93％，它上边有浓厚的大气，最高温度是摄氏60度，不过大气的大部分都是二氧化碳，还测不到有多少氧气，这种情况跟地球在太古洪荒时差不多，研究金星，可能像是温习一番地球的几千万年前的历史。
    我们再看一看地球的外圈，火星之外，就是木星、土星、天王星、海王星、冥王星。木、土、天王、海王这四个行星，有其类似的地方，都是平均密度比地球小得多，譬如，地球的平均比重是5.52，木星则是1.34，天王星是1.27，海王星是1.58，土星就更怪了，是0.71，比水还轻。它们的体积则很大，木星是行星中的大王，直径是地球的11倍，土星是8倍，天王星是4倍，海王星也差不多是4倍。这些星不像地球似的基本上是石头，而基本上都是氢气。这些行星上的条件，简直令人不可想像，木星上的温度是—138℃，土星是—153℃，天王星是—184℃，海王星就更冷了，是—201℃。在这些行星上，氢气都液化了，压在大气层底下，它的海是液体氢，地是固体氢，越往中心，压力越大，有人说，压力加大到80万个大气压，固体氢竟变成了金属氢，这真有点难以想像。只有冥王星和地球的结构差不多，温度现已量出来是—211℃，看起来密度比较大，此外还知道得不多，因为它很小而距离非常远。
    到这些行星上去，也有可以利用的地方，就是它们有较多的卫星，可以先到那些卫星上去，如木星有11个卫星，土星有9个，天王星有4个，海王星有1个（也许还有，还未找到，因为太远了），冥王星是否有卫星，也还未找到。假如能够去，站在这些卫星上，看看这些行星，都是那么大，几乎遮了半边天，真是奇观。而且这些行星都非常亮，比月球还亮，月球能反射7％的日光，这些行星能反射50％。
    到这些行星上去，也不太难，所需要的速度也是可以计算出来的，因为它们一个比一个远，所以我们去时的速度也一个比一个大，去木星要每秒14.3公里，去土星要15.1公里，去天王星要15.9公里，去海王星要16.5公里，去冥王星也要16.5公里，因冥王星的轨道是椭圆的，有一部分几乎和海王星相重。
    虽然，我们知道，在去冥王星的速度上，再加上一点点，在每秒16.5公里，加上200公尺，就等于16.7公里，也就是第三宇宙速度，就可以跑出太阳系。不过，这中间还有个小问题，就是火星和木星之间有一大群小行星，有人估计约四万多个，宇宙火箭要穿过这些小星，难免有些波折。
    从上面所讲的一些来看，苏联宇宙火箭已可以解决到离地球较近的行星上去的问题。因为到火星、金星上去，只需要比现在宇宙火箭的速度再增加一点点，是苏联火箭技术可以做到的。
      苏联宇宙火箭的科学成就
  现在我们讲到第一、第二、第三宇宙速度，我们也许不大体会达到这样一些速度的困难。要想得到深刻的体会，必须从这个速度所代表的动能来看。首先，我们看由第一宇宙速度每秒8公里到第二宇宙速度11.2公里，这中间的动能实际增加的并不是很小的部分，而是要以8公里的平方和11.2公里的平方来比，这样，第二宇宙速度所代表的动能就恰恰是第一宇宙速度所代表的动能的两倍，而第三宇宙速度所代表的动能则又是第一宇宙速度所代表的动能的4.5倍，也就是差不多又正是第二宇宙速度所代表的动能的两倍。从第一宇宙速度到第二宇宙速度，从第二宇宙速度到第三宇宙速度，中间是节段性的变化，都要增加一番。
    由此可以知道，为什么我们说苏联在实现了第一宇宙速度之后，仅一年多一点，又实现了第二宇宙速度，这是非常不容易的，原因就是它的艰巨性是要以动能的大小来衡量的。
    要进一步了解达到宇宙速度的困难，可以举我们常见的事物做对比，如火车每小时的速度是70公里，要跟第一宇宙速度每秒8公里来比，后者所代表的动能就要为前者的17万倍，而第二宇宙速度11.2公里所代表的动能还要翻一番，是34万倍。所以，要把火车开到最大的速度并不难，而要达到第一、第二宇宙速度，在科学上就是极大成就。
    由此，可以理解，为什么推动宇宙火箭的动力机械是那样的非常庞大，一个火车头不过是列车重量的五十分之一罢！可是我们要谈的不是火车头的问题，而是比火车头所能加的动能要大十几万、几十万倍的发射人造卫星、宇宙火箭的问题，推动的机构总是要比被推动的机构大得多，因此，发射人造卫星、宇宙火箭的多级火箭，它在起飞时的重量，那真是大得惊人的。
    根据现有的资料，我们可以大约的说，每一级火箭它能够产生的速度，是等于火箭的喷气速度；也就是说每多一级火箭，速度就加一个喷气速度。此外，每级火箭与它上一级的重量比是十比一。
    现在，让我们看一看火箭发动机的喷气速度。要用一般的燃料，如液氧、酒精，每秒的喷气速度为2.6—2.8；如用好的能量更大的燃料，如液氢、液氟，有人计算过，说可达到每秒4公里；用液氧、液氢，也有人计算过，也差不多可以达到每秒4公里。
    这样，如果用一般燃料要达到第一宇宙速度，就不能是一、二级火箭，而得二、三级。每一级对上一级的重量比是十比一，也就是说，如最后被推送的有效重量为1公斤，那么第三级就是10，第二级就是100，而第一级就是1000公斤，也就是一吨。如果要达到第二宇宙速度，恐怕就不是三级火箭能解决的了，起码也得四级。如果要达到第三宇宙速度，那就不是四级，而要六级。六级的话，那比例还了得，就是一比一百万，也就是要把一公斤的物体送出太阳系，需要一千吨重的火箭。
    当然，要用高能燃料，喷气速度达到每秒四公里的话，这比例就可减少一些。则放卫星就不是一比一千，而是一比一百，放宇宙火箭就不是一比一万，而是一比一千。
    由此看来苏联现在所放的宇宙火箭，就是用高能燃料，起飞时的多级火箭一定不是几十吨重，而是几百吨重，可能是四百吨罢！而四百吨的多级火箭被推上去，其推力还要比这个大得多，可能要有六百吨的推力。所以，发射宇宙火箭这件事，不能只看到它送上去的是多重，而是还要看到它起飞的重量。
    问题还不止于此，我们还得研究如何控制火箭的轨道，必须有精密的控制。二次大战时，希特勒纳粹政府曾放过V2火箭，它只有十二吨重，推力只有二十七吨，射程不到三百公里，而且就在这三百公里的射程中还瞄不准，落弹点的误差可达到四公里。那是1942—1943年的事了。
    从那时代起，苏联科学家、工程师、工人，用了不到十几年的功夫，就能够把火箭的技术和控制的技术提高到今天这样的高度，发射火箭的估计重量不是几十吨，而是成百吨，如用普通燃料，可能几千吨。而且放这样的火箭不是随便放上去，像美国搞的，上去又掉下来；而是控制得非常精确，在长到几千公里的发射轨道上，每一点都有精密控制；哪级何时点火、熄火，轨道偏了如何校正，这都是需要用很快、很敏感，很准确的自动控制系统。
    这一工作无论从其困难的程度和所需要工作量来说，我们不易想像到底有多大。比如，举这样一个参考数字，美国在苏联发射成功第一个人造卫星之后，在一年内，他在对于发射人造卫星这上面，就花了六十亿美元。当然，这是不足为训的了，资本主义国家花钱，大部分跑到资本家口袋里去了，但由此我们也可看到一些情况，可以想见，像苏联这样发射这么大的人造卫星、宇宙火箭，的确不简单。从事这样一个事业，那绝非是少数人所能承担得了的，必须动员全国科学技术人员，搞全国大协作；如果不是每10个人中有一个，那也比每100个人中有一个要多得多；不但要有一个大队伍，而且要有计划、有步骤地，经过艰苦的劳动，才能达成这个目标。
    发射宇宙火箭这一伟大的成就，的确是苏联劳动人民花了多少辛勤劳动，做了多少坚苦卓绝的工作，才取得的。这也是全体苏联人民，在苏联党的领导下，在马克思列宁思想做为指导下，为了全人类的幸福而立下的丰功伟绩。
    我们中国的全体科学工作者同志们，也要好好地学习苏联，他们是我们光辉的榜样。
