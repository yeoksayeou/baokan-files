    Discussion on Revolutionary Realism and Revolutionary Romanticism

    Since Chairman Mao proposed that our literature should be a "creative method combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism," enthusiastic discussions have been展开的 throughout the country in various newspapers and periodicals over the past few months. In the capital, the "Wenyi Bao" editorial department has already held seven discussion meetings, and the "Wenyi Bao" (from issue 22 to 24 in 1958) has continuously published six articles. The issue has deepened into discussions about creating new heroic characters. There are some divergent views in the discussion.

    "Renmin Wenxue" published Comrade Guo Moruo's "Answering Questions from the Editors of 'Renmin Wenxue' on Several Issues in Current Creative Work" in its January issue this year. This article also expresses opinions on many issues in this discussion. The article puts forward clear views on the relationship between the slogan "combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism" and the slogan "socialist realism," the literary tradition of combining romanticism and realism, and how writers can master this creative method. The article also criticizes some mechanical and one-sided views in the discussion (such as the view that the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism should be 50% to 50%, etc.). This article is helpful for further展開的 the discussion on this issue. (Yi)

    Improvements to "Yiwen"

    Since the second half of last year, "Yiwen," a magazine mainly introducing foreign literature, has quickly adapted to the needs of the internal and external situation, facing the boiling life of China's Great Leap Forward, the undercurrents of revisionism in the international literary and art circles, and the urgent need of the majority of readers to explore world modern literature, greatly improving the magazine's realism and combat effectiveness.

    In order to support the struggles of the Asian and African people spiritually and culturally, "Yiwen" published a "Special Issue on Asian and African Literature" in September and October, and in December it selected and published the "Letter to World Writers from the Asian-African Writers' Conference" and part of the speeches at the conference. The above works and documents are full of the Asian and African people's will to fight against imperialism.

    In the past year, "Yiwen" has strengthened the commentary work on foreign literature, criticized international reactionary literary and artistic thoughts, and introduced modern advanced literary theories. All these have helped to eliminate the poison of reactionary literature and resist the influence of revisionist literature on a worldwide scale. At the same time, in response to the needs of our country to build socialist literature, it has very timely introduced the advanced experience of socialist countries (mainly the Soviet Union) literature, giving us a lot of help.

    We expect that "Shijie Wenxue," the new name of "Yiwen" starting this year, will have a greater leap forward in strengthening realism and combat effectiveness.

### 关于革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的讨论

    关于革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的讨论
    自从毛主席提出了我们的文学应该是“革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合的创作方法”，几个月来全国各地报刊展开了热烈的讨论。在首都，“文艺报”编辑部已经召开了七次讨论会，“文艺报”上（从1958年第二十二期到二十四期）连续发表了六篇文章，问题已经深入到有关创造新英雄人物的讨论。讨论中间很有些分歧的看法。
    “人民文学”今年一月号上，发表了郭沫若同志的“就目前创作中的几个问题答‘人民文学’编者问”。这篇文章也正是针对这个讨论中的许多问题发表意见。文章就“革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合”的口号与“社会主义现实主义”口号的关系、浪漫主义和现实主义相结合的文学传统以及作家如何掌握这一创作方法等问题，都提出了明确的看法。文章还就讨论中的一些机械、片面的看法（如认为革命浪漫主义和革命现实主义相结合，要50％对50％等看法），提出了批评的意见。这篇文章对于进一步展开关于这个问题的讨论很有帮助。　（伊）
    “译文”的改进
    去年下半年以来，“译文”这个以介绍外国文学为主的刊物，它面对着中国大跃进的沸腾生活，面对着国际间文艺界修正主义的暗流，面对着广大读者对于探讨世界现代文学的迫切需要，很快地适应了内外形势的这一需要，大大提高了刊物的现实性和战斗性。
    为了在精神与文化上支援亚非人民的斗争，“译文”在9、10两月出版了“亚非国家文学专号”，12月又选刊了“亚非国家作家会议告世界作家书”以及会议上的一部分发言，以上的这些作品和文献，充满了亚非人民反对帝国主义的斗争意志。
      “译文”在过去的一年中，加强了外国文学的评论工作，批判了国际间的反动文艺思想，介绍了现代先进文艺理论。所有这些，都有助于在世界范围内清除反动文学的毒害，抵制修正主义文学的影响。同时，针对着我国建设社会主义文学的需要，很适时地介绍了社会主义国家（主要是苏联）文学的先进经验。给我们许多帮助。
    我们期待着今年起“译文”改名后的“世界文学”，在加强现实性和战斗性方面有更大的跃进。
