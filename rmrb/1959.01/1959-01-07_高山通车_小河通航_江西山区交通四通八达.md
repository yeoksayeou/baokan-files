Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 6th - The once-isolated mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province have now established a comprehensive transportation network. According to statistics, by the end of November last year, the mountainous areas of the province had built over 40,000 kilometers of highways, simple roads, and large flatbed cart paths, which is more than ten times the total mileage of roads built in the province during the First Five-Year Plan period. Over 1,400 kilometers of rivers were dredged and repaired, which is 1.4 times the total mileage of rivers dredged in the province during the First Five-Year Plan period. In addition, most ore production bases and water conservancy construction sites throughout the province have erected cableways and aerial ropeways. In old revolutionary base areas such as Ruijin and Yongxin counties, many earthen railways have also been built. In terms of transportation equipment, the province has newly purchased 300 automobiles, self-made more than 700 trailers and over 1,000 various boats and rafts, and has also newly manufactured a large number of folk transportation tools.

Due to the rapid development of transportation, the mountain economy has become more active. In the past, Yifeng County, with its towering mountains and ridges everywhere, relied mostly on manual labor for the import and export of goods, which affected the development of the local economy. Last year, the county built more than 200 kilometers of roads, ensuring that every township was accessible by car and every village by flatbed cart. Not only did the county save a large amount of labor to support steel production, but it also smoothly transported 120,000 cubic meters of timber and 7.75 million thatch bamboos to support industrial and agricultural production in other areas. In Damou Mountain in Dexing County, there are dozens of kinds of wild plants that can be used to brew wine. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, the masses were afraid that they could not transport the wine after brewing, and most of these wild plants were wasted. After the road to Damou Mountain was built last year, the masses established many wineries and made full use of wild plant resources.

Jiangxi Province is rich in resources, with mountainous areas accounting for more than 60% of the total area of the province. In April last year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial transportation conference, pointing out that transportation construction is an important condition for developing industrial and agricultural production. If transportation in mountainous areas is not improved, the diverse economy of mountainous areas cannot be developed. All localities should unswervingly implement the "walking on two legs" policy and vigorously develop transportation construction in mountainous areas. Under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, Party committees at all levels strengthened their leadership over transportation construction in mountainous areas, established a system of hierarchical management and division of labor with individual responsibility; emphasized relying on the masses, focusing on local resources, combining indigenous and modern methods, building both modern highways and simple roads and flatbed cart paths; purchasing automobiles, trailers, and ships on the one hand, and manufacturing earthen carts, ox carts, and flatbed carts on the other; building roads and dredging rivers to turn all dead ends into living paths and dead water into living water. As a result, the face of transportation in mountainous areas has changed rapidly.

### 高山通车　小河通航  江西山区交通四通八达

    高山通车　小河通航
    江西山区交通四通八达
    新华社南昌6日电　往昔闭塞的江西山区，现在已经建设起四通八达的交通网。据统计，到去年11月底，全省山区共兴建公路、简易公路和大板车道四万多公里，等于第一个五年计划期间全省所修公路里程总和的十倍多；整修河流一千四百多公里，等于第一个五年计划期间全省整疏河道里程总和的一点四倍。此外，全省大部分矿石生产基地、水利工地，都架设了滑道和空中索道；老根据地瑞金、永新等县，还兴建了不少土铁路。在交通工具方面，全省新购汽车三百辆，自制挂车七百多辆和各种船筏一千多只，同时还新制了大批的民间运输工具。
    由于交通运输事业的迅速发展，山区经济进一步活跃起来。原来到处是崇山峻岭的宜丰县，全县调入调出的物资，绝大部分都靠肩挑背驮影响了地方经济的发展。去年这个县修了二百多公里公路，做到乡乡通汽车、村村通板车，全县不但节约了大批劳动力支援了钢铁生产，还顺利地运出了十二万立方公尺的木材和七百七十五万根茅竹，支援外地工农业生产。德兴县的大茅山能酿酒的野生植物有几十种，过去由于交通不便，群众怕酿了酒运不出去，这些野生植物大部分被浪费掉了。去年通向大茅山的公路修成以后，群众就大办酿酒厂，充分利用了野生植物资源。
    江西省山区物资丰富，占全省总面积60％以上。去年4月，中共江西省委召开全省交通会议，指出交通建设是发展工农业生产的重要条件，山区交通搞不好，山区的多种经济就无法开展。各地应坚定不移地执行“两条腿走路”的方针，大力发展山区交通建设。各级党委在省委号召下，都加强了对山区交通建设的领导，建立了分级管理、分工负责制；强调依靠群众，以土为主，土洋结合，既修现代化的公路，也修简易公路和大板车道；一方面购买汽车、挂车、轮船，一方面制造土车、牛车和大板车；既修建道路，也疏通河流，把所有的死路变成活路，死水变成活水。从而使山区交通运输事业的面貌迅速改观。
