Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: According to TASS, Detroit, January 9th: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan and his party arrived in Detroit from Cleveland on the morning of January 8th. Walker Cisler, manager of Detroit Edison Company, greeted Mikoyan at the airport.

Mikoyan made a statement to reporters, emphasizing, "I have a hope: that there will never be a war between our two peoples. Let all the people of all countries live in a peaceful environment."

Mikoyan spent almost the entire day in Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, visiting factories and laboratories. After getting off the plane, he went straight to the Ford Motor Company's Scientific Research Center and then visited the engine and assembly shops of Ford's largest "River Rouge Plant." Workers on the assembly line welcomed Mikoyan, and some workers left the conveyor belt to shake hands with him.

In the engine shop, Mikoyan talked to the workers about the cause of maintaining peace. The workers replied, "(American) workers oppose war."

After the visit, Mikoyan told reporters, "Good factory, good workers, I wish them success."

In the afternoon, Henry Ford II hosted a banquet for Mikoyan in the company's main building, attended by celebrities from the American automobile industry and the Detroit business community.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: According to TASS, Chicago, January 10th: Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan arrived in Chicago from Detroit on January 9th. After arriving at the "Hilton" Hotel, he immediately held a press conference and answered many questions from reporters.

Asked what he had gained from his talks in the United States, Mikoyan replied: "I feel that some prejudices have been completely eliminated or are no longer as serious. I am concerned that the Cold War has overly poisoned the atmosphere. However, I believe that your people, especially business people, have expressed their willingness to improve relations with us. As for the people, I don't need to say more. The people of your country and the people of our country do not want war." Mikoyan continued, of course, the Cold War is still playing a role, but people are increasingly convinced that the Cold War must be ended. As long as the Cold War continues, the danger of the Cold War turning into a hot war will always exist. Mikoyan emphasized that a new war would cause countless sacrifices and terrible consequences. Mikoyan said, "To avoid these disasters, the Cold War must be ended and mutual understanding must be reached."

A reporter asked whether the different interpretations of the concept of "peace" between the United States and the Soviet Union would hinder mutual understanding. Mikoyan said: "The concept of 'peace' should not allow for two different interpretations. Some people here are focusing on who should be responsible for the Cold War, trying to shift the responsibility onto us. This is an incorrect approach. If this is done, the debate on this issue will never end. It is best to leave this question to future historians to solve, and we should best seek ways to improve relations between our two countries."

Someone asked whether it could be said that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union had improved. Mikoyan replied: "I think that if we consider public opinion, there have at least been signs of improvement recently."

In answering reporters' questions about the upcoming 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikoyan emphasized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is now unprecedentedly united. He said that the congress will discuss the Soviet Union's seven-year development plan, which is a magnificent program for further peaceful construction and is unanimously supported by all Soviet people.

In the afternoon, the Chicago Commercial Club held a banquet for Mikoyan. Among those attending the banquet were Democratic Party leader Stevenson, former Inland Steel Company Chairman Ryerson, Chicago Chamber of Commerce President Coulter, as well as well-known figures from Illinois industry and finance, publishers of Chicago newspapers, and well-known figures from all walks of life.

In his speech at the banquet, Mikoyan emphasized that business people can play a huge role in improving Soviet-American relations. He also mentioned the Allied relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States during World War II. Mikoyan said that it would be ideal if such a close relationship existed now. He said, however, that this could not be achieved all at once.

Mikoyan talked about American prejudices against the Soviet Union. Mikoyan said that there was once a saying that the Soviet Union wanted to attack the United States and destroy the United States. Now some people are talking about the economic "threat" from the Soviet Union, insisting that the Soviet Union wants to use economic means to destroy the United States. But you know, we have other more important things and tasks. We want to make our people live more affluent lives, and we want to achieve this through our own labor. What threat is there in that?

Some people also say that we are communists and that we want to carry out "subversive activities" in other countries. We are indeed communists and sympathize with communists in other countries. But we know very well that communism is not an import or an export. It is a natural result of internal development in a country. Mikoyan pointed out how huge the disasters a new war could bring to mankind. He said that if the United States is aware of this danger, then it should practice peaceful coexistence. Despite our different systems, let us live in peace.

Mikoyan continued, "We are not talking about these things because we are weak. We have everything necessary for defense. We are talking about these things because we are concerned about maintaining peace. We never start wars. Even if we were many times stronger than the United States, we would not do such a thing."

    米高扬在底特律和芝加哥谈话
    苏联致力建设繁荣富裕社会
    希望各国人民永享和平安乐
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社底特律9日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬及其随行人员于1月8日早晨从克利夫兰到达底特律。到机场欢迎米高扬的有底特律爱迪生公司经理沃克·西斯勒。
    米高扬向记者发表了谈话。他在谈话中强调说，我有一个希望：让我们两国人民之间永远不会有战争。让各国人民都生活在和平的环境里。
    米高扬在底特律这个美国汽车工业中心度过的一天几乎完全花在参观工厂和实验室上面。他下飞机后，就一直前往福特汽车公司的科学研究中心参观，然后又参观了福特公司最大的“里维尔·劳基工厂”的发动机车间和装配车间。正在流水作业线上工作的工人们对米高扬表示欢迎，有些工人离开传送带跑上前去同他握手。
    在发动机车间，米高扬同工人们谈起了维护和平事业的问题。工人们回答说：“（美国的）工人反对战争”。
    米高扬在参观结束后对记者说，好的工厂，好的工人，我祝他们成功。
    下午，亨利·福特第二在公司的主楼设宴招待米高扬，出席宴会的有美国汽车工业以及底特律工商界的名流。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社芝加哥10日讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬9日从底特律到达芝加哥。他在到达“希尔顿”饭店以后立即举行了记者招待会，回答了记者的许多问题。
    记者问，他在美国进行的交谈中有什么收获，米高扬回答说：“我觉得，某些偏见已经完全消除或者不再是那么严重了。我担心冷战过于毒化了气氛。不过我相信，你们的人、特别是工商界人士表示愿意同我们改善关系。至于人民，我就更不用谈了。贵国人民和我国人民都不要战争”。米高扬接着说，当然，冷战仍然在起着作用，但是人们越来越相信必需结束冷战。只要冷战还在继续，那么冷战变成热战的危险就永远存在。米高扬强调指出，新的战争将会造成不可胜数的牺牲，造成可怕的后果。米高扬说：“为了避免这些灾难，必须结束冷战和达成互相谅解”。
    有一个记者问，美国和苏联对“和平”这个概念的解释有分歧，是否会妨碍互相谅解。米高扬说：“‘和平’的概念不容许有两种不同的解释。你们这里有些人集中注意力于：冷战应当由谁来负责，企图把责任推到我们身上。这是一个不正确的办法。如果这样做的话，这个问题的争论就会永无休止。最好是把这个问题留给未来的历史学家去解决，我们最好是谋求改善我们两国关系的道路。”
    有人问，是否可以说美国同苏联的关系已经得到了改善。米高扬回答说：“我觉得，如果考虑到舆论，最近至少有了改善的迹象。”
    在回答记者有关苏联共产党即将举行的第二十一次代表大会的问题时，米高扬强调指出，苏联共产党现在空前团结。他说，这次代表大会将讨论苏联的七年发展计划，这个计划是进一步进行和平建设的宏伟纲领，它得到全体苏联人民的一致拥护。
    下午，在芝加哥实业界俱乐部为米高扬举行了宴会。出席宴会的有民主党领袖史蒂文森、前内陆钢铁公司董事长赖尔逊、芝加哥工商协会会长寇耳特以及伊利诺斯州工业界和金融界著名人士、芝加哥各报的发行人和各界著名人士。
    米高扬在宴会上的讲话中强调指出，实业界人士在改善苏美关系方面能够起巨大作用。他还提到在第二次世界大战期间苏美的盟国关系。米高扬说，如果现在也存在这种密切的关系，那就理想了。他说，但是一下子是不可能达到这个目的的。
  米高扬谈到了美国对苏联的偏见。米高扬说，一度曾流传这样一种说法：苏联想进攻美国并消灭美国。现在又有人在谈论什么来自苏联的经济“威胁”，硬说苏联想用经济手段消灭美国。但是你们知道，我们有别的更重要的事情和任务。我们要使我国人民生活得更富裕，我们要用自己的劳动达到这个目的。这有什么威胁呢？
    还有人说，我们是共产党人，我们想在其他国家进行“颠覆工作”。我们的确是共产党人，并且同情其他国家的共产党人。但是我们非常清楚地知道，共产主义不是输入品或者输出品。这是一个国家内部发展的自然结果。米高扬指出：新战争可能给人类带来多么巨大的灾难。他说，如果美国意识到这种危险，那么就应当实行和平共处。尽管我们的制度不同，让我们和平相处吧。
    米高扬接着说，我们谈到这些，并不是因为我们软弱。我们有防御所必需的一切。我们谈到这些，是因为我们关心维护和平。我们从来不发动战争。即使我们比美国强多少倍，我们也不会干这种事。
