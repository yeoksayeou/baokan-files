    Consolidating Small Factories into Larger Ones
    Yongdeng, Gansu, Rectifies Existing Factories and Mines
    (Our newspaper’s dispatch from Lanzhou, January 5th) Yongdeng County, Gansu Province, has begun to rectify its existing factories and mines, consolidating small factories into larger ones in order to better unleash the potential of these enterprises and meet the needs of production, construction, and exports.
    During last year's drive to develop local industries, various factories and mines sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, with the total number of such enterprises in the county reaching over five thousand. These factories and mines played a significant role in supporting agricultural production, invigorating the local economy, and increasing people's incomes. However, due to excessive decentralization and a degree of blindness in establishing factories in some areas, numerous problems arose in terms of political ideology, production management, raw material supply, and sales. As a result, some factories drifted aimlessly, failing to meet their production targets effectively, and the quality of their products could not be improved rapidly. After studying this situation in November, the Yongdeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concluded that if this trend continued, it would not only be difficult to guarantee the needs of a greater leap forward in 1959 but could also affect the consolidation of existing factories and mines. The County Committee decided to merge most of the small factories that could be combined into larger factories, reducing the number of factories and mines while increasing the variety and value of products. The goal is to establish seven types of industries throughout the county, including metallurgy, machinery, electricity, building materials, chemicals, and mining and processing. The County Committee also stipulated that the large factories formed by merging small factories should be comprehensive, breaking away from the practice of only merging factories of the same nature. The County Committee determined that in 1959, the county level would establish eleven comprehensive factories. Each commune must establish larger factories for machinery, garment processing, building materials, fertilizer, and calcium powder processing. Additionally, a batch of factories would be established on a large scale based on specific circumstances. The county-run factory in Heqiyi would focus on steel production while also engaging in the production of cement, bricks, tiles, and calcium powder processing. Other factories would focus on the production of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and pesticides, while some would focus on coal mining and coal oil refining.
    Through comparative research, the Yongdeng County Committee believes that running joint factories has the following benefits: First, it can save cadres and further strengthen the leadership of factories and mines; second, it can better unleash the potential of the labor force and improve equipment utilization rates; third, it can reduce many unnecessary investments; fourth, contradictions in production and sales and raw material supply issues can be further resolved; fifth, multiple production lines within a single factory can cultivate multi-skilled workers; and sixth, it can overcome a significant portion of the difficulties caused by a lack of technical expertise.
    Currently, the county-run eleven comprehensive factories have begun planning and organization. The comprehensive machinery, smelting, and processing factory run by Chengguan has been basically established.

    把小厂联成规模较大的厂
    甘肃永登整顿现有厂矿
    本报兰州5日电　甘肃省永登县着手整顿现有厂矿，把小厂联成规模较大的工厂，以便更好地发挥厂矿的潜力，供应生产建设和出口的需要。
    在去年大办地方工业运动中，全县地方工业如雨后春笋，各种厂矿曾发展到五千多个。这些厂矿对支援农业生产、活跃地方经济、增加人民收入等起了重大作用。但是由于过于零散，部分地区建厂还带有一些盲目性，以致在政治思想、生产管理、原材料供应以及产销等方面出现了不少问题。因此，有些厂子陷于自流，产值计划完成得不好，产品质量不能迅速提高。中共永登县委在11月间研究了这种情况后，认为这种情况如果继续下去，不但难以保证1959年更大跃进的需要，还可能影响原有厂矿的巩固。县委确定将大部分可以联合起来的小厂子联合成大厂，减少厂矿数目，增加产品品种和产值，在全县建立冶金、机械、电力、建筑材料、化学、采矿加工等七种工业。县委还确定，小厂联成的大厂都要成为综合性的，要打破单一、即性质相同才联合的作法。县委确定，在1959年县一级将办十一个综合厂，各公社必须办机械、服装加工、建筑材料、化肥及钙粉加工等较大的厂，另外还要根据具体情况再大办一批工厂。河棨驿的县办工厂以钢铁为主，再搞些水泥、砖瓦、钙粉加工等生产。其他工厂有的以生产化肥、菌肥、农药为主，有的以采煤和煤炼油等为主。
    经过对比研究，永登县委认为，办联合工厂有以下好处：一、可以节省干部，并能进一步加强厂矿的领导力量；二、能够更好地发挥劳动力的潜力，提高设备利用率；三、可以减少许多不必要的投资；四、产销矛盾及原材料供应问题可以进一步得到解决；五、一厂多种生产，可以培养多面手；六、能够克服很大部分技术力量不足的困难。
    目前，县办的十一个综合厂已经开始筹划组织；城关办的机械、冶炼和加工综合厂已经基本组成。
