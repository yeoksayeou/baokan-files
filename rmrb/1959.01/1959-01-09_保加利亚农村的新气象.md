New Atmosphere in Bulgarian Rural Areas
By our correspondents Li Cheng and Qu Jitao

These days, people here are always excitedly talking about the great leap forward in Bulgarian rural areas when they meet. Recently, with excitement and enthusiasm, our correspondents visited rural areas in northern Bulgaria and have written down what we saw and heard below.

Small Co-ops Merge into Large Co-ops

Encouraged by the slogan of "completing the agricultural tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in three years," Bulgarian rural areas have launched a mass movement to build water conservancy projects and reclaim wasteland for fertilizer accumulation. During the movement, farmers proposed to increase the originally planned 200,000 hectares of irrigated land to 500,000 hectares and to turn wasteland into orchards. Since these plans could not be accomplished by small cooperatives, the farmers themselves proposed the merging of small co-ops into large co-ops.

At present, this movement has come to a victorious end. The past 3,450 small co-ops have been merged into 640 large co-ops, with each co-op possessing an average of 70,000 to 80,000 decares of cultivated land. This is a significant step towards communism in Bulgarian rural areas.

After the merger, many state and county Party and government leaders who originally grew up in the countryside returned to their villages and were elected as chairmen of agricultural cooperatives. For example, as of December 12, among the 65 co-ops in the Pleven region after the merger, 31 co-op chairmen were originally secretaries of the state and county Party committees, deputy chairmen of the People's Congress, and other leaders. This is of great significance for consolidating and giving full play to the advantages of large co-ops. When the co-op members talked to us about this, they were all beaming with joy. They said, "With a good chairman, we can be even more assured..."

Large-Scale Water Conservancy

A biting cold is attacking the earth, the soil has begun to freeze, and a thin layer of ice has formed on the river surface. In previous years, this was the slack season for farming, and farmers rarely went to work, but now, in the national movement to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, groups of male and female co-op members can be seen working in the fields everywhere - building reservoirs, digging canals, constructing dams, planting corn, and spreading manure. When we visited Nova Szeni village in the Pleven region, we saw co-op members using pickaxes and shovels to dig soil, and then loading the soil onto horse-drawn carts or oxcarts to transport it to where it was needed.

The chairman of the agricultural cooperative and the secretary of the Party organization told us, "Originally, there would have been machines to dig the soil, but the co-op members were unwilling to wait for the machines. They said that every shovel of soil dug is one more drop of water gained, and we cannot miss the opportunity."

Bulgaria has many rivers, but apart from twelve larger rivers, they are all very small, and they dry up in the summer. Therefore, the only effective way to increase the area of irrigated land in Bulgaria is to store water in winter and spring. "Racing against time for water" is the resounding slogan of the co-op members in building water conservancy projects.

According to our understanding, in order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, Bulgaria plans to complete water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, canals, and dams that can irrigate 1.5 million decares of land this past winter and coming spring. This task is mainly completed by the agricultural cooperatives using their own funds and the labor of the co-op members. 1.5 million decares is an amazing leap forward! It is equivalent to three times the area of irrigated land in Bulgaria before liberation, and equivalent to more than one-third of the water conservancy projects built in the fourteen years since liberation!

Giving play to the initiative of local areas and the masses is the basic guarantee for completing this amazing leap forward. Gelganov, the Minister of Agriculture of the Pleven State Party Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and Golov, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau of the People's Congress of this state, told us such a story: In the past, the water conservancy plan formulated by the central government for the Pleven state planned to build a large reservoir that could irrigate 2.5 million decares of cultivated land and a hydroelectric power station, but this project would not start construction until 1963 and would not be completed until 31 years later. Now, with the agricultural co-ops being larger, the water conservancy projects built this past winter and coming spring using the co-op's funds and the labor of the co-op members will irrigate 250,000 decares, almost equivalent to the water conservancy projects built in the past fourteen years. Some water conservancy experts we met in Bulgarian rural areas all exclaimed, "The power of the masses is really great!"

Cadres Organize Production Teams

Last November, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party called on Party and state cadres at all levels to take some time each year to participate in physical labor. This call was warmly supported by the vast number of cadres, who actively participated in planting trees, building canals, and terracing fields. Some cadres in some places even bought tools such as shovels, planning to regularly participate in physical labor.

The news that village and co-op cadres in some rural areas of Nikopol County, Kolarovgrad Province, had formed production teams to farm independently attracted special attention. On December 20, we visited Sadina village in this county. Stoyanov, the chairman of the village People's Congress and the leader of the village co-op cadres' production team, gave us a detailed introduction to the situation of their production team.

The production team is composed of more than 80 people, including all the staff of the village People's Congress and the agricultural co-op, doctors and nurses at the village hospital, and teaching staff at the primary school, who take turns to perform voluntary labor in the fields. The agricultural co-op has allocated 100 decares of cultivated land to the cadres' production team. Now the land of the cadres' production team has been planted with corn, sunflowers, and beets. The cadres' production team has adopted various measures such as deep plowing, applying more fertilizer, and watering more to ensure that the average yield of the production team's cultivated land is higher than the average yield of the agricultural co-op. Stoyanov explained to us that their purpose in doing so was threefold: First, to enrich production knowledge and experience and better lead production; second, to further strengthen the relationship between cadres and co-op members; and third, to contribute to completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Last November, the slogan "Five-Year Plan - Complete in Three to Four Years" put forward by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party has become the action program of the broad masses of the Bulgarian people. In the countryside, the goal of the vast number of cooperative members is to increase agricultural production in 1960 by two times compared to 1958! Our observations in the countryside prove that this glorious and arduous task will surely be completed and overfulfilled. (Attached picture)

    保加利亚农村的新气象
    本报记者　李成　曲季涛
    这些日子，我们这里的人们见了面总要兴高采烈地谈论保加利亚农村的大跃进。最近，记者怀着激动与兴奋的心情访问了保加利亚北部的农村，并在下面写出我们的所见所闻。
    小社并大社
    保加利亚农村在“三年完成五年计划规定的农业任务”的口号的鼓舞下，展开了兴修水利、开荒积肥的群众运动。运动中农民们提出要把原计划规定的增加二十万公顷水浇地提高到五十万公顷，要把荒地变成果园。由于实现这些计划不是小型的合作社所能办到的，因此农民自己提出了并大社的要求。
    目前，这一运动已胜利结束，过去的三千四百五十个小社，已并成六百四十个大社，每社平均拥有七万到八万狄卡尔耕地。这是保加利亚农村向共产主义迈进的具有重大意义的一步。
    并社后，有很多过去生长在农村的州、县党政负责人回到本村，当选为农业社主席。例如，到12月12日为止，普勒文州并社后的六十五个社中，就有三十一个社的主席原来是州、县党委书记、人民会议副主席等负责人。这对巩固和充分发挥大社的优越性有着重要意义。社员们同我们谈起这事来，都喜得眉笑颜开，他们说：“有个好主席，就更放心了……”。
    大兴水利
    峭寒袭击着大地，泥土开始封冻，河面已结了薄冰。往年这时候，已是农闲时节，农民很少出工，但是现在，在提前完成五年计划全民运动中，到处可以看到成群结队的男女社员在田野上劳动——修水库、修渠道、筑水坝、种玉米、撒粪肥。我们在普勒文州诺瓦斯泽尼村访问时，看到社员们用十字镐和铁锹挖土，然后把土装上马车或牛车运到需要的地方。
    农业社主席和党组织书记告诉我们说：“本来，就会有机器来掘土的，但是社员们不愿坐等机器，他们说，多挖一锹土就多得一滴水，不能错过时机。”
    保加利亚有很多河流，但除了十二条较大河流外，都是很小的河，到了夏季就干涸了。所以，在保加利亚增加水浇地面积的唯一有效办法，是在冬春把水储起来。“与时间争水”，这是社员们兴修水利的响亮口号。
    据我们了解，为了保证农业丰收，去冬今春，保加利亚全国要完成可以浇地一百五十万狄卡尔的水库、水渠、坝等水利工程，主要由农业社用自己的资金和社员的劳动完成这一任务。一百五十万狄卡尔，这是一个惊人的跃进！它相当于保加利亚解放前水浇地面积的三倍，相当于解放后十四年来兴修的水利工程的三分之一以上！
    发挥地方和群众积极性是完成这一惊人跃进的基本保证。保共普勒文州党委农业部长盖尔加诺夫和这个州的人民会议水利局长高洛夫给我们讲了这样一个故事：过去，中央制定的普勒文州水利规划，预计要修一个可浇地二百五十万狄卡尔耕地的大水库，一个水电站，但这一工程要在1963年才能动工兴建，过三十一年才能完工。现在，农业社大了，仅仅去冬今春用社里的资金和社员的劳动修的水利工程，就将浇地二十五万狄卡尔，几乎相当于过去十四年兴修的水利工程。我们在保加利亚农村碰到的一些水利专家都赞叹地说：“群众力量实在伟大！”
    干部组织生产队
    去年11月保加利亚共产党中央全会号召各级党和国家干部每年要抽出一定时间参加体力劳动。这一号召得到广大干部的热烈拥护，他们纷纷参加植树、修筑水渠和梯田。有的地方的干部自己还买了铁锹等工具，作经常参加体力劳动的打算。
    科拉罗夫格勒州尼科波尔县一些农村的村社干部组成生产队单独种田的消息，引起了人们的特别注意。12月20日，我们访问了这个县的萨迪那村。村人民会议主席、村社干部生产队长斯多伊阿诺夫详细地给我们介绍了他们生产队的一些情况。
    生产队由八十多人组成，包括村人民会议和农业社的全体工作人员，村医院的医生和护士，小学的教职员等不直接参加生产的人员轮流到田间进行义务劳动。农业社划出了一百狄卡尔耕地给干部生产队。现在干部生产队的地已种上了玉米、向日葵和甜菜。干部生产队采取了深耕、多施肥、多浇水等各种措施保证生产队耕地的平均产量高于农业社的平均产量。斯多伊阿诺夫给我们解释说，他们这样作的目的有三：一、丰富生产知识和经验，更好地领导生产；二、更加密切干部同社员关系；三、为提前完成五年计划贡献一分力量。
    去年11月，保共中央全会提出的“五年计划——三四年完成”的号召已成为保加利亚广大群众的行动纲领。在农村中，广大的合作社社员的奋斗目标，是在1960年时使农业生产比1958年增长两倍！我们在农村的见闻证明，这一光荣而艰巨的任务一定能完成和超额完成。（附图片）
