Let Water Serve Production
    — An Introduction to the Water Conservancy Room of the Increased Production Measures Hall at the National Agricultural Exhibition
    By our reporter Lu Xiangtao

    In our agricultural country, the ancient land has suddenly become young today. With unprecedented vitality, it has nourished us with exceptionally abundant crops, causing agricultural production to increase miraculously and rapidly. If one asks where this miracle comes from, please visit the Water Conservancy Room of the National Agricultural Exhibition first.

    An Unprecedented Miracle

    Stepping into the Water Conservancy Room of the Increased Production Measures Hall, our hearts immediately overflow with irrepressible passion! Facing us is a large relief sculpture: a group of boiling people fighting on the water conservancy construction site; in front of the background of the blue sky, stands a statue of a heroic farmer stretching out his steel arms to move mountains and seas. He shows the heroic spirit of 600 million people ordering "mountains to bow their heads, and rivers to give way."

    On a huge display board, rocket-like red numerical indicators show that last year alone, the country expanded its irrigated area by 480 million mu, exceeding the total irrigated area opened up in thousands of years of history and the eight years after liberation, bringing the current irrigated area in our country to 1 billion mu, accounting for more than half of the country's cultivated land area, and more than one-third of the world's irrigated area. This is an unprecedented miracle in Chinese and foreign history! According to statistics, the world has expanded its irrigated area by more than 400 million mu in the past 20 years, but our achievements in one year have surpassed it. The heroic people have written a glorious page in the history of world water conservancy.

    "We have already raised high the red banner of 'Man can conquer nature,' and we have already sung loudly the triumphant song of conquering nature!" The guide told us: "In 1958, our country was not blessed with good weather. Judging from the drought situation alone, the cumulative drought-affected area in the country in 1958 was 470 million mu; however, thanks to the large number of water conservancy projects built in various places this year, which have played a role in irrigation and water storage, water and drought disasters have been basically avoided, enabling the country to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest of doubled and redoubled grain and cotton production, and abundant harvests of all crops." Today, the material conditions that determine the "fate" of agricultural production have changed!

    On a colorful light map arranged like a sky full of stars, people can see the great achievements in the comprehensive management of major rivers and rivers. In the all-round Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction, about 100 large and medium-sized rivers have completed basin planning; on several major rivers, we have built 18 large reservoirs and water conservancy hub projects, and 12 large sluice gates; we have newly built and renovated 100,000 kilometers of dikes... These projects have played a huge role in reducing water and drought disasters and developing agricultural production. For thousands of years, people have been afraid of water, fearing that it would destroy their farmland and homes. Now, people see on the Sanmenxia Project across the Yellow River and the irrigation schematic diagram of the Yellow River Basin that the river water has flowed according to people's will.

    The Victory of the "Three Main" Policy

    Countless facts tell people: Believing in the Party and Chairman Mao is believing in the truth.

    Only two years ago, the people of Henan were still worried about the threat of water and drought disasters and still had food problems. However, in the water conservancy upsurge, the people of the province conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of "focusing on storage, small-scale projects, and community management" in water conservancy construction, and after eight months of hard work, they achieved water conservancy in one fell swoop and became a surplus grain province. From the magnificent scenes of taming the Mang River and comprehensively utilizing the Shaying River in the Water Conservancy Room, we saw the communist spirit of the people of Henan in conquering nature!

    On the electric model of the Dongliang Canal, people saw the clear Nie River water, following the guide's pointer, pass through the Sacred Mother Forest, Changchong Mountain, and cross Yanwang Bian and Guimen Pass... obediently climbed up Dongliang Mountain. The Nie River water irrigates more than 30,000 mu of fertile land along the coast, washes away the thousand-year drought and poverty of Dongliang Mountain, opens up people's minds, and produces thousands of large and small canals leading water up the mountain in Wushan County, as well as the Gansu mountain canal—the earth-shattering Yintao Project. The Dongliang Canal has opened up a road for water conservancy in mountainous areas and pointed out the direction.

    In September last year, when Chairman Mao inspected Anhui, he carefully looked at the planning map of the Huaibei River Network Project. Now this latest and most beautiful picture has been brought to Beijing for exhibition according to the wishes of the respected leader. The people of Anhui want to use their own strength to excavate more than 310,000 artificial rivers and canals of various sizes with a total length of 86,000 kilometers on the vast plain of 38,000 square kilometers, so that all the farmland in Qianli Huaibei will be turned into paddy fields and irrigated land, becoming a fertile land of fish and rice free from drought and flood. Not long ago, I visited Huaibei. Some places here are already crisscrossed with rivers and canals, with ponds and weirs dotted everywhere, trees lined up in rows, and rice paddies covering the fields! The numbers on the display board show that last year, due to the realization of river network in many areas, Huaibei overcame major droughts and floods, and the area of rice cultivation increased to 5.3 million mu, with an average yield of 640 jin per mu. The hat of the disaster area in Huaibei has been removed, and the days of half a year of chaff and vegetables for 12 million people will never return! The brave and wise people tour the Water Conservancy Room. From the large number of photos on display, we can see many heroic figures on the water conservancy front who dare to think, dare to act, and have original spirit. Look at these photos, the simple farmer who is measuring the canal leading water up the mountain with his own "bamboo tube level," he is Comrade Li Dahui, a farmer water conservancy expert from Jun County, Hubei; look, that group of young girls who are tamping the dam of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, each of them is covered with sweat, they are the famous "Jiulan" group; look, how energetic are the three children who are drilling holes on the cliff! This is the "Young Pioneer Class" on the Zhangbei Canal construction site in She County, Hebei. They fought hard for three months like adult migrant workers without being absent, until the Zhanghe River water was brought to the Taihang Mountains.

    When people see the glorious image of the leaders building water conservancy with us, and the scene of the first secretaries of the Party committees of various provinces and regions participating in water conservancy construction, they cannot suppress the excitement in their hearts for a long time.

    Our Party is our guiding light. The leadership of the Party and the mass line are the decisive factors for the victory of all our undertakings.

    With the Party supporting us,
    We can cut off rivers and move mountains;
    If we use our energy,
    We can change the earth.

    This romantic folk song from Jilin, written on the wall of the Water Conservancy Room, accurately praises the leading role of our Party in water conservancy construction. In a corner of the Water Conservancy Room, there is a model of a wooden arch aqueduct spanning the Yellow River, which is a flower created by the working people breaking superstitions, daring to think, and daring to act. This wooden aqueduct is the key project of the Red Flag Fluttering Hero Canal in Yongjing County, Gansu, which brings the rolling Yellow River water to the dry loess plateau 35 kilometers away, irrigating more than 33,000 mu of land.

    Beautiful Illusions to be Realized

    When visiting the last part of the Water Conservancy Room—the Prospect of National Water Conservancy and Electrification—people will feel happy. The exhibits here tell people that in the vast land of our country, there will be a beautiful scene of "rivers and canals crisscrossing, fields as neatly arranged as chess grids, river network, landscaping, agricultural production industrialization, villages with flowing water for boats, and communities with hydropower generation" in a few years. At that time, whether in cities or villages, electricity will become the most common power source in people's lives and production. The scene of "no need for cattle to cultivate the land, and no need for oil to light the lamps" that farmers have dreamed of for many years will also be realized in all rural areas of the country.

    On the leap forward platform in the Water Conservancy Room, came the good news of the "Huaihai Battle" on the water conservancy front in 1959: Since the beginning of winter, various places have completed 4.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork and stonework, added 22.2 million mu of irrigated area, and controlled 49,000 square kilometers of soil erosion... At present, 36.3 million autumn harvest troops across the country have successively turned to the water conservancy front, and a greater leap forward winter repair upsurge has arrived!

    让水为生产服务
    ——全国农业展览会增产措施馆水利室介绍
    本报记者　卢向韬
    在我们这个农业国度里，古老的土地今天忽然变得年青起来了，它以从未显示过的充沛的活力为我们哺养了空前丰盛的庄稼，使农产品的产量神话般地飞快地增长起来了。人们若问这个奇迹从何而来？就请先到全国农业展览会水利室参观吧。
    亘古未有的奇迹
    跨进增产措施馆水利室，我们内心立刻涌溢着难以遏止的激情！迎面是一幅大浮雕：一群沸腾了的人们，战斗在水利建设工地上；在蓝湛湛的天空背景的前面，耸立着一个伸开钢铁臂膀移山造海的英雄农民的塑像。他显示了六亿人民命令“高山低头，河水让路”的豪迈气概。
    在一块巨幅图板上，那火箭似的红色数字指标表明：去年一年全国扩大了四亿八千万亩的灌溉面积，超过历史上几千年和解放后八年开辟灌溉面积的总和，使目前我国灌溉面积跃升到十亿亩，占全国耕地面积一半以上，占世界灌溉面积的三分之一以上。这是翻遍中外历史亘古未有的奇迹！据统计，最近二十年间全世界扩大灌溉面积共有四亿多亩，可是我们一年的成就就把它超过了。英雄的人民在世界水利史上写下了光辉的一页。
    “我们已经高高举起人定胜天的红旗，已经放声歌唱征服自然的凯歌！”讲解员告诉我们说：“1958年我国并不是风调雨顺的。仅仅就干旱情况来看，1958年全国累计受旱面积四亿七千万亩；但是，由于今年各地所修的大量水利工程，发挥了灌溉蓄水作用，水旱灾害基本上避免了，使全国取得粮棉增产加番、五谷丰登的空前大丰收。”今天，决定农业生产“命运”的物质条件改变了！
    在一幅布置得像满天星斗一样的彩色灯光图上，人们可以看到综合治理大江大河的巨大成就。在水利建设全面大跃进中，约有一百条大中河流完成了流域规划；在几条主要的江河上，我们已经建成大型水库和水利枢纽工程十八座，大型水闸十二座；新修和整修堤防达十万公里……。这些工程对减轻水旱灾害和发展农业生产起了巨大作用。几千年来，人们对于水都存有恐惧心理，唯恐它毁坏自己农田和家园。现在人们在腰斩黄河的三门峡工程和黄河流域灌溉示意图上看到，河水已经按照人的意旨流动了。
    “三主”方针的胜利
    无数的事实告诉人们：相信党和毛主席就是相信真理。
    仅仅在二年以前，河南人民还忧虑着水旱灾害的威胁，还存在着粮食问题。可是全省人民在水利高潮中，认真执行党在水利建设上提出的“以蓄为主、小型为主、社办为主”的方针，经过八个月的奋战，一举实现水利化，一跃成为余粮省。我们从水利室的驯服漭河和综合利用沙颍河的壮丽图景中，看到了河南人民战胜大自然的共产主义气魄！
    在东梁渠电动模型上，人们看到碧清的聂河水，随着讲解员的讲解棒的指点，穿过了圣母林、长虫山，跨过阎王扁、鬼门关……服服贴贴地爬上了东梁山。聂河水灌溉着沿岸三万多亩良田，冲走了东梁山的千年干旱和贫困，冲开了人们的思想，出现了武山县大大小小千百条引水上山渠道，也出现了甘肃的高山运河——惊天动地的引洮工程。东梁渠给山区水利开辟了道路，指出了方向。
    去年9月间，毛主席在安徽视察时，曾经仔细地看了淮北河网化工程规划图。现在这幅最新最美的画图，按照敬爱领袖的希望拿到北京来展览了。安徽人民要用自己的力量，在三万八千平方公里的辽阔平原上，开挖总长八万六千公里的三十一万多条大小不等的人工河道，使千里淮北全部农田变成水稻田和水浇地，成为旱涝无忧的富饶的鱼米之乡。不久以前，我访问过淮北，这里有些地方已经是河渠纵横、塘堰棋布、树木成行、稻禾遍野了！图板的数字表明，去年淮北由于许多地区实现了河网化，战胜了大旱大涝，改种水稻面积跃增到五百三十万亩，单位产量平均达到六百四十斤。淮北灾区的帽子摘掉了，一千二百万人民糠菜半年粮的日子一去永不复返了！大勇大智的人们巡回在水利室里，从展出的大量照片上，我们可以看到许多水利战线上的敢想敢干具有独创精神的英雄人物。你看这些照片，正用自己制造的“竹筒水平仪”测量引水上山渠道的那位淳朴农民，他是湖北均县的农民水利专家李大贵同志；你看，在十三陵水库大坝上打夯的那群年青姑娘，个个汗流满颊，她们是扬名中外的“九兰”组；你看，那万丈悬崖上打炮眼的三个孩子干得多有劲！这是河北涉县漳北大渠工地上的“红领巾班”。他们和成年民工一样苦战三个月，从不缺勤，直到把漳河水引上太行山。
    当人们看到领袖们和我们一起兴修水利的光辉形象，和各省区党的第一书记参加水利建设的情景时，久久不能抑制住内心的激动。
    我们的党是我们的指路明灯。党的领导和群众路线是我们一切事业取得胜利的决定因素。
    有党给咱撑腰板，
    斩断河流搬倒山；
    我们干劲使出来，
    能把地球换一换。
    写在水利室壁头上的这首富有浪漫色彩的吉林的民歌，确切地歌颂了我们党在水利建设中的领导作用。在水利室的一角，有一座凌架黄河之上的木拱大渡槽模型，它是劳动人民破除迷信、敢想敢为创造出来的花朵。这座木渡槽是甘肃永靖县红旗飘飘英雄渠的关键工程，它把滚滚的黄河水引到三十五公里以外旱塬上，灌溉三万三千多亩土地。
    美丽的幻想要实现
    参观到水利室最后一部分——全国水利化电气化前景，人们都会心花怒放。这里的展览品告诉人们，若干年之后，在我国辽阔的土地上，将出现一幅“河流渠道网络纵横，大地畦田整如棋格，河网化、园林化、农业生产工厂化，村村流水行船，社社水力发电”的美景。那时，不论城市或农村，电力就成为人们生活和生产中最普遍的一种动力。农民们多少年来幻想的“耕田不用牛，点灯不用油”的图景，也将在全国所有的农村实现。
    在水利室跃进台的图板上，传来了1959年水利战线上“淮海大战”的捷报：入冬以来，各地已完成土石方四十四亿公方，新增灌溉面积二千二百万亩，控制水土流失四万九千平方公里……。目前全国已有三千六百万三秋大军陆续转到水利战线，一个更大跃进的冬修高潮来到了！
