Xinhua News Agency, January 16th Dispatch from Brussels: According to a report in today's "Belgian Free Press," small-scale disturbances occurred again on the 14th in a suburb of Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo. The report said that Africans in the N'djili district of Léopoldville attacked the local town hall. The Belgian colonial authorities arrested four people.

At the same time, it was reported that a "committee of inquiry" from the Belgian Parliament arrived in Léopoldville on the evening of the 15th. The secretariat of this committee announced that the committee will study ways to "prevent" the recurrence of similar incidents to the recent anti-colonial uprisings.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 15th: The Belgian Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published a commentary on the government's statement regarding the future of the Congo, saying: The government's statement is very ambiguous on the key issues in the Congo's independence. The statement vaguely invokes the moving word "independence," but the content of the statement deprives this word of its true meaning.

The newspaper pointed out that while Brussels engages in empty talk about granting independence to the Congo, in Léopoldville, submachine guns and armored vehicles, death, and arrests are the living reality.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 16th: The January 16th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" carried a message in the "World Telegrams" section, expressing serious concern about the recent anti-colonialist uprisings in the Belgian Congo. The telegram pointed out that the recent series of events proves that "Africa is moving," and the days of the colonialists are numbered.

The telegram pointed out that in Africa, "Western investment is huge. In the past decade, nearly six billion dollars have been invested in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly by Western Europeans. This figure is almost as much as the total investment over seventy-five years."

    新华社16日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：据“比利时自由报”今天报道，比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔郊区在14日又发生了小规模骚动。消息说，利奥波德维尔的恩格林吉里区的非洲人曾经攻击当地的市政厅。比利时殖民当局逮捕了四人。
    同时，据报道，比利时议会的一个“调查委员会”已经在15日晚间到达利奥波德维尔。这个委员会的秘书处宣布，这个委员会将研究能够“防止”最近发生的反对殖民统治的暴动同类事件再次发生的办法。
    新华社巴黎15日电　比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”就政府关于刚果前途的声明发表评论说：在刚果独立问题中的关键性问题上，政府声明措词十分暧昧。声明含糊地引用“独立”这个动人的字眼，而声明的内容却使这个字失去真正意义。
    报纸指出，在布鲁塞尔空谈给刚果独立的时候，在利奥波德维尔，手提机关枪和装甲车辆、死亡和逮捕却是活生生的现实。
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：1月16日一期“美国新闻与世界报道”在“世界电讯”栏刊载消息，对比属刚果最近爆发的反殖民主义暴动表示严重不安，电讯指出，最近一连串事件证明，“非洲动起来了”，殖民主义者的日子不好过了。
    电讯指出，在非洲“西方的投资很多。在过去十年中，有将近六十亿美元的款项投在撒哈拉以南的非洲，其中主要是西欧人投入的。这个数字几乎有着七十五年的总投资那么多。”
