To all commanders and fighters of the heroic People's Liberation Army and the Fujian Frontline Troops,

Comrades:

As the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, marking the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, convenes in the capital, all of us representatives extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to you with immense excitement and gratitude.

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the Party's general line for socialist construction, China's agricultural production achieved unprecedentedly great victories in 1958. Grain and cotton production doubled, and other aspects of rural production, construction, and cultural and educational undertakings experienced an all-round great leap forward. The attainment of these achievements is inseparable from your merits in guarding the frontiers and coasts of the motherland day and night. Every fruitful labor achievement on the agricultural front is also a brilliant victory for you in defending peace. Every victory message from the coastal defense front is a great encouragement to us, increasing our strength and confidence in overcoming difficulties and striving for a bumper harvest.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a great call to us, putting forward the magnificent goal of producing 1,050 billion catties of grain and 100 million dan of cotton in 1959; to strive to achieve an average of 2,000 to 3,000 catties of grain per person per year nationwide in a relatively short period; to further increase the proportion of oil crops, hemp, and other various industrial raw material crops in total agricultural production, and to strive to expand the production of meat, vegetables, and various non-staple foods; to gradually realize the gardenization of cultivation and the mechanization and electrification of the production process; and to carry out a full-scale revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, just as on the industrial front, and to completely change the face of the entire agricultural front. We are determined to fight under the leadership of the Party and together with the 500 million peasants across the country to achieve this magnificent program! To strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959! Our slogan is: "Leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again; bumper harvest, bumper harvest, and bumper harvest again!"

Our countryside has already realized the people's commune system. The people's commune, which combines workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrates government administration with commune management, will greatly accelerate the speed of China's socialist construction. People's communes have universally established militia organizations, and hundreds of millions of peasants have joined the militia, engaging in labor and production on the one hand and practicing military skills on the other, achieving a combination of labor and military affairs. We love peace, and we love the fruits of peaceful labor even more. With you firmly guarding the borders of the motherland, we can produce with greater peace of mind. We vow to be your strong backing and fully support you. If imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, then we will realize a people's war, making sure they can come but never return, and drowning them in the sea of people's armed forces. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are sacred and inseparable parts of our country's territory. We are determined to fight together with the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, to achieve the complete unification of the motherland, and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

    向解放军和福建前线部队致敬电英勇的人民解放军和福建前线部队全体指战员
    同志们：
    标志着1958年农业生产大跃进的全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议在首都召开的时候，我们全体代表怀着无比兴奋和感激的心情，向你们致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，1958年我国农业生产获得了空前伟大的胜利，粮食、棉花产量成倍地增长，农村其他各项生产建设和文化教育事业都出现了全面大跃进。这些成绩的获得，和你们日日夜夜守卫着祖国边疆和海防的功劳是分不开的。农业战线上的每一项丰硕的劳动成果，同时也是你们保卫和平的光辉战果。海防前线的每一个胜利消息，对我们都是极大的鼓舞，增加了我们战胜困难争取丰收的力量和信心。
    党的八届六中全会向我们发出了伟大的号召，提出了我们在1959年生产一万零五百亿斤粮食，一亿担棉花的雄伟目标；要争取在一个较短的时期内，做到每年全国平均每口人有二千斤至三千斤粮食；要更多地增加油料、麻类和其他各种工业原料作物在全部农业生产中的比重，努力扩大肉类、蔬菜和各种副食品的生产；要逐步地实现耕作园田化和生产过程的机械化、电气化；要像在工业战线上一样，在农林牧副渔五业中实行全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。我们决心在党的领导下和全国五亿农民一道，为实现这个宏伟的纲领而奋斗！为争取1959年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！我们的口号是：“跃进、跃进、再跃进，丰收、丰收、再丰收”！
    我们农村已经实现了人民公社化，工农商学兵相结合、政社合一的人民公社，它将大大加快我国社会主义建设的速度。人民公社普遍建立了民兵组织，数以亿计的农民参加了民兵，一面劳动生产，一面练兵习武，做到了劳武结合。我们热爱和平，更热爱和平劳动的果实。有你们牢固地守卫着祖国的边疆，使我们更可以放心生产。我们誓作你们的后盾，全力支援你们。帝国主义如果胆敢发动对我国的侵略战争，那时我们将实现全民皆兵，管叫它来得去不得，淹死在人民武装的大海里。台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖是我国神圣的、不可分割的领土的一部分，我们决心和全国人民一道，为解放台、澎、金、马，实现祖国的完全统一而斗争，为维护远东及世界和平而斗争。
