    How Can Commune-Run Industry Achieve "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical"?

    People's communes must implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and must vigorously develop industry. This is a policy affirmed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. However, how can people's communes achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" in developing industry? The people's communes in Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, have provided a good approach. The industries of the people's communes in this area have not only developed rapidly, but the various factories they have built also have six major advantages: less investment, faster construction, more products, comprehensive utilization of resources, convenient management, and saving labor.

    The reason why Shangrao Prefecture's approach to developing commune-run industry is good is that these practices are in line with the principles established by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party for commune-run industry, and they provide useful experience for the current development of commune-run industry.

    The development of industry by people's communes should be planned. Shangrao Prefecture's approach is in line with this principle. People often say that commune-run industry is "blooming everywhere." This refers to the mass nature and extensiveness of this small-scale industry, and it certainly does not mean that commune-run factories can be built anywhere at will. Commune-run factories should have a unified plan and a reasonable layout. Shangrao Prefecture, in accordance with the specific local conditions, has built more than 100 small "industrial clusters" around hydropower stations, which not only avoids blindness in factory construction but also provides very good conditions for the comprehensive utilization of resources and the economization of funds.

    The industrial production of people's communes must be closely integrated with agricultural production and serve agricultural production. Shangrao Prefecture has also done well in this regard. Many of the factories built there around hydropower stations are for processing the agricultural products of the commune, and pig farms are attached to the processing plants to develop pig production using the by-products of processing. As for fertilizer plants, they are of course directly serving the development of agriculture. It is certain that developing industry in such close integration with agriculture will result in greater development of agriculture.

    The industrial production of people's communes must implement the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials. Shangrao Prefecture's approach also embodies this spirit. The main agricultural product there is rice, so the resources comprehensively utilized by the factories are also mainly rice. After processing the rice, coarse bran is used to make feed, fine bran is used to extract oil, and then bran cake is used to brew wine or make malt sugar, and finally, wine lees and sugar dregs are used to raise pigs. Here, people have made the maximum use of local agricultural product resources, turning some things that were originally of low economic value into things of high economic value.

    In developing commune-run industry, Shangrao Prefecture also paid attention to the spirit of thrift and economy, using simple and crude methods and substituting local materials for foreign ones. Old materials are used to build factory buildings, or old houses are used as factory buildings; a water turbine and a small number of belts are installed in a large factory building, and they are also comprehensively utilized as much as possible. It is precisely because of this spirit of running factories diligently and thriftily that the average investment in building a factory is at most 800 yuan.

    The policies and principles for developing industrial production in people's communes have been determined. The question now is how to correctly implement these policies and principles based on the specific conditions of each locality. Shangrao Prefecture first solved the power problem, which was used to drive the establishment of various factories. This is just one of many better practices. The problems in developing commune-run industry are complex, and the methods and experiences for solving these problems will also be diverse. Therefore, we must not only attach importance to the experience of Shangrao Prefecture, but also pay attention to studying and promoting all the good experiences of other regions. In this way, we can better achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical" in developing commune-run industry.

### 社办工业怎样做到多快好省？

    社办工业怎样做到多快好省？
    人民公社必须实行工农业同时并举的方针，必须大办工业。这是党的八届六中全会所肯定了的方针。但是，人民公社在发展工业上怎样才能做到多快好省？江西省上饶专区的人民公社提供了一个好的做法。这个地区人民公社的工业不仅发展得很快，而且他们办起来的各种工厂还有投资少、建设快、产品多、综合利用资源、管理方便、节省劳动力六大优点。
    上饶专区发展社办工业的做法之所以好，是因为这些做法符合党的八届六中全会所制定的公社办工业的原则，为当前发展社办工业提供了有益的经验。
    人民公社发展工业应当是有计划的。上饶专区的做法符合这个原则。人们常说，社办工业“遍地开花”，这是指的这种小型工业的群众性、广泛性而言，决不是说社办工厂可以随便在任何地方建设。社办工厂应当有个统一的规划，有个合理的布局，上饶专区按照本地的具体情况，围绕着水电站建立了一百多个小型的“工业群”，既避免了建厂中的盲目性，又为综合利用资源、节约资金提供了很好的条件。
    人民公社的工业生产，必须与农业生产密切结合，为农业生产服务。这一点，上饶专区也做得较好。那里围绕水电站建设的工厂，许多都是为本社的农产品加工的，在加工厂又附设了养猪场，利用加工后的副产物发展生猪生产；至于肥料厂，当然更是直接为发展农业服务的。可以肯定，这样与农业密切结合地发展工业，结果一定会促进农业的更大发展。
    人民公社的工业生产，必须贯彻因地制宜、就地取材的原则。上饶专区的做法也体现了这个精神。那里的主要农产品是水稻，因此各厂综合利用的资源也就以水稻为主。稻谷加工后，用粗糠加工作成饲料，用细糠榨油，然后又用糠饼酿酒或制饴糖，最后又用酒糟和糖糟养猪。在这里人们已把本地的农产品资源作了最大限度的利用，使一些原来经济价值很低的东西变成了经济价值很高的东西。
    上饶专区在发展社办工业中，还注意了因陋就简、以土代洋的节约精神。利用旧材料建厂房，或者利用旧房屋当厂房；一个大厂房里安装一部水轮机和少部分皮带，也尽量综合加以利用。正因为有这样勤俭办厂的精神，所以平均建设一个工厂最多只用八百元投资。
    人民公社发展工业生产的方针和原则已经确定了，现在的问题是如何根据各地的具体情况正确地贯彻这些方针、原则。上饶专区首先解决动力问题，用以带动各种工厂的兴办。这只是许多较好的做法当中的一种。发展社办工业当中的问题是复杂的，解决这些问题的方法和经验也会是多种多样的。因此我们不仅要重视上饶专区的经验，还要注意研究和推广其他地区的一切好经验。这样，在发展社办工业中就可以更好地做到多快好省。
