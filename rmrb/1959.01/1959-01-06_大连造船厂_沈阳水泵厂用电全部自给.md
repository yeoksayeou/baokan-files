Dalian Shipyard and Shenyang Pump Factory Achieve Complete Self-Sufficiency in Electricity

(Our correspondent from Lüda reports on the 5th) Dalian Shipyard vigorously launched a mass movement, independently manufacturing boilers, steam turbines, and generators. By New Year's Eve, they had built a total of twenty-seven large, medium, and small self-supplied power stations, currently achieving complete self-sufficiency in electricity. The daily power generation of Dalian Shipyard's self-supplied power stations is currently around 60,000 kilowatt-hours, and is gradually increasing. This electricity mainly comes from a large Yang power station with a capacity of 6,000 kilowatts, which the workers call the main force. In addition, each workshop, office, nursery, cafeteria, clinic, etc., also has its own small indigenous power station or a medium-sized power station combining indigenous and foreign methods, which the workers call the local troops. To overcome technical barriers, cadres, technicians, and workers implemented a three-way combination, organizing a power generation cooperative. The technicians designed several sets of indigenous boilers, indigenous turbines, and indigenous generators with capacities ranging from 400 kilowatts to 900 kilowatts. These devices are characterized by simple structures, using less steel, and not requiring silicon steel sheets. Chromium-molybdenum steel and chromium-vanadium steel were needed to manufacture parts such as steam turbine impellers, but they were not available anywhere. The workers dismantled alloy steel from old ships, and after chemical testing proved that it was completely usable, they re-smelted it nine times in a casting experimental furnace, meeting the needs. The precision requirements for turbine blades are very strict. The factory did not have very precise special milling machines. At first, the workers wanted to use lathes instead of milling machines, but after placing the blades on the lathe, no one dared to start the lathe for three days. To break through this key point, young worker Zhu Weiqin and others jointly created a jig that was installed on the lathe to turn the blades, increasing efficiency by more than double compared to foreign methods, while ensuring quality. Currently, Dalian Shipyard is continuing to build a large self-supplied power station, and the power generation in January this year is expected to reach 120,000 to 150,000 kilowatt-hours. The surplus electricity will be transmitted to the national power grid.

(Reported) The Shenyang Pump Factory achieved self-sufficiency in electricity by the end of last year.

The electricity consumption of the Shenyang Pump Factory is 5,200 kilowatt-hours. The factory's own power generation reached 5,767 kilowatt-hours, achieving self-sufficiency.

This factory needed to increase its electricity consumption to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, and the city's electricity supply was insufficient. Under these circumstances, after the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the entire party and all the people to generate electricity, the factory's Party committee immediately convened a meeting to specifically study the direction and methods of generating electricity. A member of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee was put in charge to specifically lead the power generation movement, and all workshops and groups in the factory were mobilized to take active action and generate electricity. In the two months of October and November, there was a mass upsurge of power generation with meetings talking about power generation, everywhere discussing power generation, and power generation every day. In the process of generating electricity, the Party committee promptly summarized and promoted advanced deeds and experiences in manufacturing power generation equipment. This factory, due to its firm implementation of the Party's policies, with the Party Committee personally taking charge, and vigorously mobilizing the masses and following the mass line, achieved self-sufficiency in electricity in just over two months.

    大连造船厂  沈阳水泵厂用电全部自给
    本报旅大5日电　大连造船厂大搞群众运动，自行制造锅炉、汽轮机和发电机，到新年前夕共建成了二十七个大中小型自备电站，目前用电全部自给。大连造船厂的自备电站，目前每日发电量为六万度左右。并且还在逐渐增加。这些电主要出自一座容量六千瓩的大洋电站，职工们叫它主力军。此外，各车间、科室、托儿所、食堂、医务所等也各有自己的小土电站或土洋结合的中型电站，职工们叫它地方部队。为了突破技术关，干部、技术人员和工人实行了三结合，组织了办电合作社。技术人员设计了几套四百瓩到九百瓩的土锅炉、土透平和土发电机，这些设备的特点是结构简单，用钢材少，不要矽钢片。造汽轮机叶轮等部件需要铬钼钢和铬钒钢，到处买不到，职工们就从旧船上拆下合金钢材，经过化验证明完全可用，于是用铸工试验炉回炼九次，就满足了需要。汽轮机上叶片精密度要求很严，这个厂没有很精密的专用铣床，开始时工人们想以车床代铣床，但是把叶片放在车床上以后，三天没有人敢动手车，为了突破这个关键，青年工人朱维勤等合作创造了一种胎具，按在车床上车叶片，效率比洋办法快一倍多，同时保住了质量。现在大连造船厂还在继续建造一个大型自备电站，今年1月份发电量可达到十二万到十五万度，自用多余部分将输送给国家电网。
    本报讯　沈阳水泵厂在去年年底做到了发电自给。
    沈阳水泵厂用电量为五千二百度，这个厂自己发电量达到了五千七百六十七度，做到了自给。
    这个厂生产跃进需要增加电量，又加全市电力供应不足，在这种情况下，当中共沈阳市委会号召全党全民动手办电之后，厂党委立即召开了会议，具体研究了办电方向和办电方法，并由一名党委常委负责，专门领导办电运动，同时动员全厂各车间各小组都积极行动起来，大家动手办电。在10月和11月两个月里，逢会讲办电、处处谈办电、天天都办电的群众办电热潮。在办电过程中，党委发现制造发电设备的先进事迹与经验，就及时总结推广。这个厂由于坚决贯彻了党的方针，党委亲自挂帅；同时大力发动了群众，走群众路线，在两个多月的时间里，就做到了用电自给。（附图片）
