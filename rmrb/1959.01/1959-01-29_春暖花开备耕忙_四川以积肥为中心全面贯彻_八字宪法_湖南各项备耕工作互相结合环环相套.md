Spring is Warm, Flowers are Blooming, and Preparations for Farming are Busy
	Sichuan Takes Accumulation of Manure as the Center to Comprehensively Implement the "Eight-Character Constitution"
	Hunan Integrates Various Farming Preparations, Linking Them Together

(Reported by this newspaper) People's communes in Sichuan Province are tightly grasping the "Eight-Character Constitution" and meticulously carrying out preparations for farming.

Now, from both sides of the Yangtze River to the mountains of northern Sichuan, there is a busy scene. In the fields, millions of laborers are fighting hard, braving wind and frost. When cattle cannot go into the fields, people roll up their trousers and jump into the paddy fields to pull plows. On mountains, rivers, dense forests, and grasslands, crowds of people are actively accumulating and making fertilizer everywhere. Local fertilizer plants are springing up like mushrooms after the rain in various places. The high-efficiency movement at more than 20,000 water conservancy construction sites across the province is also entering a climax. The broad masses of farmers are using soaring enthusiasm to turn winter into spring.

Last year, Sichuan Province's grain output exceeded one-tenth of the nation's total grain output. How can we strive for an even greater leap forward this year? Under the leadership of local Party committees, combined with rectification of the communes, by summarizing the superiority of the communes and the high-yield experiences of last year, the broad masses of people clearly realized that carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement and implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" are the central links in this year's leap forward. At the same time, according to last year's experience, to be proactive throughout the year, we must grasp it early and grasp the beginning. Preparations for farming throughout the province are generally more than a month earlier than last year.

In implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution," the broad masses of people first put their main efforts into the most urgent aspects, distinguishing between primary and secondary tasks, urgency and importance, with both a focus and general considerations. Therefore, fertilizer accumulation and preparation and tool preparation have become the center of the current farming preparation movement. In order to ensure the realization of more than 100,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and more than 30,000 jin of refined fertilizer per mu, more than 5,000 people's communes across the province have established a professional army for accumulating and making fertilizer, while also launching a mass movement, doing everything possible to open up fertilizer sources, and vigorously developing local fertilizers. In the past month, the number of local fertilizer plants in communes across the province has increased from more than 60,000 to more than 100,000. They can produce more than 100 kinds of local fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other different components. In terms of tool preparation, tool manufacturing activities centered on promoting spring plowing, improved agricultural tools, and repairing small agricultural tools have also been widely launched. At the same time, combined with daily production activities and small-scale shock movements, adjusting seeds, winter pest control, and land planning are all arranged and done by someone, so that the "Eight-Character Constitution" is fully implemented.

Under the leadership of the Party committee, the people's communes throughout the province strive to ensure that every preparation for farming activity also proceeds from reality and meets needs. On water conservancy construction sites, people first focus their attention on ensuring the irrigation needs of spring耕 farmland, and heavily repair small-scale water conservancy, thereby "blowing away the chaff to see the rice," using limited labor to strive for the best results. The selection criteria for good seeds are long ears, heavy grains, and many grains. Preparations for farming generally achieve arrangement, inspection, indicators, and quality.

In order to ensure preparations for farming are done quickly, well, and economically, in addition to grasping ideology, the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels in Sichuan are also heavily grasping technological revolution, grasping labor organization, and grasping inspection and supervision. Pilot projects of "cultivated gardens" at the county and district levels have been established in many places. The emergence of a large number of technical training classes has set off a new upsurge of learning technology in rural areas. Xichong, Nanchong, and other counties plan to open more than 40 technical training classes centered on the "Eight-Character Constitution" before spring plowing, which are now starting one after another.

(Reported by this newspaper) A vigorous and solid preparation for farming movement is being carried out enthusiastically in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province. Now, about 8 million male and female commune members are attacking fertilizer accumulation and cultivating spring harvest crops, carrying out water conservancy repairs, plowing, and other farming preparations every day. A spring-like scene has appeared in the fields of Jiangnan in winter: green manure, wheat, rape, and other spring harvest crops are all green.

This year, the deep plowing, water conservancy, and other farming preparation work in various places has been done better than in previous years. The province has basically eliminated the winter hardpan fields. The paddy fields are generally deeply ploughed to six or seven inches, which is one or two inches deeper than in previous years. In the past two months, more than 50,000 newly built and renovated reservoirs, ponds, and other projects have been completed throughout the province. The work of seed retention and selection in various places has also been grasped earlier and retained more fully than in previous years, and the seeds are pure.

At present, various places are prominently grasping the work of accumulating fertilizer and cultivating spring harvest crops. More than 4.77 million field-head pits have been established in various places throughout the province, and fertilizers have generally been fermented. Through a major inspection of farming preparation work, various places have strengthened the work of increasing the accumulation of farm manure. Some people's communes have also adopted the "five-determination" method of determining people, quantity, quality, time, and work points, and promoted simplified labor quotas in fertilizer accumulation, which greatly improved fertilizer accumulation efficiency and fertilizer quality. According to statistics on the 20th, more than 680,000 tons of various local fertilizers have been produced in various places throughout the province. In cultivating spring harvest crops, various places have universally carried out the upgrading movement of three types of seedlings, and applied cattle manure and plant ash to keep warm and prevent frost, and protect spring harvest crops from wintering.

The characteristics of this year's farming preparation work are: large scale, various farming preparation activities are combined with each other, linked together, and the work is relatively meticulous and solid. For example, deep plowing is combined with "three-light" pest control, field fumigation, and soil improvement in various places, and water conservancy repairs are combined with pond mud accumulation of fertilizer. Often, one action achieves multiple goals, which is conducive to solving the contradiction of insufficient labor, and it is conducive to the comprehensive development of farming preparation work. Recently, through studying and discussing the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the enthusiasm of various places is even greater, and they are pushing the farming preparation work to a new climax.

Another characteristic shown by the development of farming preparation work in various places this year is: vigorously making tool reforms and breaking through the labor shortage barrier. According to statistics on the 20th, more than 6,400 factories have been established on water conservancy construction sites throughout the province, and more than 2.69 million pieces of soil extraction, soil transportation, and compaction tools have been manufactured. At present, nearly 40,000 water conservancy construction sites throughout the province have basically achieved semi-mechanical construction, greatly improving work efficiency. Shaoyang Prefecture has universally promoted the method of blasting and extracting soil with quicklime. Generally, 15 jin of quicklime can blast 30 cubic meters of soil, and the work efficiency is increased by more than ten times. Changde Prefecture, which has many fields and little labor, promoted more than 1.1 million improved tools in water conservancy repairs, and the work efficiency increased from the original one cubic meter per person per day to 5.45 cubic meters. The completed earthwork has exceeded the same period last year by 60%, but the number of workers used has been reduced by 40%. (Hu Jian) (Attached picture)

    春暖花开备耕忙
    四川以积肥为中心全面贯彻“八字宪法”
    湖南各项备耕工作互相结合环环相套
    本报讯　四川省各地人民公社紧紧抓住“八字宪法”，正在细致地进行备耕活动。
    现在，从长江两岸到川北山区已是一片繁忙景象。田野上，几百万劳动大军正冒着风霜坚持战斗。牛不能下田，翻犁冬田的人们就挽起裤腿跳下水田去拉犁。山上河里，密林草地，到处活跃着积肥造肥的人群。土化肥厂雨后春笋般在各地建立。全省两万多处水利工地的高工效运动也正进入高潮。广大农民用冲天的干劲，把冬天变成了春天。
    去年，四川省的粮食产量超过全国粮食总产量的十分之一。今年怎样争取更大跃进？在各地党委领导下，结合整社，通过总结公社优越性和去年高产经验，使广大群众明确地认识到开展大面积高产运动，贯彻“八字宪法”，是今年跃进的中心环节。同时，根据去年经验，要使全年主动必须抓早、抓开头。全省普遍比去年备耕提早了一个多月。
    在贯彻“八字宪法”中，广大群众把主攻力量首先投入到最迫切的方面去，分清主次缓急，既有重点，又照顾一般。因此，肥积造肥和准备工具成为当前备耕运动的中心。为了保证实现每亩有粗肥十万斤，精肥三万斤以上，全省五千多个人民公社纷纷建立了一支积肥造肥的专业大军，同时大搞全民运动，千方百计开辟肥源，大力发展土化肥。近一个月中，全省公社土化肥厂已从六万多个发展到十万个以上。能生产含氮、磷、钾各种不同成分的土化肥达一百多种。工具准备方面，以推广春耕改良农具和整修小农具为中心的工具制造活动也普遍展开。和这同时，结合日常生产活动和小突击运动，调剂种籽、冬季治虫、田地规划等也都样样有安排，样样有人做，从而使“八字宪法”全面贯彻。
    在党委领导下，全省人民公社努力使每一项备耕活动也都同样从实际出发，切合需要。水利工地上，人们首先把注意力放在保证春耕田地的灌溉需要方面，大修小型水利，从而“吹糠见米”，用有限的劳力争取最好的效果。良种选择标准是穗长、粒重、粒多。备耕工作一般都做到有布置、有检查、有指标、有质量。
    为了保证备耕多快好省，四川各地中共党委除了抓思想外，还大抓技术革命，抓劳力组织和抓检查督促。以县、区为单位的“耕作园田化”的试点已在许多地方建立。大量技术训练班的出现，在农村中已掀起了一个新的学技术的热潮。西充、南充等县计划在春耕前开办以“八字宪法”为中心的四十多个技术训练班现正陆续开学。
    本报讯　一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的备耕运动，正在湖南省广大农村热火朝天地开展着。现在，每天约有八百多万男女社员突击积肥和培育春收作物，开展修水利、翻耕等备耕活动。江南田野已出现冬天里的春天景象：绿肥、小麦、油菜等春收作物，到处一片嫩绿。
    今年各地的深耕、水利等备耕工作都较往年做得好。全省基本上消灭了过冬板田。水稻田一般深耕到六、七寸，较往年深一、两寸。两个月来，全省已完成新建、整修的水库、山塘等工程五万多处。各地的留种、选种工作，也较往年抓得早，留得足，种子纯。
    目前，各地突出地抓住积肥和培育春收作物工作。全省各地已建立田头大氹四百七十七万多个，一般都沤制了肥料。各地通过备耕工作大检查，都加强了增积农家肥料工作。有些人民公社还采取了定人、定量、定质、定时间、定工分的“五定”办法，在积肥中推行了简易的劳动定额，大大提高了积肥工效和肥料质量。据20日统计，全省各地已生产各种土化肥六十八万多吨。各地在培育春收作物中，普遍开展了三类苗升级运动，并追施牛粪、草木灰，保温防冻，保护春收作物过冬。
    今年备耕工作的特点是：规模大，各项备耕活动互相结合，环环相套，工作比较细致、扎实。比如，各地深耕结合“三光”除虫、田间熏土、改良土壤等工作，修水利结合挑塘泥积肥。往往一举数得，既有利于解决劳力不足的矛盾，而且有利于全面开展备耕工作。最近，各地通过学习、讨论党的八届六中全会文件，干劲更大，正把备耕工作推向新的高潮。
    今年各地开展备耕工作所显示出的另一个特点是：大闹工具改革，突破劳力不足关。据20日统计，全省水利工地办起工厂六千四百多处，已制造取土、运土、夯压等工具二百六十九万多件。目前，全省有近四万处水利工地，基本上实现了半机械施工，大大提高了工效。邵阳专区普遍推广了生石灰爆破取土法，一般每十五斤生石灰可以爆破三十公方土，工效提高十多倍。田多劳力少的常德专区在修水利中推广一百一十多万件改良工具，工效由原来每人每天一公方提高到五点四五方。目前已完成的土石方超过去年同时期60％，但用工数却减少40％。　（胡坚）（附图片）
