　　I traveled more than twenty li of mountain road, and it was dusk when I arrived at the Xiyang bus station. I asked, and it happened that there was a last bus going to Yangquan, so I bought a ticket and waited at this small station. Perhaps because it was the last bus, there weren't many passengers. Some people were playing poker; a mother was nursing her child while dozing off...

　　I found a seat by the window and looked outside. Opposite me was a range of mountains, near and far. In the dim light of the night, the shadows of the mountains looked like a light ink painting. With the reflection of the rising moon, the mountains appeared particularly moving.

　　Next to me was a rural girl wearing a floral padded jacket and a light blue headscarf. She was walking back and forth, looking restless. Every so often, she would ask me what time it was, as if she had something urgent. But from her face, she seemed so calm and peaceful. We told her that there was at least an hour and a half before the bus left, and then we quickly started talking.

　　"I must catch the train to Taiyuan today, because tomorrow the provincial conference of women activists will officially begin. I didn't catch up with everyone else a few days ago," she said quickly, seeming to be a very talkative girl. I became interested in meeting such a woman activist representative by chance, and naturally, I asked her many questions about herself.

　　"How should I say it? I really haven't done anything much! My home is in Dazhai Village, which is more than ten li away from here. After graduating from senior primary school in 1957, I returned to the village to work as the commune's accountant. In February 1958, the county organized a training class for artificial insemination of sheep, to train sheep breeders for each agricultural cooperative. We had a breeder in our cooperative, but when the time came, that young man refused to go no matter what. He said that doing this was tiring and embarrassing, and he wouldn't do it even if you put a knife to his throat! This made our cooperative director, Uncle Chen Yonggui, very difficult. No matter how much he persuaded, it was no use. So Uncle Gui called me over and asked me to receive the training. I said, if the men don't want to do it, why shouldn't I be ashamed? Uncle Gui told me that it wasn't unusual for women to do artificial insemination work anymore. There were countless women doing it all over the province and the country. You are a completely liberated woman and a member of the Communist Youth League. What men can do, you can definitely do! Uncle Gui was right, and I had nothing to say.

　　"The next day, at the commune members' meeting, Uncle Gui indeed nominated me, and the commune members all agreed. That night, Uncle Gui found me in his house again and said to me warmly, you should leave early tomorrow morning, this is a task assigned to you by the Party! Uncle Gui watched me grow up, and I always thought he saw me as a child. Now he was educating me so earnestly and seriously that I really didn't know what to say..."

　　Without knowing when, several people had sat down next to us, and they were also quietly listening to her story.

　　"The next morning, I went to register. As soon as I entered, my face turned red. There was a room full of people studying, but I was the only woman. I sat down to the side with my head down, unable to say a word.

　　"Later, when I started studying, with the enthusiastic help of the teachers and classmates, I forgot that I was a woman. I spoke and discussed things during my studies without any reservations. But when it was almost time to graduate and start practicing, I suddenly caught a severe cold and fell ill. I had a terrible headache and a high fever. While I was sick, I seemed to hear someone saying that I was afraid to do the real thing and was faking illness. When I heard that, I couldn't wait to get up and do the experiment, but I didn't expect to be delirious for seven days and seven nights..."

　　The sound of gongs and drums came from outside the window. We all stood up and looked out. A group of students lined up and stopped in front of the station. Someone said that this was to welcome the delegation from other provinces who were here to visit the county's cultural work. After the sound of gongs and drums stopped, people urged her to continue her story.

　　"While I was sick, I had to read more technical books. As soon as I recovered, the school had already stopped classes, so I went around looking for classmates to catch up. In early May, the sheep started to go into heat, and I learned all the operating techniques. When I returned to the cooperative, I prepared all the equipment and cleaned the operating room, waiting for people to send sheep for breeding. But three days passed in vain. On the fourth day, someone finally sent a sheep.

　　"That day, there were so many people watching! Some young men were even shouting. What was there to shout about, really!" As she said this, the people around us all laughed, and she herself laughed too.

　　"Once, a ram pushed me down a slope more than ten feet high with its horns, and it hurt so much! I felt very wronged, but when I looked at the men next to me, I got up and continued working. Gradually, people were willing to help, and there were fewer people gossiping.

　　"In order to complete the sheep breeding task for 1958, I braved wind and rain and traveled sixty or seventy li of mountain road to Zhanshang Township to sign a breeding contract. I lived there for more than forty days and inseminated more than four thousand ewes, with a conception rate of 99%. All of the eligible ewes in our cooperative were 100% inseminated." When we heard this, we couldn't help but laugh happily again. The girl brushed the short hair in front of her head and said to us, "It's a pity that you're all leaving here. Otherwise, I'd really like to take you to our cooperative to see those little lambs!"

　　The station attendant ran over to tell us that the bus from Yangquan had arrived. We all packed our things and prepared to get on the bus. At this time, the students' gongs and drums sounded again. The members of the visiting delegation from the Northeast got off the bus, and we squeezed onto the bus in this crowded and lively small station. Just as the bus was about to leave, I remembered that I should ask the girl's name. She laughed and shouted, "My name is Jia Cunyan!" From her cheerful voice, I felt that she seemed to be speaking not only to me, but also that she was about to attend such a conference, and how happy she must be! (Attached picture)

    绵羊姑娘
    江之水
    我赶了二十多里的山路，到昔阳汽车站的时候已是黄昏了。问了一声，刚巧还有最末一班车开往阳泉，于是我买了票就在这小站上等候着开车。也许因为是最末一班车了，旅客并不算多，有几个人正在打扑克；有位母亲一边奶着孩子一边在打盹……。
    我找到靠窗的位子坐下来，从窗内外望，对面是一片远远近近的山。夜色苍茫中群山的影子就像一幅淡淡的水墨画，加上初升的月亮的映照，群山就显得分外动人了。
    在我的旁边，有一位穿着花布棉袄，脖上围了一条浅蓝色头巾的农村姑娘，走来走去的很不安静，她隔一会就问问我几点钟了，好像有什么急事似的，但从她那脸上看，却又显得那么安详。我们告诉她离开车至少还有一个半小时，接着也就很快地交谈起来了。
    “我一定要在今天搭上去太原的火车，明天全省的妇女积极分子代表会就要正式开会了。我前几天没有赶上跟大家一块走。”她说得很急促，看来是个很爱说话的姑娘。我为偶然地遇到这样一位妇女积极分子代表而发生了兴趣，自然，就问了她许多关于她自己的事情。
      “怎么说呢？我可真没做啥事哪！我家是离此十多里路的大寨村，1957年高小毕业后就回村当了社里的会计。1958年2月，县里举办了绵羊人工授精训练班，要训练各农业社的绵羊配种员。我们社里原来有个配种员，到时候那个小伙子却说什么也不去了。他说，干这事又累又丢人，把刀放在我脖子上我也不去！这下可把我们的社主任陈永桂大叔难住了，左劝右劝都不行，桂大叔就把我叫了去，让我去受训。我说，男的都不愿干，我怎么就不怕羞呢！桂大叔跟我说，妇女干人工配种工作已经不是稀罕事了，全省全国不知有多少，你是个彻底解放了的妇女，又是个共青团员，男人能干的你一定能干！大叔说的也对，我无话可说了。
    “第二天开社员大会时，大叔果然提名选我，社员们也都一致同意。夜里，桂大叔又把我找到他屋子里，亲热地跟我说，明天一早你就走吧，这是党交给你的任务！桂大叔是看着我长大的，我一直以为他拿我当小孩子看，如今他这样认真严肃地教育我，我心里简直不知说什么好……。”
    不知什么时候，在我们的旁边又坐下了几个人，他们也静静地听着她的叙述。
    “第二天早上，我就前去报到了，一进门就把我的脸烧个通红，来学习的有一大屋子人，但是只有我一个是女的，我低着头坐在一旁，一句话也说不上来。
    “后来一学习起来，再搭上老师和同学们都热心地帮助我，我也就把自己是个女人的事给忘了。我学习时有说有讲，毫无顾虑。可是快要毕业进行实习的时候，我突然得了重感冒病倒了，那时我头痛发烧得很厉害。病中，我仿佛听到有人说我是不敢动真的，装起病来了。我听了恨不得马上爬起来去做试验，但是没想到我整整迷糊了七天七夜……。”
    窗外传来了锣鼓声，我们都站起来往外看了看，一群排着队的学生就在站前停下来了。有人说这是欢迎外省来参观县文化工作的代表团的。锣鼓声停下来以后，人们又催她接着说下去。
    “病中我只好多看些技术书，病刚好，学校已经停课了，我就四处找同学去补课。5月初，羊开始发情了，我把一切操作技术都学会了。回到社里，我把器材准备好，把操作室也打扫得干干净净的等着人们送羊来配种，但是三天白白地过去了，到第四天头上才有人送了羊来。
    “那一天，看热闹的人才多呢，有些小伙子们竟围着喊叫起来，有什么可喊叫的呢，真是！”说到这里，我们围听的几个人都笑了，连她自己也笑了。
    “有一次，一只种羊用角把我推到一丈多高的土坡下，把我摔得好痛啊！我心里感到很委屈，可是看了看一旁的男人们，我又爬起来接着干下去了。人们见了慢慢都愿意来帮忙了，说闲话的人也少了。
      “为了完成1958年的绵羊配种任务，我曾经冒着风雨走了六七十里的山路到沾尚乡去订了配种合同，我在那里一连住了四十多天，共配了四千多只母羊，受胎率达到99％。我们社里的适龄母羊都百分之百的受了胎。”我们听到这里，不由得又都高兴地笑了，姑娘用手掠了掠头前的短发对我们说：“可惜你们都要离开这里了，要不我真愿意领你们到我们社里去看看那些小绵羊呢！”
    车站服务员跑来告诉我们从阳泉来的车已经到站了，我们都收拾好东西准备着上车。这时学生们的锣鼓声又响了起来，由东北来的参观团的人们都从车上下来，我们也就在这一片拥挤而热闹的小站上挤上了汽车。临到车快开的时候，我才又想起应该问一声姑娘的名字了。她笑着嚷道：“我叫贾存眼！”从她那爽朗的声音里，我感到她好像不止在说给我一个人听似的；同时也让人觉得她就要去参加那么一个大会了，她心里该有多么高兴啊！（附图片）
