Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th: According to TASS, New York, Mikoyan attended a banquet held by the New York Economic Society in the “Waldorf Astoria Hotel” hall on the evening of the 14th, where he addressed representatives of the American business community. More than a thousand industrialists, businessmen, financial capitalists, and other business people attended the banquet.

The club director, Harry, when introducing Mikoyan to the attendees, said that such an introduction was actually unnecessary. After Mikoyan began his extraordinary visit to the United States, American newspapers reported on this visit extremely extensively, and therefore everyone knows him.

Mikoyan's appearance on the podium and the words he used from the beginning about the necessity of peaceful coexistence earned friendly applause.

Mikoyan said that our participation in this banquet today has a certain symbolic significance. We are communists, and you are capitalists. We do not feel uncomfortable sitting together, because we all realize the necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems—our country and your country. We hope that everyone can work peacefully in their own way, without interfering with others living according to their own will. As the saying goes, "Live and let live."

We have differences now, and of course, there will be differences in the future. Then let us argue and stick to our views, but let's not fight (applause).

Some time ago, some people said that it seemed that the Soviet Union had adopted a military threat against the United States. It is gratifying that recently such arguments have been less frequent. Everyone knows that even in the past, this statement was incorrect and did not conform to reality.

Now some people say that the United States is suffering from an economic threat from our side that is more terrible than a military threat. This statement, like those previous conjectures, is unfounded. We want to increase our country's commodity production by 80% in seven years and greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of our people. Gentlemen, if the Soviets eat as much meat and drink as much milk as you do, what kind of threat is that? If everything is abundant in our Soviet Union, what kind of threat will it pose to you?

Here, Mr. Harry, the chairman of our meeting, has talked about how many refrigerators, televisions, etc. you have. If we also have an abundance of these commodities, gentlemen, would that threaten you? Please stop scaring yourselves and scaring others. We should have more exchanges, do more business, exchange more opinions, and better understand each other. Then the fear will disappear, and real peace can be established between our two countries, and the "Cold War" can end.

I am often asked what things we can buy and sell, what we can sell to you, and what we can buy from you.

There was a time when you American businessmen knew very well what you could buy from us and sell to us, but recently, since the Cold War began, you have forgotten this point and forgotten how to do business. This is not surprising, because someone has created many obstacles on the road of your trade with us.

There used to be a trade agreement between our two countries, but it was abolished by the United States. Even tariffs on Soviet commodities such as fur and canned crab meat, which do not compete with you, are set very high. There is a long list of goods specifying which goods can be exported to the Soviet Union and which cannot.

Henry Ford did business with us in the past. At that time, the American government had not yet recognized us, but Ford did not ask the government for permission to trade, and as a result, he did the right thing. Later, the American government understood that Ford did the right thing. Diplomatic relations were established between our two countries. But now, if businessmen want to trade with us, they have to hire a large number of lawyers to study these lists of permitted and prohibited exports, to analyze what can be bought and sold and what cannot. For example, we once negotiated with your company to supply us with some chemical plant equipment. It seemed that everything was settled, but we have not yet received a final reply. We asked, what's going on? We were told that permission from the State Department had not been obtained and the issue was still under study. In this way, during the period they are considering a solution, we naturally transferred the order to another country (laughter, applause).

Some of the items on the list of goods prohibited from being sold to the Soviet Union are very good material for your magazine's humor writers. To show that I am not just talking empty words, I can give some examples. You are allowed to sell old wooden furniture to the Soviet Union, but the sale of… firewood is prohibited (laughter). And we, as everyone knows, are also exporters of timber and wooden furniture (laughter).

You are allowed to sell us laxatives, although we do not need laxatives. Presumably, some people think that laxatives can weaken the power of our rockets (applause).

You are allowed to sell metal wire for hanging pictures to the Soviet Union, but stainless steel is not included. It seems that someone knows that stainless steel is used on rockets, so they are unwilling to give it to us (laughter).

I won't say more about this kind of example. Don't such laughable things damage the reputation of the United States, American activists, and American business people?

I want to mention something that makes people happy: recently, many famous American activists have visited the Soviet Union, including Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Humphrey, Mr. Lippmann, Mrs. Roosevelt, Eric Johnston, and others. They sincerely observed our lives when they were there and tried to objectively tell their people what they saw in the Soviet Union. They saw that the Soviet people and the government want peace and only want peace, and hope to implement peaceful cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and recognition of each other's interests (applause).

On the other hand, many Soviets have been to your United States. They also got a good impression after learning about your people and your country. During our visit to the United States, we talked to many Americans. It can be said that ordinary Americans want peace. The American businessmen we met also said they hoped to improve relations between us. We have no reason not to believe them, and we are happy to hear these words.

However, the United States still has many prejudices and biases against the Soviet Union. Both sides should do a lot of work to build trust in our relationship. Of course, this is not easy, but it must be done. We like to hear good words, but we hope that these words can be confirmed in action. But the current actions of the US government have not eliminated our distrust. There is no Soviet military base near the United States, but there are many American military bases around our country, and the number of these military bases is constantly increasing. Our disarmament proposals have not been adopted, and the arms race is still going on. Your military budget is constantly increasing. Our proposals to ease international tensions have not been supported by you. We propose to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, but your leaders are unwilling. We hope to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city with international guarantees. All of this has been rejected. One cannot help but ask, why are all these constructive proposals of the Soviet Union aimed at easing international tensions met with negative answers: no, no, no? Let us work together to change the answer to: yes, yes, yes (applause).

    米高扬在纽约经济学会宴会上讲话
    不同制度国家应该和平共处
    可笑的禁运政策对美国人很不体面
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社纽约15日讯：米高扬14日晚间应邀出席了纽约经济学会在“华道夫·亚斯多里亚饭店”大厅中举行的宴会，在宴会上他向美国实业界的代表们讲了话。出席宴会的有一千多名工业家、商人、金融资本家和其他实业界人士。
    俱乐部主任哈利在向参加宴会的人介绍米高扬时说，这种介绍本来是没有必要的，当米高扬在美国开始了不寻常的访问之后，美国报纸极其广泛地报道了这次访问，因而大家都知道他。
    米高扬在讲台上的出现和一开始就谈到和平共处的必要性的话，博得了友好的掌声。
      米高扬说，今天我们参加这次宴会具有某种象征性意义。我们是共产主义者，而你们是资本家，我们坐在一起并不感到不舒服，因为我们大家都意识到不同社会制度的国家——我们的国家和你们的国家和平共处的必要性。我们希望每个人在自己那里按照自己的方式和平地劳动，不干扰别人按照自己的意志生活，俗话说得好，“你活，也让别人活”。
    我们现在有分歧，当然，今后还会有。那末就让我们展开争论，坚持自己的观点，但是不要打仗（掌声）。
    前些时候有人说，似乎苏联对美国采取了军事威胁。可喜的是，近来这种论调少了，大家知道，即使在过去，这种说法也是不正确的，是不符合实际的。
    现在有人说，美国正遭受着一种来自我们这方面的比军事威胁更为可怕的经济威胁。这种说法和以前的那些臆断一样，是没有根据的。我们想在七年内把我国商品增产80％，大大提高我国人民的物质文化水平。各位先生，如果苏联人将吃跟你们一样多的肉和喝跟你们一样多的牛奶，这算是什么威胁呢？如果我们苏联一切都很充裕，这会给你们造成什么样的威胁呢？
    这里，我们这次会议的主席哈利先生谈到过，你们有多少冰箱、电视机等等。如果我们这些商品也将很充裕，各位先生，这难道会威胁你们吗？请不要再吓唬自己和吓唬别人了。我们应当更多地交往，更多地做买卖，更多地交换意见，更好地互相了解，那时恐惧心理就会消失，我们两国之间就能树立起真正的和平，“冷战”就能结束。
    常常有人问我，我们可以买卖什么东西，可以卖给我们什么和向我们买什么？
    曾经有过这样的时期，那时你们美国商人知道得很清楚，可以向我们买些什么和卖些什么，但是近来，自从冷战开始以来，你们忘记了这点，忘记如何做买卖了。这也不值得奇怪，因为在你们同我们进行贸易的道路上有人制造了许多障碍。
    我们两国之间曾经有过贸易协定，但被美国废除了。甚至对毛皮和蟹肉罐头这样一些并不同你们竞争的苏联商品，关税也订得很高。有一长串的货单规定哪些商品可以对苏联输出，哪些不行。
    过去亨利·福特同我们做过生意，那时美国政府还没有承认我们，而福特没有请求政府允许他贸易，结果他做对了。后来美国政府理解到福特做对了。我们两国之间就建立了外交关系。而现在，商人们如果想同我们贸易，就得聘请一大批律师来研究这些允许和禁止输出的货单，来分析什么可以买卖，什么不行。举个例子说，我们曾同你们的公司谈判过供给我们某些化学工厂装备，看来似乎一切都谈妥了，但直到现在还没有接到最后的答复。我们问，这是怎么回事？回答我们说，还没有得到国务院的允许，问题还在研究。这么一来，在他们考虑解决的期间，我们很自然地就把这笔订货移到别国去了（笑声，掌声）。
    在禁止卖给苏联的货物项目单中有些东西是很可以作为你们杂志的幽默作家的好材料的。为了说明我不是空口说白话，可以举些例子。你们允许卖给苏联旧木器，但禁止出售……木柴（笑声）。而我们，大家知道，自己也是输出木材和木器的（笑声）。
    允许卖给我们泻药，虽然我们并不需要泻药。大概有人认为，泻药能够削弱我们火箭的力量（掌声）。
    允许卖给苏联挂画用的金属丝，但不锈钢制的不在此例。这看来是因为有人知道，火箭上是要用不锈钢的，所以就不愿给我们（笑声）。
    这类例子我不再多说了。这样一些令人发笑的东西难道不有损美国、美国的活动家和美国实业界人士的体面吗？
    我想提一件使人高兴的事：最近有许多著名的美国活动家访问了苏联，其中有史蒂文森、汉弗莱、李普曼诸位先生，罗斯福夫人、埃里克·约翰斯顿等。他们到我们那里诚恳地观察了我们的生活，并设法把他们在苏联看到的东西客观地告诉自己的人民。他们看到了苏联人民和政府希望和平，而且只希望和平，希望在平等、彼此尊重和承认彼此利益的基础上实行和平合作（掌声）。
    另一方面，很多苏联人到过你们美国。他们在了解了你们人民、你们国家以后也获得了好印象。在访问美国期间，我们和很多美国人谈过话，可以说，普通的美国人是希望和平的。我们所遇到的美国实业家也说他们希望改善我们之间的关系。我们没有理由不相信他们，我们听到这些话感到高兴。
    可是美国对苏联仍然有许多成见和偏见。双方都应该作许多工作在我们的关系中建立信任。当然，这件事不是轻易的，然而是必须做的。我们喜欢听到好话，但是我们希望这些话能够在行动中得到证实。可是目前美国政府的行动没有消除我们的不信任。美国附近没有一个苏联的军事基地，可是在我国的周围却有许多美国的军事基地，而且这些军事基地的数量还在不断增加。我们关于裁军的建议没有被采纳，军备竞赛仍在继续进行。你们的军事预算不断增加。我们关于缓和国际紧张局势的建议没有得到你们的支持。我们建议缔结对德和约，你们的领导人不愿意。我们希望把西柏林变成由国际保证的非军事化自由城市。这一切都被拒绝了。不禁要问，为什么苏联这些旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建设性建议全都受到否定的回答：不，不，不呢？让我们共同努力使回答变成为：对，对，对吧（掌声）。
