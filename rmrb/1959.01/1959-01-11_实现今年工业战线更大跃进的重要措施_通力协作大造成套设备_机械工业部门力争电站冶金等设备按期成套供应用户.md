Xinhua News Agency, 10th: In accordance with the requirements of the law of planned and proportionate development, China's machinery industry departments have paid great attention to strengthening the supporting work of equipment from the beginning of this year. Under the instructions of the State Council and the supervision of various enterprises, the First Ministry of Machine Building has taken a series of important measures to strive to ensure that the important equipment they produce, especially power stations, metallurgy and other equipment, can be supplied to users in complete sets on schedule in the new year, so as to give full play to the role of the equipment as soon as possible.

In order to meet the needs of various departments of the national economy, China's machinery industry will develop at a higher speed this year, and the output of important equipment such as power stations, metallurgy, chemical industry, and coal will increase greatly. These equipments are not only large in quantity, but also extremely complex in composition. It often requires dozens or even more factories to cooperate in production at the same time to make and install them into complete sets for production. Therefore, rationally arranging the production of various machinery enterprises and vigorously organizing the matching of equipment is a very important task for the machinery industry departments to further improve the manufacturing level and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production this year.

The measures taken by the First Ministry of Machine Building to strengthen the supporting work are first of all to balance production plans and material allocation. For important equipment such as power station equipment and rolling mills, not only the production plan of the main engine is arranged, but also the production of auxiliary equipment and cooperative products is specifically arranged; not only the material supply of the main engine is guaranteed, but also the material supply of auxiliary equipment is arranged. Appropriate adjustments are now being made to the links in the original equipment production that are not complete. In order to strengthen the inspection of the supporting work, the State Basic Construction Commission, the State Economic Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power have also jointly formed six inspection teams to go to various places to work.

Establishing supporting management agencies is another important measure to ensure the smooth progress of the supporting work. The First Ministry of Machine Building has formed a General Company for Complete Sets of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment based on the Production Dispatch Bureau of the Ministry, and set up complete set companies and branch companies in Shanghai, Harbin, Tianjin, Xi'an, Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Taiyuan and other places. The main tasks of complete set companies at all levels are: to prepare annual and quarterly equipment matching plans according to the scope of equipment matching; to sign contracts with production factories and user units according to the plans arranged by the state, and be responsible for supplying complete sets of equipment.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some factories that specialized in producing parts and auxiliary machines were changed to produce main equipment, and industrial enterprises realized diversified operations, which is a good phenomenon in industrial development. However, since the new factories producing parts and auxiliary machines have not yet developed accordingly, there has been a phenomenon of decoupling between some main engines, auxiliary machines, especially maintenance. This is a big problem for ensuring the completion of equipment. In order to change this situation, the First Ministry of Machine Building is formulating specific measures to strive to rapidly increase the production capacity of parts and auxiliary machines, and adjust some enterprises to concurrently or exclusively assume part of the maintenance tasks, so as to solve this weak link.

Equipment matching is an extremely important and extremely complex work. It not only requires internal cooperation in the machinery industry, but also requires the joint efforts of units that produce equipment and units that use equipment in order to truly achieve the purpose of using the equipment for production once it is installed. To this end, in addition to deciding to further strengthen cooperation with various units, the First Ministry of Machine Building is also working with relevant departments to compile a "Handbook on the Scope of Complete Sets of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment," and through this measure, delineate the scope, divide responsibilities, and jointly do a good job in completing important equipment.

Harbin gives full play to the role of modern factories

Our newspaper, Harbin, 10th: Harbin City organizes the city's machinery and electrical industry for large-scale cooperation, and goes all out to accelerate the completion of a complete set of 210,000-kilowatt power station equipment and 12 sets of medium-sized steel plant blast furnaces, electric furnaces, and rolling equipment.

In undertaking the manufacture of this batch of supporting metallurgical and power station equipment, Harbin City not only gave full play to the role of large-scale modern machinery factories such as electrical machinery factories, electric meter instrument factories, boiler factories, and steam turbine factories newly built during the first five-year plan period to manufacture large main engines and special parts, but also gave full play to the production capacity of more than 40 local machinery factories such as Jilian Machinery Factory and Qunli Machinery Factory. Without large machine tools and large cranes, they manufactured more than 1,200 indigenous machine tools and building block machine tools, using small machine tools to do big work, and processing the main engines and parts of these large complete sets of equipment in the open air in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. Harbin City also actively gave play to the specialties of universities and handicraft cooperatives in organizing the manufacture of this batch of complete sets of equipment. For example, the precise automatic signaling, automatic recording thermal power instruments, and electronic instruments required for power station equipment were all trial-produced by the instrument factory of Harbin Institute of Technology and the Longjiang Instrument Factory upgraded from a handicraft cooperative. This instrument factory has been able to manufacture advanced instruments such as resistance thermometers and electronic potentiometers.

The complete sets of power station and smelting equipment parts organized by Harbin City in September last year have been shipped out of the factory one after another to newly built steel and power station bases in Guangxi, Yunnan and other countries. Among them, 12 sets of 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces can be shipped out completely in January, and 11 sets of 400 mm rolling mill units can also be fully equipped in the first quarter. The 210,000-kilowatt power station equipment has completed more than 70,000 kilowatts of main engine equipment tasks.

Harbin City has also recently jointly organized inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of the supply and production of complete sets of equipment in key construction projects and production units, and carried out necessary allocation and solved the production organization work for complete set omissions, so that complete sets of equipment can be completed as soon as possible, and key construction projects can be put into production quickly.

Chongqing's overall planning and self-reliance

Our newspaper, Chongqing, 10th: Chongqing's machinery industry departments are doing everything possible to solve the problem of mechanical matching through self-reliance.

At the beginning of this year, Chongqing City arranged the task of producing supporting machinery while arranging the task of producing the main engine. At the same time, on the basis of many factories temporarily rushing to produce supporting tasks such as electrical equipment last year, further overall planning and division of labor were carried out. Chongqing City originally had very few factories producing mechanical supporting equipment. In the fourth quarter of last year, due to the heavy task of mechanical production, all mechanical factories in the city, regardless of size, undertook part of the task of trial-producing and producing mechanical supporting products, but most of them were still temporary tasks, and it was not enough to produce in a step-by-step manner according to the sequential needs of matching. At the beginning of this year, attention was paid to changing this situation, and many factories made relatively appropriate arrangements and reasonable division of labor and longer-term planning. For example, the Chongqing Electrical Switch Factory, which used to produce all electrical switches, is now planned to only undertake the task of producing high-voltage electrical switches, and low-voltage electrical switches are handed over to district-owned switch factories for production. The Chongqing Instrument Factory, which used to produce whatever it had, has now been planned to become a specialized factory for producing thermal power instruments and electrical instruments. Generators, motors, transformers, etc. are also divided according to the production capacity of each factory to produce products of different models and capacities. In this way, each factory can have long-term plans in terms of personnel training, production equipment, etc., and it is more guaranteed to improve the quality and quantity of products. At the same time, the trial production of new products has been strengthened.

In order to overcome the shortage of raw materials and speed up the production of mechanical matching, the city's machinery industry departments have strengthened the reform of technical design. Engineering and technical personnel from various units were organized to form a product structure simplification design team to conduct necessary simplification and elimination of supporting products through experimental research to ensure quality. In this way, the time for producing complete sets of electrical equipment and the use of raw materials are greatly saved. All simplified product designs have been carefully reviewed by relevant departments and have now been put into production one after another.

Wuhan: putting others first and supplying in time

Our newspaper, Wuhan, 10th: The staff and workers of Wuhan's mechanical and electrical industrial enterprises have been engaged in large-scale cooperation in the past three or four months to produce complete sets of equipment, which has accelerated the progress of national construction. The complete sets of blast furnace equipment they produced have been installed in Hubei Steel Plant, Hanyang Steel Plant, Yangtze Steel Plant and others one after another. Some equipment that has not yet been completed, such as rolling mills, is currently being rushed to manufacture, and the complete sets of products and parts are being assembled.

Wuhan's mechanical and electrical industry, which used to be small-scale and single-production, has now been able to produce large-scale complete sets of products due to the revolutionary efforts of the vast number of staff and workers in the past year. From the beginning of last year to the present, the complete sets of equipment include 30 sets of 83.5-cubic-meter, 55-cubic-meter and 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces, 150 sets of 0.5-ton converters, and 2 sets of 1.5-ton converters. In addition, 9 250×3 and 300×5 rolling mills, more than 2,000 blowers, more than 5,000 motors, ball mills, crushers, air compressors, etc. were also produced. Many complete sets of products were almost all produced in the fourth quarter of last year.

Large-scale cooperation is an important method for Wuhan to carry out mechanical matching. As early as June last year, Wuhan City held a city-wide cooperation meeting; later, various meetings were held one after another to ideologically solve the parochialism of some units who were afraid of trouble and loss. With the gradual solution of ideological problems, the cooperation system organized by complete sets has gradually formed. At specialized cooperation meetings, relevant cooperative factories and mines clarified the cooperative tasks and included these tasks in their factory's production plan. In the production cooperation, many factories have emerged with examples of putting others first, being proactive and active. Wuhan Foundry Factory undertook the cooperation of metallurgical design castings for Wuhan Machinery Factory in November last year, which has this spirit of putting others first. They made models, modified designs, and urged the other party to pick up the goods, which greatly accelerated the assembly progress of Wuhan Machinery Factory. The supply of castings is an important key to the matching of blast furnaces. The staff and workers of this factory proposed to ensure "when to supply, when to supply." When Wuhan General Second Factory undertook the manufacture of five sets of 28-cubic-meter blast furnace equipment, it was at a loss for milling teeth. At this time, Wuhan Machine Tool Factory, Hanyang Machine Factory, etc., despite the heavy tasks of their own factories, still spared manpower to cooperate with Wuhan General Second Factory in milling teeth, so that the task of five sets of blast furnaces was completed on time.

Tianjin comprehensively arranges and gives full play to its strengths

Our newspaper, Tianjin, 10th: Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industry is actively planning the electrical and electrical matching work for rolling, power station, machine tool, mining, and transportation equipment. This work is carried out according to the principle of "cooperation does not move, preserving the old and increasing the new, combining characteristics, comprehensively arranging, supplementing the series, eliminating white spots, and ensuring complete sets."

The supply of complete sets of rolling, power station, machine tool, mining, and transportation equipment is the focus of production in Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industry this year. The main key is the production of complete sets of motor and electrical products. In order to find out the bottom line, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry, since mid-December last year, under the leadership and participation of relevant units of the central government and Hebei Province, together with the industrial bureaus of Tianjin City, the Handicraft Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, universities and other relevant units, on the one hand, investigated the production status of all electrical product factories in the city and collected production data from nine systems and 125 units; At the same time, an investigation was also conducted on what kind and how many kinds of electrical and motor equipment are necessary for the production of five types of equipment. After more than half a month of efforts, they have collected relevant data on 132 kinds of electrical and motor products, and basically figured out what Tianjin can do and what it needs. After sorting out, studying and analyzing various data, combined with this year's production plan, a preliminary plan for the production of complete sets of motors and electrical appliances has been drawn up. To give play to the characteristics of each factory, eliminate duplicate production, and organize complete set factories and original parts factories, etc., to ensure the completion of the series and achieve the purpose of complete supply. If this preliminary plan can be realized, it can make the completion rate of Tianjin's mechanical and electrical industrial products reach 90%, and the five types of equipment can basically be produced in complete sets.

The matching of mechanical and electrical products is a very complex production, technical and organizational work. To this end, relevant departments of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee are preparing to organize a city-wide unified organization to lead, inspect, supervise and promote complete sets of production, and carry out city-wide large-scale cooperation to give full play to the role of Tianjin's industrial base. With the strong support of the Complete Set Research Institute, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering is preparing to organize an exhibition of electrical and motor samples, training classes, and adjust mechanical equipment, factory buildings and other activities to train technical forces and strive to solve the difficulties of weak technical forces, lack of equipment, and insufficient factory buildings. At present, some factories have started complete sets of production activities, some are collecting and sorting out technical data, and some have started the trial production of supporting new products.

Shanghai urgently arranges and delivers goods within a time limit

Our newspaper, Shanghai, 10th: The Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission and relevant industrial departments have formed a special working group to inspect, study and rationally arrange the problems of organizing complete sets of production and complete sets of supply of machinery and electrical products. In the four days since January 6, they have basically figured out the situation and problems in organizing the production of complete sets of smelting equipment and power station equipment last year, and have taken emergency measures for the few auxiliary machines and parts that were planned to be produced last year but have not yet been delivered, and arranged production as soon as possible, and completed the delivery within a time limit.

In order to complete a large number of urgent complete sets of equipment tasks, Shanghai, under the guidance of the idea of ​​the whole country as one, has formed a command for the production of steelmaking and smelting equipment, arranging in complete sets and comprehensively. Thanks to the above measures, most of the smelting equipment and power station equipment manufactured last year have been put into production.

Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industry manufactured a large number of complete sets of smelting equipment and power station equipment last year, which was basically rushed to manufacture in the second half of the year. Due to the increasing tasks and the urgent time, limited raw materials and equipment capacity, a few auxiliary machines and parts in last year's plan could not be delivered in time. The Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission has made emergency arrangements to arrange relevant factories to manufacture them with priority, and they should be fully equipped in January and February, and at the latest in March, to ensure that these complete sets of equipment can be put into production. As for the raw materials needed to manufacture these products, they should be equipped with priority.

Now, the working group is continuing to study the experience and problems of Shanghai's organization of complete sets of equipment production last year, so as to arrange the complete sets of production of smelting equipment, mining equipment, and power station equipment this year more reasonably and more harmoniously.

    实现今年工业战线更大跃进的重要措施
    通力协作大造成套设备
    机械工业部门力争电站冶金等设备按期成套供应用户
    新华社10日讯　按照有计划按比例发展法则的要求，我国机械工业部门今年一开始就极大地注意了加强设备的配套工作。第一机械工业部在国务院指示和各企业督促下已经采取了一系列的重要措施，力争做到在新的一年里，使他们生产的重要设备特别是电站、冶金等设备，都能按期成套地供应给用户，尽快地发挥设备的作用。
    为了满足国民经济各部门的需要，今年我国机械工业将以更高的速度向前发展，电站、冶金、化工、煤炭等重要设备的产量，都将有很大的增长。这些设备不仅数量大，而且组成也极复杂，常常需要几十个以至更多一些的工厂同时协作生产，才能成套地制成和安装起来进行生产。因此，合理安排各机械企业的生产，大力组织设备的配套，是今年机械工业部门进一步提高制造水平、满足工农业生产需要的一项十分重要的任务。
    第一机械工业部加强配套工作的措施，首先是从生产计划上和材料的调拨上来加以平衡。重要的设备如电站设备和轧钢机等，不仅安排了主机的生产计划，同时也具体安排了辅助设备和协作产品的生产；不仅保证主机的材料供应，对于辅助设备的材料供应也都做了安排。对原订的设备生产不成套的环节，现在正在进行适当的调整。为了加强配套工作的检查，国家基本建设委员会、国家经济委员会、第一机械工业部、冶金工业部、水利电力部等部门还联合组成了六个检查组，分赴各地进行工作。
    建立配套的管理机构，是保证配套工作顺利进行的另一重要措施。第一机械工业部已以这个部的生产调度局为基础组成了机电设备成套总公司，另在上海、哈尔滨、天津、西安、重庆、汉口、广州、沈阳、太原等地，分别设立成套公司和分公司。各级成套公司的主要任务是：根据设备配套范围，编制年度和季度的设备配套计划；根据国家安排的计划，同生产工厂和使用单位签订合同，负责供应成套设备。
    在1958年大跃进中，过去专门生产配件、辅机的工厂有的改为生产主要设备，工业企业实现多种经营，这是工业发展中的好现象。但是，由于新的生产配件、辅机的工厂还未相应地发展起来，因此出现了某些主机、辅机特别是维修之间脱节的现象。这对保证设备成套是个很大的问题。为了改变这种情况，第一机械工业部正在拟订具体办法，争取迅速增加配件、辅机的生产能力，并调整一些企业兼任或专任一部分维修任务，以便解决这一薄弱环节。
    设备配套是一个极其重要极其复杂的工作，不仅要求机械工业内部加强协作，同时也需要生产设备的单位和使用设备的单位共同努力，才能真正达到设备安装起来就能用以生产的目的。为此，第一机械工业部除了决定进一步加强同各个单位协作外，并正会同有关部门着手编制“机电设备成套范围手册”，通过这一措施来划定范围，分工负责，共同做好重要设备的成套工作。哈　尔　滨充分发挥现代化厂作用
    本报哈尔滨10日电　哈尔滨市组织全市机械、电机工业大协作，全力以赴地加速完成二十一万瓩的全套电站设备和十二套中型钢铁厂的高炉、电炉和轧钢设备。
    哈尔滨市在承制这批配套的冶金、电站设备中，除充分发挥了第一个五年计划期间新建设起来的电机厂、电表仪器厂、锅炉厂和汽轮机厂等大型现代化机械厂的作用，制造大型主机和特殊配件外，还充分发挥了机联机械厂、群力机械厂等四十多个地方机械工厂的生产能力，他们没有大机床、大吊车，就制造了一千二百多台土机床、积木机床，用小机床干大活，冒着零下三十多度的严寒在露天加工这些大型成套设备的主机和配件。哈尔滨市在组织制造这批成套设备中还积极发挥了高等学校和手工业合作社的特长，如电站设备需要的精密的自动报信号、自动记录热功仪表、电子仪表，都是由哈尔滨工业大学仪表厂和手工业合作社升格的龙江仪表厂试制成功的。这个仪表厂已经能够制造出电阻温度计、电子电位计等高级仪表。
    哈尔滨市在去年9月组织生产的全套电站和冶炼设备部件，目前已经陆续出厂运往广西、云南等国家新建钢铁、电站基地，其中十二套二百五十五立方公尺高炉在1月间即可全部运出，十一套四百公厘轧钢机组也可在第一季度全部配齐。二十一万瓩电站设备目前完成了七万多瓩的主机设备任务。
    哈尔滨市最近还联合组织了检查组，深入检查重点建设项目和生产单位的成套设备供应和生产情况，并进行了必要调配和解决成套漏项的生产组织工作，使成套设备早日成套，使重点建设项目迅速投入生产。重　庆统筹规划　自力更生
    本报重庆10日电　重庆机械工业部门千方百计自力更生解决机械配套问题。
    重庆市今年年初，在安排主机生产任务的同时，就相应地安排了配套机械生产的任务。同时还在去年许多工厂临时突击生产电气设备等配套任务的基础上，进一步做了统筹规划与分工。重庆市原来生产机械配套设备的工厂极少，去年第四季度因机械生产任务重，全市各机械厂不分大小都担任了试制与生产机械配套产品的部分任务，但仍属临时性任务多，根据配套的先后需要来有步骤的生产还不够。今年一开头，就注意了改变这种情况，许多厂都做了比较适当的安排和合理分工以及较长远的规划。如原来只要是电气开关都生产的重庆电气开关厂，今年就规划成只承担生产高压电气开关的任务，低压电气开关就交给区属开关厂去生产。原来有什么就生产什么的重庆仪表厂，现在已规划成为生产热力仪表和电气仪表的专业厂。发电机、电动机、变压器等也都按各厂的生产能力分担生产不同型号和容量的产品。这样，各个厂在人材培养、生产设备等方面都能够有长远的打算，提高产品的质量和数量也更有保证。同时还加强了新产品的试制工作。
    为了克服原材料不足的困难和加快机械配套生产的速度，市机械工业部门加强了技术设计的改革工作。组织了各单位有关的工程技术人员成立产品结构简化设计小组，对配套产品通过试验研究，在保证质量的情况下进行必要的简化和省掉。这样生产成套电气设备的时间和使用原材料都做到大大节约。所有简化了的产品设计经过有关部门仔细审查以后，目前也都先后投入了生产。武　汉先人后己　及时供应
    本报武汉10日电  武汉市机电工业企业的职工，在最近三四个月中，大搞协作，生产成套设备，使国家建设进度加快。他们生产的成套的高炉设备，已在湖北钢厂、汉阳钢厂、扬子钢厂等陆续安装。有些还没有成套的如轧钢机等设备，目前也大力赶制，总装成套的产品和部件。
    过去小型的单一生产的武汉机电工业，由于过去一年来广大职工发挥革命干劲，现在已能生产出大型的成套产品。从去年初到目前为止，成套的设备计有八十三点五立方公尺、五十五立方公尺和二十八立方公尺的高炉三十套，零点五吨的转炉一百五十套，一点五吨转炉两套，此外，还生产了250×3和300×5的轧钢机九台、鼓风机两千多台、电动机五千多台和球磨机、破碎机、空气压缩机等。许多成套的产品，几乎都是在去年第四季度生产出来的。
    大搞协作是武汉市搞机械配套的一项重要办法。早在去年6月，武汉市就召开了全市的协作会议；以后，又陆续召开各种会议，从思想上解决了某些单位存在的怕麻烦、怕吃亏等本位主义思想。随着思想问题的逐步解决，按成套组成的协作体系，也渐渐形成。在专门的协作会议上，有关协作厂矿，都明确了协作任务，并且把这种任务，列入本厂的生产计划之内。许多工厂，在生产协作中，出现了先人后己、主动积极的范例。武汉铸造厂去年11月间为武汉机械厂承担冶金设计铸件的协作，就具有这种先人后己的精神。他们作模型，修改设计，督促甲方提货，大大加快了武汉机械厂的总装进度。铸件供应是高炉配套重要关键，这个厂的职工，提出了保证“什么时候要，什么时候供应”。武汉通用二厂承制五套二十八立方公尺高炉设备的时候，对铣齿一筹莫展，这时，武汉机床厂、汉阳机器厂等尽管本厂任务繁重，还是抽出力量为武汉通用二厂协作铣齿，使五套高炉任务按时完成。天　津全面安排　发挥特长
    本报天津10日电　天津市机电工业正在积极规划轧钢、电站、机床、矿山、交通运输设备方面的电机、电器配套工作。这个工作是根据“协作不动、保旧增新、结合特点、全面安排、补齐系列、消灭白点、保证成套”的原则进行的。
    轧钢、电站、机床、矿山、交通运输设备的成套性的供应，是今年天津市机电工业的生产重点，其中的主要关键，是电机、电器产品的成套性的生产。为了摸清家底，天津市机电工业局自去年12月中旬以来，在中央和河北省有关单位的领导和参加下，会同天津市各工业局以及手工业局，公用局、大专学校等有关单位，一方面调查了全市所有电工产品工厂的生产状况，搜集了九个系统、一百二十五个单位的生产情况资料；同时对生产五种设备所必需具有的甚么样、多少种的电器、电机设备也进行了调查。经过半个多月的努力，他们已经搜集了一百三十二种电器、电机产品的有关资料，基本上摸清了天津做能什么、需要什么的情况。经过对各种资料的整理、研究和分析，结合今年度的生产计划，初步订出了电机、电器成套生产的规划。以发挥各厂特点，消灭重复生产，组织起成套厂亦原件厂等、来保证补齐系列，达到成套供应的目的。这个初步的规划，如能实现，可使天津机电工业产品的成套率达到90％，五种设备，基本上可以成套生产。
    机电产品的配套，是一件十分复杂的生产、技术和组织工作。为此，天津市委有关方面，正准备组织一个全市性的统一组织来领导检查督促成套性的生产，开展全市性的大协作，以充分发挥天津工业基地的作用。天津市机电局在成套研究所的大力支持下，正在准备组织电器、电机样品展览会、训练班，调整机械设备、厂房等活动，来培训技术力量和力争解决技术力量薄弱、设备缺乏、厂房不够等困难。目前有些工厂已开始了成套性生产的活动，有的在收集与整理技术资料，有的已开始了配套的新产品的试制工作。上　海紧急布置　限期交货
    本报上海10日电　上海市计划委员会和有关工业部门已经组成专门的工作组，对机械、电机产品组织成套生产、成套供应的问题进行检查、研究和合理安排。从1月6日以来的四天中，已经基本上摸清了去年组织生产成套冶炼设备和电站设备中的情况和问题，并对去年计划生产而尚未交货的少数辅机和配件，采取紧急措施，尽先布置生产，限期完成交货。
    为了完成大量紧迫的成套设备任务，上海市在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，组成了炼钢和冶炼设备生产指挥部，成套布置、全面安排。由于采取以上措施，去年制造的冶炼设备和电站设备大多已能投入生产。
    上海机电工业去年制造大批成套冶炼设备和电站设备，基本上是在下半年内赶制的。由于任务一再增大，加以时间紧迫，原材料和设备能力有限，因此去年计划中的少数辅机、配件未能及时交货。上海市计委已作了紧急安排，布置有关工厂优先制造，在1、2月份，至迟3月份要配备齐全，保证这些成套设备能够投入生产。至于制造这些产品所需要的原材料要优先配备。
    现在，工作组还继续在研究去年上海市组织成套设备生产的经验和问题，以便更合理地更协调地安排今年冶炼设备、矿山设备、电站设备成套生产问题。（附图片）
