    Loves to Read Articles Reflecting the Tradition of Hard Struggle and Plain Living
    I most like to read articles describing the spirit of hard struggle and plain living in the revolutionary struggle. At present, some people have somewhat forgotten the tradition of hard struggle and plain living because of the great achievements in production and construction. Publishing such articles can inspire everyone to understand diligence and thrift better, which is of great educational significance to both cadres and the masses.

    爱读表现艰苦朴素传统的文章
    我最喜欢读描写革命斗争中艰苦朴素作风的文章。目前有些人因为生产建设的成就大，对艰苦朴素的传统有点忘怀。发表这样的文章，能够启发大家更懂得勤俭，对干部和群众都很有教育意义。
