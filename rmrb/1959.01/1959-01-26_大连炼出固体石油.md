Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian Electric Dispatch. Workers and technicians in the lubricating oil workshop of the Dalian Petroleum Plant No. 7 have closely cooperated and recently successfully trial-produced solid petroleum.

Solid petroleum is a general term for solid crude oil, solid lubricating oil, solid diesel, and solid gasoline. The successful trial production of solid petroleum has created favorable conditions for the transportation and storage of petroleum. Transporting solid petroleum can not only greatly reduce the loss of light oil but also improve transportation efficiency. Solid petroleum is not prone to explosion, and storage does not require oil tanks or very strict warehouses.

    大连炼出固体石油
    新华社旅大电　大连石油七厂润滑油车间的工人和技术人员密切合作，最近试制成功了固体石油。
    固体石油是固体原油、固体润滑油、固体柴油和固体汽油的总称。固体石油试制成功后，对石油的运输、储存创造了良好的条件。运输固体石油，不仅可以大大减少轻质油的损耗，而且可以提高运输效率。固体石油不易爆炸，储存也不需要油罐和十分严密的仓库。
