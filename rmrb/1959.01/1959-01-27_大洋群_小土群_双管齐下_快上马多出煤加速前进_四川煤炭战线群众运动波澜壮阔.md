Chengdu, January 26th (This newspaper) - The coal industry system in Sichuan Province launched an even more magnificent mass movement at the beginning of this year than last year. Coal miners throughout the province are rising up to catch up, striving to get projects started quickly, increase coal production, and move ahead of other industrial sectors to better support the great leap forward in production and construction.

The characteristic of the mass movement on the coal industry front in Sichuan Province this year is the simultaneous use of "large foreign groups" and "small native groups." Production, construction, and technical transformation of small coal mines are all centered on increasing coal production, striving for an all-around great leap forward. The province's coal and coke production this year will greatly exceed any previous year, and the total construction capacity of mines started is more than the total of the construction capacity started since 1953. In the first quarter alone, there are more than sixty major projects under construction, and the production capacity of large and medium-sized mines put into production is equivalent to four times the production capacity of similar mines put into production throughout last year. Technical transformation of small coal mines has been widely launched, with plans to transform more than seven thousand throughout the year.

In 1958, the mass campaign to develop industry with steel as the center brought about tremendous changes in the coal industry in Sichuan Province. Coal production increased from 7.79 million tons in 1957 to 22.3 million tons, and coke production increased threefold. Millions of people went into the mountains to mine coal, and in one year, more than 30,000 small coal mines and more than 20,000 coal and coke kilns were developed. The northern and western Sichuan areas, which were previously thought to have no coal or limited coal resources, also discovered a large number of new coal resources last year. The construction of several new coal bases and a large number of small coal mines has begun to change the situation in Sichuan Province, where the coal industry was concentrated only in a few bases near Chongqing. This year, the all-around great leap forward in production and construction in the province has increased the demand for coal, especially coking coal, coupled with the difficulty of long-distance transportation due to uneven regional distribution, which forces the coal industry to accelerate the leap forward at a faster pace. According to the characteristics of Sichuan Province, where large coalfields are concentrated in a few areas, small and medium-sized coalfields are scattered, and a large number of small coal mines have been built, this year, various localities are adopting a method of combining large, medium, and small bases, striving to build a provincial coal industry base network at the fastest speed, and correspondingly develop the coking industry and improve transportation conditions.

At the beginning of the New Year, coal miners in Sichuan Province are in high spirits. Due to the large-scale mass movement in January, coal and coke production increased rapidly, and raw coal production in the first ten days of January reached 1.12 million tons. Calculated on the basis of average daily output, the first ten days of January have exceeded the average daily output of last year by more than 70%. The miners are continuing to fight to overfulfill the plan for the first quarter.

The construction of coal bases in various regions first pays attention to meeting the needs of steel production. In the Zhongliangshan and Nantong mining areas of Chongqing, the new construction projects of four pairs of large and medium-sized mines have entered the final stage. After these mines are put into production, the coal used by Chongqing's iron and steel industry can be basically satisfied. While constructing large-scale modern washing and screening projects, the Zhongliangshan mining area and the Yongrong mining area have built a number of small and medium-sized native-foreign combined washing and screening plants in advance, catching up with the requirements of mine production.

Among the seven thousand small coal mines planned for technical transformation this year in the province, two thousand will be重点改造（重点改造 = key / focused transformation） to increase the annual production capacity of each to more than 10,000 tons. After the mass technical transformation of thirty-six small coal mines in the Fuling area, the annual production capacity of raw coal increased by 550,000 tons. The Wanjiapu Coal Mine in this area was originally a small coal mine with a daily output of only fifteen tons. The masses made their own set of bamboo and wood structures and equipment, brushed large roadways, improved coal mining methods and ventilation conditions, and the daily output of raw coal increased to about 500 tons.

In order to speed up the construction, the basic construction workers boldly adopted the "single pole derrick large reversal one-time vertical method" to erect the headframe; the metal headframe with a total weight of 75 tons and a total height of 32 meters was erected in 12 hours.

    “大洋群”“小土群”双管齐下　快上马多出煤加速前进
    四川煤炭战线群众运动波澜壮阔
    本报成都26日电　四川省煤炭工业系统今年一开始就开展了一个比去年规模更为壮阔的群众运动。全省煤矿工人奋起直追，力争快上马，多出煤，赶到其他工业部门前头，更好地支持生产建设大跃进。
    四川省今年煤炭工业战线上群众运动的特点，是“大洋群”和“小土群”双管齐下，生产、建设和小煤窑的技术改造都以增产煤炭为中心，争取全面大跃进。今年全省煤、焦产量将大大超过以往任何一年，矿井建设开工的总能力比1953年以来开工能力的总和还多。仅第一季度施工的主要工程就有六十多项，投入生产的大中型矿井，相当于去年全年投入生产的同类型矿井生产能力的四倍。小煤窑的技术改造工作已普遍展开，全年计划改造七千个以上。
    1958年，以钢铁为中心的全民大办工业运动，使四川省煤炭工业面貌发生了巨大变化。煤炭产量从1957年的七百七十九万吨增加到二千二百三十万吨，焦煤产量增加了两倍。千百万人上山采煤，一年之中小煤窑就发展到三万多个，煤焦窑发展到二万多个。原来认为无煤或煤源不多的川北、川西地区，去年也发现了大量新煤源。若干新煤炭基地和大批小煤窑的兴建，开始改变了四川省煤炭工业只集中在重庆附近少数基地的状况。今年全省生产建设全面大跃进，对煤炭、特别是焦煤的需要量增加了，加以地区分布不平衡带来了长途运输的困难，这就迫使煤炭工业必须快马加鞭加速跃进。根据四川省大煤田集中在少数地区，中小煤田分散，小煤窑已大量兴建起来的特点，今年各地除大力提高现有矿井生产能力外，正采取大中小型基地结合的办法，争取以最快的速度建成全省煤炭工业基地网，并相应地发展炼焦工业和改善交通运输条件。
    新年开始，四川省煤矿工人斗志昂扬。1月份由于大搞群众运动，煤、焦产量迅速上升，1月上旬原煤产量达到一百一十二万吨。按平均日产量计算，1月上旬已经超过去年平均日产量70％以上。矿工们正为超额完成第一季度的计划继续奋战。
    各地煤炭基地的建设首先注意满足钢铁生产的需要。重庆中梁山和南桐矿区有四对大型和中型矿井的新建工程已经进入收尾阶段。这批矿井投入生产以后，重庆钢铁工业用煤就可以基本上得到满足。中梁山矿区和永荣矿区在建设大型现代化洗选工程的同时，已经提前建成一批中小型土洋结合的小型洗选厂，迎头赶上矿井生产的要求。
    全省计划今年进行技术改造的七千个小煤窑中，将重点改造二千个，使每个年产能力达到一万吨以上。涪陵专区有三十六个小煤窑经过群众性的技术改造以后，原煤年产能力增加了五十五万吨。这个专区的万家堡煤矿原来是一个日产量只有十五吨的小煤窑，群众自己动手制成了一套竹木结构的土设备，刷大巷道，改进采煤方法和通风情况，原煤日产量增加到五百吨左右。　（吕希林）（附图片）
    南桐煤矿是四川省正在扩建中的最大炼焦煤基地。基本建设职工为了加速建设速度，大胆采用“单扒杆大反转一次竖立法”架设井架；将总重七十五吨、全高三十二公尺的金属井架在十二小时内就架设完工。这是起吊时情景。　（四川省煤炭工业厅稿）
