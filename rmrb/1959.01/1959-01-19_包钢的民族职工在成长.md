At a bustling late night, I visited the home of a young Mongol-Han married couple. It was a happy family. The husband was Mongolian, the wife was Han, and they had a chubby baby.

Baogang—one of China's three major iron and steel bases—besides its important significance in China's iron and steel industry, it is also a model of the leap forward of China's minority nationalities with the help of the Han elder brothers, and a symbol of the close unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in China!

For us Mongolians, Baogang marks the beginning of our nation's transition from nomadic life to the age of iron and steel, and marks the emergence of our nation's steelworkers and the growth of the working class.

From the day it began planning, Baogang fully recognized the importance of cultivating ethnic minority workers. The Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made a special resolution on this. When Baotou was liberated in 1949, there were only about two hundred Mongol residents in the city, and none of them worked in modern enterprises. By the end of last year, there were nearly 1,400 Mongolian workers in Baotou. Facts have proved that this is a glorious victory for the Party's ethnic policy in Baotou. As early as 1952, when the 241 Exploration Team began surveying the Baiyun'ebo mine, it recruited Mongolian youths to participate in the work. Since then, thousands of Mongolian youths have come from the grasslands and villages of Inner Mongolia, putting down their lassoes and hoes, and throwing themselves into the construction of Baogang. Now, we can see Mongolian workers operating electric shovels on the majestic Baiyun'ebo Mountain, loading mountains of ore onto trucks; in the workshop of the General Machinery Factory, Mongolian apprentices are standing beside lathes, humbly learning from their Han elder brothers...

In Baogang, not only are there thousands of Mongolian workers, but also in the management departments at all levels of the enterprise, Mongolian comrades are holding various leadership positions. Comrade Ulji Naren, Deputy General Manager of Baogang Corporation, is always filled with pride when talking about Baogang. He said: "After Baogang is completed, we will be able to compete with advanced regions!"

A Mongolian leader of the Baiyun'ebo Mining Company said: "In the past, the 'iron and steel industry' that we Mongolians knew was only horseshoeing, but now we are running a real iron and steel industry and building a world-class iron and steel base!"

In the socialist family of the motherland where all nationalities are equal and cooperate, the Mongolian workers of Baogang are closely united with their Han elder brothers, contributing all their strength to the common and heroic cause, and to the early completion of the Baotou Iron and Steel Base!

Baogang will always be as the Mongolian herdsmen call it—"Manai" (Mongolian, meaning "ours") Baogang!

    包钢的民族职工在成长
    玛拉沁夫
    在一个沸腾的深夜，我到一个蒙汉合婚的青年工人家里去作客。那是一个幸福的家庭。丈夫是蒙族，妻子是汉族，生了一个白胖胖的孩子。
    包钢——我国三大钢铁基地之一，它除在我国钢铁工业上所占有的重要意义之外，它又是我国少数民族在汉族老大哥的帮助下飞跃前进的榜样，是我国各兄弟民族紧密团结、合作的象征！
    对我们蒙古民族来说，包钢标志着我们民族从游牧生活，开始跨进钢铁的时代，标志着我们民族的钢铁工人的出现和工人阶级的成长。
    包钢，从它开始筹划那一天起，就充分注意到培养民族职工的重要意义。中共包头市委为此曾作过专门性决议。当1949年包头解放的时候，市内的蒙族全部居民才不过二百人左右，而且是没有人在现代企业中工作的。去年年底包头市的蒙族职工已近一千四百人。事实证明了这是党的民族政策在包头得到了辉煌的胜利。远在1952年，二四一勘探队开始勘测白云鄂博矿山时，就吸收蒙族青年参加了工作。从那时起，千百个蒙族青年，从内蒙古的草原和村庄，放下套马杆和锄头，前来投入包钢建设之中。现在，我们在雄伟的白云鄂博山上可以看到蒙族工人开动电铲，把如山似海的矿石装上车去；在机械总厂车间里蒙族徒工站在车床旁，向汉族老大哥在虚心学习……。
    在包钢，不但有千百个蒙族工人，而且在各级企业管理部门中，蒙族同志也都担任着各种不同的领导工作。包钢总公司副总经理乌力吉那仁同志每当谈到包钢的时候，是那样充满自豪的感情。他说：“包钢建成后，我们这里就可以与先进的地区相媲美了！”
    白云鄂博矿山公司一位蒙族领导同志说：“从前咱们蒙古人所知道的‘钢铁工业’就是挂马掌，可是现在我们办起真正的钢铁工业，而且在建设世界上第一流的钢铁基地！”
    在祖国社会主义平等合作的各民族大家庭里，包钢蒙族职工，与汉族老大哥紧密团结，为了共同豪迈的事业，为了早日建成包头钢铁基地，他们贡献着自己所有的力量！
    包钢永远是如蒙族牧民所称那样——“玛纳依”（蒙语，意思是“我们的”）包钢！（附图片）
