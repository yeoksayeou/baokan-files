Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: TASS, Moscow: The Soviet government on January 10th sent a note to the government of the German Democratic Republic, proposing to convene a peace conference in Warsaw or Prague within two months to study the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union, and to formulate and sign a mutually agreed-upon treaty.

The Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Belyayev, visited the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Ulbricht, on January 10th and personally handed him the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and the relevant note from the Soviet government to the government of the German Democratic Republic.

The note emphasized that the resurgence of German militarism in the Federal Republic of Germany, taking advantage of the absence of a signed peace treaty, cannot but cause unease to the Soviet people and other European people who have repeatedly suffered heavy disasters and hardships brought about by militarist Germany.

The note pointed out how acute and profound the absence of a peace treaty and its resulting consequences are for the German people. Due to the absence of a peace treaty with Germany, the situation in Europe is seriously complicated, causing suspicion and distrust in relations between countries, and hindering the normalization of these relations.

The note pointed out that the Soviet government highly appreciates the efforts made by the government of the German Democratic Republic over the years to accelerate the drafting and signing of a German peace treaty. These efforts have been consistently sympathized with and actively supported by the Soviet side. The Soviet government believes that signing a peace treaty now is precisely the fastest way for the German people to solve their primary national task – restoring national unification. The Soviet government believes that the treaty will lay a good foundation for the rapprochement of the two Germanys and for overcoming the deep differences of opinion that still hinder unification.

The Soviet government, in submitting the draft treaty to the government of the German Democratic Republic for study, emphasized that the foundation of this draft is to enable Germany to achieve peaceful and democratic development.

The note stated that the Soviet government believes that the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have the right to reach an agreement on any due representation of Germany in the drafting and signing of the treaty.

The note stated that the Soviet government believes that for the German Democratic Republic, the treaty will record and internationally affirm the results that have been effectively achieved through the thorough implementation of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement.

The note emphasized that, because the German Democratic Republic has carried out fundamental democratic and social reforms, it has been able to firmly embark on the path of peaceful development and has become a major factor in ensuring lasting peace in Europe.

The Soviet note pointed out that all domestic and foreign policies of the government of the German Democratic Republic are in line with the vital interests of the German people and have established friendly relations with other countries. The note stated that Germany's neighbors, who have more than once been the target of devastating wars launched by German imperialism in the past, now have such a loyal friend and unwavering fighter for European peace as the German Democratic Republic.

The note concluded by saying that the Soviet government hopes that the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the draft peace treaty with Germany can receive the support of the government of the German Democratic Republic, and make every effort to ensure that the peace conference can successfully complete its important task.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, 11th dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Moscow, Mr. Kroll, on January 10th and handed him the draft peace treaty with Germany and the relevant note from the Soviet government to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The note emphasized: "It should be pointed out that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany should bear a large part of the responsibility for the current situation in Germany, including the fact that Germany still does not have a treaty, because it has adopted a policy of reviving militarism and closely linked its policies with the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc, which fundamentally violates the national interests of Germany. The reply of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on January 5, 1959, to the Soviet government's note of November 27, 1958, on the Berlin issue is proof of this. This note shows that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is not assisting in resolving the Berlin issue in a way that benefits European peace and the German nation, but is instead trying to stir up frenzy and aggravate the situation around the Berlin issue in order to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin."

The note stated that it is noteworthy that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany can no longer deny the necessity of immediately preparing a peaceful settlement of the German issue, even though its note of November 17, 1958, showed that it had not abandoned its attempts to belittle the significance of this important issue and put it in a secondary position. In both Germanys, the movement to expedite the drafting and conclusion of a treaty is expanding, and therefore, this position of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is even more unjustified. The note stated that, in order to place the cause of peaceful settlement of the German issue on a practical basis, the Soviet Union has therefore drafted a treaty and submitted it to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany for study. The Soviet Union's draft peace treaty with Germany guarantees fair treatment of the legitimate interests of the German people. This draft is fundamentally different from the Treaty of Versailles, which was a treaty imposed by imperialism on defeated Germany, placing Germany in a subordinate position and restricting its sovereignty.

The note stated that the Soviet government proposes to convene a peace conference in Warsaw or Prague within a period of two months to discuss the proposed draft peace treaty with Germany, to draft and sign mutually agreed-upon provisions, and the governments of the two Germanys will sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. If a German Confederation has been established by the time the treaty is signed, then the treaty can be signed by the German Confederation as well as representatives of the two Germanys. If Western countries consider it appropriate to exchange views with the Soviet Union on the content of the treaty in advance of the convening of the peace conference, the Soviet government will agree to do so. In this case, it must be guaranteed that the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, the two countries directly related to the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany, participate accordingly.

The note stated that the Soviet government hopes that the proposals it has put forward and the attached draft peace treaty with Germany will receive the support of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, and that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany cannot stand idly by in resolving issues involving the vital interests of the German people. The Soviet Union hopes that the Federal Government will promptly present its views on the draft treaty and participate appropriately in the discussion of this draft at the peace conference.

    苏联照会民主德国和西德政府
    从速缔结和约符合德国民族利益
    希望两个德国政府支持苏联建议促成和会召开
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在1月10日照会德意志民主共和国政府，建议在两个月内在华沙或布拉格召开和平会议，研究苏联提出的对德和约草案，并且拟定和签订大家同意的和约。
    苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使别尔乌辛于1月10日拜访了德意志民主共和国部长会议第一副总理乌布利希，并且亲自把苏联对德和约草案和苏联政府给德意志民主共和国政府的有关照会交给他。
    照会强调指出，德国军国主义利用没有签订和约的情况，重新在德意志联邦共和国抬头得势，这不能不使苏联人民和其他曾经多次受到军国主义德国所带来的沉重灾害和苦难的欧洲人民感到不安。
    照会指出，没有和约和由此而产生的后果，对于德国人民来说是多么尖锐和深刻。由于没有对德和约，使欧洲的局势严重地复杂化，引起各国关系中的怀疑和不信任，妨碍这些关系的正常化。
    照会指出，苏联政府对德意志民主共和国政府多年来在加速草拟和签订德国和约方面所作的努力给予极高的评价。这些努力受到苏联方面一贯的同情和积极的支持。苏联政府认为，现在签订和约，正是尽快使德国人民解决他们主要的全民族的任务——恢复国家的统一。苏联政府认为，和约将为两个德国的接近，为克服那种至今阻挠统一的深刻的意见分歧建立良好基础。
    苏联政府把和约草案送交德意志民主共和国政府研究时强调指出，这个草案的基础是使德国得到和平民主的发展。
    照会说，苏联政府认为，德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府有权就拟定和签订和约时德国的任何应有的代表权问题达成协议。
    照会说，苏联政府认为，对德意志民主共和国来说，和约将是把由于彻底贯彻波茨坦协定的原则而事实上已经取得的成果记录下来和在国际法上加以肯定。
    照会强调指出，由于德意志民主共和国进行了根本性的民主改革和社会改革，它已经能够巩固地走上和平发展的道路，并且成为保证欧洲持久和平的重大因素。
    苏联照会中指出，德意志民主共和国政府的一切内政外交政策都符合德国人民的切身利益，并且同其他国家建立了友好关系。照会说，德国的邻国过去不止一次作为德国帝国主义发动毁灭性战争的对象，现在它们有了德意志民主共和国这样一个忠实的朋友和维护欧洲和平的始终不渝的战士。
    照会最后说，苏联政府希望，苏联所提出的建议和对德和约草案能够得到德意志民主共和国政府的支持，并且尽力使和平会议能够胜利地完成它的重要任务。
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯1月10日接见了德意志联邦共和国驻莫斯科大使克罗尔，把对德和约草案和苏联政府给德意志联邦共和国政府的有关照会交给他。
    照会强调说：“应该指出，德意志联邦共和国政府对德国的当前局面，包括德国至今还没有和约一事，应负很大一部分责任，因为它采取了复活军国主义的方针，并且把自己的政策同根本违背德国民族利益的北大西洋公约组织军事集团的计划紧密联系在一起。德意志联邦共和国政府在1959年1月5日答复苏联政府1958年11月27日关于柏林问题的照会的复照，就是证明。这个照会表明，德意志联邦共和国政府不是协助解决柏林问题，以有利于欧洲和平和德意志民族，反而是千方百计地围绕柏林问题煽起狂热和加剧局势，以达到维持西柏林的占领制度的目的。”
    照会说，值得注意的是，最近德意志联邦共和国政府再也不能否认立即准备和平解决德国问题的必要性，尽管它的1958年11月17日的照会表明，它还没有放弃贬低这个重要问题的意义和把它放在次要地位的企图。在两个德国，争取尽快拟订和缔结和约的运动正在扩大，因此，德意志联邦共和国政府的这种立场就更加没有理由了。照会说，为了把和平解决德国问题的事业置于实际的基础上，苏联因此拟订了和约的草案，并将它提交德意志联邦共和国政府研究。苏联拟订的对德和约草案保证公正地对待德国人民的合法利益。这个草案根本不同于凡尔赛和约，凡尔赛和约是帝国主义强迫战败的德国订立的条约，它使德国处于隶属的地位，限制它的主权。
    照会说，苏联政府建议在两个月的期限内，在华沙或布拉格召开和会来讨论拟议中的对德和约草案，草拟和签订一致同意的条文，两个德国的政府将代表德国签订和约。如果在签订和约的时候已经建立了德意志邦联，那么就可以由德意志邦联以及两个德国的代表来签订和约。如果西方国家认为在和会召开以前，事先就和约内容问题同苏联交换意见是适宜的话，苏联政府将同意这样做。在这种情况下，必须保证德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国这两个同缔结对德和约直接有关的国家相应地参加。
    照会说，苏联政府希望，它所提出的建议以及所附的对德和约草案将得到德意志联邦共和国政府的支持，德意志联邦共和国政府不能对解决牵涉到德国人民切身利益的问题袖手旁观。苏联希望联邦政府迅速对和约草案提出自己的看法，并且适当地参加和会上对这个草案的讨论。
