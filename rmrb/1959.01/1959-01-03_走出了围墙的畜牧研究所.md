    Livestock Research Institute Steps Out of the Enclosure
    Wu Xiang
    In mountainous Albania, 30% of the land is natural pasture, with lush grass evergreen throughout the four seasons, like a green carpet. The Albanian people have a tradition of animal husbandry since ancient times, and the income from animal husbandry accounts for one-third of the total income of agriculture and animal husbandry. However, in the decades before liberation, due to the oppression of domestic reactionary rulers and the plunder by German and Italian fascists, Albania's animal husbandry was severely damaged; at the same time, due to primitive management methods, lack of feed, and poor breeds of cattle and sheep, the meat and milk production rates were very low. After liberation, the Albanian Labor Party and the people's regime were very concerned about the development of animal husbandry, and held several special meetings to solve the problems in the development of animal husbandry. Now, in terms of population, Albania ranks first in the Balkan Peninsula in terms of the number of livestock, and third in Europe in terms of the number of sheep. In 1958, there were a total of 414,000 cattle, 1.6 million sheep, and 1.3 million goats, with an average of nearly three people per cow and two sheep per person nationwide. The National Livestock Conference held in Tirana last March called for further measures to increase the number of dairy cows and improve cattle breeds. Last November, the plenary session of the Labor Party Central Committee made a resolution on this, proposing an inspiring indicator, requiring that by 1965, the production of meat and milk would be doubled, that is, meat would increase from 12 kilograms per person per year to 24 kilograms, and milk would increase from 95.5 kilograms per person per year to 191 kilograms. This was originally a figure in the long-term plan for 1975, but the Labor Party Central Committee, based on the practical experience of animal husbandry development in the past few years and the potential that can be tapped, decided to realize it ten years in advance.
    On December 2nd last year, the reporter visited the Livestock Research Institute, which is closely related to the development of animal husbandry throughout Albania.
    The Livestock Research Institute is located in the suburbs of Shkodër, a major animal husbandry area, covering an area of approximately 400 hectares. When the institute began construction in 1947, it was called the Livestock Farm, and its task was to cultivate excellent breeds for supply to all parts of the country. In 1955, the Livestock Farm was reorganized into the Livestock Research Institute, becoming one of the five major institutions of the Albanian Institute of Sciences, with three branches and two stations. While continuing to cultivate excellent breeds, it also engaged in scientific research on urgent issues in animal husbandry. At the same time, a livestock technical secondary school was also moved in, with the deputy director of the institute concurrently serving as the principal. In this way, it also undertook the task of cultivating animal husbandry technical talents. Now, a group of technical personnel has emerged in the institute, including 15 senior technicians, with Soviet livestock breeding expert Che Smirnov serving as a consultant, and is conducting research on eight special topics such as cattle, sheep, feed, and poultry.
    The director of the institute, Dalle Jello, an alternate member of the Labor Party Central Committee, led us to visit the cowshed. The cowshed was neatly cleaned, and calves and cows were separated, with fixed times for feeding, rest, and bathing, so they grow fast, develop well, and do not get sick. An old breeder, Richa Imori, who is forty-eight years old, pointed to the calf and said with a smile: "With such careful care, are you still afraid of not growing well? I have been feeding cattle for fifteen years, and I never thought that cattle needed any life system. Now I understand that there is science in it." Then, we visited the laboratory. Various precision instruments from the Soviet Union and East Germany filled three rooms, which could test milk, wool, and feed.
    Comrade Dalle Jello told us that 1957 was the year when Albania's animal husbandry began to develop greatly, and it was also the year when their work began to deepen. In this year, the Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee specially discussed the issue of improving sheep breeds, convened two national livestock conferences, and also inspected the work of the Livestock Research Institute, affirmed their great achievements, and criticized their shortcomings in not being closely linked with production units, and asked them to step out of the enclosure and go deep into the masses. They earnestly implemented this correct policy of the Party Central Committee, established fixed links with six different types of agricultural cooperatives, and often went deep down to "pilot" projects, helping them to achieve results, establish examples, and then summarize experience and use the method of organizing competitions to promote them throughout the country. Once scientific research stepped out of the enclosure and was combined with labor production, it showed great power. The work of improving breeds with artificial insemination made great progress the year before last, with 395,000 sheep undergoing artificial mating, and it increased to 600,000 last year. The "Qikaia" sheep, which has a high reproduction rate, strong resistance, and high milk production, has basically spread throughout the country. Last year, large-scale artificial mating of cattle breeds was also carried out. It can also overfulfill the plan.
    The next day, the reporter visited the Dobras Agricultural Production Cooperative. This is one of the six agricultural cooperatives with which the Livestock Research Institute has fixed links. This cooperative was established in 1946 and is one of the earliest cooperatives in the Shkodër area. Its work is relatively advanced, and it has received many award banners and certificates. However, this cooperative did not pay enough attention to animal husbandry in the past. For a long period, there was not even a cow in the cooperative. The Livestock Research Institute sent people to help them every now and then, patiently pointing out the losses caused by the one-sidedness of only focusing on agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry. The thinking of the cooperative cadres changed. Now, this cooperative with 117 households has developed 60 high-quality cows and has learned scientific breeding methods such as separating calves from cows and storing green fodder. The annual milk production of each cow increased from more than 800 liters in the past to 1,160 liters the year before last, and then to 1,720 liters last year. After the young members of the cooperative went to the research institute to visit and receive training, they discovered that raising livestock was originally a science with great significance, so they became interested in the work of breeders and milkers. Now there are already six cultured young men among the breeders. A girl named Kamile Draveishi raised all 38 calves she was responsible for last year, exceeding the quota by 18, and was rewarded by the cooperative. The secretary of the agricultural cooperative's party committee, Muham Lan Ge Sanmi, said that the research institute's concern for the livestock in their cooperative is really meticulous. From the director to the general technicians, almost all of them have come to the cooperative. Once the year before last, the cattle suddenly fell ill in the middle of the night, and it was raining heavily, and it was so dark that nothing could be seen. Where could you find a veterinarian at this time? And who would be willing to come? As a result, a phone call was made to the research institute, and the veterinarian crawled out of the warm bed and rushed over in the rain. He also said: "Let's go and see, they are checking our cattle today." Walking to the cowshed, sure enough, the director and the Soviet consultant were there, as well as several technicians, who were teaching the breeders of the agricultural cooperative how to use those inspection instruments. This is an annual health check, and each cow has its own "file." I picked up the registration form and counted, and there were 19 items to be checked. One breeder said excitedly: "Socialism is really good, not only do people live happily, but even cattle are enjoying happiness. In the old society, poor people couldn't afford to hire a doctor when they were sick, and who would be willing to give you such a thorough check when you were not sick?!" Everyone laughed after hearing this.
    This Livestock Research Institute, which has stepped out of the enclosure, has won the love of collective farmers. It will further combine scientific research with labor production and make greater and more contributions in the struggle to develop animal husbandry in Albania. (Attached picture)

    走出了围墙的畜牧研究所
    吴象
    在多山的阿尔巴尼亚，30％的土地是天然牧场，嫩草四季常青，像绿色的地毯一样。阿尔巴尼亚人民自古就有畜牧的传统，畜牧业的收入要占到农牧业总收入的三分之一。但是，解放前数十年由于国内反动统治者的压榨和德、意法西斯的掠夺，阿尔巴尼亚的畜牧业遭到了严重破坏；同时，由于经营方法原始，饲料缺乏，牛、羊的品种不好，出肉率和出乳率都很低。解放后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民政权非常关心畜牧业的发展，曾多次召开专门会议解决发展畜牧业中的问题。现在按人口计算，阿尔巴尼亚的牲畜头数占巴尔干半岛的第一位，绵羊数占欧洲的第三位。1958年共有牛四十一万四千头，绵羊一百六十万只，山羊一百三十万只，全国平均近三个人一头牛，一个人两只羊。去年3月在地拉那举行的全国牲畜会议，要求进一步采取措施增加奶牛头数，改良牛种。去年11月劳动党中央全会又为此作出决议，提出一个令人振奋的指标，要求到1965年，肉和奶的产量翻一番，即肉由每人每年十二公斤提高到二十四公斤，奶由每人每年九十五公斤半提高到一百九十一公斤，这原来是1975年远景计划中的数字，但是劳动党中央根据几年来畜牧业发展的实践经验和可能挖掘的潜力，确定要提前十年来实现它了。
    去年12月2日，记者访问了与阿尔巴尼亚全国畜牧业发展有密切关系的畜牧研究所。
    畜牧研究所设在主要畜牧区斯库台的市郊，占地约四百公顷。研究所1947年开始建设时，叫畜牧饲养场，任务是培养优良品种供应全国各地。1955年，畜牧饲养场改组为畜牧研究所，成为阿尔巴尼亚科学研究所五个主要机构之一，下设三个分所两个站，一面继续培养优良品种，一面从事畜牧业中迫切问题的科学研究。同时，又把一个畜牧技术中学也搬进来，由研究所的副主任兼任校长。这样，它又负担了培养畜牧技术人才的任务。现在研究所已涌现出一批技术力量，其中有高级技术人员十五名，由苏联畜牧饲养专家契·斯米尔诺夫担任顾问，正在进行牛、羊、饲料、家禽等八个专题的研究。
    研究所主任、劳动党候补中央委员达莱·捷洛引导我们去参观牛棚。牛棚收拾得很整洁，小牛与母牛分居，喂奶、休息、洗澡都有固定的时间，因此成长快，发育好，不患病。四十八岁的老饲养员里查·伊莫里指着小牛笑着说：“照顾得这样周到，还怕长不好？我过去喂过十五年的牛，从来没有想到牛还需要什么生活制度，现在才懂得这里面也有科学。”接着，我们又参观了化验室。来自苏联和民主德国的各种精密的仪器，摆满了三间屋子，可以化验奶、毛和饲料。
    达莱·捷洛同志告诉我们，1957年是阿尔巴尼亚畜牧业开始大发展的一年，也是他们工作开始深入的一年。这一年党中央二月全会专题讨论了改良绵羊品种的问题，召开了两次全国性的牲畜会议，也检查了畜牧研究所的工作，肯定了他们的巨大成就，又批评了他们与生产单位联系不紧密的缺点，要他们走出围墙，深入到群众中去。他们认真执行了党中央这个正确的方针，与六个不同类型的农业社建立了固定联系，经常深入下去“试点”，帮助它们做出成绩，树立了榜样，再总结经验用组织竞赛的方法向全国推广。科学研究工作一走出围墙，一与劳动生产相结合，便显示出巨大的威力，前年用人工授精改良品种的工作有很大进展，有三十九万五千只绵羊进行了人工交配，去年更增加到六十万只。繁殖率高、抵抗力强、产奶量大的“齐卡亚”羊基本上已遍及全国。去年又大规模进行牛种人工交配。同样可以超额完成计划。
    第二天，记者又访问了多不拉斯农业生产合作社。这是畜牧研究所固定联系的六个农业社之一。这个社是1946年开始建立的，是斯库台区的最早的一个社，工作比较先进，得的奖旗和奖状很多，但是，这个社过去对畜牧业是不够重视的，在很长的一个期间，社内连一条母牛都没有。畜牧研究所三天两头派人来帮助他们，耐心地指出只抓农业忽视畜牧的片面性所造成的损失。社干部思想转变了，现在，这个一百一十七户的社，优种母牛已发展到六十头，而且学会了小牛与母牛分居及贮青等科学饲养方法。每条母牛每年的产奶量，前年由过去的八百多公升增为一千一百六十公升，去年又增为一千七百二十公升。青年社员到研究所去参观、受训以后，发现饲养牲畜原来是一门有重大意义的学问，于是对饲养员、挤奶员的工作发生了兴趣。现在饲养员中已经有六个有文化的小伙子。一个名叫卡米来·德拉维希的姑娘，去年把她负责饲养的三十八条小牛全部带大了，超过了定额十八条，受到了社的奖励。农业社的党委书记默罕兰姆·格三米说，研究所对他们社里牲畜的关心真是无微不至，从主任到一般技术员差不多都到社里来过。前年有一次半夜里牛得了急病，又下着大雨，天黑得什么也看不见。这时候到哪里去找兽医？找到了谁又肯来？结果呢，一个电话打到研究所，兽医从热被窝里爬出来，冒着雨就赶来了。他又说：“咱们快去看看吧，他们今天正在替我们的牛作检查。”走到牛棚，果然主任、苏联顾问都在，还有几个技术人员，正在教给农业社的饲养员如何使用那些检查仪器。这是一年一度的健康检查，每一只牛都有自己的“档案”。我拿起登记表数了数，检查的项目有十九个。一个饲养员兴奋地说：“社会主义真好，不仅人们生活幸福，连牛也享了福了。旧社会穷人病了还请不起医生，没病时候谁肯给你这么检查来检查去的？！”说得大家都哈哈大笑起来。
    这个走出了围墙的畜牧研究所，已经赢得集体农民的热爱。它将使科学研究与劳动生产进一步结合起来，在阿尔巴尼亚发展畜牧业的斗争中作出更大更多的贡献。（附图片）
