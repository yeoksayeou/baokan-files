The People’s Daily, Nanchang, January 20th: What to do about insufficient labor during winter production? The Hunan People's Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, has fully utilized the superiority of the "big and public" nature of the commune. While strengthening ideological education and raising the awareness of its members, it has improved labor organization and vigorously reformed tools, basically overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor during winter production. Before taking the above measures, it was estimated that the commune would not be able to complete its winter production tasks until the end of April this year. After taking the above measures, production efficiency has increased many times over, and it is expected that all winter production tasks will be completed before the Spring Festival.

Currently, the more than 300 water conservancy projects planned for winter and spring by the Hunan Commune have been basically completed; more than 1 million dan of fertilizer have been applied to the 16,000 mu of overwintering crops throughout the commune, and more than 4,000 field-side manure kilns have been dug throughout the commune, accumulating more than 10 million dan of fertilizer. In addition, sideline production is also booming, with nearly 50% of the income plan already completed. The good winter production has prepared a solid material foundation for realizing a greater leap forward in 1959.

After the Hunan Commune finished the autumn harvest at the end of October last year, it immediately made arrangements for winter production. According to the requirements for a greater leap forward in 1959, it planned to build 300 medium-sized and small reservoirs, basically eliminating drought in the commune in 1959; the amount of fertilizer accumulated and produced would average 1,000 dan per mu of land; and the 16,000 mu of overwintering crops were required to be cultivated and managed well to achieve high yields per mu. In addition, in order to increase the income of commune members and prepare more funds for the spring plowing in 1959, it was planned to carry out large-scale sideline production, striving to achieve an income of 400,000 yuan within three months. After formulating the winter production plan, the commune calculated its labor force and found that it would need 1 million labor days. According to the full and semi-labor force participating in agricultural production throughout the commune, it would take six months, which means it would not be possible to complete the winter production plan until the end of April 1959.

Faced with the difficulty of insufficient labor, there were four opinions among the commune members at that time on how to complete the winter production plan. First, reduce the task; second, produce according to the existing labor force and old methods, completing as much as possible; third, increase labor intensity, work a few more hours each day, and engage in more night battles; fourth, give full play to the superior conditions of the commune being large and public, strengthen ideological education, raise the awareness of the commune members, mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, and at the same time, improve labor organization and vigorously reform tools to improve production efficiency. In response to the above four proposals, the commune Party committee organized all commune members to start a debate. During the debate, many commune members pointed out that the first and second opinions were conservative and passive, and if this was done, the greater leap forward in 1959 could not be realized. At the same time, everyone believed that the third opinion was not a good solution either, and that the way out should not be found by extending working hours and increasing labor intensity. Finally, all commune members agreed with the fourth proposal and unanimously believed that the way to complete the winter production task was: 1. Rationally arrange the labor force, establish a production responsibility system, and improve labor organization; 2. Comprehensively carry out tool reform in various productions such as water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production; 3. Strengthen regular socialist and communist education, and give play to the communist labor spirit of the commune members.

Based on the three methods proposed by all commune members after the debate, the commune Party committee formulated three measures to ensure the completion of the winter production task, which have achieved obvious results in more than two months.

The first measure taken by the Hunan Commune was to improve labor organization. According to the characteristics and needs of various production tasks, the commune made reasonable arrangements for the more than 7,000 laborers in the commune: in addition to extracting 1,250 relatively strong laborers to build water conservancy projects, the remaining 5,000 or so stronger laborers or those with certain production skills and experience were all put into sideline production and fertilizer accumulation, field management, etc. At the same time, the "five-determination" method of fixing people, fixing areas, fixing quantity, fixing quality, and fixing time was adopted to establish a production responsibility system at all levels and assign production responsibilities to commune members; and the levels of labor were adjusted, and the labor force of the commune was divided into five levels, each level having different labor quotas. In this way, it not only gave play to the strengths of each commune member and improved labor efficiency, but also strengthened the commune members' sense of production responsibility and encouraged greater production enthusiasm.

Large-scale tool reform, mobilizing the masses to create and promptly promote new production tools and advanced experience, is the second effective measure taken by the Hunan Commune to solve the problem of insufficient labor. The commune Party committee mobilized all commune members to rush to manufacture 5,000 carts within a month and installed ball bearings on all of them, so that the transportation in various productions such as water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation was realized by carts, basically eliminating the phenomenon of carrying on shoulders. When the largest water conservancy project in the commune, the Satellite Reservoir, started construction, more than 1,800 people worked on it, and they could only complete 1,200 cubic meters of earthwork per day; later, a technical innovation movement was carried out on the construction site, and the masses created more than ten kinds of advanced tools. The number of workers decreased by one-third, but the daily completion of earthwork increased to more than 4,800 cubic meters.

The third measure taken by the Hunan Commune is to strengthen the regular education of its members. The specific methods are: one is to mobilize the masses to carry out self-education and mutual criticism; one is to carry out comparisons and competitions between teams and teams, groups and groups, commune members and commune members, comparing work efficiency, comparing progress, comparing quality, and comparing good ideas; and one is to run schools that combine politics, culture, technology, and sports, and organize all commune members to participate in two hours of study every day. Through competitions and learning, many commune members have learned new production technologies, improved their ideological awareness, consciously abide by labor discipline, and greatly promoted the spirit of communist labor.

Now, some of the winter production tasks of the Hunan People's Commune are nearing completion, and some have been completed ahead of schedule; for weak links, such as fertilizer accumulation, the commune is transferring labor from the completed water conservancy construction sites to carry out shock work.

    临川湖南公社改善劳动组织，大搞工具改革
    劳力问题解决冬季生产活跃
    本报南昌20日电　冬季生产中劳动力不足怎么办？江西省临川县湖南人民公社充分发挥公社一大二公的优越条件，在加强思想教育，提高社员觉悟的同时，一面改善劳动组织，一面大搞工具改革，基本克服了冬季生产中劳力不足的困难。这个公社在没有采取上述措施之前，据计算要到今年4月底才能完成冬季生产任务；采取了上述措施之后，生产效率成倍地提高，预计在春节前便可以全部完成冬季生产任务。
    目前，湖南公社计划冬春完成的三百多座水利工程已经基本完工；全社一万六千亩越冬作物已追施了一百多万担肥料，全社挖了四千多个田头粪窑，积了一千万多担肥料。此外，副业生产也搞得轰轰烈烈，收入计划已完成近50％。由于冬季生产搞得好，为实现1959年更大跃进准备了雄厚的物质基础。
    湖南公社于去年10月底结束秋收后，立即就冬季生产作了安排，根据1959年更大跃进的要求，计划兴修三百座中、小型水库，全社1959年基本消灭旱灾；积肥造肥量，平均每亩田施一千担；对一万六千亩越冬作物要求培育管理好，亩亩高产。另外，为了增加社员的收入和给1959年春耕准备更多的资金，计划大规模开展副业生产，争取在三个月内收入达到四十万元。制订了冬季生产计划后，公社算了一笔劳动力账，需要一百万个劳动日。按全社参加农业生产的整、半劳动力计算，需要六个月，也就是要到1959年4月底才能完成冬季生产计划。
    在劳动力不足的困难面前，对怎样完成冬季生产计划的问题，当时社员有四种意见。一、减少任务；二、按照已有劳动力和老办法生产，完成多少算多少；三、增加劳动强度，每天多劳动几小时，多搞几次夜战；四、充分发挥公社大而公的优越条件，加强思想教育，提高社员觉悟，把广大社员的生产积极性调动起来，同时，一面改善劳动组织，一面大搞工具改革，以提高生产效率。针对以上四种主张，公社党委组织全体社员展开辩论。在辩论中，许多社员指出，第一种和第二种意见是保守和消极的，如果这样作，就不能实现1959年更大的跃进。同时，大家认为第三种意见也不是好办法，不应从延长劳动时间、增加劳动强度来找出路。最后全体社员同意了第四种主张，一致认为完成冬季生产任务的办法是：一、合理安排劳动力，建立生产责任制，改善劳动组织；二、在水利、积肥、副业等各项生产中全面开展工具改革；三、加强经常性的社会主义和共产主义教育，发挥社员的共产主义劳动精神。
    公社党委根据全体社员辩论后提出的三个办法，制订了保证完成冬季生产任务的三项措施，两个多月已经收到了明显的效果。
    湖南公社采取的第一项措施是改善劳动组织。公社根据各项生产任务的特点和需要，将全社七千多个劳力统一作了合理的安排：除抽出一千二百五十名较强的劳动力兴修水利，其余五千多名较强或有某项生产技术和经验的劳动力全部投入搞副业和积肥、田间管理等。同时，采取定人、定地区、定数量、定质量、定时间的 “五定”办法，层层建立了生产责任制，把生产责任交给社员；并调整了劳动力的级别，全社劳力划分为五级，各级都有不同的劳动定额。这样，既发挥了社员各人所长，提高了劳动效率，又加强了社员的生产责任心，鼓舞了更大的生产热情。
    大规模开展工具改革，发动群众创造并及时推广新的生产工具和先进经验，是湖南公社解决劳动力不足的第二项有效措施。公社党委发动全体社员在一个月内赶制了五千部车子，并全部装上了滚珠，使水利、积肥等各项生产的运输都实现了车子化，基本上消灭了肩挑现象。全社最大的水利工程卫星水库开工时，一千八百多人上工，每天仅能完成一千二百个土方；后来工地开展了技术革新运动，群众创制了十多种先进工具，上工人数减少了三分之一，每日完成土方却上升到四千八百多方。
    湖南公社的第三项措施是加强对社员经常性的教育。具体办法一个是发动群众开展自我教育，互相批评；一个是队和队、组和组、社员和社员之间开展评比竞赛，比工效，比进度，比质量，比思想好；一个是办好政治、文化、技术、体育四结合的学校，组织全体社员每天参加二小时学习。通过竞赛和学习，许多社员学会了新的生产技术，提高了思想觉悟，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，大大发挥了共产主义劳动精神。
    现在，湖南人民公社一部分冬季生产任务已接近完成，有的已提前完成；对于薄弱环节，如积肥，公社正从已完工的水利工地上抽调劳力进行突击。
