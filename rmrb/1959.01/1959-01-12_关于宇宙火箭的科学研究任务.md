Regarding Scientific Research Tasks Concerning Space Rockets

Editor's Note According to newspaper reports, the Soviet space rocket is undertaking the following scientific exploration tasks: exploring the Moon's magnetic field; investigating the intensity and intensity changes of cosmic rays outside the Earth's magnetic field; recording photons in cosmic rays; exploring the Moon's radioactivity; studying the distribution of heavy atomic nuclei in cosmic rays; studying the gaseous composition of interstellar matter; studying solar corpuscular radiation; and studying meteor particles. What is the significance of examining and studying these issues? The following is an explanation provided by scientific workers from relevant departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    **Exploring the Moon's Magnetic Field**

    As everyone knows, the Earth is a large magnet; placing a small magnetic needle around it will cause it to be affected and point in a certain direction (such as the compass, which is made based on this effect). We call such a space with magnetic force a magnetic field. Does the Moon also have a magnetic field similar to the Earth's magnetic field (called the lunar magnetic field)? If it exists, what is its strength? This is one of the many significant scientific questions that the giant space rocket successfully launched by the Soviet Union recently aims to explore.

    For a long time, scientists have had various speculations about whether the Moon has magnetic phenomena, most of which are negative. Even if affirmative, it is believed that its intensity is only one-six-hundredth of the Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, there has never been a way to solve this mystery. However, the instruments on the Soviet space rocket this time have sufficient sensitivity, not only to measure the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field at a considerable distance, but also to have the first possibility of knowing the magnetism of the lunar region.

    Although our ancestors first discovered the fact that the Earth has magnetism thousands of years ago, the source of the Earth's magnetic field is still unclear. The more recognized theory tends to favor the Earth's magnetic source being in the Earth's core. Therefore, if the existence of the lunar magnetic field is measured, it may be possible to use this method to study the internal structure of the Moon (such as whether it has a core similar to the Earth's core, etc.), as well as to further understand the root of the Earth's magnetic field.

    Magnetic phenomena have also been discovered on the Sun for a long time. Since the Sun is a hot body, its magnetic field may have a different source from the Earth's magnetic field. Now, using space rockets to investigate the magnetism on the cold, "dead" Moon also provides the possibility of further understanding the nature of the Sun's magnetic field.

    In the past decade, in addition to the Earth and the Sun, many stars have been found to have magnetic fields. According to research, although the magnetic field strength of several stars varies greatly, the proportional constant between the magnetic moment of their magnetic fields and the angular momentum of their rotation is almost the same. Therefore, some people believe that the rotation of huge celestial bodies may be the source of magnetic fields. In order to verify whether this important theory is finally established, in addition to exploring the magnetism of other celestial bodies that have magnetic fields larger than the Earth's magnetic field, it is also necessary to explore whether the lunar magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's magnetic field, also has similar regularity.

    From the above, it can be seen that using space rockets to explore the lunar magnetic field has tremendous scientific significance.

    **Investigating the Intensity and Intensity Changes of Cosmic Rays Outside the Earth's Magnetic Field**

    Primary cosmic rays are mainly composed of positively charged protons and other atomic nuclei. They will be deflected when moving in the Earth's magnetic field. Except near the Earth's magnetic north and south poles, many cosmic ray particles with relatively low energy cannot reach the Earth's surface and are bent back. Therefore, measuring the intensity of cosmic rays on the Earth's surface, or even measuring the intensity of cosmic rays on artificial satellites, results in a lower intensity than the true cosmic ray intensity in space. Measuring the law of change of cosmic ray intensity in the Earth's magnetic field is also affected by the change of the Earth's magnetic field. Lunar rockets can reach hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from the Earth, where they are no longer affected by the Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, using instruments equipped on rockets, one can directly investigate knowledge of the intensity and intensity changes of cosmic rays in space, which can be more reliable than the results of artificial satellites and ground observations. This information is extremely important for solving the problem of the origin of cosmic rays and is unobtainable using various methods in the past.

    **Recording Photons in Cosmic Rays**

    Light, X-rays, and γ-rays are all composed of countless photons. Their rest mass is zero and they do not carry electric charge. Photons in cosmic rays generally have much higher energy than photons in γ-rays. According to the materials published so far, it is not yet certain whether photons exist in primary cosmic rays (that is, rays that have flown from space and have not been affected by the atmosphere). Due to the interaction between photons and matter in the atmosphere, a series of electromagnetic interaction processes occur, in which secondary photons (that is, photons produced after the interaction between primary cosmic rays and the atmosphere) appear. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish whether the measured photons are primary cosmic rays or secondary photons in the atmosphere. However, the use of space rockets or artificial satellites can overcome this difficulty and directly determine whether photons exist in primary cosmic rays. If photons exist, then a directional measuring device installed on a rocket or satellite can be further used to measure its direction. Because photons do not carry electricity, the direction of movement will not be affected by the magnetic field of interstellar space, so more direct information about the origin of cosmic rays can be obtained, and then a further understanding of the origin of cosmic rays can be obtained. Further resolution of the origin of cosmic rays will help mankind's understanding of the situation in interstellar space.

    **Exploring the Moon's Radioactivity**

    The radioactive elements on celestial bodies that have been discovered include thorium on the Sun and technetium on many stars, such as R Andromedae and R Geminorum. However, the question of whether the Moon, as the closest celestial body to us, has radioactive elements has not been studied very effectively. The issue of radioactivity is very important. From the relative content of radioactive elements in the Earth's crust, the age of the formation of the crust can be estimated (because the rate of change of radioactive elements is fixed). From the existence of radioactive elements on the Sun and stars, it can be imagined that there may be isotopes of technetium on the Sun and stars, and the half-life of these isotopes (the time required for a radioactive element to transform into other elements due to continuous radiation, when the mass is reduced by half) is not very different from the order of magnitude of the time of nuclear reactions on the Sun (100 trillion years to 10 trillion years). Or it can be imagined that unknown thermonuclear reactions are taking place on the Sun and stars, producing technetium. It is also possible that the existence of technetium on stars indicates that these stars are in a special stage of a short transition. From this, it can be seen that studying the radioactivity of celestial bodies can deepen and comprehensively understand the celestial bodies themselves and radioactive materials. If the elements on the Moon can be studied in detail and its radioactive elements are discovered, then the minimum limit of the age of the formation of lunar matter can be estimated from the relative content of radioactive elements. This is extremely important for understanding the origin and evolution of the Moon, the past and future of the Moon and the Earth, and for understanding the evolution of lighter celestial bodies in the solar system. If the radioactivity and other elemental content of the Moon are linked with the results of other celestial bodies for comprehensive research and analysis, it will not only clarify the nature and past and future of various celestial bodies, but also greatly promote the understanding of the law of distribution of chemical element content in the universe, the exploration of the origin of chemical elements, and the more comprehensive and profound understanding of the structure of matter and the law of thermonuclear reactions. Cosmic rays and radioactivity have a very close relationship. Therefore, studying these two phenomena in conjunction is more conducive to understanding both. If there are suitable radioactive elements and various suitable isotopes on the Moon, and they are brought back to Earth, they can also help industrial and agricultural production and be used for medical treatment and other countless purposes, directly promoting production and construction and prolonging human life.

    **Studying the Distribution of Heavy Atomic Nuclei in Cosmic Rays**

    According to existing experimental data, cosmic ray components contain protons (hydrogen nuclei), α particles (helium nuclei), and a small number of heavier atomic nuclei. Since heavy atomic nuclei are easily absorbed by the atmosphere, it is necessary to raise the instrument to a very high altitude to measure the proportion of heavy atomic nuclei in cosmic rays. In the past, balloons were used for detection, but the experimental time could not be long and still could not completely exceed the air layer. Therefore, the experimental materials are still very unsatisfactory. More accurate and reliable experimental materials can be obtained with artificial satellites and lunar rockets.

    When people know the distribution of heavy atomic nuclei in cosmic rays, they can use it to compare with the element distribution of matter in the universe. This can help further explore the origin of cosmic rays and then help understand the formation of the universe.

    **Studying the Gaseous Composition of Interplanetary Matter**

    Interplanetary space contains both solid and gaseous components. Solid components include meteor particles and dust, which are formed in part by the disintegration of comets and asteroids. Gaseous components are formed in part by the action of solar radiation pressure and planetary gravitational perturbation on the gas in the head and tail of comets. Because interplanetary matter permeates between objects in the solar system, its formation must be related to the origin and evolution of the entire solar system. Detailed study of the two components of interplanetary matter can provide major insights into the origin of planets, the origin and nature of comets and asteroids, and the evolution of the entire solar system. The phenomena of zodiacal light (light emitted by matter distributed along the Earth's orbital plane) and gegenschein (a faint patch of light seen from Earth in the direction opposite the Sun) are manifestations of interplanetary matter. Although many studies have been done on these phenomena in the past, they have always been conducted within or near the thin layer of the Earth's atmosphere. On the one hand, they are greatly affected by the atmosphere, and on the other hand, they only touch a small part of interplanetary matter. Now, the Soviet space rocket can penetrate deep into the interior of the area where a large amount of interplanetary matter is located. This can greatly reduce the impact of the Earth's atmosphere on the study of interplanetary matter, so that it can be completely ignored, and can also obtain unprecedentedly rich new information about interplanetary matter, especially the more difficult-to-study gaseous part. This information is very directly related to clarifying how large the Earth's atmosphere is, the details of the Earth's gaseous tail proposed by Soviet astronomer Fesenkov, and the composition and nature of zodiacal light. It also has great significance for understanding the physical and chemical properties of interplanetary matter, and the impact of interplanetary matter on rocket flight, the creation of artificial gravity and artificial atmosphere on future spacecraft, and so on.

    **Studying Solar Corpuscular Radiation**

    The Sun is a star, a luminous object. It not only emits a large amount of light waves and a large amount of heat (also emitted in the form of wave radiation) into the surrounding space, but also, according to the geophysical phenomena occurring on the Earth, the Sun also emits a large number of extremely small particles running at high speed. These particles are either negatively charged electrons, or positively charged protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei), or positively charged ions of other elements, or even uncharged neutral small particles. These small particles emitted from the Sun or its interior at high speeds are collectively called solar "corpuscular radiation" in order to distinguish them from the "wave radiation" of light and heat.

    Unless these microparticles have extremely high energy, that is to say, have an extremely high speed, close to the speed of light of 300,000 kilometers per second, like cosmic radiation, it is difficult for them to reach the ground. For example, prominences thrown upward at a speed of 300 to 400 kilometers per second (i.e., huge and prominent hot luminous matter on the Sun's surface, which can be seen very clearly with the naked eye during a total solar eclipse), the speed is reduced to zero after reaching tens of thousands of miles above the Sun's surface, and as a result, it is still sucked back by the Sun's gravity. If the initial velocity of the microparticles reaches about 2,000 kilometers per second, they can reach the space around the Earth after two or three days (the Sun's light can reach the Earth in about 500 seconds); if the microparticles are charged at this time, they will be affected by the magnetic field after entering the Earth's magnetic field and run spirally along the magnetic lines of force of the magnetic field, gathering in the high altitude above the north and south poles of the Earth. These high-speed particles collide with the atmospheric particles (such as oxygen and nitrogen in molecular and atomic states, etc.) in the Earth's high altitude, and the kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy and light energy, resulting in the phenomenon of aurora.

    At the same time, if solar microparticles are emitted in dense columnar surges, like a column of water ejected from a rubber hose, they will affect the Earth's magnetic field far away from the Earth (approximately five and a half times the Earth's radius, and some people believe that it may be as far as the Moon, i.e., sixty times the Earth's radius), causing the latter to experience a "magnetic storm," and at the same time, the structure of the "ionosphere" also undergoes great variations.

    However, all the above explanations are assumptions about the results that solar-radiated microparticles should have in order to meet the needs of explaining the ins and outs of geophysical phenomena. However, it is still not very clear how microparticles are ejected from the Sun and how they pass through a long space between the Sun and the Earth. This is primarily because, in addition to ground-based cosmic ray observations, there is a lack of direct detection of solar corpuscular radiation at high altitudes or even in outer space. The Soviet "artificial satellite" can meet the first requirement, but jumping into outer space for detection has become one of the major tasks of the "artificial planet."

    Now, the "artificial planet" has completed its task. After the data obtained is analyzed and studied by outstanding Soviet scientists, its conclusions will surely shine brightly on solar physics and geophysics, which is extremely significant not only in theoretical explanation but also in practice.

Chen Zhiqiang

    **Studying Meteor Particles**

    There are a large number of small solid particles in interplanetary space. Due to the gravitational force of the Sun, they move along various possible orbits. These small solid particles are called meteoroids or meteor particles.

    When the Earth encounters them on its orbit, meteor particles often fly into the Earth's atmosphere at tremendous speeds, burning up hotly due to friction with the air, and also causing air ionization and luminescence.

    According to observation data, there are a large number of meteor particles near the Earth's orbit. It is estimated that tens of thousands of meteor particles enter the Earth every day and night, and thousands or even tens of thousands of tons of meteor material enter the Earth every year. Moreover, this process has been going on for a long time. It can be assumed that similar situations may occur on other planets. This will naturally lead to a hypothesis that meteor material is closely related to the origin of planets.

    Therefore, accurate study of the distribution, density, and motion state of meteor material in space, as well as its physical properties, will be of great significance for understanding the origin of meteor particles and planets.

    In the past, the study of meteor particles was limited to a very small space range near the Earth. Now, the Soviet space rocket has expanded the space range for studying meteor particles by millions of times, so that richer and more representative statistical data on meteor particles can be obtained, and the particularity of meteor particle distribution in different regions of space can be understood. This is of great significance for paving the way for interstellar navigation. For example, according to existing data, the distribution of meteor material in space is not uniform, but is densely clustered in certain parts. Therefore, comprehensively understanding this distribution can allow for the selection of appropriate routes during interstellar flight to avoid their impact.

    关于宇宙火箭的科学研究任务
    编者按　据报纸报道，苏联宇宙火箭担负着以下一些科学考察任务：探查月球磁场；在地球磁场以外考察宇宙线的强度和强度变化；纪录宇宙线中的光子；探查月球的放射性；研究宇宙射线中重原子核的分布；研究星际物质的气体成分；研究太阳微粒辐射、研究流星粒子。考察和研究这些问题有什么意义呢？下面便是中国科学院有关机关的科学工作者所作的解释。探测月球磁场
    大家知道，地球是一个大磁体；把一个小磁针放在它的周围就会受到它的作用而指向一定的方位（如指南针就是根据这种作用制出的）。我们把这样的有磁力作用的空间叫做磁场。月球是否也具有与地球磁场相类似的磁场（叫做月球磁场）呢？如果存在，强度大小又如何？这是苏联最近成功地发射的巨型宇宙火箭所要探察的许多重大科学问题中的一项。
    长期以来，科学家对于月亮是否有磁性现象，有各种各样的猜测，多数是否定的，即使肯定，也认为它的强度只有地球磁场六百分之一。因此，从来还没有一种办法来解决这个谜。但是这次苏联宇宙火箭上的仪器，已有足够的灵敏度，不仅能够测定在相当远的距离上地球磁场的减弱情况，而且第一次有可能测知月球区域的磁性。
    虽然我们的祖先首先发现地球有磁性这一事实，已有数千年的历史，可是地球磁场的来源到现在还不清楚。比较公认的理论，倾向于赞成地球磁源在地球核心中。因此，如果测知月球磁场的存在，那就有可能利用这种方法来研究月球内部的构造（如它是否有与地球核心相同的核心等），以及进一步认识地球磁场的根源。
    太阳上也早发现了磁性现象。由于太阳是一个炽热体，可能它的磁场和地球磁场的来源不同。现在用宇宙火箭的方法考察在寒冷的“死寂的”月球上的磁性，也就有了进一步认识太阳磁场性质的可能性。
    近十年来，除了地球和太阳而外，又先后发现许多恒星具有磁场。根据研究指明，尽管若干星的磁场强度相差很大，但是它们磁场的磁矩大小和它们转动的角动量的比例常数，几乎相同。因此，有人根据这个理由，认为巨大的天体的转动，可能是产生磁场的根源。为了验证这一个重大学说是否最后成立，除了探察具有比地球磁场更大的其他星体的磁性而外，还须探察比地球磁场弱小的月球磁场是否也具备类似的规律性。
    由上看来，利用宇宙火箭探察月球磁场是具有非常巨大的科学意义的。
                                朱岗昆
    在地球磁场以外考察宇宙
      线的强度和强度变化
    初级宇宙线主要是由带正电的质子和其他原子核组成的。它们在地球磁场中运动时会发生偏转。除了在地磁的南北极附近以外，许多能量比较低的宇宙线粒子到不了地球表面就弯回去了。因此在地球表面测量宇宙线强度，甚至于在人造卫星上测量宇宙线强度，其结果都比真正宇宙空间的宇宙线强度低。而在地球磁场中测量宇宙线强度的变化规律也要受地球磁场变化的影响。月球火箭可到达距地球几十万公里以外，那里就不再受地球磁场的影响了。因此用装备在火箭上的仪器，可以直接考察到宇宙空间的宇宙线强度和强度变化的知识，它们可以比人造卫星、比地面观察的结果更加可靠。这些资料对解决宇宙线的来源问题极为重要，而且是过去用各种方法所得不到的。
                                  吕　敏
      记录宇宙线中的光子
    光线，X——射线，γ——射线都是由无数光子组成的。它的静止质量为零，不带电荷。宇宙线中的光子一般要比γ——射线的光子的能量高得多。根据目前已经发表的材料，在初级宇宙线（就是从宇宙间飞来的还没有受到大气层作用的射线）中是否有光子存在，到现在还没有肯定。由于光子和大气层中的物质相互作用而产生一系列的电磁作用过程，在这些过程中有次级光子（就是初级宇宙线和大气层作用以后产生的光子）出现。因而在大气层中很难区别所测量到的光子是初级宇宙线中的光子还是次级光子。但是利用宇宙火箭或人造卫星就可以克服这个困难，而直接测定初级宇宙线中是否有光子存在。如果有光子存在，就可以进一步利用装在火箭或卫星上的定向测量器来测定它的方向，而光子不带电，运动方向不会受星际空间磁场影响，这样就可更直接地获得有关宇宙线来源的资料，那么就可以对宇宙线的来源的问题得到进一步的了解。宇宙线来源的进一步解决将会帮助人类对星际间情况的了解有所帮助。
                              霍安祥探查月球的放射性
    天体上的放射性元素，已发现的有太阳上的钍
  （音土）和不少恒星上的锝（音得），例如仙女座R星和双子座R星等。但月亮作为最靠近我们的天体，它上面是否有放射性元素的问题，一直没有很有效的方法来研究。放射性的问题非常重要。从地球地壳中放射性元素的相对含量，可以估计地壳形成的年代
  （因为放射性元素变化的速度是固定的）。从太阳和恒星上放射性元素的存在，可以设想太阳和恒星上可能有锝的同位素存在，这种同位素的半衰期（放射性元素因不断放射而转变为其他元素，当质量减少一半所需的时间叫做半衰期），比太阳上进行核反应的时间的数量级（一百万万年到一千万万年），相差不很远。或者设想太阳和恒星上有我们未知的热核反应正在进行而产生出锝来，也可能恒星上锝的存在表示这些星正处在一个不长的过渡性的特殊阶段。由此可见，研究了天体的放射性，可以更深化和更全面地了解天体本身和放射性物质。如果能把月亮上的元素详加研究，发现它的放射性元素，那么从放射性元素的相对含量可以估计月亮物质形成的年限的最低限度。这对于了解月亮的起源和演化问题、月亮和地球的过去和未来，以及对于了解太阳系中较轻天体的演化都极重要。如果把月亮的放射性及其他元素的含量和别的天体上这方面的结果连系起来全部研究分析，那就不但对于弄清楚各种不同天体的本质和过去未来，而且对于了解宇宙中化学元素含量分布的规律，对于探求化学元素的起源，对于更全面更深刻地了解物质的结构和热核反应的规律，都有极大的推进作用。宇宙射线和放射性有颇密切关系，因此，把这两种现象连系起来研究，就更有利于对二者的了解。月亮上如果有适当的放射性元素和各种适当的同位素，并把它们取回到地球上来，那还可以帮助工农业生产及作医疗等等说不完的各种用途，直接促进生产建设和人类的延年益寿。

        研究宇宙线中重
          原子核分布
    根据现有实验材料看，在宇宙线成分中含有质子（氢原子核）?粒子（氦原子核）和少量更重的原子核。由于重原子核容易被大气吸收，因此要将仪器上升到很高的高空才有可能测量重原子核在宇宙线中所占的比例。以前用气球进行探测，但实验时间不能长而且仍然不能完全超出空气层，因此，实验材料还很不能令人满意。用人造卫星和月球火箭可以得到更精确可靠的实验材料。
    当人们知道宇宙线中重原子核的分布以后，可以用它来和宇宙中物质的元素分布作比较，这样可以帮助进一步探讨宇宙线起源的问题，进而有助于了解宇宙形成的问题。
                                陈松柏
    研究行星际物质气体成分
    行星际空间的物质有固体成分和气体成分，固体成分包含流星粒子和尘埃等，形成的原因之一是彗星和小行星的分裂；气体成分形成的原因之一是太阳辐射压和行星摄动力对于彗星头部和尾部气体的作用。因为行星际物质弥漫于太阳系中各物体之间，所以它的形成一定和整个太阳系的起源和演化有关；详尽研究了行星际物质的两种成分，可以对行星的起源、彗星、小行星的起源和本质及整个太阳系的演化得到重大的启发。黄道光（沿地球轨道面分布的物质所发的光）和对日照（从地球上看，在太阳反对方向的一团暗弱的光）的现象就是行星际物质的表现。过去对这些现象虽然研究很多，但始终是在地球大气密层以内或稀层附近进行研究，一方面很受大气影响，同时又只触及行星际物质很少一部分。现在，苏联的宇宙火箭能深入到大量行星际物质所处的区域内部去，这样既可使研究行星际物质时地球大气的影响大大降低以至可以完全忽略不计，又可以获得空前丰富的关于行星际物质，特别是较难研究的气体部分的新资料，这些资料对于阐明地球大气层究有多大范围，苏联天文学家费森科夫所提出的地球的气体尾巴的详情和黄道光的成分和本质，了解行星际物质的物理性质和化学成分，了解行星际物质对于火箭飞行，对于将来空间船上创造人造重力和人造大气的影响等等，都有非常直接的关系和重大的意义。
                                沈良照
        研究太阳微粒辐射
    太阳是一个恒星，是一个发光的物体。它不但向四周空间发射出大量光波以及大量热量（也是以波辐射的方式发射出去的），而且根据地球上面发生的地球物理现象看来，太阳还会放出大量以高速度运行的极微小的质点，这些质点或为带负电的电子，或为带正电的质子（即氢原子核），或为其他元素的带正电离子，甚或为不带电的中性微小粒子。这些从太阳上面或其内部发射出来的高速度的小质点，统统叫做太阳“微粒辐射”，以便与光和热的“波辐射”有所区别。
    这些微粒子除非具有极高的能量，即是说具有极大的速度，近乎每秒三十万公里的光速，好像宇宙辐射一样，否则就很难到达地面上来。比如以每秒三、四百公里向上抛出的日珥（即日面上巨大而突出的炽热发光物质，日全食可用肉眼很清楚地看到），到了离日面几万里高之后速度就减低到等于零了，结果仍然被太阳吸引力吸回去了。如果微粒初速达到每秒两千公里左右，则走了两三天之后可以走到地球的四周的空间中来（太阳的光只要五百秒钟左右就可以到达地球）；这时的微粒子如果是带电的，在它进入地球磁场内，就要受到磁场的作用而沿着磁场的磁力线作螺旋形的运行集聚在地球南北两极的高空上面去。这些高速粒子跟地球高空的大气质点（如分子和原子状态的氧和氮等等）相碰相冲，动能又变换为热能和光能而产生极光的现象。
    同时，太阳微粒子在发射出来时如成密集的柱状涌流，如像橡皮水管射出来的水柱一样，离开地球老远的地方（大致约为地球半径五倍半，也有人认为可能远到月球所在的地方，即地球半径的六十倍），就对地球磁场发生作用而使后者出现“磁暴”，同时“电离层”的结构也出现很大的变异。
    不过，上述所有解释都是设想太阳放射微粒应有的结果，以满足说明地球物理现象来龙去脉的需要。但是，微粒子如何从太阳上面打出来，又如何经过日地一段漫长的空间等等物理过程，至今还不是很清楚的。这首先是因为除了地面的宇宙线的观测外，就是缺乏在高空甚至于在地球外空直接进行太阳微粒辐射的探测。苏联的“人造卫星”可以满足第一个要求，但是，跳到地球外空去探测就成为“人造行星”的重大任务之一。
    现在“人造行星”已经完成了它的任务，所得资料经过卓越的苏联科学家们的分析研究之后，其结论必然会对于太阳物理和地球物理方面大放光彩，这不但在理论的解释上而且在实践上的意义也都是极其重大的。
                                陈志强
          研究流星粒子
    在行星际空间有大量的微小固体质点。由于太阳的引力作用，它们沿着各种可能的轨道运动。这些固体小质点，我们称之为流星质点或流星粒子。
    当地球在公转轨道上跟它们相遇时，流星粒子就往往会以巨大的速度飞入地球大气层与空气摩擦而灼热地烧毁，并且也会引起空气电离和发光。
    根据观测资料，在地球轨道附近有大量的流星粒子，估计每昼夜穿入地球的流星粒子可达数万个，而每年进入地球的流星物质，可达数千吨乃至数万吨。并且这种过程很久以前已经在进行。可以推想，其他行星也可能有类似的情况发生。这样就自然会引起一种假设，认为流星物质和行星的起源有密切的关系。
    因此，精确研究流星物质在空间的分布、密度和运动状态以及它的物理性质，对于了解流星粒子和行星的起源问题都会有十分重大的意义。
    过去研究流星粒子是限于靠近地球的很小空间范围内，现在用苏联的宇宙火箭把研究流星粒子的空间范围扩大千百万倍，就可以取得更丰富更有代表性的流星粒子统计资料，了解在空间不同区域流星粒子分布方面的特殊性，等等。这对于铺平星际航行的道路有着非常重大的意义。例如，据现在已有资料，流星物质在空间的分布并不是均匀的，而是成群地密集在某些部分。因此，全面地了解这种分布状况，可以在星际飞行时选择适当路线，以避免它们的冲击。
