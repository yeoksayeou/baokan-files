　　Hu Jinhai and Hu Jinmu were two cousins. The two brothers joined the army together and served as soldiers in the 1st company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery battalion. Whether in work or study, they were always neck and neck. Therefore, not long after joining the army, the two brothers joined the Communist Youth League together, and later became deputy squad leaders together.

　　During the great leap forward in training, the younger brother, Hu Jinmu, was first rated as a shooting pacesetter. This made the older brother, Hu Jinhai, anxious. He really got up before dawn and went to bed late, practicing hard! Practicing hard! He was determined to catch up with his younger brother. As a result, in two shooting practices, Hu Jinmu shot a pistol, once excellent, once good. Hu Jinhai shot a rifle five for five once, and a pistol good once. Neither of them lagged behind. After the company proposed creating versatile gunners, the two brothers fought for three days and both achieved all-around capability.

　　When they heard that live ammunition firing was about to be carried out with a single gun, they jumped up with joy. The older brother said, "This is a test for us gunners, we must do well!" The younger brother said, "If we don't do well, we won't see the leap forward of our gunners!" So, the two brothers secretly competed again.

　　On the day of the live ammunition firing, the two brothers entered the firing range together. Truly, heroes on the battlefield have soaring ambition. The older brother, Hu Jinhai, first fired at the enemy's "tank" at a distance of 800 meters. He fired three shells in a row, all hitting the target. The younger brother, Hu Jinmu, couldn't suppress his excitement. As soon as he heard the squad leader's order, he immediately jumped onto the gun mount and with a "boom," a hole was blown in the rear of the "tank." Then he fired two more times, all hitting the target.

    哥儿俩
    胡金海、胡金木是一对堂兄弟。哥俩一起入伍，一起在某部战防炮营一连当战士。不论工作、学习，他俩都是半尺和五寸，一般齐。因此，入伍不久，哥俩一起加入共青团，以后又一起当了副班长。
  在训练大跃进中，弟弟胡金木先被评为射击标兵，这下哥哥胡金海可着了急，真是起五更、睡半夜，练呀！练呀！一定要赶上弟弟。结果，两次射击，胡金木打手枪，一次优秀，一次良好。胡金海一次步枪五发五中，一次手枪良好。谁也没拉下谁。连里提出创造多能炮手以后，哥俩又奋战三天，都达到了全能。
    听说要进行单炮实弹射击了，他俩高兴得跳起来。哥哥说：“这下对我们瞄准手是个考验，一定要打好！”弟弟说：“打不好，看不出咱们瞄准手的跃进来！”于是，哥俩又暗暗地竞赛起来。
    实弹射击那天，哥俩一起进入射击场。真是英雄上阵地，志气万丈高。哥哥胡金海首先在八百公尺的距离上，对敌人“坦克”射击，他接连发射三发炮弹，全部命中目标。弟弟胡金木心里压不住激动，一听班长命令，马上跳上炮架，“轰”地一声，“坦克”后部打了一个窟窿。接着又发射两次，全都命中目标。
