Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In 1958, the production of building materials in our country shone brilliantly, achieving an overall bumper harvest. Whether it was bricks, tiles, sand, stone, cement, glass, ceramics, or other non-metallic mineral products used for construction, production increased significantly compared to the previous year. The output of some products doubled or even increased several times. Throughout the year, more than 200 new products were trial-produced and manufactured, along with a large number of substitutes. This greatly changed the past situation where building materials only consisted of "bricks, tiles, ash, sand, stone, reinforced concrete."

According to estimates from relevant departments, by the end of last year, the output of bricks would reach approximately 40 billion pieces, more than double that of the previous year. The output of tiles would also increase by about 1.5 times compared to the previous year. Some brick and tile factories also produced many new products such as special-shaped bricks, porous bricks, expanded bricks, and hollow floor tiles. The "lightweight large bricks" produced for building tall buildings and high-rise factories weigh only a quarter of the weight of ordinary bricks of the same volume. Using this type of brick can reduce the self-weight of buildings and lower project costs. Various regions also used shale, slag, red mud, diatomaceous earth mixed with silicate to make bricks of different colors. These bricks not only beautify buildings, but more importantly, they do not require firing, which can save a large amount of coal used for firing. The nationwide brick and tile industry widely promoted the "kiln-free brick firing method," making, firing, and using bricks locally, avoiding long-distance transportation of bricks and tiles, and thus was welcomed by the masses.

To date, the production of both foreign and native cement has exceeded 10 million tons, a fifteen-fold increase compared to cement production in 1949. This is an achievement made by the cement industry in implementing the policy of combining "large foreign groups" and "small native groups." There are now more than 40,000 native cement kilns across the country. These small cement plants use native kilns and native mechanical equipment, with very low costs, and are extremely popular among the masses. "Foreign" cement production is also very active. After cement plants in various regions promoted the advanced production experience of "three highs and one fast" (high wind, high fire, high material input and fast rotary kiln speed), the output increased rapidly. In addition to producing various high-grade cement for general engineering use, quick-setting cement, dam cement, oil well cement, expanding cement, and alumina cement have also been produced to meet the needs of various projects. The variety of cement has increased from three in 1949 to the current twenty-four. In addition, the production of asbestos cement pipes has also begun, which can replace cast iron pipes for some water supply and oil pipelines.

The production of glass, ceramics, sand, stone, and non-metallic mineral products is even more rich and colorful. Currently, more than five million cases of flat glass have been produced, equivalent to the total glass production in the sixteen years before liberation. Many new glass products have begun to be used to replace some steel bars as building materials. One ton of glass fiber reinforcement can replace three tons of steel reinforcement; it is more resistant to acid and corrosion than steel reinforcement. Currently, efforts should be further made to reduce production costs. Glass wool is a good material for sound insulation and heat preservation. These products are currently being produced by many construction sites and people's communes using indigenous methods. The sanitary equipment, water supply, drainage, heating, gas pipelines, and industrial transportation pipelines of many buildings are made of glass or ceramics, which can save a large amount of steel at present. Panoramic glass for cars has already begun to be produced, and using this glass to decorate doors and windows provides soft light. The tempered glass produced last year has no sharp edges, and it does not prick the hand when broken; there is also a type of laminated glass that is not easily detached when broken, which is safety glass for automobiles and high-speed transportation. Ceramic radiators have also been produced in batches. A ceramic factory in Shenyang produced more than 50,000 radiators throughout the year, saving the country 1,000 tons of pig iron.

Although the production of building materials in our country has increased significantly, it still cannot keep up with the needs of large-scale national construction. Last year, the masses discovered hundreds of substitutes for building materials, using slag, magnesite, rice straw, shavings, sawdust, cotton stalks, wild grass, etc. The "four-no-use" building built in Harbin and the "waste material" building built in Tianjin have used a large number of these "new" building materials, which are not only beautiful in appearance but also very strong in texture.

### 建筑材料全面丰收  砖瓦、砂石、水泥、玻璃、陶瓷产量倍增，新产品增加两百多种

    建筑材料全面丰收
    砖瓦、砂石、水泥、玻璃、陶瓷产量倍增，新产品增加两百多种
    据新华社讯　1958年我国建筑材料的生产大放异彩，获得了全面丰收。无论砖瓦、砂石、水泥、玻璃、陶瓷及其它建筑用的非金属矿产品都比去年增产很多，有些产品的产量增长了一倍到几倍。全年仅试制和生产的新产品就有两百多种，还有大量的代用品。这样就使过去建筑材料只有“砖瓦灰砂石、钢筋混凝土”的面貌大为改观。
    据有关部门预计，到去年年底，砖的产量将达到四百亿块左右，比前年增加一倍多。瓦的产量也将比前年增加一倍半左右。有些砖瓦厂还生产了许多异形砖、多孔砖、膨胀砖、楼板空心砖等新产品。为建筑高楼大厦和高型厂房而生产的“轻质大砖”，只有同样体积的普通砖重量的四分之一，使用这种砖，能减轻建筑物的自重量，降低工程造价。各地还采用页岩、矿渣、赤泥、矽藻土掺矽酸盐做不同颜色的砖，这种砖不但可以美化建筑物，而且更重要的是它不用烧制，可以节约大量烧制用的煤炭。全国砖瓦业广泛推行了“无窑烧砖法”，就地做坯、烧制、使用，避免了砖瓦长途运输，因而受到群众的欢迎。
    到目前为止，洋、土水泥生产量已超过一千万吨，比1949年水泥产量增长十五倍。这是水泥工业贯彻“大洋群”和“小土群”相结合方针所取得的成绩。全国现在已有四万多个土水泥窑。这些小水泥厂使用土窑、土机械设备，造价很低，极受群众的欢迎。“洋”水泥生产也很活跃，各地水泥厂推行大风、大火、大料和快速转窑的“三大一快”先进生产经验以后，产量提高得很快。除了生产一般工程使用的各种高标号水泥以外，还生产了快硬水泥、大坝水泥、油井水泥、膨胀水泥及矾土水泥，适应于各种工程的需要。水泥品种由1949年的三种增加到现在的二十四种。另外还开始生产石棉水泥管，可以代替铸铁管做部分上水道和部分输油管。
    玻璃、陶瓷、砂石及非金属矿产品的生产，更为丰富多彩。平板玻璃目前已生产了五百多万箱，相当于解放以前十六年玻璃产量的总和。许多玻璃新产品已开始用来代替部分钢筋做建筑材料。一吨玻璃丝筋可顶三吨钢筋使用；耐酸、防腐远比钢筋好，目前还该进一步努力降低生产成本。玻璃棉是隔音、保温的好材料。这些产品，目前许多建筑工地和人民公社都在用土法生产。许多建筑物的卫生设备、给水、排水、暖气、煤气的管道和工业运输管道，是用玻璃或陶瓷做的，在目前可以节省大量钢铁。小汽车用的全景玻璃已经开始生产，用这种玻璃装饰门窗，光线柔和。去年生产的钢化玻璃没有棱角，碎了抓到手里不刺人；还有一种碰碎也不易脱掉的夹层玻璃，是汽车和高速交通工具用的安全玻璃。陶瓷暖气片也已成批生产。沈阳一个陶瓷厂全年就生产暖气片五万多件，为国家节约了一千吨生铁。
    我国建筑材料虽然增产很大，但是仍然赶不上国家大规模建筑的需要。去年，群众发掘了用炉渣、菱苦土、稻草、刨花、木屑、棉秆、野草等数百种代用品做建筑材料。哈尔滨建成的“四不用”大楼，天津市建成的“废料”大楼，就大量采用了这些“新型”建筑材料，不但表面美观，质地也很坚牢。
