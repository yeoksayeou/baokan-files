　　　　Strengthen Ideological Education, Diligently Study Theory

"Virtuality and Reality" published an editorial in its first issue of this year entitled "New Year Outlook." The editorial stated: The great achievements of the past year have made us understand even more deeply that the combination of the correct leadership of the Party and the demands of the masses can form an indestructible and invincible force, becoming the source of victory for all our undertakings. It also eloquently demonstrates that only by correctly handling contradictions among the people and constantly adjusting the relationships between people can we fully mobilize positive factors and promote the high-speed development of productive forces. It also powerfully proves that once the broad masses break down superstitions and liberate their minds, people's subjective initiative can be fully发挥 (fā huī - give play to, bring out) and they can demonstrate unparalleled power in the struggle to transform society and nature. After proposing the tasks of the industrial front, the agricultural front, and consolidating the people's communes, the editorial discussed the issues of ideological education, cadre style, and studying theory.

Regarding the issue of ideological education, the editorial stated: At present, the situation is developing very rapidly, which will inevitably cause different reactions in people's minds and generate many new problems. In order to enable people to consciously treat the new situation, in order to continue to greatly destroy capitalist ideology and greatly establish communist ideology, it is necessary to combine the rectification of communes and production and construction, and, in light of the ideological trends of various strata, be targeted, prescribe the right medicine, and universally and deeply carry out socialist and communist education. To enable everyone to correctly understand our country's socialist system, this is the starting point for the current program of action and policies, but our thinking must be armed with communism.

Regarding the issue of cadre style, the editorial stated: Generally speaking, since the rectification campaign, the cadre style has greatly improved, which is the mainstream that should be affirmed first. However, we must also see that due to the great leap forward in production and the victory of communization, a few cadres are not calm enough and have developed problems such as coercion and commandism, exaggeration and untruthfulness, arrogance and complacency, and detachment from the masses; these are of course only one finger or even less than one finger's worth of problems, and it would be very dangerous to lose direction by being blinded by a leaf and not seeing Mount Tai; but it would also be wrong and harmful to only see or be satisfied with the nine fingers and not see the one finger's worth of problems. We must educate all cadres to truly establish a mass line style, always humbly listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses, consult with the masses on matters, then concentrate the opinions of the masses, and implement them among the masses, so that they become conscious actions of the masses. At the same time, we must also educate all cadres to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a practical spirit. We must not only dare to imagine and dare to create, but also do everything from reality, conduct more investigation and research, and respect objective laws, so that our judgment of the situation is close to objective reality, and prevent the style of being flashy but not practical, and superficial but not deep. In short, the heart must be hot and the head must be cold, both encouraging enthusiasm and leaving room for maneuver, building the Great Leap Forward on a more solid foundation.

Regarding the issue of studying theory, the editorial stated: In the Great Leap Forward, work experience is very rich, and new problems are constantly emerging. The former requires us to elevate it to the height of theory to guide future work; the latter requires us to analyze and deal with it with a higher level of ideological thinking. This all illustrates the urgent significance of improving the theoretical level. However, there are still some people who have not paid enough attention to studying theory and are satisfied with narrow practical experience, which must be overcome. Practice produces theory, which is beyond doubt, but practice is not equal to theory, and it must be summarized and improved to extract regular knowledge from practical experience before it can form theory.

　　　　The Key Lies in Raising Awareness and Improving Style

"Ideological Front" published a commentary in its first issue of this year entitled "Improve Thinking, Achieve a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward." The commentary believes that the key to realizing a greater leap forward plan lies in constantly improving the thinking and style of cadres. The commentary first talked about continuing to oppose conservatism, breaking down superstitions, and drumming up enthusiasm: Our opposition to conservative thinking is to enable people's understanding to correctly reflect objective reality; to see both the difficult side and the more favorable side; to see both objective conditions and the more subjective strength; to see both things and people. Promote the combination of revolutionary enthusiasm and pragmatic spirit. Liberating the mind and breaking down superstitions is precisely to respect science and respect materialism. Breaking down superstitions cannot mean breaking down science as superstition, and liberating the mind does not mean not considering issues realistically. While opposing conservatism, we must also pay attention to guard against exaggeration. We must not only put forward positive and advanced indicators, but also have sufficient and reliable measures and methods to ensure the realization of the indicators. Any empty slogans and exaggerated formalism are incompatible with the policy of opposing conservatism and striving for advancement.

When talking about adhering to the mass line and carrying out mass movements on a large scale, the commentary believes that correct thinking is closely related to the working methods of the mass line. Respecting the practice of the masses, respecting the revolutionary spirit and creativity of the masses, is respecting materialism and respecting dialectics. Only those who always adhere to the mass line can constantly absorb strength and wisdom from the masses; can have both soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of seeking truth. Those who are detached from the masses and cannot breathe fresh air are either not enthusiastic enough or are just thinking wildly. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we made great progress and gains in implementing the mass line. However, it should also be seen that due to the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, the rapid and smooth victory of the people's commune movement, and the great trust and enthusiastic support of the broad masses for the Party, the minds of some cadres have begun to heat up again; thinking that wherever they point, the masses can do; thinking that it is easy to mobilize the masses and no longer need to carry out arduous persuasive education work; these comrades do not understand that building socialism and preparing conditions for the future transition to communism is a continuous revolution. In this process, the old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions will emerge; this step of work is done well, and the next step of work requires us to learn from scratch. At the same time, the consciousness of the masses also needs to be continuously improved. Old ideological problems are resolved, and new ideological problems will arise; this problem is clearly understood, and another problem may not be clearly understood. Therefore, we also have no reason to ignore the persuasive education work of the masses.

### 尊重群众实践  掌握客观规律

1959-01-03

专栏：在理论刊物上

    尊重群众实践
    掌握客观规律
        加强思想教育　刻苦学习理论
    “虚与实”今年第一期发表了社论“新年展望”，社论说：过去一年来的伟大成就，使我们更加懂得了：党的正确领导和群众的要求相结合，就能形成一股无坚不摧、无攻不克的力量，成为我们一切事业胜利的源泉。它又雄辩地说明了：只有正确处理人民内部矛盾，不断调整人与人之间的相互关系，才能充分调动积极因素，推动生产力的高速度发展。它还有力地证明了：当广大群众一旦破除了迷信，解放了思想，人们的主观能动性就能得到充分的发挥，在改造社会、改造自然的斗争中，就能表现出无比的威力。社论在提出工业战线上、农业战线上以及整顿人民公社的任务后，谈了思想教育问题，干部作风问题和学习理论问题。
    关于思想教育问题，社论说：现在，形势的发展十分迅速，这必然要在人们思想上引起不同的反映，产生许多新的问题。为了使人们能够自觉地对待新的形势，为了继续大破资本主义思想，大立共产主义思想，必须结合整顿公社和生产建设，针对各阶层的思想动态，有的放矢，对症下药，普遍地、深入地进行一次社会主义和共产主义教育。使大家正确认识我国的社会主义制度，这是当前行动纲领和方针政策的出发点，但我们的思想则必须用共产主义来武装。
    关于干部作风问题，社论说：就总的情况来说，自整风以来，干部作风有了很大改进，这是首先应当肯定的主流。但是，我们也要看到，由于生产大跃进和公社化的胜利，有少数干部头脑不够冷静，滋长了强迫命令、浮夸不实、骄傲自满、脱离群众等毛病；这些当然只是一个指头甚至不到一个指头的问题，如果一叶障目而不见泰山，那就会迷失方向，是十分危险的；但如果只看到或满足于九个指头，而看不到一个指头的问题，那也是错误的和有害的。要教育所有干部切实树立群众路线的作风，随时虚心倾听群众的批评和意见，做到有事和群众商量，再集中群众的意见，贯彻到群众中去，使之成为群众自觉的行动。同时还要教育所有干部把革命热情和实际精神结合起来。既要敢于设想、敢于创造，又要做到一切从实际出发、多作调查研究、尊重客观规律，使自己对情况的判断接近客观实际，防止华而不实、浮而不深的作风。总之，心要热，头要冷，既鼓干劲，又留余地，把大跃进建立在更坚实的基础上。
    关于学习理论的问题，社论说：在大跃进中，工作经验十分丰富，新的问题不断出现，前者需要我们把它提升到理论的高度，用来指导今后的工作；后者需要我们以较高的思想水平来分析和处理。这都说明了提高理论水平的迫切意义。但是，现在还有一些人对学习理论没有引起足够的重视，而满足于狭隘的实践经验，这是必须克服的。实践出理论，这是不容置疑的，但实践还不等于理论，必须通过总结和提高，从实践经验中抽出规律性的知识，才能形成理论。
        关键在于提高认识改进作风
    “思想战线”今年第一期发表了题为“提高思想，实现更大更好更全面的跃进”的评论。评论认为，实现更大跃进的计划的关键，在于不断的提高干部思想和作风。评论首先谈到了继续反对保守，破除迷信，鼓足干劲的问题：我们反对保守思想，就是为了使人们的认识能够正确地反映客观实际；既看到困难的一面，更要看到有利的一面；既要看到客观条件，更看到主观力量；既见物，又见人。提倡把革命热情和务实精神结合起来。解放思想，破除迷信，正是要尊重科学，尊重唯物论。破除迷信，不能把科学当作迷信破除了，解放思想，也不是不要实事求是地考虑问题了。在反对保守的同时，还要注意力戒浮夸。我们不但要提出积极的、先进的指标，而且必须要有保证指标实现的充分可靠的措施和办法。任何空喊和浮夸的形式主义作风，都是和反对保守、力争上游的方针不相容的。
    在谈到坚持群众路线，大搞群众运动的问题时，评论认为正确的思想，是和群众路线的工作方法密切相关的。尊重群众的实践，尊重群众的革命性和创造性，就是尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法。只有时刻坚持群众路线的人，才能不断地从群众中吸取力量和智慧；才能既有冲天的干劲，又有求实的精神。那些脱离群众，呼吸不到新鲜空气的人，不是干劲不足，就是凭空乱想。在1958年的大跃进中，我们在贯彻群众路线方面有了很大的进步和收获。但是，也应当看到，由于社会主义建设的大跃进，由于人民公社化运动迅速而顺利地取得胜利，由于广大群众对党的极大的信任和热烈的拥护，有一些干部的头脑又开始发热；以为自己指到哪里，群众就能干到哪里；以为发动群众很容易，不再需要进行艰苦的说服教育工作；这些同志不懂得建设社会主义和为将来过渡到共产主义准备条件，是一个不断革命的过程。在这个过程中，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会出现；这一步工作做好了，下一步工作又需要我们从头学起。同时，群众的觉悟也是需要不断提高的。旧的思想问题解决了，新的思想问题又会产生；在这个问题上认识清楚了，在另一个问题上又可能认识不清。因此，我们也没有理由可以忽视对群众的说服教育工作。
