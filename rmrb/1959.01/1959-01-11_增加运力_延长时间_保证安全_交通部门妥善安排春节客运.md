Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The Spring Festival is approaching, and relevant departments have made arrangements for the Spring Festival passenger transport work. It is reported that, in addition to mobilizing all available passenger cars for transportation and making full use of long-distance passenger car carriages to run short-distance passenger cars during idle times, the railway department also plans to extract about 4,000 freight cars to transport passengers while ensuring the transportation of necessary materials. Water and road transportation departments have also decided to transfer some cargo ships and trucks to participate in passenger transport. Additional services will be added to vehicles and ships transporting passengers as needed. In order to compensate for the shortage of transportation tools in the urban suburbs during the Spring Festival, various localities are also preparing to mobilize and organize vehicles from government agencies, schools, enterprises, and military units to participate in passenger transport.

According to preliminary investigations and estimates by transportation departments, the number of passengers traveling by rail, road, and water during this Spring Festival will increase significantly compared to previous years. However, during this period, the transportation tasks of steel and other industrial production and construction necessities, as well as the transfer of daily necessities, are also very heavy. The number of vehicles and ships is still not sufficient to meet the needs. In order to avoid excessive concentration of Spring Festival passenger transport, causing congestion, relevant departments have decided to appropriately extend the Spring Festival passenger transport time to one and a half months, that is, from January 15th to the end of February. The People's Committees of various localities will uniformly arrange the Spring Festival holidays for universities, colleges, government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises according to this date, some earlier, some later. Relevant departments require that large-scale meetings held in major cities (especially Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, etc.) or organized visits to other places should preferably be conducted before January 15th or postponed until after March.

Doing a good job in safe transportation is very important. Relevant departments hope that passengers traveling during the Spring Festival will abide by order, take care of each other, and not carry dangerous goods on board vehicles and ships. Transportation departments should also strengthen their forces, maintain order in ports, stations, and vehicles and ships, carefully inspect the quality of vehicles and ships, strictly abide by safety operating procedures, and ensure transportation safety during the Spring Festival.

    增加运力　延长时间　保证安全
    交通部门妥善安排春节客运
    新华社10日讯　春节快要到来，有关部门对于春节旅客运输的工作已经做了安排。据悉，铁道部门除了动员全部能用的客车投入运输、充分利用长途客车的车厢在空隙时间套跑短途客车以外，还计划在保证必要物资运输的同时，抽出四千辆左右的货车运送旅客。水路和公路运输部门也决定抽调一部分货船和货车参加客运。运送旅客的车、船，都将根据需要加开班次。为了弥补春节期间城市近郊运输工具的不足，各个地方还准备动员和组织机关、学校、企业和部队的车辆参加客运。
    据交通运输部门的初步调查和估计，今年春节期间无论铁路、公路和水路，旅客来往数量都将比往年增加很多，但是在这期间，钢铁和其他工业生产建设必需的物资运输和人民生活必需品的调运任务也很繁重。车、船的数量还满足不了需要。为了避免春节旅客运输过分集中，造成拥挤，有关部门决定将春节旅客运输时间适当延长为一个半月，即从1月15日起到2月底止。各个地方的人民委员会将按照这个日期，对大专学校、机关团体和工矿企业的春节放假时间统一安排，有些提前，有些推后。有关部门要求各大城市（尤其是北京、上海、天津等地）召开的大型会议或是组织到外地参观，最好提前在1月15日以前或者推迟到3月以后进行。
    做好安全运输工作非常重要。有关部门希望春节期间来往的旅客要遵守秩序，相互照顾，不要携带危险品上船上车。交通运输部门也要增强力量，维持港口、车站和车船上的秩序，认真检查车船的质量，严格遵守安全操作规程，确保春节期间的运输安全。
