    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th. The Yincheng Red Flag People's Commune in Changzhi City, through mass airing of views and debates, has further enhanced everyone's confidence in a comprehensive and greater leap forward in 1959, and affirmed the "Eight-Character Constitution" as an important magic weapon for further leaps in agricultural production.

    This commune held a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader on January 4 to discuss and formulate a plan for a greater leap forward in agriculture in 1959. The initial question encountered at the meeting was whether a greater leap forward was possible in 1959. All the cadres present unanimously recognized the tremendous achievements of 1958, saying: One year of leap forward, brilliant achievements, industrial output value increased fivefold, and grain output doubled, which is visible to all. However, opinions were not entirely consistent on whether a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward was possible in 1959. Some people said: In previous years, production increased by only ten or twenty jin, but last year it doubled, which really exhausted our efforts! Some people said: Pear trees still need to rest every other year, can the land continue to increase production significantly? However, many people disagreed with this view, believing that a greater leap forward in 1959 was possible. After discussion, everyone's understanding became consistent. They summarized eight favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in 1959: (1) The people's minds have been further liberated, and their awareness has been greatly improved; (2) Cadres at all levels have rich experience in leading large-scale production last year; (3) Agricultural machinery has increased, from only seven or eight units last year to one hundred and twenty-one units this year; (4) This year, the basic farmland system has been implemented, which can concentrate efforts to cultivate the land well; (5) The commune has established forty-seven factories, which can directly serve agricultural production; (6) Irrigated land has increased from 18,000 mu last year to 65,000 mu, with an average of one mu of irrigated land per person; (7) Collective welfare undertakings have developed, freeing up more than 1,000 female laborers to participate in production; (8) The integration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers facilitates organization and collaboration.

    After everyone saw clearly the favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in 1959, the focus of discussion shifted to the question of "how to achieve a greater leap forward." Based on the spirit of "cannot be completed without effort, can be completed with effort; cannot be reached by standing, can be reached by jumping," and starting from the specific conditions of the commune, through careful analysis and calculation, it was decided to raise the commune's grain production plan to 1,500 jin per mu, an increase of more than double compared to last year. In order to place the plan on a reliable foundation, in the spirit of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures," increase production measures were sought from various aspects. Finally, it was unanimously believed that the "Eight-Character Constitution" is the magic weapon for increasing production. Strengthening political and ideological work under the leadership of the Party, relying on the masses, and implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" will completely enable the leap forward indicators to be achieved. They also made the following decisions: (1) Realize water conservancy. On the basis of the existing 65,000 mu of irrigated land, further water conservancy construction will be carried out to achieve comprehensive water conservancy. (2) Vigorously increase fertilizer application. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu will be increased from 30,000 jin last year to 60,000 jin, and the quality will be improved. Implement the policy of mainly using farmyard manure and supplemented by native fertilizer, achieving one pig per mu of land, and vigorously grasp the management of large livestock, pigs, and sheep; one hundred and twenty-five native fertilizer plants will be established throughout the commune. (3) Deep plow all land to about one chi, and deep plow the 30,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields to three chi. Complete the task of controlling soil erosion on 40,000 mu of cultivated land. (4) Thoroughly carry out seed revolution. All corn will be planted with Golden Queen, millet will be planted with Red and White Mother Hen Beak, and potatoes will be promoted with Wutai White. (5) Promote dense planting completely. Each mu of corn will have 3,000 to 6,000 plants, and each mu of millet will have 40,000 to 80,000 plants. (6) Start eliminating underground insects now to achieve a insect-free commune. (7) Standardize field management. More than 70% of cultivated land should be turned into garden-like fields, requiring each piece of land to be free of weeds, insects, third-class seedlings, and vacant land. (8) Vigorously carry out "Four-Soilization," and reform and promote 100,000 various tools.

    After this profound debate, the five hundred commune and team cadres enhanced their confidence in the leap forward and found a way. They unanimously proposed: Grasp the first year of the three-year period, and the decisive battle is this year; this year's great leap forward must focus on the present.

    After the meeting, winter production work, mainly focusing on accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy, managing wheat, developing sideline production, and "Four-Soilization," was vigorously carried out. (Attached picture)

    分析形势增加干劲
    措施具体保证跃进
    荫城红旗公社抓紧当前生产力争实现全年规划
    本报太原16日电　长治市荫城红旗人民公社通过群众性的鸣放辩论，更加增强了大伙对1959年全面更大跃进的信心，并且肯定以“八字宪法”作为农业生产再跃进的重要法宝。
    这个公社在1月4日召开生产队长以上的干部会议，讨论制订1959年农业更大跃进计划。会议开始接触到的问题是1959年究竟能不能更大跃进？所有到会的干部，一致公认1958年的巨大成绩，他们说：跃进一年，战果辉煌，工业产值增五培，粮食产量翻一番，这是有眼都看见的。但对1959年能不能更大更好更全面跃进，看法就不完全一致了。有人说：往年增产都是十斤、二十斤，去年翻了一番，真是使尽力啦！有人说：梨树还要隔年歇，土地还能连续大幅度增产？但是许多人不同意这种看法，认为1959年更大的跃进是可能的。经过讨论，大家认识趋于一致。他们总结出1959年八个有利条件是：（一）人民群众的思想获得了进一步的解放，觉悟有了很大提高；（二）各级干部有领导去年大生产的丰富经验；
  （三）农业机器有了增加，去年才七、八部，今年已有了一百二十一部；（四）今年实行了基本农田制，可以集中力量把地种好；（五）公社办起四十七座工厂，可以直接为农业生产服务；（六）水地由去年的一万八千亩，增加到六万五千亩，每人平均有一亩水地；（七）集体福利事业发展了，可以腾出一千多个妇女劳力参加生产；（八）工农商学兵一体，便于组织协作。
    在大家都看清了1959年更大跃进的有利条件后，讨论的焦点又转到“怎样才能更大跃进”的问题上来。根据“不努力完不成，努力就能完成；站起来探不着，跳起来就能探着”的精神，从本社具体条件出发，经过细致分析算账，确定把全社粮食增产计划提高到亩产一千五百斤，比去年增长一倍多。为了把计划放在可靠的基础上，本着“十分指标，十二分措施”的精神，从多方面寻找增产措施。最后一致认为：“八字宪法”就是增产法宝，在党的领导下加强政治思想工作，依靠群众，贯彻“八字宪法”，跃进指标就完全能够实现。他们还作了决定：（一）实现水利化。在现有六万五千亩清洪水地的基础上，进一步进行水利建设，实现全面水利化。（二）大力增施肥料。每亩施肥量在去年三万斤的基础上，增加到六万斤，并要提高质量。贯彻以农家肥为主，土化肥为辅的方针，达到一亩地一口猪，大抓大牲口、猪、羊的管理；全社建立土化肥厂 一百二十五座。（三）全部土地深翻一尺左右，三万亩大面积丰产田要深翻三尺，在四万亩耕地上完成控制水土流失任务。（四）彻底进行种籽革命。玉米全部种金皇后，谷子种红白母鸡咀，山药蛋推广五台白。（五）全部推广密植。玉米每亩植株三千至六千株，谷子每亩植株四至八万株。（六）目前就着手消灭地下虫，实现无虫社。（七）田间管理标准化。70％以上耕地实现园田化，要求块块土地达到无草、无虫、无三类苗、无空地。（八）大搞“四土化”，改革推广各种工具十万件。
    五百名社队干部，经过这场深刻的辩论以后，增强了跃进信心，找到了办法，一致提出：三年抓头年，决战在今年；今年大跃进，必须抓当前。
    会后，以积肥、兴修水利、小麦管理、副业生产、四土化等为主要内容的冬季生产工作，便蓬勃地开展起来了。（附图片）
