Xinhua News Agency, January 21st. Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China Supporting the Soviet Government's Proposal to Convene a Peace Conference to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Germany

                                                                                        January 21, 1959

    On January 10th of this year, the Soviet Government sent notes to our government and the governments of other countries that participated in the war against Germany, proposing that a peace conference be convened within two months, with the governments of countries that sent armed forces to participate in the war against Germany on one side and the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the other side, to discuss and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Government also submitted a draft peace treaty with Germany. This new and positive proposal by the Soviet Government has been warmly welcomed and supported by peace-loving countries and peoples. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports this proposal by the Soviet Government.

    The war against fascist Germany ended nearly fourteen years ago, but a peace treaty with Germany has still not been signed, foreign troops continue to be stationed on German territory, and Western countries maintain an occupation regime in West Berlin. All of this prevents the German people from fully exercising their national sovereignty, maintaining equal relations with other countries, and engaging in effective cooperation. Clearly, this situation is extremely abnormal and unreasonable.

    In order to eliminate this abnormal phenomenon, the Soviet Government has repeatedly proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful settlement of the German question in the postwar years. However, Western countries, especially the United States, have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question and have repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals with various unreasonable excuses. Western countries ignore the objective fact that there are currently two Germanys, do everything possible to obstruct the German people from exercising their sacred right to reunify their motherland, and constantly repeat the so-called "free elections" lies, attempting to achieve the goal of annexing the German Democratic Republic with West Germany. Western countries, especially the United States, have consistently and actively supported West German militarism after the war. Today, West Germany has become the center of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's cold war and a breeding ground for aggressive wars. All of this not only seriously hinders the peaceful settlement of the German question but also greatly threatens European and world peace. In view of the Western countries' repeated unreasonable delays in resolving the German question, the Soviet Government proposed in November of last year that West Berlin be made a demilitarized free city in order to first ease the tense situation in the Berlin region, thereby creating conditions for the peaceful settlement of the German question. However, the Western countries once again rejected all these practical proposals from the Soviet Union.

    Adhering to a consistent position of safeguarding peace and faithful to its obligations to Germany, the Soviet Government once again proposed the signing of a peace treaty with Germany on January 10th of this year. This proposal by the Soviet Government is very reasonable and timely. The realization of this proposal will not only help prevent the resurgence of German militarism and save mankind from the threat of a new war, but also serve as an important guarantee for the German people to engage in peaceful and creative labor as members of the family of nations.

    The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have been making unremitting efforts and enormous contributions to the peaceful reunification of Germany and the safeguarding of European security and world peace. This time, the Soviet Government's proposal to convene a peace conference to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany has been endorsed and supported by the government of the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic has also announced its willingness to hold preliminary negotiations with the West German authorities on the draft peace treaty. All of this once again powerfully proves the sincere desire of the government of the German Democratic Republic for the peaceful reunification of its motherland and the safeguarding of world peace.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people have always supported the efforts made by the German people to peacefully resolve the German question. For the benefit of the Chinese and German peoples, and in line with the desire to safeguard world peace, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China announced as early as April 7, 1955, the end of the state of war between the People's Republic of China and Germany. Based on its consistent position on the German question, the Chinese government, as a member state that participated in the war against German fascism, believes that it has a responsibility to promote the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, in order to facilitate the early realization of a peaceful settlement of the German question. Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of China welcomes and supports the Soviet Government's proposal to convene a peace conference to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany, and agrees with the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Government.

    The facts are very clear, the solution of the German question can no longer be delayed, and the Western countries and the West German authorities must seriously consider this proposal by the Soviet Government. A peace treaty with Germany must be signed, and the German question must be resolved peacefully. If the Western countries and the West German authorities once again unreasonably reject this proposal by the Soviet Government, it can only thoroughly expose their true colors of delaying and obstructing the peaceful settlement of the German question, they will be further severely condemned by all peace-loving people in the world, and they must bear full responsibility for undermining the solution of the German question.

### 我国政府声明支持苏联建议  赞同召开和会缔结对德和约

    我国政府声明支持苏联建议  赞同召开和会缔结对德和约
    新华社21日讯　中华人民共和国政府支持苏联政府关于召开和会讨论和缔结对德和约的建议的声明
　　　　　　一九五九年一月二十一日
    今年1月10日苏联政府向我国政府和其他参加对德战争的国家的政府发出照会，建议在两个月内召开曾派武装部队参加对德战争的国家的政府为一方和以德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府为另一方的和会，来讨论和缔结对德和约。苏联政府并且提出了对德和约草案。苏联政府的这项新的积极建议获得了爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和支持。中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联政府的这项建议。
    反对法西斯德国的战争已经结束将近十四年了，对德和约仍然没有签订，在德国的领土上继续驻有外国军队，西方国家在西柏林还保持着占领制度。这一切就使德国人民无法完全行使自己的国家主权，同其他国家保持平等关系，并且进行有成效的合作。显然，这种情况是极端不正常和不合理的。
    苏联政府为了消除这种不正常的现象，在战后的年代里，曾经多次向美、英、法三国政府提出关于缔结对德和约以及和平解决德国问题的建议。但是，西方国家，特别是美国，对于和平解决德国问题毫无诚意，屡次用种种无理借口拒绝了苏联的合理建议。西方国家无视目前存在着两个德国这一客观事实，千方百计地阻挠德国人民行使统一祖国的神圣权利，并且不断重复所谓“自由选举”的谰言，企图达到以西德吞并德意志民主共和国的目的。西方国家，特别是美国，在战后一贯积极扶植西德的军国主义。今天，西德已经成为北大西洋公约组织进行冷战的中心和制造侵略战争的温床。这一切，不但严重阻碍德国问题的和平解决，而且大大威胁着欧洲和世界和平。鉴于西方国家一再无理拖延德国问题的解决，苏联政府在去年11月提出了关于使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市的建议，以便首先缓和柏林地区的紧张局势，从而为和平解决德国问题创造条件。但是，西方国家又一次拒绝了苏联的这一切实可行的建议。
    苏联政府本着一贯维护和平的立场，忠于对德国所承担的义务，今年1月10日再次提出签订对德和约的建议，苏联政府的这项建议是非常合理和适时的。实现这项建议，不仅有助于防止德国军国主义的再起，使人类免受新战争的威胁；同时，也是使德国人民作为各国人民大家庭中的一员，而从事和平和创造性劳动的重要保证。
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民一直为和平统一德国、维护欧洲安全和世界和平进行着不懈的努力，并且作出了巨大的贡献。这次苏联政府提出关于召开和会讨论并签订对德和约的建议，得到了德意志民主共和国政府的赞同和支持。德意志民主共和国政府并且宣布，愿意同西德当局就和约草案举行预备性的谈判。这一切再一次有力地证明了德意志民主共和国政府的和平统一祖国和维护世界和平的真诚愿望。
    中华人民共和国政府和中国人民一向支持德意志人民为和平解决德国问题所作的努力。为了中国人民和德国人民的利益，本着维护世界和平的愿望，中华人民共和国主席早在1955年4月7日就已宣布结束中华人民共和国同德国之间的战争状态。基于对德国问题的一贯立场，中国政府作为曾经是参加反对德国法西斯战争的成员国，认为自己有责任促成对德和约的签订，以利于早日实现德国问题的和平解决。因此，中华人民共和国政府欢迎和支持苏联政府关于召开和会讨论并签订对德和约的建议，并同意苏联政府提出的对德和约草案。
    事实十分清楚，德国问题的解决已经不容再拖延了，西方国家和西德当局必须认真对待苏联政府的这项建议。对德和约必须签订，德国问题必须和平解决。如果西方国家和西德当局再次无理拒绝苏联政府这项建议，只能彻底暴露出它们拖延和阻挠和平解决德国问题的真面目，它们必将进一步遭到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的严厉谴责，并且必须对破坏德国问题的解决负全部责任。
