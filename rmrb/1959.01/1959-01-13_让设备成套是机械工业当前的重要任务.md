    In 1958, China's mechanical industry experienced a leap forward, now capable of manufacturing and supplying most of the equipment needed for capital construction. This marks a new stage where China's mechanical industry has shifted from primarily repair and assembly to manufacturing. In addition to the rapid growth in quantity, there has also been significant development in variety. The production of some heavy, large, and precision machinery has begun, indicating a substantial improvement in the technical level of China's mechanical industry. However, due to the relatively short time we have been engaged in large-scale machinery manufacturing and the lack of sufficient experience, there are still some weak links in production. The most significant is the lack of complete sets of main engines, auxiliary machines, accessories, and spare parts for some products. Machinery without complete sets is useless and cannot be quickly put into production and realize investment benefits. This is a very important new issue, as it not only relates to the tasks of the mechanical industry itself but also affects the production and construction of various sectors of the national economy. It can be said that it directly affects China's construction speed. Therefore, strengthening equipment matching and ensuring that various mechanical equipment are put into production in complete sets in a timely manner to quickly play their role is a pressing and important task at present.
    When tackling a task, one must focus on the main links. Once the main links are resolved, the entire work can be greatly improved. Currently, the mechanical industry has two main links: one is to comprehensively arrange production, and the other is to ensure complete sets of equipment. In 1959, the needs of various sectors of the national economy for mechanical equipment will greatly increase compared to 1958. In order to successfully achieve this year's grand leap forward targets, the mechanical industry must properly arrange production and carefully prioritize production tasks according to the urgency of demand. We should prioritize equipping the "marshals" and "pioneers," ensuring the production of rolling mill equipment, mining equipment, transportation equipment, power station equipment, and machine tools. The focus cannot be separated from the general, so it is also necessary to make corresponding rational arrangements for the mechanical equipment necessary for other aspects, so that various sectors of the national economy can develop in a planned and proportional manner. After solving the production arrangement problem, the main link should be to focus on the complete set production of equipment. By breaking through this link, our mechanical industry will rise to a new level.
    The construction of any industrial or mining enterprise, whether it is metallurgy, machinery, power station, or coal mine, petroleum, chemical, or building materials enterprise, requires equipment that can be roughly divided into two major categories: one is the equipment on the production line, which is the main equipment of the industrial and mining enterprise; the other is the equipment that plays a supporting role in production, which is the auxiliary equipment of the industrial and mining enterprise. Without auxiliary equipment, the entire factory cannot operate normally, or even cannot be put into production at all. Therefore, in the production of mechanical equipment, it is necessary to grasp the complete set production of various main equipment and the production of various auxiliary equipment, down to a single screw, both of which are indispensable. Taking power generation equipment as an example, a set of 6,000-kilowatt thermal power generation equipment has more than 7,000 accessories surrounding the main equipment such as turbines, boilers, and generators, of which more than 4,000 are relatively complex. The labor of the accessories of power generation equipment often exceeds more than twice that of the main engine. From this, we can see that equipment matching is an extremely large and complex task, which is both an important task of the machinery manufacturing department and a task of the capital construction department.
    Since making complete sets of equipment has become a pressing and important task in the current industrial construction, how can we effectively complete this task? The first is to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of walking on two legs, mobilizing central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, enterprises in the mechanical industry department and enterprises in other industrial departments, that is, mobilizing the mechanical manufacturing forces of all parties, giving full play to the potential of enterprises, and jointly serving the matching of various equipment. Any complete set of production equipment is the product of the division of labor and cooperation of many enterprises. In a complete set of equipment for a factory, there are main and auxiliary components, simple and complex product structures, and easy and difficult manufacturing technologies. Therefore, these machines and equipment can certainly be produced by large enterprises using foreign methods, but there are also many products that can be produced by small enterprises using indigenous methods, or by large, medium, and small enterprises in collaboration, using both foreign and indigenous methods. In 1958, in order to have the whole people run iron and steel, in a very short period of time, a large number of foreign equipment and indigenous equipment of different specifications and models were produced all over the country. Various blast furnaces, converters, blowers, and motors were continuously supplied from large, medium, and small enterprises to the iron and steel front in batches and complete sets, which effectively guaranteed the task of doubling steel production. This is an important practice of combining a mass movement of large enterprises and foreign method production (large foreign group) with a mass movement of small enterprises and indigenous method production (small indigenous group) in equipment manufacturing. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is a large enterprise with a modern level, and it is produced by foreign methods. However, the "Liberation" brand automobiles it produces, in addition to the main body being manufactured by itself, also have five or sixty enterprises in ten provinces and cities across the country manufacturing parts and components for it, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises. These facts eloquently illustrate that it is not only necessary but also entirely possible to walk on two legs in equipment matching. In this regard, any idea that neglects the "small indigenous group" is incorrect.
    In order to do a good job in equipment matching, it is also necessary to guarantee the need for equipment matching from the perspective of plan arrangement. Having a guideline means having a list of items, highlighting key points while making comprehensive arrangements. This applies to the relationship between various sectors of the entire national economy, and it must also apply to each industrial sector internally. Within the mechanical manufacturing industry, there should be comprehensive and rational arrangements between various products, such as ironmaking and steelmaking equipment and rolling mill equipment, machinery and electrical machinery, main equipment and auxiliary equipment, and various machines and equipment and the required accessories, etc. The key to the so-called comprehensive and rational arrangement lies in grasping the key points with great effort while paying attention to the general, so that the guideline leads to a clear list of items. When arranging production plans and allocating raw materials, it is necessary to take care of both the main equipment and the accessories and auxiliary equipment, arranging plans in complete sets and allocating raw materials in complete sets. All departments, enterprises, and capital construction units should immediately make reasonable adjustments to the 1959 production plan and capital construction plan in accordance with the matching relationship. Materials manufacturing departments should do their best to increase production and develop varieties as quickly as possible to ensure complete supply to the needs of the machinery manufacturing department.
    With the correct policy and plan for complete set production, it is also necessary to further strengthen production collaboration to ensure that matching products have a relatively fixed source. The fact that the industrial leap forward in 1958 tells us that strengthening the leadership of production collaboration, promoting the spirit of communist collaboration, and strictly fulfilling production collaboration contracts are the key to ensuring complete sets of equipment. In order to solve the matching problem of main equipment, some factories that originally produced collaborative products for matching but changed their product plans in last year's great leap forward should return to the team, or at least extract a considerable part of their strength to manufacture the original collaborative products. If some accessories factories have produced other products and cannot return to the team, it is also necessary to properly arrange other small factories to engage in accessories production and reorganize and strengthen production collaboration relations. Every enterprise that undertakes collaborative tasks must formally include the collaborative tasks in the plan and ensure that they are completed on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity. Once the production collaboration relationship is determined, it should not be changed without authorization, so as not to affect the whole. Past experience shows that the key to whether collaboration is good or not lies in whether the idea of collaboration is established and whether the relationship between the whole and the part is placed in the correct position. With the continuous development of socialist construction, there will be more and more collaborative production in the future, and whether the collaboration is good or not will directly affect the speed of construction. Therefore, we must treat collaborative tasks seriously and conscientiously in the spirit of communism.
    At present, the development of China's mechanical industry is still uneven, and many main equipment can only be organized into complete sets within the scope of the whole country. However, in order to give full play to the existing mechanical manufacturing capacity of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions and to facilitate the organization of production, complete set production should be organized within a province, municipality, or autonomous region as much as possible under the principle of combining mobilizing the initiative of all parties and coordinating all activities of the nation as in a chess game. For complete sets of equipment that cannot be completed in a province, municipality, or autonomous region, the large collaboration zone organizes other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the large zone to collaborate in manufacturing. The collaborative tasks between large collaboration zones and the matching products that need to be balanced nationwide are the responsibility of the central competent department to balance. In the process of implementation, with the continuous development of industrial construction, the types of equipment that can be self-contained in each province, municipality, and autonomous region will be gradually expanded, and the items of products that are balanced nationwide will be reduced. This has a major positive effect on promoting the rapid development of the national mechanical industry. All localities should quickly formulate measures to organize matching production.
    Matching work in equipment manufacturing and supply is one of the keys to achieving a greater leap forward in this year's industry. Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, rely on the masses, and conduct in-depth publicity and education work among all employees to establish a global perspective, obey the overall interests, and conscientiously implement the production plan for equipment matching. At the same time, they should immediately conduct an inspection of the matching work. Specialized equipment matching agencies at all levels should be established immediately to take charge of the work of matching production, and constantly summarize experience and improve work, so that the mechanical industry can pass the test of equipment matching and further improve the level of China's mechanical industry.

    让设备成套是机械工业当前的重要任务
    1958年，我国的机械工业有了飞跃的发展，已能制造供应基本建设所需要的绝大部分设备，这标志着我国的机械工业已经由修配为主走上了以制造为主的新阶段。除了数量上的急剧增长以外，在品种上也有了很大的发展，一些重型、大型、精密的机械已经开始生产，这标志着我国机械工业的技术水平，也有了很大的提高。但由于我们进行大规模的机械制造的时间还短，经验还不够，生产中还存在一些薄弱环节，其中最主要的是某些产品的主机、辅机和附件、配件互不成套。机械不成套，就无用武之地，不能迅速投入生产和发挥投资效果。这是一个十分重要的新问题，因为它不仅关系到机械工业本身任务，并且会影响国民经济各部门的生产建设，也可以说，它直接影响到我国的建设速度。因此加强设备配套工作，使各种机械设备及时成套地投入生产，迅速发挥作用，是当前一个迫切的重要任务。
    抓工作要抓主要环节，主要环节迎刃而解，整个工作就可以大大提高一步。当前机械工业有两个主要环节，一是全面地安排生产，一是让设备成套。1959年，国民经济各部门对机械设备的需要比1958年大大增加。为了胜利实现今年宏伟的跃进指标，机械工业必须妥善安排生产，根据需求的轻重缓急，对生产任务作仔细的排队。应当把武装“元帅”和“先行”作为重点，保证轧钢设备、矿山设备、交通运输设备、电站设备和机床的生产。重点不能脱离一般，因此也必须同时对其他方面所必需的机械设备作相应的合理安排，以使国民经济各部门都能有计划按比例地发展。在解决了生产安排问题之后，主要一环应当抓设备的成套生产。突破了这一环，我们的机械工业又将上升到一个新的水平。
    任何一个工矿企业的建设，无论是冶金、机械、电站，也无论是煤矿、石油、化工及建筑材料企业，它们所需要的设备，大体说来可以分为两个大类：一类是生产作业线上的设备，这是工矿企业的主要设备；一类是起配合生产作用的设备，这是工矿企业的辅助性设备。只有主要设备，而无辅助设备，整个工厂仍然不能正常生产，甚至根本不能投入生产。因此，在机械设备的生产中，既要抓紧各种主要设备的成套生产，又要抓紧各种辅助设备的生产，直至一个螺丝钉，两者缺一不可。以发电设备来说，一套六千瓩的火力发电设备，围绕着汽轮机、锅炉、发电等主要设备的附件，共有七千多件，其中比较复杂的有四千多件。发电设备的附件的劳动量往往超过主机的一倍以上。从这里可以看到设备配套是一件极其庞大和复杂的工作，它既是机械制造部门的重要任务，同时也是基本建设部门的任务。
    让设备成套既然已成为当前工业建设中一个迫切的重要的任务，怎样才能有效地完成这个任务呢？首先就是坚决贯彻执行党中央提出的用两条腿走路的方针，动员中央工业与地方工业，大型企业与中小型企业，机械工业部门企业与其他工业部门的企业，即动员各方面的机械制造力量，充分发挥企业的潜力，共同为各种设备的配套服务。任何一套完整的生产设备，都是许多企业分工协作的产物。一个工厂的全套设备中，有主要辅助之分，产品结构有繁简之分，制造技术有难易之分。因此，这些机器设备，固然可以由大企业用洋法生产，但是也有不少产品可以由小企业用土法生产，或者由大中小企业协作，洋法土法并用。1958年为了全民办钢铁，在一个极短的时间内，全国各地大量地生产了不同规格型号的洋设备和土设备，各种高炉、转炉、鼓风机、电动机从大中小企业中源源不断地、成批成套地供应钢铁战线，有力地保证了钢产量翻一番的任务。这是设备制造上一个大型企业、洋法生产的群众运动（大洋群）同小型企业、土法生产的群众运动（小土群）相结合的重要的实践。第一汽车制造厂是一个具有现代化水平的大企业，是用洋法生产的。但是它所出产的“解放牌”汽车，除了主体部分是自己制造外，还有遍布全国十个省、市的五、六十个企业为其生产配件零件，其中不少都是中小型企业。这些事实雄辩地说明了设备配套工作用两条腿走路不仅是必要的，而且是完全可能的。在这方面，任何忽视“小土群”的思想都是不对的。
    为了做好设备成套的工作，还必须从计划安排上保证设备成套的需要。有纲就要有目，既要突出重点，又要全面安排。整个国民经济各部门之间如此，每一个工业部门内部也必须如此。机械制造工业内部各种产品之间，例如炼铁炼钢设备与轧钢设备之间，机械与电机之间，主要设备与辅助设备之间，以及各种机器设备与所需要的配件之间，等等，都应有全面的合理的安排。所谓全面的合理的安排的关键在于既用大力抓重点，又注意抓一般，这样才能做到纲举目张。在安排生产计划的时候，分配原材料的时候，必须既照顾到主要设备，又照顾到配件和辅助设备，成套地安排计划，成套地分配原材料。各部门各企业和基本建设单位都应该按照配套关系，立即对1959年的生产计划、基本建设计划进行合理的调整。材料制造部门应该尽力以最快速度增加产量、发展品种，保证成套地供应机械制造部门的需要。
    有了正确的成套生产的方针、计划，还必须进一步加强生产协作来保证配套产品有比较固定的来源。1958年工业大跃进的事实告诉我们，加强对生产协作的领导，发扬共产主义协作精神，严格地履行生产协作合同，是保证设备成套的关键。为了解决主要设备的配套问题，原来生产配套用的协作产品而在去年大跃进中改变了产品方案的工厂，有些还要归队，至少要抽出相当一部分力量制造原来的协作产品。有些配件厂已生产其他产品不能归队的，也必须妥善地安排其他小厂搞配件生产，重新整顿和加强生产协作关系。每一个担负协作任务的企业，都必须把协作任务正式列入计划，并保证按质按量按期地完成。生产协作关系既经确定，就不应擅自变动，以免牵动整体。以往的经验说明：协作得好不好，关键在于是否树立起协作的思想，是不是把整体和局部的关系放在正确的位置上。随着社会主义建设不断发展，今后协作生产将越来越多，协作得好不好，将直接影响到建设的速度，因此我们必须严肃认真地以共产主义的精神对待协作任务。
    目前，我国机械工业的发展还不平衡，许多主要设备还只能在全国范围内组织成套。但是，为了充分发挥各省、市、自治区现有的机械制造能力和便于组织生产，应当在调动各方面的积极性和全国一盘棋相结合的原则下，尽量在一省、市、自治区内组织配套生产。在一个省、市、自治区无法完成的成套设备，由大协作区组织大区内其他省、市、自治区协作制造。大协作区之间的协作任务和需要在全国范围内平衡的配套产品，由中央主管部门负责平衡。在执行过程中，随着工业建设的不断发展，逐步地扩大各省、市、自治区自行成套的设备种类，缩小全国平衡的产品项目，这对促进全国机械工业的迅速发展有着重大的积极作用。各地都应当迅速制订措施，组织配套生产。
    设备制造和供应中的配套工作，是实现今年工业中更大跃进的关键之一。各级党委应当加强领导，坚持政治挂帅，依靠群众，向全体职工进行深入的宣传教育工作，树立全局观点，服从整体利益，认真执行设备配套的生产计划，同时，立即对配套工作进行一次检查。各级的设备配套专管机构应当立即设立，把配套生产的工作抓起来，并且不断地总结经验，改进工作，使机械工业过好设备配套这一关，进一步提高我国机械工业的水平。
