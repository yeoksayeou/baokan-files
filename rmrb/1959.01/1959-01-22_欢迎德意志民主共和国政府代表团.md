    Welcome the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic
    The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, will arrive in Beijing today for a friendly visit to our country. Our people are very excited and warmly welcome the arrival of the envoys of the fraternal German people. This visit is a major event in the relations between China and Germany. It will further consolidate and develop the friendly cooperation between our two countries and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The German Democratic Republic and our country are close members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people have always had the deepest friendship with the people of the German Democratic Republic. The friendly relations between our two countries are based on the proletarian internationalist principles of mutual respect and mutual assistance. We both unswervingly follow the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and the fundamental interests and goals of our two peoples are completely consistent. This ensures that we carry out close cooperation in the common struggle and give each other sincere support.
    In recent years, the friendly relations between China and Germany have greatly developed. Three years ago, Prime Minister Grotewohl paid his first visit to our country. That visit achieved significant results and concluded the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with our government, which became an important milestone in the development of comprehensive friendly cooperation between our two countries. Over the past three years, as stipulated in the treaty, our two countries have developed friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields in the spirit of sincere cooperation and fraternal unity. During this period, mutual visits by many delegations have enhanced the friendship and understanding between the peoples of our two countries. Our friendly cooperation is gradually expanding and deepening into many important aspects of the lives of the two peoples, and has achieved increasingly remarkable results. The Chinese people have received sincere support and assistance from our German brothers. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have actively supported our people's struggle against US imperialism's occupation of our territory, Taiwan. The industrial equipment supplied by the German Democratic Republic to our country and the technical assistance given to our country are one of the important factors for our country to accelerate socialist construction. We deeply thank the people of the German Democratic Republic for this brotherly and sincere support and assistance to our people.
    Our two countries are two fraternal countries in the socialist camp that were born in the same year and month. This year, we will both celebrate the tenth anniversary of our founding. These ten years have been ten years of rapid growth in the strength of our two countries and the entire socialist camp. Due to the vigorous development of socialism and the cause of world peace, the balance of world forces has undergone a fundamental change that is favorable to the socialist forces. When welcoming the distinguished guests from the German Democratic Republic, we look back at the victorious path jointly experienced by China and Germany in the past ten years and are full of confidence in the future of peace and socialism.
    The Chinese people have always been concerned about the construction cause of the German Democratic Republic. The people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved brilliant achievements on the road of building socialism. Socialist industrial production centered on heavy industry has grown rapidly, the socialist transformation of agriculture has continued to advance, culture and art have flourished universally, and great achievements have been made in the development of modern science and technology. The living standards of the working people have continued to improve. These achievements have greatly consolidated and strengthened the strength of the German Democratic Republic, making it an important factor in safeguarding European security and world peace. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the people of the German Democratic Republic have established the foundation of socialism in a relatively short period of time. On this basis, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held last summer, put forward new goals for the people of the whole country: by 1961, the German Democratic Republic will catch up with and exceed West Germany in terms of per capita consumption of all important food and consumer goods. The working people of the German Democratic Republic have enthusiastically responded to this call and are striving to achieve this great goal in the short term. The new achievements of the German Democratic Republic have greatly encouraged and strengthened the enthusiasm and confidence of our people in building socialism.
    While carrying out socialist construction, the German Democratic Republic has been committed to safeguarding world peace and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic has made outstanding contributions to the struggle for realizing European collective security and easing international tensions, and in promoting the economic upsurge of socialist countries and developing economic and cultural ties with countries around the world. The party and people of the German Democratic Republic have waged a resolute struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism.
    The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have made unremitting efforts to peacefully resolve the German question. Recently, the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly issued statements supporting the Soviet government's proposal to make West Berlin a demilitarized free city and the proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Comrade Ulbricht reiterated the proposal to establish a German confederation. This desire and effort of the German Democratic Republic has been supported by all peace-loving countries and people. The international connections of the German Democratic Republic are developing day by day, and its international status is constantly improving. The achievements made by Prime Minister Grotewohl's visit to several Asian and African countries are proof of the expansion of the international influence of the German Democratic Republic.
    The Chinese people firmly support all efforts made by the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic to peacefully resolve the German question. The Chinese government's statement in support of the Soviet government's proposal on the German peace treaty once again reflects the firm and unwavering position of the entire Chinese people. Our government and people believe that ending the division of Germany and restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis is an irresistible objective requirement of historical development. The attempt by the imperialist group and the Adenauer government to continue to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the German question will encounter increasing difficulties and will eventually fail. We firmly believe that with the resolute struggle of the German people and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the German nation will eventually be united into a peaceful, democratic, and independent country.
    When welcoming the distinguished guests from the German Democratic Republic, we wish this visit a complete success. We firmly believe that through this visit, the friendly cooperative relationship between the people of China and Germany will be further consolidated and developed. (Attached picture)

    欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团
    以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，将在今天到达北京，对我国进行友好访问。我国人民怀着十分兴奋的心情，热烈欢迎兄弟德国人民的使者的光临。这次访问是中德两国关系中的一件大事，它将进一步巩固和发展我们两国之间的友好合作，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。
    德意志民主共和国和我国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的亲密的成员。我国人民对德意志民主共和国人民一向怀着最深厚的友情。我们两国的友好关系是建立在互相尊重、互相帮助的无产阶级国际主义原则的基础之上的。我们都坚持不渝地遵循着马克思列宁主义的原则，我们两国人民的根本利益和奋斗目标是完全一致的。这就保证我们在共同的斗争中进行亲密无间的合作，相互给予真诚的支持。
    几年来，中德两国之间的友好关系有了很大的发展。三年以前，格罗提渥总理曾经到我国进行过第一次访问。那次访问获得了重大的成果，和我国政府缔结了中德友好合作条约，成为我们两国发展全面的友好合作关系重要的里程碑。三年来，正如条约所规定的，我们两国本着真诚合作和兄弟团结的精神，发展了政治、经济、文化的友好合作关系。在此期间，许多代表团的相互访问，增进了我们两国人民之间的友谊和了解。我们的友好合作正在逐步扩大和深入到两国人民生活的许多重要方面，并且取得了越来越显著的成绩。我国人民得到了德国兄弟的真诚的支持和援助。德意志民主共和国的政府和人民积极支援了我国人民反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争。德意志民主共和国供应我国的工业装备和给予我国的技术援助，是我国加速社会主义建设的重要因素之一。我们深深感谢德意志民主共和国人民对我国人民这种兄弟般的真诚的支持和援助。
    我们两国是社会主义阵营中同年同月诞生的两个兄弟国家，今年我们都将欢庆建国的十周年。这十年是我们两国和整个社会主义阵营力量迅速壮大的十年。由于社会主义和世界和平事业的蓬勃发展，世界力量的对比发生了有利于社会主义力量的根本的变化，在欢迎德意志民主共和国贵宾的时候，我们回顾过去十年来中德两国所共同经历的胜利道路，对和平和社会主义事业的前景充满着信心。
    中国人民一向关怀着德意志民主共和国的建设事业。在建设社会主义的道路上，德意志民主共和国人民获得了辉煌的成就。以重工业为中心的社会主义工业生产迅速增长，农业社会主义改造事业不断进展，文化艺术普遍繁荣，在发展现代科学技术中也获得很大的成果，劳动人民生活水平不断提高。这些成就大大地巩固和增强了德意志民主共和国的力量，使它成为保障欧洲安全和世界和平的重要因素。在德国统一社会党的领导下，德意志民主共和国人民已在较短的时期内建立了社会主义的基础。在这个基础上，去年夏天举行的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，又向全国人民提出了新的奋斗目标：到1961年，德意志民主共和国将在所有重要食品和消费品的消费量方面按人口平均赶上并超过西德。德意志民主共和国劳动人民热烈响应这个号召，正为在短期内实现这个伟大的目标而奋斗。德意志民主共和国的新成就，大大地鼓舞和增强了我国人民建设社会主义的热情和信心。　
    在进行社会主义建设的同时，德意志民主共和国一直致力于维护世界和平和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结的事业。德意志民主共和国在争取实现欧洲集体安全、缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中，在促进社会主义阵营各国经济高涨和发展同世界各国的经济文化联系方面都作出了卓越的贡献。德意志民主共和国的党和人民为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和反对现代修正主义，进行了坚决的斗争。
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民为和平解决德国问题作了坚持不懈的努力。最近，德意志民主共和国政府接连发表声明，支持苏联政府关于使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的建议和缔结对德和约的建议。在德国统一社会党中央全会第四次会议上，乌布利希同志又重申了关于建立德意志邦联的主张。德意志民主共和国的这种愿望和努力，受到了所有爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。德意志民主共和国的国际联系正在日益发展，国际地位正在不断提高。格罗提渥总理这次访问几个亚非国家所获得的成就，就是德意志民主共和国的国际影响扩大的证明。
    中国人民坚决支持苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府为和平解决德国问题所作的一切努力。我国政府支持苏联政府关于对德和约问题建议的声明，又一次反映出了全体中国人民的这种坚定不移的立场。我国政府和人民认为，结束德国的分裂状态，在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，这是历史发展的不可抗拒的客观要求。帝国主义集团和阿登纳政府要想继续阻挠德国问题和平解决的企图，将会遇到越来越大的困难，并且最后一定要失败。我们坚信在德国人民的坚决斗争和全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，德意志民族最后一定会统一成为一个和平、民主、独立的国家。
    在欢迎德意志民主共和国贵宾的时候，我们预祝这次访问的圆满成功。我们深信，通过这次访问，中德两国人民的友好合作关系将获得进一步的巩固和发展。（附图片）
