Minister of Interior, Brigadier General Yahya, said in his speech that the Army serves the people. "Despite powerful forces hindering it, despite these forces plotting various conspiracies against the Army," it refuses to engage in anti-people activities.

Assistant Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Shakir Shukri, said that the Iraqi Army is now equipped with the latest weapons, which our friends have given us without any conditions attached.

He pointed out that the Iraqi Army has many powerful factors, the most important of which is its strong unity with the people.

Colonel Mahdawi, President of the Iraqi Military Tribunal, said in his speech that the Iraqi Army serves the people, although imperialism and its running dogs hope that it will become a tool for suppressing the Iraqi national liberation movement.
