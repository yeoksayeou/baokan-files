An elementary school has been established in the Tanggula mountain region, known as the "Roof of the World," at an altitude of 4,500 to 5,000 meters above sea level. On the 10th, eighty-one lively Tibetan boys and girls, wearing new clothes, participated in the opening ceremony. Their parents—herdsmen who had recently joined the commune—also happily attended the event. Jia Yang (Tibetan), secretary of the CPC Tanggula Working Committee, went to the school to congratulate the students and parents. He said that with the establishment of the People's Commune, the nomadic life of following water and grass will gradually be replaced by settled grazing, and the children of herdsmen will have the opportunity to attend school and study in a stable environment.

The Tanggula mountain region is located at the junction of Qinghai and Tibet. This Tibetan elementary school is located in the Wuli area along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Although the altitude here is very high, the water and grass are lush, and the climate is relatively mild. Since the establishment of the People's Commune in the Tanggula mountain region, it has gradually developed into a settlement for Tibetan herdsmen.

The talented Tibetan children sang and danced at the opening ceremony, praising the People's Commune and celebrating their stable learning life.

    “世界屋脊”上办起小学校
    号称“世界屋脊”的拔海四千五百公尺到五千公尺的唐古拉山区办起了第一所学校。10日，八十一个活泼的藏族男女儿童，穿着新衣参加了开学典礼。他们的爸爸妈妈——不久前加入公社的牧民也高兴地参加了这个盛会。中共唐古拉工委书记加羊
  （藏）到校向学生们和家长们祝贺。他说，人民公社建立，逐水草的游牧将逐步为定居放牧所代替，牧民的孩子都将有机会安定地上学念书了。
    唐古拉山区在青海同西藏的接壤处。这所藏族小学办在青藏公路经过的乌丽地区。这里拔海虽然很高，但水草丰美，气候也比较温和。自从唐古拉山区建立人民公社以来，这里已经逐渐发展成为藏族牧民的一个定居点了。
    能歌善舞的藏族儿童在开学典礼上载歌载舞，歌颂人民公社和欢庆他们安定的学习生活。
