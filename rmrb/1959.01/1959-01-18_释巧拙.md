While advocating for hard work, practical work, and great effort, we also strongly advocate for skillful work. This means we don't approve of clumsy work.

What is skill? What is clumsiness?

I happened to read "Mozi" and "Han Feizi" and found two discussions on skill and clumsiness that were very interesting. I will excerpt and translate them below.

From "Mozi," "Lu Wen" chapter:

Gongshuzi carved bamboo and wood to make a kite that could fly in the sky for three days without falling. Gongshuzi thought this was the most skillful thing. Mozi said to Gongshuzi, "Making a wooden kite is not as good as a craftsman making a linchpin. A craftsman makes a linchpin, and in a short time, he carves three inches of wood to make it; but it can carry fifty dan of weight. So I say: doing things that benefit people is called skill, and doing things that do not benefit people is called clumsiness."

"Han Feizi," "Outer Storehouse Says" also has a passage:

Mozi made a wooden kite, which took three years to complete, but it was destroyed after flying for only one day. His disciples said, "You are so skillful! You can actually make a wooden kite fly." Mozi said:
  "I am not as skillful as the craftsman who makes linchpins! He uses a very small piece of wood and doesn't even need a morning to make a linchpin, which can carry thirty dan of weight, transport things, and can be used for many years. Now I make a wooden kite, which takes three years to make, and it is destroyed after flying for one day!"

These two records are very different. But their expression of Mozi's thought is completely consistent. That is, in Mozi's view: what is beneficial to people and beneficial to production is called skill; what is not beneficial to people and not beneficial to production is called clumsiness. Of course, Mozi's thought has limitations, and here it shows a tendency towards empiricism. He regards the "wooden kite" purely as a useless toy (of course, this is an ideal; people in the Spring and Autumn period could not make a wooden kite that could fly), and does not understand its scientific value; he regards "beneficial to people and beneficial to production" too narrowly, thus despising creative inventions that cannot be used directly and immediately for production. If we put aside this point, then Mozi's idea that what is beneficial to people and beneficial to production is called "skill" and what is not beneficial to people and not beneficial to production is called "clumsiness" is correct. He does not call making a wooden kite "skillful" because it is time-consuming and laborious and has no practical value.

I think that in the current technological revolution, whether or not it is beneficial to production should also be used as the criterion for distinguishing between skill and clumsiness. Of course, here we do not exclude those scientific researches that cannot be directly and immediately used for production; this kind of research work is also very important, and from a long-term perspective, it is even more beneficial to production, and a certain amount of resources must be devoted to it. However, in mass technological innovation, we should focus on practical value. All reforms that are beneficial to production are skillful; those that are greatly beneficial to production are greatly skillful. If we deviate from this point, we will simply pursue novelty, waste labor and money, and even only produce some "toys." For example, if someone makes a wooden car, I think it belongs to this category. Of course, the idea of wanting to create is good, and the enthusiasm is also commendable. However, leaving the production point of view and simply being curious will lead to flashy but impractical results, with more disadvantages than advantages. Even if you come up with some novel "tricks," it will be a small skill but a great clumsiness.

Then, what about carving eighteen arhats on a walnut shell? That is art; that is also beneficial to people and indirectly beneficial to production. But that can only be done by a very small number of people; if everyone carved walnut shells, that would be terrible!

    释巧拙
    何明
    我们在提倡苦干、实干、大干的同时，也大力提倡巧干。这也就是说，不赞成拙干。
    什么叫巧？什么叫拙？
    偶读“墨子”和“韩非子”，看到有两段释巧拙的议论，很有意思。兹将其摘译于下。
    “墨子”“鲁问篇”的一段：
    公输子削竹木做成鸢，能够飞在天空，三日不落。公输子自以为这是最巧了。墨子对公输子说道：“您做木鸢，不如匠人做车辖。匠人做车辖，一会的工夫，削三寸之木就做成了；可是就能载重五十石。所以我说：做事情有利于人就叫作巧，不利于人就叫作拙。”
    “韩非子”“外储说”还有一段：
    墨子做木鸢，三年成功，飞一天就毁了。他的弟子说：“您真是巧啊！竟能使木鸢飞起来。”墨子说：
  “我不如做车辖的匠人巧啊！人家用一块很小的木头用不上一早晨的工夫，做成车辖，就能载重三十石，运输东西，而且可以用好多年。现在我做木鸢，三年做成，飞了一天就毁了啊！”
    这两段记载，很不相同。但对于墨子思想的表述却完全一致。这就是，在墨子看来：有利于人、有利于生产的，才叫作巧；无利于人、不利于生产的，就叫作拙。当然墨子的思想有局限性，在这里表现了经验主义的倾向。他把“木鸢”纯粹是当作一种无益的玩物（当然这是一种理想，春秋时代的人不可能做成飞起来的木鸢），不了解它的科学价值；他把“有利于人，有利于生产”看得太狭窄了一点，因此轻视不能马上、直接用于生产的创造发明。如果撇开这一点不说，那么墨子的有利于人、有利于生产的叫作“巧”，无利于人、无利于生产的叫作“拙”这种思想，则是对的。他不把做木鸢叫做“巧”，就是因为费时费功，而无实用价值。
    我想，在当前的技术革命中，也应该以是否有利于生产作为区分巧和拙的标准。当然，这里我们并不排除那些不能直接和马上用于生产的研究科学；这种研究工作也是很重要的，而且从长远的利益去看，那是更有利于生产的，必须有一定的力量去搞。但是，在群众性的技术革新中，却应该着眼于实用价值这方面。凡是有利于生产的改革，就是巧；大大有利于生产的，就是大巧。如果离开这一点，那就会单纯的追求新奇，费工费财，甚至只弄出一些“玩物”来。譬如，如果有人制造木制汽车，我看就属于这一类。当然，想搞创造的想法是好的，热情也很可嘉。但是，离开生产观点，单纯好奇，就会流于华而不实，弊多利少。这样就是搞出点新奇“名堂”，也是小巧而大拙。
    那么，一个胡桃核上刻十八个罗汉呢？那是艺术；那也是有利于人、间接有利于生产的。但那也只能是极少数人做的事；若是大家都刻起桃核来，那还得了！
