    As the production of small-scale indigenous steel industries moves towards a base and factory-oriented model, with the advancement of agricultural and sideline product procurement, and the continued leap forward in agricultural production, especially after the development of diversified operations by the people's communes, how to manage regional short-distance branch line transportation has become a new and important issue in transportation work. Communes must simultaneously manage short-distance transportation in order to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production, commodity circulation, material collection and distribution, and other economic work.

    Regional short-distance branch line transportation is generally referred to as short-distance transportation. This refers to transportation within the county and by the people's communes. It has the most direct relationship with production and people's lives and is an important link in regional economic work. Within a county, such as the transportation of small-scale steel industrial production bases, field production transportation, transportation between urban areas and various villages, and material collection and distribution between main and branch lines, are all integrated with various aspects of economic work. From a nature perspective, this regional short-distance branch line transportation is both the transportation of the production process and the transportation of the material circulation process. For long-distance main line transportation, it is the gateway for material collection and distribution. If this gateway is not open, whether it is mining areas, furnace sides, or field operations, or whether it is industrial products going to the countryside or agricultural products being transferred out, it will be seriously affected. Because, without short-distance transportation to concentrate goods to railways, waterways, and highway main lines, modern means of transportation will hardly play a role, and even lead to excessive one-way transportation, causing many vehicles and ships to return empty, wasting valuable transportation capacity. And if the goods transported to various places on long-distance main lines are not transferred and distributed to the vast rural areas through short-distance transportation, it will inevitably affect the production and life of rural people. It can be seen that grasping short-distance transportation is a major issue related to the overall situation and should attract everyone's attention.

    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, various places had already begun to pay attention to solving this problem. For example, during the large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement in the countryside last spring, because the transportation work occupied too much manpower, many places quickly realized vehicle-ization to replace human carrying. During the mass steelmaking movement last autumn, due to the inconvenience of mountain transportation, many places organized forces to open mountains and build roads, and initially built steel transportation lines. The leap forward in 1959 is a more magnificent leap forward, with greater production and construction tasks. Short-distance transportation is even more important in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the collection and distribution of materials on main and branch lines. Therefore, it is necessary to make comprehensive arrangements for short-distance transportation to make the material collection and distribution work keep up with the development needs of main line transportation.

    Short-distance transportation has a large volume, wide coverage, and many points. With the increasing development of production, it is necessary to improve or open up transportation lines; comprehensively realize vehicle-ization and ball bearing-ization; between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to build roads and dredge rivers, organize a large number of folk transportation tools, and build vehicles and ships; at material collection and distribution points, it is necessary to expand loading and unloading equipment, and arrange a certain amount of loading and unloading labor. For all these issues, local transportation departments at all levels, especially counties and people's communes, must understand the situation, grasp this link, and adopt effective measures based on the principle of self-reliance to make specific arrangements to manage short-distance transportation well.

    The people's communes managing transportation well is the fundamental way to strengthen short-distance transportation at present. Because the people's commune is the basic-level unit of the combination of workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers in the structure of our socialist society, and at the same time, it is also the basic-level unit of the socialist regime organization, so to implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation, it is necessary to manage the transportation work of this basic-level unit well. And the commune running transportation is to manage the regional short-distance branch line transportation well. Now, various places have already gained good experience in the problem of people's communes running transportation. Transportation departments at all levels should summarize experience in a timely manner, exchange and promote it in a timely manner, and conscientiously grasp short-distance transportation well.

    To grasp short-distance transportation well, it is necessary to organize folk transportation tools. Because under the current conditions in our country, modern means of transportation cannot be increased in large quantities in a timely manner, so short-distance transportation mainly relies on folk transportation tools. These transportation tools have a large quantity, wide distribution, and most of them are suitable for county, township, and mining area branch line travel. Organizing these transportation forces, especially organizing rural vehicles and ships, and investing them in large quantities in short-distance transportation can play a huge transportation role. In the highway freight volume completed by Henan Province last year, more than 90% was completed by folk transportation vehicles. In the waterway freight volume completed by Jiangsu Province last year, wooden sailboats accounted for 85%. At present, there are many tasks in the countryside. Pay attention to unified arrangements when organizing folk transportation tools. Xinjiang County in Shanxi Province, due to the proper arrangement of labor for short-distance transportation, organized more than 3,000 horse-drawn carts and iron-wheeled carts, as well as some freight vehicles of institutions and enterprises, implemented unified command, formed four transportation teams, and arranged them separately to steel bases, between urban and rural areas, between urban areas and steel bases, and field transportation. Because they arranged the use of transportation capacity relatively appropriately, combined the transportation teams of the steel base and the field transportation teams with industrial and agricultural production, and implemented the method of both industry and transportation and both agriculture and transportation, the effect was very good, which was beneficial to both transportation and production, and basically solved the transportation problem of the whole county. This is a good experience.

    To grasp short-distance transportation well, it is necessary to implement planned management. Some people think that transportation is tight and mass movements should be carried out, so planned management cannot be implemented. This view is not comprehensive. It should be said that the faster the productivity advances and the tighter the transportation is, the more necessary it is to have the management of correct transportation plans. Otherwise, not only will it be difficult to transfer general materials, but it will also be difficult to ensure the transportation of important materials. Planned management is not only applicable to modern means of transportation, but also applicable to folk transportation tools. If there is no plan for short-distance transportation, it will inevitably make it impossible for long-distance main lines to obtain timely sources of goods according to plan. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate short-distance transportation into the track of planned management. For material transfer, it is necessary to implement material queuing from a global perspective and arrange transportation plans; it is necessary to implement the principle of first transferring out and then transporting in; material collection and distribution must closely combine long-distance and short-distance transportation; transportation scheduling must implement "five determinations," that is, determining lines, determining points, determining times, determining quantities, and determining tools. The benefits of implementing planned management are not only that the entire transportation system can operate in coordination and connect with each other, but also that it adapts to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation. Huanghe People's Commune in Kaifeng County, Henan Province, has implemented the method of combining transportation work with various aspects, which is worthy of attention from various places. Because the Party committee strengthened the leadership of transportation work, it adopted the methods of combining transportation with production, combining long-distance with short-distance, combining modern tools with folk transportation tools, and combining higher-level business departments with lower-level business departments, which not only completed the national transportation tasks, but also completed the transportation tasks of the commune. This is an experience of running transportation from a global perspective and should be promoted.

    To grasp short-distance transportation well, it is necessary to carry out technological revolution. At present, the technological revolution of short-distance transportation lies first in promoting semi-mechanization and indigenous mechanization. In the steel base area, a road network should be constructed according to natural geographical conditions, and vehicle-ization, rail-ization, chutes, cableways, etc. should be implemented; in areas where conditions permit, highways can also be built to the steel base. In terms of field transportation, ball bearing-ization should be realized on the basis of vehicle-ization last year; in places where vehicle-ization has not yet been realized, the transportation method of human carrying should be quickly changed, and vehicle-ization or cableway-ization should be realized as soon as possible. In terms of urban and rural transportation, folk transportation tools should be actively improved, changing human power to animal power, changing two wheels to four wheels, and changing oars to rotating propellers; building roads and opening rivers, and building vehicles and ships. At material collection and distribution points, cargo yards should be expanded as soon as possible to accommodate a large amount of cargo storage; indigenous machinery should be developed to replace manual handling; the technical operation of handling should be improved, and loading and unloading labor should be properly arranged. All of this should have a comprehensive plan and be implemented in stages, in order to rapidly improve the capacity of short-distance transportation.

    The greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 has already begun. This year's transportation tasks will definitely increase significantly. The people's communes implement industry and agriculture simultaneously, self-sufficient production and commodity production simultaneously, and the task of short-distance transportation will increase sharply. At the beginning of the year, a full estimate must be made of this development trend. We hope that Party committees in various places will attach importance to short-distance transportation, continue to exert their efforts, strengthen leadership, make comprehensive plans, and make unified arrangements. Actively build rural transportation networks, build roads and bridges, dredge rivers, reform technology, develop vehicle and ship transportation, and manage short-distance transportation well, in order to facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, realize this year's more magnificent leap forward, and accelerate the development of the socialist economy.

    抓好短途运输
    随着小土群钢铁工业生产走向基地化和工厂化，农副产品收购工作的开展，以及农业生产的继续跃进，特别是人民公社发展多种经营以后，如何办好地区性的短途支线运输，在交通运输工作中，已成为一个新的重要的问题。公社要搞好工农业生产和商品流通、物资集散等经济工作，就必须同时办好短途运输。
    地区性的短途支线运输，一般称为短途运输。这是指县境以内的和人民公社的运输。它同生产和人民生活有最直接的关系，是地区经济工作中的一个重要环节。在一个县的地区以内，例如小型钢铁工业生产基地的运输、田间生产的运输、城关与各乡之间的运输，以及干线与支线间物资集散运输等等，都同各方面的经济工作联成一体。这种地区性的短途支线运输，从性质上看，既是生产过程的运输，又是物资流通过程的运输。它对于长途干线运输来说，则是物资集散的关口。如果这一关通不过，不论对矿区、炉边或田间作业，也不论工业品下乡或农产品外调，都会受到严重的影响。因为，如果没有短途运输把货物集中到铁路、水路和公路干线上来，近代运输工具很难发挥作用，甚至会形成过多的单程运送，使许多车船回程空驶，浪费宝贵的运力。而长途干线上运到各地的货物，如果没有短途运输来接转，向广大农村疏运，必然会影响农村人民的生产和生活。可见抓好短途运输，是一个关系全局的大问题，应当引起大家的重视。
    在1958年的大跃进中，各地已经开始注意解决这个问题，例如：去年春季在农村大搞水利积肥运动中，由于运输工作上占用人力过多，许多地方就迅速实现了车子化来代替人挑肩背。去年秋季在全民大炼钢铁的运动中，山区交通不便，许多地方就组织力量，开山修路，初步建设起钢铁运输线来。1959年的跃进是一个更加宏伟的跃进，生产建设的任务更大，在城乡物资交流和干支线的物资集散运输方面，短途运输就显得更加重要，因此必须对短途运输作全面安排，使物资集散工作赶上干线运输发展的需要。
    短途运输量大、面广、点多，随着生产的日益发展，需要改善或开辟交通线路；全面实现车子化和滚珠轴承化；城乡之间需要修路浚河，大量组织民间运输工具并造车造船；物资集散地点，需要扩充装卸设备，并安排一定的装卸劳动力。所有这一切问题，各级地方交通运输部门，特别是县和人民公社，都要摸清底细，抓好这个环节，根据自力更生的原则，采取有效措施，作出具体安排，办好短途运输。
    人民公社办好运输，是目前加强短途运输的根本途径。因为人民公社是我国社会主义社会结构的工农商学兵相结合的基层单位，同时又是社会主义政权组织的基层单位，所以要贯彻实现全党全民办交通的方针，必须办好这个基层单位的交通运输工作。而公社办交通，就是要办好地区性的短途支线运输。现在，人民公社办交通的问题，各地已经取得了较好的经验。各级交通运输部门，应当及时总结经验，及时交流推广，认真地把短途运输抓好。
    抓好短途运输，一定要组织民间运输工具。因为在我国目前的条件下，近代运输工具还不可能及时大量增加，因此短途运输主要依靠民间运输工具。这些运输工具，数量大、分布广，而且大部分适合于县乡和矿区支线行驶。把这些运输力量组织起来，特别是把农村车船组织起来，大量投入短途运输，可以发挥巨大的运输作用。河南省在去年完成的公路货运量中，由民间运输车辆完成的占90％以上。江苏省去年完成的水运货运量中，由木帆船完成的占85％。目前农村中各项任务很多在组织民间运输工具的时候要注意统一安排。山西省新绛县，由于适当安排了短途运输的劳动力，把全县三千多辆马车和铁轮大车，以及一些机关企业货运汽车组织起来，实行统一指挥，组成为四支运输队伍，分别安排到钢铁基地、城乡之间、城关与钢铁基地之间，以及田间运输。由于他们在运力使用上安排得比较恰当，把钢铁基地的运输队伍和田间运输队伍同工农业生产相结合，实行了亦工亦运和亦农亦运的办法，因此效果很好，既利于运输，亦利于生产，基本上解决了全县的运输问题。这是一个好经验。
    抓好短途运输，一定要实行计划管理。有些人认为运输紧张，大搞群众运动，不能实行计划管理。这种看法是不全面的。应该说，愈是在生产力迅速前进、运输紧张的情况下，愈是需要有正确的运输计划的管理。否则，不仅一般物资难以调运，即对重要物资也很难保证运输。计划管理不仅适用于近代运输工具而且也适用于民间运输工具。如果在短途运输上毫无计划，必然会使长途干线上不能按计划获得及时的货源。因此，有必要把短途运输纳入计划管理的轨道。对于物资调运，要以全局观点实行物资排队，安排运输计划；要贯彻先外调、后内运的原则；物资集散，要使长短途运输紧密地结合起来；运输调度，要实行“五定”，即定线、定点、定时、定量、定工具。实行计划管理的好处，还不只是能使整个运输系统协同动作，相互衔接，而且适应工农业生产和商品流转的需要。河南省开封县黄河人民公社已实行了运输工作同各方面结合的办法，值得各地重视。他们由于党委加强了运输工作的领导，采取了运输与生产相结合，长途与短途相结合，近代工具与民间运输工具相结合，上级业务部门与下级业务部门相结合的方法，既完成了国家的运输任务，也完成了公社的运输任务。这是从全局观点出发办运输的经验，应该推广。
    抓好短途运输，一定要开展技术革命。目前短途运输的技术革命，首先在于推行半机械化和土机械化。在钢铁基地方面，应当根据自然地理条件，建设道路网，实行车子化、轨道化、滑槽、索道化，等等；有条件的地区，也可以把公路修到钢铁基地。在田间运输方面，应当在去年实现车子化的基础上，实现滚珠轴承化；还没有实现车子化的地方，要迅速改变人挑肩背的运输方式，尽先实现车子化或索道化。在城乡交通方面，应当积极改善民间运输工具，改人力为畜力，改两轮为四轮，改橹桨为转动推进器；修路开河，造车造船。在物资集散点，要尽快扩建货场，容纳大量货物堆存；发展土机械，代替人力搬运；改进搬运的技术操作，适当安排装卸劳动力。所有这一切，都要有全面规划，分期实现，以便迅速提高短途运输的能力。
    1959年更大更好更全面的跃进已经开始。今年的运输任务肯定要大量增加。人民公社实行工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，短途运输的任务将有急剧的增加。在一年之初，对这种发展趋势，一定要作充分估计。我们希望各地党委都要重视短途运输，继续鼓足干劲，加强领导，全面规划，统一安排。积极建设农村运输网，修路架桥，疏浚河道，革新技术，发展车运船运，办好短途运输，以便利城乡物资交流，实现今年更加宏伟的跃进，加速社会主义经济的发展。
