At Beijing Airport
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Premier Grotewohl, respected comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, comrades, friends:

We are very pleased that the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, has come to visit our country at the invitation of our government at the beginning of this new year. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guests who have come from afar. Three years ago, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, visited our country and left a deep impression on the Chinese people. Today we have the opportunity to welcome them to our country for a friendly visit again, and we feel particularly cordial and happy.

The German Democratic Republic is our brotherly country. There is a deep friendship between our two peoples. Three years ago, the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed by Premier Grotewohl on behalf of the Government of the German Democratic Republic and the Chinese Government laid a solid foundation for strengthening the all-round cooperation between our two countries. The facts of the past three years have proved that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have greatly developed. Now, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Premier Grotewohl, is visiting our country again, which will make greater contributions to further developing the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two countries, to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the noble cause of defending world peace.

Comrades, friends, please allow me to once again extend a warm welcome to Premier Grotewohl and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic.

Long live the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and German people!

Long live the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在北京机场上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的格罗提渥总理同志，敬爱的德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    在这新年开始不久的时候，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团应我国政府的邀请来到我国访问，我们感到非常高兴。我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向远道来访的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。三年以前，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团曾经访问过我国，并且给中国人民留下了深刻的印象。今天我们又有机会欢迎他们到我国进行友好访问，感到特别的亲切和愉快。
    德意志民主共和国是我们的兄弟之邦。我们两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。三年以前，由格罗提渥总理代表德意志民主共和国政府和中国政府所签订的中德友好合作条约，为加强我们两国的全面合作奠定了牢固的基础。三年来的事实证明，我们两国的友好合作关系有了很大的发展。现在以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团再次访问我国，对于进一步发展我们两国之间的兄弟友谊和合作，对于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和保卫世界和平的崇高事业，将会作出更大的贡献。
    同志们，朋友们，请允许我再一次向格罗提渥总理和德意志民主共和国政府代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中德两国人民友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的伟大社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
