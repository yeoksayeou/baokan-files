We in the industrial and commercial circles, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the US imperialists' interference in Cuba's internal affairs and the Belgian colonialists' aggression in suppressing the Congolese people. No one can deny that it is the sacred right of the Cuban people to resolutely punish the Batista henchmen who have committed heinous crimes and are deeply in debt with blood, in order to consolidate the victorious achievements of the people's revolution. No one can deny that it is completely reasonable and just for the Congolese people to launch a struggle for national independence in order to get rid of their impoverished and miserable enslaved status. The US imperialists and Belgian colonialists are not reconciled to their defeat and are carrying out brutal interference and bloody massacres against the Cuban and Congolese people. This is not only hostile to the Cuban and Congolese people, but also to the peace-loving people of the world. We must not tolerate such robbers and butchers.

In the face of such brutal interference and bloody massacres, the Cuban and Congolese people have not been intimidated, but have launched a heroic struggle. The struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people are not isolated. They have won the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world. Therefore, their struggle will surely be victorious, and the US imperialists and Belgian aggressors are destined to suffer a shameful defeat!

Although our country is far away from Cuba and the Congo geographically, we are united in opposing imperialist aggression, opposing colonial rule, and opposing war. The Chinese people, including the industrial and commercial circles, must support the just struggle of the Cuban and Congolese people with the greatest sympathy. We regard the victory of the Cuban and Congolese people as the death knell for all colonialists headed by US imperialism.

The life of imperialism will not be too long. From the struggles of the Cuban and Congolese people, we see that the national independence and liberation movement is developing vigorously with the force of a prairie fire! Victory will surely belong to the Cuban people! Victory will surely belong to the Congolese people! Victory will surely belong to the people of the world who are striving for independence, democracy, and peace!

    人民的胜利　殖民者的丧钟
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通的讲话
    我们工商界和全国人民一道，坚决反对美帝国主义干涉古巴内政和比利时殖民者镇压刚果人民的侵略行为。谁都不能否认，古巴人民坚决惩办罪大恶极、血债累累的巴蒂斯塔党徒来巩固人民革命的胜利成果，是古巴人民神圣的权利。谁都不能否认，刚果人民为了摆脱贫穷悲惨的被奴役的地位，掀起民族独立的斗争，是完全合理的，正义的。美帝国主义和比利时殖民者不甘心于自己的失败，对古巴人民和刚果人民进行横暴干涉和血腥屠杀，这不仅是与古巴人民和刚果人民为敌，也是同全世界爱好和平的人民为敌。我们对这种强盗和屠夫的行为是决不能容忍的。
    在这种横暴干涉和血腥屠杀的面前，古巴人民和刚果人民不但没有被吓倒，而且展开了英勇的斗争。古巴人民和刚果人民的斗争不是孤立的。他们得到全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持，因此，他们的斗争一定会胜利，美帝国主义和比利时侵略者注定要遭到可耻的失败！
    我国同古巴和刚果在地理上虽然相隔很远，但在反对帝国主义的侵略，反对殖民主义的统治，反对战争等方面，我们是心连心的。我国人民包括工商界在内，一定要以最大的同情来支持古巴人民和刚果人民的正义斗争。我们把古巴人民和刚果人民的胜利看作是以美帝国主义为首的所有殖民主义者的死亡的丧钟。
    帝国主义的寿命不会太长了。从古巴人民和刚果人民的斗争中，我们看到民族独立解放运动正以燎原之势在蓬勃发展！胜利一定属于古巴人民！胜利一定属于刚果人民！胜利一定属于全世界争取独立、民主、和平的人民！
