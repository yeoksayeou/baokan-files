Nyasaland, located in southeastern Africa, is a beautiful and fertile country of lakes. The vast Lake Nyasa occupies about a quarter of the country's total area. Nyasaland is mainly agricultural, producing tobacco, tea, cotton, tung oil, rubber, and minerals. Its area is 124,000 square kilometers, about half the size of the United Kingdom. The population is 2.66 million, of which 2.64 million are Africans.

In 1892, Britain forcibly declared Nyasaland a British "protectorate." The local African people rose up to resist British colonial rule, but were not suppressed until 1897. After World War II, in order to strengthen the suppression of the increasingly awakened African people, maintain its colonial rule in this region of Africa, and attempt to link Nyasaland's cheap labor with the mineral resources of neighboring Southern Rhodesia (a British "self-governing territory") and Northern Rhodesia (a British "protectorate"), so as to facilitate the exploitation of Central Africa by British monopoly capital, the British colonialists stepped up their efforts from 1951 to put together Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesia, and Northern Rhodesia into a "Central African Federation." In October 1953, this "Central African Federation" (also known as the "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland") was declared established amidst the protests of the African people. After the establishment of the Federation, the three regions retained their original status, and Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia remained under the British Colonial Office.

Since 1953, the people of Nyasaland and the main political party of Nyasaland, the "African National Congress," have been demanding withdrawal from the Federation and have been persistently struggling against the British colonialists. In September 1953, large-scale demonstrations against the Federation were held throughout Nyasaland, which further developed into riots. In mid-1957, the "African National Congress" and African members of the Nyasaland Legislative Council repeatedly proposed to the British government that Nyasaland withdraw from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and become independent. At the end of October 1958, thousands of people in Nyasaland held political rallies and demonstrations again. The people of Nyasaland are advancing on the road of struggle.

    尼亚萨兰
    位于非洲东南的尼亚萨兰是一个美丽富饶的水乡之国。境内广阔的尼亚萨湖约占去全国面积的四分之一。尼亚萨兰以农业为主，盛产烟草、茶、棉花、桐油、橡胶和矿产。面积为十二万四千平方公里，约等于英国的一半。人口二百六十六万人，其中非洲人占二百六十四万人。
    1892年，英国强行宣布尼亚萨兰为英国的“保护国”，当地非洲人民奋起反抗英国的殖民统治，直到1897年才被镇压下去。第二次世界大战以后，英国殖民者为了加强镇压日益觉醒的非洲人民，维持它在非洲这个地区的殖民统治，同时企图把尼亚萨兰的廉价劳动力和它邻近的南罗得西亚（英国“自治领地”）北罗得西亚（英国“保护国”）的矿藏联系在一起，便于英国垄断资本对中非的压榨，从1951年起，加紧串演把尼亚萨兰和南、北罗得西亚拼凑成一个“中非联邦”。1953年10月这个“中非联邦”（又称“罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦”）在非洲人民的抗议声中宣告成立。联邦成立后，这三个地区都保留其原有地位，尼亚萨兰和北罗得西亚也仍然隶属于英国殖民部。
    1953年以来，尼亚萨兰人民以及尼亚萨兰的主要政党“非洲人国民大会”一直要求退出联邦，对英国殖民者坚持进行斗争。1953年9月，尼亚萨兰全境举行了波澜壮阔的反对联邦的示威，并进而发生了暴动。1957年中，“非洲人国民大会”和尼亚萨兰立法会议非洲籍议员一再向英国政府提出尼亚萨兰退出罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦而独立的要求。1958年10月底，尼亚萨兰数千群众又举行了政治集会和示威。尼亚萨兰的人民正在斗争的道路上前进着。　　　　（新华社）（附图片）
