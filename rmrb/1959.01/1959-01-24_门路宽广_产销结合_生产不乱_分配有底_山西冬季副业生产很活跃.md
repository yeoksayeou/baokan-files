　　Taiyuan, January 23 (From Our Newspaper) – The winter sideline production campaign launched by people's communes in Shanxi Province has initially achieved the effects of invigorating the rural economy, increasing commune accumulation, and raising commune members' income.

　　This year, various regions of Shanxi Province have fully utilized the superior conditions of the people's communes, achieving adaptation to local conditions, making the best use of talents, and making full use of materials, thus opening up a wide range of opportunities. People's communes in mountainous areas focused on developing the mountains, vigorously repairing forests, cutting mountain strips, hunting wild animals, digging medicinal herbs, and collecting wild oil plants; plain areas focused on boiling saltpeter, making alkali, burning bricks and tiles, transportation, weaving, and developing breeding; economic crop areas mainly focused on ginning cotton, pressing oil, opening workshops, and processing agricultural and sideline products. According to the production opportunities and each person's physical condition and production expertise, each commune adopted a professional division of labor method of "the young and strong go out to work, the elderly and women work at home, and technical commune members engage in processing," forming transportation, weaving, processing, and collection groups, giving full play to potential, so that men, women, old and young with auxiliary labor could also be put into production.

　　In production, all regions have paid attention to the integration of production and sales, incorporating sideline production into the national plan, so that production and sales are doubly insured. In order to facilitate the masses in selling their products, Fanshi County organized cadres from the financial and trade system to go deep into the people's communes to establish purchasing points and purchase locally. After the Taiyuan County Production Materials Company and the Trade Company signed contracts with the people's communes, they adopted the method of advance payments to ensure production and sales, so that the commune members could produce with peace of mind.

　　Based on the principle of collective as the mainstay and individual as a supplement, the people's communes in various regions have divided the scope of sideline production and operation between the commune, district, and team, and formulated a production and distribution method of "large collective, small freedom," achieving stable production and guaranteed distribution. The people's commune of Yuci City stipulates that 30% of the net income from large-scale production operated by the collective belongs to the commune, and 70% is handed over to the management district and team. The income from sporadic sideline businesses operated by commune members under the condition that it does not affect collective production belongs entirely to the individual. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the commune members.

　　In this winter's sideline production in Shanxi Province, the commune accumulation and commune members' income have greatly increased, and the living conditions of the commune members have been further improved. According to statistics as of January 2, the average sideline income per household in the province was about eight yuan. People's communes in various regions have stored sufficient fuel in sideline production, solving the problem of winter heating; many commune members have put on new cotton clothes and new cotton shoes.

    门路宽广　产销结合　生产不乱　分配有底
    山西冬季副业生产很活跃
    本报太原23日电　山西省各人民公社掀起的冬季副业生产运动，已初步获得了活跃农村经济、提高公社积累、增加社员收入的效果。
    今年山西省各地充分发挥了人民公社的优越条件，做到因地制宜，人尽其才，物尽其用，广开门路。处在山区的人民公社以开发山区为主，大抓修整林木、割山条、打野兽、刨药材、采集野生油料等；平川地区则抓熬硝、制碱、烧砖瓦、运输、编织，发展饲养等；经济作物区主要是抓轧花、榨油、开作坊、农副产品加工等。各公社根据生产门路和各人体质、生产特长，采取了“青壮年出外干，老年、妇女家里办，技术社员搞加工”的专业分工办法，组成运输、编织、加工、采集等小组，充分发挥了潜力，使具有辅助劳力的男女老少也能投入生产。
    在生产中，各地都注意了产销结合，把副业生产纳入国家计划，使生产销售双保险。繁峙县为了便利群众出售产品，组织财贸系统干部深入各人民公社，建立收购点，就地收购。太谷县生产资料公司、贸易公司和各人民公社签订了合同后，采取预付款的方法，保证了生产和销路，使社员们放心生产。
    各地人民公社本着集体为主，个人为辅的原则，划分了社、区、队的副业生产经营范围，制定了“大集体、小自由”的生产分配办法，做到了生产不乱、分配有底。榆次市人民公社规定集体经营的大型生产纯收入的37％归公社，70％交管理区、队。社员在不影响集体生产的条件下，所经营的零星副业收入，全部归个人。这样大大鼓舞了社员的积极性。
    山西省在今冬副业生产中，公社积累和社员收入已有很大的增加，社员生活也有进一步改善。截至1月2日统计，全省的副业收入每户平均八元左右。各地人民公社在副业生产中贮备了充足的燃料，解决了冬季取暖问题；很多社员穿上了新棉衣、新棉鞋。
