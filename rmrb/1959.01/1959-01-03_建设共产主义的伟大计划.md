    Building the Great Plan for Communism
    Chen Yun
    (Editor's Note: This is an article written by Comrade Chen Yun at the invitation of the editorial department of the magazine "Problems of Peace and Socialism" on the international significance of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. It is published in the first issue of the magazine in 1959.)
    
    In these days, not only in the Soviet Union, not only in the countries of the socialist camp, but also throughout the world, people are widely discussing the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report on "Control Figures for the Development of the Soviet Union's National Economy in 1959-1965" to be presented at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The progressive people of the world are excited and encouraged by the Soviet Union's magnificent plan to build communism, while the reactionary bourgeoisie of the West are "dumbfounded."
    
    The publication of the Seven-Year Plan, as an integral part of the fifteen-year long-term plan for the Soviet Union's construction of communism, marks the entry of the Soviet Union into a new period of great historical significance for all mankind—a period for creating the necessary conditions for the completion of the transition to communism.
    
    Comrade Khrushchev's report outline shows the world the broad road for the Soviet Union to move towards communism. The report outline stipulates that the Soviet Union will develop its industry at an average annual growth rate of 8.6% based on the latest technological and scientific achievements; develop agriculture on the basis of overall mechanization and electrification; vigorously increase the production of daily necessities while giving priority to the development of heavy industry; and while developing the productive forces of the European part of the Soviet Union, pay special attention to the further exploitation of the resources of the eastern regions. In seven years, the socialist productive forces of the Soviet Union will be greatly developed, with the total industrial output value increasing by 80% and the total agricultural output value increasing by 70%. This will prepare sufficient material conditions for continuously increasing the people's welfare and meeting the people's ever-growing material and cultural needs. This is the material foundation for building communism.
    
    The report outline also emphasizes that in order to transition to communism, not only a strong material and technical base is needed, but also a high level of awareness among all citizens of socialist society. In the report outline, Comrade Khrushchev demands: improving the communist consciousness and enthusiasm of the Soviet people, educating the Soviet people in the spirit of collectivism, love of labor, and social responsibility, in the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, and in the spirit of adhering to the high principles of the new social morality; overcoming the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness and launching an irreconcilable struggle against the hostile ideological system of the bourgeoisie; and strengthening the Marxist-Leninist education of state cadres and all Soviet people. These are the indispensable ideological conditions for the transition to communism.
    
    The report outline also stipulates that the education system and national education should be improved and developed in accordance with the principle of "combining education with material production" put forward by Marx and Engels in the "Communist Manifesto". The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that in urban and rural areas, ordinary secondary education should be greatly developed, higher and secondary specialized education through night schools and correspondence courses should be promoted, the network of night schools for workers and rural youth should be expanded, and the system of combining participation in public welfare labor with comprehensive labor technology education and combining learning with participation in work in enterprises, collective farms, or specialized internship factories should be universally implemented in primary and secondary schools, and the network of secondary education schools without separation from production should be greatly expanded. At the same time, further expand and improve the work of training experts with higher education and secondary specialized education. Soviet schools will cultivate people for society who abide by the principles of socialist society, have basic scientific knowledge, can participate in systematic physical labor, and have received multifaceted education.
    
    The report outline also proposes that while further developing social productive forces, socialist relations of production should be improved so that the two forms of socialist ownership—collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people—tend to converge. The measures taken in this regard include: further developing the collective farm system; further organizing industrial enterprises, construction enterprises, and other economic enterprises jointly between collective farms, and jointly building power stations, roads, water conservancy projects, agricultural product processing enterprises and agricultural product storage enterprises, schools, hospitals, clubs, etc.
    
    People can see from the report outline that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will take a series of steps to gradually eliminate the differences between industry and agriculture, city and countryside, and manual and mental labor. These historically significant practices of the Soviet people will surely provide valuable experience for the people of socialist countries who are carrying out socialist construction to move towards communism, and will enrich the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism with these experiences in communist construction.
    
    The magnificent construction scale and the leaping development speed of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan are beyond the reach of all capitalist countries. In the past few decades, Western bourgeois politicians and scholars have ridiculed the Soviet Union's socialist construction plan in every possible way. When the living facts of the Soviet people turned their foolish ridicule into a relentless irony for them, they tried their best to obliterate the great significance of the brilliant achievements of Soviet socialist construction. They once said that the Soviet Union's first five-year plan was a fantasy, but in the years before the Second World War, the Soviet people brilliantly completed two five-year plans ahead of schedule. After the Second World War, they once predicted that the Soviet Union would not be able to heal the wounds of war in the short term, but the Soviet people only used less than five years to not only restore but also surpass the pre-war production level. As a result, bourgeois politicians and scholars again predicted that it would be impossible for the Soviet Union to catch up with Western countries in terms of industrial production output in the short term. After the Soviet Union caught up with and surpassed the most developed capitalist countries in Europe at a leaping speed in terms of the output of major industrial products, they again clamored that although the Soviet Union's production volume might still increase, it would be impossible to catch up with Western countries in terms of per capita output and the people's living standards. Now, people can see from the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan that the predictions of all these spokespersons for monopoly capital are about to go bankrupt.
    
    After the Seven-Year Plan is realized, the Soviet Union will catch up with the most developed capitalist countries in Europe—Britain and West Germany—in terms of per capita industrial output, and surpass the United States in terms of the output of some of the most important industrial products and the per capita output of the most important agricultural products. After 1965, in another five years or so, the Soviet Union's per capita production level will catch up with and surpass the United States. By that time, the Soviet Union will be in first place in the world, both in terms of the absolute quantity of production and in terms of per capita output, and the lives of the Soviet people will reach the highest level in the world. People can clearly see from this plan the vigorous vitality of the newly emerging and thriving socialist system, which has an indisputable superiority over the decaying capitalist system.
    
    The competition between socialism and capitalism is currently taking place on a global scale. The solemn task facing the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is to win time to the maximum extent in this competition. The Soviet Union's magnificent plan to build communism marks the entry of the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism into a decisive stage. As Comrade Khrushchev said in the report outline, "The international significance of the Seven-Year Plan lies in the fact that the completion of this plan means the further strengthening of the power of the socialist world system." The tremendous growth of the Soviet Union's national strength, the center of the socialist camp, and the leaping development of economic construction in China and other socialist countries with the help and mutual support of the Soviet Union, will enable the entire socialist camp to achieve an absolute advantage over the imperialist camp in terms of material production. By the time the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan is realized, the proportion of the total industrial output of the socialist camp in the world's total output will increase from the current 30% to more than 50%. This will be a decisive victory of great historical significance for socialism in the competition of the two systems in the world.
    
    The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the strength of the socialist camp. The Soviet Union is the center of unity of the socialist camp. The strengthening of the Soviet Union's national strength is also the strengthening of the strength of the entire socialist camp. The realization of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan will create more favorable conditions for economic cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries, and promote the common upsurge of economic and cultural construction in socialist countries. The unbreakable unity of the socialist camp, built on common ideals, common interests, and a common ideological foundation, can never be undermined by the shameless provocations of imperialist reactionaries and the despicable sabotage of revisionists. It is quite natural for the people of socialist countries to express their elation at the Soviet people's heroic cause of building communism.
    
    The Soviet Union has always been a staunch flag bearer in safeguarding world peace, national independence, and the cause of human progress. The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy powerfully inspires the people of all countries. The working class and laboring people all over the world see the bright future of mankind from the Soviet Union's magnificent plan to build communism, and their confidence has increased many times over. All countries and peoples who are striving for and safeguarding national independence can easily see that the Soviet people's construction achievements are also a heavy blow to colonialism. All peace-loving people can believe that the strengthening of the Soviet Union's economic and defense forces will make it more difficult for imperialism to launch a new world war. One of the characteristics of our era is that the powerful union of the socialist forces headed by the Soviet Union, the national revolutionary forces, and the peace forces has sufficient strength to prevent the outbreak of a new war. If imperialism dares to risk launching a war, there can be no other result than the complete demise of imperialism.
    
    We Chinese people are carrying out the great socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our country's national economy is developing at a high speed unprecedented in Chinese history. In the struggle for our own socialist construction, the Chinese people have received comprehensive, selfless, fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union, as well as assistance from other socialist countries and the world proletariat. With such a brilliant example as the Soviet Union before us, our people's cause of building socialism is much smoother. Learning from the Soviet Union, conscientiously studying the experience of Soviet socialist construction and communist construction, and creatively applying these experiences in accordance with the characteristics of our own country is our Party's firm policy and an important guarantee for the complete victory of our socialist cause.
    
    Since the great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have always been the vanguard of the international proletariat and laboring people. They have been at the forefront of the world's people, attracting and inspiring the world's people with the brilliant example of building socialism and communism. We Chinese Communists and all Chinese people are very pleased to see that the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev has not only pointed out the specific path for the Soviet people to build communism, but also made great contributions to world peace and the cause of human progress. Now, the great program of building communism put forward by the Central

    建设共产主义的伟大计划
    陈云
    （编者按：这是陈云同志应“和平和社会主义问题”杂志编辑部的邀请，就苏联发展国民经济七年计划的国际意义所写的文章，载该杂志一九五九年第一期。）
    在这些日子里，不仅在苏联国内，也不仅在社会主义阵营各国，而且在全世界，正在广泛地谈论着赫鲁晓夫同志将在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上作的“1959—1965年发展苏联国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲。对于苏联这个建设共产主义的宏伟计划，全世界进步人类莫不为之兴奋鼓舞，而西方资产阶级反动派则为之“瞠目咋舌”。
    作为苏联建设共产主义伟大纲领的十五年远景规划的组成部分的七年规划的公布，标志着苏联正进入一个对于全人类具有伟大历史意义的新时期——为完成向共产主义过渡创造必要条件的时期。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲向全世界展示了苏联走向共产主义的康庄大道。报告提纲规定，苏联将在最新技术和科学的成就的基础上以平均每年增长8.6％的速度发展工业；在全盘机械化和电气化的基础上发展农业；在优先发展重工业的同时大力增加日用品的生产；在发展苏联欧洲部分的生产力的同时，特别注意进一步开发东部地区的富源。在七年内，苏联社会主义生产力将有极大的发展，工业总产值将增加80％，农业总产值将增加70％，这将为不断增进人民的福利和满足人民物质和文化生活的日益增长的需要准备充分的物质条件。这是建设共产主义的物质基础。
    报告提纲又强调指出，为了向共产主义过渡，不仅需要强大的物质技术基础，而且需要社会主义社会全体公民高度的觉悟水平。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告提纲中要求：提高苏联人民的共产主义觉悟和积极性，用集体主义、热爱劳动和社会责任感的精神，用社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义精神，用遵守新社会道德的高度原则精神来教育苏联人民；克服人们意识中资本主义残余并展开对资产阶级的敌对思想体系的不调和的斗争；对国家干部和全体苏联人民加强马克思列宁主义的教育。这是向共产主义过渡的必不可少的思想条件。
    报告提纲还规定，要根据马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”中提出的“教育同物质生产相结合”的原则来改进教育制度和发展国民教育。七年计划规定在城市和乡村地区大大发展普通中等教育，推广夜校和函授的高等和中等专业教育，扩大工人和农村青年的夜校网，在初等和中等学校中普遍实行参加公益劳动同综合劳动技术教育相结合、学习同参加企业、集体农庄或专门实习工厂中的工作相结合的制度，大大扩大不脱离生产的中等教育学校网。与此同时，进一步扩大和改善培养受过高等教育和中等专门教育的专家的工作。苏联的学校将为社会培养遵守社会主义社会的原则、具有基本科学知识、能参加系统的体力劳动、受过多方面教育的人。
    报告提纲还提出，在进一步发展社会生产力的同时，要改善社会主义的生产关系，使两种社会主义所有制——集体农庄所有制和全民所有制趋于接近。在这方面所采取的措施有：进一步发展集体农庄制度；集体农庄之间进一步共同组织工业企业、建筑企业和其他经济企业，共同建设电站、道路、水利工程、农产品加工企业和农产品的储藏企业、学校、医院、俱乐部，等等。
    人们从报告提纲中看到，苏联共产党将采取一系列的步骤，来逐步消除工业和农业、城市和乡村、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。苏联人民的这些有重大历史意义的实践，必将为正在进行社会主义建设的社会主义各国人民提供走向共产主义的宝贵经验，并将以这些共产主义建设的经验丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库。
    苏联七年计划的宏伟的建设规模和飞跃的发展速度，是一切资本主义国家望尘莫及的。西方资产阶级的政客和学者们，在过去的几十年中曾经百般嘲笑苏联的社会主义建设计划。当苏联人民的活生生的事实使他们的愚蠢的嘲笑变为对他们的无情的讽刺之后，他们又千方百计地抹煞苏联社会主义建设的辉煌成就的巨大意义。他们曾经说苏联第一个五年计划是空想，但是在第二次世界大战之前的年代里，苏联人民却卓越地提前完成了两个五年计划。在第二次世界大战之后，他们曾经预言，苏联无法在短期内医治战争的创伤，但是苏联人民只用了不到五年的时间，就不仅恢复而且超过了战前的生产水平。于是，资产阶级的政客和学者们又预言，苏联不可能在短期内在工业生产的产量方面赶上西方国家。当苏联以飞跃的速度在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上并且超过了欧洲最发达的资本主义国家之后，他们又扬言，苏联的生产量虽然还可能有所增加，但不可能在按人口平均的产量方面和人民的生活水平方面赶上西方国家。现在，人们从苏联的七年计划中可以看到，所有这些垄断资本的代言人的预言又要破产了。
    七年计划实现后，苏联将在按人口计算的工业产量方面赶过欧洲最发达的资本主义国家——英国和西德，在某些最重要的工业产品的产量方面和最重要的农业产品按人口计算的产量方面超过美国。在1965年以后，再用大约五年的时间，苏联按人口平均的生产水平将赶上并超过美国。到那个时候，苏联无论在生产的绝对数量方面或者在按人口平均计算的产量方面将居于世界第一位，苏联人民的生活将达到世界上最高的水平。人们从这个计划中可以清楚地看到，新生的蒸蒸日上的社会主义制度的旺盛的生命力，它对于腐朽的衰落的资本主义制度具有不可争辩的优越性。
    社会主义和资本主义之间的竞赛目前正在世界范围内进行着，摆在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国面前的庄严任务是在这个竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间。苏联建设共产主义的宏伟计划，标志着社会主义同资本主义和平竞赛进入一个决定性的阶段。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在报告提纲中所说的“七年计划的国际意义在于，完成这个计划意味着社会主义世界体系的威力的进一步加强。”社会主义阵营的中心——苏联国力的巨大增长，中国和其他社会主义国家在苏联的帮助和互相支援下的经济建设的飞跃发展，将使整个社会主义阵营在物质生产方面对帝国主义阵营取得绝对的优势。到苏联七年计划实现时，社会主义阵营的工业生产总产量，在全世界总产量中所占的比重，将由目前的30％左右上升到50％以上。这将是社会主义在世界两个制度的竞赛中具有伟大历史意义的决定性的胜利。
    苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，毫无疑问将大大加强社会主义阵营的力量。苏联是社会主义阵营的团结中心。苏联的国力的壮大，也就是整个社会主义阵营力量的壮大。苏联七年计划的实现，将为社会主义各国之间的经济协作和互相支援创造更加有利的条件，促进社会主义各国经济建设和文化建设的共同高涨。建立在共同的理想、共同的利益和共同的思想基础之上的社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结，决不是帝国主义反动派的无耻挑拨和修正主义者的卑鄙破坏所能损害的。社会主义各国人民对于苏联人民建设共产主义的豪迈事业所表示的兴高采烈是十分自然的。
    苏联一贯是坚决维护世界和平、民族独立以及人类进步事业的旗手。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划有力地鼓舞着各国人民。全世界工人阶级和劳动人民从苏联建设共产主义的宏伟计划中看到了人类光明的未来，信心倍增。一切争取和维护民族独立的国家和人民都不难看到，苏联人民的建设成就对于殖民主义也是一个沉重的打击。所有爱好和平的人们都可以相信，苏联经济力量和国防力量的增强，将使帝国主义发动新的世界大战更加困难。我们的时代的特点之一，就是以苏联为首的社会主义力量同民族革命力量以及和平力量的强大联合，有足够力量制止新战争的爆发。如果帝国主义竟敢冒险发动战争，除了帝国主义的彻底灭亡以外，绝不能有别的结果。
    我们中国人民正在中国共产党的领导下进行伟大的社会主义建设。在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，我国国民经济正在以中国历史从未曾有的高速度向前发展。中国人民在自己建设社会主义的斗争中，得到了苏联全面的无私的兄弟般的援助，也得到了其他社会主义国家和世界无产阶级的援助。在我们面前有苏联这样一个光辉的榜样，我国人民建设社会主义的事业就顺利得多了。学习苏联，认真研究苏联社会主义建设和共产主义建设的经验，并根据本国特点创造性地运用这些经验，这是我们党坚定不移的方针，也是我国社会主义事业取得完全胜利的重要保证。
    从伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，在苏联共产党领导下的苏联人民一直是国际无产阶级和劳动人民的先锋队，他们走在世界人民的最前面，以建设社会主义和共产主义的光辉榜样，吸引着和鼓舞着世界人民。我们中国共产党人和全体中国人民非常高兴地看到，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会的正确领导，不但给苏联人民指出了建设共产主义的具体道路，并且对于世界和平和人类进步事业作出了伟大的贡献。现在，苏共中央提出的建设共产主义的伟大纲领，正是苏联人民和世界劳动人民在创造人类新历史的过程中的伟大文献之一，它表明新世界的前进势不可挡，争取和平和社会主义的力量越来越壮大，马克思列宁主义的红旗正在引导着人们走向越来越大的胜利。
