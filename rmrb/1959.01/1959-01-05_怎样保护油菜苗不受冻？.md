    How to Protect Rapeseed Seedlings from Freezing?
    The southern rapeseed producing areas have entered winter, and how to ensure the safe overwintering of rapeseed seedlings is an urgent task for these areas.
    According to past experience, the main threat to the safe overwintering of rapeseed seedlings is frost damage. Frost damage can be divided into three types: First, frost damage. After entering winter, the temperature difference between day and night is large. When the temperature on the rapeseed plants at night cools to 0 degrees Celsius, water vapor and water droplets evaporating from the leaf surface condense into white frost, causing the water inside the plant cells to freeze, damaging the cells or causing them to lose water, resulting in wilting and death. Second, ice damage. That is, when the winter temperature drops sharply and the soil temperature drops to 0 degrees Celsius, the water in the soil freezes into "dog-tooth ice," separating the rapeseed roots from the soil and causing the plants to be hung to death. Third, snow and ice damage. This type of damage occurs in early spring weather.
    Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, has summarized a relatively good set of experiences in rapeseed frost prevention. The simple, easy-to-implement, and effective methods they use are:
    1.  Watering: Damage from dry frost and dry ice is the most severe. When the weather is dry and the north wind is blowing, causing pain in the fingertips and toes, frost will occur. At this time, quickly carry water to shade the base of the rapeseed plants in the dry soil. Adding a few scoops of human and pig manure to each load is even better, as this can reduce evaporation and provide fertilizer. For areas with convenient irrigation, ditch irrigation can be used, ensuring that the water does not flood the ridges and is drained promptly after the soil is moistened. Frost damage is light or even non-existent in areas where the soil is moist or has been watered, which is scientifically sound. The human and pig manure that seeps in during watering should not be too concentrated to avoid damaging the seedlings. The irrigation method should be adapted to the soil conditions.
    2.  Spreading Ash Fertilizer: After entering winter and before the arrival of a major freeze, dry wood ash, old chaff ash, or dry kiln ash can be sprinkled on the hearts and leaves of rapeseed seedlings that have grown to two or three inches in height for insulation and frost prevention. Because wood ash is grayish-black, it absorbs heat quickly during the day and releases heat slowly at night, which can raise and preserve the temperature of the plant's leaf surface, preventing frost damage.
    3.  Covering with Straw and Applying Heat-Generating Fertilizer: Seedlings smaller than two inches can be covered with rice straw, sorghum, corn, and sugarcane leaves, as well as Imperata cylindrica and reeds, for insulation and frost prevention. Applying heat-generating fertilizers such as cattle manure, household ditch manure, and wall stove soil around the base is also effective in preventing frost and ice damage. Cattle manure and swamp mud contain more organic matter and are good places for microorganisms to be active. The activity of microorganisms can raise the temperature.
    4.  Shallow Hoeing and Soil Cultivation: Before "Start of Winter," generally hoeing the topsoil one or two inches deep can prevent ice damage. Shallow hoeing has three functions: it can cut off the capillary action of the soil, reduce the upward evaporation of soil moisture, and keep the soil moist; hoeing fine soil particles can increase soil gaps, maintain more air, and reduce soil heat loss; at the same time, dog-tooth ice will not lift large pieces of soil, causing root breakage and seedling death.
    5.  Smoking: Using smoke for frost prevention is also a good method. Because the smoke covers the rapeseed, it can reduce ground temperature radiation and maintain ground temperature and plant surface temperature.
    6.  Building Windbreaks: In areas where conditions permit, local materials such as sorghum, corn stalks, bamboo strips, wooden boards, and thatch can be used to build windbreaks on the north side of rapeseed fields exposed to the wind, and removed after the frost.
    7.  Pinching Shoots and Applying Topdressing: For rapeseed that bolts early, the shoots should be removed at a distance of more than one inch from the ground. If early spring shoots are damaged by snow and ice, they should also be removed as soon as possible. After pinching the shoots, apply fast-acting fertilizer immediately to promote the development of more side branches, more pods, and more seeds.

    怎样保护油菜苗不受冻？
    南方各油菜产区已进入冬季，如何保证油菜苗安全过冬是这些地区当前迫不及待的工作。
    根据历年情况来看，为害油菜苗安全过冬的，主要是冻害。冻害可分三种：一是霜害。入冬以后，日夜温度相差很大，当夜晚油菜植株上的温度冷到摄氏零度时，水蒸气和叶面蒸发水珠就凝结成白霜，使植株细胞内的水分结冰，使细胞受到破坏或失水损伤而雕萎死亡。二是凌害。即当冬季气温骤降，土壤温度下降到摄氏零度，土壤中的水分就结成“狗牙凌”，使油菜根群与土壤分离，植株被吊死。三是雪凌为害。这种为害是发生在早春天气。
    湖南平江县在油菜防冻工作上已总结了一套比较好的经验。它们采用的简单易行而有效的方法有这几种：
    一、淋水：干霜干凌的为害程度最大。在天气干燥又刮北风，手尖脚趾吹得痛时，就会打霜。这时赶快在土壤干燥的油菜地里，挑水荫蔸，如每担加几瓢人猪粪尿更好，这样可以减少蒸发，兼有肥效。灌溉方便的，可用沟灌，水不淹畦，土壤湿润后，随即排净。凡是土壤潮润或淋过水的，霜害都轻，甚至没有霜害，这是合乎科学道理的。在浇水时所渗入的人猪粪尿，不要过浓，以免损伤幼苗。在灌溉方法上应根据土壤情况，采取不同灌法。
    二、撒施灰肥：在入冬后，大冰冻来临之前，对长到两三寸以上的油菜苗子，可用干草木灰、老糠灰或干窖灰撒在油菜心子和叶片上保温防冻。因草木灰是灰黑色，白天吸热快，晚上放热慢，能提高和保存植株叶面温度，避免结霜为害。
    三、盖草和施用釀热性肥料：二寸以下的幼苗可以覆盖稻草，高粱、玉米、甘蔗叶片和山茅、芦苇等保温防冻。在蔸旁施用釀热性肥料，如牛栏粪、家沟粪与墙灶土等，对防霜、防凌均有作用。牛粪和氹肥含有机物质较多，是微生物的良好活动场所，由于微生物的活动可提高温度。
    四、浅锄培土：在“立冬”前，普遍浅锄表土一、二寸，可以防止凌害。浅锄有三方面的作用：浅锄后可切断土壤毛细管作用，减少土壤水分的上升蒸发，保持潮润；锄细土块，增加土壤间隙，保持较多空气，减少土温外散；同时狗牙凌不致将大块土壤抬起，造成断根死苗损失。
    五、熏烟：利用熏烟防冻也是一个好办法。因烟雾笼罩油菜上空，可以减少地面温度辐射，保持地面温度和植株表面温度。
    六、搭防风墙：在有条件地区，可以就地取材，将高粱、玉米秆和篾?、木板、茅草等在当风的油菜田的北面搭成防风墙，霜后拆除。
    七、摘苔追肥：对提早抽苔的油菜，应在距地面一寸多的地方摘去苔子。如早春苔子因雪凌为害，也应该及早摘去。摘苔后，随即追施速效肥料，促使它多发旁杈，荚多籽实。
