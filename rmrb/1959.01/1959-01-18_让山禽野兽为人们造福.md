Let Mountain Birds and Wild Animals Benefit the People
Shi Huitian, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department

Heilongjiang Province is one of China's major forest regions. In the depths of the forests of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains, which stretch across most of the province, there are over three hundred species of wild animals, including tigers, deer, leopards, sables, and roe deer. This is an important asset of our country. According to statistics, the highest annual output of various precious pelts in the past reached more than 1.6 million pieces, with marmot and muskrat skins accounting for about 50% of the national export volume, totaling more than 10 million yuan. The export volume of other furs and wool was also considerable. The output of by-products obtained from hunting production, such as deer antlers, musk, tiger bones, and bear bile, was also very large. The highest annual output of deer antlers in the past reached more than 45,000 taels, and musk more than 2,300 taels. These are all valuable medicinal materials commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine.

Developing hunting production is of great significance for prospering the economy of mountainous areas and supporting national construction. The establishment of people's communes has also brought favorable factors for the development of hunting production. In order to fully utilize the abundant wild animal resources, vigorously develop and prosper the economy of mountainous areas, and strive to supply the market with more mountain delicacies and game, the entire province is launching a mass hunting production upsurge. All forest areas are actively expanding hunting teams, uniformly arranging labor, fixing full-time hunters, organizing the previously unorganized hunters, and establishing professional hunting teams (groups). Many forest farms have also organized foresters, forest police, and family members of forestry workers to carry out amateur hunting activities, combining professional and amateur hunting production. Hunting production also has great technicality. We advocate the method of master teaching apprentice, or inviting forestry schools to open short-term training classes to popularize hunting technology. At the same time, experience exchanges are organized between communes and forest farms to enable the mass hunting production activities in our province to be widely carried out. In addition, in order to meet the needs of mass hunting production, the commercial departments actively cooperate, adopting the method of purchasing and selling to the mountains, taking responsibility for all material supplies, and facilitating the sale of products locally by the masses, which ensures the smooth development of mass hunting production. In the forest area city of Yichun, the mayor personally took charge, mobilizing all employees to participate in hunting production during their spare time. The output of pelts alone increased more than threefold compared to the previous year. Muleng County supplied the market with more than 4,000 catties of mountain delicacies and game in one month. Other places such as Yilan, Qing'an, and Erdaojiang Forest Farm in the middle reaches of the Mudanjiang River, have all increased their output significantly compared to previous years as a result of carrying out mass hunting.

In order to develop our province's hunting industry from a long-term perspective and change the previous situation of "the more you hunt, the less there is," we must implement the policy of "protecting, breeding, and raising beneficial birds and animals, carrying out planned hunting, and gradually eliminating harmful birds and animals to develop the hunting industry," and strictly prohibit destructive hunting in the style of "using a clay pot to hold garlic" (meaning wasteful). Hunting is prohibited during the breeding season of wild animals, and hunting of female animals and young animals is prohibited. For precious wild animals such as sika deer, Père David's deer, sable, and beaver rats, indiscriminate hunting is prohibited, but live capture for breeding is allowed. The elimination of harmful birds and animals is encouraged to protect beneficial birds and animals and the safety of forest area residents. In addition to establishing animal breeding farms for raising wild animals, wild rearing can also be adopted, with thousands of hectares of forest land designated for wild rearing to allow them to reproduce in large numbers. Forestry departments at all levels should also establish specialized agencies to formulate hunting systems, strengthen leadership over hunting production, and divide prohibited hunting areas, temporary prohibited hunting areas, and hunting areas based on the principle of protecting and breeding wild animals. Municipal and county forestry departments should also prepare annual and long-term hunting plans to stimulate the production enthusiasm of hunters and enable the hunting industry to achieve greater development.

    让山禽野兽为人们造福
    黑龙江省林业厅厅长　石蕙轩
    黑龙江省是我国主要林区之一。在绵亘全省大半地区的大小兴安岭、完达山等森林深处，有各种野生动物：虎、鹿、豹、貂、獐子等多达三百余种。这是我们国家一笔重要的财富。据统计：全省各种珍贵皮张过去最高年产量曾达到过一百六十余万张，元皮、香鼠皮约占全国出口量的50％，总值一千多万元；其他毛皮、毛绒出口数量也相当可观。从狩猎生产所获取的副产品：鹿茸、麝香、虎骨、熊胆等的产量也很大。鹿茸最高年产量过去曾达四万五千多两，麝香二千三百多两。这些都是中医常用的贵重药材。
    发展狩猎生产对繁荣山区经济，支援国家建设都有很大意义。而人民公社的建立也给狩猎生产的开展带来了有利的因素。为了充分利用丰富的野生动物资源，大力发展繁荣山区经济，并争取有更多的山珍野味供应市场，全省正在掀起一个群众性的打猎生产高潮。各林区积极扩大狩猎队伍，统一安排劳力，固定常年狩猎人员，把过去无组织的猎民组织起来，建立专业性的狩猎队（组）。很多林场也组织了营林员、森警及林业职工家属开展业余狩猎活动，把专业和业余的狩猎生产结合起来。猎业生产同样有很大的技术性，我们提倡以师傅带徒弟的办法，或请林业学校开短期训练班，普及狩猎技术。同时在公社间、林场间组织经验交流，使我省群众性的狩猎生产活动广泛地开展起来。此外，为适应群众性狩猎生产需要，商业部门积极配合，采取购销到山的办法，负责一切物资供应，便利群众就地出售产品，这就保证了群众性狩猎生产的顺利开展。林区城市伊春，市长亲自挂帅，发动全市职工利用业余时间参加狩猎生产，单是皮张产量就比前一年增加三倍多。穆棱县一个月就供应市场山珍野味四千余斤。其他像依兰、庆安、牡丹江中游的二道河子林场等，开展群众性狩猎的结果，产量都比往年提高了许多。
    为了从长远着眼发展我省狩猎事业，改变以往越打越少的情况，必须贯彻“保护、繁殖、饲养有益鸟兽，进行有计划的猎取，并逐步消灭有害鸟兽，以发展狩猎事业”的方针，严禁那种“砂锅倒蒜”式的破坏性的猎取。在野兽繁殖期内禁止狩猎，禁止打母兽、小兽。对珍贵的野兽，如梅花鹿、麋鹿、紫貂、海狸鼠等，要禁止乱捕乱打，但可允许活捉饲养。对于有害鸟兽则鼓励消灭，以保障益鸟益兽和林区居民安全。对野生动物的饲养，除建立动物饲养场外，也可采取野养办法，在森林中划定数千公顷林地进行野养，使其大量繁殖。各级林业部门还要建立专门机构，制订狩猎制度，加强对狩猎生产的领导，并要根据保护和繁殖野生动物的原则，划分禁猎区、临时禁猎区和狩猎区。市、县林业部门还要做好狩猎的年度和远景规划，以激发猎民的生产积极性，使狩猎事业得到更大的发展。（附图片）
