    Strengthening the Teaching Staff, Improving Teaching Quality
    Yancheng Appoints a Group of Grassroots Cadres as Teachers

    (Our report) Zhengzhou: The Yancheng County in Henan Province has selected several hundred teachers from high school, junior high school, and senior primary school graduates who have undergone several years of labor training and served in grassroots positions to supplement and strengthen the county's teaching staff and improve teaching quality.

    Since last year, education in primary and secondary schools in Yancheng County has greatly developed, but the problem of teachers could not be completely solved for a time. At that time, the county lacked more than 300 middle and primary school teachers (mainly primary school teachers), which affected the progress and quality of teaching. The Yancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the key to improving the quality of teaching lies in having a teaching staff that is both red and expert and sufficient in number. After the realization of people's communes in Yancheng County, the grassroots organizations were merged, which made it possible to transfer a group of township and commune cadres who had been trained and had a certain level of education to strengthen education work.

    For more than a month, Yancheng County has transferred 318 township and commune cadres with considerable cultural levels to serve as teachers in primary and secondary schools. Among them are work team and production team leaders, Communist Youth League branch secretaries, township women's federation directors, work recorders, accountants, production team leaders, and general commune members. Some township CCP committees have also selected some township heads and former agricultural cooperative branch secretaries with a certain level of education to serve as primary school principals. Among these more than 300 teachers, there are 148 party and league members, of whom more than 90% are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds. They are almost all active members of various rural production movements and political movements. Now, the county's teachers have been fully equipped, and the political outlook of the teaching staff has also been greatly changed. This group of new teachers has returned to schools in their original townships after receiving short-term professional training at the county normal school. The relevant departments of the county have also set up correspondence stations in the county's 15 townships to regularly guide them in their professional studies.

    This group of young teachers has high political enthusiasm and is active in learning. They have close ties with the working people and have a correct view of physical labor. Therefore, after they became teachers, the schools quickly showed a vigorous new look. The teaching banners of the five schools in Mengmiao Township of this county are the five new female teachers. These five female teachers study and teach diligently and take care of their students meticulously. The students call them "mother teachers." Parents are also very relieved to entrust their children to them. Huang Zhaolin, a new teacher at Jiangtang Middle School, was originally a work recorder in an agricultural cooperative. After arriving at the school, he combined with the chemistry class to create 13 kinds of chemical fertilizers together with the students, which promoted local agricultural production and improved teaching quality. Zhang Guangqian, who used to be an accountant, created the "Abacus Rapid Learning Method" shortly after taking the arithmetic class, which greatly shortened the time for learning the abacus. This group of new teachers generally has a correct understanding of the educational policy of combining education with productive labor. They have a deeper understanding of unreasonable teaching content, educational systems, and teaching methods. Therefore, they are also active members of teaching reform in various schools.

### 增强教师队伍　提高教学质量  郾城一批基层干部担任教师

    增强教师队伍　提高教学质量
    郾城一批基层干部担任教师
    本报讯　河南省郾城县从受过几年劳动锻炼和担任过基层工作的高、初中和高小毕业生中，挑选几百名教师，补充和加强全县教师队伍，提高了教学质量。
    去年以来，郾城县中小学教育有很大的发展，但师资问题一时不能完全解决。当时，全县缺少三百多名中、小学教师（主要是小学教师），影响了教学进度和教学质量。中共郾城县委认为，提高教学质量的关键，在于有一支又红又专、数量足够的教师队伍。郾城县实现人民公社化以后，基层组织进行合并，这就有可能抽调一批受过锻炼而又有一定文化水平的乡社干部来加强教育工作。
    一个多月以来，郾城县已经抽调了三百一十八名具有相当文化水平的乡社干部担任中小学教师，这里有作业队和生产队队长，共青团支部书记，乡妇联主任，记工员，会计，生产组长和一般社员。有些乡的中共党委还挑选了一些具有一定文化水平的乡长，原来农业社的支部书记担任小学校长。这三百多名教师中，有党团员一百四十八人，其中贫农中农成份占90％以上。他们几乎都是农村各项生产运动和政治运动的积极分子，现在，全县教师已经配备齐全；教师队伍的政治面貌也大大改观。这批新教师到县师范学校受短期业务训练后，已回原乡各学校。这个县的有关部门，又在全县十五个乡设立了函授站，经常指导他们进行业务学习。
    这批青年教师政治热情很高，学习积极，同劳动人民有着密切联系，对体力劳动有着正确的看法，因此，在他们担任教师以后，各学校很快出现了朝气蓬勃的新景象。这个县孟庙乡五个学校的教学旗帜，就是五位新教师。这五位女教师刻苦学习和教学，无微不至地关心学生；学生们称她们为“母亲教师”。家长把自己的孩子交给她们也很放心。蒋堂中学的新教师黄兆临，原是农业社的记工员，到学校后结合化学课，同学生一起创造了十三种化学肥料，推动了当地农业生产，也提高了教学质量。做过会计的张光乾，担任算术课不久，就创造了“珠算速成法”，大大缩短了学习珠算的时间。这批新教师对于教育和生产劳动结合的教育方针一般有正确的认识，他们对于不合理的教学内容、教育制度、教学方法等体会较深，因此，他们也是各学校教学改革中的积极分子。
