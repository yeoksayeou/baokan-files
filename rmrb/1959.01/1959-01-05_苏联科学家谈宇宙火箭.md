Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS reports, it will be possible for humans to travel in space within the first five years of the sixties, that is, before the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, Academician Naan of the Estonian Academy of Sciences told TASS reporters on the 3rd.

Naan is a well-known cosmology expert who mentioned the possibility of launching a rocket to the moon within a year last May. Regarding the Soviet Union's launch of a rocket to the moon this time, the scientist pointed out that although this event was not unexpected in principle, it still caused people to be pleasantly surprised, especially the weight of the final stage of the cosmic rocket. In the past, experts believed that the effective load of a lunar rocket would be a few kilograms, or at most a few tens of kilograms, but the fact exceeded all the most optimistic expectations. This once again proves that if the problem of the return of organisms to Earth is completely solved, then human space travel will become entirely possible.

He said that the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket was a very important step forward in the study of the universe. As everyone knows, in the past, satellites have been operating within the Earth's gravitational field. Now, for the first time, people have broken through the second cosmic velocity and crossed the range where the Earth's gravity occupies a dominant position. It has become possible to launch an artificial satellite orbiting the moon and make it run along the common orbit of the moon and the earth. If the effective weight of the Soviet Union's first cosmic rocket launched to the lunar region is reduced, then this rocket can be launched to Mars.

He also pointed out that the Soviet rocket's entry into the moon's orbit proves that the Soviet Union already has a highly accurate aiming system, which is qualitatively far superior to similar American equipment.

The Beginning of Human Direct Study of Celestial Bodies
Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS, Mikhailov, chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told TASS reporters that the Soviet cosmic rocket was launched under more difficult conditions - during the waning moon period. At this time, the moon was located near the celestial equator.

Mikhailov said that the most convenient period for such a launch is the new moon period, but at this time it is impossible to observe the situation near the moon by optical methods. When the Soviet Union launched this rocket, the moon had already moved far into the southern hemisphere, so it is best to observe the rocket's operation at observatories located in southern Soviet Union - Crimea, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia.

In order to realize the launch of a cosmic rocket, it is not only necessary to make the speed of this rocket almost one and a half times the speed required for an artificial Earth satellite, but also to calculate and provide the value and direction of this speed very accurately. A slight negligence in calculating the speed will cause the experiment to fail.

Mikhailov said that what we have actually created is not an artificial satellite, but an artificial planet. The information it provides is the most valuable data for studying the physical conditions of cosmic space.

He emphasized that this achievement marks the true beginning of studying these celestial bodies through the path of direct human access to the celestial bodies of the solar system.

Interstellar Flight in the Solar System Can Fly as Far as You Want
Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS reports: The Soviet flag carried into space by the Soviet cosmic rocket is a symbol of the Soviet Union's leading position in modern science and technology. The launch of this rocket as the first test of true spaceflight is of great significance. From now on, this flight has become a reality.

This is what Blokhintsev, director of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research near Moscow and head of the construction of the world's first atomic energy power station, said when talking about the significance of the successful launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket. He said that the successful launch of the Soviet lunar rocket is an exciting event. It makes a strong impression.

Aigenson, director of the Lviv University Observatory in the Soviet Union, said that Soviet scientists are now able to confidently plan interplanetary flights to any part of the solar system, as far as they want to fly. There is every reason to believe that the time is not far away when the first Soviet interplanetary travelers will land on some of the celestial bodies closest to us in the solar system. Aigenson said that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket to the moon means that we can now launch rockets with any predetermined orbital curve.

Tikhov, a famous Soviet astronomer and the founder of the new branch of astronomy - astrobotany, said that the rocket flying to the moon has reached the second cosmic velocity, and it has broken away from the Earth's gravity and entered interplanetary space. This is a fact of fundamental importance. He said that it can be expected that the time for flying to other planets is not far away. The mystery of whether there is life on Mars will finally be revealed.

Feodorov, corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, emphasized that the weight and scientific equipment of the Soviet cosmic rocket are dozens of times larger than those of the American rocket that attempted to be launched into space but failed.

Unprecedented Speed, Amazing Weight, Completely Accurate Flight Control
Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS Moscow: Unprecedented speed, amazing weight, and completely accurate flight control are prominent signs of the development of Soviet rocket technology.

This is what Blagonravov, the leader of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told TASS reporters. He compared the characteristics of Soviet rocket technology with those of the United States. He said that the Soviet cosmic rocket has an extremely high speed that even the moon cannot catch, so it will not become a permanent satellite orbiting the moon. It will cross the moon and continue to fly in the universe of the solar system. This is the so-called second cosmic velocity reached by a rocket for the first time in the world. The Soviet rocket is the first object from Earth to break through Earth's gravity. This is the first distinct sign of the development of Soviet rocket technology. Soviet science and technology have already moved ahead of the United States. As everyone knows, the United States has made several attempts in this regard, but all have failed: in October last year, the rocket launched by the United States to the moon fell before reaching the lunar region due to the influence of Earth's gravity.

Blagonravov said that another convincing sign of the Soviet Union's lead is the weight of the previously launched Soviet artificial satellites and the weight of the lunar rocket, which is nearly one and a half tons. The weight of the last American artificial satellite is not even as much as the first Soviet artificial satellite.

Blagonravov continued that the third sign that shows the achievements of Soviet rocket technology is that the rocket flies according to a predetermined orbit. Soviet scientists and engineers have solved the most difficult task of controlling the flight of rockets. After explaining that the cosmic rocket is not a lunar satellite, Blagonravov said that the main task of launching a lunar rocket is to obtain new scientific materials about cosmic rays that are free from the influence of the Earth's magnetic poles, and new materials about the composition of interstellar matter. The rocket is equipped with extremely accurate Soviet instruments, which can be the first to answer the question of whether there is a lunar magnetic pole and the radiant energy on the surface of the moon.

Peeking into the Mysteries of the Moon and the Earth
Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to TASS reports, some famous Soviet scientists have made speeches introducing the important significance of the Soviet cosmic rocket for understanding the moon and the earth.

Professor Fydensky, a member of the International Geophysical Year Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out that now there is a possibility of studying the internal structure of the moon by observing the lunar magnetic field, which is a fact of great importance. It can be judged from the study of the lunar magnetic field alone how the internal structure of the moon is, and whether it has the same core as the Earth's core. It is generally believed that the source of the Earth's magnetism is in the Earth's core. The concept of the moon's internal natural structure is very important for understanding the history of the Earth at various periods. Soviet geologists believe that the history of the moon's development is very similar to the Earth's geological history. For example, traces of mountain building movements and traces of volcanic eruptions can also be found on the surface of the moon. Leningrad scientist Kozyrev even recently discovered active volcanoes on the moon. The moon and the Earth undoubtedly have a common origin and a common cosmic history. The information obtained from cosmic rockets can help clarify the truth about these unresolved issues. Dr. Habibshirin, director of the Astronomy Teaching and Research Department of Kazan University, said that the cosmic rocket launched by the Soviet Union is a great victory for Soviet science. Kazan astronomers have been engaged in the research of the shape of the moon and its law of operation for more than 60 years. Basic observations of the moon have been completed in Kazan, and this observation is a valuable data for careful study of the characteristics of the moon's operation. Astronomers in Kazan are looking forward to obtaining a lot of new information from cosmic rockets. Professor Alpert, a Soviet geomagnetism expert, said that the instruments on the Soviet lunar rocket have sufficient sensitivity to measure the weakening of the Earth's magnetic field at a considerable distance and to detect the magnetism in the lunar region.

Until now, magnetic phenomena have been discovered only on the sun in addition to the earth. However, neither the Earth's magnetism nor the Sun's magnetism is well understood so far. It is possible that the sources of magnetic fields on the Earth and the Sun are different, because the Sun is a hot body, and strong electromagnetic processes occur on its surface. This process itself will produce strong local magnetic fields. It has not been clarified whether the sun has a magnetic field as a cosmic body. Examining the magnetism on the cold, "dead" moon can solve this mystery.

Alpert also pointed out that after studying the observation results of the sodium cloud released by the Soviet lunar rocket, important data on the density of interplanetary matter can be obtained. The height and size changes of this artificial comet are directly related to the state of the surrounding medium - the density and mass of interstellar gas.

The instruments on the rocket may determine the chemical composition of interplanetary gas. This is of great significance for accurately calculating the flight paths and speeds of future unmanned spacecraft. In particular, this will help to launch the next rocket in a more accurate direction towards the moon. (Attached picture)

    苏联科学家谈宇宙火箭
    人到宇宙去旅行七年内就可实现
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道，在六十年代的前五年，也就是在苏联七年计划完成之前，人就有可能从事宇宙旅行了，这是苏联爱沙尼亚科学院院士纳安3日对塔斯社记者说的。
    纳安是著名的宇宙学专家，去年5月他曾谈到可能在一年内向月球发射火箭的问题。这位科学家在谈到苏联这次向月球发射火箭时指出，尽管这一事件在原理上并非出乎意料之外，但它仍然引起人们的惊喜，特别是宇宙火箭最后一级的重量。过去专家们认为，月球火箭的有效载重将是几公斤，最多也不过几十公斤，而事实却超过了一切最乐观的预料。这再一次证明，如果生物返回地球的问题得到彻底解决，那么人类的宇宙旅行将成为完全可能的了。
    他说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射在研究宇宙方面迈进了极重要的一大步。大家知道，过去卫星一直是在地球重力场范围内运行。而现在人们第一次突破了第二宇宙速度，越出了地球引力占主要地位的范围了。发射围绕月球运行的人造卫星以及使它沿着月亮和地球的共同轨道运行，已经成为可能的事情了。如果把苏联第一支发向月球区域的宇宙火箭的有效重量减小，那末这支火箭就可以向火星发射了。
    他还指出，苏联火箭进入到月球去的轨道一事证明，苏联已经有了高度精确的瞄准系统，在质量上大大超过美国类似的器械。
    人类直接研究天体的开端
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联科学院天文学委员会主席米哈伊洛夫对塔斯社记者说，苏联宇宙火箭是在较困难的条件下——下弦时期发射的。这时月球位于天球赤道附近。
    米哈伊洛夫说，最便于进行这种发射的时期是新月时期，但在这时无法用光学的方法观测月球附近的情况。苏联在发射这个火箭时月球已经远远地走到南半球，因此最好在位于苏联南部——克里米亚、外高加索、中亚细亚的天文台来观测火箭的运行。
    为了实现宇宙火箭的发射，不仅需要使这个火箭的速度差不多相当于人造地球卫星所需速度的一倍半，而且还需要非常精确地计算并提供这种速度的值和方向。在计算速度方面有一点点疏忽，就会使试验归于失败。
    米哈伊洛夫说，我们实际上所创造出来的不是人造卫星，而是人造行星。它所提供的情况都是研究宇宙空间物理条件最珍贵的资料。
    他强调指出，这次的成就标志着通过人直接访问太阳系天体的途径来研究这些天体的真正开端。
    在太阳系中作星际飞行要飞多远就能飞多远
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联宇宙火箭带到宇宙中的苏联旗帜，是苏联在现代科学技术方面名列冠军的标志。这个火箭的发射作为真正宇宙飞行的第一个试验具有重大意义。从现在起，这种飞行已经成为现实了。
    这是莫斯科近郊联合原子核研究所所长、世界第一个原子能发电站修建负责人勃洛欣采夫在谈到苏联宇宙火箭发射成功的意义时说的。他说，苏联月球火箭发射成功是一件震奋人心的事件。它使人产生强烈的印象。
    苏联利沃夫大学天文台台长艾根松说，苏联科学家现在已经能够有把握地计划向太阳系中任何区段从事行星际飞行，要飞多远就飞多远，有一切根据认为，苏联第一批行星际旅行家在太阳系中离我们最近的一些天体上着陆的时间已经不远了。艾根松说，苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭意味着，现在我们可以用任何一种事先预定的轨道曲线来发射火箭。
    苏联著名天文学家，天文学新部门——天体植物学的奠基人季霍夫说，飞向月球的火箭已经达到了第二宇宙速度，它脱离了地球的引力而进入行星际空间，这是具有原则性重要意义的事实。他说，可以指望，飞向其他行星的时间已经不远了。火星上是否有生命之谜最后也终于将能揭开。
    苏联科学院通讯院士费奥多罗夫着重指出，苏联宇宙火箭的重量和科学装备比美国企图发向宇宙空间而没有成功的火箭要大几十倍。
    空前的速度惊人的重量完全准确的飞行控制
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：空前的速度、惊人的重量和完全准确的飞行控制是苏联火箭技术发展的突出标志。
    这是苏联科学院技术科学部领导人布拉冈拉沃夫对塔斯社记者说的，他把苏联的火箭技术的特点和美国作了对比。他说，苏联宇宙火箭具有连月亮都抓不住它的极大的速度，因此它不会变成永久围绕月球运转的卫星，它将越过月亮继续在太阳系的宇宙中飞行。这是世界上第一次用火箭达到的所谓第二宇宙速度。苏联火箭是第一个突破地球引力的地球上的物体。这是苏联火箭技术发展的第一个鲜明标志。苏联科学和技术已经走在美国前面。大家知道，美国在这方面作了几次尝试，都失败了：去年10月美国向月球发射的火箭由于地球引力的影响没有达到月球地区就坠落了。
    布拉冈拉沃夫说，另一个表明苏联占先的令人信服的标志是，以前所发射的苏联人造卫星的重量和将近一吨半的月球火箭的重量。而美国最后一个人造卫星的重量还赶不上苏联第一个人造卫星。
    布拉冈拉沃夫接着说，表明苏联火箭技术成就的第三个标志是，火箭按照事先规定的轨道飞行。苏联科学家和工程师们已经解决了控制火箭飞行的最艰难的任务。布拉冈拉沃夫在解释了宇宙火箭并不是月球卫星之后又说，发射月球火箭的主要任务是，获得有关摆脱地球磁极影响的宇宙线的新的科学材料，以及有关星际物质构成的新材料。火箭上装置有极准确的苏联仪器，它可以第一个回答月球磁极是否存在和月球表面辐射能的问题。
    窥探月球、地球奥秘
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联一些著名科学家发表谈话，介绍了苏联宇宙火箭对于了解月球和地球的重要意义。
    苏联科学院国际地球物理年委员会委员费登斯基教授指出，现在出现了用观察月球磁场的方法研究月球内部构造的可能性，这是一个有巨大重要意义的事实。仅仅从对月球磁场的研究中就可以判断月球内部构造如何，它是否有与地球核心相同的核心。一般认为地球磁源在地球核心中。关于月球内部自然构造的概念对认识地球历史各个时期是非常重要的。苏联地质学家认为，月球发展的历史与地球的地质历史非常相象，例如在月球表面也可以发现造山运动的遗迹，火山爆发的痕迹。列宁格勒科学家科齐列夫最近甚至发现了月球上的活火山。月球和地球无疑具有共同的起源和共同的宇宙历史。从宇宙火箭上获得的资料可以帮助阐明对这些尚未明确的问题的真相。喀山大学天文学教研室主任哈比希林博士说，苏联发射的宇宙火箭是苏联科学的巨大胜利。喀山天文学家们从事月球外形和它的运转规律的研究工作已有六十多年了。在喀山已经完成了对月球的基本观测，这种观测是仔细研究月球运行特点的宝贵资料。喀山的天文学家们更加期望着从宇宙火箭中得到许多新的资料。苏联地磁学专家阿尔佩尔特教授说，苏联宇宙火箭上的仪器有足够的灵敏度，来测定在相当远的距离上地球磁场的减弱和测知月球区域的磁性。
    直到目前为止，除了地球以外，只在太阳上发现了磁性现象。然而无论是地球的磁性，还是太阳的磁性，到目前为止都还不十分清楚。可能，地球上和太阳上的磁场来源不同，因为太阳是一个炽热体，在它的表面上发生强有力的电磁过程。这种过程本身会产生出强有力的局部性的磁场。到现在还没有弄清楚，太阳作为一个宇宙体是否具有磁场。考察在寒冷的“死寂的”月球上的磁性就能够解决这个谜。
    阿尔佩尔特还指出，对苏联月球火箭放出的钠云观测结果进行研究后，就能够得到行星际物质密度的重要资料。这种人造彗星的高度和大小的变化同周围介质的状态——同星际气体的密度和质量有直接关系。
    火箭上的仪器将可能确定行星际气体的化学成分。这对于精确地计算未来无人驾驶的宇宙飞船的飞行轨道和它们的速度具有巨大的意义。特别是，这将有助于更准确地向月球方向发射下一个火箭。（附图片）
