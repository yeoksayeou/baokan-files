Beijing astronomical workers yesterday continued to observe the largest sunspot group to appear on the sun's surface in nearly a decade. It is located between 12 and 13 degrees north latitude on the solar disk and is changing rapidly.

Astronomical workers at the Preparatory Office of the Beijing Observatory first observed this large sunspot group on the 5th of this month. At that time, it appeared as two large patches on the eastern edge of the sun, with the line connecting their centers parallel to the east-west line. The leading sunspot had a larger area. Later, the two sunspots gradually separated. The leading sunspot did not change much, while the following sunspot split into many small sunspots and tended to disappear.

On the 8th, the area of this sunspot group reached its maximum value, equivalent to the size of fifty-nine Earths. Its east-west length was fifteen times the Earth's diameter (equivalent to 190,000 kilometers), and its north-south direction was eight times the Earth's diameter (equivalent to 100,000 kilometers).

Astronomical workers directly observing the sunspot group said that since the appearance of this group of sunspots, magnetic storms of "moderate" intensity have occurred for several days, sometimes with larger disturbances. On the 9th and 10th of this month, the Earth's ionosphere also began to be disturbed. This sunspot group has already moved from the central part of the sun's surface to the west, and the area of the sunspot group is gradually decreasing.

### 北京天文工作者  观测到太阳上的大黑子群

    北京天文工作者
    观测到太阳上的大黑子群
    本报讯　北京天文台筹备处的天文工作者昨天继续观测近十年来太阳表面所出现的最大的黑子群，它位于日面纬度北纬十二度到十三度之间，变化迅速。
    北京天文台筹备处的天文工作者们在本月5日第一次观测到这群大黑子，当时在太阳的东边缘呈现两大块，其中心连线平行于东西线，前导黑子面积较大。后来，这两个黑子逐渐分离，前导黑子没有多大变化，而随后的黑子分裂成很多小黑子，并趋于消失。
    8日，这个黑子群的面积发展到最大值，相当于五十九个地球的大小，东西方的长度为地球直径的十五倍（相当于十九万公里），南北方向为地球直径的八倍（相当于十万公里）。
    直接观测太阳黑子群的天文工作者们说，自从这群黑子出现以后，连日发生强度为“中常”的磁暴，有时是较大的扰动。本月9、10两日，地球表面的电离层也开始受到骚扰。这个黑子群已经太阳表面的中部向西部转移，黑子群的面积也在逐渐变小。
