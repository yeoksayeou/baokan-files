Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd: A million Cuban people held a massive demonstration and rally in the capital, Havana, on the 21st, opposing U.S. imperialism's unreasonable interference in Cuba's internal affairs. This unprecedented mass demonstration and rally in Cuban history is a tough response to the malicious American interference campaign against Cuba's punishment of criminals. The demonstrators angrily condemned the shameless actions of the United States and unanimously and enthusiastically supported the government's resolute measures to punish Batista's murderers.

From six o'clock in the morning on the 21st, government agencies, schools, factories, and shops in the capital, Havana, ceased operations. Participants in the demonstration and mass rally included residents of Havana, as well as workers, farmers, students, rebel soldiers, and people from other walks of life from all over the country. Almost one in six people in Cuba participated in the demonstration. To get to the meeting on time, farmers and students from provinces far from the capital had been walking towards Havana for days.

The demonstration began in the afternoon of the 21st. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, holding aloft huge banners with slogans such as "Oppose Foreign Interference!" and "Punish the Murderers!", marched towards the streets of Havana, heading towards "People's Square" in front of the Presidential Palace, shouting like thunder. All the streets and alleys of Havana and the four-mile area around the venue were blocked by people. As they marched, the demonstrators chanted slogans against foreign interference and in support of the government's resolute suppression of murderers.

As the crowd marched, military aircraft of the provisional government flew overhead to salute the demonstrators.

Fidel Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, spoke to a million cheering people from the balcony of the Presidential Palace, which was adorned with a giant Cuban flag. Castro denounced the malicious slander campaign recently launched by the U.S. Congress and the American propaganda machine, aimed at preventing the Cuban government from suppressing murderers. He said, "When a group of ruling thieves stole billions of dollars, when half a dozen compatriots were brutally murdered every night, when there were bodies of young people with bullet holes in their heads everywhere, when barracks were full of corpses, when women were raped and tortured, no propaganda campaign was launched in the United States. These movements were not against (the then) Cuba, and no American congressmen came out—except for a very few—to condemn the dictatorship."

Castro asked the people to express their will. He appealed to the crowd gathered in the square: "All those who demand the punishment of the executioners, please raise your hands." Then, a chorus of voices rose from the square, and millions of hands were raised like one. Castro said: "You see, a million Cubans with various viewpoints and from all walks of life have made a decision as jurors."

Castro received enthusiastic applause from the crowd when he emphasized the following passage. He said, "We demand that the U.S. government return the Cuban war criminals, and we also ask the American people to demand that their government return those war criminals." He said, "The Cuban people have no hostility towards the American people... The forces with malicious intentions that the Cuban people oppose are also enemies of the American people." He also said, "If the United States has any respect for the feelings of the Cuban people, the United States should extradite those war criminals."

Castro stated that Cuba would resolutely demand that the government of the Dominican Republic extradite Batista back to be tried by the people.

In his speech, Castro pointed out that "Cuba demands not only political freedom, but also economic freedom." He said that the Cuban government will "revise and abolish" the "various privileges granted to foreign enterprises" by the former Batista dictatorship.

Castro also asked the Cuban people to approve a motion of his: If he were killed one day, he would recommend Raúl Castro as his successor. He said, "Now my enemies know who will succeed me, and if they kill Raúl again, there will be another, another, another person to succeed him. The revolution will never be without leaders."

After Castro's speech, Provisional President Urrutia also spoke.

Farmers who came to participate in the mass demonstration and rally in Havana angrily accused the Batista murderers, who were supported by the United States, of their crimes. A peasant woman named Idalgia Lavasa told people about the tragic death of her husband, who had joined the rebel army. Lavasa accused that a Batista army patrol pulled her husband out of the house, "cut off his hands and feet, poured gasoline on him, and burned him alive in front of her." Lavasa was just one of the six hundred farmers who came to Havana to accuse, and the testimony of these good people will expose the true intentions of the United States' interference in Cuba's punishment of criminals.

    坚决保卫革命果实　反击美国横蛮干涉
    古巴百万群众反美大示威
    卡斯特罗宣布古巴不但要求政治上自由而且要求经济上自由
    美国必须交回巴蒂斯塔罪犯，古巴将修改和废除外国企业特权
    新华社22日讯　哈瓦那消息：一百万古巴人民21日在首都哈瓦那举行声势浩大的示威游行和群众集会，反对美帝国主义无理干涉古巴内政。这次在古巴历史上盛况空前的群众性的示威和集会，是对美国恶意进行的反对古巴惩治罪犯的干涉运动的强硬答复。参加示威和集会的人们愤怒谴责美国的无耻行动，并且一致热烈支持政府惩办巴蒂斯塔杀人罪犯的坚决措施。
    从21日清晨六时起，首都哈瓦那的政府各机关、学校、工厂和商店都停止了工作。参加这次示威和群众集会的有哈瓦那的居民，也有来自全国各个角落的工人、农民、学生、起义军战士以及其他阶层的群众。在古巴全国的人口中，几乎每六个人就有一个人参加了这次示威。为了及时赶来开会，一些离首都较远的省份的农民和学生早在几天以前就步行前往哈瓦那。
    示威游行是在21日下午开始的。成千上万高举着“反对外国干涉！”和“惩治杀人罪犯！”等巨大标语旗帜的示威者发出雷鸣般的吼声拥向哈瓦那各个街道，朝着总统府前面的“人民广场”前进。哈瓦那市内所有的大街小巷以及会场附近四英里地区都为人流所堵塞。示威群众一面行进，一面高呼反对外国干涉和表示支持政府坚决镇压杀人罪犯的口号。
    在人群行进的时候，临时政府的军用飞机飞翔在空中向示威群众致敬。
    古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在悬挂着一面巨大的古巴国旗的总统府的阳台上向一百万欢呼的群众讲了话。卡斯特罗痛斥美国国会和美国的宣传机器最近一个时期所掀起的、目的在于阻止古巴政府镇压杀人罪犯的恶意毁谤运动。他说，“当一群执政的窃贼偷盗了上十亿的美元，当每天夜里有半打同胞被残杀，到处是头部被子弹打穿的青年人的躯体，兵营里充满了尸首，妇女们被强奸和遭受折磨的时候，在美国并没有掀起什么宣传运动。这些运动并没有反对（当时的）古巴，也没有任何美国议员出来——除了极少数以外——谴责独裁制度。”
    卡斯特罗要求人民表示他们的意志。他向拥集在广场上的人群发出呼吁说：“凡是要求惩处刽子手的请举手。”于是，广场上响起一片呼声，千万只手像一个人似地高举了起来。卡斯特罗说：“你们瞧，抱有各种观点和属于各阶层的一百万古巴人作为陪审员作出了决定。”
    当卡斯特罗着重谈到下面一段话的时候，他也受到群众的热烈欢呼。他说，“我们要求美国政府交回古巴战犯，我们也请美国人民要求他们的政府交回那些战犯。”他说，“古巴人民对美国人民没有任何敌意……古巴人民反对的那些怀有恶意的势力也是美国人民的敌人。”他还说，“如果美国对古巴人民的心情还有任何尊重的话，美国就应该引渡那些战犯。”
    卡斯特罗表示，古巴将坚决要求多米尼加政府把巴蒂斯塔引渡回来受人民的审判。
    卡斯特罗在演说中指出，“古巴不但要求政治上的自由，而且也要求经济上的自由”。他说，古巴政府将要“修改和废除”前巴蒂斯塔独裁政府“给予外国企业的各种特权”。
    卡斯特罗还要求古巴人民批准他的一个动议：如果有一天他被打死，他推荐劳尔·卡斯特罗作为他的继承人。他说：“现在我的敌人知道谁将接替我，而如果他们再打死劳尔的话，还会有另外的、另外的、另外的人来接替他。革命绝不会没有领导人的。”
    卡斯特罗讲话后，临时政府总统乌鲁蒂亚也讲了话。
    赶来参加哈瓦那群众示威和集会的农民，愤怒地控诉了那些得到美国支持的巴蒂斯塔杀人犯的罪行。有一位叫做伊达耳吉亚·拉瓦萨的农妇告诉了人们她的参加起义军的丈夫惨遭杀害的情景。拉瓦萨控诉说，一个巴蒂斯塔陆军巡逻兵把她的丈夫拉到屋外，“砍掉了他的手和脚，在他身上浇上了汽油，就在她的面前把他活活烧死”。拉瓦萨只是前来哈瓦那控诉的六百个农民中的一个，这些善良人们的证言将揭穿美国干涉古巴惩罚罪犯的真实意图。（附图片）
