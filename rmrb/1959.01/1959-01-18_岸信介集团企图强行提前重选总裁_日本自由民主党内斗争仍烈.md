Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The factional struggle within Japan's ruling party is experiencing a resurgence. On January 14th, the "anti-mainstream faction" of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expressed its firm opposition to the "mainstream faction" led by Kishi Nobusuke, which is attempting to forcibly advance the re-election of the party president. The struggle between the two factions is intensifying.

Since the "mainstream" and "anti-mainstream" factions of the LDP reached a temporary compromise at the end of last year, Kishi Nobusuke has been trying to ease the contradictions between the two factions by replacing LDP leaders and partially reorganizing the cabinet. He also planned to hold the party convention, which should elect a new president in March, as early as January, before the "anti-mainstream faction" could unify its stance, in order to be re-elected as president, and try to temporarily stabilize the political situation and weather the difficulties of the Diet session.

After a series of tense negotiations between the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction," on January 10th, on behalf of LDP President Kishi Nobusuke, Ohno Banboku designated Fukuda Takeo (Kishi Nobusuke faction) as Secretary-General, Nakamura Umeji (Kono Ichiro faction) as Chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council, and Masuda Koshichi (Sato Eisaku faction) as Chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee at the General Council meeting.益谷秀次Masuya Hideji (Ikeda Hayato faction) and 竹山祐太郎Takeyama Yutaro (Miki Takeo - Matsumura Kenzo faction) from the "anti-mainstream faction" respectively obtained the positions of Chairman of the General Council and Chairman of the National Organization Committee. The candidate for Chairman of the Party Discipline Committee will be decided by the party convention. On January 12th, Kishi Nobusuke partially reorganized the cabinet. Among the newly appointed officials, 橋本龍五Hashimoto Ryugo (Sato Eisaku faction, former Minister of Health and Welfare) served as Minister of Education, 伊能繁次郎Ino Shigejiro (Kishi Nobusuke faction) served as Director-General of the "Defense Agency," 世耕弘一Seko Koichi (Ishibashi Tanzan faction) from the "anti-mainstream faction" served as Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, and 坂田道太Sakata Michita (Ishii Mitsujiro faction) served as Minister of Health and Welfare. Because Ishii Mitsujiro, one of the leaders of the "anti-mainstream faction," firmly refused to participate in the cabinet, the position of Minister of State vacated by Ikeda Hayato remained vacant.

After this replacement of LDP leaders and partial reorganization of the cabinet, an "unstable equilibrium" emerged between the "mainstream" and "anti-mainstream" factions. However, this failed to quell the internal struggle within the LDP.

From the performance of the various factions of the LDP in the cabinet reshuffle and the allocation of personnel within the party, it can be seen that not only did Ishii Mitsujiro himself refuse to participate in the cabinet because Kishi Nobusuke did not accept the "anti-mainstream faction's" demand for a large-scale cabinet reshuffle, but the Ikeda faction and the Miki-Matsumura faction, which have influence in the "anti-mainstream faction," were also not included in the reorganized cabinet. The Ishibashi faction did not get a share in the new candidates for the party's leadership.

Kishi Nobusuke admitted at the cabinet meeting on the 16th that his position in the government and the LDP was unstable, so he anxiously wanted to cope with the deepening crisis by re-electing the party president as soon as possible.

In order to support Kishi Nobusuke, the "mainstream faction" held a meeting on the 16th, demanding that the LDP convention be held on January 24th to re-elect the president, and submitted this request to the LDP leadership. On the other hand, the "anti-mainstream faction" of the LDP also convened a meeting today, reaffirming its attitude of opposing the early election of the party president and not compromising with the "mainstream faction." They still demanded that the president be elected in March as originally scheduled, and discussed ways to deal with the "mainstream faction" with the party elders. The "anti-mainstream faction" believes that Kishi Nobusuke's position is weakening, and electing the president in March is more conducive to their plan to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke.

Kishi Nobusuke convened a meeting of party leaders on the 16th to discuss the issue of electing the president. He said at the meeting, "Because the situation inside and outside the party is urgent, I want to elect the president as soon as possible and try to stabilize the political situation." However, Masuya Hideji, Chairman of the General Council of the LDP and member of the "anti-mainstream faction," said "avoid drawing conclusions immediately" to Kishi Nobusuke's request.

On the issue of re-electing the LDP president, the opinions of the "mainstream faction" and the "anti-mainstream faction" have reached another stalemate. Therefore, the meeting of LDP leaders had no choice but to decide to reconvene the meeting of LDP leaders on the 19th to decide on the issue of electing the president after a meeting between Ohno Banboku of the "mainstream faction" and Masuya Hideji of the "anti-mainstream faction" on January 17th.

According to "Kyodo News," Kishi Nobusuke's direct line has made up its mind that if the new executive body of the LDP cannot reach an agreement on the date of the presidential re-election, Kishi Nobusuke will resign as party president before the party convention is held, creating a situation where a presidential election is inevitable.

Radio Japan said that the internal contradictions of the LDP have resurfaced in a serious situation, and the Japanese political situation is becoming increasingly tense.

### 岸信介集团企图强行提前重选总裁  日本自由民主党内斗争仍烈

    岸信介集团企图强行提前重选总裁
    日本自由民主党内斗争仍烈
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本执政党内部的派系斗争一波未伏，一波又起。1月14日，日本自由民主党“反主流派”表示坚决反对以岸信介为首的“主流派”强行要提前重新选举总裁。两派之间的斗争正在激烈地进行着。
    自从去年年底自由民主党的“主流”与“反主流”两派达成暂时妥协的局面后，岸信介就想通过更换自由民主党领导人员和局部改组内阁的办法来缓和“主流派”和“反主流派”的矛盾。它并且打算在“反主流派”内部还没有统一步调之前，把应该在3月重选总裁的党大会提前到1月举行，以便重任总裁，设法暂时稳定政局，渡过国会会议的难关。
      “主流派”和“反主流派”经过一系列紧张的折冲后，1月10日由大野伴睦代表自由民主党总裁岸信介在总务会会议上指定“主流派”的福田赳夫（岸信介派）为干事长，中村梅吉（河野一郎派）为政务调查会长，增田甲子七（佐藤荣作派）为国会对策委员会委员长，“反主流派”的益谷秀次（池田勇人派）和竹山祐太郎（三木武夫—松村谦三派）分别得到总务会长和全国组织委员会委员长的职位。党纪委员会委员长的人选，将由党大会决定。1月12日，岸信介局部改组了内阁。在新任命的人选中，“主流派”的桥本龙五（佐藤荣作派、原任厚生相）担任文部相，伊能繁次郎（岸信介派）担任“防卫厅”长官，“反主流派”的世耕弘一（石桥湛山派）担任经济企划厅长官，坂田道太（石井光次郎派）担任厚生相。由于“反主流派”的首脑之一石井光次郎坚决拒绝参加内阁，池田勇人辞去的国务相职位依然悬缺。
    经过这番更换自由民主党领导人员和局部改组内阁后，“主流”和“反主流”两派之间出现了一个“不稳定的均势”。但是，这并没有能够平息自由民主党内部的斗争。
    从自由民主党各派势力在内阁改组及党内人事分配的表现上可以看出，不仅是石井光次郎本人由于岸信介没有接受“反主流派”的大规模改组内阁的要求而拒绝参加内阁，在“反主流派”中有势力的池田派和三木——松村派也没有被包括在改组后的内阁中。在党的领导机构的新的人选中没有石桥派的份。
    岸信介16日在内阁例会上承认他在政府和自由民主党内的地位都不稳，因此他焦急地想尽早通过重新当选党总裁来应付日益加深的危机。
    为了支持岸信介，“主流派”16日举行会议，要求在1月24日举行自由民主党大会重新选举总裁，并且向自由民主党的领导机构提出了这项要求。另一方面，自由民主党的“反主流派”今天也召集会议，再次肯定了反对提前选举党总裁和不同“主流派”妥协的态度，他们仍然要求按原定日期在3月选举总裁，并且和党内的元老讨论了应付“主流派”的办法。“反主流派”认为，岸信介的地位正在日益削弱，3月选举总裁对他们推翻岸信介的计划更为有利。
    岸信介16日召开了党内首脑人物的会议，讨论选举总裁问题。他在会上说，“因为党内外的形势紧迫，所以我想早日选举总裁，设法稳定政局。”但是，自由民主党总务会长、“反主流派”的益谷秀次对岸信介的要求表示“避免立即做出结论”。
    在重新选举自由民主党总裁问题上，“主流派”和“反主流派”的意见又出现了僵持的局面。因此，自由民主党的首脑人物会议只好决定在1月17日由“主流派”的大野伴睦和“反主流派”的益谷秀次举行会谈之后，19日重新召开自由民主党首脑人物会议来决定选举总裁问题。
    据“共同社”报道，岸信介的嫡系已经下定决心，如果自由民主党新的执行机构不能就重选总裁日期问题达成协议的话，岸信介就要在举行党大会以前辞去党总裁的职务，造成非举行总裁选举不可的形势。
    日本电台说，自由民主党的内部矛盾再次呈现严重局面，日本政局正在越来越紧张。
