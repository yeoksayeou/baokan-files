Prime Minister Grotewohl's Speech

Dear Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai,
Dear Comrades and Friends:

We thank you for your warm hospitality here. At the invitation of the People's Republic of China, I am leading a government delegation on its second visit to your beautiful country. I am very happy because this visit provides another opportunity to further deepen the existing personal contacts with your party and state leaders and the Chinese working people, and to establish new contacts.

I take this opportunity to express my special gratitude for Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech, which proves how profound the Chinese friends' understanding of the world situation is.

Such personal contact is indispensable for mutual understanding and is an effective way to further develop and deepen relations between countries. Friendship is not a vague abstraction; it is a matter of living, breathing people in the real world. People should not only talk about friendship but also act in the spirit of this noble cause.

This experience has also been confirmed during our visits to Cairo, Baghdad, New Delhi, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam before coming here. This visit contributes to understanding and peace. Please allow me to briefly evaluate our visit politically. Before starting the evaluation, I would like to thank the governments of all the countries we visited for their hospitality.

In my talks with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic, we reached an agreement to deepen our friendly relations by establishing consulates general. This agreement is an important step on the road to expanding our mutual cooperation. Further development and deepening of the existing friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the United Arab Republic, and further consolidation of cooperation in all aspects, should be seen as a contribution to safeguarding peace.

The joint statement issued by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq and myself in Baghdad reads as follows regarding the relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Republic of Iraq:

"In order to further deepen the lasting friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Republic of Iraq, both sides, on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, agree to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Republic of Iraq and the mutual dispatch of political representatives when appropriate."

My talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru were also filled with a spirit of understanding. We both agreed that international disputes must be resolved gradually and through peaceful consultation. Any attempt to impose one's will on others cannot solve problems and will only exacerbate existing tensions. In accordance with these principles, all efforts aimed at enabling the early conclusion of a peace treaty should be welcomed. The German question should also be resolved through peaceful consultation.

The great achievement of our visits to these three countries lies first of all in proving once again the realization of the principles of peaceful coexistence and its significance for safeguarding peace. World peace is impossible without resolving the German question. Therefore, the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is a visionary solution beneficial to world peace. However, it is impossible to conclude an all-German peace treaty without recognizing the two German states. The Bonn government's attempts to diplomatically isolate the German Democratic Republic must be crushed. We have achieved the goals of our visit to a greater extent. The international prestige of the German Democratic Republic has been significantly enhanced during our visit. The Bonn clerical militarist government's attempts to diplomatically encircle the German Democratic Republic have failed.

In addition, we have consolidated and deepened our friendly and fraternal relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The joint statement issued by us and our Vietnamese friends points out that the delegations of the two governments are extremely satisfied to see that they have reached a complete consensus on all the issues discussed above.

We are convinced that our visit to the People's Republic of China, like our visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, will contribute to consolidating our relations on the basis of socialist internationalism. Therefore, our entire visit has contributed to new and further understanding among the peoples of all countries, to strengthening peace, understanding, and the forces of socialism, and to our people's national struggle for the peaceful and democratic restoration of German unity.

I propose a toast:

To the further implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence,

To understanding between the peoples of all countries,

To the unbreakable friendship, fraternal cooperation, and solidarity of the invincible socialist family headed by the Soviet Union,

To further and closer cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, to our unbreakable friendship, to the happiness, prosperity, and peace of the peoples of all countries,

To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong,

To the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai,

To the great, heroic, and powerful Chinese people!

### 格罗提渥总理的讲话

专栏：

    格罗提渥总理的讲话亲爱的周恩来总理同志：亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我们感谢你们在这里对我们的热诚招待。应中华人民共和国的邀请，我率领政府代表团第二次访问你们美丽的祖国。我很高兴，因为这次访问又有机会进一步加深同你们党和国家领导人以及中国劳动人民的已有的个人接触，并建立新的接触。
    我趁这个机会对周恩来同志的讲话，表示特别的感谢。周恩来同志的讲话，证明中国朋友对世界局势有着多么深刻的了解。
    这种个人接触对于相互谅解说来是不可缺少的，并且是进一步发展并加深国与国之间关系的有效办法。友谊不是虚无飘渺的抽象理论，它是地球上实际生活中的活生生的人的事情，人们不能光谈友谊，而且应该本着这种高尚事情的精神行动。
    这条经验也在我们经过开罗、巴格达、新德里和越南民主共和国到你们这里访问期间得到证实。这次访问有助于谅解与和平。请允许我简短地从政治上评价一下我们的这次访问。在开始评价以前，我向所有我们访问过的国家的政府所给予我们的款待表示感谢。
    在我同阿拉伯联合共和国总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔举行的会谈中，我们达成了通过建立总领事馆加深我们友好关系的协议。这个协议是在扩大我们相互合作的道路上的一个重要步骤。德意志民主共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国之间已有的友好关系的进一步发展和加深以及各方面的合作的进一步巩固，应当看作是对保障和平的一个贡献。
    伊拉克共和国总理和我在巴格达发表的联合声明对德意志民主共和国和伊拉克共和国之间的关系是这样写的：
    “为了进一步加深德意志民主共和国和伊拉克共和国之间的持久的友好关系，双方在互相尊重主权和独立的基础上，同意讨论在适当的情况下德意志民主共和国和伊拉克共和国建立外交关系并互派政治代表的问题。”
    我同印度总理尼赫鲁的会谈，也充满了谅解的精神，我们两人一致认为：必须逐步地并且用和平协商的方法解决国际争端。想把自己的意志强加于人的任何企图，不能解决问题，并会使现有的紧张局势加剧。根据这些原则，目的在于使和约能够早日缔结的一切努力都应该受到欢迎。德国问题应当同样用和平协商的方法来解决。
  我们在这三个国家访问的巨大成就首先在于再次证明了和平共处原则的实现及其对保卫和平的意义。不解决德国问题，实现世界和平是不可能的。因此，苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议是一种有利于全世界和平的有远见的解决办法。可是不承认两个德国，就不可能缔结全德和约。波恩政府在外交上孤立德意志民主共和国的企图必须粉碎。我们在更广泛的程度上达到了我们访问的目的。德意志民主共和国的国际威信在我们访问期间已获得显著的提高。波恩教权军国主义政府企图对德意志民主共和国进行的外交包围，已遭到失败。
    此外，我们巩固和加深了与越南民主共和国的友好和兄弟般的关系。我们与越南朋友发表的联合声明指出：两国政府代表团极其满意地看到，双方对上述所讨论的一切问题取得了完全一致的看法。
    我们确信，我们在中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国的访问一样，将有助于在社会主义国际主义的基础上巩固我们的关系。因此，我们的整个访问对各国人民的新的和进一步的谅解，对加强和平、谅解和社会主义的力量作出了贡献，并有助于我们人民争取和平民主恢复德国统一的民族斗争。
    我建议，
    为和平共处原则的进一步贯彻，
    为各国人民之间的谅解，
    为以苏联为首的不可战胜的社会主义大家庭牢不可破的友谊，兄弟般的合作和团结一致，
    为德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的进一步的更紧密的合作，为我们牢不可破的友谊、各国人民的幸福、繁荣和和平，
    为毛泽东同志的健康，
    为周恩来同志的健康，
    为伟大、英勇、强大的中国人民，干杯！
