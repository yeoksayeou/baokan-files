    Rosin
    Rosin is processed and refined from pine resin. When the bark of a pine tree is scraped away, a colorless, transparent, oily liquid flows from the tree's sap ducts, which is pine resin. Generally, pine resin contains about 80% rosin and about 20% turpentine. The pine resin is placed in a distillation pot, the turpentine is extracted, impurities are removed, and a yellow, transparent, solid rosin can be obtained.
    Rosin is an industrial raw material with a wide range of uses. It is an indispensable material in industries such as soap, paper, paint, and matches. An average of 154 kilograms is required to manufacture one ton of soap, 12 kilograms are required to manufacture one ton of paper, and about 1,110 kilograms are required to manufacture 10,000 matches. Rosin also has certain uses in rubber, metallurgy, electrical manufacturing, petroleum, textiles, food, printing, medicine, and the construction industry. After being dry distilled, rosin can also be used to manufacture gasoline substitutes, diesel, and machine lubricating oil.
    Before liberation, due to the exploitation of the reactionary rule, the quantity of China's pine resin products was small and the quality was low. High-grade rosin needed domestically had to be imported, averaging around 3,000 tons per year. After liberation, due to the Party's emphasis on the development of the rosin industry, not only has the quantity of products greatly increased, but the quality has also reached a very high level. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, China's rosin production reached 120,000 tons, exceeding any year in history. However, with the rapid increase in the demand for rosin as industrial and agricultural production develops, the rosin industry must have an even greater leap forward in 1959.
    China is rich in rosin resources, and pine trees are distributed throughout the country. However, at present, rosin production is mainly concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Hunan. Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou have many pine forests, and the Northeast region has even more abundant pine forests, but pine resin and rosin production are not yet widespread. In order to rapidly develop China's rosin industrial production and meet the needs of national construction, these regions should actively develop new rosin production bases, promoting a greater leap forward in China's rosin production.

    松香
    松香是由松脂加工提炼成的。松树刮去树皮，从树干的管道里流出无色透明的油状液体，就是松脂。一般松脂中含有松香80％左右，松节油20％左右。将松脂放在蒸馏锅里蒸馏，取出松节油，除去杂质，就可以得到黄色透明的固体松香。
    松香是一种工业原料，用途很广，在肥皂、造纸、油漆、火柴等工业上都是必不可少的材料，制造一吨肥皂平均需用一百五十四公斤，制造一吨纸平均需用十二公斤，制造一万件火柴约需一千一百一十公斤。松香在橡胶、冶金、电器制造、石油、纺织、食品、印刷、医药以及建筑工业上也都有一定用途。松香干馏后，还可以制造汽油的代用品、柴油和机器润滑油。
    在解放前，由于反动统治的压榨，我国的松脂产品数量少质量低，国内需要的高级松香，要靠国外输入，平均每年进口三千吨左右。解放后，由于党对发展松香工业的重视，不仅产品数量大量增加，质量也达到了很高水平。在大跃进的1958年，我国的松香产量达十二万吨，超过历史上任何一年。但是，随着工农业生产发展对松香需要量的迅速增加，松香工业在1959年还必须要有更大的跃进。
    我国松香资源丰富，松树的分布遍及全国各地。但目前松香生产主要集中在广东、广西、福建、湖南等省，四川、云南、贵州松林很多，东北地区松林更为丰富，可是松脂和松香生产还很不普遍。为了迅速发展我国的松香工业生产，满足国家建设需要，这些地区应该积极开发新的松香生产基地，促使我国的松香生产更大的跃进。（附图片）
