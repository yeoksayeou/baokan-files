To guarantee a large increase in the production of iron, steel, coal and copper, Gansu Province has begun to vigorously repair roads leading to iron mines, coal mines, copper mines, and steel plants, striving to transform the simple roads built during the Great Leap Forward in steelmaking last year into wide, flat, and unobstructed formal highways in a short period, in order to improve the efficiency of automobile transportation.

Last year, the province of Gansu built more than 4,000 kilometers of simple roads in many barren mining and iron-smelting areas. After several months of busy transportation, these simple roads have suffered considerable damage to the road surface, becoming rough and difficult to travel. Although the province has concentrated more than half of its vehicles on these roads, it still cannot complete the transportation tasks well due to low transportation efficiency.

This year, the province's production of steel, coal, copper, etc., will have an even greater leap forward than last year. The province's road transport tasks this year will increase by more than double that of last year. Taking advantage of the fact that the busiest transportation season has not yet arrived, the Provincial Department of Transportation has decided to seize the time and carry out a more thorough repair of the simple roads leading to industrial and mining areas. At present, all parts of the province have organized manpower to participate in the repair work. The steep slopes of the roads are being eased, the rough road surfaces are being filled in, and single lanes are being turned into double lanes. Some sections will also undergo asphalt and soil-cement surface treatment. (Guo Fenxiang)

    保证钢铁煤铜大增产
    甘肃整修通向工矿区的道路
    本报讯　甘肃省开始大力整修通向铁矿、煤矿、铜矿和钢铁厂的道路，争取短期内把去年大炼钢铁时修成的简易公路，改建成广阔、平坦、畅通无阻的正式公路，以便提高汽车运输效率。
    去年甘肃全省在许多荒凉的矿山和炼铁地区修起了总长四千多公里的简易公路。这些简易公路经过几个月来的繁忙运输，路面损耗很大，崎岖不平，行车困难。全省虽然集中了一半以上的汽车在这些公路上行驶，但是因为运输效率低，仍旧不能很好地完成运输任务。
    今年，全省的钢铁、煤、铜等的生产，将比去年有更大的跃进。全省今年的公路运输任务要比去年增加一倍多。趁着最繁忙的运输季节还没有到来，省交通厅决定抓紧时间，把通向工矿区的简易公路进行一次比较彻底的整修。现在，全省各地已组织人力参加整修工作。公路陡急的坡度正在改缓，崎岖的路面正在填平，单车道正变成双车道。有的地段还要进行沥青、土水泥表面处理。　　　　（郭汾祥）
