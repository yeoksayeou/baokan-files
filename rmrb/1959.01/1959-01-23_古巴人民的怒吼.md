    The Power of the People
    The victory of the Cuban people's armed struggle in overthrowing the Batista dictatorial regime, a proxy of U.S. imperialism, is another significant victory in the surging national independence movement.
    The Cuban armed uprising led by Castro has consistently received strong support from Cuban workers, farmers, and other patriotic individuals from all walks of life. The working class, its political parties, and trade unions launched successive strikes and participated in the uprising forces, waging a determined struggle against the Batista regime. Wherever the uprising forces went, more than 30,000 farmers and agricultural workers rose up in succession, supplying the forces with grain or enthusiastically joining the army. It was precisely because of the support and participation of the masses that the uprising forces were able to grow from weak to strong, from small to large, continuously expand guerrilla zones, repeatedly break through the "encirclement and suppression" and "offensive" of the powerful Batista government army, until they achieved national victory.
    When the victorious rebel army marched towards Havana, the capital of Cuba, the working class of Havana held a general strike to help the rebel army quickly destroy the dictatorship. The Cuban People's Socialist Party, many trade unions, and various mass organizations supported this general strike. After the establishment of the interim government, various revolutionary political parties and organizations in Cuba, as well as the broad masses of people, held rallies and demonstrations to celebrate the victory of overthrowing the dictatorial regime. People everywhere actively participated in the work of eliminating Batista's remnants and maintaining social order. When the U.S. imperialist propaganda machine and congressmen clamored for intervention in Cuba's suppression of Batista's remnants, the Cuban people closely united around the interim government and resolutely opposed U.S. intervention.
    The unprecedented massive demonstration of one million people in the Cuban capital on January 21st against U.S. intervention was the culmination of the Cuban people's struggle to resolutely oppose U.S. intervention.
    The solidarity of patriotic and democratic forces and the increasing awareness of the masses are prominent features of the Cuban national democratic revolution.
    Progressive Measures of the Interim Government
    The victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the Batista regime has opened up broad avenues for Cuba's development on the path of independence and democracy.
    After the Cuban rebel army entered Havana, the capital, it announced the appointment of Dr. Urrutia, a former judge, as interim president, established an interim government, and formed a national "National Unity" committee composed of twenty-four members, mostly representatives of domestic patriotic and democratic forces, to manage national affairs.
    The Cuban interim government first took many positive measures to destroy the Batista state apparatus and punish Batista's remnants who had committed serious crimes. The cabinet meeting held on January 6 announced the dissolution of the old Congress. The cabinet also ordered the dissolution of the special court of the former Batista dictatorial regime, removed all governors, mayors, and members of parliament of the former dictatorial regime, and reorganized and appointed ambassadors abroad. Criminals who had committed treason and murdered Cuban revolutionaries were arrested, and after interrogation and verification, were sentenced or executed according to the circumstances of their crimes.
    The new Cuban government effectively established social order and adopted some democratic measures. It quickly lifted martial law, restored constitutional freedoms and trade union rights, abolished censorship, and announced that it would hold free elections within a year and a half to two years. Political exiles who had been exiled during Batista's rule have returned to the country one after another, including Lázaro Peña, Secretary-General of the Cuban Workers' Confederation and Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions. All political parties (including the Cuban People's Socialist Party) and organizations that had been declared illegal by the Batista regime have been able to operate openly. The People's Socialist Party's newspaper, "Hoy," was also republished on January 9. In an interview with a reporter from Uruguay's "El País," Urrutia said that the new government "will restore the constitution that was in effect before Batista came to power, which allows the existence of the Communist Party."
    In terms of foreign policy, Cuban Interim Government Prime Minister Cardona announced that Cuba would establish diplomatic relations with all countries, including the Soviet Union (Note: Cuba severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union after Batista came to power in 1952). Castro announced at a mass rally in Havana that "Cuba not only demands political freedom, but also economic freedom." Therefore, Cuba will demand the "revision and abolition" of various privileges granted to foreign enterprises by the former Batista government. As for Cuba's relationship with the United States, Castro said in a speech warning the United States not to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs: "We want to maintain good relations with the United States - yes. But submission - impossible."
    Resolutely Oppose U.S. Interference in Internal Affairs
    The victory of the Cuban people's anti-dictatorial struggle and the development of the Cuban situation after the victory in a direction favorable to the Cuban people and national interests have greatly alarmed U.S. imperialism, which, under the pretext of the Cuban interim government's sanctions against criminals, has brutally and shamelessly interfered in Cuba's internal affairs.
    In order to implement democratic reforms domestically, consolidate the fruits of victory, and prevent Batista's conspiracy to restore his rule, the Cuban interim government, at the request and with the support of the Cuban people, cleansed internal enemies and punished criminals who had betrayed and murdered the people, who were heavily in debt for blood and whose crimes were irrefutable. These are completely necessary and just measures. Everyone knows that Batista's seventeen years of bloody rule turned Cuba into a fascist concentration camp and slaughterhouse. More than 20,000 innocent people have been killed in the last seven years alone! Even the "New York Times" correspondent in Havana said that it is difficult to find a family in Cuba that has not been harmed by the Batista dictatorial regime. However, the "humanitarian" congressmen of the U.S. government and the U.S. propaganda machine, which claims to "defend democratic dignity," have never criticized Batista once. But when the Cuban interim government punished these Batista executioners who had committed heinous crimes against the Cuban people, the U.S. propaganda machine and congressmen insisted that the Cuban new government's punitive measures were "inhumane" and "undemocratic," demanding that the U.S. government "sanction" Cuba; and Rubottom, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, openly threatened the Cuban interim government, asking "Cuban authorities to consider American public opinion."
    At this time, the U.S. State Department, with a guilty conscience, issued a statement saying that "the U.S. policy toward the Cuban revolution has always been a strict policy of non-interference in Cuba's internal affairs." However, last July, the United States sent Marines to land in Cuba, exposing its conspiracy to directly intervene in the Cuban revolution by armed force; this movement to attack the new Cuban government is an attempt to strangle the Cuban interim government. This can absolutely not be concealed by a piece of paper full of lies.
    The reason why U.S. imperialism is interfering at all costs is to maintain its interests in Cuba. The United States has $1 billion in direct investment in Cuba, controlling 90% of Cuba's sugar and coffee plantations, 80% of its foreign trade, and the entire electricity, transportation, and mining industries. The United States also occupies a naval base in Cuba. The United States is trying to continue to enslave the victorious Cuban people.
    However, the Cuban people will not yield to U.S. imperialism. The Cuban people's massive mass movement against U.S. intervention is a powerful answer to U.S. imperialism.

    古巴人民的怒吼
    关达
    人民群众的威力
    古巴人民推翻美帝国主义代理人巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装斗争的胜利，是风起云涌的民族独立运动的又一重大胜利。
    卡斯特罗领导的古巴武装起义，自始至终得到了古巴工人、农民和其他阶层爱国者的有力支持。工人阶级及其政党和工会发动此起彼伏的罢工，并参加起义部队，为反对巴蒂斯塔政权进行了坚决的斗争。起义部队所到之地，先后有三万多农民和农业工人揭竿而起，供给部队以粮食，或者踊跃参军。正是由于人民群众的支持和参加，起义部队才得以从弱到强，由小变大，不断扩大游击区，一再冲破强大的巴蒂斯塔政府军的“围剿”和“进攻”，直至取得全国的胜利。
    当胜利的起义军向古巴首都哈瓦那进军的时候，哈瓦那的工人阶级举行了总罢工，帮助起义军迅速摧毁独裁统治。古巴人民社会党、许多工会和各种群众团体支持了这次总罢工。临时政府成立后，古巴各革命政党和团体以及广泛阶层的人民群众纷纷举行集会和游行示威，欢呼推翻独裁政权的胜利。各地人民积极参加了肃清巴蒂斯塔残余分子和维护社会秩序的工作。当美帝国主义宣传机器和议员发出干涉古巴镇压巴蒂斯塔残余分子的叫嚣时，古巴人民紧密地团结在临时政府的周围，坚决反对美国的干涉。
    1月21日古巴首都一百万人民举行的反对美国干涉的空前大示威，是古巴人民坚决反对美国干涉的斗争的高潮。
    爱国民主力量的团结和人民群众觉悟的日益高涨，是古巴民族民主革命的显著的特点。
    临时政府的进步措施
    古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔政权的胜利，为古巴在独立和民主道路上的发展打开了广阔的道路。
    古巴起义部队进入首都哈瓦那后，宣布由前法官乌鲁蒂亚博士为临时总统，成立了临时政府，并成立一个由大部分国内爱国民主力量的代表参加的、二十四个委员组成的国家“全国联合”委员会，来管理全国事务。
    古巴临时政府首先对摧毁巴蒂斯塔国家机器和惩处犯有严重罪行的巴蒂斯塔残余分子，采取了许多积极措施。1月6日举行的内阁会议宣布解散旧的国会。内阁还下令解散了前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的特别法庭，解除了前独裁政权所有省长、市长和议员的职务，改组和任命了驻外使节。对于犯有叛国罪和杀害古巴革命者罪行的罪犯，加以逮捕，并经审讯和证实后，按情节分别予以判刑或处决。
    古巴新政府有效地建立了社会秩序，采取了一些民主措施。它很快地取消了戒严令，恢复宪法自由和工会权利，取消新闻检查，并宣布将在一年半到两年内举行自由选举。在巴蒂斯塔统治时期政治流亡人士都已纷纷回国，其中包括古巴工人联合会总书记、世界工会联合会书记拉萨罗·培尼亚。被巴蒂斯塔政权宣布非法的各政党（包括古巴人民社会党在内）和团体都已公开活动。人民社会党的机关报“今日报”也在1月9日复刊。乌鲁蒂亚在对乌拉圭“国家报”记者的谈话中说，新政府“将恢复巴蒂斯塔当政以前所行使的宪法，这个宪法是允许共产党存在的”。
    在外交政策方面，古巴临时政府总理卡多纳宣布，古巴将同所有国家建立外交关系，其中包括苏联（按：古巴是在1952年巴蒂斯塔上台后与苏联绝交的）。卡斯特罗在哈瓦那的群众大会上宣布，“古巴不但要求政治上的自由，而且也要求经济上的自由”，因此，古巴将要求“修改和废除”前巴蒂斯塔政府所给予外国企业的各种特权。至于古巴对美国的关系，卡斯特罗在一次警告美国不要干预古巴内政的演说中表示：“我们希望同美国保持良好关系——对的。但是，屈服——办不到”。
    坚决反对美国干涉内政
    古巴人民反独裁斗争的胜利和胜利后的古巴局势向有利于古巴人民和民族利益的方向发展，使美帝国主义大为恐慌，竟借口古巴临时政府制裁犯罪分子，对古巴内政进行粗暴无耻的干涉。
    古巴临时政府为了在国内实行民主改革、巩固已经取得的胜利果实、防止巴蒂斯塔阴谋复辟，在古巴人民的要求和支持下，清洗内部敌人，惩治那些叛变和杀害人民的血债累累、罪证确凿的犯罪分子，是完全必要的正义措施。大家知道，巴蒂斯塔的十七年血腥统治，把古巴变成了一个法西斯集中营和屠场。单是最近七年中被杀害的无辜人民就达二万多！甚至连“纽约时报”驻哈瓦那的记者也说，在古巴很难找到一个不曾受到巴蒂斯塔独裁政权危害的家庭。但是美国政府的“人道主义”议员以及以“维护民主尊严”自居的美国宣传机器，却从来没有对巴蒂斯塔指责过一次。而当古巴临时政府惩办这些对古巴人民犯下滔天罪行的巴蒂斯塔刽子手时，美国的宣传机器、议员却硬说古巴新政府的惩治措施“不人道”和“不民主”，要求美国政府“制裁”古巴；而美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿鲁博姆竟公然威胁古巴临时政府，要“古巴当局考虑美国的舆论”。
    正在这个时候，美国国务院却作贼心虚地发表一篇声明，说什么
  “美国对古巴的革命的政策一直是严格的不干涉古巴内政的政策”。但是，去年7月间美国就曾派遣海军陆战队在古巴登陆，暴露了它企图对古巴的革命进行直接武装干涉的阴谋；这次发动的攻击古巴新政府的运动，则是企图扼杀古巴临时政府。这都绝对不是一纸谎言所能掩盖的。
    美帝国主义所以不顾一切地进行干涉，是为了保持它在古巴的利益。美国在古巴有十亿美元的直接投资，控制了古巴90％的糖和咖啡种植园，80％的对外贸易以及整个电力、交通运输和采矿业。美国还在古巴占有海军基地。美国企图继续奴役胜利了的古巴人民。
    但是，古巴人民是不会向美帝国主义屈服的。古巴人民声势浩大的反对美国干涉的群众运动，就是给予美帝国主义的一个有力回答。
