Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 14th: Taipei News: A sharp struggle between the United States and the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities continues to develop. The "Free China Semi-Monthly," published by pro-American figures Hu Shih, Lei Chen, and others with American support, openly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's continued re-election as "President" in its latest New Year's special issue editorial, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek step down quickly. This magazine, reflecting Washington's intentions, insisted that Chiang Kai-shek's remarks at a meeting on December 23rd, that "many National Assembly representatives advocate amending the constitution, which he is not in a position to interfere with, but he personally has no intention of amending the constitution and opposes amending it," was tantamount to Chiang Kai-shek "clearly expressing his refusal to run for re-election," and used a threatening tone, saying, "This is already a final decision that can no longer be changed."

At the same time, this magazine vigorously touted the "benefits" of the American military's accelerated direct control over Taiwan and the large-scale reduction of Chiang's army's standing forces. It also clamored for the organization of a so-called "powerful opposition party" in Taiwan, hostile to the Kuomintang.

The anti-Chiang activities of pro-American elements in Taiwan, instigated by the United States, have been met with fierce counterattacks from the Taiwan Kuomintang. The Taiwan Kuomintang's "Political Commentary Semi-Monthly" recently published many articles refuting the "Free China Semi-Monthly," and openly cursed the "Free China Semi-Monthly" in its "Editor's Notes" as "a magazine run by Chinese who follow the United States in everything and have openly demanded that the United States interfere in internal affairs." This official Taiwan Kuomintang publication also listed the facts of the annual increase in murder, theft, robbery, rape, arson, and other cases in the United States in a short article entitled "Social Problems in the United States," and then scolded the pro-American elements in Taiwan, saying, "How do the Chinese who have praised liberalism and capitalism to the skies explain and solve these problems? Their only way is to close their eyes and only talk about the benefits of the United States."

The pro-Chiang Taiwan "United News" semi-monthly recently called on the Taiwan authorities to "maintain vigilance and take strict precautions." It wrote that the current "situation on the international diplomatic and political battlefield is treacherous and unpredictable, with countercurrents emerging one after another. Various undercurrents unfavorable to us (referring to the Taiwan authorities) exist at all times in the United Nations, in Washington, and in London, waiting for an opportunity to rise. Especially in foreign newspapers and magazines and in news telegrams, there are almost daily statements unfavorable to us, the extent of their absurdity and ignorance, the insidiousness and viciousness of their intentions, and the slander of making something out of nothing are truly appalling." It advised the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities to control their own future and not to be too dependent on others, lest disaster strike.

    美蒋之间斗争日益尖锐
    美国策动台湾亲美分子加紧逼蒋介石下台
    国民党方面展开猛烈反击高呼要提高警觉
    新华社广州14日电　台北消息：美国同台湾国民党当局的一场尖锐斗争，正在继续发展。亲美分子胡适、雷震等在美国支持下出版的“自由中国半月刊”，在最近一期新年特刊上发表社论，公开提出反对蒋介石继续连任“总统”，要蒋介石赶快下台。这家反映华盛顿方面意图的杂志硬说，蒋介石在上月23日一次会上提到的“许多国大代表主张修改宪法他不便干涉，但他本人无意修宪并反对修宪”的话，就是等于蒋介石“明确的表示了拒绝连任”，并且用威逼的口吻说：“这已经是无法再有所变更的最后决定了”。
    同时，这家杂志竭力吹嘘由美军加紧对台湾直接控制而大量裁减蒋军常备军的“好处”。它还叫喊在台湾组织以国民党为敌手的所谓“强大的反对党”。
    台湾亲美分子在美国策动下进行的反蒋活动，受到了台湾国民党方面的猛烈反击。台湾国民党的“政治评论半月刊”最近登载了许多反驳“自由中国半月刊”的文章，而且在“编后记”里公开骂“自由中国半月刊”是“处处跟着美国走并且曾经公然要求美国干涉内政的中国人办的杂志”，这本台湾国民党官方刊物，还在一篇题为“美国底社会问题”的短文中，列举了美国的谋杀、盗窃、抢劫、强奸、放火等案件年年增加的事实，然后斥骂台湾的亲美分子说，“把自由主义和资本主义歌颂得了不起的中国人，对于这些问题怎样解释和解决呢？他们唯一办法就是闭着眼睛而只把美国底好处拿来说。”
    亲蒋的台湾“联合新闻”半月刊最近要求台湾当局“保持警觉，严加防范”。它写道，目前“国际外交政治战场上的风云险恶万端，逆流迭现，各种不利于我们（指台湾当局）的暗流，在联合国、在华盛顿、在伦敦，无时无刻都存在着，无时无刻不在俟机而起。尤其在国外报章杂志上及新闻电讯中，不利于我们的言论，几乎无日不有，其荒谬无知之程度，其阴险恶毒之居心，其无中生有之诬蔑，看来真令人发指。”它劝告台湾国民党当局自己掌握前途，不要过分俯仰由人以免大祸临头。
