The Soviet Union's 1,472-kilogram cosmic rocket, after breaking through the Earth's and Moon's gravity, officially entered the solar system's planetary orbit on the 7th, becoming the first artificial planet. This is another epoch-making achievement after the artificial Earth satellite. If artificial Earth satellites represent the first stage of interstellar navigation, then the birth of artificial planets marks the second stage of interstellar navigation. This means that mankind has mastered the necessary tools to reach the universe.

The difference between a cosmic rocket and a satellite-launching rocket lies in the former's greater weight and stronger power. The Soviet Union launched a total of three satellites from October 4, 1957, the heaviest of which weighed about 1,327 kilograms. The thrust of the rocket that launched such a satellite was approximately 1,000 tons. To launch a planet weighing almost one and a half tons, the rocket must have the power to allow the final stage to escape Earth's gravity, and its thrust must be around 10,000 tons. If launching a satellite requires a three-stage rocket, then a cosmic rocket must have at least four stages. The successful launch of such a heavy planet allows us to conclude that the Soviet Union has solved the problem of landing on the Moon in terms of rocket engine technology.

The reason why cosmic rockets need to be particularly powerful is that they have to send a payload of more than a ton out of the gravitational range of the Earth and Moon. We know that Earth satellites orbit the Earth in circular or near-circular orbits under the influence of Earth's gravity. The speed of operation on such an orbit is approximately eight kilometers per second. To launch such a satellite, the rocket only needs to accelerate the final stage to the speed required for a circular orbit. The cosmic rocket must go a step further on this basis, increasing the speed to greater than 11.2 kilometers per second, i.e., the second cosmic velocity. If the speed of the rocket's final stage is less than the second cosmic velocity, it will operate within the gravitational field of the Earth and Moon, and the shape of the orbit will have many possibilities. One type suitable for interstellar transport is a flat ellipse. If its speed is equal to or exceeds the second cosmic velocity, it will fly towards the Moon in a parabolic curve. Due to its high speed, although it enters the Moon's gravitational field, it still escapes the Moon's influence and continues to rush towards space, eventually escaping the Earth-Moon's restraint, and then falling into the Sun's even stronger gravity.

Under the Sun's strong attraction, this planet gradually embarks on a new orbit. This orbit is elliptical, with the Sun as one focus. According to calculations, this small planet is running almost within the orbital plane of the Earth. The orbit lies between the orbits of the Earth and Mars, with the longest diameter of 343.6 million kilometers. This axis forms a fifteen-degree angle with the long axis of the Earth's orbit. The period is fifteen months.

A special feature of launching cosmic rockets to the Moon is how to make two moving objects meet. From the time the rocket is launched to the time it flies close to the Moon, it takes almost a day and a half. During this day and a half, the position of the Moon will also change. Therefore, the control of the launch time and direction must be extremely accurate. It is estimated that an error of one degree will cause an error of 6,000 kilometers in the apogee of the orbit. Truly, a small error leads to a great discrepancy.

According to the communique, the artificial planet carries a total of eight instruments and a radio transmitter. According to the nature of the instruments, we know that the planet will provide information in the following aspects: (1) From magnetic and radioactive measurements, we can obtain evidence about the structure and origin of the Moon. (2) Interplanetary diffuse thin dust and gas, highly radioactive cosmic rays, and frequently occurring meteor showers. If we master this type of information, we will have a further understanding of cosmic space, and it will be of great significance for finding safety measures for future interstellar navigation. (3) From the recording of radio waves, we can also accurately deduce the rocket's orbit near the Moon, and accurately obtain the Moon's mass based on the orbit. This is necessary data for designing more accurate traffic orbits between the Earth and the Moon in the future.

The Soviet Union has successfully launched an artificial planet after launching an artificial satellite in the past year. This proves that Soviet science is leaping forward at a great pace. Rockets are at the cutting edge of modern science and technology. It is a comprehensive and all-encompassing science. There are many departments, and each department still has key problems. To make a rocket successful, every link cannot be sloppy and must be solved solidly. Therefore, the success of a rocket is a sign of a high level in a wide range of scientific fields. Under the brilliance of mankind's first cosmic rocket, the Soviet Union's most advanced scientific peak is once again displayed in front of all mankind, and world peace has been further guaranteed.

    星际航行的第二阶段
    中国科学院力学研究所副所长　郭永怀
    苏联重达一千四百七十二公斤的宇宙火箭在突破地球和月球的引力以后，已于7日正式进入太阳系的行星轨道，成为第一个人造行星。这是继人造地球卫星以后又一件划时代的创举。如果人造地球卫星是星际航行的第一阶段，那么人造行星的诞生就标志着星际航行的第二阶段。这就意味着人类已经掌握了通到宇宙去的必要工具了。
    宇宙火箭与发射卫星的火箭的分野，在于前者的重量更大、力量更强。苏联从1957年10月4日起共发射三个卫星，最重的一颗约一千三百二十七公斤。发射这样卫星的火箭，推力大约在一千吨左右。发射几乎  一吨半重的行星，火箭就必须有使最后的一级逃脱地球引力的力量，它的推力就必须在万吨左右。如果发射卫星是三级火箭，宇宙火箭就最少是四级的。成功地发射这样重的行星，我们可以断定苏联在火箭发动机的技术上，已经解决了向月球降落的问题。
    宇宙火箭的所以要特别强大，是因为它要把一吨多重的载荷送出地、月引力范围之外。我们知道地球卫星是在地球引力作用之下，环绕地球在圆形或近乎圆形轨道上运行的。在这样轨道上运行的速度大约每秒八公里。发射这样的卫星，火箭只须把最后一级加速到圆形轨道所需要的速度就行了。宇宙火箭还要在这个基础上更进一步，把速度增加到大于每秒十一点二公里，即第二宇宙速度。要是火箭最后一级的速度小于第二宇宙速度，它就要在地球、月球的引力场内运行，轨道的形状是有很多可能性。适合于星际交通的一类为扁椭圆形。如果它的速度等于或超过第二宇宙速度，它就要按抛物线飞向月球。由于速度高，它虽然进入月球的引力场，但仍然摆脱月亮的影响，而继续向太空飞奔，终于逃出地、月的束缚，而后又陷于太阳的更强大的引力。
    在太阳强烈的吸引下，这颗行星便逐渐走上新的轨道。这个轨道是椭圆形的，以太阳为一焦点。据计算的结果，这个小行星几乎是在地球的轨道面内运行。轨道是介乎地球和火星的轨道之间，最长直径为三亿四千三百六十万公里。这个轴与地球轨道的长轴成十五度角。周期是十五个月。
    在向月球发射宇宙火箭的问题上，有一特点，即如何使两个运动的物体相遇。从火箭发射到它飞近月球的时间几乎是一天半，在这一天半的时间内，月球的位置也要改变。因此，在发射的时间和方向的控制上要有极高度的准确性。据估计，误差一度，轨道的远地点就有六千公里的误差，真是失之毫厘，差以千里。
    根据公报，人造行星携带的仪器共有八种及无线电发报机。按仪器的性质，我们知道行星将供给以下几方面的资料。（1）从磁性和放射性的测量，我们可以得到有关月球的结构及其来源的证据。（2）行星间弥漫稀薄的尘埃和气体，放射性很强的宇宙线，和经常出现的流星群。我们如果掌握了这类资料，我们就能对宇宙空间有进一步的了解，并且对今后星际航行寻找安全措施，将有重要意义。（3）从无线电波的记录，我们也可以准确地推出火箭在月球附近的轨道，并根据轨道计算准确地得到月球的质量。这是今后设计地月间的更精确的交通轨道所必需的数据。
    苏联在过去一年以来，在发射人造卫星之后又成功地发射了人造行星。这证明苏联的科学正以极大的步伐飞跃前进。火箭是近代科学技术的最尖端，是一门综合性强、包罗万象的科学。部门既多，而各个部门又都还存在关键性的难题。要使一支火箭成功，每一环节便都不能苟且，都要结结实实地解决的。因此，一支火箭的成功就是广泛科学领域的高度水平的标志。在人类第一支宇宙火箭的光辉照耀下，苏联的最先进的科学高峰就再一次显示在全人类面前，世界的和平又得到了一个保障。
