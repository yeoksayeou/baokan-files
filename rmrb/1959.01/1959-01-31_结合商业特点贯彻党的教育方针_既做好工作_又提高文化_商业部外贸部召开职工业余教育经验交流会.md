Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th – The Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade recently jointly convened a national experience exchange meeting in Shanghai on workers' spare-time education in urban commerce, foreign trade, and the catering service industry.

The meeting analyzed the great development of education in the national commerce and foreign trade systems. According to incomplete statistics, six provinces, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, and Zhejiang, have more than 6,200 various types of workers' spare-time schools, with enrollment accounting for about 75% of the number of employees. However, the development situation in various regions is uneven. In areas that started earlier, a high tide of mass learning movements has been set off, and some experience in running schools has been explored. In areas that started later, a mass learning movement is beginning to take shape, and there are also individual places that have not yet taken up this work.

The meeting focused on summarizing and exchanging basic experiences in implementing the Party's education policy in light of business characteristics and relying on Party leadership and adhering to the mass line in running spare-time schools on a large scale. The meeting pointed out that most regions have implemented the Party's education policy and have achieved great results. However, there is still a struggle between two lines and two methods in the work. The meeting criticized some erroneous views and emphasized that the purpose of education is to cultivate new people with communist consciousness, culture, and all-round development. Education must serve proletarian politics, and the purpose of learning is to do a better job. Therefore, workers' learning must be closely integrated with business and correctly combine the current needs of workers with future improvements. Only in this way can we both do a good job and improve culture, making the workers satisfied. The meeting also pointed out that education in the commercial sector must be combined with productive labor, and commercial workers should be organized to participate in industrial and agricultural production within a certain period.

In running spare-time schools, the two systems have basically implemented the mass line method. Under the leadership of the Party, the masses have been fully mobilized, organized to run schools, and the role of experts and relevant departments has also been brought into play.

The meeting believes that the source of teachers for workers' spare-time education should currently adopt the method of "part-time as the mainstay and full-time as a supplement," so that there are a large number of part-time teachers and a certain number of full-time teachers, while systematically training and improving teachers to form a team of teachers who are both red and expert. Regarding the issue of teaching materials, the method of mobilizing the masses to compile business course materials can be adopted. The basic course materials should be selected and supplemented according to the different requirements of ordinary school courses, so as to gradually form a relatively complete set of basic teaching materials.

Regarding the organizational form of learning, the meeting required that, according to the uneven level, different industries, and different requirements of urban commercial cadres and workers, it is advocated that high, medium, and primary levels be carried out simultaneously, and that multiple forms be carried out simultaneously. This facilitates leadership, convenience for the masses, convenient for unified time arrangement, and also facilitates close contact with reality, which can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of grassroots school running.

Regarding relying on the local Party committee, the meeting emphasized that the departments in charge of education should frequently investigate the situation, find problems, think of solutions, and report to the Party organizations at all levels, so that Party committees at all levels can strengthen leadership. Heilongjiang and Hubei provinces also introduced their experiences in this regard at the meeting.

The meeting criticized the situation in which some commercial departments did not care about the spare-time education of the employees of their affiliated units after they were decentralized, and required the departments in charge of education at all levels in the commercial system to put forward specific opinions on carrying out workers' spare-time education based on the spirit of the central government's instructions on education and in combination with the conditions of various regions, and to request approval from the local Party committee to strengthen the leadership of the commercial system over workers' spare-time education.

This meeting started with theoretical studies, studied the central government's instructions and documents on education, and adopted a form combining internal and external activities, organizing exhibitions, visits, and on-site teaching, and widely exchanged experiences in various aspects of workers' spare-time education.

More than 200 people attended the meeting, including personnel in charge of personnel and education from commercial departments and foreign trade bureaus in various provinces and cities, relevant personnel from the catering service industry, and representatives of advanced units in spare-time education.

    结合商业特点贯彻党的教育方针
    既做好工作　又提高文化
    商业部外贸部召开职工业余教育经验交流会
    新华社上海30日电　商业部、对外贸易部最近在上海联合召开了全国城市商业、对外贸易、饮食服务业的职工业余教育工作经验交流会议。
    会上分析了全国商业、对外贸易系统的教育事业大发展的情况。据不完全统计，黑龙江、辽宁、山西、河南、湖北、浙江等六个省共有各类职工业余学校六千二百余所，入学人数占职工人数的75％左右。但是各地区的发展情况不平衡，在动手较早的地区，已经掀起群众学习运动的高潮，摸索到了一些办学的经验，动手较晚的地区，正开始形成群众性的学习运动，也有个别地方还没有把这项工作抓起来的。
    会议着重总结交流了在大办业余学校中，如何结合商业特点贯彻执行党的教育工作方针以及依靠党的领导和坚持群众路线的基本经验。会议指出，大部分地区都贯彻执行了党的教育工作方针，并且已经取得了很大的成绩。但是在工作中还存在着两条道路、两种方法的斗争，会议批判了一些错误的观点，强调指出，教育的目的是培养具有共产主义觉悟的有文化的全面发展的新人，教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，学习的目的是为了把工作做得更好，因此职工学习必须紧密地跟业务结合，并且把职工目前的需要同今后的提高正确地结合起来，只有这样才能既做好工作，又提高了文化，使职工群众满意。会议同时指出，商业部门的教育必须与生产劳动相结合，要在一定时期内组织商业工作者参加工农业生产。
    在开办业余学校中，这两个系统基本上贯彻执行了群众路线的方法。在党的领导下，充分发动群众，组织群众办学，也发挥了专家与有关部门的作用。
    会议认为：职工业余教育的教员的来源，目前应采取“兼职为主，专职为辅”的办法，做到既有大量的兼职教员，又有一定数量的专职教员，同时要有计划地培养和提高教员，组成一支又红又专教员的队伍。关于教材问题，可采取发动群众编写业务课教材，基础课程教材按照不同要求参照普通学校的课程加以取舍充实，以便逐渐形成比较完整的基础教材。
    对学习的组织形式，会议要求根据城市商业干部和职工的水平不齐、行业不同、要求不一的特点，提倡高、中、初并举，多种形式并举。这样便于领导，便利群众，便于统一安排时间，也便于密切联系实际，能够充分发挥基层办学的积极性。
    关于依靠地方党委的问题，会议着重指出，主管教育的部门要经常摸情况，找问题，想办法，向各地党组织汇报，以便各级党委加强领导。黑龙江和湖北两省还在会上介绍了这方面的经验。
    会议批判了有的商业部门在所属单位下放后不过问这些单位职工的业余教育的情形，要求商业系统各级主管教育的部门，根据中央有关教育工作指示的精神，结合各地区的情况，提出进行职工业余教育的具体意见，请示当地党委批准，以加强商业系统对职工业余教育的领导。
    这次会议是从务虚入手，曾学习了中央有关教育工作的指示和文件，采取会内外活动相结合的形式，组织展览、参观、访问和举办现场教学等，广泛地交流了职工业余教育中各方面的经验。
    参加会议的有各省市商业厅局和对外贸易局负责人事、教育的人员，饮食服务业的有关人员以及业余教育的先进单位的代表等，共二百多人。
