Division of labor and responsibility, with each finding their place, has a long history. The more developed society is, the more meticulous the division of labor becomes. However, in societies based on private ownership, the means of production are concentrated in the hands of a few exploiters. The ruling class makes every effort to exploit the social division of labor to consolidate their rule, while at the same time wantonly destroying the intelligence and talent of the vast majority of workers, preventing them from obtaining their due position in the social division of labor. "Serving the public and fulfilling responsibilities" can only become a satire of that era. Only in socialist societies can the social division of labor truly achieve the goal of making the best use of people's talents and land's resources. The scope of division of labor and responsibility has greatly expanded. In factories, in mines, and on vast lands, tens of millions of workers participate in labor management and division of labor and responsibility, using their attitude as masters to fulfill their share of responsibility to society and the collective.

In the past, many mass-based labor management and division of labor and responsibility systems were established in agricultural cooperatives. People's communes are developed on the basis of agricultural cooperatives, and many of the fine traditions of agricultural cooperatives should be inherited and carried forward. The establishment and consolidation of the production responsibility system is one aspect of this.

Some people believe that people's communes are different from agricultural cooperatives. As long as we do a good job in militarizing organization, combatizing actions, and collectivizing life, plus criticism, praise, and debate, commune members will actively produce, and there is no need to establish any responsibility system. Others believe that communes should cultivate in commune members a labor attitude of no quotas and no remuneration. If we still engage in the production responsibility system and distribution according to work, it would be a regression. This view is incomplete.

Today's people's communes are indeed very different from agricultural cooperatives. However, precisely because the scale of the commune is larger, the number of people is greater, and it covers all walks of life including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, it is even more necessary to have a high degree of organization and planning, and even more necessary to establish a scientific production responsibility system. Militarizing organization, combatizing actions, and collectivizing life cannot replace the production responsibility system. Only by establishing a scientific production responsibility system on the basis of commune members' consciousness can we make the labor organization and labor management of the people's commune orderly, further exert the power of the "large" and "public" collective, and further improve labor productivity.

Of course, our production responsibility system is based on the high degree of awareness of the masses. Everyone consciously bears the responsibility of socialism, and the responsibility of division of labor and production, which is the essence of the responsibility system we are now promoting. This is also fundamentally different from all the "order" and "responsibility" of the old society.

Commune members love their people's communes, love socialism, and love the motherland. They have a high sense of responsibility as masters. This makes it possible to establish and continuously consolidate and improve various responsibility systems. Therefore, when establishing a production responsibility system, people's communes in various places must boldly mobilize the masses and fully follow the mass line. At the same time, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen the political and ideological education of commune members, so that the masses' socialist and communist consciousness becomes the most vital driving force for implementing various responsibility systems.

    分工负责　各得其所
    苏宜
    分工负责，各得其所，由来已久。社会愈发达，分工就愈细致。但是在私有制的社会里，生产资料集中在少数剥削者手里。社会分工一方面被统治者尽力利用来巩固他们的统治；另方面极大多数劳动者的聪明才智又被他们横加摧残，在社会分工中得不到应有的位置，“奉公尽责”只能成为那个时代的讽刺。只有到了社会主义社会，社会分工才真正能做到人尽其才，地尽其利。分工负责的范围大大扩展了，在工厂，在矿山，在广阔的大地上，成千万的劳动者参加到劳动管理和分工负责的行列里来，用主人翁的态度来尽他们自己对于社会和集体的一分责任。
    过去，在农业合作社里，就建立起许多群众性的劳动管理和分工负责制度。人民公社是在农业社的基础上发展起来的，农业社的许多优良传统应当继承下来并且发扬光大。关于生产责任制的建立和巩固就是其中的一个方面。
    有人认为人民公社和农业社不同，只要把组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化搞好，加上批评、表扬、辩论，社员就会积极生产，不需要建立什么责任制了。也有人认为公社应培养社员树立无定额、不计报酬的劳动态度，如果还搞生产责任制，按劳分配，那就是开倒车。这种看法是不全面的。
    今天的人民公社比起农业社来诚然有很大的不同。但是，唯其因为公社的规模更大了，人数更多了，工农商学兵行行俱全，农林牧副渔全面发展，才更加需要高度的组织和计划，更加需要建立科学的生产责任制。组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，并不能代替生产责任制。只有在社员自觉基础上建立了科学的生产责任制，才能使人民公社的劳动组织和劳动管理井井有条，更加发挥又“大”又“公”的集体的威力，更加提高劳动生产率。
    当然，我们的生产责任制是建立在群众的高度觉悟的基础上的。人人自觉地负社会主义之责，负分工生产之责，就是我们现在推行的责任制的本质。这一点，也正是和旧社会的一切“秩序”和“负责”根本不同的地方。
    公社社员热爱自己的人民公社，热爱社会主义，热爱祖国，他们有高度的主人翁的责任感。这就使得各种责任制度能够建立并不断地巩固和提高起来。因此，各地人民公社在建立生产责任制的时候，必须放手发动群众，充分走群众路线。同时，还要不断地加强社员的政治思想教育，使群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟，成为实行各种责任制的最有生命力的动力。
