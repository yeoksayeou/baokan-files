Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd, Havana News: Humberto Sori Marin, the Cuban interim government's Minister of Agriculture and military judge, announced on the 21st that the Havana Military Tribunal would begin trying criminals of the former Batista dictatorial government starting on the 22nd.

He said that the first to be tried would be some of the most heinous Batista elements, most of whom had committed crimes in the Sierra Maestra mountains of Oriente Province, the earlier base of the Cuban rebel army. It is reported that one former government army officer named Jesús Sosa Blanco confessed to slaughtering more than a hundred Cuban patriotic fighters. "What does Sosa bring? -- Brutality and massacre." This is a saying about this murderer that circulates among the peasants of Oriente Province.

Sources say that six hundred peasants from the mountainous areas of Oriente Province have traveled a long distance to Havana, bringing with them many outrageous stories. These peasants will testify during the trials of the criminals.

The Cuban interim government's resolute action to punish Batista criminals has been widely supported by the people of the whole country. David Salvador, a leader of Cuban labor organizations, called on workers on the 21st to "support the legal measures taken by the revolution and the punishment of murderers and all criminals, to oppose foreign interference, safeguard Cuba's national sovereignty, and to support the extradition of war criminals."

Raúl Castro, leader of the armed forces of Oriente Province, Cuba, recently emphasized in Havana that the trial of Batista criminals is not for revenge, but for justice. He once again refuted the clamor from the United States against Cuba's execution of criminals. He said, "We have never lynched a black man, nor have we ever dropped an atomic bomb on an undefended city."

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd, Washington News: While American newspapers and officials are clamoring to prevent the Cuban interim government from punishing criminals, the U.S. government is massively sheltering fugitive officials, large and small, of the Cuban dictatorial regime. According to reports, the U.S. State Department admits that the U.S. government has already sheltered about five hundred former high-ranking officials of the Batista dictatorial regime and Batista relatives.

News says that the U.S. Immigration Bureau recently announced that it has settled the murderer Masferrer, whom the Cuban government requested to be extradited, in McAllen, Texas, in the United States. Masferrer was the head of the "Tiger Squad," notorious for its killings during the Cuban dictatorship. Recently, Batista's wife, who had fled to the Dominican Republic, has gone from the Dominican Republic to New York.

The U.S. government provides various kinds of care for Batista's henchmen who fled to the United States. According to reports, when a large number of criminals fled to the United States by plane or boat, the U.S. Immigration Bureau processed temporary visas for them overnight and dispatched a large number of police officers to protect their safety. U.S. police often prevent these murderers from encountering Cuban patriotic overseas Chinese who are holding demonstrations at the airport. News says that when Batista's wife arrived in New York from the Dominican Republic, the U.S. government also sent many police officers to protect her and prohibited anyone from approaching her.

    反对外国干涉　维护国家主权
    古巴审判巴蒂斯塔罪犯
    美国无耻收容大批逃亡的前古巴独裁政权官员
    新华社22日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府农业部长兼军事审判官翁伯托·索里·马林21日宣布，哈瓦那的军事法庭将从22日起开始审讯前巴蒂斯塔独裁政府的罪犯。
    他说，首先受到审判的将是一些罪大恶极的巴蒂斯塔分子，他们大多数在古巴起义军早先的根据地奥连特省马埃斯特腊山区犯下了罪行。据报道，其中有一个名叫赫苏斯·索萨·布兰科的前政府军官供认他曾残杀了一百多名古巴爱国志士。“索萨一来会带来什么呢？——残暴与屠杀。”这是在奥连特省的农民中流传着的关于这个杀人犯的一句话。
    有消息说，奥连特省山区的六百个农民已经远道赶到哈瓦那，他们带来许多令人发指的消息。这些农民将在审讯罪犯时作证。
    古巴临时政府坚决惩处巴蒂斯塔罪犯的行动得到全国人民的广泛拥护。古巴工人组织的领袖戴维·萨尔瓦多21日号召工人“支持革命采取的法律措施以及对杀人犯和一切罪犯的处罚，反对外国干涉，维护古巴的国家主权和拥护引渡战犯”。
    古巴奥连特省武装部队领导人劳尔·卡斯特罗最近在哈瓦那强调指出，对巴蒂斯塔罪犯的审讯不是为了报复，是为了正义。他再次驳斥从美国来的反对古巴处决罪犯的叫嚣。他说，“我们从未对一个黑人施加私刑，也从未对一个不设防的城市投扔过一枚原子弹。”
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国报纸和官员大肆叫嚣要阻止古巴临时政府惩办罪犯的同时，美国政府正在大批地收容逃亡的古巴独裁政权中的大小官员。据报道，美国国务院承认，美国政府收容的前巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的高级官员和巴蒂斯塔亲属已经有约五百人。
    消息说，美国移民局最近宣布，它已经把古巴政府要求引渡的杀人犯马斯费雷尔安顿在美国得克萨斯州的麦克阿兰。马斯费雷尔是古巴独裁统治时期杀人如麻的号称为“老虎队”的头子。最近，逃亡在多米尼加的巴蒂斯塔的妻子已经从多米尼加去到纽约。
    美国政府给逃跑到美国去的巴蒂斯塔党羽以各种照顾。据报道，当大批罪犯坐飞机或船只逃到美国境界的时候，美国移民局彻夜为他们办理临时签证，并且出动大批警察保护他们的安全。美国警察常常不让这些杀人犯同在机场举行示威抗议的古巴爱国侨民相遇。消息说，当巴蒂斯塔的妻子从多米尼加到达纽约时，美国政府也派了许多警察去保护，并禁止任何人和她接近。
