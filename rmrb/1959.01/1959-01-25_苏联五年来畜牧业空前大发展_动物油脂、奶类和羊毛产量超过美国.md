Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 24th: This reporter reports: In recent years, Soviet animal husbandry, on the basis of the rapid development of grain production, has achieved unprecedented rapid development. Now, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed the United States in the production of some important animal products. The total output of animal fats and milk caught up with and exceeded that of the United States in 1957 and 1958 respectively, ranking first in the world. Wool production is 1.3 times more than that of the United States, second only to Australia and ranking second in the world.

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government vigorously adopted measures to rapidly develop agriculture in 1953, many measures have been taken to overcome the past backwardness in the development of animal husbandry. Reclamation of virgin land and increased grain production have created the most important conditions for the development of animal husbandry. Silage feed has increased from 32 million tons in 1953 to 148 million tons last year. During this period, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to work in the animal husbandry sector, and sent many agricultural experts to strengthen livestock farms. In addition, vigorous steps have also been taken to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of agricultural workers.

All these measures have greatly accelerated the development of Soviet animal husbandry. From 1953 to 1958, the average annual growth rate of meat production in the Soviet Union was 6.2%, while that in the United States was about 1.3%; the growth rate of milk production in the Soviet Union was 9.6%, while that in the United States was 0.9%; the growth rates of wool and eggs in the Soviet Union were 6.4% and 7.9% respectively, while there was no growth in the United States. The rapid development of Soviet livestock products at a rate several times faster than that of the United States is a guarantee for the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita output of livestock products.

In 1950, the output of animal fats and milk in the Soviet Union was only 64% and 66% of that of the United States, respectively, while in 1957 and 1958, it successively caught up with and surpassed the level of the United States. Statistics show that the per capita output of these two products in the Soviet Union is growing rapidly, while the United States has not only not increased, but has also declined. For example, in terms of per capita output, the average milk production per person in the Soviet Union in 1950 was 195 kilograms, and animal fat was 2.6 kilograms; the United States milk production was 351 kilograms, and animal fat was 4.9 kilograms. In 1958, the Soviet Union was very close to the United States in these two aspects. In that year, the milk production in the Soviet Union averaged 279 kilograms per person, and animal fat was 3.7 kilograms, while the United States was 330 kilograms and 4 kilograms respectively.

In the history of the Soviet Union, the development of animal husbandry in the past few years has been unprecedented. In 1958, Soviet meat production (slaughter weight) increased by 35% compared with 1953, milk increased by 58%, wool increased by 37%, and eggs increased by 46%. While livestock products increased substantially, the number of livestock also increased significantly during this period, with cattle increasing by 24%, pigs increasing by 41%, and sheep increasing by 29%. During this period, the number of cattle and sheep in the United States decreased, and the increase in the number of pigs was also much less than that in the Soviet Union.

In order to meet the needs of the Soviet people for livestock products, and to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita output in the shortest possible time, the main task put forward by the Seven-Year Plan in animal husbandry production is to drastically increase the number of various livestock and poultry, and further improve the productivity of animal husbandry. By 1965, the last year of the Seven-Year Plan, meat production (slaughter weight) will be doubled, milk will increase by 70% to 80%, wool will increase by 70%, and eggs will increase by 60%. The implementation of this plan will enable the Soviet Union to greatly exceed the United States in terms of per capita milk and animal fat production, and meat will also further approach the United States.

    苏联五年来畜牧业空前大发展
    动物油脂、奶类和羊毛产量超过美国
    新华社莫斯科24日电　本社记者报道：最近几年来，苏联畜牧业在谷物业迅速发展的基础上，获得了空前迅速的发展。现在，苏联在一些重要畜产品的生产上已经赶上和超过了美国。动物油脂和奶类的总产量分别在1957年和1958年赶上和超过了美国，而居世界第一位。羊毛的产量比美国多一点三倍，仅次于澳大利亚而居世界第二位。
    自1953年苏共中央和苏联政府大力采取措施迅速发展农业以来，在发展畜牧业方面采取了许多措施来克服过去的落后状态。开垦生荒地和增加粮食生产为畜牧业的发展创造了最重要的条件。青贮饲料从1953年的三千二百万吨增加到去年的一亿四千八百万吨。在这期间，苏联共产党派遣了几十万共产党员和共青团员到畜牧业部门去工作，并派了许多农业专家加强养畜场。此外，在发挥农业劳动者的主动性积极性等方面，也采取了有力的步骤。
    所有这些措施大大地加快了苏联畜牧业的发展速度。从1953年到1958年，苏联肉类产量的每年平均增长速度是6.2％，而美国是1.3％左右；奶类增长速度苏联是9.6％，美国是0.9％；羊毛和蛋类苏联分别是6.4％和7.9％，而美国没有增长。苏联畜产品以比美国快几倍的速度向前发展，这就是苏联在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面赶上和超过美国的保证。
    1950年，苏联的动物油脂产量和奶类产量仅分别等于美国的64％和66％，而在1957年和1958年就先后赶上并超过了美国的水平。统计材料说明，苏联这两种产品按人口平均计算的产量在迅速增长，而美国不但没有增加，而且还下降了。例如，在按人口平均计算的产量方面，苏联在1950年奶类产量平均每人为一百九十五公斤，动物油脂为二点六公斤；美国奶类是三百五十一公斤，动物油脂是四点九公斤。1958年，苏联在这两方面已经十分接近美国。这一年，苏联奶类产量平均每人为二百七十九公斤，动物油脂为三点七公斤，而美国分别是三百三十公斤和四公斤。
    在苏联的历史上，过去几年畜牧业的发展是空前未有的。1958年苏联肉类产量（屠宰重量）比1953年增加了35％，奶类增加了58％，羊毛增加了37％，蛋类增加了46％。在畜产品大量增加的同时，牲畜头数在这个时期也有了显著的增长，其中牛增加了24％，猪增加了41％，羊增加了29％。在这个时期，美国的牛和绵羊却减少了，猪的头数的增加也比苏联少得多。
    为满足苏联人民对畜产品的需要，以及在最短的时间内在按人口平均计算产量方面赶上美国，七年计划在畜牧业生产方面提出的主要任务是：急剧增加各种牲畜和家畜的数量，进一步提高畜牧业的产品率。到七年计划的最后一年1965年，肉类产量（屠宰重量）将增加一倍，奶类将增加70％到80％，羊毛将增加70％，蛋类将增加60％。这个计划的实现将使苏联在按人口计算的奶类和动物油脂产量方面大大超过美国，肉类也进一步接近美国。
