    How Nanbu County Uncovered the Secrets of the Soil
    Tang Kezhu

    To carry out mass soil survey and identification work, to uncover the secrets of the soil, to make the land obey human commands, and to achieve planting according to soil type and fertilization according to soil type, is one of the measures to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific spirit in agricultural production. Last year, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, after a mass struggle to conquer the soil, gained the initiative in managing the land, established "archives" for the soil, basically achieved planting according to soil type and fertilization according to soil type, and the average grain yield per mu reached more than 1,500 jin for the whole year, an increase of nearly two times; cotton production increased nearly three times.

    In the past, many cadres and farmers in Nanbu County did not fully grasp the secrets of the land. Some cadres were both fond of and afraid of fertilizer. They said that they would "laugh in the early stage when they see the seedlings, and jump with both feet in the later stage when they see the seedlings" (lodging). The masses of farmers have experience in this area, and many of their experiences still have important value today. However, because the development speed of agricultural production today is unprecedented, and crop yields have increased sharply from hundreds of jin to thousands of jin or even several thousand jin, its growth laws and the conditions it needs have undergone great changes. For this unprecedented new thing, relying solely on old experience and blind hard work cannot solve the problem. In particular, the cultivated soil layer has become thicker, and the amount of fertilizer has increased. How to fertilize reasonably is a problem.

    In order to solve this problem, Nanbu County carried out a comprehensive mass soil survey and identification work from July to October last year. In just one and a half months, the county thoroughly understood the soil conditions, and formulated plans for land use, soil improvement, and rational fertilization, building high yields on a more scientific and reliable foundation.

    In the early stage of the movement, some farmers did not quite understand the significance of soil identification. Various localities adopted various vivid and specific methods such as seizing every opportunity to talk about it, talking while doing it, and other methods to popularize the relationship between soil and fertilizer to the masses in a simple and easy-to-understand way. The masses of farmers have rich production experience. As long as they are explained in simple and easy-to-understand terms and principles, they not only have a deep understanding of many scientific principles, but also can quickly grasp them and carry out research in combination with reality. For example, when Nanlong Commune began its survey, the masses were not very willing to participate, and many difficulties were encountered in the work. The technicians were divided into four groups to carry out extensive publicity. There was a large bend in the field in this commune, and the seedlings would lodge every year without fertilization, and the yield was very low, and the root cause could not be found. After taking soil samples for testing, it was proved that this field was acidic soil, with too much nitrogen fertilizer and too little phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, forming vigorous growth of branches and leaves, and lodging every year. After explaining the principles clearly to the masses, they helped to formulate improvement methods, and the farmers were convinced. In addition, the seedlings of more than ten mu of rice turned red, and it was determined that the soil acidity was too high. After applying lime, the seedlings quickly turned green, and the farmers were very satisfied and said: "This method is really good, red seedlings can also be cured green." These vivid facts effectively convinced the masses. Many farmers actively participated in this work and helped to provide various information. In just two days, the survey of more than 10,000 mu of land in the whole commune was completed.

    In this struggle to march towards nature and conquer the soil, the broad masses of farmers studied tenaciously, worked hard, overcame the many difficulties of low education level and lack of scientific knowledge, quickly mastered relatively complex chemical analysis methods and soil fertilizer knowledge, and used facts to break the fallacy of "scientific mystery." Pang Yuyun, a 49-year-old who was illiterate, mastered all the technical knowledge after a few days of hard study; Pu Guoliang, who only had a junior primary school education, compiled the soil identification method, which was thousands of words long, into a jingle of less than two hundred words, making it easy for farmers to remember; Wang Wanmu, a young farmer with only a senior primary school education, was able to write clear soil survey reports after a short period of internship. Now, this technical team has been transformed into the most active force engaged in scientific research in rural areas.

    During the movement, the masses of farmers gave full play to their communist style of daring to think and daring to act, and created many tools using indigenous methods, solving the difficulty of insufficient supply of laboratory equipment in the work. When the movement entered its climax, there was a great shortage of distilled water for testing. All the distillers in hospitals and colleges in the county were concentrated, but they were still not enough, and it was not easy to buy them. The young farmer Zheng Yougui thought of the equipment used for brewing wine. He thought, isn't the wine we drink brewed like distilled water? He made an indigenous distiller out of wooden barrels and earthenware jars, which could produce 120 jin of distilled water every day, and the quality also met the standards. When drawing topographic maps, the county needed thousands of compasses, which were difficult to buy at once. The young farmer Chen Xingyun came up with a clever plan. He saw through the principle that the compass can determine the orientation, which is nothing more than the relationship of magnetic force. He used the magnet behind the broadcasting loudspeaker to magnetize ordinary needles, and he could make several compasses in one minute. For tin powder used to measure the phosphorus content of the soil, they also made ordinary tin into tin rods, which were economical and easy to use, replacing imported goods. These creations effectively ensured the smooth progress of the movement.

    After the mass soil survey and identification, people broke the mystery of science, and a wave of marching towards science and technology was set off throughout the county. Various scientific research organizations sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, and 59 soil fertilizer research offices were established in the county. Many commune members showed great interest in soil survey and identification. They have never been so eager to learn science and technology as they are today.

    The soil survey and identification movement has brought a new atmosphere to Nanbu County. Walking into the offices of the people's communes, you can see the distribution of the land in the whole commune at a glance from the charts without going out, know what kind of soil it is, how to cultivate it, how to fertilize it, and how to improve it. The wooden signs inserted in each field also clearly mark: what crops are suitable for this field; how to cultivate deeply and densely plant, what fertilizer to apply, how much to apply, and so on. In winter production, the county's small spring crops have generally achieved planting according to soil type and fertilization according to soil type. The wheat seedlings are growing green and lovely, and the scene is thriving everywhere. At present, on the basis of the survey and identification, the people of the county have launched a new upsurge of accumulating fertilizer and improving soil, and regularly conduct tests according to the growth of crops and the changes in soil fertility, record them one by one in the soil "archives," and prepare to summarize them at the time of harvest to find a scientific law for obtaining high yields.

    南部县是怎样揭开土壤秘密的
    唐克柱
    开展群众性的土壤普查鉴定工作，揭开土壤的秘密，叫土地听人使唤，做到因地种植按土施肥，是在农业生产上贯彻革命热情与科学精神相结合的措施之一。四川省南部县在去年经过一场群众性的征服土壤的斗争，取得了支配土地的主动权，给土壤建立了“档案”，基本实现了按土种植，按土施肥，全年粮食平均亩产已达一千五百多斤，增产将近两倍；棉花增产近三倍。
    过去，南部县有不少干部和农民，对土地的秘密没有完全掌握。有的干部对肥料又爱又怕，他们说自己是“前期见苗哈哈笑，后期见苗双脚跳（倒伏）”。农民群众在这方面是有经验的，有许多经验在今天仍然有重要的价值。但是，由于今天农业生产的发展速度是空前的，作物产量由几百斤猛增至千斤、几千斤，它的生长规律和所需要的条件已经发生了很大的变化。对于这种史无前例的新事物，仅凭旧有的经验和盲目的瞎干是不能解决问题的。特别是耕地土层变厚了，肥料增多了，怎样施肥才是合理就是一个问题了。
    为了解决这个问题，南部县在去年7月至10月开展了全面的群众性的土壤普查鉴定工作。仅仅在一个半月的时间内，就摸清了全县的土壤底细，分别制订出土地利用、改良土壤和合理施肥的规划，把高产建立在更科学可靠的基础上。
    运动初期，有些农民一时还不大了解土壤鉴定意义，各地便采取了见缝插针，见会就讲，边讲边做等各种生动具体的办法，向群众通俗地宣传土壤和肥料的关系。农民群众是有丰富的生产经验的，只要用通俗易懂的名词和道理去讲解，他们对许多科学道理不但有深刻的体会，并且能很快地掌握，结合实际去开展研究。如南隆公社开始进行普查时，群众不大愿意参加，工作中碰到很多困难。技术员们便分成四个组广泛进行宣传。这个社有个大弯田，年年不施肥苗子也要倒伏，产量很低，始终找不着病根。经过取土化验，证明这块田是酸性土，氮肥多，磷钾肥少，形成猛长枝叶，年年倒伏。向群众讲清道理后，帮助订出了改良办法，农民也就服气了。另外有十多亩稻子的秧苗发红，经测定是土壤酸度过大。施用了石灰，秧苗很快就转青了，农民很满意地说：“这个办法真好，红秧也能治青。”这些生动的事实，有力地说服了群众。很多农民积极参加了这项工作，帮助提供各种资料。仅仅两天时间，就完成了全社一万多亩土地的调查工作。
    在这场向大自然进军、征服土壤的斗争中，广大农民顽强学习，刻苦钻研，克服了文化低，不懂科学的重重困难，迅速地掌握了比较复杂的化学分析方法和土壤肥料知识，用事实破除了“科学神秘”的论调。一字不识的四十九岁的庞雨云，经过几天苦学苦钻，掌握了全部技术知识；只有初小文化程度的蒲国良，把长达几千字的土壤鉴定法编写成不到两百字的口诀，便于农民记忆；只有高小文化水平的青年农民王万木，经过短期实习，能写出内容清楚的土壤调查报告。现在，这批技术队伍已改成农村中从事科学研究最活跃的力量。
    在运动中，农民群众发挥了敢想敢作的共产主义风格，用土办法创造了许多工具，解决了工作中化验器材供应不足的困难。当运动进入高潮的时候，供化验用的蒸馏水很缺乏，全县集中了医院、学院所有蒸馏器仍不够用，买也不容易买到。青年农民郑友贵想起了烤酒用的那套器具，他想，我们吃的酒不是像蒸馏水一样烤的吗？他用木桶、瓦缸做成了土蒸馏器，每天可烤出一百二十斤蒸馏水，质量也符合标准。在绘制地形图时，全县需要几千个指南针，一时很难买到。青年农民陈兴云又献出了妙计。他看透了指南针能定方位的原理，只不过是磁力的关系。他便利用广播喇叭后面的磁铁，磁化普通用针，一分钟就能做出几个指南针。测土壤含磷量用的锡粉，他们也用普通的锡做成锡棒，又经济又好用，代替了进口货。这些创造，有力地保证了运动的顺利进行。
    经过群众性的土壤普查鉴定以后，人们破除了对科学的神秘感，全县掀起了一个向科学技术大进军的热潮。各种科学研究的组织，如雨后春笋般地接二连三地建立起来，全县成立了五十九个土壤肥料研究室。许多社员对土壤普查鉴定表现了很大的兴趣，他们从来没有像今天这样迫切要求学科学技术。
    土壤普查鉴定运动，给南部县带来了崭新的气象。走到各个人民公社的办公室里，不出门就能从图表上一眼看出全社土地的分布状况，知道有些什么性质的土壤，怎样耕作，怎样施肥，怎样改良。插在每块田里的木牌也明显地标出了：这块田适宜种什么作物；怎样深耕、密植，施用什么肥料，施用多少等等。冬季生产中，全县小春作物已普遍作到了按土种植，按土施肥。麦苗长得油绿可爱，到处一片欣欣向荣的景象。目前，全县人民已在普查鉴定的基础上，掀起了积造肥料、改良土壤的新高潮，并根据作物生长情况和土壤肥力的变化，经常进行测定，逐一记录在土壤
  “档案”内，准备收割时进行总结，找出一条获得高产的科学规律来。
