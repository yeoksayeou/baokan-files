Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Beijing, January 7th. Beijing's factories and mines actively arranged for the first quarter of 1959's production before the end of last year, creating favorable conditions for a bigger leap forward this year, and fighting a beautiful first battle.
    When making production arrangements, all factories and mines mobilized the masses to fully air their views and launch a technical revolution movement, targeting the key issues of production leaps. In a short period of time, many factories have formed a mass upsurge in production preparation. The broad masses of workers, based on the key issues of their own units, put forward a large number of methods and suggestions, and immediately took action to realize these suggestions. The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, which completed its annual Great Leap Forward plan for 1958 a month ahead of schedule, put forward 307 technical improvement measures before the end of the year, based on the factory Party committee's plan for a bigger leap forward in 1959, targeting weaknesses such as insufficient raw materials, equipment, tools, production area, and labor force. These measures included making 104 simple lathes, drum machines, and wire drawing machines, and modifying 53 pieces of equipment. The workers in the No. 2 workshop of this factory have already solved technical problems such as assembling tube cores and modifying aging platforms in the production of assembling electronic tubes, laying the foundation for doubling the workshop's output in 1959. The workers of Guanghua Lumber Factory also enthusiastically discussed the production plan for the first quarter of 1959 in three days before the New Year, and proposed that the key to completing the plan lies in fully utilizing wood comprehensively, completely eliminating waste, and further exploiting the potential of equipment. Based on this situation, the factory decided to rely on its own efforts to build factory buildings, manufacture machinery and equipment, and establish four sections for producing shavings, activated carbon, bakelite, and alcohol. More than 200 workers have been transferred from various workshops before the New Year to start building factory buildings, and the manufacture of machinery and equipment has also started simultaneously, preparing conditions for experimental production in early January. After these four sections are put into production, the factory's waste materials such as shavings, sawdust, and firewood can be used to make shavings, activated carbon, bakelite powder, etc. with high output value, so that the wood utilization rate can reach more than 97%.
    In the process of production preparation, many factories mobilized the masses to summarize their factories' Great Leap Forward achievements in 1958, so that the workers were full of confidence in overcoming new difficulties in the 1959 production leap. When discussing the plan for the first quarter of 1959, the workers of the Beijing Switch Factory anticipated that raw materials would be relatively difficult, and some people expressed a lack of confidence. By summarizing the three things they did in 1958, which included modifying designs to save raw materials, starting steelmaking from scratch, and working hard for three days to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of 80% of the manual operations of the whole factory, every worker clearly saw his own strength and his confidence in overcoming difficulties was greatly enhanced. At the "Skills Competition Meeting," the workers put forward 104 suggestions for self-reliance in solving the difficulties of raw materials and insufficient equipment. The workshops and offices then formed special groups to study ways to realize these suggestions. The machine repair class of the Fifth Workshop completed the task of self-making saw blades, which was originally scheduled for fifteen days, in one day and one night of hard work. The trial production of parts using cast steel instead of shaped steel was also successfully carried out in the Sixth Workshop. At present, the whole factory presents a tense combat atmosphere, and the workers are determined to break through difficulties and ensure that the 1959 production will leap again.

    北京各厂矿生产准备动手早
    广大职工跃进劲头足措施好
    据新华社讯　北京各厂矿在去年年底以前，就积极为1959年第一季度的生产安排，为今年更大跃进打好漂亮的第一仗创造了有利条件。
    各厂矿在进行生产安排时，都发动群众大鸣大放，针对生产跃进的关键问题，开展技术革命运动。在很短的时间内，很多工厂都形成了群众性的进行生产准备的热潮，广大职工根据本单位的关键问题，提出了大量的办法和建议，并且立即行动起来实现这些建议。提前一个月完成1958年全年跃进计划的北京电子管厂的职工，根据工厂党委提出的1959年更大跃进的计划，针对原材料、设备、工具、生产面积、劳动力不足等薄弱环节，在年底以前已实现技术改进措施三百零七项，其中制成简易车床、滚筒机、拉丝机等一百零四台，改装设备五十三项。这个厂二号车间的工人们，在装配电子管的生产上，已经解决了装管芯、改装老炼台等技术问题，为1959年车间产量翻番打下了基础。光华木材厂的职工也在年前用三天的时间，热烈讨论了1959年第一季度生产计划，并提出完成计划的关键在于充分综合利用木材、彻底消灭废料，进一步发挥设备潜力等。根据这一情况，工厂决定自力更生，自己建厂房，自己制造机器设备，建立生产刨花板、活性炭、电木、酒精等四个工段。还在过年以前就已经从各个车间抽调出了二百多名工人开始修建厂房，机械设备的制造也同时着手进行，为1月初进行试验性生产准备了条件。这四个工段投入生产以后，工厂的刨花、锯末、劈柴等废料就可以用来制成产值很高的刨花板、活性炭、电木粉等，使木材利用率达到97％以上。
    在进行生产准备工作中，不少工厂发动群众总结本厂1958年生产跃进事迹，使职工们对克服1959年生产跃进中新的困难充满了信心。北京开关厂的职工在讨论1959年第一季度计划的时候，预计到原材料比较困难，一部分人曾表示信心不足。通过总结1958年修改设计节省原材料、白手起家搞炼钢和苦战三天使全厂80％的手工操作实现了机械化半机械化三件事，每个职工都清楚地看到自己的力量，克服困难的信心大为增强。在“比武大会”上，职工们提出了一百零四项自力更生解决原材料困难和设备不足的建议。各车间、科室随即组成专门小组，研究实现这些建议的办法。五车间机修班把原订十五天自制锯条的任务，苦战一昼夜就完成了，以铸钢代替型钢制造部件，也在六车间试制成功。目前全厂呈现一片紧张的战斗气氛，职工们决心突破困难，保证1959年生产跃进再跃进。
