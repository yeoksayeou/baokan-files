Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, January 13th: The Party Committee of the Liuzhou Power Plant in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has strengthened its leadership over the employees' spare-time education, effectively solving the three key problems of class time, teachers, and teaching materials, enabling the employees' spare-time study to persevere for three years.

The Liuzhou Power Plant's employees' spare-time cultural school was established in the second half of 1955 after the entire plant eliminated illiteracy. Currently, there are six classes from elementary to high school. Except for a few leading cadres, all of the more than two hundred employees in the plant are enrolled.

The plant's Party Committee believes that continuously improving the scientific and cultural level of the employees is an important part of running the factory well and improving production. Therefore, the Party Committee has always attached importance to the employees' spare-time education and strengthened leadership in many ways. The first is to properly arrange study time to resolve the contradiction between production and study. The employees' spare-time study time in this plant totals twelve and a half hours per week. Although the time occupied is not small, the factory's Party Committee has arranged it well so that study and production can be carried out interchangeably. This is the primary guarantee that the plant can persist in learning for a long time. According to the plant's arrangement, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are class times for the cultural school, and Tuesdays and Thursdays are times for Party lessons, Communist Youth League lessons, and philosophy group activities; each day is two and a half hours of study. Party lessons are held twice a month, Communist Youth League lessons at least once a month, and philosophy group studies are also held twice a month. These three types of study activities take turns occupying the study time on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so they do not repeat. What is more important is that, according to the plant's three-shift work system, the employees' spare-time study is also divided into three shifts. Employees who work in the morning attend classes in the evening, those who work in the afternoon attend classes in the morning, and those who work in the evening attend classes in the afternoon. This not only ensures that the students' learning progress is consistent, but also allows students time to rest after work. Once the study time of the plant's cultural school is fixed, it is not easily occupied or suspended. If there is a major political movement that requires suspension of classes, the Party Committee will also notify the teachers in advance to prepare early.

In order to ensure teaching quality, the Party Committee has equipped the spare-time cultural school with sufficient teachers. There are currently seven teachers, all of whom are politically reliable and competent in teaching. These teachers are generally not casually transferred to do other work, so that they have a certain amount of time to study the Party's educational guidelines and policies, and to learn professional skills; they also need to go to the workshops to understand what knowledge the students need in the production process, and then add or delete teaching materials according to the students' needs, and prepare lessons thoroughly.

The Party Committee of the Liuzhou Power Plant believes that simplifying teaching materials according to the needs of production and allowing employees to concentrate on learning courses closely related to production is an important part of doing a good job in employees' spare-time teaching. Therefore, the Party Committee takes time to study the addition and deletion of teaching materials with the teachers and determines the focus of explanation. For example, in physics class, the electrical part is the focus of explanation, so it is explained in more detail, and technicians are invited to do practical teaching.

Because the relationship between study and production is handled well in the Liuzhou Power Plant, and the teaching content is suitable for the needs of the workers, the employees' spare-time education has not only been maintained for three years, but also the employees' academic performance is good, generally above 80 points. For example, when technician Shi Changlin repaired a generator, it was initially very difficult because there was no crane. Later, he built a wooden frame and applied the principles of inclined planes and levers to finally install the boiler, successfully completing the task. Now, the employees of this plant have a great interest in studying politics and delving into science and technology. Most of the books displayed in the library are related to these areas. The "Dare to Think and Dare to Do" magazine published by the Liuzhou Municipal Party Committee Office is almost in everyone's hands. Because of the improved cultural level, the workers write, sing, and perform their own cultural and entertainment activities, which are extremely active.

### 妥善安排时间　配备足够师资　选择适当教材  柳州电厂职工学习三年如一日

    妥善安排时间　配备足够师资　选择适当教材
    柳州电厂职工学习三年如一日
    新华社南宁13日电　广西僮族自治区柳州电厂党委加强对职工业余教育的领导，切实解决了上课时间、师资和教材三个关键问题，使职工业余学习三年来坚持不懈。
    柳州电厂职工业余文化学校，是在1955年下半年全厂扫除文盲以后开办的，目前从小学到高中共有六个班级。全厂除了几个领导干部以外，二百多职工全部入学。
    这个厂的党委会认为，不断提高职工们的科学文化水平，是办好工厂、提高生产的重要一环。因此党委一贯重视职工业余教育，多方面地加强领导。首先是恰当地安排学习时间，解决生产与学习的矛盾。这个厂职工业余学习时间每星期共占十二个半小时。占用时间虽然不少，但由于工厂党委安排得好，使学习和生产能够交叉地进行。这是这个厂能够长期坚持学习的首要保证。根据厂里的安排，每星期一、三、五是文化学校上课时间，每星期二、四是上党课、团课和哲学小组活动时间；每天都是学习两个半小时。党课每个月两次，团课至少一次，哲学小组学习每个月也是两次。这三种学习活动轮流占用星期二、四的学习时间，不致重复。比较重要的是他们根据厂里的三班劳动制，把职工业余学习也分做三班进行。上午上班的职工在晚上上课，下午上班的在上午上课，晚上上班的下午上课。这样，一方面保证了学员学习进度一致，另方面也使学员在劳动后，有时间休息。这个厂文化学校的学习时间一经固定，轻易不去占用或停课。如有重大政治运动需要停课进行，党委也提早通知教师，好早作准备。
    为了保证教学质量，党委给业余文化学校配备了足够的师资。现有教师七人，他们都是政治可靠而又能胜任教学工作的。这些教师一般不随便抽调去搞其他工作，使他们有一定的时间学习党的教育方针和政策，学习业务；也要下车间去了解学员在生产过程中需要些什么知识，然后根据学员的需要，增删教材，充分备课。
    柳州电厂党委认为：根据生产的需要精简教材，让职工集中精力学好同生产有密切关系的课程，是搞好职工业余教学的重要环节。因此，党委抽空与教师研究教材的增删，确定讲解重点。如物理课，电的部分是讲解重点，就讲得详细些，并且请技术员来作实物教学。
    柳州电厂由于学习和生产的关系处理得较好，教学内容适合于工人的需要，所以三年来职工业余教育不但一直坚持下来，而且职工的学习成绩较好，一般都在八十分以上。像技工石昌林修复一个发电机时，起初因为没有起重机，工作很困难。后来他搭起了一个木架，应用斜面和杠杆原理，终于把锅炉安装上去，胜利完成了任务。现在这个厂的职工们学习政治和钻研科学技术的兴趣很大，陈列在图书室里的书籍，大多是有关这些方面的书籍。中共柳州市委办的“敢想敢做”杂志，几乎人手一本。由于文化水平提高了，工人自编自唱自演，文化娱乐生活也极为活跃。
