On the Development of Poetry
Bian Zhilin

In his article "The Road of New Poetry" (see page 7 of the "People's Daily" on December 31, 1958), Comrade Sha Ou spent half of the entire article's fourth section analyzing five kinds of erroneous statements regarding the "formal issues" of poetry "in the past year," and designated me (and Comrade He Qifang) as representatives of three of them. Being responsible for three out of five is a considerable responsibility, so I'm coming out to speak. I want to talk about whether my statements are like this, what they actually are, whether my statements have shortcomings, and what my current views are. In this way, I think it will help to clear the way for discussion when discussing the road of poetry, and also provide some reference for the discussion itself.

I.

First, the process of how I expressed my views and aroused controversy must be explained.

In recent years, due to my work position, I have rarely written or talked about poetry, rarely paid attention to poetry issues, and even less participated in debates. In May and June of last year, "Virgin Land" repeatedly invited and urged me to write my own opinions on the "development of new poetry" (the original title given by "Virgin Land"). I took some time to quickly write a brief outline of more than a thousand words, titled "Several Views on the Development of New Poetry" (hereinafter referred to as "Several Views"), which was published in the July 1958 issue of "Virgin Land." The first four points in the article related to the current discussion, in order, were roughly as follows: 1. Our society "is in the midst of a great leap forward today, with blooming flowers everywhere, and poetry everywhere." Judging from precedents in the literary history of various countries, "great literary achievements" can only "develop" from similar situations, and our current situation is "a situation of leaping into a socialist society, so we can affirm that our unprecedented 'new' literature will gush out from the songs of 600 million people." 2. We "should first learn from new folk songs," but we should not just mechanically imitate the most superficial forms of new folk songs, just writing five- or seven-character sentences. Instead, we should first be educated by new folk songs in the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and secondly, mainly learn the "style," "expression methods," "language" of new folk songs, "in order to use them as a foundation," combining the excellent traditions of old poetry and new poetry, and even absorbing the "absorbable strengths" of foreign poetry, "to create newer and more colorful poems." 3. The folk song form, mainly in five- or seven-character rhyming verses, should not be the only form of new poetry, and the new poetry forms since the "May Fourth" Movement "should not be rejected." 4. "The vernacular new poetry since the 'May Fourth' Movement" has "a prominent shortcoming," which "is that very few lines can be remembered by everyone." "One reason is that a new prosody that is generally recognized has not yet been formed," unlike the folk song form, which generally has a traditional prosody. Another reason, "more importantly," "is that it is not concise enough," while "old Chinese poetry seems particularly concise."

I don't know how this aroused dissatisfaction from enthusiasts like Comrade Song Lei. Comrade Song Lei published an article titled "Discussing with Comrades He Qifang and Bian Zhilin" (hereinafter referred to as "Discussion") in the October 1958 issue of "Poetry," seizing upon phrases and pursuing "implications," giving me (and Comrade He Qifang) the conclusion of "despising new folk songs." "Poetry" asked me to reply, so I wrote another brief outline, "Where is the Divergence?" ("Poetry," November 1958), which only "made a few clarifications and raised a few questions," without expressing new views. Comrade Song Lei again published an article in "Poetry" (December 1958), insisting that I "despise new folk songs": "The Divergence is Here." The three erroneous statements of mine now raised by Comrade Sha Ou, his citations, and his criticisms, do not go beyond the scope mentioned, cited, and criticized by Comrade Song Lei in those two articles.

I will also talk about it in three points.

1. Comrade Sha Ou said: "One view is that new folk songs only win by content, and the form is old stuff, not worth mentioning." This view may exist, but he believes that I (and Comrade He Qifang) are making this statement. I have to ask: what is the basis? Is the basis tenable?

First of all, I have not said such a thing in the article "Several Views," nor have I expressed such a meaning. Only, after reading Comrade Song Lei's "Discussion," seeing that he summarized the main ideas of my "Several Views" (and Comrade He Qifang's article), mostly violating the original meaning, in the article "Where is the Divergence?" I only said one sentence about the point that Comrade He Qifang and I believed that "new folk songs mainly win by content": "roughly correct." This seems to have given Comrade Song Lei a handle. In his article "The Divergence is Here," he boldly inferred: you admit that "new folk songs mainly win by content," you despise the form of new folk songs, you despise new folk songs. In fact, his inference itself is problematic. Everyone knows that the content and form of a work should be unified, but we do not therefore cannot talk about the content or form of a work. According to Comrade Song Lei's statement, does the saying "content determines form" also contain the meaning of despising form, despising the meaning of the work? Comrade Lu Xuebin said in his article "Further Develop the New Folk Song Movement" (see page 7 of the "People's Daily" on December 10, 1958): "These new folk songs inherit the tradition of past folk songs, maintain and promote the excellent characteristics of past folk songs, but in content, they are fundamentally different from past folk songs." Does this not also indicate that the characteristics of new folk songs are primarily in content? In this way, does he also despise new folk songs? And my article "Several Views" is not purely (or even mainly) talking about the form of new folk songs, how can I not emphasize the content of new folk songs? Now Comrade Sha Ou has taken a step higher on the basis of Comrade Song Lei's reasoning, changing "mainly" to "only," changing to say that "new folk songs only win by content," and therefore inferring that this essentially "despises the folk poetry form," the reasoning is relatively complete, but assigning this view to me is definitely not "roughly correct," but completely "wrong."

Secondly, Comrade Sha Ou cited a sentence from my article "Several Views" – "But for us to learn from folk songs, it is not to learn to 'write' folk songs by imitating them, because that can only be forgery, destined to fail" – as an example of my despising the form of folk songs. But he did not pay attention to the paragraph below – "When we learn from new folk songs, in addition to being educated by it in the feelings of the working people (it should be said "thoughts and feelings," probably I missed writing the word "thoughts" in a hurry at the time – Bian), we mainly learn its style, its expression methods, its language, in order to use them as a foundation, combining the excellent traditions of old poetry, the excellent traditions of new poetry since the 'May Fourth' Movement, and even the absorbable strengths of foreign poetry, to create newer and more colorful poems." And this sentence is precisely the main "basis" for Comrade Song Lei to infer that I believe that "new folk songs mainly win by content." I have already mentioned it in the article "Where is the Divergence?" Now I might as well ask again: don't "style," "expression methods," and "language," especially "expression methods," "in the field of literary criticism" belong to the "form" aspect? Comrade Sha Ou himself also said: "We know that the concept of the form of poetry contains much broader content, that the image determined by the content, as well as the genre, format, structure, technique, rhyme, etc., should all belong to the concept of form. And these are realized by using language. Therefore, if we only regard form as a matter of how many characters there are, it would be too simple." So, how could I, by saying that, be saying that the form of new folk songs is "not worth mentioning"?

Third, what I said at the time was somewhat aimed at the tendency of intellectuals learning from new folk songs to mechanically imitate the narrow form of five-character sentences or seven-character sentences, four lines per poem. Therefore, I advocated that first there should be the true feelings of the working people expressed by the new folk songs, and secondly, the form of the new folk songs (the broad form) should be taken "as a foundation," absorbing traditional and even foreign strengths, and creatively developing our new poetry. This certainly cannot be done in a day or two, but we should have such a longer-term and higher goal of struggle.

2. Comrade Sha Ou said: "One view is that there is nothing to learn from the form of new folk songs, and a 'new prosody poetry' or 'modern prosody poetry' should be established that includes all the advantages of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign." He pointed out that I (and Comrade He Qifang) are making this statement. What is the truth? Regarding the part "there is nothing to learn from the form of new folk songs," I have already explained above that my statement is not like this, quite the opposite. Here, I only need to add one sentence: in the article "Where is the Divergence?" I did mention that the narrow form of new folk songs ("the poetry 'form' mainly based on five-character 'form' and seven-character 'form'") is not a new form, but saying "old" does not necessarily mean "not worth mentioning." Here, I will only talk about the prosody issue.

First of all, in the article "Several Views," I only mentioned it when talking about the shortcomings of vernacular new poetry since the "May Fourth" Movement, mentioning the reason why it is not easy to remember, and then said this sentence: "One reason is that a new prosody that is generally recognized has not yet been formed (rhyming is part of prosody; the folk song form generally has a traditional prosody)." Because Comrade Song Lei said in the article "Discussion" that I (and Comrade He Qifang) were designing a set of "new prosody" out of thin air, I explained in the article "Where is the Divergence?" that I have rarely talked about the prosody of poetry since liberation, saying "In the past, I considered the issue of new poetry prosody based on the practice of poetry creation since the 'May Fourth' Movement, based on the characteristics of modern spoken language, referring to the rules of classical poetry and Western poetry, and conducted exploration under the guidance of the basic principles of Chinese and foreign poetry metrics. I also did not 'abandon' the folk song form." Comrade Song Lei did not believe the latter part of my sentence, so he inferred: "Here, folk songs can neither be used as a basis nor as a reference." Now Comrade Sha Ou also only cites my previous sentence, and further points out that I am thus "disregarding the fact that the working masses are creating millions of new folk songs." May I ask: before there was a great leap forward of new folk songs, how could I have foreseen this fact?

Secondly, I said "the practice of poetry creation since the 'May Fourth' Movement," how can it be concluded that I do not include the practice of wartime songs, the practice of using folk song forms in new poetry, and the practice of creation derived from folk songs such as "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang"? When I say "classical poetry," how does it mean that I do not include ancient folk songs such as the "Book of Songs" and the "Airs of the States"? When I say "Western poetry," how does it mean that I do not include folk song genres such as the English Robin Hood ballads? "Folk songs can neither be used as a basis nor as a reference," even in the past, was not my idea.

Third, the issue of poetry prosody is also a department of literary theory. We say that poetry should be generally neat, and poetry should rhyme. This includes the issue of prosody. The four "basic features" of "today's poetry form" that Comrade Sha Ou himself concluded almost all include the issue of prosody. If someone talks about prosody or new prosody now, it does not mean denying new folk songs. In "Several Views," as a shortcoming, I mentioned that new poetry has "not formed a new prosody that is generally recognized"; as an advantage, I mentioned that "the folk song form generally has a traditional prosody." I did not want to "design" a new prosody and exclude the traditional prosody used by new folk songs. I said in "Where is the Divergence?" that the vast majority of new folk songs are metrical poems. Exploring the issue of poetry prosody, including the prosody of new folk songs, will not be without benefits for the development of new poetry.

3. Comrade Sha Ou said: "One view is that the folk song form has limitations. This opinion has two sources, one source is to use the saying 'has limitations' to deny new folk songs or despise new folk songs, which is obviously incorrect." He believes that my (and Comrade He Qifang's) "argument has this tendency." I have to talk about what the truth is.

I did not say the folk song form "has limitations" in the article "Several Views," but indeed the meaning of "has limitations" is contained in my statement. This meaning is contained in my proposition that "the national form of poetry should not be understood as just the form of folk songs"; this meaning is also contained in a proposition where I advocated learning the style, expression methods, and language of new folk songs "as a foundation," absorbing the strengths of old poetry, new poetry, and even foreign poetry, "to create newer and more colorful poems." The "source" is like this, and conversely, the purpose of my affirming that the folk song form "has limitations" is clearly to explain: (1) the folk song form should not be the only form, (2) new folk songs need to be developed. How can I, by putting forward these two arguments under the premise of taking the form (broad form) of new folk songs "as a foundation" to create new poetry, be "denying new folk songs or despising new folk songs"? How is it not close to or contrary to the other intention that Comrade Sha Ou considers "correct and also beneficial"?

II.

Then, why is my "Several Views" so easily misunderstood? Has my view on the issue of poetry development developed in any way today? I will now talk about these two aspects.

I am not responsible for the objective reasons for the misunderstanding, so I don't need to talk about it. There are also subjective reasons for the misunderstanding for which I am responsible, that is: my own views do indeed have some shortcomings.

1. The two arguments contained in my statement, "new folk songs need to be developed" and "the folk song form should not be the only form," were put forward a little too early. When the new folk song movement had just unfolded, I expressed expectations for "newer and more colorful" new poetry (and even "unprecedented 'new' literature") to develop from the new folk songs, which cannot be said to be too early; advocating first experiencing the thoughts and feelings expressed by new folk songs, mainly taking the form (broad form) of new folk songs "as a foundation," and developing it, cannot be said to be too early for poets writing new poetry. At the same time, there was indeed a tendency at that time to advocate unifying the form of poetry with the five- and seven-character form of folk songs, so putting forward the meaning of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" cannot be said to be too early, right? However, in terms of the overall situation at the time, the new folk song movement and the movement to learn from new folk songs were still beginning, so putting forward the "development" issue, and raising the issue of not using one "form" to unify the form, if it attracted excessive attention from everyone, then the negative effect on the movement would be greater than the positive effect. So I now admit: it was a bit too early.

2. My mentioning the issue of prosody was also a bit untimely. When the creation of new folk songs was flourishing and excellent lines of new folk songs were being spread everywhere, in addition to noticing that the content of new folk songs had an important educational effect on everyone, and that the form (broad form) of new folk songs could be used as the basis for the development of new poetry, comparing the fact that the folk song form "generally has a traditional prosody," when poets reconsidered the shortcomings of new poetry, saying that new poetry has not "formed a new prosody that is generally recognized," cannot be considered untimely. If someone therefore considers and talks about the strengths and weaknesses of the prosody embodied in folk songs, it would also be beneficial for the masses (and poets) to better utilize the old prosody or boldly break through the old prosody. However, when the masses creating new folk songs have unintentionally already shown attempts to break through the old prosody to some extent, my raising the issue of prosody, saying that prosody is important, will also have a negative effect on this attempt. So I say: it was also a bit untimely.

3. My concept of folk songs was also a bit rigid. I said: "As the name suggests, folk songs are always the heartfelt voices naturally revealed among the people. Folk songs are usually the products of 'anonymous people,' collective products (also finished products collectively processed by the people in dissemination)." When applied to new folk songs, my words also make sense. Comrade Lu Xuebin raised in his article that attention should be paid to the "characteristic of mass character" of folk songs, saying that "folk songs are called folk songs because they can be sung," and also said, "In fact, many excellent folk songs are ultimately formed into relatively perfect works after continuous modification in the process of dissemination." However, the creation of new folk songs, becoming a movement, also includes another aspect, not limited to more spontaneous singing and more collective modification activities, but also including conscious writing of "poetry" (just called "poetry"!) by the masses and even the writing activities of some laborized intellectuals learning and using the folk song form in the masses. The meaning of new folk songs refers to the new folk song style mass creation. So my original statement was also a bit rigid.

4. The requirements I put forward for learning from new folk songs were also a bit too high. At the beginning of learning from new folk songs, I put forward the development of "unprecedented 'new' literature" from the creation of new folk songs, taking the form (broad form) of new folk songs "as a foundation," and "creating newer and more colorful poems," putting forward such a goal of struggle cannot be said to be bragging or unrealistic. However, in reality, the other aspect should also be taken into account, that is: starting from learning the superficial aspects of new folk songs, it is also possible to gradually grasp its essence. Ignoring this point, my statement also has side effects, making it difficult for intellectual poets who learn to write new folk songs. So I admit: it was also a bit too high.

Now the situation has developed further, what is my view on the issue of poetry development? In addition to recognizing some shortcomings in my statement mentioned above, I have not thought of modifying the basic views put forward in the article "Several Views" (that is, the points briefly introduced at the beginning of this article), but my views have always developed a little. Although I say this, my basic views half a year ago were actually similar to the views of most comrades (including some comrades who misunderstood my views), and now my views are basically similar to the views of most comrades (including Comrade Sha Ou), so there is really nothing new to say.

Simply put, new folk songs and new poetry (in content and form) will gradually merge, and we should promote this merging, promote the blooming of new poetry – letting a hundred flowers bloom.

Because the situation has developed like this: the cultural revolution is rising, the cultural level of the working masses is improving, the spontaneous singing of the working masses has developed into conscious writing of poetry, new folk songs have begun to break through fixed forms, and the possibility of new folk songs carrying forward the tradition of classical poetry and accepting the influence of new poetry has increased, etc. – this is one aspect. On the other hand, the process of intellectual laborization has intensified, poets writing new poetry have felt the pressure (that is, the driving force) of the vigorous development of new folk songs, have learned from new folk songs, the components originally derived from folk songs in new poetry have been valued, new poetry has accepted the influence of new folk songs, etc.

Some works among the current new folk songs are also new poetry – if the concept of "new poetry" is too narrow and cannot include new folk songs, then let's say "new poetry"!

The main component of "new poetry" must be that part developed on the basis of new folk songs, and it should be so. Because new folk songs inherit the national tradition more directly than new poetry, carry forward the national form, and have a far broader mass base.

As for classical poetry (including ancient folk songs), in form (whether in the narrow form or the broad form), it has a direct blood relationship with new folk songs (and past folk songs), and is the foundation of new folk songs. Therefore, we say "based on new folk songs and classical poetry" can also be understood as "mainly based on new folk songs."

Classical poetry and new folk songs, except that one is mainly in classical Chinese and the other is mainly in vernacular, basically belong to the same type in terms of expression methods, structure, etc. – the indigenous type. Although new folk songs and new poetry (excluding the folk song style part) are relatively close in terms of using vernacular, they basically belong to two different types in form – the latter is mainly influenced by foreign countries. Therefore, in the development of new poetry, there is only an inheritance issue between new folk songs and classical poetry, and there is only a merging issue between new folk songs and new poetry. In the merging of "native" and "foreign," with "native" as the main focus, and with the aspect developed on the basis of new folk songs as the main focus, I think it is also natural.

In the new poetry garden formed by merging, a hundred flowers will inevitably bloom, allowing for separate development based on other poetry types besides new folk songs, which can also promote the blooming of a hundred flowers. If all tributaries finally flow into the mainstream of new poetry, and the mainstream is divided into many tributaries, that is still the blooming of a hundred flowers inside and outside.

So from a developmental point of view, I think we might as well regard the new folk song movement as the new poetry movement.

Just as I said at the beginning of "Several Views" that my views are not yet mature, I must declare again at the end here that these views are still views that have not been considered mature.

    关于诗歌的发展问题
    卞之琳
    沙鸥同志在他的文章“新诗的道路问题”（见1958年12月31日“人民日报”七版）占全文一半篇幅的第四节开头，就“一年来”诗歌“形式问题”的“争论”，分析出五种错误说法，指定我（还有何其芳同志）代表其中的三种。五居其三，责任不小，我就出来说话。我想谈谈我的说法是不是这样，究竟怎样，我的说法有没有缺点，我现在的看法又是怎样。这样，我想，会有助于在讨论诗歌道路的时候，先扫清讨论道路，也给讨论本身多少提供一些参考。一
    我发表看法和引起争论的经过情况首先得说明一下。
    几年来，由于工作岗位关系，我极少写诗谈诗，很少能注意诗歌问题，更少参加争论。去年5、6月间，“处女地”一再邀约和敦促我就“新诗发展问题”（“处女地”出的题目原文）写一点自己的意见。我抽空匆匆写了千多字的一篇提纲式的小文，题目叫“对于新诗发展问题的几点看法”（以下简称“几点看法”），发表在“处女地”1958年7月号上。文中有关目前讨论的头四点，顺序说来，大意是这样：1、我们的社会“处在大跃进今日，遍地开花，遍地皆诗”，证诸世界各国文学史上的先例，“伟大的文学成就”只能从类似这样的情况里“发展出来”，而我们今日的形势是“跃进入社会主义社会的形势，因此我们可以肯定我们前无古人的‘新’文学就会从六亿人民的遍地歌声中一涌而出”。2、我们“应该首先学习新民歌”，可是不要只是机械模仿新民歌最表面的形式，只是套写写五七言句子，而是要首先通过新民歌在劳动人民的思想感情里受教育，其次主要学习新民歌的“风格”、“表现方式”、“语言”、“以便拿它们作为基础”，结合旧诗词和新诗的优良传统，甚至吸取外国诗歌的“可吸取的长处”，“来创造更新的更丰富多彩的诗篇”。3、以五七言韵语为主的民歌体不应是新诗歌的唯一形式，“五四”以来的新诗形式“也不应排斥”。4、“‘五四’以来的白话新诗”有“一个突出的缺点”，那“就是很少诗句能为大家所记住”；其中的“一个原因是：还没有形成一种为大家所公认的新格律”，不像民歌体大体上有一种传统的格律；另一个原因，“更重要的原因”“是不够精炼”，而“我国旧诗词似乎特别精炼”。这样说不知怎样激起了像宋垒同志那样的热心人的不满。宋垒同志在“诗刊”1958年10月号上发表了题为“与何其芳、卞之琳同志商榷”（以下简称“商榷”）的文章，抓片言只语，追“言外之意”，给了我（和何其芳同志）一个“轻视新民歌”的结论。“诗刊”要我答复，我就写了另一篇提纲式的小文“分歧在哪里？”（“诗刊”1958年11月号），只是“作几点说明，提几个问题”，没有发抒新见。宋垒同志又在“诗刊”（1958年12月号），发表了坚持说我“轻视新民歌”的文章：“分歧在这里”。现在沙鸥同志提出的我的三种错误说法，他的引证以及他的批评，都不出宋垒同志那两篇文章所提到的、引到的、批评到的范围。
    我也就分三点来谈谈。
    1、沙鸥同志说：“一种说法是：新民歌不过是以内容取胜，形式是旧东西，不足道”。这种说法可能是有的，可是他认为我（还有何其芳同志）就是作这种说法的，我得问问：有何根据？根据站得住吗？
    首先，我在“几点看法”一文里没有说过这样的话，也没有表示有这样的意思。只是，我在读了宋垒同志的“商榷”一文，见他把我的“几点看法”（还有何其芳同志的文章）的大意归纳出来，大半违反了原意，我在“分歧在哪里？”一文里，只就他说的何其芳同志和我认为“新民歌主要以内容取胜”这一点，说了一句“大致不差”。这就好像给了宋垒同志一个把柄。他在“分歧在这里”一文里就大胆推论说：你承认“新民歌主要以内容取胜”，你就是轻视新民歌的形式，你就是轻视新民歌。其实，他这样推论，本身就有问题。谁都知道作品内容和形式应该是统一的，可是我们并不因此就不能谈作品的内容或者形式。按照宋垒同志的说法，“内容决定形式”这类话也就包含了轻视形式的意思，轻视作品的意思了？陆学斌同志在他的“进一步发展新民歌运动”这一篇文章（见1958年12月10日“人民日报”七版）里说：“这些新的民歌，继承了过去民歌的传统，保持和发扬了过去民歌中优美的特色，但是在内容上和过去的民歌却有了根本的不同”。这不是也表明了新民歌的特色首先在内容上？这样，他难道也轻视新民歌吗？而我的“几点看法”一文也不是纯粹（以至主要）谈新民歌的形式问题，怎么就不能强调新民歌的内容？现在沙鸥同志在宋垒同志的推理基础上提高了一步，把“主要”换成了“不过是”，改成说“新民歌不过是以内容取胜”，因此推理说这样实质上就是“轻视民间的诗歌形式”，道理是比较圆满了，只是把这种看法派到我的头上，那就决不是“大致不差”，而是完全“差”了。
    其次，沙鸥同志引了我在“几点看法”一文里的一句——“可是要我们学习民歌，并不是要我们依样画葫芦来学‘写’民歌，因为那只能是伪造，注定要失败”——作为我轻视民歌形式的例证。他却不注意我底下的一段话——“我们学习新民歌，除了通过它在劳动人民的感情里（应该说“思想感情”里，大致是当时匆忙中漏写了“思想”两字——卞）受教育以外，主要是学习它的风格，它的表现方式，它的语言，以便拿它们作为基础，结合旧诗词的优良传统，‘五四’以来的新诗的优良传统，以至外国诗歌的可吸取的长处，来创造更新的更丰富多彩的诗篇”。而这一句正是宋垒同志推论我认为“新民歌主要以内容取胜”的主要“根据”。我在“分歧在哪里？”一文里已经提到了，现在我不妨再问：“风格”、“表现方式”
  “语言”，特别是“表现方式”，“在文学批评领域内说来”不属于“形式”一方面吗？沙鸥同志自己也说：“我们知道，诗的形式这个概念所包含的内容广泛得多，那受内容决定的形象，以及体裁、格式、结构、手法、韵律等东西，都应属于形式的概念中。而这些，又是利用语言来实现的。因此，如果把形式只当成是几言体的问题，就不免太简单了。”那么，我那样说，怎么就等于说新民歌的形式“不足道”呢？
    第三，我当时说那样的话多少是针对了知识分子学习新民歌，只在五言一句或七言一句，四句一首这样狭义的形式上机械模拟的倾向。所以我主张首先要有新民歌所表现的劳动人民的真情实感，其次要拿新民歌的形式（广义的形式）“作为基础”，吸取传统的以至外来的长处，具有创造性的发展我们的新诗歌。这当然不是一天两天内就可以做到的，可是我们应该有这样较长远的较高的奋斗目标。
    2、沙鸥同志说：“一种说法是：新民歌的形式无可学习的地方，应建立一种包括古今中外的一切优点的‘新格律诗’或‘现代格律诗’”。他指出我（还有何其芳同志）是作这种说法的。究竟怎样呢？关于“新民歌的形式无可学习”这部分，我在上面已经说明了我的说法并非如此，恰好相反。这里只要补充说一句，我在“分歧在哪里？”一文中确乎提到新民歌狭义的形式（“以五言‘体’、七言‘体’为主的诗歌‘体’”）不是新形式，可是说“旧”也并不就等于说“不足道”。现在只就格律问题这方面谈谈。
    首先，我在“几点看法”一文中，只是在谈到“五四”以来的白话新诗的缺点的时候，提到了不容易记忆的原因，才说了这样一句话：
  “一个原因是：还没有形成一种为大家所公认的新格律（押韵是格律的一部分；民歌体却大体上就有一种传统的格律的）。”因为宋垒同志在“商榷”一文里说我（和何其芳同志）架空设计一套“新格律”，我才在“分歧在哪里？”一文里说明，我解放以来很少谈诗歌的格律问题，说“我过去考虑新诗格律问题，就是根据了‘五四’以来诗歌创作的实践，根据了现代口语的特点，参考了古典诗歌和西方诗歌的规律，在中外诗歌音律的基本原理的指导下，进行了探索。我也并没有‘抛开’民歌体。”宋垒同志不相信我后边这句话，就推论说：“在这里，民歌既不可作根据，又不可作参考。”现在沙鸥同志也只引我前一句，更进一步指出我这样就“不顾劳动群众正在创作数以百万计的新民歌的事实”。请问：过去还没有大跃进新民歌，我怎么能预先顾到这个事实呢？
    其次，我说“‘五四’以来诗歌创作的实践”，怎么就能断定说我不把抗战歌谣这一类创作实践，新诗中运用歌谣体的创作实践，“王贵与李香香”这一类从民歌脱胎出来的创作实践，都不算在内呢？我说“古典诗歌”怎么就表示不包括像“诗经”国风这一类古代民歌呢？我说“西方诗歌”怎么就等于说不包括英国罗宾汉谣曲这一类民歌体裁呢？“民歌既不可作根据，又不可作参考”，即在过去，也不是我的想法。
    第三，诗歌格律问题也是文艺学的一部门。我们说诗歌要大体整齐，诗歌要押韵，这里就包含了格律问题。沙鸥同志自己归结出来的“今天的诗歌形式的”四点“基本面貌”差不多都包含格律问题。要是现在有人谈格律或者新格律，那也不等于否定新民歌。我在“几点看法”里，作为缺点，提到新诗“没有形成一种为大家所公认的新格律”；作为优点，提到了“民歌体却大体上就有一种传统的格律”。我并没有要“设计”新格律，排斥新民歌沿用的传统格律。我在“分歧在哪里？”一文里说过，新民歌极大多数就是格律诗。探讨诗歌格律问题，包括新民歌的格律问题，对于新诗歌的发展不会没有好处。
    3、沙鸥同志说：“一种说法是：民歌体有限制。这个意见有两个来源，一个来源是为了用‘有限制’的说法，来否定新民歌，或轻视新民歌，这显然是不正确的。”他认为我（还有何其芳同志）的“论点就有这种倾向”。我得谈一谈究竟怎样。
    我在“几点看法”一文中没有说过民歌体“有限制”这类话，只是说法里的确也包含了“有限制”的意思。我在“诗歌的民族形式不应了解为只是民歌的形式”这个提法里包含了这种意思；我在主张学习新民歌的风格、表现方式和语言“拿它们作为基础”，吸取旧诗词、新诗、以至外国诗的长处，“来创造更新的更丰富多彩的诗篇”这样一个提法里也包含了这种意思。“来源”如此，反过来说，我肯定民歌体“有限制”的目的也就明明是为了说明：
  （1）民歌体不应是唯一的形式，（2）新民歌需要发展。我在自己提出的拿新民歌的形式
  （广义的形式）“作为基础”来创造新诗歌的前提之下，提出这两个论点，怎么就是要“否定新民歌或轻视新民歌”呢？怎么就和沙鸥同志认为“正确的、也是有益的”另一种用意不接近或者相反呢？二
    那么，我的“几点看法”为什么那么容易受人误解呢？我对于诗歌发展问题的看法今天有没有什么发展？我现在就谈谈这两个方面。
    发生误解的客观原因，不由我负责，我不必谈。发生误解也有由我自己负责的主观原因，那就是：我的看法本身也确乎有一些缺点。
    1、我的说法里包含的“新民歌需要发展”和“民歌体不应是唯一的形式”这两个论点，提得也有点过早了。我在新民歌运动刚展开的时候，就对于新民歌当中发展出“更新的更丰富多彩”的新诗歌（以至“前无古人的‘新’文学”）表示期望，不能说过早；主张首先体会新民歌所表现的思想感情，主要拿新民歌的形式（广义的形式）“作为基础”，加以发展，对于写新诗的诗人说来，也不能说过早。同时，当时也确乎有主张用民歌的五、七言体统一诗歌形式的倾向，因此提出“百花齐放”的意思，也不能说过早吧？只是就当时整个形势说来，新民歌运动和学习新民歌运动还在开始，就提出“发展”问题，就提不用一种“体”统一形式的问题，要是吸引了大家过分的重视，那么对运动的消极作用就会大于积极作用。所以我现在承认：也有点过早。
    2、我提起格律问题，也有点不合时宜。我在新民歌创作蓬勃展开、新民歌佳句到处传诵的时候，除了注意到新民歌的内容对大家有重要的教育作用、新民歌的形式（广义的形式）可以作为新诗歌的发展基础以外，对比民歌体“大体上就有一种传统的格律”这一点事实，在诗人们重新考虑新诗缺点的时候，提一句新诗还没有“形成一种为大家所公认的新格律”，不能算不合时宜。如果有人因此考虑到、谈论到民歌体现有格律的长处短处，对于群众（和诗人）更好利用旧格律或者大胆突破旧格律，也有好处。可是，在创作新民歌的群众无意中已经多少表现了突破旧格律的尝试的时候，我提出格律问题，说格律重要，对于这种尝试，也会起消极作用。所以说：也有点不合时宜。
    3、我对于民歌的概念，也有点拘泥。我说：“顾名思义，民歌总是人民群众当中自然流露出来的心声。民歌照例是‘无名氏’的产品，集体的产品（也是经过人民群众在传播中集体加工的成品）。”引用到新民歌身上，我这几句话也有道理。陆学斌同志在他的文章里就提出要注意到民歌的“群众性这一特点”，说“民歌就是因为能唱才称为民歌的”，又说，“事实上，许多优秀的民歌，都是在传唱过程中，经过不断地修改，才最终形成了比较完美的作品”。然而，新民歌创作，成为运动，也已经包括了另一个方面，不限于自发性较多的唱出来、集体性较重的修改出来的创作活动，也包括群众中有意识写“诗”（就叫“诗”！）以至部分劳动化的知识分子在群众中学用民歌体写作的创作活动。新民歌的意思就是指新的民歌体群众创作。所以我原先的说法也就有点拘泥。
    4、我对于学习新民歌的要求提得也有点过高。一开始学习新民歌就提出从新民歌创作情况中发展出“前无古人的‘新’文学”，拿新民歌的形式（广义的形式）“作为基础”，“创造更新的更丰富多彩的诗篇”，提出这样的奋斗目标，总不能说夸口，不切实际。可是实际中的另一方面，也应顾到，那就是：从学习新民歌皮毛入手也可能逐渐得其神髓。忽视了这一点，我的提法也就有副作用，使学写新民歌的知识分子诗人感到为难。所以我承认：也有点过高。
    现在形势又向前发展了，我对于诗歌发展问题的看法怎样呢？除了认识到上面所讲的我的提法上一些缺点，我还没有想到要修改“几点看法”一文中所提出的基本看法（就是扼要介绍在本文前头的几点），只是我的看法也总有一点发展。话虽这样讲，我在半年前的基本看法实际上和大多数同志（包括误解我的看法的一些同志）的看法差不多，现在我的看法基本上也和大多数同志（包括沙鸥同志）的看法差不多，实在没有什么新意思可说。
    简单说来，新民歌和新诗（在内容上和形式上）会逐渐合流，我们应该促进这种合流，促进新诗歌开花——百花齐放。
    因为形势是这样发展了：文化革命高涨，劳动群众文化水平提高，劳动群众自发性歌唱发展到有意识写诗，新民歌开始在突破固定形式，新民歌发扬古典诗歌传统和接受新诗影响的可能性加大，等等——这是一方面。另一方面，知识分子劳动化过程加剧，写新诗的诗人感受了新民歌蓬勃发展的压力（也就是推动力），学习了新民歌，新诗中本来也有的从民歌脱胎出来的成分受到了重视，新诗接受了新民歌的影响，等等。
    目前新民歌当中有些作品也就是新诗——如果说“新诗”概念太狭，不能包括新民歌，那么我们就说“新诗歌”吧。
      “新诗歌”的主要构成部分必然是从新民歌基础上发展出来的那一部分，也应该如此。因为新民歌比诸新诗更直接继承了民族传统，发扬了民族形式，具有远为广大的群众基础。
    至于古典诗歌（包括古代民歌），形式上
  （无论在狭义的形式上或者广义的形式上）它和新民歌（以及过去的民歌）有直接的血缘关系，是新民歌的根柢。因此我们说“以新民歌和古典诗歌为基础”也可以了解为“主要以新民歌为基础”。
    古典诗歌和新民歌，除了一则以文言为主，一则以白话为主，在表现方式、结构等等方面基本上属于同一类型——土生土长的类型。新民歌和新诗（除去其中民歌体部分），虽然在运用白话这一点上比较接近，形式上基本属于两个不同类型——后者主要是受的外来影响。因此，在新诗歌的发展当中，新民歌和古典诗歌之间只有承继问题，新民歌和新诗之间才有合流问题。在“土”“洋”合流中以“土”为主，以新民歌基础上发展出来的一方面为主，我想也是自然而然。
    在合流而成的新诗歌园地内必然会百花齐放，容许以新民歌以外的别种诗歌类型为基础而另行发展，也可以促成百花齐放。如果所有支流终于都汇流入新诗歌主流，主流里又分出许多支流，那仍然是内内外外的百花齐放。
    所以从发展观点看，我认为我们不妨把新民歌运动就当作新诗歌运动。
    正如我在“几点看法”的开头说过我的看法还没有成熟，我在这里结尾处又得声明，我这些看法还是没有考虑成熟的看法。
