Exhibition is also a Science
　　Qin Li

　　In the past, I always felt that various exhibitions, although they could more or less provide the audience with knowledge and education in a certain aspect, sometimes lacked some captivating magic. But recently, many of us have suddenly developed a strong interest in exhibitions. Some have visited several in a row for days, returning to talk about them with relish and praise them to the skies. This time we visited the "National Patriotic Health Campaign Exhibition."

　　It was indeed good! In addition to the usual pictures, statistical tables, models, and objects that are necessary, the exhibition added slides, electrically illuminated charts, small stages, live recordings, and even movies. The variety was diverse, novel, and interesting. What is especially worth mentioning is the way the guides explained things. It was no longer a rigid, lengthy string of words, but varied according to the audience, sometimes brief and sometimes detailed, with speaking, singing, and dialogue. Most of the singing was in the form of quick-patter rhymes, but later I found that they also sang local tunes. When we visited the Zhejiang Pavilion, a female guide lively and vividly introduced the exhibition to the audience in the form of quick-patter rhymes. One of our companions said with a smile, "The Zhejiang Pavilion can sing Yue opera to introduce it." The guide said seriously, "We do sing Yue opera. If you want to hear it, I will sing." And she really sang. As we went along, the Hebei Pavilion sang drum songs, and the Shanxi, Hubei, and other pavilions all sang their own local tunes. The Guangdong Pavilion was even more wonderful, singing folk songs in the Cantonese dialect. Didn't understand? No problem, there was a translation.

　　This shows that exhibitions can be made lively, vivid, and colorful. It is a science in itself. How to carefully design, arrange, display, and edit is worth studying, and there is much to be done, and it should not be done simply. Explanation is even more important. This exhibition has proven that wherever the gongs and drums sound, a large number of audiences will flock there. If you want to make the exhibition lively and bustling (which is precisely the purpose of the exhibition, so as to attract more audiences to receive education and gain knowledge), you must study this science.

　　But if you go with the idea of watching the fun and listening to the opera, you are bound to be disappointed. After all, it is not a fairground or a theater (nor should it be made into one), and the guides are not actors. Take this exhibition, for example, it is not perfect. But it is always worth seeing, and you will benefit a lot from seeing it.

　　As a science, I think there should be some works on experience and methods in this area, but now I see very few, but gradually, there will be more!

    展览会也是一门学问
    秦犁
    以前我总觉得，各种展览会，虽然或多或少都能使观众获得某个方面的知识和教育，有时候也缺乏些引人入胜的魔力。可是最近，我们许多人忽然对展览会发生了浓厚的兴趣，有的接连几天去看了好几个，回来津津乐道，赞不绝口。这一回我们参观的是“全国爱国卫生运动展览会”。
    果真不差！展览会上除了照例摆设着必需有的图片、统计表、模型、实物外，增加了幻灯、电光指示的图表和小舞台、实况录音，还有电影。品种多样，新颖有趣。尤其值得一提的是解说员的解说方式，不再是刻板的冗长一串，而是因对象而异，或简或详，有说有唱有对话。唱时多半是用快板，但后来发现还唱地方曲调。我们参观到浙江馆，一位女解说员活泼生动地用快板形式向观众作了一番介绍，我们一位同伴笑着说：“浙江馆可以唱越剧来介绍。”那解说员认真地说：“是也唱越剧的呀，你们要听，我就唱。”真地唱起来了。一路参观过去，河北馆唱大鼓，山西、湖北等馆都各唱自己的地方曲调。广东馆更妙，用广东方言唱民歌。听不懂吗？不妨，还有翻译哩。
    由此可见，展览会完全可以办得生动活泼、丰富多彩些的。它自成一门学问，怎样精心设计、布置、摆设、编辑，都值得研究，都大有可为，且不可简单从事。解说更其十分重要，这个展览会上事实证明，哪里锣鼓一响，哪里就有大批观众涌过去。如果想把展览会办得热热闹闹，轰轰烈烈（展览的目的正是如此，以便吸引更多的观众去受教育、得知识），不可不研究这门学问。
    但倘若你抱着看热闹、听唱戏的想头而去，那准定是要失望的。那里毕竟不是游艺场、戏院（也不应该办成那样），解说员也不是演员。就说这个展览会，也不是达到尽善尽美的地步了。不过总归值得一看，看了受益多。
    作为一门学问，我想应该有些这方面的经验方法的著作，现在还极少看到，渐渐，会多起来的吧！
