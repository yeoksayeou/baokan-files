    Socialist Light Illuminates the Korean Countryside
    By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    "Earth-Shaking" Changes
    Korean farmers in recent years have used the phrase "earth-shaking" to describe the enormous changes taking place in the Korean countryside.
    The changes in the Korean countryside in recent years have primarily been the victorious completion of agricultural collectivization. After the war, in the winter of 1953, Korea established its first agricultural cooperatives. These first cooperatives were composed of a small number of poor farmers. At that time, Korean agriculture was severely damaged by the war, large numbers of draught animals were killed, manpower was scarce, and good rice paddies were riddled with bomb craters. However, the power of the farmers working together overcame all these difficulties, and in the first year of production in 1954, it demonstrated its superiority, with the grain yield per unit area of the cooperatives being 10%-50% higher than that of individual farmers.
    Only five years have passed, and the scene in the Korean countryside is completely different. Today, the raging fire of the collectivization movement has spread throughout the mountain villages at the foot of Mount Paektu and the rural areas of the newly liberated areas south of the 38th parallel. Nearly all of the millions of farmers in North Korea joined cooperatives by the end of August last year. The vast fields have also changed their appearance. Newly built irrigation canals crisscross the land. In the five years since the war, the area of irrigated paddy fields has doubled, from more than 220,000 chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu) to more than 460,000 chongbo. The bomb craters are gone, and small pieces of land have been connected into large tracts. The New Sun Agricultural Cooperative, which I recently visited, has already combined the original four thousand small fields into one hundred and sixty-five large plots. Tractors are running on these fields, which are as flat as a sports field. In the five years since the war, the area of mechanized farming in Korea has increased twelvefold.
    In the past, it was considered good if a chongbo of rice paddy in Korea yielded two or three tons, and a yield of ten tons was considered a miracle. However, last year, the Douyan Agricultural Cooperative in Gangnam County created a record of 55 tons per chongbo on 1.5 chongbo of land. Last year, the grain output in North Korea reached 3.63 million tons, double that of the early days of liberation in 1946.
    This achievement was obtained under very poor climatic conditions. For the first eight months of last year, Korea experienced a rare drought, with rainfall less than half of the normal amount. In particular, May and June were the time for transplanting rice seedlings, and there was no rain in most parts of North Korea. The entire population of North Korea, including farmers, workers, People's Army soldiers, and students, mobilized to fight the drought. At that time, I visited Yuan Shanhua, an elderly farmer of sixty-four years, in the drought-fighting army of Douyan Cooperative in Gangnam County. He said that forty years ago, there had been such a severe drought. That year, his land was not planted with rice in time. Later, near autumn, he planted some beans, and a large piece of land yielded only one basket. In the end, he had to leave his hometown and flee from famine. However, last year, men and women, old and young, worked together to fight the natural disaster. Even the Young Pioneers in schools carried water in basins to water the cotton fields in teams. Finally, the cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, with an average yield of thirteen tons for the one hundred and sixty chongbo of paddy fields they planted.
    This is the "earth-shaking" change that farmers are talking about. It is the correct agricultural policy of the Korean Workers' Party that has opened up a new world in the Korean countryside. It is the light of socialism that has illuminated a broad path for Korean farmers.
    Three "-izations" Upsurge
    If the victories achieved in Korean agriculture in the first five years after the war were great, then the ambitions of the Korean farmers, who have completed collectivization and are riding the Chollima (thousand-li horse), are even greater this year in agricultural production. Judging from this year's situation, if any agricultural cooperative proposes a target that is double that of last year, that target is probably the most conservative. The Korean Workers' Party proposed in September last year to increase grain production to seven million tons in the next six or seven years, but Korean farmers want to produce five million tons this year.
    In order to achieve this leap forward target, a technical revolution is being carried out in the countryside, and farmers have launched an upsurge to achieve water conservancy, electrification, and mechanization.
    At present, there are more than 10,000 large and small water conservancy and irrigation projects under construction in North Korea, including the Yalu River irrigation project, which is invested by the state and built with modern technology to irrigate 100,000 chongbo, and the Qiyang irrigation project, which irrigates 40,000 chongbo. There are also small reservoirs and pumping stations built by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. Water conservancy has become a nationwide movement. Everywhere, mountains are being split, rivers are being blocked, wells are being dug, and ponds are being built. The goal is to expand the irrigated area by one million chongbo in two or three years, making the entire North Korea a place free from drought and flood and ensuring a continuous bumper harvest.
    On these large and small construction sites, whether built by workers or farmers, whether built with foreign methods or local methods, everyone is working with soaring enthusiasm, and every project must be completed ahead of schedule.
    I recently visited the Qingdan irrigation project in Huanghai South Road, which can irrigate 20,000 chongbo. This project only started in October last year and was originally scheduled to be completed in 1961, but the workers and farmers must complete it before April 15 this year – the birthday of Premier Kim Il-sung. The most difficult part of this project is to dig an eight-kilometer-long tunnel through a high mountain. In order to complete the project ahead of schedule, the workers came up with a clever method: they would dig nine inclined shafts on the mountain to divide the tunnel into nine sections to be opened up. On the dam of the Changshou Reservoir of this project, a tall flagpole stands, with three flags of red, green, and blue hanging on it. These are the signs of the competition between the young farmers of the three counties. On the day I went, the green flag representing Xinchuan County had just flipped from the bottom to the top. The young farmers of Xinchuan County have recently laid light railways and implemented fast loading and running, resulting in an increase from an average of 2.5 cubic meters of soil dug and transported per person per day to 4 to 5 cubic meters. The farmers in the other two counties are not lagging behind. They are building aerial cableways and foot-powered mechanical rammers to catch up.
    In order to achieve electrification in the countryside, agricultural cooperatives in various places are building their own small hydroelectric, thermal, and wind power stations. This movement has now reached a climax. Hamgyong South Road is building 159 stations, and Jagang Road is building 149 stations. Farmers in Jagang Road are determined to achieve electrification this year, with electric lights in every household, and labor such as threshing, sawing, and grass cutting will be powered by electricity. At present, 47% of the rural areas in the entire North Korea have electricity, and complete electrification will be achieved in one or two years.
    Korea will supply 30,000 to 35,000 tractors and 25,000 to 30,000 cars to the countryside in four to five years, so that the countryside can be mechanized. Farmers are now widely carrying out small-scale mechanization movements, and various improved agricultural implements, animal-powered weeding machines, and seeders have appeared one after another. In some places, the heavy ox carts that Korean farmers have used for thousands of years have been installed with ball bearings. In some places, the short-handled hoes that Korean farmers have used for thousands of years have been discarded and replaced with more efficient long-handled improved hoes.
    In addition to implementing the three "-izations," farmers are vigorously accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing the land. Both the autumn plowing of last year and the spring plowing of this year must be plowed to more than 30 centimeters. Seeing the soaring enthusiasm of the Korean farmers, an even greater harvest in Korea this year is entirely expected.
    Building a New Socialist Countryside
    When I recently visited the rural areas of Wendok County, South Pyongan Road, I saw the scene of vigorous cultural construction in the Korean countryside.
    The time was early winter last year. In the fields, new houses were newly erected everywhere. On the distant hillside, a two-story red building was being built. The Deputy Chairman of the Wendok County People's Committee, who was traveling with me, said that it was a newly built middle school, which was built by the state in this county last year. The agricultural cooperatives themselves wanted to build fifteen schools, and seven have already been built.
    Last year, the cooperatives in the county built a thousand new cultural houses, all with tiled roofs and glass windows. The number of thatched houses converted into tiled houses is not included. The Far East Agricultural Cooperative converted all of the more than 200 houses in the cooperative into tiled houses in one year last year. The county itself built brick and tile factories and cement factories, and also sent some people to the mountains of Paektu Mountain to cut wood. This year, it plans to build 4,000 new cultural houses. By 1961, Wendok County will be completely changed. All villages will be rebuilt according to the new blueprint, with new houses, new streets, new schools, new shops... In a word, a socialist countryside will be built.
    Our destination was the Bofei Agricultural Cooperative. On both sides of a newly opened wide street in this village, more than 100 newly built cultural houses are neatly arranged, of which more than 70 households were built in 1958. Last year, the average rice yield per chongbo in the Bofei Agricultural Cooperative reached 5 tons, and each household could receive an average of 3 tons of rice and 18,000 North Korean won. Due to the increase in the income of the members, they will expand construction this year, building a total of 200 new cultural houses. In addition, all current thatched houses will be rebuilt into tiled houses, so that all 784 farm households will live in tiled houses.
    In addition, on a hillside next to the village, a two-story red building - the school building of Bofei Middle School - was completed last year. It has 24 classrooms, and more than 1,100 students are studying inside. Its scale is no less than that of a middle school in Pyongyang. But it was successfully built by the agricultural cooperative itself. Now, the cooperative is building shops, nurseries, and clubs. From here, people can already see the magnificent and beautiful outline of the new socialist countryside of Korea. (Attached picture)

    社会主义光芒照耀下的朝鲜农村
    本报记者　王玉章
    “开天辟地”般的变化
    朝鲜农民近年来用“开天辟地”这个字眼来形容朝鲜农村中发生的巨大变化。
    近几年来朝鲜农村中的变化，首先是农业合作化的胜利完成。战后，1953年冬天，朝鲜成立了第一批农业合作社。这一批农业合作社都是由少数的贫农组成的。当时朝鲜的农业遭到战争的惨重破坏，大批的耕畜被杀，人力缺乏，大好的稻田到处布满了炸弹坑。但是，农民们合作起来的力量冲破了这一切困难，在1954年第一年的生产中就显示了它的优越性，合作社的谷物单位面积产量比单干户高出10％—50％。
    时间仅仅过了五年，朝鲜农村中的光景已经完全两样了，今天合作化运动的燎原之火已烧遍了白头山麓的山村和三八线以南的新解放区的农村，朝鲜北部几百万农民在去年8月底就差不多全部入了社。广大的田野也改变了面貌，新修起的灌溉渠道纵横交错，战后五年水田灌溉面积翻了一番，由二十二万多町步（一町步约合十五市亩）增加到四十六万多町步。炸弹坑不见了，小片的土地已被连成了大片。记者最近访问的新太阳农业社，就已把原来的四千多块小田拼成了一百六十五块大片田，拖拉机正在这些平整得像运动场一样的田上奔驰着。战后五年朝鲜的机耕面积跃增了十二倍。
    过去朝鲜的水田每町步收二吨、三吨就算不错，收到十吨就算奇迹了。可是去年江南郡斗岩农业社在一点五町步的田地上创造了每町步收五十五吨的丰产纪录。去年朝鲜北部的粮产量达到了三百六十三万吨，比解放初期1946年翻了一番。
    这种成绩是在非常不好的气候条件下取得的。去年头八个月，朝鲜遇上稀有的干旱，降雨量比不上常年的一半，特别是5、6月份正是插秧播种的时候，朝鲜北部大部分地区都没有下雨。整个朝鲜北部的农民、工人、人民军战士、学生都动员起来同干旱作斗争。当时在江南郡斗岩社的抗旱大军里，记者访问了六十四岁的老农民元善瑚，他说，在四十年以前这里也曾遇到过一次这样的旱灾，那年他的地没有及时种上稻，后来快到秋天了，种了些豆子，一大片的地只收了一筐，最后不得不离乡背井去逃荒。可是，去年这里的男女老少一齐起来同天灾斗争，就连学校里的红领巾也一队队地用盆顶水浇棉花。最后，这个社去年取得了空前的丰收，他们种的一百六十町步水田，平均产量达到了十三吨。
    这就是农民们所说的“开天辟地”般的变化，是朝鲜劳动党的正确的农业政策在朝鲜的农村中开辟了一个新天地，是社会主义的光芒给朝鲜农民照亮了广阔的大道。
    三“化”高潮
    如果说在战后头五年朝鲜农业方面取得的胜利很大的话，完成了合作化、骑上了千里马的朝鲜农民今年在农业生产上的雄心壮志就更加大了。以今年的情况来看，任何一个农业社如果提出的指标比去年增加一倍，这个指标恐怕是最保守的了。朝鲜劳动党去年9月提出了在最近六、七年内使粮食产量达到七百万吨的号召，可是朝鲜农民今年就要生产五百万吨。
    为了实现这个跃进目标，在农村实行技术革命，农民们掀起了实现水利化、电气化、机械化的高潮。
    目前朝鲜北部正在兴建的大大小小的水利灌溉工程共有一万多个，其中有国家投资、用现代化技术兴建的灌溉十万町步的鸭绿江灌溉工程，灌溉四万町步的岐阳灌溉工程等，也有农业社自己兴修的小水库、小抽水站。水利化已成为一个全民性的运动，到处都在劈山拦河，挖井修塘，要在二、三年内扩大一百万町步灌溉面积，使整个朝鲜北部成为不知旱涝、永保丰收的地方。
    在这些大大小小的工地上不论是工人修的或者是农民修的，不论是用洋法修的还是用土法修的，到处人人干劲冲天，每个工程都要提前完工。
    记者最近访问了能灌溉二万町步的黄海南道青丹灌溉工程，这个工程从去年10月才开工，原定1961年完工，可是工人、农民们非在今年4月15日——金日成首相的诞辰以前修成不可。这个工程中最艰巨的是从一座高山上打一条八公里长的隧道。工人们为了使工程提前完工，想了一个妙法，他们要在这座山上开凿九条斜井，把隧道分成九段来打通。在这个工程的长寿水库的水坝上，矗立着一根高高的旗杆，上面悬挂着红、绿、蓝三面旗子，这是三个郡的青年农民进行竞赛的标志。记者去的那一天，代表信川郡的绿旗刚刚从最下面翻到最上面来了。信川郡的青年农民最近铺设了轻便铁道，实行快装快跑，结果由每人每天平均挖运二点五立方土提高到四立方到五立方土。另外两个郡的农民也不落后，他们正在搞空中飞的索道吊车，搞脚踏机械硪，迎头赶上来。
    为了实现农村的电气化，各地的农业社正在自己修建小型的水力、火力、风力发电站。这个运动现在已达到高潮。咸镜南道正在建设一百五十九所，慈江道建设一百四十九所，慈江道农民决心在今年就实现电气化，家家户户有电灯，打谷、锯木、切草等劳动都用电力。整个朝鲜北部现在有47％的农村有了电，要在一、二年内完全实现电气化。
    朝鲜要在四、五年内供应农村三万到三万五千辆拖拉机，二万五千到三万辆汽车，使农村实现机械化。农民们现在已广泛展开小机械化运动，各种改良农具、畜力锄草机、播种机纷纷出现。有的地方已把朝鲜农民用了几千年的笨重的牛车安装上滚珠，有的地方已把朝鲜农民用了几千年的短柄锄头抛掉，而改用了效率更高的长柄的改良锄头。
    除了实行三“化”以外，农民们正在大力积肥，深耕土地。去年的秋耕和今年的春耕都要耕到三十公分以上。看到朝鲜农民们的冲天干劲，今年朝鲜更大的丰收是完全可以预期的。
    建设社会主义的新农村
    记者最近访问平安南道文德郡的农村时，看到了朝鲜农村蓬蓬勃勃进行文化建设的景象。
    时间是去年的初冬，在田野上一眼望去到处都是新矗立起来的新住宅。在远处的山岗上，一幢二层的红楼正建设起来，同行的文德郡人民委员会副委员长说，那是新建的中等学校，去年由国家出钱在这个郡盖的，各农业社自己要建十五所，已经建成了七所。
    去年郡内各社新建了一千户新的文化住宅，都是一色瓦房、玻璃窗。草房改成瓦房的还不计算在内。远东农业社在去年一年内又把社内二百多家的房子全部改成了瓦房。郡内自己新建了砖瓦厂、水泥厂，还派了一些人到白头山里去砍木头，今年准备新建的文化住宅达四千幢。到1961年文德郡就要全部变一个样子，所有的村庄都按照新的蓝图重新改建，新的住宅、新的街道、新的学校、新的商店……总的一句话，建成社会主义农村。
    我们访问的目的地是博飞农业社。在这个村内的一条新辟的广阔的大街两旁，整齐地排列着一百多幢新建的文化住宅，其中有七十多户是1958年盖的。去年博飞农业社每町步水稻平均产量达到了五吨，每户可平均分得三吨稻谷和一万八千元朝币。由于社员收入的增加，今年他们要扩大建设，共新建二百幢文化住宅，另外，把目前所有的草房都改建为瓦房，使所有的七百八十四户农户都住上瓦房。
    另外，在村旁的一座山岗上一座二层红楼——博飞中学的校舍已在去年建成，它有二十四个教室，现在有一千一百多名学生在里边学习。它的规模丝毫也不比平壤的中学逊色。但它却是这个农业社自己建设成功的。现在，这个社正在建设着商店、托儿所、俱乐部。从这里人们已可以看出朝鲜的社会主义新农村的宏伟美丽的轮廓。（附图片）
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国去年的谷物获得了大丰收。这是“正义之路”农业合作社的社员们在欢庆丰收。
