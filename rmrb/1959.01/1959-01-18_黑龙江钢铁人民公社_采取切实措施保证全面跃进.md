Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 17th: The Daduchuan Steel People's Commune in Dongning County, Heilongjiang Province, when formulating the 1959 production plan, launched a great airing of views, great debates, and summarized the experience of the 1958 Great Leap Forward in production, and inspected the various measures to increase production this year, creating conditions for a greater leap forward in production this year.

In 1958, the average grain yield per mu of this commune increased from 140 jin in 1957 to more than 470 jin. The facts of the 1958 Great Leap Forward in production proved that it is entirely possible to greatly increase grain production this year, and the claim that grain production has already "reached the sky" is incorrect. In the debate, various production measures this year were examined, and it was found that the whole commune was still short of 50% of manure; water conservancy construction was still far from meeting the requirements; the quality of seeds was not good enough; and the experience of reforming the cultivation system had not been summarized sufficiently. Everyone agreed that to make a greater leap forward in production this year, it is necessary to continue to make great efforts and do a lot of work.

After the great airing of views and great debates, the members and cadres of the commune not only mustered up the energy to achieve a greater leap forward, but also realized that various production-increasing measures to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward targets must be implemented in a down-to-earth manner. Now, the commune has launched a wave of production preparation work. One hundred and twenty people are actively engaged in water conservancy projects. The commune has established dense planting laboratories to observe and experiment with the growth of various crops under dense planting. The 1959 production targets, plot divisions, and measure requirements, which have been discussed, have all been implemented to the teams. The third team of the Daduchuan Management Area inspected the plots of land under its responsibility and found that there were three places where water could not be accessed, and immediately studied ways to raise the pond embankments and took measures to ensure a bumper harvest without rain. According to the arable land area and production plan, each team has formulated specific steps for accumulating fertilizer, and quickly launched a competition to produce local chemical fertilizer. In just two days, the whole commune built more than 680 small kilns for burning local chemical fertilizer, with a daily output of more than 100,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer. Each management area has comprehensively arranged labor, and specialized groups have also been established in the sideline industry to carry out sideline production.

    采取切实措施保证全面跃进
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省东宁县大肚川钢铁人民公社，在制订1959年生产规划时，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，总结1958年生产大跃进的经验，检查今年的各项增产措施，给今年生产更大跃进创造了条件。
    这个公社1958年平均每亩粮食产量，由1957年的一百四十斤增加到四百七十多斤。1958年生产大跃进的事实证明，今年的粮食产量完全有可能大大增加，认为粮食产量已经“顶天”的说法是不对的。在辩论中，检查了今年生产的各项措施，发现全社粪肥尚缺50％；水利建设离要求还远；种子质量还不够好；耕作制度改革的经验也还总结得不够。大家一致认为，要使今年生产更大跃进，还需要继续做很大努力，做很多工作。
    经过大鸣大放大辩论，这个公社的社员、干部不仅鼓足了实现更大跃进的干劲，同时也认识到保证实现今年跃进指标的各项增产措施必须踏踏实实地实行。现在，这个公社已经掀起了生产准备工作热潮。有一百二十人正在积极兴修水利工程。公社建立密植试验室，观察、试验各种作物密植生长的情况。经过讨论的1959年的生产指标、地块划分和措施要求，已经全部落实到队。大肚川管理区第三队检查了自己负责的地块，发现有三处上不去水，立即研究了加高塘坝的办法，采取了保证实现无雨保丰收的措施。各队根据耕地面积和产量计划，都拟定了积肥的具体步骤，迅速掀起了大搞土化肥的竞赛运动，仅两天时间全公社就建起了烧土化肥的小窑六百八十多个，日产土化肥十万多斤。各管理区都已全面安排了劳动力，副业方面也建立起专门小组，开展了副业生产。
