    “Little Director” Cui Xiangqin
    Tan Zhong
    Eighteen-year-old Cui Xiangqin is a teacher at the Li Ma Village Kindergarten in Xingtai County, Hebei Province. People call her "Little Director." Their kindergarten was established in 1955 (then a toddler team) and now has 110 children, including 35 full-time children. The kindergarten also has five teachers and one childcare worker.
    When she was fifteen years old, she had just graduated from elementary school, and the agricultural cooperative asked her to go to the county for childcare training. She thought: I'm still young, I can't look after children! Her mother was even more unwilling. But she thought that she was a member of the Communist Youth League, how could she not follow the assignment? After listening to the report in the county, she realized that taking good care of children could liberate more women to engage in production, and it was a glorious job to cultivate successors for the motherland.
    After returning to the village, she started working with Cui Xiuqin and Cui Aiqin. On the day the toddler team was established, seven or eight children came. As soon as the children left their mothers, they either made noise or cried. The three of them hugged and coaxed one child after another, sweating profusely, but still couldn't coax them well, so they had to send the children home. The next day, more than a dozen came, and the children were even more chaotic. Their voices were hoarse, and they couldn't take care of everyone. In the blink of an eye, a child fell into the latrine, and they were busy washing the child. Then a child named Zhongxing was squeezed off a stone, and a big bump appeared on his head. The child's mother came immediately after hearing about it and said angrily: "How do you look after the children! I told you you couldn't do it, what do you know?" Cui Xiangqin was so sad at the time that she wanted to cry, and couldn't even eat when she got home. Her mother kept grumbling beside her: "I told you not to do it, you little person insists on looking after other people's children." Xiuqin and Aiqin were also a little discouraged at this time. Her thinking was also contradictory, "Only these few children, and it's so tiring, and I can't take good care of them, how can I continue?" At this time, the Party branch found out and immediately talked to them. The branch secretary said to her: Every job is "difficult at the beginning," as long as you have the determination, you can overcome the difficulties. She also thought: "If we have difficulties in doing it, wouldn't others have the same difficulties in doing it? Can a member of the League give way in the face of difficulties?" Thinking of this, she regained confidence.
    In order to overcome this initial difficulty, she went to the elementary school to ask the teachers for advice, and also bought a booklet called "How to Educate Children" in the bookstore, and studied it carefully. At first, the children were shy and didn't like to come to the toddler team. They tried their best to lead the children to play, playing hide-and-seek, throwing handkerchiefs, cat and mouse games; they also found some materials from newspapers and periodicals to compose songs and teach the children to sing. The children gradually became interested in the toddler team, the crying decreased, and they finally passed the first hurdle and coaxed the children. But at that time, there were not many children joining the team. In order to eliminate the masses' concerns that the toddler team would not take good care of the children, at a community members' meeting, they led the children to sing two songs on stage and danced. The children sang, gesticulating with their small hands. When dancing, they were even more lovable. At that time, some community members said happily: "In the past, I only felt that the girls didn't have the experience of taking care of children, but I didn't expect that the children would learn these skills after only a few days in the toddler team." Since then, the number of children joining the team has increased rapidly.
    In several years of practice, they understood the children's psychology, and enlightened and guided them through concrete examples according to the children's different personalities, with more praise and less criticism. At the beginning, the children didn't like to wash their faces, and they cried as soon as they washed. Only Wang Huiqiao was the cleanest, so they praised Huiqiao and asked the children to learn from her. When Cui Suifa, who hated washing his face the most, was willing to wash his face, he was immediately praised. They also consciously taught the children to sing: "The little cat comes to eat, after eating, wash your face, clean people like it, dirty people hate it." In this way, the children were willing to wash their faces and hands. Seven-year-old Cui Qiuzeng was the most famous "little rascal" in the village, hitting and scolding people, and no one could control him. As soon as they heard that he was going to join the toddler team, the mothers of other children in the village disagreed, fearing that their children would be bullied. Sure enough, Cui Qiuzeng cried three or four children less than a day after arriving at the kindergarten. Once, he fought with others again, and he himself was beaten. Cui Xiangqin called him aside and asked him if it hurt to be beaten. He said: "It hurts!" Cui Xiangqin asked him again, "Then if you hit others, does it hurt others?" Cui Qiuzeng didn't speak. She also asked him to lead the children to play, so that he could control himself first. In this way, Cui Qiuzeng gradually changed for the better. In order to cooperate with parents to carry out better education, they went to the children's homes to visit whenever they had time to understand the children's situation. So that the children not only listened to the adults and loved to work in the toddler team, but also listened to the adults at home and took the initiative to help their mothers with housework. When they found some children telling lies, they patiently educated them so that the children knew the harm of telling lies.
    Soon after the realization of the people's commune, the kindergarten also added full-time care services. She and the village women's federation director and teachers excitedly fought continuously for several days and nights, repairing houses, painting walls, and preparing beds for the children. The kindergarten developed, and the teachers also increased. The new teachers were still in high spirits at the beginning, but after a few days, the thoughts of being dirty and afraid of being tired came. Some said that looking after children was too boring, and it was not as happy as going to the fields to produce, and they didn't want to do it anymore. Some were impatient when they saw children with runny noses and said: "Give you some paper and wipe it yourself." Sometimes the children slipped home by themselves without knowing it, but complained that the children were not easy to take care of. She organized everyone to discuss and find the reasons. After repeated discussions, everyone admitted that it was because they had not fulfilled their responsibilities. She introduced the words of the Party that educated her, as well as her own experience to them. She told them the importance of cultivating new communist people, and used the vision of the toddler team developing from small to large, step by step to encourage them. Now they are all full of energy, striving to be the first in their work, and their enthusiasm for studying their profession is also very high. Every little progress of the children makes them feel extremely happy. When they get together, they often say: "As long as there is a need, we will never leave the children in our whole lives."

    “小园长”崔香琴
    谭中
    十八岁的崔香琴，是河北省邢台县李马村幼儿园的教养员。人们都叫她“小园长”。她们的幼儿园是1955年建立的（当时是幼儿队），现在有一百一十个孩子，其中有全托三十五名。园内还有五名教养员，一名保育员。
    她十五岁时刚小学毕业，农业社叫她到县里去受保育员训练。她想：自己还小咧，看不了孩子！她母亲更不愿意。可是她想到自己是个共青团员，怎能不听从分配呢？到县里听了报告，认识到看好孩子能解放出更多的妇女搞生产，能为祖国培养接班人，是很光荣的工作。
    回村后，她就和崔秀琴、崔爱琴三人开始了工作。幼儿队成立的那天去了七、八个孩子，孩子们乍一离开妈妈，不是打闹，就是哭叫，三个人抱这个哄那个，急得满头大汗，还是哄不好，只得把孩子送回家去。第二天到了十几个，孩子一多更乱了，嗓子也喊哑了，顾了这个顾不上那个。一转眼，有个孩子掉进了茅坑，她们忙着给这孩子洗。接着一个叫中兴的孩子在石头上被挤下来，头上碰了个大疙瘩。这孩子的妈妈听说后马上找来，气冲冲地说：“你们怎么看的孩子呀！说你们干不了，怎么样？”崔香琴当时难过得想哭，回家连饭也吃不下。她妈妈又在一旁不断地嘟哝：“说不叫你干，小小的人偏偏愿意给人家看孩子。”秀琴、爱琴这时也有点灰心了。她的思想也很矛盾，“才这几个孩子，累得够受，还看不好，怎么干下去呢？”这时，党支部知道了，马上找她们谈话。支部书记向她说：啥工作都是“头三脚难踢”，只要有决心就能克服困难。她也想：“我们干有困难，让别人干不是同样有困难吗？团员能在困难面前让步吗？”想到这里，又有了信心。
    她为了克服这个开头难，就到小学校里去向教师请教，又到书店买了本“怎样教育孩子”的小册子，用心地钻研学习。最初，孩子们认生不爱到幼儿队来。她们就想尽办法领孩子们玩，作藏猫、丢手帕、猫捉鼠等游戏；又从报刊找些材料编歌教孩子们唱。孩子们渐渐地对幼儿队发生了兴趣，哭闹的减少了，总算过了第一关，把孩子哄住了。但当时入队的孩子还是不多。为了消除群众怕幼儿队带不好孩子的顾虑，在一次社员大会上，她们领着孩子们到台上唱了两支歌，又跳了舞。孩子们唱着，小手比划着。跳舞时更是逗人爱。当时有的社员高兴地说：“过去光觉得姑娘们没带孩子的经验，没想到孩子才入幼儿队几天就学会了这些本事。”从那以后，孩子们入队的人数迅速增加。
    她们在几年的实践中，懂得了孩子的心理，根据孩子的不同性格通过具体事例启发诱导，多表扬，少批评。开始时，孩子们都不爱洗脸，一洗就哭，只有王惠巧最干净，于是她们就表扬惠巧，叫小朋友们向她学习。当最不爱洗脸的崔隋发也肯洗脸时，马上也表扬了他。又有意识地教孩子们唱：“小花猫来吃饭，吃完饭，洗洗脸，洗干净人喜欢，洗不干净人讨厌”。就这样，孩子们都愿洗脸洗手了。七岁的崔秋增是全村最出名的“小调皮”，打人骂人，谁也管不住。一听说他要入幼儿队，村里别的孩子的母亲都不同意，怕自己孩子受气。果然，崔秋增刚来幼儿园不到一天功夫，就打哭了三、四个小朋友。有一次又和别人打起来了，他自己也挨了打。崔香琴把他叫到一边问他打的疼不疼。他说：“疼！”崔香琴又问他“那你打别人，别人疼不疼呢？”崔秋增不说话了。她又叫他领着小朋友们玩，使他先管住自己。这样崔秋增逐渐转变好了。为了配合家长更好的进行教育，她们一有空就到孩子们的家里去串门，了解孩子们的情况。使孩子们不但在幼儿队里听话、爱劳动，回到家也听大人的话、主动帮助妈妈干活。发现有的孩子说谎话，就耐心进行教育，使小朋友们知道说谎的坏处。
    实现人民公社化不久，幼儿园又增加全托业务。她和村妇联主任、教养员们兴奋地连续苦战几昼夜，修房、刷墙，为孩子们准备床铺。幼儿园发展了，教养员也增多了。新来的教养员开头情绪还高，可是没几天，嫌脏、怕累的思想都来了。有的说看孩子太腻歪，不如下地生产来的痛快，想不干了。有的见孩子流鼻涕就不耐烦地说：“给你点纸自己擦擦”。有时孩子自己溜回家了也不知道，反埋怨孩子不好带。她就组织大家讨论、找原因。经过反复讨论，大家都承认是因自己未尽到责任。她把党教育自己的话，以及本身的体会介绍给她们。告诉她们培养共产主义新人的重要，又用幼儿队由小到大，步步发展的远景来鼓励她们。现在她们都干劲十足，工作中都是争先干，钻研业务的热情也很高。孩子们的每一点进步都使她们感到极大的愉快。她们几个人凑到一起时常说：“只要需要，我们一辈子也不离开孩子们”。
