Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 18th: The farm machinery plants and 223 farm tool repair stations in the seventeen communes of Hengshan County, Hunan Province, are busily manufacturing farm tools to meet the needs of current agricultural production. In the past month, they have manufactured more than 300,000 small farm tools such as hoes, harrow teeth, and plowshares. At the same time, they have also produced more than 30,000 pieces of daily necessities such as pots and fire tongs for commune canteens and members' families. The small farm tools produced have generally improved work efficiency and saved labor.

The mass production of small farm tools in Hengshan County is being carried out under the leadership of the Hengshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The County Committee pointed out to the Party Committees of each commune that the direction of the farm machinery plants is to serve current agricultural production, and the central task is to manufacture various farm tools and daily necessities to meet the needs of production and life. The Party Committees of each commune then led the staff and workers of the farm machinery plants in展开辩论, making it clear to everyone that serving agricultural production and commune members is the fundamental policy of the commune farm machinery plants, thus creating a surge in the production of small farm tools.

In order to meet the needs of commune members for various farm tools on the spot and reduce the round-trip time for commune members to the factories, each commune's farm machinery plant specifically transferred half of its 6,780 workers to strengthen the 223 brigade farm tool repair stations, or to establish temporary repair stations at reservoir construction sites. After sending more than 100 workers to establish repair stations at reservoirs or brigades, the Shachuan Farm Machinery Plant has manufactured more than 10,000 farm tools, and more than 1,000 vehicles such as ox-drawn carts, earth trains, and three-wheeled flatbed carts. These tools made on-site are convenient, practical, and highly efficient, saving more than 7,000 labor forces every day, and are very popular among commune members.

In terms of solving the raw material problem, Hengshan County, on the one hand, allocated more than 700 tons of native steel left over from external調撥 to various communes, solving the steel problem; on the other hand, it mobilized commune members to clean up and repair damaged farm tools, or to find scrap iron and steel to make new farm tools. The eleventh team of the Pearl Brigade of the Xintang Commune found scrap iron and made hoes. Many farm machinery plants also used native iron sand to cast plowshares, plow coulters, and so on. The problem of wood was also solved by relying on the masses to obtain materials locally.

The farm machinery plants and farm tool repair stations have also produced more than 30,000 pieces of daily necessities such as pots, fire tongs, spatulas, and stove bars to supply commune members.

    衡山农械厂和修配站为春季生产作准备
    制成小农具三十多万件
    同时生产大量生活用具供应社员需要
    据新华社长沙18日电　湖南衡山县十七个公社的农械厂和二百二十三个农具修配站正在大造农具，满足当前农业生产的需要。在最近一个月来，他们已经制造了锄头、耙头、犁头等小农具三十多万件。同时还为公社食堂和社员家庭生产了锅子、火钳等生活小用具三万多件。所生产的小农具都普遍地提高了工效，节省了劳力。
    衡山县大量地生产小农具，是在中共衡山县委领导下进行的。县委曾向各公社党委指出：农械厂的方向是为当前农业生产服务，中心任务是大造各种农具和生活用具，满足生产生活需要。各公社党委又领导农械厂厂职工展开辩论，使大家明确了为农业生产和社员服务是公社农械厂的根本方针，从而掀起了生产小农具的热潮。
    各公社的农械厂为了就地满足社员对多种农具的需要，减少社员来厂的往返时间，特别从六千七百八十个工人中抽调了一半人力，充实二百二十三个大队的农具修配站，或在水库工地建立临时修造站。砂泉农械厂派出一百多工人，分别到水库或大队建立修造站后，共已造出农具一万多件，牛拉车、土火车、三轮板车等车子一千多部。这些在现场造出来的工具，方便适用，工效很高，每天可节省七千多个劳动力，很受社员欢迎。
    在解决原材料问题方面，衡山县一方面将外调后余下的七百多吨土钢拨给各公社，解决了钢材问题；另一方面发动社员把用坏了的农具清理出来进行修制，或把废钢铁找出来制成新农具。新塘公社珍珠大队十一小队有一百多个社员找出了废铁，打成了锄头。许多农械厂还用土铁翻砂制成犁头、犁壁等。木材问题也依靠群众就地取材，得到了解决。
    各农械厂和农具修配站还生产了锅、火钳、锅铲、炉条等生活用具三万多件，供应了社员。
