Xinhua News Agency, 20th – Lázaro Cárdenas, former President of Mexico and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, arrived in Beijing by plane at noon today from Moscow at the invitation of Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, for a visit to China.

Accompanying General Cárdenas on his visit to China were: Professor Alejandro Carrillo of the University of Mexico, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, General Cárdenas's son and a civil engineer, and César Buenrostro, a civil engineer.

The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at the Capital Airport by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Vice-Chairman Liao Chengzhi, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and more than 40 well-known figures from all walks of life, including Mao Dun, Li Dequan, and Chu Tunan. Latin American peace activists in Beijing also went to the airport to welcome them. Young women from the capital presented the distinguished guests with flowers.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th – Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Mexican friends headed by General Cárdenas, former President of Mexico and Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council.

Guo Moruo spoke at the banquet, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people to the Mexican friends visiting China.

Guo Moruo said that General Cárdenas has made great contributions to the cause of maintaining peace. This visit to China brings the profound friendship of the great Mexican people to the Chinese people, which is a great encouragement to us.

Guo Moruo said that although Mexico and China are far apart, the people of both countries love peace. We firmly believe that not only are the people of our two countries willing to coexist peacefully, but also the people of all countries in the world are willing to coexist peacefully.

Guo Moruo said that to realize the desire of the people of all countries in the world to coexist peacefully, it is worthy of our joint efforts to promote mutual understanding and contact between countries. We hope that General Cárdenas will visit China more than once in the future, and we hope that more Mexican friends will come to China to visit in the future. We are willing to greet Mexican friends with continuous efforts and more achievements, and are willing to work together with the Mexican people and the people of the world for the cause of world peace.

Guo Moruo hoped that Mexican friends would offer valuable suggestions on our country's construction cause during their visit. Guo Moruo finally proposed a toast to the friendship between China and Mexico and to world peace.

General Cárdenas expressed his deep emotion and gratitude for the invitation from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to visit China. He said that we had wanted to visit your country a long time ago, and today this wish has come true.

General Cárdenas said that we feel that the Chinese revolution is like our own, and we have been concerned about your revolution for many years.

General Cárdenas spoke in detail about the situation of Mexico's national democratic revolutionary struggle since 1910. He said that a dictatorial oligarchy had ruled Mexico for many years, and the people lived in poverty. Therefore, the Mexican workers took up arms to overthrow the political oligarchy, promulgated a constitution in 1917, and carried out land reform and other social reforms. However, the rich and powerful hindered the development of this revolution. Today, Mexican peasants still have no land, and there is still unemployment in the cities. The Mexican workers and the younger generation hope to carry out reforms to make our country permanently free from poverty.

General Cárdenas said that our workers must unite! Like the Chinese people. Only by uniting can we protect our own interests, can we achieve peace at home, and thus can we better defend world peace.

General Cárdenas finally said that I believe that the Chinese people will certainly be able to achieve their goals. Under the leadership of honest and selfless leaders, they will surely achieve their achievements in political, economic and moral aspects.

Among those present at the banquet were Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and well-known figures from all walks of life such as Mao Dun, Shao Lizi, Li Zhuchen, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Chu Tunan, Liu Changsheng, Nan Hanchen, Feng Zhongyun, Zhang Zhixiang, Wu Youxun, Wu Han, Qiao Guanhua, Qian Xuesen, Meng Yongqian, Zhang Zhirang, Liang Sicheng, Lu Ping, and Lao She, totaling more than 50 people.

    新华社20日讯　墨西哥前总统、世界和平理事会副主席拉萨罗·卡德纳斯将军，应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若的邀请访问中国，从莫斯科乘飞机在今天中午到达北京。
    随同卡德纳斯将军访问中国的有：墨西哥大学教授亚历山德罗·卡里略，卡德纳斯将军的儿子、土木工程师库奥特莫克·卡德纳斯，土木工程师塞萨尔·布恩罗斯特罗。
    贵宾们在首都机场上受到了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席廖承志，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通，以及社会各界著名人士茅盾、李德全、楚图南等四十多人的热烈欢迎。在北京的拉丁美洲和平人士也到机场欢迎。首都女青年向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    新华社20日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若，今晚举行宴会欢迎以墨西哥前总统、世界和平理事会副主席卡德纳斯将军为首的墨西哥朋友们。
    郭沫若在宴会上讲话，他代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民热烈欢迎墨西哥朋友访问中国。
    郭沫若说，卡德纳斯将军对维护和平事业作出了很大贡献。这次访问中国，他带来了伟大的墨西哥人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，这对我们是很大的鼓舞。
    郭沫若说，墨西哥和中国虽然相距遥远，但是两国人民都是爱好和平的。我们深深相信，不仅我们两国人民愿意和平共处，而且全世界各国人民都愿意能够和平共处。
    郭沫若说，要实现世界各国人民和平共处的愿望，在促进各国相互了解相互接触方面是值得我们共同努力的。我们希望卡德纳斯将军今后不只一次地到中国来访问，并且希望今后有更多的墨西哥朋友到中国来访问。我们愿意以不断的努力和更多的成就来迎接墨西哥朋友，愿意同墨西哥人民和全世界人民一道，为世界和平事业而奋斗。
    郭沫若希望墨西哥朋友在参观过程中，对我国的建设事业多提宝贵意见。郭沫若最后提议为中国和墨西哥的友谊和世界和平干杯。
    卡德纳斯将军在讲话中对中国人民保卫世界和平委员会邀请他们访问中国，表示非常感动和感谢。他说，很早我们就想到你们的国家来访问，今天这个愿望实现了。
    卡德纳斯将军说，我们感到中国的革命就像我们自己的事情一样，多少年以来我们一直关心你们的革命。
    卡德纳斯将军详细谈到了1910年以来墨西哥进行民族民主革命斗争的情况。他说，独裁寡头在墨西哥统治了多少年，人民生活贫困。所以墨西哥劳动者拿起了武器打倒了政治寡头，在1917年颁布了宪法，进行土地改革和其他社会改革。但是，有钱有势的人阻碍了这次革命的发展。现在，墨西哥农民还是没有土地，城市还有失业。墨西哥的劳动者和青年一代希望进行改革，使我们的国家永远脱离贫困。
    卡德纳斯将军说，我国的劳动者必须团结起来！就像中国人民那样的。只有团结起来，才能保护自己的利益，才能在国内取得和平，从而才能更好地保卫世界和平。
    卡德纳斯将军最后说，我相信中国人民一定能够达到自己的目的。他们在正直无私的领导者的领导下，一定会在政治、经济和道德各方面取得自己的成就。
    出席这次宴会的，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，社会各界著名人士茅盾、邵力子、李烛尘、史良、李德全、楚图南、刘长胜、南汉宸、冯仲云、张致祥、吴有训、吴晗、乔冠华、钱学森、孟用潜、张志让、梁思成、陆平、老舍等共五十多人。（附图片）
