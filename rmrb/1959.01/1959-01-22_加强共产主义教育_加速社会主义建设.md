Strengthen Communist Education, Accelerate Socialist Construction
Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Strengthening Communist Education for the Future is a Pressing Task

The achievements of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, and the victory of the people's communes, greatly accelerated the speed of socialist construction in our country, rapidly introducing some communist factors, and creating the best form for the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in our rural areas, and for our country's future transition from socialist to communist society. The majority of people have expressed joy and encouragement at this rapidly developing situation, and are working tirelessly to run the communes well, to organize a new Great Leap Forward, to accelerate socialist construction, and to prepare conditions for the transition to communism. But there are indeed many people who do not sufficiently understand this rapidly developing situation: some do not understand the great historical significance of realizing the people's communes; some lack the thought of continuous revolution, believing that there is a Great Wall of China between socialism and communism, and do not see the inevitability of the emergence and growth of communist factors; and some, because they are bound by bourgeois legal ideology, believe that the growth of communist factors is an abnormal phenomenon, and are filled with anxiety; some even attack these communist factors that have already emerged with bourgeois legal ideology. If we do not carry out socialist and communist education, and criticize these erroneous ideas, we will not be able to promote the smooth advance of the revolutionary cause. At the same time, some comrades, in the face of great victory, due to insufficient understanding of the nature of the people's communes, and of the interrelationship and essential differences between the two different stages of socialism and communism, have confused the two different stages of socialist and communist development, attempting to quickly transform collective ownership into ownership by the whole people, and attempting to prematurely negate the principle of distribution according to labor. Therefore, arming the broad masses of Party members, cadres and the masses with scientific communist ideology has become an extremely urgent task.

Communism is the highest revolutionary program of our Party, it is the scientific ideological system of the proletarian revolution, and guidance by communist ideology is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our revolution. In the past, under the guidance of this ideology, we victoriously carried out the democratic revolution, and victoriously carried out the socialist revolutionary transformation; now we will also build socialism victoriously under the guidance of this ideology, and in the future victoriously realize the transition to communism. Without the guidance of communist ideology, we cannot correctly and victoriously carry out socialist construction. Practice has proven that the higher the communist ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses, the more effective our revolutionary and construction work will be.

At present, we not only need to use the communist ideological system to educate cadres in order to correctly guide the current socialist construction, but also need to prepare material and spiritual conditions for the realization of the communist social system. Our current task is still to accelerate the construction of socialism, but socialism is the lower stage of communism, and socialist construction must take the realization of communism as its goal; and in the process of socialist construction, some communist factors will inevitably arise. We should complete the preparations for the transition to communism in the process of building socialism. Therefore, any underestimation of the significance of carrying out communist ideological education at present is wrong.

Correctly Understand the Differences and Connections Between Socialism and Communism

To carry out communist education, we must correctly link and distinguish between the propaganda of the communist ideological system and the practice of the action program for building socialism. The current socialist and communist education movement must be closely combined with the realistic tasks of rectifying the people's communes and organizing a new Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

First, it is necessary to closely combine the transmission of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee on several issues concerning the people's communes, with the education of Marxist-Leninist scientific theories on building socialism and transitioning to communism, and arm Party members, cadres, and the masses with Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of unifying the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development. We are continuous revolutionaries, and we believe that the transition from socialism to communism is the inevitable trend of social development. In the process of building socialism, communist factors will gradually increase, laying the foundation for the transition to communism in terms of material and spiritual conditions. In the previous stage of the revolution, we must prepare for the next stage of the revolution, and there should not be a Great Wall of China between socialism and communism, which would cause socialism to stagnate and push communism into the distant future. At the same time, we are theorists of the stages of revolutionary development, and we acknowledge that socialism and communism are two different stages of social development, which have qualitative differences. The transition from socialism to communism must have certain conditions and must be based on the full development of productive forces. This is what the resolution of the Central Political Bureau on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas in August 1958 pointed out: it is necessary that social products be extremely abundant; the communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of the entire people are greatly improved; universal education is popularized and improved; the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and physical labor, which socialism still has to preserve from the old society, gradually disappear, and the remnants of unequal bourgeois rights reflecting these differences also gradually disappear; the function of the state is only to deal with external aggression and no longer functions internally; only at this time can our society enter the communist era of each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. At present, our level of productive forces is still very low, and there is still a considerable distance from the goals of national industrialization, national agricultural mechanization, and electrification, and an even longer distance from the goals mentioned earlier. Therefore, we should not confuse the two different stages of socialist and communist development, lower communist standards, and inappropriately expand communist factors. It is true that the transformation from agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes has expanded and improved the original collective ownership, and has some elements of ownership by the whole people. But this does not mean that the collective ownership in the countryside has been transformed into socialist ownership by the whole people. It is true that the establishment of the people's communes has created the best form for the transition from socialism to communism, and the grain supply system implemented by the people's communes has the seeds of communist distribution according to need, but this does not mean that it has already changed from socialism to communism; even after the conditions are ripe, the transition from socialist collective ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people does not mean that it has changed from socialism to communism. We must correctly understand the current situation of socialist construction, both to boost revolutionary drive, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, make full use of the favorable situation of realizing the people's communes, accelerate socialist construction, and cherish and support the growth of communist factors in the process of construction, actively preparing conditions for the transition to communism; but also to have a calm and scientific mind, use the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to analyze China's political and economic situation, correctly understand the nature of the people's communes, act in accordance with the laws of social development, and correctly implement the policies and guidelines determined by the Central Committee, so as to ensure the consolidated development of the people's communes and the victorious progress of socialist construction.

Continue to Carry Out the Ideological Struggle of Destroying Capitalism and Establishing Socialism

Second, continue to deeply carry out the ideological struggle of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism. The struggle of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" on the ideological front needs to be carried out repeatedly throughout the transition period. Any view that neglects this struggle and believes that the struggle between the two roads has been completely resolved is wrong. It is true that after the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, we have achieved a decisive victory in the struggle between the two roads. However, such a profound social change as the communization of the people cannot but cause new political and ideological struggles. In fact, the "wait-and-see" faction and the "account-settling" faction are still waiting for an opportunity to raise their heads, and they are still trying to deny the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the superiority of the people's communes. It seems that a major debate must be conducted around the work of the Great Leap Forward and the rectification of communes, and through debate, improve thinking, unify understanding, and clarify the direction of progress.

In addition, it is necessary to carry out collectivist education, oppose individualism and departmentalism, and establish the correct relationship between the individual and the collective, and the part and the whole. On the one hand, educate the commune members to recognize that individual interests must be based on collective interests, that cooperation has brought us a leap in production and improved living standards, and that the people's communes will unfold a brighter and greater future for us. Every commune member must love the people's communes, care about the development of collective interests, cherish public property, and oppose erroneous behaviors such as only caring about individual interests and not collective interests, only caring about local interests and not overall interests, concealing production for private distribution, and corruption and waste. On the other hand, protect the legitimate interests of the masses and be extremely concerned about their personal requirements. Adhere to the principle of large collectives and small freedoms, and correctly implement the Party's various policies.

Continuously Break Down Bourgeois Rights Ideology, Treat the Principle of Distribution According to Labor Historically

Third, continuously break down bourgeois rights ideology. Because some remnants of bourgeois rights must be broken down, and some cannot be broken down now, but should be broken down appropriately in the future when conditions are available and necessary, in order to adapt to the development of productive forces; therefore, it is necessary to carry out education to break down bourgeois rights ideology. Facts have proven that breaking down bourgeois rights ideology has played a great role in raising the socialist and communist consciousness of cadres and the masses and promoting the development of production. After rectification, a major cleanup was carried out on some remnants of bourgeois rights (such as being full of official airs, being condescending, being divorced from the masses, not treating people with an equal spirit, and not appearing as ordinary laborers), and the result was a great improvement in the relationship between leaders and the masses, boosting the revolutionary drive of cadres and the masses, and setting off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production. In the struggle to improve the masses' consciousness and the Great Leap Forward in production, the masses also carried forward the communist attitude towards labor and broke through the principle of distribution according to labor. The masses' spirit of automatically breaking through labor quotas, disregarding remuneration, and implementing communist large-scale cooperation greatly promoted production. The rural areas have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, and have implemented a grain supply system, which has provided a basic guarantee for the lives of the broad masses. This is of great significance for encouraging the production enthusiasm of the broad masses and enabling them to carry out labor production without any worries. In the future, this communist spirit should continue to be carried forward, breaking the shackles of bourgeois rights ideology and overcoming the mercenary view of calculating personal interests. However, under the current conditions that the level of production development is not high, products are not extremely abundant, and the level of consciousness of the masses is not high enough, we must still adhere to the principle of distribution according to labor, and only those who labor more and labor well should be distributed more, and egalitarianism is wrong. Therefore, the supply system portion cannot be expanded indefinitely at present, and the wage portion should be increased to some extent with the development of production, and a certain wage difference should be maintained. We must educate the masses to treat the principle of distribution according to labor from a historical and developmental perspective. We must affirm that it still has the inevitability and necessity of existence under the current historical conditions, and cannot be easily negated; but we must also point out from a developmental perspective that it is not a sacred and inviolable fixed principle, that it still has irrationality, and that it will be replaced by the communist principle of distribution according to need in the future.

Continue to Carry Forward the Communist Style of Daring to Think and Act, Striving for a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward

Fourth, in order to run the communes well and organize a new Great Leap Forward, it is necessary to continue to emphasize emancipating the mind, breaking superstitions, and carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. The Great Leap Forward in production in 1958 vividly illustrated the importance of carrying forward the communist style. If people's minds are bound by outdated experiences and old concepts, and they do not dare to boldly explore the possibilities that have not yet been discovered, we cannot achieve the victory of the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958. Therefore, we must fully estimate the great achievements we have made in 1958, sum up the rich experiences we have gained, widely publicize these achievements and experiences, and continue to emphasize breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and continuing to carry forward the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, in order to encourage the revolutionary drive of the broad masses of the people, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year than in 1958.

People are the decisive factor in the development of productive forces. The full play of people's subjective initiative is a huge driving force for production. However, emancipating the mind, breaking superstitions, and daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act are consistent with the scientific and realistic attitude. Superstition and science are antagonistic, and truly breaking superstitions means truly respecting science. Only by building daring to think and daring to act on the basis of science, that is, on the basis of careful investigation and research, discovering and applying objective laws, can our various tasks achieve greater achievements. We oppose the theory of only conditions, but we must carefully study conditions, understand conditions, change conditions, and create new conditions, and further understand the laws of objective development from them, and turn possibilities into reality. To give greater play to people's subjective initiative, it is necessary to deeply study objective laws and master them to benefit mankind. Similarly, we say that we must seek truth from facts and follow objective laws, which certainly does not mean being a slave to objective laws and not daring to give play to people's subjective initiative. Therefore, we must correctly understand the relationship between daring to think and dare to act and seeking truth from facts, and combine high enthusiasm with the scientific spirit, so that the leap forward plan is practical and reliable, and continue to criticize all kinds of new right-leaning conservative thoughts in the organization of the new leap forward. And it must be affirmed that for a revolutionary who is building socialism, abundant revolutionary enthusiasm and the creative spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act are the most fundamental things, and are the great driving force for the Great Leap Forward in our cause. The mastery of objective laws and the scientific analysis that we advocate are only meaningful for the victorious revolutionary struggle to transform the objective world. Otherwise, what force can encourage us to understand objective laws and conduct scientific analysis, and what can we do if we understand objective laws and conduct scientific analysis?

Deeply Carry Out Education on the Mass Line

Fifth, continue to deeply carry out education on the mass viewpoint and the mass line. After the rectification movement, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. Many cadres have appeared as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and laboring with the masses. The working methods of the mass line have been newly developed, which has enabled various tasks to achieve great achievements. These successful experiences must continue to be carried forward. The thoughts and styles of work that violate the mass line, which have arisen in a small number of cadres in the great victory of the Great Leap Forward, should be patiently persuaded and educated, and resolutely corrected. Through the development of the socialist and communist education movement, a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, and has both unified will and personal ease of mind and liveliness, must be truly established.

In 1958, we held high the red flag and achieved great victory. On the basis of this great victory, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, based on the experience of combining Marxist-Leninist theory with the practice of Chinese revolution and construction, has planned for us a brilliant road to victoriously build socialism and transition to communism in the future. We must hold the red flag of communist ideology even higher, correctly implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, effectively run the people's communes, organize a new Great Leap Forward, and strive to accelerate socialist construction and actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism.

    加强共产主义教育　加速社会主义建设
    中共河北省委书记处书记　张承先
    加强共产主义前途教育是当前的迫切任务
    1958年工农业生产大跃进所取得的成就，人民公社化的胜利，大大加快了我国社会主义建设的速度，迅速出现了一些共产主义因素，并为我国农村由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，为我国将来由社会主义过渡到共产主义社会，创造了最好的形式。多数人对这种迅速发展的形势表示欢欣鼓舞，都在为办好公社、为组织新的大跃进、为加速社会主义建设并为过渡到共产主义准备条件而奋斗不懈。但确实也有不少人对这种迅速发展的形势认识不足：有些人不了解实现人民公社化的伟大历史意义；有些人缺乏不断革命的思想，认为社会主义与共产主义之间存在着一道万里长城，看不到共产主义因素的出现与增长的必然性；甚至有些人因为受到资产阶级法权思想的束缚，认为共产主义因素的增长是不正常的现象，忧心忡忡；有些人竟以资产阶级法权思想，攻击这些已经出现的共产主义因素。如果不进行社会主义、共产主义教育，对这些错误思想进行批判，就不能推动革命事业顺利前进。同时，也有一些同志在巨大胜利面前，由于对人民公社的性质，对社会主义与共产主义两个不同阶段的互相联系及其本质的区别，认识不够清楚，因而混淆了社会主义与共产主义两个不同发展阶段，企图很快把集体所有制转变成全民所有制，企图过早否定按劳分配原则。因此，用科学的共产主义思想武装广大党员、干部与群众，已成为十分迫切的任务。
    共产主义是我们党的最高革命纲领，是无产阶级的革命的科学的思想体系，以共产主义思想为指导是我们革命取得胜利的根本保证。过去在这一思想指导下，我们胜利地进行了民主革命，并且胜利地进行了社会主义的革命转变；现在也将在这一思想指导下，胜利建设社会主义，并在将来胜利地实现向共产主义过渡。离开共产主义思想的指导，我们就不能正确地胜利地进行社会主义建设。实践证明，干部群众的共产主义思想觉悟愈高，我们的革命与建设工作就愈有成效。
    目前我们不只需要用共产主义思想体系教育干部，以正确的指导当前的社会主义建设，而且还需要为实现共产主义社会制度准备物质的与精神的条件。我们现阶段的任务还是加速建设社会主义，但是社会主义是共产主义的低级阶段，社会主义建设必须以实现共产主义为目标；而在社会主义建设过程中不可免的要产生一些共产主义因素。我们应当在建设社会主义过程中完成向共产主义过渡的准备。因此，任何低估目前进行共产主义思想教育的意义都是错误的。
    正确认识社会主义同共产主义的区别与联系
    进行共产主义教育，必须把对于共产主义思想体系的宣传同对于建设社会主义的行动纲领的实践这两个方面正确地加以联系与区别。目前的社会主义、共产主义教育运动，必须与整顿人民公社、组织新的社会主义建设大跃进这些现实任务紧密结合起来。
    首先，要紧密结合八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议的传达，进行马克思列宁主义关于建成社会主义与过渡到共产主义的科学理论的教育，用毛泽东同志关于不断革命论与革命发展阶段论相统一的思想武装党员干部和群众。我们是不断革命论者，我们认为由社会主义过渡到共产主义是社会发展的必然趋势，在建设社会主义过程中，共产主义因素将逐步增长，将在物质条件与精神条件方面为过渡到共产主义奠定基础，在革命的前一阶段即必须为过渡到革命的下一阶段做好准备，不应在社会主义与共产主义之间隔上一道万里长城，而使社会主义停止不前，把共产主义推向遥远的将来。同时，我们又是革命发展的阶段论者，我们承认社会主义与共产主义是两个不同的社会发展阶段，其中存在着质的区别，由社会主义过渡到共产主义必须有一定的条件，必须以生产力的充分发展为基础。这就是1958年8月中央政治局关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中所指出的：必须要社会产品极大地丰富了；全体人民的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了；社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别逐渐消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权残余也逐步地消失了；国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了；只有在这种时候，我国社会才能进入各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义时代。而目前我们生产力的发展水平还很低，离全国工业化、全国农业机械化、电气化的目标还有一段不小的距离，离开前边所说的目标还有一段更长的距离。因此不应混淆社会主义与共产主义两个不同的发展阶段，降低共产主义标准，不适当地扩大共产主义因素。不错，由农业生产合作社变成人民公社，使原有的集体所有制扩大了提高了，并且带上了若干全民所有制的成分。但是这并不等于已经把农村中的集体所有制变为社会主义的全民所有制了。不错，人民公社的建立为社会主义过渡到共产主义创造了最好的形式，人民公社实行的粮食供给制带有共产主义按需分配的萌芽，但这并不等于已经由社会主义变成了共产主义；即便条件成熟后，由社会主义集体所有制变为社会主义全民所有制，那时也不等于由社会主义变成共产主义。我们必须正确认识目前社会主义建设的形势，既要鼓足革命干劲，发扬不断革命精神，充分利用实现公社化的有利形势，加速社会主义建设，并在建设过程中爱护与扶植共产主义因素的增长，积极为过渡到共产主义准备条件；又要具备冷静的科学的头脑，用辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的立场观点方法来分析我国的政治经济的现状，正确认识人民公社的性质，按照社会发展规律办事，正确地执行中央确定的方针政策，以保证人民公社巩固地发展与社会主义建设胜利的进行。
    继续进行破资本主义、立社会主义的思想斗争
    第二，继续深入进行破资本主义、立社会主义的思想斗争。思想战线上“兴无灭资”的斗争，在整个过渡时期需要反复进行。任何忽视这个斗争，认为两条道路的斗争已经完全解决了的观点都是错误的。诚然，经过经济战线、政治思想战线上的社会主义革命，我们在两条道路的斗争中已经取得了决定性的胜利。但人民公社化这样一次深刻的社会变革，不可能不引起新的政治思想斗争，事实上，观潮派、算账派还在伺机抬头，他们还企图否定大跃进的成就，否定人民公社的优越性。看来围绕着大跃进与整顿公社的工作，还必须进行一场大辩论，通过辩论，提高思想，统一认识，明确前进的方向。
    此外，要进行集体主义教育，反对个人主义与本位主义，树立个人与集体，局部与整体的正确关系。一方面教育社员认识个人利益必须建立在集体利益的基础上，合作化给我们带来生产的跃进与生活的改善，人民公社将给我们展开一个更加光明伟大的前景，每个社员必须要热爱人民公社，关心集体利益的发展，爱护公共财产，反对那种只顾个人利益不顾集体利益、只顾局部利益不顾整体利益、瞒产私分、贪污浪费等错误行为。另方面要保护群众的正当利益，极大地关心他们的切身要求。坚持执行大集体小自由的原则，正确贯彻党的各项政策。
    不断破除资产阶级法权思想，历史地对待按劳分配原则
    第三，不断地破除资产阶级法权思想。由于有一部分资产阶级法权残余必须破除，有一部分现在还不能破除，但在将来有条件有必要的情况下也应适时的破除它，以适应生产力的发展；所以进行破除资产阶级法权思想的教育是必要的。事实证明，破除资产阶级法权思想对提高干部和群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，推动生产的发展，起了很大作用。经过整风，对一部分资产阶级法权残余来了一个大扫除（如官气十足，居高临下，脱离群众，不以平等精神待人，不以普通劳动者姿态出现等），这样做的结果大大改善了领导与群众的关系，鼓起了干部与群众的革命干劲，掀起了生产大跃进的高潮。在群众觉悟提高与生产大跃进的斗争中，群众也曾发扬了共产主义的劳动态度，突破了按劳分配的原则。群众那种自动突破劳动定额，不计报酬，实行共产主义大协作的精神，大大推动了生产。农村实行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，实行了粮食供给制，使广大群众生活得到了基本保证。这对鼓舞广大群众生产积极性，使他们无所顾虑的进行劳动生产有重大意义。今后仍应发扬这种共产主义精神，打破资产阶级法权思想的束缚，克服斤斤计较个人利益的雇佣观点。但是，在目前生产发展水平还不高，产品还没有极大丰富，而群众的觉悟水平还不够高的条件下，还必须坚持按劳分配原则，只能是劳动得多的劳动得好的多分配一些，平均主义是不对的。因此，目前供给制部分不能无限制地扩大，工资部分要随着生产发展有所提高，而且要保持若干工资差别。我们要教育群众用历史的发展的观点来对待按劳分配的原则。要肯定它在目前的历史条件下还有存在的必然性和必要性，不能轻易否定；又要以发展的观点指出它不是一个神圣不可侵犯的固定不移的原则，它还存在不合理性，它在将来要被共产主义按需分配的原则所代替。
    继续发扬敢想敢干的共产主义风格，争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进
    第四，为了办好公社、组织新的大跃进，需要继续强调解放思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格。1958年的生产大跃进，生动的说明了发扬共产主义风格的重要性。如果人们的思想被过时的经验和旧观念束缚着，不敢大胆地探索尚未被人发现的可能性，我们就不能取得1958年生产大跃进的胜利。因此，必须充分估计我们在1958年所取得的伟大成就，很好地总结我们所取得的丰富经验，广泛地宣传这些成就和经验，并继续强调破除迷信，解放思想，继续发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，以鼓舞广大人民群众的革命干劲，在今年争取实现比1958年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    人是生产力发展决定性的因素。人的主观能动性的充分发挥，对生产是个巨大动力。但解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢干，与科学的实事求是的态度是一致的。迷信与科学是敌对的，真正破除了迷信，也就是真正的尊重了科学。只有把敢想敢干建筑在科学的基础上，也就是建筑在认真调查研究、发现与运用客观规律的基础上，我们的各项工作才能取得更大的成就。我们反对唯条件论，但是要认真研究条件，认识条件，改变条件，并创造新的条件，从中进一步认识客观发展的规律，把可能变成现实。要想更大的发挥人的主观能动性，就要深入地研究客观规律，掌握它来为人类造福。同样，我们说要实事求是，要遵循客观规律办事情，这也绝不是意味着要做客观规律的奴隶，而不敢发挥人的主观能动性。因此，必须正确理解敢想敢干与实事求是的关系，把高度热情与科学精神结合起来，使跃进计划切实可靠，并在组织新的跃进中继续批判各式各样的新的右倾保守思想。而且必须肯定，对一个建设社会主义的革命者来说，充沛的革命热情，敢想、敢说、敢干的创造精神，是最根本的东西，是我们事业大跃进的伟大动力。我们提倡的掌握客观规律，进行科学分析，也只有为了胜利地进行改造客观世界的革命斗争才有意义，否则，还有什么力量能够鼓舞我们来认识客观规律进行科学分析，认识了客观规律，进行了科学分析又能有什么作为呢？
    深入进行群众路线的教育
    第五，要继续深入进行群众观点与群众路线的教育。经过整风运动，干部与群众的关系有了极大改善，许多干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现，与群众同吃同住同劳动，群众路线的工作方法有了新的发展，因而使各项工作取得了巨大成就。对于这些成功的经验，必须继续发扬。对于在大跃进的伟大胜利中，在少数干部中所产生的违反群众路线的思想作风，应该耐心地进行说服教育，坚决加以纠正。经过社会主义、共产主义教育运动的开展，要使既有集中又有民主、既要纪律又有自由、既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面确实建立起来。
    1958年我们高举红旗取得了巨大的胜利。在这一伟大胜利的基础上，八届六中全会又根据马克思列宁主义理论结合中国革命建设实践的经验，给我们规划了一条胜利地建成社会主义与在将来过渡到共产主义的光辉道路。我们必须把共产主义思想的红旗举得更高，正确贯彻八届六中全会决议，切实办好人民公社，组织新的大跃进，为加速社会主义建设并为过渡到共产主义积极准备条件而奋斗。
