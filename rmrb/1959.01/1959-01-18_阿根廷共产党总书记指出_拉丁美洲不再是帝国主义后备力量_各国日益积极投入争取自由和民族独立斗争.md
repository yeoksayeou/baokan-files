Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th. According to TASS, Buenos Aires, 15th: The Argentine newspaper "El Tiempo Argentino" published on the 15th a report by Rodolfo Ghioldi, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party, at an enlarged meeting of the Party Central Committee on the international and domestic situation.

　　In his report, Ghioldi emphasized that the people of colonies and dependent countries are currently intensifying their struggle for independence. The forces of peace and democracy have strengthened, while the economic crisis in capitalist countries, particularly the United States, has sharpened, and military madness has intensified. Therefore, there is no doubt that in this historically significant struggle, the camp of peace and socialism will defeat the camp of imperialism and war.

　　Ghioldi pointed out that the outstanding achievement of the Soviet Union in launching a cosmic rocket is a guarantee of victory for the socialist countries, "This is the achievement of our century." Ghioldi also spoke in detail about the significance of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy. He said, "Facts show that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system," and the speed of economic and cultural development in the Soviet Union far exceeds that of the United States. Ghioldi then emphasized that "the main and decisive task now is to prevent the war being prepared by U.S. imperialism and to struggle to safeguard peace."

　　Speaking about the situation in Latin America, Ghioldi pointed out that Latin American countries are no longer "an imperialist reserve force." They are increasingly actively engaged in the general struggle of colonies and dependent countries for freedom and national independence. Ghioldi pointed out that the events in Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay, as well as the recent victory of the Cuban people against the dictator, all prove this.

　　The reporter then spoke in detail about the domestic economic and financial situation. He emphasized that the recent sharp deterioration of the domestic economic situation in Argentina is largely due to the attempt by foreign monopoly capital, especially U.S. monopoly capital, to subject Argentina's economy to its own interests.

　　Ghioldi finally called on the domestic working people to strengthen the struggle, strive for the unity of the working class, and establish a national democratic front.

    阿根廷共产党总书记指出
    拉丁美洲不再是帝国主义后备力量
    各国日益积极投入争取自由和民族独立斗争
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯15日讯：阿根廷“时报”15日刊载了阿根廷共产党中央委员会总书记柯都维亚在党中央扩大会议上关于国际和国内局势的报告。
    柯都维亚在报告中强调指出，目前殖民地和附属国的人民加强了争取独立的斗争。和平民主的力量加强了，而各资本主义国家，首先是美国的经济危机尖锐化了，军事狂更加剧了。因此，现在丝毫不用怀疑，在这场有历史意义的斗争中，和平和社会主义阵营将战胜帝国主义和战争的阵营。
    柯都维亚指出，苏联发射宇宙火箭的杰出成就是社会主义国家方面取得胜利的保证，“这是我们这世纪的功绩”。柯都维亚还详细谈到苏联发展国民经济七年计划的意义。他说：“事实说明社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越得多”，苏联经济和文化发展的速度大大超过美国的发展速度。柯都维亚接着强调指出，“现在主要和决定性的任务是防止美帝国主义正在准备的战争，为维护和平而斗争”。
    谈到拉丁美洲的情况时，柯都维亚指出，拉丁美洲国家已经不再是“帝国主义的后备力量”。它们越来越积极地投入殖民地和附属国争取自由和民族独立的总的斗争中。柯都维亚指出，委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、阿根廷、智利、巴西和乌拉圭发生的事件，以及最近古巴人民反独裁者的胜利都证明了这一点。
    报告人接着详细说到国内的经济和财政情况。他强调指出，最近阿根廷国内经济情况的急剧恶化在很大程度上是由于外国垄断资本、特别是美国垄断资本企图把阿根廷的经济服从于他们自己利益的结果。
    柯都维亚最后号召国内劳动人民加强斗争，争取工人阶级的团结和建立全国民主阵线。
