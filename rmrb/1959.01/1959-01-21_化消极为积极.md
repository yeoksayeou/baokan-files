    Turning the Negative into Positive
    Duan Wenque
    The first issue of this year's "China Worker" has a column called "Everyone Becomes a Skilled Craftsman." There are six articles in total, all about workers engaging in technical revolution. Although the articles are short, they give people the feeling that workers are always so enthusiastic in their work, always so ambitious and full of heroic spirit, and always so down-to-earth, starting from small things.
    However, no ten fingers are exactly the same length, and what's more, a small number of workers today are transformed from the original "capitalists." Two articles mention these kinds of people. One is "Don't Be Afraid of a Weak Foundation, Be Afraid of a Lack of Ambition." The workers in an electric motor factory, in order to change the heavy physical labor of the winding workers in the transformer workshop, made an electric winding machine themselves, but this machine initially had problems and could not wind large transformers. They went to consult with the factory's designer, Old Li. This Old Li was originally a private businessman, but who knew he didn't take this thing to heart at all, and said coldly: "If this could be done, who would spend money to buy it!" Later, naturally, the workers improved it. Another article is "He Admitted Defeat": The workers of the Beijing Metal Processing Factory had to copy a 618 lathe in twenty days. At this time, there was an eighth-grade technician, Li Xianghe, who used to be the manager of a private factory, and he didn't believe this could be done. He said, "Based on our factory's technical conditions and equipment conditions, let alone twenty days, even a year may not be enough." The result, of course, was that the workers completed it on schedule, and this Li Xianghe "admitted defeat" in front of everyone.
    I don't know if these two Lis can be regarded as typical of this kind of person. They have certain skills and participate in socialist construction, which is good, but why can't they make their skills fully play a role when the country needs technical strength, and sometimes they become some negative factors in the technical revolution instead?
    The main reason is that they themselves have certain weaknesses. Compared with ordinary workers: they are colder in heart, higher in their sights, lazier in their hands, and ruder in their manner.
    Colder in heart. That is, they are not as enthusiastic and wholeheartedly responsive to the Party's call as ordinary workers. They are skeptical and half-hearted about the Party's call for technical revolution. They are not as anxious as ordinary workers when they see that the machinery industry can't keep up with the needs, designing solutions as if it were their own business, and they also lack that soaring drive.
    Higher in their sights. This is because they know a little technology, so they look down on the indigenous and even more despise the power of ordinary people. They are unwilling to make do with what is available, and even less believe in collective wisdom and effort. They see things but not people, always thinking of the big and foreign, with high and empty visions, out of touch with reality.
    Lazier in their hands. They want to rely on ready-made things in everything, and even when "everything is ready," they still need others to "borrow the east wind" for them. They are unwilling to start from small things and do it bit by bit; they are even more unwilling to overcome difficulties and create conditions themselves.
    Ruder in their manner. They do not know how to cherish state property, and at every turn, they want to use money to buy things. They do not understand what is meant by waste utilization, nor do they understand what is meant by labor creation.
    In general, this is still because politics has not taken command. As a result, technology, such a useful thing, in their hands sometimes turns into a blindfold that obscures thinking. They have not yet raised the red flag in their minds, their positions have not yet been completely changed, and their minds have not yet been liberated.
    However, technology is ultimately a useful thing. Technology itself does not necessarily contain negative factors. As long as they become more enthusiastic, see problems more practically, put their hands to work more diligently, and know how to cherish state resources; in a word, with politics in command, and also raise the red flag of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and technical revolution. Then, their technology will also radiate brilliance, and in this year's even greater leap forward, they will also become people who make greater contributions to the construction of the motherland.

    化消极为积极
    段文阙
    今年的第一期“中国工人”，有一栏叫“人人做能工巧匠”。共有六篇文章，都写的是工人们闹技术革命的事。文章虽短，却使人感到，工人们作事，总是那么热气腾腾的，总是那么壮志凌云、豪气冲天，又总是那么实事求是从小处着手。
    但是，十个指头不一般齐，何况现在的工人当中，还有一小部分是从原来的“资方”转化来的。有两篇文章，都提到了这种人。一篇是“不怕底子薄，就怕没志气”。一家电机厂的工人们，为了改变变压器车间绕线工人的笨重体力劳动，自己制造了一架电动绕线机，可是这台机器起初还有毛病，不能绕大的变压器。他们就去请教厂里的设计员老李。这个老李原来是一个私方人员，谁知他压根儿就没有把这玩艺放在眼里，冷冷地说：“这能成，谁还花钱买哩！”后来自然是工人们把它改进了。另一篇是“他服输了”：北京金属加工厂的工人们，要在二十天内仿造一台618车床。这时有一个八级技工李相和，他过去曾经是一个私营厂的经理，不相信这事可以办成。他说：“就凭我们厂的技术条件，设备条件，别说二十天，就是一年的时间也不一定能行。”结果自然又是工人们如期完成了，而这位李相和在大家面前“服输了”。
    这二李我不知能不能算作这种人的典型，他们具有一定的技术，参加了社会主义建设，这是好的，但是为什么正当国家需要技术力量的时候，他们却不能使他们的技术充分发挥作用，有时反而会成为技术革命中的一些消极因素呢？
    主要还在于他们本身具有一定的弱点。同一般工人比较起来：他们心冷了些，眼高了些，手懒了些，气粗了些。
    心冷了些。就是不像一般工人那样热情洋溢、全心全意地响应党的号召，他们对党的技术革命的号召是半信半疑，三心二意。他们不像一般工人那样，看到机械工业赶不上需要就发急，当作自己的事那样设计生法，也缺乏那种冲天的干劲。
  眼高了些。是由于懂了一点技术，就看不起土的，更瞧不起一般人的力量。不愿因陋就简，更不相信群策群力。见物不见人，总想大的洋的，眼界高而且空，不切实际。
    手懒了些。想一切仰赖现成，“万事俱备”了，还得别人去替他借东风”。要他从小处着手，一点一滴地作起来，不肯；要他克服困难，自己动手创设条件，就更不肯。
    气粗了些。是不知爱惜国家财产，动不动就是想用钱去买。不懂得什么叫废物利用，也不懂得什么叫劳动创造。
    总起来说，这还是政治没有挂了帅。因此使得技术这样一种有用的东西，在他们手里反而有时要化成一种蒙蔽思想的障眼物。他们思想上还没有插起红旗，立场还没有完全改变，思想也还没有解放。
    但是，技术究竟是有用的东西。技术本身并不必然包含消极因素。只要他们心肠热起来，看问题切实些，手放勤快些，知道痛惜国家资财；一句话政治挂了帅，也举起“多快好省”和技术革命的红旗来。那末，他们的技术也将会放射出光辉，在今年的更大的跃进里，他们也会成为对祖国建设有更大贡献的人。
