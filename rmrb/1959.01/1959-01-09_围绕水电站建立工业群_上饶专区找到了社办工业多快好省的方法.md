    Building Industrial Clusters Around Hydropower Stations
    Shangrao Prefecture Finds a Way for Communes to Run Industry with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results

    (Our report) Jiangxi Shangrao Prefecture's people's communes have established over a hundred industrial clusters centered around small hydropower stations in the past year of 1958. These small industrial clusters have six major advantages: low investment, fast construction, high output, good comprehensive utilization, convenient management, and labor saving.
    Last spring, when Shangrao Prefecture launched agricultural societies to establish industries on a large scale, a prominent problem encountered was the lack of power machinery.
    What method could be used to solve the power problem? At that time, Tianjin Prefecture had built a hydropower station with a water head of only seven inches. This gave the Shangrao Prefectural Committee great inspiration. In April, the Shangrao Prefectural Committee began to trial small hydropower stations in agricultural societies such as Lilin Township in Leping County and Xintian Township in Guixi County; around the hydropower stations, power plants, grain and feed processing plants, oil presses, sugar refineries, granular fertilizer factories, and pig farms were established. A single water turbine was used to drive the generators and the machines of various processing plants, producing during the day and generating electricity for lighting at night. After more than two months of trial practice, the results proved to be very good and had many advantages. The Shangrao Prefectural Committee believed that this had found a way for rural areas to develop industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and decided to promote it throughout the area. With the establishment of people's communes, up to now, most of the sixteen counties (cities) in the area have established more than a hundred such industrial clusters, creating a new landscape of factories and humming machinery.
    The industrial clusters in Shangrao Prefecture are actually a kind of combined factory that comprehensively utilizes power. It has the following advantages for promoting the large-scale development of industry in communes:
    1. Low Investment: Shangrao Prefecture has adopted methods such as comprehensive use of equipment, simple factory construction using local materials, and using local materials instead of foreign ones, greatly reducing the investment in establishing industrial clusters. First, due to the concentration of factories, the factory buildings, water turbines, and even transmission belts of each industrial cluster are mostly used comprehensively, that is, a group of factories are built in a unified large factory building, and a water turbine and a small number of belts are installed. Second, they make use of existing old materials and old houses to rebuild factories. The investment in industrial clusters throughout the area generally costs about 5,000 yuan, and only more than 3,000 yuan if no generators are installed. Assuming an industrial cluster has six factories, the average investment for a factory is at most only 800 yuan.
    2. Fast Construction: Due to the unified construction of factory buildings and the ease of installation, and because hydropower stations can be built even with a minimum water head of seven inches, the infrastructure and water conservancy projects are simple, and the construction speed is also very fast. More than a hundred industrial clusters in the area, with a total of more than six hundred factories, were built one after another in just over a month.
    3. High Output: Since there are various factories and machines in the industrial cluster, it is very convenient to carry out part-time production and diversified operations, making the products diverse.
    4. Good Comprehensive Utilization of Resources: In the industrial cluster, both separate processing and production and comprehensive utilization of material resources can be carried out. The main agricultural product in Shangrao Prefecture is rice, and the resources comprehensively utilized by various industrial clusters in the area are also mainly rice. The coarse bran separated from rice processed by rice mills is handed over to feed factories for processing and crushing as feed; the fine bran separated from rice processed by rice mills is used by oil presses to extract rice bran oil; the bran cake after oil extraction is handed over to wineries to brew wine or manufacture maltose; the remaining oil residue, distiller's grains, and sugar residue are processed into mixed feed to supply the pig farms attached to the industrial cluster for feeding pigs. In this way, one thing is used for multiple purposes, and no material resources are wasted.
    5. Convenient Management: Since the factories are concentrated, each industrial cluster uses one team to manage seven or eight factories, which is not only well-organized but also participates in production. The industrial cluster of the Gaofeng People's Commune includes a hydropower station, rice milling, feed processing, oil pressing, wine making, maltose making, and an attached pig farm, consisting of seven units in total, while the management cadres of the entire industrial cluster are only six people. They uniformly manage the work of all seven units, collectively discuss matters, and divide the work; when there is nothing to do, they participate in the production of various factories and assist workers in operation.
    6. Labor Saving: Concentrating various types of factories for production greatly reduces the transportation tasks between factories, thus saving a large number of laborers. At the same time, it also facilitates workers to learn technology in many aspects, becoming multi-skilled and versatile; and it is convenient to cooperate with each other, which also correspondingly reduces the labor and assistant personnel attached to each type of work.
    The Shangrao Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the experience of the area in building industrial clusters centered on hydropower stations, and decided to further promote it throughout the area this year, requiring all more than 250 people's communes in the area to establish an average of more than three small industrial clusters to accelerate the process of commune industrialization.

    围绕水电站建立工业群
    上饶专区找到了社办工业多快好省的方法
    本报讯　江西上饶专区各人民公社1958年一年以来，建立起一百多个以小型水电动力站为中心的工业群。这种小型工业群具有投资少、建设快、产品多、综合利用好、管理方便、节省劳动力等六大优点。
    去年春季，上饶专区发动农业社大量兴办工业的时候，普遍碰到的一个突出问题是动力机械缺乏。
    用什么办法解决动力呢？当时，天津专区在水流落差只有七公寸的情况下建成了水电站。这件事给上饶地委很大的启发。4月间，上饶地委即在乐平县礼林乡、贵溪县新田乡等农业社试办了小型水电动力站；围绕水电动力站的四周，建立起发电厂和粮食、饲料、榨油、制糖、颗粒肥料等等农产品加工工厂和养猪场，用一个水轮机统一带动发电机和各种加工工厂的机器，白天生产，晚上发电照明。经过两个多月试办的实践证明，效果非常良好，优点很多。上饶地委认为这为农村发展工业找到了多快好省的方法，决定在全区推广。随着人民公社的建立，到现在止，全区十六个县（市）的大部分人民公社已建立起一百多个这样的工业群，出现了工厂林立、机器轰鸣的新面貌。
    上饶专区的工业群，实际上就是一种综合利用动力的联合工厂。它对促进公社大办工业具有如下优点：
    一、投资少：上饶专区各地根据工业群的特点，采取了综合使用设备、因陋就简办厂、以土代洋等办法，大大降低了建立工业群的投资。首先由于工厂集中，各工业群的厂房、水轮机、甚至传动皮带大都是综合使用的，即一群工厂盖上一个统一的大厂房，安装一部水轮机和少部分皮带。其次是因陋就简，利用原有的旧材料、旧房屋改建厂房。全区各地的工业群投资一般都花五千元左右，没有安装发电机的，则只花三千多元。一个工业群以六个工厂计算，平均一个工厂的投资最多只有八百元。
    二、建设快：由于厂房建筑统一，安装简便，同时，在最低水流落差七公寸的情况下都可建立水电动力站，因此基建工程和水利工程任务单一，建设速度也很快。全区一百多个工业群，计有六百多个工厂，总共只花了一个多月的时间便先后建成。
    三、产品多：由于工业群内有着各种各样的工厂和机器，因此十分便于进行兼业生产和多种经营，使生产的产品多种多样。
    四、综合利用资源好：在工业群内，既可以分别进行加工生产，又可以综合利用物质资源。上饶专区主要农产品是水稻，该区各个工业群综合利用的资源也就以水稻为主。稻谷经过碾米厂加工分出来的粗糠，便交给饲料厂加工粉碎，当作饲料；碾米厂加工分出来的细糠，则由榨油厂榨米糠油；榨油厂榨油后的糠饼，又交给酿酒厂酿酒，或是制造成饴糖；剩下来的油脚、酒糟和糖糟，又加工成混合饲料，供给工业群内附设的养猪场喂猪。这样，就做到了一物多用，不浪费一点物质资源。
    五、管理方便：由于工厂集中，各工业群都是用一套人马管理七八个工厂，不仅管理有条不乱，而且还参加生产。高峰人民公社的工业群，计有水电站、碾米、饲料加工、榨油、酿酒、制饴糖等工厂，和一个附设的养猪场，共由七个单位组成，而整个工业群的管理干部只有六名。他们统一管理着全群七个单位的工作，有事集体研究，分工办理；无事则分头参加各厂生产，协助工人操作。
    六、节省劳动力：各种不同工种的工厂集中一起生产，首先大大减少了各工厂之间的运输任务，因而可以节约大批劳动力。同时，更便利了工人多方面学习技术，做到一人多艺，成为多面手；并且便于互相协作，这也就相应地减少了每一个工种附属性的劳力和助手人员。
    中共上饶地委最近总结了全区兴办以水电动力站为中心的工业群的经验，决定今年在全区进一步推广，要求全区二百五十多个人民公社平均都建立起三个以上的小工业群，以加速公社工业化的进程。
