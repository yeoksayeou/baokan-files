    Not a Single Drop Wasted
    On New Year's Day, the Qianjin People's Commune in Tongnan County, Sichuan, had a holiday. Qiu Zhengcai, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Fifth District team, had breakfast and went to the street with the commune members to see the festivities.
    Not far from the house, he found a lot of dog feces on the road. He thought that to achieve a greater leap forward, there must be more fertilizer, so why not take advantage of today's rest to pick it up and take it back. Thinking of this, he slowed down. "Captain Qiu, hurry up!" Someone in front of him shouted. "Coming!" he replied, taking a few more steps forward, but there was more and more dog feces, and it was really a bit heartbreaking to see. After hesitating for a while, he made a decisive decision: no rest! He immediately turned around and went home to fetch the manure baskets.
    As the sun was setting, commune members returned from the street in twos and threes. Someone saw Qiu Zhengcai swaying as he carried a load into the yard from afar. "What is he carrying?" Several young people ran into the yard to see. "Wow! He picked up so much dog feces!" The commune members were very moved by the captain's emphasis on accumulating fertilizer.

    点滴不丢
    元旦这天，四川潼南县前进人民公社放了假。五区队二大队队长丘正才，吃过早饭，和社员一道上街去看热闹。
    出门不远，就发现路上有许多狗屎。他想，要实现更大的跃进，必须有更多的肥料，趁今天休息，不如把它拣回去。他想到这里，便放慢了脚步。“丘队长，走快点啦！”前面有人在喊他。“来了！”他一面答应，一面又向前走了几步，可是狗屎越来越多，看了实在有点心疼。他犹豫了一阵之后，便做了个果断的决定：不休息！马上转过身来，回家去挑粪篼。
    太阳落坡了，社员们三三两两地从街上回来，有人远远望见丘正才摇摇摆摆担着一挑东西走进院子里。“他挑的是什么东西？”几个青年特地跑进院子去看。“呀！拣了这么多狗屎！”社员们对于队长这样重视积肥，很受感动。（袁世民）（附图片）
