Dawn on the Mengla River
    Chen Jianyao

    In winter, the Mengla River reveals half its bed of pebbles. The pebbles are round and white, like rice sprouts scattered in a shallow paddy field, stretching from the riverbank to the river's heart. The clear, green water flowing from the deep mountain gullies crashes against the stones, splashing up pure white foam, creating a gurgling sound. This beautiful sound is like the song of the Mengla River, like the laughter of the Mengla River. At dawn, this song and laughter are especially loud, as if awakening the Dai people on both sides of the river to welcome a new and busy dawn.
    At dawn, the river is shrouded in a thick fog.
    In those days more than nine years ago, the riverbank at dawn was also shrouded in thick fog. At that time, the Tusi (chieftain) monopolized the river, monopolized the land, and even used the river as a knife, severing the connection between the people on both sides. People were afraid to leave their bamboo houses at dawn, and the riverbank at dawn was silent.
    Now, the dawn on both sides of the river is no longer so quiet.
    A group of Dai girls are the first to welcome the dawn. They are delicately wrapped in white cloth headscarves, tightly dressed in pure white tops, and slightly lifting their indigo tube skirts, carrying bamboo tubes, and joyfully come to the river.
    With a "splash," the bamboo tube is placed in the water, filled to the brim, and then carried on their backs, forming a team and walking towards the wheat fields, towards the wheat fields they are cultivating for the first time.
    The Party Committee Secretary came to this wheat field and is telling them how to water it. The secretary is from Henan Province and brought the experience of growing wheat to the border villages. But they must first teach him how to use the three or four-foot-long bamboo tube. The bamboo tube rustles in the bamboo palm, the water flows towards the wheat seedlings' roots with a "whoosh," and songs and laughter float in the fog above the wheat field. ...
    At the ferry crossing, a wooden boat slowly embeds itself into the water. The boat is carved from a large tree, more than ten feet long and a foot wide, without a cabin or oars. Now it is fully loaded with people, the elderly, women, and children, each carrying a bamboo basket on their backs. The bamboo baskets are heavy and shiny, filled with fertilizer, bananas, and ore. The boatman pushes with a pole, the wooden boat breaks through the fog, paddling upstream, and then flows to the other side as if pulled by a cable. A large group of people carrying bamboo baskets are waiting on the opposite bank, listening quietly.
    In the middle of the river, there is a sound of horses hitting the water with their bodies, and the shouts of the horse drivers. The people on the boat listen quietly, guessing that it is the commune's horse caravan crossing the river.
    "Dao Zhengzhong, where is the horse caravan going?" an old man on the boat calls out.
    "Transporting surplus grain to the county!" a young man's voice answers.
    "What are you bringing back?" several women near the side of the boat ask in unison.
    "Carrying cotton seeds!"
    The women look at each other and nod in satisfaction. It must be that they are cultivating a cotton field.
    The thick fog slowly thins. The slender betel nut trees on the riverbank are the first to reveal their lush green tops, followed by the green umbrella-like mango trees, the fan-like banana groves, and the green wheat fields. In this lush greenery, reminiscent of northern summers, the pure white tops of the Dai women and the white cloth headscarves of the Dai youth appear, one point, two points...
    The thin fog gradually dissipates, rises, and disappears into the pink sky. The fields and villages on both sides of the Mengla River are covered in golden sunlight. ...

    勐拉河的黎明
    陈鉴尧
    冬天，勐拉河露出了半河石子，石子滚圆而又粉白，像谷芽撒在浅水的秧田里，从河边一直铺向河心。由深山箐沟流出来碧绿的水，撞在石子上，溅起洁白的水沫，发出淙淙的响声。这优美的响声，就像勐拉河的歌，就像勐拉河的笑。在黎明的时候，这歌声和笑声格外响亮，它好像唤醒河边两岸的傣族人民，来欢迎一个新的、忙碌的黎明。
    黎明，河上笼罩着浓厚的雾。
    九年多前的那些日子，黎明的河边，也是笼罩着浓厚的雾。那时候，土司霸占着河，霸占着土地，还用河当作刀子，割断了两岸人民的联系。人们害怕在黎明的时候，走出自己的竹楼，河边的黎明静寂着。
    现在，河两岸就没有那样静寂的黎明了。
    一群傣族姑娘是黎明的第一批欢迎者。她们精致地扎着白布头巾，紧紧穿着洁白的上衣，微微地撩起青靛筒裙，抱着竹筒，欢乐地到河边来了。
    “哗”的一声，竹筒放到水里，汲满了水，又背起来，成队向麦田里走去，走向她们第一次培育的麦田。
    区委书记来到了这块麦田，在告诉她们浇水。书记是河南省人，把种麦子的经验带到边疆的寨子。但她们却首先要教他使用三、四尺长的竹筒。竹筒在竹掌中沙沙地响，水哗哗的朝麦苗根流去，歌声和笑声，在麦田上空的雾中飘荡。……
    在摆渡口的地方，一只木船慢慢嵌进水里，船是用一株大树剜成的，丈多长，尺多宽，没有船舱没有桨。现在满满地载着人，老人、妇女、孩子，一个个背着篾篮。篾篮沉甸甸，亮闪闪，那是肥料，香蕉，矿砂。船夫用篙一点，木船冲开雾气，逆水上划，以后便像有根缆牵着一样，顺水流向对岸。对岸一大群背篾篓的人，在等候着，静听着。
    河中间响起一阵马用身子打水的啪啪声，和赶马人驾驾的?喝声。船上的人静听着，猜出那是公社的马帮过河去。
    “刀正忠，马帮往哪里去呀？”船上一个老头招呼道。
    “运余粮到县上去呀！”一个年青人的声音。
    “回来驮什么呀？挨在船帮的几个妇女齐声问道。
      “驮棉籽呵！”
    妇女们互相望望，满意地点头笑了。准是她们正在耕作一块棉田哩。
    浓雾慢慢地薄了。河边瘦高的槟榔树，最先现出它那浓绿的树顶，接着，绿伞一般的芒果树出现了，扇舞一般的芭蕉林出现了，青青的麦田出现了。在这一片有如北方夏天的万绿丛中，傣族妇女洁白的上衣，傣族青年白布的包头出现了，一点，两点……
    薄雾渐渐地散开，升起，消失到粉红的天幕里去了。勐拉河两岸的田野和村寨，披上了金色的阳光。……
