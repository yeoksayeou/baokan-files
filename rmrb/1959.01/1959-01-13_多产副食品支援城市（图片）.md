Productive Subsidiary Foodstuffs Support the City

    During this season, many regions are carrying out busy subsidiary food production activities. Hunters have gone to the high mountains, fishermen have come to the waterside, pigs and sheep are being carefully raised, and ducks and chickens are multiplying in large numbers. Commune members all have a common goal: to do a good job in subsidiary food production, support cities and industrial and mining areas, and let workers produce more and better agricultural tools and daily necessities to supply the countryside.

    People in Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, have broken the superstition that fish cannot be raised in sandy wasteland areas and are actively developing fish farming. Recently, 150,000 jin of fresh fish have been caught to supply the needs of the city.

    The left picture shows the people of Zhangwu County braving the severe cold of minus ten degrees Celsius to fish in the frozen river.

    The right picture shows the delicious and meaty bighead carp that has been caught.

    多产副食品支援城市
    在这个季节里，许多地区开展了繁忙的副食品生产活动。打猎的上了高山，捞鱼的来到水边，猪羊被精心饲养，鸡鸭在大量繁殖。公社社员都有一个共同的目的：搞好副食品生产，支援城市和工矿区，让工人生产更多更好的农具和生活日用品来供应农村。
    辽宁省彰武县的人民打破了关于沙荒地区不能养鱼的迷信，积极发展养鱼事业。最近已捕了十五万斤鲜鱼供应城市需要。
