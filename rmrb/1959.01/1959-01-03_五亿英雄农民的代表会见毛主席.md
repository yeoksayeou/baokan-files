Representatives of 500 Million Heroic Peasants Meet Chairman Mao
By our reporters Yu Minsheng, Yuan Mu, Wang Zhuofei

From the day they arrived in Beijing, the representatives of 500 million heroic peasants longed to meet Chairman Mao. On the afternoon of New Year's Day, 1959, their wish came true!

At 4:45 p.m. on this day, in the spacious Beijing Gymnasium hall, the band played "The East is Red," countless mercury lamps shone brightly, and all six thousand representatives stood up, erupting in enthusiastic cheers and applause. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, along with Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, and other central leaders, slowly entered the hall. No words can describe the unprecedentedly moving scene in the hall. Six thousand pairs of eyes were fixed on Chairman Mao's healthy figure and kind smile, six thousand hands applauded vigorously, and six thousand people shouted in unison:
"Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! He applauded with everyone, he laughed with everyone, and he repeatedly raised his hand to congratulate the representatives of the 500 million heroic peasants who had achieved unprecedented great victories on the agricultural front in 1958. Chairman Mao and the central leaders slowly circled the hall, meeting with the representatives. Wherever they went, even louder waves of cheers and jubilation erupted.

It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led the 500 million peasants to achieve the unprecedented bumper harvest on the agricultural front in 1958. Today, on the first day of 1959, Chairman Mao and other central leaders meet with the representatives of the 500 million heroic peasants. For the 500 million peasants, this is a new and greater encouragement, which will enable them to create even greater miracles in the new year.

In the jubilant gymnasium hall, we saw a middle-aged peasant, sweating profusely, shouting at the top of his voice: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Ah! He is Comrade Cui Ruogu, the Party branch secretary of the Yingju People's Commune – the cooperative that Chairman Mao introduced to the people of the whole country in the Red Flag magazine, a cooperative that had changed its appearance after three years of hard work.

Filled with boundless gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao, Cui Ruogu could not contain his excitement after seeing Chairman Mao. Since Chairman Mao introduced their cooperative in the Red Flag magazine, and since Chairman Mao received their cooperative's director, Cui Xiyan, more than half a year ago, the members have kept in mind every word of encouragement from Chairman Mao during labor and production. Chairman Mao once said to Cui Xiyan: "Be modest and prudent, cadres and the masses must unite closely, and the red flag must always be planted in your cooperative and raised higher and higher." When Cui Xiyan brought back Chairman Mao's instructions, Yingju Cooperative was abuzz, everyone was excited and encouraged, and everyone was full of vigor. At that time, they made a vow to achieve a yield of one thousand catties of grain per mu and strive to report the good news to Chairman Mao at the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction.

What our people say, they can do. The heroic people of Yingju Cooperative are like this. For more than half a year, they have worked diligently, day and night, overcoming numerous difficulties. The more than two thousand mu of paddy fields, which were planted for the first time in their waterlogged and disaster-prone land, finally achieved large-scale yield increase, with an average yield of 1,300 catties of rice per mu, exceeding the promise they made to our great leader Chairman Mao.

The Party branch secretary of Yingju People's Commune came to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction, carrying the wish of the entire commune to "report good news to Chairman Mao." How could Cui Ruogu not be happy when he saw Chairman Mao! He said: "We will always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, always maintain the red flag of increased production, and let the red flag be raised higher and higher!"

Chairman Mao and the central leaders had left the gymnasium long ago. However, Wang Xiulan, the famous "Cotton Girl" of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Suixian County, Hubei Province, was still immersed in happiness and joy. She jumped and said to people: "Today is the happiest and most glorious day for me!" She told people again and again about the scene of her shaking hands with Chairman Mao.

It was this twenty-year-old young woman who led 271 women to plant 310 mu of cotton experimental fields in 1958. The experimental fields of 255 people all yielded more than 2,000 catties of seed cotton per mu. The three mu of experimental fields she planted herself yielded more than 6,000 catties of seed cotton per mu, and the other two mu yielded more than 4,000 catties of seed cotton per mu, so she was known as the "Cotton Girl."

When Wang Xiulan was about to come to Beijing to attend the meeting, the female team members said: "When you go to Beijing, you will definitely see Chairman Mao, don't forget to say hello to Chairman Mao on behalf of all of us!" Before the closing ceremony of the meeting began, Wang Xiulan sat there, anxiously waiting for that happy moment to arrive. At 4:45 p.m., Chairman Mao and the central leaders finally arrived. Wang Xiulan excitedly jumped and cheered, clapping her hands vigorously. Chairman Mao came to her side and shook hands with her kindly. Wang Xiulan said repeatedly: "Hello, Chairman Mao! Hello, Chairman Mao!" After Chairman Mao left, Wang Xiulan said to the people: "I shook hands with Chairman Mao! After I go back, as long as the task is put forward by the Party and Chairman Mao, no matter what difficulties I encounter, I have to stand up and do it!"

Yang Zengzhan, the representative of the heroic people from the desert area, was so excited and excited when Chairman Mao walked past him during the tour of the venue, that he could not wait to stride out of his seat and pour out all the changes on the Yuidong Canal construction site to Chairman Mao. At this time, a series of moving scenes of the people of Shaanxi fighting against the desert flashed in his mind. Chairman Mao's teachings and people's infinite love for the great leader are such a huge force to encourage people to forge ahead!

The Yuidong Canal, which diverts water to transform the desert, began construction in March 1958. Transforming the desert is an arduous struggle against nature, but people have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "we are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before," setting off a competition craze to "create miracles to report good news to Chairman Mao." The entire construction site was always full of infinite youthful vitality. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic peasants, who unleashed endless potential, finally overcame various serious difficulties such as continuous heavy rain and flood impact, and victoriously completed the pre-determined canal construction tasks for 1958. Now, this Yuidong Canal, which is 280 li long in total, has extended 140 li into the heart of the desert, and the desert has shown the appearance of "small fish playing in shallow grass, scenery catching up with Jiangnan."

After Yang Zengzhan met Chairman Mao, he made up his mind to ensure that after returning, he would work together with his fellow villagers to continue to gradually realize the water conservancy of the desert area, turn the desert into a land of fish and rice, and come to Beijing again to see Chairman Mao with new achievements.

An old lady with many gold medals on her chest was excitedly cheering and applauding. Chairman Mao asked Comrade Kang Keqing: "Who is she?" Comrade Kang Keqing told Chairman Mao: "She is Cao Yixiu, the famous Dai ethnic mouse-catching expert from Yunnan Province!" Chairman Mao was so happy that he repeatedly called Cao Yixiu's name and held Cao Yixiu's hand tightly with both hands.

Standing in front of Chairman Mao and holding Chairman Mao's hand, this 65-year-old Dai ethnic mother felt infinite warmth and happiness! She was as enthusiastic and excited as a young man, and her heart was blooming! But she could not think of a proper word to express her feelings. She just kept shouting: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Hello, Chairman Mao!"

It was the people's revolution led by the Party and Chairman Mao that liberated her from the sea of suffering of being oppressed and exploited in the old society, and today she is living a happy and joyful life!

In the past, in Cao Yixiu's hometown – Jiubao Street, Lianghe County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture – there were so many mice. They did not know how much grain they ate from the people, how many clothes they bit, how many infectious diseases they brought, and how many people's lives they harmed. But the reactionary rulers in history never cared about this matter. Only after liberation, did the Party and the government led by Chairman Mao lead the people to completely eliminate the rat plague. Cao Yixiu responded to Chairman Mao's call and was determined to wipe out the mice. For eight years, Cao Yixiu has persisted in the fight against mice. At first, when she carried strings of dead mice home, superstitious people said: "You have killed so many mice, it will take your life in the future!" Cao Yixiu laughed and said: "The living mice have been killed by me, how can the dead mice take my life?" Later, many people took action under her propaganda. Cao Yixiu also created a set of mouse-catching methods and promoted them among the masses. People encouraged her: "Grandma is really good at digging, she has dug so many, she will definitely see Chairman Mao in the future!" This is exactly what Cao Yixiu was thinking. So, she worked even harder. Since 1951, she has eliminated a total of 10,663 mice and has been rewarded seven times in the past eight years. Everyone calls her an "old model." She said: "This honor should be attributed to the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao!"

In the thunderous applause and in the cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao," people saw Chairman Mao shaking hands tightly with a Korean ethnic young woman on the rostrum. This Korean ethnic woman is Li Mingshu, a labor model from Heilongjiang.

Li Mingshu told reporters that on New Year's Eve in 1958, she dreamed that Chairman Mao came. She gave the six catties of rice from the high-yield field to Chairman Mao and said excitedly to Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I wish you good health forever! I guarantee to you: I will always be a good daughter of the Party. Chairman Mao kept smiling at her, thanking her for the gift, and wishing her good wishes could be realized. At this time, how happy and excited she was….

On New Year's Day, Li Mingshu thought, the meeting is about to close today, maybe Chairman Mao will come to attend our closing ceremony! So she put on a pink silk top and a black silk skirt to attend the meeting. On this day, she really saw Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao kindly shook hands with her on the rostrum. Li Mingshu held Chairman Mao's hand tightly with both hands and shouted loudly: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" But she forgot the few words she had originally prepared to say to Chairman Mao.

Li Mingshu is a labor model, a model military family member, and now the captain of the Chaoyang Production Team of the Sifangtai People's Commune in Suihua County. In 1958, the 174 hectares of land in this team produced an average of 12,000 catties of grain per hectare, which was 7,000 catties more per hectare than in 1957, exceeding the target of the Great Leap Forward. After meeting Chairman Mao, Li Mingshu said excitedly: "I will always maintain the honor given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao, never be proud, continue to move forward, and always be a good daughter of the Party!"

It was late at night, but Yang Yingzhong, the Party Secretary of the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, was still not asleep, immersed in happy memories for a long time. In the past few months, Yang Yingzhong often dreamed that he had returned to Chairman Mao's side, looking up at the kind smile of our great leader and listening to his kind instructions, reporting his work to him without restraint at the leader's side.

One evening in September last year, Chairman Mao came to the Shucha People's Commune to inspect work. Whenever Yang Yingzhong recalled that happiest moment, he could not suppress the excitement in his heart. Our great leader not only inquired in detail about the commune's production and work from Yang Yingzhong and others, asked how the peasants were eating and wearing, how much vegetables the commune planted and whether it was enough, and even asked about minor issues such as whether the cadres had rooms for meetings and whether there were suitable places for mass rallies. He showed such infinite concern for the commune's production and the people's lives. Chairman Mao also instructed their commune to mobilize the masses to run industries on a large scale, plant more cash crops, and do a good job in collective welfare undertakings, and to insist on running the people's commune better. From the time Chairman Mao left the Shucha People's Commune until the end of last year, an even more prosperous scene appeared on the thriving land. Tens of thousands of commune members planted several thousand mu of wheat in autumn planting, refined more than 500 tons of steel, and people had prepared seeds and all other conditions, preparing to increase cash crops such as tea, bamboo forests, and oil tea from the original 7,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu this year. This year, they also decided to increase the grain yield from 1,000 catties to about 3,000 catties per commune member on average.

When Yang Yingzhong saw Chairman Mao again in the joyful gymnasium hall, this 30-year-old farmer's heart bloomed and he said excitedly: "The teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao are the great power that will always encourage us to move forward! We must turn the happy meeting into a driving force for progress and resolutely realize the even greater leap forward tasks this year. Wherever the Party and Chairman Mao lead, we will rush there!"

Yang Yingzhong's words expressed the common wish of the 500 million heroic peasants. (Attached picture)

    五亿英雄农民的代表会见毛主席
    本报记者　于民生　袁木　王濯非
    从来到北京的那天起，五亿英雄农民的代表们就渴望着会见毛主席。1959年元旦的下午，他们的愿望实现了！
    这一天下午四时四十五分，在宽阔的北京体育馆大厅里，乐队奏起了“东方红”的乐曲，无数的水银灯齐放光明，六千名代表全体起立，响起了热烈的欢呼声和掌声。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和周恩来、朱德、陈云、邓小平同志和中央的其他领导同志缓步进入了大厅。所有的字眼都不能形容出大厅里空前动人的情景。六千双眼睛都看着毛主席那健康的身体和慈祥的笑脸，六千双手都在用力鼓掌，六千个人发出了共同的欢呼：
  “毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席啊！他和大家一起鼓掌，他和大家一起欢笑，他不时举起手，向1958年在农业战线上取得了空前伟大胜利的五亿英雄农民的代表们表示祝贺。毛主席和中央的领导同志缓缓地环行大厅一周，同代表们会见，他们走到哪里，哪里就激起了一阵阵更加响亮的欢腾的声浪。
    是党和毛主席领导五亿农民取得了1958年的农业战线上空前大丰收。今天，1959年的第一天，毛主席和中央的其他领导同志会见五亿英雄农民的代表，对五亿农民说来，这是一个新的更大的鼓舞，它将使五亿农民在新的一年中创造更伟大的奇迹。
    在那万众欢腾的体育馆大厅里，我们看到了一位中年农民，他冒出了满头热汗，放开喉咙不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”啊！他就是毛主席在红旗杂志上向全国人民介绍的苦战三年改变了面貌的那个合作社——现在的应举人民公社的支部书记崔若谷同志。
    怀着对党和毛主席感激不尽的心情，崔若谷在看到了毛主席以后，怎样也抑制不住发自内心的兴奋感情。自从毛主席在红旗杂志上介绍了他们的合作社以后，自从毛主席接见了他们的合作社社长崔希彦以后，到现在已经半年多了，社员们在劳动和生产的时候，时时刻刻都牢记着毛主席勉励他们的每一句话语。毛主席曾对崔希彦说：“要戒骄戒躁，干部和群众要紧密地团结，要把红旗永远插在你们社里，让红旗越插越高。”当崔希彦把毛主席的指示带回去以后，应举社沸腾了，人人兴奋鼓舞，个个干劲冲天。那时候，他们就订下了实现亩产千斤粮食的誓言，争取到全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议上向毛主席报喜。
    我们的人民说什么就能做到什么。英雄的应举社人民也是这样的。半年多以来，他们披星戴月地辛勤劳动，战胜了重重困难，在他们易涝多灾的土地上第一次改种的两千多亩水稻，终于获得了大面积增产，每亩平均收水稻一千三百斤，超额实现了向我们伟大领袖毛主席许下的诺言。
    应举人民公社的党支部书记，带着全社人民“向毛主席报喜”的愿望来北京出席全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。崔若谷见到了毛主席，他怎么能不欢欣呢！他说：“我们永远都要听党和毛主席的话，永远保持着增产的红旗，让红旗越插越高！”
    毛主席和中央的领导同志已经离开体育馆很久了。可是湖北省随县东风人民公社著名的“棉花姑娘”汪秀兰依然沉浸在幸福和欢乐里。她蹦着跳着对人说：“今天是我最幸福最光荣的一天！”她一次又一次地向人们讲述着她和毛主席握手的情景。
    就是这位二十岁的年青姑娘，在1958年领导了二百七十一位妇女种了三百一十亩棉花试验田，有二百五十五人的试验田，都是亩产籽棉两千斤以上的。她自己种的三亩试验田，有一亩收了六千多斤籽棉，其他两亩各收了四千多斤籽棉，因而，她被人们誉为“棉花姑娘”。
    当汪秀兰要到北京来参加会议的时候，妇女队员们都说：“你到北京一定能见到毛主席，千万别忘了代我们大家向毛主席问好！”在会议的闭幕式还没开始的时候，汪秀兰坐在那里，焦急地等待着那幸福的时刻到来。四点四十五分，毛主席和中央的领导同志终于来了，汪秀兰激动地跳着欢呼着，两只手用劲地鼓着掌。毛主席来到了她的身边，亲切地同她握了手，汪秀兰连声说：“毛主席好！毛主席好！”毛主席走了以后，汪秀兰对人们说：“我同毛主席握手了！回去以后，只要党和毛主席提出来的任务，不管碰到什么困难我也得挺起腰来干哪！”
    来自沙漠地带的英雄人民的代表杨增占，在毛主席绕场一周走过他的面前时，他是那样地激动和兴奋，恨不得迈开大步走出自己的座位，向毛主席倾吐出榆东渠工地上的一切变化。这时，在他的脑海中闪出了一幕幕陕西人民同沙漠作斗争的动人场景。毛主席的教导和人们对伟大领袖的无限热爱，是多么巨大的鼓舞人们奋勇向前的力量啊！
    引水改造沙漠的榆东渠是在1958年3月开始动工的。改造沙漠是一场同大自然进行的艰苦斗争，但是，人们却牢牢地记住了毛主席教导的“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”这句话，掀起了
  “创造奇迹向毛主席报喜”的竞赛热潮，整个工地上始终充满了无限的青春活力。在党和毛主席的领导下发挥出无穷潜力的英雄农民们，终于克服了连日大雨、洪水冲击等各式各样的严重困难，胜利地完成了1958年预定的建渠任务。现在，这条总长二百八十里的榆东渠，已经向沙漠的心脏弯弯曲曲地伸延了一百四十里，沙漠上已经出现了“小鱼戏浅草、景象赶江南”的面貌。
    杨增占见到毛主席以后，他下定了决心，保证回去以后要同乡亲们一起，继续努力逐步实现沙漠地带水利化，让沙漠变成鱼米之乡，带着新的功绩到北京来再见毛主席。
    一位胸前佩戴着许多金质奖章的老太太激动地在欢呼鼓掌。毛主席问康克清同志：“她是谁？”康克清同志告诉毛主席：“她就是闻名全国的云南省傣族捕鼠专家曹依秀！”毛主席是那样地高兴，他连连地叫着曹依秀的名字，用双手紧紧地握着曹依秀的手。
    站在毛主席的面前，握着毛主席的手，这位六十五岁的傣族老妈妈感到无限的温暖和幸福！她像年青人一样的热情沸腾，心花怒放！可是她连一句表达自己心情的恰当话语也想不起来，她只是不停地喊着：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席你好！”
    是党和毛主席领导的人民革命，把她从旧社会受压迫受剥削的苦海里解放出来，今天过着欢乐幸福的生活！
    过去，在曹依秀的家乡——德宏傣族景颇族自治州梁河县九保街一带，老鼠是那样多。不知道吃了人民多少粮食，咬烂了多少衣服，带来了多少传染病，伤害了多少人的生命。但是历史上的反动统治者从来也没有管过这件事情。只有在解放以后，毛主席领导的党和政府才领导人民彻底扑灭鼠害。曹依秀响应了毛主席的号召，一心要把老鼠消灭光。八年来，曹依秀一直坚持了和老鼠的斗争。最初当她提着一串串死老鼠回家的时候，有迷信思想的人说：“你打死这么多老鼠，以后它会要你的命哩！”曹依秀笑了，她说：“活老鼠都叫我整死了，死老鼠怎么会要我的命呢？”后来，多少群众都在她的宣传下行动起来了。曹依秀还创造了一套捕鼠的办法在群众中间推广。人们鼓励她：“大妈真会挖，挖了那么多，将来一定会去见毛主席！”这话正说中了曹依秀的心事。于是，她干得更加起劲了。从1951年以来，她一共消灭了一万零六百六十三只老鼠，八年来受到七次奖励，人人都叫她是“老模范”。她说：“这荣誉都应归功于党和毛主席的好领导！”
    在春雷般的掌声中，在“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中，人们看到了毛主席在主席台上和一位朝鲜族青年妇女在紧紧握手，这位朝鲜族妇女就是黑龙江劳动模范李明淑。
    李明淑告诉记者，在1958年除夕的那天夜间，她睡梦中看到毛主席来了，她把带来的高产田里的六斤大米送给了毛主席，兴奋地对毛主席说，毛主席，祝您永远健康！我向您保证：永远做党的好女儿。毛主席不断地向她一直微笑着，感谢他的礼物，并祝她的美好愿望能够实现，这时，她是怎样地高兴和激动啊……。
    元旦这天，李明淑想，今天会议就要闭幕了，说不定毛主席会来参加我们的闭幕式呢！于是她穿上粉红色的绸上衣和黑色的绸裙子，去参加大会。这一天，她真的见到了毛主席。毛主席在主席台上同她亲切地握了手。李明淑用双手紧紧握着毛主席的手，大声喊着：“毛主席！毛主席！”可是，她却把原来准备向毛主席说的几句话都忘记了。
    李明淑是劳动模范，又是军属模范，现在是绥化县四方台人民公社朝阳生产队的队长。1958年这个队的一百七十四垧地，平均每垧产粮一万两千斤，比1957年每垧多产了七千斤，超额实现了大跃进的指标。李明淑在会见了毛主席以后兴奋地说：“我要永远保持党和毛主席给我的荣誉，决不骄傲，不断前进，永远作党的好女儿！”
    夜深了，安徽省舒城县舒茶人民公社的党委书记杨应忠仍然没有入睡，久久地沉浸在幸福的回忆之中。几个月来，杨应忠经常地梦见自己又回到了毛主席的身边，仰望着我们伟大领袖的慈祥笑容，倾听着他的亲切指示，在领袖的身边毫无拘束地向他汇报自己的工作。
    去年9月间的一个傍晚，毛主席来到了舒茶人民公社视察工作。杨应忠每当回想起那个最幸福的时刻，就怎么也按捺不住内心感情的激荡。我们伟大的领袖不但详细地向杨应忠等询问了公社的生产情况和工作情况，询问了农民们吃得怎样，穿得怎样，社里种了多少蔬菜够不够吃？甚至还问到干部们开会有没有房间，开群众大会有没有合适的场所等细微的问题，他对公社生产和群众生活是那样的无限关怀。毛主席还指示他们公社要发动群众大办工业，多种经济作物和搞好集体福利事业，坚持把人民公社办得更好。从毛主席离开舒茶人民公社以后直到去年年底，欣欣向荣的土地上出现了一幅更加繁荣的景象，几万名社员在秋种中多种了几千亩小麦，炼出了五百多吨钢铁，人们已经准备好种子和其他一切条件，准备在今年把茶叶、竹林和油茶等经济作物从原有的七千多亩增加到两万多亩。今年，他们还决心按每个社员平均，把粮食产量从去年的一千斤提高到三千斤左右。
    杨应忠在欢乐的体育馆大厅里重新见到毛主席的时候，这位三十岁的农民心花怒放，激动地说：“党和毛主席的教导是永远鼓舞我们前进的伟大力量！我们要把幸福的会见变成前进的动力，坚决实现今年更加伟大的跃进任务。党和毛主席指引到那里，我们就奔向那里！”
    杨应忠这段话，表达了五亿英雄农民的共同心愿。（附图片）
