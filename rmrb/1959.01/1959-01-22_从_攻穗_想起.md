From “Attacking the Ears of Wheat” Thinking

	The Nanchong Special District of Sichuan Province has already begun topdressing wheat to "attack the ears of wheat". According to their plan, they will also topdress to "attack the grains" later. Applying different fertilizers in stages according to the needs of different growth stages of crops is a scientific method. It can not only make the crops eat enough, but also eat according to their "appetite". If crops eat according to their "appetite", they will grow stronger and produce more.

	However, to do this, there must be certain material conditions - fertilizers, there must be a sufficient amount of fertilizer, and there must be various fertilizers with different ingredients. This puts forward new requirements for fertilizer accumulation work. Therefore, when vigorously engaging in the fertilizer accumulation movement, we should not only pay attention to the quantity of fertilizer, but also pay attention to the quality and variety of fertilizer.

    从“攻穗”想起
    四川南充专区已经开始对小麦追肥“攻穗”。根据他们的计划，以后还要追肥“攻粒”。按照作物不同生长阶段的需要，分期追施不同肥料，这种作法是科学的，它不仅可以使作物吃得饱，而且吃得对“胃口”。作物吃得对了“胃口”，就能长得更壮，产得更多。
    但是，要这样做，必须有一定的物质条件——肥料，要有足够数量的肥料，还要有各种不同成分的肥料。这又给积肥工作提出了新要求。因此，在大搞积肥运动的时候，我们不仅要注意肥料的数量，而且要注意肥料的质量和品种。
