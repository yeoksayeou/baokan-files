(Reported in Brief) Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The news of the Soviet Union launching a cosmic rocket towards the moon has caused a sensation in the capitalist world. Newspapers of various leanings in many countries believe that this is a huge contribution of the socialist country, the Soviet Union, to mankind. Some newspapers have compared this news with the failure of the American lunar rocket launch.

The London newspapers all published the news about the Soviet Union's successful launch of a cosmic rocket—the first artificial planet in the solar system—in prominent positions. The science correspondent of "The Sunday Times" wrote: "The most important conclusion we must draw is that the Russians now have the ability to launch rockets capable of carrying people to the moon." "The Sunday Express" said: "The whole world is cheering the immense achievement of Russia in launching the first rocket that has completely broken the barrier of Earth's gravity."

"The Reynolds News" pointed out that "American rocket technology is far behind." It said that due to the recent achievements of the Soviet Union, "the military basis of Dulles' brinkmanship policy" has collapsed. The well-known scientific commentator of "The Daily Express," Pincher, wrote that the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States and Britain in rocket manufacturing. He said, "It is quite obvious that in the current stage of rocket research, neither the Americans nor the British can compare with the Russians."

The French public and newspapers are watching the flight of the Soviet cosmic rocket launched towards the moon with increasing interest. Domestic and international news have been pushed to a secondary position. In the January 3rd issue of "Le Monde" and other evening newspapers, almost the entire first two pages were filled with information and articles about the Soviet cosmic rocket.

"Le Figaro" pointed out, "While the Americans were confidently preparing to start this competition, it was the Russians who won the initial victory."

"Le Monde" believes that the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket is an "unprecedented achievement." The newspaper wrote in an editorial: "The Soviets have succeeded where the Americans have failed."

West German newspapers emphasized in their reports that Soviet rocket technology is superior to that of the United States. "Die Welt" wrote: "So far, the United States has launched four rockets to the moon, but none of them have achieved their purpose."

In Italy, all newspapers prominently published TASS's news about the Soviet Union launching a cosmic rocket towards the moon. The bourgeois newspaper "Il Messaggero" emphasized the "huge size" of the rocket. The newspaper said that the Soviet Union's launch of a rocket towards the moon "is a major step forward for mankind in interstellar exploration."

Austrian Radio Vienna broadcast the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket, its technical data, and detailed information about the rocket's journey to its destination several times on the morning of the 3rd. Vienna's morning newspapers carried the news on the front page with large headlines.

A commentary in Switzerland's "Lausanne Gazette" said that the Soviet experiment aroused particular interest because after the Soviet Union launched its third artificial satellite, it had not announced any new attempts, and some people believed that the Americans had partially made up for their backwardness. The newspaper emphasized that now, the Soviet Union has responded with this achievement.

Belgian radio and television stations broadcast the news continuously early on the morning of the 3rd. People were talking about the Soviet rocket everywhere—in the streets, on trams, in businesses, and on trains. "La Cité" headlined: "After the Americans' attempts failed, the Russians launched a cosmic rocket to the moon yesterday."

On the 3rd, Greek newspapers published special editions reporting new information about the rocket's operation. "Eleftheria" emphasized: "This is one of the most exciting actions of mankind in the twentieth century. For the first time in human history, the cosmic velocity has been exceeded."

Newspapers in Madrid, Spain, also published the news on the front page.

The news of the Soviet Union launching a cosmic rocket spread like lightning to the most remote corners of Japan. All radio and television stations in Tokyo and elsewhere began broadcasting news about the flight of the Soviet cosmic rocket as soon as they began broadcasting the news in the early morning. The news pointed out the huge weight and sophisticated scientific equipment of this new Soviet rocket.

Japanese scientific and cultural workers told TASS reporters that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket is a new and great victory for Soviet science and technology.

Hideo Itokawa, a professor at the University of Tokyo, said that the launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket means that Soviet science has made rapid progress in exploring the universe. He believes that the successful flight of the Soviet interstellar spacecraft is of great significance for studying the universe. He recalled that the United States had tried to launch rockets to the moon more than once, but all had ended in failure.

"Asahi Shimbun" said in an article explaining the lunar rocket that no matter how frustrated the United States is, the successful launch of this Soviet lunar rocket shows that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in the size of rocket propulsion, launch, and guidance technology.

The news of the Soviet Union launching a cosmic rocket to the moon has become the focus of attention in Uruguay. All newspapers in the Uruguayan capital published this news on the front page on the 3rd.

The launch of the Soviet cosmic rocket has become the topic of conversation in bars, streets, and public places. It is generally believed here that the launch of this rocket and the victory of the Cuban people are the two most valuable gifts for the New Year 1959.

    红色宇宙火箭震惊资本主义世界
    许多国家舆论拿来同美国发射月球火箭的失败作对比
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联向月球方向发射宇宙火箭的消息已经轰动了资本主义世界。许多国家各种倾向的报纸都认为这是社会主义国家苏联对人类的巨大贡献。有些报纸把这个消息同美国发射月球火箭的失败作了对比。
    伦敦的各家报纸都以显著地位刊载了关于苏联成功地发射了宇宙火箭——第一个太阳系人造行星的消息。“星期日泰晤士报”的科学记者写道：“我们必须得出的最为重要的结论是：俄国人现在已经有能力向月球发射可以携带人的火箭了”。“星期日快报”说：“全世界正在为俄国发射了第一个完全打破了地球引力障碍的火箭的巨大成就而欢呼”。
      “雷诺新闻”指出，“美国火箭技术大大落后了”。它说，由于苏联最近获得的成就，“杜勒斯所坚持的战争边缘政策的军事基础”已经崩溃了。“每日快报”著名的科学评论员平彻尔写道，苏联在火箭制造方面比美国和英国前进的多得多，他说，“十分明显，在火箭研究的目前阶段，无论是美国人或是英国人都是无法同俄国人相比的”。
    法国公众和报纸以越来越高涨的兴趣注视着苏联向月球方向发射的宇宙火箭的飞行。法国国内和国际消息都排挤到次要地位。在3日的“世界报”和其他晚报上几乎头两版整个排满了有关苏联宇宙火箭的资料和文章。
    “费加罗报”指出，“当美国人非常自信地准备开始这场竞赛时，获得最初胜利的正是俄国人。”
    “世界报”认为，苏联宇宙火箭的发射是“史无前例的成就”。这家报纸在社论中写道：“苏联人在美国人失败的地方取得了胜利”。
    西德各报在报道中强调指出苏联的火箭技术比美国优越。“世界报”写道：“到现在为止，美国已经向月球发出了四枚火箭，可是没有一个达到目的。”
    在意大利，所有报纸都以显著地位刊载了塔斯社关于苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭的消息。资产阶级报纸“报信者报”强调火箭的“巨大体积”。报纸说，苏联向月球方向发射火箭“是人类在星际探险方面向前迈进的一大步”。
    奥地利的维也纳电台3日早晨一连几次广播了关于苏联宇宙火箭的发射情况和技术资料以及火箭向目的地行进的详细消息。维也纳各晨报用大字标题在第一版刊载了这个消息。
    瑞士“洛桑日报”的评论说，苏联的试验引起了特别大的兴趣，因为苏联发射第三颗人造卫星以后，便没有宣布过任何新的尝试，有些人便认为美国人已经部分地弥补了它的落后。报纸强调指出，现在，苏联已经用这个成就作了回答。
    比利时电台和电视台3日一清早就不断广播这个消息。在街道上、电车上、各企业和火车上，人们到处都在谈论苏联火箭。“城市报”的标题说：“在美国人的尝试失败之后，俄国人昨天向月球发射了宇宙火箭。”
    3日希腊各报出版了特刊，报道了火箭运转的新材料。“独立新闻报”强调指出：“这是二十世纪人类最令人兴奋的行动之一。在人类历史上第一次超过了宇宙速度。”
    西班牙的马德里的报纸也都在第一版登载了这个消息。
    苏联发射宇宙火箭的消息像闪电一样地传遍了日本最遥远的角落。东京和各地的所有电台和电视台一清早广播新闻时就开始播送关于苏联宇宙火箭飞行的消息。消息指出了苏联这一新火箭的巨大重量和科学设备的完善。
    日本科学文化工作者对塔斯社记者说，苏联发射宇宙火箭是苏联科学和技术的新的巨大胜利。
    东京大学教授丝川英夫说，苏联宇宙火箭的发射意味着苏联科学在探索宇宙方面得到了神速的进展。他认为，苏联星际航船的成功飞行对研究宇宙有重大意义。他追述说，美国不止一次地企图把火箭射向月球，但都以失败告终。
    “朝日新闻”在一篇解释月球火箭文章中说，不管美国多么懊恼，苏联的这支月球火箭发射成功表明：在火箭的推进力的大小和发射以及导向技术方面，苏联已经领先。
    苏联向月球发射宇宙火箭的消息成为乌拉圭舆论界注意的中心。乌拉圭首都所有的报纸3日都在第一版刊登了这条消息。
    苏联发射宇宙火箭这件事成了酒吧间、大街上和公共场所人们谈话的主题。这里普遍认为，这支火箭的发射和古巴人民的胜利是给1959年新年的最有价值的两宗礼物。
