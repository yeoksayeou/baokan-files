    Minor Differences
    Xiao Min

    Everything has its universality and its particularity. When deploying a task or solving a problem, we must proceed from the overall situation, have unified requirements, and also proceed from the specific reality, treating things differently, which is the combination of the general and the individual.

    The combination of the general and the individual is one of our Party's methods of leadership. The Party and the State's policies, guidelines, and instructions often encounter some complex and specific problems in the process of implementation, especially in a large country like ours, where the development of work varies from place to place, the pace of various tasks varies, and each task has its own characteristics. Moreover, people's understanding is also gradually changing. Therefore, to implement the Party's policies and strive for greater achievements in work, we must proceed from reality, take care of the characteristics of certain regions and certain tasks, combine the general and the individual, and combine unity and flexibility.

    Take education as an example! All schools, without exception, must implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and students must participate in productive labor; this is unified. However, the amount of time students at all levels and types of schools spend on productive labor, and the specific methods, vary depending on the circumstances and conditions of each school. For example, the ratio of teaching, productive labor, and rest time for full-time colleges, middle schools, and primary schools varies depending on the age of the students, and arrangements must be made according to different situations. If it is found that some arrangements were previously inappropriate, adjustments should be made. Many schools are doing this now.

    The general and the individual, unity and flexibility, are dialectical and are a unity of opposites. There is no general without the individual, and there is no individual without the general. The two interact and complement each other. If there is no principle of unified arrangement for the ratio of teaching, productive labor, and rest time in full-time schools at all levels, it will affect the normal progress of the teaching plan. Conversely, if there is only unity, and there is no difference between elementary, middle, and high schools, it will also have adverse effects on the health and physical and mental development of children and adolescents. Therefore, when dealing with our daily work, we must have overall planning and unified arrangements, but also have flexibility; we must have both major similarities and some minor differences.

    The purpose of appropriately arranging the learning, labor, and rest time of schools is to make our work more in line with objective reality and to better combine education and productive labor. From the beginning of work-study programs to the linking of schools and factories, the large-scale establishment of factories and farms, and the mass campaign to produce steel, we have gone through several stages, experienced many experiments, and made many small changes. This is because things are constantly changing, and people's understanding is constantly advancing. We lacked practical experience in combining education and productive labor in the past. Initially, students engaged in some service-oriented labor in addition to participating in industrial and agricultural production and voluntary labor. After a period of exploration, we gained some experience and accumulated some funds, so schools began to establish factories and farms on a large scale, and then schools participated in the national steelmaking movement. The national steelmaking campaign was a national political movement that was related to the economic construction of the entire country. Schools, as members of society, could not stand outside the movement and take it lightly. In the struggle to participate in steelmaking, students' ideological gains were enormous. However, some people, especially those who were originally skeptical and hesitant about the combination of education and productive labor, have recently come out with ulterior motives, saying: You were going too fast in the past! Now you are going too slow! In any case, it does not suit their wishes. In fact, there is no question of fast or slow here. The current emphasis on arranging students' learning, productive labor, and rest time is to better carry out school teaching, productive labor, and scientific research, and to achieve a greater leap forward in education. A Marxist must always make his work conform to objective requirements in order to make the work perfect.

    大同小异
    萧敏
    任何一件事物，都有它的普遍性和特殊性。在布置一项工作或解决一个问题的时候，既要从总体出发，有统一的要求，又要从具体实际出发，有区别的对待，也即所谓一般和个别的结合。
    一般和个别的结合，是我们党的领导方法之一。党和国家的一切政策、方针和指示，在贯彻执行当中，往往要遇到一些复杂、具体的问题，特别是像我们这样一个大的国家，各地工作发展情况不同，各项工作走的步子快慢不同，各项工作又有它本身的特点。而人的认识也在逐步变化。因此，贯彻党的方针政策，争取工作中的更大成就，就要从实际出发，照顾某一些地区和某一工作的特点，使一般和个别相结合，统一性和灵活性相结合。
    就以教育工作来说吧！一切学校都要毫无例外地贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，学生都要参加生产劳动，这是统一的；但是，各级各类学校学生生产劳动的时间多少，各种学校因情况条件不一，具体做法就不完全相同。例如全日制的高等学校、中学和小学，教学、生产劳动和休息时间的比例，因学生年龄不同，就各有差异，就要根据不同情况进行安排。如果发现原来有些地方安排得不适当，要加以调整。现在许多学校正是这样做的。
    一般和个别，统一性和灵活性是辩证的，是对立的统一。没有个别就没有一般，没有一般也就没有个别。两者是相互作用，相辅相成的。全日制学校的教学、生产劳动和休息时间的比例，各级学校如果没有一个原则的统一的安排，就会影响教学计划的正常进行，反之，如果只有统一，大、中、小学没有差别，这对于少年儿童的健康和身心的发育也会发生不良的影响。因此，我们在处理日常工作的时候，既要有全面规划、统一安排，又要有灵活性，既要有大同，又要有一些小的差异。
    把学校的学习、劳动和休息时间加以适当安排，目的是要使我们的工作更合乎客观实际，让教育和生产劳动结合得更好。从勤工俭学开始时起，到学校和工厂挂钩、大办工厂、农场、大炼钢铁，直到最近，其中经过几个阶段，有过许多的试验，也有不少小的变动。这是因为事物在不停地变化，人的认识也在不断地前进。教育与生产劳动相结合，我们过去还缺少实践经验，最初，学生除参加工农业生产劳动、义务劳动以外，还从事一些服务性的劳动；经过一段时间的摸索，有了一些经验，也积累了一些资金，于是学校大办工厂、农场，继而学校参加全民炼钢运动。全民炼钢是全国的政治运动，关系到整个国家的经济建设，学校是社会的成员之一，不能站在运动圈外，等闲视之。在参加炼钢的斗争中，学生的思想收获是巨大的。但是，有些人，特别是原来对教育和生产劳动相结合持怀疑、观望态度的人，最近却别有用心地出来说话了：过去你们走得太快了！现在你们走得太慢了！反正是不合他们的心意。其实，这里并没有快和慢的问题。现在强调提出安排好学生的学习、生产劳动和休息时间，目的是使学校教学、生产劳动和科学研究更好的进行，是为了使教育事业有一个更大的跃进。一个马克思主义者，永远要使自己的工作合乎客观要求，以便把工作做得尽善尽美。
