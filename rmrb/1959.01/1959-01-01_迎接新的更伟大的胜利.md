Whether for China or for the whole world, 1958 was a great turning point. Comrade Mao Zedong's assessment of the situation in November 1957 has been confirmed in the past year.

1958 was filled with disasters for imperialism. The economic crisis that broke out in the United States is spreading to the entire capitalist world. US industrial production in 1958 fell by about 7% compared to 1957, with steel production falling from 113 million tons in 1957 to 84 million tons, a decrease of 25.6%. Industrial production in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany has also declined. Despite the many measures taken by the governments of imperialist countries, the crisis will continue in 1959.

Imperialist countries also suffered heavy political blows in 1958. 1958 was a year of vigorous development for national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The victory of the national revolution in Iraq broke the chains of the Baghdad Pact and pointed out a bright future for the people of the Middle East and the Arab people. US and British imperialism attempted to carry out armed intervention in Iraq, sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan respectively, but were met with unanimous opposition from the people of the Middle East, the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and the peace forces of the world, and had to retreat with their tails between their legs. Subsequently, US imperialism expanded its aggression in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, but also declared failure amidst a chorus of opposition from around the world. The US rulers are in an unprecedentedly isolated position at home and abroad, a situation that has led to a crushing defeat for the ruling Republican Party in the elections. With the economic and political misfortune of imperialism, the contradictions between imperialist countries are growing. The collapse of the European Payments Union served as both a summary of this trend toward disintegration in 1958 and a forecast for 1959.

"It would be foolish to say that the international outlook for 1959 is promising" - so said an editorial in the British Sunday Times a few days ago, looking ahead to the new year.

But for the socialist world, the picture is completely different. 1958 was a year of great leaps forward in the socialist world. The Soviet Union achieved tremendous growth in both industry and agriculture. Soviet steel production will reach 55 million tons, an increase of 4 million tons, from 48% of US production in 1957 to 78.9% in 1958. Soviet coal and wheat production far exceeded the United States and ranked first in the world. Other socialist countries have experienced rapid economic growth. Due to the leaps forward in the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries in 1958, the industrial output of the socialist camp has accounted for about 40% of the world's total industrial output. The solidarity among socialist countries has strengthened, and their prestige among the people of the world, especially among the people of all countries striving for national liberation, has become increasingly high. Not long ago, the CPSU Central Committee announced the control figures for the Soviet Union's national economic development plan for 1959-1965, which is a great inspiration to all progressive humanity: everyone sees that the time is not far off when the socialist world will completely surpass the imperialist world economically. Although imperialism has tried every possible means to provoke friendship between socialist countries and the people of nationalist countries, and even tried to provoke unity among socialist countries, it is ultimately impossible to achieve its goals.

The situation of the imperialist world rotting day by day and the socialist world getting better day by day greatly encourages all people in the world who are striving for peace and love peace. The days of the plotters of new wars are getting worse and worse. Dulles helplessly expressed this feeling in a recent speech. He admitted that the United States "does live in a real whirlwind of changing situations."

China's development in 1958 is one of the important factors that makes Dulles and his ilk feel that "the situation is changing." The past year has been a year of great changes in our country. The great leap forward in socialist economic and cultural construction and the people's commune movement constitute the unprecedented glorious achievements of this year.

According to estimates, on the industrial front, steel production will reach about 11 million tons, more than double that of 1957, only about 8 million tons less than the United Kingdom. Coal production will reach about 270 million tons, also more than double that of 1957, and has already exceeded the United Kingdom's output by about 60 million tons. Machine tools will reach about 90,000 units, three times more than in 1957. Power generation will reach 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of nearly half compared to 1957. The length of railway tracks laid will be about 2,300 kilometers, more than double that of 1957. Cotton yarn production will reach 6.8 million pieces, an increase of nearly half compared to 1957. The total output value of the main products of the 30 light industries other than the textile industry increased by about 50% compared to 1957.

On the agricultural front, grain will reach about 750 billion jin, more than double that of 1957. Cotton will reach about 67 million dan, more than double that of 1957. Oil crops increased by about 50%.

On the cultural and educational front, the number of university students increased by 78% compared to 1957, the number of middle school students more than doubled compared to 1957, and the number of primary school students increased by 43% compared to 1957. Great achievements have also been made in literacy work. The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene has achieved great success. Scientific undertakings and literary and artistic undertakings have also greatly developed.

The people's commune movement has spread throughout the rural areas of the country in the short span of a few months between summer and autumn. The original 740,000 agricultural production cooperatives have formed more than 26,000 people's communes. More than 99% of rural households have joined the people's communes. This is a new development of great historical significance in our country's society.

All these are the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the result of the nationwide rectification movement. The reason why our country's socialist construction has developed at such a high speed is due to the selfless and creative labor of our country's 650 million people, due to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and also due to the rich experience and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

The great leap forward in socialist construction and the people's commune movement in our country in 1958 is a great practice. Through this practice, we have not only found a broad road to building socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, but also gained rich experience on this broad road. This makes it possible for us not only to continue to leap forward in 1959, but also to leap forward even better.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal, has stipulated the guidelines for national economic construction in 1959 and put forward some major indicators.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out that on the basis of the great victory and rich experience in 1958, in the socialist economic construction in 1959, we must continue to oppose conservatism, eliminate superstition, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to implement the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, giving equal importance to heavy industry and light industry, giving equal importance to central industry and local industry, giving equal importance to large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and giving equal importance to foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production. In industry, we must continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, and the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements. In the economic construction of 1959, the whole Party and the people of the whole country must continue to go all out, aim high, and continue to strive for a greater leap forward.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee proposed several major indicators for developing the national economy in 1959: steel will increase from the estimated output of about 11 million tons in 1958 to about 18 million tons, coal will increase from the estimated output of about 270 million tons in 1958 to about 380 million tons, grain will increase from the estimated output of about 750 billion jin in 1958 to about 1,050 billion jin, and cotton will increase from the estimated output of about 67 million dan in 1958 to about 100 million dan. The 1959 national economic plan compiled based on these major indicators will be a magnificent leap forward plan.

Producing 18 million tons of steel in 1959, the absolute amount of the increase (7 million tons) is even greater than that in 1958 (5.65 million tons). From the percentage of growth, it did not reach a double because the base was relatively large. It took the United States six years, West Germany seven years, and the United Kingdom eighteen years to increase steel production from 11 million tons to about 18 million tons. France and Japan have not yet reached the level of 18 million tons of steel. In line with the level of producing 18 million tons of steel in the same year, many industrial products in our country will double in 1959. In view of the tension in transportation and electricity in 1958, the machinery industry in 1959 will actively strengthen the production of machine tools, power generation equipment, and transportation vehicles; at the same time, it will especially strengthen the production of complete sets of equipment and overcome certain weak links existing in the production of supporting equipment. In terms of agriculture, the planned increase in grain production in 1959 is 300 billion jin, reaching 1,050 billion jin, and it is required to appropriately reduce the proportion of sweet potato production and increase the production of wheat, rice, corn, etc. Cotton production should increase by 33 million dan, reaching 100 million dan. Greater increases are required for oil crops, flax, and other cash crops. We must greatly strengthen the production of meat, chickens, ducks, eggs, fish, and various vegetables to meet the huge needs of the national urban and rural population. The entire agricultural production must thoroughly implement the policy of combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, so that the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and rural industries will double.

In line with the situation of continued leaps forward in industry and agriculture, there will be new developments in commercial work and cultural, educational, and health work in 1959.

In 1959, the people's communes across the country will be rectified and consolidated in accordance with the various guidelines stipulated in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The people's commune system will further show its great role in promoting the cause of socialist construction and in organizing people's welfare activities.

Our fundamental purpose of developing production is to meet the needs of the people's material and cultural life. 1959 is still a year of hard work, but on the basis of higher production, the people's lives will be appropriately improved in both urban and rural areas, and the people's time for labor, study, rest, and entertainment will also be better arranged.

The 1959 national economic plan arranged according to the main indicators put forward by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party will be a great leap forward plan, and at the same time a reliable plan built on the basis of objective possibilities. When implementing this plan, we must firmly remember what Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly told us: strategically, we must despise difficulties, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and at the same time, tactically, we must pay attention to difficulties, advocate the spirit of hard work, hard work, and skillful work, advocate practical calculation, arrangement, and inspection, and combine soaring energy with scientific analysis, so that we can be invincible, overcome all obstacles, and leap forward again and again.

As the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session said, "The level of development of our country's productive forces is still very low after all." Our country's industrial products and many agricultural products are particularly so when calculated per capita in our country. Precisely because of this, we still have to continue to work hard and overcome a series of difficulties. But our people fully understand that our situation is rising rapidly, while the situation of imperialism is just the opposite. Precisely because of this, the imperialists cannot but express panic while wantonly slandering and sabotaging us. Like all socialist countries, we are a peace-loving country, our construction is to improve the living conditions of our people, and we do not want to invade or threaten anyone; then, why should the imperialists worry about our progress? What they worry about is that one day they will no longer be able to bully us, and they are afraid that the people of other backward countries will also embark on the road to prosperity and strength, so that the forces of peace and the forces of progress will completely overwhelm the forces of war and the forces of reaction. But this is a great gospel for the people of the world and for the nations striving for independence and freedom, and it is impossible to use it to intimidate any good people. Of course, we must not relax our vigilance against the various sabotage conspiracies of the imperialists, especially the conspiracies to instigate new wars. We must further strengthen our unity with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen our unity with countries and peoples striving for and safeguarding national independence, strengthen our unity with all peace-loving people, smash the imperialists' divisive tricks and war plans, and make unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace.

While carrying out peaceful construction, the people of our country have never forgotten that US imperialism is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and is still continuing to implement an aggressive policy hostile to our country, threatening our country's security. To drive US imperialism out of Taiwan, liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and defend the security of the motherland is the sacred duty of the people of our country.

Before the people of our country are great tasks and great light. Our ranks are united, we have the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, we have the assistance of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union and the sympathy of the people of the world. If we had relatively little experience in 1958, but still achieved an unprecedented leap forward, then, when we have the rich experience of 1958, we will naturally have more and better methods and greater confidence in achieving the new leap forward in 1959. Let us unite as one, together with the people of the world, and strive for new and greater victories in 1959!

    迎接新的更伟大的胜利
    无论就中国说，或者就全世界说，1958年都是一个伟大的转折。毛泽东同志在1957年11月间对于形势的估计，在过去一年中被证实了。
    1958年对于帝国主义充满了灾难。在美国爆发的经济危机，正在向整个资本主义世界蔓延。美国的工业生产1958年比1957年下降7％左右，其中钢产量将由1957年的一亿一千三百万吨降为八千四百万吨，即减少25.6％。英国、法国、西德等国的工业生产都有下降。尽管帝国主义国家的政府采取了许多措施，但是危机在1959年还将继续下去。
    帝国主义国家1958年在政治上也遭到了沉重的打击。1958年是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动蓬勃发展的一年。伊拉克民族革命斗争的胜利，打断了巴格达条约的锁链，为中东人民和阿拉伯人民指出了光明的前途。美英帝国主义企图对伊拉克进行武装干涉，分别出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，遭到了中东人民、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界和平力量的一致反对，因而不得不夹起尾巴走路。接着，美帝国主义又在我国的台湾海峡地区扩大侵略，结果同样在全世界的一片反对声中宣告失败。美国统治者在国内同国外一样陷入前所未有的孤立，这种情况使目前当政的共和党在选举中一败涂地。随着帝国主义在经济上和政治上的倒霉，帝国主义国家相互间的矛盾越来越扩大了。欧洲支付同盟的崩溃，好比替这种走向分崩离析的形势作了1958年的总结和1959年的预告。
    “硬说1959年国际前景有希望是愚蠢的”——几天前的英国星期日泰晤士报社论这样地展望新的一年。
    但是对于社会主义世界，图画却完全是另一种颜色了。1958年在社会主义世界是跃进的一年。苏联的工农业都获得了巨大的增长。苏联的钢产量将达到五千五百万吨，即增加四百万吨，由1957年的占美国的48％变为1958年的占美国的78.9％。苏联的煤产量和小麦产量都远远超过美国而居于世界第一位。其他社会主义国家的经济都有迅速的增长。由于苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家在1958年的跃进，社会主义阵营工业产量已经占到世界工业总产量的40％左右。社会主义各国间的团结加强了，它们在全世界人民中的威信，特别是在争取民族解放的各国人民中的威信，越来越高了。不久以前，苏共中央公布了1959—1965年的苏联发展国民经济计划的控制数字，对于一切进步人类更是一个伟大的鼓舞：大家看到，社会主义世界在经济上完全超过帝国主义世界的时间已经不远了。帝国主义虽然千方百计地企图挑拨社会主义国家和民族主义国家人民之间的友谊，甚至还企图挑拨社会主义国家相互间的团结，毕竟不可能达到目的。
    帝国主义世界一天天烂下去、社会主义世界一天天好起来的形势，大大鼓励了全世界一切争取和平、爱好和平的人们。新战争的策划者日子越来越不好过了。杜勒斯在最近的演说里无可奈何地表现了这种心情。他承认，美国“确实生活在一个形势发生变动的真正旋风里”。
    中国在1958年的发展，是使得杜勒斯之流感觉“形势发生变动”的重大因素之一。过去的一年是我国发生伟大变化的一年。社会主义经济建设和文化建设的大跃进和人民公社运动，构成了这一年的史无前例的辉煌的成就。
    根据预计，在工业战线上，钢的产量将达到一千一百万吨左右，比1957年增加一倍以上，只比英国少八百万吨左右。煤的产量将达到二亿七千万吨左右，也比1957年增加一倍，已经超过英国的产量六千万吨左右。机床将达到九万台左右，比1957年增加两倍。发电量将达到二百七十五亿度，比1957年增加近一半。铁路铺轨里程二千三百公里左右，比1957年增加一倍左右。棉纱产量将达六百八十万件，比1957年增加近一半。除纺织工业以外的三十种轻工业的主要产品的总产值，比1957年增加了50％左右。
    在农业战线上，粮食将达到七千五百亿斤左右，比1957年增加一倍以上。棉花将达到六千七百万担左右，比1957年增加一倍以上。油料增长50％左右。
    在文教战线上，高等学校学生比1957年增加78％，中学生比1957年增加一倍以上，小学生比1957年增加43％。扫盲工作也有很大成绩。以除四害、讲卫生为中心的爱国卫生运动获得了很大成绩。科学事业和文学艺术事业也有很大发展。
    人民公社运动在夏秋之间的短短几个月内已在全国农村普遍发展起来，原有的七十四万多个农业生产合作社已组成二万六千多个人民公社。99％以上的农户都参加了人民公社。这是我国社会有伟大历史意义的新发展。
    所有这些，都是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是全民整风运动的成果。我国社会主义建设事业之所以有这样高速度的发展，是由于我国六亿五千万人民的忘我的创造性的劳动，由于以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明领导，同时也由于有了苏联以及各兄弟国家的丰富的经验和无私的援助。
    1958年我国的社会主义建设的大跃进和人民公社运动，是一个伟大的实践。通过这个实践，我们不但找到了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的康庄大道，而且在这条康庄大道上取得了丰富的经验。这就使得我们不但有可能在1959年继续跃进，而且可能跃进得更好。
    党的八届六中全会根据毛泽东同志的建议，已经规定了1959年国民经济建设的方针，并且提出了一些主要指标。
    八届六中全会指出，在1958年伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，在1959年的社会主义经济建设中要继续反对保守，破除迷信，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，继续实行工业和农业并举、重工业和轻工业并举、中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、洋法生产和土法生产并举的方针，在工业中继续实行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针和集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合的方针。在1959年的经济建设中，全党和全国人民必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，继续争取更大的跃进。
    党的八届六中全会提出1959年发展国民经济的几项主要指标是：钢从1958年的预计产量一千一百万吨左右增加到一千八百万吨左右，煤炭从1958年的预计产量二亿七千万吨左右增加到三亿八千万吨左右，粮食从1958年的预计产量七千五百亿斤左右增加到一万零五百亿斤左右，棉花从1958年的预计产量六千七百万担左右增加到一亿担左右。根据这些主要指标编制的1959年国民经济计划，将是一个宏伟的跃进计划。
    1959年生产一千八百万吨钢，增产的绝对量（七百万吨）比1958年（五百六十五万吨）还要大，从增长的百分比看来没有达到一倍，这是因为基数比较大的原故。钢产从一千一百万吨增加到一千八百万吨左右，美国用了六年的时间，西德用了七年的时间，英国用了十八年的时间，法国和日本一直到现在都没有达到一千八百万吨钢的水平。同年产一千八百万吨钢的水平相适应，我国1959年许多项工业产品都将成倍地增长。鉴于1958年运输和电力的紧张，1959年的机械工业将积极加强制造机床、发电设备和运输车辆的生产；同时将特别加强成套设备的生产，克服目前在配套设备的生产方面存在着的某些薄弱环节。农业方面，1959年粮食的增产量计划为三千亿斤，达到一万零五百亿斤，并且要求适当减少薯类的比重的产量，增加小麦、水稻、玉米等的产量。棉花要增产三千三百万担，达到一亿担。油料、麻类和其他经济作物都要求有更大的增产。必须大大加强肉类、鸡鸭、蛋品、鱼类和各种蔬菜的生产，以供应全国城乡人口的巨大需要。整个农业生产必须贯彻实行农林牧副渔互相结合和工农业同时并举的方针，使林牧副渔各业和农村工业的产值有成倍的增长。
    同工农业继续跃进的形势相适应，1959年在商业工作方面、在文教卫生工作方面，也将有新的发展。
    在1959年，全国的人民公社将根据党的八届六中全会决议所规定的各项方针得到整顿和巩固。人民公社制度将在促进社会主义建设的事业中，在组织人民生活福利的活动中，进一步显出它的伟大的作用。
    我们的发展生产的根本目的，是在满足人民的物质生活和文化生活的需要。1959年仍然是苦战的一年，但是在生产更加高涨的基础上，无论城市和农村，人民的生活都将得到适当的改善，人民的劳动、学习、休息、娱乐的时间也将得到较好的安排。
    根据党的八届六中全会提出的主要指标而安排的1959年的国民经济计划，将是一个伟大的跃进计划，同时又是一个建筑在客观可能性基础上的可靠的计划。在执行这个计划的时候，我们一定要牢牢记住毛泽东同志一再告诉我们的：在战略上要藐视困难，敢想敢说敢做，同时又要在战术上重视困难，提倡实干、苦干、巧干的精神，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查，把冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来，这样我们就可以战无不胜，攻无不克，跃进再跃进。
    如六中全会的决议所说，“我国现在的生产力发展水平，毕竟还是很低的”。我国的工业产品和许多农产品按我国人口平均计算起来，特别是如此。正因为这样，我们仍然要继续苦战，仍然要克服一系列的困难。但是我们的人民完全了解，我们的情况是在迅速地上升着，而帝国主义的情况却正好相反。也正因为这样，帝国主义者在对我们大肆污蔑破坏的同时，不能不表示惊慌。我们同所有社会主义国家一样，是一个爱好和平的国家，我们的建设是为了改善我们人民的生活状况，我们并不要去侵略或者威胁任何人；那末，帝国主义者为什么要为我们的进展而担忧呢？他们担忧的是将有一天他们将不能再欺负我们，而且他们怕其他落后国家的人民也将陆续走上繁荣富强的道路，因而和平的力量、进步的力量将完全压倒战争的力量、反动的力量。但是这对于全世界人民说来，对于全世界争取独立自由的民族说来，却正是一个极大的福音，要用它来恐吓任何善良的人是不可能的。当然，对于帝国主义者的种种破坏阴谋，特别是策动新战争的阴谋是丝毫不能放松警惕的。我们必须进一步加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强同争取和维护民族独立的国家和人民的团结，加强同一切爱好和平人民的团结，粉碎帝国主义的挑拨离间和战争计划，为维护世界和平而作不懈的努力。
    在进行和平建设的时候，我国人民绝没有忘记美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，仍然继续执行敌视我国的侵略政策，威胁着我国的安全。把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，解放台、澎、金、马，保卫祖国的安全，是我国人民神圣的职责。
    在我国人民的面前是伟大的任务，是伟大的光明。我们的队伍是团结的，我们有以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导，我们有以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营的援助和全世界人民的同情。如果说我们在1958年的经验还比较少，但是仍然实现了空前的跃进的话，那末，当我们有了1958年的丰富的经验以后，我们在实现1959年的新的跃进的时候，自然就有更多更好的办法和更大的信心。让我们万众一心，同全世界的人民在一起，为在1959年共同取得新的、更伟大的胜利而奋斗！
