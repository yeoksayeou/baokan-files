Chongren County Universally Establishes Cadre Schools in Various Grassroots Units
Cadres Don't Leave Their Posts, Still Receive Training

(Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch, 28th) In the face of the new situation of guaranteeing the realization of an even greater leap forward in 1959, Chongren County, Jiangxi Province, in order to accelerate the training of rural cadre teams, uses on-site training methods to universally establish cadre schools in various People's Communes, construction sites, factories, and mines, organizing cadres throughout the county to study politics, technology, and culture in conjunction with their current work. This closely integrates cadre training with work, ensuring both the cadres' study time and achieving unity of learning and application, rapidly improving the cadres' political and ideological understanding and work skills, and promoting work. The Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized this experience, considering on-site cadre training to be a method that achieves greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and is promoting it throughout the region's counties.

In the past, Chongren County trained cadres by drawing cadres in separate batches and concentrating them in the county for unified study. This method played a role in the past, but it is no longer fully adapted to the current new situation of the Great Leap Forward. Often, when the county opens schools to train cadres, the cadres are busy with work and cannot be drawn out specifically for study. As a result, in 1958, the county only completed 17% of its cadre training plan. When summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, the Chongren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in conjunction with the above situation, conducted research and believed that the work tasks of cadres in 1959 would be heavier and the time tighter than in 1958. Furthermore, after the realization of communization, cadres still lacked new leadership experience, and they urgently needed to study. Therefore, how to guarantee cadres' study time in 1959 and accelerate cadre training to improve their political and ideological understanding and work skills became a very important task. Based on summarizing past experience, the County Committee researched and presented a method for on-site cadre training. Currently, fifty-two cadre schools have been established in various People's Communes, construction sites, factories, and mines throughout the county, organizing more than three thousand five hundred cadres above the level of production team leader to participate in the study. The content of the study is: in conjunction with the current political movement, studying the Party's principles and policies and basic political theory; in conjunction with current production, studying production technology and cultural and scientific knowledge. The learning method is to combine the three contents of politics, technology, and culture as much as possible, with each lesson focusing on one content as the main center, while the other two contents are also connected and explained together. Debates, on-site visits, and practical operations are organized in conjunction with the classroom content. The study time is generally nine hours per week, that is, three mornings and three evenings. Teachers are selected using the "those who are able become teachers" method, with the County Committee Secretary, ministers, and commune, construction site, and factory and mine Party Committee Secretaries giving political lessons, agricultural technical cadres and advanced technology innovators giving technical lessons, and middle and primary school teachers and cadres with a certain level of cultural knowledge giving cultural lessons. The school facilities are very simple, with some using the canteen as a classroom and others borrowing middle and primary school classrooms. In order to run the cadre schools well, the County Committee has also taken two corresponding measures. First, the County Committee treats cadre training as an important daily task and designates a secretary to be specifically responsible; the Propaganda Department is responsible for regularly inspecting the teaching situation in the cadre schools and helping to solve problems at any time; each school has established a school affairs committee, with a grassroots Party Committee Secretary personally serving as the principal. Second, strengthen tutoring, organize tutoring groups including county cadre school teachers, and travel to various schools to provide teaching guidance and answer difficult questions in learning.

The method of on-site cadre training has been implemented for more than two months and has achieved significant results. After studying, many cadres have rapidly improved their political and ideological understanding and work skills. Because study is conducted in conjunction with current work, cadres have not only rapidly improved their political and ideological level and work skills, but have also learned and applied it to actual work, promoting work. After studying the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," more than 500 cadres in Guanshan and Hangbu Communes improved their understanding of the People's Communes and further improved their leadership methods and work style. The cadres at the Ganghe Reservoir construction site initially lacked confidence in completing the construction of the earth dam before the Lunar New Year. Later, after studying the relevant documents and experiences on how to improve labor efficiency in the cadre school, they improved labor organization, reasonably arranged labor resources, and mobilized the masses to carry out tool reforms. The construction site realized vehicle transportation, and promoted advanced construction methods such as high-altitude soil transportation and blasting for soil extraction. As a result, efficiency increased tenfold and the task was completed one month ahead of schedule.

The Chongren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized the experience of running cadre schools on-site in the previous period, and further adopted measures to consolidate and improve these cadre schools. (Liu Guanghui, Huang Yishi)

    崇仁县在各基层单位普遍建立干部学校
    干部不离职　同样受训练
    本报南昌28日电　在保证实现1959年更大跃进的新形势面前，如何加速训练农村干部队伍，江西省崇仁县运用现场训练的方法，在各人民公社、工地、厂矿普遍建立干部学校，组织全县干部结合当前的工作，学习政治、技术、文化，使训练干部和工作紧密结合起来，既保证了干部的学习时间，又做到了学用一致，迅速提高了干部的政治思想和工作业务水平，推动了工作。中共抚州地委最近总结了这一经验，认为现场训练干部是一种多快好省的方法，向全区各县推广。
    崇仁县过去训练干部是采取分期分批的抽调干部集中到县统一学习的方法，这种方法过去起了作用，但和当前大跃进的新形势，已不完全适应，往往县里开办学校训练干部时，干部工作正忙，抽不出来专门学习。这样1958年全县训练干部计划仅完成17％。中共崇仁县委在总结去年大跃进经验时，结合对上述情况进行了研究，认为1959年干部的工作任务比1958年更重，时间也更紧；再加实现公社化以后，干部还缺乏新的领导经验，他们迫切要求学习；因此1959年如何保证干部的学习时间，加速训练干部，以提高他们的政治思想和工作业务水平，便成了一项十分重要的工作。县委在总结往年经验的基础上，研究出现场训练干部的方法。现在全县各人民公社、工地、厂矿建立五十二所干部学校，组织全县三千五百多名生产小队长以上干部参加了学习。学习内容是：结合当前政治运动，学习党的方针政策及基本的政治理论；结合当前生产，学习生产技术，以及文化科学知识。学习方法是把政治、技术、文化三个内容尽可能地结合起来，每一课以一个内容为主要中心，其余两个内容也连贯一同讲；并结合课堂内容组织辩论、现场参观、实地操作。学习时间一般是每周九个小时，即三个早晨和三个晚上。教师是采取“能者为师”的办法解决，由县委书记、部长和公社、工地、厂矿党委书记讲政治课，由农业技术干部、先进技术革新者讲技术课，由中、小学教师和具有一定文化知识的干部讲文化课。学校设备很简单，有的是利用食堂做课堂，有的是借用中、小学的教室。为了办好干部学校，县委并相应采取了两项措施。一，县委将训练干部工作作为一项重要日常工作来抓，并指定一个书记专门负责；责成宣传部经常检查干部学校的教学情况，发现问题随时帮助解决；每个学校都成立校务委员会，由一个基层党委书记亲自担任校长。二，加强辅导，组织了包括县干校教师参加的辅导小组，巡回到各校进行教学辅导，解答学习中的疑难问题。
    现场训练干部的方法实行两个多月来，效果显著，许多干部经过学习，迅速提高了政治思想和工作业务水平。由于结合当前工作进行学习，干部不仅迅速提高了政治思想和工作水平，而且学到了就运用到实际工作中去，推动了工作。官山、航埠公社五百多名干部经过学习“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”后，提高了对人民公社的认识，进一步改进了领导方法和工作作风。港河水库工地的干部开始时对在旧历年前完成修建土坝的任务缺乏信心，后来在干部学校学习了怎样提高劳动效率的有关文件和经验之后，一面改善劳动组织，合理安排了劳动力，一面发动群众搞工具改革，工地实现了车子化，推广了高空运土、爆破取土等先进施工方法，结果效率提高了十倍，提前一月完成任务。
    中共崇仁县委最近总结了前一段时期现场办干校的经验，并进一步采取措施巩固和提高这些干部学校。　（刘光辉、黄亦石）
