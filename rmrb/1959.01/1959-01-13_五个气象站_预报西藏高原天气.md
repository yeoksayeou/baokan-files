Five Meteorological Stations Forecast Weather on the Tibetan Plateau

Meteorological work on the Tibetan Plateau is rapidly developing.

From New Year's Day this year, five meteorological stations in Lhasa, Shigatse, Lake Bangong, Heihe, and Tsedang have begun issuing long-term, medium-term, or short-term weather forecasts. The remaining meteorological stations located in the northern Tibetan grasslands and the Himalayan mountains will also issue weather forecasts in the first quarter of this year. The "Lhasa Climate Outlook by Ten-Day Period from January to March 1959" issued by the Lhasa Meteorological Station is a valuable reference for various Lhasa agencies, troops, and industrial and mining enterprises in planning their production and work for the first quarter of this year.

Climatic changes on the Tibetan Plateau affect the entire country and Southeast Asia. Mastering the climatic changes on the Tibetan Plateau will increase the accuracy of national weather forecasts. (Attached picture)

The Lhasa Middle School has established a meteorological station, with instruments and equipment provided by the CCP Tibet Work Committee and installed by personnel from the Tibet Meteorological Bureau. This meteorological station has been officially named the Red October Meteorological Station. This is a scene of staff from the Tibet Meteorological Bureau teaching students how to observe meteorological instruments.

    五个气象站  预报西藏高原天气
    西藏高原上的气象工作迅速开展。
    从今年元旦起，拉萨、 日喀则、班戈湖、黑河和泽当等五个气象站已经开始发布长期、中期或短期的天气预报。其余分设在藏北草原和喜马拉雅山区的一些气象站，今年第一季度里也要发布天气预报。拉萨气象站发布的“拉萨1959年1月至3月逐旬气候展望”，对于拉萨各机关、部队和工矿企业在安排今年第一季度的生产和工作，很有参考价值。
    西藏高原上的气候变化，对全国和东南亚地区都有影响。掌握了西藏高原气候变化之后，将会增加全国天气预报的准确性。（附图片）
    拉萨中学建立了一个气象台，仪器设备由中共西藏工委送给并由西藏气象处的工作人员代为安装。这个气象台已正式命名为红十月气象台。这是西藏气象处的工作人员教学生们观察气象仪器的情形。
