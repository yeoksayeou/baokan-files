    Renxian County's Agencies at All Levels Actively Leach Salt and Boil Niter
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Jinnan, 27th] The production and economy movement in Jinnan is becoming widespread and deepening. After mobilization, the Jinnan District Committee agencies saved over 50,000 catties of rice and a surge in production has formed. They are now engaged in spinning thread, making ink, knitting socks, giving haircuts, collecting manure, and cutting grass. Forty-two out of fifty-one cadres from the Fourth Special District Office have participated in production. Four comrades from the Military Committee have started using spinning wheels, and Comrade Zhang Fenglai has planted 200 garlic plants and 200 bean plants. Four comrades have quit smoking, and all comrades voluntarily refrained from taking learning paper, which can save 28,200 yuan in six months.
    The Fourth Team of the Jinnan Cadre School, the entire team saved one tael of rice per person per day from their food rations. Director Chen and others saved half a year's allowance, shoes, socks, single-layer clothing, and rice. Thirty-seven patients, including Yang Zhizhong, saved half a year's worth of shoes, socks, and rice, thirty people quit smoking, sixteen people refrained from buying snacks, and four people exchanged paper cigarettes for dry tobacco. All departments of the Renxian County Party, government, people, and military are actively engaged in production. Ten comrades from the government, including Zhang Jianmin, organized a salt leaching team. They scrape soil before dawn every day. Scraping one pot of soil can yield three catties of salt and three catties of niter, selling for 1,300 yuan. They can scrape at least two pots a day. Some comrades from the County Committee scrape soil and leach salt, while others engage in transportation, hauling goods from Xingjia Gou to Sanhuang Village, earning 20,000 yuan per day. Cadres in the Seventh District of Yuan Dynasty, in order to save civilian labor, stipulated that milling flour and delivering letters are not allowed to dispatch labor, and all outstanding meal chits owed to villages must be cleared. When eating meals in villages, grain coupons must be paid on the spot, and no chits are allowed to be issued. Sixteen people voluntarily contributed their single-layer clothing fees, sock fees, and half a year's allowance of rice to support the front lines.
