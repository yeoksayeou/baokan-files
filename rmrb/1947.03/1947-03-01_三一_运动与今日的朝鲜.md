　　"Long live Korean national independence," "Japanese rulers must all withdraw from Korea"—this was the roar issued by the Korean people, enslaved and groaning under the oppressive rule of Japanese imperialism, twenty-eight years ago today, under the influence and inspiration of the great Soviet October Revolution, against the brutal and despotic Japanese imperialist rulers. At that time, under the leadership and promotion of 33 national representatives, including Sun Bingxi, taking advantage of the opportunity of the state funeral for the Korean "Emperor Guangwu" who was poisoned by the Japanese invaders, they called on the people to rise up and carry out the anti-Japanese restoration movement. More than one million people inside and outside the capital of Seoul declared independence in Pagoda Park; all the Korean people held an oath to resist Japan and restore the country on this day, and organized student parades and demonstrations, shaking the entire capital. At that time, the Japanese invaders used force to suppress, arrest and massacre on a large scale, but the Korean people's independence movement did not end because of this. On the contrary, the movement spread from Seoul to 212 counties in Korea and lasted for a year. Although the "March 1st" Movement failed, it sowed the seeds of revolution among the Korean people. For the past 28 years, they have inherited the revolutionary tradition of "March 1st" and waged a heroic struggle against national enemies and pro-Japanese traitors! Today, with the help of the great friend, the Soviet Union, the Korean people have smashed the enslavement and oppression of the Japanese invaders against the Korean people. However, a tortuous and complicated road of struggle still lies ahead of the Korean people today.

　　Today's Korea has two completely different situations: Since the liberation of northern Korea by the Red Army, the area has undergone a complete change after overthrowing the rule of the Japanese invaders, and the local governments have been transformed into democratic governments. On February 9 last year, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea was elected at the congress of representatives of various democratic parties, public organizations, and provincial and district people's committees, through universal and equal voting. The congress unanimously elected Kim Il-sung, the leader of the national liberation movement, as chairman of the government, and Kim De-bong as vice chairman. In November last year, the election of the North Korean People's Committee (autonomous assembly) was held again. As a result of the election, the National Democratic United Front won a great victory, with party representatives accounting for the most seats, and the people of the whole country warmly celebrated the success of this election.

　　In South Korea, the situation is completely opposite: Although the Japanese invaders have surrendered, they have not been disarmed politically, economically, or spiritually. At the beginning of the occupation, the US military maintained the Japanese colonial rule institutions intact. Not only were the Korean traitors not eliminated, but they maintained the same status they had during the Japanese rule. There are also those so-called "provisional government" exiles, such as Kim Gu, Zhao Suang, and Kim Kyu-sik, who returned from Chongqing, and Li Seung-man, who returned from the United States via Chongqing, who, with the support of the US military authorities, established a reactionary regime. In November last year, the US military authorities, in collusion with the Korean reactionaries, also played a trick of so-called "national and local elections" in South Korea. After visiting the election, Mr. Gay, a reporter from the Chicago Sun, came to a fair conclusion: "These elections are very undemocratic."

　　In North Korea, democratic reforms have been carried out in various aspects, and the people have obtained extensive democratic and free rights. Gender equality has appeared in the Korean Constitution for the first time. Various democratic organizations are very active. In Pyongyang alone, there are 18 central committees of trade unions in various industries, and the "Workers' Daily" is published. More than 30 kinds of democratic newspapers are published throughout the north, reflecting the demands of the people. All schools have resumed the use of their national language and writing, and have begun to eliminate illiteracy. In terms of economy, major factories and mines have started operations, and many small and medium-sized enterprises have already begun to be established. Reasonable food rationing and wage standards have been established in factories, and an eight-hour working day has been implemented. The land reform was completed in May and June last year, enabling landless peasants and poor peasants to obtain 963,657 hectares of land. The people's lives have been greatly improved, and they sincerely thank and support the People's Committee, which represents the interests of the people.

　　Let us take a look at the situation in South Korea under the occupation of the US military. The people have no freedom, and the political situation is pitch black. The US military authorities and Korean reactionaries collude with each other and set up various police and spy networks, including political police, traffic police, and special women's police. During the "May 1st" Labor Day workers' parade and demonstration last year, these agents used various despicable means of division, surveillance, and intimidation, and conspired to sabotage the event. Four days before the anniversary of the Red Army's liberation of Korea and defeat of Japan on August 18 last year, the reactionary US occupation authorities began large-scale illegal searches of democratic people in Seoul. The Seoul Garrison Command even searched the private residence of Kim Seo-ryong, the political director of the People's Party, falsely claiming that "a large amount of information about the US military was found hidden." At that time, a spokesman for the Korean Communist Party pointed out: "This is the act of a rogue spitting blood, which fully shows the darkness of the political situation in South Korea. This action is the beginning of the anti-democratic and anti-people collusion between the US and Korean reactionaries." Sure enough, when the people of Ronam Province held a parade and demonstration with 300,000 people participating in Gwangmyeong City on the anniversary of the Red Army's liberation of Korea, 1,140 miners were intimidated by US military aircraft and tanks on their way to Gwangmyeong City, and then shot by Korean police and US troops in American uniforms. At the same time, six US aircraft also strafed with machine guns, killing and wounding 20 people on the spot. However, this policy of terror cannot deter the Korean people. The heroic miners continued to step forward. Immediately following this incident, a wave of popular resistance against the US-Korean authorities and their assassination politics was launched in the US military-occupied area of South Korea. Starting with the strike by miners and railway workers on September 23 last year, it was followed by a general strike of sympathy by workers on major railway lines in the south, and an alliance strike by seamen, electrical, and food enterprise workers. The peasants in the south also cooperated with this movement, supporting their worker brothers, and launched a movement against rent and taxes. The strike continued until October. In the area of Osan, south of Seoul, armed conflicts broke out between railway workers and police, and more than 20 people were killed or injured in total. In addition, farmers in Gyeongsang Province launched riots and continued to expand. The US occupation army dispatched more than 1,000 military police, carrying tanks and artillery, and bloodbathed the villages of the insurgent farmers. At the same time, university professors and students also went on strike and stopped attending classes to protest against the various crimes of US imperialism and the US military's insulting of female students, and accused Kim Gu of betraying the country. The US occupation army declared martial law on October 7 and assisted the Kim Gu puppet government in adopting a high-pressure policy, and carried out large-scale searches and arrests of democratic parties and social organizations, as well as workers, peasants, youth, and students in various cities. Lee Eom-guk, the secretary-general of the Korean Democratic Front, and Communist Party secretaries Du Xi-young and Lee Jeong-guk (all transliterations) were arrested by the US military. A spokesman for the Democratic Front solemnly pointed out: The Korean people have a tradition of resistance. They did not succumb to Japanese fascism in the past, and they will not be intimidated by any high-pressure policies in the future. Yes, we are also convinced that the Korean people, who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered country and had persisted in a tenacious struggle, were able to liberate themselves from the enslavement of Japanese invaders, and will also be able to achieve complete national independence, freedom, and liberation through their own struggle from the oppression of US imperialism and its lackeys!

　　“三一”运动与今日的朝鲜
    施缝
    “朝鲜民族独立万岁”、“日本统治者群一概由朝鲜撤退出去”—这是廿八年前的今天被奴役呻吟于日寇暴政压迫之下的朝鲜人民，在伟大苏联十月革命胜利的影响和鼓舞下，向暴戾专横的日本帝国主义统治者所发出的怒吼。当时，在民族代表孙秉熙等三十三人的领导和推动下，趁朝鲜“光武皇帝”被日寇毒杀举行国葬的机会，号召人民起来进行反日复国运动。京城内外群众不下百余万人，在塔洞公园发表独立宣言；全朝鲜人民在这一天举行反日复国的宣誓，并组织学生游行示威，震撼了整个京城。当时日寇使用武力镇压大肆逮捕与屠杀，但朝鲜人民独立运动并未因此告终，相反的是运动却由京城波及到朝鲜的二百十二县，持续了一年之久。“三一”运动虽然是失败了，但是它在朝鲜人民中间却播下了革命的火种，二十八年来，他们继承着“三一”的革命传统，向民族敌人与韩奸卖国贼进行了壮烈的斗争！今天朝鲜人民在伟大友人苏联的帮助下，粉碎了日寇对朝鲜人民的奴役和压迫，但是，今天放在朝鲜人民面前的还仍是一条曲折而复杂的斗争道路。
    今天的朝鲜，存在着两种完全不同的情况：被红军解放的朝鲜北部自推翻日寇统治后，面貌已焕然一新，各地政府已经过改造而成为了民主政府。去年二月九日，在各民主党派、公共团体、省和区人民委员会的代表大会上，以普遍平等的投票，选出了鲜北临时人民委员会，大会一致选举民族解放运动的领袖金贻荪为政府主席，金德邦为副主席。去年十一月间，又举行了鲜北人民委员会（自治议会）大选。选举结果，全国民主联合阵线大胜，议席中以党派代表为最多，全国人民曾热烈庆祝这次选举的成功。
    而在朝鲜南部，情况是完全相反的：日寇虽已投降，但在政治、经济和精神上仍未解除武装。美军在占领之初，曾原封不动的保留日本的殖民地统治机构，韩奸不但未除，而且保持着他们在日寇统治时代的同样地位。还有那些所谓“临时政府”的流亡人士，如由重庆回国的金九、赵素昂、金奎植和从美国转道重庆回国的李承晚之流，在美军当局扶持下，建立起反动政权。去年十一月间，美军当局联合朝鲜反动派，还在鲜南玩了一套所谓“全国选举与地方选举”的把戏。美国芝加哥太阳报记者盖氏参观了这次选举后，得出了一个公正结论：“这些选举是很不民主的”。
    在朝鲜北部已进行了各方面的民主改革，人民已获得广泛的民主自由权利，男女平等已在朝鲜宪法上第一次出现了。各种民主组织非常活跃，各行业的职工会仅平壤一地即有十八个职工中央委员会，出有《工人报》。整个北部出有三十余种民主报纸，反映出人民的要求。所有学校都已恢复使用本国语言及文字，并已着手扫除文盲。在经济上，各大工厂与矿山都已开工，许多中小企业早已开始建立。工厂中建立了合理的粮食配给与工资标准，并实行八小时工作制。土地改革在去年五六月间就已完成，使无地农民及贫农得到了九十六万三千六百五十七公顷土地，人民生活大大改善了，他们热诚地感谢与拥戴代表人民利益的人民委员会。
    我们再看看，在美军占领下的朝鲜南部的情况又是怎样呢？人民毫无自由，政局一团漆黑。美军当局与朝鲜反动分子狼狈为奸，设立了各种警察与特务网，有政治警察、交通警察、和女子特别警察等。这些特务在去年“五一”劳动节工人游行示威时，曾施行各种分化、监视、威吓的卑劣手段，阴谋破坏。去年八月十八日红军解放朝鲜击败日本一周年纪念的前四天，反动的美占领军当局便开始在汉城大规模非法搜查民主人士，汉城警备队更搜查人民党政治部长金瑞荣私邸，诬称：“发现藏有大批有关美军的情报”。当时，朝鲜共产党发言人即指出：“这是含血喷人的无赖汉的行径，十分表明朝鲜南部政局的黑暗。这种行动是美韩反动派勾结的反民主反人民的开始”。果然，当红军解放朝鲜一周年纪念日，罗南道人民在光明城举行有三十万人参加的游行示威时，有一千一百四十名矿工在来光明城的途中，即遭受美军飞机坦克的恐吓，继而遭到穿着美国服装的朝鲜警察与美军一起开枪射击，同时六架美机亦以机枪扫射，当场死伤二十人。但这种恐怖的屠杀政策是吓不退朝鲜人民的，英勇的矿工们继续挺身前进。紧接着这个事件，在朝鲜南部美军占领区掀起了广大人民反抗美韩当局及其暗杀政治的浪潮，以去年九月二十三日矿工铁路工人的罢工为起点，接着就有南部主要铁路干线工人的同情总罢工，和海员电气、食品企业工人的同盟罢工。南部农民也配合着这个运动，声援工人兄弟，展开了抗租抗捐的运动。罢工至十月还继续着，汉城南面鸟山一带，铁路工人与警察发生武装冲突，双万死伤二十余人。此外，庆尚道南农民发动暴动并继续扩大，美占领军竟出动一千余名军事警察，并携带坦克大炮，血洗起义农民的村落。与此同时，大学教授及学生亦纷起罢教罢课，抗议美帝国主义种种罪行和美军侮辱女学生事件，并控诉金九卖国。美占领军于十月七日宣布戒严，协助金九傀儡政府采取高压政策，在各城市大肆搜捕民主政党与社会团体，及工农青年学生等。朝鲜民主阵线总书记李俨国，共产党书记杜西英，李正谷（均译音）均遭美军拘捕。民主阵线发言人严正地指出：朝鲜人民素具反抗的传统，过去既不屈服于日本法西斯，今后更不会为一切高压政策所慑服。是的，我们也如此确信：不愿做亡国奴而曾经坚持着顽强斗争的朝鲜人民既能从日寇奴役下解放出来，同样能够从美帝国主义及其走狗的压迫下，以自己的斗争求得民族的完全独立自由和解放！
