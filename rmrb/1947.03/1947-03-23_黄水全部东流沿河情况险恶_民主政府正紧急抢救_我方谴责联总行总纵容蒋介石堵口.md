    [Reported by our newspaper's correspondent in the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 21st] The Yellow River has entirely returned to its old course, reaching a depth of over two zhang (approximately 20 feet). Currently, the Yellow River rushes eastward, and in areas such as Changyuan and Juancheng, the river has widened to three li (approximately one mile), with the water level rising to the riverbanks. This historically notorious "hanging river" situation is extremely perilous. Riverbed residents in villages such as Xiaotun and Helou in Juancheng County were submerged by the Yellow River due to the overwhelming force of the water, and they were unable to relocate in time. Residents are homeless, and their situation is extremely miserable. The residents along the river are panic-stricken and turn pale at the mention of water. The democratic government here has taken emergency measures. Despite the harassment of Chiang's troops and planes, it is still able to overcome all difficulties and actively carry out rescue efforts. Currently, the people of Fan County, Pu County, and Shouzhang County are braving the bombing and strafing of Chiang's bandits to repair river embankments and preparing to plant willow stakes on the dikes along the river to strengthen the defenses. It is estimated that 800,000 willow trees are needed from Changyuan to Qihe embankment, costing a total of 15 million Jilu-Yu currency (equivalent to 160 million Chiang currency). They are also actively collecting stones to rush the repair of dangerous sections and intensify rescue work.
    [Reported by our newspaper's correspondent in the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 21st] People from Zhengzhou said: This time, Chiang Kai-shek violated the agreement and released the water by blocking the breach at Huayuankou ahead of schedule, which was completed under the direct design of American engineers. Around the 10th of this month, the breach was sometimes blocked and sometimes breached. Just when the Kuomintang authorities were at a loss, a certain American technician designed to use iron wire to weave five-cubic-foot iron wire cages, fill the cages with stones, and drag them into the Huayuankou breach, finally blocking the Huayuankou on the 15th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] According to the Associated Press Shanghai report on the 19th: The representative of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee stationed in the UNRRA China Office recently issued a written statement on the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, which stated: According to a Central News Agency dispatch, the Huayuankou in Henan was finally blocked on March 15, and the river returned to its old course. The statement condemned the UNRRA and the CNRRA for violating the solemn agreement and allowing Chiang's side to release water before the residents of the old course were relocated. The government, UNRRA, and CNRRA must be responsible for all consequences. The statement demanded the immediate allocation of funds for the dike construction project and the resettlement expenses for the residents of the old course.

    黄水全部东流沿河情况险恶
    民主政府正紧急抢救
    我方谴责联总行总纵容蒋介石堵口
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一电】黄水已全部流入故道，深达两丈余。目前黄波滚滚奔向东流，长垣、鄄城、等地黄水已宽达三里，水势上涨至堤岸，此历史上有名之悬河，情况极为险恶。鄄城县小屯、贺楼等村河床居民，因水势太猛，未及迁移，已被黄水淹没，居民无家可归，状极凄惨。沿河居民，人心惶惶，谈水变色。此间民主政府已采取紧急措施，虽在蒋军及蒋机袭扰下，仍能排除万难积极抢救。现范县、濮县、寿张等县之民夫冒蒋贼之轰炸扫射，抢修河堤，并准备在沿河大堤上栽柳桩，以固堤防。估计从长垣至齐河堤上，需植柳八十万株，共需冀钞一千五百万元（合蒋币一万六千万元），并积极搜集石料，赶修险工，加紧抢救工作。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】郑州来人谈：此次蒋介石违背协议，提前在花园口堵口放水，系在美工程师直接设计下完成者。本月十日前后，口门尚时堵时决，正当国民党当局无计可施时，美方某技师即设计用铁丝编成五立方尺之铁丝笼子，笼内填满石头，拖入花园口口门，终于十五日将花园口堵死。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据美联社上海十九日消息：中国解放区救济委员会驻联总中国办事处代表，顷为黄河归故问题发表书面声明，内称：根据中央社讯，河南花园口终于三月十五封口，河流归入故道。声明谴责联总与行总违反庄严协定，在故道居民移居前即允蒋方放水，一切后果政府、联总与行总必须负责。声明要求立即拨付聚堤工程费及故道居民的迁移安顿费用。
