[This report from the Jilu-Yu area on the 10th] After Zhangdaizhuang in Yanggu County finished distributing land, the entire village, old and young, rejoiced. Groups of people discussed their liberation: "My three mu of land will be great for planting millet!" "Look at my three mu; even if it doesn't yield a stone of wheat, it will yield eight dou." Wang Cunxing was even more delighted; he originally had three mu of land, and this time he was given another three mu based on his landholding. He boasted, "We're adding land without adding borders; you couldn't buy this with gold beans." Jia Ruiting, a model peasant who had turned the tables, went to see his newly returned land in the west of the village early in the morning before eating. He felt an unspeakable joy in his heart. Then, he planned: this year he will plant three mu of sorghum, two mu of millet, and also plant some pumpkins. He thought of his past; when the traitor was around, because he couldn't afford the money, the puppet village chief Zhang Xinzhi took him to the city and took over his five mu of land. Recently, when Zhang Xinzhi was struggled against, he actively gave his opinion. He told the reporter, "My five mu of land is back; my anger is gone. Even if I get sick and die today, I, Jia Ruiting, will be worth it." The peasants in the whole village who got land enthusiastically thanked the Communist Party. They had already bought three feet of red silk to make a plaque to send to the Yanggu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Jia Ruiting had studied for a few days when he was young. He spent two days thinking and came up with two poems to write on the plaque: "We plant our own land, we are willing to put in more effort, every grain of food belongs to ourselves, we are happy to get up early and go to bed late." "Mother gave birth to me, father raised me, landlords and bullies bullied me, the Communist Party led me to turn the tables, strike down Chiang Kai-shek, and may we have clear skies for ten thousand years."

　　阳谷张岱庄分完田
    农民作诗庆翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】阳谷张岱庄分完了地以后，全村老少喜成一片，三五一堆的纷纷谈论翻身：“我分的那三亩地种谷子可好哩！”“看我那三亩，种麦收不了一石也收八斗。”王存兴更是高兴，原有三亩地，这次靠着他的地又分给他三亩，他倒自夸：“咱添地不添边，用金豆子也买不到啊。”翻身模范贾瑞亭在分到地以后，清早起来没吃饭便跑到村西头去看那块才回家的地，心眼里说不出的痛快；他接着就计划：今年种上三亩高粱，二亩谷，还得点上些金瓜。他想到他的过去，汉奸在时，因为拿不起款，伪乡长张信之把他押到城里，又把他的五亩地霸占了。最近斗张信之时，他积极提了意见。他向记者说：“我的五亩地又盼回来啦，气也出啦，就算今天得病死了，俺贾瑞亭也值得啦。”全村得到地的农民都热烈感谢共产党，已经买了三尺红绸子做成一个匾，送给阳谷中共县委会。贾瑞亭小时念过几天书，他品味了两天的工夫，想出来两首诗写到匾上“自己得种自己田，多出力气也心甘，粒粒粮食归自己，早起晚睡心欢喜。”“娘生俺，爹养俺，地主恶霸欺负俺，共产党领导的俺把身翻，打夸蒋介石，晴天万万年。”
