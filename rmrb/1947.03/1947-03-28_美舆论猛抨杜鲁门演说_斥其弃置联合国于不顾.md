Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. TASS, New York: The *Capital Times* of Madison, Wisconsin, published an article commenting on Truman's speech, stating: "Truman's proposal to interfere in Greek and Turkish affairs constitutes a historic departure from traditional American foreign policy and fundamentally alters President Roosevelt's policy of seeking lasting peace through collective cooperation under the United Nations; this is blatant power politics." The newspaper pointed out that this power politics, supported by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, means disregarding the United Nations. The United Nations was established to deal with serious situations like that of Greece. The *Capital Times* believes that Congress should reject Truman's proposal and that the Greek and Turkish issue should be submitted to the United Nations for resolution. Grafton, a columnist for the *New York Post*, wrote: "We are paving the road to Athens with humanity's shattered hopes." *New York World-Telegram* commentator Stokes stated: The United States is now being tested because it has not submitted the problem to the United Nations, which it led in creating. An afternoon newspaper commentator pointed out: The United States Congress, while using free enterprise as a slogan domestically, demands control of Greece's economy on the other hand.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS, New York: US Senators and Representatives are currently receiving a large number of letters from constituents expressing deep anxiety about the proposals made by Truman in his address to Congress. The majority of letters from constituents in the eastern states strongly criticized the United States for disregarding the United Nations. Senator Saffus stated that he received 3,300 letters, the vast majority of which opposed Truman's proposal. Newspapers continue to receive many letters on this issue. The *New York Times* published a letter on March 19 from the former head of the Balkan Strategic Services, White, criticizing the Anglo-American policy of not encouraging the democratic aspirations of the Balkan peoples but continuing to support the Balkan reactionaries. The *Washington Post* published several letters from Puritans on March 21, stating that the Puritans opposed replacing food with guns. The *Minneapolis Star* wrote: Former Minnesota Governor Benson stated that Truman's proposal was hypocritical, and the interventionist policy would support reactionaries and the interests of American oil companies in the Mediterranean.

    美舆论猛抨杜鲁门演说  斥其弃置联合国于不顾
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：威斯康星州麦迪逊城的《首府时报》刊载评论杜鲁门演说之论文称：“杜鲁门干涉希土事务之建议，造成了具有历史性的对美国传统外交政策之叛离，及基本地改变了故罗斯福总统拟定的通过联合国集体合作行动而争取持久和平的政策；这是粗暴的强权政治。”该报指出，此种为参院外委会主席范登堡所支持的强权政治，意味着弃置联合国于不顾。而联合国之建立，就是为了处理类似希腊的严重情势的。《首府时报》认为，国会应否决杜鲁门之建议，希土问题应提交联合国解决。《纽约邮报》专栏作家葛拉夫顿撰文称：“我们正在以人类被破坏了的希望来铺平通达雅典的道路。”纽约《世界电讯报》评论员斯托克斯称：美国现在正受到考验，因为他没有将问题提交由他领导创建的联合国。下午报评论员指出：美国国会一方面在国内使用自由企业作为口号，而另一方面却要求控制希腊的经济。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美参众议员刻正接获大量选民来信，对杜鲁门向国会演讲中提出之建议表示深刻之焦虑。大部分东部各州的选民来函都强烈抨击美国置联合国于不顾。参议员萨夫斯称，他接到三千三百封信，其中绝大多数反对杜鲁门之建议。各报继续收到关于此一问题的很多函件，纽约时报三月十九日发表前巴尔干战略服务处首脑白之函件抨击英美不鼓励巴尔干人民的民主愿望反继续支持巴尔干反动派的政策。华盛顿邮报三月二十一日发表若干清教徒的来函，声称清教徒们反对以枪炮代替食物。明尼阿玻利斯明星报写道：前明尼苏达州长宾生声称，杜鲁门建议是伪善的，干涉主义政策将支持反动派与美国石油公司在地中海上的利益。
