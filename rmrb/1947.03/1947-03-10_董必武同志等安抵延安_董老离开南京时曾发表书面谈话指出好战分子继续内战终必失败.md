　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Dong Biwu, representative of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanjing, along with Hua Gang, Pan Zinian, Wang Bingnan, Chen Jiakang, Mei Yi, and other staff members (74 in total) remaining in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as some personnel remaining in Chongqing, who were forced to withdraw from the Chiang-controlled areas, arrived safely in Yan'an on the afternoon of the 7th. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Chairman Lin, Deng Yingchao, and other responsible comrades of the Chinese Communist Party went to the airport to welcome them, shaking hands and expressing their regards to the comrades who had persevered in their work in the Chiang-controlled areas. When leaving Nanjing, Dong Biwu issued a written statement, the original text of which is as follows:

　　“I and others are forced to leave this place today, and my feelings are indescribable. The connection between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has never been broken in the past ten years, has now been severed by the warmongers of the Kuomintang! This move of theirs is clearly an attempt to cooperate with the reorganization of the government, to win open and large-scale assistance, to encourage the declining morale at the front, to stabilize the wavering hearts of the rear, and to cruelly persecute the increasingly fierce democratic and patriotic movement. Foreign friends of the warmongers also seem to think it is worth a try. The civil war will obviously continue, and the disasters of the people will be even greater and deeper. However, this great adventure, which stakes the lives of millions upon millions of people, is bound to fail because it violates the wishes of all peace-loving people. The warmongers will eventually reap the bitter fruit of their own actions, and their Chinese and foreign friends will regret it too late. Although the war is spreading, we Communist Party members will continue to strive for peace and democracy as we have always done. At this moment of parting, I and others would like to share this with all peace-loving and democratic people across the country.”

　　董必武同志等安抵延安
    董老离开南京时曾发表书面谈话指出好战分子继续内战终必失败
    【新华社延安八日电】中共驻京代表董必武暨留京、沪工作人员华岗、潘梓年、王炳南、陈家康、梅益等七十四人，及留渝一部分人员被迫撤离蒋管区，已于七日下午安抵延安。朱总司令、刘少奇、周恩来、林主席、邓颖超等中共负责人俱赴机场欢迎，对坚持蒋管区工作之同志一一握手慰问。董必武离京时，曾发表书面谈话，原文如下：
    “必武等今日被迫离此，感慨莫名。十年来，从未断绝之国共联系，今已为国民党好战分子一手割断矣！彼等此一举动，显然企图配合政府之改组时，争取公开大量援助，借以鼓励前方颓落之士气，镇定后方动摇之人心，并残酷迫害日见猛烈之民主爱国运动。好战分子之中外友人，似亦认为不妨一试，内战显将继续，人民之灾祸必将更大更深。然而，此种以千百万人性命为赌注之极大冒险，因其违反全体爱好和平人民之愿望，终必失败无疑，好战分子行将自食其恶果，彼等之中外友人亦将后悔莫及。目前虽战祸蔓延，我们中共党员仍将一本初衷，竭力为和平民主奋斗到的。当此握别之际，必武等愿以此与全国一切爱好和平民主人士共勉。”
