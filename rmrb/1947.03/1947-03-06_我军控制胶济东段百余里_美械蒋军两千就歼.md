Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: Over two thousand one hundred men of the American-equipped 15th Traffic Police Corps, composed of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, have been completely annihilated. After the East China People's Liberation Army recovered Yexian and Changyi in the Jiaodong area from the 18th to the 22nd of last month, annihilating over three thousand Chiang soldiers, they counterattacked the Chiang soldiers entrenched in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway on the 28th. After a night of fierce fighting, they captured all ten-odd strongholds and stations along the hundred-odd li section from Gualingtun (50 li southeast of Weixian) to Caizhuang (50 li northwest of Gaomi), and continued to expand to both the east and west ends. In this battle, a total of over one thousand five hundred men, including the battalion commander of the traffic police corps and below, were captured alive, over six hundred were killed or wounded, and eighteen American-made artillery pieces and over seven hundred and seventy various types of machine guns and rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: The East China People's Liberation Army successively withdrew from the Jinpu railway line of central Shandong, Yexian and Qufu county seats on February 27th and 28th. The invaders of the above two cities were Chiang’s 11th Reorganized Division and Wu Huawen's puppet troops entrenched in Yanzhou.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Weixian, a famous industrial and commercial city in Shandong, is on the verge of bankruptcy in various industries after Chiang’s army forcibly occupied and plundered it. Twenty-four of the city's thirty flour mills have been shut down. The famous Huade Paint Factory, Xinfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Nanxin Foreign Firm, and Meifeng Machinery Factory have all been occupied by Zhang Tianze, the commander of the 1st Shandong Security Division of Chiang’s puppet army. Most merchants have been forced to close down or reduced to peddlers under the pressure of over forty types of donations and taxes. Yang Taichang, which has been open for more than forty years, was also forced to close down, and the Kuomintang even forced it to pay 100,000 yuan in legal tender for closure fees. The goods and capital of a merchant surnamed Wang in Dongguan were squeezed dry, and Wang died of grief and indignation. The Chiang’s tax bureau then levied an inheritance tax of 600,000 yuan. General peddlers are forced to pay 20,000 yuan in stall donations every month, and even the commercial giant Ding Chuyan committed suicide by poison due to a debt of 4 billion.
