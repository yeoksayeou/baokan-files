The Taihang Third Special District Promotes Hundred-Day Textile Campaign
    Women in Various Counties Compete for Meritorious Service
    Licheng and Pingshun Spark Mutual Challenges Between Individuals, Groups, and Villages
    [This Newspaper's Report] Since the Taihang Third Special District issued the call for a hundred-day textile campaign, various counties have gradually moved from mobilization and planning to action. First, various localities used calculations and examples for comparison to break down various ideological obstacles. For example, in Jinqu Village, Licheng, the calculation of 42 struggle targets in the entire base point clarified that it was not "struggling against the rich" nor aimless struggle, which stabilized the emotions of households "afraid of struggle." After in-depth discussions in the first district of Changzhi, the ideas of women "relying on men for food" and "lacking enthusiasm for spinning for the public" were broken down. The villages along the river in Lucheng broke down the complacent idea of being satisfied with farming three days and having one day of leisure, and having money to buy cloth, before they set up the looms. Secondly, problems such as tools, technology, and raw materials have also been largely resolved. For example, the Changzhi County Cooperative, after half a month of efforts, established a tool factory with more than 30 workers in Guancun, and set up a spinning training class in Liuling Village. In Zizhen, the second district of Lucheng organized 290 carpenters to make textile tools. The newly transformed "four-shuttle" loom in Lijiazhuang is much more stable and less prone to breaking threads than the two-shuttle loom. Pingshun and Licheng are generally making large spinning wheels and two-wheeled spinning wheels. Pingshun aims to achieve one loom for every four spinners, Licheng calls for one loom per team, and Lu and Hu call for the transformation of old machines to spin wide cloth, greatly increasing production. Under the call to improve quality and increase production, various counties have consciously launched a meritorious service campaign. For example, in Qiushuyuan in Licheng, Shixia in Pingshun, and other villages, individuals, groups, villages, and cooperatives are challenging and competing with each other. The Pingshun County government has also decided to hold a small-area textile exhibition on March 8th and a county-wide exhibition on the 24th. In addition, places like Guancun in Changzhi have adopted the experience of Beiliu, with cadres dividing up responsibilities and women spinning during the day and holding meetings at night, resolving the contradiction between organization and emancipation. Currently, most of the spinning wheels and looms in the district have been activated. Shaobiao in Changzhi produces 27 jin of thread and 483 chi of cloth in one day. Based on the current situation, to rapidly develop the movement, two problems must be solved: First, the concept of getting rich through textile production must be clearly established among cadres and the masses, overcoming the task-oriented view. For example, Pingshun proposed "If you want to get rich, weave cloth and spin cotton." Second, the new districts must solve the problem of combining textile production with emancipation.

　　太行三专区推进百日纺织
    各县妇女竞赛立功
    黎城平顺掀起个人与个人、组与组、村与村相互挑战
    【本报讯】太行三专区自提出百日纺织号召后，各县已由动员、订计划，逐渐走向行动。首先各地用计算、实例对比等办法，打破各种思想障碍。如黎城靳曲村从计算全基点四十二户斗争对象中，明确了不是“斗富”也不是瞎斗，安定了“怕斗”户的情绪。长治一区经过深入讨论打破妇女“靠男人吃饭”、“给公家纺没劲”等想法。潞城沿河各村是打破了满足于耕三余一，家里有钱买布穿的自满思想后，才把布机安起。其次对工具技术、原料等问题，也大体解决，如长治县联社，经过半月努力，在关村成立了一个拥有三十余名工人的工具厂，并在柳岭村设纺训班。潞城二区在子镇组织了二百九十个木匠制纺织工具。李家庄、新改造的“四辆梭子”比二辆梭用起来平稳的多，不怕拉断线。平顺、黎城普遍做大纺车、二轮纺车。平顺要达到四个纺妇一架布机，黎城号召一个小组有一架布机，潞、壶号召改造旧机，纺宽面布，产量大为提高。在提高质量产量的号召下，各县自觉开展了立功运动。如黎城秋树垣，平顺石匣等村，个人与个人、组与组、村与村、合作社与合作社、互相挑战竞赛，平顺县府并决定三八节举行小区纺展，二十四日举行全县大展览。此外如长治关村等地接受北流经验，干部分工负责，妇女白天纺织，黑夜开会，解决了组织与翻身的矛盾。现本区纺车织布机已大部发动，长治杓暴一天即产线二十七斤，布四百八十三尺。就目前情况、要使运动迅速发展，必须解决两个问题：一、在干部群众中明确树立纺织发家观念，克服任务观点。如平顺提出“要想发家、织布纺花”。二、新区必须解决纺织与翻身的结合问题。
