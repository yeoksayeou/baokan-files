    Military Direct Individuals Save 60,000 Jin of Millet
    [This Newspaper News] The individual savings movement in units directly under the military region has formed a mass upsurge. Forty staff members of the reception office saved 12 single garments, 13 single trousers, and multiple pairs of shoes, socks, and towels. The Special Service Company of the Guard Regiment saved 104 towels, 59 pairs of shoes, 19 pairs of socks, and 17 and a half sets of single garments. All the soldiers of the Fifth Company requested to save their annual subsidy of millet. The superiors estimated that they had difficulties and did not allow it. They then wanted to save shoes, towels, etc., saving a total of 77 towels, 7 pairs of shoes, and one and a half sets of single garments. Individual savings in the headquarters amounted to 8,841 jin of millet. Up to now, the entire direct unit has saved single garments, single trousers, shoes, towels, etc., totaling more than 60,000 jin of millet. (Mei Ling)
    [Another News] Production and savings have not only formed an upsurge in the various organs of the Central Bureau, but all production personnel in the Central Direct Store are also consciously responding. On the evening of February 3rd, the general store automatically convened a mobilization meeting to discuss savings. Managers Liu and Jia, and Supervisor Song, all voluntarily proposed: Save one jin of millet every day, receive three chi less of native cloth every month, and other personnel responded one after another, formulating individual savings plans with great enthusiasm. A seventeen-year-old employee, Zhang Qingfu, proposed to voluntarily save 30 jin of millet per month (his monthly salary is only 40 jin, food is separate). Currently, 26 of the 32 people in the general store voluntarily save, totaling 4,980 jin of millet and 180 square chi of native cloth per year, worth about 217,200 yuan. They also utilize the spare labor of those who are often at home (such as accountants, cashiers, cooks, and orderlies) to reclaim wasteland and plant cotton and vegetables. In order to overcome deviations, everyone formulated four production discipline rules and established a production and savings committee to take charge of leadership.
    In addition to rewarding the store staff for responding to the Party's call and voluntarily engaging in production and savings, the Central Bureau Administration Bureau also raised the following three points to encourage them: 1. As a production unit, the store should focus on its daily business and actively complete its tasks. 2. Take care of the lives of the members. Give them the profits they deserve and do not require them to be like cadres. 3. Streamline the organization, save on various expenses, and expand the amount of dividend distribution. (Cui Xi)

    军直个人节约达小米六万斤
    【本报讯】军区直属队个人节约运动形成群众热潮。招待处四十个工作人员，即节约单衣十二件、单裤十三条及鞋、袜、毛巾等多件。警卫团特务连，节约毛巾一百零四条，鞋五十九双，袜十九双、单衣十七套半。五连的全部战士要求节约全年津贴米，上级估计他们困难，没有允许，他们又要节约鞋、毛巾等，共节约了毛巾七十七条，鞋七双，单衣一套半。司令部个人节约即达米八千八百四十一斤。截至现在为止，全直属队共节约单衣、单裤、鞋、毛巾等共合米六万余斤。（梅岭）
    【又讯】生产节约不仅在中央局各机关已形成热潮，中直商店所有生产人员也自觉的响应。二月三日晚，该总店自动召开动员大会，讨论节约。刘、贾经理、宋监委都自动提出：每天节约一斤小米，每月少领三尺土布，其他人员纷纷响应订出个人节约计划，情绪至为热烈，一位十七岁的雇员张庆福，提出自愿每月节约小米三十斤（他月薪才四十斤，火食另外），现该总店三十二人中有二十六人自动节约，计全年小米四千九百八十斤，土布一百八十方尺，合钱约二十一万七千二百元。并利用经常在家人员的闲余劳动力（如会计、出纳、厨司、勤务等），开荒地种棉花蔬菜等农作物。为克服偏向，由大家订出生产纪律四条，又成立生产节约委员会，以掌握领导。
    中央局管理局除奖励该店工作人员响应党的号召自动进行生产节约外，并提出以下三个问题，加以勉励：一、商店为生产机关，更重要的是抓紧日常业务，积极完成任务。二、照顾社员生活。给予应得利润，不能和干部一样要求。三、紧缩机构，节省各项开支，扩大红利分配额。（崔玺）
