　　Resourceful, Courageous, and Caring for Soldiers;
    Company Leader Shi Caipeng Has a Great Leadership Style
    Shi Caipeng was only promoted last August to serve as the platoon leader of the first platoon in the seventh company of the "50" unit. Although his time in the position is not long, he has developed an excellent leadership style. Caipeng often says, "The higher-ups promoted me to be a platoon leader to lead a platoon to fight battles and eliminate the enemy, not to play around with people's lives; it's not enough to be brave myself and want to eliminate the enemy, if it doesn't reduce casualties in the platoon." In directing combat within the platoon, besides charging ahead himself, he can carefully observe and study the terrain and choose the path of attack. During the ZhaoJiaChang battle at the beginning of the year, the seventh company was assigned to be the main attacking force, with the first and second platoons charging forward, led by Caipeng. They captured a machine gun and six rifles, with only two people slightly injured. In the FangLan battle, the first platoon was tasked with the attack. Shi Caipeng first observed the path of the charge and measured the terrain. He realized that the reason why the × platoon could not charge up the bunker and suffered casualties was mainly because there was a small open area in front that was difficult to cross. He surveyed the surrounding area again and chose a more concealed path on the right side, launching a sudden attack. In one fell swoop, they charged into the enemy's bunker, capturing all the enemies and setting a large bunker on fire. Shi Caipeng deeply understands that to defeat the enemy, it is necessary to harness the courage of every soldier, so he pays close attention to political encouragement on the battlefield, able to put forward powerful slogans at any time and place. When attacking ZhaoJiaChang, two soldiers were injured, and he shouted loudly at the front: "Comrades, we are like brothers in ordinary times, now we have to avenge them!" When the second platoon was charging at FangLan, he immediately proposed: "Let's win a good reputation for our 50th unit!" which boosted the soldiers' courage a hundredfold. Shi Caipeng usually cares about the lives of the soldiers. During marches and encampments, he always personally checks whether each soldier has straw bedding, has drunk boiled water, and has washed their feet. The soldiers affectionately call him "the old housekeeper." (Taihang Branch)

　　智勇双全关心战士
    师才朋领导作风好
    师才朋是去年八月才提拔起来到“五○”部任七连一排长的。工作时间不长，他在领导上却有一套优良作风。才朋常说：“上级提拔我当排长，是叫我领导一排人去打胜仗，消灭敌人，不是拿人命开玩笑；单凭自己勇敢，想消灭敌人，不能减少排里的伤亡也不行”。他在排里指挥作战上，除自己冲锋在前，还能细心观察研究地形、选择冲锋道路。年初赵家厂战斗时，七连担任主攻，一二排打冲锋，由才朋带领，缴获机枪一挺，步枪六支，仅有两个挂彩号。方兰战斗中，第一排打冲锋，师才朋首先观察了冲锋道路，经过了地形测量，他看到×排不能冲上碉堡和伤亡的原因，主要是前边有一小片开阔地难以冲过。他又向周围调查了一遍，选择了右侧一条较隐蔽道路，来了个猛冲，一家伙便冲进敌人碉堡，将敌全部俘虏，同时把一座高大碉堡放火烧毁。师才朋深知要战胜敌人，总得发挥每个战士的勇气，所以他很注意战场政治鼓励工作，能随时随地提出有力口号。打赵家厂时，两个战士负了伤，他在前头高声喊叫：“同志们，咱们平素像亲兄弟一样，现在得给他们报仇呀！”打方兰二排冲锋时，他马上提出：“给咱五○部争个好名气”！提高了战士们百倍勇气。师才朋在平时关心战士生活，行军宿营，他每次都要亲自看过每个战士是否有了铺草、喝上开水和洗脚没有。战士们亲爱的称呼他“老当家”。（太行分社）
