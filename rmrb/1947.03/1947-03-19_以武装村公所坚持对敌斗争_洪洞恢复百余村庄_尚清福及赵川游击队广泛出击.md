　　Using Armed Village Governments to Persist in the Struggle Against the Enemy
　　Hongdong Recovers Over a Hundred Villages
　　Shang Qingfu and Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Teams Launch Extensive Attacks
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] Hongdong is actively fighting the enemy with armed village governments as the center, and 112 villages have returned to the control of the democratic government, estimating 79% of the county's 142 villages. Many "maintained" villages, supported by armed forces, have severed the connections forced upon them by the enemy. The armed village governments are combined with militia groups. For example, villages such as Shi Village and Fan Village are combined with Shang Qingfu's Flying Explosives Team, cooperating internally and externally to completely smash the Jiang-puppet organization's conspiracy of "maintaining" and plundering. Once, a special agent secretly sent out over 20 shi of wheat, which was confiscated by the armed village government after it was discovered. When the land reform started in the Second District, the armed village government and militia groups took the initiative to surround the strongholds of Hanlue and Subao, and forced the enemies in Hanlue to retreat, allowing the villages to carry out land reform safely. Under this kind of struggle, the masses' morale was boosted, and they scrambled to organize armed forces. The local people's armed forces have increased more than threefold. Now this kind of armed village government is advancing towards the Jiang-puppet strongholds.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] The Hongdong guerrilla warfare with Shang Qingfu Flying Explosives Team as its core is extremely active. On the 4th, Shang Qingfu and others captured two people, including Xue Zilong, the deputy head of the Fenxi National Military Regiment of the Yan faction, on the Fengzhang West Highway, and seized five large boxes of American-made cigarettes and more than 800 jin of brown sugar. On the same day, the enemy from Subao came out to harass, stepping on two landmines near Yibi, causing four casualties. The team also harvested more than 800 jin of electric wires near Quting. On the 18th of last month, the team repelled a retaliatory encirclement of 400 enemies near Shi Village. Under the influence of Shang Qingfu, the militias in various districts have universally launched a campaign to serve the people. On the 13th of last month, two companies of Jiang's army from Hongdong invaded Yong× Village in the east of the city. The militia in the First District ambushed the enemy in the village and repelled them. On the 15th of last month, twelve militiamen in the Third District attacked the Jiang's Runqiao stronghold two miles south of the city and captured four stubborn Fenxi county government staff alive. The militia explosive team in the Second District planted landmines in Xialu Village, three miles away from the enemy Subao stronghold, killing and wounding three Jiang soldiers.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] The military and civilians in Southern Fen are carrying forward the tactics of the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Team, "the enemy advances, we advance; surprise wins," and are launching extensive attacks, making the once-silent guerrilla warfare in Southern Fen active again. In the forty days from the 15th of last month to the 4th of this month, they killed, wounded, and captured more than 400 Jiang-puppet troops. The Ji Lu Guerrilla Team has broken through the blockade and returned to the grid of Ji Lu.

　　以武装村公所坚持对敌斗争
    洪洞恢复百余村庄
    尚清福及赵川游击队广泛出击
    【本报太岳十七日电】洪洞以武装村公所为中心积极对敌斗争，已有一百一十二个村庄复归民主政府掌握，估全县一百四十二个村庄的百分之七十九。许多“维持”村得到武装的支援，纷纷打断被敌人强迫的连系。武装村公所与民兵集团相结合，如师村、范村等村与尚清福飞行爆炸队结合，内外配合斗争，完全击碎蒋伪组织“维持”与掠夺的阴谋。曾有一特务偷送出廿余石麦子，被武装村公所发觉后予以没收。二区开始土地改革时，武装村公所与民兵集团即主动向韩略、苏堡各据点围困，并把韩略敌人逼退，各村安然进行了土地改革。在此种斗争下，群众情绪振奋，争先组织武装，该地人民武装已增至三倍以上。现此种武装村公所正向蒋伪据点推进中。
    【本报太岳十七日电】以尚清福飞行爆炸队为核心的洪洞游击战争极为活跃。四日，尚清福等在冯张西公路上活捉阎属汾西国民兵团副团长薛子龙等两名，缴获美造纸烟五大箱，红糖八百余斤，同日苏堡之敌出扰，在伊壁附近踏向地雷两颗伤亡四名。该队并曾于曲亭附近收割电线八百余斤。上月十八日，该队在师村附近击退敌四百余人的报复包围。各区民兵在尚清福影响下普遍展开为民立功运动。上月十三日洪洞蒋军两个连向城东永×村进犯，一区民兵在该村设伏，将敌击退，三区民兵十二人于上月十五日攻入城南二里敌润桥据点，生俘顽汾西县府工作人员四名。二区民兵爆炸队在离敌苏堡据点三里之下鲁村埋设地雷，毙伤蒋军三名。
    【本报太岳十七日电】汾南军民发扬赵川游击队“敌进我进，出奇制胜”的战术，广泛出击，使一度沉寂的汾南游击战争又形活跃。从上月十五至本月四日的四十天内，杀伤俘蒋伪军四百余人。稷麓游击队已突过封锁线，打回稷麓格子网内。
