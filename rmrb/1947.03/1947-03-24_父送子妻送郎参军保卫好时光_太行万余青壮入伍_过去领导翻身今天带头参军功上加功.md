[By our correspondents from Shahe, Xiangyuan, Wu'an, Cixian, Xingtai City, etc.] Reports indicate that as of the 16th, the number of young people from the aforementioned counties and cities who have voluntarily joined the army has reached over 15,400. Shahe has 5,083 new recruits; Cixian has over 4,900; Wu'an has reached over 3,500; in Xiangyuan, 1,220 people registered for enlistment in two days. In the Fourth District, over 180 people enlisted in one day and one night, and in the Fifth District, 121 came from Xiying alone. When enlisting in the First District, there were many exemplary cases of parents sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers vying to enlist. Liang Shunqing, a veteran from Shangfeng Village, voluntarily re-enlisted and swore not to return until old Chiang was defeated. In Xingtai City, 335 people registered; Chen Yulin, an old man and chairman of the People's Association of Wenmiao Street, enthusiastically toasted the new soldiers with a wine pot. When he reached his son, Chen Xiaoshang, he said passionately: "Xiaoshang, we have been poor all our lives, and we have only just turned the tables. You must protect the good land we have been allocated! As your father, I toast you with this cup of wine for enlisting. You must defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." Young teachers Song Lin and two others also registered. A 13-year-old student wrote him a letter saying: "I hope you defeat Chiang Kai-shek soon and come back to teach us." A martial arts expert who enlisted from Dian City Street showed off his skills at the send-off rally, leaping over a wall seven or eight feet high. He said: "Now that we have turned the tables, I want to show my skills and make contributions to the people. Even empty-handed, I will seize a machine gun in battle." In the Eighth District of Cixian, 16 old party members sent their sons to join the army. In Nantou Village, Ninth District, model military dependent Old Mrs. Dai sent her third son to the front line. She said: "Big and Little Er have both joined the army. Now I am sending my third son to the Eighth Route Army. Protecting the good times is our own business. If our own people don't step forward, who else can we rely on?" In the Fourth District of Wu'an, 17 village cadres volunteered to join the army during a district meeting, including five cadres from Xujiapo. These cadres have made many contributions to the masses in leading the village to overturn their lives. Today, they are leading the way in enlisting, defending the fruits of their liberation, adding merit upon merit. The leadership officially announced on the spot that these 17 comrades would each be awarded a major merit, and the merit would be transferred to the army unit. Their exemplary actions influenced over 700 liberated young people in the entire district to compete to register for the front line. In Nanfengchang Village, fathers sent sons, wives sent husbands, and brothers sent brothers, with 51 young people going to the front line at once. In the Third District, under the slogan "Join the counter-offensive army to make contributions for the people," 17 good young people, including Shen Dianyu, enlisted. In the Eighth District, under the slogans "Dig up the root of misfortune" and "Join the army to have a good life; we will not return home until we defeat old Chiang," over 300 young people registered in three days, and many exemplary stories emerged. In Tanling Village, a child registered for the army, and the village head told him that he was too young and should go later. He said unhappily: "If I wait any longer, the stubborn troops will be all killed!" Some who were rejected due to their young age cried bitterly. Everyone believes that this is a good time to go to the front and make contributions. Zhao Sizi, a worker in the district, also voluntarily registered and went to the front line. The wave of enthusiasm for joining the army is continuing to spread in all counties of the region.
