Mass Training of Over Ten Thousand Activists
Shexian County Conducts Another Review

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 12th] According to reports from comrades Luo Jing and Bai Luke of the Shexian County Party Committee: The land redistribution movement in the county has largely concluded, and the entire county has basically achieved "those who have not, receive." Currently, over ten thousand middle-aged and old activists are undergoing mass training to ensure the smooth conduct of the final review movement. The land reform movement in the county began in December of last year, and by the Lantern Festival, it shifted from a high tide to in-depth inspections. The inspection methods were as follows: First, short-term training classes for village cadres and activists were held, organized by district or basic village units, to summarize the movement and inspire their class consciousness and leadership (democratic work style). Returning to the villages, they became the main force for in-depth inspection. Second, better cadres and activists from key villages were organized to conduct cross-village inspections. Third, district cadres personally went deep among honest peasants for door-to-door visits to identify problems. This method also proved very effective. Through widespread and in-depth inspections, the main problems discovered were: 1. The landlords were not thoroughly liquidated. In some cases, the landlords were left with too much, such as in Shangsi Village in the Seventh District, where a large landlord only had a portion of his land liquidated, and a large amount of property was untouched. In other cases, there was no liquidation at all, such as in Zhaishang Village in the Ninth District, where two landlords were classified as middle peasants and not liquidated, and in Qiuzi Yu in the Third District, five landlords and one landlord in Zhao Yu were treated as rich peasants. In Yinhejing Village in the Fourth District, cadres shielded landlords, using fake liquidation to fool the masses. 2. The fruits of the revolution were still not distributed fairly. First, the cadres received more and better shares, often under the pretext of "according to merit" or "system-based rewards." For example, in Qianzhai Village in the Third District, one household, with three brothers all serving as cadres, received particularly preferential shares. The eldest brother received a shop and courtyard; the second brother got half a shop; and the third brother exchanged for the landlord's courtyard. This created opposition between cadres and the masses, allowing landlords to exploit the situation. Second, the distribution of fruits among the masses was unfair. Backward masses received less, mountain households received less, military dependents received less (those serving in the army were not counted in the population), and lazy people received less (because they were disliked). This situation affected forty-two households in Dachun Village and twenty-one households in Chengguan. Third, the preservation of fruits was unclear. Some had not been fully distributed, some were intentionally left (such as good houses reserved for the village public office or cooperative), and in Taipingzhuang in the Ninth District, the amount left reached 200,000 yuan. Some village cadres were corrupt, and many villages did not list the fruits, leaving them unclear. 3. A considerable number of "backward" masses had not yet been liberated. These people were ideologically unawakened, preserving property for landlords, pitying landlords, fearing change, and daring not to ask for fruits. Village cadres looked down on them, giving them less or no fruits. 4. Lack of unity within the peasantry, manifested as contradictions between cadres and the masses, between activists and the backward, and between middle peasants and poor peasants. Also, some large tenant farmers (those who had previously rented the most land from landlords) returned too little land, causing dissatisfaction among everyone. After twenty days of vigorous inspection, by late February, the land redistribution was largely completed. According to statistics from one hundred and thirteen villages (four villages are missing from the county): peasants recovered a total of over 39,000 mu of land, over 31,000 rooms, over 1,600 head of livestock, over 90,000 shi of grain, over 30,000 pieces of farm implements, over 357,000 silver dollars, over 17 million Jichaos, over 11,700 taels of silver, and various furniture and clothing. During the distribution of fruits, the slogan "Level the extreme poor, supplement the poor peasants, and take care of the middle peasants" was put forward based on the principle of leveling and compensating. All 2,199 households in extreme poverty were raised to the level of middle peasants, with an average of more than 2.1 mu of land per person. All 8,752 poor peasant households were also raised, with an average of 1.9 mu of land per person (compared to an average of 1.5 mu before the movement). The broad masses of middle peasants also received fruits. In order to thoroughly realize land reform, the county held a county-level cadre meeting in late February, deciding to conduct another review, setting the following goals: 1. Thoroughly liquidate landlords, eliminate extreme poverty, and distribute the fruits completely and rationally. 2. The masses are truly ideologically awakened, dare to ask for fruits, and actively engage in production. 3. Form a strong leadership group composed of new and old activists. 4. The masses are greatly united and can defeat the landlord's counterattack. In terms of methods, villages were divided into three categories: 1. Backward villages (35 in the county), mainly relying on hired laborers and poor peasants as the backbone to mobilize the broad masses, transform cadres, and completely resolve outstanding issues. 2. General villages (83), where backward elements should be united in the village, and advanced elements should mobilize the backward. 3. Advanced villages (95), where outstanding issues should be resolved quickly, and efforts should be fully shifted to production. In order to be quick and effective, over ten thousand new and old activists are being trained across the county, as the main force of the movement. County and district leaders must let the masses do the work with a free hand, provide focused guidance, and strive to completely complete land reform throughout the county by the end of March.

　　普训万余积极分子
    涉县再次进行复查
    【本报太行十二日电】据涉县县委罗晶、白鲁克两同志报导：该县填补运动已大体结束，全县基本上实现了有其出，现正普训中老积极分子万余人，俾能顺利进行最后的复查运动。该县土地改革运动于去年十二月开始，至元霄节，即由高潮方向深入检查，检查方式有以下三种：一种以区或基村为单位，召开村干部与积极分子短期训练班，总结运动，启发其阶级自觉与领导（民主作风）自觉。回村成为深入检查的主力；一种是以基点各村较好干部与积极分子，组织村与村交换检查：再一种是区干部亲自深入老实农民中进行挨户访问，发现问题，这办法收效亦大，经普遍深入检查，发现的问题主要有：一、地主清算的还不彻底。其中有的是给地主留的东西太多，如七区上寺村一大地主，只清算了其一部土地，大量财物未动；有的是根本未经清算，如九区寨上村查出二个地主划成中农而未清算，三区秋子峪五个地主，赵峪一地主均按富农处理；四区银河井村干部包庇地主，用假清算哄过了群众。二、果实仍未公平分配。首先是干部分的多、分的好，其借口多是：按功劳，按系统得奖励。如三区前寨村一户，兄弟三人均为干部，分的特别优厚，老大分了铺子院；老二得了半个店；老三换了地主的院子。由此造成干部与群众的对立，使地主有机可乘。其次是群众间果实分配不公。落后群众分的少，山上户分的少，军属少分（参军者不计算人口），懒汉少分（讨厌他们）。此种情形，达村即有四十二户；城关有二十一户。再次是保存果实不清底。有的还未分完、有的，意留下（如给村公所合作社留好房），九区太平庄留的竟达二十万元。有的村干部贪污，不少村庄果实未列清单，不明不白。三、相当数量的“落后”群众仍未翻身。这些人思想不觉悟，给地主保存财产、可怜地主、怕变天不敢要果实，村干部轻视他们，少给或不给分果实。四、农民内部不团结，表现为：干部与群众、积极与落后、中农与贫农的矛盾，还有一些大佃户（过去租种地主土地最多的）退出土地太少，大家不满。经过二十天的大力检查，至二月下旬，全县填补大体完成，据一百一十三个（全县缺四个村）村统计：农民共收回土地三万九千余亩，房三万一千余间，牲口一千六百余头，粮食九万余石，农具三万余件，银洋三十五万七千余元，冀钞一千七百余万元，碎银一万一千七百余两，及各种家具衣服等。果实分配时，依填平补齐原则提出：“填平赤贫，补齐贫农，照顾中农”的口号。二千一百九十九户赤家全部上升为中农，每人平均地二亩一分以上；八千七百五十二户贫农，也均上升，每人平均地一亩九分（运动前不均一亩五分），广大中农亦分得果实。为了彻底实现土地改革，该县于二月下旬召开县级干部会，决定再来一次复查，提出奋斗目标中一，彻底清算地主、消灭赤贫、全部的合理的分配果实。二、群众思想真正觉悟、敢要果实、积极从事生产。三、能形成新旧积极分子组成的有力的领导集团。四、群众大团结，能打垮地主的反攻。在做法上，分三类村：一、落后村（全县有三十五个），主要是以雇贫为骨干，发动广大群众，改造干部，彻底解决遗留问题。二、一般村（八十三个），村里在落后层，应团结先进发动落后。三、先进村（九十五个），迅速解决遗留问题，全力转入生产。为了迅速有效，全县分区训练新旧积极分子万余人，作为运动的主力，县区领导，要放手让群众干，有重点的指导，争取三月底全县彻底完成土地改革。
