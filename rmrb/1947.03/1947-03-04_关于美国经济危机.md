　　On the American Economic Crisis
　　Recently, we have received letters from comrades at the Party School, An Pei, and many other readers, raising questions about the American economic crisis. Here are comprehensive answers for your reference.

　　First question: What has been the history of economic crises in the United States?

　　Like other capitalist countries, due to the contradiction between the private ownership of the means of production and the social nature of production, the United States inevitably experiences an economic crisis every certain period (approximately ten years). From 1873 to the present, seven crises have occurred along with world economic crises. The first was 1873-74, the second was 1883-85, the third was 1890-92, the fourth was 1907-08, the fifth was 1920-21, the sixth was 1929-32, and the seventh was 1937-39. In each crisis, production declined significantly, unemployment was widespread, wages were drastically reduced, prices plummeted, trade stagnated, and stock market prices fell sharply. The most severe and profound was the one in 1929-32. Varga and economists from around the world believe that the severity of the American economic crisis expected to arrive this year and next year will be similar to or even exceed that one.

　　The 1929-32 American economic crisis was also the largest and most severe in the world's general crisis. At that time, the production of various basic industrial sectors in the United States regressed to the state of 25 to 40 years earlier. The industrial production in 1932 was even 47.2% lower than in 1929, when the crisis just began. Only 13% of the steel smelting equipment was used, and only 11% of the automobile manufacturing machines were used. The national wealth in 1931 was only 240 billion US dollars, a decrease of 40% compared to 400 billion US dollars in 1929. At the peak of the crisis, 17 million American workers were unemployed (equal to half of the total number of workers in the country). In 1932, the total wages paid to workers by American capitalists were only 33% of what they had been before the crisis. Everywhere on the American continent, one could encounter groups of people, young and old, carrying furniture, searching for work. Many people searched for discarded leftover food in garbage dumps, and suicides occurred almost every day. Tens of thousands of farmers were also ruined. The wholesale price of wheat dropped by 70%, and the prices of cotton, sugar, coffee, and wool dropped by more than half. Agricultural capitalists burned stockpiled grain, letting it rot, or threw it into the sea. Milk was also poured into rivers in large quantities to make the market "prosper." In terms of import and export trade, the import volume in 1932 was 70% lower than in 1929, and the export volume was the same. 31,882 enterprises went completely bankrupt. The credit crisis caused banks on Wall Street to collapse one after another, and stock prices plummeted by 75%...

　　Second question: What is the basis for predicting the American economic crisis?

　　First, looking at the most important indicators of a crisis—overproduction and a sharp decline in purchasing power—according to Varga's statistics, the current productivity of the United States is more than double that of the pre-war period. The inventory of military supplies after the war is worth 100 billion US dollars, and there are enough machine tool lathes for ten years. Currently, the inventory of wholesale and retail goods exceeds 340 billion US dollars, and it is increasing by 10 billion US dollars every month. A large quantity of potatoes is also being prepared for burning. The military and ordnance factories expanded during the war account for one-third of all factories before the war, and their conversion to peacetime industries is very difficult. As for the 524 billion war profits earned by American financial magnates during the war, there is no way out. On the other hand, according to a recent report by Yuri Zhukov, a reporter for Pravda, the broad masses of the American people have begun to fall into poverty. "The height of price increases in the past five months is equal to the height of increases in 50 months during the war," and 80% of American workers are living below the subsistence level. According to research by the University of California, the minimum living expenses for an American to support a family of four is $2,964 per year, but in fact, 70% of the American people do not have this minimum capacity. Truman announced that five million Americans are homeless. Even if large places are organized, 750,000 people cannot find houses and are wandering the streets. The number of unemployed last year exceeded 4 million, as did the number of strikers, breaking the record for strikes in American history.

　　Second, from the contradiction between the United States concentrating world wealth and the shrinking world market. The United States has concentrated 80% of the world's total gold reserves, about 30 billion US dollars, becoming the creditor of many countries. However, because most of this wealth is concentrated in the hands of financial oligarchs, it has become the basis of the reactionary foreign policy of the United States. As a result, it is difficult for American wealth to be digested in the world market to obtain greater capital reaccumulation. Because after this World War, many new democratic countries have emerged in Europe. Although they also urgently hope to obtain foreign investment to accelerate domestic development, they are absolutely unwilling to accept American financial aggression. The Soviet Union is also not unwilling to receive American assistance in economic construction. However, the die-hard anti-Soviet faction of American imperialism destroyed the mutually beneficial path of US-Soviet trade. Such a large market as China has also been destroyed by the reactionary policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war. Some conservatives in Britain have already begun to show anti-American tendencies in order to maintain the imperial market. These contradictions cannot be overcome by American imperialism. The increasing growth of these contradictions is increasingly shrinking the world market of the dollar empire and accelerating the arrival of the economic crisis.

　　Third, from the decline in stock securities. In highly developed capitalist countries, the stock market is the economic barometer, and its rise and fall indicates prosperity and recession. A decline to a certain low level is a signal of an economic crisis. According to Varga's statement in November last year: "The total value of American industrial stocks fell from 840 billion US dollars in mid-May to 650 billion US dollars. Historical experience proves that such a sharp drop often begins about 12 to 18 months before the arrival of an economic panic, because the tycoons of the financial oligarchy, who are well-informed, have begun to fear the arrival of the crisis and sell off stocks and securities."

　　Third question: Who are the important figures among American monopoly capitalists, and what is their influence?

　　Who are the important figures among American monopoly capitalists, and what is their influence? If you want to understand this in detail, you can refer to Zhang Jisheng's translation of "American Capitalists." Here, I can only give a brief introduction:

　　The total number of American monopoly capitalists, large and small, is no more than 500. They monopolize more than 60% of American wealth, and the largest of these families are only 64. Among them, the wealth of the Rockefeller and Morgan groups alone amounts to more than 93 billion US dollars, accounting for one-third of all American corporate property. Next, the strength of Mellon, DuPont, Ford, etc. is also considerable. (This is still pre-war statistics; there has been no accurate survey after the war.) Currently, the eight major financial groups (Mellon, DuPont, Rockefeller, Morgan four families, Kuhn Bank, Cleveland, Chicago, and Boston) control 175 of the 200 leading companies in the United States, and control most of the newspapers, news agencies, radio companies, magazines, etc. in the United States (excluding various progressive newspapers and magazines). The population of all American financial magnates is less than 1% of the total population of the United States, but they dominate 99% of the American people economically and politically.

　　Fourth question: What methods do American monopoly capitalists attempt to use to escape the economic crisis?

　　American monopoly capitalists, on the one hand, are creating an impending economic crisis, and on the other hand, they also want to get rid of the shackles of the crisis. In the past, they used war to escape economic panic, but now it is impossible, because the 1950s are already an era of people's revolution. The Soviet Union, new democratic countries, and the democratic forces of the world are growing stronger, and the awareness and the power of unity and struggle of the American people are also growing. Although the American financial tycoons are still subjectively fantasizing about completely shackling the economic crisis on the necks of the American people, and even seriously preparing for the so-called "new war," Stalin has already concluded for them: "I do not believe in the actual danger of a new war." Therefore, in the context of the increasing growth and strength of the world's progressive forces for peace and democracy and the increasing development of the American people's democratic movement, the American financial oligarchs cannot escape the impending economic crisis, but will only move towards decline and the grave.

### 关于美国经济危机

1947-03-04
第3版()
专栏：时事问答

　　关于美国经济危机
    最近我们收到党校、安培同志，及许多其他读者来信，提出些关于美国经济危机的问题，兹综合答复如下，以供参考。
    第一个问题：美国历史上的经济危机情形如何？
    美国如同其他资本主义国家一样，因其生产手段的私有性与生产的社会性的矛盾，不可避免的每隔一个时期（约为十年）要发生经济危机，从一八七三年到现在，已经随着世界经济危机发生过七次危机了，第一次是一八七三——七四，第二次是一八八三——八五，第三次是一八九○——九二，第四次是一九○七——八，第五次是一九二○——二一，第六次是一九二九——三二，第七次是一九三七——三九。每一次危机的情况都是生产大量低落，失业到处发生，工资极度低减，物价惨跌，贸易停滞，股票市价剧烈降落。最严重而且最深刻的一次，是一九二九——三二年。瓦尔加和世界各国的经济学者，认为今明年要到来的美国经济危机的严重程度，将和这一次差不多，甚至超过。
    一九二九——三二年美国经济危机也是世界总危机中最大最剧烈的。在这时，美国的基本工业各部门的生产额，倒退到廿五年至四十年前的状况，一九三二年的工业生产甚至比危机刚开始的一九二九年还要降低百分之四十七．二，熔铸钢铁的设备，只应用了百分之十三，制造汽车的机器只应用了百分之十一。国民的财富在一九三一年仅为二千四百万万美金，较一九二九年的四千万万美金减低了十分之四。危机到达顶点时，一千七百万的美国工人失业，（等于全国工人总数的一半）。一九三二年，美国资本家付给工人的工资总额，只有危机前的百分之三十三。无论那条美国大路上，都可以遇到许多成群结队，扶老携幼，携带家具到各处寻找工作的人们。很多人在垃圾堆上找寻抛弃了的残余食物，自杀几乎每天都有。成千成万的农家也倾家荡产，小麦批发价格降低了百分之七十，棉花、白糖、咖啡、毛类的价格，降低了一半以上，农业资本家们，把囤积的粮食烧毁，任其腐烂，或抛入大海，牛奶也被大量倾到河中，以图使市场“景气”。进出口贸易方面，一九三二年的输入额比一九二九降低百分之七十，输出额也是一样。三一、八八二个企业完全破产，信用危机使得华尔街的银行纷纷倒闭，股票行市惨跌百分之七五……。
    第二个问题：预见美国经济危机的根据何在？
    第一、从危机的最主要标志——生产过剩与购买力大减来看，根据瓦尔加的统计，现在美国的生产力已超过战前的一倍多。战后军用物资的存货，价值一千万万美金，制造机器的车床，足够十年之用。目前批发和零售商品的存货，多逾三百四十万万美元，而且每月要增加十万万元，大批的洋芋也正在准备焚毁。战争时期扩充的军火军需工厂，占战前全部工厂的三分之一，它们进入和平时期以后的转业问题是非常困难的。至于美国财阀们在战争中所赚得的五百二十四万万战争利润，更是没有出路。另一方面根据最近真理报记者犹里·朱可夫的报导，广大的美国人民，已开始走入穷困之中，“过去五个月内物价上升的高度，已等于战争时期五十个月的上升高度”，而美国工人百分之八十都在衣食水平以下生活。加利福尼亚大学研究结果，一个美国人维持四口之家的最低生活，一年需要二九六四美元，但事实上美国人民百分之七十没有这种最低供应能力。杜鲁门宣布五百万美国人没有住所，即使组织给很大的地方，也有七十五万人找不着屋子而流浪街头。去年失业的人数已逾四百万万，罢工的人数也是如此，打破了美国历史上罢工的纪录。
    第二、从美国集中世界财富，而世界市场日益缩小的矛盾来说。美国集中了世界黄金总量的百分之八十，约三百万万美元左右，成为许多国家的债权人，然而由于这些财富，大部分集中在金融寡头的手中，因而这成了美国反动外交政策的基础。这样一来，美国的财富就难于在世界市场中消化，以获得更大的资本再积累。因为这次世界大战以后，欧洲已出现了许多的新民主国家，他们虽然也迫切希望获得外资，来加速国内的发展，但绝不愿意接受美国的金元侵略。苏联也并非不愿意在经济建设方面得到美国的帮助。可是美帝国主义的反苏死硬派，破坏了美苏贸易的互惠之路。中国这样大的一个市场，也被反动的援蒋内战政策所破坏了，现在的英国的某些保守分子，已都为了帝国市场的保有而开始表现了反美的倾向。这些矛盾，美帝国主义是无法克服的，这些矛盾的日益增长，也就日益缩小美元帝国的世界市场，而加速经济危机的到来。
    第三、从股票证券的跌价来看。工业高度发展的资本主义国家，股票证券的行情，是经济的寒暑表，它的升降表示着繁荣与不景气。下降到一定的低度，便是经济危机的信号。根据去年十一月瓦尔加所说：“美国工业股票证券的总值由五月半的八百四十万万美金，跌落到六百五十万万美金。行成这样的暴跌，从历史的经验证明，往往开始于经济恐慌到来之前约十二个月到十八个月的时候，因为金融寡头政治消息灵通的大亨们，已开始惧怕危机到来而抛出股票证券了。”
    第三个问题：美国垄断资本家有那些重要人物，势力如何？
    美国垄断资本家有那些重要的人物，势力如何？这个问题，如欲详细了解，可以参考张冀声翻译的《美国资本家》。在这里只能概略的讲一下：
    美国的垄断资本家，大大小小一齐计算，总数不过五百余家。他们垄断了美国财富百分之六十以上，而这些家族中最大的只有六十四家。其中洛克菲勃与摩根两大集团的财富，多达九三○万万美元以上，占美国全部公司财产的三分之一。其次如梅隆、杜邦、福特……等声势也很不小。（这还是战前的统计，战后没有确切的调查过），目前八大金融集团（梅隆、杜邦、洛克菲勒、摩根四家庭、库因银行、克里福兰、芝加哥、波茨顿）控制了全美二百家头号公司中的一百七十五家，控制了全美多数报纸、通讯社、广播公司、杂志社……等等。（各种进步报纸杂志例外）所有美国大财阀的人口，不到全美人数的百分之一、但却在经济上政治上统治着百分之九十九的美国人民。
    第四个问题：美国垄断资本家企图用什么方法逃出经济危机？
    美国独占资本家一方面造成行将到来的经济危机，另一方面也想摆脱危机的枷锁，在从前，他们借战争来逃出经济恐慌，现在却不可能了，因为二十世纪五十年代已经是人民革命的时代，苏联、新民主国家和世界各国的民主力量，日益强大，美国人民的觉悟与团结斗争的力量，也日益增长。虽然美国的金融财阀们仍在主观的幻想，把经济危机的枷锁，完全枷到美国人民颈顶上，甚至也认真的准备所谓“新战争”，可是斯大林早已给他们作了结论：“我不相信新战争的实际危险”。所以在全世界和平民主的进步力量日益增长壮大，美国人民的民主运动日益发展的场合之下，美国的金融寡头们是无法逃出行将到来的经济危机，而只有日趋没落走向坟墓。
