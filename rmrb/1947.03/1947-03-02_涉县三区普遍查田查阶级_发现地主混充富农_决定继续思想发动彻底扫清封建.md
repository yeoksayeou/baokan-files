　　【This Newspaper, Shexian News】After the Spring Festival, the Third District here universally launched a land investigation and class verification movement. In addition to in-depth investigations and interviews with the masses by district cadres, mass mutual inspections were also launched in various villages. In the past half month, three types of problems have been universally discovered in the district: (1) Serious feudal remnants exist. Liu Wenku, a landlord in Zhaoyu, infiltrated the rich peasant class; four operating landlords in Qiu Zi Yu hid among the rich or middle peasants to escape liquidation. In many villages where the elimination of feudal remnants was not thorough, landlords still launched counterattacks against the masses at any time. Zhang Youwang, a landlord in Hou Xiyu, kept a "record of the changing times" in his arms, telling his son to write down the opinions raised by the masses in preparation for retaliation. Li ××, a landlord in Nanguokou, deliberately pretended to be poor and begged for food at the cadres' homes, composing superstitious tunes to scold people. (2) Cadres and activists distributed too many fruits of labor and became divorced from the masses: The political director of Qianzhai was a lower-middle peasant, classified as extremely poor and distributed too many fruits of labor; the director of the armed committee divided the family in order to obtain more fruits, with one household receiving three shares, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The director of the armed committee in Shaqi had his own donkey, and also received a donkey and sold it, which made the general peasants very dissatisfied. Cadres in Yangjiazhai adopted reward methods to distribute more fruits of labor in disguised form. This affected the inability of deficit households to thoroughly turn over, and rifts occurred between cadres and the masses. (3) There are knots among the peasants, which affect the unease of some rich middle peasants, who eat and drink extravagantly. Kang Jin, a middle peasant in Mabu, was afraid of struggle and ate dumplings behind closed doors every night. Poor peasants in Dongshu ate whatever they were given, waiting to be given more fruits of labor and eat "struggle meals." Rich middle peasants in Luanshiyan had the idea of "cutting leeks," hindering the development of this year's production movement.

　　The district leadership has already divided villages into three types based on the development of the movement throughout the district, and will continue to carry out ideological mobilization to struggle against the landlords. After ideological education and mobilization, cadres will withdraw the extra fruits of labor and resolve the relationship between cadres and the masses. For villages focusing on organizing production, further mobilize the laggards, resolve the thoughts of the knot-ridden households, and clear away obstacles on the road to production.

　　涉县三区普遍查田查阶级
    发现地主混充富农
    决定继续思想发动彻底扫清封建
    【本报涉县讯】此间三区于春节后普遍进行查田查阶级运动，各村除由区干部深入群众调查访问外，并发动了群众性互相检查。半月来发现全区普遍存在三类问题：（一）封建尾巴严重存在，赵峪地主刘文库混入富农阶层，秋子峪四户经营地主隐蔽到富农或中农里逃避了清算，许多对封建残余扫除不彻底村，地主还随时向群众反攻。后西峪地主张有旺怀中记着变天账，叫他儿子把群众提的意见都记下，准备报复。南郭口地主李××故意装穷，到干部家中讨饭，编上迷信词调骂人。（二）干部积极分子多分果实脱离群众：前寨政治主任是个下中农，划为赤贫多分果实，武委主任因图多分果实而分家，一户得三股东西，引起群众不满，沙岐武委主任自家有驴、又分个驴卖了，一般农民很不满意，杨家寨干部采取奖励办法，变相多分果实，这影响窟窿户不能彻底翻身，干部与群众之间发生裂痕。（三）农民内部存在圪瘩、影响一部富中农情绪不安，大吃二喝。马布中农康金怕斗争，每天黑夜关门吃饺子，东戍贫农分啥吃啥，等着再分果实吃斗争饭。乱石岩富中农产生割韭菜思想，阻碍今年的生产运动开展。
    该区领导上已根据全区运动发展，划分三种类型村，继续进行思想发动向地主斗争，经过思想教育动员，干部退出多分果实，解决干部群众关系。对以组织生产为重点村，进一步发动落后，解决圪瘩户思想，扫除生产道路上的障碍。
