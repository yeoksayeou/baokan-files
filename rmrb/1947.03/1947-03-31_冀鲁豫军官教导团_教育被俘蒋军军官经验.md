    Jiluyu Military Officer Training Regiment
    Experience in Educating Captured Chiang Kai-shek Officers
    [Our newspaper's Jiluyu dispatch, 29th] The Jiluyu Military Officer Training Regiment has summarized its experience in educating Chiang Kai-shek officers who have laid down their arms: Since the Longhai Campaign, the training regiment has successively received more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek officers who have laid down their arms. After continuous releases and departures, there are still more than 600. Generally, when officers who have laid down their arms first arrive at the training regiment, they express skepticism due to long-term deception by the Kuomintang and do not believe in the Eighth Route Army's lenient policy of not killing. After the "American Troops Get Out of China Movement," they realized that the United States was an aggressor country and that Chiang Kai-shek had sold out China's sovereignty. At the same time, they also understood the Eighth Route Army's lenient policy, and a group of activists began to emerge, launching an accusation movement. In the first stage, the leadership made an enlightening report, systematically exposing the dark rule and crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families, and called on everyone to rise up and accuse. It pointed out why accuse? Accuse what? Accuse whom? ... The slogans were: "Move away the stone and return to the people's standpoint; boldly accuse, and you are serving the people. It is your own study achievement." After combined group deliberations, a heated debate unfolded. In the second stage, the focus was on talking about personal suffering. At the beginning, the phenomenon of talking and laughing indifferently and the idea of "it's just fate" were corrected. During the group deliberations, cadres went deep into the groups, discovered typical examples, and broke through the thinking of typical figures. Then, he immediately mobilized him to go to the general meeting to accuse. The atmosphere at the meeting was warm and somber. Among the 615 people, 488 accused of personal suffering. Among the first detachment, 200 confessed their personal crimes, and 274 cried. Some cried so much that the meeting could not be held, and many people could not eat. But it was only sadness, not resentment. The third stage shifted to accusing the darkness and crimes of the old society (Chiang-controlled areas). It was more extensive and more heated than the second stage, with content such as conscription, corruption, and the oppression and exploitation of the Baojia chiefs. The accusations lasted for three days, and among the 615 people, 138 accused of the crimes of the old society. The fourth stage was tracing the roots, finding that the source of the suffering was the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families. Tracing the roots was done in groups, with questions and answers. After tracing back and forth, it focused on one issue, and a heated debate unfolded. For example, Li Yuanchun's whole family was killed by the Kuomintang, and he asked: "Where is the root of my suffering?" Everyone also helped him trace the root, so that he realized that the suffering was caused by the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families. Unlimited hatred made him unable to eat for four days. All debates finally reached a truth: "Without ending the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families, the Chinese people will never have the hope of happiness." Then, confession was launched again. 315 people confessed their crimes in the old society. Finally, a summary of the accusation movement was made, as well as a report on the concept of "orthodoxy," which historically broke the erroneous "orthodox" and "legal" thinking, and put forward the slogans of defending the border areas and defending Chairman Mao. After the thinking of 400 officers was cleared, they automatically signed up to join the Eighth Route Army and fight to end the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and the Four Big Families.

    教育被俘蒋军军官经验
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】冀鲁豫军官教导团总结教育放下武器之蒋军军官的经验：教导团自陇海战役后，先后接收放下武器的蒋军军官达两千余人。经不断释放及送走，尚有六百余。一般放下武器的军官初到教导团时，由于长期受到国民党的欺骗蒙蔽表示出怀疑的情绪，不相信八路军的宽大不杀政策。在“美军退出中国运动”后，他们才认识到美国是侵略国，蒋介石出卖了中国主权。同时也就了解了八路军的宽大政策，开始出现一批积极分子，展开了控诉运动。第一阶段，领导上作了一个启发性的报告，有系统的暴露了蒋介石及四大家族的黑暗统治和罪恶后，号召大家起来控诉。指出为什么控诉？控诉什么？向谁控诉？……口号是：“搬开石头，回到人民立场；大胆控诉，就是为人民服务。就是自己的学习成绩。”结合小组酝酿后，展开了热烈的争论。第二阶段，就讲个人痛苦。开始时纠正谈笑不在乎现象及“命该如此”的思想。在小组酝酿中，干部深入到小组里去，发现典型，打通典型分子的思想。然后，马上动员他到大会上去控诉。会上空气热烈而沉痛。六百一十五人中有四百八十八人控诉了个人痛苦。一大队坦白个人罪恶的就有二百名，哭的有二百七十四名。有的哭得会都无法开了，很多人吃不下饭去。但只是悲伤没有引起愤恨。第三阶段转到控诉旧社会（蒋管区）的黑暗和罪恶。比第二阶段更广泛更热烈，内容为抓壮丁、贪污、保甲长的压迫剥削等，直控诉了三天，在六百一十五人中，有一百三十八人控诉了旧社会的罪恶。第四阶段是追根，找出了痛苦的来源是蒋介石及四大家族的血腥统治。追根是以组为单位，一问一答。追来追去，集中到一个问题，展开热烈的争论。如李元春的全家被国民党杀了，他问：“我的苦根在什么地方？”大家也帮他追根，使他认识了苦是蒋介石四大家族的统治造成的。无限的仇恨使他四天没吃下饭去。一切争论最后都得到了一个真理：“不结束蒋介石四大家族的黑暗统治，中国人民永远没有幸福的希望。”接着又发动坦白。有三百一十五人坦白了自己在旧社会的罪恶。最后作了控诉运动的总结，和关于“正统”观念的报告，从历史上打破了错误的“正统”“合法”思想，提出了保卫边区、保卫毛主席的口号。四百名军官思想打通后，即自动报名参加八路军，为结束蒋介石及四大家族的黑暗统治而战斗。
