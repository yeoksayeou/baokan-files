Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 11th: Guerrilla warfare in the Taihang border areas saw new developments in February. According to incomplete statistics, there were 171 major battles throughout the month, 24 important strongholds were recovered, and 3,046 Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops were annihilated. On the southern front in northern Henan, the Taihang Eighth Route Army, in coordination with the Lunan self-defense war, captured Fenzhangchi in Xinxiang on the 3rd (Xinxiang is one of Chiang Kai-shek's important strategic bases for the civil war in North China). From the 7th to the 13th, in a week, it recovered 13 strongholds including Dengjia Village on the outskirts of Tangyin and Hebi, annihilating 1,600 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and more than 30,000 local people regained their freedom. The vast area west of Dasima and Tianhong Bridge (Wen Sidong, north bank of the Yellow River) on the Daqing Road, and east of Chongyizhen (between Qinyang and Meng County), is now entirely under the control of the people. At present, the mass guerrilla warfare on the west side of the Pinghan Road and south of the Daqing Road, combined with land redistribution, has developed from points to areas, and has changed from a secret form to an open struggle. On the northern front in the Jinzhong area, eight strongholds including Baiyan in Taigu were recovered on the 16th, controlling an area of more than 30 li in the plains. On the 27th, it directly approached the suburbs of Qixian County, and there are no enemy traces in the area more than ten li outside the city. Now, the no-man's land on the border of the Tongpu, Zhengtai, and northern sections of the Pinghan railways is gradually shrinking. Landlords and conscripted laborers who fled are carrying "Certificates of Honorable Return" distributed by the armed work teams and returning to the liberated areas. In villages such as Lutai in Yuci alone, 53 landlord households and more than 90 conscripted laborers have returned home.

This newspaper, Taihang, 12th: The situation of the all-out struggle against the enemy in northern Henan has developed considerably. Since January, the four border counties on the west side of Pinghan, Anyang, Tangyin, Jiqi, and Huixian, have combined armed struggle, political offensives, and land redistribution, and actively carried out activities to threaten Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets. In Anyang, under the development of the meritorious service campaign, the landmine warfare in the border area and the enemy's rear flying explosions cooperated with each other, so that the enemy in Shuiye and Guantai dared not act rashly. In Jiqi County, more than 40 villages have been firmly controlled by us. Small guerrilla base areas in the depth of the area at the junction of Anyang and Tangyin have also gradually become consolidated and expanded. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops stationed in the city of Huixian are being beaten by our armed work teams day and night. The local armed forces of the masses in this area often harassed the outskirts of Xinxiang, and the armed forces of the masses in the plains developed dramatically. On the 250-li struggle line west of Pinghan, from Anyang in the north to Xinxiang in the south, we have completely taken the initiative.

This newspaper reports: Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets gathered the 32nd Division of the Third Army stationed in Shimen and parts of Wei Yonghe from Yuanshi, a total of more than 3,000 people, and launched a so-called destructive "mopping up" operation in three routes to the triangular area of Huo (Lu) Jing (Xing) Yuan (Shi) from February 28th to March 3rd. They once advanced to Songgou, Tongye, Jianshan and Xianwengzhai and Nanzuo in Yuanshi, with two planes assisting in the battle. After our Taihang Eighth Route Army blocked them in separate routes for several days, they retreated in panic on the 3rd. Wherever the enemy went, they looted and killed wantonly, and all the furniture that had not been moved was destroyed. The Taihang District Democratic Government sent special personnel to Nanzuo and Xianwengzhai to carry out relief work on the 5th.

　　游击战与政攻反倒算结合
    太行二月份歼敌三千
    豫北路西游击根据地由小变大
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十一日电】二月份太行边沿区游击战争有新的发展，据不完全统计，全月较大战斗一七一次，收复重要据点二十四处，歼蒋阎伪军三○四六名。南线豫北方面，太行八路军为配合鲁南自卫战，于三日攻克新乡之分浆池（新乡为蒋介石华北内战之重要战略基地之一），七日至十三日一周中，收复汤阴鹤壁外围之邓家村等十三个据点，歼蒋伪军一千六百名，当地群众三万余人已重获自由。道清路侧沁河南岸大司马、天虹桥（温丝东，黄河北岸）以西、崇义镇（沁阳孟县间）以东广大地区，已全为人民掌握。现平汉路西侧、道清路以南群众游击战争结合反倒算，已由点发展到面，由过去秘密形态转为公开的斗争。北线晋中地区，十六日收复太谷之白燕等八个据点，控制平川方圆三十余里地区，二十七日并直逼祁县城郊，现该城十余里外地区已无敌踪。现同蒲、正太、平汉北段边地无人区已日渐缩小，逃亡地主与被抓壮丁纷纷携带武工队散发之“荣归证”重返解放区，仅榆次麓台等村返家者已有地主五十三户，壮丁九十余人。
    【本报太行十二日电】豫北全面对敌斗争形势，已有相当开展。平汉西侧之安阳、汤阴、汲淇、辉县等四个边沿县，元月以来，均将武装、政攻、反倒算三者相结合，积极活动，予蒋伪以威胁。安阳在立功运动开展下，边地之地雷战与敌后飞行爆炸相互配合，使水冶、观台敌不敢轻举妄动。汲淇县已有四十余村为我确掌，安、汤交界处，纵深地区之小型游击根据地，亦已渐趋巩固扩大。辉县驻城之蒋伪军，日夜在我武工队敲打中。该地区之群众地方武装，且经常出扰新乡外围，平原群众武装力量激剧发展。北起安阳，南迄新乡二百五十华里之平汉西侧斗争线上，我已完全操取主动。
    【本报讯】蒋伪纠集驻石门之第三军三十二师及元氏魏永和等各一部，共三千余人，于二月二十八日至三月三日，分三路向我获（鹿）井（陉）元（氏）三角地带举行所谓毁灭性“扫荡”。曾一度进至松沟、铜冶、尖山及元氏仙翁寨、南佐等地，井以飞机两架助战。经我太行八路军连日分路阻击，于三日仓惶撤退。此次敌人所到之处，大肆劫杀，全部未及搬走家具，均被毁坏。太行区民主政府已于五日派专人赴南佐、仙翁寨一带进行善后。
