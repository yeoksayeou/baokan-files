Border Region Government Launches Production Campaign: Spinning Textiles and Accumulating Manure Reaches Climax
Chairman Yang Personally Delivers Manure to the Fields

[Our Newspaper] The Border Region Government's spinning textiles and manure accumulation campaign has reached a climax. Since the mobilization by Chairman Yang Rong, Vice-Chairmen, and Secretary-General Sun last week, each group immediately took wooden signs, paper strips, paste, and hoes to find small plots of land behind the mountains or on the river滩 that same afternoon. That night, each group specifically discussed the leaders' reports and, based on the personal task standards set by the Central Bureau Administrative Office, democratically assessed the public tasks that each individual should complete; and formulated annual production and savings plans. The next day, they went to the masses to borrow spinning wheels. Seeing that the comrades of the government departments were all spinning, the masses also perked up. Since it was not easy for everyone to borrow spinning wheels, they hurried to Yetao to attend the fair and carried back forty-five or six spinning wheels at the February 2nd assembly, and the spinning movement quickly entered a heatwave. Before the public loans of cotton were delivered, they bought it themselves or borrowed from landlords. As of March 2nd, thirty-seven spinning wheels had started spinning, forty-one people had learned the technique, and fourteen pounds of yarn had been spun. After dinner every evening, comrades from all departments entered into tense labor. After Hao Liaofu, the secretary, spun for three days, he wrote on the red bulletin board: "Some people say that it's too late to learn a skill at thirty, but I'm in my fifties. After three and a half days of learning, I've already learned it. This dogma has been shattered by the facts." Section Chief Zhao Wangnian, although old, still spins two ounces at night; Doctor Ren Xiuying did not rest on Sunday and spun half a catty of yarn. Her husband, Liu Xinghan, was envious and determined to compete with her. Comrade Wang Jianhua of the guard formally challenged instructor Yang Kai to a competition to see who spun more and more evenly.

In addition to spinning, the manure accumulation movement is also quite enthusiastic. In the past, everyone went to the parade ground for morning exercises every day. In recent days, they have all gone to collect manure or clean up furniture. The guard collected the most manure, and they sometimes collected it along the way, all the way to the edge of ×× village. In addition to accumulating three or four loads of manure, the Education Department also repaired collapsed toilets one afternoon. Manure delivery to small plots has also begun, and Chairman Yang personally delivered manure and found three excellent varieties. The young lads of the guard were moved by the leader's personal efforts. After Chairman Yang delivered the manure, everyone unanimously decided to cultivate the land on behalf of Chairmen Yang Rong and Sun, writing in a letter: "We were very moved to see the leaders personally deliver manure. The leaders are busy with work, not very strong, and older. If they work too hard, it will affect the overall work. We will complete the task on behalf of the leaders so that the leaders don't have to worry." After receiving the letter, Secretary-General Sun immediately replied to thank them and declined their offer to cultivate on their behalf, saying in the letter: "Chairman Yang Rong is busy with work and can help with some cultivation, but not necessarily all cultivation. I have no problem completing my personal tasks and do not need everyone to cultivate on my behalf. Thank you for your great concern."

After the start of the government's production movement, the club changed the past "Border Region Government Life" bulletin board into two types of bulletin boards: production savings red and black lists, to timely commend model figures and criticize those who are not active in production; now the red list is full of manuscripts, and there is not a single word on the black list. The most popular thing on the red list is the biography of production heroes. The first episode writes "Liu Xinghan and his wife compete, Zhang Guangju and his son make contributions"; the second episode writes "Old man Hao Liaofu learns to spin, Zhang Shangzhong holds a child and sprouts bean sprouts"; the third episode is "Chairman Yang delivers manure, Secretary-General spins."

　　边府开展生产运动纺织积肥走上高潮
    杨主席亲自上地送粪
    【本报讯】边府机关纺织积肥运动走上高潮。自上周杨戎正副主席孙秘书长动员后，当日下午各小组就带着木牌、纸条、浆糊、镐头，到山后或河滩寻找小块地。当天黑夜，各小组即专门讨论了首长报告，并根据中央局行政处所订个人任务标准，民主评定个人应缴公任务；订定全年生产节约计划。第二天就分头向群众借纺车，群众见机关同志都要纺花，也提起劲来。大家不容易借到纺车，就赶快跑到冶陶赶会，在二月二大会上就背回四十五六架纺车，纺织运动很快就进入热潮。公家贷花还未运到，即自己购买，或向房东借。截至三月二日，已有卅七辆纺车动工纺花，四十一人学会技术，已纺线十四斤。每日晚饭后，各厅处同志均进入紧张的劳动。郝寥夫秘书纺了三天花以后，在红榜上写道：“有人说三十不学艺，我五十来岁的人了，经过三天半的学习，已经学会，这种教条被我以事实粉碎。”赵望年科长年虽老，但在夜间还要纺二两；任秀英医生礼拜日一天未休息，纺线半斤。她的丈夫刘兴汉看的眼红，定要和她竞赛。警卫队王建华同志正式向指导员杨凯同志提出挑战，比赛纺的多纺的匀。
    除纺织外，积肥运动也相当热烈。过去每天早晨，大家都上操场出操。近数日来，都去拾粪或收拾家俱了。警卫队拾粪最多，他们有时顺路拾，一直走到××村边。教育厅除积肥三四驮外，还在一个下午修整坍毁厕所。小块地送粪也已经开始，杨主席亲自送粪，并找到优良品种三种。由于首长亲自动手，警卫队的青年小伙子被感动了。在杨主席送粪以后，全体一致决议替杨戎孙首长代耕，写信说：“我们看到首长亲自送粪很受感动，首长工作繁忙，身体不十分强壮，年纪较大，如果劳动过度对整个工作有影响，我们代首长完成任务，不用首长挂心。”孙秘书长接信后立即复信致谢，并谢绝为其个人代耕任务，信里说：“杨戎主席工作忙，可以帮忙代耕一些，但不一定全部代耕。我个人完成任务不成问题，不需大家代耕，敬谢关怀之盛意。”
    机关生产运动开始后，俱乐部即将过去“边府生活”墙报改为生产节约红黑榜两种，及时表扬模范人物，批评生产不积极的人；现红榜稿件满篇，黑榜上尚无一字。红榜上最受人欢迎的是生产英雄传，第一回写“刘兴汉夫妇竞赛，张广居父子立功”；第二回写“郝寥夫老汉学纺花，张尚忠抱孩生豆芽”；第三回是“杨主席送粪，秘书长纺花”。
