　　National Anti-Japanese League Preparatory Committee Issues Declaration
    Calling on Students Nationwide to Participate in Patriotic Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] According to a Shanghai report by TASS on the 27th, citing Shanghai newspapers: The Preparatory Committee of the National Students' Federation Against American Atrocities issued a declaration, calling on student representatives nationwide to join the organization and take action against the stationing of American troops in China, the continued supply of military materials to the Chiang government by the United States, and the erroneous American policy toward China. The declaration firmly believes that students nationwide will participate in the struggle and lead a new patriotic movement to achieve China's independence. The declaration also points out that the Chiang government must immediately cease conscription and abolish conscription.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] Chongqing News: The Chongqing Students' Federation Against American Atrocities held a reception for people from all walks of life on the 27th of last month, with over a hundred people attending. The chairman of the Anti-Japanese League reported that the anti-atrocity work had not slackened after the parade and was being actively carried out even during school exams. He said: We demand that American troops withdraw from China and that the unequal Sino-American commercial treaty be abolished. This is the demand of the people of the whole country, and we must achieve this goal before we can stop. He sadly pointed out: Their work has been subjected to heavy blows, oppression, and division by the Kuomintang reactionaries. For example, Nanshan Middle School silently expelled students who participated in this movement. He said: "What is wrong with our patriotism? Isn't the country supposed to be loved?" At this point, tears streamed down his face, and he sobbed uncontrollably. People from all walks of life attending the meeting, including Xu Baolin and Shen Qiyu, unanimously expressed their determination to fully support the students' patriotic anti-atrocity movement, and donated money on the spot, amounting to 5.9 million yuan.

　　全国抗联筹备会发表宣言
    号召全国学生参加爱国运动
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据塔斯社上海二十七日电引沪报消息称：全国学生抗议美军暴行联合会筹备会发表宣言，号召全国学生元首参加这一组织，以行动反对美军驻华、美国继续以军火供给蒋政府及错误的美国对华政策。宣言坚信全国学生将参加斗争，并领导新的爱国运动，以获得中国的独立。宣言又指出，蒋政府必须立即停止征兵，废除征兵。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】渝讯：重庆学生抗议美军暴行联合会，上月二十七日招待各界人士，到百余人。抗联主席报告抗暴工作在游行后并未松懈，虽在学校考试中亦在积极进行。他说：我们要求美军退出中国，也要求取消不平等的中美商约，这是全国人民的要求，我们必须达到目的才能停止。他沉痛指出：他们的工作曾受到国民党反动派的重重打击、压迫、分化，如南山中学竟默退该校参加此一运动之同学。他说：“我们爱国有什么罪？难道国是不应爱的吗？”说至此，泪流满面，泣不成声。与会各界人士徐宝林、沈起予等一致表示，决以全力支援学生爱国抗暴运动；并当场捐款，款达五十九万元。
