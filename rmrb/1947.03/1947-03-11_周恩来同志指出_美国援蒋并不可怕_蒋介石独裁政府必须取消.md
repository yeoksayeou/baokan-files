Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Comrade Zhou Enlai delivered a full speech at the mobilization meeting of all circles in Yan'an to defend the border region, Yan'an, and Chairman Mao on the 8th.

Comrades: Today we are holding a mobilization meeting to mobilize everyone to defend the border region, defend Yan'an, and defend Chairman Mao.

Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are coming to attack our border region for the third time. Many people think that since they didn't come the last two times, maybe they won't come this time either.

Comrades, don't think like that. He is determined to come. Why is he coming? Because he is now suffering defeats in many places throughout the country, and the People's Liberation Army in many liberated areas has annihilated a large number of his troops. In the past eight months, we have annihilated 65 of his brigades and captured more than 100 of his generals, lieutenant generals, and major generals. Because he cannot win battles elsewhere, he wants to vent his anger on our border region. Can we in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region let him vent his anger? (The crowd shouted: No!) That's right; other liberated areas are winning battles, the Northeast, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi liberated areas are all winning battles, and they have captured his generals. Can we in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region lag behind? (The crowd shouted: No!) That's right, we should annihilate more of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's attacking troops. (The crowd shouted: Good!) Chiang Kai-shek is also bankrupt financially, issuing banknotes indiscriminately, making the banknotes worthless, causing financial turmoil, things are sold expensively, and the people can no longer survive, so they are rising up to make trouble with him; even if he has the support of US imperialism, he cannot be propped up. Because of this, he cannot think of any other way, so he only has one last resort, using the attack on Yan'an to save the lost popular support. Isn't this a dream! He no longer wants peace talks now, he has driven our representatives back from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, closed down our Xinhua Daily, arrested our people outside, and arrested democratic progressive people, professors, students, workers, and staff members in large numbers. Many people have been injured or killed. He does not want peace. Therefore, if we do not eliminate his strength and defeat his offensive, there will be no real peace.

Chiang Kai-shek is now relying on the help of his foreign father—US imperialism—to carry out the civil war. This kind of help is nothing great, nothing terrible. In the year and a half since Japan surrendered, the United States has helped Chiang Kai-shek equip more than 40 divisions, sent 271 warships, helped with loans and materials worth more than 2 billion US dollars, and sent nearly 1,000 advisors to help him fight. As a result, in the most recent eight months alone, we have annihilated 65 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and taken the American guns and cannons for our own use (loud applause). Now Chiang Kai-shek wants to borrow money from the United States by capturing Yan'an. Probably the United States will at most lend him another 500 or 700 million US dollars. The United States lent him more than 2 billion US dollars in the past year and a half and could not prop him up. Even if it lends him another 500 or 700 million this year, it will still not be able to prop him up. We have seen through that Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor. Unless his dictatorial and traitorous rule is abolished, there can be no true independence. Therefore, our demand for national independence is to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and oppose US aid to Chiang in the civil war! (The crowd shouted: Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and oppose US imperialism!)

Chiang Kai-shek also wants to deceive people by replacing a few people in his government and calling it a "reorganized government." This is also useless. It's all just changing the soup but not the medicine. It's still a dictatorial rule. Can removing He Yingqin, Kong Xiangxi, and Song Ziwen and replacing them with Chen Cheng, Zhang Qun, and Zhang Jiaao solve the problem? Isn't it still the same dictatorial, traitorous, and civil war! Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government must be abolished before China can achieve true democracy. Therefore, our demand for democracy and freedom is to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Comrades, compatriots, we are determined not to let other liberated areas compete to be the first, while our border region lags behind. We are China's premier liberated area, but we have not yet won a victory. Now that we want to be the elder brother of all the liberated areas, we must win a victory. We have the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu here, and we will definitely win a victory. Everyone is of one mind, and yellow earth will turn into gold! (The crowd shouted: Unite and win victory!) Everyone, mobilize, defend our border region, defend our land, defend Yan'an, and defend Chairman Mao. We will definitely win!

### 周恩来同志指出  美国援蒋并不可怕  蒋介石独裁政府必须取消

　　周恩来同志指出
    美国援蒋并不可怕
    蒋介石独裁政府必须取消
    【新华社延安九日电】周恩来将军八日在延安各界保卫边区、保卫延安的动员大会上讲演全文：
    同志们：今天我们开动员大会，动员大家起来保卫边区，保卫延安，保卫毛主席。
    蒋介石、胡宗南要来进攻我们的边区，这已经是第三次了。许多人以为上两次既没有来，也许这次也不会来了。
    同志们，不要这样想，他是决定要来的。为什么要来？因为他现在在全国许多地方都打了败仗，许多解放区的人民解放军消灭了它的大量部队。过去八个月，我们消灭了他六十五个旅，捉了他一百多上将、中将、少将。他因为在别的地方不能打胜仗，所以要向我们边区出气，我们陕甘宁边区能让他出气么？（群众高呼：不让！）对的；我们别的解放区打胜仗，东北、山东、河南、河北、山西各个解放区都打胜仗，捉了他的将官，我们陕甘宁边区能落伍么？（群众高呼：不能！）对的，我们应该多多消灭蒋介石、胡宗南进攻的部队。（群众高呼：好！）蒋介石在财政上也破产了，滥出票子，使票子不值钱，金融闹风潮，东西卖的贵，人民已活不下去了，所以起来和他闹；纵使有美帝国主义撑腰，也是扶不起来了。因为这样，他想不到别的办法，就只有最后一个手段，拿进攻延安来挽救已失的人心，这岂非梦想！他现在已经不要和平谈判了，把我们的代表从南京、上海、重庆都赶回来了，把我们的新华日报封闭了，把我们在外边的人捉起来，并且大事逮捕民主进步的人士、教授、学生、工人、职员，有许多人被打伤打死，他是不要和平了。因此，如果不消灭他的力量，不打垮他的进攻，就决没有真正和平。
    蒋介石今天是靠他的洋爸爸——美国帝国主义的帮助来进行内战的，这种帮助也没有什么了不起，没有什么可怕。日本投降一年半，美国帮助蒋介石装备了四十多个师，送了二百七十一只军舰，帮助了借款物资二十多万万美元，派了近一千名顾问帮助他打仗。结果只最近八个月，我们便消灭蒋介石的部队六十五个旅，把美国的枪炮拿来我们用（大鼓掌）。现在蒋介石想以打下延安来向美国借款，大概美国顶多再借给他五万万或七万万美元。美国过去一年半，借给他二十多万万美元扶不起他来，今年就是再借五万万或七万万也是扶不起来的。我们已看透了蒋介石是一个卖国贼，不把它的独裁卖国的统治取消，就不能有真正的独立。因此，我们要求民族独立，就是打垮蒋介石的进攻，反对美国援蒋内战！（群众高呼：打垮蒋介石的进攻，反对美国帝国主义！）
    蒋介石还想骗人，把他的政府换上几个人就叫做“改组政府”，这也是毫无用处的，都是换汤不换药，还是独裁统治；把何应钦、孔祥熙、宋子文去掉，换上陈诚、张群、张嘉＠就能解决问题么？还不是一样的独裁卖国打内战！所以，蒋介石的独裁政府一定要取消，中国才能实现真正的民主。因此，我们要求民主自由，就要打垮蒋介石的进攻。同志们，同胞们，我们下定决心不要让别的解放区个个争先，而我们边区倒落后起来。我们是中国的首席解放区，但我们还没有打胜仗，现在我们要当各个解放区的老大哥，就要打胜仗。我们这里有毛主席、朱总司令的直接领导，一定能打胜仗。大家一条心，黄土变成金！（群众高呼：团结起来打胜仗！）大家动员起来，保卫我们的边区，保卫我们的土地，保卫延安，保卫毛主席，我们一定能胜利！
