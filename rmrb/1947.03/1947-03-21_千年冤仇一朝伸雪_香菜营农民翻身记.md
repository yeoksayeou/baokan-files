    A Thousand Years of Grievances Avenged in a Day
    —The Story of the Liberation of the Xiangcaiying Farmers
    Song Zhuqin
    Xiangcaiying is a border village in the south of the Third District of Linzhang, only ten or so li from the enemy. It has 296 households and 1,607 people. Before the land reform, the village had 6,797 mu of land, of which almost 40 percent (2,690 mu) had been seized by landlords. There were 111 poor peasant households, with 568 people, each possessing only 1.6 mu of land. Forty-five households, with 135 people, were destitute, owning not a single inch. They farmed the landlords' land, paying two-thirds of their harvest as rent and having to pay "door money" (apportioned based on the household). Outsiders had to pay double. Guo Xiang, a destitute man, could not afford the door money, so his bellows and pot were taken away, and he was driven out of the village. Hou Ji's child, Xiaobao, was also seized for the same reason. The people gnashed their teeth in hatred at the mention of door money. Hou Ji wanted to file a complaint, but the village head threatened, "I'll have you beaten to death on the road!" She had no choice but to swallow her tears and endure it.

    The landlord gang, led by Zhang Tongsheng and others, possessed two machine guns, 170 rifles, and 19 Mauser pistols. It was not a crime to kill the common people. Zhang Hesheng was executed along with two acquaintances from out of town, all because he let them stay overnight. Their house was also burned. Sun Lu and Chen Rong bought a few ears of sorghum from a thief, and the village head had eight mu of their sorghum cut down and even chased them to kill them. Sun Lu fled to Anyang, and his two children at home starved to death. Yang Taiyou had all his teeth knocked out, and Zhang Tongzhi was beaten deaf. There was hardly a farmer who hadn't been beaten or cursed by them. They controlled the village administration and embezzled as much as 10 million yuan in allocated goods (cloth, salt, matches, etc.). In famine years and every year during the lean season, they loaned grain at exorbitant interest rates, as high as "repaying five for every one borrowed." Grain prices were high when they loaned it, so they converted the grain into money; when grain prices were low in the autumn, they forced the peasants to repay the loan at the original grain price. When they loaned money, they charged 90, 80, or even 70 yuan as 100 yuan. In 1941, the interest rate reached one percent per day. Ma Qin's aunt and uncle were both forced to death because they "ate a hole" (ate the landlord's grain in a famine year). Ma Ruming and Shi Wenyi were forced into bankruptcy and became beggars. Many families were forced to abandon their homes and flee. They imposed a serf-like rule on their tenants: in addition to paying rent, tenants had to perform official duties for them, repair houses, grind grain, carry water, mix coal, sweep floors, visit relatives, carry chamber pots, and women had to sew and wash clothes, even make the bed warm; each person had to spend at least two months a year doing this.

    As early as 1941, the farmers of the village had spontaneously fought against the landlords. When the enemy requisitioned cotton, the landlords assigned it all to the peasants, requiring 12 jin per mu. The tenants of this village secretly joined forces with 130 tenant households from the neighboring Xiangcai Village and swore an oath to sue the landlords. But the landlords threatened to "terminate all tenancies," and no one dared to act. Instead, the landlords not only assigned the cotton as before but also raised the rent rate to 70 percent. Moreover, they changed the date for terminating tenancies from August 15th to October 15th (after the tenancy agreements in other villages had already been made), intending to drive the tenants to their deaths so they would accept even harsher conditions. The landlords were victorious and imitated the peasants' oath of struggle ("Whoever doesn't revolt is born of a daughter"), proposing "Whoever doesn't renew the tenancy is born of a daughter." The peasants swallowed their tears and renewed their tenancies.

    The year before last, in July, our army briefly liberated the area, and the hired worker Zhou Jinming and others rose up to demand wage increases. Soon after, the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded, and Zhang Quansheng drove Zhou out of the village. While Zhang and his ilk were in the village, they relied on Chiang's power to plunder at will. After the Pinghan Campaign, when our army arrived again, the peasant Wu Yitang reported to our army a platoon of Chiang's troops and their weapons that were hidden in the village, and they were captured. Zhang Tongwen frightened Wu, saying, "When the Central Army comes, they'll skin you alive!" Wu Yitang was so scared that he slept on the river滩 every night, and he eventually died of fright. When the hired tenant movement began last February, Zhang Quansheng and others forbade their own hired workers from attending meetings, threatening, "Whoever sticks their head out will be beaten to death!" Although the peasants did not stop the movement because of this, they were often timid in their hearts.

    Last year, after the work team directly under the military arrived in the village, they fully guided the masses to speak out about their grievances and find the root of their poverty. Within five days, they organized a farmers' association. The peasants' first demand was to seize the guns. The work team thoroughly supported the revolutionary demands of the masses and led them to confiscate all the landlords' guns. Then, they launched a general liquidation struggle to avenge thousands of years of grievances in a single day. At one struggle meeting alone, 183 people accused the landlords of their crimes, presenting two or three hundred cases of injustice. Murder, torture, fines, forced debt collection, moving pots and bellows... everything was poured out. According to the unanimous opinion of the masses, the government executed Zhang, and the masses cheered and celebrated.

    Property worth about 10 million yuan was moved from the homes of six tyrannical landlords to the farmers' association. The peasants elected representatives to distribute the property according to the needs of each household, such as the destitute and poor peasants, for their liberation. The masses said, "This is just enough to cover one item of the allocated goods they embezzled, it's not enough to repay our debts anyway!" Some said, "This is eating what you吐吐 out!" Guo Xiang said, "This is my door money!" Sun Lu said, "This is my sorghum!"... As a result of the distribution, each household received as little as 30,000 yuan or as much as over 100,000 yuan.

    A total of 19 qing of land was recovered. Tenant farmers who previously could not eat grain even when they farmed were each allocated 4.5 mu to make up for the shortfall, the destitute were allocated 4 mu, the poor peasants were allocated 3.5 mu, and middle peasants who had a large population but little land and not enough to cultivate were also allocated a portion.

    Through the land reform movement, the farmers' association grew to 1,212 members (71 percent of the population), and the militia had [number censored] members. They carry the landlords' guns, preparing to fight the traitor Guo Qing. They said, "The guns are still the same, but the hands have changed, and the mouths are aimed in a different direction!"

    千年冤仇一朝伸雪
    —香菜营农民翻身记
    宋祝勤
    香菜营是临漳三区南部距敌仅十来里的一个边沿村，二九六户，一六○七口人。土地改革以前，全村六七九七亩地，几乎百分之四十（二六九○亩）被地主掠为己有，贫农一一一户，五六八人，每人只有一·六亩。赤贫四五户，一三五人，则寸土没有。他们耕种地主土地，要交三分之二的租，要出“门头钱”（按门头派款），外来户要出双份。赤贫郭相出不起门头钱，被搬走风箱搬了锅，驱逐出村。侯冀氏也因此被扣走孩子小宝。老百姓一提起门头钱就恨得咬牙切齿。侯冀氏想告状，社首威吓说：“半路上打死你！”她只好含泪忍下去。
    以张同声等为首的恶霸地主集团，拥有机枪二挺、步枪一百七十支、盒子十九架，打死老百姓是不犯法的。张和生因为留两个外乡熟人住了一夜，三个人都被枪决，房子也烧了。孙禄和陈荣买了小偷几穗高粱，被社首将八亩高粱割去，还追着要杀。孙禄逃到安阳，家里两个孩子饿死了。杨太有被打落全部牙齿，张同知被打成聋耳朵，农民没挨过他们打骂的，几乎找不出来。他们把持村政，光贪污配给品（布、盐、火柴………等）即达一千万元。灾荒年与每年青黄不接时期，大放粮食账，利息有高到“吃一还五”的。放粮时期粮价高，将粮折价；秋后粮价低，又强迫农民照价还粮。放钱时，以九十、八十甚至七十顶一百。民国三十年，利率达到日利一分。马秦氏的婶婶和伯伯，都因为“吃窟窿”（灾荒年吃地主粮）被逼死。马如明、石文义，被逼得倾家荡产沿门讨饭。有许多人家，则被逼得弃家逃走。他们对佃农实行农奴式的统治：佃农除交租外，还得给他们支官差，修房盖屋、推磨、挑水、和煤、扫地、走亲戚、提尿壶，妇女给人家缝、洗衣服，甚至折被温床，每年每人至少得消耗两个月。
    民国三十年，该村农民即自发对地主起过斗争。敌人征棉花，地主一齐派到农民头上，每亩要十二斤。本村佃农与邻村香菜村佃农一百三十户秘密联合，宣了誓要与地主打官司。但地主以“一律解佃”威胁，就没人敢动了。回头地主不仅照数派花，更把租率提到百分之七十。而且把辞佃日期从八月十五改至十月十五（即各村租约都早已订好之后），要致佃农们死命，使之接受更苛条件。地主胜利了，即仿照农民的斗争誓词（谁不闹是闺女生的），提出“谁不复佃是闺女生的”。农民饮泪吞声，都复了佃。
    前年七月我军一度解放该地，雇工周金明等曾起而要求增资。不久蒋军侵入，张泉声即将周赶出村去。张等在村，更依仗蒋势，任意搜刮。平汉战役后，我军又到，农民吴义堂将藏匿本村的蒋军一班人枪报告我军，将其俘获。张同文吓吴说：“中央军来了剥你的皮！”吓得吴义堂夜夜躲到河滩睡觉，终于吓死了。去年二月雇佃运动开始时，张泉声等一面禁止自己雇工去开会，一面威胁说：“谁出头打死谁！”农民虽未因此停止运动，但心里时常是畏畏缩缩的。
    去年军直翻身工作队到达该村后，全力引导群众诉苦找穷根，五天内组织了农会，农民的第一个要求是夺枪。翻身队彻底支持群众的革命要求，领导群众把地主的枪全部搜出。接着就展开千年冤仇一日报的总清算斗争。一次斗争会上控诉地主罪恶的即达一百八十三人，提出二、三百件冤事。人命案、吊打罚、逼款逼债、搬锅搬风箱………，统统倾倒出来。政府依照群众一致的意见，将张枪决，群众欢呼震天。
    约值一千万元的财物从六家恶霸地主家里被搬到农会里，农民选举代表，按照赤贫、贫农等各户翻身的需要来分配。群众说：“这些东西刚够他们贪污的配给品一宗，反正不够还咱的账！”有的说：“这是吃啥吐啥！”郭相说：“这是我的门头钱！”孙禄说：“这是我的高粱！”…………分配结果，少的一户三万元，多的分到十万元以上。
    土地共收回十九顷。以前种地不能吃粮的佃农每人按四亩半填平，赤贫按四亩填平，贫农按三亩半填平，中农人多地少、不够耕种的，也分一部。
    经过土地改革运动，农会发展到一二一二人（占人口百分之七一），民兵××人，他们背着地主的枪，准备和大汉奸郭清打仗。他们说：“枪还是原来的，就是换了手，调了口！”
