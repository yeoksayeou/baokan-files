Cooperative Hero Li Jiakui Enthusiastically Organizes Production; Beiliu Cooperative Establishes Credit Department
[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] Under the leadership of Cooperative Hero Comrade Li Jiakui, the Beiliu Cooperative has always regarded organizing mass production as its main business. In addition to purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products for the masses, and providing assistance in technology and organization, it also supports mass production with funds. For example, it once purchased more than 2,000 jin of sheep manure and loaned it to 17 military families and impoverished people, who repaid it with millet at the original price of one liang per jin after the autumn harvest. It also lent 120 jin of millet to thirteen laborers to cultivate 29 mu of wasteland, and they harvested 13 shi and 5 dou of grain in the autumn, returning the original amount of millet without interest. It invested more than 300,000 yuan in various workshops, and bank loans were also received by him and then distributed according to needs. In the spring of 1946, 20,000 yuan was borrowed from the bank and distributed to six production brigades as shares for the poor masses, promoting the establishment of small cooperatives and absorbing 340,000 yuan of mass shares, which played a role in organizing mass idle funds. These small-scale credit loans provided great convenience to the masses.

Last year, the income of the masses from sideline products and special products increased. Cotton alone amounted to more than 30,000 jin, worth 9 million yuan, and the profit from textile was more than 1 million yuan. In addition, some workshops had some idle funds and sometimes lent them to the masses for production without interest. Li Jiakui and Deputy Director Liu Xihe organized these idle funds, and also absorbed more than 1 million yuan of fruit shares from the masses. According to the needs of the masses, with the help of the Jinnan Bank, a credit department was established and began operations on February 15. It determined four types of business: deposits, loans, investment, and transactions, which the masses felt were very convenient. Liu Santang said, "If it weren't for the establishment of the credit department, it would be impossible to borrow 190,000 yuan to buy a livestock all at once. Now, if it's not enough, I can withdraw it from the credit department." Shen Hai said, "I sold cotton and deposited it in the credit department, and I can withdraw it at will." Comrade Jiakui personally sought out the masses to promote and explain the absorption of deposits. For example, when he was absorbing deposits from Zhao Sanwen, he was reluctant to use new banknotes. Jiakui said that he would guarantee him new banknotes, so he deposited 3,000 yuan. Within nine days, a total of 300,000 yuan was absorbed from 14 households. Currently, the absorption of deposits and the issuance of loans are still continuing, and it is planned to help the entire village increase more than a dozen livestock. (Juntian, Xinran)

　　合作英雄李甲魁热心组织生产
    北流合作社设信用部
    【本报黎城讯】北流合作社在合作英雄李甲魁同志领导下，一向以组织群众生产为主要业务，除替群众购买原料推销成品在技术上组织上帮助外；并以资金扶植群众生产，如曾收买羊粪二千多斤，贷给十七户军属赤贫，秋收后仍以原价每斤小米一两归还。又贷给十三个劳力一百二十斤小米开荒二十九亩，秋后打粮十三石五斗，无利归还原米。向各作坊共投资三十余万元，银行贷款也是由他领回再根据需要发放。四六年春由银行贷回两万元，分给六个生产大队作为贫苦群众股金，推动成立小型合作社，吸收群众股金三十四万元，起了组织群众游资作用。这些零星的信用借贷，给群众很大方便。
    去年群众副业特产收入增加，仅棉花三万余斤即值洋九百万元，纺织盈利百余万元；另外各作坊有些闲款有时也无利贷给群众生产。李甲魁及副社长刘喜河组织这些游资，又吸收群众果实股一百余万元，根据群众要求，在冀南银行帮助下成立信用部，二月十五日开始营业，确定存款、放款、投资、往来四项业务，群众都感到很活便。刘三堂说：“要不是成立信用部，买一头牲口十九万可一下借不下，现在不够到信用部就能抽出来。”申海说：“我卖了棉花存到信用部，抽动都随便”。甲魁同志并亲自找群众宣传解释吸收存款，如向赵三文吸收时，他舍不得新票，甲魁说保证给他新票，就把三千元存入。九天内计吸收存款十四户三十余万元。现仍在继续吸收存款、发放贷款，计划帮助全村增加牲口十几头。（峻田、心然）
