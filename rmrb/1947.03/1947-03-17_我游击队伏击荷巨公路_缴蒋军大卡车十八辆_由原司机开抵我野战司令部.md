　　Our Guerrillas Ambush the He-Ju Highway
    Seize Eighteen Chiang Army Trucks
    Driven to Our Field Headquarters by Original Drivers
    [Our Newspaper's Frontline Reporter Corps in the Ji-Lu-Yu Area, 16th Dispatch] On the 8th of this month, Eighth Route Army guerrillas ambushed and intercepted eighteen ten-wheeled trucks of the Chiang army on the He-Ju Highway. Except for those destroyed on the spot, the remainder were driven by the captured drivers to General Liu Bocheng's field headquarters to join the motor vehicle brigade. Among the captured vehicles, ten belonged directly to the motor vehicle battalion of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense, all new American GMC and Studebaker vehicles. They were transferred from Nanjing to the Zhengzhou depot last December, arrived in Lanfeng on the 6th of this month, and reached Heze on the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, they were fully loaded with 1,000 kilograms of rice and 40 boxes of mortar shells, heading towards Yuncheng, but after traveling forty *li*, they became spoils of war for the Eighth Route Army. Our ambushing troops were pre-positioned on the side of the road, with machine guns set up. When these vehicles approached, they threw hand grenades and courageously boarded the vehicles, ending the battle in ten minutes. At this time, another eight empty vehicles of the 5th Company of the 1st Light and Heavy Regiment of the Chiang army, returning south from Yuncheng, arrived at our ambush site and were completely eliminated in less than half an hour. More than forty drivers and escorts were all captured. Commander Xie, who directed the battle, immediately offered them condolences and asked if they could drive the vehicles to our army's garrison. Without answering, they happily boarded the vehicles and started the engines.

　　我游击队伏击荷巨公路
    缴蒋军大卡车十八辆
    由原司机开抵我野战司令部
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十六日电】本月八日，八路军游击队在荷巨公路上聚集伏击截获蒋军十轮大卡车十八辆。现除当场被击毁者外，余均由当时俘虏之司机驶抵刘伯承将军之野战司令部，参加汽车大队。截获之汽车中，有十辆直属国民党国防部联勤总部之汽车营，俱系美国吉姆西牌与斯迪浪克新车。去年十二月由南京拨归郑州兵站，本月六日由郑州到兰封，七日到荷泽，八日晨满载大米千斤与迫击炮弹四十箱向郓城进发，不料走了四十里路，即成了八路军的战利品。我伏击部队事先埋伏路侧，架好机枪，待这些汽车走近时，始投出手榴弹，勇猛登车，十分钟即结束战斗。此时适另有由郓城南返之蒋军轻重第一团第五连八辆空车，亦于此时行抵我伏击地点，当即被全部解决，时间相距不到半小时。司机及押车人员四十余人全部被俘，指挥此次战斗之谢连长，当即对彼等予以慰问，并问他们是否可以把汽车开到我军驻地时，他们没有答话就高高兴兴的踏上汽车，开动了马达。
