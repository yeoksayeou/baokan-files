            Overthrow the Evil Landlord
    Compiled by the Women's Association of Dongchen Village (Twelve Months Tune)
    In the first month of the year, the first month is proper, the women of Dongchen are number one. Everyone unites as one, calling on members to work harder. Every member acts as a model, hum ya ai yo, women are turning themselves over today, hum cough.
    In the second month, the spring breeze flutters, the women of Dongchen are doing well. Up at dawn and asleep at midnight, they don't mind hard work and endurance, not afraid of sacrifice and bloodshed. Hum ya cough yo, we settle accounts with the landlord, hum cough.
    In the third month, it is Qingming, evil landlord, you listen. Today we're telling you the truth, tomorrow we'll pull out your list, and then we'll settle the accounts. Hum ya cough yo, resolutely settle the blood debt with you, hum cough.
    In the fourth month, great production begins, the evil landlord is blind. Exploiting the poor for decades, open your dog eyes and see, it's hard for you to exploit again. Hum ya cough yo, today's government is just, hum cough.
    In the fifth month, the wheat turns yellow, pulling the evil landlord to call for his mother. Calling grandma and auntie, never fall for his cries of poverty. Sisters-in-law and sisters, all together, hum ya cough yo, thoroughly settle the blood debt with him, hum cough.
