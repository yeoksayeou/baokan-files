A Model of Hard Struggle
Anecdotes of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's Life
Lin Jian

The following anecdotes are based on accounts from Comrade Pan Kaiwen and Comrade Li Shuhuai, former guards who spent a long time with General Zhu De.

As a great figure, Zhu De devoted most of his time to leading the training and combat of millions of people's armed forces in the Chinese liberated areas, leaving him very little time for leisure. In his daily life, he set a shining example of hard work and simplicity. His personal life was so ordinary and simple that, apart from the daily burden of reviewing telegrams, official documents, and attending meetings, he lived the life of an ordinary farmer. He maintained certain habits, getting up at six o'clock every morning, usually taking a walk outdoors for a while, and then staying in his office, busy with a small bundle of official documents that took up a good six or seven hours to read each day. He ate meals at the designated times. At the front, he had the same diet as every soldier: millet rice with some stir-fried or boiled radishes or potatoes. In Yan'an, it was naturally better. He and his guards reclaimed more than one mu of land in front of the headquarters, and almost all the varieties available from the Guanghua Farm were brought in. This small vegetable garden cultivated more than forty varieties. He worked with his guards; they dug the soil, and he sowed the seeds; they watered, and he used a hoe to clear the ditches. During these farming activities, he often talked about the methods of farming in Sichuan, because he grew up in a farming family, knew and had done it. In this way, the public never had to supply vegetables for his kitchen. To prevent waste, he led the organization of an economic committee, in which the cook, administrator, and chief guard all participated. He personally reviewed the monthly accounts and then called everyone together to discuss ways to save. The Commander-in-Chief often went to the kitchen to inspect. In this small kitchen, there were many jars of all sizes. He instructed the cook on how to make pickled vegetables from fresh vegetables.

He had three cave dwellings in the Yan'an headquarters, simply divided into a bedroom, a reception room, and an office. The reception room initially only had a small table and a few small stools. After the Great Production Movement in 1941, a sofa was added. In this simply furnished reception room, he received Chinese and foreign reporters and guests. Every Sunday, a group of cadres who had spent time with him would come to play, which inevitably meant that the Commander-in-Chief had to entertain them. However, everyone familiar with him knew that the Commander-in-Chief was simple and unwilling to burden the public, so he only instructed his cook to add a few more plates of green vegetables, because it was good enough to be full. Some cadres at the banquet each talked about their own preferences for food, but when they asked the Commander-in-Chief what he liked to eat, the Commander-in-Chief said, "I can eat anything." Naturally, to be more precise, he advocated eating less meat and more green vegetables, because eating too much meat was not good for nutrition and was also expensive at the time. He seemed to like pickled vegetables, chili peppers, and preserved meat.

During the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he liked to play basketball and volleyball with the soldiers. Almost all of his guards knew how to play these games, and they called him "Youth Leader." In Yan'an in recent years, the Commander-in-Chief was rarely seen on the playing field. His only entertainment was dancing, playing chess, and playing cards. When attending public banquets, he also listened to Peking opera and music. His spirit was very strong. I have never seen him close his eyes or look tired and lean on the sofa at evening parties. After he advocated the policy of military reclamation, he went on inspection tours twice a year: in the spring, he went to Nanniwan to inspect the army's land reclamation, and in the autumn, he went to observe their harvest. He often went to farmers' homes to observe and understand their lives. A Sichuan farmer named Old Man Tang established a close friendship with the Commander-in-Chief. After that, he lent his cattle to the army to plow the land, and he came to see the Commander-in-Chief as soon as he arrived in Nanniwan. In addition, he often went to factories to visit. In recent years, he has been very fond of hunting. This sport is mostly held in the early morning and evening, at most twice a week. When he went hunting, he initially rode a chestnut horse. When the Chinese and foreign reporters' visiting group came to Yan'an in 1944, he gave it to a reporter to ride. Later, he rode a big foreign horse captured from a Japanese regimental commander in the Jin-Cha-Ji battle, but during the Great Production Movement, he gave it to a transporter to pull a cart.

His clothes were very casual. We could often see him wearing a set of gray cloth military uniforms in the summer, and in the winter, he simply added a leather overcoat outside his cotton-padded clothes. When seeing off Mrs. Cripps at the airport, he wore a pair of "felt nests" on his feet, which were all authentic Shaanxi products.

He doesn't smoke, but it wasn't always like that. During the Great Production Movement, thrift was advocated, and his perseverance enabled him to quit.

In recent years, nearly two hundred guards have been replaced around the Commander-in-Chief. When these comrades are transferred to work or study, he personally arranges something for almost everyone. He earnestly tells them, even talking about their marriage problems. He advocates choosing a partner for love, not pursuing formality, but choosing someone who can truly work and labor, otherwise, it will be a burden to oneself.

　　艰苦奋斗的典范
    朱总司令生活散记
    林间
    这里所记的，都是由和朱德将军相处很久的先前的卫士潘开文同志和李树槐同志口叙的。
    作为一个伟大的人物，朱德同志除了肩负着领导中国解放区的数百万人民军队的训练和作战外，留给他的生活的游息是很少的。他在日常生活上，为我们竖立了艰苦的典范。他的私生活是那样的平凡和简朴，除了每天繁忙的批阅电报、公文和出席会议担负在肩上外，他过着一个普通农民的生活。他保持着一定的习惯，每天早晨六点钟起床，通常是到户外去散步一会儿，然后就一直留在他的办公室里，让每天足足够看上六七小时的一小捆公文忙着。依照规定的时间吃饭，在前方时是和每一个战士用同等的膳食，小米饭加上一些炒煮后的萝卜或洋芋菜；在延安自然要好些，他和他的警卫员们在总部门前开辟了一亩多地，几乎能够从光华农场弄到的品种都弄来了，这样一小块菜地栽培了四十多种品种。他和警卫员一同劳作，他们掏地，他就点籽；他们浇水，他就用镐拨水沟，在这样的农事劳作中，他向大家经常讲到四川作务庄稼的方法，因为他生长在农家，知道而且做过。这样，公家不曾供给过他的厨房的蔬菜。为了防止浪费，他领导着组织了一个经济委员会，厨师、管理员、卫士长全参加了，每月的结账他亲自过目后，就召集大家研究出节省的办法。总司令经常到厨房内去察看，在这所小厨房内备有不少大大小小的罐子，他指导厨师如何将新鲜的蔬菜制成泡菜。
    他在延安总部有三孔窑洞，简单的分做卧室、会客和办公用。会客室起初只放着一张小桌子和几个小凳子，一九四一年的大生产运动后，方添置了沙发。就在这布置简朴的会客室里，他接见中外记者和来宾。每逢星期天总会有一群和他相处过的干部来这里玩，这样就免不掉要总司令招待了；但是，所有熟悉了的人都知道总司令是简朴的，他不愿加重公家的负担，只令他的厨师多加几盘青菜，反正吃饱就很好了。有些干部在筵席上都各自谈到自己对于吃的嗜好，但是等他们问到总司令喜欢吃什么时，总司令说：“我什么都能吃。”自然，更确切一些说，他是主张少吃肉而多用些青菜，因为肉吃多了于营养无益，在现在也费钱。他似乎喜欢吃泡菜、辣椒和腊肉。
    抗战初期在前方时，他很喜欢同战士们打蓝球和排球，他的警卫员们几乎没有一个人不会这些，他们叫他“青年领袖”。在延安最近这几年，球场上就很少看见总司令了。他的唯一娱乐是跳舞、下棋和玩扑克牌。在出席公共宴会时，他也听平剧和音乐。他的精神十分健壮，我在晚会上从来没有看到他合过眼或是显出困倦而侧在沙发上。在他倡导军队屯垦政策后，他一年有两次出巡：春天，他在南泥湾去察看军队的开荒，秋天则是去观赏他们的收获，他常常到农民家里去，观察和了解他们的生活。一个叫唐老汉的四川农民和总司令建立了亲密的友谊，此后，他将他的牛借给军队耕地，总司令一到南泥湾他就来看他。此外，他常常到工厂里去参观。近年来他很嗜好打猎，这种运动大半在清晨和傍晚举行，每礼拜最多两次。他打猎时起初所骑的是一匹枣红马，一九四四年中外记者参观团来延，他将他送给一位记者去骑用。以后他骑的是从晋察冀战斗中俘获的一个日本联队长的大洋马，但是，在进行大生产运动时，他将它送给运输员去拉大车。
    他的穿着很随便，我们可以经常看到的夏季是一套灰布军服，冬季棉衣外不过加了一件皮大衣，在送行克利浦斯夫人到机场时，他的足上登了一双“毡窝”，这都是道地的陕北出产。
    他是不吸烟的，但从前并不如此。大生产运动时提倡节约，他的坚毅使他将它戒掉。
    近年来，总司令跟前的警卫员已换过将近二百名，当这些同志们调赴工作或是学习的时候，差不多每个人他都要亲自对他们安排一番，他谆谆的嘱咐他们，甚至于讲到他们的结婚问题。他主张谈恋爱择对象，不要追求形式，要选择一个真正能够劳动和工作的，否则，对自己是个累赘。
