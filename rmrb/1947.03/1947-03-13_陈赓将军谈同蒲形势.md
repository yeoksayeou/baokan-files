　　General Chen Geng Discusses the Situation on the Tongpu Front
　　Zhe Ran
　　On the 28th, this reporter met General Chen Geng, victor of six battles, annihilator of 50,000 Chiang and Yan troops, capturer of Huang Zhengcheng, brigade commander of the "Number One Army Under Heaven," and destroyer of the Yan puppet troops who came out in full force. He pointed out that the People's Liberation Army has now gained the initiative on the Tongpu front. The poor combat ability of the repeatedly defeated Chiang and Yan troops has been fully exposed. He cited an example: In the battle on the outskirts of Wenxi City last July, the swift and courageous People's Liberation Army annihilated the 31st Division of the Chiang Hu army in one night with just a barrage of grenades, without using artillery or machine guns. He also said: Chiang Kai-shek believes that the Hu Zongnan army is his most capable force, and Hu Zongnan believes that the "Number One Army Under Heaven" (i.e., the First Division) is his most capable force, and the First Brigade of the "Number One Army Under Heaven" is the most capable of the capable. However, when they came into contact with the People's Liberation Army on the outskirts of Fushan City, the entire First Brigade was wiped out in just half a day and one night (less than 18 hours). Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng, a "professional" graduate of Japanese and German artillery schools, had to be captured in a civilian house along with his mountain guns and machine guns that had not fired a single shot. Speaking of Yan Xishan's army, General Chen said: They are even more useless—wherever our army goes, it is simply like splitting bamboo. Last December, in order to coordinate with the self-defense battle in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, our army advanced into the Jin-Southwest region. Although this was Yan Xishan's old nest, our army liberated seven county towns, including Yonghe, Daning, Xi County, Pu County, Fenxi, and Zhongyang, in just over ten days. The "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny in the area of three or four hundred square miles was swept away, and more than 5,000 officers and soldiers, including Yan army's commander-in-chief Yang Cheng, were captured alive. Last month (January), during the Fen (Yang) Xiao (Yi) campaign, Yan Xishan mobilized all nine divisions, three columns, and other arms, and prepared for Japanese guidance. Yan also personally went to Pingyao to command, and Zhao Chengqian, Wang Jingguo, and others went to the front line to cheer and supervise the battle. However, once our army counterattacked, all seven regiments were annihilated, and other units also suffered heavy losses, retreating in a rout across the board. In Jintun, Fenyang, Zhao Chengqian personally led five battalions to attack, launching five assaults in succession, but was ultimately defeated by our army. The Zhao army suffered heavy losses, while we only suffered three minor injuries.

　　The People's Liberation Army, which has beaten the Chiang and Yan troops to a pulp, has become even stronger in battle. General Chen said: Many local corps have grown into regular corps. With the continuous supply from the two "transport teams" of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, the field armies have become more enriched and modernized. In terms of manpower and material supply, they not only have the wholehearted support of the people in the liberated areas, but also thousands upon thousands of Chiang and Yan officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons have enthusiastically joined our army because of the justice of the patriotic self-defense war in the liberated areas. In the past six months or so, more than 10,000 Chiang and Yan officers and soldiers who have laid down their weapons have joined our army. At a banquet held by the Jiexiu democratic government, a soldier of the "Number One Army Under Heaven" who had laid down his weapon said very emotionally: "I was deceived in the past. At that time, I only died for Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan. Today, I fully understand that I want to fight for the broad masses of people, and I want to be a Eighth Route Army forever." In this way, he turned his original gun around and aimed it at his original officers, and made contributions to the people, and was elected as a hero.

　　Now, Hu Zongnan has transferred the First Division, the 90th Division, the 27th Division, and other units from southern Shanxi to cross the Yellow River and attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. General Chen pointed out that this is precisely a manifestation of the fatal weakness of Hu's army, which is insufficient in strength and robbing Peter to pay Paul. He quoted a meaningful and recent event, saying that last November, Chiang Kai-shek risked attacking Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and Hu Zongnan, like today, transferred seven brigades of troops from southern Shanxi to participate in this gamble. However, when the People's Liberation Army quickly appeared in the Jin-Southwest region, Hu's units, which had not yet gained a firm foothold, immediately felt the danger of being attacked from both sides, and had to hurriedly return east across the river. At this time, the People's Liberation Army had already been waiting in full battle readiness, and the exhausted Chiang-Hu army was subsequently wiped out by us in the Daning and Pu County areas, totaling more than 5,000 people. General Chen said humorously: This time, the westward transfer of the Chiang-Hu army is following the old path of last year, but I believe that he will pay an even greater price than last year.

　　陈赓将军谈同蒲形势
    蔗冉
    二十八日，记者会见六战六捷、歼灭蒋阎军五万、活捉“天下第一军”旅长黄正成、大破倾巢出犯阎伪军的陈赓将军。他指出：目前同蒲前线形势，我军已经获得了主动。屡战屡败的蒋阎军的低劣作战能力，已充分暴露出来。他举例说：去年七月，闻喜城郊一战，神速勇猛的人民解放军，在一个晚上，没有用炮，没有用机关枪，只是一阵手榴弹，蒋胡军三十一师就被歼灭了。他又说：蒋介石认为自己最能打的是胡宗南军，胡宗南认为自己最能打的是“天下第一军”（即第一师），而“天下第一军”的第一旅，又是他们能打中之最能打的。但是，当他们在浮山城郊与人民解放军一接触时，只半天和一个晚上，（不到十八小时）第一旅就全军覆没了，旅长黄正成虽是日本、德国炮兵专科毕业的“行家”，此次也不得不与他那一弹未发的山炮和机枪一道在民房内被俘了。说到阎锡山军，陈将军说：那才更不成话—我军所到之处，简直势如破竹。去年腊月上旬，为策应陕甘岭边区自卫战，我军曾挺进晋西南区。这虽是阎锡山的老巢，我军却在十几天内，一气解放了永和、大宁、隰县、蒲县、汾西、中阳等七座县城。纵横三四百里的地区，“兵农合一”的暴政被一扫而光，阎军上将总指挥杨澄源以下官兵五千余人亦遭生擒。上月（一月）汾（阳）孝（义）战役时，阎锡山动用了所有的九个师，三个纵队，及冲他兵种，并备用日人指导，阎亦亲赴平遥指挥，赵承羡、王靖国等均临前线打气督战。然一经我军反击，七个团全部被歼灭了，其他各部亦遭惨重损失，全线狼狈溃退。其中汾阳靳屯一地，赵承羡虽亲率五个营进攻，前后冲锋达五次之多，但终为我军所击溃，赵军损失惨重，我仅轻伤三人。
    打得蒋阎军落花流水的人民解放军，在战斗中却锻炼得更加强大了。陈将军说：许多地方兵团，已生长壮大为正规兵团，在蒋介石、阎锡山两个“运输队”的源源供给下，各野战军更充实和现代化了。在人力物力的补给上，他们不但有解放区人民全心全力的支援，而且成千成万放下武器的蒋阎军官兵，也因解放区爱国自卫作战的正义性而踊跃的参加了我军。半年多来，放下武器参加我军的蒋阎军官兵已有一万多人。在介休民主政府一次宴会上，“天下第一军”一位放下武器的士兵就非常感动的说：“过去我受骗了，那时我只为蒋介石、胡宗南两个人来送死，今天我完全明白了，我要为广大人民而战，我要永远作一个八路军。”他就这样把他原来的枪，掉转来对准了他原来的官长，而且为人民立了功，并被选成了英雄。
    现在，胡宗南又从晋南抽调第一师、九十师、二十七师等部西渡黄河，进攻陕甘宁边区了。陈将军指出：这正是将胡军兵力不足，挖肉补疮的致命弱点的表现。——他引了一段意味深长而且不久才发生过的事情说：去年十一月，蒋介石冒险进攻陕甘宁，胡宗南也和今天一样，从晋南抽调了七个旅的兵力，去参加这一赌博，但当人民解放军很快出现在晋西南地区时，立足未稳的胡宗南部，立刻感到腹背受敌的危险，乃不得不慌张的闾师东渡，这时人民解放军早已以逸待劳，严阵以待，疲劳不堪的蒋胡军，遂在大宁、蒲县一带相继为我歼灭达五千余人之众。陈将军幽默的说：此次蒋胡军西调，正走着去年的老路，但我相信，他是要比去年付出更大的代价的。
