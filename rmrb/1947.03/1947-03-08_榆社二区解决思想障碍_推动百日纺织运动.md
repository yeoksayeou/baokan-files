　　Yushe Second District Solves Ideological Obstacles
    Promotes Hundred-Day Textile Movement
    [Report from this newspaper, Yushe] Last month, the Second District of Yushe County convened a meeting of over a hundred people, including village chiefs and textile heroes, to discuss the district's Hundred-Day Textile Movement and ensure the completion of the task of producing 3,200 jin of homespun cloth. The meeting first examined ideological issues, discovering that male cadres believed that spinning and weaving were women's affairs and were unwilling to participate in leadership. Young women had lazy tendencies, being unwilling to sit at the spinning wheel. Middle-aged women were afraid of suffering losses and felt that mutual aid in spinning and weaving could not be combined with household chores. Elderly people advocated for a comfortable and leisurely life, each unwilling to be organized. In response to the above problems, the following points were studied: (1) Remove ideological obstacles and organize all women to participate in spinning and weaving under the principle of voluntarism. (2) Each woman should set out a specific plan. (3) Improve technology; each village should have at least one hand-pulled spinning machine. (4) Implement family mutual aid to combine spinning and weaving with household chores.
    [Report from this newspaper, Zanhuang] When organizing textile production in Nanpingwang Village, Second District of this county, many women had concerns. Some believed that the money earned from spinning and weaving would be taken away during struggle sessions, while others thought they were spinning government yarn, and the government would ask them to bear burdens. During meetings, some deliberately shirked participation, and those who knew how to weave said they couldn't, or that someone who could spin four liang of yarn a day claimed they could only spin one and a half. To break down ideological barriers, the leadership launched discussions. Zhu Yuqin's group carried out in-depth mobilization, and everyone discussed their ideological problems, unanimously recognizing that spinning and weaving was to help everyone get rich. After the meeting, Niu Xiuzhu, who had the most concerns, also happily started spinning.

　　榆社二区解决思想障碍
    推动百日纺织运动
    【本报榆社讯】榆社二区于上月中召开全区村长、纺织英雄等百余人会议，讨论该区百日纺织运动，保证完成三千二百斤土布的任务。会议中首先检查思想，发现男干部认为纺织是妇女们的事，不愿参加领导。青年妇女们有坐不到纺车怀里的偷懒情绪，中年妇女中有怕吃亏并感到互助纺织与家庭杂活不能结合，老年人则主张安然自在各各不愿组织。针对以上问题，研究出以下几点：（一）打通思想，在自愿原则下组织全部妇女参加纺织。（二）每个妇女订出具体计划。（三）改进技术，每村至少有一架手拉机。（四）实行家庭互助，达到纺织与家庭杂活相结合。
    【本报赞皇讯】本县二区南平旺村在组织纺织时，许多妇女都有顾虑，有认为纺织赚下钱要被斗争，有认为纺的是官花，政府要叫负担。开会时有些人故意推诿不去参加，会织布的人说织不成，一天能纺四两线说一天纺一两半。领导上为打破思想障碍，发动讨论，朱玉勤小组深入动员，大家谈出思想问题，一致认清纺织是帮助大家发家致富的。会后顾虑最多的牛秀珠也高兴的纺起花来。
