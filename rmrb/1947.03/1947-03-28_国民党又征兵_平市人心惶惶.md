Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd: Beiping News: The Kuomintang authorities are currently conducting the second phase of conscription in Beiping, stipulating that all single sons, public education personnel, and students must serve as soldiers, except for railway technical personnel who meet the needs of their internal war military transportation. All citizens of Beiping are panicking and worried about how to escape this new disaster. The buying and selling of conscripts is now prevalent in Beiping. According to the new recruits who entered the camp last time, they were severely abused. Those who entered the camp had their wallets searched and were put into old military uniforms. In name, they were given twenty-two liang of corn flour a day, but in reality, they only drank two bowls of thin porridge a day. They were not allowed to go out all day, and were subjected to training, beatings, and scolding, like prisoners. This situation has increased the determination of the citizens here to resist conscription this time.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th: Beiping News: Due to the monopoly and manipulation of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, a coal shortage has been created, causing a great lack of electricity in Beiping. The city's coal reserves are only enough to generate electricity for one month. Power outages occur frequently in indefinite areas and at indefinite times, while areas outside the city are often without light all night. Due to the electricity panic, most stores and households use kerosene lamps instead. Kerosene is also in short supply, and the market price has skyrocketed. After the electricity panic began in the middle of last month, the market price of kerosene rose to 2,400 yuan per jin in one day. People buying kerosene line up in long queues in front of various grocery stores, which are extremely crowded.
