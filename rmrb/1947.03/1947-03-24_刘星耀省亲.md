Soldier Liu Xingyao arrived home, and his mother was greatly surprised as soon as he entered the door. This old woman with gray hair had shed countless tears ever since Liu Xingyao was seized by Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Army while selling salt at the market last July. But she never imagined that her own flesh and blood could come before her again. Liu Xingyao really did return. He put down the more than 20 jin of rice that the company had spared from their food savings for him from his shoulder, and stood in front of his mother. His mother carefully looked at Xingyao's face, and tears flowed down. "Mom, don't cry. I'm not serving Old Chiang's army anymore. I'm in the Eighth Route Army now. After being captured by Old Chiang last year, I suffered for half a year. Later, when we were deployed to Huaxian County, I surrendered as soon as we clashed with the Eighth Route Army. After joining the Eighth Route Army, everyone treated me like their own brother. Mom, the Eighth Route Army is the army of us poor people. I will see it through to the end!" His mother wiped away her tears and pulled the propagandist who came with Xingyao to sit down. Just as they were about to have a good talk, the regiment director also arrived. He brought three packages of snacks and eighty jin of rice. Xingyao's mother immediately became uneasy! She was overwhelmed by this most sincere love. The director patiently told her: "The Eighth Route Army is here to save the poor, to give them food to eat. Now fighting Old Chiang is also for the sake of the poor turning themselves over. ..." Before the director could finish speaking, Liu Xingyao's second younger brother jumped up and shouted: "I want to join the Eighth Route Army too." But he was still too young, and it took a lot of persuasion to calm him down. Xingyao was about to return to the team, this time his mother didn't shed a single tear. She thought, she had food to eat, and her child was found, what else could she want? She repeatedly told her son: "Xingyao, do a good job. If we defeat Old Chiang, we poor people will turn ourselves over."

    刘星耀省亲
    杜丙茹
    战士刘星耀到了家，一进门，他母亲大吃一惊。这位头发灰白的老大娘，从去年七月刘星耀在集上卖盐，被蒋介石的六十八军抓走后，她的眼泪也不知流了多少。但从来没有想到她的亲生骨肉还能来到她的面前。刘星耀真的回来了。他把连上从伙食节余里抽出来给他的廿多斤米，从肩上放下，站在母亲面前，母亲仔细看着星耀的脸，眼泪流下来了。“娘，你不要哭。我现在不当老蒋的兵啦。当的是八路军。从去年被老蒋抓走，我算受了半年罪。后来开到滑县，一和八路军接火，我就缴了枪。到了八路军后，大家都像亲兄弟一样待我。娘，八路军是咱穷人的军队。我要干到底！”母亲擦干了眼泪，拉着和星耀一块来的宣传员坐下。当他们刚准备好好说一阵话的时候，团主任也来了。他带来三包点心，还有八十斤米。星耀娘马上不安起来！她为这最真切的爱感动得不知所措。主任耐心的告诉她：“八路军就是救穷人的，叫穷人都有饭吃。现在打老蒋也是为的穷人翻身。……”主任没说完，刘星耀的二弟跳起来就嚷：“我也当八路军。”可是他年纪还小，劝说半天才算拉倒。星耀要归队了，这次母亲一点眼泪也没流。她想吃的有了，孩子又找到了，还想什么呢？她再三叮咛儿子：“星耀好好干吧。把老蒋打败咱穷人就翻了身。”
