　　After careful planning, inspection and promotion
    Our newspaper's production campaign is launched
    [This newspaper reported] The personal production campaign of our newspaper's comrades, after ideological mobilization and organizational preparation, and with each group formulating personal production plans, has been launched enthusiastically since late February. Time allocation: study before breakfast, work from after breakfast to before dinner, and production after dinner. The whole day's life is tense, pleasant, organized and orderly. Comrades in the telecommunications section are charging batteries themselves, completing one case in four hours, and have now completed seventeen cases, earning 12,000 yuan. The research department is collectively making shoes, with two skilled comrades providing guidance, working and resting on time, just like a small factory. They have now made about ten pairs of uppers. In addition, two piglets were also raised. Their plan is: to make 45 pairs of shoes before June, with each pair earning a net profit of at least 600 yuan, for a total profit of 27,000 yuan. Two pigs will be raised for eight months and can be slaughtered for 140 catties. After deducting consumption, the net profit will be 37,000 yuan. Charging three cases per month, charging 30 cases in ten months, will earn a net profit of 21,000 yuan. The total profit above will be 104,200 yuan. After handing in the task of 97,500 yuan, they can exceed the amount by at least 6,700 yuan. The personal plan of Comrade Chen Luyuan of the department is to spin eight qian of yarn every day, one and a half jin per month, and ten jin by the end of the year, which can earn 10,000 yuan, more than enough to complete the task. Other comrades also have precise personal plans. Comrades in the health clinic are rushing to make "Guangming" brand special effects medicine for colds, and have printed more than a thousand copies of the trademark. It is estimated that they can exceed the task by the summer. Before the 20th, the editorial department collectively painted four walls, earning fifty catties of rice. Now they have changed their work and are making "Dazhong" biscuits, which cost 400 yuan per catty, and are selling well, earning over 10,000 yuan. In addition to the collective planting of tobacco in the communications department, which has already begun plowing, Comrade Leng Bing, who came from Yan'an, has also made a new type of large-wheel spinning machine that is cheap and effective, and has begun spinning yarn. Comrade Leng spun seven liang in one day last Sunday. In addition to spinning himself, he has now taught four people. The secretary's office printed more than 2,000 copies of manuscript paper, the general affairs section has spun more than two jin of thread, and a dozen comrades carried more than 1,000 jin of grain on Sunday, earning more than 5,000 yuan. Comrade Feng Yucheng of the telecommunications section carried 85 jin alone. The cooking class is practicing strict economy and, under the conditions of reduced supply, can still create many varieties of food, making everyone very satisfied. The production committee is now preparing to establish a merit badge, ready to record merits and commend models at any time. This week, the various departments have started a total of ten types of production, and the number of spinning wheels has reached twenty-two. The production results have exceeded 1,000 jin of millet. At this rate, the total production task of 30,000 jin of rice can be completed in seven months (according to the newspaper, there are 117 people with production tasks, excluding staff working outside and the cooking class, with an average of about 250 jin per person). The development of the campaign has broken the negative thinking of some comrades who initially thought that newspapers could not produce or wanted to use personal savings to hand in tasks during the mobilization period. The experience of the newspaper in organizing personal production is to formulate personal production plans, conduct regular inspections, help individuals solve specific difficulties (such as tools and raw materials), promote production enthusiasm, commend models, launch merit campaigns, and give play to everyone's skills.
