Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: According to visitors from Changchun, a month ago, when the Democratic Allied Army entered Bula Hai, Misha Zi and other places near Changchun, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Changchun were panic-stricken, and prices soared. The citizens of Changchun stood waiting for the Democratic Allied Army to arrive all day long. Even after repeated expulsions by armed military police, they did not disperse for a long time. Du Yuming fabricated false battle reports every day in order to stabilize the morale. However, Chiang's soldiers who retreated and were wounded from the front line brought the real situation to the citizens of Changchun. A soldier of the New First Army who returned from the front line said, "Don't believe their propaganda about winning counterattacks anymore. We were really beaten back." A medic from the 88th Division of the 71st Army said, "Don't run when the Eighth Route Army comes. Just take off your hat (meaning surrender)." In order to prevent soaring prices, the Chiang clique authorities in Changchun arrested seven grain merchants in one day, but grain prices still soared seven or eight times in two days. Many items are not allowed to be bought and sold freely, and leather is also considered military supplies. The citizens of Changchun suffered deeply from the Chiang disaster, and they spread the word: "Once the Eighth Route Army comes in this time, we can't let them leave again!"

    我军进抵长春附近时
    蒋家当局惊慌万状市民伫立期待我军
    【新华社东北二十二日电】据长春来客谈，一月前当民主联军进入长春附近布拉海、米沙子等地时，长春蒋家当局惊慌万状，物价暴涨不已。长春市民整日伫立期待民主联军来到。虽经持枪军警一再驱逐，亦很久不散。杜聿明为了安定民心，每日捏造假战报。而从前线败退和负伤的蒋军士兵则带给长春市民以真实的情况。新一军一个从前线回去的士兵说：“再不要信他们宣传什么反击获胜了，我们可真是被人家打回来的。”七一军八八师一个卫生兵说：“八路来了不要跑，把帽子一摘（投降的意思）就成了。”长春蒋记当局为了防止物价暴涨，曾在一天中抓捕七家粮商，可是粮价在两天内仍飞涨七八倍。平进很多物品不准自由买卖，皮革亦算作军用品。长春市民深受蒋灾之苦，纷纷传说：“八路这次进来可再不让走了！”
