    How the Hejian Militia Was Transformed?
    Wang Boying
    Hejian is a market town in the second district of Lin County, with a population of over 700, and the militia accounts for 6% of the village's population. It was established after liberation in 1943. At that time, twelve poor peasants participated. Later, with the development of mass movements, it gradually grew to forty-two members. They had bravely fought against the Hu Lu troops (a common term for puppet soldiers). However, due to a lack of political education, their concept of serving the masses was vague. They became special after making contributions, alienated from the masses, and even opposed the farmers' association.
    To solve this problem, the cadres, on the one hand, had all the militiamen hold a meeting to discuss what the militia was for and whether it was the same as the Hu Lu troops. Everyone agreed that the militia was an armed force of peasants working for the benefit of the people, while the Hu Lu troops worked for the landlords, so they were not the same. Then, they discussed who the farmers' association worked for and whether it was like their own family. Everyone said: The farmers' association works for us poor people, and the farmers' association and the militia are all one family. After such discussions, everyone understood that opposing the farmers' association meant opposing their own people. At the same time, they criticized the alienation from the masses by Lü Heidan and three others, and everyone also examined their own mistakes. Militia member Wang Qinghe said: "The farmers' association is discussing the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, and we are always against it. We usually put on airs and are alienated from the masses. No wonder the masses don't talk to us when they see us. If we continue like this, it will be dangerous! Not only will we not be able to be militiamen, but the farmers' association will not want us either."
    On the other hand, the farmers' association and the masses were allowed to hold meetings to raise as many opinions as possible about the militia. The unanimous call was: Our village's militia is really putting on airs, loafing around, and we have to expel a few of them. The militiamen, hearing the speeches of the masses outside the house, deeply felt the danger of their alienation from the masses and were only afraid of being expelled themselves. Amidst the anger of the masses, the town leader said: "Our town's militia has made many mistakes, but in the past, they risked their lives to fight the Hu Lu troops and protect everyone, making no small contribution; and they shed blood. We cannot erase their merits! Their current mistakes can be corrected. We cannot expel them just because they have problems. Now we will ask them to change, and if they cannot change, then we will expel them." After the town leader said this, everyone suddenly realized and said in unison: "The town leader has said it very clearly, we cannot forget their contributions." After such mediation and education, the masses now cherish the militia even more, and the militia has also recognized that they are a peasant armed force serving the masses. Everyone is very united and in good spirits.

    合涧民兵是怎样改造的？
    王伯英
    合涧是林县二区的一个集镇，有七百多口人，民兵占全村人口的百分之六。成立于一九四三年解放以后。当时有十二个贫苦农民参加。以后随着群运开展，逐渐发展到四十二个。他们曾英勇地与胡掳队（伪军俗称）作过战。但因缺乏政治教育，为群众服务的观点模糊，有了功就特殊化起来，脱离群众，甚至与农会对立。
    干部为解决这一问题，一方面让民兵全体开会讨论民兵是干啥的？是不是和胡掳队一样？大家一致认为民兵是给老百姓办事的农民武装，胡掳队是给地主办事，可不一样。接着又讨论农会是给谁办事，是不是和咱一家人？大家说：农会是给咱穷人办事，农会民兵都是一家人。经过这样讨论，大家明确了反对农会就是反对自己人。同时对吕黑蛋等四人的脱离群众作了批评，各个人又检讨了自己的错误。民兵王青和说：“农会讨论分斗争果实，咱尽反对，平时又头大，脱离群众，怪不得群众一见咱就不说话了。再搞下去可危险呀！不但民兵当不成，农会也不要咱了。”
    另一方面让农会及群众开会对民兵有意见尽量提，大家一致的呼声是：咱村民兵实在有些头大，游手好闲，不开除几个不行。民兵们在屋外听到群众的发言，深感自己脱离群众的危险，光怕开除了自己。在群众的怒火下，镇长说：“咱镇民兵的错误是不少，可是他们过去不顾命的去打胡掳队，保卫大家，出力不小；并且流了血，他们的功劳我们可不能抹煞呀！他们现在的错误是能改正的，咱们不可因为他们有毛病就开除。现在咱叫他们改，改不了再开除。”镇长这样一说后，大家恍然大悟，异口同声的说：“镇长说得很透彻，咱们可不能忘了他们的功劳。”经过这样调解教育，群众现在对民兵更加爱护，民兵也认清了自己是为群众服务的农民武装。大家很团结，情绪很好。
