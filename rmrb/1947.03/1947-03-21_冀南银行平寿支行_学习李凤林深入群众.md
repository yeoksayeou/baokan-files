    Ping Shou Branch of the Jinnan Bank
    Studies Li Fenglin's Method of Immersing Himself Among the Masses
    [This newspaper reports] In the past, some comrades in the Ping Shou Branch of the Jinnan Bank believed that the bank was simply about receiving and issuing loans, neglecting to cooperate with mass movements, resulting in a phenomenon of sitting in the office. Some comrades felt that there was no future in bank work and requested job transfers. However, Comrade Li Fenglin, a worker-peasant cadre who newly joined the bank last winter, paid attention to mass work. Every time he went to the countryside to collect payments or inspect loans, he first contacted the district to cooperate with the central work of each period. During a loan inspection in the @Hui Village of the third district of Pingding, he discovered that the special agent Wang Haiwei had borrowed 20,000 yuan in silver dollars and used the name of production to infiltrate the cooperative to carry out special agent activities. He immediately handed over the special agent Wang Haiwei for public trial by the masses. The leadership called on all cadres to learn from his style of immersing himself among the masses. Now all comrades in the bank are willing to combine their work with approaching the masses and serving the masses, and there has been a great change in the work and style of the office.

    冀南银行平寿支行
    学习李凤林深入群众
    【本报讯】冀南银行平寿支行过去有些同志认为银行是单纯收放贷款，忽视配合群运，形成坐机关现象。有些同志认为银行工作没出路，要求调动工作。但去冬新参加银行工作的工农干部李凤林同志却注意群众工作，每次下乡收款或检查贷款时，先与区上接头，配合各时期的中心工作。在平定三区＠会村检查贷款中，发现特务王海味贷洋两万元，假借生产名义钻入合作社进行特务活动，即将特务王海味交给群众公审。领导上号召全体干部学习他这种深入群众的作风。现该行全体同志都愿结合岗位工作，接近群众，为群众服务，机关工作与作风有很大转变。
