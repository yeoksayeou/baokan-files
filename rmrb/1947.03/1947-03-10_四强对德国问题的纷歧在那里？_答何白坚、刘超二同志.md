　　Regarding the German question, there has always been a struggle between two lines. One line is to thoroughly implement the resolutions of the Crimea Conference and Potsdam, eradicate the socioeconomic foundation of fascism, appropriately use in-kind reparations to compensate the Allied countries for war losses, and establish a democratic and unified new Germany before a peace treaty can be concluded. The other line is to immediately conclude a peace treaty and preserve the remnants of fascist forces, not to provide reasonable compensation to the Allied countries that suffered the greatest war damage, and to establish a divided and fragmented German federation in order to cultivate new roots for international disputes on the European continent. The Soviet Union is the adherent of the former line, the United States is the creator of the latter line, and Britain and France, each according to their own interests, agree with the Soviet Union in some respects and echo the United States in others.

　　The communique of the Crimea Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on February 11, 1945, stated: "It is our unwavering purpose to destroy German militarism and Nazism and to ensure that Germany will never again disturb world peace. We are determined to disarm and disband all German armed forces; to permanently eradicate the German General Staff, which has repeatedly plotted to revive German militarism; to remove or destroy all German military equipment; to eliminate or control all German industries that could be used for military production; to fairly and swiftly punish all war criminals and demand in-kind reparations for the damage caused by the Germans; to eliminate the Nazi Party, Nazi laws, organizations, and institutions; to remove all Nazi and militaristic influences from public service and the cultural and economic life of the German people; and, in conjunction with the above, to implement other measures necessary for the future peace and world security of Germany. Our purpose is not to destroy the German people, but only when Nazism and militarism are eradicated will the German people have the hope of living and working in peace and occupying a place in a harmonious world." The communique of the Potsdam Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on August 3 of the same year also decided: (1) To destroy Germany as a military state, to deprive it of all potential for remanufacturing war, to completely disarm it and abolish its military administration, and to eliminate or control all German industries. (2) To compel Germany to compensate the United Nations for the losses and difficulties it has caused to the greatest extent possible, with the Allied countries taking over German industries, capital, and equipment. (3) To have the Allied countries deal with the German fleet and merchant ships. (4) To give Konigsberg and its surrounding areas to the Soviet Union. (5) To temporarily extend the western border of Poland to the Oder River, including Danzig, pending final resolution at the peace conference.

　　Molotov's statement at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference on July 10 of last year on the "Fundamental Policies for Dealing with Germany" not only repeatedly clarified the Soviet Union's firm intention to implement the Crimea and Potsdam agreements, but also clearly stated: "Before signing a peace treaty with Germany, a unified German government must be established," and this government should be "democratic, able to eradicate all remnants of fascism in Germany, and able to fulfill Germany's obligations to the United Nations, foremost of which is the obligation to pay reparations."

　　Regarding the Ruhr area of Germany, Molotov also advocated that it should remain in the possession of democratic Germany, but with four-power supervision to prevent the revival of its military industry. The eastern part of Germany, such as Silesia and Danzig, should be ceded to Poland.

　　According to Marshall's recent announcement, the U.S. opinion is basically to revise the Crimea and Potsdam resolutions in accordance with Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart, Germany, on September 6 of last year. Byrnes' so-called主張(zhǔzhāng - advocacy) are: (1) As long as Germany acknowledges that it will simply not engage in military revival and disarm for 25 years, a peace treaty can be concluded in the shortest possible time, without the need to eradicate the residual forces of fascism in politics, economy, and culture, and 40 years (as advocated by the Soviet Union) of disarmament. (2) Silesia, Konigsberg, Danzig and other eastern territories of Germany should not be ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union, which have suffered deeply from the war; in other words, Germany is allowed to retain its forward positions against the Soviet Union and Poland. (3) Opposing France's claims to the Ruhr and Rhineland regions. (4) Germany should not give the Soviet Union one million U.S. dollars in reparations in accordance with the Crimea decision, and reparations cannot be converted from the industrial material objects of the Western occupation zones (U.S., Britain, and France). (5) To establish a divided and fragmented "German Federation."

　　In the past, British opinions mostly followed the United States. Bevin agreed with the U.S. "25-year treaty", agreed to the "German Federation", and advocated that "the Ruhr-Rhine and Westphalia industrial areas should politically belong to Germany, while economically, a commission of allied nations consisting of Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands should implement control for 50 years." Recently, due to the signing of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, consultations on the revision of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty, as well as dissatisfaction with Bevin's foreign policy within Britain, and the intensification of U.S.-British contradictions, Britain's claims on the German question have had to be somewhat modified. Bevin also reiterated during a debate on foreign policy in the British House of Commons that he wanted to "prevent the recurrence of German aggression" and "does not oppose French demands."

　　There are two opinions in France regarding the German question. One is that of Bidault, who proposed to the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference on April 25 of last year that the Ruhr should be politically and economically separated from Germany, that four-power supervision should be established, and that the customs and industry of the Rhineland and Saar regions should also be merged with France. Opposing Germany's establishment of any form of central government. The other opinion is that of French Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez, who called for: "In accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, Nazism in Germany should be completely and immediately purged. Germany should immediately abolish its armaments, eliminate its war industries, and strictly control any heavy industry left to it. In particular, the Allied powers' control over the Ruhr area should transform this arsenal of Greater Germanism into an international organization, and first of all, work for the construction of those countries that have suffered from German aggression."

　　四强对德国问题的纷歧在那里？
    ——答何白坚、刘超二同志
    对于德国的问题，一直存在着两条路线的斗争，一条是要彻底实行克里米亚会议和波茨顿的决议，根绝法西斯社会经济的基础，适当的用实物赔偿盟国所受战祸损失，建立民主统一的新德国后才能缔结和约；另外一条是要立即缔结和约并保存法西斯的残余力量。不给予受战祸最大的盟国以合理的赔偿，成立分裂割据的德意志联邦，以培植欧洲大陆国际纠纷的新根苗。苏联是前一路线的坚持者，美国是后一路线的制造者，英法则各按其本身利益，某些地方同意苏联，某些地方又附和美国。
    一九四五年二月十一日，美英苏的克里米亚会议的公报中说：“我们坚持不移的目的，是摧毁德国军国主义及纳粹主义，并保证使德国永远不能再扰乱世界和平。我们决心解除并解散德国一切武装部队；永远根除一再策谋复活德国军国主义的德国总参谋部；移去或摧毁德国一切军事装备；消除或管制德国可能当作军事生产的一切工业；公平和迅速惩办一切战争罪犯，并对德国人所造成的破坏索取实物赔偿；消灭纳粹党、纳粹法律、组织和制度；清除公务机关及德国人民文化和经济生活中的一切纳粹主义及军国主义的影响；在配合上述种种，对德国实行未来和平及世界安全所必需的其他措施。我们的目的不是消灭德国人民，但只有在纳粹主义与军国主义被根绝时，德国人民才有安居乐业及在和谐世界中占一地位的希望”。同年八月三日的美英苏波茨顿会议公报中亦决定：（一）毁灭作为军事国家的德国，决定剥夺其一切可用作再制造战争的潜在力，完全解除其武装与废除其军政，消除或控制德国一切工业。（二）迫使德国赔偿它对联合国家所造成的损失与困难至可能的最大限度，由盟国接管德国的工业、资本、装备。（三）由盟国处理德国舰队与商船。（四）将哥尼斯堡及其附近地区给予苏联。（五）在和平会议最后解决以前，波兰西部边界暂时扩展至奥得河，但泽包括在内。
    莫洛托夫去年七月十日在巴黎外长会议对“处理德国根本方针”的声明，除了反复阐明苏联坚决要实现克里米亚和波茨顿的协议外，而且明确的说：“在与德国签订和约之前，必须建立统一的德国政府”而且这个政府应当是“民主的，能够铲除法西斯主义在德国的一切残余，能够履行德国对联合国的义务。其中，首先是对赔款的义务。”
    对于德国鲁尔区域，莫洛托夫亦主张仍归民主德国保有，但建立四强监督，以防止其军事工业的复活。德国东部西里西亚但泽等地方，应划归波兰。
    美国方面的意见，据马歇尔日前宣布，基本上要按照去年九月六日贝纳斯在德境斯图加特的讲演来修改克里米亚与波茨顿决议。所谓贝纳斯的主张是：（一）只要德国承认单纯的不作军事复兴，解除武装二十五年，就可以在最短期内缔结和约，而不须根绝法西斯在政治、经济、文化的残存势力和四十年（苏联主张）解除武装。（二）西里西亚，哥尼斯堡、但泽等德国东部领土，不割与受祸深重的波兰与苏联、换句话说，容许德国保留反苏反波的前哨阵地。（三）反对法国对于鲁尔、莱因地区的主张。（四）德国不应依照克里米亚决定给予苏联一百万万美元数目的赔偿而且赔款也不能拿西方占领区（美英法）的工业实物折算。（五）建立一个分裂的割据的“德意志联邦”。
    英国的意见从前大多是跟着美国走的，贝文赞成美国的“廿五年条约”，同意“德意志联邦”、主张“鲁尔莱因和威斯特利亚工业区，在政治上属于德国，在经济上则由英法比荷四国成立盟国委员会，实施管制五十年”。最近由于英法同盟条约的签订，苏英修改盟约的咨商，以及英国国内对贝文外交政策的不满，和美英矛盾的加剧，已使英国对于德国问题的主张，不能不有所修改，日前在英下院辩论外交政策的贝文也重复的说要“防止德国的侵略再起”，“并不反对法国要求”。
    法国对德国问题的态度是有两种意见的，一种是比道尔在去年四月二十五日向巴黎外长会议提出来的，主张鲁尔在政治上经济上脱离德国，建立四强监督，并由法国占领莱因，萨尔区域的关税及工业亦应与法国合并。反对德国建立任何形式的中央政府。另一种意见是法国副总理，法共领袖多列士的主张，他呼吁：“依照波茨顿协定的精神，完全和立即肃清德国的纳粹主义，德国应立即废除军备，消灭其战争工业，并严格管制留给它的任何重工业。特别是盟国对鲁尔区的管制，要使这个大日尔曼主义的兵工厂，转变成为国际组织，并首先为遭受德国侵犯牺牲之各国的建设而工作”。
