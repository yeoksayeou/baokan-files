    【Benbao Taihang Nineteenth Electric】 Comrade Sun Layao, a model militiaman in the struggle against the enemy in the Taigu border area, heroically sacrificed himself in the battle to defend Hao Village on the 25th of last month. Upon hearing the news, the surrounding people mourned in unison. Comrade Layao, a native of Fancun, came from a poor peasant family. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was an excellent underground worker for us. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas. Comrade Layao returned to his village and actively participated in the militia, persevering in the struggle against the enemy in the border area. In March of last year, he led 29 militiamen to repel more than 60 enemies. In June, when cooperating with our army to attack the enemy's small stronghold south of Fancun, he rescued 12 wounded soldiers single-handedly amidst a hail of bullets. In the famous Zhongshan Geta defense battle, he fought side by side with Comrade Jia Maohou, repelling six enemy assaults, killing 11 enemies, and victoriously crushing the enemy's attempt to seize grain from Fancun. He also actively participated in other battles such as the ambush in Dongjia.
