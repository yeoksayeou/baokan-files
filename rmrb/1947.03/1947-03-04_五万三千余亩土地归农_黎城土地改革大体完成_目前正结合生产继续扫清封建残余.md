    Activating the "Backward" is Key to Checking Reductions in Old Areas
　　Over 53,000 Mu of Land Returned to Farmers
    Licheng Land Reform Largely Completed
    Continuing to Eliminate Feudal Remnants in Conjunction with Production
    [Report from this newspaper, Licheng] The movement to level the rich/poor gap in Licheng, which began in December of last year, quickly spread from points to the entire county, sparking a fierce emancipation movement. After reasoning, settling accounts, and struggling against treacherous landlords and feudal despots, 50,000 farmers recovered a large amount of fruit. According to statistics from 164 administrative villages in the county, this included 53,890 mu of land, over 24,000 tile-roofed houses, over 3,000 earthen cave dwellings, over 1,700 head of livestock, over 24,000 sheep, over 58,800 shi of grain, over 352,000 silver yuan, over 5.45 million Jichaopiao, and many other items such as clothing and furniture. After democratic discussion, this fruit was first used to fill the gaps and then level the land, and after being distributed according to need, the farmers were thoroughly emancipated. The 1,631 extremely poor households (4,524 people) in the county originally had 4,021.6 mu of land, which increased to 15,754.9 mu after the movement, averaging 3.48 mu per person, mostly rising to the level of middle peasants. There were still 361 extremely poor households with an average of only 2.7 mu of land per person, rising to the level of poor peasants. 6,583 poor peasant households in the county, including 22,648 people, rose to the level of middle peasants, occupying 73,328 mu of land after the movement (an increase of 30,398.2 mu), averaging 3.23 mu per person. 339 households of honorably discharged servicemen, 592 people, received 1,945.6 mu of land after the movement. The original 167 extremely poor peasant households all rose to the level of middle peasants. Nearly 30,000 farmers participated in this movement, including over 20,000 women farmers. In the struggle to thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation, a large number of core cadres were mobilized and cultivated. According to statistics from 158 villages, there were 474 such cadres. The old cadres were transformed, with 168 transformed cadres according to statistics from 72 villages. 7,154 activists emerged (5,420 men and 1,734 women), including 580 hired laborers, 939 extremely poor peasants, 2,765 poor peasants, 2,726 middle peasants, and 144 small merchants. The transformed cadres and the newly cultivated poor hired laborer activists formed a strong leading backbone in the movement, mobilizing and uniting the vast majority of backward and honest peasants, forming the main force for thoroughly eliminating feudalism in the old areas. Experience has shown that without the mobilization of backward peasants and the cultivation of a large number of poor hired laborer activists, it is not easy, or even impossible, to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and achieve land reform. Licheng began with the idea of uniting 90% of the farmers, paying attention to the mobilization of backward peasants, but after the movement unfolded, the leadership gradually clarified that deeply mobilizing the backward, relying on poor tenants and hired laborers as the backbone, and uniting the vast majority of middle peasants was the main key to completing land reform. Under the slogans of "middle and poor peasants are one family, unite in struggle, unite for emancipation," land reform was successfully completed. Now the emancipated farmers are continuing to carry out the "digging air raid shelters" movement with a joyful mood, combining production to thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants. (Ke Hong)

    发动“落后”是老区查减的关键
　　五万三千余亩土地归农
    黎城土地改革大体完成
    目前正结合生产继续扫清封建残余
    【本报黎城讯】黎城的填平补贫运动，从去年十二月开始，迅速由点到面，掀起了遍及全县的猛烈的翻身运动，五万农民经过对奸霸封建地主说理清算斗争，收回了大批果实，据全县一百六十四个行政村统计，计收回土地五万三千八百九十亩，瓦房二万四千余间，土窑三千余孔，牲口一千七百余头，羊二万四千余只，粮食五万八千八百余石，银洋三十五万二千余元，冀钞五百四十五万余元，及衣服桌椅等多件。这些果实经过民主讨论，先填圪道后铺平，按需分配以后，农民彻底翻透了身。全县一千六百卅一户赤贫（四千五百二十四人）原有地四千零二十一亩六分，运动后增加到一万五千七百五十四亩九分，每人平均三亩四分八厘，大部升为中农，还有三百六十一户赤贫每人只平均二亩七分地，升为贫农。全县贫农升中农的有六千五百八十三户，包括二万二千六百四十八口人，运动后占有土地七万三千三百二十八亩，（增加土地三万零三百九十八亩二分）每人平均三亩二分三厘。荣退军人三百三十九户，五百九十二口人，运动后分得土地一千九百四十五亩六分。原有一百六十七户赤贫农，均升为中农。这次参加运动的农民近三万人，农民妇女二万余人，在彻底消灭封建剥削斗争中，发动与培养出大批核心干部，据一百五十八个村统计：即有四百七十四个。改造了旧有的干部，据七十二个村统计，即有一百六十八个。涌现出积极分子七千一百五十四个；（男五千四百二十个，女一千七百三十四个）包括雇工五百八十个，赤贫农九百三十九个，贫农二千七百六十五个，中农二千七百二十六个，小商人一百四十四个。改造过来的干部与新培养的雇贫积极分子，在运动中形成了强固的领导骨干，发动与团结了广大的落后老实农民，形成老区彻底消灭封建的主要力量。经验证明，没有落后农民的发动与培养大批雇贫积极分子，对贯彻最后消灭封建，实现土地改革是不容易的，甚至是不可能的。黎城开始是从团结百分之九十农民的思想出发，注意了落后农民的发动，但运动开展以后，领导上即逐渐明确了深入发动落后依靠贫佃雇农为骨干，团结广大中农，是完成土地改革的主要关键。在中贫农是一家，团结斗争，团结翻身的口号下，胜利地完成了土地改革。现翻身农民正以愉快的情绪，继续开展挖“防空洞”运动，结合生产，彻底扫清封建残余。（克虹）
