Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 3rd: TASS News Agency reported: Thomas, a Labor Party member of Parliament and executive member of the National Union of Teachers of England, who returned to England after traveling in Greece for several months, reported to foreign journalists on February 20 that the islands around Greece were crowded with Greeks who were dissatisfied with the Greek government and fled there. The atmosphere in Athens made any democrat sick, and the situation in the provinces was even worse. He was very surprised that there was no sign of restoration and rehabilitation in Greece. Two years after the end of the war, the roads in Greece were still extremely bad, and no new houses had been built. There was shocking poverty everywhere. After detailing the assassinations, arrests, and beatings by the Greek authorities, Thomas said: "The Greek government, through its own policies, has created everything it fears. The Greek government, through tyranny and persecution, has driven those belonging to the middle faction to the left." Thomas continued to describe his travels in the guerrilla area: "The Greek guerrillas control all the mountainous areas of Greece, which account for half of the entire territory of Greece. The life of the people in the guerrilla area is happy and free." Thomas had a long conversation with General Markos, commander-in-chief of the guerrillas, who told him: "We do not want to establish a country, but we want the people to have freedom of speech, action, and resistance against their own reactionary government." If British troops remain in Greece, this will be impossible because the government is carrying out persecution under the cover of British troops." Thomas said: The guerrillas' munitions and artillery are good, and these are all spoils of war seized from the government army.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 5th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: In view of the plight of the Greek royalists, the United States officially announced on the 4th that it would guarantee aid to Greece, one of the conditions being that British troops must remain in Greece. Previously, the British side had notified the United States that the economic situation in Greece was serious and that it was not easy for Britain to bear it alone. If the United States did not provide support, it would consider other measures.

　　人民游击队力量强大
    希腊国土一半成解放区
    反动派统治区惊人贫穷一片黑暗
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社讯：在希腊游历数月返回英伦的工党议员及英全国教师联合会执委汤姆斯，在二月二十日曾向外国记者报告希腊情况称：希腊周围的岛屿，都拥挤着不满希腊政府而避往该地的希人，雅典的气象使任何民主人士作呕，而各省情况尤糟，希腊毫无恢复善后的痕迹，令他甚为惊奇。战争结束业已两年，希腊道路仍恶劣之极，一间新屋也没有建造起来，到处都是惊人的贫穷。在详述了希腊当局的暗杀逮捕与殴打等情况之后，汤氏说：“希腊政府由其自己的政策，制造了他所害怕的一切，希腊政府以暴虐与迫害将那些属于中派的人也驱向左顷”。汤氏继述他在游击区游历的情形说：“希腊游击队控制了希腊的全部山地，这些区域占希腊全境之半。在游击区人民的生活是愉快而自由”。汤氏曾与游击队总司令马尔科斯将军等长谈，马将军告诉他：“我们不要建立一个国家，但我们要人民有言论行动及反抗他们自己反动政府的自由”，如果英军留在希腊，这种事情无从实现，因为政府在英军掩护下进行迫害”。汤氏说：游击队的军火大炮均不错，这些都是缴获自政府军的战利品。
    【新华社延安五日电】综合各方讯：鉴于希腊保皇派处境之窘迫，美国已于四日正式宣布保证给予希腊援助，其条件之一为英军须留驻希境。前此英方曾照会美国谓，希腊经济情况严重，英国不易独负，如美方不予支持，则将考虑其他措施。
