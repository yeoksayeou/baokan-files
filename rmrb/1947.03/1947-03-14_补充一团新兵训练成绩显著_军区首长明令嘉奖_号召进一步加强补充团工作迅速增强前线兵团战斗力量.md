　　The First Supplementary Regiment's Supplementary Soldiers Achieve Remarkable Training Results
    Military Region Leaders Issue Commendation
    Calling for Further Strengthening of Supplementary Regiment Work to Rapidly Enhance the Combat Power of Frontline Corps
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The new soldiers of the First Supplementary Regiment (now renamed the Third Regiment) of the Military Region who enlisted last November, under the leadership of Regiment Commander Ren and Political Commissar Liang, after more than a month of arduous training, completed their training period at the beginning of January this year. At the request of all officers and soldiers of the regiment, they went to the front lines to join the field army. According to recent reports from the troops, the new soldiers of the regiment showed a high degree of class consciousness and a spirit of discipline, hard work, and endurance, which was highly praised by the leaders of the troops. Their specific performances are as follows: 1. High political enthusiasm; 95% have joined the Party. 2. Military actions are generally skilled and have a foundation. Due to the tense military life, they can quickly participate in combat and have the preliminary level of a general combatant. 3. Good mass discipline and a spirit of hard work and endurance. In a continuous combat environment of one month, they could not buy vegetables to eat, but there were no complaints, and their morale remained high. No one showed timidity or straggling. 4. Obey organizational transfers, regardless of the need for organization, and are not affected by personal feelings or hometown relationships. 5. After the regiment reached the front lines, they successively requested to quickly join the army and participate in combat, and requested to be assigned to corps with the most frequent combat missions and the largest casualties.
    The leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region believe that the regiment's cadres are well-educated and have achieved remarkable results, and hereby issue a commendation to commend them. They also called for further strengthening the work of each supplementary regiment, so that new soldiers can receive the necessary political and military-technical training, and rapidly enhance the combat power of frontline corps. The main experiences of Supplementary Regiment One are now introduced as follows:
    1. Appropriate short-term (generally one month) training was carried out. This training focused on ideological education to improve the political awareness of new soldiers. Emphasis was placed on turning over and recalling the past and recognizing the essence of the people's army. On the basis of improving political awareness, military-technical training was strengthened.
    2. The cadres of the supplementary regiment have a clear understanding of serving the front lines and the war, and have a high degree of political responsibility. Their goal is not only to send new soldiers to the front lines, but also to be responsible for training them into combatants of the People's Army with a high degree of political consciousness, who can actively participate in the field army, and can skillfully use weapons for combat. They are very concerned about and care for the new soldiers, and have established a revolutionary relationship with the new soldiers, setting an example in everything and influencing the soldiers.
    Military training abandoned all formal education (such as overemphasizing formal drills, etc.), and with the principle of less but more refined, focused on the arduous training of the three major skills and strict military life training. Time was very tight, and not a single second was wasted. (Wang Wenzhi)

　　补充一团新兵训练成绩显著
    军区首长明令嘉奖
    号召进一步加强补充团工作迅速增强前线兵团战斗力量
    【本报特讯】军区补充第一团（现改为第三团）去年十一月入伍的新战士，在该团任团长、梁政委领导下，经一个多月的苦练，于今年元月初训练期满，在全团官兵请求下，开赴前线参加野战军。近据部队反映，该团新战士在前方表现了高度的阶级觉悟及遵守纪律、吃苦耐劳的精神，深得部队首长赞许，其具体表现是：一、政治情绪很高，百分之九十五均已加入部队。二、军事动作一般熟练有基础，军事生活紧张，均能迅速参加战斗，具有一般战斗员的初步水平。三、群众纪律好，吃苦耐劳精神好，在一个月的连续战斗环境下，买不到菜吃，都无怨言，情绪始终高涨，无一人表现畏缩和掉队。四、服从组织调动，任凭需要编组，不因私情同乡关系受何影响。五、该团达到前线后，纷纷要求迅速入伍参加战斗，并要求补充到战斗任务最频繁和伤亡较大的兵团中去。
    晋冀鲁豫军区首长认为该团干部教育得法，成绩卓著，特予明令嘉奖，以资表扬。并号召进一步加强各补团工作，使新战士得到政治上军事技术上必要的锻炼，迅速增强前线兵团的战斗力量。现将补一团主要经验介绍如下：
    一、进行了适当的短期（一般为一个月）训练，这一训练是以思想教育提高新战士政治觉悟为主。着重翻身回忆和认识人民军队本质，在提高政治觉悟基础上，加强军事技术的训练。
    二、补充团干部有明确的为前线为战争服务的思想，有高度的政治责任心，他们的目标是不仅把新兵送到前线，而且要负责把他们训练成为有高度政治自觉的人民军队的战斗员，能积极参加野战兵团，能熟练的使用武器进行战斗。他们对新战士非常关心与爱护，与新战士建立了革命的感情，事事以身作则，影响战士。
    军事训练抛弃了一切形式教育（如偏重制式教练等），以少而精的原则，注重于三大技卫的苦练和严格军事生活的锻炼，时间抓得很紧，一分一秒钟都不让浪费。（王文治）
