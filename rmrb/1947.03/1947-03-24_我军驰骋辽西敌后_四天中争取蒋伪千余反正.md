    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 22nd: A unit of the Democratic Allied Army, suddenly penetrating the sparsely defended areas of western Liaoning, and cooperating with the East Mongolian Autonomous Army in the area east of the Datushan-Tongliao Railway, moved as if in an unpopulated land. From the 5th to the 8th of this month, in just four days, they successively captured key strongholds along the Zhangwu-Tongliao railway line, including Fengjia Wopu, Hou Xinqiu, Bowangfu (i.e., Left Rear Banner of Horqin), Jiergalang, and Halaqintun, capturing over 400 Chiang Kai-shek troops and killing or wounding over 40. They seized 250 rifles and pistols, and 20,000 rounds of ammunition. The Democratic Allied Army only sacrificed two soldiers and had seven wounded. During this battle, the Democratic Allied Army also persuaded 580 Chiang Kai-shek team members and over a thousand puppet troops to revolt. The Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in Kangping, Faku, Zhangwu and other cities were in a state of panic. After completing their mission, the Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from the above-mentioned areas.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: Lin Biao, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, recently sent a telegram praising a certain unit that completed the task of blocking Chiang Kai-shek's troops by marching over a hundred miles in nine hours. On the 21st of last month, after marching continuously in two locations, the unit was ordered to rush to the area south of Chengzi Street at the above-mentioned speed overnight, driving the entire 89th Regiment of the 30th Division of the New First Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who were attempting to break through, back into the street, laying the foundation for the annihilation battle of Chengzi Street.

    【新华社西满二十二日电】突然深入蒋军兵力空虚之辽西地区的民主联军一部，配合东蒙自治军在打虎山通辽铁路以东一带，如入无人之境。计自本月五日至八日的四天中即先后攻入彰武至通辽铁路线上重要据点冯家窝铺及后新秋、博王府（即科尔沁左后）、吉尔嗄朗、哈拉沁屯等地，生俘蒋记武装四百余名，毙伤其四十余名，缴获长短枪二百五十枝，子弹两万发，民主联军仅牺牲战士两人，伤七名。此次战斗中，民主联军并争取蒋记团队五百八十名及伪军千余名反正。在康平、法库、彰武等城内蒋伪军恐慌万状。民主联军于任务达成后，即主动撤离上述数地。
    【新华社东北二十二日电】东北民主联军林彪总司令顷电嘉奖以九小时行军百余里完成堵击蒋军任务的某部队。上月二十一日，该部在连续两地行军后，复奉命以上述速度连夜驰抵城子街以南地带，将企图突击之蒋军新一军三十师八十九团全部驱回街内，造成城子街歼灭战的基础。
