　　To Comrades Han Youzhen and Song Jichang of Jize: Your submissions are excellent. We hope to receive more reports from you. We would like a special introduction to the Jize Tenant Cooperative. Is the large-scale land inspection in the county still underway? Are there any typical experiences? Please report on one or two.
     To Comrade Chi Biqing of the Third Sub-district of Taihang: We understand that you are currently inspecting land reform in Xihe and Liang counties. We hope that you can write an article about the results of the inspection for publication. Submissions can be forwarded through the Taihang Branch of the New China News Agency.
     To Comrade Yang Ziping of Xingtai: The article you wrote, "Breaking Through Fifty-Odd Backward Villages in the County," was published on page two of the twenty-fifth issue as the lead story. The content was substantive and timely, and it has a promoting effect on the current movement. The Yan'an General Agency broadcasted it on the twenty-eighth. We hope you will continue to work hard to report on the continued deepening of the movement, and select a typical village for in-depth reporting.
     To Comrade Wang Minzhao of the Yubei Frontline Reporter Group: We extend our respects for your efforts in frontline reporting. We hope to strengthen communication in the future. There are many noteworthy aspects of the victory on the periphery of Hebi, the destruction of the Pinghan Railway, and the guerrilla warfare in the border areas and behind enemy lines. For example, the fact that Tang Yongliang, the commander of the 32nd Division of the Chiang army, fled in disarray in the battle on the periphery of Hebi, and the experience of Duan Fazhang's Work Team in Anyang establishing a small-scale guerrilla base, combining the anti-"reverse settlement" with guerrilla warfare, have not been reported. It would be even better if we could communicate by telephone in the future. We also hope you will inform us of the overview and experience of the reporter group for exchange.
            New China News Agency, Jinjiluyu General Branch

　　通讯往来第二号
    鸡泽韩友真、宋济昌同志：来稿甚好，望陆续报导。鸡泽租佃合作社望能作一专门介绍。该县土地大检查不知是否尚在进行？有无典型的经验？请报导一二。
     太行三分区池必卿同志：闻悉你正在昔和两县检查土地改革。希望能将检查结果写成文章发表，来稿可由新华社太行分社转。
     邢台杨子平同志：二十五日报二版登载你所写的《突破全县五十余落后村》，头条新闻，内容充实及时，对目前运动有推动作用，延安总社于二十八日播发，望继续努力报导运动继续深入情形，并选择一个典型村庄加以深刻报导。
     豫北前线记者团王敏昭同志：你们努力前线报导特致敬意，望今后多加连系，鹤壁外围胜利、平汉破击及边地、敌后游击战争值得报导之处颇多，如鹤壁外围之战蒋军三十二师师长唐永良落荒而逃，及安阳段法章武工队建立小型游击根据地，反“倒算”与游击战结合的经验等都未报导。今后如能以电话联系更好，并望将记者团概况及经验见告，以便交流。
