Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd -- The Chiang bandit troops occupying the empty city of Linyi have fallen into a situation of being surrounded on all sides by the local military and civilians. Numerous armed work teams are constantly active in the suburbs, striking against the invaders. The vast countryside more than ten li outside the city is still controlled by the People's Liberation Army, and the democratic government is carrying out various tasks as usual. After the Chiang bandit troops invaded Linyi on the 15th of last month, they once entered Dushutou and Xianggongzhuang (10 to 20 li northeast of Linyi), but were driven back in just three hours. On the 23rd, Chiang's troops conducted "encirclement and suppression" in the Chashan area (north and northeast of Linyi) on the west bank of the Yi River. The local military and civilians counterattacked, and on the 24th, they拔除the Yi stronghold eight li north of Linquyi, capturing more than 120 Chiang soldiers. On the 23rd, a unit of the PLA, in coordination with the armed work team, intercepted two battalions of Chiang's troops who were harassing the area north along the highway, killing and wounding more than 30 of them. The armed work team in the north of the city captured more than 100 "Returning Home Corps" agents in the Zhugao area (12 li northeast of Linyi). In the four days from the 20th to the 24th alone, nearly 300 Chiang soldiers and "Returning Home Corps" members were killed or captured in the periphery of Linyi.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd -- In the rectangular area on both sides of the Lin (Yi) Zao (Zhuang) highway, north of the Longhai Railway, east of the Jinpu Railway, and west of the Shu River in the Chiang bandit-occupied areas of southern Shandong, the liberated peasants of Lincheng, Pi County, Tancheng, and the near suburbs of Linyi are launching guerrilla warfare against the Chiang bandit troops' rear supply and transportation lines. According to incomplete statistics since February, a total of 114 Chiang soldiers and 285 "Returning Home Corps" members have been captured, 107 Chiang soldiers have been killed or wounded, and 225 "Returning Home Corps" members have been won over to defect. Ninety-one rifles were seized, and the Tancheng militia alone restored village democratic power in more than 100 places on the east bank of the Shu River.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd -- Among the Chiang bandit troops annihilated in the Laiwu area, it has now been verified that Xiao Chongguang, commander of the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army, was also captured.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd -- A large number of Chiang bandit officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons on the Luzhong front have been telling reporters about their experiences of being liberated. Yang Songlin, a major staff officer of the 77th Division of the 73rd Army of Chiang's troops, said: "At 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, I was captured as soon as I came into contact with your (referring to the People's Liberation Army) vanguards. The troops behind me did not have time to disperse, and you surrounded them again. You attacked our division headquarters by dawn the next day. Your troops have really strong combat effectiveness and are very well-trained!" Talking about his experience of laying down his weapons, Yang said happily: "At that time, your soldiers shouted, 'The gun belongs to Chiang Kai-shek, but your life is your own. If you lay down your gun, we guarantee your safety.' So I laid down my weapon and arrived safely at the rear." Liao Guang, a private first class in the division, said: "Who wants to fight a civil war? You were only 20 meters away from us, and the supervisors were still telling us to charge. We ignored them and surrendered our guns. More than 60 of the 90 people in the 5th company came over voluntarily." Liu Jinlong, squad leader of the 7th squad of the machine gun company of the 106th Regiment of the New 36th Division, said with a smile: "When our troops retreated, a dozen of us pretended to fall behind and came over."

　　鲁南翻身农民武装抗蒋自卫
    临沂蒋军四面被围
    蒋军师长萧重光亦于莱芜之役被俘
    【新华社华东前线三日电】侵占临沂空城之将军，已陷入当地军民四面围困中，无数武工队经常活跃城郊，打击侵犯者，离城十里以外之广大乡村仍为人民解放军所控制，民主政府照常进行各项工作。上月十五日蒋军侵入临沂后，曾一度出入独树头、相公庄（在临沂东北十至二十余里），仅三小时即被逐退。二十三日蒋军在沂河西岸茶山（临沂以北及东北）一带“清剿”，当地军民进行反击，二十四日拔除临曲沂北八里之沂据点，俘蒋军一百二十余名。二十三日解放军一部配合武工队阻击沿公路北扰之蒋军两个营，毙伤其三十余名。城北武工队于朱高（临沂东北十二里）一带生俘“还乡团”特务百余名，仅二十日至二十四日四天中，在临沂外围即毙俘蒋军及“还乡团”近三百名。
    【新华社山东三日电】鲁南蒋军侵占区临（沂）枣（庄）公路两侧、陇海路北、津浦路东、沭河西岸之长方形地带内，临城、邳县、郯城及临沂近郊等地翻身农民，正向蒋军后方补给运输线展开游击战。据二月以来不完全统计，共俘蒋军一一四名，“还乡团”二八五名，毙伤蒋军一○七名，争取“还乡团”二二五名反正，继获步枪九一支，仅郯城民兵在沭河东岸即恢复村民主政权百余处。
    【新华社华东前线三日电】莱芜地区被歼灭之蒋军中，刻又查明七十三军一九三师师长萧重光亦被俘获。
    【新华社华东前线三日电】在鲁中前线放下武器的大批蒋军官兵，纷纷对记者谈述被解放之经过。蒋军七十三军七十七师少校参谋杨松林称：“二十日下午三点钟，刚和你们（指人民解放军）尖兵一接触就被俘了，后面部队还没来得及散开，你们就又围上了，第二天拂晓你们就打到了我们师部。你们部队战斗力真强，训练真好！”谈到他放下武器的经过时，杨氏愉快地说：“当时你们战士喊话“枪是蒋介石的，命是你自己的，放下枪我们保证你安全”，于是我就放下了武器，果然安抵后方”。该师上等兵廖光说：“谁有心打内战呢，你们离我们只二十多公尺了，督战的还叫冲锋，我们不理他，缴了枪再说。五连九十多人，自动过来的就有六十多个。”新三十六师一○六团机枪连七班班长刘金龙笑着说：“当我们部队后退时，我们十几个就假装掉队过来了。”
