    Jilu Yu Frontline Art Troupe
    Summarizes Experience in Opera for Troops
    The Frontline Art Troupe of the Military Region's Forward Political Department and an art team of a certain unit recently summarized their experience in opera for troops. The troupe has continuously devoted itself to the development of opera for troops since the self-defense war, believing that this is a developmental direction for troops' theater because it absorbs the strengths of Peking opera and local operas, combining music, dance, and drama. This form has been familiar and loved by the masses for many years, and under the current conditions, theatrical performances in the front are all in squares and open fields, with audiences mainly composed of thousands of farmers turned soldiers each time. Therefore, it overcomes the shortcomings of spoken drama, which requires a lot of time to set the stage for "five hundred audience members to watch a good show."
    They have made new developments and creations in opera for troops. In the combination of music and drama, they have moved far away from the initial state of "spoken drama plus folk songs" and have developed from the folk art form of Yangge dance into opera for troops. For example, the initially performed "A Family" was entirely a Yangge opera. In the later "Two Styles of Work," many parts have gradually changed from Yangge tunes to lyrics and melodies suitable for the troop atmosphere of the characters in the play. The Yangge steps have been changed to ordinary marching steps, which are more in harmony with military camp movements. The currently created "Digging Fortifications" is entirely a magnificent and vibrant expression of the joy of the troops collectively completing tasks and the collective will and confidence in defeating the enemy. Although the "threading the flower" from Yangge is still used, it is entirely a dance version of the real action of digging fortifications by the army. The final exit steps are running in parallel columns. Percussion instruments have begun to be strongly introduced into the opera. The final scene of "Wang Keqin Platoon" begins with a strong percussion prelude. Throughout the play, military drums are used to express tension, and large gongs and small cymbals are used to express grandeur, which is coordinated with the dance.
    They absorbed a lot of experience from old dramas. For example, if the "calling the board" before the opening song is cancelled, people will feel that the singing suddenly cannot evoke emotions. In opera for troops, rhythmic dialogues or a short piece of music are used before the opening song. For example, in "The Army and the People are One Family," the old man answers his daughter-in-law with a "Yes" before singing "Open the pot of the Eighth Route Army, pour in the vegetables of the common people..." The old man says, "Comrades are all back," before singing "Wash your faces quickly..." They adopted the directing techniques of old dramas, and the scenes adopted close-up shots from movies. However, they opposed the old routines in old dramas, such as using only one or two tunes in the entire play, which cannot express the emotions of each character, and the lyrics can only use seven-character lines, which cannot express the actions and steps of each character. They changed the fast-clapper talk to be accompanied by instrumental music, carrying forward the creation of the Joint Political Propaganda Team in this area.
    In the combination of composition, music, dance, and drama, they handled more complex issues. Composers need to train the music team and the actors' singing and combine the two. The composer becomes an indispensable director, and the drama director must be familiar with music, such as instrumental music and singing, train the actors to connect with the orchestra, and enable the composer and director to cooperate in their work. The director adopted a mass line in the business process, using diagrams on the case table and beans to arrange the play in advance. The actors understand the director's intentions and the connection between their lyrics, actions, and positions. Then the actors go back to study on their own, provide the director with opinions on rehearsing the play, and often make the script, music, and director's plan more perfect.

### 冀鲁豫前线文工团  总结部队歌剧经验

    冀鲁豫前线文工团
    总结部队歌剧经验
    军区前方政治部文工团和某部文工队于日前总结部队歌剧经验：该团自自卫战争以来继续致力于部队歌剧的发展，认为这是部队剧的一个发展方向，因为它吸收了京剧和地方剧中音乐舞蹈与戏剧相结合的长处。这种形式多少年代已为群众所熟习与喜爱，而在目前条件下，前方演剧都在广场野地，每次演出都有几千农民出身的战士为主的观众，因而它又克服了“五百观众看好戏”，需要花好些时间去布景的话剧的短处。
    他们对部队歌剧已有新的发展与创造，在音乐与戏剧的结合上，已远远的脱离了“话剧加歌子”的初期状态，已经由农民艺术的秧歌形式发展成部队歌剧了。如最初演出的《一家人》完全是秧歌剧，后来的《两种作风》许多地方已经由秧歌调逐渐改成适合于剧中人物的部队气氛的歌词和曲子，由秧歌步法改成普通的行军步法，和军营动作有了进一步的谐和。现在创作的“挖工事”则定全是雄壮跳动的表现出部队集体完成任务的欢悦，和集体战胜敌人的意志和信心。虽然还采用了秧歌中的穿花，但已经完全是军队挖工事真实动作的舞蹈化。最后的退场步法则是用并列纵队的跑步。打击乐器开始被强烈地引进歌剧里来。“王克勤班”最后一场是以强烈的打击乐器为前奏的。在全剧过程中用军鼓表达紧张，用大锣和小堂锣表达雄壮，并和舞蹈配合起来。
    他们吸取了旧剧中许多经验。如起唱前的“叫板”取消了，就会使人感到唱的忽然提不起感情来。在部队歌剧里，便在起唱前使用有节奏的对话，或唱前唱一段曲子。如“军民一家”中老汉回答媳妇一个“诺”字之后，才起唱“揭开八路军的锅，倒进老百姓的菜………”。老汉说了：“同志们都回来了”，才起唱“快快洗脸………”。他们采用了旧剧导演手法，场面则采用了电影上的特写镜头。但反对了旧剧中的老一套，如全剧只用一两个曲子，不能表达出各个人物的感情，歌词能用七言，不能表达各个人物的动作与步伐。他们把快板改成用器乐曲子伴奏，发扬了联政宣传队在这方面的创造。
    在作曲、音乐、舞蹈、戏剧的结合上，他们处理了比较复杂的问题。作曲者需要训练音乐队和演员的演唱，并且把两者结合起来。作曲者成为不可缺少的导演者，戏剧导演者必须熟悉音乐，如器乐和歌唱等，训练演员能够与乐队搭上钩子，并使作曲者和导演在业务上合作。导演在业务进行上采取了群众路线，事先用图在案子上，用豆子排戏。使演员了解导演的意图，和了解自己歌词动作与位置的联系，然后演员回去自行研究，向导演提供排戏的意见，时常使剧本、曲子、与导演计划更趋完善。
