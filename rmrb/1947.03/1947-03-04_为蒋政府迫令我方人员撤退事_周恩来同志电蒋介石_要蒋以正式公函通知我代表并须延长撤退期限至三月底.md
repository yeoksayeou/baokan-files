Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: General Zhou Enlai recently sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek regarding the Chiang government's forcing the withdrawal of CCP representatives and staff in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. The original telegram is as follows: Wang Bingnan forwards to Chairman Chiang: I have just learned of the notices issued by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters and the Chongqing Garrison Command, limiting the CCP representatives and staff to withdraw by March 5th. I do not know whether this notice is the proposal of your local authorities, or from your order. If it is the former, then your Excellency should stop the arbitrary actions of the local authorities; if it is the latter, then it seems that your Excellency has decided to carry out the civil war to the end, not hesitating to finally break and close the door to all negotiations. However, in order to clarify responsibility and procedures, please still notify our representative in Nanjing, Dong Biwu, with a formal letter, and extend the withdrawal deadline to the end of March, so that our representative can make plans for the forced withdrawal accordingly, and our liaison office can also possibly complete the withdrawal. Awaiting your reply. Zhou Enlai, February 28th.

　　为蒋政府迫令我方人员撤退事
    周恩来同志电蒋介石
    要蒋以正式公函通知我代表并须延长撤退期限至三月底
    【新华社延安二日电】周恩来将军顷为蒋政府迫令撤退中共在京沪渝三地之中共代表及工作人员事致电蒋介石，原电如下：王炳南转送蒋主席：顷悉南京卫戍司令部及重庆警备司令部公布之通知，限中共代表及工作人员于三月五日前撤退，此项通知不知为贵方地方当局之主张；抑出于阁下之命令。如属前者，则地方当局之任意妄为，阁下应予以制止；如属后者，则阁下似已决心内战到底，不惜以最后破裂关死一切谈判之门。惟为判明责任与手续起见，仍请阁下以正式公函通知我方驻京代表董必武，并须延长撤退限期至三月底，俾使我方代表得据以作被迫撤退之计，而我方联络机关亦方有可能作撤退结束，专此候复。周恩来，二月二十八日。
