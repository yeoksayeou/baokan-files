Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 12th: TASS, Moscow, March 11th: The second session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held at 4:00 PM on March 11th, with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall as chairman. Shortly after the meeting began, the Foreign Ministers discussed the Soviet proposal of the 10th regarding hearing reports from participating countries of the December 1945 Moscow Conference on the implementation of the agreements reached at that time concerning the China issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin pointed out that the Moscow Conference of the previous year was not a regular session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and only representatives of the Big Three, not the Big Four, participated. Therefore, Bevin believed that it would be better to review the implementation of the conference's decisions in an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bevin did not object to exchanging views on the issue raised by the Soviet Union in an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers and expressed hope that Chinese representatives would participate. French Foreign Minister Bidault stated that France did not participate in the Moscow Conference of the previous year, and therefore could not participate in the discussion on the implementation of the decisions of that conference. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall agreed to exchange information on the implementation of the decisions in an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that the issue of preparing treaties with the five countries was discussed at the meeting of the Three Foreign Ministers in December 1945, and this issue was subsequently discussed at successive regular sessions of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. After presenting this precedent, Molotov said: "We believe that it is possible to raise this issue at a regular session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference for the purpose of requesting information. The Soviet delegation does not object to discussing this issue in the same informal manner as before, but also believes that it is feasible to discuss this issue at a regular session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Since Bevin and Marshall have both agreed to discuss this issue in an informal meeting of the Three Foreign Ministers, the Soviet delegation does not object to this proposal. At the same time, the Soviet delegation believes that the issue can be discussed informally, but an appropriate communiqué must be issued regarding the results of the discussion. If this point can be accepted by everyone, the Soviet side will be satisfied." After Molotov's statement, Bevin reiterated his original proposal and objected to the issuance of a communiqué. The meeting made no decision on this and turned to discuss other issues.

　　英美外长部分接受苏方提议
    中国问题于会外讨论
    莫洛托夫坚主检讨结果须发表公报
    【新华社延安十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：三月十一日下午四时外长会议举行第二次会议，由美国务卿马歇尔任主席。开会后不久，各外长即讨论苏方于十日所提关于听取一九四五年十二月莫斯科会议参与国对当时所达到的中国问题协议的执行情形之报告。英外相贝文提出前年莫斯科会议并非外长会议之例会，且仅为三强而非四强代表参加的会议，因此贝文认为审查该会议决定执行情形问题，以不在外长会议正式会议上审议较好。贝文并不反对在外长非正式会议上就苏方所提出的问题交换并表示希望有中国代表参加。法外长比道尔称法国未参加前年莫斯科会议，因之不能参加关于那次会议决定执行情形的讨论。美国务卿马歇尔同意在由苏英美三国外长非正式会议上交换关于决定执行情形之情报。苏外长莫洛托夫指出：一九四五年十二月三强外长会议上曾讨论准备五国和约问题，此问题后来曾在外长会议历次例会上继续讨论。莫洛托夫提出这个先例之后，就说：“我们相信为了要求情报的目的而在外长会议例会上提出这个问题是可能的，苏代表团并不反对以与前年同样的非正式方法来讨论此问题，可是也认为在外长会议例会上讨论这个问题是可行的。贝文与马歇尔既然都已同意在三强外长非正式会议上讨论此问题，苏代表团亦不反对此建议，同时苏代表团相信问题可以非正式讨论，惟需发表讨论结果的适当公报，如果这一点能为大家接受，苏方即可满意。”莫洛托夫声明后，贝文重申其原议，并反对发表公报。会议对此未作决定，即转而讨论其他问题。
