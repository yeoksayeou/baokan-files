(From our newspaper in Taiyue, 27th) In Tunliu, during the review process, cadres are encouraged to demonstrate merit and achieve further success by voluntarily distributing their excess gains to fill the gaps for the extremely poor. An investigation of 21 villages in the Second District of Tunliu revealed that in eight villages, including Xin'anzhuang and Wangjiazhuang, the gains acquired by cadres amounted to one-half of the total for the entire village; in seven villages, including Shangcun and Jishi, it reached one-third; and in six villages, including Changcun and Dongquan, it exceeded one-quarter or one-fifth. The large share of gains acquired by cadres made it difficult to close the gaps for needy households, hindering further mobilization of the masses. Initially, when this work was undertaken, village cadres felt they deserved credit for their contributions during the War of Resistance and expressed dissatisfaction and complaints, saying, "Serving the Land God at least gets you a pinch of incense ashes, but leading the masses in the turn-over gets you nothing but 'not good'!" Therefore, the leadership began by acknowledging their merits, allowing each cadre to talk about their contributions: persevering in the struggle for eight years during the War of Resistance was one merit, and leading the masses in the turn-over without complaint was another merit. Now, some of the masses have not yet achieved a turn-over. What should be done? Is this a third merit we should establish? If so, how should we establish it? Naturally, the discussion turned to their own excess gains. At this point, the leadership strengthened ideological education, prompting them to deeply reflect. Wang Xin'yi from Wangjiazhuang said, "When distributing the fruits of victory, I took one share for myself and another for my family, which was equivalent to taking one share from the masses." After a period of intense ideological struggle, several cadres bravely volunteered to distribute their excess gains to serve the people, followed by cadres in many villages setting out plans and submitting them to others for discussion before finally giving up their excess gains. As a result, the movement for Tunliu cadres to voluntarily distribute their excess gains achieved excellent results. In just two days, 67 village cadres in the Second District distributed over 290 mu of land, over 90 shi of grain, and 100,000 yuan in cash.

(From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 27th) In Bei Neizhang County, Ji County, housing is distributed according to the principle of "no house, allocate a house; little housing, supplement housing," so that everyone has a place to live. Before the distribution of houses in Bei Neizhang, middle-peasant households who could not be allocated a house were willing to sell or dismantle their houses at a price in order to get some money or bricks and wood. Middle or poor-peasant households who could be allocated a house were also willing to sell it at a price in order to pick and choose a house they liked. The leadership felt that the above opinions were not in line with the principle of filling gaps, so they inspired the groups to discuss the matter repeatedly to get through thoughts. Finally, they decided to distribute houses to those with no houses and supplement housing for those with little housing. During the distribution, the masses were asked to put forward their opinions for discussion, so that the distributed houses were not too far from their original residences, because the masses were reluctant to leave their familiar land and people, making borrowing and coming and going convenient. During the distribution, the masses all requested to live in independent courtyards and were unwilling to live in shared courtyards. After discussion, it was decided that those with large families, especially those with many children, should live in independent courtyards. Those with few people or the elderly, weak, and widowed should live in shared courtyards. The houses in the shared courtyards are good and do not need to be repaired often, and voluntary combination is done as much as possible. Who should be allocated, who should not be allocated, and how much should be allocated are based on the needs of each household. One person is allocated two or three rooms, two people are allocated three or four rooms, and children generally do not increase the number of rooms (except for those with many children). As a result of the distribution, not a single room was demolished, ensuring that poor peasants had a place to live.

    启发自觉鼓励功上加功
    屯留干部自动匀果实
    【本报太岳二十七日电】屯留在复查中，以表功再立功，动员干部匀出多得果实，填补赤贫窟窿。屯留二区廿一个村的调查，干部多得斗争果实达全村总额的二分之一者有新安庄、王家庄等八个村；达三分之一者有上村积石等七个村；达四分之一或五分之一以上者有常村东泉等六个村。由于干部多分果实，影响窟窿户填平，群众亦难进一步发动。领导上起初进行这一工作时，村干部自觉抗战有功，产生不满埋怨情绪，他们说：“侍候土地爷还能落一把香灰，领导群众翻身倒落个‘不是’！”于是领导上便从表功开始，让每个干部说说自己的功劳，抗战八年坚持斗争这是一功，领导群众翻身不辞辛苦又是一功，现在还有群众没有翻身，该怎么办呢？这第三个功劳，我们要不要立呢？如果要立，该怎么去立呢？自然便谈到自己多得果实上。领导上此时便抓紧思想教育，使其深刻反省；王家庄王新义说：“分配果实时，我自己顶一份，家里再顶一份，结果等于扣了群众一份。”经过一番剧烈的思想斗争之后，首有几个干部自告奋勇匀出多得果实，为民立功，接着许多村庄干部订出计划，并将计划交给别人去讨论，最后退出。因此屯留干部匀出多得果实的运动，便获得很好的结果。二区仅在两天之内，六十七个村干部匀出土地二百九十余亩，粮食九十余石，现款十万元。
    【本报冀南二十七日电】冀县北内漳根据没房分房、房少补房原则，作到人人有房住。北内漳分配房屋前，分不到宅子的中农户愿意把宅子作价出卖或拆掉，以便自己分些钱或砖瓦木料。能分到宅子的中农或贫中农，也愿意作价出卖，以便自己挑拣合意的宅子。领导上感觉以上意见，不合乎填补原则，便启发各小组三番五次的讨论，打通思想，最后决定没房分房、房少补房。分配时叫群众都提出自己的意见商量，作到分的房离原住处不太远，因为群众热土难离，人熟地熟，借取来往方便。在分配当中，群众都要求住独院，不愿住伙院。讨论结果，人多的，特别小孩多的，住独院。人少的或老弱孤寡住伙院。伙院房子好，不用经常修，尽可能做到自愿结合。谁应分，谁不应分，应分多少，是根据每户需要。一口人的分两间或三间，两口人分三间或四间，小孩一般的不增加间数（小孩多的例外）。分配结果，一间也没拆，作到贫苦农民都有房住。
