Introducing Several Methods of Jointly Raising Livestock

Now that our border region farmers have been emancipated and received land in the land reform, they are about to begin spring plowing. Livestock cooperation is an issue. Here are several methods from the Ji-Lu-Yu area for your reference:

	(1) "Helping the Cow's Leg": This method is most common in the central areas of Han, Fan, and Guan. A relatively wealthy household contributes most of the cow's price, feeds the cow themselves, and provides the manure. Another one or two households (generally no more than two) contribute a portion of the money and only use the cow's labor, with no other responsibilities. This method is best for combining households with less labor power with households that have more people.

	(2) All households share the cost of the cow and take turns feeding it. The problem with this method is that the cow does not easily receive consistent feed, doesn't gain weight easily, and poor households without cow sheds cannot participate. If the cow becomes thin, it is also easy to generate mutual complaints.

	(3) All households share the cow's price, and one household feeds the cow. As long as the cow is not sold, the feeder is responsible. The other cow-owning households do not provide feed or receive manure, only use the cow. This method is suitable for combining households with fewer people and the widowed and orphaned with farming households with many people and much land (roughly the same as the first method, but with unequal contributions to the cow's price).

	(4) All households share the cow's price, one household feeds it, and all households provide fodder, without sharing the manure, only using the cow. This way everyone cares about the cow, and its use is also convenient. The drawback of this method is that it is easy to quibble about the quality of the fodder. This method is suitable for combining cadres and the masses, with the masses feeding the cow and the cadres providing the fodder. It is also suitable for combining households without labor power, or those engaged in business, with households with labor power.

	(5) The method of renting a cow. Households with cows buy the cow but have no fodder to feed it, so they can plow for households without cows (the cow goes, but not the person). A certain amount of grass, grain, or money can be paid per mu ploughed.

	(6) Money is divided equally, and the family with more labor power is responsible for feeding the cow. Fodder is shared equally by everyone. Other households provide three days of manure or six days of manure in half a month, and the person responsible for feeding the cow provides ten days of manure or nine days of manure as compensation for feeding the cow.

    介绍几种伙喂牲口的办法
    现在咱们边区农民在土地改革中翻了身，得到了土地，马上要下手春耕，牲口互助是一个问题，对此，冀鲁豫已有几种办法，特介绍于下，以供各地参考：
    （１）帮牛腿，这办法在汉、范、观中心区最普遍，由一家比较富裕的户，拿出大部牛价，自己喂自己出粪，其他一家或两家（一般不能超过两家），拿出一部分钱，光使用牛力，其他不管。此法对没生产力的人家和人多的人家相结合最好。
    （２）牛价大家均摊，各户轮流喂养。这办法的毛病，牛不容易得到均匀的草料，不大上膘（肥的意思），没有牛棚的贫苦家户，不能参加，如果牛喂瘦了，也容易产生互相瞒怨的现象。
    （３）大家均摊牛价、由一家来喂养，只要这个牛不卖，喂牛的便负责，其他牛主户不出草料也不要粪，只是使用牛。这个办法适合于人少的和孤寡等与人多地多的农户相结合（与第一种大致同，不过是拿的牛价不等）。
    （４）大家均摊牛价，一户喂养，各户送草料，不分牛粪，光使牛。这样大家对牛关心，使用也都方便，这办法的毛病，容易计较出草料的好坏。这法适合于干部和群众结合，群众喂牛，干部出草料。也适合于没有劳动力的农户，或者做生意的和有劳动力的农户相结合。
    （５）租牛的办法。有牛户买起牛没有草料喂，可给没有牛的户代耕（去牛不去人）耕一亩地多少草，或粮食、钱均可。
    （６）平均摊钱，有劳动力多的家负责喂牛，草由大家均摊，半个月中其他几户出三天的粪或六天的粪，负责喂牛者出十天的粪或九天的粪，作为喂牛的报酬。
