　　Current Land Distribution
    Quantity is Roughly Equal, but Quality Still Varies Greatly
    After this movement, according to statistics from seven villages in the First and Sixth Districts, including Dongjing'an, Weilu, and Zhangjiazhuang, there are a total of 98 tenant farmer households with 260 people. Previously, each person had an average of only 0.6 mu of land, but now it has increased to 4.6 mu (because most tenant farmers are single men, one person is counted as two people for distribution); 459 poor peasant households with 1,575 people, previously had an average of 1.7 mu of land per person, but now it is 2.2 mu, and the land they received is mostly good land; the land of middle peasants has also slightly increased, from an average of 2.4 mu per person to 2.7 mu. According to the statistics of the seven villages: the average land per person is 2.5 mu, and the land quantity of poor, tenant, and middle peasants has reached a rough average. The achievement of these results is due, on the one hand, to the correct grasp of the direction of the struggle, truly achieving "finding the landlords, seeing them accurately, and hitting them hard"; on the other hand, it is due to the thorough implementation of the mass line of "mobilizing tenant and poor peasants, and uniting middle peasants." Regarding the future direction of efforts for the liberated heroes, in addition to requiring the liberated heroes to lead the masses in actively engaging in production and striving to become labor heroes, it is particularly emphasized that: to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," it is necessary to truly distribute the land fairly and reasonably. Currently, due to the landlords' attempts to conceal land in every possible way, some feudal remnants have not been completely cut off. In addition, from the perspective of the masses, although the quantity of land distributed is almost the same, the disparity in quality still exists. Therefore, it has been decided to launch a longer-term land inspection campaign in the future production movement, and the inspection should be carried out repeatedly. The liberated heroes should continue to complete this important task. Two things should be firmly grasped: one is to grasp the land problem tightly, and never stop until the distribution is completely fair and reasonable; the other is to mobilize the tenant and poor peasants, mobilizing all of them, men and women alike, without exception.

　　目前土地分配情况
    数量大体平均质量仍有悬殊
    经过这次运动，据一、六区东静庵、卫鲁、张家庄等七个村的统计，共有雇农九十八户，二百六十口人，以前每人平均只有六分地，现在合到四亩六分（因雇农多系光棍汉，一个人顶两个人分）；贫农四百五十九户，一千五百七十五口人，过去每人平均一亩七分地，现在则是二亩二分，而且分到的多系好地；中农土地也略有增加，以前每人平均二亩四，现在已增到二亩七。七村统计：平均每人合地二亩五，现贫、雇、中农土地数量已达到大体平均。这些成绩的获得，一方面是由于正确的掌握了斗争方向，真正做到了对地主“找得到、看得准、打得狠”；另一方面，是彻底实现了“发动雇贫、团结中农”的群众路线。关于翻身英雄今后努力的方向，除要求翻身英雄领导群众积极生产，争取当劳动英雄外，特别强调指出：要彻底实现耕者有其田，必须把土地真正分得公平合理。目前由于地主千方百计的隐瞒土地，有些封建尾巴，尚未完全割掉。另外，在群众方面，土地数量上虽分得差不多了，但在质量上的悬殊依然存在。因此，决定在今后的生产运动中，开展一个较长时期的土地检查工作，应三番五次、反来复去的好好检查，翻身英雄们应继续完成这一重大任务。应紧紧抓住两个东西：一个是抓紧土地问题，不到完全分配的公平合理，绝不歇手；另一个是发动雇贫，不论男女一个不剩的全部发动起来。
