Xinhua News Agency, March 17th to 23rd:

After making all the necessary arrangements, the Northwest People's Liberation Army withdrew from the empty city of Yan'an on the morning of the 19th. Hu Zongnan's army, Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs, invaded Yan'an that afternoon. Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist partners at home and abroad seemed to have discovered a new world after the 19th, after being in despair. Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs in the Chiang-occupied areas of various cities issued "extra editions" and held "celebration meetings." Chen Cheng, who had lamented his "bitter fate" in Xuzhou a month earlier, once again mustered the courage to say that "the main force of the Chinese Communists can be defeated within three months." The public opinion of the American reactionaries also believed that "the time for suppressing the rebellion can be shortened." Let these damned reactionaries rejoice. Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, and their ilk have "rejoiced" more than once. Not to mention the distant past, take the recent events as an example: when they occupied Zhangjiakou last October, they "rejoiced," but the result was a series of disastrous defeats on various battlefields; they "rejoiced" when Hao Pengju defected, saying it "changed the war situation in Lu and Su," but Hao Pengju was captured alive eleven days later; when our army withdrew from Linyi in February, they "rejoiced" again, saying that they had "defeated the organized resistance of the Shandong Communist Army," but the result was the complete annihilation of Li Xianzhou's seven divisions. Now they are clamoring and complacent about reaching Yan'an. Very well, let them "rejoice" a little longer. Li Xianzhou's fate awaits Hu Zongnan!

Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs are boasting about the "brilliant achievements" in Yan'an, saying that the Communist army has been routed. May we ask Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, can you announce the content of the so-called "brilliant achievements"? Can you tell the names of the prisoners like we can? Can you tell the serial numbers of the guns? All you have gained is an empty city, a few big mountains, and tens of thousands of empty cave dwellings. What else is there? On the contrary, we would like to ask Mr. Hu Zongnan, where is General He Qi, the commander of the 48th Brigade of your esteemed subordinates now? Can you ask him to make a statement? You cannot, he has already made a pointless sacrifice. In the Jinpen battle, we put up a slight resistance, and didn't you suffer two or three thousand casualties? Have you plucked even a single hair from the Northwest People's Liberation Army? The Northwest People's Liberation Army saw that you were only concerned with moving forward like African ostriches, just wanting to enter Yan'an, knowing that you wanted to use this to boost your own pervasive mood of failure at home, and to prop up the embarrassing Marshall internationally. You advanced lightly and rapidly, unable to consider the serious military consequences. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan will eat the bitter fruit they have sown. Even Roderick, a reporter for the Associated Press, can see this. He saw two thorough evacuations in Yan'an a long time ago, and everyone in Yan'an openly told him that the People's Liberation Army was not prepared to defend Yan'an. Looking at the entire Liberated Area battlefield, the crisis for Chiang's army is even more obvious. First of all, in the Northeast, Chiang's army is only concerned with the Changchun-Shenyang line. The East and West Manchuria Democratic Allied Army are advancing steadily. Tonghua in East Manchuria has been surrounded on all sides, and on both sides of the Datong Railway in West Manchuria, our army is as if entering an unpopulated land. In the Northeast, Chiang's army has already annihilated seven divisions. In Luxi, Yincheng, Chengwu, and Jiaxiang, they have been recovered again. More than 300 li of the Jiaoji Railway are under our control. On the Jinpu Railway, the Central News Agency has repeatedly boasted of capturing Tai'an, but Chiang's Ministry of National Defense has had to deny it. In Central China, large areas of northern Jiangsu have been restored, and the Northern Jiangsu Military Region has been established again. The vast area around Hongze Lake has been liberated again. In the Yu-Wan-Su border area, three million people have escaped the dark rule of the Chiang family dynasty. The Taiwan autonomy movement has occurred, and Chiang Kai-shek has had to withdraw troops from the front line. The 20th Division was transferred from Xuzhou, and the 21st Division was drawn from northern Jiangsu. This is Chiang Kai-shek's predicament of being stretched thin, robbing Peter to pay Paul. Chiang Kai-shek has shouldered the burden of Yan'an, and he will inevitably face greater difficulties in the future.

### 蒋介石背上了延安的大包袱  李仙洲的命运等待着胡宗南

    蒋介石背上了延安的大包袱
    李仙洲的命运等待着胡宗南
    西北人民解放军在一切都安排好了之后，十九日早晨撤出了延安这座空城，蒋介石走狗胡宗南的军队同日下午侵入了延安。蒋介石及其国内外的法西斯伙伴，从十九号以后，似乎是在绝望中又发现了什么新天地，蒋占区各城市的蒋介石走狗们又是发“号外”，又是开“庆祝会”，原来一月以前徐州自叹“命苦”的陈诚，这次又出了胆量，又一次的说是“三个月之内可以击溃中共的主力”了。美国反动派的舆论也以为“可以缩短戡乱的时间了”。让这些该死的反动派去高兴吧。蒋介石、陈诚、胡宗南之流这样的“高兴”不止一次了，远的不讲，拿最近的事情来说，去年十月侵占张家口，他们“高兴”过，结果是各个战场的惨败；郝鹏举叛变他们又“高兴”过，就是“改变了鲁苏战局”，结果十一天之后郝鹏举即被生擒；二月我军撤出临沂，他们又“高兴”过，说已“击溃山东共军有组织的抵抗”，结果是李仙洲七个师的全军覆没；现在他们又以到了延安而叫嚣而自得。很好，让他们再“高兴”些吧，李仙洲的命运正在等待胡宗南！
    蒋介石及其走狗们，正在夸耀延安的“赫赫战果”，说共军已溃不成军。请问蒋介石、胡宗南，能把所谓“赫赫战果”的内容公布么？你们能像我们一样对俘虏说得出姓名来么？枪炮说得出号码么？你们所得的是一座空城、几架大山和成千成万的空窑洞，此外还有什么呢？反过来，我们倒要请问胡宗南先生的贵部下第四十八旅旅长何奇将军现在那里去了呢？你们能请他发表谈话么？不能的，他已经是无谓的牺牲了。金盆一战，我们略加抵抗，你们不是二三千人就伤亡了么？你们拔动了西北人民解放军一根毛么？西北人民解放军看到你们已经像非洲驼鸟一样顾前不顾后，只为了想进延安，知道你们是想借此在国内为自己普遍的失败情绪打气，在国际上是想给尴尬的马歇尔撑撑门面；你们轻装急进，已经不能顾虑到严重的军事后果。蒋介石、胡宗南以后就会吃到自己种的苦果的，这种情况连美联社记者罗得利克也都看得出来，他在延安老早看到两次彻底大疏散，延安任何人都公开告诉过他，人民解放军并不准备守延安。再看整个解放区战场，蒋军的危机就更加明显了。首先是东北，蒋军只顾得长春、沈阳一线，东西满民主联军正着着前进，东满之通化已被四面包围，西满大通铁路两侧，我军如入无人之境，东北蒋军到现在已被歼灭了七个师了。在鲁西、鄞城、城武、嘉祥又被收复了。胶济路已有三百余里，被我控制了。津浦路方面，中央社曾一再吹嘘攻克泰安，而蒋记国防部又不得不否认了。在华中，苏北，大块地区已被恢复，苏北军区又成立了，洪泽湖四周广大地区又重新解放了。豫皖苏边区，已有三百万人民脱离蒋家皇朝的黑暗统治了。台湾自治运动发生，蒋介石已不得不在前线抽兵了。二十师是从徐州调走的，二十一师又是从苏北抽去的，这是蒋介石捉襟见肘，挖肉补疮的窘境。蒋介石背上了延安这个大包袱，他以后必然更加困难。（新华社三月十七日至二十三日）
