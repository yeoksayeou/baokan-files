　　[Jinan, Hebei, This Newspaper, 2nd] Cadres in the Third District of Hengshui are determined to return the struggle gains they bought cheaply. Comrade Zhang Huapu, the District Political Commissar, reflected: "My cheap purchase of the fruits of struggle is an infringement upon the interests of the masses and a form of disguised corruption. I have long felt that the distribution of fruits in the village is too chaotic, and some village cadres are buying them randomly, but I dare not directly bring it up. I am afraid that the village cadres will say: 'You are half paralyzed and want to cure someone else's madness.'" Li Wendou, director of the National Salvation Association, reflected: "Every time the masses see me wearing the two small fur coats I bought, I always feel uneasy." Comrade Wang Sanshen said: "The masses have reported that county cadres take the good things first, then the village cadres pick through them again, and when it gets to the masses, they can't find anything good." Other comrades also reflected and unanimously realized that they must resolutely return [the ill-gotten gains], and a meeting of village cadres and activists should be held to announce it, and village cadres and activists should also be educated to return the over-allocated or embezzled gains. In the past, some village cadres gave themselves things, claiming it was because they had made contributions to leading the liberation, and the masses voluntarily supported them, but in fact, most of them had ulterior motives and should also be returned.
　　[This Newspaper] In Xiazhuang, Wu'an Eighth District, the average land per person is three mu, but now that the feudal forces have been defeated, there are still forty households in the village with an average of two mu of land per person, and eight households with an average of one and a half mu of land per person. In order to thoroughly realize "filling the gap," the village's Farmers' Association director has given up five mu of land exceeding the average, the village chief has given up seven mu, the deputy village chief has given up five mu, and the cadres are determined to use various methods to ensure that poor peasants obtain land.

　　衡水三区干部经过反省
    决心带头退果实
    武安夏庄村干自动让出土地填平贫农
    【本报冀南二日电】衡水三区干部，决心退还贱买的斗争果实。区政委张化普同志反省：“我贱买果实是侵犯群众利益，是变相贪污的行为，我早感到村里果实分的太乱，有些村干乱买，但不敢直接提出来，我怕村干说：‘带着半身不遂，还给人家治疯瘫。’”救国会主任李文斗反省：“我买两个小皮袄每当群众看我时，总觉得心中不安。”王三申同志说：“群众反映过，县干先拿好的，村干再挑一遍，轮到群众就摸不到好东西。”其他同志也都做了反省，一致认清必须坚决退还，并要召开村干积极分子大会公布：并教育村干积极分子也退出多分或贪污的果实。过去有些村干赠给自己东西，名为领导翻身有功，群众自愿拥护，其实多是别有用心，也要退回。
    【本报讯】武安八区夏庄每人平均土地三亩，而现在将封建势力斗垮后，全村还有四十户每人合二亩地，八户每口合一亩半地。为求彻底实现“填平”，该村农会主任已让出超过平均数的五亩地，村长退出七亩，副村长退出五亩，干部决心用各种方法保证贫苦农民获得土地。
