    Woman Hero Han Erhua
    Cheng Guang
    On March 8th, the second day of the Anyang Heroic Killers Conference, a young woman with bullet belts slung across her shoulders and a gun in her arms sat among the heroes, freely discussing her experiences in killing the enemy with other heroes. Under a light blue military cap, her rosy face shone with bright eyes, displaying determination, quick wit, and simplicity. This is a new figure from the Taihang Mountains—Han Erhua, a woman hero who personally took up a gun to kill the enemy on the battlefield. She is from Guantai and is twenty years old. Shortly after Guantai was liberated, she actively participated in the Pinghan Campaign and became a model. After the KMT troops occupied Guantai last October, she and the militiamen began a guerrilla life with guns.
    She said that when the "Japanese devils" were around, she was still small, and her father was blind, relying on her to grow vegetables to survive. The old Baozhang (village head) would often grab her to work. At fifteen, she married a puppet soldier who hung boxes (a type of official), and her mother-in-law was like a she-wolf, not allowing her to eat, forcing her to work day and night without sleep, and beatings were commonplace. “At that time,” she said, “all the power was theirs, and suffering was mine.” Once, because she didn't pour out the water used to wash the pot, her mother-in-law forced her to drink it. Unable to swallow it, she fainted from anger. At night, she wanted to kill herself and tightened a belt around her neck for a long time. A big lump rose on her neck, and then it snapped open. She thought, “I still want to live!” So, she sneaked back to her mother's house at night. Her husband came with a gun to抓 catch her, saying he would kill her. She was scared out of her wits and crawled everywhere. Her father, blind, couldn't see, and Erhua cried, "Dad, save me!" Her father rolled over to protect his daughter. The man couldn't drag the father and daughter, who were clinging tightly together, so he tore off a tuft of her hair and left.
    In August, the Eighth Route Army arrived. Erhua heard: When the Eighth Route Army comes, anyone with grievances can speak out. When the peasant association was organized, she was the first to sign up. As soon as the liquidation movement started, she was elected as a liquidation committee member, leading everyone to first settle accounts with the old Baozhang, and then the whole village rose up to crush the Song family's feudal group, also seizing the special agent's gun. Her special agent mother-in-law didn't give up and went to Zhangde to get poison, but Erhua and the villagers severely punished her again. At the meeting, the villagers unanimously approved Erhua's request for divorce. From then on, the masses were liberated, and Erhua was also liberated, becoming one of the leaders of the Guantai masses. She always took the lead in everything. When the village organized the militia, she also participated, saying, “Learning some martial arts can be used at any time. Don't be afraid of hidden guns, and can protect my own liberation.” She first practiced throwing stones, and then practiced throwing grenades. The first time she saw the grenade she threw explode, she jumped up with joy. During the expansion of the army, she patiently helped everyone understand the importance of joining the army, and many people signed up. She also wanted to go, but everyone said she was better off working in the rear and stopped her. But she always wanted to personally fire a few shots at those KMT bandits who came to夺 seize her rice bowl and freedom. So, she actively practiced martial arts in the village, saying, "The enemy has guns, and we also have guns and bombs. If anyone dares to bully me again, I will accurately give them two!"
    Last October, when the KMT troops occupied Guantai, she painfully left her blind father and her vegetable garden, but she didn't shed a tear. She went up the mountain to fight as a guerrilla. She was selected as an Anyang emancipated hero to attend the Taihang Heroes Conference. At the conference, she saw many heroes who had killed the enemy, especially after hearing stories of courageous enemy killing, she was extremely envious. When she returned, she said to Political Commissar Li, "I want to go to the front. My place of struggle is in Guantai."
    When she arrived at the front, everyone had her do reconnaissance and political reform work. She used her intelligence to come up with many methods. In Guantai, she tore down enemy slogans and put up ours. She completed the mission skillfully, three times in and three times out. The first time she went to gather information, one morning, she put a net on her head and carried a basket of radishes, swaggering in. That night, many villagers secretly ran to ask about her. An old man said, "Child, people said you were killed, how did you come back?" Erhua said, "I didn't die, I am there to fight the enemy." Everyone told her their sufferings and shared many situations, and Erhua also told everyone about the Eighth Route Army's methods and news of victory. When they parted, the old lady also said, "Don't forget us women, tell the Eighth Route Army comrades to fight back sooner!" That night, Erhua took a small boat and crossed the river back.
    The second time was on the third day of the Lunar New Year to deliver New Year's gifts. Guantai was plunged into darkness. She brought New Year's gifts—money and rice—so that those who had been exploited by the landlords could get some yellow steamed buns to eat. She hid propaganda materials and special warning letters for the landlords in her waist. After entering, the farmers who had been emancipated were moved to tears when they saw her. An old woman hugged the New Year's gifts and knelt down facing west, bowing. She muttered, "Chairman Mao in the West is above, I, this poor person, will never forget your kindness for generations." She quickly stuffed the letters and propaganda materials into the door seams of each house. The next day, the bullies picked up the letters warning them from the courtyard and dared not do much.
    On the 19th of last month, the day before the militia cooperated with the battalion to attack Guantai, Erhua went in again to reconnoiter the local defense corps and enemy fortifications, reporting back what she saw. She busily took out her only one thousand yuan, giving it to the political commissar, saying, "If I am killed, use this for the wounded comrades!" After speaking, she picked up her gun and ran after the troops. When the battle began, she climbed on the mountain. As soon as she fired a shot, our people rushed in. Then the wounded were carried down. In the middle of the night, without anyone calling her, she was called down again to make soup to comfort the wounded comrades. When the militia抓 captured the local defense corps, enemy bullets were densely fired at us. She and everyone quickly loaded the wounded one by one onto the boat, and then picked up her gun to fight with the withdrawing militia. After returning, she excitedly said, "The sound of my gun is really crisp and beautiful!"
    On the last day of the conference, when the masses and refugees who had escaped went to the conference to present gifts, she jumped onto the stage and said to the heroes, "In order to defend Chairman Mao, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and save our own people, let us kill a few more enemies and fight back sooner!"

    女英雄韩二花
    程光
    三月八号，安阳杀敌英雄大会第二天，一个肩上斜披子弹带、怀中抱着枪的青年妇女，坐在英雄群里，谈吐自如的和其他英雄们谈着杀敌经验。浅蓝色军帽下红红的脸上，闪着一双明亮的眼睛，显示出刚毅、机敏、朴实。这是太行山上一个新的人物——亲手拿枪在战场上杀敌的女英雄韩二花。她是观台人，现年二十岁，观台解放不久，平汉战役时，她便积极参战，并成为模范。去年十月蒋军占观台后，她和民兵一起拿着枪杆开始游击队生活。
    她说日鬼在时她还小，父亲是个瞎子，靠她种菜园生活。老保长还不时抓她去作工，十五上，嫁了个挂盒子的伪军，婆子像只母狼，不让吃，日夜劳动不能睡，挨打是家常便饭。“那时”她说：“厉害都是人家的，熬煎受苦是我的”。一次因未倒刷锅水，婆子便逼她喝下去，实在咽不下，气晕了，夜晚想自杀，用裤带勒了半晌，脖上起个大圪塔，一骨辘又开了，又想：“我还要活”！于是，趁夜偷跑回娘家去。汉子带着枪来抓她，说要打死她，她吓破了胆到处钻，爹瞎着眼看不见，二花哭叫着：“爹，快救我！”父亲滚过来打救自己的女儿，那人拖不动这死抱在一起的父女俩，揪了她一撮头发走了。
    八月里，八路军到了，二花听说：八路军来，谁有冤苦谁就诉。组织农会时，她便第一个报名参加，清算运动一搞开，就被选成清算委员，领导着大家首先向老保长算账，接着全村人起来打垮了宋家封建集团，把特务的枪也夺了过来。她特务婆子不死心，又到彰德取毒药来下毒，又被二花和村上人狠狠的将她惩倒了。大会上全村人举手赞同了二花离婚的要求，从此群众翻了身，二花也翻了身，并成为观台群众领袖之一。她干工作样样在前面，村上搞民兵，她也参加，说：“学下武艺，随时可用，不怕黑枪，可以保自己翻身。”她先练扔石头，后来就实习投弹，当第一次看到她投出的手榴弹开了花时，她高兴的蹦起来了。扩军时，她耐心给大家打通思想，不少人报名参军，她也要去，大家说她不如在后方工作，拦住了她。可是她总想亲自照准那来夺自己的饭碗和自由的蒋军强盗开两枪，于是，在村里积极练武，她说：“敌人有枪，我们也有枪，有炸弹，谁再来欺侮我，就准准当当的给他吃两颗！”
    去年十月间，蒋军占了观台，她忍痛离开没了眼的亲爹和她的菜园，但她没有流一点眼泪，上山打起游击来。她被选为安阳翻身英雄出席了太行群英会。在会上，看到了许多杀敌英雄，特别是听到英勇杀敌的故事，她羡慕极了，回来，就向李政委讲：“我要到前方去，我的斗争地方在观台。”
    到了前面，大家让她作侦察和政改工作，她运用自己的聪明想出许多办法，在观台将敌人标语撕掉，贴上我们的，三进三出都巧妙的完成了任务，头一次是去搞情况，一个早上，她把剪发头上上网子，提着一篮萝卜，过了河大模大样的进去了。当晚，许多老乡都暗中跑去探问，一个老汉说：“孩，人家说把你打死了，你怎么回来的？”二花说：“没有死，我是在那打敌人的”。大家诉了阵苦，谈了许多情况，二花也把八路军的办法和胜利消息告给大家。分手时，老大娘还说：“可不要忘了咱娘们啊，告八路军同志早些打回来吧！”当晚二花便坐着小船过河回来了。
    第二次是正月初三送年礼，观台沉没在黑暗中，她带着年礼——钱和米，去让那被地主倒算了鸡吃的人们，能弄点黄蒸吃。她腰里藏着宣传品及专门给地主的警告信，进去后，曾翻过身的农民，一见她感动的就流下泪来。一个老太太搂住年礼便朝西跪下，作着揖。顺嘴念着：“西天毛主席在上，我这难人，世世代代永也忘不了你的恩情。”很快将信、宣传品塞向各个人家的门缝里。第二天，恶霸们从院中拾起了警告他的信，便不敢多活动了。
    上月十九号，当民兵配合营兵打观台的前一天，二花又进去把还乡团和敌人工事地方都侦察清楚，回来报告后，就忙将自己身上仅有的一千元钱，掏出交给政委，她说：“我要被打死了，这给受伤的同志用了吧！”说罢便提起枪跟着队伍跑去了。战斗开始时，她爬在山上，刚放出了一枪，我们的人已冲进去了，接着有彩号抬下来，半夜里没人招呼，她又被叫下来，弄汤水安慰受伤同志。当民兵将还乡团等抓出来，敌人的子弹密集的向我们射击，她和大家很快将彩号一个个架上船，随后便端起枪配合着撤出的民兵打起来。回来后她兴奋的讲着：“我这枪笑起来，叫的真是脆的好听啊！”
    大会结束那天，群众和逃出来的难民去向大会送礼时，她跳上台向英雄们讲：“我们为了保卫毛主席，打败蒋介石，救出自己人，让我们多杀几个敌人，早日打回去吧！”
