    【This dispatch from our Taihang office on the 25th】 Since the start of the merit-earning campaign in Taigu earlier this month, the county's militia has been actively defending the emancipation of peasants in the border areas. In the past half-month, the militia annihilated two squads including the "Revenge Team" ringleader Lü Bazhe, extensively deploying landmine warfare. The militia in the fifth and seventh districts has been awarded major merits. Sha Chunhua, a villager from S卦 village and a hero in killing the enemy, after hearing the village announce her merit on the first of this month, initiated a competition with other militiamen. First, on the second of this month, she led the villagers to repel over a hundred invading enemies, capturing one person and one gun, and immediately reported her merit to the district that night. After studying the enemy's movements, the seventh district militia deployed minefields in villages such as Donglu and Bainen on the third night. The next day, the enemy indeed arrived and immediately fell into our minefield, where seven members of the "Revenge Team," including ringleader Tai Bazhe, were killed, and one was injured. The county headquarters issued a commendation, recorded a major merit, and awarded 200 yuan. On the ninth of this month, while villagers from Yanji and Er villages in the fifth district were holding a meeting for emancipation, the stubborn Yan bandits from the 13th Security Regiment stationed in Ren village, in coordination with a portion of the enemy from Shangzhuang, totaling 200 men, suddenly attacked the village. At that moment, the Taihang first-class enemy-killing hero, Jia Mao Hou, led the villagers including those from Yan and Fan, waited for the enemy to approach the village, and met them head-on with hand grenades. They bravely repelled three enemy assaults in a row, killing seven enemy soldiers including a squad leader, causing the enemy to flee in panic. The county headquarters immediately awarded the village militia three merits.
    【This dispatch from our Taihang office on the 25th】The militia in the fifth district of Taigu, in coordination with the political offensive, has launched a guerrilla war with remarkable results. According to statistics from February 5th to March 13th, within 40 days, they annihilated one enemy company, killed four enemy soldiers including two company commanders, wounded 24, and won over more than ten to surrender.
