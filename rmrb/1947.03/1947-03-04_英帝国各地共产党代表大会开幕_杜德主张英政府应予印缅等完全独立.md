Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: A comprehensive dispatch from London: Following the closing of the British Communist Party Congress, the Communist Representatives' Conference of various regions of the British Empire immediately opened in London. At the meeting on the 26th, attendees listened to a report from Dudd, chairman of the conference's International Affairs Committee. The report demanded complete independence for India, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, and Palestine. Dudd said: "The Communist Party, in supporting the recently announced Indian plan, is exploiting one side against the other to implement Britain's divide-and-rule policy, as a basis for continuing British rule in 1948." Dudd also denounced the British Governor's inspection of South Africa as actually being an attempt by the Smuts regime, stained with the blood of cruel exploitation through national oppression. The Indian Communist Party representative, A. K. Bhyanli, told the conference on the 27th: "As long as Britain maintains its imperialist policy in India and other colonies, it will never be able to save its own crisis." Further dispatch: After the general meeting on the 25th, the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party sent a congratulatory telegram, which requested that the Indonesian issue be included on the conference agenda and supported the Indonesian people's struggle for freedom.
