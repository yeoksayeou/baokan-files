    Steadfast Stance
    Liu Qixiang Unbribable by Landlord
    [Our Newspaper's report] Wang Shude, a landlord in Si Nu Shu Village, Fourth District, Shen County, bribed Wang Qingchun, the village's Farmers' Association Director, to continue his feudal rule. In order to escape struggle, he gave 40,000 yuan to Wang Qingchun to give to Liu Qixiang, a low-level cadre in the district (Liu was originally an old relative of Wang Shude, but a few years ago, Wang Shude broke off relations with Liu's family because they were poor). Wang Qingchun said to Liu Qixiang, "Your Brother Shude sees that you have had a hard time this year and asked me to bring you tens of thousands of yuan." Upon hearing this, Liu Qixiang scolded, "Stop talking nonsense! Why didn't he see me those few years?" He also said to Wang Qingchun, "You are still the chairman of the Farmers' Association, doing something that is so unfair to the masses!" Wang Qingchun returned in shame. Recently, Liu Qixiang personally went to the village to lead the masses in overthrowing Wang Shude.

    立场坚定
    刘其祥不受地主收买
    【本报讯】莘县四区四女树村地主王书德，收买了本村农会主任王青春，继续其封建统治，为了逃避斗争，以四万元叫王青春送给小区干部刘其祥（刘原是王书德的老亲，前几年因刘家穷，王书德就和刘家断了亲），王青春对刘其祥说：“你书德哥看你这一年太作难，叫我给你送来几万块钱。”刘其祥一听大骂：“你别放屁啦，那几年他怎么看不着我？”又向王青春说：“你还是农会长，办这样对不起群众的事！”王青春惭愧的回去了。最近刘其祥又亲到该村领导群众斗垮王书德。
