　　Licheng is distributing the fruits of victory, taking care of women's interests, and conducting ideological education. Women's consciousness has been raised, and the enthusiasm for organizing production and practicing martial arts is unprecedentedly high. At the beginning of filling the gaps, the distribution was based on households according to needs, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of women had no status in the family. The fruits of victory distributed by household generally did not reach women. As Li Aixiang, chairman of the Houjun Women's Rescue Association, said: "Participating in a winter of the movement is not as good as participating in weaving! Weaving a winter's cloth can make us a new dress, and some fruits of victory were distributed, my old man gave them all to his daughter! We don't even have a needle or thread!" After the leadership discovered this problem, they asked the masses to discuss it in the turn-over team and re-decided on the distribution method: housing, land, livestock, etc. were filled by household according to needs. Clothing, jewelry, farm tools, etc. were supplemented by household according to individual needs. During the specific distribution, households were scored and items were priced, so that everyone had no objections to the distribution. Zhang Shuqi, a middle peasant in Langpo, had eight people in his family, including two daughters-in-law. The whole family was divided into 23,000 yuan of Jicha and 15 sheep. The family gave each of the two daughters-in-law 4,000 yuan. Zhang Shuqi's daughter-in-law was given three sheep, and his brother's daughter-in-law was an activist in the movement, and the family gave her five sheep. Lu Weide, a militiaman in Lubao, was given a set of grass-green military uniform, and his woman was given a red cotton-padded jacket. Both were very satisfied. After Changning distributed the fruits of victory, it immediately raised the issue of how to defend the fruits of victory and let everyone discuss it, further raising the consciousness of the masses. Among the 121 people who requested to join the militia to support the patriotic war, more than 50 were women. At the same time, the leadership proposed that "fruits of victory are stagnant water, production is living water, and walking and eating is better than sitting and eating." After enlightening everyone to produce and unblocking their thinking, Changning women formulated a 100-day weaving plan, added 40 hand-pulled shuttles, opened three weaving training classes, and studied how to improve weaving technology. They also organized a village cooperative and seven small cooperatives, and have now raised 1.2 million yuan in shares.

　　黎城分配果实中
    照顾妇女利益
    衣服首饰按人需要以户补
    【本报黎城讯】黎城分果实中照顾妇女利益，结合进行思想教育，妇女觉悟提高，要求组织生产练武的情绪空前高涨。开始填窟窿时，以户为单位按需要分配，忽略了广大妇女们在家庭内没地位，按户分回的果实，一般妇女得不到。如后峻妇救会主席李爱香说：“参加了一冬运动，还不如参加纺织哩！织一冬布咱能做件新衣衫，分了些果实，俺老翁都给了他闺女啦！咱连一针一线也没有！”领导上发现了这个问题后，让群众在翻身小组讨论，重新决定分配办法：房地牲口等按户需要以户填。衣服首饰农具等，按人需要以户补，具体分配时以户评分，以物作价，这样分配大家都没有意见。榔坡中农张书奇家八口人，有两个媳妇，全家分了两万三千元冀钞，十五只羊。家里给两个媳妇每人分了四千元、书奇媳妇分了三只羊，他兄弟媳妇是运动中的积极分子，家里给她分了五只羊。路堡民兵路维德，分了一身草绿色军装，他女人分了件红棉袄，两个人都很满意。长宁分果实后，立即提出如何保卫果实让大家讨论，进一步提高群众觉悟。要求参加民兵支援爱国战争的一百二十一人中，即有五十多个妇女参加。领导上，同时提出“果实是死水，生产是活水，走吃比坐吃强。”启发大家生产，打通思想后，长宁妇女订出百日纺织计划，增加了四十架手拉梭，开了三个纺织训练班，研究提高纺织技术。并组织一个村合作社，七个小型合作社，现已集起股金一百二十万元。
