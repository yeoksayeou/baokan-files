　　Our Newspaper Printing Plant Workers
    Launch Production Emulation Drive to Increase Production and Contribute Labor to Support the Front Lines

    [This Newspaper News] In order to support the front lines with practical actions and greet the counter-offensive, our newspaper printing plant has formulated a plant-wide production emulation competition plan:

    First, increase production by 1.56 million characters this month (based on 17 people, the average monthly output in the past was 1.15 million characters), and support the front lines with 7,300 catties of rice throughout the year.

    Second, strengthen technical learning, improve the quality of newspapers, and achieve: beautiful layout, clear titles, reduce typos, eliminate high and low characters and bad characters, use "four-square" characters, adjust "two-square" special Song typeface, reuse "header" characters, and create carved wooden mold characters. The number of corrections after proofreading should not exceed 12 characters per month (one error per 90,000 characters), and the titles are guaranteed to be error-free. The lead plates should be deep, uniform, and whole. At least three paper plates should be poured from one original, and the number of melted plates should not exceed once per month. The signed proofs should be sent out between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM (except in special circumstances), two sets of lead plates should be produced within two hours, and sent to the machine department within 20 minutes. Typesetting department: Skilled in typesetting and returning characters, returning a case of characters in 40 minutes, and keeping the frame tidy. Apprentices should typeset an average of 800 characters per hour, with no more than 18 errors per thousand characters. Workers should typeset an average of 1,000 characters per hour, with no more than 13 errors per thousand characters, gradually reducing and eliminating omissions of sentences and lines. Shorten the page layout time. Train at least one new page layout worker in three months, and two new trainees who can return characters and typeset (typesetting and returning more than 2,000 characters each per day). Proofreading Section: Skilled in proofreading techniques, ensuring publication time, and ensuring that no more than six typos per two pages of the newspaper. Plate Making Department: Bake the plates dry without scorching, apply the paste evenly, and ensure that three plates are poured without sticking. For engraving time, workers should complete the task in 40 minutes, and apprentices should complete it within one hour, with a regular layout. Train a skilled baking and pouring apprentice within three months. Character Engraving Department: All apprentices should learn how to sharpen knives, cultivate two people who can engrave regular script, one person who can engrave small No. 5 characters with more than 25 strokes, and two people who can engrave Song and bold typefaces.

    Third, practice strict economy: implement a profit-sharing system for saving supplies, establish equipment to prevent lead consumption, regularly organize messy materials, and promote the use of waste materials and substitutes.

    Fourth, maintain cleanliness and hygiene, reduce sick personnel, and ensure full staffing during the campaign.

    Fifth, worker education: insist on attending political classes and reporting current events, regularly publish worker wall newspapers, and organize small reading groups. Comrades with lower levels of education should learn two to five new characters per day. Eliminate the phenomenon of uneasiness at work, and strictly enforce organizational and labor discipline.

    Sixth, strengthen the close relationship between the Party, the government, and the labor union.

    Seventh, fully launch the production and economy emulation campaign, establish a merit committee, record and commend merits at any time, and reward merits regularly to promote new heroism.

    [Another News] In the production and economy emulation campaign, all employees of our newspaper printing plant have an unprecedentedly high enthusiasm and are working hard and actively to be the first. The Character Engraving Department organized amateur character engraving and earned 15,500 yuan in half a month. The cook ground 95 catties of tofu, earning 1,400 yuan, and sprouted 15 catties of bean sprouts, which also fed four piglets. The typesetting department is working very hard. In addition to completing the task of publishing newspapers, they also add one hour of voluntary work per person per day. According to the statistics from March 1st to 10th, a total of 113,000 characters have been typeset. The comrades in the Proofreading Section actively saved salary and worked hard to spin flowers. The female comrades have sprouted two pots of bean sprouts. The Plate Making Department uses waste paper to make plates, which can save half of the good paper per plate. At the same time, coal tar is used instead of charcoal to melt lead and bake plates, which greatly saves materials. Comrade Cao Youlin, who has always been an active figure in production, has now contributed 15,900 characters, and the wages are completely turned over to the public, in order to complete the annual task of turning in 20,000 yuan in advance. The whole factory is filled with an atmosphere of intense production.
