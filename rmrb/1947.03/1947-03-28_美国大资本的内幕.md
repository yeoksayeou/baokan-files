Is Industry More Concentrated Since the War?

After this war, commercial competition in the United States will be conducted more fiercely among a few large enterprises, rather than among many small businesses. In some respects, actual monopolies will exist. Anyone discussing the future of private enterprise must consider this point, otherwise they will overlook the most important characteristic of the American economy.

Large corporations, with their huge liquid assets, have purchased government equipment and many small businesses. Since 1943, the rate of mergers and acquisitions among enterprises has been higher than in the previous fifteen years, and the rate of increase is linear.

How Do Large Factories Expand?

In 1939, the 250 largest manufacturing companies in the United States owned 65% of the nation's production equipment. During the war, they owned 79% of the new equipment created with federal and private funds. They had priority in purchasing all the equipment they needed to operate.

During the war, the United States spent 260 billion yuan on new production equipment – factories and machines. In 1939, the total production equipment was worth only 400 billion yuan. The new wartime equipment was the most modern and highly efficient.

Wartime technological improvements and inventions could help create new products and reduce production costs; these new developments were mainly created by large enterprises. Although much scientific research was funded by the government, the experiments were conducted in the research laboratories of large enterprises. From their wartime profits, large enterprises also extracted hundreds of millions of yuan to advertise their companies and trademarks. After the war, the 63 largest manufacturing companies in the United States had liquid assets that were even greater than the funds of the entire national production organization in 1939 (approximately 100 billion yuan).

Between June 1940 and October 1, 1944, the US government signed a total of 1,750 billion yuan worth of production contracts. Approximately two-thirds of the major contracts were obtained by 100 large manufacturers. It is estimated that half of these were accepted by 33 companies, each receiving orders worth more than 100 billion yuan, and the largest ten companies received 30% of the government bonuses.

The largest enterprise company was General Motors, controlled by DuPont, which signed manufacturing contracts with the government worth 138.12 billion yuan.

The Decline of Small Businesses

Did large enterprises share these wartime production contracts with small businesses, subcontracting a small portion of the contracts to them? Only one-third of the major contracts were transferred from large enterprises to other companies, and 75% of these transfers went to other large companies. These large companies then transferred to others. Small factories' wartime production accounted for only 30% of total production.

In manufacturing in 1939, 98.9% of the business organizations employed fewer than 500 people. The number of people they employed accounted for 51.7% of the national workforce. In 1944, although factories with fewer than 500 employees still accounted for 97.8%, the total number of workers they employed had decreased to 38.1%.

Monopoly Before and After World War I

Corporate mergers and the control of prices and output began gradually after the American Civil War. By 1904, so-called trusts controlled nearly 40% of the nation's production capital. At that time, the United States had thirty monopolies, including asphalt, whiskey, electrical equipment, leather, petroleum products, glass, machine-made shoes, steel, sugar, and tobacco, etc. According to Means's estimates, in 1909, approximately 200 of the largest companies (excluding banks and insurance companies) owned one-third of the nation's assets.

During World War I, large enterprises developed and grew very rapidly. The 200 non-financial business organizations that controlled one-third of the nation's business assets in 1909 owned 48% of the nation's business assets by 1929. Their total income increased from 33% of the nation's income in 1920 to 43% in 1929. The 5% of large companies earned 78.9% of the nation's company income in 1918 and continued to increase their share, reaching 8.9% by 1932. Those manufacturing companies that could obtain a net profit of more than 5 million yuan annually accounted for 34.2% of the total income of manufacturing companies in the United States in 1918 and increased to 46.1% by 1929. As for those companies with annual net profits of less than 250,000 yuan, they gradually lost their position. They accounted for 23.4% of total production in 1918, but this had dropped to 19.1% by 1929.

The Roosevelt Era

During the depression, even enterprises were hit, and large enterprises suffered even greater losses. However, during the recovery phase, the trends in enterprises reoccurred. In 1926, the 316 largest manufacturers owned 35% of the nation's liquid assets, and this increased to 47% by 1938. In 1934, manufacturing companies with capital of 500,000 only accounted for 37% of the nation's production capital, but by 1942, they owned 49% of the assets. Later, the number of large enterprises decreased to 205. In 1942, large manufacturing companies with annual income of more than 5 million owned half of the nation's production capital, while in 1929, their rate accounted for only 46%. In other words, companies with income of less than 250,000 yuan still had 19.1% of the nation's production capital in 1929, but this had decreased to 1.6% by 1942.

The growth of large enterprises during the Roosevelt era was mainly not due to mergers between individual companies, but due to mergers between large entrepreneurs. This merger situation was particularly evident between 1919 and 1929, especially in the steel industry, machinery manufacturing, tableware manufacturing, film industry, and hotel industry. Of course, the concentration of control of electric power plants is also well-known.

The number of merged units in 1929 was three times more than in 1919. During the depression and the New Deal's recovery phase, the number of industrial and commercial mergers suddenly decreased. The trend in industry changed to the expansion and growth of existing large enterprises.

Who Are the Tycoons?

The propaganda of large companies says that stocks are distributed to millions of shareholders, so the management of large enterprises is democratized. But in fact, according to research by the "Securities and Exchange Commission": before the war, approximately 18,000 people (8 out of 100,000 of the total population) owned a quarter of the nation's stocks, and 75,000 people (6 out of 10,000 people) owned half of the nation's stocks. The 1,000 largest dividend earners received 10.4% of the nation's various dividends, and 61,000 people received half of all the nation's dividends.

In the 200 largest non-financial business organizations, 60% of the stocks were owned by the top 1% of the major shareholders. Among these 200 companies, a quarter of the companies' stocks were owned by the 20 major shareholders. In addition, approximately 40 large business organizations also had 20 major shareholders who owned 25% to 50% of the total stock amount – which is enough stock to control the company. In addition, three tycoons – DuPont, Mellon, and Rockefeller – controlled 15 of these 200 largest enterprises, with total assets of approximately 800 billion yuan. In addition to the above situation, many tycoons also indirectly control more large business organizations through trusts, interlocking directorates, investment trusts, and bank subsidiaries. In 1935, the 200 largest companies and the 50 largest financial organizations were controlled by 400 tycoons. If the above research is correct, we can imagine the concentration situation in 1945 to 1955.

There were many small businesses initially founded, but many failed, and only a few succeeded. Even fewer small businesses had the opportunity to gradually grow. The business crises expressed by bankruptcy figures and low profits refer to small industrial and commercial businesses; "business crisis" is actually propaganda sung by large entrepreneurs for their own benefit.

    美国大资本的内幕

    本文原载去年九月二日出版的美国《新共和》周刊，原题是Facts AboutBig Busiess ，这里是从《世界知识》转载，因篇幅关系，经编者略加删节。其中说明战争以来美国资本的集中，大资本家大企业的控制一切，这是资本主义登峰造极的表现，说明了今日美国政策愈趋反动的背景，可供读者研究时事的参考。
    ——编者                
    战争以来工业更集中吗？
    在这次战争以后，美国商业竞争将更猛烈的在少数大企业之间进行，而不是在多数小企业之间进行。在若干方面，实际的独占会存在。讨论私人企业前途的人，如果不将这一点考虑在内，就会忽略了美国经济中最重要的一个特色。
    大公司曾经以它们巨大的流动资金，购买政府的设备和许多小企业。从一九四三年起，企业间合并和占有的比率，比之以前的十五年就更高了，而且增加的速度是直线形的。
    大工厂怎样扩展？
    一九三九年，美国有二百五十个最大的制造公司，拥有全国生产设备中的百分之六十五。到了战时，它们拥有了联邦资金和私人经费所造成新设备中的百分之七十九。他们有优先权购置一切它们经营所需的设备。
    在战时，美国曾经花费二百六十万万元于新的生产设备——工厂和机器。而一九三九年全部的生产设备不过共值四百万万元。战时新式的设备都是最现代化的，而且效率极高。
    战时的技术改良和发明，可以帮助造成新的产品，同时减低生产的成本；这些新的发展主要是大企业所造成的。许多科学研究虽然是由政府资助，但是试验都是在各大企业的研究室中进行的。而大企业在它们所获得的战时利润中，又取出了数百万元替它们的公司和商标做广告。在战争结束以后，全美有六十三个最大的制造公司，它们的流动资金比较一九三九年全国生产机构的资金（约当一百万万元）还要巨大。
    在一九四○年六月到一九四四年十月一日之间，美国政府一共签订了价值一千七百五十万万元的生产合同。其中约有三分之二的重要合同，都是由一百家大制造商取得的。据估计，其中有一半是由三十三个公司所接受的，它们每家都获得了十万万元以上的定货单，而最大的十家公司，并且还得到了百分之三十的政府奖金。
    最大的一家企业公司是杜邦控制下的通用汽车公司，它和政府签订了一百三十八万万一千二百元的制造合同。
    小企业的没落
    大企业不是和小企业分享这些战时生产合同，把合同中的一小部分交给小企业呢？只有三分之一的主要合同，是由大企业转给其他公司的，而在这转移之中，又有百分之七十五转到了其他大公司。这些大公司再转给他人。小工厂的战时生产量，只当全部生产的百分之三十而已。
    在制造业中，一九三九年有百分之九八·九的企业组织，雇用人员都在五百人以下。它们所雇用的人数，一共占着全国职工的百分之五一·七。而在一九四四年，职工人数在五百人以下的工厂，虽还占着百分之九七·八，但是其雇用工人的总数，则减低到百分之三八·一。
    第一次大战前后的独占情形
    企业的合并以及物价和产量的控制，在美国南北战争以后就渐渐开始了。一九○四年，所谓托辣斯，差不多控制全美生产资金，百分之四十。其时美国有三十种独占事业，包括沥青，威士忌酒，电气设备，皮革，石油产品，玻璃，机器制鞋业，钢铁，糖类和烟草等等。据弥恩氏估计，一九○九年中，约有二百家最大的公司（银行和保险公司除外）拥有全美资产的三分之一。
    在第一次世界大战中，大企业发展成长得非常迅速，在一九○九年控制了全美三分之一企业资产的二百家非金融企业组织，到一九二九年已经拥有百分之四十八的全美企业资产。它们全部的收入，从一九二○年占全美收入的三十三，增加到一九二九年的百分之四十三。百分之五的大公司，在一九一八年赚得了全美公司收入的百分之七八·九，后来继续增加股分，到一九三二年已占百分之八·九。那些制造公司，每年可以获得纯利五百万元以上，在一九一八年时，他们占有全美制造公司总收入的百分之三四·二，到一九二九年已增加到占百分之四六·一。至于那些每年获得纯利在二十五万元以下的公司，则渐渐失去了地位，它们在一九一八年占总生产中的百分之二三·四，到一九二九年已降低到占百分之一九·一了。
    罗斯福时代
    在不景气阶段中，还有的企业都受到了打击，而大企业受到的损失也更大。然而在复兴阶段中企业中的趋势又重行发生。一九二六年，有三百十六个最大的制造家拥有全美流动资金的百分之三十五，到一九三八年增加到了百分之四十七。一九三四年，每家有五十万资本的制造业只占全美生产资本的百分之三十七，但到一九四二年，它们拥有的资产就提高到百分之四十九了。后来，大企业的数目减到二百零五家。一九四二年，制造业的大公司中，每年收入在五百万以上的，拥有全美生产资本的一半，而在一九二九年，它们的比率只占百分之四十六。换句话说，收入在二十五万以下的公司，在一九二九年时还有全国生产资金的百分之十九·一，到一九四二年则减到百分之一·六了。
    罗斯福时代大企业的生长，主要并不是各个公司间的互相合并，而是由于大企业家间的合并。这种合并的情形，在一九一九年到一九二九年之间，特别显然，尤其以在钢铁业，机器制造业，食器制造等，电影业，旅馆工业方面最多。当然电力工厂控制权的集中，也是众所共知的。
    一九二九年合并单位，比较一九一九年多三倍，当不景气期间和实施新政从事复兴的阶段中，工商业合并的数目就骤然降低了。工业中的趋势，一变而为现存大企业的扩展增长。
    谁是大亨？
    各大公司的宣传，都说股票是分散给百万个股东的，因此大企业的管理是民主化的。但事实上，根据“证券与汇兑委员会”的研究：在战前、约有一万八（占人口总数的十万分之八），拥有全国四分之一的股票，而七万五千人（万分之六的人）拥有全国股票的一半。有一千个人最大分红者，分得了全国各种红利的百分之一○·四，有六万一千个人得到全国所有红利的二分之一。
    在二百家最大非金融性的企业组织中，有百分之六十的股票是由最上层百分之一的大股东们所拥有的。这二百家之中，有四分之一的公司，其股票是由二十个大股东所拥有的。另外约有四十家大企业组织，也有二十个最大的股东，拥有百分之二十五到五十的股票总额——这就足够控制该公司所需的股票数量了。此外，有三个大亨——杜邦、梅隆和洛克裴勒控制了这二百个最大企业中的十五个单位，资产总值约有八十万万元。除了上述情形以外，许多大亨们又利用委托、连环董事会、投资托辣斯以及银行附属机关的联系，间接的控制着更多的大企业组织。在一九三五年，二百家最大的公司以及五十家最大的金融组织，是被四百个大亨所控制着的，如果上项研究是正确的，我们可以想象到一九四五年到一九五五年的集中情形了。
    当初创办的小企业是很多的，但是许多都失败了，只有少数的获得了成功，更少的一部分小企业得到机会渐渐成长。破产数字和低微利润所表现出来的商业危机，都是指的小工商业而言；“商业危机”其实乃是大企业家自拉自唱的宣传。
