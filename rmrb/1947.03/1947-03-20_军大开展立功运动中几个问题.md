Several Issues in the Launch of the Merit Campaign at the Military and Political University
    Li Yun

Since January, the Military and Political University has enthusiastically launched a merit campaign on the education front, presenting an unprecedentedly vigorous new atmosphere in both work and study. Now, some preliminary materials explored are provided as a reference for institutions and schools to carry out this campaign:

    I. Breaking Obstacles and Entering the Movement

After the merit campaign was proposed, the following ideological understandings hindering the development of the movement were discovered: some believed that there was no merit to be gained in studying at school and that to gain merit, one must go to the front line; some said that it was enough to do whatever they were told, so why start a merit campaign? Some mystified the concept of merit, saying that it was for big figures to do earth-shattering things, and that since they had neither ability nor skill, how could they gain any merit; others believed that the merit campaign was a new trick by the higher leadership, designed to stimulate everyone's emotions or specifically to deal with backward elements; and the most common was the "neither forward nor backward" mentality. Their attitude was, neither to advance as a hero nor to fall behind as a turtle, "not seeking" merit, but only seeking to avoid mistakes. Everyone called this mentality the "riding a donkey" mentality. In addition, during the movement, thoughts of being jealous of others who gained merit, fearing that others would progress, etc., were also discovered. The leadership's responsibility lies in breaking these obstacles to ensure the smooth development of the movement. We first studied Commander-in-Chief Zhu's "On Revolutionary Heroism" among the cadres, enabling them to grasp the basic spirit of the merit campaign, which was the first step. Then, we conducted top-down mobilization and bottom-up deliberation, putting forward slogans such as "Everyone has achievements, everyone gains merit," "First be a study hero, then be an enemy-killing hero," and "Develop one's special skills and gain merit for the people in all aspects" during the mobilization. In the deliberation, we fostered correct understandings to overcome incorrect ones. Furthermore, it was explained that the merit campaign was to promote everyone's high level of enthusiasm and creativity to promote work, so it was necessary to implement merit recording, record achievements, and break the vague understanding and intermediate attitude towards the merit campaign, which was the second step. Third, we must initiate merit-based competitions from the bottom up, and formulate individual, mutual aid group, class, and company merit plans. We have done well in this respect, and everyone has formulated their own study plans (i.e., merit plans), and individual to individual, class to class, team to team, cadres, and administrative staff have universally challenged each other. The brigade and company organized merit committees to specifically lead and control this movement.

    II. Merit Standards and Merit Plans

When enthusiasm was aroused, all comrades worked and studied very well. What exactly counts as merit, and what doesn't? What goals should merit be based on? These became the issues that needed to be resolved. Some comrades said: "Work done is merit, and completing courses is merit," while others said: "Having a little bit of an advantage doesn't count as merit".... The leadership's approach was to first let everyone deliberate on a merit standard from the bottom up, at the class, company, brigade, and entire school levels, and then summarize it into a unified merit standard. After deliberation, our merit standards are basically as follows:

    Trainee Aspect: 1. Actively practice hard and delve into military training and political study with obvious progress. 2. Have new creations in learning that promote learning, exceed learning requirements, and create new records. 3. Good unity and mutual assistance, with significant results in teaching others. 4. Rapid ideological progress, good contact with the masses, and play a leading role. 5. Significant achievements in daily life, club work, community work, etc.
    Cadre Aspect: 1. Face the students, serve the students, work meticulously and deeply, and integrate with the students. 2. Care about the students' political and material lives, so that the students can study with peace of mind. 3. Actively learn new leadership styles, develop the students' special skills, and promptly summarize and exchange experiences.
    Administrative Staff Aspect: 1. Try every means to do their job well (such as cooks making good meals, breeders fattening livestock, etc.) to ensure that students' learning and cadres' work are not affected. 2. Save things. 3. Unite students and comrades. 4. Strive to learn and abide by mass discipline.

Based on this merit standard, comrades in various positions then formulated their own merit plans. First, these plans must revolve around a central theme: teaching well and learning well, and should not be stretched too wide; second, they must be specific (i.e., political, administrative, supply, health, etc. departments and personnel should all formulate their own merit plans). Third, the time for the plan should not be too long, and should be checked in a timely manner and gradually improved; if it is stretched too long, the effect cannot be seen quickly, and the supervision function will be lost. Fourth, after the plan is formulated, it should be announced in various forms: posted in the form of oaths; read aloud publicly in the form of pledges; exchanged with each other in the form of challenges. In this way, not only is there a principled but also a specific goal to strive for, which can organize the enthusiasm of the masses in the right direction.

    III. Merit Recording Issues

Merit recording is a weapon to promote the merit campaign forward, and an indispensable part of the merit campaign. At the beginning, merit recording was generally too fragmented (such as fetching water and sweeping the floor) and too mundane. Later, after research, merit recording was implemented according to the merit standards mentioned in the previous section, and some necessary measures were stipulated, and the problem was solved. What are some of the practices?

Merit recording is divided into several types: for individuals, mutual aid groups, classes, and companies, etc. If a comrade or a mutual aid group has outstanding achievements and creations in the class, they can be recorded in the class merit book; if they are outstanding in the company and play a promoting role, they are recorded in the company merit book; if they are outstanding in the entire brigade and have a promoting effect, their deeds are recorded in the brigade merit book. The procedure for recording merit is: class merit must be approved by the majority of the class, company merit must be approved by the company's merit committee and agreed by everyone, and brigade merit must be approved by the brigade's merit committee and agreed by each team, which means democratic merit evaluation. When recording merit, the facts must be written clearly, and only merit is recorded, not demerits. The merit book is different from the daily life review record book, it is specifically to record everyone's contribution to the revolution. Administrative staff and cadres also have their own merit books.

The use of merit recording and learning has played a great role in promoting: for example, when the higher authorities called on the military team to throw grenades and record merit for each person exceeding thirty-five meters, the result was that the team averaged thirty-eight meters and three centimeters. When the higher authorities called for literary and artistic work to be closely integrated with learning, and to practice the principle of "literary and artistic work serving learning," a mass creation craze was immediately launched. A certain class proposed that the class would be recorded for one merit if they could jump over the wooden horse, and as a result, the class all passed the wooden horse within a few days. A certain class proposed that one merit would be recorded for helping others correct a movement, and as a result, the class quickly achieved balanced development. A certain team proposed that merit would be recorded for new creations in learning, and as a result, each class had new inventions. In a word, merit recording has become a powerful driving force for the advancement of work. The slogans put forward by everyone are: "Compare one competition and one competition, see who has more merit!" "Not afraid of more merit, only afraid of less merit!" "Whoever works hard has merit," "Accumulate achievements and add merit to merit." Because the policy of developing one's special skills has been implemented, almost everyone has gained a merit or two, and everyone feels that on the merit front, having a good skill can make one stand out.

    IV. Merit Recognition Issues

Another indispensable thing in the merit campaign is "merit recognition." Merit recognition in the revolutionary ranks is not bragging and exaggeration, nor is it making something out of nothing, but rather stating the facts as they are, honestly, and using various ways to express merit when it is gained. The purpose of merit recognition is to promote good things and let everyone learn from them, so as to promote them, which is in line with the requirements of the merit campaign. If merit is not widely disseminated, it can only play a role in the unit and cannot promote and influence others. We have adopted the following methods in terms of merit recognition: (1) Posted on blackboards. (2) Broadcasted orally in front of the masses. (3) Issued merit lists. (4) Expressed or performed in artistic forms. (5) Published in newspapers. (6) Issued circulars. (7) Issued merit certificates (such as when the first brigade made a preliminary summary of military training, it issued ten merit certificates). (8) Formally convene meetings and convey them in the form of exchanging experiences (such as the first and second brigades have specially convened conferences to allow classes, mutual aid groups, and individuals with merit to spread their experiences). (9) Elect heroes and models and reward them (such as the recent first and second brigades have convened learning representative meetings or little hero meetings). (10) Write the merit gained by each person on the appraisal form for long-term glory.

Breaking ideological obstacles, launching merit competitions, organizing the enthusiasm of the masses to advance towards certain goals, merit recording and merit recognition, these four are indispensable links in the merit campaign.

　　军大开展立功运动中几个问题
    立云
    一月以来，军政大学在教育战线上热烈开展了立功运动，在工作和学习方面都呈现出来从未有的生气勃勃的新气象。现将初步摸索到的一些材料提供出来，作为机关学校开展这一运动的参考：
    一、打破障碍进入运动
    立功运动提出后，发现下面几种阻碍运动开展的认识思想：有的认为在学校学习无功可立，要立功必须上前线；有的说叫干什么干什么就行了，何必来个立功？有的把立功神秘化了，说立功是大人物干的轰轰烈烈的大事，咱既无本事又无能耐，还能立什么功；还有认为立功是上级领导上的新花样，是刺激大家情绪或专用来对付落后分子的；而最多的是不前不后的思想，他们的态度是，既不前进作英雄，也不落后当乌龟，“不求”功，但求无过”，大家叫这种思想为“骑毛驴”思想。此外在运动过程中还发现怕别人立了功自己不能立功嫉妒别人，害怕别人进步等思想。领导责任在于打破这些障碍，使运动顺利开展。我们首先在干部中学习了朱总司令的论革命的英雄主义，使干部掌握了立功运动的基本精神，这是第一步；接着进行自上而下的动员和自下而上的酝酿，在动员中提出“人人有成绩，个个立功劳”“先当学习英雄，再当杀敌英雄”；“发扬一技之长，从各个方面为人民立功”等口号；在醒酿中扶植正确的认识以克服不正确的认识。此外说明立功运动是发扬每个人高度的积极性与创造性，用以推动工作，因此必须实行记功，记载成绩，打破对立功运动的模糊认识和中间态度，这是第二步骤。第三，就要从下而上发起立功竞赛，订立个人的、互助组的、班的、连队的立功计划。我们在这一点上作得还好，每个人都订了自己的学习计划（即立功计划），个人与个人、班与班、队与队、干部、事务人员普遍的进行了挑战。大队连队组织了立功委员会，专门领导与掌握这一运动。
    二、立功标准和立功计划
    当积极性发动起来后，各个同志工作学习都很好，究竟那些算是功，那些不算功？立功本着什么目标去立，就成为需要解决的问题。有同志说：“工作做了就是有了功，课目学完就是有了功”，有的说：“有一点优点不算功”……。领导上的作法就是首先让大家由下而上酝酿出一个立功标准。班的、连队的、大队的、全校的，然后归纳成一个统一的立功标准，经过酝酿，我们的立功标准基本上是这样：
    学员方面：１、练兵和政治学习中积极苦练钻研有明显进步。２、学习上有新创造对学习起了推动作用，超过学习要求创造新纪录。３、团结互助好，教导别人成绩显著。４、思想进步快，联系群众好，起带头作用。５、日常生活、俱乐部工作、居民工作等成绩显著。
    干部方面：１、面向同学，为同学服务，工作细致深入和同学打成一片。２、关心同学政治生活和物质生活，使同学安心学习。３、积极学习新的领导作风，发扬同学一技之长，及时总结和交流经验。
    事务人员方面：１、想尽办法把自己工作作好（如炊事员饭菜作好，饲养员牲口喂肥等）保证同学学习干部工作不受影响。２、节约东西。３、团结同学和同志。４、努力学习并遵守群众纪律。
    根据这个立功标准，各个岗位的同志再订出自己的立功计划。这些计划第一，必须围绕一个中心——教好学好，不能拉得太宽；第二，必须是具体的（即政治、行政、供给、卫生……各部门各人员。都订出自己的立功计划）。第三，计划的时间不可太长，应及时检查，逐步提高；拉得太长不能很快看到效果，会失去督查作用。第四，计划订出后要用各种形式公布出来：用誓词形式张贴起来；用宣誓方式当众宣读；用挑战书形式互相交换。这样不仅有了原则上的，而且有了具体的奋斗目标，就能把群众的积极性组织到正确的方向。
    三、记功问题
    记功是推动立功运动前进的武器，是立功运动中不可缺少的一部分。开始记功一般失于太零碎（如打水扫地）太平淡；后来经过研究，根据上节所谈立功标准实行记功，并规定一些必要的办法，问题就解决了，有那些作法呢？
    记功分对于个人的、互助组的、班的、连队的等几种；一个同志式或一个互助组在班里有突出成绩和创造就可以在班功劳簿上记功；在连队突出并起了推动作用的就在连队功劳簿上记功；在全大队突出并有推动作用的事迹，就在大队功劳簿记功。记功的手续是：班功必须经过全班大多数同意，连功必须经过连的立功委员会通过并经大家同意，大队功经大队立功委员会通过各队同意，也就是民主评功的意思。记功时要把事实写清楚，只记功劳不记过失。功劳簿不同于日常生活检讨记录簿，它是专记载大家对革命的贡献的。事务人员和干部也都有自己的记功簿。
    运用记功和学习起了很大推动作用：如上级号召军事队投手榴弹每人超过三十五米就记功，结果一队打到平均三十八米三。上级号召文娱工作要和学习密切结合，实践“文娱工作为学习服务”的方针，马上普遍掀起了群众性的创作热潮。某班提出能跳过木马班上记一功，结果该班几天之内全部通过了木马。某班提出帮人纠正好一个动作记一功，结果很快该班达到了发展平衡。某队提出学习上有新创造就记功，结果各班都有新发明。一句话，记功成了工作前进的有力推动机。大家提出的口号是：“比一比赛一赛，看谁的功多！”“不怕功多，只怕功少！”“谁努力谁就有功劳”，“成绩垒成绩，功劳加功劳。”因为实行了发扬一技之长的方针，差不多每人都立了个把功劳，大家感到在立功战线上，有一门好的，就可以出头。
    四、表功问题
    立功运动中还有一件不可缺少的事，就是“表功”。革命队伍里的表功，并不是吹牛夸大，也不是无中生有，而是就事论事，老老实实，有了功就用各种方式表出来。表功的目的，是为了把好的东西发扬起来，让大家学，借以推广，这正合乎立功运动的要求。如立了功不广泛传播，则只能在该单位起作用，亦不能推动与影响其他。我们在表功方面采用了这样一些办法：（一）用黑板报登载。（二）用口头在群众面前广播。（三）出功劳榜。（四）用艺术形式表达或演出。（五）登在报纸上。（六）发通报。（七）印发功状（如一大队在军事练兵初步总结时就颁发了十个功状）。（八）正式招开会议，用交流经验的方式传达。（如一、二大队都专门召集了大会，让有功劳的班、互助组，个人传播他们的经验”。（九）选举英雄模范并予以奖励（如最近一、二大队都召开了学习代表会或小英雄会。）（十）把每人立的功写在鉴定表上，长久光荣。
    打破思想障碍，掀起立功竞赛，组织群众的积极性向一定的目标前进，记功和表功，此四者是立功运动中不可缺少的环节。
