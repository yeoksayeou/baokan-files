    Newspaper Distribution Work in the Qinyang Guerrilla Area
    Cheng Qingfeng
    After the enemy occupied Qinyang City on November 14th last year, the postal comrades withdrew, and the people south of the Qin River knew nothing. With the development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, postal comrades went to the south of the Qin River to carry out newspaper distribution work. When the newspapers were delivered to the readers, they were truly delighted. This was around November 25th or 26th, and the newspaper subscription period had passed, and the original distribution organization had collapsed. So, the postal comrades borrowed some money from the district office to subscribe to the newspapers. When the newspapers were delivered to the readers, they were very grateful, and of course, paid the newspaper fees in full to the post office. With this development, newspaper subscriptions returned to normal the following month. Although the area was smaller and the environment had changed, the number of newspapers increased. Taking the Taihang Xinhua Daily as an example, it went from 165 copies in November to 120 copies in December, and then to 185 copies in January of this year. The People's Daily increased from 45 copies to 57 copies. They distributed a total of three kinds of newspapers (Xinhua Daily, People's Daily, and New Life Daily), totaling 238 copies. The guerrilla area and the consolidated area together have only seventy or so natural villages, with each village averaging almost four newspapers. The target audience included the military, the government, and merchants, etc. Rural postal stations and postal agencies were re-established, and the foundation for distribution was consolidated.

    How did the Qinyang Post Office achieve such results? First of all, under the leadership of Director Zhang, the distribution staff had a very clear understanding of serving the masses by distributing Party newspapers, and they had full confidence. They realized the people's love for the Party newspapers. In the village where the post office was located, if the villagers knew they were distributing newspapers, many people would come to look at the newspapers and ask about the news of victory. They would ask, "How is the fighting going now?" "When will we attack Qinyang City?" The postal comrades also helped with the village work, and it was common to see cadres reading newspapers, looking for examples of land reform, or methods of distributing the fruits of victory. The villagers of XX village wanted to put on a play but didn't have a script, so they asked the postal comrades for help. Later, they found some kuaiban (clapper talk) and stories in the supplement of the People's Daily. The villagers were very happy and said with a smile, "We thought the newspaper only published news, who knew it had these things too, it's great, let's subscribe to a few copies." Voluntary teachers said, "Without reading the newspaper, there's nothing to talk about in class." With so many facts, the postal comrades knew that the newspapers were needed by the masses, so they actively tried every means to deliver the newspapers to the readers.

    Furthermore, they had a very good distribution organization. The first step was to set up newspaper subscription points in central villages or market towns to facilitate mass subscriptions, and to give a 10% commission, so the subscription points were more responsible for subscribing and forwarding newspapers. The second step was to establish rural postal stations, with each station organizing twenty or so people to take turns delivering newspapers, mail, and official documents. This was more secure than the previous method of incidental delivery and reduced the phenomenon of loss and backlog. The time was of course very fast, and the Taihang Xinhua Daily could be seen throughout the county on the seventh day.

    Furthermore, the procedures were strict, and there must be a register for delivering newspapers, and never a newspaper was lost.

    If your address changed, as long as you notified the post office, they could forward the newspaper to you. They also adopted the method of picking up newspapers from the outside in, in the past, Bo'ai sent to Qinyang, now Qinyang goes to Bo'ai to pick up. The stations along the way can also promote and distribute newspapers, so they are not afraid of not finding the address.

    The most important point is that they rely on the masses and have close ties with the Party, government, and military. Rural postal stations and subscription points all utilize mass organizations and rely on armed forces.

    沁阳游击区的报纸发行工作
    程庆丰
    敌人去年十一月十四日侵占了沁阳城以后，邮局同志撤退，沁河以南的人们啥也不知道了。随着敌后游击战争的开展，邮局同志到沁河南开展报纸发行工作。当报纸送到读者手里，读者真是高兴极了。这时正是十一月廿五、六日，报纸的预订期间过去了，原来的发行组织也垮了。这样邮局同志便和区公所借了部分款，把报纸订下。报纸送到读者手里他们十分感激，报费当然照数交给邮局。这样发展之下，第二个月就照常订起报来。虽是地区缩小，环境改变，但是报纸的份数却增加了。就以太行新华日报来讲，十一月份一百六十五份，十二月一百廿份，今年一月份后一百八十五份。人民日报由四十五份增到五十七份。他们共发三种报纸（新华日报、人民日报、新生报）共是二百三十八份。游击区和巩固区一同算上也不过七十几个自然村，每个村子，差不多平均到四份报纸。对象是军队、政权、商人等等。乡村邮站、邮政代办所也重新建立，发行的基础巩固了。
    沁阳邮局如何能收到这样的成绩呢？首先在张局长的领导之下，发行人员为党报发行，为群众服务思想上很明确，并且有充分的信心，他们体会到群众对党报的爱戴。在邮局住的村子，如果老乡们知道他们是发行报纸时，就有不少的人，来找报纸看，来问胜利消息。他们这样的问：“现在打的怎样了？”“什么时候打沁阳城？”邮局同志也帮助村里工作，常见干部在看报纸，找翻身的例子，或是分配果实的办法。××村的老乡要演剧，没有剧本，找邮局同志想办法。后来在人民日报的副刊上，找到了一些快板和故事，老乡们很高兴，并笑着说：“只当报纸光登消息，谁知道还有这些事，真好，咱们也订几份。”义务教员说：“不看报纸，上课就没讲的了。”这样许许多多的事实，邮局的同志知道报纸为群众所需要，就更积极的想尽办法把报纸送到读者手里。
    再者：他们有很好的发行组织，第一步在中心的村子或是集镇的地方，设立有报纸代订所，便利群众订阅。并给予百分之十的手续费，这样代办所订报、转报就更负责。第二步是建立乡村邮站，每个站组织有二十几个人，轮着送报、邮件、公文等。比以前的捎报是要保险，减少了遗失和积压的现象。时间当然很快，太行新华日报第七天全县都能看到。
    再者在手续上是严格的，送报纸一定要有登记簿，从来没有遗失过一份报纸。
    如果你的地址转移，只要你通知邮局，就能将报纸转给。他们又采取由外而内的取报办法，过去是博爱送沁阳，现在是沁阳到博爱拿。沿站并能将报纸推发，这样亦不怕地址找不见。
    最主要一点，他们是依靠群众，党政军联系密切。乡村邮站、代订所，都是利用群众组织，依靠武装。
