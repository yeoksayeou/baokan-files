    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 18th] Postal work in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has greatly improved during the "Performing Meritorious Service for the People" campaign. The Shouzhang County Bureau has been able to distribute newspapers rapidly to rural areas. Since the county bureau chief conference thoroughly studied the issue of village distribution networks, the postal workers in the county have clarified the importance of distributing Party newspapers ideologically and have all made personal plans. In January, each person organized a distribution network for one district and developed each primary school in the district to receive one copy of the newspaper. In less than two months, seven of the county's eight districts have organized a total of twenty-five locations, developing twenty-seven rural subscribers and fifty-six primary school subscribers, totaling eighty-three subscriptions. In January, the county only had 307 newspaper subscriptions, but now it has increased to 390, all of which are distributed through the distribution network. Postal workers deliver newspapers to each distribution network every day. The distribution network is organized with subscribers within five *li* forming a point, and newspapers reach subscribers within four days of publication.

    建立农村发行网
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】冀鲁豫邮政工作在为人民立功运动中大有改进，寿张县局已能把报纸迅速的发行到农村。自县局长会议上详细研究了村发行网问题后，该县邮工人员在思想上明确了发行党报的重要性，都订出个人计划。一月份每人组织起一个区的发行网，并把该区小学发展到每处一份报。不满两个月，全县八个区已组织起七个区共二十五处，发展农村订户二十七份，小学订户五十六份，共八十三份。一月份全县报纸仅三百零七份，现已增加到三百九十份，都是按发行网分发。邮工每天送到每个发行网，发行网是五里以内订户组织为一个点，从出版日起四天就到达各订户手中。
