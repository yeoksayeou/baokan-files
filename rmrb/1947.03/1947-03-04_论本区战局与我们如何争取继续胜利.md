On the Battle Situation in Our Region and How We Can Strive for Continued Victory

　　The battle situation in our region has undergone significant changes since November of last year. The initiative has gradually shifted into our hands. After more than three months of continuous victories, a full-scale counter-offensive is approaching day by day. The re-entrapment of Jiang's troops in cities such as Dingtao, Cao County, and Juye in southwestern Shandong will become a prelude to our army's new victory, just as Jiang's troops' temporary occupation of Linyi became a prelude to the unprecedented great victory of the East China People's Liberation Army.

　　According to our understanding, in the past eight months, the Jiang Jieshi reactionary clique has planned and implemented four major operations against our region: From August to September last year, Jiang Jieshi's military goal was to "drive Liu Bocheng's main force north of the Longhai Railway and annihilate it," and he dispatched forces of more than twenty brigades; from September to November, Jiang Jieshi actively diverted the Yellow River to its old course, attempting to complete a Yellow River blockade line of more than a thousand miles from Fenglingdu in the west to Jinan in the east, and build a broad forward position on the north bank to "firmly control" the vast plains of southwestern Shandong; from November to January this year, Jiang Jieshi used the entire strength of the Wang Jingjiu and Wang Zhonglian groups to "design" two "plans" to open the Pinghan Railway (Anyang to Yuanshi section), and shouted on his puppet newspapers as if something important had happened that "Handan has fallen"; after the major annihilation battles of Huaibei and southern Shandong, Jiang Jieshi was forced to change his strategic deployment, implement key deployment, and attempt to transfer the entire Wang Jingjiu group from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield to a decisive battle in southern Shandong. However, Jiang Jieshi's entire plan was completely shattered. Jiang Jieshi neither occupied Handan nor opened the Pinghan Railway, nor was he able to prevent our army from launching a local counter-offensive after November last year, and with the force of a thunderbolt, crossed the Yellow River's natural barrier and returned to the Longhai Railway. At this time, although the Wang Jingjiu group had arrived near Dangshan, it was dragged back to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield by our large forces and could not advance eastward. In eight months, Jiang's army lost a full twenty brigades on the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, while our army became stronger and stronger and its military prestige increased day by day.

　　After a series of operational plans of Jiang's army went bankrupt, from mid-February, Jiang Jieshi began to implement his new adventure in our region: using the entire Wang Jingjiu group combined with the main force of the Wang Zhonglian group, and transferring the 72nd Division from Wuhan and the 48th Division from Anqing, to launch a campaign offensive against our southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan regions. This offensive is the best proof of the severe failure of Jiang Jieshi's operational plan. This is the victorious result of our main force launching a continuous offensive on the Longhai Railway to disrupt the Wang Jingjiu group's plan to reinforce southern Shandong, forcing Jiang Jieshi to leave twelve brigades on the Longhai Railway and its north and south areas to take offensive defense. Jiang's army's current offensive cannot be regarded as a simple cycle of last year's southwestern Shandong offensive. The scale and nature of this offensive are completely different from half a year ago. The entire force that has penetrated into southwestern Shandong is only eight brigades, exhausted, with low morale, and difficult to supply. The deeper their feet sink, the more difficult it becomes for them to extricate themselves. Our army, on the other hand, is full of confidence, which has created favorable conditions for our main force to continue to annihilate a large number of Jiang's troops and achieve the strategic goal of coordinating with the operations of the fraternal corps in southern Shandong. We expect that Jiang's army's offensive will suffer even more serious failures than in the past in the near future.

　　The basic principle of war guidance is "to preserve one's own living forces and annihilate the enemy's living forces," which is the decisive factor for victory. In the past eight months of the self-defense war, in the serious struggle, we correctly implemented this principle, preserved and strengthened our own forces, and annihilated Jiang's army by up to twenty brigades, achieving our expected strategic goals. The fundamental change in the battle situation started from this basis. As long as we firmly grasp this principle, continue our past efforts, give full play to our favorable conditions, and gather the victories of many large and small annihilation battles, and annihilate a dozen more brigades of Jiang's army, we can completely stop Jiang's army's offensive in the entire region, seize the initiative in the battle situation, and adapt to the situation of the war development in the entire liberated area to enter a strategic counter-offensive. Although Jiang's army has temporarily occupied cities such as Juye, Jiaxiang, and Dingtao, and although Jiang's army may continue to conduct repeated "sweeps" and "suppressions" in certain areas of our region, and even re-occupy certain towns and cities, there is no doubt that our army will win and Jiang's army will be defeated.

　　At present, in order to strive for victory on the front line, victory on the rear front, and victory in the occupied areas, to continue to strengthen our own strength and annihilate a large number of Jiang's troops, and to quickly realize the situation of counter-offensive, we should carefully study the development of the battle situation at any time, and be more clear in our minds about the current struggle policy, and strive to prepare more diligently for the conditions for winning continued victories.

　　First of all, in strengthening combat, we must resolutely implement the policy of mobile warfare, advance and retreat in large strides, not count the gains and losses of a city or a place, and look for the enemy's weaknesses to annihilate the enemy's living forces in large numbers in the movement. We should not only annihilate the enemy's quantity, but also thoroughly annihilate Jiang's army's direct line and backbone. Not only can the main force annihilate the enemy in large numbers, but all military regions, corps, and guerrilla units should also strive for continuous annihilation battles by using the principle of "concentrating great force to attack the enemy's small part." This requires us to take advantage of all available gaps to diligently train soldiers, combining combat and training, and striving a hundred times to improve the tactics and techniques, physical strength and foot strength of all troops, especially new corps, and improve the ability to fight fiercely for several consecutive days and nights; at the same time, combine politics and technology, leadership and the masses, greatly develop the mass line, and universally carry out the merit-making movement and the mutual assistance movement.

　　We must adhere to guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas and carry out guerrilla warfare in the Jiang-controlled areas to prepare for the counter-offensive. In terms of the entire self-defense war, mobile warfare is the main thing and guerrilla warfare is auxiliary. However, if we ignore the strategic position of guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas and the Jiang-controlled areas and do not seriously build and guide mass guerrilla warfare, we cannot win the self-defense war. Therefore, we must fiercely and boldly mobilize the masses, rely closely on the masses, and arm the masses to rise up to defend their homes and defend their motherland. This requires us to overcome the imbalance of guerrilla warfare in different regions and universally carry out guerrilla warfare in all areas bordering the enemy. At the same time, we cannot only stop at the anti-"reverse settlement," but must combine the creativity of the masses to further concretely develop the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance." Fiercely strengthen the people's forces in the occupied areas and the Jiang-controlled areas, establish guerrilla base areas, cooperate with the main force's frontal operations, hold back the enemy, attack the enemy's plunder, thoroughly smash their conspiracy to use war to support war, improve the combat effectiveness of the guerrilla teams, create conditions for mobile warfare, and coordinate with the main force's counter-offensive to recover lost ground.

　　We must thoroughly implement land reform and the filling movement, fully carry out the great production movement (including thrift), and strengthen current affairs education. This is the task of implementing the entire year in rear work, which is the source of victory for the people's war. We must do these three things well to increase the wealth of the people in the entire region, improve the ideological awareness of the army and the people, prepare for the counter-offensive, and ensure that front-line soldiers, cadres, and supplies such as clothing, food, and ammunition can be continuously replenished. This requires us to work deeply, meticulously organize and mobilize, and accurately and scientifically calculate. We must achieve a victory on the rear front that is as important as the one on the front line.

　　On the eve of the counter-offensive, the war will be unprecedentedly tense and frequent, and the reactionaries will do their best to struggle to the death. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings in continuous victories: "Guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be cautious and humble." Beware of the possible growth of complacency and slackness, and beware of the revival of peace illusions in new forms. All illusions that victory can be easily achieved are very wrong, and this is our most important enemy. We must be clear about the concept of long-term struggle, and we must engage in combat and the struggle to thoroughly eliminate feudalism with the most serious and prudent attitude, relying closely on the masses, and with the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. In this way, we will be invincible.

### 论本区战局与我们如何争取继续胜利

　　论本区战局与我们如何争取继续胜利
    本区战局自去年十一月以来已发生重大变化，主动权逐渐转入我手，经过三个多月来的连续胜利，全面反攻已日益逼近，蒋军之重陷鲁西南定陶、曹县、巨野诸城，将成为我军新的胜利的前奏，正如蒋军之暂时侵占临沂成为华东人民解放军空前伟大胜利的前奏是一样的。
    据我们了解，过去八个月中，蒋介石反动派对本区曾计划和实施过四次大的作战：去年八月到九月蒋介石的军事目标是“驱逐刘伯承主力于陇海线以北而歼灭之”，并出动了兵力在二十个旅以上；九月到十一月蒋介石积极引黄归故，企图西起风陵渡东迄济南完成一条长逾千里的黄河封锁线，并在北岸筑成一条横宽的前进阵地，“确掌”鲁西南广大平原；十一月到今年一月，蒋介石以王敬久、王仲廉两集团全部力量“设计”过两次打通平汉线（安阳至元氏段）的“方案”，并在其御用报纸上像煞有介事的叫喊“邯郸已经陷落”；当淮北、鲁南两大歼灭战以后，蒋介石被迫变动其战略部署，实行重点配置，又企图将王敬久集团从冀鲁豫战场全部调鲁南决战。但蒋介石的全套计划是彻底破灭了，蒋介石既未占领邯郸及打通平汉线，亦未能阻止我军于去年十一月以后发动局部反攻，并以雷霆万钧之势越过黄河天险，重临陇海线上。此时王敬久集团虽已开抵砀山附近，但在我大军压迫下仍被我拖回到冀鲁豫战场，东进不得。在八个月中，蒋军在晋冀鲁豫战场足足丧失了二十个旅，而我军却愈战愈强、军威日盛。
    蒋军一连串作战计划破产以后，二月中旬起，蒋介石又开始对本区实行其新的冒险：以王敬久集团全部结合王仲廉集团主力，并从武汉增调七十二师，从安庆增调四十八师，向我鲁西南及豫东地区发动战役攻势。这一攻势是蒋介石作战计划遭受严重失败的最好不过的证明。这是我主力军发动陇海线连续攻势破坏王敬久集团增援鲁南计划的胜利结果，迫使蒋介石不得不以十二个旅兵力留置陇海线及其南北地区采取攻势防御。蒋军此次攻势决不能看做是去年鲁西南攻势的简单循环，这次攻势规模与性质和半年以前已迥然不同了，其深入鲁西南的全部兵力不过八个旅，疲惫不堪，斗志不高，补给困难，泥足愈陷愈深，而我军则信心百倍，这样就造成了我们主力继续歼灭大量蒋军的有利条件，和达成策应鲁南兄弟兵团作战的战略目的。我们预料蒋军这一攻势必将在不久的将来遭受比过去更严重的失败。
    战争指导的基本原则即是“保存自己有生力量，歼灭敌人有生力量”，这是胜利的决定因素。过去八个月的自卫战争，在严重斗争中，我们正确的执行了这一原则，保存和壮大了自己的力量，歼灭蒋军达二十个旅，达成了我们预期的战略目的，战局的基本变化就是从这一基础上开始的。只要我们紧紧掌握这个原则，继续过去的努力，发挥我们的有利条件，集合许多大大小小的歼灭战的胜利，再歼灭蒋军十几个旅，我们在全区就可以完全停止蒋军进攻，掌握战局的主动，适应全解放区战争发展的形势进入战略反攻。尽管蒋军暂时侵陷了巨野、嘉祥、定陶等城，尽管蒋军还可能对本区某些地区继续进行反复“扫荡”、“清剿”，甚至再侵占某些城镇，但我军必胜蒋军必败之局，是毫无疑问的。
    目前我们为着争取前线上的胜利，后方战线上的胜利，和沦陷区的胜利，以继续壮大自己的力量，歼灭大量蒋军，为着迅速实现反攻的局面，对于战局的发展应当随时细心研究，对于当前斗争的方针在思想上要更加明确，对于争取继续胜利的条件应当更加努力的去做准备。
    首先在加强作战方面，必须坚决贯彻运动战的方针，大踏步进退，不计一城一地得失，辗转寻找敌人弱点，在运动中大量歼灭蒋军有生力量。我们不仅应该歼灭敌人数量，且须彻底歼灭蒋军的嫡系和骨干。不仅主力能大量歼敌，一切军区兵团和游击部队同样应以“集中大力打敌小部”的原则争取连续的歼灭战的胜利。这就必须利用一切可以利用的空隙发奋练兵，使战斗与训练结合，百倍地努力以提高一切部队特别是新兵团的战术和技术、体力和脚力、提高连续数昼夜激战的能力；同时使政治与技术结合，领导与群众结合，大大发扬群众路线，普遍开展立功运动、互助运动。
    必须坚持沦陷区游击战争，开展蒋管区游击战争，为反攻作准备。就整个自卫战争来说运动战为主，游击战为辅，但忽视沦陷区和蒋管区游击战争的战略地位，不认真去建设和指导群众游击战争，也不能取得自卫战争的胜利。因此，必须猛烈放手发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，武装群众自己起来保卫家乡，保卫祖国。这就必须克服游击战争在地区上的不平衡现象，在所有的接敌地区普遍的开展游击战争。同时也不能仅仅停止在反“倒算”上，必须结合群众的创造，进一步具体发挥敌进我进敌不进我亦进的方针。猛烈壮大沦陷区蒋管区的人民力量，建立游击根据地，配合主力正面作战，拖住敌人，打击敌人掠夺，彻底粉碎其以战养战阴谋，提高游击队战斗力，创造运动战条件，以策应主力反攻，收复失地。
    必须彻底贯彻土地改革和填补运动，全力开展大生产运动（包括节约），加强时事教育，这是后方工作中贯彻全年的工作任务，这就是人民战争胜利的源泉。我们必须作好这三件工作，以增加全区人民财富，提高军民的思想觉悟，为反攻准备力量，以保证前线兵员、干部、以及被服粮秣和弹药等都能得到源源补充。这就要我们深入工作，细密组织动员，精确科学的计算，我们必须在后方战线上取得和前线上同等重要的胜利。
    在反攻的前夜，战争将是空前紧张频繁，反动派将全力作垂死挣扎，我们必须在连续的胜利中记取毛主席的伟大教言：“戒骄戒躁，谨慎谦虚。”谨防可能滋长的轻敌懈怠现象，谨防和平幻想以新的形式死灰复燃，一切认为胜利可以轻取的幻想是非常错误的，这是我们最主要的敌人。必须明确长期斗争的观念，必须以最严肃最审慎的态度，紧紧依靠群众、全心全意为人民服务的精神，去从事战斗和彻底消灭封建的斗争，这样我们将是无敌的。
