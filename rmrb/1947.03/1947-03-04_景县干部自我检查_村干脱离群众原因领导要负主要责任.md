Jing County Cadres' Self-Examination
	Leaders Should Bear Primary Responsibility for Village Cadres' Estrangement from the Masses

[From our Jinnan correspondent, 2nd] Jing County examined the reasons for village cadres' estrangement from the masses from the leadership's perspective, mainly focusing on the following three points: (1) County and district cadres should bear the primary responsibility for many village cadres' estrangement from the masses. For example, when cadres go to villages to eat, they don't settle the bills even with meal tickets. When village cadres prepare food and drink, they only say, "Don't violate the system," but still eat it. For example, ten cadres in the ninth district bought thirty pieces of clothing, etc. This easily leads to a situation where "those who eat from others speak softly, and those who take from others act softly," so they often cover up for village cadres without principle. When the masses opposed the activist Wang Zhaohai, the cadres locked the masses in a room and held a "think-think meeting," asking them, "Does he have any good points?" When activist Guo Xiuchang was opposed by the masses, his wife said to the district cadre, "When you come, you eat and drink, but now that we have a problem, you don't care." The district cadre was left speechless. (2) Overemphasizing the merits of village cadres resulted in the suppression of the masses and the ruin of the cadres. Chen Deming, an old activist in Zhaoqiao, bought guns and delivered intelligence to the government during the War of Resistance. During the anti-corruption campaign, the district cadre appointed him as the chairman of the farmers' association. Later, when other village cadres swarmed in to struggle against him, he ran to the district and said, "The reactionaries in my village have risen up, please help me!" The district cadre immediately detained the other village cadres and punished them with some grain. The autumn before last, he led the struggle against the landlord Wu Junpei, eating and drinking lavishly, and slandering others indiscriminately. He didn't distribute the fruits of the struggle to the masses. When the masses demanded that he clear the accounts of the fruits, the district cadre said, "Chen Deming has merit; the person leading the account clearing has a bad class background." The masses said, "The district is in cahoots with him; we're just getting angry for nothing." He said triumphantly, "My position as chairman of the farmers' association has been approved with an official document." After that, he sent the fruits of the struggle to the district cadre, actively corrupting the cadre. On the other hand, he became even more unscrupulous. This unprincipled appeasement, on the contrary, harmed the cadre. (3) Some activists were indeed very good at first, but the leadership failed to educate and criticize them in time, leading to small problems developing into major mistakes.

　　景县干部自我检查
    村干脱离群众原因领导要负主要责任
    【本报冀南二日电】景县从领导上检查村干脱离群众原因，主要有以下三点：（一）很多村干脱离群众，县区干部应负主要责任。如干部到村吃饭，开了饭条也不还账，遇到村干预备酒肉只说：“不要破坏制度”，仍是吃了。又如九区十个干部，即买了衣裳等三十件。这样容易造成“吃了人家的嘴软，拿了人家的手软”就往往无原则替村干打掩护，群众反对积极分子王朝海时，干部即把群众关在屋里开想想会，问群众：“他有好处不？”积极分子郭秀倡被群众反对，他老婆对区干说：“你们来了吃是吃，喝是喝，这时俺有了事，你们不管了。”区干便无话可答。（二）偏重照顾村干功劳，结果，镇压了群众，葬送了干部。赵桥老积极分子陈德明在抗战中给政府买过枪，送过情报，在反贪污时区干指定他为农会主任，后来别的村干涌过来要斗他他即跑到区里说：“我村反动派起来了，帮助我一下吧！”区干即将别的村干扣起来，处罚了一部分粮食。前年秋，他领着斗了地主吴俊培，大吃大喝，乱损他人，果实没分给群众，群众要求向他清理果实，区干即说：“陈德明有功劳，领导清账的人，成份不好。”群众说：“区里和他一事，咱是白生气。”他却得意的说：“我这农会主任批上了牛皮文书了。”此后他一面送给区干斗争果实，积极腐化干部。另方面更无忌惮的胡来，这样无原则迁就的结果，相反的是害了干部。（三）有些积极分子起初确是很好，但是领导上未及时教育批评，以致由小毛病发展为大错误。
