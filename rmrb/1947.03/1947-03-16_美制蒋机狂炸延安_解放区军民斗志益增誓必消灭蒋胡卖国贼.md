　　American-Made Chiang Planes Bomb Yan'an Rampantly
    Liberated Area Soldiers and Civilians' Fighting Spirit Increases, Vowing to Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan Traitors
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th】Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed Yan'an on a large scale on the 13th. A total of 25 Chiang planes (B-24), (B-25), (P-49) and other types of bombers and fighters invaded the airspace over Yan'an in batches from 8:30 a.m., taking turns bombing and strafing for a total of eight hours. Shrapnel collected proves that the bombs were supplied by American imperialism. The border region masses expressed extreme indignation at Chiang's planes indiscriminately bombing the democratic holy land of Yan'an, further increasing their fighting spirit to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan traitors.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on yesterday's (11th) bombing of Yan'an by Chiang's planes, stating: Just as Marshall was in Moscow talking glibly about world peace, the planes that his American imperialist government gave to Chiang Kai-shek came to Yan'an to drop bombs and bomb just seven hours after the US military observation team withdrew. The bombs all fell near the Yan'an headquarters, showing that the bombing target was undoubtedly the Yan'an headquarters. After Chiang Kai-shek used force to drive away the CCP's representatives and liaison personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, openly severing the ten-year connection between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he finally dared to indiscriminately bomb Yan'an. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American imperialism, is determined to fight the civil war to the end, and that the bombing of Yan'an is the opening of his large-scale offensive against Yan'an. The reporter pointed out that no matter how American imperialists support the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the people of the entire liberated area are fully prepared and will surely smash their offensive until the traitorous rule of Chiang Kai-shek is finally eliminated.

　　美制蒋机狂炸延安
    解放区军民斗志益增誓必消灭蒋胡卖国贼
    【新华社延安十四日电】蒋介石飞机于十三日大规模轰炸延安。蒋机（Ｂ２４）、（Ｂ２５）、（Ｐ４９）等各型轰炸机、战斗机共二十五架，自上午八时半起，先后分批侵入延安上空，轮番轰炸并扫射，共历八小时之久。拾得之炸弹片证明，炸弹系美帝国主义所供给。边区群众对蒋机滥炸民主圣地延安，表示极端愤慨，益增消灭蒋胡卖国贼之斗志。
    【新华社延安十二日电】新华社记者论昨日（十一日）蒋机轰炸延安称：正当马歇尔在莫斯科侈谈世界和平之际，他的美帝国主义政府赠给蒋介石的飞机，即在美军观察组人员撤退后七小时来延安投弹轰炸，炸弹悉落延安总部附近，可见其轰炸目标为延安总部无疑。蒋介石以武力赶走中共在南京、上海、重庆的代表联络人员，公然斩断国共十年联系之后，终于竟敢对延安滥施轰炸，可见蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下决心内战到底，而以轰炸延安为其大规模进攻延安之揭幕。记者指出，不论美帝国主义者如何替卖国贼头子蒋介石撑腰，陕甘宁边区和全解放区人民已有充分准备，必能粉碎其进攻，直到最后取消蒋介石的汉奸卖国贼统治。
