    Shexian Sixth High School Organizes Faculty Family Members to Establish Small Textile Factory
    [Our Newspaper, Shexian News] Shexian Sixth High School recently established a small textile factory. Among them are six family members of faculty, and six poor women. In addition, there are five children. The factory has one technician, specializing in teaching textile technology, and one cultural instructor, specializing in the daily ideological education of the female textile workers and one to two hours of cultural learning each day. Meals, except for the technician and cultural instructor who are supplied by the school, are the responsibility of the workers themselves. The school is responsible for supplying raw materials and selling finished products. The profits are divided with 20% going to the school and 80% going to the textile workers. Both male and female students can learn techniques in the factory during their spare time. It is stipulated that female students must learn weaving before graduation. The factory has now set up fifteen spinning wheels and two hand-pulled looms, and plans to expand further.

    涉县六高组织教员家属设小型纺织厂
    【本报涉县讯】涉县六高最近成立小型纺织工厂。其中教员家属六人，贫苦妇女六人，此外尚有五个儿童，厂内设技师一人，专教纺织技术，文化教员一人，专管纺妇们日常思想教育及每天一、两个钟头的文化学习。伙食除技师和文化教员由校方供给，其余是自己解决，校方负责供给原料与推销成品，所赚的钱是二八分红（校二，纺妇八）。男女学生在课余时间均可在厂内学习技术，规定女生毕业时必需学会纺织。工厂现已设置纺车十五辆，手拉梭机两架，计划再发展。
