Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, issued the following statement regarding the Chiang government's breach of contract in implementing the Yellow River breach:

"While launching a large-scale offensive against Yan'an, the Chiang Kai-shek government, in order to coordinate its operations on the south bank of the old Yellow River course, has resorted to the method of breaching the Yellow River, attempting to drown millions of residents in the old Yellow River course and on both banks, to achieve its military goal of isolating our liberated areas. This heinous crime of the Chiang Kai-shek government has completely torn up all previous Yellow River agreements. Originally, all previous agreements stipulated that the closure of the Yellow River breach site must be implemented after the completion of the restoration of dikes and the rescue of refugees in the old course; and the funds for these three tasks should be provided by the Chiang government. The preliminary agreement for these three items of funding was reached as early as last July, but not even half of it has been issued to this day. Moreover, the Chiang government's attack on the liberated areas has made it impossible to carry out the restoration of dikes and flood control projects on both banks of the old Yellow River course for nearly ten months. The UNRRA and UN Relief are participating in the Yellow River agreement and guaranteeing the implementation of this agreement, but they have never censured the Chiang government for its repeated violations of the Yellow River agreement; as a result, the Chiang government dares to disregard everything and close the breach at Huayuankou on March 11. The China UNRRA has long been known as a tool of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, and its partiality, corruption, and incompetence in carrying out relief and rehabilitation work have long been established worldwide. However, the UN Relief, as a global organization, is now also violating its principles, not only politically discriminating against the people in the liberated areas, but also sitting idly by as millions of people in the liberated areas face the danger of death without providing any assistance. I hereby appeal to the world on behalf of the disaster-stricken people in the liberated areas, denouncing this heinous crime of the Chiang Kai-shek government and demanding that the people of the world provide support. If the UN Relief has the slightest intention of providing relief to the Chinese people, it should immediately fulfill its previous promises, stop transporting all relief supplies to the UNRRA, and withdraw all technical personnel and equipment participating in the Yellow River project. We have every right to demand that the UN Relief directly send the $220 million worth of relief supplies that have not yet been paid to China to the Chinese liberated areas to provide relief to the residents in the old Yellow River course who have been affected by the disaster and all other disaster-stricken people. As for the Chiang government's act of releasing water to drown the residents of the old Yellow River course, its crime is unforgivable, and we are willing to retain all rights and freedom to denounce this crime."

    董必武同志发表声明
    声讨蒋介石堵口罪行
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】中国解放区救济总会主任委员董必武，特就蒋政府违约实行黄河堵口事发表声明如下：
    “蒋介石政府于大举进攻延安的同时，为配合其在黄河故道南岸作战，竟不惜用黄河堵口的办法，企图淹死黄河故道及两岸居民数百万，以遂其军事上隔断我解放区的目的。蒋介石政府这一滔天罪行，已彻底撕毁历次黄河协议。本来历次协议均规定黄河堵口处的合龙必须俟故道复堤修险及救济难民的工作完成后，方得实施；而此三项工作的经费，应由蒋政府负责发给。乃此三项经费初步协议早成立于去年七月，然至今犹未发给一半。而蒋政府之进攻解放区，更使黄河故道两岸的复堤修险工程近十个月来已无法进行。行总、联总为参加黄河协议并保证此协议之实施的，但对蒋政府历次破坏黄河协议从未予以阻责；因是蒋政府遂敢悍然不顾一切，于三月十一日在花园口实行合龙。中国行总本为蒋介石独裁政府的工具，其进行救济善后工作之偏私、贪污与无能，举世早有定论。惟联总为世界性之组织，今竟亦违背其原则，不仅对解放区人民予以政治歧视，且坐视解放区数百万人民濒于死亡险境而不给以任何援助。我谨代表解放区受灾难的人民向全世界呼吁，声讨蒋介石政府这一滔天罪行，要求全世界人民予以声援。联总苟有丝毫救济中国人民之意，便应立践前言，停运一切救济物资给行总，并撤回一切参加黄河工程的技术人员及器材。我们有十足权利要求联总将救济中国尚未付出之两亿二千万美金的救济物资直接送给中国解放区，救济黄河故道被难的居民及其他一切受灾难的人民。至于蒋政府放水淹死黄河故道居民，已罪无可追，我们愿保有声讨此种罪行的一切权利和自由。”
