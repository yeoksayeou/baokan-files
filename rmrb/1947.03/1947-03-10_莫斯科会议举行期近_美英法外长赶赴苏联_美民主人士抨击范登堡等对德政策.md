　　Moscow Conference Imminent
    US, British, and French Foreign Ministers Head to the Soviet Union
    American Democrats Criticize Vandenberg's and Others' Policies Towards Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] Reports from various sources: Marshall, en route to Moscow, arrived in Paris on the morning of the 6th. Marshall's change of original plans to detour through the French capital was to exchange opinions with the French Premier on the German question. Marshall visited French Premier Ramadier and French President Auriol on the 6th for discussions. Bevin's special train passed through Poznan and Warsaw on the 6th, reaching the Soviet border that evening. Bidault arrived in Berlin at noon on the 6th and boarded a special train eastward at 7 PM that evening.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] As the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference approaches, American Democrats have voiced opinions advocating cooperation with the Soviet Union to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement and opposing the US pursuit of the foreign policies of Vandenberg and Dulles. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 5th: The Daily Worker reported that Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor, at the Michigan Democratic Party Convention, severely criticized the hostility shown by Republicans towards the Soviet Union and the absurd attempts to suppress the democratic rights of the American people. Taylor said that Americans "must cooperate with the Soviet Union and defeat the disastrous policy of quarreling with the Soviet Union—the policy advocated by the Republican Party." Taylor sharply criticized the American press for "trying to divide the American people from cooperation with the Soviet Union." Sadowski, in a speech in the House of Representatives, urged the United States to support Poland's legitimate claims to Silesia, Pomerania, and Brandenburg (note: all three provinces are in eastern Germany) at the upcoming Moscow conference, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Sadowski expressed opposition to the proposals by certain American congressmen and newspapers to return the aforementioned areas to Germany. He said, "It seems that some people are more interested in defending the status of Germany than in fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement." He continued, "For the sake of peace in Europe and the world, the reconstruction of Poland is more important than the 'revival' of Germany." The day before, Nixon, a representative of the UE (United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America) , declared at the US Foreign Trade Committee that the United States must abandon the illusion of simultaneously restricting loans to the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia for political reasons while also seeking to maximize international trade. He continued, if the United States supports the policies of Vandenberg and Dulles, namely rebuilding the German economy as a center of anti-Sovietism, then the United States will not be able to gain the trust of other countries at the international trade conference.

　　莫斯科会议举行期近
    美英法外长赶赴苏联美
    民主人士抨击范登堡等对德政策
    【新华社延安七日电】各方报导：马歇尔已于飞往莫斯科途中于六日晨抵巴黎。马氏之改变原定计划而绕道法国首都，是为了与法国首相对德国问题交换意见，马歇尔于六日先后拜访法总理拉马第与法总统奥勒尔有所商谈。贝文之专车已于六日白书驰过波京华沙，于当晚抵苏联边界。比道尔于六日午抵柏林，于当晚七时乘专车东开。
    【新华社延安七日电】美国民主人士在此莫斯科外长会议即将举行之际，纷纷发表意见主张与苏联合作履行波茨顿协议，反对美国执行范登堡、杜勒斯的外交政策。据塔斯社纽约五日讯：工人日报载称：爱达荷州民主党参议员泰勒在密执安州民主党大会上严斥共和党内部对苏联所表示的敌意，以及压制美国人民民主权利的荒谬企图。泰勒说：美国人“必须与苏联合作并击败与苏联争吵的灾难政策——共和党所拥护的政策”。泰勒尖锐批评美国报界，“竭力分裂美国人民与苏联之合作”。沙多夫斯基在众院发表演说，敦促美国在未来莫斯科会议中支持波兰对西里西亚、波美兰尼亚及勃兰登堡（按上述三省均在德国东部）的正当要求，以符合于波茨顿协议。沙氏对美国某些议员及报纸主张将上述各地交还德国一事，表示反对。他说：“似乎某些人对保卫德国地位比履行波茨顿协议更有兴趣”。继称：以欧洲及世界和平而言，重建波兰实比“复活”德国更为重要。在此前一日，产联无线电工人又有代表尼克松在美国对外贸易委员会宣称：美国必须放弃一方面以政治原因限制对苏波捷南等国贷款，另一方面却欲使国际贸易达到最高限度的幻想。继称：如果美国支持范登堡、杜勒斯的政策，即重建德国经济作为反苏的中心，则美国即不可能在国际贸易会议上获得其他国家的信仰。
