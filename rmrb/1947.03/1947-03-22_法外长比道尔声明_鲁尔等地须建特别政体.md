Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: A Moscow dispatch reports that the Foreign Ministers' Conference, chaired by Bevin on the 18th, continued to discuss the issues of economic principles and reparations in the German Control Council's report. French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a lengthy statement at the meeting.

Bidault stated that France fundamentally does not want Germany to be able to use its industrial resources and natural wealth to equip for war again. The French government believes that the Ruhr area, the Rhineland, and the Saar area must all establish special political entities. Bidault firmly advocated eliminating Germany's war potential. The total amount of German coal must be increased to the highest level, and it has the obligation to export a certain amount of its coal production to the Allied countries every month. The French delegation regards this as one of the basic terms in the treaty currently being discussed, and the total amount of coal left to Germany must be limited. Of the industries whose production must be permanently restricted, the steel industry comes first. The level of steel industry production should not greatly exceed the provisions of the Control Council in March 1946. The French government has never denied that Germany, within its current borders, must be an economic whole, and must wait for the determination of the status of the Ruhr area and the Rhineland. The only condition put forward by the French government is that the Saar area must be immediately included in the French economic and monetary system. Because the German border has not yet been clearly defined, France cannot agree to the immediate establishment of a German administrative organ, otherwise the future border of Germany would have to be predetermined. The French government believes that German economic unity can be respected within the scope of temporary institutions, and he suggests instructing the Assistant Foreign Ministers to submit a report on the interpretation of the "economic unity" clause.

When Bidault spoke about the issue of reparations, he pointed out that the transfer of industrial equipment, which has not been carried out at a sufficient speed, must be continued immediately. Bidault believes that the amount of industrial equipment handed over as reparations from the western occupied territories to date is still negligible. The French government believes that the issue of reparations should be the subject of further thorough review. Finally, Bidault read out the French delegation's recommendations on economic and reparations issues for the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    法外长比道尔声明
    鲁尔等地须建特别政体
    【新华社延安二十日电】莫斯科讯：十八日之外长会议由贝文任主席，继续讨论德国管委会报告中关于经济原则与赔偿之问题，法外长比道尔在会上发表长篇声明。比道尔声称：法国本愿德国再次能用其工业资源与自然财富来装备战争，法政府认为鲁尔区、莱茵区及萨尔区都必须建立特别政体。比道尔坚主消除德国的战争潜在力，德国煤炭的总量必须提升至最高度，且有义务每月将其一定的煤产量输出同盟国；法代表团视此为目前正在讨论的和约中的基本条款之一，留给德国的煤炭总量必须受到限制。工业中产量必须永久受着限制的，首先是钢铁工业，钢铁工业生产的水平不应大量超过一九四六年三月管委会的规定，法政府从不否认在德国目前的边界内德国为一经济整体而必须等待鲁尔区及莱茵区地位之确定。法政府所提出之唯一条件是萨尔区必须立即包括于法国经济与货币体系中。由于德国边界至今未曾明白规定，法国不可能同意立即成立德国行政机关，否则德国的未来边界就须预先决定。法政府认为可以在临时机构的范围内尊重德国的经济统一，他建议指令外长助理关于解释“经济统一”条款提出报告。比道尔谈及赔偿问题时，指出法政府要求至今尚未以相当速度进行移交之工业装备须立即继续进行。比道尔认为截至目前自西部占领区所交出作为赔偿之工业装备的数量，仍微不足道。法政府以为赔偿问题应成为进一步彻底审查的题目。最后比道尔朗读法代表团关于外长会议对经济与赔偿诸问题的建议。
