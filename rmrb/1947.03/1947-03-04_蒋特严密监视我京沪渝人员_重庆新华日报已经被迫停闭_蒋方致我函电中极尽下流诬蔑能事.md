Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. The Kuomintang authorities in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing sent letters and telegrams on the night of February 27th and 28th to the CCP Liaison Offices and Offices in these three cities, ordering CCP personnel to withdraw completely within four days (i.e., before March 5th). The letters were full of reversing right and wrong, venomous accusations, and extremely vulgar slander.

    The letter and telegram from the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters of the Kuomintang to the CCP Nanjing Liaison Office at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village stated: "To the CCP Nanjing Liaison Office and Delegation at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village: Since your party rejected peace talks and closed the door to peace, your party's troops have openly rebelled in various places, attacking the National Army everywhere, and your party's personnel are spreading rumors and inciting riots everywhere. In order to maintain local security, this Headquarters requests that all personnel of your office residing in Nanjing be withdrawn completely before March 5th of this year, and that a roster of the names, genders, ages, native places, and positions of the personnel currently in Nanjing be compiled immediately and sent to this Headquarters for escort out of the territory. This telegram is hereby sent for your information. Secretly printed by the Capital Garrison Headquarters, February 28th."

    Xuan Tie Wu of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters' letter of the 28th to the Shanghai office was particularly absurd. The original letter stated: "It has been found that the said party has rejected peace negotiations, created internal unrest, and incited unrest and organized riots in this city. In order to ensure security, this Headquarters hereby notifies the said party's personnel in Shanghai to withdraw completely before March 5th. A list of all withdrawing personnel and their families must be submitted to the Headquarters for verification before March 3rd."

    Sun Yuanliang of the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters sent a letter at 10:00 PM on the 27th to Wu Yuzhang, the CCP representative in Chongqing, ordering all CCP personnel and their families in Chongqing to withdraw from Chongqing before March 5th, and also ordering them to "cease all activities from 3:00 AM on February 28th and gather separately at No. 23 Zengjiayan and No. 76 Hualongqiao New Village in this city, where CCP personnel originally resided, and complete the gathering by 12:00 noon on the 28th." It also stated: "All radio stations, equipment, and materials of the CCP organ newspaper Xinhua Daily are requested to be inventoried separately and handed over for safekeeping by personnel dispatched by this Headquarters." The reasons given were: "Now that Chongqing is no longer the seat of the central government since the National Government returned to the capital, and there are no U.S. mediation personnel stationed here, nor is there any UNRRA headquarters; therefore, it is not necessary for CCP personnel to be stationed in Chongqing, and local security and order are often significantly affected as a result."

    The above three telegrams were all published in full by the Central News Agency on the 28th. As early as mid-last month, various signs had already proved that Chiang Kai-shek intended to detain CCP personnel stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing by various means. Chiang Kai-shek twice inquired through Ambassador Stuart and Pi Zongkan whether the CCP Nanjing Liaison Office would withdraw its liaison personnel from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. However, when CCP personnel inquired whether the government had decided that CCP personnel should withdraw, they both avoided answering. At the same time, the "February 5th" and "February 8th" incidents in Chongqing and the "February 9th" incident in Shanghai, as well as the fascist atrocities of the Chiang government's large-scale arrest of citizens in Beiping, Shenyang, and other places, have occurred successively. After the above-mentioned letters and telegrams ordering CCP personnel to withdraw were issued, CCP personnel stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing have been severely monitored by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. According to an Associated Press dispatch: "On the 28th, the Nanjing Communist Liaison Office was under heavy surveillance by special agents. When reporters from this agency went to the office to interview, these special agents did not even bother to hide. It is said that the Communist Party has stopped issuing communiqués after the police actually attempted to destroy the bicycles used by Communist couriers to deliver communiqués to the hotels occupied by reporters. A CCP spokesman said: A telegram from Chongqing stated that Xinhua Daily, the only Communist newspaper in the Chiang-controlled area, has been forced to cease publication by the Chiang government after nine years of publication. No arrests have yet been reported in Chongqing, but police are constantly questioning all visitors to the Communist office."

　　蒋特严密监视我京沪渝人员
    重庆新华日报已经被迫停闭
    蒋方致我函电中极尽下流诬蔑能事
    【新华社延安二日电】南京、上海、重庆国民党当局二月二十七日夜及二十八日分函该三地中共联络处及办事处，限中共人员于四天内（即在三月五日以前）全部撤退，函中极尽颠倒是非、含血喷人、下流诬蔑之能事。
    国民党南京卫戍司令部致中共南京联络处之函电称：“梅园新村十七号中共南京联络处及代表团公鉴：自贵党拒绝和谈关闭和平之门，贵党军队在各地公开叛乱，处处攻击国军，而贵党人员又在各处散播谣言，鼓动变乱，本部为维持地方治安，应请贵处将留居本京人员于本年三月五日前全部撤退，并将现在在京人员姓名、性别、年龄、籍贯、职务即速造册，并送本部，以便护送离境，特此电达，即希查照。首都卫戍司令部，二月二十八日秘印。”
    淞沪卫戍司令部宣铁吾二十八日致上海办事处之函中尤属荒谬，原函称：“查该党拒绝和平谈判，制造内乱，复在本市煽动风潮，组织暴动，本部为确保治安，兹特通知该党在沪人员，限于三月五日前全部撤退。所有撤退人员及其眷属限于三月三日前开具名单，送部核办。”
    重庆警备司令部孙元良则于二十七日夜间十时函达中共驻渝代表吴玉章，除限令中共在渝人员及其眷属于三月五日前一律撤离重庆外，并限“于二月二十八日上午三时起停止一切活动，分别集合于中共人员原住之本市曾家岩二十三号及化龙桥新村七十六号两处，限二十八日正午十二时集合完毕。”并称：“所有中共机关报新华日报之一切电台、机件、器材，希饬自行分别造册，由本司令派员点收，代为保管。”其所举理由为：“现时重庆地方自国民政府还都后，非已中央政府所在地，此间既未驻有美方调处人员，联总行总亦无机构；因此中共人员实无驻重庆之必要，且地方治安秩序每因此引起重大之影响。”
    上述三电均经中央社于二十八日全文发表，早在上月中旬各种迹象即已证明蒋介石企图以各种手段扣押中共驻京沪渝三地人员，蒋介石曾两次经由司徒大使及皮宗阚询问中共南京联络处是否撤退京沪渝三地联络人员。但当中共人员询以是否政府决定中共人员撤走时，则均避而不答。同时，重庆之“二、五”“二、八”及上海之“二、九”惨案与北平、沈阳等地蒋政府大肆逮捕市民之法西斯暴行，均先后发生。上述迫令中共人员撤离函电发出后，中共驻京沪渝人员均已遭受蒋介石特务之严重监视。据美联社电称：“二十八日南京共产党联络处已处于特务重重监视之下。当本社记者往该办事处采访消息时，这些特务连藏也不藏。据称：共产党在警察实际企图捣毁共产党通讯员送公报到记者们所占旅馆时乘坐之自行车后，已停止发出公报。中共发言人称：重庆来电，谓蒋管区的唯一共产党报纸新华日报出版九年之后，已被蒋政府强迫停刊。尚未悉重庆有逮捕事件，但警察不断盘查共产党办事处一切来往客人。”
