    Awakening and Liberation of Catholic Villagers in Zhao Family Ridge, Xiangyuan
    [Our Taihang News, 2nd] During a detailed inspection in the third district of Xiangyuan in the first month of the lunar calendar, it was discovered that feudal forces in Zhao Family Ridge, a natural village in Fawaling, had not been crushed, and the peasants had not been politically or ideologically liberated. All sixty households in the village were Catholics, and the peasants had particularly strong ideas about "conscience," "fate," and "going to heaven." During the two major movements last year, the struggles against a few landlords were handled by cadres from the administrative village and a few activists from other natural villages. The masses in this village were not awakened at all. Therefore, once the external forces left, feudal rulers such as Han Fangqiu and Zhao Deliang continued to use their positions in the church to rule the masses, gathering them for scripture reading even more frequently than before. Every time after scripture reading, they would threaten the masses, saying, "Catholics cannot rebel for liberation. Whoever rebels commits a sin and will not be able to go to heaven in the future. Catholicism is 'faith' and cannot be 'virtue.' Wealth is ordained by God." They also spread rumors, "The world is about to change! Everyone be careful!" As a result, the masses were very afraid and dared not plant the land they had been allocated; the furniture they had been allocated was still kept in the landlord's house; and those who had been allocated livestock thought they were just keeping it for the landlord. For example, the poor peasant Zhao Tianlin, who retrieved a mule from the landlord Yue He's house last spring, often told people, "As long as I have the mule, I can always stand up to him (referring to the landlord) in the future." During the rectification movement last winter, many peasants said, "We have already been thoroughly liberated." The village cadres also thought, "It's almost done." In the first month of the lunar calendar, district cadre Zhang Jie conducted a detailed inspection in the village and found that many peasants had not been liberated but were afraid to take the fruits of their labor. Through individual visits, he learned that the feudal rule in the village had not been crushed. He then sought out the poorest people, held small-scale forums, encouraged them to speak out about their sufferings, and asked, "Think carefully, are there any instances of people bullying others in the Catholic Church?" Zhao Dengwu, a hired laborer, said, "Speaking of suffering, I have plenty! In the past, we always felt that Catholics should not rebel for liberation. Last year, I didn't dare to take the fruits of my labor that were allocated to me." After a few days of deliberation, many people became aware and demanded a mass meeting to speak out about their sufferings. Comrade Zhang immediately supported them, saying, "Speak out with confidence; I will vouch for you." At the meeting, the masses spoke out about their sufferings enthusiastically. Zhao Gaiguo, a middle-aged woman, cried and said, "I am originally from Wuxiang. When I was young, my family was too poor to live. My parents heard that joining the church would lead to a better life, so they sold our poor home and brought us children to Zhao Family Ridge to join the church. My parents begged the priest for some food, but the priest not only refused to give it but also beat my mother. We were so hungry that my father went to beg again, and the priest gave us a bowl of leftover food that had been fed to the dogs, saying, 'Go quickly! Being in the church means enduring hardship.' But he ate pork and white flour. When I was twenty-two, I worked as a wet nurse for the landlord Ji Guanghe (also a Catholic). His family ate wine and spicy meat every day, while I often ate coarse rice and plain meals. We were both Catholics, why the different lives? Last year, the masses allocated me a new quilt, a few clothes, and five dou of wheat. This year's New Year is truly the first for me. This was given to me by Chairman Mao. The Catholic Church didn't give me anything. I don't believe in it anymore. I want to leave the church." Lin Xiang, a young woman who grew up in the convent, said, "There are some unfair things in the Catholic Church! The church rules prohibit marrying non-Catholics, but the big landlord Li Guanghe's wives and concubines are all non-Catholics, and the priest still congratulates him. When it comes to the poor, they talk about church rules. When Zhao Zhangquan got married, he had to go to the priest to go through the formalities (church rules), and he had to give four yuan, forcing him to borrow from everywhere to get through. The poor's wedding dates are designated by the priest, but the landlords are free to choose. What's the use of being in the church in the old society?! Money and power make you powerful." After their speeches, the masses at the meeting said, "Believing in religion should be up to oneself. Feudal rule must be overthrown. Han Fangqiu and Zhao Deliang should not manage church affairs in the future." Through the meeting, the masses' awareness was greatly improved. Zhao Dengwu, the hired laborer who dared not take the fruits of his labor, dared to claim his land. Sixty-two men and women voluntarily left the church. Those who remained in the church democratically elected a Catholic Management Committee to manage themselves. The peasant association was also re-established, with forty members (including those in and out of the church). The fruits of labor have been distributed. Now, district and village cadres are concentrating their efforts on conducting systematic ideological education for the masses.

　　“信天主能好活是假的  靠毛主席翻身是真的”
    襄垣赵家岭教民觉悟翻身
    【本报太行二日电】襄垣三区，旧历正月进行细致检查，发化岩岭自然村赵家岭，封建势力仍未打垮，农民政治上思想上均仍未翻身。该村六十户全是天主教徒，农民“良心”、“命运”、“升天堂”思想特别浓厚。去年二次大运动，斗了几户地主，都是行政村干部与其他自然村少数积极分子所包办，本村群众根本未觉悟起来，所以外力一走，封建统治者韩芳秋、赵德良等，仍然利用其在教内的地位统治群众，召集群众念经比过去更紧，每逢念经后，即威胁群众说：“天主教人不能闹翻身，谁闹谁就犯罪，将来就不能升天堂，天主教是‘信德’不能‘见德’，家富是天主造定的。”并大肆造谣：“天快变呀！大家小心些”！因此，群众十分害怕，分上土地不敢种；分的家具仍然放在地主家；分上牲口的，思想上也都是给地主保存；如贫农赵天林，去春在地主月和家收回一个骡，他经常给人说：“只要有骡在，将来总能顶住他（指地主）。”去冬填补运动中，许多农民说：“俺们已翻透身啦”。村干部也认为“差不多了”。旧历正月初，区干部张杰，到该村进行细致检查，发现许多农民并未翻身，但不敢要果实。经个别访问，才知该村封建统治仍未打垮；遂即找寻最穷苦者，进行小型座谈，启发诉苦，提出：“大家好好想想，天主教里有没有人欺侮人的事情”。雇工赵登五说：“说痛苦，我可多哩！过去咱总觉得在教（天主教）人不应该闹翻身，去年给我分果实就没敢要。”经过几天酝酿，不少群众觉悟起来了，要求开大会诉苦，张同志即给大家撑腰说：“放心诉吧；我给大家作主”。大会开了，群众诉苦十分踊跃，中年妇女赵改果痛哭流涕的说：“俺原是武乡人，小时、家穷无法生活，俺父母听人说，入了教即能好活，即把穷家拍卖，带上孩子们来到赵家岭入了教，俺父母央求神甫给些粮食吃，神甫不但不给，还打了俺母亲一顿，俺们饿的实在没有办法了，父亲又去央求，神甫才把喂狗剩下的饭，给了一碗，并说：“快去！在教就得刻苦。”可是他却吃的是猪肉白面。俺二十二岁时，给地主季广和（也是天主教）当奶妈，他家人每天吃酒辣肉，俺常吃的是粗米淡饭，都是天主教、为甚两样生活，去年群众给俺分了一条新被，几件衣服，五斗麦子，今年过年真是这辈头一个年，这是毛主席给俺的，天主教并没给俺什么，俺不信它了，俺愿意退出教。”在修女院长大的青年妇女林香说：“天主教里。可有些不公道事情哩！教规不准娶外教（指天主教以外的人）女人，但大地主李广和娶的大小老婆都是外教人，神甫还给人家贺禧。轮到穷人就要讲教规，赵掌权结婚时，事前去神甫那里办理手续（教规）非给四块钱不行，逼得他东揭西借，才算闹通。穷人结婚由神父指定日期，地主们却可自由。旧社会里在教顶什事？！有钱有势就厉害。”他俩发言后，会场群众都说：“信教应当由自己，封建统治要打倒，韩芳秋、赵德良以后不能管教事”。经过大会，群众觉悟大大提高，最不敢要果实的雇工赵登五，也敢要土地了，自动退出教的男女群众即有六十二人。在教的也民主选出天主教管理委员会，自己管理自己。农会也重新建立，有会员四十人（在教与出教者均有）。果实已经分配完毕，现区村干正集中力量对群众进行系统思想教育。
