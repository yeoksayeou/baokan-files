　　【This dispatch from the Jilu豫 [transliteration: Ji-Lu-Yu] region, dated the 10th, reports that】 Since the Fourth Prefectural Committee and the Political Department of the Fourth Military Subdistrict instructed the troops to participate in the mass movement, the Changqing Independent Battalion, the Armed Work Team, and the district teams in the border areas have all been投入 [transliteration: tóu rù - committed] to land reform, quickly opening up the situation. Cadres from the Independent Battalion led armed forces to the area north of the Third District and north of the Shahe River in the Second District, resolutely supporting the mass struggle. In the northern part of the Third District, they cooperated with local cadres to convene a meeting of over a thousand activists. Soldiers provided cover for the masses to hold meetings and divide the spoils [果实: guǒshí - here referring to land and resources seized from landlords], resulting in extremely high morale. The troops working in the Shahe area of the Second District first convened a meeting of military personnel to convey the land reform policy. They also mobilized soldiers by company to trace their class roots, enhance their class consciousness, provide cover for the mass struggle, and support the masses. They also convened mass meetings and landlord meetings everywhere to宣传 [xuān chuán - disseminate propaganda about] land reform. At present, a vigorous land-to-the-tiller movement has unfolded in ten large villages in northern Changqing.

　　长清地方武装支援土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】自四地委及四分区政治部指示部队参加群众运动后，长清独立营武工队及边沿区区队全部投入土地改革，很快的打开了局面。独立营干部分头率领武装到三区以北及二区沙河以北活动，坚决支持群众斗争。在三区北配合地方干部召开千余人的积极分子大会，战士掩护群众开会分果实，情绪极高。在二区沙河工作的部队，他们首先召开军人大会传达土地改革政策，并以连为单位发动战士追穷根，提高阶级觉悟，掩护群众斗争，给群众撑腰，并到处召开群众大会房东会，宣传土地改革。现长清北部十个大村已轰轰烈烈的展开了土地回家运动。
