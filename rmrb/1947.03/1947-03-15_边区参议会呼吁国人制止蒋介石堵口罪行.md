　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, representing the 30 million people of the entire region, has called on people from all walks of life across the country to rise up urgently and stop Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of inundating our liberated areas by breaching the dikes. The original telegram is as follows:
    To all newspaper offices, organizations, and elders and compatriots across the country:
    This Assembly, representing the 30 million people of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, is making a complaint to you, appealing to you, and requesting that you immediately extend your hands of justice and friendship to stop Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crime of flooding the liberated areas and to rescue the seven million compatriots on both banks of the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan!
    The people of our region have been working tirelessly for a year on the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course. What we seek is to take into consideration the interests of both the residents of the new flooded area and the old river channel; what we are striving for is to reduce the downstream disasters, and that dike breaching and levee restoration must be carried out in coordination. Anyone with a bit of fairness should approve of this aim. Last summer, in the scorching sun and heavy rain, we mobilized 2.33 million people and restored 1,426 *li* of levees, which is sufficient to demonstrate our consistent words and deeds and our sincere efforts to cooperate. Unexpectedly, the brutal ones cannot be moved by goodwill; the more we endure, the more狂they become. Now, the lives and property of seven million compatriots are on the verge of being swallowed by the Yellow River!
    Over the past year, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary partisans have been determined to inundate the liberated areas: at first, they only breached the dikes and did not care about restoring the levees. Then, they pretended to agree to an agreement but then tore it up, actively breaching the dikes and delaying the restoration of the levees, and condoning special agents to harass our levee restoration personnel and work. After last autumn, on the one hand, they sent large armies to invade and loot the river management funds, and on the other hand, they delayed the payment of construction funds and resettlement relief funds, forcing us to carry out work with difficulty. On the other hand, they actively coordinated with military operations, intensified the breaching of the dikes, the closing of the gap, and the excavation of diversion channels, so that if "God had not been uncooperative" and the dike breaching project had not been washed away twice, the downstream disasters would have been indescribable. At the end of last year, they arbitrarily breached the dikes and released water in violation of the agreement, causing heavy losses to the residents near the river who had not had time to evacuate. However, the traitorous civil war elements still thought it was not enough. Since February this year, they have sent American-style airplanes every day to bomb and strafe the employees, equipment, civilian ships, and residents on both banks of the river who were engaged in rescue operations, causing countless deaths and injuries and unspeakable misery! This made it impossible to carry out rescue operations, and we could only feel indignant! The Chiang army also dug up the newly built dikes everywhere, fearing that the river would not breach quickly enough. Recently, we learned from a Central News Agency broadcast on March 6 that the Huayuankou closure project has begun and will be fully completed before March 20, and that a diversion channel has been excavated and completed, and that half of the water will be released into the old channel on the 8th. The ruthlessness of the reactionaries has reached its extreme! Completely disregarding the promise in the Shanghai agreement in mid-February that "the date of the closure will be decided by the Water Resources Committee, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Executive Relief Administration, and the Liberated Area after consultation based on the actual needs of the project in mid-March," in order to achieve their conspiracy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war, they attempted to use water to reverse the decline of their human army, and took this poisonous step, disregarding the lives of millions of people. Can the elders and compatriots of the country bear to sit idly by? In addition to risking our lives to carry out rescue and self-help, the people of our region respectfully submit a petition and pray for your help. We are extremely eager and look forward to it!
            The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly bows in respect.          March 12th

　　边区参议会呼吁国人制止蒋介石堵口罪行
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会为蒋介石政府悍然决定堵口放水淹我解放区，顷代表全区三千万人民，呼吁全国各界父老同胞急起制止蒋介石此种罪行，原电如下：
    全国各报馆各团体暨各界父老同胞公鉴：
    本会代表晋冀鲁豫解放区三千万人民向你们控诉，向你们呼吁，请求你们即刻伸出正义友爱之手，制止蒋介石水淹解放区之滔天罪行，援救冀鲁豫黄河两岸七百万同胞！
    本区人民为黄河归故问题而骇汗奔走者已一年矣。所求者对新泛区与旧河道居民利益兼筹并顾；所争者稍减下游灾害，堵口与复堤必须配合进行。稍持公道者，当韪斯旨。去夏烈日霖雨中我动工二百三十三万，复堤千四百二十六里，足见言行一致竭诚合作之努力。不谓残暴者非善意所能感化，我愈忍而彼愈狂。今七百万同胞之生命财产已濒黄水吞没之危境矣！
    一年来蒋介石及其反动党徒决心淹没解放区：初则只堵口而不管复堤。继则假计协议旋即撕毁，积极堵口耽延复堤，并纵容特务扰害我之复堤人员与工作。去秋以后，一面以大军进犯抢劫治河资财一空，一面拖付工款及移民救济费，迫我困难进行工作，另一面则积极配合军事行动，加紧堵口合龙及挖引河工事，使非“天公不作美”，堵口工程两次被冲，则下游两岸灾害早不知伊于胡底矣。去年年底擅自违约放水，河身居民不及迁避者损失至重。而卖国内战分子犹以为未足，今年二月以来大派美式飞机逐日轮番轰炸扫射抢险之员工器材民船与两岸居民，死伤累累，凄惨难言。致使抢险无从，空自愤悒！蒋军并又到处挖掘新筑之堤，惟恐河决之不速。顷又获中央社三月六日广播：花园口合龙工程已开始，三月二十日前可全部完成，加挖引河一条已竣工，八日即放一半水流入旧道云云。反动派之狠毒于斯已极！完全无视二月中旬上海协议“合龙日期至三月中旬视工程实际需要再由水委会、联总、行总及解放区四方面会商决定”之诺言，为遂其卖国独裁内战之阴谋，企图以水军换回其人军之颓势，下此毒手，忍置数百万生灵于不顾，全国父老其忍坐视欤？本区人民除冒万死抢险自救外，敬谨代表陈情，祈予赐助，不胜迫切翘企之至！
            晋冀鲁豫边区参议会叩          三月十二日
