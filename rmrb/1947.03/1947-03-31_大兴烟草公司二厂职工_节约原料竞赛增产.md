    Daxing Tobacco Company No. 2 Factory Workers
    Saving Raw Materials and Increasing Production Through Competition
    [Our Newspaper] Since Daxing Tobacco Company's No. 2 Factory launched the "February 7th" competition, especially since challenging the No. 1 Branch of the Military Industry Department, it has achieved results in both production and savings. The output of the machine rolling team has increased from 16,000 packs per day to 23,000 packs. No. 1 machine dramatically increased from 4,000 packs per day to 6,880 packs. The packaging team increased from packaging 15,000 packs of cigarettes per day to 22,000 packs (average). Worker Ren Daming increased his daily output from 900 packs to 1,500 packs, and new apprentice Wang Zengxian leaped from 400 packs to 810 packs, more than doubling his output. The achievements in saving are even greater. The waste tobacco shreds (scattered on the ground and contaminated with soil) of the machine rolling team decreased from more than 200 catties per day to zero, completely eliminated. Waste bobbin paper (a more expensive material) decreased from 1 catty and 11 taels per day to 1 catty and 2 taels, a reduction of one-third. In terms of saving labor, the entire factory reduced the number of odd-job workers by 8%, but the output continued to increase. The packaging department completely overcame issues such as dropping cigarettes, dropping tax stamps, and mislabeling packs during the competition. During the competition, workers enthusiastically launched a labor contribution movement. Out of 145 workers in the factory, 75 registered to contribute labor, contributing a total of more than 600 workdays (calculated only up to May 1st; a large portion was dedicated to defeating Chiang Kai-shek and could not be calculated). The consumption of office supplies by cadres decreased by 64.6% in January. The daily firewood consumption decreased from 600 catties to 300 catties. The machine rolling team proposed "completing 25,000 packs per day" (the standard output is 20,480 packs), but the output surged to 29,500 packs in one day. The packaging team increased the standard output by 50 packs per day, and the hand-rolling team also increased it by 25 packs. By implementing self-adhesive patching of packaging paper, the number of discarded paper sheets was reduced from 600 per day to 18, achieving significant savings. The carpentry and ironworking teams also joined the movement. The carpentry team has increased its daily production of boxes from three to more than five. The ironworking team didn't even have drills for continuous ironworking at first. Seeing other teams actively increasing production, they were so anxious that they used railway tracks instead of drills to make 15 tools such as pliers and hammers. The batching team, lacking standard output, proposed not to take sick leave, not to take days off except for regular holidays, and not to request leave for personal reasons. All cadres enthusiastically launched a "contribution points" movement. In just half a day, all 18 cadres contributed a total of 76 points, equivalent to approximately 5,652 catties of millet per year, until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. Miscellaneous personnel also contributed points (from their wages). All factory workers are working hard to strive for a model factory. (Zhiping)

    [Our Newspaper] In response to the call to defend Chairman Mao and support the front lines, the cadres of Daxing Tobacco Company launched an enthusiastic savings and donation movement. Model worker Wang Cheng donated 10,000 yuan and pledged to contribute five points per month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. Comrade Niu Tianlin, an accountant from the business department, pledged to contribute ten points per month. Stableman Dou Fuhe also volunteered to donate two months' wages. A total of 31 people donated 1,007 points (statistics as of the end of the year), equivalent to more than 300,000 yuan at market prices. All personnel unanimously expressed: "We will not stop contributing points until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated." (Note: "Points" are the term for cadre salaries, each point including rice, wheat, cloth, etc., equivalent to 320 yuan per point at current market prices). (Chenguang)

    节约原料竞赛增产
    【本报讯】大兴烟草公司第二厂，自开展“二七”竞赛特别是向军工处一分厂应战以来，生产节约均获成绩。机卷组产量由每日一万六千包增至二万三千包。一号机器从日产四千包，剧增到六千八百八十包。包装组由每日包烟一万五千包提高到二万二千包（平均数），成工任大明由日产九百包提到一千五百包，新学徒王增先由四百包猛进到八百一十包，提高了一倍以上。节约方面成绩更大，机卷组之糟烟丝（散落地下渗了土的丝）由每天由二百余斤直至完全消灭到一斤也没有，废料盘纸（较贵的一种材料）由每日一斤十一两减到一斤二两，减去三分之一。在节省劳力上，全厂减去杂工百分之八，但产量则不断提高。包装部掉烟、掉税花、错包皮等，在竞赛中完全克服。在竞赛中，工人们热烈的掀起了献工运动，全厂共一百四十五人，报名献工者达七十五名，共献工六百余天（按只截至五一为止的计算数，有大部分是献到打垮蒋介石为止的则无法计算）。干部办公用品一月中百分之六十四点灶每日烧柴由六百斤减至三百斤，机卷组提出了“完成每日二万五千包”（按标准产量为二万零四百八十包），但产量上曾猛涨到一日二万九千五百包。包装组通过每日增加标准产量五十包，手卷组也提高二十五包。实行自粘补包皮纸，得到了由每天六百张的废皮减到十八张的节约成绩。木工组、铁工组也卷入运动，木工组现已由每日做箱子三个增到五个多，铁工组新设连打铁的钻子也没有，眼看着别组积极增产，急得他们用道轨代替钻子，打了大小钳子、锤子等工具十五件。配料组无标准产量，提出不请事假，不过例假，不告病假等。全体干部热烈的掀起了献分运动，仅在半天内全体干部十八名共献分七十六个，约合每年献小米五千六百五十二斤，直到打败蒋介石为止。杂务人员也纷纷献分（工资）。全厂职工正为争取模范工厂而努力。          （志平）
