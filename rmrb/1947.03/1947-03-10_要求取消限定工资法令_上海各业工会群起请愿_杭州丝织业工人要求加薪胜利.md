Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai - Workers in various industries in Shanghai launched a movement at the end of last month demanding the lifting of the cost of living index freeze to protest against Chiang Kai-shek's "Economic Emergency Measures" attack on the labor community. The plan stipulates that wages must be paid according to the official cost of living index in January, but prices in February have risen more than double compared to January, and the average monthly price index has also increased by more than 60%. The announcement of this plan aroused widespread dissatisfaction among workers in various industries in Shanghai. On the 21st of last month, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, and decided to accept the demands of various industrial trade unions to petition the authorities for a lifting of the freeze. In addition to the Municipal Federation, the Postal Workers' Union, the Third, Fourth, and Sixth District Machine Industry Unions, as well as the Insurance, Department Store, Silk Weaving, Electricity, Chemical, Rubber, and Copper Refining Unions, and more than ten other units, also sent representatives to petition the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Government. Postal worker representatives also went to Nanjing to petition on the 23rd. The Fourth District Machine Industry Union issued a declaration on the 25th stating: "Freezing the cost of living index on which our hardworking employees depend for their livelihood by means of controlling wages is a fatal blow to us, no less than putting our families, old and young, to death." In order to demand the lifting of the index freeze, the Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions are preparing a joint petition. Postal worker representatives also stated that if the demand for lifting the freeze is rejected, postal workers will hold a general strike. Due to the powerful resistance of the workers, the Chiang government was forced to agree to revise the Shanghai wage payment standard, in addition to the January index, an additional subsidy of 73,000 yuan equivalent to the average increase in February for six commodities including rice, coal, cloth, oil, salt, and sugar will be paid. However, after the announcement of this subsidy method, workers in various industries still demanded the lifting of the freeze. Workers pointed out: "The above method is limited to Shanghai, and workers in other places still cannot live. Moreover, there are 58 essential items in the cost of living index standard, but the subsidy now only covers six, and the workers are still at a disadvantage." Some manufacturers stated that since the factory is still responsible for the differential subsidy, the product cost still increases at any time, so it is better to simply lift the cost of living index freeze to avoid additional trouble.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Hangzhou - The Hangzhou silk weaving workers' strike has ended victoriously. Since the promulgation of Chiang Kai-shek's Economic Emergency Measures, thousands of silk weaving workers in Hangzhou, feeling their livelihoods threatened, launched a general strike on the 21st of last month. Prior to this, silk weaving worker representatives had requested the capitalists to pay wages according to the February price index, but this broke down due to the capitalists' refusal. After the strike lasted for two days, the capitalists agreed to revise the wage payment standard to 64% more than the January cost of living. The workers won a victory and resumed work on the 23rd.

　　要求取消限定工资法令
    上海各业工会群起请愿
    杭州丝织业工人要求加薪胜利
    【新华社延安九日电】沪讯：上海各业工人于上月下旬发动要求生活指数解冻运动以抗议蒋介石“经济紧急措施方案”对劳工界之进攻。该方案规定发给工资须按照一月份的官定生活指数，但二月份物价较一月份已涨一倍以上，全月平均物价指数亦已高出百分之六十以上。此一方案公布后，引起沪市各业工人普遍不满，上月二十一日市总工会召开理监事紧急会议，决定接受各业工会要求向当局请愿解冻。除市总外，邮务总工会，第三、第四、第六等区机器产业工会，保险业、百货业、丝织业、电力业、化学业、橡胶业、炼铜业工会等十余单位，亦纷推代表向蒋记市政府请愿。邮工代表并于二十三日赴京请愿，四区机制产业工会在二十五日发表宣言称：“用统治工资的办法来冻结我们劳苦的职工借以为生的生活指数，这是给我们的致命打击，不啻置我们一家老小于死地”。为要求指数解冻，沪市各业工会筹备联合大请愿，邮工代表并表示如解冻要求被拒绝，则邮工将举行全体罢工。由于工人的强有力的抗争，蒋政府被迫答应修改沪市发给工资标准，除照一月份指数外复发给与米、煤、布、油、盐、糖六种商品二月份平均上涨数相当的七万三千元津贴。但此项津贴办法公布后，各业工人仍要求解冻，工人们指出：“上项办法只限上海一地，各地职工依然无法生活，且生活指数订制标准中必须品有五十八种，今津贴仅六种，工人仍然吃亏”。若干厂商则表示既然差额补贴仍由厂方负担，产品成本还是随时增加，则不如干脆将生活指数解冻，以免多一层麻烦。
    【新华社延安七日电】杭州讯：杭州丝织工人罢工已胜利结束。自蒋介石的经济紧急措施方案颁布后，杭州丝织工人数千余人，以生活感受威胁，于上月二十一日起发动总罢工。在此以前丝织工人代表曾向资方要求按照二月份物价指数发给工资，但因资方拒绝，致陷破裂。罢工持续两天后，资方已答应修改发给工资标准数照一月份生活数再加百分之六十四，工人获得胜利，遂于二十三日起复工。
