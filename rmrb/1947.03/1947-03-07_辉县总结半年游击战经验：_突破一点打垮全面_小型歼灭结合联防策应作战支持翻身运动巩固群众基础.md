　　Huixian Summarizes Six Months of Guerrilla Warfare Experience:
    Breaking Through at One Point to Defeat the Whole Area
    Small-Scale Annihilation Combined with Joint Defense and Support Operations to Support the Emancipation Movement and Consolidate the Mass Base
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The vigorous development of guerrilla warfare in Huixian over the past six months (from the end of last autumn to the beginning of this year) has created amazing results and rich experience. The county headquarters has made a systematic summary of the organization and leadership of guerrilla warfare, tactics, the combination of armed struggle and mass emancipation, and so on. The summary first made a correct assessment of the guerrilla warfare in the past six months: We have turned from passive to active, turning some stubborn-occupied areas into guerrilla areas, and guerrilla areas into core areas. The eastern front has generally advanced 20 li along a line of more than 100 li (except for individual villages). Now the county has controlled 365 administrative villages, and more than 200 villages can launch mass movements, increasing the population by more than 80,000 (plus villages in the stubborn-occupied areas that can be contacted, a total of about 100,000). More than 100 guns were seized, 45 enemies were captured, and 30 enemies were wounded (excluding the gains of the main regiment). We have smashed three major enemy offensives, defeated the enemy's conspiracy to organize "Joint Village Associations" and conscript soldiers, and resolutely defended the interests of the masses. The second part summarizes several major experiences in guerrilla warfare: (1) The main target of mass guerrilla warfare should be the "Home-Returning Corps," because these targets directly control special agent forces, conscript soldiers, and grab grain, which the masses hate to the bone. (2) Mass guerrilla warfare must have the participation of the broad masses. For example, the self-defense forces of many villages in the Third District used hand grenades to repel the "Home-Returning Corps," and Guo Xing (a first-class anti-enemy hero in Taihang) was able to move freely to and from the enemy's rear, all thanks to the support of the masses and their active participation in this war. (3) The issue of organizing and leading guerrilla warfare. In the past, the joint defense between villages and districts played a significant role. Recently, there have been new developments, such as the widespread use of old weapons by village self-defense forces, the construction of fortifications in villages, the transformation of terrain, and the organization of village battles, making joint defense more substantial and effective. The ideological leadership of the armed work teams and district cadre teams should be strengthened, and key personnel should be cultivated. Ideological leadership should be relaxed. Whether it is work or combat, everyone should be allowed to discuss and contribute ideas, so that the wisdom of the masses can be truly brought into play. The relationship between the armed work teams, district cadre teams, and militia should be such that the team members have good discipline, can support the militia, and the distribution of spoils of war should take care of the militia, and they should conduct unified guard duty and coordinated actions with the militia. If these are achieved, the relationship between the troops and the militia will be close. (4) Regarding guerrilla tactics. We must ensure that we do not strike unless we are sure, and when we strike, we must not fail (referring to taking the initiative). Breaking through at one point and defeating the whole area is the only way to shock the enemy, boost the morale of the masses and soldiers, and raise fighting spirit. The activities of each period must have a focus and a center, and organize and promote the climax of the movement, attacking the "Joint Village Associations" while attacking the enemy's conscription, so that armed struggle and political struggle are combined. Small-scale annihilation and small-scale capture are combined with joint defense and support operations. Offensively, use small-scale capture more often, and defensively, use joint defense operations more often. Tactics should be diverse and flexible, such as if the enemy ambushes us, we will "use ambush to counter-ambush," which has achieved victory. (5) Combining armed struggle with the emancipation struggle. Our patriotic self-defense war is a people's war. Only when the masses are thoroughly emancipated can they more effectively support this war and participate in this war. The mass emancipation movement in the border areas must be combined with armed struggle. In Huixian, there are the following three forms: A. District cadres and militia actively engage in armed activities to protect the emancipation interests of the masses. B. Arming on one hand and struggling on the other hand, further establishing the idea of the masses mastering weapons, expanding armaments, and strengthening armed struggle in the struggle. C. Transforming the armed work team into an emancipation team, leading the masses in struggle on one hand and engaging in armed activities on the other hand, with activities supporting the struggle.
    The conclusion of the summary pointed out that cadres in the border areas should always have three sets of ideological preparations: preparing to actively attack the enemy; preparing to defeat small-scale enemy attacks; and preparing to repel joint "sweep" offensives by the enemy.

　　辉县总结半年游击战经验：
    突破一点打垮全面
    小型歼灭结合联防策应作战支持翻身运动巩固群众基础
    【本报特讯】辉县半年来（去年秋末至今年初）游击战争的猛烈开展，创造了惊人的战果与丰富的经验，县指挥部对游击战争的组织领导、战术、武装斗争与群众翻身相结合等，都作了系统的总结。总结中首先对半年来的游击战争做了正确的估价：我们已变被动为主动，把部分的顽占区变为游击区，游击区变为腹心区，东线在百余里的线上普遍向前推进二十里（除个别村子外），现在全县已控制三百六十五个行政村，并且二百多个村能发动群众运动，增加人口八万多，（连能接头的顽占区村庄共约十万余），缴枪一百余支，俘敌四十五人，伤敌三十名，（基干团毙俘缴获在外）。曾粉碎敌人三次大进攻，打垮了敌人组织“联庄会”、抓丁等阴谋，坚决保卫了群众利益。第二部分，总结了游击战争中的几个主要经验：（１）群众游击战争打击的主要对象应是“还乡团”，因为这些对象直接掌握了特务武装，抓丁、抢粮，群众恨之入骨。（２）群众性的游击战争必须有广大群众参加。如三区许多村自卫队以手榴弹打退了“还乡团”，郭兴（太行一等杀敌英雄）能从敌后往来自如，都是由于群众拥护，并积极参加这一战争的结果。（３）游击战争的组织领导问题。过去村与村、区与区的联防起了很大的作用，最近又有新的发展，如各村自卫队普遍使用旧武器，在村中修筑工事、改造地形、组织村落战等，使联防更加充实有力。对武工队、区干队要加强思想领导，并培养骨干。思想领导要放手，不论工作与作战，都要让大家讨论，大家出主意，这样才能真正发挥群众的智慧。武工队、区干队与民兵的关系，要做到队员纪律好，能给民兵撑腰，分配战利品要照顾民兵，与民兵统一警戒、配合行动。作到这些，部队与民兵关系就会密切。（４）关于游击战术问题。要做到不打则已，要打就不落空（指主动出击），突破一点，打垮全面，只有这样才能震惊敌胆，振奋群众与战士情绪，提高斗志。每个时期的活动要有重点、有中心，并组织推动运动的高潮，打击“联庄会”同时打击敌人抓丁，使武装斗争与政治斗争结合起来。小型歼灭、小型捕捉结合联防策应作战。进攻多用小型捕捉，防范敌人多用联防作战。战术要多样灵活，如敌人打我们埋伏，我们则“以伏击反伏击”，取得了胜利。（５）武装斗争与翻身斗争相结合。我们进行爱国自卫战争是人民战争，只有群众彻底翻身后，才能更加有力支援这个战争，与参加这个战争。边沿区的群众翻身运动，必须结合武装斗争。在辉县有以下三种形式：甲、区干部、民兵积极武装活动，保卫群众翻身利益。乙、一面武装、一面斗争，在斗争中进一步树立群众掌握武装思想，扩大武装，加强武装斗争。丙、变武工队为翻身队，一面领导群众斗争，一面武装活动，活动即又给斗争撑了腰。
    总结的结尾指出，边地干部时常要有三套思想准备：准备积极进攻敌人；准备打垮敌人的小股袭击；准备打退敌人联合性的“扫荡”进攻。
