　　Handan International Peace Hospital
    Launches Spinning Craze
    Family Member Sister-in-law Gong Has Already Spun Three Jin of First-Class Yarn
    [This Newspaper's Report] Since March 1st, all comrades at Handan International Peace Hospital have launched a production craze centered on spinning. Every evening after dinner, for three hours, more than twenty spinning wheels turn together. Director Zhu also bought a new spinning wheel and squeezes in time to spin cotton. In the past ten days, everyone has spun a total of fourteen or fifteen jin of yarn. Family member Sister-in-law Gong has already spun three jin of first-class yarn and plans to immediately start spinning three jin of plied yarn. Because spinning has no seasonality, has wide sales channels, and is easy to learn, many comrades are requesting to spin; however, there is a lack of spinning wheels. The engineering staff Yang Qiulin, Wang Haishan, and others have started making spinning wheels themselves. The secretariat arranged wood in the courtyard. Secretary Huang Yutian, based on mechanical principles, created a double-wheeled spinning wheel. Each turn of the handle rotates the spindle one hundred and seventy times, exceeding the speed of earthen spinning wheels by more than three times. Family member Sister-in-law Liu and others are imitating it. In addition, there are mutual aid groups for making tofu, sprouting soybeans, etc. They freely combine into production groups based on the principle of not hindering work and the interests of the masses, and carry out production.

　　邯郸国际和平医院
    展开纺织热潮
    家属巩大嫂已纺头等纱三斤
    【本报讯】邯郸国际和平医院全体同志，自三月一日起掀起了以纺纱为主的生产热潮。每晚饭后三小时内，二十几辆纺车一齐转动，朱院长也买新纺车一辆，挤时间纺花。十天以来，全体共纺纱十四、五斤。家属巩大嫂已纺头等纱三斤，计划立即开始纺三斤合股线。因纺纱无季节性，销路广又易学，不少同志都要求纺；但纺车缺乏，工务员杨秋林、王海山等都自己做起纱车来。秘书处院内木材排列，秘书黄宇田同志并依据机械原理、创造了一辆双轮纺车，把手每搅一周，锭转一百七十次，超越土纺车速度三倍以上，家属刘大嫂等正照样仿制中。此外，尚有做豆腐、生豆芽等等互助组。他们根据不妨碍工作和群众利益的原则，自由结合生产小组，进行生产。
