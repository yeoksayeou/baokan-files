Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, March 18th: According to recent Central News Agency reports: The Kuomintang Control Yuan's report on the gold rush in the Chiang-controlled areas in mid-February proves that Chiang's court's "national bank," the Central Bank, was the direct instigator of this gold rush. The report reveals that the Central Bank "colluded with merchants for profit, creating this gold price fluctuation under extremely favorable conditions." "The Central Bank deliberately followed the black market and even seemed to be catching up to lead the black market." "On February 8th and 9th, the Central Bank suddenly suspended the allocation and sale of gold, causing the gold price to skyrocket," which was the direct cause of this gold rush. The report exposes various facts of collusion between Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank, and Zhan Liansheng, a major speculative merchant and black market gold dealer in Shanghai, to manipulate gold trading, stating that since the Central Bank implemented gold trading on March 8th last year, the buying and selling "methods and procedures have never been clearly defined, but are determined solely by personal relationships." "Only English reports are made to Song Ziwen personally every day, and all explicit sales and secret allocations of amounts and prices are determined solely by Bei Zuyi and Zhan Liansheng's 'telephone conversations.' The distribution and allocation of Central Bank gold bars are all handled by Zhan Liansheng. The five gold shops designated by the Central Bank to act as distributors are all controlled by Zhan. According to investigations, in the one month from January 4th to February 9th this year alone, the Central Bank entrusted the five gold shops to distribute 792,820 taels of gold, of which Tongfengyu Gold Shop, directly under Zhan, handled the distribution of 435,970 taels. The Central Bank, in fact, supplied Zhan Liansheng with all the details of gold sales and all the secrets of the Kuomintang's gold 'policy.' Zhan knew the total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank in the past year. Half an hour before the Central Bank stopped selling gold on February 9th, Zhan took the opportunity to purchase a large amount of gold in order to hoard and manipulate it. The report states that Wang Songtao, the assistant manager of the Central Bank in charge of gold vault accounts, also engaged in gold trading activities. The report also reveals the fact that senior Kuomintang military and political organs used huge amounts of public funds to fraudulently obtain gold and diverted "production" loans for gold speculation. The report also admits that "the inflation of legal tender, the shaking of credit, and the people's scramble to abandon legal tender" are the main reasons for gold price fluctuations.

According to another Central News Agency report on the 15th: Following Song Ziwen's resignation as the Kuomintang Executive Yuan President, which was "replaced" by Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang Control Yuan, based on the above investigation, filed an "impeachment" against Bei Zuyi and others, demanding that they be "severely punished." The "impeachment" letter reveals an important fact, that the direct cause of this gold rush was the Central Bank's suspension of gold sales. According to Bei Zuyi, it was decided solely on the basis of "Chairman's instruction," which shows that Chiang Kai-shek bears direct responsibility for this gold rush.

    蒋介石造成黄金潮
    主使贝祖诒利用“中央银行”操纵黄金买卖
    【新华社延安十八日电】根据最近中央社消息：国民党监察院关于上月中旬蒋管区黄金潮之报告书证明蒋家朝廷之“国家银行”中央银行即系此次金潮之直接促成者。该报告书透露：中央银行“与商人勾结图利，在极度便利条件下，形成此次金价波动。”“央行一意跟随黑市，且有迎头赶上领导黑市之嫌。”“二月八、九两日央行突然中止黄金之配售，以至金价扶摇直上”，为造成此次金潮之直接原因。报告揭露该行总裁贝祖诒与上海大投机商人，黑市金号老板詹莲生勾结，操纵黄金买卖之各种事实称：中央银行自去年三月八日实行黄金买卖以来，买卖“方式与手续，向无明文规定，任凭一己关系决定。”“仅有每日向宋子文个人所作之英文报告，一切明售暗配之数显与价格，均仅凭贝祖诒与詹莲生之“对讲电话”而定，央行金条之分与配售，皆由詹莲生负责经手，央行指定代行配售之五家金号，皆归詹控制。据调查仅今年一月四日至二月九日一个月间，央行委托五家金号配售之黄金即达七十九万二千八百二十两，詹直属之同丰裕金号即经手配售四十三万五千九百七十两，央行事实上供给詹莲生售金全部底细及国民党黄金“政策”之一切秘密，詹洞悉央行一年来售金总数，二月九日央行停售黄金前半小时，詹乘机购进大量黄金，以便囤积操纵。报告称：央行管理黄金库账之襄理王松涛，亦有黄金交易行为。报告复揭露国民党高级军政机关利用巨额公款骗取黄金，及将“生产”贷款移作黄金投机之事实。报告亦承认：“法币膨胀，信用动摇，人民争相抛弃法币，”是金价波动之主要原因。
    据中央社十五日另息：继宋子文辞职国民党行政院长由蒋介石“瓜代”后，国民党监察院复根据上述调查，提出对贝祖诒等之“弹劾”，要求予彼等以“严惩”。该“弹劾”书中泄露一重要事实，即造成此次黄金潮之直接原因，即央行之停售黄金一事。据贝祖诒称：仅奉“主席论令”而决定者，此显示蒋介石对此次金潮负有直接责任。
